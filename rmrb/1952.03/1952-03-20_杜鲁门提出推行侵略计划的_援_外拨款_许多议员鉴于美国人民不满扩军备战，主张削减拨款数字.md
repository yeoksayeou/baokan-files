Xinhua News Agency, 15th. On the 6th and 7th of this month, U.S. President Truman successively submitted to the U.S. Congress a message continuing to promote the so-called "Mutual Security Program" and a report on the implementation of the program in 1951. On the evening of the 6th, he also delivered a radio address to the nation on this matter. In his lengthy messages, reports, and speeches, Truman fiercely attacked those within the American ruling clique who opposed the Truman-Acheson policies, which had already suffered shameful defeats. At the same time, he reiterated the U.S.'s determination to continue pursuing these current aggressive policies, which the opponents believed would bring greater disasters to the American rulers.

The documents proposed by Truman openly declared the U.S. government's attempt to continue accelerating the aggressive plan of military expansion and war preparations around the world in the name of "mutual security." Truman clarified at the beginning of his report that the goal of the so-called "Mutual Security Program" was to "establish a position of strength in all parts of the free world" (referring to the capitalist world). From the plan announced by Truman, it can be seen that the so-called "position of strength" is a strategic position for aggression, first and foremost a military strategic position. Truman revealed that in the past two years, the U.S. has allocated a total of more than 8.7 billion U.S. dollars worth of so-called military "aid" to various vassal states and puppet regimes to accelerate the preparation for aggressive wars on the Eurasian continent and support anti-popular puppet regimes in Europe and Asia. This includes airplanes, artillery, tanks, and other weapons used to oppose the People's Army in Vietnam and suppress the people demanding independence in Tunisia. Truman ferociously boasted in the report about his so-called "achievements" in war preparations in Europe, saying, "In 1952, (European) troops who have been trained will be put in a combat-effective state." In Asia, he said that U.S. military delegations were stationed in Indochina, Thailand, the Philippines, and Taiwan, and that these delegations directly controlled these areas. Truman also specifically reiterated the U.S. government's determination to continue supporting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan, in a vain attempt to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. This once again exposed the U.S. imperialism's ferocious determination to be enemies with the Chinese people to the end. He emphasized that "military assistance must be used to assist the Chinese government in Taiwan." He revealed that since June 1950, 60 percent of the U.S.'s so-called economic appropriations for Southeast Asia have been supplied to the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan.

In order to continue promoting this aggressive war preparation plan, Truman requested in the message the continued implementation of the so-called "Mutual Security Program" and allocated 7.9 billion U.S. dollars for the program in the 1952-1953 fiscal year. This is an increase of nearly 10 percent compared to the previous year, of which "direct military assistance" (military equipment) accounts for 5.35 billion, and the so-called "supporting defense assistance" aimed at increasing Western European arms production is 1.819 billion. The two items combined account for about 91 percent of the total military war preparation expenses. The remaining more than 650 million U.S. dollars are used in the name of economic and technical "assistance" to achieve the sinister purpose of infiltrating and controlling economically backward countries. In explaining his request for this appropriation, Truman showed particular covetousness toward India.

These three documents, which Truman issued in quick succession over a twenty-four-hour period, spare no effort to defend the current U.S. aggressive policy, which has been running into brick walls everywhere. But in his defense, Truman unconsciously exposed that the so-called "assistance" is actually the selfish and self-serving imperialist ambition to enslave and plunder the "aided" countries. He shamelessly admitted that the U.S.'s plan, which is beautifully named "mutual security," is actually for "selfish purposes," to "enable them (the 'aided' countries) to realize our (U.S.) military and economic plans." He even specifically stated that the so-called "assistance" is actually a synonym for obtaining cannon fodder, bases, and raw materials. He said: "If it were not for their (the 'aided' countries) armed forces, bases on their territory, and raw materials in their mines and forests, our military strength to defend the United States (another name for aggression) would be greatly hampered, and our entire economy would be severely weakened." From this perspective, Truman angrily rebuked a group within the U.S. ruling clique who advocated first concentrating on managing the Western Hemisphere's aggressive base camp in order to avoid "overextension" and bankruptcy, saying that this was a policy of "self-destruction." He emphasized in the report that it was even more hopeless for the U.S. to carry out aggression single-handedly. He argued that there was "no other way for U.S. imperialism to follow" except to follow his path.

However, even Truman himself, while touting his own aggressive policies, could not conceal the fundamental fact that this aggressive policy has suffered failures and is besieged on all sides. He admitted that in Europe, which he had once greatly touted as having achieved "revival" with U.S. "aid," the actual situation was that "foreign exchange difficulties are increasing," and there is an "imminent threat of rampant inflation." The so-called "united Europe" plan, a major component of the Truman-Acheson policy, is also facing "great difficulties" and "progress is not always as fast as we (the U.S.) would like." In the Near East and Africa, another strategic region in the U.S. imperialist plan, anti-imperialist nationalism has experienced "violent outbreaks," "posing serious challenges to American politicians." In the Far East, the movement for people's liberation has reached a point where "weapons of war cannot contain it" and must be "addressed with more appropriate means." Even in Latin America, right under the U.S.'s nose, nationalism and "neutralism" are "leading to paths that create friction with the United States." Truman could not hide his own concerns, namely: in these vast so-called "backward regions" of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, people have a "new, ardent determination" to demand independence and liberation, and it has already "erupted into fierce nationalism."

In this way, although Truman desperately refuted the claims of Hoover and others, who, in view of the danger of the Truman policy leading to the bankruptcy of U.S. imperialism, demanded a change in aggressive policy, he could not deny the facts that these critics of the current policy cited as cause for concern. While saying that doing things according to Hoover's method would also result in "self-destruction," Truman, on the other hand, used a purely American capitalist businessman's tone to peddle his own aggressive plan to his audience, saying that it was the "most cost-effective" and "least expensive" policy. But Truman ultimately could not prove that the money he spent would bring any real achievement in improving the fundamental situation of U.S. imperialism. Therefore, although Truman made many arrangements for the effect of this proposed plan, according to the Americans themselves, the response was extremely lukewarm. A United Press report on the 6th said: "Congressmen apparently do not believe him (Truman)." Many congressmen, in this election year, in view of the growing dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the American people with the heavy burden imposed on them by the Truman administration's expansion plans, have expressed their intention to cut Truman's requested "aid" appropriations. Among these congressmen are Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Russell, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Richards, and House Democratic Leader Priest, all of whom have consistently supported Truman's policies. The internal squabble within the U.S. ruling clique over the "aid" issue reflects the extreme confusion within the U.S. ruling clique in the face of the widespread failure of its aggressive policies, and also proves that the Truman-Acheson foreign expansion and aggression policy is increasingly losing support at home.

    杜鲁门提出推行侵略计划的“援”外拨款
    许多议员鉴于美国人民不满扩军备战，主张削减拨款数字
    【新华社十五日讯】本月六日、七日，美国总统杜鲁门先后向美国国会提出继续推行所谓“共同安全计划”的咨文和一九五一年该计划执行情况的报告，六日晚并为此向全国发表广播演说。杜鲁门在他的冗长的咨文、报告和演说中，大肆攻击在美国统治集团内部反对已经遭受可耻失败的杜鲁门—艾奇逊的政策的人，同时再次表明美国决心继续推行这些反对者认为是替美国统治者带来更大灾难的现行侵略政策。
    杜鲁门提出的这些文件，公开宣布了美国政府妄图继续假“共同安全”的名义、加紧在全世界推行扩军备战的侵略计划。杜鲁门在报告中开头就阐明所谓“共同安全计划”的目标，是“在自由世界
    （按指资本主义世界）各地建立实力地位”。从杜鲁门所宣布的计划中可以看出，所谓“实力地位”，就是进行侵略的战略地位，首先是军事战略地位。杜鲁门透露，两年来，美国为加紧对欧亚大陆侵略战争的准备和支持欧、亚两洲反人民的傀儡政权，共拨给各仆从国家和傀儡政权价值达八十七亿多美元的所谓军事“援助”，其中包括在越南反对人民军和在突尼斯镇压要求独立的人民的飞机、大炮、坦克及其他武器。杜鲁门在报告里穷凶极恶地夸耀他在欧洲进行备战的所谓“成就”，并说：“一九五二年要使经过训练的（欧洲）军队处在有作战效力的状态。”在亚洲方面，他说，美国的军事代表团定驻于印度支那、泰国、菲律宾和台湾等地，这些代表团直接控制着这些地区。杜鲁门还特别重申美国政府决心继续扶持台湾蒋介石匪帮，妄图阻止中国人民解放台湾，这就是再一次暴露了美帝国主义决心和中国人民为敌到底的凶恶面目。他强调“必须以军事援助协助台湾的中国政府”。他透露，自一九五○年六月以来，美国用于东南亚的所谓经济拨款，有百分之六十是供给台湾国民党残匪的。
    为了继续推行这个侵略备战计划，杜鲁门在咨文中要求继续实施所谓“共同安全计划”，并在一九五二——一九五三年度中为该项计划拨款七十九亿美元，这个数目比上一年度增加近百分之十，其中“直接军事援助”（军事装备）占五十三亿五千万，以增加西欧军火生产为目的的所谓“支持防御援助”为十八亿一千九百万，两项合计军事备战费用占总数的约百分之九十一。其余六亿五千多万美元，则在经济、技术“援助”的名义下，用来达到渗入和控制经济落后国家的阴险目的。在为他的这一笔拨款要求进行解释时，杜鲁门表露特别垂涎于印度。
    杜鲁门在二十四小时中间接连发表的这三个文件，竭力为已经到处碰壁的美国现行侵略政策辩护。但在辩解中，杜鲁门却不自觉地暴露了，所谓“援助”，其实就是自私自利的奴役和掠夺受“援”国家的帝国主义野心。他恬不知耻地承认，美国的这个美其名为“共同安全”的计划，实际上是为了“利己的目的”，是为了“使它们（受‘援’国）能够实现我们（美国）的军事和经济计划”。他甚至具体地表明，所谓“援助”，其实是为了取得炮灰、基地和原料的代名词。他说：“假使没有它们（受‘援’国）的武装部队，没有它们领土上的基地，没有它们矿山与森林中的原料，我们的军事力量要保卫美国（进行侵略的别名）就会大受妨碍，我们的整个经济就会严重削弱。”从这个角度，杜鲁门痛骂美国统治集团内部一批主张首先集中力量经营西半球侵略大本营、以免“伸展过度”而招致破产的人，说他们这是“自取灭亡”的政策。他在报告里着重说明，美国要想单枪匹马进行侵略是更加没有希望的。他争论说，除了走他的路线，美帝国主义“别无他途可循”。
    但是，甚至杜鲁门本人在吹嘘他自己的这套侵略政策的时候，仍无法掩饰这一侵略政策已遭受失败和四面楚歌的根本事实。他承认：在他曾经大事吹嘘已在美国“援助”下获得“复兴”的欧洲，实际情况是“外汇的困难日益增加”，而且存在着“如脱韁之马一般的通货膨胀的眼前威胁”。作为杜鲁门—艾奇逊政策的一个主要组成部分的所谓“统一欧洲”计划，也是“困难很大”，“进展并不总是像我们（美国）所希望的那样快”。在美国帝国主义计划中的另一个战略地区近东和非洲，反对帝国主义的民族主义已发生“猛烈的爆发”，“向美国的政治家提出了严重的挑战”。在远东，人民要求解放的运动也已到了“战争武器不能遏止”的程度，而必须“以比较适当的手段来应付挑战”。甚至在美国鼻子底下的拉丁美洲，民族主义和“中立主义”也在“导向造成和美国摩擦的途径”。杜鲁门掩盖不住他自己的忧虑，就是：在这些亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲广大的所谓“落后地区”里，人民有着一种要求独立解放的“新的炽热的决心”，并且已经“爆发成为激烈的民族主义”。
    这样，杜鲁门虽然声嘶力竭地驳斥胡佛等一批人鉴于杜鲁门政策所包含的使美帝国主义破产的危险而要求改换侵略政策的主张，却无法否认这些攻击现行政策的人们所引为忧虑的事实。杜鲁门一方面说，按照胡佛等人的办法做，结果也是“自取灭亡”，一方面则用纯粹美国资本主义社会中的商人口吻向他的听众兜售他自己的侵略计划，说它是“最上算的”、“花费最少的”政策。但是杜鲁门终究无法证明他所花的钱在改善美帝国主义的基本处境上会有任何真正的成就。所以虽然杜鲁门对于这次提出计划的效果作了许多布置，但据美国人自己报道，反应却极为冷淡。合众社六日消息说：“国会议员显然都不相信他（杜鲁门）的话。”许多议员在这大选年中，鉴于广大美国人民日益不满于杜鲁门政府的扩张计划所加给他们的沉重负担，都纷纷表示主张削减杜鲁门所要求的“援”外拨款。在这些议员中间，有参院外交委员会主席康纳利、参院军事委员会主席鲁塞尔、众院外委会主席李查兹、众院民主党领袖普列斯特等素来支持杜鲁门政策的国会首脑。美国统治集团内部关于“援”外问题上已开始的争吵，反映了美国统治集团内部在侵略政策到处失败面前的极度混乱，也证明了杜鲁门—艾奇逊的对外扩张侵略政策在国内也愈来愈得不到支持了。
