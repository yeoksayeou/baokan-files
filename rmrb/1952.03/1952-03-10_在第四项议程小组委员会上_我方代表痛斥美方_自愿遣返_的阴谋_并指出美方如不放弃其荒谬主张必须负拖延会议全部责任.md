Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th - The so-called "voluntary repatriation" claim insisted upon by the other side in the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee has been nakedly exposed in the face of irrefutable facts. It is entirely a conspiracy to deprive our captured personnel of their right to be repatriated and an attempt to detain our captured personnel, and it blatantly and unscrupulously uses threats and coercion to forcibly tattoo war prisoners, even resorting to bayonets and grenades to achieve this conspiracy. At the subcommittee meeting on March 9th, our representative ruthlessly exposed and vehemently condemned this conspiracy. Our representative sternly pointed out: "The bloodstains on Geoje Island are not yet dry, and your side's various conspiracies in coordination with so-called 'voluntary repatriation' are still ongoing, and serious incidents are still being created. Your side is condoning, instigating, and colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the South Korean authorities to expand threats and coercion against our war prisoners, openly operating in Geoje Island and Busan. For example, in your prisoner-of-war camps No. 68 and No. 72, our captured personnel are being coerced into organizing so-called 'Anti-Communist and Resist-Russia Alliance,' tattooing their bodies, signing blood oaths, and instigating hunger strikes and writing death warrants, etc. As I have already pointed out in the past, your side's reckless conspiratorial activities are extremely dangerous. We absolutely cannot tolerate your inhumane and barbaric behavior. Our side absolutely cannot accept your so-called 'voluntary repatriation' principle, which is aimed at detaining our captured personnel."

Our representative further sternly warned the other side that their irresponsible fabrication that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting in Korea transported the prisoners of war they received to the territory of the People's Republic of China is a malicious slander with no basis whatsoever. In fact, it is the other side that is engaging in all kinds of lawless, barbaric, insidious activities in its prisoner-of-war camps, in collusion with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. Our representative pointed out that if the other side does not promptly stop such irresponsible fabrications and lawless activities, it will take the current Korean armistice negotiations beyond their proper scope, thereby threatening the future of the Korean armistice negotiations. Our representative further solemnly pointed out that if the other side continues to disregard our reasonable proposals, continues to spread rumors and slander, and insists on its absurd claims, refusing to resolve the problem, then the responsibility for delaying the meeting rests entirely with the other side.

    在第四项议程小组委员会上
    我方代表痛斥美方“自愿遣返”的阴谋
    并指出美方如不放弃其荒谬主张必须负拖延会议全部责任
    【新华社开城九日电】对方在第四项议程小组委员会上所坚持的所谓“自愿遣返”的主张，在铁的事实面前已经赤裸裸地暴露出来，完全是剥夺我方被俘人员被遣返的权利和企图扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋，并公然肆无忌惮地以威胁强迫的手段在战俘身上强行刺字，甚至不惜以刺刀、手榴弹为手段来实现这种阴谋。在三月九日的小组委员会上，我方代表对这种阴谋予以无情的揭露，并痛加斥责。我方代表严词指出：“巨济岛上的血迹未干，你方配合所谓‘自愿遣返’的种种阴谋策动仍在进行，严重的事件仍在制造之中。你方正在纵容、唆使并伙同蒋介石匪帮和南朝鲜当局对我方战俘扩大进行威胁强迫，在巨济岛和釜山公开活动。例如在你方战俘营第六十八和第七十二营房，胁迫我方被俘人员组织所谓‘反共抗俄同盟’，在身上刺字，签写血书，并策动绝食和写绝命书等等。如我过去所已经指出的，你方这种不顾后果的阴谋活动具有极大的危险性。我们绝对不能容忍你方这种毫无人性的野蛮的行为。我方绝对不能接受你方以扣留我方被俘人员为目的的所谓‘自愿遣返’的原则。”
    我方代表更严词正告对方，对方不负责任地捏造说：在朝鲜作战的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军将他们所收容的战俘运到中华人民共和国境内。这是一种含血喷人的诡计，没有任何根据的。事实上正是对方自己在其战俘营内伙同台湾蒋介石匪帮和李承晚匪帮进行种种无法无天的野蛮阴险的活动。我方代表指出对方如不及时停止这种不负责任的捏造和无法无天的活动，势将使目前的朝鲜停战谈判超出其应有的范围，因而威胁到朝鲜停战谈判的前途。我方代表并进一步严正指出，如果对方仍然置我方的合理建议于不顾，继续进行造谣诬蔑，并坚持其荒谬主张，拒绝解决问题，则拖延会议的责任全在对方。
