A Letter from Ma Fangming and Others of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the Workers of the Motherland Stores

Dear worker comrades of national stores:

From the day we arrived on the Korean front to fight the American aggressors, we have always been grateful for the warm support and love of the people of the motherland. When we marched with sixty or seventy pounds on our backs, as long as someone said that we were soldiers carrying the hopes of the people of the motherland, we felt full of energy, not tired, and walked faster. When camping in the wooded mountains, the thought of the lovely babies of the motherland sleeping sweetly in their mothers' arms, and the machines in large and small factories all running, made us forget the cold and pain. When we received things sent from the motherland, we jumped up with joy. We know that these are all obtained by the hard work and frugality of the people of the motherland. Encouraged by this enthusiastic support, every comrade is determined to answer the people of the motherland by winning more battles and eliminating more enemies. We will not forget the great and lovable motherland, and we believe that the people of the motherland will not forget us. Who knew that there were unscrupulous merchants who secretly released poisonous arrows and helped American imperialism to kill us? When we ate stinky canned food and spoiled egg powder and dried tofu, we thought it was due to poor storage by the logistics department. Some iron picks cracked shortly after being used, and some iron shovels split in half shortly after being used. We thought it was because the industrial conditions in the motherland were not good! Now we know it was the trick of the traitorous merchants. These conscienceless villains have forgotten the oppression of imperialism and bureaucratic capital in the past, and forgotten that the People's Government saved them from difficult circumstances. They secretly helped American imperialism to kill us and undermine the work of resisting America and aiding Korea. Aren't these traitors of the motherland and criminals of the people?

Dear worker comrades of the stores: We were simply furious when we saw this news. Some thought of the comrades who died unfortunately from canned food poisoning and shed tears of sadness. Worker comrades of the stores, can you allow these treacherous merchants to engage in the despicable act of killing us? Can you allow them to hang the Chinese sign and sabotage our motherland for the enemy? We believe you will never tolerate them. We hope that you will unite and, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, take active action to completely eliminate these vicious wolves—the running dogs of American imperialism. In particular, the worker comrades in industrial and commercial stores who have had economic dealings with our volunteer army, we hope that you will expose all these bad things and not let one of them escape. This is equivalent to consolidating our rear position and making us have no worries. We have full confidence and courage to defeat the American aggressors until they abandon their aggression plan and sincerely accept a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

Worker comrades of the stores: Let us work together to win victories together on the Korean front and at home, to defend our great motherland, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world!

With revolutionary greetings!

Ma Fangming, Wang Yu, Liu Changren, Mu Zhendong, Chang Jingquan, Song Chunqian, Li Ping'an, of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

    志愿军某部马昉明等给祖国店员工人的一封信亲爱的全国店员工人同志们：
    我们自到朝鲜前线和美国侵略者战斗的那一天起，无时不在感激祖国人民的热情支援和爱护。我们背着六七十斤重的东西行军时，只要有人一说我们是肩负着祖国人民的希望的战士，就感到浑身是劲，不觉累，走的也快了。露宿在长满树木的山头时，一想起祖国可爱的婴儿甜蜜地睡在妈妈的怀里，大小工厂的机器都在开动，便不觉得寒冷和痛苦。一接到从祖国送来的东西，便高兴的跳起来。我们知道，这都是祖国人民用辛勤劳动和省吃俭用得来的。为这种热情支援所鼓舞，每个同志都下定决心用多打胜仗，多消灭敌人来回答祖国人民。我们忘不了伟大可爱的祖国，也相信祖国人民忘不了我们。谁知道竟有丧心病狂的奸商，暗放毒箭，帮助美帝国主义来杀害我们，我们吃到臭罐头，和变坏了的蛋粉、豆腐干时，还以为是后勤部门保管不好所致。有的铁镐使不久尖就裂了，铁铣也有使不久就裂成两半的，我们还以为是祖国的工业条件不好呢！现在才知道是奸商干的勾当。这些毫无良心的坏蛋，忘记了过去帝国主义和官僚资本的压迫，忘记了人民政府从困难的环境中救过他们，竟暗中帮助美帝国主义来杀害我们，破坏抗美援朝工作，这难道不是祖国的叛徒、人民的罪人吗？
    亲爱的店员工人同志们：我们看到这个消息时，简直气坏了。有的想起吃罐头中毒而不幸牺牲的同志，难过得流下泪来。店员工人同志们，你们能容许这些狼心狗肺的奸商干着杀害我们的卑鄙勾当吗？能容许他们挂着中国人的牌子替敌人破坏我们的祖国吗？我们相信你们决不会容忍他们的。希望你们团结一致，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，积极行动起来，彻底肃清这些狠心狼——美帝国主义的走狗。特别是和我们志愿军有过经济来往的工商业里的店员工人同志们，更希望你们把这些坏东西全部检举出来，不让他们漏网一个。这就等于巩固了我们的后方阵地，使我们无后顾之忧。我们完全有信心和勇气打败美国侵略者，直到它放弃侵略计划，诚心接受和平解决朝鲜问题为止。
    店员工人同志们：让我们共同努力，争取在朝鲜前线和国内，共同打胜仗，保卫我们伟大的祖国，保卫远东和世界的和平！
    此致革命的敬礼！
    中国人民志愿军某部马昉明、王俞、刘昌人、穆振宗、常经权、宋纯千、李平安
