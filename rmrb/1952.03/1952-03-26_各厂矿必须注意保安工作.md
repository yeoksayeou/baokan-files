    All Factories and Mines Must Pay Attention to Security Work
    Recently, many factories and mines have continuously experienced accidents resulting in injuries and deaths, endangering the safety of workers and causing serious losses to national wealth. In state-owned factories and mines under the Northeast Industrial Department, from January to March 7th, 35 major accidents resulting in injuries or deaths occurred, causing 40 worker deaths. There were 11 major fires, and the losses to production equipment alone amounted to more than 18 billion yuan. In the Guchuan, Gangu, and Wushan engineering sections of the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau, three major accidents also occurred in succession. The number of responsibility accidents at the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot has also been increasing month by month recently.
    The occurrence of these accidents is inseparable from the serious bureaucratic work style of factory and mine leaders who neglect security work and do not care about worker safety. Since the leadership organs at all levels issued instructions to strengthen daily business work, the phenomenon of many factory and mine cadres neglecting production has been gradually changing, but they have not yet paid attention to the issues related to worker safety in production. The security responsibility system and inspection system that many factories and mines had established in the past have largely failed to be consistently implemented, and many factory and mine leaders still adopt a perfunctory attitude after accidents occur, which is absolutely not allowed. For example, in the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot, the number of accidents increased to 21 in the first half of March, but the leading cadres only asked the workers involved in the accidents to write self-criticisms, without conducting self-criticisms themselves or proposing solutions. Some Party organizations and administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres mistakenly believed that security work was the responsibility of the technical security departments and had nothing to do with themselves. During the "Three-Anti" campaign, some cadres even put worker safety education out of their minds. As a result, a phenomenon of neglecting labor discipline and failing to comply with safety technical regulations arose among workers, leading to an increase in accidents resulting in injuries and deaths.
    Strengthening security work in factories and mines is a very urgent task. All factories and mines should immediately mobilize the masses to conduct a general inspection of security work, formulate effective measures, and quickly improve it.

### 各厂矿必须注意保安工作

    各厂矿必须注意保安工作
    许多厂矿近来不断发生伤亡事故，危害了职工的安全，并使国家财富遭受了严重的损失。东北工业部所属的国营厂矿，从一月到三月七日，先后发生三十五次重大伤亡事故，死职工四十名；发生重大火灾十一次，仅生产设备遭受的损失就有一百八十多亿元。西北铁路干线工程局固川、甘谷、武山各工程段，也接连发生三次重大事故。张家口机务段的责任事故，近来也逐月增加。
    这些事故的发生，是和厂矿领导干部忽视保安工作、不关心工人安全的严重的官僚主义作风分不开的。自从各级领导机关发出加强日常业务工作的指示以后，许多厂矿干部忽视生产的现象已在逐渐改变，但是他们对于生产中有关职工安全的问题，却还没有加以重视。许多厂矿过去已经建立的保安责任制和检查制度，也大都未能坚持执行，许多厂矿发生事故以后，领导干部仍然抱着敷衍了事的态度，这是绝对不能容许的。如张家口机务段，三月份上半月事故增至二十一件，但领导干部只让发生事故的职工写检讨书，自己却不进行检讨，不提出克服的办法。有些党的组织和行政、工会、青年团的干部，竟错误地认为保安工作是技术保安部门的事，和自己无关。对职工的保安教育，在“三反”期间，更被某些干部置之脑后。因而在职工中间产生了忽视劳动纪律和不遵守保安技术规程的现象，伤亡事故因而增加。
    加强工矿中的保安工作，是一个十分紧迫的任务。各厂矿应当立即发动群众，对保安工作普遍进行一次检查，定出有效的办法，迅速加以改善。
