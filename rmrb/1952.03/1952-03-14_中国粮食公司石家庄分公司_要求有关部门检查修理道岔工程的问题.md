    China National Grain Company Shijiazhuang Branch
    Requests Relevant Departments to Inspect and Repair Railroad Switch Project Issues
    To the Editor: With the approval of higher authorities, our company established a new warehouse in the latter half of last year and planned to build a dedicated railroad switch for this warehouse. Last April, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Trade, we reported the annual transport volume and the surveyed engineering drawings to higher authorities for review. In October, we received a notice from the Shijiazhuang Railway Branch Bureau approving our company to build a dedicated railroad switch and instructing us to prepay the funds. After obtaining approval from higher authorities, we paid 3.5 billion yuan (the total project cost was more than 3.9 billion yuan). The Railway Bureau immediately started construction, first building the roadbed. However, in November, the entire project suddenly stopped, and the Railway Bureau did not explain the reason. Upon our inquiry, they said: "The suspension of work is according to instructions from higher authorities, and construction can only be decided after the higher authorities review and approve." A second negotiation yielded no results. The entire project has been stalled until now. In the meantime, we have twice requested instructions from the Ministry of Railways and asked relevant leading departments such as the Ministry of Trade to inquire about this issue with the Ministry of Railways, but we still have not received a response. We have completed the construction of the warehouse, but because there is no railroad switch, we can only use horse-drawn carts and handcarts to transport grain from the station into the warehouse. According to our calculations, transporting in this manner will result in a loss of 3.1 billion yuan per year. We urgently request that relevant departments promptly send an inspection team to understand the situation so that the project can resume work as soon as possible.

    中国粮食公司石家庄分公司
    要求有关部门检查修理道岔工程的问题
    编辑同志：我公司在前年下半年经上级批准建立新仓库，并拟为这个仓库修建专用铁路道岔。去年四月，我们根据中央铁道部和贸易部的指示，把全年运输量、测绘的工程图等报告上级审核。十月，我们先后接到石家庄铁路分局的通知，准给我公司修专用道岔一条，并嘱预缴款项。我们呈请上级批准后，就缴了三十五亿元（全部工程费是三十九亿多元）。路局当即开工，先建筑路基。但到了十一月份，全部工程突然停顿，路局方面也不说明理由。经我们询问，他们才说：“停工系奉上级指示，待上级审查合格后才能决定施工与否。”第二次交涉也没有结果。全部工程就这样停顿到现在。中间我们曾两次请示铁道部，并请求贸易部等有关领导部门向铁道部转询这个问题，但依然没有回音。我们已建妥了仓库，因没有道岔，只能用马车、人力车从车站搬运粮食入库。据我们计算，以这种方式搬运，每年要损失三十一亿元。我们急迫地要求有关部门迅速派检查组了解情况，使工程早日复工。
