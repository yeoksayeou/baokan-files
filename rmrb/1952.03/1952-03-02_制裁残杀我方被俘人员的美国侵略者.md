A speech for propagandists:

Sanction the American Aggressors Who Massacred Our Captured Personnel

On February 18th, American aggressors perpetrated a bloody massacre of our captured personnel on a large scale at the Koje-do prisoner of war camp in southern Korea. On the morning of that day, an American army surrounded more than 5,000 unarmed captured personnel of our side in the 62nd prisoner of war camp. American personnel then conducted a terrorizing "individual interrogation" of our captured personnel, forcing them to state that they were unwilling to be repatriated after the signing of the Korean armistice agreement. When our captured personnel refused this illegal "interrogation" and "screening," the American army carried out a collective massacre of them. According to news released by the Americans themselves, 75 of our captured personnel were killed on the spot, and 139 were wounded. This is yet another heinous crime by the American aggressors, who have lost all conscience, violated human justice and international law, and massacred prisoners of war.

The bloody crimes of the American aggressors in mistreating and massacring our captured personnel are too numerous to recount. The American prisoner of war camps in Koje-do, Suwon and other places are all hellholes. In these American prisoner of war camps, the Americans frequently used the most cruel and inhumane tortures against captured personnel of the Chinese and Korean People's forces, such as pouring gasoline into their mouths and burning them; blinding them with strong electric lights; peeling off their fingernails; branding their bodies with red-hot iron bars; and dragging them into the field to be shot as moving targets. As for the women among our captured personnel, they were even more barbaric and shameless, often raping them before cutting off their breasts and chopping off their hands and feet; or pouring gasoline on them and burning them alive. In the American prisoner of war camp in Suwon, there was a "special prison" filled with rotting corpses, a "special torture chamber" dedicated to torture, a "special cell" where large numbers of poisonous mosquitoes were bred, and a "steam cell" where people were steamed alive in wooden cabinets. In the Koje-do prisoner of war camp, the Americans even more barbarically and shamelessly tattooed anti-communist slogans on our captured personnel. According to the United Press news agency of the United States itself, among the 17,000 Chinese prisoners of war in the first prisoner of war camp, as many as 3,000 had been tattooed with the Chinese or English words "Anti-Communist and Resist Russia." United Press admitted: "The concentration camp center has become an island of terror," "Torture and assassination are interwoven into a terrifying picture in the daily lives of the prisoners." The American aggressors not only used heinous tortures to mistreat and kill our captured personnel, but also used our captured personnel as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons outside Wonsan harbor and on Koje-do, causing thousands of our captured personnel to contract various serious diseases, resulting in their deaths. According to a telegram sent by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council on November 19th of last year, according to extremely incomplete statistics, in the first ten months of last year alone, 17,000 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers were killed, harmed, or starved to death. Such inhumane, cruel and murderous behavior by the American aggressor army has led even Osborne, a war correspondent for the most reactionary American magazines "Fortune" and "Life" in Korea, to admit that the American aggression against Korea is an "ugly war."

The above series of large-scale massacres of prisoners of war is by no means something that individual American officers, soldiers, or other individual personnel could have done, but rather was done consciously and deliberately by the headquarters of the American aggressor army and the American government, and consciously and deliberately by the American monopoly capitalists who dream of dominating the world and making a fortune from war, and their political and military agents.

Have the American aggressors not degenerated into a gang of bandits and murderers, a pack of man-eating and blood-drinking beasts? If anyone still says that the American bourgeoisie has "civilization" and "democracy," speaks of "reason" and "humanity," and if anyone still wants to peddle these most hypocritical and absurd "pro-American ideas," then these people have lost all conscience!

The American aggressors have already committed the most heinous, barbaric, despicable, and ugly atrocities in the history of mankind. The American aggressors have challenged human justice and conscience, and all just and conscientious people in the world must not tolerate them and must resolutely sanction them!

The American aggressors have already massacred thousands upon thousands of captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and have already massacred the most outstanding heroic sons and daughters of China and Korea. Our great Chinese people and Korean people must not tolerate this and must resolutely sanction them!

Patriotic compatriots throughout the country, we must never tolerate the American bandits who barbarously murder our heroic children and insult our great motherland. All of us patriotic people must forever remember this hatred as deep as the sea. Fathers and mothers, elder brothers and elder sisters, must educate our children, educate our younger brothers and younger sisters, and tell them never to forget this blood feud.

Patriotic compatriots throughout the country, we must severely sanction the American murderers. We must hold the American government and the headquarters of the American army responsible for the large-scale and planned criminal acts of massacring our captured personnel. For those responsible for these crimes that destroy humanity and international law, we have ample reason to, in accordance with the 1943 Allied declaration on "severely punishing war criminals," demand that they be listed as war criminals and demand that they be submitted to a world people's public trial.

The reason why the American murderers are intensifying their massacre of our captured personnel, especially the reason why they created the Koje-do massacre on February 18, is to attempt to force our captured personnel to submit through terror and massacre, so as to detain our captured personnel under the absurd pretext of the "principle of voluntary repatriation," in order to continue to obstruct and undermine the Korean armistice negotiations. But this massacre fully proves that the so-called expression of "free will" under the American guns is fundamentally impossible. Because as soon as our captured personnel refused this illegal "interrogation" based on free will, the American murderers immediately carried out a massacre against them. The refusal of our captured personnel to accept the illegal "interrogation" of the American aggressor bandits fully proves the great spirit of the captured personnel of the Chinese and Korean People's forces who cannot be subdued by force, and has made the absurd proposal put forward by the American side in the Korean armistice negotiations that the repatriation of prisoners should be based on their "voluntary" in the eyes of the people of the world, completely bankrupt.

The blood everywhere in the American prisoner of war camps in Koje-do and Suwon and other places proves that the American aggressors are the deadly enemies of the people of the world, the deadly enemies of the Korean people, and the deadly enemies of the Chinese people. This bestial enemy is continuing to delay and obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations, continuing to invade Korea and occupy our country's territory of Taiwan, and is preparing for a new and larger-scale war of aggression in the Far East, aimed at the Chinese people and the people of Asia. All of us patriotic people must continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, continue to develop the movement of increasing production and practicing economy and the struggle against corruption, bribery, and theft, to support the anti-aggression struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. Until we achieve victory in resisting America and aiding Korea, until we achieve the goal of peacefully resolving the Korean issue and consolidating peace in the Far East and the world, until we achieve the goal of severely punishing the American murderers, our struggle against the American aggressors will resolutely not stop.

### 制裁残杀我方被俘人员的美国侵略者

专栏：宣传员的讲话

    制裁残杀我方被俘人员的美国侵略者
    二月十八日，美国侵略者在朝鲜南方的巨济岛上美方所设的俘虏营里，制造了大规模地屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥的大惨案。在这一天早晨，一支美国军队把第六十二号俘虏营的我方手无寸铁的被俘人员五千多人包围起来，由美方人员向我方被俘人员实行恐怖的“个别讯问”，强迫他们表示在朝鲜停战协定签字后不愿意被遣送回去。我方被俘人员拒绝这种非法的“讯问”和“甄别”，美国军队就对他们实行了集体的大屠杀。据美国自己公布的消息说，我方被俘人员当场被杀死七十五人，被杀伤一百三十九人。这是美国侵略者丧尽天良、破坏人类正义和国际公法，屠杀俘虏的又一次滔天罪行。
    美国侵略者虐待和屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥罪行，早已数不完说不尽。设在巨济岛和水原等地的美军战俘营，都是暗无天日的人间地狱。在这些美国战俘营里，美国人对待中朝人民部队被俘人员，经常使用最残酷无人道的各种毒刑，例如在口里灌汽油，用火来烧；用强烈的电光射瞎眼睛；剥去指甲；用烧红的铁条烙人身体；拉到野外当作活动靶子来射杀等等。至于对待我方被俘人员中的妇女，那就更加野蛮无耻，往往把她们强奸后，又割掉乳房，剁掉手足；或者在她们身上浇上汽油，活活烧死。在水原的美军战俘营里，有堆积着腐烂尸体的“特别监狱”，有专门进行毒刑拷打的“特刑室”，有养着大量有毒蚊子的“特别监”，还有把人关在木柜子里活活蒸死的“蒸气监”。在巨济岛的战俘营里，美国人更野蛮无耻地在我方被俘人员身上刺上反共标语。据美国自己的通讯社合众社的消息说：在第一战俘营的一万七千中国被俘人员中，竟有三千人已刺上中文的或英文的“反共抗俄”字样。合众社承认：“集中营中心变成了一个恐怖之岛”，“酷刑、暗杀在俘虏的日常生活中，交织成一幅恐怖的图画”。美国侵略者不但使用伤天害理的酷刑来虐待和杀害我方被俘人员，而且还在元山港外和巨济岛上，把我方被俘人员来作细菌武器的实验品，使我方上千上万的被俘人员染上各种厉害的疾病，以至于死亡。据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相在去年十一月十九日发给联合国大会和安理会主席的电报中指出，据极不完全的统计，仅在去年头十个多月里，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员被杀死、害死、饿死的，就有一万七千人。美国侵略军这种灭绝人性、虐待和屠杀俘虏的禽兽行为，使得美国最反动的“幸福”和“生活”杂志的驻朝鲜战地记者奥斯本，也不得不承认美国侵略朝鲜是一场“丑恶的战争”。
    上面这一连串的、大规模地屠杀俘虏的罪行，决不是美国个别军官、士兵或其他个别人员所能够做得出来的，而是美国侵略军总司令部和美国政府所有意识、有计划地做出来的，是妄想称霸世界、大发战争财的美国垄断资本家和他们的政治、军事代理人所有意识、有计划地做出来的。
    美国侵略者已经堕落成为一帮土匪和杀人犯，一群吃人喝血的野兽，难道这不是千真万确的事实吗？如果还有人说美国资产阶级有“文明”、有“民主”，讲“道理”、讲“人道”，如果还有人想要贩卖这些最虚伪、最荒唐的“崇美思想”，那么这些人就是丧尽天良了！
    美国侵略者已经干出了自有人类历史以来最伤天害理、最野蛮、最卑鄙、最丑恶的暴行。美国侵略者已经向人类的正义和良心挑战，全世界一切有正义感、有良心的人类，绝对不能容忍，一定要坚决起来制裁他们！
    美国侵略者已经屠杀了我们中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军成千成万的被俘人员，已经屠杀了朝中两国的成千上万的最优秀的英雄儿女，我们伟大的中国人民、朝鲜人民绝对不能容忍，一定要坚决起来制裁他们！
    全国爱国的同胞们，我们绝对不能够容忍野蛮地杀害我们的英雄子女、侮辱我们伟大祖国的美国强盗们。我们全体爱国的人民，要永远记住这种像海一样深的仇恨。做爸爸的、妈妈的，做大哥、大姊的，要教育我们的子女，教育我们的小弟弟、小妹妹，告诉他们永远不要忘记这种血海深仇。
    全国爱国的同胞们，我们一定要严厉制裁美国杀人犯。我们一定要追究美国政府和美军总司令部大规模地、有计划地屠杀我方被俘人员的犯罪行为的责任。对于犯了这种毁灭人道和国际公法的罪恶的负责人，我们有充分的理由根据一九四三年同盟国关于“严厉惩办战争罪犯”的宣言，要求把他们列为战争罪犯，并且要求把他们提交世界人民公审。
    美国杀人犯所以变本加厉地屠杀我方被俘人员，尤其是他们所以制造二月十八日的巨济岛大屠杀案，是企图以恐怖、屠杀的方法强迫我方被俘人员屈服，以便在“自愿遣返原则”的荒谬藉口下，扣留我方被俘人员，以便继续阻挠和破坏朝鲜停战谈判。但是这次大屠杀却充分证明，在美国枪口下的所谓“自由意志”的表现，是根本不可能的。因为只要我方被俘人员根据自由意志拒绝这种非法的“审问”，美国杀人犯就立刻对他们施行了大屠杀。我方被俘人员这次拒绝美国侵略强盗的非法“讯问”，充分证明了中朝人民部队被俘人员威武不能屈的伟大精神，并且使美国方面在朝鲜停战谈判中所提出的所谓俘虏是否遣返要根据他们的“自愿”的荒谬提案，在全世界人民的面前，陷于完全破产。
    巨济岛和水原等地美军战俘营中的遍地的鲜血，证明美国侵略者是世界人类的死敌，是朝鲜人民的死敌，是中国人民的死敌。这个兽性的敌人，正在继续拖延和阻挠朝鲜停战谈判，正在继续侵略朝鲜和侵占我国的领土台湾，并且正在准备新的更大规模的、以中国人民及亚洲人民为敌的远东侵略战争。我们全体爱国人民要再接再厉，继续加强抗美援朝工作，继续开展增产节约运动和反贪污、反行贿、反盗窃的斗争，来支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的反侵略斗争。一天不取得抗美援朝的胜利，一天不达到和平解决朝鲜问题、巩固远东和世界和平的目的，一天不达到严惩美国杀人犯的目的，我们反对美国侵略者的斗争，就坚决不停止。
