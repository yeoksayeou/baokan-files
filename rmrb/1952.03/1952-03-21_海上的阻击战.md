    In the amphibious operation to attack the islands north of the Cheongcheon River, two gunboats of a certain naval defense unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army engaged in a fierce battle with six gunboats of the American invading forces on the sea southwest of Dahe Island. This was a naval ambush, and the gunboats of the Volunteer Army's naval defense unit achieved a glorious victory with fewer forces, sinking and damaging one enemy gunboat each, and blocking the enemy's reinforcement of the defenders on Dahe Island.
    Just after dark on November 30th last year, the two gunboats of our naval defense unit were ordered to depart early and head towards the southwest of Dahe Island.
    Our heavy artillery, covering the landing of our troops, had been bombarding for a long time. The two gunboats, tasked with the ambush mission, had already sailed far away from the coast.
    Soon, two signal flares rose into the dark sky over Dahe Island. This was the signal for the infantry landing. The artillery bombardment ceased, and faint sounds of gunfire came from the island.
    "Beware of enemy ships!" our observer on the gunboat warned. In an instant, the enemy gunboats, attempting to reinforce Dahe Island, fired flares, and then batches of shells landed near Dahe Island.
    "Don't let a single enemy shell fall on Dahe Island!" Our two gunboats quickly sailed towards the enemy gunboats, the distance closing. The enemy gunboats fired many flares into the sky above our gunboats, illuminating the sea and our gunboats. The light from the enemy's flares dazzled our gunners, making it difficult to see the enemy. Gunboat No. 2 immediately went full speed ahead, charging directly at the enemy gunboat and returning fire. This courageous action caught the enemy's attention. Gunboat No. 3 took advantage of this opportunity to calmly turn its bow and maneuvered to the left side of the enemy gunboat.
    "Get closer before firing!" Deputy Company Commander Zhu Xiwu ordered the gunners and sailors. When the gunboat sailed to within only 400 meters of the enemy gunboat, gunner You Junsheng immediately test-fired two shells. After his third shell hit the enemy gunboat, the gunners fired seven shells in a row. In the flash of the explosions, one of the enemy gunboats was hit and sank into the sea, and the remaining gunboat hurriedly turned and fled.
    After the first round of the naval ambush, the enemy was still not reconciled and sent four more gunboats, but the enemy's delusion was still shattered.
    The fire from the enemy gunboats was very fierce, and our two gunboats were hit one after another. The bow of Gunboat No. 3 was hit with a hole, and seawater poured in. The gunners and sailors on the ship immediately used cotton quilts and cotton-padded coats to block the hole, and scooped out the seawater from the cabin to restore the gunboat's balance and continue fighting. The bow and side of Gunboat No. 2 were hit. Communist Party member Liu Nan encouraged everyone, saying, "We must resolutely prevent the enemy's gunboats from reinforcing the enemy on Dahe Island." Ammunition handler Liang Jichang was wounded, so he lay diagonally on the deck, continuing to load shells into the gun chamber. The gunner calmly persisted in firing, and his second shell hit one of the enemy gunboats. This startled the enemy, who dared not fight any longer and hurriedly covered the damaged gunboat as it fled.
    When our two gunboats, having successfully completed their ambush mission at sea, triumphantly returned to Dahe Island, the enemy who had been stubbornly holding out on Dahe Island, awaiting reinforcements, had been completely annihilated by our landing troops.

    海上的阻击战
    新华社记者  谢芝麟
    在进击清川江以北诸岛屿的渡海作战中，中国人民志愿军某海防部队的两艘炮船曾在大和岛西南海面上，跟美国侵略军的六艘炮艇进行了一场激烈的战斗。这是海上的一个阻击战，志愿军的这支海防部队的炮船取得了以少胜多的光辉战果，将敌人的炮舰击沉击伤各一艘，阻击了敌人对大和岛上守敌的增援。
    去年十一月三十日天刚黑，我海防部队的两艘炮船奉命提前出发向大和岛西南方向开去。
    我们掩护部队登陆的重炮开始轰击好久了。这两艘担任阻击任务的炮船，已经开到离海岸很远的海面。
    不久在黑茫茫的大和岛上空，升起了两颗讯号弹。这是步兵登陆的讯号。炮击停止了，从岛上传来了隐隐约约的枪声。
    “注意有敌舰！”我们炮船上的观察员警告着。刹那间，企图增援大和岛的敌人炮艇上发出照明弹，接着炮弹就成批地落在大和岛附近。
    “不让敌人的一发炮弹落在大和岛上！”我们的两艘炮船迅速向敌人炮舰开去，距离越来越近。敌人的炮艇向我们炮船的上空打出很多照明弹，照亮了海面和我们的炮船，敌人炮艇上炮弹一发紧接着一发地打过来。在敌人打出的照明弹的光亮下，我们炮手们的眼被耀得看不见敌人。二号炮船立即开足了马力直向敌人的炮艇冲去，并向敌炮艇还击。这一勇猛的动作引起了敌人的注意。三号炮船趁着这个机会，便从容地掉转船头，向敌人炮艇的左侧迂回过去。
    “靠近点再打！”副连长朱希武这样地命令炮手们和船工。等炮船开到离敌人的炮艇仅四百米达处，炮手尤俊生立即试射了两发炮弹。在他第三发炮弹命中敌人炮艇后，炮手们就一连发出了七发炮弹。在爆炸的闪光中，敌人的一艘炮艇被击中而沉下海去，剩下的另一艘炮艇，急忙掉头逃跑了。
    海上阻击战的第一回合结束以后，敌人还不甘心，又开来了四艘炮艇，但是敌人的这个妄想仍然是破灭了。
    从敌人炮艇上发出的炮火很猛烈，我们的两艘炮船先后被击伤了。三号炮船的船头，被打了一个窟窿，海水从洞口涌进来。船上的炮手和船工们立即用棉被、棉大衣堵塞漏洞，又从船舱里舀出海水，使炮船恢复平衡，继续作战。二号炮船的船头和船舷被击伤了，共产党员刘南就鼓励大家说：“要坚决阻止敌人的炮艇来增援大和岛的敌人。”弹药手梁吉昌身上负了伤，他便斜卧在船板上，继续把炮弹填进炮膛。炮手就沉着地坚持发射，他打出的第二发炮弹就打中了敌人的一艘炮艇。这一下敌人发慌了，不敢再战，连忙掩护着被打伤的那艘炮艇逃跑了。
    当我们这两艘在海上完成了阻击战任务的炮船胜利驶返大和岛的时候，在大和岛上固守待援的敌人已被我们登陆的部队全部歼灭了。
