    Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government
    Circular on Early Prevention and Control of Locusts, Cotton Aphids, and Rice Stem Borers

    The winter climate last year was warmer than in previous years, and the mortality rate of overwintering rice stem borer larvae and cotton aphid eggs was not high. The density of locust egg distribution is also very high. There is a possibility of serious outbreaks of locusts, cotton aphids, and rice stem borers this year.

    According to a survey in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, in February, 99% of rice stubble contained rice stem borer larvae, and over 90% of these larvae did not die from freezing. Surveys in Cixi and Yin Counties in the Ningbo region showed an average of 1.5 to 2 rice stem borer larvae per rice root clump, with only 10% to 30% frozen to death (in previous years, at least 60% of overwintering rice stem borers would freeze to death).

    Zhu Hongfu, an entomology expert from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, recently investigated the overwintering cotton aphid eggs in cotton-growing areas of Shaanxi and Hebei. He found that the mortality rate of cotton aphid eggs parasitizing the roots of the main hosts, such as sow thistle and chickweed, was extremely low, and almost 100% safely survived the winter. Furthermore, due to the large area of cotton aphid occurrence last year, the number of overwintering aphid eggs found on the hosts was also much higher than in previous years.

    In areas of East China that suffered severe locust plagues last year, local people's governments and pest and disease prevention stations conducted locust egg inspections last winter. According to a survey of 43 villages in 7 districts of Sihong County, northern Anhui, more than 25,000 mu of land contained locust eggs, of which more than 5,500 mu had a high density, with 22 to 49 egg masses per square foot; more than 20,000 mu had a medium density, with 2 to 4 egg masses per square foot. According to surveys in areas near Weishan Lake in Shandong, the lake embankment about 20 li long and 1 to 2 li wide in the first and second districts of Pei County, and the lake beach of more than 250 square li in Tongbei County, universally contained locust eggs. Areas with high density had an average of 2 to 4 locust egg masses per square foot, and areas with low density had an average of 1 locust egg mass per 5 square feet.

    The above are surveys from only some areas, but they illustrate the general situation in all frequently occurring areas of rice stem borers, cotton aphids, and locusts. Leading organs in all regions should pay serious attention to this issue and organize the masses as soon as possible to take effective prevention and control measures.

### 中央人民政府农业部  关于及早防治蝗虫、棉蚜、稻螟虫的通报

    关于及早防治蝗虫、棉蚜、稻螟虫的通报
    去年冬季气候较比往年温暖，越冬的稻螟幼虫和棉蚜的卵死亡不多。蝗卵分布的密度也很大。今年蝗虫、棉蚜和稻螟都有严重发生的可能。
    据浙江省嘉兴县二月间调查，水稻禾蔸百分之九十九有三化螟幼虫，这些幼虫百分之九十以上未冻死。宁波专区慈溪县和鄞县调查，平均每丛稻根有一个半到两个稻螟幼虫，被冻死的仅百分之十到三十（往年稻螟越冬至少要冻死百分之六十）。
    中国科学院昆虫学专家朱弘复最近在陕西和河北棉区调查棉蚜过冬卵的情况，发现棉蚜的主要寄主苦荬菜、夏至草等根部寄生的棉蚜卵死亡极少，几乎百分之百安全地度过了冬季。并且由于去年棉蚜发生面积广大，在寄主上发现的过冬蚜卵的数目也比往年大大增加。
    华东去年遭受严重蝗害的地区，当地人民政府及病虫防治站在去年冬季曾进行了蝗卵的检查工作。据皖北泗洪县七个区四十三个村的调查，有二万五千多亩遗有蝗卵，其中密度较大的有五千五百亩，每方尺有二十二到四十九个卵块；密度中常的有二万多亩，每方尺有卵块两个到四个。据山东靠近微山湖地带的调查，沛县一、二区长约二十余华里、宽一至二华里的湖堤，以及铜北县二百五十余方里的湖滩内，普遍遗有蝗卵，密度大的地方平均每方尺有二至四块蝗卵，密度不大的地方平均每五方尺有一块蝗卵。
    以上虽是部分地区的调查，但却可说明所有螟虫、棉蚜和蝗虫经常发生地区的一般情况。各地领导机关应严重注意这一问题，及早组织群众，采取有效的防治措施。
