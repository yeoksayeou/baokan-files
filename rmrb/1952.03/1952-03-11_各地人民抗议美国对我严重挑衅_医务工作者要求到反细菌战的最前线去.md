Xinhua News Agency report: People across the country are furiously protesting the serious provocative acts of the American aggressors in spreading bacterial insects in Northeast China. Scientific workers and medical and health workers in various places have requested to go to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare.

People in various places have issued statements, held rallies, or written letters to local newspapers, expressing their determination to respond to the American aggressors with practical actions. The people of the Central-South, Northwest, and Southwest regions are determined to support the Volunteers and completely smash all the aggressive conspiracies of the American aggressors with the great victory of the anti-corruption, anti-embezzlement, and anti-bureaucracy movement. The Northwest branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association issued a statement saying: The people of the entire Northwest swear to counterattack the aggressors with greater strength. The People's Political Consultative Conference of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City, and the local organizations of various democratic parties in the Northwest, Shaanxi Province, and Xi'an City issued a joint statement, unanimously protesting the crime of American imperialism in frantically extending the flames of bacterial warfare to Northeast China. Zhao Shoushan, chairman of the Qinghai Provincial branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, called on the people of the province to continue to actively support the Chinese People's Volunteers. Maichengzhang, the Imam of the Hui Muslim Qingzhen Great Mosque in Xining, said:
"The American aggressors' crimes in attempting to destroy peace-loving people will surely bring them their own evil consequences." 27 million farmers in southern and northern Anhui are determined to do a good job in spring plowing and repairs, drought prevention and resistance, strive for a bumper harvest this year, and vigorously support the Volunteers. The people of Andong City, who witnessed American planes spreading bacteria, have been mobilized in a state of tension and have engaged in the battle to eliminate bacterial insects.

Experts in bacteriology, entomology, and other fields, and medical and health workers across the country, unanimously stated that they cannot tolerate the crimes of the American aggressors in spreading bacteria in Korea and Northeast China. They have expressed their desire to go to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare. Zhu Xianyi, chairman of the "Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committee" composed of medical workers in Tianjin, said: We medical workers in Tianjin must not sit idly by in the face of this inhumane attack by American imperialists. We have already formed a bacterial warfare defense organization, and hundreds of people have signed up to participate. We are determined to form an epidemic prevention team to go to Northeast China and Korea to eliminate the bacteria spread by the enemy. Doctors and nurses throughout the Tianjin No. 3 Hospital wrote letters of determination, unanimously requesting to join the battlefield epidemic prevention team. In one afternoon on the 7th, 103 people submitted their letters of determination to the union. In Guangzhou, 50 medical, health, and scientific workers requested to go to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare. In addition, Gong Weizheng and 26 other doctors from the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital who had participated in the Resist America, Aid Korea medical team, Lin Junhua and 10 other doctors who had participated in the Chinese Red Cross International Medical Epidemic Prevention Team, and Zhang Jianchuan, director of the Guangzhou Red Cross Hospital, also expressed their determination to participate in the anti-bacterial warfare. Liu Zhongtang, the captain of the sixth team of the Guangzhou Resist America, Aid Korea Volunteer Medical Surgical Team, and team member Xie Tianyi and five others, who had gloriously completed their mission and returned not long ago, wrote to the Guangzhou United News Agency, requesting to go to Korea again. Students from a midwifery school in Jiangxi Province have requested that the school add courses on the defense against bacterial warfare, so that they can participate in the work of eliminating bacteria as soon as possible. Medical workers in Jinan City, Shandong Province, held an emergency meeting on the 9th and decided to organize a Resist America, Aid Korea Bacterial Elimination and Epidemic Prevention Brigade and a Jinan Epidemic Prevention Work Team. More than 1,000 professors, doctors, and students from the International East China Peace Hospital, Shandong Provincial Hospital, and Bethune Medical College requested to go to the front lines of the anti-bacterial warfare. Medical and health workers in the Southern Jiangsu region warmly responded to the call of the Chinese Medical Association and requested to go to Korea. 388 people from Jiangsu Medical College alone signed up. Wuhu City enthusiastically launched a signature campaign to volunteer to join the epidemic prevention and inspection team. In the four days from the 3rd to the 6th, 427 doctors, nurses, and other personnel from the Southern Anhui Medical Epidemic Prevention Brigade, the Southern Anhui Health Technology School and its affiliated cadre training class, and the affiliated hospital signed their names. They firmly stated that they would respond to the call of the motherland at any time and go to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare to work. All the staff of the Health Laboratory of the Southern and Northern Anhui Administrative Office Health Department used their lunch break to study epidemic prevention and inspection. Medical workers in Xi'an City have established a special committee for bacterial warfare defense. More than 1,000 health workers from Baoji and Xianyang in Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City have registered to go to Korea to participate in epidemic prevention work and have donated a large number of epidemic prevention medicines and equipment. More than half of the students at Northwest Medical College wrote letters of determination requesting to go to Korea to eliminate bacteria. Chen Wengui, director of the Chongqing Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committee and a famous bacteriologist, told reporters: "I express extreme indignation at the atrocities of the American aggressors. I want to completely contribute all my knowledge and experience in bacteriology and epidemic prevention to do a good job in this epidemic prevention work." Health workers in Chongqing have actively signed up to participate in the volunteer aid Korea epidemic prevention work team. By the 7th, more than 1,500 people had registered. They are also actively carrying out mass propaganda work against bacterial warfare. Under the unified leadership of the Chongqing Bacterial Warfare Defense Committee, they adopted various methods to publicize the crimes of bacterial warfare and how to defend against bacterial warfare to the people of the city. The Chongqing Bacterial Warfare Defense Committee has drawn many cartoons and comic strips related to bacterial defense and written many slogans, and produced slides, which are distributed to various cinemas and slide projection teams for screening.

The crimes of the American aggressors in spreading bacteria have also angered the people and medical and health workers in the border areas of ethnic minorities in our country. The Medical Workers Association of the Tibetan Autonomous Region and the medical workers of various ethnic groups in the Kangding Central Health Hospital held a forum, expressing their willingness to be ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland and dedicate themselves to the struggle to stop the bacterial warfare of the American aggressors. All 100 members of the Central Ethnic Health Work Team working in Kangding jointly issued a protest letter, expressing their willingness to dedicate themselves to the forefront of the struggle to eliminate bacteria.
