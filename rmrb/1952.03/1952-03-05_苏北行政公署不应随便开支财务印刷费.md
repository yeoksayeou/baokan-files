    The Finance Printing Expenses of the Sub North Administrative Office Should Not Be Casually Disbursed
    Editor: Recently, the Finance Department of the Sub North Administrative Office discovered the behavior of embezzling finance printing expenses and violating financial discipline during inspection work. According to regulations, finance printing expenses are used for printing forms, account books, and other expenses by the financial departments, but the Sub North Administrative Office does not follow the special-purpose regulations of the higher authorities and casually disburses them. For example, last year, the Sub North Administrative Office used more than 14.7 million yuan to buy and send local products such as shrimp, dried shrimp, fish skin, fish maw, and fermented liquor to various provinces and regions and the East China Bureau. It used 142.2 million yuan to buy an English typewriter and 295.5 million yuan to buy bicycles. Even the director of the Finance Department used printing expenses to cover the purchase of wine, briefcases, travel bags, etc. As for other relatively large expenses that cannot be reimbursed, it is even more common to embezzle printing expenses to make up for them, thus causing a lot of unnecessary waste. I suggest that relevant departments conduct a thorough investigation as soon as possible.

    苏北行政公署不应随便开支财务印刷费
    编辑同志：最近苏北行政公署财政处在检查工作中，发现有挪用财务印刷费，违反财政纪律的行为。按规定，财务印刷费是用作财政部门印刷表格、账册等开支的，但苏北行政公署却不遵照上级专款专用规定，随便开支。如去年苏北行政公署买送各省区和华东局的土产虾子、虾米、鱼皮、鱼肚、曲酒等，就动用了一千四百七十多万元，买英文打字机动用了一亿四千二百多万元，买脚踏车动用了二亿九千五百多万元；甚至财务处处长购买酒、公文包、旅行包等，也是挪用印刷费来开支的。至于其他比较巨大而无法报销的开支，挪用印刷费来弥补更是常有的事，因而造成了很多不应有的浪费。我建议有关部门速作深入的检查。
