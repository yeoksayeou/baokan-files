    Is it "Teaching" or "Doing Business"?
    Bai Sheng
    In our universities, there are people who, though called "professors" or "experts," are in reality "three parts teaching, seven parts business." In their eyes, the school is like a "store," an "office," or a "training workshop." They often spread bourgeois ideas among students and colleagues, saying things like "You can live a comfortable life if you earn money," "Money is omnipotent," and so on. They are very interested in "business acumen": they talk about it in the teachers' lounge, they talk about it in the classroom, as if there is nothing else to talk about. They also try to turn colleagues and students into their "partners" and "assistants."
    The head of the Telecommunications Department of a certain school says to wealthy colleagues, "You can make a lot of money by doing business. You provide the capital, and I have the connections." To professors without money, he says, "Let's do business together. You have the technology, and I have the way." He doesn't just say it, he does it. He doesn't care whether students need such instruments for experiments, or whether the instruments are good or bad. He buys them all and then resells them to the school to "make a lot of money." No wonder people call this department "So-and-so's Electrical Materials Store."
    Some are busy opening "offices" outside, and some are busy opening shops to do business, so that they don't have enough time to allocate. So they adopt a "rotating power outage" method: today, this class is canceled; tomorrow, that class is canceled; this week, this class is canceled; next week, that class is canceled.
    Still others, wearing the guise of "professors," "university lecturers," and "technical experts," often collude with unscrupulous merchants outside, acting as "technical consultants" for capitalists. Such "professors" and "lecturers" who are solely after profit and become greedy at the sight of money do not care about teaching at all; they only know how to find ways to make money. "What good is reputation or morality? Money can get you anywhere," that is their belief.
    Today, our motherland urgently needs a large number of construction talents, but some of our university teachers treat their teaching work with such a bad attitude. It is not difficult for people to imagine what kind of place they want to turn our universities into. Can this phenomenon be tolerated?

### 是“教学”还是“经商”呢？

    是“教学”还是“经商”呢？
    柏生
    在我们的高等学校里，有这样一种人，他们虽然也被称做“教授”“专家”之类，但实际上是“三分教学，七分经商”。在他们的眼里，学校就好像是“商店”、“事务所”、“学徒训练班”一样。他们经常在同学和同事中间散布着资产阶级的思想，说什么“赚了钱就能过舒适生活”、“金钱万能”，等等。他们对“生意经”感到很大的兴趣：在教员休息室里谈，在教室里也谈，似乎除此以外再也没有可说的了。他们还企图把同事、同学都变成他们的“伙伴”和“助手”。
    某校电信系系主任，见到有钱的同事就说：“作买卖赚大钱，你掏本钱，我有办法。”对没钱的教授则说：“咱们作买卖吧，你有技术，我有路子。”他不只是这样说，而且这样做。他不管学生的实验是否需要这样的仪器，也不管仪器是好是坏，统通收买进来，再转手卖给学校，“赚大钱”。这就难怪人们要把这个系叫做“×记电料行”了。
    也有的忙着在外面开“事务所”，有的忙着在外面开商店做生意，以致时间不够分配，于是采取了“轮流停电”的办法：今天停这班课，明天停那班课，这个星期停这班课，下个星期停那班课。
    还有的披着“教授”、“大学讲师”、“技术专家”的外衣，经常在外面和奸商勾结，做着资本家的“技术顾问”。像这样唯利是图、见钱眼开的“教授”、“讲师”，对教书是根本不关心的，他们只知道专门寻找赚钱的门径。“什么名誉道德，有钱就吃得开”，这就是他们的信念。
    今天，我们的祖国正迫切需要着大量的建设人才，而我们的某些高等学校教师却以那样恶劣的态度对待自己的教学工作。人们不难想像到，他们要把我们的高等学校变成什么样的地方。这种现象难道是可以容忍的吗？
