A Brief Commentary on Cultural Life

    The Glory of the Chinese People's Literary Undertaking
    It is a matter for celebration that the famous literary works of Chinese writers Ding Ling, Zhou Libo, He Jingzhi, and Ding Yi have won the 1951 Stalin Prize. This is the glory of the Chinese people's literary undertaking and a great victory for Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line. Among the literary and artistic works awarded the Stalin Prize by the Soviet Council of Ministers this time, there are some outstanding foreign literary and artistic works, which is unprecedented in previous Stalin Prizes. This shows the socialist Soviet Union's emphasis on world progressive literature and art and its great concern for the literary undertakings of fraternal countries, proving that Stalin's country and people not only love their own literature and art, but also respect all progressive literature and art of other nations. This emphasis and care gives the workers of the people's literature and art a great encouragement.
    The reason why the works of Chinese writers Ding Ling, Zhou Libo, and others can win the Stalin Prize is because these works faithfully practice Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line, and profoundly and vividly reflect the important struggles and victories of the Chinese people for their own liberation. Therefore, these works are not only welcomed by Chinese readers and audiences, but also widely praised by Soviet readers and audiences, and finally won great honor. Chinese literary and artistic workers should be proud of this, and encourage themselves to resolutely and correctly practice Mao Zedong's literary and artistic direction, go deep into the lives of the masses' struggles, and deeply understand the masses, so as to correctly, vividly, and emotionally reflect the heroic struggles of the Chinese people, thereby not only educating the Chinese people, but also having a positive impact on readers around the world. The more a work is for the Chinese people, the more world significance it has. This is a truth that has been proven by facts.
    Not long ago, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles organized a group of writers to go to the Korean front line, to factories and rural areas, and to participate in the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle, to deeply experience the lives of the masses' struggles, transform their thinking, and engage in creation. This is very necessary and completely correct. This measure has been supported by the broad masses. We hope that more literary and artistic workers will continue to go deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, so as to obtain the most valuable creative materials from the people's lives, produce works that are loved by the Chinese people and readers around the world, and make our literary and artistic undertakings achieve greater success.

    中国人民文学事业的光荣
    我国作家丁玲、周立波、贺敬之、丁毅的著名文学作品荣获一九五一年斯大林奖金，是一件值得庆贺的事情。这是中国人民文学事业的光荣，也是毛泽东文艺路线的巨大胜利。这次荣膺苏联部长会议颁发的斯大林奖金的文艺作品中，包括了一部分外国的优秀文艺作品，这是历届斯大林奖金中所没有的。它说明了社会主义的苏联对世界进步文学艺术的重视和对兄弟国家人民文学事业的极大关怀，证明了斯大林的国家和人民，不但热爱他们自己的文学艺术，也尊重其他民族的一切进步的文学艺术。这种重视和关怀，给了人民的文学艺术工作者以莫大的鼓舞。
    中国作家丁玲、周立波等的作品所以能荣膺斯大林奖金，是因为这些作品忠实地实践了毛泽东的文艺路线，深刻地、生动地反映了中国人民为了自己的解放而进行的重要的斗争和胜利。因此，这些作品不但受到中国读者和观众的欢迎，而且也受到苏联读者和观众的普遍赞扬，终于获得了极大的荣誉。中国的文艺工作者们，应该以此为荣，并策励自己，坚决、正确地实践毛泽东的文艺方向，深入到群众斗争生活中去，深刻地了解群众，才能正确地、生动地、并且情绪饱满地反映出中国人民英勇斗争的事迹，从而不仅教育中国人民，并且在世界读者中发生积极的影响。愈是为中国人民的作品，就愈有世界意义。——这是为事实所证明了的真理。
    不久以前，中华全国文学艺术界联合会已组织一批作家赴朝鲜前线，到工厂农村，以及投入反贪污、反盗窃斗争中去，深入体验群众斗争生活，改造思想，从事创作，这是十分必要和完全正确的，这一措施，得到了广大群众的拥护。我们希望还有更多的文艺工作者将继续深入工农兵群众中去，以便从人民生活中取得最可宝贵的创作原料，产生出为中国人民和世界读者所喜爱的作品，使我们的文学艺术事业获得更大的成就。
