    Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democracies
    Literature and Art of Fighting Vietnam
    In the struggle against the French imperialist aggressors, the literature and art of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam plays a very important role in educating and mobilizing the Vietnamese people.

    Vietnamese writers and artists underwent severe tests and training in the flames of the Second World War against Japanese imperialism, and grew up in the battles. Composer Van Cao's famous "March Forward Song," composed during World War II, has become the national anthem of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Later, Nguyen Dinh Thi created "Eliminate Fascism!", and Du Nhuan created "Guerrilla Army" and other famous folk songs. At first, these songs were only secretly popular, but after the August Revolution of 1945, these magnificent revolutionary songs immediately resounded throughout the young republic.

    At the end of 1946, under the direction of its American masters, French imperialism blatantly tore up the agreements it had signed with the Vietnamese government and launched a large-scale offensive against the Vietnamese people. Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people carried out a heroic armed struggle against the French aggressors.

    During that critical period, the finest writers and artists of Vietnam resolutely stood on the side of the people and engaged in a heroic struggle against French imperialism. Drama troupes and singing teams were active in the countryside, encouraging and strengthening the confidence of guerrillas and people's army soldiers in resisting the French imperialist aggressors.

    Many writers, poets, artists, and actors joined the People's Army. Many outstanding literary and art workers gloriously sacrificed their lives in battle. Among the martyrs who are forever remembered by the Vietnamese people are the painter To Ngoc Van, the writers Trinh Huu, Tran Dang, Tham Tam, and the poet Nguyen Dinh Ru, and other literary and artistic warriors.

    In July 1948, Vietnam held a national cultural conference, attended by scientists, artists, and educators. Later, a conference of writers and artists was held, and the Vietnam Literature and Arts Association (equivalent to the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles) was established, and the journal "Van Nghe" (Literature and Art) was published.

    The Vietnam Literature and Arts Association uses its great strength to develop the literature and art of the young republic, advocates the creative principles of socialist realism, and opposes the decadent and formalistic bad influences of Western bourgeois art.

    Writers, artists, and musicians take the fighting life of the masses of the people as the source of their creation, and choose the heroic deeds of the people in battle and production as the themes of their works. In their works, they spread the lofty ideals of peace and democracy, and encourage the Vietnamese people's confidence in finally defeating imperialist aggression.

    In order to experience the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, many literary and art workers participated in the actual struggle. Composer Van Chung created the song "March to Dong Khe" for the People's Army soldiers and battlefield workers. Young writer Kim Lan (deputy editor of "Van Nghe" magazine) created the short story "Village," which describes the life of Vietnamese peasants after liberation. The works of painter Nguyen Van Ty vividly depict the heroic deeds of battlefield workers. These literary and artistic works, closely integrated with the people's struggle and life, have been welcomed and loved by the broad masses of the people.

    Vietnamese writers pay great attention to introducing and learning from Soviet socialist literature. The famous writers Phan Khoi and Ngo Tat To have translated many works by Soviet writers into Vietnamese, so that the masses of the people can understand Soviet literature and the life of the Soviet people.

    In order to improve their work so as to better reflect the living reality of the masses of the people, writers, artists, actors, musicians and composers often gather to discuss the achievements and shortcomings of their work and works; they also often organize mass gatherings in factories and rural areas to listen to the opinions of workers and peasants on novels, plays, poems and songs.

    President Ho Chi Minh's guidance on literary and artistic workers has played a decisive role in improving the ideological and artistic quality of literary and artistic works.

    The Vietnam Literature and Arts Association pays great attention to training literary and art cadres. Literary and art schools have been widely established in various liberated areas. The Fourth Inter-zone has opened four music schools with 700 students from schools, troops and factories participating in the study. The Third Inter-zone has opened three music schools, three drama schools, one art school and one literature school. Now every village, every guerrilla unit, and every regimental headquarters of the People's Army has its own literary and art work troupe.

    The People's Literature and Art School, which opened in 1950, had 234 students in the first semester, 154 of whom came from the troops, and 48 were recommended by mass organizations. The famous writer Nguyen Hong leads this school. The school offers courses in literature, painting, music, and drama. With the collective efforts of teachers and students, some successful works have now been created. Among them, the two plays "Young Liaison Officer" and "Agricultural Tax" are the most popular.

    With the victorious development of the Vietnamese people's war against French imperialism, Vietnamese literature and art is also developing rapidly. The policy of "Literature and Art Serving the Resistance" is being further implemented. Vietnamese writers, artists, and all literary and art workers contribute all their energy, talent, and wisdom to the revolutionary cause of the Vietnamese people. They use their works to encourage the people and advance together with them. Their struggle for the complete independence and liberation of Vietnam and world peace and democracy will surely achieve the final and complete victory.

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活
    战斗越南的文学和艺术
    在反对法帝国主义侵略者的斗争中，越南民主共和国的文学和艺术在教育与动员越南人民方面，起着十分重要的作用。
    越南的作家和艺术家在第二次世界大战反对日本帝国主义的战火中，经受了严重的考验和锻炼，并在战斗中成长起来。作曲家文高在第二次世界大战中创作的著名的“进军歌”，已成为越南民主共和国的国歌。其后，阮廷诗又创作了“消灭法西斯！”，杜润又创作了“游击军”等著名的民歌。起初，这些歌曲还只是秘密地流行着，但在一九四五年八月革命以后，这些雄壮的革命的歌声，立即响彻了整个年青的共和国。
    一九四六年底，法帝国主义在它的美国主子的指使下，悍然撕毁它与越南政府签订的协定，向越南人民大举进攻。越南人民在胡志明主席的领导下，向法国侵略者进行了英勇的武装斗争。
    在那个严重的时期里，越南最优秀的作家和艺术家，坚决地站到人民这一边来，和法帝国主义进行英勇的斗争。演剧队和歌咏队活跃在乡间，鼓舞了并且坚定了游击队和人民军战士们抗击法帝国主义侵略者的信心。
    许多作家、诗人、艺术家和演员参加了人民军。许多优秀的文艺工作者在战斗中光荣地牺牲了。现在被越南人民所永远怀念着的牺牲者中间，有画家苏篱、作家崔友、陈登、深心和诗人阮廷书等文艺战士。
    一九四八年七月，越南举行了全国文化会议，参加者有科学家、艺术家和教育家。后来又召开了作家和艺术家的会议，成立了越南文艺会（相当于我国的全国文联），出版了机关刊物“文艺”。
    越南文艺会以极大的力量来发展年青的共和国的文学艺术，提倡社会主义现实主义的创作原则，反对西方资产阶级艺术的那种腐朽颓废的和形式主义的恶劣影响。
    作家、艺术家和音乐家以人民群众的战斗生活，作为自己的创作泉源，选择人民在战斗与生产中的英勇事迹，作为自己的作品的题材。他们在作品中传播和平和民主的崇高理想，鼓舞着越南人民最后战胜帝国主义侵略的信心。
    为了体验工人、农民和战士的生活，许多文艺工作者参加了实际斗争。作曲家文终为人民军战士与战地工作者创作了“进军东溪”的歌曲。青年作家金麟（“文艺”刊物的副编辑），创作了描写解放后的越南农民生活的短篇小说“乡村”。画家阮文创的作品，生动地描绘了战地工作者的英勇事迹。这些紧密地结合着人民的斗争和生活的文艺作品，受到了广大人民的欢迎和热爱。
    越南的作家们十分注意介绍和学习苏联的社会主义文学，著名的作家潘魁和吴必素，把许多苏联作家的作品译成越南文，使人民群众能够认识苏联的文学和苏联人民的生活。
    为了改进自己的工作，以便更好地反映人民群众的生活现实，作家、艺术家、演员、音乐家与作曲家时常集会，讨论自己的工作、作品的成就与缺点；他们也经常在工厂中与农村里组织群众集会，听取工人和农民对于小说、剧本、诗歌和歌曲的意见。
    胡志明主席关于文学艺术工作者的指导，对于提高文艺作品的思想性和艺术性，起了决定性的作用。
    越南文艺会非常注意培养文艺工作干部。文艺学校在解放区各地普遍地设立起来。第四联区已开办了四个音乐学校，参加学习的有来自学校、部队和工厂的七百个学员。第三联区已开办了三个音乐学校、三个戏剧学校、一个艺术学校和一个文学学校。现在每一个农村，每一支游击队和人民军部队的每一个团部里，都有它自己的文艺工作团。
    在一九五○年开办的人民文艺学校，第一学期就有学员二百三十四名，其中一百五十四名来自部队，四十八名是由群众团体推荐来的，名作家元红领导这个学校。学校设有文学、绘画、音乐和戏剧等课程。在师生的集体努力之下，现在已创作了一些成功的作品。其中“小联络员”和“农业税”两个剧本最受欢迎。
    随着越南人民反法帝国主义战争的胜利发展，越南的文学和艺术也日益迅速地发展起来。“文艺为抗战服务”的方针，正在进一步贯彻着。越南的作家、艺术家和一切文艺工作者，以他们的全部精力、才能和智慧、贡献给越南人民的革命事业，他们用自己的作品来鼓舞人民并和他们一起前进。他们为越南的完全独立解放和世界和平民主而进行的斗争，一定会取得最后的彻底的胜利。（本文主要取材于文丁所作“战斗越南的文学和艺术”一文，原载一九五一年第五十期“新时代”）
