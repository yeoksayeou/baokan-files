    Shen Junru Sends a Telegram to the International Association of Democratic Lawyers
    Calling for a Halt to the Bacteriological Warfare by the American Aggressors

    [Xinhua News Agency, March 13th] Shen Junru, Vice-President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, sent a telegram to the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, calling for effective measures to stop the heinous crime of bacteriological warfare by the American aggressors. The text of the telegram is as follows:
    To Mr. Nordmann, Secretary-General of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, Paris,
    And to Mr. Pritt, President:
    Since January 28th of this year, the American invading army has continuously used military aircraft to spread large quantities of insects carrying plague, cholera, and other infectious bacteria over the front lines and rear areas of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. From February 29th to March 5th of this year, the area of bacteriological warfare was further expanded to Chinese territory. Military aircraft intruded into the airspace of Northeast China in 68 batches, 448 sorties in total, and scattered large numbers of bacteria-carrying insects in Fushun, Xinmin, Andong, Kuandian, Linjiang, and other places, and bombed and strafed the Linjiang and Changdian River areas.

    The American aggressors are engaged in bacteriological warfare in a planned manner. In 1925, the majority of countries in the world signed the Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons, but the United States, like Japan, did not ratify it. This shows that they had the conspiracy and determination to use such weapons at that time. After the end of World War II, the American aggressors also raised a large number of Japanese bacteriological war criminals, such as Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano, and spent huge sums of money every year to engage in the research and manufacture of bacteriological weapons. They even used captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons. Now it is actually carrying out large-scale slaughter of the Korean and Chinese people's fighting forces and the peace-loving people of Korea and China with bacteriological weapons.

    This frenzied, shameless and extremely barbaric behavior of the American aggressors violates international law, especially the Geneva Protocol, violates the resolution of the Warsaw Conference of the World Peace Congress prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons, and also violates the lowest standards of human morality. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government, has issued solemn statements twice, on February 24th and March 8th, respectively. In order to defend world peace and human security, to maintain the above-mentioned Warsaw Conference resolution and international law prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons, and in the hope that democratic legal scholars and all peace-loving people around the world will unite and stop this heinous crime of the American aggressors; I, on behalf of the China Political Science and Law Association, and in the capacity of Vice-President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, appeal to you, earnestly hoping that the International Association of Democratic Lawyers will take effective measures to stop it, and mobilize national branches and democratic legal scholars around the world to make a unified and just condemnation.

    沈钧儒致电国际民主法律工作者协会
    呼吁制止美国侵略者进行细菌战
    【新华社十三日讯】国际民主法律工作者协会副主席沈钧儒致电国际民主法律工作者协会，呼吁采取有效措施，制止美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行，电文如下：巴黎国际民主法律工作者协会总书记诺德曼先生
    并转主席普里特先生：
    美国侵略军自本年一月二十八日起，连续以军用飞机在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的前线和后方，大批撒布各类负荷鼠疫、霍乱及其他传染病菌的昆虫。自本年二月二十九日至三月五日，更把细菌战的区域扩大到中国领土，先后以军用飞机六十八批，四百四十八架次，侵入我国东北领空，在抚顺、新民、安东、宽甸、临江等地撒布大量负荷细菌的昆虫，并对临江、长甸河口地区进行轰炸扫射。
    美国侵略者是有计划地从事细菌战的。一九二五年全世界大多数国家签订了禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书，但是美国和日本一样，并未予以批准。可见早在那时它们已有使用这种武器的阴谋和决心。第二次世界大战结束后，美国侵略者又豢养了大批日本细菌战犯，石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏等，并每年花费巨大款项，以从事于细菌武器的研究和制造。曾以朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员作为细菌武器的实验品。现在它竟实行以细菌武器来大规模屠杀朝中人民作战部队与朝中和平人民。
    美国侵略者的这种疯狂、无耻和极端野蛮的行为，违反了国际公法，特别是日内瓦议定书，违反了世界保卫和平大会华沙会议通过的禁止使用细菌武器的决议，也违反了最低标准的人类道德。我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长已在二月二十四日及三月八日先后两次发表严正声明。为了保卫世界和平与人类安全，为了维护禁止使用细菌武器的上述华沙会议决议和国际公法，为了希望全世界的民主法学者和一切爱好和平的人民，一致动员起来，制止美国侵略者的这种滔天罪行；我代表中国政治法律学会，并以国际民主法律工作者协会副主席的资格，向你提出呼吁，切望国际民主法律工作者协会，采取有效制止的措施，并发动各国分会及全世界民主法学者，一致作正义的声讨。
    沈钧儒
    一九五二年三月十三日于北京
