Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 15th: According to a TASS report from Moscow on March 14th, the laboring people of Moscow held a grand rally on March 13th to protest against the use of bacteriological weapons by American imperialism in Korea and China. Muscovites unanimously expressed their support for the protests lodged by the governments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China against this grave new crime by the U.S. government.

    The meeting was opened by Academician Grekov, a renowned Soviet historian and Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Committee for the Defense of Peace. He stated that countless people around the world, after reading the statements by Park Heon-yeong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and learning that American imperialists had dropped bacteriological bombs on the front and rear of Korea, and within Northeast China, felt boundless anger.

    Even the Hitlerite aggressors did not dare to use bacteriological weapons. But now, American imperialists are committing crimes unprecedented in history.

    Grekov pointed out that the Second World Peace Congress held in Warsaw had demanded the unconditional prohibition of all kinds of atomic, bacteriological, and chemical weapons, as well as all poisons, radioactive materials, and other means of mass destruction of humanity. The Congress had also demanded that the first country to use these weapons must be declared a war criminal. However, the U.S. government was unwilling to heed this warning from the people.

    Academician Grekov then pointed out that U.S. Secretary of State Acheson had recently telegraphed the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva, flatly denying the accusations that the United States and the United Nations forces were conducting germ warfare in North Korea and suggesting an "investigation" into these accusations.

    Acheson emphasized that the "investigation" should be conducted simultaneously in both North and South Korea, but he made no mention of China at all. However, according to the statement by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, everyone knows that recently, American aircraft have not only been conducting germ warfare in Korea, but have also expanded this activity to Northeast China, where they have dropped flies and fleas carrying plague, cholera, and typhoid germs.

    Grekov Exposes Acheson's Dare Not Oppose Germ Warfare, Conspiring to Cover Up Shameful Crimes of Spreading Germs

    Academician Grekov continued, Acheson had to take this statement seriously because the anger of the people of Asia and Europe, and even the people of the United States itself, against the American use of bacteriological weapons was growing higher and higher, and the affected strata were becoming wider and wider.

    Acheson's suggestion of an "investigation" is nothing more than an attempt to dodge and hide. He apparently believes that there are people within the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva who will carry out his every command; or he believes that empty talk of an "investigation" can at least help to divert public attention and conceal the shameful facts that Acheson's underlings are spreading plague, cholera, typhoid, and other germs on an increasingly large scale in Korea and China. These people have American planes at their disposal, which can fly over Korea and northern China at night.

    Grekov also said: The most noteworthy thing is that Acheson has already denied for the second time that American troops in Korea have used bacteriological weapons, but he has not uttered a single word about the fact that the use of bacteriological weapons is unacceptable. He remains silent on this point. Obviously, he not only does not oppose germ warfare, but he is also an ardent advocate of this shameless, heinous, and inhumane warfare.

    In the United States, many people like to talk about the expansion of war budgets, the increase in military strength, and the preparations for new wars at press conferences and official meetings. Recently, several official representatives of the U.S. government, including General Rooks, General Cleesy, and others, have published lengthy reports on their preparations for large-scale germ warfare. These officials have all talked at length about the necessity of germ warfare. If this is the case, how can they advocate condemning germ warfare? When they are caught red-handed using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, is it not obvious that they can only remain silent or try to deny it? They are unable to condemn the germ warfare being waged in Korea and China. They do not talk about this, they evade it, they attempt to organize some kind of "investigation" with the help of their hired agents to cover up their crimes.

    The people of the world, the honest people of all countries, must rise up to condemn these war criminals who are using an unjust weapon and waging germ warfare.

    As long as Acheson still does not dare to condemn germ warfare—no matter where it is being waged, whether in Korea, in China, or in any other place—as long as Acheson does not dare to do so, all honest people will consider him to be an advocate of this unjust and inhumane war.

    Academician Grekov concluded: We are convinced that the World Peace Council will take all necessary measures to protect humanity from the threat of germ warfare and other means of mass destruction.

    At the meeting, many scientists, workers, and intellectuals spoke one after another, expressing the thoughts and feelings of millions of Soviet people. They unanimously condemned the shamefulness of the American aggressors, whose hands are stained with the blood of women, children, and the elderly, and firmly protested against the U.S. government's use of bacteriological weapons.

    Zhukov-Verezhnikov, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, reiterated the Soviet Union's trial in Khabarovsk of twelve former Japanese military personnel who were found guilty of manufacturing and using bacteriological weapons. He said that the verdict was a serious warning to all imperialists and their accomplices. However, the American imperialists have become so mad that they dared to shield a major Japanese war criminal at that time—the bacteriologist Shiro Ishii, who oversaw the production of bacteriological weapons used against China. American imperialists openly used Ishii Shiro to prepare for new heinous crimes.

    Now, American imperialists have launched bacteriological attacks on Korea. By doing so, they have seriously violated international treaties on the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons.

    Zhukov-Verezhnikov continued: Soviet scientists express their angry protest against these evil acts of American imperialists. Soviet scientists firmly believe that the forces of peace are much stronger than the forces of war.

    Next, Berlov, foreman of the "Red Proletarian Factory," spoke. He said: I, a Soviet worker, accuse the American murderers of crimes against peace, against conscience, and against all mankind. I accuse the American adventurers, headed by Truman, of violating basic international law. I accuse the American imperialists, the instigators of all these crimes. The people of the world—French and Germans, British and Americans, Dutch and Swedes, Indians and Japanese, all honest people of the world—will raise their voices of protest. This gang of murderers, this gang of criminals, will certainly be punished.

    Academician Skobeltsyn Points Out Soviet Scientists and Progressive Humanity Protest Heinous Crimes of American Cannibals

    Academician Skobeltsyn, Chairman of the Stalin International Peace Prize Committee "For Strengthening Peace Among Nations," said: The responsibility for launching germ warfare lies not only with the American imperialists, but also with their accomplices who participate in this crime—American scientists, who have disgraced the glorious and noble title of scientist. They have turned the science of life—biology—into the science of death. The goals and principles of scientific development, at any time and in any place, should originally be constructive, creative, and life-giving. This is the case with science in countries where socialism has triumphed, where scientists are victoriously solving the various problems of extending human life and are studying the most effective ways to eliminate human diseases and suffering. However, the so-called scientists of America have deviated from these humanitarian principles and goals.

    Skobeltsyn said: Soviet scientists, together with all progressive humanity, protest against the heinous crimes of these American cannibals—these beasts that threaten the people of the whole world.

    The writer Ehrenburg delivered a moving speech. Ehrenburg said: At the end of January, General Cleesy, chief of the Research and Development Division of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, greatly praised germ warfare, saying, "I believe that the weapons we are studying can enable us to weaken the enemy's resistance at the least cost, thereby achieving victory without destroying its economy… Unlike atomic bombs or other explosive weapons, biological weapons are mainly aimed at people, because these weapons do not destroy buildings and machines, but are used against people themselves or people's food—livestock and grains." Soon after, the United States decided to test General Cleesy's "research and development" in Korea and China.

    Writer Ehrenburg Says Soviet People Demand an End to Germ Warfare and Firmly Advocate Severely Punishing Germ War Criminals

    Is it necessary to say that germ warfare is inhumane? General Cleesy seems to be a merchant who sells death and spreads infectious diseases. He says that plague, cholera, or typhoid is cheaper than bombs. He estimates the use of "the least cost." He emphasizes that if people get sick and die, factories and houses will remain intact and fall into the hands of the victors. This is truly insane, this is truly appalling. Are General Cleesy and those who are spreading germ-carrying insects still human? Their current behavior is extremely heinous and extremely stupid. They realize that they cannot win, so they resort to outrageous and despicable acts of revenge. All mankind despises them. They should no longer think of gaining the support of the people. What else do they have? Insects? But germ-carrying fleas cannot support them for long.

    Ehrenburg continued, we, the peaceful citizens of Moscow, demand an immediate end to germ warfare, and we firmly advocate punishing the criminals. We demand this not only because we are indignant at the aggressors' actions and their malicious desire to conquer the free people of Asia, but also because we respect Pasteur and despise the pseudo-scientists who cultivate germs, because we hope to save the people of all continents and countries from new catastrophes. We are not against the American people, we are against typhoid, against cholera, against plague, against those who cultivate typhoid, cholera, and plague. We want to defend what is most valuable—human life.

    The next speaker was Menshikova, a worker at the Three Hills Textile Factory. She emphasized that the American aggressors' use of bacteriological weapons is not proof of the enemy's strength, but proof of their cowardice and desperation. This enemy is even more cruel and despicable than the Hitlerite fascist bandits. We, the men and women workers, engineers, technicians, and staff of the Three Hills Textile Factory, like all the hundreds of millions of Soviet people, firmly protest against the evil actions of these enemies of mankind. All the staff of our factory have instructed me to demand that the World Peace Council immediately take the necessary measures to stop the mass slaughter of people by bacteriological weapons.

    Nikolai, Member of the Soviet Peace Committee, Archbishop of the Kolomna and Krutitsy Dioceses, said: The Russian Orthodox Church and one of its priests—myself, along with all the Soviet people and all peace-loving progressive humanity, protest indignantly against this crime! Those who launched germ warfare in Korea often cite the Bible in their speeches in their own country, insisting that they intend to "defend Christian civilization," calling themselves Christians. This is the greatest blasphemy for every person who truly believes in Christian doctrine. These hypocrites call themselves Christians. These hypocrites are not Christians. They are not human. They have no conscience, no compassion. They have no sense of responsibility for their evil crimes.

    Other speakers at the meeting included Pankratova, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and historian; Lebedeva, physicist; Tsarev, People's Artist of the Soviet Union; Korovin, professor of law; and Polevoy, writer. They pointed out: The American new fascists, in their attempt to seek world hegemony, have shown a despicable and shameless cruelty that exceeds that of Hitler.

    Pankratova said: Now is the time to stop the evil war in Korea, to stop the horrors that the American aggressors have brought to all mankind.

    Lebedeva said: We demand the trial of those who pioneered bacteriological weapons and those who allow the production of bacteriological weapons.

    Professor Korovin said: The recent statements by the Chinese government and the Korean government regarding the responsibility of the U.S. government and the U.S. military personnel who are using evil bacteriological warfare weapons are the true voice of the conscience of all mankind, the voice of the people of the world.

    Full Text of the Resolution

    The participants in the mass meeting of Moscow citizens unanimously passed a resolution, representing all the laboring people of the Soviet capital, angrily protesting against this heinous new crime by the American aggressors. The full text of the resolution is as follows:

    "We—representatives of people's organizations, workers and staff, scientific workers, literary and artistic workers, responded to the call of the Soviet Peace Committee and held a meeting. On behalf of the laboring people of Moscow, we express our firm protest against the heinous crimes of American imperialists in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China.

    The statements issued by Park Heon-yeong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by American aggressors in Korea and Northeast China have aroused deep anger among the people of the world against this crime of the American aggressors.

    American aggressors, under the banner of the United Nations, have begun to use bacteriological weapons against the civilians of Korea and the People's Republic of China, using aircraft to spread bacteria of plague, cholera, typhoid, and other infectious diseases in cities and villages in Korea and Northeast China.

    The honest people of the world are indignant at this inhumane crime, which is unprecedented, a crime that even the Hitlerite cannibals did not dare to commit.

    The people of all countries believe that the American interventionists are violators of international agreements on the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons, weapons of mass destruction of the people.

    Their brutal actions carry the danger of making terrible fatal infectious diseases epidemic in Asian and European countries. The conscience of the people of all countries cannot tolerate the inhumane and barbaric crimes committed by these man-hating murderers who violate the basic standards of human morality.

    The Second World Peace Congress in 1950, representing the wishes of the people of all countries around the world, demanded the unconditional prohibition of all atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass slaughter of the people. The American imperialists completely ignored this call from the people of all countries.

    This unprecedented crime of the American imperialists has aroused deep indignation among all the people of the Soviet Union. The American aggressors' attempt to destroy the will of the Korean people to fight for freedom and independence by spreading bacteria of plague, cholera, and other infectious diseases has aroused universal hatred and contempt. All freedom-loving humanity stands firmly with the Korean people! The Soviet people, together with all peace-loving people, express their fraternal solidarity with the Korean people.

    The citizens of Moscow, like all the people of the Soviet Union, support the statements of Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression, and Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, who call on the people of all countries around the world to unite in angry protest against the crimes of the American aggressors and to prohibit the use of bacteriological weapons for the benefit of all mankind.

    We are convinced that the World Peace Council will take all necessary measures to protect humanity from the threat of germ warfare.

    The people of the world must be vigilant, expose the conspiracies of the instigators of a new world war, and expand the struggle for world peace.

    We are proud that our great motherland stands at the forefront of the defenders of peace. The citizens of Moscow, like all the people of the Soviet Union, will continue to make their utmost efforts to consolidate the strength of their motherland—the fortress of world peace.

    Long live the Stalinist policy of peace of the Soviet Union! Long live the great standard-bearer of peace, our leader and teacher, our Comrade Stalin!"

### 莫斯科劳动人民举行大会支持中朝两国政府声明  坚决抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战罪行  大会决议号召全世界人民揭发新世界大战挑拨者的阴谋

    莫斯科劳动人民举行大会支持中朝两国政府声明
    坚决抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战罪行
    大会决议号召全世界人民揭发新世界大战挑拨者的阴谋
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：莫斯科劳动人民在三月十三日举行盛大的集会，抗议美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器。莫斯科人一致表示支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府对美国政府这种严重的新罪行提出的抗议。
    大会由苏联名历史学家、苏联拥护和平委员会副主席格列科夫院士致开会词。他说，全世界各地千千万万的人民读了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永和中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来的声明，得悉美帝国主义者在朝鲜前线和后方、并在中国东北境内投掷细菌弹，莫不感到无比的愤怒。
    就是希特勒侵略者也不曾胆敢使用细菌武器。但是，现在美帝国主义者却干出历史上空前未有的罪行。
    格列科夫指出：在华沙举行的第二届世界和平大会曾经要求无条件禁止一切种类的原子武器、细菌武器和化学武器，禁止一切毒物、放射性物质和其他一切大规模消灭人类的手段。大会并曾要求，第一个使用这些武器的国家，必须被宣布为战犯。但是，美国政府不愿意注意人民的这次警告。
    格列科夫院士接着指出，美国国务卿艾奇逊在没有几天以前曾致电日内瓦红十字国际委员会，绝口否认关于美国及联合国军在北朝鲜进行细菌战的指责，并建议就这些指责进行“调查”。
    艾奇逊强调说，“调查”应该同时在南北朝鲜两方面进行，但是他却根本没有提到中国。可是根据中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来的声明，人人都知道，最近美国飞机已经不只在朝鲜进行细菌战，而且也把这种活动扩展到中国的东北，在那里投下带有鼠疫、霍乱和伤寒菌的苍蝇和跳蚤。
    格列科夫院士揭露  艾奇逊不敢表示反对细菌战  阴谋掩盖散布细菌无耻罪行
    格列科夫院士继续说，艾奇逊不得不重视这个声明，因为亚洲和欧洲人民，甚至美国本国的人民，对美国使用细菌武器所感到的愤怒愈来愈高涨，影响到的阶层也愈来愈广大。
    艾奇逊提出这个“调查”的建议，不过是想躲闪一下，想借以藏身。他显然以为，在日内瓦红十字国际委员会里自有一批人会履行他的任何命令；或者他以为，空谈一下“调查”，最低限度可以帮助转移公众的注意，可以掩藏艾奇逊手下的人在朝鲜和中国正在越来越大规模进行的散布鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒和其他病菌的可耻事实。这些人有着美国飞机供他们调遣，可以在夜间飞越朝鲜和中国北部。
    格列科夫又说：最值得注意的事情是，艾奇逊已经是第二次否认在朝鲜的美国军队曾使用细菌武器了，可是，关于使用细菌武器的行为是不可容许的这一点，他却连一个字也不谈。他对这一点保持缄默。显然，他不但决不反对细菌战，而且还是这种无耻的、穷凶极恶的、惨无人道的战争的狂热的鼓吹者。
    在美国，有许多人喜欢在记者招待会和官方的会议上谈论战争预算的膨胀、军队实力的增长和新战争的准备工作。最近美国政府的几个正式代表人物，包括罗克斯将军、克利西将军和其他等人，曾经发表了一些长篇的报告，报告他们对于大规模的细菌战的准备工作。这些官员们都大谈细菌战是必要的。既然是这样，他们还怎么能够主张斥责细菌战争呢？当他们在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器而当场被捉住的时候，他们除了闭口不言或设法抵赖以外不能有别的行动，这难道还不明显吗？他们是不能够斥责在朝鲜和中国所进行的细菌战争的。他们不谈这一点，他们规避这一点，他们企图在他们雇用的特务们的帮助下组织某种“调查”，来掩盖他们的罪行。
    全世界的人民，一切国家的正直人民必须起来斥责这些正在使用一种不义的武器、进行细菌战的战争罪犯们。
    只要是艾奇逊仍然不敢斥责细菌战——不管是在哪里进行的，是在朝鲜、在中国、或在其他任何地方——只要是艾奇逊还不敢那样作，一切正直的人民就要认为他是这种不义的、不人道的战争的主张者。
    格列科夫院士最后说：我们深信，世界和平理事会一定会采取一切必要的措施，以保障人类免受细菌战争以及其他大规模消灭人类的手段的威胁。
    会上，许多科学家、工人和知识分子纷纷发言，表现出千千万万苏联人民的想法和情感。他们一致斥责那些双手染满妇孺老弱的鲜血的美国侵略者的可耻，并坚决地抗议美国政府使用细菌武器。
    苏联医药科学院副院长儒可夫—维列日尼科夫重提苏联在伯力对十二名被控制造并使用细菌武器的前日本军队人员的审讯。他说，那次判决是对一切帝国主义者及其同谋犯的严重警告。但是，美帝国主义者竟至丧心病狂到如此的地步，就在当时，他们还敢包庇一名重大的日本战犯——监制对中国使用的细菌武器的细菌学家石井四郎。美帝国主义者公开利用石井四郎来准备新的滔天罪行。
    现在，美帝国主义者已对朝鲜进行细菌攻击。他们这样就严重地破坏了关于禁止使用细菌武器的国际条约。
    儒可夫—维列日尼科夫继续说：苏联科学家对美帝国主义者这些罪恶的行为表示愤怒的抗议。苏联科学家坚决相信，和平力量比战争力量强大得多。
    接着是“红色无产者工厂”的领班伯洛夫讲话。他说：我，一个苏联工人，控告美国杀人犯对和平、对良知和对全人类犯下的罪行。我控告以杜鲁门为首的美国冒险家，控告他们破坏基本的国际法。我控告这一切罪行的策动人美帝国主义者。全世界人民——法国人和德国人、英国人和美国人、荷兰人和瑞典人、印度人和日本人，全世界一切正直的人民都将要发出他们抗议的呼声。这伙杀人犯，这伙罪犯，一定会受到惩罚。
    斯科贝尔琴院士指出  苏联科学家和进步人类一道  抗议美国吃人生番滔天罪行
    “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会主席斯科贝尔琴院士说：发动细菌战争的责任，不仅在于美帝国主义者，而且参与他们这种罪行的同谋犯——美国科学家也同样要负责任，这些人辱没了科学家这个光荣和崇高的称号。他们把生命的科学——生物学——变成了死亡的科学。科学发展的目标和原则，无论何时何地本来都应该是建设性的、创造性的和给生命以力量的。在社会主义胜利了的国家里的科学就是这样，那里的科学家正在胜利地解决延长人类寿命的种种问题，并正在研究消灭人类疾病和痛苦的最有效的办法。可是，美国的所谓科学家们已经背离了这种人道的原则与目标。
    斯科贝尔琴说：苏联科学家和全体进步人类一道，抗议美国吃人生番——这些威胁全世界人民的野兽——的这种滔天罪行。
    作家爱伦堡发表了动人的演说。爱伦堡说：在一月底，美国陆军化学兵团研究与发展处处长克利西将军对细菌战大事赞扬，他说：“我相信我们正在研究的这种武器可以使我们能够花最少的代价削弱敌人的抵抗力量，从而取得胜利，而不致毁灭它的经济。……和原子弹或者其他爆炸性的武器不一样，生物武器主要是对付人的，因为这种武器并不毁坏建筑物和机器，而是用来对付人本身或者人的食物——牲畜和谷物的。”不久以后，美国决定在朝鲜和中国试验克利西将军的“研究和发展”了。
    作家爱伦堡说  苏联人民要求停止细菌战争  坚决主张严厉惩办细菌战犯
    细菌战是不人道的，难道这还用说吗？克利西将军好像是一个贩卖死亡和散布传染病的商人似的，他说鼠疫、霍乱或者伤寒都比炸弹便宜。他估计用“最少的代价”。他强调说，如果人害病死了，工厂和房子就会原封不动地落到战胜者手里。这真是丧心病狂，这真是骇人听闻，难道克利西将军和那些正在散布带菌毒虫的人还是人吗？他们现在的行为是罪大恶极而又极其愚蠢的。他们认识到他们已不能取胜，于是采取令人愤慨的卑鄙的报复行为。全人类都鄙弃他们。他们再也不要想得到人民的支持。他们还有什么呢？毒虫吗？可是带菌的跳蚤是不能支持他们多久的。
    爱伦堡接着说，我们这些和平的莫斯科的公民要求立即停止细菌战，我们坚决主张惩办罪犯。我们要求这样做，不单是因为我们对侵略者的行为和他们所抱的征服自由的亚洲人民的恶毒愿望感到愤慨，而且因为我们尊敬巴斯德和鄙视培养病菌的假科学家，因为我们希望把各洲和各国人民从新的浩劫中拯救出来。我们不反对美国人民，我们反对伤寒，反对霍乱，反对鼠疫，反对培养伤寒、霍乱和鼠疫的人。我们要保卫具有最大价值的东西——人的生命。
    接着发言的是三山纺织厂工人孟席科娃。她着重指出：美国侵略者使用细菌武器并不是证明敌人有力量，而是证明他们的懦弱和绝望，这个敌人甚至比希特勒法西斯匪徒还残酷和卑鄙。我们三山纺织厂的男女工人、工程师、技术人员和职员，与全体亿万苏联人民一样，坚决抗议这些人类之敌的罪恶行动。我厂全体人员授命我要求世界和平理事会马上采取必要措施，制止用细菌武器大规模屠杀人民的行为。
    苏联拥护和平委员会委员、科罗姆纳和克卢提柴教区总主教尼古拉说：俄罗斯东正教教会和它的牧师之一——我本人，与全体苏联人民以及全体爱好和平的进步人类，同声愤慨地抗议这种罪行！那些在朝鲜发动细菌战的人，在他们国内发表演说时常常引证圣经，硬说他们打算“保卫基督教文明”，自称为基督徒，这对每一个真正信奉基督教义的人来说，是最大的渎神罪。这些伪善者自称为基督徒。这些伪善者不是基督徒。他们不是人。他们没有良心，没有慈悲心。他们对他们的恶毒罪行毫无责任感。
    其他在会上发言的有苏联科学院通讯院士、历史学家潘克拉托娃，物理学家列别节娃，苏联人民艺术家查列夫，法学教授柯罗文和作家波列伏伊。他们指出：美国新法西斯分子在力图谋取世界霸权时所表现的卑鄙和无耻的残酷，超过了希特勒。
    潘克拉托娃说：现在已经是制止在朝鲜的罪恶战争、制止美国侵略者给全人类带来的那些恐怖的时候了。
    列别节娃说：我们要求审判首创细菌武器的人们和允许生产细菌武器的人们。
    柯罗文教授说：中国政府和朝鲜政府最近所发表的关于美国政府和正在使用罪恶的细菌战争武器的美军人员的责任的声明，是全人类的良心的真正的呼声，是全世界人民的呼声。
    大会决议全文
    参加莫斯科市民群众大会的人们一致通过了一个决议，代表苏联首都的全体劳动人民，愤怒地抗议美国侵略者这一个穷凶极恶的新罪行。决议全文如下：
    “我们——人民团体的代表们、工人和职员们、科学工作者们、文学艺术工作者们，响应苏联拥护和平委员会的号召，举行了大会。我们代表莫斯科劳动人民，对于美国帝国主义者在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器的穷凶极恶的罪行，表示坚决的抗议。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永和中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来所发表的关于美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器的声明，已经激起了全世界人民对美国侵略者的这种罪行的深深的忿怒。
    美国侵略者已经在联合国的旗帜下，开始对朝鲜和中华人民共和国的平民使用细菌武器，用飞机在朝鲜和中国东北部的城市和乡村散布鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒及其他传染病的细菌。
    全世界的正直人民都对这种违反人道的罪行感到愤慨，这是史无前例的、甚至希特勒吃人生番也没有敢犯的罪行。
    全世界各国人民认为：美国干涉者是关于禁止使用细菌武器这种大批毁灭人民的武器的国际协定的破坏者。
    他们这种残暴的行动，有使可怕的致命的传染病在亚洲和欧洲各国大流行起来的危险。各国人民的良心不能容忍这些破坏人类道义基本标准的憎恨人类的凶徒们所犯下的这种不人道的野蛮罪行。
    一九五○年第二届世界和平大会代表全世界各国人民的愿望，要求无条件禁止一切原子武器、细菌武器、化学武器及其他大规模屠杀人民的武器。美帝国主义者却完全不理睬各国人民的这一呼声。
    美帝国主义者的这种前所未闻的罪行已引起苏联全体人民深深的愤慨。美国侵略者想用撒布鼠疫、霍乱及其他传染病细菌的办法来摧毁朝鲜人民争取自由与独立的意志，这种暴行已激起了普遍的憎恨与鄙视。全体爱好自由的人类坚决与朝鲜人民站在一起！苏联人民与一切爱好和平的人民一起对朝鲜人民表示友爱的团结。
    莫斯科市民与苏联全体人民一样，支持中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若的声明和世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里的声明，他们号召全世界各国人民一致愤怒地抗议美国侵略者的罪行，并且为了全人类的利益，禁止使用细菌武器。
    我们确信：世界和平理事会一定会采取一切必要的措施以保卫人类免受细菌战的威胁。
    全世界人民必须提高警惕，揭发新世界大战挑拨者的阴谋，必须扩大争取世界和平的斗争。
    我们因为我们伟大的祖国站在和平保卫者的前列而感到自豪。莫斯科市民与苏联全体人民一样，将继续以最大的努力巩固他们的祖国——世界和平堡垒——的威力。
    苏联的斯大林和平外交政策万岁！伟大的和平旗手、我们的领袖与导师、我们的斯大林同志万岁！”
