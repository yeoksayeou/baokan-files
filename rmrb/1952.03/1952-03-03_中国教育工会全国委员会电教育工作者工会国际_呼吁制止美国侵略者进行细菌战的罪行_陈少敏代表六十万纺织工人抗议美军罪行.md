Xinhua News Agency, 1st: The Chairman of the All-China Federation of Education Unions, Wu Yuzhang, sent a cable to the International Federation of Teachers' Unions, calling for a halt to the heinous crimes of bacteriological warfare by American aggressors. The text of the cable is as follows:

    Vienna
    To Comrade Delanue, Secretariat of the International Federation of Teachers' Unions:
    The American aggressors are conducting inhumane bacteriological warfare on the Korean front and in the rear, which is the greatest threat to humanity and world civilization. We hope that the International Federation of Teachers' Unions will call on educators around the world to stop the heinous crimes of the American aggressors.
    Chairman of the All-China Federation of Education Unions, Wu Yuzhang
    February 29th

[This newspaper reports] Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, issued a statement on behalf of 600,000 textile workers nationwide, resolutely protesting with immense anger against the heinous crimes of bacteriological warfare by American aggressors on the Korean front. The statement is as follows:

    The frenzied American aggressors have, since January 28, continuously and massively spread bacteria such as plague and cholera on the Korean front and in the rear, killing peaceful Korean residents and threatening China's security. The American imperialists are妄想 using bacteriological warfare to salvage their disastrous defeat on the Korean front. The Chinese textile workers will resolutely not tolerate such inhumane and barbarous behavior by the American aggressors. We will take practical actions, vigorously launch the movement for increased production and thrift, and resolutely carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to the end, in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. And we request the International Textile and Garment Workers' Federation to call on textile and garment workers around the world to unite and denounce the heinous crimes of the American aggressors.
    We are convinced that our war against American imperialist aggression in Korea is just, and no brutal weapon can destroy the victory of the Chinese and Korean people, while the American aggressors will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.
    Chairman of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, Chen Shaomin

    维也纳
    教育工作者工会国际书记处亲爱的德拉努同志：
    美国侵略者在朝鲜前线和后方进行绝灭人性的细菌战争，这是对于人类及世界文明的最大威胁。我们希望教育工作者工会国际，号召全世界教育工作者，制止美国侵略者的滔天罪行。

    【本报讯】中国纺织工会全国委员会主席陈少敏代表全国六十万纺织职工发表声明，以无比愤怒的心情，坚决抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜前线进行细菌战争的滔天罪行。声明如下：
    疯狂了的美国侵略者，从一月二十八日起，连续在朝鲜前线和后方，再度大量散布鼠疫霍乱等细菌，杀害朝鲜和平居民，威胁中国的安全。美国帝国主义者妄想用细菌战争来挽救他们在朝鲜前线的惨败。中国纺织工人坚决不能容忍美国侵略者这种惨无人道的野蛮行为，我们以自己的实际行动，大力展开增产节约运动，坚决地把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动进行到底，来支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。并要求纺织服装工会国际，号召全世界的纺织服装工人一致起来申诉美国侵略者的滔天罪行。
    我们确信我们反对美国帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争是正义的，任何残暴的武器都不能摧毁中朝人民的胜利，而美国侵略者将必然遭受到可耻的失败。
    中国纺织工会全国委员会主席  陈少敏
    一九五二年三月一日
