    The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Decides to Abolish the Degenerate Jiaohe County Party Committee Organization
    The Jiaohe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and most of its members, under the corrosion of the bourgeoisie, degenerated and betrayed the interests of the Party and the people. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to abolish the Jiaohe County Committee organization and expel bad elements such as Yin Zihua, secretary of the County Committee, and members Ren Guocai, Cui Xiaoguang, and Li Shuren from the Party.
    Yin Zihua, secretary of the Jiaohe County Committee and County Head, and Cui Xiaoguang, member of the County Committee and secretary of the Youth Work Committee, were class alien elements who had infiltrated the Chinese Communist Party. When Yin Zihua was secretary of the county government and county head, he made many unscrupulous merchants his "friends." He successively stole more than 52,000 catties of rice and 30,000 catties of yellow tobacco from the county government at low prices on credit and gave them to the unscrupulous merchant Liang Qifa for speculation and profiteering, causing a loss of 140 million yuan in state assets. The unscrupulous merchant Liang Qifa and Yin Zihua's second younger brother opened a fire-saw factory in Changchun, specializing in stealing state timber. The value of the timber stolen from the provincial Jiaohe Lumber Mill alone reached 1 billion yuan. He monopolized the Jiaohe timber market and usurped the leadership of the Jiaohe Lumber Mill. Yin Zihua and Qingwei Secretary Cui Xiaoguang, in order to protect the thieves from carrying out speculation and profiteering safely, successively lent their pistols to the unscrupulous merchant Liang Qifa to carry, and issued county government passports, allowing him to swagger and deceive everywhere. The unscrupulous merchant Liang Qifa took the County Party Secretary's pistol to Tianjin, Harbin, Jinzhou and other places to do speculative business, and often swaggered in and out of restaurants, pubs, and the County Party Committee and County Government with Yin Zihua and others. Even when the Jiaohe County Committee was in session, the unscrupulous merchant Liang Qifa could go in and listen without anyone caring. This fueled the arrogance of the unscrupulous merchants. Liang Qifa could call the head of the Cultural and Educational Section of the County Government to a store in front of the masses and "scold him severely." When a certain organ held a Party branch meeting and did not allow him to enter, he glared and said, "The County Committee does not avoid me when it holds meetings." He raped women, gambled openly, and was not subject to legal sanctions. He declared, "There is no jail cell in Jiaohe County for me to squat in." Those traitors who betrayed the interests of the Party and the people often humbled themselves in front of the unscrupulous merchant Liang Qifa and were willing to be used. Cui Xiaoguang even apologized repeatedly to the unscrupulous merchant with a grin after being scolded by him. Yin Zihua also asked his son and the unscrupulous merchant's son to become "sworn brothers," and allowed his mistress (a woman with an unclear identity) to live in the unscrupulous merchant's home. He often obtained cameras, watches, bicycles, clothing and other materials from the unscrupulous merchant. When Yin Zihua's third younger brother got married, private merchants sent more than 20 congratulatory banners.
    The Jiaohe County Committee, under the manipulation of Yin Zihua, became a corrupt and degenerate reactionary group. The vast majority of the County Committee members had accepted gifts from private merchants and eaten at their banquets. Five County Committee members had exchanged watches with private merchants. Armed Forces Minister Li Shuren sent explosives to unscrupulous merchants for fishing and sent hunting rifles to private merchants for hunting, and openly sheltered his father-in-law from illegally selling timber. Public Security Bureau Chief Ren Guocai took public land as his own and had soldiers from the Public Security Team and the labor reform team cultivate it for him. They adopted a policy of outwardly complying but inwardly opposing the resolutions and instructions of the higher Party and government. The County Committee not only failed to lead the labor mutual aid groups, but also approved certain mutual aid groups to transport timber and hire long-term workers, and condoned certain Party members in rural areas to develop capitalism. The leadership of cooperative societies throughout the county was almost entirely usurped by speculative merchants. No serious criticism or self-criticism was ever carried out in the County Committee. They shielded each other, concealed information from above, and oppressed those below. In particular, the misdeeds of County Party Secretary Yin Zihua and others had long been opposed by the Party and the masses. Many Party member cadres had criticized Yin Zihua, and some people had publicly criticized him at the County People's Congress; however, these criticisms were suppressed by various shameless means. Organization Minister Meng Yashu not only failed to uphold Party principles and fight against Yin Zihua based on the opinions of the masses, but defended him in front of the masses.
    After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, Yin Zihua and the unscrupulous merchant Han Yupu formed an "offensive and defensive alliance" and refused to confess. The responsible comrade of the Provincial Committee personally talked to him, and the inspection team of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party presented evidence of his corruption and illegal activities, but he still tried his best to conceal them and refused to bow his head. Public Security Bureau Chief Ren Guocai used various despicable means to sabotage the "Three-Anti" campaign. He threatened and paralyzed the cadres of the Public Security Bureau with words such as "respect for leaders" and "obedience to superiors," in an attempt to cover up his crimes, and formed an "offensive and defensive alliance" with corrupt elements. After the Northeast Bureau inspection team exposed his crimes, he still tried to quibble in many ways. Cui Xiaoguang continued to borrow money from private merchants after the start of the "Three-Anti" campaign, and mutually covered up for Yin Zihua.
    In order to enforce Party discipline, purify the Party organization, and educate all Party member cadres, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to impose the punishment of abolishing its leading organ on the Jiaohe County Party organization, and form a new County Committee. County Party Secretary and County Head Yin Zihua is a class alien element who colluded with unscrupulous merchants and condoned them in stealing large amounts of state assets, causing extremely serious damage to the Party's political prestige among the masses. It was decided to remove him from the position of County Party Secretary, expel him from the Party, and recommend that the People's Government remove him from the position of County Head and hand him over to the judicial organs for handling in accordance with the law. County Committee member and Public Security Bureau Chief Ren Guocai stole public funds for personal gain and embezzled more than 100 million yuan. It was decided to expel him from the Party and recommend that the People's Government remove him from the position of Public Security Bureau Chief and hand him over to the judicial organs for handling in accordance with the law. County Committee member and Youth Work Committee Secretary Cui Xiaoguang is a class alien element who infiltrated the Party, has consistently been corrupt and degenerate, and openly colluded with unscrupulous merchants. It was decided to remove him from his position, expel him from the Party, and hand him over to the judicial organs for handling in accordance with the law. County Committee Armed Forces Minister Li Shuren, Deputy County Head Liu Chuanyong, County Committee member and Organization Minister Meng Yashu, County Committee member and Propaganda Minister Feng Gang, etc., were all subjected to disciplinary sanctions according to the seriousness of their mistakes.
    The fact that most members of the Jiaohe County Committee were so corroded by the bourgeoisie was due to the impure organization of the County Committee and the bad character of some Party members, but the fact that the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party failed to detect this for a long time proves that the bureaucracy and right-leaning paralysis of the Provincial Committee leadership was quite serious. According to the Jilin Provincial Committee's self-criticism, since 1949, the Provincial Committee has often only pursued production figures, seriously lacked political and ideological education for cadres, and in particular, has not seriously and strictly reviewed the Party committees at all levels ideologically, politically, and organizationally. The Provincial Committee only one-sidedly felt that the Jiaohe County Committee could still complete its production tasks, and therefore blindly believed in the work of the County Committee. Although the various departments of the Provincial Committee often sent people to Jiaohe, the people who went down to inspect the work mostly only took care of temporary departmental tasks, or only went to villages and towns, and never understood the work of the County Committee. The responsible comrades of the Provincial Committee did not personally conduct a systematic inspection of the work and thinking of the County Committee, so that they failed to discover and correct the degeneration of the County Committee in time, causing serious losses to the Party. From this, it can be seen that the Jilin Provincial Committee should bear certain responsibility for the degeneration of the Jiaohe County Committee.

    中共吉林省委员会决定
    撤销蜕化变质的蛟河县委会组织
    中共蛟河县委会及其大部成员，在资产阶级腐蚀下，蜕化变质，出卖了党和人民的利益。中共吉林省委决定撤销蛟河县委会组织并开除县委书记殷子华、委员任国才、崔晓光、李树仁等坏分子出党。
    中共蛟河县委书记兼县长殷子华和县委委员兼青年工作委员会书记崔晓光，是混入中国共产党内的阶级异己分子。殷子华还在担任县政府秘书和县长时期，他就结交了不少奸商做“朋友”，先后用低价赊买的办法，从县政府窃取大米五万二千多斤、黄烟三万斤给奸商梁启发，进行投机倒把，使国家资财损失一亿四千多万元。奸商梁启发和殷子华的二弟在长春开办了一处火锯厂，专门盗窃国家的木材，仅省营蛟河制材厂被他窃去的木材，价值即达十亿元之巨。他垄断了蛟河木材市场，篡夺了蛟河制材厂的领导权。殷子华和青委书记崔晓光，为了保护盗窃犯安然进行投机倒把，曾先后把自己的手枪借给奸商梁启发携带，并发给县政府的护照，让他到处招摇撞骗。奸商梁启发带着县委书记的手枪到天津、哈尔滨、锦州等地做投机买卖，并和殷子华等人经常大摇大摆地出入于饭馆酒铺和县委会、县政府。甚至蛟河县委在开会时，奸商梁启发也可进去旁听，无人过问。这就助长了奸商横行霸道的气焰。梁启发可以当着群众的面把县政府文教科科长叫到一家商店去“大加申斥”。某机关召开党的支部会议时，不让他进去，他瞪着眼睛说：“县委开会也不回避我。”他奸污妇女，公开聚赌，而不受法律制裁。他扬言“蛟河县没有我蹲的班房”。那些出卖党和人民利益的叛徒，常常在奸商梁启发面前低声下气，甘受利用。崔晓光甚至挨了奸商一顿骂以后，还嘻皮笑脸地向奸商连声道歉。殷子华还叫自己的儿子和奸商的儿子拜“干兄弟”，让自己的姘头（一个面目不清的女人）寄居在奸商家里。并经常从奸商那里取得照像机、手表、自行车、衣料等物资，殷子华三弟结婚，私商就送来了贺幛二十多块。
    蛟河县委会在殷子华操纵下面，变成了贪污腐化的反动集团，绝大多数县委都接受过私商的礼物，吃过私商的酒席，有五个县委委员和私商换过表。武装部长李树仁送炸药给奸商炸鱼，送猎枪给私商打猎，并公开包庇他的岳父违法贩卖木材。公安局长任国才把公家的土地据为己有，并让公安队的战士和劳动改造队给他耕作。他们对上级党和政府的决议和指示，采取阳奉阴违的态度。县委不仅没有去领导劳动互助组，反而批准某些互助组贩运木材和雇长工，纵容农村的某些党员发展资本主义。全县合作社的领导权几乎大部被投机商人所篡夺。在县委会中，从来没有展开严肃的批评和自我批评。他们互相包庇，对上隐瞒，对下欺压。特别是县委书记殷子华等的胡作非为，早已为党内外群众所反对，有不少的党员干部曾向殷子华提出批评意见，在县人民代表会议上，也曾有人公开向他提出批评；但这些批评意见都被用各种无耻的手段压制下去。组织部长孟雅书不仅没有根据群众意见，坚持党的原则，向殷子华作斗争，反替他在群众面前辩护。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开后，殷子华和奸商韩玉璞订立了“攻守同盟”，拒不坦白。省委负责同志亲自找他谈话，中共中央东北局检查组拿出了他的贪污违法实据，他仍然极力掩饰，不肯低头。公安局长任国才利用各种卑鄙手段破坏“三反”运动。他以“尊重首长”和“服从上级”的话来威胁和麻痹公安局的干部，企图掩盖自己的罪行，并和贪污分子订立“攻守同盟”。经东北局检查组将其罪行揭发后，他仍多方狡辩。崔晓光在“三反”运动开始后，还到处向私商借钱，并和殷子华互相打掩护。
    为了严肃党的纪律，纯洁党的组织并教育全体党员干部，中共吉林省委决定给予蛟河县党的组织以撤销其领导机关的处分，另行组成新的县委。县委书记、县长殷子华，系阶级异己分子，和奸商勾结，纵容奸商大量盗窃国家资财，使党在群众中的政治威信遭受了极其严重的损失，决定撤销其县委书记的职务，开除其党籍，并建议人民政府撤销其县长职务，交司法机关法办。县委委员、公安局长任国才，盗公肥私，贪污达一亿元以上，决定开除其党籍，并建议人民政府撤销其公安局局长职务，交司法机关法办。县委委员、青委书记崔晓光是混进党内的阶级异己分子，一贯贪污腐化，公开和奸商勾结，决定撤销其职务，开除其党籍，交司法机关法办。县委武装部长李树仁，副县长刘传永，县委委员、组织部长孟雅书，县委委员、宣传部长冯刚等均按其犯错误的轻重，受到纪律制裁。
    中共蛟河县委大部成员被资产阶级腐蚀到如此地步，固然是由于县委组织不纯，部分党员品质恶劣所致，但中共吉林省委对此长期未能察觉，这证明了省委领导方面的官僚主义和右倾麻痹思想是相当严重的。据中共吉林省委检讨，自一九四九年以来，省委常常只是追求生产数字，严重地缺乏对干部的政治思想教育，特别是没有认真从思想上、政治上、组织上系统地、严格地审查各级党委。省委只片面地觉得蛟河县委在生产上还能完成任务，因此盲目地相信该县县委的工作。省委各部门虽也常派人去蛟河，但下去检查工作的人员，多是只顾临时性的部门任务，或只到村屯，始终没有对县委工作进行了解。省委各负责同志也没有亲自对该县县委的工作和思想进行系统检查，以致未能及时发现该县县委蜕化变质的情况，并加以纠正，给党造成了严重损失。由此可见，对于蛟河县委的蜕化变质，中共吉林省委应负有一定的责任。
