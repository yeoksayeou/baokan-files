Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 19th: At the March 19th staff meeting on the fourth item of the Korean armistice negotiations agenda, the two sides did not engage in concrete discussions today because the other side was not yet prepared with a response to the questions our side raised yesterday requesting clarification from the other side.

At the staff meeting on the third agenda item, the other side proposed revised suggestions regarding the specific locations of the designated ports of entry for both sides. They proposed designating Sinuiju, Chongjin, Hamhung (including Hungnam), Manpo, Chinnampo, and the airfield near Pyongyang as our designated ports of entry; while their own designated ports of entry would be Busan, Incheon, Gangneung, Gunsan, and Daegu. Our side pointed out that both sides had clearly agreed that the number of designated ports of entry for each side would be five. The other side's proposal regarding our designated ports of entry actually exceeds the number of five designated ports. Hamhung and Hungnam are undoubtedly two separate ports. Our side originally proposed Hamhung, but after considering the other side's opinions, changed Hamhung to Hungnam. As for Chinnampo and the Pyongyang airfield, they are fundamentally not ports that we intend to use for the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of weapons and ammunition, and cannot be considered for inclusion among the designated ports of entry.

    朝鲜谈判仍无进展
    【新华社开城十九日电】三月十九日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程参谋会议上，因对方对于我方昨天提出要求对方予以澄清的问题的答复尚未准备就绪，双方在今天会上，未进行具体讨论。
    第三项议程参谋会议上，对方提出关于双方特定口岸的具体地点的修正建议，提议将我方特定口岸定为新义州、清津、咸兴包括兴南、满浦、镇南浦与平壤附近机场；对方本身特定口岸则为釜山、仁川、江陵、群山、大邱。我方指出双方已经明确协议规定每方特定口岸的数目为五个，对方所提出的关于我方特定口岸的建议，事实上是超过了五个特定口岸的数目。咸兴与兴南毫无疑问地是两个口岸，我方原先提出咸兴，但在考虑对方意见后，已将咸兴改作兴南。至于镇南浦与平壤机场，根本不是我方准备用作进入军事人员的轮换与武器弹药替换的口岸，不能考虑包括在特定口岸之内。
