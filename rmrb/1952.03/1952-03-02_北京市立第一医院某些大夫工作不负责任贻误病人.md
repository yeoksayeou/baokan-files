    Certain Doctors at Beijing Municipal First Hospital Are Irresponsible and Delay Treatment

    To the Editor:

    I was once sick and stayed in the Beijing Municipal First Hospital for more than ten days. I felt that the doctors in this hospital had a very serious bureaucratic style, and many patients felt the same way. On the evening of January 23rd, a woman suffering from a sudden acute illness was carried in. She had a stomach ache, writhing in bed in pain, grabbing wildly with both hands, constantly talking nonsense and vomiting. Her husband, Hua Baolian, was so anxious that he stamped his feet and scratched his head. All the patients in our ward were anxious and worried about the woman's life. However, the doctor did not come that night, and it was not until the next evening that a doctor came. This doctor did not consult with the obstetrics and gynecology doctor and determined that she was pregnant and needed to be operated on immediately. After the operation, it was discovered that she was not pregnant but had peritonitis. At that time, the doctor immediately gave her a blood transfusion, but before the blood transfusion was completed, she died. In addition, there was another woman who was being treated at the Beijing Municipal First Hospital. The doctor diagnosed her illness as appendicitis, but after the operation, it was discovered that her illness was not appendicitis but oophoritis, and she was rushed to the obstetrics and gynecology department. The doctors at Beijing Municipal First Hospital are so irresponsible, careless, and unconcerned about the lives and suffering of patients that they should conduct a review.

    北京市立第一医院某些大夫工作不负责任贻误病人
    编辑同志：有一次我生了病，在北京市立第一医院住了十来天。我觉得这个医院的大夫有很严重的官僚主义作风，许多病人对这一点都有同样的感觉。一月二十三日晚上，一个害着急病的妇女被抬到这里，她肚子痛，痛得在床上打滚，两手乱抓，不住地胡说和呕吐。她的丈夫华宝连急得直跺脚，抓脑袋。我们整个病房的病人都为这位妇人的生命焦急担心。但是那天晚上大夫一直都没有来，直到第二天晚上才来了一个大夫。这个大夫并没有和产科大夫商量，就断定她有了孕，并要立刻开刀。开刀后发现不是有孕，而是腹膜炎。当时大夫就立刻给她输血，但是血还没有输完，她便绝气了。另外又有一位妇女在北京市立第一医院治病，大夫断定她的病是盲肠炎，可是开刀后发现她的病并不是盲肠炎，而是卵窠炎，便赶忙把她送到妇产科去。北京市立第一医院大夫对工作这样的不负责任，粗枝大叶，不关心病人的生命和病痛，应该进行检讨。    赵恩馥
