    Centenary of Gogol's Death Anniversary
    Cao Jinghua

    Gogol, the founder of Russian critical realism literature in the first half of the 19th century, who was as famous as Pushkin, has been dead for a full hundred years. Last year, the World Peace Council decided that people all over the world should solemnly commemorate him, which has world-wide political and educational significance in strengthening cultural ties between peoples of all countries and striving for world peace.

    Gogol was born on April 1, 1809, in Sorochintsy Village, Mirgorod County, Poltava Province, Southern Russia. His father was a not-so-wealthy landlord who had considerable literary talent and wrote plays and poems in Ukrainian. His mother came from a noble family. Gogol spent his childhood in this remote little place. The customs and scenery of Ukraine left indelible impressions on him. He loved the folk songs, stories, and rich Ukrainian language of his hometown. These became the source of material for some of his later works about Ukraine. At the same time, Gogol also liked Russian literature, liked acting, and acted very well. His later interest in writing plays took root at this time. From an early age, he was influenced by Pushkin's thoughts and hoped to do more for his motherland in the future.

    In 1828, after graduating from Nezhin High School, Gogol went to St. Petersburg, hoping to serve in an agency, but was disappointed. What he heard and saw were all phenomena of self-interest, baseness, and shamelessness. He could not find a job and his life fell into extreme difficulties. As a last resort, he even considered becoming an actor. In 1829, he finally found a job as a junior clerk. But he soon realized that such an environment and such a job would not benefit Russia in any way.

    In early 1831, he gave up this job and became a teacher at a girls' high school for a period of time. At this time, he met the contemporary writers Zhukovsky and the great poet Pushkin. Pushkin, in particular, played a great role in Gogol's future literary achievements.

    Gogol loved literature since childhood. He began writing while studying in middle school, but those were just initial attempts. After he met Pushkin, the great poet carefully noticed the young writer's talent, especially his ability to "speculate about people and be able to sketch a vivid image with a few sudden strokes." In 1831, he published the first volume of "Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka," which was welcomed by readers. Pushkin said in a letter: "What frank, natural, and real joy... How poetic and emotional some places are! This is an extraordinary event in our literature..."

    Pushkin was the person Gogol admired most. The great poet's praise was especially precious to Gogol. The path of serving the motherland that Gogol had been searching for a long time had now truly been found. This path was creation.

    In 1832, the second volume of "Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka" was published. Both volumes were about Ukrainian life. The customs, people, folk songs, stories, historical events of his hometown, as well as the natural environment in which Gogol lived in his childhood, were all described with familiarity and affection. Laughter and sorrow, jest and fear, the contemporary and the past, keen realistic observation and bold imaginative creation, are all blended in these works. Realistic and secular portrayals and romantic story-like narratives are tightly intertwined. Between the lines are overflowing deep love for the motherland and love for the people.

    Life in St. Petersburg opened up a new vision for Gogol. In addition to interacting with some writers, scholars, actors, and artists, what he heard and saw were groups of foxes and rats, rampant bribery, and all the brutal and dark phenomena of the Nicholas I era, all nakedly exposed before him. The new environment in St. Petersburg gradually diluted the old impressions of Ukraine. In 1836, he wrote to Pushkin: "The shadow of the provinces has faded in my mind... But life in St. Petersburg is very clear in my eyes, and its color vividly and strongly reflects in my mind."

    Gogol absorbed images and selected tones here, writing some works on the theme of the prosperous life of St. Petersburg under harsh rule: "Nevsky Prospekt," "The Portrait," "Diary of a Madman," "The Nose," "The Overcoat," etc.

    There is a Russian proverb: "Don't blame the mirror if your face is crooked."

    The Nicholas I era was incomparably harsh. He wanted to completely eradicate all the roots of democracy and freedom with drastic measures. The execution of the Decembrists in 1825 was a clear example. The people's freedom of speech had long been deprived. Literature, especially satirical writing, became the only tool for progressive writers to express their opinions on reality from the side. In 1833, Gogol wanted to write a "comedy like a mirror" to reflect the ugly face of Russia at that time. This plan was realized in "The Inspector General" written in 1835.

    This book is about a passing gambler who, in desperation, pretends to be an inspector general. This story was originally told to him by Pushkin. Gogol fiercely criticized all the ugliness in officialdom here: baseness, arrogance, corruption, bribery, rumor-mongering, dimness, confusion, and other strange phenomena, and gave it a hot satire. This comedic mirror reflected the strangely shaped "crooked face" of Russia, shocking society at that time. After the play premiered in 1836, Gogol wrote in a letter to the actor Shchepkin: "Everyone is against me. Bureaucrats... police... merchants... writers... are all against me... Now I see the meaning of a comedy writer. If there is even a shadow of truth, they will attack you in droves, and not just one person, but the whole society."

    In fact, those who attacked in droves at that time were not the entire society, but the most reactionary ruling class. Gogol was greeted with fervent cheers and supreme respect in the eyes of the progressive social strata. At that time, he only noticed the attacks of the reactionary group. As a result, he was greatly stimulated and went abroad in 1836. He went to Germany, Switzerland, and Paris. In 1837, he went to Rome. He liked this place very much and decided to live there for a long time. He continued to write his magnum opus "Dead Souls" abroad, which he had already started in 1835.

    Pushkin had long advised Gogol to write a large-scale work. The story of "Dead Souls" was also told to him by Pushkin. Under the serf system, landlords not only owned land, but also owned the serfs on the land. These serfs were called "souls." They were like livestock and could be bought and sold along with the land. The state investigated the number of serfs owned by landlords every ten years. For every serf who died after the investigation, the landlord had to pay taxes for him until the next census cancellation. An opportunist, Chichikov, saw a profit to be made and took advantage of this loophole. He took a small amount of money and went around buying lists of dead serfs. The landlords were also happy to sell the dead serfs, which not only saved them from paying taxes, but also gave them money. Chichikov bought a batch of dead serfs and also bought some bad land at a low price. He mortgaged these receipts to the bank and received a large sum of money.

    Gogol used the brush of a talented artist to present a series of landlords and bureaucrats to the reader. The terrible festering sores of Russian life were exposed to the fullest extent. This was the first comprehensive, large-scale, vivid, and in-depth exposure of the dark reality in Russian literature. Gogol read the first few chapters of this book to Pushkin. The great poet listened and laughed, but his face became more and more gloomy later. When Gogol finished reading, Pushkin said: "My God, how bleak our Russia is!"

    Although the dead serfs in the book are called "dead souls," the real "dead souls" that the readers understand are those dehumanized bureaucrats and landlords. This book was a major gain in the history of 19th-century Russian literature. It became a powerful weapon for revolutionary fighters to attack the aristocracy, bureaucrats, and landlord regime. The entire progressive social stratum of Russia, after reading this work, saw the victory of truth and the victory of realistic art. Belinsky said: "Gogol was the first to boldly face the reality of Russia."

    The outstanding master of critical realism gave a fatal blow to the autocratic monarchy and the serf system with his talented works. He hated the ugly and corrupt bureaucratic landlord-dominated society to the extreme. But in his later years, he deviated from the path of realism. He believed that the ruling class could lay down their butcher knives and reform themselves. In this case, his mental state fell into extreme distress. In the summer of 1845, he burned the completed chapters of the second part of "Dead Souls." In the "Selected Passages from Correspondence with Friends" he compiled in 1846, he even openly supported the serf system and the autocratic monarchy. This aroused dissatisfaction from the progressive society, and even his most trusted people, such as Belinsky, stood up to condemn him.

    After returning to China in 1848, he continued to write the second part of "Dead Souls" in Moscow. But his mental contradictions and suffering intensified. On March 4, 1852, he left the world in great pain.

    At the end of "Dead Souls," the author revealed his infinite bright confidence in the future Russia. He used the lyrical tone of romanticism to compare Russia to a bold, uncatchable, galloping troika: "...Russia, where are you rushing to, give an answer! You don't say a word... The air is roaring and solidifying as if shattered by the wind; it has passed everything that lives and moves on the earth; all other countries and peoples retreat from you, flashing aside to give you way."

    The great Russia, "possessing such incredible power," under the leadership of the wise revolutionary teachers Lenin and Stalin, went through the storm of the October Revolution and ran towards the bright avenue of socialism-communism, the most glorious in the world. The dark phenomena that he hated and criticized during his lifetime have been completely cleared away here.

    The Soviet Union attaches great importance to Gogol's artistic talent and the power of the vivid typical characters he created. The reality of these works and characters has become an extremely sharp weapon in the daily struggle. Lenin and Stalin constantly quoted Gogol in the struggle against the enemy. Lenin especially liked to mention the archetype of Manilov in "Dead Souls." This is a representative of utopians, a person who holds a passive and generous attitude towards reality. When the Populists attempted to save the rural poor by opening savings departments or trust departments in the countryside, Lenin, in response to this harmful and reactionary tendency, said: "Manilov sits in the heart of every Populist," "These are Manilov's words," "Manilov's Utopia"...

    In his report "On the Draft Constitution of the Soviet Union" at the Eighth Soviet Congress, Stalin compared the critics of the bourgeois constitution to the gatekeeper of a landlord in "Dead Souls." This girl gave Chichikov directions, but she herself could not even distinguish the direction of the left and right. What an appropriate, vivid, and powerful metaphor!

    In short, the typical characters created by Gogol have become common nouns. Many of his sentences have become everyday maxims. His works, as far as "The Inspector General" is concerned, have never left the stage for more than a hundred years. This year, on his centenary, his plays will be staged all over the Soviet Union, and his works will be published in more than 7.5 million copies in the Soviet Union.

    From the Opium War to the founding of New China, during this period, China was under the dual oppression of imperialism and feudal forces, and darkness and corruption reached their extreme. Gogol's works are like a bright mirror hanging high, just right for illuminating the ugly face of old China, "piercing the abscesses of society," arousing people's hatred, and promoting the development of the revolutionary movement. The first person to pay attention to Gogol here was Lu Xun, whom Chairman Mao called "the greatest and most heroic standard-bearer of the modern Chinese 'new cultural army.'" With the purpose of "drawing lessons from Russia," as early as 1907, he noticed Gogol: "In the early 19th century, there was Gogol who rose up, using invisible tearful colors to stir his people..."

    Lu Xun paid great attention to the social role of Gogol's literature in "stirring his people." Because at that time, Lu Xun, who was full of enthusiasm, also wanted to use literature to cure the numbness of Chinese society and inspire the Chinese people's will to revolution. In his article "How I Started Writing Novels," he recalled that before the May Fourth Movement, when he was collecting foreign literary works for "New Youth" in preparation for introducing them to Chinese readers, he said: "Because the works sought were shouting and resistance, it was bound to tend towards Eastern Europe, so I especially read the works of writers from Russia, Poland, and the small Balkan countries... I remember that the author I loved to read the most at that time was the Russian Gogol..."

    At that time, Lu Xun published his own works in "New Youth." He said: "From May 1918, 'Diary of a Madman,' 'Kong Yiji,' 'Medicine,' and so on, appeared successively, which can be regarded as showing the actual results of the 'literary revolution.' Moreover, because it was considered 'deeply expressive and particularly formatted' at that time, it aroused the hearts of some young readers. However, this excitement was due to the past neglect of introducing European continental literature. Around 1834, the Russian Gogol had already written 'Diary of a Madman'... But the later 'Diary of a Madman' was intended to expose the evils of the family system and ethics, which was more profound and broad than Gogol's worries..."

    (Complete Works of Lu Xun, Volume 6, pages 241-242).

    Lu Xun deeply loved Russian literature, and among Russian writers, Gogol had the greatest influence on Lu Xun. Lu Xun was influenced by him, which made him more deeply explore the dark depths of Chinese society and dissect the source of the people's suffering. Lu Xun had a very high evaluation of Gogol. In "Almost Nothing Tragedy", he talked about "Dead Souls" and said: "...The roles created are really vivid. Even now, even if the times are different and the countries are different, we still seem to meet some familiar people. The skill of satire is not to be discussed here. Just talk about the unique thing, especially in using ordinary things and ordinary words to deeply show the boring life of the landlords at that time. For example, Rostrilov in the fourth chapter is a local rogue-style landlord, likes to join in the fun, loves gambling, tells big lies, and wants to be flattered... We can still meet him at any time now... These extremely ordinary or simply nearly uneventful tragedies, like silent words, are not easy to detect unless a poet draws its image. However, people perish from the special tragedies of heroes are few, and more are consumed by extremely ordinary or simply nearly uneventful tragedies." This is Lu Xun's profound judgment on Gogol. He said that Gogol's characters are "lifelike."

    Lu Xun attached great importance to "Dead Souls" and spent a lot of effort in his later years to introduce it to China. Only his writing ability could be competent for translating such a masterpiece. Soviet comrade Rogov commented on Lu Xun's translation of "Dead Souls," believing that "Lu Xun is good at conveying the life of Russian serf society to Chinese readers in such an expressive and authentic way that the readers of the Chinese translation of 'Dead Souls' can see in the characters such as Chichikov... covered in the dust of history, familiar characters in the life of Chinese feudal landlord society." This is also the social factor that Gogol is welcomed in China.

    Gogol is universally valued in China. Since his "The Inspector General" was published in China in 1921, almost all of his important works have been introduced to China in the past 30 years. Comrade Qu Qiubai also translated "The Servants' Quarters" from Russian in 1921. So far, according to incomplete statistics, such as "The Portrait," "The Overcoat," "The Quarrel of the Two Ivans," "The Gamblers," "The Servants' Quarters," etc., there are two translations, and "The Inspector General," "Marriage," "Taras Bulba," "Diary of a Madman," etc., all have three translations. And the most influential are "The Inspector General" and "Dead Souls." The vast number of readers are spreading these works. From Gogol's mirror, they more clearly recognized the dark side of the old China, aroused disgust, and strengthened their determination to wash away these stains. Especially "The Inspector General," Chinese readers not only read it as a precious literary work, but also used different names such as "Imperial Envoy" and "Inspection Commissioner" to perform in Shanghai (winter of 1935), Nanjing (spring of 1936), Chengdu (1938), Chongqing (1942) and other major cities, which was welcomed by the vast audience. This not only affected the audience, but also affected the creation of playwrights. Recently, Comrade Chen Baichen wrote in a letter: "I love Gogol's works very much. His 'The Inspector General' was performed in Shanghai in 1935 and gave me a huge impact. This impact is reflected in many of my comedies, especially in the play 'Chart of Official Advancement.'"

    "The Inspector General" was not only performed in major cities in China, but also adapted into the film "Carnival Night" by Comrade Shi Dongshan, which was screened all over the country for three or four years. This is not accidental. This fact shows that the vast Chinese audience saw the abscesses of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule on the stage and screen. This is exactly what Lu Xun said that Gogol's bitter smile is still useful in other countries, "because there are still many shadows of living people hidden in it."

    Gogol's bitter smile is indeed a remarkable force, and it has an amazing blasting effect. In those years, all the masks of the Russian bureaucratic landlord rule were peeled off when they encountered this bitter smile. This power is not limited by any era or geographical conditions. Wherever ugliness exists, his bitter smile will have a blasting effect and bring these ugliness forever incurable wounds. This is the author's great contribution to mankind.

    Gogol has been dead for a hundred years, but his works still have a significant political and educational role today. It not only enables people to correctly understand the true situation of Russian history, but also allows them to understand many aspects of modern capitalist life through it. Gogol's characters, these bloodsuckers of the Chichikov type, these greedy roots that plunder others to enrich themselves, not only exist everywhere in capitalist society, but are even more rampant and insidious. The working people who groan in modern capitalist society seem to be free on the surface, as if they are not bought and sold like cattle and horses in Gogol's era, but in essence, their labor and their talents are also the targets of capitalists' speculation. The financial groups and giant thieves of the imperialist countries are essentially the unworthy descendants of Chichikov. Belinsky had long said: "...They are still those Chichikovs, but they are wearing different clothes: in the 'free' parliamentary elections in France and England, they buy not dead souls, but living souls!... The scoundrels in Congress are much more knowledgeable than the scoundrels in the local courts; but in essence, none of them are better than the other." ("Literary Conversations Heard in Bookstores")

    Chernyshevsky also said: "In France, as in other places, there are their own Manilovs and Chichikovs... In England, Chichikovs run factories and stock exchange deals..." ("A Brief Overview of Russian Literature in Gogol's Era").

    The essence of Chichikov is to harm others to benefit oneself, to seek profit, to speculate, and to be despicable and treacherous. This kind of thinking spreads like wildfire in capitalist society. Especially the giant thieves on Wall Street are all wearing Chichikov's coats. They not only do not know their motherland, disregard the people, do not have conscience, and do not want the precious culture of mankind, but are even more cruel and shameless than Chichikov by a thousand times. They are preparing to push mankind into the fiery pit of a new war! They even spread bacteria in Korea! These are truly beasts in human skin.

    Gogol's satirical works full of social content once served as a powerful weapon in the Russian people's liberation struggle, giving a fatal blow to the autocratic monarchy and the serf system. At present, our people across the country are responding to the call of the wise Chairman Mao and launching a storm-like anti-corruption struggle, fiercely attacking the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie. Especially in the struggle to eradicate the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie, as well as opposing the conspiracy of the war-mongers of American imperialism to provoke a new war, Gogol's works, especially "The Inspector General" and "Dead Souls," are very useful to us. The rotten abscesses of the bourgeoisie and the ugly faces of the American imperialists with human skin and animal faces make us recognize them more clearly in the mirror created by the great Russian artist. This is precisely the target to which our firepower should be concentrated. We must resolutely eliminate the murderous bacteria spread by the beasts in human skin. With the same determination, we will eliminate the invisible bacteria that poison us - the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie.

    果戈理百年忌
    曹靖华
    和普希金齐名的十九世纪前半期俄罗斯批判的现实主义文学的奠基人果戈理，逝世已经整整一百年了。去年世界和平大会理事会决议全世界人民隆重地纪念他，这在加强各国人民间的文化联系和争取世界和平的斗争中，具有世界性的政治教育意义。
    果戈理于一八○九年四月一日生于南俄波尔达瓦省密尔戈洛德县的梭洛琴茨村。父亲是一个不很富的地主，颇有文学才能，曾用乌克兰文写过剧本和诗。母亲出身贵族。果戈理在这荒僻的小地方，度过了童年。乌克兰的习尚、景物，都给他留下了难灭的印象。他很爱故乡的民歌、故事和丰富的乌克兰语言。这些都成了他后来所写的一些关于乌克兰的作品题材的来源。同时，果戈理也喜欢俄国文学，喜欢演剧，而且演得很出色，他以后的写剧的兴趣也就从这时生了根。他自幼就受到普希金思想的影响，希望将来为祖国能多尽一些力量。
    一八二八年果戈理在涅任中学毕业后，到了彼得堡，想到机关服务，结果却很失望。他耳闻目见，都是营营苟苟，卑鄙无耻的现象。差事既找不来，生活也陷入了极度的困境。不得已，曾想去当演员。一八二九年才找到一个小职员的工作。可是他不久就明白这样的环境，这样的工作，对俄罗斯不会有任何益处的。
    一八三一年初，他放弃了这差事，到女子高等学校当了一个时期的教员。这时，他结识了当代作家茹科夫斯基和大诗人普希金。尤其是普希金，对果戈理未来文学的成就上是起了很大作用的。
    果戈理幼时就爱好文学，在中学读书时，就开始写作，但那不过是些最初的尝试。他和普希金相识以后，大诗人就仔细注意到这位青年作家的才能，尤其重视他那“善于揣测人，而且能突如其来的疏疏的几笔，就刻绘出来一个活生生的形象”的才能。一八三一年，他出了“夜晚集”第一集，受到读者的欢迎。普希金在一封信中说：“这是多么坦率、自然、真实的愉快呵……有些地方是多么富于诗意，富于情感呵！这是我们文学上极不平凡的事……”
    普希金是果戈理最崇拜的人，大诗人的赞语，对果戈理是特别珍贵的。果戈理长时期所找的为祖国服务的道路，到现在真正找到了。这道路就是创作。
    一八三二年又出版了“夜晚集”第二集。这两个集子都是写乌克兰生活的。故乡的风土、人物、民歌、故事、历史事迹以及果戈理童年时所生息其间的自然环境，都非常熟悉地亲切地被描写着。笑和愁，谑和惧，当代和既往，锐敏的现实的观察和大胆的幻想的创造，都交融在这些作品里。现实的，世态的摹写和浪漫的故事式的叙述，紧紧地交织在一起。字里行间洋溢着深厚的对祖国的爱，对人民的爱。
    彼得堡的生活，对果戈理展开了一个新的视野。他除了和一些作家、学者、演员、艺术家交往外，耳闻目见，都是狐鼠成群，贿赂公行，尼古拉第一时代的一切残暴黑暗现象，都赤裸裸地暴露在他面前。彼得堡的新环境，把乌克兰的旧印象逐渐冲淡了。一八三六年他给普希金写信说：“外省影子，在我脑中已经淡下去了……可是彼得堡的生活，在我眼前却非常显明，它的色泽，在我脑子里生动而强烈地映现着。”
    果戈理就在这儿吸取了形象，选择了色调，写了一些严酷统治下的以繁华的彼得堡生活为题材的作品：“聂夫斯基大街”“肖像”“狂人日记”“鼻子”“外套”等。
    俄国有一句谚语：“容貌不端，就别怨镜子。”
    尼古拉第一时代，那严酷是无比的。他要大刀阔斧地把民主自由的一切根苗完全斩除。一八二五年十二月党人的被处死刑，就是明显的例子。人民的言论自由早被剥夺净尽。文学，尤其是讽刺文字，成了先进作家从侧面对现实表达意见的唯一的工具。果戈理在一八三三年的时候，就想写一部“好像镜子似的喜剧”，把当时俄罗斯的丑容照出来。这计划就在一八三五年所写的“巡按”里实现了。
    这本书是写一个过路的赌棍，在穷途末路中，冒充作巡按。这故事原是普希金告诉他的。果戈理在这儿把官场中一切丑态：卑鄙、骄横、贪污、行贿、造谣生事、昏瞆糊涂等等的怪状，作了猛烈的批判，给了热辣的嘲讽。这一面喜剧的镜子，照出了俄罗斯的奇形怪状的“歪容”，使当时社会受到极大的震惊。一八三六年这剧本第一次公演后，果戈理给演员柴普金的信上说：“一切人都在反对我。官僚……警察……商人……作家……都在反对我……现在我看到喜剧作家的意义了。稍微有一点真理的影子，就对你群起而攻之了，而且不是一个人，而是整个的社会呵。”
    实际上，当时群起而攻之的，不是整个的社会，而是最反动的统治阶级。果戈理在进步社会层的心目中，却受到狂热的欢呼和无上的崇敬。当时他注意到的，不过只是反动集团的攻击罢了。这结果，使他受到很大的刺激，遂于一八三六年出国去了。他到了德国、瑞士、巴黎。一八三七年到了罗马，他很喜欢这地方，就决定长住下去。在国外继续写他于一八三五年就已经开始了的巨作“死魂灵”。
    普希金早就劝果戈理写大部的著作。“死魂灵”的故事，也是普希金告诉他的。在农奴制度下，地主不但拥有土地，而且拥有土地上的农奴。这些农奴被称为“魂灵”。他们好像畜牲似的，可以同土地一起被买卖。地主所有农奴的数目，每十年国家要调查一次。凡在调查后每一个身亡的农奴，地主都要替他纳税，直到下次查奴注销为止。一个投机家乞乞科夫，觉得有利可图，就钻了这个空子。他带了少数的钱，到处收购死农奴的名单。地主也都乐意出售死农奴，这样不但可免纳税，而且又可得钱。乞乞科夫收购了一批死农奴，又贱价购了一些坏地。就把这些单据抵押到银行里，得到一大笔钱。
    果戈理用天才的艺术家的画笔，把一系列的地主、官僚，都陈列到读者面前。俄国生活的可怕的浓疮，都淋漓尽致地被暴露出来。这是俄国文学上第一次全面的、大规模的、生动而深入的黑暗现实的大暴露。果戈理曾把这本书的前几章读给普希金听，大诗人听着，笑着，可是到后来面色越来越阴沉了。果戈理一读完的时候，普希金就说：“天呀，我们的俄罗斯是多么惨淡呵！”
    书中虽把死去的农奴称为“死魂灵”，可是读者所了解的真正的“死魂灵”，却是那些丧尽人性的官僚、地主。这部书是十九世纪俄国文学史上重大的收获，它成了革命战士打击贵族、官僚、地主政权的有力的武器。俄罗斯整个的进步的社会阶层，读了这部作品，看到了真理的胜利，现实主义艺术的胜利。柏林斯基说：“果戈理是第一个大胆地正视了俄罗斯的现实。”
    杰出的批判的现实主义的大师，用自己的天才的作品，对君主专制和农奴制度给了致命的打击。他对那丑恶而腐朽的官僚地主统治下的社会痛恶到极点。可是他到了晚年却离开了现实主义的道路。他相信统治阶级可以放下屠刀，革面洗心。在这种情况下，他的精神状态陷于极度的苦恼。一八四五年夏天，他竟把“死魂灵”第二部的已写成的几章手稿，付之一炬。在一八四六年他编的“通信选集”中，更公然地拥护农奴制度和君主专制政体。这引起了进步社会的不满，甚至最亲信的人，如柏林斯基，都起来责难他。
    一八四八年他回国后，在莫斯科又继续写“死魂灵”第二部。但他精神上的矛盾和苦恼更加剧烈，于一八五二年三月四日，在万分苦痛中离开人间。
    在“死魂灵”的结尾里，作者流露着对未来的俄罗斯的无限光明的信心，他用浪漫主义的抒情的音调，把俄罗斯比作大胆的、追不上的、飞奔着的三驾马车：“……俄罗斯呵，你奔到那里去，给一个回答！你一声也不响……好像被风所搅碎似的，空气在咆哮，在凝结；超过了凡在地上生活和动弹的一切，涌过去了；所有别的国度和国民，都对你退避，闪在一旁，让给你道路。”
    伟大的“蓄着多么不可思议的力量的”俄罗斯，在英明的革命导师列宁和斯大林领导下，穿过了十月革命的风暴，奔向人间最光辉的社会主义——共产主义的康庄大道。他生前所痛恶、所抨击的黑暗现象，在这儿完全廓清了。
    苏联对于果戈理的艺术天才，对他所塑造的生动的典型人物的力量，是异常重视的。这些作品和人物的现实性，成了日常生活斗争中极锋利的武器。列宁和斯大林在同敌人斗争中，都不断引用果戈理。列宁尤其喜欢提到“死魂灵”中的玛尼罗夫的典型。这是一种空想家的代表，对现实抱着消极的宽宏大量的人物。当民粹派企图在农村以开办储蓄部或信托部来拯救农村穷困的时候，列宁就针对着这种有害的反动倾向说：“玛尼罗夫坐在每一个民粹派分子的心里”，“这些都是玛尼罗夫的话”，“玛尼罗夫的空想”……
    斯大林在第八次苏维埃大会上“关于苏联宪法草案”的报告中，把资产阶级的宪法批评家，比作“死魂灵”中一个地主的看门的姑娘，这姑娘给乞乞科夫指示道路，可是她自己却连左右的方向都辨不清。这是多么恰当、生动而有力的比喻！
    总之，果戈理所塑造的典型人物，都成了普通名词。他的好多语句，都成了日常习用的格言。他的著作，就“巡按”而言，一百多年以来，就没有下过舞台。今年在他百年忌辰，他的剧本将在苏联各地上演，他的作品将在苏联出版七百五十多万册。

    从鸦片战争起，直到新中国成立前，这期间，中国处在帝国主义和封建势力双重压迫下，黑暗腐败，达于极点。果戈理的著作，恰如明镜高悬，正好借它来照一下旧中国的丑容，“刺破社会的脓疮”，激发人民的痛恶，促进革命运动的开展。在这里，首先注意到果戈理的，是毛主席所称的现代中国“文化新军的最伟大与最英勇的旗手”鲁迅。他抱着“从俄国借鉴”的目的，远在一九○七年就注意到果戈理：“十九世纪前叶，果有果戈理者起，以不可见的泪痕悲色，振其邦人……”
    鲁迅十分注意果戈理的“振其邦人”的文学的社会作用。因为当时怀着满腔热诚的鲁迅，也正是要借文学来医治中国社会的麻木，振奋中国人民革命的意志的。他在“我怎样做起小说来”一文中，回忆到他在“五四”以前替“新青年”搜集外国文学作品预备介绍给中国读者时，说：“因为所求的作品是叫喊和反抗，势必至于倾向了东欧，因此所看的俄国、波兰以及巴尔干诸小国作家的东西就特别多……记得当时最爱看的作者，是俄国的果戈理……”
    当时鲁迅在“新青年”上发表了自己的创作。他说：“从一九一八年五月起，‘狂人日记’‘孔乙己’‘药’等，陆续的出现了，算是显示了‘文学革命’的实绩，又因那时的认为‘表现的深切和格式的特别’，颇激动了一部分青年读者的心。然而这激动，却是向来怠慢了介绍欧洲大陆文学的缘故。一八三四年顷，俄国的果戈理就已经写了‘狂人日记’……但后起的‘狂人日记’，意在暴露家族制度和礼教的弊害，却比果戈理的忧愤深广……”
    （鲁迅全集卷六，页二四一——二四二）。
    鲁迅是深爱俄罗斯文学的，而俄罗斯作家之中，对鲁迅影响最大的，首推果戈理。鲁迅受到他的影响，使他更深入地探视中国社会黑暗的深层，剖解人民疾苦的病源。鲁迅对果戈理是有极高评价的，他在“几乎无事的悲剧”中，谈及“死魂灵”说：“……那创作出来的脚色，可真生动极了，直到现在，纵使时代不同，国度不同，也还使我们像是遇见了有些熟识的人物。讽刺的本领，在这里不及谈，单说那独特之处，尤其是在用平常事、平常话，深刻的显出当时地主的无聊生活。例如第四章里的罗士特来夫，是地方恶少式的地主，赶热闹，爱赌博，撒大谎，要恭维……是我们现在还随时可以遇见的……这些极平常的，或者简直近于没有事情的悲剧，正如无声的言语一样，非由诗人画出它的形象来，是很不容易觉察的。然而人们灭亡于英雄的特别的悲剧者少，消磨于极平常的，或者简直近于没有事情的悲剧者却多。”这是鲁迅对果戈理的深刻的论断。他说果戈理的人物都是“栩栩如生”的。
    鲁迅非常重视“死魂灵”，而且晚年费了不少心血把它介绍到中国来。翻译这样的名著，也只有他的笔力才能胜任。苏联罗果夫同志谈及鲁迅的“死魂灵”的译本时，认为“鲁迅善于这样富有表现力的和真切的把俄罗斯农奴社会生活传达给中国读者，以致于‘死魂灵’中译本的读者，在我们看来，能在蒙着历史灰尘的乞乞科夫……等的人物中，看出了中国封建地主社会生活中的熟悉人物。”这也正是果戈理在中国受到欢迎的社会因素。
    果戈理在中国是受到普遍重视的。自从一九二一年他的“巡按”在中国出版后，三十年来，他的重要著作，几乎全被介绍到中国来。瞿秋白同志在一九二一年也曾从俄文译过“仆御室”。到现在为止，据不完全的统计，如：“肖像”、“外套”、“两个伊凡的吵架”、“赌徒”、“仆御室”等，都有两种译本，“巡按”、“婚事”、“搭拉斯·布尔巴”、“狂人日记”等，都有三个译本。而影响最大的是“巡按”和“死魂灵”。广大读者都在传诵着这些作品。他们从果戈理的镜子里，更清楚地认清了中国旧时代的黑暗面，激起了厌恶的心情，加强洗涤这些污垢的决心。尤其是“巡按”，中国读者不但把它当作宝贵的文艺作品读，而且用“钦差大臣”、“视察专员”等不同的名称，在上海（一九三五年冬）、南京（一九三六年春）、成都
    （一九三八年）、重庆（一九四二年）及其他大城市公演，曾受到广大观众的欢迎。这不但影响到观众，而且影响到剧作家的创作。最近陈白尘同志来信说：“果戈理的作品，是我所酷爱的，他的‘钦差大臣’一九三五年在上海演出，给了我巨大影响。这影响表现在我许多喜剧，特别是在‘升官图’那个剧本里。”
    “巡按”不但在中国各大城市演出，而且由史东山同志改编为电影“狂欢之夜”，在全国各地放映了三四年之久。这不是偶然的。这一个事实说明了中国广大观众，在舞台和银幕上，看见了国民党反动统治的脓疮。这也就恰如鲁迅所说的果戈理的苦笑，在别的国度里，也依然有用，“因为其中还藏着许多活人的影子”。
    果戈理的苦笑，的确是了不起的一种力量，它起着惊人的爆破作用。当年俄罗斯官僚地主统治的一切假面具，碰到这苦笑都剥落了。这力量是任何时代和地理条件都限制不住的。凡有丑恶存在的地方，他这苦笑就会起爆破作用，就会给这些丑恶带来永远不治的创伤。这正是作者对人类的大贡献。
    果戈理逝世一百年了，可是他的作品，在今天还有重大的政治教育的作用。它不但使人正确地了解到俄罗斯历史的真实情况，而且还可以通过它了解现代资本主义的好多生活面。果戈理的人物，这些乞乞科夫之流的吸血鬼们，这些掠夺别人以自肥的贪婪的根性，在资本主义社会中，不但到处存在，而且更其猖狂、阴毒。呻吟于现代资本主义社会中的劳动人民，表面上好像是自由的，好像不是果戈理时代被人同牛马一样买卖，可是实质上，他们的劳动，他们的才能，同样是资本家投机的对象。帝国主义国家的财阀、巨盗，实质上都是乞乞科夫的肖子贤孙。柏林斯基早就说过：“……依然是那些乞乞科夫之流，不过是穿着另样的服装：他们在法国和英国‘自由的’国会选举上，收买的不是死魂灵，而是活魂灵！……国会中的混蛋同地方法院中的混蛋比较起来，要有学问得多；而实质上，他们谁也不比谁好。”（“在书店里听到的文学谈话”）
    车尔尼雪夫斯基也说：“在法国，和在其他各地一样，都有他们自己的玛尼罗夫们和乞乞科夫们……在英国，乞乞科夫们经营着工厂和交易所的勾当……（“果戈理时代俄国文学概略”）。
    乞乞科夫的本质，就是损人利己，唯利是图，投机取巧，卑鄙险诈。这种思想，野火燎原似地在资本主义社会里蔓延着。尤其是华尔街的巨盗们，都披着乞乞科夫的外衣，他们不但不知祖国，不顾人民，不要良心，不要人类宝贵的文化，而且比乞乞科夫更残忍千万倍，无耻千万倍，他们正准备把人类往新战争的火坑里推！他们竟在朝鲜撒布细菌！这是一些真正披着人皮的野兽。
    果戈理的充满社会内容的辛辣的讽刺作品，在俄罗斯人民的解放斗争中，曾经作为有力的武器，给君主专制和农奴制度作了致命的痛击。目前，我们全国人民响应着英明的毛主席的号召，狂风骤雨似地展开了反贪污斗争，痛击资产阶级的猖狂进攻，尤其在根绝资产阶级腐朽思想的斗争上，以及反对美帝国主义战争贩子挑拨新战争的阴谋上，果戈理的著作，尤其是“巡按”和“死魂灵”，对我们是非常有用的。资产阶级腐烂的脓疮及人皮野兽的美帝国主义的嘴脸，使我们在俄罗斯大艺术家所创造的镜子里，认识得更清楚。这正是我们的火力所要集中的目标。我们要坚决消灭人皮野兽所散布的杀人细菌，我们以同样的决心，来消灭毒害我们的无形的细菌——资产阶级的腐朽思想。
