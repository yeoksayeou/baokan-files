Smash the Bourgeoisie's Frenzied Attack on Trade Union Organizations
Jiang Heng

For the past three years, an important aspect of the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack on the working class has been a planned and systematic attack on trade union organizations, attempting to usurp the leadership of the unions. This situation is particularly widespread and serious in private factories and shops.

The bourgeoisie's methods of attacking trade union organizations include actively "organizing" or "participating" in trade unions, obstructing and undermining workers' participation in trade unions, and using vicious methods of "sending in" and "pulling over" to usurp the leadership of the unions.

The bourgeoisie's active "organization" or "participation" in trade unions mostly occurred in the early days of liberation when trade union work had not yet been developed and the consciousness of workers and shop assistants was not high. The bourgeoisie, feigning "enlightenment," used the excuse of "we have no labor or capital, we are all one family" to confuse the issue and "organize" or "participate" in trade unions, attempting to turn the mass organizations of the working class into tools for ruling and exploiting workers. A capitalist in Tianjin once actively organized a trade union. The first proposal he made to the workers was: all personnel should participate and be led separately by managers and others. When he saw that the active elements among the staff and workers opposed this approach, he immediately proposed a second plan: you organize, and we will all participate. The Tianjin Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees' Union finally exposed the capitalist's conspiracy and made them withdraw from the union. The Wuhan Construction Workers' Union was once usurped by奸商 (treacherous merchants) Liu Shaohai and Pan Yuqing. All thirteen members of this union's committee were奸商 (treacherous merchants), capitalist agents, and running dogs of the bourgeoisie. At that time, employees had to "petition" the capitalists for "approval" to join the union; materials sent to the higher-level union also had to be "reviewed" by the capitalists first. In the anti-theft struggle, this union has been completely reorganized, and more than thirty class aliens who had infiltrated the union have been completely purged. From these two examples, it is not difficult to see how planned, organized, and frenziedly shameless the bourgeoisie's attack on trade union organizations was.

The bourgeoisie's obstruction of workers and shop assistants from joining trade unions, or their use of vicious methods of "sending in" and "pulling over" to undermine trade unions, mostly occurred after the official promulgation of the "Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China" by the Central People's Government in June 1950. At this time, the political consciousness of the working class had gradually increased, and the bourgeoisie's conspiracies and tricks of "organizing" or "participating" in trade unions could no longer be implemented.

The bourgeoisie adopted methods such as spreading rumors and slanders, sowing discord, attacking and threatening, withholding wages and dismissing employees, and establishing "contracts of indenture" to restrict workers and shop assistants from joining trade unions and undermine the prestige of trade unions. Many illegal capitalists spread rumors saying: "Joining the trade union means running around paying taxes, wearing more shoes, and suffering more." Some illegal capitalists said to the trade union cadres: "The workers here are all backward and cannot join the trade union"; on the other hand, they deceived the workers by saying: "What kind of workers are you? Only railway workers are workers!" However, the vast majority of workers still demanded to join the trade union. At this time, illegal capitalists used the method of "dismissal" to threaten workers. Many trade union members were dismissed by illegal capitalists in this way. For example, the Tianjin Hengtong Iron Factory had only 25 workers in the entire factory, but in the past three years, more than 80 trade union members were illegally dismissed by the capitalists. The Tianjin Qixin "Model" Iron Factory had a cumulative total of more than 40 trade union members dismissed by the capitalists, more than three times the number of workers in the entire factory.

In order to obstruct workers and shop assistants from joining trade unions, some illegal capitalists even forced workers and shop assistants to sign "contracts of indenture," such as filling out "employment guarantees" stating "not to join the trade union" and "voluntary applications for temporary work" as "conditions" for employment. Qian Lijun, the capitalist of the Shanghai Raincoat Factory, once forced the old worker Bai Baokang to fill out such an "employment guarantee":

"To whom it may concern: Bai Baokang is grateful for being hired. During the period of employment, he voluntarily agrees not to join the Raincoat Workers' Union as a member..."

This kind of feudal and barbaric treatment of workers and shop assistants is quite common in private enterprises, only some capitalists have changed the form. In Chahar Province and Harbin City, many capitalists, when hiring workers, either "use long-term workers for short-term jobs" or force workers to fill out "voluntary applications for temporary work" in order to deprive workers of their political rights.

The most vicious method of the bourgeoisie's attack on trade union organizations is to "send in" capitalist agents and "pull over" trade union cadres in order to corrupt trade union organizations and seize the leadership of the trade unions. Materials from many places show that many of those "sent in" by the bourgeoisie are "managers," "bosses," or their relatives, and these spies often seize the important position of "chairman" of the trade union. In the Jinan Handicraft Industry Union, there are more than 30 capitalists; in the first branch of the Construction Industry Union, there are three managers and three feudal foremen among the nine standing committee members. Most of those who are "pulled over" are trade union chairmen of a certain industry or a certain factory. Many of these people who have been "pulled over" were once very good workers, but under the vicious attacks of bribery, enticement, salary increases, stock shares, and "honey traps" by the bourgeoisie, they degenerated and transformed into traitors who sold out the interests of the working class. The capitalist of Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory bribed Xie Yousheng, the former chairman of the factory's trade union, four times. The capitalist of Tianjin Continental Rubber Factory gave salary increases and promotions to nine (all) trade union committee members. The manager of the Fujian Paper Mill instructed his cousin to seduce Wang Siyuan, the chairman of the trade union. These are just individual examples among thousands of cases.

The purpose of the bourgeoisie's usurpation of trade unions is extremely vicious. The bourgeoisie uses the running dogs it has bought off to resist the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, to freely exploit and enslave workers, and to steal state property on a large scale. Some trade union organizations were originally very pure, but the leadership was controlled by a small number of impure elements or traitors; some trade union organizations are ostensibly organizations of the working class, but in reality, they have become tools for stealing state property on a large scale. These trade union organizations or their leaders are either deaf to the illegal behavior of capitalists or help them. The most typical example is Shen Sizhong, the chairman of the Shanghai Shisheng Rubber Factory's trade union and the capitalist's "mole." Using his position, he not only helped the capitalist reduce wages by 21 percent, but also forced workers to sign a "break-even self-sufficiency contract" that stated "no wages will be paid if there is a loss," and extended working hours to more than 18 hours. Some workers became ill or died due to overwork. Many "trade union" organizations whose leadership was usurped by capitalists even falsely used the name to "guarantee" that capitalists could legally steal state property. The "trade unions" of Shanghai Shisheng Rubber Factory and Tianjin Dagong Dyeing Factory even issued "guarantees" for capitalists and "fought lawsuits" for capitalists. This situation is quite common in private factories and shops in many places.

Trade union organizations are weapons that represent the interests of workers and fight against the bourgeoisie, and they are pillars of the people's democratic government. In private enterprises, they have the task of supervising capitalists to earnestly implement all laws and decrees promulgated by the government and protect the fundamental interests of the working class. It should "educate and organize the masses of workers and staff, uphold the laws of the People's Government, and promote the policies of the People's Government, in order to consolidate the people's power led by the working class." (Trade Union Law) However, trade unions whose leadership has been usurped by the bourgeoisie have completely embarked on the opposite path. This is something that we should be highly vigilant about.

In the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle, many local trade unions have mobilized workers and shop assistants to launch a counterattack against the bourgeoisie's offensive. Trade union organizations have gradually been purified and expanded in this intense struggle. However, there are still many trade union cadres who, in the past, neglected the principle of "seeking unity through struggle" in their relationship with the bourgeoisie, and still do not fully understand the harm and seriousness of the bourgeoisie's attack on trade union organizations. Therefore, they are either "afraid of shifting the focus of work" and dare not let go of mobilizing workers and shop assistants to fight against illegal capitalists, or they are "afraid of collapsing the organization" and "afraid of not having cadres," and condone those "moles" and traitors who have infiltrated the trade union organization. Facts have proved that smashing the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack on trade union organizations is not only the urgent demand of the vast majority of workers and shop assistants, but also that a large number of excellent cadres and activists will inevitably emerge in the struggle to eliminate class aliens who have infiltrated the trade union. Therefore, trade unions in various places, especially trade union organizations in private enterprises, must overcome right-leaning thinking and resolutely eliminate those capitalists and their confidants and henchmen who have infiltrated the trade union; for those trade union cadres who have been pulled over by the bourgeoisie, those whose circumstances are not very serious should be asked to confess and examine themselves and correct their mistakes; those class traitors who refuse to confess or are incorrigible must be resolutely eliminated. Only by completely eliminating class aliens from trade union cadres, only by victoriously smashing the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack on trade union organizations, can we purify the ranks of the working class, fully exert the combat effectiveness of trade union organizations, and consolidate the leadership of the working class; only then can we mobilize and lead the broad masses of workers to carry out the movement to increase production and practice thrift, and embark on the road of large-scale construction.

    粉碎资产阶级向工会组织的猖狂进攻
    江横
    三年来，资产阶级向工人阶级猖狂进攻的一个重要方面，是有计划、有步骤地进攻工会组织，篡夺工会的领导权。这种情形，在私营工厂和商店中尤其普遍严重。
    资产阶级向工会组织进攻的方式，有的是主动“组织”或“参加”工会，有的是阻挠破坏工人参加工会，有的是用“派进来”“拉过去”的恶毒方法，来篡夺工会的领导权。
    资产阶级主动“组织”或“参加”工会，多是在解放初期工会工作还没有展开、工人店员觉悟还不高的情况下发生的。资产阶级伪装“开明”，藉口“我们没有什么劳方资方，都是一家人”，来鱼目混珠地“组织”或“参加”工会，妄图把工人阶级底群众组织，变成统治剥削工人的工具。天津的一个资本家，就曾经主动地组织工会。他对工人提出的第一个方案是：全体人员参加，由经理等人分头领导。他看到职工积极分子反对这种作法，立即提出第二个方案：你们组织，我们都来参加。中国店员工会天津委员会终于戳穿了资方的阴谋，让他们退出了工会。武汉市营造业工会一度被奸商刘少海和潘玉卿所篡夺。这个工会的十三个委员，全部是奸商、资方代理人和资产阶级的走狗。那时候，职工入会都要“呈请”资方“批准”；往上级工会送的材料，也要先经资方“审核”。在反盗窃斗争中，这个工会已被彻底改组，三十多个混入工会的阶级异己分子，全被清除出去。从这两个例子中，不难看出资产阶级对于工会组织的进攻，是多么有计划、有组织和多么猖狂、无耻了。
    资产阶级阻挠工人店员参加工会，或以“派进来”“拉过去”的恶毒方法破坏工会，多是在一九五○年六月中央人民政府正式公布“中华人民共和国工会法”以后。这时工人阶级的政治觉悟已逐渐提高，资产阶级“组织”或“参加”工会的阴谋诡计，已经无法施展了。
    资产阶级采用造谣诬蔑、挑拨离间、打击威胁、扣薪解雇和强立“卖身契”等手段，限制工人店员参加工会，和破坏工会的威信。很多违法资本家造谣说：“参加工会，跑路纳税，多穿了鞋，多遭了罪。”有些违法资本家一面对工会干部说：“我们这里的工友都落后，不能参加工会”；一面又欺骗工人说：“你们算什么工人？铁路上的工人才算工人呢！”但是，广大工人还是要求参加工会，这时候，违法资本家就用“开除”的办法来威胁工人。很多工会会员，就这样被违法资本家开除了。例如，天津亨通铁工厂全厂工人不过二十五人，但三年来被资方非法开除的工会会员就有八十多人，天津启新“模范”铁工厂被资方开除的工会会员累计四十多人，超过全厂工人数目的三倍。
    有些违法资本家为了阻挠工人店员参加工会，竟强迫工人、店员订立“卖身契”，例如，填写“不参加工会”的“就业保证书”、“临时工自愿书”等，作为雇佣的“条件”。上海雨布雨衣厂资方钱立钧，就曾强迫老工人白宝康填写了这样一张“就业保证书”：
    “迳启者：晚宝康承蒙录用，在供职期内，自愿决不参加雨衣职工会为会员。……”
    这种用封建野蛮的手段对待工人店员的情况在私营企业中是相当普遍的，只不过有些资本家换了个形式而已。察哈尔省和哈尔滨市有很多资本家雇佣工人时，不是“长工短用”，就是逼迫工人填写“临时工自愿书”，以剥夺工人的政治权利。
    资产阶级进攻工会组织的最恶毒的方法，是把资方代理人“派进来”，把工会干部“拉过去”，以便腐蚀工会组织，争夺工会的领导权。许多地方的材料表明，资产阶级“派进来”的很多都是“经理”“老板”或其亲属，这些奸细常常窃据了工会“主席”的要职。济南市手工业工会中，就有资本家三十多人；建筑业工会木瓦业第一分会九个常委中，就有三个经理、三个封建把头。被“拉过去”的，大部是某一行业或某一厂商的工会主席。这些被“拉过去”的人，有许多曾经是很好的工人，但在资产阶级收买利诱、加薪入股和“美人计”等恶毒进攻下，他们却堕落蜕化，变成出卖工人阶级利益的工贼了。石家庄大兴纱厂资方四次向该厂前任工会主席谢幼声行贿，天津大陆橡胶厂资方给九个工会委员（全部）加薪提升，福建造纸厂经理指使他表妹勾引工会主席王思源，这些只不过是千百件罪案中的个别例子。
    资产阶级篡窃工会的目的是非常恶毒的。资产阶级利用被它所收买的走狗，抗拒工人阶级和国营经济的领导，放手剥削、奴役工人，大规模地盗窃国家财产。有的工会组织，原是很纯洁的，但领导权为少数不纯分子或工贼所控制了；有的工会组织，表面上是工人阶级的组织，实际上成为大量盗窃国家财产的工具。这些工会组织或其领导人，对资本家的违法行为，不是充耳无闻，便是加以帮助。最典型的例子是上海实生橡胶厂工会主席、资本家的“坐探”沈思中。他利用职权，不仅先后帮助资方减薪百分之二十一，而且强制工人和资方订立了“蚀本不发工资”的“保本自给合同”，并把工时延长到十八小时以上。有些工人竟因疲劳过度累病或累死了。有不少被资本家篡夺了领导权的“工会”组织，竟假借名义，“保证”资本家合法地盗窃国家财产。上海实生橡胶厂和天津大公染厂“工会”，竟替资本家开具“保证书”，替资本家“打官司”。这种情况，在很多地方的私营工厂商店中，竟是相当普遍的。
    工会组织是代表工人利益向资产阶级进行斗争的武器，是人民民主政权的支柱，它在私营企业中，负有监督资方切实执行政府所颁布的一切法令，保护工人阶级的根本利益的任务。它应该“教育并组织工人、职员群众，维护人民政府法令，推行人民政府政策，以巩固工人阶级领导的人民政权”。（工会法）可是，被资产阶级篡夺了领导权的工会，已经完全走上与此相反的道路，这是值得我们十分警惕的。
    在反贪污反盗窃斗争中，许多地方工会，发动工人店员，对资产阶级的进攻展开了反攻。工会组织在这一紧张的斗争中，逐步纯洁了并且扩大了。但是，还有不少工会干部，他们过去在对待资产阶级的关系上，忽视了“从斗争中求团结”的方针，现在对于资产阶级向工会组织进攻的危害性和严重性，仍然认识不足。因此，他们不是“怕转移工作中心”，不敢放手发动工人店员向违法资本家斗争，便是“怕把组织整垮”，“怕没有干部”，而姑息那些混进工会组织的“坐探”和工贼。事实证明，粉碎资产阶级向工会组织的进攻，不但是广大工人店员的迫切要求，而且在清除混进工会的阶级异己分子的斗争中，必然涌现出大批的优秀干部和积极分子。因此，各地工会特别是私营企业中的工会组织，必须克服右倾思想，把那些混进工会的资本家及其亲信爪牙，坚决清除出去；对于那些被资产阶级拉过去的工会干部，凡是情节不很严重的，要他们坦白检讨，改正错误；凡是拒不坦白的或已不可救药的阶级叛徒，必须坚决清除出去。只有把工会干部中的阶级异己分子完全清除出去，只有胜利地粉碎了资产阶级向工会组织的猖狂进攻，才能纯洁工人阶级的队伍，充分发挥工会组织的战斗力，巩固工人阶级的领导权；也才能发动和领导广大的工人群众，开展增产节约运动，走上大规模建设的道路。
