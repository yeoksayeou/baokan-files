    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
    Supply Department Building Project Should Be Inspected
    Editor: During our inspection of the Fulong Construction Company, we discovered that the unscrupulous merchants of this factory were engaging in such acts as cutting corners on materials, misappropriating materials, and evading taxes. Among these, the Supply Department building project of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant was one of the biggest cases of theft by these unscrupulous merchants. However, how did the leaders of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant deal with this issue before and after the anti-corruption movement? On the wall of the construction company, there was a banner presented by the Capital Construction Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, with the words "Complete the task ahead of schedule, increase wealth for the new China!" To praise unscrupulous merchants who steal state wealth shows the seriousness of the bureaucratic work style of some cadres in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. When we sent people to contact the Supply Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, a comrade surnamed Ma said, "Our scale is large, and we don't have time to take care of such 'small' problems." However, according to the results of our inspection, this is by no means a "small" problem. The initial findings show that the unscrupulous merchants have stolen over one hundred million yuan from this project by cutting corners on materials alone. We hope that the leaders of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant will not lightly dismiss these so-called "small" problems and should promptly inspect and handle them.

### 石景山钢铁厂  应检查供应课楼房工程

    石景山钢铁厂
    应检查供应课楼房工程
    编辑同志：我们检查福隆营造厂时，发现该厂奸商有偷工减料、套购物料、偷漏税款等行为。其中石景山钢铁厂供应课楼房工程是被奸商盗窃最大的一个。但石景山钢铁厂领导方面在反贪污运动前后怎样对待这个问题呢？在该营造厂的墙上，挂着一面石景山钢铁厂基本建设处赠送的锦标，上面镶着这样几个字：“提前完成任务，为新中国增加财富！”对盗窃国家财富的奸商竟加以表扬，可见石景山钢铁厂某些干部官僚主义作风的严重程度。当我们派人和石景山钢铁厂供应处联系时，该处一位姓马的同志竟说：“我们的摊子大，没有功夫顾及这样‘小’的问题。”但据我们检查的结果，证明这绝不是“小”问题，只奸商在这个工程中偷工减料一项，初步已查出的就在一亿元以上。我们希望石景山钢铁厂领导方面切勿轻轻放过所谓“小”问题，应迅速予以检查处理。
