To the Editor:
The book "Introduction to Forestry" written by Hao Jingsheng (revised edition, May 1951, published by The Commercial Press) contains many political errors.

In the third section of the second chapter of the book, the author argues that forests can determine the strength of a nation. He states: "The most famous and powerful countries in the world today all possess large areas of forests... In Europe, such as Germany and the Soviet Union; in the Americas, such as the United States and Canada; in Asia, such as Japan; the Southern Hemisphere has no large forests, therefore there are no powerful countries." He also says that China's average forest area per person is "only one one-hundred-and-fiftieth of the average forest area that a British citizen should have," and "From this, it can be seen that China is the most forest-deficient country, and among the so-called 'Four Great Powers,' China is the weakest." This viewpoint is a variant of "geographical determinism." Starting from this erroneous viewpoint, the author fully expresses his national inferiority complex.

In the fifth section of the second chapter, the author argues that forests can determine a person's character. He states: "The ferocity of the Japanese, German, and Soviet people in combat is closely related to forests." This view is even more erroneous. How can forests determine the morale of troops and the nature of war? To compare Japanese "Bushido," German "Nazism," and the Soviet Red Army is absurd! Starting from the above erroneous arguments, the author even makes remarks that violate patriotism. In the fifth section, he says: "Bare mountains stretch for thousands of miles, without a blade of grass growing. As soon as it rains heavily, mountain floods arrive... In front are loess mountains, behind are loess mountains, to the left are loess mountains, and to the right are still loess mountains. This province is like this, and other provinces are the same. To insist that such a country is lovable is simply deceiving people!" Can anyone believe that these words came from the mouth of a Chinese person?

Detached from China's socialist construction and the Chinese society, and exclusively peddling capitalist forestry theories, is the main root of the author's errors. In Chapter 17, on logging and transportation, he does not mention at all the new logging and transportation methods created by the forestry labor models of the Northeast Forestry Industry Bureau, nor the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union. In the section on logging methods, he does not mention the new logging method created by forestry labor models and promoted throughout the country, which reduces the stump height to 30 cm - 20 cm. In Chapter 6, on forest tending, he does not mention the new forest tending method of cleaning forest areas, which is being promoted in the Northeast based on advanced Soviet experiences, nor the nationwide practice of closing hillsides for afforestation. Among the 367 forestry reference books introduced by the author, books and periodicals from capitalist countries account for 239, while only one book from the Soviet Union is introduced.

There are many other erroneous views in this book. I believe these errors must be thoroughly corrected.

### “林学概论”的错误观点必须彻底纠正

    “林学概论”的错误观点必须彻底纠正
    编辑同志：郝景盛所著“林学概论”（一九五一年五月修订本、商务印书馆出版）一书，有很多政治错误。
    在该书第二章第三节中，著者认为森林可以决定国家的强弱。他说：“现在世界上最著名的富强之国，都拥有大面积之森林。……在欧洲如德国与苏联；在美洲如美国及加拿大，在亚洲如日本；南半球无大好之森林，因此亦无富强之国存在”。又说：我国每人平均森林面积“仅为英国一个国民平均应得之森林面积的一百五十分之一”，“由此看来，我国是森林最缺乏的国家，在所谓‘四大强国’中，我国是最弱之一员”。这种观点，是“地理环境决定论”的变种，从这一错误观点出发，著者充分表现出自己的民族自卑感。
    在第二章第五节中，著者认为森林可以决定人的性格，他说：“日本、德国、苏联人民，作战那样凶猛皆与森林有密切关系”。这种看法更是错误的。森林如何能决定部队的士气和战争的性质？把日本的“武士道”、德国的“纳粹”和苏联红军相提并论，这不是荒谬绝伦么？著者从上述错误论点出发，竟至发出违反爱国主义的言论。在第五节中，他说：“童山万里，寸草不生，大雨一来，山洪立至……前面是黄土山，后面是黄土山，左面是黄土山，右面还是黄土山，这省如此，他省依然，这样的国土硬说他可爱，岂非骗人！”这些话，能够相信是出自中国人之口吗？
    脱离中国社会的林业建设，专门贩卖资本主义的林业理论，是著者发生错误的主要根源，在第十七章采运学中，他对东北森林工业总局的林业劳动模范所创造的新采运法和苏联的先进经验，一点都没有提到。在伐木法中，他对林业劳动模范创造的并向全国推广的降低伐根到三○公分——二○公分的新伐法，也没有提及；第六章谈森林抚育，他对东北正在推广的苏联先进经验——清理林场的新抚育法，和全国正在推行的封山育林，也都只字不提。作者在介绍的林业文献参考书三百六十七种内，资本主义国家的书刊竟占二百三十九种，而苏联的书刊却只介绍了一种。
    这本书的错误观点还很多，我认为这些错误是必须彻底纠正的。
