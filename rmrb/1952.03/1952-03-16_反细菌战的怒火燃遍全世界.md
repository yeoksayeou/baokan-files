The flames of indignation against the American aggressors' germ warfare are raging throughout China and the world. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, all democratic parties, people's organizations, workers, farmers, soldiers, women, children, scientists, professors, students, and religious figures in our country have all condemned the barbaric and despicable crimes of the American aggressors, unanimously supported Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement, and are strengthening their practical work to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to strike back at the American aggressors. National medical, health, and scientific workers have formed a specialized committee for the prevention of germ warfare. An anti-U.S. aggression and aid Korea voluntary epidemic prevention and inspection team composed of dozens of bacteriology experts, including Professor Yang Shuya, arrived at the Korean front line on March 2 to begin work. Medical and health workers in various localities are organizing institutions to prepare for the prevention of germ warfare, and are requesting to go to the forefront of the fight against germ warfare. The 925 faculty, staff, and students of Peking University Medical College have formed a germ defense brigade, ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. More than half of the students at Northwest Medical College have written letters of determination, and more than 240 epidemic prevention workers in Chongqing have jointly requested to go to the Northeast and the Korean front line to eradicate the germs spread by the American aggressors. Medical and health workers in Wuhu are enthusiastically launching a signature campaign to volunteer for the epidemic prevention and inspection team. Many medical teams that have recently returned from the Korean front and Chinese People's Volunteer Army wounded and sick recuperating in various parts of the motherland have requested to return to the front. Volunteer Army wounded and sick recuperating in a sanatorium in Xi'an held a rally to protest against the crime of the American aggressors' germ warfare. At the meeting, they unanimously requested to return to the Korean front to severely strike the American bandits.

The World Peace Council, representing the will of the people of the world, the World Federation of Trade Unions, representing 78 million union members, the International Democratic Women's Federation, representing 135 million women in 62 countries, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, representing 72 million young men and women in 84 countries, and the International Union of Students, representing 5 million students in 71 countries, have all issued solemn statements strongly protesting the American aggressors' germ warfare. The Soviet newspapers "Izvestia," "Komsomolskaya Pravda," "Trud," and "Literaturnaya Gazeta" have all published commentaries denouncing the American aggressors. "Literaturnaya Gazeta" pointed out in an article entitled "Wall Street's Plague Fleas" that American imperialism is the most cruel, vicious, and vile enemy of all freedom-loving people and all mankind. Mankind curses those despicable users of bacteriological weapons. Mankind is the supreme, great, and real force capable of stopping any madman who covets world domination.

People's organizations in Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Albania have all issued declarations denouncing the American murderers. The Central Committee of the Polish Red Cross and the Central Council of the Bulgarian Red Cross have also sent letters to the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Geneva Red Cross Society, requesting that the American aggressors be stopped from this inhuman atrocity that violates international law. Professor Linse, Chairman of the Aid Korea Committee of the National Front National Committee of the German Democratic Republic, called on all peace-loving people in Germany to provide practical assistance to the Korean people. The Bulgarian National Committee for the Defense of Peace receives many telegrams from working people all over the country every day, demanding that the murderers who use bacteriological weapons be severely punished.

The people of Burma, Iran, Austria, France, Italy, Denmark, and the United States have also condemned the cruel acts of the American aggressors. Italian parliamentarian and famous scientist Professor Marchese published an article in "Unità" calling on the entire civilized world to protest against the United States' use of the most shameful bacteriological weapons. U Wang Na, Chairman of the Burma-Soviet Cultural Association, Daw Khin Than, a leader in the women's community, and Ba Mo Tin Aung, a well-known writer, all pointed out that the American aggressors have become enemies of all mankind and that the people of the world must rise up and sanction them. The American "Daily Worker" published an article commenting on the American aggressors' germ warfare, exposing the American aggressors' crimes of using germs to carry out aggressive war. The French newspaper "L'Humanité" published a telegram sent to the United Nations by 150 students in Paris, requesting an end to these inhuman crimes that threaten residents all over the world.

The people of China and the world unanimously oppose the American aggressors' germ warfare, and the American germ warfare criminals will absolutely not escape the just punishment of the people of the world.
