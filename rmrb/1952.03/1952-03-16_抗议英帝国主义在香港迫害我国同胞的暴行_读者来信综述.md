    Protesting the British Imperialist Atrocities of Persecuting Our Compatriots in Hong Kong
    --Summary of Readers' Letters
    Over the past few days, this newspaper has received letters from cadres, soldiers, students, youth, and people from all walks of life across the country, angrily protesting the British imperialists' recent bloody crime of unreasonably arresting and killing our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, and resolutely supporting the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong.
    Comrades Li Qun and two others from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army said in their letter: British imperialism is hostile to the Chinese people, and recently "has developed from illegal arrest and framing to open and bloody slaughter of our patriotic compatriots." Regarding this atrocity, "we must not turn a blind eye. We want to warn the British imperialists that we will never allow imperialism to climb on the heads of our people and act like tyrants again." Zhang Chunsheng and twelve other comrades from the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry wrote: "We have not forgotten the blood debts owed to the Chinese people by British imperialism in history, and we cannot tolerate new atrocities and blood debts today." Comrade Wang Zuoming, a volunteer soldier and honorary veteran, said in his letter: "The Chinese people who have stood up will not allow any imperialist aggression," and British imperialism "must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences of its atrocities."
    The vast majority of readers unanimously expressed in their letters that they are determined to be the strong backing for the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, and will redouble their efforts in their respective positions, using practical actions to counter and crush the shameless aggressive plots of imperialism. Chen Shaoshang, a reader from Inner Mongolia, said: "We are determined to fully support the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong." All the second-year students of the Civil Engineering Department of the Engineering College of Peking University said in their letter: "We resolutely protest the provocative actions of British imperialism. We must carry out the 'Three-Anti' campaign to the end and eliminate bourgeois ideology from the people's education front." Comrade Xu Motao of the Cultural Training Class of a certain artillery unit of the People's Liberation Army wrote in a letter: "Today the Chinese people have stood up. The blood debts owed by imperialism must be repaid! I am determined to work harder in my post and complete the cultural and educational work tasks for 1952." Yu Baichuan, a comrade from the Tunxi Municipal People's Government in southern Anhui, firmly believes that the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong "with the enthusiastic support of the people of the motherland, will surely be victorious."
