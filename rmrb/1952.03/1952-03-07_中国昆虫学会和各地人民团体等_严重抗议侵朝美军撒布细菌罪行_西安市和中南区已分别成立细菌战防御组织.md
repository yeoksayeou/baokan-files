    【Our Newspaper】The China Entomological Society and people's organizations, model workers, scientific workers, medical workers, and returned overseas Chinese in various places have protested against the US military's spreading of bacteria in the invasion of Korea and are determined to counter the atrocities of the American aggressors with practical actions.
    The China Entomological Society issued a statement on March 5 stating: American imperialism has continuously spread various poisonous insects carrying plague, cholera, and other infectious disease bacteria in large quantities on the Korean front and in the rear, attempting to kill Korean peaceful residents and the Chinese and Korean People's forces, and threatening the safety of the Chinese people. American imperialists unscrupulously tear up international law,妄想 [wangxiang - foolishly attempt] to use bacterial warfare to save their disastrous defeat on the Korean front. Chinese entomological workers absolutely cannot tolerate this inhuman and heinous crime of the American aggressors. We are determined to contribute all our strength, mobilize, and prepare for the prevention and control of infectious disease bacteria and poisonous insects. We are also ready to go to the Korean front at any time to participate in the work of exterminating poisonous insects, assisting the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army to complete the glorious tasks assigned by the people of the motherland. The extremely sinful American war dealers are systematically using insects as war tools. In 1950, they dropped potato beetles to damage crops in the German Democratic Republic and other people's democratic countries. Now, they are spreading infectious disease-carrying poisonous insects on a large scale in Korea. We Chinese entomological workers, from this, further realize that American imperialism is not only the mortal enemy of the Chinese people but also the mortal enemy of all mankind and scientific culture. We are confident that we have enough strength to eliminate the poisonous insects spread by the invaders. No brutal weapons can stop the victory of the Chinese and Korean people. The American aggressors will suffer a more shameful and thorough defeat.
    The person in charge of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and model workers Liu Yingyuan, Liu Dezhen, and Li Jinquan from the Shijingshan Power Plant, and Zhu Changjiang, chairman of the Beijing Power Industry Bureau Trade Union, respectively issued statements protesting against the heinous crimes of the American invading army in using bacterial weapons and massacring our captured personnel. The conference of activists among shop employees and workers in Beijing also passed a protest letter. They unanimously expressed their determination to support the Chinese and Korean People's forces in fighting the American aggressors with the victory of the anti-corruption, anti-bribery struggle and various practical actions. The China Vocational Education Society issued a protest statement on February 27, calling on all staff and alumni to implement the anti-corruption struggle and strengthen the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea.
    The Northwest Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression telegraphed the General Association, forwarding to General Kim Il-sung, General Peng Dehuai, all commanders and fighters of the Korean and Chinese People's forces, and Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, on February 28, expressing their determination to respond to the barbaric acts of the American invading army in waging bacterial warfare and killing our captured personnel with practical actions to strengthen the resistance to US aggression and aid Korea. Representatives from the Xi'an Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, the Xi'an Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Xi'an Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Committee of Health Workers, the Xi'an Medical Workers' Union, and the Xi'an Health Workers' Association held a forum on the afternoon of the 2nd to discuss the heinous crimes of the American aggressors in waging bacterial warfare. The representatives unanimously demanded to go to Korea to thoroughly crush the conspiracy of the American aggressors. The Xi'an Bacterial Warfare Special Defense Committee and the preparatory committee for the Epidemic Prevention and Inspection Team were established at the meeting.
    The Central South Branch of the Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Association, representatives from people's organizations and democratic parties in the Central South Region, medical workers, and natural science workers held a forum to protest against the American invading army's waging of bacterial warfare in Korea. The representatives unanimously and enthusiastically supported Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. The Joint Statement of People's Organizations in the Central South Region Protesting the Crimes of the US Military in Waging Bacterial Warfare and Demanding Severe Punishment for American Bacterial Warfare Criminals was passed at the meeting. The Central South Branch of the Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committee of the Chinese Medical Association was officially established on February 29. The association immediately began research, investigation, and propaganda work.
    Zhou Xude, Deputy Director of the Health Department of the Sichuan West People's Administrative Office and Director of the Department of Bacteriology of West China University, issued a statement saying that he cannot tolerate such a cruel crime by the American imperialists. He called on medical, health, and scientific workers and bacteriology and microbiology experts in Chengdu to take active action, conduct bacterial research and defense work, and fight against the American aggressors with practical actions.
    People in Shanghai, Wuxi, and the Southern Jiangsu region have protested against the US military's spreading of bacteria. Lu Yudao, Dean of the College of Science of Fudan University in Shanghai, said: Since World War II, American imperialists have been deliberately preparing for bacterial warfare. The places where the American aggressors conduct bacterial experiments include: the US Detrick Camp Central Laboratory, the University of California, the Indiana Bacterial Factory, the Mississippi Field Test Station, the Utah Field Test Station, and the so-called Medical Office left by Nazi Germany in West Germany, the Tübingen Biochemical Research Institute (researching the accelerated reproduction of dangerous microorganisms), the Hamburg Chemical Research Institute (researching toxic cardiac agents, etc.), and the original Japanese bacterial warfare research institute. In addition, there are seven laboratories in Canada, the British Microbiological Research Institute, etc., which are also centers for bacterial experiments. He said: The heinous crimes committed by American imperialists in Korea have aroused the unanimous anger of the Chinese and Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world. Seven people's organizations in the Southern Jiangsu region said in a statement: We, the people of Southern Jiangsu, are determined to support the Volunteers with practical actions and completely crush the shameless conspiracy of the American imperialists.

They unanimously protested against the crimes of the American aggressors in waging bacterial warfare and hoped that overseas Chinese and people of all ethnic groups in Southeast Asia would take immediate action to condemn and stop this mad and evil behavior of the American aggressors.

    中国昆虫学会和各地人民团体等
    严重抗议侵朝美军撒布细菌罪行
    西安市和中南区已分别成立细菌战防御组织
    【本报讯】中国昆虫学会和各地的人民团体、劳动模范、科学工作者、医务工作者以及归国华侨等，纷纷抗议侵朝美军撒布细菌，并决心以实际行动来回击美国侵略者的暴行。
    中国昆虫学会三月五日发表声明称：美帝国主义连续在朝鲜前线和后方大量撒布带有鼠疫、霍乱及其他传染病菌的多种毒虫，企图杀害朝鲜和平居民和中朝人民部队，并且威胁中国人民的安全。美帝国主义者肆无忌惮地撕毁国际公法，妄想用细菌战争来挽救他们在朝鲜前线的惨败。中国昆虫学工作者绝对不能容忍美国侵略者这种惨无人道的滔天罪行，我们决心贡献出自己一切的力量，动员起来，做好防治传染病菌毒虫的准备工作，并且随时准备到朝鲜前线去参加扑灭毒虫的工作，协助中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军完成祖国人民付给的光荣任务。罪大恶极的美国战争贩子是有计划地利用昆虫作为战争工具的，他们曾经于一九五○年投掷马铃薯甲虫损害德意志民主共和国等人民民主国家的农作物，现在又在朝鲜大规模撒布传染疾病的毒虫。我们中国昆虫学工作者，由此进一步认识到美帝国主义不仅是中国人民的死敌，同时也是全人类和科学文化的死敌。我们确信有足够的力量来消灭侵略者撒布下来的毒虫，任何残暴的武器绝不能阻止中朝人民的胜利，美国侵略者必将遭到更可耻更彻底的失败。
    北京市总工会负责人和石景山发电厂劳动模范刘英源、刘德珍、李金泉，北京电业局工会主席朱长江分别发表谈话，抗议美国侵略军使用细菌武器和屠杀我方被俘人员的滔天罪行。北京市召开的店员工人积极分子大会，也通过了抗议书。他们一致表示要以反贪污、反行贿斗争的胜利和各种实际行动支援中朝人民部队打击美国侵略者。中华职业教育社在二月二十七日发表抗议声明，并号召全社工作人员和社员校友贯彻反贪污斗争、加强抗美援朝工作。

    上海、无锡和苏南区人民对美军撒布细菌，纷纷提出抗议。上海复旦大学理学院院长卢于道说：从第二次世界大战后，美帝国主义者就处心积虑准备进行细菌战争。美国侵略者进行试验细菌的地方有：美国狄特里克营中心试验室、美国加利福尼亚大学、印第安纳州细菌工厂、密士失比州野外试验站、犹他州野外试验站，以及德国纳粹在西德留下的所谓医务处、杜平根生物化学研究所（研究加速危险微生物的繁殖）、汉堡化学研究院（研究毒化心脏剂等），以及日本原有的细菌战研究所。此外还有加拿大七个实验室、英国微生物研究所等也是细菌试验的中心。他说：美帝国主义者在朝鲜所犯的滔天罪行，引起了中朝人民和全世界爱好和平人民的一致愤怒。苏南区七个人民团体在声明中说：我们全苏南人民决以实际行动，支援志愿军，彻底粉碎美帝国主义者的无耻阴谋。
    北京市归国华侨联谊会发动在北京的全体归国华侨签名发表抗议声明。福州、厦门、泉州三市及晋江、仙游、永春、惠安、莆田、同安、福清等县归国华侨联名发表声明。他们一致抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行，并希望国外华侨和东南亚各族人民立即行动起来，声讨和制止美国侵略者这种疯狂的罪恶行为。
