    Self-Criticism of the Manager of the Suzhou Branch of the China Native Produce Company for Resisting Criticism and Suppressing Democracy

    To the Editor: The criticism made by Comrade Yao Ruifang, a worker at the Suzhou Xie Feng Oil Refinery, published in the People's Daily on February 13, regarding the "resistance to criticism and suppression of democracy" by the leadership of our company is completely correct. Our company's leading cadres have long held the erroneous view of only managing business and not concerning themselves with politics, which has led to a very serious phenomenon of disunity among cadres, hindering work and causing huge losses to state assets. However, we still believed that we had "achievements" and were blindly complacent. Therefore, last December, when the Shanghai Liberation Daily, the Southern Jiangsu Daily, and the New Suzhou Daily published criticisms of our corruption, waste, and bureaucratism, we were very dissatisfied and adopted an attitude of resistance. We attempted to overturn the entire criticism by citing "discrepancies in figures." When the higher authorities sent an inspection team and asked us to conduct a self-examination, we still adopted a very un-self-critical attitude. After the vigorous development of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucratism, with the education and help of relevant leaders and comrades, we deeply realized the seriousness of the mistakes we had made. We have made a more profound self-examination. Since the Suzhou Prefectural Committee and Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China dispatched a work team to directly lead us in carrying out the movement, our movement has deepened further and is continuing to develop. In addition to thanking Comrade Yao Ruifang and others, we hope that readers will offer us more valuable opinions.

    Manager of the Suzhou Branch of the China Native Produce Company, Feng Youyong
    Deputy Manager, Wang Shizhong

    中国土产公司苏州支公司经理对抗拒批评压制民主的检讨
    编辑同志：二月十三日人民日报登载的苏州市协丰炼油厂职工姚瑞芳同志对我公司领导方面“抗拒批评压制民主”的批评，是完全正确的。我公司领导干部长期地存在着只管业务不问政治的错误，因而造成了极严重的干部之间不团结的现象，对工作推不动，使国家资财遭受了巨大的损失。可是，我们还认为工作有“成绩”，盲目地自满。因此，去年十二月，当上海解放日报、苏南日报和新苏州报上对我们的贪污、浪费、官僚主义等现象提出批评时，我们很不满意，并且采取了对抗态度。我们藉口“数字有出入”，企图推翻整个批评。当上级派来检查组，要我们检查时，我们还是采取了极不虚心的态度。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动雷厉风行地开展后，在有关领导方面和同志们的教育、帮助下，我们才深深地认识到我们所犯错误的严重性。我们曾经作了较深刻的检查。自中共苏州地委、市委抽人组成工作队直接领导我们开展运动以来，我们的运动已深入一步，并正继续开展。我们除向姚瑞芳等同志致谢之外，希望读者对我们提出更多的宝贵意见。
