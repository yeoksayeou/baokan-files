To the Editor: In order to produce more waterwheels and help farmers irrigate and prevent drought, Lian Linqi, a worker at the Handan Town Public-Operated Cooperative Iron Factory, has successfully manufactured a disc chain machine for making five-wheel waterwheel chains. In the past, the factory's method of manufacturing waterwheel chains was to heat iron rods in a furnace until they were soft and then bend them into chains. Lian Linqi thought this was too slow, so he researched how to make it faster. He thought that the iron rods used to make chains were not too hard, and that there should be a way to bend them at will without using fire. After several experiments, he finally made a disc chain machine in December of last year. Previously, two people could only make five chains a day, but now, using the disc chain machine, they can make ten chains a day, increasing production efficiency by one time. Moreover, because this is cold-formed, it can save eighty pounds of coal every day. The chains made with the disc chain machine are not burned, do not lose their iron skin, and are of better quality, being more durable and strong than before.

    廉林起制造盘链机成功增加了水车生产量
    编辑同志：为了多生产水车，帮助农民浇地防旱，邯郸镇公营工合铁工厂工人廉林起制成了五轮水车链子的盘链机。过去，该厂制造水车链子的方法，是把铁棍放在炉里烧软以后，再弯成链子。廉林起见这样做太慢，所以就研究怎样才能做的快些。他想，做链子的铁棍并不太硬，如果不用火烧，也有办法使铁棍随意弯曲。经过几次试验，他到底在去年十二月做成了一部盘链机。以前两个人一天只能做出五挂链子，现在利用盘链机每天能做十挂，提高生产效率一倍。而且因这是冷制，每天还能省八十斤煤。用盘链机做出的链子，不经火烧，不脱铁皮，质量比以前的坚硬耐用。
