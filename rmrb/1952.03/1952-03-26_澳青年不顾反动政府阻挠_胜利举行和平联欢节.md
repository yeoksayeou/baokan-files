    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Despite the Menzies government's repeated obstructions, the Australian Youth Peace and Friendship Festival was held as scheduled in Sydney from the 15th to the 23rd. Twelve thousand peace lovers from all over Australia attended the festival, and 80 youth representatives from New Zealand and many representatives of Chinese, Greek, and other foreign youths residing in Australia were also invited to participate.
    During the opening ceremony of the festival, 8,000 young people held a grand demonstration parade, holding high national flags of various countries and various banners, expressing their determination to strive for international peace and friendship.
    The conference read out congratulatory messages from young people from Poland, Germany, France, Malaya, Iran, Israel, Venezuela, Cyprus, and many other countries. The congratulatory messages from the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee and the All-China Youth Federation were particularly warmly applauded by the audience. The conference expressed regret that the Chinese youth delegation could not attend due to the Menzies government's refusal to issue entry visas.
    Holmes, Chairman of the Festival Conference Committee, pointed out that the opening ceremony of the festival was a brilliant victory in light of the authorities' efforts to undermine the peace festival. Twelve thousand Australians, representing thousands upon thousands more who wanted to participate but could not, celebrated for peace and friendship. This marks another major step forward on the road to peace.
    The representatives participating in the festival, as well as members of local democratic groups and trade unions, held a mass demonstration on the closing day. Demonstrators held placards and banners with various slogans, calling on the people to strengthen the struggle for peace, and demanding the conclusion of a peace pact, the consolidation of international friendship, the cessation of the arms race, and the cessation of the Korean War. The demonstrators were welcomed by tens of thousands of Sydney citizens. After the demonstration, a mass meeting was held, at which writer Hardy, Nixon, representative of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and representatives of other democratic groups spoke.

    澳青年不顾反动政府阻挠
    胜利举行和平联欢节
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：不顾孟席斯政府的百般阻挠，澳大利亚青年和平与友爱联欢节自十五日至二十三日在悉尼如期举行。出席联欢节的有一万二千名来自全澳各地的和平爱好者，应邀参加的还有新西兰青年代表八十人和侨居澳大利亚的中国、希腊及其他国家青年的代表多人。
    在联欢节大会的开幕典礼中，八千名青年举行了盛大的示威游行，他们高举各国国旗和各种旗帜，表示争取国际和平与友谊的决心。
    大会宣读了波兰、德国、法国、马来亚、伊朗、以色列、委内瑞拉、塞浦路斯及其他许多国家青年们的贺电，苏联青年反法西斯委员会和中华全国民主青年联合会的贺电特别受到全场热烈的欢呼。大会对于中国青年代表团因孟席斯政府拒发入境签证而未能出席一事表示遗憾。
    联欢节大会委员会主席荷姆斯指出：在当局竭力企图破坏和平联欢节情形下，联欢节的开幕典礼是一个辉煌的胜利。一万二千名澳大利亚人，代表成千成万的更多的愿意参加而未能参加的人，为和平与友谊而欢庆。这标志着在走向和平的道路上向前迈进的另一大步。
    参加联欢节的代表们以及当地民主团体和工会的会员们，在闭幕日举行了群众示威。示威者举着标语牌和横幅，上面写着各种标语，号召人民加强和平斗争，并要求缔结和平公约、巩固国际友谊、停止扩张军备运动、停止朝鲜战争。示威者受到悉尼好几万市民的欢迎。示威结束后并举行群众大会，作家哈第、世界民主青年联盟代表尼克逊和其他民主团体的代表在会上讲了话。
