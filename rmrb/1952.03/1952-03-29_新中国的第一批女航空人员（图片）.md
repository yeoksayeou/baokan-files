The First Group of Female Aviators in New China
Miao Di, Zhao Zhifang (painting)
(Based on Zhang Wen's report, "The First Group of Female Aviators in New China")

	Seven: Ground crew members working at the airfield, in order to learn various aircraft maintenance tasks, fearlessly endure the sun's scorching heat and the bitter cold's invasion, persisting in their work to ensure the safe flight of the aircraft. Initially, they found it difficult to climb onto or jump down from the aircraft, but these difficulties were overcome by their strong will. Sometimes, in order to master the techniques, their hands would become frozen in the cold weather, and their clothes would be soaked in the heavy rain, but they paid no attention, remaining focused on their work.

	Eight: Once, a female mechanic, while learning to repair an aircraft, slipped and fell from the aircraft, injuring her back. But when she thought of the tenacious will of the Soviet "Real Man," Maresyev, her confidence was strengthened, and she endured the pain, got up, and continued to work.

	Nine: The physical condition of female comrades, for the flying life and field maintenance work that requires a certain amount of physical exertion, poses some difficulties before they have undergone training. For example, one comrade, whose physical condition originally qualified, unexpectedly vomited during her first "sensory flight."

    七、在空矿的机场上工作的地勤人员，为了学会各种机务工作，毫不畏惧烈日的曝晒和严寒的侵袭，坚持工作，以保证飞机的安全飞行。最初她们爬上飞机或从飞机上跳下来都感觉困难，但是这些困难都被她们坚强的意志战胜了。有时为了学好技术，她们在寒冷的天气里把手冻僵了，在大雨中衣服被淋湿了，也不理睬，仍然集中精力地工作着。
    八、有一次，一个女机械员在学习检修飞机的时候，从飞机上滑了下来，把腰摔坏了。但是当她想到苏联“真正的人”马列席耶夫的顽强意志时，她的信心又坚定了，她忍痛爬了起来继续工作。
    九、女同志的体质，对于需要消耗一定体力的飞行生活和外场机务工作，在没有经过锻炼以前，是有些困难的。例如有一个同志身体本来合格，在第一次“感觉飞行”的时候，想不到地呕吐了。
