    Seeing the Emergence of Collective Farms in Our Country, We Love Our Great Motherland Even More
    ——Summary of Readers' Letters

    Recently, many readers have written to this newspaper, describing their excitement and confidence in the socialist future of our great motherland after reading the article "The Growth of a Collective Farm" published in this newspaper.

    Reader Yan Hua from the Ministry of Public Security of the Central Government wrote in his letter that "The Growth of a Collective Farm" "fully proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's call for peasants to 'get organized'." Xiao Shuzhen, a reader from Jingxing Normal School in Hebei, wrote that he couldn't help but laugh when he saw the peasants of the motherland living happily. He wrote on the side of the newspaper containing "The Growth of a Collective Farm": "Motherland, how great and lovely! I am proud to be your child! To defend you, I will resolutely strike down the invaders! When the motherland needs me, I will put on my military uniform and set off immediately!" In his letter, he hopes that writers and journalists will write more works that reflect the new things in the growing motherland. Readers Xiu Rong, Shi Qi, and Yu Liang from Jianchang Hutong No. 14 in Beijing wrote: After reading "The Growth of a Collective Farm," we are even more determined to serve the peasants. They suggested that local governments organize peasants to visit the farms and hoped that the cultural circles would introduce the situation of the farms to the peasants, so that every peasant would be educated in "collectivization." Nie Fuyuan and other twelve students from the Department of Plant Pathology of Beijing Agricultural University wrote that after reading "The Agricultural Production Cooperative of Chuandi Village" and "The Growth of a Collective Farm" in this newspaper, they intimately felt that "the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow"; this matter encouraged everyone's determination to study hard, and everyone is prepared to serve the upcoming large-scale agricultural construction of the motherland. Chen Huiru, from the "Five-Anti" Working Group of the National Committee of the Chinese Store Employees' Union, wrote: In this article, I saw the unlimited future of the Chinese working people. This matter further enhanced my confidence in winning the struggle against theft. Wang Siji, a reader from Jinyu Hutong in Beijing, wrote that I never thought that New China would develop so quickly, and the collective farms seen in Soviet films have also appeared in China. I am determined to strengthen ideological reform and work hard to strive for the early arrival of a socialist society. Chen Shaoshang from the People's Court of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in Zhangjiakou wrote: After reading "The Growth of a Collective Farm," I felt very happy and my mind was suddenly opened; the past idea that "it is impossible for farmers who are used to being scattered to collectivize" has been completely resolved, and I truly realized that the future of our great motherland is infinitely bright and splendid.
