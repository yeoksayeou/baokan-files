    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th—Following the bloody atrocities of deliberately and systematically slaughtering Chinese people on the 1st, the British government in Hong Kong is now preparing a major conspiracy to further persecute patriotic compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon. According to their original plan, the British government in Hong Kong first used police patrol cars to provoke the masses welcoming the慰问团 (comfort mission), and then armed attacked the orderly departing masses from the station, thus creating a bloody massacre. With the blood on their hands still wet, the British government in Hong Kong then issued a statement through their press office, falsely claiming that if the Federation of Trade Unions could have notified the relevant groups of the changed date of the comfort mission's arrival in Hong Kong, "the whole unfortunate incident might not have happened." The British government in Hong Kong also used the reactionary Chinese and English newspapers under their control, such as the "De Chen Xi Bao," to clamor loudly, creating "public opinion" for intensified persecution of our people's organizations, attempting to attribute the massacre to the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, which has more than 100,000 members, thereby persecuting the mass leaders beloved by the broad masses of workers and compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong. This new conspiracy of the British government in Hong Kong has been encouraged by London. British Colonial Secretary Lyttelton's "statement" in the House of Commons on the 3rd also did not hesitate to distort the facts and wantonly slander. However, when explaining the cause of the "riots," Lyttelton revealed that it was due to the influence of the rumor that "the comfort mission had indeed been stopped at the border," and it was the press office of the British government in Hong Kong that spread this "rumor." On the morning of the day the tragedy occurred, the Hong Kong British government press office publicly stated that they had received "reliable information" that "the comfort mission had arrived in Shenzhen last night and planned to enter British territory at 10:30 this morning," and provocatively stated that "they would be rejected." The people of Hong Kong and Kowloon from all walks of life, who were eagerly awaiting the comfort mission, were precisely influenced by this rumor and fell into the trap of the British executioners. British imperialism is now trying its best to exploit this bloody incident. The Hong Kong reactionary newspaper "South China Morning Post" has published an editorial saying: "Anyone who is unwilling to comply with the necessary interests of this port will be driven out of the territory." This clearly exposes that the British ruling authorities in Hong Kong, under the direction of US imperialism, are attempting to use this to carry out the conspiracy they planned a month ago to arrest patriotic compatriots from all walks of life on a large scale. After the massacre, more than one hundred Chinese people detained by the British police are still imprisoned in British police stations. The full list and recent situation of those arrested have not been announced, and their families are forbidden from visiting them. It is reliably learned that the arrested compatriots have generally suffered fascist torture and beatings by the British police in prison, and several patriotic compatriots have become disabled as a result. The despicable and shameless British government in Hong Kong is preparing to secretly deport them to the Taiwan bandit gang, the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. The Chinese people will never tolerate such inhuman and bloody atrocities by British imperialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th—The British government in Hong Kong has actually sentenced our compatriots who were illegally arrested on the 1st. In the bloody massacre created by the British government in Hong Kong on the 1st, a large number of our patriotic compatriots were arrested. On the 3rd, the British government in Hong Kong conducted an illegal trial of 24 of our arrested compatriots, and on the 4th, they forcibly imposed the "crime" of "improper behavior and inciting the disruption of peace" on seven of them and sentenced them. Among them, Lin Huizhong, Qian Jvjun, Zhou Dingjin, Dong Xiuye, Wen Guanghui, and Tan Quanyong were sentenced to three months of "hard labor prison," and Li Quan was sentenced to two months of "hard labor prison." The remaining arrested compatriots are being illegally tried. Of the three elementary school students, besides one twelve-year-old who was "released on bail pending trial," the other two are still being detained in British police stations.

    卑鄙无耻的香港英国统治当局
    阴谋进一步迫害我港九爱国同胞
    我国人民决不能容忍英帝国主义血腥暴行
    【新华社广州七日电】香港英国政府继一日演出有计划、有布置地屠杀中国人民的血腥暴行之后，现更准备布置进一步迫害我港九各界爱国同胞的大阴谋。香港英国政府按照原定计划在一日上午先用警察巡逻车向欢迎慰问团的群众挑衅，继而武装袭击有秩序地离开车站的群众，因而制成血腥屠杀事件。双手血渍未干的香港英国政府，事后竟通过他们的新闻处发出公布，诬称：倘工会联合会能及时把慰问团改期来港的消息通知各有关团体，“则整个不幸事件或许不会发生”。香港英国政府并利用他们所控制的“德臣西报”等反动中英文报纸大声叫嚣，造成加紧迫害我人民团体的“舆论”，企图把屠杀事件的发生归咎于拥有十万以上会员的港九工会联合会，借此迫害为香港广大工人群众及各界同胞所爱戴的群众领袖。香港英国政府这一新的阴谋，受到了伦敦方面的鼓励。英殖民部部长李特尔顿三日在议院所发表的“声明”，同样不惜歪曲事实，肆意诬蔑。可是，李特尔顿在说明“骚动事件”的原因时，却泄露出是由于“慰问团确已被阻于边境”的谣言影响，而散播这个“谣言”的正是香港英国政府的新闻处。惨案发生的当天上午，香港英国政府新闻处曾公开声明说他们业已接获“确实消息”，“该慰问团业于昨晚到达深圳，拟于今晨十时三十分进入英境”，并挑拨性地表示“彼等将被拒绝”。热诚盼望着慰问团的香港、九龙各界人民，正是受了这个谣言的影响，而陷入英方刽子手们的圈套里。英帝国主义现正竭力利用这一次血腥事件。香港反动报纸“南华早报”已发表社论说：“任何人如不愿遵从本港的必要利益者，则必被驱离境。”这就明显地暴露了在美帝国主义指使下的香港英国统治当局正企图借此遂行他们在一个月以前策划的大规模逮捕我各界爱国同胞的阴谋。屠杀事件发生后，被英警拘留的一百多个中国人民，现仍被囚禁在英方警署中，被捕者的全部名单和近况没有公布，并禁绝他们的家属探访。据确悉，被捕同胞在监狱中曾普遍遭受英警法西斯式的毒刑拷打，有数位爱国同胞已因此变成残废。卑鄙无耻的香港英国政府正在准备把他们秘密逮解给中国人民的死敌台湾匪帮。中国人民对英帝国主义这种灭绝人性的血腥暴行，决不能容忍。
    【新华社广州七日电】香港英国政府竟将在一日非法捕去的我国同胞判处刑罚。在一日香港英国政府制造的血腥屠杀事件中，我爱国同胞大批被捕。三日，香港英国政府对我被捕同胞二十四人进行了非法审讯，四日竟对其中的七人，强加以“行为不端，挑动破坏和平”的“罪名”，并判处刑罚。其中林辉忠、钱聚钧、周定进、董修业、文广辉、谭权勇等六人被判入“苦工监”三个月，李全被判入
    “苦工监”两个月。其余被捕同胞被继续非法审讯中。其中三个小学生，除了十二岁的一个“缴保出外候审”外，其他两人仍然被拘禁在英国警署中。
