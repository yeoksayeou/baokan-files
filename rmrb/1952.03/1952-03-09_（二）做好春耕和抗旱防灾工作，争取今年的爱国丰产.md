    (II) Do a Good Job in Spring Plowing and Drought Resistance to Strive for a Patriotic Bumper Harvest This Year
    I. Increase Output per Unit Area and Produce More Grain to Support the Volunteers
    Last year, we achieved great victories on the agricultural production front. The total grain output of the country reached 92.8 percent of the highest pre-war annual output; cotton production was one-third higher than the highest pre-war year. This greatly strengthened the fight against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, improved the lives of the broad masses of people, and promoted the improvement of the country's financial and economic situation.
    On February 15 this year, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government adopted and promulgated the "Decision on Agricultural Production in 1952," requiring the country to increase grain production by 8 percent and cotton production by 20 percent on the basis of last year; and put forward the basic policy of agricultural production this year, which is to concentrate efforts to increase output per unit area. This requirement is achievable for every farmer. Because the level of agricultural production in our country is generally still very low, even in places that have reached and exceeded the highest pre-war level, it can still be greatly improved. Last year, Qu Yaoli's cotton in Shanxi reached a maximum of 920 jin per mu; Zhang Xishun's millet in Hebei reached a maximum of 1,300 jin per mu; Chen Yongkang's rice in southern Jiangsu reached a maximum of 1,433 jin per mu. The highest yields in the Soviet Union are even higher than this: 1,889 jin of cotton per mu; 2,680 jin of millet; and 1,975 jin of rice. Therefore, some people think that their fields have already "reached the top of production" and that "there is no way to increase production anymore." This is a conservative idea, and this idea should be changed. Although we cannot immediately increase to the highest yields of Qu Yaoli, Zhang Xishun, etc., it is entirely possible to increase production by ten jin or dozens of jin per mu per year. There are approximately 1.4 billion mu of cultivated land in the country. If each mu yields only 20 jin more grain, it adds up to 28 billion jin. What a great contribution this would be to the fight against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea and the country's economic construction!
    II. Overcome the Idea of "Relying on Heaven for Food" and Prevent Drought and Disasters Early
    The most important thing in patriotic bumper harvest is to prevent various disasters. Last year, the country built and repaired farmland water conservancy projects on 9.02 million mu of land, and reorganized and improved farmland water conservancy projects on more than 71.5 million mu of land, with an estimated increase in grain production of at least 5 billion jin. However, our work is not yet sufficient. Last year, 35 million mu of farmland suffered from drought, resulting in 8 billion jin less food being produced. This year, everyone should remember this lesson and not watch the drought snatch away our grain. Last winter, many places had little rain and snow, which may increase the difficulty of spring plowing this year. Some places are now showing signs of spring drought, so the most urgent task at present is to prevent drought and prepare for drought resistance as soon as possible. On February 8 this year, the Government Administration Council issued the "Decision on Vigorously Launching a Mass Drought Prevention and Drought Resistance Movement." Everyone should be well organized and do it seriously according to the instructions of the decision. In the past, many people could not see the power of people and felt that a bumper harvest must rely on "heaven's will" and that "natural disasters" could not be overcome. The facts of the past few years have proved that this idea is completely wrong. As long as everyone is determined and well organized, they can overcome all disasters and strive for a bumper harvest.
    Recently, farmers in many places have been working hard to carry out drought prevention activities. Farmers in Yueshe County, Shanxi Province, have already accumulated ice and snow on more than 10,000 mu of cultivated land, which, when melted, is equivalent to a rainfall. In Dingyuan County, northern Anhui, nearly 100,000 farmers are building small-scale water conservancy projects. They have already built more than 2,500 ponds and 10 dams, and opened 25 canals, directly benefiting more than 149,000 mu of farmland. However, some people in some places are still holding on to the idea of ​​taking chances and staring at the sky, hoping for rain. This will be detrimental. We should take action quickly, be prepared for any eventuality, and sow seeds on time.
    At the same time, do not relax the work of preventing disasters such as water, flooding, insects, and diseases. For example, the spring repair project of dikes should be completed in time; there must be careful design and construction when opening rivers and releasing water to avoid affecting the safety of dikes; last year, many places were not cold in winter, and insect pests may occur this year, so preparations should be made early.
    III. Prepare More Fertilizer and Learn from Bumper Harvest Experiences
    To increase output per unit area, preparing fertilizer is a very important thing. "People need to eat, and fields need fertilizer. Fat pigs produce more meat, and fertile fields produce more grain." Everyone understands this principle. All localities have various methods of accumulating fertilizer, and they should learn from each other and compete in accumulating fertilizer. Those who can buy bean cake and fertilizer powder should buy as much as possible; those who can raise pigs, accumulate ash and soil, dig grass turf, and collect fallen leaves to make fertilizer should make fertilizer; old people and children should go to collect scattered manure if they have the time.
    Another important task to increase production is to improve farming techniques. Last year, there were many bumper harvest models. The land they cultivated was the same as everyone else's, and the fertilization was similar, but they did better than others in terms of seed selection, cultivation methods, planting methods, and mastering the season and amount of fertilization and watering, so they produced more grain. Everyone should learn from these people's experiences.
    IV. Organize Mutual Aid and Cooperation and Formulate Patriotic Increase Production and Thrift Plans
    When doing these tasks, everyone should pay attention to organizing mutual aid and formulating patriotic increase production and thrift plans. This year, the Central People's Government called on farmers across the country to universally organize mutual aid. Those who already have seasonal mutual aid organizations should further organize long-term mutual aid groups combining agricultural and sideline production on a voluntary basis; where conditions permit, agricultural production cooperatives can also be organized. According to past experience in various places, the harvests of general mutual aid groups are better than individual farming; agricultural production cooperatives are better than mutual aid groups. Everyone should pay attention to this issue.
    Formulating patriotic increase production and thrift plans can give us clear goals to strive for, rationally allocate labor and animal power, and prepare food, seeds, farm tools, and fertilizers in advance to avoid temporary confusion and failure to do a good job. At present, farmers in many places have reorganized mutual aid organizations, reviewed and revised patriotic covenants, and formulated specific patriotic increase production and thrift plans in villages, groups, and households, which are all very good. Everyone should learn from them in order to harvest more grain, so that we will have more strength to strike at the American aggressors and carry out construction more quickly.

### （二）做好春耕和抗旱防灾工作，争取今年的爱国丰产

专栏：宣传员的讲话

    （二）做好春耕和抗旱防灾工作，争取今年的爱国丰产
    一、提高单位面积产量，多打粮食支援志愿军
    去年，我们在农业生产战线上取得了很大的胜利。全国的粮食总产量，达到了战前最高年产量的百分之九十二点八；棉花产量比战前最高的年份还多了三分之一。这就大大增强了抗美援朝的力量，改善了广大人民的生活，并促进了国家财政经济状况的好转。
    今年二月十五日，中央人民政府政务院通过并发布了“关于一九五二年农业生产的决定”，要求全国在去年的基础上增产粮食百分之八，增产棉花百分之二十；并提出今年农业生产的基本方针，是集中力量提高单位面积产量。这个要求，是每一个农民都可以做到的。因为我国的农业生产水平一般还很低，就是达到和超过了战前最高水平的地方，也还能够大大提高。去年，山西曲耀离的棉花，最高的一亩收到九百二十斤；河北张希顺的谷子，最高的一亩收到一千三百斤；苏南陈永康的水稻，最高的一亩收到一千四百三十三斤。苏联的最高产量，比这还要高得多：一亩棉花收到一千八百八十九斤；谷子二千六百八十斤；水稻一千九百七十五斤。因此，有些人以为自己的田地已经“生产到顶了”，“没有办法再增产了”，这是一种保守的思想，应该改变这种思想。我们虽然不能够一下子就提高到曲耀离、张希顺等的最高产量那么高，但在每亩地上每年增产十斤、几十斤粮食是完全可能的。全国大约有耕地十四亿亩，每亩地只要多收二十斤粮食，加起来就有二百八十亿斤。这对于抗美援朝和国家经济建设，是多大的贡献啊！
    二、克服“靠天吃饭”思想，及早防旱防灾
    爱国丰产中的头一件大事，是要防备各种灾害。去年，全国新建和修复了九百零二万亩地的农田水利工程，整理和改善了七千一百五十余万亩地的农田水利工程，估计增产的粮食至少有五十亿斤。但我们的工作还作得不够。去年受旱成灾的田地还有三千五百万亩，少打了食粮八十亿斤。今年大家应该记住这教训，不要眼看着旱灾抢去了我们的粮食。去年冬天许多地方雨雪少，可能给今年的春耕增加困难，有些地方现在就有了春旱的征象，所以目前最紧要的事，就是及早防旱和准备抗旱。今年二月八日，政务院曾经发布“关于大力开展群众性的防旱、抗旱运动的决定”，大家应该好好地组织起来，照着决定所指示的认真去做。过去有许多人看不到人的力量，觉得丰收必须靠“天顺”，“天灾”没有办法克服；几年以来的事实已经证明这种思想完全不对。只要大家有决心，组织得好，便能战胜一切灾害，争取丰收。
    最近，许多地方的农民兄弟已经紧张地开展防旱运动了。山西榆社县农民已经在一万多亩耕地上积了冰雪，融化后抵得一场雨。皖北定远一县就有近十万农民兴修小型水利，他们已经修好了水塘二千五百多口和水坝十座，开了二十五道渠，直接受益的农田有十四万九千多亩。但是，有的地方还有人抱着侥幸心理，瞪着眼睛盼下雨，这样下去会吃亏的。应该赶快行动起来，做到有备无患，按时播种。
    同时，对于防止水、涝、虫、病等灾害的工作也不要放松。比如，堤防的春修工程要及时完成；开河放水时一定要有周密的设计和施工，以免影响堤防的安全；去年很多地方冬天不冷，今年可能发生虫害，也应该早做准备。
    三、多多准备肥料，学习丰产经验
    要提高单位面积产量，准备肥料是一桩很重要的事。“人要吃饭，田要吃肥。猪肥多肉，田肥多谷。”这个道理是大家都懂得的。各地方都有各种积肥的办法，应该互相学习，竞赛积肥。能够买豆饼、肥田粉的应尽量买；能够养猪、积灰土、刨草皮、拾树叶来造肥的就造肥；老人小孩有功夫的就去拾散粪。
    提高产量的另一个重要工作，是要改进耕作技术。去年，有许多丰产模范，种的地和大家一样，施肥也差不多，可是他们在选种、耕耘方法、栽植方法、掌握施肥浇水的季节和份量等各方面比别人做得好，就多打了粮食。大家应该好好向这些人学习经验。
    四、组织互助合作，订出爱国增产节约计划
    大家在做这些工作的时候，应该注意组织互助和订立爱国增产节约计划。今年，中央人民政府号召全国各地农民普遍组织互助。过去已有季节性互助组织的，应进一步在自愿条件下组织农副业生产结合的长期互助组；条件具备的，还可以组织农业生产合作社。根据各地过去的经验，一般互助组的收成都比单干好；农业生产合作社又比互助组好。大家应该重视这个问题。
    订爱国增产节约计划，能使我们有明确的奋斗目标，把劳力、畜力作合理的支配，准备好吃粮、种子、农具、肥料，免得临时忙乱，做不好。目前，许多地方的农民已经整理了互助组织，检查修订了爱国公约，并且在村、组、户中订出了具体的爱国增产节约计划，这都是很好的。大家应该向他们学习，以便多收粮食，使我们更有力量打击美国侵略者，更快地进行建设。
