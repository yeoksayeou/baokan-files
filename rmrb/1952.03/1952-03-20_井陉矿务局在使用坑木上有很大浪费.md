    Serious Waste in the Use of Pit Props at the Jingxing Mining Bureau

    Editor: The state-owned Jingxing Mining Bureau incurred significant waste last year due to incorrect specifications of timber used. It is estimated that approximately 70% of the pit props purchased by the mine throughout the year were non-standard. Some were too long and, although they could be cut to size, they were not entirely suitable for the actual needs of mining and tunneling, resulting in considerable waste from using large materials for small purposes. The trimmed excess alone amounted to 900 cubic meters throughout the year, valued at 650 million yuan. Approximately 4,000+ cubic meters of timber were a few inches too thick or too thin than the original specifications, rendering them unusable without cutting. These timbers have been left in the open for a long time, exposed to wind and rain, tying up capital of more than 2.3 billion yuan. The labor and transportation costs incurred in cutting the wood are also a significant loss. This serious waste is almost equivalent to the entire working capital of a small mine for the whole year. I suggest that the Jingxing Mining Bureau and the relevant supply agencies should pay close attention to solving this problem.

    Editor's Note: The relevant authorities should immediately investigate and promptly rectify the phenomenon of timber waste at the Jingxing Mining Bureau.

    井陉矿务局在使用坑木上有很大浪费
    编辑同志：国营井陉矿务局在去年一年内，因所用木材规格不对，造成了很大浪费。据估计，该矿全年内购入不合规格的坑木约占百分之七十。有的尺寸过长，虽可裁截使用，但不能完全适合采掘工程上的实际需要，大材小用的损失又很大。全年只是截掉的长余部分就有九百立方公尺，价值六亿五千万元。坑木比原定规格粗或细几寸，无法裁截使用的约有四千多立方公尺。这些木材长期在露天放置，饱受风雨侵蚀，积压了资金二十三亿多元。截木耗用的人工和运费的损失也是很大的。这种严重的浪费差不多等于一个小矿全年的全部流动资金。我建议井陉矿务局和有关供应机关应切实注意解决这个问题。

    编者按：井陉矿务局浪费木材现象应由有关机关即予检查并及时纠正。
