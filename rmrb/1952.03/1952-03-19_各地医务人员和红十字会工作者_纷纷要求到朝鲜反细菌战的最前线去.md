Medical personnel and Red Cross workers from all over the country are demanding to go to the front lines of the anti-bacterial warfare in Korea

The crime of the American aggressors in spreading bacteria-laden insects and conducting bacterial warfare in the Korean front lines, rear areas, and within the borders of Northeast China has aroused boundless anger among medical workers and Red Cross workers throughout the country. They resolutely support the statement of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government and respond to the call of Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, and are demanding to go to the Korean front lines to extinguish the poisonous flames of the American aggressors' bacterial warfare!

More than a thousand health workers in Dalian gathered on the 11th and resolved to actively participate in the fight against bacterial warfare.

Medical and health workers in Tianjin are demanding to go to the forefront of the fight against bacterial warfare. As of the 12th, more than 1,140 people have signed up with the Tianjin Medical Workers' Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea to go to the Korean front lines and the Northeast to participate in epidemic prevention work. These include bacteriologists, doctors, nurses, epidemic prevention personnel, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, and other medical workers. They have also submitted letters of request and letters of determination to the committee, expressing extreme resentment for the towering crimes of American imperialism. All members of the Tianjin Fourth Volunteer Medical Team, who are serving the wounded and sick of the Volunteer Army at the front, requested the Tianjin Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea to allow them to participate in the first batch of epidemic prevention teams in the Northeast or Korea. The original members of the Tianjin First Volunteer Medical Team and Shi Xi'en, the captain of the Third Volunteer Medical Team, also requested the committee to return to the front line and join the fight against bacterial warfare, giving a strong rebuff to the American aggressors' mad provocation. All employees of the Municipal Third Hospital, in addition to signing up to participate in the first batch of epidemic prevention teams, also organized to study bacteriology, epidemiology, and battlefield first aid, and formed a propaganda team to conduct anti-bacterial warfare propaganda in factories, schools, and streets.

Twenty professors and students from the infectious disease entomology training class of Guiyang Medical College wrote to Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, on March 5, saying: "We resolutely dedicate everything we have to defend peace and defend our motherland, and use our technology to extinguish the poisonous flames of the American bandits' bacterial warfare!" They also stated: "We have made mental preparations, and after receiving instructions from higher authorities, we will prepare epidemic prevention equipment and set off quickly." On the 13th of this month, the college formed the Guiyang Medical College Bacterial Warfare Epidemic Prevention Team and sent a telegram to the Red Cross Society of China, requesting: "Immediately rush to the front to serve."

All the students of the medical training class of the Changzhou Red Cross Branch wrote to President Li Dequan twice, saying: "Our anger can no longer be suppressed by the shameless and barbaric actions of the American aggressors!" They requested to be immediately incorporated into the epidemic prevention team and sent to the front. On the 10th, they telegraphed: "We are ready and waiting for orders."

Medical workers from the Fuzhou Red Cross Branch, the Fuzhou Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, and the Fuzhou Health Workers Association are demanding to join the epidemic prevention team to work in Korea. Twenty-four medical workers from the Wuhu Red Cross Branch Hospital are vying to sign up, striving to go to the front line of the anti-bacterial warfare immediately. Fifty-year-old Director Fang Songsheng said when signing up, "I am not old yet, I want to bring my skills to the front to fight for the health of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people!" Twenty-five midwives, including Zhang Zhengqin from the Nanjing Red Cross Branch, also signed up, demanding to go to the front line of the anti-bacterial warfare.

Medical workers in various parts of Shaanxi Province have organized themselves and firmly demanded to go to Korea to participate in the epidemic prevention medical team. According to incomplete statistics from Xi'an, Baoji, Xianyang, Xingping, Chunhua, Weinan, Chengcheng, Nanzheng and other places alone, there are already 1,948 people. The Xi'an Health Workers' Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea has formed a "Special Committee for Bacterial Warfare Defense" and is actively working. More than 80% of health workers have voluntarily signed up to participate in the epidemic prevention inspection team to Korea. The Chengcheng Health Workers Association Branch issued a statement saying: "Blood debts must be paid in blood. The enemy's use of bacterial warfare has strengthened our determination to resist America and aid Korea." There are now seventeen medical personnel in Chengcheng County who have volunteered to go to Korea. Among them is an old doctor, Yuan Hanshen, who is already fifty-eight years old and is also vying to sign up.

Others, such as Gao Wenmin of the Guanxian Red Cross Branch Hospital in Sichuan, Meng Jiabao, a worker at the Tianjin Red Cross Branch, Li Jun of the Chaiqiao Hospital in Zhenhai County, Zhejiang, and Fan Jizhou of Chongqing, Sichuan, have all expressed their boundless anger at the American aggressors' use of bacterial weapons and demanded to go to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare to fight to eliminate bacteria. Zhu Guangyu from the cadre school of the China Construction Corporation in Beijing and Han Lin from the Youth Publishing House, who are deaf-mute workers, went to the Red Cross Society of China on March 10 and requested to participate in the epidemic prevention team. They wrote on a piece of paper: "Although we cannot hear and are not experts, we have eyes, hands, and physical strength, and can be responsible for transporting epidemic prevention drugs and rescue work."
