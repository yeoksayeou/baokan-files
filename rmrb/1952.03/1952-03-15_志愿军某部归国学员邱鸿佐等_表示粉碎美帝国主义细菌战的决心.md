    Volunteer Army Unit Returnees Qiu Hongzuo and others express their determination to crush the US imperialist germ warfare

    Editor: We are volunteer army trainees who have recently returned to the country. The towering crime of the American invading army spreading germs has aroused our incomparable anger! We absolutely cannot tolerate the US imperialists' crimes of destroying international law and exterminating humanity!

    In the past, we drove the American invaders across the Yalu River and defeated the enemies who dared to invade us. Now we can also defeat the enemy's germ warfare. We know that the Japanese fascists once used bacteriological weapons to kill the Chinese people, but the final victory belonged to us, and the losers were the Japanese fascist bandits. Today, US imperialism has inherited the mantle of the German and Japanese fascists and is brutally using bacteriological weapons. This will not only fail to save it from defeat in Korea, but will accelerate its demise. We have the confidence and the strength to crush this aggressive conspiracy of US imperialism!

    志愿军某部归国学员邱鸿佐等
    表示粉碎美帝国主义细菌战的决心
    编辑同志：我们是归国不久的志愿军学员。美国侵略军撒布细菌的滔天罪行，激起了我们无比的愤怒！我们对美帝国主义这种破坏国际公法、灭绝人性的罪行决不能容忍！
    过去，我们从鸭绿江把美国侵略者赶过三八线，把敢于冒险侵犯我们的敌人打败了。现在我们同样能够战胜敌人的细菌战。我们知道，日本法西斯曾以细菌武器杀害中国人民，但是，最后的胜利属于我们，而失败者是日本法西斯匪徒们。今天美帝国主义又继承了德、日法西斯的衣钵，残暴地使用细菌武器。这不但不能挽救它在朝鲜的失败，相反地必将加速它的灭亡。我们有信心，有力量，一定能粉碎美帝国主义这种侵略阴谋！
