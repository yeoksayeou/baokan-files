Increase Yield Per Unit Area, Strike at the American Bandits
National Agricultural Labor Model Han En

　　I am already over forty years old. I have never felt so hopeful and happy as I do now. From childhood, I worked hard for the landlords, enduring wind and rain 360 days a year, without even getting a full meal. The twenty-one households in our Bao'an Village were the same as me. So people called our village the "Poor Stick Village." Since the Communist Party came, we were given houses and land, and organized mutual aid production teams, and our lives have been getting better day by day. Now all the villagers have reached the living standards of middle peasants. But we are not satisfied, we want to follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to a more beautiful socialist society. When I think of the future, I feel a burning energy in my body, and I am especially happy when I work. Gao Fengming in our village often smiles at me, touching his gray hair, and says, "Don't think I'm almost sixty years old, I still want to run towards socialism with you!" This year, we have taken the mutual aid team a step further, developing it into an agricultural production cooperative, which brings us closer to a beautiful future!

　　Can we allow the American beasts to trample on our good life? No, absolutely not!

　　Hearing the news that the American beasts are spreading bacterial insects in our Northeast, we are extremely angry, and we must never let them act so atrociously. The American aggressors have been defeated by our Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and now they want to use bacteria to save their defeat. This is purely a dream. We must make them fail completely in the end, just like the Japanese devils. Farmer brothers and sisters across the country, we must step up production, practice strict economy, and vigorously support the Volunteer Army, and severely strike at the American beasts. Our agricultural production cooperative guarantees to everyone: increase grain yield by five *sheng* per *mu*. We are now busy preparing for spring plowing. We have prepared more than 1,350 carts of manure, planning to apply 35 carts of manure per *qing*. We have selected 1,350 *jin* of excellent soybean seeds and 1,000 *jin* of rice seeds, and have generally done germination tests. I hope that farmer brothers and sisters will take active action and use practical actions to increase yield per unit area to increase the strength to strike at American imperialism.

    提高单位面积产量，打击美国强盗
    全国农业劳动模范　韩恩
    我已是四十多岁的人了。我从来也没有像现在过得这样有“奔头”（希望），这样幸福。从小我就给地主家干重活，三百六十天风里来，雨里去，连一碗饱饭都混不上。我们保安屯的二十一户老乡，也和我一样。所以人们都把我们这个屯叫“穷棒子屯”。自从共产党来了以后，我们分得了房子和土地，组织了生产互助组，生活一天比一天好了。现在全屯人都达到了中农的生活水平。但我们并不满足，我们还要跟着共产党和毛主席走向更美好的社会主义社会。一想到将来，我身上就发出一股火辣辣的劲头，干起活来也特别高兴。我们村的郜凤鸣常摸着自己的花白头发向我笑着说：“别看我今年是快六十岁的人了，还要跟你们一块奔向社会主义呢！”今年我们又把互助组提高了一步，发展成农业生产合作社，使我们向美好的未来又走近了一步！
    我们这样好的光景能让美国野兽们蹂躏吗？不能，绝对不能！
    听到美国野兽在咱们东北撒布细菌毒虫的消息，我们气愤极了，我们是绝不能让它这样行凶的。美国侵略军被咱们的志愿军和朝鲜人民军打败了，现在想用细菌来挽救他们的败局。这纯粹是梦想。我们一定要叫它和日本鬼子一样，最后彻底失败。全国农民兄弟们，咱们要加紧生产，厉行节约，大力支援志愿军，狠狠打击美国野兽。我们的农业生产合作社向大家提出保证：每亩地多打五升粮。现在我们正忙着准备春耕。我们已经准备了一千三百五十多车粪，计划每垧地上粪三十五车。我们已经选出优良的大豆种一千三百五十斤和稻种一千斤，并普遍做了发芽试验。我希望农民兄弟们都积极行动起来，用提高单位面积产量的实际行动来增加打击美帝国主义的力量。
