Xinhua News Agency, March 21st Dispatch: The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the Head Office of the People's Bank of China issued a joint directive on agricultural production loan work for 1952. The directive stated: This year's agricultural loans should be issued in coordination with the patriotic production increase movement, based on the principles of helping farmers organize, improving technology, and developing production. The focus of this year's agricultural loans should be on the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects, prevention and control of pests and diseases, purchase of breeding livestock, and procurement of new-style farm tools. When issuing loans for farmland water conservancy, local People's Banks may reach a maximum of 50 percent of the total regional allocation. Loans to state-owned farms should primarily be limited to short-term turnover needs for production.

The directive pointed out: In terms of regional allocation, this year's agricultural loans will focus on regions with a higher degree of commercialization of grain production and industrial raw material crop areas. At the same time, newly land-reformed areas, impoverished mountainous regions, and special areas such as fishing and animal husbandry should be taken into consideration. The purpose of agricultural loan work in industrial raw material crop areas is to help farmers improve technology and increase yield per unit area; in general crop areas, it is to supply fertilizers, construct water conservancy projects, purchase pest and disease control equipment, acquire breeding livestock and draft animals, develop sideline occupations and handicrafts serving the rural areas; in pastoral and mountainous areas, it is to maintain and breed livestock, strengthen transportation, promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and support the development of local and special products. People's Banks in various localities should use agricultural loan work to reward farmers for organizing; therefore, the target of agricultural loan issuance should be mass (farmer, fisherman, herder) organizations and production mutual aid groups, encouraging farmers to collectively use agricultural loans. Farmers who are already organized in production should be given priority for loans and have their interest rates appropriately reduced.

The directive requires agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and aquatic product departments of local people's governments and the People's Bank to cooperate with each other, investigate local economic and financial situations and the specific production needs of farmers before issuing loans, review whether the production plans and loan purposes of borrowers are reasonable during loan issuance, and check whether the loans are actually used for production after loan issuance. People's Banks in various localities must also strive to absorb and organize the masses' own funds for production, and if necessary, consult with the local People's Government Financial and Economic Committee to appropriately allocate local grain or mobilize private bank funds for lending through state banks. When promoting new-style farm tools and improved varieties, agricultural, forestry, and aquatic product departments of local people's governments should cooperate with state banks to implement loan transfers in order to save cash. Agricultural, water conservancy, and aquatic product departments of people's governments and the People's Bank should also attach importance to the timely recovery of loans.

The Head Office of the People's Bank of China recently telegraphed its regional and branch banks, instructing them to issue the loans already approved for this year in a timely manner, in coordination with local drought prevention and resistance work, and to first solve the production difficulties of the people in disaster areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 21st Dispatch: The East China Military and Administrative Committee issued a directive on the 20th, calling on all farmers in the East China region to launch a mass patriotic agricultural production increase competition movement. The directive pointed out: This movement is an important link in implementing spring plowing production tasks, completing the annual patriotic production increase plan, and further developing labor mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The competition should include two aspects: first, strive for an overall increase in the production of various crops; second, create new records in the yield of certain crops. Localities should take labor models, mutual aid groups, agricultural production cooperatives, and state-owned farms as the backbone, absorb the broad masses of farmers to participate, and proceed according to the principles of mobilizing at all levels, assigning responsibility at each level, organizing meticulously, guiding concretely, and developing universally, in order to achieve the goal of universally improving the yield per unit area. The competition can take the form of joint challenges and joint responses. Units or individuals participating in the competition should, through democratic discussion, formulate a concrete, achievable, and active patriotic production increase competition plan, and earnestly avoid formalism. In order to further promote the mutual aid and cooperation movement forward, consolidate and improve existing labor mutual aid groups, the conditions for competition between groups and between regions should include the quality and quantity of organization. The directive requires people's governments at all levels to designate a group of specialists to be responsible for leading this movement, to regularly inspect participants in the competition, to help solve difficulties, and to ensure the completion of the competition plan. People's governments above the county level should establish award evaluation committees to mobilize the masses to evaluate and summarize in the summer and autumn seasons. After the autumn harvest, each county should convene a labor model conference, hold an agricultural production exhibition, and elect representatives to attend the provincial (regional) labor model conference and the East China labor model conference. Localities should announce award methods when launching the competition to encourage the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers to participate in the competition.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 21st Dispatch: The East China Regional People's Bank has begun issuing agricultural loans. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of agricultural products, the East China Regional Bank has decided to increase agricultural loans by nearly 30 percent this year compared to last year. More than half of these are fertilizer loans, and the rest are general agricultural loans (small-scale farmland water conservancy, equipment, new-style farm tools, livestock, etc.) and large-scale water conservancy, fishery, and forestry loans. Currently, the People's Banks in various parts of the East China region have begun issuing loans in coordination with relevant agencies, in order to avoid violating the farming season.

    中央农业部和人民银行发布联合指示
    及时发放农贷配合爱国丰产运动
    华东区发动农业增产竞赛运动并开始发放农业贷款
    【新华社二十一日讯】中央人民政府农业部和中国人民银行总行发布关于一九五二年度农业生产贷款工作的联合指示。这个指示说：今年的农贷应该配合爱国丰产运动，在帮助农民组织起来，提高技术，发展生产的原则下发放。今年农贷的重点应放在兴修小型水利、防治病虫害药械、购买种畜、添置新式农具方面。各地人民银行在发放农田水利贷款时，最高额可达到地区总分配数百分之五十。对于国营农场的贷款，主要以生产上短期周转的需要为限。
    指示指出：在地区分配上，今年农贷着重在粮食生产商品化程度较高的地区和工业原料作物区，同时，应照顾新近完成土地改革地区、贫乏的山岳地区和渔、牧业等特殊地区。农贷工作的目的，在工业原料作物区是帮助农民提高技术，增加单位面积产量；一般农作物区是供应肥料，兴修水利，购置防治病虫害药械，添置种畜、耕畜，发展副业和为农村服务的手工业，在牧区和山区是保养和繁殖牲畜，加强运输，促进城乡物资交流，扶助土、特产的发展。各地人民银行应通过农贷工作奖励农民组织起来，因此，发放农贷要以群众（农民、渔民、牧民）组织、生产互助小组为对象，鼓励农民集体使用农贷。对于已经在生产上组织起来的农民，要优先给以贷款，酌予减低利息。
    这个指示要求各地人民政府的农林、水利、水产等主管部门和人民银行互相配合，在贷款前调查当地经济、财政情况和农民在生产上的具体要求，在贷款时审查借款户生产计划和贷款用途是否合理，贷款后要检查贷款是否确实用于生产。各地人民银行并须尽量吸收和组织群众自有资金，用于生产，必要时可和当地人民政府财经委员会洽商，酌拨地方粮或动员私营银行资金通过国家银行贷放。各地人民政府农林、水产等主管部门在推广新式农具、优良品种时，要和国家银行相配合，实行贷款转账，以便节省现金。各地人民政府农业、水利、水产主管部门和人民银行并应重视贷款如期收回的工作。
    中国人民银行总行日前并已电示各地区行、分行，要他们把本年度已经核定的贷款，配合当地防旱、抗旱工作，及时贷放，并且首先解决灾区人民的生产困难。
    【新华社上海二十一日电】华东军政委员会二十日发布指示，号召全华东区农民开展一个群众性的农业爱国增产竞赛运动。指示指出：这一运动，是贯彻春耕生产任务、完成全年爱国增产计划、进一步发展劳动互助合作组织的重要环节。竞赛应包括两个方面：一、争取各种农作物全面增产；二、创造某几种农作物的产量新纪录。各地应以劳动模范、互助组、农业生产合作社和国营农场为骨干，吸收广大农民参加，根据层层发动、按级负责、细致组织、具体指导、普遍开展的原则进行，以达到普遍提高单位面积产量的目的。竞赛的方式可采取联合挑战，联合应战，由参加竞赛的单位或个人，经过民主讨论，订出有具体目标的、积极可行的爱国增产竞赛计划，切实避免流于形式主义。为了进一步推动互助合作运动向前发展，巩固和提高现有的劳动互助组，组与组间、地区与地区间的竞赛条件，都应包括组织起来的好坏、多少。指示要求各级人民政府指定一批专人分工负责领导这一运动，对参加竞赛者要经常进行检查，帮助解决困难，保证完成竞赛计划。县以上人民政府应成立评奖委员会，在夏秋两季发动群众评比总结。秋后各县均应召开劳动模范会议，举办农业生产展览会，并选举出席省（区）劳动模范会议和华东劳动模范会议的代表。各地在发动竞赛时应公布奖励办法，以鼓励广大农民参加竞赛的积极性。
    【新华社上海二十一日电】华东区人民银行开始发放农贷。为了争取农产丰收，华东区行今年决定发放的农业贷款比去年增加近百分之三十，其中半数以上是肥料贷款，其余是一般农业贷款（小型农田水利、药械、新式农具、牲畜等）和大型水利、渔业、林业贷款。现在，华东区各地人民银行已协同有关机关，开始发放，以求不违农时。
