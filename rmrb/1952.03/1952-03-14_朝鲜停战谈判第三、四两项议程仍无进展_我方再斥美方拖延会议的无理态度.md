    【Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 13th】At the March 13th meeting of the subcommittee on the fourth agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations, our representative pointed out that in the fourteen days since the resumption of the meeting, our side has made every effort to resolve the issues and promote the progress of the meeting. However, the other side has never taken any positive steps; on the contrary, it is determined to delay the meeting, actively engaging in negative actions to counteract our positive efforts, resulting in no progress after two weeks of resumption, even after our side put forward reasonable proposals for resolving the fourth agenda item. Our representative once again stated that our side will never accept the act of detaining our captured personnel under the smokescreen of "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation." The other side's insistence on doing so is by no means an attitude of consultation to resolve the problem.
    At the staff meeting on the third agenda item, our side pointed out that if the other side is truly sincere in abiding by the agreement not to introduce reinforcements of weapons and ammunition during the armistice, there is no reason to demand more than five designated ports of entry for weapons and ammunition, and even less reason to refuse the participation of countries that fully meet the definition of neutral nations in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, or to refuse to grant neutral inspection teams the necessary power to inspect weapons and ammunition to ensure compliance with this agreement. On the issues of rotation and ports of entry, our side put forward a reasonable compromise proposal as early as February 23rd. On the issues of the nomination of neutral nations and the inspection powers of the neutral inspection teams, our side had already put forward reasonable solutions. Our side can never agree to any attempt to force our side to make unilateral concessions. Furthermore, our side cannot allow any provisions to be made in the armistice agreement that create conditions and excuses for violating the agreement after the armistice.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三、四两项议程仍无进展
    我方再斥美方拖延会议的无理态度
    【新华社开城十三日电】三月十三日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程小组委员会上，我方代表指出复会以来的十四天里，我方尽了一切的努力，以求解决问题，促成会议进展。但对方从未采取任何积极的步骤，相反地却决心拖延会议，积极于消极的行动，以抵消我方的积极努力，以致复会了两个星期，并且在我方提出解决第四项议程的合理建议后，仍然毫无进展。我方代表再一次声明以“自愿遣返”或“不得强迫遣返”的口号为烟幕，扣留我方被俘人员的行为，我方决不会接受。对方坚持那样做，绝不是协商解决问题的态度。
    第三项议程参谋会议上，我方指出对方如果确有诚意遵守停战期间不进入增援性的武器弹药的协议，就没有任何理由要求多于五个特定口岸作为武器弹药的进口口岸，更没有任何理由拒绝完全符合于中立国定义的国家参加中立国监察委员会，拒绝给予中立国视察小组以视察武器弹药所必需的权力来保证这一协议的遵守。我方在轮换与口岸问题上，早在二月二十三日就提出了合理的折衷方案。我方在中立国提名问题上和中立国视察小组视察权力的问题上，更早已提出了合理的解决方案。我方决不能同意任何强求我方作单方面让步的企图。我方更不能容许在停战协定中作出任何规定，预先为停战后破坏协定制造条件与藉口。
