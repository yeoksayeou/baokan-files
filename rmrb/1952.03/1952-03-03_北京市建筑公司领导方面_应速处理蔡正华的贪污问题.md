To the Leadership of the Beijing Construction Company:

    Cai Zhenghua, the Director of the Party Committee Office of the Beijing Construction Company, has serious embezzlement issues. When he was the Deputy Section Chief of the Transportation Section of the Beijing Military Control Commission, he embezzled gold bars, silver ingots, watches, and other items that were received. After the anti-corruption movement began, he became the Director of the Savings Inspection Committee Office of the Beijing Construction Company. In two self-criticisms, he only confessed to some trivial waste issues and did not mention anything else. He instructed Wang Dezhang, the Chief of the General Affairs Section, to withdraw 20 million yuan from the "small treasury" to lend at usurious interest rates and then tore up the accounts. Under pressure from the masses, Wang Dezhang was forced to initially confess to embezzling 1 million yuan, but Cai Zhenghua stopped Wang Dezhang, saying, "I have talked with General Manager Li, your problems are almost confessed, work hard in the future!" When the superiors came to check the accounts, he even approved Wang Dezhang's request for "sick leave." Wang Dezhang has not returned to work since. Taking advantage of leading the anti-corruption movement, he illegally hid the letters from the masses reporting him in his pocket. The company's anti-corruption movement has been greatly affected by his actions. We request the leadership of the Party Committee of the Beijing Construction Company to promptly address the issue of embezzler Cai Zhenghua.

    北京市建筑公司领导方面
    应速处理蔡正华的贪污问题
    编辑同志：中共北京市建筑公司党委会办公室主任蔡正华有严重贪污问题。他在任北京市军管会交通科副科长时，曾侵吞接收的金条、元宝、手表等物。反贪污运动开始后，他竟当了北京市建筑公司节约检查委员会办公室主任。在两次检讨中，他只交代了些鸡毛蒜皮的浪费，其他一点不谈。他曾指使庶务股股长王德彰从“小家底”中提款二千万元放高利贷，还把账撕了。在群众压力下，王德彰被迫初步坦白了贪污一百万元，蔡正华就阻止王德彰说：“我和李总经理谈过，你的问题交代得差不多了，以后好好工作吧！”上级来检查账目时，他竟批准王德彰请“病假”。王德彰到现在还没有回来。他借领导反贪污运动之便，非法地把群众对他的检举信藏到口袋里。该公司的反贪污运动，因他的关系已受到了很大的影响。我们要求中共北京市建筑公司党委会领导方面迅速处理贪污分子蔡正华的问题。
