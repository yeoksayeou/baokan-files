    How Does a Small Stream Become a Mighty River?
    ——How the Soviet Production Competition Was Carried Out?
    Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Moscow, Li He
    (I) Starting from a Conservation Movement
    In January, a huge competition movement, called "Reducing Metal Consumption in Every Product," was launched in machinery manufacturing enterprises across the Soviet Union. It was initiated by young workers at the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory and popularized throughout the country. Now, this movement is still continuing.
    Saving raw materials has long been an important part of the competition in various Soviet enterprises. The Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory also has a good tradition in this regard: its wrought iron workshop alone saved 2,300 tons of metal last year. However, the factory's young workers and technicians saw that the country's need for metal was growing day by day. Therefore, when exploring potential capabilities to successfully complete the 1952 production tasks, they actively explored ways to save metal. As a result, in early January, young workers in several workshops simultaneously discovered new potential for saving metal by improving technology, utilizing waste materials, improving quality, and reducing rejects. For example, the youth team in the wrought iron workshop decided to save 476 tons of metal this year by improving technology, utilizing waste materials, and reducing rejects. The Communist Youth League members in the General Design Department—designers and experimenters—decided to work with technicians and workers to improve some automobile parts and key structures so that steel and bakelite could be used to replace non-ferrous metals, which would save 1,700 tons of iron and 90 tons of non-ferrous metals this year. All the young people in the tool management department of the die-casting and machining workshops decided to reduce the allowable amount of scrap when processing each object by repairing tools and die-casting machines multiple times, and use waste materials to reduce the consumption of good steel, so that they could work for eighty days this year with the saved materials. …
    In this way, the Communist Youth League members and young people of the Stalin Automobile Factory proposed a comprehensive competition to reduce metal consumption in every product. The characteristic of this movement is that it combines the effort to save materials in each product with the effort to improve product quality and improve production technology.
    The initiators of the competition are Communist Youth League members and young people, and it is actively supported by the factory's Communist Youth League organization. To ensure the success of the competition, the Communist Youth League organization proposed the establishment of joint groups and inspection stations and teams. The joint group is composed of designers, technicians, and advanced workers, and is responsible for studying and implementing proposals related to improving machine parts and key components and reducing metal consumption. The task of the youth inspection stations and teams is to inspect the storage, transportation, and use of materials, and to urge the implementation of rationalization proposals for saving metal.
    After the new competition proposal was put forward, the factory's Party committee immediately convened a meeting of Party and administrative leaders, listened to the report of the secretary of the Communist Youth League committee, and decided on specific organizational and technical measures to implement this proposal, such as convening a meeting of activists and a meeting of technical representatives. In this way, the competition initiated by Communist Youth League members and young people, with the enthusiastic support of the factory leaders, spread like a tide within the factory.
    From early January to the end of January, 196 joint groups were established in various workshops, and they received 1,214 rationalization proposals, most of which have been adopted; it is estimated that 8,000 tons of pig iron and 660 tons of non-ferrous metals will be saved in a year. In this competition movement, young workers got closer to the Communist Youth League: many young workers put forward requests to join the Communist Youth League.
    This example shows that the factory leadership, through the factory's Party, trade union, Communist Youth League organizations, and administrative system, timely discovers and quickly supports advanced people and advanced experiences in production, and uses concrete rather than formalistic methods to ensure the promotion of this experience. This is the decisive factor in making certain advanced experiences form a new proposal and making a new proposal become a factory-wide movement.
    (II) Regarding Advanced Experience as National Wealth
    When the initiative of "Reducing Metal Consumption in Every Product" was just emerging in the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory, when the factory leadership was just beginning to discuss this initiative, the Ministry of Industry, the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League actively promoted it. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League supported this proposal, called on Communist Youth League committees at all levels to promote it, and awarded the initiators with honorary certificates from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. Soviet Minister of Automobile and Tractor Industry Khlamov spoke to a reporter from the Communist Youth League's Truth Daily, pointing out that this initiative has great national significance and instructed all enterprises under the ministry to promote it. The Moscow Municipal and State Committees of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Trade Union of Automobile and Tractor Industry also made the same call.
    It is very natural for advanced experiences of national significance to receive such treatment in the Soviet Union. Because the basic principle of production competition is to help the laggards catch up to the level of the advanced; and advanced experience is the most convincing example and method to reach a higher level. Because advanced experience of national significance is such a national wealth, it can not only add unlimited income to the country, but also inspire the wisdom of workers and create endless progress. From the movement to save raw materials to the comprehensive movement to save raw materials, from the comprehensive movement to save raw materials to the movement to reduce metal consumption in every product, it is a step-by-step advance.
    Like many other new proposals of national significance, the initiative to save metal in every product was enthusiastically responded to and quickly spread to machine manufacturing enterprises in Moscow and to machine manufacturing enterprises across the country. From the Urals to the Baltic coast, many companies have launched this movement.
    From this, a truth can be seen: a new initiative goes to the entire factory with the support of the factory leadership; similarly, a new initiative goes to the whole country with the support of a certain industrial ministry and the Party, the trade union or the Communist Youth League. The support of a certain industrial ministry and the Party, the trade union or the Communist Youth League is the decisive factor for a new proposal to become a national movement and for a small stream to become a mighty river.
    (III) Newspapers Have the Mission of Promoting Advanced Experience
    Newspapers played an outstanding role in promoting the movement of "Reducing Metal Consumption in Every Product." Let's look at the situation in which four newspapers published it. The Truth Daily and the Communist Youth League's Truth Daily on January 9th, the Labor Daily on January 18th, and the Moscow Truth Daily on January 9th and 12th all published special articles introducing this proposal. The Communist Youth League's Truth Daily on January 10th and the Moscow Truth Daily on January 11th also published editorials. From January 9th to 19th, the Truth Daily and the Labor Daily, and the Communist Youth League's Truth Daily and the Moscow Truth Daily continued to publish news about the launch and development of the movement until early February.
    The Communist Youth League's Truth Daily reported on this movement in particularly detailed manner. It published communications written by the initiators of the movement. It sent reporters to interview the Minister of Automobile and Tractor Industry about the relevant issues. It published communications from various enterprises responding to the movement. It and local Communist Youth League newspapers jointly organized inspection teams (including Communist Youth League activists, advanced workers, foremen, technicians, designers, rationalization proposers, etc.) to inspect the progress of the movement. It commended those companies that promoted the movement well and criticized those companies that did not promote the experience seriously or were slow to promote it.
    In the Soviet Union, it is not only a certain newspaper that adopts the above attitude towards a certain competition movement; all the newspapers we have seen adopt such a principled attitude towards all competition movements. This shows that Soviet newspapers are powerful broadcasting stations for advanced experience.
    From the Soviet newspapers we come into contact with on a daily basis, it is not difficult to understand their principles for treating advanced experience. This principle is: to pay attention to and discover advanced experience at all times; to actively support and vigorously disseminate valuable experience; and to continue disseminating until it becomes the possession of the masses.
    Soviet newspapers have developed a custom: to regard it as an honor to first publish valuable new initiatives and promote them to the end. For example, this is the case with the Truth Daily for the Kovalev method, the Labor Daily for the initiative to find new potential forces, and the Communist Youth League's Truth Daily for the proposal to save metal consumption in every product. Soviet newspaper staff maintain close contact with staff in various enterprises, and there are newspaper activists in various enterprises (the heads of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in the enterprises regard writing for the Party newspapers, trade union newspapers, and Communist Youth League newspapers as glorious social work), so newspapers can timely reflect the situation of various enterprises completing their production plans. At the same time, Soviet newspaper staff are well aware of the laws of economic development in socialist society and are well aware of the Party and government's current production policies, so they can distinguish the value of advanced experience and pay due attention to it.
    When Soviet newspapers start a competition movement and organize the introduction of advanced experience, they always invite the initiators of the competition or the factory director, chief engineer, Party committee secretary, trade union chairman, or Communist Youth League committee secretary of the enterprise, that is, the people who know the advanced experience best, to write articles, so that they can introduce a certain experience most clearly.
    When Soviet newspapers launch competition movements, they do not simply publish the production records of certain advanced people or the production achievements of certain enterprises. They also often compare strengths and weaknesses, expose shortcomings, and criticize individual units or individuals for the formalistic or indifferent attitude they adopt towards advanced experience and competition movements.
    Soviet newspapers also often publish economic essays by economic researchers, such as the potential capabilities of industrial enterprises, saving and reducing costs, economic accounting, labor discipline, etc. These essays theoretically, or by raising experience to theory, explain the various factors in developing production. This can help workers and enterprise staff to give full play to their wisdom.
    Therefore, it should be one of the missions of newspapers to quickly promote the advanced experience generated within one enterprise to all enterprises, and to quickly promote the advanced experience generated in one economic sector to all economic sectors.

### 小流怎样变成巨川？——苏联生产竞赛是怎样开展的？

    小流怎样变成巨川？
    ——苏联生产竞赛是怎样开展的？
    新华社驻莫斯科记者  李何
    （一）从一个节约运动说起
    一月份，苏联全国各地机器制造业企业展开了一个巨大的竞赛运动，叫做“在每一个产品上减低金属的消耗运动”。它是由莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂青年职工发起而普及到全国去的。现在，这个运动还在继续开展着。
    节约原料、材料，早就是苏联各部门企业竞赛中的一个重要内容。莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂在这方面也有良好传统：仅仅它的锻铁车间在去年就节约了金属二千三百吨。但是工厂的青年工人和技师们看到了国家建设对于金属的需要一天天增长，因此在为胜利完成一九五二年生产任务发掘潜在能力的时候，更积极地向节约金属方面发掘。结果，一月初，几个车间的青年职工，从改进技术、利用废料、提高质量、减少废活等等方面，同时发现了节约金属的新的潜在能力。例如，锻铁车间的青工组决定用改进技术、利用废料和减少废活的方法，在今年节约四百七十六吨金属。总设计部的青年团员——设计员和实验员，决定与技师和工人一起改进一些汽车零件和关键的结构，使得可以用钢和电木来代替有色金属，这样今年将节约一千七百吨铁和九十吨有色金属。压模和机械加工车间的工具经管处的全体青年，则决定经过多次修复工具和压模机，减低对每一物件加工时所允许的作废额，利用废料来减低好钢的消耗，使得今年可以用节约的材料工作八十天。……
    这样，斯大林汽车工厂的团员和青年们，就提出了全面地在每个产品上减低金属消耗的竞赛。这个运动的特点在于：把在每个产品上节约材料的努力，和提高产品质量以及改善生产技术的努力，结合起来。
    竞赛的发起人是团员和青年，它受到工厂青年团组织的积极支持。为了保证竞赛的成功，团组织提出了建立联合组和检查站、检查队。联合组由设计师、技师和先进工人组成，负责研究和实现有关改进机器的零件与关键以及减低金属消耗的建议。青年检查站、检查队的任务是检查材料的保管、传送和使用，督促实行节约金属的合理化建议。
    新竞赛建议提出以后，工厂的党委会立即召开了党和行政领导人的会议，听取了团委员会书记的报告，决定了召集积极分子会议和技术代表会议等在组织上和技术上实现这个建议的具体办法。这样，由团员和青年发起的竞赛，在工厂领导的热烈支持下，就在厂内潮水一般泛滥开了。
    从一月初旬到一月底，各车间建立了一百九十六个联合组，它们收到了一千二百一十四个合理化建议，这些建议的大部分已经被采纳；总计一年内将节约八千吨生铁和六百六十吨有色金属。在这个竞赛运动中，青年职工更靠近了青年团：许多青年职工提出了入团要求。
    这个例子说明：工厂的领导经过厂内党、工会、青年团组织和行政系统，及时地发现和迅速地支持生产中的先进人物和先进经验，利用具体而不是形式主义的办法，保证这个经验的推广，是使某些先进经验结成一个新建议，使一个新建议变成全厂运动的决定性因素。
    （二）把先进经验看作国家财富
    当“在每一个产品上减低金属的消耗”这一倡议，刚在莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂露出苗头的时候，当工厂领导上才开始讨论这个倡议的时候，工业部、党、工会、团就纷纷提倡它了。青年团中央支持这个建议，号召各级团委会推广它，并且以青年团中央荣誉状授给发起人。苏联汽车与拖拉机工业部部长赫拉莫夫对共青真理报记者发表了谈话，指出这个倡议有巨大的全国意义，责成该部所有企业推广它。苏联共产党莫斯科市委和州委、汽车与拖拉机工业工会中央委员会也作出了同样的号召。
    有全国意义的先进经验，在苏联通常受到这样的待遇，是很自然的。因为生产竞赛的基本原则，就是帮助落后者提高到先进者的水平；而先进经验就是走到更高水平的、最令人信服的榜样和办法。因为有全国意义的先进经验是这样一种国家财富，它不但能为国家增添无限的收入，而且还能启发劳动者的智慧，造成无穷的进步。从节约原料、材料运动到全面节约原料、材料运动，从全面节约原料、材料运动到在每一个产品上减低金属的消耗运动，是一步步前进的。
    像许多别的有全国意义的新建议一样，在每一个产品上节约金属的创举受到热烈响应，很快地普及到莫斯科各个机器制造企业去，普及到全国各地机器制造企业去。从乌拉尔到波罗的海沿岸，许多企业都展开了这个运动。
    从这里可以看出一个真理：一个新倡议是在工厂领导的支持之下走到全厂去的；同样的，一个新倡议是在某一工业部和党、工会或青年团的支持之下走到全国去的。某一工业部和党、工会或青年团的支持，是一个新建议变成全国性运动，一个小流变成巨川的决定性因素。
    （三）报纸负有推广先进经验的使命
    在推动“在每一个产品上减低金属的消耗”这个运动方面，报纸起了出色的作用。拿四个报纸登载的情形来看。真理报、共青真理报在一月九日，劳动报在一月十八日，莫斯科真理报在一月九日和十二日都刊载专文，介绍这个建议。共青真理报在一月十日，莫斯科真理报在一月十一日还发表了社论。真理报和劳动报从一月九日到十九日，共青真理报和莫斯科真理报一直到二月初，连续不断地登载有关运动的发动和发展的消息。
    共青真理报对于这个运动报道得特别详细。它发表了运动发起人所写的通讯。它派记者向汽车与拖拉机工业部部长作了有关的访问。它发表了各企业响应的通讯。它和地方青年团报纸联合组织检查队（参加检查队的有共青团积极分子、先进工人、领班、技师、设计师、合理化建议者等），检查运动的进行情形。它表扬那些把运动推广得好的企业，批评那些把经验推广得不认真、推广得迟的企业。
    在苏联，不是只有某一个报纸对某一个竞赛运动采取上述的态度的；我们见过的所有报纸对所有竞赛运动都采取这样的原则态度。这说明苏联报纸是先进经验的强有力的广播台。
    从我们日常接触的苏联报纸上，不难领会到它们对待先进经验的原则。这个原则就是：时刻地注意和及时地发现先进经验；积极地支持和大力地传播有价值的经验；传播到底，不到它成为群众所有时决不罢休。
    苏联报纸已经养成一种风气：以首先发表有价值的新创举并把它推广到底为光荣。例如，真理报对于郭瓦廖夫方法，劳动报对于寻找新潜在力量的创举，共青真理报对于在每一个产品上节约金属的消耗的建议，就是如此。苏联报纸工作人员和各企业工作人员保持密切联系，各企业中有报纸的积极分子（企业中党、工会、青年团组织的负责人把为党报、工会报、团报写稿当作光荣的社会工作），因此报纸能够及时地反映各企业完成生产计划的情况。同时，苏联报纸工作人员深知社会主义社会的经济发展规律，深知党和政府关于生产的当前政策，因此能够辨别先进经验价值的大小，而加以应有的注意。
    苏联报纸在一个竞赛运动开始，在组织先进经验的介绍时，总是约请竞赛的发起人或该企业的厂长、总工程师、党委书记、工会主席、团委书记，也就是最知道先进经验的人写稿，因而能够最清楚地介绍某一经验。
    苏联报纸在开展竞赛运动时，不是单纯地发表某些先进人物的生产纪录或某些企业的生产成绩。它们还经常比较长短，揭发缺点，批评个别单位或个人对先进经验、对竞赛运动所采取的形式主义或冷淡的态度。
    苏联报纸也经常发表经济研究人员的经济论文，如像工业企业的潜在能力、节约和减低成本、经济核算、劳动纪律等等。这些论文从理论上，或者把经验提高到理论上来，说明发展生产的各个因素。这样是可以帮助工人和企业工作人员发挥智慧的。
    所以，把一个企业内产生的先进经验，迅速地推广到所有企业中去，把一个经济部门中产生的先进经验，迅速地推广到所有经济部门中去，应该是报纸的使命之一。
