    The Inevitable Bankruptcy of the West European Armament Expansion Plan
    Ji Qing
    In order to accelerate the West European arms expansion and war preparation movement and to intensify the establishment of a "European Army" with the West German army as its backbone, U.S. imperialism, at the Lisbon Conference held from February 20 to 25, coerced its vassal states of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc to pass the plan to organize the so-called "European Army" and Harriman's West European arms expansion plan. This is clearly a criminal plan by the United States to use West European countries to prepare for another world war and to further bind West European countries to the U.S. war machine.
    The "European Army" plan adopted at the Lisbon Conference is actually a plan to rearm West Germany. This plan stipulates that West Germany establish a twelve-division army to join the "European Army"; West Germany will thereby become a member of the "European Defense Community," and the "European Defense Community" will "operate within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." Harriman's West European arms expansion plan stipulates that West European countries must establish a fifty-division army by the end of this year and that West European countries must increase their military spending by more than 1.1 billion U.S. dollars in the next three years. It can be seen how eager U.S. imperialism is to accelerate the establishment of the West European aggressive army under the command of Eisenhower, and how frantically it longs to revive the Nazi army of West Germany, in order to push its war plan forward and prepare to provoke a new war.
    What was the result of the Lisbon Conference? U.S. Secretary of State Acheson said with forced enthusiasm after the Lisbon Conference: "I am deeply satisfied with our achievements." However, facts have proved that the future of U.S. imperialism's arms expansion and war preparation in Western Europe is very bleak. The results of the Lisbon Conference fully prove that U.S. imperialism's West European arms expansion and war preparation plan is a completely bankrupt plan, and at the same time, it has aroused more widespread and stronger opposition and resistance from the people of West European countries. The French people have first given the Lisbon Conference's arms expansion and war preparation plan a heavy blow. The Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a letter to the people on February 16, calling on all French people to unite and act in unison to strive for peace, oppose the rearmament of West Germany, and restore France's independence. Due to the strong opposition of the French people, the French Faure government, which accepted the new task of preparing for war imposed on France at the Lisbon Conference, collapsed on the fourth day after the end of the Lisbon Conference. The direct reason for the collapse of the Faure government was its failure to pass in the French National Assembly the fiscal bill that required a 15 percent tax increase in order to raise the new military budget allocated to France by the Lisbon Conference. This fact even forced the United Press to admit in panic that the political crisis in France caused by the opposition of the French people "threatens to overturn the achievements of the Lisbon meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Council." This made the U.S. ruling clique, which pinned its war plan on the "achievements" of the Lisbon Conference, feel very frustrated. An AFP dispatch from Washington on February 29 said: "The U.S. government is alarmed by the new French government crisis" because this matter "indicates France's refusal to fulfill its obligations undertaken at the Lisbon Conference." Now, another French reactionary leader, Pinay, has reluctantly formed a new French government and will continue to follow U.S. orders to accelerate the implementation of the arms expansion and war preparation plan, but this does not mean that the French reactionaries have safely passed through the political and economic crisis in France caused by their traitorous policies. On the contrary, as long as the arms expansion and war preparation plan does not stop for a day, this crisis will definitely continue to develop. The French people's continued struggle will give the U.S. and French imperialists' arms expansion and war preparation plan an increasingly serious blow.
    Throughout West Germany, the movement against rearmament and against West Germany's participation in the "European Army" is continuing to flourish. Workers in West Germany have successively held strikes to oppose the conclusion of the so-called "peace agreement," the "conscription law," and West Germany's participation in the "European Army"; West German youth have held many protest demonstrations and torchlight parades, resolutely opposing the implementation of a conscription system in West Germany. Many religious figures in West Germany, as well as ordinary members of the bourgeois reactionary parties, the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party, have also vehemently opposed the Bonn puppet government's decision to participate in West European war preparations, and have also participated in widespread protest movements. On the other hand, the West German people warmly welcomed and supported the proposal made by the government of the German Democratic Republic to the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to conclude a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible. This fully demonstrates the German people's desire for peace. The German people's struggle for peaceful reunification and against rearmament is a serious and insurmountable obstacle in the criminal path of U.S. imperialism and its Bonn puppet government in reviving the Nazi army.
    The people of other West European countries also resolutely oppose the rearmament of West Germany and the West European arms expansion resolution of the Lisbon Conference.
    The difficulties of the U.S. West European arms expansion plan and the "European Army" plan to rearm West Germany are so great that even the United Press cannot help but "very much doubt whether these plans will be realized." At the Brussels Conference of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc in December of the year before last, it was stipulated that nearly seventy-five divisions should be established in Western Europe by the end of this year, but at this Lisbon Conference, because this "paper plan" could not be realized, it was forced to be reduced to fifty divisions. Even this goal of fifty divisions is still an unrealizable "paper plan." U.S. and West European bourgeois news agencies have made relatively close-to-fact estimates of the West European arms expansion plan adopted at the Lisbon Conference: the United Press said: "Even if the European economy goes well—which is impossible—and the Korean War really ends and the amount of weapons delivered increases, the official figure 'around fifty divisions' does not seem to be possible for the time being"; AFP believes that the Lisbon Conference "only set goals, and the methods to achieve these goals have yet to be discovered." Even if the United States and its lackeys in Western Europe completely disregard the firm opposition of the people of various countries and want to act recklessly, they cannot overcome the growing contradictions between them and the economic difficulties they encounter.
    Although the United States forced its vassal states in Western Europe to accept the new task of arms expansion and war preparation at the Lisbon Conference, this heinous pressure cannot quell the dissatisfaction of its servant countries. As reported by the U.S. reactionary Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, "France and Italy protested that too much was being asked of them." Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, who attended the Lisbon Conference, openly stated at the meeting: "Free countries are unwilling to contribute such a large part of their resources to defense as considered in the plans discussed here." What is even more serious is the dispute between France and Germany, such as the Saar issue, the issue of limiting West German arms production, and the issue of West Germany's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which have not and cannot be completely resolved. All of these will inevitably lead to more intense disputes between imperialist countries once again. This situation has caused Acheson himself to be deeply worried. In a radio address to the entire United States on February 29, Acheson pointed out that the "European Army" plan and the West European arms expansion plan adopted at the Lisbon Conference will all be submitted to the parliaments of various countries for discussion, and "these discussions will cause problems in many countries." And said: "Yesterday's debate and vote in the French National Assembly (referring to the collapse of the Faure government) illustrates the problems that this will cause." Due to the unpopularity of the West European arms expansion plan and the growing contradictions between the United States and its West European servants, the foundation of the arms expansion and war preparation plan accepted by Western European countries under the coercion of the United States is extremely fragile.
    However, the problem is not just that. The seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that the economic crisis caused by arms expansion and war preparation in the U.S. West European servant countries has exhausted their economic strength, and they have no strength to complete the war preparation tasks newly assigned to them by the Lisbon Conference. Acheson also had to admit in his speech on February 29: "Our European friends have serious economic problems." Britain's three-year arms expansion plan of 4.7 billion pounds has been publicly announced to be delayed due to financial and economic difficulties. Even in order to save the increasingly serious financial and economic crisis (in fact, this crisis cannot be saved at all if arms expansion and war preparation are not stopped), the British Churchill Conservative government has been forced to decide to "give priority to the materials needed to produce export commodities over the expansion of the arms program." Churchill said that if this is not done, "we will neither be able to straighten up our armaments nor exist as a self-sufficient economic society." The situation in France is even more serious, as evidenced by the fact that the Faure government collapsed because it could not raise funds for arms expansion and war preparation. Pinay, the reactionary leader of the right-wing Independent Republican Party who replaced Faure's bankrupt policy and organized a new government, repeatedly lamented in the French National Assembly that "France's finances are increasingly depleted" and that "France is on the verge of disaster." It can be seen that the same fate of the Faure government is waiting for the Pinay government; the future of the French reactionaries continuing to implement the U.S. arms expansion and war preparation orders will not have other results except for complete economic bankruptcy and further arousing the firm opposition of the French people. The situation in other West European countries such as West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg is not much better. Huge military expenditures have created huge deficits in the finances of these countries and caused phenomena such as malignant inflation, soaring prices, and increased unemployment, forming a serious economic crisis. In this difficult situation, all West European countries have pinned their hopes on U.S. handouts, asking the United States to take out a few more dollars to help them. Former French Prime Minister Faure openly stated to his U.S. master during the Lisbon Conference: "Unless France receives a large amount of dollar aid, it will be short of four of the fifteen divisions allocated to it this year." But the pockets of U.S. tycoons are not so generous. The U.S. Congress has already been arguing and clamoring to cut Truman's huge arms expansion and "foreign aid" budget. U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder publicly stated after the Lisbon Conference: "The cost of West European rearmament in the long run is mainly a matter for Europe itself," and resolutely closed the door to increasing the so-called "U.S. aid" to West European countries. Originally, "U.S. aid" for West European countries was just "drinking poison to quench thirst," and could not solve the economic crisis in West European countries at all, and now even "U.S. aid" is hopeless, then the bankruptcy of the economy of West European countries that rely on U.S. handouts to barely survive and the final bankruptcy of the West European arms expansion plan accepted by West European countries under the coercion of the United States at the Lisbon Conference are already doomed.
    From this, people can believe that, due to the increasing opposition of the people of West European countries and the peace-loving people of the world, and due to the contradictions between the United States and its West European servant countries and its own difficulties, the U.S. arms expansion and war preparation plan in Western Europe is bound to continue to suffer serious failures. The West European arms expansion and war preparation plan adopted at the Lisbon Conference cannot be realized.

    Workers in many cities in Italy hold strikes to protest the towering crime of the United States spreading bacteria
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The people and public opinion in Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland have protested against the towering crime of U.S. aggressors conducting germ warfare.
    People all over Italy continue to protest the U.S. aggressors' germ warfare in Korea. In the province of Modena, the Peace Committee, trade unions and Communist Youth League have all lodged protests. Workers in eight large factories held symbolic strikes to protest. In many large cities in various provinces - Florence, Livorno, Piombino, Ferrara, Reggio, Milan, Bologna and other places, workers have issued protests against the U.S. aggressors. The Peace Committee of Grosseto Province has also issued a statement denouncing the United States for conducting germ warfare in Korea. According to the Italian Socialist Party organ "Avanti!" Milan cadres of the Italian Socialist Party passed a resolution against germ warfare.
    According to the Italian Communist Party organ "Unità," on the 14th and 15th, the Italian people will hold many large-scale protest rallies, one of which will be organized by the National Association of Partisans, trade unions and the Italian Women's League.

    必然破产的西欧扩军计划
    纪清
    美帝国主义为了加紧进行西欧扩军备战运动，加紧建立一支以西德军队为骨干的“欧洲军”，在二月二十日至二十五日举行的里斯本会议上，胁迫其北大西洋侵略集团的附庸国家通过了组织所谓“欧洲军”的计划和哈里曼的西欧扩军计划。这显然是美国企图利用西欧国家准备另一次世界大战并把西欧国家进一步缚在美国战车上的罪恶计划。
    里斯本会议所通过的“欧洲军”计划，实际上是重新武装西德的计划。这个计划规定：西德建立十二师的军队加入“欧洲军”；西德并由此而成为“欧洲防御集团”的一个成员，而“欧洲防御集团”又“将在北大西洋公约组织内活动”。哈里曼的西欧扩军计划则规定西欧国家要在今年年底以前建立五十师的军队，并要西欧各国在今后三年内增加十一亿多美元的军费。可以看出：美帝国主义是如何急切地希望加紧建立起归艾森豪威尔统率的西欧侵略军，是如何疯狂地渴望着复活西德的纳粹军队，以便将它的战争计划向前推进一步，准备挑动新的战争。
    里斯本会议的结果是什么呢？美国国务卿艾奇逊在里斯本会议结束后强打精神地表示：“我对我们的成绩深感满意”。然而事实证明美帝国主义在西欧扩军备战的前途是很黯淡的。里斯本会议的结果充分证明了美帝国主义的西欧扩军备战计划完全是一个破产的计划，同时并激起了西欧各国人民更为普遍、更为强烈的反对和抵抗。法国人民已首先给里斯本会议的扩军备战计划以沉重的打击。法国共产党中央委员会于二月十六日发表了告人民书，号召全体法国人民联合起来，为争取和平、反对重新武装西德，恢复法国的独立而一致行动。由于法国人民的坚强反对，在里斯本会议上接受了加给法国备战新任务的法国富尔政府，便在里斯本会议结束后的第四天垮台了。富尔政府垮台的直接原因是在法国国民议会内通不过它为筹措里斯本会议加给法国新的军备预算而要求增税百分之十五的财政法案。这个事实甚至使美国合众社也不得不惊慌地承认，由于法国人民的反对而造成的法国的政治危机“大有推翻北大西洋公约理事会里斯本会议的成就之势”。因而使得把它的战争计划寄托在里斯本会议的“成就”上的美国统治集团感到十分沮丧。法新社二月二十九日从华盛顿发出的电讯说：“美国政府对新的法国政府危机表示惊惶”，因为这件事“表示法国拒绝履行它在里斯本会议上承担的义务”。现在，另一个法国反动头子比内已勉强组成了新的法国政府，并且将继续遵从美国的命令加紧执行扩军备战计划，但这并不表示法国反动派已安然度过了由它们的卖国政策所造成的法国的政治和经济的危机，相反的，只要扩军备战计划一天不停止，这种危机就一定会继续发展的。法国人民再接再厉的斗争，将给美法帝国主义的扩军备战计划以日益严重的打击。
    在西德各地，反对重新武装和反对西德参加“欧洲军”的运动也正在继续蓬勃展开。西德各地工人为反对缔结所谓“和平协定”，反对“征兵法”和西德参加“欧洲军”，先后举行了罢工；西德青年举行了许多次抗议示威、火炬游行，坚决反对西德实行征兵制度。西德许多宗教界人士以及资产阶级的反动政党基督教民主党和社会民主党的普通党员，也都激烈反对波恩儡傀政府参加西欧备战的决议，也都参加了广泛的抗议运动。而另一方面，西德人民对于德意志民主共和国政府向苏、美、英、法四国提出的要求早日缔结对德和约的建议，热烈地表示欢迎和拥护。这充分说明了德国人民爱好和平的意愿。德国人民要求和平统一、反对重新武装的斗争，是横阻在美帝国主义及其波恩傀儡政府复活纳粹军队的罪恶道路上的不可克服的严重障碍。
    西欧其他各国人民也都坚决反对重新武装西德和里斯本会议的西欧扩军决议。
    美国的西欧扩军计划和重新武装西德的“欧洲军”计划的困难是如此之大，以至使合众社也不能不“非常怀疑这些计划是否会兑现”。北大西洋侵略集团在前年十二月的布鲁塞尔会议上曾规定到今年年底要在西欧建立近七十五个师，而在这次里斯本会议上由于这个“纸上计划”无法实现，已被迫减为五十个师。就是这五十个师的目标也依然还是实现不了的“纸上计划”。美国及西欧的资产阶级通讯社，对里斯本会议所通过的西欧扩军计划都曾作过比较接近于事实的估计：合众社说：“即使欧洲经济一切顺利——这是不可能的——朝鲜战争真正结束而使武器交货量增加，官方所宣布的数字‘五十师左右’似乎也并非一时可能办到的”；法新社则认为里斯本会议“只不过是定出了目标，而实现这些目标的方法尚待发现”。即使美国及其西欧各国的仆从们完全不顾各国人民的坚决反对，而要蛮干到底，它们也不能克服它们相互之间的日益增长的矛盾和它们在经济上所遭遇到的困难。
    美国在里斯本会议上虽然强迫着它在西欧的各附庸国接受了扩军备战的新任务，但是这种穷凶极恶的压力并不能平息它的仆从国家的不满。如美国反动的斯克利浦斯霍华德系报纸的报道说：“法国和意大利都抗议说要求他们的太多了”。出席里斯本会议的挪威外交大臣兰基则在会议上公开表示：“自由国家不愿像此间所讨论的计划中所考虑的那样，以它们的资源中这样大的一部分来贡献于国防”。而更严重的是法德之间的争吵，如萨尔问题，如限制西德军火生产问题，如西德的参加北大西洋公约问题，都没有而且也不可能得到彻底的解决。所有这些都不免要再一次引起帝国主义各国之间更为激烈的争吵。这种情形使艾奇逊自己也深深引为忧虑。艾奇逊在二月二十九日向美国全国发表的广播演说中，就曾经指出里斯本会议所通过的“欧洲军”计划和西欧扩军计划，都将要提交各国议会讨论，而“这些讨论将在许多国家中引起问题”。并说：“法国国民议会昨天的辩论与投票（指富尔政府的垮台）就说明了这将引起的问题”。由于西欧扩军计划的不得人心，由于美国及其西欧仆从相互之间的矛盾的日益增长，美国迫使西欧国家所接受的扩军备战计划的基础是极端脆弱的。
    然而问题还不仅如此，问题的严重在于美国的西欧仆从国家由于扩军备战所造成的经济危机，已使它们的经济力量陷于枯竭，根本没有力量完成里斯本会议新加给它们的备战任务。艾奇逊在他二月二十九日所发表的演说中也不得不承认：“我们的欧洲朋友们有着严重的经济问题”。英国的四十七亿英镑的三年扩军计划，迫于财政经济的困难已公开宣布延缓了。甚至为了挽救越来越严重的财政经济危机（事实上如果不停止扩军备战这种危机是根本无法挽救的），英国的邱吉尔保守党政府已被迫决定将“生产出口制成品所需要的物资，放在较扩大军备计划更为优先的地位”。邱吉尔说，假如不如此做的话，“我们就既不能整顿军备，也不能作为一个自足自给的经济社会而存在了”。法国的情况尤为严重，富尔政府因为无法筹措扩军备战经费而垮台的事实，便是明证。接替富尔的破产政策而组织新政府的法国右翼独立共和党的反动头子比内，在法国国民议会中也一再发出“法国财政日益涸竭”，“法国已临灾难边缘”的悲鸣。可以看出：富尔政府的同样命运也在等待着比内政府；法国反动派继续执行美国扩军备战命令的前途，除了经济上的彻底破产并更加引起法国人民的坚决反对之外，是不会有其他的结果的。其他的西欧国家如西德、意大利、荷兰、比利时、卢森堡等国的情形也并不稍好。庞大的军费开支已在这些国家的财政上造成了巨额的赤字，并引起恶性通货膨胀、物价飞涨和失业增加等现象，形成了严重的经济危机。在这种困难的情形下，西欧各国都把它们的希望寄托在美国施舍上，要求美国多拿出几个钱来接济它们。法国前总理富尔在里斯本会议期间，就曾公开向它的美国主子表示：“除非法国得到大批美元的援助，今年分配它的十五个师，要缺四个师”。但是美国财主的口袋也并不是那样宽裕，美国议会早已在七嘴八舌地争吵着要削减杜鲁门的庞大的扩军和“援外”预算。美国财政部长斯奈德在里斯本会议后即已公开声明：“西欧重整军备的费用长期说来主要是欧洲自己的问题”，而向西欧各国断然关闭了增加所谓“美援”的大门。本来“美援”对于西欧各国来说，只是“饮鸩止渴”，决不能解救西欧各国的经济危机，而现在甚至连“美援”也渺茫无望，那末依靠美国的施舍而苟延残喘的西欧各国经济的破产和美国在里斯本会议上强迫西欧各国所接受的西欧扩军计划的最后破产是已经注定了的。
    由此人们可以相信，由于西欧各国人民和世界爱好和平人民日益增强的反对，由于美国及其西欧仆从国家相互之间的矛盾及它本身的困难，美国在西欧的扩军备战计划是必然要继续遭受到严重的失败的。里斯本会议所通过的西欧扩军备战计划，是无法兑现的。
    意大利许多城市工人举行罢工  抗议美国撒布细菌的滔天罪行
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：意大利、荷兰和瑞士各国的人民和舆论，纷纷抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行。
    全意大利各地的人民继续抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜进行细菌战。在摩登纳省，和平委员会、工会和共产主义青年团都提出了抗议。八家大工厂的工人举行象征性的罢工，表示抗议。在各省许多大城市——佛罗伦萨、里窝那、皮奥宾诺、斐拉拉、雷科、米兰、波伦亚等地，工人都发表了对美国侵略者的抗议。格罗塞托省和平委员会也发表声明，痛斥美国在朝鲜进行细菌战。据意大利社会党机关报“前进报”消息，米兰意大利社会党的干部通过了决议，反对细菌战。
    据意大利共产党机关报“团结报”消息，十四、十五两天，意大利人民将要举行许多大规模的抗议集会，其中有一个会是全国游击队协会、工会和意大利妇女联盟组织的。
