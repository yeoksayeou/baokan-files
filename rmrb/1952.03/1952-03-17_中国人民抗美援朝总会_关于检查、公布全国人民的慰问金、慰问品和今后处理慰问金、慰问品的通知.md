China People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea
Notice Regarding the Inspection and Publication of National People's Comfort Funds and Goods, and Future Handling of Comfort Funds and Goods
(Zong Zi No. 1)

As of January 21st of this year, the General Association has received RMB 182,857,241,030 (including some book and newspaper funds, comfort goods funds, etc.) in comfort funds from the people of the whole country for the Chinese People's Volunteers. Among them, RMB 149,173,828,113 was transferred to the Association by the People's Bank of China on behalf of the people of the whole country; and another RMB 33,683,412,917 was directly remitted to the Association by the original donation organizations and individuals through the local People's Banks or post offices. Regarding the above-mentioned donations directly remitted to the Association, the Association has completed the inspection and clearing and published the details in the People's Daily in Beijing on February 23rd. Newspapers in various places that have not yet reprinted it are requested to reprint it. At the same time as receiving the above-mentioned comfort funds, the Association received a large number of comfort goods donated by people from all over the country to the Chinese People's Volunteers. Except for a small portion recently received that is being packaged and transported to the front, the rest of the comfort goods have been transferred to the front by the logistics organs of the Chinese People's Volunteers. In order to summarize and clear the work of the people's comfort funds and goods and improve future work, the General Association, in addition to vigorously and conscientiously clearing and thoroughly investigating the above two tasks, has specially stipulated the following measures, and requests the general sub-committees and sub-committees of the Resistance to US Aggression and Aid Korea in various places and other relevant organs and units to implement them in conjunction with the current Three-Anti Movement.

(A) Regarding the Inspection and Clearing of Comfort Funds and Goods
    (1) The general sub-committees, provincial, municipal, and county (banner) sub-committees in various places should earnestly carry out this work, organize special personnel to review and settle the accounts of the income, remittance, and expenditure of comfort funds and goods, and at the same time, verify all relevant documents and files to check whether there is any corruption or errors in the receipt and remittance procedures. The clearing work should be basically completed before the end of May this year. However, in rural areas, it is hoped that attention will be paid to not affecting farmers' production.
    (2) After the completion of the inspection of comfort funds, the sub-committees (or grassroots branches) at all levels in various places must publish the details of the addresses, names, and amounts of the donors (including individuals and units) in accordance with the methods specified in the "General Situation of Donations for Resistance to US Aggression and Aid Korea" published by the Association on February 22nd this year; and call on all donors to review the published materials and report any errors or corruption. The methods of publication by the sub-committees of the Resistance to US Aggression and Aid Korea in various places can use local newspapers or post announcements, or use other forms of publication, regardless of the form and method, it must be published to the masses. (Because the names of comfort goods are complicated and the number is too large, it is difficult for the sub-committees in various places to summarize and publish them in the newspapers. The method of publication by the grassroots donation units can be adopted.) In order to carry out this work well, the spirit of "layer-by-layer verification and responsibility everywhere" should be implemented. (That is, if the original donor hands over the donation to the donor unit, the receiving unit should promptly publicize the names and amounts of the donors it has received to the masses, and the unit that receives the donation should also verify with the local sub-committee of the Resistance to US Aggression and Aid Korea or the People's Bank of China whether there are any errors in the donation it has paid.)

(B) Regarding the Future Handling of Comfort Funds and Goods:
    (1) In order to avoid waste, if the people, organs, and groups in various places donate books, newspapers, magazines, or comfort goods to the Volunteers in the future, it is hoped that they will donate in cash instead, so as to avoid the donated goods not meeting the needs of the front, resulting in difficulties in handling.
    (2) In order to simplify procedures and facilitate future audit and publication of accounts, the Association has signed a contract with the People's Bank of China to collect "Donations to Comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers" (including all donations such as book and newspaper funds). If the people, organs, groups, schools, or individuals in various places have donations to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers, please directly pay them to the local People's Bank of China for collection (and the collecting bank will issue a receipt). In areas without a People's Bank of China, they can be remitted through the local post office to the nearest People's Bank of China for collection. Therefore, it is hoped that the people in various places will no longer remit all donations to the General Association or the general sub-committees of the Resistance to US Aggression and Aid Korea in major administrative regions and the municipal and county sub-committees (the method of collecting donations agreed upon by the Association and the People's Bank of China is attached separately).
    (3) All donations from the people of the whole country are uniformly allocated by the General Association of Resistance to US Aggression and Aid Korea according to the needs of the Chinese People's Volunteers at the front. The sub-committees of the Resistance to US Aggression and Aid Korea or any other organs or units in various places have no right to spend this donation. If you have any opinions, you can inform the Association.
    (4) The sub-committees of the Resistance to US Aggression and Aid Korea in various places should cooperate with the local People's Bank of China to periodically publicize the comfort funds donated by the people to the People's Volunteers in accordance with the method of the collection contract signed by the General Association and the People's Bank of China.

    中国人民抗美援朝总会
    关于检查、公布全国人民的慰问金、慰问品和今后处理慰问金、慰问品的通知
    （总字第一号）
    总会截至今年一月二十一日止收到全国人民慰问我国人民志愿军的慰问金已达人民币一千八百二十八亿五千七百二十四万一千零三十元（包括一部分书报代金，慰问品代金等）。其中有一千四百九十一亿七千三百八十二万八千一百十三元，系由全国人民经各地中国人民银行代收转汇本会的；另有三百三十六亿八千三百四十一万二千九百十七元系由原捐款机关，个人直接由各地人民银行或邮局寄汇总会的。关于上述直接寄汇总会的捐款部分，本会已检查清理完毕并于二月二十三日在北京人民日报公布了细目。各地大报纸尚未转载者希予以转载。与上述收到慰问金同时期，本会收到全国各地人民捐献给我国人民志愿军的大批慰问物品。此项慰问品除最近收到的一小部分正在包装运送前方外，其余均经中国人民志愿军后勤机关转送到前方。为了总结和清理人民慰问金、慰问品的工作和改进今后工作起见，总会本身除已大力认真清理彻查上述二项工作外，特规定如下办法，请各地抗美援朝总分会、分会及其他有关机关和单位结合目前的三反运动，遵照实行。
    （甲）关于检查、清理慰问金、慰问品
    （一）各地总分会、省、市、县（旗）分会应认真地进行此项工作，要组织专人审查清算慰问金、慰问品的收入、上解、开支的账目，同时要核对一切有关的单据和文件，审查其中是否有贪污或收寄手续上的错误，清理工作，应在本年五月底以前基本完毕。但在乡村中希望注意不要影响农民的生产。
    （二）各地各级分会（或基层支会）于慰问金的检查工作完成后均必须按照本会今年二月二十二日所公布的：“一般抗美援朝捐款的情况”内所定办法公布捐献者（包括个人和单位）的地址姓名、数目等细目；并号召各捐献者对所公布的材料审核和检举有无错误或被贪污等情事。各地抗美援朝分会公布的方法，可利用当地报纸或贴榜发表，或利用其他形式公布，不管何种形式和方法，一定要向群众公布。（慰问品因名目繁杂，数目太多，各地分会汇总统计在报上公布有困难，可采取基层捐献单位公布的办法。）为了把这工作进行的好，应贯彻“层层核对，处处负责”的精神。（即原捐献者将捐款交给本捐献单位，则该代收单位应将自己所受的捐款者的姓名和数目及时向群众公布，该代收款的单位也应与代收捐款的当地抗美援朝分会或人民银行核对自己所缴的捐款有否错误。）
    （乙）关于今后处理慰问金、慰问品的办法：
    （一）为了避免浪费，各地人民和机关、团体今后如再捐赠给志愿军书报刊物或慰问物品等时，均望以现金代捐，以免所捐物品等不合前方需要，致处理困难。
    （二）为了简化手续，便于今后审核和公布账目起见，本会已与中国人民银行订立代收“慰问中国人民志愿军捐款”合同（包括书报代金等一切捐款）。各地人民和机关、团体、学校或个人若有慰问中国人民志愿军的捐款，请直接缴到当地中国人民银行代收（并由该代收银行代出收据）。如果没有中国人民银行的地区，可经当地邮局汇解就近地区的中国人民银行代收。因此希望各地人民将所有捐款不要再解汇总会或各大行政区的抗美援朝总分会和市县分会（本会与中国人民银行所订立的代收捐款办法另附）。
    （三）全国人民的一切捐款，依据中国人民志愿军前方的需要，均由抗美援朝总会统一调拨。各地抗美援朝分会或其他任何机关或单位，均无权动支此项捐款，如有意见时可告知本会。
    （四）各地人民捐给人民志愿军的慰问款，各地抗美援朝分会应按照总会与中国人民银行所订代收合同的办法协同当地中国人民银行定期向人民公布。
