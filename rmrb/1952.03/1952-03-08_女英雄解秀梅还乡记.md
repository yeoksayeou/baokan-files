In the North China sub-delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation was a female meritorious worker named Xie Xiumei. She came to Baoding with the North China sub-delegation. The news caused a sensation in Xie Xiumei's hometown, Yuti Village in Gaoyang County, and the surrounding villages. Everyone thought: since she has come to Baoding, she will definitely come home to visit. So, people prepared a warm welcome for her.

The people of these villages had already produced many heroes in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War; however, their nineteen-year-old daughter, Xie Xiumei, had performed meritorious service on the Korean front, which was a first. Therefore, the villagers welcomed Xie Xiumei even more joyfully than celebrating the Spring Festival. Almost every street and every courtyard had been swept. A stage was set up in the village entrance, ready to invite Xiumei to speak on stage. Xiumei's parents and sisters kept looking out at the village entrance to see if Xiumei had returned.

On February 21st, Xie Xiumei returned. Representatives from the Volunteer Army's homecoming delegation and the Korean People's delegation to China also came with her. The Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, the Commissioner of Baoding Prefecture, the County Head of Gaoyang County, comrades from the Gaoyang County Women's Federation, and comrades from the film team also came.

A sixty-year-old woman, Aunt Han, squeezed into the core of the crowd. Xiumei threw herself into her arms. Aunt Han touched Xiumei's face and said, "Girl! I want to see you, this Mulan, who should be remembered for generations! Our whole village should be honored!" Xiumei's mother was squeezed to the side by the crowd. She happily said, "Let everyone see her, she is not only my girl now, she is everyone's treasure!" Xiumei's seventy-year-old grandmother, who used to think that girls should not be involved in writing, now saw this grand scene and heard people say, "This is really thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership!" She smiled and clapped her hands, saying, "Yes! Yes!"

More than six thousand people came to participate in the celebration meeting. People stared intently at the girl wearing a flower on her chest and the father and mother wearing flowers on the stage. Tian Bo, the head of the North China sub-delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army homecoming delegation, said to everyone on the stage: "She is a role model for girls!" Shen Guozhen, the head of the North China sub-delegation of the Korean People's delegation to China, told the people: "The Korean people will always remember the hero and her parents' names in their hearts."

People warmly welcomed Xiumei to speak. The female hero introduced her deeds. She said: "I was a member of the cultural troupe on the front line. Like my comrades, I climbed ice mountains, slept in the snow, sang for the soldiers, and performed for the soldiers; in the hospital, I cared for the wounded. Once, I had just returned from collecting firewood on the mountain, preparing to heat the kang for the wounded; suddenly nine enemy planes came, and gasoline bombs set the ward on fire. I immediately dropped the firewood and rushed into the fire, carrying a seriously wounded soldier out. Not far after running out, the enemy planes rushed down at us again. The wounded soldier said: 'Put me down and hurry up and hide, don't get hurt again for an injured person.' I said: 'I am a member of the Youth League, I can't let you get hurt a second time, if I am here, you are here.' I put the wounded soldier on the ground, and I laid on top of him to protect him. A bomb landed in front of us, and the dirt buried us. After the enemy planes passed, the wounded soldier was not injured again, but my own arm bled. I finally sent the wounded soldier to a safe area. Later, I was approved to join the Communist Party of China." Xiumei finally said: "I was just doing things according to the instructions of the people of the motherland, thank you for welcoming me like this, I will definitely continue to make greater contributions for my elders!" Her relatives applauded even more enthusiastically to praise their excellent daughter. Xiumei was moved to tears.

Representatives from the Volunteer Army's homecoming delegation and the Korean People's delegation to China, the government leaders who came to participate in the celebration, and representatives from twenty-one villages, personally went to Xie Xiumei's home to congratulate her. The two small mud houses had long been decorated with joy. The "Home of Glory" plaque jointly presented by the masses of twenty-one villages, and the congratulatory messages sent by the delegation and the government, were hung all over the walls. The small house was filled with laughter. Her mother was so happy that she told Xiumei: "Don't worry about the family, the government and the villagers are taking good care of us. Your father can weave cloth, and the public provides us with foreign yarn. He processes and weaves it into cloth, and the wages alone are enough for our whole family to eat, and all the produce from the land is surplus." Xie Shuyuan, a fifty-four-year-old farmer, said: "Xiumei is performing meritorious service in the front for the sake of our production in the rear. My family has livestock, from now on, I will take care of the plowing and sowing work for your family." The mother of Han Quan, a third-class meritorious soldier of the Volunteer Army, asked Xiumei to send a letter to his son: "Let him make a great contribution and catch up with Sister Xiumei!"

    女英雄解秀梅还乡记
    新华社记者  文英
    中国人民志愿军代表团华北分团里有一位女功臣解秀梅，她跟华北分团一齐来到了保定。女英雄的家乡——高阳县于堤村和附近村庄的老乡们都被这个消息轰动了，大家想着：既然她来到保定，一定会到家里来看看的。于是人们就准备热烈地欢迎她。
    这一带村庄的人民，在抗日战争和人民解放战争中，本来就出现过不少的英雄；但是，他们的姑娘，十九岁的少女解秀梅在朝鲜前线立了功，还算是头一个。所以老乡们欢迎解秀梅，真比过春节还高兴。几乎每一条街道和每一个院子都打扫过了。于堤村全村七百八十多户人家，有六百多家来了亲友。人们在村头搭起了台子，准备请秀梅登台讲话。秀梅的爸爸妈妈和姊妹们，不住地到村头眺望，看看秀梅回来了没有。
    二月二十一日，解秀梅回来了。志愿军归国代表团的代表们和朝鲜人民访华团的代表们也伴随着她来了。河北省人民政府民政厅长、保定专区专员和高阳县县长、高阳县妇联会的同志和电影队的同志也来了。
    一位六十多岁的韩大娘挤到人群的核心去了，秀梅扑到她的怀里。大娘摸着秀梅的脸说：“丫头！我要看看你这个花木兰，该流芳百代吧！咱全村人都该光彩了！”解秀梅的母亲被人们挤在一边去了，她乐的说：“让大伙看看她吧，现在她不光是我的丫头了，她是大伙的香饽饽了！”秀梅的七十多岁的老奶奶，早先老觉着闺女家不能上纸墨，如今看到这隆重的情景，听到人们说：“这真是咱毛主席领导的好！”也笑眯眯地拍着手说：“对呀！对呀！”
    赶来参加庆功大会的有六千多人。人们目不转睛地注视着台上胸前戴花的姑娘和戴花的爸爸、妈妈。中国人民志愿军归国代表团华北分团团长田波在台上向大家说：“她是姑娘们的榜样！”朝鲜人民访华代表团华北分团团长沈国镇告诉人们：“朝鲜人民将永远把英雄和她的父母的名字记在心里。”
    人们热烈欢迎秀梅讲话。女英雄介绍了她的事迹。她说：“我在前线是个文工团的团员。我也像同志们一样爬冰山，卧雪地，为战士们唱歌，为战士们演戏；在医院里护理伤员。一次，我刚从山上打柴回来，准备给伤员们烧炕；忽然九架敌机来了，汽油弹把病房烧着了。我马上丢下木柴钻进火里，背起一个重伤员向外跑，跑出来不远，敌机又向我们冲下来。那位伤员说：‘你放下我赶快躲开，别为一个受伤的人你再受了伤。’我说：‘我是青年团员，不能让你再负第二次伤，有我就有你。’我把伤员放在地上，自己却伏在他的身上掩护着他。一颗炸弹落在了我们的跟前，掀起土来埋住了我们。敌机过去后，伤员没再受伤，我自己的胳膊却出了血，我终究把伤员送到了安全地带。后来，我被批准参加了中国共产党。”秀梅最后说：“我不过按着祖国人民的嘱托去作事，谢谢你们这样来欢迎我，我一定为父老们继续立更大的功！”她的亲人们用更加热烈的鼓掌赞扬自己的优秀的女儿，解秀梅被感动得流下泪来。
    志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团的代表们，来参加庆功的政府首长们和二十一个村的群众代表们，亲到解秀梅家里祝贺。两间小土屋早被人们打扮得喜气洋洋了。二十一个村庄的群众合送的“光荣之家”的匾额、代表团和政府送的贺词挂满了四壁。小房子里充满着笑声。妈妈太高兴了，告诉秀梅说：“不要挂念家，政府和乡亲们照顾得很周到。你爸爸能织布，公家供给咱洋线，他加工织成布，光工钱就够咱全家吃用了，地里的出产全是富裕。”五十四岁的农民解书元说：“秀梅在前方立功，是为的咱们能在后方生产。我家里有牲口，今后你家耕耕耩耩的活，我管起来。”志愿军三等功臣韩泉的母亲，让秀梅给他的儿子捎个信：“让他立个大功，赶上秀梅姐！”
