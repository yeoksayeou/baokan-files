    Directive of the Government Administration Council on the Prevention and Control of Crop Diseases and Insect Pests in 1952
    In 1951, insect pests and diseases of various crops occurred severely, especially locusts, cotton aphids, rice borers, and smut. Thanks to the vigorous leadership of governments at all levels and the active prevention and control by the broad masses, major disasters were fortunately avoided. However, due to insufficient prior estimation of diseases and insect pests, and inadequate preparation of medicines and equipment, the harm caused by diseases and insect pests was not reduced to the smallest possible extent. The climate last winter was relatively warm, and the overwintering mortality rate of pests was not high. It is estimated that locusts, cotton aphids, rice borers and other diseases and insect pests may occur more severely this year. In order to ensure increased production per unit area, governments at all levels must strengthen the organizational work for the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests in accordance with the "Decision on Agricultural Production in 1952" promulgated by this Council. The following instructions are hereby given:
    1.  Grasp the Key Points of Prevention and Control: All areas where diseases and insect pests frequently occur must be highly vigilant and take early precautions, implementing the principle of prevention over treatment. First of all, early spring plowing should be implemented to remove weeds, rice roots, and stubble to reduce the occurrence of cotton aphids and borers. Universal promotion of seed soaking and seed mixing should be carried out to prevent various types of smut and cotton diseases. It is required that Chahar, Suiyuan, and Gansu reduce the incidence of smut to below 5% within three years. Selecting and replacing rust-resistant varieties to prevent wheat stripe rust. In terms of insect pests, we must focus on the prevention and control of the most serious locusts, aphids, borers, and leaf rollers. Establish locust control stations in areas where locusts have been serious in previous years, and eliminate locust nymphs before the third instar. Before the summer harvest, universally control cotton aphids once; after the summer harvest, mobilize all forces to launch a continuous struggle to control aphids. The Yangtze River basin should vigorously control cotton leaf rollers. Rice-growing areas should do a good job in building standardized seedbeds, conduct moth trapping and egg collection, and strictly implement year-round borer control. Shaanxi, Henan, northern Anhui and other places should promote the net-dragging method to prevent wheat midges. Fruit producing areas should focus on using various agents to control major diseases and insects of pears, apples, jujubes, citrus and other fruits. Each region should determine the local key points of prevention and control based on different diseases and insects, and carry out prevention and control using various different methods. For all disease and insect pest control work, the active spirit of "early treatment, universal treatment, continuous treatment, and thorough treatment" must be implemented to the end.
    2.  Fully Prepare Medicines and Equipment: Governments at all levels must prepare medicines and equipment for diseases and insect pests as early and fully as possible, and organize the masses to do a good job in repairing sprayers and dusters. Cottonseed oil soap, tobacco, lime-sulfur mixture, etc. should be supplied as early as possible in accordance with the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on November 21, 1951 and the specifications for cottonseed oil preparations formulated by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, so that they can be allocated and used in a focused manner. We should also focus on organizing the strength of the masses to overcome the idea of simply relying on the government to distribute medicines and equipment. Various effective insecticidal and disease-treating plants such as pyrethrum, yam bean seeds, wild derris, bitter bark, kiwi roots, and potash should also be fully utilized according to local conditions. Regarding the promotion and supply of medicines, demonstration should be carried out in areas where there is no habit of use. In areas where there is a habit of use, a business model should be adopted, and the local cooperatives should handle it. Cotton-producing areas should universally mobilize cotton growers to cultivate tobacco equivalent to 1% of the cotton planting area to ensure an adequate supply of aphid control medicines.
    3.  Strengthen Technical Guidance: Local disease and pest control agencies should master the patterns of disease and pest occurrence and guide the masses to carry out prevention and control in a timely manner. Hold various short-term training courses and seminars to disseminate effective prevention and control methods and the rational combination and use of medicines, and pass on science and technology to the broad masses. Organize technical cadres to go deep into the countryside in conjunction with farms at all levels to provide on-site guidance and solve technical problems. Local experimental research institutions should combine mass experience to research effective methods for preventing and controlling major local diseases and insect pests to improve prevention and control techniques.
    4.  Establish an Information System: Due to the unsound and non-universal nature of past intelligence organizations, the occurrence of diseases and insect pests was often neglected or underreported, or overreported, losing accuracy and timeliness, making it impossible to accurately organize forces to allocate medicines and equipment, and to prevent and control in a timely manner, thereby reducing effectiveness. In the future, a regular intelligence system must be established with the village as the base. Disease and pest control stations should organize an intelligence network under the leadership of the specialized county people's government, especially in areas where locusts, cotton aphids, red spiders, and rice borers frequently occur. The organization of the intelligence network should be more sound and universal, grasp the true situation of the occurrence and development of diseases and insect pests, immediately report it, and organize forces to carry out prevention and control in a timely manner, so that "wherever diseases and insect pests occur, they will be eliminated there."
    5.  Mobilize and organize the masses to universally launch a movement to prevent and control diseases and insect pests. Preventing and controlling crop diseases and insect pests is one of the important measures to realize increased agricultural production. Local people's governments must strengthen the publicity and education of farmers on the patriotic production increase movement, inspire the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests through various meetings, select and commend models, and enhance the masses' confidence in fighting against diseases and insect pests. We must strengthen the leadership of disease and pest control, uniformly allocate manpower and material resources, and centrally organize forces to overcome various difficulties. We must grasp the universality and continuity of pest control and disease prevention, and adhere to the implementation of prevention and control work. At present, we must especially prevent the paralyzing idea of underestimating diseases and insect pests, and actively carry out preventive work.

    政务院关于一九五二年防治农作物病害虫害的指示
    一九五一年各种农作物的虫害和病害曾严重发生，尤以蝗虫、棉蚜、稻螟、黑穗病为最重。经各级人民政府的大力领导和广大群众积极防治，幸未造成大害。但由于事前对病虫害估计不够，药械准备不足，未能将病虫害的为害，减少至可能的最小限度。去冬气候较暖，害虫越冬死亡率不大，估计今年的蝗虫、棉蚜、稻螟和其他病虫害有更加严重发生的可能。为保证单位面积增产，各级人民政府必须遵照本院颁布的“关于一九五二年农业生产的决定”加强防治病虫害的组织工作，特作如下指示：
    一、抓紧防治重心：凡是经常发生病虫害的区域，必须提高警觉，及早预防，贯彻防重于治的方针，首先应实行提早春耕，清除杂草、稻根及谷茬，以减少棉蚜、螟虫等的发生。普遍推行浸种、拌种以预防各种黑穗病与棉病。要求察哈尔、绥远、甘肃在三年内把黑穗病发病率降低到百分之五以下。选换抗锈品种以预防小麦黄锈病。在虫害方面，必须抓紧防治为害最严重的蝗虫、蚜虫、螟虫、卷叶虫。在历年蝗虫严重地区建立治蝗站，必须把蝗蝻消灭在三龄以前；夏收以前，普遍防治棉蚜一次；夏收以后，动员一切力量展开继续不断的治蚜斗争。长江流域应大力防治棉卷叶虫。水稻区要做好合式秧田，进行捕蛾采卵，厉行四季治螟；陕西、河南、皖北等地应推广拉网法防治小麦吸浆虫；果品产区，应有重点地使用各种药剂防治梨、苹果、枣、柑橘等主要病虫。各地针对不同病虫，确定当地防治重心，用各种不同的方法进行防治。对一切病虫防治工作，必须把“早治、普遍治、连续治、彻底治”的积极精神贯彻到底。
    二、充分准备药械：各级人民政府必须及早充分准备病虫药械，组织群众，做好整修喷雾器、喷粉器的工作。对棉油皂、烟草、石灰硫黄合剂等应根据政务院财政经济委员会一九五一年十一月二十一日指示及中央人民政府农业部所定棉油剂规格，及早完成供应计划，以便有重点地配备使用。并应以组织群众力量为主，克服单纯依赖政府发放药械思想。各种有效杀虫治病植物如除虫菊、豆薯子、野生鱼藤、苦树皮、羊桃根、蓬灰等，也必须根据当地条件充分利用。关于药剂的推广供应，在没有使用习惯的地区，应进行重点示范，在已有使用习惯的地区，应采取企业经营的方式，由各地合作社办理。产棉地区应普遍动员植棉户，栽培相当于植棉面积百分之一的烟草，以充裕治蚜药剂的供应来源。
    三、加强技术指导：各地病虫防治机构应掌握病虫发生规律，指导群众适时地进行防治。举办各种短期训练班、座谈会，传播有效的防治方法及药剂的合理配合与使用，把科学技术交给广大群众。并组织技术干部结合各级农场深入农村实地指导，解决技术上的问题。各地试验研究机构应结合群众经验，研求防治当地主要病虫害的有效方法，以提高防治技术。
    四、建立情报制度：由于过去情报组织不健全、不普遍，病虫发生，常忽视不报，或以轻报重，以重报轻，失去正确性与时间性，因而无法精确地组织力量配备药械，适时防治，以致减低效能。今后必须以村为基点，建立经常情报制度。病虫害防治站应在专县人民政府领导下组织情报网，尤其在蝗虫、棉蚜、红蜘蛛、稻螟经常发生地区，情报网的组织更应健全与普遍，掌握病虫发生与发展的真实情况，立即上报，及时组织力量进行防治，要求做到“病虫发生在那里，即消灭在那里”。
    五、发动与组织群众，普遍地开展防治病虫运动。防治农作物病虫害，是实现农业增产的重要措施之一。各地人民政府必须加强对农民进行爱国增产运动的宣传教育，通过各种会议启发群众防治病虫的积极性和创造性，评选与表扬模范，提高群众对病虫灾害作斗争的信心。必须加强病虫防治的领导，统一调配人力、物力，集中组织力量，克服各种困难，必须掌握治虫防病的普遍性与连续性的特点，坚持贯彻防治工作。目前特别要防止对病虫害估计不足的麻痹思想，积极进行预防工作。
    一九五二年三月二十六日
