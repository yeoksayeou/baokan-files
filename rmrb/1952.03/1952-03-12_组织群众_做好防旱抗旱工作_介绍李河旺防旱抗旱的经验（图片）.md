Organize the Masses and Do a Good Job in Drought Prevention and Resistance
Introducing Li Hewang's Experience in Drought Prevention and Resistance
Li Hewang, a model of water conservancy in Chahar Province and an excellent member of the Chinese Communist Party, has actively participated in drought prevention and resistance work since 1950 under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government. He created methods for storing water and preserving ice, as well as digging ice channels to divert water for irrigation. He also extensively organized the masses to carry out water conservancy projects such as digging canals and wells, overcoming difficult natural conditions and achieving a bumper harvest of crops.

Before the ice transportation movement began, the Communist Youth League members in Chaigoubu Town, Huai'an County, held group mobilization meetings, and each Youth League member guaranteed to actively participate in the ice transportation work.

In order to do a good job in drought prevention before the early spring thaw, the women of Chaigoubu Town were also mobilized to participate in the ice transportation work. This is a scene of Zhou Yuying, the director of the Women's Federation, explaining the great significance of the ice transportation work to everyone.

Storing Water and Preserving Ice: Every winter, when the upper layer of the river water forms a solid layer of ice, Li Hewang leads the farmers to first make good "shao nian" (earth embankments blocking the canal entrance) at each canal entrance to seal the canal entrances. Then, they open water holes in the ice layer and use rice straw to block the path of the water flowing under the ice layer. They also dig a small channel in the ice layer near the water hole in the direction of the water flow, so that the river water can flow to the top of the ice layer, thickening the ice layer. This not only allows the ice layer to be broken up and transported to the fields to preserve soil moisture, but also provides enough water for irrigation in the spring after the thaw. Top picture: Li Hewang leads the farmers in digging water holes on the ice layer of the river water. Middle picture: In order to prevent the water on the ice layer from dispersing, Li Hewang also led the farmers to build earth embankments on the ice layer of the river water. Bottom picture: This year, Li Hewang led the farmers of Chaigoubu Town to cultivate 2.5 million cubic feet of ice layer, which can irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land. The farmers are breaking up large ice blocks, preparing to send them to fields where water diversion is more difficult.

Digging Ice Channels to Divert Water for Early Irrigation: Every early spring, Li Hewang leads the farmers to first find the route of the water flowing under the ice layer in the river channel (usually where the ice bulges). Then, they open a water diversion channel on the ice layer, stacking the excavated ice blocks and soil into ice weirs. They then use rice straw to block the river water at the opening, diverting it into the ice channel, so that the water can flow into the canal for irrigation. When digging ice channels to divert water for irrigation, the canal entrances and channels must be guarded by people day and night to prevent ice blocks from blocking the water and causing breaches. Top picture: Farmers are digging ice channels to divert water at the bulging part of the ice layer. Middle picture: Farmers patrol the canal entrances and channels in shifts day and night, and promptly open the ice layer when they find the canal water freezing. Bottom picture: More than 5,000 mu of land in Chaigoubu Town that had not been irrigated with spring water for many years have now been filled with water and frozen into ice before spring plowing.

Men and women, old and young, in Chaigoubu Town work together to load and transport ice blocks on the river.

Mobilize all manpower and use all kinds of methods to transport ice blocks to the fields. In order to take care of the families of martyrs and soldiers, they always transport ice to the fields of the families of martyrs and soldiers first.

After the large ice blocks are transported to the fields, they are crushed and covered with soil, which can preserve soil moisture.

The long ice transportation procession is carrying out the ice transportation work intensely.

Farmers happily carry large ice blocks to fields where water diversion is more difficult.

A radio station is set up at the ice transportation site to report and commend the achievements of activists in the ice transportation work at any time. Manuscript from the Film Studio of the Ministry of Agriculture. Photo by Ye Baoquan.

    组织群众  做好防旱抗旱工作
    介绍李河旺防旱抗旱的经验
    察哈尔省水利模范、优秀的中国共产党党员李河旺，他从一九五○年起，在人民政府的领导和帮助下，就积极地参加防旱、抗旱工作，创造了蓄水养冰和打冰漕引水浇地办法，并广泛地组织群众，进行开渠、打井等水利工程，战胜了困难的自然条件，使农作物获得丰收。
    在运冰运动开始前，怀安县柴沟堡镇的青年团员分别召开了小组动员会，每一个青年团员都保证积极参加运冰工作。
    为了在初春解冻前做好防旱工作，柴沟堡镇的妇女们也动员起来参加了运冰工作。这是妇女会主任周玉英向大家讲解运冰工作重大意义时的情形。
    蓄水养冰每年冬天，当河水上层结成坚固的冰层时，李河旺就领导农民先在每道渠口上作好梢埝（堵渠口的土堰）封好渠口，再在冰层上打开水洞，用稻草把冰层下面的水流去路堵塞，并在水洞附近冰层上循水流方面开一小渠，使河水可以流到冰层上面来，加厚结冰层；这样不但可以将冰层打碎运到地里保墒，并且到春季开冻后，可以有足够的水用来浇地。上图：李河旺领导农民在河水冰层上打水洞。中图：为了不使冰层上的水流散，李河旺又领导农民在河水冰层上做好土埝工作。下图：今年李河旺领导柴沟堡镇农民养成了二百五十万立方尺冰层，可以灌溉一万多亩地。农民们正在进行大块冰层的掘碎工作，准备把它送到引水比较困难的地里去。
    打冰漕提早引水浇地每年春初，李河旺领导农民首先在河漕里找到冰层底下流水的路线（一般冰凸起的地方就是），然后就在冰层上开一条引水漕，把凿出来的冰块和土垒成冰堰，再在开口的地方用稻草把河水挡到冰漕里，这样水就可以流到渠里浇地。在打冰漕引水浇地时，渠口和渠道必须日夜经常有人看管，防止冰块把水堵住发生决口。上图：农民们正在冰层凸起处打冰漕引水。中图：农民们日夜轮班巡视渠口和渠道，发现渠水结冰时就及时把冰层打开。下图：柴沟堡镇多年灌不上春水的五千多亩地，今年都已经在春耕前灌满水，结成冰了。
    柴沟堡镇的男女老少一齐动手，在河上装运冰块。
    动员所有人力，利用各种办法，把冰块运到地里去。他们为了照顾烈、军家属，在运冰的时候总是先往烈、军家属的地里运。
    大块的冰块运到地里后，再把它砸碎用土掩上，这样可以保墒。
    长长的运冰行列，紧张地在进行运冰工作。
    农民们愉快地把大块的冰块抬到引水比较困难的地里去。
    在运冰工地设有广播站，随时报告和表扬在运冰工作中积极分子的成绩。农业部电影社稿。叶保全摄
