    The Shi Caigui Mutual Aid Team Improves Unit Area Yield by Building Water Conservancy Projects
    Yao Guang
    The cultivated land area expanded by thirty-two percent in three years
    The Shi Caigui Mutual Aid Team in Yanjia Village, Jie County, Shanxi Province, collectively reclaimed wasteland and built water conservancy projects, expanding the cultivated land area year by year and significantly increasing the unit area yield. This mutual aid team was established in August 1949. Initially, there were only three households, with an average of just over two mu of dry land per person. Not only was the quantity insufficient, but the quality was also very poor, yielding only two dou of wheat per mu. The whole team had only two small cows, no large farm tools, and the small farm tools were also incomplete. They organized themselves under the common demand of increasing production by expanding the cultivated land area and overcoming the shortage of animal power and farm tools. In the first year of organization, this team collectively reclaimed ten mu of wasteland, and each household received more than three mu. In February 1950, two more households joined the team, and this year a total of twenty-two mu of wasteland was reclaimed. In February 1951, the mutual aid team grew to eight households and reclaimed another ten mu of wasteland. Over the past two years, a total of forty-two mu of wasteland has been reclaimed, of which thirty-two mu have yielded relatively good harvests, producing a total of twenty-two dan, eight dou, and five sheng of wheat. At present, the whole team has a total of one hundred and thirty-one mu of land, and the cultivated land area expanded by wasteland reclamation has reached thirty-two percent.
    Drilling wells for irrigation increased cotton unit area yield by twenty-one percent
    In 1950, there was a drought. It did not rain from April to July, and most of the dry land could not be sown. The Jie County People's Government called on farmers to build water conservancy projects and provided loans to support farmers. Shi Caigui responded to the government's call and led the team members to start planning to drill wells and borrow waterwheels. At that time, some team members were not very enthusiastic about drilling wells. After repeated discussions by the mutual aid team, the slogan "Watering one mu counts as one mu" was put forward, overcoming the passive thinking of relying on the heavens for food, and everyone began to take action. Although the well was drilled, the water volume was not sufficient for application due to quicksand at the bottom of the well, so an old well that had not been used for many years was repaired. After the old well was repaired, it required four laborers every day, three people drawing water and one person managing the irrigation, and it could only irrigate half a mu a day, which was labor-intensive and inefficient. Everyone discussed changing to a waterwheel. However, the well was thirty-six chi deep, and the newly borrowed waterwheel with eight buckets was only twenty-four chi long. Later, five more sections were borrowed, overcoming the difficulties. Using a waterwheel to irrigate the land significantly improved efficiency. One person and one animal could irrigate two and a half mu of land in a day and a half. In the autumn, each mu yielded two hundred and forty jin of seed cotton, which was twice as high as the yield of ordinary dry land.
    In the spring of 1951, just as the team was starting to repair the second old well, the old well that had been repaired the previous year suddenly collapsed, and the waterwheel was damaged and the cow was killed. This unexpected loss hit the team members' enthusiasm for production. Some team members suggested repairing the well in the autumn. At this time, Shi Caigui led everyone to do the math: the collapse of the waterwheel resulted in a loss of twenty-four dan of grain; if the well was repaired, and the seven mu of dry land were all irrigated, and more fertilizer was applied, each mu could yield four hundred and fifty jin of seed cotton, while dry land could only yield ninety jin, and seven mu of land could yield two thousand five hundred and twenty jin more, equivalent to forty-two dan of grain; subtracting the loss of twenty-four dan, there would still be a surplus of eighteen dan. After doing the math, all the team members understood and immediately borrowed money from the government to purchase bricks and lime for repairing the well, and everyone started to work. It was originally planned to be repaired in ten days, but it was completed in five days. Then, two more old wells were repaired. In the past two years, a total of three old wells have been repaired (one of which has not yet been used for irrigation), and sixteen mu of dry land have been turned into irrigated land, increasing production by a total of six thousand one hundred and ninety jin of seed cotton, equivalent to one hundred and three dan and three dou of wheat.
    Due to being organized, building water conservancy projects, and increasing production, the production conditions of the mutual aid team have been greatly improved. Now this team has three cows, five donkeys, two waterwheels, one windmill, one drill, one knife plow (cultivating farm tool), one harrow each, one new-style walking plow, and other small farm tools such as plows, harrows, hoes, ?, shovels, etc., totaling forty-seven pieces, more than one and a half times more than before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Due to overcoming the difficulties of insufficient livestock and farm tools, intensive cultivation has become possible. Before the war, cotton fields were plowed, harrowed, and rolled a total of six times; before liberation, a total of 4.6 times; in 1950, a total of 6.8 times; and in 1951, it reached 7.8 times. In terms of fertilization: before the war, irrigated land averaged thirty dan per mu, in 1950 it was forty-one dan, and in 1951 it reached fifty-one dan. Shi Caigui himself applied thirty dan of fertilizer per mu of irrigated land and fifteen dan of fertilizer per mu of dry land in 1950. In 1951, he applied one hundred and five dan of fertilizer per mu of irrigated land, more than two and a half times more than in 1950. He applied thirty-seven shi and five dou of fertilizer to dry land, more than double that of 1950. Therefore, the unit area yield has been significantly improved. In 1951, the average yield of seed cotton per mu of irrigated land in the whole team was three hundred and fifty-two jin, an increase of twenty-four percent compared to 1950; the average yield of seed cotton per mu of dry land was one hundred and fourteen jin, an increase of twenty-one percent compared to 1950. In 1951, the average yield of wheat per mu of dry land was seven dou and three sheng, an increase of seventeen percent compared to 1950 and an increase of thirty-seven percent compared to before the war.
    Basic reasons for increased production
    In summary, the basic reasons why the Shi Caigui Mutual Aid Team was able to increase production are as follows: (1) It was organized according to the farmers' demand for developing production, and according to the needs of production development, it overcame the farmers' conservatism and carried out undertakings conducive to the development of production in accordance with local conditions, gradually enriching the production content of the mutual aid team. (2) The strong economic support from the People's Government, coupled with the collective investment of the team members, initially solved the difficulties of expanding reproduction. The resources of the Shi Caigui Mutual Aid Team were far from meeting the needs of expanding reproduction, and it was especially vulnerable to natural disasters. Over the past two years, the People's Government has provided a large amount of loans to this mutual aid team, including 8 million yuan for waterwheel loans, 1.8 million yuan for livestock loans, 800,000 yuan for well repair loans, 670,000 yuan for farm tool loans, and 500 jin of black beans, 100 jin of fertilizer powder, 28 jin of cotton oil soap, and 12 dan and 2.5 sheng of grain for pre-purchasing cotton. Especially last spring, after a well in this team collapsed, without the help of the government, not only would the irrigated land have become dry land, but it would have also affected the consolidation of the mutual aid team. Over the past two years, the team members have collectively purchased some large farm tools, which are not only suitable for the economic situation and production needs of the team, but also economically connected each team member, strengthening the collectivity, and thus promoting the consolidation and development of the mutual aid team. Now there are eight more farmers in Yanjia Village (out of a total of twenty-one households in the village) who want to join the Shi Caigui Mutual Aid Team. This mutual aid team plans to expand the organization this year, setting up subgroups under the large group.
    How to continue to improve unit area yield
    According to the specific situation of the Shi Caigui Mutual Aid Team, there are no conditions for continuing to reclaim wasteland and drill wells (because there is no more wasteland to reclaim, and it is not advisable to drill more wells). In order to increase the unit area yield, in the future, efforts should be focused on improving the soil, increasing soil fertility, turning slopes into fertile fields, and further refining cultivation. This requires increasing fertilizer application and combining sideline production to expand income, so as to increase the ability to expand reproduction.
    This team plans to jointly raise forty sheep in 1952, and one person will be drawn from the team to specialize in herding sheep. This will result in forty carts of sheep manure per year, which is equivalent to eighty carts of compost; it can not only increase fertilizer but also obtain income from fur. In addition, they also plan to raise more pigs and borrow black beans and fertilizer powder from the government for top dressing. After applying a large amount of fertilizer and improving the soil, production can be increased by another one-third on the existing basis. Last winter, they started to improve the soil and will complete ten mu by this spring.
    In terms of improving cultivation efficiency, this mutual aid team plans to replace small livestock with large livestock. Because small livestock are less efficient in cultivation, such as irrigating land, small livestock can only irrigate two mu of land a day, while large livestock can irrigate four mu; they plan to try to replace them with one large livestock this spring.

    史采贵互助组兴修水利提高单位面积产量
    姚广
    三年中耕地面积扩大了百分之三十二
    山西省解县阎家村史采贵互助组集体开荒，兴修水利，耕地面积逐年扩大，单位面积产量显著提高。这个互助组是一九四九年八月成立的。最初只有三户，每人平均只有旱地二亩多，不仅数量不足，而且质量也很坏，每亩只产二斗小麦。全组只有两头小牛，没有大农具，小农具也不完全。他们就是在扩大耕地面积、克服畜力农具不足的困难以增加生产的共同要求下组织起来的。组织起来的第一年，这个组集体开荒十亩，每户分了三亩多。一九五○年二月又有两户入组，这一年共开荒二十二亩。一九五一年二月互助组发展到八户，又开荒地十亩。两年来总共开荒地四十二亩，其中收成较好的三十二亩，共产小麦二十二石八斗五。目前全组共有地一百三十一亩，开荒扩大的耕地面积达百分之三十二。
    打井浇地，棉花单位面积产量提高了百分之二十一
    一九五○年天旱，四月到七月没下雨，大部分旱地不能下种，解县人民政府号召农民兴修水利，并贷款扶助农民。史采贵响应政府号召，领导组员开始酝酿打井贷水车。当时有的组员对打井不甚积极。经互助组多次讨论，提出了“浇活一亩算一亩”的口号，克服了靠天吃饭的消极思想，大家才行动起来。井虽打成，但因井底有流沙，水量不够应用，又修理了多年不用的一眼旧井。旧井修复后，每天用四个劳力，三个人汲水，一个人管理浇地，一天只能浇半亩，费工多，效力低。大家商议改用水车。但井深三丈六尺，贷来的新式水车八节斗子只二丈四尺，后来借了五节，克服了困难。用水车浇地，效力显著提高，一个人力一个牲口，一天半就浇了二亩半地，秋后每亩收籽棉二百四十斤，较一般旱地产量提高了两倍。
    一九五一年春季，这个组正动工修第二眼旧井时，前年修好的旧井突然塌了，而且跌坏了水车压死了牛。这意外的损失，打击了组员的生产情绪。有的组员提议到秋后再修复这眼井。这时史采贵领导大家算了一算账：水车倒塌共损失粮食二十四石；如把井修好，七亩旱地都浇上水，再多施肥料，每亩可收籽棉四百五十斤，而旱地只能收九十斤，七亩地可多收二千五百二十斤，折合粮食四十二石；减去二十四石的损失，还余十八石。经过算账后，全体组员都想通了，立即向政府贷款购买了修井的砖和石灰，大家动手修起来。原计划十天修好，结果五天就完成了。接着又修好了两眼旧井。两年来共修旧井三眼（其中一眼还没有浇地），十六亩旱地变成水地，共增产六千一百九十斤籽棉，折合麦子一百零三石三斗。
    由于组织起来，兴修水利，增加生产，互助组的生产条件得到很大的改善。现在这个组已有牛三头、驴五头，水车二辆，风车一辆，耧、刀犁（中耕农具）、耙各一张，新式步犁一具，其他小农具如犁、钯、锄、?、锨等合计四十七件，超过抗日战争前一倍半还多。由于克服了牲畜农具不足的困难，精耕细作成为可能。战前棉田耕、耙、耱共六次；解放前共四点六次；一九五零年共六点八次；一九五一年达到七点八次。施肥方面：战前水地每亩平均三十担，一九五零年四十一担，一九五一年达到五十一担。史采贵本人一九五零年水地每亩上肥料三十担，旱地十五担。一九五一年水地每亩上肥料一百零五担，超过一九五零年两倍半。旱地上肥料三十七石五，超过一九五零年一倍多。因此，单位面积产量已显著提高，一九五一年全组水地每亩平均产籽棉三百五十二斤，比一九五零年提高了百分之二十四；旱地平均每亩产籽棉一百一十四斤，超过一九五零年百分之二十一。旱地小麦一九五一年每亩平均产七斗三升，超过一九五零年百分之十七，超过战前百分之三十七。
    增产的基本原因
    总起来说，史采贵互助组能够增产的基本原因有以下两点：（一）根据农民发展生产的要求组织起来，又根据生产发展的需要，克服农民的保守性，因地制宜地举办有利于发展生产的事业，逐渐充实互助组的生产内容。（二）人民政府在经济上的大力扶持，加上组员的集体投资，初步解决了扩大再生产的困难。史采贵互助组的资力，远赶不上扩大再生产的需要，尤其经不起自然灾害的打击。两年来人民政府曾给这个互助组发放了大量的贷款，计有水车贷款八百万元，牲口贷款一百八十万元，修井贷款八十万元，农具贷款六十七万元，又贷给黑豆五百斤，肥田粉一百斤，棉油皂二十八斤，预购棉花的粮食十二石二斗五升。特别是去年春天，这个组的一眼水井塌了以后，如果没有政府的帮助，不仅水地会变成旱地，而且会影响到互助组的巩固。两年来这个组的组员集资伙买了一些大农具，既适合于组内的经济情况和生产的要求，又使每个组员从经济上联系起来，加强了集体性，因而也促进了互助组的巩固和发展。现在阎家村要求参加史采贵互助组的农民又有八户（全村共二十一户），这个互助组准备今年扩大组织，在大组之下设小组。   
    怎样继续提高单位面积产量
    根据史采贵互助组的具体情况，继续开荒和打井已无条件（因已无荒地可开，井也不宜再打了），为提高单位面积产量，今后应集中力量改良土壤，增加地力，变坡地为良田，进一步精耕细作。这就需要增施肥料并结合副业生产扩大收入，以增加扩大再生产的能力。
    这个组计划在一九五二年合伙养羊四十只，组内抽出一人来专门放羊，这样每年可收羊粪四十车，可顶圈肥八十车；既可增加肥料，又可得到皮毛的收入。此外，还计划多养猪，并向政府贷黑豆及肥田粉作为施追肥之用。经过大量施肥和改良土壤，可以在现有基础上再提高产量三分之一。去冬就着手进行改良土壤，到今春可完成十亩。
    在提高耕作效率方面，这个互助组准备把小牲口换成大牲口。因为小牲口在耕作时效率低，如浇地小牲口一天只能浇地二亩，大牲口就可浇地四亩；准备尽可能争取今春要换上一头大牲口。
