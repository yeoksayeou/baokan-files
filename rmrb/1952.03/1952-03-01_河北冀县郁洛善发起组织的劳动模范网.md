Hebei Jixian County Yu Luoshan Initiates and Organizes Labor Model Network

    The labor model network organized by Yu Luoshan, a labor model from Xishage Village, Second District, Jixian County, Hebei Province, by uniting 48 labor models in the entire district, has proven to be the best method for exchanging and summarizing production experiences and promoting production movements. At the same time, it is also the best organizational form for cultivating and improving labor models.

    The labor model network initiated and organized by Yu Luoshan began in January 1951. In the winter of 1950, after Yu Luoshan attended the First Hebei Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Conference, he wanted to organize a labor model network. He thought that attending one labor model conference could allow you to learn a lot of experience. If labor models could maintain frequent contact, it would be even more beneficial to exchange production experience and promote production movements. He told these ideas to labor models Liu Cuimiao, Ji Fenglou, Guo Xiucai, and others in nearby villages, and they all agreed. In January 1951, the district people's government convened a county and district labor model conference, and Yu Luoshan brought up this idea at the meeting, which was immediately supported by all the labor models present. Subsequently, the 48 labor models present freely formed nine groups according to the distance between their villages. Each group elected a group leader, and the dates and locations for the meetings of the groups and group leaders were also stipulated. (The role of the group meeting is to exchange production experience and study the production situation and problems of each village. The group leader meeting is to study the production experience and problems raised by each group, and promote some of the more mature experiences to each group; problems that cannot be resolved at the group leader meeting will be submitted to the district people's government for resolution.) From then on, the labor model network began to be established. After a year of experience, the labor model network has the following advantages:

    First, it can timely understand and grasp the ideological situation of the peasant masses, inspire their enthusiasm for production, and help the leading organs strengthen their leadership in agricultural production. For example, when aphids occurred in cotton fields in this district in 1951, the peasants generally did not have a sufficient understanding of the harm caused by aphids at first; Yu Luoshan emphasized the importance of controlling aphids at the labor model group leader meeting and led the study of methods to mobilize peasants to control aphids. In this way, the aphid eradication movement in each village quickly unfolded. Later, the peasants in each village found that it was still not easy to eliminate aphids after one or two rounds of general treatment, and they became tired of it. Even some labor models lost confidence in controlling aphids. Yu Luoshan convened another temporary group leader meeting to mobilize again and further studied methods to control aphids. In this way, the mass aphid eradication movement continued to be carried out and the scale became even larger. Because the aphid control movement in each village under the leadership of the labor model network was launched earlier and was more thorough, the result was that each mu of cotton field harvested thirty catties more of seed cotton than ordinary villages in the autumn.

    Second, it can systematically and purposefully exchange production experiences in a timely manner according to the agricultural season and current production needs. In the spring of 1951, when the peasants were carrying out a fertilizer accumulation campaign, Yu Luoshan timely introduced the method of digging water pits to silt mud as fertilizer from Xishage Village to various villages, which played a great role in the fertilizer accumulation campaign; only Dongshage, Xishage, Xianzhuang and other five villages transported more than 2,000 large carts of silt mud. The labor model network not only frequently paid attention to absorbing and promoting the production experience created by peasants, but also frequently publicized and promoted the experience learned from leading organs and newspapers to peasants. For example, when the newspaper published scientific methods of improving toilets and storing wood ash and human urine separately for fertilizer accumulation, the labor model network repeatedly publicized it to the peasants, so that most peasants accepted it.

    Third, the labor model network can frequently educate and cultivate labor models, and point out the direction for the leading organs to cultivate labor models. In the past, leading organs had no effective methods to frequently cultivate and educate labor models except for convening labor model conferences. Facts have proved that the labor model network is the best organizational form for cultivating and educating labor models. This organizational form can not only organize labor models and use them to implement the government's production policies and leadership intentions among the masses, but also enable labor models to frequently check each other and observe each other through their meeting system, so as to carry out criticism and self-criticism, improve their political understanding, and effectively prevent the tendency of arrogance and complacency among some labor models. For example, labor model Zhao Fuju from Lingcangkou Village had the shortcoming of looking down on the masses, Yu Luoshan often said to him: "Labor models who are divorced from the masses are not labor models; because we not only have to do a good job in production ourselves, but also lead the peasants to do a good job in production. If we are divorced from the masses, even if we have good experience, the masses will not follow us to learn." Under his education, Zhao Fuju changed his style of looking down on the masses.

    From Yu Luoshan's experience in organizing the labor model network, the following points must be paid attention to in order to organize the labor model network well:

    First, there must be a relatively strong labor model as the leading core, which is an important link in doing a good job in the labor model network. When Jixian County's Second District began to organize the labor model network, it did not grasp this link. Initially, nine groups were organized, but two of them collapsed quickly because they did not have a leading core. Therefore, do not force the organization when there is no leading core, so as to avoid the tendency of formalism. However, the leading organs must frequently and systematically cultivate labor model backbones; make the process of organizing the labor model network a process of cultivating and educating labor models. Organizing the labor model network must be carried out on the basis of full enlightenment, deliberation, and voluntary combination of labor models. In the beginning, labor model groups can be established first, and then gradually expanded to establish a labor model network.

    Second, strengthening the leadership of the leading organs over the labor model network is the key to fully leveraging the role of the labor model network. The labor model network is an organization that leads production. It cannot be regarded as an administrative organization and given administrative tasks. The work of leading the labor model network is mainly to participate in the meetings of the labor model network, convey and implement the production policies of the Party and the People's Government, help the labor model network study and exchange production experiences, thereby understand the production situation of the peasants, solve the specific problems of the peasants in production, and promote the production movement.

### 河北冀县郁洛善发起组织的劳动模范网

    河北冀县郁洛善发起组织的劳动模范网
    河北省冀县二区西沙圪塔村劳动模范郁洛善，团结全区四十八个劳动模范组织的劳动模范网，已经证明是交流和总结生产经验、推动生产运动的最好方法，同时也是培养和提高劳动模范的最好的组织形式。
    郁洛善发起组织的劳动模范网是一九五一年一月开始组织的。一九五○年冬天，郁洛善参加河北省第一届农业劳动模范大会后，就想组织劳动模范网。他想，参加一次劳动模范会就能学到很多经验，如果劳动模范能经常联系，对交流生产经验、推动生产运动就会有更多好处。他把这些想法告诉附近村庄劳动模范刘翠苗、冀凤楼、郭秀彩等人，他们都同意这个意见。一九五一年一月，区人民政府召开了全区县、区劳动模范会议，郁洛善就把这个意见提到大会上，当场得到了到会全体劳动模范的拥护。接着，到会的四十八个劳动模范就按照各村距离远近，自由组成九个小组，各组选举了小组长，还规定了小组和组长开会的日期和地点。（小组会的作用是交流生产经验，研究各村的生产情况和问题。组长会是研究各组提出的生产经验和问题，并把一些比较成熟的经验推广到各个小组去；组长会上不能解决的问题，就提交区人民政府解决。）从此，劳动模范网就开始建立起来。经过一年的经验证明，劳动模范网有以下几个好处：
    第一、能及时了解和掌握农民群众的思想情况，鼓舞农民群众的生产积极性，帮助领导机关加强对农业生产的领导。如一九五一年这个区棉田发生蚜虫时，最初农民对蚜虫的危害普遍认识不足；郁洛善就在劳动模范组长会上强调提出除治蚜虫的重要性，并领导研究发动农民除治蚜虫的办法。这样各村的灭蚜运动就很快展开了。以后各村农民发现普治一两遍仍不容易消灭，产生了厌倦情绪，甚至有的劳动模范也丧失了除治蚜虫的信心。郁洛善又召开临时组长会再作动员，并进一步研究了除治蚜虫的办法。这样群众性的灭蚜运动就继续坚持了下来，而且规模更大了。在劳动模范网领导下的各村的治蚜运动，因为开展较早也比较彻底，结果到秋天比一般村每亩棉田多收籽棉三十斤。
    第二、能及时按照农事季节和当前生产需要，有系统有目的地交流生产经验。一九五一年春天，农民正在开展积肥运动时，郁洛善及时把西沙圪塔村农民挖水坑淤泥土当肥料的办法介绍到各村，对积肥运动起了很大作用；仅东沙圪塔、西沙圪塔、羡庄等五个村，就起运了淤泥土两千多大车。劳动模范网不但经常注意吸取和推广农民创造的生产经验，而且还经常把从领导机关和报纸上学到的经验，向农民宣传推广。如报纸上登了科学的改良厕所和柴灰人尿单存的积肥办法，劳动模范网就反复向农民进行宣传，使多数农民接受了。
    第三、劳动模范网能经常教育培养劳动模范，给领导机关指出了培养劳动模范的方向。过去领导机关除召开劳动模范会议以外，没有经常培养和教育劳动模范的有效办法。事实证明，劳动模范网是培养和教育劳动模范的最好的组织形式。这种组织形式一方面能把劳动模范组织起来，通过他们把政府的生产政策、领导意图贯彻到群众当中去；另一方面还能通过他们的会议制度，使劳动模范经常能互相检查、相互观摩，从而开展批评和自我批评，提高劳动模范的政治认识，有效地防止某些劳动模范的骄傲自大倾向。如灵藏口村劳动模范赵福聚有看不起群众的缺点，郁洛善就常对他说：“劳动模范脱离了群众就不是劳动模范了；因为咱们不光要自己闹好生产，还要领导农民闹好生产。如果咱们脱离了群众，就是有好的经验，群众也是不跟着我们学的。”赵福聚在他的教育下转变了看不起群众的作风。
    从郁洛善组织劳动模范网的经验看来，要组织好劳动模范网有以下几点必须注意：
    第一、必须有比较坚强的劳动模范作领导核心，这是作好劳动模范网工作中一个重要的环节。冀县二区在开始组织劳动模范网时，没有掌握住这一环节，最初组织了九个小组，其中有两个小组因为没有领导核心，结果很快就垮了。因此，在没有领导核心时，就不要勉强组织，以免发生形式主义的偏向。但是领导机关必须经常地有计划地培养劳动模范骨干；作到组织劳动模范网的过程，就是培养和教育劳动模范的过程。组织劳动模范网，必须经过充分启发、酝酿，在劳动模范自愿结合的基础上进行组织。开始时可先建立劳动模范小组，然后再逐步扩大建立劳动模范网。
    第二、领导机关加强对劳动模范网的领导，是充分发挥劳动模范网的作用的关键。劳动模范网是一种领导生产的组织，不能把它当成行政组织，交给行政性的任务。领导劳动模范网的工作，主要是通过参加劳动模范网的会议，传达和贯彻党和人民政府的生产政策，帮助劳动模范网研究和交流生产经验，从而了解农民的生产情况，解决农民生产中的具体问题，推动生产运动。（张纪光、李书增）（附图片）
