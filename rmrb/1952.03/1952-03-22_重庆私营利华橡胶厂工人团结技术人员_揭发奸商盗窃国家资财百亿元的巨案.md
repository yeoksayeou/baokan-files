    Chongqing Private Lihua Rubber Factory Workers Unite with Technicians
    to Expose a Huge Case of奸商 Stealing Billions in State Assets

    [Xinhua News Agency News] In the anti-embezzlement struggle, the labor union of Chongqing Private Lihua Rubber Factory was adept at relying on workers and uniting with technicians, exposing the crimes of奸商 Sun Shitao in cutting corners, inflating costs, and stealing state wealth. The criminal Sun has now admitted to stealing more than 10 billion yuan in state property.

    奸商 Sun Shitao, with a technical background, is familiar with the rubber business. For the past two years, while undertaking state orders, he has specifically researched more than a dozen ways to cut corners in order to steal a large amount of state wealth. After the "Five-Anti" movement was launched in the factory, the workers, under the leadership of the labor union, actively fought against奸商 Sun Shitao. However, in the early stages of the movement, the materials held by the workers were not sufficient. Therefore, the attitude of奸商 Sun Shitao was very stubborn, insisting that he was a law-abiding industrialist and businessman. After research, the factory labor union believed that Sun Shitao personally controlled the mixing department, and the raw materials for manufacturing products were prepared under his personal command. He must have played tricks on the technology of the ingredients. The labor union pointed out to all the workers that it was necessary to strive to unite the technical personnel to study the problem of ingredients together in order to expose the crime of the奸商 in cutting corners.

    Most of the factory's technical personnel were relatives, friends, or fellow villagers of Sun Shitao. Some had been bribed by Sun Shitao, and some had even been lured into buying shares. At the beginning of the movement, they had many concerns, mainly fearing being implicated, fearing paying back the stolen money, and fearing that the factory would close down after the capitalist was overthrown, losing their jobs and status. Therefore, their attitude towards the movement was very passive. In response to this situation, the labor union organized the workers into many groups to talk to the technical personnel separately to dispel their concerns. Old engineer Deng Chunyou had received small favors from Sun Shitao in the past, so he had more concerns. Young female workers Ling Zaizhi, Zhao Guangfu, and others repeatedly explained to him during their conversations that he had been deceived and used by the奸商 in the past, and that everyone hoped and welcomed him back to the workers' ranks this time. Deng Chunyou was very moved by these words and expressed his determination to fight against the奸商 to atone for his crimes. Technician Deng Jingyun was an old friend of奸商 Sun Shitao and had been bribed by the奸商, fearing that the workers would expose him. The workers approached him by asking him to read the newspaper, explaining to him that today everyone was uniting to fight against the奸商 and that as long as he performed meritorious service in the struggle and worked hard to reform himself, everyone would not investigate his acceptance of bribes. After the workers' enlightenment and education, he dispelled his concerns and handed over the secret specifications and cost sheets of the military supplies ordered by the奸商 Sun Shitao under his management, as powerful evidence to expose Sun Shitao's illegal behavior.

    After the technical personnel were mobilized, the labor union closely cooperated technical personnel, accounting personnel, and workers to organize a strong assault team, which was divided into production groups, accounting groups, and research groups to carry out their work separately. The production group, led by engineer Deng Chunyou, first went deep into the workshop for inspection, and gradually investigated the details of cutting corners and inflating costs according to the production process. Engineer Deng Chunyou carefully examined the rubber shoes of each period after cutting them open, and the workers also provided many clues. As a result, it was discovered that the奸商 had more than a dozen tricks in the ingredients that were not visible on the surface to cut corners. For example, for every 10,000 pairs of rubber shoes, according to government specifications, 4,200 catties of second-grade rubber should be used, but Sun Shitao only used 3,870 catties, of which 80% was mixed with the worst smoked rubber. The奸商 also used lime to replace the accelerator used when dissolving rubber, the price difference between the two being more than a thousand times. In addition, he also used soil sulfur instead of sublimed sulfur, pine smoke instead of carbon black, and crude stearic acid instead of stearic acid. These ingredients were secretly prepared by奸商 Sun Shitao, who personally controlled the mixing department, before being handed over to the workshop workers for production. At the same time,奸商 Sun Shitao secretly hid the specification costs of the government's processing orders. Therefore, the workers rarely knew in advance that the products did not meet the specifications.

    The accounting group, based on the actually investigated materials, consulted with the research group to use the method of careful accounting to collect the market prices of various raw materials in each period, and calculated the actual cost of various finished products separately. Then, comparing with the government's processing contracts, the various crimes of the奸商 in raising costs, cutting corners, and stealing state property were calculated.

    The factory's employees were very angry about the crimes of奸商 Sun Shitao in systematically cutting corners and stealing state property. All the factory's employees unanimously demanded that the People's Government punish this extremely heinous奸商 Sun Shitao. The People's Government has accepted the demands of the employees and arrested奸商 Sun Shitao.

    重庆私营利华橡胶厂工人团结技术人员
    揭发奸商盗窃国家资财百亿元的巨案
    【新华社讯】重庆私营利华橡胶厂工会在反盗窃斗争中，善于依靠工人，团结技术人员，揭露了奸商孙世泰偷工减料、浮报成本、盗窃国家财富的罪行。现孙犯已承认盗窃国家财产一百亿元以上。
    奸商孙世泰是技术人员出身，熟悉橡胶业务。两年来，他在承制国家订货时，专门研究了十几种偷工减料的方法来大量盗窃国家财富。“五反”运动在该厂展开后，工人们在工会的领导下积极起来向奸商孙世泰作斗争。但在运动初期，工人们掌握的材料还不充分，因此，奸商孙世泰的态度很顽强，硬说他是守法工商业家。该厂工会经过研究，认为孙世泰亲自掌握配料部门，制造产品的原料都由他亲自指挥配制，一定在配料的技术上玩了花样。工会便向全厂工人指出，要争取团结技术人员一齐来研究配料问题，才能揭穿奸商的偷工减料罪行。
    该厂技术人员大多和孙世泰是亲戚、朋友或同乡，有的受过孙世泰的贿赂，有的还被诱骗入股。运动开始时，他们的顾虑很多，主要是怕受连累，怕赔赃款，怕把资方搞垮后工厂关门，失去职业和地位，因此，他们对运动的态度很消极。工会针对这种情况，把工人组织成许多小组，分别找技术人员谈话，解除他们的顾虑。老工程师邓纯佑过去曾受过孙世泰的小恩小惠，因此顾虑较多。青年女工凌载志、赵光福等在和他谈话时，再三说明他过去受了奸商的欺骗利用，这回大家都希望并欢迎他回到工人队伍里来。邓纯佑听了这番话非常感动，表示要坚决向奸商斗争来立功赎罪。技术员邓景云和奸商孙世泰是老朋友，曾受过奸商的贿赂，怕工人揭发他。工人们用请他读报的方式跟他接近，向他说明今天是大家团结起来斗争奸商，只要他在斗争中立功，努力改造自己，大家是不追究他的受贿问题的。经过工人启发教育，他解除了顾虑，把奸商孙世泰交给他管的军需订货的秘密规格和成本表交出来，作为揭破孙世泰犯法行为的有力证据。
    技术人员发动起来后，工会把技术人员、会计人员和工人密切配合起来，组织了一支强有力的突击队，分成生产组、会计组、研究组，分别进行工作。生产组由工程师邓纯佑领导，首先深入车间进行检查，按生产过程逐步调查偷工减料、浮报成本的详细情形。工程师邓纯佑把每一时期的胶鞋剖开来仔细检验，工人们也提供许多线索，结果发现奸商在配料方面，要了十多种表面看不出来的偷工减料的花样。如胶鞋每万双按政府规格应用二等胶四千二百斤，孙世泰却只用三千八百七十斤，其中百分之八十是搀的最坏的烟胶。奸商又以石灰来代替溶化胶时用的促进剂，两者价格相差一千多倍。此外，还以土硫磺代升化硫磺，以松烟代黑炭，以粗脂酸代硬脂酸，这些配料都是奸商孙世泰亲自掌握配料部门秘密配制好后，才交给车间工人制作的。同时奸商孙世泰又将政府加工订货的规格成本秘藏起来，因此，产品不合规格，工人们事先很少知道。
    会计组根据实际调查的材料，会同研究组用算细账的办法，搜集每一时期各种原料的市价，分别算出各种成品的实际成本，再对照政府的加工合同，结果算出奸商抬高成本、偷工减料盗窃国家财产的各种罪行。
    该厂职工对于奸商孙世泰有计划地偷工减料，盗窃国家财产的罪行非常愤恨。全厂职工一致要求人民政府惩办这个罪大恶极的大奸商孙世泰。人民政府已接受职工的要求，将奸商孙世泰逮捕。
