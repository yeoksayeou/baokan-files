Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd. In the Northeast region, some state-owned factories and mines are carrying out anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movements in a vigorous manner, while production competitions continue as usual. Significant achievements have been made on both the "tiger hunting" and production fronts. For example, the Shenyang Smelting Plant's production of finished and semi-finished products in all workshops exceeded the national plan's targets in January. Several technical quotas broke past records. In early February, the plant's copper ore combustion agglomeration rate increased from 74% to 76%, and the actual recovery rate of the reverberatory furnace increased from 83% to 85%. The Northeast Third Machine Factory completed its January production task four days ahead of schedule. As of the 14th of February, the vast majority of its products were first-class. It is expected that by the end of the month, the original production task will be greatly exceeded. The Dalian Glass Factory's production task for this year is 61% higher than last year's, but all workshops overfulfilled their tasks in January. The plant's furnace, plate-making, and cutting/packing workshops all showed outstanding results.

According to the experience of these factories and mines, to combine the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle with good production, the following aspects must be noted: First, thorough research must be conducted and preparations must be made. The leadership must have an appropriate division of labor. At the start of the movement, the Northeast Third Machine Factory proposed: "While encircling and suppressing 'tigers,' we must guarantee production," demanding victory on both fronts. The factory's leading cadres were assigned specific responsibilities: the factory director, the general branch secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, and others were primarily responsible for leading the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle, while the deputy factory director, the head of the manufacturing section, and the workshop directors were primarily responsible for leading production. This ensured that after the movement began, the factory's production could continue as usual. In addition to assigning two sets of cadres to lead the movement and lead production, the Shenyang Smelting Plant also paid special attention to utilizing the strength of technical personnel in various sections and offices, under the principle of not hindering participation in the movement. During the movement, each section and office universally strengthened the daily inspection, summary, and reporting work.

Second, policy propaganda must be repeatedly carried out among the workers, so that they know that carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement will pave the way for increasing production and practicing economy; they should be called upon to not only actively participate in the movement, but also combine their enthusiasm for participating in the movement with production. Because the Dalian Glass Factory paid attention to this, the workers promptly found ways to plug the loopholes of waste that were identified in the movement. The plant's furnace and plate-making workshops found more than 90 ways to overcome waste within a few days.

In addition, in order to prevent production from being affected, attention should be paid to promptly handling cadres who have committed corruption errors. If cadres are dismissed or suspended from their posts for serious corruption, people should be immediately sent to take over their work; cadres who have committed minor corruption and have confessed clearly should be encouraged to redeem themselves through meritorious service. Shenyang Smelting Plant technician Xu Guijian confessed to acts of corruption and bribery. After recognizing his mistakes, the leadership encouraged him to perform meritorious service in production. As a result, Xu Guijian not only made up for the work he had delayed while participating in the movement in a very short time, but also took the initiative to solve an important technical problem. As the class consciousness of the workers and masses increases in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, as long as the leadership is good at guiding the masses' soaring revolutionary enthusiasm towards production, the increase production and practice economy movement will inevitably reach a new climax.

    一面进行反贪污斗争一面发动生产竞赛
    东北某些国营厂矿在两条战线上同时获胜
    【新华社沈阳二日电】东北区某些国营厂、矿在轰轰烈烈的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，生产竞赛照常进行，在“打虎”和生产两条战线上，都获得了显著的成绩。如沈阳冶炼厂各车间的成品和半成品生产，一月份全部超过了国家计划的指标；并有几项技术定额突破了过去的最高纪录。二月上旬，该厂铜矿石燃烧成块率由过去的百分之七十四提高到百分之七十六；真吹炉的实收率由过去的百分之八十三提高到百分之八十五。东北第三机器厂提前四天完成了一月份的生产任务；二月份到十四日止，产品绝大部分是一级品，预计到月底，原订生产任务将大大超过。大连玻璃工厂今年的生产任务比去年提高百分之六十一，但一月份各车间都超额完成任务，该厂熔炉、制板、切装等车间都出现了突出的成绩。
    根据这些厂矿的经验，要把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争和搞好生产相结合，必须注意以下几个方面：首先，要缜密研究，做好准备工作，领导方面要有适当的分工。东北第三机器厂在运动开始时，就提出：“一面围剿‘老虎’，一面保证生产”，要求在两条战线上都打胜仗。该厂领导干部都进行了分工：厂长、中共总支书记等主要负责领导反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争，副厂长，制造科长和车间主任等主要负责领导生产。这样，就保证了在运动开展后，全厂生产仍能照常进行。沈阳冶炼厂除配备了领导运动和领导生产的两套干部外，并且在不妨碍参加运动的原则下，特别注意发挥各科、室技术人员的力量，在运动开展中，各科、室普遍加强了每天的检查、总结和表报的工作。
    其次，要反复地向职工进行政策宣传，使他们知道开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动就是为增产节约开辟道路；号召他们不但要积极参加运动，并且要把参加运动的热情与生产结合起来。大连玻璃工厂由于注意了这一点，职工们及时地设法堵塞了在运动中找出的浪费漏洞。该厂熔炉、制板两车间，在数天内就找出九十多项克服浪费的办法。
    此外，为了不使生产受到影响，应注意及时处理犯有贪污错误的干部。如因贪污情节较大被撤职、停职的干部，应立即派人接替他的工作；对于贪污情节较轻、坦白清楚了的干部，应鼓励他们立功赎罪。沈阳冶炼厂技术员徐贵俭坦白了贪污、受贿的行为，认清了自己的错误后，领导方面就鼓励他在生产上立功。这样，徐贵俭在很短时间内，不但补做了他在参加运动中所耽误的工作，还主动地解决了技术上一项重要问题。由于职工群众在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中阶级觉悟日益提高，领导方面只要善于把群众高涨的革命热情引导到生产方面去，增产节约运动也必然地会达到一个新的高潮。
