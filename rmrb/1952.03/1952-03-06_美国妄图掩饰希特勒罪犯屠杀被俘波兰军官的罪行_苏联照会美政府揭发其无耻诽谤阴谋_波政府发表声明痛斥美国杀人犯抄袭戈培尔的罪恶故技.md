Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: TASS Moscow, March 3rd: The Soviet government's note to the US government.

On February 25th, the US State Department delivered to Pan Youxin, the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, a letter from Congressman Madden, chairman of the House of Representatives' so-called "Katyn" incident investigation committee (together with a resolution of the House of Representatives of September 18, 1951). In his letter, Madden expressed the hope that the Soviet government would provide "evidence" regarding the large-scale massacre of captured Polish officers by Hitlerite criminals in the Katyn Forest in 1941.

On February 29th, the Soviet Embassy delivered a note to the US State Department, which read as follows: "The Embassy hereby returns the letter from Madden, which the State Department delivered together with the House of Representatives' resolution of September 18, 1951, because it violates universally recognized norms of international relations and constitutes an insult to the Soviet Union. The Embassy draws attention to: (1) The Katyn crime case was investigated by an official committee as early as 1944, and the results proved that the Katyn crime was committed by Hitlerite criminals, details of which were published in the newspapers on January 26, 1944. (2) The US government has not raised any objection to the committee's investigation results for eight years.

"In view of the above, the Embassy deems it necessary to declare that the only purpose of raising the issue of the Katyn crime eight years after the conclusion of an investigation by an official committee is to slander the Soviet Union and rehabilitate the universally recognized Hitlerite criminals.

Enclosed is the aforementioned statement of the official committee regarding the Katyn crime."

The statement enclosed in the note is the "Statement of the Special Committee to Investigate and Verify the Circumstances of the Shooting of Captured Polish Officers in the Katyn Forest by the German Fascist Aggressors." This statement by the Special Committee was published in Soviet newspapers on January 26, 1944.

Note: The Katyn Forest Massacre was one of the heinous crimes committed against humanity by the German fascists during World War II. In 1941, the Hitlerite bandits massacred and buried a large number of captured Polish officers in the Katyn Forest area called "Kozigory," located in the western part of the Soviet Union along the Vitebsk highway, fifteen kilometers from Smolensk. In the winter of 1942-1943, the war situation had undergone a dramatic change unfavorable to Hitler's Germany, the Soviet military power had continuously increased, and the unity between the Soviet Union and its allies had become increasingly strengthened. At this time, in order to cover up their crimes and alienate the unity of the Allies, the German bandits carried out extensive slanderous propaganda, blaming the Katyn Forest Massacre on the Soviet government. In September 1943, after the liberation of Smolensk, the Soviet government established the "Special Committee to Investigate and Verify the Circumstances of the Shooting of Captured Polish Officers in the Katyn Forest by the German Fascist Aggressors" to conduct on-site investigations. Based on the bodies, documents, and material evidence of Polish officers found in the graves, and the testimonies of local residents, the Special Committee finally determined that the Katyn Forest Massacre was a bloody act committed by the German fascists. The sensational "Katyn Forest Case" was thus brought to light.

Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: TASS Warsaw: The Polish radio broadcast a statement by the Polish government on February 29th, saying that the American propaganda machine has been clamoring for months about the meetings of the so-called House of Representatives Katyn incident investigation committee. The performance of this farce and the propaganda campaign conducted for it are a link in the overall propaganda campaign of the US government to prepare for a war of aggression. The people behind this propaganda campaign are reactionary elements who have always been hostile to the Polish people and have long colluded with the Hitlerites, and the establishment of the investigation committee comes precisely when the United States is passing a one-hundred-million-dollar appropriation to engage in hostile activities in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The massacre of thousands of Polish officers and soldiers in the Katyn Forest area was committed by the Hitlerites whom the United States is releasing from prison and preparing to drive again to commit new crimes against the peoples of various countries. The Polish people know this clearly from their own experience. Goebbels attempted to use the "Katyn Forest Case" in 1943 to slander the Soviet Union, which was then crushing the Hitlerite bandits with a large army. Today, those who are slaughtering prisoners of war in large numbers in Korea and are preparing a new world war are attempting to plagiarize Goebbels' evil tricks in order to divert the attention of the peoples of various countries, so that they will not pay attention to the fact that the United States is reorganizing the Hitlerite Wehrmacht as a tool to undermine world peace. However, the American murderers who slaughter women and children in Korea cannot conceal the crimes of the Hitlerite murderers in the Katyn Forest. The Polish government and people condemn in the most resolute terms the American provocative activities against peace-loving countries.

    美国妄图掩饰希特勒罪犯屠杀被俘波兰军官的罪行
    苏联照会美政府揭发其无耻诽谤阴谋
    波政府发表声明痛斥美国杀人犯抄袭戈培尔的罪恶故技
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：苏联政府致美国政府的照会。
    美国国务院在二月二十五日以众议院所谓“卡丁”事件调查委员会主席马顿的信函一件（并附有众议院一九五一年九月十八日的决议），递交苏联驻美国大使潘友新。马顿在信中表示希望苏联政府提供关于希特勒罪犯们一九四一年在卡丁森林中大举屠杀波兰被俘军官的“证据”。
    苏联大使馆在二月二十九日以照会一件递交美国国务院，照会内容如下：“本大使馆兹特退回国务院附同众议院一九五一年九月十八日的决议交来的马顿的信函，因为它违反了举世公认的国际关系的准则，并且是对苏联的侮辱。本大使馆提请注意：（一）卡丁罪行案早在一九四四年就经一个官方委员会调查过，结果证明：卡丁罪行是希特勒罪犯们干的，详情已在一九四四年一月二十六日的报纸上发表过。（二）美国政府迄今八年以来，一直没有对委员会的调查结果提出过异议。
    “由于上述各节，本大使馆认为有必要声明，在一个官方委员会调查终了八年之后提出卡丁罪行问题的唯一目的，就是在于诽谤苏联，借使举世确认的希特勒罪犯们得以恢复原来的地位。
    兹将上述关于卡丁罪行的官方委员会的声明附上。”
    照会中所附的声明是“调查并证实德国法西斯侵略者在卡丁森林中枪杀波兰被俘军官情况的特别委员会的声明”。特别委员会的这项声明曾发表于一九四四年一月二十六日苏联各报。
    按：卡丁森林大屠杀是德国法西斯分子在第二次世界大战期间，对人类所作出的滔天罪行之一。一九四一年，希特勒匪军曾在苏联西部，在沿着威得比斯克公路距斯摩棱斯克十五公里的地方——名叫“考兹高里”的卡丁森林地区，大量屠杀并埋葬了被俘的波兰军官。一九四二——一九四三年冬天，战争形势已发生了对希特勒德国不利的剧变，苏联的军事力量已不断增长，苏联及其盟国之间的团结已日益加强。这时，德寇为了掩盖他们的罪迹和离间盟国的团结，曾大肆进行诽谤宣传，把卡丁森林的大屠杀嫁祸于苏联政府。一九四三年九月，斯摩棱斯克解放之后，苏联政府就成立了“调查并证实德国法西斯侵略者在卡丁森林中枪杀波兰被俘军官情况的特别委员会”，到现场进行调查研究。根据在坟墓中发现的波兰军官尸体、文件、物证，和当地居民的陈述，特别委员会最后确定：卡丁森林大屠杀是德国法西斯分子所干下的血腥勾当。轰动一时的“卡丁森林案”至此大白于天下。
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社华沙讯：波兰电台在二月二十九日广播波兰政府的声明说：美国的宣传机关几个月来一直就所谓众议院卡丁事件调查委员会的会议大事叫嚣。这个滑稽剧的演出和为它而进行的宣传活动，是美国政府为侵略战争进行准备的总的宣传运动的一个环节。这个宣传运动的幕后人是一贯敌视波兰人民和早和希特勒分子有勾结的反动分子，而调查委员会的成立又恰恰是在美国通过一亿美元拨款，以便在苏联和人民民主国家从事敌对活动的时候。波兰官兵数千人在卡丁森林地区被害，是美国正从监狱里释放出来并准备再度驱使他们向各国人民作出新罪行的希特勒分子干的。波兰人民从亲身感受的经验中清楚地认识了这一点。戈培尔在一九四三年曾企图利用“卡丁森林案件”来污蔑当时正以大军粉碎希特勒匪帮的苏联。今天，那些在朝鲜大批屠杀战俘、正在准备新世界战争的人们，却企图抄袭戈培尔的罪恶故技，借以转移各国人民的视线，使他们不注意美国重组希特勒国防军作为破坏世界和平的工具这一事实。但是，在朝鲜屠杀妇孺的美国杀人犯，是掩饰不了希特勒杀人犯在卡丁森林的罪行的。波兰政府和人民都以最坚决的态度斥责美国对爱好和平国家的这种挑拨活动。
