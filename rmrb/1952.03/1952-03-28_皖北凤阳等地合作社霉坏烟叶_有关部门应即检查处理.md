    Moldy Tobacco Leaves in Cooperatives in Fengyang, Northern Anhui, etc.
    Relevant Departments Should Immediately Investigate and Deal With It
    Comrade Editor: Fengyang and Dingyuan areas in northern Anhui are rich in tobacco leaves. Last year, the tobacco leaves in this area generally had a bumper harvest. In the past, the tobacco leaves in this area were purchased separately by the local product company and the cooperatives. Now, the cooperatives have decided to hand over the tobacco leaves purchased to the local product company for unified management. During the handover process, it was found that the Liufu Cooperative had 13,400 jin of moldy tobacco leaves, and another 6,700 jin had deteriorated; the Luqiao Cooperative had 5,000 jin of moldy tobacco leaves and 5,000 jin of deteriorated tobacco leaves; the Fengyang County Cooperative had 1,000 jin of deteriorated tobacco leaves. Similar situations exist in other areas. The main reason for the mold and deterioration of tobacco leaves is that the personnel responsible for collecting the tobacco are not responsible enough, deceive the leadership, and secretly mix bad tobacco leaves into good tobacco leaves for packaging. Leading cadres have serious bureaucratic work styles and do not conduct timely inspections, which has prevented the correction of this error for a long time. I suggest that the local cooperatives conduct a thorough inspection and give the personnel who have neglected their duties the punishment they deserve.

    皖北凤阳等地合作社霉坏烟叶
    有关部门应即检查处理
    编辑同志：皖北凤阳、定远地区盛产烟叶，去年这一带的烟叶普告丰收。过去，这个地区的烟叶是由土产公司和合作社分别收购的，现在合作社决定把收购的烟叶统一交由土产公司经营。在交接过程中，发现刘府合作社霉烂了一万三千四百多斤烟叶，另有六千七百多斤变质了；炉桥合作社霉烂烟叶五千斤，变质的烟叶有五千斤；凤阳县合作社变质的有一千斤。其他地区也有类似情形。烟叶霉烂变质的主要原因是负责收烟的人员责任心不强，欺骗领导，偷将坏烟叶掺在好烟叶里打包。领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，不及时进行检查，以致长期不能纠正这种错误。我建议当地合作社进行一次深入的检查，并对失职人员予以应得的处分。
