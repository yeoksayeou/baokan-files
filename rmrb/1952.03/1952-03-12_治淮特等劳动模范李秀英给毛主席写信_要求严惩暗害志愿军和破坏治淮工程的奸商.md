To the respected Chairman Mao: When I saw in the newspaper the news about the奸商 Li Yinting, Wang Kangnian, and others harming our Volunteer Army, and the奸商 Sun Yingcai and others sabotaging our great Huai River Harnessing Project, I was so angry that my eyes were about to burst into flames!

The heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in order to defend world peace, to protect the security of the motherland and our happy lives, climb mountains and lie in the snow on the Korean front, fighting the enemy. Sometimes, when food supplies are disrupted, they eat a mouthful of fried flour and a mouthful of snow, yet they continue to fight bravely. It is because of the Volunteer Army's heroic fighting that we have such a peaceful life today. Who in the world that loves peace does not love the Volunteer Army? Our entire nation regards the Volunteer Army as the most beloved people, but the shameless奸商, in order to seek exorbitant profits, have lost all conscience and harmed them, sabotaging the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.

You issued the call to fundamentally harness the Huai River in order to save the more than 50 million people along the Huai River. In order to allow the people along the Huai River to live happy lives for generations to come, tens of millions of laborers are working diligently day and night on the Huai River embankment. Who knew that the evil奸商 would cut corners and steal materials in this great construction project of the new China, seeking exorbitant profits, causing serious damage to the Huai River Harnessing Project. These evil奸商 do not want us to have a good life. They harm the Volunteer Army and sabotage the Huai River Harnessing Project. We will absolutely not allow the奸商 to commit these sinful acts. Today is the era of our people, and we must not spare these enemies of the people and traitors of the motherland. My husband, Feng Xueyong, is a third-class meritorious serviceman in the Volunteer Army, and I myself am a special-class labor model for Huai River Harnessing. Last year, when I went to Beijing to attend the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I heard you call on the people of the whole country to increase production and practice economy, and to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Yet these traitors of the motherland dare to violate your call today. I demand that the People's Government severely punish these evil奸商 and protect the interests of our people's country!

    治淮特等劳动模范李秀英给毛主席写信
    要求严惩暗害志愿军和破坏治淮工程的奸商
    敬爱的毛主席：我看到报上登载的奸商李寅廷、王康年等暗害我们的志愿军和奸商孙英才等破坏我们伟大的治淮工程的消息时，我气得眼睛里要冒出火来了！
    英雄的中国人民志愿军为了保卫世界和平，为了保卫祖国的安全和我们幸福的生活，在朝鲜前线爬山卧雪，打击敌人，有时粮食接不上，吃一口炒面就一口雪，还是继续英勇战斗。由于志愿军这样英勇的战斗，才使我们今天有这样的和平生活。全世界爱好和平的人们，谁不热爱志愿军？我们全国人民把志愿军看作最可爱的人，而无耻的奸商为了牟取暴利，却丧尽天良，暗害他们，破坏抗美援朝运动。
    您为了拯救沿淮五千多万人民，发出了根治淮河的号召。为使沿淮人民子孙万代都过幸福的生活，千万民工们在淮河堤上，日以继夜地辛勤劳动着。谁知万恶的奸商却在这新中国的伟大建设工程中偷工减料，牟取暴利，致使治淮工程遭受到严重的损失。这些万恶的奸商，他们不想叫我们过好日子，他们暗害志愿军，破坏治淮工程，对于奸商们这种罪恶行为，我们绝不容许。今天是我们人民的天下，我们决不能饶过这些人民的敌人、祖国的叛徒。我的爱人冯学永是志愿军里的三等功臣，我自己是治淮特等劳动模范。去年我到北京参加人民政协全国委员会第三次会议时，听到您在会上号召全国人民增产节约，支持中国人民志愿军。而这些祖国叛徒，今天竟敢违反您的号召。我要求人民政府严办这些万恶的奸商，保护我们人民国家的利益！治淮特等劳动模范李秀英（李佛长代笔）
