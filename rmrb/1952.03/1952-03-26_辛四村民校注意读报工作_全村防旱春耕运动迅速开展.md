    Xin Si Village People's School Pays Attention to Newspaper Reading Work; Village-Wide Drought Prevention and Spring Farming Campaign Rapidly Unfolds
    Editor: Our village's newspaper reading and learning are integrated with the work of the people's school. We use twenty minutes before the people's school classes to read the newspaper, and then through the people's school students (called "little teachers"), we convey the matters reported in the newspaper to the nineteen kang-head learning groups in the whole village. In this way, nearly three hundred farmers (accounting for a quarter of the village population) can keep abreast of national events.
    A few days ago, the newspaper published the Party Central Committee's call for rural party members to ensure the success of drought prevention and resistance work, and the Government Administration Council's instructions on drought prevention and resistance work. This news immediately spread throughout the village. Village cadres and experienced farmers formed a production drought prevention committee, which decided to universally roll all 2,800 mu of land in the village once, in order to seal the moisture in the ground. Initially, many people couldn't understand it, thinking this method was "useless," while others said, "The planting season is still far away, it might rain any day." The people's school students, in response to these thoughts, persuaded their families and neighbors. Student Dong Qi took the lead in drought prevention, deciding to temporarily stop going out to drive carts, and using his livestock to help his neighbors roll the land. As a result, he motivated all sixty-eight households in the village with livestock to stop driving carts. In order to gain time to roll the land, the village production drought prevention committee also held mass meetings by area, organizing neighboring households to exchange labor and roll the land together. Therefore, all the land in the village was rolled once in three days, and some even rolled twice.
    Recently, the village production drought prevention committee preliminarily drafted this year's production plan, ensuring the completion of sowing within ten days after the Qingming Festival. If there is no rain at that time, the whole village, men, women, old and young, will be mobilized to carry water and spot-sow. Prepare sufficient pesticides to thoroughly eliminate pests and diseases (the masses have already been mobilized to cut off and burn the lower ends of the corn stalks, because borer worms are hidden inside). Strive to increase the village's grain yield by 8% compared to last year (last year the average yield of corn was 249 jin per mu, and this year we strive to harvest 269 jin).

### 辛四村民校注意读报工作  全村防旱春耕运动迅速开展

    读报组活动
    辛四村民校注意读报工作
    全村防旱春耕运动迅速开展
    编辑同志：我村的读报学习是和民校工作结合着进行的。我们利用民校上课前二十分钟的时间进行读报，再通过民校学员（称小先生），分别向全村十九个炕头学习小组，传达报上登的事情。这样，就有近三百个农民（占全村人口的四分之一），能够及时地了解国家大事。
    前些天，报纸上登出了党中央号召农村党员保证作好防旱抗旱工作和政务院关于防旱抗旱工作的指示，这个消息，立即传遍了全村。村干部和有经验的农民组成了生产防旱委员会，委员会决定把全村二千八百亩土地普遍压一遍，以便封存地里的水分。最初有许多人想不通，认为这种方法“不顶事”，有的则说：“离种地的日子还远，保不准那天会下雨。”民校学员针对这些思想，分别向自己家里的人和邻居们进行说服教育。学员董其首先带头防旱，他决定暂时不出外赶车，用自己的牲口帮邻居们压地。结果，他带动了全村六十八户有牲口户，都不出车了。为了争取时间压地，该村生产防旱委员会又按片召开群众会，组织土地邻近户相互变工压地，因此，全村土地在三天之内都压了一遍，有的还压了两遍。
    最近，村生产防旱委员会初步订出今年的生产计划。保证在清明节后十天完成播种工作，如果当时没有雨，就动员全村男女老少挑水点种。准备足够用的杀虫药，做到彻底清除病虫害（目前已经动员群众把玉茭秆尖下端轧下烧毁，因为那里面藏有钻心虫。）争取全村粮食产量较去年增加百分之八（去年每亩地平均产玉茭二百四十九斤，今年则争取收二百六十九斤）。    北京第十区辛四村民校
