    Protest Against the Crime of American Aggressors Harboring and Colluding with Japanese Bacteriological Warfare Criminals and Using Bacteriological Weapons
    Deputy Director of the Central People's Supervisory Committee, Pan Zhenya
    The American aggressors are bogged down in the war of aggression against Korea, insisting on unreasonable demands and delaying the armistice negotiations. Recently, they have inhumanely and continuously spread large numbers of poisonous insects in the front and rear of Korea. Since February 29, they have repeatedly violated our airspace and frantically spread bacteria in various parts of Northeast China, and have indiscriminately bombed and strafed, attempting to sabotage the armistice negotiations and expand the war of aggression.

    The Japanese warlords committed this kind of heinous crime against humanity in our country long ago. The Chinese people were not only not intimidated by it, but on the contrary, shattered the Japanese fascist warlords' dream of destroying China, and cooperated with the Soviet army to annihilate all the Japanese invading troops. The Chinese people have stood up with their heads held high.

    The Japanese warlords not only committed such atrocities against China many times, but like Hitler's German army, also attempted to wage bacteriological warfare against the Soviet Union.

    Hitler established many institutions for manufacturing bacteriological weapons using living people as experimental subjects in Treblinka, Majdanek, Auschwitz, and Poznan. Because the Soviet armed forces annihilated the Hitler gang, mankind was spared the catastrophe of the bacteriological warfare that Hitler's demon was preparing to carry out.

    When the Soviet army broke through the German resistance and advanced sharply to the west, they discovered the remnants of those bacteriological institutions after they were destroyed along the way through the above-mentioned places, all of which became smoke-filled ruins.

    The Japanese imperialists also had such large-scale preparations in the "731" unit in the Pingfang Station area of Harbin and the "100" unit in Mengjiatun, Changchun, and the branches in Hailin, Linkou, Sunwu, and Hailar near the Soviet border. They also released poisonous bacteria into the reservoirs of the Sanhe District on the Soviet border in 1944. In 1945, a Japanese bacteriological team carried out bacteriological military sabotage against Mongolia. They also planned to use bacteriological weapons in the Soviet cities of Voroblov, Khabarovsk, Heihe, and Chita. Thanks to the rapid and fierce strikes of the Soviet army, which annihilated the main force of Japanese imperialism - the Kwantung Army, mankind was spared the scourge of bacteriological warfare.

    Therefore, the inhuman atrocities of the German and Japanese fascists were quickly curbed. Kwantung Army Commander-in-Chief Yamada Otozō, Medical Officer Kajioka Ryūji, Veterinary Director Takaatsu, and "731" and "100" unit bacteriological department chiefs Kawashima, branch chief Karasawa, and "100" unit bacteriological worker Hirazakura, along with twelve bacteriological war criminals, attempted to escape to Seoul, Korea, but were captured and tried by the Soviet army. Many secret documents regarding human experimentation and planned bacteriological warfare were seized.

    The Japanese warlords fled in such haste that all the above-mentioned bacteriological units destroyed their bacteriological manufacturing institutions before leaving, attempting to eliminate traces. Some were not completely destroyed, and large quantities of poisonous insects, bacteria, and rats accumulated over the years scurried around. Therefore, these criminal institutions harmed the peaceful residents of our Northeast.

    After the Japanese surrendered and were disarmed, the plague spread in the Northeast. It was most rampant in 1947. In eighteen cities and counties, a total of 30,326 people in 630 villages and settlements were infected with the plague, and 22,078 people died; in 1948, 5,947 people were infected with the plague; in 1949, 1,949 people were infected with the plague. With the enthusiastic help of the Soviet epidemic prevention team in prevention and treatment for many years, the mortality rate decreased year by year. It was not until the winter of 1949 that the remaining poison was eradicated.

    The harm caused by the Japanese bacteriological warfare in other provinces within the customs is even impossible to statistically calculate.

    These Japanese war criminals who attacked mankind with bacteria and massacred Chinese peaceful residents were finally brought to justice. The trial of twelve Japanese bacteriological war criminals held in Khabarovsk, Soviet Union, from December 25 to 30, 1949, fully demonstrated that the world's peaceful and democratic camp has sufficient power to extinguish the poisonous flames of heinous war criminals.

    According to the materials from the Khabarovsk Military Tribunal of the Soviet Union for the trial of the aforementioned captured bacteriological war criminals: During the trial of Japanese war criminals by the Tokyo International Tribunal, the Nanjing Municipal Pseudo-Local Court Prosecutor's Office submitted a report stating that there was a "Tama" unit in Nanjing (i.e., the "Rong" character unit, which was also founded by Ishii). Guangzhou also had a "Bo" character unit. This was the most secret institution in the Japanese army that often conducted vicious experiments on living people. The unit injected bacterial serum containing toxic substances into living people, and countless people were harmed by it. The International Tribunal paid close attention to this report and at that time requested the American plaintiff representing the interests of the pseudo-Kuomintang government to provide more detailed materials about the "Tama" unit. However, the American plaintiff and the Chiang Kai-shek gang not only did not comply, but even the written confessions of the two bacteriological war criminals Kawashima and Karasawa during the investigation and trial by the Soviet prosecutor (the confessions contained more detailed materials about the various activities of the "Tama" unit and the same criminal experiments conducted by Ishii in the "731" unit, and the spreading of bacteria in the Ningbo, Changde, and Jinhua areas, which were handed over to the American chief prosecutor Kennan by the Soviet prosecutor), were not handed over to the International Tribunal.

    Why didn't Kennan submit these two documents to the International Tribunal? The Soviet State Prosecutor Smirnov said in his speech on this issue when the Khabarovsk Military Tribunal opened the trial: "Probably some important figures are trying to prevent the exposure of the Japanese warlords' appalling crimes..." (Trial materials of former Japanese army personnel accused of preparing and using bacteriological weapons, page 480)

    I think: The important figure who sheltered the Japanese bacteriological war criminals is none other than the notorious MacArthur. He prevented Kennan from handing over those criminal materials to the International Tribunal.

    He not only tried to conceal the crimes of the Japanese warlords but also deliberately sheltered them, preparing to use them as accomplices in today's war of aggression against Korea.

    Therefore, on February 1, 1950, the Soviet Union suggested that the United States and the United Kingdom hand over the five major Japanese bacteriological war criminals, Emperor Hirohito, "731" unit chief Ishii Shirō, Kitano Masazō who succeeded Ishii as chief of the "731" unit, Wakamatsu Jirō, captain of the "100" unit, and Kasahara Yukio, chief of staff of the Kwantung Army, to the International Military Tribunal for trial. The American aggressors ignored it at that time because they were preparing for bacteriological warfare themselves. Their playing such conspiracies shows that they had ambitions long ago.

    Why did they repeatedly shelter the Japanese major bacteriological war criminals? It was to use their criminal experience to prepare for aggression and provoke a new war. American imperialism had long inherited the mantle of Hitler and Tōjō, expanding the facilities of the central bacteriological laboratory established in Detrick, Maryland, near Washington in 1942, and recruiting a large number of German and Japanese fascist experts to study and plan bacteriological warfare. To this end, many bacteriological research laboratories were set up in various continents. By 1950, American imperialism had spread potato beetles in the German Democratic Republic to damage the crops of the German Democratic Republic.

    After the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism re-employed the three major bacteriological war criminals who had escaped and had been sheltered by it, Ishii Shirō, Wakamatsu Jirō, and Kitano Masazō, with Ishii as the head, and established a bacteriological research institute in the mountains near Tokyo, using their criminal experience to step up the research and preparation work for bacteriological weapons.

    In the winter of 1950, when the American invading army was defeated by the Chinese and Korean People's forces and fled south, it spread smallpox bacteria. In March and April 1951, the American aggressors also used this group of escaped demons to conduct inhuman experiments on living people on the American bacteriological landing craft in Wonsan Port and Geoje Island, Korea; using thousands and hundreds of captured personnel from the Chinese and Korean People's forces to test various bacterial effects. Recently, they have even used bacteria to slaughter our most beloved Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean People's Army, and the peaceful residents of Korea and Northeast China.

    This series of atrocities shows that the American aggressors not only shelter Japanese bacteriological war criminals but also use them as accomplices in massacring mankind. It is an enemy of the Chinese and Korean people, and an enemy of the justice and security of all mankind.

    American imperialism not only violated the decision of the Far Eastern Commission on April 3, 1946, regarding the trial of Japanese war criminals, but also violated international conventions and invaded Chinese airspace. These barbaric acts are even more arrogant than cannibalistic savages; the crime of using bacteriological weapons in our country by Japanese bacteriological war criminals is even more appalling. The American aggressors do not dare to openly admit this insidious atrocity and attempt to quibble and shirk responsibility.

    The American aggressors' shameless concealment of their criminal behavior makes people even more angry. We must protest against their atrocities and conspiracies, call on peace-loving people around the world to stop and extinguish this heinous crime, and support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on protesting the American aggressors' provocations, severely punish the American murderers of mankind, and investigate those Japanese bacteriological war criminals who are accomplices.

    American aggressors, listen!

    "Today, there are millions of ordinary people defending peace and security, and there is a strong democratic force camp headed by the great Soviet Union. This is a strong force that can overcome everything, a force that can contain any provocateur of a new war and can inflict severe punishment." (Ibid., page 505)

    This was the Soviet State Prosecutor's warning to the provocateurs of a new war when he indicted those Japanese bacteriological war criminals at the Khabarovsk Military Tribunal. That group of bacteriological war criminals was solemnly and justly sentenced by the Khabarovsk Primorsky Krai Military Tribunal on December 30, 1949. The American aggressors' heinous crimes will inevitably suffer the consequences, just like them.

    I, in the capacity of a legal scholar of the People's Republic of China, warn you! Quickly stop your criminal actions. Otherwise, you will suffer the same fate as the German and Japanese fascist bandits, breaking your heads and destroying yourselves.

    抗议美国侵略者庇护和勾结日本细菌战犯、使用细菌武器的罪行
    中央人民监察委员会副主任  潘震亚
    美国侵略者在侵朝战争中陷入泥沼，坚持无理主张，拖延停战谈判。最近，竟灭绝人性地在朝鲜前后方连续不断地散布大批毒虫，自二月二十九日起，又屡次侵犯我国领空，在我国东北各地疯狂地散布细菌，并滥施轰炸扫射，企图破坏停战谈判，扩大侵略战争。
    这种灭绝人性的滔天罪行，日本军阀早在我国干过了。中国人民不但没有被它吓倒，相反地，粉碎了日本法西斯军阀灭亡中国的幻想，协同苏军把日本侵略军队全部歼灭。中国人民已经昂头挺身站立起来了。
    日本军阀不只对中国有过这样的多次暴行，它和德国希特勒军队一样，曾企图对苏联进行细菌战争。
    希特勒在特莱布林克、迈丹尼克、奥斯兹姆、波兹南地方，设立了许多以活人作实验品的制造细菌武器的机关。因苏联武装力量歼灭了希特勒匪帮，才使人类避免了希特勒恶魔准备实行细菌战争的惨祸。
    当苏军摧破德寇抵抗向西方锐进的时候，沿途经过上述各地方，曾发见那些细菌机关炸毁后的残遗痕迹，都成了烟雾迷漫的废墟。
    日本帝国主义者在我国哈尔滨平房站一带的“七三一”部队和在长春孟家屯的“一○○”部队，及邻近苏境的海林、林口、孙吴、海拉尔等地方的支部，也有这样大规模的准备。他们并曾于一九四四年在苏联边界三河区各蓄水池施放过毒菌。一九四五年有一个日本的细菌队对蒙古进行过细菌军事破坏。并计划在苏境沃罗布洛夫、伯力、海兰泡和赤塔等城市使用细菌武器。由于苏军的神速而猛烈的打击，歼灭了日本帝国主义的主要力量——关东军，才使人类免除了细菌战祸。
    因此，德、日法西斯的灭绝人性的暴行，迅速地被遏止了。关东军总司令山田乙三、医务处梶塚隆二、兽医处长隆笃和“七三一”、“一○○”部队细菌部长川岛、分部长柄泽、“一○○”部队细菌工作员平樱等十二个细菌战犯，企图逃往朝鲜汉城未及、都被苏军俘获就审。并缴获了关于以活人实验和计划细菌战争的机密文件多种。
    日本军阀这样仓猝逃命，所有上述各细菌部队临走前都将其制造细菌的机关炸毁，欲图灭迹。有些炸毁不及，多年储积的大量毒虫、毒菌、毒鼠四处窜散。因此这些罪恶机关，遗害了我们东北的和平居民。
    日寇投降缴械后，东北鼠疫蔓延。一九四七年最猖獗。十八个市、县共六百三十个村、屯的三万零三百二十六人染上鼠疫，死亡二万二千七十八人；一九四八年染上鼠疫的五千九百四十七人；一九四九年染上鼠疫的有一千九百四十九人。连年经苏联防疫队热心帮助预防和治疗，死亡率逐年大减。到一九四九年冬天才把遗毒肃清。
    关内其他各省受日本细菌战祸毒害的更是无法统计。
    这些用细菌来袭击人类、残杀中国和平居民的日本战犯终于受到了正义的审判。一九四九年十二月二十五日到三十日在苏联伯力城举行的对十二名日本细菌战犯的审判，充分说明了世界和平民主阵营是有足够力量来扑灭罪恶滔天的战犯们的毒焰的。
    据苏联伯力军事法庭审判上述被俘细菌战犯的材料载：在东京国际法庭审判日本战犯的时候，南京市伪地方法院检察处曾提出报告说：南京有一个“多摩”部队（按即“荣”字部队，也是石井创办的。广州还有一个“波”字部队），是日军中经常用活人进行凶恶实验的最秘密的机构。该部队在活人身上注射含有毒质的细菌血清，被其所害的人不可胜数。国际法庭很注意这个报告，当时要求代表伪国民党政府利益的美方控告人提供有关“多摩”部队更详细的材料。但是，美方控告人和蒋匪帮不只没有照办，就连苏方公诉人检察官侦审川岛、柄泽两个细菌战犯时该两战犯的书面供词（供词中有关于“多摩”部队的各种活动和石井在“七三一”部队内所作同样的罪恶实验，及在宁波、常德、金华一带撒播细菌的更详细材料，此项供词由苏方控告人检察官交给了美国主要控告人肯南），也没有转交国际法庭。
    肯南为什么不把这两个文件提交国际法庭呢？苏联国家公诉人斯米尔诺夫在伯力军事法庭开庭审判时，关于这个问题发表的演词说：“大概是有什么重要人物力求妨碍揭破日本军阀骇人听闻的罪行……”（前日本陆军军人因准备和使用细菌武器被控案审判材料四八○页）
    我想：这个庇护日本细菌战犯的重要人物，不是别人，就是臭名昭著的麦克阿瑟。他阻止了肯南没有把那些罪恶材料交给国际法庭。
    他不只力求掩饰日本军阀的罪恶，并蓄意庇护他们，准备利用他们作今日侵朝战争的帮凶。
    因此，苏联在一九五○年二月一日建议美、英各国把日本大细菌战犯天皇裕仁，“七三一”部队长石井四郎、曾继石井任过“七三一”部队长的北野政藏、“一○○”部队队长若松次郎和关东军参谋长笠原行雄五人，交付国际军事特别法庭审判。美国侵略者当时由于自己正在准备细菌战争，也置之不理。他们这样玩弄阴谋诡计，说明他们早就有了野心。
    他们为什么一再庇护日本大细菌战犯呢？就是想利用他们的罪恶经验，准备进行侵略，挑拨新的战争。美帝国主义早就继承了希特勒、东条的衣钵，扩充一九四二年设立在华盛顿附近狄特里克劳区的中心细菌试验室的设备，网罗了大批德、日法西斯专家，研究并计划细菌战争。为此，并在各洲分设了许多细菌研究室。到一九五○年，美帝国主义就在德意志民主共和国散布马铃薯甲虫，以损害德意志民主共和国的农作物。
    侵朝战争爆发后，美帝国主义起用漏网的和曾经为其庇护的石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏三个大细菌战犯，以石井为首脑，在东京附近山区里设立了一个细菌研究所，利用他们的罪恶经验，加紧细菌武器的研究和准备实施的工作。
    一九五○年冬季，美国侵略军被中朝人民部队击败南窜的时候，就散布过天花细菌。一九五一年三、四月间，美国侵略者并利用这批漏网的恶魔，在朝鲜元山港和巨济岛美国细菌登陆艇上，以活人进行惨无人道的实验；把成千成百的中朝人民部队被俘人员，作各种各样的细菌效能的试验。最近更利用细菌屠杀我们最可爱的中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜以及我国东北的和平居民。
    这一连串的暴行说明，美国侵略者不只庇护日本细菌战犯，并利用他们来做残杀人类的帮凶。它是中朝人民的仇敌、是全世界人类正义和安全的仇敌。
    美帝国主义不只违背了一九四六年四月三日远东委员会关于审判日本战犯的决议，并且违反了国际公约侵犯中国领空。这些野蛮行为，较之吃人生番还更蛮横；比日本细菌战犯在我国使用细菌武器的罪恶更属骇人听闻。美国侵略者对于这种鬼祟的暴行，自己也不敢公然承认，企图狡赖卸责。
    美国侵略者无耻掩饰其罪恶的行为，使人更加愤怒。我们对它的暴行和阴谋，要提出抗议，号召世界爱好和平的人们起来制止和扑灭这种滔天罪行，并拥护周恩来外交部长关于抗议美国侵略者挑衅的声明，严惩美国残杀人类的凶手，并追究那些帮凶的日本细菌战犯。
    美国侵略者听着吧！
    “今天捍卫和平安全的有千百万普通人们，有以伟大苏联为首的雄强民主势力阵营。这乃是雄强的和能于战胜一切的力量，这一力量能遏止住新战争的任何挑拨者，并能予以严厉的惩罚。”（同上材料五○五页）
    这是苏联国家公诉人在伯力军事法庭控诉上述那些日本细菌战犯的时候，对新战争挑拨者的警告。那批细菌战犯，已在一九四九年十二月三十日受到伯力滨海区军事法庭严肃的公正的判决。美国侵略者这种滔天的罪行，也将和他们一样必会自食其果。
    我以中华人民共和国法律学者的资格警告你们！赶快停止你们的罪恶行动。不然，你们就要和德、日法西斯匪徒一样，碰得头破血流，自遭毁灭。
