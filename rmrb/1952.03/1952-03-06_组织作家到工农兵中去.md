　　Organize Writers to Go Among Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
　　The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles recently organized a group of writers to go to the Korean front, factories, and rural areas to delve into actual life. It also mobilized a group of writers to go to Shanghai to participate in the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and theft of state economic intelligence. The purpose is to enable literary and art workers to temper themselves and transform their thoughts and feelings in actual struggles, as well as to experience life and create works. This is a welcome new phenomenon in literary and art circles and the first significant achievement after the rectification movement in literary and art circles.
　　In recent years, literary and artistic creation has lagged behind the rapidly developing reality. The main reason is that many literary and art workers have long been divorced from the masses and from life. This has led literary and art workers to lose the only source of creation and lack objects of labor – raw materials or semi-finished products. As a result, they either have to stop working and abandon creation, or fabricate some waste products that violate and distort reality based on fantasy. Almost all literary and art organizations have forgotten to organize creation, which is the most important task. As a result, literary and artistic creation has declined, works are scarce, and it cannot shoulder the glorious task of reflecting the great reality and thus educating the people and inspiring them to move forward.
　　This time, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles is organizing writers to delve into life, which is an important beginning to change this situation. After the literary and art rectification and the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, many literary and art workers have deeply realized that they must go deep into actual struggles for a long time, and they must closely integrate with the people to transform themselves first, and then produce excellent works to educate the people and become a "great positive force" to help transform the world. Therefore, this group of writers are determined to delve into life for a long time and will do their best to undertake work, instead of adopting the attitude of collecting materials as bystanders. This is a very correct approach. At the same time, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles organized many report meetings and symposiums before this group of writers set off, so that the writers had a clearer purpose and strengthened their confidence. This planned and prepared way of organizing writers to go down is very good. Local federations of literary and art circles should also follow the example of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, organize writers to go among workers, peasants, and soldiers in a planned way, and help them complete their creative tasks.

    组织作家到工农兵中去
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会最近组织了一批作家分别到朝鲜前线、工厂和农村深入实际生活，又动员一批作家到上海参加反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争。其目的是为了求得文艺工作者在实际斗争中锻炼自己，改造自己的思想感情，并体验生活，进行创作。这是文艺界的一种可喜的新气象，是文艺界进行整风以后的第一个显著的成果。
    近几年来，文学艺术创作是落后于迅速发展的现实的。其原因主要是许多文艺工作者长期脱离群众，脱离生活。这就使文艺工作者丧失了创作的唯一源泉，没有劳动的对象——原料或半制品，结果就只好或者停止劳动，放弃创作；或者凭着幻想制造出一些违反现实、歪曲现实的废品；而几乎所有的文艺团体都忘记了组织创作这一个最重要的工作。这样，就使文学艺术创作衰微，作品贫乏，不能担负起反映伟大现实并从而教育人民鼓舞人民前进的光荣任务。
    这次全国文联组织作家深入生活，是改变这种情况的一个重要的开端。经过文艺整风和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，许多文艺工作者都深切认识到必须长期深入实际斗争，必须和人民密切结合，才能首先改造自己，然后产生出优秀的作品，用以教育人民，成为帮助改造世界的“极大的积极力量”。因此，这一批作家都决心长期地深入生活，并将尽可能地担负工作，而不是采取旁观的搜集材料的态度，这是很正确的作法。同时，全国文联在这批作家出发前组织了许多报告会和座谈会，使作家们有了更明确的目的并加强了他们的信心。这种有计划有准备地组织作家下去的办法，是很好的。各地文联也应该仿照全国文联的办法，有计划地组织作家到工农兵中去，并帮助他们完成创作任务。
