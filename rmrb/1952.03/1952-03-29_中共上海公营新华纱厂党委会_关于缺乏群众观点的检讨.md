    Self-Criticism Regarding Lack of Mass Perspective

    To the Editor: On December 12, 1951, the People's Daily published a front-page news article on page two criticizing the shortcomings in our factory's promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. This criticism prompted us to further examine our work. After examination, we found that our main mistake was a lack of mass perspective. As pointed out in the newspaper, we did not value the enthusiasm of the masses, did not combine the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method with the central task of democratic unity, and did not appropriately arrange these two tasks. Secondly, we lacked the spirit of diligent study. We only understood some superficial aspects of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and did not recognize its importance from a political perspective. We made decisions on work steps and methods simply and hastily without investigation and research, committing the mistake of bureaucratism.

    In order to correct our mistakes, we held several Party meetings in succession, and separately convened "Little Teacher" meetings and general meetings in the fine spinning workshop. At the meetings, we criticized and examined our erroneous thinking and work style, explaining that we should bear the main responsibility for the unsuccessful promotion of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method. We decided to concentrate on and focus on doing a good job in one row first, creating experience in this row, and then promoting it to the entire workshop.

    关于缺乏群众观点的检讨
    编辑同志：一九五一年十二月十二日，人民日报二版头条新闻批评了我厂推广郝建秀工作法的缺点，这一批评推动我们进一步检查了我们的工作。经过检查，我们发现我们主要的错误是缺乏群众观点。正如报上所指出的，我们没有重视群众的热情，没有把推广郝建秀工作法与民主团结的中心工作相结合，没有适当地安排这两个工作。其次是缺乏钻研的精神。我们只了解些郝建秀工作法的皮毛，没有从政治意义上认识它的重要性。我们没有经过调查研究，就简单而草率地决定了工作步骤和方法，犯了官僚主义的毛病。
    为了纠正错误，我们接连开了几次党的会议，并分别召开小先生会议、细纱间车间大会。会上，我们批判和检讨了错误的思想和作风，说明郝建秀工作法推广不开，我们应负主要责任。我们决定集中地有重点地先搞好一个排，在这个排上创造了经验，然后再推广到全车间去。
