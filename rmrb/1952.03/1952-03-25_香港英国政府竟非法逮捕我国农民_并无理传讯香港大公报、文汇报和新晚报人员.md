Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 24th: The Hong Kong British government is illegally arresting our country's farmers working in Kowloon for cultivation, in order to carry out new provocations. Following the bloody crime committed on March 1st, when the Hong Kong British government massacred patriotic compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon who were welcoming the delegation from Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City's people's organizations to comfort the affected compatriots in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City, on March 4th, they unreasonably arrested Lin Liji and six other farmers from Chiwei Village, Second District, Bao'an County, who were going to Kowloon to cultivate land. (Chiwei Village is adjacent to Kowloon, and many of the village's farmers cultivate land within Kowloon.) They used severe torture in an attempt to force them to reveal our side's military situation and land reform situation; after Lin Liji, Lin Hongzhui, Lin Wuyin and three others were injured by torture, they were detained in the local British police station and have not been released to this day.

Prior to this, the Hong Kong British government had opened fire with machine guns in the Lianmakeng area to prevent our country's farmers from going to the fields to harvest crops, and blocked the roads to Kowloon from Luofang Village and Liantang Village, prohibiting farmers from these places from cultivating their fields in Kowloon.

After the incident of arresting our farmers occurred, the British police station declared that they would continue to arrest dozens of our country's farmers, preparing to carry out new provocations against the Chinese people.

The people of Guangdong Province are extremely angry at the provocative act of British imperialism in illegally detaining our country's farmers.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 24th: The Hong Kong British government is unreasonably persecuting personnel from Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao, Wen Wei Pao, and New Evening Post, plotting to destroy the Chinese people's news industry in Hong Kong. On the afternoon of March 20th, the Hong Kong British Police Department summoned Fei Yimin, owner and printer of Ta Kung Pao, Li Zongying, editor of Ta Kung Pao, Weng Zhaofen, owner of New Evening Post, Guo Yongwei, printer of New Evening Post, Lu Fu, editor of New Evening Post, Li Chaba, printer of Ta Kung Pao and New Evening Post, and Wen Zhiying, printer of Wen Wei Pao, to the police station and sent them to court for trial; on the afternoon of March 21st, they unreasonably summoned Yu Hongxiang, printer of Wen Wei Pao, and Li Zisong, editor. The Hong Kong British Police Department accused the three newspapers of publishing "seditious text involving the Hong Kong government, violating the Hong Kong British government's Ordinance for the Prevention of Incitement to Rebellion" on March 5th. The so-called "seditious text" by the British police is that the three newspapers truthfully reported on March 5th that the people of the motherland had lodged a stern protest against the Hong Kong British government's reactionary crime of massacring Chinese residents. The above-mentioned nine compatriots who were unreasonably accused were temporarily released "pending trial" after paying a deposit of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The case is now scheduled to continue "trial" in the Hong Kong British High Court at 10:00 a.m. on the 24th, in accordance with the so-called "Special Criminal Procedure Law".

The people of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City express great anger at the new conspiracies and activities played by the Hong Kong British government following the bloody atrocities of March 1st, and are closely watching the development of the situation.

    香港英国政府竟非法逮捕我国农民
    并无理传讯香港大公报、文汇报和新晚报人员
    【新华社广州二十四日电】香港英国政府非法拘捕前往九龙耕地工作的我国农民，以进行新的挑衅。香港英国政府，继三月一日制造屠杀我港九各界欢迎广东省、广州市各人民团体慰问九龙城东头村受灾同胞代表团的爱国同胞的血腥罪行后，又在三月四日无理逮捕前往九龙耕地工作的我宝安县第二区赤尾村农民林礼几等七人，（赤尾村与九龙毗连，该村农民许多耕地在九龙境内。）并以严刑拷问，企图逼迫他们说出我方军事情况和土地改革情况；其中林礼几、林红追、林武隐等三人被拷打受伤后，即被拘禁在当地英国警署，至今未予释放。
    在此以前，香港英国政府曾在连麻坑地区开机枪扫射，阻挠我国农民下田收割，并将我罗芳村、莲塘村等地赴九龙的通路堵塞，禁止这些地方的农民到九龙的田地上耕作。
    此次逮捕我农民事件发生后，英国警署声言，将继续逮捕我国农民数十人，准备向中国人民进行新的挑衅。
    广东省人民对英帝国主义非法拘捕我国农民的挑衅行为极为愤怒。
    【新华社广州二十四日电】香港英国政府无理迫害香港大公报、文汇报及新晚报人员，阴谋摧残中国人民在香港的新闻事业。香港英国警务处，在三月二十日下午，将大公报东主及督印人费彝民、大公报编辑李宗瀛、新晚报东主翁兆芬、新晚报督印人郭永伟、新晚报编辑卢富、大公报及新晚报承印人李察鲍、文汇报承印人温志英等七人传至警署，并送往法庭审讯；三月二十一日下午，又无理传讯文汇报督印人余鸿翔、编辑李子诵两人。香港英国警务处指控三报在三月五日刊登“有煽动性文字，涉及香港政府，触犯香港英国政府防止煽动叛乱则例”的“罪名”。英警方的所谓“煽动性文字”，就是三报三月五日据实报道了祖国人民对香港英国政府屠杀中国居民的反动罪行提出严正抗议。上述被无理控告的九位同胞，缴纳了一万元到二万元的保金后，暂获出外“候审”。此案现定二十四日上午十时，按照所谓“特种刑事诉讼法”，在香港英国高等法院继续“审讯”。
    广东省及广州市人民对香港英国政府继三月一日的血腥暴行后又耍弄的新阴谋活动，表示极大愤怒，正严密注意事态的发展。
