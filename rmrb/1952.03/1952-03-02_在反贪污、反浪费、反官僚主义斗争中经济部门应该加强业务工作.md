    In the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, our state economic departments have exposed many serious problems. This great struggle is currently continuing to develop in depth. Our state economic departments are the main target of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks over the past three years, and therefore also the main battlefield in our struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. In these departments, the class struggle is very sharp and intense. In this struggle, it is unavoidable that the daily operations of the economic departments are affected to some extent. For the long-term interests of the country and the people, we must carry this struggle through to a complete victory. However, the business operations of the economic departments must also be strengthened rapidly, and bureaucratic errors in this regard that are slow to improve cannot be tolerated.

    Economic department cadres generally understand the importance of business operations, but many people believe that the anti-corruption struggle and business operations cannot be balanced. Some leading cadres said, "I also see the importance of business operations, but my mind is full of 'tiger' shadows, and I can't spare the time and energy to consider business issues." It is indeed difficult for one person to juggle "tiger hunting" and business operations simultaneously. However, this problem can be solved by leading cadres implementing a clear division of labor. Some people focus on "tiger hunting," and others focus on business operations. If a department has three or two main responsible cadres, one main cadre should be drawn out to specialize in leading business operations. If there is only one main responsible cadre, appropriate divisions of labor should be made with the secondary leading cadres as needed, and some staff should be drawn out to specialize in business operations. After the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement enters an in-depth stage, it is entirely possible to draw out a certain amount of strength to strengthen business operations. Because after the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement enters an in-depth stage, the masses have been mobilized, the "tiger hunting" team has been formed, and "tiger hunting" experience has been gained. Therefore, as long as there is determination and methods, even if some cadres are drawn out, it is still possible to set up a battle formation and continue to complete the "tiger hunting" task.

    What should be done if the problems in some business departments are particularly serious and many main cadres have been dismissed? Should we wait "until the end of the movement before making a comprehensive adjustment of institutions and organizations"? Is it "too troublesome to transfer now and then transfer again in the future, which will affect the morale of the cadres"? These issues must be resolved. Some business departments directly related to production, such as procurement and sales departments, should promptly replenish vacancies by transferring appropriate personnel if the main cadres have been dismissed; or promote a group of activists who have been tested and reviewed in the movement to leadership positions. Some cadres, although their hands and feet are not clean, but the problem is not big, and they have thoroughly confessed their mistakes and are determined to correct them, can still be used boldly after strict education and letting them make a commitment, so that they can atone for their crimes through meritorious service in work and struggle. The supplement and adjustment of cadres should basically be resolved by the departments themselves. If some agencies have more "tigers" and the work is particularly difficult, the higher-level leading agencies should draw out appropriate manpower to supplement them.

    At present, with fewer cadres, more work, and tight schedules, departments must seize the key issues in the current national economic life. For example, the industrial sector must make the greatest efforts to ensure the supply of raw materials and the sales of finished products, and immediately start various preparatory work for capital construction; the trade sector must immediately restore and strengthen the procurement work and the work of commissioned processing and ordering; the cooperatives must fully cooperate with drought prevention and spring plowing work. In order to carry out and complete business work tasks well, it is necessary to improve the work system and work methods in a timely manner according to current possibilities and needs. The idea of ​​waiting for the entire movement to end before solving everything together is wrong.

    Some department cadres said, "It is not enough for just our part to strengthen business operations. If other departments do not do their business operations well, we will not be able to do it either." This statement is also one-sided. If your department does not strengthen business operations, it will also affect other departments. Our national economy is a whole organized by various economic departments. As long as all links actively move, and no longer wait and see, the problem can be solved. Therefore, whether it is industry, trade, finance, or other departments and units, they should all immediately strengthen business operations. Party committees at all levels must help the economic departments in their areas to seriously solve this problem.

    In the case of fewer people, more things, and urgent tasks, can business operations quickly achieve results? It should be affirmed that this is entirely possible. Through the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the ideological level of cadres and the masses has been greatly improved, and the work style has undergone significant improvements. This is the most reliable guarantee for us to move forward by leaps and bounds in the future and complete the production increase and frugality plan. The bureaucratic style of most leading cadres has been exposed and criticized to varying degrees, and they have generally made great progress in connecting with reality and the masses. When focusing on current business operations, they are now able to concentrate their efforts and seize the key issues in the work. At the same time, the past practice of paperwork, with overlapping levels, document travel, and slow efficiency, has also been changed, and simple and efficient scientific working methods have gradually grown. Moreover, many agency personnel have criticized and liquidated bourgeois ideology in this struggle, their ideological level and awareness have been significantly improved, and their sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for work have been greatly strengthened. When these staff members treat their work with a vigorous, diligent and conscientious responsible attitude, work efficiency will naturally be greatly improved. In particular, the broad masses of workers have shown an unprecedented surge in labor enthusiasm in the struggle. Many factory and mine workers have participated in the battle of "tiger hunting" while breaking quotas and creating new records. Therefore, as long as the leadership style and working methods continue to improve, the potential of the vast number of employees can certainly be brought into play to a greater extent, and everyone can do more work than in the past. Aren't these unprecedented favorable conditions for us to carry out business?

    After the victorious conclusion of the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence, all aspects of our country and people's lives will inevitably present a new atmosphere, and the national construction will advance by leaps and bounds. Therefore, we ask all comrades in the economic work departments to fully believe in our own strength and the objectively developing favorable conditions, to muster the fighting spirit to overcome all difficulties, to give full play to the greatest initiative, and with greater determination and higher confidence, immediately strengthen and improve the business operations of various departments, strive for the complete victory of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle, strive to over fulfill this year's production increase and frugality plan, and strive for greater prosperity and development of the national economy.

### 在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中经济部门应该加强业务工作

    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中经济部门应该加强业务工作
    我们的国家经济部门，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争中，暴露了许多严重的问题。这个伟大的斗争，目前正在继续深入发展。我们的国家经济部门是资产阶级三年来猖狂进攻的主要目标，因而也是我们反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的主要战场。在这些部门中，阶级斗争是十分尖锐和剧烈的。在这个斗争中，经济部门的日常业务受到一定程度的影响是难免的。为了国家人民的长远利益，我们一定要把这场斗争进行到彻底胜利。但经济部门的业务工作也必须迅速加强，不能容忍在这一方面有迟迟不进的官僚主义错误。
    经济部门的干部，一般地都懂得业务工作的重要性，但是，也有许多人却认为反贪污斗争和业务工作是不能兼顾的。有的领导干部说：“我也看到业务工作重要，可是满脑子尽是‘老虎’影子，怎么也分不出时间和精力去考虑业务问题。”一个人要同时兼顾“打虎”和业务工作，确实是有困难的。但这个问题可以由领导干部实行明确的分工来加以解决。一部分人专心“打虎”，一部分人专心于业务。如果一个部门有三个或两个主要负责干部，就应该抽出一个主要干部，专门领导业务。只有一个主要负责干部的，也应该根据情况的需要，和次要的领导干部在一起作适当的分工，并抽出一部分工作人员，专门从事业务工作。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争进入深入阶段之后，抽调一定力量，加强业务工作，是完全可能的。因为在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动进入深入阶段之后，群众已经发动起来，“打虎”的队伍已经形成，并且取得了“打虎”的经验，因此，只要有决心，有办法，即使抽出一部分干部，仍然可以摆开阵势继续完成“打虎”的任务。
    有些业务部门的问题特别严重，许多主要干部被撤职了，这该怎么办呢？是不是要等“运动结束之后，再全面进行机构和组织的调整”呢？如果“现在调动了，将来又要调动，太麻烦，会影响干部情绪”吗？这些问题必须加以解决。有些和生产直接有关的业务部门，如采购、推销等部门，如果主要干部被撤职了，就应该抽调适当的人员及时补缺；或提拔一批在运动中经过考验和审查的积极分子到领导岗位上来。有些干部虽然手脚不干净，但问题不大，而且已经彻底坦白认错，决心改正的，在对他们进行了严格的教育并让他们具结之后，仍然可以大胆使用，使他们在工作中和斗争中立功赎罪。干部的补充和调整，目前基本上应由各部门自己解决。有的机关“老虎”比较多，工作特别困难，上级领导机关应当抽调适当的人力，予以补充。
    目前在干部少，工作多，时间紧的情况下，各部门必须抓紧解决当前国家经济生活中的关键问题。比如，工业部门要尽最大努力，保证原材料的供应和成品的推销，并立即着手进行基本建设的各种准备工作；贸易部门要立即恢复和加强收购工作和委托加工及定货的工作；合作社要全力配合防旱和春耕工作。为了很好地进行并完成业务工作任务，必须及时地根据当前的可能和需要，改进工作制度和工作方法。一切都等待整个运动结束后一起解决的想法是不对的。
    有的部门的干部说：“只是我们这一部分加强业务工作，是不行的。别的部门业务工作不做好，我们也就做不起来。”这种说法也是片面的。你们这个部门不加强业务工作，同样也要影响其他部门。我们的国家经济是由各个经济部门组织起来的一个整体，只要各个环节都积极活动起来，不再等待和观望，问题就可以解决。因此，无论工业、贸易、金融等各部门、各个单位都应该一齐立即加强业务工作。各级党委，必须帮助所在地区的经济部门认真解决这个问题。
    在人少事多、任务紧迫的情况下，业务工作是不是可以很快地做出成绩来呢？应该肯定，这是完全可能的。经过伟大的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，干部和群众的思想水平大大提高了，作风有了显著的改进，这是我们今后大踏步前进，完成增产节约计划的最可靠的保证。多数领导干部的官僚主义作风，已经受到程度不同的揭发和批判，他们在联系实际、联系群众方面，一般地都有了很大的进步。在突击当前的业务工作时，他们已有可能集中力量，抓紧解决工作中的关键问题。同时，过去那种层次重叠、公文旅行、效率迟缓的文牍主义的作风，也已经有所改变，简便而有效率的科学的工作方法，已经逐步生长起来。而且，许多机关人员在这次斗争中，已经批判和清算了资产阶级思想，他们的思想水平和觉悟程度，已经显著地提高了，工作责任心和积极性已经大为加强了。当这些工作人员以朝气蓬勃、勤恳认真的负责态度来对待工作时，工作效率自然是会大大提高的。特别是广大的工人群众在斗争中表现了劳动热情的空前高涨，不少工厂矿山的工人们一面参加“打虎”的战斗，一面突破定额，创造了新纪录。因此，只要领导作风和工作方法不断有所改善，广大职工群众的潜在能力一定能够更大地发挥出来，每个人都可以比过去做更多的工作。这些难道不是我们开展业务的空前有利的条件吗？
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义和反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗窃国家资财、反对偷工减料、反对盗窃国家经济情报的伟大斗争胜利结束之后，我们的国家和人民生活的各方面，必然会呈现崭新的气象，国家建设事业必将大踏步前进。因此，我们要求一切经济工作部门的同志们，充分地相信我们自己的力量和客观上日益发展的有利条件，鼓起克服一切困难的战斗精神，发挥最大的积极性，以更大的决心和更高的信心，立即加强和改进各部门的业务工作，争取反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的彻底胜利，争取今年超额完成增产节约计划，争取全国经济更大的繁荣和发展。
