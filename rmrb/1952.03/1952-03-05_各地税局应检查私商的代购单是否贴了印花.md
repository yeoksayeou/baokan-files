Local Tax Bureaus Should Inspect Private Merchants' Purchase Orders to See If Stamps Have Been Affixed

To the Editor: Dishonest industrial and commercial households such as Dachengxing Store in Taitouying, Funing County, Hebei Province, have evaded over six million yuan in stamp taxes when purchasing peanuts on behalf of the Qinhuangdao City Cooperatives.

On February 17th, I went to Taitouying in Funing County to investigate materials related to our cooperative. I went to Dachengxing Store in Funing County, Dachengxing Store in Taitouying, Gongyi Store, and Qingcheng Store to compare their purchase orders to our cooperative with the actual purchase situation. As a result, I found that their purchase orders did not have stamps affixed. I immediately contacted the tax bureau, which confirmed that this was tax evasion and immediately notified these four law-breaking households to pay the missing taxes. It occurred to me that our city's Oil Company had also commissioned them to purchase large quantities of peanuts, estimated to be more than ten times the amount purchased by the cooperative. The stamp tax evasion alone is probably no less than tens of millions of yuan. Similar situations must be numerous throughout the country. Local tax bureaus and state-owned and public enterprises should pay attention and inspect private merchants who purchase goods on their behalf, to prevent serious losses of state assets.

    各地税局应检查私商的代购单是否贴了印花
    编辑同志：河北省抚宁县台头营大成兴货栈等不法工商户，给秦皇岛市合作社代购花生，偷漏了印花税款六百多万元。
    二月十七日，我去抚宁县台头营调查有关我社的材料。我到了抚宁县大成兴货栈、台头营大成兴货栈、公益货栈、庆成货栈，对照他们给我社开的代购通知单，是否和实际收购情况相符。结果，发现他们的代购单据都没有贴印花。当时我就去和税务局联系，税局肯定这是漏税行为，当即通知这四家违法户补缴。我连想到我市油脂公司曾让他们代购过大批花生，估计比合作社要多十几倍以上，只偷漏印花税，恐怕不下数千万元。全国各地类似情况一定很多，应提起各地税务局，国营、公营企业注意，对代购货物的私商进行检查，以免国家资财受到严重损失。  秦皇岛市合作社联合社  刘兴旺
