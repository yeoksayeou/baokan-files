"Slamming the Chair" Upon Hearing Criticism, or "Rejoicing at Criticism"?
Ji Chuyang

It is very dangerous if a person only likes to hear flattery and praise from others, is unwilling to face their own mistakes and shortcomings, and especially refuses to accept criticism. Conversely, if a person can listen to more opinions and criticisms from others, and bravely correct mistakes, then they will inevitably make continuous progress. Therefore, the ancients had the saying "rejoicing at criticism."

But how do some of us treat criticism? Here are two examples:

First, I heard that a teacher in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Yenching University, after the masses gave him some opinions, not only did not consider them, but "suddenly stood up, knocked over his chair, and angrily left the meeting."

Second, as reported in the newspaper: several teachers at Anhui University, because they were criticized by a student, "were extremely angry"; presumably because they were "extremely angry," they "appealed to the school leadership, wanting to pack up and quit." It is said that the director of a certain department in the school even called the student who criticized the teachers, not only "interrogated" him, asking him to "make a self-criticism," but also "threatened to investigate his family background and his ideological situation."

We did not attend this self-criticism meeting at the Department of Chemical Engineering at Yenching University, and we don't know what opinions the masses gave this teacher that made him "knock over his chair" and "angrily leave the meeting"; but it can be said with certainty that just by "knocking over the chair," it would be difficult for the masses to "have no opinion" of him. We also do not know the family background of the student at Anhui University who criticized the teachers, nor can we understand what relationship his family background has to criticizing the teachers, but according to reports, this student only said that some professors at Anhui University "have Anglo-American bourgeois ideas and serious individualism; therefore, there are shortcomings in the teaching content and teaching methods that are divorced from reality and cannot quickly improve teaching work." And this student's ideological situation? It is indeed nothing more than: "In order to improve our teaching work, we hope that all teachers at Anhui University can use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to wage a resolute struggle against all old ideas and old influences." But these teachers of ours "slammed the chair," "wanted to pack up and quit," and "threatened to investigate" the student's "family background and his ideological situation."

Obviously, this is not "rejoicing at criticism," but simply "slamming the chair" and "wanting to pack up and quit" when "hearing criticism"!

Students asked: Is this the attitude that a people's teacher should have? Of course not. Because these teachers have not even figured out who they are working for and how they should work. In their opinion, under our current conditions, criticism is not a weapon to bring greater benefits to the country and the people for everyone's work, so they "slam the chair" and are "extremely angry" when they hear criticism; in their opinion, their labor seems to be merely a private matter, and they can disregard labor discipline, so they "angrily leave the meeting" and "want to pack up and quit" when they are criticized.

I think these teachers should carefully study what Chairman Mao once told us. Chairman Mao said: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people, making each of us who are alive feel sad when we think of them. Do we still have any personal interests or errors or shortcomings that we cannot sacrifice?" Although Chairman Mao's words were addressed to Communist Party members, shouldn't the people who are people's teachers think about this?

### “闻过”便“摔椅子”，还是“闻过则喜”呢？

    “闻过”便“摔椅子”，还是“闻过则喜”呢？
    纪初阳
    一个人如果只喜欢听别人的恭维和赞美，不愿意正视自己的错误和缺点，特别是拒绝别人给提意见，那是很危险的事。相反，如果一个人能够多听一些别人的意见和批评，并勇于改正错误，那便必然会使自己不断地进步。所以古人有“闻过则喜”的话。
    但我们有些人是怎样对待批评的呢？这里有两个例子：
    第一个，听说燕京大学化工系有一位教师，当群众给他提了些意见之后，他不但不加考虑，反而是“蓦然站起，摔倒椅子，愤然离开会场”。
    第二个，是报上记载的：说安徽大学有几位教师，因为受到一位同学的批评，“都气得不得了”；大约因为“气得不得了”吧，便“向学校领导方面申述，要卷铺盖不干了”。说该校某系主任还把那批评教师的同学叫了去，不仅“质问”了一番，要他“检讨”，还“声言要调查他的家庭成份和他的思想情况”。
    我们没有参加燕京大学化工系这个检讨会，也不知道群众给这位教师提了些什么意见，竟使得他“摔倒椅子”并且“愤然离开会场”；但可以肯定，只凭这“摔倒椅子”，也便很难使群众对他“没有意见”了。我们也还不知道安徽大学这位批评教师的同学的家庭成份，也还不能理解他的家庭成份和批评教师到底又有什么关系，但据报载，这位同学不过说安徽大学某些教授“有英美资产阶级思想、严重的个人主义；因此，在教学内容上和教学方法上也就有脱离实际，不能很快改进教学工作的缺点”。而这位同学的思想情况呢？又确乎不外是：“为了改进我们的教学工作，希望安徽大学全体教师都能用批评和自我批评的武器向一切的旧思想、旧影响作坚决斗争。”可是我们的这些教师是“摔椅子”了，是“要卷铺盖”了，是“声言要调查”同学的“家庭成份和他的思想情况”了。
    很显然，这都不是“闻过则喜”，而只是“闻过”便“摔倒椅子”和“要卷铺盖”！
    同学们问了：这是一个人民教师所应有的态度吗？当然不是的。因为这些教师是连他们在为谁工作和应该怎样的工作都还没有弄清楚。在他们看来，在我们今天的条件下，批评不是使每个人的工作都为祖国、为人民带来更大的益处的武器，所以他们是听到批评便“摔椅子”和“气得不得了”；在他们看来，他们的劳动好像只不过是属于私人的事，可以不守什么劳动纪律，所以他们是受到批评便“愤然离开会场”和“要卷铺盖不干了”。
    我觉得这些教师应该很好地学习一下毛主席曾告诉过我们的话，毛主席说：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益或错误、缺点，不能牺牲吗？”毛主席的这一段话虽然是对共产党员说的，但是作为人民教师的人，难道不应该这样想一想吗？
