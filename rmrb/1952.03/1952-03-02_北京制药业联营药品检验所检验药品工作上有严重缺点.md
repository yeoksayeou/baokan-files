    The Beijing Pharmaceutical Industry Joint Drug Testing Institute Has Serious Shortcomings in Drug Testing Work

    To the Editor:
    The Beijing Pharmaceutical Industry Joint Drug Testing Institute is the organization responsible for testing whether drugs are qualified. Its work is directly related to the lives and health of the people. However, this organization has not fulfilled its due responsibilities. In November of last year, our department purchased a batch of calcium chloride powder from the Zhongcheng Pharmaceutical Factory; this batch of drugs had been tested by the Beijing Pharmaceutical Industry Joint Drug Testing Institute, and the institute issued a test certificate to our department. The test certificate stated: "This product is neutral and does not contain impurities such as iron and aluminum salts." However, the results of tests conducted by our department's laboratory and the Central Drug and Food Inspection Institute found the opposite to be true. The free alkali content of this batch of calcium chloride powder exceeded the limit prescribed by the pharmacopoeia, and a positive reaction was found for iron and aluminum salts. This batch of drugs clearly contained iron and aluminum salt impurities. It is evident that the test certificate issued to our department by the Beijing Pharmaceutical Industry Joint Drug Testing Institute did not conform to the facts. If this batch of calcium chloride powder containing iron and aluminum salt impurities were used for intravenous injection, it could threaten lives. The irresponsible attitude of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Industry Joint Drug Testing Institute toward the lives and health of the people should be criticized. We hope that the relevant leading authorities will investigate.

### 北京制药业联营药品检验所检验药品工作上有严重缺点

    北京制药业联营药品检验所检验药品工作上有严重缺点
    编辑同志：北京制药业联营药品检验所，是负责检验药物是否合格的机关。它的工作直接关系着人民的生命和健康。但是这个机关没有尽到应尽的责任。去年十一月间，我部向忠诚药厂购买盐化钙粉一批；这批药品曾经过北京制药业联营药品检验所化验，该所并开有化验证书给我部。化验证书中说：“本品呈中性，不含铁铝盐等杂质。”但是我部化验室和中央药物食品检验所化验结果，发现和上述情况相反。这批盐化钙粉含有的游离碱超过药典所规定的限量，并发现铁铝盐呈正反应。这批药品显然含有铁铝盐杂质。可见北京制药业联营药品检验所开给我部的化验证书是不符合事实的。这批含有铁铝盐杂质的盐化钙粉若用于静脉注射，可以威胁到生命的安全。北京制药业联营药品检验所这种对人民生命健康不负责任的态度应该受到批评。我们希望有关领导机关进行追查。
