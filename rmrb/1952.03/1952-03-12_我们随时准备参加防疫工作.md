    We are ready to participate in epidemic prevention work
    We hate the crime of the American aggressors launching bacteriological warfare. In addition to firmly supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, all our team members are willing to express our strength with practical actions. We guarantee to do a good job in "tiger-fighting" work, widely carry out epidemic prevention propaganda, and check the quality of relevant epidemic prevention drugs in pharmacies at any time. We are also determined to respond to the government's call to participate in epidemic prevention work at any time to protect the safety of the people of the motherland.
    All members of the Second Group of the Pharmaceutical Strike Team in District One, Beijing

    我们随时准备参加防疫工作
    我们万分痛恨美国侵略者发动细菌战的罪行。我们全体队员除坚决拥护周外长的声明以外，并愿以实际行动来表示我们的力量。我们保证做好“打虎”工作，并要广泛进行防疫宣传，随时检查各药房有关防疫药品的质量。我们并决心响应政府号召，随时参加防疫工作，来保卫祖国人民的安全。
    北京市一区药业突击队第二组全体队员
