Short Commentary

    The American aggressors' sinister plot to hand over our captured Volunteers to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is becoming increasingly blatant. Completely disregarding our side's repeated stern condemnations and protests, they continue to instruct Chiang bandits stationed in South Korea's puppet embassy personnel and dispatch Chiang bandit secret agents into the American prisoner-of-war camps to expand their activities, beginning to forcibly transport our captured Volunteers to Taiwan and creating conditions for continued large-scale transportation. This criminal action by the American aggressors poses a serious threat to the prospects for the Korean armistice negotiations.

    The American negotiators have tried hard to deny that they are "using propagandists of the Chiang Kai-shek Nationalist government to politically educate and intimidate prisoners of war" (Associated Press, Munsan, March 11), but the American "Time" magazine, published on January 28, openly admitted: "The prisoner-of-war camp intelligence team on Geoje Island has five Chinese Nationalists from Taiwan, and another twenty-two people (Chinese) are in charge of education classes." According to a March 14 report from the Chiang bandit gang's Central News Agency reporter, citing "reliable sources" from Geoje Island, 80 percent of the captured Volunteers have been forced to tattoo characters on their arms and write blood letters. These shameless means of persecuting prisoners of war are in complete violation of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. No matter how much the American aggressors deny it, they absolutely cannot escape the guilt of persecuting and plotting to forcibly transport our captured Volunteers to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

    The facts are very clear: The American aggressors' sinister plan to transport large numbers of our captured Volunteers to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is to force our captured Volunteers to participate in the new war of aggression that the United States is preparing. An Associated Press dispatch from Taipei on March 3 openly confessed to this sinister intention of the American aggressors and the Chiang bandit gang. This dispatch stated: "The Nationalist government has expressed its welcome to the Communist Chinese prisoners of war in Korea who volunteer to participate in the anti-communist effort." And American warmongers like Dulles and Taft have more than once openly clamored about using the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's "determination" to "overthrow the Chinese Communist regime on the mainland." In order to collect cannon fodder for expanding the war of aggression, the American aggressors do not hesitate to violate the Geneva Convention, which they themselves participated in, to detain our captured Volunteers and send them to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to achieve their shameful goals. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people and must be crushed. The American aggressors must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences caused by this lawless and criminal behavior.

    The anger of our people is unstoppable; the brutal American aggressors must immediately stop their criminal activities of persecuting and forcibly transporting our captured Volunteers, otherwise they will inevitably be severely punished by our country and the peace-loving people of the world.

### 美国侵略者必须立即停止迫害我志愿军被俘人员的罪行

    美国侵略者必须立即停止迫害我志愿军被俘人员的罪行
    美国侵略者阴谋将我志愿军被俘人员送交蒋介石匪帮的罪恶活动，是变本加厉地越来越露骨了。他们完全不顾我方谈判代表一再的严厉指责和抗议，继续指使蒋匪驻南朝鲜的伪使馆人员和派遣到美方俘虏营中的蒋匪特务分子扩大活动，开始强迫将我志愿军被俘人员往台湾运送，并且为继续大规模运送制造条件。美国侵略者的这一罪恶行动，给予朝鲜停战谈判的前途造成了一个严重的威胁。
    美国谈判代表曾极力否认他们“正利用蒋介石国民党政府的宣传家在政治上教育及恫吓战俘”（美联社汶山三月十一日电），然而一月二十八日出版的美国“时代”周刊就曾公开供认：巨济岛的“俘虏营谍报组中有五个从台湾来的中国国民党人，另外有二十二个人（中国人）掌握教育班”。而据三月十四日蒋匪帮中央通讯社记者自巨济岛“可靠方面获悉”：志愿军被俘人员有百分之八十已被强迫在臂上刺字、写血书。这种迫害被俘人员的无耻手段，是完全违反日内瓦战俘公约的规定的。美国侵略者无论怎样矢口否认，都绝对逃不脱他们迫害和阴谋强迫运送我志愿军被俘人员给蒋介石匪帮的罪责。
    事实很清楚：美国侵略者阴谋大批运送我志愿军被俘人员给蒋介石匪帮的罪恶计划，是为了强迫我志愿军被俘人员参加美国所正在准备的新的侵略战争。美联社三月三日发自台北的电讯，已公开供认了美国侵略者和蒋匪帮的这种险恶用心。这个电讯中说：“国府方面已表示欢迎在韩中共战俘志愿参加抗共”。而美国战争贩子杜勒斯和塔夫脱之流已不止一次地公开叫嚣过要利用蒋介石匪帮“推翻大陆的中共政权”的“决心”。美国侵略者为了搜集扩大侵略战争的炮灰，竟不惜破坏他们所参加的日内瓦公约，以扣留我志愿军被俘人员送交蒋介石匪帮来达到他们的可耻目的，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的，这是必须予以粉碎的。对于这种无法无天的罪恶行为所造成的一切严重后果，美国侵略者必须担承其全部的责任。
    我国人民的愤怒是不可遏止的；残暴的美国侵略者必须立即停止其迫害和强迫运送我志愿军被俘人员的罪恶活动，否则他们必然要遭受到我国和全世界爱好和平人民的严厉惩罚。
