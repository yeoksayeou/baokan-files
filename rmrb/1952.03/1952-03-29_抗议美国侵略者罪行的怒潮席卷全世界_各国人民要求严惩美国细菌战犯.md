The tide of anger against the crimes of the American aggressors is sweeping the world.
People of all countries demand severe punishment for American germ warfare criminals.
Soviet people continue to hold mass protest rallies
Expressing their determination to resolutely strike back against the atrocities of American murderers

[Report from this newspaper] A comprehensive Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Mass rallies are continuously being held in towns and villages throughout the Soviet Union to protest the use of bacteriological weapons by the United States in Korea and China. Workers, farmers, scientific and technical personnel, and literary and art workers, in their speeches, unanimously expressed deep anger at this unprecedented crime by the American aggressors. The Soviet people expressed brotherly solidarity with the heroic Korean people who are waging a sacred struggle for the honor, freedom, and independence of their motherland. More than seven thousand workers at the Red Flag Textile Factory near Moscow held a rally to protest the unprecedented atrocities of the interventionists. Deputy foreman Osipov said at the rally: "The American devils have violated all international law. The American bandits' act of throwing deadly bacteria at peaceful residents is proof of their helplessness, cowardice, and baseness." The agricultural machinery factory in the town of Lyubertsy near Moscow held a grand rally. Lathe operator Khrushchev said at the meeting: "The brutality of the American imperialists even surpasses that of the Hitler aggressors. We demand an immediate end to germ warfare and the most severe punishment for the criminals." Petrova, a young engineer at the Omsk Tire Factory, said in the name of women: "Many Korean and Chinese mothers have been deprived of their dearest people—their children—by the American beasts. We deeply sympathize with their grief. However, the murderers will not escape the judgment of the law, nor will they escape the punishment they deserve."

Everywhere, resolutions passed by the Soviet people at rallies unanimously and angrily protested the atrocities of the American aggressors and demanded an end to germ warfare and severe punishment for the organizers and perpetrators of germ warfare.

Democratic Germany's Aid Korea Committee Holds a Rally
Denounces US Imperialism as the Deadly Enemy of Human Civilization

The Aid Korea Committee of the National Council of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic and its Berlin branch held a grand mass rally in the Friedrichstadt-Palast in Berlin on the 26th to protest against the germ warfare waged by US imperialism against the heroic Korean people and the great Chinese people. Attending the meeting were Prime Minister Grotewohl, Deputy Prime Minister Nuschke, Professor Friedrich, Chairman of the Berlin Peace Committee, representatives of Chinese and other foreign diplomatic missions, as well as more than 3,000 doctors, social figures, and factory workers.

Dr. Linser, chairman of the Aid Korea Committee, delivered the opening speech, saying that all peace-loving people demand an immediate end to the American germ warfare in Korea and severe punishment for the murderers. He said: "No one can remain silent about these appalling crimes. What the United States is doing in Korea is simply an unprecedented disgrace to human civilization."

Next, Professor Eisler delivered a long speech. He listed the crimes of US imperialists in conducting germ warfare. He said: "The Korean and Chinese people are friends of the German people. Whoever attacks them and drops plague, cholera, and typhus bacteria on them, we will declare them also the deadly enemies of the German people, because they are the deadly enemies of human civilization, the deadly enemies of all progressive humanity." He concluded by saying: "We Germans, together with all civilized humanity, protest and solemnly demand of the American gentlemen: Stop your germ warfare! Get out of West Germany, get out of Europe, you spreaders of disease!" As soon as he finished speaking, thunderous applause immediately rang out in the hall, and the attendees shouted slogans angrily.

The conference then unanimously adopted a resolution protesting against the bacteriological warfare waged by the American aggressors in Korea and guaranteeing to make greater efforts to support the Korean people. After the meeting, the Chinese documentary "Resist America, Aid Korea" was shown.

Progressive Newspapers in Latin America Protest
Denounce the Shameful New Crimes of US Imperialism

Progressive newspapers in Latin America strongly protested against the use of bacteriological weapons by American aggressors in Korea and China. An editorial in the "Mexican Voice" said: The shameful new crimes of the US imperialists in waging germ warfare in Korea, as DPRK Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong recently said, are aimed at the mass extermination of the Korean people. But these heinous crimes prove the weakness of the American aggressors and once again expose before the world the absurd plan of US imperialism—attempting to exterminate millions of people to establish dominion over the world. The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" said: The Soviet representative raised the issue of demanding condemnation of the United States for using bacteriological weapons at the United Nations Disarmament Committee. This demand reflects the indignation of the people of all countries.
