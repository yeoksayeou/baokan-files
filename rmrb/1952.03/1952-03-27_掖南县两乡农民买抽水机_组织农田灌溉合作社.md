Farmers in Dawangjia Township and Yuanjia Township in Yexian County (newly established county in southern Yexian), Shandong Province, have formed four agricultural irrigation cooperatives and bought five gas-powered water pumps. This modern irrigation tool is welcomed by the broad masses of farmers and is being promoted in the rural areas of Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong.

Last September, the Laiyang Prefectural Water Conservancy Promotion Society sent people to Sunjia Village, Dawangjia Township, Yexian County, to demonstrate gas-powered water pump irrigation. Local farmers saw that a 10-horsepower water pump could irrigate more than 70 mu of land a day, costing only more than 1,100 yuan per mu. It saves labor and money, and everyone wanted to buy one. They calculated that a water pump worth more than 30 million yuan could be purchased by pooling money together. At that time, the comrades of the Water Conservancy Promotion Society helped the local people set up a preparatory committee for purchasing water pumps, and some farmers who initiated the purchase of water pumps went to connect with the broad masses of farmers to organize and raise funds for purchase. Finally, the farmers in Dawangjia Township and Yuanjia Township formed four agricultural irrigation cooperatives and bought five 10-horsepower gas-powered water pumps. After buying the water pumps, they specially selected eight young farmers to go to the Longmao Factory of the Laiyang Prefectural Industrial Company to learn about the structural principles, installation, and usage methods of the water pumps. Now, they are installing two water pumps on a small river with abundant water sources in the township and are digging wells to prepare for the installation of the other three. Farmers in six townships, including nearby Bianjia Township and Xujia Township, have also actively organized agricultural irrigation cooperatives and are preparing to purchase eight water pumps.

    掖南县两乡农民买抽水机
    组织农田灌溉合作社
    山东省掖南县（掖县南部新设县）大王家乡和原家乡农民已组成四个农田灌溉合作社，买了五部瓦斯抽水机。这种现代化的灌溉工具，为广大农民所欢迎，正在山东莱阳专区的农村中推广。
    去年九月，莱阳专署水利推进社派人到掖南县大王家乡孙家村，作瓦斯抽水机抽水浇地的表演。当地农民看到一部十匹马力的抽水机，一天能浇七十多亩地，每亩地只须花一千一百多元，既省力又省钱，大家都想买。他们计算着一部抽水机价值三千多万元，可以由大家来集钱购买。当时，水利推进社的同志便帮助当地成立了一个购买抽水机的筹备会，由一些发起买抽水机的农民，去串联广大农民，组织起来集资购买。最后，大王家乡和原家乡的农民组成了四个农田灌溉合作社，买了五部十匹马力的瓦斯抽水机。买抽水机后，他们特地选派了八个青年农民，到莱阳专署实业公司隆茂工厂去学习抽水机的构造原理和安装、使用方法。现在，他们正在该乡一条水源充足的小河上安装两部抽水机，并在挖掘水井准备安装另外的三部。附近边家乡、徐家乡等六个乡的农民，也已积极组织农田灌溉合作社，准备购买八部抽水机。（新华社）
