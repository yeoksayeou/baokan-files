Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th. This reporter reports: On the 8th, our chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, sent a memorandum to the U.S. chief liaison officer. Regarding the U.S. side's admission on March 2nd that on February 24th, four U.S. military aircraft flew over the conference area, the memorandum pointed out: Given the continuous occurrence of such overflights, our side must once again draw the U.S. side's attention and request the U.S. side to strictly restrain its air force units to prevent the recurrence of violations of the agreement.

Regarding the intrusion of U.S. aircraft into the Panmunjom conference area airspace on February 24th, our security officer immediately contacted the U.S. security officer stationed in the conference area to conduct a joint investigation. Although the U.S. security officer also witnessed four U.S. aircraft flying over the conference area airspace, he disregarded the agreement between the two sides to jointly maintain the conference area and openly refused. Therefore, the memorandum also put forward suggestions for revising the U.S. side's proposed procedures for joint investigation, and reiterated the regulations made at the liaison officer meeting between the two sides on October 28th last year, that security officers of either side shall not refuse joint investigation on any pretext.

    我联络官致美方备忘录一件
    【新华社开城八日电】本社记者报道：八日我方首席联络官张春山上校致美方首席联络官备忘录一件，对三月二日美方承认二月二十四日曾有美军用飞机四架飞越会场区上空一节，备忘录指出：鉴于这种飞越事件不断发生，我方必须再度提起美方注意，并要求美方严格约束其空军部队以防止再有违反协议事件的发生。
    由于二月二十四日美机侵入板门店会场区上空，我方安全军官即约同美方驻会场区安全军官进行共同调查，该美方安全军官虽亦目睹美机四架飞越会场区上空，竟不顾双方共同维护会场区协议，公然拒绝。因此，备忘录并对美方所提有关共同调查的程序提出了修改的建议，并重申去年十月二十八日双方联络官会议所作规定，任何一方的安全军官不得以任何藉口拒绝共同调查。
