Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth issued a statement protesting the Australian government's unreasonable refusal to allow the Chinese youth delegation to enter the country. The statement is as follows:

The Australian youth are scheduled to hold a Youth Peace and Friendship Festival in Sydney from March 15th to 23rd. The festival organizing committee sent us a letter inviting us to send a delegation to participate. We sincerely accepted this invitation and decided to send a Chinese youth delegation of 28 people, including youth workers, youth engineers, representatives of Christian youth, young singers, folk classical dancers, and musicians, to participate, and immediately negotiated for the delegation's entry visas. However, the Australian government unreasonably refused the Chinese youth delegation entry. This tyrannical act by the Australian government is clearly completely contrary to the wishes of the Australian people and youth, and intentionally obstructs the meeting of Chinese and Australian youth. We are well aware that the Australian people and youth, like the Chinese people and youth, abhor war, love peace, and very much hope that the friendship between the Chinese and Australian people can be consolidated and developed day by day. We, on behalf of all Chinese youth, angrily protest the Australian government's tyrannical refusal to issue entry visas to the Chinese youth delegation and its unreasonable measures to obstruct and undermine the Australian youth's holding of a peace festival by despicable and overbearing means. We solemnly point out that the barbaric actions of a handful of reactionary ruling cliques in Australia can never stop the growing peace movement of the Australian people and youth. We also believe that the friendship between the Chinese and Australian people and youth can never be obstructed and undermined by such despicable means by the Australian government. The people of China and Australia will further unite to fight for the defense of world and Eastern peace.

Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth sent a telegram to the Australian Youth Peace and Friendship Festival, explaining that the Chinese youth delegation could not attend the festival due to the obstruction of the Australian government. The telegram is as follows:

To the Australian Youth Peace and Friendship Festival:

Because the Australian government has not issued entry visas to the Chinese youth delegation, the representatives of our Chinese youth cannot come to participate in your festival. But you can believe that the Chinese youth are with you. The Chinese youth will pay attention to your festival with the mood of celebrating their own festival. We firmly believe that your festival will promote the further unity of Australian peace-loving youth to fight against wars of aggression, against the rearmament of Japan, and to defend world and Eastern peace.

We wish you a successful festival!

Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth

    澳政府阻挠我青年代表团参加澳青年和平与友爱联欢节
    我国民主青联向澳反动政府提出严重抗议
    致电澳大利亚青年和平与友爱联欢节庆祝他们成功
    【新华社九日讯】中华全国民主青年联合总会对澳大利亚政府无理拒绝我青年代表团入境发表声明，表示抗议，声明如下：
    澳大利亚青年订于三月十五日至二十三日在悉尼举行青年和平与友爱联欢节。联欢节筹备委员会来信邀请我们派遣代表团参加。我们热诚地接受了这个邀请，决定派遣一个包括青年工人、青年工程师、基督教青年代表以及年青的歌唱家、民族古典舞蹈家和音乐家等二十八人所组成的中国青年代表团前往参加，并即交涉代表团的入境签证。但澳大利亚政府毫无理由地拒绝了中国青年代表团入境。澳大利亚政府这种横暴的举动显然是完全违背澳大利亚人民和青年的意愿，并有意阻挠中国青年与澳大利亚青年见面。我们深知澳大利亚人民和青年，正像中国人民和青年一样，是痛恨战争、热爱和平的，是非常希望中澳两国人民之间的友谊能日益巩固和发展的。我们代表全中国青年愤怒抗议澳大利亚政府横暴拒发中国青年代表团入境签证并用卑劣专横的手段阻挠破坏澳大利亚青年举行和平联欢节的无理措施。我们严正指出：一小撮澳大利亚反动统治集团的横蛮行动，决不能阻止澳大利亚人民与青年日益壮大的和平运动。我们也相信中澳两国人民与青年之间的友谊断非澳大利亚政府这种卑鄙手段所能阻挠和破坏。中澳两国人民将更进一步团结起来，为保卫世界和东方的和平而奋斗。

    由于澳大利亚政府不发给中国青年代表团入澳签证，使我们中国青年的代表不能前来参加你们的联欢节。但是你们可以相信中国青年是和你们在一起的。中国青年将以庆祝自己的节日的心情来注意你们的联欢节。我们深信，你们的联欢节将促使澳大利亚爱好和平的青年进一步团结起来，为反对侵略战争、反对重新武装日本、保卫世界和东方和平而奋斗。
    敬祝你们的联欢节成功！
