    Mao Dun's Self-Criticism Regarding Writing the Preface for the Book "Fighting Until Tomorrow"
    Editor's Note: Recently, this newspaper received letters from four comrades, Zhang Xuedong and others, criticizing Mr. Mao Dun for writing the preface to Bai Ren's novel "Fighting Until Tomorrow." After this newspaper forwarded the letters to Mr. Mao Dun, we received his reply, which is published below:
    Comrade Editor: I have read all three letters from comrades Zhang Xuedong and others regarding "Fighting Until Tomorrow." I completely accept the opinions of the four comrades, Zhang Xuedong and others: I made a wrong introduction to "Fighting Until Tomorrow" and should make a self-criticism.
    When Comrade Bai Ren sent me the already typeset sample of "Fighting Until Tomorrow" and asked me to write a preface, I knew that the manuscript had already been reviewed by the leadership of the military unit, and I had the thought "that must mean there are no problems," so at that time my ideological attitude was fundamentally not serious and irresponsible. Moreover, Comrade Bai Ren was also urging me urgently (because the book had already been typeset), so I hastily flipped through it and wrote a preface. This preface did not point out the serious errors in the book, and the preface itself was empty and perfunctory. This is another manifestation of irresponsibility and lack of seriousness. Furthermore, when I superficially looked at this book, I was indeed misled by some of the better-written parts and overlooked the serious errors in the book. And this is inseparable from my thick petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness.
    The ideological remolding process of literary and art workers is long-term and arduous, and we must be brave in accepting lessons and brave in correcting mistakes. I accept this lesson, and I also hope that Comrade Bai Ren, after accepting this lesson, can rewrite this book completely with great courage. Because the theme of this book (the process of intellectual remolding) is meaningful and worth writing about.　Mao Dun

    茅盾关于为“战斗到明天”一书作序的检讨
    编者按：最近本报收到张学洞等四位同志来信，对茅盾先生为白刃的小说“战斗到明天”作序提出批评。本报把信转给茅盾先生后，已得到他的回信，刊载如下：
    编辑同志：张学洞等四位同志关于“战斗到明天”的三封信，都读过了。我完全接受张学洞等四位同志的意见：我对于“战斗到明天”作了错误的介绍，应该检讨。
    当白刃同志把“战斗到明天”的已经排印好的样本寄给我，并且要求我写一篇序的时候，我知道这书的原稿已经部队领导上看过，就有“那一定没有问题”的想法，所以，那时我的思想态度根本就是不严肃的，不负责的；加之，白刃同志又催得急
    （因为书已排好），于是我匆匆翻看了一遍，就写了一篇序。这篇序，没有指出书中严重的错误，序文本身亦是空空洞洞，敷衍塞责的。这又是不负责，不严肃的表现。再说，当我走马看花似地看了这书以后，我的确也为书中某些写得比较好的部分所迷惑而忽略了书中的严重的错误。而这，又与我之存在着浓厚的小资产阶级思想意识是不可分离的。
    文艺工作者的思想改造过程是长期的、艰苦的，要勇于接受教训，勇于改正；我接受这次教训，也希望白刃同志在接受了这次教训后，能以很大的勇气将这本书来一个彻底的改写。因为，这本书的主题（知识分子改造的过程）是有意义的，值得写的。　茅盾
