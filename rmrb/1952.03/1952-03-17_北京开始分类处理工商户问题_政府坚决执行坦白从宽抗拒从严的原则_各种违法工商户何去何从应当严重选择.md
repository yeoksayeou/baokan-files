Xinhua News Agency, 16th: After the State Council of the Central People's Government officially announced the "Standards and Methods for Classification and Handling of Industrial and Commercial Households by the Beijing Municipal People's Government in the 'Five-Anti' Movement," the economy drive inspection committees of various districts in Beijing have begun to classify and handle the problems of industrial and commercial households according to the provisions of this document.

In the past half month, the issue of classifying and handling industrial and commercial households has been fully discussed and prepared among industrial and commercial circles and workers and shop assistants. When the "Investigation and Handling Form for Illegal Facts of Industrial and Commercial Households" was issued, each district held industrial and commercial household conferences starting from the 13th of this month, explained the policies in detail, provided education, and called on all industrial and commercial households in the city to fill in the forms truthfully and confess thoroughly in order to strive for lenient treatment from the People's Government. After the forms were issued, they were generally filled out within three days and are now being reviewed according to the following procedure: 1. Industrial and commercial household study group; 2. Accountant (or bookkeeper) of the factory or store; 3. All workers and shop assistants of the factory or store; 4. Labor union office of the district; 5. Economy drive inspection committee of the district. (This agency mistakenly reported on the 14th that industrial and commercial households had only half a day to one day to complete the forms, and accountants had only half a day to review them.)

After three days, the three categories of industrial and commercial households—law-abiding households, basically law-abiding households, and half-law-abiding and half-law-breaking households—have generally completed the "Illegal Investigation and Handling Forms." During the filling-in process, many industrial and commercial households supplemented their confessions of illegal activities, and some also reported others. For example, Baoji Tannery in the Ninth District confessed to evading taxes and underreporting a turnover of more than 900 million yuan and stealing state property worth more than 100 million yuan. They also reported the crimes of 15 other households in the same industry, whose illegal profits totaled 1.4 billion yuan. Therefore, at the industrial and commercial household conference held in the Ninth District on the 15th of this month, the government announced that they would be treated leniently and exempted from fines and criminal punishment. Some illegal capitalists, whose own crimes were serious, refused to confess and resisted the movement. For example, Kang Jiazhen, manager of a construction factory in the Third District, used bribery and other vicious means to collude with staff members of state organs for three years. He massively embezzled and swindled state property in contracting for certain military projects. According to preliminary statistics, his embezzlement and fraud reached 2.662 billion yuan. In the "Five-Anti" movement, he not only refused to confess thoroughly but also tried every possible means to quibble and sabotage the movement. Therefore, at the industrial and commercial household conference held in the Third District on the 15th of this month, the public security organs arrested him on the spot. These two different treatments clearly pointed out two paths to industrial and commercial households: "Lenient treatment for confession and severe punishment for resistance." The choice of which path to take is entirely up to the various illegal industrialists and businessmen.

    北京开始分类处理工商户问题
    政府坚决执行坦白从宽抗拒从严的原则
    各种违法工商户何去何从应当严重选择
    【新华社十六日讯】中央人民政府政务院明令公布“北京市人民政府在‘五反’运动中关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法”后，北京市各区节约检查委员会根据这一文件的规定，已开始分类处理工商户问题。
    在过去半月中，关于分类处理工商户问题已在工商界和工人店员中进行了充分酝酿和其他准备工作。此次发下“工商户违法事实调查处理表”时，各区都自本月十三日起召开了工商户大会，又详细交代了政策，给以教育，号召全市工商户据实填写，彻底坦白，以便争取人民政府的宽大处理。表格发下后，一般已在三天之内填写完毕，现正按照下列程序进行审查：一、工商户学习组；二、本厂本店的会计（或司账）；三、本厂本店全体工人店员；四、本区工会办事处；五、本区节约检查委员会。（十四日本社误报工商户限期半天到一天内填完表格，会计在半天内将表格审查完毕。）
    经过三天的时间，各区守法户、基本守法户、半守法半违法户这三类工商户大体上都已把“违法调查处理表”填写完毕。在填表过程中，不少工商户都补充交代了自己的违法行为，有些并检举了别人。如九区保记制革厂坦白了偷税漏报流水九亿多元、盗窃国家资财一亿多元以后，并检举了同业十五户违法利得共达十四亿元的罪行，因而在本月十五日第九区召开的工商户大会上，政府宣布对他从宽处理，免予罚款和刑事处分。有些违法资本家本身罪行严重，却又坚不坦白，抗拒运动，如三区营造厂经理康家珍，三年来用行贿等恶毒手段勾结国家机关工作人员，在承包某些军事工程中大量盗骗国家资财，据初步统计，其盗骗所得已达二十亿六千余万元，在“五反”运动中不但不彻底坦白，反而百般狡赖，破坏运动，因而在本月十五日第三区召开的工商户大会上，由公安机关当场予以逮捕。两种不同的处理，给工商户鲜明地指出了两条道路，即“坦白从宽，抗拒从严”，何去何从，完全由各种违法工商业者自择。
