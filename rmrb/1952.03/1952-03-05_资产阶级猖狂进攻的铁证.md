Ironclad Proof of the Bourgeoisie's Rampant Attacks
Qi Long

(I) Is it the bourgeoisie launching a rampant attack or the People's Government adopting a "leveling" policy?

At the end of last year, Chairman Mao called on the people of the whole country and all staff to vigorously and swiftly launch a large-scale anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to cleanse the filth left over from the old society.

The people of the whole country responded to Chairman Mao's call and first launched the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement within the Chinese Communist Party, within the People's Government, within the People's Liberation Army, and within people's organizations. Subsequently, a struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence was launched in the industrial and commercial sectors.

The anti-corruption struggle and the anti-theft struggle, in essence, are both to repel the rampant attacks launched by the bourgeoisie against the working class and the Chinese people's revolutionary cause led by it. In the past three years, the bourgeoisie, in its rampant attacks, has embezzled a large amount of state wealth into private hands in the economic field, squandering it at will, thereby endangering the great cause of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and national construction; in the political field, it has usurped some state organs entirely or partially, and corrupted and ensnared many revolutionary cadres. Therefore, we must suppress this reactionary attack by the bourgeoisie in order to consolidate the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and pave the way for our motherland to move towards socialism.

However, even today, some bourgeois elements are fabricating various rumors, trying their best to defend the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie. Some say: "Industrial and commercial operators in Northeast China have long had no business to do. Now there is another anti-theft campaign. In the future, we would rather throw things away than sell them to staff, to avoid being accused of bribery." Some say: "The government always says we are treacherous merchants. Only when the merchants' heads are leveled can you say we are not treacherous merchants." Obviously, these are completely unrealistic and very malicious slanders.

In fact, the private industrial and commercial sectors in Northeast China are not undeveloped, but are developing rapidly. Looking at industrial production, although the state-owned industry in Northeast China is very large in scale, the total value of private industrial production is still increasing rapidly year after year. The growth rate, taking 1949 as 100, was 132 in 1950 and 182.4 in 1951. The development of private commerce is even faster. At the end of 1951, the total retail sales in the Northeast market still accounted for about one-half of private commerce. In Shenyang, the number of private commercial households was 15,496 in January 1951, increasing to 16,900 in June; its turnover, taking January as 100, reached 131.4 in June and 189.3 in September. Facts prove that industrial and commercial operators in Northeast China have never been as prosperous in recent years as they were before the "September 18th Incident," during the Japanese occupation, or during the Kuomintang rule. It is precisely because the bourgeoisie has a certain position in politics and is increasingly developing economically that in recent years, while acknowledging the leadership of the Chinese working class, they have been trying their best to expand their ideological influence in all aspects and adopting various methods and forms to compete with the working class for leadership in politics and economics. They attempt to drag our country away from the path of New Democracy—Socialism; and allow capitalism to run rampant freely, developing according to the capitalist path. They painstakingly and meticulously corrupt state personnel, penetrate state power and economic organizations, attempting to separate the people's democratic dictatorship from the leadership of the proletariat and let the bourgeoisie monopolize the fruits of the people's victory. Is this them launching a rampant attack, or is the People's Government trying to "level" their "heads"? The following facts (which are just a small part of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks) will answer this question.

(II) A comprehensive attack from the economic to the political

According to the materials currently available from various parts of Northeast China, the bourgeoisie's attacks are all-pervasive. They extend their extremely foul suction tubes into the Chinese Communist Party, into the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army, and also into people's organizations, especially into state economic organs and state-owned enterprises, in order to achieve their vicious purpose of corrupting the revolutionary ranks and encroaching on the fruits of the people's victory. Through a large amount of bribery, tax evasion, shoddy workmanship, theft of state property, and theft of state economic intelligence, they have caused the state to lose a large amount of wealth, causing significant and irreparable damage to our national defense construction and economic construction.

The bourgeoisie launched a particularly fierce attack on the economic front, firstly because this is a relatively concealed struggle, which is generally not easily detected; secondly, because the state-owned economy is the material foundation of the new democratic society, and damage to this foundation will directly affect the future of our country. Therefore, the ultimate result of this attack by the bourgeoisie will not only be economic losses to the country, but also directly harm the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, affecting the future of national economic development. This is an attack on the lives of millions of people, a rampant offensive from the economic to the political.

Weakening the State-Owned Economy

One way the bourgeoisie attacks state economic organs and state-owned enterprises is by adopting various methods to weaken the strength of the state-owned economy. This is a common and widespread situation today.

One method used by the bourgeoisie to weaken the state-owned economy is to adopt various methods of theft to cause losses to state-owned enterprises. For example, the country's steel production is currently still very insufficient, but a group of treacherous merchants in Tianjin bribed the deputy director of a steel plant in Northeast China and other cadres, stealing 700 tons of steel, half of which were special steel materials. The country's production of telecommunications equipment is insufficient, and many materials are imported from abroad, but Wang Zhanheng, a treacherous merchant in Shenyang, colluded with the director of the warehouse of the Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Administration, stealing a large number of valuable equipment. In order to meet the needs of the increasingly developing economic construction, the country is vigorously developing the coal mining industry, but Liu Wentao, a treacherous merchant from the Huaxing Scientific Instrument Company, stole several life-saving devices and several resuscitators and other valuable instruments, worth a total of 1.5 billion yuan.

Another method is to cut corners in processing orders, causing losses in production and supply. For example, Wang Zheng, a treacherous merchant, infiltrated the Fushun Chemical Plant, usurped the position of factory director, and colluded with other treacherous merchants to contract for the plant's projects. Due to the poor quality of the projects, the lifespan of one project was shortened by eight years of use; another project caused the plant to shut down for two months due to just one accident; including other losses, the total value was enough for all the workers of the plant to eat and use for eleven years. For example, the three private shoe factories in Harbin, Jian Da, Zhong Da, and Feng Da, cut corners in processing cotton shoes for department stores, resulting in a large number of shoes that did not meet the specifications. The masses were extremely dissatisfied with the department stores, and the Songjiang Provincial Department Store had to order all sales to be stopped, seriously affecting the country's supply work.

Another method is to infiltrate the state-owned enterprises and cooperative economic system, and use their powers to intentionally accumulate state-owned enterprise products and expand the sales of private merchants' products. For example, Qi Changgeng and other treacherous merchants infiltrated cooperative warehouses, embezzled 1.5 billion yuan of cooperative funds (only preliminary investigation materials have been found) for speculation and established factories. They also used the cooperative system to dump their inferior products in large quantities, causing severe losses to cooperatives in various places due to slow sales of inferior goods and accumulation of funds. For example, Dai Mingzhe, an employee of Shenyang Department Store, colluded with treacherous merchants, filled the stationery department counter of the department store with ink produced by private enterprises, while only one bottle of products from state-owned factories was displayed, causing state-owned products to be accumulated for more than two years.

Controlling State-Owned Enterprises

Another way the bourgeoisie attacks state economic organs and state-owned enterprises is to use inside-outside coordination to control and usurp certain state-owned enterprises or part of the organization of such enterprises, causing them to deteriorate. Luo Huichun, the manager of the Northeast China Company of the China Medical Company, was defeated by "sugar-coated bullets" and surrendered his position, which is a clear example. Before the Luo Huichun case was exposed, a large number of bourgeois agents infiltrated the Northeast China Company of the China Medical Company, resulting in 31 employees of the company who were from merchant backgrounds or are still merchants, and five cadres who were dragged into the water; among the nine section chiefs, four were from merchant backgrounds and two were "planted spies." In this way, the medical company was attacked all over and completely lost the nature of a state-owned enterprise. For example, in 1950, after the treacherous merchant Han Yimin sold his Yongfayuan agency to Shenyang Trust Company, he formed the Second Goods Station and led his entire team into the trust company. Han Yimin stole the position of the leader of the miscellaneous goods group of the business section and colluded with other private merchants, using the Second Goods Station as a base to expand the scale of his attack.

A Comprehensive Attack on the Party, Government, Army, and People

As mentioned earlier, the attacks of the bourgeoisie are all-pervasive. They not only viciously harmed our state-owned economy, but also carried out rampant infiltration and erosion into all aspects of the Chinese Communist Party organization, the People's Government organs, the People's Liberation Army, trade union organizations, and scientific and cultural groups.

The Jiahe County Committee incident best illustrates the bourgeoisie's attack on the Chinese Communist Party organization: Liang Qifa, a rogue merchant who sold drugs in Jilin Province, used all kinds of rogue methods to attack Yin Zihua, the then District Chief of Jiahe Chengguan District, and Cui Xiaoguang, an assistant to the district government, from 1946, dragging them into the water to jointly sell drugs for profit. After 1949, Yin Zihua served as the Secretary of the Jiahe County Committee and County Head, and Cui Xiaoguang served as the Secretary of the County Committee of the Communist Youth League. Their various criminal activities became even more rampant. Liang Qifa made a profit of more than 1 billion yuan in the business of reselling wood alone. The Jiahe County Committee of the Communist Party of China, headed by the degenerate element Yin Zihua, including the Director of the Public Security Bureau Ren Guocai, the Director of the Taxation Bureau He Wen, and the Minister of the Organization Department of the County Committee Meng Yashu, became a corrupt group. The entire Party Committee organization was corrupted and deteriorated by the bourgeoisie.

There are also many crimes committed by the bourgeoisie against the People's Government: Zhou Longchuan, a treacherous merchant from the Furen Joint Timber Factory in Qiqihar, pretended to be progressive after liberation and stole the position of member of the Municipal People's Government. Then, like infectious germs in the People's Government, he eroded various departments. The cadres he corrupted included Zhao Shuxue from the Inner Mongolia Construction Committee, as well as many cadres from the Qiqihar Construction Bureau, Heilongjiang Provincial Department Store, Qiqihar Grain Company, Railway Bureau Goods Office, and the Qiqihar Third District Cooperative. For example, the private iron factory "Eight Great Families" in Anshan City usurped the leadership of the Municipal Government's Production Enterprise Section, monopolized processing orders, and raised market prices, squeezing out small and medium-sized iron factories, making the Municipal Government's Production Enterprise Section a tool only for serving the "Eight Great Families" bourgeoisie. For example, Zhou Huanan, Deputy Director of the Jilin Provincial Finance Department, became a prisoner of the bourgeoisie, using a large amount of public funds to allow the treacherous merchant Zhang Wenyi to engage in speculation and appointed the economic traitor Yan as the Director of the Tianjin Sales Office of the Jilin Provincial Finance Department and recruited some people with unclear political backgrounds to work in government agencies... This proves how rampantly the illegal elements of the bourgeoisie constantly launched vicious dark arrows towards the People's Government.

The illegal elements of the bourgeoisie also harmed the cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and damaged the lofty reputation of the People's Liberation Army among the people with malicious intentions in various ways: The treacherous merchant Yao Tingshun purchased a large number of diseased pigs and sold them to the troops; the Qidong Electric Power Industry Cooperative contracted for a project for a certain unit, bribing a section chief with twelve gold ingots, stealing construction materials worth more than 7 billion Northeast currency; Wei Taihe, a treacherous merchant from the Gongyou Watch Store in Harbin, impersonated a military officer and privately forged seals, including "Liberation Army Tank Force Squads 26 and 28" and "First Column of the Chinese People's Public Security Force" and six or seven other types in order to achieve his purpose of trafficking private goods and engaging in speculation.

The bourgeoisie took advantage of the weak and powerless trade union organizations in private enterprises to launch a large-scale attack. After the manager of the Fushun Yihe Paper Mill induced the chairman of the trade union, Dong Baotai, to fall into the quagmire of corruption, he openly coerced him, saying, "You have a handle in my hand, follow me by the nose." The capitalists of the Longtai Weaving Factory usurped the leadership of the trade union, and the manager became the chairman of the trade union, and then launched a rampant attack on the workers: apprentices worked 18 hours a day, and their monthly salary was only 25,000 yuan. When the workers raised objections, the capitalists put a hat on them: "Dare you not love the country? To love the country, you must complete the country's processing tasks!" What a magnificent slogan! Many capitalists are destroying the trade union organization in every possible way and are using the love of the motherland and the active production emotions of the majority of employees to engage in all kinds of exploitation, embezzlement, and self-interest to satisfy their desire to harm others for personal gain and seek only profit.

Here is another example - just one of countless incidents, please see how the bourgeoisie is attacking scientific and cultural undertakings. There is a Natural Science Instrument Museum (private merchant) in Shenyang. The manager's name is Zhang Ming. Among his countless crimes are the following three: First, he numbered the addresses and responsible persons of 130 factories, mines, and scientific research institutes across the country, preparing to infiltrate them in a planned way. One is to steal the materials catalogs of the instruments purchased by certain factories, mines, and cultural and educational institutions, and send spies to steal them from state organs or traffic them from other places, and then sell them to the state at high prices. The other is that he formulated a "ten-year plan," starting from November 1950, preparing to expand his "career" by various illegal means within ten years, establishing eight departments, three factories, and more than ten offices, attempting to control all or most of China's scientific instrument import and manufacturing work.

Of course, the most intolerable thing is the bourgeoisie's attack on our most beloved people - the Chinese People's Volunteers. In addition to the serious illegal acts that have been exposed in Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and other places, such as using bad beef to make canned food, using bacterial cotton to make first-aid kits, and stealing and deceiving huge amounts of medical expenses from the Volunteers, many similar cases have also been found in various parts of Northeast China. For example, the treacherous merchant Yang Wenyun contracted to make anti-skid chains for automobiles, replacing good materials with waste materials and filling qualified products with waste products, resulting in a large number of anti-skid chains that could not be used when transported to the front, seriously damaging military transportation. The treacherous merchant Wang Renfa made bridge panels with rotten wood, which were often crushed by heavy trucks, affecting transportation. The treacherous merchant Li Yanshuang stole auto parts from the Volunteers, seriously endangering military transportation on the front line. For example, the nineteen grain and rice processing industries in Shenyang City, such as Hongtai and Gongda, colluded to reduce the rice yield when processing grain and rice for the Volunteers, and collectively mixed chaff and sand into the processed rice. They stole the Volunteers' rations and fattened their own bellies. Some treacherous merchants, such as Zhang Mingzhong, made fake medicines and sent them to the Volunteers, and some mixed into the hospital and replaced real medicines with fake medicines, firing at the lives of the wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteers. Actions such as the above are by no means isolated phenomena. Isn't the attack of these people on the people's revolutionary cause already extreme? Do they still have a bit of Chinese flavor? Therefore, after these news were announced, they immediately aroused the resentment of the masses from all walks of life, demanding that the government severely punish these treacherous merchants. The people's indignation is completely just and completely understandable. May I ask the gentlemen of the bourgeoisie: Isn't it precisely because of the arduous battles of the Volunteers that they have protected the safety of the motherland and repelled the attack of U.S. imperialism on our motherland? Isn't it precisely because of the victorious battles of the Volunteers that they have protected the lives and property of the people across the country, including your own? The Volunteers are fighting one after another in the icy and snowy weather, while you are taking advantage of the peaceful environment in the rear to speculate and make a fortune is not enough, but instead repay kindness with revenge, releasing vicious cold arrows from behind to harm them. What are your intentions? Is there a bit of humanity in this? Is there any attack that is more rampant, more vicious, and more despicable and shameless than this?

The above is just a small part of the millions of crimes committed by the bourgeoisie. Based on these materials, we can completely draw the conclusion that the attack of the bourgeoisie is a rampant and comprehensive attack, which is beyond doubt.

(III) The Tactics of the Bourgeoisie's Attacks

In his report at the meeting of senior cadres of the Northeast Bureau on January 10, Comrade Gao Gang pointed out: "The bourgeoisie's erosion of the Party is multifaceted. Its main methods are two: pulling over and sending in."

The so-called "pulling over" means that the bourgeoisie viciously uses all kinds of despicable and shameless methods to seduce and frame the staff of state organs and enterprises, making them step by step fall into the quagmire of corruption and degeneration, becoming agents of the bourgeoisie placed in state organs, state-owned enterprises, and cooperative undertakings.

The so-called "sending in" means that the bourgeoisie uses various disguises to deceive certain bureaucratic leaders of our organization, or through the relationship of elements who collude with them, to send their children, relatives, or confidants into state organs, state-owned enterprises, or cooperatives; or under various covers and pretexts, to transform their own shops, nominally turning them into state shops or cooperatives, while engaging in speculative activities and stealing state property. The purpose of their "sending in," as Comrade Gao Gang pointed out, is: "They come in not to serve state shops and cooperatives, but to serve capitalists. Some local state shops and cooperatives are usurped by them to change goods, steal business information, hoard and speculate, disrupt the market, and use state enterprise institutions as tools for capitalists to steal public funds for private gain and seek speculative profits."

"Pulling over" and "sending in," although different in method, have only one purpose, which is to: corrupt certain staff and local organizations in state organs and enterprises, usurp the leadership of the working class, and carry out large-scale theft activities.

"Magic Weapon" for Entry

The method used by illegal capitalists to "pull over" state personnel is varied. Generally speaking, the first step is to use making friends, inviting guests and giving gifts, openly bribing, and using the "beauty trap" to lure you to take the bait.

Before listing these facts, let us first quote the confession of Bi Keming, a treacherous merchant in Changchun, to see how the illegal elements of the bourgeoisie painstakingly tempted our cadres. Bi Keming wrote: "In order to get money, I used the bad methods of the old society to seduce and lure cadres in every possible way, talking about 'long-term investment for big returns.' When buying goods from the Coal Industry Construction Company, I would carry high-quality cigarettes in my waist and give them to everyone I met in order to leave a 'good' impression in everyone's eyes. I would then 'chat' and 'probe their feelings,' such as asking: 'How many points do you earn?' 'How many people are there in your family?' Seeing that the other party was interested, I would tempt them: 'You are really suffering!' 'I am the best at making friends. Just tell me if you need money, no matter how much!' Sometimes I would even try to establish a kinship relationship. Some people were gradually won over by me."

Now, let's take a look at the main tricks used by the bourgeoisie to lure state cadres to take the bait:

Using money to seduce cadres is the most common method used by the bourgeoisie. According to many materials, it has become a common phenomenon to give rebates to purchasing personnel, give heavy "gifts" to tax personnel during festivals, and give money, watches, pens, and other valuable items to supervisors..., some even do it openly and brazenly. When Qu Fugang, an employee of the Shenyang Wholesale Station of the Yarn and Cloth Company, went to Dongjihao to inspect processed cloth for the first time, the manager Liu Shengdong "gave" him a gold ingot as soon as they met, forcing him to accept it as a "souvenir." The Shenyang Taiyang Tobacco Company bribed three tax personnel, giving them 10 billion Northeast currency at one time.

Using women to seduce cadres is also a method frequently used by illegal elements of the bourgeoisie. Teng Xisheng, the manager of the Shenyang Deshenghao Cosmetics Factory, used his concubine to seduce Guan Zhiying, a household registration clerk from a police station. One day, Teng Xisheng suddenly called Guan Zhiying over, holding a letter from Guan Zhiying to his concubine in his hand, and said: "The relationship between us two brothers is good. If you like your sister-in-law, just let her go with you. If your life is not enough, I will make up for it. As long as you take care of me when I do business." Guan Zhiying was dragged into the water by him. For example, Zhao Wenqing, the manager of the Wenxinghao Coking Plant, used his daughter as bait, marrying her to a salesman from the Coal Construction Company - Han Derun. After that, they colluded to steal a large amount of state coal. Zhao Wenqing often personally went to the First Business Department to direct the theft, and her daughter often went to the First Business Department in the name of visiting Han Derun to "supervise the battle." In order to use the "beauty trap" more, some treacherous merchants also specially collected some prostitutes, saying that they were their concubines, sisters-in-law, cousins, nieces, etc., specifically used to seduce cadres. They are truly profit-seeking and extremely shameless!

In addition to this, some treacherous merchants also use boasting, flattery, and compliments to soften certain cadres, and finally drag them into the water. For example, Xu Hongshan, a treacherous merchant from Jilin Yuhua Dyeing Factory, shouted loudly at a party held by the Federation of Industry and Commerce: "The first and second rows are reserved for the leaders." and put out cigarettes and fruits. When the section chief of the department store's processing section entered the venue, Xu Hongshan shouted loudly on the stage: "Everyone stand up and applaud!" After he softened some cadres with these methods, he dragged them step by step into the quagmire of corruption, and he made a great fortune in processing orders.

There are also many methods for the bourgeoisie to "send in." Some pretend to be progressive and sneak in; some are introduced through "planted spies" or using relationships such as classmates, fellow villagers, and relatives; some bring in their entire team under the cover of cooperation with state-owned enterprises. For example, Lan Yongmin, a treacherous merchant in Shenyang, pretended to be "progressive," claiming that he "did not want to be a merchant and wanted to make revolution," and tricked the "Northeast Rongjun Engineering Company" into getting close to state personnel more and more every day, and then bribed a lot and stole state property. Five cadres were corrupted by him. He bribed more than 210 million yuan, and the state lost 2.3 billion yuan. For example, Ji Jiazhen, an engineer from the Fittings Branch of the Shenyang Railway Factory, was originally the director of the private Yulin Iron Factory. Under the name of "dedicating his skills" and "repaying his debts," he infiltrated the Fittings Branch, stole a large amount of state wealth and production secrets, and introduced another treacherous merchant, Feng Lianyuan, to serve as a technician in the factory, stealing more than a dozen confidential drawings such as "three-way valves" and "locomotive generators," destroying the factory's production, while he monopolized the market for "three-way valves." For example, the treacherous merchant Zhu Jinghua, in the name of investing in a partnership, "brought" a part of broken machinery and tricked the Medical Equipment Department Director of the Medical Company into his position. He piled up the bad goods in the Medical Equipment Department of the Medical Company, while stealing the good goods to his own Jinghua Medical Equipment Company. He introduced everyone who bought goods to the Medical Equipment Department of the Medical Company to his own store, so that the state-owned company could not sell goods, while he made a fortune.

Usurping Leadership

After the illegal elements of the bourgeoisie completed the first step of "work" mentioned above, they then further corrupted these units through their agents and "planted spies" in state organs and state-owned enterprises, gradually controlling and usurping the leadership of these units in order to further steal a large amount of state wealth. This is a vicious tactic in the bourgeoisie's attack.

One way for illegal elements of the bourgeoisie to usurp leadership is to corrupt the original leading cadres of state organs or state-owned enterprises, causing them to degenerate and serve the bourgeoisie. This is a major method used by illegal elements of the bourgeoisie to usurp leadership today. Han Yongzan, the former Director of the Shenyang Municipal Administration of Industry and Commerce, is an example of degeneration: Han Yongzan fell into the abyss of corruption under the siege of treacherous merchants. He used his powers to help private merchants steal steel from state-owned enterprises and transport it to Tianjin for speculation and profit; he used public grain to privately open grain stores, receiving a large amount of grain and evading a large amount of taxes; he also arbitrarily destroyed the state personnel system, misusing personnel. There were as many as 40 "cadres" introduced to the industrial and commercial bureau system by Han Yongzan and his wife alone. For example, Wang Jiang, the former Deputy Manager of the Northeast China Petroleum Company, colluded to open the Xintai Oil Company after being dragged into the water by the treacherous merchant Qu Jingzhi. Wang Jiang used his powers to steal and leak business information. From April to October 1950 alone, the Xintai Oil Company transported 32 train cars of heavy diesel into the customs from the Petroleum Company one after another, engaging in speculation and seeking illegal profits, making the State Petroleum Company a warehouse for treacherous merchants.

Another way for illegal elements of the bourgeoisie to usurp leadership is to take advantage of the weaknesses of certain bureaucratic leaders in state organs and state-owned enterprises, use sweet words and pretend to be active to deceive them, so that they can monopolize power and do whatever they want. For example, Zhao Guangxin, one of the shareholders of the private Minsheng Iron Factory, infiltrated a state-owned enterprise as an electrical engineer. During the restoration and reconstruction of the Northeast No. 1 Glass Factory and the No. 1 Ceramics Factory, a project was estimated to cost 290 million yuan. Zhao Guangxin first negotiated with the treacherous merchant Chen Hongye and asked him to bargain for 500 million yuan, and then spread the word to the leading cadres: "Small families cannot do this project, only Minsheng is suitable, and they have contracted for it before." As a result, it was contracted out for 480 million yuan. For example, if the glass factory wanted to plane steel plates, the processing fee would only be 200,000 yuan per piece. Zhao Guangxin first colluded with a private merchant to bargain for 3 million yuan per piece, and he deliberately rejected it because it was too expensive. Then Chen Hongye came forward and contracted it for 2 million yuan per piece. He made ten times the illegal profit and also claimed that he "saved 1 million yuan for the public." For example, Liu Fude, the director of the Tiexi Oil Depot of the Petroleum Company, was a typical bureaucrat. He completely handed over the power of the oil depot to the custodian accountant Yue Weiren, who used this condition to steal a lot. According to preliminary statistics, the total value of his corruption reached more than 300 million yuan, causing the state to lose more than 440 million yuan.

There is another way for illegal elements of the bourgeoisie to usurp leadership, that is, through their "planted spies," to steal the leading positions of local organizations and even major leading positions in certain enterprises. For example, Li Zhenxiang, a treacherous merchant from the Fushun Changhai Iron Factory, sent Li Mingqi, the second shopkeeper, to infiltrate the oil factory, usurping the leadership of the basic construction section, and using this as a base to corrupt a group of cadres in the factory, causing the Changhai Iron Factory to steal state wealth worth 10 billion yuan one after another. Zhang Qinglian, a big treacherous merchant, infiltrated the Shenyang Rice Mill of the Department of Life of the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Railways and stole the position of acting factory director. He colluded internally and externally, claiming that the rice milling machine was too old and not easy to use, and sold 18 rice milling machines to private merchants as scrap iron.

Large-Scale Theft

After the illegal elements of the bourgeoisie usurped the leadership of state organs and state-owned enterprises, they then stole state wealth on a large scale. This is their main means of attacking state-owned enterprises and also an extremely vicious tactic. Using this most vicious method, the bourgeoisie not only weakened the strength of the state-owned economy, but also used this wealth to strengthen their power to attack the state-owned economy.

Cutting corners in processing orders is the main method used by illegal elements of the bourgeoisie to carry out theft activities. For example, after Chen Qi and other treacherous merchants from the Shenyang Jingcheng Rubber Factory bribed certain cadres of the Northeast China Department Store, they stole more than 10,000 catties of rubber materials, worth about 3 billion Northeast currency, when processing 55,000 pairs of sneakers for the department store in the fourth quarter of 1950. Due to the poor quality of the sneakers, 20,000 pairs could not be sold. Bi Changlu, the manager of the Xingya Iron Factory in Nan District, Shenyang, corrupted Gao Yiting, the former workshop director of the Five-Eye Workshop of the Rubber No. 7 Factory, and then contracted for the material procurement and processing orders of the Five-Eye Workshop, stealing state property worth more than 830 million yuan. Due to the poor quality of the processed products he contracted for, the workshop often could not complete its production tasks, and the losses caused to the state are even more incalculable. In addition, acts of cutting corners in grain and rice processing, knitwear processing, and other industries are also extremely common.

Speculating and obtaining a large amount of illegal profits in the work of selling products or purchasing raw materials for the state is another method used by illegal elements of the bourgeoisie to carry out theft activities. Li Shouting, the manager of Songmaohao in Harbin, bribed Sun Guangwen, a coal salesman from a certain company, and forced Sun Guangwen to only sell coal to him, not to others, monopolizing the coal market in Harbin. Therefore, Li Shouting quickly jumped from being the manager of a small coal factory to becoming a giant in the Harbin coal market. There are a total of 22 private coal factories in Harbin, five of which belong to Li Shouting, and Li Shouting also has shares in another five. Guo Yuxiu, the manager of the Zhengdong Hardware Store in Shenyang, bribed the material section chief of the Bridge Factory of the Shenyang Railway Administration and others, and then completely controlled the factory's procurement plan and stole state economic intelligence 15 times.

The most vicious way for illegal elements of the bourgeoisie to steal state wealth is to send "planted spies" to state-owned enterprises, and then collude internally and externally to carry out large-scale theft in a planned manner. In Dalian Department Store, 92% of the employees are sent in a planned way by treacherous merchants. Many of these people are informants of private merchants. When prices change, merchants know it first and rush to buy it. The leader of the watch group is a famous watch merchant in Dalian, who often exchanges his own broken watches for the company's good watches and buys new watches at low prices, making a profit of 50%. Shi Zhiping, a treacherous merchant in Harbin, infiltrated the Municipal Trust Company in 1950 and served as a fur salesman. When the state had cheap fur to be sold by the Trust Company, he notified private merchants to buy it in large quantities, and then converted it at a high price, jointly operated by the company and private merchants, and he handed the warehouse over to private merchants for management, so the treacherous merchants repeatedly stole huge amounts of state funds. The largest case is the case of gold and silver operators in Qiqihar stealing and defrauding the state of gold: the treacherous merchant Wu Yizhi sent his son Wu Chengzhang to the State Bank, mixed with the work of receiving and inspecting gold and silver, so Wu Yizhi and others forged gold bars and silver with broken copper and scrap iron, and sold them to the state through Wu Chengzhang. From 1947 to 1950, they sold more than 40,000 taels of broken copper as silver to the state, and sold gold mixed with 5% fake as 10% gold to the state, which weighed 50,000 watts.

In addition to stealing state property, the bourgeoisie also stole a large amount of state economic intelligence and production technical secrets. For example, Du Zhiping, a shareholder of Dalian Hengjutai Iron Company, infiltrated the Dalian Branch of the China Industrial Equipment Company and became a purchasing and sales representative. In 1950, a certain state-owned factory wanted to sell more than 100 tons of agricultural iron to the Industrial Equipment Company, and Du Zhiping replied, "The company does not want it." At the same time, he notified Hengjutai Iron Company to buy it, and then sold it to the company at a high price a few days later, making a profit of more than 300 million yuan. For example, the Industrial Equipment Company was preparing to set up a station in Xianglufang to acquire hardware, and Hengjutai took the lead in acquiring more than 3,000 tons of hardware and reselling it to the company, making a profit of more than 300 million yuan. For example, in the five cases of stealing technical secrets recently cracked by the Fushun Mining Bureau, the treacherous merchant Wang Kechun stole the oil degumming technology and the method of manufacturing activated clay, and then opened his own factory, earning a large amount of illegal profits. The treacherous merchant Fu Zhendong bribed 120 million yuan and stole the secret of electrode manufacturing. The treacherous merchant Zhang Wenfu stole the entire drawing of a certain planer, the only one in the country, which was painstakingly researched by all the workers and technicians of the electromechanical plant for more than a year. Also, Shenyang treacherous merchants Shen Jie and Liu Yongci bought the technician Su Fengqin from the smelting plant and used the laboratory equipment of the smelting plant to test raw materials for the Hongxing Alloy Manufacturing Factory and stole certain technical production secrets of the smelting plant...

In short, many illegal elements of the bourgeoisie started their business by stealing and became rich by stealing. This is how they launched a rampant attack.

Corrupting Staff

The result of the bourgeoisie's rampant attack, in addition to causing serious damage to the country's wealth, also caused many state personnel to be dragged into the abyss of depravity and corruption, breaking away from the revolutionary ranks. For example, Jiang Yanchang, the director of the Jiahe Timber Factory, was seduced by the treacherous merchant Liang Qifa, stole state property, and privately opened a timber factory in Changchun, betraying the country and the people and becoming a huge thief. For example, the treacherous merchant Zeng Zhaoxiang from Jilin used his concubine as bait

    资产阶级猖狂进攻的铁证
    齐龙
    （一）是资产阶级猖狂进攻呢还是人民政府采取“削平”政策呢
    去年年终，毛主席号召全国人民和一切工作人员，大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地开展一个大规模的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，将旧社会遗留下来的污毒洗干净。
    全国人民响应了毛主席的号召，首先在中国共产党内部、在人民政府内部、在人民解放军以及人民团体内部，展开了反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的运动。其后又在工商业界中展开了反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争。
    反贪污斗争和反盗窃斗争，就其本质来说，都是为了打退资产阶级向工人阶级及其所领导的中国人民革命事业所举行的猖狂进攻。三年来，资产阶级在猖狂的进攻中，在经济方面，已把大量的国家财富盗为私有，任意挥霍，以致危害了抗美援朝和国家建设的伟大事业；在政治方面，它把若干国家机关全部地或局部地篡夺了，把许多革命干部腐蚀陷害了。因而，我们必须把资产阶级这种反动的进攻压下去，才能巩固中国人民革命的胜利，并为我们祖国走向社会主义铺平道路。
    可是直到今天，还有一些资产阶级分子，制造各种谰言，极力为资产阶级猖狂进攻作辩护。有的说：“东北工商业者早已没有生意可作了，现在又要反盗窃，今后宁可把东西扔了也不卖给工作人员，省说行贿。”有的说：“政府总说我们是奸商，多咱把商人脑瓜削平了，才能说我们不是奸商了。”显然的，这些都是完全不合实际的而且又是十分恶毒的诽谤。
    事实上，东北的私人工商业，不是没有发展而是发展得很快的。以工业生产来看，虽然东北的国营工业规模很大，但是私营工业的生产总值仍然年复一年地迅速增加着。其增长速度如以一九四九年为一○○，那末，一九五○年则为一三二，一九五一年则为一八二·四。至于私营商业的发展则更快，一九五一年年底，全东北市场零售总额，私营商业仍占二分之一左右。沈阳市私营商业，一九五一年一月为一五、四九六户，六月增至一六、九○○户；其营业额以一月为一○○，到六月即为一三一·四，至九月为一八九·三。事实证明，无论在“九一八”以前、或在日寇占领时期、或在国民党统治时期，东北工商业者都从来没有像最近几年内这样繁荣过。也正因为资产阶级在政治上有了一定地位，在经济上又日益获得发展，因此最近数年来，他们虽然一面承认中国工人阶级的领导，可是另一面却在各方面尽量扩大其思想影响，并采取各种方法和形式，在政治上和经济上和工人阶级争夺领导权。他们企图把我们的国家拖离新民主主义——社会主义的轨道；而听凭资本主义的自由泛滥，按照资本主义的道路发展。他们煞费苦心地、无微不至地腐蚀国家工作人员，打入了国家的政权和经济组织，企图使人民民主专政的政权脱离无产阶级的领导，而让资产阶级独吞人民胜利的果实。这究竟是他们在举行着猖狂的进攻呢，还是人民政府要“削平”他们的“脑瓜”？下面所举的一些事实（这不过是资产阶级猖狂进攻的一个很小的部分）将回答这个问题。
    （二）从经济上到政治上的全面进攻
    根据目前东北各地的材料看来，资产阶级的进攻是无孔不入的，他们将其腐臭万分的吸血管，伸入中国共产党内部，伸向人民政府及人民解放军内部，也伸向人民团体内部，特别是伸向国家经济机关和国营企业内部，以达其腐蚀革命队伍、侵吞人民胜利果实的恶毒目的。他们通过大量行贿、偷税漏税、偷工减料、盗窃国家资财、盗窃国家经济情报等违法行为，使国家损失了大量财富，使我们国防建设和经济建设遭到重大的不可补偿的损害。
    资产阶级之所以在经济战线上展开特别猛烈的进攻，一则由于这是一种比较隐蔽的斗争，一般的不大容易被人发现；一则由于国营经济乃是新民主主义社会的物质基础，这个基础遭到破坏，就将直接影响我们国家的前途。因此资产阶级的这种进攻，就其最终结果来说，对国家的危害，将不仅是经济上的损失，而且是直接损害抗美援朝斗争，影响国家经济发展前途，这是对千百万人民生活的进攻，是一个从经济上到政治上的猖狂的攻势。
    削弱国营经济
    资产阶级进攻国家经济机关和国营企业的一种方式，是通过各种办法以削弱国营经济的力量，这是今天普遍而大量存在着的一种情况。
    资产阶级削弱国营经济的一种方法，就是采取各种各样盗窃办法以造成国营企业的损失。例如国家钢铁生产目前还十分不足，而天津的一群奸商，贿赂了东北某制钢厂副厂长等若干干部，先后偷窃钢材七百吨，其中一半是特殊钢料。国家电信器材生产不足，许多材料都从国外进口，而沈阳奸商王占恒，勾引了东北邮电总局仓库主任，偷去大批贵重器材。为了经济建设日益发展的需要，国家正大力发展采煤事业，而华兴科学仪器社奸商刘文涛，却偷窃了全国有数的几台救命器和数台苏生器及其它贵重仪器，共值十五亿元。
    另一种办法，就是在加工定货中偷工减料，造成生产和供应的损失。例如奸商王正，混入抚顺化工厂，窃居厂长职位，和其它奸商合谋包修该厂工程，由于工程质量不好，某项工程寿命便缩短了八年使用时间；另一项工程，仅发生了一次事故，就使该厂停工二月之久；连同其它各项损失，其总值足够该厂全体工人吃用十一年。又如哈尔滨市私营建大、中大、丰大三鞋厂，给百货公司加工棉鞋，由于偷工减料，大批鞋子不合规格，群众对百货公司极为不满，松江省百货公司不得不下令全部停售，严重地影响了国家供应工作。
    还有一种办法，就是钻进国营企业和合作经济系统，利用职权，有意积压国营企业产品，扩大私商产品推销。例如奸商齐长庚等，钻入合作货栈，盗用合作社资金十五亿元（仅初步查明材料）投机倒把、开设工厂，又利用合作社系统大量倾销他们的劣等产品，使各地合作社因劣货滞销、资金积压而损失严重。又如沈阳百货公司职员戴明哲，和奸商勾结，把私营企业生产的墨水摆满了百货公司文具部的柜台，而国营工厂的产品则只摆出一瓶，使国营产品积压了两年多。
    控制国营企业
    资产阶级进攻国家经济机关和国营企业的另一种方式，是用里应外合的办法，控制篡夺某些国营企业或者该企业的部分组织，使之变质。中国医药公司东北区公司经理罗惠春被“糖衣炮弹”打倒，垂手让出阵地，就是一个显明的例子。在罗惠春案件暴露前，由于资产阶级代理人大批钻进中国医药公司东北区公司，结果该公司职员中，商人出身及现在仍为商人者达三十一人，被拉下水的干部五人；九个科长中，四个是商人出身，两个是有意钻进去的“坐探”。这样，医药公司就被攻得遍体鳞伤，完全丧失了国营企业的性质。又如奸商韩益民，一九五○年将他经营的永发源代理店出兑给沈阳市信托公司后，组成第二货栈，即带领其全班人马钻入信托公司，韩益民窃取了营业股杂货组长职务，又和其它私商勾结，利用第二货栈为据点，扩大其进攻的规模。
    向党政军民的全面进攻
    正如前面所说，资产阶级的进攻是无孔不入的，他们不仅恶毒地伤害了我们的国营经济，而且对中国共产党的组织、对人民政府机关、对人民解放军、对工会组织以及对科学文化团体等各个方面，都无不进行着猖狂的渗透和侵蚀。
    资产阶级对中国共产党组织的进攻，可以蛟河县委事件做一个最好的说明：吉林省一个贩卖毒品的流氓商人——梁启发，从一九四六年起，用百般无赖的手段，向当时蛟河城关区区长殷子华和区政府助理员崔晓光进攻，并把他们拖下水去，合伙贩毒牟利。一九四九年以后，殷子华任蛟河县委书记兼县长，崔晓光任青年团县委书记，他们的各种罪恶活动更加猖獗，梁启发仅在倒弄木板一项生意中，即牟利十亿元以上。而以蜕化分子殷子华为首的中共蛟河县委员会，包括公安局长任国财、税务局长贺纹、县委组织部长孟雅树等，则变成一个贪污集团，整个党委组织已被资产阶级腐蚀而变了质。
    资产阶级进攻人民政府的罪行也为数不少：齐齐哈尔福仁合制材厂奸商周龙川，解放后伪装进步，窃取市人民政府委员之职，然后就像传染病菌一样在人民政府内部，侵蚀着各个部门，先后被他腐蚀的干部，有内蒙修建委员会赵述学，以及齐齐哈尔市建设局、黑龙江省百货公司、齐齐哈尔市粮食公司、铁路局货物处、齐齐哈尔市三区合作社干部多人。又如鞍山市八大家私营铁工厂，篡夺了市政府生产企业科的领导权，包揽加工定货、哄抬市价，排挤中小铁工厂，使市政府生产企业科变成了只为“八大家”资产阶级服务的工具。又如吉林省财政厅副厅长周化南，当了资产阶级的俘虏，动用大批公款交奸商张文义投机倒把、委任经济内奸阎閻为吉林省财政厅驻天津推销处主任，并引用一些政治面目不清的人到政府机关内工作……这都证明了资产阶级的违法分子们，是如何猖狂地向着人民政府不断地放射出恶毒的暗箭。
    资产阶级违法分子同样居心叵测地从各方面损害人民解放军的干部和战士，损害人民解放军在人民中的崇高的信誉：奸商姚廷舜，购买大批痘猪，卖给部队；企东电力工业社，承包某部工程，向一位科长行贿十二个金元宝，偷盗建筑资材东北币七十余亿元；哈尔滨工友表店奸商卫太和，冒充军官，私造关防，计有“解放军坦克部队二六、二八小队”、“中国人民公安部队第一纵队”等六七种之多，以遂其贩运私货投机倒把的目的。
    资产阶级利用私营企业中工会组织的薄弱无力，大肆进攻。抚顺义和造纸厂经理引诱工会主席董宝泰陷入贪污泥淖后，公开胁迫他道：“你有把柄在我手，牵着鼻子跟我走。”隆泰织布厂资本家篡夺了工会领导，经理当了工会主席，便向工人展开了猖狂的进攻：徒工每日工作十八小时，每月工资仅二万五千元，工人提出意见，资本家还给戴上一顶帽子：“你敢不爱国吗？爱国就得完成国家加工任务！”这是多么堂皇的口号啊！许多的资本家，正是百般破坏工会组织，并利用了广大职工对祖国的热爱和积极的生产情绪，百般剥削，营私舞弊，以餍其损人利己唯利是图的欲望。
    这里再举一个例子——仅仅是无数事件中的一个事件，请看看资产阶级又是如何向科学、文化事业进攻。沈阳有一家自然科学仪器馆（私商），经理叫张铭，在他无数罪行中有这样三件罪行：一是把全国一百三十处厂矿、科学研究所的地址及负责人编号，准备有计划地打入内部。一是偷窃了某些厂矿和文化教育机关购买仪器的材料目录，并派遣内奸按照目录从国家机关中偷窃出来或从他处贩运去，转手高价卖给国家。还有一件，就是他制订了一个“十年计划”，从一九五○年十一月起，准备在十年内，用各种非法手段扩大他的“事业”，计成立八个部、三个工厂、十余处办事处，企图以此全部或大部控制中国科学仪器的进口和制造工作。
    当然，最令人难于容忍的，莫过于资产阶级向我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军的进攻。资产阶级违法分子丧心病狂暗害志愿军的罪行，除了上海、南京、武汉等地已揭发出用坏牛肉作罐头，以含菌棉花作急救包，以及偷骗志愿军医药巨款等严重违法行为外，东北各地也先后发现不少类似案件。如奸商杨文运承做汽车防滑链，以废料换好料，以废品充合格品，致使防滑链运到前方，大批不能使用，严重地破坏了军事运输。奸商王仁发以朽木承制桥板，经常被载重车压坏，影响运输，奸商李雁双偷盗志愿军汽车零件，严重危害了前线军运。又如沈阳市鸿泰、公大等十九家粮米加工业，在给志愿军加工粮米时，合谋降低出米率，集体在加工米中搀糠搀砂，他们偷取了志愿军的口粮，而吃肥了自己的肚皮。奸商张明中等，有的制造假药送给志愿军，有的混入医院以假药换真药，向志愿军伤病员的生命开火。诸如以上行为，绝不是个别现象。这些人对人民革命事业的进攻，难道不是已达极点了吗？他们还有一点中国人的气味吗？因此，这些消息公布后，立即引起社会各界群众的愤恨，要求政府严惩这些奸商。人民的义愤，是完全正义的，也是完全可以理解的。请问资产阶级的先生们：不正是由于志愿军的艰苦作战，保卫了祖国的安全，打退了美帝国主义向我们祖国的进攻吗？不正是由于志愿军的胜利战斗，保卫了全国人民以及你们自己的生命财产吗？志愿军在冰天雪地前仆后继地战斗着，而你们在后方和平环境里投机取巧大发横财还不算，反而恩将仇报，从背后向他们放出恶毒的冷箭，暗害他们，这是何居心呢？这还有
    一点人性吗？难道还有比这更猖狂更恶毒更卑鄙无耻的进攻吗？
    以上我们还仅仅是列举了资产阶级千百万件罪行中的极其微小的一部分材料。根据这些材料，我们已完全可以作出这样的结论：资产阶级的进攻，乃是一个猖狂的全面的进攻，是无可置疑的了。
    （三）资产阶级进攻的手法
    高岗同志在一月十日东北局召开的高级干部会议上的报告指出：“资产阶级对于党的侵蚀是多方面的，其主要的方法是两条：拉过去，派进来。”
    所谓“拉过去”，就是资产阶级恶毒地利用各种卑鄙无耻的办法来勾引和陷害国家机关和企业中的工作人员，使他们一步一步陷入贪污腐化的泥坑，变成资产阶级安置在国家机关、国营企业和合作事业中的代理人。
    所谓“派进来”，就是资产阶级利用各种伪装，欺骗我们某些领导机关的官僚主义者，或者通过和他们狼狈为奸的分子的关系，派遣他们的子女、亲戚或亲信分子钻入国家机关、国营企业或合作社中；或者在各种掩饰和藉口下，把自己的商店加以改头换面，名义上变为国家商店或合作社，而进行其投机倒把、盗窃国家资财的活动。他们“派进来”的目的，正如高岗同志所指出的：“他们进来不是为国家商店与合作社服务，而是为资本家服务。一些地方的国家商店、合作社被其篡夺领导，倒换货物，偷窃商情，囤积居奇，捣乱市场，把国家的企业机构，作为资本家盗公肥私、投机牟利的工具。”
    “拉过去”和“派进来”，虽然方式不一样，但其目的则只有一个，这就是：腐蚀国家机关和企业中的某些工作人员和局部的组织，篡夺工人阶级的领导权，进行大规模的盗窃活动。
    入门“法宝”
    违法资本家把国家工作人员“拉过去”的办法是花样繁多的，一般的说，首先是用交朋友、请客送礼、公开行贿和美人计，诱你上钩。
    在没有列举这些事实之前，让我们先引用长春一个奸商毕克明的自供，看看资产阶级违法分子是如何用尽苦心地诱惑我们的干部。毕克明写道：“我为了弄钱到手，用旧社会那一套恶劣手段，千方百计地勾搭、引诱干部，讲的是‘放长线、钓大鱼’。上煤业建筑公司买货时，腰里就揣上上等烟卷，逢人就送，为的是在大家眼中留个‘好’印象。进一步就‘唠家常’、‘打探心情’，譬如问：‘你挣多少分啊？’‘家有几口人？’瞅着对方搭楂，就进行引诱：‘你们真够苦啊！’‘我这个人最好交朋友，用钱尽管说话，多少都行！’有时还硬拉乡亲关系，有的人一点一点就叫我拉拢上了。”
    现在，我们再来看看资产阶级引诱国家干部上钩的几种主要花招：
    用金钱引诱干部的办法，是资产阶级最常用的一种方法。根据很多材料看来，对采买人员送回扣，对税务人员逢年过节送重“礼”，对监工人员送金钱、送手表、钢笔等贵重物品……，几乎已成普遍现象，有的甚至明目张胆公开进行。花纱布公司沈阳批发站职员曲福刚，第一次到东记号检查加工布时，经理刘生东见面就“送”给一个金元宝，强迫他收下，叫做“留作纪念”。沈阳太阳烟草公司向三个税务人员行贿，一次就给一百亿元东北币。
    用女人来引诱干部，也是资产阶级违法分子经常使用的一种办法。沈阳德生号化妆品工厂经理滕希生，用自己的小老婆勾引了一个派出所的户口员关致英后，一天，滕希生突然把关致英找去，手中拿着关致英给他小老婆的一封信，说道：“咱们哥俩的感情不错，如果你喜欢你大嫂，就叫她跟你去吧，你生活不足，我还补足一些，只要你在大哥做买卖时照顾照顾。”关致英就被他拖下水了。又如文兴号炼焦厂经理赵文卿，把自己的女儿作钓饵，嫁给煤建公司一个推销员——韩德润，以后就合谋大量盗窃国家煤炭，赵文卿经常亲至第一营业部指挥偷盗，她女儿也常以探望韩德润为名，至第一营业部去“督战”。为了更多地使用“美人计”，有些奸商还专门收罗一些娼妓，说是自己的什么小老婆、小姨子、表妹、妻侄女、外甥女等，专门用来引诱干部。真是唯利是图，无耻之尤！
    除此而外，有一些奸商，还用吹牛拍马、恭维捧场的办法，来软化某些干部，最后拖他下水。例如吉林裕华染厂奸商许洪山，在工商联合会举行晚会时，满场嚷嚷：“头排、二排是给首长留的。”并摆上香烟水果。当百货公司加工科科长等进场时，许洪山又在台上高呼：“全场起立，鼓掌欢迎！”他用这些办法软化了一些干部后，就又一步一步地把他们拖到贪污的泥坑里去，而在加工定货中，他却大大发了横财。
    资产阶级“派进来”的方法也是很多的。有的是伪装进步混进来的；有的是通过“坐探”，或利用同学、同乡、亲戚等关系介绍进来的；有的是在和国营企业合作的掩护下而全班人马打进来的。例如沈阳市奸商蓝拥民，他伪装“进步”，扬言“不愿意作商人，愿意革命”，骗取了“东北荣军工程公司”的招牌，和国家工作人员接近日多，便大量行贿，并偷窃国家资财，被他腐蚀的干部有五名，他行贿二亿一千多万元，而国家则损失了二十三亿。又如沈阳铁路工厂配件分厂工程师吉家祯，原是私营玉林铁工厂的厂长，以“献技”“还债”为名，混入配件分厂后，大量盗窃国家财富和生产机密，并介绍另一奸商冯连元至该厂充当技术员，先后偷窃了“三通阀”“机车发电机”等机密图纸十余种，破坏了工厂生产，而自己却垄断了“三通阀”的市场。再如奸商祝景华，以入股合伙为名，“带”来一部分破烂器械，骗取了医药公司器械部主任的职位，他一面把坏货堆满医药公司器械部，一面却把好货偷到自己的景华医疗器械行去，到医药公司器械部买货的人，他都介绍到自己店里去，使国家公司卖不到钱，而他则大发其财。
    篡夺领导
    资产阶级违法分子完成了以上第一步“工作”以后，紧接着就通过他们在国家机关和国营企业中的代理人和“坐探”，进一步腐蚀这些单位，逐步地控制和篡夺这些单位的领导大权，以便进一步大量地盗窃国家财富。这是资产阶级进攻中的一项毒辣的手段。
    资产阶级违法分子篡夺领导的一种方法，就是腐蚀国家机关或国营企业原有的领导干部，使之蜕化变质，为资产阶级服务。这是今天资产阶级违法分子篡夺领导的一项主要办法。沈阳市前任工商局长韩永赞就是蜕化变质的一个例子：韩永赞在奸商的围攻下，堕入了贪污腐化的深渊。他利用职权，帮助私商从国营企业盗取钢铁，运至天津投机牟利；他用公家的粮食，私自开设粮店，大量领粮，大量漏税；他并任意破坏国家人事制度，乱用人员，仅韩永赞夫妇介绍至工商局系统的“干部”，就有四十名之多。又如前东北区石油公司副经理王江，被奸商曲敬之拖下水后，合伙开办信泰油行。王江利用职权，偷漏商情，仅一九五○年四月至十月，信泰油行即先后从石油公司运走三十二火车皮的重柴油入关，投机倒把，谋取非法利润，使国家石油公司，成了奸商的仓库。
    资产阶级违法分子篡夺领导的另一种方法，就是利用国家机关和国营企业中某些官僚主义领导者的弱点，用甜言蜜语和假装积极迷惑了他们，而使自己独揽大权，为非作歹。例如私营民生铁工厂股东之一的赵光炘，钻进国营企业充当了电气工程师，在东北第一玻璃厂和第一陶瓷厂恢复重建时期，某项工程，估价二亿九千万元，赵光炘先和奸商陈洪业商妥，要他讨价五亿元，后又到领导干部面前放风：“这工程小家不能做，只有民生合适，早先还包过工。”结果以四亿八千万元包了出去。又如玻璃厂要刨钢板，加工费只需二十万元一块，赵光炘先串通一家私商到厂里去讨价三百万元，他故意嫌贵，加以拒绝，然后以陈洪业出面，用二百万元一块包了下来，他获了十倍的非法利润，还扬言“为公家少花一百万元”。又如石油公司铁西油仓主任刘福德，是个典型的官僚主义分子，他将油仓大权完全交给保管会计岳维仁，岳维仁就利用了这个条件，大肆盗窃，仅据初步统计，其贪污总值即达三亿元以上，使国家损失四亿四千余万元。
    资产阶级违法分子篡夺领导，还有一种办法，这就是通过自己的“坐探”，窃取某些企业中局部组织的领导职位甚至主要领导职位。例如抚顺长海铁工厂奸商李振祥，派遣二掌柜的李鸣岐钻进制油厂，篡夺了基本修建科的领导权，并以此为基点，腐蚀了厂内一批干部，使长海铁工厂先后偷盗国家财富达一百亿元。大奸商张清连钻进铁道部驻东北特派员办事处生计部沈阳制米厂，窃踞了代理厂长的职位，里勾外连，扬言制米机太旧，不好使，前后把十八台制米机当废铁卖给了私商。
    大量盗窃
    资产阶级违法分子篡夺了国家机关和国营企业的领导权以后，随着就大量地盗窃国家财富，这是他们进攻国营企业的主要手段，也是一种极端毒辣的手段。资产阶级用这种最恶毒的办法，既使国营经济力量被削弱，而同时又使他们以这些财富壮大其进攻国营经济的力量。
    在加工定货中，偷工减料，是资产阶级违法分子盗窃活动的主要方法。例如沈阳竞成橡胶厂奸商陈琦等，向东北区百货公司某些干部行贿后，一九五○年第四季度给百货公司加工五万五千双球鞋时，就偷窃胶料一万余斤，约值三十亿元东北币，由于球鞋质量低劣，有两万双鞋销不出去。沈阳南市区兴亚铁工厂经理毕长禄，腐蚀了橡胶七厂五眼车间前任车间主任高义亭后，包揽了五眼车间的材料采购和加工定货，先后盗窃国家资财八亿三千多万元，由于他承包的加工品质量不好，使该车间经常不能完成生产任务，给国家所造成的损失，更无法计算。此外，在粮米加工、针织品加工等行业中，偷工减料的行为，也极为普遍。
    在替国家代销产品或采购原料工作中，投机取巧、获取大量非法利润，是资产阶级违法分子盗窃活动的另一种方法。哈尔滨松茂号经理奸商李寿亭，向某公司煤炭推销员孙广文行贿后，逼令孙广文只能把煤炭交他推销，不能卖给别人，垄断了哈尔滨的煤炭市场。因此，李寿亭很快地就由一个小煤厂的经理，一跃而为哈尔滨煤炭市场上的巨头。哈尔滨共有二十二家私人煤厂，五家是李寿亭的，另外五家也有李寿亭的股份。沈阳市正东五金行经理郭聿修，向沈阳铁路管理局桥梁厂材料股长等行贿后，全部控制了该厂采购计划，并先后偷盗国家经济情报十五次。
    资产阶级违法分子盗窃国家财富的最毒辣的办法，就是派遣“坐探”到国营企业，然后里勾外连，有计划地大规模地进行盗窃。大连百货公司，营业员百分之九十二是奸商有计划派进来的，这些人很多是私商的情报员，物价一变，商人即先知道，并争先抢购。钟表组组长，就是大连有名的钟表商，经常以自己坏表，换公司好表，以低价套购新表，从中得利百分之五十。哈尔滨奸商石执亭，一九五○年混入市信托公司任皮毛营业员，国家有廉价皮毛要信托公司推销时，他通知私商大量套购，然后再以高价折算，由公司和私商合营，而他又把仓库交私商管理，于是奸商们便反复地盗窃国家巨额款项。案件最大者，更有齐齐哈尔金银业者盗骗国家黄金案：奸商武益芝，将他的儿子武成章派入国家银行，混上了收验金银的工作，于是武益芝等便以破铜烂铁，伪造金条白银，通过武成章卖给国家，自一九四七年至一九五○年间，共把破铜当白银卖给国家四万两以上，把搀假百分之五的黄金当十成金卖给国家五万瓦。
    资产阶级除了盗窃国家财物外，还大量偷盗国家经济情报和生产技术秘密。例如大连恒聚泰铁行股东都致平，钻进中国工业器材公司旅大分公司，当上了采购兼推销员。一九五○年，某国营工厂想卖给工业器材公司百余吨农具铁，都致平回答说：“公司不要”。同时却通知恒聚泰铁行买入，几天后又高价卖给公司；工业器材公司正准备在香炉燋设站收购五金，而恒聚泰又抢了先，收购了三千余吨五金，转手卖给公司，获利三亿多元。又如抚顺矿务局新近破获的五件盗窃技术机密案，其中奸商王克春，盗窃了油脂脱色技术和制造活性白土的方法，然后自己开办工厂，获得大量非法利润。奸商傅振东，以一亿二千万元行贿，盗窃了电极制造的秘密。奸商张文福，盗窃了机电厂全体工友和技术人员经过一年多苦心研究出来的全国唯一的某种刨床的全图。还有，沈阳奸商申杰和刘永慈，收买了冶炼厂技术员苏奉钦，利用冶炼厂化验室设备，给洪兴合金制造厂化验原料，并盗取了冶炼厂某几种技术生产秘密……。
    总之，许多资产阶级违法分子，就是这样靠盗窃起家，靠盗窃致富。他们就是这样进行猖狂的进攻。
    腐蚀工作人员
    资产阶级猖狂进攻的结果，除了使国家财富遭到严重的损害外，同时也使很多国家工作人员，被拉入堕落腐化的深渊，脱离革命队伍。例如蛟河制材厂厂长姜言昌，受奸商梁启发勾引，盗取国家财产，私自在长春开设制材厂，叛变了国家和人民，而成了一名巨盗。又如吉林奸商曾兆祥，以自己的小老婆作钓饵，勾引上了长白火碱厂厂长郭雅伦，然后曾兆祥就唆使郭雅伦携款潜逃。我们再引一段沈阳公安员苑喜明的自述，看一看资产阶级已如何地腐蚀了我们的某些国家工作人员。苑喜明出身贫农，土地改革时分得了房子田地，一九四七年参军，在和敌人作战中曾经立过大功，也曾在毛主席像前举手宣过誓：要为共产主义事业奋斗到底。但是结果如何呢：“在奸商的拉拢利诱下，我已严重地沾染了资产阶级的腐化享乐思想，成天昏昏沉沉，满脑袋吃喝玩乐。我竟感到革命工作‘紧张’，‘太苦’，还有批评与自我批评，不‘自由’。无心思工作，和同志们说不来；对革命抱着两条心……我想，我也买上一辆汽车，自己又会开，和任凤同一样地当商人，又有钱，又享乐，有多么好啊！”
    一脚踢开
    唯利是图的资产阶级，当其“用上”某些国家工作人员时，他们是如何千方百计，毕恭毕敬地勾引你。但是，一旦从你身上得不到好处时，则他们立即显出另一副面孔，凶恶地把你一脚踢开。旧小说镜花缘中所描绘的两面国人的形象，正是这些奸商的化身。吉林市百货公司加工科王德俊，也就是前面所提及过的吉林裕华染厂许洪山在工商联合会上要“全场起立、鼓掌欢迎”的“首长”之一；其时，王德俊搬家到吉林，许洪山及永吉织布厂经理等人，给找房子、装烟筒、铺炕席，殷勤的无微不至。可是王德俊调到沈阳，他的妻子临产在即，想在吉林多住几天，而奸商们毫不容情的撵他搬家，说：“谁管你生孩子，你在马路上养孩子我也管不着。”轻工业管理局第四造纸厂材料员杨桂山的下场，更是凄惨。杨桂山在沈阳作采买工作时，奸商张德文像苍蝇一样地叮上了他，说尽了甜言蜜语。三天不见面，张德文就得给杨桂山打电话：“兄弟吗？你可把哥哥惦记坏了！”杨桂山的老婆到沈阳，张德文把她接到自己家中，当“老太太”一样孝敬。原因是张德文从杨桂山身上可以捞到大量的金钱。以后，杨桂山被派到哈尔滨工作，不用现款采买，物资多由公家调拨，张德文看到刮不下“油水”来，就立即变了脸，百般虐待杨桂山的老婆，要撵她出去，要强奸她，甚至竟强逼她去作娼妓，杨桂山回沈阳搬他老婆时，又被他勒索了一百多万元人民币和一个金镏子，临出门时还凶暴地把他的雨衣硬扒下去。
        ×    ×    ×    ×
    诸如这类的例子，是举不胜举的。但是至今还有一部分资产阶级分子，为了掩盖其罪恶行为，他们把行贿说成是“交朋友”，“人情之常”；“我们花了钱，政府还说我们拉拢干部，太冤枉了”。他们把盗窃国家资财说成是正当的“经营”，把人民反盗窃的斗争说成是“对有钱的商人，不要命的给扣帽子”。试问：用金钱、美女，甚至不惜用自己的老婆和女儿勾引工作人员，把他们拖下贪污腐化的绝路，这还是对待“朋友”的办法吗？用小恩小惠，骗取大量国家财富，以至盗窃国家经济情报，进行破坏抗美援朝和国家建设的罪恶交易，这还是正当的“经营”吗？今天人民政府为了维护国家人民利益，来惩办你们这些罪恶行为，这难道不是天经地义理所当然的事，难道还是给你们“扣帽子”吗？对于你们这些腐蚀国家工作人员、盗窃国家资财的罪行，如果不予以严厉的制裁，那么，人民革命胜利的果实和我们国家伟大庄严的建设还有什么保障呢！
    （四）资产阶级进攻是大规模的、其违法行为是大量存在的
    我们承认，今天中国的资产阶级并不都是违法乱纪的分子，他们中间，有少数是守法的和基本守法的，但大多数是半违法半守法的，还有一部分是严重违法和完全违法的，就是资产阶级的各种违法行为，也有轻重之别。但是，无数事实说明，真正守法的资本家是为数极少，而资产阶级的违法行为，则是大量存在的。因此，绝不能把资产阶级的进攻看成是少数人物的偶然活动，而不可否认的，那是整个阶级的进攻。
    严重的违法乱纪
    根据各地反盗窃运动总的情况来看，资产阶级的违法行为是十分严重的。以沈阳市为例，截至二月十四日为止，市节约检查委员会收到坦白材料五万三千零二十八件，检举材料三万零一百九十二件，而沈阳市工商业者一共是三万七千户。再以个别案件来看，许多巨大的偷盗行为，无不牵连很广，甚至整个行业全部参与罪行。例如前面曾经提及过的齐齐哈尔市奸商武益芝盗骗国家银行黄金案，参加盗骗行为者，包括了齐齐哈尔全市大小金银店。又如沈阳市的五金行，他们形容自己暴富的情况时说：“上有天堂，下有五金行，捎带西药房。”他们几乎无例外地靠偷漏国税、盗窃国家经济情报等不法行为而大发横财，他们有组织有计划地形成商业投机集团。在粮米加工业、制材业、染织业等行业当中，行贿、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、偷税漏税等违法情况也都成了公开的秘密，有的甚至采取集体行动，向国家进攻。这难道还能说是个别奸商的罪恶行为吗？
    其次，我们再以资产阶级违法行为的一种——偷税漏税——的情况来看，也同样可以看到资产阶级的进攻乃是普遍而严重的现象。根据东北税务局查获了的偷税漏税案件，一九四九年全东北为四九、一七五件，一九五○年为一一七、三六○件，一九五一年仅截至十一月为止，即达一三九、○六八件。若从偷税数额进行分析：一九五○年，被税务机关查获后追补的税款，为东北币九○七亿元，而一九五一年，则激增至人民币一八八亿余元，如将东北币与人民币以十比一折算，即一年之间，仅补缴之税款即增加一倍。而税务机关尚未查获因而被偷漏之国税，其数目还相当巨大。例如沈阳市去年三月举行的全市调查，证明全市已缴所得税额平均仅占应缴数的百分之五十二，也就是说偷漏数约占一半。沈阳市还有一些大户，以大压小，将捐献款项和税款，大部分摊给小户，而自己虽然高唱抗美援朝，高唱踊跃缴税，但却捐得很少，缴得很少。又如沈阳市代理店业理事长王香五，从一九五○年至一九五一年，个人偷税即达八十一亿五千余万元。请注意，以上的这些统计，还是反盗窃运动以前的材料，如果把反盗窃运动中所揭发检举的材料整理出来，一定更为惊人。这难道还不足以说明资产阶级的进攻是极为严重的吗？
    最后，当反盗窃运动广泛展开了，群众纷纷进行检举，并要求违法的资产阶级分子彻底坦白时，而资产阶级分子在运动中所采取的抵赖行为，同样表现了他们的行动是有组织的。首先，他们一致的希望是想继续隐瞒其犯罪行为，纷纷和贪污分子订立“攻守同盟”，有所谓：“掉头也不谈，各守据点，谁也不准讲谁，攻破谁算谁。”其后，看到运动一天天深入，继续隐瞒已不可能了，于是又企图少讲一点，混过“关”去，他们就替贪污分子出谋计策，提出五条防线。可是当群众已经发动，斗争火力旺盛，五道“防线”已不能自保，贪污分子或同谋犯已开始动摇，某些大贪污犯或大盗窃犯，又迅即装出一付凶恶面孔，到处去吓唬人，他们说道：“我干过反革命，你是知道的，如果你要谈出咱们的事，我即咬你一口，就说你过去和我一起干过反革命。”而最后，当恐吓仍然无济于事，贪污分子和盗窃犯们眼看着自己已注定了逃不出人民法网时，他们就眨着眼睛，挤出一滴滴的眼泪来。前几天，沈阳市某些违法商人，突然都采用了这一战术，他们和工作组谈话时，都痛哭流涕，承认有罪。可是，我们必须认清，这些资产阶级分子今天只是开始低头认罪了，但他们是否能真正彻底坦白呢？这个结论，尚须等待事实的证明。
    有计划、有组织的犯罪活动
    资产阶级猖狂进攻表现为一种有计划有组织的犯罪活动。其中某些集团，并有自己的“纪律”。以下，我们只列举几个例子来说明它：
    一、赵百川案。以奸商赵百川为首的盗窃集团，专门以偷盗国家机关X光、整流管、萤光板等贵重器材为业，他们曾分别钻进东北邮电总局医务所、中国医科大学附属医院、东北工人医院等机关。这个集团有定期会议：每星期计划一次如何进行盗窃活动；有自己的专业“干部”，由赵百川负责调遣，在一处偷了就被派到另一处去偷；还有严格的密约：“凡是参与其事者一概不准泄露秘密，如有泄露者，即由赵百川下手处死无论。”
    二、关鸣九案。关鸣九是沈阳裕兴源油房经理，他勾结同业，互相串通，给国家加工豆油时，有计划地集体地抬高成本、压低出油率。三年来，仅抬高成本一项即盗窃了国家资财十五亿元；压低出油率，使国家每月损失三万斤豆油。
    三、谷崇熙案。谷崇熙是上海的一个商人，钻入沈阳油漆工厂，有计划地盗窃了制造油墨的各种技术秘密，然后先把家属送回上海，自己再请长假，企图到上海去自己开设工厂。
    当然，这还只是几个已被揭露和曾经公开发布过的例子。除此而外，在前面我们所曾列举过的一些例子中，像这样有计划有组织的行动，同样很多。这些事实难道不是已令人万难容忍的吗？
    奢侈淫逸的生活
    资产阶级大量地、有计划有组织地盗窃了国家宝贵的财富以后，就在这些罪行的基础上，建筑了自己奢侈淫逸的生活方式，又用这种腐化堕落的生活方式，继续影响和引诱国家工作人员，并破坏新社会的风气。
    沈阳市铁店业者中流行的一句话：“二至八月生意多，十冬腊月吃喝嫖。”把这句“行”话翻译出来，那就是：二月至八月，国家修建工作极为紧张，这些不法资本家乘机投机，大量诈骗和盗窃国家财富。一到冬天，“生意”稍闲，就恣意挥霍。
    虽然肚皮的容量有限，但是资产阶级吃喝的耗费仍然惊人：沈阳市太原街附近有一家“高等饭店”，买卖全部被几家铁店包了，这些违法资本家，每餐饭动辄价值百万元，折成高粱米一千三百五十斤，够一千三百余人吃一天的。其中义成和号经理，一天可以连吃四餐。另一个天华店经理，同样奢侈淫逸，他的店员说他是“天天有酒夜夜嫖”，这是一点也不夸张的形容。
    除了吃喝而外，就是玩弄女人。把妇女当作玩物，也正是资产阶级思想形态的特点之一。沈阳和平区五十七家铁店，就有二十一家的经理有小老婆，其中一个叫陈玉清的，三年中就违法换了三十个老婆。为了玩弄女人，他们的挥霍还要比吃喝多得多。一个叫吴佩的奸商，为了一个女人，一九五○年一年内所花费的“经常费”为二亿二千万元，买一所房子，又花一亿八千万元。抚顺市奸商李国仁有一个半公开的小老婆，每月开支三千万人民币，而李国仁还说她“为啥这样节省呢”？而三千万元说明一个什么数字呢？它等于一百个中等工人的月薪。
    再看看他们的家庭生活：抚顺一个叫林星五的违法商人，每天平均生活费是一百万元，他的一个小老婆，专门有三个用人侍候，他小孩一天所花的玩具钱，要顶一个技工干一个月。
    这就是说：资产阶级违法分子，一方面盗窃了国家为经济建设所积累的资金，妨碍了国家的建设事业；另一方面，则穷侈极欲地过着腐化堕落的生活，破坏新社会的秩序。这些大盗窃犯，都是国家建设的敌人，是人民中的寄生虫。如果不把他们这种腐化堕落的污毒清除干净，国家和人民的前途，还堪设想吗！
    （五）驳资产阶级的几种谬论是不是进攻？
    有的资产阶级代言人说：“我们既没有军队，又没有武器，也没有号召大家反对工人阶级、反对共产党、反对人民政府、反对人民解放军，这怎么能叫作进攻？”他们这种说法的目的，是企图否认开展反贪污和反盗窃运动以打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻的伟大革命意义，并为其继续进攻散布烟幕。
    是的，资产阶级的进攻是没有武器和军队的，但他们之所以没有武器和军队，乃是由于中国人民革命的胜利，由于人民民主专政的强大和巩固，使他们不能也不敢这样做。可是这并不等于说资产阶级因而就没有举行进攻。因为没有武器和军队同样也可以举行进攻。例如说，在共同纲领上已明确规定了资产阶级是被领导的阶级，资本主义经济应该在国营经济领导下发展，这些也都是资产阶级的代表们在人民政治协商会议上举手通过了的国家大法，可是今天资产阶级却不愿服从无产阶级的领导，而要篡夺无产阶级的领导权；资产阶级不愿使他们的经营在国营经济领导下发展，而千方百计削弱和破坏国营经济，他们这种违反共同纲领、并向无产阶级和国营经济开火的行为，难道还不是进攻吗？
    如果资产阶级的先生们硬要说没有进攻，那么，我们再反问他们一句：你们大量行贿、偷税漏税、偷工减料、盗窃国家资财、盗窃国家经济情报的罪行，究竟应该作何解释呢？你们把国家工作人员拉入贪污的泥淖、把自己的奸细派到国家机关中当
    “坐探”的罪行又作何解释呢？你们腐蚀了某些国家机关，甚至公开篡夺某些单位的领导的罪行又作何解释呢？你们的种种罪行，已严重地危害了国家与人民的利益，今天，全国人民一致奋起，制裁你们的罪行、打退你们的进攻，难道还不是天经地义有的放矢的吗？
    是不是阶级的进攻？
    也有人说：“奸商违法乱纪，但是商人不等于整个资产阶级，因而反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对偷窃国家资财、反对偷工减料、反对盗窃国家经济情报的斗争，怎么能说是反对资产阶级的进攻呢？”这种说法，是企图把资产阶级的猖狂进攻，说成只是少数奸商的犯法行为，言外之意，就是说“打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻”，乃是无的放矢，至少也是夸大其词的说法。
    这种诡辩，是完全抹杀了事实的。上面很多材料，已经最雄辩地把它驳倒了。今天资产阶级的猖狂进攻，不仅表现在数量上是占大多数，而且在性质上也正是表现着资产阶级本身的特点。因为中国资产阶级同世界各国的资产阶级一样，具有唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的本质，上述资产阶级违法乱纪的许多行为，正是资产阶级本质的表现。因此，任何人如果为资产阶级的诡辩所骗而忽视了问题的根本性质，而不去彻底进行反贪污和反盗窃的斗争，就会犯大错误，对于我们的国家和人民来说，就是后患无穷。
    是不是有组织的进攻？
    还有人说：“私人资本家生活都很散漫，他们没有固定的联系，怎么能说他们的进攻是有组织的？”这种说法，其实质是企图把资产阶级的各种罪行，说成是偶然的无关紧要的现象。
    是的，资产阶级今天还没有一个统一的组织，和统一的最高司令部来公开地指挥他们所举行的进攻。其所以如此，乃是因为在人民民主革命已经胜利，工人阶级在全国范围内的领导权已经确立的今天，中国民族资产阶级不可能公开地、明目张胆地、有组织有领导地、在全国范围内和全体规模上和工人阶级争夺领导权。
    可是，这并不等于说资产阶级的进攻就是没有组织的。如本文前面所举的赵百川盗窃集团，他们有定期的会议，有周密的计划，有专业的干部，有严密的纪律；难道这还不是有组织的吗？资产阶级在全东北、在全国毫无例外的猖狂进攻，并且有组织地在许多部门、许多企业、许多地区中和工人阶级争夺领导权，只不过所采取的方式比较隐蔽而已。我们必须认清，资产阶级这种恶毒的进攻，对国家和人民的危害，是极为严重的。那些认为资产阶级的进攻是无组织的说法，乃是蒙蔽我们的眼睛、涣散我们警惕的胡说，必须予以坚决的驳斥！
    反盗窃斗争是消灭资产阶级吗？
    还有一些资产阶级分子，他们四处传播着一些极端恶毒的谣言：“反盗窃运动就等于城市里的土改一样”，“这是变相没收私人产业，消灭资产阶级”，“各民主党派成立联合政府，现在又要把资产阶级踢出门外”……这种说法，事实上是造谣惑众、破坏人民反盗窃斗争的行为。
    谁都知道：资产阶级在中国新民主主义社会中，是有其一定的政治地位和经济地位的，在共同纲领中也已有明确规定，今天仍没有一点改变。反盗窃斗争，业已三令五申，只是反对资产阶级行贿、偷税漏税、偷工减料、盗窃国家资财、盗窃国家经济情报等破坏共同纲领的犯罪行为，是要他们规规矩矩，遵行共同纲领，服从工人阶级的领导，并不是要消灭资产阶级的存在。显然的，这一斗争是和农村土地改革根本不同的。在土地改革中，地主阶级要被消灭，地主阶级的土地、耕畜、农具、多余的粮食及其在农村中多余的房屋要全部没收，然后再分给他们一份。而反盗窃斗争，对于城市资本家的合法财产，政府仍然加以保护，要把反盗窃斗争说成和土地改革一样，岂不是最恶毒的诬蔑吗？
    在资产阶级中展开反盗窃斗争，不仅是为了保障无产阶级在新中国的领导权和人民民主统一战线的继续巩固，保障国家国防建设和经济建设的继续提高和发展，保障人民经济生活的继续安定，而且也是为了保护正当的工商业者。沈阳市某些正当工商业者反映：“这次反得太好了，不然，像我们这样的小买卖，都得叫大奸商弄垮。”这是最好的证明。那些资产阶级的违法分子，他们自己做了严重的违法行为，又不低头认罪，反而制造谰言，诽谤反盗窃运动是为了“消灭资产阶级”，企图以此动摇人心，制造混乱局面，掩蔽其滔天罪行，这种反动论调，正是说明资产阶级的猖狂进攻至今还是没有被完全打退的一个例证。
        ×    ×    ×
    因此，我们全体人民必须再接再厉穷追猛打，务必把所有大贪污犯和大盗窃犯全数捕获，争取反贪污和反盗窃斗争的彻底胜利！
