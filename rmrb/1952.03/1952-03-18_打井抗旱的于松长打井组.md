Yu Songchang, an agricultural labor model from Xinan Tai Village in Wendeng County, Shandong Province, is a farmer who firmly believes that "man can conquer nature." The mutual aid team he leads has successively overcome the threat of two droughts by digging wells to fight drought, and achieved bumper harvests in both last year and the year before.

After the wheat harvest in 1949, a severe drought occurred in the area of ​​Yu Songchang's hometown, Xinan Tai Village, Wendeng County. It was the time when the crops were heading, but it hadn't rained for fifty-eight days, and the corn and peanuts all withered. Yu Songchang remembers this incident very well. In the spring of 1950, the Wendeng County People's Government called on farmers to dig wells to fight drought. Yu Songchang immediately responded to this call and joined four other families, including Yu Qinghua, in the village to form a well-digging mutual aid team. That spring, they dug a well and borrowed a waterwheel from the People's Government. After the wheat harvest, Xinan Tai Village suffered another severe drought. The farmers in the village could only carry water to sow seeds, and the sowing was not timely; Yu Songchang's mutual aid team had well water to irrigate the land, and the corn, beans, and rice were all sown in time. In the autumn harvest, Yu Songchang's well-digging team harvested eighty more catties of grain per mu than other farmers.

In the autumn of 1950, Yu Songchang publicized the fact that he had achieved a bumper harvest by digging wells. He said, "Farmers have to rely on labor, not on the heavens. Dig a well, borrow a waterwheel, and ten mu of land will not be afraid of drought." In this way, the farmers in Xinan Tai Village organized themselves and borrowed thirteen waterwheels from the People's Government to prepare to dig wells. However, the land on the south side of the village, where they planned to dig wells, was a high slope with hard soil, making it difficult to dig. Yu Songchang then partnered with Yu Hao to dig first on the high slope. When they dug two zhang deep, they encountered hard stones, and more than a dozen hoes were worn down to stumps, and there was not a drop of water in the well. At this time, the elders in the village began to discuss: "This piece of land has no 'Dragon King'; even if you dig ten zhang deep, there will be no water." Hearing this, Yu Hao became discouraged and unwilling to dig anymore. Yu Songchang said, "In order to encourage everyone to dig wells to prevent drought, we cannot stop halfway and fill it in. We are optimistic that this land will definitely have water and we will definitely be able to dig a well." Sure enough, when they dug to a depth of two zhang and four chi, spring water gushed out. Under the promotion of Yu Songchang, Xinan Tai Village dug a total of sixteen wells that year, thus avoiding the threat of drought after the wheat harvest last year.

Last year, Yu Songchang's well-digging team had eleven people. They helped farmers in the mountainous area of Gu, the Caomiao district, and the Fenglin district of this county organize themselves to dig many wells. The Yangjia Tuan Village in Caomiao district had a sandy land that was difficult to dig wells on, because they could not dig a wellbore, and the sand would fill it up as soon as they dug. After research, Yu Songchang's well-digging team proved that there was water in the local area, so they helped the farmers in Yangjia Tuan Village come up with many ways to dig wells. Finally, they used wood to make well rings to block the upper layer of sand, so that the sand outside the ring could not fill the dug wellbore; in addition, they also used the method of building a wellbore with stones as they dug, and finally dug a well in the sandy land. Last year alone, Yu Songchang's well-digging team painstakingly helped and promoted the farmers in nearby villages to dig more than one hundred wells, freeing nearly a thousand mu of farmland from the threat of drought and increasing grain production by an average of more than fifty catties per mu.

Yu Songchang's mutual aid team is a banner for well-digging and drought resistance in the Jiaodong area of ​​Shandong Province. This year, Yu Songchang's mutual aid team responded to the call for drought prevention, determined to irrigate all the cultivated land of the group, strive to increase grain production by 8,910 catties, and actively promote their experience in well-digging and drought resistance.

    打井抗旱的于松长打井组
    新华社记者　朱光灿
    山东省文登县西南台村的农业劳动模范于松长，是一个坚信“人定胜天”的农民。他所领导的互助组用打井抗旱的办法接连战胜了两次旱灾的威胁，去年和前年都得到了丰收。
    一九四九年麦收后，于松长的家乡文登县西南台村一带，发生了一次大旱。正是五谷抽穗的时候，有五十八天没有下雨，苞米、花生都旱死了。于松长对这件事记得非常深刻。一九五○年春天，文登县人民政府号召农民打井抗旱。于松长便立即响应这个号召，联合村里的于清华等四家组成了一个打井互助组。那年春天他们便打成了一眼井，并向人民政府贷来了一架水车。麦收过后，西南台村又逢大旱，村子里的农民只能挑水播种，都种得不及时；于松长互助组有井水浇地，苞米、豆子和水稻都种得及时。秋收时，于松长打井组比其他的农户每亩多收了八十斤粮食。
    一九五○年秋天，于松长便把自己打井丰收的事实到处宣传。他说：“种田人要靠劳动，靠天不成。打一眼井、贷一部水车，十亩地就不怕旱了。”这样，西南台村的农民便组织起来向人民政府贷来了十三部水车，准备打井。但是准备打井的村南面的一块地是高坡地，土质坚硬、很难打。于松长便又和于好合伙在高坡上先打。他们挖到两丈深的地方就碰到了坚硬的石头，十几把镢头都刨成了光秃秃的，井里一滴水也没有。这时，村里的老人们又议论开了：“这块地没有‘龙王爷’，打十丈深也不会有水的。”听了这个话，于好便泄了气，不愿再打。于松长说：“我们为了推动大家打井防旱，不能打一半又填死。而这块地看好了一定有水，一定能够打成井的。”果然，他们挖到两丈四尺深的地方，泉水便涌出来了。在于松长的推动下，这一年西南台村共打了十六眼井，因而摆脱了去年麦收后天旱的威胁。
    去年，于松长领导的打井组已有十一个人，他们帮助本县的崮山区、草庙区和凤林区的农民组织起来打了许多井。草庙区杨家疃村有块沙地不好打井，因为挖不成井筒，一挖沙又填起来了。于松长打井组经研究证明当地有水，便帮助杨家疃村农民想了许多打井的办法。最后，他们用木头做成井圈拦住上层的沙，这样圈外的沙便不能向挖成的井筒里填了；另外，他们还用随挖随用石头修井筒的办法，终于在沙地上把井打成了。去年一年，于松长打井组就这样不辞辛劳地帮助和推动附近村庄农民打了一百多眼井，使近千亩的农田解除了天旱的威胁，平均每亩增产了五十多斤粮食。
    于松长互助组是山东省胶东地区打井抗旱的一面旗帜。今年，于松长互助组响应防旱的号召，决心使本组的全部耕地都得到浇灌，争取增产粮食八千九百一十斤，并积极推广他们的打井抗旱经验。
