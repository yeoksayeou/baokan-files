    As usual, collective farms throughout the Soviet Union held report and election meetings in January and February this year to summarize last year's achievements, discuss this year's plans, and re-elect leading bodies. The superiority of the collective farm system and large-scale production has been clearly demonstrated in these summaries and plans.

    In the Liebknicht District of Stavropol Krai, there is a Chaiboyev Collective Farm, which was formed by the merger of four smaller collective farms. This collective farm has only been merged for over a year, but due to the strengthening of its economic power, new features have appeared in its life: electrification. Last year, eight of its ten threshing grounds were electrified. More than 8 million kilograms (each kilogram equals two market catties) of commodity grain and grain for seeds were threshed using electricity, saving more than 4,000 workdays. Electricity is used for grinding corn, preparing feed, milking cows, ramming hemp, making bricks, and blacksmithing. There are now a total of 30 generators working in various departments of the collective farm. Almost every collective farmer's household has electric lights and radio receivers, and electric stoves and irons are widely used.
    This expanded collective farm has been able to make better use of advanced technology and exert higher cultivation capabilities. Its main grain harvests all exceeded the plan last year. On 2,835 hectares (each hectare equals fifteen market mu) of land sown with winter wheat, 2,030 kilograms were harvested per hectare; on 512 hectares of land sown with sunflowers, 1,400 kilograms were harvested per hectare; and on 534 hectares of land sown with corn, 2,610 kilograms of shelled corn were harvested per hectare. This year, the collective farm will complete the afforestation plan scheduled to be completed within fifteen years.
    The Chaiboyev Collective Farm has its own vineyards, orchards, and vegetable gardens. In one year, it established a brick factory with an annual output of one million bricks, and built sheepfolds and stables, cowsheds, and pigsties that can accommodate a thousand sheep; these buildings are all covered with brick and tile.
    The public accumulation fund of the Chaiboyev Collective Farm has increased greatly last year. It now has a public accumulation fund of 5 million rubles. This is a solid resource for the collective farm to move forward.

    The "Communist International" Collective Farm in the Morshansk District of Tambov Oblast was formed a year and a half ago by the merger of three collective farms. This merged collective farm is better able to organize labor, use machinery, and adopt scientific methods. It has two agronomists, one animal husbandry specialist, and one veterinarian. Its land has implemented a grass-arable rotation system, is well cultivated and fertilized, and is sown with improved seeds. The farm's sowing and harvesting processes have been accelerated. Although the weather was not good last year (there was a slight drought during spring sowing, dry winds blew when the grains were filling, and it rained during harvesting), the grain harvest was still very good, with 620 kilograms more harvested per hectare than the previous year. The average grain harvest was 1,730 kilograms per hectare, with winter wheat yielding more than 2,300 kilograms per hectare. The labor spent on every 100 kilograms of grain last year was reduced by 25 percent compared to before the merger. This collective farm has dairy farms, sheep farms, pig farms, poultry farms, and thoroughbred horse farms.
    The total income of the "Communist International" Collective Farm has increased from 587,000 rubles the previous year to 1,158,000 rubles last year. The remuneration for labor days has also increased. Last year, the remuneration for each labor day was: three kilograms of grain, 2.8 kilograms of potatoes and vegetables, plus six rubles. The Zaitsev family, collective farmers, received a total of 5,242 kilograms of grain, 3,440 kilograms of potatoes, 1,147 kilograms of vegetables, and 10,600 rubles for their labor days last year. There are quite a few such households. Each collective farmer received an average of 350 labor day remunerations, and some received 700 to 800 labor day remunerations.
    The cultural needs of collective farmers have grown. Every household has radio receivers, newspapers, magazines, and books. In addition to Party members, non-Party members also study the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Many collective farmers have entered agronomy and animal husbandry technical training classes. A young man named Yaltchakov said at the report and election meeting that the people of the collective farm had grown taller in the past year, "We have now reached a new peak, and from here we can see our surroundings more clearly."

    The expanded collective farms, due to the strengthening of economic power and manpower, are not only able to rapidly develop agriculture, but also to smoothly carry out cultural facilities and civil engineering construction. There are a total of 27 collective farms in the Mieritopol District of Ukraine. Their income has increased greatly last year (24 of them have become "millionaire" collective farms), and each collective farm has a library. There are 1,880 male and female collective farmers in the district studying in three-year agronomy and animal husbandry technical training classes, and 958 specialized personnel will be trained this year. All the collective farms in the Moskalensky District of Omsk Oblast built a total of six brick factories, sixty-six livestock houses and other public buildings last year. Among them, the Kalinin Collective Farm built a brick factory with an annual output of 200,000 bricks, and built pigsties that can accommodate 130 pigs, sheepfolds for 350 sheep, poultry houses for 2,500 poultry, a drying yard, and a broadcasting station with 350 speakers.
    The activities of combining agricultural science and agricultural production are being carried out more effectively in the expanded collective farms. The "Warrior" Collective Farm in the Bronnitsky District of Moscow Oblast has an "Agronomy House." It has only three staff members: an agronomist, a seed cultivator, and a laboratory technician, but it is supported by all the collective farmers. In addition to testing grains and soil in the laboratory, all its experimental work is carried out in the fields by production teams. For example, last autumn, it sowed two or three kilograms of mustard per hectare on 135 hectares of land sown with winter wheat. By the time it snowed, the mustard had grown about half a meter high, and it accumulated twice as much snow as usual, which was very beneficial to winter wheat. The "Agronomy House" often obtains several centimeters of new seeds from various agricultural research institutions, cultivates them, and not only provides enough for its own use, but also supplies them to other collective farms. Anything that the "Agronomy House" successfully experiments with is reported to the collective farm management department, and after discussion by the production team and approval by the management department, it is immediately popularized throughout the collective farm. For example, in 1950, three types of potatoes were experimented with on 17 hectares of land using the square-cluster planting method, and the results were very good. In 1951, this method was used to plant potatoes on about 300 hectares of land. The Lenin Collective Farm in the Lenin District of Moscow Oblast, in order to meet people's demands for improving knowledge, strengthened the activities of lecture meetings. The number of volunteer lecturers has increased from the original 13 to the current 30. In addition to the teachers, doctors, agronomists, and animal husbandry specialists of the farm, advanced collective farmers of the farm are also invited to give lectures. When there are questions that cannot be answered by their own strength, outside experts are also invited to help. Lectures are held in the club, and in the fields during the busy farming season. Last year, the farm established a "Production Team Day" system: each production team holds work summary and planning meetings every weekend. Lecture meetings are also held on this occasion, with lectures tailored to the specific needs of each production team. A total of 200 lectures were given last year. The topics of the lectures are determined according to the needs of the audience and the season, in addition to general political and scientific knowledge. For example, before spring plowing, lectures were given on "Correctly Plowing the Land is the Foundation of a Good Harvest," "Fertilizers and Their Use," and "How to Increase Yields."
    Like many collective farms, the farmers of the Stalin Collective Farm in the Budyonny District of Voronezh Oblast, according to the tasks prescribed by the state, formulated a production plan for 1952 in February.
    The Stalin Collective Farm has 6,882 hectares of land, of which 4,120 hectares are cultivated land. Its output of grain and milk increased by more than 50 percent last year compared to the previous year, its public accumulation fund increased by 586,000 rubles, it built 12 production buildings, and it added electric milking machines. The main task given to it by the state this year is to increase the yield of crops. This year, it will increase its grain yield by more than 34 percent compared to last year. This is guaranteed by better organization of labor and better use of advanced agronomy. First, better use of tractors and better plowing of the land. With the cooperation of fixed tractor teams, 85 percent of the collective farm's winter crops have been sown on fallow land, and 90 percent of this year's spring crops will be sown on land plowed last autumn. Second, establish a system of responsibility for production teams. Each production team is responsible for a certain area of cultivated land. Production teams of 55 to 60 people take care of 60 to 76 hectares of cultivated land. The tasks to be completed by each production team are stipulated according to different conditions. Third, pay attention to popularizing scientific achievements and the experiences of advanced workers. For example, when adopting a rotation system, the order of sowing crops is determined based on the impact on the harvest. All cultivated land will be sown with improved seeds suitable for local conditions. The winter wheat crops on 200 hectares of land that have already been sown are using a grid-shaped sowing method, which has a higher yield than row sowing.
    This is how the Soviet collective farms are being consolidated and are advancing.

     前进中的苏联大集体农场
     新华社驻莫斯科记者李何
    今年一、二月间，苏联各地的集体农场照例都举行了报告和选举会议，来总结去年成绩，讨论今年计划和改选领导机构。集体农场制度和大生产的优越性，已在这些总结和计划中鲜明地表现出来。
    ×××
    斯塔夫罗波尔州李卜克内西区，有一个柴伯耶夫集体农场，是由四个小的集体农场合并成的。这个集体农场合并不过一年多，但由于经济力量的加强，它的生活中出现了新的气象：电气化。去年，它的十个打谷场中有八个电气化了。用电力打了八百多万公斤（每公斤合二市斤）的商品谷物和做种籽用的谷物，因而节约了四千多个劳动日。磨玉米、预备饲料、挤牛奶、搥麻、造砖、打铁等都用电力。集体农场的各个部门现在共有三十部发电机在工作着。集体农民差不多家家都装有电灯和无线电收音器，而且广泛地使用着电炉和电熨斗。
    这个扩大后的集体农场，已能够更好地使用先进技术，更高地发挥耕作能力。它的主要谷物的收获量去年都超过了计划。在种冬麦的二千八百三十五公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）的土地上，每公顷收了二千零三十公斤；种向日葵的五百十二公顷土地上，每公顷收了一千四百公斤；种玉蜀黍的五百三十四公顷土地上，每公顷收了二千六百一十公斤去棒后的玉米。今年集体农场将完成预定在十五年内完成的造林计划。
    柴伯耶夫集体农场有自己的葡萄园、果园和菜园。它在一年中建立了年产百万块砖的造砖厂，建筑了容纳千只绵羊的羊圈和马厩、牛栏、猪圈；这些建筑物都是砖瓦盖的。
    柴伯耶夫集体农场的公积金去年已大大增加了。它现在拥有公积金五百万卢布。这是集体农场向前发展的雄厚资力。
        ×××
    坦波夫州摩尔山斯基区的“共产国际”集体农场，是一年半前由三个集体农场合并的。这个合并后的集体农场能够更好地组织劳动，使用机器和采用科学方法。它拥有两个农艺师、一个养畜师、一个兽医。它的土地施行了牧草轮种制，很好地耕作和施肥，播种了优良种籽。农场的播种和收割等农作过程已经加快了。虽然去年气候不好（春播时有点旱，谷物满浆时刮旱风，收割时下雨），但是，谷物的收成依然很好，每公顷地比前年多收了六百二十公斤。谷物收获量平均每公顷收了一千七百三十公斤，其中冬麦每公顷收了二千三百公斤以上。去年在每一百公斤谷物上所花的劳动，比起合并前减低了百分之二十五。这个集体农场有乳牛场、养羊场、养猪场、家禽场和良种走马场。
    “共产国际”集体农场总收入，已从前年的五十八万七千卢布提高到去年的一百十五万八千卢布。劳动日的报酬也提高了。去年每个劳动日的报酬是：三公斤粮食、二·八公斤洋芋和蔬菜，外加六个卢布。集体农民查伊茨一家去年所得的劳动日报酬共五千二百四十二公斤谷物、三千四百四十公斤洋芋、一千一百四十七公斤蔬菜，和一万零六百卢布。这样的农户为数并不少。每个集体农民平均得到三百五十个劳动日报酬，也有得到七、八百个劳动日的报酬。
    集体农民的文化需要增长了。家家户户都有无线电收音器、报纸、杂志、书籍。除党员以外，非党员也学习联共党史。许多集体农民进了农艺和养畜技术训练班。有一个叫做亚尔柴科夫的青年在报告和选举会议上说，集体农场的人们过去一年中长了一个头，“我们现在登上了新高峰，从这里来看周围更清楚了。”
        ×××
    扩大后的集体农场，由于经济力量和人力的加强，不但能够迅速地发展农业，而且能够顺利地兴办文化设施和土木建筑。乌克兰米耶里托波尔区一共有二十七个集体农场，它们去年的收入都大大增加（其中二十四个集体农场已成为“百万”集体农场），每个集体农场都设有图书馆。全区有一千八百八十个男女集体农民在三年制农艺和养畜技术训练班学习，今年将培养出九百五十八个专门人材。鄂木斯克州莫斯卡连斯克区所有的集体农场，去年共建立了六座造砖厂，六十六座养畜房及其他公共建筑物。其中，加里宁集体农场建立了年产二十万块砖的造砖厂，建筑了能容纳一百三十条猪的猪圈、三百五十只羊的羊圈、二千五百只家禽的禽舍，晒谷场、和有三百五十个播音器的广播站。
    农业科学和农业生产结合的活动，在扩大后的集体农场中更有效地进行着。莫斯科州布罗尼茨基区
    “战士”集体农场有一个“农艺之家”。它只有三个工作人员：农艺师、种籽培养员和化验员，但它受到全体集体农民的支持。除了在化验室化验谷物和土壤之外，它所有的实验工作都是经过生产队在田间进行的。例如，它去年秋天在种冬麦的一百三十五公顷土地上，每公顷同时种两三公斤芥子。到下雪前，芥子已长约半公尺高，它所积的雪比平常多一倍，对冬麦非常有利。“农艺之家”常常从各农业研究机关取得几公分的新种籽，加以培育，不仅自己够用，还能供给别的集体农场。凡是“农艺之家”实验成功的东西，向集体农场管理部作报告，经过生产队讨论和管理部批准之后，立即普及到全集体农场去。例如，一九五零年在十七公顷土地上用方形窝种法实验了三种洋芋，成绩很好，一九五一年就用这种方法窝种了约三百公顷土地的洋芋。莫斯科州列宁区列宁集体农场，为了适应人们对于提高知识的要求，加强了演讲会的活动。义务演讲员从原来的十三个人增加到现在的三十个人。除了本农场的教员、医生、农艺师、养畜师之外，还聘请了本农场的先进集体农民作演讲。遇有自己力量不能够回答的问题，也请外面的专家来帮助。演讲在俱乐部进行，农忙的时候在田间进行。去年农场建立了“生产队日”制度：每周周末各生产队举行工作总结和计划会议。演讲会也抓住这种场合举行，针对各生产队的具体需要作演讲。去年共作了二百次演讲。讲题除了一般政治和科学知识以外，根据对象和季节的需要来决定。例如，在春耕前，进行了“正确地耕地是丰收的基础”、“肥料及其使用”、“怎样提高收获量”等等演讲。
    像许许多多集体农场一样，佛罗内兹州布琼尼区斯大林集体农场农民，根据国家所规定的任务，在二月间订出了一九五二年生产计划。
    斯大林集体农场有六千八百八十二公顷土地，其中耕地占四千一百二十公顷。它去年谷物和牛乳的产量比前年增加了百分之五十以上，公积金增加了五十八万六千卢布，盖了十二座生产建筑物，添置了电气挤乳机。今年国家给它的主要任务是提高农作物的收获量。它今年要把谷物收获量比去年提高百分之三十四以上。这是靠更好地组织劳动和更好地使用先进农艺来保证的。第一，更好地使用拖拉机，更好地耕地。在固定的拖拉机队的合作下，这个集体农场百分之八十五的冬季作物已种在休耕地上，今年有百分之九十的春季作物将种在去年秋耕过的地上。第二，建立生产队的负责制。每个生产队负责一定的耕地。五十五到六十人的生产队照管着六十到七十六公顷的耕地。根据不同的条件，规定各生产队应完成的任务。第三，注意普及科学成就和先进工作者的经验。例如，采用轮种制时，根据对收获量的影响确定播种作物先后次序。所有耕地都将播种适宜当地条件的优良种籽。已种的二百公顷土地的冬麦作物，是采用比行列播种法收获量为高的格子形播种法。
    苏联大集体农场就是这样巩固着、前进着。
