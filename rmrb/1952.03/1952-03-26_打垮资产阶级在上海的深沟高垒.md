    Smash the Bourgeoisie's Deep Trenches and High Fortifications in Shanghai
    Wang Yunsheng
    The great struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and theft of state economic intelligence has achieved basic victory throughout the country, but in Shanghai it has only just begun. The "Five-Anti" movement started relatively late in Shanghai, which, of course, has its inevitable reasons, but it also caused some unnecessary psychological effects. These psychological effects are mainly two: (1) People outside Shanghai think that Shanghai, a place where the bourgeoisie is concentrated, will be over in just a few days, so they secretly sigh, "The capitalists in Shanghai still have ways!" (2) Illegal manufacturers in Shanghai think that it really is "just a passing breeze," and even secretly laugh, "The government still can't do without our industrial and commercial circles!" In fact, both of these are misunderstandings. The "Five-Anti" struggle in Shanghai has only officially started today. It must be carried out seriously, unfolded on a large scale and systematically, to strive for a complete victory. We will never withdraw until we achieve complete victory!

    Shanghai is the Main Base of the Chinese Bourgeoisie

    For three years, the bourgeoisie has launched such rampant attacks on the working class, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Government, causing such significant damage to the country and the people. Today, our working class is launching a counterattack against the bourgeoisie to completely repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks. Shanghai is the main battleground of this fierce struggle. Achieving a complete victory in Shanghai's "Five-Anti" struggle means that the national struggle has achieved complete victory. Without the victory in the Shanghai battlefield, this great "Five-Anti" movement cannot be considered a complete victory.

    Shanghai is the main base of the Chinese bourgeoisie. Shanghai has a urban population of over five million, and Shanghai has hundreds of thousands of industrial and commercial households, accounting for an absolute proportion of private industry and commerce in the country. The Shanghai bourgeoisie is the most typical, the most representative, and also the most insidious, cunning, and experienced in the country. Old China was semi-feudal and semi-colonial, and the Chinese bourgeoisie was formed in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial economy. Shanghai is the core, so the Shanghai bourgeoisie is particularly characterized by compradorism and rascality. Shanghai produced Fu Xiao'an, the big comprador and big businessman who served imperialism and colluded with the Northern Warlords; Yu Qiaqing, who exploited the exorbitant profits of the foreign concessions and bred the bureaucratic capital group of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang; Du Yuesheng, the gangster boss and big capitalist; and Huang Chujiu, who started from scratch using "pidgin English" scams. Today, Wang Kangnian, a purely fraudulent and speculative character who has lost all conscience, has emerged. This series of typical Shanghai capitalists not only seek profit, harm others for their own benefit, and engage in speculation, but they also have the comprador ability to collude with imperialism, betray national interests, and act as evil slaves in the foreign concessions. They are also good at wrangling in court and licking blood from knife edges, displaying a rascal style. The bourgeoisie in Shanghai is indeed difficult to fight and very difficult to deal with. Because they have this tradition and are good at this style, Wang Kangnian, Zhang Xingen, and Xu Miaoxin dared to harm our People's Volunteers with fake medicines and rotten meat, so Li Hanmin dared to cut corners to damage the Huai River project, a great construction of the motherland, and so Zhao Jinfeng dared to use fake palm ropes to damage machines and endanger our People's Liberation Army. Such heinous crimes have universally aroused the anger of the people across the country, but for the Shanghai奸商, who have a comprador and rascal nature, it is precisely their excellent and competent "specialty."

    Since liberation, Shanghai should have been transformed, but the Shanghai bourgeoisie has not been greatly transformed. Some capitalists who fled were truly counter-revolutionaries who could not be separated from imperialism and the four major families of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Those who stayed have all been taken care of by the People's Government. They have political status, with representatives in the CPPCC, government committees, people's representative conferences, and consultative committees, and are one of the masters of the people's power. They also benefit economically. When in difficulty, the People's Government provides various kinds of care, processing orders, and adjusting public-private relations, so that Shanghai's industry and commerce are revived, and when the economy improves, they make a lot of money. 1951 was a year of great wealth for Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles. The surplus on the books alone was several trillion RMB. If you add tax evasion, theft, and all kinds of evil deeds, it may be another several trillion. Both promotion and wealth, and rampant attacks. Since liberation, the Shanghai bourgeoisie has been very impressive and still "gets away with things." They are lively and eloquent everywhere, striving to "gain the upper hand" in public and vying for leadership in practice. The Shanghai bourgeoisie once demanded that the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce be located in Shanghai, as if Shanghai were the "economic capital" of the country. The thoughts they unintentionally revealed were so arrogant.

    Shanghai is the main base of the Chinese bourgeoisie, and the deep trenches and high fortifications of the Chinese bourgeoisie are set up in Shanghai. How can our working class lightly let go of the Shanghai bourgeoisie in our counterattack against the bourgeoisie? To strive for the complete victory of the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence, how can we leave out the major target of illegal manufacturers in Shanghai? The good news of the "Five-Anti" battle has been flying in from major cities across the country. Those are the victories on various battlefields. As for Shanghai, this is precisely the "Huaihai Campaign" of the "Five-Anti" battle. Winning the Huaihai Campaign lays the foundation for the overall victory.

    The Cunning and Stubborn Attitude of Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Circles Towards the "Five-Anti" Movement

    With the unfolding of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, our working class also launched the counterattack against the bourgeoisie, the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence. When the "Five-Anti" movement first started, Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles were very vigilant, and they rose up to take action. At that time, it was still called the "Four-Anti" movement, and Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles wanted to muddle through by means of "self-reflection and self-reform." The Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce established a "Four-Anti Movement Committee," and various trade associations set up "Four-Anti Branches." The executive and supervisory committee members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce held self-criticism meetings at the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and news reporters were not allowed to attend. It was very relaxed, still with the attitude of "the weather is very good, hahaha!" They talked about small things rather than big things, and about distant things rather than recent things. Some committee members did not even attend the meeting themselves, but sent a secretary to read the self-criticism, trivial and understated, and wanted to get away with it. At the same time, they loudly set up reporting boxes. The Federation of Industry and Commerce had reporting boxes, and various trade associations also had their own reporting boxes. The keys were in the hands of the chairman of the trade association or his secretary, shouting "Report! Report!" If they reported problems in this way, it would be a miracle. The Shanghai industrial and commercial circles wanted to deceive in this way. This is the first stage, very cunning.

    At the expanded joint meeting of the Municipal Production Increase and Economy Committee and the Municipal Consultative Committee on February 5, the government announced that the "Five-Anti" movement would be under the unified leadership of the Municipal Production Increase and Economy Committee, canceled the reporting boxes of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and various trade associations, received their reporting letters, and loudly called on the executive and supervisory committee members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the committee members of various trade associations to sincerely confess to the government, wash their hands, and explain the problems. After this meeting, Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles felt a little nervous, so they changed to a stubborn attitude. They shouted everywhere: "The shock is too great!" "The water is too hot, I can't get in!" They said: "The firepower of the newspapers is too strong, stray bullets hurt people!" It seemed that if they were "shocked," Shanghai would be "in trouble." They wanted the government to prepare fragrant soup and warm water so that they could take a bath. They also wanted the newspapers to behave and not to speak. On the one hand, they created rumors to confuse the public. Things like "capitalist reform," "premature implementation of socialism," and "elimination of the national bourgeoisie" have all been refuted by public opinion. On the other hand, they maliciously slandered, saying strange things like "public and private should not be too close," which is completely ungrateful. After they received the benefits of the government's adjustment of public-private relations and processing orders, and stole state property, they said that the public should not be touched and should not trade with the public. Please think about where the shadow of "state-owned economy leading" is in their thinking? Even more malicious is saying "serving the ruler is like serving a tiger," comparing the People's Government to a tyrant, and falsely accusing the government of being a "tiger." The discerning eyes of the people across the country have seen that the "tiger" is in the industrial and commercial circles. How can you say that the government is the "tiger"? The Shanghai unscrupulous capitalists are really cunning and stubborn. At the symposium held by the Municipal Production Increase and Economy Committee with the executive and supervisory committee members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce on February 11, the government's responsible leaders once again explained the policy, and the tone was somewhat relaxed towards the industrial and commercial circles. This was terrible. It was spread everywhere that someone was "hurt by stray bullets" and "got a scolding"; "It's nothing! It's nothing!" When the shop employees and workers were mobilized, and "battlefield shouting" appeared on the streets, and the奸商 were called out by name to confess, they changed to another attitude, stopped paying wages, and threatened the employees; they gathered to talk about "suicide" to intimidate the government. This is the second stage, quite stubborn.

    Later, seeing that the "wind" of the "Five-Anti" movement was "not strong," and that the shop employees were not moving, they thought that "the wind has passed." They also knew that Sheng Pihua and Wu Yunshu, two representatives, had gone abroad to participate in the international economic conference, so they were greatly relieved. "The bourgeoisie still has political status," and "the government does not want to eliminate the national bourgeoisie." They all got their own answers. After reading and rereading the "Several Provisions of the Central Austerity Inspection Committee on Handling Corruption, Waste, and Overcoming Bureaucratic Errors" and the "Standards and Methods for Classifying and Handling Industrial and Commercial Households in the 'Five-Anti' Movement by the Beijing Municipal People's Government" two documents promulgated by the State Council on March 11, they concluded that: "Now that the government's policy has been announced, the government still takes care of industry and commerce, and the government cannot do without industrial and commercial households." They paid special attention to the third category in the "classification of industrial and commercial households," and many illegal merchants thought they could belong to the "semi-law-abiding and semi-law-breaking households," so they regretted it very much, regretting that they "confessed too much." Yes, the People's Government is firmly implementing the Common Program, and the national bourgeoisie is one of the four democratic classes. Of course, the government must unite them, but illegal industrialists and businessmen must be struggled with clearly and completely, and never carelessly. The Shanghai unscrupulous industrialists and businessmen "deceive themselves with lard" and think that the policy of the "two documents" has "loopholes to exploit." On the one hand, they regretted that some of the things they confessed were "too much," and on the other hand, they swaggered with a "bragging" attitude as if they had nothing to fear. In the past few days, the following two arguments have been widely heard: (1) "We have to pay income tax again, and we have no money to pay." What we have to pay now is the income tax for the second half of 1951, which is the tax that industrial and commercial households should pay for their profits, but they shout "We have no money to pay!" The phenomenon of private enterprises delaying the payment of income tax is now widespread in Shanghai, and the tax bureau is preparing to punish them according to law. (2) "The arrogance of the workers and shop employees is too high, and it is impossible to do anything." What they mean by saying this is as if to say "The government is nothing, but the workers and shop employees are annoying." They want the government to come out and suppress the workers and shop employees so that they can work properly. These bosses are really confused. Today's "Five-Anti" movement is precisely to suppress the arrogance of the capitalists so that you can work properly under the leadership of the working class in the future. Some capitalists have also stated in public: "We capitalists love money, and there is nothing to say." These words sound very frank and seem "carefree." We cannot prevent capitalists from loving money. The "Five-Anti" movement is to make capitalists love money and abide by the law, and to make you earn money within the scope of the law. This is the current third stage, very "bragging."

    The Shanghai bourgeoisie is so cunning, stubborn, and "bragging." They are treating the "Five-Anti" movement with this attitude. Is it okay? No, it is not. They cannot get away with this. The "Five-Anti" battle has won brilliant victories in major cities across the country. Taking Tianjin as an example, as of March 5, the victory report of the Tianjin Shop Employees' Union had revealed 680 big tiger奸商, including one big tiger who stole 70 billion yuan. Shanghai is much larger than Tianjin. Shanghai is a tiger's den, and there must be many big tigers. The number will definitely not be less than Tianjin, and the weight will definitely be fatter than Tianjin. Please think about it in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles: Is it over if only a few奸商 like Wang Kangnian and Xu Miaoxin are caught? Since the establishment of the Municipal Production Increase and Economy Committee and the government called on the industrial and commercial circles to confess and check illegal activities, it has been more than two months. People from all over the country have come to Shanghai to investigate cases related to the "Five-Anti," and there are more than 300,000 letters of accusation from workers and shop employees. Accusations of all kinds of crimes are made. Can the government not deal with them? The "two documents" promulgated by the State Council have been out for more than a week. You should always link them to your own problems, think seriously, check carefully, and confess honestly. If you do not seriously reflect and honestly confess, when are you waiting for? You must seize the initiative, confess quickly, and do not wait until the law catches up with you to regret it.

    Smash the Bourgeoisie's Deep Trenches and High Fortifications in Shanghai and Strive for the Complete Victory of the "Five-Anti" Struggle

    The situation is extremely clear, and the time has come. In order to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, to wash away the filth and poison left over from the old society, to protect national interests and the people's cause, to ensure the economic construction of the new democracy and the victorious future of socialism, and to consolidate the leadership of the working class, our working class must resolutely repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks. Shanghai is the main base of the Chinese bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie's deep trenches and high fortifications are set up in Shanghai. We must smash the bourgeoisie's deep trenches and high fortifications in Shanghai to achieve the complete victory of the great "Five-Anti" struggle and to completely repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks. The situation is extremely clear, and the time has come. Our Shanghai working class must resolutely and bravely carry out the combat tasks of the "Five-Anti" movement and beautifully and thoroughly win this "Huaihai Campaign" in the "Five-Anti" battle!

    In this way, it can be combined with the victories on various battlefields across the country to achieve the complete victory of the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence. In this way, it will be a great victory for the people of the whole country under the leadership of the working class, and even the national bourgeoisie will be transformed and progress.

    All the worker brothers in Shanghai, holding high the glorious banner of Mao Zedong, move forward, smash the bourgeoisie's deep trenches and high fortifications in Shanghai, and strive for the complete victory of the "Five-Anti" struggle!

    打垮资产阶级在上海的深沟高垒
    王芸生
    伟大的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争，已在全国范围内获得基本的胜利，但在上海还只刚刚开始。“五反”运动，在上海是开展得比较迟了，这固然有种种必然如此的原因，却也因此招致一些不必要的心理上的影响。这些心理上的影响主要的有两个：（一）在上海以外的地方看来，上海这样资产阶级集中的地方，只搞几天就完了，因此暗暗叹息“还是上海资本家有办法！”（二）上海的不法厂商以为真是“一阵风刮过去了”，甚至心中暗笑“政府还是离不开咱们工商界！”其实这两者都是误会，上海的“五反”斗争，到今天才算正式开始，一定要认真地进行，大规模地有系统地展开，以争取彻底的胜利，不获全胜，决不收兵！
    上海是中国资产阶级的大本营
    三年以来，资产阶级对工人阶级、中国共产党和人民政府举行了如此的猖狂进攻，使国家人民遭受到如此的重大损害，今天我们工人阶级发动对资产阶级的反攻，以彻底打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，上海正是这一场激烈斗争的主要阵地。争取到上海“五反”斗争的彻底胜利，才算全国的斗争获得完全的胜利；缺了上海这一战场的胜利，这一次伟大的“五反”运动就不能算是完全胜利。
    上海是中国资产阶级的大本营，上海拥有五百万以上的城市人口，上海拥有十几万工商户，在全国的私营工商业中占有绝对的比重。上海资产阶级，在全国范围中，最典型，最有代表性，也最阴险刁猾，最有经验。旧中国是半封建半殖民地的，中国的资产阶级是在半封建半殖民地的经济中形成的，上海是个核心，因此上海的资产阶级特别具有买办性和流氓性。上海产生过伺候帝国主义、勾结北洋军阀的大买办大商人的傅筱菴；产生过榨取洋场暴利、孕育蒋匪帮官僚资本集团的虞洽卿；产生过流氓帮会头子兼大资本家的杜月笙；产生过运用“洋泾浜”骗术以白手起家的黄楚九；今天就产生出纯粹诈欺投机丧尽天良的王康年。这一系列的上海资本家典型，不仅唯利是图，损人利己，投机取巧，他们具有勾结帝国主义、出卖国家民族利益、做洋场恶奴的买办本领，他们也擅长公堂打滚、刀头舔血的流氓作风。上海的资产阶级的确不好斗，很难缠。因为他们具有这种传统，擅长这种作风，所以王康年、张新根、徐苗新敢以假药臭肉暗害我们人民志愿军，所以李汉民敢于偷工减料以损害祖国伟大建设的淮河工程，所以赵金峰敢于以假棕绳坏机器危害我们人民解放军。这种伤天害理、骇人听闻的罪行，普遍激起全国人民的愤怒，但在具有流氓买办性的上海奸商，却正是他们出色当行的“拿手好戏”。
    解放以来，上海应该改造了，上海资产阶级实在未曾得到多大的改造。跑了的一些资本家，他们实在是与帝国主义和蒋匪帮四大家族无法分开的反革命分子。留下的一律得到人民政府的照顾，政治上有地位，有政协代表、政府委员、人民代表会议代表、协商委员，是人民政权的主人翁之一；经济上得利益，困难时，人民政府多方照顾，加工定货，调整公私关系，使上海工商业起死回生，到经济好转时，就大发其财。一九五一年是上海工商界大发财的一年，单是账簿上的盈余就是几万亿元人民币，若加上偷漏盗窃，五毒俱全，可能又是一个几万亿元。升官发财，猖狂进攻，兼而有之。解放以来，上海资产阶级是很神气的，还是“吃得开”。到处神气活现，侃侃而争，在场面上要“占上风”，实际里要争领导权，上海资产阶级曾经要求把全国工商联设在上海，俨然以上海为全国的“经济首都”，他们所无意流露出来的思想就是如此的狂妄。
    上海是中国资产阶级的大本营，中国资产阶级的深沟高垒就设置在上海，我们工人阶级要向资产阶级反攻，怎能轻轻放过上海资产阶级？我们要争取反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动的完全胜利，岂能漏掉上海不法厂商这个重大对象？“五反”战斗的捷报已从全国各大城市纷纷飞来，那是各个战场的胜利；至于上海，这里正是“五反”战斗的淮海大战。打胜了淮海大战，就奠定了全胜的战局。
    上海工商界对待“五反”运动
    的狡猾顽强态度
    随着反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的展开，我们工人阶级向资产阶级反攻的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动也开始了。在“五反”运动刚开始的时候，上海工商界是很有警觉性的，他们就起来搞了。那时还叫“四反运动”，上海工商界是想以“自反自”的方式来矇混过关。上海工商联成立了“四反运动委员会”，各同业公会纷纷设立“四反分会”。工商联的执监委员们在工商联开会作自我检讨了，不许新闻记者旁听，很轻松地，依然是“天气很好，哈哈哈！”的态度，说小不说大，谈远不谈近，有几位委员还不自己到会，派个秘书代表代读检讨书，鸡毛蒜皮，轻描淡写，就要交代过关。同时大张旗鼓地设检举箱，工商联有检举箱，各同业公会也各有其检举箱，钥匙拿在同业公会主任委员或其秘书的手里，高喊“检举呵！检举呵！”如此检举，它若检举出问题来，才真是怪事。上海工商界就想如此欺骗了事。这是第一阶段，狡猾得很。
    到二月五日开市增产节约委员会与市协商委员会扩大联席会议，政府宣布“五反”运动由市增产节约委员会统一领导，取消工商联及各同业公会的检举箱，接收其检举信，并大声疾呼地要工商联执监委员及各同业公会的委员们认真向政府坦白，洗清手脸，交代问题。经过这次会议之后，上海工商界感觉有些紧张了，于是又换出一副顽强态度。他们到处喊：“震动太大了！”“水太烫了，下不去！”说：“各报的火力太猛了，流弹伤人！”好像他们一受“震动”，上海就“不得了”。要政府预备香汤温水，以便他们淴浴。更要各报乖乖地，不要讲话。一面又造作流言蜚语，以混淆听闻。什么“资改”呵，“提前实行社会主义”呵，“消灭民族资产阶级”呵，这都经舆论一一驳斥了。一面又恶毒中伤，说什么“公私授受不亲”的怪话，是完全忘恩负义，他们受到政府调整公私关系、加工定货之利、并盗窃国家资财之后，却说公家沾不得，莫与公家交易，请想他们的思想哪有“国营经济领导”的踪影？更恶毒的是说“伴君如伴虎”，把人民政府比作暴君，转诬政府是“虎”。全国人民的雪亮眼睛都已看见“虎”在工商界，怎么说政府是“虎”？上海不法资本家真是刁顽。到二月十一日市增产节约委员会邀工商联执监委员举行座谈会，政府负责首长再度解释了政策，语气之间对工商界松了一些。这可不得了，到处传达，某某人“流弹伤人”，“吃了排头”；“没什么！没什么！”顶到店员工人动员了，街头出现“阵地喊话”，点名招呼奸商坦白了，他们就另换一副态度，停发工资，威胁职工；聚谈“自杀”，恫吓政府。这是第二阶段，相当顽强。
    以后看“五反”运动的“风声不大”了，店员不动了，他们认为“风刮过去了”。又知道盛丕华、吴蕴初两位当了代表出国去参加国际经济会议了，于是大为放心，“资产阶级还有政治地位”，“政府并不要消灭民族资产阶级”，他们都自己得到答案了。顶到三月十一日政务院命令公布的“中央节约检查委员会关于处理贪污、浪费及克服官僚主义错误的若干规定”及“北京市人民政府在‘五反’运动中关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法”两个文件，读了又读，看了又看，读过看过之后得出的结论是：“现在政府的政策公布了，政府仍然是照顾工商业的，政府离开工商户是不行的。”他们特别注意“工商户分类”中的第三类，许多不法商人以为他可以属于“半守法半违法户”，因此甚为后悔，后悔他“坦白得太多了”。是的，人民政府是坚决执行共同纲领的，民族资产阶级是四个民主阶级之一，政府当然要团结他们，但是对于不法的工商业者就一定要斗争个一清二白，绝不马虎。上海的不法工商业者“自吃猪油自蒙心”地以为“两文件”的政策有“空子可钻”，一面后悔他所坦白的一部分“太多了”，一面又像有恃无恐地耍“牛皮”手段。最近几天普遍听到以下两种论调：（一）“又要缴所得税了，没得钱，缴不出。”现在要缴的是一九五一年下半年的所得税，是工商业户盈利所得应缴的税，竟喊“没得钱，缴不出！”现在上海正普遍出现私营企业拖延缴纳所得税的现象，税务局准备依法惩治。（二）“工人店员的气焰太高了，没法办事。”他们说这种话的意思，好像是说“政府还没什么，只是工人店员讨厌”，要政府出来压压工人店员，才好。这些老板真糊涂思想，今天的“五反”运动，就正是要把资本家的气焰打下去，让你们今后在工人阶级的领导之下规规矩矩地办事。还有的资本家在大庭广众中声言：“我伲资产阶级是爱铜钿咯，呒啥话头。”这话听来很为率真，也似“满不在乎”。我们没法不让资本家爱钱，“五反”运动是要资本家们爱钱兼守法，是要你们在法律范围内赚钱。这是目前的第三阶段，“牛皮”得很。
    上海资产阶级就是这样的狡猾、顽强而“牛皮”，他们是以这种态度来对待“五反”运动。行吗？不行的。他们这一套是过不了关的。“五反”战斗，已在全国各大城市获得辉煌胜利，以天津为例，天津店员工会的告捷书，截至三月五日为止，已打出奸商大老虎六百八十只，其中还有盗窃七百亿元的大老虎一只。上海的规模比天津大得多，上海是虎穴，必多大老虎，数目之多决不会少于天津，分量之肥也一定比天津的还肥。请上海工商界想一想：只有王康年徐苗新等几个奸商落网就算完了吗？自从市增产节约委员会成立，政府号召工商界坦白检查不法行为以来，业已两个多月的时间，全国各地都有人到上海查办有关“五反”的案件，工人店员的检举信有三十多万件，各个罪行都有检举，政府能够不处理吗？政务院公布的“两个文件”又已经一个多星期了，你们总应该联系各个自己的问题，认真地想想，痛切地检查，老老实实地坦白了。再不认真反省，老实坦白，更等待何时？必须争取主动，赶快坦白，莫待法网及身，就悔之晚矣。
    打垮资产阶级在上海的深沟高垒，争取“五反”斗争的 彻底胜利
    事势极明，时候已到，我们工人阶级为了响应毛主席的伟大号召，洗清旧社会遗留下来的污毒，为了保护国家利益及人民事业，为了保证新民主主义的经济建设及社会主义的胜利前途，为了巩固工人阶级的领导权，都必须坚决打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻。上海是中国资产阶级的大本营，资产阶级的深沟高垒就设在上海，我们必须打垮了资产阶级在上海的深沟高垒，才能取得伟大的“五反”斗争的彻底胜利，才能完全打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻。事势极明，时候已到，我们上海工人阶级要坚决勇敢地执行“五反”运动的战斗任务，漂漂亮亮地、彻彻底底地打胜“五反”战斗中的这一场“淮海大战”！
    这样，就可与全国各个战场的胜利相汇合，获得反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动的完全胜利。这样，将是以工人阶级为领导的全国人民的大胜利，连民族资产阶级也获得改造和进步。
    全上海的工人兄弟们，高举着毛泽东的光辉旗帜前进，打垮资产阶级在上海的深沟高垒，争取“五反”斗争的彻底胜利！
