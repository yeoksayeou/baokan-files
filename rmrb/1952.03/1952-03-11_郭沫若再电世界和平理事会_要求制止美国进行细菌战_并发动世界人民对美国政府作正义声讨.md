The telegram reads as follows: Mr. Raphael of the World Peace Council in Prague, and forwarded to Chairman Joliot-Curie:

    Telegram of the 1st acknowledged. The American troops are still continuing their inhumane bacteriological warfare, and have expanded it from the Korean battlefield to the northeastern region of our country. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, made a second serious protest on March 8th. Now, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and various democratic parties also issued protests on the 8th, including appeals to the people of the world and peace organizations. I hereby enclose the protest for your review. Our people sincerely hope that the World Peace Council will, in accordance with the solemn resolutions of previous sessions, take effective measures to stop it, and hope to mobilize the peace associations of various countries to unanimously and righteously denounce the US government. I hereby suggest that you consider this together.
