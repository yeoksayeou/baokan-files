    A Thorough Investigation Should Be Conducted into the Embezzlement and Misappropriation of Donations in Some Counties, Districts, and Townships in Northern Jiangsu
    Editor: The movement to donate weapons in various parts of Northern Jiangsu has now come to an end. However, there are still many places that have failed to settle accounts in a timely manner in accordance with the regulations of the China Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, and publicize them to the masses. They have also failed to hand over the donations in full. Some cadres have even embezzled and misappropriated donations. For example, Yuan Maorong, the Communist Party branch secretary of Longtan Township, Tannan District, Sheyang County, embezzled 580,000 yuan in donations; Yuan Shizhang, the financial and grain officer, misappropriated 300,000 yuan. The Daqiao Cooperative in Fangqiang District retained 85 million yuan in donations as funds for purchasing cotton. Xiao Zhengcai, the director of the farmers' association in Hongcai Township, Tanbei District, took the lead in gambling using donations. Township cadres in Youying Township, Baoying County, withheld 5,000 jin of donated rice and more than 1 million yuan in cash, intending to build a township office. In addition, similar situations exist in other counties, districts, and townships. Due to these reasons, donation accounts in various places have not been settled quickly, nor dare they be publicized to the masses, thus creating a very bad political influence among the masses. I hope that the leaders of the counties and districts in Northern Jiangsu will pay attention to this issue, thoroughly investigate any embezzlers and misappropriators, order them to return the donations, and give them due punishment according to the severity of the circumstances.
                                                                                                    Tang Xingkui

    苏北部分县、区、乡应彻查贪污挪用捐款的现象
    编辑同志：苏北各地捐献武器运动，业已先后宣告结束。但还有不少地方未能按照抗美援朝总会的规定，及时结清账目，并向群众公布，亦未能将捐献款如数上缴。某些干部，甚至贪污、挪用捐献款项。如射阳县潭南区龙潭乡中共支部书记袁茂荣贪污了捐献款五十八万元；财粮员袁石章挪用三十万元。方强区大桥合作社将八千五百万元捐献款留作收购棉花资金。潭北区宏才乡农会主任萧正才动支捐献款带头赌博。宝应县友映乡乡干部扣留捐献稻子五千斤，人民币一百多万元，准备建筑乡公所。此外，其他县、区、乡也有类似情况。由于这些原因，各地的捐献账目，未能很快结清，也不敢向群众公布，因而在群众中造成了极坏的政治影响。我希望苏北区各县、区领导方面注意这个问题，把任何贪污、挪用者追查清楚，责令归还捐献款项，并按情节轻重给以应得的处分。    唐星魁
