Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 28th: Today, our chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, sent a memorandum to the U.S. chief liaison officer, Kenney, lodging a serious protest against the U.S. aircraft scattering leaflets aimed at insulting our army in the Panmunjom conference area around 5:20 PM on March 25th.

The memorandum pointed out: The leaflets scattered by U.S. aircraft on the 25th were found at thirty locations within the conference area. Security officers from both sides immediately investigated the incident around 6:00 PM that day. This is another unreasonable act by the U.S. side in violating the agreement on the conference area between the two sides, following the U.S. side's shelling of insulting leaflets into the conference area on March 7th.

The U.S. side has taken a denying attitude towards the responsible event on March 7th. However, the fact that the U.S. side repeatedly scattered leaflets insulting our side in the Panmunjom conference area cannot be denied by the U.S. side.

The memorandum also demanded that the U.S. side make a responsible handling of and response to this reckless and continuous act of arbitrarily violating the agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 28th: At the staff meeting on the fourth item of the Korean Armistice Negotiations agenda on March 28th, our staff officers questioned and protested the other side's open violation of the understanding regarding news releases during administrative meetings, and stated that if the other side continues to do so, we will no longer consider ourselves bound by this understanding. The two sides then continued to exchange views on the issue of prisoner repatriation.

At the staff meeting on the third item of the agenda, the two sides continued to discuss the text of the armistice agreement draft.

    美机竟向会场区散发荒谬传单
    我方联络官向对方提出严重抗议
    我并抗议美方公然破坏行政性会议的协议
    【新华社开城二十八日电】今日我方首席联络官张春山上校致美方首席联络官肯尼备忘录一件，对三月二十五日下午五时二十分左右美方飞机一架在板门店会场区一带散发以侮辱我军为目的传单一事，向对方提出严重抗议。
    备忘录指出：二十五日美方飞机散发的传单，经发现落在会场区内三十个地点。双方安全军官在当日下午六时左右，立即对此事件进行了调查，这是美方继三月七日向会场区炮发侮辱我方的传单以后，又一次破坏双方有关会场区协议的无理行为。
    美方对三月七日应负责任的事件曾采取抵赖的态度。但美方一再将侮辱我方的传单散发在板门店会场区内的事实却是美方所抵赖不了的。
    备忘录并要求美方对这种毫无忌惮地不断恣意破坏协议的行为作负责的处理与答复。
    【新华社开城二十八日电】三月二十八日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程参谋会议上，我方参谋人员就对方公然破坏关于举行行政性会议时有关新闻发布的谅解一点提出质问与抗议，并表示如对方继续如此作，则我方将不再认为受此项谅解的约束。双方旋就遣俘问题继续交换意见。
    第三项议程参谋会议上，双方继续就停战协定草案的文字，进行了讨论。
