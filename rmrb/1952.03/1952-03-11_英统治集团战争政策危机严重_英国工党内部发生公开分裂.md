Xinhua News Agency, London, March 10th: Amidst the increasingly severe political and economic crisis caused by the war policy, the chaos and contradictions within the British ruling clique have further intensified. This is particularly evident in the split within the Labour Party, which plays the role of the opposition party.

When the British House of Commons held a foreign policy debate in late February, Conservative Prime Minister Churchill, in an attempt to shirk responsibility, revealed that the previous Labour government had secretly undertaken obligations to the United States to support the US's expansion of the war of aggression against Korea. The disclosure of this secret agreement between the Labour leadership and the US government aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the British people and Labour Party members. Reuters said in its report that the "cracks" within the Labour Party "have been deepened as a result."

In the subsequent "defense" debate discussing the British arms expansion plan, the contradictions within the Labour Party erupted into an open split. A group of Labour MPs, led by the political careerist Bevan, seeing the growing dissatisfaction of the British people with the arms expansion and war preparation policy, believed that it was necessary to make some concessions to the arms expansion plan and maintain symbolic social welfare funds in order to win over the people. The Labour leadership group, headed by Attlee and Morrison, which was even more obsequiously loyal to US monopoly capital, wanted to use this popular opposition to increase its own political capital, but was also deeply afraid of offending its US masters. Therefore, they believed that they should not attack the arms expansion plan, which was in fact drafted by the Labour Party itself under US orders, but only criticize the Conservative government for "not being able" to implement the military buildup plan. In order to unify their steps, Attlee convened a secret meeting of the Labour Party parliamentary group on the 4th, using party discipline to restrain members from taking consistent action, not opposing the arms expansion and war preparation plan, but supporting the censure of the Churchill government.

On the 5th, the House of Commons voted on the arms expansion plan. Sixty-two Labour MPs from the Bevan group disregarded the decision of the Labour Party parliamentary group's secret meeting the day before and abstained from voting on Attlee's motion expressing no confidence in the Churchill government's ability to implement the arms expansion plan. In the subsequent vote on the arms expansion plan itself, the majority of Labour MPs, headed by Attlee and Morrison, expressed their acquiescence by abstaining, while Bevan and 56 other Labour MPs voted against it. Thus, in the two votes, more than one-fifth of the Labour MPs, including four members of the Labour Party National Executive Committee, openly violated party discipline and acted on their own in Parliament.

At present, the serious chaos and disputes within the Labour Party are continuing to develop. Attlee has decided to convene a meeting of the Labour Party parliamentary group on the 12th to discuss ways to sanction Bevan and others. At the same time, Labour General Secretary Phillips accepted Bevan's request and decided to hold a special meeting of the Labour Party National Executive Committee on the 14th to resolve the dispute.

The contradictions within the Labour Party have been brewing for a long time, and now they have finally erupted publicly. This is the result of the increasing opposition of the broad masses of the British people and ordinary Labour Party members to the war policy and the intensification of the right-wing Labour leadership. This fact shows that the policy of war and poverty pursued by the British ruling clique is encountering an increasingly serious crisis.

    英统治集团战争政策危机严重
    英国工党内部发生公开分裂
    【新华社十日讯】伦敦消息：在战争政策所造成的日益严重的政治经济危机中，英国统治集团内部的混乱和矛盾进一步加深，这特别表现在充当反对党角色的工党的分裂上。
    当二月下旬英国议会下院进行外交政策辩论时，保守党政府首相邱吉尔，为了推卸责任，透露了前任工党政府曾向美国秘密承担支持美国扩大侵朝战争的义务。工党领导方面与美国政府间这一秘密协议的泄露，引起了英国人民和工党党员的广泛不满，路透社在其消息中说，工党内部的“裂痕”“已因此而加深”。
    在接着举行的讨论英国扩军计划的“国防”辩论中，工党内部的矛盾更爆发为公开的分裂。以政治野心家比万为首的一批工党议员，由于看到英国广大人民对于扩军备战政策的日益强烈的不满，认为有必要对扩军计划作某些缓和的表示并维持象征性的社会福利经费，借以笼络人心。而更加奴颜婢膝地效忠于美国垄断资本的以艾德礼、莫里逊为首的工党领导集团，既想利用人民这种反对情绪为自己增加政治资本，而又深怕拂逆美国主人的心意，因此他们认为不能攻击事实上是工党自己在美国命令下拟订的扩军计划，而只应非难保守党政府“没有能力”执行军备计划。为了统一步调，艾德礼在四日召集了一次工党议会党团的秘密会议，用党纪约束议员采取一致行动，不反对扩军备战计划而支持对邱吉尔政府的责备。
    五日，下院就扩军计划进行表决。比万集团的六十二名工党议员不顾前一天工党议会党团秘密会议的决定，在表决艾德礼提出的对邱吉尔政府执行军备计划的能力表示不信任的提案时弃了权。在接着举行的对军备计划本身投票时，以艾德礼、莫里逊为首的多数工党议员以弃权表示了他们的默认，而比万等五十六个工党议员又投票表示反对。这样，在两次投票中，有五分之一以上的工党议员，其中包括四名工党全国执行委员会委员，公然违反党纪的约束，在议会中自行其是。
    目前，工党内部严重的混乱和争执正在继续发展中，艾德礼已决定在十二日召开工党议会党团会议，商讨制裁比万等人的办法。同时工党总书记菲利浦接受了比万的要求，决定在十四日举行工党全国执行委员会的特别会议来解决这一争端。
    工党内部的矛盾酝酿已久，现在终于公开爆发出来，这是英国广大人民和工党普通党员对于战争政策和右翼工党领导加紧反对的结果。这个事实说明：英国统治集团所奉行的战争与贫困政策，已经遭遇到越来越严重的危机。
