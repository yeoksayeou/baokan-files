    Smash the Vicious Germ Warfare Attack of the American Aggressors
    Bacteriologist Gao Shiqi
    The extremely vicious American aggressors dare to carry out inhumane germ warfare in Korea, regardless of everything. Recently, they have even more frantically expanded the scope of germ warfare to Northeast China.
    This monstrous crime of the American aggressors is intolerable.
    This tells us that the American aggressors have betrayed human justice and betrayed science; they are the enemies of mankind.
    Bacteria, infectious disease bacteria, are also enemies of mankind, just like the American aggressors; in the past, there have been many tragic scars in human history.
    The extremely vicious plague bacillus, the most terrible enemy of mankind, the terror of the Black Death in 14th-century Europe, was caused by its atrocities.
    The extremely vicious cholera bacillus has spread throughout the world six times in the 19th century alone.
    There are also other extremely vicious poisonous bacteria, which, like the American aggressors, use various insidious and vicious means to attack mankind.
    However, the epidemic of these major plagues has its own special reasons, special climates, and special environments that come together to form it. Now, with the progress of science and health in the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, the era of rampant plague and cholera has passed, just as the era of American imperialism has passed.
    A cornered dog will jump over the wall; when the American aggressors are at their wit's end, they vainly attempt to use germ warfare to expand their war of aggression in order to achieve their ambition of conquering Asia and conquering the whole world.
    The American aggressors are truly cruel and use every kind of poison, and they can do anything.
    That is to say, they want to create artificial epidemics in Korea and China.
    However, germ warfare is just playing tricks with infectious diseases. If we expose the inside story of that trick and block and eliminate it according to the law of infectious disease development, it can be eliminated, and we don't need to panic and worry.
    However, when dealing with bacteria, insects that spread bacteria, and the American aggressors who spread bacteria and insects, we must always be vigilant and do our best to eliminate them.
    We must be prepared, planned, led, and organized to do this.
    On the one hand, we rely on the power of science to organize all medical and health workers across the country into the ranks of epidemic prevention and into the ranks of anti-bacterial warfare. On the other hand, we rely on the power of the people to launch a large-scale movement to popularize health and epidemic prevention knowledge. We must ensure that everyone is prepared.
    With the combination of the power of science and the power of the people, under the banner of Mao Zedong, we will surely be able to smash the vicious germ warfare attack of the American aggressors.

    粉碎美国侵略者细菌战的恶毒进攻
    细菌学家  高士其
    穷凶极恶的美国侵略者，竟敢不顾一切地在朝鲜进行灭绝人性的细菌战争。最近更疯狂地扩大细菌战的范围到我国的东北。
    美国侵略者的这种滔天罪行，是不能容忍的。
    这是告诉我们，美国侵略者背叛了人类正义，背叛了科学，它是人类的恶敌。
    细菌，传染疫病的细菌，也和美国侵略者一样是人类的恶敌；在过去人类的历史上，就有不少惨痛的伤痕。
    穷凶极恶的鼠疫菌，人类最可怕的恶敌，欧洲十四世纪黑死的恐怖，就是由它行凶。
    穷凶极恶的霍乱菌，单在十九世纪中，就有六次流行于全世界。
    还有其他穷凶极恶的毒菌，也和美国侵略者一样，用种种阴险恶毒的手段，向人类进攻。
    但是，这些大时疫的流行，自有他特殊的原因，特殊的气候，特殊的环境，合着而成的。现在苏联和人民民主国家，科学和卫生事业的进步，已经战胜了细菌，鼠疫和霍乱横行的时代，已成过去，就像美帝国主义横行的时代已经过去一样。
    狗急跳墙；美国侵略者在穷极无聊的时候，妄想利用细菌战来扩大侵略战争，以达到其征服亚洲、征服全世界的野心。
    美国侵略者，真是一心残酷，无毒不使，样样做得出。
    那就是说：他们要在朝鲜和中国各地来制造人工的时疫了。
    但是，细菌战争，不过是玩传染病的把戏。我们若揭穿了那把戏的内幕，按照传染病发展的规律去阻击它，扑灭它，是可以消灭它的，我们用不着惊慌和忧虑。
    但是，我们对付细菌、对付传播细菌的昆虫，和对付撒布细菌、昆虫的美国侵略者一样，必须时时刻刻都要提高警惕，用全力去扑灭它。
    这我们必须有准备，有计划，有领导，有组织地去干。
    一方面依靠科学的力量，把全国医药卫生工作者，都组织到防疫的队伍里去，组织到反细菌战的队伍里去。一方面依靠人民的力量，大规模地开展卫生防疫知识普及的运动。要做到人人都有准备。
    科学的力量和人民的力量结合起来，在毛泽东旗帜之下，我们一定可以粉碎美国侵略者细菌战的恶毒进攻。
