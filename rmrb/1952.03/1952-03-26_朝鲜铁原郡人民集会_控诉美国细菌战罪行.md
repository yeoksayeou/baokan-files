Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 25th: More than 3,000 people in the Chorwon County area on the central Korean front held rallies on March 6, accusing the US aggressors of using bacteriological weapons to brutally massacre the Korean people.

From January 28 to mid-February, US military aircraft scattered insects carrying germs in many places in Chorwon County. The people of Chorwon County personally witnessed US aircraft dropping large numbers of germ-carrying insects from the air. They all expressed their utmost indignation and accused the US aggressors of this heinous crime at the meetings.

Farmer Bai Shuiyuan, after reporting on what he personally saw of US planes scattering insects carrying germs, said: "When the US invading army occupied this area the year before last, I fled to the rear, where I often saw US planes brutally bombing peaceful people. Later, the Korean and Chinese People's Forces drove away the US bandits and recovered this area, so I was able to return home and farm properly. Now, the US bandits are using such vicious and despicable means to harm us again. They are my enemies for life." Another Korean resident, Old Lady Lin, cried in grief while making her accusations. She said: "US aggressors, you killed my husband and you still want to take my life. I cannot avenge this hatred, I will not be able to die in peace!" The angry people unanimously demanded that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers strike the US aggressors even harder and never allow the US bandits to be so rampant.

The people of Chorwon County, who have been tempered and strengthened in the anti-aggression war, have a high degree of confidence in defeating the US bandits' germ warfare. The Korean people in a certain village said: "We have already done a good job in epidemic prevention, and we also have the righteous support of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the people of the whole world. This vicious conspiracy of the US aggressors will surely meet with a final and miserable defeat."

At the accusation meetings in various places in Chorwon County, resolutions were passed to accuse the US aggressors of their large-scale bacteriological warfare atrocities to the people of the world, demanding severe punishment for the public enemy of mankind – the US bacteriological war criminals. Everyone present at the meeting signed the indictment.

    朝鲜铁原郡人民集会
    控诉美国细菌战罪行
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】朝鲜中部前线铁原郡地区三千多人民在三月六日分别集会，控诉美国侵略者使用细菌武器疯狂屠杀朝鲜人民的残暴罪行。
    从一月二十八日到二月中旬，美国军用飞机在铁原郡许多地方撒布了带有病菌的昆虫，铁原郡人民曾亲眼看见美国飞机从空中把大量带菌昆虫撒下来。他们都以万分激愤的心情，在会上控诉了美国侵略者的这种滔天罪行。
    农民白水原在报告了他亲眼看到美国飞机撒布带有病菌的昆虫的情形以后说：“前年美国侵略军侵占这一带时，我逃到后方，在那里经常看到美国飞机残暴地轰炸和平人民。后来朝中人民部队赶走了美国强盗，收复了这一带地方，我才能够回到家里来好好种地。现在，美国强盗又用这种毒辣卑鄙的手段来害我们，它们是我一生一世的仇敌。”另一位朝鲜居民林老太太在控诉时悲愤得哭起来。她说：“美国侵略军呀，你们杀死了我的丈夫，还要害我的命，我报不了这个仇，死也不能闭目！”愤怒的人们一致要求朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军更加沉重地打击美国侵略军，决不容许美国强盗这样横行霸道。
    在反侵略战争中锻炼得更加坚强的铁原郡人民，对于打败美国强盗的细菌战，具有高度的信心。某里的朝鲜人民说：“我们已经做好了防疫工作，而且我们还有苏联、各人民民主国家和全世界人民的正义支持，美国侵略者这种恶毒的阴谋一定要遭到最后的惨败。”
    铁原郡人民在各处的控诉会上都通过决议，向全世界人民控诉美国侵略者进行大规模细菌战的暴行，要求严厉惩罚人类的公敌——美国细菌战犯。到会的人都在控诉书上签了名。
