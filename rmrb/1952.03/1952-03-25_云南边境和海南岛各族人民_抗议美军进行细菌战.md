    The atrocities of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China have aroused great anger among the people of various ethnic groups on the Yunnan border and Hainan Island.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, the people of Baoshan, Yingjiang, Lianghe and other counties in western Yunnan suffered from the harm caused by the Japanese invaders spreading bacteria. Gong Shou (Dai nationality), Director of the Lianghe Nationalities Administrative Committee, and Sha Yushu (Hui nationality) of Baoshan, and others, angrily protested against American imperialism's use of bacteriological weapons, and stated: The people of all ethnic groups living on the border of the motherland must strengthen unity, consolidate national defense, and crush the conspiracies of American imperialism.
    Local organizations of various democratic parties in Hainan Island, people's organizations in Hainan Island, fraternal ethnic groups, medical workers, workers, farmers, soldiers, women, Christians, teachers, students, Young Pioneers, and others, have successively issued statements and protest letters. They unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement of March 8, and resolutely expressed their determination to fight back against the new conspiracies of American imperialism with practical actions. The Hainan People's Hospital and Hainan Medical College and other schools have already had 175 medical workers and students sign up to join the volunteer anti-epidemic medical team to Korea.

    抗议美军进行细菌战
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国东北境内使用细菌武器的暴行，激起了云南边境和海南岛各族人民的极大愤怒。
    抗日战争时期，云南西部保山、盈江、梁河等县人民曾经遭受过日寇撒布细菌的毒害。梁河民族行政委员会主任委员龚绶（傣族）和保山沙玉淑（回族）等愤怒抗议美帝国主义使用细菌武器，并表示：居住在祖国边疆的各族人民更要加强团结，巩固国防，粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋活动。
    各民主党派在海南岛的地方组织、海南岛各人民团体、兄弟民族、医务工作者、工人、农民、战士、妇女、基督教徒、教师、学生、少年儿童队员等纷纷发表声明和抗议书。一致拥护周恩来外长三月八日的严正声明，并坚决表示以实际行动来回击美帝国主义的新阴谋。海南人民医院和海南医科专门学校等校，已有一百七十五名医务工作者和学生报名参加志愿赴朝防疫医疗队。
