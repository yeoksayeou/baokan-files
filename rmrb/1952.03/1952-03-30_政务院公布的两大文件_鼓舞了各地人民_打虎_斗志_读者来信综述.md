    The Two Documents Promulgated by the Government Administration Council
    Inspired the People Across the Country to "Fight the Tigers"
    -- Summary of Readers' Letters
    The readers of this newspaper have written letters one after another, supporting the two documents promulgated by the Central Committee for the Economy and the People's Government: "Several Provisions Regarding the Handling of Corruption, Waste, and Overcoming Bureaucratic Errors" and the Beijing Municipal People's Government's "Standards and Methods for Classifying and Handling Industrial and Commercial Households in the 'Five-Anti' Movement."
    Guo Zongyao, Ren Gufeng, Jiang Binglin and others from the office of the Economy Committee of Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, wrote: "After studying these two documents, our understanding has improved. Many corrupt elements have also relieved their worries. Some corrupt elements said, 'We must change our previous dishonest attitude and explain our problems to the people.' Some corrupt elements confessed their corruption crimes or previous deceptions on the spot at the study meeting." Chen Buxiang from the Beijing Post Office wrote: "The staff of our bureau have generally studied these two documents. Many corrupt elements, according to the provisions of the documents and in connection with their own corruption, continue to explain their problems; some said that they would return the stolen goods as soon as possible and atone for their crimes. These two documents have greatly encouraged our determination to 'fight the tigers'."
    Zhang Jun from the spare-time school of the Beijing No. 546 Factory wrote:
    "From these two documents, I deeply realized how lenient the People's Government is to all genuinely honest corrupt elements. All corrupt elements and thieves who resist confession should wake up and stop dreaming of taking advantage of loopholes or thinking that 'the movement will pass' and 'everything will be fine' soon. Now is the last chance for all lawbreakers to reform." Gao Shigang from the Public Security Department of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region wrote: "These two documents embody the government's policy of combining severity with leniency and combining transformation with punishment. It once again tells lawbreakers: they should quickly choose the bright road of confession; those who do not confess will be severely punished." Wang Junming wrote: "With these two documents, we can more guaranteed to defeat the crazy attacks of the bourgeoisie and consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship."
    In the readers' letters, they unanimously stated: they must correctly grasp these two weapons, continue to adhere to the struggle, strive for the complete victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and lay the foundation for our future production increase, economy and national construction.

    政务院公布的两大文件
    鼓舞了各地人民“打虎”斗志
    ——读者来信综述
    本报读者纷纷来信拥护政务院公布的中央节约检查委员会“关于处理贪污、浪费及克服官僚主义错误的若干规定”和北京市人民政府“在‘五反’运动中关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法”两个文件。
    河北省高阳县节约检查委员会办公室郭宗尧、任谷风、蒋丙林等来信说：“学习了这两个文件后，我们的认识提高了一步。许多贪污分子的顾虑也解除了。有的贪污分子说，‘一定要转变以前不老实的态度，向人民交代自己的问题’。有的贪污分子在学习会上，当场坦白了自己的贪污罪行或以前的欺骗行为。”北京市邮局陈步湘来信说：“本局的工作人员普遍学习了这两个文件，许多贪污分子根据文件的规定，联系自己贪污行为，继续交代问题；有的表示，要尽速退赃，戴罪立功。这两个文件，大大地鼓舞了我们‘打虎’的斗志。”
    北京市第五四六工厂职工业余学校张钧来信说：
    “从这两个文件，我深刻地体会到人民政府对于一切真诚坦白的贪污分子是多么宽大。一切抗拒坦白的贪污分子和盗窃犯，应该清醒头脑，不要再梦想钻空子，梦想‘运动就要过去’，很快就‘没事’了。现在是一切违法分子改过自新的最后的机会。”内蒙古自治区人民政府公安部高士刚来信说：“这两个文件，体现了政府严肃与宽大相结合、改造与惩治相结合的方针。它又一次告诉违法分子：应该赶快选择坦白的光明道路；不坦白的必将受到严惩。”王俊明来信说：“我们有了这两个文件，能够更有保证地战胜资产阶级的猖狂进攻，巩固我们人民民主专政的阵营。”
    读者来信中，一致表示：要正确地掌握这两个武器，继续坚持斗争，争取“三反”和“五反”运动的彻底胜利，为我们今后的增产节约和国家建设打下基础。
