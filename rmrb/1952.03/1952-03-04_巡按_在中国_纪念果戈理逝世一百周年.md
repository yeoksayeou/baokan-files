    "The Inspector General" in China
    —Commemorating the Centenary of Gogol's Death
    Chen Baichen
    In 1935, when Mr. Lu Xun discussed the landlords of Great Russia depicted in the first part of "Dead Souls," he said, "The characters created are truly vivid! Even now, though times and countries are different, they still make us feel as if we've met some familiar figures." This is the social root of the widespread love and respect that the great Russian genius writer Gogol enjoys among the Chinese people. And if this explanation by Mr. Lu Xun is applied to another brilliant work of this realist master, "The Inspector General" (or "The Government Inspector"), it would be equally, or even more, appropriate. The comedic theme that the author captured from a small town on the distant, ancient border of old Russia not only proved its sharp and profound exposure of the autocracy and corruption of the entire bureaucracy of old Russia by provoking widespread anger and attacks from the entire officialdom of old Russia, but also proved, from the fervent love of people all over the world, especially the Chinese people, for it, that the ugly faces of reactionary rulers all over the world were sketched by the great writer's mighty pen, and were particularly similar to the faces of Chinese officials.
    In old China, not to mention the distant past, from the reactionary Manchu dynasty to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the entire ruling class was a bandit group that was autocratic, shameless, corrupt, incompetent, extorting, and openly accepting bribes. When Mr. Geng Jizhi introduced the first Chinese translation of "The Inspector General" to China thirty years ago, the Chinese people saw Mayor Anton Antonovich, saw the rogue swindler Khlestakov, saw the police chief, the judge, the postmaster, etc., and as Mr. Lu Xun said: "It was like meeting some familiar figures." From then on, the writer Gogol became beloved by the Chinese people!
    Gogol gave the oppressed Chinese people of that time a force of resistance. To relentlessly expose and ridicule the autocratic and brutal enemy is also a heavy blow to the enemy. This laughter, in Mr. Lu Xun's words, when it reached the faces of the Chinese people, was no longer a "tearful smile" but a healthy laugh. This laughter, just as it helped the Russian people recognize the bureaucratic politics under their Tsarist rule and fight against it, also played a certain role in the struggle of the Chinese people against the reactionary rulers since the Northern Warlords.
    This effect is strongly reflected in the Chinese people's love for this play – especially its publication and performance.
    Regarding the translation of this masterpiece, there have been more than three different translations published in China, including the translation by Mr. Geng Jizhi mentioned above. This does not include the scripts used on the stage, nor the bilingual versions used for language textbooks. The large number of different translations not only shows the universal love of Chinese intellectuals for it, and students even used it as a language textbook, but also shows that due to the difficulty of making the translated text colloquial, each translator attempted to make his version more suitable for stage performance. Because they knew that the Chinese people were eager to see those Anton Antonoviches and Khlestakovs, etc., "familiar figures," not only on paper, but also to be exposed in their true colors on the stage.
    Therefore, ninety-nine years after the comedy was first performed in St. Petersburg and Moscow, in the spring and summer of 1935, it met the Chinese people for the first time on the stage in Shanghai. This performance was an unprecedented success. The success was reflected on the one hand in the large number of spectators and their enthusiastic love, and this performance won a certain number of audiences for the Chinese drama stage, laying the foundation for later professional performances. Because before that, our drama performances were still limited to a very small number of intellectual audiences. But the most important aspect of the success was not this.
    Shanghai in 1935 was the darkest place in the dark years of the Kuomintang's rule. The Kuomintang was then kowtowing to Japanese imperialism and carrying out massacres and suppression against the Chinese people. The Chinese Left-Wing Dramatists League, which was formed in Shanghai, had long been devastated and suppressed, actors were arrested, theater groups were closed down, and the drama of the Chinese people was strangled to near silence. But Chinese drama workers did not retreat, they used a new strategy, that is, to give a fighting meaning to the performance of realist works of old Russia and Western Europe: in the selection of repertoires, they especially looked for those that could reflect similar life in China at that time, and looked for "familiar figures" to the Chinese people. And "The Inspector General" was the first object sought. Therefore, its performance helped the Chinese people, especially young intellectuals, to understand the bureaucratic politics of China and to recognize their current enemies. Because they had already replaced the Russian-style surnames of Anton Antonovich and others in their minds with Chinese-style Zhang County Magistrate or Li County Magistrate.
    This strategy of introducing realist works of old Russia and Western Europe on the stage and giving them fighting meaning has been regarded as a tradition by Chinese drama workers who fought against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. From the War of Resistance Against Japan to before the liberation of all of China, whenever the Chiang Kai-shek bandits exposed their reactionary nature and attacked the people, such as after the Southern Anhui Incident in 1941, "The Inspector General" appeared again on our stage. Therefore, during this period, major cities in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas such as Shanghai, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guilin, Nanjing, etc. repeatedly staged this great play, and the Chinese people welcomed each performance with new joy.
    While Chinese drama workers performed this masterpiece, they also carried out another work, which was the Sinicization of "The Inspector General." Because Russian customs and habits are not familiar to the general Chinese people, attempts to adapt this play into Chinese-style content for performance have been made more than once. And not only on the stage, but also the movie "Carnival Night" directed by Mr. Shi Dongshan was adapted from it. The number of viewers who contacted this movie even exceeded the multiple performances on the stage. One of my own exercises, "A Career Game," although its subject matter took place in a remote small county in Sichuan, I feel that it is too similar to what happened in the small town on the border of old Russia! More importantly, "A Career Game" was also irresistibly influenced by "The Inspector General" in style, which I cannot forget.
     "The Inspector General" and its author have such a deep and great relationship with the Chinese people, so it is not surprising that the Chinese people, especially the liberated Chinese people, have the same love and respect for this great genius and all his precious literary heritage as the Soviet people. And this love and respect will inevitably become universal among the people of the world with the cultural exchanges between countries!

    “巡按”在中国
    ——纪念果戈理逝世一百周年
    陈白尘
    一九三五年，鲁迅先生谈到“死魂灵”第一部所描写的大俄罗斯地主时，曾说：“那创作出来的脚色，可真是生动极了！直到现在，纵使时代不同，国度不同，也还使我们像是遇见了有些熟识的人物。”这就是伟大的俄罗斯天才作家果戈理在中国人民当中获得普遍热爱和尊重的社会根源。而鲁迅先生的这一解释，如果引用在这位现实主义巨匠的另一辉煌制作“巡按”即“钦差大臣”上面，那也同样地甚至是更加恰当。作者从旧俄罗斯辽远的、古老的边境上一个小镇里所捕捉到的这个喜剧题材，不仅由于引起了旧俄罗斯整个官场的普遍愤怒和攻击而证明了它是尖锐而深刻地暴露了旧俄罗斯整个官僚政治的专横和腐败，而且从全世界人民，特别是中国人民对它的狂热喜爱上，更证明了伟大作家的如椽之笔所勾画出来的是全世界反动统治者的丑恶脸谱，而特别相像于中国官僚的脸谱。
    在旧中国，远的不谈，单从反动的满清皇朝到蒋介石匪帮，整个统治阶级就是一个专横无耻、腐败无能、敲诈勒索、贿赂公行的强盗集团。当三十年以前，耿济之先生把“巡按”第一个翻译本介绍到中国的时候，中国人民看到了市长安东·安东诺维奇，看到了流氓骗棍赫莱斯达阔夫，看到了警察署长、推事、邮政局长等等，也正如鲁迅先生所说的：“像是遇见了有些熟识的人物”了。从此，作家果戈理就成为中国人民所热爱的人！
    果戈理给予当时被压迫的中国人民以一种反抗的力量。对专横残暴的敌人加以无情的揭露和嘲笑，也就是对敌人的一种沉重打击。这种笑，用鲁迅先生的说法，传到中国人民的脸上，就不再是“含泪的微笑”，而是健康的笑了。这种笑，也正如帮助了俄国人民认清他们的沙皇统治下的官僚政治，并向之进行战斗，同样也在中国人民对北洋军阀以来的反动统治者所进行的斗争中起了一定的作用。
    这种作用，单从中国人民对于这一剧作的喜爱——特别是它的出版和演出上获得了强烈的反映。
    在对于这一巨著的翻译工作上，在中国，包括上述耿济之先生的译本在内，已出版的就有三种以上的不同译本。而作为舞台上应用的台本还不在内，作为语文读本之用的对照本也没计算。这不同的译本之多，不仅仅表示着中国的知识分子对于它的普遍热爱，学生们甚至拿它作为语文课本，而且表示着由于翻译文字口语化的困难，而每一个翻译者都有企图把他的本子更适用于舞台上的演出。因为他们知道中国人民是渴望看着那些安东·安东诺维奇和赫莱斯达阔夫等等“有些熟识的人物”不仅在纸上，而且在舞台上原形毕露。
    因之，在距离这个喜剧初次上演于彼得堡和莫斯科之后的九十九年，即一九三五年的春夏之交，它第一次在上海的舞台上和中国人民见面了。这次演出获得了空前的成功。这个成功一方面表现在观众数量之多和热烈的喜爱上，由于这次演出，为中国话剧舞台争取到一定数量的观众，为后来职业性的演出打下基础。因为在此以前，我们的话剧演出还停留在极少数知识分子观众身上。而成功的最主要的一面还不在此。
    一九三五年的上海，是国民党统治区黑暗年代里的黑暗的地方。国民党那时正向日本帝国主义屈膝投降而对中国人民进行屠杀和镇压。在上海组成的中国左翼戏剧家联盟早遭到摧残和压迫，演员们被逮捕，戏剧团体被封闭，中国人民的戏剧被扼杀得近于无声了。但中国戏剧工作者们没有退缩，他们使用了一种新的战略，就是在演出旧俄和西欧的现实主义作品里，赋予一种战斗的意义：在剧目的选择里，特别找寻那些能够反映类似当时中国生活的，找寻那些对中国人民“有些熟识的人物”的。而“巡按”便是被找寻的第一个对象。因此，它的演出，是帮助了中国人民特别是青年知识分子认识了中国的官僚政治，认识了自己当前的敌人。因为他们已经把安东·安东诺维奇这些俄罗斯式的姓氏在自己的思想里换上中国式的张知县、或李县长了。
    这种在舞台上介绍旧俄和西欧现实主义作品而赋予战斗意义的战略，一直被和蒋匪帮斗争着的中国戏剧工作者当作了一种传统。从抗日战争期间，一直到全中国解放以前，每当蒋匪帮一暴露其反动原形而向人民进攻的时候，比如一九四一年皖南事变之后，我们的舞台上就又出现了“巡按”，所以在这期间，蒋管区的上海、重庆、成都、桂林、南京等等大城市都又一再上演这一伟大剧作，而中国人民对于每一次演出又都以新的喜悦来欢迎它。
    中国戏剧工作者和上演这一巨著的同时，还进行了另一种工作，那就是“巡按”的中国化。由于俄罗斯式风俗习惯不能为一般中国人民所熟悉，改编这部剧作成为中国式的内容而演出的尝试也不止一次。而且不仅于在舞台上，史东山先生导演的电影“狂欢之夜”，就是根据它所改编。这部电影在接触观众的数量上更超过了舞台上的多次演出。笔者自己的习作之一——“升官图”，它的题材虽然发生在四川的一个僻远的小县城里，但我觉得和旧俄罗斯边疆小镇上所发生的未免太相似了！而更重要的是“升官图”在风格上也受了“巡按”的不可抗拒的影响，这一点是我所不能忘怀的。
     “巡按”及其作者对于中国人民的关系如此之既深且巨，这就不会奇怪，中国人民，尤其是解放了的中国人民对于这位伟大的天才及其全部宝贵的文学遗产怀着和苏联人民一样的热爱与尊敬。而这种热爱与尊敬，必然地随着各国人民间的文化交流而将普遍到全世界人民中间去！
