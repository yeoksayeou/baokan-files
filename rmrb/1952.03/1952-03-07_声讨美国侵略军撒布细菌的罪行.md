    Denouncing the Crime of the American Aggressor Troops Spreading Bacteria
    Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
    The American aggressor troops in the rear of Korea have incessantly and crazily burned houses and forests and bombed and massacred large numbers of Korean women and children in the past. This heinous crime has long been intolerable to the world's just public opinion. Recently, they have intensified their efforts and used airplanes to spread bacteria in Korea, attempting to poison the people in the rear of Korea. As everyone knows, germ warfare is the most inhumane and shameful method of killing people. As early as the 1925 Geneva Conference, countries around the world signed a convention prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons. The US government established the Biological Warfare Committee in 1943 and built a bacterial research institute at Fort Detrick in Maryland. Ostensibly, it aimed to defend against enemy germ warfare, but in reality, it was tasked with manufacturing various biological weapons, such as germs and viruses, to destroy agricultural products and kill people. At one point, the number of staff in the camp reached 2,900, which shows the scale of this killing factory. Biological knowledge can be used to increase production, reduce immunity to disease, and create happiness for the people, but when it falls into the hands of American warmongers, it becomes a deadly weapon. Since January 28 of this year, the American aggressor troops, frustrated by their repeated failures on the front lines, have妄想 to use germ warfare to salvage their inevitable defeat, and have continuously撒细菌毒虫 over Korea. This heinous and extremely sinful act has aroused unanimous condemnation from people all over the world who love justice. The people of our country are even more filled with righteous indignation. Medical and health science personnel in our country recently formed a volunteer anti-American aid Korea epidemic prevention inspection team, and the first batch has flown to Korea to do epidemic prevention and inspection work. The number of health science personnel who will volunteer to go to Korea will inevitably surge. This is the highest and most sincere expression of patriotism and internationalism by our scientific workers. We will certainly be able to extinguish the灭绝人道的 towering crime of the American aggressor troops and make them ultimately fail.

    声讨美国侵略军撒布细菌的罪行
    中国科学院副院长  竺可桢
    美国侵略军在朝鲜后方，过去曾不绝地疯狂地燃烧房屋森林和轰炸残杀大批朝鲜妇孺，这种滔天罪行，久已为世界公正舆论所不容。近更变本加厉，以飞机在朝鲜撒布细菌，企图毒害朝鲜后方人民。众所周知：细菌战争，是一种最不人道、最可耻的杀人手段。早在一九二五年日内瓦会议，世界各国曾订立禁止运用细菌武器的公约。而美国政府于一九四三年即成立生物作战委员会，在玛利兰省的迪特瑞克营建设细菌研究所。名义上以防御敌人的细菌战为目的，实际却以制造各种生物武器，如病菌病毒等，以毁灭农产品、杀害人生为任务。营中工作人员，一度曾达二千九百人，此杀人厂规模之大可知。生物学上的知识本可用以增加生产，减免疫病，为人民谋幸福，但一到美国战争贩子手中，便成为杀人利器。从本年一月二十八日以来，美侵略军以前线的着着失败，妄想以细菌战来挽回其不可避免的挫败，不断地在朝鲜上空撒细菌毒虫，这等惨无人道罪大恶极的行为，已引起了全世界爱好正义人士的一致声讨。我全国人民更莫不义愤填膺。我医药卫生科学界人士，最近组成了抗美援朝志愿防疫检验队，第一批已飞往朝鲜做防疫检验工作。继起志愿前往朝鲜的卫生科学界人士，必将风起云涌。这是我们科学工作人员爱国主义、国际主义的最高尚、最热诚的表现。必能扑灭美国侵略军灭绝人道的滔天罪恶，而使之终归于失败。
