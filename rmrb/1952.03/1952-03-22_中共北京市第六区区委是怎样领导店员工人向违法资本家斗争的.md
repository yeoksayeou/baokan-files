    The Sixth District Committee of the CCP Beijing Municipal Committee, in the anti-embezzlement movement, clearly put forward and implemented the policy of relying on the broad masses of shop employees and uniting with and winning over senior shop employees, launched a fierce struggle with illegal capitalists, and guided the movement to gradually move towards victory.
    Beijing's Sixth District is an area with a concentration of industry and commerce in the city. There are more than 9,000 industrial and commercial households in the entire district, accounting for one-fifth of the industrial and commercial households in Beijing's urban area. There are more than 20,000 shop employees in the entire district, accounting for one-third of the total number of shop employees in the city. After liberation, under the education of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the vast number of shop employees gradually established a sense of ownership. More than half of the shop employees joined the trade union. However, because in the past there was no universal, systematic, and in-depth education for shop employees, a considerable number of shop employees have not yet shaken off the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie; the organizational foundation of the Party among shop employees is quite weak, with only a few branches in the bathhouse, food, printing, and iron industries. This situation shows that to successfully carry out the anti-embezzlement struggle, it is necessary to rely on shop employees; and to rely well on shop employees, it is necessary to first carry out class education.
    (I)
    In order to successfully carry out the anti-embezzlement movement, the Sixth District Committee of the CCP, based on the overall situation of the Sixth District, especially the ideological situation of shop employees, clearly proposed to first conduct class education for shop employees, in order to draw a clear line between the working class and the bourgeoisie, and to improve the political level of shop employees through struggle. To this end, Party organizations, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League convened various meetings to explain the significance of the anti-embezzlement movement, explained the situation of the bourgeoisie's attack on the working class, and the serious harm this attack caused to the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, to national economic construction, and to the people's lives, and called on Party members to first examine their own thoughts in order to draw a clear line with bourgeois ideology. Wang Ruxian, the secretary of the CCP branch of Yipinxiang Bathhouse, said when reviewing his own erroneous thoughts: "My past thinking was very vague. I thought that capitalists take money to do business just to make a profit, and they wouldn't do it if they didn't make a profit. Now I realize that it is permissible for capitalists to make money, but it should be restricted, and they should abide by national policies and laws, and should not be solely profit-oriented, harm others and benefit oneself, engage in speculation, and illegally steal the property of the state and the people. But these illegal capitalists will do anything bad as long as there is money to be made." Zhao Jinglin, a Party member of the private Daxing Electric Motor Factory, used to have a one-sided view of developing production. Whenever labor-capital disputes occurred, he would explain to the workers: "We must plan for the long term. In order to improve production, we should sacrifice a little ourselves." Now, he realizes that this idea is wrong, because relying solely on "tolerance" can only encourage the rampant attacks of illegal capitalists. After ideological examination, Party members' thinking was corrected, and then, using the experience of solving their own ideological problems, combined with the illegal facts of the capitalists in their own stores, they educated the shop employees. After two or three days of work, the masses were initially mobilized, and more than 300 reports of capitalists' illegal acts were made. At this time, the District Committee convened a meeting of Party members and grassroots trade union cadres, and put forward the policy of combining the immediate interests of shop employees to conduct in-depth class education, in order to consolidate the existing achievements of ideological education and further mobilize shop employees. After the meeting, the Sixth District Committee, through various industry trade unions, held various small training classes (such as accounting training classes, apprentice training classes, and shop employee training classes) with a term of three days. In these training classes, some shop employees and apprentices were mobilized to recall and accuse illegal capitalists of their oppression, which had a huge educational effect on the vast number of shop employees. In the winter of 1949, Mu Shaofu, the manager of Dongshengping Bathhouse, used eighty bolts of cloth to buy off Liu Yinzhang, the secretary of the CCP branch of the bathhouse, and asked Liu Yinzhang to help him lay off workers. Liu Yinzhang betrayed the interests of the Party and the working class and helped the capitalists lay off eighty-three workers. As a result, he himself was eventually fired by the capitalists, and the eighty bolts of cloth were only an unfulfilled "IOU". The Party organization discovered Liu Yinzhang's betrayal and expelled him from the Party. This painful lesson helped shop employees further recognize the essence of illegal capitalists. Some shop employees said: "We workers sincerely negotiate with the capitalists in order to improve production; but illegal capitalists are beasts in human clothing, and they want to harm us everywhere." Some shop employees said: "The bourgeoisie is always opposed to us. After the liberation of Beijing, the People's Government loaned money to help them, but illegal capitalists have lost their conscience, evaded taxes, sought exorbitant profits, violated national economic policies, and undermined national economic construction." At this time, the class consciousness of shop employees was raised, and many shop employees wanted to report illegal capitalists, but they still had many ideological concerns: some shop employees were relatives and friends with the capitalists, and they couldn't bear to tear up the relationship; some shop employees were afraid that the capitalists' businesses would collapse and their jobs would be lost. This was a new problem, and if this problem was not solved, the movement could not move forward. Based on these circumstances, the Sixth District Committee decided that the Sixth District Trade Union should convene a district-wide shop employee representative meeting. At this meeting, the capitalists' so-called kinship and friendship with the workers were exposed, and it was pointed out that: unscrupulous merchants do not recognize relatives among workers and do not speak of friendship or integrity. Some illegal capitalists unscrupulously harmed our "most beloved people." Isn't it shameful to be relatives and friends with these illegal capitalists? At the same time, it was clearly announced at the meeting that the anti-embezzlement struggle was just, that the People's Government fully supported the shop employees, and that shop employees would not lose their jobs because of reporting unscrupulous merchants. This dispelled the shop employees' last concerns. In a month and a half, the vast number of shop employees reported 4,783 cases of capitalists' illegal acts. Among them, there were 53 cases of tax evasion and theft of state property exceeding 100 million yuan. The workers of Guangdaxingji Grain Store sent the capitalists' false accounts to the trade union.
    (II)
    However, although the materials generally mastered by shop employees and apprentices were numerous, they often lacked key elements. The most hidden and most fatal materials of the unscrupulous merchants were generally in the hands of senior shop employees such as accountants and runners. If this group of people was not mobilized, the "fortress" of the unscrupulous merchants would not be easily completely broken. In order to break through this final barrier, the District Committee clearly put forward the task of doing a good job in uniting senior shop employees.
    Senior shop employees have a closer relationship with the capitalists, and they have a stronger desire to climb up the social ladder. Some of them even have shares in the store. Therefore, some senior shop employees even said: "I am neither a capitalist nor a worker." In order to awaken their class consciousness, the Sixth District Committee carried out a series of work, with Party members and trade union cadres talking to them individually, holding symposiums and grievance meetings, and organizing training classes, repeatedly explaining the principle that shop employees and workers are one family. At the same time, enlightening education was carried out, explaining what class is, how class is produced, what the laws of social development are, where China will go in the future, the working class must draw a clear line with the bourgeoisie, and do not be deceived or fooled by capitalists, etc. In addition, the apprentice's grievance meetings also played a huge educational role. Because most senior shop employees have risen from apprenticeships, the apprentices' grievances aroused their painful memories of their past apprenticeship lives, and their gradually fading class consciousness was slowly awakened. Hao Benchu, the accountant of Yihexiang Silk and Cloth Store, said: "We accountants are the capitalists' keys. Now our working class must master this key, open the cabinets of illegal capitalists, and expose their ugly faces." Luo Hai, the accountant of Fujian Chun Tea Shop, was originally the director of the grassroots trade union committee, but was later bought off by the capitalist. After this study, he realized his past mistakes and tore off the mask to expose the illegal facts of the store manager selling rough tea as good tea and seeking exorbitant profits. He also introduced his experience of being used by the capitalist and his ideological transformation process at a symposium of accountants in the same industry, helping everyone to distinguish right from wrong, eliminate concerns, and report the illegal acts of capitalists.
    Using the criminal facts of illegal capitalists to educate senior shop employees and make them recognize the true face of the bourgeoisie is helpful to quickly draw a clear class line. The frankness struggle meeting is a good form for exposing the true face of the bourgeoisie. The Sixth District Committee put forward the battle slogan of "seizing the pigtails, tearing up the face, and universally burning the mountain to catch tigers," and led the vast number of shop employees to launch a face-to-face struggle with illegal capitalists. In the face-to-face struggle, senior shop employees were absorbed as much as possible, which was a good exercise for them. During the anti-embezzlement movement, the Sixth District held three district-wide frankness struggle conferences. Through these struggle conferences, policies were publicized and shop employees were educated. Qin Wenming, the manager of Fuyuanhou, secretly sold dried sea cucumbers that had been mortgaged to the bank, but did not ask the accountant to record it. Xing Mengqi, the accountant, insisted on the correct opinion and wrote a note on the account. Qin Wenming held a grudge and attempted to kill Xing Mengqi, but fortunately he was discovered by the workers and Xing Mengqi was not killed. The conference thoroughly exposed Qin Wenming's crimes, and the People's Government accepted the workers' request and arrested Qin Wenming on the spot. The iron facts completely shattered the erroneous thinking of some senior shop employees who believed that "the capitalist promoted me to be an accountant, which is really a life-saving grace." It turned out that unscrupulous merchants were smiling on the face but ruthless in their hearts. Gao Dagang, the accountant of Tongfeng Sugar Store, after being educated by these specific facts, suddenly realized and took the initiative to expose the illegal facts of the store manager Lu Bingguang stealing state property. Lu Bingguang joined eight sugar stores to manipulate the market and seek exorbitant profits. His personal illegal profits and tax evasion amounted to as much as 2.2 billion yuan (Lu Bingguang has been arrested). This amazing number further educated Gao Dagang and also educated all senior shop employees.
    Many enlightened senior shop employees participated in the "shock brigade" organized by the District Committee and assisted the inspection team in attacking unscrupulous merchants who refused to confess. They were familiar with the business, knew the inside story, and understood the means and methods used by unscrupulous merchants. Therefore, many stubborn "fortresses" were broken down by them one by one.
    After the senior shop employees were mobilized, the momentum of counterattacking illegal capitalists finally formed, and more than 6,000 criminal facts of illegal capitalists were quickly reported. It was impossible for some illegal capitalists to muddle through.
    Through the anti-corruption and anti-embezzlement movement, the awareness of shop employees in the Sixth District has generally improved. The trade union organization has been further consolidated and expanded. As of now, the trade unions in various industries in the Sixth District have developed 2,149 members and 21 Communist Youth League members. The trade union in the hardware industry had very few members in the past, but it has now expanded by one-third.

    中共北京市第六区区委是怎样领导店员工人向违法资本家斗争的
    赵培蓝
    中共北京市第六区区委会在反盗窃运动中明确地提出并且贯彻实行了依靠广大店员、团结争取高级店员的方针，和违法资本家展开了激烈的斗争，引导运动逐步走向胜利。
    北京市第六区是全市工商业集中的区域。全区共有工商户九千多户，占北京市城区工商户的五分之一。全区共有店员两万多人，占全市店员总数的三分之一。解放后，广大店员工人在共产党和人民政府的教育下，逐步树立了主人翁的思想。半数以上的店员参加了工会。但是，由于过去没有对店员工人进行普遍、系统、深入的教育，所以还有相当一部分店员工人，没有摆脱资产阶级的思想影响；党的组织基础在店员中相当薄弱，只有浴塘业、食品业、印刷业、铁工业中有几个支部。这种情况说明，要胜利地开展反盗窃斗争，必须依靠店员工人；而要很好地依靠店员工人，必须首先进行阶级教育。
    （一）
    为了胜利地开展反盗窃运动，中共六区区委根据六区的整个情况特别是店员工人的思想情况，明确提出首先对店员进行阶级教育，以便划清工人阶级和资产阶级的界限，从斗争中提高店员的政治水平。为此，党组织、工会、青年团曾分别召开了各种会议，讲解了反盗窃运动的意义，说明了资产阶级向工人阶级进攻的情况，以及这种进攻对于抗美援朝，对于国家经济建设，对于人民生活的严重危害，号召党员首先检查自己的思想，以便和资产阶级思想划清界限。一品香澡塘中共支部书记王汝贤检讨自己的错误思想时说：“我过去的思想是很模糊的。我认为资本家拿钱做买卖，就是为了赚点，不赚钱就不干了。现在我认识了资本家赚钱虽是允许的，但应当受限制，应当遵守国家的政策法令，不应当唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧，非法盗窃国家人民的资财。可是这些违法资本家只要有钱可赚，什么坏事都干出来了。”私营大兴电机厂党员赵景林，过去有一种片面的发展生产的观点，每逢发生劳资纠纷，他就向工人解释：“要作长远打算，为了搞好生产，自己应该牺牲一点。”现在，他认识了这种思想是错误的，因为单靠“忍让”只能助长违法资本家的猖狂进攻。经过思想检查，党员的思想端正了，再用解决自己思想问题的经验，结合本店资本家的违法事实，教育店员。经两三天的工作，群众初步发动了起来，检举资本家的违法行为达三百多件。这时，区委召开了党员和基层工会的干部会议，提出结合店员的切身利益，进行深入的阶级教育的方针，以巩固现有的思想教育的成果，并进一步发动店员。会后，六区区委通过各个行业工会，举办了三天一期的各种小型训练班（如会计训练班、学徒训练班、店员训练班）。在这些训练班中，发动一部分店员、学徒、回忆并控诉了违法资本家对自己的压迫，这对广大店员工人发生了极大的教育作用。一九四九年冬天，东升平澡塘经理慕绍甫，用八十匹布收买了该塘中共支部书记刘寅章，让刘寅章帮助他解雇工人。刘寅章背叛了党和工人阶级的利益，帮助资本家解雇了八十三个工人，结果他自己最后也被资方开除了，八十匹布仅只是一个不兑现的“欠条”。党的组织发现了刘寅章的背叛行为，把他开除出党。这个沉痛的教训，帮助店员工人进一步认识了违法资本家的本质。有的店员说：“我们工人诚心诚意地和资本家协商，是为了搞好生产；可是违法资本家人面兽心，处处想陷害我们。”有的店员说：“资产阶级总是和我们对立的。北京解放后，人民政府曾贷款帮助他们，违法资本家们却丧尽天良，偷税漏税，牟取暴利，违反国家经济政策，破坏国家经济建设。”这时店员工人们的阶级觉悟提高了，许多店员工人都想检举违法资本家，但是他们还有不少思想顾虑：有些店员和资方是亲戚、朋友，撕不破脸；有些店员害怕资本家的买卖垮了，自己的职业保不住。这是一个新问题，如果不解决这个问题，运动就不能前进。六区区委根据这些情况，决定由六区工会召开全区店员代表会。在这个会上揭穿了资本家对工人的所谓亲戚、朋友的虚假的关系，指出：奸商对工人是六亲不认，是不讲朋友信义的。违法资本家中有些人肆无忌惮地暗害我们“最可爱的人”，和这些违法资本家作亲戚，讲朋友，难道不是很可耻的吗？同时，在会上明确宣布，反盗窃斗争是正义的，人民政府全力给店员撑腰，保证店员不会因检举奸商而失业。这就打消了店员最后的顾虑。在一个半月中间，广大店员检举了资本家违法行为四千七百八十三件。其中偷税漏税，盗窃国家资财在一亿元以上的，有五十三件。广达兴记粮栈的工人，把资本家的假账都送到工会去了。
    （二）
    但是，一般店员、学徒掌握的材料，虽然数量很多，却常常缺乏要害部分。奸商最隐蔽最致命的材料，一般是掌握在会计、跑外等高级店员手里。如果不把这批人发动起来，奸商的“堡垒”是不易完全攻破的。为了突破这最后的一关，区委明确地提出了作好团结高级店员工作的任务。
    高级店员和资本家的关系较密切，向上爬的思想较重，有的在店里还有些股份。因此，部分高级店员竟然说：“我不是资本家，也不是工人。”为了唤起他们的阶级觉悟，六区区委进行了一连串的工作，由党员、工会干部和他们个别谈话，召开座谈会、诉苦会，举办训练班，反复讲解店员工人是一家的道理。同时进行启发教育，讲解什么是阶级，阶级是怎样产生的，社会发展规律是什么，今后我国要走到那里去，工人阶级必须和资产阶级划清界限，不要受资本家欺骗，不要上当等等。另外，学徒的诉苦会也发挥了巨大的教育作用。因为大多数高级店员都是由学徒升起来的，学徒们的诉苦，引起他们对于过去的学徒生活的痛苦回忆，他们那日渐淡漠的阶级意识，慢慢地被唤醒了。益和祥绸布店会计郝本初说：“我们作会计的，就是资本家的钥匙。现在我们工人阶级要掌握这把钥匙，把违法资本家的柜子打开，把他们的丑恶面目亮出来。”福建春茶庄会计罗海，原是基层工会委员会的主任，后被资本家收买了。经过这次学习，他认识了过去的错误，撕破脸皮揭露了本店经理将草茶当好茶卖、牟取暴利的违法事实。他并且在同行业会计座谈会上，介绍了他被资本家利用的经过和思想转变过程，帮助大家明辨是非，消除顾虑，检举资本家的违法行为。
    用违法资本家的犯罪事实，教育高级店员，使他们认识资产阶级的真面目，是有助于迅速划清阶级界限的。坦白斗争会是揭露资产阶级真面目的良好形式。六区区委提出了“抓住辫子撕破脸，普遍烧山捉老虎”的战斗口号，领导广大店员，和违法资本家展开了面对面的斗争。在面对面的斗争中，尽量吸收高级店员参加，这对他们是一种很好的锻炼。在反盗窃运动中，六区开过三次全区性的坦白斗争大会，通过这些斗争会，宣传政策，教育店员工人。复元厚经理秦文明，偷卖已经押给银行的干海参，但不叫会计记账。会计邢孟奇坚持正确意见，在账上写了一笔。秦文明怀恨在心，企图砍死邢孟奇，幸被工人发觉，邢孟奇没有被害。大会彻底揭发了秦文明的罪行，人民政府接受工人的要求，当场将秦文明逮捕。铁的事实，完全把某些高级店员认为“资本家提拔我当会计，真是活命恩人”的错误思想打破了。原来奸商是笑在脸上，狠在心里的。同丰糖庄会计高达刚，经过这些具体事实的教育后，恍然大悟，主动地揭发了本店经理卢炳光盗窃国家资财的违法事实。卢炳光联合八家糖庄，操纵市场，牟取暴利。他个人获得的非法利润和偷税漏税即达二十二亿元之多（卢炳光已被逮捕）。这一惊人数字，进一步教育了高达刚，也教育了所有的高级店员。
    许多觉悟了的高级店员，参加了区委领导组织的
    “突击队”，协助检查组，攻击死不坦白的奸商。他们熟悉业务，知道底细，了解奸商使用的手段和办法，因此，许多顽固的“堡垒”，都被他们次第攻破了。
    高级店员动起来以后，向违法资本家反攻的阵势最后形成，很快地检举了违法资本家六千多件犯罪事实。有些违法资本家想混过关去，已经是不可能的了。
    经过反贪污反盗窃运动，六区店员工人的觉悟普遍地提高了。工会组织更加巩固，并且扩大了。截至目前止，六区各行业工会已发展了二千一百四十九名会员，二十一名青年团员。五金行业工会的会员过去很少，现已扩大了三分之一。
