Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: The American aggressors, who have committed heinous bacteriological warfare in Korea, have frantically made many contradictory sophistries and shamelessly fabricated rumors in the face of the unanimous condemnation of peace-loving people all over the world, attempting to cover up their crimes. However, this stupid act by the murderous and aggressive American robbers has only further exposed their ugly faces as the most despicable swindlers and ruffians in front of the people of the world.

After the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Park Heon-young, and the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Enlai, successively issued statements on February 22nd and 24th protesting the American government's conduct of bacteriological warfare, the American aggressors, with a guilty conscience, dared not speak out until the 25th and "did not comment at all" (Associated Press). Afterwards, realizing that silence could not cover up their obvious crimes, they resorted to the clumsy trick of simply denying everything. On the 26th, "a responsible official" of the U.S. Eighth Army declared to reporters from International News Service that the American invading army "has not conducted bacteriological warfare" in the Korean War. On the 27th, Ridgway's headquarters, in addition to flatly denying it, shamelessly slandered our accusation of the American aggressors' conduct of bacteriological warfare as "lies." At the same time, the American news agencies and Ridgway's radio station, "Voice of the United Nations Command," echoed the propaganda like parrots. However, it was clear that no matter how the American aggressors tried to deny it, it was not enough to quell the righteous anger of the people of the world, especially the people of their so-called allied countries, at this atrocity. Therefore, on March 4th, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson had to personally step forward and make a statement of denial. He could not and did not offer any refuting evidence to deny the specific facts we presented about the American aggressors' conduct of bacteriological warfare. He had to brazenly say: "We don't need to deny it again." "These accusations are completely untrue. The United Nations forces have not conducted and are not conducting any bacteriological warfare."

However, this denial by the American aggressors, without offering any arguments, this low-level denial like a captured habitual thief with bloody crimes insisting that he is not a robber, obviously did not help. Therefore, the American aggressors had to resort to their usual trick of fabricating rumors and slander. But since it was a rumor, it could not but be full of loopholes and expose its ugliness. On February 25th, the Associated Press fabricated a rumor, saying that the disaster caused by the American aggressors spreading germs was "an epidemic caused by natural causes." On February 26th, the International News Service published a false report saying that an official at Ridgway's headquarters said: "The Communists may be trying to find an excuse for the infectious diseases in their own army." However, the same International News Service report contradicted itself by reporting: "A spokesman said: 'There has been no increase in diseases in the Communist army.'" Another Seoul dispatch from the International News Service on the same day also said: A responsible officer of the Eighth Army said, "There is no indication of a large-scale plague in the Communist-controlled areas." Ridgway's propaganda machine, the "Voice of the United Nations Command," boringly repeated on the 27th that "the Communist side is trying to 'cover up' their inability to deal with internal infectious diseases." Acheson, in addition to flatly denying the American aggressors' crime of conducting bacteriological warfare, also shamelessly repeated this kind of nonsense, saying: "The Communists are unable to take care of the health of the people under their control, and the result seems to have caused a serious bubonic plague epidemic." But the International News Service, which was ordered to carry out this propaganda of rumors, gave Ridgway and even Acheson a resounding slap in the face. The agency admitted in a telegram on the 27th: "Although the 'Voice of the United Nations Command,' as an 'unofficial' broadcast from Ridgway's press office, said such things, some people in Tokyo generally do not believe the infectious disease story."

In fact, no lies or slanders can change the ironclad facts. When the American aggressors were making various shameless denials and sophistries, they were like a wolf dressed as grandma, unable to hide its tail after all. An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 1st quoted a report from Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British Daily Worker, saying that a Chinese People's Volunteer saw American planes dropping insects carrying germs with his own eyes. The Associated Press quickly tried to quibble, saying: "Allied forces found many flies and fleas on the mountainsides on their own side, but the Allied forces did not accuse them of being dropped by the Communist army." The overly clever American aggressors finally revealed their true colors here. Since the Associated Press cannot cite any facts to say that these flies and fleas were dropped by North Korean and Chinese planes, where did these flies and fleas carrying germs come from? Isn't it obvious that those technically unskilled American pilots who are used to dropping bombs as fuel tanks mistakenly dropped their targets in a hurry? At the same time, the American aggressors inadvertently revealed that as a result of their bacteriological warfare, epidemic diseases have occurred in areas of southern Korea near the front lines. A U.S. Information Service dispatch from Seoul on the 3rd said: Typhus had occurred in a small mountainous area "blocked by snow" and "almost isolated from the outside world." The American aggressors are so cowardly that they dare not even say the name of this place. Are these unintentional confessions not a powerful refutation of the American aggressors' heinous crime of conducting bacteriological warfare? What other way can the American aggressors use to justify themselves?

Now, people can see very clearly that the American aggressors' shameless trick of covering their ears and stealing the bell this time regarding the conduct of bacteriological warfare is nothing new. This is just the old trick that the American aggressors used last September. At that time, in order to obstruct the armistice negotiations, the U.S. side sent planes to continuously strafe and bomb the conference area of the armistice negotiations. At that time, the American aggressors also dared not admit it, denied it in every possible way, and even spat blood on people, saying that these were all incidents created by our side. However, later, in the face of the presence of both witnesses and material evidence, Ridgway had to shamelessly admit on September 11th that American planes had strafed the neutral zone. The American aggressors now vainly attempt to use the same shameless method of stealing the sky and changing the sun to shirk their heinous crime and serious responsibility of conducting criminal bacteriological warfare to expand the war. It is absolutely impossible to do so. They will surely be subjected to the just sanctions of peace-loving people all over the world!

### 进一步暴露骗子和流氓的丑恶面目  美国侵略者妄图狡赖撒布毒菌的滔天罪行

    进一步暴露骗子和流氓的丑恶面目
    美国侵略者妄图狡赖撒布毒菌的滔天罪行
    【新华社八日讯】在朝鲜进行罪恶滔天的细菌战的美国侵略者，在全世界爱好和平人民的一致声讨下，慌乱地作了许多矛盾百出的狡辩和厚颜无耻的造谣诬蔑，妄想掩饰自己的罪行。但是，美国这个嗜杀成性的侵略强盗的这种愚蠢作法，只是在全世界人民面前进一步暴露了它们同时又是最卑鄙无耻的骗子和流氓的丑恶面目。
    在朝鲜外务相朴宪永和我国外交部长周恩来于二月二十二日和二十四日先后发表了抗议美国政府进行细菌战的声明以后，直到二十五日为止，作贼心虚的美国侵略者不敢声辩，“一直没有发表评论”
    （美联社）。之后，鉴于沉默不能够掩盖其彰明较著的罪行，则采取了一味狡赖的拙劣伎俩。二十六日，美国第八军的“一位负责官员”出面向国际新闻社的记者声明美国侵略军在朝鲜战争中“并未进行细菌战”。二十七日，李奇微总部除了矢口抵赖以外，竟无耻污蔑我方对美国侵略者进行细菌战的控诉为“撒谎”。同时，美国通讯社和李奇微的电台“联合国军之音”即跟着进行了鹦鹉学舌似的宣传。但是，显然无论美国侵略者如何狡赖，都不足以平息全世界人民，特别是其所谓盟邦的人民对于这种暴行的正义愤怒，于是三月四日，美国国务卿艾奇逊不能不亲自出马，照样作了一个狡赖的声明，他对我方所提美国侵略者进行细菌战的具体事实，不可能也提不出任何否认的反证，只好厚着脸皮硬说：“我们原用不着再加以否认。”“这些指责是完全不真实的，联合国军过去未进行现在也未进行任何种细菌战。”
    但是，美国侵略者这种提不出任何论据的否认，这种像一个被捉住的血案累累的惯盗硬说自己不是强盗一类的低劣的抵赖，显然无济于事。于是，美国侵略者不得不求之于它们一贯造谣诬蔑的骗术了。但既然是谣言，就不能不漏洞百出，丑态毕露。美联社二月二十五日制造谣言，把美国侵略者撒布细菌所造成的灾害，说成是“自然原因造成的流行病”。美国国际新闻社二月二十六日发表了一个伪造的消息说，李奇微总部的官员说：“共产党可能正试图为它们自己军队中的传染病找藉口”。但是国际新闻社同一条消息却自相矛盾地报道：“一位发言人说：‘共军中的疾病未见有所增加’。”国际新闻社同日另一则汉城消息也说：第八军一位负责军官说，“现在没有迹象证明共军控制地区中发生大规模瘟疫”。李奇微的造谣机构“联合国军之音”于二十七日无聊地重复说什么“共方企图借此‘掩饰’他们无能对付内部的传染病”。艾奇逊除了矢口抵赖美国侵略军进行细菌战的罪行外，也同样无耻地重复这种谰言说：“共产党无力照顾他们控制下的人民的健康，其结果似乎已造成严重的鼠疫流行病。”但是奉命进行这种造谣宣传的国际新闻社却又给了李奇微以至艾奇逊之流一记响亮的耳光。该社二十七日电承认：“尽管‘联合国军之音’作为李奇微新闻处的‘非官方’广播说了这样的话，然而东京的某些人士大都不相信传染病的说法。”
    实际上，任何谎言和诬蔑都无法改变铁的事实，美国侵略者在进行各种无耻的抵赖、狡辩时，就像一只装作外婆的狼毕竟藏不好自己的尾巴。美国的合众社东京一日电引述了英国工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁敦的报道，说有一个志愿军人员亲眼看到美国飞机丢下带有病菌的昆虫。合众社即赶紧进行诡辩说：“联军部队在他们自己这一边的山边发现了许多苍蝇和跳蚤，但是联军并没有指责他们说是共军丢下的。”自作聪敏的美国侵略者在这里终究露出了马脚。既然合众社举不出任何事实来说这些苍蝇、跳蚤是朝中飞机投下的，那么这些带有毒菌的苍蝇、跳蚤从那里来的呢？这不显然是那些技术低劣、惯于把炸弹当作油箱投下来的美国飞行员们，在慌忙中误投了目标么？美国侵略者同时又不小心地透露了由于它们进行细菌战的结果，使朝鲜南部邻近前线的地方已发生了疫病。美国新闻处汉城三日的消息说：在一处被“雪塞住了道路”，“几乎与外界隔绝”的一片小山地发生了斑疹伤寒。美国侵略者如此贼胆心虚，甚至不敢说出这个地方的名称。这些无意中的招供不正是美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行的有力反证吗？美国侵略者还有什么办法再来自圆其说呢？
    现在，人们已经看得很清楚，美国侵略者这次对于进行细菌战所采取的掩耳盗铃的无耻伎俩，并没有什么新奇之处。这只是美国侵略者在去年九月间曾经使用过的旧花样。当时美方为了阻挠停战谈判，曾派遣飞机连续扫射轰炸停战谈判的会场地区。那时美国侵略者也同样不敢承认，一味抵赖，甚至含血喷人，说这都是我方自己制造出来的事件。可是后来在人证物证俱在的面前，李奇微不得不丑态百出地在九月十一日承认了美机扫射中立区的事实。美国侵略者现在妄想用同样偷天换日的无耻手法，来推卸自己进行罪恶的细菌战以扩大战争的滔天罪行和严重责任，是绝对办不到的，它们必将受到全世界爱好和平人民的正义制裁！
