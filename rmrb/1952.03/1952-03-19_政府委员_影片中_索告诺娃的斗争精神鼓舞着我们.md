    "Government Member" Film:
    Sokonova's Fighting Spirit Inspires Us
    Editor: You know how excited we were after watching the Soviet film "Government Member"! It gives us great strength. The fighting deeds of the film's protagonist, Sokonova, have strengthened our confidence in the victory of communism. Sokonova was originally an ordinary rural woman who was tortured by landlords and beaten by her husband. She grew up under the education and cultivation of the Party, grew up in struggle, overcame many difficulties, and finally achieved victory: building a backward rural area into a prosperous collective farm. She became an excellent chairman of the collective farm and was elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The path she took clearly tells us that only under the people's regime can women fully develop their talents, but this cannot be achieved without struggle; only through continuous struggle and overcoming all difficulties can women unleash their potential power. We must learn from Sokonova's fighting spirit and strive to build a great motherland.

    “政府委员”影片中
    索告诺娃的斗争精神鼓舞着我们
    编辑同志：你知道我们看了苏联影片“政府委员”后是多么兴奋！它给我们以很大力量。影片主角索告诺娃的斗争事迹，增强了我们对共产主义胜利的信心。索告诺娃原是一个普普通通地受地主折磨、挨丈夫拳头的农村妇女，她在党的教育和培养下成长起来，在斗争中成长起来，克服了许许多多的困难，终于获得了胜利：把一个落后的农村建设成一个繁荣的集体农庄。她成为一个优秀的集体农庄主席，被推选为苏联最高苏维埃代表。她所走的道路清楚地告诉我们：只有在人民的政权下，妇女才有充分发挥自己才能的可能，但这也不是不经过斗争就可达到的；只有不断斗争，克服一切困难，妇女才能发挥潜在力量。我们要学习索告诺娃的斗争精神，为建设伟大祖国而奋斗。
