Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: Tokyo delayed dispatch: The Temporary Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on January 22nd, firmly opposing the Yoshida treacherous government's 1952 budget draft. The statement said: The 1952 budget draft most centrally embodies the Yoshida government's policies of treachery, war, and fascist rule. The statement continued: We firmly oppose this budget draft because:

    First, this budget completely disregards the Japanese people's demands for independence and peace. On the contrary, it is the most shameful colonial budget serving the war plans of foreign imperialists and domestic reactionaries. The Yoshida government formulated this budget according to the instructions of its masters. Regarding only the following expenses: 65 billion yen for "occupation costs" – "defense burden sharing fees," 56 billion yen for "various security guarantee fees," 11 billion yen for "post-peace restoration handling fees," etc., it places an even heavier burden on the Japanese people than before. This budget is not for Japan's independence, peace, and happiness, but to allow foreign troops to permanently occupy Japan.

    Second, this budget is for rearming Japan, establishing fascist rule domestically, and throwing the people into war. In order to use Japan as a cheap source of cannon fodder and an base for aggression, the imperialists are frantically carrying out rearmament. The Yoshida government attempts to strengthen the "Police Reserve Force" and the "Maritime Safety Agency" and the national police into regular troops. 54 billion yen for "Police Reserve Force fees," 8.7 billion yen for "Maritime Safety Agency fees," 18.7 billion yen for "National Police fees," and other expenses illustrate this point. This budget is to make Japan a sacrifice to the imperialists' policy of ruling the world, driving Japan to the brink of war and destruction.

    Third, this budget completely destroys national livelihood, carrying out thorough plunder of the Japanese people through heavy taxes and high prices, and suppressing wages and rice prices. The total budget amounts to 852.7 billion yen, but the expenses for relieving war victims, education, and increasing food production account for only a small portion.

    Fourth, this budget is a dictatorial secret budget with the nature of "temporary military expenses," and the related military expenses do not specify detailed uses. During the war, Tojo claimed to keep "military secrets" and refused to publish the contents of the "temporary military expenses," only to have the Diet approve his budget afterward. Now, Yoshida, as a running dog of the United States, attempts to force the Japanese people to accept his dealings similar to Tojo's.

    The statement continued: We firmly oppose this budget draft based on the above reasons. This budget draft is precisely the inevitable consequence of the two treacherous treaties signed in San Francisco. Once this budget draft is established, the occupation system will be strengthened, rearmament and fascistization will be accelerated, and national livelihood and the national economy will be destroyed.

    The statement finally issued a call: We sincerely hope that all patriotic compatriots will unite, bravely smash this budget draft, and further realize the dissolution of the Diet and the overthrow of the Yoshida government.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: According to TASS Tokyo dispatch: On February 26th, the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet passed the government's budget draft for the 1952 fiscal year. Most of the funds in the budget are allocated for military expenses.

    Before the vote, all opposition party members of the House of Representatives on the Budget Committee spoke against the approval of this draft and requested continued debate. The Liberal Party members of the House of Representatives, who held the majority in the committee, rejected this request. All seventeen committee members representing the opposition parties immediately withdrew from the meeting, leaving only the representatives of the Liberal Party, who passed the budget draft themselves.

    The opposition parties in the Diet, except for the Communist Party, issued a joint statement accusing the government of wanting to use a mechanical majority to forcibly pass the budget draft in the committee, and of secretly concluding an "administrative agreement" without consulting the Diet, which "restricts Japan's sovereignty and the basic rights of the people, and seriously infringes on Japan's national independence."

    The "Asahi Shimbun" emphasized that this statement reflects the sentiments of the Japanese people, and the newspaper said: "If the Diet allows the conclusion of such an administrative agreement, the Diet will become a group used by the United States."

    On February 23rd, the Communist Party Diet members group issued a statement protesting the illegal measures of the Yoshida government attempting to interrupt the Diet's debate on the "administrative agreement" that "seriously infringes on the rights of the Japanese people," and demanded that the idea of concluding the "administrative agreement" be abandoned.

    On February 25th, the opposition parties issued a statement demanding the revision of the budget draft. The Reform Party demanded the cancellation of the so-called "security" expenses totaling 56 billion yen, and demanded that the Diet discuss the issue of allocating maintenance fees for the US military stationed in Japan after the conclusion of the "administrative agreement." The right wing of the Socialist Party demanded the cancellation of these two expenses and insisted on reducing the expenses of the "Police Reserve Force" and the "Maritime Safety Agency." The left wing of the Socialist Party demanded the cancellation of all military expenses and payments for US "aid."

    On February 27th, the House of Representatives passed the budget draft by a vote of 238 to 116. Only the members representing the government party – the Liberal Party – voted in favor. Communist Party members, Labor-Farmer Party members, left-wing and right-wing Socialist Party members, Social Democratic Party, Reform Party, and other party members voted against it.

    The opposition party members also spoke against the budget draft at the House of Representatives meeting. The opposition parties sharply criticized the government's actions in a statement issued after the meeting.

    日共临时中央指导部发表声明
    坚决反对吉田卖国政府预算草案
    国会反对党发表联合声明抨击吉田政府
    【新华社一日讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党临时中央指导部曾在一月二十二日发表声明，坚决反对吉田卖国政府的一九五二年度预算草案。声明说：一九五二年度的预算草案，最集中地表现了吉田政府的卖国、战争和法西斯统治的政策。声明接着说：我们坚决反对这个预算草案，原因是：
    第一，这个预算完全不顾日本人民对于独立与和平的要求。相反地，它是为外国帝国主义者和国内反动派的战争计划服务的最可耻的殖民地预算。吉田政府听从其主子的指示制订了这个预算。仅就下列费用而言，即：六百五十亿日元的“占领费”——“防卫分担费”、五百六十亿日元的“各项安全保障费”、一百一十亿日元的“恢复和平善后处理费”等等，给日本人民加上了比以前更为沉重的负担。这个预算不是为了日本的独立、和平与幸福，而是为了使外国军队永久占领日本。
    第二，这个预算是重新武装日本、在国内建立法西斯统治、把国民投入战争的预算。帝国主义者为了把日本当作廉价的炮灰供应地和侵略基地，疯狂地进行着重整军备。吉田政府企图把“警察后备队”和“海上保安厅”以及国家警察增强为正规军。五百四十亿日元的“警察后备队费”、八十七亿日元的“海上保安厅费”、一百八十七亿日元的“国家警察费”以及其他费用，说明了这一点。这个预算是为了把日本作为帝国主义者统治世界的政策的牺牲品，把日本驱入战争和毁灭的边缘。
    第三，这个预算完全破坏国民生活，以重税和高物价、压低工资和米价为主要手段，对日本人民实行彻底的大掠夺。预算总额达八千五百二十七亿日元，但是用于救济战争受难者、教育、粮食增产等方面的费用，却仅占一小部分。
    第四，这个预算是带有“临时军事费”性质的独裁的秘密预算，有关的军事的费用都没有载明详细的用途。战时东条声称为了保守“军机秘密”，拒不发表“临时军事费”的内容，只不过使国会在事后承认他的预算而已。现在，吉田正以美国走狗的身份，企图强迫日本人民接受他的和东条同类的勾当。
    声明接着说：我们根据上述理由，坚决反对这个预算草案。这个预算草案正是在旧金山签订的两个卖国条约的当然后果。这个预算草案一旦成立，占领制度就要加强，重整军备和法西斯化就要加速，国民生活和国民经济即将毁灭。
    声明最后发出号召说：我们衷心希望一切爱国同胞团结起来，英勇地摧毁这个预算草案，并进而实现解散国会、打倒吉田政府。
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社东京讯：二月二十六日，日本国会众议院预算委员会通过了政府一九五二会计年度的预算草案。预算中的大部分款项是拨作军事费用的。
    在表决前，预算委员会中所有反对党的众议员都发言反对批准这个草案，并要求继续辩论。在委员会中占多数的自由党众议员否决了这个要求。委员会中代表反对党的全体十七位委员当即退席，只剩下自由党的代表，后者自己通过了预算草案。
    在国会中除共产党以外的各反对党发表了联合声明，指责政府想利用机械多数在委员会强行通过预算草案，并且不与国会谘商就秘密缔结“限制日本主权和人民的基本权利、并严重侵犯日本国家独立的”“行政协定”。
    “朝日新闻”强调指出，这篇声明反映了日本人民的情绪，该报说：“如果国会允许缔结这种行政协定，国会就会变成一种美国御用的集团。”
    二月二十三日，共产党国会议员团发表声明，抗议吉田政府企图中断国会关于“严重侵害日本人民的权利的”“行政协定”的辩论的违法措施，要求打消缔结“行政协定”的念头。
    二月二十五日，各反对党发表声明要求修改预算草案。改进党要求取消总额达五百六十亿日元的所谓有关“安全”的费用，并要求国会讨论拨付“行政协定”缔结后驻日美军维持费的问题。社会党右派要求取消这两项费用，并坚持削减“警察后备队”和“海上保安厅”的费用。社会党左派要求取消一切军事费用和对美“援”的支付。
    二月二十七日，众议院以二百三十八票对一百一十六票通过了预算草案。只有代表政府党——自由党——的议员投了赞成票。共产党议员、劳农党议员、左派和右派社会党议员和社会民主党、改进党以及其他党派的议员都投了反对票。
    各反对党议员并在众议院会议上发言反对预算草案。各反对党在会后发表的声明中尖锐地抨击政府的行动。
