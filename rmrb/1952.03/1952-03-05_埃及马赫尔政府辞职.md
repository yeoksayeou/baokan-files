　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 2nd: TASS reported on the 2nd that Maher's Egyptian government had resigned on March 1st.
　　Maher had come to power nearly a month ago. This was the result of the Anglo-American bloc's open interference to overthrow the Nahas Wafd Party government, which they found displeasing. After the American ambassador visited King Farouk, Maher was immediately ordered to form a cabinet.
　　After taking office, Maher publicly advocated resuming direct negotiations with Britain. He said his government was willing to participate in the Middle East aggressive bloc planned by the United States and Britain. Maher implemented martial law and took measures to suppress the domestic national liberation movement. According to newspaper reports, Maher also intensified "cooperation" with Washington, especially regarding so-called U.S. technical assistance to Egypt.
　　London Radio broadcast on the morning of the 1st that Maher and British Ambassador to Egypt, Stevenson, were to hold negotiations in a few hours on resolving the Anglo-Egyptian conflict. Subsequently, Egyptian King Farouk, at Maher's request, announced a one-month adjournment of the Egyptian parliament. Egyptian newspapers said that Maher made this request because he hoped to conduct negotiations "in a calm atmosphere" without interference from the parliament, as the majority of parliament members were Wafd Party members.
　　The decision to adjourn parliament was opposed by the Egyptian people. Authoritative sources in Cairo believed that "it is too early to be optimistic about the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations." They also believed that the Prime Minister and the British Ambassador "will encounter serious difficulties in the negotiation process."
　　Less than an hour before the negotiations were to begin, the British Embassy suddenly informed Maher that British Ambassador Stevenson had a "cold" and could not meet with the Prime Minister.
　　It is speculated that Maher's abandonment was due to the influence of certain forces. Cabinet ministers then held a special meeting. After the meeting, Maher submitted the resignation of his cabinet to the King. The resignation was immediately accepted by the King.
　　According to London Radio, a British Foreign Office spokesman in London said on the 1st that Britain was willing to negotiate with Maher's successor.
　　According to Cairo news, Hilali, who was expelled from the Wafd Party last year, has been ordered by the King to form a new cabinet.

    埃及马赫尔政府辞职
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社巴黎二日讯：马赫尔的埃及政府已在三月一日辞职。
    马赫尔是在将近一个月以前上台的。那是英美集团打算推翻不合他们心意的纳哈斯的华夫脱党政府而公开进行干涉的结果。在美国大使访晤法鲁克国王后，马赫尔就立即奉命组阁。
    马赫尔上台后，就公开主张恢复和英国的直接谈判。他说，他的政府愿意参加美国和英国所计划的中东侵略集团。马赫尔实行了戒严令，并采取了压制国内民族解放运动的措施。据报纸消息说，马赫尔同时和华盛顿方面加紧进行“合作”，特别是关于美国对埃及的所谓技术援助。
    伦敦电台在一日早晨广播说，马赫尔和英国驻埃及大使施谛文在数小时后就要进行关于解决英埃冲突问题的谈判。接着，埃及国王法鲁克应马赫尔的要求，宣布埃及议会休会一个月。埃及报纸说，马赫尔之所以提出这个要求，是由于他希望“在平静的气氛中”进行谈判而不受议会的干涉，因为议会中大多数的议员都是华夫脱党党员。
    议会休会的决定受到埃及人民的反对。开罗权威人士认为：“对英埃谈判抱乐观态度未免为时过早。”他们还认为：首相和英国大使“在谈判的过程中将遇到严重的困难”。
    在不到一个小时谈判就要开始的时候，英国大使馆突然通知马赫尔说，英国大使施谛文害了“伤风”，不能和首相会晤。
    据揣测：马赫尔的被抛弃，是由于某种势力的影响。内阁大臣们接着举行了一次特别会议。会后，马赫尔就向国王提出他的内阁的辞呈。辞呈立即被国王接受。
    据伦敦电台广播说，英国外交部的一个发言人一日在伦敦说，英国愿意和马赫尔的继任者进行谈判。
    据开罗消息，去年被华夫脱党开除党籍的希拉里已奉国王之命组织新阁。
