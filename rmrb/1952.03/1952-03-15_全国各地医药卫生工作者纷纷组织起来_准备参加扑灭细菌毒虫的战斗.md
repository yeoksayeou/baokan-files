Xinhua News Agency: Medical and health workers across the country are organizing to go to the front lines of the anti-bacterial warfare.

　　In Shenyang, over a thousand professors and students from one university requested to participate in the fight against insect pests. At one school, more than 95% of the faculty and students signed pledges in one day. Currently, over a hundred faculty and students from the school have formed an epidemic prevention team and have departed for areas where pests have been discovered to join the battle. Doctors from all private hospitals in Shenyang are also organizing. Liang Yun'gang, a doctor at the Shanshan Clinic in Heping District, mobilized over 130 colleagues to sign up to exterminate pests in affected areas. Health workers in Fushun are now confidently carrying out pest extermination efforts. An epidemic prevention team composed of faculty and students from a school in Fushun has participated in pest extermination efforts three times.

　　The science and technology community and the medical community in Shanghai held the first preparatory committee expansion meeting of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Medical Association's Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committee on the 9th. It was decided that the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Medical Association's Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committee would be officially established within days to mobilize relevant personnel throughout the city to participate in the struggle against bacterial warfare in an organized and planned manner. Teachers and students from various medical colleges and universities in Shanghai responded to the call of the Chinese Medical Association and are prepared to go to the front lines of the anti-bacterial war at any time. Another group of volunteer medical surgery teams in Shanghai departed for the front lines of the anti-bacterial war on the 10th.

　　Medical workers in Wuhu also warmly responded to the call of the Chinese Medical Association, signing up as volunteers to join epidemic prevention inspection teams. All students above the third grade at a certain college in Hefei expressed their readiness to rush to the front lines of the anti-bacterial war at any time and wrote to students across the country, calling for joint action to fight to smash the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism.

　　After the establishment of the Central South Branch of the Chinese Medical Association's Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committee, medical and health workers in Wuhan signed up with the association to join epidemic prevention teams. Xiangya Hospital in Changsha and the Guangzhou branch of the Chinese Medical Association have also formed volunteer anti-bacterial warfare epidemic prevention teams, awaiting orders to depart.

　　The preparatory committee of the Xi'an branch of the Chinese Medical Association's Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committee held a joint meeting with medical and health workers in the Northwest Region and Shaanxi Province on the 10th, establishing the preparatory committee of the Northwest Branch of the Chinese Medical Association's Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committee, and an epidemic prevention inspection team was also established. In Lanzhou, more than 400 people have voluntarily signed up to go to the front lines to extinguish the flames of bacterial warfare. Wang Wenyi, professor of bacteriology at the Medical College of Lanzhou University, and 125 students from the college requested to go to the Korean front to do epidemic prevention work.

　　In Chongqing, the number of medical and health workers who have signed up to join the volunteer epidemic prevention work team has increased to more than 2,000. In Guiyang, 450 medical and health workers have volunteered to sign up to go to the front lines of the anti-bacterial war. Medical and health workers in northern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, southern Sichuan, and western Sichuan have also enthusiastically signed up. The medical and health workers in Ya'an City, Xikang Province, recently established the Ya'an branch of the Chinese Medical Association's Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committee. The Chongqing branch of the Chinese Medical Association's Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committee held a radio symposium denouncing the U.S. military's bacterial warfare at the Southwest People's Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 12th. Chu Tunan, chairman of the Southwest Branch of the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, and Chen Wengui, director of the Chongqing branch of the Chinese Medical Association's Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committee, called on medical and health workers in the Southwest Region and Chongqing to warmly respond to the call of Fu Lianzhang, director of the Chinese Medical Association, to take active action and go to the front lines of the anti-bacterial war. The medical and health workers present expressed their determination on the spot. Ran Ruitu, captain of the Chongqing Volunteer Aid Korea Thoracic and Abdominal Surgery Team who had just returned from the Korean front, firmly requested to join the epidemic prevention team and return to the front. Dr. Mi Xihan proposed on the spot to donate a portion of his medicines and savings to the Chongqing branch of the Chinese Medical Association's Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committee.
