The All-China Textile Workers' Union Committee
Protests Atrocities of British Government in Hong Kong
[By Our Newspaper] The All-China Textile Workers' Union Committee issued a statement, angrily protesting the bloody massacre of our textile worker Chen Dayi by the British government in Hong Kong. The statement is as follows:

The bloodstains of the great fire created by the British government in Hong Kong in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City, last November have not yet dried, and now on March 1 this year, they massacred our residents who welcomed the "Delegation of People's Organizations from Guangdong Province and Guangzhou Municipality to Comfort Compatriots Affected by the Disaster in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City." Many compatriots were shot and wounded on the spot and more than 300 people were arrested. Among them, textile worker Chen Dayi was shot six times and died tragically in the Kowloon prison ward on the 17th. This news has aroused unparalleled anger among our textile workers across the country. In addition to expressing our condolences to the families of the deceased and the arrested compatriots, we also lodge a serious protest with the British government in Hong Kong.

British imperialism forcibly occupied our territory, Hong Kong, and has carried out barbaric plunder and oppression against our compatriots for more than a century. After the liberation of our country, British imperialism continued to disregard the strength of our people, carrying out illegal activities, demolishing our residents' houses, creating a holocaust of fire, leaving more than 16,000 compatriots homeless and displaced; unreasonably expelling our film artists Sima Wensen and other eight people from the country, and arresting Sin Pui-ling, director of the Kowloon Branch of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing General Union, Yao Jian, secretary, and other six people, whose whereabouts are still unknown; and condoning Chiang Kai-shek's remnant soldiers to sneak into our country from the Hong Kong and Kowloon areas to disturb and sabotage. This series of planned crimes proves that British imperialism is following the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism and carrying out various conspiracies to invade our country in Hong Kong.

We will never tolerate anyone invading the land of the people's China again. The British government in Hong Kong should immediately stop its provocative atrocities. Chinese textile workers are determined to take practical actions and join the people of the whole country to support the just struggle of our compatriots in Hong Kong. The aggressive conspiracy of U.S. and British imperialism will be completely crushed.

    我纺织工会全国委员会
    抗议香港英政府暴行
    【本报讯】中国纺织工会全国委员会发表声明，愤怒抗议香港英政府血腥屠杀我国纺织工人陈达仪。声明如下：
    去年十一月香港英国政府在九龙城东头村制造大火灾的血迹未干，又在今年三月一日屠杀欢迎“广东省、广州市各界人民团体慰问九龙城东头村受灾同胞代表团”的我国居民，许多同胞当场中弹受伤并被逮捕三百余人，其中纺织工人陈达仪身中六弹，于十七日惨死在九龙监牢病房中。这一消息传来，激起我全国纺织工人无比愤怒。我们除向死者家属及被捕同胞致以慰问外，并向香港英政府提出严正抗议。
    英帝国主义以暴力强占了我国的领土——香港，百余年来对我国同胞施以野蛮的掠夺和压迫。我全国解放后，英帝国主义竟继续藐视我国人民的力量，进行非法活动，拆毁我国居民房屋；制造火灾浩劫，使一万六千余同胞无家可归流离失所；无理驱逐我国电影艺术工作者司马文森等八人出境，并逮捕港九纺织染总工会九龙支会主任冼佩玲、书记姚坚等六人，至今下落不明；并纵容蒋匪残兵从港九地区潜入我国境扰乱破坏。这一系列有计划的罪行，证明英帝国主义尾随美帝国主义的侵略政策，在香港进行各种侵略我国的阴谋。
    我们决不能容忍任何人再来侵略人民中国的土地。香港英国政府应立即停止其挑衅的暴行。中国纺织工人决以实际行动和全国人民一起来支援香港同胞们的正义斗争。美英帝国主义的侵略阴谋必将彻底被粉碎。
