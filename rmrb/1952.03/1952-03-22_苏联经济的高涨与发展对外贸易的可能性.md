    The Upswing of the Soviet Economy and the Possibility of Developing Foreign Trade
    Ivanov, Deputy Director of the Institute of Commercial Information, Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade

    In recent years, the Soviet people have achieved remarkable successes in all aspects of economic and cultural construction. The development of industry and agriculture has not only recovered but also greatly exceeded pre-war levels. The Soviet Union's post-war five-year plan for the development of the national economy has been completed ahead of schedule.

    The results of economic construction in 1951 demonstrated the further upswing of the Soviet national economy. Soviet industrial production increased by another 16 percent, exceeding pre-war 1940 production by a factor of two. The increase in steel production in 1951 alone was nearly four million tons, almost equal to the total steel production of Tsarist Russia in 1913. The Soviet Union now produces roughly as much steel as Britain, France, Belgium, and Sweden combined. The output of coal and oil has also increased significantly. The Soviet power industry has also made tremendous achievements. Electricity production in 1951 increased by 14 percent compared to the previous year. The total electricity generated by Soviet power stations is now equal to that of Britain and France combined.

    The Soviet national economy possesses first-class technical equipment. All heavy and laborious processes are being mechanized. Many industrial sectors are undergoing complete mechanization. The Soviet machine-building industry is developing rapidly, creating 500 very important types of machines and equipment in 1951 alone, ensuring the further technical development of the national economy. Soviet industry has created various new types of powerful steam turbines and high-pressure boilers, hydraulic turbines and hydroelectric generators, powerful suction dredgers and dredgers, single-bucket and multi-bucket excavators.

    Soviet agriculture also achieved new successes last year. Although the climate was unfavorable in some areas, the total grain harvest still reached 7.4 billion poods. The harvest of the main grains—wheat and rye—was higher than in 1950, and the harvest of cotton and sugar beets last year exceeded previous levels. The Soviet Union now produces more cotton than the combined total cotton production of India, Pakistan, and Egypt, three countries famous for cotton production. The increase of 6.7 million hectares of sown area in 1951 will further increase the production of industrial raw materials and food.

    Soviet agriculture widely adopts the latest achievements of agricultural biological science, and the Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of agricultural mechanization.

    The foreign trade of any country depends on its economic situation. The continuous rise of the Soviet economy has enabled the rapid development of Soviet post-war foreign trade.

    As early as 1949, the physical volume of Soviet foreign trade turnover had already exceeded pre-war levels by more than twofold. The trade relations between the Soviet Union and the various People's Democratic countries are developing smoothly. In the last four years alone (1947-1950), the turnover of goods between the Soviet Union and Poland and Bulgaria increased by more than onefold, with Czechoslovakia and Hungary by more than fourfold, and with Romania by threefold. The proportion of the Soviet Union in China's foreign trade increased from 0.35 percent in 1936 to 7.76 percent in 1949, and further increased to 23.36 percent in 1950. According to preliminary and incomplete figures published in newspapers, in 1951, the proportion of Soviet goods accounted for 44.7 percent of China's imports, and the Soviet Union purchased half of China's exports. Trade between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, Albania, and other People's Democratic countries has also increased greatly.

    Trade between the Soviet Union and the various People's Democratic countries is conducted on the basis of equality and mutual benefit in a planned manner. This trade is mostly based on long-term trade agreements that guarantee a continuous exchange of goods. And the trade agreements concluded by the Soviet state are based on equality and mutual respect for sovereignty.

    The goods supplied by the Soviet Union to the various People's Democratic countries are the goods needed by these countries to successfully complete their national economic plans.

    The Soviet Union supplies the various People's Democratic countries with ores, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, cotton, petroleum products, automobiles, tractors, chemicals, agricultural machinery, heavy machine-building equipment, textile and construction equipment, mining equipment, and forestry equipment. And the various People's Democratic countries supply the Soviet Union with railway equipment, fabrics, tobacco, grain, and other goods.

    The expansion and consolidation of trade relations between the various People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union's great and selfless assistance to these countries, have played a particularly significant role in the economic construction of these countries.

    Foreign trade can promote the economic development of all countries and supplement various materials, so all countries are keen to expand foreign trade relations.

    There are now broad possibilities for developing mutually beneficial trade relations between all countries, regardless of their social and economic systems. As Stalin pointed out, exports and imports are the most appropriate way to achieve this goal.

    It should be pointed out that before and after World War II, trade relations between East and West had developed quite smoothly. However, since 1948, the situation has deteriorated sharply because the ruling groups of certain Western countries have embarked on the path of trade discrimination, trying every possible way to obstruct the normal international exchange of goods.

    Certain groups in Western countries are implementing a policy of trade boycott against the Soviet Union and the various People's Democratic countries, and they intend to use this method to hinder the peaceful construction of the Soviet Union and the various People's Democratic countries. But all these attempts to establish economic blockades have failed. Facts have proved that this policy of destroying normal trade relations between East and West is, first of all, shooting themselves in the foot for its instigators, for those who undermine international trade cooperation.

    The economies of many Western countries have fallen into dire straits. Civilian industry has shrunk, unemployment has increased, and the living standards of the working people have been declining. In fact, the economic situation of these countries can be greatly improved. This requires all countries to establish trade cooperation with each other. Many Western European countries have also begun to clearly feel the fatal consequences of refusing to trade with the Soviet Union and the various People's Democratic countries. Therefore, some business people who have a relatively clear understanding of the situation are also keenly concerned about the upcoming International Economic Conference in Moscow.

    The Soviet Union, which pursues a policy of peace, has always been committed to broad economic cooperation between countries on the basis of mutual benefit, and it also has great possibilities to do so. The world knows how important the Soviet Union plays in the supply of grain, timber, furs, ores and other goods. Due to the further upswing of the national economy, and due to the imminent realization of the great water conservancy projects on the Volga River, the Don River, Ukraine and Turkmenistan, this possibility will be greatly increased.

    Upon completion of these construction projects, annual production can be increased by three million tons of raw cotton (equivalent to more than one-third of the average annual cotton production of the United States), 500 million poods of wheat, 30 million poods of rice, and six million tons of sugar beets. The number of cattle in these areas will increase by two million heads, and the number of sheep will increase by nine million heads. This will promote the further increase of the Soviet Union's export possibilities.

    A strong and continuously developing industry enables the Soviet Union to supply other countries with various machinery and equipment, as it does now for the various People's Democratic countries.

    On the other hand, the Soviet Union can also place large orders with commercial and industrial organizations in other countries for ships, machinery, equipment, various fabrics, daily necessities, and other civilian products, thereby preventing the corresponding industrial sectors in Italy, France, Britain, Belgium, and other countries from reducing production and ensuring that tens of thousands of people get jobs.

    The destruction of normal trade relations between the West and the East is an artificially created obstacle. As long as we make sincere and joint efforts, this obstacle can be eliminated. (Translated by Chen Yongyi)

    苏联经济的高涨与发展对外贸易的可能性
    苏联国外贸易部商情研究所副所长  伊万诺夫
    最近几年来，苏联人民在经济文化建设的各方面都获得了显著的成就。工业和农业的发展不仅已经恢复而且大大地超过了战前的水平。苏联发展国民经济的战后五年计划已提前完成了。
    一九五一年经济建设的结果，说明了苏联国民经济的进一步高涨。苏联的工业生产又增加了百分之十六，超过了战前一九四○年生产一倍。仅一九五一年钢生产的增加量，就将近四百万吨，几乎等于一九一三年沙皇俄国全部钢的产量。现在苏联生产的钢，大约等于英国、法国、比利时和瑞典的总和。煤和石油的产量也增加了很多。苏联动力工业也获得了巨大的成就。一九五一年生产的电力，比去年增加了百分之十四。现在苏联各发电站所发出的全部电力，等于英法两国的总和。
    苏联的国民经济拥有头等的技术设备。一切笨重吃力的手续都在实行机械化。不少工业部门正在进行着全部的机械化。苏联机器制造业正飞速地发展着，仅在一九五一年就创造了五百种非常重要的机器与设备，确保了国民经济在技术上的进一步发展。苏联工业创造了各种新式的效力强大的蒸气透平和高压锅炉、水力透平和水力发电机、效力强大的吸泥机和挖泥机、单吊斗和复吊斗的挖掘机。
    苏联农业在去年也获得了新的成就。虽然某些地区气候失调，但谷物总收成仍达到七十四亿普特。主要谷物——小麦和裸麦——的收成较一九五○年为高，去年的棉花和甜菜的收获量超过了前几年的水平。苏联现在生产的棉花，超过了印度、巴基斯坦和埃及这三个以产棉而著名的国家棉产的总和。一九五一年增加的六百七十万公顷播种面积，将进一步提高工业原料和食品的生产。
    苏联农业广泛地采用着农业生物科学最新的成就，苏联在农业机械化程度上，占世界第一位。
    任何一个国家的对外贸易，都决定于这国家的经济状况如何。苏联经济的不断上升，使苏联的战后对外贸易得以迅速地发展。
    早在一九四九年，苏联对外贸易周转额的实物数量，已经超过了战前水平一倍多。苏联与各人民民主国家的贸易关系在顺利地发展着。单单在最近四年内（一九四七年——一九五○年），苏联与波兰和保加利亚之间的货物周转额增加了一倍以上，与捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利之间的增加了四倍以上，与罗马尼亚之间的增加了三倍。苏联在中国对外贸易中所占的比重，从一九三六年的百分之零点三五增加到一九四九年的百分之七点七六，到一九五○年更增加到百分之二十三点三六。据报章上发表的初步不完全的数字，一九五一年苏联货物的比重，占中国输入额百分之四十四点七，中国输出额中，有一半是苏联所购买的货物。苏联与德意志民主共和国、阿尔巴尼亚和其他人民民主国家间的贸易也大为增加了。
    苏联与各人民民主国家之间的贸易，是在平等互利的基础上有计划地进行的。这种贸易，大多是以一些保证货物不断交流的长期贸易协定为依据的。而苏维埃国家所订立的贸易协定，又是以平等和互相尊重主权为基础的。
    苏联所供给各人民民主国家的货物，是这些国家为了顺利完成它们的国民经济计划所需要的货物。
    苏联供给各人民民主国家矿石、黑色金属和有色金属、棉花、石油产品、汽车、拖拉机、化学药品、农业机器、重机器制造业设备、纺织业和建筑业设备、采矿设备和林业设备。而各人民民主国家则供给苏联铁路设备、布匹、烟草、粮食和其他货物。
    各人民民主国家对苏贸易关系的扩展和巩固、苏联对这些国家巨大而无私的援助，在这些国家的经济建设中起了特别重大的作用。
    对外贸易可以促进各国的经济发展，补充各种物资，所以一切国家都是热中于扩展对外贸易关系的。
    现在有着发展各国之间互利的贸易关系的广泛的可能性，不分其社会和经济制度如何。正如斯大林所指出的，输出和输入，是达到这个目的的最妥善的方式。
    应当指出，在第二次世界大战前和大战结束后，东方和西方的贸易关系曾有过相当顺利的发展。可是，从一九四八年开始，由于西方某些国家的统治集团走上了歧视贸易的道路，千方百计地阻挠正常的国际货物交换，使情况剧烈地恶化了。
    西方国家的某些集团对苏联和各人民民主国家实行着贸易抵制政策，它们打算用这样的方法，来妨碍苏联和各人民民主国家的和平建设。但是这一切建立经济封锁的企图，全都落了空。事实证明，这种破坏东方和西方正常贸易关系的政策，对于它的策动者，对于那些破坏国际贸易合作的人，首先是搬了石头打了自己的脚。
    许多西方国家的经济已经陷入了绝境。民用工业减缩、失业增加，劳动人民的生活水平在一直地下降。其实这些国家的经济状况是可以大加改善的。这就需要一切国家互相建立贸易上的合作。许多西欧国家也开始明显地感觉到拒绝与苏联和各人民民主国家通商的致命恶果了。所以，某些比较清醒地估量局势的工商界人士，也热烈地关心着即将在莫斯科召开的国际经济会议。
    实行和平政策的苏联，一向致力于各国间在互利基础上的广泛的经济合作，并且自己也有这样去做的很大的可能性。全世界都知道苏联在谷物、木材、皮毛、矿石等货物的供应上起着如何巨大的作用。由于国民经济进一步的高涨，由于即将实现伏尔加河、顿河、乌克兰和土库曼的巨大水利建设工程，这种可能性更将大大增加。
    完成了这些建设工程，就可以每年增产三百万吨原棉（等于美国平均每年棉产量的三分之一以上）、五亿普特小麦、三千万普特大米和六百万吨甜菜。这些地区的牛将增加二百万头，绵羊将增加九百万头。这都将促进苏联输出的可能性的进一步增加。
    强大而不断发展的工业，使苏联能够供给其他国家以各种机器设备，正如现在对各人民民主国家那样。
    另一方面，苏联对其他国家的商业和工业组织，也可以在船只、机器、设备、各种织物、日用品和其他民用生产品方面大批订货，从而可以使意大利、法国、英国、比利时和其他各国相应的工业部门不致减产，保证好几十万人得到工作。
    破坏了西方和东方的正常贸易关系的，是人工造成的障碍。只要诚意地共同地努力，这个障碍是可以消除的。    （陈用仪译）
