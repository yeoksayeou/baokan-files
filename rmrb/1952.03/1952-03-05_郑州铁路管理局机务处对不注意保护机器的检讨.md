    Zhengzhou Railway Administration Locomotive Department's Self-Criticism for Neglecting Machine Protection

    Editor: On December 20, 1951, the People's Daily published Wang Qingwu's criticism of our department's Power Plant for failing to protect important machinery. This criticism is correct. For more than two years, we adopted an irresponsible attitude towards this batch of machines - eight 38-foot lathes and two boxes of locomotive cylinders. Because we did not need this batch of machines (except for the locomotive cylinders), we listed them as materials to be handed over during inventory and waited for higher authorities to allocate them. We temporarily entrusted the custody of these machines to the Power Plant and never inquired about them again. We committed a serious bureaucratic error. We sincerely accept Comrade Wang Qingwu's criticism and have taken the following actions: On the one hand, we worked with the Bureau's Materials Department to allocate the machines to other units for use; on the other hand, we provided temporary cover for these machines and applied oil for rust prevention.

    郑州铁路管理局机务处对不注意保护机器的检讨
    编辑同志：一九五一年十二月二十日人民日报刊载了王庆五对我处电力所不注意保护重要机器的批评，这个批评是正确的。二年多来，我们对这批机器——八台三十八呎镟床和二箱机车汽缸，采取了不负责任的态度。由于我们用不着这批机器（机车汽缸除外），在清点物资时，就把它们列为上缴物资，一直等待上级来调拨。我们把这些机器的保管工作暂时交给电力所代管，就再也没有过问了。我们犯了严重的官僚主义的错误。我们诚恳地接受王庆五同志的批评，并作了如下处理：一方面会同我局材料处把机器调拨到其他单位去使用；另一方面对这批机器作了临时性的遮盖，以及涂油防腐的工作。
