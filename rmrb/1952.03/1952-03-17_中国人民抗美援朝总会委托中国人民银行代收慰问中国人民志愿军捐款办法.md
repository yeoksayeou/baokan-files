Measures for the People's Bank of China to Collect Donations on Behalf of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea to Comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers

Article 1: All donations from people from all walks of life and from institutions, organizations, schools, and individuals throughout the country to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers (including book and newspaper payments, Korean War Comfort Funds, and all other donations, hereinafter referred to as "donations") shall be uniformly collected and remitted by the People's Bank of China (hereinafter referred to as "the Bank") on behalf of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea (hereinafter referred to as "the General Committee").

Article 2: Donations shall be made in Renminbi. If there is gold, silver, or foreign currency, the donor should exchange it for Renminbi at the bank (or the Bank of China) at the quoted price before depositing it into the account. Other valuable securities and physical objects should be handled and converted into Renminbi by the donor in consultation with relevant units before being handed over to the bank.

Article 3: All donations in various regions shall be collected by the local bank (donations in Beijing shall be collected by the Beijing Branch), and the collecting bank shall issue receipts on behalf of the General Committee.

Article 4: Local banks should establish a "Remittance of Donations to Comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers Account" (referred to as the "Remittance of Comfort Donations Account"). The business office of the head office of the Bank should establish a "Donations to Comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers Account" (referred to as the "Comfort Donations Account"), and the right to withdraw from it belongs to the General Committee.

Article 5: Local banks should issue receipts for donations received, in triplicate (attached form 1):

    The first copy (receipt) is given to the donor for safekeeping;
    The second copy (notice) is sent to the local branch of the Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea;
    The third copy (substitute transfer slip) is kept by the bank as an accounting voucher.

Article 6: When county (city) sub-branches receive donations, they should immediately deposit them into the Remittance of Comfort Donations Account. At the end of each ten-day period, after the close of business, they should settle the amount and remit it to the provincial branch bank under its jurisdiction via mail transfer. They should also prepare a list of donations to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers (the format will be notified separately by the bank, referred to as the "donation list") in triplicate. One copy should be attached to the mail transfer authorization and sent to the branch bank, one copy, together with the notification slips for the donations received in the ten-day period, should be sent to the local branch of the Committee, and one copy should be retained.

Article 7: When provincial (municipal) branch banks receive donations and donations remitted from subordinate sub-branches, they should immediately deposit them into the Remittance of Comfort Donations Account. At the end of each ten-day period, after the close of business, they should settle the amount and remit it to the business office of the head office via mail transfer. They should also prepare a list of donations in triplicate. One copy should be attached to the mail transfer authorization and sent to the head office, one copy, together with the donation lists reported by the subordinate sub-branches for the ten-day period, should be sent to the local branch of the Committee, and one copy should be retained.

    (An additional copy may be sent to the regional bank if necessary.)

Article 8: When the business office of the head office receives donations remitted from provincial (municipal) branch banks, it should immediately deposit them into the Comfort Donations Account, and at the end of each ten-day period, prepare a list of donations in duplicate. One copy, together with the donation lists reported by the provincial (municipal) branch banks for the ten-day period, should be sent to the General Committee, and one copy should be retained.

Article 9: Banks at all levels should prepare a reconciliation statement at the end of each month to reconcile accounts with the branches of the Committee at all levels and review for any errors.

Article 10: Branches of the Committee at all levels should make statistics based on the donation lists and donation notices sent by the bank, and after verification with the bank and relevant materials (donor reports, etc.), announce them to the people locally on a regular basis. County branches announce the names and amounts of donors, provincial (municipal) branches announce the amount of donations from each county (city), city branches should also announce the names and amounts of donors, and the General Committee announces the amount of donations from each province (city).

Article 11: Branches of the Committee at all levels shall not directly collect donations. If there are donors who come to donate, they should be immediately introduced to the bank for collection. If the bank finds that donations are directly remitted to branches of the Committee at all levels when handling remittances, it should explain and issue a receipt for collection. Donations remitted to branches of the Committee at all levels through the post office (or bank) shall be stamped by the branches of the Committee at all levels and handed over to the local bank for deposit, and shall not be withdrawn in cash or re-remitted.

Article 12: The expenses required by the General Committee, branch committees, and subcommittees in various regions, such as the packaging and transportation costs of comfort items, shall be reported to the General Committee for approval and allocation, and shall not be disbursed from local donations.

Article 13: Donations in the Comfort Donations Account of the head office business office shall accrue interest as public deposits. Donations in the Remittance of Comfort Donations Account of local banks shall not accrue interest. The bank shall not charge any remittance fees or postage for handling collection and remittance.

Article 14: These measures shall be implemented from April 1, 1952. The validity period of the head office's (51) General Business Letter No. 520 directive to all branches to collect Korean War donations expires on March 31, 1952.
