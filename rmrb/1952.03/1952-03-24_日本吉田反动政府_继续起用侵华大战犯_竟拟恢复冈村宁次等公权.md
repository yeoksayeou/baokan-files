Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 22nd: The Japanese authorities, pursuing a militaristic policy, continue to employ war criminals and those who participated in Japan's aggression. According to Tokyo newspapers, the so-called "Public Service Qualification Appeal Review Committee" of the reactionary Japanese government recommended restoring the civil rights of most of the 2,000 people it reviewed on March 20th, including Okamura Yasuji, former commander of the Japanese invading army in China. According to the "Tokyo Shimbun," the committee also recommended restoring the civil rights of Hata Shunroku, former supreme commander of the Japanese Central China Expeditionary Army and one of the major war criminals.

Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd, Tokyo Dispatch: The reactionary Yoshida government continues to illegally lift the purges of a large number of militarists, including the extremely sinful war criminals who invaded China, such as Kobayashi Seizo, Aoki Kazuo, and Tani Masayuki. The Yoshida government first announced the lifting of purges against 843 army, navy, and gendarmerie personnel on the 14th. Among them were many former senior Japanese military officers and cabinet ministers, such as Kichisaburo Nomura, former Japanese ambassador to the United States and admiral of the navy; Kobayashi Seizo, former governor-general of Taiwan and director-general of the "Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association"; Hirotsugu Matsuzaka, former Minister of Justice; Takuo Godo, former Minister of Commerce and Industry; as well as Katsu Shinzo Yamawaki, Eiso Yamamoto, Gengo Hyutake, and Narumi Inoue, former admirals of the navy; Shojiro Iida and Yoshio Kozuki, former lieutenant generals of the army, and others.

Subsequently, on the 19th, the Yoshida government lifted the purge measures against another 760 people, including Kazuo Aoki, who served as Minister of Greater East Asia in the Tojo Cabinet and the highest economic advisor to the Wang Jingwei puppet regime; Masayuki Tani, former Foreign Minister and ambassador to the Wang Jingwei puppet regime; Yoriyasu Arima, former advisor to the "Imperial Rule Assistance Association" and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry; Kenkichi Ueda, former general of the army; and Shigenori Kuroda, former lieutenant general of the army, who was recently illegally released by the Quirino government and other notorious major war criminals. So far, since February 8th of this year, the total number of war criminals who have had their purges lifted by the Yoshida government has reached 3,469.

Moreover, according to Kyodo News, the "Public Service Qualification Appeal Review Committee" has made a "preliminary decision" on the 14th to lift the purges against Mamoru Shigemitsu, former Foreign Minister, Yoshio Ushijima, former commander-in-chief of the China Expeditionary Army, and other war criminals, who owe countless blood debts to the Chinese people and were illegally released by the United States.

At the same time, the Yoshida government has formulated a bill on the amnesty of war criminals based on Article 11 of the U.S.-Japan peace treaty. This bill will soon be submitted to the Diet for approval.

    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社上海二十二日讯：奉行军国主义化政策的日本当局，继续起用战争罪犯和参与过日本的侵略的人。据东京报纸报道：日本反动政府的所谓“公职资格诉愿审查委员会”建议恢复该会在三月二十日审查的二千人之中的大多数人的公权，其中有前日本侵华派遣军司令冈村宁次。据“东京新闻”报道：该委员会也建议恢复主要战犯之一的前日本华中派遣军最高指挥官畑俊六的公权。
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：吉田反动政府继续非法地把罪大恶极的侵华战犯小林跻造、青木一男、谷正之等大批军国主义分子解除整肃。吉田政府首先在十四日对八百四十三名陆军、海军和宪兵人员等宣布解除整肃。其中有许多人都是前日军高级将领和内阁大臣，例如，前日本驻美大使、海军大将野村吉三郎、前台湾总督、“翼赞政治会”总务小林跻造、前司法相松阪广政、前商工相伍堂卓雄，以及前海军大将山黎胜之进、山本英辅、百武源吾、井上成美，前陆军中将饭田祥二郎和上月良夫等人。
    接着，吉田政府又在十九日解除了另外七百六十人的整肃处分，其中包括曾任东条内阁大东亚相、驻汪逆精卫伪政府最高经济顾问的青木一男，前外相、驻汪逆精卫伪政府大使谷正之，以及前“大政翼赞会”顾问、农林相有马赖宁，前陆军大将植田谦吉和最近被季里诺政府非法释放的战犯前陆军中将黑田重德等臭名远扬的大战犯。至此为止，自今年二月八日以来，被吉田政府解除整肃的战犯总数已达三千四百六十九名。
    不仅如此，据共同社透露，对于曾欠下中国人民无数血债而被美国非法释放的甲级战犯前外相重光葵、前中国派遣军总司令西尾寿造以及其他战犯，已由“公职资格诉愿审查委员会”在十四日“初步决定”予以解除整肃。
    与此同时，吉田政府已根据美制对日和约第十一条，制订关于赦免战犯的法案。这一法案即将提交国会批准。
