Beijing's universities and colleges are at a deep stage in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. On the one hand, the schools have launched a fierce struggle against bourgeois ideology. On the other hand, they have launched a siege against corrupt elements.

Since mid-January, Beijing's universities have been concentrating their efforts on combating corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and the movement is now at its peak. This movement has not only exposed corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, but has also deeply exposed and eliminated the decadent and reactionary ideas of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has become a profound ideological remolding movement. Experience has proven that it is necessary and feasible to carry out the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in universities and colleges.

On the ideological struggle front, the schools have launched a fierce struggle against bourgeois ideology. Teachers, students, staff, and workers have risen to expose many serious phenomena in some administrative leaders and some professors that are detrimental to national construction and harmful to the interests of the people, forcing them to voluntarily or involuntarily put down their "airs," conduct self-criticism, and reveal past hidden and unsavory things. Many presidents, deans, department heads, professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants have made self-criticisms in front of the masses. Some have criticized irresponsible bureaucracy, some have criticized factionalism with mutual infighting, some have criticized departmentalism that harms others and benefits oneself, some have exposed selfish behavior, and some have criticized pro-American and worship-American ideas. Many administrative leaders and teachers in many schools have recognized their ideological problems and are willing to correct their mistakes, and have made relatively profound self-criticisms, making significant progress. Therefore, the masses have expressed warm welcome to them. Some administrative leaders and some teachers in some schools are unwilling to face up to their shortcomings and mistakes, are perfunctory in front of the masses, and do not conduct profound self-criticism. Some even resist criticism, and thus have been severely criticized and criticized by the masses. Those who made good self-criticisms have discarded their ideological burdens and are moving forward by leaps and bounds; while those who did not make good self-criticisms are still burdened with heavy burdens and have fallen behind. For example, Qiu Chun, professor of the Department of Education of Beijing Normal University, Nie Chongqi, professor of the Department of History of Yenching University, Dong Weixian, associate professor of the Department of Chemistry of Fu Jen Catholic University, and Lu Huaibao, professor of the Department of Biology, etc., adopted a resistant attitude towards criticism and self-criticism in this movement. They could not seriously and honestly conduct self-criticism and liquidate the roots of their erroneous ideas, and thus were severely criticized by teachers and students. Among them, individual professors, with the help of school leaders and students, although they have bowed their heads in front of the masses to admit their mistakes, are still incomplete and superficial, and must continue to deeply examine their own thoughts. Chen Yuan, president of Fu Jen Catholic University, Tang Yongtong, vice president of Peking University, Lin Liru, president of Beijing Normal University, Jiang Yin'en, director of the Department of Journalism of Yenching University, Hou Renzhi, professor of the Department of History, Liang Sicheng, director of the Department of Architecture of Tsinghua University, and Jin Yuelin, dean of the Faculty of Arts, etc., dared to conduct self-criticism in front of the masses and expose their mistakes, and thus were welcomed by teachers and students.

After this serious and intense ideological struggle, significant changes have taken place in the ideological aspects of teachers in Beijing's universities and colleges, that is, bourgeois ideology has begun to fall from the place it occupies. The vast majority of teachers have recognized the power of the masses, recognized the correct leadership of the Communist Party, and also recognized the great significance of ideological remolding. They have personally experienced the care of the People's Government and the Communist Party for their work and future. Some professors who were very backward in politics or irresponsible in their work in the past exposed their mistakes under the criticism of the masses this time, and many professors made profound self-criticisms of their own erroneous ideas, expressing their determination to correct them in future work.

In the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the ugliness of departmentalism and mutual exclusion between factions in various schools, departments, and professors were publicly exposed and criticized, and the patriarchal style in universities was also overthrown. For example, among the professors of the Department of Education of Beijing Normal University, there has been a long-term lack of unity and mutual attacks, with "one professor, one mountain top." During the teacher's study period, "you say your thing, I say my thing," resulting in disunity and chaos, making the study fruitless. In this movement, this ugliness of disunity and infighting was publicly exposed. The three main professors of the Department of Nursery Science were revealed for their power struggles, infighting, and grabbing for the position of department head and academic privatization. The phenomenon of factional struggle in the Department of Agricultural Chemistry of Beijing Agricultural University was even more serious, and was fully exposed in this movement.

In the anti-corruption struggle, the schools exposed a large number of facts of corruption. Among the corrupt elements, there were not only staff members, but also professors and department heads. Some accepted bribes, some stole state property; some stole people's scholarships and enrollment fees; some sold test questions; some stole and sold books, instruments, medicines and other equipment. The schools launched an offensive against corrupt elements in a focused and step-by-step manner. Those corrupt elements who confessed relatively thoroughly were given lenient treatment by the leadership; while those who refused to confess were subjected to mass struggle meetings or handed over to the government for arrest and prosecution. These facts refuted the claim that "schools are 'clean government agencies.'"

In the anti-waste struggle, the schools held anti-waste exhibitions. Recently, the Beijing Municipal Higher Education Institutions Thrift Inspection Committee held a city-wide anti-waste exhibition for higher education institutions. Through the exhibition, not only was the bureaucracy of the administrative leadership of the schools exposed, but also the factionalism, departmentalism, and bourgeois selfish and self-interested ideas were exposed, as well as pro-American and worship-American ideas. In the School of Engineering of Peking University, a large number of machines and industrial equipment urgently needed by the national industrial departments were stockpiled in the warehouse, but the administrative leaders of the college were unwilling or refused to lend some of the machines to the national construction departments. In the construction of the "Yan'an Building" at the Beijing Institute of Technology, more than 2 billion yuan was stolen by unscrupulous merchants due to the bureaucracy of the leadership. In the warehouses of the Peking Union Medical College and the Peking University School of Medicine, a large number of medicines and medical equipment urgently needed by the Korean front were stockpiled, some of which had become moldy and ineffective, and some of which had been damaged. Yenching University hoarded glass tubes that could be used for more than 20 years as if they were "lifeblood" and were reluctant to use them. Why? Because it was "American goods." The libraries of Peking University and Tsinghua University still preserve many yellow and reactionary books and periodicals. For example, the Tsinghua University Library displays "My Struggle" and "Mussolini's Biography," which are extremely reactionary and glorify fascist culprits, allowing them to spread ideological toxins; while a large number of new political books are bundled up and buried in warehouses. During the exhibition period, the schools organized teachers and students to visit, so that everyone was aroused with hatred and animosity towards the phenomenon of waste, established the concept of cherishing state and people's property, and improved the understanding and fighting spirit of teachers and students towards the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. After seeing the school's anti-waste exhibition, a professor in the Department of Entomology of Beijing Agricultural University said: "After seeing the results of the preliminary inspection, I am extremely saddened and hate the crimes I have committed." After seeing the school's anti-waste exhibition, a professor in the Department of Agricultural Chemistry of the school reviewed and said: "When I think of the scene of fighting for funds with red faces, grabbing them in large quantities and spending them in large quantities, I really feel uneasy."

The experience of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in Beijing's universities and colleges proves that to thoroughly carry out this struggle, first of all, the leadership must show determination and publicly announce that they must carry out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the schools to the end, and that bourgeois ideology in universities and colleges must be eliminated and the ideology of the working class must be established. Secondly, it is necessary to fully promote democracy, mobilize all teachers, students, staff, and workers, especially to mobilize and use the power of students, to carry out exposure and criticism from the bottom up (to expose boldly and publicly, to criticize seriously and sharply). Third, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of activists to become the backbone of promoting the movement forward. Fourth, due to the complexity of the struggle, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the movement. Without a strong combat headquarters, the struggle cannot be won. After the movement is launched, the leadership must grasp the link of ideological struggle and must not relax, because ideological struggle is the main aspect of this movement.

At present, Beijing's universities are leading the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to a more intense and in-depth stage, and are carrying out a resolute struggle against bourgeois ideology in three aspects. One aspect is ideological struggle, through this great struggle, to eliminate the bourgeois ideology entrenched in the schools, so as to establish the leadership of the working class ideology. This is the main aspect of the struggle. One aspect is the anti-corruption struggle, continuing to besiege corrupt elements, searching them thoroughly, and never stopping until complete victory. The other aspect is the anti-waste struggle, using the large number of waste facts that have been exposed to educate all staff and students, so that they clearly understand the serious harm of bureaucracy, bourgeois ideology, and pro-American and worship-American ideas.

    北京高等学校师生员工对资产阶级思想展开坚决斗争
    北京市高等学校反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，正处在深入阶段，各校一方面对资产阶级思想展开了激烈的斗争，另一方面对贪污分子展开了围攻。
    北京各大学从一月中旬起，即集中力量进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，现在已进入高潮。此次运动不仅揭发了贪污、浪费、官僚主义现象，并且深入地揭发了和扫除了资产阶级的腐朽思想和反动思想。因此，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动成为一次深刻的思想改造运动。经验证明，在高等学校里进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争是十分必要的，是可以做好的。
    在思想斗争战线上，各校对资产阶级思想展开了激烈的斗争。教师、同学、职员、工友，都起来揭发某些行政领导者和一些教授中的许多有碍国家建设、有害人民利益的严重现象，使他们不得不自动地或被迫地放下“架子”，进行检讨，揭发过去隐藏的不可告人的肮脏东西。许多校长、院长、系主任、教授、讲师、助教都在群众面前做了检讨，有的检讨了不负责任的官僚主义，有的检讨了互相倾轧的宗派主义、有的检讨了损人利己的本位主义，有的揭发了自私自利的行为，有的批判了崇美、亲美思想。许多学校的行政领导人和教师，认识了自己思想上的毛病，愿意纠正错误，都作了比较深刻的检讨，有着显著的进步。因此群众对他们都表示热烈的欢迎；有些学校的行政领导人和某些教师，不愿意正视自己的缺点和错误，在群众面前敷衍，不进行深刻的检讨，有的甚至抗拒批评，因而遭到了群众的严厉指责和批评。检讨好的，由于丢掉了思想上的包袱，他们是大踏步地前进了；而那些检讨不好的，仍然背负着沉重的包袱，他们是落后了。例如北京师范大学教育系教授邱椿，燕京大学历史系教授聂崇岐，辅仁大学化学系副教授董维宪、生物系教授鹿怀宝等，在这次运动中对批评和自我批评采取抗拒的态度，他们不能认真地、老实地进行检讨、清算自己错误思想的根源，因而受到教师和同学们的严厉批评。其中个别教授，在学校领导同志和同学的帮助下，虽然已经在群众面前低头承认了自己的错误，但还是不彻底的、浮皮潦草的，必须继续深刻检查自己的思想。辅仁大学校长陈垣、北京大学副校长汤用彤、北京师范大学校长林砺儒、燕京大学新闻系主任蒋荫恩、历史系教授侯仁之、清华大学营建系主任梁思成、文学院院长金岳霖等，敢于在群众面前进行自我批评，揭露自己的错误，因而受到教师和同学们的欢迎。
    经过这一次严重、激烈的思想斗争，北京市高等学校的教师在思想方面发生了显著的变化，即资产阶级思想已开始从它盘踞的地方倒下去了。绝大多数的教师已认识了群众的力量，认识了共产党的正确领导，也认识了思想改造的伟大意义。他们切身体验到人民政府和共产党对他们的工作、前途是关怀的。有些过去在政治上很落后或是工作不负责任的教授，这次在群众的揭发批评之下，暴露了他们的错误，并有很多教授对自己的错误思想作了深刻检讨，表示要在以后的工作中间决心改正。
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争中，各校、各院系及教授间的本位主义和派系间互相排斥的丑态被公开地揭露出来，并受到了批判，大学中的家长作风也被打倒了。例如北京师范大学教育系教授间，长期闹不团结，互相打击，“一个教授，一座山头”，在教师学习期间，“你说你的一套，我说我的一套”，结果四分五裂，陷于混乱状态，使学习毫无收获。在这次运动中，这种闹不团结、勾心斗角的丑态被公开揭露出来了。保育系三个主要教授争权夺利，勾心斗角，抢当系主任、学术私有等恶劣作风也被揭发了。北京农业大学农业化学系宗派斗争的现象，更是严重，这次运动中被尽情地揭露了。
    在反贪污斗争中，各校揭露了大量的贪污事实。贪污分子中不仅有职员，而且还有教授和系主任。有的受贿，有的盗窃国家资财；有的窃取人民助学金和招生费；有的出卖试题；有的盗卖图书、仪器、药品和其他器材。各校有重点地、有步骤地向贪污分子发动了进攻。对那些坦白比较彻底的贪污分子，领导方面都给予从宽的处理；而对于拒绝坦白的贪污分子，各校都召开了群众性的斗争大会或交由政府逮捕法办。这些事实把“学校是‘清水衙门’”的说法驳倒了。
    在反浪费斗争中，各校都举行了反浪费展览会。最近北京市高等学校节约检查委员会又举办了全市高等学校反浪费展览会。通过展览会，不仅揭露了各校行政领导方面的官僚主义，揭露了宗派主义、本位主义和资产阶级自私自利的思想，也揭露了亲美、崇美的思想。在北京大学工学院，仓库里积压着大批的国家工业部门所急需的机器和工业用器材，但是院的行政领导人却不愿或拒绝把某些机器借给国家建设部门。北京工业学院在建设“延安大楼”中，由于领导方面的官僚主义，被奸商盗窃了二十多亿元。在中国协和医学院和北京大学医学院的仓库里积存着大批的朝鲜前线所急需的药品和医疗器材，有的已经霉烂失效了，有的已经损坏了。燕京大学把可用二十多年的玻璃管当作“命根子”似地囤积起来，舍不得用，为什么呢？因为它是“美国货”。北京大学、清华大学的图书馆里还保存着不少黄色的、反动的书刊。例如清华大学图书馆就摆着内容极端反动的歌颂法西斯罪魁的“我的奋斗”、“墨索里尼传”，让它们散布思想毒素；而大批新的政治书籍却被捆扎起来，埋藏在仓库里。在展览期中，各校都组织教师、同学前往参观，使每一个人对浪费现象激起了憎恨和仇视的情绪，树立起爱护国家、人民财产的观念，提高了教师、同学对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的认识和斗争情绪。北京农业大学昆虫系有一个教授在看了校内的反浪费展览会以后说：“看了初步检查的结果，痛心之极，对自己造成的罪恶尤为痛恨。”该校农业化学系一个教授在看了校内反浪费展览会以后检讨说：“我想起争经费争得面红耳赤的情景，大把地抓来，又大把地花去，实在使我寝食不安。”
    北京高等学校反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的经验证明，要把这个斗争搞彻底，首先领导方面必须表示决心，公开宣布一定要把学校中的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动进行到底，必须把高等学校里的资产阶级思想加以清除，树立起工人阶级的思想。其次，必须充分发扬民主，发动全校的师生员工，尤其是发动并运用同学的力量，自下而上地进行揭露和批评（大胆地公开地揭露，严肃地尖锐地批评）。第三，必须培养大批的积极分子，使他们成为推动运动前进的骨干。第四，由于斗争的复杂性，必须加强对运动的领导。要是没有一个坚强的战斗指挥部，斗争是不可能取得胜利的。当运动展开以后，领导方面必须抓住思想斗争这个环节，决不能放松，因为思想斗争是这个运动的主要方面。
    目前，北京市各大学正在把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动引向更激烈、更深入的阶段，从三方面对资产阶级思想进行坚决的斗争。一方面是思想斗争，通过这场伟大的斗争，把盘踞在学校中的资产阶级思想加以清除，以确立工人阶级思想的领导。这是斗争的主要方面。一方面是反贪污斗争，继续对贪污分子进行围攻，把他们搜索净尽，不到完全胜利，决不休止。再一方面是反浪费斗争，用已经揭发出来的大量的浪费事实向全校工作人员和同学进行教育，使他们清楚地认识官僚主义、资产阶级思想和亲美、崇美思想的严重危害性。
