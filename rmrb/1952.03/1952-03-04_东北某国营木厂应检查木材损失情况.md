    Northeast State-Owned Lumber Mill Should Investigate Timber Losses

    Editor: According to the confession of Qiu Youshi, a cadre of the Tianjin Municipal机关 Production Management Office, when he illegally purchased timber from a state-owned lumber mill in Northeast China for Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, he originally purchased 4,000 cubic meters of timber from the mill. However, due to the irresponsibility of the mill's management personnel, he secretly loaded an additional 30 cubic meters (worth over two million yuan per cubic meter) during loading, causing a loss of over 60 million yuan to the state. I believe that the relevant responsible cadres of this lumber mill should examine their serious bureaucratic work style and conduct a comprehensive investigation into the timber losses of the entire mill. The railway departments responsible for transportation, which did not detect the extra 30 cubic meters of timber being transported, should also conduct an investigation.

    东北某国营木厂应检查木材损失情况
    编辑同志：据天津机关生产管理处干部仇有石坦白，他替刘青山、张子善去东北国营木厂非法盗买木材时，原向某厂盗买木材四千立方公尺，因厂方管理人员不负责任，在装车时，他又偷偷的多装了三十立方公尺（每立方公尺合二百多万元），使国家遭受了六千多万元的损失。我认为：这个木厂的有关负责干部，应检查自己的严重的官僚主义作风，并应对全厂木材的损失，作一全面检查。铁路负责运输的部门，多运输三十立方公尺的木材竟未发觉，也应作检查。
