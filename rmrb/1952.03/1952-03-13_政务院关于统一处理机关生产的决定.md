The Government Administration Council’s Decision on the Unified Handling of 机关 Production
(Passed at the 126th Government Administration Council Meeting on February 29, 1952)
(Promulgated on March 12, 1952)

Due to the past revolutionary war being conducted in a dispersed rural environment and under protracted conditions, 机关 production once played a certain positive role in promoting production and supporting the war, and solved many of the living difficulties of staff in various units at that time. However, this need has gradually diminished since the revolutionary war achieved nationwide victory. The decentralization and blindness of 机关 production, on the other hand, have come into conflict with the centralization and planning of the national economy. In particular, the erosion of bourgeois ideology has caused many state personnel to divert their energies, indulge in 机关 production, pursue profits, and covet enjoyment, leading to serious corruption and waste. This has become the most widespread problem that must be resolved in the current nationwide struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Based on these reasons, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government now decides to end 机关 production and stipulates the following measures:

One: All government at all levels, the People's Liberation Army, schools, parties, people's organizations, and their subordinate departments and units engaged in industrial, agricultural, commercial, construction, and transportation industries, etc., excluding farms operated by reclamation troops, vegetable gardens cultivated by troops and office staff for their own consumption (without hiring workers) within the scope delineated by the government, production enterprises run by relief agencies for relief work and public security and judicial departments for reforming criminals with the approval of the government at the same level, and agencies' consumer cooperatives managed by cooperative system at all levels (cooperatives in name but actually agency stores are not subject to this limit), shall be registered and cleaned up by the agency production processing committees organized by governments at all levels (central, great administrative region, province (city), special district, county). Counties, because of small agency production scale and few systems, if there is no need to set up an agency, the agency production can be unified and taken over by the agencies designated by the county people's government, without the need to organize an agency production processing committee separately.

Two: The agency production processing committees at all levels are mainly composed of the governments at all levels, absorbing representatives from the army logistics departments and relevant parties and people's organizations. The committee is under the leadership of the government at the same level, and a secretariat is set up under it to handle the registration, classification, and cleanup of agency production.

When taking over, the agency production processing committees at all levels must first rely on various systems (such as the military, finance and economics, parties, and people's organizations) to organize branches of the agency production processing committee, and carry out the work separately under their unified leadership. The agency production processing work of the military system can be carried out at the three levels of the Military Commission, the military region, and the provincial military region, and participate separately in the agency production processing committees of the people's government at the same level.

For the issue of unified disposal of agency production, the head of each unit must personally control it, designate a special person to be responsible, or select appropriate personnel to participate in the agency production processing committee at all levels or the branch of agency production processing committee of each system, to ensure that the clearing and handover work can be completed well.

Three: All agency production enterprises’ investment, regardless of its source, whether invested in any department in the name of agency production or in partnership with private individuals, its funds shall be subject to the unified disposal of agency production processing committees at all levels, and no withdrawal is allowed, otherwise severe punishment will be given.

Four: All agency production income, from the date of promulgation of this decision, no withdrawal is allowed, otherwise severe punishment will be given.

Five: The agency production of each level, each system, and each unit, before being transferred to the relevant competent departments of the government enterprises, shall be managed by the original competent unit, operate as usual, and not be slackened, not damaged, and no funds, materials, equipment, cash and houses, etc., shall be drawn or transferred, and no cadres and personnel shall be transferred, otherwise severe punishment will be given.

Six: After the agency production processing committees at all levels register and clean up the agency production enterprises within their jurisdiction, they should submit a disposal report, report to the government at the same level for review, and the relevant competent departments designated by the government at the same level will take over separately. If the government at the same level cannot make a decision, the government at each level should forward it to the higher-level government for decision.

The agency production processing committees at all levels, for agency production enterprises outside their jurisdiction, may report to the higher-level agency production processing committee to instruct the agency production processing committee in the location of agency production enterprises to register and clean up. The agency production processing committees in various places must make a detailed report on the agency production enterprises taken over from other places and submit processing opinions, and execute them after being approved by the higher-level agency production processing committee.

After the agency production enterprises at all levels are transferred to the relevant competent departments designated by the government, they can be regarded as central or local state-owned enterprises according to their leadership relationship and enterprise nature, and the original management unit shall no longer interfere. Their management methods and financial systems are the same as those of state-owned enterprises. The agency production enterprises taken over at the special district level are regarded as provincial state-owned enterprises, and the special district is entrusted to manage them on behalf of the province.

Seven: When handling the handover of agency production, each level, each system, and each unit must be responsible by the head of the unit to completely explain the funds (including the source of funds), materials, equipment, houses, cash, cadres and all staff of their respective agency production, and there shall be no transfer, ambush, discount, etc. under any name, those who violate will be punished as corruption. The responsible receiving department must send personnel to carefully count and check to avoid errors during acceptance. After the handover between the two parties, the handover list should be signed by both parties and reported to the Central agency production processing committee.

When handling the handover, each unit must prepare four copies each of the complete property catalog and the list of cadres and personnel: one copy is retained by the original enterprise unit, one copy is handed over to the local agency production processing committee (transferred to the government at the same level when the work is completed), one copy is reported to the higher level of the original system for record, and one copy is used as the handover list between the two parties in the previous paragraph.

Eight: Within one month after the governments of the great administrative regions, provinces (cities), special districts, and counties receive the enterprises and units of each agency production, they should prepare a plan for the profit depreciation income of each enterprise after the takeover in 1952 and include it in this year's budget, and submit it to the higher-level financial department for review. Among them, except for the special district and county levels of income, which should be included in the provincial income (the income of the agency production enterprises in townships and towns is still managed by the county and not included in the provincial income), other incomes are included in the financial income of each level.

Nine: The cash and materials accumulated over the years by governments, armies, schools, parties, people's organizations at all levels and their subordinate departments and units (commonly known as "small public affairs"), except for those that are uniformly received by the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission and handed over to the Central Treasury in the army system, as well as those invested in agency enterprises or operated in partnership with private individuals in accordance with the provisions of Article 3, shall be turned over to the public, and a list shall be prepared uniformly, and classified according to the principles of the three-level financial revenue and expenditure system, and received separately by the Central Ministry of Finance, the Financial Department of the Great Administrative Region, and the Financial Department (Bureau) of the province (city), as the financial income of the Central and Great Administrative Regions, and provinces (cities). The "small public affairs" at the county level, of which the township and town fiscal revenue and expenditure part, still act as township and town fiscal revenue, under the unified management of the county.

The specific procedures for receiving the "small public affairs" of agencies at all levels are prescribed by the Central Ministry of Finance.

Ten: After governments, armies, schools, parties, people's organizations at all levels and their subordinate departments and units hand over agency production and "small public affairs", the nurseries, clinics, etc., originally run by agency production and "small public affairs" shall all be maintained unchanged, and their expenses shall be uniformly regulated by the financial departments at all levels. Due to the difficulties in agency expenditure that occurred in taking over agency production and "small public affairs," such as personnel living allowances, agency welfare subsidies, family relief, medical expenses, etc., shall be resolved by the financial departments at all levels in a unified manner. The methods will be notified separately.

Eleven: The agency production of each level, each system, and each unit is generally limited to being handed over before April 30 of this year.

Twelve: The agency production processing committees at the three levels of the Central Government, the Great Administrative Region, and the province (city) shall report the progress of the agency production work to the Government Administration Council once every half month, and make a summary report after the work is completed.

    政务院关于统一处理机关生产的决定
    （一九五二年二月二十九日政务院第一百二十六次政务会议通过）
    （一九五二年三月十二日发布）
    由于过去革命战争在农村分散的环境中和持久的条件下进行，机关生产曾经起过它推动生产、支援战争的一定的积极作用，并解决了当时各单位工作人员生活上的不少困难。但这种需要，自从革命战争取得了全国胜利以后，业已逐渐减少，而机关生产的分散和盲目性，对于国家经济的集中和计划性说来，又已发生抵触，尤其是资产阶级思想的侵蚀，致使许多国家工作人员分散精力，沉溺于机关生产之中，追逐利润，贪图享受，引起严重的贪污、浪费现象，这更成为目前全国反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中最普遍而必须解决的问题。基于这些原因，中央人民政府政务院现决定结束机关生产，并规定办法如下：
    一、所有各级人民政府、人民解放军、学校、党派、人民团体及其所属各部门、各单位所经营的工业、农业、商业、建筑业、交通运输业等机关企业，除屯垦部队经营的农场、部队和机关工作人员为自己消费而由自己动手（不雇佣工人）在政府划定的范围内耕作的菜园、救济机关为办救济事业和公安司法部门为改造犯人经同级政府批准经营的生产事业及由各级合作社系统管理的机关消费合作社（名为合作社而实际是机关商店者不在此限）以外，一律由各级人民政府（中央、大行政区、省（市）、专区、县）组织机关生产处理委员会予以登记和清理。县因机关生产不大和系统不多，如无设立处理机构的必要者，即可由县人民政府指定的机关统一接管，不另组织机关生产处理委员会。
    二、各级机关生产处理委员会，以各级人民政府为主，吸收军队后勤部门及有关党派和人民团体的代表组成之。委员会受同级人民政府领导，其下设秘书处，办理机关生产的登记、分类、清理等事务。
    各级机关生产处理委员会，在接管时得先依靠各系统（如军队、财经、党派、人民团体）组织机关生产处理委员会分会，在其统一领导下分别进行工作。军事系统的机关生产处理工作，可分军委、大军区、省军区三级进行，并分别参加各该级人民政府的机关生产处理委员会。
    各单位对于统一处理机关生产的问题，必须由首长亲自掌握，指定专人负责，或并选派适当人员参加各级机关生产处理委员会或各系统的机关生产处理委员会分会，以保证清理和交接工作能够很好地完成。
    三、一切机关生产的企业投资，不论其来源如何，不论以机关生产名义或其他名义投入任何部门或与私人合伙经营者，其资金均应听候各级机关生产处理委员会统一处理，一律不准提取，违者定予严惩。
    四、一切机关生产的收入，自本决定公布之日起，一律不准提取，违者定予严惩。
    五、各级、各系统、各单位的机关生产，在未移交政府有关企业的主管部门接管以前，一律由原主管单位负责管理，照常经营，不得松懈，不得损坏，不得抽动或转移资金、物资、设备、现金和房屋等，不得调动干部人员，违者定予严惩。
    六、各级机关生产处理委员会，对所管地区范围内机关生产的企业进行登记和清理完毕后，应提出处理报告，报同级政府审查，并由同级政府指定有关企业的主管部门分别予以接管。其同级政府不能决定者，应由各该级政府转报上级政府决定。
    各级机关生产处理委员会，对其所管地区范围以外的机关生产的企业，可报由上级机关生产处理委员会责成各该机关生产的企业所在地机关生产处理委员会予以登记和清理。各地机关生产处理委员会对接管别地的机关生产的企业，须做详细报告并提出处理意见，报经上级机关生产处理委员会批准后执行。
    各级机关生产的企业，在移交政府指定的有关企业的主管部门接管后，即可按其领导关系和企业性质，分别作为中央的或地方的国营企业，原管理单位即不得再行过问。其管理方法和财务制度，均与国营企业同。专区一级接管的机关生产的企业，作为省属国营企业，委托专区代管。
    七、各级、各系统、各单位，在办理机关生产移交工作时，须由首长负责将各自机关生产的资金
    （包括资金来源）、物资、设备、房屋、现金、干部和一切工作人员等全部交代清楚，不得有假借任何名义进行转移、埋伏、折扣等情事，违者以贪污论处。负责接管部门在接收时，须派员详细清点核算，避免错误。双方交接后，应将交接清册由双方签字层报中央机关生产处理委员会。
    各单位在办理交接时，须造具全部财产目录及干部人员名册各四份：一份留原企业单位，一份交当地机关生产处理委员会（工作结束时移交同级政府），一份报送原系统的上级备案，一份作为前款的双方交接清册。
    八、大行政区、省（市）、专区、县政府于接收各机关生产的企业单位完毕后一个月内，应造具接管后各该企业的一九五二年度利润折旧收入计划，并列入本年度预算，报请上级财政部门审核。其中除专区和县两级收入应列入省收入（乡镇机关生产的企业，其收入仍归县管理，不列为省收入）外，其他均列为各级的财政收入。
    九、各级人民政府、军队、学校、党派、人民团体及其所属各部门、各单位历年积累的现金和物资
    （通称“小公家务”），除军队系统统一由军委总后勤部接收交中央金库、以及投入机关企业或与私人合伙经营者照第三条规定办理外，一律归公，并应一律造具清册，按三级财政收支系统划分的原则，分别由中央财政部、大行政区财政部、省（市）财政厅（局）接收，作为中央的和大行政区的、省（市）的财政收入。县一级的“小公家务”其中属于乡镇财政收支部分，仍作为乡镇财政收入，由县统筹支配。
    接收各机关“小公家务”的具体手续，由中央财政部规定之。
    十、各级人民政府、军队、学校、党派、人民团体及其所属各部门、各单位在交出机关生产和“小公家务”后，其原由机关生产和“小公家务”所办的托儿所、医疗所等，均一律维持不变，并由各级财政部门统一规定其经费开支办法。由于接收机关生产和“小公家务”，机关开支发生的困难，如人员生活补助、机关福利补助、家属救济、医药费等，由各级财政部门统筹解决。其办法均另行通知。
    十一、各级、各系统、各单位的机关生产，一般限于本年四月三十日以前交接完毕。
    十二、中央、大行政区、省（市）三级机关生产处理委员会，每半月应将处理机关生产工作进行情况向政务院报告一次，并于工作完毕后作一总结报告。
