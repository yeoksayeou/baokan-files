(4) When Luo Shengjiao saw someone fall into the water, he rushed towards that place. He took off his cotton-padded clothes as he ran.
(5) Luo Shengjiao ran to the ice hole and jumped in without hesitation to rescue the Korean boy who had fallen into the water.
(6) In the severe cold of minus twenty degrees, he immersed himself in the icy water twice in a row, but couldn't find Choi Young. He poked his head out of the water to quickly catch his breath, then dove back in. He found Choi Young on his third try. He tried several times to lift Choi Young to the surface, but because the ice around the hole was too thin, the ice would break as soon as Choi Young climbed up, and Choi Young would fall back into the water.
