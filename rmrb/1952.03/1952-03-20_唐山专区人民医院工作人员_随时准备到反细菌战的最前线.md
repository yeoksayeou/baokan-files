    Staff of Tangshan Special District People's Hospital
    Stand Ready to Go to the Forefront of the Anti-Bacterial Warfare
    The crime of bacteriological warfare waged by American imperialism has been unanimously condemned by all peace-loving people around the world. All of us in the hospital have taken action to fight back against the shameless atrocities of the American aggressors. We are ready and waiting, ready to answer the call of the motherland and go to the forefront of the anti-bacterial war to fight.
    In order to realize our wishes, we hope that the relevant leaders will approve our going to the front lines to participate in the battle as soon as possible, and dedicate our greatest strength to the motherland; we must practice our epidemic prevention skills; help the non-medical staff of our hospital learn epidemic prevention skills; and constantly publicize epidemic prevention knowledge and the atrocities of American imperialism to the masses.
    All staff of the People's Hospital of Tangshan Special District, Hebei Province

    随时准备到反细菌战的最前线
    美帝国主义撒布细菌的罪行，已经遭到全世界爱好和平人民一致的声讨。我们全院同志们已经行动起来，回击美国侵略者的无耻暴行。我们已整装待发，随时听从祖国呼唤，到反细菌战的最前线去战斗。
    为了实现我们的愿望，我们希望有关领导方面早日批准我们走上前线参加战斗，把我们最大的力量献给祖国；我们要练好防疫技术；帮助本院非医务人员学好防疫技术；随时向群众宣传防疫知识和美帝国主义暴行。
