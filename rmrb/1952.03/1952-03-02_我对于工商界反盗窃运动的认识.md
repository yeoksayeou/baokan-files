My Understanding of the Anti-Theft Movement in Industrial and Commercial Circles
Fu Huating, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce

Since Chairman Mao called for the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the great struggle waged on two fronts—within governments at all levels across the country and within national industrial and commercial circles—is essentially a resolute counter-offensive against the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the working class over the past three years. This counter-offensive not only urges the bourgeoisie to accelerate its transformation and advance along the path of New Democracy but is also a social reform movement that changes customs and habits. Therefore, as the movement develops and history evolves, its great significance will become increasingly apparent.

(1) Industrial and Commercialists Should Deeply Recognize Their Crimes of Attacking the People

Since the vigorous launch of the anti-theft movement in industrial and commercial circles, the discovered crimes of unscrupulous merchants have fully demonstrated the bourgeoisie's essence of seeking profit at all costs, harming others to benefit themselves, and engaging in speculation and trickery. They have formed a front to attack the people, using every opportunity and means to harm the interests of the country and the people, even losing their conscience and viciously plotting against the Volunteers and sabotaging national defense construction projects. Shouldn't this be met with a resolute counterattack? Ironclad facts have proven that all major embezzlers were lured into the water by unscrupulous merchants through despicable means to achieve their goals of reaping exorbitant profits. The incidents of unscrupulous merchants cutting corners and sabotaging construction are even more widespread. The price fluctuations caused by their theft of economic intelligence—if the state-owned economy did not have sufficient materials to supply the people's needs, what serious harm would it cause to the people! In the past three years, the amount of state assets stolen by unscrupulous merchants in state processing orders and purchases is even more alarming. Some even believe that "processing orders in 1950 were the government taking care of industry and commerce, and in 1951, we were taking care of the government." Is it permissible to ungratefully compete with the state-owned economy for leadership and vainly attempt unlimited free development? The serious crimes of all unscrupulous merchants have been successively exposed in newspapers, arousing the people's immense indignation. Industrial and commercial circles must deeply recognize the severity of their crimes.

(2) Industrial and Commercialists Should Thoroughly Transform Themselves in the Anti-Theft Movement

Beijing's industrial and commercial circles are in the midst of an intense anti-theft movement, and industrial and commercialists have realized that obeying the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy is the only way to thoroughly transform themselves. Since December of last year to January 12th of this year, the Beijing industrial and commercial circles were in the stage of in-depth publicity for the anti-theft movement. Although the publicity work has become known to every household, the industrial and commercial circles have only confessed to trivial matters. The period around the Spring Festival was a stage of intense denunciation and confession. Due to the city's Thrift Inspection Committee forming a large number of inspection teams to conduct in-depth inspections of industrial and commercial households, and the People's Government arresting illegal merchants and exposing their crimes, the industrial and commercial circles were then forced to confess their crimes and began to choose the path of light. Most recognized the following truths: thorough confession and sincere repentance will be treated leniently by the government; otherwise, they will destroy themselves. Therefore, major cases and relatively complete confession materials have greatly increased, and the movement has reached a climax. The current stage is the stage where the vast ranks of the working class resolutely urge the illegal bourgeoisie to make a thorough confession. Face-to-face reasoning and struggle meetings have made it impossible for illegal capitalists to conceal their crimes. Under the circumstances of the working class pursuing victory and relentlessly pursuing, the industrial and commercial circles have no choice but to thoroughly confess, bow their heads and admit their guilt to the working class. This struggle fully demonstrates the superiority of the people's democratic dictatorship system led by the proletariat. Through such reasoning and struggle meetings, illegal capitalists realize that only by obeying the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy can they find a path to self-renewal. Within the enterprise, only by suppressing the arrogant arrogance of the bourgeoisie, establishing the prestige of the working class, explaining the principles clearly to the capitalists, distinguishing right from wrong, implementing democratic reforms, and making a general reckoning of all the past crimes of illegal capitalists can a mutually beneficial relationship between labor and capital be truly established.

Such movement development is normal and should be the case. All illegal industrialists and businessmen, except for a few extremely heinous unscrupulous merchants, will mostly be treated leniently. All reasoning and struggle meetings are precisely to save illegal industrialists and businessmen who can be saved, so that they can put down their heavy burdens, acknowledge the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, follow the path of New Democracy, and follow the people of the whole country towards socialism.

It is undeniable that there are still some industrialists and businessmen who hold the idea of getting by, pretending to bow their heads and admit their guilt to the working class in order to get through the ordeal and then engage in passive management; some are still stubbornly resisting and are extremely dishonest. We must sternly warn these people: Only by actively transforming ourselves under the leadership of the working class, abiding by the Common Program, and engaging in the economic construction of New Democracy will we be qualified to follow the people of the whole country into socialism; only by gradually and thoroughly eliminating the decadent and corrupt thoughts of the bourgeoisie, and taking Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as our guiding ideology and work guidelines, will we have a future. All decadent and reactionary ideas are not allowed to exist. Today, the counter-offensive launched by the working class against the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie points out a bright and correct path for all illegal industrialists and businessmen who have the possibility of transformation. Every industrialist and businessman should follow the path indicated by the working class.

(3) In the Future, Industrial and Commercial Circles Should Establish New Morality and New Work Style

This movement has played a positive role in improving the business style of industry and commerce in the future. In the past, industry and commerce in semi-colonial and semi-feudal China not only had inherent shortcomings, but also caused very serious harm to the interests of the people due to the bad practices of fraud and cutting corners. We request the government to ban industry and commerce that harms the people, guide industries that are not necessary for society to switch to other industries within a certain period of time, and reorganize and assist the development of industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, we should divide labor and cooperate, and each get what they deserve. Only in this way can we comply with Article 37 of the Common Program.

Premier Zhou instructed us: "We cannot advocate blind production, but must gradually realize the leadership of the national production general plan. Whether public or private, urban or rural, central or local, large or small, all must be gradually incorporated into the plan. Otherwise, blind production in industry and agriculture will lead to surplus and deficiency, and blind operation in commerce will disrupt the market and fluctuate prices." He also said: "We cannot allow exorbitant profits, but can only obtain legal profits within the limits prescribed or negotiated by the state." "We cannot allow illegal acts such as bribery, fraud, tax evasion, theft, and enticement to continue to occur, allowing them to erode the people's regime, damage state property, and corrupt state workers..." All these are principles that our industrial and commercial circles must abide by in establishing new morality and new work style in the future. Otherwise, violating the Common Program and policies and regulations, resisting the leadership of the state-owned economy and the national production plan, and running counter to the New Democratic economy, this behavior will undoubtedly be opposed by the people of the whole country and end in failure.

    我对于工商界反盗窃运动的认识
    北京市工商业联合会主任委员  傅华亭
    自从毛主席号召开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动以来，在全国各级人民政府内部和全国工商界两个战场上所进行的伟大斗争，本质上是针对资产阶级三年来向着工人阶级所举行的猖狂进攻来一个坚决的反攻。这个反攻不仅促使资产阶级加紧进行改造，必须循着新民主主义道路前进，同时也是一个移风易俗的社会改革运动，因此随着运动的发展和历史的演进，益将明显地证明其伟大意义。
    （一）工商业者应深刻认识进攻人民的罪行
    工商界反盗窃运动汹涌开展以来，仅就所发现的奸商罪行，已充分证明了资产阶级唯利是图，损人利己，投机取巧的本质。他们形成了一条向人民进攻的战线，他们利用一切机会，利用一切手段，危害国家和人民的利益，甚至丧尽天良，狠毒地暗害志愿军和破坏国防建设工程，这难道还不应该来一个坚决的反击么？铁一般的事实证明了，一切大贪污犯都是奸商们用卑鄙无耻手段勾引下水的，奸商们以此达到其牟取暴利的目的。奸商们不择手段的偷工减料破坏建设的事件，更是普遍的现象。他们盗窃经济情报所引起的几度物价波动，如果国营经济没有充分的物资以供应人民的需要，那会给人民以多么严重的损害！三年来在国家加工定货和收购中，奸商盗窃国家资财的数字，更为惊人，甚至有人认为“加工定货在一九五○年是政府照顾工商业，在一九五一年是我们照顾政府”了。忘恩负义地和国营经济争夺领导权，妄想无限制地自由发展，难道这是应该允许的么？一切奸商的严重罪行，业经报纸陆续揭露，这引起了人民的无比愤恨，工商界必须深刻认识其罪行的严重。
    （二）工商业者应在反盗窃运动中彻底改造自己
    北京市工商界正处在紧张的反盗窃运动中，工商业者已经认识到服从工人阶级和国营经济的领导，是彻底改造自己的唯一途径。自从去年十二月至本年一月十二日，是北京市工商界反盗窃运动的深入宣传阶段，宣传工作虽已家喻户晓，但工商界还只坦白了些鸡毛蒜皮的事情。春节前后，是紧张检举坦白的阶段，由于市节约检查委员会组成大批检查组深入工商户检查，人民政府并逮捕了不法商人，暴露了他们的罪行，这以后，工商界始被迫坦白自己的罪行，开始选择光明的道路，大部分认清了下述的道理：彻底坦白真诚悔过就能得到政府宽大处理，否则是毁灭自己。因此重大案件和比较完整的坦白材料，才大大增加，运动走向高潮。目前阶段是广大工人阶级的队伍坚决促使违法资产阶级彻底坦白的阶段。面对面的说理斗争大会已使违法资本家无从掩饰其罪行。在工人阶级乘胜穷追的形势下，工商界只有彻底交代，向工人阶级低头认罪，别无道路可走。这场斗争，充分显示了无产阶级领导的人民民主专政制度的优越性。通过了这样的说理斗争大会，使违法资本家认识到只有服从工人阶级和国营经济的领导，才是自新之路。对企业内部而论，也惟有把资产阶级嚣张气焰压下去，树立起工人阶级的威风，向资本家讲清道理，分清是非，实行民主改革，对过去违法资本家的一切罪行来一个总清算，才能真正树立劳资两利的关系。
    这样的运动发展是正常的，也是应该的。一切违法的工商业者，除去一部分罪大恶极的奸商外，大部分是会获得宽大处理的。一切说理斗争大会正是为了挽救可以挽救的违法工商业者，使他们放下沉重包袱，承认工人阶级和国营经济的领导，遵循新民主主义的道路，并追随全国人民走向社会主义。
    无可讳言的，还有一部分工商业者抱着过关思想，向工人阶级伪装低头认罪，以便过关之后来个消极经营；有的则还在顽强抗拒，表现极不老实。我们要正告这些人们：只有在工人阶级领导下，积极改造自己，遵守共同纲领，从事新民主主义的经济建设，才会有资格追随全国人民进入社会主义；只有逐步彻底肃清资产阶级堕落腐化的思想，以马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想作为领导思想和工作指针，才有我们的前途，凡是腐朽反动的思想，都是不允许存在的。今天工人阶级向资产阶级猖狂进攻所举行的反攻，给予一切有改造可能的违法工商业者，指出一条光明正确的道路，每一个工商业者都应该遵循工人阶级所指示的道路前进。
    （三）今后工商界应树立新道德和新作风
    这次运动，对今后工商业经营作风的改善，是起了积极作用的。过去半殖民地半封建的工商业，不但存在着先天不足的现象，更由于欺诈和偷工减料的恶劣作风，对人民利益的危害是非常严重的。我们要求政府，对危害人民的工商业，应予取缔，对社会不必要的行业，在一定时期内指导其转业，对有益于国计民生的工商业，应加以改组并辅助其发展，在国营经济的领导下，分工合作，各得其所。这样才能符合共同纲领第三十七条的规定。
    周总理指示我们：“不能提倡盲目生产，而一定要逐步实现国家生产总计划的领导，无论公与私，城与乡，中央和地方，大公与小公，都必须逐步纳入计划，否则，工农业的盲目生产，就会发生过剩与不足，商业的盲目经营，就会扰乱市场，波动物价。”又说：“不能容许暴利，而只能在国家规定的限度或议定价格内取得合法利润。”“不能容许行贿，欺诈，偷漏，盗窃，引诱等犯法行为继续发生，听其侵蚀人民政权，损害国家财产，腐蚀国家工作人员……”凡此都是我们工商界今后树立新道德和新作风必须遵守的原则，否则违背共同纲领和政策法令，抵抗国营经济和国家生产计划的领导，和新民主主义的经济背道而驰，这种行为必将遭受全国人民的反对而归于失败无疑。
