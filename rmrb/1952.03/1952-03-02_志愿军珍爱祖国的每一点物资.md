    The Chinese People's Volunteers Cherish Every Item of Supplies from the Motherland
    Zhao Degong, Representative of the Returning Chinese People's Volunteers
    On the Korean battlefield, whenever a batch of grain, clothing, and ammunition arrived at the front, the soldiers would point to them affectionately and say, "This is shipped from the motherland!" What rich emotions are contained in this sentence! At that time, we would naturally think of the distant motherland, of the people of the motherland working day and night to support the front, and of how the comrades on the transportation lines were working nervously under the harassment of enemy aircraft.
    Every tiny thing, once it reached the hands of the volunteer soldiers, would play its greatest role. Take a cigarette box, for example. What a tiny thing! But in the hands of the volunteer soldiers, it became very useful. They used both sides of a cigarette box to write two wall newspapers, and finally tore them off to use as cigarette paper. Sometimes they also used corn husks and large tree leaves to write wall newspapers. Soldiers couldn't bear to throw away clothes that were too rotten to wear anymore. They used them to make sock liners, gloves, and foot wraps. Among the exhibits we brought back to China this time, there is a pair of car tires covered with bullet holes, sent by the Second Company of a motor vehicle unit. The story happened at dawn on October 12th last year. After completing a long-distance grain transport mission, Comrade Ding Yi, the driver, had just driven the car to the campsite when it was spotted by enemy aircraft. A burst of bullets rained down, followed by several bombs. The car was hit, and Comrade Wu Tingfang, the assistant, was injured. At this time, Comrade Ding Yi disregarded everything and drove the car into a car shelter and put out the fire. After inspection, the front tire had twelve holes blown in it and seemed unusable. However, in order to protect the property of the motherland, Comrade Ding Yi tried every means to repair the tire, so that this pair of damaged tires, which had traveled more than 9,000 kilometers, traveled more than 8,000 kilometers more.
    The soldiers not only saved every bit of supplies shipped from the motherland, but also engaged in labor and creation with their own hands. In mid-November last year, there was a heavy snowfall. Soldiers of a certain unit began to build fortifications on a rocky mountain. The weather was so cold, and the stones were so hard, but the soldiers were not intimidated by the difficulties. They proposed: "The stones are hard, but our determination is even harder!" They dug day and night, the iron picks were worn down to a nub, some only had an iron lump left, and the few stone drills they had were all bent and dull. A large part of the fortifications remained unfinished. What should be done? The soldiers did not reach out to the motherland. They used canned food boxes to make bellows, bullet boxes to make stoves, and collected a large amount of scrap iron from mountain gullies and roadsides, using charcoal to start a fire and forge iron. With the tools solved, in order to catch up with the work, they dug all day and lit fires with pine oil at night to dig continuously. When the fortifications were completed, the soldiers happily danced in the fortifications. They cheered as they danced: "We have completed the task and saved the wealth of the motherland."

    志愿军珍爱祖国的每一点物资
    中国人民志愿军归国代表  赵德恭
    在朝鲜战场上，每当一批粮食、被服、弹药运到前方的时候，战士们就亲切地指着说：“这是从祖国运来的！”这句话包含着多么丰富的感情啊！当时我们总是很自然地想到遥远的祖国，想到支援前线日夜不停地工作着的祖国人民，想到在运输线上同志们是怎样在敌机袭扰下紧张地工作着。
    每一点微小的东西，到了志愿军战士们的手里，都会发挥它的最大作用。比如拿一个纸烟盒来说吧，这是多么微小的一件东西呀！但到了志愿军战士们的手里就成了很有用的东西了。他们用一个烟盒的两面写两次墙报，最后还揭下来作卷烟的纸。有时他们还用玉茭皮、大树叶来写墙报。烂的不能再穿的衣服，战士们是不忍心把它扔掉的，他们用来作成了袜底、手套、包脚布等。在这次我们带回国来的展览品里，有一对满布弹痕的汽车轮胎，这是汽车部队某部二连送来的。这个故事是发生在去年十月十二日拂晓，司机丁毅同志在完成长途运粮任务后，汽车刚刚驶到宿营地，被敌机发现了，一梭子子弹打了下来，接着就是几个炸弹。车被打着了，助手吴廷芳同志负伤了。这时丁毅同志不顾一切地把车开进了一个汽车荫蔽部，把火扑灭。经检查后，前胎被炸了十二个洞，看来已无法使用了。但是丁毅同志为了爱护祖国财产，想尽一切办法把胎补好，使这对行驶了九千多公里被炸坏的轮胎，又行驶了八千多公里。
    战士们不但一点一滴地节省着从祖国运来的物资，而且以自己的双手进行了劳动创造。去年十一月中旬，下了一场大雪，某部战士们在石头山上作起工事来。天是那样的冷，石头又是那样的硬，但战士们并没被困难吓倒，他们提出：“石头硬，我们的决心更硬！”他们日夜不息地挖着，铁镐磨秃了，有的只剩下一个铁疙瘩，仅有的几个石钻也都变成又秃又弯的了，工事还有很大部分未完成。怎么办呢？战士们并没有把手伸向祖国，他们用罐头箱作成了风箱，用子弹盒作成火炉，从山沟里、公路旁拾来大量的废铁，用木炭生起火打起铁来。工具解决了，他们为了赶工，白天挖一天，夜晚用松树熬成的油点起火来连夜地挖。工事挖成了，战士们高兴地在工事里跳起舞来。他们一边跳一边欢呼着：“我们完成了任务，还节省了祖国的财富。”
