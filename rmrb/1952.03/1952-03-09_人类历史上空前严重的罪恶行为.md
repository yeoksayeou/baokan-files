An Unprecedentedly Serious Crime in Human History
Huang Yanpei

In the third year of the American imperialists' war of aggression against Korea, after being badly beaten by the combined forces of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, they were forced to participate in armistice negotiations. Yet, wanting to save face, they deliberately delayed and refused to accept the armistice conditions. At this time, they recklessly resorted to extremely cruel and vicious means, using bacteriological weapons, prepared over a long period and manufactured on a large scale, against our army's positions and the residents of the rear, creating an unprecedentedly serious crime in human history.

From January 28th, American imperialism repeatedly and continuously used airplanes to scatter various insects carrying infectious germs over various parts of Korea.

From February 29th, American imperialism, going all the way, again used airplanes repeatedly and continuously to frantically spread the same various germ-carrying insects over the northeastern regions within our country's borders, just as they did in various parts of Korea, and indiscriminately bombed and strafed.

American imperialism also used howitzers to fire bacteriological shells at our army's positions.

These heinous and cruel acts of American imperialism are nothing more than a vain attempt to salvage the already doomed defeat of its Korean war situation. Little does it know that this is absolutely impossible.

On the contrary, these heinous and cruel acts of American imperialism have greatly aroused the boundless anger of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who are fiercely fighting it and winning every battle. They have greatly aroused the intense hatred of the Korean people, who are fervently supporting the front lines. At the same time, they have greatly enraged the Chinese people and people's organizations throughout the country, who have risen up together, determined to dedicate all their strength to completely crush the aggressors' conspiracies and sinister schemes. In addition, they have enraged many patriotic scientists and medical workers, who have unanimously mobilized to prepare for the prevention and control of infectious germs and poisonous insects, and are going to the front lines in large numbers to carry out extensive detoxification work. They are jointly organizing an incomparably powerful force and contributing this force to annihilate the inhuman and inhumane American imperialism, and will not stop until they achieve their goal.

These heinous and cruel acts of American imperialism, as a result of the accusation made by the China Peace Committee against American Aggression to the World Peace Council, have made the peace-loving people of the world understand that they are not only the massacre of peaceful residents and the armed forces of China and Korea, but also the most dangerous enemy of the whole world and all mankind. Just seeing its unprovoked poisoning of peaceful residents in the northeastern regions of China is an unquestionable indication that it is further preparing to launch another world war and that it is clearly posing a major threat to world peace and the safety of all mankind.

There is an ancient Chinese saying: "Condemned by a thousand, dies without disease." The meaning is: if subjected to the censure of the broad masses and hated by the broad masses, there is absolutely no hope of survival. American imperialism, which has committed inhuman and inhumane acts, has been unanimously hated and denounced by the peace-loving people of the world. I firmly believe that the more heinous crimes it commits, the sooner it will accelerate its own fate of failure and death.

Arise! People of the world who love peace, arise! Quickly encircle and quickly annihilate the American aggressors, the deadly enemy of mankind, who are frantically spreading poison germs and massacring peaceful people!

    人类历史上空前严重的罪恶行为
    黄炎培
    美国帝国主义者在发动对朝鲜侵略战争第三年，给朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军合力痛打得落花流水之后，不得已参加停战谈判，而又想顾全面子，故意拖延，不肯接受停战条件，这时候，竟不顾一切地施出极度残忍毒辣的手段，向我军阵地和后方居民，大量使用那经过长时期准备，大规模制造的细菌武器，创出人类历史上空前严重的罪恶行为。
    美帝国主义从一月二十八日起，一次又一次继续不断地向朝鲜各地用飞机散掷各种昆虫，这些昆虫，都带有传染病菌。
    二月二十九日起，美帝国主义一不做二不休，竟又用飞机一次又一次继续不断地向我国国境内东北各地区疯狂进行着和向朝鲜各地同样地撒放那各种昆虫细菌，并滥施轰炸扫射。
    美帝国主义又用榴弹炮向我军阵地发射细菌炮弹。
    美帝国主义这些穷凶极恶的残酷行为，无非是妄想挽救它朝鲜战局已经注定了的惨败，而那里知道这是绝对不可能的事。
    相反地美帝国主义这些穷凶极恶的残酷行为，已经大大地激起了正在和它狠命相拚，百战百胜的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的无比愤怒；已经大大地引起了正在狂热地支援前线的朝鲜人民的切齿痛恨；同时还大大地激怒了我中国全国人民和人民团体一齐站起来，决心献出自己所有力量，去彻底粉碎侵略者的阴谋毒计；中间还激怒了许多爱国的科学工作者，医务工作者一致动员起来，决心做好防治传染病菌毒虫的准备工夫，陆续到前线去大量地展开除毒工作，他们正在联合组织强大无比的一切力量，并把这力量贡献出来，定要歼灭那丧失人性灭绝人道的美帝国主义，不达目的不止。
    美帝国主义这些穷凶极恶的残酷行为，经中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会向世界和平理事会控诉的结果，使全世界爱好和平的人民一齐了解它不单是对中朝两国和平居民和中朝人民武装力量的虐杀，而且它是全世界全人类的最危险的敌人，只须看到它无缘无故地向中国东北各地区和平居民的毒杀，即是无可置疑地它在进一步准备发动另一次世界大战，它在明明白白地给全世界和平与全人类安全以重大威胁。
    中国有一句古代相传的名言：“千夫所指，无疾而死。”意思就是：如果遭受到广大群众的指责，给广大群众所痛恨，绝对不可能有生存的希望。干出丧失人性，灭绝人道，这些残忍行为的美帝国主义，已经给全世界爱好和平人民一致痛恨，一致声讨。我坚决相信它加多一天滔天的罪行，即将加速一天它自己的失败和死亡的命运。
    起来！全世界爱好和平的人民起来！快快去围攻，快快去歼灭那人类的死敌疯狂地散布毒菌，屠杀和平人民的美国侵略者！
