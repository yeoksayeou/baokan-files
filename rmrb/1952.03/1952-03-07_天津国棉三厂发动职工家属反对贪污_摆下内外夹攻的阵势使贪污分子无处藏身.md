    The State-owned Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Mill, while mobilizing workers to participate in the "tiger hunt" movement, also mobilized the families of all factory employees, setting up an internal and external pincer movement, leaving corrupt elements who devour state assets nowhere to hide.
    At the beginning of the movement, although the factory's family committee also mobilized the families to participate, they did not explain the policies to them. Therefore, the families only examined their own trivial issues such as wasting water and electricity and taking small advantages of public property, and were not concerned about the factory's anti-corruption struggle. The families of corrupt elements had even more concerns and even went to private merchants on behalf of their husbands to establish "offensive and defensive alliances." In view of this situation, the person in charge of the Chinese Communist Party branch of this factory convened a mobilization meeting for all factory employees' families, and the family committee also held several discussion meetings to repeatedly educate the families, calling on them to help their husbands or sons with corrupt behavior to confess and report corrupt elements. During the Spring Festival, they held an exhibition of "Workers' Homes" and invited families to visit. The first part of the exhibition used physical objects or pictures to specifically expose the harm of corrupt elements to the interests of the state and the people. In the second part, "Ideal Paradise," they focused on introducing the happy life of the Soviet people.
    After seeing the exhibition, everyone felt the happiness of future life and felt even more hatred for the corrupt elements who destroyed this happy life. The factory's CCP branch then led the family committee to form forty-six groups among more than 4,000 family members, holding meetings separately to encourage everyone to report and mobilize corrupt elements to confess. At these meetings, the families reported a total of 160 cases of corruption and provided many clues that could be traced.
    When the factory's Savings Inspection Committee issued an order to attack the corrupt elements of the mess hall, the forty-six family groups also held meetings separately and offered opinions to the mess hall one after another. When the employees' "tiger hunting" team attacked the payroll office, they submitted more than 70 materials and clues to the payroll office, which greatly helped the factory's anti-corruption struggle.
    In this situation of internal and external attack, the corrupt elements were greatly threatened. They felt that even their wives and children were "attacking" them, and they really couldn't hide, so they had to confess their corruption facts. Four corrupt elements in the factory confessed their corruption problems after being mobilized and urged by their families. Some corrupt elements had to explain the problems they confessed in the factory to their mothers or wives again after returning home. Wang Xintang's mother, a corrupt element, was told that her son did not confess the issue of the "offensive and defensive alliance," she said sternly to him: "Have you forgotten that when our family of five fled famine from Shandong, we didn't have quilts in the winter, and our wages weren't enough to eat soybean cakes? Now you eat rice and white flour, wear new cotton uniforms, and still want to be corrupt. You are corrupt and you don't confess. Did your conscience get eaten by dogs?"
    The families also formed inspection teams to help the factory investigate materials. Therefore, the factory's Savings Inspection Committee was very clear about every move of each corrupt element. They have recently uncovered the "offensive and defensive alliances" of five corrupt elements and investigated many powerful materials.

    天津国棉三厂发动职工家属反对贪污
    摆下内外夹攻的阵势使贪污分子无处藏身
    国营天津第三棉纺织厂在发动工人参加“打虎”运动中，同时发动了全厂的职工家属，摆下内外夹攻的阵势，使吞噬国家资财的贪污分子无处藏身。
    在运动开始时，这个厂的家属委员会虽然也发动了家属们参加，但是没有向她们讲明政策，因此，家属们只检讨自己的浪费水电和占公家小便宜等琐碎问题，对于全厂的反贪污斗争是不关心的。贪污分子的家属更有很多顾虑，甚至代替她丈夫去和私商订立“攻守同盟”。根据这种情况，这个厂的中国共产党的支部负责人就召开了全厂职工家属动员大会，家属委员会也分别召开了几次座谈会，向家属们反复进行教育，号召他们帮助有贪污行为的丈夫或儿子坦白，检举贪污分子。春节期间，他们举办了“工人之家”展览会，邀请家属前往参观。展览会的前一部分用实物或图画具体地揭露了贪污分子对国家、对人民利益的危害，后半部的“理想乐园”中，着重介绍了苏联人民的幸福生活。
    看了展览会后，大家都感到未来生活的幸福，对破坏这种美满生活的贪污分子更加感到憎恨。该厂中共支部就领导家属委员会在四千多名家属中，组成了四十六个小组，分别开会，鼓励大家检举和动员贪污分子坦白。在这些会上，家属们共检举出一百六十件贪污事实，并提出许多可以追查的线索。
    当该厂节约检查委员会发出命令向伙食团贪污分子进攻的时候，四十六个家属小组也分别开会，纷纷向伙食团提出意见。在职工“打虎”队向工账房进攻的时候，她们又对工账房提出了七十多件材料和线索，对于全厂的反贪污斗争有很大帮助。
    在这样内外夹攻的情形下，贪污分子受到很大威胁，他们感到连老婆孩子都向自己“进攻”，实在无法隐瞒了，因而不得不坦白了贪污事实。该厂有四个贪污分子就是经过家属动员督促后，坦白了自己的贪污问题的。有些贪污分子在回家以后，还得把自己在工厂中坦白出来的问题，向母亲或妻子再交代一遍。贪污分子王心堂的母亲听说儿子没把“攻守同盟”的问题交代清楚，就声色俱厉地对他说：“你难道忘了从前我们全家五口从山东逃荒来的时候，冬天没有被盖，工资不够吃豆饼的生活？现在你吃的是大米白面，穿的是新棉制服，还要贪污，贪污了还不坦白，你的良心叫狗吃啦？”
    家属们并且组成了检查组，帮助厂方调查材料。因此该厂节约检查委员会对每个贪污分子的一举一动都非常清楚。她们最近已经破获了五个贪污分子的“攻守同盟”，并调查出许多有力的材料。
