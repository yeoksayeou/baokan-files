Large Capitalist in Wuhan Arsoned to Defraud State Assets
Main Criminal Zhou Wuyi and Accomplice Guo Songshan Have Been Arrested
    More than 800 workers from the private Wuhan Sawmill and residents from the Xinghua Wharf fire zone in Wuhan gathered to denounce the criminals, capitalist Zhou Wuyi and Guo Songshan, who committed arson to defraud state property, resulting in the fire. The Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court accepted the just demands of the masses and arrested Zhou and Guo on the spot.
    After the truth of this conspiracy of arson was revealed, all the workers in the factory and nearby residents were extremely angry. They held an accusation meeting on the 13th. At the meeting, Xiao Shukun, Luo Zhilin, Zhang Zhengxing, workers of Wuhan Sawmill, and Wang Fenglian, Li Guiying, and other affected residents, angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the capitalists Zhou Wuyi and Guo Songshan. Zhang Zhengxing pointed at the capitalist and said, "That day, all of us workers were on holiday and not at the factory. After you set the fire, the next day you held a staff meeting, telling us to spread the word that the fire started in the shantytowns, and threatening those who dared to say that the fire started in the Wuhan Sawmill." Worker Luo Zhilin said, "When I heard that the factory was on fire, I felt very sad; but that night, the capitalist Zhou Wuyi took his mistress out dancing and shopping." The factory accountant Wang Changheng also exposed on the spot the fact that the capitalist asked him to falsify accounts after the fire. Li Guiying, a resident whose son was burned to death, accused: "The capitalist not only burned my son to death, but also made my whole family homeless." When the affected resident Wang Fenglian made her accusation, she sobbed and shouted, "The People's Government must avenge us!" The workers and residents present unanimously demanded the immediate arrest of the heinous capitalists Zhou Wuyi and Guo Songshan. The Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court immediately accepted the just demands of the masses and arrested the arsonists Zhou Wuyi and Guo Songshan, and will punish them according to the law.

    武汉市大奸商纵火诈骗国家资财
    主犯周武彝和同谋犯郭嵩山已被逮捕
    武汉市私营武汉锯木厂工人和兴华码头火灾区居民八百多人集会控诉纵火诈骗国家财产以致造成火灾的罪犯、奸商周武彝和郭嵩山。最高人民法院中南分院接受群众的正义要求，当场将周、郭二犯逮捕。
    这一阴谋纵火案的真相揭晓后，该厂全体工人和附近居民莫不愤怒万分，他们在十三日举行了控诉会。会上，武汉锯木厂工人萧树宽、罗治林、张正兴和被灾居民王凤莲、李桂英等都怒不可遏地控诉了奸商周武彝和郭嵩山的滔天罪行。张正兴指着奸商说：“那天我们工人都休假不在厂，你放火造成火灾后，第二天又召开职工大会，叫我们去宣传是棚户起的火，并叫我们威胁那些敢于说是武汉锯木厂起火的人。”工人罗治林说：“我听说厂里着了火，心里难受极了；奸商周武彝当晚却还带着他的姘妇去跳舞，逛街。”该厂会计汪长恒也当场揭穿了奸商在失火后叫他造假账的事实。被烧死儿子的居民李桂英控诉说：“奸商不仅烧死了我的儿子，而且使我们全家流离失所。”被灾居民王凤莲控诉时泣不成声，高呼：“人民政府要替我们报仇！”到会工人、居民们一致要求立即逮捕罪大恶极的奸商周武彝和郭嵩山。最高人民法院中南分院当即接受群众的正义要求，将放火凶犯周武彝、郭嵩山逮捕，将依法予以惩办。（据新华社消息）
