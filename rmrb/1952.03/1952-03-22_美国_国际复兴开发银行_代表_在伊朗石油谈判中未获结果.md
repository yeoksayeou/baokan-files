TASS, Sofia, March 18th: Negotiations held recently in Tehran between the Iranian government and representatives of the American so-called "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development" regarding Iranian oil have produced no results.

On March 16th, Dr. Shaigan, a member of parliament, a member of the Joint Oil Committee implementing the Oil Industry Nationalization Act, and a renowned Iranian jurist, delivered a speech on Tehran Radio. From his speech, it can be seen that the representatives of the "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development" requested the Iranian government to agree to invite British experts to manage and guide the Iranian oil industry.

The "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development" further demanded that the Iranian government should not regard the bank merely as a representative of the Iranian government engaged in activities under the control of the Iranian National Oil Company. The bank clearly indicated to the other party in the negotiations that it hoped to act not only as a representative of the Iranian government but also as the owner and master of Iranian oil. Shaigan acknowledged that the Americans had demanded that the Iranian government cede the rights of the former "Anglo-Iranian Oil Company" to the "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development," thereby abolishing the Oil Industry Nationalization Act.

The third item on the agenda for the negotiations concerned the price of Iranian oil.

Shaigan said that the Iranian government had rejected the above demands.

However, after the failure of the negotiations in Tehran, the pressure from the US imperialists has not ceased. Judging from the statements they have issued, the representatives of the American "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development" still intend to go to Tehran in the future.

    美国“国际复兴开发银行”代表
    在伊朗石油谈判中未获结果
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社索非亚十八日讯：伊朗政府和美国的所谓“国际复兴开发银行”的代表们最近在德黑兰举行的伊朗石油谈判，没有产生任何结果。
    三月十六日，议会议员、实行石油工业国有化法案的联合石油委员会委员、著名的伊朗法学家沙埃根博士在德黑兰电台发表演说。从他的演说里可以看出：“国际复兴开发银行”的代表们，曾要求伊朗政府同意邀请英国专家管理与指导伊朗石油工业。
    “国际复兴开发银行”还进一步要求伊朗政府不应该把这个银行仅仅看作在伊朗国家石油公司控制之下从事活动的伊朗政府的代表。这个银行在谈判中明确地向对方表示，它希望不仅作为伊朗政府的代表，而且还要作为伊朗石油的所有者和主人。沙埃根承认：美国人曾要求伊朗政府把前“英伊石油公司”的权利割让给“国际复兴开发银行”，从而废除石油工业国有化法案。
    谈判的第三项议程是关于伊朗石油价格的问题。
    沙埃根说，伊朗政府已拒绝了上述的要求。
    但是在德黑兰谈判失败后，美帝国主义者的压力并没有停止，从他们发表的声明里可以判断，美国“国际复兴开发银行”的代表们将来还想到德黑兰去。
