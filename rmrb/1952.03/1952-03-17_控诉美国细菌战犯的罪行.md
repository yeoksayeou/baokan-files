    Accuse the Crimes of American Bacterial Warfare Criminals
    To the Editor: We will never forget that the Japanese fascist bandits secretly set up a bacterial factory in Anda County in our province, spreading plague and other bacteria. My uncle and my three younger sisters died of plague. They are just a few of the countless victims.
    What the American devils are doing today is the same as what the Japanese fascist bandits did back then. We once again warn the American aggressors: Since the Japanese fascist bandits have been defeated by our great Chinese people, then the American aggressors will receive the most severe sanctions and punishment in the face of the even more powerful Sino-Korean people, who have the support of the people of the world!

    控诉美国细菌战犯的罪行
    编辑同志：我们永远没有忘掉，日本法西斯强盗们曾在我省安达县秘密设置细菌工厂，散布鼠疫等类细菌的罪行。我的老叔和我的三个胞妹，就是患鼠疫病死的。他们不过是无数被害者中的几个而已。
    今天美国鬼子的所作所为，就是当年日本法西斯强盗所干的勾当。我们再一次警告美国侵略者：既然日本法西斯强盗已经被我们伟大的中国人民所打垮，那么，美国侵略者在更加强大的并且有全世界人民支援的中朝人民面前，将会受到最严厉的制裁和惩罚！
