    Celebrating "March 8th" International Women's Day
    Beijing Screens Films such as "Zhao Yiman"
    In order to celebrate "March 8th" International Women's Day, Beijing's cinemas have specially selected to screen the domestically produced films "Zhao Yiman," "Liu Hulan," and the Soviet films "Government Member" and "Daughter of the Motherland" [“丹娘”, likely a transliteration of "Tanya"]. These films reflect various typical and glorious female heroic figures who emerged under the leadership of the Communist Party. The Chinese female Communist Party members Zhao Yiman and Liu Hulan, with their indomitable spirit, waged extremely arduous struggles during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. They loved their motherland and the people, and ultimately demonstrated unparalleled courage and determination in the face of cruel enemies, not hesitating to give their lives to pave the way for the people's liberation. "Daughter of the Motherland" [“丹娘”] is the story of Zoya, a heroic female guerrilla fighter in the Soviet Great Patriotic War, who sacrificed herself for her country. Her deeds have long been known to the people of the world. "Government Member" narrates the story of Sokolova, an ordinary rural woman in the Soviet Union, who suffered in the past but became an active member of a collective farm under the Soviet regime. In the struggle to win agricultural collectivization, she believed in the Party, believed in the Soviet regime, relied on the masses, and overcame one difficulty after another with a firm will, leading the collective farm to the road of victory. She was finally elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet. These films clearly point out the path for women to participate in the revolutionary struggle and provide a model of female heroism.

    庆祝“三八”国际妇女节
    北京上映“赵一曼”等影片
    为了庆祝“三八”国际妇女节，北京市各影院特选映国营片“赵一曼”、“刘胡兰”及苏联片“政府委员”和“丹娘”四部影片。这几部影片反映了在共产党领导下出现的各种典型的光荣的女英雄人物。中国的女共产党员赵一曼和刘胡兰，曾在抗日战争中以坚韧不拔的精神，进行了极其艰苦的斗争。她们热爱祖国与人民，到底在残酷敌人的面前表现了无比的英勇与坚决，不惜付出自己的生命，为人民解放事业铺平了道路。“丹娘”是苏联伟大卫国战争中英勇的女游击队员卓娅为国牺牲的故事。她的事迹，更早已为全世界的人民所熟知。“政府委员”叙述苏联的一个普通的农村妇女索告洛瓦，过去受苦、受压迫，但在苏维埃政权下成为集体农庄的一个积极分子。在争取农业集体化的斗争中，她相信党，相信苏维埃政权，依靠群众，以坚毅的意志克服了接二连三的困难，使集体农庄走上胜利的道路。她最后被推选为最高苏维埃代表。这些影片，很明显地指出了妇女参加革命斗争的道路，提供了妇女英雄的典范。
