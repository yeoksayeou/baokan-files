    Scholars and Swindlers
    Qiu Chi
    Among university professors, there are those who, cloaked in "Marxism-Leninism," peddle the poison of bourgeois ideology.
    What are their characteristics?
    They are changeable and adept at opportunism. They were originally "scholars" pursuing bourgeois fame and fortune, worshippers and followers of bourgeois doctrines, some even glorified fascism. When they were being trained and educated by the bourgeoisie, they were already learning the skills of "catering to customer psychology," creating prestigious brands, seeking out "niche markets," plagiarizing, and monopolizing the field. After leaving school, they flaunted their skills of self-promotion, sensationalism, selling whatever was in demand, and seizing opportunities to invest in the bourgeoisie. After liberation, they knew that their old tricks wouldn't work anymore, but they were unwilling to genuinely transform their thinking, change their stance, discard the old, and learn the new. What did they do? They transformed themselves, put on the cloak of "Marxism-Leninism," and continued to sell their ideological poison.
    They act like veterans, styling themselves as experts in Marxism-Leninism. They say: "I was talking about materialism more than twenty years ago!"
    "I was baptized in Marxism-Leninism during the May Fourth Movement." Or: "I participated in the 'revolution' early on, and I even have 'merit' for the revolution!" Or: "What do you know! I read Marxist-Leninist books early and often, and I talked about Marxism-Leninism in my lectures decades ago." "My guiding thought is Marxist-Leninist thought, but I'm not a Marxist-Leninist." "Only I can teach Marxist-Leninist economics (or pedagogy, philosophy, etc.)."
    They use Marxism-Leninism as their prestigious brand, searching for "revolutionary connections," "positive factors," "materialist components," and "old revolutionary friends" in their own ugly history... to deceive young students into trusting them.
    They wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism while peddling bourgeois poison. Although their lectures and speeches are filled with Marxist-Leninist terms, they actually divide Marxist-Leninist educational philosophy into two parts: "Lenin's educational philosophy" and "Stalin's educational philosophy," fabricate a completely different set of dialectics from dialectical materialism, and completely castrate the spiritual reaction of materialism to matter. When lecturing on psychology, they list the six schools of psychology, the first five of which are bourgeois schools of psychology, and the sixth is dialectical materialism psychology; they regard dialectical materialism psychology as a synthesis or addition of various schools of bourgeois thought, rather than criticizing bourgeois psychology with Marxist-Leninist psychology. When discussing educating students to adapt to students' personality and individuality, our "pedagogy experts" still divide personality into biological type, political type, intellectual type, etc., and assert that "the bourgeoisie are like this, and the proletariat and even future communist youth will have this type," spreading the bourgeoisie's stale and anti-scientific theories. One "scholar" who calls himself an "expert in children's education" said that "newborn infants have the ability to grasp on the first day of their birth"; not only that, "even unborn fetuses have a grasping function. One midwife, when examining a woman about to give birth, had her rubber gloves grabbed by the fetus." This is simply reciting bourgeois nonsense. Another "literary figure" said, when lecturing on "Chinese Literary History," that before socialist society, there was a "pre-capitalist society," and under this so-called "pre-capitalist society" he put a bracket and wrote "New Democratic Society." This is how they distort the New Democracy.
    They are arrogant and think highly of themselves. Because: since they consider themselves to be "old Marxists," of course they have to put on airs and act important. "What do you know about Marxism-Leninism? Can you criticize me?" "Students are not as good as teaching assistants, teaching assistants are not as good as lecturers, lecturers are not as good as professors, professors are not as good as deans, and deans are not as good as me." He is already "the sixth best in the world!" He doesn't put anyone in his eyes. He points fingers at others, afraid of not criticizing enough; for himself, he is arrogant and self-satisfied, perfect, and untouchable.
    The "Three-Anti" Movement has come, and these so-called "scholars" who wear beautiful cloaks and peddle the poison of bourgeois thought have revealed their true colors. The masses have seen clearly that they are not real "scholars," but complete cultural merchants and academic swindlers.
    Now it is the people's China, and the old tricks of deception and opportunism no longer work! The only path before these people is to honestly transform themselves. If they do not thoroughly examine themselves, then the masses do not understand "sophistication," and the masses will help you tear off your beautiful cloaks so that everyone and yourselves can see your deceptive essence.

    学者和骗子
    秋赤
    在高等学校的教授中，有这样一种人，他们披着“马列主义”的外衣，贩卖着资产阶级思想的毒品。
    他们的特点是什么呢？
    他们善变，善于投机取巧。他们本来是追求资产阶级名位和生活的“学者”，是资产阶级学说的崇拜者、奉行者，有的甚至曾是法西斯主义的歌颂者。当他们在受资产阶级的训练和教育的时候，他们就已经在那里学习“迎合顾客心理”，搞金字商标，钻“冷门”，东抄西袭，独霸一家等等的本领。走出学校之后，便大施其自吹自擂、哗众取宠、要什么卖什么、投资产阶级之机的伎俩。解放后，他们知道以前那一套货色是卖不出去了，但自己又不愿真心改造思想，改变立场，丢掉旧的，学习新的；怎么办呢？于是摇身一变，穿上“马列主义”的外衣，继续出卖他们的思想毒品。
    他们摆老资格，自命为马克思列宁主义专家。他们说：“我在二十多年以前就是讲唯物主义的啊！”
    “在五四运动时期就已经受了马列主义的洗礼。”或者说：“我早年就参加过‘革命’，我对革命还有‘功绩’呢！”或者说：“你们懂得什么！马列主义的书，我是读得早又读得多，几十年前的讲义里就讲过马列主义了。”“我的主导思想就是马列主义的思想，不过我不是马列主义者罢了。”“马列主义的经济学（或教育学、哲学等）只有我才能教。”
    他们拿着马克思列宁主义做他们的金字招牌，在自己的丑恶的历史里去寻找“革命因缘”、“积极因素”、“唯物主义成分”、“革命老朋友”……来骗取青年学生对他的信任。
    他们披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，贩卖资产阶级的毒品。他们在讲台上，在讲演稿里，虽然充满了马克思列宁主义的名词，然而实际上，却把马克思列宁主义的教育哲学分割为“列宁的教育哲学”和“斯大林的教育哲学”两个部分了，把辩证唯物论的辩证法杜撰成另外一套了，把唯物主义的精神对物质的反作用完全阉割了。讲心理学是列举心理学的六派，前五派都是资产阶级的心理学派，第六派才是辩证唯物论的心理学；把辩证唯物论的心理学看作是资产阶级的各派学说的综合或相加，而不是以马克思列宁主义的心理学来批判资产阶级的心理学。当谈到教育学生要适应学生的个性和人格时，我们的“教育学专家”仍然是把人格分为生物型、政治型、理智型等等，并且断言“资产阶级如此，无产阶级乃至将来的共产主义青年均会有此类型”，散布资产阶级陈腐的反科学的理论。一位自命为“儿童教育专家”的“学者”说“新生婴儿生下来的第一天就有把握能力”；不仅如此，“就是未出世的胎儿也有把握作用。有一位助产士在检查一位临产妇时，助产士的皮手套被胎儿抓住了”。这简直是在述说资产阶级的鬼话。另外一位“文学家”在讲“中国文学史”时，说什么在社会主义社会之前，有一个“前期资本主义社会”，在这个所谓“前期资本主义社会”的底下划了一个括号，写着“新民主主义社会”。他们就是这样来歪曲新民主主义的。
    他们自高自大，目空一切。因为：既然自以为是“老马克思主义者”，当然不能不把架子摆大一些，摆高一些。“你们懂得什么马列主义？你们能批评我么？”“学生不如助教，助教不如讲师，讲师不如教授，教授不如教务长，教务长还不如我。”他已经是“老子天下第六了”！谁也没有放在他眼睛里。对于别人，是指手划脚，唯恐指摘不周；对于自己，则是夜郎自大，十全十美，谁都动他不得。
    “三反”运动来了，这些披着美丽的外衣、贩卖着资产阶级思想毒品的所谓“学者”之流，原形毕露了。群众看清了，他们原来并不是什么真正的“学者”，却是十足的文化商人，是学术界的骗子。
    现在已经是人民的中国了，旧有的那一套招摇撞骗、投机取巧的种种手法，已经是行不通了！摆在这些人面前的，只有一条老老实实改造自己的路。如果还不彻底检讨自己，那么，群众是不懂得“世故”的，群众就会来帮助你们扯下那美丽的外衣，让大家和你们自己来看看你们骗人的本质。
