    Trying out the Soviet "Train Towing Method"
    Liu Jianxing Creates New National Towing Record
    Liu Jianxing, stationmaster of the Wuhu office dispatch station of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, has created a new national record of 7.7 tons per horsepower in towing navigation by trying out the Soviet "train towing method," breaking the national record of 7 tons per horsepower set by the Nanjing Navigation Bureau last year.
    In the past, the ship formations for inland river towing in our country have always adopted the Anglo-American "parallel method," that is, the barges and tugboats move forward side by side, or the barges are arranged side by side and follow the tugboat. In this way, the ships suffer a great deal of water resistance. The "train towing method" prevalent in the Soviet Union arranges the barges end to end in a single row, hanging behind the tugboat, to reduce water resistance and improve towing efficiency. Liu Jianxing tried the "train towing method" in January of this year. He used the 300-horsepower "Guohai" vessel to tow four barges with a total load of 2,300 tons between Wuhu and Shanghai, and the round trip went smoothly.
    When Liu Jianxing tried the "train towing method," he hung the large barges in the front and the small barges in the back, and tried to shorten the distance between the barges to reduce water resistance and overcome the difficulty of inflexible maneuvering. At the same time, when traveling upstream, he tried to use still water as much as possible, and hugged the beach and walked through the gorges during high tide. The results of this experiment proved that the water resistance suffered by the ship was reduced by about one-fifth compared with the "parallel method." Before liberation, the "Guohai" vessel only towed 500 tons, and after liberation, it towed a maximum of 1,500 tons. After trying the "train towing method," it towed 2,300 tons. Calculated at the lowest freight price of 50,000 yuan per ton, the "Guohai" vessel can save the state at least 40 million yuan in freight for a single trip from Wuhu to Shanghai.
    Now the Wuhu office of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration is gradually promoting the "train towing method." (Xinhua News Agency)

### 试用苏联“一列拖带法”  刘健行创造拖运航行的全国新纪录

    试用苏联“一列拖带法”
    刘健行创造拖运航行的全国新纪录
    长江航务管理局芜湖办事处调度站站长刘健行试用苏联“一列拖带法”，创造了拖运航行平均每匹马力七点七吨的全国新纪录，打破了去年南京航务局平均每匹马力拖运七吨的全国纪录。
    过去我国内河拖运航行的船只编队一向是采用英美式的“并列法”，就是使驳船和拖轮齐头并进，或使驳船并列尾随拖轮前进，这样船只遭受的水的阻力很大。在苏联盛行的“一列拖带法”是把驳船头尾依次衔接排成一个单列，挂在拖轮后面，以减少水的阻力，提高拖运效率。刘健行在今年一月间试行“一列拖带法”。用三百匹马力的“国海”轮拖带载重共二千三百吨的四只驳船，航行芜湖上海间，结果往返航行都很顺利。
    刘健行试用“一列拖带法”时，把大驳船挂在前面，小驳船挂在后面，并且尽量缩短驳船和驳船间的距离，以减少水流阻力和克服操纵不灵的困难；同时在上水行驶时尽量利用静水，在涨潮时抱滩走峡。这样试验的结果证明：船只遭受水的阻力比“并列法”减少大约五分之一。“国海”轮解放前只拖五百吨，解放后最高拖过一千五百吨，试行“一列拖带法”后便拖到二千三百吨。以最低货运价格每吨五万元计算，“国海”轮从芜湖到上海单程一次，至少就能为国家节省四千万元的运费。
    现在长江航务管理局芜湖办事处正在逐步推广“一列拖带法”。（新华社）
