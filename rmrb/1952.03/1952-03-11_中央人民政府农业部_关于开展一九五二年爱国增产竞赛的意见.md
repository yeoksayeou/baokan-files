    Opinions of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on Launching the 1952 Patriotic Production Increase Competition

    I. The patriotic bumper harvest competition initiated by the Li Shunda mutual aid team in 1951 was enthusiastically responded to by over one million mutual aid teams and many individual farmers nationwide. The output of farmers who actively participated in the competition significantly increased. The experience of the past year has proven that the patriotic production increase competition is a form that farmers are happy to accept and a good way to guide the broad masses of farmers to combine their patriotic enthusiasm with their enthusiasm for increasing production, and to strive to improve yield per unit area. In 1952, in order to respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "increase production and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," the patriotic production increase competition should be launched more widely and deeply.

    II. The initiation of the competition should focus on mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives and also absorb individual farmers. State-owned farms should also launch competitions and can compete with farmers.

    The forms of competition should be diverse in order to attract the active participation of the broad masses. In order to promote the widespread increase in yields among farmers, a comprehensive production increase competition including a variety of crops should be organized first. Furthermore, in order to promote a substantial increase in the yields of several major crops and break through the production limitations of farmers, a single-item production increase competition for a certain crop should also be organized. This year, rice, wheat, and cotton are tentatively proposed for competition. Various regions can also organize other forms of competition according to their needs.

    The conditions of the competition should focus on the general increase in yield per unit area, and the content must be simple, specific, and easy to compare. The conditions for the above-mentioned comprehensive production increase competition mainly include the average yield per mu of various crops calculated together, as well as the amount and proportion of the increase in production; secondly, the high yield of a certain crop. The conditions for the above-mentioned three major crop competitions should include: the average yield per mu of each crop, the amount and proportion of increase in production compared to last year, and the highest bumper harvest target. The area for high-yield output should not be too small. Generally speaking, individuals should not be less than one mu, mutual aid teams or production cooperatives should not be less than three mu, and state-owned farms should be more than ten mu. After the challenge is initiated, farmers and state-owned farms can freely choose any of the above items to participate in the competition.

    In order to initiate the competition in a planned and guided manner, it is planned to organize nationally renowned bumper harvest mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives to jointly propose various challenges. For example, Li Shunda, Han En, Li Tianying, Pu Zhongzhi, Su Dianxuan, and others will initiate a comprehensive production increase challenge; Chen Yongkang, Li Chenggui, and Liu Changwen will jointly propose a challenge of 1,500 jin of rice per mu; Qu Yaoli, Wu Xuanwen, and Zhang Defang will jointly launch a challenge of 1,000 jin of cotton per mu; Shi Anfu will launch a wheat production increase challenge, and so on. Then, various regions can organize responses to the challenges, and at the same time, those who respond to the challenges will issue challenges to local farmers, so as to universally launch a patriotic production increase competition movement in the form of a chain competition.

    III. Strengthening the leadership of the patriotic production increase competition movement, first of all, is to strengthen patriotic education, so that farmers' production is closely integrated with political struggle, and vigorously promote the production increase competition. All regions must fully mobilize the masses, conduct detailed discussions, formulate active and achievable production increase plans, and specific measures to complete the plans. And carry out some production and construction work. All regions should make sufficient estimates and full material preparations for all possible difficulties, especially droughts, insect plagues, and floods, and tenaciously fight against various disasters, and strive to complete the plan and achieve a bumper harvest even in the event of disasters.

    Secondly, earnestly promoting advanced bumper harvest experience is an important way to complete the competition plan. All regions can organize farmers participating in the competition to carefully study the experiences of Qu Yaoli, Shi Anfu, Chen Yongkang, Li Chenggui, and others in obtaining bumper harvests, overcome conservative ideas, and improve farming techniques in order to strive to increase yields.

    Thirdly, conduct timely inspections and summaries to prevent the tendency of formalism. After the competition is launched, all regions should conduct in-depth inspections based on the production season, and carry out mass appraisal movements, summarize experience and guide work at any time. Before the harvest, all regions should conduct bumper harvest registration, verify yields, and conduct serious awards after the autumn harvest.

    中央人民政府农业部
    关于开展一九五二年爱国增产竞赛的意见
    一、一九五一年由李顺达互助组发起的爱国丰产竞赛，曾获得全国范围内一百多万互助组和许多个体农民的热烈响应，凡是积极参加竞赛的农民的产量都得到了显著的提高。一年来的经验证明了爱国丰产竞赛是农民乐于接受的形式，也是领导广大农民把爱国热情与增产积极性结合起来，努力提高单位面积产量的一种很好的方法。一九五二年为了响应毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召，应该把爱国增产竞赛更广泛更深入地开展起来。
    二、竞赛的发动，应以互助组或农业生产合作社为主，并吸收个体农民参加，国营农场也应开展竞赛，并可与农民竞赛。
    竞赛的形式应该多种多样，才能吸收广大群众积极参加。为了推动广大农民普遍提高产量，首先应组织包括多种农作物在一起的全面增产竞赛；又为了促进几种主要农作物大大提高产量，并突破农民的生产局限性，还应组织某一种农作物的单项增产竞赛，今年暂提出水稻、小麦和棉花三种作物进行竞赛。各地还可按照需要组织其他形式的竞赛。
    竞赛的条件应集中在普遍提高单位面积产量上，内容须简明、具体，易于比较。上述全面增产竞赛的条件，主要是把多种作物计算在一起的每亩平均产量，以及增产数量和比例；其次是某种作物的高额产量。上述三种主要农作物竞赛的条件，应包括：各该项作物每亩平均的产量，比去年增产的数量与比例，以及最高的丰产目标。而高额产量的面积不可太少，一般说个人不得少于一市亩，互助组或生产合作社不得少于三市亩，国营农场应在十市亩以上。挑战发起后，农民与国营农场可自由选择上述条件中的任何项目参加竞赛。
    为了有计划有领导地发起竞赛，拟组织全国著名的丰产互助组和农业生产合作社联名提出各种挑战。如由李顺达、韩恩、李田英、蒲忠智、苏殿选等发起全面增产挑战；由陈永康、李承桂和刘长文等联名提出水稻每亩一千五百斤的挑战；由曲耀离、吴宣文和张德芳等联名发起棉花每亩千斤的挑战；由史安福发起小麦增产挑战等。然后各地可组织应战；并同时由应战者向当地农民提出挑战，以这样连环竞赛的形式，普遍展开爱国增产竞赛运动。
    三、加强对爱国增产竞赛运动的领导，首先是加强爱国主义教育，使农民的生产与政治斗争密切结合，有力地推动增产竞赛。各地要充分发动群众，经过详细讨论，订出积极的，而又可能做到的增产计划，和完成计划的具体办法。并进行一些生产建设工作。对可能遇到的一切困难，特别是旱灾、虫灾、水灾等，各地应作出足够的估计和充分的物质准备，顽强地与各种灾害作斗争，争取在发生灾害的情况下也能完成计划，获得丰收。
    其次，认真推广先进的丰产经验是完成竞赛计划的重要办法，各地可组织参加竞赛的农民仔细地研究曲耀离、史安福、陈永康、李承桂等获得丰产的经验，克服保守思想，改进耕作技术，以争取提高产量。
    第三，及时进行检查总结，防止形式主义的偏向。竞赛发动后，各地应根据生产季节深入检查，并开展群众性的评比运动，随时总结经验指导工作。收获前各地要进行丰产登记，查实产量，秋收完毕认真评奖。
