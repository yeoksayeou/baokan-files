Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    Chongqing, March 20th—According to a Xinhua News Agency report: Chongqing held a mass meeting on the 17th to announce the different treatments for a group of illegal industrial and commercial households. Over 10,000 employees and industrial and commercial figures from factories and shops across the city participated in the conference. A broad audience of citizens also gathered to listen to the live broadcast of the conference.

    Luo Shigao, Deputy Mayor of Chongqing, first reported at the conference on the achievements made in Chongqing's movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and the stealing of national economic intelligence. He explained that the movement had greatly deepened and advanced a step further in all aspects. He said that as of the 10th of this month, statistics showed that the industrial and commercial sector in the city had confessed and reported more than 217,000 items. More than 33,000 industrial and commercial households had been reported and confessed to illegal activities, with losses to state assets amounting to over 900 billion yuan. The movement over the past two months had exposed the organized and rampant offensive crimes of the bourgeoisie, and the broad masses of people had received a profound education.

    A group of industrial and commercial households were announced to be treated leniently at the conference because they made relatively sincere confessions. Zhang Zhenghua, the owner of Yingmei Pharmacy, stole 1.34 billion yuan of state assets, but he was able to take the initiative to confess his illegal activities and report eleven other illegal households in the same industry. The owner of Tongxing Flower Shop also had a large amount of bribery and tax evasion, but he confessed thoroughly and reported 41 illegal households. They were both announced to be exempt from criminal punishment. In addition, 26 illegal industrial and commercial households had been arrested by the Municipal People's Government upon the request of the masses due to the seriousness of their circumstances. However, during the trial process in the People's Court, they were able to thoroughly confess their crimes and expressed their willingness to perform meritorious service to redeem their crimes. Song Xuewu, the President of the Municipal People's Court, announced on the spot that they would be released on bail.

    The masses at the meeting also accused and reported a group of major thieves who had extremely serious circumstances, still refused to confess, and attempted to resist to the end, such as Li Zhisheng, the capitalist of Dahua Pharmaceutical Factory, who secretly harmed the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet; Xiong Junxiang, the owner of Minbang Lumber Factory, who led the industry in collective tax evasion; and Jiang Xuncheng, the manager of Xielian Coal Company, who stole economic intelligence and created a coal shortage. These profiteers have shown no signs of repentance since the launch of the movement, and continue to spread rumors to undermine the movement and form a "pact of mutual defense." Deputy Mayor Luo Shigao immediately announced that these profiteers, who were serious in their circumstances, had a bad attitude, and were hated by the people, would be severely punished, and they were arrested on the spot.

    Mayor Cao Diqiu pointed out at the meeting that Chongqing is comprehensively dealing with illegal industrial and commercial households based on the principle of combining seriousness and leniency, and combining transformation and punishment. He called on the general industrial and commercial households to completely dispel their worries, operate their businesses with peace of mind, and at the same time actively fight against the stubborn major profiteers.

    重庆从宽处理一批坦白彻底的违法工商户
    逮捕一批情节严重并订立“攻守同盟”企图顽抗的大奸商
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：重庆市在十七日举行群众大会，宣布对一批违法工商业户的不同处理。全市各工厂商店的职工和工商业者有一万多人参加了大会，广大市民群众也分别聚集收听大会的实况广播。
    重庆市人民政府副市长罗士高首先在大会上报告了重庆市反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动开始以来所获得的成绩，说明运动已经在各方面大大深入和推进了一步。他说截至本月十日的统计，全市工商界坦白检举的材料已达二十一万七千多件，被检举和自动坦白有违法行为的工商业户达三万三千多家，国家资财所受的损失达九千多亿元。两个多月来的运动揭露了资产阶级有组织的猖狂进攻的罪恶，使广大人民群众受到了深刻的教育。
    有一批工商业户因为作了较诚恳的坦白交代，在大会上被宣布从宽处理。英美药房老板张正华盗窃国家资财达十三亿四千万元，但他能主动交代违法行为，并检举了同业中的十一家违法户；同兴花行老板行贿和漏税数目也很大，但坦白彻底，并检举了四十一家违法户。他们都被宣布免予刑事处分。另有二十六名违法工商业户曾因情节严重，由市人民政府接受群众要求先后逮捕，但在人民法院审讯过程中，他们能彻底坦白自己的罪恶，表示愿意立功赎罪，当场由市人民法院院长宋学武宣布取保释放。
    到会群众又当场控诉和检举了一批情节极严重，至今尚拒不坦白，企图顽抗到底的大盗窃犯，如暗害人民解放军入藏部队的大华制药房资方李之生，领导同业集体逃税的民帮木材厂老板熊骏祥，盗窃经济情报，制造煤荒的协联炭号经理蒋勋成。这批奸商从运动开展至今毫无悔改表现，并且继续造谣破坏运动，订立“攻守同盟”。副市长罗士高当即宣布从严惩办这批情节严重，态度恶劣，民愤很大的奸商，当场予以逮捕。
    市长曹荻秋在会上指出：根据严肃与宽大相结合、改造与惩治相结合的方针，重庆市正在全面处理违法工商业户。他号召一般工商业户彻底解除顾虑，安心营业，同时积极向顽抗的大奸商作斗争。
