    CCP Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Xinxiang Regional Committee
    Self-Criticism Regarding Failure to Fully Launch the Anti-Corruption Campaign

    Editor: On February 1st, the People's Daily published reader Zhong Jingting's criticism of the Xinxiang region railway system for not yet fully launching the anti-corruption struggle. After our examination, we believe this criticism is correct.

    We did not sufficiently recognize the importance of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. For a long time after the campaign began, we were still engaged in democratic unity work, believing that this would lay the foundation for the anti-corruption movement. Therefore, our steps were inconsistent with those of the CCP Xinxiang Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government. After the Municipal Committee raised its concerns with us, we immediately requested instructions from higher authorities, but because we failed to actively offer our opinions, the anti-corruption campaign did not immediately unfold.

    According to instructions from higher authorities, we convened a cadre meeting on January 21st and launched the anti-corruption campaign on the 27th. Now, we have achieved initial results and are concentrating all our efforts, with the leaders personally directing, to mobilize the masses to encircle and suppress the big "tigers" from all directions.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中共郑州铁路局新乡地区委员会
    对没有全面开展反贪污运动的检讨
    编辑同志：二月一日，人民日报发表读者仲敬庭对新乡地区铁路系统尚未全面开展反贪污斗争的批评，经我们检查，认为这个批评是对的。
    我们对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的重要性是认识不足的。我们在运动开始很长时间之后，还在搞民主团结工作，以为这能给反贪污运动打下基础。因此，我们和中共新乡市委和市政府的步骤不一致。市委向我们提出意见以后，我们即向上级请示，但因不能积极提出意见，致反贪污运动没有立即展开。
    根据上级指示，我们在一月二十一日召开了干部会议，在二十七日展开了反贪污运动。现在，我们已有了初步成绩，正集中全力，由首长亲自指挥，发动群众从四面八方来围剿大“老虎”。
