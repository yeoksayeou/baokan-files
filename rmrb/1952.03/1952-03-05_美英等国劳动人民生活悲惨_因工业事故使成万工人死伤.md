Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 4th: The "Labor Daily" published an editorial commenting on the working conditions in capitalist countries.

The "Labor Daily" mentioned the recent coal mine explosion in West Frankfort, Illinois, USA, in which 119 workers died. American bourgeois newspapers have tried to portray this tragedy as an accidental event. However, the "Labor Daily" pointed out that the many workers who die unnaturally in industry and the many workers who are crippled should all be held responsible by the capitalists who have greed and an insatiable desire to pursue exorbitant profits.

The "Labor Daily" pointed out that in the past eighty years, more than 80% of American miners have suffered serious and minor injuries. In the industrial accidents that occurred in 1950, 15,500 workers died unnaturally in the United States, and about 2 million workers were seriously injured. The number of workers who died in industrial accidents in the United States in 1950 was twice the number of American soldiers killed in action in the first year after the United States entered World War II. As for the number of injured workers, it was twice the personnel losses suffered by the American Army during the entire war (including those captured and missing).

Due to the shift of the American economy to war, the exploitation of the working people has become even more severe. In order to pursue war profits, capitalists have intensified the speed-up system in industry to the extreme. At the same time, there are virtually no measures to protect labor and ensure safety.

The "Labor Daily" said that throughout the capitalist world—in France and Italy, in West Germany and Japan—millions of working people also die unnaturally or become disabled under the capitalist system. For example, in France, a total of 1.7 million accidents occurred in industry in 1951, of which 2,800 caused deaths. In Italy, an average of 38 serious worker injury incidents occurred every day in 1950!

The "Labor Daily" said that under the general crisis of capitalism, the long-term unemployment of a large number of workers makes it possible for employers to increase the intensity of labor to an extremely appalling degree. Due to the greatly intensified work intensity, monopoly capitalists can obtain huge profits without spending a penny on adding new industrial equipment. On the other hand, it makes workers prematurely disabled, making them live a miserable life, and making them die. The wages that workers receive cannot compensate for the large amount of vitality they have lost. The vise of exploitation is getting tighter and tighter. Monopoly capitalists are desperately extending the working day and reducing workers' wages. The law of eight hours of work per day, which the working class in the United States, Britain, and other imperialist countries has fought for for many years, is being violated more and more frequently. At the same time, real wages are decreasing year by year. For example, in the United States, more than 70% of workers earn wages below the officially published minimum cost of living. The prices of food and manufactured consumer goods are constantly rising. In 1951, prices in the United States rose by 22%, and prices in the United Kingdom rose by 25%. Capitalists intend to place the entire burden of expanding armaments and preparing for wars of aggression on the shoulders of the working people. War mongers are extorting huge sums of money from taxpayers—the people of the United States and countries affiliated with the United States. For example, in the United Kingdom, heavy taxes swallow up more than half of workers' wages.

The "Labor Daily" concluded that the capitalist system is a system that makes labor a disaster, a heavy burden, and a shackle for the working people.

    美英等国劳动人民生活悲惨
    因工业事故使成万工人死伤
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：“劳动报”发表社论，评论资本主义国家的劳动条件。
    “劳动报”提到不久以前美国伊利诺斯州西法兰克福市附近的煤矿爆炸惨案，那次惨案中死了一百一十九个工人。美国资产阶级报纸竭力把这个惨案说成是一个偶发事件。可是，“劳动报”指出：工业中许多工人死于非命，许多工人成了残废，都应该由有着贪欲和追逐暴利的无餍的欲望的资本家负责。
    “劳动报”指出：在过去八十年中，美国的采矿工人百分之八十以上都受过重伤和轻伤。在一九五○年所发生的工业惨案中，美国有一万五千五百个工人死于非命，约二百万工人受了重伤。一九五○年美国工业惨案中死亡工人的人数，相当于美国在参加第二次世界大战以后第一年阵亡士兵人数的两倍。至于受伤工人的人数，相当于美国陆军在整个战争期间所遭受的人员损失（包括被俘与失踪者在内）的两倍。
    由于美国经济的转向战争，劳动人民所受的剥削已越发加重。资本家为了追逐战争利润，就把工业中的赶快制度加强到了极点。同时，实际上根本没有保护劳工和保障安全的措施。
    “劳动报”说：在资本主义世界的各处——在法国和意大利、在西德和日本——也有千百万的劳动人民在资本主义制度之下死于非命或变成残废。例如在法国，一九五一年在工业中共发生一百七十万次事故，其中有两千八百次事故造成了死亡。意大利工人受重伤的事件，在一九五○年每天平均竟有三十八次！
    “劳动报”说：在资本主义的总危机下，大批工人的长期失业，使得雇主们有可能将劳动的强度提高到极其骇人的程度。由于工作强度大大加强，垄断资本家可以不花分文添设新的工业设备而获得庞大的利润，另一方面，却使工人早成残废，使他们度着苟延残喘的悲惨生活，使他们死亡。工人们所得的工资，不能补偿他们大量丧失了的生命力。剥削的巨钳越来越紧，垄断资本家拚命地延长工作日，减少工人的工资。美国、英国和其他帝国主义国家的工人阶级经过多年的斗争才争取到的每日工作八小时的法律，正在越来越频繁地被破坏着。同时，实际工资一年年地降低。例如在美国，百分之七十以上的工人所获得的工资是在官方所发表的最低生活费用水平之下。食品和制成消费品的价格正在不断上涨。一九五一年美国物价上涨百分之二十二，英国物价上涨百分之二十五。资本家打算把扩张军备和准备侵略战争的全部负担都放在劳动人民的肩头。战争贩子们正在向纳税人——美国和附属于美国的各国的人民——榨取巨额的金钱。例如在英国，重税竟然吞没了工人工资的一半以上。
    “劳动报”最后说：资本主义制度就是使劳动成为劳动人民的灾殃、沉重的负担和枷锁的制度。
