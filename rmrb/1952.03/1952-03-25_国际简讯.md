The Myoma branch of the Burma-China Friendship Association was established on December 5th of last year, and U Htin Baw, Chairman of the Burma-China Friendship Association, personally went from Rangoon to preside over the establishment ceremony. The Kyaukme branch was also established on December 28th. The Wakema branch and the Nabuta branch were successively established on February 2nd and 6th. The General Association of the Burma-China Friendship Association sent the Vice-Chairman of the Association, Tekin Lay Maung, and Daw Khin Khin Lay, Chairman of the Burmese Women's Liberation Association, who came to our country last year to attend the National Day celebrations, to participate. Burmese people in Shwebo and Bago have also begun to actively prepare for the establishment of branches of the Burma-China Friendship Association.
    American reactionaries persecute progressive professors
    Professor Struik, a famous mathematics professor who is to be tried for teaching Marxist theory, accused the American reactionaries of attempting to stifle American scientific thought through the persecution of Marxists. Speaking at a rally attended by 600 people, Struik pointed out that the principles of Marxism guide the activities of one-third of mankind, and said that a knowledge of Marxism is important for understanding the world. Struik said that now is the time for friends of civil rights to protest against political persecutions like the Foley Square trial and against the academic community's reversal of the truth.
    Struik himself is a victim of political persecution in the academic community and has been temporarily removed from his professorship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology pending trial. He is accused of "conspiring to overthrow the government of Massachusetts and the government of the United States." In addition to being an outstanding mathematician, Struik is also known to the world as an active mass leader, lecturer, and chairman of the Massachusetts Committee for American-Soviet Friendship.
