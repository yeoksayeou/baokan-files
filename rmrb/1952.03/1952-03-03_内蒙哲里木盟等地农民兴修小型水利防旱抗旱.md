Farmers in some banners and counties in the Jerim League, Hinggan League, and Chahar League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are building small-scale farmland water conservancy projects to create favorable conditions for bumper harvests in agriculture and animal husbandry this year. According to statistics at the end of January this year, a total of 31 canals and 1,162 wells have been opened in various banners and counties of the Jerim League. Kailu County in this league repaired two irrigation projects and one sluice gate in Xinan Village and Kechangbao Village last year, which can irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land this spring. In order to actively prevent drought, farmers in Zhalute Banner and Naiman Banner have formulated specific construction plans. Zhalute Banner plans to open 22 rivers and canals on the basis of the original water conservancy facilities, and dig 58 wells in pastoral areas; Naiman Banner plans to dig 2,244 wells and open 5 canals. Farmers in various Nutuks in the Horqin Right Wing Front Banner of the Hinggan League have also begun preparations for farming and drought prevention. Five Gacha (villages) in this area that are located near rivers have already built twelve dams and dug forty-seven wells. In order to ensure that 12,500 mu of land are not threatened by drought, Huade County in the Chahar League plans to dig 250 wells. (Summary)
