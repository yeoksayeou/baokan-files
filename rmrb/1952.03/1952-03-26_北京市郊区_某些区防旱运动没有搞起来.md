    Beijing Suburban Districts
    Anti-Drought Movement Has Not Taken Off in Some Suburban Districts of Beijing
    Since the establishment of the Beijing Suburban Production and Drought Prevention Office, most districts have organized cadres to go to the countryside to promote drought prevention work. For example, in the Tenth District, 25 villages have established drought prevention production committees, and in the Sixteenth District, 15 villages have done so. The majority of villagers have taken action. For example, in the Fourteenth District, more than 8,500 mu of land in eight villages, including Taiyanggong, have been pressed. Farmers in many villages are looking for water sources, clearing canals, and establishing canal management systems.
    However, some districts have devoted very little effort to this work. The Fifteenth District has only four cadres engaged in this work, and the Thirteenth District has only six cadres. This has affected the smooth progress of drought prevention work. Only five villages in the Thirteenth District have established production and drought prevention committees, and the majority of the masses have not yet been mobilized. Drought prevention work in most villages is still in a state of laissez-faire.
    Several districts also have a shortage of fertilizer preparation. Some people hold the attitude of "having as much as we have" and do not actively try to accumulate fertilizer.
    The phenomena of some districts' lack of active leadership in the drought prevention movement and neglect of fertilizer accumulation should be corrected immediately.

### 北京市郊区  某些区防旱运动没有搞起来

    北京市郊区
    某些区防旱运动没有搞起来
    北京市郊区生产防旱办公室成立以后，多数区都已组织干部下乡，推动防旱工作。如十区已有二十五个村、十六区已有十五个村，相继成立了防旱生产委员会。多数村庄的农民已经行动起来。如十四区太阳宫等八个村已压地八千五百多亩。许多村庄的农民正在寻找水源、清理渠道和订定渠道管理制度。
    但是，有的区在这一工作上用的力量却很小。十五区只有四个干部进行这一工作，十三区也只有六个干部进行这一工作。这样就影响了防旱工作的顺利开展。十三区只有五个村成立了生产防旱委员会，大部分群众还没有动起来。多数村庄的防旱工作还处于自流状态。
    有几个区还存在着肥料准备不足的现象，有些群众抱着“有多少，算多少”的态度，不积极设法积肥。
    某些区这种不积极领导防旱运动和忽视积肥的现象，是应该立即纠正的。
