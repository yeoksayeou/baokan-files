Medical Workers from Various Places Write, Requesting to Go to the Front Lines to Extinguish the Poisonous Flames of the US Aggressors' Germ Warfare

Editor: We protest with unparalleled anger against the germ warfare launched by the American bandits!

The purpose of medical research on bacteria is to eliminate human diseases and reduce human suffering, but the American imperialists use it as a tool to spread diseases and harm humanity. This fully demonstrates the cruelty of the American imperialists, far exceeding any reactionary group in history. This also shows that the so-called "scientists" in the United States are being shamefully exploited by the American ruling group. Faced with such a bloody reality, our task is very clear. We are medical workers of New China, white-clad warriors in the peace camp, and we are irreconcilable with the American imperialists and the scientific thieves they keep.

Now we are ready and have organized ourselves. We will fight to extinguish the germ warfare!

Editor: All employees of our Xi'an Railway Hospital held an accusation meeting in order to respond to the provocative behavior of American imperialism with practical actions. Comrade Guo Xifeng, a female epidemic prevention worker, said: "Although I have five children, I also want to go to Korea to participate in epidemic prevention work, extinguish the enemy's poisonous flames, and completely crush the enemy's ambitions." Nurse Cai Bingmin said: "My child is only three months old, and I am in good health. I can also talk to the Korean people in their language. I ask the higher authorities to approve my going." Sixty-four letters of determination requesting to serve in Korea were received on the spot. Hu Jin, the deputy director of the hospital, said: "We can take out a lot of medicines and equipment to extinguish bacteria and form an epidemic prevention inspection team, ready to depart at any time." In order to continue to support our most beloved people, in addition to ensuring the strengthening of epidemic prevention publicity and education, all personnel have also signed up to prepare to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, go to the glorious post, and extinguish the poisonous flames of the US aggressors' germ warfare.

Editor: The American aggressors are the enemy of world peace. Their crime of conducting germ warfare has aroused unanimous anger and condemnation from the Chinese and Korean people and the just condemnation of world public opinion. The American aggressors are following the old path of German and Japanese fascists. However, germ warfare cannot save them from failure. In order to support our most beloved people and to retaliate against the US aggressors' atrocities of spreading bacteria, 138 people in our hospital have signed up to volunteer to participate in anti-germ warfare work. We have decided to establish the "Shanxi University Medical College Volunteer Anti-Epidemic Inspection First Team to Korea," ready to depart and fight to completely crush the inhuman crimes of American imperialism.

Editor: At the symposium commemorating "March 8th" Women's Day, all the female comrades in our hospital expressed their greatest anger and hatred for the atrocities of American imperialism in spreading bacteria in Korea and Northeast China. We have decided to express our protest with the following practical actions:

1. We will organize ourselves to learn epidemic prevention knowledge, and suggest that the health authorities open epidemic prevention personnel training courses or invite experts to give reports on relevant epidemic prevention knowledge.

2. We will organize an epidemic prevention team and be prepared to leave for the front lines at any time to contribute all our strength to the motherland.

We will redouble our work efficiency to relieve the suffering of the people of Inner Mongolia from diseases caused by past feudal rule and Japanese fascist rule, and protect the people's health. We are determined to overcome all difficulties in our work, step up epidemic prevention and health work, and at the same time do a good job in supporting the anti-US aggression and aiding Korea front, and actively participate in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, so as to retaliate against this heinous crime of the American aggressors with practical actions.

    各地医务工作者纷纷来信
    要求上前线扑灭美国侵略者细菌战的毒焰
    编辑同志：我们以无比的愤怒，抗议美国强盗发动的细菌战！
    医学上研究细菌的目的，是为了消灭人类的疾病和减少人类的痛苦，但是美帝国主义者却拿它作为传播疾病和残害人类的工具。这充分说明了美帝国主义者的残酷，远超过历史上任何反动集团。这也说明了在美国所谓的“科学家”们是被美国统治集团可耻地利用着。面对着如此血腥的现实，我们的任务是十分明显的。我们是新中国的医务工作者，是和平阵营里的白衣战士，我们和美帝国主义者及他们所豢养的科学盗贼们是誓不两立的。
    现在我们已经准备好了，已经组织好了。我们要为扑灭细菌战而斗争！

    编辑同志：美国侵略者是世界和平的敌人，它进行细菌战的罪行已经引起了中朝人民的一致愤怒声讨以及全世界公正舆论的正义斥责。美国侵略者正在走着德、日法西斯的老路。但是，细菌战并不能挽救它的失败。为了支援我们最可爱的人，为了回击美国侵略者撒布细菌的暴行，我院已有一百三十八人报名志愿参加反细菌战工作。我们决定成立“山西大学医学院志愿赴朝防疫检验第一队”，待命出发，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义惨无人道的罪行而斗争。山西大学医学院教育工会
    编辑同志：在纪念“三八”节的座谈会上，我院全体女同志对美帝国主义在朝鲜和东北散布细菌的暴行都表示最大的愤怒和仇恨。我们决定用下列实际行动表示我们的抗议：

    二、我们要组织防疫队，准备随时出发到前线为祖国贡献我们的一切力量。
