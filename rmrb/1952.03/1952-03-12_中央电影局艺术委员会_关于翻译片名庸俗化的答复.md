Editor's Note: Our newspaper has received letters from readers criticizing the phenomenon of some translated film titles catering to the vulgar tastes of backward urban audiences. We forwarded the readers' opinions to the Art Committee of the Central Film Bureau and have received a reply. We are now publishing the reply below:

Comrade Editor: We recently received readers' opinions forwarded by the newspaper, criticizing the titles of certain translated films. After studying them, we believe these opinions are basically correct and need to be answered publicly.

The work of translating films by state-owned studios began in 1949. Before that, Soviet films were screened in various places, each film having more than one translated title. After we started translating films, we unified and reviewed the translated titles.

Our work of unifying and reviewing translated titles has not been done well. According to a preliminary check, many of the translated film titles reviewed by us in the past three years are inappropriate. For example, "True Man" was changed to "Legless Flying General";
"Miraculous Seeds" was changed to "Treasure Box Magic Flute" ("Seeds of Happiness" was also an old translated title); "The Peddler and the Lady" was changed to "Lovers Finally Get Married"; the original Russian title of "Thirteen Brave Men" translates directly as "Thirteen People," one of whom is a traitor. The old translation of "Thirteen Brave Men" is wrong, but changing it to "Desert Hardships" is also inappropriate. Because these translated titles cannot accurately reflect the content of the films, they cannot prominently express the propaganda effect of the film's main content. And changing the very appropriate and vivid original name such as "The Beautiful Vasilisa" to "Three-Headed Fierce Dragon" is even more inappropriate.

The reason for this situation is that the comrades responsible for reviewing translated films have a tendency in their thinking to cater to the backward tastes of urban petty-bourgeois audiences. They thought that some original names were not enough to attract the attention of the audience, and therefore mistakenly fabricated or used old names. Some of these vulgar and sensational translated titles were intended to attract some urban audiences who were used to watching bourgeois films before liberation. This is a vulgar bourgeois artistic ideology and style, and has nothing in common with today's people's film industry. We will strive to correct this error in our future work. We are willing to sincerely accept the criticisms raised by readers, especially Comrade Shan Fu, in the article "Introducing 'The Beautiful Vasilisa' and Criticizing the Incorrect Translated Title - 'Three-Headed Fierce Dragon'" in the Northeast Daily on January 5, except for a few places that slightly deviate from the facts.

In order to correct the error, we have decided to change the translated title of the film "Three-Headed Fierce Dragon" to "The Beautiful Vasilisa" and have notified the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation to inform its regional companies to change the name and distribute it.

### 中央电影局艺术委员会  关于翻译片名庸俗化的答复

    中央电影局艺术委员会
    关于翻译片名庸俗化的答复
    编者按：本报曾接到一些读者来信，批评某些翻译影片的名字有迎合城市落后观众的庸俗趣味的现象。我们把读者的意见转给中央电影局艺术委员会后，已得到答复。现在把复信发表于后：
    编辑同志：我们最近收到报社转来的读者意见，对某些翻译片译名提出批评。经研究后，我们认为这些意见基本上是正确的，有作公开答复的必要。
    国营厂翻译片的工作开始于一九四九年，在此以前，苏联影片已在各地上映，每片有一种以上的译名。我们开始翻译影片后，即统一审订译名。
    我们统一审订译名的工作作得很不好。据初步检查，三年来经我们审订的翻译片译名中，有不少种是不妥的。如把“真正的人”改为“无脚飞将军”；
    “奇异的种子”改为“宝盒仙笛”；（“幸福的种子”亦为旧译名）；“货郎与小姐”改为“有情人终成眷属”；“十三勇士”俄文原名直译为“十三个人”，十三个人中有一人是叛徒，旧译为“十三勇士”是错误的，但改为“沙漠苦战记”也并不恰当。由于这些译名不能很好地符合影片内容，所以就不能突出地表现影片主要内容的宣传效果。而把非常妥切生动的原名如“美丽的华喜丽莎”改为
    “三头凶龙”，则更是不妥当。
    造成这种情况的原因，是由于我们负责翻译片审订工作的同志，在思想上存在着一种迎合城市小市民观众的落后趣味的倾向。他们以为某些原名不足以吸引观众的注意，因而错误地加以编造或沿用旧名。其中有些庸俗的、耸人听闻的译名，是企图用以吸引解放前看惯了资产阶级电影的部分城市观众。这是一种庸俗的资产阶级的艺术思想作风，和今天的人民电影事业毫无共同之处。我们要在今后的工作中努力改正此种错误。读者们特别是单复同志在一月五日东北日报上“介绍‘美丽的华喜丽莎’并评不正确的译名——‘三头凶龙’”一文中所提出的批评，其中除个别地方与事实稍有出入外，我们愿意诚恳地接受。
    为了纠正错误，我们决定把“三头凶龙”一片译名改为“美丽的华喜丽莎”，并已通知中国影片经理公司转知所属各区公司即更名发行。
