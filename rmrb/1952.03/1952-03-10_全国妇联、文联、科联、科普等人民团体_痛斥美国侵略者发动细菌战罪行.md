    Denounce the Crime of Bacteriological Warfare Launched by the American Aggressors

    [This Newspaper News] The All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and other people's organizations unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement of March 8 and angrily protest against the bacteriological warfare waged by US imperialism.

    The All-China Democratic Women's Federation, representing women across the country, lodged a serious protest with the US government. The statement issued by the Women's Federation said: We cannot tolerate the US imperialists' insane slaughter of our people using bacteriological weapons that are absolutely prohibited by international law and human morality. Women across the country will continue to strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and strive to increase production and practice economy to counter the shameless attacks of the US imperialists. We call on women and people who love peace all over the world to unite and condemn the US government's atrocities of violating our country's airspace and slaughtering our people.

    The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, representing literary and art workers across the country, issued a statement saying: The US government's insane and brutal crime of conducting large-scale bacteriological warfare is intolerable to the people of our country and the people of all countries in the world. We demand that the people of our country and the people of the world who uphold justice and humanity severely punish this heinous crime of the US government. We call on all literary and art workers across the country to continue to step up their efforts to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and to unite with all literary and art workers who stand on the side of justice to rise up and use the powerful weapon of literature and art to condemn the US government's conspiracy and crimes, to smash the US imperialists' conspiracy to enslave the people of the world and prepare for a third world war, and to defend the lasting peace of Asia and the world.

    The All-China Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization jointly issued a statement on March 9, saying: As everyone knows, as early as 1925, US imperialism refused to ratify the Geneva Protocol against bacteriological warfare. The United States had preparations for bacteriological warfare before World War II. After the end of World War II, US imperialism supported a large number of Japanese bacteriological war criminals, such as Shiro Ishii and Jiro Wakamatsu, engaged in secret research, and built factories in its own country and Japan to produce large quantities of poisonous bacteria. Recently, they even used captured personnel from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers as cruelly inhumane bacteriological experimental subjects. Launching bacteriological warfare in Korea and dropping poisonous insects in Northeast China is a complete exposure of the long-term criminal conspiracy of the crazy and brutal US imperialists to harm the Chinese and Korean people and even all mankind! Our national scientific workers will never tolerate this inhumane and brutal crime of US imperialism. We fully support the solemn statements made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on February 24 and March 8. The more brutal and insane the US imperialists are, the more isolated and desperate they are, and the closer they are to destruction. Our national scientific workers, turning anger into strength, must mobilize and go to the forefront of the fight against US imperialist bacteriological warfare, using all our scientific knowledge, technology and strength to smash US imperialist bacteriological warfare and smash its
    all evil conspiracies to expand and prolong the war of aggression! Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, we will wage a resolute struggle against the heinous American aggressors, and we will never stop until we achieve complete victory! Victory must be ours! In order to protect the safety of our motherland and the Korean brothers and sisters and all mankind, in order to safeguard the peace of Asia and the world, human justice and scientific civilization, we call on all members of the World Federation of Scientific Workers and all scientists who love truth, justice and peace to immediately and effectively stop the heinous crimes of the American aggressors, and to impose the most severe sanctions on the major and minor war criminals who launched bacteriological warfare!

    The statement of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China said: Our textile workers will never tolerate the US imperialists' atrocities of expanding bacteriological warfare. We guarantee to protest against the atrocities of the US aggressors with practical actions to improve the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement, launch the movement to increase production and practice economy, and promote the Hao Jianxiu work method and the 1951 weaving work method to create more wealth for the motherland.

    The statement of the National Committee of the Educational Workers' Union of China said: We, the educational workers of the whole country, fully support the statement of Minister Zhou Enlai of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We will form a strong epidemic prevention front with the broad masses of the people, strengthen the strength of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and attack the US aggressors in order to defend the safety of our motherland and the lasting peace of the world.

    The statement of the China Political Science and Law Society said: The US imperialists' heinous crime of spreading bacteria has seriously undermined the resolution adopted by the World Peace Congress representing the will of the people of the world to prohibit the use of bacteriological weapons, and completely violates all international laws prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons. We believe that this crime of US imperialism will surely suffer heavy blows and punishment from the Chinese and Korean people, and these war criminals who use bacteriological weapons will surely suffer severe sanctions from the people of the world.

    The Chinese Pharmaceutical Association held a meeting on the 7th to discuss bacteriological warfare defense matters, and issued a declaration protesting the heinous crime of US imperialism in conducting bacteriological warfare. The declaration said: This move by US imperialism once again proves the inhumane crimes of the US aggressor army! With incomparable hatred, we in the pharmaceutical industry face this barbaric beastly act and will further strengthen our unity, work actively and diligently in our respective positions, and give the aggressors a powerful counterattack. The motherland needs medicines, whether for prevention or treatment, as long as we are given the task, we will definitely work harder to complete it. At the same time, when the motherland needs us, we are always ready to go to the front line and strive for the final victory in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea.

    The Chinese Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Society issued a letter of protest and sent a notice to its branches in various places, requesting the branches in various places to study specific methods for preventing bacteriological warfare in veterinary medicine, and to carry out propaganda work in conjunction with local science federations, medical associations, and entomological societies.

    All members and workers of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese Red Cross issued a statement, in addition to lodging a serious protest against the heinous crime of US imperialism in spreading bacteria, and called on all members and medical workers in the city to form an epidemic prevention team, ready to be dispatched at any time, and to resolutely fight to the end for the eradication of bacteria and epidemic prevention work!

    The Nurses' Association of the Beijing Medical and Health Joint Association also issued a statement, determined to actively prepare and respond to the government's call at any time to participate in epidemic prevention and rescue work.

    The Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers, Beijing Mass Literature and Art Creation Research Association, Beijing People's Fine Arts Studio, Beijing Amateur Art School, Beijing Yipei Opera School, Beijing Blind Artists Training Class, Beijing Peking Opera Association, Beijing Pingju Opera Association, Beijing Quyi Association, Capital Experimental Peking Opera Troupe, Capital Experimental Pingju Opera Troupe jointly issued a statement calling on all literary and art workers in the city to use various literary and artistic weapons to attack the US bandits' conspiracy to expand the war of aggression.

    The statement of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce said: We, all industrialists and businessmen, firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement. We in the industrial and commercial circles must do a good job in the anti-theft movement, thoroughly eliminate the filth and poison we brought from the old society, rectify our enterprise internally, engage in new democratic economic construction under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, support the Volunteer Army, and completely smash the shameless conspiracy of the US imperialists.
