    Jinbaotun Grain Station of Jerim League, Inner Mongolia
    Should Conduct Self-Criticism for Violating National Price Policies
    Editor: The Jinbaotun Grain Station of the Inner Mongolia Jerim League Grain Company violated national price policies by purchasing grain across provincial borders, causing serious losses to the state. At the end of last December, the grain station purchased 198,000 kilograms of rice from the private Zhongchao Rice Mill in Shuangliao County, Liaoxi Province, at a price of 340 yuan per kilogram above the listed price, resulting in a loss of more than 67 million yuan to the state. In the contract, both parties agreed to pay in three installments. However, the person in charge of the grain station paid the full amount at once, causing the private merchant to invest a large amount of the funds into the market, which caused fluctuations in grain prices and affected the local grain company's control over market grain prices. The Jinbaotun Grain Station's actions of violating policies, inflating prices, and purchasing across provincial borders are, in my opinion, very serious mistakes. The responsible cadres of the Jinbaotun Grain Station should conduct a thorough self-criticism.

    内蒙哲里木盟金宝屯粮栈
    违反国家价格政策应作检讨
    编辑同志：内蒙古哲里木盟粮食公司金宝屯粮栈，越境采购粮食，违犯国家价格政策，使国家遭受到严重的损失。去年十二月底，该粮栈在辽西省双辽县以每公斤超过牌价三百四十元的高价，向私商中朝制米厂订购大米十九万八千公斤，使国家损失了六千七百多万元。在订立合同时，双方订明分三期交款。但该粮栈负责人却把款一次交清，以致私商收到款后，把款大量投入市场，引起粮食价格的波动，影响当地粮食公司对市场粮价的掌握。金宝屯粮栈这种违犯政策、高抬物价、越境采购的行为，我认为是很严重的错误，金宝屯粮栈负责干部应作深刻的检讨。
