    [Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The news that the U.S. aggressors colluded with Japanese bacterial warfare criminals to conduct bacterial warfare aroused great anger among the people in the suburbs of Harbin, the suburbs of Changchun, Ningbo and other places who had been poisoned by Japanese bacteria. They unanimously protested against the towering crimes of the U.S. imperialists.

    The residents of Yifayuan Village and Houerdaogou Village in the suburbs of Harbin City have an irreconcilable hatred for the crime of the Japanese bacterial warfare criminal Shiro Ishii, who forcibly occupied farmland of peasants near Pingfang Station in 1936 and established a bacterial factory (the infamous "Unit 731" headquarters), slaughtering our people. From 1940 to 1945, more than 3,000 people died in this devil's den due to Japanese bacterial experiments. On the eve of the Japanese surrender, the Japanese bandits, in order to eliminate evidence, blew up the bacterial factory and released a large number of germ-carrying rats and plague-infected fleas. In the summer of 1946, the plague occurred in the villages near the bacterial factory. In Yifayuan Village and Houerdaogou Village alone, more than 1,200 people died. In the autumn of 1946, when the plague was at its worst, almost every family in Yifayuan Village and Houerdaogou Village had patients and deaths. Old Lady Jing's family of nineteen died twelve people in four days. Liu Xiangge's daughter-in-law, Liu Tongshi, passed by the grass outside the bacterial factory, and fleas crawled all over her body. She died in less than two days. His son died of the infection at the same time. The people of these two villages are extremely angry that U.S. imperialism is using the same means that the Japanese used to kill their relatives to kill the Korean people and the Chinese and Korean People's forces. Old Lady Jing, who was victimized, sobbed and said: "The blood debt owed by the Japanese devils has not yet been paid off, and the U.S. imperialists are using the same method that the Japanese used to kill our whole family to kill the Korean soldiers and civilians and our dearest people. We will never forgive them!" The people of the two villages expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's call, work hard to increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers, to avenge the dead. The family members of the volunteers in the village also wrote to their children, instructing them to remember the bacterial disaster suffered by their hometowns and to bravely kill the enemy.

    Near Mengjiatun (three miles north of Daguang Village) in the suburbs of Changchun City, was the location of the Japanese bacterial factory known as "Unit 100". The commander of the unit was Jiro Wakamatsu. Sun Ruizong, Director of Education of the Changchun Branch of the Northeast Military Medical University, Liu Gang, Professor of the Department of Bacteriology, and Lecturer Fang Xizhe, etc., had personally inspected the area. They expressed their utmost indignation at the U.S. aggressors' blatant collusion with former Japanese bacterial warfare criminals in carrying out heinous bacterial warfare in Korea. They said: "On February 12th and 14th, 1950, we twice inspected the former Japanese 'Unit 100' bacterial factory and personally saw the Japanese massively producing bacterial weapons and highly toxic poisons, as well as the various evidence of the killing of many of our compatriots in the manufacturing process. Peace-loving people all over the world have demanded the most severe sanctions against the evil bacterial warfare criminals Jiro Wakamatsu and others; but today the U.S. aggressors openly instruct these heinous criminals to spread bacteria in large quantities in Korea, poisoning the heroic Korean people and the Chinese and Korean People's forces. All peace-loving people in the world should take action to sanction the inhuman U.S. aggressors!" Huang Hezan, professor of Northeast Advanced Veterinary School, Wen Naiji, director of Changchun Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Institute, and Xin Jun, a bacteriology expert at Northeast Infectious Disease Prevention and Treatment Hospital, also made speeches, denouncing the atrocities of U.S. imperialism, and expressing their willingness to stand at the forefront of the epidemic prevention struggle and defeat the plague brought to mankind by the U.S. imperialists! Cao Xuewen, the village chief of Daguang Village, said angrily: "The bacterial warfare criminal Jiro Wakamatsu killed countless of our compatriots in China with bacteria, and this hatred has not yet been avenged. U.S. imperialism is now instructing him to slaughter the Korean people and the Chinese and Korean People's forces. This is absolutely intolerable to us!" Liu Wanren, a villager of the village who worked as a handyman in "Unit 100," listed the bloody facts he witnessed and said with gritted teeth: "The U.S. invading army has inherited the mantle of Japanese fascism and is using bacteria to slaughter people in Korea again. We must demand these murderers pay their blood debts!"

    The residents of Ningbo City have vivid memories of the Japanese army spreading plague bacteria. On October 28, 1940, a Japanese plane dropped large quantities of wheat, flour and millet in the bustling areas of Kaiming Street and Donghou Street in Ningbo City. These items contained a large number of small poisonous insects that resembled ordinary fleas, but were slightly smaller in size and red in color (later identified as human and rat common fleas). Soon, the plague spread in this area. Of the 99 infected people who could be investigated at that time, 98 died, and only one was saved. Qian Guifa, this tiger's mouth survivor, is now a worker at the Yongsen Winery. He said with extreme anger: "I am a person who has personally suffered from bacterial poisoning. I know how inhuman bacterial warfare is. I have long been looking forward to the trial of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals; but the inhumane U.S. aggressors have colluded with this group of executioners to spread bacteria on a large scale. The U.S. imperialists think that they can scare the Chinese and Korean people with such cruel and despicable means. Their wishful thinking is completely wrong. This will only arouse our anger even more. We will strengthen our resistance to U.S. aggression and aid Korea a hundred times to stop the enemy's atrocities!" Jiang Xincai, the owner of Baochangxiang Cotton Weaving Factory, whose entire family of fourteen was killed by the plague, and He Fuqin, the head of the first sales branch of Yongsenheng Wine Company, whose family of six was killed by the plague, cried bitterly when they talked about the suffering from Japanese poisoning. They said angrily: "We were ruined by the Japanese bacterial warfare criminals. This hatred has not yet been avenged. Now the U.S. aggressors are spreading bacteria in Korea, killing our dearest people. We want to file a complaint with the peace-loving people all over the world and demand that these murderers be given a just condemnation and the most severe sanctions." Sun Jinqi, deputy director of the Ningbo Medical Workers Association and director of medical affairs at the Workers' Hospital, who participated in the plague prevention and control work that year, said: "The tragic situation in the epidemic area that year was truly unbearable to witness. As a witness to the Japanese bacterial warfare, I can prove that the U.S. aggressors using bacteria as a tool of war is the most inhumane act and completely violates human justice and international law."

    曾遭日寇细菌毒害的哈尔滨长春宁波等地人民
    抗议侵朝美军勾结日本战犯进行细菌战争
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：美国侵略者勾结日本细菌战犯进行细菌战争的消息传到曾经遭受日寇细菌毒害的哈尔滨市郊、长春市郊、宁波市等地后，激起了当地人民的极大愤怒，他们一致抗议美帝国主义者的滔天罪行。
    哈尔滨市郊义发源村和后二道沟村居民，对日本细菌战犯石井四郎一九三六年在平房站附近，强占农民土地，建立了细菌工厂（即恶名昭彰的“第七三一部队”的驻地），屠杀我国人民的罪行，有着不共戴天的仇恨。从一九四零到一九四五年，因日寇进行细菌实验而在这个魔窟里死去的有三千多人。当日寇投降的前夕，日本强盗为了消灭罪证，炸毁了细菌工厂，放出了大量的保菌鼠和染有鼠疫的跳蚤。一九四六年夏天，细菌工厂附近各村都发生了鼠疫，仅义发源村和后二道沟村就死了一千二百多人。一九四六年秋天，是鼠疫最猖獗的时期，义发源村和后二道沟村几乎每家都有病人和死人。靖老太太全家十九口人，四天中就死了十二口人。刘相阁的儿媳刘佟氏路过细菌工厂外面的草地，全身都爬上了跳蚤，不到两天就死了。他的儿子受了传染同时死去。这两村的人民对于美帝国主义用过去日寇杀害他们亲属的手段来杀害朝鲜人民和朝中人民部队，无不愤怒万分。受害的靖老太太泣不成声地说：“日本鬼子欠下的血债还没有还清，美帝国主义者又使用日寇杀害我们全家的办法来杀害朝鲜军民和我们最可爱的人，我们绝不能饶恕他们！”两村人民表示坚决响应毛主席的号召，努力增加生产，厉行节约，支援中国人民志愿军，为死难者报仇雪恨。村中的志愿军家属们也纷纷写信给他们的子弟，嘱咐他们记住家乡遭受的细菌灾难，奋勇杀敌。
    长春市郊孟家屯（在大广村北三里）附近，原是日寇细菌工厂号称“一零零部队”的驻地。部队长就是若松次郎。东北军医大学长春分校教育主任孙瑞宗、细菌系教授刘刚，讲师房希哲等，曾亲往该地视察过。他们对于这一次美国侵略者公然勾结前日本细菌战犯，在朝鲜进行伤天害理的细菌战争，表示万分愤恨。他们说：“一九五零年二月十二、十四日两天，我们曾两次视察过前日寇‘一零零部队’细菌工厂，亲眼看到了日寇大量制造细菌武器和烈性毒药，以及在制造过程中杀害了我们许多同胞的种种罪证。全世界爱好和平的人民，都曾要求给予万恶的细菌战犯若松次郎等以最严厉的制裁；但今天美国侵略者却公然指使这些罪不容诛的恶徒们在朝鲜大量撒布细菌，毒害英勇的朝鲜人民和中朝人民部队。全世界一切爱好和平的人民应该行动起来，制裁绝灭人性的美国侵略者！”东北高级兽医学校教授黄和赞、长春市传染病防治所所长温乃即、东北传染病防治院细菌学专家辛钧等，也都发表谈话，痛斥美帝国主义的暴行，并表示要站在防疫斗争的最前列，战胜美帝国主义者带给人类的瘟疫！大广村村长曹学文愤怒地说：“细菌战犯若松次郎在中国不知用细菌害死了我们多少同胞，这个仇还没有报，美帝国主义又指使他来屠杀朝鲜人民和中朝人民部队，这是我们绝对不能容忍的！”曾在“一零零部队”做过杂工的该村村民刘万仁，列举目睹的血腥的事实后咬牙切齿地说：“美国侵略军继承日本法西斯的衣钵，又在朝鲜使用细菌屠杀人民，我们一定要向这些杀人犯讨还血债！”
    宁波市居民对日寇撒布鼠疫细菌的罪行记忆犹新。一九四零年十月二十八日，日寇飞机一架于宁波市开明街、东后街一带热闹地区，撒下大批小麦、面粉和粟。这些物品里面有大量状似普通跳蚤，但形体略小，颜色发红的小毒虫（后经判明为人鼠共同蚤）。不久鼠疫就在这一地区蔓延起来。当时可查考的九十九个染疫人中，死掉了九十八人，仅有一人被救活。这一个虎口幸存者钱贵法，现在是永森酿酒厂的工人，他极端愤怒地说：“我是亲身遭受过细菌毒害的人，深知细菌战争是多么惨无人道，我早期待着审讯日本细菌战犯；可是灭绝人性的美国侵略者竟勾结了这批刽子手，大规模地撒布细菌。美帝国主义者以为用这样残酷卑劣的手段，就可以吓倒中朝人民，它的如意算盘是完全打错了，这只有更加激起我们的愤怒，我们将百倍地增强抗美援朝力量，来制止敌人的暴行！”全家被鼠疫害死了十四个人的宝昌祥棉织厂老板蒋信财和一家被鼠疫害死了六个人的永森珩酒公司一分销处主任何福钦，一谈起遭受日寇毒害的事就痛哭失声，他们愤怒地说：“我们给日本细菌战犯弄得家破人亡，这个仇还没有报，现在美国侵略者又在朝鲜撒布细菌，杀害我们最可爱的人，我们要向全世界爱好和平的人民提出控诉，要求给予这些杀人魔鬼以正义的声讨和最严厉的制裁。”当年曾参加鼠疫防治工作的宁波市医务工作者协会副主任、工人医院医务主任孙金硂说：“当年疫区的惨状真是不忍卒睹。我以日寇进行细菌战争的见证人的资格，证明美国侵略者把细菌作为战争工具，实在是最惨无人道的行为，是完全违反了人类正义和国际公法的。”
