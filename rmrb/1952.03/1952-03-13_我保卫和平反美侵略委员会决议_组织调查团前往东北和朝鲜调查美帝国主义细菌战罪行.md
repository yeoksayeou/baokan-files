Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression held an enlarged meeting at 2:00 PM on the 12th and resolved to organize an "Investigation Team into the Crimes of American Imperialist Germ Warfare." Those present included Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Committee, Vice-Chairmen Chen Shutong, Standing Committee members Situ Meitang, Li Lisan, Li Siguang, Shen Junru, Shen Yanbing, Xing Xiping, Shao Lizi, Ma Yinchu, Zhang Xiruo, Xu Baoju, Liang Xi, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zemin, Jiang Nanxiang, Liao Chengzhi, and representatives from various parties and people's organizations such as Cai Tingkai, Li Dequan, Chen Qiyuan, Fu Lianzhang, Zeng Zhaolun, Zhou Jianren, Mei Ru'ao, Yang Xiandong, Shen Zijiu, Li Zong'en, and Fang Shishan, totaling more than 40 people.

    The meeting was presided over by Chairman Guo Moruo. After describing the crimes of American imperialism in spreading large quantities of germ-carrying insects in Korea since January 28, 1952, and in Northeast China since February 29, he said: This inhuman, heinous, and madly brutal behavior by the American aggressors is absolutely intolerable to us. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai has twice issued stern protests to American imperialism regarding its crimes of germ warfare. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, various democratic parties, and the people of the whole country have also angrily condemned the serious provocations of the American aggressors. Fair-minded public opinion throughout the world has also unanimously issued righteous condemnations of the crimes of the American aggressors. Guo Moruo concluded by saying: American imperialism is taking the risk of defying world opinion to carry out inhuman germ warfare, but it will not scare the heroic Korean and Chinese people. The American aggressors will surely reap the evil consequences of their actions.

    Zeng Zhaolun, Fang Shishan, Yang Xiandong, Huang Yanpei, Shen Junru, Fu Lianzhang, Li Zong'en, Li Siguang, and others also spoke at the meeting, unanimously and angrily denouncing the American imperialists' brutal actions of blatantly trampling on international conventions and making themselves enemies of humanity.

    In order to thoroughly investigate the atrocities committed by American imperialism in carrying out germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China, the meeting unanimously approved the organization of an "Investigation Team into the Crimes of American Imperialist Germ Warfare" to conduct on-the-spot investigations in various parts of the Northeast and on the Korean front.
