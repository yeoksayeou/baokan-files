    Beijing Decides to Thoroughly Eliminate the Theft Activities of House Speculators and Brokers; Illegal House Speculators and Brokers Must Thoroughly Confess to Seek Lenient Treatment from the People's Government
    [Our Newspaper] After the Beijing Municipal Committee for the Promotion of Economy and Examination of Purchasing Housing established a Housing Inspection Group in mid-February, it immediately began to investigate illegal cases in the purchase of houses by various levels of government organs, military units, and organizations in the capital. For more than a month, the group has worked closely with relevant units and, based on the decision of the Municipal People's Government, has taken resolute measures to severely punish those house speculators and brokers who have committed heinous crimes of stealing state wealth.
    The Beijing Military Control Commission's proclamation on housing issues in the city on May 16, 1949, clearly stipulated: "No one shall engage in speculation, 'substitution of inferior goods for superior,' or any acts that damage housing." The Municipal People's Government also explicitly banned house brokers, but there are still many house speculators who engage in reselling houses, colluding with house brokers, and bribing cadres to sell houses purchased at low prices to government organs at high prices after slightly renovating them, often making several times the profit in the process. Many house brokers who disregard government decrees systematically drag cadres into the mire, steal information about government organ house purchases, collude with house speculators or owners, and inflate house prices, rampantly undermining the People's Government's housing policy.
    According to preliminary statistics, since liberation, various levels of government organs, military units, and organizations in the capital have purchased more than 1,800 houses, paying over 330 billion yuan in house payments. Due to the illegal activities of house speculators and brokers, the state has suffered huge losses. For example, Pang Xijiu (who has been arrested), the manager of Ziying Jiuji Automobile Company and a profiteer, bought a house for 950 bolts of cloth, and after renovating it, sold it to a certain central government organ at a price of 6,200 bolts of cloth. According to existing materials, Pang committed theft of state wealth amounting to 900 million yuan in this one instance.
    The Beijing Municipal Committee for the Promotion of Economy and Examination of Purchasing Housing has decided to handle those house speculators and brokers who engage in speculation by taking advantage of housing, in accordance with the principle of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance." All house speculators and brokers with illegal activities must immediately make a thorough confession to the Housing Inspection Group. Confession will be dealt with leniently, otherwise, severe punishment will be imposed; at the same time, the people of all circles in the city are welcomed to actively report and expose them.
    The office of the Housing Inspection Group is located at No. 10 Qian Gongyong Ku, Xinjiekou. The first and third district groups are at No. 11 Zhushikou Street, the second and fourth district groups are at No. 10 Qian Gongyong Ku, the fifth district group is at No. 1 Toutiao, Nanchang Street, and the outer urban area (including the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth districts) group is at No. 183 Dongzhushikou.

    北京市决定彻底肃清房贩房纤的盗窃活动
    违法的房贩房纤必须彻底坦白争取人民政府宽大处理
    【本报讯】北京市节约检查委员会机关购房检查组于二月中旬成立后，即着手检查首都各级机关、部队、团体购买房屋中的违法案件。一个多月来，该组已与各有关单位密切配合，根据市人民政府的决定，采取了坚决措施，对那些罪大恶极的盗窃国家财富的房贩子和房纤，予以严厉的处置。
    一九四九年五月十六日北京市军事管制委员会关于本市房屋问题的布告曾明确规定：“任何人不得有借房屋倒把、‘偷梁换柱’破坏房屋之行为。”市人民政府亦曾明令取缔房纤，但仍然有不少从事倒卖房屋的房贩子，勾结房纤，贿买干部，将贱价购得的房屋略事粉刷，即高价转售给机关，转手间，往往获利达数倍之多。很多藐视政府法令的房纤，则有计划地拖干部下水，盗窃机关购房情报，伙同房贩子或串通业主，哄抬房价，猖狂地破坏人民政府的房屋政策。
    据初步统计，解放后首都各级机关、部队、团体购房共一千八百余起，付出房款达三千三百余亿元。由于房贩子和房纤从中非法活动，国家蒙受了巨大的损失。如紫鹰九记汽车行经理、奸商逄锡九（已被逮捕），用九百五十匹布买了一所房子，粉刷后即以六千二百匹布之房价卖给中央某机关。据现有材料，逄犯这一次就盗窃国家财富达九亿元之巨。
    北京市节约检查委员会机关购房检查组决定根据“坦白从宽，抗拒从严”的原则，严肃处理那些借房屋投机倒把的房贩子和房纤。凡有违法行为的房贩子和房纤，都必须立即向机关购房检查组彻底坦白。坦白将从宽处理，否则定予严惩；同时并欢迎全市各界人民踊跃检举揭发。
    机关购房检查组办公室设新街口前公用库十号，一、三区组在猪市大街十一号，二、四区组在前公用库十号，五区组在南长街头条一号，外城区（包括六、七、八、九区）组在东珠市口一八三号。（林景明）
