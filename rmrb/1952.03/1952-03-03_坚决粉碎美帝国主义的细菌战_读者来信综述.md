    Resolutely Crush the Bacteriological Warfare of American Imperialism
    ——A Summary of Readers' Letters
    The broad masses of readers continue to write to this newspaper, expressing their determination to crush the bacteriological warfare waged by the American aggressors in Korea.
    The entire team of the Beijing Anti-American Aid Korea Volunteer Surgery Team wrote: We are medical workers, soldiers fighting to eliminate bacteria and infectious diseases. Therefore, when the American bandits spread bacteria in Korea, we were extremely angry. All members of our surgery team, in addition to making the necessary preparations immediately, also request the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to organize medical workers nationwide to carry out training on destroying bacteriological warfare, and to let us go to the front as soon as possible. At the same time, we also urge all medical workers across the country to take active action and fight together to crush the shameless crimes of the American bandits.
    All staff members of the Department of Microbiology of the Central Institute of Hygiene wrote: Our job is to study how to control bacteria and eliminate infectious diseases, but the American imperialists come to spread bacteria and disseminate infectious diseases. We believe that the bacteriological weapons of American imperialism, like its atomic weapons, are paper tigers, tools of intimidation. The harm of bacteriological weapons is limited and can be defended by appropriate methods. We will not be intimidated by the American imperialists. Of course, we must be vigilant and make the necessary preparations for defense. We are ready to respond to the government's call at any time, and unconditionally accept all tasks assigned to us by our superiors, and fight to the end to crush the rampant attacks of the American imperialists.
    Fu Wenshou, Vice Chairman of the All-China Medical Association, and Su Zufei, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the All-China Medical Association, have already joined the third batch of volunteer medical surgery teams and are about to go to the Korean front to work. Their letter stated: After we arrive at the front, we will do our best to do a good job in epidemic prevention. We hope that medical and health workers in the rear will take action and work together to extinguish the plague created by American imperialism.
    The National Nurses Association wrote: The American aggressors' spreading of bacteria is a manifestation of their death throes. This proves that they have completely inherited the mantle of the dead German and Japanese fascists and will surely be sanctioned by the righteous people of the world. Our nurses across the country will closely unite with medical workers across the country, contribute all our strength, and resolutely strive to crush the heinous crimes of American imperialism.
    All personnel of the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology of the Peking Union Medical College wrote: Bacteria can be prevented and controlled. In order to completely destroy the bacteriological tactics of American imperialism, now is the time to contribute our greatest abilities and serve the motherland. We vow: to take active action and prepare to respond to all calls of the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Wang Yici, Xu Jianpei and other 185 students of the medical and nursing school of the college, as well as all the fourth-year students of the medical school, wrote to express their willingness to join the epidemic prevention and inspection team and go to the Korean front to fight the American aggressors.
    Women worker Su Min wrote: The monstrous crime of the American aggressors spreading bacteria is intolerable to all mothers and intolerable to women workers. We have the right and the confidence to sever the bloody claws of the American aggressors who are destroying international law and poisoning humanity. All women workers will take various effective practical actions in their work to fight to stop the shameless atrocities of the American aggressors from undermining the justice and security of all mankind!
    In addition, all teachers, students and staff of Peking University also wrote to protest the crimes of the American imperialist aggressors spreading bacteria.

    坚决粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战
    ——读者来信综述
    广大读者继续写信给本报，表示有决心粉碎美国侵略军在朝鲜进行的细菌战。
    北京市抗美援朝志愿手术队全体队员来信说：我们是医务工作者，是为了消灭细菌、传染病而奋斗的战士。所以，当美国强盗在朝鲜撒布细菌的时候，我们愤恨极了。我们全体手术队队员，除即刻作必要的准备外，并要求抗美援朝总会组织全国范围内的医务工作者，实行关于摧毁细菌战的训练，并早日让我们开赴前线。同时，我们更要求全国医务工作者们，积极地行动起来，共同为粉碎美国强盗的无耻罪行而斗争。
    中央卫生研究院微生物学系全体工作人员的来信说：我们的工作是研究如何控制细菌，消灭传染病，而美帝国主义者却来撒布细菌，散布传染病。我们认为，美帝国主义的细菌武器同他的原子武器一样，是纸老虎吓人的工具。细菌武器的危害是有一定限度的，可以用适当的方法来防御的。我们不会被美帝国主义者吓倒。当然我们必须提高警惕，必须作防御上的必要准备。我们准备随时响应政府号召，随时无条件地接受上级交给我们的一切任务，为粉碎美帝国主义者的猖狂进攻奋斗到底。
    中华医学会总会副理事长富文寿、中华医学会上海分会理事长苏祖斐已经参加了第三批志愿医疗手术队，就要到朝鲜前线工作。他们的来信中说：我们到前线后要竭力作好防疫工作，希望后方的医药卫生工作者行动起来，共同努力，扑灭美帝国主义制造的瘟疫。
    中华护士学会来信说：美国侵略者撒布细菌，是他们垂死挣扎的表现，这证明它已完全继承了已死的德日法西斯衣钵，一定要受到全世界人民正义的制裁。我全国护士同志，将紧密地和全国医务工作者团结起来，贡献出我们的全部力量，坚决为粉碎美帝国主义的恶毒罪行而努力。
    中国协和医学院细菌免疫学科全体人员来信说：细菌是可以防治的。为了彻底摧毁美帝国主义的细菌战术，现在是贡献我们最大能力、效劳祖国的时候了。我们宣誓：积极行动起来，准备响应抗美援朝总会的一切号召。该院医护校学生王以慈、徐剑佩等一百八十五人及该院医校四年级全体学生，都来信表示，愿意参加防疫检验队，到朝鲜前线打击美国侵略者。
    妇女工作者素民来信说：美国侵略军撒布细菌的滔天罪行，是所有的母亲们不能容忍的，是妇女工作者们不能容忍的。我们有权利、有信心斩断美国侵略军破坏国际公法、毒害人类的血腥魔手。所有妇女工作者都将在自己的工作岗位上采取各种有效的实际行动，为制止美国侵略军破坏全人类正义和安全的无耻暴行而斗争！
    此外，北京大学全体师生员工也来信表示，抗议美帝国主义侵略军撒布细菌的罪行。
