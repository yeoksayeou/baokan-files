    Disability Payments and Subsidized Grain Should Be Issued Promptly in All Areas
    I believe that disability payments and subsidized grain should be issued to disabled veterans in a timely manner in all areas. I am a disabled veteran from Tong County, Hebei Province. The disability payment and subsidized grain for the first half of 1952 have not yet been issued to me. It is said that this is because it cannot be processed due to the anti-corruption campaign. However, I urgently need these subsidies for production and living expenses. I hope that the relevant leaders will expedite this matter. Wang Baorong

专栏：来信摘要

    各地应及时发放残废金和抚恤粮
    我认为各地应该及时发放残废军人的残废金和抚恤粮。我是河北省通县的残废军人。一九五二年上半年的残废金和抚恤粮，直到现在还没有发给我。据说这是因为进行反贪污运动不能办。可是，我在生产上和生活上都急迫地需要这些补助，希望有关领导方面赶快办理这件事。    王宝荣
