How the Chongqing Bourgeoisie Organized to Attack the Working Class, the Communist Party, and State Organs
Cao Diqiu, Mayor of Chongqing Municipality

The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement of the past two months, and the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence, which has unfolded in the industrial and commercial sectors, have increasingly demonstrated how the Chongqing bourgeoisie is organized and planned to attack the Communist Party, the working class, and state organs. This attack has reached an extremely rampant level. The organizational forms of their attacks are complex and diverse, but all have specific targets. We have discovered more than twenty types of illegal organizations of the bourgeoisie. These organizations have spread to many major industries, and many representatives of these industries are their organizers and leaders.

I. The book and educational supplies industry, led by Liu Qingbo, illegally organized the "Star One Gathering," with the aim of monopolizing the production of sporting goods for state-owned department stores, raising prices, and stealing state property.

II. The salt industry organized the "Star Two Dinner Party," nominally known as the "Qian Salt Group," with Wang Zhiming and Zeng Kejia as the head and deputy head, respectively. Its target of attack was the Salt Affairs Bureau, and it met once a week. In addition to exchanging economic intelligence, they also studied methods and countermeasures to attack the Salt Affairs Bureau.

III. The various illegal organizations in the iron and steel machinery industry are even more intricate and complex. Led by Gao Gongmao and Yin Renji, they organized the "Star Four Dinner Party," which included twelve larger iron and steel machinery factories in Chongqing. This organization had strict organizational rules: 1. Strict confidentiality; 2. Membership required certain procedures. Their main target of attack was Factory 101 under the Southwest Industrial Department. They colluded with Zhou Shaowen, the production section chief of Factory 101, and Chen Songbai, an outsourcing engineer, to steal state economic intelligence and various processing order plans, as well as various machine blueprints, in a coordinated and planned manner. They also enticed and corrupted more than ten other staff members. Their methods of stealing state property were: 1. Inflating prices; 2. Shoddy workmanship; 3. Mixing in scrap iron; 4. Falsifying freight charges; 5. Delaying delivery dates. According to incomplete calculations, they have stolen more than 20 billion yuan of state property through this internal and external collusion.

Furthermore, with the "Star Four Dinner Party" as its core, they controlled the Chamber of Commerce, manipulated the election of industrial and commercial representatives to the Municipal People's Congress, and seized the status of People's Representatives (Gao Gongmao, Li Zhiqin, and Wang Keming were thus "elected" as industrial and commercial representatives to the Municipal People's Congress), in order to facilitate their attacks on state organs and the theft of people's property. At the same time, they organized resistance to the enterprise democratic reforms advocated by the government. They took the opportunity of various meetings to clamor: taxes are too heavy, the labor side is going too far, the government is not providing enough care for their processing orders, etc. In reality, they were bribing state cadres, evading taxes, cutting corners, stealing state assets, and stealing state economic intelligence.

In addition to the "Star Four Dinner Party" as its core, the iron and steel machinery industry also had several other satellite organizations: One was the "Star Five Dinner Party," which consisted of eleven medium-sized machinery factories to produce the 10,000-spindle spinning machine for the Central People's Government. The purpose was to overestimate labor and materials and inflate prices in order to facilitate the large-scale theft of state property. The second was the "New Star Five Dinner Party" organized by Wu Zongkai, the manager of Huaying Iron Factory. The target of attack for this organization was the Southwest Railway Bureau. The nine factories participating in the "New Star Five Dinner Party" all negotiated in advance when contracting projects for the Southwest Railway Bureau and unanimously raised their bids together. For example, in producing straight-leg screws, bridge iron plates, hoes, and sledgehammers for the Southwest Railway Bureau, they stole a large amount of state property using this method. The third was the "Star Six Dinner Party," which was the periphery of the "Star Four Dinner Party" and was also created to monopolize processing orders from Factory 101 under the Southwest Industrial Department. The fourth was the "Shipbuilding Group," which was an organization to deal with the Navigation Bureau's monopoly on ship repair and construction. The fifth was the "Accountant Seminar," which was established by the iron and steel machinery industry specifically to study how to evade state taxes. From this, we can see how the capitalists in the iron and steel machinery industry were organized and planned to attack state organs from all aspects.

IV. The liquid fuel industry, led by Li Yuguang, organized the "Weekly Dinner Party," whose targets of attack were the State-owned Petroleum Company, the Trust Company, and the Liquid Fuel Market Management Committee. Their method of attack was to win over Hao Huanzhang and Yang Mingyuan, cadres of the Petroleum Company, and bribe Ren Xiaosong and Peng Yubo, staff members of the Market Management Committee, to achieve their goal of stealing state economic intelligence and manipulating the market.

V. The native produce export industry had two illegal organizations: one was the "Friendship Association" organized by Jian Ruiqing and Nie Yinruo, managers of Yirui Firm, and the other was the "Star Four Dinner Party" organized by Xu Wensheng, manager of Nandè¾¾ Company. The former targeted the Southwest Trade Department and the Oil and Fat Company, while the latter targeted the State-owned Native Produce Company and the Livestock Company. The former had a complete program of attack: 1. Private unity; 2. Public-private ratio; 3. Lengthening price differences; 4. Penetrating the production areas. From these four programs, we can clearly see how arrogantly the bourgeoisie was attacking the state-owned economy! What is their so-called private unity? To put it bluntly, it is that private merchants unite to attack state-owned economic organs; what is their so-called public-private ratio? It means that the state should not purchase large quantities of oil and fat, but rather allow private merchants to purchase large quantities; what is their so-called lengthening price differences? It means that the regional price differences should be expanded so that they can obtain more exorbitant profits; what is their so-called penetrating the production areas? It means that they should be allowed to penetrate the production areas to purchase large quantities, unwilling to allow state-owned companies to penetrate the production areas. In order to realize this reactionary program, they colluded with Luo Jiaxuan, the director of the business department of the Oil and Fat Company, and other relevant personnel, and influenced state trade organs and industrial and commercial organs through these personnel, in order to realize their program and achieve the goal of monopolizing the market. According to the materials currently available, this illegal organization has caused an extremely huge loss to state property. As for the "Star Four Dinner Party" of the native produce export industry, the method they adopted was to agree in advance that private merchants would not compete with each other when mountain goods arrived, but they must rush to purchase before state-owned companies; one person would come forward to lower the purchase price, and then they would share the profits equally, thereby monopolizing the market and seeking exorbitant profits.

VI. In the printing industry, there are the "Star Six Tea Party," the "Star Five Dinner Group," and the "Color Printing Joint Venture," among which the "Star Six Tea Party" and the "Color Printing Joint Venture" have a more organized and planned attack on state organs. The "Star Six Tea Party" was formed by Zhang Xingwei and Wang Gaoquan, with the aim of monopolizing the Chongqing plate-making market. They jointly decided on sixteen monopolistic programs, the main contents of which are excerpted below: Article 1 "Increase prices"; Article 4 "After stipulating a unified price, the raised portion shall be divided equally among several companies when settling accounts"; Article 5 "Settle accounts once every half month, seek the total price of the business done, and then collect the actual amount, with the remaining amount being the average distribution amount"; Article 6 "Elect an accountant at the time of settlement to handle the settlement procedures"; Article 7 "Mutual supervision and investigation rights to prevent fraud"; Article 11 "This agreement can only be amended after it is passed by the comrades who believe it should be changed"; Article 16 "The above articles are the common responsibility of the comrades and shall not be destroyed by anyone." In this way, they monopolized the plate-making market and stole a large amount of state property. Although the "Color Printing Joint Venture" is publicly owned, there is a "Star One Dinner Party" organization secretly, which actually carries out illegal monopoly of color printing, raising the price of printing labor from sixteen discounted units to twenty discounted units, and charging extra for plate fees, thereby stealing a large amount of state property. The purpose of their joint venture is not only to monopolize the Chongqing color printing market, but also to monopolize the Southwest color printing market. The "Star Five Dinner Group" (also known as the Delicious Food Group) was established to undertake the printing of various forms and account books for the Southwest Branch of the People's Bank of China. They used the so-called "carrying the sedan chair" method to raise printing prices and seek exorbitant profits from it.

VII. The rubber industry organized the "Technical Exchange Research Association" targeting the processing orders of the Southwest Military Region's Logistics Department. This organization, ostensibly under the name of technical research, meets for dinner once a month, but in reality, it is a command center for manipulating the rubber industry, monopolizing processing orders, raising prices, and cutting corners, an illegal organization that steals people's property in an organized and planned manner. Their methods of stealing state property are: First, raise the price of the main raw material, raw rubber, by one-half, and at the same time overestimate the required amount of raw materials by one-sixth; second, use inferior goods to replace good goods, such as using local sulfur instead of sublimed sulfur, pine soot instead of carbon black, and crude fatty acid instead of hard rosin acid. As a result, they stole more than 20 billion yuan of state property.

VIII. In addition, the flour industry organized the "Star Five Dinner Party" targeting the processing of the Grain Bureau and Grain Company, the sugar and canned food industry organized the "Star Six Dinner Party" targeting the processing orders of the Southwest Logistics Department, the hardware industry organized the "Sunday Dinner Party," the banking industry organized the "Daily Dinner Party," the paint industry organized the "Dinner Party," the leather goods industry organized the "Liuhe Company," the "Production Communication Group," the "Eleven-Member Group," the cigarette industry organized the "Star Six Dinner Party," the woodworking industry organized the "Planning and Calculation Group," and the bamboo and wood industry, led by Wu Zhuoyu, illegally organized a logging company, attempting to manipulate the timber in the entire Southwest region.

Moreover, in the bamboo and wood industry, there are the so-called "Four Great Aircraft," "Five Tigers," and "Soaring Hawks," in the chemical industry, there is the "Drug King," in the liquid fuel industry, there is the "Water Adulteration King," in the dried vegetable industry, there are the "Twelve Immortals," in the printing industry, there are the "Eight Great Vajras," in the warehousing industry, there are the "Four Major Families," in the pigment industry, there is the "Counterfeiting Group," in the second-hand goods industry, there are the "Four Heavenly Kings," and in the slaughtering industry, there is the "Private Stove Ancestor," and so on. The number of such names is too numerous to list individually.

The above materials are only illegal organizations in some industries that we have discovered. This shows how the bourgeoisie is organized to attack us! Their attacks are not only organized, planned, and methodical, but also have programs, targets. Whatever type of enterprise or organ the state has, they establish that type of organization to deal with it. Whatever type of cause the state wants to undertake, carry out that type of processing order or purchase, they steal state economic intelligence, buy off cadres, inflate prices, cut corners, and steal state property in an organized manner. Their attacks are so well-arranged that from Monday to Sunday, there is an attacking force in the form of a "dinner party" attacking the working class and state organs. Who says that the bourgeoisie is always scattered and does not attack the Communist Party, the working class, or state organs? This statement is obviously absurd.

In the past two years, as a result of the bourgeoisie's attacks from all sides, state property has suffered huge losses. In Chongqing alone, according to preliminary statistics based on available materials, the direct loss of state property has reached more than 400 billion yuan. If this 400 billion yuan is invested in industrial production, we can build several decent large factories and establish more industries for the country. (Xinhua News Agency)
