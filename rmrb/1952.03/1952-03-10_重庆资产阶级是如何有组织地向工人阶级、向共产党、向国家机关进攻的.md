How the Chongqing Bourgeoisie Organized to Attack the Working Class, the Communist Party, and State Organs
Cao Diqiu, Mayor of Chongqing Municipality

The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement of the past two months, and the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence, which has unfolded in the industrial and commercial sectors, have increasingly demonstrated how the Chongqing bourgeoisie is organized and planned to attack the Communist Party, the working class, and state organs. This attack has reached an extremely rampant level. The organizational forms of their attacks are complex and diverse, but all have specific targets. We have discovered more than twenty types of illegal organizations of the bourgeoisie. These organizations have spread to many major industries, and many representatives of these industries are their organizers and leaders.

I. The book and educational supplies industry, led by Liu Qingbo, illegally organized the "Star One Gathering," with the aim of monopolizing the production of sporting goods for state-owned department stores, raising prices, and stealing state property.

II. The salt industry organized the "Star Two Dinner Party," nominally known as the "Qian Salt Group," with Wang Zhiming and Zeng Kejia as the head and deputy head, respectively. Its target of attack was the Salt Affairs Bureau, and it met once a week. In addition to exchanging economic intelligence, they also studied methods and countermeasures to attack the Salt Affairs Bureau.

III. The various illegal organizations in the iron and steel machinery industry are even more intricate and complex. Led by Gao Gongmao and Yin Renji, they organized the "Star Four Dinner Party," which included twelve larger iron and steel machinery factories in Chongqing. This organization had strict organizational rules: 1. Strict confidentiality; 2. Membership required certain procedures. Their main target of attack was Factory 101 under the Southwest Industrial Department. They colluded with Zhou Shaowen, the production section chief of Factory 101, and Chen Songbai, an outsourcing engineer, to steal state economic intelligence and various processing order plans, as well as various machine blueprints, in a coordinated and planned manner. They also enticed and corrupted more than ten other staff members. Their methods of stealing state property were: 1. Inflating prices; 2. Shoddy workmanship; 3. Mixing in scrap iron; 4. Falsifying freight charges; 5. Delaying delivery dates. According to incomplete calculations, they have stolen more than 20 billion yuan of state property through this internal and external collusion.

Furthermore, with the "Star Four Dinner Party" as its core, they controlled the Chamber of Commerce, manipulated the election of industrial and commercial representatives to the Municipal People's Congress, and seized the status of People's Representatives (Gao Gongmao, Li Zhiqin, and Wang Keming were thus "elected" as industrial and commercial representatives to the Municipal People's Congress), in order to facilitate their attacks on state organs and the theft of people's property. At the same time, they organized resistance to the enterprise democratic reforms advocated by the government. They took the opportunity of various meetings to clamor: taxes are too heavy, the labor side is going too far, the government is not providing enough care for their processing orders, etc. In reality, they were bribing state cadres, evading taxes, cutting corners, stealing state assets, and stealing state economic intelligence.

In addition to the "Star Four Dinner Party" as its core, the iron and steel machinery industry also had several other satellite organizations: One was the "Star Five Dinner Party," which consisted of eleven medium-sized machinery factories to produce the 10,000-spindle spinning machine for the Central People's Government. The purpose was to overestimate labor and materials and inflate prices in order to facilitate the large-scale theft of state property. The second was the "New Star Five Dinner Party" organized by Wu Zongkai, the manager of Huaying Iron Factory. The target of attack for this organization was the Southwest Railway Bureau. The nine factories participating in the "New Star Five Dinner Party" all negotiated in advance when contracting projects for the Southwest Railway Bureau and unanimously raised their bids together. For example, in producing straight-leg screws, bridge iron plates, hoes, and sledgehammers for the Southwest Railway Bureau, they stole a large amount of state property using this method. The third was the "Star Six Dinner Party," which was the periphery of the "Star Four Dinner Party" and was also created to monopolize processing orders from Factory 101 under the Southwest Industrial Department. The fourth was the "Shipbuilding Group," which was an organization to deal with the Navigation Bureau's monopoly on ship repair and construction. The fifth was the "Accountant Seminar," which was established by the iron and steel machinery industry specifically to study how to evade state taxes. From this, we can see how the capitalists in the iron and steel machinery industry were organized and planned to attack state organs from all aspects.

IV. The liquid fuel industry, led by Li Yuguang, organized the "Weekly Dinner Party," whose targets of attack were the State-owned Petroleum Company, the Trust Company, and the Liquid Fuel Market Management Committee. Their method of attack was to win over Hao Huanzhang and Yang Mingyuan, cadres of the Petroleum Company, and bribe Ren Xiaosong and Peng Yubo, staff members of the Market Management Committee, to achieve their goal of stealing state economic intelligence and manipulating the market.

V. The native produce export industry had two illegal organizations: one was the "Friendship Association" organized by Jian Ruiqing and Nie Yinruo, managers of Yirui Firm, and the other was the "Star Four Dinner Party" organized by Xu Wensheng, manager of Nand达 Company. The former targeted the Southwest Trade Department and the Oil and Fat Company, while the latter targeted the State-owned Native Produce Company and the Livestock Company. The former had a complete program of attack: 1. Private unity; 2. Public-private ratio; 3. Lengthening price differences; 4. Penetrating the production areas. From these four programs, we can clearly see how arrogantly the bourgeoisie was attacking the state-owned economy! What is their so-called private unity? To put it bluntly, it is that private merchants unite to attack state-owned economic organs; what is their so-called public-private ratio? It means that the state should not purchase large quantities of oil and fat, but rather allow private merchants to purchase large quantities; what is their so-called lengthening price differences? It means that the regional price differences should be expanded so that they can obtain more exorbitant profits; what is their so-called penetrating the production areas? It means that they should be allowed to penetrate the production areas to purchase large quantities, unwilling to allow state-owned companies to penetrate the production areas. In order to realize this reactionary program, they colluded with Luo Jiaxuan, the director of the business department of the Oil and Fat Company, and other relevant personnel, and influenced state trade organs and industrial and commercial organs through these personnel, in order to realize their program and achieve the goal of monopolizing the market. According to the materials currently available, this illegal organization has caused an extremely huge loss to state property. As for the "Star Four Dinner Party" of the native produce export industry, the method they adopted was to agree in advance that private merchants would not compete with each other when mountain goods arrived, but they must rush to purchase before state-owned companies; one person would come forward to lower the purchase price, and then they would share the profits equally, thereby monopolizing the market and seeking exorbitant profits.

VI. In the printing industry, there are the "Star Six Tea Party," the "Star Five Dinner Group," and the "Color Printing Joint Venture," among which the "Star Six Tea Party" and the "Color Printing Joint Venture" have a more organized and planned attack on state organs. The "Star Six Tea Party" was formed by Zhang Xingwei and Wang Gaoquan, with the aim of monopolizing the Chongqing plate-making market. They jointly decided on sixteen monopolistic programs, the main contents of which are excerpted below: Article 1 "Increase prices"; Article 4 "After stipulating a unified price, the raised portion shall be divided equally among several companies when settling accounts"; Article 5 "Settle accounts once every half month, seek the total price of the business done, and then collect the actual amount, with the remaining amount being the average distribution amount"; Article 6 "Elect an accountant at the time of settlement to handle the settlement procedures"; Article 7 "Mutual supervision and investigation rights to prevent fraud"; Article 11 "This agreement can only be amended after it is passed by the comrades who believe it should be changed"; Article 16 "The above articles are the common responsibility of the comrades and shall not be destroyed by anyone." In this way, they monopolized the plate-making market and stole a large amount of state property. Although the "Color Printing Joint Venture" is publicly owned, there is a "Star One Dinner Party" organization secretly, which actually carries out illegal monopoly of color printing, raising the price of printing labor from sixteen discounted units to twenty discounted units, and charging extra for plate fees, thereby stealing a large amount of state property. The purpose of their joint venture is not only to monopolize the Chongqing color printing market, but also to monopolize the Southwest color printing market. The "Star Five Dinner Group" (also known as the Delicious Food Group) was established to undertake the printing of various forms and account books for the Southwest Branch of the People's Bank of China. They used the so-called "carrying the sedan chair" method to raise printing prices and seek exorbitant profits from it.

VII. The rubber industry organized the "Technical Exchange Research Association" targeting the processing orders of the Southwest Military Region's Logistics Department. This organization, ostensibly under the name of technical research, meets for dinner once a month, but in reality, it is a command center for manipulating the rubber industry, monopolizing processing orders, raising prices, and cutting corners, an illegal organization that steals people's property in an organized and planned manner. Their methods of stealing state property are: First, raise the price of the main raw material, raw rubber, by one-half, and at the same time overestimate the required amount of raw materials by one-sixth; second, use inferior goods to replace good goods, such as using local sulfur instead of sublimed sulfur, pine soot instead of carbon black, and crude fatty acid instead of hard rosin acid. As a result, they stole more than 20 billion yuan of state property.

VIII. In addition, the flour industry organized the "Star Five Dinner Party" targeting the processing of the Grain Bureau and Grain Company, the sugar and canned food industry organized the "Star Six Dinner Party" targeting the processing orders of the Southwest Logistics Department, the hardware industry organized the "Sunday Dinner Party," the banking industry organized the "Daily Dinner Party," the paint industry organized the "Dinner Party," the leather goods industry organized the "Liuhe Company," the "Production Communication Group," the "Eleven-Member Group," the cigarette industry organized the "Star Six Dinner Party," the woodworking industry organized the "Planning and Calculation Group," and the bamboo and wood industry, led by Wu Zhuoyu, illegally organized a logging company, attempting to manipulate the timber in the entire Southwest region.

Moreover, in the bamboo and wood industry, there are the so-called "Four Great Aircraft," "Five Tigers," and "Soaring Hawks," in the chemical industry, there is the "Drug King," in the liquid fuel industry, there is the "Water Adulteration King," in the dried vegetable industry, there are the "Twelve Immortals," in the printing industry, there are the "Eight Great Vajras," in the warehousing industry, there are the "Four Major Families," in the pigment industry, there is the "Counterfeiting Group," in the second-hand goods industry, there are the "Four Heavenly Kings," and in the slaughtering industry, there is the "Private Stove Ancestor," and so on. The number of such names is too numerous to list individually.

The above materials are only illegal organizations in some industries that we have discovered. This shows how the bourgeoisie is organized to attack us! Their attacks are not only organized, planned, and methodical, but also have programs, targets. Whatever type of enterprise or organ the state has, they establish that type of organization to deal with it. Whatever type of cause the state wants to undertake, carry out that type of processing order or purchase, they steal state economic intelligence, buy off cadres, inflate prices, cut corners, and steal state property in an organized manner. Their attacks are so well-arranged that from Monday to Sunday, there is an attacking force in the form of a "dinner party" attacking the working class and state organs. Who says that the bourgeoisie is always scattered and does not attack the Communist Party, the working class, or state organs? This statement is obviously absurd.

In the past two years, as a result of the bourgeoisie's attacks from all sides, state property has suffered huge losses. In Chongqing alone, according to preliminary statistics based on available materials, the direct loss of state property has reached more than 400 billion yuan. If this 400 billion yuan is invested in industrial production, we can build several decent large factories and establish more industries for the country. (Xinhua News Agency)

    重庆资产阶级是如何有组织地向工人阶级、向共产党、向国家机关进攻的
    重庆市人民政府市长  曹荻秋
    两个月以来的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动和在工商界展开的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争中，愈加明显地说明了重庆市资产阶级是如何有组织、有计划地向共产党进攻、向工人阶级进攻、向国家机关进攻，这种进攻已经达到了十分猖狂的程度。他们进攻的组织形式是复杂的、多样的，但都有一定的进攻对象。我们已经发现的资产阶级的非法组织共有二十余种，这些组织几乎普及许多主要行业，而这些行业的许多代表人物就是他们的组织者和领导者。
    一、图书教育用品业以刘晴波为首非法组织“星一集会”，其目的是在承制国营百货公司的体育用具中实行垄断，哄抬价格，盗窃国家财产。
    二、盐业组织“星二聚餐会”，对外名义为“黔盐小组”，以王志明、曾克家为正副组长，其进攻对象为盐务局，每周集会一次。除交换经济情报外，还研究对盐务局的进攻方法和对策。
    三、钢铁机器业的各种非法组织更为错综复杂，以高功懋、印仁基为首组织了“星四聚餐会”，参加的成员有重庆十二家较大钢铁机器厂，这一组织订有严密的组织规约：一、要严守秘密；二、会员入会必须经一定手续。其进攻对象主要为西南工业部所属一零一厂。他们勾结一零一厂生产科长周绍文、外包工程师陈松柏等里应外合，有组织、有计划地盗窃国家经济情报以及各种加工订货计划、各种机器蓝图，并拉拢腐蚀其他工作人员十多人。他们盗窃国家财产的方法：一是哄抬价格；二是偷工减料；三是搀废铁；四是虚报运费；五是延缓交货日期。他们这样里应外合盗窃国家财产，据不完全计算已达二百多亿元。
    不仅如此，他们以“星四聚餐会”为核心，把持同业公会，操纵市人民代表会议工商界代表的选举，窃取人民代表地位（高功懋、李志亲、汪克明因而被“选”为出席市人民代表会议的工商界代表），以便于他们对国家机关的进攻和人民财产的盗窃，同时，他们对政府所提倡的企业民主改革实行有组织的对抗。他们借各种会议的机会大肆叫嚣：税收重了，劳方过火了，政府对他们加工订货照顾不够等等。实际他们在向国家干部行贿，在偷税漏税，在偷工减料，在盗窃国家资财与盗窃国家经济情报。
    钢铁机器业除以“星四聚餐会”为核心而外，还有其他几种卫星组织：一是“星五聚餐会”，这一组织是为承制中央人民政府的万锭纱机，以十一家中型机器厂组成的。其目的在高估工料，哄抬价格，以便于大量盗窃国家资财。二是以华营铁工厂经理吴宗楷为首所组织的“新星五聚餐会”，这一组织的进攻对象为西南铁路局。参加“新星五聚餐会”的九家工厂，在承包西南铁路局的工程时，均事先协商好，一致共同抬标。如承制西南铁路局的直脚螺丝、桥梁铁板、锄头、鎯头等，就以此方法大量盗窃了国家财产。三是“星六聚餐会”，这一组织是“星四聚餐会”的外围，也是为垄断西南工业部所属一零一厂的加工订货而产生的。四是“造船小组”，这是对付航务局的垄断修造船只的组织。五是“会计师座谈会”，这个会是钢铁机器业专门研究如何逃避国家税收而设的。由此我们看到，钢铁机器业的资本家们是如何有组织有计划地从各个方面在向国家机关进攻。
    四、液体燃料业以李裕光为首所组织的“星期聚餐会”，其进攻对象为国营石油公司、信托公司及液体燃料市场管理委员会。他们进攻的方法，一面是拉拢石油公司的干部郝焕章、杨明远，一面是贿赂市场管理委员会工作人员任小松、彭雨波，以达到他们盗窃国家经济情报，操纵市场之目的。
    五、土产输出业有两个非法组织，一个是以义瑞行经理简瑞卿、聂隐若等为首组织的“联谊会”，一个是以南达公司经理徐文胜为首组织的“星四聚餐会”。前者以西南贸易部、油脂公司为进攻对象，后者则以国营土产公司与畜产公司为进攻对象。前者有一套完整的进攻纲领：一、私私团结；二、公私比重；三、放长差价；四、深入产地。从这四条纲领中我们很明显地看到资产阶级是如何狂妄地在向国营经济进攻！他们所谓的私私团结是什么？揭开来说就是私商们团结起来向国营经济机关进攻；他们所谓的公私比重是什么？是说在油脂收购上不让国家大量收购，而要让私商大量收购；他们所谓的放长差价，是说要把地区差价扩大，以便他们多获暴利；他们所谓的深入产地，是说让他们深入到产地去大量采购，不愿国营公司深入产地。他们为了实现这一反动纲领，勾结了油脂公司的营业部主任罗家选及其他有关人员，通过这些人员来影响国家贸易机关及工商机关，以实现他们的纲领，达到垄断市场之目的。这一非法组织，据目前已经有的材料来看，给了国家财产的损失是异常巨大的。至于土产输出业的“星四聚餐会”所采取的方法是事先协议好山货到达之时，私与私之间互不抢购，但对国营公司则必须抢先；以一人出面压低价格收购，然后共同均分，借此来垄断市场，牟取暴利。
    六、印刷业中有“星六茶话会”、“星五聚餐团”、“彩印联营社”，其中以“星六茶话会”与“彩印联营社”对国家机关的进攻为更有组织有计划。“星六茶话会”以张型巍、王高铨为首组成，其目的是为了垄断重庆制版市场。他们共同决定了十六条垄断纲领，其主要内容摘录于下：第一条
    “提高价目”；第四条“规定统一价格后，抬高部分，结账时几家均分之”；第五条“每半月结账一次，将所作生意求其总价，再去实收，余款为平均分配量”；第六条“结账时推选会计一人，担任结账手续”；第七条“相互有监督权与调查权，以防舞弊”；第十一条“本条约经同人认为有改动时，通过后才有修改权”；第十六条“以上各条，本同人有共同爱护之责，不得由任何人破坏”。他们就这样垄断了制版市场，大量盗窃了国家财产。“彩印联营社”虽属公开性质，但暗中有一个“星一聚餐会”的组织，实际对彩印进行非法垄断，抬高印工价格，由十六个折实单位涨至二十个折实单位，并多开版费，以此来大量盗窃国家财产。他们联营的目的，不仅要垄断重庆彩印市场，而且要垄断西南彩印市场。“星五聚餐团”（又名好吃团），此组织是针对承印人民银行西南区行各种表册账簿而建立，他们用所谓“抬轿子”的方法来抬高印价，从中牟取暴利。
    七、橡胶业针对西南军区军需部的加工订货组织了“技术交流研究会”。这一组织表面上以研究技术为名，每月聚餐一次，而实际则是操纵橡胶业、垄断加工定货、抬高物价、偷工减料的一个指挥台，有组织有计划地盗窃人民财产的一个非法组织。他们盗窃国家财产的方法：第一，把主要原料生胶价格抬高二分之一，同时将需要原料量高估六分之一；第二，以劣货充好货，如以土硫磺代升华硫磺，松烟代黑炭，粗脂酸代硬胶酸等。由此他们就盗窃了国家财产二百亿以上。
    八、此外，面粉业针对粮食管理局与粮食公司的加工组织了“星五聚餐会”，糖食罐头业针对西南后勤部的加工定货组织了“星六聚餐会”，五金业组织了“星期日聚餐会”，银行业组织了“每日聚餐会”，油漆业组织了“聚餐会”，皮件业组织了“六合公司”、“生产通讯组”、“十一人小组”、纸烟工业组织了“星六聚餐会”，木作业组织了“计划计算组”，木竹业则以吴绰裕为首非法组织了伐木公司，企图操纵西南全区木材。
    不仅如此，在竹木业中有所谓“四大飞机”、“五虎”、“钻天鹞子”，化学业中有“毒品大王”，液体燃料业中有“搀水大王”，干菜业中有“十二金仙”，印刷业中有“八大金钢”，仓库业中有“四大家族”，颜料业中有“造假集团”，旧货业中有“四大天王”，屠宰业中有“私爨鼻祖”等等。这一类名目之多，不能一一例举。
    以上材料仅仅是我们已经发现的若干行业中的非法组织。这说明了资产阶级是如何有组织地在向我们进攻！他们的进攻不仅有组织，有计划，有方法，而且有纲领，有对象，凡是国家有那种企业机关，他们就建立那种组织来对付。凡是国家要兴办那种事业，进行那种加工定货或者收购，他们就在那里有组织地盗窃国家经济情报，收买干部，哄抬价格，偷工减料，盗窃国家财产。他们的进攻是那样有安排，从星期一到星期日都有一个以“聚餐会”形式出现的进攻部队在向工人阶级进攻，向国家机关进攻。谁说资产阶级总是散散漫漫没有向共产党、工人阶级、国家机关进攻呢？这种说法显然是荒谬的。
    两年以来，资产阶级从各方面进攻的结果，已使国家财产遭受了巨大损失。以重庆一地来说，仅据现有材料的初步统计，国家财产直接所遭受的损失已达四千余亿元，这四千余亿元如果投之工业生产，我们就可以办几个像样的大工厂，为国家多兴办些工业。（新华社）
