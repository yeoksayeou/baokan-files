    Strengthen Spring Ploughing Leadership and Strive for Timely Sowing
    Most areas of the country have now entered the spring ploughing season. Doing a good job in spring ploughing and ensuring timely sowing are the most urgent tasks in agricultural production at present.
    We must pay attention to the season. We believe in the principle that "man can conquer nature," and the liberated people have infinite power to conquer nature. However, to conquer nature, we must first grasp and adapt to the laws of nature. If we do not seize the time and pay attention to the season, we may cause incalculable losses to the country and the people. Now is not early, and leading cadres at all levels in agricultural areas and the peasant masses should be urgently mobilized and fully engaged in spring ploughing production.
    Last spring, some areas suffered from floods or droughts, but we overcame many difficulties and carried out a lot of hard work, and successfully carried out spring ploughing and sowing. However, the spring ploughing work in some areas suffered great losses due to insufficient preparation and late start. During the autumn sowing season last year, some areas still did not do a good job in drought resistance, did not sow in time, and lacked sufficient fertilization, resulting in poor wheat seedling development. This year, we must learn from last year's lessons and strive not to miss the farming season and sow in time.
    To achieve timely sowing, there must be sufficient ideological preparation, material preparation, technical preparation, and organizational preparation. Although many places have recently had a snowfall, the threat of drought has not been eliminated. In order to be able to sow even without rain, and to ensure full seedlings, we must also engage in serious struggle. In addition to continuing to build farmland water conservancy projects, improve water conservancy management, and have supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels plan and timely allocate and supply the fertilizers needed by farmers, the most important thing at present is to mobilize the masses to plow and harrow as soon as the land thaws, plow early and plow more, to maintain soil moisture; according to the different natural conditions in various places, mobilize the masses to raise ice to moisten the soil, water the land, and spread sand to pad the soil as early as possible, and advocate using water-soaked manure instead of dry manure. Secondly, seeds must be prepared as early as possible. Local leading organs and supply and marketing cooperatives should immediately plan and allocate various seeds needed by farmers in various places, and pay special attention to preparing early-maturing and drought-resistant crop seeds, as well as crop seeds that can be sown late. In addition to instructing supply and marketing cooperatives to make full preparations, more attention should be paid to organizing farmers to exchange various improved varieties with each other. Before sowing, widespread seed soaking and seed mixing should be promoted, germination tests should be carried out, and various drought-resistant sowing technologies should be popularized and improved. Early sowing experience should be promoted, and appropriately early sowing should be advocated, so as to take advantage of the opportunity when the soil has just thawed and the soil moisture has not disappeared much, and strive for early emergence and early maturity. At the same time, the broad masses of peasants must be further organized. The spring ploughing season is the best time to greatly develop and improve agricultural production cooperative mutual aid organizations, and leading organs at all levels should actively lead the cooperative mutual aid movement of peasants, and boldly and steadily guide peasants to gradually advance in the direction of collective labor. Only by further organizing the peasant masses can we effectively prevent and combat drought, cultivate and sow in a timely manner, further improve technology, and give greater play to the potential capabilities of our country's peasants in production.
    The key to determining the success or failure of spring ploughing and sowing work lies in leadership. Leadership must be strengthened to solve some ideological problems among some cadres and the masses.
    Some cadres and peasants are satisfied with the existing preparations for spring ploughing, and believe that "everything is ready, just waiting for a thorough rain around Grain Rain." Some people have become blindly optimistic because of some recent snowfalls, and have relaxed drought prevention work. Cadres in old areas understand that agricultural production requires leadership, but some people think that "they have been leading for many years, and the masses have already figured out the way." Many county, district, and township (village) cadres are sitting and waiting for the arrival of the anti-corruption movement, but have forgotten the spring ploughing work. After the decisions and instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the Government Administration Council on launching a mass drought prevention and drought resistance movement were issued, some places established drought prevention and spring ploughing offices, but no one was specifically assigned to work in the office, or only a few cadres with weak abilities and unfamiliar with agricultural production were assigned to make up the numbers; many counties did not even formulate production and drought prevention plans, and production and drought prevention work fell into a state of spontaneity or semi-spontaneity. These phenomena must be reversed immediately. In order not to miss the farming season, spring ploughing production must be resolutely regarded as the overriding central task below the county level, and the anti-corruption struggle should be temporarily suspended. Party and government leading organs at the provincial and special district levels should extract the main responsible cadres and lead sufficient appropriate cadres to organize spring ploughing inspection teams and production work teams to immediately go to the countryside to conduct in-depth inspections, earnestly urge and specifically help various places to carry out spring ploughing work. Special districts and counties should immediately establish and improve production and drought prevention institutions. All cadres assigned to spring ploughing production posts must recognize that spring ploughing and drought prevention are a tense struggle, and the slightest slackness will delay the farming season and cause great mistakes. Cadres who have made mistakes such as corruption, waste, and bureaucratism should understand that if they are negligent in spring ploughing work, it is adding sin to sin; and if they work hard in the struggle of spring ploughing and drought prevention, they can atone for their sins.
    Counties, districts, townships (villages) should strive to hold some necessary meetings before the busiest season arrives, after careful preparation, such as people's representative meetings, district and township (village) cadre meetings, labor model meetings, mutual aid group leader meetings, etc. At these meetings and among the broad masses, check and discuss spring ploughing and drought prevention work, and mobilize everyone to unite and concentrate on production; cadres should forcefully refute all rumors and severely suppress and crack down on counter-revolutionaries who take the opportunity to engage in sabotage activities; explain the production policies and burden policies of the people's government, so that everyone understands the great significance of ensuring grain production, strictly controlling the planting area of cotton, hemp, tobacco, etc., and increasing the yield per unit area; the agricultural production plans of the major administrative regions and provinces this year should be implemented to districts, townships (villages), and even every agricultural production cooperative mutual aid organization and every peasant household. These meetings can also discuss the scientific methods of spring ploughing and sowing, summarize the experience of drought prevention and drought resistance over the years, initiate and respond to production competitions, and discuss the urgent problems that need to be solved in local production. We must be good at using various meetings and propaganda networks to carry out patient and arduous mobilization work among rural cadres and peasants, overcome conservative thinking, slack thinking, and the mentality of fear of difficulty and relying on the sky to wait for rain; conduct patriotic and production increase education, explain the great significance of this year's bumper harvest for national construction and resisting America and aiding Korea; explain that the existing improvements in life are just the beginning, and better days are yet to come, waiting for us to create them with labor. To the people in disaster areas, it should be emphasized that everyone's concerted efforts will surely overcome the disaster, and encourage everyone to have confidence in fighting the disaster. In short, in order to ensure a bumper harvest, as long as there is still one day left, we must continue to prepare; the more preparation we make, the more we will gain.
    The Party organizations in agricultural areas, especially the Party organizations in counties, districts, and townships (villages), should immediately take action and use all their strength to lead the spring ploughing and sowing work. The Party organizations in counties and districts should, to the extent possible, convene Party representative meetings and propagandist meetings, clearly and correctly tell all Party members and the broad masses the policies of the "Three Antis" movement, and specifically help some people solve ideological problems, crush the conspiracy of counter-revolutionaries to use the "Three Antis" to carry out sabotage activities, and make the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" movements, which have achieved great victories in various cities, become the driving force for promoting the patriotic production increase movement in rural areas. All Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in rural areas should take the lead in spring ploughing and sowing and the cooperative mutual aid movement, and give full play to their due leadership and vanguard role.
    The staff of state-owned farms and agricultural workers should start in a timely manner, do a good job in spring ploughing, drive the peasant masses, spread technology to the peasants, and unite the peasants around themselves to advance together!
    Agricultural labor models, agricultural production cooperative members, and mutual aid group members should organize more widely, unite more firmly, improve technology more, give more play to enthusiasm and creativity, and drive all peasants to fully engage in spring ploughing and prepare for sowing!
    All agricultural cadres, rural cadres, and peasants should recognize that spring ploughing and sowing are the key to this year's bumper harvest. Let us start from this year's spring ploughing and launch a mass patriotic and production increase movement on a larger scale than last year!

    加强春耕领导，争取及时播种
    全国大部地区目前已进入春耕时节。做好春耕工作，保证及时播种，这是当前农业生产中最迫切的任务。
    我们必须注意季节。我们是相信“人定胜天”的道理的，解放了的人民有征服自然的无穷的力量。可是，要征服自然，一定先要掌握并适应自然的规律。如果我们不抓紧时间，不注意季节，就很可能给国家人民造成不可计量的损失。现在时候已经不早了，农业地区的各级领导干部和农民群众应当紧急动员起来，全力投入春耕生产。
    去年春季，若干地区遭遇水涝或干旱的袭击，然而，我们毕竟克服了重重困难，进行了许多艰苦的工作，顺利地进行了春耕播种。但有一些地区的春耕工作，由于准备不足，动手过迟，受到了很大的损失。去秋播种期间，有些地区仍然没有做好抗旱工作，没有及时下种，而且施肥不足，麦苗发育不良。今年一定要接受去年的教训，争取不违农时，及时播种。
    要做到及时播种，必须有充分的思想准备、物质准备、技术准备和组织准备。最近许多地方虽然落了一场雪，但旱灾的威胁并未消除。为了做到不下雨也能下种，并保证全苗，我们还必须进行严重的斗争。除继续兴修农田水利、改进水利管理，并由各地供销合作社有计划地及时地调拨供应农民所需要的肥料以外，当前最重要的是要动员群众，在土地解冻后马上耕耙，早耙多耙，保持土壤水分；要依照各地不同的自然条件，动员群众及早抬冰润土、浇水饮地、铺砂垫土，提倡用水沤粪代替干粪。其次，要把种籽及早准备好。地方领导机关和供销合作社要立即有计划地调拨各地农民所需要的各种种籽，特别要注意准备早熟的、耐旱的作物种籽以及可以晚种的作物种籽。除了责成供销合作社充分准备之外，更应注意组织农民群众互相调换各种良种。播种前要普遍推广浸种拌种，进行发芽试验，普及和改进抗旱播种的各种技术。要推广早播经验，提倡适当地早种，以便趁解冻不久、土壤水分消失不多的机会，争取早日出苗，早日成熟。同时，还必须进一步把广大农民组织起来。春耕期间是大量发展和提高农业生产合作互助组织的最好时期，各地领导机关应当积极领导农民的合作互助运动，大胆地稳健地引导农民向集体劳动的方向逐步前进。只有进一步把农民群众组织起来，才可能有效地防旱抗旱、及时地耕作播种、更多地改进技术、更大地发挥我国农民在生产中的潜在能力。
    决定春耕播种工作好坏的关键在于领导。必须加强领导，解决一部分干部和群众中的一些思想问题。
    有些干部和农民满足于已有的关于春耕的一些准备工作，认为“万事俱备，单等谷雨前后一场透雨”。有些人因为近来下了一些雪，就盲目乐观起来，放松了防旱工作。老区干部是懂得农业生产需要领导的，可是有些人又认为“已经领导了许多年，群众已经摸清门道了”。不少的县、区、乡（村）干部，坐等反贪污运动的到来，却把春耕工作忘记了。在中共中央和政务院关于开展群众性的防旱抗旱运动的决定和指示发布以后，有的地方虽然成立了防旱春耕办公室，却没有专人办公，或者只分配了几个能力较弱的、不熟悉农业生产的干部去凑数；许多县连生产防旱计划也没有订，生产防旱工作陷于自流或半自流状态。这些现象必须即时扭转过来。为了不违农时，必须坚决把春耕生产作为县以下的压倒一切的中心任务，而暂不进行反贪污斗争。省和专署级的党、政领导机关，应该抽出主要负责干部，率领足够的适当的干部，组织春耕检查组和生产工作组，立即到农村去，深入检查、切实督促和具体帮助各地进行春耕工作。各专区和县应立即建立和健全生产防旱机构。凡被分配到春耕生产岗位上的干部，都要认清春耕和防旱是一场紧张的斗争，稍
    一松懈，就会延误农时，造成大错。有贪污、浪费、官僚主义等错误的干部应当明白：如果对春耕工作怠工，就是罪上加罪；而如果在春耕防旱的斗争中努力工作，则可以立功赎罪。
    各县、区、乡（村）应争取在最忙的季节到来以前，经过周密的准备，召开一些必要的会议，如人民代表会议、区和乡（村）干部会议、劳动模范会议、互助组长会议等。在这些会议上和广大群众中间，检查和讨论春耕防旱工作，动员大家团结一致安心生产；干部们要有力地驳斥一切谣言，给予乘机活动的反革命分子以严厉的镇压和打击；要讲明人民政府的生产政策、负担政策，使大家明白保证粮食生产、严格控制棉、麻、烟等的播种面积和提高单位面积产量的重大意义；要把各大行政区和各省区今年的农业生产计划贯彻到区、乡（村）以至每一个农业生产合作互助组织和每一户农民家中去。这些会议还可以讨论春耕播种的科学方法，总结历年防旱抗旱的经验，发起和响应生产竞赛，讨论当地生产中迫切需要解决的问题。我们要善于运用各种会议和宣传网，在农村干部和农民群众中进行耐心的艰苦的动员工作，克服保守思想、松劲思想以及畏难心理和靠天等雨等侥幸心理；要进行爱国增产的教育，说明今年的丰收对于国家建设和抗美援朝的重大意义；要说明生活上已有的改善只不过是刚刚开始，更好的日子还在后头，还待我们用劳动去创造。对灾区人民要强调指出大家一致努力必能战胜灾荒，鼓舞大家和灾荒作斗争的信心。总之，为了保证丰产，只要还有一天时间，我们就还要继续准备；多一分准备，就会多一分收获。
    农业地区的党的组织，特别是县、区、乡（村）的党的组织，应当立即行动起来，用全部的力量，领导春耕、播种工作。县、区的党的组织应当在可能范围内，召开党的代表会议和宣传员会议，明白地、正确地把“三反”运动的政策，告诉全体党员和广大群众，并且具体地帮助某些人解决思想问题，粉碎反革命分子利用“三反”进行破坏活动的阴谋，使各城市已取得很大胜利的“三反”、“五反”运动，成为推动农村的爱国增产运动的力量。农村的全体共产党员和青年团员，在春耕播种、合作互助运动中，应当走在最前面，充分发挥应有的领导作用和先锋作用。
    国营农场的工作人员和农业工人们，要及时动手，把春耕工作做好，把农民群众带动起来，把技术传播给农民，把农民团结在自己周围，一起前进！
    农业劳动模范们，农业生产合作社员和互助组员们，要更广泛地组织起来，更巩固地团结起来，更加提高技术，更多发挥积极性和创造性，带动全体农民，全力投入春耕，准备播种！
    全体农业干部、农村干部和农民们，要认识春耕播种是今年丰产的关键。让我们从今年的春耕开始，展开一个比去年更大规模的群众性的爱国丰产运动！
