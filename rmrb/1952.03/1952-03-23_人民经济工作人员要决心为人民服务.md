    People's Economic Workers Must Resolve to Serve the People
    Bai Shucheng
    Recently, some economic workers have developed a very incorrect idea during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, saying that "engaging in economic work is really unlucky," regretting "accepting this kind of work, now ending up being suspected," so "after the anti-corruption movement is over, no matter how good it sounds, I won't do this unlucky and scolded job." This is certainly not the attitude a people's economic worker should have; however, there are indeed quite a few people who hold this attitude. The majority of the masses believe that "in the anti-corruption movement, people have the right to suspect economic workers; but this does not mean that every economic worker is corrupt. It is believed that many people are still honest and dedicated. Some people cannot withstand the test of struggle, and actually think of ‘leaving their economic work posts immediately once the movement is over.’ This is an incorrect attitude of not considering the needs of the country politically, and adopting a passive and evasive approach to serious political tasks.” These criticisms are correct, and all relevant departments should try to correct this thinking. Economic workers with incorrect attitudes should be severely criticized to overcome their erroneous ideas.
    Currently, among our country's economic workers, there are clearly three situations: The first type of person has always been honest and dedicated, and has waged unremitting struggles against all corrupt phenomena and its root cause—the corruption of bourgeois ideology. In this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, they stand at the forefront of the struggle, becoming warriors who capture corrupt elements and encircle and suppress unscrupulous merchants. The second type of person is personally clean and has no corrupt behavior. They have clear and distinct boundaries between public and private interests, do not harm public interests to benefit private interests, do not take advantage of private merchants, and maintain a very cautious work attitude; but they are indifferent to national wealth. They abhor corrupt behavior, but do not actively fight against it; they abhor the theft and bribery of unscrupulous merchants, but do not expose or report it; and in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, they are only satisfied with their own cleanliness, adopting a passive attitude towards the movement; and when they are suspected by others, they feel full of grievances, standing in opposition to the masses who are engaged in intense battles, and even feel that engaging in economic work is "unlucky," planning to "leave their economic work posts immediately once the movement is over." In addition, some economic workers have some minor corrupt behavior. For even this minor corrupt behavior, they do not study its causes from their own thinking, but complain that their superiors assigned them to do economic work, thus also generating the idea of ​​"changing careers." The third type of person has major corrupt behavior. Some of them are unscrupulous merchants who have infiltrated state economic organs. They are enemies of the people's country, but they are ultimately in the minority.
    The active attitude taken by the first type of person towards national wealth correctly reflects the thinking of the working class. Whether in the past or present, they are the defenders of state property and are role models for economic workers. They should continue to carry forward this patriotic ideology and more actively participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, striving to thoroughly defeat the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks. As long as they do not carry the burden of "resting on their laurels" and adopt a humble and cautious attitude, they will be able to make more and greater achievements in actively working for the country and the people.
    The attitude taken by the second type of person towards national wealth is "taking care of oneself" and "keeping oneself pure." They only seek personal cleanliness, as for eliminating the poison left over from the old society, they think it is not their responsibility, so in the anti-corruption movement, they become "dead corners." This is a typical petty-bourgeois thought. The political manifestation of this thinking is corrupt liberalism. They turn a blind eye to the criminal acts of stealing national wealth, letting them go unchecked. Although they themselves are clean, they cannot motivate others to strive to create a clean social atmosphere. This passive individualistic thinking has been unfavorable to work in the past, is now unfavorable to the movement, and will be unfavorable to our country's large-scale construction in the future. It only benefits corrupt elements and unscrupulous merchants, giving them loopholes to exploit. Therefore, we must never allow this kind of thinking to exist and develop. All those who hold this kind of thinking must wake up, learn from the first type of person, overcome petty-bourgeois thinking, replace it with the thinking of the working class, and actively participate in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle.
    They may say, "There are many roads to revolution, why must I do this economic work that is easy to provoke trouble? Can't I serve the people in other positions as well?" They do not understand that in any position, there are fierce struggles. If you are afraid of revolutionary struggle, then you will not be able to stand firm in any position. For example, in this movement, some leaders listened to the criticisms of the masses and thought, "I work hard all day long, but instead I get so much resentment. Why should I do this leadership work? Doing general work is also serving the people." This is essentially the same as the aforementioned "changing careers" idea. So the problem is not what kind of work you do, but the attitude you hold towards the struggle. As long as you are brave enough to participate in the struggle, it is the same in any work position, not to mention that the economic front is one of the most important fronts, and the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement being carried out today is also one of the focuses of the economic sector. Every people's economic worker should focus their attention on repelling the bourgeoisie's attack and fighting to defend the working class's leadership.
    As for the attitude taken by the third type of person towards national wealth, it nakedly reflects the bourgeoisie's reactionary thinking. The only way out for this kind of person is to bravely confess all their criminal behavior in order to seek lenient treatment from the people. In terms of attitude towards national wealth, every economic worker should be good at distinguishing between the thinking of the working class, the petty-bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie. Eliminate the bourgeoisie's reactionary thinking, overcome the petty-bourgeoisie's "taking care of oneself" thinking, and carry forward the working class's active defense of national wealth thinking. All the activists among the economic workers should continue to forge ahead courageously; all the personnel who hold the "taking care of oneself" thinking should actively take action and catch up; all the corrupt elements should turn back as soon as possible, thoroughly confess, and perform meritorious service to redeem their crimes. All state economic workers, except for major corrupt criminals with heinous crimes, should unite as one, fight to victoriously repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attack, continue to adhere to the glorious position of economic work, and serve the people for life.

    人民经济工作人员要决心为人民服务
    白树诚
    近来有一部分经济工作人员在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中产生了一种极不正确的思想，说什么“干经济工作真倒霉”，后悔“接受了这种工作，现在落得叫人家怀疑”，因此“在反贪污运动结束以后，说一万个好，也不干这种倒霉而又挨骂的工作了”。这当然不是一个人民经济工作人员应有的态度；但是，抱有这种态度的人也的确不少。多数群众都认为“在反贪污运动中，人们有权利怀疑经济工作人员；但这决不是说每一个经济工作人员都有贪污行为。相信许多人还是廉洁奉公的。有些人经不起斗争的考验，居然想‘一旦运动结束，马上离开经济工作岗位’。这是不从政治上考虑国家需要，对严肃的政治任务采取消极逃避的不正确态度。”这些批评是对的，各有关部门，都应该设法纠正这种思想，对于抱有不正确态度的经济工作人员应加以严正的批评，克服他们的错误思想。
    目前在我们国家经济工作人员中，显然有三种情况：第一种人，一贯廉洁奉公，并对一切贪污现象及其根源——资产阶级思想的腐蚀，进行了坚持不懈的斗争。在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，他们站到斗争的前线，成为捕捉贪污分子、围剿奸商的勇士。第二种人，个人一身清白，没有贪污行为。他们有清楚而明确的公私界限，不损公肥私，不沾私商的便宜，工作态度十分谨慎；但是对于国家财富则是漠不关心的。他们嫌恶贪污行为，却不积极地与之斗争；他们嫌恶奸商的盗窃、行贿勾当，却不加以揭发、检举；而在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，则只满足于个人本身的清白，对运动采取消极态度；而当他们被别人怀疑时，则感到满腹委曲，和正在进行紧张战斗的群众对立起来，甚至感到干经济工作是“倒霉”的，打算“一旦运动结束，马上离开经济工作岗位”。另外，也有些经济工作人员，有点微小的贪污行为。对于这种即令是微小的贪污行为，他们不从自己思想上去研究它的产生原因，而埋怨上级分配自己作了经济工作，因而也产生了“改行”的思想。第三种人，是有大的贪污行为的。其中一部分是混入国家经济机关的奸商。他们是人民国家的敌人，但毕竟是少数的。
    上述第一种人对国家财富所采取的积极态度，正确地体现了工人阶级的思想。不论在过去和现在，他们都是国家财产的保卫者，是经济工作人员的榜样。他们应该继续发扬这种爱国主义思想，更积极地参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，为彻底打垮资产阶级的猖狂进攻而努力。只要他们不背起“功臣自居”的包袱，采取谦虚谨慎的态度，他们就能够在为国家和人民积极工作中做出更多更大的成绩。
    第二种人对于国家财富所采取的态度，是“独善其身”“洁身自好”。他们只求个人的清白，至于肃清旧社会遗留下的污毒，则以为不是自己的职责，因而在反贪污运动中，他们就成了“死角”。这是一种典型的小资产阶级思想。这种思想在政治上的表现，就是腐朽的自由主义。他们对于盗窃国家财富的罪恶行为，熟视无睹，听之任之。他们虽然本身是清白的，但不能带动别人为创造廉洁的社会风气而奋斗。这种消极的个人主义的思想，过去已不利于工作，现在则不利于运动，将来也不利于我们国家的大规模的建设事业，它只利于贪污分子和奸商，给他们以可钻的空子。因此，我们对于这种思想决不能让其存在和发展。一切抱有这种思想的人，必须猛醒，向第一种人看齐，克服小资产阶级思想，代之以工人阶级的思想，积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争。
    他们也许会说：“条条大路通革命，我何必一定作这容易招惹是非的经济工作？在别的岗位上不也一样可以为人民服务吗？”他们不了解，在任何岗位上，都有着激烈的斗争。如果对于革命斗争是畏惧的，那么在任何岗位上都一样站不住。例如在这次运动中，有些领导人员听了群众的批评意见，就想：“我一天到晚辛辛苦苦地工作，反而落这么多埋怨。我何必作这领导工作，作一般的工作也一样为人民服务。”这和前述的“改行”思想本质上是一样的。所以问题不在于从事什么工作，而在于对斗争所持的态度。只要勇于参加斗争，在任何工作岗位上都一样，何况经济战线乃是最重要的战线之一，今天进行的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，经济部门又是重点之一，每一个人民经济工作人员都应该把注意力集中于打退资产阶级的进攻，为保卫工人阶级的领导权而战斗。
    至于第三种人对待国家财富所采取的态度，则露骨地反映了资产阶级的反动思想。这种人的唯一出路是勇敢地坦白自己的一切犯罪行为，以求人民的宽大处理。在对待国家财富的态度上，每一个经济工作人员，都应该善于区别工人阶级的、小资产阶级的、资产阶级的思想。肃清资产阶级的反动思想，克服小资产阶级的“独善其身”的思想，发扬工人阶级的积极保卫国家财富的思想。一切经济工作人员中的积极分子，应该继续奋勇前进；一切抱有“独善其身”的思想的人员，应该积极行动起来，迎头赶上；一切贪污分子，应该及早回头，彻底坦白，立功赎罪。全体国家经济工作人员除罪大恶极的大贪污犯以外，应该一致团结起来，为胜利地打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻而斗争，继续坚持经济工作的光荣岗位，终身为人民服务。
