The executioner who murdered Comrade Fang Zhimin, bandit leader Zeng Zhongjun, was arrested.

[This News Report] Bandit Zeng Zhongjun, the executioner who harmed Comrade Fang Zhimin, was captured in Shimen County, Hunan Province, in October 1951.

Bandit Zeng was from Ruijin, Jiangxi Province, and consistently participated in counter-revolutionary and anti-people criminal activities. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War period, Bandit Zeng actively served as a henchman in the so-called "encirclement and suppression" campaigns launched by the Chiang bandits. In March 1931, Bandit Zeng was appointed as the Kuomintang Bandit "Military Commission Nanchang Provisional Headquarters," "Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong Border Area Bandit Suppression" Colonel Liaison Officer. Subsequently, Bandit Zeng was transferred to serve as a regimental commander. In the winter of 1934, Bandit Zeng led the Bandit 96th Division's 696th Regiment, in coordination with a regiment of the Bandit 5th Division and the Bandit Zhejiang Security Brigade, to besiege the Northern Expedition Anti-Japanese Vanguard, led by Comrade Fang Zhimin, in the Gan-East base area in three directions. After half a month of fierce fighting, Comrade Fang Zhimin led his troops to break through and retreat into the deep mountains of the Hekou, Yushan, and Shangrao areas between Gan-East and Zhejiang-West, persisting in the struggle. Comrade Fang Zhimin and his subordinates suffered great losses at the time due to exhaustion of food and ammunition, and they decided to leave the main force and return to the Gan-Northeast base area to reorganize their forces in preparation for carrying out new tasks. When Comrade Fang Zhimin bypassed the enemy's blockade line, he was captured by Bandit Zeng in January 1935 due to a traitor's betrayal. Comrade Fang Zhimin demonstrated the noble revolutionary quality of a firm and unyielding Communist Party member in prison. He died heroically in Nanchang in July 1935.

From then on, Bandit Zeng gained further trust from the Chiang bandits. He was transferred to the Kuomintang Army University's General Class for training. After training, he was promoted to Bandit Division Commander and Major General Commander, among other positions.

After liberation, Bandit Zeng initially hid in Changde, attempting to flee to Sichuan to join Bandit Song Xilian. After Bandit Song Xilian was captured alive by us, Bandit Zeng went into hiding in the deep mountains of Shimen, continuing to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. In October 1951, the Public Security Bureau of the People's Government of Shimen County finally captured this extremely heinous counter-revolutionary element in Qinglong Temple, District 7.

    杀害方志敏同志的刽子手
    曾匪中俊已被捕获
    【本报讯】残害方志敏同志的刽子手曾匪中俊，已于一九五一年十月在湖南石门县被捕获。
    曾匪是江西瑞金人，一贯参加反革命反人民的罪恶活动。第二次国内革命战争时期，曾匪积极地在蒋匪发动的所谓“围剿”战中，充当鹰犬。一九三一年三月，曾匪被任命为匪“军委会南昌行营”、“赣闽粤边区剿匪”上校联络员。此后，曾匪被调任团长。一九三四年冬，曾匪率领匪九六师六九六团配合匪五师之一团和匪浙江保安旅，分三路向我赣东根据地方志敏同志所领导的北上抗日先遣队围攻。经过半个月的激战，方志敏同志率领部队突围撤入赣东浙西间之河口、玉山、上饶一带深山中，坚持斗争。方志敏同志和他的部属当时因为粮尽弹绝遭受极大损失，决定离开主力部队回赣东北根据地整顿队伍，准备执行新任务。方志敏同志在绕过敌人封锁线时，因叛徒告密，遂在一九三五年一月间被曾匪所俘。方志敏同志在狱中，表现了共产党员坚定不屈的高尚的革命品质，一九三五年七月在南昌慷慨就义。
    自此以后，曾匪便取得了蒋匪进一步的信任，曾被调到匪陆军大学将官班受训，受训后，升任匪师长、少将司令等职。
    解放后，曾匪起初隐匿在常德，企图潜逃四川投奔宋匪希濂。宋匪希濂被我活捉后，曾匪潜伏在石门深山中，继续进行反革命活动。一九五一年十月，我石门县人民政府公安局终于在七区青龙寺捕获这一罪大恶极的反革命分子。（长江日报消息）
