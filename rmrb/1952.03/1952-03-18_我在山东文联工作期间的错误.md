Editor's Note: This newspaper published four letters from readers in the Readers' Letters column on February 11, February 27, and March 12, exposing the decadent bourgeois thinking and serious bureaucratic work style of certain leading cadres of the Shandong Federation of Literary and Art Circles, as well as the resulting corruption, waste, and suppression of democracy. It specifically criticized Yu Jiyu's mistakes during his tenure as Deputy Director of the Shandong Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Now Yu Jiyu has made a self-criticism, which we are publishing here. This self-criticism is not profound enough, and Yu Jiyu should more deeply and rigorously criticize his non-proletarian ideology and work style.

From the spring of 1950 to the spring of 1951, I made many mistakes in my leadership role in the preparatory committee of the Shandong Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

After the anti-corruption struggle began, I only focused on reviewing my errors of extravagance and waste in the preparatory work of the East China Federation of Literary and Art Circles (Yu Jiyu is currently the Secretary-General of the East China Federation of Literary and Art Circles - Editor) and did not seriously examine my work in Shandong. It was only after the reader's letter in the People's Daily on February 11 that I was awakened. With the education of the higher authorities and the help of comrades, I further realized the seriousness of the mistakes in my past work. Based on my current understanding, I made the following serious mistakes in my work at the Shandong Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

	I. Serious self-righteousness, personal authority, and political liberalism caused significant losses to the literary and artistic work in Shandong at that time.

First of all, I fundamentally ignored the importance of ideological leadership in literary and artistic work. I never seriously organized the study of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought in the past year, nor did I pay attention to carrying out literary and artistic criticism. As a result, the literary and artistic thought in Shandong at that time was chaotic, and my personal literary and artistic thought was chaotic in the first place.

Regarding how to organize creation, I insisted on my own subjective views, believing that the literary and art troupes and teams at all levels below the provincial and municipal levels should be led by the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, so that the literary and art troupes would be both the main force in organizing literary and artistic creation and the main force in promoting literary and artistic activities. I not only did not advocate writers going to the countryside and factories to participate in mass movements, gain experience, and engage in creation, but also rejected and restricted them ideologically and in my work. I only agreed that individual writers who came from the past Kuomintang-controlled areas could go to the countryside and factories to seek transformation; I felt that it was also possible to consider cadres from the organization rotating down for a short period; but I firmly opposed several comrades in leadership positions going down. I thought they were doing it out of personal fame and gain, and to escape leadership responsibilities. I once wrote a paper on the ideological transformation of literary and artistic cadres, criticizing this idea. Because the editorial department disagreed, it was not published; but I still partially expressed this erroneous view in other papers.

On issues related to this issue, I again made the mistake of lacking organizational discipline. In the spring of 1950, Shandong abolished the literary and art troupes, and most of the members of the literary and art troupes were concentrated for study. When I heard that East China University might move south, I arrogantly demanded that the leadership keep the art department of East China University in Shandong. The leadership solved the problem from the perspective of overall interests, and of course did not allow it. I was resentful in my heart and jointly wrote a letter, raising opinions to the leadership at a higher level. I also complained in front of lower-level cadres, thinking that there was no way to continue literary and artistic work in Shandong. Before this, I often treated my subordinates with an arrogant and bureaucratic attitude. After this, I was politically liberal. In the autumn of 1950, the literary and art troupes at the prefectural committee level were preparing to be established, and it was stipulated that they should be led by the Provincial People's Government's Department of Culture and Education. However, I requested that they be led by the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Because things could not go as I wished, I repeatedly and arrogantly demanded to concurrently do part of the work of the Department of Culture and Education. I believed that only if I led could the literary and art troupes be run well. This exposed my serious authoritative thinking. The leadership educated me, and I accepted it verbally, but I did not accept it in my heart. I adopted a more serious liberal attitude in my work and was passive in my work.

In the spring of 1950, under the leadership of the Shandong Provincial Department of Culture and Education, the "Shandong Theater" was established to engage in experimental work on drama reform. I and several other comrades from the Federation of Literary and Art Circles were responsible for the actual leadership of the theater. Although it was stipulated in the work policy of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles that the focus should be on promoting new literature and art, and that the focus of drama reform should also be on transforming local opera and creating new opera; however, because I personally preferred Peking opera, I used most of my energy to make a big splash with it. From writing the play and directing it to finding actors, I did everything myself, making it impossible for comrades in drama reform to intervene. As for the reform of local opera, I completely abandoned it. Because I preferred Peking opera out of personal interest, I neglected the leadership of new literature and art.

I have never seriously led "Shandong Literature and Art" since its publication. I rarely reviewed literary works, and only casually read a few papers, which was almost equivalent to not reviewing them at all. In 1950, the Shandong Provincial Literary and Art Creation Award was given. I was the Deputy Director of the Shandong Literary and Art Creation Award Committee. I only simply read a few of the main works that had already been initially evaluated, and did not read the others. As a result, the award work was done very hastily, and coupled with my own mistakes in understanding, I also recommended works with erroneous content.

	II. Serious extravagance and waste, patriarchal leadership, and a decadent lifestyle.

During my time at the Shandong Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Federation had a "Da Guan Cinema and Theater," which, in addition to sometimes staging plays, also showed movies. At that time, 40% of the profits were used as entertainment expenses, thus creating conditions for extravagance and waste. The most prominent of these was entertaining with meals and inviting people to the theater. Almost all literary and art workers from other places, main actors in Peking opera, and even cadres transferred from other places and cadres coming to the province for meetings were invited to meals, wasting about 20 to 30 million yuan. Especially several times, there was no excuse at all, and several leading cadres went to restaurants for meals, which were actually reimbursed by the public. There was also no standard for inviting people to the theater. Anyone familiar with me personally could be included in the list of invitees. In addition to this, more than 400,000 yuan was spent in the Federation of Literary and Art Circles to build a fish pond, wasting a lot of state property.

Because there was organizational production in hand, it also opened the door for personal convenience, blurring the line between public and private, and spending money arbitrarily. Usually, when my relatives and old friends came, I would casually tell the kitchen to add dishes. Several times, I would order dishes at a restaurant or eat at a restaurant, and the expenses would be reimbursed by the public. I would write notes to the managers at any time to get cigarettes and tea. It was as if the Federation of Literary and Art Circles had become my personal property. Even so, it still could not satisfy my personal needs for waste, and I repeatedly borrowed money and asked for things from others indiscriminately.

Due to the serious extravagance and waste, the financial system of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles at that time was seriously chaotic, and corruption occurred. It was also because of my extravagance and waste and bureaucracy that I turned a blind eye to corruption. For example, in the spring of 1950, someone secretly reported that Zhou Zhongyu, the secretary of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, was involved in corruption. However, because the informant falsely claimed to be "all the employees of the Da Guan Cinema and Theater," and there was no specific corruption material in the letter of complaint, the corruption problem was not investigated. Instead, it was mistakenly suspected on the other hand, affirming that the anonymous person was most likely retaliating out of suspicion. Therefore, the informant was investigated. At that time, although I also arranged for an inspection and cleaning of accounts for other people's secret reports, this was only to check and sort out the general account procedures, and the corruption problem was not investigated. Another example is that in the autumn of 1950, it was initially discovered that the warehouse of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the materials of the then Provincial Theater were being stolen. However, I only checked the accounts of the theater and handed over two taels of opium (originally stored in the materials of the Peking Opera Troupe) to the health center. Other theft problems were not seriously investigated. How serious this mistake was!

The reason for the above extravagance and waste and other mistakes is mainly because I was seriously eroded by bourgeois ideas after entering the city. First, I learned the vulgar custom of entertaining guests from the bourgeoisie, mistakenly regarding it as an important way of working in the literary and artistic united front, and further developed to eating, drinking, and personal enjoyment. In addition, there were still remnants of the thinking and style of the exploiting classes in me. After entering the city, when I encountered the invasion of bourgeois ideas, this kind of thinking and style quickly developed.

In the leadership of the daily work of the organization, I had a serious patriarchal style. Since the establishment of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, there has never been a formal work plan, nor has there been a formal meeting system. Sometimes I would find a few department heads to study it together, grab a point, do a little, or there would be arrangements without inspection. All kinds of problems were decided by me alone, and I rarely cared about the ideological and living conditions of the cadres. When assigning tasks, I adopted commandism and rarely paid attention to educating the cadres. In addition to running around every day, I spent a lot of time attending various meetings or sending people off and welcoming them. I rarely cared about the work of the organization. I rarely participated in the organization's studies; I rarely read Party documents.

In this way, I became a "little emperor" in a "free kingdom" within a year, high above, living in comfort, seriously divorced from the masses, and causing irreparable losses to my work. If it were not for the Party's rescue at that time and my timely transfer, it is difficult to imagine what extent I would have fallen to today.

	III. Confusion in literary and artistic creation thinking, lack of serious self-criticism.

Before I went to work at the Shandong Federation of Literary and Art Circles, I had rarely written literary works. During my time at the Shandong Federation of Literary and Art Circles, I only wrote two or three essays, one or two poems, and revised a Peking opera script. Now I will examine the confusion and seriousness of my mistakes in literary and artistic creation thinking based on two things.

In the winter of 1950, I wrote an essay entitled "On Cats," which was published in "Shandong Literature and Art." There were many serious mistakes in this short essay: using the "relationship between cats and mice" to compare "the relationship between landlords and peasants in the old days," and saying such erroneous things as "If someone wants me to forgive a villain between Hitler and Truman, I would rather forgive Hitler, although I will not spare any of them." After this article was published, readers raised criticisms in the "Literary Gazette." At that time, I only thought that the metaphor was inappropriate and there was no error of principle, so I did not prepare to make a self-criticism. Later, the "Literary Gazette" raised criticism, but I thought that the criticism was somewhat exaggerated in its wording, so I developed ideological resistance. Looking back on it today, my essay has serious errors. Whether it is comparing the peasants of the old days or the current peasants to mice, it is obviously an insult to the peasant class. This completely loses the class stand. The statement about Hitler is even more a loss of stand.

Secondly, when the Shanghai Kunlun Company came to Shandong to film the movie "The Life of Wu Xun," I was the main speaker at the symposium held by the Shandong Provincial Department of Culture and Education. I expressed extremely absurd opinions. As far as I can remember today, my opinions were roughly: "Wu Xun's behavior is undesirable and its effect is bad; but Wu Xun himself is good and his motives are good." Therefore, I proposed that Wu Xun should be written as "not to be praised, nor to be satirized," and "to expose the errors of his behavior, but also to explain the goodness of his motives," which seemed to be inexplicable, without a stand, but in fact were erroneous opinions of the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie. At that time, I also painstakingly put forward many specific revision suggestions. For example, Wu Xun should be written as a character with two sides or a dual personality; in dealing with Wu Xun, he should be made to see his own failures and mistakes step by step and finally commit suicide. This would not only explain that his behavior was wrong, but also make it easier to explain that his motives were good, etc. On this issue, I not only did my best to distort historical facts, but also actively sponsored the reactionary ideas of the bourgeoisie.

The reason for the above mistakes is that my literary and artistic thinking is extremely chaotic. Although I have undergone years of revolutionary struggle, my thinking has not been thoroughly transformed. In the depths of my soul, there are still thick roots of petty bourgeois and even bourgeois ideological feelings. Whenever there is an opportunity, they are exposed.

After the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" began, the leadership in Shandong ordered me to examine myself carefully. However, I lightly wrote a long paper, but rarely criticized myself. The article was not published, and I went to work on visiting the old revolutionary base areas. After returning, I was quickly transferred away from Shandong. At this time, there was a clear conclusion on the errors of "The Life of Wu Xun," and the discussions in various places had also largely come to an end, so I muddled through and did not prepare to examine myself again. After coming to the East China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, I continued to see criticisms of my essay "On Cats." The leadership repeatedly urged me to make a self-criticism. I also wrote one lightly, but there was more explanation than self-criticism. The leadership also did not agree to publish it, and I was prepared to muddle through. I thought that there was nothing wrong with examining the bureaucratic leadership style, because this was inevitable in work; I didn't care much about examining the lifestyle, because this was a minor detail of life; but it was quite painful to examine the errors in my creative thinking. This was not only due to my own errors in understanding and insufficient understanding of the harm and seriousness of my bureaucratic leadership style and lifestyle, but also because I had serious individualistic thinking, gains and losses, and lacked the spirit of serious self-criticism. I felt that as a leading cadre of literary and artistic work, I had made mistakes in literary and artistic creation thinking. This erroneous thinking not only seriously hindered me from correcting the errors in literary and artistic thinking in a timely manner, but also was the main reason why I had been constantly making mistakes in leadership work for a long time, following the old ways and failing to correct them in a timely manner.

	IV. The interests of the Party are above all else, and the interests of the people are above all else. I am not allowed to continue to make mistakes.

Through this great anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, my ideological awareness has gradually improved, and I have gradually realized the seriousness of my past mistakes. The past relaxation, paralysis, and nonchalant mood have gradually turned heavy. I began to make a preliminary self-criticism at the general meeting of all cadres of the East China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. However, at the beginning, I still had some resistance to the criticisms in the readers' letters in the newspaper twice, thinking that some of the situations and statements were somewhat exaggerated, and always thought of some reasons to defend myself; instead of completely and unreservedly strictly examining myself. In fact, the comrades' criticisms are only insufficient, how can they be excessive? This only shows that I am still forgiving and condoning myself in many ways.

Under the education of the higher authorities and the help of comrades, after a more serious and fierce ideological struggle, I realized the evil consequences caused by my erroneous ideology and work style, and I should be responsible for all this, and not push it to the objective. After I came to the East China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, although the higher authorities repeatedly warned me, didn't I still cause many extravagant and wasteful mistakes? This completely proves that I have serious errors in my thinking and style without realizing it, and that I have already stepped into the trap of degeneration without knowing it!

In the anti-corruption struggle, I truly realized that I was being rescued from danger. I truly further realized the greatness of our Party and the greatness of the people's power. From my own lessons, I felt how generous and serious the Party and the people are. The interests of the Party are above all else, and the interests of the people are above all else. I am not allowed to continue to make mistakes. I am determined to thoroughly correct my mistakes and transform my bourgeois and petty bourgeois thinking.

Finally, I request the Party to give me the punishment I deserve to further admonish me! Educate me!

    我在山东文联工作期间的错误
    于寄愚
    编者按：本报于二月十一日、二月二十七日、三月十二日读者来信栏内连续发表四封读者来信，揭发了山东文联某些领导干部的腐朽的资产阶级的思想和严重的官僚主义作风，以及由此所造成的贪污、浪费和压制民主等恶果。其中曾着重地批评了于寄愚在山东文联任副主任期间所犯的错误。现在于寄愚已经作出自我检讨，我们把它发表在这里。这个检讨是不够深刻的，于寄愚还应该更深刻地对自己的非无产阶级的思想作风加以严格批判。
    从一九五○年春到一九五一年春为止，我在负责山东文联筹备会的领导工作中，犯了很多错误。
    反贪污斗争开始后，我只着重检讨了在华东文联筹备工作中（于寄愚现任华东文联秘书长—编者）的铺张浪费的错误，对在山东文联的一段工作并未作认真的检查。二月十一日人民日报读者来信提出批评后，才惊醒了我，在上级的教育和同志们的帮助下，才进一步认识到过去一段工作中的错误的严重性。根据我现在的认识，在山东文联的工作中，我犯了以下几种严重的错误。
    一、严重的自以为是、个人的权威思想、政治上自由主义，造成了当时山东文艺工作的重大损失。
    首先，我根本忽视了文艺工作的思想领导的重要性，一年来从未认真组织过对毛主席文艺思想的学习，也从未注意进行文艺批评工作。因而当时山东文艺思想是混乱的，我个人的文艺思想首先是混乱的。
    关于如何组织创作的问题，我因坚持自己主观主义的看法，认为省市以下的各级文工团、队皆应归文联领导，使文工团既是组织文艺创作的主力，又是推动文艺活动的主力。对于组织作家下乡下厂，参加群众运动，取得锻炼，从事创作，我不仅不提倡，反而在思想上、工作上都加以拒绝和限制。我只同意个别从过去蒋管区来的作家可以下乡、下厂，求得改造；机关干部短时期轮流下去，觉得也还可以考虑；对几个负领导责任的同志，我就坚决反对他们下去。认为他们是从个人名利出发，从逃避领导责任出发的。我曾经写了一篇论文艺干部思想改造的论文，批评这种思想，因编辑部不同意，未发表；但在其他论文中我还是部分地表现了这种错误的看法。
    我在和这一个问题有关的问题上，又犯了组织性纪律性不强的错误。一九五○年春天，山东取消了文工团，大部分文工团员集中起来学习，我听到华东大学一度有南下消息时，就蛮横地要求领导方面，将华东大学的艺术系留在山东。领导方面是从整体利益出发解决问题的，当然不允许。我心中愤懑，联名写信，越级向领导方面提意见。并在下级干部面前发牢骚，认为山东的文艺工作没有办法干下去了。在这以前，我常常用蛮横的官僚主义态度对待下级，在此以后，我又是政治上的自由主义。一九五○年秋，地委一级的文工团又准备成立，规定由省人民政府文教厅领导，我却要求由文联领导。因事情不可能如己愿，我又一再狂妄地要求兼作文教厅的一部分工作。认为只有我来领导，才能把文工团搞好。这暴露了我的严重的权威思想。领导方面曾对我进行教育，我口头接受，内心不服。在工作上采取了更严重的自由主义态度，对工作是消极怠工。
    一九五○年春，在山东省文教厅领导下，成立了“山东剧院”，从事戏剧改革的实验工作。由我和文联另外的几位同志负责该院的实际领导工作。在文联工作方针上，虽然规定要以发扬新文艺为主，在戏剧改革工作中也要以改造地方戏曲创作新的戏曲为主；但由于自己偏爱京剧，便以绝大部分力量来大搞特搞。从编戏、导演，到找演员等等都一手包办，使戏剧改革方面的同志无法插手。而对于地方戏的改革，则完全放弃不管。由于从个人兴趣出发，偏爱京戏的结果，就造成了忽视对新文艺的领导。
    “山东文艺”自出版以来，我从未认真加以领导。文艺作品很少审查，只潦草地看很少几篇论文，几乎等于不审查。一九五○年山东省文艺创作评奖，我是山东文艺创作评奖委员会的副主任委员，只简单地看了几本已经初评后的主要作品，其他不看。结果评奖工作做得十分潦草，加上自己认识上的错误，还推荐了内容有错误的作品。
    二、严重的铺张浪费，家长式的领导和腐朽的生活作风。
    我在山东文联期间，文联有一个“大观影剧院”，除了有时演话剧外，还放映电影。当时以盈利的百分之四十作为招待费，因此有了铺张浪费的条件。其中最突出的是招待吃饭，请客看戏。凡外埠来的文艺工作者，京剧主要演员，以至干部外调，干部来省开会等，几无不请客，浪费了约二、三千万元。尤其有几次，并无任何藉口，几个领导干部到饭馆吃饭，竟由公家报销。请客看戏也毫无标准，凡是和我个人熟悉的，皆可列入被请之列。除此之外，还在文联机关内花了四十余万元，修了一个养鱼池子，浪费了国家不少财产。
    由于有了机关生产在手，给个人也就开了方便之门，公私不分，任意挥霍。平日，来了自己的亲属、老朋友，则随意告诉伙房添菜，有几次则到饭馆叫菜，或到饭馆吃饭，由公家报销。抽烟吃茶，随时写条子向管理人员要。彷佛文联已成了我个人的私产。即使如此，仍不能满足个人的浪费需要，还多次向别人乱借钱，乱要东西。
    由于严重的铺张浪费，造成了当时文联财政制度的严重混乱和贪污现象的发生。也正因为我的铺张浪费和官僚主义，故对贪污现象熟视无睹。例如：一九五○年春天，有人密告文联秘书周终愉有贪污行为，但因密告者冒称“大观影剧院全体职工”的名义，检举信中又无具体贪污材料，所以未追究贪污问题，反而错误地向另一方面怀疑，肯定匿名者最大可能是挟嫌报复，于是便追查密告者。当时虽然也对别人的密告布置了一下检查和清理账目的工作，但这只是检查和整理了一下一般账目手续，对贪污问题并未追究。又如一九五○年秋天，初步发现文联的仓库及当时省立剧院的物资，有被偷窃现象，但也只检查了一下该院的账目，除了追取二两鸦片（原京剧团物资内存放的）交给了卫生所外，对于其他一些偷窃问题也未认真追究。这是何等严重的错误！
    所以造成以上铺张浪费等错误的原因，主要由于我个人入城以后，严重地受了资产阶级思想的侵蚀，首先学习了资产阶级一套庸俗的请客作风，错误地把它看成是文艺统一战线工作的重要方式，进一步发展到吃吃喝喝和个人享受。加之，在我身上还残存着剥削阶级的思想作风，进城以后，遇到了资产阶级思想的侵袭，这种思想作风就迅速地发展起来了。
    在对机关日常工作的领导中，我存在着严重的家长作风。文联机关自成立以来，从无一次正式拟定工作计划，也从无正式的会议制度。有时就找几个部门负责人在一起研究一下，抓一点，作一点，或则有布置无检查。各种问题，个人说了就算，对干部思想情况以及生活情况很少关心。在分配任务时，采用命令主义，很少注意对干部进行教育。我除了每日东跑西跑，很多时间是忙于参加各种会议，或送往迎来，对机关工作很少过问。机关学习我很少参加；党的文件很少阅读。
    这样，自己就在一年之间变成了一个“自由王国”内的“小皇帝”，高高在上，养尊处优，严重地脱离了群众，使工作遭到不可补偿的损失。若不是当时党对我的挽救，并及时将我调动工作，已很难想像得出我今天会堕落到什么程度了。
    三、文艺创作思想上的混乱，缺乏严肃的自我批评。
    我到山东文联工作以前，很少写过文艺作品。在山东文联工作期间，也不过写了两三篇杂文，一两首诗，改了一个京剧本。现就两件事情来检查我的文艺创作思想的混乱和错误的严重程度。
    一九五○年冬天，我曾写了一篇杂文“说猫”，登在“山东文艺”上。这短短的一篇杂文中有许多严重的错误：用“猫与老鼠的关系”比喻“旧日里地主与农民的关系”，并说了“假若有人要我一定在希特勒与杜鲁门之间宽恕一个恶人的话，我倒宁愿宽恕希特勒，虽然一个也不饶”这样错误的话。此文发表之后，“文艺报”上即有读者提出了批评。当时我只认为是比喻用得不恰当，并没有什么原则性的错误，即未准备作检讨。后来“文艺报”上提出批评，但我又认为那个批评在说法上有些夸大，于是产生了思想上的抵抗。今天检讨起来，我的杂文是有严重错误的。不管是把旧日的农民或现在的农民比作老鼠，很显然是对农民阶级的侮辱。这完全失掉了阶级立场的。关于对希特勒的讲法也更是失掉立场的。
    其次，上海崑崙公司到山东拍制“武训传”影片时，我在山东省文教厅召开的座谈会上是主要发言人。我发表了异常荒谬的意见。以今天记忆所及，我的意见大体是：“武训的行为是不足取的，其效果是坏的；但武训本人是好的，动机是良善的。”因而提出了要对武训写得“虽不应当歌颂他，也不应讽刺他”，“虽要揭发他行为的错误，又要说明他动机的良善”等，这种似乎莫名其妙的，毫无立场的，而其实是小资产阶级、资产阶级的错误意见。当时并且煞费苦心地提了许多具体修改意见。例如要把武训写成带有两面性格或双重人格的人物；对武训的处理上，应当使他步步看到自己的失败和错误而最后自杀死掉。这样既能说明他的行为是错误的，也更便于说明他的动机是良善的等。在这一问题上，我不但尽了最大歪曲历史事实的能事，而且作了恶劣的宣传资产阶级反动思想的积极赞助人。
    所以犯了以上的错误，是由于自己的文艺思想异常混乱。我虽然经过了多年革命斗争的锻炼，但思想上并未得到彻底改造。在自己的灵魂的深处，仍然盘据着浓厚的小资产阶级以至资产阶级的思想感情的根芽。一有机会，就暴露了出来。
    在“武训传”的讨论展开后，山东领导方面曾令我好好检讨一下，我却轻描淡写地写了一大篇论文，但很少批判自己。文章未发表，我就参加老区访问工作去了。回来后，又很快调离山东。此时对“武训传”的错误已有严正的结论，各地讨论也已大体告一段落，我也就马虎过去，不准备再检讨了。来华东文联后，又连续看到对我的杂文“说猫”的批评，领导方面也一再督促我要作检讨，我也轻描淡写地写了一篇，但解释多于自我批评。领导方面也未同意发表，我也准备马马虎虎过去算了。自己认为检讨官僚主义的领导作风，倒还没有什么，觉得这是工作上难免的；检讨生活作风也不大在乎，因为这是生活小节；但要检查自己创作思想上的错误，则颇有些痛。这不仅由于自己的认识上的错误，对自己官僚主义的领导作风及生活作风等项错误的危害和严重性认识不够，更由于自己存在着严重的个人主义思想，患得患失，缺乏严肃的自我批评的精神，觉得作为一个文艺工作的领导干部，偏偏在文艺创作思想上犯了错误，很有些抬不起头来。这种错误思想不仅严重地阻碍着自己及时纠正文艺思想上的错误，而且也正是过去长期在领导工作上不断犯错误，因循苟且，不能及时纠正的主要原因。
    四、党的利益高于一切，人民的利益高于一切，不容许我再错误下去。
    经过这次伟大的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，自己的思想觉悟也就逐渐提高起来，对过去的错误也逐渐认识了它的严重性。过去的松懈麻痹、满不在乎的心绪也逐渐变为沉重。开始在华东文联全体干部大会上，作了初步检讨。但对报纸上前后两次读者来信中的批评，开始时仍然存在着某些抵抗情绪，认为其中某些情况和说法有些夸大，总想到一些辩护自己的理由；而不是完全无保留地严格地检查自己。其实同志们的批评只有不足，何尝过分？这只说明了自己还是多方原谅和姑息自己。
    在上级教育、同志们的帮助下，自己经过了更严肃的激烈的思想斗争后，才认识了由于自己的错误思想作风所造成的恶果，这一切都应由自己负责，而不能推之于客观。我到华东文联之后，虽然上级一再警告，不是仍然造成许多铺张浪费的错误吗？这完全证明自己在思想作风上有严重的错误而不自觉，而且是早已走进了堕落的陷坑而不知自拔！
    在反贪污斗争中，我才真正觉悟到我是在危险中被挽救了出来。我真正进一步认识到我们党的伟大，人民力量的伟大。从我自己的教训中感到党和人民是如何宽厚而又严肃。党的利益高于一切，人民的利益高于一切，不允许我再错误下去。我决心彻底改正我的错误，改造我的资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想。
    最后，请求党给我以应得的处分，以进一步地告诫我！教育我！
