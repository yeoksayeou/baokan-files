Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 12th: A reporter from this agency on the Korean front commented on the current situation on the Korean battlefield, saying: The current temporary lull in ground warfare on the Korean battlefield does not indicate that the U.S. aggressors have abandoned their policy of military adventure. On the contrary, the U.S. aggressors are intensifying their criminal activities of continuing and expanding the war of aggression.

As everyone knows, since the U.S. aggressors were forced to reach an agreement with our side on the military demarcation line issue last November, they have been insisting on various absurd and unreasonable demands to delay the armistice negotiations and hinder the agreement on the third and fourth agenda items; they have even resorted to despicable tricks such as re-bombing the neutral zone to obstruct and sabotage the negotiations. On the battlefront, after suffering heavy losses in several key offensives, the U.S. aggressor army has been forced to change to using small units to launch frequent attacks and raids against us, but it constantly carries out frantic and blind artillery bombardments on our positions, attempting to use this method to maintain a "tense situation" on the Korean battlefield, so as to facilitate its new conspiracies, and to exhaust and disturb our army, and destroy our front-line positions. But the U.S. aggressor army's trickery, like its key offensives, has suffered a miserable defeat. Of the hundreds of small-scale offensives launched by the enemy against our front-line positions, not one has failed to be repelled with heavy casualties under our strict fire. In total, since November of last year to February of this year, in the four months, the enemy's personnel casualties were over 60,000. The heroic Korean-Chinese People's Army, in the continuous battles against enemy incursions, has not only not been weakened, but has become more and more vigorous in battle, greatly consolidated its own positions, and has transformed countless desolate mountains into impregnable fortresses. This situation, which is unfavorable to the enemy's military adventures, has forced General Joye, who not long ago was clamoring about "using military pressure," to publicly admit that the aggressor army's "military superiority has been lost."

Although the U.S. aggressors feel frustrated by their irreparable defeat on the Korean battlefield, they are not reconciled to abandoning further and greater military adventures, and they are still frantically carrying out various criminal conspiracies. In particular, starting from January 28th, the U.S. aggressors, ignoring the public outrage of the people of the world, have been continuously spreading large numbers of germ-carrying insects by plane on the Korean front and in the rear. Even after the Korean Foreign Minister Park Heon-yeong issued a statement to the world condemning this, and our country's Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai issued a statement supporting Park Heon-yeong, the U.S. aggressors not only did not withdraw their evil bloodstained hands, but recklessly sent military aircraft to intrude into the airspace over Antung and Fushun in Northeast China, spreading large numbers of bacteria-carrying insects; at the same time, they indiscriminately bombed and strafed our people. All this proves that the U.S. aggressors are deliberately expanding the war of aggression, and are attempting to turn northern Korea into an area rampant with epidemics, poisoning the Chinese and Korean People's Armies and the Korean people who are defending peace in the East and the world, in order to weaken our strength, disrupt our army's rear, and carry out threats and intimidation to prepare conditions for new military adventures. However, there is no weapon in the world that cannot be defended against, including bacteriological weapons. Bacteriological weapons did not save Japanese and German fascism from their doom, and of course, they will never save the U.S. aggressors from their final defeat.

It must be pointed out that the U.S. aggressors are insidious, vicious, and cunning. The Chinese and Korean People's Armies and the Chinese and Korean people should heighten their vigilance against this deadly enemy of the Chinese-Korean people and the people of the world. The commanders and fighters of the Korean-Chinese troops are now clenching their iron fists, ready at any time to strike more heavily at the enemy who dares to carry out new military adventures. At present, the whole of Korea has been mobilized and投入to the struggle against the U.S. military's bacteriological warfare. The Chinese people are fully supporting the Chinese and Korean People's Armies and the Korean people; the people's democratic countries and the just people of the world are also unanimously condemning this heinous crime of the U.S. aggressors. With the support of such a strong backing, the heroic and invincible Chinese and Korean People's Armies confidently and firmly state: We can defeat the enemy's "air and sea superiority," and we will certainly be able to defeat the enemy's bacteriological warfare!

    新华社记者评述朝鲜战场目前的战况
    我军愈战愈强正准备随时打击敌人新的军事冒险
    美国侵略者使用细菌武器决不能挽救它的最后失败
    【新华社朝鲜前线十二日电】本社前线记者评述朝鲜战场目前的战况称：目前朝鲜战场地面战事暂时的沉寂现象，并不是表示美国侵略者已经放弃了他的军事冒险政策；恰恰相反，美国侵略者正在变本加厉地进行继续并扩大侵略战争的罪恶活动。
    大家都知道，美国侵略者自去年十一月在军事分界线问题上被迫与我方达成协议以后，到现在是一直在坚持种种荒谬无理的要求，来拖延停战谈判，阻挠第三、第四两项议程达成协议；甚至不惜重新使用轰炸中立区等卑劣伎俩，来阻挠和破坏谈判。在战线上，美国侵略军在几次重点进攻中遭到惨重损失以后，除了已被迫地改变为用小股兵力向我进行频繁的进攻和窜扰之外，却经常地对我阵地进行疯狂的盲目的炮击，企图用这种办法来保持朝鲜战场的“紧张状态”，便于其进行新的阴谋活动；并疲惫与扰乱我军，摧毁我前线阵地。但是美国侵略军的这种鬼计和他的重点进攻一样遭到了惨败。敌人向我前线阵地发动的数百次小股进攻，没有一次不是在我严密火力痛击下伤亡众多后败退。总计自去年十一月至今年二月的四个月以来，敌军兵员被我杀伤六万余人。英勇的朝中人民军队在不断打击敌人进犯的战斗中，不仅没有被削弱，反而愈战愈强，大大巩固了自己的阵地，并已将无数荒凉的山岭改造成不可侵犯的坚强堡垒。这种对敌人进行军事冒险不利的情况，使得在不久以前还大叫“使用军事压力”的乔埃也不得不公开承认：侵略军的
    “军事优势已经丧失”。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上遭到不可挽救的惨败后，对其军事进攻虽然感到沮丧，但并不甘心放弃在军事上作继续的更大的冒险，他们仍疯狂地进行着各种罪恶的阴谋活动。特别是从一月二十八日开始，美国侵略者竟不顾世界人民的公愤，用飞机在朝鲜前线和后方不断撒布大量带有病菌的昆虫。甚至在朝鲜朴宪永外务相向全世界发表控诉声明和我国周恩来外交部长发表支持朴外相的声明以后，美国侵略者不仅没有收回其罪恶的血手，更不顾一切地在最近派军用飞机侵入我国东北安东、抚顺等地上空，撒布大量传播细菌的昆虫；同时滥施轰炸、扫射我国人民。这一切都证明美国侵略者蓄意扩大侵略战争，并妄图把朝鲜北部造成一个疫疠横行的区域，毒杀保卫着东方与世界和平的中朝人民军队和朝鲜人民，以削弱我方力量，破坏我军后方；进行威胁、恫吓为新的军事冒险准备条件。但是，世界上没有任何不能防御的武器，包括细菌武器在内，细菌武器既没有挽救日本和德国法西斯覆灭的厄运，当然也决不能挽救美国侵略者的最后失败。
    必须指出：美国侵略者是阴险毒辣的，诡计多端的，中朝人民军队和中朝人民应该提高对这中朝人民和世界人民的死敌的警惕。朝中部队的指挥员战斗员现正握紧铁拳，随时准备更沉重地打击敢于进行新的军事冒险的敌人。目前全朝鲜已动员起来，投入到反对美军进行细菌战的斗争。中国人民正以全力支援中朝人民军队和朝鲜人民；各人民民主国家和世界正义人民也一致声讨美国侵略者这种令人发指的滔天罪行。英勇无敌的中朝人民军队在这样强大后盾的支持下满怀信心地坚决表示：我们能够打败敌人的“海空优势”，我们也一定能够打败敌人的细菌战！
