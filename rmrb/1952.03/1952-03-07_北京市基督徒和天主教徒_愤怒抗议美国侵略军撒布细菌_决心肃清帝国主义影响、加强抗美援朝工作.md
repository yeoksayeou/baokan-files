    [Report from our newspaper] Christian churches and organizations in Beijing, and the Beijing Catholic Reformation Committee, representing Christians and Catholics in the city respectively, have issued statements protesting the heinous crime of the U.S. aggressor army waging bacteriological warfare in Korea.
    The Christian churches and organizations in Beijing, including the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Church of Christ in China, the Anglican Church of China, the Congregational Church, the Salvation Army, the Chinese Holiness Church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Assemblies of God, the True Jesus Church, the Holy City New Church, the Christian Assembly Place, the YMCA and YWCA, jointly issued a statement saying: "This inhuman and brutal act of U.S. imperialism, which violates human justice and international law, has aroused our infinite anger and hatred, contempt, and disdain for it. We Christians in Beijing unanimously lodge a serious protest against U.S. imperialism. We will work with the people of the whole country to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, enhance our patriotic awareness, eliminate the 'ideological bacteria' spread in our minds by U.S. imperialism through missionary activities over the years, and more actively promote the church's self-reliance and reform movement to smash all the evil conspiracies of the American aggressors.
    We believe that kind Christians in the United States and around the world should no longer sit idly by and ignore the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism. Any Christian who is willing to uphold justice and humanity cannot tolerate the U.S. reactionary government's use of bacteriological weapons to massacre peaceful people in Korea and the Chinese and Korean People's Forces on a large scale. We especially want to appeal loudly to Christians in the United States: Can you tolerate your reactionary government carrying out bloody massacres in your name? If you believe in justice, peace, and humanity, you should immediately take action and stand with the peace-loving people of the world to resolutely stop the U.S. imperialist war of aggression and all its crimes."
    The statement from the Beijing Catholic Reformation Committee said: "We clearly know that the crimes committed by the American beasts in Korea are not only a frenzied massacre of peaceful residents of Korea and the Chinese and Korean People's Armed Forces, but also a major threat to world peace and the safety of all mankind. The iron facts once again prove that the American aggressors are the most dangerous enemies of world peace and human justice. This completely inhuman behavior is intolerable to every peace-loving and just person in the world.
    On behalf of the more than 30,000 Catholics in Beijing, we lodge a serious protest with unparalleled anger against the U.S. aggressors' heinous crime of genocide. We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement and respond to the call of Chairman Guo Moruo of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, mobilize all Catholics to actively participate in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, continue to do a good job in the self-reliance and reform movement, eliminate imperialist elements and imperialist influence within the church with practical actions, support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, finally defeat the American aggressors, and give the most severe punishment to the American and Japanese bacteriological war criminals.
    Patriotic Catholics throughout the city! Human justice and morality are suffering unprecedented and barbaric destruction. Can we tolerate it? No, we must not tolerate it. We should mobilize ourselves and, together with the people of the whole country, contribute all our strength to the cause of upholding world peace and justice and human morality."

    愤怒抗议美国侵略军撒布细菌
    决心肃清帝国主义影响、加强抗美援朝工作
    【本报讯】北京市基督教各教会、团体和北京市天主教革新委员会，分别代表全市基督徒和天主教徒发表声明，抗议美国侵略军在朝鲜进行细菌战争的滔天罪行。
    北京市基督教各教会、团体，包括中华基督教卫理公会、中华基督教会、中华圣公会、公理会、救世军、中华圣洁教会、安息日会、神召会、真耶稣教会、圣城新教会、基督教徒聚会处和基督教青年会、基督教女青年会联合发表声明称：美帝国主义这种违反人类正义和国际公法的灭绝人性的残暴行为，引起我们的无限愤怒和对它的仇视、鄙视和蔑视。我们北京市的基督徒一致对美帝国主义提出严重抗议。我们要和全国人民一起加强抗美援朝工作，提高我们的爱国主义认识，肃清美帝国主义多年来利用传教活动撒布在我们头脑中的“思想毒菌”，更积极地推进教会自立革新运动，粉碎美国侵略者的一切罪恶阴谋。
    我们认为美国以及全世界的善良基督徒们，再不应对美帝国主义的侵略罪行坐视不理了。凡是愿意维护正义和人道的基督徒，就决不能容忍美国反动政府使用细菌武器大规模屠杀朝鲜和平人民和中朝人民部队的罪行。我们特别要向美国的基督徒们大声疾呼，难道你们竟能容忍你们的反动政府假借你们的名义来进行血腥的屠杀吗？假若你们相信正义、和平与人道，你们就应该立即行动起来，和全世界爱好和平的人民站在一起，坚决制止美帝国主义的侵略战争和它的一切罪行。
    北京市天主教革新委员会的声明称：我们清楚地知道：美国野兽们在朝鲜犯下的罪行，不单是对朝鲜和平居民和中朝人民武装的疯狂虐杀，它并且是对全世界和平和全人类安全的重大威胁。铁的事实再一次证明美国侵略者是世界和平和人类正义最危险的敌人。这种完全丧失人性的行为是全世界爱好和平和正义的每一个人民所不能容忍的。
    我们代表北京市三万多天主教徒，以无比的愤怒严重抗议美国侵略者这种灭绝人性的滔天罪行。坚决拥护周恩来外长的庄严声明和响应中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会郭沫若主席的号召，动员全体教友积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争，以继续搞好自立革新运动、肃清教内的帝国主义分子和帝国主义影响的实际行动，支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，最后战胜美国侵略者，对美日细菌战犯给予最严厉的惩罚。
    全市的爱国教友们！人类的正义、道德正遭受着空前野蛮的破坏。我们能容忍吗？不，决不能容忍。我们应当动员起来和全国人民一道，为维护世界和平正义、人类道德，贡献出我们自己的一切力量。
