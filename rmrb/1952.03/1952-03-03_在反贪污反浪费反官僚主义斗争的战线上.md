    The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang Calls on the Entire Party to Strengthen the Fight Against Corruption
    The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued an instruction to all levels of organizations on February 29th, calling for strengthening the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and resolutely repelling the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks. The instruction first requires all levels of organizations to conduct a comprehensive review of the situation in the previous stage of the movement. Starting with ideological examination, find all shortcomings, deviations, and errors. Correct immediately all kinds of erroneous thoughts that more or less exist, such as "Democratic parties are clean government departments," "The struggle of democratic parties should be moderate," and various forms of relaxation and complacency. It is necessary to organize special personnel to conduct in-depth investigations of special cases, relentlessly pursue corrupt elements, and be sure to squeeze out all corrupt elements, large and small. Those with unclean hands are absolutely not allowed to participate in the inspection agencies until they have clearly explained the problems. If members of the Economy Inspection Committee are found to have unclean hands or are passively slacking off, their positions should be revoked; if leading cadres are incorrigible, they should be ordered to make public self-criticisms and be severely criticized, and in serious cases, they should be suspended from their duties to reflect. Anyone who dares to sabotage or resist the movement should be resolutely purged from the party.
    The instruction also requires close integration of the anti-corruption struggle within the party with the anti-bribery struggle of the broad masses of the people. All levels of organizations should immediately mobilize party members and cadres in a planned and step-by-step manner to actively participate in the anti-bribery struggle.
    The instruction emphasizes that it is necessary to fully recognize that this movement is a class struggle to repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship; on the other hand, it is also the rectification movement uniformly carried out by all democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic people from all walks of life this year. The entire party must, through this movement, ideologically, politically, and organizationally move further closer to the working class, and lay a solid foundation for the party's future ideological remolding movement. Organizations that have achieved certain results in the anti-corruption struggle should, after being approved by the Central Committee of the party, shift the focus of the movement to ideological examination. Ideological examination should adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism, starting with examining the party's political line, organizational line, various policies, resolutions, and documents, and closely combining personal thoughts, understanding, and work style to criticize all non-proletarian thoughts, mainly launching an irreconcilable struggle against the fundamentally reactionary bourgeois thoughts that seriously hinder our progress.
    Workers and Shop Assistants in Guangzhou and Changsha Respond to Tianjin Shop Assistants' Challenge to Expose Large and Small Profiteers
    Workers and shop assistants in Guangzhou and Changsha responded to the challenge from shop assistants in Tianjin, deciding to thoroughly expose illegal industrial and commercial households. The Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting of workers' and shop assistants' representatives on February 22nd. The meeting decided to further mobilize workers and shop assistants throughout the city to actively participate in the anti-bribery struggle, and decided to respond to the challenge from Tianjin shop assistants. Ye Jianying, the Mayor of Guangzhou Municipal People's Government, spoke at the meeting, and he resolutely guaranteed on behalf of the government to support the workers. He pointed out that the time has come to fully launch an attack on illegal industrial and commercial households, and he called on workers and shop assistants to further rise up to struggle. More than 4,000 representatives attending the meeting unanimously passed the motion to respond to the challenge from Tianjin shop assistants. They proposed: 50,000 shop assistants throughout the city unite as one, concentrate their firepower, and encircle and suppress illegal industrialists and businessmen, ensuring that not a single one escapes.
    More than 4,000 members of the shock teams of workers and shop assistants from private enterprises in Changsha held a swearing-in meeting on February 21st, responding to the challenge from Tianjin shop assistants. Workers and shop assistants from private enterprises in Changsha have reported more than 30,000 cases of illegal merchants stealing crimes; more than 100 thieves who stole more than 100 million yuan have been arrested. At the meeting, workers and shop assistants swore to capture all the large and small profiteers in the city who steal state property. They passed the shock team's discipline of strictly guarding secrets, not speaking about personal feelings, obeying unified leadership, and not leaving the team casually.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的战线上
    民革中央节约检查委员会号召全党加强反贪污斗争
    中国国民党革命委员会中央节约检查委员会，在二月二十九日向各级组织发出指示，号召加强反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，坚决反击资产阶级猖狂进攻。指示首先要求各级组织对于运动前一阶段的情况进行一次全面的检查。从检查思想入手，找出所有的缺点、偏差和错误。对或多或少地存在着“民主党派清水衙门”、“民主党派的斗争要适可而止”和松懈自满各式各样的错误思想，应立即予以纠正。必须组织专人深入检查专案，穷追猛打贪污分子，务必把大小贪污挤个干净。手上不干净的，在未把问题交代清楚以前，绝对不容许参加检查机构。如节约检查委员会中发现有手上不干净或消极怠工的分子，即应撤销其职务；领导干部如执迷不悟者，亦应令其当众检讨并严予批判，情况严重者令其停职反省。任何人敢于破坏或抗拒运动，应即坚决把他清除出党。
    指示并要求把党内的反贪污斗争和广大人民的反行贿斗争密切结合起来。各级组织应即有计划有步骤地动员党员干部积极参加反行贿斗争。
    指示着重指出：必须充分认识这一运动是打退资产阶级猖狂进攻，巩固人民民主专政的阶级斗争；另一方面也就是各民主党派、各人民团体、各界民主人士今年所一致进行的整风运动。全党要通过这一运动，在思想上、政治上、组织上更进一步地靠近工人阶级，并为党内今后的思想改造运动打下一个结实的基础。在反贪污斗争取得一定的成绩的组织，经过本党中央核准以后，要将运动的重点转向思想检查。思想检查应采取批评与自我批评的方法，从检查党的政治路线、组织路线、各种政策、决议、文件入手，并密切结合个人思想、认识、作风，批判一切非无产阶级的思想，主要的是向严重阻碍我们前进的、本质上反动的资产阶级思想展开不调和的斗争。
