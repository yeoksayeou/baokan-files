Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: TASS Moscow, 16th: The Soviet people are enthusiastically responding to the statements by the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China protesting the use of bacteriological weapons by American aggressors in Korea and Northeast China.

Moscow factories, institutions, and universities have held mass rallies to protest the crimes of American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. The Soviet people express their boundless indignation at this barbaric act by the American imperialists and demand an immediate end to the manufacture and use of these weapons of mass destruction of humanity.

Several thousand workers at the Stalin Automobile Factory held a rally. Comrade Obalin, a member of the Soviet Peace Committee and a renowned biologist, spoke at the meeting. He said: All mankind is filled with extreme indignation upon learning of the new crimes of the American interventionists in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. Scientists in all countries concentrate their work—the efforts of human genius—on the noble task of eliminating disease. However, the death merchants of the imperialist camp have stolen the fruits of scientists' work and used them to exterminate people. This is an unprecedentedly serious crime in history. Can upright people turn a blind eye to these things? War criminals must receive the punishment they deserve.

Workers, engineers, and technicians spoke out one after another, expressing their anger. A female worker from the woodworking department, Koleneva, said: We Soviet people cherish the interests of world peace. The people of the world will never forgive the crimes of the American imperialists; the whole world hates their crimes. Assonov, the head of metallurgical work at the factory, said: The American devils intend to scare the people with their actions, but they have miscalculated. Their actions have not caused fear, but only hatred and contempt. We firmly believe that the World Peace Council will be able to take all necessary measures to end this unprecedented bacteriological warfare.

The First Ball Bearing Factory also held an angry protest rally. Engineer Chasovnikov said: Truman and Acheson threw lice and other parasitic insects carrying plague, cholera, and typhoid germs into the peaceful towns of Korea and Northeast China, trying to destroy innocent women, children, and the elderly, and to intimidate the peace-loving people of Korea and China. They have violated all international agreements and conventions and trampled on the declarations of the World Peace Congress. We are very angry at these barbaric actions of the American aggressors and their new crimes in Korea and China. We demand that these enemies of mankind be severely punished.

The "Warrior" Machine Factory held a mass rally. A Stakhanovite worker, Makarov, said in his speech: The American army has been battered and bloodied before the invincible will of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. These Americans, enraged by their military failures, decided to try this last resort—to destroy the people with plague-ridden flies and fleas. There has never been such a terrible crime in human history. The rulers who directed this barbaric act make people despise and hate them. Participants in the rally declared: We join all upright people in expressing our angry protests. We demand the punishment of the organizers of bacteriological warfare.

Participants in other rallies in Moscow also expressed their solidarity with all peace-loving nations protesting the towering crimes of the American aggressors. Comrade Rossiysky, a member of the Soviet Peace Committee and foreman of the "Kaliber" Factory, said: In the Soviet Union, the government rewards scientists who make valuable contributions to the fight against epidemics and the elimination of disease, but the American aggressors keep their "scientists" to manufacture deadly bacteriological weapons. We demand that the American warmongers who threw deadly bacteria into Korean and Chinese towns be severely punished.

Professors, lecturers, and students of Moscow University held a rally to condemn the American aggressors. The President of Moscow University, Academician Petrovsky, delivered a speech at the meeting, denouncing the "scientists" who helped the American imperialists commit heinous crimes in Korea and China. Professor Kozhevnikov of international law spoke about the responsibility of the American imperialists for trampling on all international law and for the crimes they are committing on the territory of Korea and China under the guise of the United Nations flag. He concluded by saying that the people of the world will surely find the strength to restrain the criminal hand that threatens the world with bacteriological warfare.

At various large and small gatherings, resolutions were passed in which the Soviet people firmly protested the use of bacteriological weapons and demanded that the World Peace Council take all necessary measures to save mankind from the danger of bacteriological warfare.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th: TASS Moscow, 15th: The Soviet people warmly support the statements of the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Pak Hon-yong, and the Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, regarding the towering crimes of the American imperialists in using bacteriological weapons against the Korean and Chinese people.

The Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union, Vasily Kholodkov, said in an interview with TASS reporters: From the statement of Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong, it can be seen that the crimes of the American aggressors are not accidental, but a predetermined and bloody plan that has been consistently implemented. Even the atrocities of the German fascist bandits pale in comparison to the actions of their American friends. Such actions are incompatible with the honor and conscience of the people of all countries, and I, like millions of men and women, protest these actions.

Moscow lathe operator Drozhdov, who recently received the Stalin Prize, said: I feel great anger when I hear about this unprecedented crime by the American aggressors. I call on all good men and women to redouble their efforts to defend peace and stop the barbaric enemies who are hostile to progress and culture.

The famous Soviet microbiologist and corresponding academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Krasilnikov, told TASS reporters: Bacteriological warfare is the most serious crime. It is prohibited by international law and condemned by all progressive humanity. The use of microorganisms and germs that can cause disease to carry out mass slaughter of people damages human honor and conscience.

Judging from newspaper reports, bacteriological weapons are being manufactured on a large scale in the United States. Preparations for bacteriological warfare began long ago in the United States, and many scientists have been recruited to participate in this criminal activity.

As a Soviet microbiologist, I cannot help but feel pain that science, which should serve humanity, has become a weapon for the American imperialists to slaughter people. I, along with my colleagues, denounce those reactionary elements in the scientific community who, following the dictates of their masters, manufacture deadly bacteriological weapons. They are not worthy of the noble title of scientist, because the purpose of science is to create life, not to destroy it. Science must serve humanity and the happiness of mankind.

I call on my colleagues in all countries to loudly protest the inhuman acts of American imperialism.

The Protest Movement of the People of Poland and Bulgaria Continues to Expand, Demanding that American Butchers Be Arrested and Shown to the Public

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The protest movement of the people of Bulgaria and Poland condemning the U.S. for waging bacteriological warfare continues to surge. According to TASS news, grand rallies and meetings are being held in factories, agricultural labor cooperatives, agencies, and scientific institutions in Bulgaria. At the meetings, the working people are expressing unparalleled anger at the crimes of the American barbarians and firmly demanding that the U.S. immediately stop the bacteriological war in Korea.

The Bulgarian People's Women's Alliance sent a telegram to the UN Secretary-General, stating: We, representing all the women and mothers of Bulgaria, protest with extreme anger against the use of bacteriological weapons by American criminals in the war against the heroic Korean people. The protest telegram stated: Overcoming infectious diseases is a victory for science, and the American barbarians now spreading infectious diseases with the help of technology is the most serious crime against humanity. We demand an end to the atrocities of the American imperialists and that those murderers who waged bacteriological warfare in Korea be tried. The Polish public also condemned with great indignation the crimes of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China. "People's Tribune" emphasized in its headline: The people of the world condemn American criminals who have committed atrocities against all mankind. "Youth Banner" called for "the arrest and public display of the American executioners and disseminators of death." "Labor Voice" said: "All mankind is extremely indignant after learning about the latest barbaric actions of the imperialists. In response to these new crimes against humanity, all those who cherish peace, life, freedom, and the honor of mankind are intensifying their struggle against the aggression of the new aspirants to world hegemony."

The newspapers all published the resolution of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Polish Journalists Association and the Polish Composers Association protesting the American use of bacteriological weapons. The former's resolution stated: Polish journalists are deeply indignant at this monstrous crime, and they, together with the world's public, demand that war criminals be punished.

Indian Public Opinion Denounces the United States for Launching Bacteriological Warfare and Calls on the People to Unite to Fight for Peace in Korea

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th: Indian public opinion is widely condemning the United States for conducting bacteriological warfare. The Calcutta "Liberty" published an editorial on the 12th, accusing the US imperialists of continuing to delay the Korean armistice talks while secretly committing heinous crimes - bacteriological warfare. The editorial pointed out that the heroic struggle of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as the peace movement of hundreds of millions of people around the world, have frustrated the conspiracies of the American warmongers. They still have the power to frustrate these warmongers' new conspiracies and crimes. The editorial called on every democratic organizer, every democratic organization, and every peace-loving Indian in India to "must loudly demand: Stop bacteriological warfare."

The Bombay "Crossroads Weekly" published a summary on the 7th of the statement of Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai supporting the protest of Korean Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong against the US government's bacteriological warfare. On the 14th, the newspaper published an editorial entitled "Challenge to Humanity," condemning the United States for waging bacteriological warfare in Korea and calling on all democratic and peace-loving people in India to strongly protest this barbaric act. The editorial wrote: Everyone with democratic ideas is filled with unparalleled anger. The American aggressors have become the most dangerous enemies of peace and humanity and must be declared war criminals. It is unimaginable that the United Nations should allow the inventions of medicine and science to be used for criminal activities. The United Nations remains silent because it can no longer reflect the will of the people, it has become a tool of the Wall Street gang.

The editorial emphasized: "A massive protest movement is unfolding around the world. Let India also rise up and protest this atrocity against humanity. What is happening in Korea today may happen in Asia or elsewhere in the world tomorrow. The atrocities of cannibals should be stopped now. All democratic groups must express their protests and unite the people to fight for peace in Korea."

Iranian "Bisu Ayandi Newspaper" Published an Editorial Denouncing the Barbaric Actions of American Warmongers

Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 15th: TASS Tehran, 15th: "Bisu Ayandi Newspaper" emphasized in its editorial: The bacteriological war waged by the American imperialists in Korea is a threat to the entire peace-loving human race. The newspaper said: "The barbaric actions of the American warmongers in Korea have practically proved to the world that the standards of international law, even those accepted by their own agencies, are irrelevant to them. They want to commit any beastly and exterminating crimes. These inhuman demons often talk about loving freedom and humanity, but they are actually the deadly enemies of freedom and humanity."

The newspaper pointed out the US's vicious aggressive conspiracy against Iran, saying:

"The American imperialists who are now launching bacteriological warfare have exposed their true colors. We urge our compatriots to pay attention to the conspiracies of these vicious and insidious enemies of mankind and call on all people to step up their efforts to struggle and drive them out of our country."

French and Burmese Women Held Protest Rallies Calling on Women All Over the World to Stop American Bacteriological Warfare

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Women in France and Burma unanimously condemned the American invading army's bacteriological warfare while celebrating International Women's Day on March 8th. The French "Humanité" reported on the 10th: 40,000 French women held a celebration of International Women's Day in Gennevilliers. In her opening speech at the conference, Mrs. Godon demanded that world public opinion oppose the heinous bacteriological warfare carried out by the United States in Korea. The conference issued a statement saying: "We, the 40,000 women and mothers meeting in Gennevilliers, warmly respond to the appeal of Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, to denounce bacteriological warfare in Korea." The statement called on women all over the world to rise up "against this crime, the brutality of which mankind cannot imagine," and to "rise up with all the strength produced by the hatred we hold in our hearts for cannibals." The statement also called on women to petition the United Nations and the US and French governments to demand an end to this monstrous crime by the US.

When the Burmese Women's Liberation Association and women representatives from all walks of life gathered in Yangon to commemorate "March 8th," they unanimously demanded an end to the aggressive war waged by US imperialism. The chairman of the conference, Daw Htin Chit, denounced the American invading army's use of bacteriological weapons in Korea, which is more brutal than the war criminals of World War II. She also called on Burmese women to mobilize their husbands and sons to stop the American war conspiracy.

    全世界人民展开声势浩大的抗议运动
    一致要求严厉惩罚美国细菌战犯
    莫斯科工厂机关学校纷纷举行群众大会严斥美帝国主义
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：苏联人民热烈地响应朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相和中华人民共和国外交部长抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器的声明。
    莫斯科各工厂、机关和高等学校纷纷举行群众大会，抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的罪行。苏联人民对美帝国主义者这种野蛮的行动表
    示无比的愤怒，并要求立刻停止这种大规模毁灭人类的武器的制造和使用。
    斯大林汽车工厂好几千工人举行集会，苏联拥护和平委员会委员、著名生物学家奥巴林在会上讲话。他说：全人类知道了美国干涉者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的新罪行，莫不感到极度的愤慨。各国的科学家都把他们的工作——人类天才的努力——集中在消除疾病的崇高任务上。但是，帝国主义阵营的死亡贩子们盗取了科学家工作的成果，利用这些工作成果来消灭人民，这是一个历史上空前的严重罪行。正直的人对于这些事情难道能够熟视无睹吗？战争罪犯必须得到应得的惩罚。
    工人们、工程师们和技术人员们都纷纷发言，表示他们的愤怒。木工部一个女工科列聂瓦说：我们苏维埃人民爱护世界和平的利益。全世界人民永远不能宽恕美帝国主义者的罪行，全世界都憎恨他们的罪行。该厂冶金工作负责人阿松诺夫说：美国恶魔们打算以他们的行动来吓唬人民，可是他们的算盘打错了。他们的行动并没有引起恐惧，而只有引起人民的憎恨和鄙视。我们深信，世界和平理事会
    一定能够采取一切必要的措施，以终止这种史无前例的细菌战。
    第一球轴承制造厂也举行了一个愤怒的抗议集会。工程师查索夫尼可夫说：杜鲁门和艾奇逊把带有鼠疫、霍乱和伤寒病菌的虱子等寄生昆虫投到朝鲜和中国东北的和平市镇，是想毁灭无辜的妇孺老弱，想借以恐吓爱好和平的朝鲜和中国人民。他们破坏了一切国际协议和公约，践踏了世界和平大会的宣言。我们对于美国侵略者的这些野蛮行动、对于他们在朝鲜和中国的新罪行，感到非常愤怒。我们要求严厉惩办这些人类的敌人。
    “战士”机器制造厂举行了群众大会。一位斯达哈诺夫式工人马卡洛夫发言说：美国军队已在英雄的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军不可征服的意志之前打得头破血流。这些美国人因为军事失败而恼羞成怒，便决定试行这最后一着——以带有疫病的苍蝇和跳蚤来毁灭人民。人类历史上从来不曾有过这样恐怖的罪行。指使这种野蛮行为的统治者使人鄙视他们、憎恨他们。参加集会的人声称：我们和一切正直的人同声表示愤怒的抗议。我们要求惩罚细菌战的组织者。
    参加莫斯科其他集会的人也都表示他们声援一切抗议美国侵略者滔天罪行的爱好和平的民族。苏联拥护和平委员会委员、“加利伯”工厂领班长罗西斯基说：在苏联，政府对抗疫病和消除病源做出宝贵贡献的科学家给予褒奖，但是美国侵略者却豢养他们的“科学家”来制造杀人的细菌武器。我们要求把向朝鲜和中国城镇投掷杀人细菌的美国战争制造者严加惩罚。
    莫斯科大学的教授、讲师和学生举行集会，谴责美国侵略者。莫斯科大学校长、科学院院士彼得罗夫斯基在会上发表演说，痛斥帮助美帝国主义者在朝鲜和中国犯下滔天罪行的“科学家”。国际法教授科热夫尼科夫谈到美帝国主义者对践踏一切国际法、和在联合国旗帜的幌子下正在朝鲜和中国领土上犯下的罪行所应负的责任。他在结尾表示世界各国人民定能找到力量钳住以细菌战威胁世界的犯罪的手。
    在各种大小集会上，都通过了决议，苏联人民在这些决议中坚决抗议使用细菌武器，并要求世界和平理事会采取一切必要的措施使人类免遭细菌战的危险。
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：苏联人民热烈支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永和中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来关于美帝国主义者对朝中人民使用细菌武器的滔天罪行的声明。
    苏联红十字会与红新月协会联合会执行委员会主席华西里·霍洛德科夫在接见塔斯社记者时说：从朴宪永外务相的声明中可以看出，美国侵略者的罪行并不是偶然的，而是一个在一贯实行的预定的血腥计划。甚至德国法西斯匪徒的丑行和他们的美国朋友的行动比起来，也相形失色。这种行动与各国人民的荣誉和良心是不能相容的，我和千百万男女
    一样对这种行动表示抗议。
    最近得到斯大林奖金的莫斯科镟工德罗日多夫说：我听到美国侵略者这种空前未有的罪行，感到极大的愤怒。我号召一切善良的男女加倍努力，保卫和平并制止与进步和文化为敌的蛮横的敌人。
    著名的苏联微生物学家、苏联科学院通讯院士克拉西尔尼科诺夫对塔斯社记者说：进行细菌战是最严重的罪行。它遭到国际法的禁止和一切进步人类的谴责。使用能够造成疾病的微生物和毒菌来大规模屠杀人民，损害了人类的荣誉和良知。
    根据报纸消息判断，细菌武器正在美国大规模制造。进行细菌战的准备工作老早就在美国开始了，许多科学家被吸收参加这件罪恶的活动。
    我是苏联的一位微生物学家，想到应该为人类服务的科学竟成为美帝国主义者屠杀人民的武器，我不能不感到痛心。我和我的同行一道指斥那些遵照他们主子的意旨制造致死的细菌武器的科学界的反动分子。他们配不上科学家的崇高称号，因为科学的目的是创造生命，而不是毁灭生命。科学必须为人类、为人类的幸福服务。
    我号召一切国家的同行大声疾呼地抗议美帝国主义的毫无人性的行为。
    保波两国人民抗议运动益趋扩大  纷纷要求把美国刽子手逮捕示众
    【新华社十六日讯】保加利亚和波兰人民斥责美国进行细菌战的抗议运动，继续高涨。据塔斯社消息：保加利亚的各工厂、农业劳动合作社、机关和科学机构纷纷举行盛大的集会和会议，劳动人民在大会上对于美国野蛮人的罪行表示无比的愤怒，并坚决要求美国立即停止朝鲜的细菌战争。

    各报都刊载了波兰新闻工作者协会中央委员会主席团和波兰作曲家协会抗议美国使用细菌武器的决议。前者的决议说：波兰新闻工作者对这种滔天罪行深为愤慨，他们与全世界公众共同要求惩办战争罪犯。

    【新华社新德里十六日电】印度舆论纷纷谴责美国进行细菌战。加尔各答“自由报”十二日发表社论，指责美帝国主义者在继续拖延朝鲜停战谈判的同时，在背地里却干下了穷凶极恶的罪行——细菌战。社论指出：朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的英勇战斗以及世界亿万人民的和平运动，曾经挫败了美国战争贩子的阴谋。他们仍有力量挫败这些战争贩子的新的阴谋和罪行。社论号召印度每一个民主组织者、每一个民主组织和每一个爱好和平的印度人，“必须大声疾呼地要求：制止细菌战”。
    孟买“十字路周报”在七日摘要刊载中国周恩来外长支持朝鲜外务相朴宪永抗议美国政府进行细菌战的声明。十四日，该报发表题为“对人类的挑战”的社论，谴责美国在朝鲜进行细菌战，并号召印度一切民主的爱好和平的人民强烈抗议这种野蛮行为。社论写道：一切具有民主思想的人们都怀着无比的愤怒。美国侵略者已成了和平与人类的最危险的敌人，必须宣布他们为战争罪犯。联合国竟允许利用医学和科学的发明来进行罪恶活动，这简直是不可想像的。联合国保持着沉默，因为它已经再也不能反映人民的意志，它已经成了华尔街匪帮的工具。
    社论强调说：“声势浩大的抗议运动正在全世界展开。让印度也起来抗议这种对人类的暴行吧。今天在朝鲜发生的事，明天就可能在亚洲或全世界的其他地方发生。吃人生番的暴行应该在现在就加以制止了。一切民主团体必须表示它们的抗议，团结人民争取朝鲜和平。”
    伊朗“比苏·阿杨第报”发表社论  痛斥美国战争贩子的野蛮行动
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社德黑兰十五日讯：“比苏·阿杨第报”在社论中着重地说：美帝国主义者在朝鲜进行的细菌战，是对整个爱好和平的人类的威胁。该报说：“美国战争贩子在朝鲜的野蛮行动，已实际向全世界证明：国际法的标准，甚至他们自己的机关所接受的那些国际法标准，对他们也不相干了。他们要干出任何兽性的与灭绝人性的罪行。这些人面兽心的魔鬼们还常常谈什么爱好自由与人道，他们实际是自由与人类的死敌。”
    该报指出美国对伊朗的凶恶的侵略阴谋时说道：
    “现在发动细菌战的美帝国主义者已暴露了他们的真面目，我们促请我国同胞注意这些凶恶阴险的人类的敌人的阴谋，并号召所有的人们加紧努力进行斗争，把他们驱逐出我国。”
    法国缅甸妇女分别举行抗议集会  呼吁全世界妇女制止美国细菌战
    【新华社十六日讯】法国和缅甸的妇女在庆祝“三八”国际妇女节时，一致痛斥美国侵略军进行细菌战。法国“人道报”十日报道：四万名法国妇女在日尼维埃举行庆祝国际妇女节大会。戈登夫人在大会开幕词中要求世界舆论反对美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的令人发指的行为。大会发表声明说：“我们，在日尼维埃开会的四万个妇女和母亲，热烈响应世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里号召声讨在朝鲜进行细菌战的声明。”声明号召全世界的妇女起来“反对这种人类无法想像其残暴程度的罪行”，并“以我们内心对于吃人生番们怀抱的愤恨所产生的全部力量起来反对”。声明并号召妇女们向联合国、美国和法国政府请愿，要求制止美国这种滔天罪行。
