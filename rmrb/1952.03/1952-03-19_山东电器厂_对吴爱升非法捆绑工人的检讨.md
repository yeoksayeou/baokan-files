 Shandong Electrical Factory's
    Self-Criticism Regarding Wu Aisheng's Illegal Binding of Workers

    Editor: The "Reader's Letters" column in the People's Daily on December 27, 1951, published a reader's letter criticizing our factory's security guard, Wu Aisheng, for illegally binding worker Zhao Yuanhao (erroneously printed as Zhao Yuanpei). The content of the letter is entirely correct. We hereby offer the following self-criticism:

    When this incident of illegal binding of workers occurred, the factory was in the midst of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Due to our objective busyness and subjective lack of attention to this matter, we did not handle this issue in a timely manner, creating a very negative impact among the workers. What was particularly erroneous was that we did not further investigate the matter, but only listened to the one-sided report from the security department, and hastily announced this matter at the general meeting of all employees. These are concrete manifestations of bureaucratic work style that do not care about the interests of the workers and are irresponsible in their work. In addition to offering our self-criticism here, we also plan to make a profound self-criticism to all employees during this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. Now, the General Branch Committee of our factory's Party has decided, and with the approval of the Zibo Municipal Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee, to give Wu Aisheng a public warning within the Party and to give Zheng Jianjun, the deputy director of the Personnel Office, an admonishment.

        Former Secretary of the General Branch, Shandong Electrical Factory, East China Industrial Department: Wang Sheng
        Former Factory Director: Liu Mingnan
        Chairman of the Labor Union: Wang Huihua
        Deputy Secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Youth League: Yu Xinsheng

    山东电器厂
    对吴爱升非法捆绑工人的检讨
    编辑同志：一九五一年十二月二十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载了批评我厂保卫员吴爱升非法捆绑工人赵源浩（误刊赵源培）的读者来信，信中所说完全正确。我们特作检讨如下：
    当这件非法捆绑工人的事件发生时，厂内正在进行镇压反革命工作。由于我们在客观上较忙，主观上又对这件事重视不够，就没有及时处理这个问题，在工人中造成很坏的影响。尤其错误的是，我们对问题不作进一步的了解，只听信保卫部门的片面汇报，就轻率地在全体职工大会上宣布了这件事。这些都是不关心工人利益，对工作不负责任的官僚主义作风的具体表现。我们除在这里作检讨外，并拟在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，向全体职工作深刻检讨。现在，我厂党总支委员会已经决定，并经淄博市委纪律检查委员会批准，给予吴爱升以党内当众警告的处分，给予人事室副主任郑健俊以劝告的处分。
