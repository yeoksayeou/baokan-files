    Certain State-Owned Enterprises in Jiangxi Province Should Examine the Erroneous Practice of Employing Profiteers
    Editor: During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, it was discovered that the situation of bourgeois elements infiltrating state-owned enterprises was very serious. According to incomplete statistics, there were 153 such individuals. The Provincial Cooperative Goods Station, Provincial Department Store, Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, Nanchang City Local Cloth and Cotton Weaving Exchange, and China National Pharmaceutical Corporation had the highest numbers.

    These capitalists infiltrated public enterprises in many ways. Some withdrew their capital from their own stores and applied to close down before infiltrating, while others infiltrated while their shops were still open, but none of them went through introductions from the labor bureau's labor exchange.

    As early as October last year, shop assistants in the Nanchang City department store industry raised the issue of departments such as the Nanchang City Local Cloth and Cotton Weaving Exchange and the Provincial Cooperative Goods Station privately employing capitalists without going through introductions from the labor bureau's labor exchange. After investigation by the labor bureau, opinions were submitted to various units, the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau, and the Provincial Department of Commerce, but the Provincial Department of Commerce never responded. In its reply, the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau even attempted to "legalize" the issue of privately employing capitalists without going through the local labor exchange, defending the capitalists' seizure of leadership positions in state-owned enterprises. I suggest that a review be conducted within the national economic departments during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to thoroughly correct this extremely erroneous phenomenon.

### 江西省某些国营企业应检查引用奸商的错误行为

    江西省某些国营企业应检查引用奸商的错误行为
    编辑同志：江西省南昌市在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，发现资产阶级混进国营企业的情况非常严重，据不完全的统计，就有一百五十三名。其中以省合作货栈、省百货公司、省花纱布公司、南昌市土布棉织交易所、中国医药公司等单位为最多。
    这些资本家混进公营企业的方式很多，有的是把自己的商店的资金抽走申请歇业后混进来的，有的是店铺还开着就混进来的，但都没有经过劳动局劳动介绍所的介绍。
    去年十月间，市百货业店员就已提出南昌市土布棉织交易所、省合作货栈等部门，不经过劳动局劳动介绍所介绍，私自雇用资本家的问题，此事经劳动局调查后，曾向各单位及市工商局和省商业厅提出意见，但省商业厅一直没有答复。市工商局在复函中，还企图把不通过当地劳动介绍所即私自雇用资本家的问题“合法化”，替资本家窃取国营企业的领导权作辩护。我建议在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，在国家经济部门中进行一次检查，彻底纠正这种极端错误的现象。
