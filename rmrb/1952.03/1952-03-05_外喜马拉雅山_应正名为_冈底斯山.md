    "Trans-Himalayas" Should Be Renamed "Gangdise Mountains"
    To the Editor: Many geography books continue to use the extremely erroneous name "Trans-Himalayas" for the "Gangdise Mountains" within Tibet. According to the "Provincial Map of the People's Republic of China" (edited by Jin Qingyu et al., re-edited by Yaguang Cartography Society in April 1951), its explanation is: "The Trans-Himalayas traverse the central part of Tibet, and are named so because they are located north of the Himalayas." Obviously, this is still an imperialist viewpoint, and this statement is very harmful. Precisely because the mountain "traverses the central part of Tibet," precisely because the mountain is "located north of the Himalayas," it cannot be called "Trans-Himalayas." The terms "inner" and "outer" here are not to be confused. Therefore, I suggest that relevant departments promptly issue an order to correct this erroneous name and give it an appropriate name.

    Editor's Note: Reader Liu Yinong's opinion is correct. The mountain was originally called "Gangdise Mountains." "Trans-Himalayas" is the name given to it by British imperialists. Now the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government has decided to rename the mountain "Gangdise Mountains."

### “外喜马拉雅山”应正名为“冈底斯山”

    “外喜马拉雅山”应正名为“冈底斯山”
    编辑同志：许多地理书籍对于西藏境内的“冈底斯山”，一直沿用着“外喜马拉雅山”这个极端错误的名称。据“中华人民共和国分省地图”（金擎宇等编、亚光舆地学社一九五一年四月再版）对它的解释是：“外喜马拉雅山横亘西藏中部，因为位在喜马拉雅山以北，故得此名。”很显然，这还是帝国主义者的观点，这种说法是非常有害的。正因为该山“横亘西藏中部”，正因为该山“位在喜马拉雅山以北”，才不能叫作“‘外’喜马拉雅山”。“内”和“外”在这里是决不容含糊的。因此，我建议有关部门迅速明令改正这个错误的名称，而给以适当的命名。

    编者按：读者刘逸浓的意见是正确的。该山原名为“冈底斯山”，“外喜马拉雅山”是英帝国主义者给它取的称号。现在中央人民政府内务部已决定把该山正名为“冈底斯山”。
