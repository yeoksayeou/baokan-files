    Jiang Hong's Self-Criticism

    Comrade Editor: I have seen the letter of accusation against me for corruption and degeneration from the Communist Youth League Branch of the Yiyang City Public Security Bureau in Hunan Province and twenty-five comrades including Wu Chun, published in the People's Daily on March 3rd. This accusation is correct. I am extremely grateful for the sincere help of the comrades.

    As a Communist Party member, I have committed serious crimes against the people. I am very heartbroken and very sad. My mistake was caused by the corruption and attacks of the bourgeoisie after I entered the city. Because my Party spirit was not strong, I was wounded by the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets. I was planning for myself all day long, calculating personal gains and losses everywhere. I sought fame and status, pursuing personal enjoyment. I regarded myself as a meritorious person, thinking that I was a "veteran cadre" and should enjoy it. I had a very strong bourgeois privileged mentality. Therefore, I committed crimes and caused serious losses to the people's property.

    After entering the Central School of Political Science and Law Cadres, I have realized the seriousness of my mistakes through the study of the "Three-Anti" campaign. I have already examined and confessed my problems. I request the Party committee at a higher level to give me a punishment to help me correct my mistakes in the future. I deeply feel that the "Three-Anti" movement saved me and enabled me to be a new person. In the future, I will continue to reflect and examine more deeply, thoroughly eliminate bourgeois ideology, and counterattack the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie.

                                                                                                                      Jiang Hong

    江洪的检讨
    编辑同志：我看到了三月三日人民日报所载青年团湖南省益阳市公安局支部委员会及吴纯等二十五位同志对我贪污、腐化等错误的检举信。这个检举是正确的。我万分感谢同志们对我的诚恳帮助。
    我身为共产党员，但却给人民造下了深重的罪恶。我非常痛心，非常难过。我的错误，是由于我进城后受了资产阶级的腐蚀和进攻所造成的。由于我的党性不强，我是被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹击伤了。我整日为个人打算，处处计较个人得失。我闹名誉地位，追求个人享受。我以功臣自居，认为自己是“老干部”，该享受。我有很浓厚的资产阶级的特权思想。所以，我造下了罪恶，使人民资财受到严重的损失。
    我进了中央政法干部学校后，经过了关于“三反”的学习，已认识到自己的错误的严重性。我已经检查、交代了自己的问题。我要求上级党委给我处分，以帮助我今后改正错误。我深深感到“三反”运动挽救了我，使我能重新作人。今后，我要继续更深刻地反省、检查，彻底肃清资产阶级思想，并向资产阶级的猖狂进攻反击。江洪
