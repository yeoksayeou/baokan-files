On the Struggle Between the Old and the New
—A Special Article in the Truth Daily Answering Readers' Questions on January 8, 1952
USSR A. Vishnyakov

(I)
Marxist-Leninist teaches us: The struggle of opposites, the struggle between the old and the new, the struggle between the dying and the newborn is the foundation of the development of society and nature. Social life is in constant motion and development, there are always new and old, newborn and dying.
Comrade Stalin pointed out when talking about the dialectics of social life development:
    “There will always be dying things in our lives, but the
    dying are unwilling to die plainly, but to fight for their
    survival, adhering to their old causes.
    There will also be newborn things in our lives. But the
    birth of the newborn is not simple, but rather comes
    with wails and shouts to defend their right to survive.
    The struggle between the old and the new, the dying
    and the newborn, this is the basis of our development.”

The struggle between the old and the new is a law inherent in all socio-economic structures, and has its own special manifestations under specific historical conditions.
In bourgeois society where there are antagonistic classes, the struggle between the new and the old is first manifested in the cruel conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. In this struggle, the working class appears as the destroyer of the old exploitative system and the creator of the new, socialist system.
A typical example of the revolutionary solution to the antagonistic contradictions between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is the great October Socialist Revolution in our country, which has eliminated the rule of the old, exploiting classes and created the conditions for the victory of socialism.
In socialist society, there are no irreconcilable antagonistic classes. After the Soviet Union has eliminated the exploiting classes and achieved the moral and political unity of society, all the sharpness of the class struggle has turned to the world stage, to the competition between the two systems, socialism and capitalism.
Socialist society has its own new laws of development. In our country, the relationship between people in the production process is a relationship of socialist mutual assistance and comradely cooperation between workers who are not exploited. Here the relations of production are fully adapted to the productive forces. Because the public ownership of the means of production can consolidate the social nature of the production process.
    “While capitalist society is struggling to cope with the
    irreconcilable contradictions between peasants and
    landlords, workers and capitalists, which are enough to
    cause internal instability – Comrade Stalin pointed out –
    Soviet society, liberated from exploitation and oppression,
    does not know the existence of such contradictions at all.
    There are no class conflicts here, but rather a picture of
    friendly cooperation between workers, peasants and
    intellectuals."

New social development dynamics have unfolded in the Soviet Union: moral and political unity, friendship between nationalities, and vigorous Soviet patriotism, all of which are constantly growing and consolidating.
In our country, due to the absence of exploiting classes, the solidarity of socialist society, and the commonality of its economic, political, and ideological foundations, the struggle between the old and the new has been fundamentally defined as of a different, non-antagonistic nature.
In socialist society, the struggle between the old and the new is also a development from lower to higher, and is carried out in the form of criticism and self-criticism, which is the real driving force of our development and a powerful tool mastered by the Party. With the help of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, the Party can expose and eliminate shortcomings in its work to ensure the victorious construction of communism. The new can be quickly established in all aspects of life because there are no classes in our country who hate socialism to support the old, and the new can be supported and consolidated by all Soviet patriots who are personally interested in the movement towards communism.

(II)
The starting point of Marxist dialectics is that what happens and develops in life is invincible and it is impossible to stop its progress. Speaking of the method of dialectics, Comrade Stalin teaches us: what is important is not what seems solid and reliable at present, but has actually begun to decline, but what is newborn and developing.
The Bolshevik Party is constantly concerned about the new, communist sprouts in our society. Lenin wrote: “We must carefully study the new sprouts, treat them very carefully, and do everything possible to help them grow…”
The Communist Party constantly relies on the developing, promising forces in society, and has always actively supported the new progressive forces, assisting them to establish themselves. One of the most important characteristics of the Bolshevik Party is that its policy is always invariably based on the advanced, growing forces. Looking forward, not backward.
The historical mission of the working class, the creator of the new communist society, defines the role of the Communist Party as a reformer. The socialist revolution is a revolution that creatively and systematically builds communism. The Bolshevik Party is building a new socialist economy, confidently advancing along a path that no one has ever taken before. The Party abandoned the old capitalist method of industrialization and implemented the new, Soviet method of industrialization formulated by Comrade Stalin. The Party also abandoned the capitalist road of transforming small peasant economies into huge agricultural economies and embarked on the road of collectivization. Our motherland, with the will of the Bolsheviks - relying on the endless creative initiative of the masses - has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced, great industrialized-collectivized power.
The historically significant victory of socialism, which has international significance, is the result of resolutely overcoming the resistance of all conservative defenders and eradicating the capitalist factors in our country, and was obtained in an irreconcilable struggle.
Comrade Stalin pointed out in his historic speech on February 9, 1946, when talking about the role of the Party in our country's struggle for the victory of socialism:
    "Not only those who are constantly against everything new
    and backward, but also many famous party members, are
    constantly dragging the party backwards, trying every
    means to drag the party to the 'ordinary' capitalist road
    of development. All the anti-Party conspiracies of the
    rightists and Trotskyites, all their 'work' of sabotage
    against all measures of our government, are aimed at:
    sabotaging the implementation of the Party's policies and
    hindering the realization of industrialization and
    collectivization. But the Party neither bowed to the
    threats of these people, nor yielded to the shouts of
    others, and continued to move forward steadily and
    confidently without any scruples.
    The Party's merit lies in the fact that it never
    compromises with backwardness, is not afraid to move
    forward against the current, and constantly maintains
    its leading position."

Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet people are solving the great task of communist construction, building large-scale hydropower stations and canals, and transforming nature. In the process of building a communist society, the Soviet people are victoriously overcoming difficulties, eliminating shortcomings and obstacles that occur on the road to progress.
In the process of struggling for communism, new and advanced factors are manifested in the patriotic cause of the Soviet people, in their most important obligations to the motherland - labor and a conscious relationship to the interests of the country, in a conscious relationship to the completion of national economic plans and to the further development of advanced Soviet culture.
The Bolshevik Party mobilizes all working people to strive to improve labor productivity and to make all goods in the Soviet Union even richer. The Party educates the Soviet people with a sense of new things, with an unstoppable ambition to move forward, and an irreconcilable struggle against shortcomings in work and against the dying remnants of decay. The Communist Party and the Soviet state rely on the broadest masses of the people to resolutely fight against those who disrupt labor discipline and state discipline, that is, representatives of old views and old habits.
An effective method of educating people with a communist attitude towards labor is socialist competition, which demonstrates the revolutionary self-criticism of the masses' cause. The strength of competition lies in excellent examples, in the social impact on backwardness, and in promoting the creativity of the Soviet people.
Socialist competition has grown and developed in the struggle against conservatism, dogmatic thinking, and all conservative factors. The enthusiasm of the working people has become the foundation for the success of all initiatives. The Party is cautiously cultivating the advanced elements of socialist competition, turning their experience into the wealth of millions of people.
In the process of the development of socialist society, the new is growing and the old is dying in all aspects of our economy and culture. With the development of technological innovation in the national economy, the improvement of technical proficiency, and the growth of mass creativity, new and higher production quotas have replaced the old ones. Labor productivity is increasing year by year.
The Bolshevik Party appears as the inspirer and organizer of technological innovation, and it absorbs the broad masses of production creators to actively participate in the realization of this technological innovation. Huge changes have taken place in technology. More perfect technology has replaced less perfect machines, machine tools, and equipment. New technology - the technology of communism - has been born. The movement of innovators - inventors and rationalization proposers - is developing day by day. In 1950 alone, industrial enterprises received more than 600,000 rationalization proposals from workers, engineers, and technical staff. The creative friendship between production and scientific staff is consolidating and developing.
Overcoming the old and backward and the victory of the new and advanced is not achieved spontaneously or left to its own devices in our society, but is achieved as a result of the extensive organizational activities of the Party and the Soviet state, and the full assistance to new things.
However, creative spirit, courageous advocacy, valuable rationalization proposals and inventions, and advanced labor methods sometimes encounter opposition from individual backward workers who have no feeling for new things.
Georgy Nezhivenko, a lathe operator who won the Stalin Prize, pointed out: When new things appear in the production process, they often encounter difficulties. "For example," he wrote, "let's talk about how the movement of high-speed lathe work has developed in our factory. Two years ago, only individual workers in our factory had dreamed of high-speed turning and cutting, and now we have ninety high-speed lathe workers. As for the fact that we high-speed lathe workers had to engage in fierce disputes with those conservative elements who tried to prove that it was impossible to use high-speed cutting under the conditions of our factory, it was actually not long ago."
The Soviet government is implementing socialist plans on a scientific basis, organizing the execution of national economic plans, and resolutely implementing the socialist principle of distribution according to work, doing everything possible to assist the consolidation of the new communist sprouts in our country.
The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state are creating all the most favorable conditions to enable better development of technological progress and new improvement of the socialist economy. At the same time, the Party will never condone those empty plans and the enthusiasts who specialize in compiling various unrealizable designs that can only seriously harm our cause.
Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism play an important role in the struggle for progressive, new things. The Party resolutely supports criticism from the bottom up - from workers, collective farm members, and Soviet intellectuals - because this criticism can embody the huge construction experience of millions of working masses.
    "If we cannot honestly and frankly point out and expose
    the shortcomings and errors in our work as Bolsheviks
    should," Comrade Stalin pointed out, "the result will only
    be to close our own road to progress. But we are willing
    to move forward. Precisely because we are willing to
    move forward, we should regard sincere and revolutionary
    self-criticism as one of our most important tasks.
    Otherwise, we cannot move forward. Otherwise, we
    cannot develop."

Our young collective farm system has been continuously consolidated on the basis of the struggle between the new and the old, and the dying. In the struggle against the remnants of the old and against private tendencies, the Party relies on the overwhelming majority of collective farm peasant masses who are loyal to labor and truly understand their responsibilities to the country.
The characteristic of the Soviet people is to treat socialist public property with a sense of ownership and care. The Party educates the Soviet people to conduct an irreconcilable struggle against those who steal from the people's welfare and waste state assets and materials. Our people regard the interests of the Soviet state as higher than everything else. They are selflessly working to expand and strengthen the wealth of the socialist motherland. The Soviet people are constantly winning victories in their work because they are neither arrogant nor complacent, and they do not rest content with existing achievements, but mainly measure their achievements by the great tasks of the future.

(III)
The struggle between the new and the old is manifested in all aspects of social life. It is manifested not only in the economic field, but also in the fields of ideology, science, literature, and art.
In our country, socialist life determines the consciousness of the Soviet people. However, some Soviet people still retain the remnants of capitalism. Comrade Stalin teaches us: People's consciousness lags behind their economic conditions. In addition, there is the capitalist encirclement, which tries its best to revive and support the old remnants in the consciousness of our people.
The Bolshevik Party is conducting huge communist education work for the working people. It takes a resolute offensive against the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness. It is impossible to build communism without completely eradicating the remnants of capitalism in the consciousness of our people.
The higher the communist consciousness of the working people, the stronger the strength of the Soviet state and the greater the achievements of communist construction.
The basis of communist education for the working people is Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism is the science of the laws of development of society and nature, the science of the revolution of the oppressed and exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries and the construction of a communist society.
The Bolshevik Party arms the masses with a Marxist worldview that is never reconciled with the remnants of bourgeois ideology and various prejudices and superstitions. At the same time, the Party educates the Soviet people with advanced socialist ideas, proletarian internationalism, the creative ideas of Soviet patriots, and revolutionary national self-esteem.
Soviet patriots, cultivated under the great Marxist-Leninist ideology, resolutely oppose the ideological manifestations of reactionary bourgeois nationalism and cosmopolitanism, and extremely hate the subservience and flattery towards the corrupt European bourgeois culture. The Party leads advanced Soviet scientists, writers, and artists to resolutely struggle to establish the Bolshevik Party spirit, oppose manifestations of non-ideological principles and non-political principles, and oppose various attempts to allow alien, anti-patriotic views to invade the Soviet ideological system.
The historic resolutions of the Central Committee of the CPSU on issues of literature and art, and the creative free debates on various knowledge initiated by Comrade Stalin, are vivid evidence of the constant concern of the Leninist-Stalinist Party for consolidating and developing new communist things in the ideological system. The measures of the Bolshevik Party lie in resolutely overcoming the influence of the reactionary bourgeois ideological system, eliminating the conservative and outdated things in science, and further developing advanced Soviet science and art. Comrade Stalin teaches us: The struggle of various opinions and freedom of criticism are indispensable conditions for the development of various sciences. And this is even more true for Soviet science - the most advanced science in the world. Soviet science is closely linked to life, it ruthlessly abandons all outdated traditions, and cannot tolerate those who hold conservative ideas, follow old habits, and take an indifferent attitude towards new sprouts.
The Leninist-Stalinist Party is widely carrying out ideological work and political education among the masses in order to solve one of the most important tasks of communist construction. Under the present conditions, educating working people to meet the requirements of communism is of decisive significance. As the masses' level of communist consciousness increases, we can more victoriously overcome the old and dying and accelerate our cause of advancing towards communism.

    论旧和新的斗争
    ——一九五二年一月八日真理报答读者问题的专论
    苏联  阿·维什尼雅阔夫
    （一）
    马克思—列宁主义教导我们：对立物的斗争，旧和新的斗争，垂死者和新生者之间的斗争乃是社会和自然界底发展基础。社会生活在不断地运动和发展，经常存在着新的和旧的，新生者和垂死者。
    斯大林同志在谈到社会生活发展的辩证法时指出：
    “在我们生活中经常会有死去的，但是垂死者
    不愿平淡地死去，要为自己的生存而斗争，坚持
    着自己陈旧的事业。
    在我们生活中也经常会有新生的。但是新生者
    之降生也颇不简单，而是呼嚎，喊叫着来捍卫自
    己生存的权利。
    旧的与新的，垂死者与新生者之间的斗争，这
    就是我们发展底基础。”
    旧和新的斗争是一切社会经济结构所固有的法则，在具体的历史条件下有其特殊的表现形式。
    在有对抗阶级存在的资产阶级社会里，新和旧的斗争首先是表现在无产阶级和资产阶级的残酷的冲突中。在这一斗争中，工人阶级是以旧的剥削制度底破坏者和新的、社会主义制度底创造者的资格出现的。
    无产阶级和资产阶级间对抗矛盾之革命解决底典型例子，就是在我们国内业已消灭了旧的、剥削阶级底统治并已创造了社会主义之胜利条件的伟大的十月社会主义革命。
    在社会主义社会中没有不可调和的敌对的阶级存在。当苏联已肃清剥削阶级并已取得社会道义的和政治的统一之后，则对我国说来，阶级斗争底全部锋芒即已转向世界舞台，进行两种制度之间的，即社会主义和资本主义之间的竞赛去了。
    社会主义社会自有其新的发展规律。在我们国内人和人在生产过程中的相互关系乃是不受剥削的工作者之间的社会主义互助和同志合作的关系。生产关系在这里和生产力是完全适应的。因为生产资料的公有制可以巩固生产过程底社会性质。
    “当资本主义社会正苦于应付其足以造成内部
    不稳定的农民与地主，工人与资本家之间的不可
    调和的矛盾时——斯大林同志指出——由剥削压
    迫下解放出来的苏维埃社会则根本不知道有这
    种矛盾底存在，这里没有阶级冲突，而恰似一幅
    工人、农民、知识分子友谊合作的图画。”
    在苏联展开了新的社会发展底动力：社会道义和政治的统一，各民族间的友谊，蓬勃的苏维埃爱国主义，所有这些都在不断地壮大和巩固。
    在我们国内，由于没有剥削阶级，由于社会主义社会的团结一致，由于其经济、政治和思想基础底共同性，因而旧和新的斗争已被原则地确定为另外的，不是敌对的性质了。
    在社会主义社会里，旧和新的斗争，同时也是由低级到高级的发展，是在批评和自我批评底形式下进行的，后者乃是我们发展底真正的动力，是党所掌握的有力的工具。党借助于布尔什维克的批评和自我批评可以揭露并清除工作中的缺点以保证胜利的共产主义建设。在全部生活底各方面新的之能以迅速地确立是因为在我们国内已无有仇恨社会主义的阶级来支持旧的，新的可以得到全体对走向共产主义的运动感到切身兴趣的苏维埃爱国者底拥护并巩固起来。
    （二）
    马克思辩证法底出发点是：生活中所发生和发展的东西是不可征服的，停止它底前进是不可能的。说到辩证法的方法，斯大林同志教导我们的：重要的首先不是在目前看来稳固可靠，但实际已开始衰亡的东西，而是新生的和发展的东西。
    布尔什维克党对我们社会中新的，共产主义底萌芽是经常关怀的。列宁写道：“我们必须仔细地研究新的萌芽，非常注意地对待它们，尽一切力量帮助它们底长成……”
    共产党经常倚靠着社会上在发展中的，有前途的力量，无论过去和现在都经常积极地支持着新的进步的力量，协助它们确立起来。布尔什维克党底最重要的特点之一在于它底政策是始终不变地倚靠着先进的、生长的力量。向前看，而不是向后看。
    新的共产主义社会底创造者——工人阶级底历史使命规定了作为革新者之党的共产党底作用。社会主义革命即创造地和有计划地建设共产主义的革命。布尔什维克党建设着新的社会主义的经济，有把握地沿着前此无人走过的道路前进。党摒弃了旧的资本主义工业化底方法并实行了新的，斯大林同志制定的苏维埃工业化的方法。党同样地摒弃了把小农经济转变为巨大的农业经济的资本主义道路而走上了集体化的道路。我们的祖国凭着布尔什维克底意志——倚靠群众底无穷尽的有创造性的积极性——已由落后的农业国转变为先进的，伟大的工业化——集体化的强国了。
    社会主义之具有国际意义的历史性的胜利是由于我们国内已肃清资本主义底因素并坚决克服所有守旧的辩护者底抵抗之结果，而在不可调和的斗争中获得的。
    斯大林同志在一九四六年二月九日的历史性的演说里谈到我国在争取社会主义胜利的斗争中党底作用时指出：
    “不只是那些经常反对一切新的，落后的人
    们，而且也有很多有名的党员在内，都在经常地
    把党向后拖，用尽一切方法企图把党拖到‘普通
    的’资本主义底发展道路上去。右派与托派分子
    底一切反党的阴谋手段，他们对我国政府底一切
    措施采取怠工行为的全部‘工作’，其目的都在
    于：破坏党的政策底执行并阻碍工业化与集体化
    底实现。但是党既没有向这些人底威胁低头，也
    没有向另些人底喊叫让步，仍然是毫无顾虑地有
    信心地稳步前进。
    党的功绩在于它永不迁就落后，不怕逆流前进
    并经常地保持着自己主导力量底立场。”
    苏维埃人民在布尔什维克党底领导下正在解决着伟大的共产主义建设的任务，修筑着规模宏大的水电站和运河，改造着自然界。苏维埃人民在建设共产主义社会的进程中胜利地克服着困难，摒除着前进路上所发生的缺点和障碍。
    在为共产主义奋斗的进程中，新的因素和先进的因素表现在苏维埃人民底爱国主义事业中，表现在他们对祖国的最重要义务——劳动和对国家利益的自觉的关系上，表现在对完成国民经济计划以及对进一步发展先进的苏维埃文化的自觉的关系上。
    布尔什维克党动员全体劳动人民为提高劳动生产率，为作到使苏联底一切物品更加丰富而奋斗。党教育苏联人民以对新事物之感觉，以不可遏止的勇往直前的志向，对工作中的缺点，对垂死的腐朽的残余进行不可调和的斗争。共产党和苏维埃国家倚靠着最广大的人民群众，对劳动纪律和国家纪律底破坏者，即旧观点和旧习惯底代表者进行坚决的斗争。
    教育人们以共产主义态度对待劳动的有效方法乃是社会主义竞赛，后者表现出群众底事业性的革命的自我批评。竞赛底力量在于优良的实例，在于社会对落后的影响，在于发扬苏维埃人民底创造精神。
    社会主义竞赛在和墨守成规，因循思想以及和一切保守主义因素的斗争中得到了壮大和发展。劳动人民底积极性成为一切创举成功底基础。党在谨慎关怀地培养着社会主义竞赛底先进者们，把他们底经验变成为千百万人的财富。
    在社会主义社会发展底过程中，在我们经济和文化底各方面，新的在长成，旧的在死亡。随着国民经济技术革新底发展，技术熟练程度底提高，群众创造精神底增长，新的、更高的生产定额代替了那些旧的定额。劳动生产率在一年比一年地提高着。
    布尔什维克党是以对技术革新的鼓舞者和组织者底姿态出现的，它吸收了生产创造者的广大群众积极参加实现这种技术的革新。在技术方面发生了巨大的改变。更加完善的技术代替了不太完善的机器、机床和设备。新的技术——共产主义底技术出世了。革新者——发明家和合理化提倡者底运动一天天地在发展着。只在一九五○年度工业企业部门就收到了来自工人、工程师和技术工作人员的六十多万条合理化建议。生产和科学工作人员底创造的友谊关系在巩固并发展着。
    克服旧的、落后的和新的、先进的获得胜利，在我们社会内既不是凭着自发，也不是任其自流，而是由于有了党和苏维埃国家底广泛的组织者底活动，对新事物的全力协助的结果方能作到的。
    但是创造精神，勇敢的倡导，宝贵的合理化建议和发明，先进的劳动方法，有时也会遇到一些对新鲜事物毫无感觉的个别落后的工作人员底反对。
    荣获斯大林奖金的镟工匠格·聂若文柯指出：当新事物在生产过程中出现时经常会遇到困难的。“例如——他写道——说一说我们厂内高速镟工的运动是怎样开展的。两年前，我们厂内只有个别的工人幻想过高速的镟磨和切削，而现在我们已有着九十个高速镟工了。至于说到我们这些高速镟工曾不得不和那些守旧的，企图证明在我们厂底条件下不可能使用高速切削的顽固分子进行激烈争论的情形，则其实是不久以前的事情。”
    苏联政府在科学基础上实现着社会主义计划，组织国民经济计划的执行，并坚决实现社会主义按劳分配底原则，尽一切方法协助我国新的共产主义萌芽底巩固。
    布尔什维克党和苏维埃国家创造着一切最便利的条件，以使技术进步得到更好的发展和社会主义经济得到新的提高。但同时党也绝不纵容那些空洞的计划和专门编制只能使我们事业遭受严重损害的各种不能实现的设计底爱好者。
    布尔什维克的批评和自我批评在为进步的、新事物的斗争中起着重要的作用。党坚决支持自下而上——来自工人、集体农庄庄员、苏维埃知识分子方面——的批评，因为这种批评可以体现出成百万劳动群众底巨大的建设经验。
    “如果我们不能像布尔什维克所应该作的那样
    来诚恳坦白地指出并揭露我们工作中的缺点与
    错误，——斯大林同志指出——则结果只是自己
    封闭自己底前进道路。但我们又是愿意前进的。
    正因为我们愿意前进，所以我们应该把真诚的与
    革命的自我批评作为我们底一个最重要的任务。
    否则就不能前进。否则也就不能发展。”
    我们年青的集体农庄制度就是在新和旧的、衰亡的斗争底基础上得到了不断的巩固。党在反对旧的残余，反对私有倾向的斗争中就倚靠着占绝对优势的、忠实于劳动并切实了解自己对国家所负之责任的集体农庄的农民群众。
    苏维埃人民底特点是以主人感的爱护的态度对待社会主义底公有财产。党教育苏维埃人民对人民福利底窃盗者和对国家资产、材料底浪费者应进行不可调和的斗争。我们的人民把苏维埃国家底利益看得高于一切。他们为社会主义祖国财富底扩大和增强而忘我地劳动着。苏维埃人民在自己底工作中不断地获得胜利是因为他们既不骄傲也不自满，不因已有的成绩而自安自慰，而主要地是以未来的伟大的任务来衡量自己底成绩。
    （三）
    新和旧的斗争是表现在社会生活底各方面的。它不仅表现在经济方面，而且也表现在思想、科学、文学和艺术各方面。
    在我们国内社会主义生活决定着苏维埃人民底意识。但是，一部分苏维埃人仍保存有资本主义底残余。斯大林同志教导我们：人们底意识是落后于其经济状况的。此外，还有资本主义的包围，极力想法在我们的人民底意识中复活并支持旧的残余。
    布尔什维克党对劳动人民进行着巨大的共产主义的教育工作。它对人民意识中的资本主义残余采取坚决的攻势。不能彻底肃清我们人民意识中的资本主义残余就不可能建设共产主义。
    劳动人民的共产主义觉悟愈高，则苏维埃国家底力量愈强，共产主义建设底成就也愈大。
    对劳动人民的共产主义教育底基础是马克思—列宁主义。马克思—列宁主义是社会和自然界发展规律底科学，是被压迫被剥削群众革命底科学，是关于世界各国社会主义胜利的科学和共产主义社会建设的科学。
    布尔什维克党以对待资产阶级思想底残余和各种成见及迷信决不调和的马克思主义的世界观来武装群众。党同时以先进的社会主义思想，以无产阶级国际主义，以苏维埃爱国者的创造思想和革命的民族自尊心来教育苏联人民。
    在伟大的马克思—列宁主义思想下培养起来的苏维埃爱国者坚决反对反动的资产阶级民族主义和世界主义底思想表现，并极端憎恶对腐败的欧洲资产阶级文化的卑躬屈节和俯首逢迎。党领导着先进的苏维埃的科学家、作家和艺术工作者为树立布尔什维克的党性，反对无思想原则和无政治原则的表现，反对使异己的反爱国主义观点侵入苏维埃思想体系的各种企图而进行坚决的斗争。
    联共党中央对文学、艺术问题之有历史性的决议，和斯大林同志发起的对各种知识之有创造性的自由辩论，乃是列宁—斯大林的党经常关心着巩固并发展思想体系中共产主义底新事物的鲜明证据。布尔什维克党底措施在于坚决克服反动的资产阶级思想体系底影响，摒除科学中的保守主义的陈旧的，而进一步发展先进的苏维埃的科学和艺术。斯大林同志教导我们：各种意见的斗争和批评自由乃是各种科学之发展的必不可少的条件。而对于苏维埃的科学——世界上最先进的科学说来，则更是如此。苏维埃的科学是和生活密切联系着的，它无情地摒弃一切陈旧的传统，不能忍受那些守旧思想、因循习惯以及对新的萌芽采取漠不关心的态度。
    列宁—斯大林的党在群众中广泛开展思想工作和政治教育，以求解决共产主义建设的一项最重要的任务。在现在条件下，教育劳动人民，使之合乎共产主义的要求是具有决定意义的。随着群众对共产主义觉悟程度的提高，更可以胜利地克服陈旧的、衰亡的并加速我们向共产主义道路前进的事业。
