    Statement by the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and Four Other People's Organizations:
    Resolutely Respond to the Solemn Call of China's Democratic Parties
    Counterattack the American Aggressors' Bacteriological Warfare with Practical Actions
    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, the Beijing Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, the Beijing Youth Federation, and the Beijing Student Federation jointly issued a statement protesting the American imperialists' bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. The statement is as follows:
    We feel boundless anger at the towering crime of American imperialism in spreading bacteria in Korea and Northeast China. We firmly support the solemn statements made by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, on February 24th and around March 8th, and lodge a serious protest to the heinous American imperialists.
    American imperialism dares to carry out inhumane bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. This not only fully proves the savage and brutal nature of American imperialism, but also proves that although American imperialism has suffered severe blows in the war of aggression against Korea, it still has no remorse and attempts to prolong and expand the war of aggression, not hesitating to be enemies of human civilization and justice. This towering crime of American imperialism will not only be bitterly hated by the people of China and Korea, who are determined to fight it resolutely, but will also arouse the common indignation of peace-loving people all over the world, who will unanimously condemn it.
    The workers, women, youth, and students of the entire capital unanimously respond to the call of China's democratic parties. We are determined to make a hundred times the effort to unite the people of Asia and the world, strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, thoroughly complete the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, vigorously increase production and practice thrift, study hard, and be prepared to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and go to the forefront of eliminating germs. We will respond to the mad provocation of the American aggressors with resolute struggle and give the criminals of bacteriological warfare a crushing blow.

    北京市总工会等五个人民团体声明
    坚决响应我国各民主党派的庄严号召
    用实际行动反击美国侵略者的细菌战
    【本报讯】北京市总工会、北京市民主妇女联合会、新民主主义青年团北京市委员会、北京市民主青年联合会、北京市学生联合会联名发表声明，抗议美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战争。声明如下：
    我们对于美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北撒布细菌的滔天罪行，感到无比的愤怒。我们坚决拥护我中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来在二月二十四日和三月八日前后两次严正的声明，并向罪恶滔天的美帝国主义者提出严重的抗议。
    美帝国主义胆敢在朝鲜和我国东北进行绝灭人性的细菌战，不仅充分证明美帝国主义野蛮残暴的本质，而且也证明美帝国主义虽在侵略朝鲜的战争中遭受了严重的打击，却仍无悔祸之心，企图延长与扩大侵略战争，不惜与人类的文明和正义为敌。美帝国主义这种滔天罪行，不仅为中朝两国人民所切齿痛恨，决心与之作坚决的斗争，也必将引起全世界爱好和平的人民同仇敌忾，一致声讨。
    我们全首都的工人、妇女、青年和学生一致响应中国各民主党派的号召，我们决心以百倍的努力，团结亚洲和世界人民，加强抗美援朝的工作，彻底完成反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，厉行增产节约，努力学习，并准备随时响应祖国的号召，走上扑灭毒菌的最前线。我们将以坚决的奋斗来回答美国侵略者的疯狂挑衅，给细菌战争罪犯以粉碎性的打击。
