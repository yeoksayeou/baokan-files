	The Xiaohe Dam, the second modernized water conservancy project in Shanxi Province completed last year, and the Minsheng and Minfeng Canals began releasing water last month to irrigate farmland on both banks. This year, the two canals plan to irrigate 340,000 mu of land.

	Before the water release, the irrigation areas mobilized farmers to do a lot of preparatory work. As early as December last year, the Xiaohe Water Conservancy Committee mobilized farmers in Xugou County to build the Dunhua and Jiaping weirs. Now the two weirs have stored 3.03 million cubic meters of ice and water, which can irrigate more than 25,000 mu of land. At present, the Xiaohe Water Conservancy Committee has specifically formulated measures to strengthen the management of river and canal irrigation and a plan for rational water use.

	Nearly 800,000 Huai River harnessing civil workers participating in the excavation of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal continue to work amidst strong winds, heavy rain, and heavy snow. After the snow, they swept the snow and broke the ice to quickly resume work.

	Since the start of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal project this spring, it has encountered several strong winds, heavy rains, and heavy snows. The coldest temperature reached minus fifteen degrees Celsius, the ground was frozen, the soil was hard, and in some places, the snow was as deep as a foot, which caused serious difficulties for the progress of the project. However, in order to strive to complete the irrigation main canal as soon as possible, the civil workers started sweeping snow and working before the weather cleared and the ice melted. In one day, the civil workers of the 2,000-plus work sheds of the Lianshui County Civil Workers Brigade cleared more than 61,800 carts of snow on the construction site. As soon as the wind and snow stopped, 6,000 civil workers from the Huaiyin County Civil Workers Brigade resumed work. When they encountered hard frozen soil, they used hammers and stone rollers to break it open, creating cracks, and then used sticks to pry open the frozen soil in whole pieces and continued to dig. The civil workers of the Bao'ying County Civil Workers Brigade were even more active in sweeping snow. Tan Hongjun, an old civil worker in his fifties, and his civil worker group worked even harder amidst the flying snowflakes. Wang Likang, a member of the Communist Youth League, had cracked hands and feet and scraped shoulders, but he still did not slack off. His civil worker group could still dig an average of 3.2 cubic meters of soil per person on snowy days, setting the highest record for the entire brigade.

	Amidst the strong winds and heavy snow, cadres at all levels on the Huai River harnessing construction site personally went deep into the work sheds to comfort the vast number of Huai River harnessing civil workers and help them solve various specific difficulties. A mutual aid and love movement of "sharing blankets" and "lending clothes" was also launched among the civil workers. Farmers in Funing, Binhai, and other counties in northern Jiangsu also transported a large number of cotton clothes to support the thinly clothed civil workers. Many medical workers on the Huai River harnessing construction site patrolled in the wind and snow to treat the civil workers.

Xinhua News Agency - The Yishui Prefectural People's Government of Shandong Province has mobilized farmers in mountainous areas to launch large-scale soil and water conservation projects and small-scale farmland water conservancy projects with great success. Last winter, the entire prefecture built more than 12,100 dammed gullies and slow-water dams, and directly planted 128,000 mu of forests. Among them, Ju-Yi County, which is the key undertaking for soil and water conservation projects, had dammed a total of 1,412 mountain gullies and silted up many dams in the winter of 1950. Last autumn, some of these dams had been planted with wheat, and some had been planted with tree seedlings. Last year, the Ju-Yi County People's Government allocated another 1.2 million catties of millet to help farmers build 606 slow-water dams. Last winter, more than 90% of the farmers in Ju-Yi County participated in soil and water conservation projects, building a total of 4,499 dammed gullies and slow-water dams in two months. These projects can protect the existing 3,390-plus mu of arable land, and can also silt up 3,350-plus mu of arable land in two years.

	This year, Yishui Prefecture plans to dam 68,000 mountain gullies and plant 330,000 mu of trees, about half of which can be completed in the spring. In addition, this spring, Yishui Prefecture will also mobilize farmers to close 910,000 mu of mountains and 60,000 mu of river beaches; mobilize farmers to universally repair land weirs, clear stone ponds, dig mountain springs, repair stream channels, and dig wells.

### 山西潇河大坝和民生民丰两渠放水春浇  苏北灌溉总渠八十万民工在大风大雨大雪中奋力施工  山东沂水专区大量兴办水土保持工程和小型农田水利

    山西潇河大坝和民生民丰两渠放水春浇
    苏北灌溉总渠八十万民工在大风大雨大雪中奋力施工
    山东沂水专区大量兴办水土保持工程和小型农田水利
    去年修成的山西省第二个近代化的水利工程潇河大坝和民生、民丰两渠，已在上月开始放水浇灌两岸的农田。今年，两条渠计划浇地三十四万亩。
    放水前各灌溉区都发动农民作了不少的准备工作。早在去年十二月，潇河水利委员会便在徐沟县发动农民修筑了敦化、嘉平两堰。现在两堰已囤冰蓄水三百零三万立方公尺，可浇地两万五千亩以上。目前，潇河水利委员会已具体地制订了加强河渠灌溉管理办法和合理使水的计划。
    参加开挖苏北灌溉总渠的近八十万治淮民工，在大风、大雨、大雪中，继续施工。雪后，他们又扫雪、开冰，迅速地恢复工作。
    苏北灌溉总渠工程今春开工以来，连续遇到几场大风、大雨、大雪。最冷时到零下十五度，地面冰封，泥土坚硬，有的地方积雪深达一尺左右，使工程的进行遭到严重的困难。但是，民工们为了争取早日把灌溉总渠修竣，不等天晴冰化，就动手扫雪施工。涟水县民工总队二千多个工棚的民工一天之间在工地上扫除积雪六万一千八百多车。风雪刚停，淮阴县民工总队就有六千民工复工。他们碰到坚硬的冻土，便用榔头、石硪敲打，打开一条条裂缝，用棍把整块冻土撬开，继续动锹挖土。宝应县民工大队的民工，扫雪更积极。五十岁的老民工谈洪俊和他那个民工小组，在雪花纷飞中干得更起劲。青年团员王立康手脚冻裂了、肩膀擦破了皮，仍然不怠慢一步。他们这个民工小组在下雪天，每人平均还能挖土三点二公方，创造了全大队的最高纪录。
    在大风大雪中，治淮工地上的各级干部都亲自深入工棚，慰问广大治淮民工，并帮助民工解决各项具体困难。民工之间也发动了“合被”、“让衣”的互助友爱运动。苏北区阜宁、滨海等县农民，还运来大批的棉衣，支援衣服单薄的民工。治淮工地上的许多医务工作人员，在风雪中巡回地给民工治病。
    山东省沂水专区人民政府，发动山区农民兴办大规模的水土保持工程和小型农田水利工程已有很大的成绩。去冬全专区闸山沟和筑缓水坝共一万二千
    一百多座，直播造林十二万八千亩。其中作为重点兴办水土保持工程的莒沂县，在一九五○年冬季，就共闸了一千四百一十二道山沟，淤平了不少坝子。去年秋天，这些坝子有的已种上小麦，有的已插了树苗。去年莒沂县人民政府又拨了一百二十万斤小米，扶助农民筑成了六百零六道缓水坝。去冬，莒沂县百分之九十以上的农民都参加水土保持工程，两个月内共闸山沟和筑缓水坝四千四百九十九座。这些工程能保护现有的三千三百九十多亩耕地，两年以后还可淤成耕地三千三百五十多亩。
    今年沂水专区又计划闸山沟六万八千道，植树造林三十三万亩，春季可完成一半左右。另外，今年春天，沂水专区还要发动农民封山九十一万亩，封河滩六万亩；发动农民普遍修地堰、清石塘、扒山泉、修涧渠和打井。（新华社）
