    Chinese Railway Trade Union Suihua Sub-district Committee
    Self-Criticism of the Mistake of Stockpiling Condolence Gifts

    To the Editorial Department: The People's Daily's criticism on February 23rd regarding the Suihua Railway Trade Union Committee's misuse of condolence gifts and money is entirely correct, and I humbly accept the criticism. At the end of 1950, when the victorious news of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side and defeating the American invading army came, railway workers were extremely excited, and everyone enthusiastically donated condolence gifts. We sent the first batch of condolence gifts we received to the relevant departments for forwarding to the front lines. Later, we continued to receive many more condolence gifts. At that time, we thought that there were so many condolence gifts, and there would be even greater news of victory from the Korean battlefield, so we should wait until that time to offer condolences. Under the control of this thinking, we stockpiled the condolence gifts in the warehouse, without assigning anyone to be specifically responsible for proper safekeeping. Our failure to handle them promptly was already a big mistake, but even more serious was our unscrupulous use of condolence gifts and money at will. When the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began, I had not yet realized the seriousness of this mistake, and only made a perfunctory self-criticism at the mass meeting. Later, the Qiqihar Railway Bureau inspection team came to the sub-district committee for inspection, and issued a circular of criticism, and the People's Railway News also criticized us. At this time, I began to realize the error, and at the same time, I returned all the remaining condolence gifts and money, as well as the damaged, used, and borrowed condolence gifts in full, and sent them all to the responsible authorities for handling.

    Now, I have realized that the mistake of stockpiling and wasting condolence gifts is serious. I have not only erased the patriotic enthusiasm of all railway workers, but also hindered our most beloved people from receiving the most sublime love from the people of the motherland. I have committed a serious political error. This is the evil consequence of my usual neglect of politics. In addition to humbly accepting criticism and being willing to sincerely accept any punishment given to me by the higher authorities, I will continue to examine my non-proletarian thoughts, strengthen my studies, improve my political understanding, and actively participate in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, in order to improve myself in this great movement.

    Guo Tinglai, Vice Chairman of the Suihua Sub-district Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union

### 中国铁路工会绥化分区委员会  检讨积压慰问品的错误

    中国铁路工会绥化分区委员会
    检讨积压慰问品的错误
    编辑同志：二月二十三日人民日报对绥化铁路工会委员会乱用慰问品和慰问金的批评，是完全正确的，我虚心接受批评。在一九五零年年底，当中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，击败美国侵略军的胜利消息传来时，铁路职工万分兴奋，大家热烈捐献慰问品。我们把首批收到的慰问品送到了有关部门转送前方。以后我们又继续收到了许多慰问品。这时，我们认为，慰问品这样多，朝鲜战场还会有更大的胜利消息传来，等那个时候再慰问吧。在这种思想支配下，我们就把慰问品堆存到仓库里，也没有指定专人负责，好好保管。我们不及时处理，已经是很大的错误，更严重的是我们肆无忌惮地把慰问品、慰问金随便使用。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，我还没有认识到这个错误的严重性，只在群众大会上作了一个轻描淡写的检讨。后来齐齐哈尔铁路局检查组到分区委员会来检查，并通报批评，人民铁道报也对我们提出批评，这时，我对错误才开始有了认识，同时把剩余的慰问品、慰问金，以及被污损的、动用的、借出的慰问品一律按数偿还，全部送到负责机关处理。
    现在，我已认识到积压和浪费慰问品的错误是严重的，我不但抹杀了全路职工爱国的热情，同时也阻碍了我们最可爱的人接受祖国人民对他们最崇高的热爱。我犯了严重的政治错误。这是我平常忽视政治所造成的恶果。我除虚心接受批评，并愿意诚恳接受上级给我的任何处分外，我要继续检查我的非无产阶级思想，加强学习，提高政治认识，并积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，以便在这伟大的运动中提高一步。
    中国铁路工会绥化分区委员会副主席  郭廷来
