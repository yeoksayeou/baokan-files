    Work of the Tianjin Textile Workers' Rapid Literacy Experimental Class
    Tianjin Textile Workers' Rapid Literacy Experimental Class Committee
    The National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China and the Tianjin Municipal Committee held a one-month rapid literacy experimental class for textile workers in Tianjin. A total of twenty-nine students participated in the experimental class (eight males and twenty-one females, generally around twenty years old, the youngest being seventeen and the oldest forty). Originally, they knew an average of 521.77 characters each, the highest knowing 1,083 characters, and the lowest knowing 17 characters.
    From the beginning to the end of the experimental class (from January 3rd to February 3rd), excluding holidays, the actual study time was only twenty-three days (195.5 hours). Due to the superiority of the rapid literacy method and the active efforts of the students, great achievements were made in learning. The students improved from an average of 521.77 characters each to an average of 2,108 characters each, and generally could read ordinary books and newspapers and write simple short articles. For example, student Yang Lihua, who originally knew 583 characters, can now recognize 2,281 characters, and can read the fourth volume of Elementary Mandarin, the fourth volume of Advanced Mandarin, as well as the China Textile Workers magazine, Korean News Agency dispatches, and editorials from the Tianjin Daily, and has written two manuscripts of 1,000 to 1,500 characters. The factory's workers and cadres all said with envy: "After you study, you must bring this method back and promote it in our factory."
    The entire teaching process, apart from ideological mobilization at the beginning, is divided into the following three stages:
    I. Phonetic Symbols and Pinyin Teaching: Phonetic symbols are a tool to assist literacy, and can help students remember new characters. Therefore, the quality of phonetic symbol teaching will directly affect students' learning achievements and learning emotions, and is related to the overall teaching effect.
    This time, phonetic symbol teaching took a total of 17.82 hours. The teaching steps are based on the principle of starting from easy to difficult, first teaching the medial symbols "一メ凵", then the initial consonants, and then the final vowels, without being restricted by the order of symbol arrangement.
    Adding pictures next to the phonetic symbols, so that the sound of the phonetic symbols is combined with the image of the picture next to it, is lively and easy to remember, and is of great help to learning.
    After all the phonetic symbols can be recognized and can "move house" (leave the order of phonetic symbol arrangement and can be read independently, which is called moving house), then the pinyin teaching begins. When teaching pinyin, first teach single-syllable pinyin, the key is "what the symbol sounds like, the character sounds like"; secondly, teach two-syllable pinyin, the key is "the first sound is light and short, the second sound is heavy, whatever is spelled out is what is read"; finally, teach three-syllable pinyin, the key is "first spell the first and second sounds, then spell with the third sound". The teacher should explain the key points in detail first, so that everyone can master the key points of pinyin, which is very important when learning pinyin. This pinyin method based on two-syllable pinyin is simple and easy to learn, laying the foundation for a blitz of new characters.
    After the students have mastered the pinyin method, they can choose those characters that the students are most familiar with and have heavy and loud pronunciations, and compile a pinyin practice table so that the students can boldly affirm the sounds of the characters when practicing pinyin. After truly mastering the key points of pinyin and daring to affirm the sounds of the characters, there is generally no difficulty in blitzing new characters.
    II. Blitzing New Characters: After learning pinyin, there are conditions for blitzing a large number of new characters.
    Blitzing new characters is the most important and intense stage in the entire teaching process. Every student must concentrate their energy and blitz a large number of new characters in this short period of time. This experimental class used 81 hours, and blitzed a total of 2,281 characters. As a result, all students recognized an average of 2,108 characters each (this number is based on the final determination after reading and writing).
    The teaching steps for blitzing new characters are divided into classroom teaching and group review. In classroom teaching, the teacher first leads the students to spell and read the characters two or three times to make them familiar with pinyin and master the sounds of the characters. Then, explain the meaning of the characters, the explanation should be concise and vivid, and related to reality, in order to deepen the impression of the characters. When one-third of the new characters are blitzed, the radicals and components of the characters can be explained to help students remember new characters and prepare for using the dictionary.
    After classroom teaching, groups are organized to learn from each other, taking methods such as mutual teaching, mutual learning, mutual testing, and mutual questioning. Group mutual assistance learning accounts for two-thirds of the total teaching time, so it is extremely important to do a good job in group mutual assistance.
    This time, 330 characters were taught every day in the blitzing of new characters. At the beginning, the average acceptance capacity of the students was 295 characters per person, but later it increased to 322 characters. In this stage, it is necessary to flexibly grasp the teaching progress, and appropriately increase or decrease it according to the students' acceptance capacity in a timely manner, and not follow rigid regulations. When blitzing new characters to a certain point, sufficient time should be given to review the learned characters, and focus on blitzing difficult-to-recognize characters, in order to consolidate the learned characters and continue to learn all the characters.
    III. Reading and Writing: In the stage of reading, writing characters, and writing sentences, single characters can be reviewed, and the learned sounds, meanings, and shapes of characters can be gradually enriched, so that single characters are combined with actual life, and the requirements for students to master cultural tools are initially realized. This stage took a total of 396 hours. The learning process is carried out in segmented and cross-cutting reading, writing characters, and writing sentences. But first, reading is the main focus, and writing new characters and sentences is secondary; then, focus on writing sentences. Because the students have rich life experience and strong comprehension, as long as they can connect the characters into sentences, they generally do not need the teacher to explain, and they can understand the content themselves.
    The main method of reading is to organize groups of students to read collectively, and then further require the students to be able to explain the general meaning. This time, the workers' literacy textbooks one to four were read twice (because the new character book was compiled according to the literacy textbooks), and then different publications and articles were read according to the different levels of the students. Such as "Branch Life", "China Textile Workers", Korean News Agency dispatches, etc.
    The process of reading is actually the process of new characters "moving house." At the beginning, although they "read" one character at a time and couldn't read quickly, and longer sentences couldn't be read into sentences, the students were very excited to see their achievements. Especially when reading the Korean News Agency dispatch "Who Are the Most Lovable People," which had a higher ideological content and simple text, the learning mood was unprecedentedly high.
    In order to solve the difficulties in reading, the teacher should read a sentence and explain it, and explain the use and usage of punctuation marks.
    After the students were able to read preliminarily, they began to copy new characters. Before writing characters, explain the order of strokes, such as the common sense of calligraphy such as left before right, top to bottom. When they first started writing characters, the students were not used to it, and felt that they were writing poorly and slowly. This is a natural phenomenon, because they had never held a pen to write before. But their progress was very fast, for example, at the beginning, they wrote an average of two characters per minute, but later it increased to four characters, and individual students wrote up to eight characters. After writing characters for a long time, the students were very tired, so writing characters should be carried out in conjunction with reading to adjust their spirits.
    Writing sentences can train students' ability to deploy practical single characters. The experimental class spent two days learning to write sentences. The students wrote their own feelings and wrote letters to Chairman Mao reporting on their learning situation. Because they are only starting to use characters, there are still many wrong characters and typos, which need to be corrected in future learning.
    In the process of holding this experimental class, we have gained two experiences:
    I. Fully carry out ideological mobilization. At the beginning of the school, most students and some cadres were very skeptical about the rapid literacy method, and held a "try and see" attitude. For example, student Zhao Jinkai said when he first came to study, when he heard that he had to learn two thousand characters in twenty days, he said: "I have lived for forty years, worked in the People's Liberation Army for three years, and worked as a worker for more than a year, and learned sixteen characters; now you want me to learn two thousand characters in twenty days, how can that work?" Student Wang Jingqi said: "It would be good to learn phonetic symbols in twenty days." Other students also had no confidence in learning two thousand characters. In terms of cadres, some thought that it was impossible to learn two thousand characters in twenty days at all; others thought that the rapid literacy method was reasonable, but did not believe that they could recognize more than three hundred characters a day; or thought that it was possible in the army, but not necessarily in the workers? After organizing cultural grievance telling, mobilization reports, and explaining the superiority of the rapid literacy method with scientific basis, the teachers and students were consistent in their thinking. Under the influence of party members and Youth League members, learning discipline was established. And in the teaching process, various ideological problems were criticized at any time, which guaranteed the smooth implementation of learning.
    II. Several things that should be paid attention to in the teaching process: First of all, classes should be arranged according to the students' original cultural level, otherwise, those with a higher cultural level
    (faster progress) will be dragged down by those with a lower cultural level; those with a lower cultural level (slower progress) will be too tired to catch up, which will affect everyone's learning mood. Secondly, teaching must be related to reality and follow the mass line. Students can be invited to participate in the preparation of lessons and solicit opinions. At the same time, it is necessary to go deep into the masses to understand the needs of the masses, in order to correctly determine the progress of teaching. Thirdly, teaching should be combined with political current affairs. This will not only encourage students' enthusiasm for learning, but also enhance their understanding of the meaning of words. For example, when blitzing the character "响" (xiǎng, sound, echo), explaining it as the "响" (xiǎng) in "respond to Chairman Mao's call," the students felt that it was easy to remember, and the meaning of the character was also easy to understand. Fourthly, the teaching progress should be correctly grasped. For example, when learning phonetic symbols, they must be mostly learned proficiently before teaching pinyin. This time, one student did not learn the phonetic symbols proficiently, and as a result, he could not catch up when blitzing new characters. In addition, unfamiliar characters do not have to be taught strongly. In order to consolidate the achieved results, they must be taught how to use the dictionary at graduation, and assign certain review assignments, so that students can still learn on their own after returning to the factory.

    天津纺织工人速成识字法实验班的工作
    天津纺织工人速成识字法实验班班委会
    中国纺织工会全国委员会文教部和天津市委员会，在天津举办了为期一月的纺织工人速成识字法实验班。参加实验班的学员共二十九名。（男八名，女二十一名，年龄一般在二十岁左右，最小的是十七岁，最大的是四十岁）。她们原来每人平均认识五百二十一·七七个字，最高的认识一千○八十三个字，最低的认识十七个字。
    实验班从开办到结束（自一月三日到二月三日），除假期外，实际学习时间只有二十三天（一百九十五·五小时）。由于速成识字法的优越性和学员们的积极努力，学习上获得了极大的成绩。学员们从原来每人平均认识五百二十一·七七个字，提高到每人平均认识二千一百零八个字，一般都能看普通书报和写简单的短文。如原认识五百八十三个字的学员杨丽华，现在已能认识二千二百八十一个字，能读初级国语第四册、高等国语第四册和中国纺织工人杂志、朝鲜通讯、天津日报社论等，并且写了一千到一千五百字的稿子两篇。厂里的工友和干部们都羡慕地说：“你们学习以后，一定要把这方法带回来，在我们厂里推行。”
    整个教学过程，除开学时的思想动员外，分下面三个阶段：
    一、注音符号和拼音教学：注音符号是辅助识字的工具，它能够帮助学员记生字。因此，注音符号教学的好坏，会直接影响学员的学习成绩和学习情绪，关系整个教学效果。
    这次注音符号教学共用了十七·八二小时。教学步骤是按照由易到难的原则，先教介符“一メ凵”，再教声符，后教韵符，不受符号排列次序的限制。
    在注音符号旁注上图，使注音符号的音和旁边注图的形象结合起来，活泼易记，对学习帮助很大。
    在注音符号全部会认、会“搬家”（脱离注音符号排列顺序，能单独念，就叫搬家）以后，就开始拼音教学。教拼音的时候，先教单拼音，要领是“符号念什么，字就念什么”；其次教双拼音，要领是“前音轻短，后音重，拼出什么来就念什么”；最后教三拼音，要领是“先拼一、二音，再跟第三音拼”。教员先把要领详细地讲解一下，使每人都掌握了拼音要领，这在学拼音时是很重要的。这种以双拼音为基础的拼音方法，简单易学，为突击生字打下基础。
    学员掌握了拼音方法以后，可选择那些学员最熟悉及发音重而又宏亮的字，编成拼音练习表，使学员练习拼音时，大胆地肯定字音。在真正掌握了拼音要领，敢于肯定字音后，突击生字一般就没有困难了。
    二、突击生字：学会拼音后，大量突击生字就有了条件。
    突击生字是整个教学过程中最主要、最紧张的一个阶段。每一个学员都要在这短短的时间内，集中精力，突击大量生字。这次实验班用了八十一个小时，共突击了二千二百八十一个字，结果全体学员每人平均认识了二千一百零八个字（此数系根据阅读写作后的最后测定）。
    突击生字的教学步骤，分课堂教、小组复习两种。课堂教学，先由教员带领学员拼音念字两三遍，使学员熟练拼音、掌握字音。然后，讲解字义，讲时要简明生动、联系实际，以加深对字的印象。当生字突击到三分之一的时候，可解释字的部首和偏旁，以帮助学员记忆生字，并为查字典作准备工作。
    课堂教学后，即组织小组互相学习，采取互教、互学、互测、互问等方式。小组互助学习，占全部教学时间的三分之二，因此，搞好小组互助是极重要的。
    这次突击生字教学，每天教三百三十字。开始时，学员的接受能力平均每人为二百九十五字，后来就提高到三百二十二字。在这一阶段中，掌握教学进度要灵活，要及时根据学员的接受能力适当增减，不能按死板的规定。突击生字到一定时候，应以充分时间复习已学会的生字，集中力量突击难认的生字，以求巩固已经学会的生字，并继续学会全部生字。
    三、阅读和写作：在阅读、写字、写话的阶段，可以复习单字，逐步丰富已学会的字音、字义和字形，使单字结合到实际生活中去，初步实现学员掌握文化工具的要求。这个阶段，共用三百九十六小时。学习过程是阅读、写字、写话分段交叉进行的。但首先是以阅读为主，写生字写话为辅；然后集中写话。由于学员们具有丰富的生活经验，和较强的理解力，所以只要能将字连成句子，一般不需教师解释，自己即能领会其内容。
    阅读的主要方式是组织小组学员集体阅读，再进一步要求学员能讲出大意。这次是先读了工人识字课本一至四册，读了两遍（因为生字本就是按照识字课本编的），以后就根据学员们各种不同的程度读不同的刊物和文章。如“支部生活”、“中国纺织工人”、朝鲜通讯等。
    阅读的过程，实际上就是生字“搬家”的过程。开始，虽然是一个字一个字地“念”都念不快，较长的句子就念不成句，但是学员们看见了自己的成绩，情绪很高。尤其是在阅读思想性较高而文字通俗的朝鲜通讯“谁是最可爱的人”时，学习情绪空前高涨。
    为了解决阅读上的困难，教员要念一句讲一句，并说明标点符号的用处和用法。
    学员们能够初步阅读了，就开始抄写生字。写字前，先讲下笔次序，如先左后右、自上而下的书法常识。刚写字的时候，学员们不大习惯，嫌自己写得不好，写得慢。这是很自然的现象，因为他们过去没有拿笔写过字。但是他们的进步很快，如开始时每人平均每分钟写二个字，后来就提高到四个字，个别的学员写到了八个字。写字的时间长了，学员们很疲乏，因此写字要和阅读交叉进行，借以调剂精神。
    写话能锻炼学员调配实用单字的能力。实验班用了两天的时间来学习写话。学员们都写了自己的感想，写信给毛主席报告自己的学习情况。因为才开始用字，别字和错字仍不少，这需要在今后的学习中加以纠正。
    在这次举办实验班的过程中，我们取得了两点经验：
    一、充分做好思想动员工作。开学时，一般学员和有的干部对速成识字法很怀疑，抱着“试试看”的态度。如学员赵金凯在刚来学习时，听说二十几天要学会两千字，便说：“我活了四十岁，在人民解放军中作了三年工作，当了一年多的工人，学了十六个字；现在二十几天要我学会二千字，那怎么能行？”学员王景起说：“二十几天学会注音符号就算不错了。”其他学员对学会二千个字也没有信心。在干部方面，有的认为根本不可能在二十几天内学会二千字；也有的认为速成识字法是有道理的，但对一天能认识三百多字却不相信；或认为军队中可以，在工人中不见得能行吧？经过组织文化诉苦，动员报告，以科学根据阐明速成识字法的优越性后，教师、学员在思想上一致了。在党员、青年团员的影响下，建立了学习纪律。并在教学过程中，随时批评了各种思想问题，这样保证了学习的顺利推行。
    二、教学过程中应注意的几件事：首先应按照学员们原来的文化程度来编班，否则，文化程度高的
    （进度快）会被文化程度低的拖住腿；文化程度低的（进度慢）反而累得要命也赶不上，这样大家的学习情绪都会受影响。其次，讲课时必须联系实际，走群众路线。课前准备可请学员参加，征求意见。同时要深入群众，了解群众的要求，以便正确地决定教学的进度。第三，要结合政治时事进行教学。这不仅会鼓励学员的学习热情，同时可以增强他们对字义的理解。如在突击生字时，“响”，解释为“响应毛主席号召”的“响”，学员们感觉到好记，而且字义也好理解。第四，要正确掌握教学进度。如在学注音符号时，必须大部都学得熟练了，才能教拼音。这次有一个学员对注音符号没有学熟练，结果到突击生字时就赶不上了。另外，不常用的生字不必强教。为了巩固既得成绩，在毕业时，须教会查字典，布置一定的复习作业，使学员们回厂后，仍能自学。
