    Strengthening Ideological Leadership of Primary School Teachers
    Our Party and the People's Government are deeply concerned about primary education. In order to ensure that the children of the urban and rural people—especially the children of workers and peasants—can equally receive this basic education, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government clearly stipulated in the "Decision on the Reform of the School System" that a unified five-year system for primary schools would be implemented. This is to ensure that after receiving this primary education, the vast number of urban and rural children can either participate in production or pursue further studies, so that they can become creative laborers or healthy cadres of the new China.
    However, what kind of basic education are some of our children receiving? Here is an example.
    A comrade working in the army wrote from a certain village: "One day I asked a primary school student: 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' He replied: 'A businessman.' I said, 'Why do you want to be a businessman? Isn't it great to be a soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army?' He replied: 'Being a businessman can make you fat.' I asked again: 'What about farming?' He replied: 'Farming means sun, sweat, and hardship!' I asked: 'Would you like to be a village cadre?' He said: 'Village cadres only eat red sorghum buns!' I was very surprised at the time, so the next day I asked several more primary school students, but the result was that most of their answers were the same as the first primary school student!"
    Obviously, such an educational situation is completely inconsistent with the educational purpose and the desired effect of our country. We are not against "doing business," but we demand that our descendants must have a strong sense of labor. May I ask: If the ideological education we conduct for children is like the children mentioned above, who are unwilling to "sweat" and who are unwilling to be village cadres because they "eat red sorghum buns," then what kind of people will they become when they grow up? Therefore, we believe that this must arouse the vigilance and attention of the cultural and educational leadership departments at all levels in various regions—especially all primary school teachers.
    Primary school teachers are the direct educators of children. The reason why children can be infected with the decadent thoughts of the bourgeoisie, such as not working and seeking profit, is inseparable from the ideological influence of our primary school teachers. Because children always listen to the teachers, and the teachers' every move has a direct impact on them, the main responsibility for the soundness of children's thinking lies with the teachers.
    In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the cultural and educational leadership departments at all levels in various regions must correctly and systematically lead primary school teachers to conduct an ideological reform study. Although the methods can be various, the purpose should be clear, that is, to enable them to truly recognize the harm of bourgeois ideology and draw a clear line with it.

### 加强对小学教师的思想领导

    加强对小学教师的思想领导
    我们的党和人民政府是十分关怀初等教育工作的。为了保证城乡人民群众的子女——首先是工农劳动人民的子女，都能够平等地受到这种基础教育，中央人民政府政务院在“关于改革学制的决定”中，曾明确地规定实行小学修业年限为五年的一贯制。这是为了使广大的城乡儿童在受到这种初等教育以后，或者参加生产，或者升学深造，都可以成为新中国的富有创造性的劳动者或健全的干部。
    但是，我们有些儿童所受到的基础教育是怎样的呢？这里有一个例子。
    一位在部队里工作的同志从某个乡村来信说：“有一天我问一个小学生：‘你长大以后愿意作什么？’他答：‘做买卖。’我说，‘为什么要作买卖？当一个中国人民解放军的战士不是挺好吗？’他答：‘做买卖可以吃得胖胖的。’我又问：‘种庄稼怎样呢？’他答：‘种庄稼要晒太阳，流汗吃苦！’我问：‘你愿意做一个村干部吧？’他说：‘村干部还不是吃红高粱窝窝！’我当时很奇怪，于是在第二天又找了几个小学生来问，但结果，他们大部分人的回答都是和第一个小学生给我的回答一样！”
    很明显，这样的教育情况，是跟我们国家的教育宗旨和所要求的效果完全不相符合的。我们并不反对“做买卖”，但是我们要求着我们的后代必须有坚强的劳动观念。请问：如果我们对于儿童所进行的思想教育，都像上面所说的儿童那样，他们不愿意“流汗”，他们因为“吃红高粱窝窝”，而不愿意作村干部，那末，等他们一旦长大成人之后，都将会变成怎样一种人呢？因此，我们认为：这必须引起各地区各级文教领导部门——特别是所有小学教师们的警惕和注意。
    小学教师是儿童们的直接教育者。儿童们所以能够感染到那种资产阶级不劳而食、唯利是图等等的腐化堕落思想，是和我们小学教师的思想影响分不开的。因为儿童们总是听教师的话的，教师的一举一动对他们有着直接的影响，所以儿童思想的健全与否，其主要的责任是在教师们身上的。
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，各地区各级文教领导部门，都必须正确地、有组织地领导小学教师们进行一次思想改造的学习，方式虽然可以有各种各样，但目的应该是明确的，那便是使他们真正能认识到资产阶级思想的危害性，并与之划清界限。
