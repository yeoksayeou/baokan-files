    Thoroughly Investigate the Work of the Wu'an County Changzhi Automobile Transportation Company
    Editor: The state-owned Changzhi Automobile Transportation Company, Wu'an Branch, transported a batch of materials in the second half of last year. The freight for this batch of materials was more than 3.7 billion yuan. This company used deceptive means to obtain a high profit of more than 40%. The company hired vehicles from the masses, and the freight rate was 12 jin of millet per 100 jin per 100 li. However, when the company signed contracts with us, it raised the rate to 13.5 jin or 14 jin of millet. Furthermore, they arbitrarily increased the price of rice in violation of the contract: the contract stipulated that the rice price should be based on the average rice price in Changzhi and Wu'an, but the company raised the price of each jin of rice by 150 yuan or 160 yuan when settling accounts. However, when they settled accounts with the common people, the price of each jin of rice was 250 yuan lower than the price we paid.
    When we checked the accounts, we found that the company had treated cadres from our department who were responsible for transportation to meals at restaurants, and company manager Liu Zhongxuan had even bribed a certain cadre with a leather coat. There are obviously problems here. Therefore, we request the Wu'an County People's Government's Thrift and Inspection Committee to immediately thoroughly investigate the work of this company and eliminate the poison.

    彻底检查武安县长治汽车运输公司的工作
    编辑同志：国营长治汽车运输公司武安分公司在去年下半年承运一批物资。这批物资的运费是三十七亿多元。这个公司用欺骗手段，从中获得百分之四十多的高额利润。公司雇用群众的车，每百市斤百华里的运费是小米十二斤，但公司和我们订合同时，却提高到小米十三斤半或十四斤。他们又不按合同规定，任意提高米价：合同规定米价以长治、武安两地的平均米价为标准，但这个公司结算时，竟把每斤米价提高一百五十元、一百六十元不等，而他们与老百姓结账时，每斤米价则比我们所付的米价低二百五十元。
    我们清查账目时，发现这个公司曾请我部负责运输的干部吃馆子，公司经理刘中选竟贿赂某干部皮大衣一件。这里面显然是有问题的。因此，我们要求武安县人民政府节约检查委员会立即彻查这个公司的工作，清除污毒。
