Premier, esteemed members, and comrades:

The movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence among the industrial and commercial circles in Beijing has now reached the stage of implementation and handling. To bring the movement to a satisfactory conclusion, a unified standard and method of handling various types of industrial and commercial households is needed. We have formulated a "Standards and Methods for Classifying and Handling Industrial and Commercial Households in the Five-Anti Movement," and we are now submitting it to the Government Administration Council for review and approval.

This document, based on the current situation of illegal activities of private industrialists and businessmen in Beijing, specifically divides private industrial and commercial households into five categories under the five-anti targets: "law-abiding, basically law-abiding, half-law-abiding and half-law-breaking, seriously law-breaking, and completely law-breaking." Some time ago, we divided private industrial and commercial households into four categories. Now we feel that they should be divided into five categories, that is, the law-abiding household category should be changed into two categories: law-abiding households and basically law-abiding households, and the other three categories remain unchanged.

Such a division is more reasonable and can avoid deviations in specific handling. These five categories include the bourgeoisie, as well as small-bourgeois independent handicraft households and family commercial households. These independent handicraft households and family commercial households do not hire workers or shop assistants, but some families have apprentices. These industrial and commercial households account for about 19,000 of the 50,000 industrial and commercial households in Beijing, that is, about 38% of the total number of industrial and commercial households. Many of them are law-abiding, many are basically law-abiding with partial violations, some belong to the half-law-abiding and half-law-breaking category, and a very small number are seriously law-breaking. We have included them in the classification and handling during the five-anti movement, and they also request that their problems be handled.

I. Five Basic Principles for Handling Problems

In handling problems, we follow the five basic principles instructed by Chairman Mao, namely "leniency in the past, strictness in the future; leniency to the majority, strictness to the minority; leniency to those who confess, strictness to those who resist; leniency to industry, strictness to commerce; leniency to ordinary commerce, strictness to speculative commerce." Now, based on the actual situation of the Five-Anti Movement in Beijing and the provisions in the document, I will make some explanations regarding these five basic principles.

"Leniency in the past, strictness in the future." According to this principle, we stipulate that, except for those who refuse to confess and those whose circumstances are particularly serious, the illegal income from tax evasion and shoddy workmanship will generally only be compensated for 1951, and compensation for years before 1951 will be waived; other illegal acts and illegal income will generally be calculated from the date of the founding of the People's Republic of China, that is, October 1, 1949. Only the massive concealment and encroachment of enemy and puppet property will be calculated from the date of Japan's surrender. After this widespread and in-depth five-anti movement, if industrial and commercial households commit illegal acts again in the future, then most of them will be of the nature of unrepentant and recidivist, and they will be severely punished.

"Leniency to the majority, strictness to the minority." The total number of industrial and commercial households in Beijing, excluding peddlers, is 50,000. Among them, 30,000 households have illegal income of less than 2 million yuan. Among these 30,000 households, 20,000 households have illegal income of less than 500,000 yuan per household. If calculated at an average of 250,000 yuan, the total amount of illegal income of these 20,000 households is only 5 billion yuan. On the other hand, we have now found out and basically closed the cases of 1,721 households with illegal income of over 100 million yuan, with an average of about 1 billion yuan of illegal income per household. The average illegal income of every five of them is equal to the total amount of illegal income of the above-mentioned 20,000 households. From this, it can be determined that although the number of industrial and commercial households with varying degrees of illegal behavior is very large, the most rampant attacks on the state and the people, the greatest harm to the people and the state, and social undertakings (especially national defense military facilities), and the most serious and heinous nature of illegal activities are those of a small number of illegal capitalists. Therefore, it is completely reasonable to be lenient to the majority and strict to the minority.

"Leniency to those who confess, strictness to those who resist." In this document, those who thoroughly confess and report meritorious service will be treated with leniency and reduced by one level, except for those with heinous crimes; those who refuse to confess and resist the movement will be severely punished by one level, except for those with minor circumstances.

"Leniency to industry, strictness to commerce"; "Leniency to ordinary commerce, strictness to speculative commerce." For the current national economy and people's livelihood, private industry is more beneficial and less harmful than private commerce, and ordinary commerce is more beneficial and less harmful than speculative commerce. Speculative commerce is only harmful and has no benefits. Therefore, in handling, we must be realistic and treat them separately according to these two principles. These two principles, like the other principles mentioned above, run through the entire document. Some people say that we are "only considering pros and cons, not talking about right and wrong," which is not right. For the people, the relationship between the pros and cons of the national economy and the people's livelihood is also the relationship between right and wrong, and the two are completely consistent.

II. Basic Standards for Classifying Five Types of Private Industrial and Commercial Households

The basic standard for classification is whether there are illegal acts and the severity of the illegal acts, and the heinousness of the illegal nature. For example, those classified as law-abiding households are estimated to have no illegal acts based on the government's existing materials and their own undertakings. Those classified as basically law-abiding households are basically law-abiding but have some illegal acts, and their illegal income is generally less than 2 million yuan, and their illegal acts are mainly tax evasion and shoddy workmanship of a minor nature. Those listed as seriously law-breaking households and completely law-breaking households are different. Their illegal acts have serious harm to the state and the people or have extremely serious harm, or are of other extremely heinous nature. The main boundary between seriously law-breaking and completely law-breaking is: the illegal acts of seriously law-breaking households have not reached the level of completely law-breaking, and they still have some law-abiding aspects; completely law-breaking households do not have any law-abiding components. Between these law-abiding households, basically law-abiding households, and seriously law-breaking households and completely law-breaking households are the half-law-abiding and half-law-breaking households.

Another standard for classification is whether the illegal industrial and commercial households adopt an attitude of confessing and repenting in the five-anti movement or an attitude of refusing to confess and being incorrigible.

According to the standards set in this document and the preliminary materials we have now, among the 50,000 private industrial and commercial households in Beijing, there are about 5,000 law-abiding households, accounting for about 10%; 30,000 basically law-abiding households, accounting for about 60%; 12,500 half-law-abiding and half-law-breaking households, accounting for about 25%; 2,000 seriously law-breaking households, accounting for about 4%; and 500 completely law-breaking households, accounting for about 1%. Among the completely law-breaking households, they can be divided into two parts: one part has thoroughly confessed during the trial and is willing to perform meritorious service to redeem their sins, and can be fined after paying taxes and returning property without being sentenced; the other part must be sentenced.

III. Handling of Bribery Issues

In this five-anti movement, it was found that many industrial and commercial households in Beijing had bribery behavior. Excluding small rebates that are not considered bribery, and those who are extorted without illegal income are not considered bribery, there are still 13,087 households, accounting for about 26% of the industrial and commercial households, who have bribery behavior. Among them, 169 households bribed more than 100 million yuan, 172 households bribed 50 million to 100 million yuan, 195 households bribed 30 million to 50 million yuan, 642 households bribed 10 million to 30 million yuan, 3,161 households bribed 1 million to 10 million yuan, and 8,748 households bribed less than 1 million yuan. The nature of bribery is serious and must be dealt with seriously. If only a few people are punished and most people are not punished, it will be too lenient; if everyone is punished, then the number of people punished will be too many. Therefore, we have decided that those who have minor bribery circumstances will not be fined, let alone sentenced, but will be given a warning as a sign of seriousness. If they commit the crime again in the future, they will be severely punished. Those who have other bribery behaviors will be fined according to their circumstances; those who refuse to confess will have their fines increased; those with particularly serious circumstances will be severely punished.

IV. Time of Application of This Document

The standards and methods for handling private industrial and commercial households proposed in this document only apply to this five-anti movement. This is a temporary disposal method suitable for large-scale social reform movements. After the end of the movement, everything should still be handled according to regular laws and regulations. For example, in terms of tax evasion, those who evade taxes on weekdays are fined less than five times, less than ten times, or less than thirty times according to their tax types and the amount of tax evaded; and what is stipulated in this document is that, in fact, those who voluntarily confess "only compensate, no fine," and only compensate for 1951. This kind of disposal is naturally the most lenient. But because it is combined with the movement of the broad masses, and it is dealing with the problems that the masses have actually solved or basically solved in the movement, therefore, it is the most effective and serious. It relies on the vigorous movement of the broad masses to solve the problems that could not be solved for a long time on weekdays in a short period of time. It is a revolutionary disposal and must not be judged by ordinary laws.

The purpose of the five-anti movement is to repel the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie, ban their illegal and transgressive behaviors, transform their thinking, make them strictly abide by the laws of the People's Government, honestly move forward along the path of new democracy, and no longer have illegal, transgressive, or contrary behaviors. This document is formulated according to this spirit.

### 北京市长彭真三月八日在政务院会议上的报告

专栏：

    北京市长彭真三月八日在政务院会议上的报告总理、各位委员、各位同志：
    在北京市工商界中进行反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的运动，现在已到了实行处理的阶段。为了使运动完满结束，需要对各类工商户有一个统一的处理标准和办法。我们制定了一个“在五反运动中关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法”，现在报请政务会议加以审查批准。
    这个文件根据北京市目前已查明的私人工商业者违法的情况，在五反目标下，将私人工商户具体划分为“守法的、基本守法的、半守法半违法的、严重违法的和完全违法的”五类。前些日子我们曾将私人工商户划分为四类，现在觉得应分为五类，即将守法户一类改为守法户和基本守法户两类，其他三类不变。
    这样的划分，更合理些，可以避免在具体处理时发生偏差。这五类包括资产阶级，也包括小资产阶级的独立手工业户和家庭商业户。这些独立手工业户和家庭商业户不雇工人店员，但有些人家带了学徒，这种工商户在北京市五万工商户中约占了一万九千户，即约占工商户总数百分之三十八左右。他们中有许多是守法的，也有许多是基本守法部分违法的，也有少数是属于半守法半违法的，并有极少数是严重违法的。我们在五反中分类处理时，是把他们包括在内的，他们也要求对他们的问题加以处理。
    一、关于处理问题的五条基本原则
    我们处理问题，是根据毛主席所指示的五条基本原则，即“过去从宽，今后从严；多数从宽，少数从严；坦白从宽，抗拒从严；工业从宽，商业从严；普通商业从宽，投机商业从严”。现在我就北京市五反运动的实际情况和文件中的规定，对于这五条基本原则作若干说明。
    “过去从宽，今后从严”。根据这条原则，我们规定除了拒不坦白和情节特别严重者外，偷税漏税、偷工减料两项违法所得，一般只补退一九五一年的，一九五一年以前的免予补退；其他各项违法行为和违法所得，一般自中华人民共和国成立之日，即一九四九年十月一日算起。只对大量隐匿侵吞敌伪财产，从日本投降之日算起。经过了这次普遍深入的五反运动，如果今后工商户再有违法行为，那就多半是属于不知悔改和累犯的性质，就要从严处理了。
    “多数从宽，少数从严”。北京市工商户除摊贩外，总数是五万户。其中有三万户，其违法所得均在二百万元以下。在这三万户中又有两万户的违法所得每户在五十万元以下。如平均以二十五万元计算，这两万户的违法所得总额不过五十亿元。另一方面，我们现在已经查出并且大体结案的一亿以上的违法户是一、七二一户，每户的违法所得平均约十亿。他们每五户的平均违法所得即等于上述两万户违法所得的总额。从这里可以判明，有不同程度的违法行为的工商户，虽然数目很大，但向国家人民进攻最猖狂，对人民和国家、社会事业（特别是国防军事设施）危害最大、违法性质严重恶劣的，却是其中的少数不法资本家。因此，对多数从宽，对少数从严，是完全合乎情理的。
    “坦白从宽，抗拒从严”。在这个文件中，对于彻底坦白、检举立功的，除罪大恶极者外，都从宽减轻一级处理；凡拒不坦白、抗拒运动的，除情节轻微者外，均从严加重一级处理。
    “工业从宽，商业从严”；“普通商业从宽，投机商业从严”。对于当前的国计民生来说，私营工业较私营商业利处较多害处较少，普通商业较投机商业又利处较多害处较少。投机商业只有害处，没有好处。因此，在处理时，必须实事求是，按照这两条原则，加以分别对待。这两条原则也和上述其他原则一样，是贯穿着整个文件的。有人说我们是
    “只计利害，不讲是非”，这是不对的。对于人民来讲，对于国计民生的利害关系，同时就是是非关系，二者是完全一致的。
    二、关于五类私人工商户划分的基本标准
    分类的基本标准，是有无违法行为及其违法行为的轻重大小，违法性质的恶劣程度。例如划入守法户的，是根据政府已有材料和他们本人的具结，估计没有违法行为的。被划入基本守法户的是基本守法而有部分违法行为的，其违法所得，一般在二百万元以下，其违法行为主要是偷税漏税和性质轻微的偷工减料。列入严重违法户和完全违法户的则不同，他们的违法行为是对国家人民有严重的危害作用或有极严重的危害作用，或其他性质极为恶劣的。其中严重违法和完全违法的主要界限是：严重违法户的违法行为还没有到完全违法的程度，他们还有部分守法的一方面；完全违法户则没有任何守法的成分。介乎这守法户、基本守法户与严重违法户、完全违法户之间的就是半守法半违法户。
    分类的另一个标准，就是违法工商户在五反运动中是采取坦白悔改的态度还是采取拒不坦白怙恶不悛的态度。
    根据这个文件中所定的标准和我们现在已有的初步材料来划分，北京市私人工商户五○、○○○户中，约有守法的五、○○○户，即占百分之十左右；基本守法的三○、○○○户，即占百分之六十左右；半守法半违法的一二、五○○户，即占百分之二十五左右；严重违法的二、○○○户，即占百分之四左右；完全违法的五○○户，即占百分之一左右。在完全违法户中，又可分为两部分：一部分在审讯中已彻底坦白并愿立功赎罪，最后于补税退财外可以酌判罚金，而不必判刑；另一部分则须判刑。
    三、关于行贿问题的处理
    在此次五反运动中，发现北京市有很多工商户有行贿行为。除掉小额回扣不算行贿，被勒索而无违法所得者也不算行贿以外，尚有一万三千零八十七户，即约占百分之二十六的工商户有行贿行为。其中行贿一亿元以上者一百六十九户，五千万元至一亿元者一百七十二户，三千万元至五千万元者一百九十五户，一千万元至三千万元者六百四十二户，一百万元至一千万元者三千一百六十一户，一百万元以下者八千七百四十八户。行贿性质严重，必须严肃处理。如果只处罚少数人而对多数人不予处罚，则失之过宽；如果一律处罚，则受罚的人又将过多。因此，我们决定对于行贿情节轻微的，拟不科罚金，更不判刑，但须给予警告处分，以示严肃。以后再犯，则将从重处理。对于其他有行贿行为的，则按其情节处以罚金；拒不坦白的加重其罚金；对于情节特别严重者，则加重处刑。
    四、这个文件适用的时间
    这个文件中所提出的关于私人工商户处理的标准和办法，仅仅适用于此次五反运动中。这是一种适合于大规模的社会改革运动中的临时处置办法。在运动结束后，一切仍应按照经常的法规办事。例如以偷税漏税来说，平日偷税者，是按其税种和漏税额处以五倍以下、十倍以下或三十倍以下的罚金；而在本文件中所规定的，实际上凡自动坦白者“只补不罚”，而且是只补一九五一年的。这种处置自然是再宽大不过了。但因为它是和广大群众的运动相结合的，它所处理的又是运动中群众已经实际解决或基本解决了的问题，因此，它是最有效而且最严肃的。它依靠广大群众的轰轰烈烈的运动，在短短的期间解决了平日很久不能解决的问题，它是一种革命的处置，决不能绳之以常法。
    五反运动的目的，是在于打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，取缔他们违法越轨的行为，改造他们的思想，使他们严格遵守人民政府的法令，老老实实地沿着新民主主义的道路前进，而不再有违法越轨或背道而驰的行为。这个文件就是根据这样的精神来制定的。
