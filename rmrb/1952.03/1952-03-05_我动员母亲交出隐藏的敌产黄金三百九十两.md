    I Mobilized My Mother to Surrender 390 Taels of Hidden Enemy Property Gold

    Editor: I am a female student at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. During this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, my thinking has taken a step forward. I have recognized the harm of bourgeois ideology to the people's cause. At the beginning of the movement, I thought I must deeply examine my own thoughts, eliminate the toxins of bourgeois ideology, and resolutely report the corrupt acts of others.

    My father, Zhang Lanfeng, was a traitor who also served as the commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang puppet Henan Third Route Army. My mother was staying at the home of a friend named Chen Kaiting. One day, my mother said to me in a panic: "Chen Kaiting has been reported as a corrupt element." I thought Chen Kaiting might be corrupt. I explained to her the people's government's policy of "not wronging a good person, nor letting go of a bad person," and asked her to mobilize Chen Kaiting to confess voluntarily. Then my mother said, "Chen Kaiting is not only worried about his own problems, but also worried about the things I have placed at his place." I immediately asked my mother what she had placed at Chen Kaiting's place. She had many concerns at the time and said hesitantly, "A few clothing boxes." Hearing her say this, I stopped asking. That day, my mother never said what she wanted to say but dared not say.

    The next day, my younger sister rushed from home to tell me: "What Mom placed at Chen Kaiting's place is the gold left by our reactionary father." She also wanted me to find a way to deal with it. At that time, I thought this was a test for me, and I must stand firm, report this matter to the organization, and seek the organization's opinion on how to handle it. I also asked my sister to go home and mobilize my mother to confess.

    After the organization learned about this matter, they helped me think of some ways to mobilize my mother. I went home to mobilize her several times. At first, she still had many concerns. She asked me if there would be a crime in handing over this gold. I told her, "As long as you explain the problem clearly, the people will be lenient with you; if you confess, you can drop a great mental burden." When I asked her how much gold there was, she only said a lot. I said to my mother, "Hiding so much property of counter-revolutionaries is a criminal act, and it must be handed over to the country and the people." After my repeated explanations, she also felt that she should not fail to hand it over. Finally, she told me that she had hidden a total of thirty-nine gold bars, weighing three hundred and ninety taels. I was extremely happy after my mother confessed. I excitedly returned to school, told the organization about these things, and asked the organization to find a way to deal with it immediately. Within a few days, the organization notified me that this property of the people had been handed over to the People's Court and returned to the hands of the people.

    Through this test, my thinking has taken a step forward. I deeply feel the warmth of the organization towards me, and I feel that only under the education of the Communist Party can I be trained to be stronger!

    我动员母亲交出隐藏的敌产黄金三百九十两
    编辑同志：我是中央美术学院的一个女学生。在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，我的思想提高了一步。我认清了资产阶级思想对人民事业的危害性。在运动开始时，我想我必须深刻检查自己的思想，肃清资产阶级思想的毒素，并坚决检举别人的贪污行为。
    我的父亲张岚峰是一个汉奸，也曾做过国民党伪河南第三路军总司令。我的母亲寄居在名叫陈凯庭的朋友家里。有一天母亲恐慌地对我说：“陈凯庭被人检举是一个贪污分子。”我想陈凯庭是有贪污的可能的。我就把人民政府“不冤枉一个好人，也不放过一个坏人”的政策讲给母亲听，并请她去动员陈凯庭自动坦白。接着母亲说：“陈凯庭不但担忧他自己的问题，而且担忧我放在他那里的东西。”我马上追问母亲放在陈凯庭那里的是什么东西。她当时顾虑很多，吞吞吐吐地说：“几只衣服箱子。”我听她这么一说，我不再追问了。这一天，母亲一直都没有说出她想说而又不敢说的话。
    第二天，我的妹妹从家里赶来告诉我说：“妈妈放在陈凯庭那里的东西是反动的父亲留下的金子。”她并且要我设法处理。当时我想这是考验我的时候了，我一定要坚定立场，把这件事情报告给组织，并且征求组织对这件事情的处理意见。我并让妹妹回家动员母亲坦白。
    组织方面知道了这件事情，就帮助我想了一些办法去动员母亲。我曾经回家动员她好几次，起初她的顾虑还是很多。她问我交出这些金子有没有罪，我告诉她说：“只要把问题交代清楚，人民对你是会宽大处理的；你坦白了，就可以丢下了一个精神上的大包袱。”当我问她有多少金子时，她只说很多。我就对母亲说：“隐藏这样多的反革命分子的财产，是一种犯罪的行为，必须把它交给国家和人民。”经过我反复解说，她也觉得不应该不交出来。最后她告诉我，共隐藏金子三十九条，重三百九十两。母亲坦白以后，我高兴极了。我兴奋地回到学校，把这些事情告诉了组织，并请组织马上设法处理。没有几天，组织通知我，这些人民的财产已交到人民法院，回到人民的手中来了。
    通过这一考验，我的思想提高了一步。我深深地感觉到组织对我的温暖，我觉得只有在共产党的教育下，才能锻炼得更坚强！
