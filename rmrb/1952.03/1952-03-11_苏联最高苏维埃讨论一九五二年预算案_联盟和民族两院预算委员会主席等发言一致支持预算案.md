Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 10th: According to TASS, the Union Chamber and the Nationalities Chamber of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union met separately on the 7th to discuss the report by Soviet Finance Minister Zverev on the Soviet Union's 1952 national budget.

    At the meeting of the Union Chamber, Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Andreyev, Khrushchev, Shvernik, Suslov, and Ponomarin were warmly welcomed by all the representatives when they appeared on the government dais.

    Chairman of the Budget Committee of the Union Chamber, Kornyets, pointed out in his report: The Budget Committee believes that the 1952 budget is completely based on the planned development of the national economy. The portion of the 1952 budget revenue derived from the people is less than that of 1951, accounting for only slightly more than 9 percent of the budget. The Budget Committee recommends that the national budget be approved according to the figures passed by the Council of Ministers, and that certain revisions be made to its revenue side.

    Those who spoke in the discussion included: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian Republic, Korotchenko; President of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian Republic, Ambartsumian; as well as representatives from Belarus, Georgia, Latvia, and Moscow, Leningrad, Kuibyshev, Voronezh, and other places. They all unanimously supported the 1952 budget proposal and believed that it conformed to the vital interests of the Soviet people. The smooth implementation of the budget will guarantee the further strengthening of the Soviet Union's national strength.

    The Chairman of the Budget Committee of the Nationalities Chamber, Kokhalov, delivered a report at the meeting of the Nationalities Chamber. On behalf of the Budget Committee, he proposed that the draft national budget be approved and put forward an amendment proposing to increase the state budget revenue by 1.092 billion rubles.

    Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Chernousov; Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Latvian Republic, Lacis; Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Moldavian Republic, Rud; and representatives from Belarus, the Kazakh Republic, and the Mari and Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Republics, successively spoke at the meeting, supporting the proposal to approve this year's budget proposal and the Budget Committee's amendments.

    The meetings of the two chambers will continue to be held separately on the 8th.
