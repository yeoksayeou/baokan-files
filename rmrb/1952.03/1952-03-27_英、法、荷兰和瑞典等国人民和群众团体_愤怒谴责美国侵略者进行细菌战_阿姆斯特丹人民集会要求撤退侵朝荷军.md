Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: People, mass organizations, and peace movements in countries such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands continue to protest against the crime of germ warfare by American imperialism.

According to TASS: The National Council of the British-Soviet Friendship Society passed a resolution condemning the germ warfare waged by American imperialism in Korea. The resolution stated: Regarding this germ warfare, an international investigation team composed of experienced jurists has issued a shocking communique. The resolution also pointed out the following facts indicating that American imperialism deliberately engaged in germ warfare: First, the United States is the only major power besides Japan that refuses to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting germ warfare. Second, Truman deliberately withdrew the Geneva Protocol, along with many other unapproved treaties, from the Senate. Third, the United States refuses to hand over the senior Japanese political and military figures responsible for germ warfare, as judged by the Khabarovsk Tribunal in December 1949, as war criminals. Fourth, Professor Rosebury's book "Peace or Pestilence," published in 1949, revealed that the American authorities had already begun experimenting with bacteriological weapons between 1941 and 1942. Fifth, since 1945, American newspapers and magazines have repeatedly published articles boasting about the United States' preparations for this method of warfare.

The French people continue to protest the heinous crimes of American aggressors launching germ warfare in Korea and China. "L'Humanité" published a telegram from sixty Parisian lawyers to the United Nations and a telegram to the President of the China Political Science and Law Society. These sixty lawyers expressed their indignant protest against the savage crime of the United States using bacteriological weapons, demanding "immediate and severe punishment of these criminals, and public condemnation of this crime against peace and humanity." According to "L'Humanité", many personnel from the Biological Laboratory of the National Scientific Research Institute in Gif-sur-Yvette (Seine-et-Oise) signed a protest against the use of bacteriological weapons. French biologists exposed the criminal activities of American sham scientists, pointing out that they cooperated with Japanese war criminal Shiro Ishii and Nazi Schleibb to manufacture and continue to manufacture bacteriological weapons.

The Peace Committee of Amsterdam, Netherlands, held a large mass meeting on March 21st, with participants from all parties and factions. The meeting decided to submit a protest to the Dutch government and the United Nations, demanding an end to the germ warfare in Korea and the withdrawal of all Dutch troops from Korea. On the same day, several hundred working people held a demonstration in The Hague, protesting against the crime of American aggressors conducting germ warfare in Korea and China. The demonstrators marched through the streets, holding signs with slogans such as: "Down with Germ Warfare," "Strive for Peace in Korea," and "Punish War Criminals." The police attacked the demonstrators several times, but failed to stop many of them from reaching the American Embassy, where they handed over a written protest against the recent atrocities of the United States. Two hundred shipyard workers in Amsterdam also submitted a written protest to the American Embassy in The Hague, protesting against the American crime of conducting germ warfare in Korea and China. Many groups throughout the Netherlands, the entire staff of many factories, and cultural figures have sent telegrams and statements to the United Nations and the American Embassy in The Hague. Professors, doctors, and other staff members of the Amsterdam Central Hospital wrote to the United Nations, stating: "Our duty is to reduce the suffering of the people, and we express our contempt and opposition to those American 'scientists' who use their knowledge to destroy human life. We demand that the American criminals who launched germ warfare against the Korean and Chinese people be severely punished. It is time to stop these unreasonable aggressors."

A grand rally was held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, and the participants telegraphed the US government to protest the use of bacteriological weapons by American aggressors in Korea and Northeast China. The telegram said: We are very indignant when we learn that your military headquarters in Korea is using bacteriological weapons against the Korean people. We express our anger and protest. We demand: "Do not interfere in Korea."

Finnish democratic newspapers reported the news that Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, issued a statement calling on all countries of the world to severely condemn the heinous crimes of American imperialists in conducting germ warfare. Professor Iversen, Chairman of the Finnish Peace Union and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Finnish Peace Congress, has telegraphed Raphael, Secretary-General of the World Peace Council, expressing his support for Joliot-Curie's statement.

Lyssarides, Chairman of the Cyprus Peace Committee, telegraphed the World Peace Council, representing the people of Cyprus, to express deep indignation at the recent American crime of conducting germ warfare, and said: The people of Cyprus will use every opportunity to condemn this measure and the criminals who launched this inhumane and brutal act.

    【新华社二十六日讯】英、法、荷兰等国家的人民、群众团体与和平运动组织继续抗议美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行。
    据塔斯社讯：英苏友好协会全国理事会通过了一项决议，谴责美帝国主义在朝鲜进行的细菌战。决议说：关于这一细菌战，经验丰富的法学家组成的国际调查团，已经发表了一篇令人震惊的公报。决议并指出下列几件表明美帝国主义蓄意进行细菌战的事实：一、除日本外，美国是拒绝批准禁止细菌战的一九二五年日内瓦议定书的唯一大国。二、杜鲁门故意把日内瓦议定书连同其他许多未经批准的条约从参议院中撤回。三、美国拒绝把一九四九年十二月伯力法庭所判决的应对细菌战负责的日本高级政治与军事人物作为战犯移交出来。四、一九四九年出版的罗兹伯里教授所著题为“和平或是瘟疫”的书，揭露美国当局在一九四一年到一九四二年间就已开始试验细菌武器。五、从一九四五年起，美国书报杂志中曾一再刊载吹嘘美国进行这种战争方法的准备工作的文章。
    法国人民继续抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国发动细菌战的滔天罪行。“人道报”刊载了巴黎六十位律师给联合国的电报和给中国政治法律学会主席的电报。这六十位律师表示忿怒抗议美国生番使用细菌武器的罪行，要求“立即严厉惩罚这些罪犯，并公开斥责这种反对和平和人道的罪行”。据“人道报”消息，治夫苏伊维特（塞纳—瓦斯省）国立科学研究院生物实验室的许多人员都在一个抗议书上签了名，抗议使用细菌武器。法国生物学家揭露美国冒牌科学家的罪恶活动，指出他们和日本战犯石井四郎和纳粹分子施莱勃合作，制造了并且仍在继续制造着细菌武器。
    荷兰阿姆斯特丹市的和平委员会在三月二十一日举行了一个人数众多的群众大会，各党各派都有人参加。大会决定向荷兰政府与联合国提出抗议，要求终止在朝鲜进行的细菌战，并从朝鲜撤退所有荷兰军队。在同一天，有好几百个劳动人民在海牙举行示威，抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行。示威者穿过街道，举着标语牌，标语牌上写着：“打倒细菌战”、“争取朝鲜和平”、“惩办战争罪犯”等标语。警察向示威者进行了好几次袭击，可是并没有制止得住许多示威者到达美国大使馆，示威者把对美国最近这种暴行的书面抗议交给了美国大使馆。阿姆斯特丹二百个造船工人也向海牙美国大使馆提出书面抗议，抗议美国在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行。荷兰全国许多团体、许多工厂的全体职工和文化界人士纷纷向联合国及美国驻海牙大使馆发出电报和声明。阿姆斯特丹中央医院的教授们、医生们和其他工作人员致函联合国，其中说：“我们的职责是减少人民的痛苦，我们对那些把他们的知识用在毁灭人类生命的美国‘科学家们’表示鄙视和反对。我们要求严惩那些对朝鲜和中国人民发动细菌战的美国罪犯们。现在是制止这些蛮不讲理的侵略者的时候了。”
    瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩举行了一次盛大的集会，到会的人打电报给美国政府，抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器。该电说：我们在获悉朝鲜境内你们的军事司令部对朝鲜人民使用细菌武器时，非常愤慨。我们表示愤怒和抗议。我们要求：“不要干涉朝鲜。”
    芬兰的民主报纸报道了世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里发表声明号召世界各国严厉谴责美帝国主义者进行细菌战的滔天罪行的消息。芬兰和平联盟主席、芬兰保卫和平大会常设委员会副主席伊维尔逊教授已经打电报给世界和平理事会秘书长拉斐德，表示拥护约里奥—居里的声明。
    塞浦路斯和平委员会主席李沙里迪斯打电报给世界和平理事会，代表塞浦路斯人民，对美国最近进行细菌战的罪行表示深切的愤慨，并说：塞浦路斯人民将利用一切机会斥责这种措施，并斥责发动这种违反人道的残暴行动的罪犯们。
