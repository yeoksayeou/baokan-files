    Letters from Farmers Across the Country to This Newspaper:
    Vow to Extinguish American Germ Warfare with Practical Action
    —Excerpts from Readers' Letters

    This newspaper continues to receive letters from a broad readership expressing their determination to extinguish the germ warfare launched by the United States. We are now publishing excerpts from some farmers' letters as follows:

    Chen Yongkang, a model for rice production in 1951, and Gu Berlin, the vice-leader of his mutual aid team, along with team members Gu Yougen, Gu Fulin, Chen Shaoliang, Xue Yonglin, and Chen Liangcai, jointly wrote a letter to this newspaper to be forwarded to mutual aid teams across the country and to our farmer brothers and sisters nationwide, saying: "Just as we are intensely preparing for spring plowing, the American invaders are wantonly spreading germ-carrying insects in Korea and northeastern China. The atrocities of the American invaders have further aroused our hatred. We are determined to transform our hatred into strength, and together with mutual aid teams across the country and our farmer brothers and sisters, we will overcome all difficulties on the production front, do a good job in drought prevention and resistance, and spring plowing, launch patriotic production increase campaigns, and support the Volunteer Army with fruitful harvests, giving the American invaders a fatal blow. In addition, we guarantee to do a good job in epidemic prevention and sanitation. We hope that our farmer brothers and sisters across the country will also do a good job in epidemic prevention and sanitation. We believe: We will surely extinguish the poisonous flames of the American invaders' germ warfare." Liu Yuliang, Liu Chunhua, Li Guangtian and others wrote: "All the farmers in Yuanzhuang Village, Zhuolu County, Chahar Province, are protesting the towering crimes of the American invaders spreading germs with practical actions. They have decided to advance the spring gathering and sowing of all 508 mu of land in the village; guarantee more hoeing, more fertilizer, careful cultivation, and strive to increase the yield of millet by 96 jin per mu; for long-term drought prevention, they have decided to dig four new wells, repair three old wells, and repair 15 canals, guaranteeing completion before March 25; and guarantee that the crops of all seven families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers will have a bumper harvest. Thirty young male and female farmers in the village, including Han Liang and Guo Yumei, have sworn: to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and go to the front line of anti-bacterial warfare to directly counter the provocations of the American invaders." Wu Lianjiang and all staff members of the Hebei Province Huolu County Farm wrote: "In order to crush the conspiracy of the American invaders to launch germ warfare with practical actions, we are determined to strengthen technical learning, improve work efficiency, guarantee to increase yield per unit area, and take the lead in participating in the county-wide 'Thousand Villages and Ten Thousand Groups Production Increase Campaign' to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army."
