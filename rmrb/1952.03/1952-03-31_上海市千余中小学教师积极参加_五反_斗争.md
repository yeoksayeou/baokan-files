The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and the Shanghai Educational Workers' Union convened a conference on March 24th at the Shanghai Gymnasium, gathering principals, academic affairs directors, political teachers, current affairs and policy teachers from Shanghai's municipal public and private secondary schools, vocational evening schools, supplementary schools, as well as principals and academic affairs directors from public and private primary schools. At the meeting, Chen Xiangping, Director of the Shanghai Educational Workers' Branch Office of the East China Learning Committee, conveyed the spirit and key points of the city's "Five-Anti" study plan for teachers.

In order to ensure that Shanghai's educational workers are trained and transformed in the great "Five-Anti" struggle, the Shanghai education sector has organized a team of 1,800 people to actively participate in the "Five-Anti" struggle. In addition, the vast majority of teachers in the city have decided to conduct "Five-Anti" propaganda work to neighborhood residents in their spare time under the unified leadership of the Shanghai Educational Workers' "Five-Anti" Propaganda Brigade. All the teachers in the city have taken action, warmly responding to the call of the People's Government and Mayor Chen Yi, and throwing themselves into the "Five-Anti" struggle.

At 9:00 AM on March 25th, the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Educational Workers' Branch of the East China Learning Committee held a meeting, where it was decided: In order to thoroughly expose the ugly and decadent nature of the bourgeoisie and their rampant attacks, as well as the serious harm they cause to the people and the country, to clearly understand the policies and guidelines of the "Five-Anti" struggle, to raise class consciousness, to draw a clear line between the ideology of the working class and the bourgeoisie, to clarify our stand, and to establish the leading ideology of the working class, it was decided to launch a systematic "Five-Anti" study among teachers. This study must be closely linked to reality, such as exposing and reporting the crimes of corrupt elements and illegal capitalists. The study time should be at least eight hours per week, with one discussion session of more than three hours. At the same time, schools at all levels in Shanghai began to systematically conduct "Five-Anti" education for students. The first stage stipulates that emphasis should be placed on exposing the ungrateful behavior of the bourgeoisie through irrefutable concrete examples, so that students can experience the noble qualities of the working class; in addition, it should be explained from the crimes of illegal capitalists such as destroying the Common Program, undermining the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, undermining economic construction, undermining the daily interests of the broad masses of people, and corrupting state cadres, that we must resolutely launch a counterattack against the bourgeoisie, so that students can receive a profound patriotic education and love their motherland more.

    上海市千余中小学教师积极参加“五反”斗争
    上海市人民政府教育局、上海市教育工作者工会为了开展“五反”运动的宣传教育工作，曾于三月二十四日召集了上海市市属公私立中等学校、职工业余学校、补习学校的校长、教导主任、政治教师、时事政策教师及公私立小学校长、教导主任等在上海市体育馆举行大会。在会上，华东学习委员会上海市教育工作者分会办公室陈向平主任传达了全市教师“五反”学习计划的精神和要点。
    为了使上海市教育工作者在伟大的“五反”斗争中受到锻炼和改造，上海市教育界已经组织了一支一千八百人的队伍，积极参加“五反”斗争。此外，全市广大的教师群众决定在上海市教育工作者“五反”宣传大队统一领导下，利用业余时间，向里弄居民进行“五反”斗争的宣传工作。全市教师已一致行动起来，热烈响应人民政府和陈毅市长的号召，投身到“五反”的斗争中。
    三月二十五日上午九时，华东学习委员会上海市教育工作者分会召开了常务委员会议，会上决定：为了在教师中彻底揭露资产阶级丑恶腐朽的本质及其猖狂进攻的罪行对人民和国家的严重危害性，明确认识“五反”斗争的政策方针，提高阶级觉悟，划清工人阶级和资产阶级的思想界线，明确立场，确定工人阶级的领导思想，决定在教师中展开有系统的“五反”学习。此次学习必须认真联系实际，如揭露和检举贪污分子和违法资本家罪行等。学习时间每星期至少要有八小时，并应有一次三小时以上的讨论时间。同时，上海市属各级学校开始有系统地对同学进行“五反”教育。第一阶段规定着重在通过无可辩驳的具体事例，揭露资产阶级忘恩负义的行为，从而使同学体验工人阶级大公无私的高贵品质；另外并应从违法资本家破坏共同纲领、破坏抗美援朝、破坏经济建设、破坏广大人民日常利益、腐蚀国家干部等罪行中，说明我们必须坚决向资产阶级展开反攻，使同学受到深刻的爱国主义教育，更加热爱自己的祖国。
