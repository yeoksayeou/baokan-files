Comprehensive Drought Prevention Campaign Launched in North and East China

Localities must conscientiously implement production and drought prevention policies, strengthen the supply of materials for spring plowing and drought prevention, and overcome the passive waiting and "change of shift" mentality of district and village cadres.

After the establishment of provincial-level production and drought prevention offices in the provinces of North China, drought prevention work in the entire North China region has rapidly and comprehensively unfolded. In Hebei Province, the prefecture-level production and drought prevention offices in ten prefectures have all been established, and meetings have been held separately, including expanded meetings in Tangshan, Cangxian, and Hengshui prefectures. Each prefecture has also dispatched dozens to hundreds of cadres to form inspection teams to go deep into the counties to promote the work. Currently, counties throughout the province are holding expanded meetings attended by district and village cadres to arrange drought prevention and spring plowing work. From February 21st to 24th, the People's Government of Chahar Province convened a meeting of responsible cadres from various prefectures and counties to discuss drought prevention, production, and disaster relief, determining that drought prevention is the current central task, and that March is a month of concentrated effort for drought prevention, spring plowing, and disaster relief. It requires all counties to complete the meetings by the end of February, disseminate drought prevention, spring plowing, and disaster relief work to the villages, and organize a 5,800-member shock team of cadres at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels, starting from March 1st, to extensively and vigorously carry out drought prevention, spring plowing, and disaster relief work. From February 25th, Suiyuan Province convened a meeting of responsible cadres from prefectures, counties, and banners to arrange agricultural production, livestock protection, disaster relief, and epidemic prevention work. The party and government leading organs of Shanxi Province organized 28 cadres on February 18th to go to various prefectures to inspect work; and decided to designate the period from the end of February to March 6th as a production and drought prevention publicity week. The Yuncheng, Changzhi, Linfen, Xinzhou, and Yuci prefectures and more than 20 counties including Gaoping and Lingchuan in Shanxi have established production and drought prevention offices, and the masses in many areas have taken action. As of February 24th, in Pingyuan Province, except for the Huxi Prefecture, other prefectures and counties have established production and drought prevention offices; the provincial inspection team departed on February 26th to inspect work in various prefectures. The entire province proposed to ensure the completion of three tasks: spring sowing, wheat harvesting, and summer sowing, and formulated a plan to develop more than 6 million mu of water conservancy, ensuring that even in the event of severe drought, 10 million mu of land, including existing irrigated land, can still achieve normal harvests.

The East China Spring Plowing Production Office was established on February 22nd, with Cheng Zhaoxuan, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of the East China Military and Political Committee, serving as director. Inspection teams have been dispatched to Shandong, southern Anhui, northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian. Offices in various provinces and regions have been established in late February, and inspection teams have been dispatched separately. Prefecture-level offices in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, and Zhejiang have been established and are urging counties to establish organizations by the end of February and early March to go deep into various areas to work. On February 26th, the Shandong Provincial People's Government convened an expanded mobilization meeting, requiring all levels below the county to fully transition to the production and drought prevention campaign starting from March 1st.

At present, all localities must conscientiously implement the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Ensuring the Implementation of the Decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Preventing and Combating Drought" and the "Decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Vigorously Launching a Mass Drought Prevention and Resistance Campaign," and pay attention to solving the following three problems:

1.  In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, the business of many economic departments in various localities has stagnated. After the launch of the drought prevention and resistance campaign, they have not fully taken action, affecting the supply of materials needed for spring plowing and the acquisition of local products. Leading organs in various localities must promptly transfer some cadres to concentrate on strengthening business work. All enterprise organizations must transfer vetted cadres to form strong, capable, flexible business offices, with dedicated personnel in charge, simplifying procedures, and completing tasks on schedule. Attention should be paid to boldly promoting cadres; those cadres with minor problems can also be given the opportunity to redeem themselves; for those cadres who have incorrect understandings of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign and want to leave their economic work positions, they must be educated and persuaded.

2.  A small number of district and village cadres lack sufficient understanding of the significance of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, and therefore passively wait, are not at ease in their work; cadres with problems sit and wait for a change of shift, and rural work has come to a standstill. Therefore, when mobilizing for production and drought prevention, all localities must repeatedly explain the policies, stabilize the cadres, and dispel their concerns. For cadres with problems, they should be enabled to lead drought prevention and spring plowing production work well and atone for their crimes. It is imperative to mobilize all district and village cadres in the shortest possible time to fully carry out production and drought prevention work.

3.  Epidemics are prevalent in North China, Inner Mongolia, and East China, which greatly hinders spring plowing work. All localities must immediately establish district and township health organizations, implement the principle of "prevention first," and establish and conscientiously implement an epidemic reporting system. In areas where epidemics have been discovered, vigorous efforts should be made to organize traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine to implement emergency treatment and necessary isolation. Efforts must also be made to treat livestock epidemics in a timely manner. In addition, in some severely affected areas last year, disaster relief work must be carried out in conjunction with the task of production and drought prevention.

    华北华东全面展开防旱运动
    各地必须认真贯彻生产防旱政策，加强春耕防旱的物资供应，克服区村干部消极等待和“换班”思想
    华北各省省级生产防旱办公室成立以后，华北全区的防旱工作已迅速地全面展开。河北省十个专区的专区级生产防旱办公室都已成立，并分别召开了会议，其中唐山、沧县、衡水三个专区召开了扩大会议。各专区并分别抽调干部数十人以至百人不等，组成检查组，深入各县推动工作。现在全省各县正召开区村干部参加的扩大会议，布置防旱和春耕工作。察哈尔省人民政府自二月二十一日至二十四日召集了各专区和县的负责干部举行防旱生产救灾会议，确定了防旱是目前的中心工作，确定三月份是防旱春耕救灾的突击月，要求各县在二月底开完会议，把防旱、春耕、救灾工作传达到村，并组织省、专区、县各级干部五千八百人的突击队，从三月一日开始，即普遍深入地轰轰烈烈地开展防旱、春耕和救灾工作。绥远省自二月二十五日起召集了专区、县、旗各级负责干部开会，布置农业生产、保畜、救灾及防疫工作。山西省党政领导机关已在二月十八日组织干部二十八人分赴各专区检查工作；并决定自二月底到三月六日为生产防旱宣传周。山西运城、长治、临汾、忻县、榆次各专区和高平、陵川等二十多县都已成立了生产防旱办公室，很多地区的群众已行动起来。平原省截至二月二十四日止，除湖西专区外，其他专区、县都已成立生产防旱办公室；省检查组已在二月二十六日出发赴各专区检查工作。全省提出保证做好春播、麦收和夏播三项工作，并订出计划发展水利六百多万亩，保证在任何严重的干旱情况下，连旧有水地仍能有一千万亩地得到正常的收成。
    华东区的春耕生产办公室已在二月二十二日成立，由华东军政委员会农林部副部长程照轩任主任，现已派出检查组分赴山东、皖南、皖北、苏北、浙江、福建工作。各省区办公室都已在二月下旬成立，并分别派出检查小组。皖北、苏北、浙江各省区的专署级办公室已成立，正督促各县于二月底三月初成立机构，深入各地工作。山东省人民政府在二月二十六日召开了扩大动员会，要求县以下自三月一日起全面转入生产防旱运动。
    目前各地必须认真贯彻中共中央“关于保证执行中央人民政府政务院防旱抗旱决定的指示”，和中央人民政府政务院“关于大力开展群众性的防旱、抗旱运动的决定”，注意解决下面三个问题：
    一、各地经济部门，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，许多业务停滞了。在防旱抗旱运动开展后，还没有完全行动起来，影响春耕所需的物资供应和土产收购工作。各地领导机关必须及时抽调部分干部专心加强业务工作。各企业机构必须抽调经过审查的干部，组成坚强有力机动灵活的业务办公室，专人负责，简化手续，按期完成任务。要注意放手提拔干部；对于那些问题不大的干部，也可给以戴罪立功的机会；对于那些对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动抱有不正确认识想脱离经济工作岗位的干部，必须加以教育说服。
    二、少数区村干部对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的意义认识不足，因之消极等待，不安心工作；有问题的干部则坐等换班，农村工作陷于停顿。因此，各地在动员生产防旱时，必须反复说明政策，安定干部，打消他们的顾虑。对于有问题的干部，应使他能好好领导防旱和春耕生产工作，立功赎罪。务必在最短期把区村干部全部动员起来，全力进行生产防旱工作。
    三、华北、内蒙、华东均有疫病流行，这对春耕工作很有妨碍。各地必须立即建立区乡卫生组织，贯彻“预防为主”的方针，建立并认真执行疫情报告制度。已发现疫病的地区，应大力组织中医、西医，实施急治和必要的隔离。对耕畜的疫病也须设法及时救治。此外，去年某些受灾严重的地区，必须结合生产防旱任务，认真做好救灾工作。
