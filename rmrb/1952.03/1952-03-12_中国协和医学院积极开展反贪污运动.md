    China Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) teachers, students and staff, enthusiastically plunged into the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, to cleanse the filth left by American imperialism. Many professors and doctors volunteered to join the inspection team; medical and nursing students successfully completed the task of inventorying all the college's materials and accounts. Many people sacrificed sleep, patiently checking every "muddled account." In the warehouse, they sorted out tens of thousands of test tubes from a chaotic pile of items. Field workers conducted investigations outside overnight.

    Judging from the many acts of corruption that have been exposed so far, the corruption phenomenon at PUMC is extremely serious. Almost every department, from top to bottom, is involved. Among the corrupt elements are not only staff but also professors. Some corrupt elements themselves are the owners of shops and factories or are directly colluding with unscrupulous merchants.

    Under the "jade-tiled palaces" of PUMC, a large amount of dirty and filthy things are hidden. Just as the people of PUMC said, "PUMC is a place where tigers are hidden in the mountains, and rats are everywhere." Chen Jianxing, the chief of general affairs, Lan Yutian, the director of the warehouse, Zhang Peiquan, the director of the cashier's office, Wang Xiangwen, the former director of the personnel office, and Liang Renhe, the director of the general affairs section, who were known as the "Four King Kongs" of the old PUMC, have all been reported by the masses. The big tigers Chen Jianxing, Liang Renhe, and Zhang Peiquan have all been suspended from their duties for reflection. In PUMC, corrupt elements can calmly steal whole boxes of medicines from the pharmacy; they can steal hundreds of bolts of cloth from the cloth warehouse. They "eat from the mountain if they live near the mountain, and eat from the water if they live near the water": those in charge of the warehouse steal warehouse materials, those in charge of equipment steal equipment, those in charge of medicine steal medicine, and those who manage patients steal patients' belongings...

    Feng Yingkun, an associate professor of neurosurgery at the hospital, is a major embezzler, embezzling enemy property (the property of war criminal Guan Linzheng) amounting to 2 billion yuan. After the start of the anti-corruption campaign, knowing that his illegal behavior could not be concealed, he voluntarily confessed his problems. Zhang Chengping, the chief engineer of the machinery department and a major embezzler, had been working at PUMC for 20 years. Since liberation, he had stolen more than 200 million yuan worth of materials from the hospital. When he first entered PUMC, he was a poor man, but now he is the owner of a mechanical factory of considerable scale. From the flush toilet in his home to the various machines used in the factory, nothing is not from PUMC. He also single-handedly cultivated a "big tiger" named Shen Yongchang, who specialized in repairing PUMC's electrical refrigerators. The two colluded under the guise of a "master-apprentice relationship." This tiger stole more than 110 million yuan with his claws. Zhu Qingshou, from the general affairs section, began working at PUMC as an accountant and purchasing agent for the general affairs section 30 years ago and has consistently engaged in corrupt behavior. After PUMC was taken over by the People's Government, he did not repent and continued to abuse his power. He extorted kickbacks, accepted bribes, and colluded with unscrupulous merchants to embezzle funds. In 1951 alone, Zhu Qingshou stole 400 million yuan of people's property from the 3 billion yuan of transactions he made with private merchants. This is only a preliminary estimate. After the anti-corruption campaign began, he and all the relevant shops formed a "defense alliance" and then shamelessly declared to everyone: "If I am corrupt, you can cut off my head." Lin Futao, the former deputy director of the warehouse, was originally a broker. After PUMC was restored, he was introduced to work in the warehouse by Lan Yutian, the director of the warehouse. With Lan's support, he was promoted to deputy director, in charge of all medicines and valuable glass equipment. Lin Futao then gained more opportunities for theft. He used every means to steal large quantities of valuable medicines, biological dyes, glass instruments, surgical instruments, etc. When the anti-corruption campaign began, he said he had only embezzled 2,800 yuan. When the masses besieged him, he even tried to cover up his crimes with the cloak of religion, saying, "Since I believed in the Lord, I have never stolen again." But after being exposed by the masses, he finally initially admitted to stealing goods worth more than 130 million yuan. Li Weigang, the head nurse of the emergency room, is a person with a habit of corruption. From gauze, bandages, syringes, and thermometers to the clothes on patients' corpses, there is nothing he does not steal. Yang Guizheng, the head nurse of the operating room, is also a well-known corrupt element at PUMC. Before the anti-corruption campaign, she had been reported. After the campaign began, she still waved the banner of "God" and insisted that others were slandering her. Later, she even feigned madness and went to the mental hospital to avoid the storm. No matter how cunning she was, she had to admit her crimes in the face of ironclad facts. In the operating room, she stole all kinds of items, such as delicate small needles for surgery, sutures, and rubber gloves. Except for taking out one or two good needles when the director doctor performed surgery, she only took out some rusty old needles when other doctors performed surgery, so that when sewing the patient's intestines, she even broke the patient's intestines, but she ignored the patient's life and death and embezzled more than a hundred delicate small needles. The sutures used by surgeons were bought from abroad with foreign exchange. Many doctors saved every inch and every point of suture, but Yang Guizheng stole more than 2,300 sutures. Doctors cherish the rubber gloves used for surgery and are reluctant to use new ones casually, but Yang Guizheng embezzled 152 pairs. In addition, many nurses stole patients' medicines. Nurse Han Yuzhi alone stole more than 300 bottles of penicillin and streptomycin from February 1951 to January this year by giving physiological saline injections and giving one person's medicine to two people.

    During the campaign, another dark side of PUMC was also revealed. Lan Yutian, the director of the warehouse, had been in charge of the warehouse for several years, but he did not know how many warehouses there were in the college. When people asked him, he said there were 22. But after this inspection, two more warehouses were found. In the warehouses, some had records but no goods, and some had no records at all, and things were piled up in a mess. Even if there were records, they were a mess. For example, some numbers had an extra "0" written, thus turning ten into a hundred and a hundred into a thousand. Many urgently needed valuable items were piled up with waste products. Many items had been damaged, more than a dozen wooden beds in the orthopedic department had become waste; many volatile items had evaporated, and the bottles and cans were empty; many explosives were placed in flammable materials. Many items, because they were not labeled with the brand name, did not know whether they were good or bad. In the pharmacy, more than 2,000 kinds of medicines (including more than 200 kinds of valuable medicines) were found to have expired and become waste due to negligent storage. According to preliminary statistics, the loss, waste, and backlog in the outer warehouse alone amounted to more than 7 billion yuan.

    In the library, PUMC's treasure trove of medicine, many precious medical works were found to be backlogged, and some precious scientific journals were also put aside. However, in the reading room, many yellow and reactionary books appeared, such as "Introduction to Love" and Malthus's "On Population."

    During this campaign, the inside story of the so-called "PUMC standard" and "international level" was also revealed. A professor at the hospital, in order to write a "PUMC standard" and "international level" paper, needed to take 30 samples of blood separately from 30 sheep, and then conduct experiments based on these 30 samples of blood. But his assistant took some blood from a mixture of many sheep blood and divided it into 30 parts. The professor used these 30 samples of blood to conduct experiments and wrote this so-called "international level" paper. A professor of neurosurgery reviewed the criminal behavior of using living people as "scientific research" objects in the past: once to observe the effect of anticonvulsant drugs on a Chinese worker; and another time to test the effect of large doses of radiation on the penetration of cerebral blood vessels on the head of a deteriorating mental patient.

    The struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has educated everyone at PUMC—professors, doctors, students, and staff—making them clearly aware of the ugliness of the old PUMC and determined to cleanse these filthy things completely, so that PUMC, which was poisoned by American imperialism in the past, can truly become the people's PUMC.

    中国协和医学院积极开展反贪污运动
    中国协和医学院全体师生员工，热烈地投入反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，以清洗美帝国主义所留下的污毒。许多教授、大夫自动报名参加了检查组；医护校同学胜利地完成了清点全院物资和账目的任务。许多人牺牲了睡眠，耐心地查完了每一笔“糊涂账”。在库房里，他们从混乱的物品堆里，把成万的试管整理了出来。外勤工作人员连夜在外边进行调查。
    从目前已被揭发的许多贪污事实来看，协和的贪污现象是极端严重的。从上到下，几乎每一部门都有。贪污分子中不仅有职员，而且还有教授。某些贪污分子本身便是商店、工厂的老板或直接和奸商勾结着。
    在协和的“碧瓦宫殿”下，掩盖着大量的肮脏污秽的东西，正像协和的人们所说，“协和是满山藏虎，遍地是鼠”的地方。号称旧协和四大金刚的总务长陈剑星，库房主任蓝玉田，出纳科主任张沛泉，前人事室主任王相文和庶务科主任梁人和，都
    一一被群众检举出来。大老虎陈剑星，梁人和，张沛泉都已被停职反省。在协和，贪污分子可以从容地把整箱的药品从药房里偷出；可以把整百疋的布从布库里偷走。他们“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”：管仓库的偷仓库的物资，管器材的偷器材，管药品的偷药品，管理病人的偷病人的东西……
    该院脑神经科副教授冯应琨，是一个大贪污犯，侵吞敌产（战犯关麟征房产）达二十亿元。在反贪污运动开始后，他知道自己的犯法行为是无法隐瞒下去的，便自动交代了自己的问题。机务处总工程师、大贪污犯张承平，在协和任职已二十年，仅在解放后即先后偷盗了院内两亿多元的物资。他刚进协和的时候是一个没有钱的人，现在已是一个有相当规模的机械工厂的老板了。从他家用的抽水马桶直到工厂用的各种机器，没有一件不是协和的。并且他还一手培养了一只专修协和电气冰箱的“大老虎”沈永昌，两人以“师徒关系”为名，狼狈为奸。这只老虎爪子就偷盗了一亿一千多万元。庶务科朱清寿，三十年以前就开始在协和担任司账员和庶务科采购员，一贯有贪污行为。协和被人民政府接管以后，他毫不悔改，继续利用职权为非作歹。他勒索回扣，收受贿赂，并和奸商勾结，合伙贪污。仅在一九五一年和私商成交的三十亿元中，朱清寿就从中盗骗人民财产四亿元，这还是初步统计。反贪污运动一开始，他和所有有关商店订立了“攻守同盟”之后，便卑鄙无耻地向大家具结：“若有贪污可以割脑袋”。前库房副主任林福滔，原是一个经纪商人，协和复员以后，他由库房主任蓝玉田介绍到库房工作。在蓝的扶植下他被提升为副主任，掌管全部药品和贵重的玻璃器材。林福滔于是获得了更多的盗窃机会。他利用一切方法偷盗了大批的贵重药品、生物染料、玻璃仪器、手术器械等。当反贪污运动开始的时候，他说他只贪污了二千八百元。群众围剿他的时候，他竟想用宗教的外衣来掩盖他的罪行，他说“自从我信了主就再也没有偷窃过。”但经过群众的揭发以后，他终于初步承认了偷盗价值一亿三千余万元物资的罪恶行为。急诊室护士长李维纲，是一个贪污成性的人，从纱布、绷带、注射器、体温计一直到病人尸体上的衣服，没有一件东西他是不偷的。手术室护士长杨规铮，也是协和人们所共知的一个贪污犯。在反贪污运动前，她就被人检举出来。在运动开始后，她还打着“上帝”的旗帜，硬说别人诬蔑她。以后她更装疯作傻，住到精神病房去避风。尽管她怎样狡猾，在铁的事实面前她不得不承认了自己的罪恶行为。在手术室她偷盗了各式各样的物品，例如外科手术用的精致的小针、肠线和橡皮手套等。她除在主任大夫施手术时拿出一两个好针外，在别的大夫施手术时只是拿出一些生了锈的旧针，以致在给病人缝肠子时，甚至把病人的肠子弄破，但她竟不顾病人的死活，贪污了一百多个精致的小针。外科大夫施手术用的肠线，是用外汇从外国买来的。许多大夫一寸、一分的把肠线节省下来，但杨规铮却偷盗了二千三百多支肠线。大夫们对于施行手术用的橡皮手套是很爱惜的，不肯随便使用新的，但杨规铮却贪污了一百五十二付。此外更有不少护士偷病人的药。仅护士韩玉智一人从一九五一年二月到今年一月，就用打生理食盐水针和把一个人的药给两个人用的方法，偷了三百多瓶青霉素和链霉素。
    在运动中，协和的另一黑暗面也被揭发了。库房主任蓝玉田，管了几年的库房，但是他不知道全院到底有多少库房。人们问他的时候，他说共有二十二个。但经过这次检查，竟多出了两个库房。在库房里，有的是有账无物，有的是根本无账，乱堆乱放着。即使有账目的，也是一篇糊涂账。如有的数字多写了一个“○”，因此把十弄成百，把百变成千。许多急需的贵重物品都是和废品堆在一起。有不少物品已经被损坏，骨科有十几张木床都已经成了废物；很多蒸发性的物品，都已挥发了，瓶罐是空空的；有许多爆炸品放在易燃品内。好多物品，因为没有标明牌号，不知道那是好的，那是坏的。在药房中检查出有两千多种药品（包括二百多种贵重药品）因为保管马虎，有的药已过期失效，成了废品。据初步统计，仅外库房一处损耗浪费和积压就达七十多亿元。
    协和的医学宝库图书馆，在这次检查中，发现许多珍贵的医学著作被积压起来，某些珍贵的科学杂志也被放置一边。但是在阅览室内，却出现许多黄色的、反动的书籍，如“恋爱入门”和马尔萨斯的“论人口问题”等。
    在这次运动中，所谓“协和标准”和“国际水平”的黑幕也被揭穿了。该院有一个教授，为了写一篇“协和标准”、“国际水平”的论文，需要从三十头羊里分别取出三十份血液，然后根据这三十份血液来作试验。但是他的助手却从混在一起的许多羊血里取了一些血液，把它分成三十份。这个教授就用这三十份血液作了试验，写成了这篇所谓“国际水平”的论文。脑神经科一位教授检讨了过去用活人作“科学研究”对象的罪恶行为：一次是在一个中国工人身上观察抽风药的作用；另一次是在一个衰退的精神病病人的头部测验大量放射线对脑血管的渗透力的影响。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争，教育了协和的每一个人——教授、大夫、同学、员工，使他们清楚地认识了旧协和的丑恶，决心要把这些污浊的东西清洗净尽，使过去受了美帝国主义毒害的协和真正成为人民的协和。（柏生）
