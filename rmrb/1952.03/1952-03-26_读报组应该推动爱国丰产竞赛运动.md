    Reading Groups Should Promote the Patriotic Production Increase Campaign

    To the Editor: On March 11th, the People's Daily published the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government's "Opinions on Launching the 1952 Patriotic Production Increase Competition"; on March 13th, the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council issued instructions to extensively carry out this movement. I believe that local newspaper editorial departments and relevant departments should organize rural reading groups to study and discuss these two documents in order to widely publicize them to the masses through them. In order to strengthen the leading role of rural reading groups in the "Patriotic Production Increase Competition" movement, I propose the following three suggestions:

    First, local newspaper editorial departments (especially farmers' newspapers) should vigorously promote the patriotic production increase deeds of national model laborers (such as Li Shunda, Han En, etc.) and model laborers in their own provinces and localities, as proposed by the Central Ministry of Agriculture. They should explain the scientific principles behind these model laborers' harvests in a simple way and provide reading groups with rich propaganda materials.

    Second, rural reading groups should vigorously promote the patriotic production increase competition movement, organize farmers to study the advanced experiences of high-yield models, and mobilize farmers to formulate specific plans for patriotic production increase; reading groups should be the basic force of the competition movement.

    Third, newspapers are powerful weapons for conducting patriotic education and disseminating production increase experience to the peasant masses. In the upcoming spring plowing and busy farming season, all localities should prevent the phenomenon of abandoning newspaper reading and learning.

### 读报组应该推动爱国丰产竞赛运动

    读报组应该推动爱国丰产竞赛运动
    编辑同志：三月十一日，人民日报发表了中央人民政府农业部关于开展一九五二年爱国增产竞赛的意见；三月十三日，政务院华北行政委员会又发出了广泛开展这一运动的指示。我认为，各地报纸编辑部和有关部门，应该组织农村读报组学习和讨论这两个文件，以便通过他们向群众作广泛宣传。为加强农村读报组在“爱国增产竞赛”运动中的领导作用，我提出以下三点建议：
    第一，各地报纸编辑部（尤其是农民报纸）应当根据中央农业部所提出的全国劳动模范（如李顺达、韩恩等）及本省、本地劳动模范的爱国丰产事迹，进行大力宣传，通俗地讲解这些劳动模范获得丰收的科学道理，供给读报组以丰富的宣传材料。
    第二，农村读报组应该大力宣传爱国增产竞赛运动，组织农民研究丰产模范的先进经验，发动农民制订爱国增产的具体计划；读报组应为竞赛运动的基本队伍。
    第三，报纸是经常向农民群众进行爱国主义教育和传播增产经验的有力武器，在即将开始的春耕农忙季节中，各地应防止放弃读报学习的现象。
