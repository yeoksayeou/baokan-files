Chen Yongkang, a farmer from Chang'an Village, Changlou Township, Songjiang County, Southern Jiangsu District, created a new high-yield record of 1,433 jin per mu for single-season late rice in 1951.

Chen Yongkang, of middle peasant status, has a family of eight and 16.1 mu of land, mainly relying on his labor alone. Last year, the average yield of single-season late rice (including glutinous rice and fields with reduced production due to bamboo gardens) was about 1,000 jin per mu. Among them, 7.83 mu of land yielded a total of 8,985 jin, averaging 1,147.5 jin per mu. The best-yielding mu produced as much as 1,433 jin, which is currently the highest rice yield record found in the East China Administrative Region.

Chen Yongkang is 45 years old. He has been farming since childhood, is diligent, likes to study techniques, and has accumulated rich production experience, creating a complete set of cultivation methods. His main experiences in rice cultivation are as follows:

I. Deep plowing and application of pig manure and
    Chinese milk vetch to improve the soil

The general paddy fields in Songjiang County are only about three inches deep. Chen Yongkang used a two-plow method to plow his fields to a depth of five inches. Because he plows deeply every year, applies more pig manure, and uses Chinese milk vetch (purple clover) as basal fertilizer, the topsoil has gradually become a black, loose, clay loam rich in humus, with excellent physical properties. Therefore, the roots of rice and Chinese milk vetch can absorb more nutrients and develop fully, while also reducing weeds in the field.

Regarding fertilization, he often says, "Whether you are devoted to farming or not depends on whether you raise pigs or not." Raising pigs and accumulating manure is his main source of fertilizer. He feeds his pigs mainly with rice bran, and uses mostly plant ash and a small amount of straw for bedding. Therefore, his pig manure not only contains nitrogen, but also is rich in phosphorus and potassium. Coupled with his use of Chinese milk vetch as basal fertilizer and the combined application of soybean cake and ammonium sulfate, the nutrients in the fertilizer are very balanced.

He has mastered the law that rice "develops tillers during Great Heat, grows thick during Minor Heat, and grows ears during the Beginning of Autumn," and applies fertilizer reasonably in stages according to its growth needs. In the early stage of rice tillering, he uses fertilization to promote tillering. A few days before the end of rice tillering, he uses fertilization to promote the thickening of the rice plants. Fertilization before ear emergence and booting helps the rice grow ears. The amount of fertilizer applied in each period is flexibly used according to the growth needs of the rice, so that the rice can fully develop tillers, each tiller grows ears, the ears are large, the grains are heavy, and the straw is less. If the fertilizer is not enough, he focuses on applying fertilizer in the later stage to control rice tillering, so that the fertilizer is used as much as possible for rice to grow thick, grow ears, and so on. This is one of the most valuable parts of his rice cultivation experience.

In his seedling fields, Chinese milk vetch is used as basal fertilizer, and top dressing (human manure or ammonium sulfate) is applied 15 to 20 days after sowing. The amount of fertilizer applied depends on the fertility of the seedling field, with the aim of cultivating strong seedlings. Too much fertilizer cannot be applied to the seedling field. If the seedlings grow too vigorously, they are prone to seedling blight (rice blast) and are also prone to death after transplantation. Last year, he also used Chinese milk vetch as basal fertilizer in his paddy fields. He believes that it is best to apply top dressing once before Minor Heat, but not too much; too much will cause the rice to grow more leaves. If the fertilizer cannot keep up later, there will be more straw and less grain. Last year, because of insufficient financial resources, he did not apply fertilizer before Minor Heat, so the tillering was not very high. Two days before Great Heat, he applied 5 jin of ammonium sulfate for the first time; two days before the Beginning of Autumn, he applied 1,200 jin of pig manure for the second time; and three days after the Beginning of Autumn, he applied 5 jin of ammonium sulfate for the third time. The last fertilization he did last year was eight days after the Beginning of Autumn. The amount of fertilizer applied this time depends on the growth of the rice at that time. If the leaf color turns light, 5 to 6 jin of ammonium sulfate should be applied immediately. If the leaf color is slightly lighter, 2 to 3 jin of ammonium sulfate can be applied. If the leaf color is normal, no more top dressing is needed. This fertilization is closely related to the development of rice ears. If applied properly, more than 100 jin of rice can be harvested per mu. If applied improperly, the ears will be short, the grains will not be full, and the maturity period will be delayed, making it susceptible to stem borers and frost damage. Therefore, the last fertilization is best done 11 or 12 days before the booting stage.

He adopts two fertilization methods based on different situations of sufficient and insufficient fertilizer: First, when fertilizer is sufficient (which he calls the "rich method"), seedlings are transplanted two days after Grain Full, harrowing is done 20 days later, and the first top dressing is applied 7 or 8 days after芒种 (Grain in Ear). If Chinese milk vetch is used as basal fertilizer, 20 jin of soybean cake is applied. If no basal fertilizer is applied, 30 jin of soybean cake is applied. Then apply 50 jin of soybean cake before Minor Heat, and 1,500 jin of pig manure one or two days before Great Heat. When fertilizing at the Beginning of Autumn, it is necessary to look at the growth of the rice to decide whether to apply ammonium sulfate. If the leaf color of the rice is normal, it is not necessary to apply it. Second, when fertilizer is insufficient (which he calls the "poor method"), seedlings are transplanted three or five days after 芒种 (Grain in Ear) (it must be after 芒种, so as to shorten the rice growing period). Because there is no Chinese milk vetch as basal fertilizer, the initial growth of rice is not good. Pig manure must be applied at the Beginning of Autumn (during Great Heat) so that the rice ears can grow long and full. The method he used last year was between the two methods. His fertilization method has been proven effective by many years of practice, and many farmers in the vicinity have also learned from him. For example, last year, Xue Yongxiu, a farmer in Changan Village, fertilized according to Chen Yongkang's method, and the rice field, which could originally only harvest 500 jin, yielded 700 jin per mu.
II. Adopting the "Uniform Ear" selection method for seed,
    Continuous Seed Selection

The "Laolaiqing" late japonica rice seed he grows was selected from a single ear from someone else's field ten years ago and propagated. At the beginning, he selected a single ear from the field for propagation, popularized it in the paddy fields in the third year, and continued to select seeds every year thereafter, and then screened to reserve seeds. Therefore, the ear length, number of grains, and yield of his rice have been continuously improving (from an average of 120 grains per ear at the beginning to 180 grains gradually, and the most have more than 270 grains). Combined with other high-yield reasons, the yield increased from 600 to 700 jin per mu to an average of 1,147 jin. The variety he selected also has the advantages of uniform heading, fertilizer resistance, hard stems, strong resistance to rice blast, less white ears, and high rice yield. But it has mild rice false smut. He said: "Seeds are selected every year, and yields increase every year." The variety he has selected is already very good in terms of ear length, number of grains, yield, and rice quality. But he is not satisfied with the existing varieties and is still constantly selecting better varieties.

III. Small-clump square close planting and shallow planting

When transplanting seedlings, he adopts a small-clump square close planting method, planting one to three seedlings per hole according to the different conditions of the seedlings, such as fat, strong, and weak. He believes that transplanting should be shallow (about eight tenths to one inch deep); transplanting too deep makes tillering difficult. The planting distance is close to a square, generally 6 inches between plants and 5.5 inches between rows. This allows ventilation between plants and rows, sufficient sunlight, and prevents the occurrence of diseases and insect pests. In this way, the area occupied by each rice plant is almost equal, which can be balanced development, so that the roots grow evenly around, absorb fertilizer evenly, the rice plants grow well, and the fertilizer effect can be fully exerted. Widening the plant spacing also makes weeding easier. After changing the plant and row spacing to a square, compared with the local rectangular planting method, 1,040 more holes are added per mu, which can directly increase the yield per unit area.

Small-clump close planting has fewer tillers per hole than large-clump sparse planting. There are only about nine tillers per hole in Chen Yongkang's field on average. In principle, it can still be increased. He did not have enough fertilizer last year, so he delayed the early stage fertilization, not allowing tillering to increase, but concentrating all the fertilizer on the development of rice ears and the filling of grains, so that each tiller bears ears, and the ears are large and the grains are full. The weight of the grains he grows is much heavier than others. Local farmers said: "Our thirty-two rice stalks, one person can carry. Chen Yongkang's eighteen rice bundles, one person cannot carry."

IV. Shallow water irrigation and "dry flowers and wet seeds"

He has noticed that if too much water is irrigated in the field (1.5 inches), rice blast rot easily occurs on the upper part of the rice roots (rice sclerotial disease), and the rice plants are also prone to lodging. However, in high fields, due to the shallow water, these phenomena are rare. Therefore, he gradually reduced the depth of irrigation year by year. The depth of water he irrigates is generally only maintained at five tenths of an inch, and at most does not exceed one inch. When transplanting seedlings, in order to make the rice seedlings enter the soil firmly and easily survive, he only irrigates a thin layer of water, and then gradually deepens it to five tenths of an inch. And every half month, he dries it for three or four days and then irrigates again until irrigation is stopped when the rice is yellow and mature and Chinese milk vetch is sown.

Throughout the entire rice growing period, the water must be deepened to eight tenths to one inch only during booting and grain filling. When the rice is in bloom, drain the water from the field, and irrigate again only when very fine cracks appear on the surface of the soil in the field. The irrigation method of "draining water during flowering and adding water during grain filling" is called "dry flowers and wet seeds" by local farmers.

Shallow water irrigation can increase water and soil temperature, and can also promote the activity of soil microorganisms, accelerate the decomposition of organic fertilizers, which is also beneficial to the development of rice roots, the increase of tillering, and the growth of rice. Appropriate drainage can inhibit the spread of rice blast, and can make the old roots deep and the new roots more, so as to stabilize the rice plants, and can also be fertilizer resistant and reduce rice blast rot, the stems will not become soft and black, and the rice roots will not rot.

Chen Yongkang's rich production experience is the result of his more than 30 years of hard work and painstaking research. He devoted all his energy to growing rice. For example, he paid attention to shallow water irrigation from the blackening of rice roots; he discovered the benefits of deep plowing from using a four-tooth rake to turn the ground when cattle were sick; from the process of rice development and growth, he discovered the rationality of staged fertilization, etc., which all prove that he is constantly using his brain to study technology. But he is not satisfied with his current farming methods, and he will continue to use his brain to study further. He believes that as long as there are the same production conditions as last year, he is prepared to strive to harvest more than 1,500 jin from his high-yield fields this year, and 1,300 jin from general fields. He believes that under the leadership of the People's Government, the rice yield per unit area can definitely continue to increase.

He always responds to the calls of the People's Government as soon as possible. Such as changing to four-foot seedling fields, collecting stem borer eggs, catching stem borer moths, selecting seeds, changing seeds, etc. Therefore, he deeply realized the benefits the People's Government gave him. When he was elected as the seed selection model in Chengdong District, Songjiang County, he said: "Chairman Mao liberated us and led us to great production, so we have comfortable days (that is, we have a good life). In the future, our days will be better. I must guarantee that I will grow the fields well, help everyone study production technology, increase yields, and increase the strength of national construction and resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea." Chen Yongkang also plans to participate in mutual aid groups this year. He understands that by organizing on the basis of voluntary mutual benefit, his personal labor shortage difficulties can be resolved.

    陈永康的水稻为什么一亩能收一千四百三十多斤
    苏南区松江县长溇乡长岸村农民陈永康在一九五一年种的单季晚稻，创造了每亩最高产量一千四百三十三斤的丰产新纪录。
    陈永康，中农成份，全家八口人，有田十六亩一分，主要依靠他一人劳动。去年单季晚稻（包括糯稻及受竹园影响而减产的田在内）每亩平均产量约一千斤；其中有七亩八分三厘田，共计收获八千九百八十五斤，每亩平均一千一百四十七斤半；其中一亩丰产田长得最好，产量高达一千四百三十三斤，是目前华东行政区已发现的水稻产量最高的纪录。
    陈永康现年四十五岁，自幼务农，为人勤劳，喜欢钻研技术，积累了丰富的生产经验，创造了一套完整的栽培方法。他种稻的主要经验如下：
    一、实行深耕，施用猪厩肥和
    红花草改良土壤
    松江县的一般稻田，耕深仅三寸左右。陈永康采用耕两次的方法，把他的田耕到五寸深。因为他每年深耕，并多施猪厩肥，又用红花草（紫云英）作基肥，使表土逐渐变成富于腐植质黑色松软的黏壤土，物理性质极好。因此，使水稻和红花草的根部可以吸收更多的养分，得到充分的发育，同时还减少了田间的杂草。
    在施肥方面，他常说：“种田存心不存心，看侬养猪不养猪。”养猪积肥是他主要的肥料来源。他养猪以喂米糠为主，垫圈多用草木灰和少量的藁草。因此，他的猪厩肥除含有氮素成分外，磷、钾两要素也很丰富，再加上他用红花草做基肥，和配合施用豆饼、硫酸錏，就使肥料中的养分配合得很平衡。
    他掌握了水稻“大暑发棵，小暑发粗，立秋长穗”的规律，按其生长需要，分期合理施肥。在水稻开始分蘖的时期，他用施肥来促进分蘖。水稻分蘖终期前几天，他用施肥来促使稻棵长粗。在长穗孕穗以前施肥，帮助稻子长穗。各个时期的施肥数量，都是按着水稻生长的需要，灵活运用，使水稻充分地发棵，棵棵长穗，穗大、粒重、藁少。如果肥料不够，他就着重后期施肥，以控制水稻分蘖，使肥料尽量用于水稻长粗、长穗等作用上。这是他种水稻经验中一个最宝贵的部分。
    他的秧田里以红花草做基肥，播种后十五天到二十天开始施用追肥（人粪尿或硫酸錏）。施肥量依秧田的肥瘦而定，以培育健壮的秧苗为目的。秧田施肥不能太多，秧苗如果生长过旺，容易生秧瘟（稻热病），移植后也容易死亡。去年他的本田里也是以红花草作基肥。他认为小暑前施用一次追肥最好，但不能太多；多了就会使稻子多长叶子。如果以后肥力接不上，就会藁多谷少。他去年因财力不足，小暑前没施肥，所以发棵不算多。在大暑前两天，他第一次施硫酸錏五斤；立秋前二天，第二次施猪厩肥一千二百斤；立秋后三天，第三次施硫酸錏五斤。他去年最后一次施肥是在立秋后八天。这次施肥多少，要看当时稻子生长情况来决定。如见叶色转淡，宜即施硫酸錏五至六斤；如叶稍转淡色，可施硫酸錏二至三斤；叶子颜色正常，可不再施追肥。这次施肥对稻穗的发育关系很密切，施用得当，每亩就可多收一百多斤稻谷；施用不当则穗短，粒子也不饱满，并会延迟成熟期，且易遭螟害、霜害。因此，最后一次施肥最好在孕穗期前的十一、二天。
    他根据肥料充裕和肥料不足的不同情况，采用两种施肥方法：第一种，肥料充裕时（他称之为富办法），过小满后两天就插秧，隔二十天就头耥，芒种后七、八天第一次施追肥。以红花草做基肥的，施豆饼二十斤；没有施基肥的，施豆饼三十斤。到小暑前再施豆饼五十斤，大暑前一两天再施猪厩肥一千五百斤。到立秋施肥时，要看水稻生长情况，决定是否施硫酸錏。如果稻的叶色正常，就可以不施。第二种，肥料不足时（他称之为穷办法），过芒种三、五天（一定要过芒种，这样可缩短水稻生长期）插秧。因为没有红花草做基肥，水稻初期生长不好，到立秋（大暑里）必须施猪厩肥，这样才可使稻穗长而饱满。他去年采用的办法是介于两种办法之间的。他的施肥方法，已有多年的事实证明有效，附近农民也多向他学习。如去年长岸村农民薛永修按陈永康的办法施肥，原来只可收五百斤的稻田，结果每亩收了七百斤。二、采用“一穗齐”选种法，
    连年选种
    他种的“老来青”晚粳稻种，是在十年前从旁人的田里选单穗繁殖出来的。开始他由田间选择一个单穗进行繁殖，第三年普及本田，以后每年继续选种，再经筛选留种。因此，他的水稻的穗长、粒数、产量都在不断地提高（由开始每穗平均一百二十粒，逐渐提高到一百八十粒，最多的有二百七十多粒）。结合其他丰产原因，产量就由每亩六、七百斤提高到平均一千一百四十七斤。他选的品种还具有抽穗齐、耐肥、茎秆硬、抗稻热病力较强、白穗少、出米率高等优点；但有轻微的稻麴病。他说：“稻种年年选，产量年年高。”他目前选出的品种从穗长、粒数、产量、米质等方面来说，已经很好；但他并不满足现有的品种，还在继续不断地选择更好的品种。
    三、小株方形密植和浅栽
    他插秧时采用小株方形密植办法，每穴按秧苗的肥壮、瘦弱等不同情况，栽植一根到三根。他认为插秧要浅（深度约八分到一寸）；插得太深，发棵困难。栽植距离接近正方形，一般株距六寸，行距五寸半。这样可使株行间通风，阳光足，防止病虫害发生。这样，每棵稻株所占面积几乎相等，可以平衡发展，使根向四周平均生长，吸肥均匀，稻棵生长好，肥效也可以充分发挥。株距放宽，除草也容易。株距行距改变成正方形后，和当地长方形栽植法相比，每亩加多了一千零四十穴，可以直接提高单位面积产量。
    小株密植，比大株稀植每穴分蘖数为少。陈永康田里每穴的分蘖数平均只有九根左右。按理还可以增加。他去年肥料不足，前期施肥就延迟一步，不使分蘖增加，而使所有肥量都集中到稻穗的发育和籽粒的充实上，做到每个分蘖都结穗，并且穗子大，籽粒饱满。他种的稻子的籽实重量，比别人的重的多。当地农民说：“我伲的三十二个稻，一个人挑得起；陈永康十八个稻把子，一个人挑不起。”四、浅水灌溉和“干花湿子”
    他曾留心到田间如果灌水过多（一寸五分），稻根上部就容易发生稻脚瘟腐烂（稻菌核病），稻株也容易倒伏。而在高田，由于水浅，这些现象就很少。因此，他就逐年减低灌水的深度。他灌水的深度一般只保持五分，最多不超过一寸。他在栽秧时为使稻苗入土牢固易活，只灌薄薄的一层水，以后逐渐加深到五分；并每隔半月干上三、四天再灌水，直到水稻黄熟期播种红花草时才停止灌溉。
    在整个水稻生长期间，只有在孕穗及灌浆时必须把水加深到八分至一寸。水稻开花时把田间的水排尽，等到田里表土晒有极细的裂缝时才再灌水。“开花放水，灌浆加水”的灌溉方法，当地农民称为“干花湿子”。
    浅水灌溉可以增高水温和地温，也可以促进土壤微生物的活动，加速有机肥料的分解，对于稻根的发育、分蘖的增加和水稻的生长也都有利。适当地排水，可以抑制稻热病的蔓延，并可使老根深扎，新根加多，以稳固稻的植株，还可耐肥和减轻稻脚瘟，茎秆不致发软发黑，稻根也不会腐烂。
    ×    ×    ×
    陈永康的丰富生产经验，是他三十多年来辛勤劳动精心钻研的成果。他把全副的精力都用在种稻上。例如，他从稻脚发黑而注意到浅水灌溉；从牛生病时用四齿耙翻地而发现深耕的好处；从稻子发育生长过程中，发现分期施肥的合理等，都证明他是经常开动脑筋钻研技术的。但他并不满足他现在这些耕作方法，他还要继续开动脑筋钻研下去。他认为只要有像去年那样的生产条件，他今年的丰产田准备争取收到一千五百斤以上，一般的田达到一千三百斤。他相信水稻单位面积产量，在人民政府的领导下，是一定可以继续提高的。
    对人民政府的号召，他都是尽先响应。如改用四尺秧田、采螟卵、捕捉螟蛾、选种、换种等。因此，他深深体会到人民政府给他的好处。当他当选为松江县城东区选种模范时，他说：“毛主席解放了我伲，领导我们大生产，我伲才有惬意的日脚（即才有好日子过），今后我伲日脚还要好起来，我
    一定要保证把田种好，帮大家研究生产技术，提高产量，增加国家建设和抗美援朝的力量。”陈永康还计划在今年参加互助组。他懂得：在自愿互利的基础上组织起来，他个人劳力缺乏的困难就可以得到解决。
