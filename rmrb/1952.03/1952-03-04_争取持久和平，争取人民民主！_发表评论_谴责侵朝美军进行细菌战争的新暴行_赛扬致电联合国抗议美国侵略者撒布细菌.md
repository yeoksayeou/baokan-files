Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 3rd: The latest issue of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" published an article on its front page condemning the new atrocities of the American aggressors in conducting germ warfare in Korea. The article pointed out: "The American butchers' use of bacteriological weapons against the Korean people does not prove their strength, but rather their weakness. This heinous crime once again exposes the bestial face of American imperialism to the world, proving that these 'civilized' barbarians will stop at nothing to eliminate millions of people and bring destruction and death to entire nations in order to achieve their bloody conspiracies."

The article concluded: "The masses of all countries are angrily condemning the heinous germ warfare being waged by the American aggressors in Korea and demanding an immediate end to this crime and severe punishment for the war criminals."

Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: TASS, Vienna, March 2nd: The World Federation of Trade Unions has published a telegram from its Secretary-General, Louis Saillant, to the United Nations. The text of the telegram is as follows:

The World Federation of Trade Unions expresses its firm protest against the recent methods employed by the American troops fighting in Korea under the flag of the United Nations.

According to a telegram from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, American troops are spreading large quantities of plague and cholera bacteria on the Korean front and behind the lines. The news of these crimes sends chills down the spines of all honest men and women. Just imagining this situation makes us feel as if we have returned to a world hundreds of years ago, and we cannot help but feel the same way we did when we first heard about the Nazi concentration camps.

It is inconceivable that the United Nations would allow others to use the latest inventions of the medical and scientific communities to carry out criminal activities, to eliminate the entire civilian population of a country.

The World Federation of Trade Unions believes that this crime violates all treaties, past and present, and violates the basic principles of humanity, and that it is the responsibility of the United Nations to defend these principles; therefore, it hereby notifies the United Nations of this crime.

The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on all honest people to do everything in their power to stop this act of using the latest achievements of science for barbaric purposes, to stop this Korean war that uses and tests the most terrible weapons of destruction.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”发表评论
    谴责侵朝美军进行细菌战争的新暴行
    赛扬致电联合国抗议美国侵略者撒布细菌
    【新华社布拉格三日电】最近一期“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”的首版刊载一篇文章，谴责美国侵略者在朝鲜进行细菌战争的新暴行。该文指出：“美国屠夫们对朝鲜人民使用细菌武器，不仅没有证明其强大，反而证明其软弱，这种可恶的罪行又一次在全世界面前暴露了美帝国主义禽兽面貌，证明了‘文明的’野蛮人为了要实现他们血腥的阴谋，不惜消灭成百万的人民并使整个民族遭到毁灭和死亡。”
    该文最后说：“各国群众莫不愤怒地谴责美国侵略者正在朝鲜发动的可恶的细菌战争，并要求立即停止这种罪行，严惩战争罪犯。”
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社维也纳二日讯：世界工会联合会发表了该会总书记路易·赛扬致联合国的电报。电文如下：
    世界工会联合会对于以联合国名义在朝鲜作战的美国军队最近所采用的手段，表示坚决的抗议。
    据中华全国总工会来电说：美军在朝鲜前线和后方撒布大量鼠疫菌和霍乱菌。这些罪行的消息，使一切正直的男女都感到毛骨悚然。我们仅仅想像一下这种情形，就会觉得好像回到了几百年前的世界，就不禁又产生第一次听到关于纳粹集中营的消息时的那种感觉。
    联合国竟会听任别人利用医学界和科学界的最新发明来进行罪恶的活动，来消灭一个国家的全体平民，那简直是不可想像的。
    世界工会联合会认为这种罪行破坏了过去和现在的一切条约，违反了人道的基本原则，而保卫这些原则是联合国的责任；因此，特把这种罪行通知联合国。
    世界工会联合会号召一切正直的人民尽一切力量，制止这种利用科学的最新成果于野蛮目的的行为，制止这个使用和试验最恐怖的毁灭武器的朝鲜战争。
