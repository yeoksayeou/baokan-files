Joint Directive of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government on Tea Production and Procurement Work in 1952

In the past two years, under the correct leadership of governments at all levels and the active efforts of all staff and tea farmers, tea production in New China has achieved rapid recovery and development. In 1952, in order to meet the needs of tea exports, regulate the domestic market, and ensure the supply of tea to fraternal ethnic groups, national tea production should increase by 27 percent on the basis of 1951. Currently, the tea picking season is approaching. Tea production and procurement departments in various regions urgently need to cooperate closely and vigorously promote the work. For this purpose, the following instructions are made:

(1) The current focus of tea production work is to concentrate efforts on the general reclamation and management of existing tea gardens to increase the yield per unit area on the basis of the original production. Tea seeds stored in various regions last winter should be supplied to tea farmers in a prioritized and free-of-charge manner for timely sowing. In areas where spring tea production loans have been granted, it is necessary to supervise and check whether the loans are actually used for production. In areas where loans have not yet been granted, state-owned companies can promptly issue the funds in the form of advance payments for goods, and cooperate with production loans to do a good job in tea garden cultivation, fertilization, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. Also, tea farmers should be generally mobilized to seize the season to pick and process tea leaves. At the same time, the agricultural and trade departments of local people's governments should select the main tea-producing areas to carry out patriotic production increase campaigns, formulate various reward measures, cultivate and select labor models for increasing production, and stimulate tea farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production.

(2) This year's tea production requires increasing the yield per unit area, and also strives to improve quality. The quality of tea picking and preliminary processing methods is the main key to determining quality. People's governments at all levels must strengthen leadership in this regard, organize the vast number of tea farmers, develop labor mutual assistance and production cooperation in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, implement technical guidance, and promote advanced experience. This year's tea picking promotes one bud with two leaves and one bud with three leaves; in terms of preliminary processing, promote simple rolling machines, joint baking, and centralized preliminary processing; the made rough tea should be graded and stacked after removing stems and impurities, and sold collectively.

(3) According to the needs of the international and domestic markets, we must not only increase the production of black tea, but also develop the production of green tea. Black tea should be developed in areas with better quality production, such as Keemun black tea, Ninghong black tea, Yihong black tea, and Dianhong black tea of middle and upper grades. Production must be vigorously increased, and purchase prices should be appropriately increased to stimulate production. Areas that changed to producing black tea in 1951, such as Pingshui in Zhejiang, Huoshan in northern Anhui, and Sichuan, should consolidate last year's achievements and further take into account quality and advance steadily in the original areas promoting black tea production. Low-grade black tea, such as Wenzhou black tea and Hebei black tea, has limited foreign demand and must be partially converted to green tea and strive to improve the quality of black and green tea to meet export needs. The original areas producing pearl tea and gunpowder tea also need to increase production, and in individual domestic sales tea areas, transform a part of export green tea in order to balance production and sales.

(4) China Tea Company should cooperate with cooperatives, divide labor and cooperate, and make timely preparations for purchasing tea. Cooperatives and private enterprises engaged in tea business must first complete the state's procurement plan under the leadership of state-owned companies. China Tea Company should set up purchasing stations widely in tea-producing areas to facilitate tea farmers to sell, and cooperate with other state-owned trading companies, especially grain companies, to ensure the supply of necessary production materials and living materials to tea farmers, and promptly withdraw currency to stabilize prices and stabilize the market.

(5) Cooperatives are the bridge between state-owned companies and the vast number of tea farmers. In tea-producing areas where cooperatives have been established, China Tea Company should entrust them to handle procurement business as much as possible, and provide practical guidance and assistance in specific work such as business technology to support the development of cooperative undertakings. Organizing tea farmers to collectively process tea is an important direction for the development of the tea area economy in our country. In areas that are transforming and promoting export tea, local grassroots governments should guide tea farmers to organize tea production groups or joint preliminary processing plants, and promote collective sales to save labor and lay the foundation for production cooperatives and collective management.

(6) The purchase price is calculated based on ensuring that tea farmers receive actual production costs and reasonable profits, and is calculated in RMB. There are high and low differences in the quality of various types of tea, and appropriate quality price differences should be maintained. The quality of the same grade of black and green tea that can be used for both domestic and foreign sales should be taken care of each other in terms of price, so that tea farmers can obtain the same benefits. In areas where black tea is transformed into green tea, pressed tea is transformed into black tea, and low-grade domestic sales green tea is transformed into export green tea, the purchase price should be appropriately increased. The price difference between spring and summer tea is given according to different grades of quality, appearance, etc., to prevent the phenomenon of tea prices being low first and then high. Once the tea price in various places is set, it should not be changed lightly, so as not to affect other areas; if adjustments are necessary, it should be approved by the trade department of the major administrative region; if the adjustment range exceeds 5%, it should be reported for decision. This year, we will continue to reward tea farmers for selling pure tea, and strictly implement the policy of high prices for good tea and low prices for inferior tea.

In order to successfully complete the tea production and procurement work in 1952, local industry and commerce, agriculture and forestry departments, and state-owned companies should strengthen ties and specifically arrange work under the leadership of the local Chinese Communist Party Committee and the People's Government Financial and Economic Committee, and immediately start actions to complete this year's tea production increase plan and strive to overfulfill it.

    中央人民政府农业部、贸易部
    关于一九五二年茶叶生产、收购工作的联合指示
    新中国两年来的茶叶生产，在各级人民政府正确领导，全体工作人员和茶农的积极努力下，已获得迅速的恢复与发展。一九五二年为满足外销茶叶的需要，调剂国内市场并保证对兄弟民族的茶叶供应，全国茶叶的生产应在一九五一年的基础上增产百分之二十七。目前，茶叶的采摘季节即到，各地茶叶生产及收购部门，亟须密切配合，大力推动工作。为此，特作如下指示：
    （一）茶叶生产工作，目前以集中力量，普遍的垦复及整理旧有茶园为主，在原有生产基础上增加单位面积产量。去冬在各地储备的茶籽，应重点地无代价地供应茶农及时播种。凡已办春茶采制贷款地区，应督促检查贷款是否确实用于生产？尚未举办贷款地区，可由国营公司以预付货款方式，迅即把货款发放下去，配合生产贷款，搞好茶园的中耕、施肥及防止病虫害等工作，并普遍发动茶农抓紧季节，采制茶叶。同时各地人民政府农业、贸易部门应选择主要产茶区，开展爱国主义增产运动，订定各种奖励办法，培养与选拔增产劳动模范，激发茶农增产情绪。
    （二）本年茶叶生产要求提高单位面积产量，同时还须努力提高质量。茶叶采摘及初制方法的优劣，是决定品质的主要关键，各级人民政府必须在这方面加强领导，把广大茶农组织起来，按照自愿与互利的原则，发展劳动互助与生产合作，实施技术指导，推广先进经验。今年茶叶采摘，推行一芽二叶和一芽三叶；初制方面推广简易揉捻机，联合烘焙，办理集中初制；制成毛茶应剔净梗朴分级归堆，集体送售。
    （三）根据国际市场与国内市场的需要，我们既须增产红茶，亦要发展绿茶生产，红茶应向品质较优产区发展，如祁红、宁红、宜红、滇红等中上级红茶，必须大力增产，适当提高收价，刺激生产。一九五一年浙江平水、皖北霍山及四川等改制红茶地区，应巩固去年成绩，在原有推广红茶生产区域，进一步兼顾质量，稳步前进。低级红茶，如温红、河红等，国外需要有限，必须部分转产绿茶并努力提高红、绿茶品质，以适应外销。原有珠茶、眉茶产区，亦需增加生产，并在个别内销茶区，改制一部分外销绿茶，以期平衡产销。
    （四）中国茶业公司应配合合作社，分工合作，及时做好收购茶叶的准备工作。经营茶叶的合作社及私营企业，必须在国营公司领导下，首先完成国家的收购计划。中国茶业公司应在产茶区广设收购站，便利茶农出售，并和其他国营贸易公司首先是粮食公司相配合，保证供应茶农必需的生产资料和生活资料，及时回笼货币，以平稳物价，安定市场。
    （五）合作社为国营公司与广大茶农群众间的桥梁，已建立合作社的产茶地区，中国茶业公司应尽量委托其代办收购业务，并在业务技术等具体工作上，切实辅导协助，以扶植合作事业的发展。合作社组织茶农集体初制，是我国发展茶区经济的一个重要方向，在改制和推广外销茶的区域，地方基层政府应辅导茶农组织茶叶生产小组或联合初制所，提倡集体出售，节省劳动力，打下生产合作社与集体经营的基础。
    （六）收购价格，以保证茶农得到实际生产成本和合理利润为计算依据，以人民币为计算标准。各类茶叶品质，有高低差别，应适当保持品质差价。同级的红、绿茶品质，可以兼作内外销的，其价格应互相照顾，使茶农获得同等利益。由红茶改制绿茶，紧茶改制红茶，低级内销绿茶改制外销绿茶的地区，酌予提高收购价格。春、夏茶差价，按品质、外形等不同等级给价，防止茶价先低后高等现象。各地茶价一经订定，不应轻率变动，以免影响其他地区；如必需调整，应经大行政区贸易部批准；调整幅度如超过百分之五，应上报决定。本年继续奖励茶农出售净茶，严格执行好茶高价，次茶低价的方针。
    为顺利完成一九五二年茶叶生产、收购工作，各地工商、农林部门及国营公司应在当地中国共产党委员会及人民政府财政经济委员会领导下，加强联系，具体布置工作，立即开始行动，为完成今年茶叶增产计划并争取超额完成而努力。
