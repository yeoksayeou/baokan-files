    Zhejiang Provincial People's Government General Office
    Self-Criticism Regarding Extravagant Wastefulness During Last Year's Tide Watching

    Editor: Comrade Ling Feng's criticism in the March 4th People's Daily regarding the "extravagant wastefulness of Zhejiang Provincial People's Government cadres during last year's tide watching" is correct. Last December 25th, we already submitted a written self-criticism to the leadership and made a serious self-criticism at the Provincial-level Organs Party Congress and the general meeting of directly affiliated organs held in early January this year. During the tide watching in the past (1950), provincial and municipal organs' personnel went to watch the tide in groups, spending a lot of material and financial resources. Last year, many cadres came to Zhejiang to watch the tide, and many cadres from provincial and municipal organs had the same request, so we uniformly arranged and planned the reception, security, and other matters for watching the tide. At that time, we only proposed to "see well, protect well, and entertain well," to make everyone "satisfied," without considering the huge waste of manpower and material resources, and the extremely bad influence it would have on the masses, thereby damaging the prestige of the Party and the government. This fully shows that our political and ideological level is not high, and we have been invaded by bourgeois ideology and work style. Regarding this matter, in addition to strict self-criticism and ensuring that similar errors will not occur in the future, we also thank the Party newspaper and Comrade Ling Feng for their criticism of us.

### 浙江省人民政府办公厅  对去年观潮铺张浪费的检讨

    浙江省人民政府办公厅
    对去年观潮铺张浪费的检讨
    编辑同志：凌风同志在三月四日人民日报上对“浙江省人民政府干部去年观潮时铺张浪费”的批评，是正确的。去年十二月二十五日，我们已向领导方面作了书面检讨，并在今年一月上旬召开的省级机关党代会议及直属机关全体人员大会上，作了严肃的自我批评。这次观潮时，我们只想到前年（一九五零年）省、市机关人员前后结队观潮，化费物力财力颇大。去年来浙江观潮的干部颇多，再加省、市机关不少干部也有同样要求，于是我们就统一地布置、计划了观潮的招待、警卫等事宜。当时我们只提出要“看得好、保卫好和招待好”，使大家“满意”，没有考虑到人力、物力的巨大浪费，和在群众中会引起的极坏的影响，以致损害了党和政府的威信。这充分说明我们的政治思想水平不高，受了资产阶级思想作风的侵袭。对这件事，我们除严格检讨，保证今后不再发生类似错误外，并感谢党报和凌风同志对我们的批评。
    浙江省人民政府办公厅兼主任  王文长
                        副主任  马青
