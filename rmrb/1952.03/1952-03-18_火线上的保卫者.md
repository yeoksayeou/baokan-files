    Defenders on the Fire Line
    Xinhua News Agency Reporters Wang Yuzhang, Liu Erning

    Scattered thirty miles south of Kaesong are six or seven villages including Zhaomenli and Sandali. From these villages, crossing a low ridge to the south, is the Imjin River, and on the opposite bank are the positions of the Li puppet army, fostered by the American aggressor troops. Most of the houses in this area have been leveled by enemy artillery fire, but the Korean people here have not left their homes. They live calmly on the front line. Residents say, "With our defenders—the Volunteer Army—here, we are not afraid of anything!"

    Before last December, the Li puppet army was entrenched in these villages. They robbed the people here of their rice, seized their young men, and plunged the people here into deep suffering. Last December, the Volunteer Army drove the Li puppet army across the Imjin River to the south bank; since then, they have built positions on this ridge, protecting the Panmunjom conference area for the armistice negotiations and the people in this area.

    As soon as the Volunteer Army arrived, they helped the local people heal the wounds left by the Li puppet army. Li Yingkuan, chairman of the Zhaomenli People's Committee, had been stabbed twice in the arm by the Li puppet army, and four other villagers were wounded by the Li puppet army's artillery shells. The Volunteer Army medics took out first-aid kits and medicine to bandage and treat them. The soldiers also helped the people in this area harvest the rice left unharvested in the paddy fields and helped them thresh and store it properly.

    In January of this year, the enemy, taking advantage of a motorboat, attempted a sneak attack on the Zhaomenli ferry crossing. As soon as the enemy's motorboat approached the north bank, the brave Volunteer Army soldiers rushed down from the mountain, and a burst of machine gun fire and grenades sank the motorboat in the river, drowning more than forty enemies on board. After this victory spread, the Korean people in the villages in this area brought wine and dishes to the positions to comfort the Volunteer Army soldiers, and they took the soldiers' hands and said, "Guard the riverbank well, and don't let them come over to grab grain and seize men again!"

    The Li puppet army's sneak attack failed, so they frantically bombarded the north bank with artillery fire. The houses in the Zhaomenli area were set ablaze. The soldiers on the position quickly ran down the mountain in spite of the artillery fire and rushed into the village to rescue people. They went into the smoke and fire to rescue the villagers' quilts, grain, and furniture. Medics ran in the artillery fire to bandage the wounded. People and things were rescued, but most of the houses were destroyed or burned down. At night, women holding children, grandmothers leading grandchildren, stood homeless in the freezing cold snow. When the soldiers saw this, they disregarded their fatigue from the rescue during the day and worked all night to dig underground shelters for the Korean people to live in. Soldiers Zhang Anlin and Jiang Fangqing did not rest all night, and dug a sturdy underground shelter for a Korean family. Squad leader Wang Yintang came back from guard duty at night and, instead of sleeping, took up a shovel to help a Korean family dig an underground shelter, digging until dawn. Under the influence of the Volunteer Army, the local people also began to dig underground shelters themselves, and rows of underground shelters appeared everywhere on the hillside. The people on the front line call these new villages built jointly by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean people: "Wartime New Villages."

    The reporter visited the new home of a sixty-year-old man, Bai Yunwu. It was a large stone cave dug into the hillside. His family of eight lived here. The cave was covered with straw, and several quilts were stacked in one corner; in another corner, grain and furniture were piled up. Bai Yunwu said that these things were all rescued from the fire by the Volunteer Army soldiers. This residence was originally given to his family by the Volunteer Army soldiers. The soldiers, in order to place his cattle, also helped him dig another cave next door. Bai Yunwu said gratefully, "This mountain is all hard rock, and it would be difficult for our whole family to dig for a month. The Volunteer Army saved our family. With a friend like China, we will surely win in Korea."

    In order to repay the Volunteer Army's kindness, the local people fully supported their defenders. They automatically took out straw mats to make the Volunteer Army's shelters clean and warm. Seeing that the Volunteer Army had difficulty eating vegetables, they sprouted soybeans and made tofu to send to the Volunteer Army. On the day of the Korean People's Army Founding Day this year, the people in this area presented flowers, care packages, and embroidered handkerchiefs to the Volunteer Army's heroes. The people of "Wartime New Village" also sent a silk banner, which read: "The Chinese People's Volunteer Army are our beloved protectors."

    火线上的保卫者
    新华社记者　王玉章　刘尔宁
    在开城以南三十里的地方散布着照门里、三达里等六七个村庄，从这些村庄向南翻过一座不高的山岭，就是临津江，对岸就是美国侵略军豢养下的李伪军的阵地。这一带村庄的房屋大都被敌军的炮火轰平了；但这里的朝鲜人民却仍旧没有离开自己的家园。他们镇静地生活在火线上，居民们说：“有我们的保卫者——志愿军在这儿，我们什么也不怕！”
    在去年十二月以前，李伪军还盘踞在这一带村庄。他们抢走了这里人民的稻谷，抓去了这儿的青年人，把这里的人民抛在深重的苦难中。去年十二月间，志愿军把李伪军赶过临津江南岸去；以后，就在这座山岭上修筑起阵地，保卫着停战谈判的板门店会场区，也保卫着这一带的人民。
    志愿军一来到这里，就帮助当地人民医治李伪军给他们留下的创伤。照门里人民委员会委员长李英宽的胳膊被李伪军刺了两刀，另外还有四个村民被李伪军的炮弹炸伤了，志愿军的卫生员就拿出救急包和药品给他们包扎治疗。战士们又帮助这一带人民抢收荒芜在稻田中的稻子，并且给他们打好藏好。
    今年一月里，敌人乘着一只汽艇企图向照门里渡口偷袭。当敌人的汽艇刚靠北岸的时候，志愿军的勇士们就猛然从山上冲杀下去，一阵机关枪手榴弹把汽艇打沉在江里，艇上的四十多个敌人被淹死在江水里。这个胜利消息传开以后，这一带村庄里的朝鲜人民纷纷拿了酒菜，到阵地上慰问志愿军战士们，他们拉着战士们的手说：“好好守住江岸，再不让他们过来抢粮抓丁！”
    李伪军偷袭不逞，就用炮火疯狂地轰击北岸。照门里一带村庄的房屋被打烧起熊熊大火。在阵地上的战士们连忙冒着炮火跑下山去，并冲进村庄里去抢救。他们钻进烟火里，把村民们的被子、粮食、家具抢出来。卫生员在炮火里奔跑着给受伤的人包扎上药。人和东西都被抢救出来了，但是房子大部分被炸塌或烧掉了。到了晚上，妇女抱着孩子，祖母牵着孙儿，无家可归地站立在寒风凛冽的雪地里。战士们看了这种情形，大家都不顾自己在白天抢救的疲倦，连夜给朝鲜人民挖地洞住。战士张安林和姜放青两个人一夜没有休息，给一家朝鲜老乡挖成了一个坚固的地洞。班长王银堂夜里带哨回来不睡觉，也拿起铁锹去帮助一家老乡挖地洞，一直挖到天亮。在志愿军的影响下，当地人民也自己动手挖起地洞来，于是山坡上到处出现了一排排的地洞，这些中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民合作修建的新的村庄，火线上的人们把它称做：“战地新村”。
    记者访问了一位六十多岁的白云五老大爷的新住宅。这是一个从山坡下挖进山肚子里去的大石洞。他一家八口人住在这儿，洞里铺着稻草，几床被子叠放在一个角落里；在另一个角落上，堆放着粮食和日用家具。白云五说：这些东西都是志愿军战士们帮助他从火里抢出来的。这所住宅原是志愿军战士们让给他们一家住的。战士们为了安放他的耕牛，又在隔壁帮他挖了一个洞子。白云五感激地说：“这山全是硬石头，我们一家老小挖一个月也难挖成。志愿军救了我们一家人。朝鲜有了中国这样的朋友，我们一定能胜利。”
    为了报答志愿军的恩情，当地人民便全力支援他们的保卫者。他们自动拿出稻草席子把志愿军的掩蔽部铺得又干净又暖和。他们看到志愿军吃菜困难，就生豆芽、做豆腐来送给志愿军吃。在今年朝鲜人民军建军节的那一天，这一带村庄的人民又给志愿军的功臣献花、送慰问袋和送绣着字的手帕。“战地新村”的朝鲜人民另外还送了一面锦旗，这面旗上写着：“中国人民志愿军是我们亲爱的保卫者”。
