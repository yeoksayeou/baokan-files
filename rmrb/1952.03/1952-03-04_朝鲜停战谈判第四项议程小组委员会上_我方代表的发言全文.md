Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: The full text of the speech by our representative at the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on March 3rd:

(1) Regarding the issue of prisoner-of-war materials, if you had carefully reviewed the records, you would have discovered what you have been calling an "agreement" for the past few days. You have been groundlessly accusing our side of reneging on an "agreement," attempting to deny materials that your side should have handed over more than seventy days ago but has not. To clarify the issue, I must take some time to revisit the past records.

First, let's look at what you call the "agreement." According to you, we reached agreements on both December 29th and January 1st. What are the facts? On December 29th, in our subcommittee, General Lee, you said: "I want to assume that our understanding is correct, that when our side has collected the information you want, your side will also provide this information to our side. If you don't say no, I will assume that our understanding is correct, and I will assume that when your side receives from our side the information I mentioned this morning (referring to the three points of information: the identities of 1,456 people, identifying the ranks and units of prisoners in the provided list, and reports on the whereabouts of more than 44,000 people), your side will provide us with this supplementary information. If your side doesn't indicate otherwise, I will assume that this understanding is correct. If my understanding is incorrect, please say so now, otherwise it will be recorded as a definite agreement. When our side provides the information to your side, your side should provide the information to our side." Then, let's see what I said next. I said: "I have said many times that the three items of information we are requesting from your side are basic materials, materials that you should have given us long ago. We have already given you that type of material. You know very well that what you are giving us are materials that you should have given us long ago, so what price do you want?" I also said: "Regarding the 50,000 people you mentioned, I have fully explained that this is a non-existent hypothetical figure." Here I stated very clearly that the materials on the more than 44,000 people are basic materials, materials that your side should have provided on December 18th, and that the so-called "50,000 people" are non-existent, a figure fabricated by your side. Where is the so-called agreement here to exchange the materials of more than 44,000 people for the materials of the non-existent 50,000 people? Nothing more, this only shows that you are still attempting to deny the responsibility of providing materials on the more than 44,000 people.

Let's look again at what we both said on January 1st. At that meeting, I said: "Another disagreement is about the exchange of materials. What I am dissatisfied with regarding your side's materials is that your materials are incomplete, and you are delaying the provision of supplementary incomplete materials. What you seem to be dissatisfied with on our side is that although our side has provided the material on the prisoners we currently have, you still need our side to provide the material on all the prisoners who were ever received during the war. I have explained the issue of releasing a large number of prisoners of war at the front and prisoners of war who escaped for certain reasons. I said in my speech last year that, to the extent possible, this material would be organized and given to you at an appropriate time." My speech concluded with: "We should jointly take appropriate measures to resolve these differences." Your response after hearing my speech was: "I express my gratitude for your frank statement regarding the exchange of other materials." These are the statements we exchanged on January 1st regarding materials. It is clearly stated here that your side should provide the materials that should have been submitted on December 18th as soon as possible, and then exchange supplementary materials on an equal basis to the extent possible.

The above is what you have been repeatedly calling the "agreement" between us on December 29th and January 1st. Faced with such facts, what reason do you have to accuse our side of violating any agreement?

Now, let's look at the issue of materials to see who exactly has violated the agreement and their own promises. On December 31st, 1951, you said: "Regarding the material on 44,205 people, we can give it to you on January 2nd." But you didn't hand it over on January 2nd. On January 3rd, you said again: "Regarding the issue of 44,205 people, please rest assured and don't lose sleep over it. We will give it to you immediately as soon as it is ready." But on January 12th, you violated your promise and actually said: "These materials are not needed by you until we reach an agreement." On January 15th, you further exposed your side's delaying attempt, saying: "Regarding the calculation and explanation of the 44,205 people, you can get them at the same time as you exchange the material of 50,000 people with us." On January 18th, you even openly declared that the materials of 44,205 people are not included in the materials of all the prisoners of war you are currently holding. On January 28th, 41 days after our side provided you with all the materials, your side finally supplemented our side with the materials such as the names, ranks, and units of more than 130,000 prisoners of war, but still did not submit the basic materials of the more than 44,000 people, which I pointed out that day. After this, in order to concentrate our efforts on resolving the main principle issues, our side did not frequently urge your side to submit this material quickly, but hoped that your side could consciously submit it as soon as possible in accordance with the principle of reciprocity. But unfortunately, your side did not do so. The bloody massacre on Geoje Island on February 18th completely proved that your speech on January 18th was not only a violation of your repeated promises, but also a brazen fraud. These 44,000 people are all in your prisoner of war camps, and they are suffering inhuman abuse. This massacre makes it undeniable that your side has a responsibility to provide a clear account of these prisoners of war. General Lee, who is violating the agreement? Who is violating their own promises? And who is cunningly engaging in fraud? I ask you, what right do you have to not immediately submit these materials of named and numbered prisoners who are clearly being detained in your prisoner of war camps, and which you had already announced you had prepared as early as January 28th? I now formally demand that you, 75 days after our side submitted your basic materials, immediately fulfill your promise and hand over this material.

(2) The subcommittee has reopened five times. The reason why the staff meeting was transferred to the subcommittee was mainly to resolve the main differences that were blocking the prisoner issue and preventing a complete agreement from being reached. Our side, with great patience, hopes to find a basic solution to this problem based on fair and reasonable principles. But unfortunately, your side's performance over the past three days has proved that in addition to creating unnecessary complications and showing no sincerity, your side's consistent delaying tactics have developed to such an alarming extent: from the second day of the subcommittee's resumption, your side has avoided the topic and proposed to re-discuss the issue of priority repatriation of seriously ill and wounded prisoners of war, which both sides had already agreed on, and the issue of exchanging prisoner-of-war packages, which both sides had already discussed and our side had already expressed its attitude on, attempting to confuse the focus of the meeting in order to achieve the purpose of delaying negotiations. The material of our prisoners of war that you owe us and should have given us more than seventy days ago is now being used by you as a tool for extortion. The issue of both sides forming a joint Red Cross group to visit prisoner of war camps after the signing and entry into force of the armistice agreement, which has already been agreed upon, has also become a new issue. All this shows that your side is deliberately creating difficulties for the negotiations, making them even impossible. This attitude and action of purposefully and systematically refusing to discuss the main issues, in addition to revealing your side's bad intentions, cannot in any way exonerate your side from the responsibility of delaying the negotiations.

(3) I now want to raise another issue: You should have already known that at 6:00 a.m. on February 18th, on Geoje Island, in your 62nd prisoner of war camp, your armed forces surrounded more than 5,000 of our prisoners of war, and subjected them to so-called "individual interrogations," forcibly carrying out "screening." Because our prisoners of war refused this illegal interrogation and screening, your armed forces carried out a collective massacre against them. This inhuman and bloody event completely exposed all the lies your side made at the negotiating table about treating our prisoners of war well. This is a complete insult and destruction to the civilization of all mankind, and is intolerable to heaven and human reason. Regarding this bloody massacre, our staff members were ordered to lodge a serious protest with your side on February 23rd. Your side made an unimaginable and absurd response on February 27th. Regarding this response, our staff members were ordered to issue a statement on February 28th, but your side has not made any expression on this matter to date. Our side now formally demands that your side provide a responsible account of this massacre and every one of our prisoners of war who was tragically killed.

    朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程小组委员会上
    我方代表的发言全文
    【新华社三日讯】三月三日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程小组委员会上我方代表发言全文：（一）关于战俘材料问题，如果你是仔细地查看了记录，你便会发现几天来你所谓的“协议”是什么。你一直无根据地指责我方背弃了“协议”，企图抵赖你方七十余日以前就应该交出而没有交出的材料。为了将问题澄清，我不得不花些时间来提一提过去的记录。
    首先来看一看你所谓的“协议”吧。按照你的说法，我们在十二月二十九日及一月一日都曾经达成过协议，事实是怎样的呢？十二月二十九日在我们小组委员会上，李比将军，你说：“我要假定我们的了解是正确的，即当我方已将你方所要的资料收齐时，你方亦将以这项资料交给我方。如果你不说不字，我即将假定我方的了解是对的，我将假定当你方从我方收到如我今早所说的那项资料（指一千四百五十六人的身份，辨识已提名单中俘虏的阶级和部队，以及四万四千余人的下落的报告——三点资料）时，你方即将以这种补充资料交给我方。如果你方不作其他表示，我只有假定这样的了解是对的。如果我的了解不对，也请你现在说出来，否则就将作为肯定的协议记在记录里。当我方将资料交给你方时，你方即应将资料交给我方。”再看接下去我是怎样说的呢？我说：“我已经说了好几次，我方要求你方的三样材料是基本材料，那些是你方早应当给我们的材料，我们已经给了你们那类材料了。你们明知道你们给我们的是你方早应当给我方的材料，你还要什么代价呢？”我又说：“关于你所说的五万人，我已充分地说明了这是不存在的假设的数字。”在这里我说的很清楚，四万四千余人的材料是基本材料，是你方十二月十八日即应该给我们的材料，而所谓“五万人”是不存在的，是你方虚构的数字。这里，那里有你所谓的以四万四千余人的材料交换不存在的五万人的材料的协议呢？没有别的，这只表示你们仍然企图抵赖提供四万四千余人材料的责任。
    再让我们来看一月一日我们双方说过些什么话。在那次会议上我说：“另一件没有同意的事是在交换材料问题上有些分歧，关于交换材料我对你方不满的是你方材料不完全，并拖延提供补充那不完全的材料的时间。你不满于我方的似乎是，我方虽提供了我方现有的俘虏材料，却还需要我方提供战争中所曾收容过的全部俘虏的材料。我已经解释过在前线释放大批战俘以及因某些原因而逃亡的战俘的问题。我在去年的发言中已讲过，关于这问题在可能范围内这种材料是要整理的，并且会在适当的时候给你。”我的发言最后说：“我们应该共同采取适当措施来解决这些分歧。”你听了我的发言后的反应是说：“对你关于交换其他材料的直率的陈述，我表示感谢。”这些就是一月一日我们关于材料方面所交换的发言。这里明明是说你方应将十二月十八日应交而未交的材料早日交出，而后在可能范围之内在平等的基础上交换补充材料。
    以上就是你口口声声说的所谓我们之间十二月二十九日以及一月一日的“协议”。面对着这样事实，你有什么理由能指责我方违反了什么协议呢？
    现在让我们从材料问题上再看看到底是谁违反了协议与自己的诺言。一九五一年十二月三十一日你曾说：“关于四万四千二百零五人的材料，一月二日可以交给你们。”但是一月二日你们没有交。一月三日你又说：“关于四万四千二百零五人的问题，请你放心，不必为此而失眠。一准备好，便立即交给你们。”可是一月十二日你违反你的诺言，竟说：“在我们未达成协议前这些材料对你们是不需要的。”一月十五日你更进一步暴露了你方的拖延企图说：“关于四万四千二百零五人的计算与说明，在你们拿五万人的材料与我们交换的同时，你们便可以得到。”一月十八日你更公然宣称四万四千二百零五人的材料，不包括在你方现在收容的全部战俘材料之中。一月二十八日，即在我方提供你方全部材料后的第四十一天，你方才将关于十三万多战俘的姓名、级别、部别等材料补交我方，但仍未将四万四千余人的基本材料交来，这一点我当天就指出了。这以后，我方为了集中努力来解决主要的原则问题，并没有经常催促你方迅速提交此项材料，而希望你方能自觉地本着对等的原则尽快提交。但是非常遗憾，你方并没有那样做。二月十八日巨济岛的流血惨案完全证明了一月十八日你的发言不仅是违反你方多次的允诺，而且是无耻的欺诈。这四万四千人都在你方战俘营中，他们遭受着非人的虐待。这一屠杀事件更不容置辩地使你方有责任对这些战俘作清楚的交代。李比将军，是谁在违反协议？是谁在违反自己的诺言？又是谁在狡猾地进行欺诈？我问你，这些明明在你们战俘营被拘留着的有名有姓的，而且你们早已于一月二十八日就宣布已经准备好了的材料，你有什么权利不立即提交我们？我现在正式要求，要求你在我方已提交你方基本材料之后的七十五天后，立即执行你的诺言，将这项材料交出来。
    （二）小组会重开已经五次了，由于参谋人员的会议之所以转入小组会的目的，主要是在于解决拦阻着俘虏问题便不能达成完全协议的主要分歧。我方抱着极大的忍耐，希望根据公平合理的原则来觅致这一问题的基本解决。但是不幸得很，三天来你方的表现证明了除了节外生枝毫无诚意以外，你方一贯地拖延伎俩更发展到如此惊人的程度：从小组会复会的第二天以来，你方就避开主题提出重行讨论双方业已协议的重病、重伤战俘优先遣返的问题，以及双方业已讨论，我方业已表示了态度的交换战俘包裹问题，企图混乱会议的中心，以达到拖延谈判的目的。你方所欠的早应在七十多天以前交与我方的我方战俘人员的材料，现在又被你们利用为进行敲诈的工具。已经协议的停战协定签字并生效后，双方组成联合红十字会小组访问战俘营的问题也变成新的问题。这一切说明你方故意对谈判制造困难，使它甚至成为不可能。这一切有目的有计划地拒绝讨论主要问题的态度与行动，除了透露你方不良动机外，一点也不能解脱你方拖延谈判的责任。
    （三）我现在要提出另外一个问题：你应该早已知道二月十八日拂晓六时在巨济岛上你方第六十二号俘虏营中，你方武装部队将我方战俘人员五千余人包围起来，对他们进行所谓“个别讯问”强迫实行“甄别”。因为我方战俘人员拒绝这种非法的讯问与甄别，你方武装部队就对他们实行了集体屠杀，这一惨无人道的血腥事件，彻底揭穿了你方在谈判的会议桌上所作的优待我方战俘人员的一切谎言。这完全是对全世界人类文明的污辱与破坏，为天理人道所不容。关于此一血腥屠杀事件，我方参谋人员已奉命于二月二十三日向你方提出严重抗议。你方在二月二十七日作了一个不能设想的荒谬的回答。对于这个回答，我方参谋人员于二月二十八日奉命发表声明，但你方迄今对此并未有任何表示。我方现正式要求你方对于此次屠杀惨案及每个惨遭杀害的我方战俘人员必须作负责的交代。
