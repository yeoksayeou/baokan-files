    Leads All Village Women in Smashing and Carrying Ice to Do a Good Job in Drought Resistance to Commemorate Women's Day

    Zhao Zhengshu, a women's labor model from Yanjia Tai Village, Wanping County, Hebei Province, is leading all the village women in transporting ice to fight drought and welcome the "March 8th" festival.

    Zhao Zhengshu, a women's labor model and mutual aid team leader, and the village women's federation convened a village-wide women's meeting on February 25th. At the meeting, everyone enthusiastically discussed drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing and sowing work. Zhao Zhengshu reported her experience in drought resistance and sowing last year, dispelling the idea that many women relied on the heavens for their livelihood. Everyone was determined to do a good job in drought resistance and prevention in order to carry out spring plowing and sowing. Everyone made a detailed plan, deciding to utilize all the water sources in the village. Now, all the village women have been organized and have begun to smash and carry ice. Woman Shang Yuancen, although carrying a child, also participated in carrying ice. Women Han Jingzhen, Zhao Fuyin, Wang Tenglan, Lü Jinping and other groups are challenging each other in competitions. They all expressed in unison: In order to commemorate "March 8th" Women's Day, we will not stop working until the ice is completely melted. They commemorate their festival with such actions.
