    Inspection of Continued Asset Losses Caused by Affiliated Warehouses During the Anti-Corruption Campaign

    Editor: After reading the criticism by Comrade Zhu Hua published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on February 29th, regarding the Northeast Cooperative Warehouses continuing to cause huge losses to the people during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, we felt that this criticism was correct and powerfully promoted our work. According to the results of our investigation, except for minor discrepancies in individual areas compared to Comrade Zhu Hua's criticism, the rest is entirely true. The main reasons for the serious losses are, first, our severe bureaucracy, insufficient inspection of warehouse work, and failure to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Second, the warehouse负责人 (fùzé rén - person in charge) Lü Yi did not carefully study methods of cargo storage and organize sales, and did not protect or promptly dispose of goods transported from various places. Third, most of the warehouse staff were employees of private warehouses that were taken over; during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, we focused on "tiger"-hunting work in the cooperative warehouses and neglected business operations.

    In order to prevent further losses to the people's property, we have put forward several emergency measures and have already implemented them:

    1.  Closely integrate the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign with business operations, and assign responsible cadres to specifically handle all business-related issues of the warehouses. For certain departments that cannot continue to work (such as the purchasing department), supplement them with personnel so that they can work as usual.
    2.  Strengthen storage work and actively seek sales channels in every possible way. In addition to strengthening the work of the warehouse's first sales department, distribute goods to various medium and small cities for sale. Goods that are at risk of spoilage should be sold at reduced prices.
    3.  In the future, for goods coming from fraternal societies, in addition to completing procedures carefully (such as waybills, sales vouchers, etc.), the warehouse must be notified in advance to obtain consent or enter into a contract to strengthen planning.
    4.  Losses caused by the warehouse's irresponsibility will be compensated by the warehouse after inspection and decision by the Supervisory Committee of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives.

    As for the losses caused by bureaucracy, we have requested the All-China Federation of Cooperatives to impose penalties.

    Northeast District Cooperative Federation

    Editor's Note: This self-criticism by the Northeast District Cooperative Federation is good. This problem is not only present in the Northeast Cooperative Warehouses, but also in many cooperative warehouses in other regions. It is hoped that leading cadres of cooperative societies in various regions will also quickly inspect and handle this issue like the Northeast District Cooperative Federation.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    东北区合作社联合社
    对所属货栈在反贪污运动中  继续造成资财损失的检查
    编辑同志：读了二月二十九日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载的朱华同志对东北合作货栈在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，继续给人民造成巨大损失的批评后，我们感到这一批评是正确的，这个批评有力地推动了我们的工作。根据我们检查的结果，此事除个别地方与朱华同志的批评稍有出入外，其余完全属实。造成严重损失的主要原因，首先是我们有严重的官僚主义，对货栈工作检查不够，未能及时发现和解决问题。其次是货栈负责人吕毅没有很好地研究货物保管方法和组织推销，没有把各地运来的货物加以保护并及时处理。第三、货栈工作人员大部分是接收的私人货栈的工作人员；在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，我们注意了合作货栈的打“虎”工作，而忽视了业务工作。
    为了使人民财产不再继续遭受损失，我们提出了几项紧急处理办法，并已付诸实施：
    一、把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动和业务密切结合起来，抽调负责干部专门处理货栈业务上的一切问题。对于某些不能继续工作的部门（如代购部），抽调人员加以补充，使它能照常工作。二、加强保管工作，想尽一切办法积极寻找销路。除加强货栈第一推销部的工作外，并把货物分发到各中、小城市去销售。有腐烂危险的货物则减价出售。三、今后各兄弟社来货除须认真办理手续（如运单销货凭证等）外，并须事先通知货栈取得同意或订立合同，以加强计划性。四、由于货栈不负责任而造成的损失，经全国总社监事会检查决定，由货栈予以赔偿。
    至于因官僚主义而造成的损失，已请求全国总社予以处分。东北区合作社联合社
    编者按：东北区合作社联合社这个检讨是好的。这个问题不只是东北合作货栈存在，其他地区许多合作货栈也同样存在。希望各地合作社领导干部也像东北区合作社联合总社一样地迅速加以检查处理。
