Ta Yuan City some unscrupulous businessmen play new tricks
Suggest relevant leaders to quickly check

In the vigorous movement against bribery, tax evasion, and tax dodging, some illegal capitalists in Taiyuan City are still racking their brains, playing new tricks, and continuing to attack the working class in a rampant attempt to obstruct and sabotage the movement.

Zhao Shuanghai, the capitalist of Taiyuan City Yingsen Jun Wood Factory, prevented workers Wang Shusan, Ye Fengqi, and other comrades from returning to the factory, saying, "During the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement, if there's nothing to do in the factory, go find work elsewhere." But he let his apprentices do the work he secured. Wang Baoqi, the capitalist of Huayang Wood Factory, openly said, "We won't start work until the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement is over." Worker Guo Yingren and other comrades returned to the factory four times to request work, but were all blocked. Capitalist Wang Chengxin said, "Because of the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement, the factory has no work, so find work elsewhere." These two unscrupulous merchants, fearing that workers would expose their criminal facts, prevented workers from returning to the factory, and deliberately framed the workers, causing them to lose their jobs, and then shifted the responsibility to the government. This trick is another new trick used by illegal merchants to attack us. Li Baozhu, an unscrupulous merchant in the Tonghechang Rice Store outside Dananmen, held a grudge after being exposed by Gao Haifu for stealing grain processed for the grain company. But he pretended to smile at Comrade Gao Haifu and said, "Old Gao, I think your words carry weight. If you say there's no problem, then there's no problem. Anyway, we do business to make money." Attempting to prevent him from further exposing him. When workers Fu Xilin and other comrades asked for wages, the unscrupulous merchant Li Baozhu used both soft and hard tactics, saying:
"As long as you have a clear conscience and get through the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement, anything can be done." Attempting to use this as an exchange condition. After the bribery and threats were completely ineffective, the unscrupulous merchant Li Baozhu used the vile methods of dragging down and transferring property to attack. He could start work but refused to, and sarcastically said to the workers, "You do it." When the workers asked for wages, he said:
"I'll give it to you after the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement is over, I don't have any money now." On the other hand, the unscrupulous merchant tried every possible way to transfer property (the amount is unknown). Attempting to dispel the workers' fighting spirit or achieve his conspiracy to dismiss the workers, so that they could not participate in the movement. We suggest that relevant leaders quickly check and stop the new conspiracy of the unscrupulous merchants. If they do not bow their heads and admit their guilt, they should be severely punished.

Shop assistants expose the conspiracy of unscrupulous merchant Sun Shuqing to dismiss workers

Editor: Sun Shuqing, an unscrupulous merchant of Beijing Private Liyuan Electric Motor Industrial Cooperative, has always evaded taxes, cut corners, and oppressed workers. As soon as this movement started, the unscrupulous merchant hid. Sun Yinmo, the son of the unscrupulous merchant, afraid of being reported, said to the workers, "There is no work in the store now, there is very little working capital, you come to be the shopkeepers!" The workers replied, "If you want to close down, report it to the Labor Bureau." After this conspiracy failed, Sun Yinmo said again, "I have already found you a job, the salary is high, everything is better here." The workers firmly rejected his enticement. Seeing that the trick had failed, the unscrupulous merchant Sun Shuqing hurried back. In early February, the unscrupulous merchant proposed to dismiss the workers, he shamelessly said, "As long as you agree to the dismissal, how much dismissal fee do you want?" Then, regardless of whether the workers agreed or not, he took the money and distributed it to the workers. However, these despicable methods did not shake the workers' strong fighting spirit. Under the leadership of the trade union, the workers held a reasoning struggle meeting. At the meeting, the unscrupulous merchant refused to confess, and the workers exposed his conspiracy and reported his criminal behavior. Liu Hong

Gao Haifu, a worker who insists on face-to-face struggle with unscrupulous merchants

Gao Haifu is a worker in the private Tonghechang Factory in Taiyuan City, and is a model combatant in the anti-bribery movement.

More than two months ago, in order to stabilize prices, the Taiyuan Grain Company transferred a large amount of millet from other places and entrusted it to private enterprises for processing. However, due to the unfamiliarity of the cadres of the Grain Company with the business, they were deceived by some processing households, who collected about two kilograms less of pure rice per hundred kilograms, causing serious losses to state property. Gao Haifu thought: This is all the property of the people, how can we let illegal merchants swallow it? He thought: Capitalists are really bad. When we mobilize them to donate planes and cannons, they pretend to be poor all day long, but secretly they are stealing state property like this. He ignored the manager Li Baozhu's threats and boldly reported it to the government. After detailed investigation, the Grain Company proved that what Gao Haifu said was true, and found that not only Tonghechang, but also Shengji, Yonglisheng and other eight processing households had such theft. According to preliminary calculations, these unscrupulous merchants stole more than 51,000 kilograms of state millet.

When the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement started, Gao Haifu became even more active. He worked day and night, on the one hand mobilizing the capitalists to confess, and on the other hand organizing the vast number of workers and shop assistants to open fire on the unscrupulous merchants who refused to confess. The unscrupulous merchant Li Baozhu wanted to win over Gao Haifu, so he asked his wife to call Gao Haifu to his home and cried to him, saying, "Haifu! Your heart is not made of iron, please do me a favor! I will never treat you badly in the future." Gao Haifu stood firm and sternly exposed all the conspiracies of the unscrupulous merchant Li Baozhu, and hated the unscrupulous merchant Li Baozhu even more. He mobilized all the workers in the store to expose all the crimes of Li Baozhu and launched a ruthless face-to-face struggle against Li Baozhu. Under the pressure of all the workers, Li Baozhu admitted that he had stolen more than 27,000 kilograms of millet from the Grain Company, in addition to what he had admitted last time. They also revealed the hidden enemy and puppet property of Tonghechang. In addition to the previous disclosures, they also revealed that the unscrupulous merchants of the other eight processing factories had stolen more than 100,000 kilograms of millet from the Grain Company. Gao Haifu's active leadership in reporting has prevented a lot of losses to state property. But Gao Haifu is not proud at all. He said, "Our 'big tigers' have not been completely captured, the unscrupulous merchants have not bowed their heads, we must continue to fight. We will never stop fighting until all the tigers in the industrial and commercial circles are captured."

The old worker Wang Pingshan won the fight against the unscrupulous merchant

Wang Pingshan is an old worker, now working as a chief technician in the private Heyihe Construction Factory. Since coming to the factory in June last year, he has carried out a resolute struggle against the illegal behavior of the unscrupulous merchants Wang Guanhai and Wang Fahuai brothers.

After the start of the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement, Comrade Wang Pingshan actively led all the employees to expose the criminal facts of the unscrupulous merchants Wang brothers in bribing, evading national taxes, and cutting corners to obtain huge profits. At the first meeting, he exposed the two sets of accounts of the unscrupulous merchants. In this account alone, it was found that the unscrupulous merchants had evaded more than 400 million yuan in business tax, and the amount of fake receipts found was more than 113,600 kilograms of millet and more than 4 million yuan. He mobilized Yan Hulin (labor side), a relative of the unscrupulous merchant, to stand with the workers and expose the crimes of the unscrupulous merchants. This quickly broke the "alliance of offense and defense" formed by the unscrupulous merchants. Afterwards, he exposed the fact that the unscrupulous merchants had bribed 27 cadres. In a certain project alone, the unscrupulous merchants stole more than 100 million yuan of state property, causing more than 200 million yuan in losses to the project. After the unscrupulous merchant Wang Fahuai absconded in fear of crime, he mobilized Wang Fahuai's wife and Wang's relatives Zhang Daofa and nephew Wang Junluan to report the place where Wang Fahuai had fled. Finally, he drew a map and personally went to Huangtupo Village, Wutai Mountain, with the public security officer to arrest the unscrupulous merchant.

I think Wang Pingshan's spirit of fighting against unscrupulous merchants is worth learning.

Under the education of the trade union, shop assistant Wang Guangqian returned to the team

Editor: I am the accountant and business buyer of Yuda Commercial Bank. The capitalist is my uncle. I lent five taels of gold to the capitalist to expand the business. The unscrupulous merchants used despicable means such as stealing state intelligence, evading taxes, and passing off inferior goods as good goods to obtain huge profits. I regarded myself as a meritorious person in Yuda, thinking that my interests were inseparable from those of the capitalist. After the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement started, I did not study seriously, and my class consciousness was very vague. I never thought of reporting the unscrupulous merchants. I was afraid of losing my job and losing the five taels of gold that I had in my hands. The trade union educated me, and the inspection team members told me the government's policies, but I still couldn't understand it. I confessed some problems, which were either small or had already been confessed by the unscrupulous merchants. I tried to cover up the unscrupulous merchants everywhere, trying to get through this difficult situation. As the movement gradually deepened and the firepower became stronger and stronger, my thoughts began to struggle. I saw that the employees were all fighting fiercely with the unscrupulous merchants, but I stood by and watched, as if it had nothing to do with me. I felt very painful. The comrades of the trade union and the inspection team continued to enlighten me and asked me to return to the team, which further strengthened my determination to drop the burden. I hate my infatuation with covering up the unscrupulous merchants. I am really sorry to Chairman Mao! I finally made amends for my crimes and exposed all the crimes of the unscrupulous merchants, such as stealing state economic intelligence and forming an alliance of offense and defense with corrupt officials. Wang Guangqian

Only by Relying on the Working Class Can We Do a Good Job in Inspecting Corruption and Bribery

Editor: I am an inspector of a certain inspection team of the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Thrift Inspection Committee. On the evening of February 11, when we and the workers of the Xi'an Woodware Shop were collecting materials on the crimes of the unscrupulous merchants, He Gengchen, an old worker who had worked in the shop, made a special trip from Chunlong Bridge, a round trip of 60 miles, to participate. In order to accurately determine the numbers of the unscrupulous merchants cutting corners, all the workers held folding rulers on the substandard woodware and measured it, not letting go of an inch or a point. With the active assistance of the workers, we have preliminarily inspected that the unscrupulous merchants of the shop cut corners for 150 million yuan. In the past ten days or so, we have deeply understood the essence of the two different classes from the inspection work. One is the reactionary class essence of the old cunning and profiteering unscrupulous merchants who refuse to confess; the other is the essence of the working class who are loyal, cherish state property, and are responsible to the motherland and the people. This significant and powerful contrast constantly encourages us, educates us, and makes us realize that only by relying on the working class can we do a good job in inspection work. Si Shanqi

    进一步发动店员工人检举奸商不法行为
    太原市某些奸商耍新花样
    建议有关领导方面迅速检查
    在大张旗鼓地反行贿、反偷税漏税运动中，太原市仍有一些不法资本家，费尽心机，耍新花样，继续猖狂地向工人阶级进攻，企图阻碍、破坏运动。
    太原市英森竣木厂资方赵双海阻拦工人王书三、叶风其等同志回厂，并说：“反行贿、反偷税漏税运动中，厂内没干的，你们出去找活哇。”但将揽到的活儿让徒弟们做。华洋木厂资方王保起公开地说：“反行贿、反偷税漏税运动不完不开工。”工人郭应仁等同志曾回厂四次要求上工，都遭到阻拦。资方王成信说：“因为反行贿、反偷税漏税，厂里没活，你们别处找活哇。”这两个木厂的奸商，因害怕工人揭发其罪恶事实，阻拦工人回厂外，并有意陷害工人，使工人失业，再将责任转嫁于政府。这种诡计是不法奸商向我们进攻的又一新花样。大南门外同和昌米店奸商李宝珠被高海福揭发了盗窃粮食公司加工米的罪恶后，怀恨在心。但却在高海福同志面前假惺惺地笑着说：“老高，我看你说一句顶一句。你说没问题，咱就没问题啦。反正咱做买卖要赚钱才干。”企图阻拦他再揭发。工人傅锡林等同志要工资时，奸商李宝珠又软硬兼施地说：
    “只要你们掬良心，把反行贿、反偷税漏税运动对付过去，什么也好办。”企图以此为交换条件。收买、威胁完全无效以后，奸商李宝珠又用拖垮、转移财产的恶劣办法来进攻。他能开工却不开工，并讽刺工人说：“你们干哇。”工人要工钱、他说：
    “过了反行贿、反偷税漏税运动再给，现在没钱。”而另一方面奸商却生方想法地转移财产（数目不详）。企图打消工人斗志或达到其解雇工人，使之不能参加运动的阴谋。我们建议有关领导方面迅速检查、制止奸商新的阴谋，他们如不低头认罪，就应该受到严惩。

    店员揭破了奸商孙树清企图解雇工人的阴谋
    编辑同志：北京私营理原电机工业社奸商孙树清一贯偷税、漏税，偷工减料，欺压工人。这次运动刚开始，奸商就躲起来了。奸商的儿子孙印模怕被检举，对工人们说：“现在柜上没有活了，流动资金很少，你们来当掌柜的罢！”工人回答：“要歇业，到劳动局去呈报。”这个阴谋失败后，孙印模又说：“我已代你们找好工作，薪金高，什么都比这儿强。”工人们坚决拒绝了他的利诱。奸商孙树清眼看诡计失败，连忙回来。二月初，奸商又提出解雇工人，他无耻地说：“只要你们答应解雇，要多少解雇费给多少。”接着，也不管工人同意与否，拿钱发给工人。可是，这些卑鄙手段并没有动摇了工人的坚强斗志，在工会的领导下，工人召开了说理斗争大会。会上，奸商拒绝坦白，工人们揭穿奸谋，检举了他的犯罪行为。    刘虹
    向奸商坚持面对面斗争的工人高海福
    高海福是太原市私营同和昌工厂的工人，是一个反行贿运动中的模范战斗员。
    两个多月以前，太原市粮食公司为了稳定物价曾由外埠调来大批谷子，委托私营企业加工。但由于粮食公司干部不熟悉业务，为一部分加工户所蒙蔽，每百斤少收净米二斤左右，造成国家财产的严重损失。高海福想：这都是人民的财产，怎能让不法商人吞没呢？他想：资本家实在坏，动员他捐献飞机大炮，他成天装穷，可是他们暗地里就这样盗窃国家财产。他就不顾经理李宝珠对他的威胁，大胆地向政府检举了。粮食公司经过详细调查，证明高海福所谈情况属实，并查出不但同和昌如此，盛记、永利生等八家加工户都有这种盗窃行为。经初步计算，这些奸商，共盗窃国家小米五万一千多斤。
    反行贿、反偷税漏税运动开始，高海福更加积极了。他每天不分昼夜，一方面动员资方坦白，一方面组织广大工人店员向拒不坦白的奸商开火。奸商李宝珠想拉拢高海福，叫自己的老婆把高海福叫到家中，向他哭哭啼啼，说什么：“海福！你的心不是铁长的，你行行好吧！我以后决不会亏了你。”高海福立场坚定，严厉地揭穿了奸商李宝珠的一切阴谋，对奸商李宝珠更加痛恨了。他发动全柜工人揭发李宝珠的一切罪恶，向李宝珠展开了无情的面对面的斗争。在全体工人的压力下，李宝珠除上次承认的以外，又承认偷盗了粮食公司小米两万七千多斤。他们还揭发出同和昌隐藏的敌伪财产。对其他八家加工工厂，除上次揭发的以外，又揭发出奸商们偷盗了十余万斤粮食公司的小米。高海福这样积极地领导检举，使国家财产避免了很多损失。但是高海福一点也不骄傲。他说：“我们的‘大老虎’还没有捉净，奸商们还没有低头，我们必须继续战斗。不把工商界所有的老虎捉净决不收兵。”

    老工人王聘山对奸商的斗争胜利了
    王聘山是个老工人，现在私营合义和营造厂任主任技师。自从去年六月份来该厂后，就和奸商王官槐、王发槐兄弟的非法行为进行了坚决的斗争。
    反行贿、反偷税漏税运动开始后，王聘山同志积极带领全体职工，揭发了奸商王氏兄弟行贿、偷漏国税、偷工减料获取暴利的罪恶事实。在第一次会议上，他就揭发了奸商的两套账。只在这本账里，就发现奸商偷漏营业额四亿多元，查出开假单据的款额，有十一万三千六百多斤小米又四百多万元。他动员奸商的亲戚阎虎林（劳方），和工人站在一起，揭发奸商的罪恶。这样就很快地攻破了奸商们所订的“攻守同盟”。其后，他又揭发了奸商向二十七个干部行贿的事实，只在某一工程中，奸商就窃取了国家财产一亿多元，使工程受到了二亿多元的损失。奸商王发槐畏罪潜逃以后，他又动员王发槐的老婆和王的亲戚张道发、侄儿王俊鸾，检举了王发槐逃跑的地方。最后，他绘下地图，亲自和公安员去五台黄土坡村把奸商抓回来了。
    我认为王聘山向奸商战斗的精神，是值得我们学习的。

    在工会教育下，店员王广谦归了队
    编辑同志：我是裕大商行的会计员兼业务采买员，资方是我的姨丈。我曾把五两黄金借给资方，以扩充营业。奸商用盗窃国家情报、偷税漏税、次货冒充好货等卑鄙手段，获得了暴利。我以裕大功臣自居，认为自己的利益和资方是分不开的。反贪污、反行贿运动展开后，我不认真学习，阶级意识很模糊，从没有想到要检举奸商。我怕失业，怕以前自己手上不干净，五两黄金要丢掉。工会方面教育我，检查组人员对我讲政府的政策，但我仍搞不通。我交代了一些问题，其中不是小的，就是奸商已坦白过的。我处处掩护奸商，企图混过这一关。运动逐渐深入，火力越来越强，我的思想开始斗争起来了。我看见职工们都热烈地和奸商斗争，自己却袖手旁观，好似没有我一份，感到很痛苦。工会和检查组的同志依然不断启发我，要我归队，更坚定了我丢下包袱的决心。我痛恨我的执迷不悟，替奸商背黑锅，实在对不起毛主席！我终于戴罪立功，揭发了奸商偷盗国家经济情报、和贪污犯订立攻守同盟等一切罪行。    王广谦
    只有依靠工人阶级才能做好检查贪污行贿工作
    编辑同志：我是北京市人民政府节约检查委员会某检查组的检查人员。二月十一日晚，我们和西安木器行的工人收集奸商的罪行材料时，曾在该行作过工的老工人贺庚辰，往返六十里路，特地由春龙桥赶来参加。为了把奸商偷工减料的数字搞准确，所有工人在不合规格的木器上，拿着折尺衡量，一寸一分都不肯放过。经过工人们的积极协助，我们已初步检查出该行奸商偷工减料一亿五千万元。十多天来，我们从检查工作里深刻地认识了两个不同阶级的本质。一个是老奸巨滑、唯利是图、拒不坦白的奸商的反动的阶级本质；另一个是忠心耿耿、爱护国家财物、对祖国人民负责的工人阶级的本质。这一显著的有力的对比，时时鼓舞着我们，教育着我们，并使我们体会到只有依靠工人阶级，才能作好检查工作。    司善琦
