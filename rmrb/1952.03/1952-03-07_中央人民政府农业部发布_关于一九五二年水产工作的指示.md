The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued instructions on aquatic work for 1952 on March 5th. The instructions stated: China's aquatic industry made significant progress in 1951 compared to the previous year. According to last year's production plan, aquatic products completed 113.8 percent of the production task, and China's aquatic industry has recovered to 83 percent of its pre-war level.

The instructions pointed out: The guiding principle for national aquatic work in 1952 should be: vigorously develop freshwater aquaculture, steadily improve marine production; strengthen fishermen's organizations, improve technology, and increase unit yield, so that China's aquatic products can be restored to pre-war levels, and strive to exceed pre-war levels by 13.33 percent. In order to complete this year's aquatic tasks, all regions must do the following:

	1. Organize, improve technology, and increase production: All major administrative regions and provincial people's governments must mobilize and organize fishermen to prepare before the spring fishing season, strengthen production leadership in fishing ports and villages, mobilize fishermen to organize mutual aid and cooperation, launch production competition campaigns, cultivate a new batch of fishing labor models and typical production mutual aid groups on the existing basis, establish new production banners, and promote production experience and improve production technology in order to generally increase unit yield. In fishing areas with feudal exploitation forces, appropriate measures should be taken to mobilize fishermen to carry out democratic reforms and liberate productive forces. In areas where there is enemy and bandit harassment at sea, fishermen should be organized for self-defense, adopting a combination of labor and military, closely linking with coastal defense, and strengthening coastal protection work.

	2. Restore the fishery production of existing freshwater lakes, swamps, ponds, and reservoirs, vigorously develop and expand aquaculture areas, and promote the use of farmland irrigation ditches and rice fields for fish farming as a rural sideline. The people's governments of all major administrative regions should formulate fishery management methods, conscientiously protect aquatic reproduction, determine the utilization and ownership of freshwater surfaces, and adopt various business methods such as public, private, joint public-private, and collective production to carry out aquaculture production. The People's Government should implement planned unified management of fish fry production and supply. Provinces with vast water surfaces should establish demonstration fish farms and fish seed farms to conduct trial breeding of superior varieties and prevent and control diseases, and guide the masses in fish farming.

	3. In terms of aquatic product processing, transportation, and sales, all state-owned transportation and sales companies should lead private merchants, organize public and private forces, and make full use of existing processing equipment in various regions to carry out planned procurement, processing, and transportation and sales, facing rural factories and mines, and opening up sales channels for aquatic products. Fish markets are administrative management institutions and must not engage in transportation and sales concurrently. The brokerage system should be abolished immediately and management costs should be reduced as much as possible. In terms of controlling market fish prices, the price of one jin of small yellow croaker in the producing area should be no less than 1,000 yuan in 1952, and the major administrative regions should flexibly control the price based on local conditions.

	4. After completing the approved funds, state-owned aquatic enterprises should conscientiously implement the economic accounting system, vigorously increase production and practice economy, tap the potential of existing equipment, increase unit yield, strengthen democratic management, and promote rationalization proposals in order to accumulate funds and expand reproduction.

	5. Carry out aquatic resource surveys and cultivate cadres in a planned way: Local aquatic administrative departments and education and research departments should cooperate with each other, unify steps, and conduct resource surveys separately. In terms of cadre training: In addition to the existing senior aquatic schools, intermediate technical education should be strengthened, short-term training courses for employees should be held, and young fishermen and children of fishermen should be recruited for training.

The instructions finally pointed out: Through the efforts of the past two years, national fishery production has rapidly recovered and approached pre-war levels, proving that China's aquatic industry has a bright future. The people's governments of all regions should arrange work according to the above principles in conjunction with local conditions, and strive to ensure the completion of the 1952 production tasks.

    中央人民政府农业部发布
    关于一九五二年水产工作的指示
    中央人民政府农业部在三月五日发布了关于一九五二年水产工作的指示。指示上说：一九五一年我国的水产事业较前一年有很大的发展。根据去年的生产计划，水产完成了生产任务的百分之一百一十三点八，我国水产已恢复到战前水平的百分之八十三。
    指示指出：一九五二年全国水产工作的方针应该是：大力发展淡水养殖，稳步提高海洋生产；加强渔民组织，改进技术，提高单位产量，使我国水产恢复到战前的水平，并争取超过战前水平百分之一十三点三三。为了完成今年的水产任务，各地须做好以下几件工作：
    一、组织起来，改进技术，提高产量：各大行政区和省人民政府必须在春汛以前动员与组织渔民作好准备工作，加强对渔港渔村的生产领导，发动渔民组织互助合作，开展生产竞赛运动，在原有基础上，培养一批新的渔业劳动模范和典型生产互助组，树立起新的生产旗帜，并推广生产经验，改进生产技术，以求普遍提高单位产量。还有封建剥削势力的渔区，应采取适当措施发动渔民进行民主改革，解放生产力。海上有敌匪骚扰的地方，需组织渔民自卫，采取劳武结合的办法，与海防密切联系，加强沿海护渔工作。
    二、恢复已有淡水湖、沼、池、塘的渔业生产，大力开辟和发展养殖面积，并提倡利用农田灌溉沟渠和稻田养鱼，作为农村副业。各大行政区人民政府应制定渔业管理办法，认真保护水产繁殖，确定淡水水面的利用及所有权，采取公营、私营、公私合营、集体生产等各种经营方式，进行养殖生产。对鱼苗的生产和供应，人民政府应实行有计划的统一管理。拥有广大水面的各省，应设立示范养鱼场和鱼种场，进行试育优良品种，防治病害的工作，指导群众养鱼。
    三、在水产的加工、运销业务上，各公营运销公司应领导私商，组织公私力量，尽量利用各地原有加工设备，作有计划地收购、加工和运销，面向农村厂矿，开辟水产销路。鱼市场为行政管理机构，不得兼营运销，应即取消经纪人制度，尽量减低管理费用。市场鱼价的掌握上，一九五二年以产区小黄鱼为标准，要保持斤鱼不低于一千元的价格，并由各大行政区依据当地情况机动掌握。
    四、国营水产企业在完成核定资金以后，应认真实行经济核算制度，厉行增产节约，发挥原有设备的潜在能力，提高单位产量，加强民主管理，推动合理化建议，以期积累资金，扩大再生产。
    五、进行水产资源调查工作，有计划地培养干部：各地水产行政部门和教育研究部门应互相配合，统一步骤，分别进行资源调查工作。干部训练方面：除已有的高级水产学校外，要加强中等技术教育，举办职工短期训练班，吸收青年渔工及渔民子弟加以训练。
    指示最后指出：全国渔业生产，经两年来的努力，已迅速恢复并接近战前水平，证明我国水产事业是有远大前途的。各地人民政府应根据以上原则结合当地情况，布置工作，为保证完成一九五二年生产任务而努力。
