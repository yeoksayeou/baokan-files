    Self-Criticism Regarding Neglecting the Promotion of "Resist America, Aid Korea" Films
    Comrades Editors: The criticism made by Comrade Wang Shiji in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on January 21st regarding our neglect of promoting "Resist America, Aid Korea" films is correct. We sincerely accept this criticism and guarantee to avoid repeating similar errors in our future work.
    Upon reviewing our work, we found that we did not attach importance to the film "Resist America, Aid Korea," which has significant political importance, neither ideologically nor in practice. Before its release, we did not prepare to consciously promote this film and organize more people to see it. During and after the screening period, we also failed to give the film the publicity it deserved. When handling news related to this film, we did not place it in a prominent position on the newspaper page. The comrade responsible for advertising even squeezed the advertisement for the "Resist America, Aid Korea" film to make room for other advertisements. What is particularly serious is that after the People's Daily readers criticized our mistakes, we did not promptly conduct a review. Some comrades even considered this only a "minor flaw," claiming that the publicity for this film was already "much stronger" than that for other films. This statement proves that some comrades' attitude towards criticism is not serious, and these shortcomings should be corrected promptly.
    The "Resist America, Aid Korea" film demonstrates the great patriotism and internationalism of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Many viewers were moved to tears while watching it, and it played a role in promoting the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign. However, due to our lack of political enthusiasm, we adopted a cold attitude towards the promotion of this film, resulting in political losses. We will definitely learn from this lesson, improve our political and ideological level, and strive to enhance the ideological content of the newspaper.

### 山西日报编辑部  对忽视宣传“抗美援朝”影片的检讨

    对忽视宣传“抗美援朝”影片的检讨
    编辑同志：今年一月二十一日人民日报读者来信栏中发表的王世吉同志对我们忽视宣传“抗美援朝”影片的批评，是正确的。我们诚恳地接受这个批评，保证在今后工作中避免重犯类似错误。
    我们检查了一下，我们不论从思想上和实际工作中，都对“抗美援朝”这部具有重大政治意义的影片，没有重视起来。在放映前，我们并未准备有意识地去宣传这部影片，组织更多的群众去看；在放映期间和放映以后，也没有对该影片作应有的宣传。在处理有关这个影片的新闻时，没有放到报纸版面上应有的重要位置，负责广告工作的同志，把“抗美援朝”影片的广告挤下来，换上其他广告。尤其严重的是，当人民日报读者对我们这种错误进行批评后，我们并未迅速进行检查，有些同志还认为这只是“美中不足”，对这部影片，比对其他影片的宣传已经是“强的多了”。这种说法，证明某些同志对待批评的态度是不严肃的，这些缺点应迅速改正。
    “抗美援朝”影片，表现了中国人民志愿军伟大的爱国主义和国际主义精神，许多观众看了这部影片都感动得流泪，它对抗美援朝的工作起了推动作用。但我们由于政治热情不高，所以对于这一影片的宣传就采取了冷淡的态度，造成了政治上的损失。我们一定接受这个教训，提高我们的政治思想水平，为提高报纸的思想性而努力。
