    Capitalists of Southern Jiangsu Silk Filatures Persecute Female Workers
    Relevant Authorities Should Immediately Inspect and Stop This
    Comrade Editor: Last September, I saw many facts of female workers in Southern Jiangsu silk filatures being oppressed by law-breaking capitalists. Zhang Zhide, a female worker at Xiangji Silk Filature, had blisters on her chest from being scalded by the capitalist. She cried when she saw us but dared not speak. She feared that if she spoke of the capitalist's crimes, she would be scalded even more severely in the future. The law-breaking capitalists of Hengda Silk Filature, in order to blur the workers' class consciousness, forced employees to buy shares, with the share money deducted from their wages. The law-breaking capitalist of Qixin Silk Filature colluded with his running dog—the union chairman Wu Zhongxin—to slow down the clock, extend working hours, and exploit the workers. The sanitation work in many factories is very poor. Factories such as Sanfeng and Jiufeng have neither dormitories nor cafeterias. Even the relatively large silk filatures only have cafeterias for the reeling workers, but they can only rinse their rice with hot water and eat it with a little cold salted vegetables. As a result, many suffer from stomach ailments. Xiangji Silk Filature arranges the machines very densely, the workshop is damp, and the air is bad. Female worker You Caipei contracted dampness poisoning, her body festered, she had no strength to seek treatment, and still went to work despite her illness. Toilet facilities and temperature regulation are also unreasonable. The workshop temperature of Qixin Silk Filature reached 118 degrees. The law-breaking capitalists of some silk filatures ordered the foremen to beat and scold the workers, with as many as sixty-four kinds of insulting names. Today, we workers are the masters of our own house, and we will never allow female workers to be abused by law-breaking capitalists again. I request the Southern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office to inspect these law-breaking capitalists and require them to improve the facilities.

    苏南缫丝厂资本家迫害女工
    有关机关应该立即检查制止
    编辑同志：去年九月，我在苏南看到许多缫丝厂女工受违法资本家压迫的事实。祥记丝厂女工张治弟的胸部被资方烫的起了大泡，她一见我们就哭，但不敢讲。她怕说了资方的罪行，以后更要挨烫。恒达丝厂违法资本家为了模糊工人的阶级意识，强迫职工入股，股金由工资内扣除。企新丝厂违法资本家勾结他的走狗——工会主席吴中心，拨慢钟点，延长工作时间，剥削工人。很多厂的卫生工作做得很差。三丰、九丰等厂既无宿舍也无饭堂。比较大的丝厂也只有立缫工有饭堂，但她们也只能把饭用热水冲一下，就一点冷咸菜吃，这样，得胃病的很多。祥记丝厂把机器排得很密，车间潮湿，空气恶劣。女工游才培中了湿毒，身上溃烂，无力治疗，依然力疾上班。厕所设备与温度的调节也是不合理的，企新丝厂的车间温度竟达到一百十八度。有的丝厂的违法资本家命令管车的打骂工人，辱骂的名称有六十四种之多。今天我们工人已当了家，我们决不容许女工再受到违法资本家的虐待。我要求苏南人民行政公署检查这些违法资本家，并要他们改善设备。严荣
