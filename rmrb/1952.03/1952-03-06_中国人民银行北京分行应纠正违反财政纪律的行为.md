    The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China Should Correct Violations of Financial Discipline
    Editor: The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China and the Head Office of the Bank of Communications have engaged in serious violations of financial discipline, such as unauthorized lending and arbitrary unfreezing of funds deposited in banks. When the Beijing Tram Company borrowed money from the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China to order new vehicle materials, it obtained a loan from the business department of the Beijing Branch without the monetary income and expenditure plan being reviewed by the Finance Bureau (authorized by the Municipal People's Government to be reviewed and approved by the Municipal Finance and Economic Committee on behalf of the Municipal Finance Department). The Beijing Branch also arbitrarily unfroze over 380 million yuan of the Tram Company's outstanding unpaid capital construction funds that the Municipal Finance and Economic Committee had decided to freeze, directly transferring it to the Bank of Communications. Only after the income and expenditure were completed did the Bank of Communications send a letter to the Finance Bureau for retroactive approval. After learning about this matter, the Finance Bureau notified the Bank of Communications to stop paying the Tram Company and ordered the Tram Company to stop using the funds. The Tram Company invited the responsible comrades from the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, the business department of the Head Office of the Bank of Communications, and the business department of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China to the Finance Bureau to discuss a solution. Wang, the section chief of the business department of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, and Comrade Mu, not only did not accept everyone's opinions and admit their mistakes, but hastily left, making it impossible to resolve the issue.
    In the past year, the People's Bank of China in Beijing has repeatedly violated the monetary management system. This makes it easy for embezzlers to exploit loopholes. We hope that the Beijing Branch will conduct a thorough inspection of this matter and completely correct this error.

    中国人民银行北京分行应纠正违反财政纪律的行为
    编辑同志：中国人民银行北京分行和交通银行总管理处有擅自借贷、随意解冻结存银行的资金等严重违反财政纪律的行为。北京市电车公司在向中国人民银行北京分行借款订购新车用料时，其货币收支计划未经财政局审核（经市人民政府授权财政局代市财政经济委员会核批），即从北京分行营业部取得贷款。北京分行还把市财政经济委员会决定冻结电车公司的应付未付的基本建设余款三亿八千多万元随意解冻，径转交通银行，直到收支完毕后，才由交通银行函转财政局追认。财政局知道了这件事情，就通知交通银行停止向电车公司付款，并要电车公司停止动用。电车公司邀请市公用局、交通银行总管理处营业部和人民银行北京分行营业部负责同志，到财政局面商解决。人民银行北京分行营业部王股长和穆同志，不但不接受大家的意见，承认错误，竟匆匆而去，致使问题无法解决。
    一年以来，北京市人民银行曾屡次发生不遵守货币管理制度的现象，这样很容易给贪污分子钻空子。希望北京分行对此作一次深入检查，彻底纠正这种错误。
