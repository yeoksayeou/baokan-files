The news that the American invading forces, disregarding the just warnings of the people of our country and the world, have recently been continuously spreading bacteria in the northeastern region of our country has aroused extreme anger among the people of the capital. Readers from all walks of life have written to this newspaper, expressing their strongest protest against this mad behavior of U.S. imperialism, which violates justice and humanity and contravenes international law. An Rui Xia of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League wrote: The act of the American aggressors in dispatching aircraft to continuously spread bacteria in Northeast China shows that the American aggressors have completely lost their humanity. They are the ugliest, most brutal, most savage, and most shameless group of beasts in the world. Reader Shao Tianren pointed out: The American aggressors' attempt to achieve victory through plague is a delusion, and will only further arouse our anger and accelerate their demise. Zhang Zhilong and others from the Beijing Electric Power Bureau believe that the American aggressors' attempt to intimidate the Chinese people by such despicable means when they cannot reverse the failure of the war of aggression against Korea and are rendered speechless in the armistice negotiations is completely futile. Zheng Binkui of Beijing Agricultural University wrote: We protest to the American aggressors with extreme anger. We must expose this heinous crime of U.S. imperialism to the people of the world. We believe that we have sufficient strength to crush this insidious plot. In addition to angrily protesting the crime of American aircraft invading Northeast China to spread bacteria, all readers expressed their determination to oppose germ warfare in their letters. All the students of Class 52A of the Beijing University School of Medicine wrote to the Minister of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, requesting that the glorious task of sterilizing and preventing epidemics to defend the motherland be entrusted to them first, so that they could go to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare. The students of the Mining Group of the Beijing University of Foreign Trade requested to immediately study epidemic prevention work. All teachers and students of the Department of Zoology and Department of Botany of Peking University, and all the students of the second grade of the Department of Chemistry of Fu Jen Catholic University also expressed the same wishes. Zhu Yulian of World Knowledge Publishing House and others suggested that the government immediately organize epidemic prevention organizations and vigorously publicize epidemic prevention knowledge to the people of the whole country. All the teachers, students and staff of Beijing Normal University, all the teachers, students and staff of Beijing No. 5 Girls' Middle School, and other broad readers have expressed in seminars, wall newspapers, or signatures that they are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and are willing to contribute everything to defend the motherland and crush the US germ warfare. The students of Beijing No. 2 Girls' Middle School will go to the streets to conduct propaganda on "March 8th" to tell the broad masses of people about this shameless crime of American imperialism. Chang Jie and others of the Work Group of the Economy Inspection Committee of the Seventh District of Beijing are determined to do a good job in the anti-corruption and anti-theft work and respond to the provocation of the American aggressors with practical actions. The students of Grades Two and Three of Yu Ying Middle School sent 22,000 yuan to this newspaper to be forwarded to the Chinese People's Volunteers to buy some anti-epidemic medicines.
