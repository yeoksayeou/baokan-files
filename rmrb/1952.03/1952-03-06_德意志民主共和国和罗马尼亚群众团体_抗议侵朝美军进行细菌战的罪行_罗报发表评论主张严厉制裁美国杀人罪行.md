    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 5th: The crime of the American aggressors in conducting germ warfare in Korea has aroused great indignation in the German Democratic Republic. Professor Linse, Chairman of the Aid Korea Committee of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany, issued a declaration on the 3rd, protesting the crime of the American aggressors in conducting germ warfare and calling on the German people to intensify their support for the Korean people. The declaration stated: People all over the world are shocked and indignant at the news they have seen in the newspapers that the American army is using the time of the Korean armistice negotiations to start germ warfare. The American interventionists, unable to destroy the Korean fighters fighting for liberation, are now resorting to such despicable means, using epidemics to kill civilians, in an attempt to achieve their imperialist goals. For the sake of humanity, for the sake of all mankind, we must fight this crime with all our strength.
    The declaration emphasized: The Aid Korea Committee of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany firmly protests against the United States' use of this barbaric and inhumane new means. The use of such criminal means by the United States and its vassal states is simply an unprecedented disgrace to human civilization. The Aid Korea Committee of the National Council calls on all peace-loving people to intensify their vigorous support for the Korean people who are fighting for freedom, in order to express their angry protest against this crime. We also call on all German patriots in cities and villages to express their support for the Korean brothers and sisters and to provide them with practical assistance.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: Mass organizations in Romania have sent telegrams to the United Nations, protesting the crime of the American aggressors in conducting germ warfare. According to the Romanian News Agency, Bucharest, March 4th: The Permanent Committee for the Defense of Peace of the Romanian People's Republic sent a telegram to the United Nations Security Council, stating: The more than eleven million peace defenders of the Romanian People's Republic hereby declare the prohibition of the use of weapons of mass slaughter of peaceful people, and express their utmost indignation at the atrocities of the American imperialist aggressors in conducting germ warfare against the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The American imperialists have launched large-scale germ warfare against women, the elderly, and innocent children in the Korean War, destroying international treaties and the most basic humanitarian standards. We demand that the United Nations Security Council do its utmost to intervene in this matter, so that the germ warfare shamefully carried out in Korea under the banner of the United Nations can be terminated immediately.
    In addition, the Central Committee of the Romanian People's Republic Labor Youth League also sent a telegram to the United Nations, protesting against the use of germ warfare weapons by the American interventionists against the peaceful people of Korea.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: Romanian News Agency reported: All Romanian newspapers published the statements by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression, denouncing the crime of American aggressors using bacteriological weapons in Korea. Newspapers also published commentaries and articles and statements by scientists and cultural workers, denouncing this despicable action of the American aggressors. "Spark" wrote: The statement of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai is a stern condemnation of the most despicable, most barbaric, and most bloody enemy of peace and mankind – the American imperialists. The statements of Zhou Enlai and Korean Foreign Minister Park Hon-yong announced to all mankind the most appalling crimes committed by the American aggressors in Korea. The bestial image of the American imperialists is more hideous than ever before in the eyes of the people of the world, and their crimes and lawlessness have surpassed their ancestor – the Nazi fascists. Everyone who loves life and peace will be unable to suppress the infinite anger in their hearts when they see these lawless acts. Let us, together with the people of the world, launch a huge wave of protests against this human demon, stop their unprecedented lawless acts, and let us tightly restrain their evil hands that are attacking the world.
    "Free Romania" published an article saying: Our people, together with the Korean and Chinese people and the honest people of the world, resolutely protest against the crimes committed by the American imperialists on the suffering land of Korea. The Romanian people believe that the American imperialists are the most hateful enemies of mankind, and they demand international sanctions against the criminal aggressors who dare to use bacteriological weapons in Korea.
    Professor Kerndler, Director of the "Pavlov" Institute of Neurology and Academician of the Academy of Sciences, wrote: Today, when honest scientific workers who work to defend the lives of the people are doing their best to discover new methods to serve the most sublime ideals of civilization, the American aggressors are using the most hateful means. Scientists who serve peace and progress condemn the lawless acts committed by the American aggressors in Korea. At a meeting held at the "Dr. Cantacuzino" Institute in Bucharest, scientific workers, microbiologists, chemists, natural scientists, and staff and technicians of the institute protested against the barbaric means of using bacteriological weapons in Korea by the American imperialists.

    宣言强调说：民主德国全国阵线全国委员会援朝委员会坚决抗议美国使用这种野蛮的不人道的新手段。美国和它的附庸国使用这种罪恶手段，简直是人类文明的空前耻辱。全国委员会援朝委员会号召全体爱好和平的人民加紧大力声援为争取自由而斗争的朝鲜人民，借以表示对这种罪行的愤怒抗议。我们并号召全德国城市和农村的爱国者对朝鲜的兄弟姊妹们表示声援，并实地援助他们。

    此外，罗马尼亚人民共和国劳动青年联盟中央委员会也打电报给联合国，抗议美国干涉者对朝鲜和平人民使用细菌战武器。
    【新华社五日讯】罗马尼亚通讯社消息：全罗马尼亚的报纸都刊载了中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来和中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若斥责美国侵略者在朝鲜使用细菌武器的罪行的声明。各报并纷纷发表评论以及科学家与文化工作者的文章和声明，痛斥美国侵略者这种卑鄙的行动。“火花报”写道：周恩来外交部长的声明，是对和平与人类的最卑鄙、最野蛮、最血腥的敌人——美帝国主义者的严辞声讨。周恩来和朝鲜外务相朴宪永的声明，向全人类宣布了美国侵略者在朝鲜所干下的最骇人的罪行。美帝国主义者的兽性形象，比前此任何时候都更狰狞地暴露于全世界人民的眼前，他们的罪行和无法无天已经超越了他们的祖师——纳粹法西斯分子。每一个热爱生活与和平的人看到这些无法无天的行为，都会压抑不住心中的无比的愤怒。让我们和全世界人民一起，共同向这人类的恶魔掀起巨大的抗议浪潮，制止他们空前无法无天的行为，让我们紧紧掣住他们向全世界进攻的罪恶的手。

    “巴甫洛夫”神经学研究所所长、科学院院士柯伦德勒写道：今天，当为保卫人民的生命而工作的正直的科学工作者正尽他们最大的努力以求发现为最崇高的文明理想而服务的新方法的时候，美国侵略者却在使用最可恨的手段。为和平与进步而服务的科学家斥责美国侵略者在朝鲜干出来的无法无天的行为。在布加勒斯特“坎塔苏金诺博士”研究所举行的会议上，科学工作者、微生物学家、化学家、自然科学家和该研究所的工作人员与技术人员，抗议美帝国主义者在朝鲜使用细菌武器的野蛮手段。
