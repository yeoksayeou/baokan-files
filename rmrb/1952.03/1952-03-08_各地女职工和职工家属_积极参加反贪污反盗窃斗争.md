Throughout the country, female employees and employees' families in factories and enterprises actively participate in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, as well as the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence.

The broad masses of female employees and employees' families have plunged into this struggle with a high degree of class consciousness and selfless patriotic enthusiasm. Female employees of the Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau, together with male workers, take on propaganda, investigation, and security work in the struggle. Ma Runying and Zhang Cailan, members of the Communist Youth League at the Taibei Locomotive Depot of the sub-bureau, discovered that a major embezzler selling coal was throwing a seal into the stove in an attempt to destroy evidence. They bravely retrieved the seal from the stove with their bare hands. Zhou Jifang, a female worker in the explosives warehouse of the Fushun Mining Bureau open-pit mine in Northeast China, entrusted her child to others so she could concentrate on the struggle.

In the struggle, they are not only brave and resolute but also resourceful. Chen Xiucen, an accountant in the Finance Section of the Shanghai Railway Sub-bureau, carefully studied the materials after receiving the task of capturing the big "tiger" Deng Shaozhou (engineer of the ferry stock), and found that Deng Shaozhou had close ties with Li Chengxiong, the owner of Shanghai Xieda Hardware Store. Through the store employees' union, she obtained the help of an active store employee and finally exposed Deng Shaozhou's crime of embezzling more than 120 million yuan. Han Baojuan, of the Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau Taiyuan Station, led the service section team at the station to fight the "tigers" by using the method of holding "Zhuge Liang meetings" to study the "enemy situation," discovering what the corrupt elements were afraid of and attacking those areas; thus, they successively captured four large and small corrupt elements.

They not only actively participate in the struggle themselves but also encourage relevant people to actively participate. After Li Yaozong, a worker at the Yongdingmen Station of the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau, was hired as an inspection committee member in the anti-corruption movement, he failed to devote 100% of his energy to inspection work because he was afraid of offending people. His wife, Liu Yulan, criticized him when she learned of this, saying, "How can you work like this? You are treating the matter of saving people as something that offends people." She urged her husband to take responsibility. After listening to his wife's words, Li Yaozong became very active, later working until eleven or twelve o'clock every night before going home.

Female employees recognize that this struggle is a serious class struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie and are actively launching a resolute struggle against law-breaking capitalists. Xing Guizhen, an old female worker at the Tianjin private North China Rubber Factory, is the chairman of the factory's trade union. At the beginning of the anti-theft movement, under the leadership of the Party, she began to mobilize the masses. At the first employees' meeting, the masses immediately reported twenty-four illegal acts by Cai Chunyu, the illegal capitalist of the factory. However, Cai Chunyu refused to confess and colluded with two deputy managers and employee Liang Mingtang to form an "offensive and defensive alliance," attempting to resist the movement. Xing Guizhen focused on educating Liang Mingtang, explaining the policy to Liang and explaining the advantages and disadvantages. Liang Mingtang finally woke up, revealed the inside story of the "offensive and defensive alliance," and exposed some of Cai Chunyu's illegal activities. Based on these materials, Xing Guizhen and all the factory's employees further investigated, exposing the true colors of this big "tiger" who had embezzled 3.715 billion yuan of state property by means of tax evasion and shoddy workmanship. Fang Huiling, a female accountant at Shanghai Shuntai Cai Ji Hardware Store, realized in the anti-theft movement that it was everyone's responsibility to report dishonest merchants. She joined forces with the store employees to fire on the illegal capitalists. For example, the capitalist forged purchase invoices and withdrew funds, and also attempted to cover up, but was exposed by everyone. The store employees have now reported eighty-three illegal acts by the capitalists, forcing the capitalists to confess some facts.

In the struggle, the political awareness of female employees and employees' families has been greatly improved. Stories of them reporting their relatives and persuading them to make a thorough confession can be found everywhere. Thirty wives of railway employees in Manzhouli, Northeast China, have already reported their husbands. Jiang Shukun, a female worker at the San San Cigarette Factory in Baoding, had a husband named He Songtao who was an accountant and warehouse manager at the Hebei Provincial Taxation Bureau Printing Factory and had embezzled 500 million yuan in stamp taxes in 1950. This year, during the Spring Festival, Jiang Shukun was cleaning the room and found a package of stamp taxes in He Songtao's luggage. She sent these tax stamps to the director of the printing factory. At this point, this major embezzlement case, which had lasted for a year and a half, was finally exposed. The wife of Wang Xishan, a worker at the Qingdao Shipyard, remembered that the money her husband brought home in the past was more than his salary, and knew that there must be embezzlement. She persuaded her husband, saying, "A confession will reunite the family, but if you are reported without confessing, you will be separated from your wife and children." As a result, her husband thoroughly confessed the fact that he had stolen and sold 180 catties of state-owned copper bars, 150 catties of lead skin, 45 catties of rivets, and 50 catties of copper plates. Liu Jinghe, a corrupt element at the Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 5, refused to confess. Liu Jinghe's wife, Zhang Huilan, just had a son and ran to the factory in the wind and snow to persuade Liu Jinghe to confess. Liu initially confessed to embezzling 40 million yuan. Zhang Huilan told him, "It's not thorough enough. You once brought home 20 million yuan. Where did that money come from?" Liu Jinghe had to confess another 20 million yuan of embezzlement.

Mothers also strictly supervise their sons to confess. Liu Yiji of the Shenyang Mechanical Pressure Factory embezzled and accepted bribes, and formed an "offensive and defensive alliance" with Wang Ying'an, the director of the factory, refusing to confess. His mother repeatedly educated him, and finally told him, "If you don't confess, I won't have you as a son." Under his mother's persuasion, Liu Yiji confessed to accepting more than 30 million yuan in bribes and exposed the fact that Wang Ying'an colluded with dishonest merchants.

When employees' families are organized, dishonest merchants and corrupt elements have no gaps to exploit. The family committee of the 38th group of Shenyang South Station often holds meetings to study the living conditions and social relationships of each family. Hu Mingyi, the head of the security team of the committee, often saw a fat businessman go to the home of Han Zongchun, the procurement officer of the Materials Department of the Northeast Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Railways. She became particularly vigilant. One day, this fat businessman went to Han Zongchun's home to make an "offensive and defensive alliance," and was caught by Hu Mingyi and the families after he came out, solving an embezzlement case. Sun Jingmin, a family member of a worker at the Shenyang Machine Factory No. 1, found that the factory accountant Gao Peiru had a monthly salary of 190 points, a family of eight, lived very wealthy, added "Ajinomoto" even to tofu, and bought more than ten catties of meat at a time. She reported this situation to the factory leadership, and after investigation, Gao Peiru was indeed a major corrupt element.

The "March 8th" International Working Women's Day is coming, and many female employees and employees' families have proposed to further participate in the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle. Yang Zhufen of the Chengdu Posts and Telecommunications Bureau said to the female employees in the bureau, "Women's Day is coming soon, I must make greater efforts to participate in the current class struggle and use practical actions to welcome the 'March 8th' festival." The female employees of the Zhangjiakou Railway Factory have made a plan to strive to make meritorious contributions in the anti-corruption movement as a gift to the "March 8th" festival.

    各地女职工和职工家属
    积极参加反贪污反盗窃斗争
    各地工厂企业广大妇女职工和职工家属，积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争和反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争。
    广大的妇女职工和职工家属都以高度的阶级觉悟和忘我的爱国热情投进这一斗争。太原铁路分局的女职工和男工人一道，分别担任斗争中的宣传、侦察、保卫等工作。该分局太北机务段女青年团员马润英和张彩兰，在作纠察工作时发现盗卖煤炭的大贪污犯把图章扔进火炉里，企图毁灭罪证，她们就奋不顾身，用手把图章从火炉里取出来。东北抚顺矿务局露天矿火药库女工周继芳，为了集中精力进行斗争，把她的孩子交给别人照管。
    在斗争中，她们不仅勇敢、坚决，而且机智。上海铁路分局财务科会计员陈岫岑，在接到捕捉大“老虎”邓少周（轮渡股工程师）的任务后，细心研究材料，发觉邓少周和上海协大五金号老板李澄雄往来密切。她通过店员工会，得到协大五金号一位积极店员的帮助，终于揭露了邓少周贪污一亿二千多万元的罪行。太原铁路分局太原车站韩宝娟领导该站服务处小组打“虎”，用开“诸葛亮会议”的方法，研究“敌情”，发现贪污分子怕什么，就向什么地方进攻；因此连续捕获了大小贪污分子四名。
    她们不仅自己积极参加斗争，还推动有关的人积极参加斗争。北京铁路分局永定门车站工人李耀宗在反贪污运动中被聘为检查委员后，因怕得罪人，没能拿出百分之百的精力来进行检查工作。他的老婆刘玉兰知道了，就批评他说：“你这样还能工作吗？把挽救人的事看作是得罪人的事。”劝她丈夫要负起责任来。李耀宗听了老婆的话后，就表现很积极，后来每天夜里工作到十一、二点还不回家。
    女职工认识到这一斗争是工人阶级和资产阶级的一场严重的阶级斗争，积极向违法资本家展开坚决的斗争。天津私营华北橡胶厂老女工邢桂珍，是该厂的工会主席。反盗窃运动一开始，她就在党的领导下，着手发动群众。在第一次职工大会上，群众一下检举了该厂违法资本家蔡春雨二十四件违法事实。蔡春雨却拒不坦白，拉拢两个副理和职员梁铭堂订立“攻守同盟”，妄图抵抗运动。邢桂珍就抓紧教育梁铭堂，向梁讲解政策，说明利害。梁铭堂终于觉悟过来，谈出了“攻守同盟”的内幕，揭露了蔡春雨的部分违法行为。邢桂珍和全厂职工根据这些材料，进一步追究，使这个曾利用偷漏国税、偷工减料等办法盗窃国家资财三十七亿一千五百万元的大“老虎”，暴露了真面目。上海顺泰才记五金号女会计方荟苓在反盗窃运动中认识到检举奸商是每个人的责任，她联合店内职工向违法资方开火。如资本家假造进货发票，抽走资金，还企图掩盖，被大家揭发了。该号职工现在已检举资方违法行为八十三件，迫使资本家不得不坦白一些事实。
    在斗争中，女职工和职工家属的政治觉悟大大提高。她们检举她们的亲人和规劝她们的亲人彻底坦白的事，到处都有。东北满洲里铁路职工家属就已有三十个妻子检举了自己的丈夫。保定市三三烟厂女工蒋淑坤的丈夫何松涛，是河北省税务局印刷厂的会计兼管库员，曾在一九五○年盗窃印花税票五亿元。今年过春节时，蒋淑坤打扫房间，发现何松涛的一个包袱里有很多印花税票。她就把这些税票送给印刷厂厂长。到这时，这个为时一年半的大贪污案终于被揭发了。青岛造船厂王锡山的老婆想起她丈夫过去拿回家的钱比他的工资数多，知道其中一定有贪污。她便劝她丈夫说：“坦白了家庭会团圆，不坦白被检举了就要妻离子散。”结果她丈夫把盗卖国家铜条一百八十斤、铅皮一百五十斤、铆钉四十五斤、铜版五十斤的事实彻底坦白了。沈阳橡胶五厂贪污分子刘景和不肯坦白，刘景和的老婆张惠兰刚生了儿子，就冒着大风雪跑到厂里，劝刘景和坦白。刘初步坦白了贪污四千万元。张惠兰就对他说：“还不彻底。你有一次拿回家两千万元，那钱是从那里来的？”刘景和不得不又说出了贪污两千万元。
    母亲也严格地督促儿子坦白。沈阳机械压力厂刘义基贪污受贿，并和该厂厂长王营安订了“攻守同盟”，拒不坦白。他的母亲就再三教育他，最后告他说：“你要是不坦白，我就当没有你这个儿子。”刘义基在母亲的劝诫下，坦白了受贿三千多万元，并揭穿了王营安和奸商勾结的事实。
    职工家属们组织起来，便使奸商、贪污分子没有空隙可乘。沈阳南站第三十八组家属委员会，常开会研究各家的生活情况和社会关系。该会保卫组长胡明宜常看到一个大胖子商人到铁道部东北特派员办事处材料部采购员韩宗春的家去，她就特别警惕起来。有一天这个大胖子商人到韩宗春家去订“攻守同盟”，出来后便被胡明宜和家属们抓住了，破获了一件贪污案。沈阳机器一厂工人家属孙敬民发现该厂会计高佩儒每月工资一百九十分，一家八口，生活很富裕，吃豆腐还要放“味滋素”，买肉一次就是十来斤。她把这个情况反映给该厂领导方面，经过检查，高佩儒确是一个大贪污犯。
    “三八”国际劳动妇女节到来了，许多女职工和职工家属都提出要进一步参加反贪污、反盗窃斗争。成都市邮电局杨竹芬向局内女职工说：“妇女节快到了，我一定要尽更大的努力参加当前的阶级斗争，用实际行动来迎接‘三八’节。”张家口铁路工厂的女职工订出计划，争取在反贪污运动中立功，作为对“三八”节的献礼。
