    Reading Groups Across the Country Protest American Imperialism's Spreading of Germs
    In the past half-month, this newspaper has received letters from 486 reading group members across the country, protesting the heinous crime of the American aggressor troops spreading germs in Korea and northeastern China. These letters fully demonstrate the Chinese people's determination and confidence to crush the enemy, the American aggressors' germ warfare.
    The Luan Feng Reading Group of the Heilongjiang Medical School wrote: "Our school's faculty, staff, and over 600 students, after seeing and hearing the news on newspapers and radio about the American aggressor troops violating international law and spreading germs in Korea and northeastern China, all gnashed our teeth in hatred. The inhuman and brutal American aggressors' launching of germ warfare symbolizes the death throes of imperialism!" The letter earnestly stated: "We are ready at any time to answer the motherland's call (some people have already written letters of determination to the organization), to go to the front lines of the anti-germ warfare, and resolutely strike at American imperialism!"
    The Shuncheng Street Elementary School Teachers' Reading Group in the Fifth District of Beijing wrote: "After we explained the news of the American aggressor troops spreading germs to the children, more than 800 innocent and pure children clenched their small fists in anger and said: We will definitely be able to drive American imperialism back to its home, we can use medicine to kill the germs!" The teachers also voluntarily went to nearby streets and alleys to publicize the American bandits' crimes to the masses. The Reading Group of the Beihai Experimental Nursery in Beijing wrote that they would use practical actions of "increasing production and practicing thrift" to protest the American bandits' crimes, and submitted 1,020,700 yuan in Renminbi, requesting this newspaper to forward it to the anti-epidemic team at the Korean front (Editor's note: This amount has been transferred to the relevant department).
    The twelve reading groups of Nanguan Street in the First District of Zhengyang County, Henan, jointly wrote: In the first three days of March, we successively held symposiums with more than 300 people. Through the symposiums, everyone recognized the reasons why the American bandits have been delaying the armistice negotiations for a long time. The letter said: "The American aggressor troops are妄想wanting to threaten us with germ warfare, which is really overestimating themselves."

    各地读报组抗议美帝国主义撒布细菌
    最近半个月以来，本报收到各地读报组组员四百八十六人的来信，抗议美国侵略军在朝鲜和我国东北地区撒布细菌的滔天罪行。这些信，充分表现了中国人民粉碎敌人美国侵略者细菌战的决心和信心。
    黑龙江省医士学校栾枫读报组来信说：“我们全校教职员工和学生六百多人，在报纸上、广播中看到和听到美国侵略军违反国际公法，在朝鲜和我国东北地区撒布细菌的消息后，都恨得咬牙切齿。灭绝人性、惨无人道的美国侵略者发动细菌战，象征着帝国主义的垂死挣扎！”信里恳切地说：“我们随时都等待着祖国的召唤（有些人已向组织上写了决心书），走上反细菌战的最前线，坚决打击美帝国主义！”
    北京五区顺城街小学教师读报组来信说：“我们把美国侵略军撒布细菌的消息，向儿童们说明了以后，八百多个天真纯朴的孩子，都愤恨地捏着小拳头说：我们一定能把美帝国主义打回老家去，我们可以用药水杀死细菌！”教师们并自动地到附近街巷中向群众宣传美国强盗的这种罪行。北京市北海实验托儿所的读报组来信说：他们要用“增产节约”的实际行动来抗议美国强盗的罪行，并交来人民币一百零二万零七百元，要求本报代转朝鲜前线防疫队（编者按：此款已转有关部门）。
    河南正阳县第一区南关街十二个读报组联名来信说：三月开始的头三天，我们陆续地召开了三百多人的座谈会，通过座谈会，使大家认清了美国强盗长期拖延停战谈判的原因。信中说：“美国侵略军妄想拿细菌战威胁我们，真是太不自量了。”
