The Struggle of Ural Enterprises to Reduce Production Costs

The Soviet journal "Economic Issues," No. 12, 1951, published an article co-authored by Vershinin and Samoilov, pointing out methods for reducing production costs based on the experience of various Ural enterprises in the Soviet Union. The abstract is as follows:

In 1951, a socialist competition to increase labor productivity, make the best use of fixed and circulating capital, improve production technology, improve product quality, and reduce costs gained a wide scale in the machine-building, metallurgical, mining, chemical, and other enterprises of the Urals.

Reducing product costs is one of the most important sources for expanding socialist accumulation in the national economy. In the struggle to reduce product costs, it is extremely important to analyze and utilize all the elements that constitute the cost.

In various industrial sectors, work can be carried out to analyze the composition of product costs. The enterprise staff should focus their efforts on the aspects where consumption factors account for the largest proportion of costs in the struggle to reduce costs. For example, in the cost composition of machine-building enterprises, the main proportions are the consumption of materials and wages; in the ferrous metal industry, the proportion of material consumption is particularly large. Therefore, in the struggle to reduce product costs in machine-building factories and metallurgical factories, saving raw materials and materials, increasing labor productivity, and correctly determining wages are of particular importance.

The level of product costs of various enterprises depends on various different, mutually restrictive, national economic and internal production factors. For example, the reduction of material consumption per unit of production cannot be separated from the adoption of advanced technology and improved technological schemes. Because these schemes can improve the utilization of raw materials, they can also affect the increase of labor productivity. Therefore, the struggle to reduce product costs in enterprises should be comprehensive in nature. In this way, costs can be reduced in all consumption factors, and new potentials for further cost reduction can be found.

After analyzing the various factors affecting cost changes, the potential for reducing product costs was identified. These potentials can be divided into two categories: 1. The potential to further reduce product costs by eliminating unplanned production losses; 2. The potential discovered due to the further improvement of technology and the development of labor organization forms in enterprises.

The experience of the struggle to reduce product costs indicates that when enterprises use these two types of potential, eliminating production losses can make the consumption of products meet the prescribed planned standards, and at the same time, developing technology and improving the organization of production can ensure further reduction of the planned consumption of products.

The cost of a product is the main indicator of the quality of various tasks in an enterprise. All aspects of the enterprise's work are reflected in the cost of the product and its composition. Therefore, the product cost index is one of the bases for evaluating the work of an enterprise.

The cost index is closely linked to other indexes that can form the quality of the enterprise's work. Reducing costs is, first and foremost, the most important source of increasing enterprise benefits, because under the conditions of a certain composition of commodities and a certain level of prices, the amount of accumulation increases in proportion to the reduction in product costs. Therefore, reducing costs is the first and basic condition for increasing enterprise accumulation and increasing benefits. Second, reducing product costs can affect other quality indicators of enterprise work - accelerating capital turnover.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    乌拉尔各企业争取降低产品成本的斗争
    苏联“经济问题”杂志一九五一年第十二期，刊载
    了维尔什宁和萨莫伊洛夫合写的一篇论文，就苏联乌
    拉尔各企业的经验，指出降低产品成本的方法。摘要
    如下：
    一九五一年，在乌拉尔的机器制造、冶金、采矿、化学和其他企业中，争取提高劳动生产率、最好地利用固定资金和流动资金、提高生产技术、改善产品质量和降低成本的社会主义竞赛，获得了广泛的规模。
    降低产品成本，是国民经济中扩大社会主义积累的最重要泉源之一。在争取降低产品成本的斗争中，分析和利用构成成本的全部要素，具有异常重要的意义。
    在各种工业部门，都可以进行分析产品成本的构成的工作。那些消费因素在成本中占比重最大，企业工作人员在争取减低成本的斗争中的努力，就应该指向那一方面。例如，机器建造企业成本构成中的主要比重是材料的消耗和工资；黑色金属业材料的消耗比重特别大。因此，在机器制造工厂和冶金工厂的争取减低产品成本的斗争里，节省原料和材料、提高劳动生产率和正确地核定工资，就具有特殊重要的意义。
    各企业产品成本的水平，依赖于各种最不同的同时互相约制的国民经济的和生产内部的因素。例如，不能把降低每一生产单位材料的消耗和采用先进技术及完善工艺学的方案割断来看。因为这些方案都能改善原料的利用程度，同时可以影响提高劳动生产率。因此，企业中争取减低产品成本的斗争，应该具有全面的性质。这样，可以在各消费因素方面降低成本，并可找出进一步减低成本的新潜力。
    在分析了影响成本变化的各个因素后，找出了减低产品成本的潜力。这些潜力可以分为两类：一、以消灭计划外的生产损失的方法，有进一步减低产品成本的可能性的潜力；二、由于企业中技术的进一步提高和劳动组织形式的发展所发掘出来的潜力。
    争取降低产品成本斗争的经验指出，在企业中利用这两种潜力时，消除生产损失可以使产品的消费达到规定的计划标准，同时发展技术和改善生产的组织，可以保证进一步降低产品的计划消耗量。
    产品的成本是表示企业各种工作质量的主要指标。在产品的成本及其构成中反映着企业工作的各个方面。因此，产品成本的指标是在评价某一企业的工作时的基础之一。
    成本的指数和可以形成企业工作质量方面的其他指数紧密地联系着。降低成本，首先就是提高企业利益的最主要的泉源，因为在商品的一定构成和价格的一定水平的条件下，积累的数量是按照产品成本降低的比例增长的。因此，降低成本是提高企业积累和增加利益的第一个和基本的条件。第二，降低产品成本可以影响企业工作的其他质量指标——加速资金周转。
