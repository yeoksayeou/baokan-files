    Illegal Industrial and Commercial Operators Should Stop Playing Tricks
    At the industrial and commercial community conference held on February 17th, the Beijing Sixth District Thrift Examination Committee, based on the instructions of the Municipal People's Government, announced that lenient treatment would be given to industrial and commercial operators who confessed thoroughly (in addition to paying back the 1951 tax, returning the state-owned funds and materials that were stolen and swindled, and the illegal gains from shoddy workmanship and reduced materials, all fines would be waived, and criminal punishment would be exempted). This has already had an impact in the industrial and commercial community. Many people believe that the People's Government truly means what it says and follows the law. Some industrial and commercial operators who still refuse to confess or whose confessions are not thorough, seeing this clear fact, are beginning to further confess their crimes to the People's Government. Some industrial and commercial operators are breaking personal relationships and reporting the crimes of unscrupulous capitalists they know. Industrial and commercial operators who have received lenient treatment, because they have been relieved of their burdens, are beginning to settle down to production and business, and express their determination to be law-abiding industrial and commercial operators.
    However, up to now, there are still many illegal industrial and commercial operators who are still watching and hesitating, unwilling to honestly confess. They still want to use false confessions to deceive the government in exchange for lenient treatment. They say that in order to "produce", they want the government to quickly deal with their problems, that is, they want the government to immediately announce that there will be no fines and no criminal punishment, so that they can "settle down to production". But they have been unwilling to talk about their own major illegal activities. Some are even continuing to threaten and entice workers and shop assistants, and disperse property. We now want to solemnly tell these people: the government has a large amount of material about your illegal activities; the workers and shop assistants will never be fooled by you and "take the blame" for you. If you are truly willing to settle down to production and do business properly, the only way is to sincerely correct your mistakes, stop threatening and enticing workers and shop assistants, stop dispersing property, and honestly confess all your crimes. If you are still unwilling to do so, and intend to play some "tricks" to muddle through, and vainly hope to get lenient treatment, that is definitely impossible.

### 违法工商业者不要再耍“花枪”了

    违法工商业者不要再耍“花枪”了
    北京市第六区节约检查委员会在二月十七日召开的工商界大会上，根据市人民政府的指示，宣布对坦白彻底的违法工商业者从宽处理（除补缴一九五一年税款，退还盗骗国家的资财和偷工减料等所得赃款外，一律不罚款，并免予刑事处分）后，在工商界中已经发生了影响。许多人认为：人民政府真是说到做到，言出法随。有些至今仍然不肯坦白或坦白不彻底的工商业者，看见这个鲜明的事实，开始进一步向人民政府坦白自己的犯罪行为。有些工商业者打破情面，检举了自己知道的不法资本家的罪行。受到宽大处理的工商业者，因为卸下了包袱，开始安心生产和营业，表示决心做守法的工商业者。
    但是，至今为止，还有许多不法工商业者，仍然在观望犹豫，不肯老老实实地坦白。他们仍然想用假坦白来欺骗政府，换得一个宽大处理。他们说什么为了“生产”，要请政府赶快处理他们的问题，也就是说要政府马上宣布不罚款，不予刑事处分，以便他们能“安心生产”。但对他们自己的重大的违法行为，却一直不肯谈。有的甚至还在继续威胁利诱工人店员，分散财产。我们现在要正告这些人：政府掌握着你们违法行为的大量的材料；工人店员也决不会上你们的当，替你们“背黑锅”了。如果你们真正愿意安心生产、好好做生意，唯一的办法就是真心诚意地改正自己的错误，停止威胁和利诱工人店员，停止分散财产，老老实实地坦白自己的一切罪行。如果仍然不愿意这样做，而打算耍些“花枪”，蒙混过去，妄想得到宽大处理，那是一定办不到的。
