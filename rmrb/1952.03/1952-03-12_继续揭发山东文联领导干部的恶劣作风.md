To the Editor: The bad work styles of Yu Jiyu, former Deputy Director of the Shandong Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Liu Zhixia, Secretary-General, as exposed by readers of the People's Daily, are completely factual. In addition to our complete agreement, we offer some further information:

　　I. Yu Jiyu and Liu Zhixia both regard themselves as "meritorious officials" and are corrupt and degenerate elements who do not seek to improve themselves and crave personal enjoyment. Their most prominent characteristic is that they do no work all year round and indulge in eating, drinking, and having fun. Yu Jiyu never inquired about any work of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, but instead ate and drank every day. In the evening, after getting drunk, he would take a car to the Beiyang Grand Theater to fool around. Sometimes, after the show was over, his enthusiasm for the theater was still not satisfied, so he would call the actresses who had not yet removed their makeup back to the office to perform. Yu's "mansion" was right in the center of the office, with windows facing the road, attracting pedestrians to stop and creating a bustling scene outside the window. Cadres who had worked all day in the office were awakened by their singing, and were filled with annoyance, but dared not speak out.

　　II. Liu Zhixia especially liked to show off his "style." He carried a "carbine" that he had privately obtained from the Huaihai Campaign all day long, looking for birds to shoot, wasting bullets arbitrarily, and disregarding discipline. Liu Zhixia's wife, Liu Su (originally a member of the Art Troupe), often did not work or study, but lived in the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, eating in the medium-sized cafeteria (Liu Su was originally entitled to the large-sized cafeteria), and casually bossed around the office messengers.

　　III. Yu Jiyu and Liu Zhixia rarely participated in political studies or professional studies, and did not get out of bed until "the red sun was high in the sky." Comrades mostly dared not express their opinions. Once, a relatively responsible cadre reflected to Yu Jiyu that everyone had opinions about his sleeping in and not studying (the same was true for the rectification campaign). Yu replied: "You can all treat me as if I am dead." When Liu Zhixia led the work of the editorial department, many errors of principle occurred in "Shandong Literature and Art." He ignored them and went to Qingdao to "escape the summer heat" without authorization. He knew very well that the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Branch of the Communist Party of China was going to hold a propaganda and education conference, but he deliberately avoided attending. He used to be the deputy editor-in-chief of "Shandong Literature and Art," but he never said a word about "how to implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line." He published a miscellaneous essay written by Yu Jiyu that had a principled error, "comparing landlords to cats and hired poor peasants to mice," on the front page of "Shandong Literature and Art" without any consideration.

　　IV. Yu Jiyu liked to play with "goldfish," and Liu Zhixia cheered and encouraged him from the side. The single cost of building fish ponds and buying fish tanks was several million yuan of public funds. He appointed a "goldfish secretary" (Zhou Zhongyu) and three or four messengers to specialize in feeding the fish and selecting and buying various precious goldfish on the streets, and they also had to take turns to fish for fish food in Daming Lake. Yu Jiyu and Liu Zhixia did no work all day long, but sat by the pond to admire the fish. Especially Yu Jiyu, regardless of the scorching sun and wind and rain, would stand by the fish pond for two or three hours. The cadres in the office secretly reflected: Deputy Director Yu cares about the fish more than he cares about one percent of us.

　　V. The work that Yu Jiyu and Liu Zhixia were most interested in was managing the "Daguan Cinema." However, this cinema often took the lead in showing pornographic, vulgar, and poisonous films, such as "The Strange Case of Embroidered Shoes," "The World of Lies," "Double Gun Heroine," and "Foolish Men and Women." Under the guise of the "Federation of Literary and Art Circles," they simply aimed to make profits, regardless of political influence. When the Dazhong Daily forwarded articles criticizing the cinema from readers to Yu Jiyu and Liu Zhixia, they not only did not humbly examine themselves, but instead suppressed democracy and suppressed the publication of the criticism articles. They sacrificed the Party's political influence and were determined to turn the "Daguan Cinema" into a private "cash cow" and "treasury," and the money earned was arbitrarily squandered. In the past, there was always the sound of playing "mahjong" in the Shandong Federation of Literary and Art Circles every night, sometimes one table upstairs and one table downstairs, competing with each other to gamble.

　　In short, Yu Jiyu and Liu Zhixia have turned the Shandong Federation of Literary and Art Circles into an old-fashioned hotel, which is not at all similar to a revolutionary literary and artistic organization. Yu and Liu themselves have been hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie and are becoming increasingly degenerate. We demand that the two of them make a public and profound self-criticism in order to eliminate the bad influence of the Shandong Federation of Literary and Art Circles among the masses.
　　Several Literary Apprentices

　　To the Editor: There have been many public exposures of the extravagant waste and bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. But I think it is necessary to add to this. The responsible cadres of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles have a "mountain stronghold" work style and complacency. They usually do not study literary and artistic policies and literary and artistic works, let alone organize others to study and discuss them. Feng Yizhi, Ding Zhigang, and Liu Zhixia formed a small circle, taking responsibility for but not handling literary and artistic work. The literary and artistic rectification campaign and the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began a long time ago, but Ding Zhigang and Liu Zhixia did not return to the Federation of Literary and Art Circles to lead the movement, nor did they thoroughly examine themselves. Instead, they moved to a quiet place by Daming Lake to avoid the wind and rain, and asked others to "control" the movement, and even euphemistically called it "leaving the office to create." Liu Zhixia, under the pretext of "creation," went to Qingdao last autumn and rented a small western-style building in a scenic area for more than two million yuan a month. He sat in a car all day long, playing and wandering around, eating and drinking, and became brothers with businessmen. In this way, he certainly could not write any literary works. Later, he moved to Daming Lake. Later, because he could not avoid the "wind," he and Ding Zhigang moved back to the office. Comrades in the Federation of Literary and Art Circles discovered many problems and made many suggestions, but Liu Zhixia always squeezed out a little bit to talk about, and complained: "There are no 'tigers' in the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, are you treating me as a 'tiger' object?"

　　When Yu Jiyu was the deputy director of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, he ignored a lot of work and used 500,000 catties of millet to form a Peking Opera troupe. After a few months, this troupe collapsed and disbanded, wasting 500,000 catties of people's millet for nothing. The serious mistakes and shortcomings of the leading cadres of the Shandong Federation of Literary and Art Circles should be thoroughly eliminated from the literary and artistic circles.

### 继续揭发山东文联领导干部的恶劣作风

专栏：

    继续揭发山东文联领导干部的恶劣作风
    编辑同志：人民日报读者所揭发的前任山东文联副主任于寄愚和秘书长刘知侠两人的恶劣作风，完全是事实。我们除完全同意外，再作一些补充：
    一、于寄愚和刘知侠都是以“功臣”自居，不求上进、贪图个人享受的腐化堕落分子。他们突出的表现是成年不做工作，一味吃喝玩乐。于寄愚从来不过问文联任何工作，天天吃酒作乐，到了傍晚，喝得酩酊大醉，就坐着小汽车，开往北洋大戏院去胡混。有时散戏以后，他的戏瘾还没有过足，就把未下妆的女演员叫回机关唱戏。于的“公馆”正在机关的中心，窗子面临马路，惹得行人止步，窗外若市。机关里工作了一天的干部，被他们唱醒，一肚子的烦恼，敢怒而不敢言。
    二、刘知侠特别喜欢讲“派头”。他成天背着从淮海战役中私自弄来的“卡宾枪”，到处找鸟打，任意浪费子弹，不顾纪律。刘知侠的爱人刘苏（原文工团团员），经常不做工作，也不学习，住在文联里，吃中灶（刘苏本是大灶待遇），并且随便支使机关通讯员。
    三、于寄愚和刘知侠从来很少参加政治学习，也不参加业务学习，每天睡到“红日三竿”还不起床。同志们多不敢提意见。有一次，有一个比较负责的干部向于寄愚反映：大家对他睡懒觉不学习
    （对待整风也是如此）有意见。而于则这样回答：
    “你们全当我死了。”刘知侠领导编辑部的工作时，
    “山东文艺”发生了许多带有原则性的错误，他不问不闻，竟擅自跑到青岛去“消夏”。他明知道中共山东分局宣传部要开宣教会议，却故意避不参加。他曾是“山东文艺”的副主编，他从没有说过一句
    “如何贯彻毛主席文艺路线”的话。他竟毫不加考虑地把于寄愚写的“把地主比做猫、把雇贫农比做老鼠”的一篇有原则错误的杂文，刊在“山东文艺”的首页。
    四、于寄愚喜欢玩“金鱼”，刘知侠在一边喝彩助兴。单修鱼池、买鱼缸，就花费了公家几百万元。他指定了一个“金鱼秘书”（周中瑜），和三、四个通讯员，专门饲鱼和到街头选买各色名贵金鱼，还要轮流到大明湖捞鱼食。于寄愚和刘知侠整天不作工作，坐在池旁赏鱼。特别是于寄愚，他不管烈日和风雨，在鱼池旁一站，就是两三个钟点，机关的干部暗中反映：于副主任关心我们，还不如金鱼的百分之一。
    五、于寄愚和刘知侠最感兴趣的工作，是经营
    “大观电影院”。但这个电影院经常带头放映色情、庸俗、有毒的影片，如：“绣鞋奇案”“说谎世界”“双枪女侠”“痴男怨女”等等。他们打着
    “文联”的招牌，单纯为了牟利，毫不顾及政治影响。当大众日报把读者对该影院的批评文章转给于寄愚和刘知侠看时，他们不但不虚心检讨，反而压制民主，将批评文章压下不发。他们牺牲党的政治影响，一心要把“大观电影院”变成私人的“摇钱树”和“金库”，赚来的钱都被任意挥霍了。过去山东文联每天晚上都有打“麻将”的声音，有时楼上一桌，楼下一桌，互相赛赌。
    总之，于寄愚和刘知侠已把山东文联变成一个旧式的旅馆，和革命的文艺团体毫无相似之处。而于和刘本人，中了资产阶级的糖衣炮弹，正在日益堕落。我们要求他们两个人作公开的深刻的检讨，以便清除山东文联在群众中的坏影响。
    几个文艺学徒
    编辑同志：对山东省文联领导干部的铺张浪费、官僚主义作风，已有不少读者公开揭发。但我觉得还有加以补充的必要。山东省文联负责干部有“山头”作风和自满情绪。他们平素不研究文艺政策和文艺作品，更谈不到组织别人来研究讨论。冯毅之、丁志刚、刘知侠组成一个小圈子，对文艺工作包而不办。文艺整风与反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始很久，丁志刚、刘知侠不回文联领导运动，也不彻底检讨，却搬到大明湖畔一个幽静的地方躲风避雨，叫别人“掌握”运动，还美其名曰“离开机关进行创作”。刘知侠藉口“创作”，曾在去年秋天到青岛，以每月二百多万元的代价，在风景区租了一幢小洋楼，整天坐上小汽车，玩玩逛逛，吃吃喝喝，并且和商人称兄道弟。这样，他当然写不出什么文艺作品。他以后又搬到大明湖畔。后因避不过“风”，才和丁志刚搬回机关。文联同志发现了很多问题，提了很多意见，刘知侠始终是挤一点谈一点，还发牢骚说：“文联里没‘老虎’，你们拿我当‘老虎’对象啦。”
    于寄愚任文联副主任时，放着很多工作不管，用五十万斤小米组成一个京剧院，过了几个月，此剧院垮台散伙，白白浪费了五十万斤人民的小米。山东文联领导干部的这种严重的错误和缺点，应该从文艺界中彻底清除。　林昕　田浩
