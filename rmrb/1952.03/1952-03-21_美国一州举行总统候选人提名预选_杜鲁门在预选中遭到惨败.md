Xinhua News Agency, New York, 20th: New Hampshire held its presidential nomination elections on the 11th, with both the Democratic and Republican parties selecting candidates to compete in their respective national conventions. The presidential election will be held on November 4th this year. The national conventions for both parties to nominate presidential candidates will be held in July. In this primary in New Hampshire – the earliest in the nation – the Democratic vote showed that Truman, despite relying on the state's Democratic election machine, only received over 16,000 votes, trailing another Democratic nomination candidate, Tennessee Senator Kefauver, by over 4,000 votes.

Truman's defeat is further proof of his plummeting prestige. As a result of Truman's active pursuit of a bankrupt foreign expansion policy and the domestic arms race, his reputation at home has been declining. Even according to materials released by the American bourgeois Gallup poll, among those surveyed, support for Truman was 69% in January 1949 when Truman first took office for his current term, 31% in January 1951 after the outbreak of the Korean War, and had fallen to 23% by January of this year.

    美国一州举行总统候选人提名预选
    杜鲁门在预选中遭到惨败
    【新华社二十日讯】纽约消息：美国新罕布什尔州在十一日举行美国总统候选人的提名选举，民主和共和两党各自选出它们参加本党全国候选人竞选的人选。总统选举将在今年十一月四日举行。两党推选总统候选人的全国代表大会将在七月间举行。在新罕布什尔州的这次预选——全国各州中最早的一次——中，民主党投票结果，杜鲁门尽管依靠了该州民主党的选举机器，却只获得一万六千多票，落后于民主党另一提名候选人、田纳西州参议员克福沃达四千票之多。
    杜鲁门的这次失败乃是他威信扫地的新的证明。由于杜鲁门积极推行破产的对外扩张政策以及国内的军备运动的结果，他在国内的声望已愈来愈低落。即使根据美国资产阶级的盖洛普民意测验所公布的材料，在调查对象中，拥护杜鲁门者在一九四九年一月杜鲁门初就本届总统职位时为百分之六十九，侵朝战争爆发后一九五一年一月为百分之三十一，到今年一月已降为百分之二十三。
