More than forty state-owned factories in Northeast China have promoted the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method. These factories have not only generally improved production efficiency, but also further guaranteed product quality. For example, Mechanical Factory No. 1 used to produce ten No. 165 parts in two hours using a single tool with one cutting edge. Now, using three tools with eleven cutting edges, ten parts can be made in six minutes, increasing production efficiency by nineteen times. In a certain factory's Workshop 12, only 800 of a certain component could be made by eighteen people in one day. After applying the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method, two people can make 1,000 in one day, increasing production efficiency by more than ten times. Workshop 3 of Mechanical Factory No. 3 used the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method on more than 80 types of lathe parts, increasing output by an average of more than two times. Tao Dianchen, a lathe worker at the Dacheng Coal Mine in Xi'an, improved product quality from 80 percent to 100 percent after using the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method. Liu Xinghan, a lathe worker at the Nanfen Mineral Processing Plant in Benxi, increased output by six times after learning the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method, and the machine parts he made were fully qualified.

Because the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method simplifies the production process, young workers can quickly master this advanced method. For example, Teng Fujiu, an apprentice in the repair workshop of Yingkou Textile Factory, with the help of technician Gao Yushan, modified four multi-edge tools in half a day, increasing production efficiency by three times, and improving quality from 80 percent to 100 percent.

The method used by each factory and workshop to promote the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method is to first explain to the workers the great significance of promoting this cutting method, and at the same time, organize visits and practical demonstrations to dispel the conservative ideas of some workers; then, a research group is organized by workers with more production experience to first conduct research on the use of the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method on one or two types of parts, and then further promote it to various parts; or technical personnel and workshop directors first go deep into several groups with emphasis to help research, and then promote it universally.

In the process of promotion, each factory and workshop also initially solved the difficulties of sharpening and installing tools, creating extremely important favorable conditions for the wider promotion of this advanced experience in the future. For example, after Mechanical Factory No. 7, Workshop 3 promoted the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method, the demand for tools increased, and sharpening still had to be done by experienced technicians, but each section of thirty or forty people only had one grinding wheel for sharpening tools. Therefore, many workers were queuing up to sharpen tools every day, often taking one or two hours to sharpen a tool, which greatly affected production. Therefore, the leadership of this workshop extracted two technicians with sharpening experience to establish a tool room, and pre-sharpened many kinds of tools. Anyone whose tool is dull can go to the tool room to exchange it without delaying production at all. After the universal promotion of the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method in the lathe workshop of the sprayer department of Northeast Agricultural Implement Factory No. 1, a new problem arose, that is, the old tool holder was too small to install more tools on one side, and because the screws for clamping the tools were too small, the clamped tools would easily vibrate during cutting. Yu Wenbin, the director of the tool workshop, studied with the workers and created a tool holder specially suitable for the implementation of the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method. This tool holder can adjust the number, height, and tightness of the tools at will according to production needs. In this way, the difficulty for workers to install multiple tools was solved.

    东北四十多个工厂推广多刀多刃切削法
    生产效率提高多倍产品质量更有保证
    在推广过程中初步解决了磨刀和安刀的困难
    多刀多刃切削法已在东北四十多个公营工厂中推广。这些工厂不但生产效率普遍提高，而且产品质量也更有了保证。如机械一厂生产一六五号部件，从前用一把刀一个刃作，两点钟才做出十个，现在用三把刀十一个刃作，六分钟就做十个，生产效率提高了十九倍。某工厂十二车间的某种部件，过去十八个人一天只能做出八百个，自运用多刀多刃切削法后，两个人一天就能做出一千个，生产效率提高十倍以上。机械三厂第三车间在八十多种车工部件上使用多刀多刃切削法，产量平均提高了两倍多。西安大成煤矿车床工人陶殿臣，运用多刀多刃切削法后，产品质量由百分之八十提高到百分之百。本溪南芬选矿机电场车床工人刘兴汉，学习多刀多刃切削法后，产量提高六倍，做出的机器零件完全合格。
    由于多刀多刃切削法简化了生产工序，因而青年工人都能很快地掌握这一先进方法。如营口纺织厂修理车间徒工滕富久，在技术工人高玉山的帮助下，半天工夫就改好了四把多刃刀，使生产效率提高了三倍，质量也由百分之八十提高到百分之百。
    各工厂、车间推广多刀多刃切削法的办法是先给工人讲解推广这一切削法的重大意义，同时并组织参观和实际表演，以打消一部分工人的保守思想；然后由比较有生产经验的工人组织一个研究小组，先在一两种部件上进行使用多刀多刃切削法的研究，再进一步推广到各种部件上去；或者先由技术人员、车间主任有重点地深入几个小组，帮助研究，然后再普遍推广。
    各工厂、车间在推广过程中，还初步解决了磨刀和安刀的困难，为今后更广泛地推广这一先进经验创造了极重要的有利条件。如机械七厂第三车间在推广多刀多刃切削法后，需要的刀多了，而磨刀还得比较有经验的技术工人去磨，但每一工段三、四十人仅设有一个磨刀的沙轮，因此每天就有许多工人排着队等着磨刀，往往磨一把刀要耗费一、两个钟头，大大影响了生产。因此，这个车间领导方面就抽出了两个有磨刀经验的技术工人成立了一个刀具室，事先磨好许多各式各样的刀。谁的刀钝了，就去刀具室换，一点也不耽误生产。东北农具一厂喷雾器部车工车间，在普遍推广多刀多刃切削法后，发生了一个新问题，就是旧的刀架子太小，不能在一面安更多的刀，同时因为卡刀的螺丝太小，卡的刀多了切削时容易颤动。工具车间主任于文斌就和工人们研究，创造了一种专门适合实行多刀多刃切削法的刀架子。这种刀架子，可以根据生产的需要，随便调整刀的多少，刀具的高低和松紧。这样，就解决了工人们安装多刀的困难。
