Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: Paris Dispatch: The French Faure government, which had only been in power for forty days, collapsed on February 29th. This is a direct result of the French people's powerful struggle demanding peace and opposing war, and also the first significant consequence of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc's recent expansion of armaments and war preparation conference in Lisbon.

The Faure government was forced to resign after its policy of again massively increasing taxes to fund war and war preparations failed to gain the support of the French National Assembly. In France, the financial and economic situation has deteriorated extremely due to the rulers' years of spending large amounts of wealth on the colonial war in Indochina and implementing the arms expansion and war preparation policies directed by the United States. The recent rapid depletion of dollar reserves and the sharp decline in the franc's credit clearly demonstrate this. However, instead of complying with the will of the French people and quickly ceasing the war and war preparation policies that are leading the country to destruction, the Faure government continued its predecessors' policy of following the United States, forcing the parliament to pass the plan for the so-called "European Army," and accepting new war preparation tasks assigned to France at the North Atlantic aggressive bloc's Lisbon conference. Only five hours after flying back to Paris from Lisbon, Faure convened an emergency cabinet meeting and decided, in accordance with US orders, to add to the 1952 military budget, bringing the total to 1.4 trillion francs, almost double the budget proposed in 1951. To cope with this huge expenditure, the Faure government asked the parliament to pass a financial bill increasing taxes by 15 percent and exerted strong pressure on the parliament to vote for a vote of confidence in the government. At the same time, "Le Figaro," reflecting American opinions, clearly demanded that the French National Assembly support the Faure government. However, the French government's policy of enslavement, agreeing to the US rearming West Germany and placing French troops under American control, has aroused fierce opposition from the French people. At the same time, the French people firmly protested against the Faure government's acceptance of the war preparation tasks stipulated by the United States. This powerful opposition from the French people has made many members of the right-wing parties dare not openly support the Faure government's demands. Under these circumstances, the Faure government's tax increase bill requesting a vote of confidence from the parliament was rejected by 283 votes in favor to 309 votes against. In this vote, even some members of Faure's own Radical Socialist Party and the so-called Independent Republican Peasant Union, which participated in the government, voted against it along with the Communists.

The sudden demise of the Faure government has made the US ruling group very anxious and uneasy. They fear that the US's war preparation plan in Europe will suffer a serious blow. On the day the Faure government collapsed, a dispatch from Paris by the Associated Press revealed this worried mood, saying that the collapse of the Faure government "threatens to overturn the achievements of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council's Lisbon conference. The collapse of the Faure government has at least temporarily overturned the main foundation of the United States' hopes – the United States originally hoped to take practical steps immediately to achieve military and economic unity in Western Europe." According to another dispatch from Washington by the same agency, US Republican Congressman Smith admitted that this matter "shows that the French people are unwilling to bear the 'heavy burden of defense'." Smith also said distressingly: The "possible achievements" of the Lisbon conference may prove to be just "some kind of fantasy."

    法国人民反对增税备战政策
    富尔政府被迫垮台
    美国统治集团严重焦虑不安
    【新华社三日讯】巴黎消息：上台才四十天的法国富尔政府，已在二月二十九日垮台，这是法国人民展开的要求和平、反对战争的强有力斗争的直接结果，也是北大西洋侵略集团新近在里斯本举行的扩军备战会议第一个显著的后果。
    富尔政府是在要求法国国民议会支持政府再次大量增税以充战争和备战费用的政策失败后，被迫辞职的。在法国，由于统治者历年把大量资财耗费在印度支那殖民战争和执行美国所指使的扩军备战政策上面，财政经济情况极端恶化。最近美元储备的迅速枯竭和法郎信用的暴跌，就清楚地表明了这一点。可是，富尔政府不遵照法国人民的意志，赶紧停止执行把国家引向毁灭的战争和备战政策，而继续其前政府追随美国的政策，强迫议会通过关于所谓“欧洲军”的计划，并且在北大西洋侵略集团里斯本会议上接受了加给法国的新的备战任务。富尔从里斯本飞回巴黎仅仅五个钟头后，就召集内阁紧急会议，决定遵照美国命令，追加一九五二年度军费预算，使总数高达一万四千亿法郎，较一九五一年度提出的预算几乎增加一倍。为了应付这一巨大支出，富尔政府要求议会通过一个增税百分之十五的财政法案，并且对议会施行强大压力，要求议会投信任政府票。同时，反映美国意见的“费加罗报”还明白地要求法国国民议会支持富尔政府。可是，法国政府同意美国重新武装西德并把法国军队也置于美国控制之下的奴化政策，已激起法国人民的猛烈反对。法国人民同时坚决抗议富尔政府接受美国所规定的扩军备战任务。法国人民这种强有力的反对。使得右翼政党的许多议员都不敢公开支持富尔政府的要求。在这种情况下，富尔政府要求议会投信任票的增税案，便以二百八十三票赞成对三百零九票反对遭到否决。在这一次表决中，甚至富尔自己的激进社会党和参加政府的所谓独立共和农民联盟的若干议员，都和共产党人一道投了反对票。
    富尔政府的突然夭折，使得美国统治集团非常焦虑不安。他们害怕美国在欧洲的备战计划将受到严重的打击。在富尔政府垮台的当天，合众社从巴黎发出的电讯就流露这种忧虑心情说，富尔政府的垮台，“大有推翻北大西洋公约理事会里斯本会议的成就之势。富尔政府垮台一事，至少是暂时推翻了美国方面希望的主要基础——美国原来希望立即采取实际步骤，来达到西欧军事和经济上的统一。”据该社发自华盛顿的另一则电讯说，美国共和党众议员司密斯承认这件事情“表示法国人民不愿意承担‘防务的重担’”。司密斯还苦恼地说：里斯本会议“可能的成就”，可能证明只是“某种幻想”。
