Acheson's lies cannot conceal the ironclad facts. The American aggressors, disregarding international conventions and human morality, frantically spread bacteria in Korea and Northeast China,妄想attempting to rely on this cruel and barbaric means to salvage its shameful defeat and continue and expand the war of aggression. This heinous crime of the American aggressors has aroused great anger and severe condemnation from peace-loving people all over the world. Under the just condemnation of the people of the world, the American war criminals panicked. Acheson, the US Secretary of State, who originally did not dare to come out and defend himself, had to shamelessly quibble on March 4, saying that the US military "has not conducted and is not now conducting any germ warfare." Ridgway, the commander-in-chief of the US invading forces in Korea, then openly lied and said: "There is no truth in the Communist side's words. The Communist side's statements about germ warfare are completely, absolutely, and unequivocally fabricated."

However, facts and truth cannot be concealed by the lies of murderers like Acheson and Ridgway. Not only have the irrefutable facts revealed to the world by the Korean and Chinese people proved the crimes of the American aggressors in conducting germ warfare, but also, according to the statements of responsible officials of the American military and government and the materials revealed by reactionary newspapers and magazines, it is fully proven that the American aggressors' conduct of germ warfare was a long-term plan and preparation. These facts prove that Acheson and Ridgway are not only the most insidious and vicious executioners, but also the most despicable and shameless liars.

The United States' preparation for germ warfare began as early as ten years ago. In January 1946, Merle, chairman of the US Army Biological Warfare Committee, revealed in a "Report to the Secretary of the Army on Germ Warfare" that the United States already had an organization called the "Military Research Office" during World War II, which began to study the work of complete bacterial weapons. According to the report, after 1943, the research on germ warfare accelerated, and the "Military Research Office" was taken over by the Chemical Warfare Service of the US Department of the Army. The main work center was established at Camp Detrick near Frederick, Maryland, under the secret name of "Special Projects Branch." The American military authorities established a large laboratory and the first batch of factories there. During World War II, approximately 3,900 people worked there. In addition, field test stations were established in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and Dugway, Utah, and a large-scale factory for manufacturing bacterial weapons was established in Vigo, Indiana. In addition, the US Navy also conducted germ warfare experiments at the University of California. It is said that the total cost of the US germ warfare plan was approximately 50 million US dollars. The report also shamelessly stated that germ warfare is "the cheapest" way to carry out mass slaughter. Merle wrote: "I must point out that without spending a lot of money and without establishing huge manufacturing facilities... it is possible to develop germ warfare agents." Merle's report shamelessly listed the main aspects of research, including "developing methods and equipment for large-scale manufacturing of microorganisms and their products; testing methods to increase the toxicity of such microorganisms; conducting field tests, including experiments using animals to spread bacteria or bacterial products. ..." Merle's report was hastily withdrawn because it revealed too much.

By 1946, important figures in the American military and political circles had already expressed their eagerness to use bacterial weapons to attack the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and to carry out large-scale slaughter of mankind. In June 1946, the American "Collier's" magazine quoted White, director of the Chemical Warfare Service of the US Army, as saying about bacterial weapons: "I believe that germ warfare is a very effective and practical form of warfare." Regarding the fact that germ warfare is a crime that violates the most basic moral standards of mankind, this professional executioner said shamelessly: "I completely disagree with the question of whether a weapon is humane."

In the same month, "Time" magazine reported that bragging about new weapons could be heard in the US Congress. Congressman Thomas bragged that the United States already had a powerful weapon and said: "We have this thing today—not tomorrow—and it is already available for use."

In December 1947, the "New York Herald Tribune" quoted a report from the government's special bureau led by Major General Harold Bull as saying: Secret technologies for spreading radioactive poisons through the air, and using bacteria against humans, animals, and plants, are all included in the research work carried out by the Army, Navy, Air Force, and other agencies. The newspaper said: Although the activities of Camp Detrick, the germ warfare research center, are covered in secrecy for safety reasons, non-military scientists pointed out that the military is greatly interested in certain bacterial and toxin data, especially those that can be spread by aircraft or shells that explode at a certain height, such as anthrax, relapsing fever, and yellow fever bacteria. They also mentioned the bubonic plague, considering it an excellent bacterial weapon.

On March 12, 1949, Forrestal, who had served as the US Secretary of Defense, issued a statement saying: "Our research shows that bacteria or their toxic products can be effectively used as weapons of war." The next day, the "New York Times" published an interview with General White. White reiterated his belief that germ warfare was practical and feasible. He also said: "I think we have the best scientists in the world working on this issue. At the end of World War II, we were far ahead of any of our enemies."

Theodore Rosebury, a professor at Columbia University who participated in the manufacture of bacterial weapons at Camp Detrick, wrote a book entitled "Peace or Pestilence" in 1949. This book also confirmed that Camp Detrick was the center for biological warfare research. Rosebury, who actually represented the views of American war profiteers, inhumanely and openly praised bacterial weapons. He wrote on page 175 of the book: "Even in wartime, the opinion that biological weapons are extremely filthy and ugly prevails. I think this is an excited and irrational view of the problem. What is the difference between a person dying easily or dying painfully? He will die anyway, and in the end, he is just a corpse." He wrote on page 61 of the book: "It can be used to eliminate people or deprive them of their ability to work without destroying their property." This fully exposes the brutal and greedy ambitions of the American imperialist bandits. In the summer of 1949, Canadian newspapers revealed that the United States was testing bacterial weapons on Eskimos, resulting in a plague outbreak there.

On July 24, 1949, American newspapers published an Associated Press report, which exposed that the American aggressors were then making every effort to expand the scale of manufacturing bacterial weapons. The Associated Press stated that the news was based on a special report from the US Department of the Army. The news said: The US Department of the Army requested more than 3 million US dollars from the House of Representatives to increase the equipment of Camp Detrick. This money will be used to improve bacterial weapons. This weapon is intended to be used against people and against the sources of people's food—animals and plants. The research is aimed at using bacterial weapons in any part of the world.

On March 31, 1950, three months before the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, then-US Secretary of Defense Johnson said: There has been "complete" and "detailed" research on many media that spread diseases to people, livestock, and grains. The US Army Staff School's publication "Military Review" at Fort Leavenworth published a comprehensive article in its April 1950 issue discussing how to conduct germ warfare.

As soon as the Korean War began, Korea was considered by the American aggressors as the first place to test this new American weapon. On July 8, 1950, a few days after the US government sent troops to attack the Korean people, the American "Scientific Communications" magazine published an apparently instructed article entitled "Germ Warfare in Korea?" This article studied the possibility and probability of using bacterial weapons in Korea.

In the winter of 1950 to the spring of 1951, the American aggressors launched the first germ warfare against the Korean people, resulting in a smallpox epidemic in northern Korea at that time. At this time, a person named Pincher wrote an article in the British "Discovery" magazine in December 1950. The author said: "From the latest information I have obtained, it can be seen that a practical and long-term germ warfare weapon that can be used when needed has been designed in the United States." According to the author, this is the bacterial bomb manufactured by the American aggressors; moreover, this bomb has been subjected to "field tests" in Utah, USA.

In March 1951, the US military's bacterial landing craft No. 1091 secretly sailed to Wonsan Port in Korea. According to the American "Newsweek" magazine published on April 9, the landing craft "was equipped with a laboratory, complete with rats and rabbits." The US Marine Corps "brought Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war to the ship to test whether they already had signs of the terrible bubonic plague." At the same time, according to the Associated Press, Brigadier General Symes, director of the "Health and Welfare Department" of the US invading forces in Korea, secretly sneaked into the rear of Korea on the night of March 13 to collect "information on the occurrence of plague" and carry out criminal activities. After this, the aforementioned landing craft sailed to Geoje Island southwest of Busan to conduct bacterial experiments on prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army imprisoned on the island. According to the Associated Press, the ship's "laboratory obtains bacterial cultures from the mouths and intestines of patients in the POW camp on Geoje Island, conducting 3,000 tests every day."

At the end of 1951, according to a Telecommunications Agency report on December 5, American officials revealed that Japanese germ warfare criminals Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano, carrying all the necessary equipment for conducting germ warfare, arrived in Korea on a cargo ship. They will use prisoners of war from the Korean and Chinese People's Armies as experimental subjects and formulate plans for using bacterial weapons in winter. The American aggressors' steps to prepare for germ warfare in Korea were intensifying step by step.

On January 22 of this year, Brigadier General Rucks, Assistant Director of the US Army Chemical Corps, openly spoke in Baltimore, USA, about the expansion plan of the US military to use chemical and bacterial weapons to carry out mass slaughter of mankind. Three days later, Brigadier General Clissey, Director of Research and Development of the Army Chemical Corps, publicly promoted the use of poison gas and bacterial weapons. At this time, the American murderers in Korea took action. Since January 28, they have dropped a large number of poisonous insects carrying bacteria on the peaceful people of Korea. At the end of February, the American aggressors extended their criminal atrocities to Northeast China. They directly used bacterial weapons to slaughter our people.

Of course, it should not be forgotten that the bacterial weapons used by the American aggressors against the Korean and Chinese people were researched and manufactured with the participation of Japanese germ warfare criminals and Hitler's bacteriological experts. Their criminal experience was fully inherited by the American aggressors. Many Japanese and German bacterial experts work in laboratories and research institutes led by the US Department of the Army. In Japan and West Germany, institutions researching bacterial weapons are carrying out their criminal activities intensively.

People can see from the above facts how the greedy American imperialism, in order to vainly attempt to dominate the world and enslave all mankind, has painstakingly researched and developed the most barbaric bacterial weapons in order to massively slaughter the peace-loving and freedom-loving people of the world. Therefore, just as Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression, pointed out in his telegram to Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, on February 25: "The American aggressors' monstrous crimes in Korea are not only the massacre of peaceful residents in Korea and the Chinese and Korean People's Armed Forces, but also a major threat to world peace and the safety of all mankind." For the sake of human civilization and progress, and for the life and happiness of the next generation, all upright and kind people in the world must rise up to stop the serious crimes of the American aggressors and give severe and just sanctions to the criminals who launched germ warfare.

    艾奇逊的谎言掩盖不住铁的事实
    美国侵略者处心积虑准备细菌战的铁证
    美国侵略者不顾国际公约和人类道德，在朝鲜和我国东北疯狂撒布细菌，妄想依靠这种残忍野蛮的手段来挽救它可耻的失败，继续并扩大侵略战争。美国侵略者的这一滔天罪行，引起了全世界爱好和平的人民的极大的愤怒和严厉的谴责。在全世界人民的正义声讨下，美国战犯们着了慌。原来不敢出来声辩的美国国务卿艾奇逊，不得不厚颜无耻地在三月四日狡赖说，美军“过去未进行，现在也未进行任何细菌战”。侵朝美军总司令李奇微接着也公开撒谎说：“共方的话没有真实之处。共方关于细菌战的声明完全、绝对、明明白白是虚构之言。”
    可是，事实和真理终究不是艾奇逊、李奇微之流的杀人凶犯的谎言所能掩盖得了的。不但朝中人民已经向全世界揭发出来的无可辩驳的事实证明了美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行，就是根据美国军政方面负责官员的言论和反动报纸杂志透露出来的材料，也完全证明了美国侵略者进行细菌战是处心积虑地经过了长期的计划和准备的。这些事实证明了艾奇逊和李奇微之流不仅是最阴险恶毒的刽子手，而且是最卑鄙无耻的撒谎者。
    美国准备细菌战早在十年以前就开始了。在一九四六年一月，美国陆军生物战争委员会主席墨尔克在“关于细菌战争给陆军部长的报告”中曾透露：美国在第二次世界大战中就已有一个以“军事研究处”为名的机构，开始研究完备的细菌武器的工作。据该报告透露：一九四三年以后，细菌战的研究加速了，“军事研究处”由美国陆军部化学战争处接办。该处在美国马里兰州佛烈德利克地方附近的狄特里克营设立了主要的工作中心，秘密名称是“特别计划科”。美国军事当局在该处建立了大实验室和头一批工厂。第二次世界大战中，约有三千九百人在那里工作。除此之外，在密士失必州的巴斯卡高拉和犹他州的得格威设立了野外试验站，在印第安纳州的维哥建立了大规模制造细菌武器的大工厂。此外，美国海军也在加利福尼亚大学进行细菌战争实验。据说：美国细菌战计划的全部费用约五千万美元。这篇报告还无耻地说：细菌战是“最便宜的”进行大规模屠杀的方式。墨尔克写道：“我必须指出，不用费很多的钱，不用建立巨大的制造设备……就可以发展细菌战争的媒介物。”墨尔克的报告十分无耻地列举了研究的主要方面，其中有“发展大规模制造微生物及其生成物的方法和设备；试验增加这种微生物的毒性的方法；进行野外试验，包括使用动物散布细菌或细菌生成物的试验。……”墨尔克的报告匆匆地被收回去了，原因是它透露的事情太多了。
    到了一九四六年，美国军方和政界的重要人物已经表示他们急于想用细菌武器来进攻苏联和人民民主国家，来大规模地屠杀人类。一九四六年六月，美国“柯里尔”杂志援引了美国陆军化学战争处处长韦特谈到细菌武器时的话说：“我相信细菌战争是一种效力很大的实际的战争形式。”对于细菌战是违反人类最起码的道德标准的罪行这一点，这个职业刽子手恬不知耻地说：“我完全不同意谈一种武器是否合乎人道的问题。”
    同月，美国“时代”杂志报道：在美国国会中可以听到关于新武器的吹嘘。众议员托马斯吹牛说，美国已经有了一种厉害的武器，并且说：“我们今天就有这种东西——不是明天——并且已经可以使用了。”
    一九四七年十二月，“纽约先驱论坛报”引哈罗尔特·布尔少将领导的政府特别局的报告说：经过空气散布放射性的毒物，以及使用细菌对付人、动物和植物的秘密技术，这一切都列在陆海空军和其他机构所进行的研究工作之内。该报说：虽然细菌战研究中心狄特里克营的活动，为了安全起见盖着密幕，但是非军事的科学家指出：军界对于一定的细菌和毒素资料，有巨大兴趣，尤其是那些能够用飞机或者在一定高度爆炸的炮弹来散布的病菌，如炭疽热、回归热和黄热病菌。他们也提到黑死病，认为它是出色的细菌武器。
    一九四九年三月十二日，曾任美国国防部长的福莱斯特尔发表声明说：“我们的研究说明，细菌或者它们的有毒的生成物可以有效地用作战争武器。”第二天，“纽约时报”发表了韦特将军访问记。韦特重申他相信细菌战争是实际可行的。他并说：“我认为，我们有世界上最好的科学家在研究这个问题。在第二次世界大战结束时，我们远远超过了我们的任何敌人。”
    曾在狄特里克营参加制造细菌武器的美国哥伦比亚大学教授提奥多尔·罗兹伯里，在一九四九年写了一本名为“和平或是瘟疫”的书。这本书也证实了狄特里克营是研究生物战的中心。实际上是代表美国战争贩子的看法的罗兹伯里，无人性地公开颂扬细菌武器。他在该书第一百七十五页上写道：“甚至在战时，把生物武器看作极肮脏丑恶的意见都占上风。我认为这是对问题的激动而不理智的见解。人轻松地死或痛苦地死，有什么区别呢？他同样都要死，到头不过是尸体”。他在该书第六十一页上写道：“它可以用来消灭人或剥夺他们的劳动能力，而不破坏他们的财产”。这充分暴露出了美帝国主义强盗残暴贪婪的野心。一九四九年夏天，加拿大报纸透露，美国在爱斯基摩试验细菌武器，结果那里鼠疫盛行。
    一九四九年七月二十四日，美国各报登载了一条美联社的消息，这消息暴露了美国侵略者当时正在尽力扩大制造细菌武器的规模。美联社声明说：这条消息是根据美国陆军部的专门报告的。消息说：美国陆军部向众院要求拨三百多万美元来增加狄特里克营的设备。这笔款将用来改进细菌武器。这武器是预定用来对付人和对付人们食物的来源——动植物的。研究是以在世界任何部分使用细菌武器为目的。
    一九五○年三月三十一日，即美国发动侵朝战争前三个月，当时的美国国防部长詹逊曾说：关于对人、家畜、谷物传染疫病的许多媒介，已经有了“完全的”和“详尽的”研究。利汶渥斯堡的美国陆军参谋学校的校刊“军事评论”在一九五○年四月号上登载了一篇综合性的文章，讨论如何进行细菌战。
    朝鲜战争一开始，朝鲜就被美国侵略者考虑作为第一个试验这种新的美国武器的地方。一九五○年七月八日是美国政府派遣军队攻击朝鲜人民之后的几天，美国的“科学通讯”杂志登出了一篇显然经过授意的文章，题目是“在朝鲜进行细菌战吗？”这篇文章研究了在朝鲜使用细菌武器的可能性和或然性。
    在一九五○年冬到一九五一年春，美国侵略者对朝鲜人民发动了第一次细菌战，以致当时朝鲜北部天花流行。这时，有一个叫做宾乔的人在英国的“发现”杂志一九五○年十二月号上写了一篇文章。作者说：“从我所得到的最近的材料就可以看出：在需要时就可以使用的一种实用的长期的细菌战武器，已在美国设计出来了。”据作者透露，这就是美国侵略者制造出来的细菌炸弹；而且，这种炸弹已经在美国犹他州进行过“野外试验”。
    一九五一年三月间，美军一零九一号细菌登陆艇秘密开到朝鲜元山港。据四月九日出版的美国“新闻周刊”透露：该登陆艇“上设实验室，老鼠兔子俱全”。美国海军陆战队将中国人民志愿军被俘人员“带到船上，试验他们是否已有可怖的黑死病的征候。”同时，据美联社透露：侵朝美军司令部“卫生福利处”处长赛姆斯准将，曾于三月十三日夜秘密潜入朝鲜后方，搜集“发生瘟疫的情报”，进行罪恶活动。在此之后，前述登陆艇即开往釜山西南的巨济岛，对囚禁在该岛的朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行细菌试验。据美联社透露：船上的“实验室自伸展在巨济岛上的战俘营的病人那里取得口与肠的病菌培养物，每天进行三千次试验。”
    一九五一年底，据电通社十二月五日报道：美国官员透露，日本细菌战犯石井四郎、若松次郎和北野政藏等三人，携带了进行细菌战的一切必要装备，乘货船到达朝鲜。他们将以朝中人民军队被俘人员作为实验对象，并拟出在冬季使用细菌武器的计划。美国侵略者准备在朝鲜进行细菌战的步骤，是一步比一步加紧了。
    到今年一月二十二日，美国陆军化学兵团助理主任罗克斯准将在美国巴尔的摩公然谈到美国军方利用大规模屠杀人类的化学与细菌武器的扩大计划。三天以后，陆军化学兵团研究与发展处处长克利西准将公开宣传毒气与细菌武器的使用。就在这个时候，在朝鲜的美国杀人犯采取了行动。自一月二十八日起，他们向朝鲜和平人民投下了大量带有细菌的毒虫。二月底，美国侵略者又把它们的罪恶暴行扩展到我国东北。它们直接使用细菌武器来屠杀我国人民了。
    当然，不应该忘记：美国侵略者对朝中人民使用的细菌武器，有着日本的细菌战犯、希特勒的细菌学专家的参与研究与制造。他们的罪恶经验被美国侵略者全部继承下来。许多日本和德国的细菌专家在美国陆军部领导的实验室和研究所中工作。在日本和西德，研究细菌武器的机构，紧张地进行着它们的罪恶活动。
    人们从以上事实可以看到：贪婪的美帝国主义为了妄想制霸世界，奴役全人类，是怎样处心积虑地研究和发展最野蛮的细菌武器，以便大规模地屠杀全世界爱好和平和自由的人民。因此，正像中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若在二月二十五日给世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里的电报中所指出的：“美国侵略者在朝鲜的滔天罪行已不单是对朝鲜和平居民和中朝人民武装力量的虐杀，它并且是对全世界和平与全人类安全的重大威胁。”为了人类的文明与进步，为了下一代的生命与幸福，全世界一切正直善良的人必须起来制止美国侵略者的严重罪行，给发动细菌战的罪犯以严厉的正义的制裁。（新华社）
