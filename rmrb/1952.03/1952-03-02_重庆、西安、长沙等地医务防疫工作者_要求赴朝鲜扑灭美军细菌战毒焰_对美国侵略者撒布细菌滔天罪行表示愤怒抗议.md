Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 1st—More than 240 epidemic prevention workers in Chongqing have signed up to volunteer to go to Korea to extinguish the bacteria spread by the American aggressors. They are members of the Epidemic Prevention Team of the Southwest Military and Political Committee's Health Department and the Epidemic Prevention Team of the Chongqing Municipal Health Bureau. They jointly wrote to the newspaper saying: "We are experts in eradicating bacteria and warriors in defeating bacteria. In order to assist the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland and Korean friends, and also to give the American aggressors a strong counterattack, we demand to go to Korea to carry out the work of defending against germ warfare."

More than 40 bacteriology experts and medical science workers in Chongqing held a forum to discuss organizing forces to step up the production of medicines and vaccines needed for epidemic prevention, and to establish specialized institutions for studying the defense against germ warfare. They expressed their readiness to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and organize epidemic prevention teams to go to Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st—Medical personnel and medical workers in Xi'an and Changsha angrily protested against the heinous crime of the American aggressors spreading bacteria in Korea and signed up to go to Korea to extinguish the poisonous flames of the American aggressors' germ warfare.

Liu Junying, a model medical worker in Xi'an, said: "Medical workers in Shaanxi Province are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time to go to Korea to extinguish bacteria and give a powerful counterattack to the American aggressors' germ warfare." All but four students of the Shaanxi Provincial Midwifery School, who were absent due to illness, signed up to request to go to Korea to work. The Northwest Medical College held a forum on the 27th to denounce the atrocities of the US military and received more than 230 letters of determination to serve in Korea on the spot.

Medical and medical workers in Changsha held a forum on the 28th. Deng Yiwei, Dean of Xiangya Hospital, who personally participated in the investigation of the Japanese invaders spreading plague bacteria in Changde in November 1941, sadly said: "At that time, Changde City had become a terrifying city of death. In Hujia Courtyard and Miaohou Street in the city, many families had no smoke, many people died in bed without burial, and some families were wiped out. The Chinese people will never forget this blood debt.” Mei Chaozhang, an environmental sanitation worker who participated in the eradication of the Changde plague at that time, said: "We collected more than two loads of grains, wheat, and soybeans with plague bacteria dropped by Japanese planes in the Changde urban area. After our tests, these things all contained plague bacillus." Everyone unanimously believed that the US imperialists' atrocities of using the Chinese people's deadly enemy—Japanese germ warfare criminals—to kill the Chinese and Korean People's Army and the Korean people are intolerable. Representatives at the meeting expressed their views: Raise vigilance, strengthen epidemic prevention propaganda and education work; and be prepared to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and go to Korea to extinguish the poisonous flames of the American aggressors' germ warfare.

    对美国侵略者撒布细菌滔天罪行表示愤怒抗议
    【新华社重庆一日电】重庆市二百四十多个防疫工作者报名志愿赴朝鲜扑灭美国侵略者所撒布的细菌。他们是西南军政委员会卫生部防疫队和重庆市卫生局防疫队的队员。他们联名投书给报社说：“我们是扑灭细菌的能手，战胜细菌的战士，为援助祖国英雄子弟和朝鲜友人，也为了给予美国侵略者有力的回击，我们要求赴朝鲜进行防御细菌战的工作。”
    重庆市细菌学专家及医药科学工作者四十多人举行了座谈会，讨论组织力量，加紧生产防疫需要的药品和疫苗，成立专门研究防御细菌战的机构等问题。他们表示准备随时响应祖国号召，组织防疫队到朝鲜去。
    【新华社一日讯】西安、长沙两地医学界人士和医务工作者愤怒抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜撒布细菌的滔天罪行，并纷纷报名赴朝鲜扑灭美国侵略者细菌战的毒焰。
    西安市模范医务工作者刘俊英说：“陕西省医务工作者，准备随时响应祖国的号召，到朝鲜去扑灭细菌，给美国侵略者的细菌战以有力的回击。”陕西省助产学校的学员除四名因病未出席外，其余的都签名要求赴朝鲜工作。西北医学院在二十七日举行控诉美军暴行座谈会，当场收到二百三十多份要求赴朝服务的决心书。
    长沙市医学界和医务工作者在二十八日举行了座谈会。一九四一年十一月间曾亲身参加调查日寇在常德散布鼠疫细菌事件的湘雅医院院长邓一韪悲愤地说：“当时常德城已成了一个死亡的恐怖城，城里胡家院子、庙后街一带，很多人家都绝了烟火，很多人死在床上没有掩埋，有的一家人都死光了。中国人民谁都不会忘记这笔血海深仇。”当时参加扑灭常德鼠疫的环境卫生工作者梅朝章说：“我们在常德市区收捡了日机投下的附有鼠疫细菌的媒介物，单是谷、麦、豆粒就有两担多。经我们化验，这些东西里都含有鼠疫杆菌。”大家一致认为：美帝国主义者利用中国人民的死敌——日本细菌战犯来杀害中朝人民军队和朝鲜人民的暴行，是不能容忍的。到会代表纷纷表示：提高警惕，加强防疫宣传教育工作；并准备随时响应祖国号召，到朝鲜去扑灭美国侵略者细菌战的毒焰。
