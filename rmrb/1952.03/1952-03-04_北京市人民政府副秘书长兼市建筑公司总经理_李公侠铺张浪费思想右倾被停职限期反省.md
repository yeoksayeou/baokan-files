Li Gongxia Suspended from Duty and Ordered to Conduct Self-Criticism for Extravagance and Right-Leaning Ideology

[This newspaper reports] Li Gongxia, Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal People's Government and General Manager of the Beijing Municipal Construction Company, exhibited serious extravagance and bureaucratic tendencies in his life and work. The enterprises under his leadership suffered from serious waste, and policy violations occurred.

During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Li Gongxia made some self-criticism, but it was not deep enough. Because he still harbors serious right-leaning complacency, he failed to effectively promote the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the units under his company. He adopted a lenient or even protective attitude towards some cadres with unclean hands, who suppressed democracy, resisted the movement, and were suspected of corruption, which greatly affected the normal development of the movement.

Shortly after the start of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the municipal leading organs appointed Zhang Youyu, Xue Zizheng, Cheng Hongyi, Gu Dachuan, and Fan Rusheng to form a special committee on January 13th. This committee dispatched a group of cadres to work with the economy inspection committees of the various units under the company to conduct inspections. A large number of corrupt elements and bourgeois spies have now been uncovered. Based on the preliminary inspection results, the Municipal People's Government decided on February 29th to suspend Li Gongxia from all his duties and order him to conduct self-criticism within a limited time. The final disposition will be made based on his self-criticism and the results of continued inspections.

    李公侠铺张浪费思想右倾被停职限期反省
    【本报讯】北京市人民政府副秘书长兼北京市建筑公司总经理李公侠，在生活上、工作上，存在着严重的铺张浪费和官僚主义作风；他所领导的各企业，存在着严重的浪费现象并曾发生违反政策的错误。
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，李公侠虽然做过一些检讨，但很不深刻。由于他还存在着严重的右倾麻痹思想，对公司所属各单位的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动便推动不力，并对一些手面不干净、压制民主、抵抗运动的干部和贪污嫌疑分子，采取纵容甚至包庇的态度，因而大大影响了运动的正常开展。
    市的领导机关，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后不久，即在一月十三日，指派张友渔、薛子正、程宏毅、顾大川、范儒生等五人组织专门委员会，并由这个委员会派出一批干部会同公司所属各单位的节约检查委员会负责进行检查。现已查出了大批贪污分子和资产阶级的坐探。现在，市人民政府根据初步检查的结果，在二月二十九日决定停止李公侠的一切职务，限期反省。然后根据他反省的情况和继续检查的结果，再作最后处理。
