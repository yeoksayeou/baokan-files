Xinhua News Agency, 7th: Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, cabled the Women's International Democratic Federation, requesting a call to action for women worldwide to immediately mobilize and launch a global movement against germ warfare, to stop the crimes of American aggressors conducting germ warfare in Korea and China. The cable reads as follows:
    Dear Mrs. Gordon and Mrs. Guguri, please forward to our sisters in women's organizations in all countries:
    The American aggressors have carried out inhumane germ warfare in Korea. At the same time, disregarding the solemn warnings of people worldwide, they have recently sent large numbers of aircraft to invade our Northeastern region, scattering poisonous insects containing bacteria in large quantities, and indiscriminately bombing and strafing.
    The American aggressors have already committed heinous crimes in Korea and China. Their bloody claws are threatening all of humanity, especially the lives and safety of us women and children.
    On this "March 8th" International Women's Day – a day to defend peace and protect the rights of women and children – we urge you to call upon women and mothers around the world, and all people who uphold justice and humanity, to immediately take action and launch a powerful global movement against germ warfare, to eradicate the bacteria that poison humanity and stop the bestial acts of the American bandits!
    Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The All-China Youth Federation sent a cable to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, calling on peace-loving youth worldwide to condemn the crimes of American aggressors conducting germ warfare in Korea. The cable reads as follows:
    Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth:
    From January 28th to February 17th of this year, the American invading troops in Korea used aircraft to spread insects carrying plague and cholera bacteria eight times. From February 17th to 25th, they spread poisonous insects carrying bacteria another eight times, attempting to carry out large-scale slaughter of peaceful Korean residents and the Chinese and Korean People's Forces. Since March of last year, they have been using captured personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army for bacteriological experiments. We call on peace-loving youth around the world to justly condemn and severely punish this monstrous crime against humanity and international law perpetrated by American imperialism.
    All-China Youth Federation
    March 6th
