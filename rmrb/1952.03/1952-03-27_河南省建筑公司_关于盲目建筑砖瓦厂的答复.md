    Henan Provincial Construction Company
    Response Regarding Blindly Constructing Brick and Tile Factories
    Comrade Editor: On February 26th, the People's Daily published a letter from reader Yang Jiye, exposing the fact that our company blindly constructed brick and tile factories, resulting in a loss of 6 billion yuan in state property. We express our gratitude for this criticism and have conducted an investigation.

    In September of last year, our company constructed a brick and tile factory in Xiaoyi Town, Gong County (erroneously published as Xiaoyi County, Shanxi). Due to a lack of planning for material supply and a failure to prioritize construction tasks, we wasted a total of 100.6 million yuan, with 2.8 billion yuan in tied-up capital. We did not sufficiently understand the principle that "construction must only proceed with proper design." We failed to consider production needs and the current economic situation of the country. Furthermore, leading cadres of the kiln factory and construction supervisors held bourgeois ideas about factory construction, which led to the aforementioned errors. We organized an inspection team to the kiln factory on January 17th to conduct an investigation. During the anti-corruption movement, we are further examining the waste in our company's capital construction and production.

    The discrepancies between the reader's criticism and the facts are as follows: (1) The loss, as mentioned above, was not 6 billion yuan; (2) The funds directly used for production amounted to 4 billion yuan. If we include the construction of the eighteen-door kiln and the tile machine workshop, the total would be 6 billion yuan, which differs from what was stated in the original letter; (3) There are no multi-story buildings in the factory. The cracked floor slab likely refers to the roof panel of the tile machine workshop.

### 河南省建筑公司  关于盲目建筑砖瓦厂的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    河南省建筑公司
    关于盲目建筑砖瓦厂的答复
    编辑同志：二月二十六日，人民日报刊载了读者杨继业的来信，揭发我公司盲目建筑砖瓦厂，损失国家财产六十亿元的事实。我们对于这个批评表示感谢，并且进行了检查。
    去年九月，我公司在巩县孝义镇（原误刊山西孝义县）建筑砖瓦厂。因材料供应缺乏计划，施工不分轻重缓急，我们共浪费了一亿零六百多万元，积压资金达二十八亿元。我们对于“必须有正确设计才能施工”的精神体会不够，我们没有从生产需要和国家当前的经济情况出发，窑厂领导干部和施工主管方面，又有资产阶级的建厂思想，这就造成了上述的错误。我们已在一月十七日组织检查组到窑厂作了检查。在反贪污运动中，我们正进一步检查我公司基本建设与生产中的浪费。
    读者批评与事实出入之处如下：（一）损失如上所述，并无六十亿元；（二）直接用在生产上的款项有四十亿元，如果包括建筑的十八门窑和瓦机房在内，则有六十亿元，与原文所说不同；（三）该厂无楼房，所指楼板有裂缝，想系指瓦机房屋面板而言。
