The extremely savage American imperialism has suffered heavy blows in nearly two years of its war of aggression against Korea. Since being forced to accept the armistice talks, which have lasted for more than eight months, it not only shows no sign of repentance but also, in every way, brazenly obstructs the armistice talks and stands against international conventions and human justice, committing the heinous crime of large-scale germ warfare.

Since January 28th of this year, American invading forces' military aircraft have continuously scattered various insects carrying bacteria over the positions and rear areas of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, arousing boundless anger from the people of China and Korea and peace-loving people around the world. The governments of China and Korea have issued statements of serious protest. The people of China and Korea and the people of the world have also been constantly protesting. The U.S. government has been trying its best to quibble and deny it. On the 4th of this month, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson issued a shameless statement, falsely claiming: "United Nations forces have not engaged in and are not now engaging in any form of germ warfare." But the truth of the matter is that the American invading forces are not only continuing to spread bacteria in Korea, but also, from February 29th to March 5th, expanded the area of germ warfare to within our national territory. During these six days, American invading forces dispatched 68 batches of military aircraft, totaling 448 sorties, to invade our northeastern airspace, scattering large quantities of insects carrying bacteria in Fushun, Xinmin, Andong, Kuandian, Linjiang, and other places, and bombing and strafing the Linjiang and Changdianhekou areas. These ironclad facts prove that the American imperialists' plot to cruelly and indiscriminately massacre the Chinese and Korean people and attempt to prolong and expand the Korean War is completely exposed.

American imperialists had already prepared for germ warfare before World War II. As early as 1925, among all the major powers at the time, only the United States and Japan refused to ratify the Geneva Convention against germ warfare. After the end of World War II, American aggressors immediately nurtured a large number of Japanese germ warfare criminals, such as Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano, to secretly research, manufacture, and experiment with various bacterial weapons. Recently, they even used captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers as experimental subjects for bacterial weapons. These are all well-known facts.

Regarding this inhuman, heinous, and insane act of barbarity by the American imperialists, the Chinese democratic parties and the people of the whole country thoroughly support the solemn statements made by Minister Zhou Enlai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government on February 24th and March 8th. In order to safeguard human justice, defend peace in Asia and the world, and ensure the safety of ourselves and mankind, we must wage a resolute struggle against the American aggressors who use bacterial weapons, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal.

The Chinese democratic parties hereby solemnly call on the people of all China: The increasing madness of American imperialism only shows its increasing isolation and desperation. We, the Chinese people, must unite ourselves, unite the people of Asia and the people of the world, and resolutely respond to the mad provocations of the American aggressors. We must continue to strengthen the just action of resisting America and aiding Korea, thoroughly complete the task of fighting corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and further practice increasing production and practicing economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and give the germ warfare criminals a devastating blow.

The Chinese democratic parties hereby issue a solemn call to all peace-loving people in Asia and the world (including the American people and the Japanese people) and all organizations fighting for peace: The heinous crimes committed by the American aggressors are not only a serious threat to human safety, but also an extreme insult to human dignity. The disaster that fell on the heads of the peaceful people of Korea yesterday has already fallen on the heads of the peaceful people of China today. If the heinous crimes of the American imperialists are not effectively stopped immediately, the same disaster will surely fall on the heads of the peaceful people of the whole world tomorrow. For the sake of human dignity and for the sake of world peace, we must rise up, unanimously condemn the American imperialists, and impose the most severe sanctions on the germ warfare criminals.

Justice belongs to us, and victory will surely belong to us.

    中国各民主党派对于美国帝国主义进行细菌战的抗议
    空前残暴的美国帝国主义在将近两年的侵略朝鲜的战争中遭受到惨重打击，被迫接受停战谈判以来已经八个多月了，它今天不仅毫无悔祸的念头，仍然百般无赖地阻挠停战谈判，并且变本加厉地悍然蹂躏国际公约，与人类正义为敌，而犯下了进行大规模细菌战的滔天罪行。
    本年一月二十八日以后，美国侵略军的军用飞机曾连续在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军阵地和后方上空，大量撒布负荷细菌的各种昆虫，已经激起了中朝两国人民和世界爱好和平人民的无限愤怒。中朝两国政府已发表声明，严重抗议。中朝人民和世界人民也已不断提出抗议。美国政府极力狡辩抵赖，在本月四日美国国务卿艾奇逊曾发表无耻声明：诳称：“联合国军过去未进行现在也未进行任何种细菌战”，但事实的真相：美国侵略军不只是继续在朝鲜散布细菌，而且自二月二十九日至三月五日更把进行细菌战的区域扩大到我国的领土内来了。在上述六天之中，美国侵略军先后以军用飞机六十八批，四百四十八架次侵入我东北领空，在抚顺、新民、安东、宽甸、临江等地撒布大量负荷细菌的昆虫，并对临江、长甸河口地区进行轰炸扫射。这铁的事实证明，美国帝国主义如此野蛮残暴、不择手段地虐杀中朝人民、并企图延长和扩大朝鲜战争的阴谋，是完全暴露无遗了。
    美国帝国主义者在第二次世界大战以前，早就有细菌战的准备。远在一九二五年，反对细菌战的日内瓦公约，在当时所有大国中，就只有美国和日本不肯批准。二次大战结束后，美国侵略者即豢养着大批日本细菌战犯，石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏等秘密地研究、制造和实验各种细菌武器。最近并曾经用朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员作为细菌武器的实验品。这些都是人所周知的事实。
    对于美国帝国主义者这一灭绝人性、罪恶滔天的疯狂残暴行为，中国各民主党派和全国人民彻底拥护我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长，在二月二十四日及三月八日前后两次的严正声明。我们为了维护人类正义、保卫亚洲和世界的和平、保障自己和人类的安全，对于使用细菌武器的美国侵略者，必须进行坚决的斗争，不达目的，决不休止。
    中国各民主党派特向全中国人民庄严号召：美国帝国主义的愈益疯狂，只表示它的愈益孤立和绝望。我们中国人民必须团结自己，团结亚洲人民和世界人民，坚决地回答美国侵略者的疯狂挑衅。我们必须继续加强抗美援朝的正义行动，彻底完成反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争任务，更进一步地厉行增产节约，以支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，给予细菌战犯们以毁灭性的打击。
    中国各民主党派特向全亚洲和全世界爱好和平的人民（包括美国人民和日本人民在内）及所有为和平而奋斗的组织，发出庄严的号召：美国侵略者所犯下的滔天罪行不仅是人类安全的严重威胁，而且是人类尊严的极端污辱。昨天落在朝鲜和平人民头上的灾难，今天已经落到中国和平人民头上了。对美国帝国主义者的滔天罪行如不立即加以有效的制止，同样的灾难，明天必将落到全世界和平人民的头上。为了人类的尊严，为了世界的和平，我们必须奋起，对美国帝国主义者一致声讨，并对细菌战犯们加以最严厉的制裁。
    正义是属于我们的，胜利也必然是属于我们的。
