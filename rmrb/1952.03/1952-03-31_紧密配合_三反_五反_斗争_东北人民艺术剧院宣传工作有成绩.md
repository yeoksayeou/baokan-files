    Closely Coordinating with the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Campaigns
    Achievements in Propaganda Work of the Northeast People's Art Theater
    During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the Northeast People's Art Theater wrote and performed plays such as "Whom to Follow," "Those Who Understand the Times," and "Who is Attacking." This played a practical role in promoting the struggle to repel the bourgeois offensive.
    Since the theater performed "Whom to Follow" and "Those Who Understand the Times" on February 14th, and "Who is Attacking" on February 29th, they have staged over eighty performances in Shenyang, with over 102,000 viewers, including over 27,000 private industrialists and businessmen. Secondly, to enable literary and art cadres to go to the forefront of the struggle to experience life, and to help cultural centers, amateur theater groups, and night school training classes in various districts to carry out literary and artistic propaganda activities, the theater transferred 182 people to participate in the Shenyang "Five-Anti" work team. To date, they have helped 58 units rehearse plays such as "Whom to Follow" and "Those Who Understand the Times," and the five "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" songs they created have been taught directly and indirectly to over 50,000 people. In addition, the theater also established a small propaganda team, which rehearsed small programs such as the foreign film "A Dagger Hidden in a Smile" and performed in various districts more than 30 times, with more than 26,000 viewers.
    The Northeast People's Art Theater's performance was warmly welcomed by the masses because it closely coordinated with the current movement, achieving the purpose of propaganda and education to the masses, enabling workers and shop assistants to draw a clear line of class demarcation, further recognizing the ugly face of the bourgeois lawbreakers, and thus encouraging their fighting enthusiasm. For example, a shop assistant in a hardware store in the Nan District cried bitterly after watching the play, and then exposed the crimes of the manager of the store. He said: "The play 'Whom to Follow' is about me, the only difference is that our manager didn't say my mother died, everything else is the same." He Xianglin, a worker at the Cuibin Pavilion Printing Factory, held a negative attitude towards the "Five-Anti" movement because he and the manager of the factory were brothers, and did not speak at large or small meetings; however, after watching the play, he began to break through his emotional ties and fight against the manager. These plays also had a great educational impact on the industrial and commercial circles, enabling them to see the country's policies more specifically, and inspiring and promoting them to confess their illegal acts. A director of a certain Western medicine industry in Shenyang finally decided to confess to the government the problem of evading taxes of more than 800 million yuan (Northeast currency) and illegally selling anesthetics after watching the play. Some cadres of government agencies organized discussion meetings after watching "Who is Attacking" to promote the anti-corruption movement. For example, after the cadres of the Northeast Film Management Company watched the play, many corrupt elements confessed their problems; the corrupt element Wang Dehua confessed that night to embezzling and accepting bribes of 30 million Northeast currency and investing 10 million yuan in a soda factory, and said: "The situation of being dragged into the water by奸商 is similar to that of Li Youxin in the play."
    The Northeast People's Art Theater's public performances and the achievements it has made accurately illustrate the importance of literary and art workers closely integrating with reality and connecting with the masses. In addition, the Shenyang Municipal Savings and Inspection Committee gave great help and support to the theater in this performance - mobilizing and organizing the broad masses, especially organizing industrialists and businessmen throughout the city to watch the play, which also shows that literary and art propaganda work should be closely linked with relevant departments. These experiences are worth learning from by literary and art departments in various regions.
    In order to carry out the propaganda of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements more widely, the Northeast People's Art Theater has transferred more than 50 cadres from the drama troupe and set off on March 10th to tour Dalian, Jilin, Harbin, Qiqihar and other places.

    紧密配合“三反”“五反”斗争
    东北人民艺术剧院宣传工作有成绩
    在“三反”“五反”运动中，东北人民艺术剧院编写和演出了“跟谁走”“识时务者”“是谁在进攻”等话剧。这对于打退资产阶级进攻的斗争，起了实际的推动作用。
    该院自二月十四日演出了“跟谁走”“识时务者”，二月二十九日演出“是谁在进攻”以来，计共在沈阳已演出八十多场，观众十万二千多人，其中有私营工商业者二万七千余人。其次，为使文艺干部们投入斗争的最前线去体验生活，并帮助各区文化馆、业余剧团和夜校训练班开展文艺宣传活动，该院曾抽调一百八十二人参加了沈阳市的“五反”工作队。到目前为止，他们已帮助了五十八个单位排演了“跟谁走”“识时务者”等话剧，他们创作的五首“三反”“五反”歌曲已直接和间接教会五万多群众。此外，该院还成立了一个小型宣传队，排演了洋片“笑里藏刀”等小节目，赴各区演出了三十余场，观众有二万六千余人。
    东北人民艺术剧院的这次演出，由于紧紧地配合了当前的运动，受到了群众热烈的欢迎，达到了对群众宣传教育的目的，使工人、店员划清了阶级界限，进一步认识了资产阶级违法分子的丑恶面目，从而鼓舞了他们的斗争热情。如南市区某五金行的一个店员，看完剧回去痛哭了一场，以后便把该行经理的罪行都揭发了。他说：“‘跟谁走’这个戏就是演的我，所不同的就是我们经理没说我妈妈死，其他都一样。”萃斌阁印刷厂的工友何祥林因和该厂经理是师兄弟，对“五反”运动抱着消极态度，大会小会都不发言；但在看过剧后便开始打破情面，向经理作斗争。这些戏对工商界的教育也很大，使他们更具体地看到了国家的政策，启发和推动了他们坦白自己的违法行为。沈阳西药业某理事在看了剧后，终于决心把偷税八亿多元（东北币），和违法贩卖麻醉剂等等的问题向政府交代了。有的机关干部在看过“是谁在进攻”以后组织了讨论会，推进了反贪污运动。如东北影片经理公司的干部看过此剧后，不少贪污分子交代了自己的问题；贪污分子王德化当晚即坦白了贪污和受贿东北币三千万元及在汽水厂入股一千万元的材料，并说：“自己被奸商拉下水的情况和剧中李有新相似。”
    东北人民艺术剧院这次公演及其所取得的成绩，确切地说明：文艺工作者密切结合实际、联系群众的重要性。另外，该院在这次演出当中，沈阳市区节约检查委员会曾予以大力帮助和支持——发动和组织广大的群众、特别是组织了全市的工商业者去看剧，这也说明文艺宣传工作应和有关部门取得密切联系。这些经验，都值得各地文艺部门吸取。
    东北人民艺术剧院为了更广泛地进行“三反”“五反”运动的宣传，已从该院话剧团抽调出五十余名干部，自三月十日赴旅大、吉林、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔等地作巡回演出。
