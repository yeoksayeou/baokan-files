    Many Economic Workers Neglect Reading Newspapers; Relevant Authorities Should Provide Specific Guidance
    ——Summary of Readers’ Letters
    Workers in enterprises and institutions such as the Third and Fourth Sales Departments of the Beijing Company of China Department Store, the First District Joint Cooperative of the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Beijing Company of China Salt Industry Corporation, and the First Grain Depot of the Beijing Grain Company generally exhibit a serious neglect of reading newspapers. Among the more than 190 employees of the Third Sales Department of the Beijing Company of China Department Store, only 10% read newspapers conscientiously, 40% do not read newspapers at all, and the rest only occasionally glance at the headlines. In the Fourth Sales Department, only a small number of the 55 employees read newspapers, and some only look at movie advertisements. The vast majority of people in the First District Joint Cooperative of the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative do not read newspapers; those who do mostly look at the "Daily Market Quotations" or things that they find interesting.

    Because many economic workers do not pay attention to reading newspapers, they are ignorant of major political events at home and abroad. They lack due understanding of the vigorous "Three-Anti" Movement, and they only have a superficial understanding of the rampant attacks launched by the bourgeoisie against the working class over the past three years. The bacteriological warfare launched by American imperialism has aroused the anger of the broad masses of the Chinese people and the people of the world, but many cadres in enterprises and institutions such as the First and Third Sales Departments of the Beijing Department Store, the Ninth District Cooperative, and the First Grain Depot of the Beijing Grain Company are completely unaware of this, and some cadres do not fully understand this matter. This is a very serious situation!

    Why do these economic workers pay so little attention to reading newspapers? There are two reasons: one is that these comrades are busy with work, and some have a low level of education. For example, Zhang Shihua, a salesperson at the Third Sales Department of the Beijing Department Store, said that he has been working for more than two years and rarely reads newspapers because he doesn't have time. Many people reflected that they don't have time to read the newspaper on the day it is published,
    and they keep putting it off day after day, until they simply stop reading it altogether. Some of them are limited by their level of education and do not have the ability to read newspapers. The other reason, which is also the main reason, is that leading cadres have not paid attention to leading the work of reading newspapers. The above-mentioned economic workers all pointed out that, given the limited time and low level of education, leading cadres should give them a certain amount of time and organize them to read newspapers in a guided and planned way. However, some leading cadres have not done so.

    Why haven't these leading cadres led the workers to read newspapers? It turns out that some leading cadres themselves neglect studying newspapers. Ma Shumin, the person in charge of cadre education and ideological leadership at the First Grain Depot of the Beijing Grain Company, often
    doesn't read newspapers himself. He does not know about the "Kiva incident" in Wuhan or the crimes of American imperialism in spreading bacteria in Northeast China and Qingdao. He said that before the "Three-Anti" Movement, he could still read the headlines in the newspaper, but after the "Three-Anti" Movement, he had to "fight tigers" and also deal with business, and he didn't even have time to read the headlines. Wang Jinchen, Deputy Manager of the Beijing Company of China Salt Industry Corporation, didn't even know what kind of organization the "Star Four Dinner Party" was, and he didn't even know the main content of the Beijing public trial of corrupt officials on February 1st. Obviously, these leading cadres do not understand that the Party newspaper is a weapon for publicizing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and guiding actual struggle. Therefore, they use the excuse of being busy with work and do not read newspapers. In the midst of sharp political struggle, their work is even busier, so they read newspapers even less. They do not understand that at such times, all workers need to read newspapers even more carefully. Otherwise, how can they carry out work and struggle?

    All enterprises and institutions should attach importance to the work of economic workers reading newspapers; they should make reading newspapers a regular and extremely important part of cadre education, give cadres a certain amount of study time, and provide specific guidance. Only by raising the political awareness and ideological level of economic workers can we do a good job in the country's economic work. It is hoped that the responsible cadres of these institutions will earnestly check the situation of newspaper reading.

### 许多经济工作人员忽视读报  有关机关应该加以具体领导——读者来信综述

    许多经济工作人员忽视读报  有关机关应该加以具体领导
    ——读者来信综述
    中国百货公司北京市公司第三和第四门市部、北京市供销合作社第一区联合社、中国盐业公司北京市公司、北京市粮食公司第一粮栈等企业机关的工作人员，普遍存在着忽视读报的严重情况。中国百货公司北京市公司第三门市部一百九十多人中，认真阅读报纸的人只占百分之十，根本不看报的人占百分之四十，其余的人只是偶尔看一看大标题。第四门市部五十五人中，看报的人只占极少数，有些人只是看看电影广告。北京市供销合作社第一区联合社绝大多数的人是不看报纸的，有些看报的人，多半是看看“每日行情”或自己感到有趣味的事情。
    许多经济工作人员由于不注意阅读报纸，他们对于国内外发生的重大政治事件是无知的。他们对于轰轰烈烈的“三反”运动缺乏应有的认识，对于三年来资产阶级向工人阶级展开的猖狂进攻只是一知半解。美帝国主义发动的细菌战已经引起我国广大人民和全世界人民的愤怒，但是北京市百货公司第一、三门市部、九区合作社、北京市粮食公司第一粮栈等企业机关的不少干部，竟然不知道有些干部对于这件事情却不很了解。这是一种多么严重的情况！
    为什么这些经济工作人员这样不注意读报呢？有两个原因：一是这些同志工作较忙，有些人文化水平较低。比如，北京市百货公司第三门市部业务员张世华说：他参加工作二年多了，因为没有时间，很少看报。很多人反映：当天的报纸没有时间看，
    一天天拖下去，索性就不看了。其中有些人则受到文化水平的限制，没有读报的能力。另一个原因，也是主要的原因，则是领导干部没有注意领导读报工作。上述经济工作人员都指出，在时间很少和文化水平很低的情况下，领导干部应该给他们一定的时间，有领导、有计划地组织他们读报。但是，有些领导干部却没有这样作。
    为什么这些领导干部没有领导工作人员读报呢？原来有些领导干部，他们自己就忽视报纸学习。北京市粮食公司第一粮栈的负责人马树民专门负责该单位干部教育和思想领导工作，但是他自己却经常
    不看报。他对于武汉市发生的“纪凯夫事件”和美帝国主义在我国东北、青岛散布细菌的罪行都不知道。他说：在“三反”以前，还能看看报纸上的大标题，“三反”以后，又要“打虎”，又要搞业务，连看大标题都顾不上了。中国盐业公司北京市公司副经理王荩臣竟不知道“星四聚餐会”是个什么性质的组织，他甚至不知道二月一日北京公审贪污犯大会的主要内容。显然，这些领导干部不了解党报是宣传马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想、指导实际斗争的武器，因此，他们藉口工作忙，竟不看报。在尖锐的政治斗争中，他们的工作更忙，因此更不看报了。他们不了解，在这种时候，所有的工作人员，越发需要好好读报。否则，凭什么进行工作和斗争呢？
    各企业单位应该重视经济工作人员阅读报纸的工作；应该把读报作为干部教育的经常的极重要的内容，给干部一定的学习时间，并且加以具体领导。只有提高了经济工作人员的政治觉悟和思想水平，才能做好国家的经济工作。希望这些机关的负责干部切实检查读报工作的情况。
