    In Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, an old revolutionary base area with good work performance, the feudal marriage system was basically destroyed during the War of Resistance Against Japan. In recent years, the Marriage Law has been implemented, and a new marriage system has been basically established in the county, creating a new atmosphere of unity and joy in production everywhere. Among the 1,695 couples who married from May of the year before last to November of last year, 82 percent were truly independent and voluntary. Young men and women have established happy and fulfilling families after freely marrying. Li Tianrong and Li Fenglan from Baihe Village have a very good relationship after marriage. Both are actively engaged in labor and have built three houses in three years. Wang Zhitin, a revolutionary disabled soldier from the same village, learned various agricultural production techniques with the help of Li Xiantao after they married; Wang Zhitin also helped Li Xiantao learn more than 700 characters. Li Keshu and Bao Xianze from Xiabaizhang Village are known as "model couples" in the whole village after their free marriage. They go to the fields together and attend people's schools together. Zhang Zhirong and Ren Guihua, a good laboring couple praised by everyone in Zhaiping Village, have been actively engaged in labor and production after their free marriage. They have acquired a lot of furniture and bought a cow. Li Changyin, the village chief of Baijiazhuang Village, and Hao Gaiying have been model cadres for three consecutive years since their marriage three years ago. In addition to taking on the family's production tasks, Hao Gaiying often helps the village chief deliver notices and reports to various natural villages. The masses call Hao Gaiying "the village chief's good assistant."
    Free marriage has become a social trend in rural Wuxiang County. Parents generally listen to their children's independence and voluntariness in marriage matters. Many elderly people in their 50s and 60s also marry freely. In Baijiazhuang Village alone, there are ten pairs of elderly people who have married freely, and the old couples help each other through their later years.
    Young men and women's correct view of love is gradually growing. Their love is often established in people's schools, mutual aid groups, and various work activities. Li Yuexian and Li Laiwang, who are in love in Baijiazhuang Village, have been playing together since they were young, and when they grew up, they studied together in people's schools, urging and helping each other. Many people say admiringly: "This couple will have no problem after marriage, and they will be another good couple." There is also a young couple in Hongshui Village who are in love. They have been in love for two years because they often meet at meetings and have feelings for each other. People in the village say: "They are guaranteed to have a good life after they get married." Public opinion praises these correct free love affairs, and the feudal customs that unmarried men and women cannot meet have been swept away.
    With the reform of the marriage system, there have also been significant changes in the relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. The phenomenon of mothers-in-law beating and scolding daughters-in-law no longer exists. They all regard their daughters-in-law as their own daughters. Sun Guinu, a 60-year-old family member of a revolutionary soldier in Zhaiping Village, often says: "A daughter-in-law is the same as a daughter, except that I didn't give birth to her. I love her, and she respects me." Many daughters-in-law go out to meetings or attend people's schools, and their mothers-in-law cook food at home and wait for them to come back to eat. Liu Siming's mother in Hongshui Village sent her daughter-in-law to a senior primary school to study. She said: "While I can still move around for these two years, let the young people study and earn some culture. Aren't sons, daughters, and daughters-in-law all equally close?" Xu Lamei, a model family member of a revolutionary soldier in Yaoshanggou Village, returns from the fields, and her mother-in-law brings her soup and water. When Xu Lamei goes to the county to attend a meeting, her parents-in-law provide her with travel expenses. Shi Cunhuan from Baihe Village often teaches his mother-in-law, Qiao Huanlian, to read and learn culture.
    The establishment of the new marriage system in Wuxiang County has been achieved through a long-term struggle. In the past, the feudal buying and selling marriage system seriously dominated the local rural areas. Poor people sometimes could not get married even after working as long-term laborers for more than ten years; the system of child brides was very common; many women committed suicide or were killed because of the lack of freedom in marriage. Zhao Chengguan from Beipotou Village spent 300 silver dollars to buy a wife. The relationship was not good after marriage, and he did not dare to propose a divorce. Later, the woman committed suicide by jumping into a well. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Provisional Marriage Regulations were promulgated by the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region People's Government, and young men and women gradually gained freedom of marriage. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, the marriage freedom of the broad masses of people has been more effectively legally guaranteed, and the new marriage system has been further consolidated.

    山西省武乡县在婚姻关系上的新气象
    武乡县是山西老区一个工作较好的县份，在抗日战争时期，封建的婚姻制度就已基本摧毁，近年来又推行了婚姻法，新的婚姻制度在该县已基本上建立起来，到处是团结生产喜气洋洋的新气象。全县自前年五月到去年十一月结婚的一千六百九十五对夫妇中，真正自主自愿的就占百分之八十二。青年男女自由结婚后，建立了幸福美满的家庭。白和村的李天荣和李凤兰结婚后感情很好，两人都积极劳动，三年时间就修了三间房。同村的革命残废军人王智庭和李先桃结婚后，在李先桃的帮助下，学会了各种农业生产技术；王智庭也帮助李先桃认识了七百多字。下白漳村的李克书和暴仙则在自由结婚后被全村称为“模范夫妇”，两人一同下地，一同上民校。寨坪村人人称颂的一对好劳动张志荣和任桂花，自由结婚后，积极劳动生产，置办了不少傢具，还买下了一头牛。白家庄村长李长银和郝改英结婚三年，连当了三年模范干部。郝改英除担当全家生产任务外，还经常帮助村长把通知和报告等送到各自然村去。群众称郝改英为“村长的好助手”。
    自由结婚在武乡县农村中已形成社会风气。父母对儿女婚事普遍听其自主自愿。五、六十岁的老年人自由结婚的也很多。白家庄一村即有十对老人自由结婚，老夫妇们互相帮助着度过他们的晚年。
    青年男女正确的恋爱观正在逐渐成长。他们的爱情常常是在民校、互助组以及各种工作中建立起来的。白家庄村正在恋爱中的李月仙和李来旺，从小在一起玩耍，长大了又一同上民校学习，互相督促帮助。许多人爱慕地说：“这一对子结了婚，没问题，又是一对好夫妻。”洪水村也有一对正在恋爱着的青年，他们因经常一起开会见面，互相有了感情，恋爱已有两年之久。村里的人都说：“他俩结了婚保险过好日子。”社会舆论对这些正确的自由恋爱是赞扬的，过去未婚男女不能见面的封建旧习已经扫除干净了。
    随着婚姻制度的改革，婆媳关系也有着显著的变化，婆婆打骂媳妇的现象已不复存在，她们都将媳妇看成自己的闺女一样。寨坪村六十岁的革命军人家属孙闺女常说：“媳妇和闺女一样，只是少生她一下，我爱她，她也敬我。”不少媳妇出去开会或上民校，婆婆就在家做好了饭，等媳妇回来吃。洪水村刘思明的母亲，将媳妇送到高级小学去学习，她说：“趁我这二年能动弹，让他们年轻人去学习学习，赚下文化没坏处。儿子、闺女、媳妇不都一样亲。”窑上沟村革命军人家属模范徐腊梅上地回来，婆婆就给她送汤送水，徐腊梅到县里开会，公婆就给打点盘川。白和村石存焕常教婆婆乔焕莲认字、学文化。
    武乡县新婚姻制度的树立是经过长期的斗争才得来的。过去，封建买卖婚姻制度严重地统治着当地的农村，穷人做十多年长工积下的钱有时还结不了婚；童养媳制度很普遍；妇女因婚姻不自由而自杀、被杀的很多。北坡头村赵成管花了三百块大洋买下个妻子，婚后感情不好，又不敢提出离婚，后来女的跳井自杀了。抗日战争时期晋冀鲁豫边区人民政府颁布了婚姻暂行条例，青年男女才逐渐争得婚姻自由。中华人民共和国婚姻法颁布后，广大群众的婚姻自由更得到了有力的法律保障，新的婚姻制度已进一步地巩固起来。    （新华社）
