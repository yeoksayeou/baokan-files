Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 25th: According to reliable sources, Japanese traitor Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida secretly wrote a letter to John Foster Dulles, consultant to the US State Department and warmonger, on February 4th. This letter exposes the US plot to rearm Japan and make it the main henchman of the Pacific aggressive bloc planned by the US. It also exposes the despicable and shameless puppet behavior of the Japanese reactionaries in betraying national interests and carrying out the US plan.
　　
Yoshida wrote in the letter: "I expressed my understanding to you at the San Francisco Conference, guaranteeing that Japan will definitely participate in the Pacific defense organization (referring to the Pacific aggressive bloc, hereinafter the same) organized under the initiative of the United States in the future, and assume important tasks in this organization; this understanding remains unchanged. The Japanese government also believes that this task is mainly a military task. Needless to say, to complete this work, Japan must have an army with modern equipment. I myself am very concerned about this aspect, and after the rearmament plan is drafted, steps have been taken to realize this plan."
　　
Yoshida complained to Dulles: "But when it comes to the domestic situation in Japan, some people openly oppose the so-called 'rearmament' and fiercely oppose the establishment of an atomic bombing base in Japan and the dispatch of our troops abroad. The most vehement opposition comes from young people and women." Then, Yoshida reported to Dulles the Japanese reactionaries' attempt to use deception and paralyzing methods to rearm Japan, saying: "Therefore, if the responsible personnel of the government openly advocate militarization, it will only have the opposite effect of what is expected, and will only fuel anti-American sentiment. This consideration has forced me to explain to the people: 'What we intend to establish is not an army, but a self-defense force.' We hope to make the people of one mind and one heart, and amend the constitution and strengthen our army as the situation develops and changes. I hope you agree with our political efforts to smoothly and skillfully implement our plan. Amending the constitution is a very dangerous thing, and we are very doubtful whether this move will succeed under the current circumstances. Since this is the case, we believe it is best to postpone the amendment of the constitution until the conditions are ripe." Yoshida said that he is "particularly concerned about" how to deal with the "possible consequences" when the separate treaty takes effect, especially how to "maintain the laws and order of our country."
　　
After begging the United States for more "aid," Yoshida shamelessly flattered his American master, saying: "Some people say that my task has been completed at the San Francisco Conference. But I myself believe that my task is to establish closer cooperation between America and Japan, and I hope you will properly assess my efforts in this regard. In the current complex situation in Japan, I have to use the term 'gradually strengthening self-defense forces' to express 'increasing new troops.' I hope you can understand this, and at the same time, I earnestly hope that you will make further efforts so that Japan can play a full role in the United Nations and the proposed Pacific defense organization as soon as possible. I also hope you realize that only after Japan is allowed to participate in the United Nations or the proposed Pacific defense organization can it openly declare militarization. I believe you understand the difficult situation I am in today, and at the same time, I believe that all my efforts in this situation are enough to win the friendship of the United States."

    日本卖国首相吉田茂给战争贩子杜勒斯的信中暴露
    美日反动派正加紧狼狈为奸重新武装日本
    【新华社二十五日讯】东京消息：据可靠方面消息，日本卖国首相吉田茂曾于二月四日秘密写给美国国务院顾问、战争贩子杜勒斯一封信。这封信暴露出美国重新武装日本、使之充当美国策划下的太平洋侵略集团的主要鹰犬的阴谋，也暴露出日本反动派出卖民族利益、执行美国计划的卑鄙无耻的奴才行为。
    吉田在信中写道：“我在旧金山会议中曾向你提出谅解，保证日本将来一定参加根据美国的倡议而组织的太平洋防御机构（按指太平洋侵略集团，下同），并在这个机构中担负重要任务；这种谅解仍未改变。日本政府并认为这种任务主要是军事任务，不用说，要完成这种工作，日本必须拥有一支有现代化装备的军队。我本人对这方面非常关心，在重整军备计划拟就以后，并已采取实现这种计划的步骤。”
    吉田向杜勒斯诉苦说：“可是谈到日本国内局势，有人却公然反对所谓‘重整军备’，并猛烈反对在日本建立一个原子轰炸基地和派遣我国军队到国外去，反对得最厉害的是青年和妇女。”接着，吉田向杜勒斯报告了日本反动派企图用欺骗和麻痹日本人民的手法来进行重新武装的阴谋，他说：“因此，如果政府的负责人员公开主张军事化，那只会得到和预期的效果相反的结果，只会助长反美情绪。这种考虑使我不得不向人民解释说：‘我们打算建立的不是军队，而是自卫队。’我们希望使人民一心一德，随情况的发展和改变而修改宪法和加强我们的军队。我希望你赞同我们为了顺利而巧妙地执行我们的计划而作的政治努力。修改宪法是非常危险的事，在目前情况下此举能否成功，我们非常怀疑。既然这样，我们认为最好延至条件成熟时再修改宪法。”吉田表示，他“现在特别关心的”是如何应付单独和约生效时的“可能后果”，特别是如何“维持我国的法律和秩序”。
    吉田在乞求美国给他更多的“援助”以后，最后无耻地向他的美国主子献媚说：“有人说，我的任务在旧金山会议中已经完成了。但是我本人认为我的任务是建立美国和日本之间的更密切的合作，我希望你适当地估计我在这方面所作的努力。在目前日本的这种错综复杂的情况下，我不得不用‘逐渐加强自卫力量’的说法来表示‘增加新军队’，这一点我希望你能谅解，同时我恳切希望你作进一步的努力，使日本能够尽早在联合国和拟议中的太平洋防御机构中起充分的作用。我并希望你认识，只有在日本获准参加联合国或拟议中的太平洋防御机构以后，它才能公开宣布军事化。我相信你了解今天我所处的困难局面，同时我相信我在这种情况下所作的一切努力足以赢得美国的友谊。”
