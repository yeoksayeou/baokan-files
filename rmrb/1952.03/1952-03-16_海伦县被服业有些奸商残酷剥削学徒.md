    Some Unscrupulous Merchants in Hailun County's Garment Industry Cruelly Exploit Apprentices
    To the Editor: Some unscrupulous merchants in the garment industry of Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, are cruelly exploiting apprentices. These merchants, taking advantage of the apprentices' desire to learn skills, have created a method of charging fees for "teaching apprentices quickly." Cui Fengge, manager of Chunlin Tailor Shop, used the lure of teaching apprentices in three months, and had apprentice Sun Wenxiu pay 300,000 yuan in "fast-track teaching" fees. However, after Sun Wenxiu did many days of odd jobs, he was unreasonably fired by Cui. Several other shops have similar situations. The apprentices in these shops are about to complete their apprenticeships, but have not learned how to make clothes. Some unscrupulous merchants violate labor laws and damage the apprentices' health. Zhang Shou Zeng, manager of Tongyixiang Store, often ordered apprentice Chang Diankui to work until 12 o'clock at night, and sometimes until dawn. Some unscrupulous merchants restrict apprentices from joining the trade union and participating in political activities. When the garment industry union convened a meeting for apprentices, the shop owners made various excuses to prevent them from attending. The unscrupulous merchant Yu Yongjiang even said: "You apprentices are not workers, how can you join the trade union? If you join and there are too many meetings, I won't want you anymore!" He also does not allow apprentices to rest, leaving apprentices with no time to participate in political activities. We request the government to deal with these unscrupulous merchants and protect the interests of the apprentices. Ding Ke

    海伦县被服业有些奸商残酷剥削学徒
    编辑同志：黑龙江省海伦县被服业有些奸商残酷剥削学徒。这些奸商抓住学徒要求学习技术的心理，创造了“教快徒”收钱的办法。春林洋服店经理崔凤阁，以三个月教会学徒为钓饵，让学徒孙文秀付了三十万元“教快徒”费。但孙文秀作了很多天的零活后，就被崔无理地开除了。还有几家商店也有这样的情况。这几家商店的学徒，学习已快满，但没有学会做衣服。有的奸商违犯劳动法，损害学徒健康。同意祥号经理张守增，经常令学徒常殿魁工作到晚十二点钟，有时一直作到天亮。有些奸商限制学徒参加工会和政治活动。被服业工会曾召集学徒开会，店主们提出各种藉口阻止他们参加。奸商于永江竟说：“你们学徒不是工人，怎能参加工会，你们参加后开会一多，我就不要你们啦！”他还不让学徒休息，使学徒无暇参加政治活动。我们要求政府处置这批奸商，保护学徒的利益。丁克
