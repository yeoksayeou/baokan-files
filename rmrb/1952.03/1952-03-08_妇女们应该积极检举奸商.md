    Women Should Actively Report Unscrupulous Merchants

    Editor: As we commemorate our own holiday, it is also a time when the nationwide anti-corruption, anti-embezzlement, and anti-bureaucratism movement is in full swing. In the face of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the revolutionary ranks, women across the country should recognize the ugly face of the bourgeoisie. The few women who have been used as sugar-coated bullets by the bourgeoisie should also thoroughly awaken. We women should stand up in this great movement, on the one hand, cleansing ourselves of the poisonous influence brought to us by the bourgeoisie, and on the other hand, actively participating in various related tasks. In particular, women who have been treated as commodities, tools, and sugar-coated bullets by the bourgeoisie must immediately break free from the mire and immediately accuse and report the shameless crimes of the unscrupulous merchants to the government.

    Only by participating in actual struggle can we women achieve true liberation. Commemorating "March 8th" with practical actions is the most meaningful.

    妇女们应该积极检举奸商
    编辑同志：我们纪念自己节日的时候，也正是全国轰轰烈烈开展反贪污、反盗窃运动的时候。在资产阶级对革命阵营的猖狂进攻中，全国的妇女应该认清资产阶级的这种丑恶面目，被资产阶级当作糖衣炮弹的少数妇女，也该彻底觉悟了。我们妇女应该站到这伟大运动之中，一方面清洗资产阶级带给我们的污毒，一方面积极参加各项有关工作。特别是曾经被资产阶级当做商品、当做工具、当做糖衣炮弹的妇女们，必须立即摆脱泥坑，立即向政府控诉和检举奸商们的无耻罪恶。
    参加实际斗争，我们妇女才可以获得真正解放。以实际行动来纪念“三八”节，才是最有意义的。
