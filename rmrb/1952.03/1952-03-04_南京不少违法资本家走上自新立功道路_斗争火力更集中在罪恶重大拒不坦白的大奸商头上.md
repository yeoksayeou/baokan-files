    Many illegal industrialists and businessmen in Nanjing have confessed their illegal activities and embarked on the road of self-reform and meritorious service. Since February 22nd, the Nanjing Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee, while continuing to deeply mobilize and organize shop employees and workers, has also been sorting out materials from all sides and announcing exemptions from criminal punishment for illegal industrialists and businessmen whose crimes are relatively minor and who have confessed relatively well. This correct measure has prompted industrialists and businessmen who have confessed better to further recognize the policies of the People's Government and to be determined to atone for their sins through meritorious service in the movement. As a result, the camp of the movement has been further expanded, the encirclement has gradually narrowed, and the firepower has been more concentrated on the major traitors who have committed heinous crimes and refuse to confess.
    The Nanjing Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee's handling of illegal industrialists and businessmen who have confessed well and are determined to repent generally involves discussion by the industrial and commercial household study group, review and approval by activists among shop employees and workers, meticulous study by the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee, and then the dispatch of personnel to solemnly announce the conclusions at meetings organized by industry. Some industries have democratic review meetings convened by the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee, and the handling methods are announced based on the opinions of shop employees and workers and the confessions of illegal capitalists.
    The illegal industrialists and businessmen who have been treated leniently have unanimously expressed their determination to atone for their sins through meritorious service. Dai Yuanlong, manager of Changtong Automobile Firm, once bribed 4 million yuan and stole more than 200 million yuan of state property. After he confessed relatively well and was given lenient treatment, he reported 26 major cases of illegal activities by other unscrupulous merchants and said that he would continue to report and atone for his sins through meritorious service in the future. Bian Zunchang, manager of Yuanchang Wood Factory, who received lenient treatment, publicly exposed the illegal facts he knew about unscrupulous merchants in the newspaper. Jiang Xixiang, manager of Huaxin Electric Welding Factory, after receiving lenient treatment, reported the crimes of unscrupulous merchants in the same industry and exposed the "alliance of life and death" he had formed with He Afo, manager of Heyongxing Iron Factory. He said, "I want to follow the government and the broad masses of people on the right path and no longer carry that stinking baggage and drill into the mud pit."
    Industrial and commercial households in various industries with fewer and lighter illegal acts originally had various ideological concerns and dared not confess, let alone report others. Some of their concerns were: major traitors have major problems, but they themselves also have problems, and if they report major traitors, they are afraid that they will seize their own weaknesses. Some were concerned that if they reported major traitors, they would suffer even more losses in doing business in the future. These concerns were all dispelled after the People's Government announced lenient treatment. They confessed their illegal acts and accused the major traitors who had committed serious violations and refused to confess, attempting to do evil to the end. Yin Dehua, manager of Siweimei Shoe Store, accused the crimes of the manager of Jiuchang Shoe Store, saying: "Once I received a batch of cotton shoe orders, and the deposit had already been paid. But the boss of Jiuchang Shoe Store actually bribed the cadres and snatched the business away. The rice that we had in our mouths could be forced out of us by the major traitors. He cut corners and made a fortune from it." Ni Huimin, manager of Wansheng Shoe Store, accused the unscrupulous merchants in the shoe industry of monopolizing the association and manipulating tax assessment. He said: "When assessing taxes, we had to pay whatever they wanted us to pay. If anyone raised objections, they would be labeled with the big hat of 'resisting taxation and disobeying the organization.' But they didn't even have accounts and collectively evaded taxes and shared the spoils, which affected state tax revenue and made us suffer."
    The materials of the Nanjing people from all walks of life for exposing the illegal facts of the industrial and commercial circles and the automatic confessions of the industrial and commercial circles have reached more than 140,000 pieces. More than 90% of the industrialists and businessmen whose crimes are relatively minor have confessed most of their problems. They have become more aware that as long as they confess thoroughly, they can get lenient treatment from the People's Government. At the same time, when their own problems are clarified, they are not afraid of being caught by the pigtails and have the courage to attack the major traitors. (Xinhua News Agency)

    南京不少违法资本家走上自新立功道路
    斗争火力更集中在罪恶重大拒不坦白的大奸商头上
    南京市已有不少违法工商业者坦白了自己的犯法行为，走上自新立功的道路。从二月二十二日开始，南京市增产节约委员会一面继续深入发动并组织店员工人，一面整理各方面的材料，对罪行较轻、坦白较好的违法工商业者分别宣布免予刑事处分。这一正确措施，促使坦白得较好的工商业者更加认识了人民政府的政策，下定决心在运动中立功赎罪。运动的阵营因而已更加扩大，包围圈逐渐缩小，火力更加集中在罪恶重大又拒不坦白的大奸商头上。
    南京市增产节约委员会对坦白较好决心悔过的违法工商户的处理过程，一般是经过工商户学习小组讨论，由店员工人积极分子审查通过，增产节约委员会缜密研究，然后派人在以行业为单位的会议上郑重宣布结论。有些行业由增产节约委员会派人召开民主审查大会，根据店员工人意见和不法资本家坦白的情况宣布处理办法。
    受到宽大处理的不法工商户一致表示要立功赎罪。畅通汽车行经理戴元龙曾行贿四百万元，盗窃国家资财两亿元以上。他坦白较好，获得宽大处理后，检举了其他不法商人重大犯法案件二十六件，并表示今后还要继续检举，立功赎罪。获得宽大处理的源昌木工厂经理卞尊昌在报上公开检举了他所知道的奸商犯法事实。华新电焊厂经理蒋锡祥获得宽大处理后，检举了同业不法商人的罪行，并揭发了他和何永兴铁工厂经理何阿佛订立的“生死同盟”。他说：“我要跟着政府和广大人民走正路，不再背着那臭包袱往泥坑里钻了。”
    各行业中违法行为较少较轻的工商户原来有种种思想顾虑，不敢坦白，更不敢检举别人。他们有的顾虑是：大奸商有大问题，但自己也有问题，检举了大奸商，怕他抓住自己的小辫子。有的顾虑是：检举了大奸商，以后做生意要更吃他们的亏。这些顾虑，都在人民政府宣布宽大处理以后消除了。他们坦白了自己的犯法事实，并控诉严重违法而又拒不坦白企图作恶到底的大奸商。斯为美鞋店经理印德华控诉久昌皮鞋店经理的罪行说：“有一次我接了一批棉鞋定货，定钱都已交了。但久昌皮鞋店的老板竟贿赂干部，把生意抢过去了。我们吃到嘴里的饭，大奸商都能逼着我们吐出来。他从中偷工减料，发了一笔横财。”万盛皮鞋店经理倪惠民控诉皮鞋业奸商把持公会，操纵评税的罪行。他说：“评税时，要我们拿多少我们就得拿多少。谁若提意见，就加上‘违抗税收，不服从组织’的大帽子。他们却连账都没有，集体偷税分赃，影响国家税收，又害苦了我们。”
    南京市各界人民对工商界犯法事实的检举以及工商界自动坦白的材料已达十四万多件。占百分之九十以上的犯法较轻的工商业者，大部分的问题已经坦白了。他们已更加认识到：只要自己彻底坦白就能得到人民政府的宽大处理。同时，自己的问题交代清楚，也就不怕抓小辫子，有勇气向大奸商进攻。   （新华社）
