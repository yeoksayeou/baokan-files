Long-Term Collusion with Unscrupulous Merchants in Speculation and Profiteering, Violating Laws and Disciplines
Li Ping, Deputy Manager of China Petroleum Company, Arrested
Li Committed Theft of State Property Valued at Approximately 270 Million Yuan

Li Ping, former Deputy Manager of the China Petroleum Company, has been arrested and brought to justice on March 9th for long-term collusion with unscrupulous merchants in speculation, profiteering, violating laws and disciplines, embezzling and accepting bribes equivalent to 279 million yuan in Renminbi since 1946, causing serious losses to the state.

Li Ping joined the revolutionary work in 1937. In 1946, he was transferred from Yan'an to work in the Military Industry Bureau of the Logistics Department of the Northeast Military Region. While serving as deputy director of a military factory, he met Sun Tingguo and Zhu Wenti, unscrupulous merchants from the Xinhua Hardware Store in Harbin, through the procurement of military supplies. Gradually, he fell into their trap through banquets and gifts. When the Northeast Liberation War was intense, the Military Industry Bureau gave Li Ping one million yuan (Northeast currency, same below) to purchase materials. The unscrupulous merchant Sun Tingguo, knowing that Li Ping controlled a large sum of money, said to him: "Old brother! You are already in your thirties and haven't found a wife yet. If you go back to the mountains this time, who knows when you'll find one. Let me take you out to play. The city is different from the mountains. A little entertainment is nothing." Li Ping accepted the invitation of the unscrupulous merchant and went to prostitutes. He used 600,000 yuan of public funds to speculate in cloth, profiting for his own extravagance. He also falsely reported prices, embezzled and engaged in malfeasance, and used 200,000 yuan of embezzled funds to jointly open the Yuchengxiang Hardware Store with Sun Tingguo. From then on, Li Ping was completely dragged into the water by the unscrupulous merchants and became a running dog of the bourgeoisie.

After Li Ping partnered with the unscrupulous merchant Sun Tingguo in business, he used his authority to steal state property on an even larger scale. According to the materials he confessed himself: In 1947, Sun Tingguo acted on behalf of the General Logistics Department of the Northeast Military Region, exchanging 20 barrels of alcohol for a private merchant's car, stealing five barrels of alcohol from it, and also embezzling during the purchase of car heads and postal cars. From 1948 to 1950, while Li Ping served as the director of the Fuel Department of the Logistics Department of the Northeast Military Region, he colluded with Sun Tingguo to process more than 400 barrels of sealing oil for the Fuel Department, illegally profiting nearly 200 million yuan, from which Li Ping received a kickback of 60 million yuan. When processing the sealing oil, Li Ping even issued military certificates to Sun Tingguo to transport more than ten barrels of hemp seed oil from Shenyang as raw materials, and in the name of the army, wrote to the Harbin Municipal People's Government to request tax exemption. In addition, he privately issued military certificates to Yuchengxiang Hardware Store to purchase two sacks of auto parts in Acheng.

Under Li Ping's strong support, the unscrupulous merchant Sun Tingguo massively plundered huge profits and stole state assets for three or four years, transforming from a small businessman into a major unscrupulous merchant with 1.2 billion yuan in Renminbi.

In the winter of 1946, while Li Ping was the manager of the Harbin Alcohol Factory of the Logistics Department of the Northeast Military Region, he also colluded with the unscrupulous merchant Wang Shourren. Li Ping once had him purchase more than 2,000 tons of barley and corn for the alcohol factory. Wang Shourren raised grain prices and stole state assets on a large scale. From 1948 to 1949, he colluded with Wang Shourren again, issuing military certificates to purchase 9,000 oil drums and repair and weld 8,000 drums in the Mudanjiang area. The repair of the drums alone caused the state to lose 76.8 million yuan. When purchasing oil drums, Wang Shourren took the opportunity to use military certificates to purchase large quantities of restricted and prohibited items such as iron wire, welding materials, explosives, and foul oil, obtaining illegal profits. In 1950, Li Ping stole 50 million yuan from the alcohol factory under the guise of repairing barrels.

After Li Ping became a loyal running dog of the bourgeoisie, the unscrupulous merchants treated him as a treasure, frequently sending money, gifts, and showing great hospitality. When he got married, the unscrupulous merchants sent shirts, bed sheets, fountain pens, waterproof watches, cameras, film, and gold rings. When he was sick, they sent canned goods and tonics. When his wife had a baby, they sent baby clothes, a small bed, and a sewing machine. To please his wife, they even sent white flour and firewood to his mother-in-law's house. In 1949, after Henan was liberated, Sun Tingguo sent a total of 70 million yuan to Li Ping's hometown. In addition to accepting a large number of gifts from unscrupulous merchants, Li Ping also used bribes and agency production funds to purchase various valuables. According to verified data, there were a total of nine watches of various types, eleven pens, six radios, eight cameras, three taels of gold, one sewing machine, and 56 pieces of fur coats, Russian blankets, and valuable clothing. The total amount of embezzlement and bribery by Li Ping amounted to approximately 279.64 million yuan in Renminbi.

In 1949, when Li Ping was transferred, he was dissatisfied with the appraisal made by the Supply Department, so he privately engraved military seals and stamps, arbitrarily rewriting the appraisal, and burned his wife Wang Fan's appraisal, seriously violating laws and disciplines.

In July 1950, Li Ping was transferred to work in Beijing. He continued to hand over 7 million yuan (Renminbi) of embezzled funds to private merchant Lin Futian to run businesses and obtain huge profits. At the same time, he maintained close contact with unscrupulous merchants in the Northeast.

When the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began, Li Ping, in order to conceal his shameful crime of acting as a running dog of the bourgeoisie, adopted various despicable means to shift the target, deceive the organization, and shield other corrupt elements such as the China Petroleum Company. He took advantage of the past disunity among the cadres of the China Petroleum Company, attempting to push the movement towards factional struggles. He deliberately made the movement in the Petroleum Company appear "vigorous" on the surface, but in reality, it was empty. He instructed Shi Shaohua, deputy director of the Fuel Department of the Northeast Military Region, and Wei Liansheng and Sun Tingguo and Wang Shourren, section chiefs of the Northeast Office of the Petroleum Company, to conceal evidence of embezzlement, bribery, and burning of account books, and to form an "offensive and defensive alliance."

During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the Ministry of Trade gradually discovered the facts of Li Ping's sabotage of the movement. Therefore, after receiving letters of accusation sent by the masses in the Northeast, it decided to dismiss Li Ping from all his positions and order him to reflect. During his dismissal and reflection period, after several urges from the leadership and the help of everyone, Li Ping confessed the above-mentioned crimes and reported many corrupt elements he knew in the Northeast and elsewhere. Therefore, based on Li Ping's major crimes of acting as a running dog of the bourgeoisie, embezzlement, bribery, and violation of laws and disciplines, and his evil deeds of organizing an "offensive and defensive alliance" to sabotage the movement after the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the Central Ministry of Trade requested approval from the Central Committee for Economy and Examination to hand him over to the people's court for legal action. During his dismissal and reflection period, Li Ping was able to confess himself and report the corrupt facts of others, so the Ministry of Trade suggested that the people's court impose a lighter sentence when sentencing him.

    长期勾结奸商投机倒把违法乱纪
    中国石油公司副经理李平遭逮捕
    李犯盗窃国家财产约值二亿七千多万元
    原中国石油公司副经理李平，自一九四六年以来，长期勾结奸商，投机倒把、违法乱纪，贪污、受贿折合人民币达二亿七千九百多万元，并给国家造成严重损失。李犯已在三月九日被逮捕法办。
    李平在一九三七年参加革命工作，一九四六年从延安调至东北军区后勤部军工局工作。他在担任兵工厂副厂长时，因收购军用器材，结识了哈尔滨新华五金行的奸商孙廷国、朱文缇，并逐渐在这些奸商的筵席、送礼等勾引下上了圈套。当东北解放战争紧张时，军工局曾交给李平一百万元（东北币，下同）购买物资，奸商孙廷国知道李平掌握巨款，就对他说：“老弟！你今年已经三十来岁的人了，还没有找个老婆，这回要是再进山沟，还不知道等到什么时候能找到老婆。我带你去玩玩，进了城市，比不得在山沟里。逢场作戏，没有什么关系。”李平就这样接受了奸商的邀请，一同嫖妓女。他以六十万元公款买卖布匹投机营利，供自己挥霍；他并虚报价格，贪污舞弊，并以贪污的二十万元和孙廷国合股开设裕成祥五金行。至此，李平就完全被奸商拖下水，变成了资产阶级的走狗。
    李平在与奸商孙廷国合股经商后，就利用职权，更大量窃取国家财产。根据他自己供认的材料：一九四七年以孙廷国出名给东北军区总后勤部说合，以二十桶酒精换私商的小汽车一辆，从中盗取五桶酒精，又在购买汽车头、邮政小汽车中从中贪污。自一九四八年至一九五○年在李平任东北军区后勤部供给部燃料处处长时，勾结孙廷国给燃料处加工四百多桶塞带油，非法获利将近二亿元，李平从中得回扣六千万元。在加工塞带油时，李平竟给孙廷国开军用证件，到沈阳运过十多桶大麻子油做原料，并假借军队名义，去信要求哈尔滨市人民政府免税。此外，还给裕成祥五金行私开军用证件，到阿城购买两麻袋汽车零件。
    奸商孙廷国就在李平的大力扶持下，三、四年来大量攫取暴利，盗窃国家资财，由一个小商人变成拥有十二亿元人民币的大奸商。
    一九四六年冬，李平在任东北军区后勤部哈尔滨酒精厂经理时，并和奸商王守仁勾结。李平曾通过他给酒精厂收购两千多吨大麦、苞米。王守仁抬高粮价，大量盗窃国家资财。一九四八年至一九四九年，又勾结王守仁，开给军用证件，到牡丹江一带收购油桶九千个、修焊桶八千个，其中仅修桶一项，即使国家损失七千六百八十万元。在收购油桶时，王守仁又乘机借用军用证件，大量收购铁丝、焊桶材料、炸药、臭油等禁购、禁运品，获取非法暴利。一九五○年，李平又以修桶名义，向酒精厂盗取五千万元。
    李平当了资产阶级的忠实走狗后，奸商们把他当做宝贝，经常送钱、送礼、献殷勤。他结婚时，奸商们就送衬衣、被单、自来水笔、防水表、照相机、胶卷、金镏子；他有病时，就送罐头、补品；他老婆生孩子，就送小孩衣服、小床、缝纫机；为了讨好他的老婆，还给他岳母家送白面、劈柴。一九四九年河南解放，孙廷国曾先后寄给李平老家七千万元。李平除了接受奸商大量礼物外，又以贿款及机关生产款子购买各种贵重物品。据已查明的计共有各式表九只、钢笔十一枝、收音机六架、照相机八架、金子三两、缝纫机一架和皮大衣、俄国毛毯及贵重衣物五十六宗。李平先后贪污、受贿总数共计约人民币二亿七千九百六十四万元。
    一九四九年李平调动工作时，曾因不满供给部对他的鉴定，竟私刻军章、图章，擅自改写鉴定，并烧掉他妻子王凡的鉴定，严重地违法乱纪。
    一九五○年七月，李平调来北京工作，他继续以贪污赃款七百万元（人民币）交私商林福田跑生意获取暴利。同时并与东北的奸商仍保持密切来往。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，李平为了隐瞒他充当资产阶级走狗的可耻罪行，曾采取各种卑鄙手段，来转移目标、欺骗组织、包庇中国石油公司等其他贪污分子，他利用了中国石油公司干部间过去的不团结现象，企图把运动推向宗派斗争。他故意把石油公司的运动在表面上粉饰成“轰轰烈烈”，而实际上却是空空洞洞的。他指示东北军区燃料处副处长史韶华及石油公司东北办事处科长魏连生、孙廷国、王守仁等，隐瞒贪污、行贿、烧账簿等罪证，订立“攻守同盟”。
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，贸易部陆续发现了李平破坏运动的事实；因此，在收到东北群众寄来的检举信后，就决定撤销李平的一切职务，责令李平进行反省。李平在撤职反省期间，经过领导数次督促，和大家的帮助，坦白了上述罪行，并检举了他所知道的在东北和在其他地方的许多贪污分子。因此，中央贸易部根据李平充当资产阶级的走狗、贪污受贿、违法乱纪的重大罪行，及其在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动后组织“攻守同盟”破坏运动的罪恶事实，呈请中央节约检查委员会批准，把他送交人民法院法办。李平在撤职反省期间尚能坦白自己，并检举别人的贪污事实，故贸易部建议人民法院在判刑时，予以从轻判处。
