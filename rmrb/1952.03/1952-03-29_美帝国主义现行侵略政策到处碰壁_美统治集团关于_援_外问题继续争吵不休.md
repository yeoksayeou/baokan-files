Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: Since U.S. President Truman submitted a message to the U.S. Congress in early March regarding the so-called "Mutual Security Program" and a report on its implementation, requesting approval for the $7.9 billion in "foreign aid" appropriations stipulated in the program for this year, the disputes within the U.S. ruling group regarding the "aid" issue have become increasingly apparent. This dispute further demonstrates that the U.S. ruling group, which has repeatedly failed in its adherence to the policy of aggressive expansion, has fallen into increasingly serious confusion and contradictions.

Following Truman's declaration that the United States would establish so-called "positions of strength" around the world, top U.S. government military and diplomatic officials, including Secretary of State Acheson, "Mutual Security Agency" Administrator Harriman, Secretary of Defense Lovett, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, have testified before the Foreign Affairs Committees of both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives for the "Mutual Security Program" since the 13th. In their testimonies, they repeatedly reiterated that the United States must continue to engage in large-scale war preparations globally. They revealed that the U.S. plan is: in Europe, to promote the war preparations of the European countries of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc through military "aid" amounting to 5 billion US dollars, with the focus on rearming West Germany and establishing fifty divisions of the so-called "North Atlantic Army." In Asia, the United States will continue to support the utterly corrupt reactionary regimes and use force to suppress the people's liberation movements. Of the more than 600 million U.S. dollars allocated to Southeast Asia for "military aid," most will be used to support the French colonialists' war against the Vietnamese people and to cultivate the military strength of the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan.

Like Truman, Acheson and others also hinted in their testimonies that following the methods of Hoover and others would be futile. They tried their best to convince American businessmen that the Truman administration's method of "aid" was the "most cost-effective" and "the only way" to carry out large-scale expansion with the United States' limited manpower and material resources. According to Bradley, this "can establish the strength of total war at a relatively low cost... at least it is a very good investment." Harriman frankly stated to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 17th the insidious and selfish nature of the so-called "aid," saying: If the United States does not give money, "European countries will have to contribute fewer troops, or the United States will have to provide an excess of armed forces, which will require five times the cost" and cause "disaster" to the U.S. aggressive schemes. He also said: "If the defense work of Western Europe is slackened, we don't know whether they can regain such an opportunity in history—the opportunity when Germany and France are willing to send troops and we control the agile North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I doubt whether we can regain the psychological tension." Therefore, according to the Associated Press, Acheson stated after explaining the stakes to the congressmen on the 18th: "I would rather have a deficit than cut the $7.9 billion foreign aid plan."

However, neither Truman nor Acheson or Harriman could present any strong facts to show that adhering to the current policy of the U.S. government, which has been running into walls everywhere, would have any future. They could not but admit that the arms program has caused serious inflation in the capitalist world. Even Harriman expressed that this made him "a little discouraged." The economic situation is particularly serious in the so-called North Atlantic Treaty countries. Acheson admitted that all these countries are "trying to overcome the threat of inflation." In the so-called "backward areas," Harriman worriedly pointed out: "The dissatisfaction expressed by the people is greater than ever before." Acheson said even more sadly: "In some countries, especially in Asia, there are trends of nationalism, desperate dissatisfaction, and the fanaticism of communism..."

Since the facts are so ruthless, despite Acheson and his party's tireless defense of the U.S. government's so-called "aid" plan, the congressmen generally expressed dissatisfaction after listening to it. Representative Richards, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said after listening to the first day of testimony from Acheson and the other three: "The question of how much the United States should spend and how much we can spend has not been answered." Republican Senator Voorhis said: "We didn't hear anything new today." Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, even roared on the 14th, blaming the government for failing to drive the vassal states that accepted U.S. "aid" to work hard as it had boasted. He said: "We have lost a lot of money in these countries," "We cannot allocate a large amount of money endlessly." The roar of this main supporter of Truman's policy in Congress fully demonstrates the extent of the U.S. imperialist's frustration in promoting war preparations plans abroad, and also demonstrates the extent of the U.S. imperialist's own financial constraints. In this case, many congressmen still expressed the need to cut the amount of appropriations and to add more stringent conditions to the so-called "aid." In this regard, Connally's opinion is representative. He advocated restricting "aid" to direct military nature, eliminating any "aid" of an economic nature, and requiring "recipient" countries to contribute more to serve the U.S. imperialist aggressive policies.

Thus, the quarrel within the U.S. ruling group over the issue of "aid" once again proves that neither Truman's current line nor the revised line advocated by his so-called "opposition" can find a way out for U.S. imperialism. No matter how U.S. imperialism calculates, its aggressive policy is destined to continue to fail.

### 美帝国主义现行侵略政策到处碰壁  美统治集团关于“援”外问题继续争吵不休

    美帝国主义现行侵略政策到处碰壁
    美统治集团关于“援”外问题继续争吵不休
    【新华社二十七日讯】自从美国总统杜鲁门于本月上旬向美国国会提出关于所谓“共同安全计划”的咨文和执行情况的报告，要求批准本年度该项计划所规定的七十九亿美元的“援”外拨款以后，美国统治集团关于“援”外问题的争吵已日趋表面化。这个争吵进一步表明：坚持侵略扩张政策而连遭失败的美国统治集团，已陷入日益严重的混乱和矛盾中。
    继杜鲁门宣告美国要在世界各地建立所谓“实力地位”之后，美国政府军事、外交首脑国务卿艾奇逊、“共同安全署”署长哈里曼、国防部长罗维特和参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷等人，自十三日起连日出席美国国会参众两院外交委员会为“共同安全计划”作证。他们在作证中反复重申美国必须坚持在全球继续大规模进行侵略战争准备。他们透露美国的计划是：在欧洲，通过数达五十亿美元的军事“援助”来推进北大西洋侵略集团欧洲国家的备战活动，中心是重新武装西德和建立五十师的所谓
    “北大西洋军”。在亚洲，美国要继续扶植腐朽透顶的各国反动政权，武力镇压人民的解放运动。在拨给东南亚的六亿余美元的“军事援助”中，大部分将用于支持法国殖民者反对越南人民的战争和培植台湾国民党残匪的军事力量。
    和杜鲁门一样，艾奇逊等人在作证中也同样暗示按照胡佛等人的办法做，是毫无前途的，并竭力要使美国商人们相信，杜鲁门政府这种“援助”方法，是以美国有限的人力物力进行大规模扩张的
    “最上算的”和“别无他途可循”的唯一出路。照布莱德雷的说法，这“能用比较不太花费的代价来建立总体战的力量……至少这是非常好的投资。”哈里曼十七日在参院外交委员会直率地道出所谓“援助”的阴险的利己性质说：如果美国不给钱“就只好让欧洲国家更少出兵，再不然就必须由美国提供超额的武装力量，而这将需要五倍的费用”，并使美国的侵略阴谋遭到“灾难”。他又说：“如果西欧防御工作废弛下来，我们不知道他们还能不能在历史上重新获得这样的时机——德法两国愿意出兵而我们控制着行动灵便的北大西洋公约组织的时机。我怀疑我们能否重新获得心理上的紧张局势。”所以，据合众社说，艾奇逊十八日在向议员们解释了利害之后表示：“宁可有赤字，也不能削减七十九亿美元的援外计划”。
    但是，不管杜鲁门也好，艾奇逊或哈里曼也好，都未能提出任何有力的事实，足以说明坚持美国政府这一已经到处碰壁的现行政策会有什么前途。他们不能不承认军备计划已在资本主义世界造成严重的通货膨胀。连哈里曼都表示这使他“稍觉泄气”。经济情况在所谓北大西洋公约国家特别严重。艾奇逊承认，所有这些国家都在“竭力克服通货膨胀的威胁”。而在所谓“落后地区”，哈里曼忧虑地指出：“人民所表现的不满情绪比以前任何时候为大。”艾奇逊更悲哀地说：“在某些国家中，特别是在亚洲，有着民族主义的潮流、绝望的不满情绪、共产主义的狂热……。”
    事实既然是这样无情，所以尽管艾奇逊等一行人舌敝唇焦地为美国政府的所谓“援助”计划辩解，议员们听了之后仍普遍表示不能满意。众院外交委员会主席李查兹在听完艾奇逊等四人第一天的作证后就说：“美国究竟应出多少和我们能出多少这问题还是没有得到解答。”共和党参议员伏利斯则说：
    “今天我们没有听到什么新的东西。”参院外交委员会主席康纳利在十四日甚至大声咆哮，责怪政府并未能如所吹嘘那样驱使接受美国“援助”的仆从国家卖力。他说：“我们在这些国家里丢掉了我们许多钱”，“我们不能无止境地拨付大量金钱”。这个杜鲁门政策在国会中的主要支持者的咆哮，充分说明了美帝国主义在国外推行备战计划中不如意的程度，也说明美帝国主义本身拮据的程度。在这种情况下，许多议员仍旧表示需要削减拨款数目，并且应给所谓“援助”加上更加严峻的条件。在这方面，康纳利的意见是带代表性的，他主张把“援助”限于直接军事性质，而削除任何属于经济性质的“援助”，并且要“受援”国家更多出力，为美帝国主义的侵略政策服务。
    这样，美国统治集团内部关于“援”外问题的争吵就再一次证明了，无论是杜鲁门的现行路线，或是他的所谓“反对派”所主张的修正路线，都不能替美帝国主义找到出路。不管美帝国主义如何盘算，它的侵略政策注定要继续遭到失败。
