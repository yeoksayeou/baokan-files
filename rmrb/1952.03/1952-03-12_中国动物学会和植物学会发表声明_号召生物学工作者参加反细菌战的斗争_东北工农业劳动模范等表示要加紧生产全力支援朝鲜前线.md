Xinhua News Agency report: The China Zoological Society and Botanical Society have issued statements protesting against the bacteriological warfare waged by U.S. imperialism. Labor models in industry and agriculture in Northeast China, model medical and nursing workers, famous women labor models, and representatives from all ethnic groups in Xinjiang unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement and pledge to take active measures to participate in the fight against bacteriological warfare.

The statements from the China Zoological Society and the China Botanical Society said: After suffering shameful defeats in the war of aggression against Korea, U.S. imperialists have blatantly torn up international conventions, disregarding the just public opinion and condemnation of the people of the world, and have resorted to unscrupulous means to carry out barbaric and brutal bacteriological warfare on a large scale. This inhuman atrocity is intolerable to every Chinese person. The China Zoological Society and the China Botanical Society hereby call upon all members and all biological workers across the country to mobilize fully, contribute all our strength, and be ready to go to Korea and Northeast China at any time to participate in on-site epidemic prevention and pest control work.

Northeast's famous industrial labor model Ma Hengchang and others, in a letter to all workers in Northeast China, called on all workers in Northeast China to turn their anger into strength, actively produce, and fully support the Chinese and Korean People's forces to severely punish the American aggressors; and actively participate in the fight against bacteriological warfare and wipe out bacterial pests! Northeast's famous agricultural labor model Han En, in a letter to all farmers in Northeast China, said: I am already over forty years old and have never lived as happily as I do now. Can we allow the American beasts to trample on our good life? Absolutely not! He called on all farmers in Northeast China to intensify production, grow more grain, and take practical actions to vigorously support the Chinese People's Volunteers and severely strike at the American aggressors. Li Jingmin, a doctor at the Northeast No. 1 Garment Factory Clinic who attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, and Lin Guiqiu, the model nursing group leader of the affiliated hospital of the China Medical University, in a letter to all medical and nursing workers in Northeast China, called on all medical and nursing workers in Northeast China to take swift action and actively participate in the battle against bacteriological warfare. Tian Guiying, a female train driver studying at the Northeast Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School, Wang Jingbin, a model female telephone operator in Andong City who persisted in working under the crazy bombing of American aircraft, and Chi Guizhen, an industrial female labor model, jointly wrote a letter to women from all walks of life in Northeast China, saying: We hope that all our sisters in Northeast China, in order to defend our beautiful lives, defend our beloved motherland and children, will take active action, strive to complete their work tasks and production tasks in their respective positions, support the People's Volunteers, and participate in the fight against bacteriological warfare.

Representatives attending the Xinjiang Provincial and Dihua Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee unanimously condemned the towering crimes of the American aggressors in invading our country's airspace and using bacteriological weapons. They firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on March 8, and called on the 5.3 million people of all thirteen ethnic groups in Xinjiang to organize themselves more actively, increase production, and practice thrift to support the Chinese People's Volunteers; and called on all traditional Chinese and Western medicine and health workers in Xinjiang to actively study methods of epidemic prevention and bacterial extermination, and prepare to go to Korea and Northeast China to fight for the eradication of bacteria.
