Two of the six winners of the 1951 Stalin International Prize for "Strengthening International Peace" are women: German writer Anna Seghers and British Labour Party veteran Mrs. Felton. Sisters around the world who love peace are honored and proud of Anna Seghers and Mrs. Felton for winning the award.

During our National Day last year, Anna Seghers came to Beijing to attend the celebrations. This gray-haired German writer in her fifties has long yearned for liberated China. She has been concerned about China's revolutionary struggle for more than twenty years, and has also known some progressive Chinese friends. In her novels, she has written about stories of the Chinese revolutionary struggle more than once.

Anna Seghers joined the Communist Party in college and has been engaged in revolutionary literary creation since 1920. Standing on the position of the working class, she used her pen to fight for the interests of the working people. The reactionary rulers of Europe feared the inspiring power of her works among readers, but the readers welcomed her. They knew that the flames of fascism would be extinguished by people's just struggle, and that the final victory would belong to the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.

After Hitler came to power, Anna Seghers was forced into exile in France and Mexico. Her works "The Price of Heads" and "The February Road" were successively published, writing about the struggle of the German people and the anti-fascist struggle of Austrian workers.

Her most outstanding novel, "The Seventh Cross," was written in 1938. The Chinese translation has been published by People's Literature Publishing House. It tells the story of seven anti-fascist fighters who escaped from a Hitler concentration camp. Some were caught back, some died on the road, and only one outstanding communist finally escaped the clutches of the Nazis under unbelievable difficulties. This feat made the comrades still in the concentration camp rejoice and be proud. This novel tells readers that the anti-Nazi forces are invincible and will grow to infinite strength; and that no matter how fierce and vicious the fascist rule is, the united strength of the working class can destroy it. Her brilliant prophecy has been fully confirmed by subsequent world history. Now she has returned to her motherland, the German Democratic Republic, and she is enthusiastically throwing herself into the forefront of the movement to defend world peace.

Last June, we read in the newspaper about the persecution of Mrs. Felton by the British government. That was because in May last year, she was invited by the International Democratic Women's Federation to participate in the International Women's Investigation Group on the atrocities committed by the US military and the Lee Seung-man bandit army in Korea. After returning home, she bravely exposed the truth of the US imperialist aggression against Korea and condemned the atrocities of the US imperialism and the Lee Seung-man gang in slaughtering peaceful residents at press conferences and other gatherings, completely bankrupting the deceptive propaganda of the British rulers to the British people.

Mrs. Felton's righteous accusation angered the US Embassy in Britain. They clamored through the British bourgeois newspapers and magazines: "Treason! Arrest Felton and try her! She should be sentenced to death!" The British government, manipulated by Wall Street bosses, ordered the removal of Mrs. Felton from her original position as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Stevenage Development Corporation, a British state-owned enterprise, in order to please its master.

However, Mrs. Felton's integrity and courage earned the respect of the broad masses of the British people and peace-loving people of all countries. The British authorities' persecution of Mrs. Felton not only aroused demonstrations by women in London, but also aroused strong protests from people all over the world. A large number of letters and telegrams from the United States, Canada, France, Denmark, Czechoslovakia and many other countries as well as all parts of Britain unanimously supported Mrs. Felton. The Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation also appealed to the British people to protest against the reactionary behavior of the British government: "Mrs. Felton has made invaluable contributions to her country and the cause of peace, and she should be honored and praised. ... Protecting Mrs. Felton is protecting peace and protecting your Britain."

The British government originally intended to accuse Mrs. Felton of treason, but under strong pressure from the masses, the Attorney General finally had to say: "There is currently insufficient evidence to bring criminal proceedings against Mrs. Felton." The fact is: Mrs. Felton's speeches and propositions about the crimes of the US and British troops in Korea (she advocated that British and US troops should withdraw from Korea) have been supported by people all over the world. It is impossible for the executioners to cover the eyes and ears of the people of the world with one hand.

    保卫世界和平战线上两位杰出的女战士
    一九五一年的“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金六位得奖人里，有两位是妇女：德国女作家安娜·西格斯和英国工党老党员费尔顿夫人。全世界爱好和平的姊妹们都为安娜·西格斯和费尔顿夫人的得奖感到光荣和骄傲。
    去年我国国庆时，安娜·西格斯曾来北京观礼。这位五十多岁的头发灰白的德国女作家，对解放了的中国向往已久。她关心中国的革命斗争已经二十多年了，也曾经认识一些进步的中国朋友，在她的小说里，曾不只一次地写到过中国革命斗争中的故事。
    安娜·西格斯在大学里就参加了共产党，一九二零年以后从事革命文学的创作。她站在工人阶级的立场，用她的笔为劳动人民的利益而战斗。欧洲的反动统治者畏惧她的作品在读者中所起的鼓舞力量，但是读者却都欢迎她。他们知道法西斯的凶焰是会被人们的正义斗争所扑灭的，最后胜利会属于以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营。
    希特勒上台后，安娜·西格斯曾经被迫流亡到法国和墨西哥，她的作品“头颅的代价”和“二月的道路”相继出版，写德国人民的斗争，写奥地利工人的反法西斯斗争。
    她的最杰出的一部小说“第七个十字架”，写于一九三八年。中文译本已由人民文学出版社出版。这是写从希特勒集中营里逃出的七个反法西斯战士。有的被捉回去，有的死在路上，只有一个优秀的共产党员在难以相信的困难条件下，终于逃出纳粹的魔爪。这一壮举，使还在集中营里的同志们欢欣、骄傲。这部小说告诉读者：反纳粹力量不可战胜，它将要生长到无限壮大；而法西斯的统治不论多么凶狠恶毒，工人阶级的团结力量是可以摧毁它的。她的光辉的预言完全被以后的世界历史证实了。如今她已回到了她的祖国——德意志民主共和国，她热烈地投身于保卫世界和平运动的前列。

    去年六月间，我们从报纸上读到费尔顿夫人被英国政府迫害的新闻。那是因为她在去年五月曾应国际民主妇女联合会的邀请，参加国际妇女对侵朝美军和李承晚匪军暴行调查团。回国之后，她在记者招待会上及其他集会上，勇敢地揭发了美帝国主义侵略朝鲜战争的真象，控诉了美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮屠杀和平居民的暴行，使英国统治者对英国人民的欺骗宣传完全破产。
    费尔顿夫人的正义控诉，激怒了美国驻英大使馆。他们通过英国资产阶级的报纸杂志叫嚣着：“叛国呀！把费尔顿押起来审判！她该判处死刑！”在华尔街老板操纵下的英国政府，为了讨好它的主子，遂下令解除费尔顿夫人原任英国国营企业斯提芬内吉建设公司董事长的职务。
    然而，费尔顿夫人的正直和勇敢的品质，获得英国广大人民和爱好和平的各国人民的尊敬。英国当局对费尔顿夫人的迫害，不但引起伦敦妇女的示威游行，也引起了全世界人民的强烈抗议。从美国、加拿大、法国、丹麦、捷克斯洛伐克和其他许多国家以及英国各地发来的大量信件和电报，一致支持费尔顿夫人。国际民主妇女联合会执行委员会也向英国人民呼吁，抗议英国政府的反动行为：“费尔顿夫人对她的国家与和平事业作了无可估价的贡献，她应该得到荣誉和赞美。……保护费尔顿夫人，就是保卫和平、保卫你们的英国。”
    英国政府原打算以叛国罪控诉费尔顿夫人，但是在群众的强大压力下，总检察官最后不得不说：“目前尚无充分的证明足以对费尔顿夫人提起刑事诉讼。”事实是：费尔顿夫人关于美、英军队在朝鲜的罪行的演说和主张（她主张英、美军队应从朝鲜撤退），得到全世界人民的拥护。刽子手们想要一手掩盖世界人民的耳目是不可能的。
