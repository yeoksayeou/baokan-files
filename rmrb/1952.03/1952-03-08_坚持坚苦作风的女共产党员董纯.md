    Female Communist Party Member Dong Chun Who Upholds the Spirit of Hard Struggle
    Yang Shu
    Comrade Dong Chun is the Secretary of the Women's Committee of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Hunan Provincial Democratic Women's Federation. As early as 1925, she participated in the revolution, and in 1926 she joined the Chinese Communist Party. For more than twenty years, she has loyally dedicated everything to the Party and the revolutionary cause, always maintaining the excellent style of hard work and plain living of a Communist Party member.
    When Comrade Dong Chun first arrived in Changsha, the preparatory work of the Provincial Women's Federation encountered many difficulties: no housing, no cadres, and heavy work tasks. But she optimistically shouldered the burden of this pioneering work. At that time, the Provincial Women's Federation Preparatory Committee was preparing to hold a women's representative meeting, but there was not even a person to deliver the notices. Comrade Dong Chun unhesitatingly delivered the notices to the representatives door-to-door. The next day, the women representatives arrived enthusiastically. When they discovered that the Secretary of the Provincial Women's Committee was the same person who had delivered the notice to their door the day before, they were very moved.
    In her work, Comrade Dong Chun wholeheartedly serves the women masses. She often says, "Communist Party members serve the people, and women are the most oppressed masses. As women ourselves, we have no reason not to do women's work." When she heard the news of women being abused and murdered, she couldn't sleep at night and personally urged the democratic women's federations in various special districts to conduct investigations in order to truly understand the situation and study ways to solve the problem.
    Last winter, she went to Xiangyin to participate in land reform and led the work in Hanwan and Zhouji townships. She went deep into the poor and farm laborers to understand their living conditions and paid special attention to the rights and interests that women should obtain in the land reform. Her feet were diseased, but she disregarded the difficulty of her movements in the rain and often worked until late at night, and personally went to the district, fifteen miles away, to report on her work. Her spirit moved all the cadres engaged in land reform in the district. When the land reform work ended, many farmers in Zhouji Township came to see her off. A farmer who never liked to talk said to her with tears in his eyes: "You are really a good comrade!"
    Comrade Dong Chun is always working enthusiastically and selflessly for the Party, the country, and the people, never considering her personal living conditions. Her life has always been very simple, and she has not changed this excellent style in the slightest after entering the city. Once, the Provincial Women's Federation office bought her a thermos and a blanket, but she resolutely refused to accept them and said to the comrade in charge of general affairs: "The organization has already taken good care of me, and it is not right to spend public money again." Because of Comrade Dong Chun's clear distinction between public and private matters, the Provincial Women's Federation has not had a single item of "special care" for leading comrades to this day.
    Last winter, Hunan University invited Comrade Dong Chun to give a mobilization report on land reform. That day was very windy. She could have gone by car, but she thought, "Taking a car will not only waste gasoline, but also cost hundreds of thousands of yuan in ferry fees. Why not save money for the public?" She finally braved the wind and walked more than ten miles. Although her hands and feet were frozen, she still gave a several-hour report. More than 3,000 teachers and students at Hunan University were deeply moved by her spirit of hard work. Comrade Dong Chun is so meticulous in saving the country's resources.
    Comrade Dong Chun's spirit of selflessness and hard work has also been ridiculed by some who call her "stingy" and "conservative," but she patiently explained to them: "Hard work and plain living is the tradition of the Party, and we should always maintain this tradition and not be influenced by the bourgeoisie."
    Comrade Dong Chun's style of hard work and plain living has been consistent for more than twenty years. She is fifty years old this year. In the past, she worked underground in the areas ruled by the Kuomintang reactionaries for a long time and suffered many persecutions and ravages by the counter-revolutionaries. In 1933, she spent several years in prison in Shanghai. In the enemy's prison, she shattered the enemy's various conspiracies of threats and inducements and waged a resolute struggle against wavering elements, safeguarding the interests of the revolution. In 1941, the Party sent her to work in the rural areas of Hengyang. At that time, the economic conditions were very difficult, and Comrade Dong Chun often restricted her own food intake and insisted on working. In 1946, the Party sent Comrade Dong Chun to work in the financial department of Jinnan. Xi Guizhen, the cashier there, used public money to repair her own house. Comrade Dong Chun was very angry at her behavior of harming state property. She severely criticized Xi Guizhen and reported Xi Guizhen's wrongdoing to the Party committee, which punished Xi Guizhen. Comrade Dong Chun cherishes the country's property as if it were her own life. She often educates cadres: We must compare ourselves in work, progress, and the lives of the working people. We must resolutely oppose the bad styles of extravagance, waste, hedonism, corruption, and bureaucracy. Comrade Dong Chun is a model in upholding the Party's style of hard work and plain living.

    坚持坚苦作风的女共产党员董纯
    杨澍
    董纯同志是中国共产党湖南省委妇女委员会书记兼湖南省民主妇女联合会筹委会主任。远在一九二五年她就参加了革命，一九二六年加入了中国共产党。二十多年来她忠心耿耿地为党为革命事业贡献了自己的一切，始终保持着共产党员坚苦朴素的优良作风。
    董纯同志初到长沙的时候，省妇联筹委会的工作遇到了很多困难：没有房子，没有干部，工作任务又很繁重，但她乐观地肩负起这开创工作的重担。当时省妇联筹委会准备召开一个妇女代表会议，竟连一个送通知的人都没有，董纯同志毫不犹豫地亲自把通知逐户送到代表手里。第二天，妇女代表到得很踊跃，当她们发现省妇委书记就是头天上门送通知的人的时候，都很感动。
    在工作中，董纯同志是全心全意地为妇女群众服务。她常说：“共产党员是为人民服务的，妇女是最受压迫的群众，我们身为妇女，没有理由不做妇女工作。”当她听到妇女被虐杀的消息时，晚上睡不着觉，亲自督促各专区的民主妇女联合会进行调查工作，以便切实了解情况，研究解决这一问题的办法。
    去年冬天，她到湘阴参加土地改革，领导韩湾、周济两个乡的工作。她深入到贫农、雇农中去了解他们的生活情况。并特别重视妇女在土地改革中应得的权益。她的脚有病，下雨天也毫不顾及自己行动的困难，常常工作到深夜，并且亲自到十五里路远的区上去汇报工作。她的这种精神，感动了全区从事土地改革工作的干部。当土地改革工作结束时，周济乡的许多农民都赶来送她，一个从不爱说话的农民也流着泪对她说：“你真是个好同志！”
    董纯同志就是这样时时刻刻热情地、忘我地为党、为国家、为人民工作着，从没有考虑过个人的生活待遇。她的生活一贯是非常朴素的，进入城市后也丝毫没有改变这种优良的作风。有一次，省妇联机关给她买了一只热水瓶、一床毯子，她坚决拒绝收受，并对管总务的同志说：“组织上对我已经照顾得很周到了，不该再花公家的钱。”由于董纯同志的公私分明，直到现在，省妇联没有一笔“特殊照顾”负责同志的账目。
    去冬湖南大学请董纯同志去作有关土地改革的动员报告。那天正刮着大风，她本来可以乘汽车去的，但是她想：“坐汽车除了耗费汽油以外，还要十几万元的轮渡费，为什么不替公家节省呢？”她终于冒着大风走了十多里路，虽然手脚冻僵了，还作了几小时报告。湖南大学三千多师生都被她这种坚苦作风深深地感动了。董纯同志就是这样精打细算地替国家节省资财。
    董纯同志这种为公忘私、坚苦朴素的作风，也曾有人讥笑她是“小气”，“保守”思想，但她耐心地向他们解释说：“坚苦朴素是党的传统，我们应该永远保持这种传统，不要受资产阶级的影响。”
    董纯同志坚苦朴素的作风二十多年如一日，她今年已五十岁了。过去她曾长期地在国民党反动派统治地区做地下工作，遭受过反革命的多次的迫害和摧残，一九三三年她曾在上海坐了几年牢。在敌人的牢狱里，她粉碎了敌人的各种威胁利诱的阴谋，并和动摇分子作了坚决的斗争，维护了革命的利益。一九四一年党派她到衡阳农村工作，当时经济条件十分困难，董纯同志经常节制自己的食量，坚持工作。一九四六年，党派董纯同志到冀南财经部门工作。该处出纳溪桂珍，曾用公家的钱替自己修房子。董纯同志对她这种损害国家财产的行为，非常愤恨，她对溪桂珍进行了严厉的批评；并将溪桂珍的错误行为反映给党委，党委处分了溪桂珍。董纯同志爱护国家的财产如同自己的生命，她经常教育干部：我们要比工作、比进步、比劳动人民的生活，我们要坚决反对那种铺张浪费、享乐腐化、官僚主义的恶劣作风。董纯同志是坚持党的坚苦朴素作风的模范。
