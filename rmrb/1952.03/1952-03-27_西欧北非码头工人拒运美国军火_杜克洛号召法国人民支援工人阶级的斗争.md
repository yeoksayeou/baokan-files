Xinhua News Agency, March 25th: According to TASS reports: For more than a month, in the Western European countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, dockworkers have continued to refuse to load and unload American war materials, strongly demonstrating the will of the Western European people to oppose American war policies.

In the Italian port of Genoa, dockworkers with a glorious record of refusing to unload American war materials refused on February 25th to unload tanks and guns transported from the United States by the Italian ship "Montreal," and they held a strike to protest the transportation of American armaments. Port authorities attempted to keep the transport of armaments secret, but dockworkers discovered the deception as soon as they began unloading. Their resolute and unified action left port authorities with no choice but to mobilize troops and police to unload the war materials. Several days earlier, in Livorno, another major Italian port, dockworkers also refused to work on several ships carrying American war materials. These armaments were to be transported to the American occupation forces stationed in Austria. The actions of the Livorno dockworkers greatly encouraged peace fighters in Austria.

In France, dockworkers at the port of Bordeaux, one of the main transport ports for the American military, have repeatedly refused to unload American war materials; on March 6th, they refused again to load ships carrying guns and cannons to Morocco to massacre colonial peoples. In Bastia, Corsica, dockworkers in mid-March, despite oppression from the authorities, refused to unload American war materials and called on residents to support their movement to refuse to handle American war materials.

In Oran, Algeria, in French North Africa, dockworkers also refused to unload armaments from the transport ship "Jules Duroch" in late February.

Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: According to TASS, Paris, March 18th: French Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Duclos delivered a speech at the French Communist Party Gironde Provincial Committee meeting, calling on the people to launch a struggle to refuse to transport and produce war materials.

Duclos first expressed, on behalf of all peace-loving French people, respect to the dockworkers of the port of Bordeaux for their heroic and repeated refusal to unload American war materials and for refusing to load ships carrying guns and cannons to Morocco to massacre colonial peoples. Duclos pointed out that the unwavering will of the Bordeaux dockworkers against war and their actions, which demonstrated true fraternity, would certainly be widely echoed by the people of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Duclos emphasized that the French people deeply understand and support the legitimate demands of the colonial peoples to gain freedom and independence, because the French people themselves have lost their independence and must restore it.

Duclos then pointed out that the transportation of American armaments on French ships and railways and the production of armaments in France under American pressure are not for the purpose of defending France's independence, but for preparing to attack the Soviet Union, for continuing the massacre of the Vietnamese people, and for maintaining the terror regime in the colonies, as well as for attacking the working people of France. It is precisely for this reason that the refusal to transport and produce armaments is becoming increasingly important. The people of France are deeply concerned about this struggle.

Duclos finally called on the people to support the dockworkers, sailors, railway workers, and ordnance factory workers who are standing at the forefront of this struggle. Duclos also expressed confidence, saying, "On this important front in the great struggle of the forces of peace against the instigators of war, the working class and the people will surely achieve final victory."

    西欧北非码头工人拒运美国军火
    杜克洛号召法国人民支援工人阶级的斗争
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社消息：一个多月以来，在北大西洋公约集团的西欧国家，码头工人们继续拒绝装卸美国战争物资，强烈地表现了西欧人民反对美国战争政策的意志。
    在意大利的热那亚港，有着拒卸美国战争物资的光辉记录的码头工人，在二月二十五日拒绝起卸意大利船“蒙利尔”号从美国运来的坦克和枪炮，他们举行罢工抗议运输美国军火。港口当局曾企图对运输军火保持秘密，但码头工人们一开始卸货就发现了这个欺骗。他们坚决一致的行动使得港口当局毫无办法，只得动员军队和警察去起卸这批战争物资。在这以前几天，在意大利的另一大港里窝那，码头工人也拒绝为装运美国军火的几艘船只工作。这些军火是要运给美国驻奥地利的占领军的。里窝那码头工人的行动使奥地利的和平战士受到很大鼓舞。
    在法国，美军的主要运输港口之一的波尔多港的码头工人一再拒绝起卸美国运来的战争物资；三月六日，他们又拒绝为载运枪炮去摩洛哥屠杀殖民地人民的船只装货。在科西嘉岛巴斯的亚港，码头工人在三月中旬不顾当局的压迫，拒绝起卸美国的战争物资，并且号召居民支持他们拒绝搬卸美国战争物资的运动。
    在法属北非阿尔及利亚的阿兰港，码头工人在二月下旬也拒绝为运输舰“让达劳”号起卸军火。
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十八日讯：法国共产党中央委员会书记杜克洛在法国共产党吉伦特省委员会会议上发表演说，号召人民展开斗争，拒绝运输和生产战争物资。
    杜克洛首先代表爱好和平的法国全体人民，向波尔多港的码头工人致敬，因为他们英勇地一再拒绝起卸美国运来的战争物资，并且拒绝为载运枪炮到摩洛哥去屠杀殖民地人民的轮船装货。杜克洛指出：波尔多港码头工人反对战争的不屈不挠的意志和他们这种表现了真正的兄弟情谊的行动，一定会得到摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚和突尼斯人民普遍的响应。杜克洛强调说：法国人民深深了解并支持殖民地人民希望获得自由和独立的合法要求，因为法国人民自己也丧失了独立，他们一定要恢复独立。
    杜克洛接着指出：用法国轮船和铁路运输美国军火以及在美国压力下在法国生产军火，都不是为了保卫法国的独立，而是为了准备进攻苏联，为了继续屠杀越南人民并维持殖民地的恐怖政权，同时也为了进攻法国的劳动人民。正是因为这个缘故，拒绝运输和生产军火的意义就越来越重大了。法国全国人民都十分关心这个斗争。
    杜克洛最后号召人民支持站在这个斗争的前线的码头工人、海员、铁路工人和兵工厂工人。杜克洛并且表示信心说：“在和平力量对战争挑拨者进行的伟大斗争中的这一个重要战线上，工人阶级和人民一定会获得最后胜利。”
