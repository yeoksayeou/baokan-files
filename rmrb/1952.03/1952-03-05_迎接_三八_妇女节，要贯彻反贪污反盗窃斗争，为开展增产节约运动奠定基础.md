    The 1952 "March 8th" International Women's Day has arrived amidst the vigorous anti-corruption and anti-theft movement. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our New China's female workers and workers' families have full determination to fight to sweep away the filth of the old society and build a bright New China.

    Looking back over the three years since liberation, our female workers and workers' families have gradually gained unprecedented happiness, freedom, and enjoyable lives, based on the increasing development of national production and construction and the gradual stabilization of prices. Especially since the Central People's Government promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations in 1951, more than 2.6 million industrial workers, both male and female, and more than 10 million workers' families have enjoyed protection for birth, old age, illness, death, and disability. There are 524 nurseries and 217 breastfeeding rooms in major industrial and mining cities across the country, an increase of three and a half times compared to the past. The vast majority of female workers and workers' families have participated in cultural studies. Through the patriotic education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the political consciousness of female workers and workers' families has also greatly improved. They have ensured the completion of national production tasks in the patriotic production emulation movement. In Shanghai, the textile industry, where female workers account for more than 75 percent, has not only overfulfilled production tasks but also donated 15 airplanes. Female workers and workers' families have conscientiously implemented patriotic pacts and actively participated in the cause of building the motherland with selfless spirit. Female workers in various industries across the country are working actively, creating advanced working methods, and improving labor efficiency, and have been rewarded by the government and factories. For example, in the transportation industry, there are 18 female train crew groups. On the Korean front, four female volunteer army truck drivers have each created a record of 8,000 kilometers of safe driving. Female workers in 41 factories in Dalian and Lushun proposed 94 rationalization suggestions. At the city's "May 1st" commendation meeting for production models, 535 female technical workers, 30 advanced workers, and 20 advanced female worker groups were rewarded. The female worker Chi Guizhen group at the Harbin Rubber Factory No. 6 formulated a production increase and economy plan, exceeding the plan by 66 percent in the first month, increasing production by 25 tons of grain. The female worker Liu Yumei blasting team at the Fushun Mining Bureau improved operating methods, increasing output seven times compared to the puppet Manchukuo era and improving quality by 100 percent. In particular, after the promotion of the fine yarn female worker Hao Jianxiu's work method in the textile industry, more than 20,000 advanced female workers using the Hao Jianxiu work method have emerged. Moreover, in the process of promotion, the content of the Hao Jianxiu work method has been further enriched and developed. For example, Guo Yueying and Cai Xiaozhen of Jiading Jiafeng Yarn Factory created a hand-cranked roving cleaning device, increasing the efficiency of cleaning work by 20 times. Liu Huimin, a female worker at Qingdao State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 3, achieved a rate of roller lapping reduced to 0.053 percent in October last year. Female workers in the textile industry are enthusiastically promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method in an all-round way, striving to achieve the goal of saving and increasing production of 44,000 pieces of cotton yarn throughout the year. In addition, female workers who have studied the 1951 weaving work method have greatly improved their tending ability, increasing the number of ordinary looms tended from four to ten, and automatic looms from twelve to thirty-two. Currently, 3,000 weavers across the country have learned the 1951 weaving work method.

    On the one hand, the broad masses of working people are diligently creating wealth for the country, and on the other hand, unscrupulous merchants and corrupt elements are shamelessly stealing, taking the fruits of the working people's labor as their own. Therefore, female workers and workers' families have risen up to actively participate in the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle. For example, a Hao Jianxiu work method worker at a textile factory in Tianjin, at a rally to denounce corrupt elements, accused law-breaking capitalists, saying: "We work hard all day long, trying our best to promote advanced working methods, increase production and practice economy for the country, and support the front lines, but you are corrupt and enrich yourselves, stealing so much wealth that we have earned with our blood and sweat!" A private yarn factory in Tianjin evaded taxes and skimped on materials, stealing more than 10 billion yuan of state funds, which is estimated to be enough to cover the full-year expenses of dozens of nurseries in large cities. Female workers, with the spirit of being masters of the country, not only filed charges at meetings but also carried out face-to-face struggles against law-breaking capitalists in peacetime. For example, female dockworkers in Foshan City, Guangdong Province, carefully checked the tax bills of capitalists' goods and put forward the slogan "No tax, no unloading; no tax, no transportation." Once, a tax-evading capitalist scolded a female dockworker: "You are a worker, what qualifications do you have to check my tax bill?" The female worker replied: "Precisely because I am a worker, I have even more responsibility to check your illegal behavior!" All our country's female workers must learn from the female dockworkers in Foshan City, take active action, fight, report, and supervise all illegal behaviors of capitalists. We must expose their crimes of undermining national construction, repel their attacks on the working class, and especially smash their conspiracies to sow discord between male and female workers.

    Female workers and workers' families throughout China must recognize that participating in the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle has even more special significance for us. In the three years since liberation, many capitalists in private factories and enterprises have not abolished, or have rarely abolished, the feudal oppression and cruel exploitation of our female workers in order to seize illegal profits. For example, private silk reeling factories, where female workers account for 90 percent, still treat female workers and child laborers lawlessly. Managers of Hongfeng and Xiecheng Silk Factories in Wuxi City have used iron nails and wooden sticks to beat female workers, kicked female workers in the abdomen, pierced the eyes of reeling workers with iron wires, dragged reeling workers by the ears and circled them in the driveway, and poured boiling water on the waists and breasts of reeling workers. In Heta Silk Factory, after starting work in 1951, reeling workers were scalded and beaten 330 times in just over a month. In addition, there is a serious phenomenon of unequal pay for equal work in private factories, with male and female workers' wages differing by about half, and treatment also varying greatly. In the anti-theft movement in the Eighth District Jiufeng Weaving Factory in Beijing, it was discovered that several female workers had been raped by the manager. In Wuhan Fuhua Clothing Factory, female workers were not allowed to breastfeed their children at night, and the child of the female worker Hu Zhiquan was frozen and starved to death outside the door. All of this shows that the feudal oppression of female workers and child laborers still seriously exists in private factories and enterprises. We must actively participate in the anti-theft struggle, resolutely oppose corruption, oppose waste, oppose bureaucracy, oppose bribery, oppose tax evasion, oppose theft of state assets, oppose the use of substandard materials, and oppose the theft of national economic intelligence. In the struggle, we must thoroughly expose the ugly facts of capitalists oppressing female workers, resolutely abolish all unreasonable systems, and lay the foundation for further implementing democratic reforms and launching the movement to increase production and practice economy.

    迎接“三八”妇女节，要贯彻反贪污反盗窃斗争，为开展增产节约运动奠定基础
    中华全国总工会女工部
    一九五二年的“三八”国际劳动妇女节在轰轰烈烈的反贪污、反盗窃运动中来到了。我们新中国的女工和职工家属，在共产党、毛主席领导下，有充分的决心为扫清旧社会的污毒，建立光明的新中国而奋斗。
    回顾解放三年来，我们女工和职工家属们在国家生产建设日益发展、物价日趋稳定的基础上，逐步得到了前所未有的幸福、自由、愉快的生活。特别从一九五一年中央人民政府颁布劳动保险条例以来，已有二百六十余万男女产业工人、一千余万职工家属享受到生、老、病、死、残的保护。全国各大城市工矿已有五百二十四个托儿所，二百十七个哺乳室，比过去增加了三倍半；极大多数的女工和职工家属，参加了文化学习；通过抗美援朝爱国主义的教育，女工和职工家属的政治觉悟也大大提高了。她们在爱国主义生产竞赛运动中，保证了国家生产任务的完成。在上海，女工占百分之七十五以上的纺织业，除超额完成生产任务以外，还捐献飞机十五架。女工和职工家属切实地执行了爱国公约，以忘我的精神积极参加了建设祖国的事业。全国各产业中的女工群众都积极工作，创造了先进工作法，提高了劳动效率，受到政府和工厂的奖励。例如在交通事业上出现了十八个女火车包乘组；在朝鲜前线，有四位志愿军女汽车司机各已创造了安全行车八千公里的纪录。旅大四十一个工厂的女工，提出合理化建议九十四件，在全市“五一”奖励生产模范大会上有五百三十五个技术女工、三十个先进工作者、二十个女工先进小组受到奖励。哈尔滨橡胶六厂女工迟桂珍小组订立增产节约计划，第一个月就超过了计划百分之六十六，增产二十五吨粮食。抚顺矿务局女工刘玉梅装炮小组，改进操作法，产量比伪满时代提高七倍，质量提高百分之一百。尤其是纺织业的细纱女工郝建秀的工作法推广后，已出现二万多郝建秀工作法的先进女工；而且在推行中，更加充实和发展了郝建秀工作法的内容。如嘉定嘉丰纱厂郭月英、蔡小珍，创造了手摇巡回清洁器，提高清洁工作效率二十倍。青岛国营棉纺织厂第三厂女工刘惠敏去年十月份已做到使皮辊花率减到百分之零点零五三的成绩。纺织业中的女工们热烈地全面推广郝建秀工作法，为实现全年节约增产四万四千件棉纱的目标而奋斗。此外，凡学习过一九五一织布工作法的女工，看台能力都大大提高，普通织机由四台提高到十台，自动布机由十二台提高到三十二台了。现全国已有三千个织布工人学会了一九五一织布工作法。
    一方面是广大劳动人民正在辛勤地为国家创造财富，另一方面奸商和贪污分子却无耻地进行盗窃，把劳动人民的劳动果实，据为己有。因此，女工们和职工家属们，都起来积极参加反贪污、反盗窃的斗争。如天津某中纺厂郝建秀工作者，在反贪污分子的大会上，控诉违法资本家说：“我们终日辛苦，想尽办法推行先进工作法，为国家增产节约，支援前线，而你们贪污自肥，盗窃了这么多我们用血汗所换来的财富！”天津某私营纱厂偷税漏税和偷工减料所盗窃国家的资财达一百余亿元，估计这笔钱可供大城市几十个托儿所全年的费用。女工们用国家主人翁的气概，不仅在会上提出控诉，并在平时对违法资本家进行了面对面的斗争。如广东佛山市的搬运女工，认真检查资本家的货物税单，提出“无税不卸货，无税不运货”的口号。有一次漏税的资本家责骂搬运女工：“你是工人，有什么资格检查我的税单？”女工回答：“正是工人，更有责任检查你的非法行为！”我们全国女工们都要向佛山市的搬运女工看齐，积极行动起来，斗争、检举和监督资本家的一切不法行为。要揭发他们破坏国家建设的罪恶，要击退他们向工人阶级的进攻，特别要粉碎他们挑拨男女工人团结的阴谋。
    全中国的女工和职工家属们，必须认识，参加反贪污、反盗窃的斗争，对我们有着更加特殊的意义。解放三年来，许多私营厂商的资本家们，为了攫取非法利润，对我们女工的封建压迫和残酷的剥削，并没有废止或很少废止。例如女工占百分之九十的私营缫丝厂，对待女工、童工依然无法无天，无锡市鸿丰、协成丝厂的管理员，曾用铁钉木棒打女工，用脚踢女工的腹部，用铁丝刺盆工的眼睛，拉着盆工的耳朵在车道里兜圈子，用开水泼盆工的腰部、乳房。和泰丝厂在一九五一年开工后，一个多月中烫打盆工达三百三十次之多。此外，私营工厂中还存在着严重的同工不同酬的现象，男女工工资相差约一半，待遇也悬殊。北京市第八区九丰织布厂在这次反盗窃运动中，发现好几个女工被经理强奸过。武汉福华被服厂，夜间不让女工给小孩吃奶，女工胡芝全的孩子在门外被活活冻饿致死。这一切，都说明了私营工厂企业中，对女工、童工的封建压迫依然严重地存在。我们必须积极起来参加反盗窃斗争，坚决地反对贪污，反对浪费，反对官僚主义，反对行贿，反对偷税漏税，反对盗骗国家资财，反对偷工减料，反对盗窃国家经济情报。在斗争中把资本家压迫女工的丑恶事实，加以彻底揭发，坚决废除一切不合理的制度，为进一步实行民主改革和开展增产节约运动奠定基础。
