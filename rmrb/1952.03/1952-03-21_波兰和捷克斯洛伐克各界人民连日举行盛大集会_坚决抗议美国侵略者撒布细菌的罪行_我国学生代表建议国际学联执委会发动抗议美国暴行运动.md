    WARSAW MESSAGE: The Polish people unanimously condemned the crime of American aggressors waging bacteriological warfare.
    On March 18, the Polish Peace Committee held a grand protest rally in Warsaw. About 4,000 people attended, including workers, engineers, scientists, other intellectuals, and university students from Warsaw. Polish renowned bacteriologist Plesmiczki said at the meeting: For many years, mankind has been fighting these invisible enemies that have taken the lives of millions. Now, the American imperialists are spreading diseases such as plague, cholera, and typhoid in towns and villages in Korea and China. We, Polish bacteriologists, appeal to bacteriologists in the United States and around the world to resolutely demand an end to the bacteriological warfare launched by American imperialism. Dzerwinski, chairman of the Polish Miners' Union, representing the miners and steelworkers of Silesia, resolutely protested the monstrous crime of American aggressors using bacteriological weapons. Cherwinka, an advanced worker from a light bulb factory in Warsaw, then spoke, saying: We demand that the World Peace Council stop the barbaric behavior of the American imperialists. The congress finally passed a resolution saying: We are the residents of Warsaw, where the ever-memorable Second World Peace Congress passed the resolution on the unconditional prohibition of the use of all weapons of mass destruction, so we have a special right and obligation today to demand that anyone who violates this ban must be punished. We, the residents of Warsaw, the capital of Poland, fully support the statement of World Peace Council Chairman Joliot-Curie and call on the people of all countries to strongly protest the use of bacteriological weapons and demand an immediate end to the crimes of the United States in Korea and China.
    The Polish Peasants' Mutual Aid Union, with two million members, as well as the Polish Writers' Association, the Polish Journalists' Association, and the Polish Composers' Association, have all lodged protests demanding the punishment of bacteriological war criminals. The latter two associations also donated 5,000 zlotys each for epidemic prevention for the Korean people. The Polish Teachers' Conference held in Warsaw also demanded that the instigators of bacteriological warfare be tried.
    Filmmakers, screenwriters, and actors attending the Polish Film Workers' Conference passed a resolution saying: "The use of such inhumane and outrageous weapons will surely arouse the indignation and hatred of people all over the world." The Polish Drama and Film Actors Association passed a resolution saying: "Let these criminals who spread plague and cholera bacteria remember that they must be punished by the people's court for the unprecedented atrocities they have committed and the suffering of innocent women and children."
    The Polish Student Union demanded that the United Nations immediately take measures to stop the crimes of the American aggressors.
    The Polish "Friends of Children Society," in the name of Polish mothers and children, expressed indignation at the crime of American aggressors using bacteriological weapons.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th] People from all walks of life in Czechoslovakia continue to express great indignation at the crime of American aggressors using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.
    The factory committee of the "Svit" shoe factory in Gottwaldov said in a letter of protest: We are extremely angry at this heinous crime of the American aggressors. We demand that the culprits of these crimes be severely punished.
    Students of the Medical School of Charles University in Prague submitted a strong protest to the United Nations, condemning the new crimes of the United States. The resolution passed by the medical students said: It is extremely shameful that there are people in the world who regard deadly bacteria as their allies. We declare that we consider those aggressors who commit such barbaric acts as irreconcilable enemies.
    The Young Pioneers of the Stalin School in the Strasnice district of Prague also submitted a letter of protest to the United Nations and called on all children in Czechoslovakia and foreign children on Prague Radio to join them in demanding an end to the Korean War. 43,000 Czechoslovak children have already signed in response to this request.
    Dr. Malek, a Czechoslovak microbiologist, National Prize winner, and professor, said: "Every true scientist who uses science to improve human life will inevitably feel extremely disgusted and indignant at those 'scientists' and 'science' who use science to carry out these crimes."
    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th] According to TASS, Budapest: The Executive Committee of the International Student Union held a meeting in Budapest from the 14th. In addition to the members of the Executive Committee, guests from Syria, Denmark, Italy, Egypt, Myanmar, Finland, and Indonesia also attended the meeting.
    After the meeting opened, International Student Union Chairman Gromann delivered a report on the International Student Union's 1952 cultural and sports activity plan. After discussing the plan, the meeting began to discuss the second agenda item on March 17: the statement by Chinese and Korean student representatives regarding the United States launching bacteriological warfare.
    Korean student representative Baek Ki-chun (transliteration) stated: The American cannibals, after failing to conquer the Korean people, have used a new means of mass slaughter - bacteriological weapons. Baek Ki-chun emphasized that no matter what the American imperialists do, they will not achieve their goals in Korea.
    Chinese representative Ke Zaishuo proposed in his speech on behalf of Chinese students that the Executive Committee of the International Student Union should make a resolution calling on students all over the world to immediately launch a campaign to stop the monstrous crime of American imperialists using bacteriological weapons.
    Buddhadev, representing Soviet students, seconded the proposal of the Chinese representative in his speech. Italian youth representative Bechetti emphasized in his speech that the task of the Executive Committee is to strongly protest the use of bacteriological weapons and to condemn those who use such weapons.
