Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 25th: The movement in Shanghai against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence, after full preparation, was officially announced to begin on the 25th. The Shanghai Municipal Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy has dispatched a large number of "Five-Anti" work inspection teams to enter factories and shops to thoroughly investigate the illegal facts of illegal industrial and commercial households.

The "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai was started after careful planning and full preparation. As early as two months ago, the Municipal Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy, on the one hand, called on the people to report the illegal facts of industrial and commercial households, and on the other hand, called on industrial and commercial households to confess voluntarily. By the end of February, the Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy had received hundreds of thousands of pieces of reporting materials and materials transferred from various agencies and troops. In order to carry out the "Five-Anti" movement in an orderly manner, the Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy concentrated a large number of staff to study and sort out the materials, and according to the standards and methods for classifying and handling industrial and commercial households promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government and the illegal facts of industrial and commercial households in Shanghai, conducted a careful ranking work, determining that about 65 percent of industrial and commercial households were law-abiding households and basically law-abiding households, about 30 percent were semi-law-abiding and semi-illegal households, and the rest were seriously illegal and completely illegal households, so as to deal with them separately. At the same time, the Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy organized and trained the teams participating in the "Five-Anti" movement, first training more than 10,000 workers and shop assistants in districts, conducting class education for them, and explaining the significance of carrying out the "Five-Anti" movement. By mid-March, the Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy had transferred a large number of cadres from various agencies and troops, and formed "Five-Anti" work inspection teams with trained workers, shop assistants, and some cadres from other places in Shanghai to investigate "Three-Anti" materials, conducted policy education and discipline education for them, and emphasized that the "Five-Anti" movement must be combined with production, that is, on the one hand, the "Five-Anti" struggle should be done well, and on the other hand, production should proceed as usual. Each inspection team studied the reporting materials according to the inspection households determined by the Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy, determined the focus of inspection, contacted the workers and shop assistants of the inspected households, understood the targets of struggle, divided the work, and formulated specific plans for inspection work. Many inspection teams also conducted "battle" exercises. For example, after studying the materials of the inspected households, the members of the 16th Inspection Team learned about and analyzed the situation of the targets of struggle through the shop assistants of the inspected households, determined the work steps, and corrected the shortcomings through struggle exercises, so that everyone received further practical education.

The inspection teams, which have been rigorously trained in this way, are not only skilled in fighting methods and have strict discipline, but also can specifically grasp policies and are very orderly, so that the inspection work can be carried out rapidly. On March 21, the Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy sent 74 inspection teams to conduct key experiments. By the 24th, thanks to the fact that the inspection teams grasped the policy of "relying on workers and shop assistants, striving for senior employees, neutralizing law-abiding households, and isolating illegal households," attached importance to family work, and repeatedly explained the policies to the capitalists, most of the illegal facts of the inspected households were found out within four days. Some illegal capitalists, under the call of the people's government's policies and the urging of workers and shop assistants, also voluntarily confessed their problems. The inspection team that inspected Huaxin Instrument Stationery Factory, due to doing a good job in the work of senior employees and mobilizing the capitalists with lighter violations to confess voluntarily, basically solved the case on the same day they entered the store. Each inspection team has mastered the policy of combining "Five-Anti" with production. In order to take care of production, the inspection team of Tianzhang Paper Mill held a general staff meeting on the 22nd (Saturday), the staff's holiday, and designated a capitalist to take care of regular business. A few technicians from Zhonghua Iron Factory participated in the "Five-Anti" movement, and immediately promoted some apprentices to replace the master workers to operate. The shop assistants of many stores also formed "Five-Anti" groups and business groups, participating in the "Five-Anti" work on the one hand and doing business on the other. Therefore, the inspected factories and stores have achieved normal production and business during the inspection process, and the order is orderly. Although Shanghai's "Five-Anti" struggle is still in its initial stage, this point is a prominent success.

Now, Shanghai's "Five-Anti" movement has officially begun, and on the basis of the experience already gained, it will inevitably achieve greater victories.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 25th: Shanghai's struggle against major embezzlers has achieved great victory. Now the struggle has entered a deeper and more detailed stage of drawing conclusions.

Shanghai's movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in agencies, since February 9, has entered the stage of concentrating fire against major embezzlers from the general confession and reporting. The struggle to encircle and suppress major embezzlers was divided into five battles and lasted for more than a month. At the beginning of this movement, some leading cadres had right-leaning thoughts, believing that there were no "tigers" in their agencies, and their understanding of the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie was insufficient, thus affecting the development of the movement. Around February 20, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China severely criticized and corrected this right-leaning thought, and separately dealt with a group of responsible cadres who had unclean hands and were not strong in leading the anti-corruption struggle. After that, the battle situation greatly changed, and all agencies achieved unprecedented victories. However, during this period, due to the urgency of the task and insufficient investigation and research to grasp the materials, some agencies also experienced the phenomenon of forcibly attacking and not paying attention to tactics. In order to solve this problem, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China repeatedly emphasized propaganda policies, emphasized investigation and research, and emphasized the "attacking the mind and fighting with intelligence" in tactics at the meeting of the "Tiger-Fighting" squadron leaders. According to this instruction of the Municipal Party Committee, each agency established political work, on the one hand, repeatedly explained the policies to the masses, and on the other hand, mobilized the masses to conduct extensive investigation and research work. After the movement corrected the right-leaning thought and overcame the tendency of forcibly attacking, it quickly entered a climax.

After five battles, all agencies universally mobilized the masses, improved the masses' class consciousness, drew a clear ideological line with the bourgeoisie, and purified the organization. The "insiders" installed by the bourgeoisie within the agencies fell into the net one after another, and stubborn major embezzlers and corrupt groups who had made "offensive and defensive alliances" were exposed by the masses in batches. For example, the nine state-owned specialized companies in Shanghai all turned out groups of "tigers." The Shanghai Municipal People's Bank captured Zhou Jianyun, a major embezzler who was a "insider" of the bourgeoisie and defrauded the state of 10 billion yuan in loans.

After the promulgation of the Central Commission for Thrift Inspection's Several Provisions on Handling Corruption and Waste and Overcoming Bureaucratic Errors, the movement has made further progress. The broad masses of agency staff took this document as a weapon and universally studied it. Several agencies also dealt with a group of corrupt elements in accordance with the spirit of the document. In many agencies, some "tigers" who had not been taken down for a long time voluntarily confessed and confessed after being educated by this document, and voluntarily returned the stolen goods.

Now, the Shanghai Municipal agencies are taking special handling methods for major embezzlers who still refuse to confess, continuing to collect materials, and striving to thoroughly solve the case; they are carrying out the work of clearing and recovering the stolen goods from major embezzlers who have been solved; and they are separately dealing with general small and medium-sized embezzlers.

    经过周密布置和充分准备
    上海反盗窃斗争正式开始
    大批检查队进入私营厂店检查违法工商户
    各机关反贪污斗争已胜利转入作结论阶段
    【新华社上海二十五日电】上海市反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的运动，经过充分的准备，在二十五日宣布正式开始。上海市增产节约委员会已派遣了大批“五反”工作检查队进入厂、店，彻底检查违法工商户的违法事实。
    上海市的“五反”运动是经过周密的布置和充分的准备才开始的。远在两个月以前，市增产节约委员会即一面号召人民群众检举工商户的违法事实，一面号召工商业户自动坦白。到二月底，增产节约委员会收到的检举材料和各地机关部队转来的材料达数十万件。为了有秩序地开展“五反”运动，增产节约委员会集中了大批的工作人员研究和整理材料，按照中央人民政府政务院公布的关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法以及上海工商户的违法事实，进行了周密的排队工作，确定百分之六十五左右的工商户为守法户和基本守法户，百分之三十左右为半守法半违法户，其余为严重违法和完全违法户，以便分别处理。同时，增产节约委员会组织和训练了参加“五反”运动的队伍，首先分区训练了一万多工人、店员，向他们进行阶级教育，说明开展“五反”运动的意义。到三月中旬，增产节约委员会又从各机关、部队抽调了大批干部，和经过训练的工人、店员以及一部分自外地来上海调查“三反”材料的干部组成“五反”工作检查队，向他们进行政策教育和纪律教育，强调“五反”运动必须结合生产，就是一面“五反”斗争要搞好，一面生产要照常进行。各检查队根据增产节约委员会确定的检查户研究了检举材料，确定检查重点，并和被检查户的工人、店员取得联系，了解斗争对象，进行分工，订出检查工作的具体计划。有许多检查队还进行了“战斗”演习。如第十六检查队的队员在研究被检查户的材料后，又通过被检查户的店员了解和分析斗争对象的情况，确定工作步骤，经过斗争演习纠正缺点，使大家进一步受到了实际教育。
    经过这样严格训练的检查队，不仅在斗争方法上操之有术，具有严格的纪律，而且能够具体掌握政策，极有秩序，使检查工作迅速开展。在三月二十一日，增产节约委员会曾派出七十四个检查队进行重点试验，到二十四日为止，由于各检查队掌握了“依靠工人、店员，争取高级职员，中立守法户，孤立违法户”的方针，重视了家属工作，并向资本家反复说明了政策，在四天之内，被检查户的违法事实大部分都已查出，一部分违法的资本家在人民政府的政策感召和工人、店员的促使下，也自动交代了问题。检查华新仪器文具厂的检查队由于做好了高级职员的工作，并动员了违法较轻的资方自动坦白，在进入该店的当天就基本上破案。各检查队都掌握了“五反”结合生产的政策。天章造纸厂的检查组为了照顾生产，到二十二日（星期六）职工假期才召开全体职工大会，并指定了一个资方照顾经常业务。中华铁工厂有少数技术工人参加“五反”运动，即提了一部分学徒去代替老师傅操作。许多商店的店员也组成为“五反”组和营业组，一面参加“五反”工作，一面营业。因此，被检查的工厂和商店在检查过程中都做到了照常生产和营业，秩序井然。上海的“五反”斗争虽然还在初期，但这一点是突出地成功的。
    现在，上海的“五反”运动正式开始了，在已经获得经验的基础上，必然会得到更大的胜利。
    【新华社上海二十五日电】上海市反对大贪污犯的斗争已获得巨大胜利。现在斗争已转入更深入更细致的作结论的阶段。
    上海市机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，自二月九日由普遍坦白检举进入集中火力反对大贪污犯。围剿大贪污犯的斗争分作五个战役进行，历时一个多月。这次运动开始时，某些领导干部曾存在右倾思想，认为自己的机关中没有“老虎”，对资产阶级的猖狂进攻认识不足，因而影响了运动的开展。中共上海市委员会在二月二十日左右严厉地批判和纠正了这种右倾思想，并分别处理了一批手面不干净和领导反贪污斗争不力的负责干部。此后，战局就大为改观，各机关都取得了空前的胜利。但这一时期，由于任务急迫，调查研究掌握材料不够，某些机关又发生了强打硬攻、不讲求战术的现象。为了解决这一问题，中共上海市委员会曾几次在“打虎”中队长会议上强调宣传政策，强调调查研究，强调战术上的“攻心斗智”。根据市委这一指示，各机关建立了政治工作，一方面反复向群众说明政策，一方面发动群众进行广泛的调查研究工作。运动在纠正了右倾思想并克服了强打硬攻的偏向后，便迅速进入高潮。
    经过五个战役，各机关普遍发动了群众，提高了群众的阶级觉悟，和资产阶级划清了思想界限，纯洁了组织。资产阶级安在机关内部的“坐探”纷纷落网，刁顽的大贪污犯、订有“攻守同盟”的贪污集团成批成批地被群众揭露出来。如上海九个国营专业公司都打出了成群结队的“老虎”。上海市人民银行擒获了资产阶级“坐探”、骗取国家贷款一百亿元的大贪污犯周剑云。
    中央节约检查委员会关于处理贪污、浪费及克服官僚主义错误的若干规定颁布后，运动又有了进一步的开展。广大机关工作人员把这一文件作为武器，普遍地进行了学习。若干机关并根据文件的精神处理了一批贪污分子。不少机关中有些久攻不下的“老虎”，在这一文件的教育下纷纷自动坦白交代，并自动退赃。
    现在，上海市各机关对至今仍拒不坦白的大贪污犯正采取专案专办的方法，继续搜集材料，务求彻底破案；对已破案的大贪污犯正进行清理追赃工作；对一般中小贪污犯正分别进行处理。
