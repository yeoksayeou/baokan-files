    Learning from the Sisters Flying in the Sky
    Comrade Editor: I once went to an airport in a certain place to welcome our female pilots and their planes to Beijing to celebrate "March 8th" International Women's Day.

    At the airport in a certain place, I stood with many female comrades. Our eyes were constantly looking at the sky, we longed to see the people we admired—the female pilots and their planes arriving. "Here they come!" a little sister shouted. Sure enough, they came, one, two..., flying very steadily. The planes piloted by female comrades were flying freely in the skies of the motherland.

    The female pilots came down from the planes. They were smiling with rosy faces, they were really strong. We warmly shook hands and embraced the female pilots. This was the first time in Chinese history. Commander Liu said: "Female comrades can also fly into the sky, this is Chairman Mao's teaching."

    I asked myself: Can I do more for the people? Whenever I think of the sisters flying in the sky, I have confidence: Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, as long as we are willing to work hard, we can learn anything.

    Today, on "March 8th" International Women's Day, let us pay tribute to the sisters flying in the sky and learn from them! Lü Zhiying

    向在天空飞着的姊妹们学习
    编辑同志：我曾经到某地机场迎接我们的女飞行员和她们的飞机来北京过“三八”节。
    在某地机场上，我和好多女同志站在一起。我们的眼睛不断地瞅着天空，我们渴望看见我们所羡慕的人——女飞行员和她们的飞机到来。“来啦！”一个小妹妹喊。果然来了，一架、两架………，飞得很稳。女同志驾驶的飞机在祖国天空中自由地飞翔着。
    女飞行员从飞机中下来了。她们满面红光地笑着，她们可真强壮。我们和女飞行员热烈地握手、拥抱。这是中国历史上的第一次。刘司令员说：“女同志也能飞上天，这是毛主席教导的。”
    我问我自己：能不能为人民多做点事呢？每当我想到在天空飞的姊妹们时，我就有了信心：在毛主席的教导下，只要肯努力，什么都能学会。
    “三八”节的今天，让我们向在天空飞的姊妹们致敬，向她们学习！  旅之鹰
