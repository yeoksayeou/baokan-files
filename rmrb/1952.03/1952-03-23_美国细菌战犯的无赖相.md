    The American aggressors are gambling on the Korean battlefield and are clearly doomed to lose. Whether on land, at sea, or in the sky, they have been beaten black and blue. Now, the American war criminals are resorting to filthy bacteria, attempting to rely on bacteria to salvage their inevitable defeat. But this scandalous act is shameful and has been met with strong opposition, hatred, and contempt from people all over the world. At this time, American imperialism has once again resorted to its heinous rogue tactics – "denying the debt."

    Since January 28th, after the "United Nations Command" ordered its air force to spread bacteria in Korea and China, the Associated Press, United Press, International News Service, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse, whose profession is to spread rumors, put on a nauseating "gentlemanly" demeanor and said nonchalantly: "North Korea may indeed have an epidemic"; "The Communist army is incapable of dealing with internal infectious diseases." As if the matter really had nothing to do with the American aggressors. The cunning Reuters reporter ingeniously asked the "United Nations" field commander to help him find a basis: "Only the most complete sanitary equipment can prevent diseases among the troops while they are holding still." The American aggressors' guilt was lightly attributed to "holding still." Unfortunately, although these dispatches were prepared in advance, they forgot to exchange opinions with each other. Therefore, the dispatches they sent slapped each other in the face. The Associated Press from Tokyo wrote: "North Koreans are really suffering from plague, cholera, and other infectious diseases"; while the International News Service quoted "an official in charge of the Eighth Army" as saying: "There is no indication of a large-scale epidemic occurring in the territories controlled by the Communist army." Naturally, their dispatches also had a common characteristic, that is, they all tried to prove that the American air force did not spread bacteria.

    Ridgway thought that he could get away with it by letting those news agencies deny it, so he "has not made any comment." However, too many bacteria were spread, and the whole world roared in anger. Ridgway finally reversed his usual "calm" and made a hasty statement that was "completely, absolutely, and clearly a fabrication." Immediately afterwards, Secretary of State Acheson also hurriedly shouted: "The United Nations forces have not conducted and are not conducting any kind of bacteriological warfare."

    Just as Ridgway and Acheson were shouting with a straight face, some "disappointing" American pilots mistakenly spread bacterial insects on the American positions. These insects carrying bacteria have never existed in Korea or China, so it is naturally impossible to say that they were spread by the Chinese and Korean air forces or came out of the snow. The United Press reporter could not explain this incident, so he said nonsensically: "Allied troops found many flies and fleas on the mountainsides on their own side," "but the Allies did not accuse them of being dropped by the Communists." So, who dropped them? The reporter did not say, and he could not say.

    Another "unfortunate" thing is that some American soldiers were captured by the Chinese and Korean People's Forces after being injected with eight kinds of vaccines, such as plague and yellow fever. These prisoners did not know or were unwilling to keep secrets for the American aggressors. They confessed all the truth and had "vaccination certificates" as proof. Why did the U.S. military want to prevent this kind of plague in Korea, where there has never been plague and yellow fever in history? And why didn't they get injections last year, but suddenly thought of getting injections this year? Ridgway will probably declare again that this is "completely, absolutely, and clearly a fabrication."

    This set of rogue tricks by the American aggressors is nothing new. People clearly remember that before the American aggressors launched the war of aggression against Korea, they had secretly transported a large number of warships, weapons, and advisers to Taiwan. However, Acheson, at a press conference on June 23, 1950, announced with a straight face: "We will neither provide military assistance to Taiwan nor send advisers." Only four days later, on June 27, President Truman publicly declared that he had ordered the Seventh Fleet to occupy Taiwan. The American aggressor army repeatedly raided the Kaesong neutral zone last year and repeatedly bombed Kaesong. But Ridgway at that time also stubbornly denied it. He said that the American aggressor army "did not and could not destroy the Kaesong neutral zone." After American planes bombed General Nam Il's residence, U.S. representative Colonel Kinney also denied it, saying: "This was not an American plane." He even suggested that it was the Chinese and Korean planes that bombed their own chief representative. After our representatives tore off their rogue faces step by step, Ridgway finally had to make a confession of "feeling double regret" in an ugly manner.

    Today, Acheson and Ridgway have brought out their rogue tactics again. But this time it is even less effective. People all over the world are angrily demanding severe punishment for the American bacteriological warfare criminals. What to do if they can't deny it? Acheson put on an insidious and cunning face again, demanding an investigation by the International Committee of the Red Cross. But this cannot deceive anyone. Who doesn't know that the main members of the International Committee of the Red Cross are just a group of lackeys raised by the American aggressors? Who would believe that they can do something beneficial to mankind! They can only faithfully carry out the orders of the American aggressors. In fact, "investigation" is not a new trick. People still remember the situation of Colonel Kinney's "investigation" of the American plane bombing Kaesong on August 22 last year. He stood next to the new crater blown open by American bombs, pointed to the American shrapnel, and said roguelike: "This was not bombed, and this is not American shrapnel." Later, when Colonel Kinney saw the evidence that could no longer be denied, he was unwilling to "investigate" any more, and said repeatedly: "Okay, okay, let's go!" The American war criminals are now going to order the International Committee of the Red Cross to "investigate." They probably want to stage such an ugly scene again!

    American war criminals, no matter how you deny it, you cannot deny what you have spread on the ground. Put away that vile and rogue method.

    美国细菌战犯的无赖相
    陈迹
    美国侵略者在朝鲜战场进行赌博，显然是输定了。无论在陆上、海上或天空，都被打得焦头烂额了。现在，美国战犯们乞灵于腌脏的细菌，企图依靠细菌来挽救他们已经无法挽救的失败。但这种丑事是见不得人的，它遭到了全世界人民的强烈反对和仇视，鄙视。这时，美帝国主义就又使出了它的穷凶极恶的流氓手段——“赖账”。
    从一月二十八日起，“联合国军司令部”命令它的空军向朝鲜、中国撒布细菌以后，以造谣为专职的美联社、合众社、美国国际新闻社和路透社、法新社，装出令人发呕的“绅士”风度，满不在乎地说：“北朝鲜可能已经真正有瘟疫流行”；“共军无能对付内部传染病”。似乎事情真的与美国侵略者无关的样子。刁猾的路透社记者别出心裁地请“联合国军”战地指挥官帮助他找了一个根据：“只有最完善的卫生设备，才能使军队在按兵不动期间不生疾病。”把美国侵略者的罪责轻轻地推给了“按兵不动”。可惜这些电稿事先虽有准备，但却忘记了互相交换意见。因此他们发出来的电稿就相互打了嘴巴。美联社从东京发出的电讯写道：“北朝鲜人真的患鼠疫、霍乱等传染病”；而美国国际新闻社却引用“第八军的一位负责官员”的话说：“现在没有迹象证明共军控制的领地中发生大规模的瘟疫”。自然，它们的电稿也有一个共同的特点，那就是都企图证明美国空军并没有撒布细菌。
    李奇微以为让那些通讯社赖一下就赖过去了，所以他“一直没有发表任何评论”。但是，细菌撒得太多了，全世界都怒吼起来了。李奇微终于一反历来的“冷静”，来了个“完全、绝对、明明白白是虚构之言”的慌张声明。紧接着，国务卿艾奇逊也急忙嚷道：“联合国军过去未进行、现在也未进行任何种细菌战”。
    正当李奇微、艾奇逊一本正经地喊叫的时候，偏偏那些“不争气”的美国飞行员，又把细菌毒虫误撒到美军的阵地上了。这些夹带细菌的虫子在朝鲜或中国地面上都从来不曾有过，想说成是中朝空军撒的或是雪里钻出来的，自然都不行。合众社记者无法解释这一事件，只好没头没脑地说：“联军部队在他们自己这一边的山边发现了许多苍蝇和跳蚤”，“但是联军并没有指责他们说是共军丢下的”。那么，是谁丢下的呢？这位记者没有说，他也不能说。
    另外一件“不幸”的事情，就是有一些美国士兵，偏偏在注射了鼠疫、黄热病等八种疫苗之后，被中朝人民部队俘掳了。这些俘虏不知道、也不愿意为美国侵略者保守秘密，他们把一切真相都供认了，而且有“预防注射证”为证。在历史上从来没有过鼠疫和黄热病的朝鲜，美军为什么要预防这种瘟疫呢？而且为什么去年不注射，今年就忽然想到要注射呢？李奇微这次大概又要声明说这是“完全、绝对、明明白白是虚构之言”了。
    美国侵略者的这套无赖的把戏，并不是什么新奇的花样。人们清楚地记得，美国侵略者发动侵略朝鲜战争之前，就已经偷偷地把大批军舰、武器和顾问运送到我国台湾了。但是艾奇逊在一九五○年六月二十三日的记者招待会上，还板着面孔宣布：“我们对台湾……既不加以军事援助，也不派顾问。”仅仅隔了四天，到六月二十七日，杜鲁门总统就公开声明他已命令第七舰队占领台湾了。美国侵略军在去年曾多次偷袭开城中立区，曾一再轰炸开城。但当时的李奇微也是死不认账。他说，美国侵略军“没有、而且也不可能破坏开城中立地区”。在美国飞机轰炸南日将军住所之后，美国代表肯尼上校也曾抵赖说：“这不是美国方面的飞机”。甚至还暗示这是朝中方面的飞机自己轰炸自己的首席代表。当我方代表一步一步地撕破了他们无赖的脸孔之后，李奇微终于不得不丑态百出地发表一个“感到双重遗憾”的供词。
    今天，艾奇逊、李奇微又把他们的无赖手段拿了出来。不过这一次更不灵了。全世界人民都在愤怒地要求严惩美国细菌战犯。赖不掉，怎么办？艾奇逊又装出一副阴险狡诈的面孔，要求由红十字国际委员会进行调查。但这是骗不了人的。谁不知道红十字国际委员会的主要委员们只是美国侵略者豢养的一批奴才？谁还会相信他们能做出点有益于人类的事来！他们只能忠实执行美国侵略者的命令。其实，“调查”也并不是什么新奇的花样。人们都还记得那个肯尼上校去年八月二十二日到开城“调查”美机轰炸开城事件的情形。他站在被美国炸弹炸开的新弹坑旁边，指着美国的弹片，无赖地说：“这不是炸弹炸的，这也不是美国的弹片。”后来这位肯尼上校看到了再也不能抵赖的证据时，他就不愿再“调查”了，连说：“好了，好了，我们走吧！”美国战犯们现在又要命令红十字国际委员会“调查”，大概他们又想演这样一幕丑剧了！
    美国战犯们，不管你们怎样抵赖，你们撒在地上的东西是赖不掉的。把那套流氓无赖的卑贱手段收起吧。
