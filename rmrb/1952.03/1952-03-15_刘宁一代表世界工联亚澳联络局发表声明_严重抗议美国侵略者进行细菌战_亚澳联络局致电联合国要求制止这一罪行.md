Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: Liu Ningyi, on March 14th, on behalf of the World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau, issued a statement strongly protesting the heinous crime of bacteriological warfare committed by the American aggressors. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Having suffered disastrous defeats on the Korean battlefield, the American aggressors, in their desperation, have recently escalated their inhumane bacteriological warfare on a massive scale! Since January 28th, the American forces invading Korea have continuously used large numbers of military aircraft to scatter insects and poisons containing plague, cholera, typhoid, and other infectious bacteria over Korea and Northeast China. They have also fired bacteriological shells and dropped bacteriological bombs on the front lines of Ma Liang Mountain in Korea. These bloodthirsty American bandits are now widely using various bacteriological weapons, employing barbarous and unscrupulous means to massacre the Korean and Chinese people! This heinous crime, which violates humanitarian principles and international law, is a grave threat to the peace and security of all mankind and a complete destruction of human civilization and justice!

All reliable materials prove that the American aggressors' manufacturing and use of bacteriological weapons has been a long-planned affair. As early as 1943, the American government invested huge sums of money in this evil undertaking, establishing a large-scale base for preparing bacteriological warfare at Fort Detrick in Maryland. Later, bacteriological warfare experiment centers were established in Mississippi, Utah, and Indiana. After the Second World War, the United States' work on manufacturing bacteriological weapons continued to expand. At the end of 1946, a military observer for the New York Times revealed that "under the overall leadership of the Army Chemical Warfare Service, experiments are continuing on the manufacture of several kinds of deadly poisons." Former U.S. Army Chemical Warfare Service Chief, Mr. Waitt, boasted in early 1949 that the United States had left other countries "in the dust" in the research of bacteriological warfare weapons. In March 1951, Dr. Parran, Director of the U.S. Public Health Service, openly declared that "microbial shells and bombs" had become immediately feasible weapons. Soon after, the American "Life" magazine shamelessly boasted that the U.S. Army Chemical Corps' Bacteriological Warfare Department had invented sixteen kinds of bacteriological weapons sufficient to kill large numbers of people. Moreover, former U.S. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal openly incited war in many speeches, advocating the use of all weapons, including atomic bombs and bacteriological weapons. These are the shameless confessions of the criminals.

These American man-eating beasts prepared and carried out bacteriological warfare in long-term collusion with the sworn enemies of the Korean and Chinese people, the universally hated Japanese bacteriological war criminals Shiro Ishii, Ryoichi Naito, and Masajo Kitano. These criminals, whom the Soviet government requested to be tried by an international special military tribunal in its February 1, 1950 memorandum, are now continuing their murderous activities under the protection of the American bandits. The notorious MacArthur had long ago organized a bacteriological warfare research institute in Tokyo, headed by Shiro Ishii. Not long ago, these three notorious Japanese bacteriological war criminals were dispatched to Korea by order of Ridgway's headquarters to conduct bacteriological experiments and were responsible for submitting plans for conducting bacteriological warfare in winter.

The American aggressors have long been conducting bacteriological weapon experiments in a barbaric manner, massacring captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. In March 1951, Bacteriological Landing Craft No. 1091, under the command of Sims, director of the "Health and Welfare Department" of the U.S. invasion army headquarters, secretly sailed to Wonsan Port in North Korea to conduct experiments with bacteriological weapons on captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers; then it sailed to Geoje Island, where a large number of captured personnel of the Korean People's Army were imprisoned, to conduct experiments with the lives of prisoners of war. Moreover, as early as the winter of 1950, when the American invading forces withdrew from northern Korea, they scattered smallpox bacteria in the areas they had occupied; as a result, in these areas where smallpox had not been discovered for several years, an outbreak of smallpox suddenly occurred shortly after liberation, and hundreds and thousands of peaceful residents were poisoned by the bandits.

The bloody crimes committed by the American aggressors in the Korean War are already too numerous to count. And now these beasts, devoid of humanity, are intensifying their efforts and openly using destructive bacteriological weapons on a large scale, in an attempt to kill the peaceful residents of entire countries. Can anyone who loves peace, possesses reason, and has human compassion not be filled with righteous indignation?!

The angry protests and unanimous condemnation of the people of the world have frightened the American aggressors, who have a guilty conscience. They have adopted their usual clumsy trick of sophistry and lies, shamelessly denying the facts of the bacteriological warfare they are conducting, attempting to evade responsibility for this crime. From the "responsible officials" of the U.S. Eighth Army to Acheson, statements of denial have been issued, saying that the "United Nations forces" did not conduct bacteriological warfare; but they have not said a word about the series of bloody crimes of the American aggressors' long-term planning and preparation for bacteriological warfare, which are known to the world. The report from Kaesong by the "Ce Soir" journalist, Béchet, further revealed the details of Ridgway's bacteriological warfare in Korea. He interviewed a Chinese People's Volunteer fifteen kilometers northwest of Cheorwon, who personally witnessed three American aircraft circling low in the sky about ten kilometers north of the demarcation line at 1:00 p.m. on February 11, scattering a cloud of black mist. About an hour later, piles of flies and fleas were found scattered on the snow on the hillside; there were more than a thousand fleas in one square meter. Local residents testified that flies had not appeared in this area until the end of March at the earliest. A patrol team of the Volunteers discovered that the American troops in this area had suddenly withdrawn from the front line on the evening of the 10th, apparently to protect the American troops from the effects of Ridgway's bacteriological warfare. The tens of millions of people in Korea and Northeast China will provide countless conclusive evidences of the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare. The unsubstantiated denials of the Acheson clique are clearly acts of self-deception and cannot deceive anyone.

People remember vividly that after the Korean armistice negotiations began last year, the American aggressors repeatedly sent aircraft to intrude into the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone to carry out bombing and strafing in order to sabotage the negotiations. The American side repeatedly denied that these crimes were committed by them. But the iron facts finally forced them to admit their provocative acts. Such examples are too numerous to mention.

The people of the world have long seen through that reckless denial of facts and spreading rumors and slander are consistent tricks of the American aggressors and their government officials. Their heinous crime of conducting large-scale bacteriological warfare in a planned and prepared manner, completely violating humanitarian principles and destroying international law, is irrefutable with ironclad evidence.

The American aggressors' bloodstained and brutal crimes more thoroughly prove that they are the mortal enemies of all peace-loving people, the mortal enemies of the justice and security of all mankind, and especially the mortal enemies of the people of our Eastern nations!

We, on behalf of millions of workers in Asia and Australia, solemnly protest the heinous crimes of the American army fighting in Korea under the name of the United Nations!

We call on the workers of Asia and Australia and all upright and kind people to unanimously condemn and immediately stop the shameless barbaric atrocities of the American aggressors; to safeguard justice and humanity, to protect human civilization and security, and to resolutely and effectively crush all the evil war plans of the American aggressors. The heinous bacteriological war criminals must be severely sanctioned by human justice!

Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: The World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau sent a telegram on March 14th to United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie and Security Council President Garreau protesting the crime of the American forces invading Korea using bacteriological weapons and demanding that the United Nations immediately stop the American aggressors' evil act of using bacteriological weapons. The telegram is as follows: Lake Success, United Nations, Mr. Secretary-General Trygve Lie and forwarded to Mr. President Garreau of the Security Council:

Since January 28th, the American army fighting in Korea under the name of the United Nations has continuously scattered poisonous insects and germs on a large scale in Korea and Northeast China. The American government's collusion with Japanese bacteriological war criminals in long-term conspiracies for bacteriological warfare preparations and intentions is known to the world. This crime, which violates humanitarian principles and destroys international law, is not only a brutal massacre of the Korean and Chinese people but also a serious threat to world peace and human security. This atrocity has aroused unanimous anger and condemnation from the Korean and Chinese people and righteous condemnation from world opinion.

The World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau, like all just humanity in the world, cannot sit idly by and watch the mad criminals create human disasters and massively massacre peaceful humanity with their heinous crimes!

The World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau, on behalf of millions of workers in Asia and Australia, lodges a serious protest against the crime of the American army conducting bacteriological warfare and demands that the United Nations immediately stop the evil act of the American aggressors using bacteriological weapons.

    严重抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战
    亚澳联络局致电联合国要求制止这一罪行
    【新华社十四日讯】刘宁一十四日代表世界工联亚澳联络局发表声明，严重抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行。声明全文如下：
    在朝鲜战场上遭受到惨重失败的美国侵略者，最近更穷凶极恶不顾一切地、大规模地进行灭绝人性的细菌战了！一月二十八日以来，侵朝美军接连不断地以大批军用飞机在朝鲜和在中国东北地区，大量地撒布各种含有鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒及其他传染病菌的昆虫和毒物，更在朝鲜马良山前线发射细菌炮弹，投掷细菌炸弹，嗜杀成性的美国强盗们，已在广泛使用各种细菌武器、野蛮残暴不择手段地在虐杀朝、中人民了！这种违反人道、破坏国际公法的滔天罪行，是对全人类和平、安全的严重威胁，是对于人类文明与正义的彻底破坏！
    一切可靠的材料证明：美国侵略者制造使用细菌武器是蓄谋已久的事了。早在一九四三年美国政府就用巨款投入了这一罪恶的事业，在马里兰州的狄特里克营建立了规模巨大的准备细菌战的基地。以后又在密士失必州、犹他州、印第安纳州建立了细菌战实验中心。二次世界大战结束后，美国制造细菌武器的工作是更日益扩展着。一九四六年底，纽约时报军事观察家曾透露：“在陆军军事化学部的总领导下，正继续制造若干种致命毒物的试验”。前美国陆军军事化学部部长怀特在一九四九年初曾吹嘘说：美国在研究细菌战争武器方面，已使其他国家“望尘莫及”。一九五一年三月，美国卫生研究院院长海斯公然宣称：“微生物的炮弹和炸弹”已成为立即可能实现的武器。不久美国“生活”杂志更无耻的夸耀说：美国陆军化学兵团的细菌作战部已发明了足以大批杀人的十六种细菌武器。而美国前国防部长詹森更在许多次演说中公开地煽动战争，主张使用一切武器包括原子弹与细菌武器。这就是罪犯们的无耻自供。
    这些美国吃人野兽准备和进行细菌战争，是和朝、中人民不共戴天的仇敌、万人憎恨的日本细菌战犯石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏等长期合谋的。一九五○年二月一日苏联政府照会提出要组织国际特别军事法庭加以审判的这些罪犯，现在又在美国强盗卵翼之下继续从事其杀人的勾当。臭名昭彰的麦克阿瑟，早就以石井四郎为首在东京组织了细菌战研究所。不久以前这三个著名日本细菌战犯奉李奇微总部之命，派赴朝鲜进行细菌试验，且担负着提出关于冬天进行细菌战争的计划的任务。
    美国侵略者早已野蛮透顶地用细菌武器实验在屠杀朝、中人民军队的被俘人员。一九五一年三月美国侵略军总部“卫生福利处”处长赛姆斯所指挥下的第一○九一号细菌登陆艇曾秘密开到北朝鲜的元山港，用中国人民志愿军被俘人员作细菌武器的实验；然后又开赴囚禁着大批朝鲜人民军被俘人员的巨济岛，用战俘的生命进行试验。且早在一九五○年冬天当美国侵略军从朝鲜北部撤退时，就在他们曾经占领过的地区撒布了天花细菌；因而在这些几年以来未发现过天花的地区，解放不久突然发现了天花传染病，成百成千的和平居民，遭受到强盗们的毒害。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜战争中所造下的血腥罪恶，早已屈指难数了。而这些丧失了人性的野兽，现在更变本加厉地公然大规模使用毁灭性的细菌武器，以图杀害整个国家的和平居民。任何爱好和平有理性和人类同情心的人，能不为此而义愤填胸吗？！
    全世界人民的愤怒抗议和一致声讨，吓慌了那些做贼胆虚的美国侵略者；他们采取了惯用的狡赖撒谎的拙劣伎俩，无耻地矢口否认他们所进行的细菌战的事实，企图推卸对这种罪行应负的责任。从美国第八军的“负责官员”到艾奇逊都发出了抵赖的声明，说“联合国军”未进行细菌战；但对举世皆知的美国侵略者长期计划、准备进行细菌战的一连串血腥罪迹，他们却都只字不提。而巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌自开城的报道，却更进一步表明了李奇微在朝鲜进行细菌战的详情。他访问了铁原西北十五公里处的一位中国人民志愿军，后者在二月十一日下午一时亲眼看到三架美机在分界线北约十公里处低空盘旋，撒下一阵黑雾似的东西，大约一小时后就发现山坡的积雪上散布着一堆堆的苍蝇和跳蚤；一个地方一平方公尺面积内就有一千多个跳蚤。当地居民证明这一带出现苍蝇最早要在三月底以后。志愿军的巡逻队发现了这地区的美军在十日晚上突然撤离了前线，显然这是为了使美军免受李奇微细菌战的影响。朝鲜和中国东北地区的千万人民，都会提供美国侵略者进行细菌战的无数确凿罪证。艾奇逊之流的没有任何论据的矢口抵赖显然是掩耳盗铃之术，欺骗不了任何人的。
    人们的记忆犹新：去年朝鲜停战谈判开始以后，美国侵略者为了破坏谈判，曾多次派飞机侵入开城中立区上空进行轰炸扫射。美国方面曾经再三否认这些罪行是他们干的。但铁的事实终于迫使他们不得不对自己的挑衅行为加以承认。这样的事例是不胜枚举的。
    全世界人民都早已看透了：不顾事实地矢口狡赖和造谣污蔑，是美国侵略者及其政府官员的一贯伎俩。他们彻底违反人道、破坏国际公法，有计划、有准备地进行大规模细菌战的滔天罪行，是铁证如山无法抵赖的。
    美国侵略者血债累累的残暴罪行，更加彻底地证明了他们是一切和平人民的死敌，是全人类正义与安全的死敌，尤其是我们东方各民族人民的死敌！
    我们代表亚洲澳洲千百万工人，严正抗议以联合国名义在朝鲜作战的美国军队的滔天罪行！
    我们号召亚洲澳洲的工人和一切正直良善的人民一致声讨，并立即制止美国侵略者无耻的野蛮暴行；为维护正义人道，为保卫人类的文明与安全，以坚决有效的行动来粉碎美国侵略者的一切罪恶战争计划。万恶的细菌战犯，一定要受到人类正义的严厉制裁！
    【新华社十四日讯】世界工联亚澳联络局十四日致电联合国秘书长赖伊和安全理事会主席巴鲁赛克，抗议侵朝美军使用细菌武器的罪行，并要求联合国立即制止美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪恶行为。电文如下：美国成功湖联合国秘书长赖伊先生并转安全理事会主席巴鲁赛克先生：
    以联合国名义在朝鲜作战的美国军队，自一月二十八日以来，接连不断地在朝鲜和在中国东北地区，大量地散布毒虫病菌。美国政府勾结日本细菌战犯长期合谋进行细菌战争的准备和意图是举世周知的。这种违反人道、破坏国际公法的罪行，不仅是对于朝、中人民的残暴虐杀，而且是对于世界和平人类安全的严重威胁。这种暴行已经引起了朝、中人民的一致愤怒声讨和全世界舆论的正义斥责。
    世界工联亚澳联络局和世界正义人类一样决不能坐视丧心病狂的罪犯们制造人类灾患、大规模地杀害和平人类的滔天罪行！
    世界工联亚澳联络局代表亚洲、澳洲千百万工人，特对美国军队进行细菌战的罪行提出严重的抗议，并要求联合国立即制止美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪恶行为。
    世界工联亚澳联络局
    一九五二年三月十四日
