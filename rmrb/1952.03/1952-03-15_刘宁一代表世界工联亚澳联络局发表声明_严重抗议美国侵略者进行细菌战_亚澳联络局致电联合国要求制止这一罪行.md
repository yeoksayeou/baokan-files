Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: Liu Ningyi, on March 14th, on behalf of the World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau, issued a statement strongly protesting the heinous crime of bacteriological warfare committed by the American aggressors. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Having suffered disastrous defeats on the Korean battlefield, the American aggressors, in their desperation, have recently escalated their inhumane bacteriological warfare on a massive scale! Since January 28th, the American forces invading Korea have continuously used large numbers of military aircraft to scatter insects and poisons containing plague, cholera, typhoid, and other infectious bacteria over Korea and Northeast China. They have also fired bacteriological shells and dropped bacteriological bombs on the front lines of Ma Liang Mountain in Korea. These bloodthirsty American bandits are now widely using various bacteriological weapons, employing barbarous and unscrupulous means to massacre the Korean and Chinese people! This heinous crime, which violates humanitarian principles and international law, is a grave threat to the peace and security of all mankind and a complete destruction of human civilization and justice!

All reliable materials prove that the American aggressors' manufacturing and use of bacteriological weapons has been a long-planned affair. As early as 1943, the American government invested huge sums of money in this evil undertaking, establishing a large-scale base for preparing bacteriological warfare at Fort Detrick in Maryland. Later, bacteriological warfare experiment centers were established in Mississippi, Utah, and Indiana. After the Second World War, the United States' work on manufacturing bacteriological weapons continued to expand. At the end of 1946, a military observer for the New York Times revealed that "under the overall leadership of the Army Chemical Warfare Service, experiments are continuing on the manufacture of several kinds of deadly poisons." Former U.S. Army Chemical Warfare Service Chief, Mr. Waitt, boasted in early 1949 that the United States had left other countries "in the dust" in the research of bacteriological warfare weapons. In March 1951, Dr. Parran, Director of the U.S. Public Health Service, openly declared that "microbial shells and bombs" had become immediately feasible weapons. Soon after, the American "Life" magazine shamelessly boasted that the U.S. Army Chemical Corps' Bacteriological Warfare Department had invented sixteen kinds of bacteriological weapons sufficient to kill large numbers of people. Moreover, former U.S. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal openly incited war in many speeches, advocating the use of all weapons, including atomic bombs and bacteriological weapons. These are the shameless confessions of the criminals.

These American man-eating beasts prepared and carried out bacteriological warfare in long-term collusion with the sworn enemies of the Korean and Chinese people, the universally hated Japanese bacteriological war criminals Shiro Ishii, Ryoichi Naito, and Masajo Kitano. These criminals, whom the Soviet government requested to be tried by an international special military tribunal in its February 1, 1950 memorandum, are now continuing their murderous activities under the protection of the American bandits. The notorious MacArthur had long ago organized a bacteriological warfare research institute in Tokyo, headed by Shiro Ishii. Not long ago, these three notorious Japanese bacteriological war criminals were dispatched to Korea by order of Ridgway's headquarters to conduct bacteriological experiments and were responsible for submitting plans for conducting bacteriological warfare in winter.

The American aggressors have long been conducting bacteriological weapon experiments in a barbaric manner, massacring captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. In March 1951, Bacteriological Landing Craft No. 1091, under the command of Sims, director of the "Health and Welfare Department" of the U.S. invasion army headquarters, secretly sailed to Wonsan Port in North Korea to conduct experiments with bacteriological weapons on captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers; then it sailed to Geoje Island, where a large number of captured personnel of the Korean People's Army were imprisoned, to conduct experiments with the lives of prisoners of war. Moreover, as early as the winter of 1950, when the American invading forces withdrew from northern Korea, they scattered smallpox bacteria in the areas they had occupied; as a result, in these areas where smallpox had not been discovered for several years, an outbreak of smallpox suddenly occurred shortly after liberation, and hundreds and thousands of peaceful residents were poisoned by the bandits.

The bloody crimes committed by the American aggressors in the Korean War are already too numerous to count. And now these beasts, devoid of humanity, are intensifying their efforts and openly using destructive bacteriological weapons on a large scale, in an attempt to kill the peaceful residents of entire countries. Can anyone who loves peace, possesses reason, and has human compassion not be filled with righteous indignation?!

The angry protests and unanimous condemnation of the people of the world have frightened the American aggressors, who have a guilty conscience. They have adopted their usual clumsy trick of sophistry and lies, shamelessly denying the facts of the bacteriological warfare they are conducting, attempting to evade responsibility for this crime. From the "responsible officials" of the U.S. Eighth Army to Acheson, statements of denial have been issued, saying that the "United Nations forces" did not conduct bacteriological warfare; but they have not said a word about the series of bloody crimes of the American aggressors' long-term planning and preparation for bacteriological warfare, which are known to the world. The report from Kaesong by the "Ce Soir" journalist, BÃ©chet, further revealed the details of Ridgway's bacteriological warfare in Korea. He interviewed a Chinese People's Volunteer fifteen kilometers northwest of Cheorwon, who personally witnessed three American aircraft circling low in the sky about ten kilometers north of the demarcation line at 1:00 p.m. on February 11, scattering a cloud of black mist. About an hour later, piles of flies and fleas were found scattered on the snow on the hillside; there were more than a thousand fleas in one square meter. Local residents testified that flies had not appeared in this area until the end of March at the earliest. A patrol team of the Volunteers discovered that the American troops in this area had suddenly withdrawn from the front line on the evening of the 10th, apparently to protect the American troops from the effects of Ridgway's bacteriological warfare. The tens of millions of people in Korea and Northeast China will provide countless conclusive evidences of the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare. The unsubstantiated denials of the Acheson clique are clearly acts of self-deception and cannot deceive anyone.

People remember vividly that after the Korean armistice negotiations began last year, the American aggressors repeatedly sent aircraft to intrude into the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone to carry out bombing and strafing in order to sabotage the negotiations. The American side repeatedly denied that these crimes were committed by them. But the iron facts finally forced them to admit their provocative acts. Such examples are too numerous to mention.

The people of the world have long seen through that reckless denial of facts and spreading rumors and slander are consistent tricks of the American aggressors and their government officials. Their heinous crime of conducting large-scale bacteriological warfare in a planned and prepared manner, completely violating humanitarian principles and destroying international law, is irrefutable with ironclad evidence.

The American aggressors' bloodstained and brutal crimes more thoroughly prove that they are the mortal enemies of all peace-loving people, the mortal enemies of the justice and security of all mankind, and especially the mortal enemies of the people of our Eastern nations!

We, on behalf of millions of workers in Asia and Australia, solemnly protest the heinous crimes of the American army fighting in Korea under the name of the United Nations!

We call on the workers of Asia and Australia and all upright and kind people to unanimously condemn and immediately stop the shameless barbaric atrocities of the American aggressors; to safeguard justice and humanity, to protect human civilization and security, and to resolutely and effectively crush all the evil war plans of the American aggressors. The heinous bacteriological war criminals must be severely sanctioned by human justice!

Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: The World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau sent a telegram on March 14th to United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie and Security Council President Garreau protesting the crime of the American forces invading Korea using bacteriological weapons and demanding that the United Nations immediately stop the American aggressors' evil act of using bacteriological weapons. The telegram is as follows: Lake Success, United Nations, Mr. Secretary-General Trygve Lie and forwarded to Mr. President Garreau of the Security Council:

Since January 28th, the American army fighting in Korea under the name of the United Nations has continuously scattered poisonous insects and germs on a large scale in Korea and Northeast China. The American government's collusion with Japanese bacteriological war criminals in long-term conspiracies for bacteriological warfare preparations and intentions is known to the world. This crime, which violates humanitarian principles and destroys international law, is not only a brutal massacre of the Korean and Chinese people but also a serious threat to world peace and human security. This atrocity has aroused unanimous anger and condemnation from the Korean and Chinese people and righteous condemnation from world opinion.

The World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau, like all just humanity in the world, cannot sit idly by and watch the mad criminals create human disasters and massively massacre peaceful humanity with their heinous crimes!

The World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau, on behalf of millions of workers in Asia and Australia, lodges a serious protest against the crime of the American army conducting bacteriological warfare and demands that the United Nations immediately stop the evil act of the American aggressors using bacteriological weapons.
