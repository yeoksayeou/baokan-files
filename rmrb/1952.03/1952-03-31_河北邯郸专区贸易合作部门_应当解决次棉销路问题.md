    The Trade and Cooperation Departments of Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province
    Should Solve the Problem of Secondary Cotton Sales

    To the Editor: The Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company and cooperatives of Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, have demonstrated a bureaucratic attitude towards supporting production and disaster relief. In the cotton-producing areas of Linqing, Guantao and other counties under the jurisdiction of this prefecture, cotton production and quality were affected last year due to a series of disasters such as spring drought, insect pests, and early frost. Judging from the recent cotton market situation in Linqing, frost-damaged cotton accounts for more than 70% of the total cotton on the market, and half of it has no textile value. Therefore, cotton farmers in the area are experiencing hardship this spring. However, the local Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company and cooperatives are not taking the initiative to solve the problem of the sale of substandard frost-damaged cotton. They refuse to purchase it because this cotton has no textile value, without trying to find ways to open up sales channels. As a result, the lives of cotton farmers are greatly threatened, and the masses are reacting very negatively.

### 河北邯郸专区贸易合作部门  应当解决次棉销路问题

    河北邯郸专区贸易合作部门
    应当解决次棉销路问题
    编辑同志：河北省邯郸专区花纱布公司和合作社，对扶植生产和救灾工作表现了官僚主义态度。这个专区所属临清、馆陶等县产棉区，去年因受一连串的春旱、虫害、早霜等灾害侵袭，棉花的产量品质都受到影响。从最近临清镇的棉花上市情况来看，霜黄花约占上市棉花总数的百分之七十以上，而其中有一半已经没有纺织价值。因此，今春该地棉农生活感到困难。但是，当地花纱布公司、合作社，却不主动负责解决次下级霜黄花的出路问题，他们竟因这些棉花没有纺织价值，就不去设法打开销路，拒绝收购，以致棉农生活大受威胁，群众反应极坏。
