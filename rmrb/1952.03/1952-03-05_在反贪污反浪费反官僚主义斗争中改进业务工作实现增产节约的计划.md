The First Mine Employees of the Datong Mining Bureau Set a New Coal Mining Record in the Anti-Corruption Struggle

The employees of the First Mine of the Datong Mining Bureau have greatly enhanced their class consciousness in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and have achieved great victories on both the anti-corruption front and the production front.

After overcoming right-leaning thoughts, the leading cadres of this mine improved the command, cleared out impure elements, absorbed miners to participate in leadership, and promoted the most outstanding members from workers and their families to form four strong "Tiger Hunting Teams." The "Tiger Hunting Teams" united more than 1,500 employees and family members of the entire mine, and cracked two corruption groups in the Manager's Section and the Cooperative.

While fighting corruption, the Party, Administration, Trade Union, and Communist Youth League assigned dedicated personnel to lead production, using various methods to strengthen class education for employees. Employees and their families put forward a resounding slogan: "Go down the well to produce more, catch 'tigers' above the well, and strive to be a model mine." Employees both above and below ground took up the challenge and made mutual guarantees: to be models on the production front and heroes in catching "tigers" on the anti-corruption front. The Ri Xishuan and Du Shifa group in the 873 recovery area improved labor organization, and the coordination of transportation and recovery was good. Under the difficult conditions of much gangue, production increased linearly. Now, each shift produces more than 330 carts of coal, an increase of more than 60% compared to past production. Each recovery area saves one coal cutter per shift. The mine's overall production has also increased compared to before the campaign, and on February 15, a new record of 1,078 tons of coal was created. (Zhang Yi)

Cadres Divided Labor to Lead "Tiger Hunting" and Production, Beipiao Mining Bureau Exceeds Production Targets

Since the launch of the anti-corruption movement, the production of the Beipiao Mining Bureau has not only been unaffected, but has also made good achievements. In January, in addition to exceeding the production target five days ahead of schedule, major injury accidents were also eliminated. Although the production target for February was increased compared to the previous month, as of the 22nd, it still exceeded the cumulative daily production target. The main reason for the achievements is that the leadership clearly divided labor in this movement and kept a close watch on production, reviewing production reports daily. If it was found that a certain pithead had not completed its task for the day, the deputy director would personally go to the site to inspect and supervise the next morning, and help solve problems in a timely manner. Workers have raised their class consciousness in this movement. Many workers are doing the work of two or three people. They said, "After digging out the corrupt elements this time, the cost can be greatly reduced, and our lives and welfare will be improved."

Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau Vehicle Section Employees Complete February Production Task Ahead of Schedule

The employees of the Tianjin Vehicle Section of the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau raised their class consciousness in the anti-corruption movement, overfulfilled the February production task two days ahead of schedule, and eliminated overtime work; the quality of vehicle repairs was also significantly improved, and no traffic liability accidents occurred throughout the month.

The employees of the Tianjin Vehicle Section cracked a major smuggling and drug trafficking case headed by the major corrupt official Han Baoqi in the anti-corruption struggle. Many workers were educated in this struggle and understood the necessity of unity and overcame departmentalism. For example, if the wheel group had few people, the auxiliary repair group workers would help after finishing their work. The reason why they can do a good job in production is also because the leading cadres have a clear division of labor and grasp production tightly; Section Chief Zhang Tongfa is in charge of production, and Deputy Section Chief Hai Feng leads the anti-corruption movement. On February 5, they held a factory management committee meeting, correctly assessed the fact that the workers' class consciousness had been raised, and decided to implement the Soviet advanced experience - the "serpentine operation method" and Bai Xiaosheng's "circulating assembly line operation method," and formulated the production plan for the freight repair plant and the repair and parts plant. Due to the implementation of the production plan, the freight repair plant completely eliminated overtime; the workers in the repair and parts plant knew what work they had to do every day, and the work was also organized. In addition, the technical personnel of the vehicle section established a system of special responsibility, clarified the division of labor, went deep into the site, helped production groups implement various new working methods, and established new systems. They helped the freight repair plant establish a "foreman's noon reporting system," so they could grasp the morning production situation in order to plan and allocate labor and materials, so the phenomenon of unplanned chaos no longer occurred.

The Fifth Factory of the Northeast Electrical Industry Bureau Holds a Short-term Training Class for Materials Personnel

The materials and business departments are the places where corrupt elements are most hidden. In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the Fifth Factory of the Northeast Electrical Industry Bureau, in order to ensure the timely supply of raw materials, transferred twenty-four technically skilled workers and staff members with correct work styles and open minds from various workshops to form a short-term training class, and conducted business education on material storage, procurement, transportation, and sales, as well as necessary policy education, according to production needs. After short-term training, the problem of a lack of cadres in the materials and business departments can be basically solved. (Dong)

China Grain Company Guangdong Provincial Company Completes Tasks Such as Transfer and Procurement in the Movement

The spring grain transfer work in Guangdong Province is extremely heavy. Whether this task can be completed is related to the lives of millions of farmers in grain-deficient areas. The Guangdong Provincial Grain Company of the China Grain Company has grasped this main business: in terms of procurement, it completed 117% of the original plan in January and 132% of the original plan in February; in terms of sales, it completed 96% of the plan in January and 104% of the plan in February. In terms of transfer, it completed 91% of the plan in January; in February, except for the Gaolei, Hainan, and Chaoshan areas, other areas basically completed their tasks. At the same time, the work of investigating major corrupt officials has also made significant achievements.

The company was able to complete its main business in the anti-corruption movement due to the following methods: First, appropriately adjust various work systems to adapt to the heavy combat tasks. For example, the past departmental office system was changed to a joint office system, saving manpower and time spent on official documents. Major work tasks are flexibly concentrated to be completed in a blitz. Second, staff members with corrupt behavior were replaced, and the workforce was reduced, affecting business. The company promptly filled the vacancies in the main business departments with staff from secondary business departments; boldly promoted active and pure cadres; and promptly dealt with minor corrupt elements whose circumstances were lighter and who could thoroughly confess, requiring them to redeem their crimes in their work posts. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members played a leading role, improving work enthusiasm and strengthening work efficiency to make up for the lack of manpower. Third, while ensuring the completion of the main business, the anti-corruption struggle against field personnel was not relaxed. The company adopted a method of combining rotational transfer back to the agency for investigation and universal filling in of forms to confess, to examine them. And combined external materials to track down and verify. Those with serious circumstances were immediately transferred back to the agency for thorough investigation.

Supply and Marketing Cooperatives at All Levels in Central South China Corrected the Stagnation of Fertilizer Supply Work

After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the leadership of the cooperatives at all levels in the Central South China region once caused the fertilizer supply work to stagnate. For example, the Hunan Provincial Cooperative Bureau had long kept all the fertilizer supply funds in the bank and had not released them; the cooperatives in Ganzhou Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, transferred 1.1 billion yuan for other purposes after receiving 1.7 billion yuan in fertilizer supply funds from the higher-level cooperatives, affecting the fertilizer loan work; the Henan Provincial Cooperative acquired fertilizer raw materials but did not immediately process them. The Central South Cooperative Administration has now transferred cadres to be specifically responsible for guiding the fertilizer supply work. As of early February, the various fertilizers acquired by the cooperatives in the Central South China region (excluding Guangxi) have reached more than two-thirds of the original acquisition plan. The Henan Provincial Cooperative also mobilized its members to store physical objects, thus mastering a large number of fertilizer raw materials and overcoming the difficulty of insufficient cooperative funds.

The Anhui South Cleaning Assets and Verifying Funds Committee Grabs Business Work Tightly in the Anti-Corruption Struggle

The Anhui South Region Cleaning Assets and Verifying Funds Committee draws time and manpower in the anti-corruption struggle to grasp the progress of business work. On the one hand, they seize the time to review the asset cleaning and valuation forms of various enterprises, and on the other hand, they send personnel to some enterprises where the asset cleaning and valuation work is progressing relatively slowly to help the work, so that this work will not be suspended due to the anti-corruption struggle; and make the progress of this work in various enterprises can generally reach consistency, which will facilitate the unified deployment of the next step of work after the end of the movement. In addition, the Anhui South Cleaning Assets and Verifying Funds Committee takes the initiative to provide assistance to those enterprises that have replaced the personnel responsible for the asset cleaning and verification work. In addition to regularly sending people to the enterprises to assist in the work, the committee also leaves dedicated personnel in the committee every day to help various enterprises solve difficulties and answer questions in the work at any time.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争中改进业务工作实现增产节约的计划
    大同矿务局第一矿职工在反贪污斗争中创采煤新纪录
    大同矿务局所属第一矿职工，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中，阶级觉悟大大提高，在反贪污战线和生产战线上都获得很大胜利。
    这个矿的领导干部克服了右倾思想后，健全了指挥部，清除了不纯的成份，吸收了矿工参加领导，从职工和家属中提拔出最优秀的分子，组成了四个坚强的“打虎队”。“打虎队”团结了全矿一千五百多名职工和家属，攻破了经理科、合作社两个贪污集团。
    在反贪污斗争的同时，党、行政、工会、青年团有专人领导生产，运用各种办法对职工加强了阶级教育。职工和家属们，提出了响亮的口号：“下井多生产，上井捉‘老虎’，争取模范矿。”井上井下职工都挑了战，互相保证：在生产战线上当模范，在反贪污战线上当捉“虎”英雄。八七三回采区日喜拴、杜士发小组，改进了劳动组织，运搬和回采配合得好，在夹石多的困难条件下，生产量却直线上升。现在每班出三百三十多车煤，比过去的产量提高了百分之六十多。各回采区每班都节省下一名割煤机手。全矿的生产量也比运动以前提高了，二月十五日创造了日产一千零七十八吨煤的新纪录。 （张毅）
    干部分工领导“打虎”和生产北票矿务局超额完成生产任务
    反贪污运动开展以来，北票矿务局的生产不但未受到影响，且做出了良好的成绩。一月份除提前五天超额完成生产任务外，并消灭了重伤事故。二月份的生产任务虽然比上月增加了，但截至二十二日止仍超过了日的累计生产任务。能做出成绩的主要原因是在这次运动中领导方面明确分了工，对生产抓得很紧，逐日审阅生产表报，如发现有的坑口未完成当天任务时，第二天早晨副局长就亲自下现场去检查、督促，及时帮助解决问题。工人在这次运动中提高了阶级觉悟，很多工人一人兼干两三人的活，他们说：“这回把贪污分子挖出来后，成本可大大降低了，咱们的生活、福利也得到改善了。”

    天津铁路分局车辆段职工提前完成二月份生产任务
    天津铁路分局天津车辆段职工，在反贪污运动中提高了阶级觉悟，提前两天超额完成二月份生产任务，并消灭了加班加点的现象；修车质量也显著地提高了，全月没有发生一件行车责任事故。
    天津车辆段职工在反贪污斗争中破获了以大贪污犯韩宝琦为首的大走私运毒案。很多工人在这个斗争中，受到了教育，更懂得了团结的必要，克服了本位主义思想。如车轮组人少，辅修组工人做完工作，就帮着干。他们所以能做好生产工作，还因为领导干部明确分工，抓紧生产；段长张同发搞生产，副段长海峰领导反贪污运动。二月五日，他们召开了工厂管理委员会会议，正确地估计了职工阶级觉悟提高的事实，决定推行苏联先进经验——“蛇行作业法”和白晓生的“循环流水作业法”，订立了货修厂和修配厂的生产计划。由于贯彻了生产计划，货修厂根本消灭了加班加点的现象；修配厂工人知道每天要做什么工作，工作也有头绪了。此外车辆段的技术人员建立了专责制，明确分工，深入现场，帮助生产小组推行各种新的工作方法，建立新的制度。他们帮助货修厂建立“工长中午汇报制度”，因此就能掌握上午生产进行情况，以便有计划地调配劳动力和材料，因之，无计划的紊乱现象不再产生了。    （沈秉勋）
    东北电器工业管理局第五厂举办材料人员速成训练班
    材料和业务部门都是贪污分子隐藏最多的地方，东北电器工业管理局第五厂在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，为保证原材料的及时供应，从各车间中抽调了二十四名作风正派、思想开展的技术工人和职员成立了速成训练班，并按照生产需要，进行材料保管、采购、运输、推销等业务教育，以及必要的政策教育。经短期训练后，材料和业务部门的干部缺乏问题基本上就可以解决。    （东）
    中国粮食公司广东省公司在运动中完成调运收购等任务
    广东省春季粮食调拨工作是极为繁重的。这一任务能否完成，关系缺粮地区千百万农民的生活。中国粮食公司广东省粮食公司抓紧了这项主要业务：在收购方面，一月份完成原订计划百分之一百一十七，二月份完成原订计划百分之一百三十二；销售方面，一月份完成计划的百分之九十六，二月份完成了计划的百分之一百零四。在调拨方面，一月份完成了计划百分之九十一；二月份除了高雷、海南、潮汕三区外，其他各区都基本上完成了任务。同时，清查大贪污犯的工作也有显著的成绩。
    这个公司在反贪污运动中能够完成主要业务，是由于采取了如下方法：首先，适当调整各项工作制度，使它和繁重的战斗任务相适应。如把过去分科办公制度改为联合办公，节省了公文来往所耗费的人力和时间。较重大的工作任务便机动地集中人力突击完成。其次，有贪污行为的工作人员被撤换了，人力减少，影响业务，这个公司就及时把次要业务部门的工作人员接充主要业务部门的空缺；大胆提拔积极纯正的干部；及时处理情节较轻又能彻底坦白的小贪污分子，要他们在工作岗位上立功赎罪。共产党员和青年团员发挥带头作用，提高工作积极性，加强工作效率，以弥补人力的不足。第三，在保证主要业务完成的同时，不放松对外勤人员的反贪污斗争。这个公司采取轮调回机关清查和普遍填表坦白相结合的方法，对他们进行审查。并结合外线材料来追查核对。情节较重大的便立即调回机关彻底清查。

    中南区各级供销合作社纠正了供肥工作停顿现象
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开展后，中南区各级合作社领导方面曾一度使供肥工作停顿下来，例如湖南省合作局曾把全部供肥资金长期存在银行里，迟迟地没有发放下去；江西省赣州专区的合作社接到上级社十七亿元供肥资金后，竟以十一亿元移作别用，影响了肥贷工作；河南省合作社收购了肥料原料后，没有立即进行加工。中南合作管理局现在已经抽调干部专门负责指导供肥工作。到二月上旬为止，中南全区（除广西外）合作社收购的各种肥料，已达原订收购计划的三分之二以上。河南省合作社并发动社员储存实物，因而掌握了大批肥料原料，克服了合作社资金不足的困难。

    皖南清理资产核定资金委员会在反贪污斗争中抓紧业务工作
    皖南区清理资产核定资金委员会在反贪污斗争中抽出时间和人力，抓紧业务工作的进行。他们一面抓紧时间审核各企业单位的资产清理估价表，一面派出人员到部分清理资产核定资金工作进行得比较缓慢的企业单位去帮助工作，使这项工作不因反贪污斗争而陷于停顿；并使这项工作在各企业单位中的进度能大体达到一致，这样就便于在运动告一段落后，能统一布置下一步骤的工作。另外，皖南区清理资产核定资金委员会对那些已撤换了负责清理资产核定资金工作的人员的企业单位，主动给予帮助。这个委员会除了经常派人到企业单位协助工作外，每天并在委员会中留下专人，随时帮助各企业单位解决工作中的困难和解答工作中的疑问。
