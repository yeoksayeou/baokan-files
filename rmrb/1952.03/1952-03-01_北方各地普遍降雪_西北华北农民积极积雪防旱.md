Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: From February 23rd to 27th, snow fell in the Northwest, North China, and Northeast regions. This snowfall covered almost the entire Northwest, most of North China, and much of the Northeast. The snow was particularly heavy in the central Liao River Plain of Northeast China, southern North China, and the Guanzhong region of Shaanxi, which is very beneficial for drought prevention and spring plowing.

Currently, farmers in the Northwest and North China, under the call of the People's Government, are actively sweeping and accumulating snow. In Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, when heavy snow fell on the 14th, more than 800 county and district cadres went to the countryside, mobilizing more than 30,000 farmers and over 10,000 carts to sweep and transport snow. As of the 18th, more than 6,000 mu of dry land in Shijiazhuang Prefecture had been irrigated with melted snow water, with each mu receiving approximately 20 carts or 300 dan of accumulated snow. The leading organs of Hebei Province also called on all regions to vigorously organize farmers to roll and harrow the land while the snow melts, in order to preserve soil moisture and prevent drought. After the last snowfall, farmers in Yushe County, Shanxi Province, used accumulated snow on more than 9,800 mu of land within three days. Zhang Zhiquan, a labor model from Dazhai Village in Yushe County, led more than 40 farmers to transport snow to over 100 mu of land in two days, with the meltwater equivalent to four fingers of rain.

    北方各地普遍降雪
    西北华北农民积极积雪防旱
    【新华社二十八日讯】二月二十三日到二十七日，西北区、华北区和东北区都下了雪，这场雪几乎遍布西北全区、华北大部地区和东北大部地区。东北中部辽河平原、华北南部和陕西关中地区雪量较大，对防旱春耕工作有很大好处。
    现在，西北和华北的农民在人民政府的号召下，都在积极扫雪和积雪。河北省石家庄专区各县在十四日大雪时，就有八百多县干部和区干部下乡，发动了三万多农民、一万多辆大车扫雪、运雪。截至十八日石家庄专区已有六千多亩旱地得到雪水融灌，每亩地约得到积雪二十车或三百担。河北省领导机关并号召各地趁雪融化时，大力组织农民轧地、耙地，以求保墒防旱。山西省榆社县农民在上次雪后，在三天内用积雪上了九千八百多亩地。榆社县大寨村劳动模范张志全带领农民四十多人，两天内运雪上地一百多亩，溶水量合四指雨。
