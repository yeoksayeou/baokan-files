    Review of the Movie "Towards a New China"
    Yuan Shuibai
    "Towards a New China" (Directed by Hong Wutian, produced by Beijing Film Studio) depicts the life of steel engineer Chang Weiliang before and after liberation, reflecting how China's steel industry was driven to the brink under the rule of the reactionary government and the oppression of American imperialism. After liberation, due to the fundamental change in the nature of the state power and social economy, the same factory has returned from the control of bureaucratic capital to the hands of the people, becoming part of a vigorously developing socialist state-owned enterprise. It reflects the Party and the government's implementation of the policy of relying on workers and uniting technical personnel in enterprise management, guiding them to give play to their enthusiasm and creativity, so that the steel factories destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries and subjected to imperialist economic blockade could be quickly repaired and restored to production. At the same time, it also reflects how the old technical personnel, under the inspiration and help of the working class, initially changed their past ideological style of despising workers, despising labor, being divorced from reality, and holding purely technical viewpoints, began to understand the wisdom, qualities, and strength of the working class, moved closer to the Party, and were willing to work actively under the leadership of the working class to serve the cause of national construction. It should be said that the movie "Towards a New China" has its successful side in reflecting the above-mentioned real life, expressing the above-mentioned theme, and depicting the awakening and progress of engineer Chang Weiliang. Judging from the era reflected in the work (the main part of the film) – the few months after the liberation of a large city in 1949, from the takeover of the factory to the initial restoration of production – its partial achievements and educational significance should be affirmed; it is wrong to obliterate it with one stroke, even to fundamentally negate this film.
    "Towards a New China" points out a way out for the old technical personnel through some figurative portrayals of characters.
    The film begins by introducing Chang Weiliang as a technical expert with national self-esteem and patriotism (but his patriotism is supra-class, that is, bourgeois). He hopes that China will build its own industry and become prosperous and strong, "no longer subject to foreign bullying." After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he returned from abroad, thinking that he could devote himself to construction work from then on, but his illusions were immediately shattered by the Kuomintang bandits' expansion of the anti-people civil war. He wanted to make steel, but the Kuomintang bureaucrats preferred to order from the United States; he hoped there would be no war, but the factory general manager wanted him to sign an "anti-communist" declaration; he was eager to implement his factory reform plan, but the reality almost forced him to resign and teach; he cherished the machines, but the bandit army wanted to destroy them when they retreated, and even when he refused to point out the location of important machines, he was almost shot by the bandit army. Such was the fate of a technical expert with a career ambition under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. What about after liberation? Not only did he not have to worry about unemployment and changing careers, but he was also valued and loved by the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. The new China needed him, and his technology had a place to be used. He used to not believe that the Communist Party attached importance to industrial construction, but the facts have now changed his wrong views; he used to be depressed and indignant, but now he has changed to excitement and optimism; he told his wife "things are different now" and actively threw himself into the intense work, participating in the glorious construction of the motherland.
    Chang Weiliang's ability to give play to his work enthusiasm is inseparable from the Party's implementation of the policy of uniting technical personnel in industrial construction.
    The factory takeover personnel representing the Party retained the original factory director and Engineer Chang, allowing them to continue to hold important positions. In the work, they fully respected their opinions. He Jindong, the worker who was once fired by Engineer Chang and is now the leader of the work team, greeted Engineer Chang enthusiastically as soon as he saw him when he took over the factory. The military representative often cared for Engineer Chang, and went through Chang's brother-in-law, Xu Minhua, to help him, persuade him, explain why it is necessary to rely on the working class, encourage him to study politics, believe in the strength of the working class, and tell him that technical personnel are also part of the working class. When individual workers despised technology and showed a contemptuous attitude towards Engineer Chang at the meeting table, the military representative criticized the workers' mistakes afterwards, reiterating the Party's policy of uniting technical personnel and striving for their progress. During an enemy bombing, He Jindong even showed the working class's noble qualities of selflessness and self-sacrifice. He pounced on Engineer Chang to protect him, resulting in his own serious injuries. That scene in the hospital was handled quite movingly. When He Jindong woke up from his coma, he replied to Engineer Chang's gratitude: "You are a good engineer, you have contributed to our factory, you have contributed to our people, you are the wealth of our country, I want to protect you!" This scene specifically embodies one aspect of the policy of uniting technical personnel, and also vividly expresses the working class's spirit of being the master of the country, and expresses the thinking of the working class leadership.
    Engineer Chang gradually changed under the leadership and education of the Party and the working class, as well as the influence of real life itself.
    The film depicts that when workers were trial-producing electrodes, Engineer Chang despised the workers' creative ability, and he despised the workers for not understanding science and technology. Later, when he discovered that the workers had automatically come up with a way to improve coal burning, making the chimneys emit white smoke instead of black smoke, he realized that his past prejudice was problematic. When solving the problem of steel solidification, he was inspired by the workers' creative suggestions and came up with the method of steelmaking with oxygen. Therefore, he further recognized the wisdom of the working class, recognized his past mistakes of one-sidedly emphasizing technology, one-sidedly relying on book theories, being divorced from reality, etc.; recognized that scientific theory and technology must be combined with production practice, and showed in action that he had initially established a labor viewpoint and was able to go to the site to experience actual operations. These descriptions reflect real life to a certain extent, and point out the direction for experts and intellectuals to move forward, that is: intellectuals must combine with the working people in order to achieve something.
    But it must also be pointed out that the movie "Towards a New China" is insufficient in reflecting reality and portraying characters, and some parts are distorted; the policy thinking it expresses is one-sided; its depiction of the Party's leadership role is also flawed.
    The factory reform plan designed by Engineer Chang, which he brought back from abroad, is an important clue in the film. Its abandonment and approval for adoption after modification reflect the fundamental difference between the reactionary government and the People's Government in their treatment of industrial construction. The film is right on this point. But the author neglected the other side of the problem, he did not adequately understand, nor did he criticize the nature of the content of this plan. The author once explained that its content included items such as "implementing scientific management," "changing operating procedures," and "increasing production." Since this is a set of things that Engineer Chang brought back from studying in the United States, it must be designed according to the capitalist mode of industrial production. Those "scientific management" and the like cannot be methods of the bourgeoisie exploiting workers. Although the film mentions from the side that the plan later approved by the Party and the government is "completely different" from the original plan, this mention is very unclear, and the impression it gives the audience is very weak, as if the plan is still basically the same as before. How is this plan "completely different" from the original plan? What processes did it go through to produce it? It is very insufficient to explain it with just such a simple sentence. Because this plan occupies a very important position in the film, it becomes necessary to add appropriate figurative descriptions of the modification process of this plan in the plot and on the screen. The film should clearly point out that Engineer Chang's original plan was brought from capitalist America, and it will not work in the new China; the film should depict how Engineer Chang, under the education and help of the Party and the workers, realized this fact, changed his views, and then absorbed the workers' opinions and accepted the leadership of the Party, and only then completed the modification of this plan. Only through this kind of specific description can the audience clearly feel that this plan is already a new plan, and is "completely different" from the old plan in its fundamental nature. In real life, many facts have proved that the set of capitalist industrial construction plans put forward by engineers who were educated in British and American capitalism are not applicable to the state-owned industry of the new China. The plan implemented in our state-owned industry is formulated based on China's actual situation, absorbing Soviet experience, and combining the inventions and creations of workers. There was a shot in the film that showed Engineer Chang seeing an introduction about the Soviet steel industry in a Soviet magazine, which sparked his interest in Soviet experience. But this was only mentioned once, and this clue was not developed later. In the original film script, the author also described that Engineer Chang had absorbed Soviet experience in his work. He said: "Soviet comrades have helped us a lot," and therefore had infinite hope for the future of China's industrialization. In the original script, it was also described that Engineer Chang had listened to the workers' opinions during the trial production of electrodes. He said to the workers: "You put forward your opinions first, and let's discuss them together!" In another place in the original script, it was also explained that the plan he designed was "everyone's plan," and said: "My part in it is too small, the main thing is the workers." Unfortunately, these necessary descriptions were not retained in the current film. The lack of this kind of necessary description makes the film flawed in reflecting the factory reform plan, that is: it does not emphasize that our industrial construction must rely on the working class and must absorb advanced Soviet experience. This is the fundamental difference between our industrial construction and capitalist countries.
    Related to this, the necessary criticism of Engineer Chang's own bourgeois ideas is also lacking in the film. The most prominent is that his supra-class concept of the country has not been deeply criticized. The slogan he shouted after liberation, "We must defend our country," this country is the country of the people. The "country" he mentioned under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government (such as when he said: "I hate selfish people who have no concept of the country." And once he asked the workers to stop the strike, "to think of the country"), is a country ruled by imperialism and feudal forces. These two kinds of countries are fundamentally different, but in the film, it seems that for Engineer Chang, the two kinds of countries are the same, and he loves them equally. The film only criticized Engineer Chang's wrong supra-class concept of the country once, that is, when the workers went on strike before liberation, the workers retorted him: "What country or not?" "Whose country?" But in the second half of the film, it is no longer mentioned whether Engineer Chang has clearly recognized his own wrong thinking, and the film has not made any criticism of his bourgeois concept of the country through others. Has Engineer Chang established a correct new concept of the country? The film does not clearly answer. In the original film script, there were some explanations. After Engineer Chang heard He Jindong say in the hospital, "We are united together now, our goal is one: to do a good job in the factory and build a new China," he said with emotion: "Now I have found the country I want to love." Another time, he even painfully expressed a new understanding of the concept of the country. He said that in the past under the rule of the Kuomintang, "I thought I was the most patriotic... After liberation, I knew the Communist Party, and I realized my mistake.... The People's Republic of China is the motherland I want to love." And he regretted that he had been an "accomplice of the exploiting class" and a "national sinner" in the past. However, in the film, we cannot see these descriptions that more clearly indicate that his thinking has undergone a great change. (Of course, the film also has better parts than the original script.)
    This film's criticism of other aspects of Engineer Chang's bourgeois thinking is also insufficient. For example, his idea that science is divorced from politics, his "industrial salvation" argument, etc. From the perspective of expressing the Party's policy towards the old technical personnel, it exposes the defects of one-sidedly emphasizing unity and relaxing education and transformation. The ideological problems of the old technical personnel, the bourgeois engineers who returned from studying in capitalist countries, are by no means merely "purely technical viewpoints" and "views, ideas, and practices are not practical enough." Xu Minhua, the military representative of another factory, his brother-in-law, who is one of the Party's representatives, made a judgment on Engineer Chang - "just a bit of a bookworm" - is also incorrect and very insufficient. The film emphasizes Engineer Chang's side of "hoping that China will become rich and strong," while ignoring the serious criticism of his bourgeois thinking. Today, the harm of bourgeois thinking in industrial construction has been fully exposed. In such a film with the theme of ideological transformation of technical personnel, neglecting to portray the serious struggle between the working class ideology and the bourgeois ideology, focusing on expressing the unity of the bourgeois engineers, and not raising the important significance of ideological transformation to the principled height of Chairman Mao's instruction that "ideological transformation, first of all the ideological transformation of all kinds of intellectuals, is one of the important conditions for our country to thoroughly realize democratic reform in all aspects and gradually implement industrialization," will inevitably weaken the ideology of this film. It should be pointed out that the film does show the engineer's transformation and progress. The film shows how he actively works, shows his close relationship with the workers, calling each other "Old Chang" and "Old He," but these progress, these good results, lack sufficient convincing power because they do not deeply describe the process of ideological transformation that Engineer Chang has experienced with the help of the Party and the workers.
    The film over praises the engineer, especially in the final scene, where he becomes the "one red flower among the green leaves." In contrast, the film's criticism of the workers is a bit more. The ending scene is poorly written. There is also too much dancing, and the music is not good.
    Of course, the reality reflected in the film has its limitations of the times. At the time when the film was made (1950), the struggle between the working class ideology and the bourgeois ideology was not as sharp as it is today. However, this struggle, especially in state-owned enterprises, existed from the beginning. The author did not deeply explore the fundamental contradiction of class struggle in real life, but only superficially described the transformation of an engineer, and only limited to the superficial phenomenon. This created the fundamental shortcoming of the film "Towards a New China": the ambiguity of the class viewpoint. Therefore, its educational significance is also limited to a certain extent.
    The shortcomings of the film in expressing the Party's leadership, in addition to the above-mentioned one-sidedness in expressing the policy of uniting and transforming the old technical personnel, are also distorted in the depiction of the image of the factory military representative representing the Party's leadership. The military representative lacks typicality, appears weak and mediocre, lacks the due mature style and firm spirit, and appears particularly cowardly and incompetent in his attitude towards Engineer Chang, and is overly accommodating. This image damages the film's expression of the Party's leading role, and at the same time, to a certain extent, blurs the thinking of relying on the working class and the working class leading the old technical personnel.
    In the process of expressing Engineer Chang from modifying the plan to the plan being finally approved, the film does not point out that the Party has played any leading role. Although Engineer Chang finally said in his speech that the plan was "obtained through the efforts of all comrades in the factory," in the image, only he was seen making and modifying the plan alone, and it was not seen how the Party specifically led this work. This situation is not in line with the reality in the factory.
    I think these are the successful side of the film and its main shortcomings.
    Now, in many of our state-owned factories, the combination of the working masses and technical personnel has made great progress compared with the situation in the early days of the factory takeover shown in the film. It has become one of the important keys to the development of the increase production and practice economy movement. In our factories, there have appeared some new types of technical personnel who have undergone ideological transformation and wholeheartedly serve the new democratic country. They learn from the workers, mingle with the workers, and improve work methods in a practical and realistic manner, so that the production of state-owned factories is leaping forward. In artistic works, reflecting these new atmospheres and depicting successful models of combining labor and technology is of great educational significance. Our audience expects the literary and film circles to create satisfactory achievements in this area.

    评电影“走向新中国”
    袁水拍
    “走向新中国”（编导：洪吴天，北京电影制片厂出品）通过对炼钢工程师常为梁的解放前后生活的描写，反映了中国钢铁工业在反动政府统治下和美帝国主义压迫下，怎样走向绝境；在解放后，则由于国家政权和社会经济性质的根本改变，同一工厂已从官僚资本的控制下，回到了人民手中，成为蓬勃发展的社会主义性质的国营企业的一部分。它反映了党和政府在企业管理中，贯彻了依靠工人、团结技术人员的政策，引导他们发挥出积极性和创造性，使遭受国民党反动派破坏和帝国主义经济封锁的钢铁工厂得以迅速修复和恢复生产。同时，也反映了旧技术人员怎样在工人阶级的启发和帮助下，初步改变了过去轻视工人、轻视劳动、脱离实际的思想作风和单纯技术观点，开始理解工人阶级的智慧、品质和力量，向党靠拢，愿意在工人阶级的领导下积极工作，为祖国建设事业服务。应该说，电影“走向新中国”在反映上述的现实生活、表达上述的主题思想、描写工程师常为梁的觉悟和进步上，是有它的成功的一面的。从作品所反映的时代（影片的主要部分）——一九四九年某大城市解放后几个月，工厂从接管到初步恢复生产——来看，它的部分的成绩和教育意义是应该肯定的；一笔加以抹煞，以至根本否定这部片子，是不对的。
    “走向新中国”通过了对人物的一些形象化的刻划，给旧技术人员指出一条出路。
    影片一开始就介绍常为梁是一个具有民族自尊心和爱国心的（但他的这种爱国心是超阶级的、也即是资产阶级的）技术专家，他希望中国建立自己的工业，富强起来，“不再受外国人的气”。抗战胜利，他从国外回来，以为从此可以埋头建设工作，但蒋匪帮扩大进行反人民的内战，他的幻想立刻被无情地粉碎了。他想炼钢，蒋匪官僚却宁愿到美国去定货；他希望不要打仗，工厂总经理却要他在“反共”宣言上签字；他满心要实现他的工厂改革计划，可是现实情况却几乎要逼得他辞了职去教书；他爱惜机器，可是匪军撤退时竟要破坏它，甚至当他拒不指明重要机器所在地时，几乎被匪军枪杀。在国民党反动统治下，一个具有事业心的技术专家的遭遇是如此。解放以后是怎样呢？他非但不愁失业改行，而且受到了中国共产党和人民政府的重视和爱护。新中国需要他，他的技术有了用武之地。他过去曾经不相信共产党重视工业建设，现在的事实却使他改变了这种错误的看法；他过去曾经苦闷愤慨，现在已一变而为兴奋乐观；他向他妻子说出了“现在不同了”的话，积极地投身到紧张的工作中去，参加了祖国的光荣建设事业。
    常为梁之所以能够发挥他的工作的积极性，是和党在工业建设中执行团结技术人员的政策分不开的。
    代表党的工厂接管人员留用了原来的厂长和常工程师，让他们继续担任重要职务。在工作中，十分尊重他们的意见。曾经被常工程师所开除的工人、现为工作组组长的何金栋，在接管工厂时一见常工程师，就立刻热烈地招呼。军事代表经常关心常工程师，通过常的妻弟许敏华去帮助他、说服他，说明为什么要依靠工人阶级的道理，鼓励他学习政治，相信工人阶级的力量，并告诉他，技术人员也是工人阶级的一部分。当个别工人轻视技术，在会议桌上表现了轻视常工程师的态度时，军事代表即在事后批评了工人的错误，重申了党的团结技术人员、争取他们进步的政策。在一次敌机轰炸下，何金栋更表现了工人阶级大公无私的高贵品质和自我牺牲精神，他扑在常工程师身上掩护他，以致自己受了重伤。在医院里的那一场戏是处理得相当动人的。何金栋从昏迷中醒来，他回答常工程师对他所表示的感激道：“你是个好工程师，你对于我们的厂有贡献，你对于我们的人民有贡献，你是我们国家的财富，我要保护你！”这场戏具体地表现了团结技术人员政策的一个方面，也生动地表现了工人阶级的主人翁的气概，表现了工人阶级领导的思想。
    常工程师就在党和工人阶级的领导和教育下，以及现实生活本身的影响下，逐渐有所转变。
    影片描写了在工人试制电极时，常工程师是轻视工人的创造能力的，他轻视工人不懂科学技术。后来在发现工人已经自动想出改进烧煤的办法，使烟囱不冒黑烟而冒白烟时，他才认识了他过去的成见是有问题的。在解决钢水凝固的问题时，他更由于工人们的创造性的建议的启发，而想出了用氧气化钢的办法，因此，进一步地认识了工人阶级的智慧，认识了自己过去片面强调技术、片面依靠书本上的学理、脱离实际等等思想的错误；认识了科学理论和技术必须和生产实践相结合，并且在行动中表现了他已经初步建立起劳动观点，能够到现场中去体验实际的操作。这些描写，在一定程度上反映了现实生活，并向专家知识分子指出了他们前进的方向，就是：知识分子必须和劳动人民相结合，才能有所成就。
    但必须同时指出的是电影“走向新中国”在反映现实和刻划人物方面，是不够的，有些部分是有歪曲的；它所表现的政策思想是有片面性的；它对党的领导作用的描写也是有缺陷的。
    常工程师从国外带回来的、他所设计的一个工厂改革计划，是影片中的一个重要线索，它的被废弃和在修改后被批准采用，表现了反动政府和人民政府对待工业建设的根本不同之处。在这一点上，影片是对的。但作者忽视了问题的另一面，他没有足够地认识，也没有批判这个计划的内容的性质。作者曾经交代它的内容包括“实行科学管理”“改变操作过程”“增加产量”等项。既然这是常工程师到美国去留学所带回来的一套东西，它必然是按照资本主义工业生产方式来设计的。那些“科学管理”之类，不可能不是资产阶级剥削工人的方法。电影虽则从侧面交代了后来被党和政府批准的计划，已经和原来的计划“完全不同”，但这一交代很不清楚，给观众的印象十分淡薄，好像这个计划基本上还是从前的一个。这个计划和原来的计划究竟怎样“完全不同”呢？它经过了那些过程而产生的呢？仅仅用这样一句简单的话来交代，是十分不够的。由于这一计划在影片中所占的地位十分重要，因此在情节上、画面上对这计划的修改过程，加以适当的形象化的描写，就变得必要了。影片应该明确地指出常工程师的原来的计划是从资本主义的美国搬来的，在新中国是行不通的；影片应该描写常工程师在党和工人们的教育和帮助下，怎样认识了这一事实，改变了自己的观点，然后吸收了工人们的意见，接受了党的领导，才把这个计划修改完成。只有通过这一类的具体的描写，才能够使观众明确地感觉到这个计划已经是一个新的计划，已经在根本性质上和旧的计划“完全不同”。在现实生活中，许多事实证明了，过去受英美资本主义教育的工程师所拿出来的一套资本主义工业建设的计划是不适用于新中国国营工业的。在我们的国营工业中所实施的计划是根据中国实际情况，吸收苏联经验，结合了工人的发明创造，而制订的。影片中曾有一个镜头说明常工程师从苏联杂志上看到了关于苏联炼钢工业的介绍，而发生了对苏联经验的兴趣。可是仅仅这么提到一次，这一条线索以后再也没有发展。在原电影剧本中，作者还描写到常工程师在工作中曾经吸收苏联经验，他说：“苏联同志帮了我们很大的忙，”并因此对中国工业化的前途产生了无限希望。在原剧本中，也还描写了常工程师在试制电极过程中，曾经倾听工人意见，他向工人说：“你们先把意见提出来，咱们合计合计！”在原剧本的另一处，也还说明了他所设计的计划是
    “大家的计划”，并说：“其中我的部分太小了，主要的是工人。”很可惜，这些必要的描写都没有在现在的影片中保留下来。缺少了这一类的必要的描写，就使影片在反映工厂改革计划这一件事上，产生了缺陷，就是：没有强调指出，我们的工业建设必须依靠工人阶级，必须吸收苏联先进经验。这是我们的工业建设和资本主义国家根本不同的地方。
    与此相联系的是，对常工程师本身的资产阶级思想，在影片中也缺少必要的批判。最突出的是他的超阶级的国家观念没有受到深刻的批判。他在解放后所呼的口号“要保卫我们的国家”，这个国家是人民的国家。他在国民党反动政府统治下所提到的
    “国家”（如有一回他说：“我恨自私自利没有国家观念的人。”又有一回他要求工人停止罢工，“要为国家着想”），乃是帝国主义和封建势力所统治的国家。这两种国家是根本不同的，但在影片中，彷佛对于常工程师，两种国家都是一样，他同样地爱它。对常工程师这种错误的超阶级的国家观念，影片里只批评过一次，那就是在解放前工人罢工时，工人驳斥他说：“什么国家不国家？”“谁的国家？”但在影片的后面大半部中，再也没有提到常工程师是否已经清楚地认识自己的这一错误思想，影片也没有通过别人，对他的资产阶级的国家观念作过任何批判。常工程师有没有建立起正确的新的国家观念来呢？影片没有明确地解答。在原电影剧本中，倒有一些交代，常工程师在医院中听了何金栋所说的“我们现在是团结在一块儿了，我们的目标是一个：搞好工厂，建设一个新的中国”之后，他感动地说：“现在我找到了我要爱的国家。”另外一次，他更沉痛地表示对国家这一概念有了新的认识，他说，过去在国民党统治下，“以为自己是最爱国的………解放了，我认识了共产党，我才明白自己的错误。……中华人民共和国才是我要爱的祖国。”并且痛悔自己过去做了“剥削阶级的帮凶”和“国家罪人”。可是，在影片中，我们却看不到这些比较明确的表示他的思想有了极大转变的描写。（当然，影片也有比原剧本好的地方。）
    这部影片对常工程师的资产阶级思想的其他方面的批评也是不够的。例如他的科学脱离政治的思想，他的“工业救国”的论调等。从表现党对待旧技术人员的政策思想上来看，就暴露了片面强调团结，放松教育、改造的缺陷。旧技术人员，从资本主义国家留学回来的资产阶级工程师，其思想上的毛病决不仅仅是“单纯技术观点”和“看法，想法，做法都不够实际”之类。作为党的代表之一的他的妻弟，另一工厂的军事代表许敏华对常工程师所下的判断——“就是有些书呆子脾气”，也是不正确的，很不充分的。影片强调了常工程师的“希望中国富强”的一面，而忽略了对他的资产阶级思想进行严肃的批评。今天，工业建设中的资产阶级思想的危害性，已经充分地暴露出来了。在这样一部以技术人员思想改造为主题的影片中，忽略了刻划工人阶级思想和资产阶级思想的严重斗争，偏重于表现对资产阶级工程师的团结，而没有把思想改造的重要意义，提高到毛主席所指示的“思想改造，首先是各种知识分子的思想改造，是我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一”的原则性的高度上来处理，就不可避免地会减弱这部电影的思想性。应该指出，影片的确也表现了工程师的转变和进步，影片表现了他怎样积极地工作，表现了他和工人关系的密切，彼此以“老常”“老何”相称，但这些进步、这些好的结果，由于没有深刻描写常工程师在党和工人的帮助之下所经历的思想改造的过程，就缺乏足够的令人信服的力量了。
    影片过分地推崇了工程师，特别是在结束时的一场戏中，他更成为“万绿丛中一点红”，对比之下影片对工人方面的批评，就显得多了一些。这一场结束的戏写得很不好。跳舞也过多，所配的音乐也不好。
    当然，影片中所反映的现实有它的时代的限制，在影片摄制的时候（一九五零年），工人阶级思想对资产阶级思想的斗争还没有像今天这样尖锐，但这种斗争，特别在国营企业中，是一开始就存在的，作者没有深刻发掘现实生活中的阶级斗争的根本矛盾，而仅仅比较肤浅地描写了一个工程师的转变，仅仅局限于表面的现象，这就造成了影片“走向新中国”的根本缺点：阶级观点的模糊。从而，它的教育意义也有了一定的限制。
    影片在表现党的领导上的缺点，除了上面提到的，在表现执行团结改造旧技术人员的政策上有片面性外，就是在描写代表党的领导的工厂军事代表的形象上也有歪曲。军事代表缺乏典型性，显得软弱庸俗，缺乏应有的老练的作风和坚强的气魄，在对待常工程师的态度上，特别显得懦弱无能，过分迁就。这种形象损害了影片对党的领导作用的表现，同时，也使依靠工人阶级的思想、工人阶级领导旧技术人员的思想，发生了一定程度的模糊。
    在表现常工程师从修改计划到计划最后被批准的过程中，电影没有指出党曾经起过任何领导作用。虽然常工程师最后在演说中曾表示这计划是“由全厂同志的努力得来的”，在形象上却只看见计划是他一个人做出来和修改过的，并没有看见党怎样具体领导这个工作。这种情形，是和工厂中的现实情况不相符合的。
    影片的成功的一面和它的主要的缺点，我以为是这些。
    现在，在我们的许多国营工厂里，工人群众和技术人员的结合，比起影片中所表现的工厂接管初期的情形来，已经有了巨大的进步，它已经成为展开增产节约运动中的重要关键之一。在我们的工厂里，已经出现了一些经过了思想改造、全心全意为新民主主义国家服务的新型的技术人员，他们向工人学习，和工人打成一片，实事求是地改进工作方法，使国营工厂的生产事业飞跃地前进。在艺术作品中，反映这些新气象，描写劳动和技术相结合的、成功的典型，是有很大教育意义的。我们的观众期望着文艺、电影界在这一方面能够创造出圆满的成绩来。
