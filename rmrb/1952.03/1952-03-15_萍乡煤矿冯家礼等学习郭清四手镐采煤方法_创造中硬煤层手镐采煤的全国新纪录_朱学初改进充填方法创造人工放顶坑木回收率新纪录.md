Pingxiang Coal Mine's Wangjiayuan Mine workers Feng Jiali, Xiao Chengxiang, and Zhong Xinai learned and developed Guo Qing's four-hand pick coal mining method, creating a new national record for hand pick coal mining in medium-hard coal seams on February 5th. They mined 162 tons of coal in eight hours, averaging 54 tons per person. This record is eight times higher than Pingxiang Coal Mine's quota before February of this year, and 2.37 times higher than the new quota after February of this year.

Feng Jiali and others' new record, like Guo Qing's new record, was created under the strip-filling longwall mining method. However, the coal seam mined by Feng Jiali and others is harder than that mined by Guo Qing, making it more difficult. On that day, in addition to adopting Guo Qing's experience of extending the mining face of each coal miner from three meters to six or seven meters and implementing a division of labor between coal mining and pillar support, they also made certain improvements based on the characteristics of the medium-hard coal seam. Because the medium-hard coal seam provides greater support to the roof than the loose coal seam, they changed Guo Qing's method of pulling a groove in the middle of the coal seam at the working face to pulling a groove at the lower part near the floor. The height of the groove was changed from 40 cm to 60 cm. The depth of the groove was changed from 60 cm to 1.6 meters. In this way, after the coal miners finished pulling the groove and the pillar workers supported the shed, the entire hard coal seam at the working face was loosened under the pressure of the roof, greatly reducing the difficulty of mining. At the same time, pulling the groove near the floor saved the bottoming work (mining the coal seam below the groove) in Guo Qing's coal mining method, so the mining speed was also greatly improved. Also, because the depth of the groove increased by 1.66 times, the progress of each mining increased from 90 cm to 1.8 meters to 2 meters, so the number of groove pulling and shed support was reduced by half compared to before. This relatively increased the mining time. In order to ensure the safety of coal mining after the mining progress increased, they also improved the shed support method. In the past, the conical wooden pieces filled in the gaps between the shed crossbars and the roof were 40 cm apart. In order to strengthen the shed's support for the roof, they shortened the distance of each wooden cone to 20 cm. In this way, they did not have any accidents during the mining process.

Now, Feng Jiali and others have formulated a production increase and economy plan for February, March, and April of this year based on the experience of this new record, and are using this plan to challenge Guo Qing. Their working faces for these three months are all medium-hard coal seams. In these three months, in addition to completing the tasks according to the new quota, they will mine an additional 3,780 tons of coal, which can increase production and save the country's wealth equivalent to 200 tons of rice. They also guarantee that no accidents will occur. (Xinhua News Agency)

Pingxiang Coal Mine's Wangjiayuan Mine underground staff Zhu Xuechu improved the filling method, increasing the timber recovery rate in the mining area using the strip-filling longwall mining method from 50% to over 75%, with the highest reaching 95%, creating the highest national record for artificial roof caving and material extraction timber recovery rate. His improvement advanced the artificial roof caving and material extraction work method of Longhu Mine workers Liu Songqiao and He Jincheng a big step forward.

Using the methods of Liu Songqiao and He Jincheng, the timber outside the stone dikes can be extracted, while using Zhu Xuechu's method, the timber previously built into the middle of the stone dikes can also be extracted. Each shed is made of three timbers, shaped like "Π". In the past, because the stone dikes built by the filling workers were irregular, each stone dike exceeded the range of the shed, so when the stone dike was built, the timber was built inside. Zhu Xuechu's method is to limit each stone dike within each shed, leaving the timbers on the left and right sides outside; when the stone dike is built close to the roof, a gap is left near the horizontal timber, and then it is built upwards. In this way, after the stone dike is built, all three timbers of the entire shed frame that were previously built in the stone dike can be extracted.

The improvement of this filling method also greatly strengthened the roof management work. In the past, the stone dikes were built irregularly and not firmly, and the roof was actually supported by the sheds. Therefore, when the sheds were crushed by the roof, the stone dikes also collapsed. In this way, the safety of the recovery area was affected. After the above-mentioned improvement, the stone dikes are more stable, and the safety in the recovery area has been greatly improved. In the past, the timber outside the stone dike area was often crushed by the roof after the stone dike collapsed. After the filling method was improved, the number of timber crushed was greatly reduced. Therefore, in the past twenty days, their timber recovery rate has increased to 95% for several days.

Since the Pingxiang Coal Mine's Wangjiayuan Mine where Zhu Xuechu is located has promoted this method, the cost has been reduced by 7.6%, and there is a trend of continued decline in the future. Zhu Xuechu has already mobilized the filling team workers he leads to formulate a full-year production increase and economy plan for this year, and is using it to challenge Liu Songqiao, He Jincheng, and others. According to this plan, they will extract an additional 19,800 meters of timber for the country in eleven months this year.

    萍乡煤矿冯家礼等学习郭清四手镐采煤方法
    创造中硬煤层手镐采煤的全国新纪录
    朱学初改进充填方法创造人工放顶坑木回收率新纪录
    国营萍乡煤矿王家源矿场工人冯家礼、萧成祥、锺细乃学习和发展了郭清四的手镐采煤方法，在二月五日创造了在中硬煤层中手镐采煤的全国新纪录。他们八小时采煤一百六十二吨，平均每人采出五十四吨。这个纪录比萍乡煤矿今年二月前的定额高八倍，比今年二月后的新定额高二点三七倍。
    冯家礼等的新纪录和郭清四的新纪录一样，都是在带状充填长壁式采煤方法下创造的。但是，冯家礼等采掘的煤层比郭清四采掘的更硬，也就比较更为困难。当天，他们除采用郭清四的经验，把每个采煤工人的采掘面由三公尺拉长到六、七公尺，并实行采煤和支柱之间的分工外，又根据中硬煤层的特性，作了某些改进。因为中硬煤层支持顶板的力量比较松煤层大，他们就把郭清四在工作面煤层中部拉槽的办法改为在下部接近底板处拉槽。槽口高度由四十公分改为六十公分。槽口纵深由六十公分改为一点六公尺。这样，当采煤工人拉完槽口，支柱工人支好棚子后，整个工作面的硬煤层就都在顶板压力下压松了，所以采掘的困难就大大减少。同时他们在接近底板处拉槽，节省了郭清四采煤方法中的起底工作（采槽口以下的煤层），所以采掘速度也更加提高。又由于槽口纵深增加了一点六六倍，一次采掘的进度由从前的九十公分增加到一点八公尺到二公尺，所以拉槽、支棚的次数比以前减少一半。这样就相对地增加了采掘时间。他们为了确保采掘进度增加后采煤的安全，又改进了支棚办法。过去，棚架横木和顶板间空隙中所填锥形木片，每个相距四十公分，他们为了加强棚架对顶板的支持力量，把每个木锥的距离缩短为二十公分。这样他们在采掘过程中，就没有发生任何事故。
    现在冯家礼等已经根据这次新纪录的经验，制定了今年二、三、四月份的增产节约计划，并以此计划向郭清四应战。他们这三个月的工作面都是中硬煤层。他们在这三个月中，除按照新定额完成任务外，还要多采出三千七百八十吨煤，可为国家增产节约等于二百吨大米的财富。他们并保证不出任何事故。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
    国营萍乡煤矿王家源矿场井下职员朱学初改进了充填方法，使王家源矿场用带状充填长壁式采煤方法的采煤区的坑木回收率由百分之五十提高到百分之七十五以上，最高时达到了百分之九十五，创造了人工放顶抽料坑木回收率的全国最高纪录。他的这个改进把龙虎矿场工人刘松桥、何金城的人工放顶抽料工作方法向前推进了一大步。
    运用刘松桥和何金城的方法，可以把石垛以外的坑木抽出来，而用朱学初的方法，就可以把从前垒在石垛中间的坑木也抽出来。每架棚子都是用三根坑木做成的，形状如“Π”。过去因为充填工垒的石垛不规则，每个石垛都超出棚子的范围，所以石垛垒成时，坑木就被垒在里面了。朱学初的方法是把每个石垛都限制在每个棚子之内，让左右两边的坑木留在外面；当石垛垒到接近顶板时，在横坑木的附近留出一个空隙，再往上垒。就是这样，石垛垒成后，过去垒在石垛中的整个棚架的三根坑木都可以抽出来了。
    这个充填方法的改进，并使顶板管理工作大为加强。从前，石垛垒得不规则，也不牢固，顶板实际上是被棚子支持着的。所以当棚子被顶板压碎时，石垛也随着倒塌。这样，回采区的安全就受到影响。按照上述改进后，石垛牢固了，回采区内的安全就大为改进。过去石垛地带以外的坑木也常常在石垛倒塌后被顶板压碎，充填方法改进后，坑木被压碎的数目就大为减少。因此，二十多天来，有几天他们的坑木回收率曾提高到百分之九十五。
    朱学初所在的萍乡煤矿王家源矿场从推广这个方法以来，成本已经降低了百分之七点六，今后还有继续下降趋势。朱学初已经发动他所领导的充填组工人订出了今年全年增产节约计划，并用以向刘松桥、何金城等应战。根据这个计划，他们今年十一个月中将给国家多抽出一万九千八百公尺的坑木。
