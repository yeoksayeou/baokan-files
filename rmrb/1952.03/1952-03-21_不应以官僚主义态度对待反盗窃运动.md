    The Anti-Theft Movement Should Not Be Treated Bureaucratically

    To the Editor: I am a staff member of the Inspection Team of the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission. On March 13th, in order to understand the situation of an illegal paper company whose accounts had been frozen, I went to the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee through the introduction of the Beijing Municipal Savings Inspection Committee. The staff of the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee looked at the letter of introduction, stamped it with the "Frozen Accounts Team" seal, and told me: "The accounts are not here, you can go to the Jingdu Gongyi Bank to contact Director Wu." When I arrived at Jingdu Gongyi Bank, I told the comrade who accepted the letter of introduction what I wanted to know. That comrade wrote a note on the original letter and asked me to contact Comrade Yang Dianwen at the Xin Yi Cigarette Factory. After I found Comrade Yang Dianwen, he told me that this paper company was not within the scope of their management.

    We learned from existing materials that the accounts of this paper company were definitely frozen. Therefore, on March 14th, I went to the Beijing Municipal Savings Inspection Committee to ask about this matter and finally found out that the accounts of this paper company were still at the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee. I went to the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee again. A comrade who met with me said again: "I will introduce you to another place." I said: "No need to introduce me, the accounts are here with you. I just called from the Beijing Municipal Savings Inspection Committee and contacted a Comrade Han here." He said he would ask again. Finally, they took out the relevant accounts.

    From this incident, it can be seen that some staff members of the Beijing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee and Jingdu Gongyi Bank are quite irresponsible in their work. The accounts are clearly stored in their own offices, but they don't even know it. Such an undesirable thing actually happened in the great movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy; it is shocking. I hope the relevant leaders and comrades will carefully examine this matter.
                                                                                                                              Guo Zizhan

    不应以官僚主义态度对待反盗窃运动
    编辑同志：我是人民革命军事委员会总政治部宣传部检查小组的一个工作人员。三月十三日，我为了了解已被冻结账目的一家违法纸行的情况，经北京市节约检查委员会介绍，到北京市人民政府财政经济委员会。市财政经济委员会工作人员看了介绍信在信上加盖了“冻结组”的印章，告诉我说：“账不在这里，你可去京都公易行找武局长接洽”。我到了京都公易行，把想了解的情况，告诉给接受介绍信的同志。那位同志在原信上批了字，要我到信一烟厂找杨殿文同志接洽。我找到了杨殿文同志之后，他又告诉我，他们经管的范围内没有这家纸行。
    我们从已有的材料得知，这家纸行的账目肯定的是被冻结了。因此，三月十四日我又到北京市节约检查委员会去问这件事，终于查到了，这家纸行的账目仍然在北京市财政经济委员会。我再到市财政经济委员会去。会见我的一位同志又说：“我介绍你到另一个地方去。”我说：“不要介绍了，账在你们这里。刚才我在北京市节约检查委员会打电话和你们这里一位韩同志联络过了。”他说再问一问。最后，他们把有关的账目拿出来了。
    从这件事，可以说明北京市人民政府财政经济委员会、京都公易行的某些工作人员对工作是相当不负责任的。账目明明在自己机关内存放着，自己竟不知道。像这样不应该有的事，竟发生在反贪污、反盗窃的伟大运动中，是惊人的事。希望有关领导同志和工作同志们很好地检查。    郭子旃
