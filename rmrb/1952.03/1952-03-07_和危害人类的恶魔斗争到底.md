    Fight to the End Against the Demons Who Endanger Humanity
    Wu Youxun, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
    Despite the unanimous and angry protests of the Chinese and Korean people, and the just condemnation of fair-minded public opinion around the world, the American aggressors have continued to drop bacteriological bombs and large quantities of bacteria-carrying insects on the front lines and behind the lines in Korea from February 17th to February 25th, attempting to kill Chinese and Korean people's fighters and Korean peaceful residents on a large scale. The American imperialists' relentless conduct of this inhuman bacteriological warfare further exposes their hideous faces, determined to destroy humanity and international law. It further proves how the American warmongers use science as a tool for their war of aggression, and how they use science as a tool for their slaughter of humanity. The towering crimes they have committed not only prove that they are the deadly enemies of the Chinese and Korean people and all peace-loving people around the world, but also the heinous criminals against scientific culture.
    In order to promptly extinguish the poisonous flames of the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare, outstanding Chinese medical workers and biological science workers have gone to Korea to work, and more medical and health and biological science workers will continue to go there one after another in the future. This will surely provide effective assistance and great encouragement to the Chinese and Korean people's fighters and the Korean people who are fighting heroically, and will surely defeat the American imperialists engaged in bacteriological warfare, and give this group of demons who endanger humanity a severe punishment, until they withdraw their sinful bloody hands of spreading bacteria and are forced to accept a just peace.

    和危害人类的恶魔斗争到底
    中国科学院副院长  吴有训
    美国侵略者不顾中朝人民的一致愤怒抗议和全世界公正舆论的正义声讨，竟继续从二月十七日到二月二十五日在朝鲜前方和后方投掷细菌炸弹及大量细菌毒虫，企图大规模地杀害中朝人民战士及朝鲜和平居民。美帝国主义者这样不断地进行灭绝人性的细菌战争，进一步暴露了他们决心毁灭人道和国际公法的狰狞面目。更证明美国战争贩子们怎样利用科学为他们进行侵略战争的工具，怎样利用科学为他们进行惨杀人类的工具。他们所犯的滔天罪行，不但证明他们是中朝人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的死敌，更是科学文化的凶恶罪犯。
    为了及时扑灭美国侵略者细菌战的毒焰，中国优秀的医务工作者及生物科学工作者，已前往朝鲜进行工作，今后还将有更多的医药卫生及生物科学工作者，陆续前往。这必将给予英勇战斗中的中朝人民战士和朝鲜人民以有效援助和极大鼓舞，必能战胜从事细菌战的美帝国主义者，并给予这一群危害人类的恶魔以严厉的惩罚，直到他们缩回他们撒布细菌的罪恶血手，被迫接受一个公正的和平为止。
