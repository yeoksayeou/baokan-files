    The American aggressors, after suffering severe defeats in Korea, were forced to accept armistice negotiations, but deliberately delayed and refused to comply; at the same time, they recklessly colluded with Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals to launch bacteriological warfare, and this atrocity has expanded from the Korean front and rear to our Northeast region. This vicious, insane act, which violates human justice and is not permitted by international law, is a provocation to peace-loving people all over the world, and it will not escape the severe sanctions of human justice!
    The broad masses of the people of the motherland have been fully mobilized to protest against the towering crimes of the American aggressors, and unanimously support the two solemn statements made by Foreign Minister Zhou. Scientific workers across the country are transforming their anger into strength, and taking practical actions to crush the evil intentions of the common enemy of mankind, the American aggressors. Medical workers across the country must complete all necessary preparations and preventive measures in the shortest possible time to support the highly organized, militant, and experienced epidemic prevention personnel who are working in areas ravaged by American aggressors, as well as the troops and masses of China and Korea who love their motherland and love peace. Concentrate our efforts to continue to strengthen all aspects of the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and give the American aggressors another lesson.
    All teachers, students, and staff of the China Union Medical College are rising up together, responding to the call of the motherland, determined to contribute all our strength to completely crush the shameless conspiracy of the stubborn enemy, and we will never give up until the American imperialists bow their heads and confess their crimes!

    必须强迫美国侵略者认罪
    中国协和医学院院长  李宗恩
    美国侵略者在朝鲜受到严重的挫败后，被迫接受停战谈判，但又故意拖延不肯就范；同时不顾一切地勾结日本细菌战犯发动细菌战争，这种暴行已经从朝鲜前线和后方扩大到我国的东北地区了。这种毒辣的、疯狂的、违反人类正义的、为国际公法所不容许的罪恶行为是对全世界爱好和平的人民的挑衅，它决逃不脱人类正义的严厉制裁！
    祖国的广大人民群众已经全面动员起来，抗议美国侵略者的滔天罪行，一致拥护周外长的两次的严正声明。全国科学工作者化愤怒为力量，以实际行动来粉碎人类公敌美国侵略者的恶毒企图。全国医务工作者在最短期内，要完成一切必要的准备及预防措施，支持正在美国侵略者肆虐地区进行工作的有高度组织性、战斗性和富有经验的防疫工作人员及中朝两国热爱祖国热爱和平的部队、群众。集中力量，继续加强抗美援朝的各项工作，给美国侵略者再一次的教训。
    中国协和医学院全体师生员工一致奋起，响应祖国号召，决心贡献出一切力量，彻底粉碎顽敌的无耻阴谋，非到美帝国主义者低头认罪誓不罢休！
