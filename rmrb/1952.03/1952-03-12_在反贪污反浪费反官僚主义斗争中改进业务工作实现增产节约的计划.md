The First Team of the Guoging Brigade of the Jiulonggang Mine Has Achieved Both "Tiger Hunting" and Production
Xinhua News Agency dispatch

The entire workforce of the First Team of the Guoging Brigade of the Jiulonggang Mine under the Huainan Mining Bureau, in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement conducted throughout the mine this January and February, thanks to first finding concrete ways to ensure that "tiger hunting" and "production" do not interfere with each other, not only struck many "tigers" but also exceeded the original production target for January and February (January 2nd to February 25th) by 11.37%.

After the movement began, the Communist Party members in this team put forward the slogan, "Simultaneous tiger hunting and safe production, achieving both without interference, is the only way to achieve victory." All fifty-four members of the team first engaged in criticism and self-criticism, and everyone clearly recognized the great significance of the movement and the role that the working class should play in it. Then, they studied the specific circumstances and decided to focus on widespread mobilization of denunciations as the main task. To avoid hindering production, they decided to select seven Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists from the morning, middle, and night shifts to form a "tiger hunting team." The "tiger hunting team" members did not leave their production posts; they played a bridge role in the movement, holding half-hour meetings every day before the workers went to work, reporting on the progress of the anti-corruption struggle throughout the mine, encouraging everyone to bravely report offenses, and asking everyone to ensure production and not be distracted while working underground. In this way, the workers continued to produce as usual during working hours, and wrote denunciation materials after returning home from work. After the "tiger hunting team" members collected the denunciation materials, they handed them over to the "headquarters" to provide the leadership with materials for research and investigation. When necessary, the team's workers also participated in "tiger hunting" in their spare time. In order not to affect the safety of production in the "tiger hunting" battle, a safety committee member was selected for each shift, and the safety committee member inspected the underground production environment every day, and reported any problems to the technicians for timely resolution. The team's workers demonstrated a high degree of political awareness on the "tiger hunting" front. Every worker wrote denunciation materials. Worker Zhang Huaqi (a Communist Party member) reported the corrupt official Zhang Qingfang, who had embezzled more than 40 million yuan. Worker Wu Hengshan reported the corrupt official Xie Yujin, who had stolen 800 jin of iron, and mobilized a confessed corrupt official to report another big thief who had stolen 2,500 jin of iron. On the production front, they actively used their brains to find "tricks" to increase output. For example, the workers found the "trick" of installing a "coal chute" on the wooden pillars of the pseudo-inclined working face, which solved the difficulty of not being able to fill the gangue, and increased production efficiency by more than double. For another example, the workers actively improved the operating methods. Previously, a two-meter-deep groove had to be dug into the upper end of the working face first, requiring two workers per shift. Now the workers have broken with conservative thinking and no longer dig grooves, but let the pneumatic drill operators mine themselves according to the progress, which saves six workers per round shift and is much safer than before.

Nankou Railway Factory Launches Production Competition to Improve Production Efficiency and Support the Anti-Corruption Struggle

In the anti-corruption struggle, the Nankou Railway Factory repeatedly exceeded its targets, completing 119.7% of its production task in January and 114.43% in February, winning the Tianjin Railway Administration's January rotating red flag.

After the anti-corruption movement was launched, the workers' class consciousness was raised, and each workshop selected its own "tiger hunting" representatives. They helped their "tiger hunting" representatives collect more than 600 pieces of material and launched an encirclement and suppression campaign against the big corrupt officials. During the movement, the factory director (also the secretary of the Party's general branch) and the Party branch secretaries of each workshop were responsible for leading the anti-corruption movement, and the deputy factory director and the administrative directors of each workshop spent most of their time leading production. Therefore, the factory's production work was also done very well. The workers launched a production competition to support their "tiger hunting" representatives. The Sun Fenggao steam team in the locomotive workshop guaranteed that their "tiger hunting" representative could concentrate on "tiger hunting," and eight people completed the production tasks of ten people. The workers all displayed their initiative and creativity in the movement, and put forward a total of sixteen rationalization proposals in two months. The rationalization proposals put forward by Yu Guilin and Kang Rujun alone can save more than 45,000 jin of rice a year. (Zhang Mingyuan)

Beijing Clothing Factory Implements a Division of Labor Responsibility System, and Output and Quality Gradually Improve in February

The cadres of the Beijing Clothing Factory, except for those with unclean hands and feet, were all put into the anti-corruption struggle in January, and the leadership of production management work was relaxed for a while, which was unavoidable at the time. In early February, the factory had taken the following necessary measures: 1. Further implement the division of labor responsibility system. In addition to designating the deputy factory director to be responsible for the overall production management work, the trade union and each subordinate unit respectively designated deputy personnel or foremen to be responsible for production management work. The security department selected representatives from among the workers to lead production; the representatives were responsible for production management work on the principle of not leaving production. 2. Strengthen the education of employees that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement must be combined with production, so that employees further clarify the view of "not forgetting production when fighting tigers, and not forgetting fighting tigers when producing." 3. Mobilize workshops and individuals to formulate production plans combined with the anti-corruption struggle, and launch a production competition. 4. Streamline the "tiger hunting" organization to make it as small and efficient as possible without affecting "tiger hunting." After these measures were taken, the entire production has returned to normal, and the output and quality have gradually improved. The average output of the first sewing department in the second half of February exceeded the production increase and savings plan by 8.45%, and the quality reached more than 95%. In the anti-corruption struggle, the class consciousness of the general workers has been significantly improved, and their production enthusiasm has been further enhanced. For example, sewing female worker Liu Wenqing, who was previously not politically active and not enthusiastic about production, only made 34.3 pairs of lined socks a day, far from the standard output of 58 pairs; now she has simply become another person. When she is producing, she is afraid of delaying production if others talk to her. Her daily output has increased to 63 pairs, an increase of 83.67% compared to the past.

While achieving great victories on the production increase and savings front, the anti-corruption movement is also being carried out more deeply. (Wang Zexiang, Guan Jingyi)

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争中改进业务工作实现增产节约的计划
    九龙岗矿场国庆大队第一队做到了“打虎”生产两不误
    淮南矿务局九龙岗矿场国庆大队第一队全体工人，在今年一、二月份全矿开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，由于首先找出了“打虎”和“生产”两不相误的具体办法，不但打中很多“老虎”，而且超过一、二月份（一月二日至二月二十五日）原生产任务百分之十一点三七。
    运动开始以后，这个队里的共产党员提出了“一面打虎，一面安全生产，做到两不相误，才算胜利”的口号。全队五十四个人首先展开批评与自我批评，每个人都明确地认识了运动的伟大意义和工人阶级在这一运动中应起的作用。接着，他们研究了具体情况，决定以普遍发动检举为主要工作。为了不妨碍生产，大家又决定从早、中、夜三班中抽出共产党员、青年团员和积极分子七人组成“打虎队”。“打虎队”队员不脱离生产，他们在运动中起桥梁作用，每天在工人上班前举行半小时的会议，会上报告全矿场反贪污斗争的进展情况，一面鼓动大家勇敢检举，一面要求大家保证生产，在井下工作时不要分心。这样，工人每天上班时照常生产，放工回家以后就写检举材料。当“打虎队”队员把检举材料收齐以后，就交到“司令部”去，供给领导方面研究追查。必要时该队工人还利用工余时间参加“打虎”。工人们为了在“打虎”战斗中不影响生产的安全，每班都选出了一个保安委员，由保安委员每天检查井下生产环境，发现问题就报告技术员及时解决。全队工人在“打虎”战线上表现了高度的政治觉悟，每个工人都写了检举材料，工人张华其（共产党员）检举了贪污四千多万元的贪污犯张庆芳；工人吴恒山检举了盗窃八百斤铁的贪污犯谢玉金，并动员一个已坦白的贪污犯检举了另一个盗窃两千五百斤铁的大盗贼。在生产战线上，他们积极动脑筋找出“窍门”来增加产量。例如工人们找出了在伪倾斜式掌子面的木柱上安置“煤溜子”的“窍门”，解决了矸子充填不上的困难，并使生产效率提高一倍以上。又如工人们积极改进了操作方法，以前工作面上端先要向内掏出二公尺深的凹槽，每班需人工两个，现在工人们打破了保守思想，不再掏槽，由风镐手按进度自己开采，这样每一圆班省人工六个，并且比以前安全得多。（据新华社消息）
    南口铁路工厂展开生产竞赛  提高生产效率支持反贪污斗争
    南口铁路工厂在反贪污斗争中，一再超额完成任务，一月份完成生产任务百分之一百一十九点七，二月完成生产任务百分之一百一十四点四三，获得了天津铁路管理局一月份的循环优胜红旗。
    反贪污运动展开以后，职工阶级觉悟提高了，各车间都选出了自己的“打虎”代表。他们帮助自己的“打虎”代表搜集材料达六百多件，对大贪污犯展开围攻。在运动中，厂长（兼党的总支书记）及各车间党支部书记负责领导反贪污运动，副厂长及各车间行政主任以大部时间领导生产。因此，这个厂的生产工作也搞得很好。工友们展开生产竞赛，以支持他们的“打虎”代表。机车所孙凤皋蒸汽小组保证自己的“打虎”代表安心“打虎”，八个人完成了十个人的生产任务。职工们在运动中都发挥了积极性和创造性，两个月来共提出合理化建议十六件。仅于桂林和康如珪两人提出的合理化建议，一年内就可以节省四万五千多斤米。（张名远）
    北京被服厂实行分工负责制  二月份产量质量都逐步提高
    北京被服厂的干部，除了手脚不干净的以外，一月份全部投入反贪污斗争，一度放松了生产管理工作的领导，这在当时是难免的。二月上旬，这个厂已采取了下列的必要措施：一、进一步实行分工负责制，除指定副厂长负责全面生产管理工作外，工会和所属各单位分别指定副职人员或工长负责生产管理工作。保全部由工人当中选出代表来领导生产；代表在不脱离生产的原则下负责生产管理工作。二、加强对职工进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动必须与生产相结合的教育，使职工进一步明确“打虎不忘生产，生产又不忘打虎”的观点。三、发动车间及个人订立与反贪污斗争相结合的生产计划，并开展生产竞赛。四、精简“打虎”组织，使它在不影响“打虎”的情况下，尽量短小精干。采取了这些措施后，整个生产已转入正常状态，产量质量逐渐提高。第一缝纫部二月份下半月的平均产量超过增产节约计划的百分之八点四五，质量达到百分之九十五以上。在反贪污斗争中，一般职工的阶级觉悟显著提高了，进一步发挥了生产积极性。如缝纫女工刘文清，以前政治不开展，生产不积极，每天只做三十四点三双夹袜，相距五十八双的标准产量很远；现在简直变成了另一个人，在生产时，别人和她说话，她都怕耽误生产，每天产量已提高到六十三双，比过去提高了百分之八十三点六七。
    在取得增产节约战线上很大胜利的同时，反贪污运动也正在更深入地开展。（王泽瀛、官静一）
