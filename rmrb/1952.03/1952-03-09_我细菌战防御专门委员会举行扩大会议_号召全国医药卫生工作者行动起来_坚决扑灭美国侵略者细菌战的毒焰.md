Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: The General Association of the Chinese Medical Association held an enlarged meeting of the Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committee of the Chinese Medical Association on the 8th, calling on medical and health workers to go to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare. More than 80 well-known experts in bacteriology, entomology, biology, and other fields from across the country attended the meeting.

At the meeting, Fu Lianzhang, Director of the General Association of the Chinese Medical Association, spoke first. He said: The heinous American aggressors have continuously committed heinous crimes by spreading bacteria and insects in large quantities in Northeast China, and we cannot sit idly by. I call on the experts present and the national medical and health workers to take more active action and go to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare. Fu Lianzhang pointed out: We should redouble our vigilance, quickly organize ourselves, and carry out epidemic prevention and propaganda work on epidemic prevention with the help of the People's Government; at the same time, we must strengthen research work, improve epidemic prevention technology, and strive to do a good job in epidemic prevention.

Subsequently, Tang Feifan, Director of the Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committee of the Chinese Medical Association and expert in bacteriology, reported on the situation of the previous two meetings, and Fang Shishan, General Secretary of the General Association of the Chinese Medical Association, reported that the local branches of the Chinese Medical Association had successively established Bacterial Warfare Defense Special Committees and that medical and health workers in various places had enthusiastically signed up to go to the front line to put out bacteria. Fang Shishan said: Since the General Association issued a statement protesting against the American aggressors for spreading bacteria in Korea, the next day, experts in bacteriology, entomology, and other fields in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places responded enthusiastically, and 44 experts formed a volunteer anti-US aggression and aid Korea epidemic prevention and inspection team to go to the Korean front line to work. Subsequently, medical and health workers in various places requesting to participate in the epidemic prevention and inspection team increased day by day. For example, Peking University had 890 people who signed up at one time. Fang Shishan said: We are all warriors who put out bacteria, and we should take active action and respond to Director Fu's call to go to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare.

The meeting also discussed epidemic prevention propaganda and education work, compiling epidemic prevention booklets, and holding epidemic prevention training courses. The experts present spoke enthusiastically and expressed their enthusiastic response to Director Fu's call.

Finally, He Cheng, Honorary Director of the General Association of the Chinese Medical Association, spoke. He said: The American aggressors have burned the poisonous flames of bacterial warfare to Northeast China. The Chinese people cannot tolerate the crime of the American air force invading Korea spreading bacteria in large quantities to our Northeast. The experts present and the national medical and health workers should organize themselves to strengthen epidemic prevention work; should take active action to go to Korea and Northeast China to put out the poisonous flames of the American aggressors' bacterial warfare, and use our practical actions to counter the shameless atrocities of the American aggressors.
