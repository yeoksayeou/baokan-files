    All-China Federation of Trade Unions Supports Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement
    Angrily Protests the Crime of American Planes Spreading Germs in Northeast China
    [Report from this newspaper] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement expressing resolute support for and endorsement of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement on March 8th, protesting the U.S. government's use of bacteriological weapons to slaughter the Chinese people and infringe upon China's airspace. The statement said: The towering crimes of the American aggressors in spreading bacteria in Korea and in our Northeast once again prove that the American aggressors are attempting to use this extremely brutal means to salvage the failure of their aggressive war in Korea, and to expand the evil conspiracy of the war of aggression. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, representing all Chinese workers, lodges a serious protest with the U.S. government with unparalleled anger. We fully support the solemn statement issued by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, on this incident. The U.S. government shall bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by invading our country's airspace, using bacteriological weapons, and indiscriminately bombing, strafing, and killing the Chinese people. We also demand that the people of the world accuse and condemn this atrocity of the American aggressors and completely sever the bloody hands of the American aggressors.
