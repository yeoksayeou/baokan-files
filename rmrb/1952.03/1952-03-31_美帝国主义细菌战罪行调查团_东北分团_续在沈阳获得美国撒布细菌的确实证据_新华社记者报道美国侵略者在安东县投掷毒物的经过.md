Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 29th: The Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Group on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by American Imperialism" investigated locations in Shenyang on the 27th where bacteria-carrying insects were first and most recently discovered. Local residents provided the investigation group with concrete evidence of American aggressors spreading bacteria in Shenyang City and its surrounding areas.

The branch saw various poisonous insects, including flies, black springtails, spiders, and ants, that American planes had spread in Jiuzhan Village, Jiuzhan District, in the suburbs of the city, as early as March 3rd. They also heard accusations from witnesses. Zhao Wenxiu, a 73-year-old man who is currently ill, heard that the investigation group had come to the village and hurriedly asked the village chief, Zhang Guichun, to carry him to denounce the heinous crimes of American imperialism. The old man Zhao Wenxiu said, "On the afternoon of March 3rd, at around 4 o'clock, the farmer Liu Guangyi discovered many black springtails, spiders, ants, and other insects on both sides of the river ditch northwest of the village. He later caught some to show me; I was very surprised at the time. My family has lived here for generations, and I have never seen insects born in the frozen and snowy weather, let alone these strange-looking insects." As the investigation group was leaving the village, Zhao Wenxiu pointed to an eight-year-old girl and said, "The American devils are spreading bacterial insects, not only to kill us old people, but also to kill these children. Please let the investigation group tell the people of the world about the crimes of the American devils using germ warfare to destroy mankind!"

On the afternoon of the 27th, the branch inspected the Northeast Library in the urban area. Zhao Qi and other staff members of the library reported to the investigation group that dense red spiders and small flies were found in the library courtyard and on the artificial hill at 3 p.m. on the 20th. Members of the investigation group saw poisonous insects such as spiders and flies that had been spread by American planes on the artificial hill of the library.

The branch also went to the dormitory for staff members of the Northeast People's Government Trade Department on Yangwu Street, Nanshi District, for an on-site investigation. Li Shangping, a staff member of the department, testified, "At 11:10 p.m. on the 15th, Zhang Kuicai, a firefighter from the nearby Nanshi District Fire Brigade, and Sun Jiaxun, a guard soldier from the Northeast People's Government Public Security Department, saw a white object falling from the sky and towards our dormitory. They immediately reported it to the local epidemic prevention authorities. After receiving the notice, we gathered more than a hundred people and searched the dormitory area with torches and flashlights. We quickly found more than ten kinds of poisonous insects, such as spiders, flies, ants, and crickets, on the cement-built court, on the walls of the courtyard, and on the corridor on the second floor." Wu Zhongyi, a 59-year-old nanny, pointed to the court and said, "At 11 p.m. on the 15th, I walked to the center of the court with a torch and found dozens of green-headed flies and some grasshoppers. I have never seen such a strange thing. These flies are usually only found in toilets or garbage dumps in the hottest weather, and grasshoppers should be in grassy areas; there are no toilets, garbage dumps, or puddles around this court, and there is no grass on the ground. Therefore, it must have been spread from the air by American planes."

Xinhua News Agency, Andong, March 29th: Our correspondent reports on the American bacteriological warfare criminals dropping poisonous substances in Beijingzi District and Longwangmiao, Andong County, Liaodong Province:

After learning that American planes had dropped a large amount of poisonous substances such as chicken feathers, goose feathers, and duck feathers in Longwangmiao, Andong County, on the 11th, the reporter rushed to the scene for investigation; when passing through Beijingzi Village in Beijingzi District of the county, I learned that the same situation had occurred here. According to Wu Jingming, the village chief, "At about 11 a.m. on March 11, more than 400 people in the village were on their way home after their mutual aid work was finished. Suddenly, they saw three planes flying from northwest to southeast. Many people saw one of them drop a package, which gradually fell to the southeast of the village. Militiamen Jiang Wenchang, Ning Hongde, and others immediately went to search the area and found a large number of chicken feathers, duck feathers, goose feathers, and a small amount of cotton containing bacteria scattered within a two-li radius." The reporter saw that these chicken feathers, duck feathers, and goose feathers were all white, half an inch long, mostly downy, resembling dandelion fluff, without long plumes, and the feather shafts were soft and easily blown up by the wind and difficult to stick to the soil. Lin Ruxi, an old man who has lived in the village for more than 60 years, said, "We only have yellow and black chickens here, where are such chicken feathers from?" Eyewitness Jiang Wenchang added, "The weather was clear that day, with a slight northwest wind. The three planes came from the direction of Longwangmiao in the northwest, and they sometimes flew in crisscross patterns. The thing dropped from the plane shone brightly in the sunlight, and we found so many chicken feathers, duck feathers, and goose feathers where it landed." After they described the process of discovering the poisonous substances containing bacteria at that time, they unanimously accused the American bacteriological warfare criminals of carrying out the heinous crimes of germ warfare.

The reporter ended the investigation in Beijingzi Village and went to Longwangmiao Town, 70 li away from Beijingzi Village. Wu Qingfu, a resident of the town who first discovered the poisonous substances containing bacteria, told the reporter, "Not long after we heard the sound of the plane that morning, chicken feathers, duck feathers, and goose feathers fell all over the town." The chicken feathers, duck feathers, and goose feathers that the reporter found here were the same as those found in Beijingzi Village.

   “美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团
    续在沈阳获得美国撒布细菌的确实证据
    新华社记者报道美国侵略者在安东县投掷毒物的经过
    【新华社沈阳二十九日电】“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团二十七日调查了沈阳市最早和最近发现带细菌毒虫的地点。当地居民向调查团提供了美国侵略者在沈阳市及其周围地区撒布细菌的确实证据。
    该分团在市郊旧站区旧站村看到了美国飞机早于三月三日即在该地撒布的各种毒虫，其中有苍蝇、黑色跳虫、蜘蛛、蚂蚁等，并听取了见证人的控诉。正在生病的七十三岁老人赵文秀听说调查团来到庄内，赶忙请村长张贵春背着他来控告美帝国主义的万恶罪行。老人赵文秀说：“三月三日下午四点多钟，农民刘广义在村子西北的河沟两旁发现了很多黑色跳虫和蜘蛛、蚂蚁等虫子。他后来抓了一些来给我看；当时我就大吃一惊，我家世代居住在这里，从来没有见过冰天雪地里会生出虫子，更没有见过这些奇形怪状的虫子。”在调查团离开该村时，赵文秀指着一个八岁的小女孩说：“美国鬼子撒布细菌毒虫，它不光是要杀害我们上岁数的人，还要杀害这些孩子们，请调查团把美国鬼子用细菌战来毁灭人类的罪恶告诉给全世界的老百姓吧！”
    二十七日下午，该分团视察了在市区的东北图书馆。该馆工作人员赵琦等向调查团报告说：二十日午后三时，图书馆院内和假山上发现了密集的红蜘蛛和小苍蝇。调查团团员在该馆看到了被美机撒布在该馆假山上的蜘蛛、苍蝇等毒虫。
    该分团又到南市区杨武街东北人民政府贸易部职员宿舍作实地调查。该部工作人员李尚平作证说：“十五日午后十一时十分，附近的南市区消防队员张魁彩和东北人民政府公安部警卫战士孙家训看到天空中飘下一白色物体，向我们宿舍附近坠落，他们立即报告了当地防疫机关。我们接得通知后集合了一百多人，拿着火把和手电筒在宿舍附近进行搜索。我们很快在洋灰筑成的球场上、院墙的墙垣上和二楼走廊上等处发现了蜘蛛、苍蝇、蚂蚁、蟋蟀等十多种毒虫。”五十九岁的保姆吴忠义指着球场说：“十五日夜十一点钟，我举着火把走到球场中心，发现了几十只绿头苍蝇和一些蚂蚱。我从来没见过这样奇怪的事。这种苍蝇从来是在最热的天气里在厕所或垃圾堆上才能发生，蚂蚱应该在青草地里才有；这个球场的周围既没有厕所、垃圾堆或水坑，地面也没有青草。因此这一定是美国飞机从空中撒布下来的。”
    【新华社安东二十九日电】本社记者报道美国细菌战犯在辽东省安东县北井子区和龙王庙投掷毒物的经过说：
    记者获悉美机于十一日在安东县龙王庙投掷大量鸡毛、鹅毛、鸭毛等毒物的消息后，即赶赴现场进行调查；当路过该县北井子区北井子村时，才知道这里也发生了同样的情况。据该村村长吴景明向记者说：“三月十一日十一时左右，全村四百多人互助工毕正在回家的途中，忽然看见三架飞机从西北飞向东南，许多人亲眼看见其中的一架投下了一个包，渐渐向村东南飘落，民兵姜文昌、宁洪德等四人立即前往该处搜寻，在那里发现了二里方圆的地区内散布着大量含有细菌的鸡毛、鸭毛、鹅毛和少量的棉花。”记者见到这些鸡毛、鸭毛、鹅毛都是白色的，毛长半寸，多绒，状似蒲公英絮，无长翎，羽杆质软，易被风吹起，不易沾土。在该村居住六十多年的老汉林汝玺说：“我们这里只有黄色和黑色的鸡，那里有这样的鸡毛？”目击者姜文昌补充说：“当日天晴，微有西北风，那三架飞机是从西北的龙王庙方向飞来的，它们有时还交叉飞行。飞机上投下的那个东西被日光照得闪闪发亮，在它降落的地方，我们就发现了这样多的鸡毛、鸭毛、鹅毛。”他们叙述了当时发现含有细菌的毒物的经过后，一致控诉美国细菌战犯进行细菌战的万恶罪行。
    记者结束了北井子村的调查工作，又到距北井子村七十里的龙王庙镇。该镇最先发现含有细菌的毒物的居民吴庆福告诉记者：“那天上午，我们听到飞机声音不久，满镇就落下了鸡毛、鸭毛和鹅毛。”记者在这里所发现的鸡毛、鸭毛和鹅毛，和在北井子村所发现的一样。
