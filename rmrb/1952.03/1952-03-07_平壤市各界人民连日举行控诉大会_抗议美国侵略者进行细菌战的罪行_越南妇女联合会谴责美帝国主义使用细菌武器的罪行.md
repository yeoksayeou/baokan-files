The protest letter pointed out: While engaging in armistice negotiations, the enemy is plotting to expand the war with this heinous crime, which has aroused even stronger anger from peace-loving people around the world. We, all the literary and art workers in Pyongyang, together with all the Korean people, solemnly protest the heinous crimes of the inhumane American imperialism. The protest letter called on peace-loving people all over the world to rise up and stop the towering crimes of American imperialism in destroying mankind, and demanded severe sanctions against the germ warfare criminals.

Pastors and believers who attended the meeting also spoke one after another, unanimously condemning the heinous crimes of American imperialism. The congress unanimously adopted a protest letter stating: All the Christian believers in Pyongyang express their anger and hatred towards the inhumane crimes of the American imperialists in using bacteriological weapons in the war of aggression against Korea. The protest letter pointed out: This sinful act of the American imperialists shows that they are inhumane beasts. They hypocritically hold the Bible in one hand, clamoring about so-called "humanitarianism" and "universal love," while spreading bacteria and creating sinful acts with the other. We once again sternly condemn them as war criminals who will forever be cursed by mankind. The protest letter concluded: The extremely barbaric and shameless American imperialists will surely be subjected to just sanctions, and the only path before them is destruction. We must fight resolutely to win the final victory in the war of liberation of the motherland and take practical actions to stop the enemy's heinous crimes.

    Recently, American imperialism has used bacteriological weapons to massacre the Korean people, women and children. This barbaric act is a crime against humanity that has been repeatedly condemned by all civilized countries.
    Vietnamese women, who are engaged in a long and arduous struggle to resist French and American imperialists, wholeheartedly appeal to peace-loving women all over the world to sternly denounce this crime and strengthen the struggle to stop the bloody hands of the imperialist war-mongers, in order to defend world peace and protect the lives of our children.
