Let All Mothers Under Heaven Accuse!
    -- A Record of Unlawful Capitalists Poisoning Children's Lives
    Gu Xiaolan
    Mothers everywhere, please listen! Let me tell you how unscrupulous and conscienceless illegal capitalists are harming and killing our children.
    The Secret of "Zhegu Cai"
    Mothers, you all know about "Zhegu Cai," "Erbao," and other so-called "children's medicines," right? But did you know that within these "children's medicines," unscrupulous merchants are not only swindling your money but also pushing your children towards sickness and death? What exactly is this Hongxing "Zhegu Cai," which was once sold widely across the country and deep into rural areas? It turns out that it, along with more than thirty other "pediatric miracle cures" like Shanghai's "Baishui Cai," "Jijin Cai," and "San San Cai," are simply made from toxic santonin and calomel. Although these things can only expel roundworms, they are easy to make and bring huge profits. Just one hundred and twenty yuan worth of santonin and calomel, mixed with some starch, can be concocted into a package of "medicine" that can be sold for four or five thousand yuan. How to make it sell well? The evil Hongxing "Zhegu Cai" boss, Zhang Siyun, employed the inherent deceptive skills of the bourgeoisie. He touted "Zhegu Cai," which could only expel worms and shouldn't be eaten frequently or in large doses, as a "holy medicine" that "can cure all children's diseases" and "maintain health even when not sick." Look at that package insert! See how this shameless profiteer describes "Zhegu Cai" as universally effective, beneficial without any drawbacks, even prescribing dosages for nursing infants under one year old who definitely have no roundworms. When mothers saw the words "...measles, rashes, fever, chills, diarrhea, acute and chronic infantile convulsions...suitable for all diseases," "whether sick or not, taking it once a week can prevent illness and turn weakness into strength..." and saw the two plump children printed on the packaging, who wouldn't happily buy it? Last year, a pediatrician from Shanghai's Nanshi Railway Station reported to the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau: "In the laboring people's area around our South Railway Station, when children have fever, vomiting, or even measles or pneumonia, they often take 'Zhegu Cai.'" And many mothers usually followed the package insert, giving it to their children once a week. Mothers! Think about it, what will happen when sick and weak infants with fever and rashes take "Zhegu Cai," which contains toxins and can only expel worms? What will happen when healthy, chubby children regularly take "Zhegu Cai" containing toxins? It will only worsen the condition of sick children or cause chronic poisoning in healthy children.
    But the utterly black-hearted profiteers were not satisfied with the money they were making; they even used "Zhegu Cai" that had deteriorated to poison children. There was a saying in the Western medicine industry: "The gold and US dollars of the Western medicine industry are in 'Zhegu Cai.'" The profiteers hoarded large quantities of "Zhegu Cai" to manipulate and inflate prices. As mentioned earlier, one of the ingredients in "Zhegu Cai" is a drug called calomel. If stored for a long time, or exposed to sunlight or moisture, calomel turns into something called corrosive sublimate. Corrosive sublimate is even more toxic; after eating it, children immediately develop oral ulcers, nausea, and vomiting, leading to death. Last year, when the Health Bureau banned "Zhegu Cai," they found many hardened lumps of "Zhegu Cai" in various sales outlets. Several tests showed that it was "deteriorated, toxic, and not suitable for internal use." However, the bloodthirsty profiteers, after the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau explained the dangers of "Zhegu Cai" and announced its ban, still dared to rush to buy and hoard it, preparing to sell it at high prices on the black market and continue to poison children. The maliciousness of these profiteers' hearts is evident.
    What are "Erbao" and "Little Pearl Pills"?
    Let's take a look at "Erbao," which has also been sold for more than twenty years. Besides the oral medicine in "Erbao" that deceives people like "Zhegu Cai," there is also a topical application. The package insert deceives people: "For colds, fever, and incomplete rashes, apply externally." For "complex conditions and severe symptoms," use both internal and external applications for "faster results." Children hate taking bitter medicine and have to have their noses pinched to force it down. Applying "Erbao" externally only requires applying it to the child's pulse before bed, and the next day, a bruise will appear on the skin. The package insert says that the disease has been "extracted." Mothers are unwilling to have their children suffer the pain of taking medicine, so they often use topical medicine. When they see a bruise the next day, they are truly overjoyed, thinking that the child's illness has been "extracted." So they relax and no longer seek medical treatment. Who knew that this bruise would delay treatment and cost the lives of so many children! It turns out that, according to the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau's tests at the end of last year, whether applied to the pulse of adults or children, whether sick or not, "Erbao" applied externally would always produce a bruise. This is just a normal reaction of the skin to the drug's stimulation. It has absolutely no medicinal effect on children's illnesses!
    The "Little Pearl Cough Pills," which claimed to resolve phlegm and stop coughs, were falsely declared by the profiteers to the Health Bureau as containing only mild ingredients such as "Chuan Bei Mu," "Xiang Bei Mu," and "almonds" when applying for registration; and they used radio stations to promote them extensively. When kind people believed the lies of the illegal capitalists and gave them to their children, not a single child didn't cry in extreme pain and have incessant diarrhea. At the end of last year, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau received a tip and questioned the "inventor," Ye Zitang, who shamelessly replied: "I definitely prepared it according to the registered prescription, without adding other drugs." But when the Health Bureau personnel tasted a "Little Pearl Pill," their mouths immediately went numb, and their throats ached for a long time. It turned out that the profiteers had added highly toxic croton to the pills! Readers, a strong adult who tasted one pill had a numb mouth and a sore throat. What consequences will occur when it is swallowed into a child's delicate stomach?
    "Zebra Little Angel" Kills People
    Illegal capitalists not only try every means to swindle money but also disregard drug standards, health and life, government decrees, and so on. The "Blue Package Zebra Little Angel" of the Malay Pharmaceutical Factory was a drug that was manufactured crudely and sold privately without the approval of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau. The main ingredients of this so-called "latest experimental pediatric special medicine" were also santonin and calomel. According to the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau's dosage standards for children's deworming medicine, a package or pill of deworming medicine can only contain 0.004 grams of santonin and 0.008 grams of calomel, but the illegal capitalists of the Malay Pharmaceutical Factory recklessly and crudely put 0.066 grams of santonin and 0.053 grams of calomel in the "Blue Package Zebra Little Angel," which is more than ten times the standard stipulated by the Health Bureau. With such a heavy dose of poison, how could children not be poisoned to death after eating it? In August 1950, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau received a letter of accusation from a citizen of Qinhuangdao, accusing the "Blue Package Zebra Little Angel" of poisoning a child to death!
    Tap Water in "Osterlin Calcium Injections"
    The capitalists who only care about profit adopt all kinds of conscienceless deceptive methods to poison children's health and lives. Huang Ligang, the boss of Shanghai Dafang Pharmacy, used gauze to filter out the sediment from the already spoiled Osterlin calcium injections and then put them back into the original bottles. When the drug solution was not full after filtering, the profiteer Huang Ligang would add tap water. These injections were mostly used for children with weak lungs. Children who used this injection all had redness and festering at the injection site. Can you imagine the consequences of injecting these bad drug solutions, which contain various large amounts of bacteria and added raw water, into children's bloodstreams?
    The ugly bourgeoisie deceives the people and kills children in this way. Although we cannot yet statistically determine the number of victims, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau's life statistics shockingly tell us that out of the 98,595 deaths in Shanghai from July 1950 to June 1951, children under the age of 15 accounted for 55,347, accounting for 56 percent of the total deaths. When these innocent and lively children died in their mothers' arms with "no medicine effective," who knew that many of them were delayed and poisoned to death by the fake and shoddy medicines of illegal capitalists?

    让普天下的母亲们都来控诉吧
    ——记违法资本家毒害儿童生命的罪行
    顾小岚
    请普天下的母亲们都来听一听吧！让我来告诉你们，丧尽天良的违法资本家们怎样伤天害理地杀害着孩子们的生命。
    鹧鸪菜的秘密
    母亲们谁都知道鹧鸪菜、儿宝等所谓“儿童良药”吧，但可曾知道就在这些“儿童良药”里，奸商们一手骗取了你们的钞票，一手把你们的孩子推向病弱和死亡呢？这个曾经广销全国、深入农村的宏兴鹧鸪菜，究竟是一种什么样的东西呢？原来它和上海什么百岁菜、鸡金菜、三三菜等三十多种的“儿科圣药”一样，只不过是由含有毒性的山道年和甘汞所做成的东西。这种东西虽然只能驱蛔虫，却是制做简单、一本万利的好生意。它只需一百一二十元的山道年和甘汞，搀加一些淀粉，就能调研成一包可骗卖到四五千元的“成药”了。怎样才能畅销呢？恶毒的宏兴鹧鸪菜老板张思云就施展出资产阶级固有的欺诈本领来了。他把只能驱虫，不能常吃多吃的鹧鸪菜，吹嘘成“能除小儿百病”、“无病可保健康”的“圣药”。你们看看那张仿单吧，你们看这个无耻的奸商怎样把鹧鸪菜说得百灵百效、有利无弊，甚至连一岁以内决无蛔虫的吃奶婴儿，也规定了他们的服量。当母亲们看见了“……痧子麻痘、发热发冷、下痢腹泻、急慢惊风……百病皆宜，”“有病无病每星期服一次能预防疾病，转弱为强……”的仿单，再看看包装上印制的两个肥壮小孩，谁不高高兴兴来买它呢？去年上海南市火车站的一位小儿科医师就向上海市人民政府卫生局反映过：“在我们南火车站一带的劳动人民中，当小儿发热、吐奶，甚至发生麻疹、肺炎等时，也多服用鹧鸪菜。”并有许多母亲平时也按照仿单，每星期给孩子们服用一次。母亲们！请想想看吧，当并无蛔虫，而正在发热、发痧的病弱婴儿吃了含有毒性、只能驱虫的鹧鸪菜后，会产生什么样的结果呢？当无病肥胖的孩子，经常服用含有毒性的鹧鸪菜，又会产生什么样的结果呢？只有使有病的孩子们的病情增加或使健康的孩子们慢性中毒罢了。
    但黑透心肝的奸商们还嫌钞票赚得不够，还把放得变了质的鹧鸪菜去毒害儿童。西药界有过这样的话：“西药界的黄金美钞是鹧鸪菜。”奸商们就囤集了大批鹧鸪菜来操纵哄抬。前面所说鹧鸪菜中有一种叫做甘汞的药，如收藏日久，或经日晒、湿气后，甘汞就变成了一种叫做升生汞的东西。升生汞毒性更猛烈，吃了以后，小儿立即口腔腐烂、作呕作吐，以致于死亡。去年卫生局取缔鹧鸪菜时，即发现各个承销店里许多结成硬块的鹧鸪菜，几次化验结果都是：“变质、有毒，不能内服。”可是杀人不见血的奸商们在上海市人民政府卫生局说明鹧鸪菜的危害、公布取缔时，竟还敢抢购囤积起来，准备黑市贵价出售，继续毒害儿童。奸商心肝之恶毒，由此可见。
    儿宝和小珍珠丸是什么东西
    让我们再来看看也曾经销行二十多年的“儿宝”吧。儿宝，它除了有和鹧鸪菜一样欺骗人民的内服剂外，还有一种外敷用的东西。仿单中欺骗人们：“感冒发热、痧疹不透、应用外敷”，至于“病情复杂、症势沉重”的就内外并用，“奏效更速”。孩子们吃苦药，是要捏着鼻子灌下去的。外敷儿宝只要临睡前调敷在小儿脉息上，第二天就在皮肤上发现青瘢，仿单上就说病已“提出”了。母亲们谁不愿意自己孩子减少吃药痛苦，因此就常用外敷药，当第二天果然看见一块青瘢时，真是喜从心中来，以为孩子的病已被“提出”了。于是放下心来，不再延医诊治了。谁知就在这块青瘢下，贻误了多少孩子的生命！原来，经上海市人民政府卫生局去年底检验结果，外敷儿宝无论敷在大人、小孩，无论敷在有病、无病的脉息上，都会同样的发生一块青瘢的。因为这只不过是一种药性刺激皮肤后的一定反应。对孩子们的任何疾病，都毫无医疗作用的！
    自称化痰止咳的小珍珠化痰丸，奸商到卫生局申请登记时，却谎称药料只是一些“川贝母”“象贝母”“杏仁”等平和药物；并且利用广播电台大肆宣传。当善良的人们听信了违法资本家的谎言，给孩子服用时，孩子们没有一个不是痛极啼哭、腹泻不止的。去年底上海市人民政府卫生局得到密告，查询“发明人”叶紫堂时，他还无耻地回说：“确按照登记处方配制，未加其他药物。”可是当卫生局人员拿了一粒“小珍珠丸”试尝药味时，不仅立即满嘴发麻，喉腔还疼痛了很久。原来奸商在丸内放有毒性很大的巴豆！读者们，强健的成人试尝了一粒，就嘴麻喉痛，请问当它吞入小孩娇嫩的肠胃时，会发生什么样的后果呢？
    斑马小天使害死人
    违法资本家除了千方百计骗取金钱外，什么用药标准、健康和生命、政府法令等等一概不放在心里。马来药厂的“蓝包斑马小天使”，就是未经上海市人民政府卫生局核准，粗制滥造，私自售销的一种药品。这个称号“最新实验儿科专药”的主要成分，也只是山道年和甘汞。按照上海市人民政府卫生局小儿驱虫药的剂量标准，一包或一粒驱虫药中，山道年只能放○．○○四公分，甘汞只能放○．○○八公分，但马来药厂的违法资本家，对毒药毫不经意，粗制滥造地在“蓝包斑马小天使”中，放上了○．○六六公分的山道年，和○．○五三公分的甘汞，比卫生局规定的标准超过了十几倍。这样重的毒药，小孩吃下后，还有不被毒死的吗？一九五零年八月上海市人民政府卫生局就曾接到秦皇岛市民的控诉书，控诉“蓝包斑马小天使”毒死儿童的惨事！
    奥斯得灵钙针中放自来水
    唯利是图的资本家，是采用了各种丧尽天良的欺骗方法来毒害儿童健康和生命的。上海大方药房老板黄礼刚曾将已经变坏了的奥斯得灵钙针，用纱布滤去沉淀，再装入原瓶。药水经过滤后，装不满瓶时，奸商黄礼刚就将自来水搀进去。这种针大多是小孩肺部不健时注射用的。凡用了这种针药的小孩，打针处都红肿糜烂了。这些含有各种大量细菌又加进生水的坏药水，注射到儿童血液里去的后果，还能想像吗？
    丑恶的资产阶级就是这样来欺骗人民，杀害儿童的。虽然我们还无法统计出被害儿童的人数，但上海市人民政府卫生局的生命统计数字，即惊人地告诉了我们：一九五零年七月到一九五一年六月一年间，上海市九万八千五百九十五个死亡者中，十五岁以下的儿童就占有五万五千三百四十七人，占全死亡人数的百分之五十六。当这些天真活泼的孩子在“药石无效”死在母亲们的怀抱中时，谁曾知道这当中有许多孩子是被违法资本家的假药伪品所延误毒害而死去的呢？
