    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 9th: Paris dispatch: Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, issued a statement in Paris on the 8th, denouncing the American aggressors for their crimes of using bacteriological weapons in Korea. The full text of the statement is as follows: I was shocked to receive a telegram from Mr. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, reporting the news that American troops are using bacteriological weapons in Korea.

    Between January 28th and February 17th, American military aircraft spread plague, cholera, typhoid, and other terrible infectious disease bacteria in the Korean front and rear areas. This appalling action—an action that no sane person would ever think of—has actually happened. This is another heinous crime following the crime of using atomic bombs to destroy hundreds of thousands of people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in a few seconds.

    The use of bacteriological weapons is a clear violation of international law, especially the Geneva Convention of June 17, 1925.

    Japanese troops used bacteriological weapons in China. The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and American social figures have never concealed the United States' preparations and intentions to use such weapons.

    This heinous act directly violates the resolution adopted by the Warsaw Conference of the World Peace Congress, which expressed the desire of all mankind to prohibit bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

    Five hundred million men and women support the Stockholm Appeal, demanding the prohibition of such weapons, which clearly shows their hope that such slaughter will not recur. Today, people can see the danger they face and the brutal terror tactics taken by some to force them into submission.

    Public opinion must rise up to condemn this crime.

    约里奥—居里发表声明
    痛斥美国发动细菌战争
    号召全世界舆论斥责美国侵略者罪行
    【新华社布拉格九日电】巴黎消息：世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里于八日在巴黎发表声明，痛斥美国侵略者在朝鲜使用细菌武器的罪行。声明全文如下：我接到中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若先生报告美国军队在朝鲜使用细菌武器的消息的来电，感到非常震惊。
    在一月二十八日至二月十七日中间，美国军用飞机在朝鲜前线和后方撒布鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒以及其他可怕传染病的细菌。这种骇人听闻的行动——头脑清醒的人从来不会想到的行动——居然发生了。这是继用原子弹在几秒钟之内毁灭广岛和长崎的几十万人民那种同样穷凶极恶的罪行之后的又一罪行。
    使用细菌武器显然是违反国际法的，特别是违反一九二五年六月十七日的日内瓦公约的。
    日本军队曾在中国使用过细菌武器。美国参谋总部和美国的社会名流以前都没有掩饰过美国使用这种武器的准备工作和意图。
    这种罪恶行为，直接违反世界和平大会华沙会议所通过的表示了全人类愿望的要求禁止细菌武器、化学武器以及其他大量毁灭人类的武器的决议。
    五亿男女拥护斯德哥尔摩宣言，要求禁止这种武器，这已清楚地表明他们希望这种屠杀不会重现。今天，人们可以看到他们面临的危险以及有人为了强迫他们俯首帖耳而采取的残暴的恐怖办法。
    舆论必须起来斥责这种罪行。
