    The Korean People are Full of Confidence and Resolutely Smash the US Bacterial Warfare Crimes
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 22nd] People in various parts of Korea continue to hold mass rallies to protest the heinous crimes of the US aggressors in conducting bacterial warfare. A certain ordnance factory of the Korean People's Army held a protest meeting on the 11th. Those present unanimously angrily denounced the crimes of the US aggressors. Worker Kim Sam-soo said: In the past, Japanese imperialism used bacteriological weapons in China in an attempt to make a desperate struggle, but it finally perished. Today, the American imperialists who are following its old path will undoubtedly suffer even greater defeat. All the staff of the factory expressed their determination to exert greater initiative and produce more military supplies to supply the front, in order to punish the US aggressor troops.
    People from all walks of life in Wonsan City, Gangwon Province, have held protest rallies for days, expressing their determination to answer the enemy's atrocities by strengthening production increases and savings and supporting the front lines.
