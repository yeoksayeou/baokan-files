    Guo Peiran, District Chief of the Fourteenth District of Beijing
    Self-Criticism Regarding Selling Public Property to Acquire "Personal Possessions"
    On March 5th, the People's Daily published a reader's letter criticizing our mistake of selling public property to acquire "personal possessions." This criticism is correct. After the start of the anti-corruption movement, the district conducted a review of this matter. Although our sale of broken bricks from the Niangniang Tomb (public property) in Caobali Village in the district was approved by the Suburban Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, our use of these funds to acquire "personal possessions" included two sets of dining utensils (including wine pots and wine cups, etc.), which constitutes a waste; we also bought too many chairs. In the past, I always thought that our agency's "equipment was simple and crude," and I always wanted to make it more "impressive," so this wasteful phenomenon occurred. During the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement, I realized that this style of loving "impressiveness" and harming the public interest for the sake of small gains was due to the erosion and influence of bourgeois ideology. I have already made a self-criticism at the general meeting of all comrades in the district people's government, and I guarantee that I will definitely overcome the style of extravagance and waste, strictly abide by the financial system, and eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology in the future. I would like to express my gratitude to the readers who offered us their opinions.

    关于变卖公物置“小家当”的检讨
    三月五日，人民日报刊载了读者来信，批评我们变卖公物置“小家当”的错误。这个批评是正确的。反贪污运动开始后，本区对这件事，已经作了检查。我们变卖本区曹八里村娘娘坟（公产）的碎砖，虽然是经过北京市人民政府郊区委员会批准的，但我们用这笔款置办的“小家当”中，有两桌吃饭用具（包括酒壶、酒盅等），则是一种浪费；买的椅子，也多了一些。我过去总认为我们的机关“设备简陋”，总想把它弄得“排场”一些，所以产生了这种浪费现象。在反贪污反浪费运动中，我认识到这种爱“排场”、损大公利小公的作风，是受了资产阶级思想的侵蚀和影响。我在本区人民政府全体同志大会上，已作了检讨，并保证今后一定要克服铺张浪费的作风，严守财政制度，肃清资产阶级思想的影响。我谨向对我们提意见的读者致以谢意。
    北京市第十四区区长郭裴然
