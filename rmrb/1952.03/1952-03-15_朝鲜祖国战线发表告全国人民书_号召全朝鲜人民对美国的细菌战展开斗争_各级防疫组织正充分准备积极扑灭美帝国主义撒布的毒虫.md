Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 14th: The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front held its 12th meeting on the 10th to discuss countermeasures against germ warfare and passed a letter to the entire nation.

The letter to the people stated: The American aggressors have committed all kinds of atrocities in Korea, but none have been able to subdue our freedom-loving heroic Korean people. Now, they are intensifying their madness by using bacteriological weapons in an attempt to massacre our peaceful residents on a large scale. People all over the world are outraged by the new atrocities committed by the American imperialist bandits in Korea.

The letter to the people pointed out: However, the enemy's sinister conspiracy has begun to be shattered by us. The Korean and Chinese People's Armies and our patriotic and peace-loving people, with a high degree of vigilance, have exposed the enemy's criminal conspiracy in time and taken decisive countermeasures. The State Special Anti-epidemic Committee, according to the order of General Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Military Committee, has actively started work. Anti-epidemic committees at all levels and all medical personnel have taken the necessary measures against the American imperialist's germ warfare.

The letter to the people also stated: With the help of various democratic countries, we have made full preparations to eliminate poisonous insects and deal with infectious diseases. We have sufficient medicines, disinfection equipment, and medical facilities.

The letter to the people finally pointed out: Fighting against the germ warfare of American imperialism is not only the task of medical workers, but also a major political task of all patriotic people. No war means of the robbers can weaken our people's will to love the motherland, nor can they frighten us. Let the enemy know that they cannot conquer us. The Korean people, angered by the heinous atrocities of armed intervention, will unite more closely around their government and leader General Kim Il-sung to defend their just cause.

Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: Vietnamese youth organizations sent a telegram to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, expressing their opposition to the crimes of American imperialist germ warfare. The telegram is as follows:

Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth
Secretariat of the International Student Union

The American imperialists have used bacteriological weapons to slaughter the Korean people. This barbaric act is a crime intolerable to mankind.

The youth and students of Vietnam feel an irrepressible resentment towards the warmongers and vow to strengthen solidarity with the Korean people and the people of the world to sever the evil clutches of these common enemies of mankind.

Vietnam University Students Union
Vietnam Middle School Students Union

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 11th: According to TASS, democratic newspapers in Paris, the capital of France, reported with unparalleled anger the use of bacteriological weapons by the American interventionist army against the people of Korea and China, and published protests from various democratic groups.

"L'Humanité" and "Ce Soir" both pointed out to the French people the danger of American germ warfare. "L'Humanité" published a telegram from 150 students in Paris to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, which stated: "Students are angered by the barbaric dropping of bacteriological bombs in Korea and China by the American armed forces using Japanese war methods. Mr. Secretary-General of the United Nations, we express our strong protest to you and demand the cessation of these inhuman bombardments that threaten residents all over the world and demand punishment."

The bourgeois newspapers reported on the protest lodged by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China against the bombing of Chinese territory and the use of bacteriological weapons by American aircraft, but did not comment.

Many newspapers published an abstract of the statement by Joliot-Curie, President of the World Peace Council, in which he sternly condemned the barbaric crime of germ warfare committed by the American aggressors.
