    Notice from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government
    1. The first list of agricultural bumper harvest models for 1951 who will receive awards has been reviewed and announced by the Ministry. It is hoped that all localities will widely publicize this to the farmers.
    2. The prizes awarded to bumper harvest models in major administrative regions (provinces) will be sent by the Ministry to the agricultural and forestry departments (bureaus) of each region (province) for forwarding. Award ceremonies should be held solemnly to encourage the award-winning models and mobilize the broad masses to actively increase unit area yield. Regarding the use of the prize money, assistance should be given to the award winners to purchase means of production.
    3. The award list for 1951 will be published in batches. Those administrative regions (provinces) with bumper harvest models who have not yet reported for awards are requested to submit the award application materials and photos to the Ministry before the end of March.
