    Health Workers in Yixing County, Southern Jiangsu
    Request to Go to the Front Lines to Participate in Epidemic Prevention Work
    Editor: We, the more than nine hundred health workers in Yixing County, Southern Jiangsu, resolutely oppose the towering crime of American imperialists using bacteriological weapons. Responding to the call of the Chinese Medical Association, we have already formed a volunteer anti-epidemic team to go to Korea. As we are preparing to depart, we are vigorously carrying out publicity about epidemic prevention knowledge and striving to improve epidemic prevention techniques. We are confident that we can completely crush the American imperialists' conspiracy to wage bacteriological warfare.
    All members of the Health Workers Association of Yixing County, Southern Jiangsu
