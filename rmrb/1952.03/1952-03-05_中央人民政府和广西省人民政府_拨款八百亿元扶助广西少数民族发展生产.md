Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 4th: To restore and develop production among ethnic minorities in Guangxi and resolve their current difficulties regarding means of production and livelihood, the Central People's Government and the Guangxi Provincial People's Government have allocated a total of 80.09 billion yuan for the province's ethnic minorities for production and disaster relief. This sum will be used for agricultural loans, investment, and relief in three aspects. The agricultural loan portion includes loans for farm tools, draft cattle, seeds, small-scale water conservancy projects, the processing of local and special products, and handicraft production. The loan policy is to provide loans based on need and key areas. Investment will focus on forestry, mainly cultivating Chinese fir in the ethnic minority areas of Sanjiang, Sanfang (Town), and Rong County, tea trees in the Dayao Mountains, star anise in the Baise area, and tung trees in Yishan and Du'an. Relief is divided into general care and special care, with the main targets of special care being the poorest ethnic minorities, those in border areas, and those in old revolutionary base areas.

To uniformly arrange and lead the production of ethnic minorities throughout the province, the Guangxi Provincial Ethnic Affairs Commission convened a provincial ethnic minority cadre meeting in early February, formulated production plans for each ethnic minority county and district, and established a provincial ethnic minority production committee. Currently, ethnic minority areas throughout the province are preparing to convene county and district ethnic minority production conferences to establish production committees in each county and district.

    拨款八百亿元扶助广西少数民族发展生产
    【新华社南宁四日电】为恢复和发展广西少数民族的生产，解决他们当前的生产资料和生活资料的困难，中央人民政府和广西省人民政府共拨款八百零九亿元，作为该省少数民族生产、救灾之用。这笔款子将分别用于农贷、投资和救济三个方面。农贷部分包括贷放农具、耕牛、种子、小型水利、土特产加工、手工业生产等项目，贷款方针是根据需要和重点贷放。投资是以林业为主，主要是培植少数民族区三江、三防（镇）和融县的杉木，大瑶山区的茶树，百色区的八角，宜山、都安的桐树。救济分普通照顾和特殊照顾两种，特殊照顾的主要对象是最贫苦的、边防地区的和老根据地的少数民族。
    为统一布置和领导全省少数民族的生产，广西省民族事务委员会曾在二月初召开全省少数民族干部会议，制订了各少数民族县、区的生产计划，成立了全省少数民族生产委员会。现在该省各少数民族地区正在筹备召开县、区少数民族生产会议，以便分别建立各县、区的生产委员会。
