Learn from High-Yield Models and Launch a High-Yield Movement
Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Central People's Government, Zhang Linchi

The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government announced the first list of agricultural high-yield models awarded for 1951 on March 16th. These high-yield models are the leading figures who emerged in last year's patriotic high-yield movement. They are clear banners for the vast number of farmers to increase yield per unit area, and an advanced force in developing agricultural productivity in our country. They have proven with facts that China's agricultural production contains unlimited potential power. If we fully unleash this potential power, the yield per unit area of agricultural production in our country can be rapidly increased.

These high-yield models have created new records of high yields that have never been seen before in the history of agricultural production in our country. Their rice yields generally exceeded the national average yield by two to three times. Among them, the rice of Yang Zhenru Group of Dachenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ninghe County, Hebei Province, yielded 1,620 jin per mu, exceeding the national average yield by more than four and a half times. Their wheat yields generally exceeded the national average yield by five times. Among them, the wheat of Shi Anfu in Shaanxi Province yielded 810 jin per mu, exceeding the national average yield by more than seven times. Their cotton yields generally exceeded the national average yield by five times. Among them, the cotton of Qu Yaoli in Shanxi Province yielded 912 jin per mu, exceeding the national average yield by more than nine times. The yields of other millet, corn, soybeans, and potatoes also greatly exceeded ordinary yields.

The emergence of these high-yield models most eloquently demonstrates the superiority of the New Democratic system. During the era of reactionary rule, farmers were subjected to heavy oppression and exploitation by imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism, living a miserable life, to the point that they could not even maintain simple reproduction. Under such circumstances, farmers had neither the conditions nor the mood to increase yield per unit area. High-yield models were fundamentally impossible to emerge. The experience of Shi Anfu, who created a new record of 810 jin of wheat per mu, can illustrate this situation. During the years of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, Shi Anfu's family of seven had only three fen of dry land. He rented one mu and nine fen and five li of paddy field, and had to pay 70 percent of the harvest to the landlord every year. Under such circumstances, how could one hope to increase production? After the birth of New China, the forces of imperialism were expelled, the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was crushed, and the feudal land ownership system was abolished, liberating farmers from thousands of years of oppression and exploitation. This created incomparably superior conditions for the development of agricultural productive forces. The Communist Party and the People's Government implemented policies to reward and support farmers' production, led farmers to organize, and provided strong assistance in technology and materials, thereby launching a large-scale patriotic high-yield movement in rural areas. Therefore, the rapid development of agricultural productive forces, the continuous growth and increase of the yields of various crops, and the large-scale emergence of high-yield models have become an inevitable trend in the development of the rural economy of New China.

In the People's New China, every hard-working farmer has the potential to become a high-yield model. Some people say that the reason why high-yield models achieve high yields is because their production conditions are particularly good. This statement is incorrect. The land cultivated by these high-yield models is not particularly fertile land. Some of them live in mountainous areas, and the natural conditions and land quality are still very poor. So, how did they create particularly outstanding achievements compared to others? This is because they actively responded to the call of the Communist Party and the People's Government for patriotic high-yield, organized, and boldly developed production. In the process of cultivating crops, they not only inherited the rich experience of Chinese farmers in their long-term struggle against nature, but also accepted many new technologies, thereby creating a complete set of advanced high-yield technologies. For example, Qu Yaoli, a cotton high-yield model in Jie County, Shanxi Province, comprehensively improved technology, gave full play to the "combined factors complementary" progressive yield increase effect of various yield-increasing factors, and created a high-yield record of 912 jin of seed cotton per mu. Wu Xuanwen, a cotton high-yield model in Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, created the farming method of "preventing waterlogging during the seedling stage and combating drought during the summer heat." Although in the natural conditions of frequent rain in spring and severe drought in summer in Jiangnan, he still achieved a record of 810 jin of seed cotton per mu. All the deeds of high-yield models fully prove that their production conditions are not particularly superior to others, but only because they work particularly actively than others and are good at studying production technology and overcoming various difficulties, thus achieving brilliant achievements. All the advanced experiences of high-yield models are the valuable property of the working people of our country and the most effective way for our agriculture to achieve high yields under the current conditions.

High-yield models are not only active members on the production front, but also the most politically conscious and ideologically developed figures among the peasant masses. Without this important condition, their high-yield records would not have been created. They actively respond to various calls from the Party and the government, and they are active leaders in implementing government policies. For example, Qu Yaoli not only created outstanding achievements in production, but also was a patriotic cotton-selling model in the cotton-selling and storing movement. For example, Zhang Defang showed the highest degree of consciousness in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. He planted seven mu of cotton and donated seven hundred jin of seed cotton. These high-yield models actively participate in mutual aid and lead and improve mutual aid groups. They have the most acute sense of new things and are willing to be the first to adopt various new technologies. All of these are the reasons why high-yield models can achieve brilliant achievements.

The deeds of high-yield models tell us that increasing yield per unit area is something that the vast number of farmers can do. It can be done whether in areas where production has been restored or in areas where production is being restored, whether in areas with good natural conditions or in areas with less favorable natural conditions. Those who believe that "production has reached its peak," that increasing production can only be achieved by expanding cultivated land, and that yields can only be increased in areas with good farming conditions are all wrong. Qu Yaoli's high-yield cotton fields yielded 745 jin per mu in 1950 and 912 jin per mu in 1951, and it is estimated that this year each mu can produce 1,000 jin of cotton. Yang Shunkui, a high-yield model in Chahar Province, lives in a mountainous area, and the soil quality of his cultivated land is very poor. Last year, he also suffered from a severe drought. However, because he adopted a series of drought-resistant and drought-combating measures in cultivation, his dry-land millet created a high-yield record of 790 jin per mu. It can be seen that the statement that unit yields cannot be increased in areas with poor farming conditions is also baseless.

Conscientiously summarizing and promoting the advanced experiences of high-yield models and guiding the broad masses to move forward under the banner of high-yield models is the concrete application of the mass line leadership method in agricultural production, which is of great significance for universally increasing yield per unit area. Advanced high-yield experience is the labor result of the vast number of farmers in our country in long-term production practice, and it is the most valuable property of the working people of our country. Universally promoting these experiences will add huge wealth to the vast number of farmers and our country. Therefore, all localities should widely publicize the deeds of high-yield models through various meetings, radio, newspapers, pictorials, slides, and all other forms that can be adopted, so that everyone knows about them. Short-term technical training classes should be held to impart high-yield experience; mutual aid groups, agricultural production cooperatives, rural technical research groups, etc. should be mobilized to carefully discuss high-yield experience, absorb these experiences and improve their own cultivation techniques according to local conditions. In this year's patriotic high-yield movement, we must greatly give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of farmers, launch a widespread and enthusiastic movement to learn from advanced experience, and set off a rural upsurge in improving technology. Existing high-yield models should not be arrogant or complacent, but continue to continuously improve their cultivation techniques, patiently unite the broad masses, and create higher high-yield records on a larger area of cultivated land than last year. Many high-yield models have formulated plans to increase production, such as Chen Yongkang and others who have set a plan to produce 1,500 jin of rice per mu this year, and Qu Yaoli and others have also set a plan to produce 1,000 jin of cotton per mu. This spirit of actively striving for high yields is very good and worthy of learning. Farmers across the country must mobilize together, learn from high-yield models, and strive to universally increase yield per unit area! High-yield models, continue to move forward and strive to create new records of higher agricultural output this year!

    向丰产模范看齐，开展丰产运动
    中央人民政府农业部副部长　张林池
    中央人民政府农业部三月十六日发表了奖励一九五一年度农业丰产模范的第一批名单。这些丰产模范是在去年爱国丰产运动中涌现出来的带头人物，是广大农民提高单位面积产量的鲜明旗帜，是我国发展农村生产力的一支先进部队。他们用事实证明了我国农业生产蕴藏着无限的潜在力量。充分地发挥这种潜在力量，我国农业生产单位面积产量，必可迅速提高。
    这些丰产模范，创造了我国农业生产史上从来未有的高额产量的新纪录。他们的水稻产量，一般地超过了全国平均产量的二至三倍，其中河北宁河县大陈庄农业生产合作社杨振儒小组的水稻，每市亩产一千六百二十斤，超过全国平均产量四倍半。他们的小麦产量，一般地超过了全国平均产量五倍，其中陕西史安福的小麦，每市亩产八百一十斤，超过全国平均产量七倍以上。他们的棉花产量，一般地超过了全国平均产量五倍，其中山西曲耀离的棉花，每市亩产九百一十二斤，超过全国平均产量九倍多。其他谷子（粟）、玉蜀黍、大豆及薯类的产量也都大大地超过了普通产量。
    这些丰产模范的出现，最雄辩地说明了新民主主义制度的优越性。在反动统治时代，农民受着帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资本主义的重重压迫和剥削，过着悲惨的生活，以至连单纯的再生产都维持不住。在那种情况下，农民没有条件也没有心情提高单位面积产量，丰产模范是根本不可能出现的。创造每市亩产小麦八百一十斤新纪录的史安福的经历，就可以说明这一情况。在国民党反动统治年代里，史安福一家七口人，只有三分旱地。他租种着一亩九分五厘水地，每年要把收获量的百分之七十缴给地主。在这种情况下，怎么能够希望提高产量呢？新中国诞生后，驱逐了帝国主义的势力，粉碎了蒋介石匪帮的反动统治，废除了封建土地所有制度，把农民从数千年来被压迫被剥削的苦难中解放出来，这就给发展农业生产力创造了无比优越的条件。共产党和人民政府实行了奖励和扶持农民生产的政策，领导农民组织起来，并在技术上和物质上给以大力的援助，从而在农村中，开展了大规模的爱国丰产运动。因此，农业生产力迅速地向前发展，各种作物产量不断生长增高，丰产模范大批地出现，这已经成了新中国农村经济发展的必然的趋势。
    在人民的新中国，每一个勤劳耕作的农民，都有可能成为丰产模范。有人说丰产模范所以获得高额产量，是因为他们的生产条件特别好。这种说法是不对的。这些丰产模范所耕种的土地，并不是特别肥沃的土地，他们中间的某些人住在山区，自然条件和土地的质量还是很差的。那末，他们怎样创造出比别人特别突出的成绩呢？这是因为他们积极地响应了共产党和人民政府提出的爱国丰产的号召，组织起来，放手发展生产；他们在培育作物的过程中，不但继承了我国农民长期向自然进行斗争的丰富经验，并且接受了许多新的技术，从而创造了一整套先进丰产技术。例如山西解县棉花丰产模范曲耀离，全面改进技术，发挥各项增产因素“联因互补”累进增产的作用，创造了每亩产籽棉九百十二斤的丰产纪录。江西彭泽县棉花丰产模范吴宣文，创造了“苗期防涝，伏天抗旱”的耕作方法，虽然在江南春季多雨，夏季亢旱的自然条件下，还达到了每亩产籽棉八百一十斤的纪录。所有丰产模范的事迹完全证明，他们的生产条件并不比别人特别优越，只是由于他们比别人特别积极劳动，并善于钻研生产技术，战胜各种困难，因而获得了光辉的成就。所有丰产模范的先进经验，都是我国劳动人民的宝贵财产，都是我国农业在目前条件下达到丰产的最有效的办法。
    丰产模范不仅是生产战线上的积极分子，而且是农民群众中的政治觉悟最高和思想最开展的人物。如果没有这个重要条件，他们的丰产纪录也是不可能创造出来的。他们积极响应党和政府的各种号召，他们是执行政府政策的积极带头者。例如曲耀离，他不仅在生产上创造了优异的成绩，而且在售棉储棉运动中，也是爱国售棉模范。例如张德芳，他在抗美援朝运动中，表现了最高的觉悟程度。他种了七亩棉花，就捐献了七百斤籽棉。这些丰产模范，积极参加互助，领导与提高互助组。他们对新鲜事物有最敏锐的感觉，愿意首先采用各种新式技术。所有这些，都是丰产模范所以能够获得光辉成就的原因。
    丰产模范的事迹告诉我们，提高单位面积产量，是广大农民都能够做得到的。不论是在生产已经恢复的地区，或是正在恢复的地区，不论是在自然条件良好的地区，或是自然条件不够好的地区，都是能够做得到的。那些认为“生产已经到顶”，只有扩大耕地面积才能增加产量，只有在耕作条件良好的地区才能提高产量的说法，都是错误的。曲耀离的丰产棉田，一九五零年每亩产七百四十五斤，一九五一年每亩产九百一十二斤，估计今年每亩可生产棉花一千斤。察哈尔省的丰产模范杨顺奎，住在山区，他的耕地土质很坏，去年又遭受了严重的旱灾，但是由于他在耕作上采用了一系列的防旱抗旱的措施，他的旱地谷子，竟创造了每市亩产七百九十斤的丰产纪录。由此可见，耕作条件不好的地区不能提高单位产量的说法，也是毫无根据的。
    认真地总结和推广丰产模范的先进经验，引导广大群众在丰产模范的旗帜下前进，这就是群众路线的领导方法在农业生产上的具体运用，这对于普遍提高单位面积产量有着重大的意义。先进丰产经验，是我国广大农民在长期生产实践中的劳动成果，是我国劳动人民的最宝贵的财产，普遍推广这些经验，将为我国广大农民和我们的国家增加巨额财富。因此，各地应通过各种会议、广播、报纸、画刊、幻灯等一切可以采用的形式，广泛宣传丰产模范的事迹，作到家喻户晓。并举办短期的技术训练班，传授丰产经验；发动互助组、农业生产合作社、农村技术研究组等，仔细地讨论丰产经验，并根据当地情况，吸取这些经验，改进自己的耕作技术。在今年的爱国丰产运动中，要极大地发挥广大农民的积极性和创造性，开展一个广泛地、热烈地学习先进经验的运动，掀起农村改进技术的热潮。现有丰产模范应当不骄傲不自满，继续不断地提高自己的耕作技术，耐心地团结广大群众在比去年更大的耕地面积上，创造更高的丰产纪录。许多丰产模范已订出了提高产量的计划，如陈永康等今年已订出每亩产水稻一千五百斤的计划，曲耀离等也订出了每亩产棉花一千斤的计划，这种积极争取高额产量的精神是很好的，值得学习的。全国农民要一致动员起来，向丰产模范看齐，为普遍提高单位面积产量而奋斗！丰产模范们，继续前进，为创造今年农业增产更高的新纪录而斗争！
