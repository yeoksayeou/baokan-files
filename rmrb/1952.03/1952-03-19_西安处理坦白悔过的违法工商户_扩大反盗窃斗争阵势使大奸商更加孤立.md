Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Xi'an Municipal Committee for the Promotion of Thrift and Examination has recently concentrated its efforts on reviewing and handling illegal industrial and commercial households who have confessed and repented. From the 6th to the 14th of this month, it has announced the handling of a total of 9,500 law-abiding and basically law-abiding households, and 1,417 half-law-abiding and half-illegal households. These industrial and commercial households account for 65 percent of the city's total number of industrial and commercial households. This has expanded the anti-theft struggle, further isolating major profiteers.

In the previous stage of the Five-Anti Movement in Xi'an, the rampant arrogance of the profiteers was not completely suppressed due to insufficient mobilization of workers and shop assistants, and the confessions of industrial and commercial households with significant violations were often incomplete. Therefore, in this review and handling of illegal industrial and commercial households, the leadership paid close attention to continuing the work of mobilizing workers and shop assistants. The method of review generally involved industrial and commercial households filling out violation registration forms, which were then discussed and passed by the trade association小组, signed and sealed by the accountant of the business, then reviewed by the shop assistants' review小组, and finally approved by the district Committee for the Promotion of Thrift and Examination. Particular emphasis was placed on the review by the shop assistants' review小组. Therefore, many dishonest and incomplete confessions by illegal capitalists were blocked by the shop assistants at this "hurdle." Many shop assistants, combining accounting and investigative materials, grasped the real situation and then engaged in face-to-face struggles with illegal capitalists. In addition, various districts also used many new methods of struggle in mobilizing shop assistants to review illegal industrial and commercial households, such as simultaneously holding shop assistants' accusation meetings and leniently treated industrial and commercial operators' accusation meetings in nearby areas while shop assistants were reviewing illegal capitalists. If a profiteer refused to confess, the materials exposed at the aforementioned meetings were promptly sent to the review meeting, forcing the reviewed illegal capitalist to confess his illegal facts.

Based on the results of the review, various districts universally convened meetings to announce the results. When the Second District of the city held such a meeting, a conclusion was made on a group of law-abiding and basically law-abiding households, announcing that no refunds or supplements would be made. A small number of basically law-abiding households, whose violations did not exceed two million yuan, were announced to have a portion refunded due to incomplete confessions. For half-law-abiding and half-illegal households, it was generally announced that only refunds would be made without penalties, but a few people who organized "offensive and defensive alliances" and refused to confess were severely punished, in addition to being ordered to pay back three years of evaded taxes, a penalty of double the amount was also imposed. For those who seriously violated the law and refused to confess, workers and shop assistants conducted struggles against them at the meeting, and individual cases with serious circumstances were arrested on the spot by the People's Government.

The Xi'an Municipal Committee for the Promotion of Thrift and Examination plans to basically complete the handling of half-law-abiding and half-illegal households around March 20. Currently, while handling problems, it is actively preparing in terms of organization and policy, and is training senior shop assistants in shifts, in order to fully encircle and suppress major profiteers in the next step.

### 西安处理坦白悔过的违法工商户  扩大反盗窃斗争阵势使大奸商更加孤立

    西安处理坦白悔过的违法工商户
    扩大反盗窃斗争阵势使大奸商更加孤立
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：西安市节约检查委员会最近集中力量审查处理坦白悔过的违法工商户。自本月六日开始到十四日止，已经宣布处理了守法户和基本守法户共九千五百户，半守法半违法户一千四百一十七户。以上工商户共占全市工商户总数的百分之六十五。这样就扩大了反盗窃斗争的阵势，使大奸商更形孤立。
    西安市五反运动的前一个阶段，由于发动工人、店员不够，奸商的猖狂气焰没有全部压下去，违法较大的工商户坦白多不彻底。因此，在这次审查处理违法工商户时，领导方面很注意继续发动工人、店员的工作。这次审查的方法一般是由工商户填写违法登记表，经同业公会小组讨论通过，本号会计签名盖章，再交店员审查小组审查，然后交区节约检查委员会批准。其中就特别着重店员审查小组的审查。因此，许多不老实坦白的违法资本家，在经过这一“关”时，都被店员们卡住了。许多店员结合算账、调查材料，掌握实情，然后和不法资方展开了面对面的斗争。另外各区在发动店员审查违法工商户中，还运用了许多新的斗争方法，如店员在审查违法资本家时，即在就近地区同时分别召开店员检举会和被宽大处理过的工商业者检举会，如遇奸商拒不坦白时，即将上述会议所检举出来的材料及时送到审查会上，使被审查的违法资本家不得不交代出他的违法事实。
    根据审查结果，各区普遍召开了宣布处理大会。该市二区在举行这种大会时，将一批守法户和基本守法户做出结论，宣布不退不补，其中少数基本守法户，违法虽不超过二百万元，但因坦白不彻底，所以宣布补退一部分。对于半守法半违法户，一般宣布只补退不处罚，但有少数人组织“攻守同盟”，拒不坦白，因此加重处理，除宣布补缴三年偷漏税款外，还要照章加罚一倍。对于严重违法又拒不坦白的分子，工人、店员在大会上进行了斗争，个别情节重大的由人民政府当场予以逮捕。
    西安市节约检查委员会计划在三月二十日左右将半守法半违法户基本处理完毕，目前一方面处理问题，一方面在组织上和政策上积极进行准备，轮班训练高级店员，以便下一步全力围攻大奸商。
