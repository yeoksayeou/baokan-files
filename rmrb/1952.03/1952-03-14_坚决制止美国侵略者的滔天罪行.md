    Resolutely Stop the Towering Crimes of the American Aggressors
    Xǔ Déhéng
    After the American aggressors used bacteriological weapons in Korea, carrying out large-scale and inhumane massacres against the Korean people and the Korean and Chinese People's forces, they have aroused universal anger and righteous condemnation from peace-loving people all over the world. However, the American aggressors have not shown the slightest sign of repentance. In addition to cruelly massacring our captured personnel on a large scale using heinous means, they have intensified their bacteriological warfare in Korea and have further openly and shamelessly continued to spread a large number of insects carrying bacteria over our Northeast by aircraft and to carry out indiscriminate bombing, attempting to expand the war of aggression. This towering crime of the American aggressors, who are determined to be enemies of the Korean and Chinese people and the people of the whole world, is absolutely intolerable to us. We, the people of all of China, resolutely support the solemn statement issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government and the various democratic parties of China, thoroughly smash all the bloody conspiracies of the American aggressors, and demand that the ruthless American murderers repay this endless blood debt.
    The people of the whole world can see very clearly: this vicious and shameless criminal activity of the American aggressors is precisely a sign of its increasing demise. History has proven more than once that the more疯狂and brutal an aggressor becomes, the closer it is to death. Before their collapse, the Hitler Nazi bandits built horrific killing factories in Poland and used poison gas on the battlefield. Before their defeat in China, the Japanese bandits also used bacteriological weapons, attempting to save their dying fate. But what was the result? The robbers fell one by one, and human justice won the final victory. Isn't the towering crime committed by the American aggressors today simply following the old path of Hitler and the Japanese warlords?
    However, the aggressors will not willingly accept death. Peace-loving people all over the world must take immediate action to severely stop this grave crime of the US imperialism that tramples on international conventions and violates human justice, and give the war instigators a heavy blow. As Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out, "If the people of the world do not resolutely stop it, then the disaster that has befallen the peaceful people of Korea today will befall the peaceful people of the world tomorrow." Here we want to especially say a word to the American and Japanese people: The American aggressors have committed such an unprecedentedly brutal crime, which is not only a blatant provocation against the Korean and Chinese people, but also a barbaric threat to human dignity and world security. At this critical moment, you should all rise up together and give righteous condemnation and severe sanctions to all the crimes of the American aggressors, especially to the American murderers who use Japanese bacterial warfare criminals to massacre and poison the Korean and Chinese people and undermine world peace.
    The Chinese people, who once defeated Japanese fascism and the Kuomintang bandits, will absolutely not be intimidated by any provocation from the American aggressors today. Under the solemn call of the government and various democratic parties, we must urgently mobilize, continue to strengthen the just action of resisting America and aiding Korea, thoroughly complete the task of the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, increase production, practice strict economy, in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and crush the evil conspiracy of US imperialism to expand the Korean War and provoke a new war. Our national scientific workers and medical and health workers must be prepared to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and go to the forefront of the anti-US imperialist bacteriological war.
    Justice is on our side, and the sympathy of the people of the world is on our side. We will surely win!

    坚决制止美国侵略者的滔天罪行
    许德珩
    美国侵略者在朝鲜使用细菌武器，对朝鲜人民和朝、中人民部队实行大规模的惨无人道的屠杀以后，已引起全世界爱好和平的人民的普遍愤怒和正义声讨。但美国侵略者丝毫没有悔祸的念头，除了用灭绝人性的残暴手段大批虐杀我方被俘人员之外，竟变本加厉地在朝鲜继续进行细菌战争，并进一步公开无耻地连续以飞机在我东北撒布大量传播细菌的昆虫和滥施轰炸，企图扩大侵略战争。美国侵略者这种坚决与朝、中人民和全世界人民为敌的滔天罪行，是我们绝对不能容忍的。我们全中国的人民坚决拥护中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长及中国各民主党派所发表的严正声明，彻底粉碎美国侵略者的一切血腥阴谋，向残暴不仁的美国凶手讨还这无尽的血债。
    全世界的人民都看得很清楚：美国侵略者这种凶恶无耻的罪恶勾当，正是它日趋溃灭的标志。历史不止一次地证明：侵略者愈是表现得疯狂残暴，就说明它愈接近死亡。希特勒纳粹匪徒在溃灭之前，曾在波兰制造过惨绝人寰的杀人工厂，在战场上使用过毒气。日本强盗自中国败退之前，也使用过细菌武器，企图挽救它垂死的命运。但是，结局怎样呢？强盗们一个一个地倒下去了，人类正义获得最后的胜利。美国侵略者今天犯下如此的滔天罪行，不正是走希特勒和日本军阀的老路么？
    但是，侵略者是不会甘心死亡的。全世界爱好和平的人民必须立刻行动起来，严厉制止美帝国主义这种蹂躏国际公约，违反人类正义的严重罪行，给战争挑拨者以沉重的打击。正如周恩来部长所指出：“如果全世界人民不坚决地加以制止，那么，今天落在朝鲜和平人民头上的灾难，明天就会落在世界和平人民的头上。”在这里我们要特别向美国和日本人民进一言：美国侵略者犯下这种空前残暴的罪行，不仅是对朝、中人民的狂妄的挑衅，而且是对人类尊严和世界安全的横暴威胁。在这个严重的关头，你们应一致奋起，对于美国侵略者的一切罪行，特别是对于利用日本细菌战犯来屠杀和毒害朝、中人民破坏世界和平的美国凶手，予以正义的声讨和严厉的制裁。
    曾经战胜了日本法西斯和国民党匪帮的中国人民，今天绝对不会为美国侵略者的任何挑衅所吓倒，我们要在政府和各民主党派的庄严号召之下紧急动员起来，继续加强抗美援朝的正义行动，彻底完成反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争任务，增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，粉碎美帝国主义扩大朝鲜战争和挑拨新战争的罪恶阴谋。我们全国科学工作者和医药卫生工作者必须准备随时响应祖国的号召，走上反美帝国主义细菌战争的最前线。
    正义是在我们这方面，全世界人民的同情都在我们这方面。我们一定胜利！
