    Medical Workers Should Not Neglect Reading Newspapers
    Editor's Note: The editorial department of this newspaper has successively received letters from readers Yuan Zheng, Zhao Yingshi and others criticizing Peking Union Medical College and Beijing Third Hospital for neglecting newspaper reading. This has drawn our attention to the newspaper reading situation of cadres and staff in various regions and departments. First of all, we intend to initially understand the situation of medical workers reading newspapers based on these letters. We dispatched reporters to Beijing Hospital, Peking University Hospital, and Central People's Hospital for investigation and found that the neglect of newspaper reading by medical workers is very serious.
    According to the investigation: Very few people in the above-mentioned hospitals read newspapers regularly and carefully; the vast majority of people "read the newspaper when they come across it, and forget about it when they don't"; and some people don't read newspapers at all. Taking the outpatient department of Beijing Hospital as an example: among more than fifty staff members, one-fifth do not read newspapers at all, and only six read them relatively carefully. Peking University Hospital has a total of 432 doctors, nurses, and staff members with reading ability, of which only 17 percent read newspapers relatively carefully, 49 percent do not read newspapers at all, and the rest only look at the headlines on the front page. Therefore, many people lack the necessary understanding of the vigorous anti-corruption, anti-theft movement.
    Neglecting politics is an important reason why some medical workers neglect reading newspapers. However, many staff members have increasingly improved their political awareness, and they demand to read newspapers but have not received the necessary help and guidance. Therefore, the responsibility for causing the above-mentioned phenomenon and the failure to correct this phenomenon in time lies with the leadership. Some leaders do not realize that our newspapers are an important weapon for propagating Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to guide practical struggles, and are propagandists, mobilizers, and organizers for the broad masses; they do not realize that organizing the masses to read newspapers is the most basic propaganda and education work, and is one of the keys to whether the correct policies of our Party and the People's Government can be implemented among the masses. Therefore, they have not earnestly led the staff to read newspapers. In addition, the administration cannot
    provide staff with the necessary number of newspapers. For example, Peking University Hospital has nearly 1,000 staff members and patients, but only 25 newspapers, which is also a reason why the mass newspaper reading work has not been carried out.
    In order to quickly correct the serious phenomenon of medical workers neglecting newspaper reading, it is hoped that the relevant leaders will pay attention to this issue, immediately conduct an in-depth inspection of the newspaper reading situation in their units, and start to establish newspaper reading and learning systems and organizations suitable for the needs of the masses, and adopt various methods to enlighten and cultivate the masses' enthusiasm for reading newspapers, and improve the masses' political understanding. It is hoped that the leading cadres and political workers of various agencies will frequently write to us about the inspection and improvement of newspaper reading work. Many people at Peking Union Medical College do not read newspapers
    Some nurses have time to raise birds and listen to records, but "don't have time to read newspapers"
    Comrade Editor: Our motherland is now carrying out the great Resist America, Aid Korea, Increase Production and Practice Economy, and "Three-Anti" movements, but many people do not care about these things, and they often do not read newspapers. Some people at Peking Union Medical College are like this. We feel it is necessary to expose this situation in order to correct it in time.
    We have initially investigated the newspaper reading situation of our hospital staff: among more than 300 people (including professors, doctors, nurses, and assistants), 142 people read newspapers, but many of them only look at the headlines and that's it; 145 people either read or don't read newspapers, or basically don't read newspapers; and 21 people don't read newspapers at all. In general, about one-half of the people basically do not read newspapers. This number is really alarming. The Peking Union Medical College library does not even subscribe to a single copy of the People's Daily.
    Many people's "reason" for not reading newspapers is "too busy with work." Some nurses say: "I work eight hours a day and I'm very tired. I have to hurry back to rest," so I don't have time to read newspapers. In fact, after work, they raise birds, listen to records, and think about what style of clothes to make, their heads are full of enjoyment thoughts. Nurse Jiang Yiqian said in her self-criticism: "At Peking Union Medical College, not only can I learn specialized skills and be high above in the future, but I can also live a superior life, with exquisite food and accommodation, and everything is Westernized." Some nurses also have a fairly serious mercenary view, and they don't care about national affairs at all. What they are thinking about all day long is that you give me money, and I will work on time, and after work, I will rush back to see my children. Some professors and doctors only know how to study their academic works and run around the wards all day long, and are indifferent to foreign affairs. Individual professors think it is troublesome to participate in study groups. They say, anyway, I am also serving the people, why bother reading newspapers and studying politics. Last semester, when students asked to allocate a certain amount of time to study politics, the professors actually did not accept this suggestion, and there was not a minute of political study time on the curriculum.
    This extreme disregard for reading newspapers and neglecting politics has led to the backward political situation at Peking Union Medical College. In the "Three-Anti" movement, some small and medium-sized embezzlers did not pay attention to policies because they usually did not read newspapers, and their ideological concerns could not be resolved in time. Some people do not even know what the "Five-Anti" is. More seriously, even after the enemy's inhumane bacteriological warfare was announced in the newspapers for two days, a few people at Peking Union Medical College still did not know about it. How can these medical workers better serve the broad masses of the people?
    Of course, it is undeniable that since liberation, especially since the takeover, under the direct leadership of the Party and the People's Government, Peking Union Medical College has made many progress. In the ideological remolding and "Three-Anti" movement, many people are also undergoing a transformation, and their political awareness has been significantly improved. More than 1,000 people have signed up to participate in the anti-bacterial warfare and epidemic prevention work. However, we believe that this is not enough. We hope that those medical workers who do not care about national affairs can better correct this shortcoming, pay attention to the people's own newspapers, study Mao Zedong Thought, and more firmly establish the position of serving the people, so as to be able to undertake the great task of national construction.

    Many staff members of Beijing Third Hospital do not know about the "Kikayev Incident"
    Comrade Editor: Most of the staff of Beijing Third Hospital do not pay attention to current affairs study. This situation is particularly serious among nurses. According to our recent understanding: about 40 percent of the nurses do not read newspapers at all, and even if others read newspapers, they just glance at the headlines; very few people read newspapers regularly and carefully. Therefore, they know very little about current national affairs, or are completely ignorant. For example: the newspapers have revealed many facts about the bourgeoisie's organized attack on us, but many people do not know these facts; for example: the "Kikayev Incident," which is relatively closely related to our medical workers, is unknown to almost everyone.
    I asked them why they don't read newspapers. Most people emphasize that they are too busy. But I don't think this is the main reason. The main reason is that they don't care about politics. We once asked a female comrade to tell us the sequence of what she did all day long. She even mentioned things like getting up, eating, and sewing and mending after work, but she didn't mention that she should read the newspaper every day. She said: "The day passes quickly, who has time to read the newspaper?" From her conversation, we know that she still has some old ideas, thinking that washing and sewing are the main work of women, and has not realized that women today should actively participate in the great construction of the motherland like men. There are also individuals who say that not reading newspapers and not caring about national affairs is "noble," which is such an ignorant statement!
    Not caring about current affairs study is indeed a very common phenomenon among medical workers. We suggest that the medical workers' union and relevant administrative leaders pay attention to this issue. In order to ensure learning, we hope that everyone will establish a regular newspaper reading system and organization, hold current affairs symposiums regularly, and use current affairs quiz methods to inspire everyone's enthusiasm for reading newspapers.

### 医务工作者不应该忽视读报

专栏：读者来信

    医务工作者不应该忽视读报
    编者按：本报编辑部曾先后接到了读者袁政、赵应时等同志批评协和医学院及北京市第三医院忽视读报工作的来信。这引起了我们对于各地区、各部门干部和工作人员读报情形的注意。首先，我们拟根据这几封来信初步地了解医务工作者读报的情况。我们派遣记者到北京医院、北大医院及中央人民医院作了调查，发现医务工作者忽视读报的情况是很严重的。
    据调查：上述各医院经常认真读报的人很少；绝大多数的人都是“碰着报纸就看，碰不着就算了”；还有一部分人是根本不读报。以北京医院门诊部为例：在五十多个工作人员中，根本不看报的占五分之一，比较认真读报的只有六人。北大医院共有四百三十二个有阅读能力的医生、护士和职员，其中比较认真读报的只占百分之十七，根本不读报的占百分之四十九，其余的人只是看看一版上的大标题。因此，很多人就连对于轰轰烈烈的反贪污、反盗窃运动，也缺乏应有的认识。
    忽视政治是使某些医务工作人员忽视读报的重要原因。但是有许多工作人员政治觉悟日渐提高，他们要求读报却没有得到必要的帮助和指导。因此，造成上述现象和这种现象未能及时得到纠正的责任则在领导方面。有些领导人没有认识到我们的报纸是宣传马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想以指导实际斗争的重要武器，是广大群众的宣传者鼓动者和组织者；他们没有认识到组织群众读报是最基本的宣传教育工作，是我们的党和人民政府的正确政策能否在群众中贯彻实现的关键之一。因此，他们就没有认真地领导工作人员进行读报。此外，行政方面不能
    供给工作人员以必要数量的报纸，如北大医院共有工作人员和病员近一千人，只有二十五份报纸，这也是群众读报工作没有开展的一个原因。
    为了迅速纠正医务工作者忽视读报的严重现象，希望有关领导方面重视这个问题，立即深入检查本单位的读报情况，并着手建立适合群众需要的读报学习制度和组织，采用各种方法，启发和培养群众的读报热情，提高群众的政治认识。希望各机关的领导干部和政治工作人员把检查和改进读报工作的情况，经常写信告诉我们。协和医学院有许多人不看报
    有些护士有时间养小鸟、听唱片，却“没有时间看报”
    编辑同志：我们祖国现在正在进行着伟大的抗美援朝、增产节约和“三反”运动，但有很多人却不关心这些事情，他们经常不看报纸。协和医学院有一部分人就是这样。我们觉得有必要把这种情况揭发出来，以便及时纠正。
    我们初步调查了我院工作人员读报的情况：在三百多人中（包括教授、大夫、护士、助理员），有一百四十二人是读报的，但其中许多人只看看大标题就完了；有一百四十五人是可读可不读或基本上不读报的；还有二十一人则是根本不读报。总的说来，约有二分之一的人是基本上不读报的。这个数字实在惊人。协和图书馆甚至连一份人民日报都不订。
    许多人不看报的“理由”是“工作太忙”。有的护士说：“一天工作八小时，累得很，还要赶快回去休息一下”，因此没有时间看报。实际上她们下班后，却是养小鸟、听唱片，想法做些什么样式的衣服，一脑袋装满了享受思想。护士蒋以谦检讨时说：“在协和不但能够学到专门技术，将来可以高高在上，同时也可以生活优越，吃住讲究，一切洋化。”还有的护士存在着相当严重的雇佣观点，根本就不关心国家大事。她们整天盘算的是你给我钱，我给你按时上班工作，下班以后，赶着回去看看孩子。有些教授、大夫们只晓得整天研究他的学术著作、跑病房，对于外事不闻不问。个别教授对参加学习小组，认为是麻烦事。他们说，反正我也是为人民服务，何必读报纸，学政治。上学期，当学生们要求分出一定时间学习政治的时候，教授们竟然不接受这一意见，课程表上没有规定一分钟的政治学习时间。
    这种极端不重视读报，忽视政治的现象，造成了协和医学院政治上的落后状况。在“三反”运动中，有的中小贪污分子就因为平常不看报，不注意政策，思想顾虑不能及时解除。还有的人连“五反”是什么都不知道。更严重的是，敌人灭绝人性地发动的细菌战在报上公布了两天以后，协和竟然还有少数的人不知道。像这些医务工作者们，怎么能够更好地为广大的人民服务呢？
    当然，不可否认的，解放以后，特别是接管以来，在党和人民政府的直接领导下，协和已经有了许多的进步。在思想改造和“三反”运动中，许多人也正在脱胎换骨，政治觉悟有了显著的提高，报名参加反细菌战防疫工作的人已超过一千人。但是我们认为这是不够的，我们希望那些不关心国事的医务工作者能够更好地改正这一缺点，重视人民自己的报纸，学习毛泽东思想，更坚定为人民服务的立场，才能担负起祖国建设的伟大任务。

    北京市第三医院许多工作人员不知道“纪凯夫事件”
    编辑同志：北京市第三医院大部分工作人员不重视时事学习。这种情况在护士中特别严重。据我们最近了解：大约有百分之四十的护士根本不读报，其他的人即使读报，也只是走马看花地看看大标题；经常认真读报的人是很少的。因此，他（她）们对当前的国家大事知道得很少，或根本无知。比如：报纸上揭露了很多资产阶级向我们有组织地进攻的事实，但许多人却不知道这些事实；又如：与我们医务工作者关系比较密切的“纪凯夫事件”，几乎所有的人都不知道。
    我问他（她）们为什么不看报，一般的人都强调自己太忙。但我认为这不是主要的原因，主要原因是自己不关心政治。我们曾请一位女同志把她一天到晚所干的事情顺序讲了一遍，她连起床、吃饭、下班后缝缝补补的事情都说了，就是没有说到她每天应该读报。她说：“一天很快就过了，谁顾得上读报？”从她的谈话里，我们知道她还有些旧思想，认为洗洗缝缝是女人的主要工作，没有认识到女人在今天应该和男人一样地来积极参加祖国的伟大建设。还有个别人说，不读报，不关心国家大事是“清高”，这是一种多么无知的说法！
    对时事学习不关心，在医务工作者中间确实是很普遍的现象。我们建议医务工作者工会和有关行政领导方面，重视这一问题。为保证学习，我们希望大家建立经常性的读报制度和组织，定时召开时事座谈会，并利用时事测验的方法来启发大家读报的积极性。
