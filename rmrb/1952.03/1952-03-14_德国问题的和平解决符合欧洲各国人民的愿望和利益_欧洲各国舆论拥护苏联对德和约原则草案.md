    The Soviet Union's note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of a German peace treaty, as well as the Soviet draft principles for a German peace treaty, have aroused great attention in public opinion in European countries.

    The newspapers of the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe warmly support the Soviet note. The Polish "People's Tribune" said: The Soviet note is a prominent new factor in the struggle for peace. It is very clear that if Germany can be unified within the borders stipulated by the Potsdam Agreement into an independent, peaceful, and democratic country, the threat of a new war in Europe will be eliminated. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet Union, with the support of all progressive humanity, has consistently striven for the unification of Germany. The "People's Tribune" emphasized the extreme importance of the Soviet draft principles for a German peace treaty, and pointed out: Concluding a peace treaty fully conforms to the vital interests of the Polish and Western European people, and also conforms to the interests of the German nation.

    The Romanian "Spark" published an editorial saying: This recently published Soviet document demonstrates the full wisdom of Stalin's diplomatic policy and the Soviet Union's deep understanding of the needs and desires of the German people. "The Romanian people welcome the Soviet government's proposal for a German peace treaty with deep satisfaction and will do their best to make it a reality."

    The Bulgarian "Free People's News" said: The Soviet proposal is a new and important step taken by the Soviet government to solve one of the most pressing problems of the German people. The Soviet draft fully conforms to the Soviet Union's consistent policy towards Germany, a policy that conforms to the principles of the Potsdam Agreement.

    In Western Europe, the Soviet proposal has also received widespread attention. French newspapers widely published and commented on the Soviet proposal, pointing out its great importance. "L'Humanité's" international editor, Gutard, published an article saying: "The peaceful resolution of the German question is a decisive contribution to the work of maintaining world peace. The peaceful resolution of the German question is what the people yearn for, especially – as the Soviet note emphasizes – the people of the countries adjacent to Germany who suffered terribly under Hitler's aggression." The progressive newspaper "Liberation" published a commentary written by Hermann, president of the International Association of Journalists, which said: A neutral Germany with a limited and controlled arms program, a democratic regime, and fixed borders can guarantee peace.

    Even the opinions of the French bourgeoisie admit that the Soviet proposal cannot be ignored. "Combat" said: "The Soviet note puts forward a basis for discussion, and the Western countries have no right or ability to refuse it without studying it." Although "Le Populaire" and "Le Figaro" tried to defend the attitude taken by the reactionaries towards the Soviet proposal, they had to admit that the Soviet proposal could not be rejected rashly.

    Although the British bourgeois newspapers pretended to be indifferent to the Soviet note, they could not help but publish it as important news.

    德国问题的和平解决符合欧洲各国人民的愿望和利益
    欧洲各国舆论拥护苏联对德和约原则草案
    【新华社十三日讯】苏联就对德和约问题致美、英、法三国政府的照会以及苏联的对德和约原则草案，引起欧洲各国舆论的极大重视。
    东欧人民民主国家的报纸热烈拥护苏联的照会。波兰“人民论坛报”说：苏联的照会是和平斗争中一个突出的新因素。非常明显，如果德国能在波茨坦协定所规定的疆界内统一成为独立、和平和民主的国家，欧洲新战争的威胁就会消除。正是因为这样，所以苏联才在全体进步人类的支持之下一贯地为争取德国的统一而奋斗。“人民论坛报”强调苏联的对德和约原则草案的极度重要性，并指出：缔结和约完全符合波兰和西欧人民的切身利益，同时也符合德国民族的利益。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”发表社论说：这个最近发表的苏联文件，表明了斯大林外交政策充分的英明和苏联对于德国人民的需要与愿望的深切了解。“罗马尼亚人民抱着深切满意的心情，欢迎苏联政府关于对德和约的建议，并将尽力使它实现。”
    保加利亚“自由人民报”说：苏联建议是苏联政府为解决德国人民的一个最迫切问题而采取的新的重要步骤。苏联的草案充分符合苏联一贯奉行的对德政策，这个政策是符合波茨坦协定的原则的政策。
    在西欧，苏联的建议也受到广泛重视。法国各报广泛刊载和评论苏联的建议，指出这个建议的巨大重要性。“人道报”的国际编辑古达德发表文章说：“德国问题的和平解决对于维持世界和平的工作，是一个具有决定性的贡献。德国问题的和平解决是人民所切盼的，特别是——正如苏联照会所着重指出的——在希特勒的侵略下受灾惨重的与德国毗邻的各国的人民所切盼的。”进步报纸“解放报”发表了国际新闻记者协会主席赫尔曼所写的一篇评论，这篇评论说：一个有着有限度而受管制的军备计划、有着民主的政权和固定的疆界的中立的德国，能保证和平。
    连法国资产阶级的言论也承认苏联的建议不可忽视。“战斗报”说：“苏联的照会提出了一个讨论的基础，西方国家如果不加以研究，是无权也无法予以拒绝的。”“人民报”和“费加罗报”虽然设法为反动派对苏联的建议所采取的态度辩解，也不得不承认：苏联的建议不可率尔予以拒绝。
    英国资产阶级的报纸对苏联的照会虽故作冷淡，也不能不作为重要新闻加以刊载。
