    Certain Cadres' Erroneous Ideas Should Be Corrected in the Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Movement

    Editor,

    In some areas of South China, including parts of Guangzhou, some cadres have an erroneous idea that hinders the development of the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement. They feel that the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement is too tense and troublesome, with meetings during the day and meetings at night, struggle sessions here and struggle sessions there. Their erroneous thinking creates opportunities for "releasing tigers back to the mountains" and allowing bad elements who steal state property to slip through the net. Because corrupt elements hope the movement will end quickly. Yang Qin, a corrupt element at the Guangzhou Workers' Hospital, initially said he had only formed an "offensive and defensive alliance" with three stores. After struggle, he then said he had formed an "offensive and defensive alliance" with seven stores. Only after continued struggle against him did he confess to forming an "offensive and defensive alliance" with ten stores. If we don't carry out a resolute struggle against corrupt elements, this corrupt element, for example, would not further confess his problems. Another example is Zhu Jingwen, deputy director of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, who initially said he had embezzled 3,000 Hong Kong dollars. Later, when he saw that the anti-corruption movement was prolonged and that he had to confess, he then confessed to embezzling 7 million RMB and stealing state-owned gasoline and other wrongdoings. He himself said that Chairman Mao had said that the anti-corruption movement would not end until complete victory was achieved. After thinking about it, he confessed to his embezzlement. Bao Xiong, the business section chief of the Beijiang branch of the Guangdong Provincial Grain Company, a major corrupt element, confessed to the crime of illegally selling grain worth nearly 500 million yuan, but withheld the crime of accepting bribes from unscrupulous merchants and selling grain intelligence. Because his confession was not thorough, Luo Ming, the secretary of the Youth League branch of the Beijiang Trading Company, and Bao Hua, the principal of Shaozhou Normal School, who were related to his corruption, attempted to deny it, hoping that the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement would end quickly so they could escape this ordeal. Based on these facts, I hope that all regions will pay attention to correcting the right-leaning thinking of cadres who feel impatient with the movement, persist in the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement, and truly achieve the goal of not ending until complete victory is achieved.

### 在反贪污、反行贿运动中应纠正某些干部的错误思想

    在反贪污、反行贿运动中应纠正某些干部的错误思想
    编辑同志：华南某些地区包括广州的部分机关干部，存在着一种错误思想，妨碍反贪污、反行贿运动的开展。他们觉得在反贪污、反行贿运动中，白天开会，晚上也开会，这里开斗争会，那里又开斗争会，太紧张，太麻烦。他们的错误思想，造成了“放虎归山”、使盗窃国家财产的坏分子漏网的机会。因为贪污分子是希望运动赶快结束的。广州市工人医院的贪污分子杨勤，最初只说和三个商店订立了“攻守同盟”，经过斗争，又说出和七个商店订立了“攻守同盟”，对他继续进行斗争后，他才说出和十个商店订立了“攻守同盟”。如果对贪污分子不进行坚决的斗争，像这个贪污分子，就不会进一步交代他的问题。又如广州市总工会副主任朱敬文，最初只说贪污了三千元港币，后来他看到反贪污运动的时间延长了，不交代不行了，才又坦白了贪污七百万元人民币和盗窃国家电油等错误。他自己说，毛主席说过反贪污运动不获全胜不收兵，想来想去，才说了自己的贪污事实。广东省粮食公司北江分公司的业务股长、大贪污犯包雄，坦白了盗卖粮食价值近五亿元的罪行，但是保留了接受奸商贿赂、出卖粮食情报的罪行。由于他坦白不彻底，和他贪污有关的北江贸易公司青年团支部书记罗明及韶州师范学校校长包华就企图抵赖，希望反贪污、反行贿运动赶快结束，以逃过这一关。根据以上这些事实，我希望各地注意纠正干部中对运动感觉不耐烦的右倾思想，把反贪污、反行贿运动坚持下去，真正作到不获全胜，决不收兵。
