There is a kind of shameless scoundrel in the world, who resorts to rogue tactics when defeated in battle; who doesn't blush when proven wrong in argument, but feigns composure while secretly plotting sabotage: poisoning your water tank, setting fire to your thatched roof, but refusing to admit it.

American imperialism is such a thing. In more than twenty months of the Korean War, it has been beaten to a pulp, suffering more than 500,000 casualties, losing more than 3,400 aircraft (according to statistics since the Chinese People's Volunteers entered the war), and suffering financial and material losses that are almost incalculable, but it refuses to admit defeat. At the United Nations meetings and in the Panmunjom negotiations, it was scolded relentlessly, unable to utter a word in response, but it still brazenly acted as if nothing had happened. "I don't care about anything, I have 'advantages'!" According to the logic of American imperialism, the advantage should always be on its side. Although the advantage of naval and air power is gone, and the advantage of atomic bombs is gone, with the help of Japanese and German fascist bacteriological warfare criminals, and through the use of prisoners of war as living test subjects, it has acquired the "advantage" of poisonous creatures such as fleas, black flies, spiders, and rats, and it went mad: hundreds of planes sneaked into the skies over North Korea to drop them, sneaked into the skies over our Northeast to drop them, sneaked into the skies over the Shandong coast to drop them, and even dropped them in the neutral area of Panmunjom. It is, on the one hand, conducting large-scale germ warfare; on the other hand, it is "having a guilty conscience" and stubbornly denying it: "I didn't do it, the germ bombs in your area were not dropped by me." But when its inferior pilots dropped germ bombs on their own camps, when "many flies and fleas were found on the mountains on the side of the 'United Nations forces' themselves," it panicked, just like when Truman said last year that he would drop atomic bombs, which frightened the Washington wealthy into rushing to move their homes.

Let me tell you: the wheels of history have carried imperialism onto the road to death. Aircraft, cannons, and atomic bombs cannot save you, so how can fleas, black flies, spiders, and rats save you? Under the angry and righteous condemnation of the people of the world, and under the heroic fighting of the Chinese and Korean people, we not only have the power to eliminate the poisons you have dropped and defeat your germ warfare, but also have the power to eliminate you like fleas, black flies, spiders, and rats.

    放毒犯
    谢觉哉
    世界上有一种无耻的孬种，打输了，耍无赖；说输了，不红脸，外装镇静，暗下毒手：在你的水缸里放毒，在你的茅檐下点火，但他却死不认账。
    美帝国主义就是这样的东西，二十多个月的侵朝战争，被打得落花流水，人员损失五十多万，飞机损失三千四百多架（志愿军出国作战以来的统计），金钱物质的损失几无法计算，但它却死不认输。在联合国会议上，在板门店谈判中，被骂得狗血淋头，一句嘴也无法回，但它仍硬着头皮，若无其事。“什么我都不管，我有‘优势’！”照美帝国主义的逻辑，优势应永远在它那一边。虽然海空军的优势没有了，原子弹的优势也没有了，但经过日德法西斯细菌战犯的帮助，经过以战俘作活人试验，它又拥有了跳蚤、黑蝇、蜘蛛、老鼠等毒物的“优势”，于是它发狂了：百十架的飞机，窜入北朝鲜上空丢，窜入我国的东北上空丢，山东沿海的上空丢，甚至在板门店的中立地区上空也丢。它，一方大规模进行细菌战；一方又“做贼心虚”，死抵赖：“我没有，你那里的细菌弹，不是我丢的”。但当它的劣等飞行员把细菌弹丢在自己阵营时，在“联军部队自己这一边的山上发现许多苍蝇与跳蚤”时，它慌了张，正像去年杜鲁门说要丢原子弹，骇得华盛顿富豪忙着搬家一样。
    告诉你：历史的车轮已把帝国主义载往死亡道上，飞机大炮原子弹挽救不了你们，跳蚤、黑蝇、蜘蛛、老鼠又怎能把你们挽救？在全世界人民愤怒的正义斥责下，在中朝人民的英勇战斗下，我们不只有力量消灭你们丢下的毒物，战胜你们的细菌战，而且有力量把你们像跳蚤、黑蝇、蜘蛛、老鼠等毒物一样消灭掉。
