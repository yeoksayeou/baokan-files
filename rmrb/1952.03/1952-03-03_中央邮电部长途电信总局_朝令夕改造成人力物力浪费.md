    Central Post and Telecommunications Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau's Arbitrary Changes Cause Waste of Manpower and Resources
    To the Editor: On December 28th of last year, our bureau received a telegram from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government, issued on the 27th. This telegram notified us of adjustments to long-distance telecommunications rates, effective from January 1, 1952. Due to the short notice, all the personnel in our long-distance telephone business office worked very nervously, fearing they would not be able to complete the task. Everyone volunteered to work overtime for six hours that night. By the afternoon of the 29th, we had completed all the procedures, when suddenly we received a telegram from the Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, changing the method of calculating cancellation fees. This was partially different from the prices we had already calculated. The time was even shorter. On the evening of the 29th, most of our staff extended their working hours, redoing the work we had already done for two days. The 30th was a Sunday, and we continued to work overtime, calculating comparison tables, price lists, and cutting stencils. However, on the afternoon of the 31st, the East China Post and Telecommunications Administration called and said: "The Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau has notified us that a certain base price in the former North China area needs to be revised." This price was completely different from what we had originally calculated. This arbitrary working style of the Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications caused us to waste forty-one work-hours. This irresponsible working style has caused a huge waste of manpower and resources. It should be corrected immediately.

    Editor's Note: The Central People's Government's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau sent a letter acknowledging that the reader's comments are correct. They are willing to accept this lesson and improve their work in the future.

    中央邮电部长途电信总局
    朝令夕改造成人力物力浪费
    编辑同志：去年十二月二十八日，我局接到中央人民政府邮电部二十七日所发的电报，这个电报通知，自一九五二年元旦日起，调整长途电信资费。因时间仓促，我们长途电话营业室全体人员都十分紧张地工作，恐不能完成任务。大家在当夜义务加班六小时。二十九日下午，我们把一切手续办妥了，突然接到邮电部长途电信总局的电报，变更销号费的计收办法。这和我们已经算好的价目有部分不同。时间更仓促了。二十九日晚，我们大部分人员延长工作时间，重做两天来已经做过的工作。三十日是星期日，我们仍继续加班，计算对照表、价目表并刻蜡纸等。但是，三十一日下午，华东邮电管理局来电话说：“长途电信总局通知原华北区的某基价要修改”。这个价目和我们原来算的又完全不同。邮电部长途电信总局这种朝令夕改的工作作风，使我们浪费了四十一个工时。这种不负责任的工作作风，造成了人力、物力的巨大浪费。应该立即纠正。
