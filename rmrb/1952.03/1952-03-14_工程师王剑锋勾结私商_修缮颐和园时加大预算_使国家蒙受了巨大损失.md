    Engineer Wang Jianfeng Colludes with Private Merchants
    Increases Budget During Summer Palace Renovation, Causing Huge Losses to the State
    Editor: Engineer Wang Jianfeng of the Beijing Municipal Parks Administration, in the Summer Palace renovation project, colluded with private merchants, increased the budget, and engaged in cutting corners and other malpractices, causing huge losses to the state.

    In 1951, the Summer Palace renovation projects of the Revolving Sutra Repository, the Building Facing the Flowers, the Picture Gallery, and the Stone Boat were all handled by Wang Jianfeng, who was responsible for surveying, designing, and preparing the budget, and he handed them over to the private Tianzeng Construction Company for construction. During the construction period, he sided completely with the private merchants, adding fees for extra work but not reducing costs for reduced work. He also did not pay attention to controlling materials (the private merchants were contracted for labor only, not materials), and he added the budget three times. The total budget for these four projects was over 310 million yuan, but the actual labor costs used by the private merchants were only over 180 million yuan.

    The renovation project of the Seven Arch Bridge was also handled by Wang Jianfeng alone, and he handed it over to the private Jianguo Construction Company for contracting. The budget for this project was over 65 million yuan, while the actual labor costs used were only over 27 million yuan. After the completion of the project, Wang Jianfeng did not carry out inspection in accordance with the provisions of the contract, so it was later discovered that many parts of the project did not conform to the provisions of the contract.

    When repairing the Seventeen-Arch Bridge and the Hall of Gathering Excellence, Wang Jianfeng approved a budget of 130 million yuan for the Seventeen-Arch Bridge and a budget of 30.08 million yuan for the Hall of Gathering Excellence, and he prepared to hand over this renovation project to Tianzeng Construction Company. Considering that the private merchants had made huge profits from the previous renovation projects and that the projects were not well-built, the workers of our garden requested to repair them ourselves. After repeated requests, the higher authorities finally approved the self-repair. As a result, the repair of the Seventeen-Arch Bridge only cost over 30 million yuan, saving about 100 million yuan compared to the original budget; the repair of the Hall of Gathering Excellence only cost over 12 million yuan, saving 18.03 million yuan compared to the original budget.

    The above facts prove that Wang Jianfeng colluded with private merchants and deliberately fabricated huge budgets to defraud the state of its assets. We hope that the relevant authorities will conduct a strict investigation of him.

    工程师王剑锋勾结私商
    修缮颐和园时加大预算  使国家蒙受了巨大损失
    编辑同志：北京市公园管理委员会工程师王剑锋在颐和园修缮工程中，勾结私商，加大预算、偷工舞弊，使国家蒙受巨大损失。
    一九五一年，颐和园修缮转轮藏、敷华亭、画中游、石舫四项工程，是由王剑锋一手包揽勘查、设计、编造预算的，并由他交给私商天增营造厂承修。在施工期间，他完全站在私商方面，加工就加费，减工却不减钱。他又不注意掌握材料（私商承修这项工程是包工不包料的），曾追加三次预算。这四项工程的预算共三亿一千多万元，但私商实用工款只一亿八千多万元。
    七处桥的修缮工程，也是王剑锋一手包办，由他交给私商建国营造厂包修的。这项工程的预算是六千五百多万元，而实用工款只两千七百多万元。工程完竣之后，王剑锋没有按照合同的规定进行检验，因此后来发现有很多处工程是和合同的规定不符的。
    在修缮十七孔桥和撷秀亭时，王剑锋核准十七孔桥预算一亿三千万元，撷秀亭预算三亿零八百多万元，并准备把这项修缮工程交由天增营造厂承修。我园工人鉴于以前的几项修缮工程，都被私商从中获取暴利，而且工程做得不结实；因此要求自己修缮。经过再三的声请，上级终于准予自修。结果，修十七孔桥只用了三千多万元，比原来预算节省约
    一亿元；修撷秀亭只用了一亿二千多万元，比原来预算节省一亿八千三百多万元。
    以上事实证明，王剑锋是勾结私商、有意伪造庞大预算骗取国家资财的。我们希望有关机关对他进行严格的检查。
