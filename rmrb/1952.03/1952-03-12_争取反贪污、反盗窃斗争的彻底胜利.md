The Central People's Government's Government Administration Council has promulgated two documents: the Central Committee for the Practice of Economy and Inspection's "Several Provisions on Handling Corruption, Waste, and Overcoming Bureaucratic Errors" and the Beijing Municipal People's Government's "Standards and Measures for Classifying and Handling Industrial and Commercial Households in the 'Five-Anti' Movement." These two documents provide us with powerful weapons to swiftly and thoroughly deal with all acts of corruption and theft that violate the interests of the state and the people, as well as serious errors committed by state personnel in their work. They will enable the people of the whole country to unite more closely, defeat the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

According to these two documents, we will correctly handle all corrupt elements and thieves, adhering to the principle of combining severity with leniency and combining reform with punishment. This will inevitably further expand and consolidate the victorious achievements of the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle, severely isolate and strike at those stubborn and unrepentant corrupt elements and thieves, thereby creating an extremely favorable situation for the future anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle.

The anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle has now achieved a great victory throughout the country. Large numbers of corrupt elements and thieves are being ferreted out or confessing voluntarily every day from various regions and units. The methods of corruption and theft by criminals are being exposed from all sides every day. People are increasingly convinced that corrupt elements and thieves can be completely eradicated, and that their most solid fortresses and defenses can be completely destroyed. "We will not withdraw our troops until we achieve a complete victory" has become the battle cry of the broad masses. This high-spirited fighting will and determination to eliminate evil, coupled with the two documents we now have as weapons, will guarantee that we can search out all corrupt elements and thieves, and deal with them separately according to the law.

At present, some corrupt elements and thieves have organized what they believe to be very solid "alliances for offense and defense," feeling that their criminal acts will never be discovered again. Therefore, they adopt a resolute attitude of denial towards the inspection by the Party and the People's Government and the accusations by the masses; or, after admitting some minor matters, they swear and pledge to ensure that "there is absolutely nothing else"; still others take the opportunity to go back on their confessions after having confessed. The criminal masterminds of these "alliances for offense and defense" constantly fabricate various vile lies to deceive their criminal accomplices, making their accomplices afraid to take the path of confession. They fabricate sayings such as: "Confession means certain death, non-confession may mean survival"; "Sentence reduction or exemption for voluntary confession is only a typical demonstration, not universally applicable"; "Thorough confession is also useless, others will not believe that your crimes are only so many"; "Confession followed by insufficient return of stolen goods still leads to death," and so on. When the firepower of the mass struggle is very intense, they use methods of "giving stimulants" to stabilize their accomplices, saying: "The higher-ups have already ordered a shift to production, the struggle will pass soon. As long as you don't admit it, you will never be convicted." They fantasize and say: "There will inevitably be a correction of deviations and a counter-left after the anti-right. At that time, all cases will be dropped. What cadres are they still are." They regard the occurrence of certain deviations in the struggle of individual units as good news, preparing to counterattack. When some people cannot resist the conclusive evidence of witnesses and material evidence and want to confess, the criminal masterminds even threaten these people with "shooting black guns," so that they dare at most only admit their own crimes and do not dare to expose the crimes of others.

All these conspiracies of the corrupt elements and thieves are now even more destined to fail. We have these two documents as powerful weapons, and as long as we continue to fully utilize and develop the rich experience of calculating big accounts, calculating detailed accounts, investigating life, investigating history, and investigating relationships, investigate and collect sufficient materials from all aspects, and strengthen the work of corroborating the time, place, people, methods, amount, and whereabouts of the stolen money, we will surely be able to powerfully smash the conspiracy of those who "recant," making the criminals' conspiracies unable to succeed. We should seriously warn all corrupt elements and thieves, especially the criminal masterminds of the "alliances for offense and defense": your hope that the movement will be like a gust of wind, quickly passing, and even letting you return to your original positions to continue doing evil, is a foolish delusion, which is due to your complete ignorance of the struggle situation, the leadership's determination, and the masses' emotions! The purpose of our current struggle is to consolidate the working class's leadership over state power and economic undertakings, and to further lay the foundation for increasing production and practicing economy and carrying out large-scale economic construction; we want to vigorously restore and develop normal social and economic life. But in order to make the economic activities of the people of the whole country develop more rapidly, in order to prevent the fruits of production from being stolen, in order to prevent the labor of hundreds of millions of people from being wasted, people must search out all corrupt elements and thieves, and eliminate all corrupt and theft activities that endanger the interests of the state and the people. Therefore, no matter how tense production and labor are, no matter how much manpower is involved, the struggle must be thoroughly achieved to complete victory. In fact, many units are now carrying out production on the one hand and carrying out the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle on the other. Some units have even exceeded the plan in production during the extremely tense struggle. The criminals should re-recognize the infinite power of the awakened people's masses.

It should be warned to the criminals: your belief that you cannot be convicted without a confession is that you have deceived yourself. We have never been like the Kuomintang reactionary government, which specializes in convicting solely based on confessions, but completely rely on investigation and research and conclusive evidence. Because of this, we strictly prohibit the use of any torture to force confessions. However, when we have conducted a careful investigation and grasped completely conclusive evidence, even without a confession, we can still convict, even to the point of sentencing to death. It is completely useless for criminals to try to deny it.

Some corrupt elements and thieves, based on narrow experience, use the method of historical analogy and arbitrarily say that there must be corrections and anti-left in the future, vainly attempting to engage in speculative activities of stealing the sky and changing the sun, which will never succeed. Policies are not in the hands of corrupt elements and thieves, but in the hands of the people's masses, in the hands of the Party and the working class. The people will not do things that are not beneficial to the people. The people are determined to search out all corrupt elements and thieves, and will never let them speculate and retaliate.

It should be warned to all criminals, especially the criminal masterminds of the "alliances for offense and defense": those who persist in evil and whose crimes are extremely heinous will be severely punished. Continuing to resist will only aggravate one's own crimes, and there can be no other result.

For the corrupt elements and thieves who have been deceived in the "alliance for offense and defense" and are still willing to confess, no matter whether they have been silenced in the past, have made a conclusion, whether the stolen money and goods have been used up, whether there are other difficulties in the recovery of stolen goods (such as debtors defaulting, etc.), as long as they are truly determined to confess and repent, their problems should be correctly resolved according to the provisions of the two documents promulgated by the Government Administration Council, and they should be given a way out. For those who confess thoroughly, they should be called upon to make amends for their crimes, and they should be treated leniently as soon as possible in accordance with the provisions of the two documents promulgated by the Government Administration Council, so that all kinds of lies will be self-defeating.

The Central Committee for the Practice of Economy and Inspection's "Several Provisions on Handling Corruption, Waste, and Overcoming Bureaucratic Errors" clearly stipulates: "Those with lighter circumstances or who thoroughly confess and atone for their crimes will be treated leniently; those with serious and vile circumstances who refuse to confess will be severely punished." The Beijing Municipal People's Government's "Standards and Measures for Classifying and Handling Industrial and Commercial Households" also adopted the basic principles of "leniency in the past, strictness in the future" and "leniency for confession, severity for resistance." Therefore, if all corrupt elements and thieves do not thoroughly confess and embark on the path of reform and self-renewal, and are finally found out, they will never be able to escape the severe punishment of the law.

Many corrupt elements and thieves are now doing everything possible to conduct activities, attempting to "find out the bottom line," inquire about the time of the movement, and inquire about the leadership's determination and the specific details of the policies. Now all the provisions of these two documents are our "bottom line." All those who are willing to win the victory of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, are willing to make the country's construction successful, are willing to let the new China move towards independence, prosperity and strength, and are willing to let the people move towards a bright and happy future, must correctly grasp these two documents as weapons, continue to adhere to the struggle, break the "alliance for offense and defense" of corrupt elements and thieves and all resistance, and strive for a thorough victory in the struggle against corruption and theft.

### 争取反贪污、反盗窃斗争的彻底胜利

    争取反贪污、反盗窃斗争的彻底胜利
    中央人民政府政务院公布了中央节约检查委员会关于处理贪污、浪费及克服官僚主义错误的若干规定和北京市人民政府在“五反”运动中关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法两个文件。这两个文件给了我们以有力的武器，便于我们迅速彻底地处理一切违反国家和人民利益的贪污、盗窃行为及国家工作人员在工作中所犯的严重错误，使全国人民更加团结，战胜资产阶级的猖狂进攻，巩固人民民主专政的制度。
    按照这两个文件，我们对于一切贪污分子和盗窃分子，都将按照严肃和宽大相结合、改造和惩办相结合的方针，分别予以正确的处理。这就必然会进一步扩大和巩固反贪污、反盗窃斗争的胜利成果，严重地孤立和打击了那些顽固不坦白的贪污盗窃分子，从而给今后的反贪污、反盗窃斗争造成了极为有利的形势。
    反贪污、反盗窃的斗争，现在已经在全国范围内取得了伟大的胜利。大批的贪污盗窃分子，每天从各地区、各单位被搜捕出来或自动坦白。罪犯们的贪污盗窃的方法，每天从各个方面被揭露出来。人们日益坚信：贪污盗窃分子是完全可以被肃清的，他们的任何坚固的堡垒和防线，都是完全可以被摧毁的。“不获全胜，决不收兵”已经成为广大群众的战斗口号。这种昂扬的斗志和除恶的决心，加上现在我们有了这两个文件为武器，将保证我们能够把一切贪污、盗窃分子搜捕净尽，依法予以分别处理。
    目前有一些贪污、盗窃分子组织了自认为很坚固的“攻守同盟”，就觉得自己的罪恶行为再也不会被发现了。于是对党和人民政府的检查及群众的检举抱了坚决抵赖的态度；或者是承认了一些小事之后，就发誓具结，保证“绝对没有了”；还有的是在坦白之后又借机翻案。这些“攻守同盟”的罪恶的主谋者不断地捏造出各种卑劣的谎言来欺骗他们犯罪的同伙，使他们的同伙不敢走坦白的路。他们捏造说：“坦白必死，不坦白或可不死”；“自动坦白者减刑免刑，只是典型示范，并非普遍适用”；
    “彻底坦白了也不行，别人不会相信你的罪恶就只这么多”；“坦白以后交不够赃物，还是死路一条”等等。在群众斗争火力十分强烈的时候，他们采用打“强心针”的办法来稳定他们的同伙，说：“上面已经下令要转向生产了，斗争马上就要过去了。只要你不承认，永远判不了罪。”他们异想天开地说：
    “反右之后必然要反左，纠偏。那时候，一切案件都将不了了之。什么干部还是什么干部。”他们把个别单位斗争中发生某些偏差当做福音，准备反扑。有些人在确凿的人证物证面前抵抗不住，想要坦白时，罪恶的主谋者甚至用“打黑枪”来威胁这些人，使他们顶多只敢承认自己的罪恶，不敢揭发别人的罪恶。
    贪污、盗窃分子的这一切阴谋，现在更加注定要失败了。我们有了这两个文件作为有力的武器，只要我们继续充分运用和发挥算大账、算细账、查生活、查历史、查关系等的丰富经验，从各方面调查、搜集充足的材料，加强对贪污盗窃的时间、地点、人物、方法、数目和赃款出路的对证工作，就
    一定能够有力地击破“翻供”者的阴谋，使罪犯们的阴谋不能得逞。我们应当严重地警告一切贪污盗窃分子，尤其是“攻守同盟”的罪恶主谋者：你们希望运动会像一阵风一样，很快刮了过去，甚至仍然让你们回到原来的位置上，继续作恶，那是愚蠢的妄想，那是由于你们对斗争形势、领导决心和群众情绪全然无知！我们当前斗争的目的，是在于巩固工人阶级对于国家政权和经济事业的领导权，进一步奠定增产节约和进行大规模经济建设的基础；我们是要大力恢复和发展正常的社会经济生活的。但是为了使全国人民的经济活动更迅速地发展起来，为了使生产的成果不致被偷窃，为了使亿万人民的劳动不致白费，人们就一定要搜尽一切贪污盗窃分子，铲除一切危害国家和人民利益的贪污盗窃行为。因此，不管生产劳动多么紧张，人力受到多少牵扯，斗争是必须彻底达到完全胜利的。事实上，现在许多单位就是一面进行生产，一面进行反贪污、反盗窃斗争的。有的单位甚至在极端紧张的斗争中，生产还超过了计划。罪犯们应该重新认识觉醒了的人民群众的无穷伟力。
    应当警告罪犯们：你们认为没有口供就不能判罪，那是你们自己骗了自己。我们从来就不是和国民党反动政府那样地专门凭口供定罪的，而是完全依靠调查研究和真凭实据的。正因为这样，所以我们严格禁止使用任何肉刑来逼口供。但是，当我们经过细密的调查，掌握了完全确实的证据之后，即使没有口供，同样可以判罪，直至判处死刑。罪犯们妄想抵赖，那是完全无用的。
    有一些贪污盗窃分子根据狭隘的经验，用历史类比的方法，武断说将来一定要纠偏、反左，妄想进行偷天换日的投机活动，这是永远也不会成功的。政策不是掌握在贪污盗窃分子之手，而是掌握在人民群众之手，掌握在党和工人阶级之手。不利于人民的事，人民是不会做的。人民决心要搜尽一切贪污盗窃分子，而决不会让他们来投机、反噬。
    应当警告一切罪犯，尤其是“攻守同盟”的罪恶主谋者：怙恶不悛、罪大恶极的分子，必将受到最严厉的惩罚。继续抵抗下去，只有加重自己的罪状，决不可能有任何其他的结果。
    对于“攻守同盟”中被欺骗的、还愿意坦白的贪污盗窃分子，不管他们过去是否已经封了口，具了结，赃款赃物是否已经用去一部，追赃中是否还有其他困难（如存赃者赖账等），只要真正决心坦白悔过，都应该按照政务院公布的这两个文件的规定，正确解决他们的问题，给他们以出路。对于彻底坦白者，应该号召他们戴罪立功，并尽快地按照政务院公布的这两个文件的规定，给予宽大处理，使各种谎言不攻自破。
    中央节约检查委员会关于处理贪污、浪费及克服官僚主义错误的若干规定中明确地规定：“对大多数情节较轻或彻底坦白，立功自赎者，从宽处理；对少数情节严重恶劣而又拒不坦白者，予以严惩”。北京市人民政府关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法中也采取了“过去从宽，今后从严”、“坦白从宽，抗拒从严”等基本原则。因此，一切贪污盗窃分子如不彻底坦白，走上改造自新的道路，最后被清查出来，就决不能逃避法律的严惩。
    许多贪污盗窃分子现在正千方百计地进行活动，企图“摸底”，打听运动的时间，打听领导的决心和政策的究竟。现在这两个文件的全部规定，就是我们的“底”。一切愿意抗美援朝胜利，愿意国家建设成功，愿意让新中国走向独立富强，愿意人民走向光明幸福的人们，一定要正确掌握这两个文件为武器，继续坚持斗争，击破贪污盗窃分子的“攻守同盟”和一切抗拒，争取反贪污、反盗窃斗争的彻底胜利。
