    I. Qu Yaoli, a cotton planting model, achieved an unprecedented record of 912 jin of seed cotton per mu in 1951. This fully demonstrates that only in the era of Mao Zedong, with the liberation of the working people and the high development of patriotic enthusiasm and production initiative, can great achievements be created.

    II. Qu Yaoli is from Quzhuangtou Village, Jiexian County, Shanxi Province. In the old society, he was a middle peasant. At that time, he always believed that as long as he worked hard, he would become rich. In 1941, he started planting five mu of cotton, with a yield of less than 100 jin of seed cotton per mu. However, the Japanese devils forcibly requisitioned 150 jin per mu, and the shortfall had to be bought from the market at a high price to make up the difference, causing him great losses.

    III. After the Japanese surrendered, he planted six mu of cotton, but the bandit阎锡山阎锡山 replaced the Japanese rule and oppressed the peasants in the same way. The price of one jin of ginned cotton was only equivalent to three jin of wheat, which was not enough to cover the cost of fertilizer and seeds. From then on, Qu Yaoli lost the motivation to grow cotton.

    IV. After liberation, the People's Government rewarded cotton planting, stipulated reasonable cotton-grain price ratios, and provided loans, water carts, and fertilizers to help peasants solve their difficulties. With the help of the People's Government, Qu Yaoli began to improve his cotton planting enthusiasm from 1948.

    V. With the help of the People's Government, Qu Yaoli developed his years of accumulated cotton planting experience and created a set of scientific cotton planting techniques. His land preparation technique is closely linked to the requirements of drought prevention and moisture retention: after the autumn harvest, the ground is first raked and broken up, then plowed in autumn, and smoothed with a drag to overwinter. After thawing in the spring, the land is raked and spring plowing is carried out as early as possible, and smoothed immediately after plowing to maintain soil moisture and prevent it from being lost.

    VI. Qu Yaoli pays great attention to the preservation of cotton seeds. He places the seeds in a ventilated, dry, and smoke-free place. Before sowing, he immerses the seeds in hot water that is hot to the touch, stirring vigorously until it is no longer hot, leaving it to stand for about a mealtime. Then, he takes out the seeds, spreads them on the ground to drain the sludge, mixes them with ashes, and sows them in time before Grain Rain.

    VII. Qu Yaoli's cotton planting method involves using a plowshare without a moldboard to open a three-finger-deep furrow when sowing, sowing the seeds into it, and compacting them with the feet to ensure close contact with the soil. Then, a deeper false furrow is opened next to the seeds with a plow with a moldboard, so that moist, fine soil covers the cotton seeds, and the furrow is dragged twice in the direction of the furrow to make the soil covering the seeds tight and fine. At the same time, small clods can be turned into the false furrow. This can ensure uniform emergence.

    VIII. Qu Yaoli pays great attention to irrigation techniques. He uses well water to irrigate, but because the water contains alkali, which easily damages the growth of cotton seedlings, he avoids watering during sowing and seedling stage, and only starts watering when budding. The first watering is small, and after the first watering, he irrigates frequently and lightly, once every five or six days, but the amount of water each time must be appropriately controlled according to the actual situation. After the cotton bears bolls, it can be watered on average every eight or nine days, and the amount of water can be increased, continuing until the cotton begins to fluff.

    IX. Qu Yaoli's fertilization work involves sending manure to the field in the winter of the previous year and sealing it with soil, and then spreading it and turning it into the soil after thawing in the coming year, so that the fertilizer can be fully decomposed, increase soil temperature, and improve soil structure. He applies more than 10,000 jin of sheep and horse manure per mu as base fertilizer. This fertilizer allows the cotton plants to develop fully and balanced. In addition, he adds 16 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu as top dressing in high-yield land.

    X. Qu Yaoli's thinning and spacing work for cotton is carried out in three stages: the first time starts when the seedlings are just over an inch tall, leaving the seedlings relatively dense; the second time, one seedling is left every four inches; and the third time, the seedlings can be spaced. The density of seedlings left is one chi between plants and two chi between rows, about 3,000 plants per mu, adopting the advanced Soviet experience of close planting.

    XI. "Hoe the cotton seven times, the bolls are like garlic cloves," which shows that hoeing the cotton field frequently is also one of the main conditions for achieving high yields. Hoeing should start early and frequently from the time the cotton seedlings grow two true leaves, hoeing after rain, after watering, and after applying top dressing.

    XII. Precise pruning techniques are also a major factor in high cotton yields. When the first fruiting branch of the cotton sees flower buds, the "stripping pants" work is carried out first, stripping off the leaves and branches below the first fruiting branch to avoid affecting the development of the fruiting branch. Afterwards, the "thief buds" and "mad whips" that emerge from the leaf axils on the cotton stems and fruiting branches are stripped off at any time.

    XIII. After entering the dog days and before the Beginning of Autumn, keep twelve or thirteen fruiting branches on each cotton plant and then pluck off the top. After each fruiting branch has borne three to five cotton bolls, the tips of the fruiting branches are also cut off separately. This can maintain an appropriate number of bolls and promote early maturity. When the cotton is fluffing, remove part of the large leaves at the lower part of the main stem to facilitate ventilation and light transmission.

    XIV. Qu Yaoli also pays attention to the prevention and control of cotton field diseases and insect pests. Last year, with the help and guidance of the Yuncheng Farm, he treated insects three times with tobacco water, cotton oil soap, and wettable 666. At the same time, Qu Yaoli also used the collective strength of the mutual aid group to quickly carry out pest control work once pests occurred.

    XV. Qu Yaoli experienced in his cotton planting experience that it is impossible to achieve high yields by working alone. Therefore, last spring, he took the correct path of "organizing" called for by Chairman Mao. He formed a mutual aid group, and the group specifically stipulated a system for evaluating work points, meetings, production, and learning. Because his mutual aid group did a good job in political study and democratic style, the whole group always maintained a high level of production enthusiasm.

    XVI. Last spring, before Grain Rain, it rained a little, and Qu Yaoli mobilized the entire group to rush to plant in the fields before dawn, and by the afternoon, the group had finished sowing all 48 mu of cotton fields. Because of the timely sowing, the emergence was uniform. However, many individual households did not sow in time, so the seedlings did not emerge evenly. Ye Dianwa, who was skeptical of the mutual aid group, truly felt the benefits of organizing in this sowing achievement.

    XVII. After the autumn harvest, in order to lay a good foundation for the high yield of 1952, the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group launched a campaign to remove weeds and exterminate insect eggs, mobilizing more than 300 men, women, and children in the village and organizing joint prevention with neighboring villages, and cleared all the weeds from the 66 hectares of land in the village within a few days.

    XVIII. Qu Yaoli is not only a model of high yield, but also a model of patriotism. Last summer, he responded to the government's call to sell and store cotton, and mobilized the entire village to sell more than 4,800 jin of ginned cotton, earning the title of patriotic cotton selling model. In the donation of aircraft and artillery campaign, he was the first to respond to Li Shunda's call to donate a "Peasant" aircraft, donating ten dan of wheat from increased production. After harvesting cotton last year, he sold all of the more than 10,000 jin of seed cotton to the government.

    XIX. Last National Day, the Central People's Government invited Qu Yaoli to Beijing to participate in the ceremony and attend the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He was indescribably happy to see Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao asked him with great concern: "How do you grow your cotton so well?" Qu Yaoli said: "It's not that I grow it well, it's that Chairman Mao leads it well." Chairman Mao instructed him to go back and work harder to increase production.

    XX. When Qu Yaoli visited the North China Urban and Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition and the Tianjin No. 2 Textile Factory last year, he truly recognized the greatness of the working class. He said: "Weaving cloth by traditional methods requires one person to work all day to weave less than one zhang of cloth, but one weaving machine can do the work of a dozen people." He said to labor models Wang Deshan and Sun Guilan: "We peasant brothers must guarantee the supply of cotton and weave good cloth so that the volunteers can wear it warmly and fight the American devils."

    XXI. Qu Yaoli's return from Beijing inspired the hearts of every peasant. They all wanted to learn from him, organize, improve farming techniques, and strive for more production in 1952. The Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group is also preparing to invest more than 200 dan of wheat to expand the production capacity of the mutual aid group, and study how to improve technology and strive to achieve a high-yield plan of 1,000 jin per mu, increase cotton production, and cooperate with the development of the motherland's industry.

    植棉丰产模范曲耀离
    苗地  赵志方  作
    一、植棉丰产模范曲耀离一九五一年创造了每亩产九百十二斤籽棉的丰产纪录，是我国植棉史上空前的成绩。这充分地证明了只有在毛泽东的时代，劳动人民翻了身，高度发扬了爱国热情和生产积极性，就会创造出伟大的成绩来。
    二、曲耀离是山西省解县曲庄头村人，在旧社会里是个中农。那时候，他总认为只要劳动好就会富裕。一九四一年他开始种了五亩棉花，每亩产量不到一百斤籽棉，可是日本鬼子每亩却要强征一百五十斤，不足的还要从市上用高价买了来抵数，吃了很大的亏。
    三、日寇投降后，他种了六亩棉花，但是阎锡山匪徒代替了日寇的统治，照样压迫农民。一斤皮棉的价钱才合三斤小麦，连肥料种籽的开销都不够，从此曲耀离就再也没有种棉花的劲头了。
    四、解放后，人民政府奖励植棉，规定了合理的棉粮比价，并且贷款、贷水车、贷肥料等给农民，帮助农民解决困难。曲耀离在人民政府的帮助下，从一九四八年才又开始提高植棉情绪。
    五、曲耀离在人民政府帮助下，发挥了他多年积累的植棉经验并创造了一套合乎科学的植棉技术。他的整地技术是密切结合着防旱保墒要求的：在秋收后，先把地面耙碎，然后秋耕翻地，用耱磨平过冬。来春解冻后，及早耙地和春耕，耕后随即磨平，保持土墒，不使散失。
    六、曲耀离对棉籽的保藏十分注意。他把种籽放在通风、干燥和不受烟薰的地方。播种前先把种籽浸入烫手的热水中，用力搅拌，直到不烫手为止，静放约一顿饭时间，再把种籽捞出，铺在地上渗去淤水，用草木灰拌种后，在谷雨前及时播种。
    七、曲耀离的植棉方法，在播种时先用不带犁镜的犁铧开一条三指深的条沟，把种籽播入，用脚踏实，使与土壤密接。然后再用带分土镜的犁在种籽旁开一条较深的虚沟，使湿润的细土覆盖在棉籽上，用耱顺沟方向磨两次，使种籽上的覆土紧密细碎，同时可把小土块翻入虚沟里。这样可以保证出苗整齐。
    八、曲耀离非常注意灌溉技术。他用井水浇地，但因水内含碱，容易损害棉苗生长，因此他在播种和幼苗期内都避免浇水，到结蕾时才开始浇水。头水浇的水小，浇过头水后，就连续的勤浇、轻浇，五、六天就浇一次，但每次的浇水量都必须根据实际情况适当加以节制。等棉花结桃后，平均八、九天可以浇水一次，水量可以多一些，一直浇到棉花吐絮时为止。
    九、曲耀离的施肥工作是在头年冬季就把粪送到田里用土封住，来年解冻后就铺开翻进土里去，这样可使肥料充分腐熟，增加地温，改进土壤结构。他每亩约施一万多斤羊粪和骡马粪做基肥。这种肥料可使棉株得到充分而平衡的发育。此外，他在丰产地里每亩再另加十六斤硫酸錏作追肥。
    一○、曲耀离对棉花的间苗、定苗等工作是分三次进行的：第一次在苗高寸余时开始进行，留的苗比较密；第二次每隔四寸留一苗；第三次就可定苗。留苗的密度是株距一尺，行距二尺，每亩约三千株左右，采用了苏联先进的密植经验。
    一一、“棉锄七遍桃如蒜瓣”，说明了棉田多锄也是达到丰产的主要条件之一。锄地从棉苗长出两个真叶开始，要早锄、勤锄，雨后锄，浇水后以及施追肥后，都要重视锄地工作。
    一二、精密的整枝技术也是植棉丰产的主要因素之一。当棉花第一果枝见到花蕾时，先进行“脱裤”工作，把第一果枝以下的叶枝剥去，以免影响果枝的发育。以后随时剥去棉茎和果枝上叶腋间发出来的“贼芽”和“疯?”。
    一三、入伏后到立秋前，每棵棉花留够十二、三个果枝后把顶尖摘去。等每个果枝结了三至五个棉桃后，把果枝尖也分别打去。这样可以保持适当的桃数，促进早熟。棉花吐絮时，把主干下部的大叶摘去一部分，以利通风透光。
    一四、曲耀离对防治棉田病虫害也很注意。去年他在运城农场的帮助和指导下，用烟草水、棉油皂和可湿性六六六等，治了三次虫。同时曲耀离并运用互助组的集体力量，虫害一发生，就很快地进行扑灭工作。
    一五、曲耀离在植棉经验中体验到要想取得丰产，靠单干是不行的，所以在去年春天他走了毛主席号召“组织起来”的正确道路。组成了互助组，组内具体的规定了评工记分、会议和生产、学习等制度，他的互助组由于政治学习和民主作风搞得好，所以全组始终保持着高涨的生产情绪。
    一六、去春，谷雨前落了点雨，曲耀离就动员全组在天还没亮就到地里去抢种，到下午就把全组四十八亩棉田播种完了。由于及时播种，所以出苗整齐。可是许多单干户因播种不及时，因此苗儿也出得不齐。对互助组怀疑的叶典娃在这次播种成绩中真正感到组织起来的好处。
    一七、秋收后曲耀离互助组为了打好一九五二年的丰产基础，他就发动了除杂草、灭虫卵的运动，动员了全村男女老少三百多人并与邻村组织联防，几天内就把全村六十六顷地的杂草消除干净。
    一八、曲耀离不仅是丰产模范，而且还是个爱国模范，去年夏天，他响应了政府售棉储棉的号召，动员全村卖出四千八百多斤皮棉，得到了爱国售棉模范的称号。在捐献飞机大炮运动中，他首先响应李顺达发起的捐献“农民号”飞机的号召，从增产中捐出十石小麦。去年收棉后，他又把一万多斤籽棉全部卖给了政府。
    一九、去年国庆节，中央人民政府邀请曲耀离到北京参加观礼并列席中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议，他见到了毛主席真有说不出来的喜欢。毛主席很关切地问他：“你的棉花怎样种得那么好？”曲耀离说：“这不是我种得好，是毛主席领导的好。”毛主席嘱咐他回去要更加努力增产。
    二○、曲耀离去年参观华北城乡物资交流展览会和天津纺织二厂的时候，他真正的认识到工人阶级的伟大。他说：“土法织布一个人忙一天还织不了一丈布，但是一个织布机就顶十几个人做的活。”他对劳动模范王德山、孙桂兰说：“我们农民兄弟一定保证供给棉花，织好布给志愿军穿得暖暖地打美国鬼子。”
    二一、曲耀离从北京回来，他的光荣鼓舞了每个农民的心，他们都要向他学习，组织起来提高耕作技术，争取一九五二年更多的生产。曲耀离互助组也准备投资二百多担麦子，来扩大互助组的生产力量，并研究提高技术，争取达到每亩一千斤的丰产计划，提高棉产，配合祖国工业的发展。
