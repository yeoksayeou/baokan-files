    Unprecedented Brutal Crimes in Human History
    Lao Junzhan, Director of the Jiusan Society
    In order to salvage its forever unsalvageable military defeat on the Korean battlefield, American imperialism, in addition to using various shameless means to sabotage the Korean armistice talks, has recently blatantly committed an unprecedented brutal crime in history. Disregarding everything, it openly and on a large scale used bacteriological weapons to conduct an inhumane bacteriological war against the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and against the Korean people who are in arduous battles.
    Following the atrocities of conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea, the American aggressors even invaded our Northeast China airspace with 68 batches of military aircraft, 448 sorties, from February 29 to March 5, spreading a large number of insects that transmit bacteria, and indiscriminately bombing. This barbaric atrocity shows that American imperialism is determined to be enemies with the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world, and wants to act recklessly to the end. As pointed out by Minister Zhou Enlai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government in his statement on February 24: "If the people of the world do not resolutely stop it, then the disaster that has fallen on the peaceful people of Korea today will fall on the peaceful people of the world tomorrow." Therefore, we must appeal to all righteous people in the world, especially the heroic women, to condemn this insane atrocity of American imperialism. In order to safeguard peace, democracy, and justice, and in order to protect our children, we must not allow this bloody crime of American bandits to continue to develop. We must mobilize all forces to justly condemn and severely punish the bacteriological war criminals. No matter how barbaric and brutal the American aggressors are, we must defeat them, and we can defeat them!

    人类历史上空前残暴的罪行
    九三学社理事  劳君展
    美帝国主义为了挽救它在朝鲜战场永远不能挽救的军事惨败，除了以各种无耻手段破坏朝鲜停战谈判之外，最近又露骨地干出了历史上空前的残暴罪行。它不顾一切地、公开地、大规模地使用了细菌武器，向英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，向在艰苦战斗中的朝鲜人民，进行了灭绝人性的细菌战争。
    继在朝鲜进行细菌战争的暴行以后，美国侵略者竟于二月二十九日至三月五日，更以军用飞机六十八批，四百四十八架次侵入我国东北领空，散布大量传播细菌的昆虫，并滥施轰炸。这种野蛮的兽行说明了美帝国主义决心和中朝人民和世界人民为敌，而想蛮干到底。正如我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长在二月二十四日的声明中指出：“如果全世界人民不坚决地加以制止，那么，今天落在朝鲜和平人民头上的灾难，明天就会落在世界和平人民的头上”；因此，我们要向全世界一切正义的人们，特别是英勇的妇女们，控诉美帝国主义这种疯狂的暴行。为了保障和平、民主和正义，为了保卫我们的儿童，我们决不能让美国强盗这种血淋淋的罪行继续发展下去。我们必须动员一切的力量，对细菌战犯予以正义的声讨和严厉的制裁。不管美国侵略者怎样野蛮、残暴，我们一定要打败它，而且能够打败它！
