    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 6th. At the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice talks on March 6, the other side continued to unreasonably reject our side's reasonable solutions to the issues of neutral nations nominations and rotation and port issues. The other side also continued to insist on restricting the inspection work of the neutral nations inspection teams on the replacement of weapons and ammunition entering Korea during the armistice, using the confidential design and characteristics of weapons and ammunition as an excuse. Our side solemnly pointed out that our side's position on the issue of neutral nations nominations is firm. Our side's reasonable compromise plan on the issues of rotation and ports should have completely resolved this issue long ago. Since both sides have agreed that the weapons and ammunition consumed during the armistice can only be replaced on the basis of the same performance, the same type, and one-for-one replacement, if both sides are truly willing to strictly abide by the agreement, they should not use any excuse to restrict the neutral nations inspection teams from inspecting the weapons and ammunition entering Korea during the armistice.
    At yesterday's subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, our side proposed to first determine the principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war based on the prisoner of war materials that have been agreed or determined, in order to resolve the only fundamental disagreement between the two sides currently existing in the fourth agenda item. At today's subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, the other side was still unwilling to respond to our side's efforts and continued to avoid discussing the principles for solving the problem, resulting in no progress at today's meeting.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上 
    我重申在中立国提名问题上的坚定立场
    【新华社开城六日电】三月六日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，对方仍然无理拒绝我方对于中立国提名问题和轮换与口岸问题的合理解决方案。对方并继续坚持以武器弹药的机密设计与特性为藉口，限制中立国视察小组对于停战期间进入朝鲜的武器弹药的替换的检查工作。我方严正指出，我方在中立国提名问题上的立场是坚定的。我方在轮换与口岸问题上的合理折衷方案，早已应该完全解决了这一问题。双方既已协议停战期间所耗损的武器弹药只能在同性能、同类型和一件换一件的基础上进行替换，如果双方确愿严格遵守协议，就不应该以任何藉口限制中立国视察小组检查停战期间进入朝鲜的武器与弹药。
    我方代表在昨天第四项议程小组委员会上提出了以已经协议或已经确定的战俘材料为基础，首先确定释放和遣返全部战俘的原则，以解决目前存在于第四项议程中的双方唯一的基本分歧。在今天的第四项议程小组委员会上，对方仍然不愿响应我方的努力，继续避免讨论解决问题的原则，以致今天的会议毫无进展。
