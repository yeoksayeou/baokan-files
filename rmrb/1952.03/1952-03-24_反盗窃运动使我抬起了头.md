    Anti-Theft Campaign Made Me Hold My Head High

    Comrade Editor: I am an apprentice at the Xingsheng Leather Shop in Beijing. For three years, I have been oppressed by the owner. Beatings and scoldings were commonplace. Once, I burned two hemp ropes while stoking the fire, and he beat me severely with a stick. He exploited me terribly. I earned 60 jin of corn per month, but he deducted 20 jin. Last summer, I worked 18 or 19 hours a day, and couldn't sleep until 2 a.m. Since liberation, he has never allowed me to join the trade union, nor has he allowed me to participate in study sessions. He once told me, "Others haven't joined the trade union, how can you join the trade union!" When the anti-theft campaign started, he gave me 500,000 yuan and said, "Let's part as friends!" and fired me just like that. I didn't dare ask him why, so I had to go home. Soon, the reasoning team conducted a reasoning struggle against him and brought me back. I was extremely happy this time. I knew that the anti-theft campaign had liberated me, and that Chairman Mao and the Communist Party had saved me. That very night, I participated in the reasoning struggle meeting in our shop. For the first time, I confronted the owner and struggled against him face to face. The owner's problems are really significant, but he is cunning and unwilling to confess. I have made up my mind that I will not stop until his crimes are thoroughly clarified.

    反盗窃运动使我抬起了头
    编辑同志：我是北京兴盛皮子铺的学徒，三年来我一直受着掌柜的欺压。打骂是家常事。有一次我烧火把两个麻绳烤坏了，他用棍子狠狠地打了我一顿。他剥削我真厉害，我每月挣六十斤玉米，他就克扣二十斤。去年夏天，我每天干活十八、九个钟点，到夜里两点钟才能睡觉。解放以来，他从来不叫我参加工会，也不许我参加学习。他曾对我说：“别人没入工会，你怎么可以入工会！”他在反盗窃运动开始时给了我五十万元，说：“咱们爷俩好来好去！”就这样把我解雇了。我也不敢问他什么原因，只好回家。不久，说理队向他进行说理斗争，才把我找回来。我这回可高兴极了，我知道这是反盗窃运动解放了我，是毛主席共产党救了我。当天晚上，我就参加了本店中的说理斗争会，我第一次面对面地和掌柜进行斗争。掌柜的问题真不小，但他狡猾，不肯坦白。我已下定决心，不把他的罪行彻底搞清，决不罢休。    周江口述  马瑞英记
