Students in Beijing universities actively participated in and promoted the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in their schools, powerfully exposing and criticizing the decadent bourgeois ideology entrenched within the institutions. Through this movement, the students' thinking took a significant step forward. Many students also actively participated in the off-campus inspection teams, assisting the People's Government in its struggle against illegal capitalists.

Nearly one hundred percent of the students in many Beijing universities participated in this movement. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Communist Youth League organizations in each school, they correctly understood the significance of this movement through studying documents and listening to reports, closely cooperating with the actions of all teachers, staff, and workers in the school, making this movement a fervent mass movement in the schools. Because schools are educational fronts, the students, in addition to helping the school authorities diligently track down corrupt elements and investigate waste, paid particular attention to the struggle on the ideological front. Students actively made criticisms and suggestions to the school's administrative leaders, sincerely and seriously criticized the decadent bourgeois ideas of some teachers, and also exposed and denounced the harm that many reactionary ideas in the schools had inflicted upon them. To effectively help teachers transform their thinking, students and teachers in many schools enthusiastically held teacher-student meetings, jointly criticizing bourgeois ideology. Many students enthusiastically helped teachers analyze and examine bourgeois ideas in teaching. Many students often talked with teachers, analyzed problems, and helped teachers examine their thoughts until late at night. During the continuous teacher self-criticism meetings held in various schools, the students even more enthusiastically and intensely analyzed and criticized the teachers' thinking.

Students severely criticized those teachers who blindly worshiped British and American bourgeoisie, spreading bourgeois ideas in large quantities on the podium, even disseminating reactionary remarks, as well as teachers who treated the people's education with perfunctory and bureaucratic attitudes. Students throughout Yenching University angrily denounced the crimes of American imperialist cultural aggression. Students revealed that many courses in various departments still maintained a set of standards formulated according to American university standards, and the teaching materials were also entirely from the American bourgeoisie. These courses and materials fully exposed the decay and decline, crimes and ugliness of imperialism. Students in the Department of Sanitary Engineering at the College of Engineering of Peking University revealed that there was serious pro-American thought among the teachers in the department, so that in the newly constructed laboratory, because all equipment was required to meet "American standards," everything from the laboratory tables to the faucets and towel racks were all American-style. This not only wasted national resources but also poisoned the students with pro-American thought. At the teacher-student conference in the Foreign Languages Department of Tsinghua University, students revealed that many teachers used decadent bourgeois ideas to educate students, spread pro-American thought, and even induced students to prepare to study in capitalist countries. Many students even more angrily revealed and denounced the harm that the reactionary thoughts and remarks of some teachers in the schools had inflicted upon them. Students at Yenching University revealed the shameless remarks spread by the reactionary organization "Scolding Group" of certain professors in the school. Students in the Department of History at the school even more severely criticized the reactionary thinking of Professor Nie Chongqi of the department. Students at Fu Jen Catholic University also revealed and denounced the reactionary thoughts of Dong Weixian, an associate professor in the Department of Chemistry, and Lu Huaibao, a professor in the Department of Biology.

Students also exposed and criticized the bourgeois ideas of sectarianism, departmentalism, and individualism in the schools. Students in the Department of Agricultural Chemistry at Beijing Agricultural University revealed the serious sectarianism among the teachers in the department, and some students even accused: Some senior intellectuals in the Department of Agricultural Chemistry with decadent bourgeois ideas treated teaching assistants and students as stepping stones. Students in the Department of Education at Beijing Normal University revealed the sectarianism of the teachers in the department, these teachers were not united and attacked each other, "one professor, one mountain stronghold." Students in the Department of Preschool Education at the school said: The leading ideology in our department is fundamentally bourgeois ideology, and it resists the ideology of the working class. It never conveys or implements the government's policies on culture and education and teaching principles. Many professors in the department compete for power and profit, and engage in infighting, fully demonstrating the bourgeois individualism of harming others to benefit oneself. Many students also revealed the fact that some teachers spread purely professional and purely technical views in teaching, as well as encouraging students with fame and profit ideas. These erroneous words and deeds of teachers not only caused students to tend to detach themselves from politics but also fueled students' thoughts of "climbing up." For example, some teachers said to students: "Study hard, and you will all be section chiefs, division chiefs, and bureau chiefs in the future." Many school teachers openly encouraged students to "do well in technology and ask less about politics" and "learn technology well, and earning millet will not be a problem." These erroneous ideas had a very bad influence on students.

Students also made severe criticisms of some teachers' seriously irresponsible teaching attitude and work attitude. Students at Fu Jen Catholic University criticized the seriously irresponsible phenomena in the teaching work of some teachers. Students said that some teachers lecturing on "Secondary Education" simply copied from old newspapers, read it in class, and muddled through. Moreover, most of the content was decadent and reactionary fallacies, and this kind of teacher was completely irresponsible to the students.

After this serious and fierce ideological struggle, the universities have undergone significant changes. When many teachers made sincere and profound self-criticisms and cleansed their dirty thoughts, they were immediately warmly welcomed by the vast number of students, forming an unprecedented unity between teachers and students. At the same time, many "banners" of bourgeois thought that were worshiped by students in the past fell down on their own. For example, students in some departments of Yenching University each took a professor in their own department who was relatively good in his profession but full of pro-American thoughts and purely technical viewpoints as their goal of striving. These professors were their ideal "banners." However, in this movement, these professors' bourgeois decadent thoughts were criticized, and they themselves also made self-criticisms. This made the banner of bourgeois thought fall down naturally, and both the students and the teachers themselves were liberated from the influence of erroneous bourgeois thought.

Many university students said: In this movement, we once again received patriotic ideological education. The anti-waste exhibitions held in various schools had great educational significance for the students. This not only eliminated the erroneous idea that many students in the past believed that there was no corruption or waste in the school, but also established the students' style of cherishing the property of the motherland and advocating integrity and simplicity. Many students received profound education from discussing and analyzing teachers' erroneous thoughts. Many Party members and Youth League members actively helped others in this movement, and they themselves were also tested and tempered. Through this movement, the relationship between the Party and the masses has become closer. In the movement, many students sincerely criticized their own bourgeois decadent thoughts. For example, some students talked about their own decadent and degenerate thoughts of only envying the extravagant lives of others, envying professors' degrees, only thinking about "climbing up," and only thinking about studying in bourgeois countries, etc. For example, a female student at Peking University examined her decadent idea of ​​only wanting to build a small western-style house by the sea and living a "happy" life of writing poetry in the house. Some students in the Department of Transportation of the Northern Jiaotong University Jingyuan examined that because they were poisoned by bourgeois education, they only wanted to graduate immediately and become section chiefs and bureau chiefs. In the movement, many students, due to the improvement of their political consciousness, bravely reported the illegal behavior of their fathers, brothers, and relatives in stealing state property. Peking University alone reported more than 200 pieces of materials.

Many university students more actively participated in the work of the inspection teams organized by the People's Government. They enthusiastically and actively studied the work and helped the government investigate and sort out materials. Everyone felt that this was a test for themselves. Many university students, with a selfless fighting spirit, fought tenaciously in various work posts and carried out fierce struggles with illegal capitalists.

In the movement, many students who went home for winter vacation and later returned to school felt that the school had changed greatly after returning to school. They found that students and teachers had made great progress, but they themselves had not kept up with the development of the movement. Most of these returning students quickly caught up with the help of Party members and Youth League members and joined the movement, but there were also a few students who were still lagging behind the development of the movement because of unclear understanding.

In the resolute struggle against bourgeois decadent thoughts, all schools have achieved many results, but these are only preliminary results. Moreover, some universities, such as Peking Union Medical College, which are more seriously corroded by bourgeois ideology, have not yet seriously and thoroughly exposed bourgeois decadent thoughts, and they should immediately strengthen the struggle on the ideological front.

    “三反”运动中的北京高等学校学生
    柏生
    北京各高等学校的学生，积极参加并推动了学校中的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，有力地揭发和批判了盘踞在学校中的资产阶级腐朽思想。经过这一运动，同学们的思想大大提高了一步。许多学生并积极地参加了校外检查组的工作，帮助人民政府向违法资本家进行了斗争。
    北京许多高等学校的学生，几乎百分之百地参加了这一运动。他们在各校共产党、青年团组织的领导下，通过学习文件和听报告，正确地认识了这个运动的意义，密切地配合了全校教师、职员和工人的行动，使这个运动在学校中成为了热烈的群众运动。因为学校是教育阵地，因此，同学们除了帮助学校当局认真追捕贪污分子、检查浪费现象外，更特别重视了思想战线上的斗争。同学们积极地向学校行政领导人提出了批评和建议，诚恳严肃地批判了某些教师中的资产阶级的腐朽思想，也揭露和控诉了学校中的许多反动思想给予自己的毒害。为了有效地帮助教师进行思想改造，许多学校的同学和教师在一起热烈地举行了师生大会，共同批判了资产阶级思想。许多同学热情地帮助教师们分析和检讨教学中的资产阶级思想。很多同学经常和教师谈话，分析问题，帮助教师检查思想，往往深夜还不休息。在各校连续举行教师检讨大会的期间，同学们更热情紧张地对教师思想进行了细密的分析和批判。
    同学们对于那些盲目崇拜英美资产阶级，在讲台上大量传播资产阶级思想，甚至散布反动言论的教师，以及以敷衍塞责、官僚主义态度对待人民教育事业的教师，都进行了严厉的批评。燕京大学全校同学愤怒地控诉了美帝国主义文化侵略的罪行。同学们揭发了各系的许多课程至今还保持依照美国大学标准制订的一套，教材也完全是美国资产阶级的一套。这些课程和教材充分地暴露了帝国主义的腐朽和没落，罪恶和丑陋。北京大学工学院卫生工程学系同学揭发了该系教师中有严重的崇美思想，以致在新建设的实验室里，因为全部设备都要求合乎“美国标准”，从实验台到水龙头、手巾架全部是美国式的。这不仅浪费了国家资财，更使同学们受了崇美思想的毒害。在清华大学外文系的师生大会上，同学们揭露了许多教师用资产阶级的腐朽思想来教育同学，散布崇美思想，甚至引诱同学们准备到资本主义国家留学去。许多学校的同学更愤怒地揭露和控诉了学校中某些教师的反动思想和言论给予自己的毒害。燕京大学同学揭发了该校某些教授的反动组织“骂人团”在学校中所散布的无耻言论。该校历史系同学更严厉地批判了该系聂崇岐教授的反动思想。辅仁大学同学也揭露和控诉了该校化学系副教授董维宪、生物系教授鹿怀宝的反动思想。
    对学校中的宗派主义、本位主义、个人主义等资产阶级思想，同学们也进行了揭发和批判。北京农业大学农业化学系的同学揭露了该系教师间的严重的宗派主义，有的同学甚至控诉说：农业化学系一些有着腐朽资产阶级思想的高级知识分子，把助教、学生当作垫足石。北京师范大学教育系同学揭发了该系教师的宗派主义，这些教师闹不团结，相互打击，“一个教授，一座山头”。该校保育系同学说：我们系里领导思想根本是资产阶级思想，对工人阶级思想是抗拒的。对人民政府的文教政策、教学方针，从不传达，也不贯彻执行。系里的许多教授争权夺利，勾心斗角，十足表现了损人利己的资产阶级的个人主义思想。许多同学也揭发了某些教师在教学上散布纯业务、纯技术观点的事实，以及用名利思想来鼓励同学们的情形，教师的这些错误言行，不仅造成了同学们脱离政治的倾向，而且助长了同学们“向上爬”的思想。如有的教师对同学说：“你们好好念书，将来都是科长、处长、局长。”许多学校的教师更公开鼓励学生“搞好技术，少问政治”和“学好技术，赚小米不成问题”，这些错误思想都曾给予同学以极坏的影响。
    对某些教师的严重不负责任的教学态度和工作态度，同学们也提出了严厉的批评。辅仁大学的同学批评了若干教师在教学工作中的严重不负责任现象，同学们说有的教师讲“中等教育学”，只是从旧报上抄抄，在课堂上念念，混时间。而且内容大部分是腐朽的反动的谬论，这种教师对同学是完全不负责任的。
    经过这一次严重激烈的思想斗争，各高等学校都有了显著的变化。当很多教师作了诚恳和深刻的自我检讨，清洗了肮脏的思想后，立即受到广大同学们的热烈欢迎，形成了师生之间的空前大团结。同时许多过去被学生们崇拜的资产阶级思想的“旗帜”都自己倒下去了。譬如燕京大学某些学系的同学，各以本系某一位业务上比较好，但却充满了崇美思想和单纯技术观点的教授作为努力的目标，这些教授就是他们理想的“旗帜”。但在这次运动中，这些教授的资产阶级的腐朽思想受到批判，他们自己也做了检讨。这样就使资产阶级思想的旗帜，自然地倒下去了，同学和教师本人，都从错误的资产阶级思想影响下面解放出来。
    许多高等学校的同学都说：在这次运动中，我们再一次受到了爱国主义的思想教育。各校普遍举行的反浪费展览会，对同学的教育意义很大。这不仅消除了过去许多同学认为学校中没有什么贪污、浪费现象的错误思想，更树立了同学们对爱护祖国财产崇尚廉洁朴素的作风。不少同学由讨论和分析教师的错误思想中，得到了深刻的教育。许多党团员在这次运动中积极地帮助了别人，自己也受到了考验和锻炼。经过这次运动，党和群众的关系更加密切了。在运动中，许多同学诚恳地批判了自己的资产阶级腐朽思想。如有的同学谈出了自己只羡慕别人的奢侈生活，羡慕教授的学位，光想“往上爬”，光想到资产阶级国家留学等等的腐朽堕落思想。如北京大学一个女同学检讨了她一心只想在海边修所小洋房，在洋房里过着写诗的“幸福”生活的腐朽思想。北方交通大学京院运输系的一些同学，检讨了因为受了资产阶级教育的毒害，一心只想马上毕业出来当科长、局长。在运动中，很多同学由于政治觉悟的提高，他们勇敢地检举了自己的父兄和亲友盗窃国家资财的违法行为。仅北京大学检举的材料就有二百多件。
    许多高等学校的同学，更积极地参加了人民政府组成的检查组工作。他们热情主动地钻研工作，帮助政府调查整理材料。大家都感到这对自己是一个考验。许多高等学校的同学，以忘我的战斗精神，坚强地战斗在各个工作岗位上，和违法资本家进行激烈的斗争。
    在运动中，许多寒假回家，后来返校的同学，到校以后，感到学校大大的变了，他们发现同学和老师都有了很大的进步，而自己却没有跟上运动的发展。其中大多数返校同学经过党团员的帮助，很快地迎头赶上，参加到运动中来，但也有少数同学，因为认识不清，仍然落后于运动的发展。
    在和资产阶级腐朽思想做坚决斗争中，各校都获得了不少成绩，但这还只是初步战果。而且像中国协和医学院等一些受资产阶级思想毒素侵蚀比较严重的高等学校，目前尚未认真彻底地揭发资产阶级的腐朽思想，他们应该立即加强思想战线上的斗争。
