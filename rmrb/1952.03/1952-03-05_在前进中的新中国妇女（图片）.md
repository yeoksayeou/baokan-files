After the launch of the campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the broad masses of women also mobilized. They took practical actions to participate in this great struggle to protect the interests of the people of the motherland. At a forum for women in the Third District of Beijing, housewife Zheng Wenling reported on how she mobilized her son and relatives to confess their crimes, inspiring and encouraging housewives to help their husbands, sons, and relatives quickly confess their criminal behavior.

The outstanding daughters of New China, the heroic female soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, have contributed great strength to the great battle to defend the security of the motherland and save the Korean people, and countless moving heroic deeds have emerged. Zhang Jiande, a model female nurse of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, bravely rushed into a house that was being bombed and burning by enemy planes, and agilely carried the wounded out on her back, placing them in a small gully about ten meters away from the house, and promptly gave the wounded medical treatment and dressing.

Zhao Zongjuan, a female worker and member of the Communist Youth League at the Beijing Xin Yi Cigarette Factory, actively led the female workers in her production team to expose the serious crimes of illegal capitalists who burned account books, resisted the movement, and used inferior cigarettes to impersonate good cigarettes to sell to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army during the campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. This is a scene of Zhao Zongjuan's production team female workers inspecting finished products.

Female logistics personnel of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in order to ensure the supply of grain to the front lines, braved enemy air raids and crossed the blockade line at all costs to carry grain to the front lines.

Zhang Shuyun, a female worker in the middle packing department of the Tianjin Public Hengda Cigarette Factory, created an advanced method of packing cigarettes, which increased the factory's production volume by 9.5%, reduced the scrap rate by 50%, and saved materials by 47%.

Liu Yumei, a female worker at the Fushun Mining Bureau Coal Mine, improved the operation method in her work, solved the problem of water cannon leakage, and increased the daily work efficiency by an average of seven times compared with the puppet Manchukuo period, and the quality increased to 100%, which can save the country more than 630 million yuan in Renminbi every year. This is Liu Yumei explaining to the members of the blasting team she leads how to prevent water cannon leakage.

Hao Jianxiu, a female worker and outstanding member of the Communist Youth League at the State-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, created a scientific fine yarn working method through continuous research and learning, which reduced the leather roller flower rate to 0.25%. It inspired the creativity of workers across the country in production. Now, more than 20,000 fine yarn female workers across the country have learned the Hao Jianxiu working method and used their creative wisdom to further enrich the content of the Hao Jianxiu working method. This is a scene of Hao Jianxiu giving a lecture to students learning the Hao Jianxiu working method.

After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, many young men and women gained freedom of marriage and established happy new families. Zhang Xiaojun, a female member of the Communist Youth League in Zhaicheng Village, Dingxian County, Hebei Province, won the victory after insisting on fighting against the feudal family, and has married young man Qin Wenxiang and established a happy new family. This is a scene of them studying happily together after finishing work.

The women's mutual aid group led by Zhao Guizhuo in Zhoujia Village, Fifth District, Jinxian County, Hebei Province, used the cotton picking break to read newspapers and talk about current affairs to further improve the political awareness of the group members. In order to respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "be sure to harness the Huai River well," the women also actively participated in this huge Huai River harnessing project, and many model deeds emerged. This is a scene of Li Xiuying, a model worker in harnessing the Huai River, carrying soil at the construction site.

The female worker Chi Guizhen group of the Harbin No. 6 Rubber Factory has formulated a plan to increase production and conserve resources since August 1951, guaranteeing to increase the wealth equivalent to 15 tons of grain for the country every month. After the implementation of this plan, the first month exceeded the original plan by 66%, increasing the wealth equivalent to 25 tons of grain for the country. This is a scene of Chi Guizhen and the members of the mutual aid group inspecting finished products.

In the nationwide large-scale production and construction movement, most of the workers' families have also automatically participated in various production and construction work. This is a scene of the families of workers at the Xi'an Coal Mine in Northeast China assisting in removing weeds on both sides of the railway tracks.

The broad rural women of New China have also achieved brilliant achievements in agricultural production. This is a scene of Li Tianying, an outstanding agricultural production expert in Guangrao County, Shandong Province, and a national agricultural labor model, leading a mutual aid group in harvesting wheat.

There are now eighteen railway female passenger service groups across the country. In addition to diligently serving passengers, they also cooperate with the political center at any time and use various forms to carry out propaganda work. This is a scene of railway female passenger service group members washing and wiping carriages.
