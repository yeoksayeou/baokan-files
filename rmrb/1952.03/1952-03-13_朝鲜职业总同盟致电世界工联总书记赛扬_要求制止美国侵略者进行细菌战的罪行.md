Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 11th: Hyun Heun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions, cabled Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, on the 8th, demanding the swift cessation of the heinous crimes of bacteriological warfare by the American aggressors and the severe punishment of the bacteriological war criminals. The cable reads as follows:

The American aggressors are brutally trampling on human morality and international conventions, and are openly and systematically committing murderous atrocities by scattering bacteria-carrying insects in our front and rear areas.

Last year, the American aggressors used poison gas, which aroused the anger of freedom-loving people all over the world. However, since January 28th of this year, the American imperialist plunderers have been continuously using aircraft to scatter large quantities of various insects, such as flies, mosquitoes, spiders, fleas, and grasshoppers, carrying germs of malignant infectious diseases such as plague and cholera, in our front and rear areas. The American aggressors' attempt to commit this heinous atrocity is to massacre large numbers of soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as peaceful residents, and to further expand the war.

The entire Korean people will respond to the American aggressors who commit this heinous atrocity with even greater blows. With an uncontrollable sense of outrage, we demand that the World Federation of Trade Unions and its tens of millions of members take appropriate measures to swiftly stop the atrocities of the American aggressors and severely punish the bacteriological war criminals.

    朝鲜职业总同盟致电世界工联总书记赛扬
    要求制止美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行
    【新华社平壤十一日电】朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会委员长玄勋在八日致电世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬，要求迅速制止美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行，并严厉惩办细菌战犯。电文如下：
    美国侵略者横暴地蹂躏人类道德和国际公约，正在有组织地公开制造着向我们前后方撒布细菌毒虫的杀人暴行。
    美国侵略者在去年曾使用毒气，这激起了全世界爱好自由的人民的愤怒；但是，美帝国主义掠夺者从今年一月二十八日起，又用飞机不断向我前后方大量撒布苍蝇、蚊子、蜘蛛、跳蚤和蚱蜢等带有鼠疫、霍乱等恶性传染病菌的各种昆虫。美国侵略者制造这一罪恶暴行的企图，是要大量虐杀朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军以及和平居民，是要进一步扩大战争。
    全朝鲜人民将以更大的打击来回答制造这一罪恶暴行的美国侵略者。我们以不可抑制的愤怒心情，要求世界工会联合会和它的数千万会员采取适当措施，迅速制止美国侵略者的暴行，并严厉制裁细菌战犯。
