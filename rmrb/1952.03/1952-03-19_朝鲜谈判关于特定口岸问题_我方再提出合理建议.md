Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 18th—At the staff officer meeting on the third item of the Korean armistice negotiations agenda, our side, after considering the other side's opinions on the specific locations of specific ports, proposed designating Sinuiju, Chongjin, Hungnam, Manpo, and Sinanju as our specific ports; and designating Busan, Incheon, Suwon, Gangneung, and Gunsan as the specific ports within the other side's military control area. Our side pointed out that both sides have clearly agreed that each side will have five specific ports, and have agreed that the scope of each specific port will be the urban area of that port, and the points of import belonging to that urban area used for the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of weapons and ammunition, as well as the channels connecting the urban area of that port with these points of import. Therefore, it is impossible to include another port within a specific port, which would effectively overturn the agreement on the number of five specific ports. Pyongyang is not an import port, and our side does not intend to use it as an import port of any nature during the armistice. Our side absolutely cannot agree to the other side's suggestion to include Pyongyang as one of our five ports.
    At the staff officer meeting on the fourth item of the agenda, our side's staff officers raised some questions regarding the other side's statement at the March 16th meeting, requesting the other side to clarify. The other side agreed to take it back for study and provide further explanation and reply.

    朝鲜谈判关于特定口岸问题
    我方再提出合理建议
    【新华社开城十八日电】朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方在特定口岸的具体地点的问题上考虑了对方的意见后，提出将我方特定口岸规定为新义州、清津、兴南、满浦与新安州；将对方军事控制地区内的特定口岸规定为釜山、仁川、水原、江陵与群山。我方指出双方已明确协议每方特定口岸为五个，并协议每一特定口岸的范围为这一口岸的市区，及属于这一市区用于进入军事人员的轮换与武器弹药的替换的进口点，以及联接这一口岸市区与这些进口点的通道，因此就不可能在一个特定口岸中包括另一口岸，而实际上推翻了五个特定口岸的数目的协议。平壤向非进口口岸，在停战期间我方亦不准备利用之为任何性质的进口口岸。我方完全不能同意对方将平壤列入我方五个口岸之一的建议。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，我方参谋人员就对方在三月十六日会议上所作发言提出一些问题，要求对方澄清。对方同意携回研究，再作解释和答复。
