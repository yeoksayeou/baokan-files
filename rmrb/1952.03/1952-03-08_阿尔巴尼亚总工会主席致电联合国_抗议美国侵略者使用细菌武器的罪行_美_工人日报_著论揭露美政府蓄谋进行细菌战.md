Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, March 5th: The Chairman of the Central Committee of the Albanian General Confederation of Trade Unions, Piriştli, on behalf of the Albanian working class, cabled the United Nations to protest the use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressors in Korea. The cable pointed out: The American criminals have committed despicable and shameless acts, trampling on all international agreements. The cable demanded that the United Nations ban the use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressors.

Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: The American "Daily Worker," in commenting on the facts revealed regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressors in Korea, proves that the American aggressors' attempt to use bacteria for aggressive war has been premeditated for a long time. TASS, New York, March 6th, quoted the newspaper's commentary as saying: Considering these things, it is all the more ominous to recall that in 1925, among all the major powers, only Washington and Tokyo refused to ratify the Geneva Convention against bacteriological warfare. In 1946, President Truman did not allow the U.S. Senate to give any consideration to the Geneva Convention against bacteriological warfare, which had already been placed on the agenda. In the United Nations, Washington's spokesmen similarly opposed any consideration of this issue. President Roosevelt had guaranteed in 1943 that the United States would not use bacteriological weapons unless the enemy used them first. However, according to the "New York American Journal" of October 31, 1951, the Pentagon (i.e., the U.S. Department of Defense) now feels that this view is "impractical and harmful."

    美“工人日报”著论揭露美政府蓄谋进行细菌战
    【新华社七日讯】据电通社地拉那五日讯：阿尔巴尼亚总工会中央委员会主席皮里斯特利代表阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级致电联合国，抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜使用细菌武器。电文指出：美国罪犯们已做出了卑鄙无耻的行为，蹂躏了一切国际协定。电文要求联合国禁止美国侵略者使用细菌武器。
    【新华社七日讯】美国“工人日报”在评论美国侵略者在朝鲜使用细菌武器时所揭发的事实，证明美国侵略者企图利用细菌进行侵略战争是蓄谋已久的事。塔斯社纽约六日电引该报评论称：就这些事情看来，回想一下，在一九二五年，所有的大国中只有华盛顿和东京不肯批准反对细菌战争的日内瓦公约就更加使人觉得不祥了。在一九四六年，杜鲁门总统不让美国参议院对已经列入议程的反对细菌战争的日内瓦公约作任何考虑。在联合国，华盛顿的发言人同样反对关于这个问题的一切考虑。罗斯福总统在一九四三年曾保证过，除非敌人先使用了细菌武器，否则美国不会使用细菌武器。但是，据一九五一年十月三十一日的“纽约美国人日报”说，五角大楼（即美国国防部）现在觉得，这种看法是“不实际的，并且是有害的”。
