    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 22nd: TASS reports: The Executive Committee of the Japan Peace Committee issued a statement on March 12th, protesting the "Administrative Agreement" concluded by the Japanese and U.S. governments. The statement pointed out that this agreement was concluded in violation of the will of the Japanese people, and without even consulting the Diet, with the aim of turning all of Japan into a military base for the U.S. military. The statement further said that this agreement poses a threat to peace and makes Japan subordinate to the United States.
    The Japan Peace Committee calls on the Japanese people to unite and fight against the humiliating separate peace treaty and the so-called "Security Treaty."

    反对日美“行政协定”
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社东京讯：日本拥护和平委员会执行委员会在三月十二日发表声明，抗议日美两国政府缔结的“行政协定”。声明指出：这个协定是违反日本人民意志、甚至未与国会商讨即行缔结的，其目的在于把整个日本变成美国军队的军事基地。声明进一步说：这项协定对和平造成威胁，使日本从属于美国。
    日本拥护和平委员会号召日本人民联合起来，进行反对屈辱的单独和约和所谓“安全条约”的斗争。
