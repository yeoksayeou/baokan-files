"Everyone Says They Should Be Killed"
　　 金克木
Our most beloved people have been harmed by insidious means. A group of utterly wicked merchants are secretly undermining the heroic soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in various ways. These merchants have effectively become national traitors serving American imperialism, shameless betrayers who are enemies of the entire Chinese people and the people of the world. These dregs should be charged with the crime of "enemies of the people" and sentenced to the most severe punishment. They are precisely the criminals that "everyone says they should be killed."

From the crimes of the merchants who secretly harmed the Volunteer Army, it is not difficult for us to see the ferocious extent of the bourgeoisie's wild attacks on our great motherland. They not only use "sugar-coated bullets" to attack our revolutionary cadres, but also use rotten cotton, rancid beef, bad eggs, bad biscuits, bad shovels, bad wires, fake medicines, etc. to directly attack our People's Volunteer Army who are defending us. For the sake of "making huge profits," they harmed some revolutionary soldiers who had never fallen on the battlefield or in enemy courts. For the sake of "profit upon profit," they harmed some Volunteer Army soldiers that even American imperialism had failed to kill. Can the Chinese people allow such things to continue without imposing severe punishment and resolute retaliation? Absolutely not.

Are there still people who doubt the bourgeoisie's attacks? Then, how do they explain the treacherous acts of these merchants? Are there still people who cannot bring themselves to hate embezzlers and thieves? Then, how do they view these national sinners who stab the Volunteer Army in the back? Are there still people who are indifferent to the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy? Then, do they still want to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country? Are there still people who feel that our response to the bourgeoisie is "excessive"? Then, do they think that merchants sabotaging national defense projects and even secretly harming the Volunteer Army is not excessive?

The fierce struggle against the illegal behavior and decadent thinking of the bourgeoisie is a test of our standpoint. Do we stand on the side of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, and the People's Volunteer Army? Or do we stand on the side of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang? Do we want our great motherland to be independent and prosperous? Or do we want our motherland to be destroyed and regress to a colonial status? Every Chinese person, including those of the bourgeoisie, must seriously consider this. Our attitude towards the current struggle demonstrates our standpoint. It is either this side or that side.

The bombs of American imperialism are about to fall on our heads, and their machine guns are about to strafe us. The Volunteer Army stepped forward bravely, blocking the enemy's bombs and bullets for our peaceful lives. Now, some people are putting germs on their glorious wounds, adding rotten things to their food, and sabotaging their combat equipment in various ways. Can we be indifferent to this? We increase production, practice thrift, make donations, and go to the front lines to comfort those who are killing the enemy; yet the merchants actually steal a portion of this and put it into their own pockets. Can we be unconcerned about this? We absolutely cannot tolerate this crime. We demand that the government severely punish these merchants, and we must work together to completely wipe out these criminals.

Workers, peasants, soldiers, model laborers, and combat heroes work diligently for their country in wind and rain, in freezing cold and snow, rising early and sleeping late, shedding blood and sweat. Without even comparing them to the bourgeoisie, just look at our youth, our students. In the current great movement, they have been able to work without complaint, without caring about working conditions, single-mindedly focused on struggle and victory, full of optimism and confidence, unafraid of setbacks, and always smiling; they already know how to closely link the future of the motherland with their own future; they demand work, they demand to "go to the front lines," they hate corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and despise the bourgeoisie's selfish and self-interested thinking; they want to integrate with the workers, peasants, soldiers, and the working people, and strive for new democratic construction and the socialist future.

Now look at those thieves and merchants. They only care about their money bags and disregard the motherland; they are single-mindedly thinking of gaining without working; they steal national wealth for their own decadent lives; they are willing to kill for money, even killing those who protect them, killing those who saved them; they only want to get rich, get even richer, and "make a lot of money every day," they are day and night racking their brains to evade taxes, reduce labor and materials, and entice cadres to go astray; they welcome corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, if we allow them to develop without restriction, we will lose our country's independence and lose the beautiful future of our motherland.

One side's slogan is "Everything for the Motherland." The other side's favorite phrase is "Let's make a fortune first." Who is the master of the new China? Who is the sinner of the new China? Does China want more Qu Yaoli and Hao Jianxiu, or more Liu Yuanjing and Li Yinting? Are the answers to these questions still not clear and certain?

The best example of selfless devotion is the People's Volunteer Army; the extreme manifestation of harming the public for personal gain is this group of merchants who secretly harm the Volunteer Army. We demand that the government severely punish these heinous traitors!

    “国人皆曰可杀”
    金克木
    我们的最可爱的人遭遇到暗害了。一群万恶的奸商暗地里从各方面陷害人民志愿军的英勇战士。这些奸商实际已经成了为美帝国主义服务的卖国贼，成了与全国人民和全世界人民为敌的无耻叛徒。对这些败类应该加上“人民公敌”的罪名，处以极刑。他们正是“国人皆曰可杀”的罪犯。
    从奸商暗害志愿军的罪行中，我们不难看出，资产阶级对我们伟大祖国的猖狂进攻的凶恶程度。他们不仅用“糖衣炮弹”攻打我们的革命干部，而且用烂棉花、臭牛肉、坏鸡蛋、坏饼干、坏铁锹、坏电线、假药等等来直接进攻保卫我们的人民志愿军。为了“一本万利”，他们害了一些从来在战场上和敌人法庭上没有倒下过的革命战士。为了“利上加利”，他们又害了一些美帝国主义所未能害死的志愿军战士。中国人民能够容许这样的事继续下去，而不加以严厉的惩罚和坚决的反击么？断然是不能的。
    有人还怀疑资产阶级的进攻么？那么，他们怎样解释这些奸商的背叛行为？有人对贪污犯和盗窃犯还仇恨不起来么？那么，他们怎样看待这些在志愿军背后戳上一刀的民族罪人？有人对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动还漠不关心么？那么，他们究竟还要不要抗美援朝保家卫国？有人还觉得我们对资产阶级的回击“过分”么？那么，他们是不是认为奸商破坏国防工程甚至暗害志愿军并不算过分？
    对资产阶级不法行为和腐朽思想的激烈斗争，就是我们的立场的考验。我们是站在毛主席、中国共产党、人民解放军和人民志愿军一边呢？还是站在美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮一边？我们是愿意我们的伟大祖国独立富强呢？还是愿意祖国遭受破坏，倒退回殖民地地位？每一个中国人，包括资产阶级的人在内，都要郑重地考虑一下。我们对当前斗争的态度就表明我们的立场。不是这一边，就是那一边。
    美帝国主义的炸弹要落到我们头上，机关枪要扫射到我们身上。志愿军挺身而起，为我们的和平生活挡住了敌人的炸弹枪弹。现在却有人在他们的光荣创伤上放毒菌，在他们的粮食里加腐败东西，在他们的作战工具上作种种破坏。我们对此能够无动于衷？我们增产、节约、捐献、到前线去慰劳杀敌；奸商居然要偷去一把，装进他们自己的口袋，我们对此能够毫不在意？我们断然不能容忍这种罪行。我们要求政府严厉制裁这些奸商，我们要共同来彻底扑灭这些罪犯。
    工农兵、劳动模范、战斗英雄，在风里雨里，冰天雪地，起早睡晚，流血流汗，为自己的国家辛勤工作。且不必引他们和资产阶级相比，就看看我们的青年，我们的学生吧。他们在当前的伟大运动中已经能够毫无怨言地工作，毫不计较工作情况，一心只想斗争和胜利，充满乐观和信心，不怕挫折而笑口常开；他们已经知道把祖国前途和自己前途紧紧结合到一起；他们要求工作，他们要求“上前线”，他们痛恨贪污、浪费、官僚主义，憎恶资产阶级自私自利的思想；他们要和工农兵劳动人民打成一片，为新民主主义建设和社会主义前途而奋斗。
    再看看那些盗窃分子和奸商吧。他们只要钱口袋而不顾祖国；他们一心想不劳而获；他们为自己过腐烂的生活而盗窃国家财富；他们为赚钱而不惜杀人，甚至杀到保卫他们的人，杀到救他们的恩人；他们只要发财再发财，“日进斗金”，他们日夜为偷税，漏税，偷工减料，拉拢干部下水而费尽心机；他们欢迎贪污、浪费、官僚主义，如果放任他们发展而不加以限制，我们就会丧失自己祖国的独立，丧失祖国的美丽前途。
    一边的口号是“一切为了祖国”。一边的口头禅是“先赚他一大笔再说”。谁是新中国的主人？谁是新中国的罪人？中国是要多出一些曲耀离、郝建秀，还是要再出刘元敬、李寅廷？这些问题的答案现在还不明白确定么？
    大公无私的最好的榜样是人民志愿军；损公利私的极端表现就是暗害志愿军的这一群奸商。我们要求政府严惩这些罪大恶极的叛徒！
