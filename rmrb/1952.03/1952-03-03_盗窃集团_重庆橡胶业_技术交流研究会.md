    Theft Ring—Chongqing Rubber Industry "Technology Exchange Research Association"
    Lu Yun
    The "Technology Exchange Research Association" of the Chongqing rubber industry is an illegal organization that uses the guise of "technical research" to steal state property. All nine rubber factories in Chongqing participated in this group that stole state wealth. Over the past two years, this theft ring has stolen an estimated minimum of 20 billion yuan or more of state assets from processing orders totaling approximately 65 billion yuan from military supply departments and state-owned enterprise departments.
    What "technology" does the "Technology Exchange Research Association" "research"? It's how to corrupt revolutionary cadres, how to falsely report raw material costs, how to overestimate raw material usage, and how to cut corners, etc. In short, it's "researching" how to steal state assets.
    The main culprits of this theft ring are Chen Weixin, director of the Zhongnan Rubber Factory
    (arrested), manager Wu Zhongqin, Xiao Boxiu, general manager of Lihua Rubber Factory's head office and manager of the Chongqing factory, deputy manager Wang Zhongchi, and factory director Sun Shitai (arrested). These five people formed the core of this theft ring. Their division of labor was: Sun Shitai, proficient in technology, specialized in raising valuations and researching the use of inferior goods and cutting corners. In order to buy off small factories so that the "truth" of the high cost estimates would not be exposed during the valuation process, a very small portion of large processing orders was distributed to small factories. Wu Zhongqin and Wang Zhongchi then used the small factories to compete for prices externally. Wu and Wang also plotted to corrupt cadres, so that the conspiracy to overestimate costs and cut corners could be smoothly implemented. Chen Weixin and Xiao Boxiu put on the guise of "democratic人士" , sang a duet, directed the overall situation, and adapted to the situation to prevent the theft methods from revealing even the slightest flaw.
    The specific methods of theft by this group of unscrupulous merchants are generally as follows: When undertaking each batch of orders, the "Technology Exchange Research Association" first holds a meeting to "research" the "technology" of stealing state assets. Sun Shitai drafts the inflated prices and hints at them to small factories. During the consultation and contract signing, Sun Shitai asks for exorbitant prices, and other small factories echo, emphasizing difficulties and clamoring "high costs, can't do it". Finally, Chen Weixin comes forward and says a few high-sounding words. On the one hand, he hopes that the government will take care of the difficulties of small factories, and on the other hand, he hopes that "the industry" will value the "glorious task", using "how the government supports us, we should never have the idea of profiteering" to "persuade" small factories. At this time, Chen Weixin takes out the estimated price that he and Sun Shitai had decided on earlier and reads it out. The small factories then express their willingness to accept Chen Weixin's opinion and sign a contract with the ordering department. The characteristic of this valuation is that it not only falsely reports the cost of raw materials (such as overestimating the price of the main raw material, raw rubber, by up to 50%), but also overestimates the amount of raw materials used (such as overestimating the raw rubber requirement for every 10,000 pairs of semi-transparent rubber soles by 600 to 900 catties).
    After the contract is signed, the "technology" "researched" by the factories turns to how to cut corners while making it invisible on the surface. Generally, inferior goods are used as good goods. For example, the main raw material, raw rubber, is replaced with smoked rubber scraps instead of smoked rubber sheets; soil sulfur is used instead of sublimed sulfur; pine smoke is used instead of carbon black; crude oleic acid is used instead of stearic acid; type A zinc oxide powder is used instead of special zinc oxide powder, etc. Standard samples are sent when negotiating prices, but during manufacturing, even the molds are secretly changed to shorten the size and thickness. The specifications agreed upon by the factories and the ordering department are not made known to the workers. The shoes made have corners cut and materials reduced from the sole to the edge, the upper, the buckle, and the shoelaces.
    In order to make the theft go more smoothly, this theft ring also used various despicable means to corrupt cadres. Wu Zhongqin once used 8 million yuan to bribe Huang Kecheng and Tao Zhizheng, cost accountants of the procurement section of the factory management office of the logistics department of the Southwest Military Region. Some inspectors were also bought off by them.
    The illegal capitalists stole more than 20 billion yuan of state wealth from processing orders with this so-called "technology". The Zhongnan and Lihua factories did the most for each processing order, accounting for more than 90% of the stolen figures. The above figures are only the direct losses suffered by the state, and the indirect losses cannot be estimated. Due to cutting corners, many rubber shoes were already stuck together in a pile before they reached their destination, becoming waste products; many rubber shoes, when worn by soldiers, were either the wrong size or quickly degummed.
    In Chongqing's eighty-eight industries, more than thirty illegal organizations with the purpose of theft, similar to this one, have been discovered. Ironclad facts tell people: The bourgeoisie's rampant attacks are organized and planned actions. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 盗窃集团—重庆橡胶业“技术交流研究会”

    盗窃集团—重庆橡胶业“技术交流研究会”
    卢云
    重庆橡胶业的“技术交流研究会”，是一个打着“研究技术”的招牌来盗窃国家财产的非法组织。重庆全市九家橡胶厂都参加了这个盗窃国家财富的集团。两年多来，这个盗窃集团在承接军需部门和国营企业部门总值六百五十亿元左右的加工定货中，盗窃国家资财据估计最少在二百亿元以上。
    “技术交流研究会”所“研究”的是什么“技术”呢？是如何腐蚀革命干部，如何谎报原料成本，如何估高原料用量和如何偷工减料等等。总之，是“研究”如何盗窃国家资财。
    这一个盗窃集团的首犯是中南橡胶厂厂长陈维新
    （已被捕）、经理吴中钦、利华橡胶厂总公司总经理兼重庆厂经理萧伯修、副经理王仲篪、厂长孙世泰（已被捕）。这五个人组成了这个盗窃集团的核心，他们的分工是：孙世泰精通技术，专司抬高估价，研究掺用劣货和偷工减料。为了买通小厂，使得在估价的时候不致戳穿高估成本的“真相”，在每次大批的加工定货中分出极少部分给小厂做，由吴中钦、王仲篪利用小厂向外争价。吴、王两人并设计腐蚀干部，使高估成本和偷工减料的阴谋得以顺利实现。陈维新、萧伯修便披上“民主人士”的外衣，合唱双簧，指挥全局，临机应变，不使盗窃的手段露出丝毫的破绽。
    这伙奸商盗窃的具体办法一般是：在承接每一批定货时，“技术交流研究会”先开会“研究”盗窃国家资财的“技术”，由孙世泰拟好高估的价格，暗示小厂。在会商订合同的时候，孙世泰就漫天要价，其他小厂附和强调困难，叫嚣“成本高，做不到”。最后由陈维新出面讲几句冠冕堂皇的话，一方面希望政府照顾小厂困难，一方面希望“同业”重视“光荣任务”，用“政府如何扶持我们，我们决不应有暴利思想”来“说服”小厂。这时，陈维新把早和孙世泰决定下的估价拿出来宣读一番，小厂于是表示愿意接受陈维新的意见，和定货部门签订合同。这个估价的特点，不仅谎报原料成本（如主要原料的生胶价格高估达百分之五十），并估高原料用量（如把每万双半透明胶底的生胶需要量多估六百斤到九百斤）。
    订立合同以后，各厂“研究”的“技术”即转向如何偷工减料，还要在表面上看不出来。一般的都是以次货充好货。如主要原料生胶以烟胶碎代烟胶片；以土硫磺代替升华硫磺；松烟代炭黑；粗脂酸代硬脂酸；甲种锌氧粉代特种锌氧粉等。议价时送的是标准样品，但制造时却连模子也偷偷地改了，以缩短尺寸和厚度。各厂和定货部门所订的规格都不使工人知道。做出来的鞋子从鞋底到鞋边，鞋面、鞋扣、鞋带都偷了工、减了料。
    这个盗窃集团为了使盗窃进行得更顺手，还用各种卑鄙手段来腐蚀干部。吴中钦曾用八百万元买通了西南军区后勤军需部工厂管理处采购科的成本会计员黄克诚、陶志正。有些验货员也被他们收买。
    不法资本家就以这样的所谓“技术”，从加工定货中盗窃了国家财富两百亿元以上。每一笔加工定货都是中南和利华两厂做得最多，在盗窃的数字中两厂共占百分之九十以上。上面的数字还只是国家直接受到的损失，间接的损失还无法估计。由于偷工减料，很多胶鞋在未运抵目的地以前，已经互相黏附成一团，成为废品；很多胶鞋穿上战士的脚后，不是尺寸不合，就是脱胶很快。
    在重庆八十八个行业中，类似这样的以盗窃为目的的非法组织，已经发现了三十多个。铁一般的事实告诉人们：资产阶级的猖狂进攻，是有组织有计划的行动。（新华社）
