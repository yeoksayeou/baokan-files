Yang Shunkui is a liberated farmer from Da Lieshu Village, Ninth District, Chicheng County, Chahar Province. In this village, dry land and slopes account for about 85% of the total cultivated area, and they are frequently affected by drought, resulting in generally low yields. In 1951, the area suffered a severe drought, yielding only 40% of a normal year. However, Yang Shunkui and the mutual aid team he led achieved a bumper harvest because they emphasized moisture retention and drought prevention. The team cultivated a total of 87 mu of millet, sorghum, rice, corn, and sweet potatoes, with an average yield of 296 jin of raw grain per mu, 106 jin more than ordinary households growing the same crops. Yang Shunkui himself cultivated 16 mu of land, with even higher yields. Among them, 1.8 mu of dry land millet produced 1,424 jin, equivalent to 790 jin per mu, exceeding the local average yield by five times. This is a relatively high record nationwide.

Yang Shunkui's main experience in achieving high yields of dry land millet lies in his attention to improving techniques in land preparation, inter-tillage, fertilization, and seed selection, as well as preventing drought and retaining moisture.

In land preparation, he implemented early plowing, deep plowing, frequent harrowing, and fine leveling, closely integrating plowing, harrowing, and leveling, doing them immediately one after another. After the autumn harvest, he immediately did a shallow plowing (about four cun deep), followed by two harrowings and levelings, making the topsoil very fine, loose, and soft, reducing moisture evaporation. After the Frost's Descent solar term, the sunlight gradually weakened, and evaporation decreased, so he first applied fertilizer and then carried out the second plowing, harrowing, and leveling. The plowing depth could reach five cun, turning the topsoil and fertilizer rich in organic matter underneath to improve moisture retention capacity; turning the subsoil on top could be weathered by the winter wind. In early spring, when the ground thawed to a depth of four to five fen, he first rolled it with a roller to make the soil particles fine, dense, and tightly bound, preventing wind erosion. This has a certain effect on retaining moisture. After the Grain Rain solar term, he applied a large amount of fertilizer, followed by shallow plowing four cun deep, then harrowing and leveling, and immediately sowed the seeds while the soil was still moist. Because he brought forward the land preparation work to the autumn and winter seasons when the evaporation rate was lower, the soil was sufficiently moist, so he could still ensure timely sowing and full emergence under the condition of spring drought, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest.

When sowing, he carried out warm water soaking to promote seed germination and prevent the occurrence of smut disease. In 1951, he hoed his millet field five times, two more times than others, and he did it early and shallow, achieving the purpose of reducing soil moisture evaporation. As the saying goes:

"Hoe the millet by an inch, better than applying manure." Hoe the first time when the millet grows to one cun high, only scraping the surface of the ground, weeding, and not thinning the seedlings. Hoe the second time when the seedlings are four to five cun high, only one cun deep, and determine the number of seedlings. Hoe the third time when the seedlings are about one and a half chi high, one to one and a half cun deep, while paying attention to earthing up, so that the surrounding of the seedlings can easily store more moisture. Hoe the fourth time when the millet is pregnant with ears; this is during the dog days, still only scraping the surface of the ground, cutting off the soil capillaries, not allowing moisture to evaporate, and not exposing the wet soil to increase drought resistance. Hoe the fifth time when the millet is flowering and forming grains, still shallow hoeing to retain moisture. The timing of each hoeing depends on the weather changes. Hoe earlier when it is dry, and slightly later when it is waterlogged. These are very suitable for the rules of water conservation and drought prevention in dry land.

In terms of fertilization, he also paid attention to the requirements of retaining and nourishing moisture. At the end of autumn of the previous year, he applied smoked fertilizer made of straw, etc., to increase organic matter in the soil, increase the soil temperature, and easily absorb melted winter snow water. Before sowing, he applied a large amount of cattle and pig manure. This farmyard manure was accumulated from May to October of the previous year, and used only after being piled up and fully fermented through the summer, autumn, and winter seasons. Fresh cattle and pig manure after October is not fully fermented and will generate heat in the soil, reducing the soil's water retention capacity, so it is not used at all. This is also in line with the principle of nourishing moisture in dry land.

In addition, he selected the excellent millet variety "Shanxi White." This variety has strong drought resistance. Under the same environmental and land conditions, it can yield more than 30 jin compared to ordinary local millet varieties. Yang Shunkui carefully carried out continuous seed selection, storing separately, and at the same time paying attention to improving cultivation techniques, which further enhanced the excellent characteristics of this variety.

Yang Shunkui's dry land millet, because of the meticulous attention to improving cultivation techniques, retaining moisture and preventing drought, was able to create a record of high yield in not very fertile dry land. (Wang Dasan)

    察哈尔省丰产模范杨顺奎
    注意保墒防旱保证了旱地谷子丰收
    杨顺奎是察哈尔省赤城县九区大栜树村的翻身农民。这村旱地坡地要占耕地总面积百分之八十五左右，经常遭受旱灾侵袭，一般产量很低；一九五一年那里遭受了严重的旱灾，只有四成多年景。但杨顺奎和他所领导的互助组，因重视了保墒防旱，却获得了丰收。组内共种谷子、高粱、水稻、玉米、甘薯等共八十七亩，每亩平均产原粮二百九十六斤，比一般户同样庄稼多了一百零六斤。杨顺奎自己种的十六亩地，产量更高，其中一亩八分旱地谷子产一千四百二十四斤，每亩折合七百九十斤，超过当地一般产量五倍。这在全国说来，也是比较高的纪录。
    杨顺奎旱地谷子丰产的主要经验，是他在整地、中耕、施肥、选种等方面都注意提高技术，防旱保墒。
    他的谷地在整地上实行早耕、深耕、勤耙、细耱，而且耕、耙、耱紧密结合，随耕、随耙、随耱。他在秋收后，就紧跟着浅耕一次（约四寸深），随即耙、耱两次，使表土十分细碎松软，减少水分蒸发。霜降节过后，阳光渐弱，蒸发减少，就先施一次肥，紧跟着进行第二次耕、耙、耱。耕深可达五寸，使表土和富有有机质的肥料翻在底下，提高保墒能力；底土翻在上面，又可经冬风化。来年春初地解冻四分到五分深时，就用辘轴先压一遍，使土粒细碎密结，阻止风吹。这样做有一定的收墒作用。谷雨节后，就大量施肥，随即进行四寸深的浅耕，再加耙、耱，立刻趁墒下种。由于他把整地工作提早在蒸发率较低的秋冬季进行，使土壤中水分充足，所以在春季干旱的情况下，仍能保证做到适时播种，出苗齐全，打下了丰产的基础。
    播种时他进行了温汤浸种，促进了种籽的发芽，同时也防止了黑穗病的发生。一九五一年，他的谷地锄五遍，比旁人多锄了两遍，并且作到了早锄、浅锄，达到了减少土中水分蒸发的目的。农谚说：
    “谷锄寸，顶上粪”。谷子长到一寸高时锄头遍，仅铲破地皮，光?草，不间苗。苗高四、五寸时，锄第二遍，深仅一寸，定苗。苗高一尺半左右时锄第三遍，深一寸到一寸半，同时注意培土，使苗的周围容易储积更多的水分。谷子孕穗时，锄第四遍；这时正是伏天，仍仅铲破地皮，割断土壤毛细管，不使水分蒸发，不使湿土上露，以增加抗旱效能。谷子扬花后结粒时锄第五遍，仍是浅锄保墒。每次锄地动手的迟早，都根据天气变化的情况而定。旱了早锄，涝了稍晚一点。这些都很适合旱地保水防旱的规律。
    他在施肥方面，也注意了收墒养墒的要求。头年秋末，施用以藁杆等制造的薰肥，使土中有机质增加，地温增高，容易吸收冬雪溶水。播种前施用大量牛粪猪粪。这些厩肥，却是在头年五月到十月间积下的，经过夏、秋、冬三季堆积腐熟后才用。十月以后的新鲜牛粪猪粪尚未充分发酵，用了会在土中生热，减少土壤的保水力，所以一概不用。这也很符合旱地养墒的道理。
    另外，他选种了优良谷种“山西白”。这个品种抗旱力强。在同样环境和土地的条件下，比当地一般谷种能多打三十斤以上。杨顺奎认真地进行了连续选种，单打单藏，同时注意提高栽培技术，就更发挥了这个品种的优良性状。
    杨顺奎的旱地谷子，因为精细地注意了提高耕作技术，保墒防旱，所以能在不算肥沃的旱地里，创造了丰产的纪录。（王达三）
