(Xinhua News Agency, March 21st) TASS Moscow: The American aggressors' despicable crime of launching germ warfare in Korea and China has aroused deep indignation among scientists throughout the Soviet Union. The renowned agrobiologist, Academician Lysenko, told a TASS reporter: "I was greatly angered upon learning of the terrible crime of the American aggressors, who disregarded international conventions and used bacteriological weapons against the peaceful residents of Korea and China. True scientists have spent centuries studying methods to eradicate plague, cholera, and typhus. They often sacrifice their own lives to save people from terrible diseases. What a low point the American 'scientists' have sunk to, inventing tools for the mass slaughter of women, children, and the elderly!"

Soviet scientists, who have dedicated all their efforts to protecting human life, indignantly protest the act of mass slaughter of peaceful people. They take as their motto the words of the great Stalin: "Man is the most valuable and decisive capital in the world." The germ warfare must be stopped immediately. Reactionary elements in the scientific community who use their knowledge for the mass destruction of humanity in order to pander to the imperialists must be severely punished.

Hero of Socialist Labor, leader of Soviet chemists, Academician Zelinsky, said: "The crimes of the American aggressors violate the basic principles of human morality and the norms of international law. Soviet microbiologists, the greatest humanitarians, study microbiology with the aim of preventing diseases and making human life happier. Soviet scientists maintain the glorious humanitarian tradition of Soviet science, making microbiology serve the peaceful life of the people. They have saved countless working people from death. We Soviet scientists express our angry protest against the actions of the American bandits. We believe that the World Peace Council will do everything possible to stop germ warfare."

Academician Anichkov, President of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, said: "The heinous crimes of the American aggressors are even more abominable than those committed by the Hitlerite bandits. This crime particularly infuriates medical workers—representatives of the most humane science. Soviet medical science is proud of the fact that it has victoriously prevented terrible infectious diseases. Certain epidemics, such as smallpox, cholera, and plague, have been completely eradicated in the Soviet Union. The American aggressors, enemies of humanity, pay lip service to peace while actually engaging in despicable and shameful acts through their tamed tool—the United Nations. And in this, they are assisted by so-called scientists who no longer have the right to call themselves scientists, who have forgotten that science should only promote progress. Our deep anger at the criminal actions of the American aggressors is beyond words. These criminals, who have trampled on the most sublime humanitarian principles, will not escape the punishment they deserve."

Renowned mathematician Academician Khristianovich, Professor Beve, President of the Latvian Academy of Sciences, Madulis, President of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, and other prominent Soviet scientists have all issued statements condemning the American aggressors' lackeys for turning the science of life—biology—into the science of death, demanding that the unprecedented barbarity of the American aggressors be stopped, and that the germ warfare criminals be punished.

(Xinhua News Agency, March 20th) TASS Moscow, March 19th: Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, renowned Soviet pediatrician Spiransky, said in an interview with a TASS reporter: "The world knows the untold suffering caused by wars throughout history. It is for this reason that people have established laws of war. International conventions prohibit the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons. But the universally recognized laws are considered meaningless by the American government, by the likes of Truman and Acheson. In pursuit of their vile goals, the American barbarians do not hesitate to use such terrible weapons, which even the Hitlerite gangs dared not use. In order to slaughter the peace-loving Korean people who are fighting for their independence, they have begun to use bacteriological weapons."

"I am a pediatrician, and I know that when any infectious disease is discovered in a country, children are often the first to suffer. The American imperialists use bacteriological weapons to bring disease and death to children—the hope of humanity. The thought of this fills one with righteous indignation. Those scientists who serve as accomplices to the barbaric crimes of the American imperialists have forgotten that the mission of science has always been to promote the progress and happiness of the people. Their knowledge, utilized by American warmongering generals, has become a tool of dark reaction. They have become the executioners of the Korean people and are no longer worthy of being called scientists."

"Like all Soviet people, I protest the crimes of the American aggressors on the soil of Korea and China."

    苏联著名科学家李森科、齐林斯基等发表谈话
    愤怒抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行
    并痛斥美国科学界中反动分子充当美国细菌战犯的帮凶
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国发动细菌战的可耻罪行，引起了全苏联科学家的深切愤怒。著名农业生物学家，科学院院士李森科对塔斯社记者说：我在得悉美国侵略者不顾国际公约、对朝鲜和中国的和平居民使用细菌武器的可怕罪行以后，大为震怒。真正的科学家已花了几百年时间研究扑灭鼠疫、霍乱和斑疹伤寒的方法。他们为了使人民免罹可怕的疾病，常常牺牲自己的生命。美国的“科学家”却发明大规模屠杀妇女儿童和老年人的工具，他们已经堕落到多么下贱的地步了啊！
    为保卫人类生命而贡献出全部力量的苏联科学家，都愤慨地抗议大规模屠杀和平人民的行为。他们把伟大的斯大林所说的一句话当作座右铭，这句话就是：“人是世界上所有一切宝贵资本中最宝贵最有决定意义的资本。”必须立即结束细菌战。必须严惩那些为了奉迎帝国主义者而把他们的知识用来大规模毁灭人类的科学界的反动分子。
    社会主义劳动英雄、苏联化学家领袖、科学院院士齐林斯基说：美国侵略者的罪行违反了人类道德的基本原则和国际法准则。苏联微生物学家们，这些最伟大的人道主义者，是抱着预防疾病、使人类的生活更加幸福的目的来研究微生物学的。苏联科学家保持着苏联科学的光荣的人道主义传统，使微生物学为人民的和平生活服务。他们已经拯救了无数劳动人民，使他们免于死亡。我们苏联科学家对于美国强盗的行为表示愤怒的抗议。我们相信世界和平理事会将尽一切能力来制止细菌战争。
    苏联医药科学院院长阿尼契科夫院士说：美国侵略者的滔天罪行比希特勒匪徒犯的罪行还要可恶。他们这种罪行，使医药工作者——最人道的科学的代表，特别感到愤怒。苏联的医药科学能够自豪的是它已经胜利地防止了可怖的传染病。某些疫病，如天花、霍乱和鼠疫，在苏联已经完全绝迹。美国侵略者这个人类的敌人只是口头上装模作样地谈和平，实际上是凭借着他们驯服的工具——联合国，在干着卑鄙可耻的勾当。而在这事情当中，他们获得所谓科学家的协助，这些人其实已经没有权利再自称为科学家，他们已经忘记了科学应该只是促进进步的。我们对美国侵略者的罪恶行动所感到的深切愤怒，是言词所不足以表达的。这些践踏了最崇高的人道原则的罪犯们，逃脱不了他们应得的惩罚。
    名数学家赫利斯奇安诺维奇院士、拉脱维亚科学院院长贝威教授、立陶宛科学院院长马杜力斯和其他著名苏联科学家都发表声明，斥责美国侵略者的奴仆们把生命的科学——生物学变成了死亡的科学，要求制止美国侵略者这种空前的野蛮行为，并惩办细菌战犯。
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：苏联科学院通讯院士、苏联著名儿科医师斯皮兰斯基，在接见塔斯社记者时说：世界是知道历来战争所造成的不可胜计的苦难的。就是为了这个原因，人民才提出了战争的法律。国际公约禁止使用化学武器和细菌武器。但是众所共认的法律，在美国政府，杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流看来是不当一回事的。美国野蛮人为了追逐他们的卑劣目的，不惜使用这种甚至连希特勒匪帮也不敢使用的可怕武器。为了杀戮正在为独立而作战的爱好和平的朝鲜人民，他们开始使用了细菌武器。
    我是一个小儿科专家，我知道当一个国家中发现了任何传染病时，儿童常是最先受难者。美帝国主义者使用细菌武器，为儿童——人类的希望——带来疾病和死亡。想起这事，不禁使人义愤填膺。那些充当美帝国主义者野蛮罪行的帮凶的科学家，已经忘记了科学的使命一直就是使人民进步和幸福。他们的知识被美国黩武将领利用，已经成为黑暗反动派的工具。他们已经成为屠杀朝鲜人民的刽子手，不再配自称为科学家了。
    我和全体苏联人民一样，抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国土地上的罪行。
