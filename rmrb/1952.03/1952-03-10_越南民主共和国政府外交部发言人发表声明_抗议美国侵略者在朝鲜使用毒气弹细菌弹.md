    Xinhua News Agency, 9th: According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, 8th: The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement protesting the use of napalm bombs, poison gas bombs, and germ bombs by the American aggressors in Korea. The statement is as follows: Like the French colonialists in Vietnam, the American aggressors have become more and more cruel after suffering increasingly heavy defeats in Korea. Recently, American planes have been continuously dropping napalm bombs, poison gas bombs, and other bombs with dangerous germs in an attempt to kill the Korean people. This barbaric act of the American aggressors shamelessly violates all international laws and conventions. This barbaric act exposes the hideous features of the American aggressors, who are even more savage than the Hitler fascist bandits. This barbaric act has aroused the indignation of people all over the world, especially the Vietnamese people, towards the imperialist aggressors, and prompted them to more actively support the heroic struggle of the Korean people for independence and freedom. We strongly protest against this new crime of the American imperialists. We are convinced that no matter how cruel the American aggressors are, the Korean people and army will more actively fight side by side with the Chinese People's Volunteers to eliminate the American aggressors.

    抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜使用毒气弹细菌弹
    【新华社九日讯】据越南通讯社北越八日消息：越南民主共和国政府外交部发言人发表声明，抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜使用凝固汽油弹、毒气弹和细菌弹。声明如下：和在越南的法国殖民者一样，美国侵略者在朝鲜遭受了愈来愈惨重的失败以后，一天比一天残忍。最近美国飞机竟不断投掷凝固汽油弹、毒气弹和其他带有危险毒菌的炸弹，企图杀害朝鲜人民。美国侵略者的这种野蛮行为，无耻地破坏了一切国际法和国际规约。这种野蛮行为暴露了甚至比希特勒法西斯匪徒更加野蛮的美国侵略者的狰狞面目。这种野蛮行为已引起全世界人民、特别是越南人民对帝国主义侵略者的愤恨，并促使他们更加积极地支援朝鲜人民进行争取独立和自由的英勇斗争。我们强烈地抗议美帝国主义者的这种新罪行。我们确信：无论美国侵略者如何残忍，朝鲜人民和军队将愈加积极地和中国人民志愿军并肩作战，消灭美国侵略者。
