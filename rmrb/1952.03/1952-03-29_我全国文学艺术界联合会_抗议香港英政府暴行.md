    All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles
    Protests Atrocities of the British Government in Hong Kong
    [Report from this newspaper] The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, representing all Chinese literary and art workers, lodges a serious protest against the British government in Hong Kong for its unreasonable summons of Chinese journalists in Hong Kong on March 20, 21, and 24. The letter of protest stated: The British government in Hong Kong's sinister purpose in unreasonably summoning ten Chinese journalists is clearly not only an attempt to deprive Chinese residents of freedom of speech, but also the fact that this once again proves that the British government in Hong Kong's atrocities are a planned action by British imperialism in pursuing the aggressive policies of American imperialism. This reactionary behavior of the British government in Hong Kong will only further arouse the Chinese people's hatred of British imperialism. We have sufficient confidence and strength to support the just struggle of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong until the final victory.

    我全国文学艺术界联合会
    抗议香港英政府暴行
    【本报讯】中华全国文学艺术界联合会，代表全中国文学艺术工作者，对香港英国政府先后在三月二十、二十一、二十四日无理传讯我国在香港的新闻工作者的暴行，提出严重抗议。抗议书中说：香港英国政府无理传讯我国十位新闻工作者的罪恶目的，显然不仅是企图剥夺我国居民的言论自由，而且这一事实，再次证明了香港英国政府的暴行，是英帝国主义追随美帝国主义侵略政策的有计划的行动。香港英国政府的这种反动行为，只会更加激起中国人民对英帝国主义的愤恨。我们有足够的信心和力量支持香港爱国同胞的正义斗争，直到最后胜利。
