    The phenomenon of wasting manpower should be opposed
    Editor: I fully support the State Council's decision on adjusting institutions and streamlining staffing, published in the People's Daily on December 15, 1951. In some departments, there is indeed a serious phenomenon of wasting manpower. In the Chemical Industry Bureau of our Ministry of Heavy Industry, some staff members engage in three major activities after coming to work: drinking tea, smoking, and reading newspapers. The work is very "leisurely." When an intern was being transferred, someone asked him how much work he had done in a year. The comrade answered very frankly: "I read books for a year!" Of course, we are not opposed to reading books, but we are opposed to the phenomenon of having nothing to do during working hours. This is a waste of national manpower. If each person wastes an average of two hours a day, and we calculate the average wage of each person in our office to be at least 2,000 yuan per hour, this salary expenditure is considerable. If we calculate it based on similar situations across the country, it would be even more astonishing. Wasting manpower not only causes losses to the people's property, but more importantly, it has a huge impact on the training of a large number of cadres needed for large-scale construction in the future. I suggest that all departments pay attention to opposing the waste of manpower in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.        Chu Yi

    应反对浪费人力的现象
    编辑同志：我完全拥护一九五一年十二月十五日人民日报刊载的政务院关于调整机构紧缩编制的决定。在某些部门中，确实存在着严重的浪费人力的现象。我们重工业部化学工业局里，有些工作人员，上班后进行三件大事，喝茶、抽烟、看报，工作很
    “清闲”。一位实习同志调动工作时，有人问他一年中做了多少工作，这位同志回答得很干脆：“看了一年书！”当然，我们并不反对看书，但我们反对那种在工作时间内无事可做的现象。这是对国家人力的浪费。假如每人每天平均浪费两小时，又以我们机关每人每小时平均工资起码二千元来算，这笔工资的开销就很可观。若以全国类似的情况来算，那就更惊人了。浪费人力不但使人民财产遭受损失，更重要的是对今后大规模开展建设时所需要大批干部的培养，有着极大的影响。我建议各部门在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，注意反对浪费人力的问题。        楚毅
