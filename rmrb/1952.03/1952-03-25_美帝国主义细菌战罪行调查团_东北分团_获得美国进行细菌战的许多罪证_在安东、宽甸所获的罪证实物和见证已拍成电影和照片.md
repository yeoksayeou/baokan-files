Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th. The Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Group on Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism" returned to Shenyang on the 24th after conducting six days of investigations and visits in Andong City and Kuandian County. It will continue its investigation in Fushun and other places in order to further collect evidence of U.S. imperialism's bacteriological warfare. The substantial evidence and witness accounts of U.S. imperialism's bacteriological warfare obtained by the group in Andong and Kuandian have been filmed and photographed on site. The group also collected a large number of specimens of poisonous insects and toxic substances.
Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 24th. After arriving in Andong, the Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Group on Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism" immediately visited residents in various nearby areas who had witnessed American planes spreading bacterial insects; and conducted on-site investigations of bacterial insects and various physical evidence. The group has obtained much conclusive evidence of U.S. imperialism's bacteriological warfare in the Northeast.

    The group saw a large number of bacterial insects spread by U.S. imperialists in various districts of Andong City. On the 18th, the entire group, led by Chen Qiyuan, the head of the group, discovered a large number of poisonous insects, such as mosquitoes, flies, and spiders, along the Yalu River and on the back hill of Dongkanzi in Zhen'an District, Andong City. Shan Wenrong, an office worker living in Dongkanzi, described how he discovered dense swarms of various poisonous insects after American planes invaded the airspace on March 6th. Dong Wenxue, a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, handed over a half bottle of flies carrying bacteria that he had captured on March 6th to the group. Nearby residents Liu Guizhen, Xia Defu, and Zhou Lijun, who were catching poisonous insects, provided the group with strong evidence, proving that these strange insects discovered in early March had never been seen locally.

    On the 19th, the group split into groups to conduct on-site investigations in Langtou District, Wulongbei District of Andong City, and Qianweitangzi Village in the Second District of Andong County. Witnesses who had seen American military aircraft spreading bacterial insects and other physical evidence came to report the discovery of these poisonous insects. Geng Zhenmin, a doctor from the Northeast Anti-Epidemic Institution, saw American planes dropping many white packages from the air while passing through a place half a mile east of the Langtou District Office at 3:30 p.m. on March 11th. Half an hour later, Wang Guofu, a farmer, picked up a white cloth bag on the highway while collecting manure half a mile west of the Langtou District Office. The cloth bag was more than two inches wide and more than three inches long, sewn very tightly, and filled with white crystalline substances the size of corn kernels. When the group went to Pingzhong Street in Langtou District to investigate the area where U.S. imperialism spread bacterial insects, Sun Leren, the leader of the militia in the street, and others said that they saw American planes dropping two white packages and a large number of bacterial insects that dispersed before reaching the ground at 11:00 a.m. on March 4th. Many residents, as witnesses, provided the group with much evidence of U.S. imperialists spreading bacterial insects. The group filmed and photographed the physical evidence on the spot and recorded all the witnesses' statements.

    Tao Hongsheng, a farmer from Nianzigang Village in Wulongbei District, told the group about the situation of American planes spreading poisonous substances, saying: "At 3:00 p.m. on March 11th, I was attending a meeting in the district government compound when I suddenly heard an air raid siren. Liu Yuanbao, another office worker, was the first to see an American plane dropping a white object, which disappeared suddenly after three minutes. Ten minutes later, Liu Yuanbao and I both saw many leaves falling slowly from the air. There was no wind that day, and I ran after the falling leaves and picked up three oak leaves. The local oak leaves had already withered, but these oak leaves were green. We picked up more than fifty pieces in total, and also picked up locust seedlings and corn leaves. On the 13th, Liu Shufan, a teacher at Yingtaizi Village Primary School, two miles away from the district government, also found the same oak leaves on the mountain."

    On March 20th, in addition to a group of experts staying in Andong City to continue studying the evidence of U.S. imperialists spreading bacterial insects, the remaining thirty-six people, led by Chen Qiyuan, the head of the group, went to Kuandian County for on-site investigations. During their stay in the county, the group members saw swarms of poisonous insects and much evidence, and were very angry at the heinous crimes of the American bandits in carrying out bacteriological warfare. Tian Demin, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, and Wang Runfeng, a representative of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, visited local students and workers separately to hear their accusations against U.S. imperialism spreading bacterial insects.

Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 24th. The Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Group on Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism" held an investigation meeting on the evidence of U.S. imperialism's bacteriological warfare in Kuandian County on March 21st. The investigation meeting was presided over by Chen Qiyuan, head of the group, and Mei Ru'ao, an expert in international law, and Zhou Jianren, a biologist. Farmers from Kuandian Town, Changdian District, and Niumaowu District in Kuandian County came to the group to describe in detail the process of U.S. imperialism spreading bacteria.

    Yu Chenglin, a farmer from Sipingjie Village in Changdian District, told the investigation group in detail how he personally saw American planes spreading bacterial insects. At 2:30 p.m. on March 16th, when three American planes passed over at high altitude, he saw the plane drop a black object. The black object gradually descended, and the lower it got, the smaller it became, and then it landed on the back of a nearby hill. At that time, he and eight farmers, including Li Yufa, and four elementary school students tracked and chased after it. When they arrived at the place where the black object landed, they found swarms of flies flying up. These flies had never been seen locally before. Another farmer in the village, Liu Jinghe, described to the group the process of discovering a silvery-white, elaborately made package with five layers of cloth and paper skin dropped by an American plane. He witnessed this remnant part of the container being dropped by a U.S. plane at 12:20 p.m. on March 16th, and he requested the group to use it as evidence to accuse U.S. imperialism of carrying out bacteriological warfare. The farmers attending the meeting unanimously said: A large number of poisonous insects such as flies, mosquitoes, and spiders were found in many places in Kuandian County at the beginning of March, which we have never seen before. In addition to the shape of these insects being very different from the local insects, the time of appearance of these insects was also two or three months earlier than the local insects. Liu Tonglun, a 51-year-old resident outside the South Gate of Kuandian Town, said:
    "The ants dropped by the American planes are larger than the local ants. The earliest local ants can crawl out of their nests every year in June. Now the ground is still frozen and covered with snow. How can the local ants crawl onto the snow? This is obviously the aerial bandits from America spreading them to poison the people." Zou Ziheng, a 62-year-old farmer outside the South Gate of Kuandian Town, said: "I have lived for so long and have never seen so many flies and mosquitoes in the heavy snow in the second month of the lunar calendar. Usually, we don't see flies and mosquitoes here until after the Qingming Festival. I have never seen flies and mosquitoes of this shape from my childhood to now."

    At the end of the investigation meeting, Chen Qiyuan, the head of the Northeast Branch, made a brief speech.

    “美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团
    获得美国进行细菌战的许多罪证
    在安东、宽甸所获的罪证实物和见证已拍成电影和照片
    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团在安东市和宽甸县等地进行六天调查访问后，已在二十四日返沈阳，将继续在抚顺等地进行调查，以便进一步搜集美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪证。该团在安东、宽甸所获得的美帝国主义进行细菌战的大量罪证实物和见证，都在原地拍成电影和照片，该团并采集了大量的毒虫毒物等标本。
    【新华社安东二十四日电】“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团抵达安东后，即到附近各地访问目睹美国飞机撒布细菌毒虫的居民；并实地勘查细菌毒虫和各种物证。该分团已获得美帝国主义在东北进行细菌战的许多确凿罪证。
    该分团在安东市各区看到了美帝国主义者撒布的大量细菌毒虫。十八日，该分团全体人员在团长陈其瑗率领下，在鸭绿江江沿和安东市镇安区东坎子的后山上，发现了大量的蚊子、苍蝇、蜘蛛等多种毒虫。住在东坎子的机关职员单文荣叙述了美国飞机在三月六日侵入该地上空后，他就发现了密集成群的各种毒虫的经过。一位人民解放军的战士董文学将他在三月六日捕捉的半瓶带有细菌的苍蝇送给该分团。正在捕捉毒虫的附近居民刘桂珍、夏德福、周利军等纷纷向该分团提供有力的证据，证明在三月初旬发现的这些奇形怪状的虫子，是当地从来没有见过的。
    该分团在十九日分组前往安东市的浪头区、五龙背区和安东县的第二区前苇塘子村进行实地调查。目睹美国军用飞机撒布细菌毒虫等实物的见证人，都先后赶来报告发现这些毒虫的经过。东北防疫机构的一位医生耿振民在三月十一日午后三时半，路经浪头区公所东半里路的地方，看到美国飞机从空中投下许多白包。相隔半小时后，农民王国福在浪头区公所西半里处拾粪时，在公路上拾到了一个白布包。这个布包有两寸多宽。三寸多长，缝的很细密，里面满装着像苞米粒一样大小的白色结晶体。该分团到浪头区平中街美帝国主义撒布细菌毒虫处调查时，该街民兵中队长孙乐仁等说，在三月四日十一时，他们都看到美国飞机投下两个白包和降到地面以前即行散开的大量细菌毒虫。许多居民以见证人的资格，向该分团提供了美帝国主义者撒布细菌毒虫的许多证据。该分团当场将实物拍摄成电影和照片，并全部地记录了见证人的谈话。
    五龙背区碾子岗村农民陶洪生向该分团人员讲述了美国飞机撒布毒物的经过情形说：“三月十一日午后三时，我正在区政府院内开会时，突然听到空袭警报。另一位机关职员刘元宝首先看见美国飞机投下一个白色的东西，三分钟后忽然不见。又过十分钟，刘元宝和我都看到不少树叶从空中徐徐下落。那天没有一点风，我随着降落的树叶跑去拾到了三片柞树叶。本地的柞树叶早已枯干，但是这些柞树叶的颜色发绿。我们几个人当时一共拾了五十多片，另外还拾到槐树苗和苞米叶。十三日，距区政府二里远的营台子村小学教员刘树藩也在山上发现同样的柞树叶。”
    三月二十日，调查团除留一部分专家在安东市继续研究美帝国主义者撒布细菌毒虫的罪证外，其余一行三十六名在分团团长陈其瑗率领下，赴宽甸县进行实地调查。在该县停留期间，该分团人员看到成群的毒虫和许多证据后，对美国强盗进行细菌战的滔天罪行十分愤怒。中华全国学生联合会主席田德民和中华全国总工会代表王润丰，分头访问当地学生和工人，听取了他们对美帝国主义撒布细菌毒虫的控诉。
    【新华社安东二十四日电】“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团三月二十一日在宽甸县举行美帝国主义细菌战罪证调查会。调查会由该分团团长陈其瑗和国际法学专家梅汝璈、生物学专家周建人等主持。宽甸县宽甸镇、长甸区和牛毛坞区等地农民，纷纷赶来向该分团详述美帝国主义撒布细菌的经过。
    长甸区四平街村农民于成林向调查团详述他亲眼看到美机撒布细菌毒虫的情形。三月十六日午后二时半，三架美国飞机自高空掠过时，他看到飞机投下黑色物体一个。这黑色物体逐渐下降，愈到下面体积愈小，随即落在附近小山的背面。当时他会同李玉发等农民八名和小学生四名，跟踪追去，到黑色物体降落的地点时，即发现密聚成团的苍蝇哄然飞起。这些苍蝇是当地以前没有见过的。该村另一农民刘景和向该分团叙述了他发现美国飞机丢下的一种银白色的里外五层布和纸皮相间精制的包装物的经过。这个容器的残破部分是他在三月十六日十二时二十分目睹自美机投下的一种物体，他要求该分团作为控诉美帝国主义进行细菌战的证据。与会的各地农民一致说：宽甸县许多地方于三月初同时发现的大量苍蝇、蚊子、蜘蛛等毒虫，我们从来没有见过。除了这些虫的形状和本地的虫大不相同外，这些虫出现的时间，也较本地的昆虫早了两三个月。宽甸镇南门外五十一岁的居民刘童伦说：
    “美国飞机撒下的蚂蚁，比当地的蚂蚁大。当地的蚂蚁每年最早在六月才能从窠里爬出来。现在地面还冻着，盖着雪，当地的蚂蚁怎能爬到雪上来？这显然是美国空中强盗撒下来毒害人民的。”宽甸镇南门外六十二岁的老农邹子恒说：“我活了这么大年纪，从来没有见过在阴历二月的大雪天里就有这么多的苍蝇、蚊子。常年这里总要过清明节以后才能见到苍蝇、蚊子。现在所发现的这种形状的苍蝇、蚊子，我从幼时到现在也没见着过。”
    调查会结束时，东北分团团长陈其瑗曾作简短讲话。
