    Female Volunteer Soldiers Active on the Korean Battlefield
    Xiang Ming
    In the leadership organs and logistics departments of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, there are more than fifty female staff members. They are all young people, and most of them are outstanding Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Some of them were ordinary middle school students or simple rural women not long before they entered North Korea. But through heroic and arduous struggles, they have gradually grown into strong female soldiers.
    During the thousand-mile march from the Yalu River to the Imjin River, many female comrades suffered from menstrual problems, and many had blisters on their feet. On dark nights, walking on muddy, rugged roads, sometimes even falling into deep ditches and breaking their heads and bleeding, they got up, endured the pain, and caught up with the team. They always remembered their oath before going abroad and the suffering of the Korean people. Most of them carried twenty to thirty pounds of things on their backs and walked eighty, ninety, or even a hundred li every day, without anyone complaining. After walking the road at night, they still had to work as usual during the day.
    The female nurses in the logistics hospital, whenever they arrived at the campsite, no matter how tired they were, would first dig air-raid shelters for the wounded and sick soldiers and settle them properly, and then dig their own. The field hospitals were scattered, often located in several mountain gullies or mountains. They ran back and forth all day long, giving injections and changing dressings for the wounded and sick soldiers. In winter, they often had to go several miles away to carry firewood to heat the kangs for the wounded and sick soldiers. Zhao Yueqin, a twenty-two-year-old female Communist Youth League member, took care of thirty-two seriously ill patients in six wards by herself last autumn. Just for meals, there were four types, and each person was fed by her alone each time. Every day, she also carried the patients living in the air-raid shelters out to bask in the sun twice. She once washed one hundred and forty pieces of clothing and quilts for the patients in a week. When it rained, she covered the patients with raincloth, while she was soaked in the rain. Geng Sumo, a twenty-five-year-old Communist Youth League member and third-class meritorious person, is the editor of the logistics newspaper of the unit. For a period of time, she was solely responsible for all the editing, communication, typesetting, and proofreading of the newspaper, and published eleven issues successively. Female comrades working in the confidential departments have also shown remarkable achievements. During combat, they often worked day and night. Three or four of them squeezed into a small air-raid shelter, unable to straighten their waists. Sometimes they would lay a raincloth under the flowing water stone and work with their leather bags on their laps. When it rained, they were soaked, but they used various methods to protect the codes from damage. The tense combat environment and difficult working conditions did not affect the improvement of their professional skills. Kong Deying, an eighteen-year-old Communist Youth League member, could only translate more than three hundred words per hour when she first started working. By the end of last year, she could translate more than one thousand five hundred and thirty words per hour. The female members of the cultural troupe often went to places very close to the front line to perform through the enemy's fire blockade. The front-line troops lived very scattered, and sometimes they had to walk dozens of miles a day to perform for two units. Once, two female members arrived at a place only five li away from the front line to perform for the soldiers, and there was no place to hide around. Enemy planes flew back and forth overhead, and the soldiers held branches as camouflage. They calmly danced the famous Korean dance "Yangsan Road". The soldiers said: "The female comrades are risking such a big danger to perform for us, we must fight well!"

    活跃在朝鲜战场上的志愿军女战士
    向明
    在人民志愿军某部的各级领导机关和后勤部门里，有五十多个女工作人员。她们都是青年，大部分是优秀的共产党员和青年团员。有些人在入朝以前不久，还是普通中学的学生或纯朴的农村妇女。但经过英勇艰苦的斗争，已逐渐成长为坚强的女战士。
    从鸭绿江到临津江的千里进军途中，许多女同志都患着月经病，许多人的脚上打起了血泡。漆黑的夜晚，走在泥泞、崎岖的道路上，有时即使跌到深沟里，碰得头破血流，但她们爬起来，忍着疼痛，又赶上了队伍。她们时刻记着自己出国前的誓言和朝鲜人民的苦难。她们大多数人背上背了二、三十斤重的东西，每天走八十、九十里以至一百里路，没有一个人叫苦。晚上走了路，白天还要照样工作。
    后勤医院的女护士们，每到宿营地，无论多累，都要先给伤病员挖防空洞，把他们安置妥当，然后再挖自己的。战地医院住得很分散，常常是住在几个山沟里或山上。她们整天不停地跑来跑去，给伤病员打针、换药。冬天，还要时常到数里以外背柴，给伤病员烧炕。二十二岁的女青年团员赵月琴，去年秋天一个人看护过六个病房的三十二个重病号。光是吃饭，就分为四种，每人每次吃饭，都由她一个人喂。每天还要把住在防空洞的病人背出来晒两次太阳。她曾在一个星期里给病人洗过一百四十件衣服和被子。下雨的时候，她把雨布给病人盖上，而自己却淋着雨。二十五岁的青年团员三等功臣耿素墨，是该部后勤报的编辑。有一个时期，她一个人担任了报纸的全部编辑、通讯、排版、校对工作，先后出版了十一期。在机要部门工作的女同志，也表现出卓著的成绩。在作战期间，她们常常昼夜不停地工作。她们三四个人挤在一个小小的防空洞里，腰也直不起来。有时候就在流着水的石岩下铺块雨布，把皮包搁在腿上工作。下雨的时候，自己淋得透湿，却用各种方法保护电码，使它不受损坏。紧张的战斗环境，困难的工作条件，都未能影响业务上的提高。十八岁的青年团员孔德英，刚参加工作时，译电每小时只能译三百多字。到去年年底，每小时已能译到一千五百三十多字了。文工团的女团员们，经常通过敌人的炮火封锁线，到离火线很近的地方演出。前线部队住的很分散，她们有时一天要走几十里路给两个单位出演。有一次，两个女团员到达距火线只五里的地方给战士们表演，四周找不到隐蔽的地方。敌机在上空往来飞过，战士们手拿着树枝作伪装，她们沉着地跳着朝鲜名舞“羊山道”。战士们说：“女同志们冒着这么大的危险来为我们演出，我们一定把仗打好！”
