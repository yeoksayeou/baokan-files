Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong Front, 6th: Our frontline reporter reports: On February 26th, at 1:30 PM, the artillery units of the American invading army's Third Division, entrenched in the Gaochengxia Village Xin Village northwest of Lianchuan on the Imjin River front, fired six bacteriological artillery shells at our Zhaoyangdong position, five kilometers northwest of Ma Liang Mountain. The American artillery first released smoke shells, and the six shells carrying bacteriological insects exploded in the smoke. The sound of the bacteriological shells exploding was relatively small. After the explosion, many flies and spiders were immediately found around the shell crater. These flies were all black with small heads, narrow and long wings, and long hairs on their bodies; most of the spiders were fleshy red, a few were black, with round and small bellies and two tender whiskers.

On the same day, from 8:30 PM to 9:00 PM, two American bombers dropped bombs containing bacteriological insects north of Zuoshuidong, more than ten kilometers northwest of Ma Liang Mountain.

The American aggressors' desperate continuation of bacteriological warfare on the battlefield has aroused even greater anger among our frontline fighters. The soldiers guarding the front lines of Ma Liang Mountain said with gnashed teeth: "The American aggressors are using bacteriological weapons to poison us and the Korean people one after another, which is truly despicable and shameless to the extreme. We must severely punish these American beasts in battle!" Gunners of a certain artillery company who repeatedly performed meritorious deeds in the counterattack on Ma Liang Mountain to shatter Van Fleet's Autumn Offensive stated: "It is impossible for the enemy to use bacteriological weapons to save its defeat in Korea. We must be vigilant and overcome all the enemy's conspiracies and tricks!"

    侵朝美军卑鄙发射细菌炮弹
    激起我前线战士更大的愤怒
    【新华社开城前线六日电】本社前线记者报道：二月二十六日下午一时三十分，盘踞临津江前线涟川西北高栈下里新村的美国侵略军第三师的炮兵部队，用榴弹炮向我马良山西北五公里的照阳洞阵地发射了六发细菌炮弹。美军炮兵先放射了烟幕弹，六发带有细菌毒虫的炮弹随着在烟幕中爆炸。该细菌炮弹爆炸的声音较小，爆炸后，在炮弹坑的周围，当即发现很多苍蝇和蜘蛛。这些苍蝇都是黑色，头小，翅膀窄长，身上的绒毛较长；蜘蛛大部分是肉红色，少数是黑色，肚子圆小，有两条嫩须。
    同日晚上八时三十分至九时，美军两架轰炸机在马良山西北十余公里的左水洞北，投掷了带有细菌毒虫的炸弹。
    美国侵略者穷凶极恶地继续在战场上进行细菌战，已激起了我前线战士们对敌人更大的愤怒。守卫在马良山一线阵地上的战士们咬牙切齿地说：“美国侵略者接二连三地用细菌武器来毒害我们和朝鲜人民，真是卑鄙无耻到顶点了。我们一定要在战斗中狠狠地惩罚这些美国野兽！”在粉碎范佛里特秋季攻势的马良山反击战中屡建功勋的某炮兵连炮手们表示：“敌人想用细菌武器来挽救它在朝鲜的失败是不可能的。我们要提高警惕，战胜敌人的一切阴谋诡计！”
