    Editor's Note: This is a paper by N. A. Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, published in Pravda on February 29. The paper vividly illustrates the great scientific achievements of Soviet scientists under the principle of the unity of theory and practice. We are translating this article for the reference of China's cultural, educational and scientific circles.

    The Communist Party and Comrade Stalin regard the creative unity of theory and practice as the most necessary condition for progress. Theory develops on the basis of practice and is closely related to practice. Theory must serve practice, answer the questions raised by practice, be tested by the materials of practice, and illuminate the road of practice's development. The invincible power of advanced Soviet science lies in the unity of theory and practice.

    The new, socialist relationship between labor and science is manifested in the joint creative activities of scientific workers and practical workers.

    The power and achievements of Soviet science are for the well-being of mankind. Just as reactionary American "scientists"—the lackeys of warmongers—are expending all their efforts to manufacture weapons of murder, Soviet scientists are enriching science with new discoveries, the mission of which is to help build a communist society, help develop our national economy, promote culture, and continuously increase the welfare of workers. Soviet scientists, together with the entire Soviet people, are conquering nature: searching for new sources of power and raw materials, changing the climate, drying up swamps, and turning deserts into prosperous gardens.

    In fulfilling the historical task put forward by Comrade Stalin—not only to catch up with but also to surpass foreign scientific achievements—Soviet scientists have taken the first place in the development of world science in many fields of knowledge.

    I

    Three years ago, the people of Leningrad initiated a patriotic movement of creative contact between scientific workers and production workers. Their initiative received enthusiastic support from all Soviet scientific workers and the most enthusiastic response from workers, engineers, and technicians.

    The task of creative cooperation is to accelerate the creation of new and improved machines, instruments, and appliances, to implement the suggestions of scientists, engineers, and Stakhanovite workers—production innovators—and to increase labor productivity. Creative cooperation can smoothly adopt advanced technologies, mechanize arduous labor processes, and strengthen efforts to improve product quality standards.

    The joint work of scientific institutions with enterprises, collective farms, and Soviet farms is carried out according to cooperation contracts or well-coordinated plans, which is the most important form of contact between science and production.

    The plan of scientific work is of great significance for consolidating the cooperation between science and production. This plan must promptly and correctly estimate the requirements put forward by the development of the domestic national economy and culture. This is necessary to ensure the development of our motherland's productive forces with scientific achievements. This is also necessary for science itself, because science obtains its tasks from practice, develops under the influence of practice, and tests its achievements with practice. Many examples of Soviet science are vivid confirmations of this.

    The emergence of the new science—agrobiology—is most closely linked to socialist practice. Undoubtedly, without the construction of collective farms, the agrobiology of Michurin could not have been produced and developed. The construction of vast shelterbelts has enriched our forestry, and the unprecedented scale of irrigation construction has promoted the further development of soil improvement, soil science, and other scientific fields. The huge work of the great construction projects has put forward new tasks for mechanics, and the successful solution of these tasks has affected the practice of construction, which can save many millions of rubles. The construction of huge hydropower stations has made hydraulic technology and electrical technology fruitful, and has put forward the task of further developing these scientific fields.

    The progress of our country's industrialization has made new technical subjects such as automation and remote control a reality. They fundamentally lighten human labor and play a huge role in accelerating the speed of economic construction.

    Enriching science with the practice of building a communist society is the most important condition for the growth and prosperity of our science. Scientific and its workers (from junior scientific staff to academicians), scientific organizations (from the smallest scientific groups to the Soviet Academy of Sciences), should be closely linked to practice, to production, and should understand and love them, because only in this case will their efforts be fruitful. The reason for the bankruptcy of "theories" such as Weismann-Morganism in biology, "resonance theory" in chemistry, and Marr's so-called "new theory of language," in addition to other reasons, is that they are ineffective in practice and therefore in science, and that they are divorced from life.

    The plan for developing science implemented in our country helps guide the actions of Soviet scientists to solve the most urgent and fundamental problems in various fields of knowledge that are of great significance to the practice of communist construction. The great significance of the plan for guiding the scientific research work of our scientific institutions lies here.

    II

    Comrade Stalin pointed out that in a communist society, the planned national economy, whether in industry or agriculture, will be based on superb technology.

    All scientific departments play a huge role in solving the tasks of our country's future technological progress. The higher the technology, the greater the need to apply science to production, and the wider the scope of cooperation between scientific workers and practical workers.

    Science penetrates deeper and deeper into all the pores of production practice day by day, and has a greater impact on the development of the national economy.

    Physics creates new principles for the development of technology, arms science and technology with new research methods, and opens the way to the manufacture of more perfect new machines, instruments, and appliances, which are necessary for future technological progress and for delving into the mysteries of nature. Electronics and radio engineering are increasingly widely penetrating into various departments of production.

    The use of atomic internal energy will play an important role in creating the material and technical basis of a communist society. The discovery by Soviet scientists of methods for using atomic internal energy is a fact of great theoretical and practical significance. At the same time, it represents the results of the cooperation of the most extensive and fruitful scientific workers and production workers.

    The high degree of chemicalization of the modern oil refining industry, and the guiding of oil refining with complex chemical and technical methods, is only possible due to the following achievements of our country's chemistry: the theory of catalysis, the study of organic contact reactions and catalysts, the study of the properties and reactions of hydrocarbons, and the development of new analytical methods and new instruments for studying oil and petroleum products.

    The credit for using simple catalysis to convert certain kinds of hydrocarbons into other kinds, making hydrocarbon raw materials into valuable hydrocarbon products, belongs to Soviet chemists, first of all Academician Zelinsky and his school. These works became possible because of constant contact with the petroleum industry and estimation of its requirements and needs.

    Organic chemists have found methods to obtain new therapeutic agents and other compounds that are close to natural compounds in their physiological effects. They use the rich plant resources of our country, decompose new plant bases, antibacterial agents, and other natural medicines. Microbiologists and chemists have studied the artificial manufacturing method of vitamins, and the method of obtaining and refining important antibacterial agents such as penicillin and streptomycin in factories. Chemists have created new anesthetics that are five times more effective than morphine without toxic consequences. The rapid creation and application of this new drug in medical practice within one year was only possible due to the close cooperation between the Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Scientific Research Institute of Chemical Pharmaceuticals of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and hospitals.

    The creative cooperation between scientific workers and production workers facilitates the application of the results of scientific research to the national economy, and promotes the rapid transmission of scientific harvests to production. This is not only an effective help to production, but also the best way to test the correctness of scientific working methods aimed at developing science. Science's help in solving the current needs and tasks of production is a matter of great significance that can save a lot of time and a lot of resources for the national economy.

    However, a more important thing is that close cooperation with production can foresee the great tasks of science and technology for tomorrow, and bravely solve these tasks. Science can best develop when it is closely linked to life and to solving important practical tasks.

    Take Academician Vavilov's research on luminescence as an example. The results of these studies have been widely applied to the national economy. For example, luminescence analysis has been widely recognized. In oil prospecting work, the use of this analytical method only requires a simple observation of the rock for a few minutes, which can replace the laborious chemical analysis that lasts for several weeks. Luminescence microscopes and ultraviolet microscopes have created the possibility of scientific research that was previously unimaginable in histology, cytology, medicine, and chemistry. Luminescence flaw detectors have a huge role, and they can find even the smallest cracks in metal parts. Luminescent lamps are two-thirds more economical than ordinary electric lights, and can obtain light that is exactly the same as sunlight in terms of composition. Widely using them to replace incandescent lamps is equivalent to building several of the most powerful hydropower stations. These are just a few examples of the application of luminescence.

    There is no doubt that if many aspects of science and practice should be attributed to Vavilov and his school, then the theory of luminescence itself has achieved such brilliant development only because it has been applied in a variety of ways, and such applications are because it has aroused the necessity of extensive experiments in all aspects.

    Due to the work of Soviet scientists and engineers in strengthening metallurgical processes, in building metallurgical furnaces with huge productivity, and in manufacturing new types of high-quality metals, Soviet metallurgy has advanced far in the post-war years.

    The work of strengthening the metallurgical process of steelmaking was done in close cooperation between scientists and production workers, which discovered new possibilities for improving labor productivity, tapped new potential for expanding product output, and opened up new avenues for improving product quality.

    In the cooperation contract, it is stipulated that the scientific institutions of the Soviet Academy of Sciences conduct joint work with the research institutes or industrial enterprises of various ministries. As a rule, the basis of the contract is a scientific problem that is directly concerned with a certain production department. In this case, the Academy of Sciences is usually responsible for creative research, formulating major plans, calculation methods, technological principles, etc. The ministry's research institute or production organization provides scientists with the necessary materials, conducts experimental checks on the results of research, prepares experimental equipment, and participates in industrial testing with scientists.

    The joint work of the Institute of Machinery of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Central Gas-Hydrodynamics Research Institute, and the Leningrad Stalin Metallurgical Factory in creating methods and instruments for measuring the realistic conditions of pressure, deformation, and vibration in various parts of hydraulic turbines is an example of this cooperation. The Institute of Machinery formulated the main plan for this instrument in this regard, and manufactured these instruments together with the Central Gas-Hydrodynamics Research Institute. The Leningrad Metallurgical Factory installed experimental equipment for conducting experiments on these instruments. Finally, all the above organizations will participate in the joint experiment.

    III

    The mechanization of industrial production and agricultural production is being carried out on a scale that is unprecedented in the world. The Soviet Union is the country with the highest degree of mechanization of heavy labor and arduous labor.

    The work of fully mechanizing mining work is being carried out on a large scale: the manufacture of new-style machines with high productivity, the electrification of underground transportation, and the automation of lifting from mine shafts. The mechanization of earthwork has advanced far, which is of special significance for the great communist construction projects. The full mechanization of oil extraction is being realized, and so on.

    Our national economy is equipped with the best Soviet technology in the world, the technology of a communist society. Perfect new machines and machinery, while minimizing the labor of workers and requiring workers to have a high degree of productive skills, are minimizing the difference between intellectual labor and physical labor as much as possible. Science and new technology are raising the cultural and technical level of workers, making their labor close to the labor of engineering and technical personnel.

    The work of automating production is being carried out as much as possible in the Soviet Union. Automation is used particularly widely in the work of power plants and power grids, and hydropower stations are being converted to full automation. The automatic control of technical procedures from a distance is being adopted more and more widely.

    Workers in the Soviet machine manufacturing industry have manufactured many new machines that meet the requirements of modern advanced technology and are based on high-speed, full mechanization, and automation of the production process.

    A group of Soviet engineers formulated the principles of full automation of the production process in the machine manufacturing industry, and established an automatic factory for manufacturing pistons. This outstanding invention should be specially pointed out. This factory is a unified system of automatic machine actions, which realizes the entire production process of pistons.

    All these outstanding inventions and fundamental improvements are the result of the joint creative labor of scientists and production innovators.

    Soviet scientists are giving great help to the great communist construction projects. A committee to assist in the construction of hydropower stations, canals, and irrigation systems has been established under the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, which coordinates the activities of scientists to solve the most important tasks in the great construction projects, and guides their activities. Committees to assist in the great communist construction projects have also been established under the academies of sciences of various republics.

    In order to strive to establish close cooperation with construction personnel and to clarify the most important scientific problems that need to be solved first, the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences sent a scientific working team to the communist construction site at the end of last year. Large experts in various fields of knowledge participated in these teams. Important tasks were put forward to these teams—to ensure that the construction personnel are given the most skilled answers to the various problems in carrying out the construction work, so as to help them further improve the speed of construction.

    The work of scientists who departed to the construction sites of the Volga-Don Canal, the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, the Stalingrad Hydropower Station, the Kakhovka Hydropower Station, and the South Ukraine Canal proved the further enhancement of the creative cooperation between scientists and engineering and technical personnel and workers in the great communist construction projects.

    The Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences decided to preserve these working teams as permanent organizations. They will maintain the living contact between the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the academies of sciences of various republics and the great communist construction projects.

    Summarizing the advanced experience of production innovators, the experience of Stakhanovite workers, is an important task of scientific institutions. This does not mean simply recording the experience and passing it on to other enterprises, but scientifically evaluating this experience, clarifying its new and promising characteristics, and determining the road of development.

    Comrade Stalin said at the First All-Soviet Conference of Stakhanovite Workers in 1935: "Isn't it obvious? Stakhanovite workers are the innovators in our industry, the Stakhanovite movement is the future of our industry, it contains the seeds of the future cultural and technical upsurge of the working class, it opens up a road for us, the high labor productivity mark necessary for the transition from socialist society to communist society, only from this road can we achieve..."

    The artisans of socialist industry and agriculture are now working more and more closely with science and technology workers, looking for new possibilities to increase labor productivity, reduce product costs, save raw materials, fuel, and electricity, and increase yields. The party and state organs, the Soviet press, and the mass social organizations of workers strive to support the initiatives of production innovators and help promote Stakhanovite experience.

    Thousands of production innovators are striving to fight for better use of equipment and tools. The movement for fast working methods launched in all aspects of the national economy is the best proof.

    The initiative of fast lathe workers is a sign of this; their method is based on the rational use of tools, the use of new angles of cutting tools, the full use of the capacity of equipment, and the rational establishment of metal processing technology.

    Thanks to the scientific summary of Stakhanovite working methods and the widespread popularization of them, the productivity of equipment in our factories is growing many times over.

    Stakhanovite labor, such as watching over multiple machines, being proficient in several skills, striving to save raw materials, and reducing costs in each production operation, plays an important role in achieving high technical and economic indicators in enterprise work.

    The words of our great scientist Timiryazev have been fulfilled, he said: "Only science and democracy, knowledge and labor, inspired by the common red flag and the sign of world peace, can conquer everything and transform everything for the happiness of all mankind when they enter into a free, based on mutual understanding, close alliance."

    Socialism has brought into play the creativity and talent of millions of people. Studying the experience of production innovators carefully, and promoting and developing this experience, is a matter of great national importance.

    However, there is no doubt that the scale and depth of the work of summarizing the experiences of production innovators, and the support of the scientific community for their initiatives, are completely inadequate. The task of the Academy of Sciences, first of all the technical science department, and the tasks of the various academies and branches, lie in striving to expand and deepen the work of scientifically summarizing the experiences of production innovators.

    IV

    The examples given do not exhaust the full diversity of cooperation between science and production. There is no doubt that the cooperation between science and production has achieved great achievements in the development of science and in the application of the results of scientific research in the national economy. However, these achievements can increase if scientific workers and production workers pay more attention to the issue of creative cooperation.

    The direction of cooperation between some scientific institutions and production has not been sufficiently focused on solving huge scientific problems with joint efforts, and these problems are of great significance for the fastest way to improve national productivity, for transitioning to a higher stage of technological progress, and for building the material and technical foundations of a communist society. What should become the center of attention of scientific institutions is not to help industrial enterprises solve local daily problems in production, but to apply new and advanced working methods determined by the achievements of science and technology to practice.

    Summarizing the advanced experience of industry and agriculture should become the most important task of joint work between scientists and production workers, and the research work cannot be developed smoothly without solving this task. Until recently, this work was carried out intermittently, and it was far from being carried out by all scientific institutions. It is necessary to put the summary of advanced experience into the work system of each scientific institution, hold joint meetings, hold well-prepared representative meetings with reports from scientists and practical workers, and publish joint works summarizing advanced experience—this should become our daily way of working. As a result of such exchanges between scientific workers and production workers, problems that science has not yet solved will inevitably arise. These problems will need to be studied by scientific organizations.

    The coordination of the work of the scientific institutions of the Academy of Sciences and the research institutes of various ministries is of extraordinary significance in this regard. It is extremely necessary to make the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the academies of sciences of various republics, specialized colleges, and related ministries seriously pay attention to this.

    The joint work carried out by scientific institutions and production enterprises according to cooperation contracts is the link in the entire chain, and it is necessary to grasp it in order to practically expand the front line of scientific and production contacts. The leaders of scientific institutions and enterprises must study the experience of joint work, and must organize and guide these joint work in the future so that the problems that are solved are not small local tasks, but problems with great prospects. In such a situation, the effect of creative cooperation will greatly increase. Attention to joint scientific work should be greatly strengthened not only from the Academy of Sciences and universities, but also from various ministries.

    Creative cooperation is the basic content of socialist competition under the working conditions of scientific institutions. To solve the urgent scientific problems in the development of the national economy most quickly, and to apply them to practice, these tasks should be regarded as the basis of the socialist competition convention for individual scientific workers and the entire scientific institution. This can only be accomplished under the conditions of creative cooperation between scientists and production workers. It is necessary to organize things in such a way that the competition is two-sided, even if scientific organizations and production organizations participate in the competition to the same extent. This kind of socialist competition has been rarely noticed now.

    Creative cooperation between scientific workers and production workers is a social patriotic movement, its realization is caused by the desire of the Soviet people to speed up the development of all aspects of Soviet science, technology, economy, and culture. This movement of millions of people is prepared by the achievements of communist construction, by our way of life, in which every scientific and production worker is an active builder of communist society. Such cooperation is inextricably linked to the socialist system and arises from the basis of our country and social structure.

    Since creative cooperation is a social movement, the organizational role of the party, trade unions, and social organizations in this movement is huge. The task of these organizations lies in carrying out daily educational work among scientific cadres, arming them with Marxist-Leninist theory, and guiding scientific workers to strive to complete the most important tasks of economic and cultural construction.

    Party organizations must help scientific institutions consolidate their ties with practice, strive to help improve the level of scientific work, and educate scientific workers with a high spirit of ideology and principle in science, and with the spirit of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism. We must adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism more extensively and fully in various fields of knowledge. We must use the full power of this method to develop Soviet science.

    Soviet scientists regard strengthening the power of our motherland as their sacred duty. They will spare no effort to complete the tasks put forward by the Communist Party and Comrade Stalin to Soviet science. They will work with a more persevering and unyielding spirit in cooperation with industrial and agricultural workers in 1952 to develop advanced Soviet science.

    We cannot be complacent with the achievements we have already made. Scientific and productive creative cooperation has taken its first steps. A huge job of attracting more and more scientific workers and production workers to this movement lies ahead. Inspired by the great ideas of Lenin and Stalin, Soviet scientists are dedicating all their strength and knowledge to the cause of building a communist society. (Li He translated)

    在创造上合作的伟大力量
    苏联科学院院长  涅斯米扬诺夫
    编者按：这是真理报二月二十九日发表的苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫的论文。论文生动地说明了苏联科学工作者在理论和实践统一的原则下所获得的科学上的伟大成就。现特将此文译出，供我国文教科学界研究参考。
    共产党、斯大林同志把理论和实践的创造性的统一看作进步的最必要条件。理论在实践的基础上发展，和实践密切地联系。理论必须为实践服务，回答实践所提出的问题，以实践的材料来检验，照亮实践发展的道路。苏联先进科学的不可战胜的力量，就在于理论和实践的统一。
    在科学工作人员和实际工作人员的共同创造活动中，表现着劳动和科学之间新的、社会主义的相互关系。
    苏联科学的力量和成就，是为人类谋幸福的。正当反动的美国“科学家”——战争挑拨者的奴才，耗费所有力量去制造杀人武器的时候，苏联科学家以新的发现使科学丰富起来，这些发现的使命是帮助共产主义社会的建设，帮助我们国民经济的发展、文化的繁荣和劳动者福利的不断增长。苏联科学家和全体苏联人民一起征服着自然：寻找着新的动力和原料的泉源，改变着气候，弄干沼地，变荒漠为繁荣的花园。
    在完成斯大林同志所提出的历史任务——不但要赶上而且要超过国外科学成就——的时候，在许多知识部门中，苏联科学家在发展世界科学中占了第一位。
    一
    三年前，列宁格勒人创始了科学工作人员和生产工作人员在创造上联系的爱国运动。他们的创举受到了苏联所有科学工作人员的热烈支持，在工人、工程师和技师中得到了最热烈的响应。
    在创造上合作的任务，是加快地创造新的、完善的机器、仪器和器具，实现科学家、工程师和斯塔哈诺夫式的工人——生产革新者们的建议，提高劳动生产率。在创造上合作，能够顺利地采用先进技术，使吃力的劳动过程机械化，加强改进生产质量标志的努力。
    科学机关跟企业，跟集体农场，跟苏维埃农场的共同工作，根据合作的合同或者按照很好地配合的计划进行，这是科学跟生产联系的最重要形式。
    科学工作的计划，对于巩固科学和生产的合作有巨大意义。这种计划必须及时和正确地估计到由发展国内国民经济和文化所提出的要求。这对于以科学成就来保证我们祖国生产力的发展，是必要的。这对于科学本身也是必要的，因为科学从实践中获得自己的任务，在实践的影响之下发展，并且用实践来检验自己的成果。苏联科学的很多例子便是鲜明的确证。
    新的科学——农艺生物学的产生，和社会主义实践最密切地联系着。无疑的，没有集体农场建设，就不能产生和发展米丘林的农艺生物学。庞大的防护林带的营造，使我们的森林学丰富起来，而空前规模的灌溉建设，促使土壤改良学、土壤学及其他科学部门获得进一步发展。伟大建设工程的庞大工作，向机械学提出新的任务，而这些任务的顺利解决，影响于建设的实践，可以节省许多百万卢布。巨大的水电站的建设，使水力技术和电力技术富有成效，向它们提出进一步发展这些科学部门的任务。
    我国工业化的进步，使自动化和远距离操纵这类新的技术科目成为现实，它们根本地减轻人的劳动，并且在加快经济建设的速度上起着巨大作用。
    以建设共产主义社会的实践来丰富科学，是我们科学成长和繁荣的最重要条件。科学及其工作者（从初级科学工作人员到院士），科学组织（从最小的科学小组到苏联科学院），都应当跟实践，跟生产密切地联系起来，通晓它们和喜爱它们，因为只有在这样的情形下，他们的努力才会富有成效。像生物学中的魏斯曼主义——摩尔根主义，像化学中的“反响论”，像马尔的所谓“语言新学说”，这类“理论”破产的原因，除了别的原因以外，就在于它们在实践上从而在科学上是毫无成效的，在于它们脱离了生活。
    在我国实行的发展科学的计划，有助于指引苏联科学家的行动去解决对于共产主义建设的实践有重要意义的各门知识中最迫切、最根本的问题。指导我们科学机关的科学研究工作计划的巨大意义，就在这里。
    二
    斯大林同志指出，在共产主义社会里，按照计划组织起来的国民经济，不论在工业方面，不论在农业方面，都将基于高超的技术。
    所有科学部门在解决我国今后技术进步的任务上都有巨大作用。技术愈高，把科学应用到生产去的必要就愈大，科学工作人员和实际工作人员合作的范围就愈广。
    科学一天天更深入地钻进生产实践的所有孔道中去，更大地影响着国民经济的发展。
    物理学创造发展技术的新原则，以新的研究方法武装科学和技术，开辟制造更完善的新机器、仪器、器具的道路，这些机器、仪器、器具是今后技术进步和深入自然界奥秘中去所必需的。电子学和无线电工学日益广泛地深入到生产各部门中去。
    原子内部能力的使用，在创造共产主义社会的物质和技术基础上，将起重要的作用。苏联科学家之发现使用原子内部能力的方法，是有巨大的理论和实际意义的事实。同时，它表示了规模最广、富有成效的科学工作人员和生产工作人员的合作成果。
    现代石油提炼工业的高度化学化，和以复杂的化学和技术方法指挥炼油，也是只有由于我们祖国化学的如下成就才成为可能的：触媒作用论，有机的接触反应和触媒的研究，碳化氢的特性和反应的研究，研究石油和石油产品的新分析法和新器具的制订。
    用简单的触媒作用把某些种碳化氢转变为另些种，使得碳化氢原料转变为有实际价值的碳化氢产品，这功劳属于苏联化学家，首先是捷林斯基院士及其学派。这些工作之成为可能，是由于跟石油工业经常接触，并且估计到了它的要求和需要的缘故。
    有机化学家寻找出了取得新的治疗剂及其他化合物的方法，这些化合物按其生理功效是接近于自然界化合物的。他们利用我们祖国自然界丰富的植物资源，分解出新的植物盐基、抗菌药剂及其他自然界的药物。微生物学家和化学家研究出维他命的人工制造法，在工厂取得和精炼像盘尼西林和链霉素这类重要的抗菌药剂的方法。化学家们创造了新的麻药，功效五倍于吗啡而没有毒害的后果。在一年之间迅速地创造并且在医疗的实践中应用了这个新药剂，其成为可能只有由于苏联科学院的有机化学研究院、化学工业部的化学药剂科学研究院和医院密切合作的结果。
    科学工作人员和生产工作人员在创造上合作，便利于把科学研究的成果应用到国民经济中去，促使科学收获迅速地传给生产。这不但是对生产的有效帮助，而且是检验以发展科学为目标的科学工作方法的正确性的最好方式。科学帮助解决生产的当前需要和任务，是能够为国民经济节约大量时间和大量资力的有重大意义的事情。
    然而更加重要的事情是由于跟生产的密切合作而能预见明天科学和技术的伟大任务，并且勇敢地解决这些任务。科学，当它跟生活，跟解决重要的实践任务密切联系的时候，才能够最好地发展。
    以瓦维洛夫院士在发光方面的研究为例。这些研究的结果已被广泛地应用到国民经济中去。例如，发光的分析，受到了公认。在石油的采测工作中，这种分析方法的使用，只须几分钟的岩石简单察看，就可代替延长几星期的费力的化学分析。发光显微镜和紫外线显微镜创造了在组织学、细胞学，在医学和化学中以前梦想不到的科学研究的可能性。发光显缺镜有巨大作用，它可能在金属零件中发现甚至最细小的裂缝。发光灯比通常电灯经济三分之二的费用，并且可得到按成分和太阳光完全相同的光线。广泛地运用它们来代替白热电灯，等于建设几个最强大的水电站。这只是运用发光方面的几个例子。
    毫无疑义，如果科学和实践的各个方面有很多都应当归功于瓦维洛夫及其学派，那么发光论本身之所以获得这样辉煌的发展，只是由于它被多样地应用的结果，而这样的应用是因为它引起了各方面广泛地实验的必要。
    由于苏联科学家和工程师在强化冶金过程，在建筑有巨大生产率的冶金炉，以及在制造新品类的优等金属方面的工作，苏联冶金术在战后年份中前进得很远了。
    强化炼钢的冶金过程的工作，是由科学家和生产工作人员密切合作中做到的，它发现了提高劳动生产率的新可能，发掘了扩大产品出产量的新潜力，开辟了提高产品质量的新道路。
    在合作的合同中，规定苏联科学院的科学机关跟各部的研究院或工业企业进行共同的工作。照例，作为合同基础的是解决一定生产部门所直接关心的某个科学问题。在这种场合，科学院机关通常负责创造上的研究，制定主要方案、计算方法、工艺原则等等，部的研究院或生产组织向科学家提供必要的材料，对于研究的结果进行试验性检查，准备试验的设备，并且和科学家一起参加工业的检验。
    苏联科学院的机器学研究院、中央气体水力力学研究院和列宁格勒斯大林冶金工厂，在创造对水力涡轮机各部分中压力、变形和振动的现实条件的测量方法和器具方面的共同工作，就是这种合作的例子。机器学研究院在这方面制定这种器具的主要方案，并且跟中央气体水力力学研究院一起制造这些仪器。列宁格勒冶金工厂为进行这些器具的试验，装置试验设备。最后，所有上述组织都将参加共同的试验。
    三
    工业生产和农业生产的机械化，世界上没有像我们国家这样巨大规模的。苏联是重劳动和吃力劳动机械化程度最高的国家。
    采矿工作大规模地进行着全盘机械化的工作：生产率高的新式机器的制造，地下运输的电气化，从矿井直窿升运的自动化。土工的机械化前进得远了，它对于伟大的共产主义建设工程有特别意义。石油开采的全盘机械化正在实现，等等。
    我们的国民经济装备着世界上最好的苏联技术、共产主义社会的技术。完善的新机器和机械，尽量减轻工人的劳动并且要求工人有高度生产技艺，尽量帮助克服智力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别。科学和新式技术提高着工人的文化技术水平，使他们的劳动接近于工程技术工作人员的劳动。
    在苏联尽力展开着生产自动化的工作。在发电站和发电网的工作中特别广泛地运用自动化，水电站转到完全自动化。技术手续的远距离自动管制，日益广泛地采用着。
    苏联机器制造业工作者制造了许多新颖机器，它们是符合于现代先进技术的要求，基于生产过程的高速、全盘机械化和自动化的。
    一批苏联工程师制定了机器制造业中生产过程全盘自动化的原则，并且建立造活塞的自动工厂，这个出色的发明是应该特别指出的。这个工厂是机器自动动作的统一体系，它实现着活塞整个生产过程。
    所有这些出色的发明和根本的改进，都是科学家和生产革新者共同的创造性劳动的结果。
    苏联科学家给伟大的共产主义建设工程以重大的帮助。在苏联科学院主席团底下建立了协助建筑水电站、运河和灌溉系统的委员会，它使科学家的解决伟大建设工程中最重要的任务的活动相配合，并且指导他们的活动。在各加盟共和国的科学院底下也建立了协助伟大的共产主义建设工程的委员会。
    苏联科学院主席团为了力求建立跟建筑人员的密切合作，弄明首先要解决的最重要的科学问题，在去年末派了科学工作队到共产主义建筑场所去。参加这些队的有各门知识的大专家。向这些队提出了重要任务——对于进行建筑工作中的各种各样问题，保证给建筑人员作最熟练的解答，从而帮助他们更加提高建设的速度。
    出发到伏尔加河—顿河运河、古比雪夫水电站、斯大林格勒水电站、卡霍夫卡水电站和南乌克兰运河建筑场所去的科学家的工作，证明科学家跟伟大的共产主义建设工程的工程技术工作人员和工人在创造上合作的进一步增强。
    苏联科学院主席团决定了保存这些工作队为经常组织。它们将保持苏联科学院和各加盟共和国科学院跟伟大的共产主义建设工程的活的联系。
    总结生产革新者的先进经验，斯塔哈诺夫式工作者的经验，是科学机关的重要任务。这不是指简单地记录经验和传给其他企业，而是科学地评价这个经验，弄明其新的有前途的特点，并且确定发展的道路。
    斯大林同志一九三五年在第一次全苏联斯塔哈诺夫式工作者会议上说过：“难道不明显吗？斯塔哈诺夫式工作者是我们工业里的革新家，斯塔哈诺夫运动是我们工业的未来，它包含着工人阶级未来文化和技术高涨的种子，它为我们开辟了这样的道路，从社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会所必需的高度劳动生产率标志，只有从这条道路才能达到……”
    社会主义工农业的匠人们跟科学和技术的工作者现在越来越多的密切合作，寻找着提高劳动生产率，减低产品成本，节约原料、燃料、电力，提高收获量的新的可能性。党和国家机关、苏联报刊、劳动者的群众社会团体尽力支持生产革新者的创议，帮助推广斯塔哈诺夫式经验。
    万千生产革新者都努力地为争取更好地使用设备和工具而奋斗。在国民经济各方面展开的争取快速工作法的运动，就是最好的证明。
    快速镟工的创举是这方面的标志；他们的方法是基于合理地使用工具，采用新角度的削截器，充分使用设备的能力，合理地建立金属加工技术。
    由于科学地总结斯塔哈诺夫式工作方法，并且广泛地普及它们，我们工厂的设备生产率增长着许多倍。
    像看管多床机器、兼会几门技艺、争取节约原料、在每个生产操作上减低成本之类的斯塔哈诺夫式劳动，在争取企业工作的技术和经济的高度标志的成就上，起着重要作用。
    我们的伟大科学家季米里雅节夫的一句话应验了，他说：“只有受共同的红旗和全世界和平的标志感召的科学和民主，知识和劳动，进入到自由的、基于互相了解的、密切的联盟的时候，才能为全人类的幸福而征服一切，改造一切。”
    社会主义发挥了千百万人的创造力和才能。仔细地研究生产革新者的经验，推广和发展这个经验，这是有巨大全国重要性的事情。
    然而，无疑的，总结生产革新者们的经验的工作之规模和深度，以及科学界对他们的创举的支持，完全是不够的。科学院，首先是技术科学部分，以及各院各分院的任务，在于尽力地扩大和加深科学地总结生产革新者的经验的工作。

    所举的例子，没有说尽科学和生产合作的全部多样性。无疑的，科学和生产的合作，使科学的发展和在国民经济中采用科学研究的成果取得了巨大成就。然而，在科学工作者和生产工作者更多地注意在创造上合作的问题的条件下，这些成就可能增多起来。
    有些科学机关跟生产的合作的方向，还没有足够地放在以共同努力来解决巨大的科学问题上，而这些问题对于最快地提高国家生产力，对于过渡到技术进步的更高阶段，和对于建设共产主义社会的物质和技术基础，是有重要意义的。应当成为科学机关注意中心的，不是帮助工业企业解决生产上局部的日常问题，而是把由科学和技术的成就所规定的新的先进工作方法运用到实践中去。
    总结工农业先进经验，应当成为科学家和生产工作人员共同工作的最重要任务，不解决这个任务是不能够顺利地发展研究工作的。直到最近为止，这个工作被断断续续地进行着，而且远不是所有科学机关都进行。必须把先进经验的总结放进每个科学机关的工作制度中去，举行联席会议，举行周密地筹备的由科学家和实际工作人员作报告的代表会议，出版总结先进经验的共同著作，——这应当成为我们日常的工作方式。科学工作人员和生产工作人员这样往来的结果，必定将产生科学还没有解决的问题。这些问题将需要由科学组织研究。
    科学院的科学机关和各部的研究院的工作的协调，在这方面有非常的意义。使苏联科学院、各加盟共和国科学院、专门学院以及有关的部，严重地注意这个，是极必要的。
    科学机关和生产企业根据合作的合同来进行的共同工作，这是整个链子的环节，必须抓住它来在实际上扩大科学和生产联系的阵线。科学机关和企业的领导者必须研究共同工作的经验，并且今后必须这样组织和指引这些共同工作，使得被解决的不是细小的局部的任务，而是有巨大前途的问题。在这样的情形下，在创造上合作的效果，将大大增加。必须不但从科学院和高等学校方面，而且从各部方面，大大加强对共同的协力的科学工作的注意。
    在创造上合作是科学机关工作条件下社会主义竞赛的基本内容。最迅速地解决发展国民经济中的迫切的科学问题，并且把它们运用到实践中去，要把这些任务当作个别科学工作人员和整个科学机关的社会主义竞赛公约的基础。这只有在科学家和生产工作人员在创造上合作的条件下才可能完成。要这样组织事情：使得竞赛是两方面的，即使科学组织和生产组织在同样程度上参加竞赛。现在这种社会主义竞赛还很少被注意到。
    科学工作人员和生产工作人员在创造上的合作，是社会爱国运动，它的实现是由于苏联人加快发展苏联科学、技术、经济和文化各方面速度的企望所引起的。这个千百万人的运动，是由共产主义建设的成就，由我们的生活样式准备好了的，在这种生活样式中每个科学和生产工作人员都是共产主义社会的积极建设者。这样的合作是和社会主义制度血肉相关的，是从我们国家和社会结构的基础上产生的。
    既然在创造上合作是社会运动，那么党、工会和社会团体在这运动中的组织作用是巨大的。这些组织的任务在于在科学干部中进行日常的教育工作，以马克思—列宁主义理论武装他们，指引科学工作人员努力完成经济和文化建设的最重要任务。
    党的组织必须帮助科学机关巩固跟实践的联系，尽力帮助提高科学工作水平，以在科学中高度思想性和原则性的精神，以布尔什维克的批评和自我批评的精神来教育科学工作人员。我们要更广泛地更充分地在各门知识中采用批评和自我批评的方法。必须使用这个方法的全副巨大力量来发展苏联科学。
    苏联科学家把加强我们祖国的威力当作自己的神圣义务。他们不惜自己的力量来完成共产党、斯大林同志向苏联科学所提出的任务。他们将以更坚忍倔强的精神，在一九五二年跟工农业工作人员的合作中，为发展先进的苏联科学而工作。
    我们不能以已得的成果自慰。科学和生产在创造上的合作，已走了头几步。把更多更多的科学工作人员和生产工作人员吸引到这个运动去的巨大工作，摆在前面。为列宁—斯大林的伟大思想所鼓舞的苏联科学家正在把自己全部力量和知识献给建设共产主义社会的事业。（李何译）
