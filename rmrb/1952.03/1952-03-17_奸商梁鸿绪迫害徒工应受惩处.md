    Unscrupulous Merchant Liang Hongxu Should Be Punished for Persecuting Apprentice Workers

    To the Editor: Liang Hongxu, an unscrupulous merchant and owner of the Yonghe Iron Factory in Qiqihar City, used various methods to persecute his apprentices in order to seek exorbitant profits. In the winter of 1950, Liang Hongxu bought three Japanese military-use poison gas canisters, modified them into automobile gas tanks for sale, and obtained profits as high as five times the cost. Seeing that there was profit to be made, the unscrupulous merchant forced his apprentices to do illegal things.

    Last February, he ordered his apprentice Zhao Baoquan to burn the lids of the "poison gas canisters" in the backyard. Zhao was immediately poisoned by the gas. Soon, Zhao's condition worsened day by day. His waist became crooked, his chest swelled, and his stomach bloated like a pregnant woman. The unscrupulous merchant not only refused to allow him to receive treatment but also forced Zhao to work harder. Zhao Baoquan had no choice but to go home to take medicine after work. The next day, the unscrupulous merchant threatened Zhao, saying, "Things are missing from the counter! Don't come home anymore." Seeing that Zhao was really too sick, he introduced Zhao to his relative Liu Xibo for treatment. But Liu said, "There's nothing wrong with him!" After repeated delays, Zhao's illness was finally deemed incurable. Now, Zhao's buttocks are rotten, and he has lost consciousness; he is nearing death. Zhao's father was driven mad by this. I request the People's Government to severely punish Liang Hongxu according to the law.

    奸商梁鸿绪迫害徒工应受惩处
    编辑同志：齐齐哈尔市私营永和铁工厂奸商梁鸿绪为了谋取暴利，用种种办法迫害徒工。一九五零年冬天，梁鸿绪买来日寇军用的毒瓦斯罐三个，改修成汽车瓦斯罐出售，获暴利竟达五倍。奸商看到有利可图，就强迫徒工做违法的勾当。
    去年二月，他叫徒工赵保全在后院烧“毒瓦斯罐”盖，当场赵被毒气薰坏了。不久，赵病势日增，腰也斜了，前胸也肿了，肚子涨得像孕妇。奸商不但不让治疗，还强迫赵加点工作。赵保全只好下班后回家吃药。第二天奸商就威胁赵说：“柜上丢东西啦！你再不要回家了。”他看见赵实在病得太重了，才介绍赵到他的亲戚刘锡伯那里去治。但刘却说：“什么病也没有！”经过一再耽误，赵的病终于被证明不能再治了。现在，赵的屁股已烂，人已失去知觉；迫近死亡。赵父因此气疯了。我要求人民政府依法严惩梁鸿绪。　王占
