Indian audiences believe that the film "Steel Warrior" is full of fighting power and heroic spirit, and is an infinite inspiration to the Indian people. The revolutionary image of Platoon Leader Zhang, unyielding and unbending, in the film "Steel Warrior" has left a very deep impression on the audience.
