(Xinhua News Agency, March 20th) All members of the Southwest Nationalities Visiting Group, currently in Beijing, held a meeting on the 19th to vehemently protest the towering crime of U.S. imperialism spreading bacteria in Korea and Chinese territory. At the meeting, members of various ethnic groups expressed their extreme anger at this atrocity committed by the American aggressors. Minority ethnic group members from Yunnan Province said, "Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, our people of all ethnic groups lived like animals. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party led us to turn over a new leaf, and our grain harvests are abundant and our livestock are thriving. U.S. imperialism is unwilling to see us turn over a new leaf and engages in bacteriological warfare, which is outrageous and inhumane. Now we understand that the plague is inseparable from U.S. imperialism. We support Premier Zhou's statement. We, all ethnic groups, must unite to oppose this despicable crime of U.S. imperialism." Guo Ji Mu Gu, an Yi nationality person, said, "In the past, we Yi people did not know how many people died from fighting vendettas and from diseases. After liberation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we no longer fight vendettas. The People's Government has established hospitals in minority areas to help us reduce deaths from diseases. We were happy to have gained a happy life, but the American aggressors came to harm us and attempted to kill us with bacteriological weapons. I am extremely resentful." Suo Guan Ying, a Tibetan, said, "The bacteriological warfare waged by U.S. imperialism violates international law, and the Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world cannot tolerate it. We want to lodge a serious protest on behalf of tens of millions of minority people in the Southwest region."

Members of all ethnic groups expressed their determination to stop the atrocities of the American aggressors. Hao Su Fen, an Yi woman, said, "After I go back, I am determined to conduct in-depth propaganda among women compatriots so that everyone recognizes the ruthlessness of the American aggressors." Zhong Sa Living Buddha, a Tibetan, said, "I want to call on the lamas of all monasteries and my disciples to rise up against the atrocities of the American aggressors." At the meeting, members of all ethnic groups unanimously pledged to conduct widespread and in-depth propaganda after returning, to mobilize the masses to work hard in production, to strengthen epidemic prevention work, and to make the country prosperous so as to enhance the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea. They also specifically proposed to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea in minority areas and to defend the borders of the motherland.

Members of all ethnic groups firmly believe: "With the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, it is entirely possible to defeat U.S. imperialism." Ma Luan, a mountain youth, said, "The brutal U.S. imperialism is becoming increasingly isolated, and the strength of our peace-loving people is infinitely strong." Lin Shang Qing, a Hui person, said, "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, with the close unity and heroic struggle of the Chinese and Korean people, and with the righteous support of the people of the world, we have the strength and confidence to eliminate the American robbers."

At the meeting, all members of the visiting group unanimously passed a letter of protest, the full text of which is as follows:

The American aggressors have been beaten bloody and bruised by the armies of the Chinese and Korean people on the Korean battlefield and are becoming increasingly isolated and desperate. Recently, regardless of international law and human justice, it has frantically and heinously dropped insects carrying poisonous bacteria in large quantities in Korea and in our Northeast and Qingdao, attempting to use poisonous bacteria to slaughter the peace-loving people of China and Korea in order to salvage its already decided fate of defeat on the Korean battlefield. We, all members of the Southwest Nationalities Visiting Group, express our infinite anger at this despicable, ruthless, and towering crime of the American aggressors.

The brutal behavior of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons fully demonstrates that they are the mortal enemies of the Korean people, the mortal enemies of the people of all ethnic groups in China, and the mortal enemies of the people of the world. From this towering crime of the American aggressors, we have a clearer understanding of the ferocious face and viperous heart of U.S. imperialism.

We fully support the statement of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on March 8 and the joint protest of our democratic parties. In order to stop the towering crimes of the American aggressors and severely punish the American murderers who launched bacteriological warfare, we, the Chinese brothers and sisters of all ethnic groups, are determined to unite even more closely on the basis of the unprecedented unity we already have, so that our movement to resist America and aid Korea can advance on a more magnificent scale.

We are representatives of various ethnic minorities in the Southwest, representing thirty-six different ethnic groups. We came to the capital from the Southwest and deeply appreciate the greatness and loveliness of our motherland. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, our motherland is moving towards an infinitely bright and splendid future. We are deeply proud to be people of the People's Republic of China, and we are deeply proud that our motherland today stands at the forefront of defending world peace. In the struggle against American imperialist aggression and defending world peace, we are becoming stronger and stronger as we fight. The despicable goals that the American aggressors cannot achieve on the Korean battlefield with planes, cannons, and the rogue tactics of obstructing the armistice negotiations will never be achieved by using bacteriological warfare. The more brutal and crazy it is, the more isolated it becomes, and the closer it gets to collapse and death, and in the end, it will never escape the sanctions of justice. We firmly believe that victory will surely belong to the Chinese and Korean people, and to all people who uphold justice and love peace.

    西南各民族参观团全体人员在京集会
    决心加强团结粉碎美军细菌战
    【新华社二十日讯】来京参观的西南各民族参观团全体人员在十九日集会，严重抗议美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国境内撒布细菌的滔天罪行。会上各民族团员纷纷对美国侵略者的这一暴行表示极大的愤怒。云南省的少数民族团员说：“我们各族人民在国民党反动统治下，过着牛马一般的生活，毛主席、共产党领导我们翻了身，我们的粮食丰收、六畜兴旺。美帝国主义不甘心我们翻身，伤天害理、灭绝人性地进行细菌战。现在我们知道了，瘟疫是和美帝国主义分不开的。我们拥护周外长的声明。我们各民族要团结起来，一致反对美帝国主义这种可耻的罪行。”彝族人士果基木古说：“以前我们彝族打冤家死的、害病死的人不知有多少。解放后，在毛主席领导下，我们不再打冤家了。人民政府在少数民族地区设立医院，帮助我们减少疾病死亡。我们正高兴获得了幸福的生活，美国侵略者就来危害我们，并企图用细菌武器来杀害我们，我心里非常愤恨。”藏族人士索观瀛说：“美帝国主义进行的细菌战是违犯国际公法的，我们中国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民都不能容忍。我们要代表西南地区数千万少数民族人民提出严重的抗议。”
    各族团员对于制止美国侵略者的暴行，都表示了自己的决心。彝族妇女豪素芬说：“我回去后下决心在妇女同胞中，深入地进行宣传，使大家都认识美国侵略者的狠毒。”藏族仲萨活佛说：“我要号召各寺院的喇嘛和自己的徒弟都起来反抗美国侵略者的暴行。”各族团员在会上并一致保证回去后要普遍和深入地进行宣传，发动群众努力生产，加强防疫工作，使国家富裕起来，以增强抗美援朝的力量。他们并特别提出，要加强少数民族地区的抗美援朝工作，保卫祖国的边疆。
    各民族团员都坚决相信：“有毛主席、共产党的领导，是完全可以打败美国帝国主义的。”山头族青年麻鸾说：“残暴的美帝国主义越来越孤立，我们爱好和平的人民的力量是无限雄厚的。”回族人士林尚清说：“在毛主席和共产党的领导下，在中、朝人民紧密团结、英勇斗争下，在全世界人民正义支持下，我们有力量、有信心消灭美国强盗。”
    参观团的全体人员，在会议上一致通过了一个抗议书，全文如下：
    美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上已被中、朝人民的军队打得头破血流、日益孤立和绝望。最近它悍然不顾国际公法和人类正义，丧心病狂地在朝鲜和我国的东北、青岛大量投掷带有毒菌的昆虫，企图用毒菌来屠杀中、朝两国的和平人民，以挽救它在朝鲜战场上业已决定了的失败命运。对于美国侵略者这一卑劣、狠毒的滔天罪行，我们西南各民族参观团全体人员表示无限的愤怒。
    美国侵略者使用细菌武器的残暴行为，充分说明了它是朝鲜人民的死敌，是中国各民族人民的死敌，也是全世界人民的死敌。我们从美国侵略者这
    一滔天罪行中，更加清楚地认识到美帝国主义的狰狞面目和蛇蝎心肠。
    我们完全拥护三月八日我外交部周恩来部长的声明和我国各民主党派的联合抗议。为了制止美国侵略者的滔天罪行，严惩发动细菌战的美国凶手，我们中国各兄弟民族坚决在已有的空前团结的基础上更紧密地团结起来，使我们的抗美援朝运动以更壮阔的规模前进。
    我们是西南各少数民族的代表，代表着三十六种不同的民族。我们从西南来到首都，深深地体会到我们祖国的伟大可爱。在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，我们的祖国正向着无限光明灿烂的前途迈进。我们深以自己是中华人民共和国的人而感到骄傲，深以自己祖国今天站在保卫世界和平的最前线而感到骄傲。在反对美国帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争中，我们愈战愈强。美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上用飞机大炮和阻挠停战谈判的无赖手段所不能达到的卑鄙目的，使用细菌战也是决不可能达到的。它越凶残、越疯狂，它就越孤立、越走近崩溃死亡，最后绝逃不脱正义的制裁。我们坚信，胜利必然属于中、朝人民，属于一切维护正义、爱好和平的人民。
