    The Central Political Bureau of the Romanian Workers' Party issued a resolution in July 1949, deciding to establish a huge printing and publishing center – the "Spark" Building – in the suburbs of the capital, Bucharest.

    The decision to build the "Spark" Building was immediately met with enthusiastic support from the broad masses of the Romanian people. Hundreds of thousands of working people donated funds for this publishing center, and many workers came from all over the country to participate in the construction project. Thanks to the workers' enthusiastic and selfless labor, the "Spark" Building completed 105.3 percent of its construction tasks for the entire year of 1950 in just six months; the construction work in 1951 was also completed at the fastest speed. Now, a building that is the tallest in the country has been erected on 136,000 square meters of land. The main construction projects such as the composing room, distribution department, stereotype department, and web press room have all been completed within the past year, and 475 different machines will soon be installed in the building.

    The productivity of this printing and publishing center will be unprecedented in Romania. The huge web press is 62 meters long, 8 meters wide, 6 meters high, and weighs 750,000 kilograms. It can print 3,445,000 copies of newspapers in four hours. The speed of the book printing machines is also astonishing: they can print 100,000 booklets and paperbacks per hour, and 43,500 hardback books. Some machines can also print color books.

    All printing and publishing processes in this building are mechanized. Stereotypes are sent from the composing room to the web press by special conveyor belts, and newsprint is also sent out from the paper warehouse by machines. The printed newspapers are immediately transported by conveyor belts to the distribution department, where they are packaged by machines and sent to trucks for distribution throughout the country.

    The construction project of the "Spark" Building received assistance from the Soviet Union in terms of materials, technology, and other aspects. More than 450 machines were supplied by the Soviet Union's machine manufacturing industry, some of which were specially designed for the "Spark" Building. Soviet experts also helped with the design and execution of the entire construction project.

    The establishment of the "Spark" Building printing and publishing center is an important event in Romania's cultural construction. It will greatly increase the number of copies of the Romanian Workers' Party's central organ, "Spark" newspaper, and Party publications, and greatly increase the number of school textbooks, political, and technical readings published to meet the growing cultural and knowledge needs of the broad working people.

    火花大厦——罗马尼亚的印刷出版中心
    罗马尼亚工人党中央政治局曾在一九四九年七月颁布了一项决议，决定在首都布加勒斯特近郊建立一个巨大的印刷出版中心——“火花大厦”。
    建筑“火花大厦”的决定，立刻受到了罗马尼亚广大人民的热烈拥护。成千成万的劳动人民为这个出版中心捐献基金，许多工人从全国各地前来参加建筑工程。由于工人们的热情的忘我的劳动，“火花大厦”一九五○年全年的建筑任务，仅在半年内就完成了计划的百分之一百零五点三；一九五一年的建筑工程也以最快的速度完成了。现在，在十三万六千平方公尺的土地上，已经矗立起一座在全国最高的建筑物。排字房、发行部、铸版部和卷筒印刷机器房等主要的建筑工程都已在去年内建筑完成，最近即将在建筑物内安装四百七十五架各种不同的机器。
    这个印刷、出版中心的生产力，在罗马尼亚将是空前的。巨大的卷筒机长六十二公尺，宽八公尺，高六公尺，重达七十五万公斤。它在四小时内可以印刷三百四十四万五千份报纸。书籍印刷机器的速度也是十分惊人的：每小时可以印出十万本小册子与平装书，和四万三千五百本精装书籍。有一些机器还可以印套色的书籍。
    这座大厦内所有的印刷、出版过程都是机械化的。铅版由特别的输送带从排字房送到卷筒机，白报纸也从纸库里由机器送出来。印成后的新闻报纸立刻被输送带送往发行部，再在那里用机器打包送上货车，分发全国各地。
    “火花大厦”的建筑工程，得到了苏联在物资、技术和其他方面的帮助。四百五十架以上的机器都是由苏联的机器制造工业所供给的，其中有一些还是特别为“火花大厦”所设计的。苏联专家并且还帮助整个建筑工程的设计与执行。
    印刷出版中心“火花大厦”的建立，是罗马尼亚文化建设事业中的重要事件。它将使罗马尼亚工人党的中央机关报“火花报”和党的出版物的数量大大地增加，使学校教科书、政治和技术读物的出版数量大大地增加起来，以满足广大劳动人民在文化与知识方面的日益增长的需要。
