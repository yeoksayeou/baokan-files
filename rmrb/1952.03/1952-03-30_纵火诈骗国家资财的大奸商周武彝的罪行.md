The criminal Zhou Wuyi, a treacherous merchant who committed arson to defraud national assets, was the manager of the privately-owned Wuhan Sawmill in Wuhan City. Before liberation, he colluded with reactionary officials such as Xu Huizhi, the pseudo-mayor of Hankou, to operate Xingchu Company and Mingxin Salt Shop, specializing in gold, silver, and cotton yarn speculation. At the beginning of liberation, he concealed the official assets that accounted for one-half of the shares of the Wuhan Sawmill and intensified speculative activities. He converted the factory's inventory into gold, merged it with part of Xingchu Company's gold, and engaged in large-scale financial sabotage and market disruption in Chongqing, Changsha, and other places. At the same time, Zhou Wuyi colluded with more than 20 privately-owned sawmill merchants and secretly met at the International Hotel to conspire. When the Hubei Provincial Highway Bureau ordered bridge square timber, they raised the price of timber by more than 50%. In this one instance alone, Zhou Wuyi's company stole more than 50 million yuan of state property. Later, in undertaking a large number of orders from the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, they adopted collective bidding methods to defraud the state of a large amount of property. The treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi used tricks to win over his peers and was therefore elected as the chairman of the Wuhan Sawmill Industry Association, becoming the chief planner and organizer of the treacherous merchant group that harmed the interests of the country and the people. In timber transactions with state organs and enterprises, Zhou Wuyi used the fraudulent tricks of "measuring small when entering, measuring large when exiting, measuring broad when entering, measuring English when exiting" (note: the broad unit is 52 units more per hundred than the English unit), as well as corrupting cadres, cutting corners, delaying delivery, and so on, to carry out theft. According to preliminary statistics, the treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi bribed and corrupted more than 30 cadres from more than 20 units, including the Henan Provincial Construction Company, Henan University, the Henan Provincial Huai River General Headquarters, and a certain ordnance department. Among the batch of timber that the treacherous merchant handed over to the Henan Provincial Huai River General Headquarters for the Huai River project, 25% was moldy and rotten, and 40% was edged and substandard goods. Due to the delay in delivery, it also affected the completion of the Shimantan Reservoir as scheduled. As for the tricks in tax evasion, he used every means possible.

The greed of treacherous merchants will never be satisfied. In July 1951, the treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi colluded with Gong Xianli from the privately-owned Zhongnan Bank to introduce to the People's Bank of China that most of the timber in the Xinghua Wharf material factory of the Wuhan Sawmill was mortgaged for a loan of 200 million yuan. On the same day, he over-reported the value of this batch of timber to more than 300 million yuan and insured it with the Wuhan Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China for a fire insurance amount of 300 million yuan. On the one hand, he used the mortgaged funds for speculation and profiteering, and on the other hand, he stole and sold the mortgaged goods. He successively stole and sold 170 English units of fir tongue-and-groove boards, 1,200 bundles of mud strips, 40 English units of fir square boards, and 60 English units of pine, with a total value of more than 100 million yuan. Then, through Gong Xianli, he inquired about information. The treacherous merchant moved all the broken wooden boards and waste scraps in the factory and arranged them properly in the mortgaged goods. Gong Xianli inspected them first, and then used this to deceive the inspection personnel of the People's Bank. At this time, the treacherous merchant further implemented his premeditated plan of arson and fraud. A few days after the inspection, in early August, the treacherous merchant personally went to the material factory and asked the person in charge of materials (his trusted nephew Zhou Yingxin) to calculate that the total value of this batch of timber was only about 100 million yuan, so that Zhou Yingxin "had a number in his mind." In order not to involve too many people after the fire, on August 9th and 11th, he paid off the loan from the People's Bank of China twenty days in advance; and once again withdrew a portion of the timber for sale. Then he instructed Zhou Yingxin: "This timber is insured for 300 million yuan! You can set a fire on any day, and we will not be afraid of not having business to do after receiving the compensation! You must know that the meat is fat and the soup is also fat!" And further instructed Zhou Yingxin: "The fire should be started from the No. 2 warehouse next to the shantytown, and it must not be said that the fire started from our factory, but should be attributed to the shantytown; otherwise, our factory will not be able to bear the responsibility."

On August 16th, also the fifth day after the treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi had just paid off the loan from the People's Bank of China in advance, at noon when the material factory was on mid-month holiday, the arsonist Zhou Yingxin, according to the instructions of the treacherous merchant, lit the prepared shavings and thatched sheds in the No. 2 warehouse and quickly returned to the dormitory to pretend to take a nap. Soon the fire spread, burning the shantytowns outside the factory to the ground. The arsonist Zhou Yingxin pretended to be panicked, took a fire extinguisher to put out the fire, and ran to the factory to report the news. The residents outside the factory wailed, and the clothes and bedding of many employees in the factory were also burned to ashes because no one moved them. A total of 19 residents' houses were burned down, leaving 56 men, women, and children homeless. Fortunately, the fire brigade and fire trucks fought hard to extinguish the fire, so that the fire did not spread further. When the treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi heard the news, he also pretended to be panicked, but in his heart, he was complacent because his conspiracy had initially succeeded. That night, he leisurely strolled the streets with his mistress.

The next day, the treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi immediately convened a meeting of all factory employees and shouted to all employees: "It's terrible! The factory is going to collapse! Let's see how the insurance company's fire compensation will be!" And he publicized everywhere: "The fire was caused by the shantytown." The treacherous merchant also instructed the employees: if you hear others say that the fire was caused by the shantytown, write down their names so that you can use it as proof for applying for compensation; if you hear anyone say that the fire was caused by the material factory, ask them "Did you see it with your own eyes? Do you dare to issue a certificate and bear legal responsibility!" Zhou Wuyi was so all-powerful, framing the innocent, and falsely accusing the victim Wang Fenglian, who was burned to the ground, as the "fire starter." The Fourth Branch of the Wuhan Public Security Bureau and the Shengli Street Police Station, and the Third District People's Court of Wuhan City, did not conduct in-depth investigations, listened to the one-sided words of the treacherous merchant, and defended the treacherous merchant everywhere, causing Yang Wang Fenglian to be imprisoned for up to four months. At the same time, the treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi ordered the factory accountant to rush to make false accounts for three days and three nights, falsely reporting losses of nearly 600 million yuan to the Wuhan Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China; at the same time, through Gong Xianli of the Zhongnan Bank, he heavily bribed Qian Jiatai (a retained personnel and a big embezzler), the former deputy manager of the Central and Southern China Company of the People's Insurance Company of China, and Zhang Changda (a retained personnel and an embezzler) of the Disaster Prevention and Claims Department who came to inspect the fire scene, colluding with each other to defraud state property. When selling the remaining burnt timber, the treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi did not let go of the opportunity to take advantage of it. He cordially entertained the cadres of the insurance company and colluded with timber merchants to lower the price of timber, which should have been at least 14,000 yuan per load, to 6,000 yuan per load, and weighed it with a large scale that could produce 40 pounds more per load, in order to increase the amount of compensation. The big treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi systematically committed arson to defraud property, shifted the blame to others, and defrauded the insurance company of more than 260 million yuan in compensation. The treacherous merchant's factory's capital and materials increased; those shantytown residents who suffered from the fire were devastated. Yao's old lady's eyes were damaged in the fire; Li Guiying's child, a resident affected by the fire, died in the fire due to burns and illness; Wang Fenglian was not only looted by the fire but also falsely accused by the treacherous merchant and imprisoned for four months. These poor residents became the victims of the treacherous merchant's arson and fraud to get rich. The treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi said smugly that he made money in the fire. People should always remember the ugly face of the bourgeoisie: "He made money in the fire!"

The treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi's oppression and exploitation of workers was also extremely cruel. Liao Jinzhang was a hardworking and simple sawmill worker. He had to take care of the timber and saw wood in the riverbed. The excessive labor tortured him into a bag of bones, but the wages he deserved were always withheld by Zhou Wuyi. In June 1949 (after liberation), during the flood season, the riverbed was very deep, and Zhou Wuyi forced him to saw wood in the water, resulting in edema. Zhou Wuyi said inhumanly: "The work is busy, there is no time for him to see a doctor. The patient can't sleep at night, so it's reliable to lie on the wooden raft and guard the timber." The worker Liao Jinzhang was tortured to death by the treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi. In February 1951, the sawmill workers, under the call of the trade union, formulated a production plan, and Zhou Wuyi forced everyone to increase the production volume by one-fifth; in March, when accepting orders from Henan University, he forced everyone to complete ten days of work in four days. A sawing table should use three people, but he only allowed two workers. He insisted that one person carry timber that required two people to carry, causing many workers to cough up blood. The treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi distorted the government's call, threatening the workers: "Workers are in charge of the house, which means stepping up production; actively producing to resist the United States and aid Korea means that you can't rest when you have work to do." At that time, the factory was processing for a certain military supply department, and the treacherous merchant forced the workers to work overtime for ten consecutive nights; when the workers could not stand it and asked for a rest, the treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi threatened everyone: "If you don't work overtime, you are deliberately sabotaging military tasks and you are counter-revolutionaries."

The treacherous merchant's methods of ruling the workers were also very vicious. In August 1950, the Five Fortune Section Sawmill Group's trade union grassroots committee was established, and the treacherous merchant declared: "Whoever joins the trade union, get out of here!" To Wang Yehua and other six people who had kinship, he said: "In my factory, I don't allow my relatives to oppose me." At the end of 1950, the workers' consciousness in the factory improved, and 20 to 30 people united together and applied to join the union together. Seeing that the situation was difficult to resist, the treacherous merchant changed his approach and said: "You must be approved by me to join the union." On the other hand, he asked shareholder Su Weizhi to withdraw his shares on the surface and infiltrate the trade union; and used money and materials to seduce and buy over Wang Sili, a worker with an unstable position, to be his confidant. Later, Zhou Wuyi also bought over Gao Huarong, the chairman of the Five Fortune Section Committee of the Construction Trade Union Sawmill Industry, to establish a "labor-capital joint venture" "Production Exchange Meeting." In this way, the leadership of the workers' own class organization - the trade union - was once again usurped by the treacherous merchant using the means of "sending in" and "pulling out." He used these lackeys to monitor the workers. When workers read the newspaper, Wang Sili neither participated nor left, eavesdropping on the workers' speeches and reporting the information, and mocking and ridiculing anyone who made progressive remarks. Wang Sili also threatened the workers in the same way, saying: "We can only exercise dictatorship over the workers, and we can't talk about democracy with them."

After the "Five-Anti" movement began, the treacherous merchant still thought that he had the power to suppress the workers and could conceal his crimes, so on the one hand, he established a "defense alliance," and on the other hand, he used both soft and hard tactics to threaten and lure the workers, attempting to quibble and muddle through. But as soon as the inspection team arrived at the factory, they successively received 324 letters of accusation from inside and outside the factory. In the face of the workers' strict and strong team, the treacherous merchant's crimes were completely exposed. Now, the big treacherous merchant Zhou Wuyi and the accomplice Guo Songshan (deputy manager of Wuhan Sawmill) have been arrested and brought to justice by the Central and Southern Branch of the Supreme People's Court at the angry request of the masses.

    纵火诈骗国家资财的大奸商周武彝的罪行
    纵火诈骗国家资财的凶犯、大奸商周武彝，是武汉市私营武汉锯木厂的经理。解放前，他勾结伪汉口市长徐会之等反动官僚，经营兴楚公司、铭新盐号，专做金、银及棉纱投机买卖。解放之初，他隐藏占武汉锯木厂股份二分之一的官僚资产，并变本加厉进行投机活动，把厂内存货变换黄金、汇合兴楚公司一部黄金，在重庆、长沙等地大肆破坏金融、捣乱市场。同时，周武彝串通二十多家私营锯木厂奸商，在国际饭店密会合谋，乘湖北省公路局定购桥梁方木时，抬高木料价格百分之五十以上，这一次仅周武彝一家就盗骗了国家财产五千多万元。后在承做郑州铁路管理局大批定货中，他们采取集体抬标方法，诈骗国家大量财产。奸商周武彝玩弄手段，笼络同行，因此当选为武汉市锯木业公会的主任委员，做了奸商集团危害国家人民利益的主谋者和组织者。在和国家机关、企业木材交易中，周武彝以“小头量进、大头量出，广方量进、英方量出”的诈骗伎俩（按：广方较英方每百方多五十二方），以及腐蚀干部、偷工减料、延期交货等等，进行盗窃勾当。据初步统计，奸商周武彝曾行贿腐蚀河南省建筑公司、河南大学、河南省治淮总指挥部、某兵工署等二十几个单位的三十几个机关干部。在奸商交给河南省治淮总指挥部修治淮河工程需用的一批木材中，就有百分之二十五是霉烂的，百分之四十是边皮和次货；由于延期交货，并且影响了石漫滩水库不能如期完成。至于在偷税漏税中的花样，更是无所不用其极。
    奸商的利欲是永远也不会满足的，一九五一年七月间，奸商周武彝勾通私营中南银行的龚献利，向中国人民银行介绍，把武汉锯木厂兴华码头材料厂木材的大部抵押了两亿元贷款。同日，他又把这批木材报高为三亿多元，向中国人民保险公司武汉分公司投保火险额三亿元。他一面以押款投机倒把，一面盗卖押品，先后盗卖杉木企口板一百七十英方、泥条一千二百捆、杉木齐板四十英方、松木六十英方，总值一亿多元。然后，通过龚献利刺探情报，奸商把厂内所有破烂木板和边皮废料，搬置抵押品内摆设妥当，由龚献利先行察看，再以此矇混人民银行的查验人员。这时，奸商就进一步实行他预谋的纵火诈骗计划。查验后几天，八月上旬，奸商亲自到材料厂，要管材料的人（他的亲信侄子周应新）为他盘算出这批木料总值不过一亿左右，让周应新“心中有数”。为了不使放火后牵涉面过广，便在八月九日和十一日，提前二十多天两次还清了人民银行的押款；并再次抽走一部木料出卖。然后嘱咐周应新说：“这些木材保了三亿元的险！你可不管在那天放把火一烧，我们得到赔款还怕没有生意做？要知道肉肥汤也肥！”并进一步指示周应新：“放火要从紧邻棚户的二号货栈放起，决不能说是我厂起火，一概推到棚户身上；不然的话，责任我厂是负不了的。”
    八月十六日，也是奸商周武彝刚刚提前还清人民银行押款后的第五天中午，正值材料厂月中休假，放火凶犯周应新便按照奸商的指示，把预置在二号货栈的易燃的刨花和茅草冷棚上点了火，迅速回到宿舍佯装午睡。不久大火弥漫，把厂外棚户延烧一光。放火凶犯周应新故作惊惶，拿着灭火器救火，跑到厂里去报信。厂外被灾居民哭嚎连天，厂内许多职工的衣服、被褥也因无人搬运被焚一空。共计烧毁十九家居民的全部房屋，使男女老幼五十六人无家可归。幸经消防队救火车奋力灌救，才使火灾没有更为扩大。奸商周武彝闻讯时也佯装惊慌失措，但内心里却因阴谋计划初步得逞而自鸣得意，当天晚上就带着他的姘头悠闲地逛街。
    次日，奸商周武彝马上召开全厂职工大会，向全体职工大喊：“不得了！厂是要垮啦！只看保险公司火灾赔款如何了！”并且四出宣传：“火是从棚户引起的。”奸商并叮嘱职工们：听到别人说火是棚户引起的，就把名字给他记下来，好做为申请赔款的证明；听到谁说火是材料厂引起的，就问他们“亲眼见了没有？敢不敢具结负法律责任！”周武彝就是这样一手遮天，诬陷无辜，把被焚一空的灾民王凤莲诬为“火头”。武汉市公安局第四分局及胜利街派出所、武汉市第三区人民法院，不深入调查，听信奸商一面之词，处处为奸商辩护，使杨王凤莲身系冤狱达四个月之久。同时，奸商周武彝即令厂内会计三天三夜赶制假账，向中国人民保险公司武汉分公司虚报损失近六亿元；同时，通过中南银行龚献利，向到火灾场检查的中国人民保险公司中南区公司前副经理钱家泰（留用人员、大贪污犯）及防灾理赔股张昌达（留用人员、贪污分子）等大行其贿，互相串通诈骗国家财产。在出卖焚余木料时，奸商周武彝也不放过可乘之机，殷勤招待保险公司干部，同时勾结柴商，把每担最少要一万四千元一担的木材，压低为每担六千元，并以每担可多出四十斤的大秤秤出，以扩大赔偿额。大奸商周武彝就是这样有计划地纵火诈财，嫁祸于人，诈取了保险公司两亿六千多万元的赔款。奸商厂内资本和材料都增多了；那些遭受火灾的棚户居民，却遭了浩劫。姚老太婆的眼睛在火灾中薰坏了；被灾居民李桂英的小孩在火灾中连烧带病死去了；王凤莲不但被火灾洗劫一空，还被奸商诬陷坐牢四个月。这些贫苦居民，就成为奸商纵火诈财致富的牺牲者。奸商周武彝反而自鸣得意地说，他在火灾中赚了钱。人们应该永远记着资产阶级的这个丑恶脸嘴：“他在火灾中赚了钱！”
    奸商周武彝对于工人的压榨和剥削也是极端凶残的。廖金章是个勤劳朴实的锯木工人，他在河下既要看管木料又要去锯木头。过度繁重的劳动把他折磨成了一把骨头，但他应得的工资永远是克扣在周武彝的手里。一九四九年六月（解放以后了）涨水季节，河滩进了很深的水，周武彝还强迫他在水里锯木，结果泡出了黄肿病。周武彝毫无人性地说：“活正忙，那有时间给他看病。病人晚上睡不着觉，躺在木簰上看守木料正靠得住。”工人廖金章就是这样被奸商周武彝活活地折磨死了的。一九五一年二月份锯木工人在工会号召下订立生产计划，周武彝强迫大家要把生产量提高五分之一；三月间接受河南大学定货时，又强迫大家在四天内完成十天的工作。一个锯台上应用三个人，他只准用两个工人。要两个人抬的木料他硬要一个人扛，累得许多工人吐血。奸商周武彝歪曲政府的号召，威胁工人说：“工人当了家，就是要加紧生产；抗美援朝积极生产，就是有活干不能休息。”当时工厂内正为某军需部门加工，奸商便强迫工人一连加了十天的夜班；工人支持不住要求休息一下，奸商周武彝就威胁大家说：“你们不加夜班，就是有意破坏军事任务，就是反革命分子。”
    奸商统治工人的手段也是十分毒辣的。一九五零年八月，五福段锯木组工会基层委员会成立，奸商声言：“谁入工会就给我滚蛋！”对于具有亲属关系的王业华等六人则说：“在我这厂里，我不准许我的亲戚和我对立。”一九五零年底厂里工人觉悟提高了，二、三十个人团结一起，一块声请入会。奸商眼看大势难当，便改变方法说：“你们入会须经过我批准。”另一方面要股东苏维芝表面退股，打入工会；并以金钱物质引诱，把立场不坚定的工人王思礼收买，做为他的心腹。以后，周武彝又收买了建筑工会锯木业五福段委员会工会主席高华荣成立“劳资合办”的“生产交流会”。就这样，工人自己的阶级组织——工会的领导权，又被奸商用“派进去”和“拉出来”的手段篡夺了去。用他的这些狗腿监视工人。工人读报时，王思礼既不参加又不离开，窃听工人发言通风报信，听到谁发表进步的言论就冷嘲热讽。王思礼也照样威胁工人说：“对待工人只有专他们的政，不能跟他们讲民主。”
    “五反”运动开始后，奸商还自以为他有力量压制工人，可以把自己的罪行隐瞒过去，所以，一面订立“攻守同盟”，一面软硬并施威胁利诱工人，企图狡赖混关。但检查组一到厂里，就陆续收到厂内外三百二十四封检举信件。在工人阶级严整和强大的队伍面前，奸商的罪行完全被揭穿了。现在，大奸商周武彝、同谋犯郭嵩山（武汉锯木厂副经理）在群众愤怒的要求下，都已被最高人民法院中南分院逮捕法办。
