    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 12th: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth has issued a statement strongly protesting the serious crime of germ warfare committed by the American aggressors. The statement pointed out: "This act of destroying entire groups of residents through germ warfare, in violation of the basic principles of international law, once again proves that the masterminds of this crime are attempting to expand and escalate the war through inhumane means while sabotaging negotiations that could lead to a peaceful resolution."
    The statement said: "To achieve this goal, the United States has employed Japanese 'experts' who were convicted as war criminals for conducting germ warfare in the last World War. This not only reminds young people of the atrocities of fascist crimes, but also exposes the true meaning of the militarization of Japan."
    The statement said: "The World Federation of Democratic Youth lodges a strong protest to the American government, which is responsible for this heinous act; and demands that the United Nations immediately take measures, because the crimes committed in Korea are being masked by the flag of the United Nations."
    The World Federation of Democratic Youth finally called on the youth of the world to support the people and youth of Korea, to condemn and demand an end to the use of such barbaric weapons of mass destruction, and to unite in struggle to end the Korean War and conclude a peace pact to ensure a peaceful life for mankind and to make science serve the progress and happiness of mankind.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: TASS, Prague, March 11th: The Secretariat of the International Student Union has issued a letter of protest against the germ warfare conducted by the American armed forces in Korea. The letter of protest stated: The Secretariat of the International Student Union is deeply indignant upon hearing the news that the American armed forces are using bacteriological weapons in Korea. The Secretariat of the International Student Union calls on students all over the world to resolutely oppose the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and demands an end to this crime. The Secretariat of the International Student Union has also sent a letter to the United Nations, requesting the United Nations to take measures to stop the American interventionists from using bacteriological weapons in Korea.

    世界民主青联和国际学联发表声明
    号召世界青年制止美国细菌战
    【新华社布拉格十二日电】世界民主青年联盟书记处发表声明，强烈抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战的严重罪行。声明指出：“这种违反国际法基本原则、以细菌战来毁灭整批整批居民的行为，再度证明：这种罪行的主谋者，正企图在破坏可能导致和平解决的谈判的同时，使用灭绝人性的手段扩大战争，使战争更为严重。”
    声明说：“为了达到这个目的，美国起用了因在上次世界大战中进行细菌战而被宣判为战犯的日本‘专家’，这不仅使青年人想到法西斯罪行的惨状，而且揭露了日本军国主义化的真实意义。”
    声明说：“世界民主青年联盟向应对这种可恶行为负责的美国政府，提出强烈的抗议；并要求联合国组织立即采取措施，因为在朝鲜所干的罪行是用联合国的旗帜来掩盖的。”
    世界民主青年联盟最后号召全世界青年声援朝鲜人民和青年，谴责和要求制止使用这种野蛮的屠杀武器，并团结一致，进行斗争，争取结束朝鲜战争和缔结一个和平公约，以保障人类得到和平生活，并使科学为人类的进步和幸福服务。【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社布拉格十一日讯：国际学生联合会书记处顷发表反对美国武装部队在朝鲜进行细菌战的抗议书。抗议书说：国际学联听到美国武装部队在朝鲜使用细菌武器的消息，深感愤慨。国际学联书记处号召全世界的学生们坚决反对在朝鲜使用细菌武器，并要求停止这种罪行。国际学联书记处并致函联合国，要求联合国采取措施，制止美国干涉者在朝鲜使用细菌武器。
