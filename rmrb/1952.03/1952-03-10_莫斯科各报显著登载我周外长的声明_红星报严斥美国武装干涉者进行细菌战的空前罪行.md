Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 9th: Pravda, Izvestia, Labor Daily, Red Star, and other newspapers all prominently published Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn protest against the U.S. government's use of bacteriological weapons to massacre the Chinese people and violate Chinese airspace.

    Red Star newspaper published an international commentary on March 8th entitled "New Crimes of the American Aggressors." The article pointed out the facts of the American imperialists' crimes in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China, and then wrote: "The new crimes committed by the American aggressors are infuriating, a violation of international conventions prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons, and a violation of the basic standards of humanity. Facts prove that the American military command is using means of mass extermination according to plans drawn up long ago. As early as 1946, George Merck, chairman of the so-called Biological Warfare Problems Committee of the U.S. military, in a special report to the U.S. Department of the Army, talked about the U.S.'s achievements in biological warfare surpassing those of the Axis powers. For several years, the U.S. armed forces have been equipping all branches of the military with cadres for chemical and bacteriological warfare. This can be confirmed by the remarks of U.S. Secretary of the Army Pace. When Pace defined the mission of West Point graduates, he said that U.S. officers should be able to widely use psychological, chemical, biological, and radiological warfare methods. It is noteworthy that the U.S. military command is using the methods of Japanese war criminals in carrying out bacteriological warfare." Red Star listed the facts of the American aggressors' collusion with these war criminals. The newspaper said: "The new crimes of American imperialism have aroused the indignation of the entire progressive humanity. Peace-loving people condemn the bloody acts of American imperialism. The Soviet people, like all freedom-loving people in the world, curse the shameless American armed interventionists who have committed unprecedented crimes. The new crimes of the American aggressors expose them as enemies of all mankind."

    莫斯科各报显著登载我周外长的声明
    红星报严斥美国武装干涉者进行细菌战的空前罪行
    【新华社莫斯科九日电】真理报、消息报、劳动报、红星报等九日都以显著地位登载周外长严重抗议美国政府使用细菌武器屠杀中国人民、侵犯中国领空的声明。
    红星报八日以美国侵略者新罪行为题发表国际述评，该文指出美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器罪行的事实后写道：美国侵略者所犯的新罪行是令人愤怒的，是对于禁止使用细菌武器的国际公约的破坏，是对人道起码标准的破坏。事实证明，美国军事指挥部是按照早就拟定的计划使用大规模灭绝人类的手段。还在一九四六年，美军的所谓生物战问题委员会主席乔治·米尔克向美国陆军部的专门报告中，就已谈到美国在生物战方面的工作超过了轴心国家的成就。美国武装部队几年间已在一切兵种中配备着化学战和细菌战的干部。这可由美国陆军部长佩斯的言论证实。佩斯确定西点军校毕业生的使命时说，美军官应当会广泛地使用心理战、化学战、生物战和放射能战的手段。令人注意的情况是，美军指挥部使用着日本战犯进行细菌战的方法。红星报列举了美国侵略者与这些战犯勾结的事实。该报说：美帝国主义的新罪行引起了整个进步人类的义愤。爱好和平的人民斥责美帝国主义的血腥行为。苏联人民同世界一切爱好自由的人民一样，咒骂犯着空前罪行的美国武装干涉者的无耻。美国侵略者的新罪行暴露他们是全人类的敌人。
