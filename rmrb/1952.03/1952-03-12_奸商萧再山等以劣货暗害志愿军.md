    Unscrupulous Merchants Xiao Zaishan and Others Harmed the Volunteer Army with Inferior Goods

    To the Editor:

    The unscrupulous merchants Xiao Zaishan and Xiao Zaigang of the Beijing Meili Machinery Factory, driven by greed for exorbitant profits, sabotaged the great cause of resisting America and aiding Korea. In April and May of last year, they contracted to produce over 2,900 transport carts for the Volunteer Army. When contracting, they deliberately had the Tieying Iron Factory produce a sample cart, and then used this sample to inflate the price by more than double. They filled the iron pipes of the cart handles with sand, increasing the weight of each sample cart by nine and a half jin. With this alone, they stole over 20,000 jin of iron pipes from the state, worth 320 million yuan. During the construction process, they violated regulations and cut corners. According to regulations, all carts should be gas welded, but they secretly built five small wooden houses in the backyard and hid inside to electric weld over 400 carts. The unscrupulous merchants told the workers: "Weld away! It doesn't matter, they make their regulations, and we'll weld our way. Electric welding can make more money. Once the carts are pushed to the front lines, we won't see them again." More than a dozen of these carts broke down when they were transported to the Xizhimen Railway Station. How can such carts that break down with a single push cross mountains and rivers and be used for combat?

    The workers, because this batch of carts was intended for the front lines, worked overtime, hoping to complete the task as soon as possible. But the unscrupulous merchants used this as an excuse to deduct the processing fees of workers such as Deng Qingzhang and six others. The above-mentioned facts are only a part of the merchants' crimes. According to preliminary inspections, they have already caused the state losses of more than 1.4 billion yuan. We demand that the People's Government severely punish these traitors of the motherland.

    奸商萧再山等以劣货暗害志愿军
    编辑同志：北京美利机械厂奸商萧再山、萧再刚贪图暴利，破坏抗美援朝伟大事业。去年四、五月间，他们承包了志愿军用的运输小车二千九百多辆。承包时，他们故意让铁鹰铁工厂出面做小车样子，按此样抬高价格一倍以上。他们在小车手把的铁管内装上砂子，使每辆小车样子增加九斤半的重量，只这一项，他们就盗窃了国家铁管子两万多斤，价值三亿二千多万元。在施工过程中，他们违反规定，偷工减料。按规定，小车一律应气焊，但他们竟在后院盖了五间小木房，躲在屋里用电焊了四百多辆。奸商对工人说：“焊吧！没有关系，他规定他的，咱们焊咱们的。电焊可以多赚钱，车子推到前方后，咱们又见不到。”这些小车运到西直门车站时，就坏了十多辆。这种一推就坏的小车怎么能翻山越岭，作战斗之用？
    工人们因为这批小车是用于前方的，都加班加点，希望早日完成任务。而奸商却由此克扣工人邓庆彰等七人的加工费。上面所举事实只是奸商的罪行里面的一部分。据初步检查，他们已使国家损失了十四亿元之多。我们要求人民政府严惩这批祖国的叛徒。　何文芸
