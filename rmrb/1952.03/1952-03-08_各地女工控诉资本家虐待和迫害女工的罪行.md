Female Workers in Various Regions Accuse Capitalists of Abusing and Persecuting Female Workers

In the past three years, the bourgeoisie's frantic attacks on the working class have been particularly severe on female workers. Unlawful capitalists have exhausted all kinds of despicable and barbaric methods to deceive, abuse, and oppress female workers, extracting large amounts of illegal profits from them. In the current struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy work and the theft of state economic intelligence, female workers in various regions, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the trade unions, have angrily reported these crimes of the bourgeoisie, determined to repel the bourgeoisie's frantic attacks.

Cruelly Abusing Female Workers

After liberation, female workers, like male workers, became the leading class of the country. However, the bourgeoisie would not allow female workers to stand up; they still used the feudal and barbaric ruling methods of the old society to continue to oppress and abuse them. Capitalists of the "Hong Feng" and "Xie Cheng" silk factories in Wuxi City, Southern Jiangsu, allowed managers to beat female workers with iron nails and wooden sticks, and to kick female workers in the abdomen. A manager at the Suzhou Xinhua Silk Factory put the hand of female worker Li Ai'nan on a steam pipe and hit her palm, burning it from above and scalding it from below, until her hand was charred. The abuse of child laborers (female) in silk factories by capitalists was even more inhumane. Capitalists used iron wires to pierce the eyes and eyelids of child laborers; dragged child laborers by their ears in circles around the workshop; punished child laborers by making them stand facing a corner of the wall in the workshop, not allowing them to bend over, and slapping them if they moved; inserting chopsticks into the mouths of child laborers; pouring boiling water on the waists, feet, and breasts of child laborers; throwing scalding hot cocoons on child laborers; and putting child laborers' hands in boiling water. After the Southern Jiangsu Heta Silk Factory started operations in 1951, the capitalists scalded and beat child laborers about 330 times in a month or so. The chest of a nine-year-old child laborer at the Xiang Ji Silk Factory was scalded with a blister the size of a silver dollar. Yang Jin'di, a child laborer at the Suzhou Xinhua Silk Factory, committed suicide by drowning because she could not bear the scalding, beatings, and scolding from the capitalists.

Super-Economic Feudal Exploitation

In some private factories and shops, there still exists all kinds of super-economic feudal exploitation. Capitalists force female workers to give them gifts; and outside of working hours, they call on female workers to do various household chores for them. The manager of the private Zhonghua Agricultural Implements Cooperative in Jinan City ordered female employee Li Lianzhen to scrub his chamber pot, wash his clothes, and serve his "young mistress" at night. The capitalists of various private silk reeling factories in Southern Jiangsu used their cronies as managers, arbitrarily beating, scolding, insulting, punishing, and dismissing female workers; and forcing female workers to sew clothes and do chores without pay. In the early days of liberation, the capitalist of the Beijing Tongli Thread Factory, in order to make female workers work more, even had regulations such as: five minutes for each person to defecate, and two minutes to urinate. Some female workers were therefore forced to urinate and defecate in their pants. The capitalist of the Jinchengxiang Silk Factory in Hangzhou City forced female workers to work, making many female workers sick; four out of thirteen female workers vomited blood. Li Guoren, a treacherous merchant in Fushun City, owed female worker Liu Aiqin three months' salary, and his concubine lent the money back to Liu Aiqin at interest. This was actually Li Guoren, the treacherous merchant, lending Liu Aiqin her own salary at usurious rates.

Arbitrarily Dismissing Female Workers

Some private enterprises arbitrarily dismiss female workers. Many illegal capitalists hire temporary workers for a long time in order to dismiss or suspend female workers at any time. Temporary workers who continue to work for more than three months should have been converted into permanent workers, but the capitalists try every means to prevent female workers from becoming permanent workers. In the private dyeing and weaving factories in Tianjin, female workers who wind spindles and weft bobbins have worked for two or three years or even more than ten years, but are still called temporary workers by the capitalists. They have low wages, no welfare benefits, and no pay during holidays. The capitalists can also arbitrarily dismiss or suspend them. The Beijing Xinsheng Pharmaceutical Factory has more than 30 female workers. In order to prevent them from being converted from temporary workers to permanent workers, whenever the female workers are about to complete three months of work, the capitalists deceive the female workers saying that there is no work to do and tell them to go home; then they find another group of female workers to work. By rotating them in this way, some female workers have worked in this factory for several years, but still cannot become permanent workers. Zhang Hanchen, the capitalist of the Fengnian Confectionery Factory in Daowai, Harbin City, forced female workers to work overtime, and whoever refused to do so would be dismissed.

Equal Work, Unequal Pay

In order to seek exorbitant profits and undermine the unity of the working class, the bourgeoisie deliberately violated government decrees and adopted the method of equal work but unequal pay for female workers. Capitalists set up various pretexts, calling female workers temporary workers, outside workers, daily-paid workers, short-term workers, etc., in order to reduce wages, cruelly exploit the blood and sweat of female workers, and deprive female workers of welfare benefits. For example, the Tianjin Xiefeng Chemical Factory treats male workers as permanent workers, with an average monthly wage of 270 jin of corn flour, and a bonus of four months' wages per person at the end of the year; female workers are treated as temporary workers, with an average monthly wage of 200 jin of corn flour, and no bonus at all. All 95 female workers of the private Zhongnan Match Company in Xi'an City are treated as outside workers, and cannot enjoy any benefits such as housing, water, electricity, haircuts, and bathing. When the factory lays off workers, male workers are given two months' severance pay, while female workers are given nothing. In the Southern Jiangsu Zhengtai Silk Factory, the work ability of male and female reeling workers is the same. Male workers are paid monthly, with an average monthly salary of 48.8 practical units, and provided with meals and lodging; female workers are paid daily, with an average monthly wage of only 39 practical units, and no meals and lodging are provided. In the private factories in Taiyuan, female workers not only have lower wages than male workers, but even the standard for calculating wage rice prices is inconsistent. Male workers are calculated at a rice price of 930 yuan, while female workers are calculated at only 850 yuan. In some private cigarette factories in Jinan City, in 1950, the wages of male and female workers doing the same work differed by as much as three times.

Restricting Female Workers' Freedom of Marriage

The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China stipulates that men and women have freedom of marriage. However, self-serving capitalists, fearing that female workers having children would affect their work, do not hesitate to undermine the lifelong happiness of female workers by forbidding them from getting married. Some female workers at the Yonghui Hospital (privately run) in Quanzhou, Fujian, have been in the hospital for ten years and are now 30 years old, but the capitalists still do not allow them to marry, and whoever marries will be dismissed. Last year, the capitalist of the Yu Lan Ji Confectionery Factory in Beijing dismissed four female workers who were already married (the trade union protested, and the capitalist did not achieve the dismissal). He also divided the workers by saying: "There is little work in the factory, if a few people are removed, you can work a few more days." Illegal capitalists use the threat of hunger and unemployment to deprive female workers of their freedom of marriage in this way.

Insulting Female Workers

The licentious, shameless, corrupt, and degenerate bourgeoisie has always built their happiness on the suffering of others. Capitalists have no respect for the rights of women in the new society. They arbitrarily subject female workers and female employees in factories and shops to bestial insults. Yang Ziming, the nearly 60-year-old capitalist of the Zhonghua Agricultural Implements Cooperative in Jinan City, and his two sons, raped a female employee a total of eleven times. It was only during the anti-theft movement in the Jiufeng Weaving Factory in the Eighth District of Beijing that it was discovered that several female workers had been raped by the manager. Li Guoren, a treacherous merchant in Fushun City, raped a seventeen-year-old and a sixteen-year-old female worker. Some merchants, barbaric by nature, forced female workers to sell their bodies to attract business for him. Zhang Meilan, a female clerk at the Jiu Huitang Restaurant in Qingdao, accused the capitalist at the Qingdao Food Industry Clerks' Congress, saying: "We earn our living by our own labor, but the manager forced me to sell my body to attract business for him. When I drove away the hooligan who insulted me, the manager glared at me and told me to leave the restaurant." Some private factories still have body searches. When workers at the Yu Lan Ji Confectionery Factory in Beijing got off work, the capitalist's wife would search the female workers, even touching the knots on the female workers' trouser belts before allowing them to leave the factory.

Depriving Female Workers of Political Rights

After liberation, all male and female workers have the freedom to apply to join and organize trade unions. However, capitalists are afraid of worker unity and afraid of workers' increased awareness. Therefore, they do not hesitate to violate national laws and try every means to prevent female workers from participating in trade unions and all political activities. A private handicraft towel factory in Ximen, Fuzhou, hired four female workers to weave towels upstairs, not allowing them to go downstairs to participate in activities or join trade union organizations. Several female workers at the Yuandong Belt Buckle Factory in Nanshi District, Shenyang City, joined the trade union in 1951. The capitalists wanted to dismiss them, but the trade union did not agree, so the capitalists threatened to close down the factory. The capitalist of the Tian Licheng Carpet Factory in Tianjin even threatened the female workers who had joined the trade union, saying: "You join the trade union, and you will regret it sooner or later." And he scolded the female workers, saying: "Those who join the trade union are simply crazy!" Last year, female workers in the dyeing and weaving industry in the northern district of Kunming were beaten by the capitalists when they returned from the "March 8" International Women's Day parade.

Deceiving Female Workers and Alienating Female Workers from the Government

Self-serving capitalists never care about the welfare of female workers. They even deliberately distort government decrees to deceive female workers. For example, after the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, many capitalists did not implement them. In the past, the Beijing Dalu Binding Office always gave the money from selling the cut paper edges to the workers. After the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, the capitalist deceived the female workers, saying: "Wages during maternity leave will come out of the paper edges." He asked the female workers for their opinions, saying: "Do you want maternity leave wages or paper edge money?" As a result, unmarried female workers wanted paper edge money, and married female workers wanted maternity leave wages. The capitalist used this opportunity to divide the female workers' solidarity and decided to give the female workers paper edge money but not maternity leave wages, in order to win over the majority of unmarried female workers. In order to alienate female workers from the People's Government, the capitalist of the Wuhan Universe Cigarette Factory deliberately raised the wages of female workers and held a few welfare events to win over the workers and blur the workers' class consciousness; then he cried to the female workers, saying: "The government's taxes are heavy! The factory is going to lose money!" He wanted to deceive the female workers into asking the government for tax cuts for him.

    各地女工控诉资本家虐待和迫害女工的罪行
    三年来，资产阶级向工人阶级猖狂进攻的事实，表现在女工方面是尤其严重的。违法资本家用尽种种卑鄙的、野蛮的手法，欺骗、虐待、压迫女工，从女工身上榨取了大批的非法利润。在当前反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争中，各地女工群众在中国共产党和工会的领导下，纷纷愤怒地检举了资产阶级的这些罪行，决心打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻。
    残酷地虐待女工
    解放以后，女工也和男工一样，成为国家的领导阶级。可是，资产阶级不让女工翻身，他们仍采用旧社会封建野蛮的统治办法，继续欺压、虐待女工。苏南无锡市“鸿丰”、“协成”两个丝厂的资本家让管理员用铁钉、木棒打女工，用脚踢女工腹部。苏州新华丝厂管理员把女工李爱男的手放在水汀管上，打手心，上面打，下面烫，手都被烫焦了。丝厂资本家对盆工（女童工）的虐待更是惨无人道。资本家用铁丝刺盆工的眼睛、眼皮；拉着盆工的耳朵在车道里兜圈子；罚盆工在车间里立壁角
    （即让女工面对墙壁角站立），不许弯腰，动了就打耳光；用筷子插在盆工的嘴里；用开水泼盆工的腰部、脚上和乳房；把滚烫的茧子丢在盆工身上；把盆工的手放在开水里烫。苏南和泰丝厂一九五一年开工后，资本家一个月左右烫打盆工三百三十次。祥记丝厂九岁的盆工胸部被烫得起了银元大的一个泡。苏州新华丝厂盆工杨金娣因受不了资方烫、打、骂，而投河自杀。
    超经济的封建剥削
    在某些私营工厂、商店里面，还存在着种种超经济的封建剥削。资本家强迫女工给他们送礼；在工作时间以外，叫女工替他们干各种家常事务工作。济南市私营中华农具社的经理，叫女职员李联珍替他擦尿盆、洗衣服，晚上还要侍候“少奶奶”。苏南各私营缫丝厂的资本家，利用自己的亲信做管理员，任意打骂、侮辱、处罚、开除女工；并强迫女工缝衣服和做杂务等没有报酬的工作。北京同立线厂的资本家，为了要女工多干活，解放初期还有这样的规定：每人大便时间五分钟，小便时间二分钟。有的女工因此逼得把屎尿拉在裤子里。杭州市锦成祥绸厂资本家逼迫女工干活，把很多女工累病了，十三个女工就有四个女工吐了血。抚顺市一个奸商李国仁拖欠女工刘爱琴三个月的工资，他的小老婆又把钱借给女工刘爱琴生利。这实际上是奸商李国仁用女工刘爱琴自己的工资，向刘爱琴放高利贷。
    任意解雇女工
    某些私营企业任意解雇女工。许多违法资本家为了随时解雇女工或停止女工工作，长期雇用临时工。临时工继续工作三个月以上的，本来应该转为长工，但是，资本家千方百计地不让女工转为长工。天津私营染织厂中打轴、打穗女工工作了二、三年甚至十多年以上，仍被资方叫做临时工。工资低，没有福利待遇，休假期不发工资，资本家还可以任意解雇、停工。北京新声药厂有三十多名女工，资本家为了不让她们从临时工转为长工，每当女工将要做满三个月的工作时，就欺骗女工说没有活了，叫女工回家；另外再找一批女工来工作。这样轮流倒换，有的女工在这个工厂做了好几年工了，也当不了长工。哈尔滨市道外丰年糖果工厂的资本家张汉臣，强迫女工加班加点，谁要不愿加就要解雇谁。
    同工不同酬
    资产阶级为了贪图暴利、破坏工人阶级内部的团结，故意违犯政府法令，采用同工不同酬的办法对待女工。资本家巧立名目，把女工叫做临时工、外工、日计工、短工等，以降低工资，残酷地榨取女工血汗，剥夺女工的福利待遇。如天津协丰化学厂把男工算作长工，每月平均工资为二百七十斤玉米面，年底每人发四个月工资的奖金；把女工算作临时工，每月平均工资为二百斤玉米面，根本不发奖金。西安市私营中南火柴公司九十五个女工都以外工论，完全享受不到住房、水、电、理发、洗澡等一切待遇。工厂裁人时，给男工发两个月遣散费，女工则一文不给。苏南正泰丝厂男女绞丝工的工作能力相同，男工是月给制，平均月薪为四十八点八个折实单位，供给膳宿；女工是日给制，平均每月工资只合三十九个折实单位，而且不供膳宿。太原各私营厂的女工，不但工资比男工低，连计算工资米价的标准也不一致。男工按九百三十元的米价折算，女工只按八百五十元折算。济南市有的私营烟厂，一九五○年时，做同样工作的男女工人，工资竟相差三倍。
    限制女工婚姻自由
    中华人民共和国婚姻法规定实行男女婚姻自由，可是，损人利己的资本家，恐怕女工生了小孩影响工作，便不惜破坏女工的一生幸福，不准女工结婚。福建泉州永惠医院（私人开办）有些女工进院十年，现已三十岁了，资方始终不准结婚，谁要结婚就开除谁。北京余蓝记糖果工厂的资本家，去年把四个已经结了婚的女工一齐解雇（工会提出抗议，资本家没有达到解雇目的），并且分化工人说：“厂内工作少，去掉几个人，你们可以多干一些日子。”违法资本家就是这样利用饥饿和失业的恐吓，来剥夺女工的婚姻自由。
    侮辱女工
    荒淫无耻、腐化堕落的资产阶级，从来就是把自己的快乐建筑在别人的痛苦上。资本家对于新社会的妇女权利是丝毫不尊重的。他们对于工厂、商店里的女工、女职员，随意加以兽性的侮辱。济南市中华农具社近六十岁的资本家杨子明和他的两个儿子，曾先后强奸女职员某某十一次。北京市第八区九丰织布厂在这次反盗窃运动中，才知道好几个女工被经理强奸过。抚顺市奸商李国仁强奸一个十七岁和一个十六岁的女工。有的野蛮成性的商人，强迫女工出卖肉体，替他拉生意。青岛久惠堂饭馆的女店员张美蓝，在青岛食品业店员大会上控诉资方说：“我们凭自己的劳力挣钱吃饭，可是经理硬逼我出卖肉体来给他拉生意。当我赶走了那个侮辱我的流氓以后，经理就瞪起眼睛叫我离开饭馆。”有的私营工厂还存在着搜身制。北京余蓝记糖果工厂工人下了工，资本家的老婆就来搜查女工，连女工的裤腰带上的结子也要摸一摸，才叫出厂。
    剥夺女工的政治权利
    解放以后，一切男女工人都有申请参加和组织工会的自由，可是，资本家害怕工人团结，害怕工人觉悟提高。因此，他们不惜违犯国家法令，千方百计地阻止女工参加工会和一切政治活动。福州西门一家私人手工业毛巾厂，雇了四个女工在楼上织毛巾，不准她们下楼活动，不准她们参加工会组织。沈阳市南市区远东皮带卡子厂几个女工，一九五一年参加了工会，资方就要解雇她们，工会不同意，资方就以关门不干来威胁。天津市天利成地毯工厂资本家，竟威胁参加了工会的女工说：“你们入工会吧，早晚有后悔的一天。”并且辱骂女工说：“入工会的简直是疯子！”去年昆明市北区染织业女工参加“三八”国际劳动妇女节游行回来，曾挨了资方的打。
    欺骗女工、离间女工和政府的关系
    损人利己的资本家，对于女工的福利待遇，是从不过问的。他们甚至故意曲解政府法令，欺骗女工。譬如劳动保险条例颁布后，很多资本家不执行。北京大陆装订所过去一直把切下纸边卖的钱归工人分。劳动保险条例颁布后，资本家欺骗女工说：“产假期间工资要从纸边里出。”他征求女工意见说：“你们愿意要产假工资；还是要纸边钱。”结果未婚女工要纸边钱，已婚女工要产假工资。资本家利用这个机会分化女工团结，决定给女工分纸边钱，不给产假工资，来拉拢多数未婚女工。武汉宇宙烟厂资本家为了离间女工和人民政府的关系，故意把女工工资提高一些，举办几件福利事业，来拉拢工人，模糊工人的阶级意识；然后又在女工面前哭穷说：“政府税重啦！工厂要赔啦！”想欺骗女工替他向政府请求减税。
