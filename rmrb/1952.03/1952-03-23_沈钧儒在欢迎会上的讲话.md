Comrades, Representatives of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers:

    On behalf of the Preparatory Committee of the China Political Science and Law Society, and as the Vice-President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, I am very honored to welcome you. In order to investigate the atrocities of the American aggressors, you have traveled a difficult and arduous road in Korea, obtained conclusive evidence, and fulfilled the mission entrusted to you by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and have come to our capital, China. Your spirit of hard struggle for world peace and human security, and the achievements you have made, are worthy of respect and gratitude from the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world. On behalf of the common will of Chinese legal workers, I would like to express my highest respect to you.

    When you were conducting investigations in Korea, it was precisely when the American aggressors were continuously carrying out the most insane, most shameless, most savage, and most brutal germ warfare in Korea. At this very moment, the American imperialists expanded the germ warfare to China, using military aircraft to continuously violate our Chinese Northeast airspace and spreading large quantities of insects carrying bacteria. Following this, they committed the same crimes in the suburbs of Qingdao City and nearby areas in Shandong Province, China. These crimes have aroused unparalleled anger and unanimous condemnation from the people of Korea, China, and all peace-loving people in the world.

    The war of aggression waged by American imperialism against Korea has exposed its extremely cruel nature from the very beginning. All kinds of atrocities have been clearly investigated by you. Now that American imperialism has reached a dead end, it has actually carried out large-scale germ warfare, which Hitler and the Japanese militarists did not dare to carry out. This is a new exposure of the aggressive brutality of American imperialism and the beginning of a new threat to all the people of the world. The cruel effect of bacteriological weapons is incomparable to that of ordinary weapons. Its purpose is not only to destroy military forces, but especially to massacre ordinary peaceful residents. American soldiers have even said such shameless words that if all the people are infected and die, all factories and houses will fall into the hands of the victors without any damage. Therefore, the new attempt that American imperialism is now undertaking is a serious threat to all mankind. We, all peace-loving people in the world, must unite and vigorously stop this heinous crime so that they will never dare to commit it again. Your investigation in Korea and the impact of the investigation results will be an important factor in stopping this crime. Your upcoming trip from Beijing to our Northeast for investigation will contribute even more to stopping this crime.

    We legal workers have an even greater responsibility to severely condemn the crimes of American imperialism that completely violate human morality and international law. The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 have long prohibited the use of poisonous weapons, and the Geneva Protocol of 1925 further stipulates that the use of bacteriological weapons is an illegal crime. The United States, like Japan, refused to ratify the Geneva Protocol, which has clearly indicated its deliberate conspiracy to use bacteriological weapons, but it does not in the least reduce its guilt for violating international law. The American aggressors who use bacteriological weapons should all be convicted as war criminals.

    Today, as we welcome you from Korea to China and then on to the Northeast for investigation, I, on behalf of the legal workers and people's organizations present today, wish you the completion of your great mission, wish you good health, and wish the people of the world victory in defending peace and stopping American aggression.

    沈钧儒在欢迎会上的讲话
    国际民主法律工作者协会诸位代表先生：
    我代表中国政治法律学会筹备会，并以国际民主法律工作者协会副主席的资格，很荣幸地欢迎你们。你们为了调查美国侵略者的暴行，在朝鲜经历了艰难辛苦的长途跋踄，得到了确凿的证据，执行了国际民主法律工作者协会所赋与你们的使命，来到了我们中国的首都。你们这种为世界和平与人类安全而坚苦奋斗的精神和奋斗所得的成就，是值得为我们中国人民和世界一切爱好和平的人民所崇敬和感谢的。我谨代表中国法律工作者的共同意旨，向你们表示最崇高的敬意。
    你们在朝鲜进行调查的时候，正是美国侵略者在朝鲜连续进行最疯狂、最无耻、最野蛮、最残暴的细菌战的时候。正在这个时候，美帝国主义者又把细菌战扩大到了中国，用军用飞机连续侵犯我们中国东北领空，大量撒布带有细菌的昆虫。跟着，又在我们中国山东的青岛市郊和附近一带地方犯下了同样的罪行。这种罪行已经激起了朝鲜、中国和全世界一切爱好和平人民无比的愤怒和一致的声讨。
    美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的战争，自始就暴露了它的极其残酷的性质。种种暴行已经被你们调查清楚。美帝国主义到了现在走头无路的时候，竟实行希特勒和日本军阀所未敢进行的大规模的细菌战。这是美帝国主义侵略残暴性的一个新的暴露，是对全世界人民一个新威胁的开始。细菌武器的残暴作用与一般武器不可比拟，其使用的目的不仅是摧毁军事力量，而尤其是在屠杀一般和平居民。美国的军人竟会说出这样恬不知耻的话来，他说，如果人都染病死了，一切工厂和房子就都会毫不损坏地落到战胜者的手里。所以，美帝国主义现在所进行的新的尝试，是对全人类的一个严重威胁。我们全世界爱好和平的人民必须一致起来大力制止这一种滔天罪行，使他们从此不敢再犯。你们在朝鲜的调查和调查结果所将发生的影响，就是制止这种罪行的
    一个重要的因素。你们即将由北京前往我国东北调查，这将对于制止这种罪行，有更多的贡献。
    我们法律工作者对于美帝国主义这种完全违反人类道德和国际公法的罪行，更有严厉声讨的责任。一八九九年和一九○七年的海牙公约早已禁止使用有毒武器，一九二五年的日内瓦议定书更规定了使用细菌武器是违法的罪行。美国与日本一样，拒绝批准日内瓦议定书，这早已明显地表示了它蓄意使用细菌武器的阴谋，但并不能丝毫减少其违反国际公法的罪责。美国使用细菌武器的侵略罪犯，是都应当作为战争罪犯论罪的。
    今天，当我们欢迎你们从朝鲜来中国并接着就要前往东北调查的时候，我代表今天到会的法律工作者和各人民团体，祝你们伟大任务的完成，祝你们的健康，并祝全世界人民保卫和平、制止美国侵略的胜利。
