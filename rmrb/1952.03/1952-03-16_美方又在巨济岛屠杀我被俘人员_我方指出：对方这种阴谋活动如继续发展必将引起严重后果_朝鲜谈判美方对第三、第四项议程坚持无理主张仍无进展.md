Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th – The bloody traces of the savage massacre of our captured personnel by the other side in the Geoje Island POW camp on February 18th had not yet dried, and on March 13th, less than a month since the last incident, our captured personnel suffered another massacre in the other side's Geoje Island POW camp. According to the other side's official acknowledgement to our side, twelve of our captured personnel died and twenty-six were injured. On the March 15th Fourth Agenda Subcommittee meeting, the other side used a nonchalant tone to "notify" our side of this event. Our representative solemnly pointed out that this was yet another bloody incident of the other side illegally massacring our captured personnel under their custody, and our side reserves all rights to make demands regarding this incident. Our representative further pointed out that if the other side's various conspiracy activities against our captured personnel, which are closely related to this bloody massacre, continue to develop, they will inevitably lead to serious consequences. Our representative particularly pointed out that the Kuomintang bandit gang's Central News Agency Geoje Island dispatch on March 14th revealed the other side's conspiracy to collude with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, publicly announcing to the world the extreme seriousness of the conspiracy activities being carried out among our captured personnel.

Since the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee resumed at the other side's proposal, due to the other side's persistence in its unreasonable demands, disregard for our side's reasonable suggestions, and unwillingness to resolve the problem, there has been no progress after sixteen days of resumption. Now the other side has proposed that the issues that the subcommittee has so far failed to resolve be handed over to the staff officers' meeting for discussion and to seek a solution. In response, our representative pointed out that the best way is for both sides to reach a principled agreement on the full release and repatriation of all POWs held by both sides in the subcommittee, based on the materials that have already been exchanged, and then hand it over to the staff officers to gradually negotiate and resolve the unresolved issues based on the agreed principles. However, as long as both sides have the sincerity to resolve the problem, the method and procedure of negotiation should not become a matter of contention. Since the other side believes that the staff officers' meeting format is more appropriate, our side agrees to the other side's suggestion. Both sides agreed that the staff officers' meeting will be held at 11:00 AM tomorrow.

At the Third Agenda staff officers' meeting, the other side, on the one hand, claimed to advocate resolving all outstanding issues other than the issue of neutral nation nominations simultaneously, but on the other hand, refused to put forward any specific proposals. Our side reiterated that our side had already put forward a reasonable compromise proposal on the issues of rotation and ports on February 23rd, and it is impossible to ask our side to make unilateral concessions again. The so-called issue of "troop deployment and concentration" fabricated out of thin air in the other side's draft armistice agreement must be removed from the draft. Currently, on the Third Agenda staff officers' meeting, the four issues other than the issue of neutral nation nominations, namely the issues of rotation and ports, the issue of the powers of the neutral nation inspection teams, the issue of the deployment and concentration of troops of both sides fabricated by the other side, and the issue of whether the words "of Korea" should be added to Article 2, Paragraph 15 of the draft agreement, whether these four issues can be resolved together depends entirely on whether the other side still insists on its one-sided demands regarding ports and its completely unreasonable demands regarding troop deployment and concentration.

    美方又在巨济岛屠杀我被俘人员
    我方指出：对方这种阴谋活动如继续发展必将引起严重后果
    朝鲜谈判美方对第三、第四项议程坚持无理主张仍无进展
    【新华社开城十五日电】二月十八日对方在巨济岛战俘营内，野蛮地屠杀我方被俘人员的血迹未干，三月十三日，距离上次的事件还不到一个月，我方被俘人员又在对方的巨济岛战俘营内，遭受到另一次的屠杀。据对方向我方正式承认的，我方被俘人员死十二人，伤二十六人。在三月十五日第四项议程小组委员会上，对方以轻描淡写的语气将这事件“通知”我方。我方代表严正指出这是对方非法屠杀在其收容下的我方被俘人员的又一血腥事件，我方保留对此事件的一切要求权利。我方代表并进一步指出与这种血腥屠杀有密切关系的对方对我方被俘人员的种种阴谋活动如果继续发展下去，将必然引起严重后果。我方代表特别指出三月十四日国民党匪帮中央社巨济岛电讯，透露对方勾结台湾蒋介石匪帮的阴谋，公开向全世界宣布了正在我方被俘人员中进行着的阴谋活动的极端严重性。
    第四项议程小组委员会经对方提议复会以来，由于对方坚持其无理主张，不顾我方合理建议，不愿解决问题，以致复会了十六天仍然毫无进展。现在对方又提议将小组委员会迄今所未能获得解决的问题再交给参谋会议去讨论，并寻求解决。对此，我方代表指出最好的办法是双方在小组委员会上，以现已交换的材料为基础，达成全部释放和遣返双方所收容的战俘的原则协议，然后交由参谋人员根据已协议的原则，将未解决的问题逐步协商解决，但只要双方都具有解决问题的诚意，协商的方式与程序不应成为一个争执的问题。既然对方认为参谋会议的形式更为合适一些，我方同意对方的建议。双方同意参谋会议明早十一时开会。
    第三项议程参谋会议上，对方一方面声称主张将中立国提名问题以外的其他各项未决问题同时解决，另一方面却又拒绝提出任何具体方案。我方再次声明我方在轮换与口岸问题上早在二月二十三日就提出了合理的折衷方案，决不可能再要求我方作单方面的让步。对方所提出的停战协定草案中无中生有的所谓“部队部署与集中”的问题更必须自草案中取消。目前第三项议程参谋会议上，中立国提名问题以外的四个问题，即轮换与口岸问题、中立国视察小组权力问题、对方一手制造的有关双方部队的部署与集中问题及应否在协定草案第二条第十五款中加入“朝鲜的”字样问题，此四问题能否一并解决，全视对方仍否坚持其关于口岸的片面主张，及关于部队部署与集中的完全无理的要求。
