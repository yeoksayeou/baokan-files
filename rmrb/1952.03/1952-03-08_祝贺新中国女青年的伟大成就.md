Congratulating the Great Achievements of Young Women in New China
    Wen Cailin, Yang Yadi, Qi Mijia, Shi Duan Guo Mali, Mei Weijia, Jiang Dongni, Sa Anna
    Editor's Note: There are thirty-three Eastern European students studying at Tsinghua University. They came to China to study between the winter of 1950 and August 1951. This is an article written by eight of them, female students, to commemorate International Women's Day on March 8th.
    We are eight female students from Eastern European People's Democratic countries who have come to China to study. We feel very fortunate to have the opportunity to come to the great New China led by Comrade Mao Zedong to study the glorious struggle history and long-standing culture of the brave and hardworking Chinese people. In a short period of time, we have seen the vigorous development of New China's construction and how the Chinese people and youth are carrying out the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea with a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. We also learned about the lives of women in New China, as well as the names and deeds of female heroes who sacrificed heroically in the Liberation War, such as Liu Hulan, and Tian Guiying, the first female train driver in New China.
    Women in our countries, like women in New China, live and work happily and proudly. Our country's constitution guarantees that women enjoy equal rights with men in all situations and stipulates that our women have the right to education, pensions, and rest. In order to take care of mothers and children, the government has established many maternity hospitals, nurseries, and kindergartens. Pregnant women have sufficient time off before and after childbirth, and their wages are paid as usual during the leave period, and they can enjoy free medical care and nursing.
    In the great cause of defending and building the motherland, women, under the leadership of the Party and the government, have contributed their lives and strength like men, and have made indelible achievements. For example, Ana Pauker of Romania, who is now a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Romania. She has experienced arduous revolutionary struggles and was arrested and imprisoned by fascist bandits. Tsola Dragoycheva of Bulgaria is a member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Minister of Post and Telegraph of the government. She has always stood at the forefront of the anti-fascist struggle and was sentenced to death by the past reactionary government. Andi of Hungary? is one of Hungary's most outstanding historians. The name of the famous young female hero Lyubka Dimitrova of Bulgaria is also respected. In the anti-fascist war, she fought alone with the fascist police who besieged her for twelve hours. She saved the last bullet for herself and heroically dedicated her life to the motherland. These female revolutionaries are our best role models. They dedicate all their talents and energy to their cause. Women in factories and rural areas also work selflessly like all the people. Many female Stakhanovite workers have completed arduous production tasks with a high degree of creativity. Zychlinska of Poland completed her six-year production plan in two years. A female worker, Vackova, in Czechoslovakia manages sixty textile machines by herself. Many female factory workers and women in rural areas have honorably received the titles of "Bonus" and "Labor Hero" awarded by the government.
    Women in our Eastern European People's Democratic countries also clearly understand that every bit of our labor is for the construction of our new country—advancing towards socialism, and for consolidating and strengthening the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. We believe that our strength is incomparably powerful. We have the Soviet people under the leadership of Stalin and the Chinese people under the leadership of Mao Zedong standing with us. The conspiracy of the aggressive group headed by U.S. imperialism to undermine peace must be crushed. On the occasion of commemorating this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day, I would like to congratulate the achievements of women in New China and young women in New China, and may we work together for lasting world peace in the future.

    祝贺新中国女青年的伟大成就

    编者按：在清华大学学习的东欧留学生共有三十三人，他们是在一九五○年冬天到一九五一年八月间先后来我国学习的。这是他们当中的八个女同学为纪念“三八”国际妇女节所写的文章。
    我们是东欧人民民主国家到中国来学习的八个女同学。我们感到非常幸福，能有机会来到伟大的毛泽东同志所领导的新中国，学习勇敢而勤劳的中国人民光辉斗争的历史和悠久的文化。在短短的日子里，我们看到了新中国建设事业的蓬勃发展以及中国人民和青年怎样以高度的爱国主义、国际主义精神进行伟大的抗美援朝的斗争，知道了新中国妇女的生活情况，也知道在解放战争中壮烈牺牲的女英雄刘胡兰、新中国第一个女火车司机田桂英等英雄的名字和事迹。
    我们国家里的妇女也和新中国的妇女一样，幸福而骄傲地生活着、劳动着。我们国家的宪法上保证妇女们在任何场合下和男人们一样平等地享受各种权利，并规定我们妇女有受教育、领养老金、休息等权利。政府为了照顾母亲和孩子，普遍设立了许多助产医院、托儿所、幼稚园，产妇在产前产后都有足够的休假时间，休假期间的工资也照样发给，并且可以享受免费的医药和护理。
    在保卫祖国建设祖国的伟大事业中，妇女们在党和政府领导下和男人们一样地贡献了自己的生命和力量，有着不可磨灭的功绩。例如罗马尼亚的安娜·波克，她现在担任罗马尼亚工人党中央政治局委员和罗马尼亚外交部部长的重要职务。她经历过艰苦的革命斗争，曾被法西斯强盗逮捕入狱。保加利亚的婥娜·德拉哥伊切娃是保加利亚共产党中央委员和政府的邮电部部长，她始终站在反法西斯斗争的最前线，并曾被过去的反动政府判处过死刑。匈牙利的安迪?是匈牙利最杰出的历史学家之一。保加利亚有名的青年女英雄李良娜·季米特洛夫的名字也受人尊敬，在反法西斯战争中，她一人单独地和围攻她的法西斯警察作战十二小时，她把最后一颗子弹留给了自己，壮烈地为祖国献出了生命。这些女革命家是我们最好的榜样，她们把自己所有的才能和精力献给自己的事业。在工厂和农村中的妇女也和所有的人民一样忘我地劳动着，许多女斯达哈诺夫工作者以高度的创造精神，出色地完成了艰巨的生产任务。波兰的齐克林斯珈在二年内完成了她六年的生产计划。捷克的一个女工伐茨克娃一个人就管理了六十台纺织机器。很多的工厂女工和农村中的妇女都光荣地获得了政府颁发的“奖金”和“劳动英雄”的称号。
    我们东欧人民民主国家的妇女还清楚懂得我们一点一滴的劳动，都是为着建设我们的新国家——向社会主义前进，为着巩固和加强着以苏联为首的和平阵营。我们相信我们的力量是强大无比的，我们有斯大林领导下的苏联人民和毛泽东领导下的中国人民和我们站在一起，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团破坏和平的阴谋一定要被粉碎。当着纪念今年的“三八”国际妇女节的时候，谨祝贺新中国妇女、新中国女青年的成就，愿我们今后一起为世界持久和平而奋斗。    （祁密珈执笔）
