Xinhua News Agency, dated 6th from Moscow: The Soviet people commemorated the 100th anniversary of the death of the great Russian writer Gogol on March 4th. The Moscow commemorative meeting was held at the Moscow Grand Theater. Attending the meeting were more than two thousand people, including representatives of the working people of Moscow, famous leaders of cultural and scientific circles, foreign guests, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union.

	The theater hall was solemnly decorated. Gogol's portrait, surrounded by flowers, was hung high on the stage, flanked by the large golden characters: "1852-1952."

	The famous Soviet writer and critic Yermilov delivered a report on Gogol's life and works at the meeting. He emphasized that Gogol extremely hated enslavement, and his works were filled with strong feelings against selfishness. Gogol's immortal contribution to mankind lies in the fact that he was the first in the history of world literature to expose the sinful nature of dead souls ruling over living people with such magnificent power, profoundness, and complete artistic form. Yermilov said: Today, the attempts of Mr. Bigwigs, who have no conscience but only money bags, to forcibly impose the kingdom of dead souls – the "new order" of the American brand, the graveyard - on the heads of people of all countries will never succeed. The living soul of mankind is immortal, and it is embodied in the genius of Stalin—the genius of international friendship and peace.

	The representative of the Soviet Writers Association, Babayevsky, the representative of the Ukrainian Writers Association, Korneichuk, and the Soviet People's Actress Gogoleva, successively delivered speeches at the meeting, paying tribute to the talented Russian writer Gogol.

	The attendees also warmly welcomed the speeches of foreign guests, namely: Turkish poet Hikmet (representing the World Peace Council), French poet Éluard, Polish writer Kruczkowski, Korean writer Lee Ki-young, Chinese writer Ding Ling, Mongolian writer Ts. Damdinsüren, as well as representatives from the cultural and scientific circles of Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Their speeches unanimously pointed out that the commemoration of Gogol by the people of all countries will further strengthen the friendly unity of peace-loving people around the world and promote new victories in the great cause of world peace.

	After the meeting, a grand performance was held, featuring Gogol's famous plays and operas adapted from his works.

	On the same day, cultural palaces, clubs, enterprises, institutions, and schools in various parts of the Soviet Union held commemorative lectures, reports, seminars, exhibitions, and literary evenings. Many theaters staged Gogol's plays. The Gogol Monument erected on Gogol Street in Moscow was solemnly unveiled on the 2nd.

	Xinhua News Agency, dated 6th: The working people of people's democratic countries solemnly commemorated the centenary of Gogol's death anniversary. The German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Albania, and other countries held grand commemorative meetings on the 3rd and 4th respectively. The commemorative meeting in Berlin was held at the Friedrichstadt-Palast, attended by President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic, Chairman Dieckmann of the People's Chamber, Deputy Prime Minister Nuschke, and others.
