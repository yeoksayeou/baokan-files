    (X) When Martyr Luo Shengjiao was buried, the villagers once again gathered around the grave, paying their last respects to their loved one. Everyone cried bitterly, burying the martyr with a shovel of soil and a tear. The rescued boy, Cui Yong, swore an oath at the martyr's grave, resolving to join the Korean People's Army and fight the American invaders alongside the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    (XI) To commemorate Martyr Luo Shengjiao, the villagers resolved to guarantee early payment of public grain, to cultivate diligently in the future, produce more grain to support the front lines, and strive for greater victories in the anti-aggression war.
    (XII) When the heroic deeds of the immortal internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, who sacrificed himself to save the drowning Korean boy Cui Yong, spread to the various units of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, the soldiers all resolved to learn from Luo Shengjiao's great internationalist spirit and the noble qualities of a revolutionary soldier in battle. And they swore to resolutely defeat the American invaders, avenge the Korean people and their sacrificed comrades. (The End)
