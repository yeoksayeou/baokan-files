    Preliminary Self-Criticism of My Pro-British and Pro-American Ideologies
    Chen Shutao, Professor of Civil Engineering, Northwest Institute of Technology

    I examine my pro-British and pro-American ideologies with a heavy heart. This examination is still preliminary. Here, I will take the erroneous matter of publishing my paper in Britain as an example.

    Before liberation, the Chinese scientific community was severely influenced by British and American bourgeois thought. Some Chinese scientists had studied in Britain and the United States, admired the material civilization of Britain and the United States, and blindly and uncritically brought the British and American system to China. “The moon is rounder in foreign countries” was the ideological portrayal of scientists who worshiped Britain and the United States at that time. Some, although they had not studied in Britain and the United States, read British and American books and were exposed to people who had been to Britain and the United States and praised Britain and the United States. They could ramble on about the Golden Gate Bridge, New York's skyscrapers, and the Boulder Dam, but knew nothing about the scientific achievements of the Chinese working people. The former were in the minority, the latter in the majority, but the degree of erosion by British and American bourgeois thought was the same for both. As a result, they took pride in being able to speak English, read English books, and manipulate British and American science and technology. The old China was an unaltered replica of the British and American system. And I grew up in such an environment, and naturally contracted a strong pro-British and pro-American bourgeois ideology.

    My father was a Xiucai in the late Qing Dynasty, and his passing the Xiucai exam was sudden, which had a great impact on my work attitude. Without my grandfather's consent, he secretly ran to the prefectural city more than a hundred miles away from home to take the exam. At first, he was afraid that my grandfather would ridicule him for not passing the exam, so he concealed it from his grandfather, but he unexpectedly passed. My mother often told me about this. Therefore, in my mind, there is the idea of "not crying out until one has already soared," or "a dark horse suddenly appears." In other words, it is the idea of climbing upwards. Some people like money, some people hope for status, but what I hope for are works of creation, although the way of climbing upwards is different, the purpose of climbing upwards is the same. Because of this upward-climbing consciousness, combined with the general situation of the Chinese scientific community before liberation, I was more deeply eroded by British and American bourgeois thought.

    In the old society, those scientists who worshiped Britain and the United States were willing to submit their papers to the world's "most authoritative" magazines for publication, hoping that the world's "largest number" of people would appreciate them. Whether the country to which they submitted their papers was their friend or their enemy was not taken into consideration. The so-called science is international, the so-called science has no national boundaries, is the only excuse for scientists to deny that they do not love their country. He did not know that science must also serve politics, technology must be combined with politics, and scientists must have a clear class stand. The seeds of scientific creation were sown in countries under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and when they blossomed and bore fruit, people all over the world suffered. He thought that the British and American scientific institutions were purely scientific research institutions, but he did not know that behind every scientific institution, there were British and American capitalists manipulating them. Scientifically speaking, China in the past was relatively backward. Because I wanted my papers to be appreciated by the "largest number" of people, I sent them to Britain one after another, and unconsciously fell into the trap of British and American bourgeois machinations.

    From 1940 to September 1951, I continued to send papers to Britain. Some were published, some were returned, and some have not been heard from until now. In terms of time, it is not too long, and in terms of frequency, it is not too much, but the mistakes I have made may be more serious than those of the same kind. First, I have never submitted a manuscript to domestic scientific publications, whether before or after liberation, let alone published one. Second, after liberation, the people of the whole country have already achieved great victories. Under the circumstance that the political consciousness of the people of the whole country has been unprecedentedly improved, I still continue to do this kind of wrong deed, and have published more than two papers in Britain (according to what I know now). These two points fully demonstrate my loss of national self-confidence and my slavish ideology of serving British and American bourgeoisie.

    I once said: the old Chinese scientific community was severely influenced by British and American bourgeois ideology. Chinese scientists publish papers in Britain and the United States, and the people around them do not consider it a great shame, but instead think it is remarkable; instead of preventing him, persuading him, and reversing him by various methods, they intentionally or unintentionally promote him. Students are proud to have such a teacher, and schools are proud to have such a professor. I published my paper in Britain, and I benefited a lot in terms of "reputation" and "practical benefits". I used to think that if I didn't have these papers, maybe I wouldn't have been able to climb to this position. But I didn't know that this position had already sacrificed the blood and sweat of many working people and lost the dignity of the people's motherland!

    Right and wrong will eventually be determined, and mistakes will eventually be discovered. In the new China after liberation, the general public's view of Britain and the United States has undergone a fundamental change, and I have also changed under the influence of the outside world. Once I saw the educational leading organ criticizing Zhongyuan University for blindly praising a certain reactionary foreign newspaper, my heart began to fluctuate, but this fluctuation subsided quickly. I still covered up for myself and defended myself, and I still isolated politics and science.

    "Foreign reactionary newspapers are political, foreign scientific publications are scientific, and the two cannot be equated," I thought wrongly. The second time, a comrade delivering a letter handed me a letter from Britain, and said to my face: "This is a letter from British imperialism." His simple words heavily struck my heartstrings. I felt very uncomfortable. As a people's teacher, a university professor, I have been respected and loved by the people of the motherland since liberation, but I am still colluding with British imperialism. Later, the Beijing People's Daily and Guangming Daily successively published several professors' self-criticisms, which also often mentioned this issue, which deeply educated me. Finally, in the ideological remolding movement of faculty and staff in Northwest China's universities and colleges, I listened to the mobilization report of the head, which moved me even more. My thoughts have been constantly struggling. Every time I go through a struggle, I criticize a part of the error, so that I can make a preliminary self-criticism today.

    Scientific works are the crystallization of all working people, not the achievements of scientists alone. If scientists are separated from the surrounding things and the surrounding masses, they will never be able to achieve anything. But I unconditionally sold this property of all working people to Britain. I was not ashamed but proud. And this group of enemies are helping the United States on the Korean battlefield, massacring peaceful people. But I called them "dear gentlemen" in the letter, and signed myself as "faithful friends", what does this mean? How much blood and sweat of the working people was spent to train me to become a university professor, but I wholeheartedly serve the British bourgeoisie, what does this mean? The working people of the motherland planted trees themselves, irrigating and weeding every day. Today it grows a little, tomorrow it grows an inch. It finally has branches, leaves, flowers, and bears fruit. But I give the hard-earned fruits to the British and American bourgeoisie. Is this what the people of the motherland expect of me?

    Generally speaking, sending papers to Britain is to increase the enemy's ambition and destroy one's own prestige. The British bourgeoisie can use this to deceive the working people they oppress: "Although the Chinese mainland has been completely liberated, Chinese scientists are still our faithful friends." This easily blurs the British working people's vision of the new China. Not only that, this kind of wrong action, to a certain extent, directly hinders the progress of the motherland's science and endangers the development of the motherland's economic construction. Please ask: If our scientists are all like me, and do not trust their own scientific publications, how much damage will the motherland's science suffer? How many difficulties will the economic construction of the motherland encounter? The content and status of scientific publications in the old China are closely related to the Chinese scientists' submission of papers to foreign countries, and they are mutually causal. Chinese scientists do not believe in their own publications, and send their papers to foreign countries. If they can be published in foreign countries, they will be flattered. Otherwise, they have to seek the "next best thing" and submit them to Chinese publications. This fully demonstrates the serious impact of imperialist cultural aggression on our scientific community. Isn't British and American bourgeois ideology hateful? Due to the influence of British and American bourgeois ideology, scientific publications in the old China became appendages, without content and without status. Sometimes, they simply could not receive suitable manuscripts. Therefore, Chinese scientists with strong bourgeois consciousness looked down on their own publications even more. This mutual influence hindered the development of Chinese science. Now, if we want to develop the science of the motherland and shoulder the task of the motherland's economic construction, we must first draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy, and thoroughly criticize the ideological consciousness of the British and American bourgeoisie. As a people's teacher, I am loved by the students and friends around me, but I have been infected with the British and American bourgeois ideology, worship the "material civilization" of Britain and the United States, and praise the "science and technology" of Britain and the United States. This kind of wrong ideological action has influenced my friends and students, and has been spread by my friends and students to their friends and students. As for using our works directly in war to massacre our people, it is even more unthinkable.

    Scientists of the new China, like the people of the whole country, love their motherland and truth. When we recognize the poisonous harm of the so-called supra-class bourgeois ideology, we should boldly and bravely admit our mistakes and resolutely transform ourselves with proletarian ideology. I hate the past mistakes and guarantee that I will never make them again in the future, but it is not enough to just hate them. We must provide guarantees with actions: First, I am not yet forty years old this year, and it has only been more than ten years since I started working. In these ten years, under the control of British and American bourgeois ideology, I wrongly helped our enemies. I sincerely guarantee that I will make greater efforts in the future to create more things under the care of my own country's people. Second, bourgeois science is separated from theory and practice. In the past, I studied suspension bridges and wind force on high roofs, etc., but I did not ask whether the motherland needed these things at present. I guarantee that theory must be combined with practice to serve the current economic construction of the motherland. Third, science must be combined with politics, scientists must recognize that science serves politics, and scientists must have a clear class stand. This is what I have deeply realized in this review. Therefore, I will definitely strengthen political study, eliminate the toxins added to my thoughts by domestic and foreign bourgeoisie, and overcome my purely technical viewpoints and the reactionary viewpoints that science has no national boundaries.

    初步检讨我的崇拜英美的思想
    西北工学院土木系教授  陈叔陶
    我以沉痛的心情，来检讨我的崇拜英美的思想。这个检讨还是初步的。这里把我在英国发表论文这一件错误的事情作一个例子。
    解放前的中国科学界是受着英、美资产阶级思想的严重影响的。中国科学家，有的在英美留过学，羡慕英、美的物质文明，盲目地不加批判地把英、美的一套搬到中国来。“月亮是外国的圆”，就是当时崇拜英、美的科学家的思想写照。有的虽然没有在英、美留过学，但看的是英、美的书；接触的是到过英、美，和称赞英、美的人。他们能够把金门大桥，纽约的摩天大楼，鲍特高坝等胡凑一阵，而对于中国劳动人民的科学成就却一无所知。这两类人，前者是少数，后者是多数，但英、美资产阶级思想对于他们侵蚀的严重程度，却是一样的。于是他们以能说英国话，看英文书，和搬弄英、美的科学技术为荣。旧中国的一套，就是原封不动的英、美的一套。而我就在这么一个环境下生长起来的，自然也感染了浓厚的英、美资产阶级的思想。
    我父亲是前清的一个秀才，他的考中秀才是突然的，这对我的工作态度有很大的影响。他没有得到我祖父的同意，偷偷地跑到离家一百多里地的府城去投考。当初他怕我祖父讥笑他考不中，所以瞒着祖父，后来居然考中了，我母亲常常把这件事情告诉给我听。所以在我的头脑里，有“不鸣则已，一鸣惊人”的思想。换句话说，就是向上爬的思想。有的人喜欢金钱，有的人希望地位，而我所希望的，却是一篇篇的创作，虽然向上爬的方式不一样，向上爬的目的都是相同的。因为有这样向上爬的意识，结合解放前中国科学界的一般情况，使我更深地受了英、美资产阶级思想的侵蚀。
    在旧社会里，那些崇拜英、美的科学家，愿意把自己的论文投向世界上“最有权威”的杂志发表，希望世界上“最大多数”的人欣赏。他所投寄论文的国家，到底是自己的友人呢，还是敌人呢？是在所不计的。所谓科学是国际性的，所谓科学没有国家的界限的，就是科学家否认他是不爱祖国的唯一藉口。他不知道科学必然也必须为政治服务，技术必须和政治结合，科学家必须有明确的阶级立场。科学创作的种子投向资产阶级专政的国家，开了花结了果，全世界人民都遭了殃。他以为英、美的科学机关是纯粹研究科学的机构，而不知道个个科学机构的幕后，都有英、美资本家在操纵。从科学上讲，过去的中国，是比较落后的，我因为要让我的论文能被“最大多数”的人欣赏，所以一篇篇地寄往英国去，而不知不觉地却中了英、美资产阶级的毒计。
    从一九四零年起到一九五一年九月止，我曾经继续地把论文寄到英国去。有的发表了，有的退回了，有的到现在还没有消息。从时间上讲，并不算太长，从次数上讲并不算太多，可是我所犯的错误，却可能比同样的人更严重。第一、我在国内科学刊物上不论解放前后，从来没有投过一篇稿，更不必说发表了。第二、解放以后，全国人民业已取得伟大的胜利。在全国人民政治觉悟空前提高的情况下，我还继续不断地做这种错误的勾当，又在英国发表了两篇以上的论文（据我现在所知道的）。这两点充分地说明了我的丧失民族自信心，和为英、美资产阶级服务的奴化思想。
    我曾经说过：旧中国科学界，是受着英、美资产阶级的严重影响的。中国科学家在英、美发表论文，周围的人，不以为大耻辱，反以为了不起；不以种种的方法阻止他，说服他，和扭转他，反在有意或无意地去替他宣传捧场。学生中以有这样一个老师为荣，学校中以有这么一个教授为荣。我把论文发表在英国，无论在“名誉”上，在“实惠”上都沾了不少的光。我过去常常这样地想，假使我没有这几篇论文，也许还爬不到这个地位。而不知道这个地位已经是牺牲了多少劳动人民的血汗，丧失了多少人民祖国的尊严！
    是非最后终要确定的，错误最后终要发现的。解放后的新中国，一般人对英、美的看法发生了本质的变化，我在外界影响下也起了变化。有一次我看到教育领导机关批评中原大学盲目称赞外国某一个反动报纸的问题，我的心里就开始起了波动，但这个波动一下子就平复了。我还自己替自己掩饰，自己替自己辩护，我依旧把政治和科学孤立起来。
    “外国的反动报纸是政治性的，外国的科学刊物是科学性的，两者不能并论。”我错误地这样想着。第二次有一个送信的同志，递给我一封从英国寄来的信，当面还说了一句：“这是一封英帝国主义寄来的信。”他的简单的词句，沉重地撞击着我的心弦，我感到非常难受，我身为人民教师，大学教授，解放后受到祖国人民的尊敬和爱护，而我还在和英帝国主义勾勾搭搭。以后北京人民日报、光明日报连续发表了几位教授的检讨，也常常提到这个问题，这些都深深地教育了我。最后在西北区高等学校教职员思想改造运动中，听了首长的动员报告，更感动了我，我的思想就不断在斗争中，每经过一次斗争，就批判了一部分错误，使我能在今天作出初步的检讨。
    科学作品是全体劳动人民的结晶，不是科学家一人的成就，科学家如果脱离了周围的事物，周围的群众，是决不能有所成就的。而我却把这全体劳动人民的财产，无条件地出卖给英国。不以为耻，反以为荣。而这一批敌人，正在朝鲜战场上做美国的帮凶，屠杀和平人民。而我却在信上称他们为“亲爱的先生”，自己具名为“忠实的朋友”，这是什么意思？花了多少劳动人民的血汗，才把我培养成为一个大学教授，而我却忠心耿耿地为英国资产阶级服务，这又是什么意思？祖国劳动人民自己种了树，天天灌溉、锄草，今天长一分，明天长一寸，好容易有了枝叶，开了花，结了果。而我却把这辛苦得来的果实，送给英、美资产阶级，这难道是祖国人民对我的期望吗？
    一般地说，把论文寄到英国去，是长敌人的志气，灭自己的威风。英国资产阶级，可以借此欺骗被他们所压迫的劳动人民：“中国大陆上虽然已经全部解放了，但中国科学家，却仍然是咱们忠实的朋友。”这很容易模糊英国劳动人民对于新中国的视听。不仅如此，这一种错误的行动，在一定程度上直接阻碍祖国科学的进步，危害着祖国经济建设的发展。请问：如果我们的科学家都像我一样，不信任自己的科学刊物，祖国的科学会受到多大的损害？祖国经济建设会受到多少困难呢？旧中国科学刊物的内容与地位，和中国科学家向外国投寄论文的事情，休戚相关，互为因果。中国科学家不相信自己的刊物，把论文寄到外国去，万一能在外国发表，即受宠若惊，否则，才不得已而求其“次”，改投中国的刊物。这充分说明了帝国主义文化侵略对我们科学界发生的严重影响，英美资产阶级思想还不叫人痛恨切齿吗？由于英美资产阶级思想的影响，使旧中国科学刊物成了附属品，没有内容也没有地位，有的时候，根本就收不到合适的稿件。因此带有浓厚资产阶级意识的中国科学家就更看不起自己的刊物。这样互相影响，阻碍了中国科学的发展。现在，我们要发展祖国的科学，担负起祖国经济建设的任务，首先就必须划清敌我界限，彻底批判英美资产阶级的思想意识。我身为人民教师，我受着周围学生和朋友的爱戴，却染上了英美资产阶级思想，崇拜英、美的“物质文明”，称道英、美的
    “科学技术”，这一种错误的思想行动，影响了我的朋友和学生，更由我的朋友和学生，传播给他们的朋友和学生。至于利用我们的作品，直接用之于战争，屠杀我们的人民，是更不堪设想了。
    新中国的科学家是和全国人民一样，热爱自己的祖国和真理的。当我们认识了所谓超阶级的资产阶级思想的毒害，就应该大胆地勇敢地承认自己的错误，坚决地以无产阶级思想来改造自己。我痛恨已往的过失，保证今后决不再犯，但光是痛恨是不够的，我们必须以行动来提出保证：第一、我今年还不到四十岁，离开就业的时间，还不过十多年，这十多年中在英美资产阶级思想的支配下错误地帮助了我们的敌人。我诚恳地保证，今后要以更大的努力，在自己祖国人民的爱护下创作更多的东西。第二、资产阶级的科学是理论和实际脱离的，我过去研究吊桥以及高屋架的风力等，而眼前祖国是否需要这些，是不闻不问的。我保证理论必须和实际结合，为祖国目前经济建设而服务。第三、科学必须和政治结合，科学家必须认识科学为政治服务，科学家必须有明确的阶级立场，这是我在这次检讨中所深深体会到的。因此我一定加强政治学习，肃清国内外资产阶级加于我思想上的毒素，克服我的纯技术观点和科学是没有国家界限的反动观点。
