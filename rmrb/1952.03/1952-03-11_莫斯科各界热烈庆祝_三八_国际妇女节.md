Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th dispatch from TASS: Soviet women warmly celebrated "March 8th" International Women's Day. The Moscow celebration meeting was held at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, jointly hosted by representatives of the Moscow Party, Soviets, people's organizations, and the Soviet Army. Stakhanovite female workers, female engineers, female cultural and scientific workers, female heroes of socialist labor, and female deputies of the Supreme Soviet attended the meeting.

    The meeting was opened by Furtseva, Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). Mironova, Deputy Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet, delivered a report at the meeting. She said: Soviet women occupy a very important position in the victory of communist construction and in consolidating the economic strength of the Soviet Union and its international prestige. There are more than 2.5 million women in the Soviet Union working in scientific, educational, and cultural institutions. Approximately six hundred women have received Stalin Prizes for their outstanding achievements in scientific inventions, literature, and art. Soviet women also actively participate in the work of managing the country. There are two hundred and eighty female deputies in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, a number greater than the total number of female parliamentarians in all bourgeois countries combined. Mironova then discussed the important role played by women in the struggle for peace, freedom, and progress, and congratulated the women of the people's democracies and New China on their success in the struggle for the bright future of mankind. When Mironova mentioned the names of the female recipients of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize—Mrs. Gordon, Park Jung-ae, Soong Ching Ling, Mrs. Felton, and Anna Seghers—the attendees erupted in stormy cheers.

    The meeting concluded in a warm atmosphere with the adoption of a congratulatory telegram to Marshal Stalin.

    莫斯科各界热烈庆祝“三八”国际妇女节
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联妇女热烈庆祝了“三八”国际妇女节。莫斯科的庆祝大会在莫斯科大剧院举行，由莫斯科党、苏维埃、人民团体和苏军代表联合主持。参加大会的有斯塔哈诺夫式女工、女工程师、女文化和科学工作者，社会主义劳动女英雄和最高苏维埃女代表。
    大会由苏联共产党（布）莫斯科市委员会书记富尔西伐主持开幕。莫斯科市苏维埃副主席密罗诺娃在会上作了报告。她说：在共产主义建设的胜利中，在巩固苏联的经济力量及其国际威信中，苏联妇女们占有很重要的地位。苏联有二百五十多万妇女在科学、教育和文化机关中工作。约有六百名妇女由于在科学发明、文学和艺术方面的杰出成就，获得了斯大林奖金。苏联妇女还积极参加管理国家的工作。苏联最高苏维埃中有二百八十名女代表，这个数目比所有资产阶级国家议会中的女议员的总和还要多。密罗诺娃接着论述了妇女在争取和平、自由及进步的斗争中所起的重要作用，并祝贺人民民主国家和新中国的妇女在争取人类灿烂的将来的斗争中获得成功。当密罗诺娃提到“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金的女得奖人——戈登夫人、朴正爱、宋庆龄、费尔顿夫人和安娜·西格斯——的名字时，到会者发出了暴风雨般的欢呼声。
    大会最后在热烈气氛中通过了向斯大林大元帅致敬电。
