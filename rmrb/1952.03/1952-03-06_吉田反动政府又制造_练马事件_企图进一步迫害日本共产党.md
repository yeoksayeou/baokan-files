Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, Tokyo: The Japanese reactionary Yoshida government is constantly fabricating various incidents, attempting to use them as excuses for its shameless conspiracy to further persecute the Japanese Communist Party and patriotic workers. The recently occurred "Nerima Incident" is one example.

On December 26th of last year, near Nerima Station in Tokyo, a police officer named Indo, who was on duty, was suddenly assassinated. Despite the absence of any evidence whatsoever, the authorities have used this as an excuse to arrest five members of the union at the Odawara Paper Company's Tokyo factory (in Nerima Ward), including Tsurukichi Matsumoto and Ichiro Sunitta. They were immediately subjected to illegal interrogation. The interrogation focused on the union's activities and the relationship between the defendants and political parties, especially the relationship with the Communist Party. Obviously, the purpose of the Yoshida government is not only to falsely accuse these innocent defendants as the "murderers" of the police officer, but also to deliberately frame the Japanese Communist Party.

Although the interrogation failed to prove the "charges" fabricated by the Yoshida government, according to an Agence France-Presse report from Tokyo on the 19th, the police actually arrested five more union members on February 19th, two of whom are members of the Japanese Communist Party.

This persecution conspiracy by the reactionary Yoshida government has aroused the anger of the Japanese people. Unions and local residents alike believe this is a "second Matsukawa Incident" and have protested against it.

    吉田反动政府又制造“练马事件”
    企图进一步迫害日本共产党
    【新华社三日讯】东京消息：日本吉田反动政府不断制造各种事件，企图作为其进一步迫害日本共产党和爱国工人的无耻阴谋的藉口。最近发生的“练马事件”就是一个例子。
    去年十二月二十六日在东京练马车站附近，一个正在值勤的警察印藤突然被人暗杀。尽管并无丝毫证据，当局竟以此作为藉口，先后逮捕了小田原造纸公司东京工厂（在练马区）的工会会员松本鹤吉、须新田一郎等五人。并即非法加以审讯。审讯集中在工会的动向和被告与政党的关系方面，特别是与共产党的关系。显然，吉田政府的目的不仅在于诬告这些无辜被告为暗杀警察的“凶手”，并且蓄意嫁祸于日共。
    尽管审讯并未能证实吉田政府捏造的“罪状”，但是据法新社东京十九日讯，警察竟在二月十九日又逮捕了五名工会人员，其中两人是日共党员。
    吉田反动政府这一迫害阴谋，激起了日本人民的愤怒。工会和当地的居民都认为这是“第二个松川事件”，并为此提出了抗议。
