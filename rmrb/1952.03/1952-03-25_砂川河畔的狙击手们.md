	Snipers on the Banks of the Sagawa River
	On the front lines of Kaesong, on the banks of the Sagawa River, riflemen of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers have formed many sniper teams; they are active in front of the enemy's positions, killing and wounding many enemies with their accurate shots.

	The Rhee Syngman troops entrenched on the south bank of the Sagawa River often appear in front of the positions in groups of three or five, and sometimes send small units to harass and scout. After the snipers on the north bank saw these activities of the enemy, they quietly touched the place very close to the enemy one night, built several solid and ingenious bunkers, and then they lay in ambush there patiently waiting for the enemy. Since then, the enemies who came to the front of the position were often shot and killed by suddenly flying bullets.

	Among this group of heroic snipers is a young soldier named Chen Zhengjiang, who once shot and killed five enemies in one instance. Once, two enemies were going to a hill to change the guard. In order to cross an open space as quickly as possible, they stopped to rest behind a tree. Chen Zhengjiang aimed at this tree, and as soon as the enemy poked his head out, he shot one down with a "bang." Another enemy desperately ran into a grass hut in the open space. Chen Zhengjiang immediately aimed his gun at the door of the house. After a while, the enemy stuck his head out and looked around. Chen Zhengjiang did not shoot, but after observing the position of the enemy's probing, he aimed his gun more accurately. When the enemy poked his head out for the second time, he hit the guy's leg with the first shot, and then hit his abdomen with two more shots. The guy never moved again.

	The enemy sentries were frightened by the shooting and came up with a cunning way to defend against sniper bullets. Every time they changed guards, the sentry on the hill and the sentry going up the hill would run together, so that the snipers would not easily capture the target. Chen Zhengjiang saw through their trick and quickly aimed at one of the two enemies coming down the hill, moving the muzzle of his gun along with him. Just as the enemies on both sides ran to the open space in the middle, he pulled the trigger and shot one enemy down. The snipers lurking everywhere also opened fire together, killing two more enemies.

	Under the deadly blows of the snipers, the enemies squatting on the hill could not eat during the day, nor could they change guards; the enemies living in the small village did not dare to draw water from the well during the day, and the enemy's attempt to dig a traffic trench between the small village and the hill was also forced to stop.

	The enemy also tried every means to drive away the snipers on this line. They could not find where the snipers were hiding, so they kept sweeping with machine guns and bombarding with artillery day and night. One day, the enemy brought in several heavy artillery pieces and bombarded every suspicious spot on the north bank of the river. The snipers safely squatted in the bunkers, keeping their eyes wide open and watching the enemy's positions. Sure enough, six enemies, under the cover of artillery fire, ran timidly towards the sniper's position. The Liu Quansheng sniper team waited for the enemies to get closer and then opened fire together, knocking down three on the spot. The remaining enemies dared not come to their deaths.

	In the command post of this unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, there hangs a "Register of Eliminating the Enemy." The register records the records of the snipers killing the enemy: From January 2nd to February 26th, in fifty-six days, the snipers fought seventy-six times, killing and wounding a total of one hundred and twenty-one enemies.

### 砂川河畔的狙击手们

   砂川河畔的狙击手们
   新华社记者  韩庆祥
   在开城前线砂川河畔，志愿军某部的步枪手们组成了许多狙击小组；他们活跃在敌人的阵地前，用百发百中的枪弹杀伤许多敌人。
    盘踞在砂川河南岸的李伪军，经常三五成群地出没在阵地前，有时还派出小股部队来进行袭扰和侦探活动。河北岸的狙击手们看准了敌人的这些活动情形以后，他们就在一天夜里悄悄地摸到距离敌人很近的地方，建筑了几个坚固的巧妙的掩蔽部，然后他们就埋伏在那里耐心地等候着敌人。从此以后，到阵地前面来活动的敌人就经常被突然飞来的子弹打死。
    这群英雄的狙击手中有一个名叫陈正江的青年战士，他曾经一次就射死了五个敌人。有一次，有两个敌人要到一座山头上去换哨。他们为了要尽快地跑过一片开阔地，就先停在一棵树的后面休息。陈正江瞄好了这棵树，等敌人刚一探头，“叭”的一枪就打倒了一个。另一个敌人拚命地跑进了开阔地上的一座草屋里去。陈正江的枪口立刻就瞄准了屋子的门口，一会儿敌人探出头来东张西望，陈正江没有开枪，看好了敌人探身的位置，把枪瞄得更准了些。等敌人第二次向外探身时，他第一枪就打中了那家伙的腿部，接着两枪又打中了腹部，那家伙就再也不动弹了。
    敌人的哨兵被打怕了，曾想了一个狡猾的办法来防备狙击的枪弹。每到换岗的时候，敌人在山头上的哨兵和从山下上去换岗的哨兵便一齐对着跑，好叫狙击手们不容易捕捉目标。陈正江识穿了他们的鬼计，便迅速瞄准了山上下来的两个敌人中间的一个，枪口跟着他移动。正当两面的敌人对跑到中间的开阔地上时，他扣动枪机，就把一个敌人打倒了；隐伏在四处的狙击手们也一齐开火，又打死了两个敌人。
    在狙击手们致命的打击下，蹲在山头上的敌人白天吃不到饭，也不能换岗；住在小村里的敌人白天不敢到井边汲水，敌人企图在小村到山头之间挖一条交通沟也被迫停工了。
    敌人也曾想尽各种办法来驱逐这一线上的狙击手们。他们找不到狙击手们隐蔽在什么地方，就不管白天黑夜不停地用机关枪乱扫，用大炮乱轰。有一天，敌人调来几门重炮，朝着河北岸上每一个可疑的地点猛烈轰击。狙击手们安全地蹲在掩蔽部里睁大着眼睛注视着敌人的阵地，果然有六个敌人在炮火掩护下缩手缩脚地向狙击手的阵地这边跑来。刘全圣狙击小组等敌人走近了，便一齐开火，当场打倒了三个，其余的敌人再也不敢来送死了。
    在志愿军这支部队的指挥所里，挂着一份“消灭敌人登记册”。登记册上记载着狙击手们杀死敌人的纪录：从一月二日到二月二十六日的五十六天中，狙击手们作战七十六次，共打死打伤敌人一百二十一个。
