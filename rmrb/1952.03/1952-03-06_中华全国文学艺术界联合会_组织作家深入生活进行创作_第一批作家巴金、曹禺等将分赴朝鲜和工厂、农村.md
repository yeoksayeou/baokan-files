Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has begun to organize writers to go deep into life for self-transformation and literary and artistic creation.

For the past two years, literary and artistic creation has not been vigorous enough to meet the needs of the people. The main reason is that many literary and art workers have been detached from the masses and life for a long time. In response to this situation, literary and art circles in Beijing and other places successively conducted literary and art rectification studies from November last year. After this literary and art rectification study, literary and art workers have greatly improved their thinking and have generally recognized the importance of going deep into life and transforming their thinking. According to the spirit of this rectification study, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has decided to organize writers to go deep into life and engage in creation as the central task of its future work.

Recently, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has organized the first group of writers nationwide to go deep into the troops, factories, and rural areas to experience life. The first group of writers includes Ba Jin, Ge Luo, Bai Lang, Huang Gu Liu, Li Rui, Wang Xi Jian, Han Zi, Li Gao, Xi Hong, Lu Fei, Han Feng (all literary workers), Gu Yuan, Luo Gong Liu, Xin Mang, Gao Hong, Xi Ye (all art workers), Wang Xin (music worker), and Yi Ming (film director) going to Korea; Cao Yu, Ai Wu, and Jing Yan Dun (all literary workers) going to factories; and Ma Jia and He Jing Zhi (all literary workers) going to rural areas.

Before their departure, these writers made full preparations. They studied the documents of this rectification study, focusing on Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and Comrade Hu Qiaomu's speech at the mobilization meeting for literary and art rectification study in Beijing, "Why Literary and Art Workers Should Transform Their Thinking." They listened to reports from Comrades Lu Dingyi, Chen Boda, Xiao Hua, Chen Yi, Liu Zi Jiu, and Lai Ruoyu, especially Comrade Lu Dingyi's report on the ideological nature of literary and artistic creation, and Comrade Chen Boda's report on how writers should establish a "base of life" and how to describe new characters, which gave them great inspiration. The writers also held several forums to exchange experiences of experiencing life in the troops, factories, and rural areas, and resolved some specific ideological problems of some comrades. The writers going to Korea even made a pact to ensure compliance with work and life discipline. The writers have a high enthusiasm for this experience of life, determined to overcome the past erroneous idea of simply collecting materials, and emphasize self-transformation in the struggle, and guarantee to resolutely complete the creation task.

In addition, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has organized a group of writers to go to Shanghai to participate in the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence. This group of writers includes Ding Xilin, Liu Qing, Li Zhihua, Deng Zhiyi, Fan Jingyu, Ma Jin, Li Na, Chen Miao, Sun Xun Tao, Jia Ke, Yu Shan, Jin Tuo, Guan Lu, Huang Ruo Hai, and Mu Ye, and more than ten others, who will soon depart in groups.

    中华全国文学艺术界联合会
    组织作家深入生活进行创作
    第一批作家巴金、曹禺等将分赴朝鲜和工厂、农村
    【新华社五日讯】中华全国文学艺术界联合会开始组织作家深入生活进行自我改造和从事文艺创作。
    两年来，文学艺术创作不够旺盛，不能满足人民的需要，其主要原因是许多文艺工作者长期脱离群众，脱离生活。针对这种情况，北京及各地的文艺界从去年十一月起曾相继进行了文艺整风学习。经过这次文艺整风学习以后，文艺工作者在思想上有了很大的提高，多已明确认识到深入生活，改造思想的重要性。全国文联根据这次整风学习的精神，决定将组织作家深入生活，进行创作作为今后工作的中心任务。
    最近全国文联已在全国范围内，组织了第一批作家深入部队、工厂、农村，体验生活。第一批作家中赴朝鲜的有巴金、葛洛、白朗、黄谷柳、李蕤、王希坚、菡子、立高、西虹、逯斐、寒风（以上文学工作者），古元、罗工柳、辛莽、高虹、西野（以上美术工作者），王莘（音乐工作者），伊明（电影编导）；下工厂的有曹禺、艾芜、井岩盾（以上文学工作者）；下农村的有马加、贺敬之（以上文学工作者）等。
    这些作家们在出发以前，曾作了充分的准备工作。他们学习了这次整风学习的文件，其中着重学习了毛主席的“实践论”和胡乔木同志在北京文艺界整风学习动员大会上的讲演“文艺工作者为什么要改造思想”，听取了陆定一、陈伯达、萧华、陈沂、刘子久、赖若愚等同志的报告，特别是陆定一同志关于文艺创作的思想性的报告，和陈伯达同志关于作家如何建立“生活根据地”、如何描写新人物的报告，给了他们很大的启发。作家们并举行了好几次座谈会，交流了到部队、工厂、农村体验生活的经验，并解决了某些同志思想上的一些具体问题。赴朝鲜的作家且订立公约，保证遵守工作和生活的纪律。作家们对于这次出去体验生活，抱有很高热情，决心克服过去单纯收集材料的错误想法，而强调在斗争中自我改造，并保证坚决完成创作任务。
    此外，全国文联又组织了一批作家到上海参加反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争。这一批作家有丁西林、柳青、李之华、邓止怡、范景宇、玛金、李纳、陈淼、孙迅鞱、贾克、羽山、晋驼、关露、黄若海、牧野等十余人，即将分组出发前往。
