    Peasant Women and Female Workers
    --From the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea
    By Wu Wentao, Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Prague

    The first town in Hungary where almost all residents participate in agricultural production cooperatives is called Törökszentmiklós. The largest construction project in Hungary's Five-Year Plan is the steel city centered on the Stalin Iron and Steel Plant on the Danube River. During my visits to these two new socialist "attractions," I met Mrs. Gina Lajszny, the chairwoman of an agricultural production cooperative who is nearly fifty years old, and a group of female workers led by the young female architect Zsuzsa Tihanyi. Their work, words, smiles, and demeanor left a very deep impression on me.

    Törökszentmiklós has six cooperatives, the largest of which is called "Red Star." It was established in 1948 and has 1,600 members and 7,400 holds (each hold equals 8.5 mu). In 1950, it was awarded first place in the nation for increasing production by the Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture. This achievement is inseparable from the merits of Mrs. Sándor Szilágyi, the agricultural science instructor of the "Red Star" cooperative. Before liberation, Sándor Szilágyi was a poor peasant woman. After liberation, she had the opportunity to study agricultural science at the Agricultural College for three years. In 1951, she was awarded the highest Hungarian medal by the government - the Kossuth Prize.

    When I visited Törökszentmiklós, the secretary of the town's Hungarian Working People's Party branch and the town government's agricultural commissioner invited several cooperative members to talk with me. Next to me sat a tall woman with a healthy complexion tanned by the sun. She was Mrs. Gina Lajszny, the chairwoman of the town's "Lenin" cooperative. When the agricultural commissioner introduced her, he said: "This is Gina, who was a farmhand for half her life before liberation. She remembers the past and understands the present and the future. She is an organizer who is good at persuading people with personal actions and life examples." He also said: In Hungary's agricultural cooperative movement, about one-third of those in leadership positions are women, and about 30 percent of the members are also women…

    I wanted to ask Mrs. Gina Lajszny to talk in detail about how the 57 members unanimously elected her as chairman when the "Lenin" agricultural production cooperative was established in the spring of 1951, and how the spring plowing she led that year became a model for other cooperatives in the town. However, she modestly avoided this by citing the reason that "the work has just begun," and talked about how Hungarian women were oppressed during the Horthy fascist era, and how rural women today can only progress in all aspects and give full play to their talents by participating in cooperatives. She said: "Now that we have today's society, we must always think about its development; or in other words: women and men are two hands building the motherland, and it is impossible to do without one hand. The hand of women has the ability and the responsibility."

    These words reminded me of a recently published directive from the Hungarian Council of Ministers on increasing the number of women in the national economy. That document stipulates that in the future, in all sectors of the national economy and at all levels of state administrative organs, new workers and staff should generally be half women. In Hungary, if unemployment had not been completely eliminated during the Three-Year Plan (1947-1949), then in the first two years of the Five-Year Plan (1950-1954), the problem of labor shortage, especially a shortage of skilled workers, arose. This is a common phenomenon in the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe. The issue of a large number of women participating in social production has been placed on the extremely important agenda.

    Mrs. Gina Lajszny believes that we should learn from the example of Soviet women. She understands the great role of Soviet women, who were tempered in the Patriotic War, in replacing men in collective farms and factories. Finally, she also pointed out the remaining factors that hinder Hungarian women from participating in social production today, mainly the conservative and bourgeois ideas that despise women, as well as the rumors and slanders of reactionary Catholics and rich peasant elements... She compared these reactionary forces to weeds in the wheat fields, saying: "They must be weeded out in order to make the crops of the people's power flourish!"

    On the morning of the second day of my visit to Törökszentmiklós, I traveled from Budapest to the steel city on the Danube River, seventy kilometers south. Under the expanded Five-Year Plan, the investment in the construction of the steel city centered on the Stalin Iron and Steel Plant totals 4 billion forints (seven forints equal one U.S. dollar). When the Five-Year Plan is completed, the plant's steel output will be equivalent to half of the country's steel output in 1949. Comrade Antal Barovszky, the construction director with twenty years of experience, told me a story: A few days ago, Comrade Mátyás Rákosi, the General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, came and asked him (the construction director) what difficulties he had in his work. He replied that the only difficulty was that there was not enough labor, a shortage of four thousand workers, especially skilled workers. Comrade Rákosi said with a smile: "My idea is how to draw some manpower from you here!" Rákosi also emphasized the importance of strengthening the organization and cultivating thousands of young men and women - especially women - to become skilled workers. Barovszky particularly praised the female workers he led: "Given the appropriate conditions, there is no production task that women cannot complete, and in many places they even surpass men." According to the example of the "Rákosi" Steel Machine Factory in Budapest, where 50 percent of the employees are women, the proportion of female workers used in the Stalin Iron and Steel Plant in the future can be imagined.

    From the factory buildings, river port docks, to the residential areas separated from the factory buildings by woods and gardens, I saw female workers working alongside male workers everywhere. What moved me particularly was that there was a three-story building that was half completed, where from the engineer and foreman to the approximately eighty workers, there was not a single male worker, all were women.

    The 28-year-old architect Zsuzsa Tihanyi received the architectural drawings for this residential building, which includes sixty-four family units, four months ago. Her assistants are two female foremen – 19-year-old Júlia Kollár and 20-year-old Éva Tauz. In the middle of our conversation, a woman of medium height, wearing blue twill "lantern" pants, with her outer shirt sleeves half-rolled up, and wearing a "two-tile" style cloth hat of the same color, walked over, holding a meter stick in her hand, and discussed something with the engineer with a smile. This is Júlia, whose father died when she was eight years old, and who started working as a day laborer for landlords with her mother when she was nine years old. When she was thirteen years old, the Soviet army liberated Hungary, they were given land, and after enduring the difficult years after the war, her mother sent her to school. She entered a construction worker training class, studied culture and technology for one year, and then entered a six-month "foreman" training school. Now, she has nearly two years of foreman work experience. Her monthly income is 1,034 forints, she subsidizes her elderly mother with 300 forints per month, and it only costs four forints a day to eat in the factory's public canteen.

    Júlia loves her work very much. In addition to eight hours of work every day, she also studies culture, politics, and technology in the study group. I asked her: Is there any difficulty in building this house with all female workers? She said no, because in many cases where machines are used for transportation, there is no heavy work that exceeds the physical strength of ordinary women. She also has no difficulties in leadership, "It's just - she said with a smile - that everyone is a girl, with big mouths and long tongues (meaning they love to talk), but the girls are more meticulous and serious in their work than men!"

    At this time, Júlia waved her hand and called out "Éva! Éva!" A woman with a similar figure to Júlia, similar dress, and a slightly fatter face, ran down from a scaffolding more than ten feet high as if flying. Júlia whispered something in the ear of Comrade Katalin Kardos, the female translator from the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that Éva was about to get married. I hurriedly congratulated Éva and asked where her fiancé was? Her face flushed for a while, she just smiled and didn't speak, and asked Júlia not to speak either, but the engineer still said: Last year, her fiancé, who had just come out of the countryside to work, became a skilled worker under her leadership; they met, fell in love, and got engaged at that time. Now he is working on another building next door; maybe they will live in this building that Éva participated in building with her own hands in the future!

    Finally, I asked Júlia and Éva, the two foremen, to talk about their future plans. The two of them seemed to discuss it for a moment, and Júlia replied: "Work, study, collective entertainment, progress, and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time!"

### 农妇和女工——从黑海到波罗的海

    农妇和女工
    ——从黑海到波罗的海
    新华社驻布拉格记者  吴文焘
    匈牙利的第一个几乎全体居民都参加农业生产合作社的镇子，名叫图尔开维；匈牙利五年计划中最大的建设事业，要算多瑙河上以斯大林钢铁厂为中心的钢铁城。在参观这两个新社会的“名胜”中，我接触到一位年近五十的农业生产合作社主席吉娜·拉约兹尼夫人，和青年女建筑师素亚·蒂万所领导的一群女工；她们的工作和言谈笑貌，给我留下了十分深刻的印象。
    图尔开维镇共有六个合作社，其中最大的一个名叫“红星”，一九四八年成立，有社员一千六百人，土地七千四百霍尔特（每霍尔特合八点五市亩），一九五○年被匈牙利农业部奖为全国合作社提高生产的第一名。这个成绩是和“红星”合作社农业科学指导员山多尔·西拉格易夫人的功绩分不开的。山多尔·西拉格易夫人在解放前是一个穷苦农妇，解放后才有机会在农业学院学习三年农业科学。一九五一年，她又得到了政府授给的匈牙利最高奖章——科苏斯奖章。
    我在访问图尔开维镇的时候，镇上劳动人民党支部书记和镇政府农业委员，邀了几位合作社员和我谈话。我旁边坐的是一位高个儿妇人，长方脸上透着太阳晒成的健康色，她是本镇“列宁”合作社的主席吉娜·拉约兹尼夫人。农业委员介绍她的时候，这样说：“这就是解放前当了半辈子长工的吉娜。她记得过去，也了解今天和将来。她是一位善于用个人行动和生活事例来说服人的组织家。”他又说：在匈牙利的农业合作运动中，负有领导责任的，约有三分之一是妇女，约有百分之三十的社员也是妇女……。
    我想请吉娜·拉约兹尼夫人详细谈谈一九五一年春“列宁”农业生产合作社成立时，五十七个社员一致选她当主席，和当年她领导的春耕成为本镇各合作社模范的经过。但是，她都谦虚地由“工作刚在开始”的理由避开，而谈起霍尔梯法西斯时代匈牙利妇女怎样受压迫，以及今天农村妇女如何只有参加合作社才能在各方面进步，发挥她们各方面的才能。她说：“我们有了今天的社会，就要时时想着它的发展；或者这样说：妇女和男子是建设祖国的两只手，单靠一只手是不行的。妇女这只手有能力，也有责任。”
    这一席话，使我想起一个当时发表不久的、匈牙利部长会议关于在国民经济中提高妇女成员的指令。那个文件规定：今后在国民经济各部门和国家各级行政机关中，新的工人和工作人员，一般应有一半是妇女。在匈牙利，如果三年计划（一九四七——一九四九）期间还没有完全消除失业的话，那么，在五年计划（一九五○——一九五四）的头两年里，劳动力不足，特别是熟练工人不足的问题，就发生了。在东欧各人民民主国家中，这是一个普遍的现象。大量妇女参加社会生产的问题，就被提到极端重要的日程上来。
    吉娜·拉约兹尼夫人认为应当好好学习苏联妇女的榜样。她了解在卫国战争中锻炼有素的苏联妇女代替男子在集体农场和工厂中工作的伟大作用。末了，她又指出今天障碍匈牙利妇女参加社会生产的残余因素，主要是轻视妇女的那种保守和资产阶级思想，以及反动的天主教和富农分子的造谣污蔑……她把这些反动势力比作麦田的杂草说：“必须锄掉它，才能使人民政权的庄稼丰茂！”
    在参观图尔开维镇的第二天上午，我又从布达佩斯前往以南七十公里的多瑙河上的钢铁城去。在扩大了的五年计划下，以斯大林钢铁厂为中心的钢铁城的建设投资，共为四十亿福林（七福林合一美元），五年计划完成时，该厂的钢铁产量将相当于一九四九年全国钢铁产量的半数。二十年工龄的修建主任安却鲁斯·包劳夫斯基同志告诉我一个故事：前两天，匈牙利劳动人民党总书记拉科西同志来了，拉科西问他（修建主任）在工作中有什么困难。他回答说：唯一的困难就是劳动力不够，少四千工人，特别是熟练工人。拉科西同志笑着说：“我的想法，倒是怎样抽你们这里一些人力呢！”拉科西还强调指出加强组织，培养成千成万的男女青年——特别是妇女成为熟练工人的重要性。包劳夫斯基特别赞扬他所领导的女工们：“给以适当的条件，妇女没有不能完成生产任务的，很多地方还超过男子。”按照布达佩斯的“拉科西”钢铁机器厂百分之五十的职工是妇女的例子，斯大林钢铁厂将来使用女工的比例，就可以想见了。
    从厂房、河港码头、到用树林、花园和厂房分隔的住宅区，我到处看到女工在和男工们一同工作。使我异常感动的是：有一所已经完成了一半的三层大楼，那里从工程师、领班，到约八十个工人中，没有一个男工，都是妇女。
    二十八岁的建筑师素亚·蒂万四个月前领到这所包括六十四个家庭单位的住宅建筑图。她的助手是两位领班女工——十九岁的尤丽亚·考拉尔和二十岁的叶娃·陶兹。在我们谈话中间，一个中等个儿、穿着蓝斜纹布“灯笼”裤、半卷着外衫袖、头上顶着“两块瓦”式的同色布帽的人走过来，手里拿着一个米突尺，含笑地和工程师商议。这就是八岁死了父亲、九岁就开始跟着母亲给地主家打零工的尤丽亚。她十三岁时，苏军解放了匈牙利，她们分得了土地，度过了战后的困难年月，母亲就把她送去上学了。她进的是建筑工人训练班，学了一年文化和技术，又进了六个月的“领班”讲习所。现在，她已有了近两年的领班工作经验。她一月的收入是一千零三十四福林，每月补助老母三百福林，自己在工厂的公共食堂吃饭，一天只要四个福林就够了。
    尤丽亚很爱她的工作。每天除了八小时工作外，还在学习组学习文化、政治和技术。我问她：修建这所房屋都是女工，有没有困难？她说没有，因为在很多搬运都使用机器的情况下，就没有超过一般女子体力的重活。她在领导上也没有困难，“只是——她笑着说——大家都是女孩子，嘴大、舌头长些（意思是爱说），但女孩子们作工的细致认真，还超过男子呢！”
    这时，尤丽亚摆着手招呼“叶娃！叶娃！”一个身材和尤丽亚相似、装束相似、脸稍胖些的女子，飞也似地从一丈多高的砌砖的木架上跑来。尤丽亚和匈牙利外交部女翻译员卡多娜同志咬了一下耳朵，说叶娃就要结婚了。我忙着向叶娃致贺，问她未婚夫在那里？她脸红了一阵子，只笑不讲，并要求尤丽亚也不讲，但工程师还是讲了：去年，她那新从农村出来作工的未婚夫，在她领导下变成了熟练工人；他们就在那时认识、相爱而订婚了。现在他在旁边另一建筑上工作；说不定他们将来就在叶娃亲手参加盖的这所楼里居住呢！
    我最后请尤丽亚和叶娃两位领班谈谈她们将来的计划，她们两人似乎商议了一下，由尤丽亚回答我说：“工作、学习、集体娱乐、进步，随时准备响应祖国的号召！”
