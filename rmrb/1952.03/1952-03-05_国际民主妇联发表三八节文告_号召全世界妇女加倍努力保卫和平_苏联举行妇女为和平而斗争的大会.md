Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 2nd (via German News Agency): The International Democratic Women's Federation has issued a message to women worldwide in celebration of International Women's Day on March 8th, stating:

    Friends of all countries! On this International Women's Day, the International Democratic Women's Federation, representing 135 million women from 62 countries, expresses its friendship and sympathy to you.

    Women of all countries will celebrate today's "March 8th" with unparalleled enthusiasm. Wives and mothers have never recognized the necessity of united action as much as they do now, because the lives of their dearest loved ones are threatened, and even the survival of their homelands is endangered, due to the imperialist countries' frantic war preparations. They have never felt as strongly as they do now the great responsibility they bear for their children.

    Women face a noble task—to eliminate forever the terrible threat of the atomic bomb. We must stop the wars that are causing great damage in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya. We must consciously and resolutely oppose war preparations and military budgets that will be paid for with the lives of our children. We have a responsibility to stop the U.S. imperialists and their followers—the British and French imperialists—from realizing their sinister plans. We resolutely rise up to demand the defense of the rights of mothers, and we will not allow the destruction of the lives we have created. Millions upon millions of people are with us, and half of humanity is with us. The power of peace is immeasurable, and it is achieving new victories every day.

    We all want to live peaceful and happy lives. We must defend peace, no matter how great the sacrifices may seem; these sacrifices are insignificant compared to the suffering we will endure if war breaks out. Only a small handful of people want war. If we act resolutely, guiding thousands upon thousands of other women to join this struggle, there will be no war.

    Let us redouble our efforts to defend peace. Let us do everything we can to ensure the success of the International Conference for the Defense of Children, which will decide what work should be done to ensure that every child enjoys the right to life, health, and education in a peaceful environment.

    May this year's "March 8th" be a signal for the start of a broad movement including women of all countries. This movement will give women of all countries new strength to oppose war plans and will lead to the Third International Women's Congress.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: As International Women's Day on March 8th draws near, the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee and the All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge jointly held a Women's Congress for Peace on the 1st. Petrova, Executive Secretary of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, pointed out in her opening speech that defending peace has become the primary task of women's organizations in all countries. In the struggle against war, women have never been as active and organized as they are now. The International Democratic Women's Federation now unites 135 million members of various political and religious beliefs. They are tirelessly fighting for lasting world peace, for the defense of children, and for the economic and political rights of women. Petrova cited examples of women in capitalist countries who are bravely fighting to defend peace despite persecution, and then pointed out that the International Conference for the Defense of Children, to be held in Vienna in April, has received enthusiastic response and concern from people from all walks of life. Currently, national committees for the defense of children have been established in 28 countries, and national conferences for the defense of children have been held in some countries. Petrova concluded by emphasizing that Soviet women are tirelessly working to strengthen friendly ties with women in all countries.

    Soviet Supreme Soviet Deputy Lebedeva, "Soviet Woman" magazine editor-in-chief Ovsyannikova, Chairman of the Trade Union of Workers in Soviet Political Education Organs Trofimenko, and women representatives who recently returned from visiting foreign countries, successively reported on the situation of women in various countries fighting to defend peace at the meeting.

    国际民主妇联发表三八节文告
    号召全世界妇女加倍努力保卫和平
    苏联举行妇女为和平而斗争的大会
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社柏林二日电，据德意志通讯社消息：国际民主妇女联合会为庆祝“三八”国际妇女节，发表告全世界妇女书说：
    全世界各国的朋友们！值此国际妇女节，国际民主妇联谨代表六十二国的一亿三千五百万妇女，向你们表示友好和同情。
    各国妇女将以无比的热情来庆祝今天的“三八”节。妻子们和母亲们从来没有像现在这样认识到一致行动的必要，因为由于帝国主义国家疯狂的战争准备，她们最亲爱的人的生命已经受到威胁，甚至她们祖国的生存也处在危险之中。她们从来没有像现在这样体会到她们对孩子们所负的重大责任。
    妇女们面临着一个崇高的任务——永远消除原子弹的可怖威胁。我们必须使在朝鲜、越南和马来亚造成巨大损害的战争停止下来。我们必须自觉而坚决地反对战争准备，反对要以我们的孩子为代价的军事预算。我们有责任制止美帝国主义者及其随从——英法帝国主义者实现他们的罪恶计划。我们坚决地起来要求保卫母亲的权利，不许消灭我们所创造的生命。千千万万的人和我们在一起，人类的半数和我们在一起。和平的力量是无可计量的，它每天都在取得新的胜利。
    我们都希望过和平和幸福的生活。我们必须保卫和平，不管眼前的牺牲有多么大；这些牺牲如果比起战争发生时我们将要遭受的苦难来，那真是微不足道的。想要战争的只有一小撮人。如果我们坚决地行动，引导其他千千万万的妇女加入这个斗争，那就不会有战争。
    让我们加倍努力进行保卫和平的斗争。让我们尽一切力量争取国际保卫儿童大会的成功，这个会议将决定应该进行什么工作，来使每个儿童都在和平的环境下享有生活、健康和受教育的权利。
    愿今年的“三八”节是一个包括各国妇女的广泛运动开始的信号。这个运动将要给各国妇女以新的力量来反对战争计划，将要带来第三次国际妇女代表大会。
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：在“三八”国际妇女节日益临近的时候，苏联妇女反法西斯委员会和全苏政治与科学知识普及协会，在一日联合举行了妇女为和平而斗争的大会。苏联妇女反法西斯委员会执行书记彼特罗娃在致开会词中指出：保卫和平已成为各国妇女团体的主要任务。在反对战争的斗争中，妇女们从来不曾像现在表现得这么积极，组织得这么严密。国际民主妇女联合会现在团结着一亿三千五百万具有各种不同的政治和宗教信仰的会员。她们不倦地为世界持久和平，为保卫儿童，为妇女的经济和政治权利而斗争。彼特罗娃举例说明了资本主义国家的妇女正不顾迫害为保卫和平而进行英勇斗争之后，指出将于四月间在维也纳举行的国际保卫儿童大会，已获得了各阶层人士的热烈响应和关心。目前已有二十八个国家成立了全国保卫儿童委员会，一些国家中已举行了全国保卫儿童会议。彼特罗娃最后强调说：苏联妇女正在不懈地为加强和各国妇女的友好联系而努力。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表列别节娃、“苏联妇女”杂志总编辑奥夫桑尼科娃、苏联政治教育机关职工工会主席特罗菲敏科，以及最近访问外国归来的妇女代表们，相继在会上报告了各国妇女为保卫和平而进行斗争的情况。
