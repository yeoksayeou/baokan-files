Following the large-scale bacteriological warfare launched by the U.S. invading forces in Korea on January 28, 1952, from February 29 to March 5, a total of 68 batches of U.S. military aircraft, 448 sorties in all, intruded into the airspace of Northeast China, scattering a large number of insects carrying bacteria in Fushun, Xinmin, Andong, Kuandian, Linjiang, and other places, and also bombing and strafing the Linjiang and Changdianhekou areas. The facts are as follows:

(1) On February 29, a total of 14 batches of U.S. aircraft, 148 sorties, intruded into Andong, Fushun, Fengcheng and other places, and scattered insects in Fushun. According to on-the-spot investigations, black insects dropped by U.S. aircraft were found in an area of about 30 to 40 li around Dagou Village, Liandaowan, Liren Village, and Fangxiao Village in Fushun County.

(2) On March 1, 14 batches of U.S. aircraft, 86 sorties, intruded into Dadonggou, Changdianhekou, Kuandian, Ji'an and other places in Fushun, and scattered black insects resembling fleas in Majinzhuang and other places in Fushun County. One batch of eight aircraft also strafed an area ten li northwest of Changdianhekou.

(3) On March 2, 12 batches of U.S. aircraft, 72 sorties, intruded into Fushun, Andong, Dadonggou, Changdianhekou, Jiuliancheng, Ji'an, Kuandian, Changbai and other places, and scattered a large number of insects such as flies, mosquitoes, and fleas in Dagou and other places in Fushun County and between Fushun and Shenyang.

(4) On March 3, five batches of U.S. aircraft, 32 sorties, intruded into Andong, Langtou, Ji'an and other places, and released insects.

(5) On March 4, 13 batches of U.S. aircraft, 72 sorties, intruded into Andong, Langtou, Dadonggou, Jiuliancheng, Changdianhekou, Xinmin, Ji'an, Hunjiangkou, Kuandian and other places, scattering insects. At 11 a.m. that day, six U.S. aircraft were spotted over Langtou, dropping two cloth bags from an altitude of 5,000 meters. The bags scattered at an altitude of 2,000 meters above the ground, and a batch of flies was immediately found near the highway. At 2 p.m., one U.S. aircraft was spotted over Baiqibao and Raoyang River in Xinmin County, dropping a batch of flies. On the same day, after U.S. aircraft activity over Kuandian, flies, mosquitoes, crickets, fleas, and other insects dropped by U.S. aircraft were found in the east of Kuandian City and Hongshilazi and other places.

(6) On March 5, ten batches of U.S. aircraft, 38 sorties, intruded into Andong, Anping River, Changdianhekou, Hunjiangkou, Tonghua, Linjiang and other places. One batch of eight aircraft indiscriminately bombed and strafed Linjiang at around 8 a.m., injuring two residents and destroying five civilian houses.

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, in view of the fact that the U.S. government, in the process of delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and attempting to prolong and expand the Korean War, has dared to continuously and openly invade our airspace, scatter insects spreading bacteria, and indiscriminately bomb and strafe, slaughtering the Chinese people, hereby authorizes me to lodge a serious protest with the U.S. government against this most barbaric and brutal act of aggression and provocation.

The U.S. government's open and direct acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China began with U.S. President Truman's announcement on June 27, 1950, that the U.S. Navy would occupy our territory of Taiwan. On August 27, 1950, the U.S. troops invading Korea also began to invade the airspace of Northeast China with military aircraft. Since then, U.S. government military aircraft have repeatedly intruded into the airspace of Northeast China, conducting reconnaissance, strafing, and bombing. Now, the U.S. government is openly violating international conventions, violating humanity, and, following its large-scale bacteriological warfare in Korea, is scattering a large number of insects carrying bacteria in Northeast China, attempting to achieve its goal of aggression against China and threatening the safety of the Chinese people by means of the heinous method of large-scale massacres of peaceful people. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate this extremely cruel and heinous crime of the U.S. government, and it is bound to suffer a shameful defeat under the anger and opposition of the Chinese people.

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that in order to achieve its goal of expanding the Korean War and destroying peace in the Far East and the world, the U.S. government has not only used bacteriological weapons, which are absolutely prohibited by international conventions and human morality, against peaceful people and the Korean-Chinese People's armed forces in Korea, but has even expanded this crime to the peaceful people of Northeast China, using these illegal bacteriological weapons to carry out barbaric provocations. In its statement on February 24, our government pointed out: "If the people of the world do not resolutely stop it, then the disaster that has befallen the peaceful people of Korea today will befall the peaceful people of the world tomorrow." Now is the time for all peace-loving people of the world to rise up and stop this mad and heinous act of the U.S. government. We believe that the justice and peace of mankind are bound to prevail.

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China hereby declares that any U.S. air force personnel who intrude into Chinese airspace and use bacteriological weapons shall be treated as war criminals upon capture. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China also declares that the U.S. government shall bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from the invasion of our airspace, the use of bacteriological weapons, and the indiscriminate bombing and strafing and massacre of the Chinese people.

    我中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来
    严重抗议美国政府使用细菌武器屠杀中国人民、侵犯中国领空的声明
    美国侵略军自一九五二年一月二十八日在朝鲜发动了大规模的细菌战之后，复自二月二十九日起至三月五日止，先后以军用飞机六十八批，四百四十八架次侵入我国东北领空，并在抚顺、新民、安东、宽甸、临江等地撒布大量传播细菌的昆虫，并对临江、长甸河口地区进行轰炸扫射。事实如下：
    （一）二月二十九日，美国飞机共十四批，一百四十八架次侵入我安东、抚顺、凤城等地，并在抚顺撒布昆虫。经实地调查结果，抚顺县大沟村、莲岛湾、李仁村、方晓村周围约三四十里地区内，都发现美机投下的黑色昆虫。
    （二）三月一日，美机十四批，八十六架次侵入我抚顺大东沟、长甸河口、宽甸、辑安等地，并在抚顺县马金庄等地撒布类似跳蚤的黑色昆虫。其中一批八架并在长甸河口西北一十里处进行扫射。
    （三）三月二日，美机十二批，七十二架次侵入我抚顺、安东、大东沟、长甸河口、九连城、辑安、宽甸、长白等地，并在抚顺县大沟等地及抚顺、沈阳间撒布大量苍蝇、蚊子、跳蚤等昆虫。
    （四）三月三日，美机五批，三十二架次侵入我安东、浪头、辑安等地，并散放昆虫。
    （五）三月四日，美机十三批，七十二架次侵入我安东、浪头、大东沟、九连城、长甸河口、新民、辑安、浑江口、宽甸等地撒布昆虫。当天上午十一时，浪头上空发现美机六架，在五千公尺上空投下两个布包，距地面二千公尺即散开，当即在公路附近发现一批苍蝇。下午二时，新民县白旗堡、饶阳河上空发现美机一架，该机投下一批苍蝇。同日，美机在宽甸上空活动后，宽甸城东及红石拉子等地即发现美机投下的苍蝇、蚊子、蟋蟀、跳蚤等昆虫。
    （六）三月五日，美机十批，三十八架次，侵入我安东、安平河、长甸河口、浑江口、通化、临江等地。其中一批八架于八时许对我临江滥施轰炸扫射，炸伤居民二人，炸毁民房五间。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府鉴于美国政府在其拖延朝鲜停战谈判、阻碍和平解决朝鲜问题，希图延长并扩大朝鲜战争的过程中，竟敢连续公然侵犯我国领空，撒布传播细菌的昆虫，同时滥施轰炸扫射，屠杀中国人民，特授权本人对美国政府这一最野蛮和最残暴的侵略行为与挑衅行为提出严重抗议。
    美国政府对中华人民共和国，采取公开直接的侵略行为，是从美国总统杜鲁门于一九五○年六月二十七日宣布以海军侵占我国领土台湾开始的。一九五○年八月二十七日，美国侵略朝鲜的军队，又开始以军用飞机侵入我国东北领空。从此，美国政府军用飞机曾经多次侵入中国东北领空，并进行侦察、扫射和轰炸。现在，美国政府竟公然破坏国际公约，违反人道，继其在朝鲜进行大规模细菌战之后，又在我国东北大量散布传播细菌的昆虫，企图以大规模虐杀和平人民的罪恶方法来达到其侵略中国、威胁中国人民安全的目的。美国政府这种穷凶极恶的残暴罪行，是中国人民绝对不能容忍的，它在中国人民的愤怒和反对之下，一定要遭受到可耻的失败。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，美国政府为了要达到其扩大朝鲜战争、破坏远东和世界和平的目的，不仅在朝鲜对和平人民及朝中人民武装力量，使用了国际公约和人类道德所绝对禁止的细菌武器，甚至还扩大这种罪行，对中国东北的和平人民，也使用这一非法的细菌武器，来进行野蛮的挑衅。我国政府在二月二十四日的声明中曾经指出：“如果全世界人民不坚决地加以制止，那么，今天落在朝鲜和平人民头上的灾难，明天就会落在世界和平人民的头上”。现在应是全世界爱好和平的人民起来制止美国政府这种疯狂的罪恶行为的时候了。我们相信：人类的正义与和平是必然要胜利的。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府兹宣布凡属侵入中国领空、使用细菌武器的美国空军人员，一经俘获，即行作为战争罪犯处理。中华人民共和国中央人民政府同时声明，所有因侵犯我国领空、使用细菌武器、并滥施轰炸扫射、虐杀中国人民而招致的一切后果，应由美国政府担负完全责任。
