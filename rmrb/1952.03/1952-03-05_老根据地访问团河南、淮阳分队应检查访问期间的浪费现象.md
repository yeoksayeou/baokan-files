    Old Revolutionary Base Visiting Groups in Henan and Huaiyang Should Inspect Wasteful Practices During Visits
    Comrade Editor: In 1951, the Henan branch of the Central People's Government Southern Old Revolutionary Base Visiting Group's Eyuwan Sub-group and the Huaiyang branch of the Central People's Government Northern Old Revolutionary Base Visiting Group's Henan Sub-group engaged in serious wasteful practices during their visits.

    When the Henan branch of the Eyuwan Sub-group departed, they took more than twenty barrels of gasoline. Besides using nineteen barrels (of which two or three were wasted), they privately sold the remaining barrels. They purchased four boxes of porcelain commemorative badges (with Chairman Mao's image) from Jiangxi, with a purchase price and transportation cost totaling more than five million yuan. However, these commemorative badges were not distributed and are still stored at the CPC Henan Huangchuan Local Committee. The waste on photography was even more serious. In addition to the visiting group members taking photos of each other, many meaningless photos were taken. Furthermore, the visiting group's expense reimbursement system was also chaotic. Any member who needed money could get reimbursed with just a "note." As a result, the visiting group members could use state funds to eat and drink as they pleased. The situation of waste in the Huaiyang branch, in which I participated, was similar to that of the Henan branch. The expense reimbursement situation was extremely chaotic. As far as I know, there were problems with the accountant's records. The accountant, surnamed Mi, said: "My accounts don't balance." Later, the numbers in the accounts "balanced," but an additional one million yuan appeared. What exactly is going on?

    I suggest that the relevant leadership conduct an inspection of the above-mentioned expenditure situation of the Henan and Huaiyang branches of the Old Revolutionary Base Visiting Groups.

    老根据地访问团河南、淮阳分队应检查访问期间的浪费现象
    编辑同志：一九五一年中央人民政府南方老根据地访问团鄂豫皖分团河南分队和中央人民政府北方老根据地访问团河南分团淮阳分队，在访问期间，有严重的浪费现象。
    鄂豫皖分团河南分队人员出发时，带了二十多桶汽油，除用去十九桶（其中有两三桶是浪费了的）之外，剩下的都擅自变卖了。他们从江西买的四箱瓷纪念章（有毛主席像的），买价和运费共五百多万元。但是这批纪念章并没有分发，现在仍放在中共河南潢川地方委员会。关于照像的浪费，更是厉害。除掉有关访问团人员互相间拍照之外，还拍了好多没有意义的照片。另外，访问团的经费报销制度也是混乱的。凡要用钱的团员，只要有个“条子”，就能报销。因此，访问团的人员可以拿着国家的钱，任意吃喝。我所参加的淮阳分队，浪费的情况也是和河南分队相类似。经费报销的情况十分混乱。据我所知，会计人员的账目就是有问题的。那位姓米的会计说：“我的账，数目不对。”后来，账上的数目“对”了，但又多出现款一百多万元。这倒底是怎么一回事？
    我建议有关领导方面对以上所述老根据地访问团河南分队和淮阳分队的经费开支情况，进行一次检查。
