    Chinese Railway Workers' Xingcheng Sanatorium
    Self-Criticism for Not Emphasizing the Anti-Corruption Campaign

    To the Editor: The People's Daily published a letter from reader Wang Xirong on February 1st, criticizing our department for improperly postponing the anti-corruption campaign. This criticism is correct.

    During the Spring Festival, we considered the vacationers and other issues and, without approval from higher authorities, decided to halt the anti-corruption struggle for four days. The main reason for this disorganized action was that our leadership lacked sufficient understanding of the overriding central task: the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. We have already made a self-criticism to higher authorities regarding this matter.

    The reader's criticism also pointed out that we would ask anyone who had an opinion to leave the sanatorium. We also held a meeting to examine this point and found that a "fear of trouble" mentality did indeed exist among our leading cadres. The general rule is that vacationers stay for two months, but in implementing this rule, we did not patiently and thoroughly explain it to the vacationers. This old medical style is incorrect. We have also made a preliminary criticism and self-examination of this style during this movement.

    Currently, the anti-corruption movement in our sanatorium has reached a climax. Activists have all joined the "tiger-beating" teams, and the masses' enthusiasm is high. They are deeply besieging the big corrupt elements. This is greatly related to the readers' criticism of us. We thank the readers for their criticism.

### 中国铁路职工兴城疗养院  对不重视反贪污运动的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对不重视反贪污运动的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报二月一日刊载了读者王希荣的来信，批评我处不应把反贪污运动推迟，这个批评是正确的。
    春节期间，我们考虑了休养员等问题，未经上级批准，就决定把反贪污斗争停止四天。所以发生这种无组织的行动，主要原因，是我们领导思想上对压倒一切的中心任务——反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动认识不够。我们对这件事已向上级作了检讨。
    读者的批评中指出，谁有意见，我们就叫谁出院。我们对这一点也召开会议作了检查，证明我们领导干部中确实存在着嫌麻烦的思想。一般规定，休养员住院期为两个月，但在执行规定时，我们没有向休养员耐心详细加以解释，这种旧的医疗作风是不对的。我们对这种作风，也在这次运动中作了初步的批判和检讨。
    现在，我院的反贪污运动已达高潮，积极分子都参加了打“虎”队，群众情绪高涨，正深入地向大贪污分子围攻。这和报纸读者对我们的批评有很大的关系。我们感谢读者对我们的批评。
