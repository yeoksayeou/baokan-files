    Dihua Profiteers Collude with Corrupt Officials to Sabotage Hongyanchi Reservoir
    Stealing Over Thirty Billion Yuan of National Water Conservancy Construction Funds
    In the construction of the Hongyanchi Reservoir project in the suburbs of Dihua City, profiteers colluded with corrupt officials to steal over thirty billion yuan of national water conservancy construction funds, causing tremendous damage to the reservoir project.
    Dihua city is short of grain, with most of its grain supplied by southern Xinjiang and the Ili region. The construction of the Hongyanchi Reservoir is intended to solve the food supply problem for hundreds of thousands of people of all ethnic groups in Dihua City and its vicinity. After the reservoir is completed, it is expected to irrigate 80,000 mu of land in 1952. However, the contractors and profiteers Chen Ruishan, Hou Guizhu, and others colluded with Cai Zaifu (retained personnel), the leader of the construction team, and Fan Zonghan (retained personnel), the engineer in charge of construction, and recklessly cut corners. The low gate culvert, switch well, central partition wall supervised by the corrupt official Fan Zonghan in 1950, and the high gate tunnel project supervised by him in 1951, all failed to meet engineering standards. For example, the low gate culvert project, into which the state invested 1.1 billion yuan, was specified to be mortar-rubble masonry, but the profiteers actually used dry-laid rubble. When water was released in the spring of 1951, yellow muddy water was found seeping from the joints of the arch roof stones. In the autumn of 1950, the profiteers were passive and sluggish in their work, deliberately delaying the progress of the project. In order to rush the construction of the Hongyanchi Reservoir, the People's Government had to build warm sheds in the severe winter and work day and night for two months. In this way, the profiteers achieved their despicable goal of increasing prices for winter construction and stole more than 200 million yuan of state assets.
    Tang Zicheng, a profiteer in the automotive transportation industry, bribed Cai Zaifu 250 million yuan and Tang Shaohua (retained personnel), the purchasing agent, 50 million yuan to transport rubble. Cai Zaifu invested the embezzled money in the company of the profiteer Tang Zicheng as shares and conspired to steal more than 900 million yuan of state assets. The method of theft was: adding 17,500 yuan per cubic meter per kilometer for loading and unloading fees; using the excuse of transportation "needs" to purchase large quantities of gasoline from state-owned trading companies, and then increase the price by 280,000 yuan per barrel to resell to small contractors; over reporting the transportation distance by two kilometers per cubic meter; Cai Zaifu under-reported the quantity received. The profiteers Tang Zicheng and Zhai Fubin also colluded with Chen Hao (retained personnel), the head of the general affairs group of the engineering office, to transport 15,000 cubic meters of rubble, adding four kilometers to the transportation distance of each cubic meter of rubble, so that the profiteers stole 60,000 yuan in transportation fees for each cubic meter of rubble. When receiving the stones, Chen Hao over-reported by 1,100 cubic meters, stealing nearly 1 billion yuan of state assets in total.
    In addition, profiteers in the timber, iron, and lime industries also took advantage of the opportunity to steal state assets by various vicious means. For example, Wang Jiesan, a profiteer in the lime industry, colluded with Wang Dingguo (retained personnel), an engineer, and mixed 70,000 jin of stone slag into 700,000 jin of lime, which greatly affected the project.
    The organized and planned collusion between profiteers and corrupt officials to sabotage the project has created hidden dangers in the reservoir project and caused irreparable losses to the country and the people. The heinous crime of profiteers colluding with corrupt officials has aroused the unparalleled anger of people of all ethnic groups in Dihua City, and people of all ethnic groups have demanded that the People's Government severely punish them.

    迪化奸商勾结贪污分子破坏红雁池水库
    盗窃国家水利建设费三十多亿元
    在修建迪化市郊红雁池水库工程中，奸商勾结贪污分子盗窃国家水利建设费三十多亿元，使水库工程遭受巨大损害。
    迪化市区粮食缺乏，大部粮食靠南疆和伊犁区供给。兴修红雁池水库，就是为了解决迪化市及其附近数十万各族人民的食粮问题。这个水库修成后，预计在一九五二年可灌溉土地八万亩。可是包工奸商陈瑞山、侯贵珠等却勾结管理施工人员工程组组长蔡载福（留用人员）、工程员范宗汉（留用人员）等，肆无忌惮地偷工减料。贪污分子范宗汉在一九五零年所监修的低闸涵洞、开关井、中心隔墙以及一九五一年所监修的高闸隧道工程，全不合工程标准。如国家投资十一亿元的低闸涵洞工程，规定是浆砌片石，但奸商竟以片石干砌，一九五一年春季放水时，即发现拱顶石缝中渗流黄泥水。一九五零年秋天，奸商们消极怠工，故意拖延工程进度，人民政府为抢修红雁池水库，不得不在严冬中搭盖暖棚，日夜赶工两月之久，这样，奸商们就达到了冬季赶工加价的卑鄙目的，盗窃了国家资财二亿多元。
    汽车运输业奸商唐自成为包运片石，一次向蔡载福行贿二亿五千万元，向采买员唐绍华（留用人员）行贿五千万元。蔡载福将赃款投入奸商唐自成的公司入股，合谋盗窃国家资财九亿多元。其盗窃方法是：每方每公里多加装卸费一万七千五百元；藉口运输“需要”从国营贸易公司套购大批汽油，每桶再提高二十八万元转卖给小包商；运输距离每方多报二公里；蔡载福收方时，以少报多，甚至以空报实。奸商唐自成、翟福彬又勾结工程处总务组组长陈暠（留用人员）包运一万五千方片石，将每方片石运输距离多加四公里，使得奸商们在每方片石运输费中就盗窃了六万元，收石方时陈暠又多报了一千一百方，共盗窃了国家资财近十亿元。
    此外木、铁、石灰行业的奸商也纷纷乘隙而入，采用种种毒辣手段盗窃国家资财。如石灰业奸商王捷叁勾结工程员王定国（留用人员），在七十万斤石灰中，就掺了七万斤石头渣子，大大地影响了工程。
    奸商勾结贪污分子有组织有计划地合谋破坏，使得该水库工程危机暗伏，给国家和人民造成了不可弥补的损失。奸商们勾结贪污分子这一伤天害理的罪行，已激起迪化市各族人民的无比愤怒，各族人民纷纷要求人民政府予以严惩。
