The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles recently organized a group of writers to go to the Korean front lines and to factories and rural areas to delve into practical struggles and experience the lives of the masses, in order to transform the writers' thoughts and feelings and to obtain a rich source of creative inspiration. This is an exciting and celebratory event.

In recent years, our country has undergone astonishing changes in all aspects. A nation that had been oppressed and enslaved for a long time, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the wise Chairman Mao, after countless arduous struggles, has stood tall on the world stage. And the hardworking, brave, and intelligent Chinese people, once freed from their shackles, have unleashed boundless creative power. In these short two years, the greatness of the achievements of the Chinese people is immeasurable: We have defeated the aggression of the world's most ferocious U.S. imperialists against our friendly neighbor, Korea; we have changed the land system that has cruelly exploited peasants for thousands of years; we have suppressed counter-revolutionaries; we have restored and developed industrial and agricultural production; and in recent months, we have opened up a new front – launching a fierce counter-offensive against the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks in politics, economics, and ideology. As a result of the victory of all these struggles, our country and people have achieved unprecedented leaps forward.

However, when it comes to literature and art as a reflection of the actual struggle, it must be admitted that it lags far behind the development of our real life. Compared with the brilliant and rich reality, our literature and art appear so meager and impoverished. There are so many heroic figures in reality, but they are rarely truthfully shaped in our works of art. On the contrary, some works even distort the actual struggle and the image of our heroic figures. Can this phenomenon be tolerated? Can literary and art workers, who use literature and art as their weapons to participate in the revolutionary struggle, abandon their weapons or use them incorrectly? No, this is not possible.

Why does our literature and art present such a poverty-stricken phenomenon? Obviously, the most important reason is that many literary and art workers have become detached from the lives of the masses and from the actual struggle. And when literary and art workers are separated from life and from struggle, it is like fish leaving water, inevitably losing their creative life. The fact is this: for more than two years, many literary and art workers have abandoned creation and turned to administrative work; some literary and art workers are obsessed with urban life, greedy for comfort, and unwilling to go to the arduous struggle again. Of course, there are also many literary and art workers who are dissatisfied with this situation and are willing to delve into the lives of the masses and pick up their literary and artistic weapons again. However, they do not receive help and encouragement. Many literary and art institutions and groups only know how to busy themselves with banquets and socializing, and have long forgotten their responsibility to organize creation. Is it not a fact that these various reasons have created a widespread phenomenon of literary and art workers being detached from life and from struggle?

The result of literary and art workers being detached from life and from struggle is not only a poor harvest of literary and artistic creations, but also the degeneration and corruption of many literary and art workers in thought and life. The facts revealed in the literary and art rectification and anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movements in various places are good proof of this. Being detached from life and from struggle means that in terms of thoughts and feelings, one has left the masses, lost the common feelings, common likes and dislikes, common hopes and demands with the people. How can such people not be captured by bourgeois ideas, and how can they not fall into the mire of degeneration and corruption!

Therefore, going into the lives of the people, into the fiery mass struggle, is not only the only source for producing works, but also the main method of transforming oneself. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago that the life of the people is the inexhaustible and only source of all literature and art. "This is the only source, because there can only be such a source, and there is no other source." He also said: "Our literary and art workers from intellectual backgrounds, in order to make their works welcomed by the masses, must change their thoughts and feelings and make a transformation. Without this change, without this transformation, nothing can be done well, and everything will be out of sync." And the main method of transformation is to make friends with workers, peasants, and soldiers, to delve into the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to delve into the actual struggle. Only in this process can one gradually change one's thoughts and feelings and truly become a member of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. And "only in this way can we have literature and art that is truly for the workers, peasants, and soldiers."

Please remember the following passage from Chairman Mao: "China's revolutionary writers and artists, promising writers and artists, must go to the masses, must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, to the fiery struggle, to the only broadest and richest source, to observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all natural forms of literature and art, and only then can they enter the processing process, that is, the creative process, thus unifying raw materials with production, unifying the research process with the creative process. Otherwise, your labor will have no object, no raw materials or semi-finished products, you will have nothing to process, and you can only be the kind of empty-headed writer or empty-headed artist that Lu Xun earnestly urged his son never to be in his will."

Unfortunately, many of our literary and art workers have forgotten this passage, and therefore, either have always been or will become empty-headed writers or empty-headed artists.

Some literary and art workers have delved into the lives of the masses, and it is precisely because of this that they have written some better works. However, they are too easily intoxicated with these meager achievements, thinking that their lives are already enough, forgetting Chairman Mao's instruction that they "must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly," and severing contact with the struggle life of the masses who once nurtured and enriched them. In this way, they cannot help but wither away day by day like trees that have lost their soil. How can life ever be enough? In our country, life is changing rapidly and moving forward at a rapid pace every day, and many new and advanced things are emerging in life every day. If we do not deeply, comprehensively, and continuously study life, we cannot understand its development process, we cannot capture these new and advanced things that grow up in life every day, and we cannot describe the powerful forward movement of the people in our works. Such writers will be left far behind by the advancing tide of life and will eventually be forgotten by the people.

Some people also say: "What I lack is not life, but technique. I have life, but I lack the technique to express it." Of course, it is wrong to ignore the study of artistic techniques. However, one must know that true technique comes from deeply studying reality and correctly understanding life. Only by deeply studying life can we correctly describe life; therefore, for us, there cannot be any technique apart from deeply studying life. Once a writer is detached from life, his technique is finished, just as a fish's ability to swim is finished once it leaves the water. The colors of a painting are a reproduction of the colors of life. Without studying life, even the best pigments on an artist's palette will become waste. It is only by embarking on the right path of deeply studying reality and correctly understanding life that one can avoid simply pursuing technique, which will only lead to a dead end.

Still others say: "Life is everywhere. Being in the Federation of Literary and Art Circles is life. As long as one has thoughts, one can write." Thus, works that describe their own narrow minds are produced, and they believe that this is the most important life. But how can people understand "life" in such a vulgar way? Are revolutionary artists still advocating writing about trivial matters around them today? What educational significance do these writings have for the people, and what positive role do they play in the progress of our country? We are revolutionary utilitarians. We do not need this kind of waste. What we need are works that describe the lives and struggles of the people, describe the powerful forward movement, and describe the new heroes and new things that are growing up in life. It is impossible to produce such works without delving into the lives of the people.

All these arguments that defend one's detachment from life and from the masses should be put away now. After the literary and art rectification study and the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, most promising literary and art workers have deeply realized the danger of being detached from life and from the masses, and are working hard to change this situation. The fact that the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles has mobilized more than twenty writers (including workers in literature, fine arts, music, film directing, etc.) to delve into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and has immediately received their enthusiastic support, is an example. This measure by the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles is the first significant achievement of the literary and art rectification study. This method of systematically and preparedly organizing a group of writers to go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers has also set an example for literary and art federations in various places. Literary and art federations in various places should follow the example of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and mobilize the writers in their respective regions, help them delve into factories, rural areas, and troops. After experiencing life for a long period, they should also help them complete their writing tasks.

All revolutionary and promising writers and artists should always remember Chairman Mao's instruction: "Go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly." There are countless treasures waiting for us to excavate there. As long as we are willing to work hard and cultivate diligently, we will surely have a bountiful harvest. This is certain.

    长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去
    ——“文艺报”一九五二年第五号社论
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会最近组织了一批作家到朝鲜前线和工厂农村中去深入实际斗争，体验群众生活，以便借此改造作家的思想感情，并取得丰富的创作源泉。这是一件令人兴奋的和值得庆贺的事情。
    近几年来，我们的国家在各方面都呈现了惊人的变化。一个长期受压迫被奴役的民族在伟大的中国共产党和英明的毛主席的领导下，经过数不尽的艰苦斗争，已经在世界舞台上昂然地站立起来。而勤劳、勇敢和聪明的中国人民一经解除枷锁，就发挥了无限的创造力量，在这短短的两年多中间，中国人民所完成的事业的伟大是不可计量的：我们击败了世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义者对于我们的友邦朝鲜的侵略；我们改变了数千年来残酷地压榨着农民的土地制度；我们镇压了反革命；我们恢复并且发展了工业和农业的生产；这几个月来，我们又开辟了一条新的战线——对资产阶级在政治、经济和思想上的猖狂进攻举行了猛烈的反攻。由于这一切斗争的胜利，就使我们的国家和人民获得了空前未有的飞跃的进步。
    但是，说到作为现实斗争的反映的文学艺术，就不能不承认：它远远地落后于我们的现实生活的发展。和灿烂丰富的现实生活相比，我们的文学艺术是显得多么的寒伧和贫乏。存在于现实中的英雄人物是那样地多，却很少被真实地塑造到我们的艺术作品中。相反地，有的作品还甚至歪曲了现实斗争，歪曲了我们的英雄人物的形象。这种现象，难道是可以容许的吗？以文学艺术来作为自己参加革命斗争的武器的文艺工作者难道可以抛弃武器，或者错误地使用武器吗？不，这是不能够的。
    为什么我们的文学艺术会呈现这样贫乏的现象呢？很明显，最主要的原因是许多文艺工作者脱离了群众生活，脱离了实际斗争。而文艺工作者脱离生活、脱离斗争，那就如同鱼离开了水一样，势必失去了自己的创作的生命。事实正是这样：两年多以来，许多文艺工作者丢下创作转入了行政工作；一部分文艺工作者醉心于城市生活，贪图安逸，不愿再到艰苦的斗争中去。当然，也有不少的文艺工作者是不满于这种情况，愿意深入群众生活，重新拿起自己的文艺创作的武器来的。可是，得不到帮助和鼓励。许多文艺机关、文艺团体只知道忙于宴饮交际，早已忘记自己的组织创作的职责。就是这种种原因，造成了文艺工作者普遍地脱离生活、脱离斗争的现象，这难道不是事实吗？
    文艺工作者脱离生活、脱离斗争的结果，不但是文艺创作的歉收，而且还造成了许多文艺工作者在思想上和生活上的堕落与腐化。各地文艺界文艺整风和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中所揭露出来的事实，就是很好的证明。脱离生活、脱离斗争，那就是说在思想感情上离开了群众，失去了和人民共同的感受、共同的好恶、共同的希望和要求。这样的人，怎么能够不被资产阶级的思想所俘掳，怎么能够不陷到堕落腐化的泥坑中去呢！
    因此，到人民生活中去，到火热的群众斗争中去，不但是产生作品的唯一根源，也是改造自己的主要方法。毛主席早已指出：人民生活是一切文学艺术的取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一的源泉。“这是唯一的源泉，因为只能有这样的源泉，此外没有第二个源泉。”又说：“我们知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”而改造的主要方法，就是和工农兵交朋友，深入工农兵，深入实际斗争，只有在这样的过程中才能逐渐地改变自己的思想感情，真正成为工农兵的一分子。也“只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺”。
    请记起毛主席的下面一段话吧：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切自然形态的文学和艺术，然后才有可能进入加工过程即创作过程，这样地把原料与生产，把研究过程与创作过程统一起来。否则你的劳动就没有对象，没有原料或半制品，你就无从加工，你就只能做鲁迅在他的遗嘱里所谆谆嘱咐他的儿子万不可做的那种空头文学家或空头艺术家。”
    可惜我们的许多文艺工作者恰恰忘记了这段话，因而，或者一向就是或者将要成为空头文学家或空头艺术家了。
    也有一些文艺工作者是曾经深入过群众生活的，正因为这样，使他们写出了一些比较好的作品。可是，他们却太容易陶醉于这点微薄的成就了，以为自己的生活已经很够，忘记了毛主席所指出的“必须长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去”，而和那曾经哺养了他充实了他的群众的斗争生活断绝了联系。这样，他就不能不如同失去了土壤的树木一样一天天地枯萎下去了。生活怎么能够有够了的时候呢？在我们的国家里，生活是每天都在急遽地变化，飞速地前进，在生活中每天都涌现出许多新的、先进的事物。假如我们不深入地全面地而且持续不断地研究生活，我们就不能理解它的发展过程，就不能捉住在生活中每天生长起来的这种新的、先进的事物，就不能在自己的作品中描写人民的强有力的前进运动。这样的作家，就将被前进的生活浪潮远远地抛在后面，而终为人民所忘记。
    也有一些人说：“我所缺少的不是生活，而是技巧。生活是有了，只是缺乏技巧去表现它。”当然，忽视对于艺术的技巧的学习，是不对的。但是，要知道，真正的技巧，是从深刻地研究现实，正确地理解生活中获得的。只有深刻地研究生活，才能正确地描写生活；因此在我们，不可能有离开了深刻研究生活以外的技巧。作家一旦脱离了生活，他的技巧也就完了，正像鱼一旦离开了水，它的游泳的本领也就完了一样。图画的色彩，是生活的色彩的重现，离开了对于生活的研究，艺术家调色板上的最好的颜料也将变成废料。离开了深刻地研究现实、正确地理解生活的正途，而去单纯地追求技巧，那是只有走上绝路的。
    还有一些人说：“生活是到处都有的。在文联就是生活，只要有思想就可以写作。”于是产生了那些描写他们自己的狭小心灵的作品，而自以为这就是最重要的生活。可是，人们怎么能够那样庸俗地去理解“生活”呢？难道革命的艺术家今天还来提倡描写身边琐事吗？写了这些，对于人民有什么教育意义，对于我们的国家的前进起什么积极作用？我们是革命的功利主义者，我们不需要这类废料，我们需要的是描写人民的生活和斗争，描写强有力的前进运动，描写生活中成长起来的新英雄新事物的作品。要产生这样的作品，不深入到人民的生活中去是不可能的。
    这一切为自己的脱离生活，脱离群众辩护的论调，现在是应该收起来了。经过文艺整风学习和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，大多数有出息的文艺工作者已经深刻认识脱离生活、脱离群众的危险，而努力改变这种情况。全国文联这次动员二十几位作家（包括文学、美术、音乐、电影编导等工作者）深入工农兵生活，而立刻得到他们的热忱拥护，就是一个例证。全国文联的这个措施，是文艺整风学习的第一个显著的成果。这种有计划有准备地组织一批作家到工农兵中去的办法，也给各地文联树立了一个榜样，各地文联应该仿照全国文联的办法，分别动员本地区的作家，帮助他们深入到工厂农村和部队中去，经过较长时期的体验生活后，并帮助他们完成写作的任务。
    一切革命的、有出息的文学家、艺术家应该永远记住毛主席的指示：“长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去”。那里有无数的宝藏在等待着我们去发掘，只要我们肯勤劳地工作，辛苦地耕耘，就一定会有丰盛的收获。这是确定不移的。
