Northeast First Paper Mill Uses Sulfite Pulp Waste Liquid to Produce Alcohol

The Northeast State-owned First Paper Mill has researched a method for using sulfite pulp waste liquid to produce alcohol, which will generate huge wealth for the country through increased production and savings. The Light Industry Bureau of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government has planned to adopt this method for alcohol production in all its affiliated paper mills.

Most paper mills in China use the sulfite method to produce pulp, resulting in a lot of waste liquid containing sugars, hemicellulose, and calcium lignosulfonate. In the past, these waste liquids were dumped into rivers, which not only wasted many useful raw materials but also affected aquatic products and irrigation due to the strong acidity and excessive organic components of the waste liquid. The Northeast State-owned First Paper Mill, acting on the advice of Soviet experts in August 1950, established a fermentation group and began studying the use of this waste liquid to produce alcohol. After more than a year of experimentation, they finally succeeded.

The quality of alcohol produced using sulfite pulp waste liquid is no less than that of ordinary grain-brewed alcohol, but the cost is two-thirds lower.

According to statistics from the Northeast State-owned First Paper Mill, they can produce 1,600 to 2,000 tons of alcohol annually using sulfite pulp waste liquid, increasing profits by 16 billion to 20 billion yuan, while also saving the state more than 5,000 tons of grain used for alcohol production.

Shandong Paper Mill Workers Find Ways to Solve Pulp Loss Problem

Workers at the State-owned Shandong Paper Mill devised methods to solve the problem of pulp loss, and by last December, they had reduced the average hourly loss from 15 kilograms in November to 8 to 9 kilograms. After launching the increase production and practice economy campaign, the mill discovered that pulp loss was a major source of waste. According to statistics from November of last year, the average hourly pulp loss was 15 kilograms, which amounted to 315 kilograms per day (based on 21 hours) and 9,450 kilograms per month, worth more than 75 million yuan, totaling over 900 million yuan per year. After calculation, cadres and workers concentrated their efforts on combating the pulp loss phenomenon. Workers Cheng Xuebin, Wan Bingyao, and others found ways to strengthen the vibration of the slag remover, preventing small fibers from lingering, and changed the water pipe outlet for rinsing the slag remover from a direct flush to an angled flush. This reduced the hourly pulp loss by 1.14 kilograms. Workers working at the iron pulp basin also used water from the pulp sedimentation tower to wash materials and discharge pulp. Therefore, the loss from the pulp sedimentation tower was greatly reduced, the concentration of lost pulp was lowered, and the concentration of pulp recovered in the pulp sedimentation tower was also increased.

Northeast Smelting Workers Use Sintered Ore to Smelt Low-Silicon Iron

Workers at a smelting plant in Northeast China, under the guidance of Soviet experts, successfully used sintered ore to smelt low-silicon iron. This is a significant improvement in the Northeast steel industry. This improvement reduces the cost of raw materials for ironmaking by half, greatly shortens the steelmaking production process, and allows us to utilize lean ore in large quantities, saving the country's natural resources.

Northeast iron mines are mostly lean ore. Lean ore has a low iron content and cannot be directly put into blast furnaces for ironmaking. It needs to be processed into ironmaking raw materials - briquettes or sintered ore. The production of briquettes requires a lot of manual labor and takes a long time, so the cost is high. The production process of sintered ore can be fully mechanized, and its sintering time is also faster, so the cost is lower. The pig iron smelted with briquettes is the same as ordinary pig iron, with an excessively high silicon content. It must be refined in a preliminary refining furnace to reduce the silicon content before it can be used for steelmaking. Now that low-silicon iron has been successfully smelted, it can be directly used for steelmaking without going through a preliminary refining furnace.

During the Japanese puppet regime, the Japanese repeatedly experimented with smelting iron using low-cost sintered ore and took Northeast ore to Europe and the United States for research. They even specially invited American "steel experts" to conduct experiments, but all failed. However, with the help of Soviet experts, a smelting plant successfully smelted pig iron using sintered ore in February 1950, and then successfully smelted low-silicon iron in June 1951. Now, the proportion of sintered ore used by this plant has increased from 30 percent to 90 percent, and the low-silicon iron produced has also increased from the initial 19.3 percent to more than 90 percent. The silicon content stipulated by the Japanese puppet regime was 2 percent, often exceeding 2.2 percent; the current specification is 0.9 percent, often around 0.6 percent.

Chongqing Industrial Testing Institute Extracts Coal Tar and Refines Gasoline in Indigenous Coking Process

The Chongqing Industrial Testing Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government has successfully extracted coal tar and refined gasoline in the indigenous coking process. The gasoline extracted from coal tar is of excellent quality, and compared with gasoline on the market, it is more efficient in starting internal combustion engines and cheaper. The Southwest region is rich in bituminous coal, and there are already many indigenous coking plants. In the past, because there was no equipment for extracting coking by-products, these valuable by-products were wasted. Now, according to the results of experiments at the Chongqing Industrial Testing Institute, each indigenous coking plant only needs to install simple gas extraction and condensation equipment on the indigenous coking furnace to extract coal tar.

Northeast Building Materials Industry Bureau Successfully Trials New Types of Cement

In the past, the cement produced by cement plants in the Northeast was all high-grade (i.e., grade 600, 500, and 400) ordinary cement, and there were few grades. As a result, in capital construction, projects that should have used low-grade cement (such as grade 50 and 100) and projects that could have used blended cement could not be used according to their needs, resulting in serious waste. In order to avoid waste, the Building Materials Industry Bureau accepted the advice of Soviet experts and, with their specific assistance, began research and trial production of new types of cement in the year before last. By last December, five types of blended cement and cement with added mixed materials had been successfully trial-produced: ordinary cement, blast furnace cement, silicate cement, white cement, and clinker-free cement. According to multiple test results, the strength of these new types of cement meets the national standard specifications. This year, the Building Materials Industry Bureau plans to first increase the strength grades of cement from three to five (i.e., adding grade 300 and 200 medium-grade cement), and then continue to add low-grade cement such as grade 150, 100, and 50.

The Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government has issued a decision on the mass production and use of new types of cement in 1952. According to preliminary calculations, this year the output of cement in the Northeast cement plants can be increased by more than 20 percent under the existing equipment conditions, which is equivalent to building a new large cement plant.

Northeast Institute of Science Experiments with Soil Cement Wall Construction Method Successfully

The Northeast Institute of Science has researched a method of building walls with soil cement.

This soil cement is made by mixing water, cement, and soil in a certain proportion, and in the past, it was usually used to build various projects with lighter loads, such as light roads. In February of last year, the Northeast Institute of Science began to study the use of walls built with this soil cement to replace commonly used brick walls. After experiments, they found that a soil-to-cement ratio of 100 to 7 was the most suitable. This method involves installing a wooden mold frame on the wall foundation, then pouring the mixed soil cement into the frame, compacting it firmly, removing the mold frame, and then continuing to install the frame and compact it upwards. This construction method does not require skilled bricklayers; ordinary laborers can be slightly trained to do the work.

Walls of single-story houses built with soil cement have sufficient strength, can withstand rain and snow erosion, and are not prone to cracks and surface peeling. The soil in soil cement can be obtained locally, saving labor and money. Especially in areas where bricks, stones, and sand are in short supply and labor is scarce, soil cement is the most economical construction method.

    发扬工人阶级在生产上的创造性！
    东北第一造纸厂利用亚硫酸纸浆废液制造酒精
    东北国营第一造纸厂研究出利用亚硫酸纸浆废液制造酒精的方法，这将给国家增产节约巨大的财富。东北人民政府工业部轻工业管理局已经计划在所属各造纸厂中采用这种方法生产酒精。
    我国造纸工厂大多数是用亚硫酸法制造纸浆的，都有很多含有糖类、半纤维素和木质磺酸钙等的废液。过去这些废液都被倒到河里，这不但浪费了许多有用的原料，而且由于废液的酸度很强，有机成份过大，还影响水产和灌溉。东北国营第一造纸厂在一九五零年八月接受苏联专家的建议，成立了发酵小组，开始研究利用这种废液制造酒精。经过一年多的试验，最后终于成功。
    利用亚硫酸纸浆废液制造的酒精，品质并不次于普通用粮食酿造的酒精，而成本低三分之二。
    据东北国营第一造纸厂统计，他们利用亚硫酸纸浆废液制造酒精，一年就可以生产一千六百吨到二千吨，可增加利润一百六十亿元到二百亿元，同时还能给国家节省制造酒精的粮食达五千吨以上。
    山东造纸总厂工人设法解决纸浆流失问题
    国营山东造纸总厂工人设法解决纸浆流失问题，去年十二月已使每小时平均流失量由十一月份的十五公斤降低为八公斤到九公斤。这个厂在开展增产节约运动后，发现纸浆流失是厂内的一项重大浪费。根据去年十一月份统计，平均每小时流失纸浆十五公斤，一天（以二十一小时计算）就是三百十五公斤，一个月就是九千四百五十公斤，价值七千五百万元以上，一年就有九亿余元。经过计算后，干部和工人就集中力量和纸浆流失现象作斗争。工人程学宾、万炳耀等设法加强了除渣机的震动力，使细小的纤维不能停留，又把冲洗除渣机的水管口由直冲改为斜冲。这样，每小时可以少流失纸浆一点一四公斤。在铁浆盆工作的工人，又运用沉浆塔中的水来洗料、放浆，所以，沉浆塔的流失量大为减少，流失纸浆的浓度较前降低，沉浆塔中回收的纸浆浓度也提高了。
    东北冶炼工人用烧结矿制炼低矽铁
    东北某炼铁厂工人在苏联专家的指导下，用烧结矿制炼低矽铁成功。这是东北钢铁工业上的一项重大改进，这一改进使炼铁原料成本降低一半，又大大缩短了炼钢的生产过程，并且使我们从此可以大量利用贫矿石，节省国家的天然资源。
    东北铁矿多为贫矿。贫矿石含铁成分低，不能直接放入高炉炼铁，需要先加工制成炼铁原料——团矿或烧结矿。制作团矿用手工很多，而且时间长，所以成本高。烧结矿的制作过程可以完全机械化，它的烧成时间也较迅速，因此成本就低。用团矿炼出来的生铁和一般生铁一样，含矽成分过高，必须经过预备精炼炉降低含矽成分，才能炼钢。现在低矽铁制炼成功，就可以不经过预备精炼炉而直接炼钢。
    在伪满统治时期日本人曾多次试验用成本低的烧结矿炼铁，并把东北的矿石拿到欧美各国去研究，还特地把美国的“钢铁专家”请来作实验，结果都失败了。但是在苏联专家的帮助下某炼铁厂却在一九五○年二月用烧结矿制炼生铁成功，接着又在一九五一年六月制炼低矽铁成功。现在这个厂使用的烧结矿已从百分之三十提高到百分之九十，制成的低矽铁也从开始的百分之十九点三提高到百分之九十以上。其中含矽量，伪满时期规定为百分之二，经常在百分之二点二以上；现在的规格为百分之零点九，经常在百分之零点六左右。
    重庆工业试验所在土法炼焦中提取煤焦油精炼汽油
    中央人民政府轻工业部重庆工业试验所在土法炼焦过程中，提取煤焦油并精炼汽油，已得到成功。这种自煤焦油提炼出来的汽油，品质优良，与市场上的汽油相比，发动内燃机的效率更大，价格更低。西南各地蕴藏有相当丰富的烟煤，已经开设的土法炼焦厂也不少。过去因为没有提炼炼焦副产品的设备，这些宝贵的副产品就白白地浪费。现在根据重庆工业试验所试验的结果，各土法炼焦厂只要在土法炼焦炉上装置简单的抽气和冷凝设备，就可提炼出煤焦油。
    东北建筑材料工业管理局试制新品种水泥成功
    东北各水泥厂过去所生产的水泥，都是高级的（即六百号、五百号、四百号三种）普通水泥，等级也少。因而在基本建设中，本该使用低级水泥（如五十号、一百号）的工程和可以使用混合水泥的工程却不能量材使用，以致造成严重的浪费。为了避免浪费，建筑材料工业管理局接受苏联专家的建议，并在苏联专家具体帮助下，从前年起即开始新品种水泥的研究和试制工作。到去年十二月止，试制成功的混合水泥和渗加混合材的水泥已有普通水泥、高炉水泥、矽酸水泥、白色水泥和无熟料水泥五种。根据多次化验结果，这些新品种水泥的强度都合乎国家要求的标准规格。建筑材料工业管理局今年首先计划把水泥的强度等级由三种增加为五种
    （即增加三百号、二百号两种中级水泥），以后再继续增加一百五十号、一百号、五十号等低级水泥。
    东北人民政府工业部已发出了关于一九五二年大量生产和使用新品种水泥的决定。据初步计算，今年东北各水泥厂，在现有设备条件下，水泥的产量可提高百分之二十以上，等于新建设一个很大的水泥厂。
    东北科学研究所试验土壤水泥筑墙法成功
    东北科学研究所研究出用土壤水泥筑墙壁的办法。
    这种土壤水泥是用水、水泥和土壤按一定比例配合而成的，过去通常是用来修建荷重较轻的各种工程如轻便道路等。去年二月，东北科学研究所开始研究用这种土壤水泥建筑的墙壁来代替一般用的砖墙。经过实验，他们发现土壤和水泥的比例以一百比七为最适宜。这种方法是把木制模框装在墙基上，然后把配好的土壤水泥灌进框内，捣筑结实后拆卸模框，再继续向上装框、捣筑。这种筑法可以不需要技术熟练的瓦工，只要把普通的小工稍加训练就可以。
    用土壤水泥筑成的单层房屋的墙壁有足够的强度，能耐雨雪浸蚀，不易发生裂缝和表面剥落的现象。土壤水泥中的土壤可就地取材，省工省钱。尤其是砖、石、砂子不足和劳动力缺乏的地方，用土壤水泥是最经济的建筑方法。
