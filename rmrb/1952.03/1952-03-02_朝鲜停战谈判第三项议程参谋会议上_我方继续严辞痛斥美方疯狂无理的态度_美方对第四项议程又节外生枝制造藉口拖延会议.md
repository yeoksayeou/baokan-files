Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st – It has been a full week since our side proposed a compromise solution to the rotation and port issue at the staff meeting of the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on February 23rd. However, the other side still unreasonably insists on its proposal, demanding unilateral concessions from our side. On the issue of neutral nations, although the other side cannot but admit that the neutral nations proposed by our side fully comply with the definition of neutral nations agreed upon by both sides, it still opposes our nominations without any reason, even claiming that "further discussions are of no use." At the meeting on March 1st, our side continued to sternly denounce the other side's frenzied and unreasonable attitude, pointing out that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation have firmly and decisively rejected the other side's one-sided and unreasonable proposals and will continue to oppose such proposals and attitudes. The only criterion for resolving the issue of neutral nation nominations is the definition of neutral nations agreed upon by both sides. Neither party can oppose nominations that conform to the definition of neutral nations without reason.

On the Fourth Agenda Item subcommittee, the other side suddenly re-proposed that both sides immediately exchange seriously ill and wounded prisoners of war, and expand the exchange of prisoner of war letters, including packages. Our representative sternly denounced the other side for rehashing matters that had already been agreed upon and specifically stipulated, and matters that our side had fully refuted and disagreed with long ago, creating side issues. Their purpose is entirely to deceive the people of the world and cover up the truth that they are deliberately delaying negotiations. Our representative pointed out that the other side's behavior of avoiding discussing principles, refusing to solve problems, and using pretexts to delay meetings and hinder the realization of the armistice is intolerable to our side and cannot escape the condemnation of all prisoners of war and their relatives and the people of the world. The other side, being at a loss for words, became desperate and shifted to the issue of "exchanging" prisoner of war materials. Our representative sternly refuted this, pointing out that the other side is attempting to use its fabricated so-called 50,000 prisoners of war to evade its responsibility to provide basic materials on our captured personnel. Our captured personnel are now being subjected to torture and barbaric killings in the other side's prisoner of war camps, and the other side has a greater responsibility to immediately provide basic materials.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上
    我方继续严辞痛斥美方疯狂无理的态度
    美方对第四项议程又节外生枝制造藉口拖延会议
    【新华社开城一日电】自从我方在二月二十三日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程的参谋会议上，提出解决轮换和口岸问题的折衷方案以来，已有整整的一个星期，但对方仍然无理坚持对方的提案，要求我方作单方面的让步。在中立国问题上，对方虽然也不得不承认我方所提出的中立国家是完全合乎双方协议的中立国的定义的，但是仍然毫无理由地反对我方的提名，甚至于声称：“进行进一步的讨论没有任何用处。”我方在三月一日的会上，继续痛斥对方的这种疯狂无理的态度，指出朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军代表团已坚决而决定性地拒绝了对方片面无理的提议，并将继续反对这种提议和态度。解决中立国提名问题的唯一标准，是双方所协议的中立国定义。任何一方不能毫无理由地反对符合于中立国定义的提名。
    第四项议程小组委员会上，对方忽又重新提议双方立即交换重病、重伤战俘，和扩大战俘信件交换，包括包裹在内。我方代表痛斥对方就双方已经达成协议并作了具体规定的事项，和早经我方充分驳斥未予同意的事项重弹老调，节外生枝，其目的完全在于欺骗世界人民，掩盖其有意拖延谈判的真相。我方代表指出对方这种避免讨论原则，拒绝解决问题，藉口拖延会议，阻滞停战实现的行为，是我方所不能容忍，而且逃不了全体战俘及其亲友和世界人民的谴责的。对方理屈词穷，竟急不暇择，转到“交换”战俘材料问题。我方代表予以严辞驳斥，指出对方企图以其凭空臆造的所谓五万战俘，来搪塞其应提供我方被俘人员的基本材料的责任。我方被俘人员现在正在对方战俘营受着非刑拷打和野蛮屠杀，对方更有严重的责任立即提供基本材料。
