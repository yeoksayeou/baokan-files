    Patriotism and "Donation-Based Official Ranks"
    Zang Kejia
    Some capitalists, in the patriotic movement of purchasing public bonds and donating airplanes and cannons, demonstrated a certain degree of enthusiasm and contributed some of their strength. This patriotic spirit earned the people's praise, and their reputation and social status subsequently rose.

    The people trust and value those who have contributed to the motherland, and are generous in assigning them responsibilities.

    Matters cannot be treated as all the same.

    Some facts exposed in the "Three-Anti" movement tell us that the money some people donated in the name of patriotism was not "poured" out of their own "pockets," but was illegally obtained through ill-gotten profits. And it was not even the entirety of this "fruit," only a portion of it.

    These people did not cherish and make good use of the reputation and status given to them by the people to serve the people in return, but instead used them to serve themselves: stealing state property, evading taxes and bribing, engaging in speculation and profiteering, stirring up trouble, like fish in water. The result was: large amounts of illicit profits were secretly obtained again.

    Capitalists are best at assessing situations and calculating. Unfortunately, the set of methods they are accustomed to using in business is no longer effective in today's politics. The reason is very simple and easy to understand: in today's New China, the people are in charge.

    Patriotism is the goal, not a means.

    Status is responsibility.

    The "donation-based official rank" thinking of the reactionary regimes of the feudal era cannot have any effect if applied today.

    爱国和“捐班”
    臧克家
    有些资本家，在购买公债、捐献飞机大炮的爱国运动里曾表现了一定程度的热情，出了自己的一些力量，这种爱国精神博得人民的赞扬，他们的声价和社会地位随即高升了起来。
    人民对于有功祖国的人物是信赖的，重视的，在付给他们以责任的时候，也是慷慨大度的。
    事有不可同一而论者。
    从“三反”运动里暴露出来的一些事实告诉我们：有些人以爱国的名义捐献出来的金钱，并不是从自己的“囊”里“倾”出来的，而是违法的暴利所得。而且还不是这“硕果”的整体，仅是它的一部分。
    这些人，并没有珍重和好好利用人民给他们的声名和地位回头来为人民服务，倒利用它们为自己服起务来：盗窃国家资财、偷税行贿、投机倒把，兴风作浪，如鱼在水。结果是：大批暴利又暗中到手。
    资本家是最会看行情，打算盘的。可惜在商业上使用惯了的那一套用于今天的政治上已经失却时效了。原因很简单也很好懂：今天的新中国，人民在当家。
    爱国是目的，不能是手段。
    地位就是责任。
    封建时代的反动政权下的那种“捐班”思想，施之于今日已经是不可能有什么成效的了。
