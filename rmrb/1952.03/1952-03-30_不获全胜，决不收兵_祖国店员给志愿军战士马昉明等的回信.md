    We Will Never Stop Fighting Until We Achieve Complete Victory
    ——Reply from Store Employees to Volunteer Army Soldiers Ma Fangming and Others
    Editor's Note: Volunteer Army soldiers Ma Fangming and others wrote a letter to their brothers and sisters, the store employees of the motherland, on February 2nd (see issue 60 of this publication), hoping that they would actively participate in the "Five-Anti" campaign and not let a single unscrupulous merchant escape. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions of Shop Employees, representing shop employees nationwide, replied as follows:

    To Comrades Ma Fangming, Wang Yu, Liu Changren, Mu Zhenzong, Chang Jingquan, Song Chunqian, Li Ping'an, and other comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    We saw your letter to the store employees of the motherland in the newspaper. We deeply appreciate your earnest expectations for the store employees of the motherland in the "Five-Anti" movement, which has greatly encouraged the fighting spirit of our store employees.

    The unscrupulous merchants, devoid of conscience, have shamelessly stolen a large amount of wealth accumulated by the broad masses of working people of the motherland. Most hateful of all is that they even sabotage the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. This towering crime of betraying the people of the motherland has aroused the infinite resentment of our store employees and strengthened our determination in the "Five-Anti" struggle.

    At present, the store employees of the motherland have achieved great victories in the "Five-Anti" struggle. The store employees in most cities have already launched a full-scale attack on the unscrupulous merchants. In eight major cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan, as many as 450,600 cases of illegal activities by law-breaking capitalists have been exposed. In Tianjin alone, store employees have exposed 680 major unscrupulous merchants to date. Among them, 253 unscrupulous merchants stole state assets ranging from 1 billion to 20 billion yuan. But we are by no means satisfied with these achievements. We will definitely remember your words and resolutely eliminate the illegal activities of these unscrupulous merchants. We will definitely advance on the crest of victory, pursue and strike hard, and never stop fighting until we achieve complete victory.

    Dear comrades: We are fully confident that we can repel the bourgeoisie's frenzied offensive. We hope that you will continue to bravely strike at the American bandits on the front lines, force the enemy to abandon its aggression plans as soon as possible, and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at an early date.

    With best regards!

    不获全胜，决不收兵
    ——祖国店员给志愿军战士马昉明等的回信
    编者按：志愿军某部战士马昉明等在二月二日写信给祖国店员兄弟（见本刊第六十期），希望他们积极参加“五反”斗争，不让一个奸商漏网。中国店员工会全国委员会代表全国店员复信如下：中国人民志愿军马昉明、王俞、刘昌人、穆振宗、常经权、宋纯千、李平安等同志：
    我们在报上看到你们给祖国店员的来信，体会到你们对祖国店员在“五反”运动中的殷切期望，大大地鼓舞了我们店员们的战斗情绪。
    丧尽天良的奸商，无耻地把祖国广大劳动人民所积累下来的资财，大量地盗窃去了。最令人痛恨的，是他们竟破坏抗美援朝工作。这种背叛祖国人民的滔天罪行，引起我们店员们的无限愤恨，更加强了“五反”斗争的意志。
    目前，祖国的店员们已在“五反”斗争中取得了很大的胜利，大多数城市的店员已经向奸商展开了全面出击。北京、天津、上海、武汉等八个大城市，已检举出违法资本家的违法事件就达四十五万零六百多件。天津一市的店员到现在为止，检举出大奸商六百八十个。其中盗窃国家资财十亿元到二百亿元的奸商就有二百五十三个。但我们决不满足于这些成绩，我们一定记着你们的话，坚决把这些奸商的违法行为彻底肃清。我们一定乘胜前进，穷追猛打，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    亲爱的同志们：我们完全有信心可以打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻。希望你们在前线继续英勇地打击美国强盗，迫使敌人早日放弃侵略计划，争取朝鲜问题早日获得和平解决。
    此致敬礼！中国店员工会全国委员会三月七日
