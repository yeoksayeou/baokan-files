Five years ago, the area around Rakovski Station near Plovdiv in southern Bulgaria was still a field planted with wheat and vegetables. But now, there are rows of chimneys, rows of brand-new dormitories, and wide, flat roads. It has become an industrial city well-known and proudly regarded in Bulgaria – Dimitrovgrad.

In May 1947, in order to rapidly increase the production of chemical fertilizers and electricity, the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government decided, based on Dimitrov's suggestion, to build an industrial city in southern Bulgaria, including a chemical factory and a thermal power plant. Soon, the first group of 300 young male and female workers came to Rakovski Station. They said to the local farmers: "We are going to build a city here with neat roads, squares, huge factories, and gardens!"

The construction project was proceeding at a rapid pace. In order to meet the urgent needs of developing Bulgarian agriculture and the entire socialist economy, the Party and the government decided to complete the construction one year ahead of the original schedule, by the end of 1951. In mid-November 1950, representatives of the Party Central Committee and the government, led by Comrade Chervenkov, personally came to Dimitrovgrad to explain the significance of building Dimitrovgrad to all workers, engineers, and technicians, and called on them to strive to complete all construction tasks ahead of schedule by November 15, 1951.

Chervenkov's call was immediately met with enthusiastic responses from bricklayers, construction workers, cement and rebar workers, and technicians. Despite the winter cold, they persisted in construction work in the severe winter. Even at night, the cranes on the construction site were constantly active, the metal machines and tools continuously made clanging sounds, and the blue flames of electric welding shone in the dark night.

In the design and execution of the construction project, the sincere and vigorous assistance of the Soviet Union was extremely important. The Soviet Union supplied thousands of machines and parts; during the critical period of installing various equipment, the Soviet Union sent many experts and technicians. Soviet welder Liziantsev opened a training class for Bulgarian workers outside of his working hours, enabling them to more fully master welding knowledge and technology.

The ideal has finally become a reality. Under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and with the help of the Soviet Union, the builders of Dimitrovgrad completed all the tasks stipulated in the plan ahead of schedule on the evening of November 4 last year – ten days before the deadline. They excavated a total of 700,000 cubic meters of soil, laid 55,000 cubic meters of brick and stone, used 600,000 cubic meters of wood, assembled 88,000 meters of steel pipes between various workshops, and installed thousands of tons of various machinery and equipment. Not only have the huge "Stalin Chemical Factory" and "Chervenkov Thermal Power Plant" been erected here, but there are also rows of white residences located along wide roads, dozens of new shops, six cinemas, a theater, a modern secondary school, and a chemical industry technical school.

On November 5, on the eve of the 34th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, all the builders of Dimitrovgrad reported to the Party Central Committee, the government, and the people of the whole country the good news that they had completed the construction of the "Stalin Chemical Factory" and the "Chervenkov Thermal Power Plant." Outstanding workers and builders were rewarded by the Party and the government on that day. The people of the whole country celebrated this day as a major festival. After the establishment of the "Stalin Chemical Factory" and the "Chervenkov Thermal Power Plant," Bulgarian agriculture will be able to obtain 70,000 tons of chemical fertilizers from Dimitrovgrad every year, and the country's agricultural output will therefore increase by 30 to 50 percent. If converted into cash, this figure is equivalent to increasing Bulgaria's national income by 8.5 billion leva per year.

    季米特洛夫格勒
    五年以前，保加利亚南部帕洛夫迪夫城附近的拉考夫斯基车站的周围，还是一片种着小麦和蔬菜的田野。但是现在，这里有林立的烟囱、一列列崭新的宿舍和广宽平坦的道路。这里已成为保加利亚尽人皆知并被引为骄傲的一座工业城市——季米特洛夫格勒。
    一九四七年五月间，保加利亚共产党和政府为了迅速增加化学肥料的产量和发电量，决定根据季米特洛夫的建议，在保加利亚南部建立一座包括一个化学工厂和一所火力发电厂的工业城市。不久，第一批三百名青年男女工人就来到了拉考夫斯基车站。他们向当地的农民说：“我们要在这里建立起一座有着整齐的马路、广场、巨大的工厂和花园的城市来！”
    建设工程以很快的速度在进行着。为了适应发展保加利亚农业和整个社会主义经济的迫切需要，党和政府决定把完成建设的原定期限提前一年于一九五一年底完成。一九五○年十一月中，以契尔文科夫同志为首的党中央和政府的代表们亲自来到季米特洛夫格勒，向全体工人、工程师和技术人员说明建设季米特洛夫格勒的意义，并号召他们争取在一九五一年十一月十五日提前完成全部建设任务。
    契尔文科夫的号召立刻得到了砖瓦工人、土木工人、水泥钢骨工人和技术人员们的热烈响应，他们不顾冬季的寒冷，在严冬里仍然坚持进行建筑工程。甚至在夜里，建筑现场上的起重机还在不断的活动着，金属的机器和工具不断地发出铿然的响声，电焊的青蓝色火焰在黑夜里发着亮光。
    在建设工程的设计和进行中，苏联的真诚的、大力的帮助是十分重要的。苏联供给了成千成百具的机器和零件；在装置各种设备的紧要时期，苏联又派来了许多专家和技术人员，苏联电焊工人利齐安采夫在他的工作时间之外，为保加利亚工人开办了一个训练班，使他们能更充分地掌握电焊知识和技术。
    理想终于成为现实了。季米特洛夫格勒的建设者在保加利亚共产党的领导之下和苏联的帮助之下，在去年十一月四日——限期前十天的晚上，把计划所规定的一切任务都提前完成了。他们共挖掘了七十万立方公尺的泥土，铺砌了五万五千立方公尺的砖石，用去了六十万立方公尺的木材，在各个车间之间装配了八万八千公尺的钢管，装置了成千吨的各种机器设备。这里不但矗立起巨大的“斯大林化学工厂”和“契尔文科夫火力发电厂”，而且还有一列列座落在宽广道路旁的白色住宅，数十家新商店，六个电影院，一所剧院，一所现代化的中级学校，一所化学工业技术学校。
    十一月五日，在伟大十月社会主义革命三十四周年的前夕，季米特洛夫格勒的全体建设者向党中央、政府和全国人民报告他们完成建设“斯大林化学工厂”和“契尔文科夫火力发电厂”的喜讯。优秀的工人和建设者在那一天受到了党和政府的奖励。全国人民都把这一天作为重大的节日来庆祝。“斯大林化学工厂”和“契尔文科夫火力发电厂”建立以后，保加利亚的农业每年将可自季米特洛夫格勒获得七万吨的化学肥料，全国的农业产量因此而将要提高百分之三十至五十。如折合现金计算，这个数字等于使保加利亚国家每年增加八十五亿里瓦的收入。
