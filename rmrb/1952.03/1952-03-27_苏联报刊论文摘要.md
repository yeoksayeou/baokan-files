Improve Leadership over District Newspapers

    The Pravda of the Soviet Union published an article by Podkourkov on February 28th on how the district party committees in various regions should improve their leadership over the district newspapers. The abstract is as follows:

    District newspapers are directly related to local life. A good district newspaper is a powerful tool in the hands of the district party committee for carrying out communist education among the socialist rural workers and organizing them to successfully complete the tasks assigned to the district.

    However, it must be pointed out that many district party committees do not lead their newspapers very well. Many district newspapers are filled with various resolutions from local authorities, news of meetings of all sizes, various reprinted works and reports; this squeezes out materials about the life of the district and the constructive labor of the Soviet people from the newspaper pages. The newspaper becomes an organ bulletin, thereby losing its face as a mass newspaper.

    The district newspaper is a mass newspaper. However, district newspapers are generally filled with articles by editors, while party and Soviet activists, advanced producers, and rural intellectuals are not absorbed into the newspaper work.

    The lack of writing activists proves that the newspaper is divorced from the broad masses. This is not merely a shortcoming of the newspaper, but a shortcoming that is extremely contrary to the Bolshevik news tradition. This shortcoming will change the essence of the newspaper and imbue the entire style of the newspaper with the nature of bureaucracy and red tape.

    Leading the newspaper is by no means about supervising the trivial matters of the editorial department. The leadership of the district party committee lies first and foremost in continuously improving the ideological content of its newspaper. The party committee should be responsible for giving the editorial department direction, so that it elucidates the most important issues in the life of the district, and at the same time use it to mobilize rural workers to complete the main tasks of agriculture - to increase the yield of various crops and to expand the number of public livestock with all efforts under the condition of improving livestock productivity.

    The district party committee should guide the newspaper to cultivate the laboring people's conscious communist attitude towards labor and public economy, and guide the newspaper to fight for stricter compliance with the regulations of agricultural labor cooperatives. The task of the district newspaper is to popularize the scientific management methods of agriculture and the achievements of advanced agronomists; to summarize and promote the experiences of advanced collective farms and machine tractor stations, as well as the working methods of skilled cultivators and livestock breeders, tractor drivers, combine operators, and mechanics; and to comprehensively elucidate the work of local industries, cultural and educational institutions, schools, rural soviets, and party and communist youth league organizations.

    Our newspaper is a weapon of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism. The responsibility of party leadership is to launch serious Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism in the newspaper against the shortcomings in the work existing in various collective farms, machine tractor stations, state farms, local industrial enterprises, rural soviets, agricultural organs, cultural organs and social organizations. The district party committee must actively support fair and critical remarks in the newspaper and strive to improve the level and effectiveness of criticism.

    The party committee and its first secretary should be concerned about the content of the newspaper, pay attention to expanding the topics of the newspaper, should assign specific tasks to the editorial department within a certain period, and help them complete these tasks. The party committee must help the editorial department to carry out the organizational work of writing activists and readers. Party workers themselves should also directly participate in newspaper work and write articles for the newspaper regularly.

    Replenishing the newspaper editorial department with capable journalists is a basic condition for improving the district newspaper. It is the responsibility of the party committee to always pay attention to the selection, education, and training of journalists.

    The periodic publication of reviews of district newspapers by the newspapers of the republic, border region, and province can provide very important assistance to the district newspapers. Unfortunately, many of our republic, border region, and province newspapers have not fulfilled this responsibility very well.

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

    改善对区报纸的领导
    苏联真理报二月二十八日登载了波德库尔科夫论各地党的区委会应改善对本区报纸的领导的论文。摘要如下：
    区报纸是和当地生活直接联系着的。好的区报纸是区党委手中对社会主义农村劳动者进行共产主义教育、组织他们顺利解决本区所负任务的有力工具。
    但是必须指出，许多区党委对他们的报纸还领导得不很好。很多区报纸上堆满了地方机关的各类决议、大小会议的消息、各种转载的作品和汇报；这样就把有关本区生活和苏联人的建设性劳动的材料，从报面上挤掉了。报纸变成了机关公报，从而丧失了群众报纸的面目。
    区报是群众性的报纸。但一般区报纸往往登满了编辑部人员的文章，至于党和苏维埃的积极分子、先进生产者和农村知识分子，却没有被吸收来参加报纸工作。
    缺乏写作积极分子，证明报纸是脱离广大群众的。这不单纯是报纸的一个缺点，而是极端违背布尔什维克新闻传统的一种缺点。这种缺点会改变报纸的实质，使报纸的全部风格染上官僚主义和文牍主义的性质。
    领导报纸，绝不是要监督编辑部的琐碎事物。区党委的领导首先在于不断地改善它的报纸的思想内容。党委员会应负责给编辑部以方向，使它阐明本区生活中最重要的问题，同时并应利用它动员农村劳动者完成农业的主要任务——提高各种农作物的收获量，在提高牲畜生产率的条件下，全力扩大公共牲畜的头数。
    党的区委会应指导报纸来培养劳动人民对劳动和公共经济的自觉的共产主义态度，指导报纸为争取更严格地遵守农业劳动组合章程而进行斗争。区报纸的任务是要普及农业的科学管理方法和先进农艺家的成就；总结和推广先进的集体农场和机器拖拉机站的经验以及耕作和牲畜饲养能手、拖拉机手、康拜因机手、机匠的工作方法；全面地阐明地方工业、文化教育机关、学校、农村苏维埃以及党和共青团组织的工作。
    我们的报纸是布尔什维克的批评和自我批评的武器。党的领导责任，就是要在报纸上针对存在于各集体农场、机器拖拉机站、国营农场、地方工业企业、农村苏维埃、农业机关、文化机关和社会团体中的工作缺点，展开认真的布尔什维克的批评和自我批评。党的区委会必须积极支持报纸上公正的、批评性的言论，并努力提高批评的水平和效果。
    党委会和它的第一书记应当关切报纸的内容，注意扩大报纸的论题，应该在一定的时期内为编辑部布置具体任务，并帮助他们完成这些任务。党委会必须帮助编辑部来进行写作积极分子和读者的组织工作。党的工作人员自己也应当直接参加报纸工作，经常为报纸写文章。
    以有能力的新闻工作干部来充实报纸编辑部，是改进区报纸的一个基本条件。党委员会的责任就是要经常注意选拔、教育和培养新闻工作者。
    共和国、边区和省的报纸定期发表区报纸的述评，可以给区报纸以很重要的帮助。可惜的是我们的很多共和国、边区和省的报纸还没有很好地尽到这一职责。
