In his speech, General Peng Dehuai pointed out: "The U.S. aggressors are attempting to use extremely vicious bacteriological weapons to achieve the aggressive goals they cannot achieve at the negotiation table and on the battlefield, but bacteriological warfare has not intimidated the righteous Korean and Chinese People's Armies. We can say with certainty that the bacteriological warfare of the U.S. aggressors is bound to meet a shameful and miserable defeat. No matter how vicious the tricks of the U.S. aggressor troops are, they cannot change the predetermined outcome of their final defeat." He concluded by saying: "We will do our best to assist the investigation group in its work and hope that the investigation group will publicize the findings to the world, so that the people of the world can recognize the ugly and inhuman face of U.S. imperialism."

They represented the various democratic parties, people's organizations, and the people of the whole country in paying high tribute to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, who are standing on the forefront of defending peace. Li Dequan said: "Our investigation group has been divided into groups to conduct investigations in various epidemic areas and has already obtained evidence of the U.S. imperialists' bacteriological warfare crimes. After our investigation is completed, we will publish our investigation report to the world, calling on the Chinese people and the people of the world to unite and cut off the bloody hands of the U.S. aggressors, and vigorously support the Korean people and the Chinese and Korean People's Armies to crush the bacteriological warfare of the U.S. aggressors!"

    【新华社朝鲜前线二十八日电】中国人民志愿军领导机关三月二十六日集会欢迎最近从祖国来到朝鲜的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”。到会的有中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军、朝鲜人民军代表朴一禹将军，以及志愿军司令部、政治部代表等。彭德怀将军致欢迎词。他代表志愿军全体指挥员和战斗员感谢祖国人民的深切关怀，并对调查团团长、中国红十字会会长李德全及其调查团的到来表示十分欢迎。彭德怀将军在讲话中指出：“美国侵略者妄图用极端毒辣的细菌武器，来达到其在谈判会议桌上和战场上达不到的侵略目的，但细菌战并没有吓倒正义的朝中人民军队。我们可以肯定地说，美国侵略者的细菌战一定要遭到可耻的惨败。美国侵略军任何恶毒伎俩，丝毫不能改变其最后失败的既定结局。”他最后说：“我们将尽力协助调查团进行工作，并希望调查团将调查所得公诸世界，使全世界的人民都能认清美帝国主义灭绝人性的丑恶面目。”接着“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”团长李德全、副团长廖承志相继致词。他们代表中国各民主党派、各人民团体和全国人民向站在保卫和平最前线的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军致崇高的敬意。李德全说：“我们调查团已分组前往各疫区进行调查，并已获得美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪证。在我们调查完毕后，我们将向全世界公布我们的调查报告，号召中国人民和世界人民一致起来，斩断美国侵略者罪恶的血手，并大力支援朝鲜人民和中朝人民军队，粉碎美国侵略者的细菌战！”
