    To Increase the Per-Unit Area Yield of Farmland and Strive for a General Good Harvest,
    Cooperatives Across the Country Vigorously Supply Fertilizer
    [Our Newspaper] Cooperatives across the country have prepared large quantities of cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizers, and are planning to supply the needs of farmers for this year's production. At the cooperative fertilizer supply conference of the major administrative regions (excluding the Northeast) convened by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives in December last year, it was proposed to complete the total task of supplying 2.28 million tons of fertilizer (including 280,000 tons of chemical fertilizer) with a national loan of 1.5 trillion yuan. In addition to a portion of this fertilizer being transferred from the Northeast to supply various regions, the vast majority is to be raised, processed, manufactured, and purchased by local cooperatives themselves. Therefore, local people's governments have successively issued instructions on completing the local fertilizer supply tasks, and cooperatives have formulated specific procurement, processing, and supply plans, and actively carried out the fertilizer business. At present, the fertilizer transferred from the Northeast has reached more than one-third of the total to be transferred for the whole year, and has been successively distributed to various regions. As of mid-March, the fertilizer raised, processed, and purchased by various regions has completed 80 percent of the first quarter task planned by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives. During the same period, the completion of the quarterly plan in various major administrative regions was: East China completed 87 percent, North China completed 75 percent, Central South completed 92 percent, Northwest completed 68 percent, and the Southwest region's completion of this task was slightly worse. Due to the increasing strength of cooperatives in various regions, it is estimated that the task of processing and manufacturing fertilizer and purchasing fertilizer in the first quarter can be successfully completed.
    The amount of fertilizer planned to be supplied by cooperatives in various regions this year has greatly exceeded that of last year. For example, in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, an important wheat and cotton producing area, the estimated fertilizer supply this year is three and a half times that of last year. The fertilizer supplied to farmers by cooperatives in the entire Southwest region this year is enough for base fertilizer and topdressing on more than 9 million mu of farmland, which greatly exceeds the amount of fertilizer supplied last year. This situation has come about as farmers' demand for fertilizer has increased. Farmers in various parts of East China are actively responding to the government's call to increase per-unit area yield, and their enthusiasm for production is high. Cooperatives in various regions have fully prepared fertilizer. For example, in Jiaozhou, Shandong, and other places, there have been cases of increasing the planned number of fertilizer supplies. In Jiande County, Zhejiang, 80 percent of farmers have ordered fertilizer from cooperatives.
    In carrying out the fertilizer supply business, cooperatives in various regions have continuously criticized the erroneous understanding of some cadres on the work of supplying fertilizer, and helped them establish correct ideas. For example, some cadres mistakenly believed that "cooperatives do not need to supply fertilizer, the masses will prepare fertilizer themselves"; "fertilizer supply is the government's business, and has nothing to do with cooperatives," and so on. After criticism and education, they reversed their thinking, clarified their understanding that the supply of fertilizer is an important condition for ensuring increased agricultural production, and recognized that carrying out the fertilizer supply business can develop and consolidate cooperatives.
    The main methods adopted by cooperatives in various regions to supply fertilizer are as follows:
    "Storing goods for advance sales," that is, reserving fertilizer for farmers to purchase, and absorbing considerable physical objects from farmers in advance; "spot sales," that is, farmers purchase fertilizer with cash; "credit purchases," that is, in order to take care of farmers in disaster-stricken areas last year who were unable to purchase fertilizer, cooperatives sell fertilizer to them on credit, and collect agricultural products in the future. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient funds for fertilizer supply, cooperatives in various regions this year have promoted the method of "storing goods for advance sales of fertilizer." Southern Jiangsu area of East China and other places actively promoted this method and created very good experience. Cooperatives in Southern Jiangsu issued instructions in December last year to mobilize members and non-member farmers to store three kinds of physical objects: rice, soybeans, and cotton, to pre-purchase fertilizer. The cooperative pays farmers interest of one percent per month for the stored goods. Other cooperatives in various regions are also gradually carrying out this business.
    However, at present, there are still some erroneous ideas and practices among cadres and the masses in cooperatives in various regions. For example, some farmers and cadres excessively emphasize the credit sale of fertilizer by cooperatives; some regional cooperatives do not follow the principle of encouraging farmers to organize when supplying fertilizer; some do not conduct publicity to the masses first when supplying chemical fertilizer, and do not organize relevant departments to strengthen technical guidance on the application of chemical fertilizer, and so on. Cooperatives in various regions are paying attention to overcoming the above shortcomings.

    提高农田单位面积产量争取普遍丰收
    全国各地合作社大力供应肥料
    【本报讯】全国各地合作社准备了大量饼肥和化学肥料，有计划地供应农民今年生产的需要。中华全国合作总社在去年十二月所召开的大行政区（东北不在内）合作社肥料供应会议上，就提出了以国家一万五千亿元的贷款，完成供应肥料二百二十八万吨（内化学肥料二十八万吨）的总任务。这项肥料除一部分由东北调运供应各地外，绝大部分都由各地合作社自筹加工制造和采购。因此，各地人民政府都先后发出关于完成当地供肥任务的指示，合作社作出具体的采购、加工和供应计划，积极开展经营肥料的业务。目前从东北调进的肥料，已达全年应调拨的三分之一以上，并已陆续分运各地。到三月中旬止，各地自筹加工和采购的肥料，已完成全国合作总社所计划第一季度任务的百分之八十。同一期间，各大行政区完成季度计划的情况是：华东完成百分之八十七，华北完成百分之七十五，中南完成百分之九十二，西北完成百分之六十八，西南区完成这项任务的情况稍差。由于各地合作社业务日趋加强，估计第一季度的加工制造肥料和采购肥料的任务可以顺利完成。
    今年各地合作社计划供应的肥料都大大超过了去年。如陕西关中这个小麦、棉花重要产区，今年预计的供肥，超过去年的三倍半。西南全区合作社今年供应农民肥料，足够九百多万亩农田施基肥和追肥之用，大大超过去年供肥数量。这种情况，是随着农民施肥要求的提高而来的。华东各地农民积极响应政府提高单位面积产量的号召，生产情绪高涨，各地合作社充分准备肥料，如山东胶州等地已有追加供肥计划数的情形。浙江建德县，有百分之八十的农民已向合作社定购了肥料。
    各地合作社在开展供应肥料业务中，不断地批判了某些干部对供应肥料工作的错误认识，并帮助他们树立正确的思想。如有的干部曾错误地认为“合作社不必供肥，群众自会准备肥料”；“供肥是政府的事，与合作社无关”等。经过批评、教育，扭转思想，明确认识了供应肥料是保证农业增产的重要条件，并认识了开展供肥业务是可以发展、巩固合作社的。
    各地合作社供应肥料，主要采取以下三种办法：
    “存实预售”，即预约售给农民肥料，并预先吸收农民相当的实物；“现售”，即农民以现款购肥；“赊购”，即为了照顾去年受灾地区无力购买肥料的农民，合作社把肥料赊售他们，将来收回农产品。为了解决供肥资金不足的困难，今年各地合作社都提倡“存实预售肥料”的办法，华东苏南区等地积极推行这个办法，并创造了很好的经验。苏南合作社在去年十二月即发出指示，发动社员、非社员农民存储稻谷、黄豆、棉花三种实物，预购肥料。合作社对农民的存实，并按月付百分之一的利息。其他各地合作社也逐渐展开这项业务。
    但是，目前各地合作社的干部中和群众中，都还或多或少地有一些错误的想法和作法。如：有的农民和干部过分强调由合作社赊售肥料；有的地区合作社供应肥料时不依照鼓励农民组织起来的原则；有的在供应化学肥料时不先对群众进行宣传，不组织有关部门加强对施用化学肥料的技术指导工作等。对上述缺点，各地合作社都在注意克服。
