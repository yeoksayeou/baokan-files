Shanxi Province's Experience in Improving Irrigation Management and Enhancing Water Conservancy Efficiency
By our Special Correspondent Wu Guangtang

Xingxian and Xinxian Special Districts of Shanxi Province suffered severe droughts last year, and there has been very little rain or snow in the province this winter and spring. Strengthening drought prevention and resistance work has become a very important issue in this year's spring plowing campaign. The Government Administration Council's decision on drought prevention and resistance points out that fully achieving economical water use, cherishing water resources, and maximizing the irrigation efficiency of water are important measures for drought prevention and resistance. Over the past two years, Shanxi Province has made preliminary achievements in enhancing the irrigation efficiency of existing water conservancy projects by strengthening water management, abolishing the remaining feudal water regulations, and initially establishing a democratic, unified, and scientific irrigation management system. On the basis of existing canals, the irrigated area has been expanded by more than 400,000 mu, accounting for about 20% of the original canal irrigated area. At the same time, it has overcome the erroneous thinking of some cadres who "emphasize engineering and neglect management." The main experiences are as follows:

I. Implementing Democratic Management is a Prerequisite for Improving Irrigation

In the past, water conservancy management in Shanxi was dominated and monopolized by the landlord class. After the land reform, this situation was overturned. However, irrational management systems with feudal characteristics have not been completely changed, and in most areas, the canal headman system still exists. Water rights are manipulated by a few people, who enjoy special water use privileges. Due to poor management, there were also serious injustices and waste of manpower and resources in annual maintenance projects. Oppression, exploitation, and embezzlement were also very serious. The Zhao City Huoquan Canal wasted more than 1,000 shi of wheat a year under the pretext of worshipping "Darlang". The Xiahe Zhongsi Canal in Yuci wasted 800,000 jin of millet annually on canal headman wages and opera performances, in addition to annual maintenance projects. There was also the bad habit of downstream areas pleading to upstream areas, called "asking for upstream water," with downstream villages preparing "following-water meals," "thanking-water meals," and "canal-cleaning meals" every year. This was clearly a serious exploitation and waste of farmers. As a result, the Xiahe water fee burden was as high as three dou of millet per mu per year. This feudal management system seriously hindered the exertion of water conservancy power and affected the development of water conservancy. In response to these facts, we first educated the masses about the need to manage water conservancy themselves, and launched a campaign of complaining about the suffering endured by the masses under feudal control in the past, which raised the ideological awareness of the masses. On this basis, the water conservancy bureaus of various river systems, which were still controlled by a few people, were overthrown, the canal headman system and the "water dragon heads" and "water elders" who oppressed and exploited the masses were abolished, and water conservancy representatives supported by the beneficiaries (one person for every 50 to 100 households) were elected to form canal or county water conservancy representative conferences. The water conservancy committee is generated by the representative conference, responsible for the management of water conservancy work of this canal. The water conservancy representative conference is the highest authority of management in this canal, and it is also the link connecting the beneficiaries. Two years of experience have proved that the water conservancy representative conference is a good organizational form for managing water conservancy in a democratic way. At present, irrigation systems such as the Fen River, Xiahe River, Hutuo River, Yunzhong River, Muma River, Yangwu River, Longzisi, and Huoquan Canal, as well as 23 key counties such as Yuci, Linfen, and Dingxiang, have established water conservancy representative conferences. Some areas have held more than three meetings, and there are more than 4,000 county and canal water conservancy representatives, most of whom are enthusiastic water conservancy activists and water conservancy labor models who have contributed to and created water conservancy. They have become the vanguard of the new water conservancy and the backbone of leading the masses to do a good job in water conservancy. It is also precisely because of the adoption of the principle of democratic management of water conservancy that the ideological awareness of the masses has been raised, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses have been brought into play, and the foundation has been laid for unified management and unified water use. Water disputes have been greatly reduced. In Yuci Prefecture, 120 water conservancy disputes occurred before the reform, and only 16 occurred in 1951. In the Fen River in central Shanxi, 15 disputes occurred in 1950, and only 4 occurred in 1951, and all were resolved through consultation by water conservancy representatives. The concept of uniting to fight against water has also been initially established. The masses' love for canals has also formed a conscious action, and they have automatically formulated canal protection covenants, stipulating concrete measures such as not digging graves, not digging embankments, planting and protecting canal trees, protecting beach trees, and strengthening annual maintenance. These are all new phenomena after the implementation of democratic management.

II. Unified Management and Unified Water Use are the Basic Keys to Enhancing the Irrigation Efficiency of Existing Water Conservancy

Due to the extremely unreasonable division and segmentation of villages and sections caused by past feudal control, and the unfair distribution of water routes between upstream and downstream areas and beneficiary villages, great waste has been formed. Yangwu Village, which belongs to the Yangwu River in Guoxian County, has 2,000 mu of irrigated land and is allocated four days of water route. Nan Jia Village has 3,000 mu of irrigated land, but is only allocated one day of water route. Nantailin and Weijia Village, which have a total of 4,000 mu of irrigated land, are also only allocated one day of water route. The phenomenon of unreasonable allocation of water routes in other rivers, canals, and springs is also quite common. This inevitably leads to a situation where villages with more water routes waste a lot of water, while villages with fewer water routes do not have enough water for irrigation. The unreasonable water use methods left over from the era when the landlord class enjoyed special water use privileges are still used in some areas. Some villages still enjoy the special privilege of "three no-irrigation", that is, "no irrigation when it is windy, no irrigation when it is raining, and no irrigation at night." This naturally leads to a lot of waste. "Flying water" irrigation interspersed or water distribution by drawing lots and turning water back and forth between upstream and downstream areas waste even more water routes. In some flood canals, such as Hoduyu and Chakou, the unreasonable irrigation principle of "upstream first and downstream use" is still adopted, forming a situation where upstream villages irrigate continuously several times a year, while downstream villages do not get a chance to irrigate even once in three years. In order to reform these unreasonable water use systems and establish a reasonable and relatively scientific water use method, it is necessary to first formulate a unified management and unified use plan for the river system canals through the water conservancy representative conference, and mobilize the masses with the spirit of "farmers all over the world are one family" to overcome local selfishness and unique views on water rights. Propose the water use principle of "water belongs to the public, and water should be used to its full extent" (of course, historical considerations should be given priority). If necessary, partial unification can be implemented first in some areas to educate the masses with examples, and gradually achieve unification of the entire river system. Two years of experience have proved that the implementation of unified management can indeed enhance the irrigation efficiency of existing water conservancy projects. In 1950, Liu Changyi, a water conservancy labor model, took the lead in implementing unified management and unified water use in the Fen River irrigation canal, creating a method of breaking the boundaries of districts and villages, irrigating from high to low according to the terrain, turning from top to bottom, which greatly saved water routes, shortened the irrigation period, and expanded the irrigated area. In 1949, the Fen River irrigated only 500,000 mu, which increased to 700,000 mu in 1950, and further increased to 940,000 mu in 1951. After the unified water use of the South, North, and Middle three canals of the Huoquan Canal, the South Huo Canal used to be irrigated once every 36 days, but now it can be irrigated once every 18 days. The North Huo Canal used to be irrigated once every 45 days, but now it is irrigated once every 25 days. The Middle Huo Canal used to be able to irrigate only wheat fields, but now autumn fields also have water for irrigation. In the past, the three canals could only irrigate more than 50,000 mu of land, but in 1951, it has been expanded to 65,000 mu. In 1949, the Guanshen Canal in Xiahe River in Yuci failed to irrigate all the land in 60 days, but in 1951, after unified management, all the land was irrigated in 18 days. Zhangqing Canal only irrigated 3,000 mu of land in half a month in 1950, but after unified water use in 1951, it irrigated 4,540 mu in ten days. In the past, 18 villages in Yangwu River shared 50,000 mu of irrigated land and irrigated once every 30 days, but in 1951, all the land was irrigated in 22.5 days. The surplus water has added six new beneficiary villages, increasing the irrigated area by 16,000 mu. After the implementation of unified management, not only the irrigated area is expanded, but also the labor and materials for building embankments can be saved. In the irrigation history of the Fen River for hundreds of years, eight major embankments had to be built. After unified water use, only five major embankments were built. In 1951, two more major embankments were saved, saving a total of five major embankments, which can save 1.25 million jin of millet in embankment material prices every year and save 100,000 laborers. In the past, Yangwu River had to build 116 embankments every year, and after unified water use, at least half of them can be saved, saving 10,000 jin of millet in material costs and 15,000 laborers. In order to further implement unified management to achieve the purpose of water尽其用（make the best use of water）, the masses have created a contract system of unified water use and united irrigation between upstream and downstream areas and between left and right banks. Under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, democratic agreements were reached, and water use covenants were formulated, proposing various guarantees such as no stealing water, no wasting water, and no losing water, and stipulating water use disciplines that must be jointly observed. This is the best form for the masses to manage water conservancy, and it is also the most effective way to implement democratic management. At present, 15 canals such as Xiahe River and more than 50 villages have all signed covenants. However, it is not yet common throughout the province and should be well promoted. In addition, under the principle of unified water use, the village water conservancy representatives lead the formation of irrigation mutual aid groups according to the neighborhood, formulate irrigation covenants, and water conservancy managers patrol day and night to follow the water for irrigation. This is also an important guarantee for implementing unified water use.

III. Launching a Mass Campaign to Love and Conserve Water, and Gradually Achieving Rational Water Use, Can Greatly Increase the Irrigated Area

First of all, it is necessary to conduct scientific irrigation education among the masses and break the masses' erroneous thinking that "more irrigation is better." After the democratic reform of irrigation management, the masses began to obtain the right to use water freely from feudal control. The land that could not be irrigated in the past can now be irrigated, so a fairly common idea of irrigating as much as possible has emerged. For example, the masses in Xiahe River and other places said: "This time, we have to irrigate it hard!" When the water comes to their land, they try their best to irrigate as much as possible. This is a serious ideological obstacle to achieving rational water use. It is necessary to conduct in-depth education on scientific knowledge of water use to make the masses understand that excessive water use may destroy the structure of the soil, causing the original fertilizers in the soil to seep down with the water, reducing the fertility of the soil, and may even reduce the yield of crops. Moreover, excessive watering may raise the groundwater level, causing the soil to alkalize through capillary action and evaporation. And can carry out water demand comparison tests among the masses, to educate the masses with examples (such as can be tested separately according to crops, soil is better). After such education, a mass campaign to love and conserve water can be launched, and water love and conservation covenants can be formulated. At the same time, the masses should be universally mobilized to "level the fields and tidy the land, and divide ridges and embankments." At present, most of the paddy fields are uneven. Deep irrigation in low-lying areas may cause soil alkalization, while shallow irrigation in high-lying areas results in insufficient water in the soil, and crops cannot get proper nutrition, thus affecting the harvest. Due to the uneven land, there is also a phenomenon of blocking the water flow to force irrigation of high-lying land, resulting in waste of water and even loss of water and flooding, causing losses. To turn small ridges, repair more branch and channel, according to the amount of water and soil conditions, the general amount of water use is specified (some regulations do not exceed three inches), which are the problems that must be gradually solved. The masses in Fenhe River and Xiahe River have also created the principle of concentrating or dispersing water use according to the amount of water (when the amount of water is insufficient, the amount of water is allocated according to the method of "first green seedlings and then white land" and "first low-stalk crops and then high-stalk crops"). Xiwang Village in Jie County uses alternating furrow irrigation for cotton (that is, irrigating every other row according to the row spacing of cotton). According to their experience, this can double the paddy fields, and at the same time, there is no impact on the yield. There are also many places that implement the method of ditch irrigation, which can also save a lot of water. These are all good methods of rational water use and should be promoted. In addition, Qu Yaoli, a cotton high-yield model in Jie County, created the water use method of "frequent and little irrigation". Some areas implement a mixed irrigation method of deep wells and shallow wells, which can not only avoid alkalizing the land, but also save water. Rational water use is a very scientific work, and it is also an extremely meticulous organizational work, and the experience of the masses must be summarized at any time and gradually improved. We have specially trained more than 40 cadres to guide rational water use, which is also very important.

IV. Organizing Together to Use Water Wells Together and Installing Waterwheels Together Can Maximize the Irrigation Efficiency of Water Wells

According to the current experience in some areas, a single household using a well with a windlass can only irrigate 3 mu of land. Installing a waterwheel can irrigate 10 mu of land. If organized together, the car and well are not idle, and the irrigation is carried out day and night in shifts, which can irrigate 30 mu of land. If the water volume is sufficient, using large livestock to pull the waterwheel, plus rational water use, can also be expanded to 40 mu or even 50 mu. According to the experience in Yuncheng and other places, a waterwheel pulled by a cow can only irrigate 2.5 mu of land per day and night, while a waterwheel pulled by a mule or horse can irrigate 3.5 to 4 mu of land. This shows that changing to large livestock is also a very important condition for giving full play to the efficiency of water wells. The above facts fully show that organization is very important for the exertion of well water efficiency. At present, some of the waterwheel users promoted in Shanxi have not yet been organized, and 80,000 water wells in the province are still in the hands of individual households. If all are organized, at least 300,000 mu of land can be expanded. When organizing, the ownership of the original well owner and car owner must be taken care of, and methods such as shared use, shared repair, discounted shares, or giving remuneration should be adopted. Only by grasping the principle of mutual benefit can it help the development of waterwheels and water wells.

In short, democratic reforms must be implemented in irrigation management. Although Shanxi Province has made preliminary achievements in this regard, it has not done enough. On some canals, the old system has not been completely reformed, and rational water use has not been well implemented. In this year's large-scale drought prevention and resistance movement, we must vigorously promote this advanced irrigation management experience and strive to increase the irrigated area by one-fifth (increasing the irrigated area by 800,000 mu to 1 million mu) on the basis of the existing irrigated area by strengthening management, rational water use, and organizing to use waterwheels and water wells together. This will be an extremely important contribution to the people of the province. However, this task cannot be accomplished by a small number of water conservancy cadres alone. Party and government leading organs at all levels must give it sufficient attention, make plans according to the different conditions in each area, deeply mobilize the masses, and specifically organize and promote it in order to ensure the realization of this task.

    山西省改善灌溉管理发挥水利效能的经验
    本报特约记者  武光汤
    山西兴县、忻县两专区去年曾遭受严重旱灾，去冬今春全省雨雪甚少。加强防旱、抗旱工作已成为今年春耕运动中一个非常重要的问题。政务院关于防旱抗旱的决定中指出：充分做到经济用水、珍惜水量，发挥水的最大灌溉效能，是防旱、抗旱的重要措施之一。二年来山西省由于加强了水利管理，废除了残存的封建水规，初步地建立了民主的、统一的、科学的灌溉管理制度，在发挥现有水利的灌溉效能上，已做出初步成绩，在现有渠道的基础上，扩大了浇地面积四十余万亩，约占原有渠道灌溉面积百分之二十；同时也克服了某些干部的“重工程、轻管理”的错误思想。主要经验有以下几点：
    一、实行民主管理是改善灌溉的先决条件
    过去山西的水利管理，经过土地改革，由地主阶级把持独占的情形已经被推翻了；但带有封建性的不合理的管理制度，并未完全改变，大部地区仍然保留着渠长、甲头制，水权为少数人所操纵，享有使水特权。由于管理不善，在岁修工程上也有严重的不公和浪费人力物力的现象。压榨剥削、贪污自肥的现象也十分严重。赵城霍泉渠，藉口祭“大郎”，一年就浪费小麦一千多石。榆次潇河中四渠，每年除岁修工程外，仅渠长工资及唱戏等浪费就有八十万斤小米；且有下游请上游的陋习，名之曰“请上水头”，下游村庄每年都要准备“跟水饭”“谢水饭”“冼渠饭”。这显然是对农民严重的剥削和浪费现象。因此，潇河水费负担，每年每亩高达小米三斗。这种封建性的管理制度，严重地妨碍着水利力量的发挥，也影响着水利事业的发展。我们针对这些事实，首先在群众中进行了应该自己管理水利的教育，对过去在封建把持下群众所受的痛苦，开展了诉苦运动，提高了群众思想觉悟。在这个基础上，推翻了仍为少数人所把持的各河系水利局，废除了渠长、甲头制，及压榨剥削群众的“水龙头”“水老人”，由受益群众选举自己所拥护的水利代表（每五十户至一百户选一人），组成渠道或县水利代表会，由代表会产生水利委员会，负责管理本渠水利工作。水利代表会是本渠道管理的最高权力机关，又是联系受益群众的纽带。两年来的经验证明，水利代表会是用民主方式管理水利的很好的组织形式。目前汾河、潇河、滹沱河、云中河、牧马河、阳武河、龙子寺、霍泉渠等灌溉系统，及榆次、临汾、定襄等二十三个重点县，都已建立了水利代表会，有些地区已召开了三次以上的会议，县、渠水利代表已有四千多人，大部分是热心水利的积极分子和对水利有供献有创造的水利劳动模范。他们已成为新水利的先锋队和带动群众办好水利的骨干。也正由于采取民主管理水利的方针，因而提高了群众的思想觉悟，发挥了群众的积极性和创造性，给统一管理，统一使水打好了基础。争水纠纷已大大减少。榆次专区在未改革前水利纠纷发生一百二十件，一九五一年仅发生十六件；晋中汾河一九五○年发生纠纷十五件，一九五一年仅发生四件，而且都经过水利代表协商解决了。团结一致向水斗争的观念亦已初步树立起来。群众爱护渠道也形成自觉的行动，自动地订立了渠道护养公约，规定了不挖陵、不刨埝、栽护渠树、护滩树、加强岁修等具体办法。这都是实行民主管理以后的新气象。
    二、统一管理，统一使水，是发挥现有水利灌溉效能的基本关键
    由于过去封建把持所造成的极其不合理的分村分段割据，及上下游和受益村之间分配水程不公，形成极大的浪费。崞县阳武河属的阳武村，有水地两千亩，分配水程四天；南甲村有水地三千亩，只分配水程一天；南太林、魏家庄两村共有水地四千亩，也仅分得一天水程。其他河渠、泉泊分配水程不合理的现象，也相当普遍。这样，势必形成分配水程多的村大量浪费，分配少的村浇地不足的现象。过去地主阶级享有使水特权的时代所遗留下的不合理的使水方法，在若干地区也仍旧采用。某些村庄仍享有“三不浇”的特权，即“刮风不浇地，下雨不浇地，夜晚不浇地”。这自然形成很大浪费。插花“飞水”灌溉，或采用抽签轮水，使上下游往返调水，浪费水程更为严重。在若干洪水渠道上，如霍都峪、岔口等地，仍然采用着“上足下用”的不合理灌溉原则，形成上游村每年连续几次灌溉，下游村三年还轮不到一次。为了改革这些不合理的使水制度，建立合理的比较科学的使水方法，必须首先通过水利代表会，拟定河系渠道统一管理统一使用的计划，以“天下农民是一家”的精神动员群众，克服本位自私及水权特有的观点。提出“水归公有，水尽其用”的使水原则（当然应首先照顾历史）。必要时也可以先实行部分地区的统一，以实例教育群众，逐步地做到全河系的统一。两年来的经验证明，实行统一管理，确实可以发挥现有水利的灌溉效能。一九五○年汾河灌渠由水利劳动模范刘长义带头，首先实行了统一管理和统一使水，创造了打破区村地界，按地形地势，由高而低，上轮下至，顺水行浇的办法，大大地节省了水程，缩短了灌溉日期，扩大了灌溉面积。一九四九年汾河浇地仅五十万亩，一九五○年增浇到七十万亩，一九五一年又增浇到九十四万亩。霍泉渠南、北、中三条渠道统一使水后，南霍渠过去三十六天轮浇一次，现在十八天就能轮浇一次；北霍渠过去四十五天轮浇一次，现在二十五天轮一次。中霍渠过去只能浇麦地，现在秋田也有水灌溉了。过去三道渠只能浇地五万多亩，一九五一年已扩大到六万五千亩。榆次潇河官申渠在一九四九年六十天没浇完的土地，在一九五一年统一管理后，十八天就全部浇完了。张庆渠一九五○年在半个月内只浇了三千亩地，一九五一年统一使水后十天内就浇了四千五百四十亩。阳武河过去十八村共水地五万亩，三十天轮浇一次，一九五一年二十二天半就全部浇完；所节余的水量，又新增加六个受益村，共增浇地一万六千亩。实行统一管理后，不独扩大了灌溉面积，而且可以节省打埝工料。汾河几百年来的灌溉历史，都要打八大埝；统一使水后，只打了五大埝；一九五一年又省去两大埝，共省去五大埝，每年可节省筑埝料价小米一百二十五万斤，省民工十万个。阳武河过去每年须筑埝一百一十六条，统一使水后最少可以省去一半，可节省料费小米一万多斤，省工一万五千个。为了进一步贯彻统一管理达到水尽其用的目的，群众中又创造了上下游、左右岸统一使水团结灌溉的合同制，在自愿两利的原则下民主协议，订立了使水公约，提出不偷水、不浪费、不失水等各项保证，规定了共同遵守的使水纪律。这是群众管理水利的最好形式，也是贯彻民主管理最有效的办法。目前潇河等十五道渠及五十多个村，已全部订立了公约。但全省还不够普遍，应很好地推广。此外，各地在统一使水的原则下由各村水利代表领导按地邻组成浇地互助小组，订立浇地公约，并由水利管理员昼夜巡查，跟水行浇，也是贯彻统一使水的重要保证。
    三、开展群众性的爱水、节水运动，逐步实现合理用水，可以大量地增加灌溉面积
    首先要在群众中进行科学灌溉教育，打破群众认为“多浇就好”的错误思想。经过灌溉管理的民主改革之后，群众开始从封建把持下获得可以自由使水的权利，过去几年浇不上的地，现在可以灌溉了，因而相当普遍的产生了尽量多浇水的思想。如潇河等地群众说：“这一下可得狠狠地浇两水哩！”水轮到自己地里，便拚命多浇。这是实现合理用水的严重的思想障碍。必须深入进行使水的科学知识教育，使群众知道：使水过量可能破坏土壤的组织，使土壤内原有的肥料随水渗透下去，降低了土壤的肥沃性，反而可能减少作物的生产量；而且浇水过多可能使地下水位提高，经过毛细管吸力和蒸发作用使土地碱化。并可在群众中进行需水量对比试验，以实例教育群众（如能按作物、土壤分别试验更好）。经过这样的教育后，就可以开展群众性的爱水节水运动，订立爱水节水公约。同时应普遍发动群众“平田整地，划畦分埝”。现在水田大部凹凸不平，低处浇水过深，可能使土壤碱化；高处浇水过浅，土壤内水分不足，农作物不能得到适当的营养，因而影响收获。因土地不平，还有堵住水流逼浇高地的现象，以致浪费水量，甚至失水淹地造成损失。要化小甲埝，多修支毛斗渠，按水量及土壤情况规定一般使水数量（有的规定不超过三寸），都是必须逐步解决的问题。汾河、潇河等地群众并创造了根据水量大小，集中或分散使水的原则（水量不足时，按“先青苗后白地”“先低秆作物，后高秆作物”的办法分配水量）。解县西王村等地浇棉花采用隔沟浇水（就是按棉花的行距，隔一行浇一行的办法）。根据他们的经验，这样可以把水田扩大到一倍以上，同时对产量还没有影响。也有好些地方实行开沟浇地的办法，同样也能节省大量水程。这都是很好的合理用水的方法，应加以提倡。此外，解县棉花丰产模范曲耀离，创造了“勤浇少浇”的使水方法；若干地区实行深井、浅井混合灌溉的办法，不独可以避免碱化土地，而且可以节省水量。合理用水是非常科学的工作，也是极其细密的组织工作，必须随时总结群众的经验，逐步提高。我们曾专门训练了指导合理用水的干部四十多人，这也是很重要的。
    四、组织起来，合伙使用水井，合伙安装水车，可以发挥水井的灌溉效能
    根据目前若干地区的经验，单干户使用一眼辘轳水井，仅能浇地三亩。安上水车就可以浇地十亩。组织起来，车井不闲，昼夜轮浇，可浇地三十亩。如果水量充足，用大牲口拉水车，再加上合理用水，还可以扩大到四十亩甚至五十亩。运城等地的经验，用牛牵引水车，一昼夜只能浇地二亩半，用骡马牵引的水车，可浇地三亩半到四亩。这说明改换大牲畜也是充分发挥水井效能的十分重要的条件。上述事实充分说明，组织起来对于井水效用的发挥，关系是十分重大的。目前山西推广的水车的用户有一部分还没有组织起来，全省有八万眼水井还是掌握在单干户手里。如果全部组织起来，最低可扩大浇地三十万亩。在组织时，必须照顾原井主车主的所有权，采用伙使伙修、折价入股或给以报酬等办法。只有很好地掌握互助两利的原则，才能有助于水车、水井的发展。
    总之，在灌溉管理中必须实行民主改革。山西省在这方面虽已取得初步成绩，但还做得非常不够。在若干渠道上，旧的制度还没有完全改革，合理用水也还没有很好地贯彻。在今年大规模的防旱、抗旱运动中，要大力推广这一先进的灌溉管理经验，要求全省争取在现有灌溉面积的基础上，用加强管理、合理用水及组织起来伙用水车、水井等办法，做到增加浇地面积五分之一（增加浇地八十万亩到一百万亩）。这对全省人民将是一个极其重大的供献。但这一任务绝非少数水利干部所能完成，各地党、政领导机关必须予以足够重视，根据各地不同情况做出计划，深入发动群众，具体组织推动，才能保证这一任务的实现。
