Xinhua News Agency, March 15th:

    The "Investigative Group on American Imperialism's Germ Warfare Crimes," consisting of over fifty people (with over ten members having departed earlier), led by Head of the Group Li Dequan, Deputy Heads Liao Chengzhi and Chen Qiyuan, departed from Beijing at around 5 PM on the 15th to proceed to the Korean front lines and various regions of Northeast China to conduct investigative work. People from all circles in the capital held a grand send-off at the train station. Representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations in the capital attended the send-off, including Chen Shutong, Shen Junru, Ma Yinchu, Zhang Xiruo, Xie Juezai, Zhang Bojun, Zhu Xuefan, Shi Liang, Li Siguang, He Cheng, Fu Lianzhang, Su Jingguan, Xing Xiping, Zhang Youyu, Qian Sanqiang, Liu Guanyi, Nie Zhen, Qu Wu, Jin Baoshan, and Liao Mengxing, totaling over one hundred people. The Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, Kwon O-jik, also attended the send-off.

    At the meeting, Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairman of the China Peace Committee, delivered a brief farewell speech. He said: The inhuman atrocities of American imperialists in waging germ warfare are absolutely intolerable to the Korean people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world. We believe that all members of the "Investigative Group on American Imperialism's Germ Warfare Crimes," under the great trust of the people of the motherland, will surely successfully complete their mission, widely publicize the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism to the world, thoroughly expose the狰狞(zhengning) face and poisonous conspiracy of American imperialism, and let peace-loving people all over the world give the inhumane American imperialism a stern condemnation, and unite to stop this bloody atrocity.

    Subsequently, Li Dequan, Head of the "Investigative Group on American Imperialism's Germ Warfare Crimes," delivered a speech of thanks. She said: We respond to the call of the China Peace Committee and accept the great trust of the broad masses of people, rushing to the Korean front lines and various regions of Northeast China to conduct on-the-spot investigations into the crimes of American imperialism in waging germ warfare. This task is significant and solemn! We will work with the highest enthusiasm and resolutely complete this task! She said: Our investigation group includes representatives from various people's organizations and democratic parties across the country. Some of us come from relief organizations, some from women's, youth, workers', and students' organizations, and some from religious and scientific and literary organizations, including scholars and experts in bacteriology, entomology, international law, agronomy, medicine, and other fields. Based on our infinite love for our motherland, our infinite loyalty to our people's leader Chairman Mao Zedong, and our infinite sense of responsibility to world humanitarianism, no matter how high we climb, how deep we tread through the snow, or what difficulties we experience, we vow to investigate the evidence of the American murderers spreading germs and provide powerful evidence to further expose the brutal atrocities of American imperialism to the people of China and the world.
