    Oppose the Brutal Persecution of Our Captured Personnel by US-Chiang Kai-shek Secret Agents
    The countless atrocities committed by the American aggressors in killing and mistreating our captured personnel have long aroused the angry condemnation of the people of our country and peace-loving people around the world. However, the American aggressors not only show no sign of repentance, but recently they have even instructed a large number of secret agents dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs to use various cruel and shameless means to persecute our captured personnel in the US prisoner-of-war camps in Korea, attempting to detain our captured personnel and transfer them to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs. According to the Xinhua News Agency's Kaesong dispatch of the 12th, published in yesterday's newspaper, in the US prisoner-of-war camps in Korea, the American aggressors and the secret agents of the Chiang Kai-shek gang unscrupulously coerced our captured personnel to organize so-called "Anti-Communist and Resist Russia League," to sign so-called "voluntary repatriation" blood pledges, and forced them to tattoo their bodies, forced them to go on hunger strikes and write death notes, etc. These base, despicable, and madly shameless criminal activities cannot be concealed even in the reports of the reporters of the reactionary American newspapers and news agencies.
    This bloody criminal activity fully proves that behind the US aggressors' stubborn insistence on their absurd "voluntary repatriation" proposal on the issue of the release and repatriation of prisoners at the Korean armistice negotiations, there is an extremely vicious and ugly conspiracy hidden. On January 15th, the personnel of the Chiang gang's pseudo-embassy stationed in South Korea shamelessly and boastfully stated: "Once things are prepared, the vast majority of Communist Chinese prisoners of war will be willing to return to Nationalist China." The spokesman for the Syngman Rhee gang's Ministry of National Defense also openly admitted in an interview with Reuters reporters on February 22: "The South Korean government wants the United Nations to release 'democracy-inclined' civilians (referring to prisoners of the Korean People's Army) to supplement South Korea's manpower." All this shows that the purpose of the American aggressors instructing the secret agents of the Chiang and Rhee gangs to carry out criminal activities in the prisoner-of-war camps is precisely to forcibly send our captured personnel to the Chiang and Rhee gangs under the name of "voluntary repatriation." No lies of the American aggressors can cover up their sinister conspiracy.
    Obviously, this reckless and vile conspiracy of the American aggressors has already caused extremely serious threats to the ongoing Korean armistice negotiations. The US side's so-called absurd "voluntary repatriation" proposal has become one of the reefs hindering the progress of the negotiations, which is known to the world. In an article published in the "New York Herald Tribune" on February 28, the reactionary American journalist Walter Lippmann also had to admit that the US side's so-called absurd "voluntary repatriation" proposal "is legally untenable." The American aggressors' conspiracy to detain our captured personnel and transfer them to the Chiang and Rhee gangs is a complete violation of the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war. If the US side does not immediately stop their conspiracy and abandon their absurd "voluntary repatriation" proposal, they must bear the full responsibility for delaying and obstructing the Korean armistice negotiations.
    The people of our country will never allow the American aggressors' barbarous atrocities against our captured personnel to continue, and even more cannot tolerate the American aggressors sending our captured personnel to the hands of the Chiang and Rhee gangs under the name of "voluntary repatriation" to be persecuted and slaughtered. If the American aggressors still do not know repentance and continue to persecute our captured personnel, they will inevitably be severely punished by the people of our country and the peace-loving people of the world!

### 反对美蒋特务迫害我方被俘人员的暴行

    反对美蒋特务迫害我方被俘人员的暴行
    美国侵略者残杀和虐待我方被俘人员的罄竹难书的暴行，早已引起了我国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的愤怒指责，然而美国侵略者不但毫无悔祸的表现，近来他们竟又指使蒋介石和李承晚匪帮所派遣的大批特务分子，在朝鲜美方俘虏营中，用各种残忍无耻的手段迫害我方被俘人员，企图扣留我方被俘人员，转送给蒋介石和李承晚匪帮。根据昨日本报发表的新华社开城十二日电，在朝鲜的美方俘虏营中，美国侵略者和蒋介石匪帮的特务分子肆无忌惮地胁迫我被俘人员组织所谓“反共抗俄同盟”，签写所谓“自愿遣返”的血书，并强迫在我被俘人员身上刺字，强迫绝食和写绝命书等等。这些卑鄙龌龊、疯狂无耻的罪恶活动，在美国反动报刊和通讯社的记者们的报道中也都无法隐讳了。
    这种血淋淋的罪恶活动，完全证明美国侵略者在朝鲜停战谈判会议上对俘虏的释放与遣返问题蛮横无理地坚持其“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张的背后，是隐藏着极端狠毒和丑恶的阴谋的。一月十五日蒋匪驻南朝鲜的伪使馆人员曾得意忘形地无耻表示：“一俟事情准备停当，绝大部分共产党中国战俘都愿意回到国民党中国境内”。李承晚匪帮的国防部发言人在二月二十二日对路透社记者发表的谈话中，也公开供认：“南朝鲜政府要联合国释放‘倾向民主’的平民（指朝鲜人民军被俘人员）以补充南朝鲜的人力”。这些都说明了美国侵略者指使蒋李匪帮的特务分子在俘虏营中进行罪恶活动的目的，正是为了在“自愿遣返”的名义下将我方被俘人员强迫送交蒋李匪帮。美国侵略者的任何谎言，也掩盖不了他们的险恶阴谋了。
    显然的，美国侵略者这种不计后果的卑劣阴谋，已经使正在进行中的朝鲜停战谈判遭受到极其严重的威胁。美方的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，已经成为阻碍谈判进展的礁石之一，这是举世周知的。美国反动记者李普曼于二月二十八日在“纽约先驱论坛报”上发表的文章中，也不得不承认美方的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张“在法律上是站不住脚的”。美国侵略者企图扣留我方被俘人员并把他们转送给蒋李匪帮的阴谋活动，完全违反了关于俘虏问题的日内瓦公约。如果美方不立即停止他们的阴谋活动，并放弃他们“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，他们就必须担负拖延和阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的全部责任。
    我国人民绝不容许美国侵略者对我方被俘人员的野蛮暴行继续下去，更不能容忍美国侵略者在“自愿遣返”的名义下将我方被俘人员送到蒋李匪帮手中加以迫害和屠杀。美国侵略者如果仍然不知悔祸，对我被俘人员继续进行迫害的话，就必然要受到我国人民和世界爱好和平人民的严厉惩罚！
