(Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd) A gathering was held last night in Beijing by legal workers and representatives from all circles of the people to welcome the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team sent to Korea to investigate the atrocities of the American aggressors, as well as Cai Guiheng, Deputy Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Procuratorate of Korea, who came to China with the investigation team. The welcoming meeting was presided over by the preparatory committee of the China Political Science and Law Society.

Among those attending the welcoming meeting were over 600 legal workers from the capital, representatives of people's organizations, professors, scholars, experts, and health and medical workers, including Shen Junru, Xie Juezai, Chen Shutong, Ma Yinchu, He Cheng, Shi Liang, Lan Gongwu, Zhang Zhiran, Zhang Xiruo, Qian Junrui, Qian Duansheng, Wu Gaizhi, Hu Yuzhi, Sa Kongliao, Lei Jieqiong, Lou Bangyan, Shen Zijiu, and Liao Mengxing.

The International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team, headed by Brandweiner, Professor of Law from Austria, and Cai Guiheng, Deputy Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Procuratorate of Korea, entered the venue amidst applause.

After the welcoming meeting began, Shen Junru, a member of the preparatory committee of the China Political Science and Law Society and Vice President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, delivered a welcoming speech. He first expressed his gratitude and admiration on behalf of the Chinese legal workers to the investigation team for their hard work in conducting investigations for world peace and human safety. He pointed out that the US imperialists' germ warfare is a serious threat to all mankind. Peace-loving people all over the world must unite to vigorously stop this heinous crime. The investigation in Korea and the impact of the investigation results will be an important factor in stopping this crime. The investigation team will soon go to Northeast China for investigation, which will contribute more to stopping this crime.

Brandweiner, the head of the investigation team and professor of law from Austria, delivered a speech. He said that the investigation team investigated the fact that the US military conducted germ warfare in Korea and has obtained irrefutable evidence. He pointed out that the actions of the American aggressors violated the Hague Convention and the Geneva Protocol, and violated the declaration of the World Peace Congress representing the peace-loving people of the world. The American crime is a crime against all mankind. He concluded by saying: We hope that our investigation will contribute to the struggle of the Korean and Chinese people for peace, freedom and justice.

The deputy head of the investigation team, Cavalieri, a well-known Italian lawyer, reported in detail on the facts of the use of poison gas by the American aggressor army in his speech. He pointed out that the American aggressor army not only used poison gas but also used bacteriological weapons against the peaceful people. He said that this crime of the American aggressors should be exposed to the world, and a court should be set up to try those who violated international law.

Dibrito, a Brazilian professor of law and member of the investigation team, strongly condemned the US imperialist aggression against Korea and the criminal acts of using poison gas and bacteriological weapons in his speech. He pointed out that the future of mankind is now threatened, and democratic legal workers must unite the people of the world and fight for peace.

The British lawyer Gaster delivered a moving speech. He said: I saw many terrible and barbaric atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea, but it is not enough to just see them. Only when the people of the world rise up to stop the hands of the murderers, otherwise terror and barbarism will expand. We must actively fight to defend peace.

The French lawyer, Jasgay, said that the crimes of the American aggressors not only violated international law but also violated the conscience of the world. The whole world is now under threat, and after I return to France, I will report what I have seen and confirmed to all honest people.

Mrs. Molens, a Belgian lawyer, reported on the stark contrast she saw in Korea: the barbarity and cruelty of the American aggressors and the care and concern of the Korean government for the people. She praised the courage and optimism of the Korean people and pointed out that such people are bound to win.

Mrs. Vasilkovska, a Polish legal worker, paid tribute to the Chinese people on behalf of Polish legal workers and Polish women, and protested against the crimes of the American aggressors. She said that the American aggressors will surely be defeated by the united strength of the people of all countries, and the war criminals will be justly punished in front of the people's court.

Cai Guiheng, Deputy Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Procuratorate of Korea, spoke last. He pointed out that in order to conquer the Korean people, US imperialism carried out cruel destruction and massacres, but the Korean people were not conquered. Therefore, it violated international law and humanitarianism, and used poison gas and bacteria. However, even so, the Korean people are still unconquerable. The Korean people, closely united around General Kim Il-sung, will surely win the final victory.

The welcoming meeting ended in warm applause. After the meeting, the Central Academy of Drama's affiliated Song and Dance Theater performed entertainment programs to entertain the investigation team. The investigation team is about to go to the Northeast to investigate the crimes of the American aggressors using bacteriological weapons against the Chinese people.

    欢迎会开始后，中国政治法律学会筹备会筹备委员、国际民主法律工作者协会副主席沈钧儒致欢迎词。他首先代表中国法律工作者对调查团为了世界和平与人类安全，不辞艰苦进行调查，表示感谢和崇敬。他指出：美帝国主义进行细菌战，是对全人类的一个严重威胁。全世界爱好和平的人民必须一致起来大力制止这种滔天罪行。调查团在朝鲜的调查和调查结果所将发生的影响，就是制止这种罪行的一个重要的因素。调查团即将前往我国东北调查，这对于制止这种罪行，将有更多的贡献。
    调查团团长、奥地利法学教授布兰德魏纳致词。他说：调查团在朝鲜就美军进行细菌战的事实进行了调查，并已经得到了不可辩驳的证据。他指出：美国侵略者的这种行为违反了海牙公约和日内瓦议定书，违反了代表全世界爱好和平的人民的世界保卫和平大会的宣言。美国的这种罪行是对全人类犯下的罪行。他最后说：我们希望我们的调查，会对朝中人民的为和平、自由和正义的斗争有所贡献。
    调查团副团长、意大利著名律师卡瓦莱里在讲话中详细地报告了美国侵略军使用毒气的事实。他指出：美国侵略军不仅使用毒气而且还使用细菌武器对付和平人民。他说：应该向全世界揭露美国侵略者的这种罪行，并设立法庭来审判这些违反国际法的人。
    调查团团员、巴西法学教授狄布里托在讲话中痛斥美帝国主义侵略朝鲜、使用毒气和细菌武器的罪恶行为。他指出：现在人类前途遭受了威胁，民主法律工作者必须团结全世界人民，为和平而斗争。
    英国律师加斯特尔发表了动人的演说。他说：我在朝鲜看到了美国侵略者的许多恐怖、野蛮的兽行，但仅仅看到是不够的，只有全世界人民起来制止杀人犯的手，否则恐怖和野蛮是要扩大的。我们必须积极地为保卫和平而斗争。

    波兰法律工作者华西尔考夫斯卡夫人代表波兰法律工作者和波兰妇女向中国人民致敬，并对美国侵略者的罪行表示抗议。她说：美国侵略者一定会被各国人民的团结力量击败，战争罪犯必将在正义的人民法庭前受到应得的惩罚。
    朝鲜最高检察所副检察总长蔡圭亨最后讲话。他指出：美帝国主义为了想征服朝鲜人民，进行了残酷的破坏和屠杀，但是朝鲜人民没有被征服。于是，它违反国际法、违反人道，使用了毒气和细菌。可是，就是这样，朝鲜人民也还是不可被征服的。朝鲜人民紧密地团结在金日成将军的周围，一定要争取最后的胜利。
    欢迎会在热烈的掌声中结束。会后，由中央戏剧学院附属歌舞剧院演出文娱节目招待调查团。调查团即将前往东北，调查美国侵略者对中国人民使用细菌武器的罪行。
