    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 14th: At the fourth agenda item subcommittee of the Korean armistice negotiations on March 14th, our representative reiterated our position: both sides should, based on the exchanged prisoner-of-war materials, determine fair and reasonable principles for releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war held by both sides, and then hand them over to the staff to discuss and resolve existing differences based on the determined principles.
    At the third agenda's staff meeting, the other side continued to insist on unreasonable demands regarding the nomination of neutral nations, the issue of rotation and ports of entry, and the inspection powers of neutral nation teams. In order to promote the progress of the meeting, our side suggested that both sides first resolve all minor issues other than the three major differences. However, the other side not only openly refused to resolve the issues recognized by both sides as easy to solve all at once, but the other side's chief staff officer, Colonel Kinney, even adopted an extremely unserious attitude, recklessly treating the negotiation meeting as child's play, even smugly instructing the other side's interpreter to deliberately joke around, using individual, seemingly understandable Russian words instead of Korean when translating to me. Our chief staff officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, denounced the other side's irresponsible attitude of refusing to solve the problem, and demanded on the spot that Colonel Kinney retract this rude behavior, and sternly pointed out that the other side must bear all responsibility for delaying or even undermining the armistice negotiations.

    朝鲜谈判第三项议程参谋会上
    我痛斥美方无礼态度
    【新华社开城十四日电】三月十四日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程小组委员会上，我方代表重申我方立场：双方应根据已经交换的战俘材料，确定释放并遣返双方所收容的全部战俘的、公平合理的原则，然后交由参谋人员根据已经确定的原则来讨论并解决现存的分歧。
    第三项议程参谋会议上，对方仍然坚持在中立国提名问题、轮换与口岸问题以及中立国小组视察权力问题上的无理主张。我方为促进会议的进展，建议双方首先解决三大分歧以外的各项次要问题。但对方不但公开拒绝将双方公认为容易解决的问题首先一并予以解决，对方首席参谋肯尼上校更采取了极端不严肃的态度，放肆地将谈判会议视同儿戏，甚至于自鸣得意地指使对方译员有意开玩笑，在向我翻译时，不使用朝中文而使用个别的似通非通的俄文字眼。我方首席参谋张春山上校痛斥对方这种拒绝解决问题不负责任的态度，当场要求肯尼上校收回这种无礼行为，并严词指出对方必须负担一切拖延乃至于破坏停战谈判的责任。
