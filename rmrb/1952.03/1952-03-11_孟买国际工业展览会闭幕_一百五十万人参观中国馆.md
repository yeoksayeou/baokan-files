Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 10th -- The International Industrial Exhibition, which opened in Bombay on January 11th this year, closed on February 24th. During these forty-five days, tens of thousands of residents from Bombay and other places came to visit. The pavilions of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary displayed the achievements of peaceful construction and the happy lives of the people in these four countries. These have become topics of widespread and enthusiastic discussion among the people and newspapers throughout India.

A total of 1.5 million people from all walks of life in India visited the Chinese Pavilion, including senior officials of the Indian government, leaders of political parties, peace movement organizations, trade unions, farmers' associations, and mass organizations, as well as scientists, economists, writers, and business leaders and entrepreneurs.

Indian newspapers believe that the International Industrial Exhibition is an important step towards improving international trade relations and strengthening friendship and mutual understanding between the Indian people and the peoples of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other countries participating in the exhibition. The Hindi weekly "New Dawn" in Lucknow called the exhibition "an exhibition of the new world." The newspaper said: "The time has come to no longer submit to the shameful conditions imposed on us by the imperialists. We will import our necessities from those countries that are willing to supply us with materials on an equal footing."

    孟买国际工业展览会闭幕
    一百五十万人参观中国馆
    【新华社新德里十日电】今年一月十一日在孟买开幕的国际工业展览会，已在二月二十四日闭幕。在这四十五天中，有成千成万的孟买和其他地方的居民前来参观。展览会中苏联、中华人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利的展览馆，显示了这四个国家的和平建设的成就和人民的幸福生活。这些都成了印度各地人民和报纸的广泛而热烈的讨论的题目。
    参观中国馆的印度各界人士共达一百五十万人，其中包括：印度政府的高级官员，政党、和平运动组织、工会、农会和群众组织的领袖，科学家，经济学家，作家，以及工商界领袖和企业家。
    印度报纸认为：国际工业展览会是走向改善国际贸易关系及加强印度人民和苏联、中华人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利以及参加这次展览会的其他各国人民之间的友谊和相互了解的重要步骤。勒克瑙的印地语周报“新黎明报”把这次展览会称为“新世界的展览会”。该报说：“不再屈服在帝国主义者强加在我们身上的可耻条件之下的时候到了。我们将从那些愿意在平等的基础上供给我们物资的国家输入我们的必需品。”
