American Aggressors Violate All
Principles of International Law
Huaxierkaofusika
The great Chinese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, have shaken off the shackles of imperialism and built a new life without oppression. On behalf of Polish legal workers and Polish women, I express our most sincere respect to the great Chinese people.

In Korea, we have investigated the bloody crimes of the American aggressors. The American aggressors are systematically and planfully slaughtering the Korean people. For freedom and to stop imperialist aggression, the Korean people are bravely fighting the enemy.

All the evil deeds of the American aggressors in Korea have long been known to the world. But recently, they have committed new heinous crimes by using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.

This heinous crime has aroused the boundless anger of good men and women all over the world. In Poland, workers, farmers, scientists, women, and youth have all held rallies to express their strong protest against this unprecedented crime.

Progressive scientists in various countries are working hard to save mankind from the scourge of infectious diseases, and their work has achieved great success. However, American "science" is spreading infectious disease bacteria to eliminate mankind. The American aggressors have openly done the evil deeds that the Hitler criminals did not dare to try lightly.

Polish legal workers support the tide of protest against this heinous crime. We believe that this crime violates all principles of international law. This is a heinous crime of destroying humanity.

We have personally witnessed the inhuman crimes of the American aggressors in Korea, especially their large-scale massacres of women and children. I have spoken with mothers who watched their children being murdered by brutal American executioners. I have also spoken with women whose hair turned white in a very short time due to the suffering they endured. These women not only told me about their suffering, but also about their indomitable struggle experience. The example of these heroic women tells us that American imperialists will never achieve their goals, and victory will surely belong to the Korean people and progressive mankind throughout the world.

Millions of women in various countries are also rising up more and more resolutely to fight for peace and the happiness of their people.

The entire progressive world unanimously condemns the shameful crimes of the American aggressors, demands a ban on bacteriological warfare, and stops the heinous crimes of the American aggressors. We firmly believe that the criminals will be punished as they deserve under the severe sanctions of the people of all countries.

    美国侵略者违反了一切
    国际法律的原则
    华西尔考夫斯卡
    伟大的中国人民在英明的毛泽东主席领导下，摆脱了帝国主义的枷锁，建设了没有压迫的新生活。我代表波兰法律工作者和波兰妇女，向伟大的中国人民表示我们最诚挚的敬意。
    在朝鲜，我们对美国侵略者的血腥罪行进行了调查。美国侵略者是在有系统、有计划地屠杀朝鲜人民。为了自由，为了制止帝国主义的侵略，朝鲜人民正在英勇地对敌人作战。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜的一切罪恶行为，早就为世人所知。但最近他们竟又在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器，犯下了新的滔天罪行。
    这一滔天罪行，激起了全世界善良男女的无比愤怒。在波兰，工人、农民、科学家、妇女和青年都纷纷举行集会，对这史无前例的罪行表示强烈的抗议。
    各国进步科学家都在努力工作，要把人类从传染病的灾祸里拯救出来，他们的工作已获得很大的成就。但是，美国“科学”却在散布传染病细菌，要把人类消灭。希特勒罪犯所不敢轻于尝试的罪恶勾当，美国侵略者竟公然做出来了。
    波兰法律工作者拥护对这一滔天罪行的抗议怒潮。我们认为这种罪行违反一切国际法律的原则。这是毁灭人类的滔天罪行。
    我们在朝鲜亲眼看到了美国侵略者绝灭人性的罪行，特别是他们对妇女和儿童的大规模屠杀。我曾和一些母亲谈过话，她们眼看着她们的孩子被残暴的美国刽子手杀害。我也曾和一些妇女谈过话，由于她们所遭受的痛苦，她们的头发在很短时间内就变白了。这些妇女不但和我谈了她们的痛苦，并且还和我谈了她们不屈不挠的斗争经验。这些英雄妇女的榜样告诉我们，美帝国主义者永远不能达到他们的目的，胜利一定属于朝鲜人民和全世界的进步人类。
    各国千百万妇女也一天比一天坚决地起来为和平和本国人民的幸福而进行斗争。
    整个进步世界都一致谴责美国侵略者的可耻罪行，要求禁止细菌战争，并制止美国侵略者的滔天罪行。我们深信罪犯们一定会在各国人民严厉的制裁下，受到他们应得的惩罚。
