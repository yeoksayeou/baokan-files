The role of Bolshevik publications is enormous, and the task they bear is glorious. They instill the thoughts of Lenin and Stalin into the masses, daily propagating the policies of the Bolshevik Party, which constitute the foundation of the Soviet system's life. Our newspapers, periodicals, and books actively assist the Party in resolving the enormous and complex tasks of economic and cultural construction, and in educating the working people in the spirit of communism.

Bolshevik publications are powerful due to their ideological nature and their connection with the masses. The Soviet people exchange ideas and production experiences in newspapers and periodicals, obtain answers to pressing questions about domestic and foreign life, and offer opinions on improving our public services, criticizing various shortcomings. The number of books written by new authors—workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals—increases year by year. The wider the range of writing activists a publishing institution encompasses, the more fruitful its work, the clearer its purpose, and the more consolidated its connection with life.

As early as when founding Bolshevik newspapers, Lenin particularly forcefully emphasized: "Only when every five leading and regularly writing writers are accompanied by five hundred and five thousand non-writing workers will the publishing institution become active and full of life." The widespread participation of the working people in newspaper and periodical work is a characteristic and excellent tradition of the new type of publications created by the Lenin-Stalin Party.

Making every effort to expand the scope of writing activists and maintaining regular working contact with them is a necessary condition for improving the quality of every newspaper, periodical, and book. Only by absorbing outstanding propagandists to participate in the work can the editorial department greatly improve the ideological and theoretical level of the materials it publishes; only when the leaders of Party organizations and Party activists regularly participate in the work of publishing institutions can the publishing institutions better elucidate the life of the Party; the success of publicizing advanced experiences and scientific achievements depends on whether the editorial department's connection with Stakhanovite workers in industry and transportation, socialist agricultural technicians, and scientific workers is close. It is obvious that the works written by participants in communist construction and their advanced figures themselves, about the labor achievements of the great builders of communism, can be narrated vividly, interestingly, and educationally.

Facts have proven that only by relying on the help of activists can central and local publications better and more fully meet the needs of readers. Now, the initiators of new Stakhanovite work methods frequently express their opinions in many newspapers: their experiences have become the property of millions of working people with the support of the press. In terms of agricultural economy, the publicity of advanced experiences has also been improved. Our newspapers have begun to pay more attention to issues of production organization in collective farms and state farms, and more attention to issues such as increasing farmland yields and developing public animal husbandry.

Our country has thousands of newspapers, hundreds of different periodicals, and many publishing bureaus that publish political, artistic, production technology, scientific, and educational books. Each publishing institution and each publishing bureau has its own characteristics, but in any case, they have a common and unbreakable principle: relying on writing activists and extensively absorbing them to participate in editorial work. When preparing to publish various important materials, not only should the experience and opinions of individual readers be taken into account, but also the experience, knowledge, and opinions of collective and broad readers.

Comrade Stalin called on us to be sensitive to the opinions of the masses, and we should not only teach the masses but also learn from them. Comrade Stalin said: "Indeed, millions of laborers, workers, and peasants are working, living, and struggling. They are not living in vain. When they live and struggle, they naturally accumulate a wealth of practical experience - who can doubt this? Leaders who ignore this practical experience cannot be regarded as true leaders - can this be doubted?"

Bolshevik publications are a new type of publication, representing the interests of the people, conducting all their business with the active participation of the broad masses of the people in order to meet the people's spiritual needs. This explains why the lack of contact between editorial departments and activists is not a general shortcoming but a violation of the principles of Bolshevik publications.

If many publishing institutions have achieved success in their business, it is because they have established extensive contact with writing activists. The low level of work of other publishing institutions and publishing bureaus is due to a lack of contact with the broad readership. For example, the work of the editorial department of the literary journal of the Writers Association of the Turkmen Republic is divorced from young writers, and thus it feels a great lack of essays, novels, and book reviews. The staff of the Karelian-Finnish Republic Writers Association's organ publication "On the Border" constantly complains about the lack of materials, but in these republics there are a large number of new literary forces, hundreds and thousands of Stakhanovite workers, experts, and scientists, who have materials to tell readers about.

Our people are talented. People who can write can be found not only within the circle of professional literary workers. With proper assistance, it will be easy to find contributors to newspapers and periodicals, authors of books - advanced producers in urban and rural areas, workers, and representatives of the intellectual class of all nationalities. The duty of editors and publishing bureau workers is to discover these people, care about and pay attention to their proposals, and help them in their creative activities.

Truly helping writers does not mean printing any article quickly, because some of them are clumsy and crudely written. The mutual relationship between the editorial department and the author should be based on the principle of constantly caring about the high ideological, artistic, and scientific level of the works being prepared for publication. In order to accomplish this task, high demands must be made on the authors, and they must be contacted persistently and creatively.

Regrettably, some editorial departments do not pay enough attention to maintaining regular working contact with authors. For example, why have teachers in Belarus stopped writing for their own publication "Soviet School"? This is primarily because the editorial department and the authors have not adjusted their mutual relationship correctly. The editorial department gave the authors formalistic and incomprehensible replies, and at the same time, without the authors' consent, arbitrarily deleted and revised their manuscripts.

Improving working relationships with authors is a guarantee for improving the level of all business in newspapers, periodicals, and publishing bureaus. At the same time, it is also necessary to absorb the broad readership to participate in discussions of various issues in editorial work. Cultural workers, scientists, writers, Stakhanovite workers, and innovators of collective farms are ideal figures in editorial departments. When discussing plans, they can provide valuable opinions and raise new topics and important issues in life. Their opinions are also worth considering when discussing manuscripts and determining the basic direction of editorial work.

The editorial departments of many periodicals, especially various publishing bureaus, have not established close contact with the scientific community and writers. For example, the basic shortcoming of the work of the Tashkent State Publishing Bureau is its detachment from the broad readership in the country; when discussing publication plans and manuscripts of various authors, it almost never convenes meetings with local writers, scientists, and production workers. The activities of the editorial committee of the Tashkent Publishing Bureau have long ceased, and critics and translators have lost interest in publishing.

The magnitude of domestic construction and the high degree of creative display by the people provide unlimited possibilities for publicizing everything new and advanced; the duty of Party organizations is to fully utilize these possibilities in order to create an environment in various editorial departments and publishing bureaus; under this environment, it is considered an important political task to establish working contact with writing activists. Party organizations are constantly concerned that all newspapers and periodicals and all publishing bureaus must rely on the help and support of the broad readership in their business.

Consolidating contact with activists and uniting the advanced figures of industry, agriculture, science, and art around the editorial departments and publishing bureaus is an important condition for further promoting ideological work and improving the role of our publications in the cause of communist education for the working people.

    苏联出版物的优良传统
    ——苏联真理报一九五二年一月五日社论
    布尔什维克出版物所起的作用是巨大的，所负的任务是光荣的。它把列宁、斯大林的思想灌输到群众中去，每日在宣传着构成苏维埃制度的生活基础的布尔什维克党的政策。我国的报纸、刊物、图书积极地帮助党解决经济文化建设上的巨大而复杂的任务，以共产主义的精神来教育劳动人民。
    布尔什维克的出版物，由于它的思想性和与群众的联系而有力。苏联人民在报纸刊物上交换思想和生产经验，获得关于国内外生活的迫切问题的解答，并对改善我国公共事业提出意见，对各项缺点进行批评。新的著作者——工人、集体农民和知识分子所写成的书本的数量逐年增加。任何一个出版机构的写作积极分子包罗的范围愈广泛，它的业务就愈有成果，目的性也就愈明确，它和生活的联系也就更加巩固。
    列宁早在创办布尔什维克报纸的时候，就曾特别有力地强调过：“只有在每有五个领导的和经常写作的作家，就同时有五百个和五千个非作家的工作人员的时候，出版机构就将要活跃起来，富有生命力了。”劳动人民广泛地参加报刊工作，是列宁—斯大林党所创造的新型出版物的特征和优良传统。
    多方设法扩大写作积极分子的范围，和他们保持工作上的经常联系，这是每种报纸、刊物、图书提高质量的必要条件。编辑部吸收了卓越的宣传人员来参加工作，才能大大地提高它所发表的材料的思想理论水平；只有当党组织的领导人、党的积极分子正规地参加出版机构的工作时，出版机构才善于更好地阐明党的生活；宣传先进经验和科学成就的成功，有赖于编辑部与工业和运输业的斯达哈诺夫式工作者、社会主义农业技工及科学工作者的联系是否密切。很显然，共产主义建设参加者及其先进人物自己写的有关共产主义伟大建设者的劳动功绩的著作，是可以叙述得很生动有趣，很有教育意义的。
    事实证明：只有依赖积极分子的帮助，中央及地方出版物才能更好而充分地满足读者的需要。现在斯达哈诺夫新工作方法的首创者在许多报上经常发表意见：他们的经验是在报刊的支持下成为千百万劳动人民的财产。在农业经济方面，关于先进经验的宣传也得到了改善，我们的报纸开始更多注意到集体农庄和国营农场生产组织上的问题，更多注意到提高农田收获量和发展公共畜牧业等方面的问题。
    我国有数千种报纸，数百种不同的刊物，有出版政治、艺术、生产技术、科学、教育等书籍的许多出版局。每一出版机构，每一出版局都有它们的工作特点，但无论如何，它们有一个共同的牢不可破的原则，那就是：依靠写作积极分子，广泛地吸收他们参加编辑业务。在准备出版各项重要材料时，不仅应估计到个别读者的经验和意见，而且也应估计到集体的、广大读者的经验、知识和意见。
    斯大林同志号召我们敏感地倾听群众的意见，我们不仅应当教导群众，而且还应当向群众学习。斯大林同志说：“的确，千百万劳动者，工人和农民，是在劳动着，生活着，奋斗着。他们并不是白白生活着，他们生活奋斗时，当然也就积蓄着很丰富的实践经验——这一点有谁能够怀疑呢？忽视这种实践经验的领导者，决不能算作真正的领导者——这一点难道可以怀疑么？”
    布尔什维克出版物是新型的出版物，是代表人民的利益，为满足人民精神上的需要，在广大人民群众积极参加之下进行自己的全部业务的。这就可以说明：为什么编辑部门缺乏和积极分子的联系，不是一般性的缺点，而是违背了布尔什维克出版物的原则的。
    如果说有许多出版机构的业务已经取得成绩的话，那就是由于它们和写作积极分子取得了广泛的联系。而另外一些出版机构及出版局工作水平之所以低，就是由于缺乏和广大读者保持联系。例如，土库曼共和国作家协会文学期刊编辑部的工作就是脱离了青年作家，于是才感到小品文、小说及书评文章的非常缺乏。卡累里阿·芬兰共和国作家协会的机关刊物“在国境上”的工作人员对于材料的缺乏经常叫苦，然而在这些共和国内是有大批的文学生力军的，那里有成百成千个斯达哈诺夫式工作者、专家和科学家，他们是有材料向读者们叙述的。
    我国人民是富有天才的。不限于在职业文艺工作者的圈子里可以找到写作的人。只要有适当的帮助，就会顺利地找到报纸和刊物的撰稿者，图书的著作者——城乡先进生产者、劳动者、各民族的知识阶层的代表人物。编辑部和出版局工作者的义务是发现这些人物，关心并注意对待他们的提议，在创作活动中帮助他们。
    真正地帮助作家们并不是要把任何文章很快地都给刊印出来，因为其中也有一些拙劣的、写得很粗糙的文章。编辑部和作者的相互关系应当以经常关心准备出版的作品的高度思想水平艺术水平及科学水平为准则。为了完成这项任务，必须对作者提出高度的要求，要坚持地富有创造性地和他们联系。
    很惋惜，有一些编辑部对于和著作者保持经常的工作联系这一点，不够注意。例如，白俄罗斯的教员们为什么停止给他们自己的刊物“苏维埃学校”写稿呢？这首先就是由于编辑部和作者没有调整正确的相互关系的缘故。该刊编辑部曾给予作者以形式主义的、难以理解的回答，同时不得到作者的同意，就擅自删改他们的原稿。
    改善和作者的工作关系是提高报纸、刊物及出版局全部业务水平的保证。同时也必须吸收广大读者来参加讨论编辑工作中的各项问题。文化工作者、科学家、作家、斯达哈诺夫式工作者及集体农庄的革新者都是编辑部门的理想人物。当讨论计划时，他们能提供宝贵的意见，提出新的题材及生活上的重要问题。当讨论原稿，确定编辑工作的基本方向时，他们的意见也是值得重视的。
    有许多刊物的编辑部，尤其是各出版局，和科学界及作家们没有取得密切的联系。例如，塔什克国家出版局工作的基本缺点是脱离国内的广大读者；它在讨论出版计划及各个作者的原稿时，几乎从来没有召集过当地作家、科学家及生产工作者开过会。塔什克出版局编辑委员会的活动早已停止了，评论家及翻译家对出版事业也就失掉了兴趣。
    国内建设工作规模的宏大，人民创造性的高度发挥，这对于宣传一切新的、先进的事物给了无限的可能性；党组织的职务是充分利用这些可能性，以期在各个编辑部及出版局创造一种环境；在这种环境之下，和作家积极分子取得工作上的联系，认为是重大的政治任务。党组织经常关怀的是：一切报刊、各出版局在其业务上一定要依靠广大读者的帮助和支持。
    巩固和积极分子的联系，把工业、农业、科学和艺术的先进人物团结在编辑部及出版局的周围，是更进一步推动思想工作、提高我国出版物在对劳动人民进行共产主义教育事业中的作用底重要的条件。（启迪译）
