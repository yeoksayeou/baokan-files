    The first phase of the Yellow River Irrigation Project for Jiyue (River) in the plains province downstream of the Yellow River, which began construction last year, was completed at the end of last year. A trial water release was conducted on March 12th with good results, ensuring the formal release of water for irrigation in early April.
    Since last winter, there has been little snow and rain in Pingyuan Province. In order to implement the directives of the Central People's Government's Administrative Council on drought prevention and resistance, all employees of the Yellow River Irrigation Project for Jiyue worked actively to prepare for water release under the slogan of "Three Antis and Water Release Without Delay". On March 12th, all preparations for water release were completed, and a trial water release was conducted. On this day, Chao Zhefu, Chairman of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government, Vice Chairman Jia Xinzhai, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry Yang Jie, Director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission Wang Huayun, and Deputy Director Zhao Mingfu, all rushed from Xinxiang and Kaifeng to participate in the trial water ceremony. At 10:00 AM, the headgate of the canal was opened, and the water from the lower reaches of the Yellow River flowed into the irrigation canal for the first time in history. During the five days from the 12th to the 16th, a flow rate of ten cubic meters per second entered the main canal and the western irrigation area's main and branch canals, proving that the canals and all buildings met the expected requirements. As for the water source, although it is now a period of low water level in the Yellow River, it is no problem to draw out forty cubic meters per second. Trial water work will continue in the eastern irrigation area and the sediment settling area, and all trial water work can be completed in late March. Judging from the current results of the trial water release, it can be guaranteed that the first step of water release in April will irrigate 230,000 mu of farmland.
    Thousands upon thousands of farmers watched the rolling Yellow River water flow into the irrigation area with surprised eyes and grateful hearts. They said, "This has never happened in thousands of years. We won't have to rely on the heavens for a living anymore! This happiness is brought about by the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." Now, water conservancy management committees have been established in various irrigation areas, from the county to the village level, and each village has elected cadres to manage water conservancy. The farmers are busy tidying up the land to welcome the Yellow River water irrigation in April. (Xinhua News Agency)

    引黄灌溉济卫工程试行放水效果良好
    黄河下游平原省境内去年开工兴建的引黄（河）灌溉济卫（河）工程第一期工程已在去年年底完成，三月十二日工程处试行放水，效果良好，可以保证在四月初旬正式放水灌田。
    去冬以来，平原省雪、雨稀少。为了执行中央人民政府政务院的防旱、抗旱指示，引黄灌溉济卫工程处的全体职工，在“三反、放水两不误”的口号下，积极施工准备放水。三月十二日，一切放水的准备工作都已做好，试行放水。这天，平原省人民政府主席晁哲甫、副主席贾心斋、农林厅副厅长杨节和黄河水利委员会主任王化云、副主任赵明甫等，都分别由新乡、开封两市赶来参加试水典礼。上午十时渠首闸门开放，黄河下游的水，历史上第一次驯服地流进灌溉渠道。在十二日至十六日五天中，流量十秒公方的水流进了总干渠和西灌区干渠和支渠，证明渠道和所有建筑物都合乎预期的要求。至于水源，现在虽然是黄河水位较低时期，但引出四十秒公方的水也毫不成问题。试水工作将在东灌区和沉沙区继续举行，全部试水工作可在三月下旬结束。从现在试水的效果上看，可以保证四月份第一步放水灌溉二十三万亩农田。
    成千上万的农民都以惊喜的眼光和感激的心情，看着渠道中的滚滚黄水流进灌区。他们说：“这是万古千年没有的事，以后再不靠老天爷过时光了！这幸福是共产党、毛主席领导得来的。”现在各个灌溉区内，从县到村都成立起了水利管理委员会，各村都选举了管理水利的干部。农民们正忙着整理土地以迎接四月份的黄水灌溉。（新华社）
