Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th—The Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions convened a rally on the 2nd of March of workers and shop assistants against illegal merchants sabotaging the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence. More than 10,000 workers and shop assistants from all industries in the city participated in the meeting. Ye Jianying, Mayor of Guangzhou, also attended the meeting. At the meeting, workers and shop assistants angrily denounced the crimes of profiteers Lei Huaqing, Guan Xiang, Li Jinqi, Ye Canyuan, and others in sabotaging the movement, threatening the lives of workers, and even attempting to murder workers. Representatives of the City People's Court accepted the requests of the workers and shop assistants and publicly announced the punishment of these illegal merchants.

After the meeting began, workers and shop assistants took to the stage to denounce them. Lei Xilun and Lu Xuanzuan, workers from the Wanhua Repair Shop, denounced the crimes of the shop owner Lei Huaqing for consistently bribing cadres, stealing state assets, evading taxes, and cruelly exploiting workers. They said: This profiteer refused to confess during the movement and used despicable means such as refusing to accept business, forcing workers to stop work, stopping food supplies, and not paying for food to threaten the workers. All thirty-eight workers in the factory had not received wages since January 20th, and the factory owner owed more than 17 million yuan in wages, plus more than 15 million yuan in overtime pay. They unanimously demanded that the government severely punish the profiteer.

Another profiteer denounced, Li Jinqi, was the manager of the Xie Feng Paint Factory. Because workers Ou Huazai, Ou Niuzai, and Ou Jinhui reported him for cutting corners and stealing state assets, Li Jinqi harbored resentment. On February 5th, when Ou Niuzai and Ou Jinhui were working on the coast, he instigated his lackey Li Huai to push the two into the sea. Fortunately, the water was shallow and they did not drown. Ou Huazai and Ou Niuzai denounced Li Jinqi's crime of murdering workers at the meeting and demanded that the government severely punish him.

Pei Taixian, a shop assistant at the Sheng Changlong Pharmacy, denounced the crime of Guan Xiang, the deputy manager of the shop, for beating and insulting him, saying: After I reported Guan Xiang for smuggling gold for export and selling fake medicines, Guan Xiang harbored resentment. He falsely accused me of "embezzling" 90,000 yuan and cursed me as a "special agent," brutally beating me.

Workers from the Tongyuanxie Rubber Factory denounced the crime of the factory owner, Ye Canyuan, for sabotaging the movement. Worker Liang Ji said: "Ye Canyuan is very cunning. After the movement started, he damaged the machines, refused to accept business, did not pay for food, and did not pay wages. By February 19th, he owed more than 60 million yuan in wages, making it impossible for the workers to live." Worker Liang Gai said: Ye Canyuan is ungrateful. When accepting government processing tasks, he used various means to steal more than 1.1 billion yuan in state assets.

Under the pressure of the masses, the denounced profiteers Lei Huaqing and Ye Canyuan expressed their willingness to bow their heads and admit their mistakes on the spot. The workers and shop assistants present at the meeting were extremely angry at the profiteers' crimes of sabotaging the movement and unanimously demanded that the government severely punish them. Wan Siyuan, Vice President of the Guangzhou People's Court, accepted the demands of the masses on behalf of the court and announced the verdict at the meeting: Guan Xiang, Deputy Manager of Sheng Changlong Pharmacy, was sentenced to two years in prison. Ye Canyuan was allowed to be released on bail because he was able to admit his mistake on the spot, guarantee to start work and provide food, and pay wages. Lei Huaqing was able to accept the opinions of the workers on the spot, start work and provide food, pay wages, and guarantee that he would not commit any more crimes in the future, so he was ordered to return to the factory and not be detained any longer. Li Jinqi's crime was serious, so he was taken back to the court to await trial.

Ye Jianying, Mayor of Guangzhou, said to the meeting: "The Guangzhou working class's struggle against illegal profiteers shows the love of the awakened Guangzhou workers for their government. The People's Government's judgment of several illegal merchants is fair and just. If any profiteer does not accept the lesson and dares to continue to sabotage the struggle of workers and shop assistants, then he will be subject to more severe punishment." Ye Jianying finally called on all workers and shop assistants in the city to draw a clear line between classes, actively report, and continue the struggle until the final victory.

    广州市工人、店员万余人集会
    斗争破坏反盗窃运动的奸商
    市人民法院当场宣布处罚这些违法商人
    【新华社广州四日电】广州市总工会筹备会在二日召开工人、店员反对不法商人破坏反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动斗争大会。参加大会的有全市各行业工人、店员一万多人。广州市人民政府市长叶剑英也参加了大会。会上，工人、店员愤怒地控诉了奸商雷华清、关祥、黎锦琪、叶灿源等破坏运动，威胁工人生活甚至企图谋害工人的罪行。市人民法院代表接受工人、店员的请求，当场宣布了对这些不法商人的处罚。
    大会开始后，工人、店员即纷纷上台控诉。万华修车厂工人雷锡伦、陆瑄钻控诉了该厂老板雷华清一贯向干部行贿、盗窃国家资财、偷税漏税、残酷地剥削工人等罪行。他们说：这个奸商在运动中拒绝坦白，并用不接生意、强迫工人停工、停开伙食、不发伙食费等卑劣手段来威胁工人。全厂三十八个工人，从一月二十日起就没有领到工资，该厂资方欠薪达一千七百多万元，另欠加班费一千五百多万元。他们一致要求政府严惩奸商。
    被控诉的另一奸商黎锦琪，是协丰油漆厂经理。由于该厂工人欧华仔、欧牛仔及欧锦辉检举他偷工减料，盗窃国家资财，黎锦琪就怀恨在心。在二月五日，欧牛仔和欧锦辉二人在海岸工作时，他唆使狗腿黎怀将二人推进海中。幸因水浅没有淹死。欧华仔、欧牛仔在大会上控诉了黎锦琪谋害工人的罪行，要求政府严办。
    生昌隆药行店员裴泰贤控诉了该行副经理关祥殴打和侮辱他的罪行说：我检举了关祥私运黄金出口、卖假药等罪行后，关祥就怀恨在心，他诬赖我“贪污”了九万元，又骂我是“特务”，凶暴地打我。
    同源协胶厂工人控诉了该厂老板叶灿源破坏运动的罪行。工人梁基说：“叶灿源非常狡猾，运动开始后，他破坏机器，不接生意，不发伙食费，也不发工资，到二月十九日为止，积欠了工资六千多万元，使工人无法生活。”工人梁盖说：叶灿源忘恩负义，在接受政府加工任务时用各种手段盗窃国家资财十一亿多元。
    在群众压力下，被控诉的奸商雷华清、叶灿源当场表示低头认错。到会工人、店员对奸商破坏运动的罪行，愤怒万分，一致要求政府严办。广州市人民法院副院长万思元代表法院接受群众要求，在会上宣布判决：生昌隆药行副经理关祥判徒刑二年。叶灿源因能当场认错，保证开工开伙，清付工资，准予取保释放。雷华清能当场接受工人意见，开工开伙，清发工资，保证以后不犯，令其回厂，不再扣押。黎锦琪罪行重大，押回法院，听候审讯。
    广州市人民政府市长叶剑英向大会讲话说：“广州工人阶级对不法奸商的斗争，表示觉悟了的广州工人对自己政府的爱戴。人民政府对几个不法商人的判决是公平的、正义的。如果有那一个奸商不接受教训，胆敢继续破坏工人、店员的斗争，那么就要受到更严厉的处罚。”叶剑英最后号召全市工人、店员划清阶级界限，积极检举，继续斗争直到最后胜利。
