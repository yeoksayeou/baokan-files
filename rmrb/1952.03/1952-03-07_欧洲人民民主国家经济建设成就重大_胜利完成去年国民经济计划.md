The European People's Democracies have made significant achievements in economic construction.
    The national economic plan for last year was successfully completed.
    [Report from this newspaper] 1951 was a year in which the European People's Democracies continued to carry out large-scale economic construction and achieved significant results.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Parties, Workers' Parties, and Labor Parties, and with the sincere friendship and assistance of the Soviet Union, the working people of the People's Democracies have all completed or successfully implemented plans for developing the national economy. The industrial production of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, and the German Democratic Republic now exceeds the 1950 level by 14.5 to over 47 percent. The production of heavy industry, which is decisive for economic development and the consolidation of national defense, has increased even more in these countries, with some reaching twice the pre-war level, and some even more than three times. The labor productivity of industries in various countries has also greatly improved, far exceeding the pre-war level. Many notable achievements have also been made in agriculture and other areas of economic construction.

    The implementation of the 1951 economic plans in various countries is described as follows: In Poland, socialist industrial production completed 100.8 percent of the plan last year, with the value of products increasing by approximately 24.4 percent compared to last year. The production volume of large and medium-sized industries has reached 270 percent of the pre-war 1938 level. Many industries have produced many goods that had never been produced before, including coal mining combines, various new types of machine tools, drilling machines for the petroleum industry, new types of seeders, ships, and locomotives. Poland's automotive industry has also begun manufacturing "Warsaw" brand cars and "Lublin" brand trucks. Due to increased labor productivity and savings in raw materials and fuel consumption, production costs in various industrial sectors decreased by 4.6 percent compared to 1950. In agriculture, the grain sown area last year increased by 1.2 percent compared to the previous year. The total output of socialist agriculture increased by 51 percent compared to the previous year. The number of state-owned mechanized farming stations increased by 70 percent compared to the previous year; the number of tractors increased by 86 percent. The number of electrified villages has increased to 12,863. Czechoslovakia

    The 1951 economic plan – the third year of the expanded five-year plan – was completed by 99.7 percent, with the chemical industry completing 103.3 percent and light industry completing 103.1 percent. The total industrial output in 1951 increased by 14.5 percent compared to 1950, and, calculated per capita, it increased by one-fold compared to 1937. The output of industrial sectors such as lignite, milling iron, and freight cars has approached or exceeded the levels stipulated for 1953 in the five-year plan. Currently, Czechoslovak industry is capable of producing equipment for hydroelectric power stations, huge presses, and steam boilers. In agriculture, the number of agricultural production cooperatives had grown to 7,573 by 1951. The organized agricultural production cooperatives have developed in a more advanced direction and achieved great success. Last year, a total of 600 cooperatives nationwide decided to remove field boundaries in order to use machinery for large-scale farming. The number of machine tractor stations increased by nearly a quarter last year, promoting the mechanization of agricultural labor. Romania

    The 1951 total output plan was completed by 104.5 percent, and the production volume increased by 28.7 percent compared to 1950. The manufacture of new-style machinery needed for the petroleum and coal mining industries and the construction industry, as well as crawler tractors and combines, has been organized. The investment amount in 1951 increased by 30.5 percent compared to 1950; the volume of construction projects increased by 42.4 percent. Labor productivity increased by 10 percent; production costs decreased by 5.65 percent. In agriculture, the cultivated area in 1951 increased by 130,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare) compared to 1950. The total output of major crops greatly exceeded the 1950 level: wheat exceeded by 58.7 percent; cotton exceeded by 147.3 percent; sugar beets exceeded by 126 percent; and corn exceeded by 29.7 percent. The socialist sector of agriculture is expanding and consolidating daily. A total of 50 new machine tractor stations were opened in 1951. Hungary Hungarian industry has completed 103.4 percent of the expanded 1951 plan (the second year of the five-year plan). Last year, the total industrial output increased by 30.1 percent compared to 1950. Among them, heavy industry production increased by 37.7 percent, and light industry production increased by 26.9 percent. The total national investment in 1951 increased by 44.8 percent compared to 1950. Many new factories, such as the Stalin Iron and Steel Plant and the pipe manufacturing plant in the Rakosi Factory, began production in 1951. Hungary manufactured various new types of lathes, coal cutters, electric lifting hoists, etc., for the first time last year. Last year's agricultural harvest was the best since the liberation of Hungary. Compared with the average output of the ten years before the war, last year's wheat output increased by 22.8 percent; rye increased by 21.5 percent; barley increased by 19.2 percent; sugar beets increased by 15.4 percent; and corn increased by 30.6 percent. Last year, the state's investment in agriculture increased by 42.1 percent compared to the previous year. The area of irrigated land increased by 31.7 percent compared to the previous year, and the use of artificial fertilizers increased by 37.2 percent. Due to the increase in agricultural machinery, the work done by machine stations last year increased by 150 percent, and the area of deep plowing increased by 63 percent. The socialist part of agriculture continued to increase. Last year, the cultivated area of state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, experimental farms, etc., accounted for a quarter of the total cultivated area in the country. Bulgaria

    The 1951 economic plan has been overfulfilled. The output of many important industries has increased significantly compared to 1950. Pig iron increased by 73.6 percent, steel ingots increased by 105 percent, and the production of tractor plows and threshing machines increased by one-fold to one and a half-fold. Bulgarian industry is now capable of producing many things that it could not produce in the past. The electrical industry can now meet domestic needs. The chemical industry, which did not exist before liberation, now has a good foundation. The "Stalin Chemical Plant," newly built in 1951, produces 70,000 tons of artificial fertilizer annually, which can supply 50 percent of the country's agricultural needs. In agriculture, the planting area of cotton crops increased by 34.1 percent. Wheat production increased by 40 percent compared to 1950, and corn increased by 90 percent. In the past year, more than 1,200 agricultural production cooperatives have been added, and 55 percent of farmers nationwide have switched from individual operation to collective farming; machine tractor stations received more than 1,200 new tractors, more than 1,400 tractor plows, nearly 1,000 seeders, and 550 Soviet combine harvesters last year.

    Last year, the total national investment increased by 40.6 percent compared to 1950. Albania

    The 1951 total industrial output plan was completed by 105.9 percent, and the total industrial output increased by 47.1 percent compared to 1950. The land reclamation plan exceeded by 67 percent. The total national investment in 1951 increased by 31.6 percent compared to the previous year, and the total local investment increased by 42 percent. Newly constructed socialist large-scale industrial enterprises, such as the Stalin Textile Factory, the Lenin Hydroelectric Power Station, the "November 8th" Sugar Refinery, and the cotton ginning factory in the Fieri area, all started production last year. German Democratic Republic

    The total industrial output in 1951 (the first year of the five-year plan) exceeded the plan by 5.2 percent, which is 36 percent higher than the pre-war 1936 level (Note: The overall goal of the five-year plan stipulates that by the end of 1955, industrial output should be increased to twice that of 1936). The output of state-owned industries in 1951 increased by 24.4 percent compared to 1950. In agriculture, almost all plans were overfulfilled. The number of machines owned by machine and tractor stations has greatly increased, for example: tractors increased by 42.6 percent, tractor-drawn plows increased by 74.2 percent, other machines increased by 114.5 percent, the total investment in 1951 increased by more than 40 percent compared to 1950, most of which was invested in industrial production. While production increased, foreign trade (excluding trade with West Germany) also increased significantly, with the total value increasing by 60 percent compared to 1950. Among the export goods, the most important are machinery, electrical equipment, tools, optical equipment, and chemical products.

    As a result of the economic development of the People's Democracies, the material life and cultural level of the working people have greatly improved. Poland's national income increased by 12 percent compared to 1950; retail trade volume increased by 11 percent; the work of eliminating illiteracy was completed last year; the total number of books and periodicals issued reached 108.8 million copies; and the number of hospital beds increased by 10,000 compared to the previous year. Czechoslovakia's national income last year increased by 10 percent compared to the previous year, and, calculated per capita, it exceeded the pre-war level by 68 percent. Due to the steady improvement of living conditions and the development of health services, Czechoslovakia's population increased by 23.1 per thousand last year. Romania's national income increased by 32 percent compared to 1950; the sales volume of industrial products increased by 22.3 percent compared to 1950. Hungary's national income increased by 23 percent compared to 1950; the number of books published was 90.5 percent more than in 1950. The production of consumer goods and food in Bulgaria has also greatly increased. Compared to 1950, cotton fabrics increased by 13.5 percent, linen fabrics increased by 46 percent, cheese increased by 34.1 percent, and sugar increased by 114.6 percent. In Albania, the number of workers in the major sectors of the national economy increased by 12.7 percent in the past year; in terms of cultural construction, three new universities were opened last year. The German Democratic Republic reduced the prices of daily necessities across the country last year and abolished the rationing system for flour, bread, many manufactured goods, and cotton fabrics.

    The achievements made in the economic construction of the European People's Democracies in 1951 have further strengthened the world peace and democratic forces led by the Soviet Union. The people of the People's Democracies are full of confidence in their just cause and socialist future. They will continue to strengthen the forces against imperialist aggression and defend world peace through creative labor, and strive for a better and happier future.
