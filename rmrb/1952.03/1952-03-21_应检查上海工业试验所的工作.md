    The Work of the Shanghai Industrial Testing Institute Should be Inspected
    To the Editor: Last December, our department sent personnel to purchase a generator from the Shanghai Xin Chang Mechanical & Electrical Company. Because our personnel lacked mechanical knowledge, we paid over 200,000 yuan to the Shanghai Industrial Testing Institute of the Central Light Industry Ministry to inspect it. However, after the machine was transported back, we discovered that it was a two-pole DC machine that had been converted into an AC machine. The added electrical rings, carbon brush holders, etc., could not be securely operated, and the internal insulation was no longer usable. Furthermore, parts such as the magnetic field coils were damaged, and unscrupulous merchants had coated them with a mixture of rosin and other substances to conceal the damage. The engine was also pieced together from various sources. Despite these major flaws in the machine, Liu, an experimenter at the Shanghai Industrial Testing Institute, wrote on the test report form: "Generator insulation is good, temperature is normal, oil temperature is normal..." We demand that the government punish the unscrupulous merchants who cut corners and used substandard materials. At the same time, we hope that the leaders of the Shanghai Industrial Testing Institute will also investigate this matter.
                                                                                           Zhang Zhihua

    应检查上海工业试验所的工作
    编辑同志：去年十二月，我部派员在上海鑫昌机电号买了一台发电机。我部人员因不懂机械，曾缴了二十多万元，请中央轻工业部上海工业试验所加以检验。但机器运回后，我们发现机器是由两极直流机改装成交流机的，加装的某电环、炭刷架等都不能固定运转，机内绝缘已不堪再用；此外，磁场线圈等部分已破坏，是奸商用松脂等混合物把它涂好的。发动机也是东拼西凑而成的。机器有这样大的毛病，而上海工业试验所的试验员刘某竟在试验报告单上写着：发电机绝缘良好，温度正常，油温正常……。我们要求政府惩办偷工减料的奸商。同时希望上海工业试验所领导方面也检查这个问题。    张治华
