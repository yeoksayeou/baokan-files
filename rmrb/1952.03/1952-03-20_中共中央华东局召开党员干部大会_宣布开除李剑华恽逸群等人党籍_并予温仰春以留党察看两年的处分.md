    CCP Central Committee East China Bureau Holds Meeting of Party Member Cadres
    Announces Expulsion of Li Jianhua, Yun Yiqun, and Others from the Party
    And Gives Wen Yangchun a Two-Year Probationary Period Within the Party
    [This Newspaper's News] The CCP Central Committee East China Bureau convened a meeting of Party member cadres directly under the East China level on March 10th. At the meeting, Comrade Chen Yi, on behalf of the East China Bureau, formally announced: In order to purify the Party's organization, enforce Party discipline, and further promote the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle, the East China Bureau has decided: (1) To expel Li Jianhua, Deputy Minister of the Labor Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, Yun Yiqun, Director of the East China News Publication Bureau and former President of the Liberation Daily, Li Guobin, former Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the East China Military and Political Committee organs, and Zhou Lixing, Director of the Religious Affairs Office of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the East China Military and Political Committee, from the Party, and suggest that relevant departments remove them from all administrative positions. (2) To give Wen Yangchun, Vice-President of the East China People's Revolutionary University and Vice-President of the Party School of the East China Bureau, a two-year probationary period within the Party, and suggest that relevant departments remove him from all administrative positions.
    (3) Xu Lun, Director of the General Office of the East China Bureau's Propaganda Department, and Fang Keqiang, Director of the General Office of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, are to be immediately suspended from their duties and conduct self-criticism.
    Comrade Chen Yi pointed out: This is an important measure taken by our Party in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. Our Party is great, glorious, and correct. Today, we expel these extremely vile bad elements who have lost the qualifications of a Communist Party member from the Party and give serious disciplinary punishments to Party members who have made serious mistakes, proving that the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, has no interests other than the interests of the people. No matter what level the cadres are at, when they make mistakes that seriously harm the interests of the Party and the people, our Party is strict in discipline and will never tolerate them. This is one of the fundamental reasons why our Party can lead the Chinese people from victory to victory.
    Hu Lijiao, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the East China Bureau, reported to the meeting on the main facts of the mistakes committed by the seven cadres who were punished: (1) Li Jianhua, who joined the Party in 1934, has consistently resisted self-criticism in the "Three-Anti" movement, saying that there were no "tigers" in the Labor Department. In reality, he himself was a "tiger." He had 110 taels of gold in storage, and more than 10 million yuan deposited in private banks under an assumed name, all of which should have been turned over to the public. In addition, Li was also indiscriminate between the enemy and ourselves, and cohabited with Zou Beiyao, the niece of the great traitor Zou Baoshan and a Kuomintang member, for as long as four years. Li also arranged for Zou's younger brother's classmate, Lan, to work in the Labor Department, and arbitrarily promoted Lan to deputy section chief. Li's father was a landlord and was detained during the land reform. He even attempted to intimidate the peasants with his identity as the Deputy Minister of the Labor Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, blaming those below for "going too far." Li's younger brother, Li Zongyi, was a counter-revolutionary element with a serious blood debt. Not only did he not report him, he even dared to question the local military and political organs after Li Zongyi was arrested. (2) Yun Yiqun, who rejoined the Party in 1938, has always maintained close ties with landlords and the bourgeoisie. During his tenure as the President of the Liberation Daily, he used his position and power to transfer 250 million yuan of readers' donations and public funds of the newspaper to Wu Hanchang, his "sworn brother," fellow villager, and businessman, to open the "Guanghua Coal Mine" without any organizational procedures. To this day, the "coal mine" has long been closed down, and apart from Yun Yiqun personally receiving some "gifts," the newspaper has not received a single penny, and the funds cannot be recovered. In order to cover up his mistakes, Yun also bought and sold real estate with Wu Hanchang and others to make money, which had an extremely bad influence. In addition, Yun's older sister was a landlord tyrant who was struggled against in the 1951 land reform. Yun wrote to the East China Land Reform Committee and the CCP Southern Jiangsu District Committee, blaming the peasants for struggling against a "good person." After the District Committee sent people to investigate and proved that he was indeed protecting the landlord family, he defended himself in every possible way, resisted the organization's decision, and did not make a self-criticism. Furthermore, according to the materials that have been checked, Yun had embezzled 5 million yuan of real estate tax that should have been handed over to the public, illegally received 600 units of concurrent salary, and kept 6 million yuan of public funds at home until recently when he handed them over. Yun also constantly introduced many people with unclear backgrounds to various organs. Although the higher authorities have repeatedly helped him with these many mistakes, he still does not have a clear understanding and his self-criticism is extremely incomplete. (3) Li Guobin, consistently possessed the bourgeois hedonistic ideology, had repeatedly wavered politically in the past, and after the national liberation, used his position and power to embezzle public funds, collude with unscrupulous merchants, engage in speculation and profiteering, and protect his father's felling of forests and selling them at high prices, and soon gained a windfall of over 100 million yuan. In order to engage in speculation and profiteering, he did not hesitate to protect counter-revolutionary elements in transporting timber, smuggling and evading taxes, and supplying economic intelligence. He himself squandered his illegal income and became corrupt, degenerate, and metamorphosed. (4) Zhou Lixing, born into a landlord family, has consistently had a rogue mentality, his private life is extremely corrupt, he frequently has relationships with women of unclear backgrounds, and he has the shameful behavior of embezzling Party member donations, creating an extremely bad influence inside and outside the Party. In his work, he has a serious bureaucratic work style and has violated the Party's confidentiality rules. The above four people have all lost the qualifications to be a Communist Party member. (5) Wen Yangchun, selfish and self-interested, pursuing enjoyment, lives in the beautiful apartment where the war criminal Gu Zhutong lived in Suzhou, and is still not satisfied, engages in large-scale construction and extravagant spending. In his work style, he is extremely bad, ruling subordinates in a patriarchal manner, retaliating against them, and being arrogant and disrespectful to superiors, disregarding the organization. In handling many issues, he loses his stance and, without the Party's approval, arbitrarily serves as the director of the fellow villagers association. In the "Three-Anti" movement, his self-criticism of these mistakes is not profound, and he has repeatedly covered them up and confronted the organization. (6) Xu Lun, has consistently had a bad work style, has a very strong sense of authority, disregards the organization, and speaks irresponsibly. For example, in the "internal publications" published by the Propaganda Department, without asking for instructions, he arbitrarily added an editor's note, saying that a certain document was "very good, and it is hoped that Party committees at all levels will guarantee its implementation." He used a sectarian viewpoint to distort the principled ideological struggle within the Party. He is obsequious to superiors in person but full of complaints behind their backs, and extremely undemocratic to subordinates. After his mistakes were exposed, he covered them up in every possible way and slandered the leadership. (7) Fang Keqiang, has consistently had serious right-leaning emotions, handing over all the work he managed to Lu Gaoyi, the bourgeois agent and major embezzler, causing the state to lose more than 10 billion yuan in one order alone. In the "Three-Anti" movement, he not only did not conduct a serious self-criticism, but also regarded many embezzlers as "gentlemen," blindly trusting them and not actively carrying out the "Three-Anti" struggle. Even after being strictly criticized by the leadership, he still did not show any active action.
    Next, Comrade Zeng Shan reported on the progress of the "tiger hunt" battle in the East China-level organs. Comrade Tan Zhenlin spoke at the end of the meeting. He said: If we cannot bravely carry out such a struggle, expel bad elements like Cao Manzhi from the Party, and remove Li Yu, Gu Zhun, and others from their posts, our Party will have no combat effectiveness. By doing this, we will not only not weaken our Party's combat effectiveness, but on the contrary, it will make our Party more pure, healthy, and strong. This is a victory for the Party and the people. We will continue to work tirelessly to rectify the Party's organization to better meet the requirements of combat, in order to meet the arrival of the glorious combat task of large-scale production and construction.

    中共中央华东局召开党员干部大会
    宣布开除李剑华恽逸群等人党籍
    并予温仰春以留党察看两年的处分
    【本报讯】中共中央华东局于三月十日召集华东一级直属机关党员干部大会。会上，陈毅同志代表华东局正式宣布：为了纯洁党的组织，严肃党的纪律，推动反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争进一步发展，华东局决定：（一）开除华东军政委员会劳动部副部长李剑华、华东新闻出版局局长及解放日报社前社长恽逸群、中共华东军政委员会机关党委员会前副书记李国斌、华东军政委员会文化教育委员会宗教事务处处长周力行等四人的党籍，并建议有关方面撤消其一切行政职务。（二）给华东人民革命大学副校长、华东局党校副校长温仰春以留党察看二年的处分，并建议有关方面撤消其一切行政职务。
    （三）华东局宣传部办公室主任徐仑、华东纺织管理局办公室主任方克强着即停职反省。
    陈毅同志指出：这是我们党在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中的一个重要措施。我们党是伟大的、光荣的、正确的，今天我们把这些品质极端恶劣、丧失共产党党员条件的坏分子开除出党，给犯了严重错误的党员以严肃的纪律处分，证明以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党除了人民的利益之外，没有别的利益。不论是那一级的干部，当他们犯了错误，严重地危害党和人民的利益的时候，我们的党是纪律严明绝不姑息的。这就是为什么我们党能够领导中国人民从胜利走向胜利的根本原因之一。
    华东局组织部副部长胡立教同志向大会报告了七个受处分干部所犯错误的主要事实：（一）李剑华，一九三四年入党，在“三反”运动中始终抗拒检讨，说劳动部无“老虎”，实际上因为他本身就是“老虎”，他存有黄金一百一十两，另外在私营银行化名存款一千多万元，都是应当缴公的款项。此外，李又敌我不分，与大汉奸邹葆珊的侄女国民党员邹蓓尧姘居达四年之久。李并将邹的弟弟的同学蓝某安置在劳动部工作，并擅自将蓝提拔为副科长。李的父亲是地主，在土地改革中被扣押，他竟企图以华东军政委员会劳动部副部长的身份吓唬农民，责备下面“过火”。李的弟弟李宗义是一个有严重血案的反革命分子，他不但不加以检举，竟敢在李宗义被捕后向当地军政机关提出质问。（二）恽逸群，一九三八年恢复党籍，但他与地主资产阶级始终保持着千丝万缕的亲密联系，在其任职解放日报社社长期内，利用职权，未经任何组织手续，先后擅将读者捐献及报社公款两亿五千万元交给其“结拜兄弟”、同乡、商人吴汉昌开设“光华煤矿”，至今“煤矿”早已停闭，除恽逸群个人得到若干“礼物”外，报社分文未得，款项也收不回来。为掩饰错误，恽又与吴汉昌等在一起买卖房产，从中赚钱，影响极为恶劣。此外，恽的姊姊是地主恶霸，在一九五一年土地改革时被斗争，恽又向华东土地改革委员会、中共苏南区党委写信，责备农民斗了“好人”，经区党委派人调查证明他确是包庇地主家庭时，他又多方辩护，抗拒组织决定，不作检讨。此外，据已检查出的材料，恽曾侵吞应交公的房地产税款五百万元，不法地领取兼职薪金六百单位，另有公款六百万元存放家中，直至最近才上缴。恽并不断介绍许多面目不清的人员到各机关。恽的这许多错误，虽经上级一再帮助，他仍然认识不清，检讨极不彻底。（三）李国斌，一贯存在着资产阶级的享乐思想，历史上曾多次发生政治动摇，在全国解放后，利用职权，盗用公款，勾结奸商，投机牟利，包庇其父砍伐山林，高价出售，不久即获暴利一亿元以上。为了投机牟利，不惜包庇反革命分子贩运木材，走私漏税，供给经济情报，自己则将非法所得，大肆挥霍，以至腐化堕落，蜕化变质。（四）周力行，出身地主家庭，一贯有流氓意识，私生活极端腐化，经常与面目不清的女人发生关系，并有贪污党员捐献款项的可耻行为，在党内外造成极恶劣的影响。在工作中则存在着严重的官僚主义作风，并有违反党的保密规则的情事。以上四人都已失去作为一个共产党员的条件。（五）温仰春，自私自利，追求享受，住在苏州战犯顾祝同住过的漂亮公寓内，还不满意，大兴土木，铺张挥霍。在作风上，极为恶劣，对下家长统治，打击报复，对上妄自尊大，目无组织。在处理许多问题中，丧失立场，未经党的批准，擅自担任同乡会的主任。在“三反”运动中，他对这些错误，检讨极不深刻，并一再掩饰，对抗组织。（六）徐仑，作风一贯恶劣，权威思想极重，目无组织，信口开河。如在宣传部出版的“内部刊物”上，未经请示，擅加按语，说某某文件“很好，望各级党委保证执行”。用宗派主义的观点，歪曲党内原则性的思想斗争。对上当面唯唯诺诺，背后牢骚满腹，对下则极不民主。在他的错误被揭发后，又多方掩饰，污蔑领导。（七）方克强，一贯的存在严重的右倾情绪，将自己所管理的工作全部交给资产阶级的代理人大贪污犯陆高谊去办，使国家在一项定货中即损失百多亿元。“三反”运动中，他不仅不认真检讨，反把许多贪污分子当作“正人君子”，盲目信任，不积极开展“三反”斗争，经领导上严格指责后，仍无积极行动表现。
    接着，曾山同志报告了华东一级机关“打虎”战斗进展情况。谭震林同志在大会结束时讲话。他说：如果我们不能勇敢地进行这样的斗争，把曹漫之之流的坏分子开除党籍，把黎玉、顾准等人撤职，我们的党就没有战斗力。我们这样作了，这不仅不会削弱我们党的战斗力，相反的，它使我们党更加纯洁、健康、强大。这是党和人民的胜利。我们将毫不松懈地继续努力把党的组织整顿得更适合战斗的要求，以迎接大规模生产建设的光荣的战斗任务的到来。
