    Commander Cheng Yuezhang's Simple and Austere Lifestyle
    Wang Yuhu
    Simple Room
    I walked into Commander Cheng Yuezhang's room. The simplicity and austerity of this room left a deep impression on me. A house that was not very big was divided into two rooms, one was the bedroom and the other was the office. The office only had a rectangular desk and a few old sofas. Books and documents were neatly placed on two windowsills, and various newspapers were neatly placed on an unpainted newspaper rack. The bedroom was even smaller, with a large bed for his wife and children and a small bed for himself almost filling the room. Adding some utensils, there was hardly any room to move around in. Seeing this, I couldn't help but say, "Commander is still so simple!" Commander Cheng, upon hearing this, disapproved and said, "What's so simple about this? It's much more comfortable than before. During the war, we slept in the freezing cold, and our legs were our desks. Didn't we still work the same way?" I said, "The current environment is different..." Before I could finish, Commander Cheng interrupted me. He said, "The current environment is still one that requires hard work. Just like Chairman Mao told us: our revolution has only taken the first step of the Long March. We must maintain the tradition of hard work in order to achieve long-term, final happiness." Speaking of this, Commander Cheng talked about some comrades who, when they returned from outside, always liked to talk about and boast about the tall buildings in big cities, and the beautiful and exquisite furniture and furnishings. They rarely mentioned the struggle situation and work experience there. Commander Cheng felt very distressed about this and said seriously and excitedly, "These comrades of ours, we should say they have forgotten their roots! They have forgotten the past battles and today's tasks, forgotten the living standards of the broad masses and the soldiers producing on the Gobi Desert, forgotten the martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution!" Speaking of this, he recalled and spoke of the heroic sacrifices of some old comrades-in-arms a long time ago, saying painfully, "At that time, these comrades were much stronger than me in every aspect, but they unfortunately sacrificed! What did they sacrifice for? Wasn't it for everyone's long-term, final happiness! Now we are still very far from long-term, final happiness, and we already want to enjoy ourselves. How can we be worthy of those sacrificed comrades!" Commander Cheng's words moved me, as if they had brought me back to the fiery, bullet-filled battlefield, making me once again receive the test and education of battle.
    Two Old Cotton Quilts
    I walked into Commander Cheng's bedroom. Since there were no stools, I sat down on the bed. The first thing that caught my attention in this small room was an old cotton quilt. I looked at it again and again, as if I was very familiar with it. I couldn't help but ask, "Isn't this the spoils of victory from the battle of Baoji in 1948?" Commander Cheng smiled when he heard this and said, "Oh! You still recognize it." I also said with a smile, "I don't quite recognize it anymore. The grass-green quilt cover has almost been washed white." At this time, Commander Cheng said with a smile again:
    "This spoil of victory is about to become a souvenir. Covering it will never let me forget the past battles." These two sentences seemed very ordinary, but they were swirling in my mind; I felt that there was a very deep meaning contained within. This reminded me that in 1946, in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, he had also said something similar today for his old cotton quilt. That quilt was brought back to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region from the Taihang Mountain Anti-Japanese Base in 1940 and had been used until 1946; it was already dilapidated. The supply department had repeatedly said that they would replenish a new one for him, but he had refused it time and time again. It was not until all the commanders and fighters of the division had universally replenished a cotton quilt that he asked for one. I remember that this matter had a great impact because at that time, it was after Japan's surrender, and in the minds of many comrades, a sense of peaceful paralysis and the idea of "going down the mountain to enjoy happiness" was growing. Commander Cheng's style of hard work and simplicity was like an alarm bell, making everyone wake up... Thinking of this, I couldn't help but say, "Commander, do you still remember that quilt in Zhangcunyi (a place in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region)?" Commander Cheng said after hearing this, "I remember, so..." Speaking of this, he pointed to the old cotton quilt seized in Baoji and continued, "It can still be used for a few more years!" Quitting Cigarettes and Other Things
    Commander Cheng used to smoke a lot, especially when he was busy with work and thinking about problems, he almost smoked one cigarette after another; therefore, he had suffered from a very serious cough. Because of this, others had also advised him to smoke less; however, smoking too much seemed to have become a habit and was difficult to change. Some time ago, I went to Commander Cheng's house, he took out cigarettes to entertain me, but he didn't smoke one himself. I asked strangely, "Commander doesn't smoke anymore?" Commander Cheng said, "It costs too much, I quit." I said after hearing this, "How much money can smoking cost?" Commander Cheng then said, "It's not a small amount! All the allowances and health care fees are not enough!" I said, "It's about the same, isn't it?" Commander Cheng pondered slightly and said, "It should be about the same, but people are never satisfied." After hearing the last sentence, I seemed a little confused. Commander Cheng probably also saw that I looked a little lost, so he explained to me, "Do you remember? When we were fighting in Yulin (place name), we couldn't find grass tobacco, so we had to use tree leaves as cigarettes. Didn't we get through it then? Later, being able to smoke cigarettes, even the worst cigarettes, was a treasure. But now that there are more cigarettes, we start to pick and choose, and we can't smoke the bad ones. A few days ago, I did the math, and my monthly cigarette expenses have exceeded the amount I should spend. If I continue like this, I will be violating the system. So I decided to quit and not smoke anymore. This is also good for my health." This passage of his deeply moved me, making me feel that he was so strict with himself in any small place. This reminded me of some of his past events:
    I remember that in the years of war, whenever his food was a little better, he would tell the cooks, "Don't exceed the supply standards!" Once, he knew that the vegetable money had exceeded the supply standards, but the cooks bought a chicken again. So, he said sternly to the cook, "The supply standards have been exceeded, where is there any money to buy a chicken!" The cook said, "Don't worry, I have a way." Commander Cheng said somewhat angrily, "What way do you have! If the money spent is recorded under my name, Cheng Yuezhang, it probably won't be cleared with a month's allowance." The cook laughed involuntarily after hearing this, "How can we let the commander pay? I mean..." Commander Cheng didn't allow him to finish, and ordered, "What else is there to say!" The cook originally wanted to explain that this month's deficit could be made up for by next month's vegetable money. However, Commander Cheng interrupted him without allowing any explanation, making him helplessly return the chicken to the original owner. At the time, the cook seemed a little unhappy, but after thinking about it: what was Commander Cheng doing it for? Wasn't it to comply with the supply system, to save money for the people? Thinking of this, the temporary displeasure turned into respect and love for Commander Cheng.
    I also remember that it was during the war, during the troop's rest period, his wife came from the rear with the children. The clothes of the two children were already so tattered that they were unrecognizable. His wife had wanted the organization to help solve this problem; however, Commander Cheng disagreed, "There are so many children in the whole division! If everyone asks the organization for special care, can the organization afford to take care of them?" Later, seeing that the children's clothes were really unwearable, he secretly borrowed more than a zhang of cloth from the guards and sewed two clothes for the children. In fact, Commander Cheng loved his children very much, and he paid great attention to their ideological and character education. For example: he often told the children stories about fighting battles. When watching plays, he explained the content of the play to the children as if they were adults, and even played with them like a child. However, he hated any special care for his children. Special care would cultivate vanity and hedonism, which the children originally did not have, and would have a very bad impact on cultivating their progressive, self-reliant, and hardworking character.
    Sharing Weal and Woe with Soldiers
    "Sharing weal and woe with soldiers" is Commander Cheng's consistent style, and it is also a principle he uses in leading troops. There are too many things in this regard. I would like to cite only a few small things that I personally saw when entering Xinjiang and suppressing the Usman bandits.
    The soldiers' car was about to start. Commander Cheng's jeep driver ran to ask Commander Cheng, "Should I start the car?" Commander Cheng said after hearing this, "What car are you starting? Can't you just ride in the truck?" So, Commander Cheng handed his coat to the guard and agilely jumped into the soldiers' truck. At this time, the truck driver jumped out of the driver's cabin and earnestly said to the commander, "Please sit in the driver's seat!" Commander Cheng said, "It's okay, I've already sat down." The driver still earnestly said, "There's a lot of dust when driving, please sit in the driver's seat!" Commander Cheng said, "The top is good, the top can go sightseeing, tell stories, and sleep. I can't stand being locked in your little shed." He said with a smile, and the soldiers in the car also laughed, leaving the driver with no choice. The car started, and Commander Cheng and the soldiers talked and laughed, happily heading to the front line of bandit suppression.
    In the process of pursuing and annihilating bandits, life was very difficult, especially when the rear supply could not be supplied on time and entering the sandy beach without a single blade of grass, there was often a shortage of food and water. In this situation, Commander Cheng often endured hunger and thirst, and gave his own dry food and water to the soldiers to eat and drink. The guards were often anxious about this and often secretly stored a little dry food and water without Commander Cheng's knowledge, but once he found out, he would give it all to everyone. Once, the higher command brought him some wine and cigarettes, and he divided them into many portions and distributed them to other commanders and combatants. He often picked cow dung (the only fuel on the Gobi Desert) with the soldiers, looking for wild onions and wild garlic (rare vegetables in the barren mountains). All this was of great educational significance to the lower-level commanders and combatants. I remember that there was such a thing: there was a cook in the command post. Because he was from Guangdong, people jokingly called him "Old Guang." His movements were very slow, and the command post's meals were often eaten behind the troops. Because of this, it also caused some people to be dissatisfied with him, but he was still a little unconvinced and often retorted a few words to some comrades. Once, because the firewood was damp, the fire just wouldn't burn. A communications soldier said a few words to him, and he said with a flushed face, "You have the ability to try it!" Saying that, he sat down on the ground and simply didn't care about anything. Others burned for a long time, but it still wouldn't burn. Later, Commander Cheng found out about this, he came over to take a look and said, "Too much firewood is piled up, and the direction of the fire pit is not right!" Saying that, he was about to do it himself. At this time, the cook stood up uneasily and said, "Let me do it." Commander Cheng smiled and said, "Okay, I'll be your advisor." Under Commander Cheng's guidance, the fire quickly started, and the cook was also happy. At this time, Commander Cheng said to the cook again with interest, "Fighting a battle requires strategy and tactics, military actions require understanding of the key points, and making food also requires using your brain to study!" Although Commander Cheng said these words jokingly, they deeply moved the cook's heart. From then on, his movements became faster, partly because he had studied and had more methods, and partly because he was always worried that Commander Cheng would do it himself again.
    When the troops arrived at Beitashan, a sudden rainstorm came. Some comrades hurriedly hid in the stone caves. The stone caves were very small, and people were crowded together. Horses, grain, ammunition, and troops that continued to arrive were all being rained on. At this time, Commander Cheng rode his horse from behind. He decided to camp on the spot. After issuing the order, he immediately jumped off his horse, called a few comrades, and personally helped them set up tents. He was drenched all over. The guard repeatedly asked him to take shelter in the stone cave; however, he continued to work. The tents were quickly set up, and he went to urge the troops to set up tents. Under his influence, the people hiding in the stone caves ran out to set up tents one after another. One tent after another was quickly set up, and all the commanders and combatants avoided the rainstorm.
    Commander and Family
    In November 1949, the troops were preparing to enter Xinjiang from Jiuquan. Commander Cheng suddenly received a letter from home. This was an unexpected thing for Commander Cheng, because during the First Domestic Revolutionary War, his two elder brothers were killed by the Kuomintang one after another, his house was burned down, and his mother was forced to beg along the streets. He thought that his family had long ceased to exist. However, this letter told him: his mother was still alive, his two nephews had also grown up, and although the family's life was somewhat difficult, with the help of the People's Government, they could barely maintain it at present. Commander Cheng was very happy to read this letter, and told everyone about his hometown and mother. In his narration, I felt that he was full of love for his hometown and mother. Everything in his hometown, Shangchengjia Village, Huang'an County, Hubei Province, was as if it were in front of his eyes. Especially the few small houses leaning against the remote Maoshan Mountain, the cellar under the small houses, the rice fields in front of the door, and the road leading to the city on the high mountain opposite... made him even more nostalgic. Because after the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, the few small houses leaning against the remote Maoshan Mountain once became a stronghold for revolutionary underground activities. At that time, his two elder brothers were both Communist Party members, and the eldest brother was still the secretary of the central village branch. He was also a member of the Communist Youth League. Because the comrades of the county party committee often hid in his home to carry out revolutionary activities, they dug a cellar under the small house. In this cellar, leaflets were often printed, talking about revolutionary principles. At that time, he was often sent to guard the door, watching the road leading to the city on the high mountain opposite. Once there was any movement, he would quickly report it so that the county party committee comrades could hide or run away from the Maoshan Mountain behind. After a short period of time like this, the news of "attacking Huang'an City" spread. One day, he indeed received a notice from the higher authorities about attacking Huang'an City. He enthusiastically signed up to participate in this battle. Huang'an City was captured not long after, but was again occupied by Kuomintang bandit troops. The Kuomintang bandit troops carried out a cruel burning and killing in the surrounding villages. However, this did not extinguish the flames of revolution. Everyone temporarily hid their guns in the Butiao Mountains, and after the Kuomintang bandit troops returned to the city, they officially formed a people's guerrilla team. At that time, he was also one of the enthusiastic participants. At this time, he often heard the news of the Red Army's victory in the guerrilla team. He hoped to see this revolutionary army with his own eyes. Especially when his eldest brother was killed by the Kuomintang in 1929, his house was burned down, and his mother was forced to beg on the streets, he hoped to join this army sooner to avenge himself. His wish was finally realized. In 1930, their guerrilla team joined the Red Army and was officially reorganized into the Red Army. From then on, he officially became a strong and brave revolutionary soldier. In the battle to smash the enemy's "five encirclements and suppressions," he made many military achievements. Especially in smashing the enemy's fourth "encirclement and suppression," when his second brother gloriously sacrificed, making his hatred even deeper, he played a decisive role in a battle. This time, the higher authorities promoted him from deputy squad leader to platoon leader, awarded him a set of clothes with the "Lenin badge," and also allowed him to speak at the conference. Because he couldn't speak, he even cried in a hurry... All these memories made him feel even more that his hometown was lovely. His mother, his gray-haired mother, made him even more nostalgic.
    Speaking of his own mother, Commander Cheng told such a story: After the "Xi'an Incident" on December 12, because of the formation of the Anti-Japanese National United Front, the Red Army was changed to the "Eighth Route Army." The flags, clothes, cap badges, and armbands had to be changed. This caused great unease among some commanders and combatants, and he was also saddened by this matter. However, after the higher authorities explained, "This is to adapt to the changes in the situation and policies, and the essence of the revolutionary army will never change." Later, he calmed down. At that time, Commander Cheng wrote a letter to his mother about this matter. Because the letter did not explain it very clearly, he soon received a reply from his mother. His mother questioned him angrily, "Why have you changed? Do you really want to make me angry to death!" The letter also repeatedly instructed, "No matter how you change, your hearts cannot change! Your hearts must always be red! Remember, if your hearts change, don't come home, you are not my son!" These words have always been deeply imprinted in Commander Cheng's heart, and these words often act as a huge force, making him even braver. How lovely is such a strong mother! Now she is already eighty-three years old. In this letter, she also talked about how she had suffered all kinds of torture from the Kuomintang, but she was still a stubborn old woman. In today's liberated era, she did not propose to let her son go to see her. This increased Commander Cheng's nostalgia and love for her even more. However, Commander Cheng did not have the slightest intention of going home. Because he knew that being able to communicate with his family and learn about the family's situation was indeed a happiness earned through combat, but he believed that this was only the beginning of a happy life. In his words, it was, "There is finally a little bit of sweetness in my mouth." Therefore, he must continue to use combat to ensure this hard-won victory and strive for a permanent happy life. So, he quickly put down his memories of his hometown and mother, and led his troops to march towards the distant border of the motherland. After arriving in Xinjiang, he received a second letter from home. At this time, Commander Cheng was suppressing bandits in the Beitashan area. Yuan, the political commissar who stayed at home, saw from the letter that his family was having difficulties, so he asked the organization for instructions, requesting to give his family some help. The organization approved it, and in addition to giving fifty silver dollars, they also wrote a letter to the local government, asking them to take care of it. Commander Cheng returned from the front line, and Political Commissar Yuan happily handed him the letter; however, when Political Commissar Yuan handed him the money, he refused it, saying, "I should thank the organization for their concern and care for me; however, the money is not needed. The family's difficulties can be overcome with the help of the local government. This is the division of labor in the revolution." Political Commissar Yuan said, "Of course, it is. However, the organization's little care is also a little comfort to the family." Commander Cheng also said, "Every cadre and soldier of ours has a family. If everyone is like this, it will be a huge expense! Besides, the local government's care is already a great comfort." After saying that, Commander Cheng refused the money in any case. He always said, "There is local care and the division of labor in the revolution." At this time, Political Commissar Yuan looked at the letter again, thought for a moment, and said, "Judging from the letter, the local government has tried their best to take care of them, but I'm afraid that due to the current financial difficulties, their strength is still limited..." Before Political Commissar Yuan could finish speaking, Commander Cheng interrupted him, "It doesn't matter, the two nephews have already grown up. If these two young and strong guys can't support an old grandmother, it's unreasonable!" Saying that, he immediately started writing a letter to his two nephews, simply leaving Political Commissar Yuan with no opportunity to interrupt. After some time, the bandit situation basically subsided, and the work in the production area was also largely in order. Commander Cheng seemed to be a little more relaxed. The higher authorities had suggested to Commander Cheng that he could go home to see them if he had the opportunity. At this time, he was aroused by the idea of going home, and his longing for his hometown and mother became even deeper, and he also felt that his hometown and mother were even more lovely. The small house, Maoshan Mountain, rice fields, cellar, road in his hometown, as well as the strength and kindness of his elderly mother, often floated in his mind. However, at this time, he received a third letter from home: his mother had passed away! What unfortunate news this was for Commander Cheng! However, Commander Cheng did not hum, he suppressed the sadness in his heart and did not tell anyone. Because he estimated that if others knew about this matter, it would make the organization consider this issue again. He secretly borrowed money from the guard and two staff officers, plus his own two months' allowance, totaling 1,500 Xinjiang currency, and sent it home by airmail. The news was finally quickly known to everyone. At the division party congress, the party praised Commander Cheng's clean and honest revolutionary style, and the news spread throughout the division. All the commanders and combatants were deeply moved and educated by this matter.

    坚苦朴素的程悦长师长
    王玉胡
    简单的房间
    我走进了程悦长师长的房间。这房间的简单朴素给了我很深的印象。一所本来不大的房子隔成两间，一间是卧室，一间是办公室。办公室里只有一张长方形的办公桌，和几张破旧的沙发。书籍、文件整齐地分放在两个窗台上，各种报纸整齐地放在一个没有油漆的报架上。卧室更是狭小，妻子和小孩们的一张大床，和自己的一张小床几乎挤满了房间，再加上一些用具，这房间简直没有回旋的余地了。我看到这些情形，不由随口说道：“师长还是这样朴素啊！”程师长听了很不以为然地说道：“这算什么朴素，比起从前舒服得多了。战争的时候，在冰天雪地里睡觉，跷起腿就是办公桌，那还不是一样工作。”我说：“现在的环境不同了……”我的话还没有说完，程师长便打断了我的话。他说：“现在的环境还是必须坚苦奋斗的环境。正像毛主席告诉我们的：我们的革命才走了万里长征的第一步，我们必须保持坚苦奋斗的传统，才能换得长远的最后的幸福生活。”说到这里，程师长谈起有些同志，他们从外面回来，总喜欢谈论、夸耀那些大城市的高楼大厦，和华美精巧的家具和陈设，关于那里的斗争情况、工作经验，总很少提到。程师长对这种情形感到很痛心，并严肃激动地说道：“我们这些同志，应该说他忘了本！忘了过去的战斗和今天的任务，忘了广大群众的生活水平和戈壁滩上生产的战士，忘了为革命牺牲的烈士们！”说到这里，他回忆着，并且讲着很久以前的
    一些老战友的英勇牺牲的情形，沉痛地说：“当时，这些同志无论在那方面都比我强得多，可是他们不幸牺牲了！他们为了什么呢？还不是为了大家的长远的最后的幸福生活！现在距离长远的最后的幸福生活还很远，而我们就想享起福来，这怎么能对得起那些牺牲的同志们呢！”程师长的话打动着我，像是又把我带到烈焰腾空、子弹纷飞的战场上，使我又一次受到战斗的考验和教育。
    两条破旧的棉被
    我走进了程师长的卧室，因为没有凳子，我顺便在床铺上坐下来。这狭小的房间，首先引起我注意的是一条破旧的棉被。我看了又看，好像对它非常熟悉。我不由问道：“这还是一九四八年打宝鸡的胜利品吧？”程师长听了笑了笑，说道：“呵！你还认识它呢。”我也笑着说：“也不太认识了，这草绿被面快洗成白的了。”这时，程师长又笑着说道：
    “这个胜利品快成为纪念品了，盖着它就永不会忘记过去的战斗。”这两句话好像很平常，可是却在我的脑子里打起转来；我觉得这里面包含着很深的意思。这使我联想到：一九四六年在陕甘宁边区的时候，也是为了他的一条破旧的棉被，他也曾说过类似今天的话。那条被子是一九四○年由太行山抗日根据地带回陕甘宁边区的，一直盖到一九四六年；当时已经破烂不堪。供给部曾屡次说要给他补充一条新的，可是却一次一次地被他拒绝了。直到全师指战员普遍补充了一条棉被时，他才要了一条。记得，这件事情曾发生了很大的影响，因为当时正是日本投降以后，在不少同志的意识里，滋长着一种和平麻痹、“下山享福”的思想。程师长这种坚苦朴素的作风，曾像警钟一样，使大家清醒起来……想到这里，我不由说道：“师长，你还记得张村驿
    （陕甘宁边区的一个地方）那条被子吗？”程师长听了说道：“记得，所以……”说到这里，他指着这条在宝鸡缴获的旧棉被继续说：“它还能盖好几年啊！”戒纸烟和其他
    从前程师长吸烟很多，特别在工作繁忙和考虑问题的时候，几乎是一根接一根地吸；因此也曾使他害着很严重的咳嗽病。为了这一点，别人也曾劝他少吸一些；但是，过多吸烟似乎已成为一种习惯，很难改变了。前些时候，我到程师长家里，他拿出纸烟来招待我，可是他却一枝也不吸了。我奇怪地问道：“师长不吸烟了吗？”程师长说道：“花费太大，戒掉了。”我听了说道：“吸烟能花多少钱呢？”程师长紧接着说：“可是不少啊！全部的津贴费、保健费还不够呢！”我说：“差不多少吧？”程师长略微思索了一下说：“按说应该差不多少了，可是，人心不足啊。”我听了最后一句话，似乎有一点摸不着头脑，程师长大概也看出我有些茫然的神色，于是，便对我解释说：“你还记得吗？咱们打榆林（地名）的时候，草烟叶找不到，只好弄来树叶子当烟吸，那时不也过去了吗？后来，能抽到纸烟，那怕是最坏的纸烟也是宝贝。可是现在纸烟多了，就挑选起来，不好的吸不上口了。前些日子，我算了算账，每个月的纸烟费已超过我应开支的数字，要再这样下去，就得违反制度。所以我决心戒掉，再不吸烟了。这样，对我的身体也有好处。”他这一番话，深深地打动了我，使我感到他在任何一个小的地方，都是这样严格地要求自己。这使我忆起了他的一些往事：
    记得在战争的年代里，每当他的伙食好一点的时候，他便告诉炊事员们：“千万不要超过供给标准啊！”有一次，他知道菜金已经超过了供给标准，可是炊事员又买来一只鸡，于是，他严厉地对炊事员说：“供给标准超过了，那里还有钱买鸡呢！”炊事员说道：“不怕，我有办法。”程师长有些生气地说道：“你有什么办法！花的钱如果记在我程悦长的名下，用我一个月的津贴恐怕也还不清。”炊事员听了，不由笑道：“怎么能让首长出钱呢，我是说……”师长不容他说完，便命令道：“还有什么说的！”炊事员本来想说明：这个月的亏空，可由下月的菜金补上。可是，程师长不容分辩地打断了他的话，使他无可奈何地把鸡退给了原主。当时，炊事员似乎还有一点不高兴，可是，事后一想：程师长为了什么呢？还不是为了遵守供给制度，为了替人民节省吗？想到这里，便由一时不悦的心情，又变成对程师长的敬爱。
    记得也是在战争的时候，那是部队休整期间，他的妻子从后方带着孩子们来了。两个孩子的衣服，已经破烂得不像样子，他的妻子曾想让组织上帮助解决一下这个问题；可是，程师长不同意：“全师的孩子多着呢！如果都让组织上特殊照顾，组织上照顾得起吗？”后来，他看着孩子们的衣服实在穿不出去了，便暗自借了警卫员的一丈多布，为孩子缝了两件衣服。其实，程师长很爱孩子们，他很注意对孩子们的思想性格上的教养。比如：他常常给孩子们讲着打仗的故事。看戏的时候，像对大人
    一样，给孩子们讲解着戏剧的内容，甚至像小孩子
    一样地同他们打闹。但是他厌恶对自己的孩子有什么特殊的照顾。特殊照顾会养成孩子们本来没有的虚荣、享乐等观念，对于培养他们上进、自立、勤劳等性格上，会有很不好的影响。
    和士兵同甘苦
    “和士兵同甘苦”是程师长一贯的作风，也是他带兵的一条原则。这方面的事情太多了，我想只举进入新疆以后，在剿灭乌斯满匪徒时，我所亲眼看到的几件小事。
    战士们的汽车要发动了，程师长的吉普车的司机跑来问程师长：“发动车子吧？”程师长听了，说道：“还发动什么车子，大汽车不是一样能坐吗？”于是，程师长把大衣交给警卫员，敏捷地跳上了战士们的汽车。这时，大汽车的司机跳出司机棚，恳切地向师长说：“请到司机台坐吧！”程师长说：“好了，我已经坐好了。”司机仍恳切地说：“走起来灰尘很大，还是坐司机台吧！”程师长说：“上面好，上面能游山观景，能摆‘龙门阵’，还能睡觉，关在你那小棚棚里，我可受不了。”他说着笑了，车上的战士们也笑了，闹得司机也没有办法。汽车开动了，程师长和战士们又说又笑，高高兴兴地奔向剿匪的前线。
    在追歼匪徒的过程中，生活非常艰苦，特别当后方补给不能按时供应和进入没有一根草木的沙滩时，时常闹着粮荒、水荒。在这种情形下，程师长时常忍着饥、渴，把自己带的干粮和水，交给战士们吃、喝。警卫员为了这件事常常心焦，并时常瞒着程师长偷偷储蓄一点干粮和水，可是一旦被他发现，便统统拿来发给大家。有一次，上级指挥部给他捎来了一些酒和纸烟，他均分了很多份，分给其他指挥员和战斗员。他时常和战士们一同拾牛粪
    （戈壁滩上唯一的燃料），寻找着野葱、野蒜（荒山中难得的菜蔬）。这一切，都对下级指挥员和战斗员有很大的教育意义。记得曾有这样一件事情：指挥部有一个炊事员，因为他是广东人，人们都以开玩笑的口吻叫他“老广”。他的动作很迟缓，指挥所的饭常常吃在部队的后面。为了这一点，也曾引起一些人对他的不满，可是他还有一点不服气，时常和一些同志顶几句。一次，因为柴草潮湿，火横竖烧不着，有一个通讯员说了他几句，他便红着脸说道：“你们有本领来试试看！”说着一屁股坐在地下索性什么也不管了。别人烧了半天，也是烧不着。后来，这事情被程师长知道了，他走过来看了看，说道：“柴草堆得太多了，火坑的风向也不对头！”说着就要亲自动手。这时，炊事员很不安地站起来了，说道：“还是我来吧。”程师长笑了笑说：“好，我来给你当参谋。”在程师长的指点下，火很快地烧起来了，炊事员也高兴了。这时程师长对炊事员又凑趣地说道：“打仗要有战略战术，做军事动作要懂要领，做饭这玩意儿也得要用脑子钻研啊！”程师长虽然是开玩笑地说了这几句话，却深深地打动了炊事员的心。从此以后，他的动作迅速起来了，一方面因为他经过钻研，办法多了，一方面他总耽心程师长再亲自动手。
    部队到了北塔山，暴雨突然来了。有些同志急忙躲到石洞里。石洞很小，人拥挤着。马匹、粮秣、弹药和继续到达的部队，都淋着雨。这时，程师长骑着马从后面跑来了，他决定就地宿营。他下达了命令以后，立刻跳下马来，喊来几个同志，亲自和他们一起搭帐篷。他淋得浑身是水，警卫员一再请他到石洞里避一避；可是，他仍然继续工作。帐篷很快搭好了，他又去督促部队搭帐篷。在他的影响下，躲在石洞里的人都纷纷跑出来搭帐篷。一顶顶帐篷很快地搭起来了，全体指挥员和战斗员避过了暴雨的侵袭。
    师长和家庭
    一九四九年十一月间，部队正准备从酒泉进入新疆。程师长忽然接到一封家信。这对程师长是一件意外的事，因为在第一次国内革命战争时，他的两个哥哥先后被国民党杀死，房子被烧毁，母亲被逼得沿街乞讨，他以为他的家庭早就不存在了。可是这封家信却告诉他：母亲还活着，两个侄儿也长大了，家里的生活虽有些困难，但在人民政府的帮助下，眼前还可以勉强维持。程师长非常高兴地看着这封信，并对大家讲起故乡和母亲的故事。在他的讲述中，使我感到：他充满着对故乡和母亲的热爱。故乡，湖北黄安县上城家村的一切，就像摆在他的眼前。特别是背靠偏僻茅山的几间小房，小房下的地窖，门前的稻田，对面高山上通向城里的大路……更使他怀恋。因为当一九二七年大革命失败以后，背靠偏僻茅山的几间小房，曾一度成为革命地下活动的据点。当时他的两个哥哥都是共产党员，大哥还是中心村的支部书记，他也是共产主义青年团的团员。因为县委的同志经常隐蔽在他的家里进行革命活动，便在小房下面挖了一个地窖，在这个地窖里经常印着传单，讲着革命的道理。当时他经常被派到门口放哨，望着对面高山通向城里的大路，一旦有什么动静，便很快报告，好让县委同志们藏起来，或者从后面的茅山跑开。这样过了不久，“攻打黄安城”的消息传开了。一天，果然接到了上级关于打黄安城的通知，他踊跃报名参加了这次战斗。黄安城打开不久，又被国民党匪军占去。国民党匪军对四乡进行了残忍的烧杀。可是这并没有把革命的火焰平熄，大家暂时把枪藏在布条山里，等国民党匪军回城以后，便正式组成了人民游击队。当时，他也是踊跃参加的一个。这时，在游击队里经常听到红军的胜利消息，他希望亲眼看到这支革命军队。特别当一九二九年，大哥被国民党杀死，房子被烧毁，母亲流落街头乞讨时，他更希望早一天参加这支军队去报仇雪恨。愿望终于实现了。一九三○年他们的游击队和红军会合了，并正式改编为红军。从此，他正式成为一位坚强勇敢的革命战士。在粉碎敌人“五次围剿”的战斗中，曾立过不少战功，特别在粉碎敌人的第四次“围剿”中，也是他二哥光荣牺牲使他仇恨更深的时候，他曾在一次战斗中起了决定作用。这一次上级把他由副班长提升为排长，并奖给他一套有“列宁章”的衣服，还让他在大会上讲话。他因为讲不出话来，还急得哭了一场……这一切回忆，使他更感到故乡的可爱。母亲，头发花白的母亲，更使他怀念。
    说到自己的母亲，程师长讲了这样一个故事：西安“双十二”事变以后，因为抗日民族统一战线的组成，红军改为“八路军”，打的旗子，穿的衣服，戴的帽徽、袖章，都要改换。这曾引起一些指挥员和战斗员的很大不安，他也曾为这事伤心。可是经上级解释：“这是适应时局和政策的变化，革命军队的本质是永远不会变的。”以后，也就心平气和了。当时，程师长曾把这件事写信告诉母亲。因为信上没有交代得十分清楚，不久便接到母亲的回信。母亲气愤地质问他：“你们为什么变了呢？真要把我气死！”信上也反复地嘱咐着：“不管怎么变，你们的心是不能变的！你们的心要永远是红的！记住，要是你们的心变了，就不要回家，就不是我的儿子！”这些话一直深深地印在程师长的心里，这些话也常常像一种巨大的力量，使他更加勇敢。这样坚强的母亲是多么可爱呀！现在她已经是八十三岁的人了。在这次来信中，也曾说到她怎样受尽了国民党的折磨，可是她仍然是一位倔强的老人。在解放后的今天，她并没有提出让儿子去看看她。这更增加了程师长对她的怀念和热爱。可是程师长却丝毫没有引起回家的念头。因为他知道能够和家庭通信，了解到家庭的情况，这确实是一种用战斗换来的幸福，可是他认为：这不过是幸福生活的开始，照他的话是：“嘴里总算刚刚有一点甜味了。”因此还必须用战斗来保证这已得的胜利，争取永久的幸福生活。于是，他很快地放下对故乡和母亲的回忆，带着队伍向遥远的祖国边疆挺进了。到达新疆以后，他收到了第二封家信。这时程师长正在北塔山一带剿匪。留在家里的袁政委，从信上看到他的家庭生活有困难，便请示组织，要求给他的家庭
    一些帮助。组织上批准了，除发给五十块白洋，还给地方上写了信，请地方上加以照顾。程师长从前线回来了，袁政委很高兴地把信交给他；可是当袁政委把钱交给他时，却被他拒绝了，他说道：“我应该感谢组织对我的关心和照顾；可是钱是不需要的。家里的困难有地方政府帮助克服就行了。这是革命的分工。”袁政委说道：“当然是这样。可是组织上的一点照顾，对家里总算也是点安慰。”程师长又道：“咱们每个干部、战士都是有家的，如果都这样，要好大的开支呀！再说，地方上的照顾，已经是很大的安慰了。”说来说去，程师长横竖不要这笔钱，他总是说“有地方上照顾，有革命的分工”。这时，袁政委又看了看信，思考了一下说道：“从信上看来，地方政府是尽力照顾了，恐怕由于当前财政困难，力量还是有限的……”没等袁政委说完，程师长便截断了他的话：“这不要紧，两个侄儿已经长大了。他们这两个年青力壮的小伙子，要是养活不起一个老祖母，是说不过去的！”说到这里，他马上给两个侄儿写起信来，简直使袁政委没有插话的机会。过了些时候，匪情基本上平息了，生产地区的工作，也已大体就绪。程师长似乎也稍微轻松了些。上级曾向程师长提出：有机会可以回家去看看。这时，他曾激起回家的念头，对故乡和母亲的怀念更加深了，也更觉得故乡和母亲可爱了。故乡的小房、茅山、稻田、地窖、大路，以及年老的母亲的坚强、慈祥的面孔，也时常在脑子里浮现。可是，就在这时，他接到了第三封家信：他的母亲逝世了！这对程师长是多么不幸的消息！可是程师长没有哼声，他压制着内心的悲伤，没有告诉任何人。因为他估计，如果让别人知道了这件事，又会使组织上来考虑这个问题。他暗暗地借了警卫员和两个参谋的钱，再加上自己两个月的津贴费，一共凑了一千五百元新疆币，用航空信寄回家去。这消息终于很快被大家知道了，在师党代表大会上，党对程师长廉洁奉公的革命作风进行了表扬，这消息传遍了全师。全体指挥员和战斗员都深深地为这件事受着感动和教育。
