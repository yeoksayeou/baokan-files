    The Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project in Jiwei Successfully Tested
    The Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project in the plains of the province along the lower reaches of the Yellow River successfully completed its test run on March 12th, and will officially release water for irrigation in April. This marks the first time in history that water has been diverted from the lower reaches of the Yellow River for irrigation, representing a great beginning in transforming the lower Yellow River into a beneficial river.
    The Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project involves constructing a canal head gate on the north bank of the Yellow River, west of the Yellow River Railway Bridge of the Beijing-Hankou Railway; a main canal, approximately 100 li long, will be built from the canal head gate northwards along the Beijing-Hankou Railway to the Wei River near Xinxiang; from the main canal, four branch canals will be extended. Upon completion of the entire project, it will be able to irrigate 360,000 to 450,000 mu of farmland in Xinxiang, Huojia, Yanjin, and Ji County, and it will also be possible to divert water from the Yellow River through the canals to supplement the Wei River, ensuring that the Wei River can maintain navigation for 200-ton steamships even during the dry season.
    The project was originally scheduled for completion in 1953. In July of last year, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, in order to coordinate with this year's grain and cotton production increase campaign, divided the project into two phases. The first phase was scheduled to release water in April of this year, initially irrigating 230,000 mu of farmland. Construction began in August of last year, and by the end of last year, thanks to the diligent efforts of the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project Office and tens of thousands of laborers, the first phase of the project had been completed ahead of schedule, guaranteeing the timely release of water in April.
    The lower reaches of the Yellow River are prone to siltation due to the rapid flow of water from the upper reaches, which carries sediment downstream; moreover, long-term disrepair under the corrupt rule of feudalism and the Kuomintang reactionary government further exacerbated the problem, so it has always been considered a harmful river. Particularly in the provinces of Pingyuan and Henan, the Yellow River has historically caused the most severe damage. The Yellow River dikes in this section are known as "tofu waist." In the past, the seven major course changes of the Yellow River all occurred at breaches in this section. Because this section of the Yellow River dikes is most prone to breaches and floods, and because the river channel changes significantly every year, making water diversion difficult, it has always been considered impossible to open canals and divert water in this section to irrigate farmland.
    However, after the establishment of the People's Government, the historical face of the Yellow River has been completely transformed. Since 1946, when the people took control of this section of the Yellow River, no major disasters have occurred due to the mobilization of the masses of farmers on both banks to strengthen repairs. After the nationwide liberation, especially after the release of water from the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project in Jiwei, the broad masses of farmers can use the water of the Yellow River to irrigate farmland. This project will not only transform the area near Xinxiang into a fertile grain and cotton producing region crisscrossed by canals, but more importantly, it tells us a truth: under the leadership of the People's Government, relying on the strength of the broad masses, even a thousand-year-old harmful river like the Yellow River can be transformed into a beneficial river serving the people.

    Strictly Prevent Wheat Sawfly from Harming Wheat Seedlings
    Recently, a large number of wheat sawflies (also known as small armyworms) have been found in wheat fields in Daokou Town, Hua County, Puyang Special District, Pingyuan Province. Local people caught hundreds of thousands of them in one day. This insect occurred in the suburbs of Beijing and in local areas of Hebei, Shandong in 1950, causing considerable damage. Therefore, major wheat-producing areas in Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong and other provinces should immediately conduct thorough inspections and carry out work to catch sawflies, collect eggs, and eliminate larvae.
    The wheat sawfly is a small black wasp with a reddish-yellow thorax, about three to four fen in body length. The larva is blue-green in color, with a black head, and grows to a length of six to seven fen. The insect overwinters as a pupa in the soil, and transforms into a small wasp in mid-to-late March of the following year. It saws holes in wheat leaves to lay eggs, laying eggs while sawing, forming a string along the veins of the leaf. After ten days or more, the eggs hatch into larvae. The larvae eat wheat seedlings from early April to early May. Initially, the insect body is small and the amount of food it consumes is limited, so the damage is not obvious. As the insect body gradually grows larger, the damage becomes more and more serious. During the day, they hide under the lower part of the wheat stalks or curl up in the soil near the roots, and come out at night to eat wheat leaves (they also come out to eat wheat leaves on cloudy days), so they are easily overlooked. After the fourth instar, the amount of food increases and the damage is very severe. At this time, prevention and control are laborious and the effectiveness is small. If you are not careful, it will cause losses. The prevention and control methods are: (1) Conduct frequent and thorough inspections. (2) Use insect nets to catch small wasps. (3) Collect and destroy wheat leaves with eggs. (4) At dusk, hold a dustpan under the middle of the wheat seedlings, and use a broom to sweep the insects into the dustpan, sweeping as you go, and repeat this for several days. When the wheat seedlings are short (before stem elongation), a wooden handle can be tied to the dustpan to push and catch the larvae on the upper part of the wheat seedlings. (5) Kill the larvae during the day in the lower part of the wheat seedlings or near the roots. At present, all localities must conduct thorough inspections, and if this pest is found, they should quickly mobilize the masses and make full use of the various methods created by the local people to eliminate this pest.

### 引黄灌溉济卫工程试水成功

    引黄灌溉济卫工程试水成功
    黄河下游平原省境内的引黄灌溉济卫工程，已在三月十二日试水成功，四月间将正式放水灌田。这是有史以来第一次在黄河下游引水灌田，使黄河下游变为利河的一个伟大开端。
    引黄灌溉济卫工程是在黄河北岸、京汉铁路黄河铁桥西侧建筑引水的渠首闸；从渠首闸向北，沿京汉铁路到新乡附近的卫河，开一条长约一百华里的总干渠；从总干渠再分出四条干渠。这个工程全部完成后，可以灌溉新乡、获嘉、延津、汲县的三十六万亩到四十五万亩农田，并可以从渠道引入黄河水量接济卫河，使卫河在枯水期间也能经常保持二百吨汽船的航运。
    这个工程原计划要在一九五三年完成。去年七月，中央人民政府水利部为了配合今年粮棉增产运动，把这个工程分为两期进行，第一期工程要在今年四月放水，首先灌溉二十三万亩农田。从去年八月开始动工，到去年年底，在引黄灌溉济卫工程处和数万民工的辛勤努力下，第一期工程已全部提早完成，保证了今年四月按期放水。
    黄河下游因上游流水湍急，挟带泥沙倾泻而下，极易淤积；加以在过去长期封建主义和国民党反动政府的腐败统治下长久失修，因此一向被视为害河。特别是在平原和河南境内，过去是黄河为害最严重的地段。这一段黄河堤岸，素有“豆腐腰”之称。过去黄河七次大改道，都是在这一段决口的。由于这一段黄河堤最易决口泛滥，加以河槽每年变化很大，引水不易，因此要在这一段开渠引水，灌溉农田，过去一向视为不可能的事情。
    但是，在人民政府成立以后，黄河的这个历史面貌就完全改观了。自从一九四六年这段黄河被人民控制后，由于发动两岸农民群众加意培修，便没有发生一次大的灾害，全国解放后特别是在引黄灌溉济卫工程放水后，广大农民可以利用黄河的水灌溉农田了。这个工程不仅将使新乡附近变成一个沟渠纵横的丰饶的粮棉产区，而且更重要的是它告诉我们
    一条真理：在人民政府的领导下，依靠广大群众的力量，即使像黄河这样的一条千年害河，也是可以使它变成为服务于人民的利河。
    严防麦叶蜂为害麦苗
    最近平原省濮阳专区滑县道口镇的麦田里发现大批麦叶蜂（又名小黏虫），当地群众一天内就捉到数十万个。这种虫一九五零年曾在北京市郊区和河北、山东的局部地区发生过，造成了相当大的损失。因此，河北、平原、山西、河南、山东等省主要产麦区应即严密检查，进行捕蜂、采卵和灭除幼虫的工作。
    麦叶蜂是一种黑色小蜂，胸部红黄色，体长三、四分。幼虫青绿色，头黑色，长大时体长六、七分。它们头年由虫成蛹，在土下越冬，在第二年三月中下旬化为小蜂，在麦叶上锯孔产卵，边锯边产，沿着叶的脉旁侧连成一串，经过十天或十多天，孵化成幼虫。幼虫在四月初到五月上旬吃麦苗。最初虫体不大，食量有限，为害不显著。以后虫体渐大，为害逐渐严重。它们白天躲在麦秆下部或蜷伏在近根的土中，夜晚出来吃麦叶（在阴天的日间也会出来吃麦叶），因此容易被人忽视过去。四龄以后，食量加大，为害很烈，这时防治，费力大，收效小，稍不注意，就会造成损失。防治方法是：（一）经常严密检查。（二）用捕虫网兜捕小蜂。（三）采毁有卵的麦叶。（四）黄昏时拿簸箕托着麦苗中部，用扫帚把虫扫入箕内，边走边扫，连日进行。在麦苗矮小时（没有抽茎），可用木柄绑在簸箕上，向麦苗上部推捕幼虫。（五）白天在麦苗下部或近根部分捕杀幼虫。目前各地必须严密检查，如发现这种害虫，就应迅速发动群众，充分运用当地群众创造的各种方法来消灭这种害虫。
