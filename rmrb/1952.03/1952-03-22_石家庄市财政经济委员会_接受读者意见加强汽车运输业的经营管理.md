Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    Shijiazhuang Municipal Finance and Economics Committee
    Accepts Readers' Opinions to Strengthen the Management of the Motor Transport Industry
    To the Editor: Li Tao's letter, published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on February 23rd, exposing the illegal activities of the private motor transport industry in Shijiazhuang and suggesting that the People's Government stop them, is entirely correct. We have held several meetings to study solutions to the illegal activities of the private motor transport industry, but the problem has been delayed until now without being resolved. This is a serious manifestation of bureaucratic work style. Now, we have formulated motor vehicle management measures, combined with the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement, to improve the management of the city's motor transport industry and bring it into line. We express our gratitude to Comrade Li Tao for his active suggestions.    Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    石家庄市财政经济委员会
    接受读者意见加强汽车运输业的经营管理
    编辑同志：二月二十三日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了李涛同志的来信，揭发石家庄市私营汽车运输业的违法行为，并建议人民政府加以制止，这是完全正确的。对于私营汽车运输业的违法行为，我们曾经开过几次会议，研究解决办法，但问题拖延至今，还没有解决，这是一种严重的官僚主义作风。现在，我们已制定了汽车管理办法，结合反贪污和反盗窃运动，改善本市汽车运输业的经营管理，使之纳入正轨。对李涛同志的积极建议，我们表示感谢。    石家庄市人民政府财政经济委员会
