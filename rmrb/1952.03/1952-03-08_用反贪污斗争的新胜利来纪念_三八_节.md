    Commemorate "March 8th" International Women's Day with New Victories in the Anti-Corruption Struggle
    Hao Jianxiu
    The great "March 8th" International Women's Day has arrived. Women all over the world are commemorating this great day for the struggle for women's liberation. It is of even greater significance that we, the women of New China, commemorate this festival in the midst of the vigorous anti-corruption and anti-theft movement.
    Since the national liberation, Chinese women have enjoyed equal political, economic, and cultural status and rights with men. Our vast number of female workers and sisters are also actively engaged in production, just like male workers. Many female labor models have emerged in both heavy and light industries. Our female spinning workers in cotton mills have also improved their working methods, increased their ability to watch over machines, and reduced the amount of roller waste, saving and creating a large amount of wealth for the motherland. For the final victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship led by our working class, and to strive for a better future, we are working tirelessly, without wasting a single thread or an ounce of cotton, using all our material and spiritual strength to build our beloved motherland.
    However, the profit-seeking bourgeoisie are frantically attacking our working class and the democratic regime led by our working class in an organized and planned manner. They place spies in government organs and state enterprises, stealing a large amount of state wealth; they use all kinds of despicable methods to corrupt revolutionary cadres and divide the unity of the working class, attempting to usurp leadership; they use all kinds of shameless methods to evade national taxes. Take our Qingdao City as an example, the big profiteer Li Xuecai bought over forty lackeys in the Qingdao branch of the East China Textile Administration Bureau and various state-owned cotton mills in Qingdao to serve him, systematically stealing state property. It is estimated that the amount of tax evasion by the Qingdao business community last year was at least equivalent to the value of more than one hundred airplanes, more than four times the twenty-five airplanes they donated last year. Even more abominable is that many profiteers have even stolen a large amount of national resources for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and secretly harmed our most beloved volunteers.
    At the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I heard Chairman Mao's instruction: The people of the whole country should "increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers." When I think of Chairman Mao's words, I hate those illegal capitalists and corrupt elements even more. We must not watch the fruits of victory won by the blood and sweat of our people being destroyed by illegal capitalists and corrupt elements.
    Therefore, when we commemorate "March 8th" this year, I hope that all of us women, all our female workers and sisters, should carefully review our strength, organize our strength, and actively participate in the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle. Sisters who work in state-owned enterprises must eliminate the corrupt elements they know and completely capture the spies and lackeys of the bourgeoisie. Sisters working in private enterprises must break with the illegal capitalists and launch face-to-face struggles. The broad masses of staff and workers' families must mobilize their husbands and sons with corrupt behavior to thoroughly confess their mistakes and strive for their return to the ranks of the working class. We must commemorate "March 8th" International Women's Day with new victories in the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle.

### 用反贪污斗争的新胜利来纪念“三八”节

    用反贪污斗争的新胜利来纪念“三八”节
    郝建秀
    伟大的“三八”国际妇女节来到了，全世界妇女都在今天来纪念这个争取妇女解放斗争的伟大节日。我们新中国的妇女，在轰轰烈烈的反贪污、反盗窃运动中来纪念这个节日，有更重要的意义。
    中国妇女在全国解放以后，在政治上、经济上和文化上，都有了和男子平等的地位和权利。我们广大女工姐妹，也和男工一样在积极生产。不管在重工业部门或轻工业部门，都出现了不少妇女劳动模范。我们棉纺织厂细纱女工姐妹，也改进了工作方法，提高了看车能力，减少了皮辊花，为祖国节省和创造了大量财富。为了抗美援朝的最后胜利，为了巩固我们工人阶级领导的人民民主专政，为了争取美好的将来，我们不浪费一根纱，不浪费一两棉花，手不停脚不停地工作，把一切物质的和精神的力量都用来建设我们可爱的祖国。
    可是，唯利是图的资产阶级，却在有组织有计划地猖狂地向我们工人阶级进攻，向我们工人阶级领导的民主政权进攻。他们安置坐探到政府机关和国家企业内，大量盗窃国家的财富；他们用尽各种卑鄙的办法腐蚀革命干部、分化工人阶级的团结，企图篡夺领导权；他们用种种无耻的办法偷漏国家的税款。就拿我们青岛市来说，大奸商李雪才在华东纺织管理局青岛分局机关和青岛各国营棉纺工厂里，收买了四十多个走狗给他服务，有计划地盗窃国家的资财。青岛工商界去年一年偷漏税收的数字，估计至少等于一百多架飞机的价值，超过他们去年所捐献的飞机二十五架的四倍以上。更可恶的，还有许多奸商竟大量盗窃全国人民抗美援朝的资财，并且暗害我们最可爱的志愿军。
    我在政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上，听到了毛主席的指示：全国人民应该“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”。我想起毛主席这些话，就更加痛恨那些违法资本家和贪污分子。我们决不能看着我们全国人民流血流汗换来的胜利果实，受到违法资本家和贪污分子的破坏。
    所以在今年纪念“三八”节的时候，我希望我们全体妇女，全国女工姐妹们，应该好好检阅我们的力量，组织我们的力量，积极参加反贪污、反盗窃的斗争，在国营企业中工作的姐妹们，要把自己所知道的贪污分子肃清，把资产阶级的坐探和走狗完全捉出来。在私营企业作工的姐妹们，要和违法资本家撕破脸，展开面对面的斗争。广大的职工家属们，要动员自己有贪污行为的丈夫、儿子彻底坦白悔过，争取他们回到工人阶级的队伍中来。我们要用反贪污、反盗窃斗争的新胜利来纪念“三八”国际妇女节。
