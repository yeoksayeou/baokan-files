    We Have Obtained Ironclad Evidence of American Germ Warfare
    Brandweiner
    I have the honor of being the head of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team. The investigation team has completed its investigation in Korea and is now compiling a report. Next week we will go to the Northeast to investigate the situation of bacteriological weapons being dropped in Chinese territory.
    We have specifically investigated the facts of the American military conducting germ warfare in Korea. We have obtained evidence regarding this fact.
    In recent weeks, unprecedented types of insects have been discovered in many areas of Korea. Judging from the local temperature, the density of insects, the soil type, and other factors, as well as the appearance of insect containers after American planes flew around, it proves that these insects were scattered from the air in heaps or clusters. Experts have found that most of these insects carry cholera, typhus, plague, and other germs. Faced with these irrefutable facts, we are extremely shocked.
    As a professor of international law, I must say that this is clearly a case of war crimes, and at the same time, it is a crime not only against the military but also against humanity. Germ warfare is expressly prohibited by international law: the Hague Convention prohibits the use of poisonous weapons, and the 1925 Geneva Protocol expressly stipulates the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. As a member of the World Peace Council, I must also point out that the peace movement, which represents the common will of peace-loving people all over the world, has stipulated the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons. The Nuremberg and Far East International Military Tribunals have declared the use of bacteriological weapons a crime. The "Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide" adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948 has also affirmed this.
    We hope that our investigation work will contribute to the heroic Korean people and the great Chinese people who are fighting for peace, freedom, and justice.

    我们获得了美国进行细菌战的铁证
    布兰德魏纳
    我荣幸地做了国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的团长。调查团已经完成了在朝鲜的调查工作，现在正在整理报告。下星期我们要到东北去调查细菌武器投掷在中国境内的情形。
    我们曾经特别调查了美国军队在朝鲜进行细菌战的事实。我们已经获得了关于这一事实的证据。
    在最近几周内，朝鲜许多地区发现了从未有过的这一种和那一种的昆虫。从当地的气温、昆虫密集情况、土壤类型以及其他因素和美国飞机在飞旋之后就有昆虫容器出现等情形看来，证明这些昆虫是成堆地或成团地从空中撒落下来的。专家们已经查出这些昆虫大部分带有霍乱、斑疹伤寒、鼠疫和其它病菌。面对这些无可辩驳的事实，我们实在是惊骇万分。
    作为一个国际公法的教授，我必须说，这显明地是战争罪行的案件，同时，这又不仅是残害军队，而且是残害人类的罪行。细菌战是国际公法明文禁止的：海牙公约禁止使用有毒的武器，一九二五年的日内瓦议定书明文规定禁用细菌武器。作为世界和平理事会的一员，我又必须指出：代表全世界爱好和平人类的共同意愿的和平运动已经规定禁止使用细菌武器。在纽伦堡和远东国际军事法庭已经宣布使用细菌武器是一种罪行。一九四八年联合国大会通过的“防止并惩办集体屠杀罪公约”，也已经予以确定。
    我们希望我们的调查工作对于为和平、自由和正义而斗争的英勇的朝鲜人民和伟大的中国人民有所贡献。
