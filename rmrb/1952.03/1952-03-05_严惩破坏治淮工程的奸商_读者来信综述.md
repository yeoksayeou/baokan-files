    Severely Punish奸商 Who Sabotage the Huai River Project
    —Reader Letters Summary
    Readers from various regions continue to write to this newspaper, demanding that the People's Government severely punish 奸商 who steal state assets and sabotage the Huai River project.
    Wu Chengxin and Lu Ruixing, students of the East China Public Security Cadre School, said: "We are from Tongcheng County, Northern Anhui. We have seen the tragic situation of our compatriots on both sides of the Huai River, who suffered from floods caused by Chiang Kai-shek's dyke breaching, lacking clothing and food. We have also heard the tearful accusations of the disaster victims. Anyone with a little humanity hates the disasters that Chiang Kai-shek inflicted on the people. When Chairman Mao issued the great call to 'definitely harness the Huai River,' we rushed around, telling the disaster victims the news, and we embraced each other with tears in our eyes. As the good news of the Huai River harnessing came, we were even more confident, thinking: The people on both sides of the Huai River will be able to turn the swamp into a paradise, and will be able to eradicate historical disasters and live a happy life forever. How could the inhumane奸商 Sun Yingcai and others want to sabotage the Huai River project? What is the difference between this and Chiang Kai-shek's crime of breaching the dyke and harming the people!"
    Huang Zhongxian, Zhang Xingmin, Li Cunhou, and Yao Dinglai, from the Changtaiguan Hydrological Station of the Engineering Department of the Huai River Commission, wrote: "In order to collect data for the Huai River project, we braved all difficulties and went to test during the flood season, and we observed day and night in the wind and rain. However, because the current meters, stopwatches, thermometers, anemometers and other hydrological instruments we used were defective, we encountered many difficulties in the testing work, and the testing results lost their due accuracy. These hydrological data can be said to be the lifeline of the people on both sides of the Huai River. But illegal capitalists disregard the life and death of the people and sell us bad instruments, attempting to sabotage our water conservancy construction."
    Zhou Fang, of the Northern Anhui Youth League Huai River Work Committee, said in a letter about the situation in the Huai River work: "The Huai River project has not only received support from all over the country, but also our great ally, the Soviet Union, has sent Comrade Bukov, a highly revolutionary and friendly water conservancy expert, to personally help us. Comrade Bukov still worked day and night when he was overworked and had serious eye problems. Our own worker brothers have worked under steel plates of more than 110 degrees; farmers have gone into the water to break the ice in the severe cold of minus 15 degrees. However,奸商 conduct sabotage with 'profit above all else'."
    Ning Juchuan, Guo Wenzheng, and others from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Xiang Zhongquan, Jiang Jueguang, Li Qinghua and others, students of the Tangshan Institute of Technology of Northern Jiaotong University who interned in Runheji and other places last year, expressed in their letters: The奸商 who sabotage the Huai River project are the deadly enemies of the people, and we cannot tolerate them. We firmly demand that the People's Government swiftly and severely punish these奸商. And we ask the People's Government to continue to inspect, and be sure to thoroughly eliminate all奸商 and thieves who harm the Huai River project.

    严惩破坏治淮工程的奸商
    ——读者来信综述
    各地读者继续写信给本报，要求人民政府严惩盗窃国家资财，破坏治淮工程的奸商。
    华东公安干部学校学员吴诚信、陆瑞星说：“我们是皖北桐城县人。我们曾经看过淮河两岸的因蒋匪决堤而遭受水灾的同胞们衣单食缺的凄凉透顶的景况，而且也听到过灾胞们一字一泪的控诉。凡稍有人性的人，莫不痛恨蒋匪给予人民的灾祸。当毛主席发出‘一定要把淮河修好’的伟大号召时，我们奔走如飞，把这个消息告诉灾胞，和灾胞相互拥抱，大家都掉下热泪来。当着治淮的捷音传来时，我们更是信心百倍地想着：淮河两岸人民将可把泽国变为乐园，将可以根绝历史性的灾难而过着永世无疆的幸福日子。岂知灭绝人性的奸商孙英才等，却要破坏治淮工程，这与蒋匪决堤淹害人民的罪行有何差别！”
    治淮委员会工程部淮河上游长台关水文站黄仲贤、张醒民、李存厚、姚鼎来信说：“为了收集治淮工程的资料，我们曾不顾一切困难，在洪水时期去测验，曾日夜不停地在风雨中观测。但是，由于我们用的流速仪、马表、温度计、风速计等水文测验仪器是坏货，在测验工作中遭受了很多困难，并且使测验成果失了应有的准确性。这些水文资料，可以说是淮河两岸人民的命脉。可是不法资本家竟不顾人民的死活，把坏仪器卖给我们，企图破坏我们的水利建设。”
    青年团皖北治淮工作委员会周方在信中谈到治淮工作中的情况时说：“治淮工程不但获得了全国各地的支持，而且我们伟大的盟邦苏联也派来了有高度革命友谊的水利专家布科夫同志，亲自帮助我们。布科夫同志在工作过度、眼病严重的时候，仍然日以继夜地工作。我们自己的工人弟兄，曾在一百一十多度的钢板下工作；农民们曾在零下十五度的严寒中下水破冰。然而奸商们却‘利润高于一切’地来进行破坏。”
    中国人民解放军某部宁巨川、郭文政等和去年曾在润河集等地实习过的北方交通大学唐山工学院学生项忠权、蒋爵光、李庆华等，在信中表示：破坏治淮工程的奸商，是人民的死敌，我们不能容忍。我们坚决要求人民政府迅速严惩这些奸商。并要求人民政府继续检查，一定要把为害治淮工程的一切奸商、盗贼彻底肃清。
