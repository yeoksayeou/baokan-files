    Extravagance and Waste by Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Cadres While Watching the Tide Last Year
    Comrade Editor: The General Office of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government launched a "tide-watching movement" last year, wasting a large amount of state property.
    In August of last year, the General Office of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government organized a large-scale "tide-watching movement." Before watching the tide, responsible cadres from the General Office and relevant units held special meetings to study and prepare for the tide-watching event. All cadres at or above the prefectural committee level in Hangzhou received three tide-watching tickets each (for their wife, son, and themselves). In addition to using all the cars in Hangzhou, ten large trucks were rented from the Zhejiang Provincial Transportation Company (at a rental fee of more than 960,000 yuan per truck). On the day of the tide-watching, the Public Security Bureau was responsible for guarding the more than 100-li road from Hangzhou City to Haining County, with sentries every five steps and posts every ten steps, and a motorcycle team was dispatched, truly "heavily guarded." In addition, militiamen, women, and children along the road were mobilized to stand guard. All this was to "ensure the safety of the leaders watching the tide." After watching the tide, a lavish meal was held. The masses reflected, "We have never seen such a big scene before. So many cars going to watch the tide, what a waste!" I believe that the relevant leading authorities should deeply examine this matter.
                                                                                                                    Ling Feng

    浙江省人民政府干部去年观潮时铺张浪费
    编辑同志：浙江省人民政府办公厅在去年发动了“观潮运动”，浪费了国家大量资财。
    去年八月，浙江省人民政府办公厅主持了一次大规模的“观潮运动”。在观潮之前，办公厅负责干部和有关单位，曾经召开专门会议，研究、筹备观潮事宜。凡是在杭州的地委一级以上的干部，每人发三张观潮票（妻子、儿子和本人）。除了使用杭州所有的小汽车外，又向浙江省交通公司租用大卡车十辆（每辆租费九十六万多元）。观潮那天，从杭州市到海宁县，沿途一百多里路上，由公安厅负责，五步一哨、十步一岗，并且出动了摩托车队，真是“警卫森严”。另外，还动员了沿公路的民兵、妇女、儿童放哨。这样，为的是“保卫首长观潮的安全”。观潮之后，又大吃一顿。群众反映说：“过去从没看过这样大场面。这样多汽车去看潮，多么浪费！”我认为有关领导方面应该深刻检讨这件事。  凌风
