    Protest Against British Imperialism's Killing of Our Residents in Hong Kong

    The British imperialists' illegal persecution of our residents in Hong Kong is becoming increasingly serious. Following the illegal arrest and expulsion of our film artists and Kowloon disaster victim representative Si Ma Wensen, Li Wenxing and others in January this year, the Hong Kong British authorities dispatched a large number of military police on the first of this month to systematically and deliberately massacre local Chinese residents; and after creating this bloody atrocity, they massively arrested our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. We absolutely cannot tolerate this barbaric and brutal crime of British imperialism in arresting and persecuting our patriotic compatriots, and we must lodge a serious protest with the British authorities in Hong Kong.

    After the incident of the Hong Kong British authorities' continuous arrest and expulsion of our residents in January this year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government issued a statement on January 25, lodging a serious protest with the British government, and demanding that the British government must immediately stop such atrocities; at the same time, various Chinese people's organizations also issued a joint statement, severely condemning the British imperialists' reactionary atrocities in Hong Kong, and expressing their determination to be the strong backing of the People's Government, and preparing to resolutely combat the vicious conspiracy of American and British imperialism to harm our country. Now, the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities not only do not repent, but instead intensify their efforts to plan and stage a bloody tragedy of arresting and killing our residents. This fully demonstrates that British imperialism is continuing to obey the will of the United States, deliberately persecuting the Chinese people in Hong Kong, in an attempt to realize its conspiracy to turn Hong Kong into a base for imperialism to invade our country. The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong have waged and are continuing to wage a resolute struggle against this persecution and conspiracy of British imperialism. Their spirit of loving the motherland and opposing the atrocities of imperialism has won the unanimous admiration and full support of the people of the motherland.

    The anger of the Chinese people is unstoppable; the Chinese people cannot but warn the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong: you must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences caused by your provocative acts against the people of the great People's Republic of China in Hong Kong; you must know that the great Chinese people will not allow anyone to arbitrarily bully them. If you continue to act willfully and do not stop the provocative atrocities of persecuting and killing Chinese residents in Hong Kong, you will definitely be met with devastating defeat in the face of the great power of the Chinese people.

    抗议英帝国主义捕杀香港的我国居民
    英帝国主义在香港非法迫害我国居民的暴行是越来越严重了。香港英国当局继今年一月间非法连续逮捕和驱逐我国电影艺术工作者及九龙灾民代表司马文森、李文兴等人之后，竟在本月一日出动大批军警，有计划、有布置地屠杀当地我国居民；并在制造了这个血腥暴行之后，大规模地逮捕我国在香港的爱国同胞。英帝国主义捕杀与迫害我爱国同胞的这种野蛮残暴的罪行，是我们所决不能容忍的，我们要向香港英国当局提出严重的抗议。
    在今年一月间香港英国当局连续逮捕和驱逐我国居民的事件发生之后，我中央人民政府外交部曾于一月二十五日发表声明，向英国政府提出严重抗议，并要求英国政府必须立即制止这类暴行；同时我国各人民团体也曾发表联合声明，严厉地斥责了英帝国主义在香港的反动暴行，并表示誓为人民政府后盾，准备坚决打击美英帝国主义危害我国的毒辣阴谋。现在，英国政府和香港英国当局不但不思悔改，反而变本加厉地布置并演出了捕杀我国居民的血腥惨案。这充分表现了英帝国主义是在继续顺从美国的意旨，蓄意迫害香港的我国人民，以图实现其把香港变为帝国主义侵犯我国的基地的阴谋。香港的我国爱国同胞对于英帝国主义的这种迫害和阴谋，曾进行了并且还在继续进行着坚决的斗争。他们热爱祖国、反对帝国主义暴行的斗争精神，得到了祖国人民的一致敬佩和全力支持。
    中国人民的愤怒是不可遏止的；中国人民不能不警告英国政府和在香港的英国当局：你们对于你们在香港向伟大的中华人民共和国人民的挑衅行为所造成的严重后果，一定要担负全部的责任；你们要知道，伟大的中国人民是不容任何人任意欺侮的，假如你们还要继续一意孤行，不停止迫害和捕杀香港中国居民的挑衅暴行，你们就一定会在中国人民的伟大力量面前碰得头破血流。
