Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to Vietnam News Agency reports: The Vietnam Workers' Party issued a letter to the entire country's military, civilians, and party members on the 2nd. The full text is as follows:

Dear compatriots, soldiers, and comrades!

March 3rd is the anniversary of the Vietnam Workers' Party's announcement of its establishment to the people of the whole country, the anniversary of the unification of "Viet Lien" and "Viet Minh," and March 11th is the anniversary of the unity of the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.

March 3rd is a historically significant, joyful, and glorious day of great victory for the Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese working class, and the Vietnamese working people.

This historically significant anniversary once again demonstrates the great role of the Party, the national united front, and the alliance of the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and strengthens our confidence in achieving final victory in the struggle against the French colonialists and American interventionists. We are deeply convinced that we will achieve this victory because our struggle relies on the power of the great national people's united front, the close unity of the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and the enthusiastic support of peace-loving people all over the world. This is also because our resistance war is being carried out according to the correct line of the revolutionary party, which takes Marxism-Leninism as its guide and is absolutely loyal to the interests of the motherland and the people, and because our resistance war is led by the great leader of the Party and the people, President Ho Chi Minh.

Over the past year, the situation of the resistance war has become more tense and fierce than before. However, relying on the broad unity of the people of the whole country based on the solid alliance of workers, peasants, and mental laborers, and relying on the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, we have been able to overcome all difficulties and have achieved many brilliant victories in the military, political, economic, financial, and cultural fields. From north to south, whether in the liberated areas, enemy-occupied areas, or guerrilla areas, whether on the front lines or in the rear, the military and civilians of the whole country are enthusiastically launching competitive movements to kill the enemy and perform meritorious deeds, increase production, pay agricultural taxes, and do all kinds of work beneficial to the resistance war. Throughout the country, especially on the front lines and behind enemy lines, our comrades wholeheartedly and single-mindedly fight for the motherland and the people, resolutely organize, unite, and lead the people to participate in the resistance war, and play an active leading role in implementing the policies of the Party and the People's Government. Although some party members have not been able to fulfill the tasks entrusted to them by the motherland, the resistance war, and the people, and these party members are not "diligent, thrifty, honest, and just" and "completely selfless." They have been infected with bad ideological styles such as corruption, waste, bureaucracy, and commandism, and they have not been able to follow the mass line well. These party members should be determined to transform themselves, correct their mistakes, and bravely overcome their shortcomings. The Party will educate them, and at the same time, the Party sincerely asks the compatriots to strictly criticize them and help them make progress.

Dear compatriots, comrades, and comrades! The past year has been difficult, but it has achieved brilliant victories. Especially in the past three months, our heroic People's Army has won many victories one after another on the northern battlefield. We attacked Phát Diệm, Bắc Ninh, Bắc Giang, Phủ Lý, Nam Định, completely liberated Hòa Bình, wiped out the enemy's effective strength, liberated millions of compatriots, and expanded and consolidated the guerrilla areas and guerrilla bases behind enemy lines. This series of victories has had a great impact at home and abroad. The plan of the enemy's invasion ringleader, Taschini, has been shattered, and the enemy's so-called "autumn-winter offensive" has been defeated. However, the more the enemy suffers defeats, the more frantic, brutal, and cunning they become. They collude with reactionary forces at home and abroad in an attempt to prolong their war of aggression. Today, as we celebrate the anniversary of the founding of the Party and the unification of "Viet Lien" and "Viet Minh," the Party calls on the people of the whole country, all soldiers, and all party members to actively launch a campaign to kill the enemy on the front and behind enemy lines on the basis of the new victories we have achieved, to eliminate more of the enemy's effective strength in the north and other battlefields, and to smash the enemy's sinister plot of "using war to support war" and "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese," so as to push the resistance war onto the road to victory.

The Party especially calls on the compatriots, soldiers, and party members in the enemy-occupied areas and guerrilla areas to strengthen guerrilla warfare, consolidate guerrilla bases, expand and consolidate the grassroots organizations of the people, and prepare to smash the enemy's various crazy mopping-up operations. Being able to do these tasks well means that we have been able to actively spend the stalemate stage, cultivate and accumulate our own strength, and then practically prepare for the arduous task of the general counter-offensive.

Today, as we celebrate the anniversary of the founding of the Party and the unification of "Viet Lien" and "Viet Minh," the Party once again reminds the people of the whole country, all soldiers, and party members to always keep in mind that our resistance war will surely be victorious, but it must go through a long and arduous struggle process; at the same time, we must also remember at all times that we should rely on our own efforts, rely on the strength of the people, and overcome any difficulties. We must be good at cultivating and accumulating our own strength in order to win the final victory. Therefore, the Party calls on the military and civilians of the whole country and party members to resolutely implement the instructions of President Ho Chi Minh and the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, and to do everything possible to vigorously launch campaigns to increase production and practice economy and oppose corruption, waste, bureaucracy, and commandism in government organs, people's troops, and factories and villages. The Party calls on the compatriots, soldiers, and party members of the whole country to strengthen the unity of the people of the whole country and oppose all the enemy's deceptive slanders and divisive conspiracies. Comrades should especially focus on consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, because the worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of the national united front. We must further devote our efforts to enthusiastically supporting the anti-aggression struggles of the peoples of Cambodia and Laos. At the same time, we must closely join hands with the working people of France and the people of French colonies, and closely unite with the Soviet Union, China, Korea, and the people's democratic countries. Combine our resistance war with the struggle of the world's peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, oppose the imperialist groups that incite war, defend world peace and democracy, and combine true patriotism with proletarian internationalism.

The above tasks are lofty and arduous. In order to accomplish this task well, each of our party members should constantly strive to improve. Therefore, this year the Central Committee of the Workers' Party will especially focus on rectification work, calling on all party members and cadres to immediately launch movements to study theory, transform their thinking, cultivate revolutionary morality, unite and help the masses outside the Party to progress. Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Party Central Committee, the people of the whole country will unite and fight to the end.

Comrades, bravely move forward! The final victory will surely belong to our people.

Long live the Vietnam Workers' Party!

Long live the Vietnam National United Front!

The peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos unite more closely to defeat the French colonialists and American interventionists!

Actively fight to defend lasting world peace and democracy!

The long-term resistance war will surely be victorious!

Long live independent and unified Vietnam!

Long live President Ho Chi Minh!

Vietnam Workers' Party

    庆祝越南劳动党建党周年等纪念日
    劳动党发表告全越军民和党员书
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社消息：越南劳动党在二日发表告全国军民和党员书，全文如下：亲爱的同胞们，战士们，党员同志们！
    三月三日是越南劳动党向全国人民宣布成立的纪念日，是“越联”和“越盟”统一的纪念日，三月十一日是越南、高棉、寮国三国人民团结的纪念日。
    三月三日是越南全国人民、越南工人阶级、越南劳动人民的一个具有历史意义的、愉快的、赢得重大胜利的光荣日子。
    这个具有历史意义的纪念日，再一次地说明了党的，民族统一战线的，越南、高棉、寮国三国人民联盟的巨大作用，并加强了我们在反对法国殖民者和美国干涉者的斗争中必定获得最后胜利的信心。我们所以深信必能获得这个胜利，是因为：我们的斗争是依靠伟大的全国人民统一战线的力量，依靠越南、高棉、寮国三国人民紧密的团结，依靠全世界爱好和平的人民对我们热烈的支援。这也是因为我们的抗战是按照以马克思—列宁主义为指南针的、绝对忠诚于祖国和人民的利益的革命政党的正确路线来进行的，因为我们的抗战是由党的和人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席来领导的。
    一年来，抗战形势比以前更为紧张激烈。但依靠以工人、农民和脑力劳动者的巩固联盟为基础的全国人民的广泛团结，依靠党和人民政府的领导，我们已能克服一切困难，并进而在军事、政治、经济、财政、文化等方面获得许多辉煌的胜利。从北到南，不论在解放区，敌占区或游击区，不论在前线或在后方，全国军民都正在热烈地展开杀敌立功、增加生产、缴纳农业税和各种对抗战工作有利的竞赛运动。全国各地，特别是在前线和在敌后，我们的同志全心全意为祖国、为人民而坚决地战斗，全力组织、团结和领导人民参加抗战，在执行党和人民政府的政策时起了积极的带头作用。虽然其间尚有部分党员还不能够完成对祖国、对抗战、对人民所交付的任务，这一部分党员还不够“勤俭廉正”和“大公无私”。他们染上了贪污、浪费、官僚主义、命令主义等恶劣的思想作风，他们还不能很好地走群众路线。这一部分党员应该下决心改造自己，纠正错误，勇敢克服自己的缺点。党会教育他们，同时党诚恳地要求同胞们严格地批评他们，帮助他们进步。
    亲爱的同胞们，战友们，同志们！过去的一年虽然是艰苦的，但却取得了辉煌的胜利。特别是最近三个月来，我们英勇的人民军已一次紧接一次地在北部战场上赢得许多胜仗。我们进攻了发艳、北宁、北江、府里、南定，完全解放了和平，消灭了敌人的有生力量，解放了成百万的同胞，扩展和巩固了敌后的游击区和游击根据地。这一连串的胜利在国内外起了很大的影响。前敌军侵略头子塔西尼的计划被粉碎了，敌人的所谓“秋冬攻势”已被击溃了。但是，敌人愈是遭受失败，就愈加疯狂、残暴和狡诈。他们勾结国内外反动势力，企图苟延他们的侵略战争。今天我们庆祝党的成立和“越联”与“越盟”统一的纪念，党号召全国人民、全体战士、全党党员，在已获得新的胜利的基础上，在正面的战场和敌后的战场上积极展开杀敌运动，在北部和其他的战场上，要争取更多地消灭敌人的有生力量，粉碎敌人“以战养战”、“利用越南人打越南人”的恶毒阴谋，进而把抗战推向胜利的道路。
    党特别号召在敌人占领区和游击区的同胞们、战士们和党员们加强游击战争，巩固游击根据地，扩展和巩固人民群众的基层组织，准备粉碎敌人的各种疯狂的扫荡。能够做好这些工作，就是说我们已经能积极地度过相持阶段，培养与积蓄自己的力量，进而切实地准备总反攻的这一艰巨的任务。
    今天庆祝党宣布成立和“越联”与“越盟”统一纪念，党再一次地提醒全国人民、全体战士和党员们要时刻紧记着：我们的抗战一定会胜利，但必须经过长期艰苦的斗争过程；同时也要时时刻刻地记着：我们应该自力更生、依靠人民的力量，克服任何艰难困苦，我们要善于培养和积蓄自己的力量以争取最后胜利。因此，党号召全国军民和党员要坚决执行胡志明主席和劳动党中央委员会的指示，竭尽一切力量在政府机关、人民部队和工厂与乡村中，强有力地展开增产节约和反对贪污、浪费、官僚主义、命令主义等运动。党号召全国同胞们、战士们和党员们加强全国人民的团结，反对敌人的一切欺骗诽谤和挑拨离间的阴谋。同志们要特别着重于巩固工农联盟，因为工农联盟是民族统一战线的基础。对高棉和寮国两国人民的反侵略斗争，我们要更进一步竭尽心力地热烈地予以支援。与此同时，我们也要紧密地和法国劳动人民与法属殖民地的人民携起手来，和苏联、中国、朝鲜以及各人民民主国家密切地团结起来。把我们的抗战和以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的斗争结合起来，反对煽动战争的帝国主义集团，保卫世界和平与民主，把真正的爱国主义和无产阶级的国际主义结合起来。
    上述的任务是崇高而艰巨的，为了很好地完成这项任务，我们每个党员应不断地努力上进。因此，今年劳动党中央委员会要特别着重整训工作，号召全体党员和干部立即展开理论学习、改造思想、培养革命道德、团结和帮助党外的群众进步等运动。在胡志明主席和党中央的领导下，全国人民团结起来战斗到底。
    同志们勇敢地前进吧！最后的胜利一定是属于我们人民的。
    越南劳动党万岁！
    越南国民联合战线万岁！
    越南、高棉、寮国三国人民更密切地团结起来打败法国殖民者和美国干涉者！
    为保卫世界持久和平与民主而积极战斗！
    长期抗战一定胜利！
    越南独立统一万岁！
    胡志明主席万万岁！
    越南劳动党
    一九五二年三月二日
