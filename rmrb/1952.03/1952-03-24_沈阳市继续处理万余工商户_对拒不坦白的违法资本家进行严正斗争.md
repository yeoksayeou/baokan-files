Xinhua News Agency Report: Shenyang City – Following the first round of case settlements for industrialists and businessmen by the sub-committees of the various district’s Thrift Examination Committees, another 11,353 industrial and commercial households were announced to have had their cases settled over the course of three days on the 18th, 19th, and 20th. In this round of case settlements, all districts adopted the experiences of the first round, continued to mobilize workers, and boldly utilized activists. Some district inspection teams adopted a "industry contracting system," combining inspections of key households to comprehensively promote inspection and settlement work across entire industries, thereby greatly improving work efficiency. The process for settling cases for this batch of industrialists and businessmen in each district was as follows: first, gathering industrialists and businessmen to study and discuss policies, submit confessions, followed by mutual checks and comparisons, and review and approval; then, convening labor-capital face-to-face reasoning and struggle sessions for workers to review; after worker review and approval, the district Thrift Examination Committee would conduct final verification, review, and approval. Due to the full mobilization of workers in various industries, they reviewed the confession materials of industrialists and businessmen with a positive and responsible spirit at the reasoning and struggle sessions, and questioned their illegal activities. Industrialists and businessmen who failed to pass the previous review recognized that it was difficult to deceive the eyes of the people and that only a thorough confession could lead to case settlement, so they all provided good accounts of their problems this time. Additionally, some illegal industrialists and businessmen, although having slipped through the self-reporting and public discussion meetings of their respective industries, had to supplement much of what they tried to conceal under the supervision of workers and accountants.

Among the industrialists and businessmen whose cases have been settled, most are basically law-abiding households, and some are law-abiding or partially law-abiding/partially illegal households. The People's Government will issue separate notices. This case settlement was handled according to the principle of "leniency for those who confess, severity for those who resist." Hejihao was originally a semi-law-abiding/semi-illegal household, but because the capitalist handed over false accounts and exposed others, it was treated as a basically law-abiding household. Wang Youwen, the manager of Jirentang, a Chinese medicine business, had serious illegal activities, including tax evasion and theft of state property, gaining illegal profits of over 100 million yuan. However, after repeated education, he not only confessed his illegal activities but also exposed the illegal facts of two other capitalists, and was therefore also treated leniently, being assessed as a semi-law-abiding/semi-illegal household, required only to make supplementary payments without penalty. At the announcement meetings, each district conducted a stern struggle against illegal capitalists who refused to confess. The Shenhe and Heping districts arrested two major thieves on the spot who refused to confess. At the same time, each district called on illegal industrialists and businessmen whose cases have not been settled to continue to reflect, emphasizing that as long as they thoroughly confess, they can still receive lenient treatment.

    沈阳市继续处理万余工商户
    对拒不坦白的违法资本家进行严正斗争
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：沈阳市各区节约检查委员会分会继第一批对工商业者的结案处理后，又先后在十八、十九、二十日三天宣布对一万一千三百五十三户工商业者的结案处理。在这次结案处理工作中，各区都接受第一批结案工作的经验，继续发动职工，大胆使用积极分子。有些区的检查工作队采取“行业包干制”，结合着对重点户的检查，全面地推动整个行业的检查和结案工作，工作效率因而大大地提高。各区对这批工商户的结案处理过程是：先集合工商业者学习，讨论政策，提出坦白书，经互查互比、审查通过；召开劳资见面说理斗争会，由职工审查；职工审查通过后，最后由区节约检查委员会对证、审查和批准。由于充分发动了各行业职工，他们在说理斗争会上，都以积极负责的精神审查了工商户的坦白材料，并追问了他们的违法行为。上次没有能通过的工商户，认清了实难混过人民的眼睛，只有彻底坦白，才能结案，所以这次都很好地交代问题。另有一些违法工商业者，虽然混过了本行业的自报公议会，但在工人、会计的监视下不得不纷纷补充许多企图隐瞒的问题。
    这批已结案的工商业者中，大部分是基本守法户，还有一部分守法户、半守法半违法户。人民政府将分别发给通知书。这次结案是根据“坦白从宽，抗拒从严”的原则分别处理的。合记号本为半守法半违法户，因资方交出假账并检举了别人，所以按基本守法户处理。中药业济人堂经理王幼文有严重违法行为，曾偷税及盗窃国家财产获得非法利润一亿元以上。但他经过多次教育后，不仅坦白了自己的违法行为，并检举了两个资本家的违法事实，因而也受到宽大处理，被评为半守法半违法户，补退不罚。各区在宣布处理大会上，对拒不坦白的违法资本家进行了严正的斗争。沈河、和平两区当场逮捕了两名拒不坦白的大盗窃犯。同时，各区并号召未结案的违法工商业者继续反省，只要彻底坦白，仍可受到宽大处理。
