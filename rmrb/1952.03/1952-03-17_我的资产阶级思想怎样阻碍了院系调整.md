How My Bourgeois Ideology Hindered the Departmental Adjustment
Chen Shihua, Head of the Civil Engineering Department, Peking University

Since liberation three years ago, higher education in Beijing and Tianjin, under the direct leadership of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Education, has made considerable improvements in administrative and teaching work. However, in most schools, the leading ideology of the working class has not been fully established, and the corrupt ideology of the bourgeoisie has not been eliminated. This has led to various obstacles in curriculum reform and departmental adjustments, preventing the proper implementation of the People's Government's correct policies.

Due to my mind being filled with bourgeois ideological toxins and using old viewpoints and methods to deal with new things, I made many intolerable mistakes in educational work. After the vigorous unfolding of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and after the exposure by teachers and students in my department, I realized the seriousness of the mistakes I had made in the past.

In the work of departmental adjustment, I had serious selfish, individualistic, and sectarian ideas, which brought great harm to the people's education cause.

Before liberation, various universities and colleges competed with each other, fearing their scale was not large enough. School administrative leaders tried their best and by any means to compete for funding, seize materials, and attract professors, fully demonstrating the characteristics of bourgeois ideological leadership. Due to the contradictions of personal interests between the schools, they could not help but engage in sectarianism, praising their own melons as sweet and falsely saying others' melons were bitter.

After liberation, such higher education, which did not meet the needs of the people, could certainly not stand. In order to use educational funds economically, to rationally use limited teachers, and to train more talents for national construction, the policy of departmental adjustment is completely correct and must be implemented. However, when the Central People's Government's Ministry of Education put forward such a policy, because I had serious individualistic and sectarian ideas, my first consideration was not how to earnestly implement this policy, but to consider that if myself or the department I led were adjusted to other schools, that would simply be a great loss of face and damage to personal dignity. In particular, I worried that my position and faction might suffer losses due to the departmental adjustment. Therefore, a psychology of resistance to departmental adjustment was generated, and several reasons were fabricated as a strategy to negate this correct policy, attempting to achieve personal ulterior motives.

At that time, I once proposed: the country urgently needs economic construction talents. Schools are places to train talents; more schools mean more places to train talents. And I emphasized that each school has its own history and tradition of development. If they are forcibly merged, it will not only affect the development of the original schools, but may also cause disunity among the cadres. Also, because the Engineering College of Peking University had the possibility of moving to another location at that time, I felt that I had been entrenched here for many years and was deeply rooted. Once the environment changed, my personal position might be affected. At the same time, the material conditions and the conditions for my children's schooling in other regions were not as good as in Beijing; furthermore, I would be unfamiliar with the place, and social activities would be greatly restricted. Therefore, I proposed: the number of existing universities and colleges in China is absolutely insufficient and far from meeting objective needs. Therefore, in terms of distribution, it is not that coastal areas are too dense, but that inland areas are too sparse. If our higher education is to be developed, we should add new schools in the inland areas instead of merging schools in coastal areas into the inland areas. Not one of these series of lies did not proceed from personal interests. After the merger of the agricultural colleges of Tsinghua University, Peking University, and North China University, because teachers engaged in sectarianism, formed small cliques, and were not united, I used this fact as an excuse to prove the impropriety of departmental mergers. How despicable is this selfish behavior!

Under the New Democratic education system, the old-style universities could no longer "develop freely"; at the same time, several new-style universities were building school buildings, hiring teachers, and adding equipment, growing vigorously, which made me feel even more that "heroes have no place to display their talents," and I was very depressed. Therefore, I fantasized that the school I was in could also magically transform into a new-style university. And the only way to magically transform was through merger and adjustment. Later, I heard that several heads of aviation departments had been severely criticized by teachers in their departments for opposing the adjustment, and I felt that it was no longer possible to resist the adjustment or merger. However, merger was incompatible with my sectarian ideas. But factions can be divided into large factions and small factions. In a last resort, one can only sacrifice the small faction to strive to maintain the large faction. The two civil engineering departments of Tsinghua University and Peking University were of the same nature, the exchange of teachers was very frequent, and most of the teachers were either classmates or friends. Therefore, the merger of the two departments was more in line with the ideal of sacrificing the small faction to maintain the large faction. At the same time, through the merger of the two departments, teachers and equipment could be expected to overwhelm everything. Therefore, before the Central People's Government's Ministry of Education convened a meeting in early April of last year to discuss the departmental adjustment, I and Mr. Xia Zhenhuan, the head of the civil engineering department of Tsinghua University at that time, agreed on a preliminary proposal for the separate merger of the two departments. After this proposal was agreed upon by the teachers at the joint symposium of the two departments, it was formally submitted to the Central People's Government's Ministry of Education. I privately said to Mr. Xia: "Only if we propose a merger plan first can we stop other possible plans of the Ministry of Education." That is to say, I was afraid that the civil engineering departments of Peking University and Tsinghua University could not be merged, but would be merged with the civil engineering departments of other schools, which would hinder my shameful attempt to maintain the faction.

The plan for the separate merger of the civil engineering departments of Peking University and Tsinghua University was welcomed by the leadership. However, this plan was not implemented. This was because the Central People's Government's Ministry of Education at that time might have been limited by the budget and did indeed say that "merger is good, but it is impossible to add school buildings." Since it was impossible to add school buildings, the merger of the two civil engineering departments was impossible. However, in fact, whether or not school buildings were added was not the decisive condition for hindering the merger; it is said that the main reason was that the separate merger plan of the two departments caused considerable opposition from factionalists, so the Central Ministry of Education had to retain the suggestion of separate merger of the two civil engineering departments on the grounds of overall consideration. What might we have gained through this farce? I think the first is the guarantee that Vice Minister Qian Junrui made in his speech at the inauguration of President Ma Yinchu of Peking University that the two schools of Peking University and Tsinghua University would not consider merging. At that time, I thought that if this could be done, not only could the large faction be maintained, but also the small faction could be maintained. Second: even if merged, the two departments had said in advance that they would never merge with the civil engineering departments of other schools, then at least the large faction could still be maintained.

Peking University is a university directly led by the Central People's Government's Ministry of Education and occupies a very high position among universities and colleges throughout the country. Its every move is watched by universities and colleges throughout the country. And I treated the departmental adjustment with such an extremely unpromising attitude of resistance, which undoubtedly affected the departmental adjustment work throughout the country. More seriously, I also attempted to obstruct the departmental adjustment work of other schools. For example, there was a proposal to move Tongji University to Dalian. I had already looked at the school site in Dalian. When President Xia Jianbai of Tongji University came to Beijing, I told him that the leadership's instructions on departmental adjustment were to advance steadily. I hoped to influence President Xia to strengthen his resistance to the departmental adjustment work. I also cited at a meeting the fact that some famous professors of Tongji University wanted to leave Tongji University because they were unwilling to move schools, hoping to use this to undermine the courage of the leadership. The fact that the national departmental adjustment has been slow to implement is inseparable from the obstruction of us factionalists.

So, how much harm did the delay of the departmental adjustment bring to the motherland? Just take Peking University and Tsinghua University as an example, if the civil engineering departments of the two schools had been adjusted earlier last year, according to the estimated number of students that could be enrolled this year, at least four hundred more students in civil engineering could have been enrolled in this year. Such a number is equivalent to more than 30% of this summer's civil engineering graduates nationwide. Also, if each class is calculated at an average of 50 people, 400 new students would require eight civil engineering departments to bear. This means that the failure to adjust the two civil engineering departments of Tsinghua University and Peking University has invisibly caused the country to lose six civil engineering departments.

My serious selfish, individualistic, and sectarian ideas have thus affected the development of the people's education cause. As a people's teacher, I still have such corrupt bourgeois ideological toxins in my mind, which has caused such an unforgivable sin. Fortunately, Chairman Mao launched the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, which saved me and made me completely sober, realizing my own ugliness. Thinking even more about the volunteers who resisted the U.S. and aided Korea, who were fighting arduously for the motherland and international justice under such difficult conditions, while I was hiding in an ivory tower, doing selfish things that harmed the motherland. I have disgraced the glorious title of "People's Teacher"! I feel that my only way out is to resolutely and thoroughly liquidate my serious bourgeois decadent thoughts, correct my past mistakes, and return to the people's ranks, and under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, work hard to move forward.

    我的资产阶级思想怎样阻碍了院系调整
    北京大学土木系主任  陈士骅
    解放三年以来，北京、天津的高等学校，虽然在中央人民政府教育部直接领导之下，在行政和教学工作上，都有了相当的改进；但是在大多数学校中还不曾把工人阶级的领导思想完全树立起来，而资产阶级的腐朽思想则未加清除，以致课程改革、院系调整等工作遇到了种种阻挠，使人民政府的正确政策不能很好地贯彻实施。
    由于我的思想中还充满着资产阶级的思想污毒，用旧的观点和方法，去处理新事物；因此，在教育工作中犯了很多不能容忍的错误。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动轰轰烈烈地展开以后，经过我系师生的揭发，使我认识到我过去所犯的错误的严重性。
    在院系调整工作中，我有严重的自私自利、个人主义和宗派思想，以致给人民教育事业带来极大的危害。
    在解放以前，各高等学校彼此竞争，摊子惟恐不大；学校行政领导人费尽心思地、不择手段地去争经费，抢物资，拉教授，充分地表现了资产阶级思想领导的特色。而各校之间因为个人利益的矛盾，就不能不闹宗派；只夸自己的瓜甜，还要违心地说别人的瓜苦。
    解放以后，这样不合人民需要的高等教育，当然不能立足了。为了经济地使用教育经费，为了合理地使用有限的师资，为国家培养更多的建设人才，院系调整的方针是完全正确和必须加以贯彻的。但是当中央人民政府教育部提出这样的方针以后，因为我存在着严重的个人主义和宗派主义思想，首先考虑的不是如何认真执行这一方针，而是考虑自己或自己所领导的系，如被调整到其他的学校去，那简直是大丢面子、伤害个人尊严的事情。尤其耽心的是：自己的地位和宗派，可能因为院系调整而受到损失。因此就产生了对院系调整的抗拒心理，并且造出了若干理由作为否定这一个正确政策的方略，企图达到个人不可告人的目的。
    我当时曾经提出：国家迫切地需要着经济建设人材。学校是造就人材的场所，多一个学校，就多一个造就人材的地方；并且强调各校各有其发展的历史和传统，如果硬性地把它们合并在一起，不但要影响原学校的发展，还可能引起干部之间的不团结。又因当时北京大学工学院有迁校的可能，我觉得我在此盘踞多年，根深蒂固，一旦环境变迁，个人的地位就可能受到影响。同时其他地区的物质条件以及子女们就学的条件，都不如北京；并且人生地疏，在社会活动上也会很受限制。因此便提出：中国现有的高等学校在数量上是绝对不够的，远不能适应客观的需要，因此在分布上，不是沿海各地过密，而是内地各地过稀。设如我们的高等教育是还要发展的，就应当在内地多添新校而不应当把沿海各地的学校合并到内地去。这一系列的鬼话，没有一句不是从个人利益出发的。清华大学、北京大学、华北大学三校的农学院合并以后，因为教师间闹宗派、搞小圈子，不团结，我便利用这件事实作为藉口来证实院系合并的不当。这种自私自利的行为，是何等的卑鄙！
    在新民主主义教育制度之下，旧型的高等学校已不能“自由发展”；同时，几个新型的大学，建校舍，聘教师，添设备，蓬蓬勃勃地成长起来了，这更使我感觉到“英雄无用武之地”，非常苦闷。因此幻想自己所在的学校最好也能摇身一变而成为新型大学。而摇身一变的方法，只有合并调整是可能的。后来又听说几位航空系主任，因为反对调整，受到了系中教师们的严厉指责，感觉到对于调整或合并，已经不能再抗拒下去了。但是合并是和自己的宗派的想法不相容的。不过宗派中是可以分出大宗派、小宗派的。在万不得已的情况下，只有牺牲小宗派而争取维护大宗派。清华大学、北京大学的两个土木系，性质相同，师资的交流，非常频繁，而教师之间大多数不是同学便是朋友。所以两系合并起来，比较地合乎牺牲小宗派维护大宗派的理想。同时通过两系的合并，教师和设备，就可望压倒一切。因此在去年四月初中央人民政府教育部召开会议，讨论院系调整以前，我便和当时的清华大学土木系主任夏震寰先生商定了两系单独合并的初步提议。这个提议在两系联席座谈会上取得教师们的同意以后，便向中央人民政府教育部正式提出。我私下还向夏先生说：“只有我们先提出合并的方案，才能制止教育部其他可能的打算。”这就是说，我怕北京大学和清华大学的土木系不能合并，而是和另外的学校的土木系合并，以致妨害了我维护宗派的可耻的企图。
    北京大学、清华大学两校土木系单独合并的方案，获得了领导方面的欢迎。但是这一方案并没有付诸实施。这是因为当时中央人民政府教育部可能是限于预算，确有“合并是好的，但是不可能添盖校舍”的说法，既然不能添盖校舍，两个土木系的合并就不可能了。但是，事实上校舍的添盖与否，并不是阻碍合并的决定条件；据说，主要是因为两系的单独合并方案，颇引起宗派主义者的反对，以致中央教育部不能不以全面考虑为理由，保留了两个土木系单独合并的建议。通过这一幕丑剧，我们可能获得了些什么呢？我想第一是钱俊瑞副部长在北京大学马寅初校长就职时讲话中提出的北京大学、清华大学两校不考虑合并的保证。当下我想，设能如此，就不但可以维护大宗派而且可以维护小宗派。第二：即使合并，两系已有言在先，绝不会再和其他学校的土木系合并，那末，至少对于大宗派还是可以维护的。
    北京大学是中央人民政府教育部直接领导的大学，在全国高等学校中占着很高的地位，它的一举一动，都受着全国高等学校的注视。而我对于院系调整，竟以这样极不光明的抗拒态度去对待，无疑地是影响了全国的院系调整工作的。更严重的是我还企图阻挠另外一些学校的院系调整工作。例如同济大学原有迁大连之议。已经在大连看了校址。当同济大学夏坚白校长到北京时，我便告诉他说，领导方面对院系调整的指示，是要稳步前进。借此希图影响夏校长，使他对院系调整工作也加强抗拒。我又在一次会议上举出有些同济大学的名教授已经因不愿迁校而想离开同济大学的事实，想借此打击领导方面的勇气。全国院系调整，迟迟未能贯彻，是和我们这些宗派主义者的阻挠分不开的。
    那末，院系调整的延缓，给祖国带来了多大的危害呢？就只按北京大学、清华大学两校来说，假如两校的土木系提早在去年调整，按今年可能招生数来估计，在这一年中，至少可以多招四百土木方面的学生。这样的一个数字，就等于今年暑假全国土木系毕业生的百分之三十以上。又如每班按平均五十人计算，四百名新生，必需由八个土木系才能负担。这也就是说，因为清华大学、北京大学两个土木系的未能调整，已经在无形中使国家损失了六个土木系。
    我的严重的自私自利的个人主义和宗派主义的思想，就是这样地影响了人民教育事业的发展。我作为一个人民教师，在思想上还存在着这样腐朽的资产阶级思想污毒，因而造成这样无可饶恕的罪过。幸而毛主席发动了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，拯救了我，使我彻底地清醒过来，认识了自己的丑恶。更联想到抗美援朝的志愿军，是在怎样的艰苦条件之下，为祖国，为国际正义坚苦奋斗，而我却躲在象牙塔里，干着自私自利、危害祖国的勾当。我辱没了“人民教师”的光荣称号！我觉得我的唯一出路，是下决心彻底清算我的严重的资产阶级腐朽思想，痛改前非，才能重回到人民队伍中来，在毛主席和共产党的英明领导之下，努力前进。
