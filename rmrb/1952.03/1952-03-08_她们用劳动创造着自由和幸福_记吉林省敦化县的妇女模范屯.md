    They Use Labor to Create Freedom and Happiness
    ——A Record of the Women's Model Village in Dunhua County, Jilin Province
    Dai Yue

    A few days before the "March 8th" International Women's Day, I visited the famous women's model village in Northeast China—Chengjihao Village, Democratic Village, Dunhua County, Jilin Province.
    Everywhere was a scene of preparing for spring plowing. Twelve li away from Chengjihao Village, in Guandi Village, I unexpectedly met eight young women, including Communist Youth League members Guan Xiuzhen and Jin Jingfang, from Chengjihao Village, who were picking up manure. The young League members eagerly told me about their progress in completing the spring plowing plan. All fifty-one women in the village had selected twenty-eight shi of soybean seeds, and had also collected 100,400 jin of manure. They had accumulated 10,200 jin of small ash, and 3,700 jin of chicken manure.
    Currently, forty-three women in Chengjihao Village are participating in year-round labor, and almost all women who can participate in year-round labor have joined. In their labor, they have demonstrated the great power of women. Last year, the forty-three women in the village completed a total of 5,007 workdays and opened up 24.3 hectares of wasteland, increasing income by 227 million yuan. The Jilin Province Second-Class Model Mutual Aid Team, Zhao Yulan Group, improved the soil last year, increasing the yield from 800 jin of millet per hectare to 3,400 jin. The highest yield reached 5,560 jin per hectare. Due to the achievements in agricultural production, in addition to Zhao Yulan being selected as a model, three other women were elected as county labor models, one of whom is a League member. Among the Communist Youth League members, one was elected as a county model cadre, and one was elected as a provincial model cadre.
    Women and men have used their labor to earn a happy life. Seventy percent of the families in the village are now living the life of new middle peasants. The seventy-five households in the village have more than eighty livestock, eighteen carts, and every family has a flock of chickens and two or three pigs. Every household has surplus grain, and they can eat well every three to five days. The women each have two or three new sets of clothes. In terms of cultural life, there is also a new atmosphere. In 1950, a farmers' spare-time school was established in the village, and thirty-six young women participated in learning. The old ladies also organized a newspaper reading group. Young women are also working hard to learn how to use new farm tools. Currently, two people have learned how to use the "Comprehensive Type" shovel cultivator. Woman Tang Yachen recalled her past life in the puppet Manchukuo, when she had not worn cotton clothes for seven winters, and excitedly said, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao, how could we have such good days today!"
    After Chairman Mao issued the call for increasing production and practicing economy, the women in the village quickly responded to this great call, and are determined to increase production and save 1,227.5 shi of grain this year.

    她们用劳动创造着自由和幸福
    ——记吉林省敦化县的妇女模范屯
    戴月
    在“三八”国际妇女节的前几天，我访问了东北著名的妇女模范屯——吉林省敦化县民主村成记号屯。
    到处都是一片准备春耕的景象。在离成记号屯十二里的官地村，我意外地遇见了成记号屯的青年团员关秀珍和金景芳等八个青年妇女，她们正在这里拣粪。青年团员们争着告诉我关于她们完成备耕计划的情况。全屯五十一名妇女已选定了二十八石豆籽，另外还拣了十万零四千斤粪，小灰已积了一万零二百斤，鸡粪有三千七百斤。
    现在成记号屯已有四十三个妇女参加长年劳动，凡是能参加长年劳动的妇女几乎都参加了。在劳动中，她们显示了妇女们的伟大力量。去年全村四十三个妇女共做了五千零七个工，并开了二十四垧又三亩荒地，增加收入二亿二千七百万元。吉林省二等模范互助组赵玉兰小组，去年改良了土壤，由过去每垧地打八百斤谷子增加到三千四百斤。最高的产量每垧达到五千五百六十斤。由于农业生产有成绩，除赵玉兰被选做模范外，还有三个妇女当选县劳动模范，其中有一个是团员。青年团员中还有一个当选了县模范干部，一个当选了省模范干部。
    妇女和男子们用自己的劳动换得了幸福的生活，全屯已经有百分之七十的人家过着新中农的生活。全屯七十五户就有八十多头牲口、十八辆大车，每家都有一群鸡，两三口猪，家家户户都有余粮，隔三、五天还能吃一顿好的。妇女们每人还有两三套新衣服。在文化生活上，也有了新的气象，一九五○年屯里成立了农民业余学校，三十六个青年妇女参加了学习。老太太们也组织了读报组。青年妇女们并努力学习使用新农具，现在已有两个人学会使用“综合号”铲趟机。妇女唐雅臣回忆起过去在伪满时候七个冬天没有穿过棉衣服的牛马生活，激动地说：“要不是毛主席，那有今天的好日子啊！”
    毛主席发出增产节约的号召后，全屯妇女很快就响应了这一伟大号召，要在今年增产节约一千二百二十七石五斗粮食。    （原载三月七日中国青年报）
