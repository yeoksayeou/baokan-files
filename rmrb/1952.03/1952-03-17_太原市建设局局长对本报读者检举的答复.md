Response to Criticism and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

    To the Editor: The People's Daily published reader Li Fan's letter on February 6th, accusing me of significant corruption, which helped me to examine my own mistakes.

    The reader revealed that I accepted bribes from the Linmao Toothpaste Company, accepted gifts from the manager of the water company, and failed to distinguish between public and private interests. These are all facts. The main reason this happened is that after entering the city, I could not resist the corruption of the bourgeoisie and developed a desire for enjoyment. I operated the Xinsheng Construction Company with the purely profit-seeking viewpoint of the bourgeoisie. This capitalist mode of operation led to repeated instances of cutting corners, benefiting small public entities at the expense of larger ones, and other errors in the contracting of projects by the Xinsheng Construction Company. My bureaucracy was also very serious. I was originally an amateur in engineering technology, but I was unwilling to study diligently and became self-righteous, which caused great losses to state property. For example, there were many corrupt individuals in our bureau and the Xinsheng Construction Company, and the waste in the Xinsheng Construction Company and municipal construction was even greater. I have made a preliminary self-criticism of this ideology and behavior at a cadre meeting in my bureau and am prepared to conduct a more profound examination and reflection. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of comrades, I am determined to completely eliminate my bourgeois ideology and request that the Party and administrative leadership departments give me the punishment I deserve.

    The following points made by reader Li Fan do not conform to the facts:

    (1) The person in charge of Xinsheng Construction Company is Comrade Jia Benzong. Cao Jimin (a corrupt element who has now fled) was the company's supervisor, and I have never accepted bribes from him. Regarding the matter of "the Municipal Party Committee sending people to investigate the concealment of funds by Xinsheng Company," Xinsheng Company's funds have never been concealed from higher authorities, because it is not a departmental production unit, but a municipal enterprise, and it is impossible to conceal them.

    (2) When Xinsheng Construction Company was established, an annual bonus system was stipulated. Bonuses were issued at the end of 1950 and when the company closed last August, in accordance with the regulations. After repeated study, we believe that this is not in the nature of "collective embezzlement." The statement that "every meal must have chicken, duck, fish, and meat, and one cannot swallow without wine" is also not the actual situation.

### 太原市建设局局长对本报读者检举的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    太原市建设局局长对本报读者检举的答复
    编辑同志：人民日报二月六日刊载了读者李藩的来信，检举我有重大贪污行为，帮助我检查了自己的错误。
    读者揭发我受林茂牙馆贿赂、接受自来水公司经理送礼、公私不分，这都是事实。所以发生这种情况，主要是我在进城后经不起资产阶级的腐蚀，有了贪图享受的思想。我以资产阶级的单纯营利观点经营新生建筑公司，这种资本主义的经营方式，使新生建筑公司在承包工程上一再发生偷工减料、损大公肥小公等错误。我的官僚主义也是很严重的。我对工程技术本来是外行，但又不肯细心钻研，自以为是，遂使国家财产遭受很大损失。如我局和新生建筑公司的贪污人数很多，而新生建筑公司和市政建设则浪费更大。我已把这种思想行为，初步在我局干部大会上作了检讨，并准备再作深刻的检查与反省。在党的领导和同志的帮助下，我决心彻底清除我的资产阶级思想，并要求党和行政领导部门给我以应得的处分。
    关于读者李藩所说与事实不符之处如下：
    （一）新生建筑公司负责人是贾本忠同志。曹济民（贪污分子，现已逃跑）是公司的监工员，我从未受过他的贿。所提“市委派人调查新生公司有隐瞒资金一部”的事，新生公司的资金没有对上级隐瞒过，因为它不是机关生产，是市的企业，无法隐瞒。
    （二）新生建筑公司在成立时曾规定了年终奖励制度。一九五○年年终和去年八月公司结束时，按规定发过奖励金。我们再三研究，这不是“集体分赃”性质。所提“每餐必有鸡鸭鱼肉，无酒不能下咽”，也并非实际情况。
    太原市建设局局长　李文杰
