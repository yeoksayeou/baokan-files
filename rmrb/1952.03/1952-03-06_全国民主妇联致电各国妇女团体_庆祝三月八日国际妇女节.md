Dear Mrs. Popova:

I extend warm congratulations to you and all Soviet sisters on "March 8th" International Women's Day.

The spirit of the Soviet people and women actively building a communist society and resolutely defending world peace greatly inspires us! We Chinese women are working with the people of the whole country to build our great motherland, resist America and aid Korea, and defend world peace.

We firmly believe that the close friendship between the people and women of China and the Soviet Union will be increasingly consolidated and developed, and we wish you good health!

I wish the people of China and Korea closer unity, redoubled efforts, and struggle to win the final victory over our common mortal enemy—the American aggressors.

Dear Mrs. Le Thi Xuyen:

On the occasion of "March 8th" International Women's Day, I and all Chinese women extend warm congratulations to you and our dear Vietnamese sisters.

Under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people and women have achieved significant victories in the anti-imperialist struggle. We firmly believe that Vietnamese sisters will make even greater efforts to fight resolutely for the national liberation of Vietnam and to defend peace in Asia and the world, and we wish you greater victories.

Telegram to the Japan Democratic Women's Association
To all members of the Japan Democratic Women's Association:

"March 8th" International Women's Day is approaching, and we Chinese women extend our warm friendship, congratulations, and respect to you.

Since the Second World War, you have lived an unprecedentedly tragic life under the long-term control of the American occupation authorities. American imperialists have deprived you of your freedom and independence, and deprived you of your basic human rights. Workers are subjected to brutal exploitation, receiving meager wages that are insufficient to maintain life, and farmers are overwhelmed by forced conscription and heavy taxes. The plight of women is even more difficult and well-known.

For six years, the attacks of American imperialism on the Japanese people have intensified. The signing of the so-called "San Francisco Peace Treaty" and the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" have accelerated Japan's path to colonialism and war, plunging the Japanese people into an even more miserable situation.

The Chinese people and women have long suffered from imperialist oppression and persecution, so we have boundless and deep sympathy for the Japanese people in distress, especially the Japanese women and children. The vigorous national democratic liberation movement that has developed among the Japanese people has received strong sympathy and support from the Chinese people and all peace-loving and democratic people in the world. With the unity and efforts of the people of the whole country and the support of peace-loving people all over the world, you will surely defeat the conspiracy and rule of American imperialism and achieve final victory.

In order to prevent your husbands and sons from being used as cannon fodder by American imperialism, and in order for you to live a life of warmth and abundance, we believe that Japanese women and mothers will more actively work with their husbands and sons for the great struggle for the independence and liberation of their motherland.

I wish the ranks of struggling Japanese women to grow stronger, and I wish you success in your struggle for Japan's independence, freedom, peace, and democracy.

Telegram to Indian Women
To the All India Women's Conference, transferred to all Indian Sisters:

On the occasion of "March 8th" International Women's Day, we Chinese women extend warm friendship and congratulations to our dear Indian sisters.

The two great nations of China and India are not only bordering each other, but also have a deep and long-standing friendship. We both have a long and splendid national culture, and we have both long suffered from the brutal exploitation and enslavement of imperialism and feudal forces. Therefore, the people of our two countries love peace and oppose aggression. In the future, the friendship and cultural ties between the people and women of our two countries will be further developed and consolidated.

When reviewing the ranks and strength of our women on "March 8th" International Women's Day, we are excited to see that women and mothers of different nationalities, different skin colors, and different political and religious beliefs who love peace have united under the common goal of defending peace and protecting the rights of women and children. Our ranks have grown unprecedentedly, becoming a huge force in the world's increasingly high tide of peace movement.

We hope that in the coming year, the friendship between the women of our two countries will develop day by day, and we will unite closely to fight together to defend peace in Asia and the world.

I sincerely wish you good health. With warm regards,
蔡畅 [Cai Chang]

    给日本民主妇女协议会的贺电日本民主妇女协议会全体会员们：
    “三八”国际妇女节快要来到了，我们中国妇女特向你们致热烈的友谊祝贺与敬意。
    第二次世界大战以后，你们在美国占领当局长期控制下，过着空前未有悲惨的日子。美帝国主义者剥夺了你们的自由和独立，剥夺了你们的基本人权；工人们受着残酷的剥削，领着不足以维持生活的低微工资，农民们被强征和苛税压得喘不过气来，而妇女们处境的更加困难是人所共知的事。
    六年来，美帝国主义对日本人民的进攻日益变本加厉，所谓“旧金山和约”、“美日安全条约”的签订，使日本加速地走上了殖民地和战争的道路，使日本人民陷入更加悲惨的境地。
    中国人民和妇女曾经长期受过帝国主义的蹂躏与迫害，因此对于苦难中的日本人民，特别是日本的妇女与儿童，抱着无限深切的同情。日本人民已经发展起来的蓬勃的民族民主解放运动，受到了中国人民和全世界爱好和平与民主的人们的强有力的同情与支援。你们在全国人民团结和努力，全世界爱好和平人民的支援下，必能打败美帝国主义的阴谋与统治，取得最后胜利。
    为了不使自己的丈夫、儿子给美帝国主义作炮灰，为了你们可以过着温饱的生活，我们相信日本的妇女和母亲一定会更积极地和丈夫、儿子一起为祖国独立与解放的伟大斗争而努力。
    祝斗争中的日本妇女的队伍日益壮大，祝你们争取日本的独立、自由、和平、民主的斗争获得成功。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会
    给印度妇女的贺电全印妇女大会转印度全体姊妹们：
    欣逢“三八”国际妇女节，我们中国妇女谨向亲爱的印度姊妹们致热烈的友谊祝贺。
    中印两大民族不但边境接壤而且有着深厚悠久的友谊，我们都具有悠久的灿烂的民族文化，也都曾长期受过帝国主义和封建势力的残酷剥削与奴役。因此我们两国人民都是酷爱和平，反对侵略。今后我们两国人民与妇女的友谊与文化联系将更加发展与巩固。
    在“三八”国际妇女节检阅我们妇女的队伍与力量时，我们兴奋地看到在保卫和平、保卫妇女与儿童权益的共同目标下，各不同民族、不同肤色、不同政治与宗教信仰的爱好和平的妇女与母亲已经团结起来。我们的队伍空前壮大了，成为全世界日益高涨的和平运动的一支巨大力量。
    我们希望在未来的一年中，我们两国妇女的友谊日益发展，我们将紧密团结起来，为保卫亚洲与世界和平而共同奋斗。
    衷心祝你们健康。此致热烈的敬礼
    蔡畅
