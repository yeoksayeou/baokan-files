    The First Engineering Division of the Sichuan River Engineering Company
    Should Correct its Irresponsible Attitude Towards Projects

    Editor: He Xiaofeng, head of the First Engineering Division of the Eastern Sichuan River Engineering Company, has adopted an irresponsible attitude towards the basic construction project of Factory 103 undertaken by his division. Last November, the Xinhua Daily criticized the division for cutting corners on the construction of the reflux pool project for the electrolysis workshop, but He Xiaofeng did not correct the mistake in the slightest. In late February, when the division poured the cement footing for the reverberatory furnace chimney, the stones used were not clean and contained mud, sand, and weeds, and the size was not up to standard. The main beam project of the electrolysis workshop was completed at the end of January. However, in less than a month, one of the main beams was found to be bending downwards. The Factory 103 inspection team notified the division in writing to request modification, but the division did not respond.

    All the beam frame screws designed by the division for the boiler room, engine room, electrolysis workshop, and motor room, five hundred in total that were six-tenths of an inch thick, exceeded the required length, and could not be tightened. The First Engineering Division of the Sichuan River Engineering Company should be responsible for handling these problems.

    川江工程公司第一工程处
    应纠正对工程不负责的态度
    编辑同志：川东川江工程公司第一工程处主任何啸风，以不负责任的态度对待所承建的一○三厂基本建设工程。去年十一月，因该处在修建电解房回水池工程上偷工减料，新华日报曾提出批评，但何啸风丝毫没有纠正错误。二月下旬，该处浇反射炉烟囱的洋灰地脚时，所用的石子不干净，还夹有泥砂杂草，尺寸也不合规格。电解房大梁工程在一月底全部完成。但不到一月，已发现其中一根大梁向下弯曲了。一○三厂检查小组以书面通知该处要求修改，但该处竟不予答复。
    该处经手设计的锅炉房、引擎房、电解房及电机房的全部梁架螺钉，六分粗的有五百根，每根均超过需要长度，无法拉紧。川江工程公司第一工程处应负责处理这些问题。    汪洗遗
