Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th: The U.S. aggressors' heinous conspiracy to hand over captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan is now accelerating according to its predetermined plan. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Taipei on March 3rd: "According to semi-official Kuomintang sources: Forty-five communist prisoners of war in the Pusan prisoner-of-war camp have written letters in blood requesting to come to Taipei to participate in the government's anti-communist struggle." "The government has expressed its welcome to communist Chinese prisoners of war in Korea who volunteer to participate in the anti-communist cause." On March 14th, a reporter from the Chiang bandit Central News Agency "learned from reliable sources" on Geoje Island that 80 percent of the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army imprisoned on Geoje Island have been forced to tattoo characters on their arms and write letters in blood, "and express to the relevant authorities their determination to return to the banner of the free China led by President Chiang"; "Their greatest concern is whether they will be able to join the ranks of the Taiwan National Army in the future." Combining these circumstances with the news openly clamored by personnel of the puppet embassy stationed in South Korea on January 15th that "once things are ready, the vast majority of communist Chinese prisoners of war will be willing to return to Kuomintang China," it can be seen that after a long series of heinous activities by Chiang bandit special agents (i.e., the so-called Chiang bandit "instructors" in the U.S. military prisoner-of-war camps) and the American brigands in the U.S. military prisoner-of-war camps, creating some "conditions," the U.S. aggressors have not only begun to transport captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Taiwan; and the number of people planned to be transported accounts for a large proportion of all captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In the implementation of this heinous conspiracy, the reporter from the Chiang bandit Central News Agency is spreading rumors and creating public opinion, and the personnel of the Chiang bandit puppet embassy and those Chiang bandit special agents sent to the American prisoner-of-war camps to serve as "instructors" are the actual executors of this heinous plan under the instructions of the U.S. military authorities. One of the purposes of the U.S. representatives in the fourth item on the agenda of the Korean armistice negotiations is to delay the negotiations in order to cooperate internally and externally to realize this heinous conspiracy. This sinful act of the U.S. aggressors, disregarding international law and actively implementing this conspiracy, has aroused the intolerable anger of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world. If the U.S. aggressors do not immediately stop this sinful activity, they must bear all the consequences of this event.

    美侵略者勾结蒋匪特务加紧罪恶活动
    竟开始将我志愿军被俘人员送往台湾
    【新华社开城十七日电】美国侵略者企图将我志愿军被俘人员送交台湾蒋介石匪帮的罪恶阴谋活动，现正按照其预定计划加速进行中。据美联社台北三月三日电称：“据国民党半官方消息：釜山战俘营内，中共战俘四十五人，血书诉请来台北，参加国府之反共斗争”。“国府方面已表示欢迎在韩中共战俘志愿参加抗共”。三月十四日蒋匪中央社记者自巨济岛“可靠方面获悉”：被囚禁在巨济岛上的我志愿军被俘人员有百分之八十已被强迫在臂上刺字、写血书，“并向有关当局表示回到蒋总统领导的自由中国的旗帜下的决心”；“他们所最关切的事是他们将来是否能够参加台湾国军的队伍。”把这些情况和一月十五日驻南朝鲜的伪使馆人员所公开叫嚣的“一俟事情准备停当，绝大部分共产党中国战俘都愿意回到国民党中国境内”的消息结合起来，便可看出经过蒋匪特务分子（即美军俘虏营中的所谓蒋匪“教官”）与美军俘虏营中的美国强盗们经过长期的一系列的罪恶活动，制造了若干“条件”之后，美国侵略者不仅已开始将我志愿军被俘人员向台湾运送；并且计划运送的人数当占我志愿军全部被俘人员的很大比例。在这个罪恶阴谋的实施中，蒋匪中央社的记者是在散放空气，制造舆论，蒋匪伪使馆人员和那批被派到美国俘虏营中充任“教官”的蒋匪特务分子则是这个罪恶计划在美军当局指示之下的实际执行者。而美方在朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程讨论中的谈判代表拖延谈判的目的之一，也正是为了要里应外合，实现这一罪恶阴谋。美国侵略者这种不顾国际公法、积极执行这个阴谋计划的罪恶行为，已引起中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的无法容忍的愤怒，美国侵略者如不立即停止这一罪恶活动，它就必须承担这一事件的全部后果。
