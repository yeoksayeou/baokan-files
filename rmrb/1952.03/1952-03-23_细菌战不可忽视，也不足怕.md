Germ Warfare Cannot Be Ignored, Nor Is It To Be Feared
Xie Juezai

Germ warfare, a term not very familiar to people, may cause some people's minds to fluctuate between neglect and fear.

Can germ warfare be ignored? No. A group of poisonous things invisible to the naked eye, once they enter the body of a person or animal, can take your life when they break out. Letting it spread can cause massive deaths. Is germ warfare scary? Not scary. The question is how to make effective precautions.

The characteristic of bacteria is that they are "small" and do not attract attention. They are transmitted into the blood of humans or animals through the mouths of fleas and lice, and enter the body of humans or animals from the air and drinking water; precisely because they are small, they are weak and short-lived, and must rely on insects, rats, garbage, etc. and suitable climate to survive, reproduce, and do evil.

As long as we pay attention to hygiene, such as eliminating rats, lice, and flies, removing garbage, cleaning drinking water, and not eating raw or cold food, that is "sweeping the lairs" of bacteria; and "clearing the fields" on the path of bacterial attack. The second is to get vaccinations. If you accidentally encounter a few small enemies, they will be immediately eliminated in the body. These things should be done even without germ warfare, and should be intensified when there is germ warfare. Every family should take precautions, and everyone should be prepared for war. This can not only defend against bacteria dropped by the enemy, but also reduce common diseases and make people healthier.

Germ warfare is the most shameless act of American imperialism, which has lost all conscience and dares to violate international conventions and humanitariansim; but it is also a boring and low-energy struggle after the military and political failures of American imperialism. A reporter from the British Workers' Daily said: "Acheson's attempt to get the International Committee of the Red Cross into North Korea is a fraudulent act, the purpose of which is to obtain a report on the effectiveness of germ warfare." It can be seen that the war-mongers who are enemies of mankind also have very little grasp of germ warfare.

Germ warfare is a blackmail, more abominable than atomic bomb blackmail, and its failure will be even more shameful.

But our people must pay serious attention: strengthen the epidemic prevention organization, spread epidemic prevention knowledge, and implement epidemic prevention discipline. We must ensure that American imperialism gains nothing; and what we gain is medical progress, hygiene progress, and a deepening of our hatred for imperialism, increasing the speed of various construction tasks, and burying the ferocious enemy of mankind as soon as possible.

### 细菌战不可忽视，也不足怕

    细菌战不可忽视，也不足怕
    谢觉哉
    细菌战，这一不大为人们所熟悉的名词，可能引起一些人心理上的忽视或者恐惧的波动。
    细菌战可以忽视吗？不可以。一群肉眼看不见的毒东西，一钻进人或动物的体内，发作起来，能夺去你的生命。任它传染，能造成大量的死亡。细菌战可怕吗？不可怕。问题在于如何作有效的防范。
    细菌的特点在于“细”，不惹人注意。经跳蚤、虱子的嘴传进人或动物的血中，从空气和食物饮水里钻进人或动物的体内；也正因为细，力小命短，须倚靠昆虫、老鼠、垃圾等和适当的气候，才能生存、繁殖，才能作恶。
    只要我们注意卫生，比如灭鼠、灭虱、灭蝇、清除垃圾、清洁饮水、不食生冷，那就是对细菌藏身之地“犁庭扫穴”；对细菌进攻之路“坚壁清野”。其次是打预防针。偶然碰上几个小敌人，马上被消灭在体内。这些，没有细菌战时应该做，在有细菌战时更要加紧做，家家预防，人人应战，不只可防御敌人投下的细菌，且能减少一般疾病，使人民身体更加健康。
    细菌战，是美帝国主义丧尽天良，敢于违反国际公约，违反人道的最无耻的行为；但也是美帝国主义军事失败，政治失败后一种无聊的低能的挣扎。英国工人日报记者说：“艾奇逊想使红十字国际委员会进入北朝鲜，是一种欺诈行为，目的是要得到关于细菌战的效力如何的报告”，可见以人类为敌的战争贩子们，对细菌战的把握也是很少的。
    细菌战是个讹诈，比原子弹讹诈更可恶，而其失败也必更可耻。
    但我们人民必须严重注意：加强防疫组织，传播防疫常识，实行防疫纪律。要使美帝国主义一无所得；而我们得到的是医药进步、卫生进步，而且更加深对帝国主义的仇恨，提高各种建设工作的速度，从速把人类的凶恶的敌人埋葬掉。
