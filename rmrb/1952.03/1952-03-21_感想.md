    Thoughts
    Stalin Prize Winner
    Zhou Libo
    I am extremely excited and honored to have received the Stalin Prize again.
    The real life of our people is incomparably rich. Under the correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, the heroic people have experienced countless earth-shattering struggles. As an ordinary soldier engaged in literature and art, under the influence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, I have reflected a small corner of this rich reality. The glory I have received should be attributed to the great fighting people, and to the Chinese Communist Party and our leader Chairman Mao, who lead the people from victory to victory.
    Stalin's sunshine shines on the West and on the East. The great Soviet people, nurtured by Stalin, have given us cordial care and selfless help in the past and present, at all times. I love the heroic motherland, and I also love the heroic Soviet Union. As I receive the Stalin Prize again, I express not only my personal gratitude, but also my blessings to the Soviet Union, wishing her national strength and culture grow stronger and more prosperous day by day.

    感想
    斯大林奖金获得者
    周立波
    我又得到了以伟大的斯大林的名字命名的奖金，衷心感到非常兴奋和荣幸。
    我国人民的现实生活是无比丰富的，英雄的人民在伟大的中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东同志的正确的领导之下，经历了无数翻天覆地的斗争。我以一个从事文艺的普通的战士，在马列主义—毛泽东思想的薰陶之下，反映了这丰富的现实的一个小角落，其所得到的光荣是要归之于伟大的战斗着的人民，以及领导人民从胜利走向胜利的中国共产党和我们的领袖毛主席的。
    斯大林的阳光照耀着西方，也照耀着东方。斯大林教养的伟大的苏联人民，过去和现在，时时刻刻都给我们以亲切的关怀和无私的帮助。我热爱英雄的祖国，也热爱英雄的苏联。在我再度获得斯大林奖金的时候，我怀着不只是属于我个人的感谢之情，向苏联祝福，祝福她的国力和文化一天一天的强盛和繁昌。
