Criticism of Bai Ren's "Fighting Until Tomorrow" Helps Readers Correct Erroneous Thinking - Summary of Readers' Letters

Following the publication of the "Cultural Life Brief Review" criticizing Bai Ren's novel "Fighting Until Tomorrow" in this newspaper on December 2nd of last year, and Comrade Yuan Shuipai's article criticizing the same novel on February 17th, we have successively received letters from over twenty readers. The majority of them were written by military cadres. They unanimously agreed with the newspaper's criticism and hoped that Comrade Bai Ren would conduct a profound self-criticism.

Military reader Ma Bin said that he used to mistakenly believe that this was a "valuable" work, "During discussions and large lectures, I kept reading 'Fighting Until Tomorrow'..." He suggested that Comrade Bai Ren make a public self-criticism.

Kong Yulong and Jiang Zifang of the Xiaogan County People's Government in Hubei Province said that they used to like this novel and searched for its sequels in bookstores several times. Now they realize that it is poisonous. They recognized that it is a novel with serious errors in propagating petty-bourgeois ideology.

Two military readers, Wen Yongzhi and Huang Liangjing, said that they felt very ashamed and indignant after reading the criticism. They said, "We are newly enlisted intellectuals who have received a relatively short period of education in the revolutionary ranks, and still have remnants of petty-bourgeois ideology. Therefore, when we read the book 'Fighting Until Tomorrow', we found it 'very interesting'. We even 'promoted' it. The People's Daily's criticism is completely correct and has greatly enlightened and helped us, making us realize our past mistakes."

Huang Bai of the Political Department of the Huanggang Military Subdistrict of the Hubei Military Region said that "Fighting Until Tomorrow" was popular in their unit. "Especially the new cadres who came from intellectual backgrounds were eager to read it." For example, in the subdistrict propaganda team of seventy people, sixty-five had read the novel, and some had read it repeatedly three or four times, all mistakenly believing that it was a good book. It was not until they read the newspaper's criticism that many comrades "were shocked" and "suddenly realized." He said, "From this, it can be seen how much we need critical articles to help and guide our reading!"

Li Keya of the North China Military and Political Cadre School hoped that the Political Department of the Central and South Military Region would examine its publishing work in light of Bai Ren's erroneous works.

In addition to the above readers, Liu Minwu of the Henan Infantry School, Wang Zengyi of the Yuanzhou Military Subdistrict Political Department of Jiangxi, Feng Ge of the Hubei Military Region Political Department, Chen Xu of the Hubei Military Region Military and Political Cadre School Political Department, Wang Mengchao of the North China Artillery Headquarters, Zhang Xuedong of Tangshan, Su Tao of Shanxi, Xu Dayu of Fu Jen Catholic University, Yu Nan of Beijing, and other readers expressed similar opinions. Some readers suggested that those in the military who had previously read Bai Ren's works should relate to their own thinking and study these criticisms.

    对白刃“战斗到明天”的批评帮助读者纠正了错误思想
    ——读者来信综述
    本报在去年十二月二日发表了批评白刃小说“战斗到明天”的“文化生活简评”和二月十七日发表了袁水拍同志批评同一小说的文章后，已陆续收到二十多位读者的来信。其中大部分是部队干部写的。他们对报纸的批评一致表示同意，并希望白刃同志进行深刻的检讨。
    部队读者马斌说，他过去曾误认为这是一本“有价值”的作品，“在讨论会中，听大课时，还念念不忘地看‘战斗到明天’……”，他建议白刃同志作公开检讨。
    湖北省孝感县人民政府孔羽龙、蒋子芳说，他们过去曾喜欢过这部小说，好几次到书店去找寻这部书的续集，现在才认识它是有毒素的。他们认识到这是一本有严重错误的宣传小资产阶级思想的小说。
    两位部队读者文永志、黄良经说，他们读了批评以后，感到十分羞愤。他们说，“我们是新参军的知识分子，在革命队伍里受教育的时间较短，还有小资产阶级思想残余，所以我们读‘战斗到明天’这本书时，是感到‘津津有味’的。我们还为它‘宣传’过。人民日报的批评是完全正确的，对我们有很大的启发和帮助，使我们认识了我们过去的错误。”
    湖北军区黄冈军分区政治部黄白说，“战斗到明天”在他们部队里曾受欢迎。“特别是一般知识分子出身的新干部，更是抢着阅读。”像分区宣传队七十人，就有六十五人看过这本小说，有的还反复看了三、四遍，都错误地认为这是本好书。直到看了报纸的批评后，很多同志“才大吃一惊”、“恍然大悟”。他说，“从这里可以说明，我们是如何的需要批评文章来帮助和指导我们的阅读啊！”
    华北军政干部学校李克亚希望中南军区政治部就白刃的错误作品，对自己的出版工作进行检查。
    除以上的一些读者外，还有河南步兵学校刘敏吾、江西袁州军分区政治部王曾益、湖北军区政治部凤阁、湖北军区军政干部学校政治部陈旭、华北炮兵司令部王梦潮、唐山张学洞、山西速涛、辅仁大学徐大愚、北京毓南等读者表示了相类似的意见，有的读者建议部队中过去读过白刃的这几本作品的人，联系自己的思想，对这些批评进行研究。
