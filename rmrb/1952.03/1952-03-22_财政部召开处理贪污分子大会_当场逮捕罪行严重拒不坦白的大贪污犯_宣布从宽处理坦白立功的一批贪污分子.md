    The Ministry of Finance's Committee for Thrift Examination of the Central People's Government convened a meeting of all staff on March 15 to deal with embezzlers.  The judicial authorities arrested major embezzlers who had conclusive evidence against them but refused to confess on the spot. At the same time, lenient treatment was announced for embezzlers who thoroughly confessed and performed meritorious service to atone for their crimes. Liang Zhuhang, Director of the General Bureau of Grain Management of the Ministry of Finance, first accused Qiao Jingfeng, a major embezzler who refused to confess, at the meeting. Qiao was an accountant at the grain processing plant under the Bureau. Since joining the work in early 1950, he had consistently engaged in embezzlement. In April 1950, he and two other cadres were sent to Shijiazhuang and other places to purchase wheat. Under his instigation and planning, they collectively embezzled by buying cheap and reporting high, reporting after buying, reselling wheat, and using public funds for business, embezzling a total of more than 140 million yuan, of which Qiao embezzled more than 70 million yuan. During the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, Qiao repeatedly colluded with accomplices to form an "offensive and defensive alliance." During study sessions, he falsely claimed to be deaf, downplaying his crimes and attempting to evade mass exposure. After the masses presented conclusive evidence of his crimes, he stubbornly resisted. Wu Bo, chairman of the meeting, announced that major embezzlers like Qiao Jingfeng, who dared to resist the movement, could be severely punished based on the conclusive evidence already investigated. Representatives of the Beijing Municipal People's Court immediately announced the arrest of Qiao at the meeting and would punish him according to law.
    At the meeting, major embezzlers who confessed their crimes included Deng Zhixi, Wang Dian'an, and Wang Yinrong. They were all major embezzlers who had embezzled state assets worth more than 100 million yuan. Their crimes were also serious. For example, Deng Zhixi sold state tax information and colluded with unscrupulous merchants to evade state taxes, causing great losses to the state. However, because they confessed relatively thoroughly, exposed others, performed meritorious service, and actively returned stolen goods, the chairman of the meeting announced on the spot that he would report to the Central Thrift Examination Committee for lenient treatment. In addition, representatives of the Municipal People's Court also announced that Tang Jianbing, Kong Gang, Wu Guoliang, Sun Ruihu, Meng Zhaotai, and five other embezzlers who had embezzled more than 10 million yuan and confessed relatively thoroughly would be exempted from criminal punishment.
    The handling of the above-mentioned embezzlers at the meeting fully reflected the spirit of leniency for those who confess and severity for those who resist, and aroused a new upsurge of confession and exposure. The masses present at the meeting immediately exposed the crimes of Jin Shugang, Sun Jingyu, Li Guo, and other embezzlers who refused to confess, had not confessed, or had not confessed thoroughly. The masses demanded that they confess on the spot. The chairman of the meeting accepted the demands of the masses and announced a temporary adjournment, requiring these embezzlers to confess to the masses in small group meetings immediately. Most of these embezzlers initially confessed their problems in the small group meetings, but a few still refused to confess. The masses unanimously demanded that they be arrested and punished according to law immediately. In order to issue a serious warning to these embezzlers who resisted the movement, after the small group meetings, the general assembly continued. Zhang Yaping, director of the office of the Materials Management Bureau, accused Jin Shugang, the most stubborn major embezzler. Then, representatives of the Beijing Municipal People's Court announced his arrest and will severely punish him.
    Rong Zihe and Wang Shao'ao, Deputy Ministers of Finance, both spoke at the meeting, calling on embezzlers to thoroughly explain their problems in order to receive lenient treatment from the People's Government. Rong Zihe said: Facts have repeatedly shown that those who can thoroughly confess, sincerely repent, and return stolen goods can be given lenient punishment. Conversely, embezzlers who refuse to confess, like Qiao Jingfeng and Jin Shugang, can be convicted as long as the evidence is conclusive, even if they do not admit it themselves. It is absolutely impossible for embezzlers to attempt to muddle through; only thorough confession can lead to a way out.

    财政部召开处理贪污分子大会
    当场逮捕罪行严重拒不坦白的大贪污犯
    宣布从宽处理坦白立功的一批贪污分子
    【本报讯】中央人民政府财政部节约检查委员会在三月十五日召集全体工作人员举行处理贪污分子大会。当场由司法机关逮捕了证据确凿、拒不坦白的大贪污犯，同时宣布从宽处理彻底坦白、并能立功赎罪的贪污分子。财政部粮食管理总局局长梁竹航首先在会上控诉拒不坦白的大贪污犯乔景丰的罪行。乔犯是该局所属粮食加工厂的会计员，自一九五零年初参加工作以来，即一贯贪污。一九五零年四月他和另外两个干部被派往石家庄等地采购小麦，在他的主谋和策动之下，先后用贱买贵报、先买后报、捣卖小麦、以公款做生意等方法进行集体贪污，共贪污款一亿四千余万元，乔犯分得七千余万元。乔犯在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，几次找同案人订立“攻守同盟”，又在学习中诡称耳聋，避重就轻，企图逃避群众检举。经群众提出他的确凿罪证后，他仍然顽固抗拒。大会主席吴波宣布，对像乔景丰这样胆敢抗拒运动的大贪污犯，完全可以根据已经调查的确凿罪证，予以严惩。北京市人民法院代表当即在大会上宣布逮捕乔犯，依法惩办。
    在会上，坦白交代罪行的大贪污分子有邓智熙、王殿安、王荫荣等三人。他们都是贪污国家资财一亿以上的大贪污分子。他们的罪行也是严重的。如邓智熙，曾出卖国家税收情报，勾结奸商偷漏国税，使国家遭受很大损失；但由于他们坦白比较彻底，并能检举立功和积极退赃，大会主席当场宣布报请中央节约检查委员会从轻处理。此外，市人民法院代表并宣布对唐鉴冰、孔刚、吴国梁、孙瑞虎、孟兆泰等五个贪污在一千万元以上而坦白比较彻底的贪污分子，免予刑事处分。
    大会对上述贪污分子的处理，充分体现了坦白从宽、抗拒从严的精神，激起了新的坦白检举高潮。到会群众当场就检举了金树刚、孙经宇、李国等拒不坦白、尚未坦白或未彻底坦白的贪污分子的罪行。群众并要求他们当场坦白交代。大会主席接受群众要求，宣布暂时休会，要这些贪污分子立即在小组会上向群众交代。这些贪污分子多数在小组会上初步交代了自己的问题，但少数人仍然拒不交代，群众一致要求立即予以逮捕法办。为了向这些抗拒运动的贪污分子提出严重警告，在小组会结束后，继续开大会，物资管理总局办公室主任张亚平对其中最顽固的大贪污犯金树刚提出控诉后，即由北京市人民法院代表宣布予以逮捕，并将从严惩处。
    财政部副部长戎子和、王绍鏊都在大会上讲了话，号召贪污分子把问题彻底交代清楚，以便得到人民政府的宽大处理。戎子和说：事实已一再说明，凡能彻底坦白、真诚悔过、退出赃物者，均可从轻处分；反之，像乔景丰、金树刚这样的拒不坦白的贪污分子，只要证据确凿，即使自己不承认，同样可以判罪。贪污分子企图蒙混过关是绝对不可能的；只有彻底坦白，才有出路。
