(II) Expose the Treasonous Crimes of Illegal Capitalists Who Aid the Enemy

The large number of facts revealed in the anti-corruption, anti-bribery movement have already demonstrated that the bourgeoisie has launched an extremely rampant attack on the country in the past two or three years. They are employing various despicable means every day to steal national wealth on a large scale and pervasively. They even unscrupulously target the Chinese People's Volunteers, the heroic sons and daughters of the Chinese people, who are unanimously sympathized with and praised by peace-loving people around the world, secretly plotting and murdering for money, stealing tens of billions and hundreds of billions of yuan. Their heinous crimes have aroused strong indignation among the people of the whole country. But their criminal activities do not stop there. The movement has further revealed that, in order to pursue more exorbitant profits, they have even engaged in the shameful act of directly aiding American imperialism. In the first half of 1950, when American imperialism was actively launching the war of aggression against Korea, Li Guowei, the manager of the privately owned Shenxin Textile Factory in Wuhan, went so far as to use the wealth created by the motherland's workers to remit funds five times to New York to purchase the equivalent of 700 million yuan in American government bonds. Zeng Qitao, the manager of the Dechang Customs Brokerage in Guangzhou, smuggled a large amount of the strategically important material tin, which was forbidden for export, to American imperialism to supply their war of aggression against Korea and the slaughter of their own compatriots. Some capitalists secretly reported the inventory and pre-sale time of certain important export goods of our country to American imperialism, enabling American imperialism to prepare early, try to manipulate international market prices, and attack our motherland's export business and overall economic construction. In large coastal cities, especially in the import and export industries, there are many such situations. With the deepening of the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement, these criminal activities are being exposed in increasing numbers.

On the surface, some bourgeois figures (including Li Guowei) are very "patriotic." At large and small meetings, they can speak many patriotic principles, saying how much they hate imperialist bandits and compradors. They will express that they want to "serve the people wholeheartedly" and are determined to "strive for the independence, prosperity, strength, and industrialization of the motherland." In reality, they only have one thing in mind, and that is "money." In order to earn more "money," earn "money" quickly, and make their bellies fatter and bigger, they can undermine all policies, laws, and the Common Program, and they can also harm the People's Volunteers in secret, and even use money, materials, and intelligence to help American imperialism, and increase American imperialism's capital for invading their own motherland and people. They do not care at all how much disaster this behavior will bring to the motherland and the people. What they care about is: "This is a profitable thing."

American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and the mortal enemy of all peace-loving people in the world. The spearhead of American imperialism's aggression is not only directly aimed at Korea and our country, but also seriously threatens world peace. In order to defeat American imperialism's aggression, the people of our country have paid a huge price, even paying a large amount of blood and life. The fighting Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate such treasonous and enemy-aiding behavior of illegal capitalists! The patriotic people of the whole country must unite and relentlessly expose the treasonous and enemy-aiding and all harmful acts to the country and the people of illegal capitalists! Resolutely repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on the people and the motherland!

### （二）检举违法资本家的资敌罪行

    （二）检举违法资本家的资敌罪行
    反贪污、反行贿运动中揭发出来的大量事实，已经说明资产阶级两三年来向国家进行了极为猖狂的进攻。他们每天都在采取各种卑劣手段，大量地无孔不入地盗窃着国家的财富。甚至对中国人民的英雄子弟、全世界和平人民所一致同情和赞誉的中国人民志愿军，也不惜暗下毒手，谋财害命，成十亿，成百亿地进行盗窃。他们的滔天罪行，已经激起全国人民的强烈义愤。但是他们的犯罪活动不止于此。运动中进一步发现：他们为了追逐更多的暴利，甚至干出了直接资助美帝国主义的可耻勾当。一九五○年上半年，当美帝国主义积极发动侵朝战争的时候，武汉市私营申新纱厂经理李国伟竟丧心病狂地拿祖国工人们创造的财富，五次汇款到纽约购买了相当于人民币七亿元的美国公债。广州市德昌报关行经理曾其滔，则大量偷运禁止出口的战略物资——锡，卖给美帝国主义，供给美帝国主义进行侵朝战争，屠杀自己的同胞。有的资本家把我国某些重要出口物资的存量及预售时间密报给美帝国主义，使美帝国主义早做准备，设法操纵国际市场价格，打击我们祖国的出口事业和整个经济建设。在沿海的大城市中，尤其是进出口行业中，这种情形还有很多。随着反贪污、反行贿运动的深入开展，这种罪恶活动日益众多地被暴露了出来。
    从表面上看，某些资产阶级的人物（包括李国伟在内）是很“爱国”的。他们在大的小的会议上，可以讲出许多爱国的道理，会说他们如何痛恨帝国主义强盗和买办们。他们会表示自己要“全心全意为人民服务”，并决心“为祖国的独立富强和工业化而奋斗”。实际上，他们脑子里想的只有一种东西，那就是“钱”。为了多赚“钱”，快赚“钱”，把自己的肚皮吃得更肥，更大，他们可以破坏一切政策法令和共同纲领，也可以暗害人民志愿军，甚至也可以用金钱、物资和情报来帮助美帝国主义，给美帝国主义增加侵略自己祖国和人民的本钱。这种行为会给祖国和人民带来多少灾难，他们是完全不关心的。他们关心的只是：“这是有利可图的事情。”
    美帝国主义是我国人民的死敌，也是全世界爱好和平人民的死敌。美帝国主义的侵略矛头，不仅直接指向朝鲜和我国，而且也严重地威胁着世界和平。为着击退美帝国主义的侵略，我国人民曾经付出了巨大的牺牲，直至付出大量的鲜血和生命。对于不法资本家这种叛国资敌的行为，战斗着的中国人民绝对不能容忍！全国的爱国人民一致行动起来，无情地检举不法资本家叛国资敌及一切危害国家人民的罪恶行为！坚决击退资产阶级向人民向祖国的猖狂进攻！
