    Use Increased Per-Unit Area Yield to Strike at the American Aggressors
    National Model Agricultural Laborer Li Shunda
    When I saw in the newspaper the news that the American bandits, disregarding human justice and international law, were conducting germ warfare in Korea and our Northeast, Qingdao, and other places, I was filled with hatred. The farmers in our village all said, "This is not something humans do." Since the beginning of time, we have only known that people do not want to get sick, nor do they want others to get sick. We have never heard of anyone creating diseases. But these American beasts, still wearing human clothing, are deliberately creating diseases for people. We resolutely protest against this inhuman bestial behavior of the American bandits. We, the common people, fully support the solemn statements made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government on February 24th and around March 8th. We want to warn the American warmongers: We Chinese people love peace, but we will never allow others to trample on us. We Chinese people have been tempered in long-term warfare. We defeated the Japanese imperialists who implemented the "Three Alls" policy and annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by American imperialism. Our Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fought side by side and routed the American aggressor troops. We launched a vigorous Resist America, Aid Korea movement domestically, donating large quantities of aircraft and artillery to support our "most beloved people." Our volunteers have become the world's first-class army. Under the severe blows of our increasingly powerful Chinese and Korean people's forces, the American aggressors have been defeated and will suffer even greater defeats in the future. We Chinese people will not be intimidated by "germs." We must resolutely fight the American aggressors to the end! We will not rest until the American bandits are driven out.
    Fellow farmers, fathers, brothers, sisters, for the sake of the safety of all mankind, for the sake of our beloved motherland, for the sake of our beautiful and happy future, for the sake of our millions of descendants, we must not allow the inhumane American bandits to continue to harm mankind. We must take urgent action to continue to strengthen all practical work in resisting America and aiding Korea, thoroughly complete the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and further increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. Our agricultural production cooperatives, in order to fully support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, must concentrate all their efforts on increasing per-unit area yield on the basis of exceeding pre-war per-mu yield by 109% last year, and guarantee an increase of 53 jin of grain per mu, exceeding pre-war levels by 131.1%. We have now delivered all the fertilizer to the fields. In order to prevent drought and ensure timely sowing, the entire cooperative has accumulated 3,000 dan of snow water. We plan to open two dry canals and dig thirty-eight water storage pits. Our entire village has also drawn up a plan to achieve "every household raising pigs and building pens to accumulate fertilizer" before the autumn harvest. We are now preparing to buy two sows and twenty-eight piglets. We hope that all farmers, fathers, brothers, and sisters across the country will support our "most beloved people" with practical actions and repel the American bandits' germ warfare.

    用提高单位面积产量来打击美国侵略者
    全国农业劳动模范  李顺达
    当我在报纸上看到美国强盗不顾人类正义和国际公法，在朝鲜和我国东北、青岛等地进行细菌战的消息，我恨透了。我们村的农民都说：“这不是人干的事。”开天辟地以来，我们只知道人都不愿意生病，也不愿意叫别人生病，从没听说过有人制造疾病。但是这些还穿着人衣裳的美国野兽就偏偏在专门给人制造疾病。我们坚决抗议美国强盗这种没有人性的野兽行为。我们老百姓完全拥护中央人民政府外交部长周恩来二月二十四日和三月八日前后两次严正声明。我们要警告美国的战争贩子们：我们中国人民热爱和平，但绝不允许别人蹂躏我们。我们中国人民是在长期的战争中锻炼出来的。我们曾打败了实行“三光”政策的日本帝国主义，消灭了在美国帝国主义支持下的蒋介石匪帮。我们中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，把美国侵略军打得落花流水。我们在国内开展了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，捐献了大批的飞机和大炮，支援了我们“最可爱的人”。我们的志愿军已经成了世界上第一流的军队。在我们日益强大的中朝人民部队的严重打击下，美国侵略者失败了，将来还要遭受更大的失败。我们中国人民是不会被“细菌”吓倒的，我们要坚决向美国侵略者斗争到底！不赶走美国强盗，誓不休止。
    全国农民父老兄弟姊妹们：为了全人类的安全，为了我们可爱的祖国，为了我们美好幸福的将来，为了我们千千万万的后代儿女，决不允许灭绝人性的美国强盗继续危害人类。我们要紧急行动起来，继续加强抗美援朝的各项实际工作，彻底完成反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，更进一步增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。我们的农业生产合作社，为了全力支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，要在去年每亩产量超过战前百分之一百零九的基础上，集中全力提高单位面积产量，保证每亩增产五十三斤粮食，超过战前百分之一百三十一点一。现在我们已把肥料全部送到地里。为了防旱、保证及时播种，全社并积了三千担雪水。准备开旱渠两道，打蓄水坑三十八个。我们全村并订出计划，要在秋收前作到“家家养猪，修圈积肥”。现在又准备买两口母猪，二十八只猪娃。我们希望全国农民父老兄弟姊妹们，都要以实际的行动，支援我们“最可爱的人”，击退美国强盗的细菌战。
