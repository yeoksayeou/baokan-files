Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 9th: On the morning of March 7th, around 6:00 AM, American planes dropped germ bombs on Pyongyang. The Americans believed that under the cover of darkness, germ-carrying insects contained in the bombs could be easily spread. Residents of the house where the first germ bomb was discovered said they initially thought it was a time bomb, so they quickly left the house. After dawn, they discovered it was a germ bomb surrounded by swarms of flies and mosquitoes, so they notified the People's Committee.

The germ bomb was a thin, green metal cylinder with stabilizers, resembling a demolition bomb in shape, about 140 centimeters long and 40 centimeters in diameter. The inside of the cylinder was divided into four compartments, each with a small hole 3 centimeters in diameter. The germ bomb was equipped with a special device that would open the cylinder when it reached a certain altitude. If this device failed, the germ-carrying insects could still crawl out from the small holes in each compartment.

The Minister of Health of the Pyongyang City People's Committee said that the People's Committee and the Pyongyang Anti-epidemic Organization have taken all measures to deal with the American germ warfare.

American night bombers also dropped several of these germ bombs in the suburbs 20 to 30 kilometers around Pyongyang.

Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: While frantically engaging in germ warfare, the American aggressors continue indiscriminate bombing and strafing of peaceful towns and villages in Korea. According to TASS, Pyongyang: American jet planes bombed and strafed southern Pyongyang again on the morning of March 10th. The American aerial bandits' air raids destroyed several houses and killed several civilians.

American planes bomb areas near Pyongyang every day, strafing civilian residences and dropping incendiary fuel tanks on peaceful villages. On the afternoon of March 6th, six American planes attacked a village in Jiangdong County, South Pyongan Province. The American pilots dropped several fuel tanks, and the village immediately burst into flames. In one family, a mother and three children were all burned to death.

The entire Korean people express unparalleled anger at the crimes of the American aggressors in attempting to destroy the peaceful Korean people through germ warfare and bombing and strafing.

    美国侵略军飞机竟向平壤投掷细菌弹并继续对朝鲜和平城乡滥肆轰炸扫射
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社平壤九日讯：三月七日清晨六时左右，美国飞机在平壤投掷了细菌弹。美国人以为，在黑暗的掩护下，装在炸弹中投下的带菌昆虫可以很容易地散布开来。发现第一颗细菌弹的那家居民说，他们最初以为是定时炸弹，因此赶快离开那所房屋。天亮后，他们发现那是一颗细菌弹，周围布满成群的苍蝇和蚊虫，于是，他们就通知人民委员会。
    这颗细菌弹是一个绿色的薄薄的金属圆筒，上面装有平衡器，外形很像破坏炸弹，长一百四十公分左右，直径为四十公分。圆筒内部分为四格，每格都有一个直径三公分的小孔。细菌弹上装有特别装置，在细菌弹降落到一定高度时就会把圆筒打开。如果这个装置不起作用，带菌昆虫也可以从每个格子的小孔中爬出来。
    平壤市人民委员会保健部部长说，人民委员会与平壤防疫组织已采取一切措施，来对付美国的细菌武器。
    美国夜间轰炸机还在平壤周围二十到三十公里的郊区投下若干这一类的细菌弹。
    【新华社十一日讯】美国侵略者在疯狂地进行细菌战的同时，继续对朝鲜和平城乡滥肆轰炸扫射。据塔斯社平壤讯：美国喷气飞机在三月十日上午又轰炸扫射平壤南部。美国空中强盗的空袭，使几幢房子被毁，若干平民被击毙。
    美国飞机每天都空袭平壤附近地区，扫射平民的住宅并向和平村庄投掷引起燃烧的油箱。三月六日下午，美机六架袭击平安南道江东郡的一个乡村。美国飞行员扔了几个油箱，村子顿时发生大火，有一家，母亲和三个小孩全都葬身火窟。
    全朝鲜人民对于美国侵略者企图用细菌战和轰炸扫射来毁灭朝鲜和平人民的罪行，表示无比的愤怒。
