    Central Committee for Frugality and Inspection's Several Provisions Regarding the Handling of Corruption, Waste, and Overcoming Bureaucratic Errors
    (Approved by the 127th Political Affairs Council Meeting of the Government Administration Council on March 8, 1952)
    Currently, the Three-Anti Campaign in the country's special district-level and above organs and regiment-level and above troops is about to be basically completed. In order to correctly and uniformly handle certain issues related to the handling of corruption, waste, and overcoming bureaucratic errors discovered in the movement, the following provisions are made:

    First, Guiding Principles for Handling

    The handling of corrupt elements exposed in the Three-Anti Campaign must adopt the policy of combining transformation and punishment: lenient treatment for the majority whose circumstances are relatively minor or who have thoroughly confessed and rendered meritorious service to atone for their crimes; severe punishment for the minority whose circumstances are serious and vile and who refuse to confess. The handling of waste and bureaucratic issues should also be approached with a serious attitude, addressing situations individually to educate cadres and unite the masses. Only in this way can we uphold national laws and discipline, maintain and promote a clean, simple, and close-to-the-masses revolutionary work style. At the same time, only in this way can we consolidate the achievements of the Three-Anti Campaign and benefit the country's future construction work.

    Second, Methods for Handling Corrupt Elements

    1.  The handling of corrupt elements should adopt the following classification methods:

    (A) Those who have embezzled less than 1 million yuan, as long as their circumstances are not serious or vile, and they thoroughly admit their mistakes and guarantee not to repeat them, should not be regarded as corrupt elements, and no administrative punishment will be given. Among them, even if some have committed more serious offenses, but are still able to thoroughly confess, sincerely repent, and guarantee not to repeat them, they may also be exempted from being treated as corrupt elements and exempted from administrative punishment. In the above two situations, in addition to voluntarily returning the embezzled funds and goods, they generally do not need to be recovered. If there are those who stubbornly resist confessing, or whose circumstances are serious and vile, they should still be treated as corrupt elements, given appropriate administrative punishment, and the embezzled funds and goods should be recovered as appropriate.

    (B) Corrupt elements who have embezzled more than 1 million yuan but less than 10 million yuan, as long as their circumstances are not serious or vile, thoroughly admit their mistakes, and guarantee not to repeat them, will not be subject to criminal punishment, but should be given administrative punishment to varying degrees depending on the severity of their circumstances, and embezzled funds and goods should be returned as appropriate. If they are younger or have made a mistake and can voluntarily confess, or if they have actively participated in the Three-Anti Campaign after being discovered and have already rendered meritorious service to atone for their crimes, they may be exempted from being treated as corrupt elements, and no administrative punishment will be given, but embezzled funds and goods must be returned as appropriate. If any of these corrupt elements stubbornly resist confessing, or their circumstances are serious and vile, they should be subject to criminal punishment.

    (C) Corrupt elements who have embezzled more than 10 million yuan but less than 100 million yuan may be given appropriate criminal punishment, or be exempted from criminal punishment and only given administrative punishment, depending on the severity of their circumstances, the degree of their confession and admission of guilt, the return of stolen goods, and the reporting of meritorious service, but embezzled funds and goods should be recovered as much as possible.

    (D) Corrupt elements who have embezzled more than 100 million yuan should generally be given different criminal punishments depending on the severity of their circumstances, and embezzled funds and goods should be recovered. However, those who voluntarily confess, sincerely repent, return stolen goods, and report meritorious service in the anti-corruption struggle may also be exempted from criminal punishment and instead given appropriate administrative punishment.

    2.  Administrative punishments include six methods: warning, demerit, demotion in grade, demotion in position, removal from office, and expulsion. In execution, they should generally be handled leniently based on the thoroughness of the corrupt elements' confession and admission of guilt, and their participation in the Three-Anti Campaign to report meritorious service, etc., ordering them to atone for their crimes through meritorious service in their work. Expulsion should be used as little as possible to avoid being unable to make a living, wandering in society, and affecting social order. Those who are removed from office and cannot be retained in the original unit should be reassigned to work or concentrated for training and transformation by the personnel department.

    3.  Criminal punishments, in addition to those exempted from punishment, include five methods: institutional control (one to two years), labor reform (two to four years), fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment, and the death penalty. Fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment, and the death penalty can all be given a suspended sentence depending on the severity of the circumstances. Those subject to institutional control will remain in the institution to work with their crimes on their heads. During their period of control, they will not be promoted and will be deprived of their political rights, but will be given opportunities to study and have their necessary living expenses guaranteed. Those subject to labor reform will be concentrated in appropriate locations and departments to perform labor services. Those who are given a suspended sentence, a suspended fixed-term imprisonment, may not be detained, but instead use institutional control or labor reform methods to observe their future behavior. Suspended life imprisonment and suspended death sentences should both be carried out in custody, with forced labor, to observe their future behavior.

    4.  The calculation of the time of corrupt acts should generally start from the date of the founding of the People's Republic of China, i.e., October 1, 1949; but those whose corrupt acts are serious and vile, or have a consistent nature, or cause great public outrage, can be traced back to the date of liberation of major cities and provincial capitals. For places liberated after the founding of the People's Republic of China, it should be calculated from the date of liberation, but for uprising troops, it should be calculated from the date when the troops established a revolutionary political work system. For corruption cases before the founding of the People's Republic of China, if the circumstances are serious and vile and must be dealt with, or if there is great public outrage and they are reported by others, they can be handled as special cases.

    5.  Specific regulations will be made separately for the method of returning stolen goods by corrupt elements.

    Third, Methods for Handling Waste Issues

    1.  Overspending and extravagance in personal life

    (A) Reasonable overspending, that is, overspending necessary for personal life and work. Some of this overspending is due to unreasonable or imperfect systems in the past; if the overspending is roughly equal to the living standards of cadres of the same level, and has been approved by the appropriate leading organs, it should be considered legal; if it has not been approved, it should be considered that the procedures are incomplete, and the procedures can be completed retroactively, and should not be counted as waste. In the future, this system should be revised according to actual needs and financial possibilities.

    (B) Semi-reasonable overspending, although needed for personal life and work, but the overspending is too high compared to the general living standards of cadres of the same level, even if it has been approved in advance or afterward, the wasteful part must still be reviewed.

    (C) Extravagant overspending in personal life and work should be regarded as waste, and must be deeply reviewed and corrected immediately. In the future, the system should be strictly observed and publicly criticized within an appropriate range.

    (D) Squandering overspending in personal life and work is not only a serious waste of resources, but also includes corrupt enjoyment, which is close to the nature of corruption. In addition to strict criticism, handing over surplus items, and immediate correction, appropriate administrative punishment must also be given. Those with particularly serious circumstances can be discussed as special cases and given criminal punishment as appropriate.

    2.  Overspending and extravagance in collective life

    (A) Reasonable overspending in collective life, such as cadre welfare, family allowances, necessary receptions by organs, and necessary equipment for work, although there is overspending, it is reasonable and should not be regarded as waste. In the future, this system should be modified or established according to needs and possibilities.

    (B) Unreasonable overspending in collective life, such as extravagant meeting receptions and entertainment, excessive purchases, furnishings, and construction of organs, are all wasteful, and the responsible persons should make deep reviews and correct them immediately. Those with serious circumstances, the responsible persons will be given administrative punishment as appropriate.

    3.  Waste in business

    (A) Due to insufficient experience or no experience at all, the person in charge still causes waste in business despite working hard, such as waste and losses in construction and the use of operating expenses, the error should be strictly reviewed and not allowed to be repeated.

    (B) Waste and losses in business caused by the serious bureaucracy of the person in charge or the dereliction of duty of the managers, and there are no insurmountable difficulties, the relevant personnel who are directly responsible, in addition to strict review, must be given administrative punishment as appropriate. Those whose circumstances are serious and cause huge losses to the country can be discussed as special cases and given criminal punishment as appropriate.

    4.  It is generally not appropriate to investigate waste issues too far, and they should be handled based on the specific circumstances before the Three-Anti Campaign was launched.

    Fourth, Handling Steps and Approval Authority Issues

    1.  In order to enable organs, troops, schools, and state-owned enterprises to quickly eliminate the concerns of the vast majority of petty corrupt elements in the current Three-Anti Campaign, so as to facilitate education and transformation, and to concentrate efforts to basically complete the Three-Anti Campaign tasks in special district-level and above organs and regiment-level and above troops in March, all localities should basically handle those who are not considered corrupt elements before March 20, and strive to handle a batch of corrupt elements who are easier to handle and only subject to administrative punishment.

    After handling the aforementioned two batches of personnel or when the Three-Anti Campaign at all levels is basically completed, waste issues will be handled step by step.

    2.  The handling of those who are not considered corrupt elements and corrupt elements who are only subject to administrative punishment can be resolved in accordance with the following methods: first, convene all staff members of the unit (including all those temporarily under control due to suspected corruption or corruption), and announce the various principles for handling corruption and waste issues in the name of the Frugality and Inspection Committee of the people's government at all levels, and earnestly explain the above policies to the masses, then, after preparation by the frugality and inspection committee of each department, the organ is divided into groups for evaluation, the leadership approves, and then a general meeting is held to announce it.

    Among them, the approval authority for administrative punishment generally adopts the direct superior approval system, but the removal and expulsion punishments should be approved at two levels.

    3.  The handling of corrupt elements who should be subject to criminal punishment or exempted from criminal punishment, regardless of whether they are party, government, military, civilian, or academic workers, should be prepared by the frugality and inspection committee at all levels in accordance with these provisions, and then, under the leadership of the court or military law department, the people's court should be organized by appropriate administrative units for trial. The handling of this batch of corrupt elements who are subject to criminal punishment and the aforementioned corrupt elements who have not been completely handled and are subject to administrative punishment should be basically completed by the end of April by all units.

    Regarding the approval authority for criminal punishment, a skip-level approval system is generally adopted, but the approval authority for life imprisonment and exemption from punishment for major corrupt officials should be approved at two levels; all death sentences should be approved by the central government and major administrative regions.

    Fifth, Overcoming Bureaucratic Errors

    Regarding the issue of bureaucratic errors, in the Three-Anti Campaign, first, due to the leading cadres taking the lead, conducting self-criticism at all levels, and mass criticism, and then due to the exposure of corruption and waste phenomena from all aspects, the facts that illegal industrialists and businessmen launched rampant attacks on state organs, and many shortcomings in the work of state organs, the vast majority of leading cadres at all levels have deeply experienced the seriousness of the harm of bureaucratic errors to the country's cause in terms of ideology and work. Therefore, in the process of the Three-Anti Campaign, the fine style of close combination between leaders and the masses is rapidly and universally growing.

    Cadres who have committed serious bureaucratic errors should be criticized and even punished. Some of them have been removed from office or suspended, and some have not yet been finally dealt with. These cadres should be handled separately after handling corruption and waste issues, depending on the degree of their repentance, and given appropriate administrative punishment. As for the few leading cadres who have not yet thoroughly conducted self-criticism in the self-criticism at all levels, and the masses still have opinions on them, they should conduct further self-criticism in the construction phase of the Three-Anti Campaign and make appropriate conclusions.

    After basically completing the Three-Anti Campaign tasks, each unit must transition to the construction phase of the Three-Anti Campaign, that is, to further establish the thinking of the working class as the leader for all staff members, examine the policy thinking of the business work of each unit, streamline the organizational structure, and establish new systems for work, study, and life, in order to ensure from the aspects of ideology, style, organization, and system, to wash away the filth of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and establish a clean, simple, and revolutionary work style that serves the people.

    中央节约检查委员会关于处理贪污、浪费及克服官僚主义错误的若干规定
    （一九五二年三月八日政务院第一百二十七次政务会议批准）
    目前，全国范围内专区以上机关中及团以上部队中三反斗争任务，即将基本完成，为了正确地、统一地处理运动中所发现的有关处理贪污、浪费及克服官僚主义错误的若干问题，特作如下规定：
    第一、处理方针
    对于在三反运动中所揭发的贪污分子的处理，必须采取改造与惩治相结合的方针：对大多数情节较轻或彻底坦白，立功自赎者，从宽处理；对少数情节严重恶劣而又拒不坦白者，予以严惩。对浪费及官僚主义问题的处理，亦应以严肃态度，分别情况，予以适当解决，以教育干部，团结群众。只有这样，才能严肃国家法纪，保持与发扬廉洁朴素的、密切与群众结合的革命工作作风。同时，也只有这样，才能巩固三反运动的成果，有利于国家今后的建设工作。
    第二、对贪污分子的处理办法
    一、对贪污分子的处理，应采取如下分类办法：
    （甲）凡贪污未满一百万元者，只要其情节不严重恶劣，彻底承认错误，保证不再犯，一律不以贪污分子看待，并不予行政处分。其中虽有情节较重，但仍能彻底坦白、真诚悔过、保证不再犯者，亦可免以贪污分子论处，并免予行政处分。以上两种情况，除自动退回贪污款物外，一般可不予追缴。其中如有顽固抗拒坦白，或情节严重恶劣者，仍应以贪污分子论处，给以适当行政处分，酌退贪污款物。
    （乙）凡贪污超过一百万元、未满一千万元之贪污分子，只要其情节不严重恶劣，彻底承认错误，保证不再犯，一律不予刑事处分，但应按其情节轻重给以不同程度的行政处分，并酌退贪污款物。其中如系年岁较轻或偶一失足而能自动坦白者，或系发觉后积极参加三反工作并业已立功自赎者，得免以贪污分子论处，不予行政处分，惟须酌退贪污款物。此类贪污分子中如有顽固抗拒坦白，或情节严重恶劣者，应受刑事处分。
    （丙）凡贪污超过一千万元、未满一亿元之贪污分子，可依其情节轻重、坦白认罪程度、退赃和检举立功等情况，分别给以适当的刑事处分，或免刑而只予行政处分，但均应尽可能追缴贪污款物。
    （丁）凡贪污超过一亿元之贪污分子，一般均应按其情节轻重给以不同的刑事处分，追缴贪污款物，但自动坦白、真诚悔过、退出赃物、在反贪污斗争中检举立功者，亦可免予刑事处分，改给以适当的行政处分。
    二、行政处分采用警告、记过、降级、降职、撤职、开除六种办法。在执行时，一般应根据贪污分子坦白认罪的彻底程度及参加三反斗争检举立功等条件，从宽处理，责其在工作上立功自赎，尽量少用开除办法，以免无法生活，流浪社会，影响治安。其受撤职处分者，在本机关如无法留用，应由人事机关另行分配工作或集中训练，改造转业。
    三、刑事处分，除免刑者外，采用机关管制（一年至二年）、劳役改造（二年至四年）、有期徒刑、无期徒刑、死刑五种办法。有期徒刑、无期徒刑及死刑均得按情节轻重，宣告缓刑。受机关管制处分者，留在机关中戴罪工作，在其被管制期间，不叙职位并剥夺其政治权利，但给以学习机会，保障其必要的生活供给。受劳役改造处分者，集中在适当地点和适当部门实行劳动服务。宣告缓刑者，有期徒刑缓刑，可不关押，改用机关管制或劳役改造办法，以观后效。无期徒刑缓刑和死刑缓刑两种，均应实行关押，强迫劳动，以观后效。
    四、计算贪污违法时间，一般应自中华人民共和国成立之日即一九四九年十月一日算起；但其中贪污情节严重恶劣者，或带有一贯性者，或民愤甚大者，可追查到各地大城市和省城解放之日。凡在中华人民共和国成立以后解放的地方，应自解放之日算起，惟起义部队一律自该部队建立革命政治工作制度之日算起。在中华人民共和国成立以前的贪污案件，如情节严重恶劣必须处理，或民愤甚大而为人告发者，可作专案处理。
    五、对于贪污分子退赃办法，另作具体规定。
    第三、对浪费问题的处理办法
    一、个人生活的超支与铺张浪费
    （甲）合理的超支，即为个人生活与工作上所必需的超支。这种超支有些是由于过去所规定的制度不合理或不完善而产生；如其超支的情况与同等干部的生活水平比较大体相等，且又已经过适当的领导机关批准，则应认为合法；如未批准，应认为手续不完备，可补办手续，不应算作浪费。今后应根据实际需要与财政可能，修订这种制度。
    （乙）半合理的超支，虽为个人生活与工作所需要，但其超支的情况过高于同等干部一般生活水平，即便事前或事后经过批准，但其中浪费部分，仍须进行检讨。
    （丙）个人生活与工作上铺张性的超支，应作为浪费，必须深刻检讨，立即改正，今后应切实遵守制度，并在适当范围内予以公开批评。
    （丁）个人生活与工作上挥霍性的超支，不仅是严重的浪费行为，其中且有属于腐化性的享受，接近贪污的性质，除应进行严格批评、交出多余物品、立即改正外，并须酌予行政处分。其情节特别严重者，可作专案议处，酌予刑事处分。
    二、集体生活的超支与铺张浪费
    （甲）集体生活合理的超支，如干部福利，家属补助，机关必须的招待，工作上必要的设备等，虽有超支，但属合理，不应作为浪费。今后应根据需要与可能，修改或建立这种制度。
    （乙）集体生活不合理的超支，如带铺张性的会议招待、应酬，过分的机关购置、陈设、建筑等，均属浪费，主管人员应做深刻检讨，立即改正。其情节严重者，主管人员酌予行政处分。
    三、业务上的浪费
    （甲）由于经验不够或全无经验，负责人虽努力工作而仍然造成业务上的浪费，如建设方面和事业费使用上的浪费和损失，其错误应严加检讨，不许再犯。
    （乙）由于负责人严重的官僚主义或经管人员失职所造成的业务上的浪费和损失，而且并无不可克服的困难，其负直接责任的有关人员，除应严格检讨外，须酌予行政处分。其情节严重因而招致国家巨大损失者，可作专案议处，酌予刑事处分。
    四、对于浪费问题，一般不宜于追查过远，应依据三反斗争开展前的具体情况，予以处理。
    第四、处理步骤及批准权限问题
    一、为使各机关、部队、学校及国营企业在目前三反斗争中能迅速解除绝大多数小贪污分子的顾虑，以利于进行教育改造，并便于集中力量在三月份基本完成专区以上机关中和团以上部队中的三反斗争任务，各地均应于三月二十日以前，将不算作贪污分子的人员基本处理完毕，并争取将较易处理的只受行政处分的贪污分子处理一批。
    在前述两批人员处理后或在各级三反斗争基本完成时，再逐步处理浪费问题。
    二、对于凡不算作贪污分子及只受行政处分的贪污分子的处理，均可依照下列办法解决：首先召集本单位全体工作人员（包括所有因贪污嫌疑或贪污而被暂行管制者），以各级人民政府节约检查委员会名义宣布对贪污、浪费问题处理的各项原则，切实向群众说明上述政策，然后经过各部门节约检查委员会准备，机关分组评议，领导批准，再开大会宣布。
    其中行政处分的批准权，一般采取直接上级批准制，惟撤职、开除处分，应隔两级批准。
    三、对于凡应受刑事处分或免除刑事处分的贪污分子的处理，无论党、政、军、民、学工作人员，均应依据本规定，经各级节约检查委员会进行准备，然后在法院或军法部门的领导下，由适当的行政单位组织人民法庭，进行审判。对这批受刑事处分的贪污分子及前述未处理完毕的受行政处分的贪污分子的处理，各单位应争取在四月底基本完成。
    关于刑事处分的批准权，一般采取隔一级批准制，惟无期徒刑和大贪污犯免刑的批准权，应隔两级批准；所有判处死刑者，均应由中央及大行政区批准。
    第五、克服官僚主义错误问题
    关于官僚主义错误问题，在三反运动中，首先由于进行了首长带头，层层检讨，群众批评，继而由于从各方面揭露了贪污、浪费现象，不法工商业者向国家机关猖狂进攻的事实，以及国家机关工作中的许多缺点，各级大多数的领导干部，已从思想上工作上深刻地体验到官僚主义错误对于国家事业危害的严重性。因之在三反运动的过程中，领导与群众密切结合的优良作风，正迅速普遍地增长着。
    对于犯了严重官僚主义错误的干部，均应予以批评直至处分。其中有些已被撤职或停职者，有些则尚未作最后处理。对于这些干部均应在处理贪污、浪费问题之后，再分别情况，视其反省程度，予以适当的行政处分。至于在层层检讨中，少数领导干部自我批评尚不彻底，群众对之尚有意见者，应在三反运动的建设阶段再作检讨，并作出适当结论。
    各单位在基本完成三反斗争任务之后，必须转入三反运动的建设阶段，即是要使全体工作人员进一步树立以工人阶级为领导的思想，检查各单位业务工作的政策思想，精简组织机构，建立工作、学习、生活的新制度，以期从思想上、作风上、组织上、制度上，保证洗除贪污、浪费和官僚主义这些污毒，树立廉洁的、朴素的、为人民服务的革命工作作风。
