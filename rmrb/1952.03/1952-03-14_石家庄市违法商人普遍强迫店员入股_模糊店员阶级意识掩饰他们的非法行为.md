Illegal Businessmen in Shijiazhuang Universally Force Shop Assistants to Buy Shares
Obscuring Shop Assistants’ Class Consciousness and Concealing Their Illegal Activities

    In Shijiazhuang, illegal businessmen, in order to obscure the class consciousness of shop assistants and conceal their evil activities, planned and universally pulled shop assistants into shareholding after liberation. This is a vicious method of the bourgeoisie launching a frenzied attack on the working class.
    In Shijiazhuang's private businesses, before liberation, except for individual shop assistants who had "personal shares," there was no shop assistant stock capital at all. After liberation, the treacherous merchants, seeing that they could no longer openly engage in illegal activities as they did under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the new society, planned to use the "trap" of pulling shop assistants into shareholding in order to continue illegal operations. By the end of 1951, in the city's 47 private business sectors, out of 4,100+ shop assistants in 3,234 households, more than half were pulled into shareholding, excluding the 1,200+ shop assistants in four sectors such as barber shops, bathhouses, hotels, and restaurants. Among them, merchants in the tea, general merchandise, Chinese medicine, grocery, and cloth industries were the most rampant, and some stores even pulled all shop assistants into shareholding.
    There were two methods for treacherous merchants to pull shop assistants into shareholding: one was threats. For example, Yang Mingyuan, the manager of Hongxing Tea House, falsely claimed that the counter had little capital and the business was not doing well, asking shop assistants to invest their year-end bonuses, otherwise, the business would close. The other was enticement. For example, the manager of An'an Pharmacy, taking advantage of the distribution of year-end bonuses, said to the shop assistants: "If you don't need the money at home, put it on the counter as a share, and you will get dividends in the future." In reality, the shares that shop assistants joined were generally very small, and they could not get much dividend; some treacherous merchants secretly revised the accounts, reduced the amount of profit, and gave less dividend to the shop assistants. The targets of treacherous merchants' enticement were first and foremost those shop assistants whom they wanted to use to carry out evil deeds, such as accountants and runners; secondly, the backbone and activists among the workers, such as Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and trade union cadres. If shop assistants did not buy shares, the treacherous merchants would try to fire them. For example, Chunlong Tea House, in the autumn of 1950, under the pretext of "restructuring," dismissed 14 shop assistant activists at once; after the "restructuring," the newly hired shop assistants were forced to buy shares.
    After forcing shop assistants to buy shares, the treacherous merchants became rampant. They restricted shop assistants from participating in political activities, illegally exploited shop assistant labor, and unscrupulously stole state property. The treacherous merchant Yang Mingyuan illegally restricted shop assistants from joining the trade union, saying: "The trade union is an organization of workers. You are all 'shareholders' of the counter and should not join the trade union." Some store managers, in order to restrict shop assistants from participating in political activities and illegally exploit labor, even extended working hours to seventeen or eighteen hours. When shop assistants protested, they all deceptively said: "There is a share for you on the counter, so working more will earn more money. Attending meetings won't bring food or drink." Therefore, many shop assistants in the city, especially accounting personnel, did not even participate in great movements such as Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and Suppressing Counterrevolutionaries. In this way, the treacherous merchants unscrupulously stole state property in front of the shop assistants. For example, Huang Yongnian, the manager of Yongyu Lumber Yard, after pulling six shop assistants into shareholding at the end of 1949, forced the shop assistants to create false accounts for him, bribe cadres, and report less while delivering more. According to preliminary investigation, the treacherous merchant Huang Yongnian alone has stolen and defrauded state property worth more than 100 million yuan.
    After the launch of the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, use of substandard materials, and theft of state economic intelligence, the Shijiazhuang City District Thrift and Inspection Committees, in order to raise the class consciousness of shop assistants and mobilize the broad masses of shop assistants to encircle and suppress major thieves, have organized shop assistant propaganda teams and accounting training classes one after another to mobilize, educate, and organize the shop assistants who were tricked into "buying shares."

    石家庄市违法商人普遍强迫店员入股
    模糊店员阶级意识掩饰他们的非法行为
    石家庄市的违法商人为了模糊店员的阶级意识，掩饰他们的罪恶行为，解放后曾有计划地普遍拉店员入股。这是资产阶级向工人阶级猖狂进攻的一种恶毒手法。
    石家庄市私营商业中，解放前除个别店员有“人身股”外，根本没有店员的股金。解放后，奸商们看到在新社会里再不能像国民党反动统治时期那样公开地进行违法勾当，便有计划地采用拉店员入股的“圈套”，以达到继续进行非法经营的目的。到一九五一年底，全市私商四十七个行业三千二百三十四户的四千一百多店员中，除理发、澡堂、旅馆、饭馆等四个行业一千二百多店员外，被拉入股的竟占一半以上。其中以茶叶、百货、中药、杂货、布匹等行业的商户最为猖狂，有些商店甚至把全店店员都拉入股。
    奸商们拉店员入股的方法有两种：一种是威胁。如宏兴茶庄经理杨鸣远假说柜上资金少，买卖不好作，叫店员把年终奖金入股，否则就歇业。另一种是利诱。如安安药房的经理趁发年终奖金时，对店员说：“家里不等钱用，就放在柜上入股，将来分红利。”实际上，店员加入的股份一般都很小，分不了多少红利；有些奸商并暗地里修改账目，缩小利润额，少给店员的红利。奸商们拉拢入股的对象，首先是他们想利用进行罪恶行动的店员，如会计、跑外人员；其次是职工群众中的骨干和积极分子，如共产党员、青年团员和工会干部。店员如不入股，奸商就设法解雇他们。如春隆茶庄一九五零年秋季就藉口“改组”，一次解雇十四个店员积极分子；“改组”后，新雇的店员都被迫入了股。
    逼迫店员入股后，奸商们就猖狂起来了。他们限制店员参加政治活动，非法剥削店员劳动力，肆无忌惮地偷盗国家资财。奸商杨鸣远违法限制店员参加工会，他说：“工会是工人的组织，你们都是柜上的‘股东’，不应该参加工会。”有些商店经理为了限制店员参加政治活动和非法剥削劳动力，竟将工作时间延长到十七八个小时。当店员提抗议时，他们都欺骗地说：“柜上有你一份，多干活就多赚钱，开会也当不了吃喝。”因此全市不少店员特别是会计人员，连抗美援朝、镇压反革命等伟大运动都没参加过。这样，奸商们就肆无忌惮地在店员面前偷盗国家资财。如永裕木栈经理黄永年在一九四九年底把六个店员都拉入股后，就逼迫店员给他造假账，向干部行贿，交货时以少报多。据初步检查，奸商黄永年一人盗骗国家资财已达一亿多元。
    反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动开展后，石家庄市各区节约检查委员会为了提高店员的阶级觉悟，发动广大店员围剿大盗窃犯，已纷纷组织店员宣传队、会计训练班，向被骗“入股”的店员进行动员、教育和组织工作。（新华社）
