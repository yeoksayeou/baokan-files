    V. Changes in the ideological consciousness of cooperative members

    The seven-month experience of the cooperative shows that the ideological consciousness of its members has undergone, and is undergoing, significant changes.

    The most obvious change is the strengthening of collectivist thought. Cooperative member Guo Dongxian said: "In the past, our own land was our lifeline. Now, the land cooperative (i.e., agricultural production cooperative) is our collective lifeline." Zhang Zhuangxiu, a 52-year-old female cooperative member, said: "Before, everyone had their own ideas. Now, the whole cooperative has one heart." Members have shifted from a long-term focus on their individual land to primarily caring about the cooperative's land and sideline production. This is a major development. This is because the source of members' income no longer depends on the cultivation of their original land but on the cultivation of the cooperative's land and sideline production. Because labor income accounts for the major portion, members generally wanted to keep more private plots when the cooperative was established. Now, they generally decide to reduce their private plots to avoid weakening their income from labor. Members now universally demand the expansion of the cooperative's public property, such as requesting the construction of sheepfolds, cattle pens, and houses for use during threshing. Their views on public accumulation funds and public property have also undergone great changes. In the past, members generally requested to take a share when they left the cooperative. Now, almost all members oppose this idea. Actions to protect public property are gradually increasing. For example, four young cooperative members voluntarily took responsibility for guarding the grain in the field at night during the autumn harvest. All members take turns guarding the cooperative's flock of sheep at a very low cost. Some members provide their own brooms and cloth bags for the cooperative's use without compensation. Members are very generous when the cooperative needs to borrow something. Members in difficulty want to rely on the cooperative to solve their problems. When some members are sick, the cooperative finds a doctor for them, and other members cook for them.

    The strengthening of collective thinking is reflected in the growth of patriotic ideology in the political aspect. This is mainly reflected in patriotic donations and preferential treatment work. The cooperative donated a total of 430,000 yuan, accounting for 38% of the village's total donation of 1,131,100 yuan. Due to the increase in income, the members' enthusiasm for supporting the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has increased. Members demanded to eliminate the American aggressors outside the national borders. The increase in sideline income has increased the source of donations. Therefore, increased production guaranteed donations, and donations encouraged increased production. The cooperative's preferential treatment work in 1951 was even better than in 1950. The cooperative formulated an agreement to guarantee that the cultivation of land for military families and martyrs' families would be no lower than the level of cooperative members. It also ensured that military families and martyrs' families would not have any difficulty with firewood and water. The cooperative regularly conducts political study, and the cooperative subscribes to three newspapers. The cooperative proposed that not only should they be labor models, but they should also learn from Li Shunda and be patriotic models. The patriotic pact has become a powerful weapon for promoting the patriotic movement and production movement in this village. During the autumn summary in Chuandi Village, there were a total of 60 models of various types, and this cooperative accounted for 22 of them.

    Due to the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, members have a more urgent demand for cultural learning. The most prominent is that both male and female members universally request to be able to recognize "work vouchers" and be able to calculate accounts. Illiterate members have great difficulty issuing work vouchers, receiving work vouchers, and calculating work vouchers. Without the ability to calculate work vouchers, many people cannot understand the cooperative's economic situation and their own labor income before the actual distribution. Therefore, there are currently 29 people in the cooperative who are diligently learning abacus, and all 29 people have language and arithmetic textbooks. Young people learn to write every day, and Li Xicun, a 57-year-old member, also learns to write every day, in order to facilitate the study and research of agricultural production technology. In order to encourage members' cultural learning, the cooperative often rewards members with pens, paper, and ink.

    Due to the success of the agricultural production cooperative, farmers outside the cooperative in this village and in neighboring villages have also undergone ideological changes. When the agricultural production cooperative was being prepared in the spring of 1951, some people adopted a skeptical and wait-and-see attitude. They said: "You do it first, and I will see next year." Now, they have generally experienced the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives. The vast majority of farmers in this village who have not joined the cooperative request to join or organize agricultural production cooperatives. They all said in unison: "Individual farming cannot catch up with mutual aid teams, and mutual aid teams cannot catch up with land cooperatives (i.e., agricultural production cooperatives)."

    During the autumn harvest summary in 1951, the Pingding County Committee of the Communist Party of China convened 12 model mutual aid teams and 33 representatives from the entire county to visit Chuandi Village. These representatives universally requested to organize like the agricultural production cooperative in Chuandi Village.

    VI. Basic experience

    The basic experience of the Chuandi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative over the past seven months includes the following points:

    First, the members' transfer of the right to use most of their land to the cooperative for unified management is the basic key to forming an agricultural production cooperative of the Chuandi Village type. This is because only when the land is brought into the cooperative can its production efficiency be brought into play, the scattered labor force bound by the fragmented operation of small plots of land can be liberated, planned and rational unified management can be implemented, new agricultural implements and advanced technology can be widely adopted, and specialized sideline production can be carried out in a planned way. If the land is not brought into the cooperative, or only a small portion of the land is brought into the cooperative, it will not be possible to change the difficult situation already encountered by the mutual aid team. However, it is not advisable for members to bring all their land into the cooperative. There should be appropriate private plots for members to grow vegetables and other things. The private plots should not be too small or too large. If they are too small, they cannot meet the individual special needs of the members; if they are too large, they will increase the difficulty for members to participate in collective labor and will inevitably reduce their income from labor. However, the agricultural production cooperative cannot negate the members' private ownership of land. It must clearly recognize that the agricultural production cooperative is an economic organization based on unified management and collective labor on the basis of private ownership of land. It is a higher form of mutual aid team and is still the lowest form compared to the socialist collective farm, which is a transitional form toward the socialist collective farm.

    Second, on the basis of land being brought into the cooperative, the fundamental key to the aforementioned great changes that have taken place in the Chuandi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative is the implementation of the distribution principle of labor as the main factor and land as the secondary factor. Because labor is the main factor, it fundamentally changes the farmers' concept that land income has always been the main factor for thousands of years. In order to get more pay for more work, farmers are gradually changing the scattered habits of small producers and turning to work hard to seize opportunities. This greatly improves the labor productivity of farmers. Because this labor is collective labor under the unified management policy, farmers are gradually accustomed to the habit of division of labor and are gradually changing the "package deal", slow, and rough work style of the small-scale economy. However, under the new democratic system, the principle of distribution based on labor cannot eliminate the compensation for members' privately owned land. Members should still obtain income from the land they privately own. At the present stage, any attempt to abolish the members' private ownership of land is "leftist". When members cannot agree to the principle of distribution based on labor, it is also possible to temporarily implement the principle of distribution based on land.

    Third, the public accumulation fund must exist, but the proportion should not be too high. The initial proportion of the public accumulation fund formulated by the Chuandi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative was 20%. This proportion made it impossible for some farmers with more land and less labor to increase their income after joining the cooperative, and some even had the possibility of decreasing their income. Later, the current proportion (8%) was implemented. Although the proportion of income increase for all members was very unbalanced compared to the previous year, everyone was satisfied because their income had increased compared to their past income. It must be pointed out that although the lives of farmers are much better than in the past, in essence, their living standards are still very low. Agricultural production cooperatives must ensure that the annual income of members can continue to increase, that is, the lives of members can continue to improve. Only on this basis can public accumulation funds be gradually accumulated to add to the public property of the entire cooperative. Of course, the proportion of public accumulation funds should not be too low. If it is too low, it will weaken the power of agricultural production cooperatives to expand reproduction and cause the cooperative to lose its future. This is not in line with the long-term interests of every member and the country.

    Fourth, the experience of labor mutual aid is an important foundation for agricultural production cooperatives. Agricultural production cooperatives and the individual production of farmers have great differences. If individual farmers have not been trained in labor mutual aid, they will not have the habit of collective labor and will not have the ability to calculate work, divide labor, and cooperate. In the future, after agricultural production cooperatives have become quite popular, if individual farmers want to organize agricultural production cooperatives, they must also have trained backbones as the core.

    Fifth, joining and leaving the cooperative should be voluntary; there should be full democracy within the cooperative. Only when joining and leaving the cooperative are voluntary can members be spared worries about the fundamental nature of the agricultural production cooperative. Coercion and closed-doorism are extremely detrimental to the development of agricultural production cooperatives. It must be recognized that it is a major event in the minds and lives of farmers to bring their land into the cooperative for common use by the members. If crude methods are used to deal with such a key issue for farmers, serious mistakes will inevitably be made. After the agricultural production cooperative is formed, full democracy must be maintained within the cooperative, and criticism and self-criticism must be promoted; commandism within the cooperative must be resolutely opposed and prevented. Because the principle of distribution based on labor is a great dominant force for members. It is relatively easy for leaders to implement centralization on the basis of democracy. However, if the full democracy of members is not guaranteed, it is easy to create patriarchal leadership. Because of the attention to the principle of democracy, the Chuandi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative has successfully solved the problems of distribution ratio, the purchase of fertilizer from members, and unity among members. The accounts within the cooperative must be disclosed to the members regularly.

    Sixth, there must be strong leadership from the Party. Agricultural production cooperatives are more advanced and complex rural economic organizations than mutual aid teams. The village branch must be responsible for leading them. Strong Party members and backbones must be equipped in agricultural production cooperatives. In the pilot stage, the higher-level Party committee must send special cadres to provide concrete assistance, earnestly understand the situation during the organization process, and promptly solve the various problems that arise. The Party must guarantee the success of the agricultural production cooperative organization. Because agricultural production cooperatives implement unified management of land and labor and have public property, it is very difficult to clean up if they fail.

    Seventh, there must be help from the state-owned economy and supply and marketing cooperatives. The rapid development of the Chuandi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative is inseparable from the role of loans from the People's Bank of China. State bank loans rapidly expanded investment in reproduction and accelerated the accumulation of public property. Other state economic organs, such as the native products company, should combine their own businesses and try their best to open up avenues for sideline production for agricultural production cooperatives. The Changzhi Prefectural Native Products Company commissioned the Chuandi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative through the Pingding County Supply and Marketing Cooperative to make 500 wooden boxes for packing dangshen, which was of great help to the cooperative. However, because agricultural production cooperatives still lack experience in management, guidance should be given in matters such as signing contracts.

    VII. Several issues

    First, the issue of whether members should take away public accumulation funds and public property when they leave the cooperative. On this issue, the opinions of the members of the Chuandi Village Cooperative have changed. When the cooperative was first established, they advocated that they should be taken away; now, 99% of the members advocate that they should not be taken away. When arguing about this issue, there was only one reason for advocating taking them away, that is, they believed that the public accumulation funds and public property were created by the members' labor. Since each "laborer" had a share, they should have the right to take it away when they left the cooperative, otherwise it would hinder the right to private property. However, most members believe that: (1) public accumulation funds and public property are created by the collective labor of the members and do not belong to any individual. They should be enjoyed by the collective and cannot be distributed; (2) members who leave the cooperative have already enjoyed the fruits of their labor while in the cooperative, and their lives have improved, and their land has also been improved; taking away their own land and their private property when they leave the cooperative is already a great benefit and they cannot ask for another share; (3) the accumulation of public accumulation funds and public property is not only due to the collective labor of the members, but also to the help of the state-owned economy and supply and marketing cooperatives, etc., so individuals cannot take them away; (4) public accumulation funds and public property are constantly developing, and members are also changing. It is impossible to distinguish the part that each member's labor should have; (5) if public accumulation funds and public property are dispersed, they will inevitably weaken the cooperative's ability to expand reproduction and weaken the ability to carry out various public welfare undertakings, and it will be detrimental to the existence and development of the cooperative.

    In addition, some members advocate that new members should bring some membership fees when they join the cooperative; some people also advocate that new members should not pay membership fees in addition to land when joining the cooperative under the condition that public accumulation funds and public property cannot be taken away when they leave the cooperative.

    It now appears that the issue of whether members should take away public accumulation funds when they leave the cooperative under the condition that public property cannot be divided can be decided democratically by each cooperative.

    Second, the issue of the size of the organization. Members unanimously believe that bigger is better than smaller. They believe that bigger means more labor, more land, and more capital, which can develop. This is different from mutual aid teams. Mutual aid teams are not easy to manage if they are too big. However, the key issue is the strength of the leadership. According to the current situation of leading cadres, agricultural production cooperatives that are too large are not easy to control and a gradual expansion policy should be implemented.

    Third, the issue of leading cadres. On the one hand, the leadership work of agricultural production cooperatives is easier than that of mutual aid teams. The phenomenon of rushing to work and not obeying commands during busy farming seasons in mutual aid teams no longer exists. However, on the other hand, the production command work required by agricultural production cooperatives is much more intense and complex than that of mutual aid teams. Not only must agriculture be commanded, but also complex sideline production. There must be precise plans, relatively complex external negotiations, and internal persuasion and education work in many aspects. At the same time, leading cadres must also engage in physical labor like ordinary members. In this way, unnecessary losses are often caused because leading cadres do not have enough time to consider the work of the cooperative. Therefore, appropriate consideration should be given to the management work of leading cadres in the issue of calculating work. The accounting personnel of the production cooperative are very important. The government should plan to gradually train the staff of agricultural production cooperatives.

    Fourth, the issue of properly adjusting the labor of members. Because labor has become the main basis for distribution, members have been working non-stop every day in 1951. The cooperative does not have a unified system of rest, and no member is willing to rest alone. On the one hand, the labor productivity of members has greatly increased, changing the seasonal idleness of farmers; however, some members reflect that if this continues, their "lifespan will be shortened." Therefore, agricultural production cooperatives should formulate a unified and appropriate rest system for the entire cooperative based on the actual situation.

    Fifth, the issue of labor insurance for members. Members are unwilling to leave agricultural production cooperatives. However, they feel that if they continue to work like this, if members temporarily or permanently lose their ability to work, their lives will face fundamental difficulties. Therefore, there should be an appropriate labor insurance system.

    Sixth, the issue of caring for households with weak labor forces. At present, households with weak labor forces generally do not dare to join the cooperative, and the situation may become more serious in the future. Agricultural production cooperatives should try to enable various labor forces to obtain appropriate work as they develop. This is also a reason why mutual aid teams must continue to exist and develop on a considerable scale for a considerable period of time.

    五、社员思想意识的变化
    合作社七个月的经历，说明社员的思想意识已经而且正在发生相当明显的变化。
    最明显的是集体主义的思想加强了。社员郭东先说：“在过去，自己的土地是个人的命根子，现在土地合作社（即农业生产合作社）是我们的集体命根子。”五十二岁的老妇女社员张庄秀说：“从前是一个人一个心，现在是全社一个心了。”社员由长期的关心个人土地，变为主要关心全社土地及全社副业生产。这是一件大事。这是由于社员收入的来源已经不决定于原来自己的土地的耕作情况，而决定于全社土地的耕作情况和副业生产情况。由于劳动的收入占主要部分，社员的自留地在合作社成立时一般都要求多留；现在一般决定减少自留地，以免削弱他在劳动方面的收入。社员们现在普遍要求扩大社的公共财产，例如要求修羊圈、牛栏、打场时用的房屋等。对于公积金和公共财产的看法，也发生了很大的变化。过去普遍要求出社时能带走一份，现在则几乎全体社员都反对这种思想了。爱护公共财产的行为，逐渐增加。例如：四个青年社员，在秋收时夜间自动地负责看守场里的粮食。所有社员夜间以极低的代价轮流看护全社的羊群。有些社员把自己的扫帚、布袋，无代价地供给社里使用。为了合作社的需要，向任何社员借东西，社员们都很慷慨。社员有困难，都想依靠社来解决。有的社员病了，社里为他找医生，其他社员为他作饭。
    集体思想的加强在政治方面的表现，是爱国主义思想增长了。主要表现在爱国捐献和优抚工作方面。全社共捐献四十三万元，占全村捐献总数一百一十三万一千元的百分之三十八。由于收入的增加，社员们支援抗美援朝战争的热情加强了。社员们都要求消灭美国侵略者于国门之外。副业收入的增加，增大了捐献的来源。因此，增产保证了捐献，捐献又鼓励了增产。这个合作社一九五一年的优抚工作，比一九五○年有更大进步。全社订了代耕公约，保证军属烈属的土地耕作上不低于社员的这样高的水平。并保证军属烈属的柴水不发生困难。全社经常进行政治学习，社内订有三份报纸。全社提出不仅要做劳动模范，同时要学习李顺达的榜样作爱国模范。爱国公约已成为这个村推动爱国运动和生产运动的有力武器。川底村秋季总结时共有六十个各种类型的模范，这个合作社就占二十二个。
    由于农业生产合作社的成立，社员对文化的学习有更迫切的要求。最突出的是男女社员普遍要求能认“工票”、能算账。不识字的社员，对发工票、收工票、算工票感到极大的困难。有了工票不会计算，使许多人对于社的经济状况以及自己的劳动所得，在实际分配以前无从了解。因此，全社现有二十九个人努力学珠算，二十九个人都有语文和算术课本，青年们每天都学写字，五十七岁的老社员李喜存每天也学写字，为的是便于学习和研究农业生产技术。社里为了鼓励社员的文化学习，经常奖给社员笔和纸墨。
    由于农业生产合作社的成功，本村社外及邻村的农民也普遍起了思想变化。一九五一年春季筹备农业生产合作社时，有些人采取怀疑观望的态度。他们说：“你们先办，我明年再看。”现在，他们已普遍地体验到农业生产合作社的好处。绝大多数未入社的本村农民，都要求参加或者另外组织农业生产合作社。他们异口同声地说：“单干赶不上互助组，互助组赶不上土地社（即农业生产合作社）。”
    一九五一年秋收总结时，中共平顺县委召集全县十二个模范互助组、三十三个代表，到川底村去参观。这些代表普遍要求照川底村农业生产合作社的模样组织起来。
    六、基本经验
    川底村农业生产合作社七个月来的基本经验，有以下几点：
    第一、社员以自己的大部分土地的使用权交合作社统一经营，是组成川底村式的农业生产合作社的基本关键。因为只有土地入了社，才能发挥土地的生产效力，才能解放被分散经营的小块土地所束缚的分散的劳动力，才能够实行有计划的合理的统一经营，才能广泛地采用新式农具和进步的技术，也才能够有计划地从事专门的副业生产。如果土地不入社，或者只有小部分土地入社，就不能改变互助组所已经遇到的困难状况。但是，社员土地也不宜全部入社，应该有适当的自留地，供社员种植菜蔬等之用。自留地不能太少，也不能太多。太少了就不能满足社员个别的特殊的需要；太多了则增加社员参加集体劳动的困难，并且必然减弱他在劳动方面的收入。但农业生产合作社不能否定社员的土地私有权，必须明确地认识农业生产合作社是在土地私有基础上的统一经营和集体劳动的经济组织，是互助组的更高级的形式，同时比起社会主义集体农庄来还是最低的形式，也就是走向社会主义集体农庄的过渡形式。
    第二、在土地入社的基础上，川底村农业生产合作社之所以能够发生前述的巨大变化，根本的关键就是实行了以劳力为主、土地为副的分配原则。因为是以劳力为主，就根本改变着农民几千年来一向以土地收入为主的观念。为了多劳多得，农民逐渐改变着过去小生产者的散漫习惯，转而紧张地争取工作的机会。这就大大地提高了农民的劳动生产率。由于这种劳动是在统一经营方针之下的集体劳动，农民逐渐习惯了分工劳作的习惯，逐步改变着小农经济的“一揽子”的、迟缓的、粗糙的劳动作风。但是，在新民主主义制度下，以劳力为主的分配原则，并不能够取消社员私有土地的报酬。社员仍应取得他所私有的土地的收入。在目前时期，任何取消社员土地私有制的企图，都是过“左”的。在社员还不能同意以劳力为主的分配原则时，暂时实行以土地为主的分配原则，也是可以的。
    第三、公积金必须有，但比例不宜过高。川底村农业生产合作社最初拟定的公积金比例为百分之二十。这个比例，使少数地多劳动力少的农民入社以后的收入不能增加，部分的且有减少的可能。后来实行了现在的比例（百分之八）。所有社员的收入虽然比上一年收入增加的比例有很大的不平衡，但是因为比自己过去的收入都增加了，所以都很满意。必须指出：农民们的生活虽然比过去好得多了，但是就实质上讲来，生活水平还是很低的。农业生产合作社必须保证社员每年的收入能不断地增加，即社员的生活能不断地改善。只有在这样的基础之上，才可以逐步地积累公积金，添置全社的公共财产。当然，公积金的比例也不宜太低，太低了就要削弱农业生产合作社扩大再生产的力量，使合作社丧失了前途；这对于每一个社员和国家的长远利益都是不符合的。
    第四、劳动互助的经验，是农业生产合作社的重要基础。农业生产合作社和农民的个体生产，有很大的差异。个体农民如果没有劳动互助的锻炼，就没有集体劳动的习惯，不可能有计工算账分工合作的能力。在将来农业生产合作社已相当普及之后，个体农民如果要求组织农业生产合作社，也必须有经过训练的骨干作为核心。
    第五、入社出社应是自愿的；社内应有充分的民主。只有入社出社自愿，才能免除社员们对于农业生产合作社的根本性质的顾虑。强迫命令和关门主义，对于农业生产合作社的发展都是极端不利的。必须认识：农民把自己的土地加入合作社，由社员共同使用，是农民思想和生活上的一个重大事件。如果用粗暴的办法来处理农民的这样关键性的问题，必然会造成严重的错误。在农业生产合作社组成之后，社内必须保持充分的民主，发扬批评和自我批评；必须坚决反对和防止社内的命令主义。因为以劳动为主的分配原则，对于社员是一个极大的支配力量。领导者实行在民主基础上的集中，是比较容易的。但如果不保证社员的充分民主，容易造成家长制的领导。由于注意了民主的原则，川底村农业生产合作社在分配比例问题上，在购买社员的肥料问题上，在社员内的团结问题上，都得到了顺利的解决。社内的账目必须定期向社员公开。
    第六、必须有党的坚强领导。农业生产合作社是比互助组更高级更复杂的农村经济组织。村支部必须负责加以领导。在农业生产合作社中，必须配备坚强的党员和骨干。在试办阶段，上级党委必须派专门干部具体进行帮助，切实了解组社过程中的情况，及时解决所发生的各种问题。党必须保证农业生产合作社组织的成功。因为农业生产合作社实行了土地和劳力的统一经营而且有了公共财产，万一失败了，收拾起来，是很困难的。
    第七、必须有国营经济和供销合作社的帮助。川底村农业生产合作社的迅速发展，和人民银行贷款的作用是分不开的。国家银行贷款迅速扩大了再生产投资，并加速了公共财产的积累。其他的国家经济机关，如土产公司等，应结合自己的业务，尽量为农业生产合作社开辟副业的门路。长治专区土产公司经过平顺县供销合作社委托川底村农业生产合作社作五百个装党参的木箱子，对这个社是很大的帮助。但因农业生产合作社在经营上还缺乏经验，在订立合同等问题上，应给以指导。
    七、几个问题
    第一、社员出社时应否带走公积金和公共财产问题。在这个问题上，川底村社社员的意见是有变化的。初成立社时，他们主张应该带走；现在百分之九十九的社员都主张不带走。在争论这一个问题时，主张带走的理由只有一个，即认为公积金和公共财产是社员劳动创造的，“劳动”人各一份，既然出社，就应有带走的权利，否则是妨害了私有财产权。但是大多数的社员都认为：（一）公积金和公共财产，是社员集体劳动创造的，不属于任何个人，应由集体享受，不能分配；（二）出社的社员在社内时已享受了他劳动的成果，生活已经改善，他那一份土地也改良了；出社时带走他自己的土地和他的私有财产，已经得很大利益，不能要求再分；（三）公积金和公共财产的积累，不仅由于社员的集体劳动，还有国营经济和供销合作社等的帮助，个人更不能带走；（四）公积金和公共财产是不断发展的，社员也是变化的，不可能分清每个社员劳动所应得的部分；（五）公积金和公共财产如果分散，必然削弱社的扩大再生产的力量，削弱举办各种公益事业的能力，而且对于社的存在和发展是不利的。
    此外，有些社员主张新社员入社时应带些入社费；也有些人主张在出社时不能带走公积金和公共财产的条件下，新社员入社时除土地外可以不缴入社金。
    现在看来，在公共财产不能分的条件下，社员出社应否带公积金问题，可以由各社自己民主决定。
    第二、组织规模的大小问题。社员们一致认为大比小好。认为大了劳力多、土地多、资金大，能够发展。这和互助组不同，互助组大了不好办。但是，关键问题在于领导力量的强弱。照目前领导干部的状况，农业生产合作社过大是不容易掌握的，应当实行逐步扩大的方针。
    第三、领导干部问题。农业生产合作社的领导工作，一方面说比互助组要容易一些，互助组里农忙抢工不听指挥的现象已不存在。但是在另一方面，农业生产合作社所需要的生产上的指挥工作，却比互助组紧张复杂得多；不仅要指挥农业，而且要指挥复杂的副业生产。要有精密的计划，要有比较复杂的对外交涉，要有对内的多方面的说服教育工作。同时，领导干部还必须和一般社员一样从事体力劳动。这样，往往因为领导干部没有充分时间考虑社里的工作而造成不应有的损失。因此，对于领导干部的经营管理工作，在计工问题上，应给以适当的照顾。生产合作社的会计人员，十分重要。政府应有计划地逐步训练农业生产合作社的工作人员。
    第四、适当地调节社员的劳动问题。由于劳动成为主要的分配根据，社员们一九五一年都是每天不停地劳动。社里没有规定统一的休息制度，任何社员都不肯单独休息。一方面，社员的劳动生产率是大大地提高了，改变了农民季节性的闲忙状态；但是，有些社员反映，照这样下去，要“缩短阳寿”了。所以，农业生产合作社应该根据实际情况，规定全社统一的适当的休息制度。
    第五、社员的劳动保险问题。社员们对于农业生产合作社是不愿离开的。但他们感到，照这样劳动下去，社员一旦暂时或长期地丧失了劳动能力，生活将发生根本的困难。因此，应有适当的劳动保险的办法。
    第六、对劳力弱的农户的照顾问题。目前劳力弱的农户，普遍不敢入社，将来的情况可能更加严重。农业生产合作社应随着自己的发展，设法使各种不同的劳动力都能得到适当的工作。这也是互助组在相当时期相当广大的范围内还须继续存在和发展的一个理由。
