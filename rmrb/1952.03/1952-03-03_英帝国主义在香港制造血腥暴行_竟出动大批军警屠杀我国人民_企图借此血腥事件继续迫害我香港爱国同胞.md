Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd: The British Hong Kong government dispatched large numbers of military police on the 1st to carry out a planned and organized massacre of Chinese people. After staging this bloody atrocity, they are plotting to arrest our patriotic compatriots on a large scale. The reactionary and barbaric acts of British imperialism in persecuting Chinese residents in Hong Kong are escalating.

The massacre occurred at 3:45 PM on the 1st. On this day, the "Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City People's Organizations Delegation to Console Compatriots Affected by the Disaster in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon" decided to depart from Guangzhou to Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon, to offer condolences. Before departing, they received information that British imperialism was not only going to prevent the delegation from entering Kowloon but also plotting a large-scale persecution of the Chinese people. Therefore, as a precaution, they announced a postponement and notified the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce by telephone to inform the people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon who were preparing to welcome them at the station. However, the people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon, who were eagerly awaiting the delegation, had already gone to the station to welcome them before receiving this news, numbering more than ten thousand. After learning about the postponement, they left the station in an orderly manner. However, on their way home, they were attacked by British military police in a planned and organized manner. The British military police first provoked the crowd with police patrol cars, driving the cars head-on into the crowd, injuring a girl of about ten years old, and continuing to rush towards other people. The crowd was extremely indignant and immediately protested to the British military police. At this time, a large number of fully armed British military police, traveling in police cars, charged at the crowd and threw more than a dozen tear gas canisters. The attacked crowd was forced to change their route. This group of British military police followed closely and continued to throw a second batch of tear gas canisters at the crowd. At around 4:50 PM, the crowd was subjected to an even more brutal attack in front of the Mong Kok Police Station on Argyle Street. In addition to throwing tear gas canisters at the crowd, the police station also opened fire on the crowd, seriously wounding three Chinese compatriots on the spot. Chen Dayi was hit by several bullets and his life is in critical condition. Subsequently, the British police station mobilized hundreds of "riot police," traveling in armored vehicles to charge at the crowd and arrest people, and throwing a large number of tear gas canisters. This massacre did not stop until 5:45 PM. As a result of several attacks and massacres by the British military police, many Chinese people were injured, one of whom was seriously wounded, and three were wounded by gunshots. More than one hundred people were arrested by the British police.

After creating this bloody atrocity, the Hong Kong British government's information office summoned reporters from various newspapers, where a senior British police officer made a statement, claiming that "about one hundred people will be arrested as a result of this incident." This proves that the British imperialists are also attempting to continue persecuting our patriotic people in Hong Kong through this bloody incident, implementing their plan for a large-scale arrest that was devised more than a month ago.

    英帝国主义在香港制造血腥暴行
    竟出动大批军警屠杀我国人民
    企图借此血腥事件继续迫害我香港爱国同胞
    【新华社广州二日电】香港英国政府在一日出动大批军警，有计划、有布置地屠杀中国人民。他们并在演出血腥暴行之后，阴谋大规模逮捕我爱国同胞。英帝国主义在香港迫害中国居民的反动野蛮行为，正有加无已。
    屠杀事件发生于一日下午三时四十五分，这一天“广东省、广州市各界人民团体慰问九龙东头村受灾同胞代表团”决定由广州前赴九龙东头村慰问，临行前因接到消息，英帝国主义不特要阻拒慰问团进入九龙，而且布置迫害中国人民的大阴谋，故为慎重起见，宣布改期出发，并以电话通知香港华商总会，请他们转告准备到车站欢迎的香港、九龙各界人民。但对慰问团热诚盼待的香港、九龙各界人民，在得知这项消息之前已纷纷前往车站欢迎，数达一万多人。他们知道慰问团改期出发的消息后，有秩序地离开车站。可是，他们在归家途中，遇到英方军警有计划、有布置地袭击。英国军警首先用警察巡逻车向群众挑衅，把车迎面驶向人丛，将一个十余岁的女孩子碰伤，并继续向其他群众冲去。群众极为激愤，即向英国军警提出交涉。此时即有大批英国军警，配备全副武装，乘警车向群众冲击，并向群众投掷催泪弹十多枚。受袭击的群众被迫转道而走。这批英国军警就衔尾前进，并接连向群众投掷第二批催泪弹。在四时五十分左右，群众在亚皆老街旺角警署前，受到更残酷的袭击。该警署警察除向群众投掷催泪弹外，还开枪向群众射击，当场有三位中国同胞被击重伤，其中陈达仪身中数弹，生命危殆。接着英国警署调集了“突击冲锋队”数百人，分乘装甲车向群众冲击和逮捕群众，并大量投掷催泪弹。这一屠杀事件直到五时四十五分始行停止。中国人民在英国军警几次袭击屠杀下，受伤人数甚多，其中一人被击重伤，三人中枪弹受伤。有一百多人被英警拘捕。
    在制造血腥暴行之后，香港英国政府的新闻处召集各报记者，由英国高级警官发表谈话，声言“因此次事件将予拘捕者有一百人左右”。这证明英帝国主义者还企图借此血腥事件继续迫害我香港的爱国人民，遂行他们在一个多月以前的大逮捕阴谋计划。
