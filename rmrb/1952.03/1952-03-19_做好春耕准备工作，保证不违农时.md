Xinjiang Military Region Production Troops Do a Good Job in Preparing for Spring Plowing
    The production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region have done a good job in preparing for spring plowing. The soldiers' production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high, striving to over fulfill the plan of cultivating 1.6 million mu of farmland and striving for a bumper harvest of grain and cotton.
    Responding enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, the soldiers, after last year's winter storage and at the beginning of this year, have been stepping on ice and snow in the fertile Ili River Valley, on the banks of the Manas River, on both sides of the Kaidu River, in the oases of southern Xinjiang, and around the newly established mechanized farms, to carry out spring plowing preparations such as accumulating fertilizer, repairing ditches, repairing tools, and selecting seeds. In order to increase the yield per unit area, each unit held agricultural training classes for one month to forty days, concentrating on production experts to summarize the production experience of the past two years. The trainees systematically studied the alkali land drainage method, pest and disease control method, vernalization method of cotton and wheat, corn detasseling and artificial pollination method, and various crop cultivation methods. As soon as the Tianshan snow melts, the frontier labor soldiers will use tractors and animal-drawn farm implements to start plowing together.

PLA Troops Stationed in Lhasa Launch Spring Production Campaign
    The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa enthusiastically launched a spring production campaign.
    In mid-February, as the Lhasa Plain just thawed, the soldiers began production labor. Now, joyous labor songs are echoing everywhere on the Lhasa Plain. The virgin land that has been barren for many years has been transformed into patches of fertile land. The soldiers are transporting millions of catties of fertilizer down the river to the fields on the Lhasa River. The yak-hide boats transporting fertilizer shuttle back and forth on the Lhasa River all day long. After completing the fertilization work ahead of schedule, a certain unit has made all preparations before sowing, and even the ridges in the vegetable garden have been divided. As the weather warms up a little, seeds of various grains and vegetables can be sown.
    In the production campaign, the soldiers overcame the difficulty of lacking tools with high labor enthusiasm. They cut willow branches from the mountains and wove them into many baskets, cages, winnows, and other tools. The soldiers also manufactured a large number of plows, harrows, and hoes. In order to ensure a good harvest, the soldiers are building a canal as long as eight Chinese miles. In less than half a month since the start of this project, four-tenths of the entire project has been completed.

Northeast Provinces Send Cadres to Inspect Drought Prevention and Farming Preparation Work
    All provinces in the Northeast have sent a large number of cadres to the countryside to conduct a general and in-depth inspection of drought prevention and farming preparation work. The leading organs at the county level in the five provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning West, Liaoning East, and Rehe have temporarily suspended the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in accordance with the instructions of the Northeast People's Government, and concentrated their efforts on leading the drought prevention and farming preparation work. The main responsible cadres of the people's governments and the CCP committees of these counties have all gone to the countryside. Pingquan County in Rehe Province has transferred more than half of the county's cadres to the countryside. The six work groups sent by the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government have a total of more than 300 people. More than 1,000 cadres have been sent to villages in 20 counties including Tailai, Hailun, and Tai'an.

Central South Economic Departments Help Farmers Solve Difficulties in Spring Plowing
    Economic departments in various places in the Central South region are actively helping farmers solve various difficulties in spring plowing production. The agricultural loans issued by the branches of the People's Bank of China in the Central South region this spring are more than double that of last year. The fertilizer loans issued by cooperatives in the Central South region and the funds used to supply fertilizer are more than seven times that of last year. At present, the fertilizer purchased by cooperatives in various places has reached more than two-thirds of the original plan. Supply has begun in many areas of Henan Province. State-owned trading companies in various places in the Central South region are also generally supplying agricultural implements to farmers this year. The Liuzhou Trading Company in Guangxi used more than 55,000 catties of pig iron to make various agricultural implements to supply to farmers in the district. The Henan Provincial Trading Company supplied farmers with about 4 million agricultural implements. State-owned native produce companies, livestock companies, and oil companies in the Central South region have invested large amounts of funds to purchase flue-cured tobacco, fresh eggs, oils, and other native products, enabling farmers to obtain a lot of production funds.

Southwest Cooperative Business Administration Allocates Large Amounts of Fertilizer
    The Southwest Cooperative Business Administration is allocating a large amount of bean cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer to supply farmers for spring plowing. This year, the bureau's focus on supplying fertilizer is in industrial raw material crop areas and major grain-producing areas. The fertilizer supplied by cooperatives throughout the region this year is enough for more than 9 million mu of farmland to be used as base fertilizer and top dressing. More than 3,000 tons of chemical fertilizer transferred by the National Cooperative General Agency and bean cake transferred from outside the region are now being transported to rural areas.

    做好春耕准备工作，保证不违农时
    新疆军区生产部队做好春耕准备工作
    新疆军区生产部队已做好春耕准备工作。战士们生产情绪空前高涨，争取超额完成耕种一百六十万亩农田的计划，并争取粮棉大丰收。
    热烈响应毛主席增产节约号召的战士们，在去年冬藏后和今年年初，即纷纷在土地肥沃的伊犁河谷、玛纳斯河畔、开都河两岸、南疆绿洲和各新诞生的机械化农场的周围，踏着冰雪，进行积肥、整修水渠、修理工具、选种等春耕准备工作。为了提高单位面积产量，各部举办了一个月至四十天的农业训练班，集中生产能手，总结两年来的生产经验。训练班学员对于碱地排碱法、病虫害防治法、棉花和小麦春化法、玉米去雄蕊选种和人工受粉法，以及各种农作物栽培法等，均系统地进行了研究和学习。一等天山雪融，边疆劳动战士们即将使用拖拉机和马拉农具一齐开犁。
    驻拉萨解放军展开春季大生产运动
    人民解放军驻拉萨部队热烈展开春季大生产运动。
    二月中旬，拉萨平原刚刚解冻，战士们就开始生产劳动。现在，拉萨平原上到处荡漾着愉快的劳动歌声，荒芜了多少年的处女地，已变成了一片片的良田，战士们正在拉萨河上把几百万斤肥料运到下游的田里去。运肥料的牛皮船整天穿梭似地往来在拉萨河上。某部在提前完成施肥工作后，已经做好播种前的一切准备工作，连菜园里的畦子都分好了，天气稍暖，即可播种各种谷物和菜蔬的籽种。
    在生产运动中，战士们以高度的劳动热情，克服了缺乏工具的困难。他们从山上砍下柳条，编成许多筐、笼和簸箕等工具。战士们还制造了大量的犁耙和锄头。为了保证丰收，战士们正在修筑一条长达八华里的水渠。这个工程开工还不到半个月，就已完成了全部工程的十分之四。
    东北各省派出干部检查防旱备耕工作
    东北各省都已派出大批干部，下乡普遍深入检查防旱备耕工作。黑龙江、吉林、辽西、辽东、热河五省县一级的领导机关，都已根据东北人民政府的指示，暂时停止了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，集中力量领导防旱备耕工作。这些县的人民政府和中共党委的主要负责干部都已下乡。热河省的平泉县已抽调了全县半数以上的干部下乡。黑龙江省人民政府派出的六个工作组共有三百多人。泰来、海伦、泰安等二十个县派到村屯的干部共有一千多人。
    中南经济部门帮助农民解决春耕困难
    中南区各地经济部门积极帮助农民解决春耕生产中的各种困难。中国人民银行中南区各省分行今春发放的农贷，相当于去年的两倍多。中南全区合作社发放的肥贷和用以供应肥料的款项，超过去年七倍多。目前各地合作社收购的肥料已达到原定计划的三分之二以上。河南省不少地区已开始供应。中南区各地国营贸易公司今年也普遍地供应农具给农民。广西柳州贸易公司用五万五千多斤生铁制成各种农具，供应该区农民。河南省贸易公司供应农民的农具有四百万件左右。中南区国营土产公司、畜产公司、油脂公司已投放大量款额收购烤烟、鲜蛋、油类等各种土产，使农民得到了很多生产资金。
    西南合作事业管理局调拨大量肥料
    西南区合作事业管理局正调拨大量豆饼肥料和化学肥料，供应农民进行春耕。该局今年供应肥料重点是在工业原料作物区和主要粮产区。全区合作社今年供应的肥料，足够九百多万亩农田施基肥及追肥的需要。该局由全国合作总社调来的三千多吨化学肥料和外区调来的豆饼等，现在正源源地运到农村中去。　（据新华社消息）
