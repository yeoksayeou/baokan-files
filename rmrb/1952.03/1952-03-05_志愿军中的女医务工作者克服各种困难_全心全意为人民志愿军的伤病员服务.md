Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 4th: Our correspondent reports: Countless female medical workers of the New China, fighting on the Korean battlefield, are rescuing, treating, and nursing the wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army with selfless dedication, enabling many of them to quickly recover their health and return to the front lines to kill the enemy.

In combat, the female medical workers of the Volunteer Army put forward the slogan "We will follow the troops wherever they fight." They overcame various difficulties and hardships and persisted in rescue and treatment work in a tense combat environment. Sun Jizhen and Sun Bingzhen, two sisters working as nurses in a certain unit, carried more than 30 pounds of equipment and marched with the soldiers in the cold night at minus 30 degrees Celsius. The troops climbed a high mountain of more than 50 li, and the snow was over their knees, their shoes and feet frozen together; but they always followed the troops to their destination and immediately started working. Among the female medical personnel, it was common to endure hunger, cold, and fatigue to serve the wounded and sick soldiers day and night. Nurse Gao Kouying, with the wards very dispersed, once ran around the mountains for three days and three nights without rest to take care of the wounded, and made four or five liquid meals for the wounded every day, while she herself was so busy that she only ate once a day. Female nurse Zhao Guizhen cared for more than 30 wounded soldiers alone, feeding them more than 90 times a day and giving them more than 60 injections. She also squeezed out time to wash clothes for the wounded, moving them to call her "Sister Zhao."

The love of the female medical workers for the wounded and sick soldiers is meticulous. They said, "The soldiers are wounded and sick for the sake of defending the motherland, they are the most glorious people; we must serve them wholeheartedly, and if necessary, we can even contribute our own lives." Wherever they went, they disregarded the fatigue of long marches and worked with the male medical workers to make various safety preparations for the wounded and sick soldiers. In times of emergency, they did not hesitate to sacrifice their own lives to protect the safety of the wounded and sick soldiers. For example, when a certain hospital was suddenly bombed and strafed by enemy planes, nurse Wang Zhangying, who was in the ward, saw that there was no time to rescue the wounded, so she rushed to the wounded without hesitation and shielded them with her own body. Although she was injured herself, she protected the safety of the wounded. When the operating room of a certain hospital was hit by enemy planes and caught fire, nurse Zhang Jiande immediately took off her cotton coat and rushed into the fire, braving the strafing of enemy planes, to rescue medical equipment; as soon as the medical equipment was rescued, the ward caught fire again; she immediately rushed into the ward and, together with three other nurses, carried out sixteen wounded soldiers, so that no personnel or materials were lost. One cold night, nurses Wang Min and Liu Xiangyun, in order to send 36 wounded soldiers to a safe area, rolled up their trousers and carried the wounded across an icy river. The cold river water splashed on their legs and immediately froze into ice flakes, and their legs were frozen numb, but they endured it, making thirty-six trips back and forth, and finally transferred the wounded to a safe area.

Many model units have also emerged on the medical front. In a certain field hospital, there is a model nursing company, and the female staff members of the company account for more than 90 percent of the total number of the company. In the march to the 38th parallel in the winter before last, each of them carried 40 pounds of rice bags, bedding, iron picks, and first aid medicines, and followed the troops forward on the frozen roads. After arriving at the garrison, they climbed the mountains to cut wood and built the wards with their own hands. In order to overcome the difficulties of lack of medical equipment and medicines, they created various substitutes to assist in the treatment work. In more than half a year, all 73 female staff members of the company volunteered to give blood to the wounded for a total of 16,000 cc in order to rescue the wounded, saving 27 critically ill soldiers. Many people had continuous blood transfusions four times, and still persisted in working after the transfusions. They said, "The more anti-American and aid-Korea soldiers we save, the more American bandits we kill." The selfless dedication of the staff of the company to serving the wounded and sick soldiers has won high praise from the wounded and sick soldiers, who affectionately call the company the "Daughters of China Company." All the soldiers who recovered and returned to the team said that after returning to the front line, they would fight the enemy more bravely and repay their love with greater victories.

    志愿军中的女医务工作者克服各种困难
    全心全意为人民志愿军的伤病员服务
    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】本社记者报道：战斗在朝鲜战场上的无数新中国女医务工作人员，以忘我的工作精神，抢救、治疗和护理中国人民志愿军伤病员，使许多伤病员得以迅速恢复健康，重返前线杀敌。
    在战斗中，志愿军的女医务工作人员提出了“部队打到那里我们跟到那里”的口号。她们克服了各种困难和艰苦，在紧张的战斗环境中坚持救护和治疗工作。某部的女看护孙吉贞和孙冰贞姊妹两人，背了三十多斤重的装备，在零下三十多度的寒夜里与战士们一道行军前进。部队翻越一座五十多里路的高山，大雪没过膝盖，鞋和脚被冻结成一起；但她们始终跟着部队到达目的地，而且又立即开始进行工作。在女医务人员中，忍受饥寒疲劳夜以继日地为伤病员服务是很普遍的事情。看护高寇英在病房非常分散的情况下，有一次曾三天三夜不休息，满山奔跑着照顾伤员，每天并给伤员做四、五次流汁饭，而自己忙得一天仅吃一次饭。女护士赵桂珍一个人护理伤员三十多名，每天要给伤员喂饭九十多次，打针六十多次，她还挤出时间来给伤员洗衣服，感动得伤员们都叫她“赵大姊”。
    女医务工作人员对伤病员的热爱是无微不至的。她们说“战士们是为了保卫祖国而负伤和生病的，他们是最光荣的人；我们要全心全意为他们服务，必要时我们甚至可以贡献出自己的生命。”她们每到一地，便不顾长途行军的疲劳，与男医务工作者一道为伤病员做好各种安全准备。在情况危急时，她们不惜牺牲自己的生命，去保护伤病员的安全。如某医院突然遭到敌机的轰炸扫射，正在病室内的女护士王章英看到来不及将伤员救出，她便不顾一切地扑在伤员身上，以自己的身体掩护伤员。她自己虽然负了伤，却保护了伤员的安全。当某医院的手术室被敌机击中起火时，女护士张建德马上脱掉棉衣，冒着敌机的扫射，冲入大火中抢救医疗器材；医疗器材刚抢救出，病房又着了火；她又立即冲入病房，和其他三个护理员一道背出了十六个伤员，使人员物资都没有受到任何损失。在一个寒冷的夜晚，女护士王敏、刘相云为了把三十六个伤员能送到安全地带，曾卷起裤子背着伤员涉过一条冰冷彻骨的河流。寒冷的河水溅到腿上立刻结成冰片，腿部冻得失去知觉，但她们忍受着，往返三十六趟，终于把伤员转送到安全地带。
    在医疗战线上并涌现出许多模范单位。在某野战医院里有一个模范护士连，该连的女工作人员占该连总人数的百分之九十强。在前年冬天向三八线的进军中，她们每人背着米袋、被包、铁镐和急救药品等四十斤重的东西，在冰雪封冻的道路上，跟随部队前进。到达驻地后，她们又攀上山岭砍伐木料，亲手修建病室。为了克服医疗器材和药品等缺乏的困难，她们曾创造了各种代用品来辅助治疗工作。在半年多的时间内，全连七十三个女工作人员为了救护伤员，曾自动给伤员输血共一万六千西西，挽救了二十七名伤势垂危的战士。许多人曾连续输血四次，而在输血后仍坚持工作。她们说：“我们多救好一位抗美援朝的战士，就等于多杀了几个美国强盗。”该连工作人员这种忘我地为伤病员服务的工作精神，曾获得伤病员们崇高的赞誉，伤病员们亲切地称呼这个连队是“中华女儿连”。所有痊愈后归队的战士都表示，回到前线后要更英勇地打击敌人，用更大的胜利来答谢她们的热爱。
