    Tianjin Music Workers Should Quickly Correct the Mistake of Neglecting Workers' Musical Activities

    To the Editor: Mass singing activities in Tianjin flourished for a period after liberation, especially among the working class. These activities became an important weapon for promoting production, strengthening unity, and raising political awareness. However, at present, musical activities among Tianjin workers have completely stagnated. In some factories, such as the No. 2 and No. 5 Cotton Mills, the original singing organizations have all collapsed. The "Workers' Music Troupe" of the Tianjin "Workers' Cultural Palace," which once had over a hundred members, also stopped its activities at the end of last year.

    Professional music groups look down on workers' musical activities, and music workers lack interest in mass musical movements. The organizational members of the New Song Chorus, jointly led by the Tianjin Musicians Association and the All-China Musicians Association, are mostly office workers and students. When the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions introduced two workers to participate, the New Song Chorus rejected them because they were not good at reading music. When the Music Working Group of the Central Conservatory of Music was in Tianjin, it had the responsibility of guiding musical activities in factories, but they did not attend the workers' music forum organized by the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions. Workers from the No. 5 and No. 4 Cotton Mills reflected that music workers used to go to the factories to lead them in singing, but they haven't been seen since.

    The creation of songs is also very poor. Workers feel that there are too few songs about workers, and there have been almost no songs like "We Workers Have Strength" in recent years. Popular songs among workers are songs like "Women's Freedom Song" and "Autumn Harvest" from the film "The White-Haired Girl." These songs were not promoted by singing organizations, but rather a few comrades knew how to sing them, and some people learned by following along; or they learned by listening to records. In 1950, there were many musical creations by workers in Tianjin, and nine workers won awards. However, at the end of 1951, when the Cultural and Educational Department of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions summarized its work, only Han Ruixiang, a worker from the No. 2 Cotton Mill, submitted three song creations. Han Ruixiang is very distressed in his creative work and urgently hopes to get help from professional music workers, but he cannot find the opportunity. He once wrote a song and sent it to the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles, but the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles returned the manuscript to him only after half a year. He also wrote an opera and sent it to the Tianjin Daily, and the Tianjin Daily replied after two months saying that the manuscript had been transferred to the Central Conservatory of Music, but the Central Conservatory of Music has not yet processed it.

    Tianjin is an industrial city with more than 500,000 workers. The Tianjin Musicians Association should bear the main responsibility for allowing workers' musical activities to stagnate and develop spontaneously. The All-China Musicians Association also bears responsibility for the lack of ideological leadership over the Tianjin Musicians Association. The mistake of music workers divorcing themselves from the working masses and neglecting the workers' mass music movement is serious. It is hoped that this mistake will be quickly corrected and the Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line will be earnestly implemented, so that literature and art can serve the workers, peasants and soldiers, and in the cities, it should first serve the working masses.

### 天津音乐工作者应速纠正忽视工人音乐活动的错误

    天津音乐工作者应速纠正忽视工人音乐活动的错误
    编辑同志：天津市群众性的歌咏活动，解放后曾有一段时间搞得很活跃，尤其工人群众的歌咏活动，曾成为推动生产，加强团结，提高政治觉悟的重要武器之一。可是，目前天津市工人的音乐活动完全陷于停顿状态。有些工厂，如棉纺二厂和棉纺五厂，原来的歌咏组织全部垮台了，天津市“工人文化宫”原有一个百余人的“工人音乐团”，从去年年底也停止了活动。
    专业的音乐团体轻视工人音乐活动，音乐工作者们对于群众的音乐运动缺乏兴趣。天津市音乐工作者协会和中华全国音乐工作者协会共同领导的新歌合唱团的组织成员，多是机关职员和学生，天津市总工会曾介绍了两个工人去参加，新歌合唱团嫌他们看谱能力差，不收他们；中央音乐学院的音乐工作团在天津时期，对工厂的音乐活动是有辅导责任的，但天津市总工会举办了工人音乐座谈会，他们却不去参加。棉纺五厂和棉纺四厂的工人反映：过去音乐工作者还去工厂领导他们唱歌，以后就不见去了。
    歌曲的创作也十分贫乏。工人们感到关于工人的歌曲创作太少了，像“咱们工人有力量”一类歌曲，近年来就几乎没有了。工人中流行的是一些“妇女自由歌”“白毛女”电影中的“秋收”等歌。这些歌曲不是依靠歌咏组织推广的，而是有个别同志会唱，一些人跟着学会了的；或听唱片学会的。一九五零年间，天津市工人中有不少的音乐创作，得奖的工人就有九个。而一九五一年年底，天津市总工会文教部总结工作时，只有棉纺二厂工人韩瑞祥送来了三篇歌曲创作。韩瑞祥在创作上很苦闷，迫切希望得到专业音乐工作者的帮助，但他却找不到机会。他曾写过歌曲寄给天津市文联，而天津市文联过了半年才把稿子退给他。他又曾写了一个歌剧寄给天津日报，过了两个月天津日报才回信说该稿已转给中央音乐学院，但中央音乐学院至今尚未处理。
    天津市是个有五十多万工人的工业城市，天津市的音乐工作者听任工人音乐活动陷于停顿、自流，天津市音乐工作者协会是应负主要责任的。中华全国音乐工作者协会对天津市音乐工作者协会缺乏思想领导，也应负责。音乐工作者脱离工人群众，忽视工人群众音乐运动的错误是严重的，希望迅速纠正这种错误，切实执行毛主席的文艺方针，使文艺为工农兵服务，在城市首先应为工人群众服务。
