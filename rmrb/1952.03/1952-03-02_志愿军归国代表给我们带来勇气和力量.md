    Volunteer Army Returning Delegates Bring Us Courage and Strength
    Dang Min
    The Northwest Sub-group of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegate Group, and the Northwest Sub-group of the Korean People's Delegation to China, comprising eleven representatives including Zhang Zifang and Kim Jang-seok, arrived in Weinan, Shaanxi from Xi'an City on the evening of the 13th. On the 15th, after the delegates gave vivid reports on the victories on the Korean front and the heroic deeds of the Chinese and Korean soldiers fighting for the people, they further aroused the cadres present's high regard for the Volunteer Army, and also further aroused their hatred for the corrupt and thieving elements who stole the people's property. That evening, most organs at the Weinan Special District level held meetings and carried out intense anti-corruption struggles. Many people, after listening to the reports, voluntarily confessed their problems and actively denounced others. Four people even wrote letters to the representatives on the spot during the Volunteer Army Returning Delegates' reports, expressing their intention to confess their problems clearly to the leadership. Lei Kuanhou, manager of the Weinan branch of Xinhua Bookstore, said in his letter to the representatives: "After listening to your reports, I am truly ashamed and have nowhere to hide. Your reports have given me courage and strength. I guarantee to confess the facts of my embezzlement of public funds before 12 o'clock tonight after listening to the report." After the cadres of the Public Security Department of the Commissioner's Office returned from listening to the report, they immediately held an anti-corruption meeting without even eating dinner, starting from 9:00 PM and continuing until dawn. The masses' emotions were very enthusiastic. Due to the strong firepower, the corrupt element Xue Yingjie also confessed to embezzling 2,000 jin of public grain. After listening to the report, the cadres of the Weinan Special District Office of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative proposed: to use the spirit of anti-tank hero Wang Yongzhang in fighting tanks to launch a fierce struggle against the corrupt elements in our organization. He Shao-kui, an employee of this office, also conducted a review in conjunction with his own thoughts, not only confessing his own corruption facts but also denouncing Gao Zhanxiang and two others who were corrupting with him. Wang Guangzu, a personnel section cadre of the Special District Trading Company, and Tong Yimin, an administrator, also voluntarily confessed their crimes of extortion and bribery. In the special district level alone, eleven people have successively voluntarily confessed and been denounced.
    The effect of the delegation's report in Weinan fully proves that the publicity of front-line victories and heroic model deeds plays a great role in educating the people and promoting the current anti-corruption struggle.

    志愿军归国代表给我们带来勇气和力量
    党民
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团西北分团、朝鲜人民访华代表团西北分团代表张子芳、金长石等十一人，十三日晚从西安市来到了陕西渭南。十五日，代表们生动地报告了朝鲜前线的胜利和中朝部队战士为人民而英勇作战的事迹以后，更加激起了到会干部对志愿军的高度热爱，也更加激起了对偷盗人民财产的贪污盗窃分子的痛恨。这一天晚上，渭南专区一级大多数机关都召开会议，进行了紧张的反贪污斗争。有许多人听了报告以后，自动交代了自己的问题，并积极检举了别人。还有四个人是在志愿军归国代表报告的时候，当场就给代表写信，表示要向领导方面交代清楚自己的问题。新华书店渭南支店经理雷宽厚给代表的信中说：“听了你们的报告，我真惭愧得无地自容。你们的报告给我增加了勇气，增加了力量。我保证听完报告后，在今晚十二点钟以前交代清我自己贪污公款的事实。”专署公安处的干部听报告回来以后，没顾得吃饭，马上就开反贪污的会，从下午九点钟开始，一直开到天明，群众情绪非常热烈。由于火力旺盛，贪污分子薛英杰又坦白出贪污两千斤公粮的事实。省供销社渭南专区办事处的干部听了报告以后提出：要用反坦克英雄王永章打坦克的精神，向本机关的贪污分子进行猛烈斗争。这个办事处的职员何少魁并结合自己的思想作了检讨，不但交代了自己的贪污事实，并且检举了和他一起贪污的高占祥等三人。专区贸易公司人事科干事王光祖、管理员同益民也自动坦白了自己的敲诈和受贿的罪行。光专区一级几个单位，先后自动坦白和被检举的就有十一个人。
    代表团在渭南报告所收到的效果，充分证明前线胜利和英雄模范事迹的宣传，在教育人民和推动当前反贪污斗争上有很大作用。
