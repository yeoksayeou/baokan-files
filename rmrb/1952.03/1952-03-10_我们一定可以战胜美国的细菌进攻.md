    We Will Surely Defeat the American Bacterial Offensive
    Qian Sanqiang, Director of the Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    Recently, American imperialism has used the most brutal bacteriological warfare in the world, something that even Hitler and Mussolini dared not do. This proves that American imperialism cannot withstand our heroic and invincible Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the battlefield and is unscrupulously and cruelly slaughtering the people of China and Korea, attempting to prolong and expand the war of aggression against Korea.
    This monstrous crime of American imperialism will not only fail to frighten the heroic people of China and Korea, but will instead arouse their irreconcilable anger and hatred. How many times have the weapons that American imperialism thought it could rely on the battlefield been defeated by the heroic fighters and people of China and Korea. This time, bacteriological weapons will also be defeated. Our medical, health, and biological science workers have already organized to participate in the anti-bacterial warfare. Now, thousands more young scientific workers are demanding to join the battle. I believe that our nation's scientific workers and the entire nation's military and civilians, united under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, comprehensively organized, will certainly defeat this bacteriological offensive of American imperialism in the front and in the rear, and can guarantee victory against any other new offensives it may launch in the future.
    Justice is on our side, we will surely win!

    我们一定可以战胜美国的细菌进攻
    中国科学院近代物理研究所所长  钱三强
    最近，美国帝国主义使用了世界上最残暴的、希特勒和墨索里尼尚不敢为的细菌战。这证明了美国帝国主义在战场上抵抗不住我们英勇无敌的朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军，不择手段地来残暴虐杀中朝两国人民，企图延长和扩大侵朝战争。
    美国帝国主义的这一滔天大罪，不但吓不倒英勇的中朝两国人民，相反地更激起了中朝两国人民的不共戴天的愤怒和仇恨。已经有多少次美国帝国主义自以为可恃的战场上的武器统统在中朝两国的英勇战士和人民的奋斗下遭到失败，这次细菌武器亦将同样地被打倒。我国的医药、卫生、生物科学工作者已经组织起来前往参加反细菌战的工作，现在更有成千的青年科学工作者要求参加战斗任务。我相信我们全国科学工作者和全国军民结合起来，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下全面地组织起来，在前方和后方一定可击破这次美帝国主义的细菌进攻，并且可以保证对将来它的任何其他的新进攻获得胜利。
    正义属于我们，我们一定获得胜利！
