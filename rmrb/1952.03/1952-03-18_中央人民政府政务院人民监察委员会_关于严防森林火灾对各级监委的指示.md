The existing forest reserves in our country are far from sufficient to meet the needs of national economic construction. Since the liberation of the whole country, governments at all levels have attached importance to forest protection work and have led the masses to achieve certain results in forest protection and afforestation. However, the phenomena of illegal logging and indiscriminate felling are still widespread in various places. In particular, the spread of mountain fires has caused extremely serious damage to forests. The basic reason for this is that the leading cadres in these places do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of forest protection and fire prevention work. They have neither resolutely implemented the forest protection policies, nor have they conscientiously implemented the forest protection policies among the masses. Some cadres even mistakenly put forest protection and fire prevention work in opposition to agricultural production work, or, proceeding from a one-sided mass viewpoint, encourage the masses to burn mountains at will, resulting in continuous mountain fires every spring. In order to implement the "Instructions on Strictly Preventing Forest Fires" issued by the Government Administration Council on March 4, the following instructions are hereby given:

I. The People's Supervision Commissions of the Great Administrative Areas and Provinces should regard the inspection of the arrangements and implementation of forest protection and fire prevention work by local people's governments at all levels as one of their important tasks, and should supervise the lower-level supervision committees to conduct inspections at any time.

II. Supervision committees at all levels in and near mountainous areas should, during the seasons when mountain fires are prone to occur each year, conduct key inspections of the local people's governments' forest protection and fire prevention work in conjunction with relevant agencies, and conduct inspections in a timely manner after mountain fires occur.

III. Supervision committees at all levels in and near mountainous areas should supervise the local people's governments to conscientiously mobilize and organize the masses to carry out forest protection and fire prevention work in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council; those who set fires to mountains or engage in other ways to destroy mountain forests should be punished according to law; those who are active and successful in forest protection and fire prevention work should be commended or rewarded.

IV. Supervision committees at all levels in and near mountainous areas should, in conjunction with agricultural and forestry agencies and local governments, select farmers, women, young people, and employees of agricultural and forestry agencies who have demonstrated initiative in forest protection and fire prevention work as supervisory correspondents to strengthen the people's supervision work in forest areas.

V. Supervision committees at all levels should conscientiously study the instructions of the Government Administration Council and all other relevant policies, laws, and regulations, and invite responsible persons from agricultural and forestry agencies to report on local forest conditions and various matters related to forest protection and fire prevention in order to strengthen business learning.

It is hoped that supervision committees at all levels will conscientiously implement the above instructions and report the implementation status to this commission at any time.

    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会
    关于严防森林火灾对各级监委的指示
    我国现有森林之积蓄量，远不足供应国家经济建设之需要。自全国解放以来，各级人民政府虽重视森林保护工作，并领导群众在护林、造林方面收到一定的成绩；但各地盗伐、滥伐现象仍普遍地存在，尤其是山火蔓延对森林的损失，更是十分严重。其基本原因是这些地方领导干部对于护林防火工作的重要性认识不足，既没有坚决执行护林政策，也没有认真把护林政策贯彻到群众中去，甚至有些干部错误地把护林防火工作与农业生产工作对立起来，或者从片面地群众观点出发，鼓励群众随便烧山，以致每年春季不断发生山火燎原的事故。兹为贯彻执行三月四日政务院“关于严防森林火灾的指示”，特作如下指示：
    一、各大行政区及省人民监察委员会应将检查各级地方人民政府对护林防火工作的布置及执行情况作为重要工作之一，并随时督促下级监委进行检查。
    二、山区及山区附近的各级监委，应于每年容易发生山火的季节，会同有关机关，对当地人民政府的护林防火工作，进行重点检查，并于山林火灾发生后及时进行检查。
    三、山区及山区附近的各级监委，应监督当地人民政府遵照政务院指示，认真发动并组织群众进行护林防火工作；对于放火烧山或以其他方式进行破坏山林者，依法予以惩处；对护林防火工作积极而有成绩者，应予以表扬或奖励。
    四、山区及山区附近的各级监委，应会同农林机关及当地政府选聘在护林防火工作中表现积极的农民、妇女、青年及农林机关的职工为监察通讯员，以加强森林区域的人民监察工作。
    五、各级监委应认真学习政务院的指示及其他一切有关的政策法令，并邀请农林机关负责人报告当地森林情况，及有关护林防火的各种事项以加强业务学习。
    以上指示，希各级监委认真执行，并将执行情况随时层报本委。
    主任　谭平山
    一九五二年三月十七日
