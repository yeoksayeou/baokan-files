Xinhua News Agency, London, March 24th: TASS reports: The Sino-British Friendship Association issued a statement protesting the crimes of the American aggressors in conducting germ warfare in Korea and China. The statement said, "Even Hitler had not stooped to this level."

The Sino-British Friendship Association's statement pointed out that the U.S. government does not conceal its activities in preparing for germ warfare and recounts that when the head of the British Germ Warfare Research Department, Henderson, visited the United States last year, he personally witnessed large-scale U.S. preparations for germ warfare. Moreover, Japanese specialists who are proficient in this brutal method of warfare and who used Chinese prisoners of war to experiment with bacteriological weapons during the Second World War, are also colluding with the United States to jointly carry out these preparations. The U.S. government is one of the only few governments in the world that has refused to ratify the Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological weapons.

The statement emphasized: "Given all these facts, it is no wonder that the U.S. government can only issue deceptive denials that can fool no one."

The Sino-British Friendship Association's statement called on the British people to loudly protest to prevent the United States from bringing disaster to the world.

The statement concluded: The British people must force the British government to take steps to stop the germ warfare being carried out by the American aggressors.

    英中友协号召英国人民
    制止美国进行细菌战
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十四日讯：英中友好协会发表声明，抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行。声明说：“即使希特勒也还没有堕落到这种地步。”
    英中友协的声明指出美国政府并不掩饰自己准备细菌战的活动，并追述说：英国细菌战研究处处长亨得逊去年访问美国的时候，曾亲眼看到美国大规模准备细菌战的活动。不但如此，曾在第二次世界大战期间用中国战俘试验细菌武器，精通这种残暴的作战方法的日本专门人员们，也正在和美国狼狈为奸地勾结在一起，共同进行这种准备工作。美国政府是世界上拒绝批准禁止细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的仅有的几个政府之一。
    声明着重指出：“既然如此，无怪乎美国政府在这一切事实面前，就只能发表骗不过任何人的掩耳盗铃的否认声明了。”
    英中友协的声明号召英国人民大声疾呼地提出抗议，防止美国给世界招来灾难。
    声明最后说：英国人民必须迫使英国政府采取步骤，制止美国侵略者所进行的细菌战。
