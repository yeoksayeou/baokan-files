Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions from the People's Daily

    Author of "A Treatise on Brewing" Responds to Readers' Criticism of the Book

    To the Editor:
    The "Reader's Letters" column in the People's Daily on March 19th published a letter from a reader criticizing me for praising American imperialism's research on germ warfare in my book "A Treatise on Brewing." This criticism is entirely correct. In the first half of 1949, the Commercial Press planned to republish "A Treatise on Brewing," and I was asked to supplement it with new material. At that time, because it was shortly after liberation, my understanding was vague, and I casually took an article from the July 1947 issue of the American journal Industrial & Engineering Chemistry, "The Fermentation Industry in World War II," and adopted it as material. After being pointed out by the reader, I felt deeply moved. I have now notified the Commercial Press to delete this passage. In the future, I will excavate my own erroneous thoughts and thoroughly correct my past mistakes.

    “酿造学分论”作者对读者批评该书的答复
    编辑同志：三月十九日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了读者批评我在“酿造学分论”一书中颂扬了美帝国主义研究细菌战的来信。这个批评是完全正确的。一九四九年上半年，商务印书馆拟将“酿造学分论”再版发行，由我补充新材料。当时我因解放不久，认识模糊，随便取美国一九四七年七月份工业与工程化学杂志中的“第二次大战中发酵工业”一文，采为材料。经读者指出后，我有很深的感动。现在我已通知商务印书馆将这一段删去。今后我当挖掘自己的错误思想，痛改前非。
