Party Life

	Editor's Note: In the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement, Party propaganda workers and speakers should use the specific materials that have been exposed regarding the rampant attacks of illegal capitalists on the state and the people to conduct class education for the working class and the laboring people. This is one of the basic methods for raising the consciousness of the working class and encouraging their fighting will. The experience of the Southern District Committee of Shenyang City in propaganda work can be used as a reference for other regions.

    In the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement, the speakers and propaganda workers of the Southern District Party Committee of Shenyang City mobilized various propaganda forces to carry out propaganda work, which promoted the advancement of the movement. The six speakers in the entire Southern District made nearly twenty reports in twenty days. More than eight hundred propaganda workers each made more than two oral propaganda speeches. They also used literacy teachers to conduct more than two propaganda sessions in one hundred and seventy residents' literacy groups (with more than three thousand students). Under the promotion of propaganda workers, two hundred and fifty-one street reading groups (with more than 20,000 participants) generally managed to read the newspaper three times a week. Around the Spring Festival, students from the street mass night schools formed nine propaganda brigades (sixty people in each brigade) and performed short plays such as "Which Road Are You Taking?", "Wang Desheng's Confession," "Can't Buy It," and "Denunciation" many times, mainly in the form of Yangko dance. Before each performance, propaganda workers would publicize the significance of the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement to the audience. The district cultural center, workers' club, and street propaganda stations also carried out activities around this movement. In addition, the Southern District Office of the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Southern District Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Southern District Women's Federation, under the unified leadership of the Southern District Committee of the Communist Party of China, held representative meetings to explain the policies. More than a thousand middle school students in the Southern District also carried out general propaganda in streets and industries. In this way, more than half of the population of the entire district received education. The general public had a preliminary understanding of the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle and began to take action. In ten days, residents of 14th Weilu Street alone reported or secretly accused capitalists of more than 380 illegal incidents.

    In addition to the general propaganda work mentioned above, the Southern District inspection work teams themselves were also propaganda work teams. They conducted relatively in-depth class education for workers and the masses in key industries, creating educational methods such as "Reunion Meetings" and "Reasoning and Denunciation Meetings," educating workers and staff through typical cases of capitalists illegally seizing profits. Before accounting, the workers of Baohe Iron Factory did not understand how much illegal profit the capitalists had made. After initial exposure and detailed accounting, it was found that the illegal capitalists had made a profit of more than 2 billion RMB. This made the workers and staff specifically recognize the ugliness of the illegal capitalists. In the process of inspection, the Southern District also carried out communist education for the workers. For example, the work team at the Baohe Iron Factory focused on explaining the following questions: First, why is the working class the leading class; Second, pointing out that communist society is the most fulfilling society for mankind, explaining that the future of the working class is bright and promising; Third, the current task of the working class is to counterattack the rampant illegal capitalists. Experience has proved that in places where this kind of education has been carried out, the workers' fighting spirit is particularly high.

    However, there are still some shortcomings in the propaganda work of the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement in the Southern District. The basic shortcoming is that the propaganda work lags behind the development of the movement, the momentum is not strong, and it has not reached the requirement of "making a big splash." For example, in most industries, the workers and masses have not been fully mobilized. Among some workers, there is still the idea that "it's better to do less than more," they are unwilling to report, and they fantasize that illegal capitalists will confess themselves; some workers worry that "the capitalists will find fault" after the report, so they lack courage and confidence. The thinking of grassroots trade union cadres is also quite chaotic, and some have put forward inappropriate slogans. Street propaganda has a generalized phenomenon, and the forms of propaganda are also rigid. Therefore, many residents of the streets do not understand the policies of the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement. The above situation shows that to mobilize the masses in a deep and broad way, it is necessary to further carry out propaganda work.

    The shortcomings of the propaganda work in the Southern District are caused by the following reasons: The Southern District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shenyang City has not grasped the leadership, timely inspection, and summarization, and has not better organized the propaganda forces of various parties. In the past stage, the propaganda department of the district committee did not have a main cadre in charge of the leadership, and therefore lacked specific and effective guidance on the propaganda work of the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement.

    Propaganda work is an indispensable link in carrying out the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle. The leading organs of the Party organization must plan in a unified way and, within a certain period, put forward clear propaganda content and slogans in a timely manner according to the progress of the movement, and better organize various propaganda forces to closely integrate propaganda work with the actual movement. After the work is arranged, it is necessary to conduct regular inspections, correct deviations, and summarize experiences. Therefore, in the future, the Southern District Committee of Shenyang City should, in specific work: First, be good at mastering and using the strength of the inspection work teams, and educate the comrades of each work team to realize that they are not only work teams, but also propaganda teams, that is to say, not only to expose the dark and decadent aspects of the bourgeoisie, but also to continuously improve the class consciousness of workers and the masses ideologically and politically in the process of the movement. To this end, while arranging inspection tasks, it is also necessary to instruct propaganda content and methods, and to summarize and promote the experience of struggle in a timely manner. Regularly hold certain meetings in a planned way to focus on carrying out class education and policy education for the comrades of the work team. Second, it is necessary to grasp the leadership of speakers and propaganda workers. Some of them have participated in the work team, and this favorable condition should be used to strengthen their ideological leadership, solve their doubts and difficulties, and provide them with propaganda materials, so that they can truly play the backbone role of propaganda and education in this movement. In addition, attention should be paid to cultivating activists who emerge in the movement. They are also a group of propaganda forces that should be relied on. The district committee should vigorously strengthen their education through mass organizations in the form of training classes, so that they can play a greater role. Third, make full use of the propaganda forces and propaganda tools of the entire district, and create more vivid and lively propaganda forms (such as shouting stations, radio stations, picture windows, etc.), so that the significance of the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement is known to every household. In this way, it is possible to make corruption offenders and thieves nowhere to hide.

### 沈阳市南市区党组织在反贪污、反盗窃斗争中的宣传工作

    沈阳市南市区党组织在反贪污、反盗窃斗争中的宣传工作
    编者按：在反贪污、反盗窃运动中，党组织的宣传员、报告员应当运用已经揭发出来的关于违法资本家对国家和人民猖狂进攻的具体材料，向工人阶级和劳动人民进行阶级教育，这是提高工人阶级觉悟，鼓舞他们的斗争意志的基本方法之一。沈阳市南市区委会的宣传工作经验可供各地参考。
    在反贪污、反盗窃运动中，沈阳市南市区党委会的报告员和宣传员动员各种宣传力量进行了宣传工作，推动了运动的前进。全南市区的六名报告员，在二十天内做了将近二十次报告。八百多名宣传员每人都做了两次以上的口头宣传。他们又通过识字教师，在一百七十个居民识字组（有三千多学员）中进行了两次以上的宣传。在宣传员的推动下，二百五十一个街道读报组（有二万多人参加），一般地做到了每周读报三次。春节前后，街道群众夜校的学员组成九个宣传大队（每队六十人）以秧歌为主，演出“你走那条路”、“王德生坦白”、“买不动”、“检举”等短剧多次。在每次演出之前，都由宣传员向观众宣传反贪污、反盗窃运动的意义。区文化馆、职工俱乐部、街道宣传站也都围绕着这个运动进行了活动。另外，沈阳市总工会南市区办事处、青年团南市区委会、区民主妇女联合会在中共南市区委会统一领导下，分别召开了代表会议，讲解了政策。南市区的千余中学生也在街道行业中进行了一般的宣传。这样，全市区半数以上的人口受到了教育。一般群众对反贪污、反盗窃斗争有了初步认识，并开始行动起来。在十天当中，仅十四纬路街居民，就检举或密告资本家违法事件三百八十多件。
    南市区除进行了上述一般的宣传工作之外，市区检查工作组本身也就是宣传工作组，他们在重点行业里对职工群众进行了比较深入的阶级教育。创造了“团圆会”“说理检举会”等教育方法，通过清算资本家违法攫取利润的典型事例来教育工人和职员。宝合铁工厂在未算账前，工人不了解资本家到底牟取了多少违法利润，经过初步揭发和细算，就查出违法资本家牟取暴利达人民币二十亿元以上。使工人和职员具体地认识了违法资本家的丑恶。南市区在进行检查工作中，同时向职工进行了共产主义教育。如工作组在宝合铁工厂曾着重讲解了下述问题：第一、为什么说工人阶级是领导阶级；第二、指出共产主义社会是人类最美满的社会，说明工人阶级的前途是光明远大的；第三、工人阶级的当前任务，就是向着猖狂进攻的违法资本家进行反攻。经验证明，凡是经过这种教育的地方，工人斗争情绪格外高涨。
    但是，南市区的反贪污、反盗窃运动的宣传工作，还存在着一些缺点。基本的缺点是宣传工作落后于运动的发展，声势不大，没有达到“大张旗鼓”的要求。例如：在多数行业里，职工群众尚未充分发动起来。在一部分职工当中仍存在着“多一事不如少一事”的思想，他们不愿意检举，幻想违法资本家自己坦白；有的工人顾虑检举之后，“资本家就要找别扭”，因而勇气和信心不足。基层工会干部的思想也相当混乱，有的提出不适当的口号。街道宣传有一般化的现象，宣传形式也呆板。因此街道居民中，不少人对反贪污、反盗窃运动的政策不摸底。上述情况，说明了要深入广泛地发动群众，还需要进一步开展宣传工作。
    南市区宣传工作的缺点，是由于下述原因造成的：中共沈阳市南市区委还没有抓紧领导，及时检查、总结，更好地组织各方面的宣传力量。过去这一个阶段，区委宣传部没有主要干部负责领导，因而对反贪污、反盗窃运动的宣传工作，也就缺乏具体有力的指导。
    宣传工作是开展反贪污、反盗窃斗争的不可缺少的一环。党组织的领导机关一定要统一筹划，在一定时期内，根据运动进展的情况，及时提出明确的宣传内容和口号，把各种宣传力量更好地组织起来，使宣传工作和实际运动紧密结合。工作布置之后，要定期检查，纠正偏向，总结经验。因此，今后沈阳市南市区委在具体工作方面应该：第一、要善于掌握和运用检查工作组的力量，教育每个工作组同志，要认识到他们不仅是工作队，同时也是宣传队，就是说，不仅要揭露资产阶级的黑暗腐朽方面，同时要在运动过程中，从思想上、政治上不断提高职工群众的阶级觉悟。为此，在布置检查任务同时，也要指示宣传内容和方法，及时总结推广斗争经验。有计划地经常召开一定的会议，抓紧对工作组同志进行阶级教育和政策教育。第二、要抓紧对报告员和宣传员的领导。他们有的参加了工作组，应该抓紧这个有利条件加强对他们的思想领导，解决他们的疑难问题，供给他们宣传材料，使他们在这一运动中，真正发挥宣传教育工作的骨干作用。另外，要注意培养运动中涌现出来的积极分子。他们也是一批应该倚靠的宣传力量，区委应该通过群众团体以训练班等形式大力加强对他们的教育，使之发挥更大的作用。第三、充分运用全区的宣传力量和宣传工具，创造更多的生动活泼的宣传形式（如喊话站、广播站、画片橱窗等等），以便使反贪污、反盗窃运动的意义家喻户晓。如此，才有可能使贪污犯和盗窃犯无处躲藏。
