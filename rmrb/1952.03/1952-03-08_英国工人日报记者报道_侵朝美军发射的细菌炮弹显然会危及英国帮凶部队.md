Xinhua News Agency, 7th: London Worker's Daily reporter Alan Winnington reports from Panmunjom: The U.S. side is firing bacterial bombs at the front lines not far from here. On February 26th, on the front line of the Imjin River northwest of Yeoncheon, the U.S. Third Division first fired smoke shells with artillery, and then fired six shells containing insects that spread bacteria -- flies and spiders. This area is quite close to the positions of the British Commonwealth Division, which obviously also endangers their lives. Because germs have no nationality, birds and rats can quickly carry bacteria over. The consequences of the germ warfare launched by the U.S. side cannot be predicted; germs may spread north or south. The U.S. side's extremely irresponsible attitude must be stopped before this matter becomes uncontrollable.

    侵朝美军发射的细菌炮弹显然会危及英国帮凶部队
    【新华社七日讯】伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿自板门店报道：美方正以细菌炮弹向离此不远的防线发射。二月二十六日在涟川西北临津江前线上，美军第三师先以大炮放射烟幕弹，接着就发射六枚炮弹，这些炮弹带有传布细菌的昆虫——苍蝇和蜘蛛。这个地区离英国联邦师的阵地相当近，这显然也会危及他们的生命。因为病菌是没有民族感的，飞鸟和老鼠可以很快地把细菌带过去。美方所发动的细菌战的结果是不能预言的，病菌可能向北方也可能向南方传播。在此事变得不可收拾以前，必须制止美方极不负责任的态度。
