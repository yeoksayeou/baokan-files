    Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot Administrative Side
    Review of Bureaucratic Work Style and Improvement Efforts
    To the Editor: We sincerely accept the criticism from readers of the People's Daily regarding our bureaucratic work style. The Class A Inspection Team in our factory experienced very serious overtime work in October of last year. We only focused on completing the task and did not consider the workers' health. As a result, the more overtime we worked, the more rework there was, and the more difficult it became to complete the production tasks. We also didn't value conservation, nor did we try to improve the quality of the locomotives or the operating skills of the crew. Consequently, in just eleven months of last year, we wasted more than ninety-six tons of locomotive coal.
    Now we have recognized our mistakes. With the help of higher authorities, we have convened meetings both inside and outside the Party, conducted self-criticism, and encouraged the masses to boldly offer opinions to the leadership. At the crew accident discussion meetings, we examined the losses caused to the state due to our bureaucratic practices. Based on the specific circumstances, we decided to implement a cross-operation method in the repair teams to eliminate overtime work. The administrative and trade union departments have also clearly divided their responsibilities. The trade union further mobilizes employees to improve work efficiency, the administrative side strengthens the planning of production work, strengthens the mass viewpoint, relies on the masses to complete tasks, and strictly prohibits overtime work. Starting from December 29th, we also equipped the fourteen locomotives of the contracted crew groups with a four-shift system, overcoming the shortcomings of excessively long working hours for the contracted crew groups.

    石家庄机务段行政方面
    检讨官僚主义作风改进工作
    编辑同志：我们诚恳地接受人民日报读者对我们的官僚主义作风的批评。我们工厂甲检组在去年十月份加班加点的现象很严重，我们只要求完成任务，不考虑工人的健康。结果加班加点越多，返工活也越多，生产任务越完不成。我们也不重视节约，不想法提高机车质量和乘务员的操纵技术，结果，仅机煤一项，在去年十一个月里就浪费了九十六吨多。
    现在我们已经认识了自己的错误。在上级的帮助下，我们召开了党内外的会议，作了检讨，并要求群众大胆地向领导方面提意见。我们在乘务员的事故讨论会上，检查了因官僚主义给国家所造成的损失。根据具体情况，我们决定包修组实行交叉作业法，以消灭加班加点现象。行政和工会也明确分了工。工会进一步动员职工提高工作效率，行政方面加强生产工作的计划性，加强群众观点，依靠群众完成任务，严禁加班加点。从十二月二十九日起，我们并把包乘组的十四台机车配备成四班包乘制，克服了包乘组乘务时间过长的缺点。
