    The entire team of the Beijing Anti-U.S. and Aid-Korea Volunteer Surgical Team said in their letter: "While we were on our way back to China, when we heard the news of the U.S. bandits spreading germs, we immediately signed our names collectively, requesting to join the epidemic prevention team and go to Korea again. Now we are in Beijing. We once again collectively sign our names to request that the relevant leading departments give us the earliest opportunity to go to Korea to participate in the struggle to crush the U.S. bandits' shameless conspiracy."

A reader's letter reported: "The Peking Union Medical College has launched a registration campaign to participate in the work of eliminating germs. As of March 8th, 479 people have registered to participate."

All the female employees and all the female students of Huabei Middle School and its affiliated elementary school wrote in their letters:
