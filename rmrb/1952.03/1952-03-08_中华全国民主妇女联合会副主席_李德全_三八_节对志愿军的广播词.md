Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Broadcasts to the Chinese People's Volunteers on International Women's Day

Heroic comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

As we warmly celebrate International Women's Day on March 8th, allow me, on behalf of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and the women and children of the motherland, to extend our warmest greetings and most heartfelt regards to you.

Dear comrades! You have bravely shouldered the great trust of the people of the motherland and gone to the Korean front to defend the security of the motherland, the independence and freedom of Korea, and the lasting peace of the world for more than a year. In this year, you have fiercely struck at American imperialism, achieved great victories, always maintained and promoted the glorious traditions of the People's Army, and adhered to the iron discipline of the excellent People's forces. When you take up guns to deal with the enemy, you are heroic fighters who are merciless towards the enemy, but when you treat the working people, you are humble and faithful servants of the people. For more than a year, you have not only defended every inch of the glorious land of Korea with your lives, but also used selfless labor to help the Korean people rebuild their homes. We firmly believe that a people's army with such noble patriotism and internationalism is invincible and will surely win the final victory.

I would also like to pay tribute to all the female comrades in the Volunteer Army! Dear sisters! You have overcome all kinds of difficulties, persevered in your work, and made contributions. You are forever the pride and glory of the women of the motherland, and your indomitable fighting will will forever be a brilliant example for the women of the motherland.

When we learned of the inhuman act of American imperialism spreading bacteria in the Korean front and rear, our anger was indescribable. American imperialism has inherited the atrocities of the Japanese and German fascists, and intensified its efforts to slaughter peace-loving people. They are destined to fail and will be severely punished by the people of the world.

As we warmly celebrate this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day, we swear to further enhance our political awareness from the great struggle currently underway in the motherland, work hard to increase production, practice strict economy, actively participate in the construction of the motherland, and continue to work hard to support you. We will also call on parents and women all over the world who love peace and care for children to unite more closely, jointly defend world peace, stop wars of aggression, and severely punish the masterminds who use germ warfare and kill peaceful residents.

Dear comrades! Let us shout: Long live the glorious Chinese People's Volunteers! Long live the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea! Long live our wise leader Chairman Mao! Victory belongs to the defenders of peace!

    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席
    李德全“三八”节对志愿军的广播词英雄的中国人民志愿军同志们：
    在我们热烈纪念“三八”国际妇女节的时候。让我代表中华全国民主妇女联合会和祖国的妇女们、儿童们，向你们致最热烈的敬礼和最亲切的慰问。
    亲爱的同志们！你们英勇地肩负起祖国人民的重托，去到朝鲜前线保卫祖国的安全，保卫朝鲜的独立、自由，保卫世界的持久和平，已经一年多了。在这一年多中，你们狠狠地打击了美帝国主义，获得了伟大的胜利，始终保持了并发扬了人民军队的光荣传统和坚守了优秀的人民部队的铁的纪律。你们拿起枪来对付敌人的时候，你们对敌人是毫不容情的英勇战士，当你们对待劳动人民的时候，你们却是谦虚而忠实的人民勤务员。一年多来，你们不仅用自己的生命保卫着朝鲜每一寸光荣的土地，而且用无私的劳动帮助朝鲜人民重建自己的家园。我们坚信：具有如此崇高的爱国主义和国际主义精神的人民军队，是无敌的，是一定会获得最后胜利的。
    我更要向志愿军中全体女同志致敬！亲爱的姊妹们！你们克服了种种困难，坚持了工作，立下了功劳，你们永远是祖国妇女的骄傲和光荣，你们坚忍不拔的战斗意志，永远成为祖国妇女的光辉榜样。
    当我们得知美帝国主义在朝鲜前线和后方施放细菌的绝灭人性的行为之后，我们的愤怒是无法形容的。美帝国主义继承日本、德国法西斯的暴行，并变本加厉地来屠杀爱好和平的人民，他们是注定要失败的，要受到全世界人民的严厉制裁的。
    在我们热烈地纪念今年的“三八”国际妇女节的时候，我们宣誓：要从祖国当前进行的伟大斗争中，更加提高我们的政治觉悟，努力增加生产，厉行节约，积极参加祖国的建设和继续努力支援你们。我们并将号召全世界爱好和平、爱护儿童的父母们、妇女们，更紧密地团结起来，共同保卫世界和平，制止侵略战争，并对使用细菌作战、杀害和平居民的疯狂行为的主谋者给以严厉制裁。
    亲爱的同志们！让我们高呼：光荣的中国人民志愿军万岁！抗美援朝胜利万岁！我们英明的领袖毛主席万岁！胜利属于和平的保卫者！
