    Forever Be the "Most Beloved People"
    —A Record of Volunteer Army Veterans at the Western Sichuan Veterans' School
    By Pei Guang, Representative of Returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    We went to a place near Chengdu to visit our old comrades at the Western Sichuan Veterans' School. This is a scenic ancient temple, one of the famous sights of western Sichuan. The Western Sichuan Administrative Office built this school here, including dormitories, clinics, treatment rooms, bathrooms, libraries, and dining halls, to provide a good environment for the disabled veterans of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to study and recuperate.
    When we arrived, the comrades had already lined up on both sides of the road to welcome us. They were all strong and happy. Almost every comrade said to us with great enthusiasm: "Although our bodies are disabled, our minds are not. We must strive to win victories on the production front and the learning battlefield." Many comrades requested to return to the front lines. Students in the Second Squad of the Second Team told us that comrades who previously could not read a single character could write simple letters and drafts after two or three months of study. The comrades with lighter disabilities also used the spare time from their studies to plant more than thirty mu of rapeseed and eighteen or nineteen mu of vegetable gardens. When we visited the vegetable garden, we saw their lush and large green vegetables. Some students with only one leg or one arm were also working in the fields or carrying water. We asked them what they wanted, and they said, "We don't want anything, we only ask you to tell the comrades at the front to avenge us."
    At the Veterans' School, we met eighteen-year-old female comrade Zhang Daohua. During the Fifth Battle, she was shot in both eyes by American devils' rifles while rescuing the wounded. During her convalescence in the hospital, she still insisted on studying, groping to write. When she first grabbed the pen, her hand shook violently, and after writing three characters, her brain felt like it was being pricked with needles, and she immediately fainted. But she was not disappointed. She thought of Paul Kochakin, who worked and studied tirelessly even when suffering from a serious illness. So she mustered her courage again, endured the stinging pain in her eye membranes and nerves, and tried to write again. Two months later, she was already able to write letters and write wall newspaper drafts. Inspired by her active learning, many wounded soldiers became even more enthusiastic about learning. A wounded soldier who had lost all ten fingers saw Zhang Daohua studying so diligently, so he tied a pen to his palm to practice writing. Some comrades with disabled hands and feet learned to write with their left hands or two arms.
    When we left, the students reluctantly saw us off, repeatedly urging us: "Take our hearts back to Korea and tell our comrades: We will never fail to live up to your expectations and will always be the 'most beloved people.'"

    永远做“最可爱的人”
    ——记川西荣军学校的志愿军休养员
    中国人民志愿军归国代表  裴光
    我们曾到成都附近的某地去慰问川西荣军学校的老战友。这是一个风景优美的古寺，是川西名胜之一。川西行署为了使志愿军残废军人有学习和休养的好环境，在这里修建了这所学校，包括宿舍、医务所、疗养室、浴室、图书馆和饭厅。
    我们去的时候，同志们已整队在公路两旁欢迎。他们都很健壮、愉快。每一个同志几乎都是这样热情地对我们说：“虽然我们的身体残废，但我们的思想没有残废，我们还要争取在生产战线和学习战场上打胜仗。”许多同志要求重返前线。二队二班的学员告诉我们：过去一个字也不识的同志，经过两三个月的学习，简单的信件和稿子都能写了。残废稍轻的同志们，还利用学习的空隙种了三十几亩菜子和十八九亩菜园。我们参观菜园时，看到他们的葱绿肥大的青菜。有些只有一条腿、一支胳膊的学员，也在地里生产或担水。我们问他们有什么要求，他们说：“没有什么要求，只要求你们告诉前方同志，为我们报仇。”
    在荣军学校，我们曾会见十八岁的女同志张道华。她在五次战役中因为抢救伤员，被美国鬼子的步枪打伤了两只眼睛。在病院休养中，她仍然坚持学习，摸索着写字。第一次抓笔时，她的手直抖，写了三个字，脑子也像针扎一样，马上晕倒了。但她并不失望，她想到保尔柯察金患着重病，还不倦地工作、学习。于是她又鼓起勇气，忍着眼膜和神经的刺痛，再试探着写。两个月后，她已经能够写信和写墙报稿了。在她积极学习的鼓舞下，许多伤员的学习热情更高了。一个被炸断十个手指的伤员，看见张道华这样苦心地学习，也把钢笔绑在自己的手掌上练习写字。一些手脚残废的同志，学着用左手或两个胳膊写字。
    我们离开时，学员们依依不舍地欢送我们，再三叮嘱我们：“把我们的心带回朝鲜去，告诉战友们：我们决不辜负你们对我们的期望，永远做‘最可爱的人’。”
