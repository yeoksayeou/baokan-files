Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: The Chinese delegation to the International Economic Conference to be held in Moscow on April 3rd, led by head of delegation Nan Hanchen, departed Beijing by train for Moscow on the morning of the 18th. Those who went to the station to see them off included: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression; Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Director of the Preparatory Office of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce; Huang Yanpei, Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council; Yao Yilin, Deputy Minister of Trade; Qian Zhiguang, Deputy Minister of Textile Industry; Ji Fang, Deputy Minister of Communications; Tao Menghe, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Ma Yinchu, President of Peking University; Dong Yueqian, Director of the International Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Guan Xuewen, Director of the General Office of the People's Bank of China; and more than 100 representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations.

A farewell meeting was held at the station, with Guo Moruo delivering a farewell speech. He wished the International Economic Conference success and the Chinese delegation a triumphant return.

Subsequently, the head of the delegation, Nan Hanchen, delivered a reply, saying: The International Economic Conference will be held in Moscow on April 3rd. The purpose of the International Economic Conference is to promote the development of economic cooperation among nations under conditions of world peace. Currently, the Soviet Union, China, and the various People's Democratic countries are engaged in peaceful economic construction, and the people's living standards have been steadily improving. However, some countries are pursuing arms expansion and war preparations, as well as implementing blockades and embargoes, which have made the economic crises in these countries even more serious, with increasing difficulties for industry and commerce, and a decline in the people's living standards. We believe that only by developing international economic cooperation under conditions of world peace can we promote the development of industry and commerce in various countries and improve the people's living standards, while also making world peace more consolidated. The Chinese people have always supported world peace and friendly cooperation among the peoples of all countries. The Chinese people have experienced decades of war damage and deeply feel the economic harm caused by war. The Central People's Government has achieved brilliant achievements in economic construction in the two years since its establishment. We deeply desire to develop international economic cooperation under conditions of world peace in order to promote the development of industrial and agricultural production in various countries and improve the people's living standards. We warmly support the convening of the International Economic Conference and have organized a delegation to participate in the conference in order to actively promote the development of economic cooperation relations among nations.

The Chinese delegation is willing to extensively exchange views with industrialists, businesspeople, agriculturalists, trade union workers, cooperative workers, and economists from various countries at the International Economic Conference. At the same time, we are prepared to conduct various trade negotiations with industrialists and businesspeople from various countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, with the hope of signing various trade contracts, agreements, and protocols. We are also willing to establish friendly contacts with attendees from various countries and adopt various means to establish and develop economic and friendly cooperation relations between the Chinese people and the peoples of various countries.

    【新华社十八日讯】我国参加四月三日在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议的代表团，由南汉宸团长率领，在十八日上午搭火车离北京赴莫斯科。前往车站送行的有：中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席、中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会筹备处主任陈叔通，政务院副总理黄炎培、贸易部副部长姚依林、纺织工业部副部长钱之光、交通部副部长季方、中国科学院副院长陶孟和、北京大学校长马寅初、外交部国际司司长董越千、中国人民银行办公厅主任关学文，以及各民主党派和人民团体代表一百多人。

    中国代表团愿意在国际经济会议中与各国的工业家、商业家、农业家、工会工作者、合作社工作者、经济学者等，广泛交换意见。同时我们准备与各国的工商业家在平等互利的基础上进行各种贸易谈判，以期能够签订各种交易合同、协定、协议。同时我们愿意与各国出席人建立友好的联系，采取各种方式，以建立与发展中国人民与各国人民之间的经济友好合作关系。
