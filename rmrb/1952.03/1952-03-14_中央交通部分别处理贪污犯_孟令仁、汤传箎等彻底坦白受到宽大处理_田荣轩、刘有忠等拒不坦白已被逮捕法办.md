    [Our Newspaper] The Central People's Government Ministry of Communications Savings Inspection Committee convened an anti-corruption confession and denunciation meeting on March 10 for more than 3,000 cadres from all departments of the Ministry of Communications. It announced lenient treatment for corrupt elements who thoroughly confessed and were able to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. Corrupt elements who refused to confess, after being denounced by the masses, have been arrested by judicial organs and will be severely punished according to the law. At the meeting, corrupt elements first made confessions, and then representatives from various departments expressed their opinions on how to handle the cases. A total of eight corrupt officials received lenient treatment. Among them was Zuo Lincheng (assistant engineer) of the Highway Bureau, a major corrupt official who had consistently engaged in corruption. He had a complete set of corrupt methods in contracting for repairs. Since joining the revolutionary work in 1949, he had embezzled a total of over 142 million RMB. Because of his embezzlement and bribery, unscrupulous merchants embezzled 1.1 billion RMB in public funds in engineering projects. When the anti-corruption movement began, Zuo was working in the Transportation Department of the Logistics Department of the Northeast Military Region. At that time, Zuo believed that his corruption methods were clever and would not be discovered; therefore, he refused to confess, attempting to muddle through; and he formed a "united front" with unscrupulous merchants Wan Daren and Gao Yongfang to resist together. His wife, Liu Danyi, wrote to him many times, urging him to confess properly, but he did not listen. When Liu Danyi wanted to report him, he only confessed to 20 million RMB, still not addressing the major issues. In early February, when the Ministry of Communications Savings Inspection Committee sent people to the Northeast to urge him to confess, he still believed that others would not fully grasp the materials about him, and he only planned to confess to embezzling 50 million RMB. Later, seeing that the higher authorities were very determined and the investigation was very strict, and his wife repeatedly wrote letters to persuade him, he honestly confessed to the problem and reported the corrupt elements he knew and the unscrupulous merchants who stole state property, recovering some of the state's losses. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications Savings Inspection Committee decided to request the government to give Zuo a lighter sentence and a suspended sentence. Corrupt officials who were declared exempt from criminal punishment on the spot included Meng Lingren, Tang Chuanchi, Gao Junshan, Shi Qingya, Xu Huayuan, Wu Changlin, Shen Henian, and others. These corrupt elements confessed relatively thoroughly. Meng Lingren's father was a counter-revolutionary element who was executed by the People's Government in the 1951 Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign, and all of his property was confiscated. Meng Lingren not only did not help the government register enemy property but also took the opportunity to hide five cars and some furniture that should have been handed over to the public. In the anti-corruption movement, through the enlightenment and education of the leadership and the active struggle of the broad masses, he has confessed clearly.
    After being denounced by the masses, the judicial organs arrested corrupt officials Tian Rongxuan, Liu Youzhong, Liu Jusheng, Zhang Yulin, and others on the spot at the meeting. Tian Rongxuan was the former deputy head of the supply section of the Materials Department of the China Communications Construction Enterprise Company under the former Ministry of Communications. When he went to Shanghai to purchase transportation construction equipment, he colluded with unscrupulous merchants such as Pan Baocai of the Far East Iron and Steel Company to steal a large amount of state assets. According to the materials that have now been found, Tian embezzled more than 160 million RMB, causing the state to lose more than 3 billion RMB. When the anti-corruption movement began, Tian made careful arrangements among unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai to resist the movement. After returning to Beijing, despite the patient persuasion of many people, he still tried to cover up his corrupt behavior and refused to confess; and he hired someone for 3 million RMB to send letters to unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai (this was not realized because the leading comrades discovered it). Later, although Tian admitted some of the facts of embezzlement in the face of ironclad evidence, he later overturned his confession and still refuses to confess. Therefore, the Savings Inspection Committee decided to punish him severely. Liu Youzhong, the former director of the Materials Department of the China Communications Construction Enterprise Corporation, embezzled and accepted bribes totaling more than 28 million RMB. When the company discovered Tian Rongxuan's crime of colluding with unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai to steal state property, it sent Liu Youzhong to Shanghai to investigate. After Liu went to Shanghai, he was dragged into the water by Tian and unscrupulous merchants through shameless means such as feasting, giving gifts, and using "honey traps." After he returned to Beijing, he deceived his superiors, saying: "There is no problem with Tian Rongxuan; it is just rumors spread by others." Liu also secretly notified Tian of the materials reported by others about Tian, allowing them to continue to resist the movement. He also formed a "united front" with Tian, secretly held meetings, and threatened other corrupt elements not to confess. When the company handed over Tian's case to him for handling (he was the leader of the inspection team at the time), he also said: "There is no specific material; how can I force people?" When the company's Savings Inspection Committee branch asked the Materials Department under his leadership to carry out the anti-corruption struggle, he also used the excuse of "being busy with work," saying things like "the Ministry of Communications has disrupted the company's plans," to evade the movement. When the masses rose up to report his corruption crimes, he carried out shameless threats. The Savings Inspection Committee decided to deal with him severely based on these circumstances.
    At the end of the meeting, Minister Zhang Bojun spoke. He reiterated the People's Government's policy on handling corrupt officials. He said: As long as corrupt elements can honestly confess their problems and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, the People's Government will definitely give them lenient treatment. On the contrary, whoever commits a crime and refuses to confess, even if the amount of their embezzlement is not very large, will be severely punished. He warned the corrupt officials sitting in the meeting who had not yet confessed: "Now, you still have a glimmer of hope; if you don't confess properly, this glimmer of hope will be gone." He called on all the people present to continue their efforts to besiege those corrupt elements who refuse to confess.

    中央交通部分别处理贪污犯
    孟令仁、汤传箎等彻底坦白受到宽大处理
    田荣轩、刘有忠等拒不坦白已被逮捕法办
    【本报讯】中央人民政府交通部节约检查委员会在三月十日召开了交通部各部门全体干部三千多人的反贪污的坦白检举大会。对彻底坦白并能立功赎罪的贪污分子宣布从轻处理。拒不坦白的贪污分子，经过群众检举，已由司法机关逮捕，将依法严惩。大会首先由贪污分子进行坦白，后由各部门代表发表处理的意见。从宽处理的贪污犯共八名。其中，公路总局大贪污犯左林丞（帮工程师），一贯贪污。他在包修工程中有一整套的贪污办法，从一九四九年参加革命工作以来，先后共贪污人民币一亿四千二百多万元。由于他贪污受贿，奸商在工程中盗窃公款十一亿元。反贪污运动开始时，左犯正在东北军区后勤部运输部工作。当时，左犯认为贪污方法巧妙，不会被发现；因此拒不坦白，企图混过去；并且和奸商宛达人、高永芳订立“攻守同盟”，共同进行抗拒。他的妻子刘丹宜多次写信要他好好坦白，他也不听。刘丹宜要检举他时，他只坦白了二千万元，大问题仍不交代。二月上旬，交通部节约检查委员会派人到东北促他交代时，他仍然认为别人不会完全掌握他的材料，只准备交代贪污五千万元。后来看到上级决心很大，调查得很严厉，自己的妻子也一再写信劝告，这才老老实实地交代了问题，并检举了他所知道的贪污分子和盗窃国家财富的奸商，挽回了国家的一部分损失。因此，交通部节约检查委员会决定要求政府对左犯从轻判刑，并缓期执行。当场宣布免予刑事处分的贪污分子有孟令仁、汤传箎、高俊山、史清亚、徐华源、吴昌林、沈鹤年等七名。这些贪污分子都是坦白比较彻底的。孟令仁的父亲是反革命分子，在一九五一年镇压反革命运动中，被人民政府处决，并宣布没收他的全部财产。孟令仁不但没有帮助政府登记敌产，却趁机把应缴公的五部汽车和一部分家具隐蔽起来。在反贪污运动中，经过领导方面的启发、教育和广大群众的积极斗争，他已交代清楚。
    经过群众检举，在大会上当场由司法机关逮捕的贪污犯有田荣轩、刘有忠、刘聚生、章玉林等四人。田荣轩是前交通部中国交通建设企业公司材料部供应课副课长。他在到上海采购交通建设器材的时候，和远东钢铁公司奸商潘宝才等互相勾结，大量盗窃国家资财。据现在已查出的材料，田犯贪污一亿六千多万元，使国家损失三十多亿元。反贪污运动开始时，田犯便在上海奸商中作了周密的布置，抗拒运动。回北京后，虽经许多人耐心劝导，他对自己的贪污行为仍多方掩盖，拒不坦白；并以三百万元雇人给上海奸商送信（此事因领导同志发觉，未能实现）。后来，田犯虽然在铁的证据面前承认了一部分贪污事实，但以后又自己推翻了供词，至今仍然拒不坦白。因此节约检查委员会决定从严惩处。前任中国交通部建设企业总公司材料部主任刘有忠，总共贪污受贿二千八百多万元。公司发现田荣轩在上海勾结奸商、盗窃国家财产的罪行时，曾派刘有忠到上海去调查。刘犯到上海后，就被田犯和奸商以请客、送礼、美人计等无耻手段拖下水去。他回北京后欺骗上级说：“田荣轩没有问题，是别人造的谣言。”刘犯还把别人检举田犯的材料，秘密通知田犯，使他们继续抗拒运动。他并且和田犯订立“攻守同盟”，秘密召开会议，威胁其他贪污分子，不许坦白。当公司把田犯的案件交给他处理时（当时他任检查组长），他还说：“没有具体材料，叫我逼人家吗？”公司节约检查委员会分会要他领导下的材料部进行反贪污斗争时，他也藉口“工作忙”，说什么“交通部把公司的计划打乱了”等，来逃避运动。群众起来检举他的贪污罪行时，他又进行无耻的威胁。节约检查委员会根据这些情节，所以也决定对他从严处理。
    会议最后由章伯钧部长讲话。他重新说明了人民政府对贪污犯处理的政策。他说：只要贪污分子们能够老老实实地交代问题，立功赎罪，人民政府一定对他们宽大处理。相反地，谁如果犯了罪而又拒不坦白，就算他们贪污数字不很大，也要受到严厉惩处。他对坐在会场上至今还没有坦白的贪污分子提出警告说：“现在，你们还有一线生路；如果你们再不好好坦白，这一线生路也没有了。”他号召到会的全体人员继续努力围攻那些拒不坦白的贪污分子。
