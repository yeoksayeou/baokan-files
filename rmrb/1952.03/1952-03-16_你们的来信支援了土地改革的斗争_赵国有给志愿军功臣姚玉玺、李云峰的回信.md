    Your Letters Support the Struggle of Land Reform
    ——Zhao Guoyou's Reply to Volunteer Army Heroes Yao Yuxi and Li Yunfeng

    Dear Volunteer Army First-Class Heroes Yao Yuxi and Li Yunfeng:

    I am currently participating in land reform work in Leiyang, Hunan. As I was fighting fiercely against the landlord class together with my peasant brothers, I received your letter to Ma Hengchang, Hao Jianxiu, Li Yong, Tian Guiying, Li Shunda, Qu Yaoli, and me. Your letter is truly like an army supporting the land reform struggle. I tore open the envelope on the "front line" and read it aloud to the peasant brothers. Everyone listened intently. It felt as if we were on a certain high ground southwest of Kimhwa in Korea, watching you, Comrade Yao Yuxi, lead a squad, defending the position, repelling the enemy's three-pronged attack, which increased from a company to a battalion, and a surprise attack. Over a hundred American devils were killed or wounded in front of the position. At this moment, the peasant brothers shouted, "Fight! Kill one more American devil, and there will be one less man-eating wolf." I continued to read about Comrade Li Yunfeng leading a machine gun team fighting for five days and nights, staying on the front line despite being wounded, braving the heavy rain to persevere until the victorious completion of the mission. The peasant brothers all jumped up. They pointed to the letter with their strong fingers and said, "Where did our fruits of liberation come from! We will never forget the Volunteer Army, and we will never forget their parents and wives!" When distributing land, houses, and other fruits of victory, it was always "military families first, then ourselves." After the land reform was completed, everyone wrote into the patriotic pact: Do a good job in preferential treatment, cultivate the land on behalf of others meticulously, add fertilizer and work hard to ensure a bumper harvest. Dear comrades, the people of the motherland attribute today's happy life to you - the meritorious Volunteer Army comrades.

    Your letter also encouraged me. I want to learn from your spirit of heroic struggle. At present, I am determined to contribute all my strength and work with the peasant brothers to completely defeat the landlord class and greet your victory with even greater victories. I am willing to start a patriotic emulation with you on different fronts.

    Wishing you
    Good health and continued progress!
    Zhao Guoyou March 3rd

    你们的来信支援了土地改革的斗争
    ——赵国有给志愿军功臣姚玉玺、李云峰的回信亲爱的志愿军一等功臣姚玉玺、李云峰同志：
    我正在湖南耒阳参加土地改革工作。当我正和农民兄弟们一道对地主阶级作激烈斗争的时候，接到了你们写给马恒昌、郝建秀、李永、田桂英、李顺达、曲耀离和我的信。你们的信，真像支援土地改革斗争的一支军队。我在“火线”上当场撕开信皮，向农民兄弟们宣读。大家都聚精会神地听着。我们好像到了朝鲜金化西南的某高地，看着你——姚玉玺同志带领一个班，守卫在阵地上，打退了敌人从一个连增加到一个营兵力的三路进攻和一次偷袭，阵地前面摆着一百多个被打死、打伤的美国鬼子。这时，农民兄弟们高喊起来了：“打！多打死一个美国鬼子，就少一个吃人的狼。”我继续宣读了李云峰同志带一个机枪组战斗五昼夜，受了伤不下火线，冒着大雨一直支持到胜利完成任务的英勇事迹。农民兄弟都蹦起来了。他们用粗壮的手指指着这封信说：“我们的翻身果实那里来的啊！我们忘不了志愿军，忘不了他们的父母妻子！”大家在分田地、房屋和其他胜利果实的时候，都是“先军属，后自己”。土地改革结束后，大家都在爱国公约里订出：做好优抚工作，代耕土地要精耕细作，加工加肥，保证丰收。亲爱的同志，祖国人民都把自己今天的幸福生活归功于你们——劳苦功高的志愿军同志们。
    你们的来信也鼓励了我。我要学习你们英勇斗争的精神。目前，我决心贡献自己的全部力量，和农民兄弟一道，彻底打垮地主阶级，以更大的胜利来迎接你们的胜利。我愿意和你们在不同的战线上展开爱国主义竞赛。祝你们
    身体健康，努力前进！
