Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 27th: The fourth campaign of the anti-corruption struggle in the first-level organs of the Northwest Region concluded victoriously on the 22nd, after ten days of fighting. This campaign, armed with the "Several Regulations of the Central Commission for Economy and Thrift Inspection Regarding the Handling of Embezzlement, Waste, and Overcoming Bureaucratic Errors," launched a fierce attack on major embezzlers while dealing with general embezzlers.

In this campaign, many units, at public sentencing rallies held by temporary people's courts, relied on materials obtained from investigations and studies, and under the surging emotions of mass struggle, reasoned and contended with embezzlers, achieving significant results. At the sentencing rallies, those who confessed thoroughly and showed remorse were given lenient treatment on the spot according to the law; those who were seriously involved, had conclusive evidence, and refused to confess were arrested on the spot and severely punished. This kind of rally, which embodied policy with vivid facts and created a momentum of both leniency and strictness, coupled with the persuasion of various groups during the breaks in the rallies, caused many major embezzlers who had tried to get away with their crimes to waver. Many of them confessed their embezzlement facts and sought the prospect of leniency through confession. Many embezzlers who had embezzled less than ten million yuan also confessed or continued to confess their embezzlement issues to the rally. At a recent sentencing rally held by the Xi'an Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, the number of major embezzlers who voluntarily confessed and were exposed accounted for one-third of the total number of major embezzlers exposed in the previous three campaigns.

In units where the embezzlers have been basically identified, this stage is combined with the "returning stolen goods and washing away filth" movement to settle cases for embezzlers based on the principle of seeking truth from facts. At present, the total amount of stolen money recovered by some advanced units has reached 40 to 50 percent. The work of settling cases is carried out on the basis of clarifying the issue of stolen money. The work of settling cases in each unit is first proposed by the embezzlers themselves, then discussed democratically, and approved by the leadership; cases of embezzlement involving more than ten million yuan are handled after being sentenced by a temporary people's court. At the rallies for returning stolen goods, settling cases, or handling problems, many embezzlers and those who had committed embezzlement errors and occasionally stumbled, voluntarily made plans to redeem themselves with meritorious service.

After the fourth campaign, due to the different business nature, number of people, and progress of the struggle in each unit, they will, under the unified leadership of the Northwest Region First-Level Organ Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee, formulate plans for further carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle in their respective units according to their own situations and progress, in order to achieve a complete victory in the struggle.

    西北一级机关处理贪污分子收到很大效果
    各单位将分别制定计划进一步贯彻反贪污斗争
    【新华社西安二十七日电】西北区一级机关反贪污斗争的第四个战役，经过十天的战斗，已在二十二日胜利结束。这个战役是以“中央节约检查委员会关于处理贪污、浪费及克服官僚主义错误的若干规定”这一文件为武器，一面处理一般贪污分子，一面向大贪污犯展开了猛烈的进攻。
    在这一战役中，许多单位在临时人民法庭所举行的宣判大会上，依据调查研究所得的材料，在高涨的群众斗争情绪下，向贪污分子斗理斗智，收到了很大的效果。在宣判大会上，对于坦白彻底并有悔过表现者，当场依法从轻处理；对于情节严重、证据确凿而抗不坦白者，就当场依法逮捕，从严惩处。这种以活的事实体现政策和有宽有压的大会声势，加上大会间隙时各个小组的规劝，使许多曾经企图侥幸混赖过去的大贪污分子发生动摇，有许多人俯首坦白了自己的贪污事实，争取坦白从轻的前途。许多贪污千万元以下的贪污分子也纷纷向大会坦白或继续坦白了自己的贪污问题。郑州铁路管理局西安分局在最近举行的一次宣判大会上，自动坦白和被检举出的大贪污分子就占前三个战役揭发出来的大贪污分子总数的三分之一。
    在贪污分子已经基本搞清的单位，这一阶段就结合“退赃洗污”运动，依据实事求是的原则，给贪污分子定案。现在部分先进单位追回贪污分子的赃款总数已达百分之四十至五十。定案工作是在搞清赃款问题的基础上进行的。各单位的定案工作，都先由贪污分子自己提出草案，民主讨论，领导批准；贪污千万元以上的贪污案件，经过临时人民法庭宣判处理。在退赃、定案或处理问题的大会上，许多贪污分子和犯有贪污错误、偶尔失足的分子，纷纷自动定出立功赎罪计划。
    各单位因业务性质、人数多寡和斗争进度的不同，第四个战役结束后，将在西北区一级机关增产节约委员会的统一领导下，按照各自的情况和进度，定出本单位进一步开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的计划，以求得斗争的彻底胜利。
