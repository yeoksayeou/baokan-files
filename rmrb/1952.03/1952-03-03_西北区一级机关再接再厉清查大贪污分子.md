    Xinhua News Agency Report: Having accepted the experience from the first campaign of encircling and suppressing major embezzlers, all level one organs in the Northwest District, on the basis of continuing to mobilize and educate the masses, have universally organized "shock brigades" consisting of investigation, accounting, problem research, and policy propaganda. Many major embezzlers who were "sent in" and "pulled over" by the bourgeoisie only surrendered after their cunning tricks repeatedly failed. For example, Guo Lvkai, a major embezzler in the Northwest Petroleum Administration, was a "mole" sent in by the bourgeoisie. When he was struggled against, he tried every means to deny the charges, even "guaranteeing with his life" and writing a "letter of guarantee" to resist confession. The leadership of the bureau organized several investigation teams and uncovered materials about his "secret pact of offense and defense" with Sun Liangchen, a profiteer in Lanzhou. Only then could Guo not deny it and admitted to the criminal fact of directly embezzling more than 400 million yuan.
    In order to give thoroughly confessing major embezzlers the opportunity to atone for their crimes, many organs have, under leadership and with a purpose, designated certain major embezzlers who have thoroughly confessed to participate in seminars on certain cases, asking them to conduct research based on their own experience and put forward opinions. This method has achieved great results.
    Many departments also held "anti-corruption struggle conferences" in the second campaign; based on the severity of the embezzlers' crimes and the situation of their confessions, and after review and approval by the superior frugality inspection committee, a group was exempted from punishment, a group was given lenient treatment, and individual embezzlers who stubbornly refused to confess were arrested by relevant departments according to law, so that embezzlers could recognize the policy of the People's Government of leniency for those who confess and severity for those who resist from specific examples. This has played a powerful role in promoting the anti-corruption movement.
    Some advanced units, on the basis of continuing to overcome right-leaning thoughts, have already noticed the importance of thoroughly recovering stolen goods and clarifying problems for continuing to carry out the anti-corruption movement and consolidating existing achievements.

    西北区一级机关再接再厉清查大贪污分子
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：接受第一个战役中围剿大贪污犯的经验，西北区一级各机关在继续发动和教育群众的基础上，都普遍组织了以调查、算账、研究问题和宣传政策等为内容的“突击队”，许多被资产阶级“派进来”、“拉过去”的大贪污分子，都是在他们的狡猾伎俩接连失败的情况下才束手就擒的。例如西北石油管理局大贪污犯郭履凯，是资产阶级派进来的“坐探”，他在被斗争时百般狡赖，曾“以生命作担保”，写下“保证书”，抗拒坦白。该局领导方面就组织了几个调查队，查获了他和兰州奸商孙良忱订立“攻守密约”的材料，这样，郭犯才抵赖不过，承认了直接贪污四亿多元的罪恶事实。
    为了给予彻底坦白了的大贪污分子以立功赎罪的机会，许多机关有领导、有目的地指定某些已坦白彻底的大贪污分子参加某一案件的座谈会，要他们根据自己的经验进行研究，提出意见，这个方法收到很大效果。
    许多部门在第二个战役中还举行了“反贪污斗争大会”；根据贪污分子的罪恶轻重和坦白情形，经上级节约检查委员会审查和批准，免予处分一批，从轻处理一批，对个别坚不坦白的贪污分子则由有关部门依法逮捕，使贪污分子从具体的实例中认识到人民政府对坦白者从宽、顽抗者从严的政策。这对反贪污运动起了有力的推动作用。
    有些先进单位，在继续克服右倾思想的基础上，已注意到彻底追赃、搞清问题对于继续开展反贪污运动和巩固已有成绩的重要性。
