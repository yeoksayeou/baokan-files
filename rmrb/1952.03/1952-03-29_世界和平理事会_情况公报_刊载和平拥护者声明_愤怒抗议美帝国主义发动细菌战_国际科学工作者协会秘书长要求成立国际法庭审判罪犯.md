Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 28th: The World Peace Council's "Situation Bulletin" continues to publish letters and statements from peace supporters around the world, angrily protesting the American aggressors' germ warfare.

The famous peace fighter and American singer Paul Robeson wrote to the World Peace Council, expressing support for the World Peace Council's declaration. He wrote: The heinous crimes committed by American imperialism against the heroic Korean and Chinese people will surely arouse the anger of all honest people against the American military leaders and the decision-makers of this policy of exterminating humanity. The well-documented news of the U.S. military's germ warfare has shocked and shamed millions of peace-loving Americans, and prompted them to launch strong protests immediately. He said: "I condemn with extreme vehemence the mass slaughter planned by these fellows who have long oppressed black people and colonial peoples, as well as the working masses in our country and in other countries. The struggle to ban atomic and bacteriological warfare must be carried out to the end without respite, forcing the warmongers and possible warmongers to accept such measures."

The famous American progressive writer Howard Fast said: "This war horror is beyond words. The world's peace forces will denounce it, and when our people are fully informed of the facts, they will also denounce it. The struggle for peace is more important than ever before."

The famous Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén said in a letter: "The war of aggression commanded by Ridgway was already abhorrent, but using insects, bacilli, and other invisible deadly bacteria to wage war against heroes who defend their homeland with blood and flesh is an even more heinous crime. For the safety of the people of the world (including the American people), this crime must be stopped quickly and mercilessly."

Dr. Hewlett Johnson, Dean of Canterbury, said that the United States itself has admitted to having made all preparations for conducting germ warfare. He said: "This weapon is abominable in the eyes of the British people and those who believe in Christian doctrine."

The "Situation Bulletin" also published protests from peace supporters in Germany, Poland, India, Italy, Algeria, and Cyprus, as well as protests from the Australian Wharf Labourers' Union, the Building Workers' Industrial Union, the Sheet Metal Workers' Union, and trade unions in many other countries.

Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: The All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies received a copy of a letter from J.G. Crowther, Secretary-General of the International Association of Scientific Workers, to Jean Laffitte, Secretary-General of the World Peace Council, regarding the issue of the United States conducting germ warfare. The full text of the letter is as follows: Dear Friend:

The letter of March 3rd and the enclosed statement by Mr. Guo Moruo regarding the United States' use of bacteriological weapons in Korea have been received.

The news of the United States military's use of bacteriological weapons in Korea is shocking.

Now that the Americans have actually committed these despicable crimes, it is clearly not enough for the World Peace Council to simply submit suggestions to the United Nations for consideration; it should demand an immediate end to these crimes and the establishment of an international tribunal to try those responsible criminals.

In addition, I hope that the World Peace Council and its affiliated national peace committees will launch considerable protests against this new war crime. National peace committees should appeal to all relevant bodies in their countries, especially academies of sciences and medical bodies, calling on them to protest to their national governments against the use of these criminal weapons.

In those countries whose governments have troops under the command of the American headquarters in Korea, the respective national peace committees should demand that their governments withdraw from this barbarous attack on civilization by the United States and demand that their troops be withdrawn to their own countries immediately.

Please convey to Mr. Guo Moruo my boundless anger at this new atrocity committed by the United States against the Korean people and the Korean-Chinese People's Army, and express my sympathy to the Korean people; I firmly believe that their struggle for freedom and justice, supported by their Chinese brothers and sisters and by all honest men and women around the world, will surely achieve final victory.

    世界和平理事会“情况公报”刊载和平拥护者声明
    愤怒抗议美帝国主义发动细菌战
    国际科学工作者协会秘书长要求成立国际法庭审判罪犯
    【新华社布拉格二十八日电】世界和平理事会出版的“情况公报”继续发表全世界和平拥护者愤怒地抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战的书信和声明。
    著名和平战士、美国歌唱家罗伯逊写信给世界和平理事会，表示支持世界和平理事会的宣言。他写道：美帝国主义对英勇的朝鲜人民和中国人民所犯的万恶不赦的罪行，一定会激起全体正直人类对美国军事首脑和这一大批消灭人类的政策的决策人的愤怒。美国军方发动细菌战这一有据可考的消息，使千百万爱好和平的美国人感到震惊与可耻，并推动他们立即提出强烈的抗议。他说：“我极端强烈地谴责这些长期压迫黑人与殖民地人民以及我国与各国劳动群众的家伙们所策划的大批屠杀。必须毫不停歇地将禁止原子战与细菌战的斗争进行到底，迫使战争制造者与可能的战争制造者接受这种措施。”
    著名美国进步作家法斯特说：“这种战争恐怖是言语难以形容的。全世界的和平力量都会痛斥它，当我国人民充分获悉事实以后，也会要痛斥它。争取和平的斗争比以前已更加重要了。”
    古巴名诗人吉里安在来信中说：“李奇微所指挥的侵略战争本已令人憎恶，而用昆虫、杆状菌和其他看不见的致命细菌来对用血肉保卫自己祖国的英雄们进行战争，则更是一个罪恶滔天的罪行，为了世界人民（包括美国人民在内）的安全，必须赶快毫不容情地制止这种罪行。”
    坎特伯雷副主教约翰逊博士说：美国自己已经承认为进行细菌战作过一切准备工作，他说：“在英国人民以及信奉基督教义的人看来，这种武器是可憎的。”
    “情况公报”还刊载了德国、波兰、印度、意大利、阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯的和平拥护者的抗议，以及澳大利亚码头工人工会、建筑工人工会、金属板工人工会以及其他许多国家的工会提出的抗议。
    【新华社二十八日讯】中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会收到国际科学工作者协会秘书长克劳瑟寄来的他就美国进行细菌战问题致世界和平理事会秘书长拉斐德的信的副本一件，该信全文如下：亲爱的朋友：
    三月三日的来信以及附寄来的郭沫若先生关于美国在朝鲜使用细菌武器的声明，都已收到。
    美国军队在朝鲜使用细菌武器的消息，使人感到非常震惊。
    现在，美国人既然已经实际犯了这些卑鄙的罪行，世界和平理事会仅是把建议提交联合国考虑，显然是不够的了；它应该要求立即停止这种罪行，应该成立一个国际法庭，对那些负责的罪犯们加以审判。
    此外，我希望，世界和平理事会及其属下的各国和平委员会都对这种新的战争罪行提出相当的抗议。各国和平委员会应该向它们本国一切相当的机关、特别是科学院和医学机关呼吁，号召它们向他们本国政府抗议使用这种罪恶的武器。
    在那些政府派有军队供朝鲜美国司令部指挥的国家里，各该国和平委员会应该要求他们的政府退出美国这种对文明的野蛮攻击，并要求马上把他们的军队撤回国内。
    请转告郭沫若先生：我对于美国这种对朝鲜人民以及对朝中人民军队的新暴行感到无比的愤怒，并对朝鲜人民表示同情；我坚决地相信，他们争取自由和正义的斗争，在他们的中国兄弟姊妹的支持下，在全世界一切正直的男女的支持下，必将取得最后的胜利。
        克劳瑟    一九五二年三月九日
