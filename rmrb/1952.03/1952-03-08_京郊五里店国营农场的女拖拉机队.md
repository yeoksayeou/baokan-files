    The female tractor drivers of the Wulidian State-Run Farm in the suburbs of Beijing are driving tractors on the snow-covered fields of early spring, starting their cultivation work. To prevent drought and conserve moisture, they have begun deep plowing and fine harrowing, creating favorable conditions for increasing yield per unit area this year.
    The eighteen young female tractor drivers in this farm, along with their captain (also the deputy director) Comrade Li Zhenrong—one of the earliest three famous female tractor drivers in North China—mostly come from poor and hired peasant families in the countryside. After liberation, although they were liberated, given land and houses, and improved their lives, when they heard about fresh things such as Tian Guiying driving trains, Liang Jun driving tractors, and the happy lives of women in Soviet collective farms, they eagerly sought more suitable positions for themselves in the construction of the new China, to create a better future for the motherland. In February 1950, the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization School wanted to recruit a group of students. When they heard this news, they rushed from all over to apply for the exam regardless of everything else. When they applied for the exam, the leaders of the mechanization school said to them: "Think it over carefully! This work is very hard." But their answer was: "No hardship can compare to the hardship imposed on women in the old society." They were admitted to the mechanization school and became the first group of female students in this school, starting to learn mechanization theory and technology. During their studies, difficulties came one after another: they couldn't copy down notes, they couldn't draw mechanical charts, and they couldn't understand the principles explained by the teachers. However, they were not overwhelmed by these difficulties. They came up with many ways to overcome the difficulties in their studies: organizing mutual aid, with those who were educated teaching those who were not, and those with good technical skills teaching those with poor technical skills; sometimes they would hold books and jump on the machines, looking at the machines and learning in comparison. After studying hard like this for six months, they became initially familiar with the basic principles of the machines, and then they began to enter the internship stage. In October 1950, they were all assigned to the Wulidian State-Run Farm in the suburbs of Beijing to participate in the machine耕 team work.
    They excitedly welcomed this internship assignment. Regardless of the hot summer days or cold winter nights, they operated the machines all day long, practicing starting, turning, reversing, as well as plowing, harrowing, sowing, and harvesting, and other operating techniques. The villagers nearby looked at them and said in surprise:
    "Women can also drive machines?" They answered these villagers with facts. They worked with the male drivers, humbly learning from those with good driving skills, and practicing hard frequently. These ordinary rural girls finally became excellent female tractor drivers. Last year, they completed the task of cultivating 4,000 mu of land for the farm, increasing cotton production by more than double that of the local farmers.
    Women can not only drive machines, but also drive them very well. They used facts to educate those who used to look down on women. Now, the villagers also come to ask them for help with plowing. One day, the village chief of Sanjianfang Village near the farm came to the farm and asked the tractor drivers to help them reclaim wasteland. It turned out that Sanjianfang Village had 3,000 mu of wasteland, which had been occupied by landlords in the past, and that land had been barren for five or six years, with weeds growing as tall as a person, and the roots of the grass were tangled in the ground more than half a foot deep. The villagers originally wanted to reclaim it themselves, but they could not do anything with such a large area of wasteland with just their hoes. Several attempts at reclamation all failed. However, such a piece of wasteland, under the tractors driven by the female tractor drivers, was all reclaimed in just a few days.
    These eighteen girls, who were discriminated against and oppressed in the old society, have become advanced technical workers and backbone members participating in the construction of the motherland in just over a year under the cultivation and education of the Communist Party. The farm has pointed out the direction of agricultural collectivization to the farmers, and the female tractor drivers have opened up a new path for the vast number of rural women. (Attached picture)

    京郊五里店国营农场的女拖拉机队
    秀珍
    北京郊区五里店国营农场的女拖拉机手们，在初春积雪的原野上，驾驶着拖拉机，开始耕作了。她们为了防旱保墒，已开始深耕细耙，为今年的提高单位面积产量创造有利条件。
    这个农场里的十八个青年女拖拉机手，和她们的队长（副场长兼）李振荣同志——华北最早的三个著名女拖拉机手之一，大多来自农村贫、雇农的家庭。解放后，她们虽然翻了身，分到了土地、房屋，改善了生活，但是，当她们听到田桂英开火车、梁军开拖拉机和苏联集体农庄妇女的幸福生活等新鲜事物后，就迫切地寻找自己在新中国建设事业中更适宜的岗位，以创造祖国的美好的将来。一九五○年的二月，北京农业机耕学校要招收一批学员。她们听到这消息，便不顾一切地从各地跑来投考。在她们投考应试时，机耕学校的领导同志对她们说：“多考虑考虑吧！做这工作是很苦的。”但是她们的回答是：“什么苦，也比不上旧社会加在妇女身上的苦。”她们考进了机耕学校，成为这个学校的第一批女学员，开始学习机耕理论和技术。学习中，困难接二连三地来了：笔记抄不下来，机械图表不会画，教师讲的道理听不懂。但是，她们没有被这些困难压倒。她们想出了许多克服学习上困难的办法：组织起来互助，有文化的教没有文化的，技术好的教技术差的；有时就捧着书本跳上机器，看着机器，对照着学习。这样苦学了六个月，她们初步熟悉了机器的基本原理，于是开始进入实习阶段。一九五○年十月，她们全部被分配到京郊五里店国营农场，参加机耕队工作。
    她们兴奋地迎接着这个实习任务。她们不管在炎热的夏日，或是寒冷的冬夜，整天操纵着机器，练习发动、转弯、倒退以及耕地、耙地、播种、收割等操作技术。附近的老乡们看着她们，惊奇地说：
    “女人也能开机器？”她们用事实回答了这些老乡。她们和男驾驶员们一起工作着，虚心地向驾驶技术好的人学习，经常苦练。这些平凡的农村女孩子，终于成了优秀的女拖拉机手。去年她们完成了农场四千亩地的耕种任务，使棉花的产量比当地农民提高了一倍多。
    女人不但能开机器，并且开得很好。她们用事实教育了过去那些轻视妇女的人。现在，老乡们也来要求她们帮助耕地了。有一天，农场附近三间房村的村长，来到农场要求拖拉机手们帮助他们开荒。原来三间房村有三千亩荒地，过去在地主霸占下，那块地足足荒芜了五六年，杂草长得有一人高，草根盘结在地下足有半尺多深。老乡们原想自己动手开垦，但是单凭他们的锄头对这样大片的荒地是没有办法的。几次开垦，几次都失败了。然而，这样一块荒地，在女拖拉机手开动的拖拉机下，不几天就都开出来了。
    这十八个被旧社会歧视、压迫的女孩子，在共产党的培养和教育下，仅仅一年多时间，就成了先进的技术工人，成为参加祖国建设事业的骨干。农场给农民们指出了农业集体化的生产方向，女拖拉机手们给广大的农村妇女开辟出了新的道路。（附图片）
