    Open Robbery, Shameless Swindling
    --The Crimes of Grand Thieves Yan Ti and Zhang Wenyi, a Couple Who Colluded Internally and Externally to Steal 3.6 Billion Yuan of State Property
    In the anti-corruption movement, the Jilin Provincial People's Government arrested the grand thieves Yan Ti and Zhang Wenyi, as well as all related criminals. Yan Ti, under the guise of an illegal capitalist agent, infiltrated state organs and stole the position of Director of the Tianjin Sales Office of the Jilin Provincial Finance Department. He conspired with his wife, Zhang Wenyi, to collude internally and externally to steal state property. Later, Zhang Wenyi even infiltrated the "Production Department of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee," became acquainted with the major embezzlers Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, and implemented large-scale theft. According to available materials, the crimes of Yan and Zhang involved the theft of state property amounting to 3.6 billion yuan in Renminbi.
    Yan Ti was originally a foreman, and his wife, Zhang Wenyi, was a small merchant who "dealt in scrap." In 1946, Yan Ti wormed his way into the Jiaohe Mass Cooperative in Jilin Province, and later became the Chief of the Finance and Grain Section of the Jiaohe County People's Government. During this period, he used various despicable tricks to win over Zhou Huanan, the then County Head of Jiaohe. In March 1949, when Zhou Huanan was transferred to the Jilin Provincial People's Government as Deputy Director of the Finance Department, he transferred Yan Ti to the Finance Department and sent him to Tianjin as Chief of the Supply and Marketing Section of the Production Management Office. Later, he was changed to Director of the Tianjin Sales Office of the Jilin Provincial Finance Department.
    Only three days after Yan Ti arrived in Tianjin, Zhang Wenyi also rushed to Tianjin to do business. Yan Ti gave Zhang Wenyi priority access to all the economic intelligence he obtained. Zhang Wenyi was always the first to know what goods from Jilin's enterprises and organs were arriving in Tianjin, what varieties, and at what prices; or what equipment was being purchased from Tianjin. Yan Ti also privately lent large amounts of public funds to Zhang Wenyi for speculation and profiteering, or allowed Zhang Wenyi to deposit them in private money houses to obtain high interest rates of 17 to 30 per thousand per day. Yan Ti also touted Zhang Wenyi everywhere, turning Zhang Wenyi into a "celebrity" among Tianjin's commercial capitalists. Like flies, the profiteers swarmed around, wanting to suck up state wealth through her connections.
    One of the stores that did a lot of business with the sales office, Jianzhong Trading Company, falsely claimed a capital of 100 million yuan when it was established in April 1949, saying that it could handle imported goods and accept foreign exchange; in reality, it was an empty shell with nothing at all, just buying and selling on credit. The deputy manager of this trading company was a friend of Yan Ti, so Yan instructed Zhang Wenyi to get involved with them and engage in speculative business.
    The first deal between the two parties was that the sales office entrusted Jianzhong Trading Company to purchase 2,000 barrels of machine oil. They paid the price of a well-known brand but delivered miscellaneous brands. Moreover, the contract stipulated "payment upon completion, delivery in installments"; but they paid for 2,000 barrels and only delivered a total of 1,038 barrels in installments. In addition to using this deposit for speculation, Jianzhong Trading Company earned more than 100 million yuan at once. Even stranger was that this batch of machine oil was not transported back to Jilin but was handed over to Jianzhong Company for resale. This time, the contract became "delivery in batches, payment in installments." Jianzhong Trading Company further turned "installments" into "long-term," and only returned the money after a full year and a half. This was equivalent to the state handing over funds worth 10,000 bolts of cloth to profiteers for speculation for a long period. During this period, the sales office also handed over 1,000 tons of rice to Jianzhong Trading Company for consignment sale, also stipulating "delivery in batches, payment in installments"; again handing over funds worth approximately 10,000 bolts of cloth to profiteers, for their use for a year. After obtaining huge profits, Jianzhong Trading Company spent lavishly and bought three streamlined cars. Other merchants said, "This is all money from the Jilin Provincial Finance Department!"
    The staff of the sales office couldn't bear to watch the state's assets being arbitrarily stolen by profiteers, so they reported these situations to the Jilin Provincial Finance Department. However, Deputy Director Zhou Huanan had already been dragged into the water by Yan Ti, and he shamelessly defended Yan Ti, saying, "The Party Constitution doesn't stipulate that family members of Party members are not allowed to do business." From then on, profiteers like Zhang Wenyi looted state property even more unscrupulously. Zhang Wenyi openly lived in the sales office, and Yan Ti openly told her commercial secrets and helped her evade state taxes. Zhang Wenyi made a fortune and successively invested in three trading firms, Xin She, Yi Sheng, and Qiao Jian, and also co-founded the Tianfeng Rice Mill with a profiteer nicknamed "Old Hu the Eighth." And these "trading firms" and "rice mills" were all opened in order to do business with the sales office.
    On the other hand, Zhang Wenyi bribed extensively to obtain favorable conditions for doing business. She often treated all the staff of the sales office to banquets, the best operas, and gave them cigarettes, clothing, and so on. Those who served her particularly well were openly given money or other valuable gifts as thanks. In this way, the sales office staff were all "silenced" and publicly called her "Sister-in-law Yan." Zhang Wenyi universally gifted watches, pens, clothing, etc., to the responsible cadres. No fewer than twenty people, from section chiefs to directors of the Jilin Provincial Finance Department, accepted her bribes. She was even more "attentive" to Zhou Huanan, euphemistically called "taking care of the leader." From pens, watches, women's coats, women's raincoats, bananas, black tea, all the way to children's clothes, children's cars, toys, etc.; she even "took care" of Zhou Huanan's mother's coffin and funeral clothes.
    At the end of 1950, the sales office received an order from the Jilin Provincial People's Government to purchase some industrial raw materials—tinplate. Instead of buying it themselves, the sales office gave the money to Zhang Wenyi to buy it on their behalf. Zhang Wenyi bought it at a low price and then sold it to the sales office at a high price, and also received a commission of one percent from the sales office. When private merchants learned about this, they took the initiative to find the sales office, willing to sell to the sales office at the original price (without Zhang Wenyi's deduction), but were rejected by Yan Ti. Zhang Wenyi purchased a total of 74 tons of tinplate this time, at 9.6 million yuan per ton; with a flip of the hand, she sold it to the sales office at a high price of 13 million yuan per ton. But Yan Ti did not ship the goods back to Jilin. Three months later, Jilin urgently needed tinplate and telegraphed Yan Ti to ship the goods. At this time, the price of tinplate had risen, and Yan Ti, regardless of the urgent needs of Jilin's industrial construction, resold it to Zhang Wenyi at a price of 13.7 million yuan per ton. Yan Ti also publicized: "Zhang Wenyi has earned us tens of millions of yuan, earning us 700,000 yuan per ton of tinplate." In fact, with one flip of the hand, Zhang Wenyi sold it to the "Production Department of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee" at a price of 15 million yuan per ton. Zhang Wenyi received the money for 74 tons from the "Production Department of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee" but only delivered 40 tons of goods; she kept the remaining 34 tons herself, waiting for the price to rise. Two months later, the price of tinplate did rise. At this time, the Jilin Provincial Finance Department repeatedly urged for the goods, and Yan Ti bought the 34 tons of goods stored by Zhang Wenyi at a price of 20 million yuan per ton. In this tinplate business, the goods did not move, but Zhang Wenyi turned it over six times. Every time she turned it over, Zhang Wenyi received a commission of one percent in addition to making money on the price difference. Yan Ti also personally helped her evade state taxes. Cumulatively, this business caused a loss of more than 700 million yuan to the state. This huge sum of money completely leaked into Zhang Wenyi's private pocket.
    But Yan Ti and Zhang Wenyi were still not satisfied, and they became acquainted with the major embezzlers Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan of the Tianjin Special Area. In April 1951, Zhang Wenyi, through the connections of "Old Hu the Eighth," met the director of the "Production Department of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee." Zhang Wenyi first sent milk to the "Production Department of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee" on time and in quantity, and delivered it directly to Liu Qingshan. Over time, through the introduction of this director, Liu Qingshan met Zhang Wenyi, who in turn introduced Yan Ti to him. Yan Ti took the opportunity to expound his theory of "using commerce to support industry" and planned for Liu Qingshan, hoping that Liu Qingshan would first take a sum of money and give it to Zhang Wenyi for business, and when the profit reached a certain amount, then formally open a chemical factory. Liu Qingshan then hired Zhang Wenyi as the deputy manager of the "chemical factory" that did not even exist, and treated her with the courtesy of a distinguished guest, sending cars to pick her up and drop her off, and even built a new house for her in the farm. At this time, Liu Qingshan handed over 4.9 billion yuan to Zhang Wenyi for business.
    The first business Zhang Wenyi did with Liu Qingshan's money was to buy 8,000 bags of tax-evaded carbon paper at a price of 28,000 yuan per bag. Without moving a finger, Zhang Wenyi sold it to the "Production Department of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee" at a price of 40,000 yuan per bag. With a flip of the hand, she made a profit of 96 million yuan. Soon after, Yan Ti, in the name of the sales office, purchased 4,000 bags of carbon paper from the "Production Department of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee" through Zhang Wenyi's hands, at a price of 53,000 yuan per bag. The Jilin Provincial Finance Department spent more money, allowing Zhang Wenyi to make a great "contribution" to the "Production Department of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee." In fact, including tax evasion, she stole nearly 200 million yuan of state property this time. Zhang Wenyi used the 4.9 billion yuan from the "Production Department of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee" for speculation, causing a loss of 2.1 billion yuan to state assets.
    Yan Ti and Zhang Wenyi looted state property so unscrupulously that, in addition to spending it to their heart's content, they also accumulated a large amount of savings over the years. According to Zhang Wenyi herself, "Even if we just mess around with our family fortune, it's worth a billion. We can live a lifetime just eating the interest from the bank." In reality, it is definitely more than this amount. They hired a lot of servants at home—master chefs, old maids, cowherds—and also hired a "teacher" specifically to teach the children martial arts.
    If criminals like Yan Ti and Zhang Wenyi, whose crimes are heinous, are not thoroughly eliminated, our country's economic construction cannot proceed!

    公然的抢劫，无耻的骗夺
    ——大盗窃犯阎禔、张文义夫妇内外勾连盗窃国家财产三十六亿元的罪行
    吉林省人民政府在反贪污运动中，逮捕了大盗窃犯阎禔、张文义以及全体有关罪犯。阎禔以违法资本家代理人的身份，打进国家机关内部，窃踞吉林省财政厅驻天津推销处主任之职，和他的妻子张文义合谋，里勾外连，盗窃国家财产。后张文义更打进“天津地委生产处”，结识大贪污犯刘青山、张子善，大施盗窃手段。据已得材料：阎、张二犯前后盗窃国家财产达人民币三十六亿元之巨。
    阎禔原来是个把头，老婆张文义是个“倒腾破烂”的小商人。阎禔在一九四六年钻进吉林省蛟河大众合作社，后来竟当了蛟河县人民政府的财粮科长。在这期间，他曾用种种卑鄙伎俩，拉拢当时蛟河县长周化南。一九四九年三月周化南调吉林省人民政府任财政厅副厅长时，便把阎禔调到财政厅，派赴天津，任生产管理处供销科长。后改任吉林省财政厅驻天津推销处主任。
    阎禔到天津刚三天，张文义也赶到天津作买卖。阎禔所得到的经济情报，都尽先供给张文义。凡是吉林省的企业、机关有什么货物到天津，什么品种，什么价格；或者是由天津购买什么器材，张文义都能先知道。阎禔还把大量公款私自借给张文义做投机倒把的生意，或任张文义存入私人钱庄，获得日息千分之十七至千分之三十的高利。阎禔又到处替张文义吹嘘，使张文义变成天津商业资本家中的“风云人物”。奸商们和苍蝇一样，都围上来，想通过她的关系，吸吮国家财富。
    和推销处大做生意的商店之一——建中贸易公司在一九四九年四月成立时，伪称资金一亿元，可办出进口货物，可接外汇；实际上它是个空架子，一无所有，只是买空卖空。这个贸易公司的副经理，是阎禔的朋友，阎即派张文义和他们搞在一起，作投机生意了。
    双方的第一笔生意，是推销处托建中贸易公司代购机器油两千桶。出的是名牌货的价钱，交的却是杂牌货。并且合同上规定“成宗付款，分期交货”；但成宗付了两千桶的款，分期交货却总共只交了一千零三十八桶。建中贸易公司除拿这笔定款进行投机外，一次就赚了一亿多元。更奇怪的是：这一批机器油并没有运回吉林，而是又交给建中公司代卖。这次的合同却变成了“成批交货，分期付款”。建中贸易公司更进一步把“分期”变成了“长期”，整整拖了一年半，才还了这笔钱。这就等于国家拿价值一万匹布的资金，长期交给奸商倒把。这个时期推销处又把一千吨大米和稻子交建中贸易公司代销，同样规定了“成批交货，分期付款”；又把价值约一万匹布的资金交给了奸商，使用了一年。建中贸易公司获得暴利后，便大肆铺张，买了三辆流线型小汽车。其他商人们说：“这都是吉林省财政厅的钱！”
    推销处的工作人员不忍看着国家资财任意由奸商盗窃，便把这些情况反映到吉林省财政厅。但是副厅长周化南已经被阎禔拖下水，他竟无耻地替阎禔辩护说：“党章上也没有规定不许党员的家属作买卖。”从此，奸商张文义等更肆无忌惮地抢劫国家财产。张文义公开住在推销处，阎禔公开告诉她商业机密情报，帮她偷漏国税。张文义发了横财，先后和私商合资开办新社、怡甡、侨建三个贸易行，还和一个外号“胡八爷”的奸商合开了天丰制米厂。而这些“贸易行”、“制米厂”，都是为了和推销处做生意才开的。
    另一方面，张文义则大肆行贿，取得作生意的便利条件。她常常连续请推销处全体人员吃酒席，看最好的戏，送香烟、衣料等等给他们。对特别为她效劳的，则公开送钱或其他贵重礼物作谢。这样，推销处人员便都被她“堵住了嘴”，公称她为“阎大嫂”。张文义对负责的干部，则普遍馈送手表、钢笔、衣料等等。吉林省财政厅从科长到厅长，受她贿赂的不下二十人。她对周化南更“照顾”得无微不至，美其名曰“照顾首长”。从钢笔、手表、女人大衣、女人雨衣、香蕉、红茶，一直到小孩衣服、小孩车子、玩具等等；甚至连周化南母亲的棺材、寿衣都“照顾”好了。
    一九五零年底，推销处接到了吉林省人民政府的命令，要买一部分工业原料——马口料。推销处不自己去买，却把钱交给张文义代买。张文义以低价买来，转手就以高价卖给推销处，还得到推销处百分之一的佣金。这件事情被私商们知道了，他们主动找到推销处来，愿以原价卖给推销处（不受张文义从中克扣），但被阎禔拒绝了。张文义这一次共买了七十四吨马口料，每吨九百六十万元；转手之间，便按每吨一千三百万元的高价，卖给推销处。但阎禔并没有把货运回吉林。三个月以后，吉林需用马口料甚急，打电报叫阎禔把货运来。正在这时马口料涨了价钱，阎禔便不顾吉林工业建设上的急需，又以单价一千三百七十万元转卖给张文义。阎禔并大肆宣传：“张文义给咱们赚了好几千万元，每一吨马口料给咱们赚七十万元。”实际上张文义一倒手，便以单价一千五百万元，卖给“天津地委生产处”。张文义领到“天津地委生产处”七十四吨的钱，只交四十吨货；下余的三十四吨，她自己留下看涨。又两个月，马口料果然涨价了。这时吉林省财政厅又再三催货，阎禔又以单价二千万元，把张文义存下的三十四吨货买来。这一项马口料生意，东西不动地方，便经张文义倒了六次手。每经一次手，张文义除价钱上赚钱以外，还得到百分之一的佣金。阎禔并且亲手帮助她偷漏国税。累计起来，这一宗生意给国家造成的损失，即达七亿多元。这笔巨款完全漏入张文义私囊。
    但阎禔和张文义仍不满足，他们又结识了天津专区大贪污犯刘青山、张子善。一九五一年四月，张文义经过“胡八爷”的关系，认识了“天津地委生产处”的处长。张文义便首先按时定量给“天津地委生产处”送牛奶，并且直接送到刘青山面前。时间长了，经过这位处长的介绍，刘青山会见了张文义，又经张文义介绍认识了阎禔。阎禔借机发表其“以商养工”的论调，并为刘青山策划，希望刘青山先拿一笔钱，交张文义作生意，盈利到一定数量的时候，再正式开办化学工厂。刘青山当时就把张文义聘为连一点影子也没有的“化学工厂”的副经理，并待以上宾之礼，来往都派小汽车接送，还专在农场为她盖新房。就在这时，刘青山把四十九亿元巨款，交给张文义经商。
    张文义拿到刘青山的钱，第一笔生意，就是以二万八千元单价，买得漏税的复写纸八千袋。原封不动，张文义就按四万元单价，转卖给“天津地委生产处”。转手之间，得利九千六百万元。不久，阎禔又以推销处名义，用五万三千元单价，经张文义的手，购买“天津地委生产处”复写纸四千袋。吉林省财政厅多出了钱，让张文义为这件事情给“天津地委生产处”立了一大“功”。实际上她这次连偷税在内，盗窃国家财产将近两亿元。张文义拿“天津地委生产处”的四十九亿元作投机生意，共使国家资财损失二十一亿元。
    阎禔和张文义就是这样肆无忌惮地抢劫国家财产，几年以来，除供他们尽情挥霍外，还存有大量积蓄。据张文义自己说：“折腾折腾家底也值十个亿。存在银行里吃利，也能过一辈子。”实际上决不止这个数目。他们家里雇的用人——大师傅、老妈子、牛倌——非常多，还养了一个专门教小孩们学武术的“教师爷”。
    像阎禔、张文义这样的罪恶滔天的罪犯，如不彻底肃清，我们国家的经济建设是无法进行的！
