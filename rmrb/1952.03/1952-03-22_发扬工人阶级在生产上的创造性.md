Promoting the Creativity of the Working Class in Production

State-Owned Pingxiang Coal Mine, Shimen Steel Team:
Improving Work Methods, Creating New Tunneling Records Again

    Workers of the Shimen Steel Team of the state-owned Pingxiang Coal Mine tunneled 24.7 meters of rock roadway in one day and night on March 3rd this year, once again setting a new national record for rock roadway tunneling. The rock layer tunneled by the Shimen Steel Team this time consisted of more than 90% sandy shale and carbonaceous shale, which is harder than the medium-hard and below medium-hard rock layers tunneled in late November last year when they set the previous record. After studying this new situation, they added a groove hole and a reaming hole on both sides of the groove after the first blasting pass, making the first groove blasted larger than the first groove blasted last time, thus improving the blasting efficiency. At the same time, they also made appropriate improvements to the cyclical tunneling method. Previously, they used a two-hole cycle method. However, the hardness of the rock layer in the two holes was not consistent. When the slag removal work in the hole with the softer rock layer had been completed, the drilling and blasting work in the hole with the harder rock layer had not yet been completed. Therefore, in the past, there were still instances of idle work in the tunneling work. This time, they changed the two-hole cycle to a three-hole cycle, so that drilling, blasting, roof support, and slag removal work could be appropriately adjusted, eliminating the need to wait for each other. Through these improvements, they created a record that was 4.4 meters higher than the previous national record. (Xinhua News Agency)

Yu Wenbin of Northeast No. 1 Farm Implement Factory:
Successful Transformation of the Important Tool, the Clapper Hammer

    Yu Wenbin, the workshop director of the tool workshop of Northeast No. 1 Farm Implement Factory, who came from a working-class background, has successfully transformed the clapper hammer (also called the drop hammer). This is of great significance for saving wood, electricity, and improving production efficiency.
    The clapper hammer is a major tool commonly used by forging workers in China's machinery manufacturing and repair departments. Before the transformation, its hammer shaft was made of a long and straight hardwood rod, which was raised by two axles clamping the hammer shaft, and the hammer fell when the two axles opened when the axles rotated, grinding the hammer shaft to make it rise to a certain height. However, because the clamping force on the hammer shaft was too great, it was prone to breaking due to violent vibrations when it fell, breaking on average once every three days. Last year, during the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, it often broke two or three times a day due to poor wood quality. Replacing the new hammer shaft not only consumed a large amount of wood, but also wasted more than 30 minutes each time it was replaced. Yu Wenbin's method of transforming the clapper hammer is to wrap a layer of iron plate on the outside of the hammer shaft and dig gear grooves on the iron plate; another gear is added to the axle, and the gear's rotation raises the hammer shaft. In this way, the clamping and squeezing force on the hammer shaft and the axle tile is eliminated, so the hammer shaft will not break due to vibration when it falls, and the consumption of axle tiles and electricity is greatly reduced. The results of experiments for more than a month since the transformation was successful have proved that: in the past, it took ten horsepower of electricity to lift the clapper hammer, but now it only takes five horsepower, and the power of each hammer drop has also increased by more than 30%; the hammer shaft has not broken either.
    Forging workers in China's machinery manufacturing industry commonly use clapper hammers, so it is very necessary to promote this advanced experience. If this advanced experience is promoted in various machinery factories in Shenyang, the value of wood saved each year can reach 4 billion yuan.
    Recently, many machine factories in Wuhan, Dalian, and Shenyang, as well as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, have sent people to the factory to visit and learn. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is also preparing to promote it nationwide. (Xinhua News Agency)

Fushun Mining Bureau Electrical and Mechanical Plant:
Manufactures DC Motors for Electric Locomotives

    The Fushun Mining Bureau Electrical and Mechanical Plant has successfully manufactured a 325-horsepower DC motor for electric locomotives. This type of DC motor is the main component of mine electric locomotives and has always relied on foreign imports in the past. If this type of motor is damaged, the mine electric locomotive cannot be started. The staff of the Fushun Mining Bureau Electrical and Mechanical Plant displayed a high degree of patriotism and successfully manufactured this motor on December 29, 1951. Important components of the motor, such as the commutator, auxiliary exciter, oil tank bearing, and motor cover, were all designed by workers and technicians.

    发扬工人阶级在生产上的创造性
    国营萍乡煤矿石门钢铁队
    改进工作法再创掘进新纪录
    国营萍乡煤矿石门钢铁队工人，在今年三月三日一昼夜中掘进石巷二十四点七公尺，再次创造了石巷掘进的全国新纪录。石门钢铁队这回创造新纪录时所掘进的岩层，百分之九十以上是砂质页岩和炭质页岩，这种岩层比去年十一月下旬创造新纪录时所掘进的中硬和中硬以下岩层更为坚硬。他们研究了这种新情况，便在拉完第一次转口后，在槽口两旁加打了一个槽子眼和一个?眼，使第一次所拉的槽口比上回所拉第一次槽口更为扩大，这样就提高了爆炸效力。同时在循环掘进方法上他们也作了适当的改进。以前，他们是采用两孔循环法。但两个孔的岩层硬度并不一致。岩层较软的孔中出碴工作已经作完时，岩层较硬的孔中打眼、放炮等工作还没有作完，因此，过去在掘进工作中仍有窝工现象发生。这回他们把两孔循环改为三孔循环，使打眼、放炮、架棚、出碴等工作得以适当调整，不必互相等待。经过这些改进，他们就创造了比上次全国新纪录高四点四公尺的纪录。（新华社）东北第一农具厂于文斌
    改造重要工具夹板锤成功
    东北第一农具厂工具车间工人出身的车间主任于文斌改造夹板锤（也叫落下锤）获得成功。这对于节约木材、电力和提高生产效率都有很大的意义。
    夹板锤是我国机械制造、修理部门锻工普遍使用的一种主要工具。未改造前，它的锤杆是用长而直的硬质木杆制造的，利用两个轴夹住锤杆，轴转动时辗着锤杆使其上升，到一定高度时，两轴张开锤就落下。但因锤杆所承受的夹力太大，所以落下时受猛烈震动就容易折断，平均三天就折断一次。去年增产节约运动时，曾因木质不好，常常一天折断两、三次。更换新锤杆不但耗损大批木材，并且每换一次还得浪费三十多分钟的时间。于文斌改造夹板锤的方法是：在锤杆的外面包一层铁板，在铁板上挖上齿槽；另在轴上加上齿轮，由齿轮的转动带着锤杆上升。这样，就消除了锤杆和轴瓦所受的夹力和挤力，因而锤杆下落时不会因震动折断，轴瓦和电力的消耗也大大减少。改造成功到现在一个多月来试验的结果证明：过去夹板锤升起需用十匹马力电力，现在只用五匹马力，而每锤落下来的力量还增加了百分之三十以上；锤杆也没有折断过。
    我国机械制造业锻工是普遍使用夹板锤的，所以推广这一先进经验很有必要。如果把这一先进经验在沈阳各机械工厂中推广，每年只节约木材的价值就可以达到四十亿元。
    最近武汉、大连及沈阳等市许多机器工厂以及全国总工会都派人到该厂参观和学习。全国总工会并准备在全国推广。（新华社）
    抚顺矿务局机电厂
    造成电机车直流电动机
    抚顺矿务局机电厂制造三百二十五匹马力的电机车直流电动机成功。这种直流电动机是矿用电机车的主要构成部分，过去一向依靠外国输入。这种电动机如有损坏，矿用电机车就不能开动。抚顺矿务局机电厂职工，发挥了高度的爱国主义精神，在一九五一年十二月二十九日制造这种电动机成功。电动机的重要部件，如整流子、辅加机、油箱轴承、马达盖子等，都是工人和技术人员设计出来的。
