    We will support the volunteer anti-epidemic inspection team going to North Korea just like we supported the Volunteer Army
    To the Editor: I was extremely excited when I saw the news that people from China's medical and health science circles had formed a volunteer anti-epidemic inspection team to go to the Korean front lines. I have only one feeling: under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the great People's Republic of China has no insurmountable difficulties and will not be intimidated by any threats.
    The cannons and weapons of the American robbers have lost their effectiveness under the valiant combat of the Chinese and Korean People's forces; they dream of using bacteriological weapons to make up for the losses they cannot make up for on the battlefield. However, these bacteriological weapons will also suffer a shameful defeat. The despicable and shameless tricks of the American aggressors will only arouse the indignation of peace-loving people all over the world and strengthen our determination to resist America and aid Korea, and will have no other result.
    The comrades of the anti-epidemic team, like the comrades of the Volunteer Army, bear the same arduous and great task. We will treat them as the most beloved people and support them in the same way, hoping that they will return in triumph soon!

    我们将和支援志愿军一样支援志愿赴朝防疫检验队
    编辑同志：我看到了我国医药卫生科学界人士，组成抗美援朝志愿防疫检验队赴朝鲜前线工作的消息，兴奋到了极点。我只有一个感觉：伟大的中华人民共和国，在毛主席的英明领导下，是没有战胜不了的困难的，是不会被任何威胁所吓倒的。
    美国强盗的枪炮武器，在中朝人民部队的英勇战斗下，已经失去了作用；他们梦想以细菌武器来弥补他们战场上无法弥补的损失。但是，这细菌武器也一定会遭到可耻的失败。美国侵略者卑鄙无耻的伎俩，除了激起全世界爱好和平的人们的公愤，和加强我们抗美援朝的斗志外，不会有别的结果。
    防疫队的同志，和志愿军的同志一样，负着同样的艰巨而伟大的任务。我们将同样地以最可爱的人看待他们，支援他们，希望他们早日奏凯归来！
