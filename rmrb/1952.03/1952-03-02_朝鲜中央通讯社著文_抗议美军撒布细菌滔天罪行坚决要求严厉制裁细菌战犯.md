    Korean Central News Agency Article
    Protests Heinous Crimes of U.S. Military Spreading Bacteria; Firmly Demands Severe Sanctions Against Germ Warfare Criminals
    [Xinhua News Agency, 1st] The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on February 29th entitled "The Death Struggle of the Human Enemy, U.S. Imperialism," stating that the beastly atrocities of the U.S. aggressors in spreading bacteria in the front and rear of Korea have aroused the unparalleled anger of all Korean people and the 475 million Chinese people. Foreign Minister Park Heon-yeong of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China have respectively lodged serious protests on behalf of the people of the two countries.
    As is well known, the U.S. man-eating barbarians, while suffering military and political failures in the Korean War, have ferociously trampled on international law and committed beastly atrocities more than once or twice. As early as the period from December 1950 to January 1951, when the enemy suffered a disastrous defeat in the face of the heroic counterattacks of the Korean and Chinese People's forces, they spread smallpox bacteria in the vast areas of northern Korea. In February and August of 1951, the enemy used poison gas shells successively on the Han River front and in Yanbai area of Hwanghae Province. Later, the enemy even used a large number of our captured personnel as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons and atomic bombs. The beastly atrocities committed by U.S. imperialism are becoming more and more cruel, the scope is becoming wider and wider, and the means are becoming more and more vicious.
    The commentary wrote: The planned atrocities committed by U.S. imperialism are clearly a desperate struggle to save themselves from defeat. However, just as the myth of "technical omnipotence" believed by the U.S. aggressors has suffered a shameful bankruptcy in the face of the Korean and Chinese People's forces, the mad atrocities of the U.S. bandits cannot save them from their fate of failure.
    The commentary continued to point out: All the Korean people, who are extremely indignant at the towering crimes of the U.S. aggressor bandits in carrying out germ warfare, have further raised their revolutionary vigilance and are more determined to kill the enemy and avenge themselves. The fraternal 475 million Chinese people are an inexhaustible force for us to defeat the enemy's germ warfare. The commentary emphasized: The U.S. executioners who collude with Japanese germ warfare criminals and massacre the Korean people will undoubtedly suffer the same shameful fate as the Japanese militarists.
    The commentary concluded: We, the Korean people, firmly demand that the war criminals who organized germ warfare be given just sanctions. If the U.S. aggressor bandits do not immediately stop their heinous crimes, we will resolutely give them relentless blows and punishment.

    抗议美军撒布细菌滔天罪行坚决要求严厉制裁细菌战犯
    【新华社一日讯】朝鲜中央通讯社在二月二十九日发表题为“人类公敌美帝国主义的垂死挣扎”的评论称：美国侵略者在朝鲜前后方大量撒布细菌的野兽暴行，已激起了全朝鲜人民和四亿七千五百万中国人民的无比愤怒。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永和中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来已分别代表朝中两国人民先后提出严正的抗议。
    如所周知，美国吃人生番在侵朝战争中遭到军事上、政治上的失败的同时，凶恶地蹂躏国际公法，制造野兽暴行，已不止一两次。早在一九五零年十二月到一九五一年一月的期间，敌人当时在朝中人民部队的英勇反攻面前遭到惨败，就曾在朝鲜北部的广大地区撒布了天花细菌。在一九五一年的二月和八月，敌人又先后在汉江前线和黄海道的延白地区使用了毒气炮弹。其后，敌人竟用大批我方被俘人员作为细菌武器和原子弹的试验对象。美帝国主义所制造的野兽暴行越来越残忍，范围越来越广大，手段也越来越毒辣。
    评论写道：美帝国主义有计划地制造暴行，显然是为了挽救其失败而进行的垂死挣扎。然而，正像美国侵略者所迷信的“技术万能”的神话在朝中人民部队面前所遭到的可耻破产一样，美国强盗的疯狂暴行是无法挽救其失败的命运的。
    评论继指出：为美国侵略强盗进行细菌战的滔天罪行而感到无比愤怒的全朝鲜人民，已经进一步提高了革命的警惕性，更加坚定了杀敌报仇的决心。兄弟般的四亿七千五百万中国人民更是我们战胜敌人的细菌战的无穷力量。评论强调指出：勾结日本细菌战犯、虐杀朝鲜人民的美国刽子手们，无疑地将遭到和日本军国主义者同样的可耻失败的命运。
    评论最后说：我们朝鲜人民坚决要求予组织细菌战的战争罪犯以正义的制裁。如果美国侵略强盗不立刻停止其万恶罪行，我们将坚决给予他们无情的打击和惩罚。
