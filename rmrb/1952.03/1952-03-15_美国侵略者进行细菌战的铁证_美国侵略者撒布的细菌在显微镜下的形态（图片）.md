Ironclad Proof of the Bacteriological Warfare by the American Aggressors
Microscopic Images of Bacteria Spread by the American Aggressors

I. This is the complete shape of a bacteriological bomb dropped by the American aggressors (the picture was taken after the shell was disinfected and put back together).
II. This is one type of bacteriological bomb dropped by the American aggressors. After landing, it splits into two halves, and insects carrying bacteria are scattered.
III. Another bacteriological bomb dropped by the American aggressors—the M-15 bacteriological bomb. There are English letters on the shell.
IV. The bacteria-carrying poisonous insects dropped by the American aggressors, which can be seen under a microscope to carry a large number of germs.
V. This is the shape of the small black insect spread by the American aggressors, observed under a microscope. This small black insect is 0.1 cm long and 0.003 cm wide. The picture shows its side view.
VI. Another type of bacteriological bomb dropped by the American aggressors that explodes upon landing. This is the crater and shrapnel after the explosion. Many flies are attached to the shrapnel.
VII. This is a pile of bacteria-carrying flies dropped by the American aggressors. These bacteria-carrying flies are smaller than ordinary flies and can crawl but not fly. The types of bacteria they carry include: Meningococcus, Tetracoccus, and Bacillus anthracis.
VIII. This is a type of poisonous insect similar to a mosquito, spread by American aggressor planes intruding into our country's territory.
IX. This is a type of poisonous insect that can fly, walk, and dive, spread by American aggressor planes intruding into our country.

    美国侵略者进行细菌战的铁证
    美国侵略者撒布的细菌在显微镜下的形态
    一、这是美国侵略者投下的细菌弹的完整形状（把弹壳消毒后对起来照的）。
    二、这是美国侵略者投下的细菌炸弹的一种，落地后分成两瓣，带细菌的昆虫便散布出来。
    三、美国侵略者所投的另一种细菌弹——M一五细菌弹。弹壳上有英文字母。
    四、美国侵略者投下的带细菌毒虫，在显微镜下可以看出带有大量病菌。
    五、这是美国侵略者撒布的小黑虫在显微镜下观察的形状。这种小黑虫身长○·一公分，身宽○·○○三公分。图为它的侧面形状。
    六、美国侵略者所投的另一种落地后就爆炸的细菌弹，这是爆炸后的弹坑和弹片，弹片上还附有许多苍蝇。
    七、这是一堆美国侵略者投下的带细菌的苍蝇。这种带细菌的苍蝇较普通苍蝇为小，能爬不能飞。所带细菌种类，计有：脑膜炎双球菌、四联球菌和炭疽杆菌等。
    八、这是美国侵略者飞机侵入我国境内撒布的一种类似蚊子的毒虫。
    九、这是美国侵略者飞机侵入我国撒布的一种能飞、能走、能潜水的毒虫。
