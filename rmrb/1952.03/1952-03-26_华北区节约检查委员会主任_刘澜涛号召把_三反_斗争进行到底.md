    [Report from this newspaper] The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in all county-level and above organs, factories, enterprises, and schools in North China has achieved great success after three months of intensive work by all cadres and the broad masses, with all levels of leading organs and responsible cadres going all out, especially after about four large-scale and fierce "tiger"-hunting campaigns. Currently, a decisive battle is underway, which is the extremely intense large-scale work of verification, recovery of赃款(stolen money/goods), case determination, and handling. At the same time, concentrate certain forces to launch a final attack on "hidden tigers" and "tiger gangs" on a case-by-case basis, striving for complete victory, and on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles, fight for a new upsurge of patriotic production in rural areas and industrial increase in cities.
    After the State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Regulations of the Central Thrift Inspection Committee on Handling Corruption, Waste, and Overcoming Bureaucratic Errors," the North China District Thrift Inspection Committee convened a meeting to study and discuss this important document. Liu Lantao, Director of the North China District Thrift Inspection Committee, gave a detailed analysis and estimation of the new situation of struggle and the victories already achieved in North China, and also made clear and practical elaborations on the important measures to be taken in the future.
    In his report, Liu Lantao explained the great victories achieved in the three months of the "Three-Anti" struggle; the continued maintenance of high morale and determination to eliminate evil by all cadres; the further enhancement and strengthening of the political consciousness and organizational strength of all the people in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles; and the timely promulgation of this important document by the State Council as a powerful weapon for the current struggle. These three factors have made the "Three-Anti" struggle fully equipped to achieve a swift and complete victory. This document of the State Council plays an extremely important role in completely subduing all corrupt elements, defeating the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie, and promoting national construction work. In the great "Three-Anti" struggle, on the one hand, a large number of corrupt elements have been investigated and brought to light, and most of the things that have rotted due to the fierce erosion of bourgeois ideology have been eliminated. The great struggle has increasingly exposed the ugly facts of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on state organs and staff, making people feel shocked. Even those who previously underestimated this have now mostly awakened and actively participated in the struggle. On the other hand, the great victory of the "Three-Anti" struggle has produced extremely good results in all aspects of people's lives and the work of state organs. Prices throughout the region are more stable, and the enthusiasm of workers and farmers for production is increasing. The common belief of the workers is: "This time it's good, we won't produce in vain anymore, and we can create wealth for the country with peace of mind." The slogan they put forward is: "Produce while fighting tigers, one person does the work of two." The total output of many public factories in Tianjin in February has exceeded the administrative plan by 10.4%, and the quality has also been significantly improved; seven factories have successfully converted their boiler rooms to burn Datong pulverized coal, which can save more than 2 billion yuan annually. When celebrating, the workers said: "The money saved is insured." The state-owned Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Pingyuan Province has achieved good results in tiger hunting. The workers there are "catching tigers above the well and increasing production below the well." In January and February, serious injuries, deaths, and other major accidents were eliminated, and production in February exceeded the original increased production plan by 75%. In Chahar Province, 80% of the 60 production units have shifted to anti-waste and anti-bureaucracy since March 1, and the new atmosphere is growing day by day, which is exciting. The factories and mines in Xuanhua City can not only complete their production tasks in March, but also make up for the deficiencies in January and February. In the past, it was difficult for the state-owned magnetic factory in the city to implement the labor discipline and handover systems stipulated administratively. After the "Three-Anti" struggle was launched, the workers formulated their own labor discipline and handover systems, and signed and sealed them, which greatly improved labor efficiency. The factory director was amazed by the new labor enthusiasm of the workers and said: "Now production is unprecedentedly good. In the past, I thought that the 'Three-Anti' hindered production, but now I actually see that the 'Three-Anti' has promoted production and improved production." Although the "Three-Anti" struggle has not yet been carried out in rural areas, its impact has further enhanced the patriotic production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. They believe that "blocking loopholes is the only way to increase production" and realize the serious fact that the embezzled money of only a few corrupt elements can be equal to the public grain paid to the state by the people in half a district. Therefore, they said: "It won't do without the Three-Anti." After this major democratic reform, the work efficiency of state organs has been unprecedentedly improved. Some people compare it to a newly renovated house. The sunlight shines in, everyone is full of energy, and they feel particularly energetic when working. Many leading cadres believe that the "Three-Anti" movement has given them more education than any previous democratic movement. Those who did not admit that they had bureaucracy in the past have now awakened, admitted it, and deeply felt the seriousness of the problem. Many people used to envy and imitate the corrupt life of the bourgeoisie, thinking it was "very fragrant," but now they feel it is "very smelly." The bad habit of talking about "ostentation" and making a "generous show" has been swept away, and replaced by a style of being proud of being honest and simple; the concept of cherishing public property has been universally strengthened. In short, a new social atmosphere and morality are growing rapidly. On the one hand, everything rotten has been resolutely removed by revolutionary means, and on the other hand, many positive and infinitely dynamic new things have grown and are growing widely. This is the fundamental harvest of the "Three-Anti" struggle that has lasted for more than three months. This alone is sufficient to illustrate the determination and ability of the people's country under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party to eliminate the filth left over from the old society and repel the attacks of the bourgeoisie, and to demonstrate the full superiority of the new democratic social system.
    In summarizing this situation, Liu Lantao pointed out: Precisely because of this, our struggle must not be relaxed, it must be carried through to the end, only complete victory is allowed, and a sloppy ending is not allowed. Some people say that the "Three-Anti" struggle has broken up the stall. Yes, we broke up some stalls ourselves, and it was absolutely right to do so; because they were things that had already rotted. Some departments or some "cadres" are neatly organized on the surface, as if they still belong to the state and the people, but in fact they have long been "disguised" and "replaced with inferior goods," becoming agents of the bourgeoisie and completely rotten. Since it is rotten, it should be dug out. How much is rotten, dig out how much. In short, eliminate evil completely, do not regret it, and do not be afraid to reorganize. Units that have carried out the "Three-Anti" struggle thoroughly or basically thoroughly must be appropriately and systematically contracted in a timely manner; but units that have not carried out the struggle thoroughly or are only close to being thorough must not be hastily ended or have any slackening phenomenon; they should learn from the spirit of the workers "fighting tigers while producing," supplementing cadres as needed and appropriately dividing leadership, and must carry out the "Three-Anti" struggle to the end, to achieve complete success, and not withdraw troops without complete victory.
    How to carry the struggle through to the end? Liu Lantao pointed out: The leading organs at all levels must make a realistic analysis and estimation of the "Three-Anti" struggle in their subordinate areas and departments, classify them, formulate specific plans, organize the masses according to the tasks, and fight correctly. First, vigorously do a good job in verifying evidence, recovering贓款 (stolen money/goods), determining cases, and handling them. This is an extremely important sign of whether the anti-corruption struggle is thorough or not, and cannot be ignored. This is a more acute and complex struggle. If it is not organized as a serious battle, it will be impossible to achieve complete victory. Countless facts have proved that the "Regulations of the Central Thrift Inspection Committee on Handling Corruption, Waste, and Overcoming Bureaucratic Errors" promulgated by the State Council is a powerful weapon to promote the verification of evidence, the recovery of贓款(stolen money/goods), the determination of cases, the handling of cases, and the final elimination of "hidden tigers." It is obviously completely incorrect for some people to mistakenly regard this document as a passive way to deal with problems, rather than as a powerful weapon to completely subdue corrupt elements and defeat the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie. The work of verifying evidence, recovering赃款(stolen money/goods), determining cases, and handling them must continue to mobilize the masses, adopt a pursuing spirit, repel the attempts of corrupt elements to recant, and use methods such as calculating large accounts and calculating small accounts, extensively strengthening investigation and research, doing a good job in the work of family members, defeating the evasions of those who have hidden stolen goods, and thoroughly shattering all "offensive and defensive alliances" to further consolidate and expand the victorious results of the anti-corruption struggle. The main responsible comrades of all levels and departments should personally preside over large-scale typical conferences of the masses to handle various types of corrupt elements, explain policies with living people and living events, deal with some leniently, and punish some more severely. And call on all corrupt elements to quickly bow their heads to confess their crimes, repent, and exchange for the state's lenient treatment. They should be warned not to be obsessed with their errors and test the law, otherwise, the law will come upon them, and it will be too late to regret. All localities must also start organizing the work of people's courts to deal with the corrupt elements who have been convicted and should be subject to criminal punishment or exempted from criminal punishment in a timely manner. Second, all organs and departments that have "hidden tigers" remaining, no matter what they are disguised with, and no matter how consolidated the so-called "offensive and defensive alliance" they rely on, must continue to organize forces to carry out individual or partial attacks, without injustice or indulgence, without laziness or impatience, and must capture all the tigers, and never raise tigers to cause trouble; otherwise, there will be no thorough anti-corruption struggle, and mistakes will be made. Third, in units and departments where the anti-corruption struggle has been basically thorough, those who have not thoroughly opposed waste must make up for the anti-waste campaign, and those who have not thoroughly opposed bureaucracy must make up for the anti-bureaucracy campaign, especially in places where the leaders have not made in-depth self-criticism and democratic reforms are not thorough, they must all make up the lessons in a short period of time. This is one. Secondly, all organs and enterprises should convene general meetings of all personnel or representative conferences or meetings of various natures to summarize the experience of the struggle and use the living experience to educate cadres and the masses. Calling on all state organs and staff in all aspects to draw a clear line of class, improve awareness, is the state's responsibility to the cadres. The cadres of the country should all conduct this inspection with a loyal and honest attitude. Again, a large number and boldly promote outstanding elements who have emerged from the struggle to various leadership positions, adjust and enrich various institutions, and streamline and abolish all institutions that can be streamlined and abolished. The "Three-Anti" struggle has tested and improved people's thinking, and trained a large number of cadres with firm positions and both ability and integrity. We must attach importance to this achievement and immediately use it. At the same time, it is necessary to establish new systems related to political, economic, organizational life, and daily work in a timely manner. In short, it is necessary to consolidate and expand the victorious results of the "Three-Anti" struggle politically, ideologically, organizationally, and institutionally.
    When the "Three-Anti" struggle above the county level is roughly close to being thorough, in order to prevent some places from hastily ending the "Three-Anti" movement, Liu Lantao definitely pointed out: The ending approval system stipulated at the beginning of the "Three-Anti" struggle must be implemented without exception. In addition to the party committees at all levels checking the "Three-Anti" struggle of all organs at the same level under their jurisdiction, the superior organs of each system must also conduct inspections of their subordinate departments. An organ or department must be approved by the local party committee and by the superior leading department before the "Three-Anti" movement can be ended. By doing so, a guarantee is added to the complete victory of the "Three-Anti" struggle.
    Finally, Liu Lantao pointed out: At present, the spring ploughing season in rural areas has arrived, and the production of factories and mines in cities and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas urgently need to be rectified and strengthened. In addition to adhering to the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles with the necessary and sufficient strength to achieve complete victory, the party organizations and government organs in all localities must concentrate their efforts on organizing and leading the spring ploughing in rural areas and the production and economic work in cities on the new and unprecedentedly favorable basis of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and fight for a new upsurge of patriotic production and industrial increase.

    华北区节约检查委员会主任
    刘澜涛号召把“三反”斗争进行到底
    【本报讯】华北全区县级以上机关和工厂、企业、学校的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，经过全体干部和广大群众三个月来的紧张工作，各级领导机关和负责干部全力以赴，特别是经过四次左右大规模的猛烈的打“虎”战役之后，已获得巨大成就。当前正在进行一个带有决定意义的战役，这就是极为紧张的大规模的对证追赃、定案处理的工作。同时集中一定力量，专人专案地向“窝虎”“群虎”作最后的攻击，务获全胜，并在“三反”、“五反”斗争胜利的基础上，为农村中爱国丰产和城市中工业增产的新高潮而斗争。
    中央人民政府政务院颁布“中央节约检查委员会关于处理贪污、浪费及克服官僚主义错误的若干规定”后，华北区节约检查委员会曾召集会议，对这
    一重要文件加以研究和讨论。华北区节约检查委员会主任刘澜涛在会上就目前华北区所出现的新的斗争形势和已获得的胜利，作了详尽的分析和估计，对今后所应采取的重要措施，亦有明确实际的阐述。
    刘澜涛在报告中说明：三个月的“三反”斗争已获得的伟大胜利；全体干部继续保持昂扬的斗志和除恶务尽的决心，全体人民在“三反”、“五反”斗争中政治觉悟和组织力量更加提高和壮大，再加上政务院适时地公布了这一重要文件作为当前斗争的有力武器，这三者，使得“三反”斗争已具有迅速获得彻底胜利的充分条件。政务院这个文件对于彻底制服一切贪污分子，战胜资产阶级的猖狂进攻和推进国家建设工作，都有其极为重要的作用。在伟大的“三反”斗争中，一方面，大批贪污分子已被我们清查出来，一切因资产阶级思想猛烈侵蚀而腐烂的东西大部清除了。伟大的斗争，把资产阶级向国家机关和工作人员猖狂进攻的丑恶事实愈益暴露无遗，使人触目惊心，即使过去对此估计十分不够的人们，现在也已大都猛醒过来，积极参加斗争了。另一方面，“三反”斗争的伟大胜利，已在人民生活和国家机关工作的各方面，产生了极为良好的结果。全区的物价更加平稳了，工人和农民的生产积极性越来越高。工人们的共同信念是：“这回可好了，我们再不会白白生产了，可以放心给国家创造财富了。”他们提出的口号是：“一面生产，一面打虎，
    一个人顶着两个人干”。天津不少公营工厂二月份总产量已超过行政计划的百分之十点四，质量也有显著提高；七个厂的锅炉房改烧大同末煤成功，全年可节省二十余亿，工人们在庆贺时说：“节省下的这些钱是保险的”。平原国营焦作煤矿打虎成绩很好，那里的工人是在“井上捉虎，井下增产”，一、二月份消灭了重伤、死亡及其他重大事故，二月份生产超过原增产计划的百分之七十五。察哈尔全省六十个生产单位，三月一日后已有百分之八十转入反浪费、反官僚主义，更新气象与日俱增，令人兴奋。宣化市各厂矿三月份不仅可以完成生产任务，并可补上一、二月份任务的缺额。该市国营磁厂过去行政上规定的劳动纪律和交接班等制度难于行通，
    “三反”斗争开展后，工人自定劳动纪律和交接班制度，并签名盖章，劳动效率大大提高。该厂厂长惊叹工人新的劳动热情，说：“现在生产空前的好，过去我认为‘三反’妨碍生产，现在实际看到的却是‘三反’推进了生产，提高了生产。”农村虽暂不进行“三反”斗争，但影响所及，使广大农民的爱国增产热情也进一步有所提高。他们认为“堵住了漏洞，增产才有个闹头”，并且认识到只是几个贪污分子的贪污款项就能等于半个区老百姓向国家缴纳的公粮的严重事实。因此，他们说：“不三反不得了。”国家机关经过这一次重大的民主改革，工作效率空前提高。有人比之为一座重新修饰过的房子，太阳光照进来了，大家都生气勃勃，干工作特别感到有劲。许多领导干部认为“三反”运动给他的教育超过以往任何一次民主运动。过去不承认自己有官僚主义的，现在觉悟了，承认了，而且深感问题之严重。许多人过去羡慕、摹仿资产阶级的腐朽生活，认为“香得很”，现在则觉得“臭得很”。讲“排场”闹“大方”的恶习为之一扫，起而代之的是以廉洁、朴素为荣的风尚；普遍地加强了爱护公共财产的观念。总之，新的社会风气和道德在飞跃地成长。一方面是以革命手段坚决地去掉了一切腐烂的东西，另方面生长了和正在广泛地生长着许多积极的有无限活力的新事物，这就是历时三个多月的“三反”斗争的根本收获。就此一桩，已可充分说明在毛主席、共产党领导下的人民的国家清除旧社会遗留下的污毒和击退资产阶级进攻的决心与能力，显示了新民主主义社会制度的充分优越性。
    刘澜涛在总结这种情况时指出：正因为如此，我们的斗争决不可以松懈，必须贯彻到底，只许彻底胜利，不许虎头蛇尾。有人说：“三反”斗争把摊子打烂了。是的，我们自己动手打烂了一些摊子，而这样做是完全对的；因为，它们是早已烂了的东西。有些部门或有些“干部”表面上整整齐齐，好像还是属于国家和人民的样子，实则早已“改头换面”、“偷梁换柱”，变成资产阶级的代理人，烂透了。既然烂了，就应该挖掉，烂了多少，就挖掉多少。总之，除恶务尽，不要惋惜，不要怕重新收拾。“三反”斗争已经进行彻底或基本彻底的单位，自须适时地有计划地予以收缩；但尚未进行彻底或仅是接近彻底的单位，绝不能草率结束或有任何松劲现象；应学习工人“一面打虎，一面生产”的精神，干部随缺随补，领导适当分工，务必将“三反”斗争进行到底，以竟全功，不全胜不收兵。
    如何将斗争进行到底呢？刘澜涛指出：各级领导机关对所属地区和部门的“三反”斗争情况，必须作一切实的分析与估计，分别类型，作出具体的计划，根据任务，组织群众，正确作战。第一、大力做好对证追赃、定案处理的工作。这是反贪污斗争彻底与否的一个极端重要的标志，不容忽视。这是一场更为尖锐复杂的斗争，不作为一个严重的战役来组织，便不可能获得全胜。无数事实证明，政务院公布的“中央节约检查委员会关于处理贪污、浪费及克服官僚主义错误的若干规定”，是推进对证追赃、定案处理以及最后肃清“窝虎”的强有力的武器。有人错误地把这一文件当作一种消极处理问题的办法，而不把它看作是当前彻底制服贪污分子、战胜资产阶级猖狂进攻的有力武器，显然是完全不正确的。对证追赃、定案处理的工作，必须继续发动群众，采取追击精神，打退贪污分子的翻供企图，并用算大账算细账、广泛加强调查研究、做好家属工作、战胜存赃者的狡赖、彻底粉碎一切“攻守同盟”等办法，以进一步巩固与扩大反贪污斗争的胜利成果。各级各部门主要负责同志，都应亲自主持召开群众性的、大规模的处理各类贪污分子的典型大会，用活人活事交代政策，宽大处理一些，加重处分一些。并号召一切贪污分子赶快低头认罪，回心向善，换取国家的宽大处理。应告诫他们，不可执迷不悟，以身试法，否则，法必临头，后悔莫及。各地并须着手组织人民法庭的工作，以便及时处理业经定案的应受刑事处分或免除刑事处分的贪污分子。第二、各机关各部门，凡是残存着“窝虎”的，不管他用什么东西伪装着，也不管他凭借多么巩固的所谓“攻守同盟”，也必须继续组织力量，进行个别的或局部的进攻，不枉不纵，勿怠勿躁，务将所有老虎捉尽，绝不养虎贻患；不如此，就谈不到反贪污斗争的彻底，就会犯错误。第三、反贪污斗争进行基本彻底的单位和部门，凡反浪费不彻底者要补行反浪费，反官僚主义不彻底者补行反官僚主义，尤其是领导人未作深刻检讨、民主改革不彻底的地方，一律须在短期内进行补课，这是一。其次，各机关各企业单位应召开全体人员大会或各种性质的代表大会或代表会议，总结斗争经验，用活的经验去教育干部和群众。号召一切国家机关的和各方面的工作人员，划清阶级界限，提高觉悟，这是国家对干部负责的表现。国家的干部则一概应以忠诚老实的态度，进行此项检查。再次，大量、大胆地提拔从斗争中涌现出来的优秀分子，到各个领导工作岗位上来，调整、充实各种机构，并精简和取消一切可以精简和取消的机构。“三反”斗争考验了也提高了人们的思想，锻炼出了大批立场坚定、德才兼备的干部，我们必须重视此项成果，并立即运用起来。同时必须及时建立有关政治、经济、组织生活和日常工作等各项新的制度。总之，必须从政治上、思想上、组织上、制度上巩固和扩大“三反”斗争的胜利成果。
    在县以上“三反”斗争大致接近彻底的时候，为防止某些地方草率结束“三反”运动，刘澜涛肯定地指出：必须毫无例外地实行“三反”斗争开始时所规定的结束批准制。除各级党委应检查所属同级一切机关的“三反”斗争外，各系统的上级机关对其所属下级部门，亦须进行检查，一个机关或部门要结束“三反”运动，除应经过当地党委批准外，并应经过上级领导部门批准。这样做，“三反”斗争的彻底胜利，就增加了一项保证。
    最后，刘澜涛指出：目前农村春耕季节已到，城市的厂矿生产和城乡物资交流亟需整顿和加强，各地党的组织和政府机关，除了以必要的和足够的力量坚持“三反”和“五反”斗争，达到完全胜利外，必须在“三反”、“五反”运动新的空前有利的基础上，集中力量组织与领导农村春耕和城市的生产与经济工作，为爱国丰产和工业增产的新高潮而斗争。
