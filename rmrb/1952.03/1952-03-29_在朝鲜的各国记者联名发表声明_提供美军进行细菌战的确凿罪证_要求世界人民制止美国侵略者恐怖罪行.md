Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 28th: Kim Jong-yun, reporter for the Pyongyang "Democratic Korea" newspaper; Zhu Qiping, reporter for the Shanghai, Chongqing, and Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" newspapers; Alan Winnington, reporter for the London "Daily Worker"; Pierre Biquard, reporter for the Paris "Ce Soir" newspaper; Méray Tibor, reporter for the Budapest "Szabad Nép" newspaper; and Jerzy Bański, reporter for the Warsaw "Żołnierz Wolności" newspaper, issued a joint statement on the US military's germ warfare in Korea. With the exception of Jerzy Bański, who arrived in Korea on August 23, 1951, the other reporters have been consistently covering the Korean armistice negotiations. The following is the full text of the statement:

We are reporters who have been consistently covering the armistice negotiations. After hearing the allegations about the US military's germ warfare, we divided into two groups to conduct investigations. We went to the front lines and the rear areas near and far from the front lines—western Korea, especially the Pyongyang area—investigating these allegations together or in small groups.

We have submitted detailed reports on our investigations to our newspapers, but in view of the great historical significance of these events and the seriousness of these allegations, we believe we also have a responsibility to briefly state our conclusions for the judgment of world public opinion.

We have visited many widely distributed areas, interviewed hundreds of people, including soldiers, civilians, bacteriologists, doctors, medical personnel, and personnel from hygiene departments at all levels, and we have reached the following conclusions:

(1) The American military is using a wide variety of bacteriological weapons on a large scale in an attempt to kill the army and civilians in North Korea, especially civilians. (2) The close cooperation between the government and the people, as well as the social consciousness, discipline, and courage of the masses, can and are coping with and defeating these weapons. These weapons are being defeated here. There are currently no epidemics.

The evidence of the US military's crimes is conclusive. We found that they used aircraft to spread a wide variety of insects carrying highly virulent infectious germs or to launch specially made shells to spread these insects. Many of these insects have never been seen in Korea, and others are local insects that would not normally appear in this season.

Flies, fleas, mosquitoes, and spiders are the most common poisonous insects spread, in addition to lice, gnats, bedbugs, ants, and other poisonous insects. There are also germ-carrying meat, fish, rags, feathers, and straw.

These things carry many types of bacteria, the most common being plague and cholera bacteria, as well as relapsing fever and typhoid bacteria. Plague is a disease that has never occurred in Korean history, and cholera, except for an outbreak in South Korea in 1946, has not been seen in sixty years.

On one occasion, we heard all the adults in a village say that the insects that appeared after American planes flew over were absolutely never seen before, and these insects all carried poisonous germs.

When dropping germ-carrying insects, they usually also dropped propaganda leaflets, and on the front lines, they launched propaganda shells. This was also the case in the central district of Pyongyang. As a result, in the sixth squad of the second district of Nanmenli in Pyongyang, three people, Han Chengguo, sixty-eight years old, and his two grandsons (one six years old and one two years old), died of cholera. At that time, the area had not had time to take epidemic prevention measures. As of March 19, these were the only three people who had died of infectious diseases in Pyongyang.

Most of the poisonous insects were dropped by aircraft at night or on cloudy days. The planes flew very low. The containers containing the germ-carrying insects were paper packages, such as those dropped in the central district of Pyongyang on March 5; leaflet shells, such as those dropped in Kongdong Village (transliteration) on February 27; and plastic containers, sometimes directly scattered by specially made aircraft, such as those dropped in Zhudong Village (transliteration), a small village near Kaesong. The US military seems to have tried every means to spread poisonous insects in or near rivers, streams, ponds, and springs, especially poisonous insects carrying cholera bacteria, such as those they spread near the capital water source, the Taedong River, in Xinlongli (transliteration), twenty kilometers from Pyongyang, on February 27.

Some of the germ-carrying insects froze to death after falling, but many were still alive—they were extremely cold-resistant insects that had been specially cultivated. Ten days after most of the flies were burned to death, we personally saw some live flies on the ice. We saw that some flies could fly a few hours after falling. The habits displayed by the germ-carrying insects after being discovered, as described by witnesses across the country, were very similar. For example, flies were usually drowsy for the first few hours, but then they could fly about one meter above the ground, and after a few more hours, they could fly twice as high, and then they began to spread out.

There is no doubt that the United States wants to take advantage of the warming weather to make people think that infectious diseases are occurring naturally. They are spreading poisonous insects at night and on cloudy days and using weapons that appear superficially no different from ordinary propaganda weapons to spread poisonous insects, attempting to conceal their crimes. This weapon is more vicious than any other weapon. The United States hopes that the victims will have to destroy the evidence in order to defend themselves. But this evasive tactic will not succeed, because there are tens of thousands of witnesses, there are non-native species of insects and bacteria manufactured in laboratories that have never been seen in Korea, and there is a large amount of indisputable and completely conclusive evidence. We are reporters who are accustomed to dealing with facts, and we must believe the evidence we have seen and heard with our own eyes and ears, rather than the words of Acheson and Ridgway.

We have not only seen the American bacteriological offensive, but also the great and victorious struggle against this offensive. As has often been the case in the past, the United States has completely underestimated the strength of the Korean and Chinese people. The people and the army throughout the country immediately mobilized to fight this new threat. The government ordered all military and civilians to be vaccinated, and almost every square meter of North Korea was cleaned and inspected by epidemic prevention committees and epidemic prevention teams. The people did not flee from the small artificial plague sites, allowing them to expand. They fully trusted the measures of their own government, and with the medical assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, they stayed to fight. It can be said that the number of people killed by the United States in this way is far less than the number of people killed by the same number of planes with ordinary bombs. We know that over-detailing the methods of dealing with germ warfare and the relative effectiveness of the various methods used by the United States can help criminals improve their methods. But we can say that every man, woman, and child in North Korea now knows about this new weapon and how to deal with it. The people and the government have now put all their strength into dealing with it, so no epidemics have occurred in the past or present.

The US Air Force has turned Korea into ruins; no other country in the world has done anything like this. The living conditions of the Korean people are extremely difficult. But despite all the difficulties, they are united as one to fight this new offensive. Despite their poor living conditions, plague and cholera have not been able to spread.

We believe that this is a historically and internationally astonishingly important fact in the struggle against war and for peace.

The above is a brief description of our conclusions after several weeks of investigation in the main areas subjected to bacteriological attacks.

We have been consistently covering the armistice negotiations, and we believe that this offensive is the last struggle to continue and expand the Korean War at a critical moment when world public opinion is demanding the rapid completion of the Panmunjom talks. The United States has failed to fight back to China by force, and it now hopes to force the people of Asian countries to submit by spreading infectious diseases throughout the East. They hope to intimidate the Asian people in other countries who are fighting for freedom. They want to complete this experiment before the signing of the Korean armistice agreement.

We reporters, who have seen Warsaw destroyed, reported on the horrific weapons of mass slaughter used by the United States in Hiroshima, lived in devastated Budapest, experienced the horrors of the Japanese occupation of China, and participated in the defense of London from Nazi air raids, now see the US Air Force destroying Korea. We have the right and obligation to appeal to all people of conscience in the world to demand the cessation of this new crime against humanity, which contains the seeds of destroying the nations of the world, and to demand that the criminals responsible for this matter be punished.

    在朝鲜的各国记者联名发表声明
    提供美军进行细菌战的确凿罪证
    要求世界人民制止美国侵略者恐怖罪行
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】平壤“民主朝鲜”报记者金锺允、上海重庆香港“大公报”记者朱启平、伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿、巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌、布达佩斯“自由人民报”记者梅劳依、华沙“自由战士报”记者白士基，就侵朝美军进行细菌战一事发表联合声明。除了白士基一人于一九五一年八月二十三日抵达朝鲜以外，其余记者都始终在采访朝鲜停战谈判的新闻。以下是声明全文：
    我们是一直在采访停战谈判新闻的记者。我们在听到关于美军进行细菌战的指责以后，就分成两组进行调查。我们曾到前线和离前线很近与很远的后方——朝鲜西部、特别是平壤地区——在一起或分成小组调查这种指责。
    我们已向我们的报纸提出关于我们的调查的详细报告，但是鉴于这种事件的重大历史意义和这种指责的严重性，我们认为我们也有责任扼要说出我们的结论，供全世界舆论判断。
    我们到过许多分布很广的地区，访问过好几百人，其中包括军人、平民、细菌学家、医生、医务人员和各级卫生机关人员，我们得出以下结论：
    （一）美国军队正在大规模使用种类繁多的细菌武器，企图杀害朝鲜北部的军队和平民，特别是平民。（二）政府与人民的密切合作以及群众的社会意识、纪律和勇气可以而且也正在应付和击败这种武器。这种武器正在此间被击败着。现在并没有发生传染病。
    美军的罪证是确凿的。我们发现他们用飞机撒布种类繁多的带有为害剧烈的传染病菌的昆虫，或发射特制的炮弹，以撒布这种昆虫。其中许多种昆虫是朝鲜从来没有见过的，另外一些是通常不会在这个季节出现的本地种昆虫。
    苍蝇、跳蚤、蚊子和蜘蛛是撒布下的最普通的毒虫，此外还有虱子、蚋、臭虫、蚂蚁以及其他毒虫。另外还有带菌的肉、鱼、破布、羽毛和稻草。
    这些东西带有的细菌的种类很多，最常见的是鼠疫菌和霍乱菌，另外还有回归热菌和伤寒菌。鼠疫是朝鲜历史上从来没有发生过的疾病，霍乱除了在
    一九四六年在南朝鲜流行过一次以外，六十年来都没有见过。
    有一次我们听一个村庄的全体成人说，美国飞机飞过以后出现的昆虫是一向绝对没有见过的，这种昆虫都带毒菌。
    他们在投下带菌昆虫时，通常还投下宣传传单，在前线上则发射宣传弹。在平壤中央区也是这样。结果，在平壤市南门里二区六班，有三个人，六十八岁的韩成国和他的两个孙子（一个六岁、一个两岁）死于霍乱。那个地区当时还没有来得及采取防疫措施。到三月十九日为止，在平壤因为传染病而死的人只有这三个人。
    毒虫大半是在夜间或阴天由飞机投下的。飞机都飞得很低。包藏带菌昆虫的容器有纸包，如三月五日投在平壤中区的；传单弹如二月二十七日投在孔洞（译音）村的；胶塑容器，有时是由特制的飞机直接撒布的，如投在开城附近的小村竹洞（译音）的。美军似乎想尽一切办法在河流、小溪、池塘和泉水里面或附近撒布毒虫，特别是带有霍乱菌的毒虫，例如他们曾在二月二十七日在离平壤二十公里的首都水源大同江附近的新龙里（译音）撒布这种毒虫。
    有些带菌昆虫落下以后就冻死了，但是有许多还活着——那是经过特别培养的极其耐寒的昆虫。在大多数苍蝇被烧死以后十天，我们亲眼看见冰上还有一些活苍蝇。我们看到有些苍蝇在落下以后几小时就能飞。全国各地的证人所谈到的带菌昆虫在被发现以后表现的习性都极相似。例如苍蝇在开头几小时通常是昏昏沉沉的，但是随后就能飞离地面一公尺左右，再过几小时就能飞加倍的高，随后就开始散开了。
    毫无疑问，美国想利用天气渐暖的因素，使人们以为传染病是天然发生的。他们在夜间和阴天撒布毒虫，并利用表面上看来和通常的宣传武器没有分别的武器来撒布毒虫，企图借此掩饰他们的罪证。这种武器比任何其他武器都更为毒辣。美国指望受害人为了自卫而不得不毁灭证据。但他们这种规避手段是不会成功的，因为有成千成万的证人，有朝鲜从来没有过的、实验室制造出来的非本地种的昆虫和细菌，有大量无可置辩的完全确凿的证据。我们是习惯于处理事实的记者，我们必须相信我们亲眼看见和亲耳听见的证据，而不是相信艾奇逊和李奇微的话。
    我们不仅看到了美国的细菌进攻，而且看到对这个进攻进行的巨大而胜利的斗争。就像过去常常发生的情况那样，美国完全低估了朝中人民的力量。全国人民和军队马上动员起来对这个新的威胁进行斗争。政府下令全体军民一律进行注射，朝鲜北部差不多每一方公尺的地方都经过清扫，经过防疫委员会与防疫小组的检查。人民不是逃开小小的人造的瘟疫地点，让它们扩大。他们完全相信他们自己政府的措施，他们在苏联和人民民主国家的医药援助下，留下来进行斗争。目前可以说，美国用这种方法所杀死的人比用同等数目的飞机以普通炸弹杀死的人不知道少多少。我们知道，过分详细叙述对付细菌战的方法以及美国所使用的各种方法的相对效力，能够帮助罪犯改进他们的方法。但我们可以说，朝鲜北部的每一个男女和儿童现在都知道这种新武器，并知道如何对付它。人民和政府现在已经拿出一切力量来对付它，因此，过去和现在都没有发生任何流行病。
    美国空军已把朝鲜变为废墟，世界历史上没有任何其他国家像它这样。朝鲜人民的生活条件是极端困难的。但他们不顾一切困难，万众一心地奋起对这个新式的进攻进行斗争。尽管他们的生活条件很不好，鼠疫和霍乱并未能传布。
    我们认为，这是反对战争、争取和平的斗争中的一个在历史上和国际上具有惊人的重要性的事实。
    以上就是我们对遭受细菌进攻的主要地区进行数周的调查后所简单叙述的结论。
    我们始终在采访停战谈判的新闻，我们相信，这个进攻是在世界舆论要求迅速完成板门店谈判的紧要关头企图继续和扩大朝鲜战争的最后挣扎。美国未能靠武力打回中国，它现在希望用在整个东方散布传染病的办法迫使亚洲各国人民屈服。他们希望吓倒正在为争取自由而斗争的其他国家的亚洲人民。他们想要在朝鲜停战协定签字前完成这个实验。
    我们这些记者，看到过华沙遭受毁灭，报道过美国在广岛使用的大规模屠杀的恐怖武器，曾居住在遭到摧残的布达佩斯，经历过日本占领中国时期的恐怖，参加过保卫伦敦不受纳粹空军轰炸的工作，现在我们看到美国空军毁灭朝鲜。我们有权利和义务吁请全世界有良心的人要求停止这种包含着毁灭世界各民族的种子的、新的反对人类的恐怖罪行，并要求惩办应对此事负责的罪犯。
