    The national liberation movement of the people of colonial countries and dependencies
    ——Editorial of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, No. 134
    The people of colonial countries and dependencies are unwilling and unable to continue living under the chains of imperialist enslavement in the old way. Millions of people are engaged in selfless and heroic struggles against colonial oppression and for freedom and independence. The crisis of the imperialist colonial system, which is built on plunder, trampling on human rights, ruthless exploitation, and wanton massacres, has reached an unprecedentedly acute point.

    The vast scale of the national liberation struggles of the people of colonial countries and dependencies is a characteristic of the current international situation. This struggle is ironclad proof that the imperialist colonial system is in the process of collapsing.

    The powerful national liberation movement has spread to all Asian colonies and is growing in scale; in the Near East and Middle East, in Africa and Latin America, it is flourishing day by day.

    The Soviet army shattered fascist Germany and imperialist Japan in World War II, further weakening the imperialist camp, and further promoting the revolutionary struggle of the working class and the anti-imperialist national liberation movement. In some countries of Central and Southeastern Europe, people's democratic systems have been established. In Asia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have stood up. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people defeated the reactionaries and achieved a great victory in the people's revolution. As a result, China split from the imperialist system.

    The historic victory of the Chinese People's Revolution is another victory for Marxism-Leninism, another victory for the Leninist-Stalinist strategy and tactics, and a powerful blow to the entire system of world imperialism and the predatory plans of Anglo-American aggressors. It marks a new stage in the history of the liberation struggle of all oppressed nations.

    As early as 1927, Comrade Stalin wrote:

    "The era of peacefully exploiting and peacefully oppressing the colonies and dependencies has passed.

    The era of revolution for the liberation of colonies and dependencies, the era of the awakening of the proletariat in these countries, the era of its leading role in the revolution has begun."

    These words of Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the working people of the world, profoundly demonstrate that the national liberation movement in colonial countries and dependencies is powerful and irresistible. Everywhere in the world, the working class, under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, stands at the forefront of the people against imperialism and for national liberation, and moves forward.

    The colonial working class forms a close alliance with the peasantry to fight for the cause of liberation. Workers and peasants constitute the vast majority of the population of colonial countries and dependencies; they are the main force of the national liberation movement. The worker-peasant alliance also includes intellectuals, all progressive strata in urban and rural areas, and patriotic elements of the national bourgeoisie.

    The struggle of the Chinese people provides a brilliant example of how to achieve a united front of people's democracy. The Chinese working class and the Chinese Communist Party have become a core, uniting all anti-imperialist and national forces in the country. The Chinese people regard the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party as their leader, as a resolute and unwavering fighter for a new life.

    In different colonial countries and dependencies, the nature of the liberation movement also varies. In some countries, the liberation movement has developed into open armed struggle; in the course of this struggle, regular people's liberation armies and large-scale guerrilla forces have emerged. The people of Vietnam, united with the people of Laos and Cambodia, have fought victoriously against the 200,000-strong expeditionary force of French colonialists for more than six years, and have inflicted serious defeats on this expeditionary force. The people of Malaya, Burma, and the Philippines have taken up arms and are fighting heroically for freedom and independence.

    The Japanese people, who are in dire straits, are also strengthening their struggle to win freedom and independence for their country; their country has been turned into a veritable colony of American imperialists by the American occupiers.

    In India, the Communist Party of India is working to unite all progressive forces in the country to organize a united democratic front in order to establish a people's democratic government. The Communist Party of India is fighting for the sovereignty of the people, for the liberation of the peasants from feudal bondage, and for the improvement of the lives of the working people. The significant victories won by the People's Democratic Front led by the Communist Party in the recent elections demonstrate that the national liberation movement in India has made further progress.

    In the Near East, Middle East, and North Africa, the flames are burning under the feet of the colonizers. Despite the difficulties caused by the collusion between internal reactionaries and imperialist aggressors, the struggle of the masses against the oppression of the colonizers is stronger than ever. They demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Egypt and other countries. The liberation movements in Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon are developing. In Tunisia, the people responded to brutal acts of terror by intensifying their struggle against the French colonialists.

    In an attempt to counter the surging liberation struggles in colonial and semi-colonial countries, the imperialists have resorted to the most despicable means: blackmail, deception, intimidation, firing on marching crowds, and bombing undefended villages and towns. In order to achieve division, in addition to barbaric intimidation, they have added bribery and other conspiracies. In the Near East and Middle East, they sow discord among the people, seeking every means to threaten the national bourgeoisie and divide the national liberation movement.

    In carrying out these vile and dirty tricks, the imperialist reactionaries have found faithful assistants among the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party - a group of apologists who insist that the colonial system is inviolable.

    This just national liberation struggle of the oppressed people has won the warm sympathy and support of the working people of all countries. This struggle is part of the overall battle of the people of all countries against imperialism, against reaction and the camp of war. The Communist Parties in capitalist countries have issued calls to support the national liberation movement with the greatest assistance. Comrade Stalin taught us:

    Unless a real connection is established between their liberation movement and the proletarian movement in the advanced Western countries, it is impossible for the colonial countries and dependencies to achieve final victory.

    The Communist Parties of the metropolitan countries are mobilizing all their forces to fight against the imperialists' expansion of colonial power. Guided by the Leninist-Stalinist doctrine, the glorious French Communist Party bravely proclaims and consistently upholds the right to full self-determination and independence of the people of Vietnam and other countries under French imperialist enslavement. The French working class supports this demand of the Communist Party. Dockworkers in Marseille and Toulon refused to handle weapons destined for Tunisia. The working people of these ports and other ports continue to fight against the Vietnam War.

    The program of the British Communist Party calls for an end to the continued political, economic and military enslavement of the people of colonial countries and dependencies, and demands the complete national independence and equality of these nations; because this is the only basis on which true friendship between nations can be established. The British Communist Party warmly calls on the working class to support the struggle of the people of Egypt and Malaya for independence and to withdraw British troops from these countries.

    The imperialists cannot launch the new war that is currently being prepared against democratic countries unless they first stabilize their rear and suppress "their colonies". The reason why American, British, and French imperialists continue to wage wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya is to try to obtain bases for launching aggression against People's China. The American aggressors are using all their strength to establish a new aggressive alliance in the Middle East, dragging Arab countries into the Atlantic bloc, turning their territories into war bases, and turning their people into cannon fodder for imperialist wars.

    But the oppressed nations are increasingly closely linking their struggle against imperialism and for national liberation with the struggle of the people of all countries to defend and consolidate peace. For example, in Iran, only 500,000 people signed the Stockholm Appeal at that time, but to date, more than two million people have signed the World Peace Council's declaration for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. Fighting Vietnam collected more than 7.5 million signatures for the peace pact. Preparations are also actively underway for convening a conference to defend peace and defend the national independence of the Near East, Middle East, and North African countries.

    The revolutionary struggles waged by the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries are bound to be victorious, because the invincible Leninist-Stalinist doctrine has gained vast ground, because the people of these countries have used the rich revolutionary experience of the Soviet Union, New China, and the People's Democratic countries. To wage an irreconcilable and increasingly fierce struggle to shatter the shackles of imperialism is the path for millions of working people in colonial countries and dependencies to move towards freedom, national independence and peace.

    殖民地国家和附属国人民的民族解放运动
    ——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一三四期社论
    殖民地国家和附属国人民不愿意也不能够再照老样子生活在帝国主义奴役的锁链里了。千百万人民大众正在进行忘我的英勇斗争、反对殖民地压迫，争取自由和独立。帝国主义的殖民制度是建筑在掠夺、蹂躏人权、无情剥削和肆意屠杀上面的，它的危机已经到了空前尖锐的地步。
    殖民地国家和附属国人民的民族解放斗争，其规模之大，是当前国际局势的一个特点。这个斗争铁一般地证明了帝国主义的殖民制度正在崩溃的过程中。
    强大的民族解放运动已经扩展到所有的亚洲殖民地，规模越来越大；在近东和中东，在非洲和拉丁美洲各国，它正在一天一天地蓬勃起来。
    苏联军队在第二次世界大战中粉碎了法西斯德国和帝国主义日本而进一步削弱了帝国主义阵营，进
    一步推动了工人阶级的革命斗争和反对帝国主义的民族解放运动。在中欧和东南欧的一些国家，人民民主制度已经建立起来。在亚洲，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国站起来了。中国人民在共产党的领导之下，打垮了反动派而使伟大的人民革命取得了胜利。结果中国从帝国主义体系当中分裂出去了。
    中国人民革命的历史性胜利是马克思—列宁主义的又一次胜利，是列宁—斯大林的战略和策略的又
    一次胜利，是对于世界帝国主义的整个体系和英美侵略者的掠夺计划一个强有力的打击。在所有被压迫民族解放斗争的历史上，它标志了一个新阶段。
    早在一九二七年，斯大林同志就写道：
    “安然剥削和安然压迫殖民地和附属国的时代已经过去了。
    殖民地和附属国争取解放的革命时代、这些国家的无产阶级觉醒的时代、它在革命中起领导作用的时代已经开始了。”
    世界劳动人民的伟大领袖斯大林同志的这几句话，无比深刻地显示了殖民地国家和附属国民族解放运动是强大的、不可抵抗的。在世界各地，工人阶级在共产党和工人党的领导之下，都站在反对帝国主义、争取民族解放的人民的前列，向前迈进。
    殖民地的工人阶级与农民结成亲密的联盟，为解放事业而奋斗。工人和农民占殖民地国家和附属国人口的绝大多数；他们是民族解放运动的主力。工农联盟也有知识分子参加，有城乡的一切进步阶层参加和民族资产阶级的爱国分子参加。
    在如何实现人民民主统一战线这点上，中国人民的斗争提供了一个光辉的榜样。中国工人阶级和中国共产党已成为一个核心，团结着国内一切反对帝国主义的、民族的势力。中国人民把在共产党领导之下的工人阶级看成为他们的领袖，看成为争取新生活的坚决的、毫不动摇的战士。
    在不同的殖民地国家和附属国内，解放运动的性质也各有分别。有些国家，解放运动已经发展到了公开的武装斗争；在这种斗争的过程中，产生了正规的人民解放军和大规模的游击部队。越南人民与寮国和高棉的人民联合一致，曾经胜利地和法国殖民者的二十万远征军搏战了六年多，并且使这一支远征部队遭受了严重的失败。马来亚、缅甸和菲律宾的人民拿起了武器，正在英勇地为自由和独立而斗争。
    陷入水深火热中的日本人民也正在加强斗争，以争取他们国家的自由和独立；他们的国家已经被美国占领者变成为美国帝国主义者道地的殖民地了。
    在印度，印度共产党正努力团结国内的一切进步力量，组织统一的民主阵线，以便建立人民民主政府。印度共产党为人民的主权、为农民从封建的束缚下解放出来、为劳动人民生活的改善而进行斗争。以共产党为首的人民民主阵线在最近的选举中所获得的显著胜利，证明印度的民族解放运动已有了进一步的发展。
    在近东、中东和北非各国，烈火正在殖民者的脚下燃烧起来。尽管内部的反动派和帝国主义侵略者狼狈为奸，从而产生了一些困难，但是人民群众反对殖民者的压迫的斗争是比从前更加坚强了。他们要求所有的外国军队从埃及和其他国家撤退。伊朗、伊拉克、叙利亚和黎巴嫩的解放运动在发展中。在突尼斯，人民以加强他们反对法国殖民者的斗争来回答了那种残暴的恐怖行动。
    为了力图向殖民地和半殖民地汹涌澎湃的解放斗争进行反击，帝国主义者采取了最卑鄙的手段：讹诈、欺骗、恐吓、向游行的群众开枪、轰炸没有设防的村庄和城镇。为了达到分裂的目的，除施行野蛮的恫吓之外，还加上了贿赂和其他阴谋诡计。在近东和中东，他们在人民中挑拨离间，觅取一切方法来威胁民族资产阶级，分化民族解放运动。
    在进行这种卑劣的肮脏勾当的时候，帝国主义反动派从社会党的右翼领袖们当中找到了忠实的助手——坚持殖民制度是不可侵犯的一群论客们。
    被压迫人民的这种正义的民族解放斗争获得了各国劳动人民热烈的同情和拥护。这种斗争是各国人民反对帝国主义、反对反动和战争阵营的总的战斗中的一部分。资本主义国家的共产党发出号召，以最大的援助支持民族解放运动。斯大林同志教导我们说：
    除非他们的解放运动和先进的西方国家里面的无产阶级运动，二者之间建立起真正的联系，殖民地国家和附属国要获得最后的胜利是不可能的。
    各宗主国家的共产党，正在动员一切力量进行反对帝国主义者扩张殖民势力的斗争。光荣的法国共产党在列宁—斯大林学说的指导下，勇敢地宣称并
    一贯地拥护在法国帝国主义奴役下的越南和其他国家人民的充分自决和独立的权利。法国的工人阶级支持共产党的这一要求。马赛和土伦的码头工人拒绝搬运载往突尼斯的武器。这两个港口和其他港口的劳动人民正继续为反对越南战争而斗争。
    英国共产党的纲领要求终止在政治上、经济上和军事上继续奴役殖民地国家和附属国的人民，要求这些民族的完全的民族独立和平等；因为这是各民族间真正的友谊得以建立的唯一的基础。英国共产党热烈地号召工人阶级来支持埃及和马来亚人民争取独立的斗争，并使英国军队从这些国家撤退。
    帝国主义者如果不首先安定他们的后方并且镇压住“他们的殖民地”，就不能够发动目前正在准备中的反对民主国家的新战争。美国、英国和法国帝国主义者所以要在朝鲜、越南和马来亚继续进行战争，是企图取得基地，向人民中国发动侵略。美国侵略者正以全部力量来建立一个中东的新的侵略同盟，把阿拉伯国家拖进大西洋集团，并把它们的领土变成战争基地，把它们的人民变成帝国主义战争的炮灰。
    但是被压迫的民族把它们反对帝国主义、争取民族解放的斗争和世界各国人民维护与巩固和平的斗争日益紧密地结合起来了。例如，在伊朗，当时在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的只有五十万人，而到今天为止，在世界和平理事会争取缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签名的却超过了两百万。在战斗中的越南为和平公约征集了七百五十多万个签名。召开一个保卫和平以及保卫近东、中东和北非各国民族独立的会议的筹备工作也在积极进行中。
    殖民地和半殖民地人民所进行的革命斗争一定能够取得胜利，这是因为列宁—斯大林的无敌于天下的学说已经得到了广大的阵地，因为这些国家的人民运用了苏联、新中国和人民民主国家的丰富的革命经验。进行不调和的、日益猛烈的斗争，以粉碎帝国主义的枷锁，这就是殖民地国家和附属国的千百万的劳动人民走向自由、民族独立与和平的道路。
