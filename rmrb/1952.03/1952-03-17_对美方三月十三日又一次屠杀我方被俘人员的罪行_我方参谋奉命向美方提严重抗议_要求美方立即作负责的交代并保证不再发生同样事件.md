(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th) The staff officer meeting for the fourth item on the Korean armistice negotiation agenda began today. Our staff officers pointed out at the meeting that our side's proposal of March 5th meant that the fourth item on the agenda should have been reasonably resolved long ago. The other side's principle of "voluntary repatriation" and "no forced repatriation" has been proven to be a completely bankrupt proposition by countless facts in the past few months. Facts have declared to the people of the world that it is a criminal principle. Because the other side insisted on this principle, many of our captured personnel were forcibly consulted by the other side, coerced into accepting the other side's proposition, and shed blood and sacrificed themselves. Now that the other side has proposed to submit it to the staff officer meeting for discussion, if the other side is willing to solve the problem, it should make active efforts and put forward constructive and reasonable suggestions that can solve the problem. At today's staff officer meeting on the fourth item of the agenda, our staff officer was ordered to lodge a serious protest with the other side regarding the bloody massacre of our captured personnel by the other side in the Koje-do prisoner-of-war camp on March 13th (the protest is attached below).
    At the staff officer meeting on the third item of the agenda, the other side agreed to determine the number of designated rear ports to be five, and to remove the clauses on the other side's so-called "deployment and concentration of both sides' forces" from the draft. Our side agreed not to inspect the classified design and characteristics of weapons and ammunition entering Korea, provided that the neutral nations inspection teams could guarantee that the weapons and ammunition entering Korea were not reinforcements, and to add the word "Korea" to Articles 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the draft agreement. The only obstacle to reaching a full agreement at the current staff officer meeting on the third item of the agenda is the other side's unreasonable opposition to our side's nomination, which is completely in line with the definition of a neutral nation. Our side once again proposed that in order to quickly resolve this issue, the other side should withdraw its opposition to our side's nomination of a neutral nation.

    对美方三月十三日又一次屠杀我方被俘人员的罪行
    我方参谋奉命向美方提严重抗议
    要求美方立即作负责的交代并保证不再发生同样事件
    【新华社开城十六日电】朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程参谋会议今天开始。我方参谋人员在会上指出我方提出三月五日建议，第四项议程早应获得合理的解决，对方的“自愿遣返”、“不得强迫遣返”的原则，在过去几个月中已由无数事实证明是完全破产的主张，事实已向全世界人民宣布了它是一个罪恶的原则。由于对方坚持这一原则，多少我方被俘人员被对方强迫征求意见，胁迫他们接受对方的主张而流血牺牲了。现在对方既然提议交到参谋会议来商讨，如果对方愿意解决问题即应作积极的努力，提出能够解决问题的建设性的合理建议。在今天的第四项议程参谋会议上，我方参谋奉命向对方就三月十三日对方在巨济岛战俘营内对我方被俘人员的又一次血腥屠杀事件提出严重抗议（抗议见后）。
    第三项议程参谋会议上，对方同意将特定后方口岸的数目确定为五个，并将对方所提出的所谓“双方部队部署与集中”问题的条款自草案中取消。我方同意在中立国视察小组确能保证进入朝鲜的武器弹药并非增援性的条件下，不检查进入朝鲜的武器弹药的机密设计与特性及在协定草案十三款、十四款、十五款及十六款中增添“朝鲜”的字样。目前第三项议程参谋会议达成全部协议的唯一障碍在于对方无理反对我方完全合乎中立国定义的提名。我方再次提出为迅速解决这一问题，对方应撤回对我方中立国提名的反对。
