    Introducing Methods to Prevent Bovine Foot-and-Mouth Disease
    Last winter, bovine foot-and-mouth disease occurred in many places, but in our village, under the suggestion of labor model Ma Yiqian, a village-wide epidemic prevention committee was organized to lead the masses in preventing the occurrence of bovine foot-and-mouth disease. Our village's epidemic prevention is divided into indoor and outdoor methods: For indoor methods, cattle are fed semi-cooked feed every day, given clean water to drink, manure and urine are removed regularly every day, dry sand and lime powder are sprinkled in the pen, and the cattle pen is kept clean at all times. In outdoor pastures, strict isolation from cattle in other villages is essential, avoiding mixing with cattle from other villages for grazing to eliminate sources of infection. Our village's epidemic prevention committee also conducts household inspections every three days to ensure that epidemic prevention work is done well. As a result, all thirty-five cattle in the village have not been infected with foot-and-mouth disease from last winter until now.

    介绍防止牛口蹄疫的办法
    去年冬天，不少地方发生了牛口蹄疫，但是我村在劳动模范马益谦的提议下，组织了全村防疫委员会，领导群众防止了牛口蹄疫的发生。我村防疫分室内和野外两种办法：室内办法，每天喂牛要喂半熟料，饮清洁水，每天按时清除粪尿，在圈内撒干沙土和石灰粉，经常保持牛圈清洁。在野外牧场必须和外村的牛严格隔离，不和外村的牛混同在一起吃，杜绝传染来源。我村防疫委员会并每三天逐户检查一次，保证把防疫工作作好。因此，全村三十五头牛，从去年冬天到现在，都没有染上口蹄疫。
