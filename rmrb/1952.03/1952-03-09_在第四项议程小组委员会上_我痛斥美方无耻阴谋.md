Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th—To resolve the remaining fundamental disagreement, the Subcommittee on Agenda Item Four reconvened on February 29th. In the initial five days after the resumption, the other side consistently adopted delaying tactics to avoid discussing ways to resolve the fundamental disagreement. In order to seek a solution, our side proposed a reasonable suggestion on March 5th to first determine the principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war based on already agreed or confirmed POW materials. Four days have passed since our side put forward the proposal, and the other side has been avoiding discussing our proposal on the one hand, while continuing to insist on its so-called "voluntary repatriation," which has long gone bankrupt, refusing to resolve the issue quickly and rationally. At today's meeting, our representative once again denounced the other side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" and listed various conspiracies and instigations carried out by the other side within its POW camps, in collusion with the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, in order to achieve the real purpose of its so-called "voluntary repatriation," even causing the recent Geoje Island incident. Our representative solemnly pointed out that the other side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" is actually nothing more than the forced threat of detention and massacre of our captured personnel. Our side will never accept this kind of proposition, and our side will never tolerate this kind of behavior.

    At the Third Agenda Staff Meeting, the two sides continued to discuss the wording of relevant articles in the armistice agreement.

    在第四项议程小组委员会上
    我痛斥美方无耻阴谋
    【新华社开城八日电】为了解决剩下的唯一基本分歧，第四项议程小组委员会在二月二十九日复会，复会后的最初五天里，对方始终采取节外生枝的办法，躲开讨论解决基本分歧的办法。我方为了求取解决问题，在三月五日提出了合理的建议，以已经协议或已经确定的战俘材料为基础，首先确定释放和遣返全部战俘的原则。我方建议提出后已经四天，对方一面避免讨论我方的提案，一面继续坚持其早已破产的所谓“自愿遣返”，拒绝迅速合理解决问题。我方代表在今天的会上，再一次痛斥对方的所谓“自愿遣返”，并列举对方为了达到其所谓“自愿遣返”的真正目的，在其战俘营内勾结李承晚、蒋介石匪帮分子进行种种阴谋策动，甚至造成最近的巨济岛事件。我方代表严正指出对方的所谓“自愿遣返”，实际只是对于我方被俘人员的强迫威胁扣留与屠杀，这种主张我方绝不能接受，这种行为我方绝不能容忍。
    第三项议程参谋会议上，双方对于停战协定中有关条文措辞部分，继续进行讨论。
