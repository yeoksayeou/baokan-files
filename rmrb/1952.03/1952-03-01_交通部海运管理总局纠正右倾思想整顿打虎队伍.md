    The Ministry of Transportation's Maritime Administration Corrects Rightist Ideology and Rectifies the Tiger-Hunting Team

    To the Editor: Since the People's Daily published the editorial "Overcome Rightist Ideology and Strive for a Thorough Victory in the Anti-Corruption Struggle" on February 16th, the Anti-Corruption Headquarters of the Ministry of Transportation's Maritime Administration immediately examined the rightist thinking among its leadership and rectified its ranks. It required all staff members to engage in criticism and self-criticism of rightist ideology. The reviews revealed that many people had serious rightist ideas. In the Finance Section, some even sympathized with the major embezzler Zhao Yiqi. When Zhao was fiercely attacked by the masses at the meeting, he pretended to cry, and afterwards, many people went to comfort him, thinking the masses were a bit "excessive." A large portion of the people in the Port Authority still held an indifferent attitude towards the anti-corruption movement. For example, Yang Weicheng said in his review: "In the past, I thought that since I was neither a corrupt element nor a leading cadre, I would just stand aside and watch the anti-corruption movement." Now, everyone has criticized their own rightist ideas, recognized the harm of rightist ideology, and expressed their determination to strengthen their fighting will in the next stage of encircling and suppressing the "big tigers."
                                                                                                                      Liang Wen

    交通部海运管理总局纠正右倾思想整顿打虎队伍
    编辑同志：自从二月十六日人民日报发表了“克服右倾思想，争取反贪污斗争的彻底胜利”社论以后，中央人民政府交通部海运管理总局反贪污指挥部，立即检查了领导方面的右倾思想，并整顿了队伍，要求全局工作人员展开对右倾思想的批评和自我批评。从大家的检讨中，证明了很多人有严重的右倾思想。财务科竟有人同情大贪污犯赵益祺。赵在大会上被群众的火力攻得假装哭起来，会后就有很多人去安慰他，认为群众有点“过火”。港务处还有很大一部分人对反贪污运动抱着漠不关心的态度，如杨维诚在检讨时说：“过去我想自己既不是贪污分子，又不是领导干部，就站在旁边看反贪污运动。”现在，大家批判了自己的右倾思想，认识了右倾思想的危害性，都表示要加强斗争意志，在下一阶段围剿“大老虎”。  梁文
