    We Don't Need This Kind of "Talent"
    Yuè Dé'ān
    Everyone knows very well that in the near future, a large-scale construction, unprecedented in scale, will unfold on the land of our great motherland. Therefore, a large number of cadres who have mastered modern science and technology are needed to undertake this glorious task. One of the sources of these technical cadres is the students of universities and colleges.

    We also know that these technical personnel must have a high degree of political awareness and a revolutionary outlook on life; otherwise, they cannot take on this responsibility.

    But let's take a look at what kind of ideas some of our professors are instilling in their students? Let's see how they are "cultivating" talent?

    Leaving other things aside, let's just take the architecture department of a certain university as an example. Although it cannot be said to represent everything, we can at least see one aspect from it!

    The more important courses in this department are related to design. How do some of our professors treat this course? They don't teach students from a practical standpoint, but from some kind of "American standard," openly demanding that everyone be original and innovative. Of course, we are not against creation, but we do not need those illusory designs.

    Once, a professor asked the students to design a school gate. Everyone, based on the current national economic conditions and in the spirit of seeking truth from facts, designed a simple and unadorned school gate. Who knew that when the professor saw it, he said, "If four pillars and two iron gates can be considered a school gate, then you can't be considered students of the architecture department!" He also said it was too "vulgar," "crude," and lacking in "taste."

    Since a design that seeks truth from facts is too "vulgar" and lacking in "taste," and since such designers cannot be considered his students, then what kind of design is considered "great" and "magnificent"? What kind of students are considered his outstanding disciples?

    The designs that the professor appreciates are like this: a simple rectangular room with no entire walls, but separated by gloomy oil paintings and half-height walls, with various plaster statues placed on the half-height walls, and a fiery fireplace placed in one corner, with the bed placed between the fireplace and the oil paintings. It is said that this is an embodiment of "one side fiery, one side gloomy, a strong contrast of contradictory psychology." A student designed such a bedroom: the roof peaked at thirty degrees and received praise from the teacher, who said that this was "imaginative" and full of "taste."

    The professor's "outstanding disciples" are such designers: they propose "taking the toilet as the center" one moment, and say they want to "isolate the living room" the next. It is these students who make other students feel a bit "crazy" who are praised, as the professor said, "I appreciate it very much in my heart, and I really want to give him an 'A' when evaluating the designs!"

    What they are pursuing is not precisely the tastes and standards of the bourgeoisie? Is this not a concrete manifestation of bourgeois ideology poisoning young people?

    Under the "cultivation" of such professors, many students have been poisoned. They not only have strong purely technical viewpoints and individualistic ideas of climbing upwards, but also ideas such as "hedonism" and "profiteering." A student designed a domed room with a large cloakroom facing the incoming guests, a waxed and musical bedroom, with velvet curtains hanging on the walls. Introducing it to people, he said, "The taste is very high, and the owner of this house can quietly engage in writing in the entire 'upstairs system.' When tired, they can go to the balcony to get some air."

    Does the "talent" cultivated in this way have the slightest thing in common with the cadres we require who have both ability and integrity and are healthy in body and mind with communist consciousness?

    Also, our professors often talk about how good America is. Once, he told a story saying, "There is an architectural authority in America who, seeing a fruit dish supported by one foot, can't it also be stable and balanced? So he designed a building with a glass mushroom dome, which has now become a scenic spot in America." Under the influence of this "story," many students, in order to become famous, desperately looked for "inspiration," going crazy all day long, making the other students uneasy day and night!

    The technical cadres we want must be people who can closely connect with the masses and work conscientiously and realistically; we do not need these "talents" who lock themselves in a narrow cage.

    我们不需要这样的“人才”
    岳德安
    每一个人都很清楚地知道，在不久的将来，在我们伟大的祖国的土地上，要展开一个空前的大规模的建设。因此，就需要大批掌握现代科学技术的干部，来担当起这个光荣的任务。这种技术干部的来源之一，就是高等学校的学生。
    我们也知道，这些技术人员，必须具有高度的政治觉悟和革命的人生观，否则就不可能负起这个责任。
    可是，让我们来看一看，我们某些教授灌输给学生的是什么思想？看一看他们是在怎样地“培养”人才？
    别的不讲，只拿某大学的建筑系来说吧，虽然不敢说能代表全面，至少可以由此见到一斑！
    这个系比较重要的课程是有关设计方面的，我们的某些教授是怎样地对待这门课程的呢？他们教学生不是从实际出发，而是从什么“美国标准”出发，公开地要求大家标新立异。自然，我们不反对创造，但是，那些虚无缥缈的设计，我们是不需要的。
    有一回，教授要同学们设计校门。大家便根据目前的国家经济条件，本着实事求是的精神，设计了一个简单、朴素的校门。谁知给教授一看，他却说：“如果四个柱子，两扇铁门就算是校门的话，那你就算不得建筑系的学生！”并且说这太“庸俗”、“简陋”，太没“趣味”。
    既然实事求是的设计太“庸俗”，太没“趣味”；既然这样的设计者算不得他的学生；那么，什么样的设计才算“伟大”、“壮丽”呢？什么样的学生，才算是他的高足呢？
    教授所赞赏的设计是这样的：一个简单的长方形的屋子里，没有整幅的墙，而用情调阴森的油画和半截矮墙隔断，矮墙上置各种石膏像，在一个角落里放一火热的壁炉，把床放在炉子和油画之间。据说这是“一边火热，一边阴森，强烈对比的矛盾心理”的体现。有个同学设计了这样的卧室：屋顶尖到三十度，而得到先生的赞扬，说这才是“富有想像力”，富有“趣味”的设计。
    教授的“高足”就是这样的设计者：他们一会儿提出“以厕所为中心”，一会儿说要“孤立起居室”。就是这些使同学们感到有点“疯狂”的学生，受到赞扬，正如教授所说：“我心里很欣赏，评图时很想给他个‘A’”！
    他们所追求的，不正是资产阶级的趣味和标准吗？这不是资产阶级思想毒害青年的具体表现吗？
    在这样的教授“培养”下，很多同学中了毒，他们不仅有浓厚的纯技术观点，向上爬的个人主义；而且有“享乐至上”，“唯利是图”等等的思想。某同学设计了一个圆顶居室：有很大的衣帽间正迎着进来的客人；有打着腊和奏着音乐的卧室，墙上挂着丝绒帷幕。这样，他向人介绍说：“趣味是很大的，这屋的主人可以安静地在整个‘楼上系统’里从事著作，累了，可以到阳台上透透气。”
    这样地培养出来的“人才”，和我们所要求的德才兼备、体魄健全具有共产主义觉悟的干部，有丝毫相同之处吗？
    还有，我们的教授经常说美国如何如何。有一次，他讲了一个故事说：“美国有个建筑权威，看见一只脚支持着的水果盘子，不是也能稳定平衡吗？于是他就设计了一座具有玻璃蘑菇顶的大厦，现在在美国成为名胜了。”在这个“故事”影响下，有不少同学为了成名，就拚命地找“灵感”，整天疯疯癫癫，弄得同学昼夜不安！
    我们所要的技术干部，必须是能够和群众紧密连系在一起，实事求是地认真地工作的人；我们并不需要这些把自己关在狭小的笼子里的“人才”。
