Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 6th: On the eve of the "March 8th" International Women's Day, female medical workers in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front held symposiums. They unanimously stated: they are determined to commemorate this year's "March 8th" Women's Day with practical actions to crush the germ warfare launched by U.S. imperialism. At these symposiums, female medical workers expressed great indignation at the shameless acts of the American aggressors in spreading bacteria and poisonous insects on a large scale on the Korean front and in the rear. Jiang Shuhua, a "model nurse" who returned to China last year to participate in the National Day celebration, said: "U.S. imperialism wants to use the vicious means of spreading bacteria and poisonous insects to kill our soldiers and people. We will never allow it! I will resolutely stand at the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare!" Yu Wenqing, a female nurse in the first team of a certain field hospital, bravely rescued seven wounded soldiers at the risk of enemy bombing and strafing, and was wounded in two places herself, and therefore made great contributions. She said angrily: "American war criminals use such vicious weapons to kill our soldiers. We must find more ways to eliminate the bacteria spread by the enemy and protect the health of the soldiers." Liu Fengxian, a nurse of the "Model Nursing Class" in a certain local hospital, said: "In the year from last year's 'March 8th' to now, U.S. imperialism has used various conspiracies and tricks in Korea, but they have all been慘 defeated in front of our Korean and Chinese armies. This time, they have lost all conscience and used germ weapons to achieve their goals of aggression. Obviously, the enemy cannot save their failure by using any poisonous tricks." Cong Peixiu, a meritorious model of the third medical detachment of a certain unit, expressed her determination at the symposium, saying: "We female medical workers in Korea must use the victory of eliminating bacteria and poisonous insects and thoroughly crushing the enemy's germ warfare to commemorate 'March 8th'!" Many female medical workers have already formulated their own plans and resolutions to participate in the anti-bacterial warfare, and their slogan is: Fight resolutely to defeat U.S. imperialism's germ warfare!

    志愿军女医务工作者
    决心粉碎美军细菌战
    【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】“三八”国际妇女节前，在朝鲜前线中国人民志愿军中的女医务工作者们纷纷举行座谈会。她们一致表示：决以粉碎美帝国主义发动的细菌战争的实际行动，来纪念今年的“三八”妇女节。在这些座谈会上，女医务工作者们对美国侵略者在朝鲜前线和后方大规模撒布细菌毒虫的无耻行为，表示极大的愤怒。曾在去年归国参加国庆节典礼的“模范护士”姜淑华说：“美帝国主义想用撒布细菌毒虫的毒辣手段来杀害我们的战士和人民，我们决不容许它！我要坚决站在反细菌战斗争的最前线！”某野战医院第一队的女护士于文卿曾冒着敌机轰炸扫射，英勇抢救出七个伤员，自己负伤两处，因而立了大功。她愤恨地说：“美国战争罪犯们使用这样毒辣的武器来杀害我们的战士，我们要多想办法来扑灭敌人撒布的细菌，保卫战士的健康。”某地医院“模范护理班”的护理员刘凤仙说：“从去年‘三八’节到现在的一年中，美帝国主义在朝鲜施用了各种阴谋毒计，但都在我们朝中军队面前遭到了惨败。这一次他们竟丧尽天良地用细菌武器来达到侵略的目的，显然，敌人使用任何毒计都不能挽救他们的失败。”某部第三医疗大队大功功臣丛培秀在座谈会上表达自己的决心说：“我们在朝鲜的女医务工作者要用扑灭细菌毒虫，彻底粉碎敌人的细菌战的胜利，来纪念‘三八’节！”许多女医务工作者已经订出了自己参加反细菌战斗争的立功计划和决心书，她们提出的口号是：为战胜美帝国主义的细菌战而坚决斗争！
