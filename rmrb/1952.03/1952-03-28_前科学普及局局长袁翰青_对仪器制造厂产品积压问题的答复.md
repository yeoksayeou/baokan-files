Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editor: The opinion raised by Comrade Jin Zhao, a reader of the People's Daily, regarding the issue of product backlog at the Instrument Manufacturing Factory is basically correct. The former Science Popularization Bureau's leadership of the factory was indeed very inadequate, guided at the time by a mindset of being fond of greatness and eager for success. The former Administrative Office of the Central Ministry of Culture also wanted to run this factory as a profit-making enterprise, which resulted in the errors of blind production and product backlog.

    After the Science Popularization Bureau took over the Instrument Manufacturing Factory, it assigned the factory the task of producing fifty sets of middle school instruments. However, these products could not be sold for a while. Considering that manufacturing instruments for teaching purposes was not the task of the Ministry of Culture, while developing slide projector work was an important task, it was decided to have the factory switch to manufacturing slide projectors. At that time, it was estimated that trade unions and troops across the country needed one to two thousand slide projectors, so it was decided that the factory would manufacture five hundred in 1950. However, after they were manufactured, they were not sold. The Science Popularization Bureau failed to understand the overall situation and assigned tasks, committing a serious error of bureaucracy. This is something that the leading comrades of the former Science Popularization Bureau should examine.

    Before the Central Ministry of Culture took over the factory, the Central Ministry of Education had wanted to take it over. However, the former Science Popularization Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture competed to take it over. But instrument manufacturing is not in line with the tasks of the Ministry of Culture, which led to later mistakes. This is something that should be deeply examined. It is hoped that the new leading body of the factory—the Social and Cultural Affairs Administration—will accept the lessons of the past and make a comprehensive consideration of the factory's future direction and tasks.

    前科学普及局局长袁翰青
    对仪器制造厂产品积压问题的答复
    编辑同志：人民日报读者锦钊同志提出的关于仪器制造厂积压产品问题的意见，基本上是正确的。前科学普及局对于该厂的领导确是非常不够的，当时只凭好大喜功的思想来领导他们。前中央文化部行政处又想把这个厂当作可以赚钱的企业来办，因此就产生了盲目生产、积压产品的错误。
    科学普及局接管仪器制造厂后，曾经给该厂分配了生产五十套中学仪器的任务。但这批产品，一时销不出去。鉴于制造教学上用的仪器，并不是文化部的任务，而发展幻灯工作，却是文化部的重要任务，因此，即令该厂改制幻灯机。当时估计各地工会、部队需要幻灯机一、二千架，就决定该厂于一九五零年制造五百架。但制造出来以后，没有销出去。科学普及局未了解全面情况，即布置任务，犯了严重的官僚主义的错误。这是前科学普及局的领导同志应该检讨的。
    在中央文化部没有接管该厂之前，中央教育部曾想加以接管。但前中央文化部科学普及局却争着接管了，但是仪器制造是与文化部的任务不合的，以致造成后来的错误，这是应当深刻检讨的。希望该厂新的领导机构——社会文化事业管理局接受过去的经验教训，对该厂今后的方针和任务，作通盘的考虑。前科学普及局局长  袁翰青
