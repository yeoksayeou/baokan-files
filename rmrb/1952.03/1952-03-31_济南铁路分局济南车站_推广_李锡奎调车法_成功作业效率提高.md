Jinan Railway Bureau Jinan Station

Successfully Promotes "Li Xikui Shunting Method" Improving Operational Efficiency

    During the "Three-Anti" Movement, Jinan Station of the Jinan Railway Bureau successfully promoted the "Li Xikui Shunting Method." The efficiency of shunting operations at the entire station improved, shortening the stay and transfer time of vehicles at the station.

    In December of last year, Jinan Station began to implement the "Li Xikui Shunting Method." A promotion working group was formed, consisting of Bai Yanting (National Railway Labor Model), Dou Kejian (Shandong Province Labor Model), and Jia Quangui (Deputy Director of the Jinan Station Operations Office), who had returned from Shenyang after studying the "Li Xikui Shunting Method." At the beginning of the promotion, shunting personnel generally lacked confidence and also lacked a correct understanding of the "Li Xikui Shunting Method." The Jin Maoling Youth Shunting Team believed that "Li Xikui Shunting Method" was also about kicking cars and coupling cars, with no advanced experience to learn. Linkman Liu Jian thought it was impossible for the Li Xikui shunting team to release seven hooks in five minutes. The promotion working group first established an amateur study class, explaining in detail the characteristics of the "Li Xikui Shunting Method" to the students, mobilizing shunting personnel to conduct on-site experiments and discussions, and focusing on cultivating several youth shunting teams. In mid-January of this year, the Zhao Chuanli Youth Shunting Team tried the continuous release operation method in the "Li Xikui Shunting Method" and created a new record of releasing eight hooks in five minutes. Then the Liu Boxiang Youth Shunting Team tried the distributed dismantling and midway return brake watching operation method in the "Li Xikui Shunting Method," which also shortened the train marshalling time. This initially broke the conservative thinking of some shunting personnel and encouraged their confidence in learning advanced shunting operation methods.

    In the struggle against corruption, all station employees improved their class consciousness and realized the importance of learning advanced working methods. Many shunting personnel began to realize that the efficiency of shunting operations was not improved because of irresponsibility and waste in the operation process; if the "Li Xikui Shunting Method" was learned well, many waste phenomena in the shunting operation process would be eliminated. Some shunting personnel even felt that it was wrong for them to treat advanced operation methods with a perfunctory and resistant attitude in the past. Therefore, when the Jin Maoling Youth Shunting Team took the lead in formulating methods to ensure the thorough implementation of the "Li Xikui Shunting Method" and challenged other shunting teams, the fifteen shunting teams of Jinan Station unanimously responded enthusiastically. At this time, the leading cadres and the promotion team promptly promoted it. As a result, each shunting team learned to master and use fourteen working methods in the "Li Xikui Shunting Method," such as aisle meetings, flexible use of lines, and continuous release methods.

    After the Jinan Station shunting teams comprehensively implemented the "Li Xikui Shunting Method," the illegal marshalling, return hook waste and other phenomena that often occurred in the past were eliminated. The efficiency of shunting operations has been significantly improved. In the past, it took one to two hours to marshal and uncouple a train; after the Jin Maoling Youth Shunting Team fully utilized the "Li Xikui Shunting Method," it only took eighteen minutes. The time for marshalling and uncoupling trains at the entire station was shortened by an average of twelve minutes per train. The time for vehicles to stay and transfer at the station has also been greatly shortened. In February, the vehicle stay time at this station was shortened by 62 percent compared with December last year, and the vehicle transfer time was shortened by 26 percent compared with December last year. The train operation was all on time, and no accidents of any kind occurred during the entire month. The shortening of vehicle stay and transfer time in February alone added more than 172 million yuan of wealth to the country. (People's Railway News)

    济南铁路分局济南车站
    推广“李锡奎调车法”成功作业效率提高
    济南铁路分局济南车站在“三反”运动中，推广“李锡奎调车法”成功。全站调车作业效率提高，缩短了车辆在站的停留、中转时间。
    去年十二月间，济南站开始推行“李锡奎调车法”。由从沈阳学习“李锡奎调车法”回来的白延廷（全国铁路劳动模范）、窦克俭（山东省劳动模范）、贾全贵（济南站运转室副主任）等组成推广工作组。开始推行时，调车人员普遍缺乏信心，同时对“李锡奎调车法”缺乏正确的认识。金茂岭青年调车组认为：“李锡奎调车法”也是甩车，挂车，没有什么先进经验可学。连结员刘键认为：李锡奎调车组五分钟溜放七钩是不可能的事。推广工作组首先成立业余学习班，向学员详细地介绍、解释“李锡奎调车法”的特点，发动调车人员进行实地试验和讨论，并以几个青年调车组为重点进行培养。今年一月中旬，赵传礼青年调车组试用“李锡奎调车法”中的连续溜放作业法，创造出五分钟溜放八钩的新纪录。接着刘伯祥青年调车组试用
    “李锡奎调车法”中的分布解体及中途折返看闸作业法，也缩短了编车时间。这样，便初步打破了某些调车人员中的保守思想，并鼓舞了他们学习先进调车作业法的信心。
    在反贪污斗争中，全站职工都提高了阶级觉悟，认识到学习先进工作法的重要。许多调车人员开始认识到：调车作业效率提不高，是因为在作业过程中有不负责任和浪费的现象；把“李锡奎调车法”学好，就会消灭调车作业过程中的许多浪费现象。有的调车人员更感到自己已往用敷衍抗拒的态度来对待先进作业法是不对的。因此，当金茂岭青年调车组带头订出保证彻底推行“李锡奎调车法”的办法，并向其他调车组提出挑战时，济南站十五个调车组一致热烈应战。这时，领导干部和推广组便及时加以推动。结果，各调车组都学会了掌握运用“李锡奎调车法”中的走道会议、活用线路、连续溜放法等十四种工作方法。
    济南站各调车组全面推行“李锡奎调车法”后，过去工作中经常发生的违法编组、返钩浪费等现象都消灭了。调车作业效率显著提高。过去，编组、解结一列车需要一小时到二小时；金茂岭青年调车组充分运用“李锡奎调车法”后，只需要十八分钟。全站编解列车时间，平均每列车缩短了十二分钟。车辆在站停留、中转的时间也大为缩短。二月份这个车站车辆在站停留时间比去年十二月缩短了百分之六十二，车辆中转时间比去年十二月缩短了百分之二十六，列车运行全部正点，并且全月没有发生任何责任事故。仅二月份车辆停留和中转时间的缩短，就为国家增加了一亿七千二百余万元的财富。（人民铁道报）
