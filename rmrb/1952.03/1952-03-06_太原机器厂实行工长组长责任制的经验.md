The Experience of Taiyuan Machine Factory in Implementing the System of Foremen and Group Leaders' Responsibility
Liu Qinxue, Labor Model of Taiyuan Machine Factory

The system of foremen and group leaders' responsibility implemented by Taiyuan Machine Factory has played a significant role in production management. The Taiyuan City Labor Model Conference held last November considered this one of the better production management systems. Why can this system have such a significant impact on production management? The main reason is that it embodies the correct view that relying on the working class to improve production must be based on experienced technical workers as the backbone.

Taiyuan Machine Factory has about one hundred foremen and group leaders, all of whom are experienced in operation and are the most adept at using the original equipment old technical workers. Before the implementation of the foremen and group leaders' responsibility system last June, we did not reasonably use these experienced technical workers. Therefore, their strength was not well brought into play. At that time, the foremen were leaving their respective work sections to work in the workshop director's office, without going deep into the work sections to provide specific guidance. Because the foremen were not on-site, the vast majority of group leaders were caught up in administrative work such as attending meetings, writing work orders, receiving tasks, and delivering goods, and did not participate in direct production. In the first half of May last year, out of thirteen days, some group leaders' daily work reports had "miscellaneous duties" written on them for seven days. This deprived the production team of its main backbone, resulting in chaotic production order, problems that could not be solved in a timely manner, and lax labor discipline, which directly affected the quantity and quality of products. For example, in May last year, the entire factory only completed two-thirds of its production tasks, which was closely related to the working conditions of the foremen and group leaders at that time. The steelmaking department ruined seven heats of alloy steel in one month, two of which were ruined because the foremen and group leaders were not personally responsible. These two heats of steel alone cost the factory 67 million yuan. The workers were very dissatisfied with this situation, saying, "The production group leaders don't produce, they just issue orders downwards." They hoped for a swift change.

In response to this situation, starting from June last year, through publicity and mobilization, we gradually implemented the system of foremen and group leaders' responsibility, changing the way these experienced technical workers were used, and concentrating their strength on production. The following was clearly stipulated: (1) Foremen are not allowed to work in the workshop director's office under any circumstances and must work in their respective work sections. The foreman's tasks are clearly defined into three items: first, to ensure that the work section completes the task on time with qualified quality; second, to be responsible for the task allocation, labor organization, and technical guidance of the work section; third, to inspect and supervise the implementation of labor discipline, production procedures, and safety regulations. (2) Group leaders should get rid of administrative work such as reports and forms, get to work, and are not allowed to leave their posts without permission during working hours. (3) In order to ensure the implementation of the above provisions, staff members should go to the site to do statistics and inspection work.

After the implementation of the system of foremen and group leaders' responsibility, the chaotic situation of no one being responsible for production was quickly reversed. The strength of the experienced technical workers was fully brought into play, and the general workers became more active, saying, "If the master craftsmen are doing it themselves, why shouldn't we!" The apprentices believed that "the group leaders' hands-on work is a good opportunity to learn technology," and they were especially motivated, thus greatly strengthening the combat strength of the workshops. From June last year, the responsibility of the workshops for unfinished products decreased month by month. In May last year, the responsibility of the workshops for unfinished products accounted for 6.25 percent, in June it was 5.2 percent, in July it was 4.75 percent, in August it was 4.16 percent, and in September it was 2.75 percent. The ironwork department often failed to complete the plan in the past. After the implementation of the system of foremen and group leaders' responsibility, for the production of No. 824 products, the original plan was for twelve pieces, but the actual completion was twenty-three pieces, exceeding the quota by nearly one time. The total value of defective products in the entire factory in September last year decreased by 85 percent compared with August, and the defective products in August had already decreased significantly compared with before June. In terms of safety, the machine shop, which had the most complex equipment, had the most accidents in the past. After the implementation of the system of foremen and group leaders' responsibility, no accidents occurred for several months in a row.

    太原机器厂实行工长组长责任制的经验
    太原机器厂劳动模范    刘勤学
    太原机器厂实行的工长、组长责任制，在生产管理上起了很大作用。去年十一月举行的太原市劳动模范大会，认为这是较好的生产管理制度之一。这个制度为什么能够对于生产管理发生重大作用呢？主要是它贯彻了依靠工人阶级搞好生产必须以老技术工人为骨干这个正确观点。
    太原机器厂约有一百名工长和组长，他们都是有丰富操作经验、最善于使用原有设备的老技术工人。去年六月实行工长、组长责任制以前，我们没有合理地使用这些老技术工人。因此，他们的力量没有很好地发挥出来。那时，工长们都是离开自己所管的工段，坐在车间主任办公室办公，不深入工段进行具体指导。组长们因为工长不在现场，绝大多数都陷于开会、写报工单、领活、交货等事务工作中，不参加直接生产。去年五月份上半月十三天中，有的组长的工作日报有七天写着“杂务”工作。这样，就使生产队伍失去了主要骨干，因而发生了生产秩序混乱，有问题不能及时解决，劳动纪律松弛等现象，直接影响到产品的数量和质量。如去年五月份全厂只完成三分之二的生产任务，这和那时工长、组长的工作状况有很大关系。炼钢部一个月炼坏了七炉合金钢，其中有两炉是因为工长、组长没有亲自负责而炼坏的。只这两炉钢就使工厂损失了六千七百万元。工人们对这种状况很不满意，说：“生产组长不生产，发号施令往下传。”希望赶快加以改变。
    针对这种情况，从去年六月开始，我们经过宣传动员，逐步地实行了工长、组长责任制，改变了对这些老技术工人的使用方法，把他们的力量集中地组织到生产中去。明确规定：（一）工长一律不准在车间主任办公室办公，必须在自己所管工段工作。工长的任务明确规定三项：第一，保证所属工段按时完成任务，质量合格；第二，负责所属工段的任务调配、劳力组织、技术指导；第三，检查督促劳动纪律、生产程序、安全制度的执行。（二）组长要摆脱表报等事务工作，下手干活，并且不准在工作时间内擅离职守。（三）为了保证上述规定的实行，职员要到现场去作统计、检查工作。
    工长、组长责任制实行以后，迅速地扭转了生产上无人负责的混乱局面。老技术工人的力量充分发挥出来了，一般的工人也更积极了，他们说：“大工匠都亲自下手干，咱还不干！”学徒们认为“组长们亲自动手正是学习技术的好机会”，劲头也特别大，因此，大大地加强了车间的战斗力量。从去年六月开始，未完成产品中的车间应负责任者，逐月减少了。去年五月份未完成产品中，车间应负责任者占百分之六点二五，六月份为百分之五点二，七月份为百分之四点七五，八月份为百分之四点一六，九月份为百分之二点七五。铁工部以前常常不能完成计划，实行工长、组长责任制后，作八二四号产品，原计划十二件，实际完成了二十三件，超额近一倍。去年九月份全厂的废品总值，比八月份减少了百分之八十五，而八月份的废品已比六月以前减少了很多。在安全方面，设备最复杂的机工部过去事故最多，实行工长、组长责任制后，一连几个月没有发生任何事故。
