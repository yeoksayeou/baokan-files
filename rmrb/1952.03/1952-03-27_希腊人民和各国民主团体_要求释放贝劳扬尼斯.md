    The Greek People and Democratic Groups in Various Countries
    Demand the Release of Beloyannis
    [This newspaper dispatch] A comprehensive Xinhua News Agency report: Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, the Greek royalist-fascist government, in the two weeks from February 16 to March 1, carried out a new persecution plot against Greek Communist leaders and patriots. The Athens Military Tribunal, as usual, based on "indictments" fabricated from "testimony" by police officers and various secret agents, tried twenty-nine patriots who were falsely accused of "espionage." During the trial, Beloyannis, a member of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party, and the female journalist Ioannidou, both of whom were falsely accused, made heroic defenses in court. They sternly refuted the Greek government's slander against the Greek Communist Party, and explained that the Greek Communist Party is a party that struggles unremittingly against foreign aggressors enslaving Greece, and for Greek peace and democracy. However, the Athens court shamelessly sentenced Beloyannis and Ioannidou and six other defendants to death; and sentenced another four defendants to life imprisonment and the other eight defendants to varying prison terms.
    The shameless verdict of the Greek royalist-fascist government against the Greek patriots Beloyannis and Ioannidou and others has once again aroused strong anger among the Greek people. Beloyannis rescue committees are being established in Greek cities and villages. The Greek Left-wing Democratic Alliance issued a public statement on March 4, strongly protesting the shameless verdict of the Greek reactionary government, and demanding the release of the eight patriots.
    The Greek people's struggle to rescue Greek patriots Beloyannis and Ioannidou and others has gained the active support of peace-loving people in various countries around the world. The Soviet Union's acting permanent representative to the United Nations, Tsarapkin, has written to the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Secretariat several times, requesting that, in accordance with the humanitarian guidelines adopted by the third and fourth sessions of the United Nations General Assembly for the protection of victims of political terror in Greece, immediate measures be taken to stop the execution of the eight Greek patriots, including Beloyannis and Ioannidou, who have been sentenced to death, in order to save their lives. The International Committee of Resistance Fighters and Victims of Fascist Persecution and Imprisonment, the Polish Youth League and the Polish Student Union, the Romanian Peace Defense Committee, the National Committee of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front, the Hungarian Trade Union Council, the Italian General Confederation of Labor, and the Belgian branch of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and other democratic groups from various countries have sent telegrams to the Greek government, unanimously protesting its shameless verdict against the Greek patriots, the peace defenders Beloyannis and Ioannidou and others, and demanding their release. The Political Committee of the British Communist Party issued a declaration calling on the British trade union and co-operative movements to support the persecuted Greek patriots. On March 3, four thousand people gathered in New York to protest the Greek government's death sentences and prison terms for Greek patriots; twenty trade union groups, twenty-three progressive organizations, and thirty leaders from the arts, sciences and various other fields in the United States also jointly protested.

    希腊人民和各国民主团体
    要求释放贝劳扬尼斯
    【本报讯】综合新华社消息：在美帝国主义的指使下，希腊保皇法西斯政府从二月十六日到三月一日的两周中，又对希腊共产党领袖和爱国人士进行新的迫害阴谋。雅典军事法庭照例依据由警官和各种密探的“证言”所捏造的“起诉书”，审讯了被诬告犯了“间谍罪”的二十九个爱国者。在审讯中，被诬告的希腊共产党中央委员会委员贝劳扬尼斯和女记者伊奥尼杜等都曾在法庭上作了英勇的答辩，他们严正驳斥了希腊政府对希腊共产党的诬告，并且说明希腊共产党是一个为反对外国侵略者奴役希腊，为希腊和平与民主而奋斗不懈的政党。然而，雅典法庭仍无耻地把贝劳扬尼斯和伊奥尼杜等八名被告判处死刑；并判处另四名被告以无期徒刑、其他八名被告以刑期不等的徒刑。
    希腊保皇法西斯政府对希腊爱国者贝劳扬尼斯和伊奥尼杜等的无耻判决，再度激起希腊人民的强烈愤怒。希腊各城市和乡村正在成立贝劳扬尼斯营救委员会。希腊左翼民主联盟于三月四日发出公报，严重抗议希腊反动政府的无耻判决，要求释放八名爱国者。
    希腊人民营救希腊爱国者贝劳扬尼斯和伊奥尼杜等的斗争，已获得世界各国爱好和平人民的积极支援。苏联驻联合国代理常任代表查拉普金，曾数度写信给联合国大会主席和联合国秘书处，要求根据联合国大会第三、第四届会议为保护希腊恐怖政治下的受难者而采取的人道方针，立刻采取措施，制止处决被判死刑的贝劳扬尼斯和伊奥尼杜等八名希腊爱国者，以拯救他们的生命。抵抗运动战士及受法西斯迫害与囚禁者国际委员会、波兰青年联盟和波兰学生联合会、罗马尼亚保卫和平委员会、保加利亚祖国阵线全国委员会、匈牙利工会理事会、意大利总工会和国际民主法律工作者协会比利时分会等各国民主团体，纷纷致电希腊政府，一致抗议其对希腊爱国者、保卫和平的战士贝劳扬尼斯和伊奥尼杜等的无耻判决，并要求把他们释放。英国共产党政治委员会发表宣言，号召英国的工会与合作者运动声援被迫害的希腊爱国者。三月三日，纽约四千人集会，抗议希腊政府对希腊爱国者宣判死刑和徒刑；美国的二十个工会团体、二十三个进步组织和艺术界、科学界及各业的领袖三十人，也同声提出抗议。
