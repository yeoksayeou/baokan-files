Abstracts of Soviet Newspaper Articles

The Selection and Education of Women Cadres

The Soviet newspaper *Pravda* published an article on February 12th by Aliyeva, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Turkmenistan, on the selection and education of women cadres. The abstract is as follows:

The Soviet regime has destroyed all legal restrictions on women, giving them equal rights with men in all aspects of economic, cultural, and political life. The Bolshevik Party gave working women spiritual inspiration and awakened their great power.

Before the Great October Socialist Revolution, the living conditions of Turkmen women were very difficult. They were deprived of all political and economic rights. Under the Soviet system, the daughters of the Turkmen people have become the full masters of their own destiny. They are participating as actively as men in the construction of communism.

The Party organization of the Turkmen Republic strives to raise the production and political enthusiasm of working women, and is very concerned with promoting them to responsible positions in Party, Soviet, trade union, Communist Youth League, and economic organs. Many women have been elected as secretaries of Party provincial, city, or district committees. The task of further developing and consolidating the national economy and culture requires Party organizations to pay more attention to attracting women to participate in production and social life. Party organizations have a responsibility to more boldly and resolutely promote women to responsible positions.

In the Party organizations' practical work of educating women cadres, the work of the women's committees established in various collective farms, state farms, industrial enterprises, transportation and communication departments, and in various organs occupies an important position. The work of the women's committees is regularly led by the Party organizations, and its main task is to help the Party organizations, enterprises, and collective farm leaders to improve women's labor enthusiasm and attract them to participate in socialist competition. At the same time, Party leading organs at all levels must rely on the Party's grassroots organizations to enhance the grassroots organizations' responsibility for the political education of women.

In completing the task of training women cadres, our Turkmen Party organizations still need to do a lot of work. First, it is necessary to eliminate the phenomenon of some Party workers distrusting women's creativity. We still have some Party committees that groundlessly fear promoting young and promising women activists to leadership positions. Individual Party organizations, after promoting women to leadership positions, forget the need to provide them with systematic assistance.

An Important Task for Newspapers and Magazines

The Soviet newspaper *Pravda* published an editorial on February 13th, proposing that newspaper and magazine editorial departments should pay attention to improving the ideological level of criticism and book reviews. The abstract is as follows:

In our country, books have become the property of the people. In the lives of Soviet people, they are like loyal friends, advisors, or guides to socialist culture. Soviet books instill knowledge in the masses and play an important role in the communist education of the working people.

Our newspapers and magazines play the role of promoters of Soviet books when publishing criticism and book reviews. It guides writers and publishers to create high-quality books and helps readers discover the books they need. Criticism and book reviews are extremely important weapons for propaganda and communist education.

In recent years, although Soviet newspapers and magazines have significantly strengthened criticism and book review work, many newspaper and magazine editorial departments still have serious shortcomings in this area. Many local newspapers and magazines are not good at organizing regular introductory book reviews and rarely comment on locally published books. Articles on the most important literary works are also far from sufficient.

Our newspapers must systematically engage in criticism and book review work. This work should be arranged in such a way that this important department of newspapers and magazines can help improve ideological work, invigorate the work of various creative organizations, improve the ideological, scientific, and artistic level of books, and enhance the role of books in the communist education of the working people.

The most urgent task of the editorial departments of newspapers and magazines at present is to strive to improve the ideological and literary level of criticism and book review articles, concentrate efforts to support and promote all progressive things in literature, and fight against apolitical tendencies and lack of ideology, and oppose all kinds of hostile ideological manifestations.

The editorial departments of newspapers and magazines should follow the policies of the Communist Party, which are the foundation of the Soviet system, when conducting criticism and book review work and evaluating each book. Our literary criticism should be principled, that is, to make in-depth analysis of works and help promote science, literature, and art.

The further improvement of criticism and book reviews will inevitably urgently raise the issue of critics' cadres and the issue of leading and training these cadres. Because social political, artistic, scientific, production technology books, textbooks, and reference books should always be within the sight of newspaper and magazine editorial departments, and special attention should also be paid to the quality of translations and the work of translators. Therefore, the editorial departments of newspapers and magazines can only make appropriate evaluations of various books by relying on countless scientific workers, local writers, the vast number of intellectuals, and writing activists among production innovators.

Criticism and book review is a very important undertaking. Party organizations at all levels should treat this combat department of ideological work with great attention. The responsibility of the Party organizations is to promote the staff of newspaper and magazine editorial departments to strive to improve criticism and book review work and enhance its role in the communist education of the working people.

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    妇女干部的选拔和教育
    苏联真理报二月十二日发表了土库曼斯坦共产党（布）中央委员会书记阿里耶娃所著关于选拔和教育妇女干部的论文。摘要如下：
    苏维埃政权摧毁了对妇女的一切法律限制，在经济、文化和政治生活的各方面，都赋予她们和男子相等的权利。布尔什维克党则给劳动妇女以精神上的鼓舞并唤醒了她们的伟大力量。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命以前，土库曼妇女的生活条件是非常艰苦的。她们被剥夺了各种政治和经济的权利。在苏维埃制度下，土库曼人民的女儿已经成为自己命运的全权主人了。她们和男子同样积极地参加了共产主义的建设工作。
    土库曼共和国的党组织尽力提高劳动妇女的生产和政治积极性，十分关怀提拔她们担任党、苏维埃、工会、共青团和经济机关的负责工作。许多妇女被选为党的省委员会、市委员会或区委员会的书记。进一步发展和巩固国民经济和文化的任务，要求党组织加强注意吸引妇女参加生产和社会生活。党组织有责任更勇敢和更坚决地提拔妇女担任负责工作。
    在党组织教育妇女干部的实际工作中，在各集体农场、国营农场、工业企业、运输和交通部门以及在各机关中所建立的妇女委员会的工作，占有重要地位。妇女委员会的工作，由党组织经常领导，它的任务主要是帮助党组织、企业和集体农场的领导者来提高妇女的劳动积极性，吸引她们参加社会主义竞赛。同时，各级党的领导机关也要依靠着党的基层组织，提高基层组织对于妇女政治教育的责任。
    在完成培养妇女干部的任务方面，我们土库曼的党组织还需要做不少工作。首先必须消除某些党的工作者不信任妇女的创造力的现象。我们还有一些这样的党委会，它们毫无根据地惧怕提拔年青有为的妇女积极分子做领导工作。个别的党组织在把妇女提到领导工作后，又忘记了需要给她们以系统的帮助。
    报纸和杂志的一个重要任务
    苏联真理报二月十三日发表社论，提出报纸和杂志的编辑部应注意提高批评和图书评论的思想水平。摘要如下：
    在我国，书籍已成为人民的财产，它在苏联人的生活中，像是一个忠实的朋友、顾问或社会主义文化的向导者一样。苏联的书籍向群众灌输知识并在劳动人民的共产主义教育中起着重要的作用。
    我们的报刊在发表批评和图书评论的时候，担任着苏联书籍宣传员的角色。它使作家和出版家以创作高等质量的书籍为方针，同时帮助读者发现他们所必需的书籍。批评与图书评论是宣传和进行共产主义教育的极重要的武器。
    近年以来，苏联的报纸和杂志虽已显著地加强了批评和图书评论工作，但仍有很多报纸和杂志的编辑部在这一工作方面存有很多严重缺点。许多地方报纸和杂志不善于组织经常的介绍性的图书评论，对当地出版的书籍很少评述。关于最重要的文学作品的论文，刊载的也远为不够。
    我们的报刊必须系统地从事于批评与图书评论的工作。应该这样来安排这一工作：即使报纸和杂志上的这一重要部门，能够协助改善思想工作，活跃各创作组织的工作，提高书籍的思想、科学和艺术水平，并能提高书籍在劳动人民共产主义教育中的作用。
    目前报纸和杂志的编辑部的最迫切任务就是：尽力提高批评和图书评论论文的思想水平和文学水平，集中力量来支持和宣传文学中的一切进步事物，向不问政治倾向和缺乏思想性进行斗争，反对所有各种敌对思想的表现。
    报纸和杂志的编辑部在进行批评与图书评论的工作和对每一本书作评价时，应当遵从着作为苏维埃制度生存基础的共产党的政策。我们的文学批评应该是有原则性的，即是要对作品做深刻分析并能帮助推进科学、文学和艺术。
    批评与图书评论的进一步改善必然会迫切地引起关于批评家干部、关于领导和培养这些干部的问题。因为社会政治的、艺术的、科学的、生产技术的书籍、教科书以及参考用书，都应该经常在报纸和杂志的编辑部的视野之内，同时对于译文质量和翻译工作者的工作，也需要特别注意。因此，报纸和杂志的编辑部只有依靠无数科学工作者、地方作家、广大知识分子和生产革新者中间的写作积极分子，才能对各种书籍作出适当的评价。
    批评与图书评论是一项非常重要的事业。各地的党组织应当以极大的注意来看待这一思想工作的战斗部门。党组织所负的责任是推动报纸和杂志编辑部的工作人员来尽力改善批评与图书评论工作，提高它在劳动人民共产主义教育中所起的作用。
