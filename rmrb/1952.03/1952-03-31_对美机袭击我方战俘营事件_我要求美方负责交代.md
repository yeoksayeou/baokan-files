    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 30th: At the staff meeting on the third item of the Korean armistice negotiations agenda on March 30th, the other side continued to unreasonably insist on using the word "Korea" in the armistice agreement, and the meeting made no progress.
    At the staff meeting on the fourth item of the agenda, the two sides continued to exchange views on the issue of repatriation principles. After the meeting, our staff notified the other side that the location of our No. 1 prisoner-of-war camp, which we marked for the other side on January 25th, was verified again at the request of the other side yesterday and proved to be accurate. Our staff also demanded that the other side provide a responsible explanation as soon as possible regarding the incident on March 16th, in which their military aircraft attacked our No. 1 prisoner-of-war camp and injured British prisoners.

    对美机袭击我方战俘营事件
    我要求美方负责交代
    【新华社开城三十日电】三月三十日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，对方仍然无理坚持在停战协定中使用“韩国”的字样，会议无进展。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，双方就遣俘原则问题继续交换意见。会后我方参谋通知对方，我方一月二十五日标给对方的我方第一号战俘营的位置，经应对方昨日要求再予查对后，证明正确无误。我方参谋并要求对方对其军用飞机三月十六日袭击我方第一号战俘营并伤及英俘的事件早作负责的交代。
