Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 28th: The International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team has completed its investigation into the crimes of US imperialism in conducting germ warfare in Northeast China. On March 28th, they sent telegrams to the Association's Chairman, Pritt, Dymond, Boulger (UK, London), Vice-Chairmen Jaydin (Soviet Union, Moscow), Shen Junru (People's Republic of China, Beijing), Ioroshsky-Irzhiy (Poland, Warsaw), Derasini (Italy, Rome), and Madame Buffru (Belgium, Brussels), reporting as follows:

At the request of the Secretary-General of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, we investigated the accusations regarding the scattering of bacteria by American aircraft in the northeastern provinces of China. We investigated ten of the many incidents that have occurred since February 29th, these ten incidents covering a large area of ​​Northeast China. The situation found in Northeast China is mostly similar to the situation we investigated in Korea. We particularly noted that the insects found had extraordinary properties and were densely clustered, and in extremely cold climates, they were still found alive on ice and snow. Flies, mosquitoes, fleas, and feathers have been found to carry bacteria or viruses. Fragments of a special container were found. Despite extremely strict quarantine measures, a fatal encephalitis, never before seen in China, has appeared. Expert examinations have proved that the effect of the virus carried by certain artificially infected mosquitoes found in the area where this fatal disease occurred is exactly the same as that of this encephalitis. It has been confirmed that American aircraft appeared in the vicinity of the area where these poisonous insects were found. We believe that the United States is expanding its crimes committed in Korea to the land of a country with which it is not at war, which is an act of aggression by the United States. If this aggression is not exposed and stopped now, it will have extremely serious consequences for world peace.

Shenyang, March 28, 1952

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 28th: After conducting two days of investigation work in Shenyang, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team obtained many conclusive pieces of evidence regarding US imperialism's heinous germ warfare in Northeast China. The team has cabled its report to the International Association of Democratic Lawyers Chairman Pritt and Vice-Chairmen Jaydin, Shen Junru, Ioroshsky-Irzhiy, Derasini, and Madame Buffru. After completing its investigation mission, the team returned to Beijing by car at 2:00 AM on the 28th.

After arriving in Shenyang on the 26th, the investigation team began its investigation work on the same day. Wang Bin, Minister of Health of the Northeast People's Government, and Bai Xiqing, Deputy Minister, presented many pieces of evidence regarding the widespread use of bacteriological weapons by US imperialism in Northeast China and the massacre of the Chinese people. Entomology, bacteriology, and pathology experts who attended to testify included: Chen Shixiang, Director of the Entomology Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wu Zhizhong, Educational Director and Professor of Internal Medicine at China Medical University; Qin Yaoting, Director of the Department of Biology at China Medical University; Li Peilin, Professor and Director of the Department of Pathology at China Medical University; Xu Yingkui, Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at the Peking Union Medical College; Zhang Xuede, Physician of Internal Medicine at the Peking Union Medical College; Zhu Jimin, Chief Technician of the Central Institute of Biological Products; Jing Guanhua, Associate Professor and Acting Director of the Department of Bacteriology at China Medical University; Lu Baolin, Associate Professor of the Department of Entomology at China Agricultural University; and Xin Jun, Chief Technician of the Northeast Infectious Disease Prevention and Treatment Hospital.

Bai Xiqing presented ten cases to the investigation team accusing the US aggressors of conducting germ warfare crimes in Northeast China. In his report, he gave detailed accounts of the time, place, witnesses, and physical evidence of these cases. When the experts testified to the investigation team, they all used accurate and reliable scientific evidence to prove that the large number of abnormal insects currently found in various parts of Northeast China could not possibly have grown under natural conditions at this time and place, and some were never seen locally before. The results of bacterial identification have indeed confirmed that these poisonous insects carry various deadly bacteria. They also gave detailed introductions to the suffering of infected residents in the areas where the US aggressors scattered poisonous insects, based on facts from clinical examinations and pathological autopsies.

On the 27th, the investigation team questioned witnesses from Shenyang, Kuandian, Jinzhou, and other places where bacteria-carrying poisonous insects dropped by American aircraft were discovered. The witnesses who came to testify were: Liu Guangyi, a farmer from Jiuzhan Village in the suburbs of Shenyang City; Chai Yongmian, a residents' group leader; Liu Guanghui, the village head; Sun Jiaxun, a soldier from a certain public security force in Shenyang City; Li Shangping (female), a staff member of an organization; Han Yongbin, the shopkeeper of Tongjuhe Grocery Store in Chengnanmen, Kuandian County; Li Sijian, a first-year student at Kuandian Middle School; and Ren Zanyi, a member of the Jinzhou Epidemic Prevention Team. They were all direct witnesses who personally saw American planes invading Northeast China's airspace and dropping bacteria-containing poisonous insects, or who were the first to discover large numbers of densely packed poisonous insects. When they testified, they all gave detailed accounts of the process of discovering bacteria-containing poisonous insects. Finally, the investigation team invited two responsible persons from the Shenyang People's Air Defense Organization and the Northeast Air Defense Military Organ to attend and testify. Their statements further confirmed that in the area where the poisonous insects were found or in the neighboring area, on the day of the incident or before, American aggressor military aircraft did indeed invade the airspace above the area. During the questioning of witnesses, the investigation team examined the remains of the bacterial bomb dropped by American aircraft that had just been sent from Kuandian. On the same day, they inspected the "Exhibition of Evidence of the Crimes of US Imperialist Germ Warfare," and inspected various physical evidence and photos related to US imperialism's preparation for germ warfare, including documents, bacteria-carrying insects, test results, animal inoculation experiments, and pathological autopsies. After repeated and meticulous examination of the evidence and inquiries, the investigation team has obtained sufficient materials to determine that the US aggressors did indeed send military aircraft to invade China's airspace and carry out heinous germ warfare. On the 28th, the team sent telegrams to the International Association of Democratic Lawyers Chairman Pritt, Vice-Chairmen Jaydin, and others, reporting the investigation results.

After completing two days of intense work and successfully completing its mission, the investigation team returned to Beijing by car at 2:00 AM on the 28th. Wang Bin, Minister of Health of the Northeast People's Government, Bai Xiqing, Deputy Minister, and Jiao Ruoyu, Deputy Mayor of Shenyang City, went to the station to see them off.

    要求揭发和制止美帝国主义对我国的侵略行为
    【新华社沈阳二十八日电】国际民主法律工作者协会调查团完成了调查美帝国主义在东北进行细菌战的罪行的工作，于三月二十八日分别向该会主席普里特·邓波尔（英国、伦敦）、副主席杰伊丁（苏联、莫斯科）、沈钧儒
    （中华人民共和国、北京）、伊奥罗斯基·伊尔兹伊（波兰、华沙）、戴拉西尼（意大利、罗马）、布非鲁夫人（比利时、布鲁塞尔）致电报告，原文如下：
    我们应国际民主法律工作者协会总书记之请，调查了关于美国飞机在中国东北诸省撒布细菌的指责。我们调查了二月二十九日以来发生的许多事件中的十件，这十件事件遍及中国东北大片地区。在中国东北发现的情况多半和我们在朝鲜所调查的情况相类似。我们特别注意到所发现的昆虫具有异乎寻常的性质，并且密集成群，在极冷的气候中，仍发现它们在冰雪上活着。苍蝇、蚊子、跳蚤和羽毛已被发现带有细菌或病毒。发现一个特别的容器的碎片。尽管防疫措施极其严密，在中国从来没有见过的一种致命的脑炎症已经出现。专家的检验，证明了在发生这种致命病地区发现的某些经过人工感染的蚊虫带有的病毒所造成的效果，与该种脑炎症完全相同。美国飞机曾在发现这种毒虫的邻近地区出现，已经证实。我们认为，美国把它在朝鲜所犯的罪行扩大到一个与它并非处于战争中的国家的土地上，这是美国的侵略行为，这种侵略行为如果现在不予揭发和制止，会对世界和平产生极其严重的后果。布兰德魏纳（团长、奥地利）卡瓦莱里（副团长、意大利）狄布里托（巴西）加斯特尔（英国）贾斯盖（法国）柯柏年（中国）莫伦斯（比利时）华西尔考夫斯卡（波兰）
