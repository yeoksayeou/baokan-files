Some areas of Jilin Province are letting spring plowing preparations drift along without direction.
Counties should immediately dispatch a large number of cadres to the countryside to resolve the ideological problems of district and village cadres, and at the same time help the masses solve specific difficulties such as fertilizer, seeds, and livestock.
Jilin Province has begun preparing for spring plowing. Some progress has been made in implementing production policies, production plans, preparing food, and adjusting seeds; however, some counties still have serious problems that urgently need to be resolved:

First, there is a shortage of fertilizer. For example, Shulan County is still short 15% of the manure needed, and in Fajie District, Jijiapu Village has only accumulated enough manure for 100 hectares of land out of more than 320 hectares (all flat land). In Yongji County, farmers in five villages, including Haji and Magou, still plan to use the old practice of applying manure every two years, with just enough manure for the land that has had the ridges broken ("kou cha di"). They plan not to fertilize the land that has not had the ridges broken ("ga cha di") at all. (The general farming method of farmers in the Northeast is to plant crops on high ridges. Breaking the original ridge to make a new ridge is called "kou cha di"; not breaking the original ridge and planting crops on the original ridge is called "ga cha di.")

Second, there is insufficient preparation of food and horses. This is more serious in disaster areas. For example, in Desheng Village, Changchun County, more than half of the households do not have enough grain to eat until plowing time, and three households currently have nothing to eat. Due to the disaster, farmers in this village sold 42 head of livestock last winter to buy grain, so there are not enough livestock for spring plowing. Huangyuquan Village, Nong'an County, near the mountains, originally had more than 100 horses, but sold more than 50 last fall, making planting a problem.

Third, seeds have not been prepared well. Although seeds for cash crops have been prepared almost adequately, there are major problems with coarse grain seeds. Yongji County is still short 10,000 catties of good sorghum seeds. Huaide County is also short a large number of seeds. Guoqian Banner bought 150,000 catties of soybean seeds in Nong'an County, but they have not yet been transported back, and the masses are waiting. In addition, due to rain and flooding and frost damage last fall, the quality of seeds is poor and the germination rate is low. Some farmers tested rice seeds and found only 30% germination, and the germination rate of sorghum and corn is also low, but the masses have not yet been alerted.

Fourth, there is nowhere to buy wood for repairing farm tools, and the Qidao and Badao dams in Jiaohe County need to be repaired, but there is a lack of wooden piles.

Fifth, mutual aid teams have not yet been adjusted. In some villages, households with horses are organized together, leaving households without horses aside; households without horses cannot organize mutual aid teams. For example, some farmers in Xujiatun plan to buy livestock to plant in yoked pairs, but cannot afford it. Currently, households without horses have great difficulties in planting.

Sixth, drought has already formed in some areas. Last year, the province had sparse snowfall. Yanbian Prefecture had two snowfalls, but the amount of snow was very small, and the ground was dry and cracked; in the central region, Yushu, Yongji, Jiutai and other counties had only about two inches of snowfall last winter, which was blown away by the wind as soon as it fell; the western sandy areas had very little snowfall and severe drought, with only a thin layer of snow covering the ground in Changling County after two snowfalls, and no snow accumulation in the entire territory of Nong'an County.

The above are all fairly common problems. The main reason is that some district and village leaders have not paid attention to the preparations for spring plowing. In particular, some district and village cadres, because they are not clean themselves, have heard that a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is about to be carried out. They are experiencing ideological fluctuations, waiting to be "rectified," and abandoning leadership in preparing for plowing. Counties should quickly and systematically dispatch a large number of cadres to the countryside to first solve the ideological problems of district and village cadres, and at the same time help the masses solve various practical difficulties. The main issues to be resolved are the following:

First, we must vigorously implement agricultural production policies and increase production guidelines to make the masses recognize the direction of production and increase their enthusiasm for production.

Second, we must effectively solve material difficulties. Relevant departments should cooperate closely to help farmers sell their accumulated local products and sideline products. In areas with severe disasters, relief grain should be issued as appropriate to support farmers' sideline production in preparing for plowing; and difficult households should be educated to use their sideline income for preparing for plowing and lay the foundation for spring plowing production.

Third, vigorously mobilize farmers to collect scattered manure, organize the delivery of city manure to the countryside, and prepare fast-acting fertilizers such as fertilizer powder to make up for the shortage of manure. Farmers should be educated to pay attention to the preservation of manure, and they should be mobilized to strive to send manure to the fields before April. In addition, seeds should be quickly adjusted, exchanged, and carefully selected, and germination tests should be carried out.

Fourth, adjust mutual aid teams, settle outstanding debts, and appropriately adjust labor prices based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Special attention should be paid to solving the difficulties of households without vehicles and horses and organizing them into mutual aid teams.

### 吉林省一些地区春耕准备工作陷于自流

    吉林省一些地区春耕准备工作陷于自流
    各县应立即抽调大批干部下乡解决区村干部的思想问题，同时帮助群众解决肥料、种籽、牲畜等项具体困难
    吉林全省已开始进行准备春耕工作。在贯彻生产方针、生产计划、准备吃粮、调剂种籽等方面都已作出一些成绩；但有些县还有较严重的问题，急需解决：
    一、肥料不足。如舒兰县尚缺粪百分之十五，法特区几家屯三百二十多垧地（全是平地）只积够了一百垧地的粪。永吉县哈计、马沟等五个村的农民仍准备沿用二年一槎粪的旧习惯，扣槎地的粪勉强够用，?槎地则打算全不上粪。（东北一般农民的耕作法是把农作物种在高垅上。把原来的垅破开，另作新垅的叫扣槎地；不破开原来的垅，就在原来的垅上种植作物的，叫?槎地。）
    二、食粮、马匹准备不足。这以灾区为较严重。如长春县得胜村占半数以上的户粮食吃不到锄地时候，有三户目前已没吃的。因为灾荒，这个村的农民去冬卖掉了四十二头牲口买粮吃，因此春耕时牲口不够用。农安县靠山区黄鱼圈村原有一百多匹马，去秋卖掉了五十多匹，种地也成问题。
    三、种籽没准备好。商品作物种籽虽已准备得差不多，但粗粮种籽问题很大。永吉县还缺一万斤好高粮种。怀德县也缺种籽很多。郭前旗在农安县买了十五万斤豆种，还没运回，群众正在等待。此外，因去秋雨涝、霜害，种籽质量不好，出芽率低。有的农民试验稻种只有百分之三十出芽，高粮、玉茭出芽率也不高，但群众尚未引起警惕。
    四、修理农具的木料无处购买，蛟河县七、八道水坝须补修，但缺乏木桩。
    五、互助组还没有调整。有些村有马户组织在一起，把无马户丢在一边；无马户想组织互助组没办法。如徐家屯有的农民打算买牲口插犋种地，但买不起。目前无马户种地有很大困难。
    六、部分地区旱象已形成。去年全省降雪稀薄。延边五县降雪两次，但雪量很少，地表干旱，呈现裂缝；中部地区榆树、永吉、九台等县去冬降雪仅二寸左右，随下随被风括走；西部风砂地区雪量极少，旱象严重，长岭县降雪两次仅盖地皮，农安县全境无积雪。
    以上这些都是相当普遍存在的问题。主要原因是某些区、村领导干部对春耕准备工作还没有重视起来，特别是有的区、村干部因自己手头不干净，听说要进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，思想波动，坐等“挨整”，放弃备耕领导。各县应该赶快有计划地抽调大批干部下乡，首先解决区、村干部的思想问题，同时帮助群众解决各种实际困难。要解决的主要问题有以下几个：
    第一、必须大力贯彻农业生产政策和增产方针，使群众认清生产方向，提高生产积极性。
    第二、必须切实解决物资困难。各有关部门应密切配合起来，帮助农民推销积压的土产和副业产品。在灾情严重地区应酌量发放救济粮，以支持目前农民在备耕中的副业生产；并应教育困难户把副业收入用于备耕方面，打下春耕生产基础。
    第三、大力发动农民收积零散粪肥，组织城粪下乡，准备肥田粉等速效肥料，以补粪肥的不足。要教育农民注意保存粪肥，并动员他们争取在四月以前把粪送到地里。此外，应迅速调剂、串换、精选种籽，进行发芽试验。
    第四、调整互助组，根据自愿两利原则，清结陈欠，适当调整工价。要特别注意解决无车马户的困难，把他们组织到互助组中去。
