Fu Jen Catholic University's anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is underway. In the past month, the focus has been on launching a struggle to criticize bourgeois ideologies among teachers. This struggle is being carried out on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses and in conjunction with the bourgeois decadent ideologies exposed by the university's administration and teachers during the movement. The bourgeois ideology among teachers is extremely serious, mainly manifested as selfish individualism and departmentalism: arrogance, detachment from the masses; an irresponsible attitude towards education; worship of Europe and America, and a failure to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. Before the takeover, some teachers, for personal gain, would rather sacrifice the reasonable interests of students than offend imperialists. Teachers were perfunctory in grading student assignments, often absent from school, and unconcerned about students' studies. Some teachers' teaching content was full of bourgeois reactionary ideas, even feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas. For example, Ouyang Xiang, the head of the Education Department, cited "appearance, voice, emotion, character, and knowledge" as the five major standards for teachers' self-cultivation. When discussing the direction of secondary education, he even spoke of American and Chiang Kai-shek's, but not the People's Government's direction of secondary education. Some teachers, under the guise of "pure technique" and "supra-politics," peddled bourgeois goods. For example, Zhao Xiyu, the head of the Economics Department, taught students private enterprise management methods from capitalist society without any criticism through the course "Enterprise Management." Ye Cangqin, a professor in the Chinese Department, used decadent and sentimental literature to "educate" students, which had a very bad influence on some students.

At the beginning of the movement, the school's Thrift and Inspection Committee convened a meeting of teachers, explained the policies, and encouraged teachers to bravely conduct self-criticism, pointing out that only by resolving to reform themselves would they have a future. Under the leadership of the school's Thrift and Inspection Committee, students made fair and sincere suggestions to teachers at teacher-student conferences, department meetings, and group meetings, dispelling some teachers' concerns that students' opinions at the conference would be biased, and the movement advanced rapidly. In this struggle, some teachers had a sincere and honest attitude, were willing to expose their thoughts, and made more profound self-criticisms. For example, Professor Liu Yusu of the Biology Department, Liu Jingfang, the head of the Mathematics Department, Professor Zhao Xiyu of the Economics Department, Xiao Zhang, the head of the Chinese Department, Deputy Dean Lin Chuanding, and President Chen Yuan, etc., all made significant progress in the movement and were warmly welcomed by students. However, a few teachers, such as Dong Weixian, an associate professor in the Chemistry Department, and Lu Huaibao, the head of the Biology Department, usually spread reactionary remarks and resisted progress; in this movement, their self-criticism was not honest, and they were severely criticized by teachers and students.

    辅仁大学在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中
    对教师的资产阶级思想进行严格批判
    辅仁大学的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动正在进行中，在最近的一个月中，集中力量在教师中开展了批判资产阶级思想的斗争。这一斗争是在充分发动群众的基础上，结合该校行政和教师在运动中暴露出来的资产阶级腐朽思想开展起来的。教师中的资产阶级思想极端严重，主要表现为损人利己的个人主义和本位主义：自高自大、脱离群众；对教育事业不负责任的混世态度；崇拜欧美和敌我不分的思想等。接管以前，有的教师为了个人的利益，宁肯牺牲同学们合理的利益而不肯得罪帝国主义分子。教师批改学生作业马马虎虎，经常不到校，不关心同学的学业。有些教师的教学内容充满了资产阶级的反动思想，甚至是封建的买办的法西斯主义思想。例如教育系主任欧阳湘，讲教师的修养以“仪容、声音、情绪、品格、学识”为五大标准。讲中学教育方针时，竟讲了美国的和蒋匪的而不讲人民政府的中学教育方针。有的教师则在“纯技术”“超政治”的牌子下面，贩卖资产阶级的货色。如经济系主任赵锡禹，通过“企业管理”这门课程，毫无批判地把资本主义社会的私营企业管理方法教给学生。中文系教授叶苍芩以颓废感伤的文学，去“教育”学生，使一些学生受了很坏的影响。
    运动一开始，学校节约检查委员会便召开了教师会议，讲明政策，鼓励教师勇敢进行自我批评，指出只有下决心改造自己，才会有前途。在学校节约检查委员会领导下，学生们在师生大会、系会、小组会上，公正而且诚恳地向教师提意见，解除了有些教师恐怕学生们在大会上发表意见会发生偏差的思想顾虑，运动迅速地前进。在这次斗争中，有的教师的态度诚恳老实，肯暴露自己的思想，检讨较深刻。如生物系教授刘玉素、数学系主任刘景芳、经济系教授赵锡禹、中文系主任萧璋、副教务长林传鼎、校长陈垣等，都在运动中获得了显著进步，受到学生的热烈欢迎。但也有少数教师如化学系副教授董维宪、生物系主任鹿怀宝等平时散播反动言论，抗拒进步；在这次运动中，检讨态度又不老实，因而受到教师和学生们的严厉批评。
