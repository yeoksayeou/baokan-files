	Formulating a Battle Plan to Counter the American Aggressors' Germ Warfare

	To the Editor: We have seen in the newspapers the news that American imperialism, after suffering a disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield, is using bacteriological weapons to slaughter peace-loving people, and we are extremely indignant.

	We are medical workers, warriors who directly fight against bacteria that poison humanity. Today, we absolutely cannot tolerate such rampant behavior by American imperialism. We must give American imperialism a resounding response with practical actions. We have formulated the following battle plan: 1. Organize a volunteer epidemic prevention team to stand by for deployment to Korea.

	2. Organize research and study groups to study the types of bacteriological weapons used by American imperialism, the routes of transmission, the symptoms of disease, and methods of prevention and treatment. 3. Organize a propaganda group to explain the symptoms of disease and methods of prevention to the masses.

	We Want to Contribute Our Knowledge of Insects to Extinguish the Poisonous Flames of the American Bandits' Germ Warfare
	To the Editor: The frenzied American bandits are spreading bacteria in large quantities on the Korean front and in the rear, and disregarding the warnings of the people of China and the just people of the world, they dare to spread bacteria in Northeast China, using insects as tools of aggressive warfare. This blatant crime of expanding the war has made us feel extremely indignant, and has made us further realize that American imperialism is not only the mortal enemy of peace-loving people all over the world, but also the destroyer of human science and culture.

	We study insects, and we absolutely cannot tolerate an insect carrying bacteria harming our "most beloved people," harming the Korean People's Army and civilians, and harming our compatriots. History has proven the fighting will of the Chinese and Korean peoples, proven the strength of peace-loving people all over the world, and proven that any crazy act of American aggressive bandits cannot frighten the Chinese and Korean peoples, and can never save their inevitable defeat. The crimes of American imperialism can only further arouse the boundless indignation of the Chinese and Korean peoples and their determination to kill the enemy and avenge themselves. We are determined to contribute all our knowledge and skills about insects, participate in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, serve the motherland, and defend the security of the motherland and world peace. We are willing to participate in epidemic prevention work; this is the glorious and sacred task of every insect researcher. In front of the people of the whole country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we swear that we are ready to depart at any time and listen to the assignment of the motherland. We have the confidence to extinguish the poisonous flames of the American aggressive bandits' germ warfare and give the American imperialist bandits a powerful response. Before our departure, we must exert greater efforts to eliminate the corrupt bourgeois ideology that poisons our youth—the pro-American ideology, the sectarianism ideology—and carry the anti-corruption movement to the end, thoroughly smashing the bourgeoisie's rampant offensive, and supporting the front line with practical actions.

	We Want to Complete Production Tasks and Do a Good Job in the Anti-Corruption Movement to Counter the American Aggressors
	To the Editor: When all the employees of our factory heard the news about American imperialism continuously spreading bacteria in Northeast China, we immediately convened an employee meeting. At the meeting, we unanimously stated that we must not tolerate these beasts continuing to act recklessly. In addition to guaranteeing the completion of production tasks and thoroughly carrying out the anti-corruption movement at our work posts, young comrades are also ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, go to the places where we are needed, and use practical actions to counter the invasion of the American imperialist beasts!

	The Entire Staff of the Scientific and Technical Printing Factory

	To the Editor: We cannot tolerate the crimes of American imperialism in spreading bacteria in Korea and Northeast China. The bacteriological warfare waged by the American aggressors, who have been defeated in Korea, will only strengthen our determination to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

	All our employees are determined to express our protest by creating the highest output and thoroughly carrying out the anti-corruption movement; we have resolved to respond to the call of the motherland, rush to the front, and avenge our blood debt!

	The Entire Staff of Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant

	To the Editor: The heinous crimes of American imperialism in spreading bacteria in Korea and Northeast China have aroused our boundless anger. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, and we demand that the government immediately take necessary measures to give the American imperialists a fatal blow. All the employees and families of our Capital Power Plant pledge to be the government's rear guard, and we await Chairman Mao's call and any tasks assigned to us.

	The Entire Staff and Families of the Capital Power Plant

	To the Editor: American imperialism released Japanese bacteriological war criminals, used captured volunteer soldiers to experiment with bacteriological weapons, and recently spread bacteria in Korea and Northeast China. We absolutely cannot tolerate this series of crimes. We demand to go to the Korean front immediately to eliminate the American aggressor troops. Before we get permission, we must stick to our posts, on the one hand, catch all the "tigers" in the factory, and on the other hand, do a good job in production, and use practical actions to strengthen our national defense forces, so that American imperialist planes dare not even touch the edge of our motherland's airspace!

	Entire Faculty, Students, and Staff of Yenching University Signatures to Protest the American Aggressor Troops' Germ Warfare; Resolutely Eliminate the Influence of American Cultural Aggression
	We, the entire faculty, students, and staff of Yenching University, express our serious protest with boundless anger against the heinous crime of American imperialism in spreading bacteria in Northeast China! American imperialism, at the time of its disastrous defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, is carrying out germ warfare in a dehumanized way, completely exposing the ugly face of the American bandits. We know that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, we exposed the crimes of American imperialism's cultural aggression at Yenching University; today, American imperialism is actually using bacteria to slaughter our compatriots. We are truly unbearable and extremely resentful!

	We want to warn American imperialism: The Chinese and Korean peoples are invincible! Your attempt to use bacteriological weapons to seek to reverse the defeat will surely be completely crushed under the iron fists of the people! We want to transform our anger into strength, carry the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to the end, and thoroughly eliminate the influence of American imperialism's cultural aggression in Yenching. We are determined to contribute all our strength to support the just war of the Chinese and Korean People's Army, respond to all the calls of the motherland, and, together with the people of the whole country and the whole world who love peace and uphold justice, completely eliminate the heinous American aggressors!

	All Members of the Tsinghua University Education Union Resolve to Oppose America's Germ Warfare with Practical Actions
	To the Editor: After seeing the news that the evil American imperialism was bombing and spreading bacteria in Northeast China, our various trade union groups held meetings to discuss this matter. From the new aggressive atrocities of American imperialism, we have more clearly recognized its hideous and shameless face. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, and we must severely punish the American murderers who bombed the Northeast and spread bacteria.

	In the past few days, many members have expressed their determination at group meetings. Some wrote letters of determination. Professor Zhang Mingtao, head of the Department of Electrical Engineering, said: "In the past, many people did not have a clear understanding of American imperialism, and always said that they could not hate the United States emotionally; today, if anyone says such a thing again, they are truly conscience-stricken." Professor Zhang Zigao, the old head of the Department of Chemistry, said excitedly: "American imperialism is trying to use germ warfare tactics to reverse his unredeemable failure. This is something that people with conscience all over the world cannot tolerate. We must take action and fight resolutely against American imperialism." Everyone realized that protest alone is not enough, we must take action. Sun Yueming, assistant researcher at the Fuel Research Office, said:

	"I'm very anxious in my heart, I can't wait to go to the front line and beat them hard." Professor Chen Zhen, head of the Department of Biology, said: If the motherland needs me to go there, I will go there and resolutely respond to the call of the government. Teachers from the Department of Chemical Engineering and the Department of Chemistry have been studying how to use the science and technology we have mastered to manufacture insecticides and various medicines needed by the front line to increase the strength to fight back against the American aggressors. Professor Lu Shijia of the Department of Aeronautics said: "I can give injections." All the staff of the school infirmary wrote a letter of determination. They wrote: "We must, from the standpoint of revolutionary medical workers, under the leadership of the Party, immediately organize ourselves, prepare sufficient strength, and respond to the call of the motherland at any time, and strive to be the soldiers at the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare."

	Women Have the Confidence to Repel American Aggression and Not Allow a Single Child to Be Harmed
	To the Editor: The news of American imperialism launching germ warfare has made us further recognize its brutality and weakness. We protest the shameless crimes of American imperialism and hope that women across the country and around the world will unite to stop this crime. We ask medical workers across the country to take action, exert all their wisdom and strength, and do a good job in epidemic prevention. We raise our hands to the great leader Chairman Mao and swear:

	Wherever the motherland needs us, we will go there!
	Exert all our strength to repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attack!
	We women have the confidence to repel the aggression of American imperialism and not let a single child be harmed!

	All Women Comrades of the Beijing People's Art Theater Drama Troupe

	The Happy Life of Young Pioneers Must Never Be Infringed Upon by American Aggressors
	To the Editor: When we saw the news in the newspaper that American imperialism was spreading bacteria in Northeast China, we were all very angry. When we thought of the Young Pioneer comrades in the Northeast who are living a happy life wearing red scarves like us being attacked by American devils, we couldn't wait to immediately take up guns and go to Korea to fight the American devils!

	We believe that this crime of American imperialism can never save its failure on the Korean battlefield. All our members unanimously stated that we will use more diligent study, physical exercise, propaganda to our parents and neighbors, and other practical actions to support Uncle Volunteers and protest the crimes of American imperialism.

    我们燕京大学全体师生员工以无比的愤怒，对美帝国主义在东北撒布毒菌的滔天罪行，提出严重的抗议！美帝国主义在侵朝战争惨败之际，竟灭绝人性地进行细菌战争，完全暴露了美国强盗的丑恶面目。我们知道，美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，我们揭露了美帝国主义在燕京大学的文化侵略的罪行；今天，美帝国主义竟又以毒菌来屠杀我同胞，我们真是忍无可忍，愤恨万分！
    我们要警告美帝国主义：中国人民和朝鲜人民是不可战胜的！你们用细菌武器以求挽回败局的企图，一定要在人民的铁掌下，被彻底粉碎！我们要化愤怒为力量，把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动进行到底，彻底肃清美帝国主义在燕京的文化侵略影响。我们决心贡献我们的一切力量，支援中朝人民部队的正义战争，响应祖国的一切号召，和全国、全世界爱好和平、主持正义的人们一道，彻底消灭万恶的美国侵略者！

    编辑同志：看到了万恶的美帝国主义在我国东北滥施轰炸并撒布毒菌的消息，我们各工会小组纷纷开会，讨论这件事情。我们从美帝国主义的新的侵略暴行中，更清楚地认识了它那狰狞无耻的面目。我们坚决拥护周外长的声明，我们一定要严惩滥炸东北和撒布细菌的美国凶手。
    几天来，很多会员在小组会上表示了自己的决心。有的写下了决心书。电机系系主任章名涛教授说：“过去许多人对美帝国主义认识不清，总是说在感情上仇美仇不起来；今天，再要有人讲这种话，他真是丧尽天良了。”化学系系主任张子高老教授激动地说：“美帝国主义是想用细菌战术来挽回他无法挽救的失败。这是全世界有良心的人所不能容忍的事。我们要行动起来，和美帝国主义坚决斗争。”大家都认识到：单是抗议是不够的，我们一定要行动起来。燃料研究室的助理研究员孙岳明说：
    “我心里急得很，恨不得上前线，狠狠地捶他们一顿。”生物学系系主任陈桢教授表示：祖国需要我到那儿去，我就到那儿去，坚决响应政府的号召。化工系、化学系的教师们纷纷研究，怎样用我们所掌握的科学技术，来制造前方所需要的杀虫剂和各种药品，来增加回击美国侵略者的力量。航空系陆士嘉教授说：“我可以去打针。”校医室的全体工作同志写了决心书。他们写道：“我们要以革命的医务工作者的立场，在党的领导下，立即组织起来，准备充分力量，随时响应祖国号召，争取作反细菌战斗争中的最前线的战士。”

    我们相信美帝国主义这种罪行，绝对不能挽救他在朝鲜战场上的失败。我们全体队员一致表示，用更加努力学习、锻炼身体、向爸爸妈妈和街坊宣传等实际行动，支援志愿军叔叔，来抗议美帝国主义的罪行。
