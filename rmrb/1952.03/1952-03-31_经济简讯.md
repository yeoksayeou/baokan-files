　　▲ The Xikang Provincial People's Government is vigorously mobilizing farmers to increase the production of border tea to supply Tibetan areas. At the same time, it is also planning to expand the tea planting area in Tibetan autonomous regions. This spring, more than 20,000 jin of tea seeds have been loaned out in tea-producing areas. In order to systematically expand the tea planting area, the Xikang Provincial People's Government has now transported ten times more tea seeds to Tibetan autonomous regions than last year, and is concentrating a group of Tibetan farmers to learn tea planting techniques.
　　▲ The number of wells dug by the vast number of farmers in Shandong Province has greatly exceeded the province's plan to dig 200,000 wells this year. The Changwei and Jiaozhou regions alone plan to dig more than 300,900 new wells this year. The province plans to supply farmers with 60,000 waterwheels throughout the year, and the demand currently exceeds the supply.

    ▲山东省广大农民目前打成的井已大大超过了今年全省打井二十万眼的计划，单是昌潍专区和胶州专区今年就计划打新井三十万零九千多眼。该省计划全年供应农民六万部水车，目前也有供不应求之势。
