Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editor:
    The criticism of the bureaucratic work style of our section's leading cadres published in the People's Daily on January 17th is completely accurate. We have already made a self-criticism to the staff and worker representatives' meeting and absorbed the opinions of the staff and worker representatives. In order to avoid the occurrence of operational accidents, we have adopted a method of assigning responsibility at each level and mastering technical skills, regulations, and theory, and we have also organized an accident research group. We have learned from the lesson of wasting coal in November of last year, convened various meetings, and corrected the erroneous concept of train attendants wasting coal. Judging from the situation in December of last year, our section saved more than 70,000 catties of coal, reversing the previous phenomenon of wasting coal. Regarding the issue of workers' rationalization proposals, we plan to set up groups in each workshop to specifically study and test rationalization proposals, with dedicated personnel in charge of materials. We thank the readers for their help.
    Zhangjiakou Railway Section Chief Li Fengchao

    张家口机务段领导干部对官僚主义作风的检讨
    编辑同志：一月十七日，人民日报发表了对我段领导干部官僚主义作风的批评，内容完全确实。我们已向职工代表会作了检讨，吸收了职工代表的意见。为了避免运转事故的发生，我们采取了逐级负责，掌握学习技术、规程、理论的办法，并组织了事故研究组。我们接受去年十一月份浪费机煤的教训，召开了各种会议，纠正了乘务员浪费机煤的错误观念。以去年十二月份的情况来看，我段节省机煤七万多斤，已扭转了过去的浪费机煤的现象。关于工人的合理化建议问题，我们准备在各车间设立小组，专门研究试验合理化建议，并由专人掌握材料。我们感谢读者对我们的帮助。
