    Beijing China-Soviet Friendship Association and Soviet Foreign Cultural Association
    Hold Gogol Commemoration Meeting Yesterday
    [Report from this newspaper] March 4th was the 100th anniversary of the death of the great Russian writer Gogol. The Beijing China-Soviet Friendship Association and the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association jointly held a commemoration meeting. Mr. Lao She, Vice President of the Beijing China-Soviet Friendship Association, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers, and People's Artist, delivered the opening speech, pointing out that the Chinese people are very familiar with the great name of Gogol. His novels and dramas have had a great influence on China's new literature and art. Gogol not only created great works for the people of a time and place, but his works are the most brilliant literary and artistic heritage of all mankind. He taught writers all over the world how to use literature and art to fight against darkness; in his hands, literary and artistic creation did not deal with romantic trifles and leisurely sentiments, but tore off the mask and exposed how dirty and sinister the hearts of the oppressors and exploiters were.
    Lao She particularly pointed out: Today, we still have an imperialism in front of us that wants to conquer the whole world and treat the people of the world as "dead souls" to be bought and sold at will, and that is US imperialism. We are here to commemorate Gogol, and we must expose this trick of playing with "dead souls." Not only must we expose it, but we must also actively wage a fierce struggle against capitalism itself and the violence it controls, so that the world may become a bright and peaceful world for the people.
    At the meeting, Soviet friend Ms. Baryshnikova gave a report on "The Great Russian Writer Gogol."

    京中苏友协和苏联对外文协
    昨举行果戈理纪念会
    【本报讯】三月四日是俄罗斯伟大作家果戈理逝世一百周年纪念日，北京市中苏友好协会和苏联对外文化协会联合举行了纪念会。北京市中苏友好协会副会长、北京市文学艺术工作者联合会主席、人民艺术家老舍致开会词指出：中国人很熟悉果戈理这个伟大的名字。他的小说和戏剧，对中国的新文艺起了很大的影响。果戈理不仅为一时一地的人创作出伟大的作品，他的作品是全人类最光辉的文艺遗产。他教全世界的作家明白了怎样以文艺和黑暗作斗争；文艺创作在他的手里不处理什么风花雪月与闲情逸致，而是撕破面皮，暴露压迫者剥削者的心里如何肮脏阴险。
    老舍特别指出：今天我们面前还有个想征服全世界的、想把全世界的人民当作“死魂灵”任意买来卖去的，那就是美帝国主义。我们在这里纪念果戈理，必须要戳穿这种玩弄“死魂灵”的鬼把戏。不但是戳穿，我们还要积极地向资本主义本身与它所支配的暴力作猛烈的斗争，好使世界成为人民的光明的和平的世界。
    会上，苏联友人巴雷什尼科娃作了“俄罗斯伟大作家果戈理”的报告。
