    The First Group of Female Aviation Personnel in New China
    Zhang Wen
    The “March 8th” International Women’s Day of 1952 will be an especially exciting day for the women of New China and the people of the whole country. On this day, airplanes piloted and maintained entirely by the first group of female aviation personnel of New China will fly in formation over Tiananmen Square in the great capital of our motherland, giving a flight demonstration for the broad masses of women and people in the capital.
    A year ago, under the call of strengthening national defense construction in our great motherland, a group of outstanding young women successively joined military cadre schools, taking up the glorious post of defending the motherland. Some of these young women were determined to accept the various restrictions and regulations that must be observed when learning aviation and resolutely requested permission to study aviation. Their request was approved, and after examination, they were honorably admitted. When they thought that women engaging in aviation, an unprecedented event in Chinese history, would be started by them, they all felt that this was a great honor and happiness. They deeply remembered Chairman Mao’s words: our national defense will be consolidated, and no imperialist will be allowed to invade our territory again. We will not only have a strong army, but also a strong air force and a strong navy. They were determined to respond to Chairman Mao's great call by completing the learning task assigned by the Party.
    What they first need to cultivate in their studies is a high degree of discipline. Air Force soldiers operate alone in the air, so discipline is especially important. They know that as a soldier of the People's Air Force, they must not only master the technology skillfully, but also constantly improve their political consciousness and strictly abide by discipline in order to fully utilize their technology to serve the people.
    A glorious task is also an arduous task. There are layers of difficulties on their learning path. Some people who still have outdated views that look down on women are still skeptical about whether female comrades can learn to fly. They ridiculed the female comrades like this: “What airplanes can female comrades fly! As soon as the propeller turns, they will either be scared away or blown away by the vortex.” The physique of the female comrades, before being trained, had some difficulties with the flying life and field aircraft maintenance work that required a certain amount of physical exertion. When they started flying, some of them vomited in the plane. As the number of flights increased and the time was extended, they often felt physically overwhelmed; on the open airport, ground crew members needed to withstand the sun's rays and the cold; maintaining the aircraft required even more energy, and some comrades even felt it difficult to climb onto or jump off the aircraft. Physiological phenomena also often affected their flying mood and learning progress. Flying requires comprehensive attention: the weather and terrain outside the cockpit, and inside the cockpit, things like rudder pedals, control sticks, instrument panel, throttle… A series of actions often need to be taken care of simultaneously. When first learning to fly, they often neglected one thing for another, wishing they had more hands, feet, and eyes. Due to excessive concentration, they often suddenly forgot the various operating principles they had already memorized on the ground.
    However, their learning process also fully demonstrates that the women of New China can participate in more complex aviation undertakings. Ruan Hezhen, whose physical condition was originally qualified, unexpectedly vomited during her first "feeling flight." After getting off the plane, she had the idea that her body was not suitable for flying, and she thought that this first flight would be the last. However, her tenacious determination and the Party's encouragement enabled her to overcome her ideological concerns. She started her second flight. After she successfully completed this flight, she began her third flight with incomparable joy. It was on this occasion that she vomited again and became ill for two weeks as a result. In the hospital bed, she thought: Flying is probably really impossible. Just as she was feeling sad, the leading comrades came to see her, comforted her to rest well, and told her that vomiting at the beginning of flying did not necessarily mean that she was not suitable for flying. The care of the leading comrades restored her confidence. When she flew again after recovering from her illness, the vomiting phenomenon was gone, and the leading comrades specially assigned a chief instructor to fly with her to help her make up the lessons. Later, she was gradually able to fly alone. This incident left such a strong impression on her that it is still a force that encourages her today. She said: "From then on, I knew even more that in order to train our first group of female aviation personnel, the Party will never give up on anyone who can possibly be trained; I have since realized even more that the care and training of the Party and the country for us is the infinite power that enables us to overcome difficulties and master technology."
    A firm belief enabled them to exert a high degree of diligence and studiousness in their studies. In order to familiarize themselves with the operating actions, some even practiced moving the control stick, rudder pedals, and sending telegrams in their sleep at night; many comrades climbed small hills, slid down escalators, and even practiced visual estimation while riding in cars. Their physical strength was not accustomed to labor, so they practiced parallel bars and paid attention to exercise. In order to learn the technology well, many comrades, due to their concentration during work, did not care even if their hands froze and their clothes got wet. Their slogan was: Vomiting does not affect learning, and does not delay flying. When mechanic Li Jian first started learning, she reviewed the lessons of the day after going to sleep. When she felt sleepy during class the next day, she bit her tongue to stimulate her spirit and persevered in her studies.
    The Party branch constantly cared for them during their specific learning process; the Party branch organized mutual assistance movements, so that everyone not only cared about their own learning and their own progress, but also cared about and helped others learn and progress. During flight, comrades who were not scheduled to fly carefully observed everyone's take-off and landing actions on the ground, and discussed and studied with them after they got off the plane; in their spare time, two people held hands and stepped on each other's feet to feel whether the other person's "pulling the stick" and "stepping on the rudder" movements were smooth. The branch also launched a red flag movement, making the scope of mutual assistance even broader, the content richer, and the effect even better. At the same time, through the red flag competition, everyone was united more closely under the spirit of collectivism. The instructors regarded teaching the first group of female aviation personnel in New China as a serious and glorious political task. Therefore, the instructors always carefully understood the students' psychology in each flight stage when teaching, and strived to inspire the students to exert their unique advantages such as carefulness, discipline, and gentle operation in learning. When students encountered difficulties that affected their confidence, the instructors always patiently and carefully repeatedly pointed out the shortcomings and ways to correct them, and used various methods to cultivate their confidence. In order to help them complete their learning tasks, some instructors were still considering the reasons why students were not flying well and how to improve their teaching methods until late at night.
    In this way, they went through a glorious and arduous road. Now, they have not only initially mastered the flying technology, but even the aerial navigation, communication, mechanics, and ground aircraft maintenance work are all undertaken by this group of female aviation personnel. Whenever they fly smoothly in the sky of the motherland, whenever they repair an airplane and ensure a complete flight, people express their warm congratulations to this first group of female aviation personnel in New China with enthusiastic feelings. People firmly believe that the women of New China can also participate in the aviation industry and serve the national defense construction of the motherland. Because Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have opened up an infinitely broad road for the women of New China to serve the motherland.

    新中国的第一批女航空人员
    张文
    一九五二年的“三八”国际妇女节，将是新中国的妇女和全国人民特别兴奋的日子。这一天，全部由新中国第一批女航空人员所驾驶和维护的飞机，将列队飞越伟大祖国首都天安门上空，为首都广大妇女和人民群众作飞行表演。
    一年以前，在伟大祖国加强国防建设的召唤下，一批优秀女青年先后参加了军事干部学校，走上光荣的保卫祖国的岗位。其中一部分女青年决心接受学习航空所必须遵守的种种限制和规定，坚决请求准许她们学习航空。她们的请求被批准了，经过检查，她们光荣地被录取了。当她们想到：妇女从事航空事业，这在中国历史上的创举就要由她们来开始的时候，她们都感到这是莫大的荣誉和幸福。她们深深记住了毛主席的话，我们的国防将获得巩固，不允许任何帝国主义者再来侵略我们的国土。我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军。她们决心要以完成党交付的这个学习任务来响应毛主席的伟大号召。
    她们在学习中首先要培养的是高度的纪律性。空军战士是单独在空中活动的，因此纪律就特别重要。她们知道，作为一个人民空军的战士，不仅要熟练地掌握技术，还要不断提高自己的政治觉悟，严守纪律，才能充分发挥自己的技术为人民服务。
    光荣的任务，也是艰巨的任务。在她们学习的道路上，有着层层的困难。某些还存有轻视妇女的陈腐观点的人们对女同志能否学习飞行还抱着怀疑。他们这样地讥笑女同志：“女同志开什么飞机！螺旋桨一转，不是给吓跑，就是给涡流吹跑。”女同志的体质，对于需要消耗一定体力的飞行生活和外场机务工作在没有经过锻炼以前，是有些困难的。在开始飞行的时候，有的在飞机上呕吐起来，飞行的次数增多，时间延长，身体就常会感到不支；在空旷的机场上，地勤人员需要经得起烈日的照射和严寒的侵袭；维护飞机更需要饱满的精力，有的同志甚至在爬上飞机或从飞机上跳下来都感觉困难。生理上的现象也常常影响到她们飞行的情绪和学习的进步。飞行中需要照顾全面，座舱外的气象和地形，座舱里蹬舵、拉杆、看仪表、管油门……一连串的动作往往需要同时兼顾。初学飞行的时候，往往顾此失彼，希望多生几只手、脚，多长几对眼睛；由于精力的过分集中，往往会将地面上已经记住的各种动作原理忽然忘记。
    但是，她们学习的过程，也充分说明新中国的妇女是可以参加比较复杂的航空事业的。身体本来合格的阮荷珍，在第一次“感觉飞行”的时候，不期然地呕吐了，下飞机以后她产生一种身体不适于飞行的想法，她以为这第一次飞行就将是最后一次的飞行。但是，顽强的决心和党对她的鼓励使她战胜了思想上的顾虑。她又开始了第二次飞行。当她顺利地作了这次飞行以后，她怀着无比的喜悦，开始了第三次飞行。就在这次她又呕吐了，并且因此病了两个星期。在病床上，她想着：飞行，大概真是成为不可能了。正在难过的时候，领导同志来看了她，安慰她好好休养，告诉她在开始飞行的时候，发生呕吐现象不一定就不适合飞行。领导同志的关怀，使她恢复了自信。病好再飞的时候，呕吐现象没有了，领导同志又特派主任教员带她飞行，帮助她补上课目，后来她就慢慢的能单独飞行了。这件事情留给她的印象是如此的强烈，以致至今还是一种鼓舞她的力量。她说：“我从此更知道了，党为了培养我们第一批女航空人员，是绝不放弃任何一个可能培养的人；我从此更体会到，党和国家对我们的关怀和培养，就是使我们能够克服困难，掌握技术的无穷力量。”
    坚强的信念，使她们在学习中发挥了高度的苦学苦钻的精神。为了熟悉操纵动作，有的在晚上睡觉的时候还在比划拉杆、蹬舵，拍发电报；许多同志登小山滑扶梯，甚至在乘汽车的时候都在练习目测；体力不惯劳作，她们就练习双杠，注意运动。为了学好技术，许多同志在工作时，由于精力集中，连手冻僵了，衣服淋湿了都不理；她们的口号是：呕吐不影响学习，不耽误飞行。机械员李坚开始学习的时候，在睡觉以后还复习白天的课目，第二天上课时瞌睡了，就咬紧舌头刺激精神，坚持学习。
    党支部在她们具体的学习过程中，不断地关怀她们；党的支部组织了互助运动，使大家不仅关心自己的学习和自己的进步，而且也关心并帮助别人学习和进步。在飞行的时候，没轮到飞行的同志就在地面注意地观察每个人的起飞、着陆的动作，待其下机后和她讨论研究；闲暇的时候，两个人手拉手，脚蹬脚，互相感觉对方“拉杆”和“蹬舵”的动作是否柔和。支部又掀起了红旗运动，使互助的范围更加扩大，内容更为丰富，效果更为优良。同时通过夺红旗运动，使大家在集体主义的精神下团结得更紧密了。教员们把教会新中国第一批女航空人员当作严肃而光荣的政治任务，因此教员们在教学时总是细心地体会学员在各个飞行阶段的心理，努力启发学员在学习中发挥她们特有的细心、守纪律、操作柔和等优点。在学员遇到困难影响自信的时候，教员们总是耐心细致地反复指出缺点和改正办法，并用种种方法培养她们的信心。为了帮助她们完成学习任务，有的教员直到深夜还在考虑着学员飞不好的原因和改正自己的教学方法。
    就这样，她们走过了一段光荣艰巨的道路。现在，她们不仅已经初步掌握了飞行技术，连空中的领航、通讯、机械、地面的机务等工作都已经全部由这批女航空人员担任起来了。每当她们平稳地飞翔在祖国的天空的时候，每当她们检修好一架飞机，保证了一次完全飞行的时候，人们都以热烈的心情，向这新中国第一批女航空人员致以热烈的贺意。人们深信：新中国的妇女同样可以参加到航空事业里来，为祖国的国防建设服务。因为毛主席和共产党为新中国的妇女开辟了一条无限宽广的为祖国服务的道路。
