I, Zhang Jianguang, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Henan Provincial Huai River Project Headquarters, on behalf of the Henan Provincial Huai River Project Headquarters and the 55 million compatriots in the Huai River basin, the 3 million laborers, cadres, and engineers participating in the Huai River project, want to accuse the Shanghai merchants of sabotaging the Henan Provincial Huai River project with incomparable anger to the people of the whole country.

In the past year, the Henan Provincial Huai River Project Headquarters alone commissioned and purchased engineering equipment worth more than 50 billion yuan in Shanghai. However, according to preliminary investigations, a huge amount of this fund was directly embezzled, extorted, and stolen by unscrupulous merchants with a loss of over 10 billion yuan. The wicked merchants, in order to seize huge profits, gambled on the Huai River project and made fortunes from it, disregarding the success or failure of the Huai River project, the safety of the lives and property of the vast people in the Huai River basin, and the enthusiasm of the hard work of the 3 million laborers, cadres, and engineers. They frantically sabotaged the Huai River project, which was unanimously concerned by the people of the whole country. They not only stole huge amounts of funds for the Huai River project, but also caused immeasurable serious losses to the project.

The means by which the merchants sabotaged our Huai River project were sinister, vicious, despicable, shameless, and inhuman. First of all, they insidiously corrupted and poisoned the cadres who came to Shanghai to purchase equipment for the Huai River project. Of the 17 purchasing agents sent to Shanghai by our headquarters in 1951, 11 were dragged into the water, and the remaining six were also more or less poisoned and stained their hands. The merchants pretended to show "love" to the cadres of the People's Government, shamelessly flattered our purchasing agents, established strongholds, and stole economic intelligence for them to speculate and make money. The merchants even called our purchasing agents "fat sheep"; in order to make a fortune from the "fat sheep", they treated the purchasing agents with "respect as gods and filial piety as fathers", and even despicably used their own wives to seduce them. The boss of the Fugang Auto Parts Factory openly used his wife as bait to invite Qi Xintang, a purchasing agent from the Xuchang Huai River Project Transport Workers' Union, to live in his home, dancing, playing, gambling, and cohabitating with his wife, in order to make a fortune from him. The merchant Li Hanmin seduced more than 30 prostitutes by seducing only two purchasing agents, Ma Shengyun and Zhang Xinchang. In order to drag Wang Zhendong into the water, he did not hesitate to instruct his wife to commit adultery with Wang Cheng. Li Hanmin also used profit-sharing and stock participation to buy off purchasing agents in order to collude with them. According to the confessions of only two purchasing agents, Wang Zhendong and Zhang Xinchang, Li Hanmin was an agent for them who invested 670 million yuan in stocks. Our 11 purchasing agents were thus dragged into the water one after another by the merchants; the merchants took this opportunity to control and coerce the purchasing agents, and frantically stole state property. They used deceptive methods such as "speculative purchasing", "transfer accounts", and "issuing fake invoices" to buy at low prices and transfer accounts at high prices, reaping ten times or even a hundred times the profit between transactions. Merchants such as Zhonghe Automobile Hardware Materials Company and Huaxin Hardware Company had a capital of only one million yuan, had no goods in their stores, and relied entirely on speculative purchasing, transfer accounts, issuing fake invoices, buying empty and selling empty, and even issuing empty invoices without goods, to seize our Huai River funds. Huaxin Hardware Company once altered an invoice for a sleeve worth 20,000 yuan to four, and sold it to the state at a high price of 1.32 million yuan. Others such as Yongxinghua, Daming Automobile Materials Company, and Yongtai Shipyard also used this method to steal and deceive our province's Huai River Project funds.

Secondly, the merchants also used the fraudulent means of shoddy workmanship and reduced materials to sabotage the Huai River project. They disguised old goods as new goods in transactions, and disguised broken goods as good goods after painting and changing fake trademarks. Sometimes, although good goods were sent to the state-managed company for inspection and passed, they were replaced with old goods after inspection. For example, most of the telephone exchange and 40 single machines worth 134 million yuan purchased by the Baisha Reservoir in our province in Shanghai were old goods disguised as new, and the delivery was not working, which affected the project command. Most of the 18 steel sleeves on the five bulldozers purchased by the Banqiao Reservoir in Shanghai were broken and unusable, causing the bulldozers to stop at the construction site and unable to start, delaying 15,000 cubic meters of soil compaction work every day. The water pump purchased by the Baisha Reservoir could not be used to drain the water due to the lack of enamel panels, which prevented 120,000 laborers from working smoothly for five days, causing serious losses to the project.

For example, when the Shanghai Panhua Machinery Engineering Company drilled the dam foundations of the Baisha, Shimantan, Nanwan, Longshan, Boshan, and other reservoirs in Henan, as well as the Foziling Reservoir in northern Anhui, this "company" originally had only one small, dilapidated drilling machine worth 10 million yuan, which was far from being able to undertake the drilling work of the dam foundation of a reservoir project. However, this merchant used despicable means such as private solicitation and fraud to contract the drilling projects of the dam foundations of seven reservoirs, with a total price of tens of billions of yuan, which greatly affected the progress of the reservoir project (the reservoir project cannot be blindly constructed if the dam foundation is not properly drilled), and several reservoirs could not start construction on schedule. This "company" even bribed responsible engineering personnel and bought off Yang Zhengfu, a cadre who reviewed the contract, to increase the drilling price and seize a profit of about 200 million yuan, and embezzled about 150 million yuan in the purchase of materials. Due to extortion and theft of Huai River Project funds, they made a fortune and bought five more machines; however, they were still insufficient, but secretly arranged to report more hard rock formations and seize high prices. The quality of the dam foundation geology and the location of the dam body are closely related to the entire reservoir project. If the dam foundation is not solid, the dam is prone to collapse and danger, causing floods. However, this "company" disregarded the life of the reservoir project and the safety of the lives and property of the people in the Huai River basin, and speculatively took advantage of opportunities to deceive and steal in a manner that harmed nature and reason.

For example, the culvert projects for flood storage in four low-lying areas, such as Laowangpo and Wusong Lake in our province, were contracted by Shanghai Zhonghua and Silian Construction Factories. The Zhonghua Construction Factory did not send the machines to the construction site as stipulated in the contract, and had to replace them with manual labor, which made the culvert project unsustainable. During the autumn flood season last year, the floods in the nearby areas were aggravated as a result. Due to their shoddy workmanship and reduced materials in the project, the four culverts have now been cracked and lost their function. In order to avoid causing floods, the state has to pay more than 7 billion yuan to repair them.

The organs responsible for the Shimantan and Banqiao Reservoir projects in our province commissioned the Taichang Shipyard of the Shanghai First Shipbuilding Joint Company in May 1951 to customize four sets of sluice gates for the two reservoirs, and the Longda, Fuxing, Maozhong, and Linchang shipyards to customize two winches (also known as hoists), totaling about 900 million yuan. The Taichang and other shipyards overestimated the cost price and made a profit of about 150 million yuan; the delay in delivery of winches and corner wheels should have been fined more than 100 million yuan, but the bribed purchasing agents did not impose the fines privately. These shipbuilding factories, in order to make a fortune from the Huai River project, disregarded the importance of the sluice gates and winches on the reservoir and the lives of the vast people in the Huai River basin, and took advantage of opportunities, frantically and viciously cutting corners, making the four sluice gates and two winches not up to specifications. The steel plates on the sluice gates are used to resist and control floods and must be strong and durable; however, the merchants defrauded the price of new steel plates and used the old and dilapidated ship plates from ships from the previous twenty or thirty years. The nuts on the sluice gates are used to control the parts; however, the merchants only bought old screws from the outside and installed them, so the parts kept falling off. Due to shoddy workmanship and crude manufacturing, the upper and lower seams and rubber bands of the sluice gates also leaked water, which not only could not control the floods, but also increased the pressure of the floods on the sluice gates due to leakage, making them prone to danger. The manufactured winch lacked two handwheels, and not only did it not meet the contract stipulation of 20 tons of winch force, but it could not even winch the sluice gate, which was reduced in weight due to shoddy workmanship. The bearing bush on the winch is an important part; however, the merchants only wrapped a layer of inferior copper material, which is easy to break and cause danger. Such shoddy sluice gates and winches are useless waste products on the reservoir project; and the Shimantan Reservoir project was completed last year with the arduous and tense efforts of 50,000 laborers, 500 engineers, and cadres day and night; the Banqiao Reservoir project will also be completed this spring. Everyone is looking forward to installing the sluice gates to control floods and eliminate water disasters; but the illegal capitalists are so harmful, insidious, evil, and insane in cutting corners, making the local people at risk of floods; and the difficult projects such as reservoir tunnels may also be destroyed due to the danger of the sluice gates.

Our province's Huai River construction site bought 11 generators from Shanghai Wansheng, Zhongmao, Rongchang, and other electrical machinery factories in 1951, totaling 3 billion yuan. Although the purchase was inspected by the electrical appliance company and deemed "qualified", due to the unscrupulous merchants stealing materials after the inspection, half of them broke down every two or three days and were constantly repaired, and three could not be started. When this deal was concluded, the merchants dared to brag and write "guarantees"; however, these machines could only be "stored in the warehouse" after being transported to the construction site. In the generator project alone, in addition to the merchants seizing a profit of 500 million yuan, we also suffered a loss of 1.5 billion yuan due to the theft of materials. More importantly, in order to complete the reservoir project before the flood season, it is necessary to mobilize more than 100,000 laborers to work overtime day and night, and generators are urgently needed for lighting; however, due to the deception of the merchants, most of the generators purchased were dilapidated, and some could not be started, which directly affected the progress of the project and put the project in a passive position. What a serious loss this is!

The organs responsible for the Baisha and Banqiao Reservoir projects in our province sent people to Shanghai Cifeng, Caoshuntai, and other vehicle parts factories in the winter of 1951 to customize 3,300 sets of frame cart axles. After these manufacturers learned about this procurement information, they thought it was a "big piece of fat" and swarmed around our purchasing agents, vying to eat this "big piece of fat". They colluded with big brokers Li Hanmin, Lin Wei, Tang Mou, and others to generally increase the unit price by 100,000 yuan, seizing a total profit of 330 million yuan. What is more serious is the shoddy workmanship and reduced materials; the 100,000 steel wires contracted by Lihe and other steel wire factories were all plated and did not meet the size, causing us a loss of 30 million yuan. The good materials were specified for the ball bearing frames on the 1,000 sets of frame carts manufactured by the Cifeng Vehicle Parts Factory, and each set was 75,000 yuan more expensive than the goods manufactured by general factories, but only a few (about 300 sets) used good materials, defrauding and stealing 75 million yuan from our Huai River Project funds.

Our province's Huai River Project Headquarters and Baisha Reservoir bought 12 cars from Xingda and other car dealerships in Shanghai in 1951, and half of them were dilapidated old goods disguised as new. Among them, the Baisha Reservoir purchased a medium-sized jeep from Xingda Car Dealership in November. The purchase price of this dealership was 54 million yuan, and it was sold to us for 81 million yuan. After this car was transported from Shanghai to Xuchang by train, it was supposed to be driven to Baisha Reservoir, but it could not be started at all, and Baisha Reservoir had to send a ten-wheel truck to tow it back to Baisha.

The big merchant Li Hanmin was a big broker for many years. After he successfully seduced the purchasing personnel of our province's Huai River Project in the spring of 1951, he even more unscrupulously defrauded and stole our Huai River Project funds. He and Zhonghe, Huaxin, and other hardware stores, Daming Automobile Materials Store, and brokers Wen Jianhua, Lin Wei, Tang Mou, and others organized a theft gang, and the blank fake invoices he opened amounted to 4 billion yuan. In order to steal Huai River Project property, he even used the blank invoices of the Xinsheng Hardware Store, which had disappeared without a trace after liberation, to defraud and steal our Huai River Project property, buying at low prices and reselling at a hundred times the profit, defrauding and selling to our side. Shoddy workmanship and stealing beams and changing pillars were even more common. In the past year, most of the 50 billion yuan of procurement funds used by our province's Huai River Project Headquarters and various reservoirs in Shanghai were handled by him. According to preliminary investigations, this criminal and the theft gang he organized defrauded and stole more than 10 billion yuan from us. Most of the equipment he purchased was dilapidated. Baisha Reservoir alone had nearly 4 billion yuan of equipment that was old and broken, causing serious losses to the project. His conspiracy to sabotage our province's Huai River Project was extremely heinous, and he has now been arrested by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and will be punished according to law.

There are many outrageous acts of sabotage of our province's Huai River Project by Shanghai merchants, which are too numerous to mention. Most of them have already confessed their mistakes, and we will report to the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and the Production Increase and Economy Practice Committee for appropriate handling based on the seriousness of the circumstances and the degree of confession. However, there are still a few merchants who refuse to confess and are still trying to get away with cunning and fraudulent means. We must remind them here: refusing to confess and stubbornly resisting the anti-theft movement will only be severely punished. We will never let you deceive, coax, or escape!

Finally, we want to loudly appeal to the compatriots of the whole country: Please pay attention to the outrageous sabotage of the Huai River Project by illegal merchants, report their crimes, unite together, give the merchants a strong counterattack, smash their attacks, and fight to ensure the smooth completion of the great Huai River Project and the happy life of more than 50 million compatriots in the Huai River basin!

    控诉上海奸商破坏河南省治淮工程的罪行
    河南省治淮总部政治部副主任  张剑光
    我要代表河南省治淮总部和淮河流域的五千五百万同胞、参加治淮工程的三百万民工、干部和工程人员，以无比的愤怒来向全国人民控诉上海市奸商们破坏河南省治淮工程的罪行。
    一年来，河南省治淮总部仅在上海招商代办工程、采购工程器材，就值五百多亿元；但这一笔巨额的款项，仅据初步调查，就被丧尽天良的不法奸商们直接地侵吞、讹诈、盗窃了一百数十亿元。万恶的奸商们，为了攫取暴利，投治淮机，发治淮财，竟不顾治淮工程的成败，不顾淮河流域广大人民生命财产的安全，不顾三百万民工、干部和工程人员艰苦劳动的热忱，对全国人民所一致关切的治淮工程，猖狂地进行破坏。他们不仅盗窃了巨额的治淮经费，而且使工程受到了难以计量的严重损失。
    奸商们对我治淮工程的破坏手段，是阴险毒辣、卑鄙无耻、灭绝人性的。他们首先对到上海采购治淮器材的干部，无孔不入地进行腐蚀、毒化。我总部于一九五一年派到上海的十七个采购员，就有十一个被拖下水，其余六人也多少受到了毒化，沾污了手。奸商们伪装对人民政府干部表示“爱戴”，无耻地对我采购员捧场，扎下据点，去为他们窃取经济情报，投机发财。奸商们竟称我采购员为“大肥羊”；为了能从“大肥羊”身上发肥财，对采购员“敬之如神，孝之如父”，甚至卑鄙地用自己的老婆来勾引。富康车料厂老板为了从许昌治淮搬运工会采购员祁心堂身上发肥财，竟公开以自己妻子为诱饵，请祁心堂住到他家，与他妻子同舞、同玩、同赌、同居。奸商李汉民仅勾引马胜云、张欣昌两个采购员，即勾引他们嫖过三十多个妓女；为了拖王振东下水，不惜授意自己的妻子与王成奸。李汉民为了勾通采购员，又以分赃、入股来进行收买。仅据王振东、张欣昌两采购员坦白，由李汉民代为入股的就有六亿七千万元。我们十一个采购员就这样一个接一个被奸商拖下了水；奸商们就借此控制，胁迫采购员，疯狂地盗窃国家财产。他们采用了“套买”、“转账”、“开假发票”等欺骗手段，低价买来，高价转账，转手之间，竟掠取十倍以至百倍的暴利。中和汽车五金材料行、华信五金号等奸商，本金不过一百万元，店内无货，全以套买、转账、开假发票、买空卖空，甚至开无货的空头发票。来攫取我治淮款项。华信五金号曾以价值两万元的一只套筒，涂改发票为四只，以一百三十二万元高价出售给国家。其它如永兴华、大明汽车材料行、永泰造船厂等，也都曾用过这种手段，盗骗过我省治淮经费。
    其次，奸商们又用了偷工减料的欺诈手段，来破坏治淮工程。他们在交易时以旧货冒充新货，把破货经油漆换假商标后，冒充好货，有时虽将好货送到国家专管公司检验合格，但检验后，又换上旧货。如我省白沙水库在上海买到一部电话总机、四十部单机，共价一亿三千四百万元，多半是旧货冒新，送话不灵，影响了工程指挥。板桥水库在上海买的五部推土机上的十八个钢套，大部破旧不堪，致推土机停在工地不能开动，每天要耽误一万五千公方的压土工程。白沙水库买的抽水机因缺珐琅盘，无法用以排除积水，使十二万民工在五天内不能顺利施工，使工程受到严重损失。
    再如去年由上海泛华机器工程公司钻探河南的白沙、石漫滩、南湾、龙山、薄山以及皖北的佛子岭等水库坝基时，这个“公司”本来只有一部价值一千万元的残旧的小型钻探机，远不能胜任一个水库工程坝基的钻探工作，但这家奸商却以私人拉拢、欺诈等卑鄙手段，承包了七个水库坝基的钻探工程，工价数十亿元，以致大大影响了水库工程的进度（坝基钻探不好，水库工程不能盲目施工），几个水库迟迟不能如期开工。这个“公司”更贿赂较负责的工程人员，收买审查合同的干部杨正夫，提高钻探工价，攫取暴利约两亿元，且在代购材料中盗窃约一亿五千万元。由于讹诈盗窃治淮经费，发了横财，他们又买进五部机器；但仍不敷用，却暗地布置多报硬石方，窃取高价。坝基地质的好坏，坝身位置的设置，与整个水库工程关系极为密切。坝基不坚固，大坝即易塌陷出险，酿成水灾。但这个“公司”却不顾水库工程的寿命和淮河流域人民生命财产的安全，而伤天害理地投机取巧、欺诈盗骗。
    又如我省老王坡、吴宋湖等四处洼地蓄洪涵洞工程，是上海中华、四联等营造厂代办的。中华营造厂未按合同规定把机器送到工地，不得不以人工代替，致使涵闸工程不能持久，去年秋汛时期，已因此加重了附近的水灾。由于他们在工程中偷工减料，现在四处涵闸，均已破裂失去作用。为了避免酿成水灾，国家不得不再付出七十多亿元来从事修理。
    我石漫滩、板桥水库工程负责机关于一九五一年五月向上海市第一造船联营所的泰昌造船厂定制两个水库的四副闸门，向隆大、复兴、茂中、林昌四个造船厂定制两部绞车（又名启闭机），总价约九亿元。泰昌等造船厂，高估成本价额，牟取暴利约一亿五千万元；绞车和转角轮等延期不能交货等应罚一亿多元，当时受贿的采购员私自未罚。这些造船工厂，为发治淮财，竟然不顾闸门、绞车在水库上的重要和淮河流域广大人民的生命，而投机取巧，疯狂阴毒地偷工减料，使四副闸门、两部绞车都不合规格。闸门上的钢板，是用以抵抗、控制洪水的，必须坚固耐久；但奸商却骗取了新钢板的价钱，而用了前二三十年的破船上的残旧船板。闸门上的螺丝帽，是用以管制各部零件的；但奸商仅从外面买来旧螺丝装上，所以各部零件不断脱落。由于偷工减料，粗制滥造，闸门的上下接缝和橡皮带也都漏水，不仅不能控制洪水，且因漏水而加重了洪水对闸门的压力，容易出险。所制的绞车少做了两个手摇轮，不仅未按合同规定做到绞力二十吨，而且对偷工减料减轻重量的闸门，也无法绞动。绞车上的轴瓦，是重要部分；但奸商却只包了一层低劣的铜料，容易折断出险。如此偷工减料的闸门、绞车，目前在水库工程上，是无用的废品；而石漫滩水库工程已于去年在五万民工、五百名工程人员和干部夜以继日的艰苦紧张的努力劳动下完成了；板桥水库的工程，也将于今年春季完成。大家在仰望着安装闸门，控制洪水，免除水患；但违法的资本家却如此伤天害理，阴险万恶，丧心病狂地偷工减料，使当地人民有遭致水灾的危险；水库隧洞等艰难工程，也有因闸门出险而遭破坏的可能。
    我省治淮工地于一九五一年在上海万盛、中贸、荣昌等电机厂买来十一部发电机，总价三十亿元。采购时，虽经电器公司派人检验“合格”，但由于不法奸商们在检验后偷料，其中就有半数是三天两头坏，不断修理，三部不能发动。当成交这笔生意时，奸商们竟敢吹大话，立“保证书”；但这些机器运到工地后却只能“入库保管”。仅发电机一项，除奸商们攫取了五亿元的暴利外，因偷料使我们受到损失的也有十五亿元。更重要的是，水库工程为了在汛前完成，必须调集十多万民工，昼夜加班，急需发电机来照明；但因奸商的欺骗，买来的发电机大部残破，有的不能发动，直接影响了工程的进度，使工程陷于被动。这是多么严重的损失呵！
    我省白沙、板桥水库工程负责机关，于一九五一年冬派人到上海慈丰、曹顺太等车料厂定制了三千三百副架子车天心花古同。这些厂商探得这一采购情报后，认为是一块“大肥肉”，蜂拥包围我采购员，争着要吃这块“大肥肉”。他们和大掮客李汉民、林威、唐牟等勾通，普遍提高单价十万元，共攫取暴利三亿三千万元。更严重的是偷工减料；利和等钢丝工厂所承包的钢丝十万根，全是镀条，且不合尺码，使我损失三千万元。慈丰车料厂所承制的一千副架子车上的弹子架，规定用好货，每副比一般工厂所制的货贵七万五千元，但只有少数（约三百副）用了好货，骗盗我治淮经费七千五百万元。
    我省治淮总部和白沙水库一九五一年曾在上海买得兴大等汽车行汽车十二部，就有半数是残破旧货装饰冒新的。其中白沙水库于十一月份购买兴大汽车行一部中型吉普车，该行进货价是五千四百万元，以八千一百万元售给我们。这部汽车从上海用火车运到许昌后，要往白沙水库开，但根本不能发动，不得不由白沙水库派来十轮卡车把它拖回白沙。
    大奸商李汉民是个多年的大掮客，于一九五一年春引诱我省治淮采购人员得手后，更大肆骗窃我治淮资财。他和中和、华信等五金号、大明汽车材料行及掮客闻剑华、林威、唐牟等组织盗窃集团，经他手所开的空头假发票就有四十亿元。为了盗窃治淮财产，他竟以解放后逃跑无影的新生五金号空白发票来骗盗我治淮财产，以低价买进，再以百倍暴利转账，骗售给我方。偷工减料、偷梁换柱更属常事。一年来，我省治淮总部及各水库在上海所用的五百亿元的采购巨款，多半由他经手。初步调查，该犯及其组织的盗窃集团，骗盗去了我一百亿元以上的款项。他经手采购的器材，多半残破。仅白沙水库即有近四十亿元的器材，是残旧破货，使工程受到严重损失。他对我省治淮工程阴谋破坏，实属罪大恶极，现已被上海公安总局逮捕，将依法惩办。
    上海奸商们对我省治淮工程的猖狂破坏事实很多，不胜枚举。其中已有大部分人来坦白认错，我们将视情节轻重，坦白程度，报请上海市人民政府及增产节约委员会分别适当处理。但尚有少数奸商拒不坦白，仍企图以狡猾、欺诈手段混过，这里必须提醒他们：拒不坦白，顽抗反盗窃运动，只会受到严重处分。我们决不会让你们骗哄、逃躲过去！
    最后，我们要大声向全国同胞呼吁：请大家注视不法商人们对治淮工程的猖狂破坏，检举他们的罪行，一致团结起来，予奸商们以坚强的反击，粉碎他们的进攻，为保证伟大治淮工程的顺利完成和淮河流域五千多万同胞的幸福生活而斗争！
