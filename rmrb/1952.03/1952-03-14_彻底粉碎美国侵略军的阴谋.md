The extremely brutal American aggressors, disregarding the just warnings of the people of the world, dared to defy the world's condemnation during the Korean armistice negotiations, and frantically and blatantly used bacteriological weapons in Korea to slaughter and harm the Korean people. Furthermore, they have intensified their actions and expanded the scope of this inhumane bacteriological warfare to the territory of our great motherland. This heinous crime of trampling on international conventions and destroying human happiness is absolutely intolerable to the people of our country and the people of the world. We must settle accounts for their crimes, cut off their bloody hands, and give them a devastating blow.

The American aggressors vainly attempt to dominate the world and have used weapons in Korea that were not used in World War II, but to no avail. All their so-called "advantages" and all their conspiracies and tricks have been completely crushed and defeated by the powerful blows of our Chinese and Korean people and under the unanimous condemnation and denunciation of the people of the world. The dream of monopolizing atomic weapons has also been declared bankrupt. At their wit's end and without any other recourse, the American imperialists have brought out their most brutal, savage, and despicable bacteriological weapons, which they have long intended to use and have prepared for over a long period of time. But this inhuman action will never save them from their dying fate. On the contrary, it will allow the people of the world to thoroughly see the hideous faces and the ferocious nature of these man-eating barbarians, these stranglers and executioners of justice. It will arouse the boundless hatred and anger of the people of the world even more. Look! Every corner of the world is already boiling, issuing angry roars, unanimously and severely condemning and denouncing this small group of despicable warmongers. These man-eating demons are trembling before the people of the world, becoming more and more isolated and desperate. The fate of failure and destruction will come to their heads even faster.

The Chinese people, who have stood up, have full strength and confidence to crush all the provocations and acts of aggression by the American aggressors. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's second serious protest on March 8th fully represents the will, strength, and confidence of our people. The democratic parties of China also issued a protest on the same day, calling on peace-loving people all over the world to immediately mobilize and stop this insane crime of the American aggressors. Our people across the country should strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea with the greatest strength to thoroughly smash the American aggressors' attempt and conspiracy to prolong and expand the war of aggression. Let the students, youth, workers, and women of the country act in unison, and with a hundred times the effort, thoroughly complete the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Vigorously increase production and practice economy, study hard, and be prepared to respond to the call of the motherland at any time to go to Korea and the Northeast to participate in on-the-spot epidemic prevention and pest control work. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, let us unite more closely with the people of the world to assist the Chinese and Korean People's Army in giving the deadly enemy of the people of the world, the American imperialists, a devastating blow!

    彻底粉碎美国侵略军的阴谋
    北京大学校长  马寅初
    残暴透顶的美国侵略者不顾全世界人民的正义警告，在朝鲜停战谈判进行期间，竟敢冒天下之大不韪，丧心病狂地、明目张胆地在朝鲜使用细菌武器来屠杀残害朝鲜人民。近而更变本加厉地把这个灭绝人性的细菌战的范围扩大到我们伟大的祖国领土上来了。这种蹂躏国际公约、破坏人类幸福的滔天罪行，是我国人民以及全世界人民绝对不能容忍的。我们要清算它的罪行，斩断它的血手，予以毁灭性的打击。
    美国侵略者妄想独霸全世界，在朝鲜曾经使用了第二次大战时所未曾使用过的武器，但终于无济于事，一切所谓“优势”，一切阴谋诡计，在我们中朝人民有力的打击下，在全世界人民一致的声讨和谴责下，完全被粉碎了，被打垮了。而垄断原子武器的迷梦也宣告破产了。穷途末路，无计可施，美帝国主义乃将它蓄意已久、经过长期准备的最残暴、最野蛮、最卑鄙无耻的细菌武器拿出来了。但这种毫无人性的行动绝挽救不了它那垂死的命运，反而更能让全世界人民彻底地看到这些吃人生番、这些正义的绞杀者和刽子手们的狰狞面目和穷凶极恶的本质，更会激起全世界人民的无比的仇恨和愤怒。看吧！全世界每个角落里都已经沸腾起来了，发出了愤怒的吼声，一致严厉地斥责和声讨这一小撮卑鄙无耻的战争贩子们。这些吃人的恶魔在全世界人民面前发抖了，愈益孤立和绝望了，失败和灭亡的命运就会更快的降临到他们的头上。
    站起来了的中国人民，有充分的力量和信心来粉碎美国侵略者一切挑衅和侵略行为。我外交部周恩来部长于三月八日作了第二次严重抗议，充分代表了我国人民的意志、力量和信心。我中国各民主党派亦于同日提出抗议，向全世界爱好和平的人民呼吁，立即动员起来，制止美国侵略者这种疯狂的罪行。我全国人民更应以最大的力量加强抗美援朝的工作，来彻底粉碎美国侵略者延长和扩大侵略战争的企图和阴谋。让我们全国的学生、青年、工人、妇女们一致行动起来，以百倍的努力，彻底完成反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。厉行增产节约，努力学习，准备随时响应祖国的号召，去朝鲜及东北，参加实地的防疫杀虫工作。在毛主席和共产党的领导下，更紧密地团结起来和全世界人民一道，协助中朝人民部队，给全世界人民的死敌美帝国主义者以毁灭性的打击！
