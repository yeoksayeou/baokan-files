    Learning from the Photo Reporting Style of Hebei Daily
    Newspapers systematically organize photos by opening up columns, focusing on the central work of the locality, reflecting local advanced production experiences, mass activities, and people's lives. This not only helps to promote advanced experiences but also enables the local masses to more deeply understand the significance of creative work. This is an important method for newspaper picture workers to fulfill their propaganda tasks. The advantage of this photo reporting style is that it allows readers to gain a systematic impression.
    Hebei Daily has achieved relatively good results in this regard. On January 17th of this year, the newspaper published a set of photos of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative. From these photos, we can see how the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative rationally used land, labor, agricultural tools, and production funds to achieve the goal of developing productive forces and increasing output. At the same time, we can also see that the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative is a mutual aid form that guides the vast number of farmers from the individual economy to the transition of agricultural collectivization. This points out the path and direction for agricultural production development to local farmers.
    On January 19th, the newspaper published another set of photos, "Labor Model Gao Guandou Helps Farmers Transform Alkaline Land." The content of this set of photos is to introduce how Gao Guandou, a labor model from Shen County, Hebei Province, under the leadership of the Party, went to various villages to mobilize the masses and help them realize the county's plan to transform 10,000 mu of alkaline land. The persuasiveness of this set of photos is very strong, giving farmers confidence to complete the 1952 production increase and conservation plan under difficult conditions.
    On February 9th, the photos of "The Actual Situation of State-Run Jiheng Farm Using Machines for Farming" published by the newspaper correctly demonstrated the superiority of machine farming, pointing out the prospect of agricultural mechanization to farmers.
    Because the photographers who took these photos have certain agricultural knowledge, are familiar with the local situation, and the materials selected are understood and concerned by local farmers, the publicity and educational significance of these photos to local farmers is very significant.
    However, some of these photos are not expressed concisely and powerfully enough, some are somewhat formulaic in form, and the organic connection between the photos is not expressed well enough. Therefore, very touching things often appear dull and rigid in the photos, which should be improved.
    Overall, the photo reporting style of Hebei Daily is very good. Newspapers in various places should, within the limits of their material conditions, refer to these experiences to improve their picture work.

    学习河北日报的照片报道方式
    报纸用辟栏的形式将照片有系统地组织起来，围绕当地的中心工作，反映当地的生产先进经验、群众活动和人民生活，不仅有助于先进经验的推广，而且能够使当地群众更深刻地认识创造性的工作的意义。这是报纸图片工作者实现自己的宣传任务的重要方法。这种照片报道方式的好处是能够使读者获得系统的印象。
    河北日报在这方面是做得比较有成绩的。今年一月十七日该报刊登了一套耿长锁农业生产合作社的照片。从这套照片，可以看出耿长锁农业生产合作社怎样合理地使用了土地、劳力、农具和生产资金，而达到了发展生产力提高产量的目的；同时还可以看出耿长锁农业生产合作社乃是引导广大农民从个体经济走向农业集体化的过渡的互助形式。这就给当地农民指出了农业生产发展的道路和方向。
    一月十九日该报又刊登了一套“劳动模范高贯斗帮助农民改造硷地”的照片。这套照片的内容，是介绍河北省深县劳动模范高贯斗怎样在党的领导下，到各村去发动群众、帮助群众来实现全县改造一万亩硷地计划的。这套照片的说服力是很强的，它使得农民有信心在困难的条件下来完成一九五二年的增产节约计划。
    二月九日该报刊登的“国营冀衡农场使用机器耕作实况”的照片，正确地表现了机器耕种的优越性，给农民指出了农业机械化的远景。
    由于摄制这些照片的摄影记者具有一定的农业知识，熟悉当地的情况，所选择的材料又是为当地农民所了解和关心的，所以摄制的这些照片，对于当地农民的宣传和教育意义是很大的。
    但是，在这些照片中，有些还表现得不够概括有力，在形式上也有些公式化，照片之间的有机联系也表现得不够，因此往往使得很动人的事物，反映在照片上反而显得枯涩和刻板了，这是应该加以改进的。
    总的说来，河北日报的这种照片报道方式是很好的。各地报纸应该在物质条件许可的情况下，参照这些经验，把自己的图片工作做得更好。
