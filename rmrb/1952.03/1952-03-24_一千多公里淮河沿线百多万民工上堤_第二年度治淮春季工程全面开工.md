Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, March 22nd: The second year of the Huai River harnessing spring project has fully commenced. Eight hundred thousand laborers from the Subei districts of Yancheng, Huaiyin, Taizhou, and others have been working diligently on the Subei Irrigation Main Canal construction site for a month. Ninety thousand laborers from thirteen counties including Yuxian and Changge in Henan Province, along with thousands of transportation workers from Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and other locations, have all rushed to the Baisha Reservoir construction site, which is scheduled to be fully completed before this year's flood season. Nearly one million laborers from the Wanbei districts of Suxian, Fuyang, and others are also continuously arriving at the embankment. In total, the number of laborers on the 1,000-plus kilometer-long Huai River harnessing construction site has reached over one million.

The second year of the Huai River harnessing project comprehensively began in November last year. One-third of the entire year's project was completed last winter. The main tasks for this spring's Huai River harnessing project are: Henan must complete the construction of the Baisha Reservoir and Banqiao Reservoir before the flood season; continue to dredge the riverbeds of the Huai River tributaries such as the Hong River, Ru River, and Ying River. Wanbei must vigorously construct the gigantic Foziling Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Pi River within Huoshan County; continue to dredge and reorganize more than ten Huai River tributaries such as the Xifei River, Tuo River, Chong River, and Tong River; continue to construct the diversion projects of the Huai River tributaries and main streams below Wuhe County, as well as the flood storage projects for the Wabu Lake and Menghe lowlands. Subei will continue to vigorously excavate the Subei Irrigation Main Canal. During the second year of the Huai River harnessing spring project, farmers will also be mobilized to widely build terraced fields, dig ponds, build weirs, construct dams, and excavate ditches in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the river. In addition, more than twenty large culverts will be built in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River.

After the commencement of the second year of the Huai River harnessing spring project, several major wind and snowstorms were encountered, which severely hindered the construction. However, the laborers, disregarding the cold weather, persisted in their labor. In Wanbei, the laborers from Huaiyuan County, while dredging the Chong River and Tong River, swept away the snow and dug the earth as soon as the snow stopped. Laborer Zhang Dayou broke the three-inch-thick ice to work underwater for two hours in order to quickly complete the water diversion pool for installing the water pump.

Currently, on the Subei Irrigation Main Canal construction site, where work started earlier, a heated labor competition has been launched among the 800,000 laborers. Each labor team has formulated a competition plan. For example, the more than 36,000 laborers in Sheyang County, through detailed accounting and tapping potential, plan to save 300,000 workdays in this spring's project. Since the start of the competition, labor efficiency has been continuously improved at various construction sites. The earthwork done by laborers in Taizhou, Yancheng, and other districts has increased from an average of one cubic meter per person per day to two cubic meters. The advanced labor groups of Ji Penghao in Huaian County and Ding Guangfu in Gaoyou County have reached more than four cubic meters. At present, the spring project in Yancheng District has completed 5 million cubic meters of earthwork; Taizhou District has completed 4 million cubic meters.

Representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers who returned home visited the Huai River harnessing construction sites and delivered reports to the laborers. Their reports greatly inspired the laborers' enthusiasm for work. The more than one million laborers participating in the spring project have universally proposed: We must learn from the heroic combat spirit of the Volunteers and strive to complete the Huai River harnessing task as soon as possible.

    一千多公里淮河沿线百多万民工上堤
    第二年度治淮春季工程全面开工
    【新华社蚌埠二十二日电】第二年度治淮春季工程已全面开工。苏北区盐城、淮阴、泰州等专区的八十万民工，已在苏北灌溉总渠工地上紧张地工作了一个月。河南省禹县、长葛等十三个县的九万民工，和开封、郑州等地的数千运输工人，都已赶到今年汛期前要全部修成的白沙水库工地。皖北区宿县、阜阳等专区的近百万民工，也正络绎上堤。总计现在在一千多公里长的治淮工地上，上堤民工已达一百多万人。
    第二年度治淮工程是在去年十一月全面开工的，去年冬季已完成全年工程的三分之一。今年春季治淮工程主要是：河南要在汛期前完成白沙水库和板桥水库的建库工程；继续整理洪河、汝河、颍河等淮河支流的河道。皖北要大力修建霍山县境淠河上游的巨型佛子岭水库；继续疏浚并整理西淝河、沱河、漴河、潼河等十多条淮河支流；继续修五河县以下的淮河支干流分流工程，以及瓦埠湖、蒙河洼地等蓄洪工程。苏北仍是大力开挖苏北灌溉总渠。第二年度治淮春季工程中，还将要在上游、中游发动农民普遍修建谷坊，挖塘，筑堰，打坝和开挖沟洫。另外，淮河上游、中游和下游地区还要修建二十多处较大的涵闸。
    第二年度治淮春季工程动工后，接连遇到了几场较大的风雪，施工受到严重的阻碍。但是，民工们不顾天寒地冻，仍然坚持着他们的劳动。皖北怀远县民工在疏浚漴河、潼河中，风雪一停即扫雪挖土。民工张大友为争取很快修成安装抽水机用的引水池，打破了三寸厚的冰下水劳动达两小时。
    现在，开工较早的苏北灌溉总渠的工地上，八十万民工中已热烈地开展了互相的劳动竞赛。各民工队都订了竞赛计划。如射阳县三万六千多民工，通过算细账，发掘了潜在力量，计划在今春工程中节约三十万个工作日。竞赛开始各工地上劳动效率不断提高。泰州、盐城等专区民工所做的土方工程，已由每人每天平均一公方提高到二公方。淮安县纪彭高民工组和高邮县的丁广富等先进民工小组已达四公方以上。现在盐城专区的春季工程已完成土工五百万公方；泰州专区已完成了四百万公方。
    中国人民志愿军归国代表到了治淮各工地并向民工们做了报告，他们的报告大大地鼓舞了民工的劳动热情。参加春季工程的一百多万民工，都普遍提出：要学习志愿军的英勇作战精神，争取早日完成治淮任务。
