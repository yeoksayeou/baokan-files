    Communist Party Members in Rural Areas Actively Mobilize to Lead Farmers in Drought Prevention and Resistance, Preparing for Spring Planting
    (This article can be used by rural Party branches to mobilize Party members and the masses for drought prevention and resistance)

    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Decision on Vigorously Launching a Mass Drought Prevention and Resistance Movement" on February 8th, and our Party Central Committee also issued instructions on ensuring the implementation of the Government Administration Council's decision on drought prevention and resistance. Rural Party organizations and members should, in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council and the Party Central Committee, lead all farmers in launching a mass drought prevention and resistance and spring plowing campaign to ensure timely planting.

    (I) Drought Prevention, Resistance, and Spring Planting are the Most Urgent Tasks in Rural Areas Currently

    Last year, 22 provinces and regions across the country suffered from drought. More than 125 million mu of land were affected by drought, and 35 million mu were severely affected, resulting in a reduction of over 8 billion jin of grain. Not only did Inner Mongolia, Chahar, and Suiyuan, which are prone to drought, suffer, but even Jiangxi and northern Sichuan, which usually have ample rainfall, also experienced drought. Chahar province, which was hardest hit, experienced severe drought in 25 out of 30 counties. In June and July, when crops needed rain the most, the weather was dry and hot with no rainfall, and crops grew only a foot tall before heading. As a result, the entire province harvested 50% less grain. In Jiangxi, from May to September last year, there was very little rainfall. Some rivers, ponds, and wells dried up, and rice seedlings in many paddy fields were scorched. This was the worst drought in Jiangxi in ten years.

    Last autumn, there was little rainfall in various places. Since the beginning of winter, there has been very little snowfall. On February 13th and 14th this year, there was a snowfall in various places, but it was not heavy. Especially in many provinces in the north, there was very little snowfall. On February 23rd and 24th, there was another snowfall in various places. The snowfall was heavier in the Northwest and Central South regions, but smaller in North China. In Chahar Province, the snow barely covered the ground. The above situation tells us that the soil in many places is dry this year.

    Dry soil naturally brings many difficulties to spring planting. The spring plowing season has arrived. Places in the north where the ground has thawed should start spring plowing. If we do not quickly think of ways to prevent and resist drought, we will not be able to guarantee timely spring plowing and planting, which will affect this year's agricultural production and affect the increase in yield per unit area. Now that the Korean front is still fighting, the country also needs to carry out construction. The task facing the people of the whole country is: "Increase production, practice thrift, and support the Volunteer Army." This year's agricultural production requires an increase of 8% in grain production and 20% in cotton production on the basis of last year's production. Hebei Province alone is required to increase grain production by 3.4 billion jin and cotton production by 800,000 jin compared with last year. If agriculture cannot increase production this year, or even produces less grain and less cotton, it will not only affect the lives of the farmers themselves, but also affect the entire country. Because less grain will directly affect the grain supply of the people across the country and the Volunteer Army fighting in the icy and snowy weather; less cotton will affect the operation of factories. Wouldn't this weaken the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea and weaken the strength of the country to carry out economic construction?

    (II) Last Year's Drought Prevention and Resistance Experience and This Year's Favorable Conditions

    The task of drought prevention, resistance, and timely spring planting is very urgent. Rural Party organizations and members must actively lead farmers to fight against drought. The experience of drought resistance in various places last year proves that as long as Party organizations and Communist Party members mobilize farmers to organize themselves, make full use of above-ground and underground water sources, and think of various ways to prevent and resist drought, it is possible to overcome drought. For example, in Hebei Province, most areas suffered from spring drought last year. The Party and the people's government actively led farmers to organize themselves to resist drought and plant cotton. A total of 18 million mu of cotton were planted in the province, and 13 million mu were planted by drought-resistant direct seeding or moisture-seizing sowing. For example, the Party branch of Chenjiawan Village in Wuyi County played a great role in drought resistance. Chenjiawan originally planned to plant 245 mu of cotton, but because the weather was dry and the land was dry, some farmers were afraid that direct seeding would be troublesome and that there would not be enough water, so they wanted to plant less. Seeing that the cotton planting plan could not be completed, the village branch studied and came up with a method of digging wells for direct seeding to persuade farmers. Under the leadership of Party members, the villagers organized 14 direct seeding mutual aid groups, and men, women, old and young all worked together to quickly complete the cotton planting plan. The Chenjiawan Village branch is just one of thousands of village branches in Hebei Province. Because the Party organizations and members in rural Hebei Province led farmers to use various methods to resist drought last year, the province's cotton still achieved rare bumper harvests in the face of drought and lack of rain. Li Hewang, an agricultural labor model and Communist Party member from Chahar Province, led farmers from more than a dozen villages last year during the severe drought to store water and ice and divert water to irrigate the land, ensuring that more than 20,300 mu of arable land were sown on time. Later, he took the lead in irrigating grain to protect seedlings, organized farmers to repair wells, install waterwheels, and dig ditches on riverbeds to divert water for irrigation. In this way, they overcame the drought and achieved a bumper harvest, harvesting 15,000 more shi of grain than the previous year. In Hexi, Gansu Province, because farmers were educated on the rational use of well water and canal water, the water saved in Jiuquan Prefecture alone could irrigate 320,000 mu of land. Under the leadership of the Party and the people's government, farmers in three special districts of Shaanxi Province actively fought against drought and dug 60,000 wells in one month. Last July, the people of Luzhai, Guangxi, who had just overcome a serious insect pest, fought against drought under the active leadership of the county party committee. In just one month, more than 13,800 people were organized in four districts and three towns, carrying more than 181,000 dan of water, building eight new water weirs, repairing thirteen dams, digging three ditches, repairing nine ditches, digging eleven wells, repairing sixty-nine waterwheels, and saving more than 11,400 dan of low-lying and dry fields. In Xining County, Hunan, farmers in every township and village organized water-wheeling teams during the drought resistance. The whole county made sure that no waterwheel was idle, and in some places, no one was idle. The Xiaomu Township in the Second District organized a water-wheeling team of more than 2,560 people, using 193 waterwheels to take turns wheeling water day and night, saving more than 33,600 shi of paddy fields. Women also organized water-carrying teams to save 476 shi of paddy fields. Where there was no ready-made water source for wheeling water, farmers actively developed water sources. Xu Shengyi, a farmer from Yuetang Village, Yancun Township, in the Third District, climbed into a cave more than a mile long to divert water, solving the water shortage problem for more than 800 shi of paddy fields, and was elected as a drought resistance model by the masses.

    This year's drought prevention and resistance spring planting not only has past experience, but also has better conditions for drought prevention and resistance. In particular, land reform has been completed in areas with more than 300 million agricultural population across the country. The farmers have been liberated and are all cultivating their own land. They have a great enthusiasm for production. In addition, during the anti-US aggression and aid Korea movement and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement last year, farmers received political education and increased their patriotic enthusiasm for increasing production. These situations are very conducive to this year's drought prevention and resistance spring planting work, and conducive to the completion of the 1952 agricultural production increase task. Therefore, it is wrong to lack confidence in drought prevention and resistance and spring plowing work.

    (III) The Negative Attitude Towards Drought Prevention, Resistance, and Spring Planting Must Be Corrected

    At present, some Party members, village (township) cadres, and even district cadres in rural areas have a paralyzed thought and think: "It is still early to plant, why should we resist drought now?" "Will it not rain during the year?" These ideas are wrong. As the saying goes, "A year's plan lies in spring." If it does not rain in spring and we do not prevent and resist drought, we will not be able to sow on time and will suffer a great loss. In addition, some district and village (township) cadres do not have enough understanding of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle. They usually have some problems with their style of work, or their hands are not clean. They are afraid that they will be criticized, so they have negative and tired thoughts, waiting for a change of shifts, and some even lie down and do nothing. They do not understand that the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and the instructions of the Party Central Committee have long made it clear that before spring plowing, district and village (township) levels should concentrate their efforts to organize the masses to prevent drought, resist drought, and carry out spring planting. The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement will be carried out after spring planting is completed. A small number of people who have made mistakes or even committed crimes can perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes if they work actively in drought prevention and resistance during spring planting. There are now two clear paths in front of these people: one is to correct their mistakes, start anew, do more things for the masses in drought prevention and resistance spring planting, and strive to take the path of meritorious service to atone for their crimes; the other is to persist in their mistakes, lie down and do nothing in drought prevention and resistance spring planting, make mistakes on top of mistakes, and embark on the path of self-severance from the Party and the masses. We hope that those who have made mistakes will wake up quickly and take the path of meritorious service to atone for their crimes. The government will definitely deal with them leniently.

    (IV) How to Mobilize Farmers to Prevent and Resist Drought, Carry Out Spring Plowing, and Ensure Timely Planting?

    How should Party organizations and members in rural areas mobilize farmers to carry out drought prevention and resistance movements to ensure spring plowing and timely planting?

    First, tell farmers about the drought situation in various places and the significance of drought prevention and resistance, and explain that the spring plowing season has arrived, and it is not early, so we should hurry up and get started. Eliminate farmers' paralysis and fatalistic thoughts. Use the successful facts of drought prevention and resistance in various places to repeatedly explain the truth of "man will conquer nature" to enhance farmers' confidence and determination in drought prevention and resistance. Communist Party members must take the lead in mobilizing farmers to take action to carry out spring plowing and prepare for planting.

    Second, Party members and cadres should lead the masses in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups to discuss and formulate drought prevention and resistance plans, and use various mutual assistance and labor exchange methods to organize all manpower, animal power, full labor force, and semi-labor force to give full play to collective strength to carry out drought prevention, resistance, spring plowing, and planting work. The main things to do are: (1) Make full use of all above-ground and underground water sources to build farmland water conservancy. Of course, this must be done according to the specific conditions of each place. Those close to the river can open canals, build embankments, and repair beaches; places that can store surface water can dig ponds, build dams, and build small reservoirs; places with springs can dig wells. It is also necessary to organize farmers to buy a large number of waterwheels, water bucket wheels, and various water-drawing tools. Existing channels, wells, ponds, etc. should be strengthened management. In terms of water use, Communist Party members should play an exemplary role, taking the lead in mutual assistance and mutual concession, and educate everyone to use water rationally, so as to expand the area of irrigated land with the original water conservancy. (2) Study various drought-resistant technologies. The north should first pay attention to preserving soil moisture, and strive to sow on time. For land that has been autumn-plowed last year, it should be carefully plowed and harrowed more times when it thaws; for land that has not been autumn-plowed, it should be plowed and harrowed at the same time during spring plowing to maintain soil moisture. Where there is moist soil at the time of sowing, it is necessary to seize the moisture and use the moisture for sowing. Where there is no moist soil, it is necessary to organize water carrying and direct seeding. After the crops emerge, it is necessary to lead farmers to weed more and reduce water evaporation.

    农村中的共产党员积极行动起来领导农民防旱抗旱准备春耕播种
    （本文可供农村党支部向党员群众进行防旱抗旱动员时采用）
    中央人民政府政务院在二月八日颁布了关于大力开展群众性的防旱抗旱运动的决定，我们的党中央也发出了关于保证执行政务院防旱抗旱决定的指示，农村的党组织和党员，都应当根据政务院和党中央的指示，领导全体农民，开展群众性的防旱抗旱和春耕运动，保证不误农时，按时播种。
    （一）防旱抗旱、春耕播种是目前农村中最紧要的任务
    去年全国有二十二个省区，受了旱灾。受旱的地面有一亿二千五百多万亩，成灾的地面有三千五百万亩，少打了八十亿斤粮食。这不光是容易受旱的内蒙古、察哈尔、绥远受了旱，就连素来雨水充足的江西、川北也遭了旱。受旱最厉害的察哈尔，三十个县当中有二十五个县是大旱。六、七月里，庄稼正要雨的时候，天气干热不下雨，庄稼长出一尺高，就出了穗。结果全省少打了五成粮食。江西从去年五月到九月，很少下雨，有的河流、池塘、水井都干了，不少地方水田里的稻秧也晒焦了。这在江西，是十年来没有过的旱灾。
    去年秋天，各地下雨不多。入冬到现在，雪也下得很少。今年二月十三、四日，各地下了一场雪，可是下得不大。特别是北方的很多省份，下雪很少。二十三、四日，各地又下了一场雪，西北、中南等地方下得大些，华北地区雪下的小，察哈尔省的雪才刚刚盖住地皮。以上情形，可以告诉我们今年很多地方的土地是干旱的。
    土地干旱，当然给春耕播种带来很多困难。现在已到春耕季节。北方开冻的地方，应该着手春耕了。如果我们不赶紧想法防旱抗旱，就无法保证按时春耕、播种，就会影响今年的农业生产，影响提高单位面积产量。现在朝鲜前线还在打仗，国家也要进行建设。摆在全国人民面前的任务是：“增加生产，厉行节约，以支援志愿军”。今年的农业生产，要求在去年生产的基础上，增产粮食百分之八，增产棉花百分之二十。只河北一个省就要求比去年增产粮食三十四亿斤，棉花八十万斤。如果今年农业不能增产，甚至少打了粮食，少收了棉花，不光要影响农民自己的生活，而且要影响整个国家。因为粮食少了，就直接影响到全国人民和战斗在冰天雪地的志愿军的粮食供给；棉花少了，就影响到工厂的开工。这样不就减弱了抗美援朝的力量，减弱了国家进行经济建设的力量吗？
    （二）去年防旱抗旱的经验和今年的有利条件
    防旱抗旱按时春耕播种的任务很紧迫，农村的党组织和党员必须积极领导农民向旱灾作斗争。去年各地抗旱的经验证明：只要党组织和共产党员发动农民组织起来，充分利用地上地下的水源，想各种办法防旱抗旱，是可以战胜旱灾的。比方河北省，去年大部分地方春旱，党和人民政府就积极领导农民组织起来，抗旱种棉。全省一共种了一千八百万亩棉花，有一千三百万亩是抗旱点种或是抢墒播种的。像武邑县陈家湾的党支部，就在抗旱中起了很大的作用。陈家湾原来计划种棉花二百四十五亩，可是因为天旱地干，有些农民又怕点种费事、怕水不够用，想少种。眼看着种棉计划不能完成。这时村支部就研究出挖井点种的办法，去说服农民。在党员带动下，全村农民组织起十四个点种互助组，男女老少齐下手，很快把种棉计划完成了。陈家湾村支部只不过是河北省千万个村支部中的一个。由于河北省农村的党组织和党员去年领导农民用各种办法抗旱，使全省棉花在天旱缺雨的情况下，还达到了过去少有的丰收。察哈尔省的农业劳动模范、共产党员李河旺，在去年大旱中，领导十多村农民蓄水养冰和打冰漕引水浇地，保证了两万零三百多亩耕地按时下种。后来他又带头浇谷保苗，组织农民修井、安水车和在河床上掘沟引水浇地。这样，他们就战胜了旱灾，得到了丰收，比前年多打了一万五千石粮食。甘肃省河西，因为向农民进行了合理使用井水、渠水的教育，只酒泉专区节省的水，就可多浇三十二万亩地。陕西省三个专区的农民，在党和人民政府领导下，积极抗旱，一个月就打了六万眼井。去年七月，刚战胜了严重虫灾的广西鹿寨人民，在县委积极领导下，又同旱灾进行搏斗。只一个月，就在四个区、三个镇组织了一万三千八百多人，挑水十八万一千多担，筑新水堰八个，修水坝十三个，挖水沟三条，修水沟九条，挖井十一个，修水车六十九个，救活了一万一千四百多担凹地和旱田。湖南新宁县在抗旱中，每个乡、村的农民都组织了车水队。全县做到不闲一辆水车，有的地方还作到不闲一个人。二区小木乡组织了二千五百六十多人的车水队，用一百九十三架水车，日夜不停地轮流车水，共抢救了三万三千六百多石谷田。妇女也组织了挑水队，抢救谷田四百七十六石田。没有现成水源车水的地方，农民积极地开辟水源。三区烟村乡月塘村农民许盛亿，爬进一里多长的岩洞里去引水，解决了八百多石谷田缺水的困难，被群众选为抗旱模范。
    今年防旱抗旱春耕播种，不光有了过去的经验，而且有了防旱抗旱的更好的条件。特别是全国已经在三万万以上农业人口地区完成了土地改革，农民翻了身，都耕种着自己的土地，他们的生产劲头很大，再加上去年进行的抗美援朝运动和镇压反革命运动中，农民受到了政治教育，提高了爱国丰产热情，这些情况，极有利于今年防旱抗旱春耕播种的工作，有利于一九五二年的农业增产任务的完成。因此，对防旱抗旱和春耕工作缺少信心，是不对的。
    （三）对防旱抗旱春耕播种的消极态度必须纠正
    现在农村里有些党员、村（乡）干部，甚至区干部，有着麻痹思想，觉得：“种地还早呢，现在为什么要抗旱？”“一年当中还能不下雨？”这些想法都是错误的。俗语说：“一年之计在于春”，春天如果不下雨，我们再不防旱抗旱，就不能按时下种，就要吃大亏了。另外还有一些区、村（乡）干部对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的认识不够，他们平日作风有些毛病，或者手头不干净，怕斗到自己头上，因而存在着消极疲塌思想，等待着换班，有的甚至躺倒不干了。他们不了解：中央人民政府政务院的决定和党中央的指示早已明白指出：区级和村（乡）级在春耕以前，应该集中力量组织群众防旱抗旱进行春耕播种，反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动要等春耕播种完了再进行。少数曾犯错误甚至犯罪的人，如果在防旱抗旱春耕中，积极工作，可以立功赎罪。现在很明显地摆在这些人眼前有两条路：一条是在防旱抗旱春耕播种中，痛改前非，重新作人，多给群众作些事情，争取走立功赎罪的路；一条是坚持错误，在防旱抗旱春耕播种中躺倒不干，错上加错，走上自绝于党和群众的路。我们希望犯过错误的人，赶快觉醒起来，走立功赎罪的路，政府一定会从宽处理的。
    （四）怎样发动农民防旱抗旱进行春耕、保证按时播种呢
    农村里的党组织和党员应该怎样发动农民开展防旱抗旱运动，保证春耕和按时播种？
    第一、告诉农民各地方受旱的情形和防旱抗旱的意义，说明现在春耕季节已经到了，时候不早了，应该赶快动手。打消农民麻痹和听天由命的思想。用各地防旱抗旱成功的事实，反复说明“人定胜天”的道理，增强农民防旱抗旱的信心和决心。共产党员要带头发动农民行动起来进行春耕，准备播种。
    第二、党员和干部要在农业生产合作社和互助组中，领导群众讨论和制订防旱抗旱计划，要用各种互助变工的办法，把一切人力、畜力、整劳动力、半劳动力组织起来，发挥集体力量，进行防旱抗旱春耕播种工作。主要要做：（一）充分利用一切地上地下的水源，兴修农田水利。当然这要按照各地具体的情况去作。靠着河近的可以开渠、垒堰、修滩；能够存储地面上的水的地方，可以挖塘、修坝、修小水库；有泉眼的地方，可以打井。还要组织农民大量买水车、水筒车和各种汲水的工具。已有的渠道、水井、塘等应该加强管理。在用水方面，共产党员应该起模范作用，带头互助互让，并教育大家合理用水，这样来扩大原有水利浇地的面积。（二）研究各种抗旱技术。北方首先注意保墒。争取按时播种。去年曾经进行秋耕的地，开冻就要细耕多耙；没有进行秋耕的地，春耕时要随耕随耙，这样来保持土地水分。播种的时候有墒土的地方，要抢墒、借墒进行播种，没墒土的地方，要组织挑水点种。庄稼出苗以后，要领导农民多锄草、减少水分蒸发。
