    I am willing to stand on the front line of the counterattack against the US imperialist germ aggression war
    Jin Baoshan, Director of the Technology Department of the Central Ministry of Health
    Bacteriologist
    Since the heinous American invading army launched a bacteriological war in Korea on January 28, 1952, it has recently intensified its actions and increasingly frantically spread the flames of bacteriological warfare to the northeastern region of our country. This heinous and brutal behavior is intolerable to the Chinese people, and especially abhorrent to those who study bacteriology and preventive medicine.
    Since the beginning of human history, poisonous insects and bacteria have wreaked havoc and opposed human life. Human ancestors created science through labor. Medical, bacteriological, and biological scientists work diligently day and night to study methods of eliminating and preventing these threats to protect human health. Now, the evil American invading army has lost its humanity, stolen the achievements of science, and turned them against humanity. It is especially abhorrent that a group of "bacterial experts" under the command of Sames, the director of the "Public Health Bureau" of the American invading army headquarters, used prisoners of war as experimental subjects for bacterial weapons on the American bacterial landing craft No. 1091. This inhuman behavior, more ferocious than that of wild beasts, is outrageous.
    Although insects and bacteria are sufficient to spread epidemics and endanger human health, the progress of modern preventive medicine, bacteriology, biology, and epidemiology has enabled us to master powerful defensive weapons. Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, in the short span of two years, 77 million rats have been caught in plague-stricken areas, controlling the spread of the plague. Smallpox vaccination has been widely carried out in most areas, and smallpox is no longer prevalent; cholera has never occurred. These are clear examples that epidemics can be absolutely eradicated. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, scientists and the working people are closely united, and any harm can be eliminated.
    The enemy's bloody claws have reached our side. Medical and health workers must no longer be complacent and should immediately take action. On the one hand, we must strengthen research, improve epidemic prevention technology, and increase the production of epidemic prevention drugs to make powerful preparations for defending against germ warfare. On the other hand, we must carry out epidemic prevention propaganda, popularize epidemic prevention training, and fully mobilize the masses so that every working person becomes a heroic fighter against germ warfare.
    Bacterial weapons can pose a certain threat when people are not vigilant and unprepared. However, bacterial weapons are not some great and mysterious tactic. As long as everyone is united and takes active practical actions, they can be destroyed. I am willing to stand on the front line of the counterattack against the US imperialist germ aggression war, smash the US imperialist's arrogant attempt, and prevent the American aggressors from gaining any advantage in carrying out germ warfare.

    我愿站在反击美帝国主义细菌侵略战的最前线
    中央卫生部技术室主任
    细菌学家  金宝善
    罪恶滔天的美国侵略军，自一九五二年一月二十八日在朝鲜发动了细菌战之后，最近更变本加厉，愈益疯狂地将细菌战的毒焰，延烧到我国境内东北地区。这种穷凶极恶的残暴行为，是中国人民所不能容忍的，尤其是研究细菌学和预防医学者所深恶痛绝的。
    人类自有史以来，即有毒虫细菌肆逞毒害，与人类生命为敌。人类的祖先以劳动创造了科学，医学、细菌学，生物学者日夜辛勤地工作，研究消灭、防御的方法，以保障人类的健康。现在万恶的美国侵略军灭绝了人性，窃取了科学的成果，反用以残杀人类。尤其可恶的，美国侵略军总部“公共卫生局”局长塞姆斯所指挥的一群“细菌专家”在美国一○九一号细菌登陆艇上，将战俘作为细菌武器的试验品，这种比野兽更凶恶的非人行为，令人发指。
    昆虫细菌，虽然足以传播疫病、危害人类的健康，但近代预防医学、细菌学、生物学、流行病学的进步，已使我们能够掌握有力的防御武器。自中央人民政府成立以来，在短短的两年时间内，在鼠疫流行地区，已捕了七千七百万头鼠，控制了鼠疫的传播，多数地区普遍地种了牛痘，天花就不再流行；霍乱始终没有发生，这就是疫病绝对可以扑灭的明显例证。在毛主席、共产党的领导下，科学工作者和劳动人民紧紧地团结在一起，任何危害没有不可消灭的。
    敌人的血腥魔爪已伸到我们身边，医药卫生工作者决不能再有麻痹思想，应该立即行动起来，一方面加强研究工作，提高防疫技术，增产防疫药品，作好防御细菌战的有力准备。另一方面开展防疫宣传，普及防疫训练，充分地发动群众，使每个劳动人民都成为防御细菌战的英勇战士。
    细菌武器在人们没有警惕，不加防备的条件下，是可以造成一定的威胁的。但是细菌武器，也不是有什么了不起的奥妙战术，只要大家万众一心、积极地采取实际行动，是一定可以摧毁的。我愿站在反击美帝国主义细菌侵略战的最前线，粉碎美帝国主义的狂妄企图，使美国侵略者在进行细菌战中找不到一点便宜。
