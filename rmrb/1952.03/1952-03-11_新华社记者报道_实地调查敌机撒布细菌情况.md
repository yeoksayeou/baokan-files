    Xinhua News Agency Report
    On-the-Spot Investigation of Enemy Aircraft Spreading Bacteria

    [Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 10th] Our reporter reported on the 27th of February on an on-the-spot investigation of enemy aircraft spreading bacteria in Inhung-ri, near Munchon on the east coast, saying: "When reporters arrived in the epidemic area, local residents told us: 'On the night of February 26th, enemy aircraft circled over this area for a long time, but neither dropped bombs nor strafed; everyone felt very strange. The next morning, many insects were suddenly found nearby.'"
    Our group walked from east to west through a large gully. Before we had gone far, flies that could fly appeared beside our feet. After walking another two hundred meters or so, we came to a relatively open area. To the north was a mountain peak 528 meters above sea level, and to the south were several small hillsides. In the middle was a cornfield covered with thick white snow. This cornfield was covered with clusters of small, jumping black insects. These small black insects were like fleas, but different in shape, with two antennae in front, a slender body, six legs, and two tails in the back, covered with hair. We stepped through the snow, which was about seven inches deep, to examine them personally. In addition, we also found many flies and mosquitoes. We continued to walk along the foot of the mountain. On the left side of the path we were walking on was a sunny hillside with no snow, and on the right was a dry gully. At this time, the sun had come out, and there were many insects moving along the road. We then split up to investigate, and found a large number of flies, mosquitoes, sandflies, spiders, and black-capped insects in the withered grass on the hillside and on the edge of the road to the right, jumping and crawling everywhere; at the same time, there were also two kinds of unnamed insects, one somewhat like a spider, with particularly long legs and patterns on its back, and the other like an ant, with two thorns on its back.
    Later, we interviewed the Korean villagers in nearby villages. Many Korean elders in their forties and fifties came out enthusiastically to greet us. They confirmed: "American planes circled in the sky for a long time that night, and the next day we found many insects." When we showed them the eight kinds of insects in glass bottles, they pointed to one like a spider and one like an ant and said: "We have never seen these two kinds of insects here, and the other insects are not able to grow in this season." They also expressed their determination to work with the troops to thoroughly eliminate the bacteria-carrying pests spread by the American aggressors.

    实地调查敌机撒布细菌情况
    【新华社朝鲜前线十日电】本社记者报道二月二十七日在东海岸文川附近的仁兴里实地调查敌机撒布细菌的情况称：当记者到达疫区后，当地的居民告诉我们说：“二月廿六日夜间，敌机在这一带上空盘旋了很久，可是既未投弹，也未扫射；大家感到很奇怪。第二天早晨就在附近突然发现了许多虫子。”
    我们一行人从一个大山沟里由东往西走，没走多久，脚旁就出现了能飞的苍蝇，又走了二百多公尺，到了一块比较开阔的地方。它的北面是一座拔海五百二十八公尺的山峰，南面是几个小山坡，中间是积着厚厚的白雪的苞米地。就在这块苞米地上，布满了一簇簇能跳跃的小黑虫。这种小黑虫像跳蚤似的，但形状不同，前面有两条须，身子细长，有六条腿，后面还有两个尾巴，身上都是毛。我们踏着约有七寸深的积雪，亲自去察看了一番。另外，我们也发现很多苍蝇和蚊子。我们又沿着山脚继续往前走。我们走的小路的左边是已经没有积雪的向阳的山坡，右边是一条已经干涸的山沟。这时，太阳已经出来，路旁有许多虫子在钻动。我们便又分头察看，在山坡上的枯草里和右边路沿上发现有大量的苍蝇、蚊子、白蛉子、蜘蛛和黑盖虫，到处乱蹦乱爬；同时还有两种无名虫子，一种有些像蜘蛛，腿特别长，背上有花纹，还有一种像蚂蚁，背上有两根刺。
    以后我们访问了附近村子里的朝鲜老乡。许多四、五十岁的朝鲜父老都热情地出来招待我们。他们证实说：“美国飞机那天晚上在天空中转了许久，第二天我们就发现了许多虫子。”我们拿出装在玻璃瓶里的八种虫子给他们看时，他们指着一种像蜘蛛和一种像蚂蚁的虫子说：“我们这里从来没有见过这两种虫，另外那些虫子也不是这个季节里能生长的。”他们并表示要和部队一起，坚决把这些美国侵略者撒布的细菌毒虫彻底消灭干净。
