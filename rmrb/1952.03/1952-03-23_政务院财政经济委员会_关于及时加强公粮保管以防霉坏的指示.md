The Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee
Instructions on Strengthening Grain Storage in a Timely Manner to Prevent Mold and Spoilage

Last autumn's grain collection, propelled by the great patriotic movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, saw localities complete their grain collection tasks in a timely manner, and the quality of the grain was also much better than in the past. This is a great achievement. However, after a large amount of grain entered storage, due to our poor storage conditions, insufficient warehouses, lack of storage knowledge, and insufficient storage equipment and medicines, the phenomenon of grain mold and spoilage still occurs frequently. At present, most government institutions above the prefectural level across the country have launched or are launching the Three-Anti Campaign. Corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the grain departments must be thoroughly eliminated in this campaign. This will greatly reduce losses in our national grain storage and greatly improve our work. However, precisely because we are concentrating our efforts on the Three-Anti struggle during this period, some regions will inevitably be temporarily affected in the normal progress of grain management work. Individual regions have experienced situations where warehouses are left unattended, and grain is heating up, becoming infested with insects, and molding. Now is the thawing season in the north and the rainy season is approaching in the south, which is the season when grain is most susceptible to heating, insect infestation, and mold. Leading organs at all levels and all grain workers must pay attention to this early and take necessary measures to carry out prevention and control work. The following points are hereby proposed for study and implementation by all localities:

	I. It is required that finance departments at all levels closely monitor the grain storage work during the Three-Anti struggle. Major administrative regions, provinces, prefectures, and counties should organize forces to send out small inspection teams for routine inspections. In the near future, they should conduct a comprehensive inspection of all their grain depots, and if phenomena such as heating and insect infestation are found, they should immediately instruct on how to deal with it.

	II. Grain management departments must devote sufficient resources to carry out storage guidance work. In addition to ensuring the complete victory of the Three-Anti struggle, they must also ensure that grain is not damaged, so that the Three-Anti movement and business work do not affect each other.

	III. Grain depots in all localities must dedicate a certain amount of manpower and time to regularly inspect the grain they store, once every three or five days. Special attention should be paid to the bottom and corners of the warehouse during the inspection. If it is found that the grain has a lot of impurities and poor quality, and the moisture content is above 14 percent after inspection, it should be immediately turned over and dried in the wind and the stacks should be reversed, and plans should be made to use it as soon as possible. For other grain of better quality with a moisture content below 13 or 14 percent, attention should be paid to using natural wind for ventilation frequently, and blind turning and drying should be avoided, wasting manpower and financial resources.

	IV. Although localities carried out some warehouse cleaning and disinfection work during the grain collection and storage last year, they must not be careless because the breeding rate of warehouse insects is very high. Warehouses where warehouse insects have not been found should pay attention to prevention; warehouses where warehouse insects have been found should carry out emergency treatment. Existing medicines and equipment should be used reasonably to ensure the extermination of warehouse insects and insect eggs.

	V. Last year, some new warehouses were built in various localities; however, due to the collusion between some illegal merchants and a few internal bad elements, the work was cut down and the materials were reduced, resulting in many warehouses leaking rain, being skewed, and having cracks. This must not be neglected. A comprehensive inspection should be carried out on the old warehouses and the borrowed civilian warehouses; before the rainy season arrives, universal and appropriate repairs should be carried out, the warehouse foundation should be strengthened, and the water channels should be dredged to avoid unexpected losses.

Grain is an important material of the country and has a significant impact on the economy, prices, military needs, and people's food. Doing a good job in storage is a great contribution to the country and the people. It is hoped that leading organs at all levels will pay sufficient attention and strive to achieve greater achievements in grain storage this year.

    政务院财政经济委员会
    关于及时加强公粮保管以防霉坏的指示
    去年秋征，在抗美援朝伟大的群众爱国主义运动推动之下，各地及时地完成了征粮任务，粮食质量也比过去好的多了，这是很大的成绩。但大量粮食入库之后，由于我们底保管条件仍然较差，仓房不足，以及保管知识不够，保管设备与药械的不足等等，粮食霉坏的现象仍经常发现。现在全国绝大部分专级以上的政府机构，都已经或正在进行三反运动，粮食部门的贪污浪费和官僚主义现象必须在这个运动中彻底加以肃清。这样将使我们国家公粮的保管上损失减少，对工作的提高大有好处。但正因为这一期间集中力量进行三反斗争，有些地区就必然要暂时地影响到粮食管理工作的正常进行。个别地区已发生仓库无人管理，粮食发热、生虫和霉坏的现象。现北方正是化冻期间，南方雨水将多，这正是粮食最易发热、生虫、霉坏的季节，各级领导机关和全体粮食工作同志，必须及早注意，采取必要措施，进行防治工作。兹提出下列几点，希各地研究执行：
    一、要求各级财政部和财政部门在三反斗争中，要密切注意检查粮食保管工作。各大行政区、省、专、县应组织力量，派出小型的检查组，巡回检查，在最近期内，把所属粮库普遍检查一遍，遇有发热生虫的现象，要立即指示处理。
    二、粮食管理部门，必须拿出足够力量，进行保管指导工作，除应保证三反斗争彻底胜利外，并须保证粮食不受损坏，务使三反运动与业务工作，两不影响。
    三、各地粮食仓库，对自己保管的粮食，必须拿出一定力量，一定时间，经常进行检查，三日或五日一次，检查时要特别注意仓底和仓角。如发现粮食杂质多，品质差，经过检验水分在百分之十四以上者，应立即翻晒过风，倒垛，并计划尽早使用。其他质量较好，水分在百分之十三或十四以下者，则应切实注意利用自然风经常通风，要避免盲目翻晒，浪费人力财力。
    四、去年征收入库时，各地虽已做了一些清仓消毒工作，但因仓虫繁殖率很大，切不能麻痹大意。未发现仓虫的仓库，要注意预防；已发现仓虫的仓库，要进行紧急除治，现有药械应合理使用，务期灭绝仓虫和虫卵。
    五、去年各地建筑了若干新仓；但由于某些不法商人，与内部少数不良分子的相互勾结，偷工减料，致不少的仓库发生了漏雨、歪斜和裂缝等现象，对此绝不能疏忽大意，应连同旧仓和借用的民仓，普遍进行一次检查；在雨季未到之前，应普遍地适当地进行修补，加强仓基培固，疏通水路，以免意外损失。
    粮食是国家底重要物资，对经济、物价、军需、民食，都有重大的作用，做好保管工作，就是对国家对人民的极大的贡献。希各级领导机关应有足够的注意，争取在今年粮食保管上，获得更大的成绩。
