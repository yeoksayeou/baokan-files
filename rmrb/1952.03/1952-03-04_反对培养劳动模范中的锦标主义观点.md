    Opposing the Championship-ism Viewpoint in Cultivating Model Workers

    Most factories, mines, and their leading organs, in order to increase production, improve business management, and promote the common progress of the broad masses of workers, have therefore strived to cultivate many model workers. They value the achievements of model workers in production. They make the greatest effort to summarize and promote the advanced experiences of model workers.

    However, there are also quite a few leading cadres in factories and mines who cultivate model workers for the sake of cultivating model workers, who cultivate them to maintain the individual glory of model workers (in essence, for the “glory” of their own units and leading cadres). Some units, in order to attend a certain meeting, have workers make a "new record" in a concentrated effort, “cultivating” a model worker in order to show off the unit's "achievements" at the meeting. There are also some leading cadres who, although they have seen workers create advanced experiences, are not "interested" in summarizing the experiences of model workers because they feel that the model workers in their units are not as outstanding as the model workers in other units. These are all cultivating model workers from an individualistic, championship-ism viewpoint. The result of such "cultivation" is that even if a few model workers appear in one's own unit, production problems may not necessarily be solved. The purpose of the leading cadres of these enterprises is only to cultivate a few model workers in their units who are enough to boast to others; they are not very interested in the advanced experience of model workers. Some model workers in some enterprises do not have any advanced experience; their glorious title comes from the fact that the leading cadres of the enterprise want them to simply increase the intensity of their labor.

    The leading cadres of these enterprises should realize that the main indicator of whether or not there are achievements in the leadership work of an enterprise lies in whether or not production has been increased and business management has been improved by relying on the creative labor and rationalization proposals of the workers, and not anything else. Those enterprise units that have "cultivated" a few model workers but have not done a good job in production and business management should receive severe criticism, not glory.

### 反对培养劳动模范中的锦标主义观点

    反对培养劳动模范中的锦标主义观点
    大多数的工矿企业及其领导机关，为了提高生产、改进经营管理和推动广大职工共同前进，因而努力培养了许多劳动模范。他们重视劳动模范在生产上的成就。他们以最大的努力去总结并推广劳动模范的先进经验。
    但是，也还有不少的工矿企业的领导干部，是为培养劳动模范而培养劳动模范的，是为保持劳动模范的个人光荣（实质上是为了本单位和领导干部自己的“光荣”）而去培养他们的。有的单位为了要出席某一个会议而让工人去突击一个“新纪录”，“培养”出来一个劳动模范，以便在会议上炫耀本单位的“成绩”。也有一些单位的领导干部，虽然已经看到工人们创造出了先进的经验，但是，因为他们觉得本单位的劳动模范没有别的单位的劳动模范那么出色，于是就没有“兴致”去总结劳动模范的经验。这些都是以个人主义、锦标主义的观点去“培养”劳动模范的。这样“培养”的结果，纵然自己的单位也出现了几个劳动模范，但是生产中的问题并不一定能够解决。这些企业的领导干部的目的只是在本单位培养几个足以夸耀于人前的劳动模范，他们对于劳动模范的先进经验却是兴趣不大的。有的企业中的劳动模范并没有什么先进经验，他们的光荣称号是企业领导干部要他们单纯地加强劳动强度而得来的。
    这些企业的领导干部应该认识，对企业领导工作有没有成绩，主要的标志在于是不是依靠工人群众的创造性劳动和合理化建议而提高了生产，改进了经营管理，而不是其他。那些虽然“培养”了几个劳动模范，但是生产和经营管理都没有搞好的企业单位，所得到的只应该是严厉的批评，而不是光荣。
