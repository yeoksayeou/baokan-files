    Beware of Unscrupulous Merchants Profiteering from Engineering Materials

    Editor: After reading the article "Exposing the Inside Story of Corruption and Malpractice in Civil Engineering Construction" published in the People's Daily on March 2, I have a supplementary piece of information.

    In some large-scale (contracting labor and materials) projects, unscrupulous merchants and corrupt elements often steal state property through methods such as fraudulent purchases and obtaining materials through improper channels, particularly regarding essential engineering materials. There is a significant difference between the market price and the official price of certain key materials. For example, the market price of cement is 140,000 yuan per bag, while the official price is 35,000 yuan per bag; the market price of timber is 8,000,000 yuan per cubic meter, while the official price is 3,500,000 yuan per cubic meter. Unscrupulous merchants exploit this gap by bribing corrupt elements to purchase materials at official prices in the name of the public, and then use market prices for the project budget, deceiving the clients. The enormous profits gained by the unscrupulous merchants through this practice are staggering. A single document authorizing a purchase through improper channels can cause significant losses to the state. I suggest that administrative cadres in relevant departments pay close attention to this conspiracy by unscrupulous merchants.

    警惕奸商套购工程材料
    编辑同志：看了三月二日人民日报刊载的“揭发土木建筑工程中贪污舞弊的内幕”一文，我有一点补充材料。
    在一些大包（包工、包料）工程中，奸商和贪污分子时常在主要的工程材料方面，用冒购和套购的方式，盗窃国家财富。有一些主要材料的市价和牌价差别很大，比如：洋灰市价每袋十四万元，牌价每袋三万五千元；木材市价每立方公尺八百万元，牌价每立方公尺三百五十万元。奸商利用这个空隙，买通贪污分子，用公家名义请购牌价材料，再按市价作工程预算，欺骗委托者。奸商转手之间，所获得的暴利是惊人的。一纸套购的公文就可以使国家受到很大的损失。我建议有关部门的行政干部，密切注意奸商这个阴谋。　　　清华大学　王荫国
