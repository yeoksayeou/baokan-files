　　(I) Germ Warfare Can Never Save the US Aggressors from Utter Defeat

　　A dispatch from Tokyo by Reuters on February 29th said: "The chief representative of the United Nations Command at the Korean armistice talks, Joye, stated here today that the United Nations Command has lost its military advantage and is now negotiating from a position of stalemate." Even Joye, this arrogant American aggressor, now admits with disappointment that the US military has lost its military advantage. This shows the desperate position the US aggressors have fallen into on the Korean battlefield!

　　The US aggressors have always considered themselves to have a "military advantage." They wanted to swallow Korea in one gulp and then attack China. However, since October of the year before last, under the heavy blows of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, they suffered repeated defeats, and by the beginning of July last year, they had lost more than 200,000 men. Their plan of aggression went bankrupt, and they were forced to agree to hold armistice talks with our side. At that time, the American aggressor chiefs were still not convinced. While delaying and blackmailing in the negotiations, trying to seize from the negotiating table the land they were unable to seize on the battlefield, they were still clamoring to exert "military pressure." They launched a "summer offensive" and then an "autumn offensive." But these two offensives were still completely defeated by our army. From the start of the armistice talks on July 10th last year to the end of November, the US aggressors lost more than 200,000 more men, and only then did they have to reach the second agreement on the Korean armistice talks with our representatives in late November. At that time, the American aggressor soldiers, who were scared out of their wits and eager to go home, had once automatically ceased fire. Although the American generals quickly issued orders to the soldiers to continue to die for them, and continued to clamor about exerting "military pressure," and quickly transferred the US 40th and 45th Infantry Divisions from Japan to Korea to fight; however, they were even more powerless, and they were no longer able to launch a large-scale offensive. However, even in the sporadic battles in December last year and January this year, the US aggressors lost more than 20,000 men. In February this year, in just one battle on Hill 662.0 east of the Bukhan River and its vicinity, a unit of our army annihilated nearly 1,000 enemy soldiers in seven days. In the past year or so, the United States and its puppet and subordinate countries have lost a total of more than 500,000 troops, of which more than 220,000 were American troops.

　　The US aggressors also suffered heavy losses in the air force. The US aggressors have always relied on airplanes to embolden themselves. However, since our army strengthened its anti-aircraft fire and the People's Air Force participated in the battle, the losses of American aircraft have greatly increased. In the fifteen months from October 25, 1950, to the end of January this year, the United States lost a total of 3,468 aircraft in Korea. In the first eight months, the average monthly loss of American aircraft was more than 100; recently, it has increased to more than 300 per month. The US aggressors themselves admitted that January this year was the month with the most aircraft losses since the start of the war. Since July and August last year, the American invading air force, which suffered heavy losses, has greatly reduced its strength to bomb our rear. They can only concentrate their remaining forces to bomb some important sections of our railway lines. They call this key bombing the "strangulation war," dreaming of cutting off our transportation line by this method. However, despite the heavy price paid by the US Air Force every month, our transportation capacity is getting stronger and stronger, and the materials transported to the front are constantly increasing. Even Baldwin, the military reporter of the New York Times, said: "The 'strangulation war' in which the Air Force attempts to isolate the Korean ground battlefield by cutting off the enemy's transportation lines has apparently failed to achieve the purpose of suffocation so far. Van Fleet, who advocates using most of our air force for the 'strangulation war,' is very worried about the limited number of allied aircraft. He has been under great pressure from his ground commanders, who demanded increased air support." Because the American air force pilots suffered heavy casualties, they complained that the American aircraft were not well designed. This argument has been argued in the US Congress.

　　Now, in order to save their military defeat, the US aggressors are trying to prolong and expand the war of aggression. On the one hand, they continue to delay the Korean armistice talks, and on the other hand, they disregard human justice and international conventions and use germ warfare on a large scale. From January 28th, US aircraft have continuously spread a large number of germs in our army's positions and rear in Korea, and used germ shells on the front line. From February 29th to March 5th, US aggressor aircraft even continuously invaded our Northeast, spreading a large number of poisonous insects and germs in Andong, Fushun, Fengcheng, Kuandian, Ji'an, Xinmin and other places, and bombing and strafing in the Linjiang and Changdianhekou areas. The crazy and reckless behavior of the US aggressors is a desperate struggle like a dog jumping over a wall. People will not forget that the Japanese imperialists used germ warfare when their war of aggression against China failed; but the result was a complete failure. The US aggressors also spread a large number of smallpox germs when they retreated in northern Korea in December of the year before last and January last year, but they were still beaten and fled south of the "38th" parallel. Now, they are using germ warfare again, and they will certainly not be able to save their defeat.

### （一）细菌武器绝不能挽救美国侵略军的惨败

专栏：宣传员的讲话

    （一）细菌武器绝不能挽救美国侵略军的惨败
    二月二十九日，英国路透社在东京发出的电报里说：“朝鲜停战谈判联军首席代表乔埃今天在此间发表的一项声明中说：联军已经丧失了军事优势，目前不得不在一种对峙的地位上来进行谈判。”乔埃这个一向趾高气扬的美国侵略者，现在也灰心丧气地承认美军丧失了军事优势。这说明美国侵略军在朝鲜战场上已经陷入了怎样狼狈的地位！
    美国侵略者一向是自认为有“军事优势”的。他们想一口气吞并了朝鲜，再进攻中国。可是，自从前年十月以后，他们在中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的沉重打击下，连吃败仗，到去年七月初就损失了二十几万人。侵略计划破产了，这才被迫同意和我方举行停战谈判。那时，美国的侵略头子们还不服气。他们一面在谈判中拖延、讹诈，想从会议桌上夺取他们在战场上无力夺取的土地；一面仍在叫嚣着施用“军事压力”。来了一个“夏季攻势”，又来一个“秋季攻势”。可是这两个攻势，仍然被我军彻底打败了。从去年七月十日停战谈判开始到十一月底止，美国侵略军又损失了二十几万人，这才不得不和我方代表在十一月下旬达成朝鲜停战谈判的第二项协议。当时，被我军打得丧魂失魄、渴望着回家的美国侵略军士兵，曾经一度自动停火。美国的将军们虽然赶紧下命令叫士兵继续为他们送死，继续喧嚷着施用“军事压力”，又赶紧从日本把美军第四十、第四十五步兵师调到朝鲜来作战；但是，他们已经更加力不从心了，他们再也没有能够发动大规模的进攻。可是，就在去年十二月和今年一月的零星战斗中，美国侵略军方面也损失了两万多人。今年二月，仅在北汉江以东六六二点零高地及其附近的一次战斗中，我军某部在七天中又歼灭了敌军近一千人。一年多来，美国及其傀儡和仆从国家方面总共损失了五十多万军队，其中美军占了二十二万多人。
    美国侵略者在空军方面的损失也很大。美国侵略军一向是靠飞机来壮胆的。但自从我军加强了对空射击和人民空军参加作战以后，美国飞机的损失大大增加。从一九五○年十月二十五日到今年一月底止的十五个多月内，美国在朝鲜总共损失了飞机三千四百六十八架。最初八个月美国飞机每月平均损失一百多架；最近则增加到每月损失三百多架。美国侵略者自己也承认，今年一月是开战以来损失飞机最多的一个月。从去年七、八月开始，损失惨重的美国侵朝空军，到我军后方来轰炸的力量已经大大减弱了。他们只能集中残余的力量，轰炸我方铁路线上的某些重要地段。他们把这种重点轰炸叫做什么“窒死战”，梦想用这种方法截断我方的运输线。可是，尽管美国空军每月付出重大代价，而我方的运输力却愈来愈强，运到前线的物资也不断增多。连纽约时报的军事记者鲍尔温也说：“空军企图用切断敌方交通线的办法以孤立朝鲜地面战场的‘窒死战’，到目前为止，显然没有完成窒息的目的。赞成把我们大部分空军力量用于‘窒死战’的范佛里特，很为联军飞机为数有限一事耽心。他曾受到他的地面司令官们极大的压力，他们要求增加空军的支援。”美国的空军驾驶员因为死伤惨重，就埋怨美国的飞机设计得不好。这个争吵一直吵到了美国的国会里去了。
    现在，美国侵略者为了挽救他们的军事惨败，正企图延长和扩大侵略战争。一方面继续拖延朝鲜停战谈判，一方面竟不顾人类正义和国际公约，大量地使用细菌武器。从一月二十八日起，美国飞机在朝鲜我军阵地和后方，连续不断地大量撒布细菌，并且在前线上使用细菌炮弹。从二月二十九日到三月五日，美国侵略军飞机竟连续侵入我国东北，在安东、抚顺、凤城、宽甸、辑安、新民等地撒下大批毒虫和细菌，并且在临江、长甸河口地区轰炸扫射。美国侵略军这样发疯一样的胡作非为，正是一种狗急跳墙的垂死挣扎。人们都不会忘记：日本帝国主义在侵略中国战争失利时曾经使用过细菌武器；但结果是彻底失败了。美国侵略军前年十二月和去年一月在朝鲜北部败退时也撒布过大量天花细菌，结果还是被打得逃到“三八”线以南去了。现在，他们又使用细菌武器，同样决不能挽救他们失败的局面。
