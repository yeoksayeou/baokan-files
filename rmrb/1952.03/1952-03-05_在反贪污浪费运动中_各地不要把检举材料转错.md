    In the Anti-Corruption and Anti-Waste Campaign
    All Regions Must Not Misdirect Accusation Materials
    Comrade Editor: Since the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement nationwide, various regions have provided many accusation materials to each other, which is a very good phenomenon. However, recently it has been discovered that many departments are not serious and responsible enough when forwarding materials, often sending the materials to the wrong place, resulting in long round trips, making the materials lose their timeliness and reducing their due role. From a confidentiality perspective, it is also not good. For example, the Hebei Provincial Thrift Inspection Committee, because it wrote the envelope incorrectly, sent the materials that should have been sent to the Chahar Provincial Thrift Inspection Committee to the Harbin Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee. Similar situations often occur in the forwarding of materials in other counties and cities. When materials are forwarded between various agencies in Harbin, mistakes often occur because the person approving the documents is not careful. These situations should be prevented. I am specifically raising this in the hope that it will attract the attention of relevant departments in various regions.

### 在反贪污浪费运动中  各地不要把检举材料转错

    在反贪污浪费运动中
    各地不要把检举材料转错
    编辑同志：反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动在全国范围内开展以后，各地互相提供了许多检举材料，这是很好的现象。但近来发现许多部门转寄材料时，不够严肃和负责，往往把材料寄错了，以致往返很远路程，使材料失去时间性，减低了它应有的作用。从保密上说也是不好的。例如，河北省节约检查委员会因为把信皮写错，而把应该寄给察哈尔省节约检查委员会的材料，寄到哈尔滨市节约检查委员会来了。其他县、市在转寄材料方面，也常发生类似情形。哈尔滨市各机关间转送材料时，也往往由于批件人不注意，发生转错了的事情，这些情况都是应该防止的。特此提出，希能引起各地有关部门注意。
