Instructions from Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central South Military and Political Committee, on the Anti-Theft Campaign in Wuhan

At the 73rd administrative meeting of the Central South Military and Political Committee on February 23, Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central South Military and Political Committee, gave important instructions on the campaign against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and theft of state economic intelligence in Wuhan. The full text is as follows:

Vice Mayor Wang Renzhong's report on Wuhan's campaign against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence fully proves the seriousness of the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on the revolution over the past three years. In Wuhan alone, 109 commercial firms stole more than 130 billion yuan of state assets, of which 27 households used 1.4 billion yuan to entice more than 430 cadres, and 22 became internal spies. Some of our departments, such as the Foreign Trade Administration, the Central South District Company of the China Industrial Equipment Company, and the Bank of China, can be said to have been usurped by them and become their service offices. Isn't this enough to illustrate the seriousness of the attack? Illegal capitalists have spread the fallacy that they have no army or guns, so how can they attack the revolution? In fact, this kind of sugar-coated cannonball, this method of "sending in and pulling over," is much more powerful than open gun attacks. Facts have proved that many of our cadres did not succumb in the face of armed enemies, but in the short three years after the victory of the revolution, they were attacked by this sugar-coated cannonball and collapsed. Some have become prisoners, acting as agents for illegal capitalists in state-owned enterprises and government agencies. This internal attack has cooperated with the external enemy's armed attack. For example,奸商 Li Yinting, Zhou Zexin, Liu Ziqing, and Yan Guitang manufactured unsanitized emergency kits, unusable telephone wires, and iron picks and sent them to the Korean front to endanger the People's Volunteer Army's operations, which is a clear example. In order to make profits, illegal capitalists can use fake goods as good goods, bad goods as good goods, sell at low prices as high prices, and high prices as low prices. In order to make profits, they can weigh heavily when buying and lightly when selling, and they can cut corners. Especially those unscrupulous merchants who covet huge profits, they want to make a fortune, and they know that they cannot do without the help of state workers, so they do not hesitate to use all despicable and dirty means of bribery and threats, from entertaining, giving gifts, bribing to 美人计, offering dry shares, step by step pulling state workers over, and sending them in from the outside, stealing intelligence, falsely reporting business information, obtaining foreign exchange, smuggling and evading taxes, buying empty and selling empty, defrauding loans, and even further controlling some of our state-owned enterprises and state agencies to serve them. Of course, as far as some members of the bourgeoisie are concerned, there are also good people, progressives, democrats, and upright people. But there are indeed many illegal merchants. Taking Wuhan as an example, at the beginning of liberation, they were influenced by the Kuomintang's reactionary propaganda and felt that the Communists were "scary." Later, we adhered to the correct policies in practice and provided them with various assistance and conveniences, and they felt that the Communists were "amiable." But over time, they saw that we had bureaucracy and weaknesses to exploit, and they felt that the Communists were "deceivable." This is the three-part曲 of the attitude of illegal capitalists in Wuhan towards us. They are not satisfied with the protection and help given to them by the Communist Party and the People's Government and the automatic concessions made by the working class during the economic difficulties of the previous year. On the contrary, they repay kindness with ingratitude. The more frequent and closer their relationship with government agencies and state-owned enterprises, the more fierce the attack and the greater the harm. As for the hedonistic, selfish, greedy, wasteful, corrupt, and degenerate behavior of the illegal bourgeoisie, the ideological attack and erosion on the Communist Party members and the working class is even more like mercury pouring onto the ground, penetrating everywhere. Many of our cadres have always lived a hard and simple life, but after entering the city, they tend to become corrupt and degenerate. The main reason is that they have been influenced and eroded by the illegal bourgeoisie in their ideology. This requires us to greatly raise our vigilance, clearly recognize the ugly nature of the illegal bourgeoisie and the seriousness of their attack on the revolution, clearly draw class lines ideologically, and resolutely repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attack. Not only government personnel and the working class should do this, but also industrialists and businessmen should educate themselves, abandon the idea of exorbitant profits, change despicable behavior, and not engage in speculation and fraud. They should be honest, improve their management methods, achieve genuine goods at fair prices, and establish a good reputation. Only in this way can they achieve a bright future for industrialists and businessmen in the process of socialist construction. All ideas of making a fortune and illegal behaviors will not only not work, but will eventually be punished by the people.

How can we repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attack? First of all, we must overcome the serious right-leaning thoughts among cadres and workers, overcome the erroneous views of not hating奸商, not hating corruption, even protecting illegal merchants, pitying corrupt elements, and underestimating the seriousness of the situation. Internally, we must complete the anti-corruption campaign and eliminate all economic spies. Externally, we must launch an anti-theft campaign to thoroughly expose illegal industrialists and businessmen. We should resolutely adopt a policy of punishment against those who have committed heinous crimes and are stubborn and refuse to confess. Otherwise, it will not be enough to quell public anger, nor will it be enough to warn奸商. Those who have violated the law but can thoroughly confess can be treated leniently.

Secondly, we must correctly grasp the policy of uniting the majority and punishing the minority. Our slogan is to repel the bourgeoisie's attack and punish illegal merchants, not to overthrow the bourgeoisie. Throughout the entire New Democratic stage, we still allow the existence and development of the bourgeoisie. We must strictly ban the illegal activities of industrialists and businessmen, but we resolutely protect the legitimate operations of industrialists and businessmen. We must punish奸商 who have committed heinous crimes, but we also effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of legitimate industrialists and businessmen. We must oppose the bourgeoisie's idea of exorbitant profits, but we also guarantee the legitimate profits of the bourgeoisie in our price policy. We will severely punish cunning merchants who stubbornly sabotage, but we will treat all those who thoroughly confess leniently. Those whose illegal behavior is not serious and who can confess thoroughly will not only not be punished, but can also be given appropriate reductions or exemptions from refunds. Those who abide by the law will be given normal treatment and encouraged to actively operate. The Anti-Corruption Joint Inspection Committee should formulate its action plan based on this policy. Therefore, only a very small number of people will be arrested and fined, and even fewer will be given severe penalties and confiscation of property. A large proportion should be those who repent and return money without being punished. And those in industry and commerce who have no illegal behavior or whose illegal behavior is not serious will not be punished or refunded. This part of the people may account for more than half of the total number of industrial and commercial households. In total, those who abide by the law and those who do not fully abide by the law but whose mistakes are not serious account for more than 90% of the total number of industrial and commercial households. At present, the Joint Inspection Committee should first investigate the situation of these people, announce their exemption from punishment through self-reporting, public discussion, trade union discussion and review, and government approval procedures, and encourage them to actively report奸商 in order to strengthen the lineup of the campaign against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence.

Thirdly, we must fully mobilize shop employees and workers, and we must pay attention to mobilizing and uniting senior shop employees. Only by fully mobilizing them can illegal capitalists not be able to play tricks on their resistance movement. To this end, we must educate this part of senior shop employees in the movement, pointing out that they are part of the working class, and that they only have a future by relying on the People's Government and the working class. As long as they become aware and firmly stand on the side of the working class and the People's Government to fight against illegal industrialists and businessmen, the People's Government will definitely guarantee that they will not lose their jobs, and some of them will become excellent backbones of public enterprises in the future. Some shop employees, especially senior shop employees, have also been enticed by bosses to do dishonest things. This should be treated as an internal matter of the workers, and the trade union should help them confess, and they will be exempt from investigation.

In short, we must use the anti-corruption movement and the anti-theft movement to educate ourselves and the bourgeoisie, so that the social atmosphere will be changed. This is our goal. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中南军政委员会副主席邓子恢
    对武汉市反盗窃运动的指示
    中南军政委员会副主席邓子恢在二月二十三日举行的中南军政委员会七十三次行政会议上对武汉市反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动作了重要指示。全文如下：
    王任重副市长关于武汉市反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动的报告，完全证明了违法资产阶级三年来向革命猖狂进攻的严重性：在武汉仅仅一百零九家商行便盗窃了国家资财达一千三百多亿元，其中二十七户，用十四亿款子勾引了四百三十多个干部，有二十二个成了内奸；我们某些部门，如对外贸易管理局、中国工业器材公司中南区公司、中国银行等，可以说已被他们篡夺，成了为他们服务的办事处；这还不够说明进攻的严重性吗？违法资本家曾发出谬论，说他们一无军队，二无枪炮，怎能向革命进攻？实际上这种糖衣包着的炮弹，这种“派进来、拉过去”的办法，比之公开枪炮的进攻还要厉害得多。事实已经证明我们有不少干部在武装敌人的面前没有屈服过，但在革命胜利以后，短短的三年中却受了这种糖衣炮弹的袭击而躺下去了；有些已成了俘虏，成为违法资本家在国营企业与政权机关内的代理人。这种内部袭击并已与外部敌人武装进攻起了配合作用，如：奸商李寅廷、周泽信、刘子清、严贵堂等制造未经消毒的救急包，不能用的电话线和铁镐，送到朝鲜前线去危害人民志愿军作战，就是明显的例子。违法资本家为了图利，他们可以用假货冒好货，以坏货当好货，低价卖高价，高价当低价；为了图利，他们可以大秤入、小秤出，可以偷工减料。特别是那些贪图暴利的奸商，他们想要大发横财，知道非有国家工作人员的帮助不行，他们便不惜使用一切卑鄙龌龊、利诱威胁的手段，由请客、送礼、行贿直到美人计、许干股，一步一步把国家工作人员拉过去，又从外边派进来，盗窃情报，虚报商情，套取外汇，走私漏税，买空卖空，诈骗贷款，以至进一步控制我们某些国营企业与国家机关为他们服务。当然，就资产阶级某些人来说，也有好的，有进步分子，有民主人士，也有正派人物；但是违法商人确实不少。即以武汉为例，在解放初期，他们受了国民党反动宣传，觉得共产党人“可怕”；后来我们在实际上坚持正确政策，并给他们多方帮助与各种便利，他们觉得共产党人“可亲”；但久而久之，他们看出我们有官僚主义、有弱点可乘，就觉得共产党人“可欺”了。这就是武汉违法资本家对我们态度的三部曲。他们并不因为共产党人、人民政府对他们的保护、帮助与工人阶级在前年经济困难时期的自动让步而感到满足，相反地却是恩将仇报，愈与政府机关及国营企业来往频繁、关系密切者，进攻就愈凶，危害就愈大。至于违法资产阶级享乐至上、损人利己、贪污浪费、腐化堕落行为，对共产党员与工人阶级在思想上所起的进攻腐蚀作用，则更如水银泻地，无孔不入。我们有许多干部生活一贯艰苦朴素，而进入城市后即趋腐化堕落，其主要原因就是在思想上受了违法资产阶级影响侵蚀的结果。这就需要我们大大提高警惕，清楚认识违法资产阶级的丑恶本质及其对革命进攻的严重性，在思想上明确划清阶级界限，坚决打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻。不仅政府人员与工人阶级应该如此，即工商业者也应以此教育自己，放弃暴利思想，改变卑鄙行为，不要投机取巧，不要欺诈盗骗，而应老老实实，改善经营方法，做到货真价实，信用昭著，在扩大正当营业中取得正当利润，只有这样做才是新民主主义建设过程中工商业者的光明出路，一切横财思想和违法行为，不仅行不通，且最后一定要受到人民的制裁。
    如何才能打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻？首先，必须克服干部与职工群众中严重存在的右倾思想，克服对奸商不恨，对贪污不恨，甚至袒护违法商人，可怜贪污分子，及对情况严重估计不足的错误观点；在内部必须完成反贪污运动，肃清一切经济内奸；在外部必须开展反盗窃运动，彻底揭发违法工商业者。对那些罪大恶极而又顽抗不坦白分子，应坚决采取惩办政策，不这样不足以平众愤，也不足以警戒奸商。对那些虽然违法而能彻底坦白者，则可以从宽处理。
    其次，必须正确掌握团结多数、惩办少数的政策。我们的口号是打退资产阶级进攻，惩办违法商人，而不是打倒资产阶级。在整个新民主主义阶段内我们仍然允许资产阶级的存在与发展。我们要严格取缔工商业者的违法行为，但我们又坚决保护工商业者的正当经营；我们要处罚罪大恶极的奸商，但我们又切实保护正当工商业者的合法权益；我们要反对资产阶级的暴利思想，但我们又在物价政策上保证资产阶级的正当利润。我们对顽抗破坏的狡猾商人决加惩处，但对彻底坦白分子则一律从宽处理，其违法行为不大，而又能坦白者不仅不加处罚，且可酌情减免退款；对守法的工商业者则予以正常待遇，鼓励其积极经营。反贪污联合检查委员会应根据这种政策来规定自己的行动计划。因此要逮捕罚款的只是很少数人，其中要处以重刑没收财产的更是极少数；只悔过退款而不处罚者应占很大一部分；而工商业中无违法行为或违法不大者，则既不处罚，又不退款，这部分人可能占工商业总户数一半以上。合计守法与不完全守法但又错误不大的约占工商业总户数百分之九十以上。目前联合检查委员会就应先将这些人查明情况，通过自报公议、工会讨论审查、政府批准手续宣布免处，并鼓励他们积极检举奸商，以增强反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动的阵容。
    再次，必须充分发动店员工人，并须注意发动和团结高级店员。只有将他们充分发动起来，违法资本家才无法玩弄其抵抗运动的阴谋伎俩。为此，必须在运动中教育这一部分高级店员，指明他们是工人阶级的一部分，他们只有依靠人民政府和工人阶级才有前途，只要他们觉悟起来，坚决站在工人阶级与人民政府方面，向违法工商业者作斗争，人民政府一定保证他们不会失业，将来他们中间一部分人还会成为公营企业的优秀骨干。店员特别是高级店员中也有些人被老板引诱手头不干净者，应作为工人内部的事情，由工会帮助他们坦白，一律免予追究。
    总之，我们必须用反贪污运动和反盗窃运动教育自己，也教育资产阶级，使社会风气为之一变，这就是我们的目的。  （新华社）
