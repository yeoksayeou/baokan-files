    Merchants Should Write Clearly When Issuing Invoices

    To the Editor: During the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns, we discovered that many shipping documents have blurry or excessively scribbled handwriting, making them difficult to understand and causing difficulties in accounting. Some documents are missing words, and some do not include the date. This not only increases the difficulty of reviewing documents but also provides opportunities for corrupt elements to falsely report and alter documents.

    There is also inconsistency in the way numbers are written, especially on documents from small shops and vendors, which are even more complex. Some use "Arabic" numerals, while others use uppercase numerals. These two types of numerals are relatively difficult to alter. However, some still use extremely unscientific old numerals, which are the easiest to alter. For example, the character "丨" can be turned into "刂" with one stroke, and the character "丄" can be turned into "?" with two strokes. These alterations are very difficult to detect, allowing corrupt elements to exploit loopholes. To prevent corruption, we hope that all companies, merchants, and vendors will clearly write the product name, quantity, unit price, subtotal, total, and date (year, month, and day) on their shipping documents.

    商号开发票要把字写清楚
    编辑同志：我们在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，发现不少发货单据字迹模糊或太潦草，使人不容易看懂，对起账来很困难；也有的单据上写丢了字；更有的单据不写日期。这样不但使审查单据工作增加了困难，而且也给贪污分子造成了冒报、涂改单据的好机会。
    在数字的写法上也很不一致，特别是小商店及摊贩写的单据更为复杂，有的用“阿拉伯”字码，有的用大写的字码，这两种字码是比较难涂改的。但仍有用极不科学的老字码的，这种字码最容易涂改，如：“丨”字填上一笔就成“刂”字，“丄”字填上两笔就成了“?”字，并且在涂改后很不容易看出来，使贪污分子钻了空子。为了杜绝贪污，希望各公司、商号、摊贩在发货单据上，一定要把品名、数量、单价、合计、总计及年月日等写清楚。    龙麟
