One of the fundamental conditions for the victory of our revolution is that our Party possesses thousands upon thousands of revolutionary cadres who are infinitely loyal to the revolutionary cause. Among these revolutionary cadres, those who play a backbone role are the old cadres who have been tested in revolution for a long time and have accumulated rich experience in struggle in various revolutionary periods. Old cadres represent the fine traditions of our Party and the highest honor of communists. Comrade Stalin viewed old cadres in this way: "Of course, old cadres are a great asset to the Party and the state. They possess something that young cadres do not have, namely, rich experience in leadership, the tempering of Marxist-Leninist principles, profound knowledge of the world, and the ability to determine direction." (Summary Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at the 18th Party Congress) Everyone can learn examples and experience from old cadres. Applying this experience can avoid repeating past lessons.

Most of our old cadres are the kind of people Stalin referred to. They patiently train new cadres. The close unity of new and old cadres is the guarantee for us to overcome all difficulties and promote all work forward.

However, does this mean that all old cadres who have been tempered through long-term revolutionary struggle are as mature as Stalin said? It should be said that most are, or are close to being so, but there is also a small number who, because they are burdened with the heavy baggage of "old seniority," are increasingly lagging behind and even degenerating. This small number of people do not possess the basic conditions Stalin spoke of, such as "rich experience in leadership, the tempering of Marxist-Leninist principles, profound knowledge of the world, and the ability to determine direction." They merely consider themselves special figures with an "old brand name" inside and outside the Party, and have developed serious individualism, liberalism, and a lack of organization and discipline. After the victory of the revolution, these people could not withstand the corruption of the bourgeoisie and underwent changes of a degenerative nature. In the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, their erroneous behaviors were exposed by the masses inside and outside the Party, and they were subjected to Party discipline and legal sanctions. According to reports, the old Party members who have now been expelled from the Party or punished according to law include Liu Qingshan (former Deputy Secretary of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee) and Zhang Zishan (former Secretary of the Tianjin District Committee), both of whom have been sentenced to death, as well as Dai Jiying (former Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee in Kaifeng), Bu Shengguang (former Minister of Public Security of the Central South Military and Political Committee), Wang Shengrong (former Deputy Minister of Industry of the Central South Military and Political Committee), Yi Jiguang, Zhou Jifang (former Deputy Mayors of Wuhan), Deng Chi (former Manager of the Northeast Branch of the China Department Store), and Han Yongzan (former Director of the Shenyang Bureau of Industry and Commerce), etc. Although they are only a small number of people, this is enough to illustrate the seriousness of bourgeois corruption of the Party.

Party organizations should lead Party members in discussing these materials that have been published in the newspapers, recognizing the serious nature of the degeneration and deterioration of these people, and analyzing the fundamental reasons for their disgrace. Ideologically drawing a clear line between classes will help eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology within the Party.

Some comrades feel that these degenerates were once "old cadres" and therefore hold "sympathetic views" or "pitying views" towards them. This is a right-leaning ideology. These degenerates were indeed "old cadres" in the past, but today their old seniority has deteriorated and become corrupted. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists": "Revolutionaries who have been tempered through long years of revolutionary struggle do not necessarily become very good and experienced revolutionaries." Although these people did a lot of work in the past, they did not gradually improve their communist consciousness or strengthen their revolutionary self-cultivation and training in actual struggle, and therefore were burdened for a long time and could not move forward with great strides. For example, although Dai Jiying participated in the revolution for a long time, his selfish and individualistic qualities did not fundamentally change; Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan consistently suppressed and deceived their superiors, took credit for themselves, and acted arbitrarily; Wang Shengrong was also a backward element who repeatedly made serious mistakes and did not correct them. After these people climbed to responsible positions, they became arrogant and complacent, detached from the masses, high above, and forgot the arduous revolutionary struggle. They did not engage in strict organizational life, nor did they conduct criticism and self-criticism. Their ideological consciousness retained a strong individualistic and exploiting class consciousness. After the victory of the revolution, under the fierce attack of bourgeois ideology and the intensification of class struggle, their non-proletarian consciousness became even more prominent. They shamelessly believed that they had won the world and that it was now time to act arbitrarily. Since their proletarian revolutionary consciousness was very weak, they naturally could not withstand the test. As a result, they were defeated by bourgeois ideology and became prisoners of the bourgeoisie. For example, Deng Chi, manager of the Northeast District Department Store, once said: "I have been in the revolution for twenty years, risking my life, and finally I have what I have today." This is the most essential manifestation of bourgeois ideology, indicating the end of their revolutionary nature. Therefore, their revolutionary history has long been corrupted by bourgeois ideology. It is very necessary to recognize this essential change. Only in this way can we ideologically draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy and regard them as alien elements of the class, and will no longer hold any "sympathetic views" or "pitying views" towards them.

Some comrades believe that although these degenerates have serious problems, they have contributed to the Party in the past. Therefore, the idea of "offsetting crimes with merits" has arisen. However, communists should never attribute their merits to their personal accounts. Revolution is the struggle of the people's masses led by the Party. All victories should be attributed to the Party, to the working class and other working people. All work achievements are the creation of collective strength. What is there to take credit for when a communist does the work they should do for the Party and the revolution? Even if they have made certain contributions, the facts prove that it is still wrong to only see the "merits" side, because: Under the fierce attack of the bourgeoisie, their exploiting class ideology and style of work fundamentally contradict the interests of the Party. They are using their "merits" as "capital" to resist and undermine the great cause of the Party and the people. They say, "We old men won the world, and the young men enjoy the blessings," and also, "Others dare not cause trouble, but I dare," "Let's see what they can do to me." They arbitrarily act recklessly, cultivate personal power, implement patriarchal rule, suppress democracy, arbitrarily attack comrades who adhere to principles and struggle within the Party, frame good people, and oppress the masses of people. They have developed an exploiting class style that is no different from that of the Kuomintang reactionary rulers. Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan attacked Party member cadres and the broad masses who represented the correct principles of the Tianjin Party organization, in order to cover up their shameful betrayal. Zhou Jifang and Song Ying attacked Sun Mailing and other Party member cadres and Ji Kaifu and other progressive masses who resolutely fought against their erroneous behaviors. Dai Jiying attacked the Henan Provincial Committee everywhere, "elevating himself and attacking others. Anyone who struggles against his mistakes is considered to be attacking him, squeezing him out, and undermining him, and therefore he retaliates and attacks these people" (see the Decision of the CPC Henan Provincial Committee on Expelling Dai Jiying from the Party). During his tenure as Deputy Mayor of Wuhan, Yi Jiguang took in and reused a Kuomintang secret agent who had served as a puppet commissioner and a puppet county magistrate who had suppressed student movements, as well as bullies and puppet police criminal team deputies. He actually formed a counter-revolutionary group with these people. This is the inevitable result of the development of individualism and liberalism to the point where there is no distinction between the enemy and ourselves. Under the conditions of the bourgeois attack, this decadent individualism is bound to unite with bourgeois ideology and become the most convenient tool for the bourgeoisie to seize the revolutionary fortress from within. Indulging these people's mistakes is to help the rampant attack of the bourgeoisie, which will lead to the danger of national subjugation, party destruction, and personal ruin. This is the essence of the problem. Since their past "merits" cannot completely offset today's "crimes," therefore, the view that puts "merits" and "crimes" on an equal footing is a right-leaning erroneous ideology that blurs the viewpoint of class struggle.

Some people also believe that the degeneration of Deng Chi, Wang Shengrong, Bu Shengguang and others is mainly due to their loose lifestyle. This view is completely wrong. After these people entered the city, because they blindly pursued the decadent life of the bourgeoisie, the inevitable result was the development of capitalist ideas, and therefore changes in their qualities occurred. The bourgeoisie is precisely using this weakness to corrupt them, and then using their "powers" and their "old qualifications" as amulets to organize groups that steal state property, and further launch serious attacks on the state and the people. The Northeast Pharmaceutical Company led by Luo Rongchun completely became a private merchant speculation and profiteering institution. Just in terms of their speculation and tax evasion, they caused the state to lose 4.55 billion Northeast currency. Deng Chi of the Northeast District Department Store stole the state's iron and various machines, colluded with unscrupulous merchants to open factories, and also invested in private merchants in the name of his son. The degenerates regarded these "shares," "factories," and "stores" as their "escape route" for openly betraying the revolution and defecting to the bourgeoisie in the future. Wang Shengrong boasted everywhere that "the non-ferrous metal industry is a money-making tree," and that the Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau "looks at one or two hundred million yuan like rice grains falling from eating." These state-owned enterprises have become kingdoms of embezzlers and thieves, and of course they cannot but change the socialist nature of state-owned enterprises and become capitalist "money-making trees." The bourgeoisie's corruption in life has plunged them into the bottomless abyss of capitalism and made them unable to extricate themselves. As a result, the Party, the working class, and the people of the whole country have suffered serious harm and impact. Can this be said to be a matter of lifestyle? A communist should become a communist in all aspects, in all his activities and life, this is the teaching of the great Lenin. Bu Shengguang and others betrayed the principles of communism, so they had no choice but to degenerate into bourgeois elements.

The struggle within the Party is a reflection of class struggle. We can fully understand this from the painful lessons of the degeneration and deterioration of this small number of old cadres. Every comrade should deeply realize that if a communist does not establish the lofty ideal of communism and wholeheartedly strive for its realization to the end, bourgeois ideology can completely corrupt him, even ruin his glorious history of struggle, discredit him, and make him a member of the hostile class.

The basic condition for a communist to maintain his glorious history of struggle is to learn to master Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in actual work, constantly improve his Party spirit, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against all erroneous views. Only in this way can we avoid the danger of getting lost. Degenerate elements, as Comrade Stalin said in the conclusion of the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), are "people who are not sitting stably on the Bolshevik four-wheeled carriage." They did not use the great power of Marxism-Leninism to maintain the balance of the carriage. As a result, as Stalin said, "When the carriage turns, you see, someone falls out of the carriage." Communists should accept these lessons, be vigilant, and draw a clear line between proletarian and bourgeois ideology in all issues, and adhere to the proletarian stand, viewpoint, and method. In particular, we must consciously use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as weapons of class struggle to conduct ideological transformation in the struggle against corruption and theft. We should always remember that the Party is the advanced and organized force of the working class, a team united under the principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and a force with iron discipline that has grown stronger in the struggle against all opportunism. Therefore, we must never condone, appease, or tolerate any degenerate elements. Degenerate elements are agents of the bourgeoisie. The Party's only means against these people is to resolutely expel them from the Party. If they have committed a crime, they should be handed over to the government to be punished according to their crimes. This is in line with the solemn provisions of the Party Constitution and in line with the interests of the Party, the working class, and the people. Only in this way can we consolidate the Party, consolidate the leadership of the working class, and make the Party's connection with the broad masses closer, and continue to lead the people of the whole country to advance victoriously on the road of revolution.

### 彻底清除对“老资格”的错误观点

    彻底清除对“老资格”的错误观点
    我们的革命能够获得胜利的基本条件之一，是我们的党拥有着千千万万对革命事业抱有无限忠心的革命干部，在这些革命干部中起骨干作用的是久经革命考验，在各个革命时期积累了丰富斗争经验的老干部。老干部代表着我党的优良的传统。代表着共产党人的最高荣誉。斯大林同志是这样看待老干部的，他说：“老干部当然是党和国家底一笔大财富。他们拥有年轻干部所没有的东西，即领导方面的丰富经验，马克思列宁主义的原则锻炼，深谙事理的知识，确定方向的能力。”（在第十八次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告）从老干部身上大家可以学到榜样；学到经验。运用这些经验，就可以避免重复过去的教训。
    我们大多数的老干部，都是斯大林所指的那样的人物。他们耐心地培养新干部。新老干部的亲密团结，是我们战胜一切困难，推进一切工作向前发展的保证。
    但是，这是不是说一切经过长期革命斗争锻炼的老干部，个个都像斯大林所说的那样成熟呢？应该说，大部分是的或者是接近于这样的，但也有一小部分，因为背上了“老资格”的沉重包袱，日益落伍以至堕落了。这一小部分人不是像照斯大林所说的，具有“领导方面的丰富经验，马克思列宁主义的原则锻炼，深谙事理的知识，确定方向的能力”等基本条件，他们仅仅是在党内外以“老字号”的特殊人物自居，发展了严重的个人主义自由主义和无组织无纪律的思想。在革命胜利以后，这些人经不起资产阶级的腐蚀而发生了堕落性质的变化。在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争中，他们的错误行为，被党内外群众揭发出来，他们受到了党纪制裁和法律制裁。根据报载，现已被开除出党或依法受到惩处的老党员有刘青山（前中共河北省石家庄市委副书记）、张子善（前天津地委书记）二人均已处死刑，戴季英（前河南省开封省委书记）、卜盛光（前中南军政委员会公安部部长）、王盛荣（前中南军政委员会工业部副部长），易吉光、周季方（前武汉市副市长）、邓赤（前中国百货公司东北分公司经理），韩永赞（前沈阳工商局局长）等。虽然，他们只是为数不多的几个人。但是，这已经足够说明资产阶级对党的腐蚀的严重性。
    党的组织应当领导党员讨论报上已经发表的这些材料，认清这些人堕落蜕化的严重性质；分析这些人身败名裂的根本原因，从思想上划清阶级界限，这对于肃清党内资产阶级思想影响是有帮助的。
    有些同志觉得这些蜕化分子曾是“老资格”，便对他们抱有“怜悯观点”“可惜观点”。这是一种右倾的思想。这些蜕化分子在过去的确是“老资格”，但在今天他们的老资格已经蜕化变质了。刘少奇同志在“论共产党员的修养”一文中说：“经过长年革命斗争锻炼过来的革命者，并不一定每一个人都成为很好的老练的革命家。”这些人过去虽然作了不少工作，但在实际斗争中他们没有一步一步地提高自己的共产主义觉悟，没有加强自己的革命修养和锻炼，因而长期背上包袱不能大踏步前进。如戴季英虽然参加革命很久，但是他的自私自利的个人主义的品质并没有根本改变；刘青山、张子善长期地压下欺上，居功自傲，独断专行；王盛荣同样也是屡次犯过严重错误而不改正的落后分子。这些人爬上了负责的位置后，便骄傲自满，脱离群众，高高在上，忘记了艰苦的革命斗争，不过严格的组织生活，不进行批评和自我批评。他们的思想意识中保留着浓厚的个人主义思想和剥削阶级意识。革命胜利后，在资产阶级思想猛烈进攻和阶级斗争更加剧烈的条件下，他们的非无产阶级意识更加抬头，他们恬不知耻地以为天下是他们打下来的，现在已到了作威作福的时候。他们的无产阶级的革命意识既然十分薄弱，自然也就经不起考验，结果被资产阶级思想所战胜，成了资产阶级的俘虏。例如东北区百货公司经理邓赤就曾说：“老子革命二十年，出生入死，好容易有了今天。”这是资产阶级思想的最本质的表现，表示他们的革命性的完结。因此，他们的革命历史是早已被资产阶级思想腐蚀掉了。认清这一本质的变化是非常必要的。这样才能从思想上划清敌我界限，把他们看作阶级的异己分子。而不会再对他们抱有什么“怜悯观点”“可惜观点”。
    有些同志认为这些蜕化分子虽有严重毛病，但无论如何过去对党是有功的。因而发生了“将功抵罪”的想法。但是共产党员从来是不应当把功劳只记到个人账上的。革命是党所领导的人民大众的斗争。一切胜利都应当归功于党，归功于工人阶级和其他劳动人民。一切工作成果都是集体力量的创造。共产党员为党为革命作了自己应作的工作，这有什么可以居功的呢？就算他们有着一定的功劳吧，但是，事实证明：只看到“有功”这一面也还是不对的，因为：在资产阶级猛烈袭击下，他们的剥削阶级的思想作风同党的利益发生了根本的矛盾。他们正是凭着自己“有功”，作为“资本”来对抗和破坏党和人民的伟大事业。他们说：“老子们打下了天下，小子们享福”，又说：“别人不敢闹，我敢闹”，“看他们能把我怎样”，他们任意胡作非为，培植个人势力，实行家长统治，压制民主，肆意打击党内坚持原则斗争的同志，陷害好人，压迫人民群众。发展了同国民党反动统治者并无二致的剥削阶级的作风，刘青山、张子善打击了代表党的正确原则的天津党组织的党员干部和广大群众，借以掩盖他们可耻的叛变行为。周季方、宋瑛打击了孙麦龄等坚决同他们错误行为作斗争的党员干部和纪凯夫等进步群众。戴季英到处攻击河南省委，“提高自己打击别人，凡对他的错误进行斗争的人，他就认为是攻击他，排挤他，破坏他，因而他就实行报复，打击这些人”（见中共河南省委开除戴季英党籍的决定）。易吉光在武汉市人民政府副市长任期内收留并重用了曾任伪专员的中统特务和曾经镇压过学生运动的伪县长、恶霸、伪警察刑事队队副等，他实际上是和这些人结成了反革命的集团。这是个人主义、自由主义发展到了敌我不分的地步而必然产生的一个结果。在资产阶级进攻的条件下，这种腐朽的个人主义必然要同资产阶级思想结成一体，成为资产阶级从内部来夺取革命堡垒的最便利的工具。纵容了这些人的错误，便是助长了资产阶级的猖狂进攻，就会有亡国亡党亡身的危险。这是问题的实质。既然他们过去的“功”已经完全抵不了今天的“罪”，因此，把“功”和“罪”平列起来的看法正是模糊了阶级斗争的观点的右倾错误思想。
    也有人认为：邓赤、王盛荣、卜盛光这些人的蜕化主要是由于生活不检点。这种看法是完全错误的。这些人在进城以后，由于他们一味追求资产阶级的腐朽生活，结果，必然地发展了资本主义的思想，因而发生了品质的变化。资产阶级正是利用这一弱点来腐化他们，然后，再利用他们的“职权”，利用他们的“老资格”作为护符来组织盗窃国家资财的集团，进一步向国家和人民举行严重的进攻。罗荣春所领导的东北医药公司完全变成了私商投机倒把的机构，仅就他们投机取巧、偷漏国税一项来说，就使国家损失了前东北币四十五亿五千万元。东北区百货公司邓赤盗窃国家的铁和各种机器，伙同奸商开工厂，还以他儿子的名义向私商投资入股。蜕化分子把这些“股份”、“工厂”、“商店”作为自己将来公开叛变革命，投靠资产阶级的“后路”。王盛荣到处吹嘘“有色金属工业是摇钱树”，有色金属管理局“看一两亿元像吃饭掉下的米粒一样”。这些国营企业成了贪污犯和盗窃犯的王国，当然也就不能不改变国营企业的社会主义性质而变成资本主义的“摇钱树”。资产阶级从生活上的腐蚀，使他们陷入资本主义无底的深渊而不能自拔。其结果，是使党、工人阶级和全国人民受到严重的危害和影响。能够说这是生活问题吗？一个共产党员，应当在各方面，在自己全部活动和生活中都成为共产主义者，这是伟大列宁的教导。卜盛光等人背叛了共产主义的原则，因此，他们便只好堕落为资产阶级分子了。
    党内斗争是阶级斗争的反映。关于这一点，我们完全可以从这一小部分老干部蜕化变质的沉痛教训中得到深刻的说明。每一个同志都应当深切地体会到，如果一个共产党员不确立共产主义的崇高思想，并全心全意地为它的实现而奋斗到底，资产阶级的思想就可以完全腐蚀他，以至断送他的光荣的斗争历史，使他身败名裂，成为敌对阶级的一分子。
    共产党员保持自己光荣的斗争历史的基本条件，就是要在实际工作中学会掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，不断地提高自己的党性，同一切错误观点进行不调和的斗争。只有这样，才能避免迷失路途的危险。蜕化分子正像斯大林同志在联共（布）中央第十五次党代表大会的结论中所说的，是“不稳固地坐在布尔塞维克的四轮车上的人”，他们没有用马克思列宁主义的伟大力量来保持车子的平衡。结果，也正如斯大林所说：“车子一转湾，你们看，便有人跌出车外去了。”共产党员应当接受这些教训，警惕起来，在一切问题上都要划清无产阶级和资产阶级的思想界限，坚持无产阶级的立场、观点和方法。特别是要在反贪污、反盗窃的斗争中自觉地运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想作为阶级斗争的武器，进行思想改造。应当时刻记住：党是工人阶级先进的有组织的部队，是在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想原则下统一起来的队伍，党是在反对一切机会主义的斗争中壮大起来的有着铁的纪律的部队。因此，我们绝不能姑息、迁就以及容忍任何一个蜕化分子。蜕化分子是资产阶级的代理人，党对这些人的唯一手段就是坚决地开除他们出党，如果他们犯了法，则交由政府按其罪行给以应得的处罚。这是符合于党章的庄严规定，是符合于党、工人阶级和人民利益的。只有这样，才能巩固党、巩固工人阶级的领导权，并使党同广大群众的联系更加密切，继续领导全国人民在革命的道路上胜利前进。
