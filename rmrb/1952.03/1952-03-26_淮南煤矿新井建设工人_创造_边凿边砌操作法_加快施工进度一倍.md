Workers Building New Wells at the Huainan Coal Mine Create “Simultaneous Drilling and Lining Operation Method” to Accelerate Construction Progress by One Fold

The staff and workers building new wells at the state-owned Huainan Coal Mine have created the "simultaneous drilling and lining operation method," which can complete the construction plan in half the time. They have also improved the drilling and lining techniques, increasing production efficiency by 1.5 times compared to the Kuomintang rule and 3.5 times compared to the Japanese occupation. The "simultaneous drilling and lining operation method" was proposed by technical personnel in October of last year. It divides a well's suspended platform into two layers, with lining workers standing on the platform to line the well, while drilling workers simultaneously drill the well below the platform. One or two safety platforms are installed below the suspended platform, ensuring the complete safety of the workers drilling below. According to the old method, drilling and lining could not be done simultaneously, resulting in slow project progress. Now, with simultaneous drilling and lining, two days' work can be completed in one day.

After the successful trial of the "simultaneous drilling and lining operation method," workers building new wells actively sought to improve their techniques. Drilling workers increased the depth of the shot holes from 50-60 centimeters to 1.2 meters. The number of shot holes and the amount of explosives were determined based on the nature of the rock. This greatly improved efficiency and saved a large amount of explosives and detonators. Lining workers first washed the rock debris and sand filling the back of the well curbing stones with water before mixing them with cement. After the rock debris and cement slurry were poured behind the well curbing stones, they were compacted downward with iron rods. They also covered the lined well curbs with burlap sacks to prevent dust from falling on the wet cement, so the quality of the new wells was greatly improved compared to before. During the current anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, drilling workers created a new record of four meters per shift, and lining workers created a new record of 3.5 meters of well lining per shift.

### 淮南煤矿新井建设工人  创造“边凿边砌操作法”加快施工进度一倍

    淮南煤矿新井建设工人
    创造“边凿边砌操作法”加快施工进度一倍
    国营淮南煤矿建设新井的职工，创造了“边凿边砌操作法”，可使施工计划提前一半时间完成。他们又改进了凿井、砌井的技术，使生产效率比国民党统治时期提高了一倍半，比日寇占领时期提高三倍半。“边凿边砌操作法”是在去年十月间由技术人员提出的。它把一个井用吊盘分为两层，砌井工人站在吊盘上砌井，凿井工人同时在吊盘下面凿井。在吊盘下面安置有一个到两个保险盘，所以在下面凿井的工人的安全有完全的保障。按照过去的老方法是凿井就不能砌井，砌井就不能凿井，工程进度缓慢。现在一边凿一边砌，两天的活一天就可以完成。
    “边凿边砌操作法”试验成功后，建设新井的工人又纷纷设法改进技术。凿井工人打的炮眼由五、六十公分加深到一点二公尺，炮眼的数目，装药的数量，按岩石的性质而定。这样效率就大大提高，还节省了大批炸药和雷管。砌井的工人先把灌到井圈石后面的石碴子和沙子用水洗干净，然后才拌上洋灰，在石碴和洋灰浆灌进井圈石后面以后再用铁钎子向下捣实。他们又在砌好的井圈上盖麻袋，避免灰尘落到湿洋灰上，所以新井质量也比以前大为提高。在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，凿井工人创造了一圆班进四公尺，砌井工人创造了一圆班砌好三点五公尺的新纪录。（新华社）
