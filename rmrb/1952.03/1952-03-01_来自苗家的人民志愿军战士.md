A dispatch from Korea:

People's Volunteer Army Fighters from the Miao Ethnic Group
Li Keyi

	One morning in November 1951, in a village somewhere in northern Korea, people in every household were busily threshing grain on their yards. Although it was a war environment, with enemy planes constantly flying overhead, the land was filled with a scene of harvest, and songs echoed melodiously. Living here were Korean farmers and soldiers from a certain railway unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The soldiers worked as if they were on their own yards. At the entrance of one house, several young soldiers were helping the Korean people thresh soybeans while singing loudly, singing very pleasantly and happily, but I couldn't understand what they were singing. So, I stepped forward and asked:
	"What are you singing?"
	"Miao songs."
	It turned out that these were Volunteer Army soldiers from the Miao ethnic group in the southwest of our motherland. I was very excited, so I sat on the bean stalks and started talking to them. One of the soldiers pointed to the beautiful mountains around and said to me, "Our hometown is very similar to Korea, with mountains like this and springs like this; the difference is that the soil in our home is black, while the soil here is reddish. Our hometown has been getting better and better since Chairman Mao came; but Korea has been devastated so badly by American imperialism!"
	This soldier was called Li Bigang, and his home was in Baisha Township, Shiqian County, Guizhou. Before liberation, his family only had "half a cow's worth" of land. In May 1951, the farmers of Baisha Township overthrew the local tyrant landlord, and his family was allocated thirty loads of paddy fields. In June, Li Bigang got married. But less than two months after his marriage, Li Bigang joined the Volunteer Army, trekking nearly ten thousand miles to the Korean front line. Why? He said:
	"I'm not just protecting my thirty loads of paddy fields, I'm doing it for the motherland, for everyone—of course, also for our entire Miao people to be free from suffering and to never live in that dark, sunless days again."
	Li Bigang said that his past life was full of endless suffering. When he was eight years old, his father rented twenty loads of fields from the landlord. In addition to paying ten loads of grain as rent, Li Bigang had to look after the landlord's cattle. Li Bigang's face clouded over as he spoke. He said:
	"For twelve years, from the age of eight to twenty, the landlord only gave me five yuan, a set of tattered clothes: and these scars on my face and head!" He pointed to these scars to show me: "These were beaten by the landlord. Fortunately, Chairman Mao came and rescued me from the dark hell." Li Bigang's eyes were particularly bright when he talked about Chairman Mao: "We Miao people all say this: now things are great, Chairman Mao has come! Although none of us have ever seen Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao has never been to our Miao area, but since liberation, we feel that Chairman Mao is living in our Miao area, right beside us! Whenever we see the green rice in the fields, see the fat buffalo walking in the fields, see the girls wearing new clothes, see anything that makes people happy, we say: 'Chairman Mao has really come.' In the past, Chiang Kai-shek oppressed us and didn't treat us like human beings. We never want to live those days again. We must protect our good days! We knew long ago that American imperialism is Chiang Kai-shek's godfather. He is killing and setting fires in Korea today, which means he will go to China to kill and set fires tomorrow. Join the Volunteer Army! Cut off the claws of these devils! China is a big family of loving ethnic groups. Resisting America and aiding Korea protects this big family, and our Miao people must also contribute." Li Bigang smiled and then said: "When I was about to leave for the front, my wife, Bingnv, told me—go! Whatever the people ask you to do, whatever Chairman Mao asks you to do, you must do it well!..."
	After saying this, he pondered and didn't continue. "Our Miao girls are really great!" Next to speak was Comrade Ou Dexin, from Dahe Township, Taijiang County, Guizhou. He said, "Many Miao girls heard that we had joined the Volunteer Army, and they also scrambled to come. They carried clothes and baggage and walked in groups of twenty or thirty miles to the district to sign up. The district said: girls can't go, work hard at home to support the resistance against America and aid Korea. Until the evening, the district still didn't agree, and the girls had no choice but to leave with tears in their eyes. On the day we set off, they put on colorful new clothes, sang their own new songs to send us off, and prepared so much sweet wine for us to drink, and sent us all the way to Shidongkou, sixty miles from home. They also told us: be sure to wipe out the American bandits and protect our homes well so that you can return to our Dahe Township."
	Comrade Ou Dexin, nineteen years old this year, is a member of the Communist Youth League. He is strong and brave in his work. The day before, enemy planes came to harass our railway line. Ou Dexin was digging soil when a bomb exploded not far from him, burying him in the soil, and his face and head were injured. Comrades advised him to go back to rest, but he refused, and he worked even harder. Within an hour, he dug one and a half cubic meters of earth, creating an amazing record in engineering. He said: "I hate the American aggressors to the bone! Those bandits owe us a sea of blood and deep-seated hatred!" Ou Dexin always remembered that a few years ago, the Chiang Kai-shek gang let the American bandits build an airport in Huangping County, Guizhou, and went to every household to grab conscripts. Ou Dexin's brother went out through the back door of the house to swim away, but was shot and killed by an American soldier; after he was already dead, they shot the corpse three or four more times. After his brother died, they also arrested his father, and his father didn't come back alive either. When his father was forced to work on the airport runway, he was cut into several pieces by the propeller of an American plane. Ou Dexin's eyes flashed with angry tears as he said:
	"Guess what! What did the American bandits say? They said that killing a Chinese person is the same as killing a chicken!" Ou Dexin twisted his fists forcefully, and he said excitedly: "In order to build the airport for the Americans, it wasn't just my father and brother who died. In our Miao family alone, three or four thousand people died, starved to death, frozen to death, tortured to death, crushed to death by planes, run over by cars... too many!" The fire of anger burned in his chest, and his words seemed to burst out from a volcano: "I came to Korea, and I saw American planes flying wildly over Korea again, bombing everywhere, and I shivered with hatred! Comrade! Do you understand why our Miao people came to resist America and aid Korea? We are now soldiers of the Volunteer Army Railway Force. We are desperately repairing the railway. Our railway is an indestructible steel transportation line!"
	Their squad leader, Long Fujin, is from Chawen Town, Taijiang County, Guizhou. He said: "Whenever we see American bandits dropping bombs on the railway, we think of the rails laid on the land of our motherland, how great that is! These railway transportations, which are now owned by the people, bring so much happiness to our motherland. Thinking of this, we work even harder. No matter how the enemy bombs, we must ensure that the ammunition and supplies sent by the people of the motherland are transported to the front." He said in a relaxed tone: "Our troops are both home and school." Then he told me how, when they first arrived, the old soldiers used sorghum stalks as rails and clods of earth as ballast, patiently teaching him construction techniques bit by bit; and how the old soldiers cared for their lives like older brothers. These soldiers from the Miao ethnic group have shown the same strength and bravery as the veteran soldiers in the struggle, and they have also mastered the technology to a basic level.
	When I shook hands with them to say goodbye, Ou Dexin took out a piece of paper from his pocket to show me. Although the words on it were not written very well, it was clear that they were written with care. He wrote:
	"Chairman Mao: Your Miao children have also come to resist America and aid Korea. Because we love you, love our motherland's big family, we guarantee that the trains will run every day. For our Chairman Mao, for our motherland, and also to win glory for our Miao family. We will surely be victorious!"
	His face was like a red cloth, and he said excitedly, "I want to send this letter to Chairman Mao."
	How touching are the pure feelings of the Miao soldiers! From their conversations, we can understand what kind of force has transformed these young farmers, who were still working in the green hills and clear waters of the countryside just a few months ago, into the "most beloved people" admired by people all over the world. All glory belongs to our great leader Chairman Mao, to our great motherland and people, and to all our dear comrades in the Volunteer Army!

    来自苗家的人民志愿军战士
    李克异
    一九五一年十一月有一天上午，在朝鲜北部某地的村庄里，家家户户的场上，都有许多人在那里熙熙攘攘地忙着打场。虽然这里是战争环境，不时有敌人的飞机从高空中掠过，但大地上一片丰收的景象，歌声在悠扬地荡漾着。这里居住的是朝鲜农户和我人民志愿军铁道部队某部的战士们。战士们像在自己的场上一样地工作着。在一家门口，几个年轻的战士一边帮着朝鲜人民打豆子，一边高声地歌唱，唱得非常动听，非常快乐，但我却听不懂他们在唱些什么。于是，我走上前去问道：
    “你们在唱什么？”
    “苗家歌。”
    原来这是来自我们祖国西南苗家的志愿军战士。我感到异常兴奋，就坐在豆秸上和他们谈起话来。其中一个战士指着四周美丽的山岭对我说：“我们的家乡很像朝鲜，也是这样的山，也是这样的泉水；不同的是我们家的土质是黑的，这里的土发红。我们的家乡自从毛主席来了，日子一天比一天好了；可是朝鲜让美帝国主义蹧蹋得多惨啊！”
    这个战士叫李碧岗，他的家住在贵州石阡县白砂乡。解放前他家只有“半边牛”。一九五一年五月，白砂乡的农民斗倒了恶霸地主，他家分得了三十挑水田。六月，李碧岗结了婚。可是结婚还不到两个月，李碧岗就参加了志愿军，跋踄近万里，来到了朝鲜前线。为什么呢？他说：
    “我可不只是为了保住我那三十挑水田，我是为了祖国，为了大家——当然也是为了我们全体苗家再不受苦，再不过那没有太阳的黑暗日子。”
    李碧岗说他以往的日子是受不尽的苦。他八岁的时候，父亲从地主那里租来二十挑田，除了拿十挑田的谷子去缴租以外，李碧岗还得给地主去看牛。李碧岗说着脸上罩上了一层暗云。他说：
    “从八岁到二十岁，整整十二年，地主只给了我五块钱，一套破烂衣服：还有我脸上和头上的这些疤！”他指着这些疤给我看：“这是地主打的。幸而毛主席来了，把我从黑暗的地狱里救了出来。”说到毛主席时，李碧岗的两眼分外明亮：“我们苗家都是这样说：现在可好了，毛主席来了！虽然我们都没看见过毛主席，毛主席也没到过我们苗家，可是自从解放以后，我们觉得毛主席就在我们苗家住着，就在我们身边呢！我们一看到田野里绿油油的稻子，看见肥大的水牛在田里走来走去，看见穿上了新衣服的姑娘们，看见不管什么让人快乐的事，我们就说：‘真是毛主席来了’。从前，蒋介石欺压我们，不把我们当人看，那样的日子我们再也不愿意过了，好日子我们得好好地保住呀！我们早知道美帝国主义是蒋介石的干爷，他今天在朝鲜杀人放火，也就是为了明天到咱中国去杀人放火。参加志愿军！把这些恶鬼的魔爪给砍断！中国是各民族友爱的大家庭，抗美援朝保住这个大家庭，我们苗家也要出一份力量。”李碧岗笑了笑，然后说：“我临来前线的时候，我的老婆丙女嘱咐我——去吧！人民叫你干什么，毛主席叫你干什么，就得好好地去干呀！……”
    讲完这句话，他沉思着没有再讲下去。 “我们苗家姑娘们可真好呢！”接下去说的是家住贵州台江县蹈和乡的欧德新同志，他说：“苗家许多姑娘听说我们参加志愿军了，她们也争着要来，她们背了衣裳包袱，成群结队地走了二、三十里路到区上去报名。区上说：姑娘们不能去，在家里努力生产来抗美援朝吧。一直到晚上，区上还是不答应，姑娘们没法子，才抹着眼泪走了。我们出发的那天，她们穿上花花绿绿的新衣服，纵情地唱着自己编的新歌来欢送我们，还预备了那样多的甜酒给我们喝，一直把我们送到离家六十里路的施洞口。她们还嘱咐我们说：一定要把美国强盗给打干净，把家保好，你们才能回咱蹈和乡来。”
    欧德新同志，今年十九岁，是个青年团员，他在工作中坚强而勇敢。前一天，敌机来袭扰我们的铁道线，欧德新正在挖土，一颗炸弹在他不远的地方爆炸了，把他埋在土里，脸上和头上全受了伤，同志们劝他回去休息，他不肯，他却更加努力地工作。在一个小时内他挖了一方半土，创造了工程上的惊人纪录。他说：“我恨透了美国侵略军，那些强盗对我们欠下了血海深仇！”欧德新时刻都记得，几年前蒋介石匪帮让美国强盗在贵州黄平县修飞机场，到每家每户去抓壮丁，欧德新的哥哥从家里的后门出去泅水逃走，被美国兵一枪打死了；人已经死了，还对着尸体连打了三、四枪。哥哥死了，又把父亲抓去，父亲也没活着回来。父亲被迫在飞机场跑道上给他们干活时，被一架美国飞机的螺旋桨给绞成了好几段。欧德新两眼闪着愤恨的泪光说：
    “你猜！美国强盗说什么？他们说死一个中国人和死一只鸡一样！”欧德新用力地扭动着他的双拳，他激愤地说：“为了给美国人修飞机场，死的不只是我的父亲和哥哥，光我们苗家就死了三、四千人，饿死的，冻死的，给折磨死的，给飞机碾死的，给汽车轧死的……太多了！”愤怒的烈火在他胸腔中燃烧着，他的话像是从火山中迸出来的：“我来到朝鲜，我又看到美国飞机在朝鲜上空疯狂地飞，到处滥炸，我全身恨得发抖呀！同志！你明白我们苗家为什么来抗美援朝了吗？我们现在是志愿军铁道部队的战士，我们拚命把铁路修好，我们的铁路是炸不烂的钢铁运输线！”
    他们的班长龙福金是贵州台江县差文镇人。他说：“我们每逢看到美国强盗在铁路上丢炸弹，我们就想到我们祖国的大地上铺着的铁轨，那有多么好！这些现在已为人民所有的铁道运输，给我们的祖国带来多大的幸福啊。一想到这里，我们工作得就更起劲，不管敌人怎么炸，我们也得保证把祖国人民送来的弹药和物资运送到前方。”他带着轻松的口吻说：“我们部队又是家，又是学校。”于是他又告诉我他们刚一来时，老战士们如何用秫秸当铁轨，用土块当石碴，一点一点地耐心地教给他修筑技术；老战士又如何像亲哥哥一样地关心他们的生活。这些来自苗家的战士们，在斗争中表现得和老战士一样的坚强和勇敢，而且他们已初步地掌握了技术。
    当我和他们握别时，欧德新从衣袋里取出一张纸来给我看，上面的字虽然写得不太好，但很显然地可以看出这是用心写的。他写的是：
    “毛主席：你的苗家孩子们也来抗美援朝了。因为我们爱你，爱我们的祖国大家庭，我们保证火车天天开。为我们的毛主席，为我们的祖国，也为我们的苗家争光。我们一定能胜利！”
    他的脸像一块红布，兴奋地说：“我想把这封信寄给毛主席。”
    苗家战士们这种纯朴的情感是如何地感动人啊。从他们的谈话中，我们可以认识到是一种什么力量，使得这些几个月以前还是在青山绿水的乡村中劳动的青年农民们，变成为全世界人民所景仰的“最可爱的人”了。一切光荣属于我们伟大的领袖毛主席，属于我们伟大的祖国和人民，属于我们亲爱的志愿军全体同志们！
