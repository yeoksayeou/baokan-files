I. General Situation of Chuandi Village and Basic Requirements of Local Farmers

In order to study the new issue of agricultural production cooperatives, I went to Chuandi Village in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, on December 11, 1951, to investigate the agricultural production cooperative in this village. Li Xiantang, Secretary of the Pingshun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Li Yuxian, Secretary of the County Committee, participated in this investigation. During the investigation, we first held discussions with the CCP branch secretary and key members of the village, that is, the key members of the agricultural production cooperative such as the cooperative director and team leaders, then held discussions with all cooperative members, then held discussions with the leaders or representatives of the eight mutual aid teams in the village that had not yet organized agricultural production cooperatives, then invited eight peasant households who had previously been in the same mutual aid team with the current members of the agricultural production cooperative but had doubts about the agricultural production cooperative in the spring of 1951 and therefore did not participate in the agricultural production cooperative, and finally invited five women representatives from the cooperative members to hold discussions.

Chuandi Village is a representative mountainous village in the old liberated area of North China. It is located in the Taihang Mountains, with very little cultivated land and a shortage of water. The problem of drinking water for people and livestock is also solved by cellar water, and the production conditions are relatively difficult. Now the entire administrative village has 94 households, 366 people, and 724 mu of land. The whole village has long been middle-peasantized. There are 93 middle-peasant households (including 9 old middle-peasant households), and the other household with a relatively poor life is a former rich peasant who was struggled against in the past. The whole village has 29 party members and 14 members of the Communist Youth League. Before the agricultural production cooperative was organized in April 1951, there were already ten mutual aid teams in the village, including 88 households, that is to say, most of the farmers had been organized in the form of mutual aid teams to varying degrees. In the spring of 1951, after two mutual aid teams merged to form an agricultural production cooperative, there were still eight mutual aid teams, including 70 households. The mutual aid movement in this village began in 1943 and has never stopped. The average agricultural production of the whole village in 1950 had exceeded the pre-war level by 50%. The average yield per mu before the war was 210 jin (1 shi and 4 dou), and in 1950 it was 316.5 jin (2 shi, 1 dou, and 1 sheng). In 1950, the whole village had 58 draught animals and 201 sheep; in 1943, there were less than 20 draught animals and only 30 to 40 sheep. At the Shanxi Provincial Labor Model Conference in November 1950, Chuandi Village, Xigou Village of Li Shunda, and Xiedaopo Village of Yang Fengshan in the same county were all rated as production model villages among the eleven provincial production model villages selected. The whole village now has some public property, including: (1) agricultural tools: three five-inch plows, one chaff cutter, two thermometers, one small corn thresher, three sprayers, and five old-style drills; (2) houses and other equipment: two rooms, five cave dwellings, three water pools, fifteen water wells, nine millstones, five grinders, nineteen benches, and twenty-four tables; (3) public mountain forests of four to five hundred mu, with about 300,000 small trees (mainly pine, cypress, peach, and apricot).

In terms of culture and education, there are one primary school, one people's school, and one library. The library has 440 books, 5 copies of current affairs manuals and propaganda manuals, 1 copy of the People's Daily, 2 copies of the Shanxi Daily, some copies of the Shanxi Peasant Daily, and 1 copy of the Shanxi Youth Daily. There are also many blackboard newspapers in the village; oral broadcasts are held every night.

The agricultural production cooperative is now the most respected and yearned for by the masses in Chuandi Village. It is one of the ten agricultural production cooperatives piloted by the CCP Changzhi Prefectural Committee in Shanxi. When it was established in April 1951, it had 18 households and 76 people, including 21 full laborers and 16 female laborers. Most of the party members and key members of the village joined the cooperative. The whole cooperative has 152.7 mu of land, with 107 mu joining the cooperative and 45.7 mu of private plots for cooperative members, of which 92 mu were actually managed by the cooperative in a unified way in 1951 (15 mu of wheat fields were sown in the autumn of 1950 and were still harvested by the original planting households in 1951). This cooperative was formed by the merger of two mutual aid teams, one was the Guo Yu'en mutual aid team, and the other was the Guo Xiaoyou mutual aid team. The Guo Yu'en mutual aid team was established in 1943. At that time, there were only three draught animals and seven sheep. It was selected as the second-class model mutual aid team in the Taihang area in 1944; in 1946, because the number of team members increased to 24 households, 12 households were separated to form the Guo Xiaoyou mutual aid team. The average yield of the Guo Yu'en mutual aid team in 1950 was 342 jin per mu (2 shi and 2 dou and 8 sheng), exceeding the pre-war level by 63%. By 1950, the number of draught animals had increased to 8 and sheep to 43. In 1950, the Guo Yu'en team had 1,245 jin (8 shi and 3 dou) of public reserve grain and 15 pieces of public old-style farm tools; the Guo Xiaoyou team had 19 pieces of public old-style farm tools (but no public reserve grain). Before the organization of the production cooperative, the two teams had a total of 26 households, and 8 households withdrew when the cooperative was formed.

The simple situation of the other eight mutual aid teams is: the team with the most households has 13 households, and the team with the fewest households has 4 households; on average, each team has 6 or 7 pieces of public old-style farm tools, one of which has a public mare.

During the investigation, we first paid attention to studying the basic requirements of the farmers in Chuandi Village. After the tendency of the so-called "poor and hired peasant line" was corrected in 1948, from 1949 onwards, the most basic requirement of the farmers in Chuandi Village was to expand reproduction on the basis of the original mutual aid teams. However, the organizational form of mutual aid teams could no longer basically meet the needs of farmers for further development of production. From 1943 to 1948, during the six years, the mutual aid team played a great role in the production of farmers. The key was to solve the difficulty of labor and animal power, and the second was to solve some technical problems in agricultural production (such as seed soaking, seed selection, seed exchange, promotion of Golden Queen corn, Da Longgu, two-legged drill, etc.). However, after 1948, the difficulties of labor and animal power were generally solved. The above-mentioned technical improvements could also be generally implemented. The era of "half a year of coarse grain and vegetables" in the lives of farmers had basically passed. At this time, the farmers in this village mainly had the following requirements in production: First, it was deep plowing, but there was not enough animal power, and they wanted to buy good livestock, but individual farmers did not have the capital; second, it was to increase fertilizer, but they could not afford sheep flocks (local farmers mainly used sheep manure as fertilizer); third, due to the collective labor of the mutual aid team, there was a surplus of labor, but these surplus labor could not be used in a planned way for sideline production, because everyone had to take care of their own small piece of land; fourth, the farmers were no longer satisfied with the original land use methods, because the land was too scattered, and it was impossible to implement planting according to local conditions, and they could only carry out production under very uneconomical conditions according to the needs of their own small families; fifth, they could not afford larger and better farm tools; sixth, they could not carry out larger land processing. However, the mutual aid team, as an economic organization, could not fundamentally solve the above problems. Therefore, the phenomenon of disintegration occurred universally in mutual aid teams. Even the Guo Yu'en mutual aid team, which was relatively progressive, although better than the general mutual aid teams in the area, was, according to Guo Yu'en himself, "formalistic." As mutual aid team member Li Xicun said: "The mutual aid team is just like this, it will never be improved." In February 1950, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the policy of "combining organization and technical improvement," which played a significant role in improving and consolidating the generally disintegrating mutual aid teams that had begun at that time. But if "organization" is limited only to the form of "mutual aid team" without including more advanced forms, it still cannot meet the needs of farmers. As far as Chuandi Village is concerned, most of the technologies that could be adopted on the basis of mutual aid teams had been adopted. In this case, farmers could not see that the road of "organization" could further develop production, so they spontaneously took the road of developing production independently. They became complacent with the current economic situation and thought they could develop independently. They said: "Get up early to eat gatada (corn cake and yam), sorghum rice for lunch, bean porridge for supper, that's good enough." However, under the new democratic system, the road for farmers to develop independently is very small and short, and there is no bright future in this regard. In politics, local farmers have developed the idea of "successful revolution" since 1949, lost their sense of enemy, and thought that there were no more enemies after the landlord class, Japanese imperialism, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang were overthrown. Therefore, they became indifferent to joining the army, were not enthusiastic about paying public grain, and became alienated from working cadres. It was already very difficult for cadres to get meals when they went to the village. This was a period when rural work was lax, and farmers and rural cadres felt very depressed. The anti-American and aid-Korea patriotic movement that began in the winter of 1950, and the subsequent suppression of counter-revolutionaries, established a new sense of enemy among the farmers and aroused a new fighting will among the farmers. Economically, after the CCP Changzhi Prefectural Committee began piloting agricultural production cooperatives in April 1951 in accordance with the decision of the CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee, the farmers in Chuandi Village once again discovered the vast prospect of further developing production by taking the road of organization. When this cooperative was being prepared and piloted, some of the main cadres in the village were initially hesitant; while the vast majority of members of the mutual aid teams expressed their enthusiastic support for the agricultural production cooperative, which reflected the farmers' desire to further develop production.

II. Agricultural Production Cooperatives Significantly Increased Farmers' Productivity and Met Farmers' Requirements for Further Expanding Reproduction

According to the summary of the seven months from April to October 1951, the agricultural production cooperative of Chuandi Village achieved tremendous results in production far exceeding those of the mutual aid teams. This achievement is reflected in three aspects: agriculture, sideline occupations, and investment in expanded production.

First, in terms of agriculture: the unit area yield was greatly increased. The average yield per mu of the agricultural production cooperative in 1951 was 454 jin (3 shi, 2 dou, and 6 he), which was 112 jin (7 dou and 4 sheng and 6 he) more per mu than in 1950, that is, an increase of 32.7% compared with 1950, 19.4% more than the average yield of 381 jin (2 shi and 5 dou and 4 sheng) per mu of the Guo Haibei team, a good mutual aid team in Chuandi Village in the same year, 44% more than the average yield of 315 jin (2 shi and 1 dou) per mu of Guo Tianfu, a strong individual household in Chuandi Village in the same year, 244 jin (1 shi, 6 dou, and 2 sheng and 6 he) more than before the war, that is, an increase of 116%. The highest yield of the agricultural production cooperative was 1,050 jin of Golden Queen corn per mu, which was 71% more than the highest yield of 615 jin per mu of the mutual aid team, and twice more than the highest yield of 525 jin per mu of the individual household.

The agricultural labor productivity has been improved. In 1950, the mutual aid team spent 18 workdays per mu of land, and in 1951, it spent 14 workdays. The labor productivity per mu increased by 22.2%, and the quality of cultivation was better than in the past.

The cultivated area has also been expanded. Due to the cancellation of the seven ridges between the members' lands on the same plane, 28 corners of the land were cancelled, and the area was expanded by half a mu, saving 45 workdays. However, in order to protect the private ownership of land, the boundary of the land was buried underground after public discussion by the members.

Second, in terms of sideline occupations: in seven months, a total of 10,250 jin of coarse grains were produced, which was 388% more than the 2,100 jin of grain produced by the two mutual aid teams in sideline production in 1950, accounting for 28% of the total agricultural income of the cooperative and 30% of the total sideline income of the village. In 1951, the main participants in sideline production were eight full laborers, and the main sideline occupation was carpentry.

Third, in terms of investment in expanding agricultural and sideline production: in seven months, 13,280 jin of coarse grains have been invested in expanding reproduction. In addition, there are 3,532 jin of public reserve grain, which will be mostly invested in expanding reproduction.

The reason why the agricultural production cooperative can significantly improve the productivity of farmers is that it has the following advantages:

First, on the land issue, the agricultural production cooperative unprecedentedly solved the problem of rational use of the land of the entire cooperative under the principle of unified management on the basis of the private ownership of land by farmers. For the first time, farmers changed from the passive production situation of "planting whatever they eat" to the active situation of "planting whatever is suitable." This greatly exerted the productive power of the land. Secondly, the land was generally processed, and the basic construction of the land was gradually carried out. This cooperative planned to convert 11 mu of slope land into terraced fields in the winter of 1951 and the spring of 1952, and to level 21 mu of uneven land.

Second, on the labor issue, there have been great changes. First of all, the labor enthusiasm of the members has been unprecedentedly improved. The members ask to be assigned work every day, and they feel dissatisfied when there is no work, and they are unwilling to rest. The original scattered surplus labor in the mutual aid team is now concentrated, and the surplus labor has been expanded, creating conditions for the planned use of the surplus labor in sideline production. In 1951, this cooperative concentrated eight surplus laborers to engage in sideline production all year round. In 1952, it planned to use the surplus labor in sideline occupations and basic land construction. The special skills of each member in labor can now be rationally divided. The entire cooperative is divided into three teams (two agricultural teams and one sideline occupation team), and each team has specific divisions of labor. For example, those with carpentry skills engage in sideline occupations; in agricultural production, those who are good at plowing are responsible for plowing, those who are good at sowing are responsible for sowing, those who are good at raising livestock are responsible for raising livestock, those with rich technical experience serve as technical guidance, those with great strength do heavy work, those with less strength do light work, and the labor enthusiasm of women is also fully mobilized. In 1951, this cooperative had 16 women engaged in major agricultural labor, and 7 elderly women engaged in minor labor such as threshing. In seven months, the women worked a total of 300 "workdays," with the most doing 34 "workdays" and the average doing 20 "workdays." Women and men are paid equally for equal work. Women also have appropriate divisions of labor according to their physical strength and special skills. In household labor, many women now take on heavy tasks such as carrying water, which were previously the responsibility of men.

As for the use of draught animals, this cooperative now uses the method of discounting wages; in the future, it plans to include them all in the cooperative. There has been no dispute in this regard so far.

Third, on the fertilizer issue, there have also been the following changes. First of all, most of the fertilizer of the whole cooperative, totaling 9,016 dan, was concentrated by means of price investment. The sheep flocks and livestock of the cooperative accumulated more than 1,900 dan of fertilizer, increasing the source of fertilizer. Therefore, fertilization has increased. In 1951, the average fertilization per mu was 98 dan, which was more than 13 dan per mu than the average in 1950, that is, more than 15%, more than 23 dan per mu than the good mutual aid team in the same village, that is, more than 30%, and more than 40 dan per mu than the individual households in the same village, that is, 69%. The highest fertilization amount per mu of the cooperative land was 123 dan. Due to the unified management of land and the centralized use of fertilizer, it is possible to fertilize according to local conditions. For example, green manure on red soil, human manure and sheep manure on yellow-black soil, and mule and horse manure on white soil; human manure, sheep manure, and oil cake fertilizer on shady land, and cattle manure and pig manure on sunny land. When transporting fertilizer to the land, it can be transported nearby. For example, the manure in the north of the village is transported to the land in the north of the village; the manure in the south of the village is transported to the land in the south of the village. Therefore, 54 workdays were saved. In 1952, the sheep flocks of this cooperative will lie down to fertilize on the spot, saving even more workdays.

Fourth, there have also been great improvements in cultivation techniques. The most significant change is the universal use of new-style farm tools, overcoming the conservative ideas of some members. They have achieved universal deep plowing and more plowing. In the past, the general plowing depth was three inches, and in 1951, it was uniformly plowed to a depth of four inches. In the past, some plowed three times, and most plowed twice. In 1951, all plowed three times. In the past, due to the scattered use of labor and animal power, the autumn harvest and autumn plowing could not be combined in time, and the soil fertility could not be restored early. Some lands could not be plowed before the ground froze and could only be started in the spring of the following year; now it is possible to achieve timely autumn plowing. They universally adopted improved varieties and uniformly used progressive methods to implement seed dressing with medicine. The number of weeding times has also been increased, and the retention of seedlings is generally in accordance with specifications. In the past, most weeded twice, and in 1951, all weeded three times. Moreover, the method of retaining seedlings according to local conditions was implemented. The autumn harvest time has also been shortened, reducing the possibility of suffering disasters. When threshing, the past 18 threshing grounds were merged into one, saving a lot of labor, animal power, and farm tools.

On the issue of time for the four tasks of cultivating, sowing, weeding, and harvesting, the agricultural production cooperative has a fundamental advantage over the mutual aid team. During busy farming seasons, in order to strive for "timeliness," mutual aid teams often experience disunity and even division as a result. This is also the most difficult problem for the leadership of mutual aid teams. However, the problem of households competing for time no longer exists in agricultural production cooperatives due to the implementation of unified management and timely cultivation.

In addition, another advantage in cultivation is that the agricultural production cooperative has established a small agricultural experiment field. This experiment field has 1.4 mu of land, and in 1951, it conducted experiments on ten kinds of crops, laying a good foundation for seed selection in 1952.

III. The Lives of Members Have Been Significantly Improved

The lives of the members have undergone great changes in the past year.

In terms of net income: the average net income (including private plots, excluding public accumulation funds) per person in the cooperative in 1951 for seven months was 487,500 yuan, and the average net income per person in 1950 for the whole year was 351,000 yuan. The former was 38.7% more than the latter. The highest income exceeded the income of 1950 by one time. If 1951 is calculated for the whole year, the proportion will be even greater. In 1951, the average net income per person for seven months in the good mutual aid team in the same village was 353,900 yuan, and the average net income per person in the agricultural production cooperative was 37% more than the mutual aid team; in 1951, the average net income per person in the strongest individual household in the same village was 330,000 yuan, and the average net income per person in the agricultural production cooperative was 47.5% more than the individual household.

Due to the increase in income, the members' lives have undergone the following changes: each household has stored half a year's worth of coal. The fuel problem is an extremely serious problem in the entire Pingshun County. Farmers usually have to go to the mountains to cut firewood every day for fuel, which is a huge burden on farmers' lives. Coal is the best fuel, and in the past, ordinary farmers could only use 100 to 200 jin of coal during the New Year. Now, members have stored half a year's worth of coal per household, which is something that mutual aid team members and individual farmers cannot do. Most members of the cooperative have prepared a set of cloth clothes for the New Year, and the children have prepared printed cloth. All households in the cooperative now have a total of four felts, four quilts, two thread blankets, and one mattress. In terms of eating, there is more fine grain than in the past, and there are more varieties of food. In 1950, salt was only eaten in two out of three meals a day. After the autumn harvest in 1951, salt was eaten in all three meals, and there were pickles. In the past, vinegar was only eaten during the New Year and holidays. In 1951, vinegar was eaten at ordinary times. The members have universally lit kerosene lamps and improved their food with the remaining sesame oil. More people are building houses. In 1951, two families built four rooms, and two families are preparing to build houses in the spring of 1952. One family plastered the ceiling.

Due to the significant improvement in their lives, the members love the agricultural production cooperative. The mother of young Guo Gemeo, whose father had just died, said to Guo Gemeo: "Child! You must work hard in the cooperative! You must obey the leadership. Since we have joined the cooperative, we have a backer; in the past, we could catch three corns in one hand, but now we need two hands to catch one!"

Among the 18 member households, 17 had surplus grain in 1951, while only 6 had surplus grain in 1950. Among the households with surplus grain in 1951, the surplus was 6 to 7 shi for those with more, and 3 to 4 shi for those with less.

IV. The Socialist Economic Components in the Cooperative Have Increased Significantly

The agricultural production cooperative of Chuandi Village has implemented a distribution method mainly based on socialist principles. Among the net agricultural income, labor remuneration accounts for 52%, land remuneration accounts for 40%, and public accumulation funds account for 8%. Labor remuneration is calculated on the basis of "labor points," with every ten points being one "workday." When the quantity and quality of labor do not meet the standard of a "workday," a score of less than ten points is calculated; if it exceeds the standard, a score of more than ten points is given. If there is special technology or particularly heavy labor, one "workday" is often counted as 12 or 13 points. Agricultural labor and sideline labor are both calculated in "points." The "point" counting method adopts the "work ticket system." "Work tickets" are issued once a day and settled on average every ten days. The "work tickets" are distributed by the team leader, and the team leader's "work tickets" are issued by the deputy team leader. According to the summary of the seven months in 1951, the remuneration for each "workday" was 14 jin of grain. The wages of the mutual aid team and general hired workers in this village are 7 jin of grain (that is, 5 jin of rice) per day, which is half less than the agricultural production cooperative.

The distribution method of land remuneration is to first evaluate the yield of the land joining the cooperative according to the annual actual income. 40% of the total agricultural income of the cooperative after deducting all agricultural production investments is used as land remuneration. When distributing, the total remuneration amount of the land is divided equally by the total evaluation output of the land joining the cooperative, and then multiplied by the evaluation output of the land joining the cooperative of each household, which is the amount of land remuneration that each household should receive.

The net income from sideline occupations, except for the public accumulation fund, is combined with the part distributed according to labor in the net agricultural income, and all is distributed according to "workdays."

The public accumulation fund is set at 8%. The distribution method is to extract 8% from the net agricultural and sideline income. The use of public accumulation funds is stipulated by this cooperative: the investment in production cannot be less than 60%, and the rest is used for the public welfare undertakings and cultural and educational undertakings of the members.

According to the distribution situation of this cooperative in 1951, labor remuneration accounts for 62.5% of the total net income of agriculture and agricultural sideline occupations; land remuneration accounts for 29.5%. The total of labor remuneration and public accumulation funds accounts for 70.5% of the total net income.

The increase in socialist economic components is also reflected in the increase in public means of production in the cooperative. This cooperative has newly added public means of production, including three large yellow cattle, two iron-wheeled carts, forty-five sheep, eight farm tools, five large saws, and forty-five jin of hemp rope. The whole cooperative has afforested about 30 mu, mainly elm, locust, ailanthus, peach, and apricot. The continuous increase of public property, especially public means of production, is an important factor in consolidating and developing agricultural production cooperatives.

    川底村的农业生产合作社
    范长江
    一、川底村的一般情况及当地
    农民的基本要求
    为了研究农业生产合作社这个新问题，我于一九五一年十二月十一日到山西平顺县的川底村，调查这个村的农业生产合作社。参加这次调查的，有中共平顺县县委书记李先唐、县委秘书李玉贤等。调查时，曾先和这个村的中共支部书记、党员骨干，亦即农业生产合作社的社长、组长等骨干分子座谈，然后和全体社员座谈，然后和这个村尚未组织农业生产合作社的八个互助组组长或代表座谈，然后约八户过去曾与现在的农业生产合作社的社员们同在一个互助组、但在一九五一年春天对农业生产合作社抱怀疑态度、因而未参加农业生产合作社的农民座谈，最后约社员中五个妇女代表座谈。
    川底村是一个有代表性的华北老解放区的山区村庄。它位于太行山区中，耕地很少，又缺水，人畜饮水问题也靠窖水解决，生产条件比较困难。现在全行政村共有九十四户，三百六十六人，七百二十四亩地。全村早已中农化，共有中农九十三户（其中旧中农九户），另外一户生活较差的，是过去被斗争过的旧富农。全村党员二十九人，团员十四人。一九五一年四月组织农业生产合作社前，全村已有十个互助组，共包括八十八户，即是说，绝大部分农民在不同程度上已经用互助组的形式组织起来了。一九五一年春，两个互助组合并起来组成农业生产合作社后，还有八个互助组，包括七十户。这个村的互助运动开始于一九四三年，一直没有停止过。全村农业生产在一九五零年平均已超过战前水平百分之五十。战前每亩平均产粮二百一十斤（一石四斗），一九五零年每亩平均产粮三百一十六斤半（二石一斗一升）。一九五零年全村共有耕畜五十八头，羊二百零一只；一九四三年时，耕畜不足二十头，羊只有三、四十只。在一九五零年十一月山西省劳动模范大会上评选的十一个全省生产模范村中，川底村与同县李顺达的西沟村、杨峰山的斜道坡村同被评为生产模范村。全村现在已有若干公共财产，计：（一）农具：五寸步犁三张，铡草机
    一架，温度表两个，小型玉米脱粒机一个，喷雾器三个，旧式耧五个；（二）房屋及其他设备：房二间，窑五孔，水池三个，水井十五眼，碾九盘，磨
    五盘，板凳十九条，桌二十四张；（三）公有山林
    四、五百亩，小树约三十万株（主要是松、柏、
    桃、杏）。
    在文化教育方面，有小学，民校，图书馆各一所，图书馆内有书四百四十本，订有时事手册、宣传手册五份，人民日报一份，山西日报二份，山西农民报若干份，山西青年报一份。全村并有许多黑板报；每晚都有口头广播。
    川底村现在最受群众尊重和向往的是农业生产合作社。这是中共山西长治地委所试办的十个农业生产合作社之一，在一九五一年四月成立时，有十八户，七十六人，内二十一个全劳动力，十六个妇女劳动力。全村的党员骨干分子大部入了社。全社有地一百五十二亩七分，入社地共一百零七亩，社员自留地共四十五亩七分，其中在一九五一年实际由社内统一经营的是九十二亩（有十五亩麦地系一九五零年秋季下种，一九五一年仍由原种户收割）。这个合作社是由两个互助组合并成的，一个是郭玉恩互助组，一个是郭小有互助组。郭玉恩互助组成立于一九四三年，那时耕畜只有三头，羊只有七只，
    一九四四年当选太行区二等模范互助组；一九四六年因组员增至二十四户，分出十二户，另组郭小有互助组。郭玉恩互助组在一九五零年的平均产量，每亩三百四十二斤（二石二斗八升），超过战前百分之六十三，到一九五零年，耕畜增加到八头，羊四十三只。在一九五零年，郭玉恩组已有公积金粮食一千二百四十五斤（八石三斗），公有旧式农具十五件；郭小有组已有公有旧式农具十九件（尚无公积金）。组织生产合作社前，两组共有二十六户，组社时退出了八户。
    此外八个互助组的简单情况是：户数最多者十三户，最少者四户；平均每组有六、七件公有旧式农具，其中有一组有公有母马一匹。
    调查时，我们首先注意研究了川底村农民的基本要求。所谓“贫雇路线”的倾向在一九四八年被纠正后，从一九四九年起，川底村农民最基本的要求，是在原有的互助组的基础上，扩大再生产。但是，互助组的组织形式，已基本上不能满足农民进一步发展生产的需要。从一九四三年到一九四八年六年期间，互助组对于农民的生产，曾起了很大作用，关键是解决了劳畜力困难，其次是解决了若干农业生产上的技术问题（如浸种、选种、换种、推广金皇后玉茭、大垅谷、两脚耧等）。但是，一九四八年后，劳力畜力的困难一般地解决了。上述技术改进也一般能实行了。农民生活中“糠菜半年粮”的时代，基本上已经过去了。这个时候，这个村的农民在生产上主要有下面这样一些要求：第一、是深耕，但畜力不够，要买好牲畜，单个农户没有资本；第二、是增加肥料，但买不起羊群（当地农民主要用羊的粪便作肥料）；第三、由于互助组集体劳动的结果，劳动力有剩余，但不能有计划地使用这些剩余劳动力于副业生产，因为每个人必须照顾自己的一小块土地；第四、农民已不满足原来的土地使用方法，因为土地太分散，而且不能因地制宜地实行种植，只能按照自己小家庭的生活需要，在十分不经济的条件下进行生产；第五、买不起较大较好的农具；第六、对于较大的土地加工，无法进行。但是，互助组这样的经济组织却不能根本解决上述的问题。因而互助组普遍发生涣散的现象。连郭玉恩那样比较进步的互助组，虽然比当地一般互助组好一些，但是照郭玉恩自己的说法：“也形式主义化了。”正如互助组组员李喜存所说：“互助组就是这个样了，永远也提不高了。”在一九五零年二月，中共山西省委提出了“组织起来和提高技术相结合”的方针，曾对那时开始涣散的一般互助组的提高和巩固，起了显著作用。但如果把“组织起来”仅仅限于“互助组”这样的形式，而不包含更高级的形式，还是不能满足农民的要求的。就川底村来说，在互助组的基础上可能采取的技术，大部分都采用过了。在这种情况下，农民看不见走“组织起来”的道路可以更进一步发展生产的前途，因而自发地走单独发展生产的道路。他们对于现在的经济状况发生了自满情绪和自以为可以自己独立发展的情绪。他们说：“早起圪塔地蔓（即玉茭饼和山药蛋），晌午老瓜闷饭（老瓜即南瓜），黑夜豆面稀饭，行了。”但是，在新民主主义制度下，农民单独发展的道路是很小而且很短的，这一方面并没有什么光明的前途。在政治上，当地农民从一九四九年起滋长了“革命成功”的思想，失去了敌情观念，他们以为地主阶级、日本帝国主义和国民党反动统治被打倒后，已经没有敌人了。因而对参军冷淡起来，对于缴纳公粮等很不热心，对于工作干部也疏远起来，干部到村上派饭吃已经很勉强了。这是农村工作松懈，农民和农村干部都感到十分苦闷的时期。一九五零年冬季开始的抗美援朝爱国主义运动，和继之而起的镇压反革命运动，树立了农民新的敌情观念，鼓起了农民新的战斗意志。在经济上，从一九五一年四月中共长治地委根据中共山西省委的决定试办农业生产合作社之后，川底村农民才又发现了走组织起来的路以进一步发展生产的广大前途。在这个合作社筹备试办时，村里个别主要干部最初还有些犹豫；而互助组的绝大部分组员们，则对农业生产合作社表示了热烈拥护的态度，正反映了农民要求进一步发展生产的情况。
    二、农业生产合作社显著地提
    高了农民的生产力，满足
    了农民进一步扩大再生产
    的要求
    根据一九五一年四月至十月七个月来的总结，川底村农业生产合作社在生产上获得了远超过互助组的巨大的成绩。这个成绩表现在三方面：农业方面，副业方面，扩大生产投资方面。
    首先，在农业方面：单位面积产量是大大地提高了。农业生产合作社，一九五一年每亩平均产量是四百五十四斤（三石零二升六合），比一九五零年每亩多产一百一十二斤（七斗四升六合），即比一九五零年增产百分之三十二点七，比一九五零年川底村的好互助组郭海北组的平均产量三百八十一斤
    （二石五斗四升）超过百分之十九点四，比同年川底村的强单干户郭天福的平均产量三百一十五斤
    （二石一斗）超过百分之四十四，比战前多产二百四十四斤（一石六斗二升六合），即增产百分之一百一十六。农业生产合作社的最高产量，每亩产金皇后玉茭一千零五十斤，比互助组最高产量每亩六百十五斤多产百分之七十一，比单干户最高产量每亩五百二十五斤多产一倍。
    农业劳动生产率提高了。一九五零年互助组每亩地十八个工，一九五一年十四个工，每亩所用劳力的劳动生产率提高了百分之二十二点二，而且耕种质量比过去都好。
    耕地面积也扩大了。由于取消了同一平面上社员土地间的七条土垅，因而取消了二十八个地角，扩大面积半亩，省工四十五个。不过，为了保障土地私有权，经过社员公议，在合并地的地下埋了地界。
    其次，在副业方面：七个月，共生产粗粮一万零二百五十斤，比一九五零年两个互助组副业生产二千一百斤粮，多生产百分之三百八十八，占全社农业收入的百分之二十八，占全村副业收入的百分之三十。一九五一年从事于副业生产的主要是八个整劳动力，主要副业是木工。
    第三，在扩大农副业生产投资方面：七个月已投资于扩大再生产粗粮一万三千二百八十斤。此外，还有公积金粮三千五百三十二斤，即将大部投入扩大再生产。
    农业生产合作社之所以能够显著地提高农民的生产力，是因为它有下述各方面的优越性：
    第一、在土地问题上，农业生产合作社在农民土地私有的基础上空前地解决了全社土地在统一经营的原则下合理使用的问题。农民第一次从“吃甚种甚”的被动的生产情况转为“宜甚种甚”的主动局面。这就大大地发挥了土地的生产效力。其次，对土地普遍进行了加工，逐步进行了土地的基本建设。这个合作社计划在一九五一年冬一九五二年春，把十一亩坡地改为梯田，并把二十一亩凹凸地修成平地。
    第二、在劳力问题上，有了很大的变化。首先是社员的劳动积极性空前提高了。社员每天都要求分配工作，没有工作时就感到不满，而且不愿休息，原来的懒汉也不懒了。原来互助组中零星的剩余劳动力现在集中了，并且扩大了剩余劳动力，为有计划地使用剩余劳动力于副业生产创造了条件。这个合作社一九五一年共集中了八个剩余劳动力长年从事副业生产，一九五二年计划把剩余劳动力使用在副业和土地基本建设两个方面。各个社员在劳动上的特长，现在可以实行合理的分工了。全社共分三个组（两个农业组，一个副业组），每组中又有具体分工。如：有木工技术的，从事副业；在农业生产上，长于犁地的负责犁地，长于播种的负责播种，长于养牲口的负责养牲口，技术经验丰富的担任技术指导，力气大的多作重活，力气小的多作轻活，妇女的劳动积极性也充分发动了。这个社一九五一年共有十六个妇女从事农业主要劳动，有七个老年妇女从事于打场等次要劳动。在七个月内，妇女共作了三百个“劳动日”，最多的做了三十四个
    “劳动日”，一般的二十来个“劳动日”。妇女和男子同工同酬。妇女也按身体强弱、特长，有适当的分工。在家庭劳动上，过去一向由男人负责的挑水等重活，现在许多妇女都负担起来了。
    至于耕畜使用问题，这个合作社现在用折工资的办法；将来打算一律入社。现在在这方面还没有发生过什么争论。
    第三、在肥料问题上，也有了下述的变化。首先，用作价投资的方法集中了全社大部分的肥料，计九千零一十六担。社的羊群、牲口共积肥一千九百余担，增加了肥料来源。因而施肥增加。一九五一年每亩平均施肥九十八担，比一九五零年平均每亩超过十三担，即百分之十五强，比同村好的互助组每亩超过二十三担，即百分之三十强。比同村单干户每亩超过四十担，即百分之六十九。社地每亩最高施肥量是一百二十三担。由于土地统一经营，肥料集中使用，可以因地施肥。如红土上绿肥，黄黑土上人粪、羊粪，白土上骡马粪；背阴地上人粪、羊粪、油饼肥，朝阳地上牛粪、猪粪等。在往地里送肥料时，则可以就近运送。如村北头的粪，即运到村北面的地里；村南头的粪，即运到村南面的地里。因此省工五十四个。一九五二年，这个合作社的羊群将要就地卧肥，省工将更多。
    第四、在耕种技术上，也有很大的改进。最显著的变化，是普遍使用了新式农具，克服了某些社员的保守思想。他们已作到普遍深耕、多耕。过去一般耕深三寸，一九五一年一律耕深四寸。过去有的耕三遍，多数耕两遍，一九五一年一律耕三遍。过去由于劳畜力分散使用，秋收和秋耕不能及时结合，地力不能早日恢复。有些土地在地冻前还来不及耕完，要第二年春天才能开始耕种；现在已能作到及时秋耕。他们普遍采用了优良品种，并统一用进步方法，实行药剂拌种。锄地遍数也加多了，留苗普遍合乎规格。过去多数锄两遍，一九五一年普遍锄三遍。而且实行了因地留苗的办法。秋收时间也缩短了，减少了遭受灾害的可能性。打场时，把过去的十八个场合并为一个场，节省了大量劳力畜力和农具。
    在耕地、播种、锄苗、收获四项工作的时间问题上，农业生产合作社比互助组，有根本性质的优越性。在农忙时，为了争取“及时”，互助组往往因此发生不团结甚至分裂的现象。这也是互助组领导上一个最感困难的问题。但是，农业生产合作社由于实行了统一经营、及时耕作，各户争夺时间的问题，已不复存在。
    此外，在耕种问题上的另一个优点，是农业生产合作社设立了小型的农事实验场。这个实验场有一亩四分地，一九五一年曾作了十种作物试验，为一九五二年选种打下了良好基础。
    三、社员的生活显著提高
    社员的生活一年来有了很大的变化。
    在纯收入方面：全社人口每人一九五一年七个月平均纯收入（包括自留地，除去公积金）为四十八万七千五百元，一九五零年全年每人平均纯收入为三十五万一千元，前者比后者多百分之三十八点七，其中最高者超过一九五零年收入的一倍。如果一九五一年以全年计的话，比例还要大一些。一九五一年同村的好互助组每人平均七个月纯收入为三十五万三千九百元，农业生产合作社每人平均比互助组多百分之三十七；一九五一年同村最强单干户每人平均纯收入为三十三万元，农业生产合作社每人平均比单干户多百分之四十七点五。
    由于收入的增加，社员的生活有了这样一些变化：每户都存了半年煤。燃料问题，在整个平顺县是一个极端严重的问题，农民平时每天都要上山割柴作燃料，这是农民生活上一个巨大的负担。煤是最上等的燃料，过去普通农民只能在过年时用上一、二百斤煤。现在社员每户存半年煤，是互助组员和单干农民办不到的。全社多数社员都准备了一身过年的市布衣服，小孩都准备了花布。全社各户现共添置四条毡子、四条被子、两条线毯、一条褥子。在吃的方面，细粮比过去多了，饭的花样也多了。一九五零年每天三顿饭只有两顿吃盐，一九五一年秋收后，三顿都吃盐了，而且都有了咸菜。过去过年过节才吃醋，一九五一年平时都吃醋了。社员已普遍地点煤油灯，把剩下的麻油改善了伙食。盖房的人也多起来，一九五一年有两家盖了四间房，还有两家准备一九五二年春盖房，有一家糊了顶棚。
    由于生活的显著改善，社员们都热爱着农业生产合作社。新死了父亲的青年郭圪毛的母亲，对郭圪毛说：“孩儿啦！你在社里可得好好干呀！要好好服从领导。咱们入了社，就有了靠山；过去咱的玉茭一只手捉三个，现在两只手才能捉一个呀！”
    十八户社员中，十七户一九五一年都有余粮，一九五零年只有六户有余粮。一九五一年余粮户中，余粮多的六、七石，少的也有三、四石。
    四、社内社会主义经济成份
    显著增加
    川底村农业生产合作社实行了以社会主义原则为主的分配方法。农业纯收入中，劳动的报酬占百分之五十二，土地的报酬占百分之四十，公积金占百分之八。劳动报酬以“劳动分”为计算基础，每十分为一个“劳动日”。劳动的数量和质量不够一个
    “劳动日”的标准时，计十分以下的分数；超过标准的就给予十分以上的分数。如有特殊技术或从事特别繁重的劳动时，一个“劳动日”往往计十二、三分。农业劳动和副业劳动都按“分”计算。计
    “分”方法，采用“工票制”。“工票”每天发给一次，平均每十天结算一次。“工票”由组长负责分发，组长的“工票”由副组长发。根据一九五一年七个月的总结，每个“劳动日”报酬为十四斤粮。这个村的互助组和一般雇工的工资每天是七斤粮（即五斤米），比农业生产合作社少一半。
    土地报酬的分配方法，是先把入社土地按常年实收评定产量。全社农业总收入扣除全部农业生产投资后的百分之四十作为土地报酬。分配时，用全社入社土地的评定产量的总和平分土地报酬总额，再乘以各户入社土地的评定产量，即得各户应得的土地报酬额。
    副业纯收入，除公积金外，与农业纯收入中按劳分配部分合并，全部按“劳动日”分配。
    公积金定为百分之八。分配方法是从农业、副业纯收入中各提出百分之八。公积金的使用方法，这个合作社规定：生产投资不能低于百分之六十，其他用于社员公益事业和文化教育事业。
    按照这个合作社一九五一年分配的情况，劳动报酬占农业及农副业总纯收入的百分之六十二点五；土地报酬占百分之二十九点五。劳动报酬和公积金合计，共占总纯收入的百分之七十点五。
    社会主义经济成份的增加，还表现在社内公有生产资料的增加上。这个合作社新添公有生产资料，计有大黄牛三条、铁轮车两辆、羊四十五只、农具八件、大锯五条、麻绳四十五斤。全社合作造林约三十亩，其中主要是榆、槐、椿、桃、杏。公共财产，特别是公有生产资料的不断增加，是巩固和发展农业生产合作社的一个重要因素。
