    How the Beijing Municipal Industrial and Mining Enterprise Party Committee Developed a Propaganda Network in the Anti-Corruption Campaign
    Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
    The mass propaganda work in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Beijing's industrial and mining enterprises was on a very large scale, just like the propaganda work in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement. In the course of the work, forces from all sides were widely mobilized. The temporary propaganda team of the Tram Company had 554 members, accounting for one-quarter of the total number of Tram Company employees. More than 400 activists from the Telecommunications Bureau participated in the anti-corruption propaganda work, an average of one in six employees. Based on this situation, the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee notified the Party committees of all industrial and mining enterprises to develop the Party's propaganda network in a timely manner in accordance with the conditions stipulated by the Central Committee, shortly after the start of the anti-corruption movement. During the anti-corruption movement, the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department also inspected the plans of various units to develop the propaganda network and the situation of its development. According to preliminary statistics, by the end of February, nine units had developed 325 propagandists, and fourteen units had made plans to continue developing the propaganda network, preparing to absorb 745 outstanding propaganda activists as propagandists. According to the current situation, it is estimated that at least 1,000 to 1,500 propagandists can be developed by the end of the anti-corruption movement. This number is equivalent to three-quarters of the total number of propagandists in industrial and mining enterprises before the anti-corruption movement.
    Among these newly developed propagandists and propaganda activists, there are many excellent propaganda experts. They are not only able to speak, write, and draw well, but more importantly, they are active in their work and good at collecting and studying the masses' thoughts, exposing the enemy's tricks in a timely manner to educate the masses and organize them to fight against corrupt elements.
    Qi Kuanpei, a worker from the Tram Company, and several other workers have created more than 200 cartoons from the beginning of the anti-corruption movement to the present. At the end of 1950, the company lost three valuable vacuum tubes. After the start of the anti-corruption movement, they drew a cartoon called "Vacuum Tubes Complain," and widely spread the word among the masses: "Three vacuum tubes can be assembled into a short-wave transceiver, which can be used to do many beneficial things in our hands; but once it falls into the hands of the enemy, it can be used as a tool for the enemy to do evil." As a result, many people attached importance to this matter, and some even took the initiative to search for clues from all sides. In the end, the thief was forced to confess to stealing the vacuum tubes.
    After the "tiger hunt" battles in the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau's Engineering Section were won three times in a row, Wang Baokun and Li Zhenming, staff members of the section, organized the masses to send a "war letter" to the big corrupt elements who had been proven to have solid evidence but refused to confess, in order to further encourage the masses' fighting enthusiasm. They expressed their determination to fight to the end, and the masses signed the "war letter" with great enthusiasm. They also formulated discipline and each took on a practical task of "tiger hunting."
    Many newly developed propagandists or propaganda activists are hardworking, persistent in their work, and very enthusiastic. Wang Guoxiang, a worker at the People's Printing Factory, became ill from overwork. When the leaders asked him to rest, he said, "I have to go to propaganda even if I have to crawl. I can rest, but the anti-corruption movement can't rest, and the ears of the masses can't rest!" Under his influence, many propaganda workers have improved their work enthusiasm.
    Many newly developed propagandists and original propagandists have created many new propaganda methods and forms, such as: "Step by Step Tightly" (timely exposing the corrupt elements' every move), "Net of Heaven and Earth" (using propaganda methods to create an environment where pressure is exerted on corrupt elements everywhere), "Good News of Tiger Hunting," "Democracy Wall," "Mobile Propaganda Board," "Broadcast Loudspeaker Station," "Confession of赃物," "Literary and Art Station," and so on.
    These facts prove that this batch of newly developed propagandists has added great strength to the Party's propaganda work.
    In the anti-corruption movement, on the one hand, some old propagandists who were affected by the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie and had degenerated politically were cleared out; on the other hand, this batch of new forces was absorbed to participate in the Party's propaganda team, so that the Party's propaganda team was rectified and strengthened in the anti-corruption movement, which was completely necessary.
    In this development of propagandists, the Party's leadership was also particularly strengthened; the Party committees of various industrial and mining enterprises formulated plans for the development of the propaganda network in advance, and cultivated the propaganda activists during the anti-corruption movement. This is the basic reason for the rapid development of the Party's propaganda network.
    Before developing propagandists, the Party Committee of the People's Printing Factory proposed to use the methods of "finding targets" and "self-registration" to absorb a large number of activists to participate in propaganda work and cultivate them. In order to enable each propagandist to undertake the task of cultivating activists, the propagandists reported their own numbers and each brought several "propaganda apprentices."
    After determining the training targets, the Postal Bureau General Branch often used the following three methods to educate them: (1) absorbing them to participate in propagandists' meetings; (2) often assigning them work and imparting key points of propaganda; (3) understanding their individual activities and helping them solve problems in their work.
    According to the experience of various units, the following points should be paid attention to in developing propagandists in a timely manner in the anti-corruption movement: (1) At the beginning of the movement, a large number of activists should be mobilized to participate in propaganda work, organized around the propagandists, assigned certain work, and their role should be fully exerted; (2) Efforts should be made to cultivate and educate them, rapidly improve them in the movement, and train them to become Party propagandists in a planned manner; (3) In accordance with the conditions stipulated by the Central Committee, once the work is mature, they should be developed into propagandists in a timely manner.

    北京市工矿企业党委在反贪污运动中怎样发展宣传网的
    中共北京市委员会宣传部
    北京市工矿企业在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中的群众宣传工作，和抗美援朝运动及镇压反革命运动中的宣传工作一样，规模非常之大。在工作进行中，曾广泛地动员了各方面的力量。电车公司临时组成的宣传队，拥有五百五十四名队员，占电车公司职工总数的四分之一。电信局参加反贪污运动宣传工作的积极分子有四百多人，平均每六个职工中就有一个人参加了宣传工作。根据这种情况，北京市委宣传部在反贪污运动开始不久，就通知各工矿企业党委按照中央所规定的条件及时发展党的宣传网。在反贪污运动进行中，市委宣传部又检查了各单位发展宣传网的计划和发展宣传网的情况。据初步统计，到二月底为止，已有九个单位发展了三百二十五名宣传员，十四个单位做出了继续发展宣传网的计划，准备吸收七百四十五名优秀的宣传工作积极分子做宣传员。按目前情况估计，到反贪污运动结束时，至少可以发展一千到一千五百名宣传员。这个数字相当于反贪污运动前工矿企业宣传员总数的四分之三。
    在这批新发展的宣传员和宣传工作积极分子中，有很多优秀的宣传能手。他们不仅能说、会写、善画，更重要的是工作积极，善于收集和研究群众的思想情况，及时揭露敌人的诡计，以教育群众，组织群众向贪污分子进行斗争。
    电车公司工人齐宽佩和几个工人一起，从反贪污运动开始到现在，已创作了二百多幅漫画。一九五○年底，该公司丢了三只贵重的真空管。反贪污运动开始后，他们就画了一张“真空管诉苦”的漫画，并在群众中做了广泛的口头宣传：“三个真空管可以装配成一个短波的收发报机，在我们手里，它可以用来做很多有益的事情；可是一旦落到敌人手里，它就可以当作敌人为非作恶的工具了。”这一来，使很多人重视了这件事，有的还为此主动地从各方面探寻线索。最后，盗窃分子迫不得已地坦白了偷真空管的事情。
    北京铁路分局工务段职员汪宝昆、李振明，在该段“打虎”战斗连续三次获胜之后，为了进一步鼓舞群众的战斗热情，他们组织群众给已有确实材料证明而死不坦白的大贪污分子下了一封“战书”，表示战斗到底的决心，群众都在“战书”上签名，情绪非常高涨。他们又订出纪律，并且一人分担了一件“打虎”的实际工作。
    有很多新发展的宣传员或宣传工作积极分子吃苦耐劳，坚持工作，热情很高。人民印刷厂工人王国祥因工作太忙，累病了，领导同志让他休息，他说：“我爬着也得去宣传。我休息了，反贪污运动可不能休息呀，群众的耳朵可不能休息呀！”在他的影响下，很多宣传工作者提高了工作积极性。
    有不少新发展的宣传员和原有的宣传员在一起，创造了很多新的宣传方法和宣传形式。如：“步步紧”（及时揭露贪污分子的一举一动）、“天罗地网”（用宣传的方法，造成到处是对贪污分子施行压力的环境）、“打虎捷报”、“民主墙”、“流动宣传牌”、“广播喊话站”、“赃物自述”、“文艺站”等等。
    这些事实证明：这批新发展的宣传员给党的宣传工作增加了很大的力量。
    在反贪污运动中，一方面清除一些受资产阶级腐朽思想的影响、在政治上堕落了的旧宣传员，一方面吸收这批新的力量参加党的宣传队伍，使党的宣传队伍在反贪污运动中进行了整顿，得到了加强，这是完全必要的。
    在这次发展宣传员中，党的领导也特别加强了；各工矿企业的党委在事先订出了发展宣传网的计划，在反贪污运动进行中，又对宣传工作积极分子加以培养。这是使党的宣传网迅速发展的基本原因。
    人民印刷厂党委会在发展宣传员之前，曾提出要用“找对象”和“自动报名”的方法吸收大批积极分子参加宣传工作，并加以培养。为了使每个宣传员都担负起培养积极分子的任务，曾由宣传员自报数字，各带若干“宣传徒弟”。
    邮政局总支在确定培养对象之后，便经常用以下三种方法对他们进行教育：（一）吸收他们参加宣传员的会议；（二）经常给他们布置工作，传授宣传要点；（三）了解他们的个别活动情况，帮助他们解决工作上的问题。
    根据各单位的经验，在反贪污运动中及时发展宣传员，应注意以下几点：（一）运动一开始就要大量发动积极分子参加宣传工作，把他们组织在宣传员的周围，分配他们以一定的工作，充分发挥他们的作用；（二）要抓紧对他们进行培养、教育，在运动中迅速提高他们，有计划地培养他们成为党的宣传员；（三）按照中央所规定的条件，一旦工作成熟，就要及时发展他们为宣传员。
