    The Joy of the Miao People Being Masters of Their Own Affairs
    To the Editor: The Guangxi Provincial People's Government appointed Yang Wengui, a member of the Miao ethnic group, as the Deputy County Magistrate of Sanjiang County at the end of last year.
    The Miao people were very happy to hear this news. They said: "Now, we are the masters of our own affairs. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can our Miao people become county magistrates. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, humph, don't even think about becoming a county magistrate, we wouldn't even dream of stepping into the gate of the township government!" An old man said, "In the past, the Chiang and Bai bandit gangs treated us like beasts of burden. Today, Chairman Mao has come, and we are truly human beings!"
    Comrade Yang Wengui also said, "Today, my appointment as Deputy County Magistrate is not only my personal honor, but also the honor of the Miao people and all ethnic minorities in the country. In the future, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I will definitely contribute all my strength to seek happiness for my ethnic minority compatriots, and also loyally and wholeheartedly serve the people!"

    苗族人民当家作主的喜悦
    编辑同志：广西省人民政府在去年年底任命了苗族人民杨文贵为三江县副县长。
    苗族人民听了这个消息，都十分高兴。他们说：“现在，我们当家作主了。只有在共产党领导下，我们苗人才能作县长。在国民党反动派统治的时候，哼，别说当县长，就是乡公所的大门，我们也休想踏进一步哩！”一位老公公说：“蒋、白匪帮过去把我们当牛作马，今天来了毛主席，我们才真正是一个人啦！”
    杨文贵同志也说：“今天我能当副县长，不只是我个人的光荣，也是苗族人民、全国少数民族的光荣。今后在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我一定贡献出我自己的一切力量，为少数民族同胞谋幸福，也忠诚地全心全意为人民服务！”    蒋特艾
