We Have the Responsibility to Repel the Bourgeoisie's Attacks
Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy

For the past three years, the bourgeoisie has been constantly and rampantly attacking the people's government led by the working class, and this has been most evident in financial and economic work. We can readily cite a few examples:

	I. In January, April, July, and November of 1949, there were four major price surges, the most extensive (nationwide) and longest-lasting of which was in November. Its main cause was the bourgeoisie's planned and rampant attack on the people's government. At that time, they saw a lot of cloth and a shortage of grain in Shanghai, so they used hoarding grain as a means to launch an attack; in Wuhan, they saw a lot of grain and a shortage of cloth, so they used hoarding cloth as a means to launch an attack, which caused price fluctuations. It was not until the government mobilized supplies and made overall arrangements that this attack was repelled.

	II. During the Spring Festival of 1950, the bourgeoisie again stirred up price surges in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan and other places. Grain merchants in Shanghai even wanted to raise the price of rice from 270,000 yuan per shih to 330,000 yuan. When the government did not allow it, the grain merchants refused to supply grain. Fortunately, the government had already mastered a large amount of grain, enough to fully supply the market, and the price of grain was suppressed. However, due to the bourgeoisie's multi-faceted attacks, other prices still fluctuated somewhat.

	III. After the spring of 1950, the national finance was unified, and cash revenue and expenditure as well as material receipts and disbursements were close to balance, ending the twelve years of inflation under the Kuomintang reactionary regime. The market's speculative manipulation power was reduced, and prices turned stable. However, the profit-seeking bourgeoisie changed its tactics and continued to attack from other aspects. For example, industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai and other places withdrew funds and fled abroad, attempting to create an industrial and commercial recession and put all the responsibility on the People's Government.

	IV. In the summer of 1950, in order to adjust public-private relations and reduce the tax burden, the government convened representatives of private enterprises (i.e., the bourgeoisie) to participate in tax conferences and various professional conferences to discuss adjusting tax rules and tax rates, and decided on a "production determined by sales" plan, first supporting the textile and machinery industries. Some bourgeois representatives attending machinery ordering meetings learned of the government's ordering plans and immediately telegraphed Shanghai machinery companies to rush to purchase hardware and materials, which caused a price surge.

	V. Since the government adjusted public-private relations and limited state-owned retail commerce to six items: grain, cloth, cooking oil, edible salt, kerosene, and coal, and supported private enterprises through processing, ordering, purchasing, and loans, private enterprises have gradually improved. In June 1950, the United States imperialist war of aggression against Taiwan and aggression against Korea broke out. The bourgeoisie, in view of the increasing difficulty of overseas shipping, rushed to purchase imported materials and hardware, causing prices to fluctuate again. Fortunately, the government had made early arrangements and was able to suppress them in time. However, the stock of white sugar was relatively small, and the bourgeoisie took advantage of the situation in August, causing the price of sugar to rise sharply, until the government mastered a large amount of white sugar, and the price of sugar began to stabilize. This shows that the bourgeoisie's attack is ubiquitous.

	VI. In the autumn of 1950, when autumn grain came on the market, the purchasing power of farmers in various places after the land reform increased, and industry and commerce generally improved. The bourgeoisie in Shanghai and other places wanted to break away from state-owned leadership and demanded free development. They refused to accept government processing orders, or raised processing fees to seek exorbitant profits. This trend became more and more obvious, and the bourgeoisie even wanted to usurp the leadership of the working class. As for using bribery and other despicable means to corrupt government cadres, evade taxes, cut corners, and steal state assets and economic intelligence in order to achieve the goal of seeking exorbitant profits, it is a well-known fact and need not be repeated.

Based on these facts (although these are only a very small part of the facts of the bourgeoisie's illegal acts), can we say that the bourgeoisie has not launched a rampant attack on the people's government led by the working class? Can we say that the bourgeoisie has not violated the provisions of the Common Program?

The China Association for Promoting Democracy is one of the constituent parts of the people's democratic united front. We are a political party that takes the thought of the working class—Mao Zedong Thought—as our guiding ideology, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, strive for the full realization of the Common Program. Therefore, we must resolutely and thoroughly oppose anything that violates or undermines the Common Program. For the past three years, the bourgeoisie has carried out a rampant attack on the people's government led by the working class, completely destroying the Common Program, which we can never tolerate. All our members have the responsibility to repel the bourgeoisie's attack, and must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely stand at the forefront of the struggle against corruption and theft, otherwise they cannot become members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, nor can they become cadres in the revolutionary camp.

Some people ask: "Is it permissible for bourgeois ideology to exist within democratic parties?" It is undeniable that there are indeed some people within our democratic parties who still have bourgeois ideology, but our democratic parties have all accepted the leadership of the working class, and no matter what aspect they are assigned to, they all have the task of self-reform in order to transform social ideology. Therefore, we must use the thought of the working class—Mao Zedong Thought—as the standard, and must first criticize bourgeois ideology from within, and eliminate all the poisonous effects of reactionary ideas, before we can shoulder the responsibility of transforming society. Therefore, we must use this anti-corruption and anti-theft campaign to criticize bourgeois ideology, transform our own thinking, and move further forward.

The anti-corruption and anti-theft campaign is an acute class struggle, and the bourgeoisie will certainly carry out sabotage and resistance. After being fiercely counterattacked by us, they shouted indiscriminately: "Since national bourgeoisie is allowed to exist, why do you still oppose us?" Some even said: "If you want to oppose bourgeois ideology, you might as well eliminate us." It is true that in today's New Democratic society, we still allow the bourgeoisie to exist, but the bourgeoisie must wholeheartedly accept the leadership of the working class, must abide by the Common Program, and must cooperate with other social and economic components under the leadership of the state-owned economy to promote the development of the entire social economy (as stipulated in Article 26 of the Common Program). At the same time, bourgeois ideology must be transformed, and it must not be allowed to develop freely. Because our goal is to transition from a New Democratic society to a socialist society, bourgeois ideology must not be allowed to remain or develop without being transformed, otherwise our society will not only fail to advance, but will also regress. It must be known that the essence of the bourgeoisie is selfishness and profit-seeking. If they do not accept the ideological leadership of the working class, they will not reform and cannot reform. We now only ask the bourgeoisie to reform themselves well, and do not ask to eliminate them. There is no need to doubt this.

    我们有打退资产阶级进攻的责任
    中国民主促进会副主席　王绍鏊
    三年来，资产阶级不断地猖狂地向工人阶级领导的人民政权进攻，这在财政经济工作方面表现得最为明显了。我们可以信手举几个例子：
    一、一九四九年一、四、七、十一月间，曾经发生四次物价大涨风，其中尤以十一月份这一次涨风，范围最广（遍及全国），时间也最久。它的主要原因，就是资产阶级有计划地向人民政权进行猖狂的进攻。他们当时在上海看到纱布很多，粮食不足，即以囤积粮食为手段，举行进攻；在武汉看到粮食很多，纱布不足，即以囤积纱布为手段，举行进攻，这样，就使物价发生波动。直到政府调集物资，全局布置，才把这种进攻打退。
    二、一九五○年春节，资产阶级又在北京、天津、上海、武汉等地，掀起物价涨风。上海粮商竟欲将米价从每石二十七万元提高到三十三万元，政府不允许，粮商即拒绝供应粮食。好在政府已经掌握了大量的粮食，足够充分供应市场，才将粮价压平。但因资产阶级多方面的进攻，其他物价，仍发生一些波动。
    三、一九五○年春季以后，全国财政统一，现金收支及物资出纳均已接近平衡，结束了国民党反动政权十二年来的通货膨胀，市场的投机操纵力减少，使物价转向平稳。但是唯利是图的资产阶级，乃又变更方式，从其他方面继续进攻，如上海及其他各地工商业家抽提资金，逃避国外，企图造成工商业的萧条，并将这个责任全部推到人民政府身上。
    四、一九五○年夏，政府为了调整公私关系及减轻税负，曾召集私营企业代表（即资产阶级），让他们参加税务会议及各种专业会议，讨论调整税则税率，并决定“以销定产”的计划，首先扶助纺织工业及机器工业，竟有参加机器定货会议的资产阶级代表，探知政府定货计划后，即电嘱上海机器业抢购五金器材，以致引起物价涨风。
    五、自政府调整公私关系并限定国营零售商业为粮食、纱布、食油、食盐、煤油及煤六种，又以加工、定货、收购、贷款等方式，扶助私营企业以后，私营企业遂日趋好转。一九五○年六月，美帝国主义侵占台湾侵略朝鲜的战事发生，资产阶级鉴于海外航运将趋困难，乃抢购进口物资及五金器材，以致物价再起波动，幸政府早有布置，得以及时压平。惟白糖一项，存底较少，八月间资产阶级乘虚而入，以致糖价高涨，直到政府掌握了大批白糖后，糖价始得压平。足见资产阶级的进攻，无孔不入。
    六、一九五○年秋粮登场，各地土地改革后的农民购买力提高，工商业普遍好转。上海等处的资产阶级，即欲脱离国营领导，要求自由发展。对于政府的加工定货，拒不接受；或将工缴费提高，以牟取暴利。这种趋势，往后愈益明显，资产阶级竟欲篡夺工人阶级的领导权。至于以行贿等卑鄙手段来腐蚀政府干部，偷税漏税，偷工减料及盗窃国家资财和经济情报，以求达到牟取暴利的目的，更是众所周知的事实，毋庸赘述。
    根据以上这些事实（虽然，这只是资产阶级犯法行为的极少的一部分事实），我们能说资产阶级没有向工人阶级领导的政权发动猖狂的进攻吗？我们能说资产阶级没有违背共同纲领的规定吗？
    中国民主促进会是人民民主统一战线的组成部分之一。我们是以工人阶级思想——毛泽东思想为领导思想，是在中国共产党领导之下，为争取共同纲领的全部实现而奋斗的政治党派。因此，凡是违背或破坏共同纲领的，我们必须坚决地彻底地加以反对。三年来资产阶级对工人阶级领导的人民政权，进行猖狂的进攻，完全破坏了共同纲领，我们是决不能容忍的。我们全体会员，人人都有打退资产阶级进攻的责任，必须在中国共产党的领导下，坚决地站在反贪污和反盗窃斗争的最前线，否则就不能成为中国民主促进会的会员，也不能成为革命阵营中的干部。
    有人要问：“民主党派内部，可否允许资产阶级的思想存在？”毋庸讳言，在我们民主党派内部，的确还有人存在着资产阶级的思想，但是我们民主党派都是接受了工人阶级领导的，不问它分工在那一方面，都是负有自我改造以改造社会思想的任务的，因此，我们必须以工人阶级思想——毛泽东思想为标准，必须先从内部批判资产阶级的思想，清除一切反动思想的污毒，然后才能够负起改造社会的责任来。因此我们必须通过这次反贪污和反盗窃运动，批判资产阶级的思想，使自己的思想得到改造，更前进一步。
    反贪污和反盗窃运动是一场尖锐的阶级斗争，资产阶级是一定要进行破坏和反抗的，他们在受到我们的猛烈反攻之后，就乱喊说：“既然允许民族资产阶级存在，为什么还要反我们？”甚至说：“要反对资产阶级的思想，不如消灭我们好了。”不错，在今天新民主主义社会里面，我们还允许资产阶级存在，但是资产阶级必须全心全意地接受工人阶级的领导，必须遵守共同纲领，要在国营经济领导之下和其他各种社会经济成分分工合作，以促进整个社会经济的发展（共同纲领第二十六条所规定的就是这样）。同时，资产阶级的思想必须加以改造，不容许其自由发展。因为我们的目标，是由新民主主义社会过渡到社会主义社会，资产阶级的思想，决不能容许停留或发展下去而不加以改造，否则我们的社会，非但不能前进，而且还会倒退。须知资产阶级的本质，是自私自利的，唯利是图的，假使他们不接受工人阶级的思想领导的话，他们是不会改造也不可能改造的。我们现在只要求资产阶级好好改造自己，并不要求消灭他们。这是用不着怀疑的。
