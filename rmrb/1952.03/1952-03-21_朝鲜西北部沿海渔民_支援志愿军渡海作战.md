Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 19th—Fishermen on the northwest coast of Korea are heroically supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers in cross-sea operations and overcoming the impact of ice floes to maintain smooth winter maritime traffic. Last October, when a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers was preparing to attack and annihilate the enemy on an island off the west coast, the local Korean fishermen eagerly signed up with the local Korean government, vying to serve as navigators for the Volunteers. The number of applicants exceeded the required number by more than double. Fifty-seven-year-old boatman An Guangyin said when signing up, "I have been fishing here since I was a child. I know the reefs, hidden reefs, whirlpools, and rapids in this sea like the back of my hand. I can identify every tree and rock on the island with my eyes closed. I guarantee to deliver the Volunteer comrades to the island safely!" These Korean fishermen with rich navigation experience felt very honored to be approved as navigators. Some old boatmen said excitedly, "The friendship between our Chinese and Korean people is just like the old Chinese saying, 'crossing the river in the same boat'." They got up early and went to bed late, preparing for the cross-sea operation together with the soldiers. They also made a "contract for meritorious service" plan with the soldiers to ensure good and stable navigation.
    After the battle began, the Korean navigators guided the assault boats forward rapidly in the turbulent sea. As the boats approached the island, the enemy on the island fired various light and heavy weapons at the assault boats, and the huge waves rolling back from the island shore prevented the boats from approaching the shore quickly. But this was the most critical moment to win the landing victory. Wen Jikun, a Korean navigator on the leading assault boat, stepped forward and shouted to the boatmen, "It's difficult here, let me do it!" He grabbed the helm, and the assault boat immediately turned to avoid the enemy's firepower blockade, rushing to the shore diagonally under a large rock, and the soldiers landed safely. On another assault boat, the old boatman An Guangyin also grabbed the helm at this time, skillfully and cleverly passing through the reef area under the enemy's tight firepower blockade, and quickly sent the soldiers ashore. In this way, the troops successfully seized the beachhead and annihilated the enemy.
    During the period when the sea was frozen, the coastal fishermen drove small boats, cleverly and alertly passing through the ice cracks, traveling between the land and the islands, and helping the troops with transportation work. Once, the sea breeze was strong, and the waves were crashing with ice floes in the ocean, making navigation very dangerous. However, at this time, some important materials urgently needed to be transported to the island. Boatmen Huang Wanyuan, Jin Dongsan, and Jin Xiangming bravely said, "No matter how dangerous it is, we can't delay the comrades' use!" These experienced boatmen pushed the boats into the ocean full of ice floes, navigating the boats cleverly and alertly in the gaps between many ice floes. When they were blocked by ice floes from all sides, they pulled the boats onto the ice surface, slid them over the ice layer, and then pushed them back into the sea to continue moving towards the island. The boatmen's clothes were soaked with seawater and covered with thin ice flakes, but they finally completed the task victoriously. They said, "The Chinese People's Volunteers guarding the island are protecting our peaceful life. As long as the Volunteers need it, no amount of difficulty can stop us!"

    朝鲜西北部沿海渔民
    支援志愿军渡海作战
    【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】朝鲜西北部沿海的渔民们英勇地支援志愿军渡海作战，并战胜冰流的冲击，保持冬季海上交通的畅达。去年十月份，当志愿军某部准备攻歼西海岸某岛上的敌人时，当地朝鲜渔民们个个摩拳擦掌争先恐后地向当地朝鲜政府报名，请求为志愿军当领航员，报名的人数超过需要的一倍以上。五十七岁的老船工安光殷在报名时说：“我自小就在这里打鱼，这片海里的明礁、暗礁、漩涡、急流，岛上的一棵树、一块石，我闭着眼也摸得清，保证把志愿军同志顺利地送上岛去！”当这些有着丰富航海经验的朝鲜渔民们被批准充当领航员以后，他们感到非常荣耀。有的老船工兴奋地说：“我们中朝人民的友谊，正如中国的一句老话所说的，叫做‘同舟共济’。”他们早起晚睡地和战士们一道进行渡海作战的准备工作，他们并和战士们订立了“合同立功”计划，保证领得好、领得稳。
    战斗发起后，朝鲜领航员指引着突击船在波涛滚滚的大海中向前急驶。当船只将要接近海岛时，岛上守敌用各种轻重火器向突击船射击，从岛岸卷回的巨浪使船只不能迅速靠岸。但这正是争取登陆胜利的最紧张时刻，冲在最前列的突击船上的朝鲜领航员文吉坤挺身而出，向船手喊了一声“这儿困难，让我来！”他一把抢过舵杆，突击船立刻扭转身避开敌人的火力封锁，从斜刺里冲到岸边一块大岩石下，战士们便安全地登了陆。在另一只突击船上，领航老船工安光殷也在这时抢过舵杆，在敌人严密的火力封锁下机智熟练地通过了暗礁地带，将战士们迅速送上陆地。这样，部队就顺利地抢占了滩头阵地，歼灭了敌人。
    在海洋封冻期间，沿海的渔民们又驾驶着小船机警灵巧地穿过冰缝，往来在陆地和海岛之间，帮助部队作运输工作。有一次，海风正急，浪潮卷着冰块在海洋里横冲直撞，行船十分危险。但是，这时却有一些重要物资急待运上岛去，船工黄万元、金东三、金相明勇敢地说：“任凭怎么危险也不能耽误同志们用啊！”这些富有经验的船工们把船推进冰块汹涌的海洋，驾着船只在许多冰块的间隙中机警灵巧地航行着。当他们被冰块由四面阻塞住时，他们就把船只拉到冰面上滑过冰层，再推下海去，继续向海岛前进。船工们的衣服都被海水浸透了，并结了薄薄的冰片，但是终于胜利地完成了任务。他们说：“志愿军守卫在海岛上就是保卫我们的和平生活，只要志愿军需要，再大的困难也挡不住我们！”
