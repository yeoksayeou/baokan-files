Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 1st. Korean media unanimously condemned the heinous crimes of the American aggressor bandits in waging bacteriological warfare in Korea, and called on all Korean people to rise up and participate in the battle to eradicate bacteria and prevent epidemics, and resolutely smash the heinous schemes of American imperialism.

The "Labor News" editorial on February 29th pointed out: The fact that the American imperialists are conducting large-scale bacteriological warfare once again shows that they are not only the deadly enemy of the Korean people, but also the deadly enemy of the people of the world. The current major task of the Korean people is to wage a resolute struggle against the American aggressors' bacteriological weapons and promptly eradicate the germs spread by the enemy. The editorial called on labor party organizations at all levels and all party members to give full play to their vanguard role in this struggle and widely mobilize the people in various regions to actively participate in the battle to eradicate bacteria and prevent epidemics.

The "Democratic Korea" editorial on the same day wrote: All peace-loving people and all good people in the world will be angered by this inhuman crime of the American bandits and clearly recognize that American imperialism is a public enemy of mankind. The editorial emphasized: Although the enemy's atrocities of violating international law and spreading bacteria may bring us harm, as long as we mobilize all possible forces and launch a resolute struggle, we can completely shatter the enemy's vicious conspiracy.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The people of Poland, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia angrily protested against the heinous crimes of the American troops invading Korea in using bacteriological weapons. According to a TASS report: The Polish Microbiological Society issued a letter to microbiologists around the world regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by the American troops invading Korea. The letter to microbiologists around the world stated: Polish microbiologists were deeply shocked to learn of the use of bacteriological weapons by the American army, and the Polish people resolutely condemn the United States' crimes of using bacteriological warfare to slaughter people. The Polish Microbiological Society called on American and global microbiologists to face this fact and stop the act of using bacteriological weapons to slaughter people.

The letter to microbiologists around the world continued: "We remind you that the International Congress of Microbiologists in Copenhagen in 1947 passed a resolution, at which time we and you all acknowledged that bacteriological warfare is not permissible. All international conferences held in Poland have pointed out that microbiologists must never stand with those who attempt to turn science into a murder weapon for slaughtering mankind. Under no circumstances do we have reason to violate this extremely lofty goal of our science."

Mass organizations in Bulgaria put forward strong protests against the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea by the American aggressors. The Central Council of the Bulgarian Red Cross sent protest telegrams to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Red Cross Association in Geneva, and the United Nations, saying: "On behalf of the 750,000 members of the Bulgarian Red Cross, we express our strongest protest against the latest barbaric and shameless act of the American interventionists in violating the Geneva Convention—the use of bacteriological weapons against the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The barbaric actions of the American executioners in Korea must be stopped immediately. We firmly demand that you take all measures to implement the Geneva Convention."

The crimes of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons in Korea have also aroused deep anger among the people of Czechoslovakia. Newspapers have published protests from the working people against this barbaric crime of the imperialists. The writer Novi wrote in the "Red Right Newspaper" that he was convinced that the robbers who used bacteriological weapons against the heroic Korean people would be punished.

    【新华社平壤一日电】朝鲜舆论界一致痛斥美国侵略强盗在朝鲜进行细菌战的滔天罪行，并号召全朝鲜人民奋起参加扑灭细菌和防疫的战斗，坚决粉碎美帝国主义的万恶阴谋。
    二月二十九日的“劳动新闻”社论指出：美帝国主义者进行大规模细菌战的事实，又一次表明了它不但是朝鲜人民的死敌，而且是全世界人民的死敌。朝鲜人民目前的重大任务，就是要和美国侵略者的细菌武器作坚决的斗争，及时地扑灭敌人所撒布的病菌。社论号召劳动党各级组织和全体党员在这一斗争中，高度发挥先锋作用，广泛地发动各地人民积极参加扑灭细菌和防疫的战斗。
    同日的“民主朝鲜”社论写道：全世界爱好和平的人民和一切善良的人们，都将为美国强盗的这种丧尽人性的罪行而激怒，并清楚地认识到美帝国主义是人类的公敌。社论强调指出：敌人破坏国际公法、撒布细菌的暴行，虽然可能给我们带来危害，但是只要我们动员一切可能动员的力量，展开坚决的斗争，我们是完全可以粉碎敌人这一毒辣的阴谋的。
    【新华社二日讯】波兰、保加利亚和捷克斯洛伐克三国人民愤怒地抗议侵朝美军使用细菌武器的滔天罪行。据塔斯社消息：波兰微生物学协会就侵朝美军使用细菌武器一事发表告全世界细菌学者书。这个告全世界细菌学者书说：波兰微生物学者获悉美军使用细菌武器的消息，深为震动，波兰人民坚决谴责美国利用细菌战争屠杀人民的罪行。波兰微生物学协会呼吁美国和全世界的细菌学者正视这个事实，并制止用细菌武器屠杀人民的行为。
    告全世界细菌学者书接着说：“我们提醒你们，一九四七年哥本哈根国际微生物学者代表大会曾通过一项决议，当时我们和你们都承认细菌战争是不可允许的。在波兰举行的一切国际性会议都曾经指出：微生物学者决不可和那些企图把科学变成屠杀人类凶器的人们站在一边。任何情况都没有使我们有理由可以违背我们科学的这个极其崇高的目标。”
    保加利亚的群众团体提出了有力的抗议，反对美国侵略者在朝鲜使用细菌武器。保加利亚红十字会中央理事会给红十字国际委员会、日内瓦的红十字会协会以及联合国的抗议电报说：“我们代表保加利亚红十字会七十五万会员，对美国干涉分子最近这一次违反日内瓦公约的野蛮而无耻的行为——对朝鲜人民和中国志愿军使用细菌武器——提出最强烈的抗议。美国刽子手们在朝鲜的野蛮行动必须立刻予以制止。我们坚决要求你们采取一切措施实行日内瓦公约。”
    美国侵略者在朝鲜使用细菌武器的罪行，也激起了捷克斯洛伐克人民的深切愤怒。各报都刊载了劳动人民对帝国主义者这一野蛮罪行的抗议。作家诺维在“红色权利报”撰文表示，他深信对英雄的朝鲜人民使用细菌武器的强盗们一定会受到惩罚。
