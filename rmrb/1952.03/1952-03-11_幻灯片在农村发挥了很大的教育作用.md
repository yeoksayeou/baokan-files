    Slides Play a Great Educational Role in Rural Areas
    To the Editor: The Seventh Complete Primary School of Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, organized a slide projection team to go to the countryside to cooperate with the land reform propaganda work. From the end of last year to the end of February this year, they performed seventeen times, with more than 7,500 audience members, and were warmly welcomed by the peasant masses.
    The content of their propaganda is mostly taken from real people and events in the local land reform work. For example, in response to the pacifist and paralyzed thinking among the masses at the beginning of the land review, they drew pictures of the "changing of the sky" by landlord Pang Wenzhi of Shaoshan Township and pictures of the crimes of bully landlord Shen Shaoyao of Yongyi Township for propaganda. Recently, at the expanded cadre meeting for land review in the fourth and fifth districts of Xiangtan County, it was found that there were fifty-seven kinds of tricks used by landlords to resist land reform, and they were also drawn into pictures. Problems such as the Marriage Law were also drawn into pictures for projection. During the projection, a special person explained, and the explanation was as simple as possible so that the peasants could understand. The pictures were projected one by one, but the speech was continuous, so that the audience's attention was focused on the pictures, which aroused great interest among the audience. These slide pictures aroused the class hatred of the peasants and raised their vigilance. When Pang Wenzhi's "changing of the sky" picture was shown in Tiepi Village, Shaoshan, when the picture of Pang Wenzhi distributing property was shown, three peasants shouted loudly in the crowd: "There is also a copper stove buried in the ashes!" When all the slides were finished, the masses shouted slogans with extremely hateful emotions: "Eliminate the landlord class!" When the pictures of the crimes of bully landlord Shen Shaoyao were shown in Yongyi Township, some victims added angrily in the crowd: "He also injured my mother-in-law." Some said: "Add the landlord holding secret meetings." The atmosphere at the meeting was very激昂. Before the Marriage Law picture was shown, a woman named Shen Xiuzhen in Yongyi Township, because she was not satisfied with her arranged marriage, asked the village chief to divorce, but the village chief refused. She heard that the slide projection team was going to show the "Marriage Law", so she rushed to the meeting place early to see it. After seeing it, she went to the village chief and said: "You don't understand the Marriage Law, why don't you go to the 'soil film' to learn. I have sufficient reasons for divorce, if you don't allow me to divorce, I will go to the district government." She went to the district government and the court to request a divorce without any scruples. Some men who liked to beat their wives were also educated after watching this slide film, and knew that they could no longer oppress women. Some women who liked to beat their children, after watching the "Children's Happiness" film, also knew that it was not good to beat children. Slides have such a great propaganda role in the countryside, and I hope that they can be widely promoted.

    幻灯片在农村发挥了很大的教育作用
    编辑同志：湖南省湘潭县立第七完全小学组织了一个幻灯队，下乡配合土地改革进行宣传工作。他们在去年年终到今年二月底，演出十七次，观众有七千五百多人，得到了农民群众的热烈欢迎。
    他们宣传的内容，多取材于当地土地改革工作中的真人真事。如针对土地复查刚开始时群众中的太平麻痹思想，他们画了韶山乡地主庞文质的“变天”图片，和永义乡的恶霸地主沈少尧的罪恶图片，进行宣传。最近湘潭县第四、五区土地覆查扩大干部会议上，查出地主反抗土地改革的花样有五十七种，他们也画成图片。像婚姻法等问题，也画了图片放映。在放映时，有专人讲解，讲解时尽量通俗，使农民听懂。图片是一张张的放映，但说话是连续讲，使观众的注意力集中在图片上，引起观众很大兴趣。这些幻灯图片激发了农民的阶级仇恨，提高了他们的警惕性。在韶山铁皮村放映庞文质的“变天”图，放映到庞文质分散财物的图片时，有三个农民在人群中高声喊着：“还埋了一个铜炉锅在灰里呢！”当全部幻灯片放完时，群众以极其愤恨的情绪高呼口号：“消灭地主阶级！”在永义乡放映恶霸地主沈少尧的罪恶图片时，有的被害人在人群里愤恨地补充着：“他还打伤我的岳母。”有的说：“还要添上一个地主开私会。”会场的情绪很激昂。放映婚姻法图片前，永义乡有个妇女沈秀贞因为不满意自己的包办婚姻，曾向村长提出要求离婚，村长不准。她听说幻灯放映队要放映“婚姻法”，很早就赶到会场来看，看后她去找村长说：“你不懂得婚姻法，还不去看土电影学学，我离婚有十足理由，你不准我离婚，我到区政府去。”她毫无顾虑地去区政府、法院请求离婚。有的男人爱打老婆，看了这个幻灯片后，也受到了教育，知道再不能压迫妇女。有的妇女爱打孩子，看了“儿童幸福”的片子后，也知道打小孩子是不好的。幻灯片在乡村的宣传作用这样大，希望能够大量推广。
