    A Salute to the People of the Motherland
    Wang Bingzhong, Principal of the Chinese People's School in Fangxian County, Guicheng Prefecture, Korea
    I work in a Chinese primary school in Guicheng County, Ping'an North Province, Korea. In November 1950, our school was completely burned down by American imperialist planes. We persisted in teaching despite the difficulties. Since the arrival of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, they have always visited our school, whether stationed locally or passing through, to ask about our studies and living conditions. If they had books or picture albums, they would always leave us a few. In this way, our school has now received more than 100 books and picture albums. These books not only help our next generation understand the greatness of our motherland and the brilliance of our leader Chairman Mao, but also provide our teachers and local overseas Chinese with valuable spiritual nourishment.
    The volunteer comrades not only love the overseas Chinese students in Korea, but also give the same help to all Korean children. The comrades of the Second Battalion of a certain unit stationed locally sent people to visit our school as soon as they arrived. When they learned that Korean students lacked stationery, the comrades of the entire battalion demonstrated a great spirit of internationalism and launched a donation campaign. Some comrades donated towels and socks, some took out pens, and some heroes donated their glorious prizes, such as handbooks. In addition to goods, they also donated 12 million yuan in Renminbi to buy 1,200 dozen pencils and 3,000 exercise books in the motherland, which were distributed to 13,000 primary and middle school students in the entire county; they also bought a batch of pens and distributed them to the children of military families and martyrs of the Korean People's Army.
    At the donation acceptance meeting, the head of the education section of Guicheng County said: "The Chinese People's Volunteers not only helped our Korean people defeat the American imperialist aggressors, but also care about our schools and students so much. All levels of schools in our county will hold a 'Korea-China Friendship Week' to learn from the great internationalist spirit of the Chinese people." A student representative from Korea said: "We are so happy and grateful to receive so many things from the Chinese People's Volunteer uncles that words cannot express it. We can only study hard, strengthen unity, support the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and eliminate the American aggressors and the Li Chengwan puppet army as soon as possible." After the meeting, all the teachers in the county, led by the head of the education section, entrusted me to extend our highest respect to the people of our motherland.

    向祖国人民致敬
    朝鲜龟城郡方岘中国人人民学校校长
    王秉忠
    我在朝鲜平安北道龟城郡的一个华侨小学工作。一九五○年十一月，我校被美帝国主义的飞机全部烧毁。我们在困难中坚持着教学。自从咱们中国人民志愿军来到朝鲜以后，他们不论是在本地驻扎或路过时，总是找到我们学校来看看，问问学习和生活的情形。如果他们带有书籍或画报，总要给我们留下几本。就这样，现在我校共收到了书籍、画报一百多本。这些书籍，不但帮助我们的下一代了解了我们祖国的伟大和我们领袖毛主席的英明，也供给了我们教师和本地的侨胞们许多珍贵的精神粮食。
    志愿军同志们不独热爱在朝鲜的华侨学生，他们对朝鲜所有的儿童都给予同样的帮助。驻在本地的某部二大队同志，一到此地就派人到我校来访问。当他们知道了朝鲜的学生们缺乏文具用品的情形之后，全队同志发挥了伟大的国际主义精神，发动了捐赠运动。有的同志赠出了手巾、袜子，有的拿出了钢笔，有的功臣们把自己得到的光荣的奖品——手册等捐献出来。除了物品以外，他们还捐赠了人民币一千二百万元，到祖国买了一千二百打铅笔和三千册学习本子，分送全郡一万三千名中小学生；还买了一批钢笔分送朝鲜人民军军属和烈属的子女。
    在接受赠品的大会上，龟城郡的教育课长说：“中国人民志愿军不但帮助我们朝鲜人民打败了美帝国主义的侵略，还这样关心我们的学校和学生们。我们全郡各级学校将举行一个‘朝中亲善周’来学习中国人民伟大的国际主义精神。”朝鲜的学生代表说：“我们接到中国人民志愿军叔叔们送给我们这样多的东西，心中的高兴和谢意用言语是表达不出来的，我们只有努力学习，加强团结，支援人民军和中国人民志愿军，早日消灭美国侵略军和李承晚傀儡军。”会后，全郡以教育课长为首的全体教员，托我向咱们祖国人民致以最高的敬意。
