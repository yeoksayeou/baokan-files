    Women's Representative Chen Shuping Mobilized Eight Embezzlers to Confess
    Wang Kuang
    Since Tianjin launched its vigorous anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, women's representative Chen Shuping has single-handedly mobilized eight embezzlers to confess their embezzlement, the first of whom was her husband. Chen Shuping also actively promoted the significance of this movement to residents.

    Chen Shuping is a women's representative on No. 1 Road, Fifth District, Tianjin. After listening to several mobilization reports on anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, she began to ponder: As a women's representative, I should do a good job of publicizing to the women and mobilizing everyone to participate in this movement. Not a single embezzler can be let off... Thinking of this, she immediately thought of her husband, Li Xiangtao's, embezzlement. The year before last, in May, Li Xiangtao was working as an accountant in the Fifth District Dock Workers' Union. Every time he paid the workers their wages, he kept the leftover change for himself; visiting merchants often treated him to dinner and gave him gifts. Chen Shuping thought: Isn't this embezzlement and bribery? If he accepts gifts from people, he will definitely forget the interests of the country and the people, give the merchants some benefits, and there will be losses to state property. So she decided to be the first to mobilize her husband to confess, and then persuade others.

    That evening, as soon as Li Xiangtao got off work, Chen Shuping brought up the matter with him, explained the significance of the movement to him, and advised him to confess to the stevedores' union. At the time, Li Xiangtao vaguely agreed. But by the next evening, she heard that her husband had not yet confessed, and she became anxious. She continued to mobilize him, saying, "Think about it, I am a women's representative, you are a reader, and a group leader in the factory. Every time a movement comes, we actively take the lead. If our hands and feet are not clean in this movement, how can we mobilize the masses? Moreover, the only way out for embezzlers is 'confession'. Think again, what kind of life did we live before? We couldn't even get a full meal. After liberation, the government gave you a job so that we can eat our fill and dress warmly. Now, if you have embezzlement behavior and don't honestly confess and thoroughly reform, you are betraying the interests of the working class." These few words made Li Xiangtao lower his head. Finally, Chen Shuping made up her mind and said: "You think it over carefully. Don't think that because our husband and wife have a good relationship, I will be impartial if you don't confess!" These words moved Li Xiangtao, and he immediately went to the police station to confess his past embezzlement and bribery, and also exposed those who embezzled with him.

    After Li Xiangtao confessed, both he and his wife felt very relaxed. Chen Shuping used her husband's example to publicize the benefits of voluntarily confessing to the masses, paying special attention to publicizing it to some suspected criminals. First, she thought of Liu Hongyu in the same courtyard, who worked in the cooperative of the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and also handled money and materials, and may have embezzled. So Chen Shuping mobilized Sister-in-law Liu to mobilize Liu Hongyu well. She said, "It is shameful for a husband to be an embezzler. It is only a glorious thing for women to mobilize their husbands to confess. Embezzlers can only receive lenient treatment from the People's Government if they confess." The more Sister-in-law Liu listened, the more she thought it was right. She thought to herself that if her husband had embezzled something and was exposed by others, not only would her husband be punished, but she would also lose face. So, Sister-in-law Liu also mobilized her husband, Liu Hongyu, to go to the cooperative to explain the matter clearly.

    In order to make the masses further understand the significance of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Chen Shuping patiently conducted door-to-door propaganda in the nearby area. She said: "Calling a big meeting is afraid that the children will be noisy and can't explain clearly, so it's more effective to go from door to door." Every morning, she took dry food and went out to publicize. After her propaganda, the women in the vicinity knew that embezzlement and bribery were a shameful thing. In addition to publicizing to women, Chen Shuping also publicized to nearby industrial and commercial households, mobilizing them to confess to bribery and tax evasion. After her mobilization, two merchants confessed their problems. Then, Chen Shuping continued to mobilize four embezzlers to confess their embezzlement.

    Chen Shuping not only publicized in the vicinity of her residence, but also helped the women's representatives in Xiaohaizhuang, where she used to live, to publicize. During the Spring Festival, Chen Shuping was afraid that the representatives would be busy with the Spring Festival and slacken the propaganda work, so she said to everyone: "We can't put the propaganda work aside because of the Spring Festival, we should regard it as the most important thing. As the saying goes: 'It's easy to defend against bandits in the wild, but hard to defend against thieves in the house.' We must be careful. Only by eradicating all the embezzlers can our country be built well and everyone can live a happy life!"

    动员了八个贪污分子坦白的妇女代表陈淑萍
    王匡
    自从天津市大张旗鼓地展开了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动以来，妇女代表陈淑萍一个人就动员了八个贪污分子坦白了他们的贪污行为，其中第一个就是她的丈夫。陈淑萍并积极向居民宣传这次运动的重要意义。
    陈淑萍是天津市五区一号路的妇女代表。他自从听了几次关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的动员报告后，就开始琢磨：我是个妇女代表，应该很好地向妇女们进行宣传，动员大家都来参加这个运动。对那些贪污分子一个也不能放过……。想到这里，她马上想起自己丈夫李祥涛的贪污事情来。前年五月，李祥涛在五区码头工会做司账工作，每次给工人发工资时，把发剩下的零钱自己留下来；来往的商人常请他吃饭，送礼给他。陈淑萍想：这不就是贪污受贿吗？他受了人家的礼，就一定会忘了国家人民的利益，给商人一些好处，对国家财产就有损失。于是她决定第一个动员丈夫坦白，然后再去说服别人。
    当天晚上，李祥涛刚下班，陈淑萍就和他提起这事来，并且给他解释这次运动的意义，劝他把这事向搬运工会坦白出来。当时李祥涛含糊地答应了。可是到了第二天晚上，她听说她丈夫还没有坦白，她心里就急了，又继续动员他，对他说：“你想想，我是个妇女代表，你是个读报员，在厂里又是小组长，每次运动来了，我们都积极带头，如果我们在这次运动中手脚不干净，如何能把群众发动起来呢？何况贪污分子的出路只有‘坦白’一条。再想想，咱们以前过的是什么日子，连顿饱饭都吃不上，解放后，政府给了你工作，使咱们吃得饱，穿得暖。现在你如果有贪污行为不老老实实坦白出来，彻底改造，你就是背叛了工人阶级的利益。”几句话说得李祥涛低了头。最后陈淑萍下了决心说：“你好好考虑考虑，别看咱们夫妇感情好，如果你不坦白，我可要对事不对人了！”这席话感动了李祥涛，他立刻到派出所去坦白了过去贪污受贿的事情，并且检举了和他一起贪污的人。
    李祥涛坦白以后，他们夫妇俩都感到很轻松。陈淑萍就以她丈夫的例子，向群众宣传自动坦白的好处，特别注意向一些嫌疑分子宣传。首先她想到同院的柳鸿玉，他在棉纺一厂合作社工作，也是经手银钱物资的，说不定有贪污的行为。于是陈淑萍就动员柳大嫂好好动员柳鸿玉。她说：“丈夫是贪污分子是可耻的，妇女只有动员丈夫坦白才是件光荣的事，贪污分子也只有坦白才能得到人民政府的宽大处理。”柳大嫂听了越想越对，心想自己丈夫如果有贪污的事，被别人检举出来，不仅丈夫要受处分，自己脸上也不好看。于是，柳大嫂也就动员了她丈夫柳鸿玉到合作社去把问题交代清楚了。
    为了使群众更进一步地了解反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的意义，陈淑萍耐心地在附近一带进行挨门挨户的宣传，她说：“召集大会怕孩子吵闹，说不清，不如挨门串户有效力。”每天一清早她带上干粮就出去宣传，经过她的宣传，附近的妇女都知道贪污受贿是件可耻的事。陈淑萍除了向妇女们进行宣传外，还向附近的工商户宣传，动员他们坦白行贿漏税的事，经她动员后，有两家商户交代了问题。接着陈淑萍又继续动员四个贪污分子坦白了自己的贪污行为。
    陈淑萍不仅在自己住所的附近一带进行宣传，还帮助她从前住过的小孩庄一带的妇女代表进行宣传。在春节时，陈淑萍恐怕代表们忙着过春节，把宣传工作松懈下来，于是她就对大家说：“咱们不能因为过春节就把宣传工作搁起来，我们应该把它看成头等重要的事。俗语说：‘野贼好防，家贼不好防’，我们要留心，只有把贪污分子都铲除了，我们国家才能建设好，大家才能过幸福日子！”
    妇女代表陈淑萍就是这样认真地进行工作，使她的周围的妇女群众积极地参加到这个运动中来，成为反贪污斗争中的一支力量！    （新华社）
