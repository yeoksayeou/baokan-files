    Tianjin's institutions of higher education have further deepened the struggle to criticize bourgeois ideology since early February. This movement has thoroughly exposed the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie in higher education, laying a favorable foundation for the reform of higher education.
    This ideological struggle was conducted under the direct leadership of the Municipal Committee for Economy and Savings' Cultural and Educational Branch and the economy and savings branch committees of various schools, with full mobilization of the broad masses of students. Each school, at the department level, began with preliminary self-criticism and mutual criticism by teachers. Students, with a responsible attitude towards their teachers, fairly, sincerely, and sharply exposed and criticized the various erroneous ideas existing among the teachers. In the early stages of the movement, many teachers did not sufficiently recognize the great significance of this movement. Many teachers had ideological concerns, fearing that exposing their problems in front of students would damage their prestige and that they would not gain the trust of the masses. These thoughts seriously hindered the progress of the movement at that time. Huang Songling, Director of the Cultural and Educational Branch of the Municipal Committee for Economy and Savings, in light of this ideological situation, convened a mobilization report for teachers in all Tianjin higher education institutions on March 14, criticizing some of the incorrect ideas among teachers, pointing out the important significance of this ideological struggle, and calling on everyone to adopt a sincere, honest, and bold attitude to expose and criticize errors, and to be determined to correct errors in order to be welcomed and supported by the masses, and to gain the people's trust. This report effectively resolved many ideological problems for the teachers and powerfully promoted the movement. Many teachers felt enlightened by the report, thus dispelling their ideological concerns. Some teachers also deeply examined themselves, expressing their willingness to boldly expose their problems, put down their dirty baggage, and, with the help of the masses, determined to transform themselves.
    Through this ideological struggle, the serious pro-American and worship-American ideology, and even the ideology of failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, existing among the teachers of Tianjin's higher education institutions were more deeply exposed. For example, a teacher at the Normal College believed that China was inferior to the United States in all aspects, even in skin color. A teacher, because of admiring the "American way of life," even lost his national stance and wanted to become an American citizen. More seriously, some professors even sold out the interests of the motherland by sending national economic intelligence to the United States. The movement also revealed the seriousness of the existence of bourgeois profit-seeking, personal reputation and status, arrogance, and other decadent ideas among teachers. Their teaching purpose was not to cultivate outstanding talents for the motherland, but to instill materialism. Some professors even set up factories or engaged in business outside the school, concurrently serving as capitalists. For example, some teachers at Tsinku University set up offices outside the school to do business. A professor at Tianjin University said to the students: "If you draw well and are selected by the owners, you can make money." Some professors in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Nankai University even said: "If you study chemical analysis seriously, you will definitely be able to make a fortune from it in the future." A professor at Tianjin University used a textbook that had been used for twenty years without changing a single word, and even referred to Hebei Province as "Zhili." A professor in the Physics Department, because his lectures did not meet the requirements of the students, some students raised objections to him, and he said: "Anyway, what I teach is this set, if you raise objections, I will pack up and leave." A lecturer teaching anatomy used yellow stories to pass the time, and even called it "gossip medicine." Some professors even opposed students signing up for the patriotic action of military cadre schools. Under the influence of this decadent educational ideology, many students developed biases such as "burying themselves in books, not asking about politics" and "aiming too high and being divorced from reality." For example, some students at Tianjin University did not know that our country is led by the working class; some students at Nankai University did not know what the Common Program was.
    During the study, the students of various schools, with full enthusiasm and a sincere attitude, repeatedly raised serious opinions to the teachers. Many teachers, based on the opinions raised among themselves and the opinions of the students, repeatedly conducted relatively deep examinations of their political stance, academic viewpoints, and work attitude at the department-level teacher-student conferences. All relatively deep examinations were warmly welcomed by the students. They said: "If it were not for this movement, I would not know how wrong I was." The teachers and students of various schools gave serious criticism to a few teachers who were not honest in their attitude and not deep in their examination.
    At present, the struggle to criticize bourgeois ideology in Tianjin's higher education institutions is continuing to deepen.

    天津市各高等学校教师揭发和批判资产阶级的腐朽思想
    天津市高等学校批判资产阶级思想的斗争是在二月上旬进一步深入展开的。通过这一运动，彻底揭发了资产阶级在高等学校中的思想影响，为改革高等教育打下有利的基础。
    这次思想斗争是在市节约检查委员会文教分会及各校节约检查支会的直接领导下，充分发动广大同学进行的。各校均以系级为单位，首由教师进行初步自我检讨，相互批评，同学们本着对老师负责的态度，公正、诚恳、尖锐地揭发并批判了教师中存在的各种错误思想。在运动初期，由于很多教师对这个运动的重大意义还认识不够，当时很多教师存有思想顾虑，怕在学生面前暴露了自己的问题会损害威信，怕得不到群众的信任。这些思想，都严重地阻碍了当时运动的进展。市节约检查委员会文教分会黄松龄主任委员，根据这种思想情况，于三月十四日召集全市高等学校教师做了一次动员报告，批判了教师中的一些不正确的思想，指出这次思想斗争的重要意义，号召大家采取诚恳老实、大胆暴露、批判错误、下决心改正错误的态度来投入这个运动，这样才能为群众所欢迎和拥护，才会更得到人民的信任。这个报告切实地为教师们解决了不少思想问题，有力地推动了运动。很多教师都感到从报告中得到了启发，因而打消了思想顾虑。有的教师并深刻地检讨了自己，表示愿意大胆地暴露自己的问题，放下肮脏的包袱，在群众的帮助下，决心来改造自己。
    通过这次思想斗争，更加深入地揭发了天津市各高等学校教师中存在着的严重的亲美崇美思想，乃至敌我不分的思想。如师范学院某教师认为中国各方面都不如美国，连皮肤颜色都落后。某教师因为崇拜“美国生活方式”，竟丧失民族立场，想入美国籍。更严重的是，有的教授甚至出卖祖国利益，将国家经济情报寄到美国去。在运动中，也暴露出资产阶级的唯利是图、个人名誉地位、狂妄自大等腐朽思想在教师中存在的严重性。他们教学的目的，不是为祖国培养优秀人才，而是灌输拜金主义。有些教授甚至在校外设厂或经商，身兼资本家。如津沽大学有些教师在校外设立事务所，做生意。天津大学有一位教授向同学们说：“你们把图画好，被业主选上，就可以赚钱。”南开大学化工系有的教授甚至说：“认真学好化工分析，以后一定可以从中捞一笔。”天津大学有一位教授讲课时竟用一本用了二十年的讲义，只字未改，竟至称河北省为“直隶”。物理系有一位教授因讲课不符合同学们的要求，有些同学向他提出意见，他说：“反正我讲的就是这一套，你们提意见，我就卷铺盖。”有一位教解剖学的讲师，用黄色故事来混时间，还美其名曰“花边医学”。有的教授竟反对同学报名参加军事干部学校的爱国行动。许多同学就在这种腐朽的教育思想的影响下，产生了“埋头读书，不问政治”，“好高骛远，脱离实际”的偏向。如天津大学有些同学竟不知道我们国家是工人阶级领导的；南开大学有些同学竟不知道共同纲领是什么。
    在学习当中，各校同学以饱满的情绪，诚恳的态度，再三向教师们提出严正的意见。很多教师就根据相互间提出的意见和同学的意见，反复在系级师生大会上对自己的政治立场、学术观点和工作态度等进行了比较深刻的检讨。凡是比较深刻的检讨，都受到同学们的热烈欢迎。他们表示：“要不是这次运动，还不知道自己错误到怎样的地步。”对少数态度不老实，检讨不深刻的教师，各校师生都给予严正的批评。
    目前，天津市各高等学校批判资产阶级思想的斗争正继续深入展开中。
