Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 4th: At the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 4th, our side continued to point out: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers firmly oppose any suggestion, in any form, to exclude any country from our nominations that fully meet the definition of a neutral nation from participating in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The definition of a neutral nation agreed upon by both sides is the sole criterion for accepting or rejecting a nomination of a neutral nation proposed by either side. Since your side cannot but admit that all the countries nominated by our side fully comply with the definition of a neutral nation agreed upon by both sides, your side has no reason to continue to oppose our nominations, and continue to delay and obstruct the progress of the armistice negotiations. Our side has repeatedly pointed out two reasonable solutions to this problem: both sides simultaneously and at once agree to all the nominations of the other side, or both sides nominate neutral countries that meet the definition agreed upon by both sides, without any consent procedures. In order to reach an armistice agreement quickly, I once again suggest that your side seriously consider these two proposals of ours and accept one of them to reasonably solve this problem. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are awaiting your side's response on this issue.

At the subcommittee on the fourth agenda item, our representative pointed out that the repatriation of prisoners of war should not have been a problem at all, and could have been quickly resolved in accordance with the fair and reasonable principles consistently advocated by our side. However, due to the other side's insistence on its unreasonable so-called "voluntary repatriation" claim, this issue has remained unresolved for more than eighty days, becoming the only obstacle to reaching an agreement on the fourth agenda item. Our representative further specifically pointed out that in order to resolve the fourth agenda item, our side has made great efforts and contributions, enabling the fourth agenda item to make considerable progress. However, due to the other side's insistence on this artificial obstacle, this fundamental issue has not been resolved. The other side must thoroughly understand the crux of the current problem, reconsider its position, abandon its unreasonable "voluntary repatriation" claim, remove the obstacle created by the other side single-handedly, so that the meeting can make progress and the armistice can be achieved.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上
    我重申解决中立国提名问题两种合理提案
    【新华社开城四日电】四日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方继续指出：朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军坚决反对在任何方式之下，企图排除我方完全合乎中立国定义的提名中任何一个国家参加中立国监察委员会的建议，双方协议的中立国定义是接受或拒绝一方所提出的中立国提名的唯一标准，既然你方也不能不承认我方提名中所有的国家，都是完全符合于双方协议的中立国定义的，你方就没有任何理由继续反对我方的提名，继续拖延和阻碍停战谈判的进展。我方已多次指出合理解决这一问题的两种方案：双方同时并一次同意对方的全部提名，或是双方各自提名合乎双方协议的定义的中立国家，而不必进行任何同意手续。为迅速达成停战协议，我再次建议你方郑重考虑我方这两种提案，并接受其中之一以合理解决这一问题，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在这一问题上等待你方的回答。
    第四项议程小组委员会上，我方代表指出战俘的遣返本来绝对不应成为问题，并且依照我方所一贯主张的公平合理的原则早可迅速获得解决，但是由于对方坚持其毫无理由的所谓“自愿遣返”主张，以致花了八十多天的时间，这个问题仍然悬而未决，成为目前第四项议程达成协议的途中的唯一障碍。我方代表更具体指出，为了解决第四项议程，我方作了巨大的努力与贡献，使第四项议程得以获得相当的进展，但由于对方坚持这个人为的障碍，以致这一基本问题始终不能解决。对方必须彻底了解目前问题的症结之所在，重新考虑其立场，放弃其无理的“自愿遣返”主张，移去对方所一手制造的障碍，使会议能有进展，停战得以实现。
