    Resolutely Prevent and Extinguish Forest Fires
    Forests are an important resource for national construction and a powerful barrier for industrial and agricultural production. Our country's economic construction is gradually recovering and developing, requiring a large supply of timber. However, our country's original forest reserves are far from meeting current needs. Therefore, we must make the greatest efforts to do a good job in forest protection and afforestation. Over the past three years, under the leadership of local Party organizations and people's governments, China's forestry work has achieved certain results. However, it must be admitted that our forest protection work is still very poor. In particular, forest fires have not yet been effectively prevented, and they continue to cause significant damage to the country's forests. This phenomenon must not be allowed to continue. On March 4, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Instructions to Local Party Committees at All Levels on the Issue of Preventing Forest Fires," and the State Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Strictly Preventing Forest Fires." This is an urgent political task for Party, government, military, and civilian personnel in forest areas and the broad masses of people, and it must be resolutely implemented.
    Why do such serious forest fires frequently occur in forest areas? The most fundamental reason is that the leading cadres in these areas lack sufficient understanding of the importance of forest protection and fire prevention, and they have not resolutely implemented the Central Committee's policy of protecting mountains and forests. Individual areas have even adopted an intolerable bureaucratic attitude towards forest protection and fire prevention. Some leading cadres in forest areas have serious complacency and self-satisfaction. They believe that as long as they issue instructions, make resolutions, and deploy work, they can sit back and relax. However, they are unwilling to conduct in-depth inspections and supervisions of specific work; they have not personally gone to forest areas to conduct thorough investigations and research to identify the root causes and loopholes that can lead to fires and take timely measures to overcome them; at the same time, they have not fully mobilized the masses in forest areas to conscientiously implement the forest protection policy among the masses. As a result, the evil consequences of mountain fires spreading every spring occur continuously. This serious lesson should never be repeated in the future. Some leading cadres in forest areas also isolate and emphasize agricultural production, and even fear that deploying forest protection and fire prevention work will delay agricultural production. Therefore, they are unwilling to combine spring forest protection and fire prevention with spring plowing. They do not understand that in the seasons when mountain fires are prone to occur every year, people's governments at all levels in and near mountainous areas should list forest protection and fire prevention as one of the central tasks. Last spring, Party and government leading organs at all levels in Jilin Province took charge at each level, conscientiously deployed and inspected forest protection and fire prevention work, and extensively mobilized the masses to protect forests and prevent fires. As a result, no major fires occurred, and spring plowing was able to proceed smoothly. In contrast, the leading organs in several places were afraid of affecting spring plowing and did not dare to deploy forest protection and fire prevention work. When mountain fires occurred, they mobilized a large number of people to put out the fires, which halted spring plowing for half a month, both delaying the farming season and causing great losses to the country's forests. This proves that agricultural production and forest protection and fire prevention are unified central tasks, and the view that the two tasks are contradictory is completely wrong.
    There are also some leading cadres in forest areas who hold a one-sided mass viewpoint and mistakenly believe that "burning wasteland is a habit of the masses," and that without burning wasteland, "there is no way to open up land" and it will "affect production." They adopt a perfunctory attitude towards the Central Committee's regulations strictly prohibiting burning and reclaiming wasteland, and even arbitrarily revise the decisions of higher authorities and casually approve the masses to burn wasteland. This was the main reason for the forest fires that occurred last spring. The facts of the past two or three years have proven that only when the leading organs conscientiously conduct persuasion and education and raise the political awareness of the masses to cherish the property of the motherland can the masses in mountainous areas completely stop burning and reclaiming wasteland. The problem still lies in the fact that some cadres stubbornly hold a one-sided "mass viewpoint," preferring to accommodate the backward habits of a few masses in burning wasteland rather than conducting persuasion and education work among the masses. As a result, they sit idly by while the country's valuable resources suffer huge losses, which is absolutely intolerable. Now, all localities must resolutely implement the State Council's repeatedly instructed policy of "strictly prohibiting burning and reclaiming wasteland" without any wavering.
    Forest protection and fire prevention work is a mass movement in forest areas, and the masses must be mobilized to participate as widely as possible. It is by no means possible to rely solely on forestry agencies and a few forestry cadres. Forestry agencies and forestry cadres should and must strive to do a good job in forest protection and fire prevention work, which is their duty; however, all organs, troops, industrial and mining enterprises, and farms in and near forest areas should also, in accordance with the State Council's instructions, be responsible for doing a good job in forest protection and fire prevention within their respective scopes, and should also assist the government in preventing mountain fires in nearby areas. As long as everyone raises their vigilance and prevents problems before they occur, not only can we ensure the elimination of the source of mountain fires, but we can also prevent those ill-intentioned elements who attempt to destroy forests from having any opportunity to take advantage of.
    Protecting the forests of the motherland, actively participating in fire prevention and firefighting work, and fighting tenaciously against forest fires are our basic slogans for mobilizing the masses. In and near forest areas, especially in the main forest areas that the country is developing, most or even all of the income of the masses depends on forestry production. At the same time, the main wealth that these areas contribute to the country is timber and various forest products. Therefore, protecting forests is closely linked to the vital interests of the people. The central task of the local Party and government leading organs and all cadres is to lead the masses, mobilize all forces, and protect the mountains and forests so that the broad masses can carry out forestry and agricultural production with peace of mind.
    Now that the spring fire prevention period has arrived, Party and government leading cadres at all levels in and near forest areas must conscientiously study and implement this important instruction of the State Council of the Central People's Government. While deploying drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing work, they must list fire prevention and forest protection work as one of the central tasks at present. All Party and government leading organs in and near forest areas should immediately mobilize, organize, and lead the broad masses to fight for strictly preventing forest fires and protecting the forests of our great motherland!

### 坚决防止和扑灭森林火灾

    坚决防止和扑灭森林火灾
    森林是国家建设的重要资源，也是工农业生产的有力屏障。我们国家的经济建设正在逐步地恢复和发展，需要大量的木材供应，但是，我国原有的森林蓄积，远远不能供应当前的需要。因此，必须用最大的努力来作好护林造林工作。三年来，在各地党的组织和人民政府的领导下，我国林业工作，已经获得了一定的成绩。但是，应该承认，我们的护林工作还是作得很差的。特别是对于森林火灾，至今还未能有效地加以防止，它还在继续使国家的森林遭受重大的破坏。这种现象是绝不能任其继续存在的。三月四日中共中央发布了“关于防止森林火灾问题给各级地方党委的指示”，中央人民政府政务院发布了“关于严防森林火灾的指示”，这是林区党政军民和广大人民当前紧急的政治任务，必须坚决贯彻执行。
    为什么林区常发生这样严重的森林火灾呢？最基本的原因是由于这些地区的领导干部对护林防火工作的重要性认识不足，对中央的保护山林的政策没有坚决执行。有个别地区甚至对于护林防火工作采取了令人不能容忍的官僚主义的态度。有些林区的领导干部存在着严重的麻痹思想和自满情绪。他们以为只要发了指示，作了决议，布置了工作，便可以高枕无忧了。而对于具体工作，却不肯进行深入的检查和督促；没有亲自到林区去，进行充分的调查研究工作，找出各种可以招致火灾的根源和漏洞并及时设法加以克服；同时也没有充分发动林区群众，认真把护林政策贯彻到群众中去，以致每逢春季即不断发生山火燎原的恶果。这种严重的教训今后绝不应该重复了。也有些林区的领导干部，孤立地强调农业生产，甚至怕布置护林防火工作会耽误农业生产，因而不肯把春季护林防火和春耕工作结合起来同时进行。他们不了解在每年容易发生山火的季节，山区及山区附近的各级人民政府应把护林防火工作，列为中心工作之一。去年春季，吉林省各级党、政领导机关，层层负责，认真布置、检查护林防火工作，广泛地发动群众护林防火，因而未发生大的火灾，使春耕生产得以顺利进行。与此相反，有几个地方的领导机关，害怕影响春耕，不敢布置护林防火工作，及至发生山火，为救火动员了大批人力，使春耕停止达半月之久，既误了农时，又造成了国家森林的极大损失。这就证明了农业生产和护林防火工作是统一的中心任务，认为两件工作有矛盾的观点是完全错误的。
    还有些林区的领导干部，抱着片面的群众观点，错误地认为“烧荒是群众的习惯”，不烧荒则“无法开地”、“影响生产”。他们对中央严禁烧垦烧荒的规定，采取阳奉阴违的态度，甚至擅自修改上级的决定，随便批准群众烧荒，这是去年春季发生森林火灾的主要原因。两三年来的事实证明，只有领导机关认真进行说服教育，提高群众爱护祖国财产的政治觉悟，山区群众是完全可以不再烧垦烧荒的。问题还在于某些干部顽固地抱着片面的“群众观点”，宁愿迁就少数群众烧荒的落后习惯，而不愿到群众中进行说服教育工作，结果，坐视国家的可贵资源遭受巨大损失，这是绝不能容忍的。现在，各地必须坚决执行政务院所一再指示的“严禁烧垦烧荒”的方针，不能有任何动摇。
    护林防火的工作是林区的群众性的运动，必须最广泛地发动群众参加，绝不能单纯地依靠林业机关和少数林业干部来作。林业机关和林业干部应该而且必须努力把护林防火工作做好，这是他们的职责；但是林区及林区附近所有的机关、部队、工矿企业及农场等，同样应当按照政务院指示，除负责做好所属范围内的护林防火工作外，并应协助政府防止附近地区的山林火灾。只要大家都提高警惕，防患于未然，就不仅可以保证消灭山火的来源，而且还可以使那些企图破坏森林的不良分子无机可乘。
    保卫祖国的森林，积极参加防火和灭火工作，顽强地和森林火灾作斗争；这是我们动员群众的基本口号。在林区及林区附近，特别是国家正在开发着的主要林区，群众的大部甚至全部收入，都是依靠林业生产的，同时，这些地区向国家所贡献的主要财富，也正是木材和各种林产品。因此，保护森林是同人民的切身利益密切联系在一起的。当地党政领导机关及全体干部的中心任务，就是领导群众，动员一切力量，保护山林，以便广大群众安心地进行林业和农业生产。
    现在，春季防火时期已到，林区和林区附近各级地方党政领导干部，必须认真地研究和执行中央人民政府政务院的这一重要指示，并在布置防旱、抗旱、春耕工作的同时，要把防火护林工作列为当前中心工作之一。一切林区和林区附近的党、政领导机关应即动员起来，组织和领导广大群众，为严防森林火灾，保护伟大祖国的森林而奋斗！
