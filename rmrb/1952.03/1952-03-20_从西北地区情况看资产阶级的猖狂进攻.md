From the situation in Northwest China, let's examine the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie.

Zhao Shouyi

After the victory of the revolution across the country, the political situation fundamentally changed. The Chinese working class became the leading class of the state, and the Communist Party became the leadership party recognized by the people of the whole country. However, this does not mean that the opposition between the working class and the bourgeoisie has disappeared, or that the class struggle has stopped or eased; on the contrary, the class struggle has become more intense and complex.

The national bourgeoisie of China had a considerable position economically and politically during the period of the New Democratic Revolution, playing a certain role. In the past three years, under the leadership of the working class, they have achieved considerable development and unprecedented benefits. They have also played a certain role in developing industrial production and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. This is one aspect. On the other hand, after the bourgeoisie’s economic strength became relatively strong and they gained a certain political position, they wanted to develop private capitalism without limits, trying every means to weaken the strength of the state-owned economy and oppose the leadership of the state-owned economy and the working class. However, because the people's democratic revolution has already been victorious, the leadership of the working class has been established nationwide, and the Chinese national bourgeoisie does not have the conditions to lead the Chinese revolution and national construction, and does not have much prestige among the people. Therefore, the bourgeoisie cannot openly compete with the working class for leadership nationwide, but instead uses hidden and vile means, attempting to seize leadership from within the state-owned economy and from within the organs of the Party, government, army, people, and schools, in order to achieve the goal of swapping the sky and replacing the pillars.

When Chairman Mao called for the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the ferocious faces of the bourgeoisie were exposed, arousing the indignation of the working class and the people of the whole country, who wanted to suppress the bourgeoisie’s rampant attacks. Like other parts of the country, the strategists of the bourgeoisie in the Northwest region hurriedly fabricated many lies and fallacies, resolutely opposing the so-called "rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie," in order to deal with the working class's counter-attack and to create a smokescreen for the bourgeoisie's continued attacks. However, the ironclad evidence of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks is irrefutable; how can they be allowed to "deny the loot while carrying the stolen goods"!

A large-scale offensive by the entire class

Judging from the massive amount of material exposed in the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggles in the Northwest region, the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie are a large-scale class offensive, not the "phenomenon of individual regions" or "a few unscrupulous merchants doing bad things" concocted by those bourgeois strategists. The front line of the bourgeoisie's offensive is very broad, from the interior to the border areas, from industrially and agriculturally advanced areas to backward semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, to the grasslands and pastures where ethnic minorities live. From cities to villages, from key departments of finance and economics to the internal organs of the Party, government, army, people, and schools, they are like mercury seeping into every crevice.

The most numerous and widespread acts of aggression by the bourgeoisie are bribing state employees, evading taxes, stealing state property, cutting corners, and stealing state economic intelligence. And the bourgeois elements who actually participated in or partially participated in this offensive action were not a small number of people, but the vast majority. According to preliminary statistics from Xi'an, including tax evasion, there are 12,369 households, accounting for more than 80% of the total number of households. The "results" of the offensive are considerable. According to materials from Xi'an alone as of March 4, the state's losses are more than 251.4 billion yuan. In addition, the illegal capitalists' deeds of reselling gold and silver, manufacturing fake medicines and fake flour, selling opium, and harming the Chinese People's Volunteers, which are heinous, profit-seeking, and treasonous acts of helping the enemy, are even harder to calculate.

Of course, after the founding of the People's Republic of China, there were law-abiding capitalists among the bourgeoisie; however, there were many capitalists who were semi-law-abiding or seriously law-breaking. Look, the scale of their offensive is so broad, so all-pervasive, and the number of participants in the offensive is so large, more than 80%. Then, this cannot be said to be a "phenomenon of individual regions," or that "a few unscrupulous merchants did bad things," but a class tendency. The fundamental purpose of capitalist production is to pursue profits and pursue more profits, which is the "greed of wolves" as Marx pointed out. "With an appropriate profit, capital becomes bold; if there is a definite profit of 10%, capital will be used anywhere; with a profit of 20%, it will become lively; with a profit of 50%, it will become active and bold; when the profit reaches 100%, all the laws set by humans will be kicked away; when the profit reaches 300%, capital will disregard any crime, and the owner of capital will even risk being hanged" (Capital, Volume 1, Reading and Life Publishing House edition, page 650, footnote quotation). From this, it can be seen that the bourgeoisie, as a class, has the inherent nature of being profit-oriented, harming others to benefit oneself, using public office for private gain, and being opportunistic. The bourgeoisie's rampant offensive against the working class in the Northwest and throughout the country is precisely the spontaneous flooding of this class nature of the bourgeoisie.

Vicious attacks on the state-owned economy

In the bourgeoisie's offensive, the most vicious move is the attack on state-owned economic enterprises, which is to weaken and control the state-owned economy from within, and seize leadership. According to the materials recently revealed in various parts of the Northwest, there are roughly the following situations:

First, capitalists, with their factories, shops, and all their personnel, directly rush into state-owned economic enterprises under the guise of serving the people, turning state-owned economic enterprises into tools for capitalists to make money and seek profits. For example, the unscrupulous merchant Ma Rongbin in Lanzhou was originally the manager of Yongxingyuan. Instead of being his manager, he took advantage of the state's establishment of a leather factory, led his deputy manager and all the shop assistants and apprentices, moved to the leather factory, and became a foreman himself, actually manipulating the factory's power, engaging in speculation and theft of state property amounting to 2.2 billion. Another example is Liu Zijun (manager of Yicheng Ganhao), an unscrupulous merchant in Lanzhou, who took the opportunity of the establishment of the Local Products Department of the Northwest Military Supply Department, transferred his business to the public, brought almost all the personnel of the firm, and seized the position of deputy manager of the Local Products Department with the qualifications of "hero".

Second, capitalists themselves drill into state-owned economic enterprises and usurp leadership. One type drilled in after liberation. For example, Liu Minghuan, deputy minister of the Military Industry Department of the Xinjiang Military Region, was originally a factory manager. When the People's Liberation Army marched into Xinjiang, he planned to drill in, showing hard work and endurance, and deceiving the leadership to gain trust. Later, he seized the position of Minister of Military Industry (later demoted to Deputy Minister). In the construction of the textile factory he handled, he colluded with private merchants in Shanghai to steal state property on a large scale. Another type was deliberately buried by the bourgeoisie before liberation. They all have their own systems, such as the head of the financial department, who can control many accountants below; the head of the material department, who can control many material personnel below. There are also connections between them. Still another type is still holding two positions, wearing a uniform to "work" in the organs during the day, and wearing a suit to calculate accounts in his own accounting room at night. For example, Chen Xinghua, deputy section chief of the Engineering Section of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau, is the chairman of the board of directors of the two timber factories, Dasen and Dacheng, in Xi'an. When the Tongguan section repaired the dormitory, he notified the railway bureau's material factory to buy materials as the deputy section chief of the Engineering Section, and at the same time notified Dasen and Dacheng to prepare materials as the chairman of the board, thus stealing state property worth more than 630 million by selling, buying, and accepting the goods himself.

Third, open loopholes, install spies, and implement attacks from both inside and outside. One type of spy only needs to re-establish contact. For example, Yang Tao, the chief of the Engineering Section of the Railway Sub-bureau, colluded with large contractors to steal railway property during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. After liberation, he still colluded with large contractors to steal state property, causing the state to lose as much as 4 billion yuan. Yang's crime was that he personally received 1,000 bags of flour and 18.5 million yuan in RMB. Another example is the huge case in Lanzhou where unscrupulous merchants stole 5.26 billion yuan of state property, which was carried out in collusion with Li Buhai, an internal spy originally hidden in the Gansu branch of the People's Bank of China. Another type is newly installed; for example, when the Shaanxi Southern Acquisition Office of the Livestock Products Company was established, it was surrounded by unscrupulous merchants Wang Deming, Zhang Xingchu, Li Jinxian, Tang Fengzi, Hu Yingxue, and Ha Shaodi. They not only bribed four people in the acquisition office, but also directly sent two spies in, one as the storage and transportation accountant, in charge of inventory materials, and one as the cashier, in charge of cash. This acquisition office actually became a branch of the unscrupulous merchants.

Fourth, using all despicable and vicious methods, pulling the staff of state-owned economic enterprises over to become spies and agents of the capitalists. The most pulled over were the staff retained after liberation. According to statistics from various units stationed in Xi'an in the Northwest financial and economic system, this type of person accounted for more than 51% of the molecules pulled over. This is the weakest link in our team, because this part of the staff is deeply contaminated by the filth of the old society, has not had time to thoroughly transform, has weak resistance, and is easy to go down. The second are young students who have just joined the workforce, lack experience, and are easy to get hooked. The third are the so-called "old cadres," who could not withstand the attack of "sugar-coated bullets," betrayed the people, and became running dogs for the capitalists. Although this part of the internal spies is small in number, the harm is great. For example, Dai Xingwu, director of the Commercial Administration Office of the Northwest Trade Department, after becoming the agent of the unscrupulous merchants Zhang Guangfu, Du Ziliang, Zhang Xida, etc., issued more than 80 export permits to Du Ziliang alone. The export volume of broken copper alone accounted for more than three and a half times the total export volume of state-owned trade institutions in the Northwest, almost completely monopolized.

The bourgeoisie's seizure of state-owned economic enterprises, although different in form and method, has a common characteristic, which is a planned and organized collective action. Jiang Shenghua, manager of the LanZhou HeFeng Trade and Transportation Company, in order to monopolize the Northwest salt market, successively colluded with salt industry capitalists in Lanzhou, Xi'an, Wuwei, Jiuquan, Hami, Hanzhong, and Chengdu, Sichuan, held meetings at the HeFeng Company to discuss how to pull staff down and monopolize the salt market plan. According to preliminary materials, Jiang Shenghua alone has turned more than 50 staff members of the Gansu Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau and other organs into his own agents, spending more than 5,000 silver dollars and more than 30 million yuan in RMB on bribes alone. After completing the above deployment, Jiang openly proposed to abolish the retail departments of the state-owned salt company.

As everyone knows, the state-owned economy is an economy of a socialist nature under the leadership of the working class. It is the public property of all our people and the main foundation for our country's development of production and economic prosperity. This is stipulated in the Common Program, and it was also raised and approved by the representatives of the bourgeoisie. Then, the bourgeoisie, in breach of faith, attempts to seize, control, or weaken one by one the public property of all our people, and tries every means to turn the state economic enterprises that seek welfare for all the people into tools for a few capitalists to fatten themselves. Can this still be said to be an attack? Attacking the state-owned economy is actually usurping the working class's leadership of the state, and it is to drag China to the dead end of capitalism. Is this not obvious?

Planned and organized political offensive

What is worth noting is that the bourgeoisie's offensive is becoming more and more rampant and more and more blatant. Previously, they openly advocated things like "the state-owned economy leads the cities, and the private economy leads the villages," and "the state-owned economy supplies the public, and the private economy supplies the private." Some capitalists believe that workers are not qualified to sit at the same table as the capitalists to hold labor-capital meetings, and some even abuse shop assistants and apprentices. Even after the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence was launched, many illegal capitalists did not stop their offensive, but instead issued fallacies to deal with the working class's counterattack, and tried every means to eliminate the stolen evidence, rush to make false accounts, and sign what "bilateral agreements," "offensive and defensive alliances," and "die-hard alliances," using many methods of threats and inducements in an attempt to disintegrate the fighting forces of workers, shop assistants, and apprentices. There is no need to say more about these extremely common examples. I will only cite two examples here:

The first example is that on January 21 this year, more than 5,000 people from the industrial and commercial circles in Dihua City held a "five-anti" parade in the name of the industrial and commercial circles themselves, which was actually a "demonstration" to the working class and the Communist Party. When the parade passed through the facade of the Provincial Trade Company, they stopped and shouted "Oppose corruption." When the responsible comrades of the province passed through the street in a car, they shouted slogans such as "Oppose corruption" at them. Obviously, this is a political conspiracy. How could such a rampant political demonstration not have a strict organization and command! Another political demonstration, which was even more serious and rampant, took place in Xi'an. When eleven households in the Xi'an printing industry were printing the Northwest District Bank form, Li Haiting of the Zhongxing Printing Factory and others collectively bribed, and as a result, 800 million was stolen from the 2.4 billion printing fee. After the district bank found out and confirmed, the naive comrades of the district bank handed Li Haiting over to the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce for handling. However, some leaders of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, such as Pan Yuanquan, stood on the position of illegal industrial and commercial operators and turned the meeting against the collective bribery of the unscrupulous merchant Li Haiting into a meeting to attack the district bank. Some capitalists even arrogantly said: "This meeting is the Communist Party's biggest failure!" And they shouted triumphantly at the meeting: "Down with the Northwest District Bank!" After that, the Xi'an machinery manufacturing industry openly supported the printing industry, and the illegal group of the printing industry, under the instigation of Pan Yuanquan and other responsible persons of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, held a meeting and put forward the reactionary slogan of "Unite closely and confront the district bank."

Please ask, what is the Northwest District Bank of the People's Bank of China? What is the Communist Party? They dared to openly shout the slogans of "Confront the district bank" and "Down with the district bank" in broad daylight, and discussed "This meeting is the Communist Party's biggest failure" in an extremely arrogant manner. It can be seen how arrogant they are and how rampant they are! The shocking events in Dihua and Xi'an fully prove that after the bourgeoisie's economic strength has become relatively strong and they have gained a certain political position, they not only use various hidden and despicable methods to undermine the foundation of the state-owned economy, but also rapidly launched a blatant political offensive in some areas. This is particularly worthy of our attention.

Resolutely suppress the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks

The struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence that is currently developing and deepening is precisely to suppress the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks. This is a serious class struggle, a counterattack against the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks. After this just revolutionary battle began, among the countless poisonous arrows released by the bourgeoisie's strategists, it was especially emphasized that the bourgeoisie "has no independent army, and does not fight," and therefore cannot be regarded as an offensive. These ghost words can only deceive those honest people who have no political common sense. Who does not know that in class struggle, there are literary struggles and armed struggles, there are bloody armed struggles, and there are also bloodless "peaceful" struggles. There are military struggles, and there are also political, economic, and cultural struggles. How can it be said that only the army fighting can be called a class offensive? What is this if not the bourgeoisie's trickery! It should be pointed out that since the victory of the revolution across the country, the Kuomintang's reactionary rule has been overthrown, and the domestic political situation has fundamentally changed, and therefore the form of class struggle has also changed. The change in the form of struggle is not a moderation of class struggle. As early as 1919, Lenin pointed out to the Soviet people: "After the proletariat seizes power, it does not stop the class struggle, but continues the class struggle—until the class is eliminated—of course, in another environment, adopting another form, and using another means." ("The Great Initiative" Selected Works of Lenin, Volume 2, page 591). The bourgeoisie's offensive against the working class in the past three years is the "another way" and "another means" adopted under the situation where the people's democratic revolution has already been victorious. It is worth pointing out that the "sugar-coated bullets" and hidden and despicable methods used by the bourgeoisie today are, in many ways, easier to confuse people and make us lose vigilance than the open military warfare of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the past, and therefore are even more insidious and cruel. Therefore, in the struggle to counter the bourgeoisie's offensive, we must be vigilant at all times, firmly under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, rely closely on the working class, give full play to the working class's wit and courage, unite all working people, and unite all legitimate industrialists and businessmen, resolutely oppose the bourgeoisie's rampant offensive, adhere to and consolidate the working class's leadership, and strive to meet the great construction of the new China!

    从西北地区情况看资产阶级的猖狂进攻
    赵守一
    革命在全国胜利后，政治情况根本变化了。中国的工人阶级成为国家的领导阶级，共产党成为全国人民公认的领导党。但是，这并不是说工人阶级和资产阶级的对立消灭了，阶级斗争停止了或者缓和了，而是相反地，阶级斗争更加剧烈，更加复杂化了。
    中国的民族资产阶级，在新民主主义革命时期，经济上和政治上都有相当的地位，起一定的作用。三年以来，在工人阶级领导下，有不少发展，得到了空前的利益，他们在发展工业生产和城乡物资交流中，也起了一定的作用。这是一方面。另一方面，资产阶级在自己经济力量比较壮大，政治上有了一定地位之后，就想无限制地发展私人资本主义，千方百计地削弱国营经济的力量，反对国营经济的领导，反对工人阶级的领导。但是，由于人民民主革命已经胜利，工人阶级在全国范围内的领导权已经确定，而中国的民族资产阶级，又没有领导中国革命和国家建设的条件，在人民中也没有多大威信，因而资产阶级就不可能在全国范围内，明目张胆地和工人阶级争夺领导权，而是采用隐蔽的卑劣的手段，企图从国营经济内部，从党、政、军、民、学的机关内部，夺取领导权，以达到偷天换日，抽梁换柱的目的。
    当毛主席号召开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动之后，资产阶级的狰狞面目就暴露出来了，激起了工人阶级和全国人民的义愤，要把资产阶级的猖狂进攻压下去。和全国各地一样，西北地区资产阶级的谋士们，也慌手慌脚地赶忙编出许多谎言谬论，坚决反对有所谓“资产阶级的猖狂进攻”，用以对付工人阶级的反攻，并为资产阶级的继续进攻放烟幕弹。但是，资产阶级猖狂进攻的铁证如山，那能容许“背着牛头不认赃”！
    整个阶级的大规模的进攻
    就西北地区反贪污、反盗窃斗争中所暴露的大量材料看，资产阶级的猖狂进攻，是大规模的阶级进攻，并不是那些资产阶级的谋士们所编造的“个别地区现象”，“少数奸商作了坏事”。资产阶级进攻的战线，十分广阔。从内地到边疆，从工农业先进地区，一直到落后的半农半牧区，到少数兄弟民族生息的草原牧场。从城市到农村，从财经企业要害部门，一直到党、政、军、民、学的机关内部，好似水银泻地，无孔不入。
    资产阶级的进攻行为，最大量最普遍的就是贿赂国家工作人员，偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报。而实际参加或部分参加了这种进攻行动的资产阶级分子，并不是少数几个人，而是绝大多数。据西安市初步的检查统计，包括偷税漏税的在内，就有一万二千三百六十九户，占了全体户数的百分之八十以上。进攻的“战果”相当可观，仅西安市截止三月四日的材料，国家的损失就是二千五百一十四亿多元。此外，违法资本家干的那些倒贩黄金白银、造假药、造料面、贩卖烟毒以及暗害中国人民志愿军等伤天害理、谋财害命、叛国助敌的勾当，就更难得计算了。
    当然，在中华人民共和国成立以后，在资产阶级当中，守法的资本家是有的；但是，半守法的或严重不守法的资本家，却是不少。你看，他们进攻的规模，竟是那样广阔，那样无孔不入，而参加进攻的分子又是那么众多，多到百分之八十以上，那么，这就不能说是“个别地区的现象”，不能说是“少数奸商做了坏事”，而是一种阶级的倾向。资本主义生产的根本目的，就是追求利润和追求更多的利润，就是马克思所指出的“豺狼的贪欲性”。“一有适当的利润，资本就会胆壮起来；如确有百分之十的利润，资本就会在任何地方使用的；有百分之二十的利润，它将活泼起来；有百分之五十的利润，它就积极地大胆了；利润达百分之百，人间所定的一切法律，都将被它踢开了；利润达到百分之三百，资本就会不顾任何的犯罪，资本所有者甚至不惜冒绞首的危险了”（资本论第一卷，读书生活出版社版，六五○页注解中的引语）。由此可见，资产阶级这个阶级，就具有唯利是图、损人利己、假公济私、投机取巧的本性。资产阶级在西北和在全国地区，向工人阶级的猖狂进攻，正是资产阶级这种阶级本性的自发泛滥。
    向国营经济的恶毒进攻
    在资产阶级的进攻中，最恶毒的一着就是向国营经济企业的进攻，就是从国营经济内部削弱和控制国营经济，夺取领导权。根据最近西北各地已经公开揭露的材料看，大体上有这样几种情况：
    第一，资本家带着他的工厂商店和全部人马，披着为人民服务的外衣，直接冲进国营经济企业内部，把国营经济企业变成资本家发财牟利的工具。像兰州市的奸商马荣彬，本来是永兴源号的经理，放下他的经理不当，却趁着国家成立制皮工厂的机会，率领了他的副经理和全体店员学徒，搬到皮革厂来，自己当了一名领工，实操工厂大权，投机倒把，盗窃国家财产达二十二亿。又如兰州奸商刘子俊（益成干号经理），趁西北军人供应处成立土产部的机会，便把自己的商号转让给公家，把全号人员几乎全班带来，并以“功臣”资格，窃据土产部副经理。
    第二，资本家本人钻进国营经济企业，篡夺领导权。一种是解放后钻进来的。如新疆军区军工部副部长刘明环，原系工厂经理，当人民解放军向新疆进军时，就有计划地钻进来，表现吃苦耐劳，骗取领导信任，后即窃据军工部长（后降为副部长）。在他经手的纺织厂建筑中，即勾结上海私商，大肆盗窃国家资财。另一种是临解放时，资产阶级有计划地埋伏下的。他们都有各自的系统，如财务部门的头子，可以控制下面许多会计；材料部门的头子，可以控制下面许多材料人员。他们之间亦有联系。还有一种，是现在仍一身二任，白天穿着制服上机关“办公”，晚上穿着西装在他自己的账房里算账。像西安铁路分局工务科副科长陈兴华，本人就是西安大森、大成两个木厂的董事长。当潼关段修宿舍时，即以工务科副科长的资格通知路局材料厂买料，同时又以董事长的资格通知大森、大成备料，他就这样自卖、自买、自己验收地盗窃了国家财产六亿三千多万。
    第三，打开缺口，安上坐探，实行内外夹攻。有一种坐探是原来的只要接一下关系就行。如铁路分局工务科长杨涛，在国民党反动统治时期，就和大包商勾结一起，盗窃铁路资财。解放后仍与大包商勾结一起，盗窃国家财产，使国家损失达四十亿元之巨。杨犯个人分得面粉一千袋，人民币一千八百五十万元。再如兰州破获的奸商盗窃国家资财五十二亿六千万元的巨案，就是与原来藏在人民银行甘肃分行的内奸厉不害勾结进行的。另一种是新安置的；如畜产公司陕南收购处建立时，即被奸商汪德明、张星初、李进贤、唐疯子、胡营学、哈少弟等包围，不仅买通了收购处的四个人，而且还直接派了两个坐探进去，一个当了储运会计，掌握了库存物资，一个当了出纳，掌握现金。这个收购处，实际上成了奸商的分号。
    第四，用一切卑鄙恶毒的办法，把国家经济企业的工作人员拉过去，变成资本家的坐探、代理人。被拉得最多的是留用的工作人员。据西北财经系统驻西安各单位的统计，在被拉过去的分子中，这种人占百分之五十一强，这是我们队伍中最薄弱的环节，因为这一部分工作人员沾染旧社会的污毒较深，还没有来得及彻底改造，抵抗力弱，容易下水。其次是新参加工作的青年学生，缺少经验，容易上钩。再是所谓“老干部”，经不起“糖衣炮弹”的攻击，背叛了人民，给资本家当了走狗。这一部分内奸，数目虽不多，危害却很大。像西北贸易部商业行政管理处处长代行伍，自作了奸商张光甫、杜子亮、张希达等的代理人后，仅给杜子亮一人即开了八十多张出口证，只碎铜一项的出口量，即占西北各国营贸易机构出口总量的三倍半还多，几乎全被垄断。
    资产阶级夺取国家经济企业，尽管形式不同、方法各异；但却有一个共同的特点，这就是有计划有组织的集体行动。兰州和丰贸易运输商行经理蒋生华，为垄断西北食盐市场，先后勾结兰州、西安、武威、酒泉、哈密、汉中以及四川成都等地的食盐业资本家，在和丰商行开会，商议如何拉工作人员下水及垄断食盐市场的计划。据初步材料，仅蒋生华一人，就把甘肃省盐务局等机关五十多个工作人员，变成自己的代理人，光贿赂就花去白洋五千多枚、人民币三千余万元。蒋于完成上述部署后，即公开提出取消国营盐业公司门市部了。
    大家知道：国营经济是工人阶级领导下的社会主义性质的经济，是我们全体人民的公共财产，是我们国家发展生产繁荣经济的主要基础。这是共同纲领规定了的，也是资产阶级的代表人物举手赞成了的。那么，资产阶级却背信弃义地企图把我们全体人民的公共财产，一个一个地夺取、控制或削弱，把为全体人民谋福利的国家经济企业，千方百计地变为少数资本家肥私的工具，这还能说不是进攻吗？进攻国营经济，实际上就是篡夺工人阶级对国家的领导权，就是要把中国拖到资本主义的死路上去，这难道还不明显吗？
    有计划有组织的政治进攻
    值得注意的，倒是资产阶级的进攻，越来越猖狂，越来越明目张胆了。以前，他们就公开地提倡什么“国营经济领导城市，私营经济领导乡村”，“国营经济供给公家，私营经济供给私人”；有些资本家，认为工人不配同资方坐在一个桌子上开劳资会议，有的竟虐待店员学徒。即在反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗骗国家资财、反对偷工减料、反对盗窃国家经济情报运动开展以后，许多违法资本家也没有停止进攻，而且大发谬论以对付工人阶级的反击，并千方百计地消灭赃证，赶造假账，订立什么“双边协定”、“攻守同盟”、“死守同盟”，用许多威胁利诱的方法，企图瓦解工人、店员、学徒的战斗部队。像这些极为普遍的事例，就用不着多说了。我在这里只举两个例子：
    第一个例子，是今年一月二十一日，迪化市工商界五千余人，名为举行工商界本身的“五反”游行，实际上是向工人阶级和共产党“示威”。当游行队伍通过省贸易公司门面，他们曾停下来高呼“反对贪污”，当省负责同志乘汽车通过街道时，他们即向其高呼“反对贪污”等口号。很明显，这是一个政治阴谋。举行这样一个猖狂的政治示威，又怎能没有一个严密的组织和指挥呢！比这更严重更猖狂的另一次政治示威，发生在西安；西安印刷业十一户，在承印人民银行西北区行表册时，由中兴印刷厂李海亭等集体行贿，结果在二十四亿印刷费中竟被盗窃八亿，经区行查出证实后，天真的区行同志就将李海亭交由市工商联处理。而工商联的若干领导人如潘源泉等，却站在违法工商业者的立场上，把反对奸商李海亭集体行贿的会，一变而为向区行进攻的会。有些资本家竟狂妄地说：“这次会是共产党最大的一次失败！”并得意忘形地在会场高喊：“打倒西北区行！”此后，西安机器制造业亦公开支援印刷业，而印刷业的非法集团，竟在工商联负责人潘源泉等授意下，召开会议，提出“紧密团结，对抗区行”的反动口号。
    请问，人民银行西北区行是什么？共产党是什么？他们竟敢在光天化日之下，公然喊出“对抗区行”、“打倒区行”的口号，嚣张之极地议论“这次会是共产党最大的一次失败”。可见，他们嚣张成什么样子，狂妄到什么程度！迪化和西安的惊人事件，充分证明了资产阶级在自己的经济力量比较壮大，政治上有了一定地位之后，不仅采用隐蔽、卑劣的各种手法，挖国营经济的墙脚，而且在若干地区，迅速开始了明目张胆的政治进攻。这是特别值得我们注意的。
    坚决把资产阶级的猖狂进攻压下去
    目前正在发展和深入着的反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗骗国家资财、反对偷工减料和反对盗窃国家经济情报的斗争，正是要把资产阶级的猖狂进攻压下去。这是一场严重的阶级斗争，是向资产阶级猖狂进攻的反击战。当这一正义的革命战斗开始之后，在资产阶级的谋士们所放出的无数毒箭中，尤其强调资产阶级“没有独立的军队，也没有打仗”，因而不能算做进攻。这些鬼话，只能欺骗那些毫无政治常识的老实人。谁不知道，在阶级斗争中，有文斗、有武斗，有流血的武装斗争，也有不流血的“和平”斗争。有军事斗争，也有政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争，怎么能说只有军队打仗，才能叫做阶级的进攻呢？这不是资产阶级的骗术是什么！应该指出：自从革命在全国胜利后，国民党的反动统治被推翻了，国内的政治情况根本改变了，因而阶级斗争的形式也就改变了。斗争形式的改变，并不是阶级斗争的缓和。列宁在一九一九年就向苏联人民指出过：“无产阶级夺得政权之后，并不停止阶级斗争，而是继续着阶级斗争——直到阶级消灭为止——当然是在另一种环境中，采取另一种形式，运用另一种手段来进行着。”（“伟大的创举”列宁文选两卷集第二卷五九一页）。三年来资产阶级向工人阶级的进攻，就是在人民民主革命已经胜利的情况下所采取的“另一种方式”、“另一种手段”。值得指出的是资产阶级今天所用以进攻的“糖衣炮弹”和隐蔽卑劣的手法，在许多方面，比之昔日蒋介石匪帮公开的军事战争，易于迷惑人，易于使我们丧失警惕，因而也就更加阴险和残酷。所以，我们在反击资产阶级进攻的斗争中，就必须时刻警惕，坚定地在工人阶级和共产党的领导下，紧紧地依靠工人阶级，充分发挥工人阶级的机智和英勇，团结全体劳动人民，并把一切正当的工商业者联合起来，坚决反对资产阶级的猖狂进攻，坚持和巩固工人阶级的领导权，为迎接新中国的伟大建设而奋斗！
