    Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
    Review of the Handling of Discarded Telephone Poles

    To the Editor: On December 8, 1951, the People's Daily published a suggestion from reader Li Kun regarding the prompt handling of discarded telephone poles piled along the railway from Shijiazhuang to Hankou. These poles belong to our Ministry. The circumstances of this matter are briefly described below: In the autumn of 1950, our Ministry undertook the reconstruction project of the Beijing-Hankou long-distance telecommunications line, replacing a large number of discarded old miscellaneous wood poles. If all were transported to places with telecommunications bureaus for storage, the total transportation cost was estimated to exceed the value of the old poles. Therefore, after the completion of the project, it was decided that some of the old poles would be transported back by nearby telecommunications bureaus for their own custody, and the remainder would be collected and stacked by the engineering team and handed over to the village governments along the line for safekeeping. Most of these old poles could still be used in local telephone lines. However, due to the unresolved local telecommunications issues, the old poles have not been properly handled to date.

    Regarding the handling of this matter, our Ministry, although there are the above-mentioned objective reasons, our thinking has not been sufficiently focused. We were simply considering the transportation costs, procrastinating and failing to resolve the issue quickly, and also failing to consider the difficulties of local custodianship. This is a manifestation of a lack of meticulous planning and an irresponsible bureaucratic style of work. In addition to the relevant departments having already conducted reviews, our Ministry has decided to find ways to handle these old poles in the short term.

### 中央邮电部  对废电杆子处理问题的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央邮电部
    对废电杆子处理问题的检讨
    编辑同志：一九五一年十二月八日，人民日报刊载了读者李堃的关于迅速处理堆在石家庄到汉口铁路两旁的废电杆子的建议。这些电杆子归我部所有，今将这件事情的经过情况简述如下：一九五零年秋季，我部办理京汉长途电信线路改筑工程，换下废旧杂木杆子甚多。如果全部运到有电信局的地方存放，全部运费估计要超过旧杆的价值。因此，工程完毕后，就决定把部分旧杆由附近电信局运回自行保管，其余的由工程队收集堆存交沿线村公所保管。这些旧杆大部分还可以在地方电话的线路中使用。但因地方电讯问题尚未解决，旧杆迄今没有加以适当处理。
    我部对于这事的处理，虽有上述客观原因，但我们思想上是不够重视的，只单纯在运费上打算，拖拖拉拉，没有迅速解决，也没照顾到地方上保管的困难。这是工作缺乏精密计划和不够负责的官僚主义作风的表现。除有关部门已做检讨外，我部决定在短期内设法处理这些旧杆。
