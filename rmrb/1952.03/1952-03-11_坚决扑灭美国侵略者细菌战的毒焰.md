Resolutely Extinguish the Poisonous Flames of the American Aggressors' Germ Warfare
We Vow to Fight the American Aggressors to the End
Xiong Jinding, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Red Cross Society

The despicable, shameless, and inhumane American aggressors, under the unparalleled indignant protests of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world, have even expanded the scope of their germ warfare to within the borders of our Northeast China. This barbaric and brutal act further exposes the ambitions and desperate struggles of the American aggressors; it also further demonstrates their increasingly inevitable fate of destruction!

The New China Red Cross Society cannot tolerate such a crazy and inhumane despicable act by the American aggressors. We will continue to strengthen the work of medical prevention service teams, strengthen support for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and strengthen all forces fighting to safeguard world peace and humanitarianism, to give the American aggressors' bestial acts a head-on blow! Every New China Red Cross worker who is engaged in promoting the spirit of revolutionary humanitarianism, every member of the Chinese Red Cross medical prevention team who is engaged in medical and epidemic prevention work, will be a tenacious fighter in extinguishing the poisonous flames of the American aggressors' germ warfare. We will never spare the instigators and perpetrators of germ warfare, and those germ warfare murderers who threaten human safety, insult human dignity, and violate humanitarian conventions must be severely punished. We vow to fight to the end against all enemies whose purpose is anti-humanitarianism!

Chinese Zoological Society Members Mobilize to Crush the Enemy's Germ Warfare
Li Ruqi, Chairman of the Chinese Zoological Society and Head of the Department of Zoology at Peking University

The American aggressors, who are devoid of conscience, have suffered an irreparable and miserable defeat in the face of the mighty and invincible Chinese and Korean people. As a result, on January 17 of this year, they colluded with Japanese germ warfare criminals to conduct germ warfare. Disregarding the just warnings of the Chinese people and peace-loving people of the world, they have intensified their efforts. From February 29 to March 5, they still used a large number of planes to spread germ-carrying insects into our Northeast China. This insane and monstrous crime can only arouse infinite hatred among the Chinese people.

The American imperialists believe that with airplanes, cannons, tanks, and even atomic bombs, they can run amok and dominate the world. But under the iron fist of the people, it is destined to die. Even the germ warfare it is now using cannot save its dying fate. We have the confidence and determination to completely extinguish the germs spread by the enemy. In this regard, all biologists should actively mobilize, organize, and be ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland and go to the posts where we are most needed.

I would like to represent the Chinese Zoological Society in calling on all members across the country to act together with the people of the whole country to take effective measures to give a powerful counterattack to the American aggressors' germ warfare and crush the enemy's vicious conspiracies.

Muslims Rise Up to Denounce the Crimes of American Imperialism
Ma Jian, Professor of the Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University

After suffering a disastrous defeat in Korea, the American invading army used Japanese germ warfare criminals, whose hands were already stained with the blood of the Chinese and Korean people, to conduct various germ experiments and manufacture them, and used captured personnel from the Chinese and Korean People's Armies as experimental subjects. Now, American imperialism has spread a large number of tested germs in Korea and Northeast China to carry out germ warfare in violation of international law and the resolutions of the World Peace Council. This inhumane and monstrous crime has brought my hatred of American imperialism to its peak. I accuse the atrocities of the American invading army and call on Muslims across the country and around the world to unanimously denounce the criminal acts of American imperialism.

Killing the Poisonous Snake
Feng Xuefeng

The American aggressors are already waging germ warfare in Korea, and have also invaded our Northeast with a large number of planes, spreading germs and indiscriminately bombing and strafing.

Now everything is clear. This inhumane germ warfare is being carried out by the aggressors in an attempt to obstruct the Korean armistice talks. In particular, this is the implementation of a long-planned and long-prepared step. After the end of World War II, the American aggressors kept Japanese germ warfare criminals, secretly researching and manufacturing germ weapons. After the start of the Korean War, they even used captured personnel from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers as experimental subjects for germ weapons. It should also be remembered that as early as 1925, among all the major powers at the time, the only ones who refused to ratify the Geneva Convention against germ warfare were the United States and Japan.

But in this way, the facts not only prove that the ferocious and evil nature of the aggressors is innate; but it also proves that the aggressors have long anticipated their day of failure, and therefore have long prepared for the last resort of making a final desperate gamble.

Needless to say, the problem lies not only in the ferocious nature of the aggressors, but especially in the fact that when they approach failure, they will resort to any cruel means of destruction. It is just like a poisonous snake, which often harms people, and when it is beaten to near death, it spews all the venom from its fangs.

However, since the aggressors themselves have proved that they are approaching failure and demise, then we and the people of the world cannot but bravely face their last ferocious move! Everything has been proven to be inevitable, and understanding the laws of inevitability is precisely our fearless basis!

People can see very clearly that the American imperialists are copying the old tricks of Hitler and Japanese imperialists in everything, and even surpassing Hitler. But it is precisely the experience of the Soviet Union, China, and the just people of the world in killing Hitler and the Japanese imperialists that makes people doubly vigilant, gives people doubled courage, and grasp. Precisely because the laws of history do not allow for the slightest illusion, we must open our eyes to the aggressors' final vicious appearance, and with incomparable heroic fighting and effective work, kill this dying poisonous snake sooner!

    坚决扑灭美国侵略者细菌战的毒焰
    我们誓与美国侵略者斗争到底
    中国红十字会总会
    副会长  熊瑾玎
    卑鄙无耻、绝灭人性的美国侵略者，在中朝人民和全世界人民无比愤怒的抗议下，竟将撒布细菌的范围扩大到我国东北境内。此一野蛮残暴行为，更进一步地揭露了美国侵略者的野心及其垂死挣扎的面貌；也更进一步地显示其日趋毁灭的不可挽救的命运！
    新中国红十字会不能容忍美国侵略者如此疯狂的不顾人道的卑劣行为，我们将继续加强医防服务队的工作，加强支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，加强一切为维护世界和平维护人道主义而斗争的力量，予美国侵略者的兽行以迎头痛击！每一个从事发扬革命人道主义精神的新中国红十字会工作者、每一个从事医疗防疫工作的中国红十字会医防队队员，都将是扑灭美国侵略者细菌战毒焰的顽强战士。我们决不饶过从事于细菌战的主使者和行凶者，对于那些威胁人类安全、污辱人类庄严、破坏人道公约的细菌战凶手们，必须加以严厉的惩罚。我们誓与一切以反人道主义为目的的敌人们斗争到底！
    中国动物学会会员们动员起来粉碎敌人的细菌战
    中国动物学会理事长
    北京大学动物系主任  李汝祺
    灭绝人性的美国侵略者，在强大无比的朝中人民面前，遭到不可挽救的惨败，竟于今年一月十七日，勾结日本细菌战犯，进行细菌战争。并且不顾我国人民和世界爱好和平人民的正义警告，竟变本加厉，于二月二十九至三月五日，仍用大批飞机，将细菌昆虫撒布到我国东北境内。这种丧心病狂的滔天罪行，只能引起我国人民无比的愤恨。
    美帝国主义者自以为有了飞机、大炮、坦克甚至原子弹，就足以横行无阻，独霸世界。但在人民的铁拳下，它是注定要死亡的。就是它现在所用的细菌战，也不能挽救它穷途末日的命运。我们有信心，有决心，能把敌人所撒布的细菌加以彻底扑灭。在这方面，凡是生物学者，都应当积极地动员起来，组织起来，随时准备，响应祖国的号召，走上最需要我们的岗位。
    我愿意代表中国动物学会，号召全国会员一致行动起来，和全国人民一起，采取有效的措施，给美国侵略者的细菌战以有力的回击，粉碎敌人恶毒的阴谋诡计。
    伊斯兰教徒起来声讨美帝国主义的罪行
    北京大学
    东方语文系教授  马坚
    美国侵略军在朝鲜遭受惨败之后，利用手上早已沾染了中朝两国人民鲜血的日本细菌战犯进行各种细菌的试验和制造，并以中朝两国人民部队的被俘人员供他们作试验品。现在，美帝国主义把试验过的各种细菌大量地散布在朝鲜和我国东北境内来进行违背国际公法和世界和平理事会议决案的细菌战。这种灭绝人性的滔天罪行，使我对美帝国主义的憎恨达到了顶点。我控诉美国侵略军的暴行，并且号召全国和全世界的伊斯兰教徒一致声讨美帝国主义的罪恶行为。
    打毒蛇
    冯雪峰
    美国侵略者已经在朝鲜进行着细菌战争，而且用大批飞机侵入我东北，大量撒布细菌，同时滥施轰炸和扫射。
    现在一切都已经明白，这种灭绝人性的细菌战争，是侵略者在千方百计阻挠朝鲜停战谈判的情形之下进行的，尤其这是蓄意已久、长期准备的步骤的实施。在第二次世界大战结束后，美国侵略者就豢养着日本的细菌战犯，秘密研究和制造细菌武器。朝鲜战争开始后，并曾经用朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员作为细菌武器的实验品。而在一九五○年冬季，当它在中朝人民部队反攻之下而狼狈溃退的时候，也已经在平壤和元山一带使用过细菌武器。更要记到的，远在一九二五年，反对细菌战争的日内瓦公约，当时所有大国中不肯批准的，就只有美国和日本。
    但这样，事实就不仅证明，侵略者的穷凶极恶的本性，是与生俱来的；而且也证明，侵略者也早已预料到了自己的失败的一天，因此也早就准备着临末时孤注一掷的最后的手段了。
    不用说，问题就不仅在于侵略者的凶恶的本性，而尤其在于它走近失败的时候，是什么残暴的毁灭手段都会使得出来的。正好比一条毒蛇，它经常危害人，而在它被打得快死时，它就把所有的毒液都从它的牙齿间喷射出来了。
    但是，侵略者自己既已经证明它走近失败和灭亡，那么，我们和全世界人民也就不能不大无畏地正视着它的最后的凶暴的一手！一切都已经被证明为不可避免，则了解不可避免的法则，倒正是我们大无畏的凭据！
    人们看得很清楚，美国帝国主义者没有一件事情不抄希特勒和日本帝国主义者的老文章，而且还超过了希特勒一等。但是，就正是苏联、中国和全世界的正义的人民，打死了希特勒和日本帝国主义者的经验，使人们加倍地知道警惕，使人们有了加倍的勇敢和把握了。也正因为历史的规律，已不容人存丝毫的幻想，我们就必须睁着眼睛对着侵略者最后的凶相，而以无比英勇的战斗和切实有效的工作，早些打死这条临死的毒蛇！
