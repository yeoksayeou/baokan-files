    Hoping Literary and Art Workers Will Create Works Promoting Advanced Agricultural Experiences
    Editor: The 1952 spring plowing is about to begin. This year is a year for us to move towards greater victory. In agriculture, we must strive for a greater harvest. A good harvest mainly relies on increasing yield per unit area. In this regard, many labor models in our country have created amazing results, such as Li Chenggui, a labor model from Liling, Hunan, who produced more than 1,400 catties of rice per mu. However, these experiences have not yet been accepted by the majority of farmers, and many farmers have not even heard of such a thing. Some have heard of it, but because they still have some conservative ideas, they are skeptical of these advanced experiences, so they are unwilling to learn. For example, Tang Mingjiu, secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in Xiaojiangdu Township in our district, said: "Our land here is poor, and we will never be able to harvest so much grain in our lifetime. Their (referring to Li Chenggui) land is better and the area is larger, so they can harvest so much." This kind of conservative thinking is harmful to increasing yield per unit area. I hope that the nation's writers and artists will take advanced experiences as the theme and create popular plays, pamphlets, and comic strips, which will be taken to the countryside by district and township cadres for widespread publicity to break the farmers' conservative thinking and enable them to learn from advanced experiences. Literary figures, artists, district and township cadres of the motherland, let us join hands and work hard for this year's great harvest.

    希望文艺工作者创作宣传农业先进经验的作品
    编辑同志：一九五二年春耕已快开始了。今年是我们走向更大胜利的一年，在农业上，我们要争取更大的丰收。丰收主要是依靠提高单位面积产量。在这方面，我们祖国许多的劳动模范，已创造了惊人的成绩，如湖南醴陵的劳动模范李承桂，每亩产一千四百多斤稻谷。可是，这些经验还没有被广大农民群众所接受，很多农民根本没有听到有这么一回事。有的虽然听到了，但是由于他们还有一些保守思想，对这些先进经验半信半疑，所以不愿意学习。如我区小江渡乡青年团支部书记唐明玖说：“我们这里田坏，一辈子也打不出那么多谷子，他们（指李承桂）那里田好些，面积大些，所以打得出。”这种保守思想对于提高单位面积产量是有害的。我希望全国的文学家、美术家以先进经验为主题，创作通俗的剧本、小册子、连环画，由区乡干部拿到农村去广泛宣传，打破农民的保守思想，使他们学习先进经验。祖国的文学家、美术家、区乡干部，让我们携起手来为今年的大丰收而努力吧。
