    Beijing Architectural Design Company
    Has Inspected the Normal University Affiliated High School Project

    To the Editor: We fully accept the criticisms from comrades Ma Qi and Jiang Shanjing published in the People's Daily, as well as the opinions from the Beijing Experimental Workers and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School regarding our company. It was wrong of us not to have given these problems due attention at the start of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. We have already dispatched personnel to the construction site of the Beijing Normal University Affiliated High School for inspection and have discovered extremely serious instances of cutting corners. Such serious cutting of corners is inseparable from bribery. Our company's Thrift and Economy Inspection Committee has already identified certain personnel connected with this project who have indeed engaged in bribery, and we are currently conducting a thorough investigation of the entire case in conjunction with relevant departments.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京市建筑设计公司
    已对师大附中工程进行检查
    编辑同志：人民日报发表的马奇、江山静同志对我公司的批评及北京实验工农速成中学对我们的意见，我们完全接受。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，我们没有重视这些问题，是错误的。我们已派人到北京师范大学附中工地去检查，发现偷工减料现象十分严重。这样严重的偷工减料是和行贿受贿不可分的。我公司节约检查委员会已查出某些和这一工程有关的人员，确有受贿行为，现正会同各有关部门对全案进行彻查。
