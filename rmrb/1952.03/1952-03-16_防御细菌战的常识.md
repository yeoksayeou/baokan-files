Common Knowledge on Defending Against Bacteriological Warfare
The General Association of Chinese Medical Societies

After suffering heavy losses on the Korean battlefield, American imperialism has recently violated human justice and international law by spreading insects carrying germs and other toxic substances in Korea and northeastern China, engaging in bacteriological warfare. This heinous crime against humanity is absolutely intolerable to our great Chinese people, the Korean people, and the people of the world. We must denounce the American imperialists who are waging bacteriological warfare, and we must unite to crush the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare.

What is "Bacteriological Warfare"?

To understand what bacteriological warfare means, we must first understand what "bacteria" are. "Bacteria" are single-celled microorganisms invisible to the naked eye, only visible under a microscope magnified hundreds or thousands of times. Bacteria come in various shapes, some like small spheres, called "spherical bacteria," some like thin wooden rods, called "bacilli," and some like screws, called "spiral bacteria." There is also something even smaller than "bacteria," not visible under ordinary microscopes, called "filterable viruses." There are many types of bacteria, but only a few are harmful to humans and can make us sick; these are called "pathogenic bacteria." The vast majority of other bacteria cannot make people sick and are called "non-pathogenic bacteria." People get sick because they are infected with "germs" and "viruses."

What is "bacteriological warfare"? Bacteriological warfare is when aggressors artificially cultivate and propagate bacteria, then attach the bacteria to insects or other objects and spread them into the invaded country to create infectious diseases and kill the people of the invaded country. Some bacteria can cause infectious diseases in livestock, leading to mass death; some bacteria and insects can cause diseases and pests in crops, causing them to die completely or not bear fruit. Therefore, bacteriological warfare is a method of warfare that destroys human civilization and violates humanity.

Using bacteria in warfare is not allowed by human justice and international law. For example, on June 17, 1925, representatives of the governments of forty-four countries signed a protocol in Geneva, Switzerland, prohibiting the use of poison gas or similar substances and bacteriological methods in warfare. In November 1950, representatives of people from eighty countries at the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw passed a resolution demanding the unconditional prohibition of all atomic weapons, bacteriological and chemical weapons, poison gas, radioactive weapons, and other instruments of mass destruction, and declared the government that first used these weapons to be a war criminal.

How Aggressors Prepare for Bacteriological Warfare

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japanese fascists committed inhumane bacteriological warfare against the Chinese people. When Japanese invaders occupied our territory, they established many bacterial killing factories in Harbin, Changchun, Anda in Heilongjiang, and other places. The two largest and most heinous of these were called "Unit 731" and "Unit 100." In these bacterial killing factories, Japanese invaders cultivated large quantities of germs and insects carrying infectious diseases, as well as rats, etc., and conducted large-scale research and experimentation. They even inhumanely used living people for experiments. From 1940 to 1945 alone, over 3,000 people sacrificed their lives under experimentation at "Unit 731." In 1940, Japanese invaders used airplanes to drop large quantities of wheat, flour, and millet in Ningbo, Zhejiang. These items contained large numbers of small toxic insects, slightly smaller than ordinary fleas, carrying plague germs. Because the Kuomintang reactionaries did not carry out defensive bacteriological warfare work, this caused the plague to spread in Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi provinces, killing many people. In 1941, Japanese invaders further used airplanes to drop grains, wheat, bean seeds, and cotton, etc., carrying plague bacteria in Changde, Hunan. A week later, dead rats were found in the area, and another week later, there were plague patients. As a result, the plague broke out in Changde and Taoyuan counties. Japanese imperialism also spread plague bacteria in Jinhua, Zhejiang, Inner Mongolia, and other regions. When the Japanese devils surrendered, in order to eliminate evidence, they destroyed bacterial factories and released large numbers of rats and fleas carrying germs, harming many of our compatriots. To this day, we still remember these blood debts clearly.

American imperialism, like the Japanese devils, started preparing for bacteriological warfare very early, and was even more vicious than the Japanese devils. As early as 1943, the U.S. government established the "Biological Warfare Committee" under the Department of the Army and established bacterial killing factories in several places, including Fort Detrick in Maryland, Vigo in Indiana, Pascagoula in Mississippi, and Dugway in Utah, specializing in researching and manufacturing large quantities of harmful infectious disease bacteria. After World War II, American imperialism, intent on launching wars of aggression, not only did not, like the Soviet Union, try the German and Japanese fascist bacteriological war criminals, but also used Japanese and German fascist bacteriological war criminals to help them manufacture bacteriological weapons.

In order to conduct bacteriological warfare in the Far East, the United States colluded with Japanese bacteriological war criminals and established a "Central Headquarters" for Japanese bacteriological warfare research work in Tokyo. In order to test the killing effectiveness of bacteriological weapons, American imperialists have more than once used living people as experimental subjects, losing all conscience. The most heinous and brutal was using captured personnel from our Chinese and Korean People's Armies for experiments. Last March, a U.S. military Landing Craft Bacteria No. 1091 secretly sailed to Wonsan Port in Korea, using captured personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for bacteriological experiments. Furthermore, according to the confession of an American reactionary journalist who saw it with his own eyes: Last year, American imperialism conducted large-scale experiments on captured personnel from the Korean People's Army on Geoje Island in southern Korea. Eighty percent of the more than 125,000 captured personnel on the island were infected with diseases, many of whom were very ill. This is truly inhumane to the extreme!

As for the American imperialists spreading poisonous bacteria to harm people, this has happened more than once. In 1950, American imperialism spread potato beetles in the German Democratic Republic to damage the crops of the German Democratic Republic. After being defeated by the Chinese and Korean People's Armies in Korea, the United States wanted to use bacteria to salvage its defeat. When the American invading army retreated from northern Korea in 1950, it spread smallpox bacteria there. Seven or eight days later, many people developed smallpox. By April 1951, the number of people with smallpox reached more than 3,500, of whom more than 300 died at their poisonous hands. Recently, the American aggressors have intensified and blatantly used bacteriological warfare. From January 28th of this year, the American invading army has continuously used airplanes and artillery to spread germs on the front lines and in the rear in Korea. From February 29th, the American invading army frantically dispatched large numbers of airplanes to spread bacteria in northeastern China.

The things dropped by the American aggressors from airplanes include fleas, flies, mosquitoes, ants, spiders, lice, crickets, sandflies, and some small insects never seen locally, all carrying germs, as well as rats, chicken feathers, cotton, and leaves carrying germs. Some of these things were dropped directly, some were dropped in containers such as paper packages, paper tubes, cloth bags, and wooden boxes, and some were dropped in bombs. In addition, there is a type of bacteriological bomb that contains insects, cotton, chicken feathers, etc. carrying bacteria. The enemy wants to use appropriate climatic conditions to allow the germs to multiply and cause epidemics to kill the people and armies of China and Korea, as well as livestock, domestic animals, and crops. This heinous crime of American imperialism has aroused unanimous anger and condemnation from the Chinese and Korean people and has been met with condemnation and protests from the people of the world.

Bacteriological Warfare Can Be Defended Against

The American bandits' bacteriological warfare, like their airplanes and artillery, cannot save them from defeat. Because what determines the outcome of war is not weapons, but the people who wield them. The war of aggression waged by American imperialism is opposed by the people of the world and is increasingly unsupported by the people of their own country. Furthermore, bacteriological warfare can be completely defended against.

We know that the insects and other toxic substances carrying bacteria spread by the enemy can be eliminated, and human epidemics can be prevented. We vaccinate and get shots every year to prevent smallpox and avoid typhoid and cholera. Doctors and nurses are in contact with infectious patients every day, and microbiology researchers live around bacteria and parasites all day long, yet they can still avoid infection and stay healthy. This is the reason.

More importantly, with the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we can defeat any of the enemy's weapons, and we can also defeat the enemy's bacteriological warfare weapons. In the past, under the Kuomintang reactionaries, the reactionary government did not care about the life or death of the people, and epidemic prevention was just a formality, so epidemics spread more and more fiercely. After liberation, the situation is very different. The people and the People's Government are united, and many infectious diseases have been brought under control. For example, the plague that was prevalent in Northeast China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region around 1949 was quickly extinguished by the broad masses of the people under the leadership of the People's Government and with the help of Soviet experts. The encephalitis that was prevalent near Dalian was also quickly prevented through the efforts of the broad masses of the people. Cholera, which used to be rampant, has not occurred in the three years since liberation. This shows that the Chinese people, who have stood up, are an invincible force under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party!

What Work Should We Do?

First, we must mobilize all propaganda forces to widely publicize to the masses. Explain that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people of the world, mobilize everyone to strengthen all aspects of work, support the front lines, and strike American imperialism even harder. Publicize that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, can defeat bacteriological warfare; publicize the common sense of hygiene for defending against bacteriological warfare, and overcome the fear or paralysis that may arise among the masses.

Second, we must organize the masses and raise vigilance. Guard against counter-revolutionary elements taking the opportunity to engage in activities, spread rumors, or spread poisonous insects or toxic substances. Organize mass surveillance networks. Once enemy aircraft are discovered spreading poisonous insects or other things, report it to the local health department or air defense agency for emergency handling. Do not approach them yourself to avoid danger.

Third, strengthen epidemic prevention agencies and organize epidemic prevention training classes to train activists among the masses. Everyone should actively learn common knowledge about epidemic prevention.

Fourth, do a good job in preventive vaccination. Everyone should respond to the call of the People's Government and go to the health department for vaccinations.

Fifth, do a good job in environmental sanitation and personal hygiene. Everyone should take action, and every household should be mobilized to clean the streets and houses and not allow fleas and lice to have a place to hide. Remove sewage, clean up garbage at any time, and kill flies and mosquitoes. Catch rats frequently and block rat holes. Whether adults or children, do not eat raw or cold food and do not drink raw water to avoid gastrointestinal infectious diseases. In addition, bathe often, change clothes frequently, improve your health, and strengthen your resistance.

Strive to Crush the American Aggressors' Bacteriological Warfare

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the Chinese people defeated domestic and foreign enemies and established a new China; the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front, together with the Korean People's Army, defeated the American aggressors and their accomplice bandit armies. Our Chinese people are heroic people who can defeat any enemy. American imperialism's spreading of bacteria is not because it is strong, but because it has been defeated by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army and is in a state of utter disarray. In order to salvage its military defeat, it has resorted to this inhumane method that violates international law. But this method also cannot save it from defeat. The people of the whole country must mobilize, support the front lines, do a good job in defense, and strive to crush the American plot to expand bacteriological warfare!

    防御细菌战的常识
    中华医学会总会
    美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上遭到惨重的失败以后，最近竟违反人类正义和国际公法在朝鲜和我国东北地区撒布带有病菌的昆虫和其他毒物，进行细菌战。这种灭绝人性的滔天罪行，是我们伟大的中国人民、朝鲜人民和全世界人民所绝对不能容忍的。我们一定要声讨进行细菌战的美帝国主义者，我们一定要团结起来粉碎美国侵略者的细菌战。
    什么叫“细菌战”
    要了解细菌战是什么意思，首先应当了解什么是“细菌”。“细菌”是肉眼所不能见到的一种单细胞的微小的生物，要在显微镜下放大几百倍或一千倍以上才能看见。细菌的形状有好几种，有的像小圆球，就叫做“球状细菌”，有的像细木杆，就叫做“杆状细菌”，有的像螺丝，就叫做“螺旋状细菌”。另外还有一种比“细菌”还小的东西，在普通显微镜下还不能看到它，称为“滤过性病毒”。细菌的种类繁多，其中有少数细菌对我们人类是有害的，能使我们得病，就叫做“致病菌”；其他绝大多数细菌是不能使人致病的，就叫做“非致病菌”。人所以生病，就是因为传染了“病菌”、“病毒”的结果。
    什么叫“细菌战”呢？细菌战就是侵略者用人工的方法来培养和繁殖细菌，然后把细菌附在昆虫或其他东西上面撒布到被侵略的国家，来制造传染病、杀害被侵略国家的人民。有的细菌可使牲口得传染病，大批死亡；有的细菌和虫类可使庄稼受病虫害，全部死去或者不结果实。因此细菌战是毁灭人类文明，违反人道的作战方法。
    用细菌来作战是人类正义和国际公法所不容许的。例如，一九二五年六月十七日，四十四个国家政府的代表在瑞士的日内瓦，就签订了一个议定书，禁止用毒气或类似毒品及细菌方法作战。一九五○年十一月，八十个国家人民的代表在华沙举行的第二届世界保卫和平大会，通过了决议，要求无条件禁止各种原子武器、细菌和化学武器、毒气、放射性武器以及其他大规模毁灭人类的工具，并宣布首先使用这些武器的政府为战争罪犯。
    侵略者是怎样准备细菌战的
    在抗日战争时期中，日本法西斯就曾经对中国人民进行过惨无人道的细菌战。日本侵略者在侵占我国领土时，曾在哈尔滨、长春、黑龙江的安达等地方，成立许多细菌杀人工厂。其中规模最大、罪恶最重的两个叫做“七三一部队”和“一○○部队”。日本侵略者在这些细菌杀人工厂中大量地培养病菌和传染病菌的昆虫、老鼠等，进行大规模的研究试验工作。他们更惨无人道地用活人来做实验，从一九四○年到一九四五年，仅在“七三一部队”实验下牺牲的就有三千多人。一九四○年日本侵略者曾用飞机在浙江宁波撒下大批小麦、面粉和粟。这些东西里头有大批比普通跳蚤略小的小毒虫，带有鼠疫病菌。因为当时国民党反动派不进行防御细菌战的工作，以致造成浙江、福建、江西三省鼠疫流行，死了好多人。一九四一年日本侵略者更进一步地在湖南的常德，用飞机撒下带有鼠疫细菌的谷、麦、豆粒和棉花等东西。一星期后这一带就发现死老鼠，再过一星期就有鼠疫病人，结果在常德和桃源两县流行开了鼠疫。日本帝国主义也曾在浙江金华、内蒙古等地区撒布过鼠疫病菌。日寇投降时，它为了消灭罪证，破坏了细菌工厂，放出了大批带有病菌的老鼠、跳蚤，又害了我国的许多同胞。直到今天，这些血债，在我们脑子里还是记得很清楚的。
    美帝国主义和日本鬼子一样，很早就开始细菌战的准备工作，而且比日本鬼子更毒。早在一九四三年，美国政府就在陆军部下面设立了“生物作战委员会”，并且在马利兰州的狄特里克兵营、印第安州的伐哥、密士失必州的巴斯古拉、犹他州的德格威等好几个地方，设立了细菌杀人工厂，专门研究和制造大批害人的传染病细菌。第二次世界大战结束后，存心发动侵略战争的美帝国主义不但没有像苏联一样，审判德日法西斯的细菌战犯，它更利用日本和德国法西斯细菌战犯来帮助他们制造细菌武器。
    为了在远东进行细菌战，美国又和日本细菌战犯勾结一起，在东京成立了日本细菌战研究工作的“中央总部”。美帝国主义者为了试验细菌武器的杀人效力，曾经不止一次丧尽天良地用活人来做实验品。其中最凶恶残暴的是把我们中朝人民军队的被俘人员做试验。去年三月，美军的一只第一○九一号细菌登陆艇，曾秘密开到朝鲜元山港，把中国人民志愿军被俘人员做细菌试验。又据亲眼看到的美国反动记者自己供认：去年美帝国主义在朝鲜南部巨济岛上，把朝鲜人民军被俘人员做大规模试验，岛上十二万五千多被俘人员中，百分之八十都传染上了疾病，其中有许多人病得很厉害。这真是惨无人道到了极点！
    至于美帝国主义撒布毒菌害人，也已不止一次了。一九五○年，美帝国主义就曾在德意志民主共和国撒布马铃薯甲虫，来损害德意志民主共和国的农作物，美国在朝鲜被中朝人民部队打败以后，便想用细菌来挽救它的失败。当一九五○年美国侵略军从朝鲜北部败退时，就曾将天花细菌撒布在那里，七八天后就有很多人生了天花病，到一九五一年四月，出天花的达到三千五百多人，其中三百多人在他们的毒手下死去。最近美国侵略者更变本加厉明目张胆地使用细菌战。从今年一月二十八日起，美国侵略军接连地在朝鲜前线和后方用飞机和大炮撒布病菌。从二月二十九日起，美国侵略军又疯狂地出动大批飞机在我国东北地区撒布细菌。
    美国侵略者从飞机上投下来的东西有带有病菌的跳蚤、苍蝇、蚊子、蚂蚁、蜘蛛、虱子、蟋蟀、白蛉子和一些当地从未见过的小虫子，也有带有病菌的老鼠、鸡毛、棉花和树叶等。这些东西有的是直接撒下来的，有的是装在纸包、纸筒、布包、木箱等容器内投下来的，有的是装在炸弹内投下来的。此外，还有一种细菌炮弹，里面装有带有细菌的昆虫、棉花、鸡毛等，敌人想利用适当的气候条件，使病菌繁殖起来造成疫病，来杀害中朝两国人民和军队以及牲口、家畜和庄稼等。美帝国主义的这种滔天罪行，已引起中朝人民的一致愤怒声讨，已遭到了全世界人民的斥责和抗议。
    细菌战是可以防御的
    美国强盗进行细菌战和它的飞机大炮一样是不能挽救它的失败的。因为决定战争胜负的不是武器，而是掌握武器的人。美帝国主义进行的侵略战争遭受到全世界人民的反对，并且越来越得不到他们国家人民的支持。再说，细菌战是完全可以防御的。
    我们知道，敌人所撒布的带有细菌的昆虫和其他毒物，是可以消灭的；而且人类的疫病也是可以预防的。我们每年种牛痘、打防疫针，就是为了防止天花，不害伤寒、霍乱。医生护士每天和传染病人接触，微生物研究者整天生活在细菌和寄生虫周围，仍然可以避免传染，保持健康，就是这个道理。
    更重要的是，我们有毛主席、共产党的领导，我们就能够战胜敌人的任何武器，也能够战胜敌人的细菌战武器。从前在国民党反动派时候，反动政府不管人民死活，防疫是官样文章，所以疫病蔓延也就愈来愈凶。解放以后，情形就大大不同了。人民和人民政府打成一片，许多传染病都得到了控制。例如一九四九年前后东北和内蒙自治区流行的鼠疫，广大人民在人民政府领导下和苏联专家的帮助下，很快地扑灭了。大连附近流行过的大脑炎也在广大人民的努力下很快地防止了。过去常常大流行的霍乱，解放以后三年来就没有发生过。这就说明了：站起来了的中国人民，在毛主席、共产党的领导下，是一支永远不可战胜的力量！
    我们应该做些什么工作
    第一，我们要动员一切宣传力量，广泛地向群众宣传。说明美帝国主义是中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的死敌，动员大家加强各方面的工作，支援前线，更沉重地打击美帝国主义。宣传中国人民在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，细菌战是可以战胜的；宣传防御细菌战的卫生常识，克服群众中可能产生的恐惧或麻痹思想。
    第二，要把群众组织起来，提高警惕。防备反革命分子乘机活动、造谣、散布毒虫或毒物。组织群众性的监视网，一发现敌机撒布毒虫或其他东西，就报告当地卫生机关或防空机关，紧急处理，自己不要接近，以免危险。
    第三，要加强防疫机构，组织防疫训练班，训练群众中的积极分子。大家应该积极学习防疫常识。
    第四，要做好预防注射工作。大家都要响应人民政府号召，到卫生机关去打防疫针。
    第五，要搞好环境卫生和个人卫生工作。人人动手，户户动员，把街道、房屋打扫干净，不让跳蚤、虱子有躲藏的地方。除去污水，随时清除垃圾，扑灭苍蝇和蚊子。勤捕老鼠，堵死鼠洞。无论大人小孩，都不要吃生冷食品，不喝生水，这样可以避免肠胃传染病。此外，更要常洗澡，勤换衣服，增进身体健康，增强抵抗力。
    为粉碎美国侵略者的细菌战而斗争
    中国人民在毛主席和共产党领导下，战胜了国内外敌人，建立了新中国；在朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军，和朝鲜人民军一起，打败了美国侵略者及其帮凶的强盗军队。我们中国人民是英雄的人民，是能够战胜任何敌人的。美帝国主义撒布细菌，不是因为他强大，而是被中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军打得落花流水，它为了挽救其军事失败，才使出这种灭绝人性、违反国际公法的办法。但这个办法也同样不能挽救它的失败。全国人民要动员起来，支援前线，做好防御工作，为粉碎美国扩大细菌战的阴谋而斗争！
