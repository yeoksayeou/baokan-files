Dear Chairman Mao: We, one thousand two hundred and ninety-two people, are cadres, model workers, and activists from thirty-four administrative villages in the first district of Licheng County, Shanxi. Under the leadership of the District Committee and District Government of the Chinese Communist Party, we held a drought prevention and spring ploughing meeting on March 1st. We enthusiastically discussed drought prevention and spring ploughing work and formulated specific action plans.

Before attending this meeting, although we had already begun to lead the masses in production in the villages, we always thought in our minds: "It's the same every year, just do it as usual." After this meeting, our awareness has been raised, and we have realized that drought prevention and resistance is the guarantee for completing this year's high-yield task, and it is also a major issue related to increasing production and practicing economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and ensuring the future construction of the country. Although this task is arduous, we have the confidence to complete it. We have decided to launch a patriotic high-yield competition with farmers in various regions and strive to make our district a model district for effectively preventing drought, resisting drought, and preparing for spring ploughing. Our plan is as follows:

	I.	Ideologically mobilize the masses fully to make them realize the significance of patriotic high-yield and to strengthen their confidence in "Man can conquer nature"; ensure that 95% of the farmers in the district are organized. Require the emergence of three model high-yield villages, sixty model high-yield mutual aid teams, one hundred and sixty model high-yield households, and one thousand one hundred and forty-six mu of high-yield land throughout the district. The overall requirement is to increase production by 2.6 million jin of millet.

	II.	In order to do a good job in drought prevention, in addition to the existing wells, ponds, and channels, 173 new wells will be dug, 196 old wells will be repaired, 109 water storage ponds will be dug, and 282 channels will be opened, so that 2,538 mu of land in the district can be irrigated.

	III.	In order to ensure that each person has one to one and a half mu of moisture-conserving land, each piece of land should be double-harrowed twice and raked twice to maintain the soil's moisture.

	IV.	In order to change the rough farming methods, we plan to mobilize farmers to purchase 21 seven-inch and five-inch plows, 37 various weeding hoes, 59 double-legged seed drills, 11 sprayers, and 7 waterwheels.

	V.	In order to increase the yield per unit area, 35 to 40 loads of fertilizer will be applied to each mu of land this year, and it is guaranteed that wheat fields will be universally hoed once shallowly, and 50% will be top-dressed and irrigated. In addition, 2,158 mu of soil will be improved, weeds in the fields will be burned, and the field ridges will be universally repaired once.

	VI.	Prepare all seeds well, especially prepare some early-maturing, late-planting, and drought-resistant seeds to meet the needs of different situations.

	VII.	Areas near the mountains in the district should close off mountains for afforestation on 1,178 mu. Each person should also guarantee to plant and keep alive three trees, so that 59,400 trees can be planted.

	VIII.	The district is expected to increase 53 livestock this year, promote livestock insurance for 387 livestock, and all livestock will be vaccinated. In addition, we have also stipulated in the plan: to strengthen preferential treatment work, to ensure that the farmland of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers' families also achieve high yields, and to ensure that they do not feel difficulties in life and production.

In order to realize the above plan, in addition to relying on the strong leadership of the Party branch and the People's Government, giving full play to the exemplary role of Party members, members of the Youth League and cadres, establishing drought prevention and spring ploughing production committees in each village to lead each group and household to formulate specific plans and revise patriotic covenants, we have also jointly stipulated: everyone should actively lead the masses to carry out drought prevention and preparation for spring ploughing, and not be passively slackened because of the "Three-Anti" movement to be carried out in the countryside in the future; those who have corrupt behavior are not allowed to burn receipts, forge accounts, and form "offensive and defensive alliances", and strive to atone for their crimes by making contributions in drought prevention and preparation for spring ploughing.

With respect!
The Drought Prevention and Spring Ploughing Meeting of Male and Female Cadres, Model Workers, and Activists in the First District of Licheng County, Shanxi Province
(Drafters: Jia Keqin, Wang You, Wang Shuxun, Niu Shiliu)
We dug 700 wells in the drought prevention and resistance movement, eliminating all dry land in the district.

Respected Chairman Mao:
In order to respond to the call to increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and carry out the drought prevention and resistance movement, more than 50,000 people in our district are launching a vigorous drought prevention and resistance movement under the leadership of the People's Government.

Our district has a total of 33,269 mu of dry land, accounting for 26% of the total cultivated area. In the drought prevention and resistance movement, we are determined to eliminate all dry land and turn it all into irrigated land. We will increase the yield by 70 jin per mu from the original 80 jin of seed cotton per mu of dry land, in order to complete the task of producing 2 million jin of cotton (equivalent to 6 million jin of grain) in the district.

In the drought prevention and resistance movement, every village has formed a drought resistance headquarters. Under the leadership of the drought resistance headquarters, mutual aid organizations such as well-digging mutual aid groups, contracting groups, technical guidance groups, and well-digging groups for cultivation on behalf of others have been formed. Some villages have established "volunteer support teams" to dig wells for isolated elderly households in need of labor. Digging wells requires a lot of money, but we did not simply wait for government loans. We tore down the brick screen walls at the door, and things made of brick but which could be replaced with adobe (such as chicken coop walls) were torn down and replaced with adobe. In order to adjust the material difficulties in digging wells, every village has established a "well-digging credit cooperative." Everyone is willing to send their surplus and possible money and materials to the cooperative.

Organizing mutual aid for well-digging solved the difficulty of lacking labor. Organizing credit cooperatives solved most of the material difficulties. Therefore, in the 20-odd days of the drought prevention and resistance battle, we have victoriously completed the construction of 700 wells (including the repair of 105 old wells), plus the expansion of the irrigation area of the original 1,600 old wells, which can completely eliminate all the dry land in the district to ensure the completion of this year's high-yield task of 2 million jin of cotton (6 million jin of grain).

We deeply experienced that class struggle against landlords must be united and helped each other; in the drought prevention and resistance well-digging movement, the struggle against nature must also be united and helped each other to win. We have a deeper experience that only under your leadership can the farmers of the world truly become a family, and only under your wise leadership can difficulties be overcome. You are victory, you are everything. We wish you good health.
The entire farmers of the First District of Xingtai County, Hebei Province.
I am a Glorious Military Family Member, Determined to Take the Lead in Doing a Good Job in Production in This Great Era.

Dear Chairman Mao:
I am a glorious military family member from Maozhuang Village, Seventh District, Gaocheng County, Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province. Last year, I was selected as a first-class labor model in the county. This year, I am 67 years old. In order to strengthen the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, I actively participated in the patriotic high-yield and drought prevention and resistance movement. I organized a land production cooperative. Now, there are a total of seven households participating in this cooperative, with a total of 130 mu of land, 7 livestock, and 8 laborers. After discussion by all members of the cooperative: "Land and livestock are divided into the cooperative; labor is calculated according to busyness and leisure - 10 points are counted for each labor when busy, and 5 points are counted for each labor when idle." Everyone feels that this kind of clear labor accounting system is the fairest and most reasonable. Everyone also unanimously agreed: "Our usual life should maintain the living standard of a middle peasant, in order to accumulate funds, purchase new agricultural tools, and lay the foundation for moving towards collective farms."

We have already formulated high-yield and increased-production plans.

In order to guarantee the realization of the high-yield and increased-production plans, we must mobilize everyone to immediately launch a fertilizer accumulation movement and a canal inspection and repair movement, strengthen drought prevention and resistance work, and strive to organize all the land before the Qingming Festival, to ensure on-time sowing.

In the great era under your leadership, I am the most glorious military family member. I have sent three of my four sons to the front lines to defend the motherland. All the production labor at home depends on me. I am inspired by the letters from my sons and this beautiful society. I do not feel like an old woman in her sixties at all in labor, nor do I feel tired. At the same time, the leaders and villagers in our village are also very considerate to my family. Our whole family is well-fed and clothed, with no difficulties or shortages. Please rest assured! My urgent wish is to lead the people of our cooperative and village to do a good job in production.

Wishing you good health!
Li Xiangrong, a First-Class Labor Model from Maozhuang, Seventh District, Gaocheng County, Hebei Province.

    向毛主席保证作好防旱抗旱和春耕工作
    黎城一区千余干部、劳动模范、积极分子报告防旱备耕计划，决心争取成为丰产模范区
    亲爱的毛主席：我们一千二百九十二个人是山西黎城县一区三十四个行政村的干部、劳动模范和积极分子。我们在中共区委和区政府领导下，三月一日举行了防旱备耕大会，我们热烈地讨论了防旱和春耕工作，并订出了具体行动计划。
    我们在没有参加这个大会以前，虽然已开始在村里领导群众进行生产，但是在思想上总是认为：年年如此，照例进行就是了。经过这次会议，我们的觉悟提高了，认识了防旱抗旱是完成今年丰产任务的保证，而且是关系着增产节约支持中国人民志愿军和保证今后把国家建设好的大问题。这个任务虽然艰巨，但是我们有信心来完成它。我们决定和各地农民展开爱国丰产竞赛，争取我们这个区成为防旱抗旱切实做好春耕准备工作的模范区。我们的计划是：
    一、从思想上充分发动群众，使群众认识爱国丰产意义和坚定“人定胜天”的信心；保证把全区百分之九十五的农户组织起来。要求全区出现三个模范丰产村、六十个丰产模范互助组、一百六十个丰产模范户和一千一百四十六亩丰产地。总的要求是增产二百六十万斤小米。
    二、为了做好防旱工作，除了原有水井、水池、渠道外，要增打水井一百七十三眼，修理旧井一百九十六眼，掘蓄水池一百零九个，开渠二百八十二道，这样就可以使全区二千五百三十八亩地得到浇灌。
    三、为了保证每人有一亩到一亩半保墒地，每块地要双耙两次，耢两次，以保持地的底墒。
    四、为了改变粗糙的耕作方法，我们准备动员农民购买七寸、五寸步犁二十一部，各式耘锄三十七部，两腿耧五十九部，喷雾器十一个和水车七部。
    五、为了提高单位面积产量，今年每亩地施肥三十五驮到四十驮，并保证麦地要普遍浅锄一次，有百分之五十上追肥、浇水。此外还要改良土壤二千一百五十八亩，并烧掉田间杂草，普修边堰一次。
    六、要准备好一切种籽，特别准备一部早熟、晚种和抗旱的种籽，以适应不同情况的需要。
    七、全区靠山的地区要封山育林一千一百七十八亩。每人并保证栽活三棵树，这样可以植树五万九千四百株。
    八、全区预计今年增加牲畜五十三头，推广牲畜保险三百八十七头，全部牲畜都实行防疫注射。此外我们还在计划中规定：加强优抚工作，保证革命烈士、革命军人家属的耕地同样丰产，保证他们在生活、生产中不感困难。
    我们为了实现上项计划，除了依靠党支部和人民政府的坚强领导，发挥党、团员和干部积极带头作用，在各村成立防旱抗旱春耕生产委员会，领导各组各户订出具体计划，修订爱国公约外，我们还共同规定：大家都要积极领导群众进行防旱、备耕工作，不因今后要在农村进行“三反”运动而消极懈怠；有贪污行为的不许焚毁单据、伪造账目和订立“攻守同盟”，争取在防旱备耕中立功赎罪。
    此致敬礼！山西省黎城一区男女干部、劳动模范、积极分子防旱备耕大会（代笔人贾克勤、王有、王树勋、牛世六）我们在防旱抗旱运动中打井七百眼，消灭了全区旱地敬爱的毛主席：为了响应增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军和开展防旱抗旱运动的号召，我们全区五万多人正在人民政府领导下开展着热火朝天的防旱抗旱运动。
    我们全区共有旱地三万三千二百六十九亩，占总耕地面积的百分之二十六。在防旱抗旱运动中，我们决心消灭所有旱地，使它全部变成水地。我们要在原来每亩旱地只产八十斤籽棉的基础上，每亩增产七十斤，以完成全区丰产二百万斤棉花的任务（合六百万斤粮食）。
    在防旱抗旱运动中，我们村村都组成了抗旱指挥部。在抗旱指挥部领导下，又组成了打井互助组、包工组、技术指导组、代耕打井组等互助组织。有的村成立了“志愿支援队”，给缺乏劳力的孤寡困难户打井。打井需要很多钱，可是我们并没有单纯等待政府贷款。我们把门口的砖影壁拆掉，把用砖做成的但是也可以用坯代替的东西（如鸡窝墙头等）拆掉，用坯代替；为了调剂打井中的物资困难，村村又都成立了“打井信贷合作社”。大家都肯把自己多余的和可能抽出来的钱财、物力送到合作社中去。
    组织打井互助，解决了缺乏劳力的困难。组织信贷合作社，又解决了大部分物质上的困难。因此在二十多天的防旱抗旱的战斗中，我们已胜利完成了七百眼井的建设（包括修理一百零五眼旧井在内），再加扩大原来一千六百眼旧井的灌溉面积，完全可以彻底消灭全区所有的旱地，以保证今年二百万斤棉花（六百万斤粮食）的丰产任务的完成。
    我们深深地体验到：向地主进行阶级斗争，必须团结互助；在防旱、抗旱打井运动中，向自然斗争，也必须团结互助，才能胜利。我们更深刻地体验到只有在您的领导下，天下农民才真正成了一家，只有在您的英明领导下，才能克服困难。您就是胜利，您就是一切。敬祝您的身体健康    河北省邢台县一区全体农民我是一个光荣的军属在这伟大的时代决心带头搞好生产亲爱的毛主席：我是河北省石家庄专区藁城县七区毛庄村的光荣军属，去年被选为本县的一等劳动模范；我今年已经六十七岁。我为了加强抗美援朝的力量，积极参加了爱国丰产和防旱抗旱运动。我组织了一个土地生产合作社。现在参加这个社的共有七户，合计土地一百三十亩；牲口七头；劳力八个。经本社全体人员的讨论：“土地、牲口按分入社；劳力计工依忙闲而变——忙时每个劳力按十分计，闲时每个劳力按五分计。”这样的清工计工制，大家都感到最公平最合理。大家并且一致同意：“我们平时的生活，要保持中农的生活程度，以便积累资金，购买新式农具，打下走向集体农庄的基础”。
    我们已经订出了丰产和增产计划。
    我们为了保证实现丰产及增产计划，一定要发动大家马上展开一个积肥运动及检渠修渠运动，加强防旱抗旱的工作，并争取在清明节前把所有的地都整理好，保证准时下种。
    在您领导的伟大的时代，我是一个最光荣的军属。我已把我四个儿子中的三个都送到了保卫祖国的最前线。家里的一切生产劳动，全靠我来担当。我被我儿子们的来信及这美好的社会鼓舞着，在劳动上一点也不感觉自己是一个六十多岁的老妇人，更不感觉劳累。同时上级和本村的老乡们，对我家的照顾也很周到，我们全家老少都是丰衣足食的，什么困难也没有，什么东西都不缺。希望您放心吧！我的迫切的愿望，就是以身作则，带动本社、本村人民把生产搞好。
    敬祝您身体健康
