    Workers at Xizhimen Train Repair Depot
    Save Over 100 Million Yuan for the Nation in February
    To the Editor: In the anti-corruption movement, workers at the Xizhimen Train Repair Depot actively "fight tigers" and actively produce. Some workers said, "While we fight 'tigers,' let's not forget production." Some workers who did not participate in the "tiger" hunt said, "You ensure that the 'tigers' are caught, and we ensure that production is increased and no accidents occur." Due to the unprecedented increase in workers' patriotic enthusiasm, they overfulfilled the plan in February, preventing more than 30 accidents such as burning axles and internal damage to air ducts, and shortened the time for inspecting and repairing vehicles. According to statistics, the total station stop time was reduced by more than 10,200 minutes throughout the month, saving the country a total of 142.2 million yuan.

    西直门列车检修所工人
    二月份为国家节省一亿多元
    编辑同志：在反贪污运动中，西直门列车检修所工人积极打“虎”，积极生产。有的工人说：“咱们打‘老虎’，可别忘了生产。”有些没参加打“虎”的工人说：“你们保证打住‘老虎’，我们保证提高生产，不出事故。”由于工人们爱国主义热情空前提高，他们在二月份超额完成了计划，防止了燃轴、风管内部破坏等事故三十多件，并缩短了检车修车的时间。据统计，全月因此可缩短停站时间一万零二百多分钟，共给国家节省了一亿四千二百万元。   吴祥
