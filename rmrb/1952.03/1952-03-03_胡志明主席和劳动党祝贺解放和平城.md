Xinhua News Agency, 1st - According to the Vietnam News Agency: President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Central Executive Committee of the Vietnam Lao Dong Party, and the National Committee of the Lien Viet Front, respectively sent telegrams to the Vietnam People's Army troops on the Hoa Binh front and all personnel participating in the battle, congratulating them on the liberation of Hoa Binh City.

    In his telegram, President Ho Chi Minh first, on behalf of the Vietnamese Government, extended warm congratulations to the Front Command, all cadres of the People's Army and front-line government agencies, all soldiers of the People's Army main force, local forces, assault teams, and guerrillas, workers in the military sector, and local people who supported the army. President Ho Chi Minh pointed out: "This victory was achieved due to correct leadership and the unity and concerted efforts of our military and people. I hope that our cadres, soldiers, and people will not be conceited and complacent because of the victory, and will not underestimate the enemy." President Ho Chi Minh said: "The recent victory is a considerable victory. This victory demonstrates the new progress of our army and has brought shameful defeat to the enemy's attempt to first consolidate their defensive positions and then launch an offensive. Our army must constantly compete with each other in killing the enemy and completing tasks, and strive to learn in the process of ideological transformation. Our people must launch active competition in increasing production in order to achieve greater victories."
    The congratulatory telegram from the Central Executive Committee of the Lao Dong Party pointed out: This victory is not only an important victory militarily but also politically because the Vietnam People's Army not only annihilated many enemy troops but also shattered the aggressors' plot to divide the Vietnamese people and made the situation of the French invading forces even more dangerous and difficult. This victory clearly shows that the People's Army has made rapid progress after several offensives and ideological transformation movements. The congratulatory telegram called on the entire army to always maintain vigilance and be prepared to crush any new enemy offensives.
    The congratulatory telegram from the National Committee of the Lien Viet Front pointed out: The victory of Hoa Binh City not only makes all the Vietnamese people happy but also encourages the people of Laos and Cambodia and is valued by peace defenders around the world. The congratulatory telegram hopes that the Vietnam People's Army will achieve greater success in the future ideological transformation movement and continue to expand the victory on the Hoa Binh front, thereby creating conditions for achieving military superiority on the main fronts and achieving greater victories in 1952.

    胡志明主席和劳动党祝贺解放和平城
    【新华社一日讯】据越南通讯社消息：越南民主共和国主席胡志明、越南劳动党中央执行委员会和越南国民联合战线全国委员会，分别致电和平前线的越南人民军部队和所有参加战斗的工作人员，祝贺解放和平城。
    胡志明主席在电文中首先代表越南人民政府向前线司令部，向人民军和前线政府机构的所有干部，向人民军主力部队、地方部队、突击队和游击队的全体战士们，向军事部门的工人和支援了军队的当地人民，致以热诚的祝贺。胡志明主席指出：“这次胜利是由于有正确的领导以及我们军民的团结一致和同心协力而取得的。我希望我们的干部、战士和人民不要因胜利而感到自负自满，不要轻敌。”胡志明主席说：“最近的胜利是一次相当大的胜利。这次胜利说明了我们军队的新的进步，并使敌人在企图先巩固他们的防御阵地然后发动进攻时，蒙受了可耻的失败。我们的军队必须在杀敌和完成工作上不断地互相竞赛，在思想改造过程中努力学习，我们的人民必须在增加生产方面展开积极的竞赛，以取得更大的胜利。”
    劳动党中央执行委员会的贺电中指出：这次胜利不但在军事上、而且在政治上也是一个重要的胜利，因为越南人民军不但歼灭了许多敌军，同时也粉碎了侵略者企图分裂越南人民的阴谋，并使法国侵略军的处境更为危险和困难。这次胜利清楚地表明了人民军在经过几次攻势和思想改造运动以后已有迅速的进步。贺电号召全军经常保持警惕，准备粉碎敌人的任何新的进攻。
    越南国民联合战线全国委员会的贺电指出：和平城的胜利不仅使全越南人民感到欢欣，而且也鼓舞了寮国和高棉的人民，并且受到全世界和平保卫者的重视。贺电希望越南人民军在未来的思想改造运动中获得更大的成就，并继续扩大和平前线的胜利，从而创造条件，争取在主要战线上取得军事优势，并在一九五二年中获得更大的胜利。
