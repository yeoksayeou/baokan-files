Economic Life Brief Commentary

    People's Banks in various regions should closely coordinate rural financial operations with drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing production
    All parts of the country are currently engaged in the intense work of drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing production. People's Banks in various regions must closely coordinate with this work, actively support the agricultural production front, and strive for the smooth completion of this year's agricultural production increase tasks.
    In carrying out rural financial operations, some banks emphasize in general terms "No new loans without repayment of old loans." There is no doubt that state loans must be repaid. Defaulting on state loans without reason is harmful to the country and the people, and is illegal. However, the inability to repay loans on time often occurs among farmers in disaster-stricken areas who have suffered more severely; banks should give necessary consideration to the difficulties of these farmers when making loans. It is incorrect to implement "No new loans without repayment of old loans" across the board, regardless of the circumstances. In addition, there are individual bank units in agricultural lending who, using "fear of inability to repay" as a "reason," only lend to wealthy farmers and not to struggling farmers; this phenomenon is even more unacceptable. The main reason for these errors is that some cadres handling agricultural lending do not understand the purpose and significance of their work. They do not truly understand that the country's financial work is to serve production and serve the people. They lend for the sake of lending, for the sake of obtaining interest, or for the sake of recovering the loans in the future. They think that as long as they can lend out the money and recover it, they have "completed the task." This is mainly the result of capitalist management thinking. This kind of thinking must be eliminated in state banks.

    Northern provinces should cherish the spring rain and promptly harrow, roll, and hoe the land to conserve moisture
    Recently, there has been widespread spring rain in the vast areas north and south of the Yellow River, especially in the major cotton and wheat producing areas. Fully utilizing this spring rain is of great importance for this year's wheat harvest and the completion of spring sowing.
    At present, water conservancy facilities are not widespread in northern China, and most of the cultivated land still relies on moisture conservation measures in farming to prevent drought. As the saying goes, "Spring rain is as precious as oil." Northern regions prone to spring drought should especially cherish the rainwater and harrow or hoe the land immediately after each spring rain to prevent moisture evaporation.
    Due to the winter drought, wheat growth has been poor. This spring rain will promote the accelerated greening and rejuvenation of wheat. Applying topdressing fertilizer and hoeing wheat now can fully exert its effectiveness. In order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest, all regions should seize this opportunity to universally mobilize the masses to hoe wheat, conserve moisture, and increase topdressing fertilizer. This spring rain is also very beneficial for spring sowing. However, the amount of moisture evaporation in the northern regions every year in April, May, and June is far greater than the amount of rainfall, so the threat of drought to agricultural production has not been eliminated. After this rainfall, agricultural leading organs in various regions must strictly prevent the growth of complacency and slack thinking among cadres and farmers, and continue to strengthen drought prevention and drought resistance work.

    各地人民银行农村金融业务
    应密切配合防旱抗旱春耕生产
    全国各地正在紧张地进行防旱抗旱春耕生产工作。各地人民银行必须紧密配合这一工作，积极支援农业生产战线，争取今年农业增产任务的顺利完成。
    在开展农村金融业务中，有些银行笼统地强调
    “旧贷不还，新贷不放”。毫无疑问，国家贷款，必须偿还。无故拖欠国家贷款，是对国家人民有害的，是违法的。不过，不能及时偿还贷款的事情，很多是发生在去年受灾地区的受灾较严重的农户；对于这些农户的困难，银行在贷款中应当加以必要的照顾。不分情况，笼统地实行“旧贷不还，新贷不放”，是不对的。另外，还有个别银行单位在农贷工作中，以“怕无力偿还”为“理由”，把款只贷给富裕的农户，不贷给困难的农户；这种现象，更是不能容许的。产生这些错误的原因，主要是某些办理农贷工作的干部，不了解自己进行这项业务的目的和意义，他们没有真正了解国家的金融工作是为生产服务、为人民服务的。他们是为贷款而贷款，为取得利息而贷款，或者是为了将来收回贷款而贷款。他们以为只要把款贷出去而又能收回来，就算“完成了任务”。这主要是资本主义经营思想在作怪。在国家银行里，必须把这种思想加以清除。
    北方各省应珍视春雨，及时耙地耱地锄地保墒
    最近黄河南北广大地区，特别是棉花小麦的主要产区，普遍下了春雨。充分地利用这场春雨，对于今年小麦丰收和完成春耕播种，是有极重大的作用的。
    目前我国北方地区，水利设施还不普遍，绝大部分耕地，还是依靠在耕作上实行保墒措施来防止干旱。农谚说：“春雨贵如油”。易受春旱的北方各地，应该特别珍视雨水，在每次春雨以后，都应随即耙地或锄地，以防止水分的蒸发。
    由于去冬干旱，小麦生长较差。这次春雨，将促使小麦加速返青复壮，现在施用追肥和进行锄麦，可以充分发挥其功效。为了争取小麦丰收，各地应抓紧这一时机，普遍发动群众锄麦保墒，增施追肥。这次春雨对春耕播种也有很大好处。但是，北方各地每年四、五、六三个月的水分蒸发量，远大于降雨量，因此，干旱对于农业生产的威胁并未因而解除。各地农业领导机关，在这次降雨后，必须在干部中间和农民中间严防滋生麻痹松懈思想，继续加强防旱抗旱工作。
