The Moscow Satire Theater recently staged the classic Chinese literary masterpiece "Romance of the Western Chamber," which has been extremely popular with audiences. The play was adapted into a verse drama by Globa, directed by Petrov and Pluchek, with music in the style of Chinese folk songs composed by Kurchmaryov, set design by Yutkevich, and starring Vasilyeva, Dubov, and Arosheva in the roles of Cui Yingying, Zhang Gong, and Hongniang, respectively. The play gives a good account of the anti-feudal theme of the original work. The play fully expresses the courage and enthusiasm of Cui Yingying and Zhang Gong, the innocence and liveliness of Hongniang, and the baseness and shamelessness of the Prime Minister's wife and the abbot. At the beginning of the play, the scene of Facong reaching out from under the dignified abbot's arm for money vividly tells the audience the baseness of the feudal rulers. Later, the audience sees the Prime Minister's wife and the abbot colluding many times, until they conspire to kill Zhang Gong, which fully exposes the ugly and ferocious faces of the feudal ruling class. When introducing the scene of Zhang Gong and Cui Yingying's secret meeting, the stage only shows Hongniang sending Zhang Gong the poem of Cui Yingying's appointment, and Zhang Gong happily moving a bamboo ladder across the stage after reading the poem. This shows the conciseness of the artistic technique and overcomes the shortcomings of some old Chinese troupes deliberately sensationalizing erotic parts. The original story has a scene of "Zhang Gong's Dream at the Grass Bridge Inn," in which Zhang Gong has to go to the capital for the imperial examination on the order of the Prime Minister's wife. On the way, he stays in a rural inn and dreams of Yingying leaving home to run to him. The adapter fully grasped and developed the positive spirit of the original work. When Zhang Gong wakes up from his dream, Cui Yingying really arrives, and they hold hands and step onto the layers of steps together, advancing side by side in the direction of light. This ending is very meaningful. The whole play is full of poetry and a positive and upward spirit. The performance of "Romance of the Western Chamber" is undoubtedly a good contribution to Sino-Soviet cultural exchange.

    莫斯科演出我国古典名剧“西厢记”
    莫斯科讽刺剧院最近演出我国古典文学名著“西厢记”，极受观众欢迎。该剧由葛洛巴改译成诗剧，由彼特罗夫和普鲁契克担任导演，作曲家柯尔奇玛辽夫配以中国民歌风格的音乐，尤特凯维奇作美术设计，由华西列耶娃、都包夫、阿萝谢娃三人分饰崔莺莺、张珙和红娘。该剧对原著反封建主题的积极性有很好的发挥。剧中充分表现了崔莺莺和张珙的勇敢热情、红娘的天真活泼、相国夫人和方丈的卑劣无耻。戏一开头，法聪从道貌岸然的方丈的腋下伸手要钱的场面，就形象地告诉观众封建统治者的卑劣，以后又有很多次让观众看到相国夫人和方丈狼狈为奸的情形，直到同谋杀害张珙，更充分暴露了封建统治阶级丑恶凶残的嘴脸。在介绍张珙和崔莺莺幽会的情节时，舞台上只表现，红娘把崔莺莺约会的诗笺送给张珙，张珙读诗后很高兴地搬了一张竹梯子就过场了。这一方面表现出艺术手法的简练，同时也克服了我国某些旧剧团故意煊染色情部分的缺点。原著的故事有“张珙草桥店惊梦”一场，即张珙不得不奉相国夫人之命赴京赶考，途中住在一个乡村的野店中，梦见莺莺离家奔他而去。改编者充分地掌握并发挥了原著的积极精神。当张珙梦醒时，崔莺莺真的赶到，他们就拉着手一同踏上层层的台阶，并肩向着光明的方向前进，这样的结束是意味深长的。全剧充满了诗意和积极向上的精神。“西厢记”的演出，对中苏文化交流无疑是很好的贡献之一。
