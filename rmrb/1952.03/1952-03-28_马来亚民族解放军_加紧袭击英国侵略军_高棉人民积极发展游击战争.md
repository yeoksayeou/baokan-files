Xinhua News Agency, March 27th—British imperialism, which has been waging a nearly four-year, hopeless, bloody colonial war in Malaya, is increasingly frantically abusing and suppressing the Malayan people,妄想 attempting to force them to submit.

According to the London "Worker's Daily" on the 14th, in the Berlim area of Perak, all residents living in a cluster of thatched huts, including the elderly, women, and children, were forced by the British colonial authorities to walk for seven days through the Malayan jungle to be "relocated" to Jeli in Kelantan. Before these villagers were driven out, the British army burned their huts and grain. They were not allowed to take anything out, only some personal belongings. There were a total of 217 villagers, including 80-year-olds and infants carried on their mothers' backs. Even more cruelly, one woman was forced to give birth on the road, and the infant died after birth.

Another dispatch from Telepress London on the 20th stated that the British imperialist police had completely burned down all the houses in a village in the port of Selangor. All 250 residents of the village were forced to leave, 59 of whom were deported, and the rest were sent to concentration camps.

However, no matter how cruelly the British colonialists carry out suppression, the Malayan people's national liberation struggle is becoming increasingly resolute. A British Information Services dispatch from London on the 18th admitted that the number of attacks by the Malayan National Liberation Army in February had increased compared to January, with "major incidents" reaching 202. On March 20th, in the Raub area, not far from where former British High Commissioner for the Federation of Malaya, Gurney, was killed last October, another team of British military police was ambushed by the Malayan National Liberation Army, resulting in three British soldiers killed and ten wounded. According to a communiqué issued by the British colonial authorities, this battle was the fiercest in nearly four years.

Xinhua News Agency, March 27th—According to a Vietnam News Agency dispatch from North Vietnam on the 20th: The people throughout Cambodia are enthusiastically responding to the Cambodian People's Liberation Committee's campaign launched at the beginning of this year to intensify guerrilla warfare and increase production. People from all walks of life have held many meetings to discuss plans for carrying out this movement. Preah Maha District in eastern Cambodia recently held a meeting attended by more than 80 representatives from the army, government, and people's organizations. The meeting summarized the work of 1951 and many valuable experiences in developing guerrilla warfare and increasing production. Based on the program of the Cambodian People's Liberation Committee, the meeting formulated the work plan for the district for this year. The meeting also decided to further strengthen the friendship between the Cambodian and Vietnamese people.

    【新华社二十七日讯】在马来亚进行了将近四年毫无希望的血腥的殖民战争的英帝国主义，正在越来越疯狂地虐待和镇压马来亚人民，妄想迫使马来亚人民屈服。
    据伦敦“工人日报”十四日报道，在霹雳州伯里姆地方，住在一片茅屋里的全体居民，包括老人、妇女和儿童，都被英国殖民当局强迫步行七天，穿过马来亚的丛林，“迁移”到吉连丹州的日莱去。在这些村民还没有被赶出以前，英国军队就把他们的茅屋和五谷都烧毁了。什么东西都不准拿出来，只许他们带了一些随身之物。村民共有二百十七人，其中包括有八十岁的老人和母亲身上背着的婴儿，更残酷的是，有一个妇女被迫在路上分娩，婴儿生出后就死掉了。
    另据电通社伦敦二十日的消息说，英帝国主义者的军警已将雪兰峨州港口一个村庄的所有房屋完全烧毁。全村二百五十个居民都被强迫离开，其中五十九人被驱逐出境，其余的被送进集中营。
    可是无论英国殖民者怎样残酷地进行镇压，马来亚人民的民族解放斗争越来越坚决了。英国新闻处伦敦十八日电供认，马来亚民族解放军在二月份的出击次数比一月份又有增加，“大事件”已达二百零二次。三月二十日，就在离开去年十月间前英国驻马来亚联合邦高级专员格尔奈被击毙的地方不远的劳勿地区，又有一队英国军警受到马来亚民族解放军的伏击，英军死三名，伤十名。据英国殖民当局发表的公报说，这一次战斗是将近四年以来最激烈的一次。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十日消息：高棉全国各地人民正热烈地响应高棉人民解放委员会在今年年初发动的加紧游击战争和提高生产的运动。各界人民举行了许多会议，讨论进行这个运动的计划。高棉东部的普莱马豪县最近也举行了一次会议，参加的有军队、政府和人民团体的代表八十多人。会议总结了一九五一年的工作，以及发展游击战争和增加生产的许多宝贵经验。会议根据高棉人民解放委员会的纲领，拟订了该区本年的工作计划。会议并决定进一步加强高棉和越南人民的友谊。
