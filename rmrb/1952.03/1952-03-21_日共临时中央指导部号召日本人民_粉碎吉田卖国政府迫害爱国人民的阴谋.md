    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: Belated news from Tokyo: The reactionary Yoshida government has been systematically spreading rumors that "the Japanese Communist Party will stage riots and arson across the country on February 10th," attempting to use this as a pretext to frantically suppress the active defenders of peace and democracy in Japan - the Japanese Communist Party and all patriotic people in Japan. The Provisional Central Steering Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a solemn statement on February 7th, thoroughly exposing this despicable conspiracy of the reactionaries.
    The statement said: The Yoshida government's conspiracy to spread rumors this time is not only to suppress the Japanese Communist Party, but also to suppress all honest people who are fighting against rearmament and war, against laws of an evil nature, low wages, heavy taxes, compulsory grain requisitioning, and land seizure; to suppress patriotic people, trade unions, and democratic groups who are fighting for the abolition of the occupation system.
    The statement pointed out: The Yoshida government had been plotting this conspiracy before. It fabricated a series of "incidents" such as the "military espionage incident". The Yoshida government is attempting to use this suppression to enable the Diet to pass the "Regulations on Organizations Act", thereby establishing a fascist ruling force in one fell swoop.
    The statement further said: This kind of conspiracy will be repeated in the future, because this conspiracy stems from the class nature of the Yoshida government, and is also carried out in accordance with the orders of its superiors - the instigators of international war. They are not only frantically suppressing our party, but also suppressing all peace activists, all patriots, and all those who defend freedom and justice. They believe that as long as there is no popular resistance, they will be able to easily carry out rearmament and launch a war.
    The statement continued: The Yoshida government is no longer a government representing the Japanese people. The Yoshida government itself is openly destroying all justice and truth, destroying the constitution, laws, Diet, social order, and using Japanese state property and state organs to carry out traitorous political conspiracies. This is a betrayal of the Japanese people.
    The statement emphasized: Our party resolutely protests against this anti-national political conspiracy of the Yoshida government. We demand the immediate dissolution of the Diet in order to overthrow the traitorous government as soon as possible and establish a government that truly represents the people.
    The statement finally called on the Japanese people to rise up, expose the conspiracy of the Yoshida traitorous government, take immediate action, crush the suppression measures, overthrow the Yoshida government, and work together to establish a national liberation democratic government.

    日共临时中央指导部号召日本人民
    粉碎吉田卖国政府迫害爱国人民的阴谋
    【新华社二十日讯】东京迟到消息：吉田反动政府曾有组织地散布“日本共产党将于二月十日在全国暴动、放火”的谣言，企图借此疯狂镇压日本的和平民主的积极保卫者——日本共产党和日本一切爱国人民。日共临时中央指导部在二月七日发表了严正的声明，彻底地揭露了反动派的这一卑鄙阴谋。
    声明说：吉田政府这次散布谣言的阴谋，不仅在于镇压日共，并且也将镇压一切为反对重新武装和战争，为反对性质恶劣的法案、低工资、重税、强制征粮、征收土地而斗争的正直的人们；镇压为取消占领制度而斗争的爱国人士、工会和民主团体等。
    声明指出：吉田政府在此以前就在策划这个阴谋了。它制造了“军事间谍事件”等一系列的“事件”。吉田政府企图利用这种镇压，使国会得以通过“团体等规正法”，一举而确立法西斯统治势力。
    声明进一步说：这种阴谋今后还会重演，因为这种阴谋出于吉田政府的阶级本质，同时也是遵照它的上司——国际战争发动者的命令而执行的。它们不仅是疯狂地镇压我党，并且镇压一切和平运动者、一切爱国者、一切保卫自由和正义的人们。它们认为只要没有人民的反抗，就能够毫不费力地进行重整军备，发动战争。
    声明继续说：吉田政府现在已经不是代表日本国民的政府了。吉田政府本身就在公开破坏一切正义和真理，破坏宪法、法律、国会、社会秩序，并使用日本的国家财产和国家机关来进行卖国的政治阴谋。这就是对日本国民的背叛。
    声明强调说：我党坚决抗议吉田政府的这种反国民的政治阴谋。我们要求立即解散国会，以便早日打倒卖国政府，建立真正代表国民的政府。
    声明最后号召日本人民起来揭露吉田卖国政府的阴谋，马上采取行动，粉碎镇压措施，打倒吉田政府，并同心协力地建立民族解放民主政府。
