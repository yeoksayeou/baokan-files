The Chongqing Municipal authorities, after uncovering illegal organizations such as the "Star Four Reunion," which saw the bourgeoisie attacking the state, further discovered the heinous fact that the bourgeoisie dispatched their internal saboteurs directly into the workers' class organization – the trade union – to usurp the leadership of the trade union.

These treacherous merchants knew that, in addition to directly attacking state-owned enterprises, sending their internal saboteurs into the trade unions to usurp leadership and engage in illegal activities in the name of the union would eliminate "obstacles" and allow them to do whatever they pleased.

In Chongqing, the private Yongxing, Datong, and Xieda shipping companies, in order to facilitate defrauding the government for loans and collectively engaging in the crime of stealing state property, prepared to organize a "joint venture." But the treacherous merchants were extremely cunning. Fearing that their crimes would be exposed by the workers, they planned an internal operation in advance, first attacking the trade union and arranging for their "mole" to enter, eliminating concerns "internally." Li Bosen, the capitalist of Yongxing Company, had his confidant Chen Shoushan enter the trade union as an employee and even become the leader of a union group. After Chen Shoushan infiltrated the trade union, he collected information about the workers and reported it to Li Bosen every day as a reference for his "decision-making." On the other hand, he bought off backward workers and isolated and attacked upright employees. For example, when accountant Tong Zhonghua saw through their trickery and expressed dissatisfaction, Chen Shoushan collected Tong Zhonghua's "historical materials" in the name of the trade union, "accused" him to the Public Security Bureau, and framed him. After carrying out these conspiracies, Li Bosen used Chen Shoushan to spread arguments such as "collective operation is the government's policy" among the employees, preparing the ground for the "joint venture." However, they felt that it was still unreliable. Soon, they held a secret meeting at Li Bosen's home and decided to establish a "core organization" within the trade union, with Chen Shoushan as the "group leader," deciding to meet at a certain place every noon and enlist other employees to participate in the "peripheral organization." This meeting also established several "programs": support "joint venture," get close to the capitalists; the core organization must be kept absolutely secret, no betrayal, no selling out; establish peripheral organizations, strive for "the masses," etc.

After this arrangement and deployment, the leadership of the trade union was completely usurped by the internal saboteurs "sent in" and "pulled over" by the bourgeoisie, and the treacherous merchants' "joint venture" plan was finally realized. After the "joint venture" (the Yaxi Company was established), the "core group" internally determined the list of members of the trade union committee and held a "core" and "peripheral" meeting to pass the internally determined list of members and elect Chen Shoushan as the director of the trade union. They agreed to transfer the false accounts made by Datong and Xieda companies to Yaxi Company and violated labor laws by shielding seven people privately hired by the capitalists during the "joint venture" in the name of the trade union. The trade union also guaranteed loans from the state bank for the capitalists, totaling about 2 billion yuan, for the capitalists to engage in speculation and profiteering. When the trade union became a tool for the capitalists, it began to attack the workers. In September of last year, the capitalists decided to lay off a group of employees, but they did not dare to openly violate the law; so, after conspiring with their internal saboteurs, they gathered more than 20 employees who were prepared to be laid off, on the pretext of "improving political awareness," and promised "no layoffs, no salary cuts"; but under the guise of "study," they took more clever and vicious measures and successively laid off five of the employees. The treacherous merchants of Yaxi Company completely occupied the trade union, turning the workers' class organization into a tool for their illegal activities.

The capitalists of Chongqing Juxingcheng Bank also usurped the leadership of the trade union.

Dong Qingbo was originally the general manager of Chongqing Juxingcheng Bank, but was later ousted due to internal infighting. Not reconciled, he instructed his son Dong Zhenjie (a major shareholder of Juxingcheng Bank) to seize the leadership of the trade union to carry out personal conspiracies. In the past, Juxingcheng Bank had a feudal "Friendship Association" small group that could control everything in the bank. After liberation, Dong Zhenjie knew that the "Friendship Association" was illegal, and only the trade union was the legitimate organization of the working class; so, when the establishment of the trade union was being planned, he manipulated the election through members of the original "Friendship Association" and became the director of the trade union. On the one hand, he used ultra-"left" slogans and the demands for employee welfare to deceive the masses and win their trust; on the other hand, he pretended to be active to win the trust of the higher-level trade union. After deceiving both the upper and lower levels, he used the trade union as a tool to propose overthrowing this and supporting that among the workers. In this way, the capitalists in power let him be a "standing director," and he immediately proposed that his father be a "supervisor." After his goal was achieved, he colluded with the bank's manager Yang Shoubai to sell out the interests of the employees. He deliberately raised the issue of employee welfare with excessive demands; so, the capitalists used this as an excuse to clamor to the People's Bank and the United Front Department, so that the workers' welfare issues were not resolved. Later, Dong Zhenjie further infiltrated the preparatory committee of the Chongqing Municipal Finance and Trade Union and seized the position of standing committee member. The trade union was also controlled by him – the agent of the capitalists.

In the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of national economic intelligence, the treacherous merchants were unwilling to hand over the leadership they had already usurped, unwilling to destroy the results they had painstakingly stolen, and they still tried to struggle. For example, Zhang Xinxian, the internal saboteur sent by the treacherous merchant Hong Zelin of Chongqing Qunda Department Store, stole the exposé materials of the store's trade union during the movement. After obtaining the information, these treacherous merchants went to make false confessions.

Isn't this ironclad proof of the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on the working class and its organizations? No matter how vicious and rampant they are, no matter how cunning they are, if they do not confess their crimes, repent, and bow their heads in admission of guilt, they will eventually be crushed by the people.

Wuhan Municipal illegal businessmen in the construction industry, over the past three years, have not only stolen a large amount of state assets, but have also directly usurped the leadership of the construction industry union

In August 1950, when workers in factories and enterprises in Wuhan were setting up trade unions, the small bosses and treacherous merchants of the Liu Gui Ji and Pan Fu Xing construction plants, Liu Shaohai and Pan Yuqing, began to conspire to form a "puppet union". On the one hand, they hid their identities and pretended to be employees of other factories to deceive the upper-level union, while on the other hand, they sent Meng Guobin, the secretary of the construction industry guild, to actively liaise with illegal businessmen or capitalist representatives from several large factories in the construction industry, such as Gui Xingbang, a shareholder of the Southwest Construction Plant, and Bao Zhongxian, the capitalist representative of the Liuhe Construction Company, to establish this "puppet union". They privately appointed Gui Xingbang as chairman and Meng Guobin as vice chairman. Bao Zhongxian, Liu Shaohai and others served as committee members. At that time, because the Wuhan Municipal Construction Industry Union (the upper-level union of the construction industry union) was controlled by feudal contractors, this illegal union was quickly approved. In May 1951, due to the extreme dissatisfaction of the masses of construction industry workers with this puppet union, Gui Xingbang, in order to ease public anger, held a "re-election" under his manipulation, expelling Liu Shaohai and Pan Yuqing, who had already revealed their true colors, from membership, but Gui Xingbang, Bao Zhongxian and others still occupied the leadership position.

Since its establishment, the construction industry "puppet union" has been used by the treacherous merchants as a tool to steal state assets and rule the workers. First, they used the puppet union to steal state property. When the treacherous merchants applied to the People's Government for business licenses, they used the "union" to vouch for them, falsely reporting funds and deceiving the government. For example, the Yongnian Construction Plant only had more than 30 million yuan of capital, but it falsely reported to the government as 200 million yuan, and the "puppet union" stamped it as proof, so it was rated as a first-class construction plant; the Xinmeixin Construction Plant, in addition to a room and a few tables and chairs, had no capital at all, but it was also rated as a second-class construction plant with "union" certification. After the treacherous merchants obtained first-class or second-class business licenses, they contracted a large number of projects, stealing materials and cutting corners at will, and stealing state property. The treacherous merchants also restricted employees from participating in union and political activities through the "puppet union". This "union" even decided that: "Participation in the union must have a capitalist certificate."

More than 20 employees of the Yongji Construction Plant requested to join the union, but the capitalist He Zhichao refused to issue certificates, so they could not join. And many managers, small bosses, and escaped landlords were admitted to the union without hindrance because they had "capitalist certificates". The workers expressed deep dissatisfaction with this situation, and accused "the construction industry union is a capitalist union". "Union" committee member Meng Guobin immediately threatened the workers and said: "Whoever says this is a special agent." The treacherous merchants also used this "union" to illegally exploit the interests of the workers. In May 1951, the employees proposed to sign a collective labor-capital contract with the capitalists, but the "union" did not notify the capitalists until December 25, and a nominal contract was signed in January of this year. The regulations stipulated were not implemented. For example, Article 12 of the contract stipulated: "The year-end bonus is to be given at the discretion of the management, taking into account the hard work of the labor, according to the profit and loss situation." Kuang Zheng, the manager of the Yongnian Construction Plant, only gave the year-end bonus to the employees and not to the workers, which not only directly harmed the interests of the workers, but also provoked the relationship between employees. The "puppet union" did not organize any cultural education or welfare facilities for the workers.

After the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of national economic intelligence was launched, the economizing and inspection committee of the construction industry union did not have a sufficient understanding of the true face of the construction industry union, and still wanted to rely on the members of this "puppet union" to carry out the "Five-Anti" struggle, so that the movement was seriously obstructed. After the economizing and inspection committee staff deeply mobilized the masses, and the workers angrily exposed the crimes of the treacherous merchants, the true face of this puppet union was fully exposed. The Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions immediately dismissed most of the members of the construction industry union and expelled them from membership, and at the same time cleared out more than 20 treacherous merchants and class alien elements who had infiltrated the union. At present, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has sent an inspection team to further rectify the construction industry union organization in conjunction with the "Five-Anti" movement to consolidate the leadership of the working class.

    资产阶级派遣内奸打入工会的恶毒阴谋
    ——重庆武汉违法资本家把持工会组织的几个事例
    重庆市在破获资产阶级向国家进攻的“星四聚餐会”等非法组织之后，又发现资产阶级派遣他们的内奸直接打入工人阶级的组织——工会内部，篡夺工会领导权的罪恶事实。
    这些奸商们知道，除了他们直接向国营企业进攻外，把他们的内奸派进工会内部，篡夺工会领导权，以工会的名义进行违法活动，更可免除“障碍”，更可为所欲为。
    重庆私营永兴、大同、协大三家航运公司，为了便于向政府骗取贷款，准备组织“合营”，集体进行盗窃国家财产的勾当。但奸商们是极其狡诈的，他们怕自己的罪恶被工人揭发，便事先策划一番内应工作，首先向工会进攻，把他们的“坐探”安排进去，解除“内部”的顾虑。永兴公司资方李伯森让他的亲信陈寿山以职员的身分打入工会，而且当了工会的小组长。陈寿山混入工会以后，一方面搜集工人的情况，每天向李伯森汇报，作他“决定问题”的参考；一方面收买落后工人，孤立与打击正派的职工。譬如会计童仲华看出他们的诡计，表示不满，陈寿山便以工会的名义收集童仲华的“历史材料”，向公安局“控告”，加以陷害。李伯森进行了这些阴谋活动之后，便利用陈寿山，在职工中散播“集体经营是政府的政策”等论调，为“合营”作好准备。但是他们认为还不可靠，不久又在李伯森的家里召开秘密会议，决定在工会内部成立“核心组织”，以陈寿山为“组长”，决定每天中午在某处开会，并拉拢其他职工参加“外围组织”。这个会议还确定了几条“纲领”：拥护“合营”，靠近资方；核心组织绝对保密，不背叛，不出卖；建立外围组织，争取“群众”等。
    经过这番安排和布置，工会的领导权完全被资产阶级“派进来”“拉过去”的内奸所篡夺，奸商们的“合营”计划终于如愿以偿了。“合营”（成立了亚西公司）以后，“核心小组”便内定工会委员会的委员名单，还举行了“核心”和“外围”大会，通过内定的委员名单，并选陈寿山为工会的主任委员。他们同意把大同、协大两公司所造的假账转入亚西公司，并且违反劳动法令，以工会名义包庇“合营”时资方私自添雇的七个人。工会还为资方作担保向国家银行先后贷款约二十亿元，给资方投机倒把。当工会成为资方的御用工具后，便开始向工人开刀。去年九月资方决定解雇一批职工，但又不敢明目张胆地违反法令；于是和他们的内奸策划后，把准备解雇的二十多个职工，藉口“提高政治觉悟”，集中起来“学习”，并且保证“不裁员、不减薪”；但却在“学习”的名义下，采取更巧妙更恶毒的办法，先后解雇了其中五个职工。亚西公司的奸商完全占领了工会，把工人阶级的组织变成他们进行非法活动的工具。
    重庆聚兴诚银行资方也篡夺了工会的领导权。
    董庆伯原是重庆聚兴诚银行的总经理，后来由于他们内部的排挤下了台。他不甘心，便指使他的儿子董贞杰（聚兴诚银行大股东）窃取工会领导权来进行个人的阴谋活动。聚兴诚银行过去有一个封建性的“联谊会”的小集团，可以左右该行的一切。解放后，董贞杰知道“联谊会”是不合法的，只有工会是工人阶级的合法组织；于是在酝酿成立工会时，他便通过原来“联谊会”的分子操纵选举，当了工会的主任委员。他一方面以过“左”的口号、职工的福利要求来骗取群众的信任；一方面则伪装积极，骗取上级工会的信任。当他把上下都蒙骗了以后，就以工会作为工具，在工人中提出打倒这个、拥护那个。这样，当权的资方便让他作“常董”，他即提出让他父亲作“监委”。他的目的达到之后，他便和该行经理杨受百勾结，出卖职工利益。他故意以过高的要求提出职工的福利问题；于是资方便以此为藉口，向人民银行和统战部去叫嚣，使工人的福利问题反而得不到解决。后来，董贞杰又进一步打入重庆市财政金融工会筹备委员会，窃据了常务委员的职权。工会也就被他——资方的代理人所操纵了。
    奸商们在反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报斗争中，不甘心把已经篡夺的领导权交出来，不甘心把他们费尽心机盗窃到的成果一旦摧毁，他们还企图挣扎。如重庆市群大百货公司奸商洪泽霖派进工会的内奸张信贤，在运动中盗窃店员工会的检举材料。这些奸商得到情报后，便去假坦白。
    这不正是资产阶级直接向工人阶级及其组织猖狂进攻的铁证吗？不管他们怎样恶毒猖狂，不管他们怎样诡计多端，假如再不坦白悔过、低头认罪，终于要被人民粉碎的。（重庆新华日报）
    武汉市营造业的违法商人，三年来不仅大量地盗窃国家资财，而且直接篡夺了营造业工会的领导
    权。
    一九五零年八月，当武汉市各工厂、企业的职工纷纷建立工会时，刘桂记和潘复兴两家营造厂的小老板、奸商刘少海和潘禹卿也就开始阴谋组织“御用工会”。他们一面隐瞒自己的身份，冒充别厂的职员来蒙蔽上级工会，另一方面又派遣营造业同业公会秘书孟国宾四出活动，串连了营造业几家大厂的违法商人或资方代理人，如西南营造厂的股东桂兴邦、六合建筑公司资方代理人包仲贤等把这个
    “御用工会”成立起来。他们私自推定桂兴邦任主席、孟国宾任副主席。包仲贤、刘少海等做委员。当时因为武汉市建筑业工会（营造业工会的上级工会）为封建把头所把持，因此，这一非法工会也就很快地被批准。一九五一年五月，由于营造业工人群众对这个御用工会极度不满，桂兴邦为了缓和民愤，在他的操纵下举行了一次“改选”，把已经暴露了真面目的刘少海、潘禹卿二人开除会籍，但桂兴邦、包仲贤等依然窃据领导地位。
    营造业“御用工会”自成立以后，奸商们一直把它作为盗窃国家资财和统治工人的工具。首先，他们利用御用工会来盗窃国家财产。奸商们在向人民政府领取营业执照时，就利用“工会”来为其作证，虚报资金，欺骗政府。例如永年营造厂的资本只有三千多万元，可是他向政府虚报为二亿元，由
    “御用工会”盖章证明，因而被评为甲等营造厂；新美新营造厂除一间房子几张桌椅外，根本没有什么资本，经“工会”证明也被评为乙等，奸商们拿到了甲等或乙等营业执照后，就大量地承包工程，从中肆意偷工减料，盗窃国家财产。奸商们又通过“御用工会”限制职工参加工会和政治活动。这个“工会”竟然决定：“参加工会必须有资方证明。”
    永济营造厂有二十多个职工要求参加工会，资本家何志超不肯证明，他们就无法入会。而不少经理、小老板、逃亡地主却因为有“资方证明”，毫无阻碍地被吸收入会。如魏复兴营造厂老板魏秋屏、建昌营造厂经理赵德国等都做了工会会员。工人们对这种情形深表不满，纷纷指责“营造业工会是资本家的工会”。“工会”委员孟国宾马上威胁工人说：
    “那个说这话就是特务。”奸商们又利用这个“工会”非法剥削工人的利益。一九五一年五月，职工们提出要和资方订立劳资集体合同，可是“工会”直拖到十二月二十五日才通知资方，到今年一月才订了一个空头合同，所订的条例均未实现，例如合同第十二条规定：“年终奖金为照顾劳方辛劳，按盈亏情况酌情发给。”永年营造厂经理匡政却只将年终奖金发给职员，不发给工人，不仅直接损害了工人利益，并且挑拨了职工之间的关系。“御用工会”对工人们的文化教育、福利设施等更是丝毫没有举办。
    反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动展开后，建筑业工会节约检查委员会对营造业工会的真实面目认识不足，还想依靠这个“御用工会”的委员来开展“五反”斗争，以致运动受到了严重的阻碍。经过节约检查委员会工作人员深入发动群众，工人们愤怒地揭发了奸商们的罪行以后，这个御用工会的真实面目才全部暴露。武汉市总工会立即将该营造业工会的大部分委员撤了职，开除了他们的会籍，同时清除了二十多个混入工会的奸商和阶级异己分子。目前市总工会已派了检查组，结合“五反”运动发动工人群众，进一步整顿营造业工会组织，以巩固工人阶级的领导权。（新华社）
