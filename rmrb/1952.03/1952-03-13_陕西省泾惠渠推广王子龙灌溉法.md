Shaanxi Province's famous Jinghui Canal irrigation area expanded its irrigated area by more than 112,000 mu last summer after the implementation of the Wang Zili irrigation method. The Jinghui Canal originally could only irrigate 700,690 mu, but after the improvement of the irrigation method, it can irrigate 818,000 mu.

The previous irrigation system of the Jinghui Canal was very unreasonable. The water usage method was to determine the water usage time of each branch canal according to the size of the irrigated area of each branch canal. Each branch canal then allocated a certain amount of water usage time to each farmer according to the amount of land they owned. However, the sowing area size of crops, the amount of water needed by crops, and the timing of water usage in each branch canal irrigation area were extremely inconsistent, resulting in some crops that urgently needed water not being able to obtain sufficient water due to time constraints, while some fields that did not urgently need water had to be watered at the same time within the limited time. The Jinghe River's water volume also often changed. In addition, the water flow speed decreased in the downstream of the canal, and there was seepage and evaporation along the way. Therefore, even in the same amount of water usage time, the amount of water used by each farmer often varied greatly, and some farmland that urgently needed water could not get sufficient water.

In 1949, Wang Zili, the head of the third section of the fourth branch canal of the Jinghui Canal, created a new and reasonable water usage method. This method allocated water according to the sowing area of crops, the amount of water needed by crops, and the timing of water usage, breaking the previous mechanical regulations for using water according to time. For example, in the summer, cotton plants need the most water when they are flowering and bolling, while the water usage for other autumn seedlings can be delayed slightly. At this time, the canal water can be concentrated to irrigate cotton fields first. If the water volume is insufficient and cannot irrigate all cotton fields, the percentage of water usage is prescribed in order: those with 10 mu or less are watered completely at once, and those with more than 10 mu are watered 80% first. If there is water left over, it will be replenished. This new method of water usage allows each farmer to water according to the prescribed percentage of water usage, and is no longer restricted by time. From then on, each farmer eliminated the worry of water shortage and the phenomenon of grabbing and monopolizing water. This new method of water usage also shortened the time interval between each rotation, greatly improving the efficiency of irrigation. In the summer of 1949, the fourth branch canal of the Jinghui Canal tested this irrigation method. Not only did the 41,000 mu of cotton fields upstream and downstream generally receive sufficient water, but the rotation period was gradually shortened by three days. In 1951, despite encountering the adverse situation of continuous water stoppage for 701 hours, the irrigation efficiency was increased by 40%, the rotation period was shortened by six days, and each cubic meter of water per second could irrigate 1,100 mu of land (originally it could only irrigate more than 700 mu).

In order to promote Wang Zili's irrigation method, the areas along the Jinghui Canal are now actively training water management personnel and rectifying grassroots irrigation organizations. This year, the fourth branch canal also plans to test advanced water usage methods such as furrow irrigation, shallow irrigation, and frequent irrigation to maximize the efficiency of canal water and continue to expand the irrigated area.

### 陕西省泾惠渠推广王子龙灌溉法

    陕西省泾惠渠推广王子龙灌溉法
    陕西省著名的泾惠渠灌溉区，去年夏季推行了王子龙灌溉法后，使泾惠渠的灌溉面积扩大了十一万二千多亩。泾惠渠原来只能浇地七十万零六千九百多亩，改进灌溉法后能浇地八十一万八千多亩。
    泾惠渠以往的灌溉制度很不合理，用水方法是按照各斗渠灌溉面积的大小，算定各斗渠的用水时间。各斗渠再按照各农户地亩的多少划分给各农户一定的用水时间。但是各斗渠灌溉区域内的农作物播种面积大小和农作物需水量的多寡、用水时间的先后极不一致，致使一些亟需用水的作物因时间限制不能得到充足的水量，而一部分需水不迫切的田地，在限定时间内也得同时放水。泾河水量也常起变化，加之渠水下游流速减低，沿途渗漏蒸发，所以就是在同样长的用水时间内，各农户用水量也往往相差很大，有一些需水很急的农田就得不到充分的水量。
    一九四九年泾惠渠第四支渠第三段长王子龙创造了一种新的合理用水方法。这个方法是按照农作物的播种面积和农作物需水量的多寡和用水时间先后分配用水，打破了以往按时用水的机械规定。如夏季棉株开花结铃需水最多，其他秋苗的用水可以稍缓一步，这时，渠水就可集中先灌棉田。如水量不足，不能灌全部棉田时，就按次序规定用水的成数：十亩以下的一次浇完，十亩以上的先浇八成，如果水有剩余再行补浇。这种新的使水方法，使各农户用水量能按规定成数浇水，再不受时间的限制，从此各农户消除了缺水的忧虑和抢水、霸水的现象。这个新的使水方法还使每次轮浇的时间距离缩短，大大提高了灌溉的效能。一九四九年夏季，泾惠渠的第四支渠试行这个灌溉法的结果，不但使上、下游四万一千亩棉田普遍得到充足水量，而且逐渐将轮浇的期限缩短了三天。一九五一年虽然遇到断续停水七百零一小时的恶劣情况，灌溉效能却提高了百分之四十，轮浇期限缩短了六天，每秒立方公尺的水量能浇地一千一百亩（原来只能浇七百多亩）。
    为了推广王子龙的灌溉法，泾惠渠沿渠地区，现在正在积极地训练行水人员和整顿基层灌溉组织。第四支渠今年还准备试行畦灌、浅灌、勤灌等先进的用水方法，发挥渠水的最高效率，继续扩大灌溉面积。（新华社）
