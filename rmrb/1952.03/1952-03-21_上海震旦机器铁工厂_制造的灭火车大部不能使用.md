    Shanghai Zhendan Machinery Iron Factory
    Manufactured Fire Engines Mostly Unusable

    To the Editor: Last June, our company entrusted the East China District Company to order seven "207" dual-purpose light fire engines from Shanghai Zhendan Machinery Iron Factory, at a price of 189 million yuan. The contract signed by both parties stipulated that the factory should deliver goods according to the specified specifications and guarantee excellent and solid materials; if there is any shoddy workmanship or substandard quality, it should be responsible for compensating for the losses. The seven fire engines were shipped to Xi'an successively last winter. After we tested them one by one, we found that most of the fire engines could not be started. One of them burned out the coil in the Manidu flywheel during the initial start-up. It turned out that this fire engine was refitted with old machines and could not be used at all. The illegal behavior of Zhendan Machinery Iron Factory, using inferior goods to replace good ones and fake goods to pass off as genuine ones, has caused great losses to the people's property. If a fire were to occur, the consequences would be unimaginable. We request the Shanghai Municipal Committee for Frugality Inspection to handle this issue.

    上海震旦机器铁工厂
    制造的灭火车大部不能使用
    编辑同志：去年六月间，我公司委托华东区公司向上海震旦机器铁工厂定购“二○七”两用轻便救火车七部，价格一亿八千九百万元。双方所订合约规定：厂方应依规定规格交货，并担保质料精良坚固；如偷工减料，不合规定，应负责赔偿损失。七部救火车在去年冬先后运抵西安。经我们逐一试验后，发现大部分救火车不能发动，其中有一部在初次发动时，就把马尼度甩盘内的线圈烧坏。原来这部救火车是用旧机器改装的，根本无法使用。震旦机器铁工厂以坏顶好，以假充真的犯法行为使人民财产遭受很大损失。要是一旦发生火警，它的后果更不堪设想。我们要求上海市节约检查委员会处理这一问题。
