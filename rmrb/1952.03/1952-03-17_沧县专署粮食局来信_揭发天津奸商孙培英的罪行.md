Cangxian Prefectural Grain Bureau Letter

Exposes the Crimes of Tianjin Merchant Sun Peiying

Tianjin's Zhongcheng Construction Factory's unscrupulous merchant Sun Peiying bribed cadres, cut corners on materials and workmanship, and twice formed a "defense alliance" during the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement.

The unscrupulous merchant Sun Peiying is the deputy manager of Zhongcheng Construction Factory, and Liu Xirui (the manager's elder brother) is the person in charge of the factory's construction site. In May 1951, the factory contracted to build six warehouses for our bureau. During construction, Sun Peiying and others used despicable means such as sending money, gifts, inviting to dinner, and inviting to the theater to bribe and corrupt our bureau's cadres in order to cut corners on materials and workmanship. Jia Weiqing, the inspector of our bureau, was one of those bribed and corrupted by Sun Peiying and others. Now, Jia Weiqing has initially admitted to accepting more than 25 million yuan in bribes. When the anti-corruption movement began, the unscrupulous merchant had twice formed a "defense alliance" with Jia. The first time was on the 19th day of the twelfth lunar month last year, when Sun personally came to Cangxian and secretly said to Jia: "The money and things I gave you, I won't say, and you don't say either. That's my own money, it has nothing to do with the factory's finances. We'll still have to get along in the future, so let's communicate more." The second time was on the second day of the first lunar month this year, when Sun sent his fourth younger brother to Jia's house to say: "The problem has been reported. Sun Peiying said 25 million yuan, but didn't mention the things. You should also say this number! (Jia said that it was 25 million yuan including the things)." The crimes of the unscrupulous merchant Sun Peiying and others are numerous. We request that relevant departments quickly conduct a thorough investigation.　Hebei Province Cangxian Prefectural Grain Bureau

    沧县专署粮食局来信
    揭发天津奸商孙培英的罪行
    天津市中盛营造厂奸商孙培英贿赂干部，偷工减料，并在反贪污、反盗窃运动中两次订立“攻守同盟”。
    奸商孙培英是中盛营造厂的副经理，刘锡瑞（正经理的哥哥）是该厂工地的负责人。一九五一年五月，该厂承建我局六幢仓房。在施工时，孙培英等用送钱、送礼、请吃饭、请看戏等卑鄙手段，贿赂、腐蚀我局干部，借以偷工减料。我局监工员贾尉卿就是被孙培英等贿赂、腐蚀的一个。现在，贾尉卿已初步承认曾经受贿二百五十多万元。反贪污运动开始时，奸商曾经两次和贾订立“攻守同盟”。第一次是去年夏历十二月十九日，孙亲自来沧县，秘密地对贾说：“我给你的钱和东西，我不说，你也别说。那是我自己的钱，没柜上的关系。今后咱们还要往一块凑合呢，多通信。”第二次是今年夏历正月初二日，孙派他四弟到贾家说：“问题已被检举，孙培英说了二百五十万元，没有说东西，你也说这个数吧！（贾说的是连东西在内才二百五十万元）”奸商孙培英等罪恶多端，我们要求有关部门迅速彻查。　河北省沧县专署粮食局
