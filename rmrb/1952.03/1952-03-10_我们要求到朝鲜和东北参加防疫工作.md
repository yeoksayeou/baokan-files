    We Request to Participate in Epidemic Prevention Work in Korea and Northeast China
    Editor: The American imperialists dare to continue waging bacteriological warfare in Korea and our Northeast China, attempting to salvage their already doomed defeat on the Korean front. We can no longer tolerate this!
    We have organized ourselves. We request the organization to allow us to go to Korea and Northeast China to participate in epidemic prevention work. We will dedicate our greatest strength to the motherland.
    The entire staff of the Environmental Sanitation Section of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Health and Engineering Bureau
    (Total of thirty-two people, signatures omitted)
    We, all the fifth-year (Class 75) medical students of Peking University Medical College participating in the anti-corruption struggle, were filled with immense anger upon seeing the news reports that American imperialists were spreading insect bacteria in Korea and our great motherland's Northeast!
    We have an unwavering determination to defend the motherland. We have already studied bacteriology, parasitology, infectious diseases, and clinical laboratory techniques, and we have done a lot of mass work. Now is the time. Please allow us, the relevant leading departments, to go to the front lines to participate in epidemic prevention work. We are eagerly waiting!
        Fifth-year students of the Department of Medicine, Peking University Medical College (Total of twenty-eight people, signatures omitted)

    我们要求到朝鲜和东北参加防疫工作
    编辑同志：美帝国主义敢于继续在朝鲜及我们祖国的东北进行细菌战，妄图挽救它在朝鲜前线已经注定了的失败，我们再不能容忍了！
    我们已经组织起来。我们要求组织上让我们到朝鲜和东北参加防疫工作。我们将把最大的力量献给祖国。
    北京市人民政府卫生工程局环境卫生科全体干部

    我们北大医学院医学系五年级（七十五班）全体在校参加反贪污斗争的同学看到报载美帝国主义在朝鲜和我们伟大祖国的东北撒布昆虫细菌的消息后，心头激起无比的愤怒！
    我们有着坚定不移的保卫祖国的决心。我们已经学过了细菌、寄生物、传染病、临床化验等科，我们曾经做过许多群众工作。现在是时候了，请有关领导方面允许我们到前线去参加防疫工作，我们迫切地等待着！
        北京大学医学院医学系五年级学生（共二十八人，签名略）
