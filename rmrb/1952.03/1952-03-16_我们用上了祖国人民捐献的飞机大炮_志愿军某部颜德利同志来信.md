    We are using the planes and artillery donated by the people of the motherland
    ——Letter from Comrade Yan Deli of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    To the Editors: We are now using the planes and artillery donated by the people of the motherland. Not long ago, we cooperated with neighboring units in two small naval battles, and achieved great victories, liberating Ai Island, Dahe Island and Xiaohe Island, and annihilating more than 500 enemies. Among them were five British and American officers. The captured weapons and ammunition filled five or six large and small warehouses, and there was so much grain that it could not be counted for the time being. Our powerful air force has already exerted great power on the Korean front. We often see our planes fighting enemy planes in the sky. Our planes are as agile as eagles, shooting down enemy planes one by one like sparrows. Enemy planes sometimes really look like cowardly dogs, and as soon as they encounter our planes, they immediately tuck their tails and run away. Now our food is also particularly good. 70% of what we eat is refined grains (rice and white flour), as well as various canned meats and many vegetables. We have also received the letters of condolence and RMB sent by the young students. We especially like the letters from the children. We read the letters again and again, write the names of the children who sent the letters in our notebooks, and then carefully put them in our backpacks; and paste the RMB they sent on the notebooks as precious souvenirs.
    The planes and artillery supported by the people of the motherland, the various exquisite foods, the good-looking books and magazines, and the various enthusiastic letters of condolence have further strengthened our determination to kill the enemy and our confidence in defeating American imperialism. We will fight more bravely in the future and forever defend the peace of the motherland.

    我们用上了祖国人民捐献的飞机大炮
    ——志愿军某部颜德利同志来信
    编辑同志：祖国人民捐献来的飞机和大炮，我们现在已经用上了。不久以前，我们配合友邻部队渡海进行了两次小的战斗，就获得了很大的胜利，解放了艾岛、大和岛与小和岛，歼灭了敌人五百多名。其中有英、美军官五名。缴获的武器和弹药有大小五、六仓库，粮食更多得一时无法查清。我们强大的空军，已经在朝鲜前线发挥了很大的威力。我们经常看到我们的飞机在天空和敌机搏战。我们的飞机像雄鹰一样地矫健，把敌机像麻雀一样地一只只击落下来。敌机有时真像胆小的狗，一遇到我们的飞机，马上就夹着尾巴回头跑了。现在我们的伙食也特别好。我们吃的百分之七十都是细粮（大米和白面），还有各种肉类罐头和许多蔬菜。小同学们寄来的慰问信和人民币，我们也都收到了。我们特别喜欢小朋友们的来信。我们把信读了又读，把寄信来的小朋友的名字写在我们的笔记本上，然后小心地打在背包里；并把他们寄来的人民币粘在笔记本上，作为珍贵的纪念品。
    祖国人民支援的飞机大炮，送来的各种精美食品，好看的书籍杂志和各种热情的慰问信，更加强了我们杀敌的决心和战胜美帝国主义的信心，我们今后要更英勇地战斗，永远保卫祖国的和平。
