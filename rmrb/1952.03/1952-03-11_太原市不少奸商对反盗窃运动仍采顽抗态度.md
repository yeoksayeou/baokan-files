    Many Unscrupulous Merchants in Taiyuan Still Show Stubborn Resistance to the Anti-Theft Movement
    Editor: Unscrupulous merchants in Taiyuan are adopting a stubborn attitude towards the anti-theft movement and continue to attack the working class. Zhai Yuwen, the boss of Zhonghe Chemical Factory, acted like a rogue after workers exposed his crimes. When workers demanded that production resume, he said he had no capital. When workers asked for wages, he said, "I only have a pair of worn-out leather shoes, you can go sell them!" Li Ruixiang, the second manager of the factory, offered a mattress in lieu of barber fees, pretended to be poor, and borrowed quilts from workers, asking them to pity him. The boss of Yuanqingyong used the excuse of having no money to avoid opening for business and secretly deposited the funds in Beijing. Some unscrupulous merchants, in order to suppress the workers' struggle, are reducing workers' living standards. The boss of Qinglong Iron Factory reduced workers' living standards and told workers to ask the trade union for help. Ma Ziying, the boss of Xin Da Restaurant, does not give the workers enough to eat. We warn these unscrupulous merchants that no matter what tricks you use, we will carry the movement through to the end, and we will not stop until we have won a complete victory.

    太原市不少奸商对反盗窃运动仍采顽抗态度
    编辑同志：太原市奸商对反盗窃运动采取顽抗态度，继续向工人阶级进攻。中和化学厂老板翟郁文，在工人揭发他的罪行后大耍无赖。工人要求开工，他说没本钱；工人要工资，他说：“我只有一双破皮鞋，你们去卖吧！”该厂二经理李瑞祥拿褥子来顶理发钱，假装穷相借工人被子，叫工人可怜他。元庆永老板藉口无钱不开张，暗地里把款子存在北京。有的奸商为了压制工人斗争，降低工人生活。庆隆铁工厂老板降低工人生活，叫工人找工会想办法。新大饭店老板马子英不给工人吃饱。我们正告这些奸商，任你用尽诡计，我们一定要把运动进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。　　　张玉枢
