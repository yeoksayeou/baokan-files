Order of the State Council of the Central People's Government
Zheng Zheng Zi No. 22

The "Several Provisions on Handling Corruption, Waste, and Overcoming Bureaucratic Errors" issued by the Central Austerity Inspection Committee and the "Standards and Measures for Categorizing and Handling Industrial and Commercial Households in the 'Five-Anti' Movement" issued by the Beijing Municipal People's Government have been discussed and approved by the 127th Session of the State Council on March 8. They are hereby promulgated and should be implemented on a trial basis in all regions. During the trial implementation, combine them with the specific conditions of the local area. If any supplements or modifications are deemed necessary, they should be reported to the State Council for review and approval.

These two documents have set out different punishments according to the seriousness of the circumstances and the attitude of honest self-criticism for all acts that violate national economic policies and financial systems, violate government decrees, and serious errors committed by state personnel in their work. At the same time, the two documents fully embody the policy of combining strictness with leniency and combining transformation with punishment. This is in line with the current reality and is correct. After the issuance of these two documents, the exposure and reporting of all embezzlers and thieves who have not yet confessed or whose confessions are not yet thorough should be carried out thoroughly. There should be no relaxation because most of the problems have entered the processing stage, so as not to affect the thorough completion of the task of combating corruption, combating theft, and combating bureaucracy.

The great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have educated state personnel and the people of the whole country, and will eliminate the toxins of the old society and establish a clean and simple atmosphere in the new society throughout the country, unite the people of the whole country more closely, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

After the end of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the national construction work will rapidly enter a new stage. After this, if anyone commits such illegal and undisciplined acts that undermine national economic policies and financial systems, they will be regarded as endangering the cause of national construction and will be severely punished without leniency.

This order.

Premier Zhou Enlai

    中央人民政府政务院命令
    政政字第二十二号
    中央节约检查委员会关于处理贪污、浪费及克服官僚主义错误的若干规定和北京市人民政府在“五反”运动中关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法两个文件，业经本院三月八日第一百二十七次政务会议讨论批准，兹特公布，望各地遵照试行。在试行中，应结合当地具体情况，如有认为须要补充、修改之处，应报告本院审核批准。
    这两个文件，对于一切违反国家经济政策和财政制度、违反政府法令的行为及国家工作人员在工作中所犯的严重错误，都已按其情节轻重、坦白检讨的态度，分别定出不同的处分；同时，两个文件又充分地体现了严肃与宽大相结合、改造与惩治相结合的方针。这是符合于当前的实际的，是正确的。这两个文件发布以后，对于所有尚未坦白或坦白尚未彻底的贪污、盗窃分子仍应彻底揭发、检举，不得因大多数的问题已转入处理阶段而稍有放松，以致影响反贪污、反盗窃斗争任务的彻底完成。
    伟大的“三反”和“五反”运动，教育了国家工作人员，教育了全国人民，并将在全国范围内，肃清旧社会的污毒，树立新社会廉洁朴素的风气，使全国人民更加团结，使人民民主专政更加巩固。
    在“三反”和“五反”运动结束以后，国家建设工作即将迅速地转入新阶段。过此以后，不论任何人，如再有此类违法乱纪、破坏国家经济政策和财政制度的行为，均将视为危害国家建设事业，定予从严惩处，绝不宽贷。
    此令
    总理  周恩来
    一九五二年三月十一日
