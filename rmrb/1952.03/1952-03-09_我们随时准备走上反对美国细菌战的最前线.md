    We are ready to go to the forefront of the fight against the American bacteriological warfare
    To the Editor: We, the faculty, staff and students of the Peking University School of Medicine, are determined to take practical actions to combat the atrocity of the American invading air force spreading bacteria in our country. As early as when the news of the American invaders spreading bacteria in Korea reached our school, it aroused the anger of all the people in the school. Zhang Minghe, a student in the second year of the Department of Medicine, bitterly accused the Japanese fascists of spreading plague germs in his hometown—Wenzhou, Zhejiang, and killing a large number of people. Everyone expressed infinite hatred for the American imperialists who colluded with Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals to conduct bacteriological warfare. More than 300 people in the school signed up to go to Korea to work on eliminating bacteria. Professor Fang Liang of the Department of Bacteriology and some lecturers and teaching assistants have already joined the volunteer team for epidemic prevention and inspection to assist Korea and went to work on the front lines in Korea. Today, when everyone read in the newspaper that the American invaders dared to invade our country to spread bacteria, many people's anger was even more uncontrollable. Students in some classes immediately held forums. Most of the teachers and students in the college wrote letters of determination to Chairman Mao, the Central Ministry of Health, and the school leaders, requesting to go to Korea and the Northeast to eliminate the bacteria spread by the American invaders. Doctors, nurses, and assistants from various departments of Peking University Hospital have requested to join the epidemic prevention team. The staff of the Peking University Pharmaceutical Factory have prepared a large number of insecticides, ready to be transported to the front lines at any time. The workers in the machine room said that if needed, they could manufacture epidemic prevention equipment at any time. Everyone is preparing: ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and resolutely smash the bacteriological warfare of the American invaders!

    我们随时准备走上反对美国细菌战的最前线
    编辑同志：我们北京大学医学院的师生员工，决心以实际行动来打击美国侵朝空军侵入我国撒布细菌的暴行。早在美国侵略者在朝鲜撒布细菌的消息传到我校时，就引起了全校人员的愤怒。医学系二年级学生张鸣禾，悲愤地控诉了以前日本法西斯在他的家乡——浙江温州一带撒布鼠疫菌，杀害大批人民的罪行。大家对于勾结日本细菌战犯来进行细菌战的美帝国主义，表示了无限的仇恨。全校有三百多人签名要求到朝鲜去作扑灭细菌的工作。细菌学科的方亮教授和一部分讲师助教，已经参加了志愿援朝防疫检验队，前往朝鲜前线工作。今天，当大家从报上读到美国侵略者胆敢侵入我国境内来撒布细菌的消息时，许多人的愤怒更无法遏止。有的班的同学们立刻举行了座谈会。全院大部分教员学生都写了决心书给毛主席、中央卫生部和学校领导方面，要求赴朝鲜和东北去扑灭美国侵略者撒布的细菌。北大医院各科的大夫、护士和助理员等，都要求参加防疫队。北大药厂的职工们，已经准备了大批杀虫剂，准备随时运往前线。机器房的工友们表示，如果需要，他们随时可以制造防疫仪器。大家都在准备着：随时响应祖国的号召，坚决粉碎美国侵略者的细菌战！
