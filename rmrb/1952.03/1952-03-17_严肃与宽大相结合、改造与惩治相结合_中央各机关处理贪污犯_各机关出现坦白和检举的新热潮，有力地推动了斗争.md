Xinhua News Agency, 16th: In the past half month, central government organs, in accordance with the regulations of the Central Committee for Economy and Inspection, have dealt leniently with a large number of embezzlers who sincerely repented, and strictly dealt with a number of embezzlers who had solid evidence but stubbornly refused to confess. As a result, a new upsurge of confessions and accusations has emerged, powerfully promoting the progress of the movement. These regulations of the Central Committee for Economy and Inspection have been approved and promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government on the 11th of this month.

The experience of various central organs proves that this handling method of combining severity and leniency, and combining reform and punishment, has given the anti-corruption struggle a powerful weapon. In the past half month, many organs have held conferences for handling cases and further mobilization. Those who received lenient treatment were moved to tears, expressed their determination to repent, atone for their crimes, and immediately threw themselves into the anti-corruption battle. Some people previously had doubts about the lenient policy of the People's Government, believing that the public trial held on February 1 only dealt with a few people as a show; now they truly realize the firm will of the People's Government to thoroughly eliminate the poisonous legacy of the old society and save those who have gone astray as much as possible. They said, "The People's Government truly does what it says." Many embezzlers who had not completely confessed their crimes voluntarily confessed their problems or supplemented materials, and some even accused others. As a result, another batch of embezzlers were caught, and some clues to embezzlers were discovered. At the same time, the broad masses of people have increased their anger and hatred towards those embezzlers who have solid evidence but refuse to confess their crimes and embark on the bright road.

The handling conferences held by various organs are actually conferences to further promote the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle towards complete victory. At the conference of the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government, various combat teams used their rest time to persuade embezzlers who had not yet confessed, and those who had just had their embezzler hats removed also actively participated in the battle. Good news came frequently, many embezzlers supplemented their materials, and one stubborn major embezzler also confessed his crimes.

At the further mobilization conference held by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, the leadership announced that a batch of embezzlers who had confessed thoroughly would be given lenient treatment, and announced that two embezzlers with solid evidence who refused to confess would be arrested on the spot. The embezzlers who received lenient treatment included four major embezzlers with serious circumstances, but who confessed thoroughly and actively exposed others. For example, Deputy Engineer Gao Shibin, who embezzled 300 million yuan personally, caused the state to lose 1.8 billion yuan, and was the mastermind of a collective embezzlement case, but because he confessed thoroughly, the leadership of the Ministry of Trade announced that it would be responsible for suggesting that the judicial authorities give him a lighter sentence and grant him a suspended sentence. After the meeting, Gao Shibin voluntarily requested to participate in the anti-corruption struggle and worked very actively. At this meeting and after the meeting, many people in the ministry confessed their embezzlement facts and accused others. Liu Shide, an embezzler from the Engineering Department, voluntarily admitted embezzling more than 270 million yuan after the meeting, and another major embezzler also voluntarily confessed to major embezzlement crimes. At the same time, several new clues to major embezzlers were discovered.

From the existing experience of the central organs in handling embezzlers in large numbers, the following points must be paid attention to when conducting such handling in the future: First, the leadership must fully explain the spirit of combining severity and leniency to the backbone and all cadres and the masses in the movement, and mobilize them to thoroughly discuss Premier Zhou's order of March 11, the People's Daily editorial, and the documents approved and promulgated by the State Council, in order to unify everyone's understanding. Second, the specific handling of each embezzlement problem must be reviewed by the masses and approved by the leadership; finally, all those who have committed embezzlement errors and received lenient treatment, regardless of the size of their errors, must deeply reflect on themselves to the masses and admit their mistakes with their heads down. Only in this way can the masses, especially those who have committed embezzlement errors, be given a profound education, and only in this way can this handling truly become a driving force for thoroughly eradicating corruption.

### 严肃与宽大相结合、改造与惩治相结合  中央各机关处理贪污犯  各机关出现坦白和检举的新热潮，有力地推动了斗争

    严肃与宽大相结合、改造与惩治相结合
    中央各机关处理贪污犯
    各机关出现坦白和检举的新热潮，有力地推动了斗争
    【新华社十六日讯】中央各机关半个月来根据中央节约检查委员会的规定，对大批真诚悔过的贪污分子作了宽大处理，并对一批证据确实而坚不坦白的贪污分子作了严格处理，因而出现了一个坦白和检举的新的热潮，有力地推动了运动的进展。中央节约检查委员会的这些规定，已由中央人民政府政务院在本月十一日批准公布。
    中央各机关的经验证明：这种严肃与宽大相结合、改造与惩治相结合的处理办法，给了反贪污斗争以强有力的武器。半个月来许多机关召开了处理和进一步动员的大会。得到宽大处理的人感动得热泪横流，表示决心悔改，戴罪立功，并立即投入反贪污的战斗。有些人过去对人民政府的宽大政策还有所怀疑，认为二月一日举行的公审大会只处理了少数几个人，是做样子的；现在真正认识到了人民政府彻底肃清旧社会污毒和尽可能挽救失足分子的坚决意志。他们说：“人民政府真是说到那里做到那里。”许多还没有彻底坦白的贪污分子纷纷自动交代问题，或者补充材料，有的并且检举了别人。因此又有一批贪污分子被捉住，又有一些贪污分子的线索被发现。同时，广大群众对那些证据确实而不肯坦白认罪、走上光明大道的贪污分子，更增加了愤怒和仇恨。
    各机关举行的处理大会实际上都是进一步推动反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争走向彻底胜利的大会。在中央人民政府公安部的大会上，各战斗小组利用休息时间向还没有坦白的贪污分子进行劝说，那些刚刚被摘掉贪污分子帽子的人也积极参加了战斗。一时捷报频传，不少贪污分子补充了材料，有一个顽固的大贪污犯也供认了自己的罪行。
    中央人民政府贸易部举行的进一步动员大会上，领导方面宣布对一批坦白彻底的贪污分子予以宽大处理，并宣布对两个证据确实而拒不坦白的贪污分子当场予以逮捕。得到宽大处理的贪污分子中包括四个情节严重，但是坦白彻底、积极检举的大贪污分子。例如副工程师高士彬，个人贪污三亿元，使国家损失十八亿元，并且是一个集体贪污案件的主谋者，但是因为他坦白彻底，贸易部领导方面宣布将负责建议司法当局从轻判处徒刑并予以缓期执行。会后高士彬就自动要求参加反贪污斗争，而且工作得很积极。在这次会上以及会后，该部有许多人坦白了自己的贪污事实，并检举了别人。工程处贪污分子刘士德在会后自动承认贪污二亿七千多万元，另外一个大贪污分子也自动供认了重大的贪污罪行，同时又有几个新的大贪污分子的线索被发现出来。
    从中央各机关大批地处理贪污分子的已有的经验看来，今后各机关进行这种处理时必须注意如下数点：首先，领导方面必须向运动中的骨干和全体干部群众充分说明严肃与宽大相结合的精神，并发动他们深入讨论三月十一日周总理的命令、人民日报的社论以及政务院批准公布的文件，以统一大家的认识。其次，对各个贪污问题的具体处理必须经过群众的评议和领导方面的批准；最后，所有犯过贪污错误而得到宽大处理的人，不论他的错误大小如何，必须向群众深刻反省，低头认错。只有这样，才能给群众，尤其是给那些犯过贪污错误的人以深刻的教育，也只有这样，才能使这种处理真正成为彻底肃清贪污的动力。
