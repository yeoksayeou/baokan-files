    Central Cultural Ministry's Art Affairs Administration's Reply to Comrade Wang Baolin's Opinion
    We believe that Comrade Wang Baolin's criticism of a circus troupe in Houzui Town, Xinpu City, Shandong Province, for forcing young children to perform cruel and painful acts to make money is very correct.
    In order to eliminate the remaining feudal system in acrobatic troupes and circuses and protect the human rights and physical and mental health of child performers, the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government issued the following measures to the cultural (education) departments of major administrative regions, the cultural and educational departments (bureaus) of five provinces and two cities in North China, and the cultural and educational department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on November 29, 1951:
    1. Local cultural and educational departments should immediately investigate the actual situation of circus, magic, and acrobatic troupes in their respective regions to see if there are any acts of mortgaging, selling, or other similar behaviors involving children. Are there any phenomena of coercion or non-voluntariness in the training or performance of children? If such phenomena exist, they should be corrected and dealt with appropriately.
    2. Child performers who voluntarily remain in their original acrobatic troupes should be given certain reasonable treatment. Those who do not wish to stay should be allowed absolute freedom to choose their profession or join other troupes.
    3. The training and performance of child performers must pay attention to their physical and mental health, and corporal punishment or other cruel and unscientific methods must not be used.
    4. The competent authorities in various localities should provide child performers with regular learning opportunities to strengthen their political and cultural education.
    The above regulations have been notified for investigation and handling. Now, based on Comrade Wang Baolin's opinion, we have reported to the Central Ministry of Culture to request that all localities be notified again to promote practical attention, investigation and handling of this issue.

    中央文化部艺术事业管理局对王保林同志意见的答复
    王保林同志对山东新浦市猴嘴镇的一个马戏团迫令幼年儿童作残酷痛苦的表演借以敛钱的批评，我们认为是很正确的。
    为了肃清杂技团马戏团中残留的封建制度，保障儿童艺人的人权及其心身的健康，中央人民政府文化部曾于一九五一年十一月二十九日向各大行政区文化（文教）部，华北五省二市文教厅（局）、内蒙自治区文教部，提出处理办法如下：
    一、各地文教部门应即调查本地区马戏、魔术、杂技团的实际情况，有无将儿童抵押、贩卖及其他类似的行为？对儿童的训练或演出，有无强迫或非自愿的现象？如有这种现象时，应加纠正并作适当处理。
    二、对于儿童艺人，其志愿留在原杂技团服务者应予以一定的合理待遇。不愿留者应允许其有选择职业或参加其他剧团的绝对自由。
    三、对于儿童艺人的训练与表演，必须注意其身体与精神上的健康，不得施以体罚或其他残酷的非科学方法。
    四、各地主管机关对于儿童艺人，应给以定时的学习机会，加强其政治和文化教育。
    以上规定均通知进行调查处理在案。现在我们根据王保林同志的意见，已呈报中央文化部请再通知各地，促起对这一问题予以切实的注意和调查处理。
