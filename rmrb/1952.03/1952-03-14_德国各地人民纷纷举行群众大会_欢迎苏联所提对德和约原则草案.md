Xinhua News Agency, March 13th, Berlin Dispatch: The Soviet government's note to the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, as well as the draft principles for a German peace treaty proposed by the Soviet government, have been widely and warmly welcomed by the German people.

    In the German Democratic Republic, according to the German News Agency, news of the Soviet note spread across the country like wildfire. Radio stations broadcast the Soviet note and the draft principles for a German peace treaty throughout the day. Crowds of people gathered wherever there were loudspeakers, listening intently to news about the Soviet note. On streets, squares, shops, residential areas, and factories, people were discussing the content of the note. Newspapers published special editions, printing the full text of the Soviet note. These newspapers were snatched up as soon as they were released.

    The Central Council of the Free German Youth League issued a letter to all German youth, which stated: The great, peace-loving Soviet Union has opened a bright path for our people towards a happy and peaceful life. The Soviet government has clearly demonstrated its friendly attitude towards the German people and its desire for peace.

    The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Christian Democratic Union passed a resolution warmly welcoming the Soviet government's note and the draft principles for a German peace treaty. The resolution called on Western countries not to reject this generous proposal from the Soviet Union, and should, with the same sense of responsibility for safeguarding world peace, strive to create the necessary conditions for concluding a peace treaty with Germany. Citizens across the republic held mass rallies to express their heartfelt gratitude for the Soviet proposal. A mass rally of 30,000 women and young people was held in Aue. A rally of 70,000 people was held in Chemnitz. Miners at the "Mischers Brown Coal Mine" in Merseburg, after hearing the full text of the Soviet note broadcast, immediately excitedly guaranteed that they would produce an additional one million tons of coal this year.

    The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 14th to specifically discuss the Soviet government's proposal.

    In West Germany, the Soviet note and the draft principles for a German peace treaty also had a wide impact. According to a German News Agency report from Nuremberg: "Since the end of the war, no political event in Nuremberg has aroused such a warm reaction as the Soviet government's note to Western countries and the draft principles for a German peace treaty."

    The people's enthusiastic reaction made it impossible for important spokespersons of the ruling party in West Germany and right-wing Social Democratic leaders to avoid expressing their opinions immediately, acknowledging the importance of the Soviet proposal. Even Jürgen, the chairman of the parliamentary group of the Free Democratic Party, a staunch supporter of Adenauer's policies, admitted that the Soviet note "presents a proposal that seems worth discussing." Mühlenfeld, chairman of the parliamentary group of the German Party, said: "The Western Allies must carefully study the Soviet government's willingness to conclude an agreement." Ollenhauer, deputy chairman of the right-wing Social Democratic parliamentary group, had to state: "This note should be handled seriously and considered carefully."

    Bonn government Chancellor Adenauer immediately met with the High Commissioners of the three Western powers to discuss the Soviet note in detail.

    德国各地人民纷纷举行群众大会
    欢迎苏联所提对德和约原则草案
    【新华社十三日讯】柏林消息：苏联政府就缔结对德和约问题致美、英、法三国的照会以及苏联政府所提出的对德和约原则草案，受到了德国人民广泛而热烈的欢迎。
    在德意志民主共和国，据德意志通讯社报道，关于苏联照会的消息立刻像野火一样传遍了全国。广播电台整天广播着苏联照会及对德和约原则草案。装有广播扩音器的地方，到处都聚集了成群的人们，谛听着关于苏联照会的消息。在各地街头上，广场上，商店中，住宅区和工厂中，人们都在谈论着照会的内容。各报均出特刊，全文登载苏联照会。这些报纸一出来就被抢购一空。
    自由德国青年联盟中央理事会发表了告全体德国青年书，其中说：伟大的、爱好和平的苏联，已为我们的人民打开了走向幸福与和平生活的光明道路。苏联政府确切地证明了它对德国人民的友好态度和对和平的愿望。
    德国基督教民主联盟中央委员会书记处通过决议，热烈地欢迎苏联政府的照会和对德和约原则草案。决议要求西方国家不要拒绝苏联这个慷慨的建议，应该怀着同样的对保卫世界和平的责任感，努力为缔结对德和约创造必要的条件。共和国各地市民纷纷召开群众大会，表示他们衷心感激苏联的建议。欧法特举行了三万妇女和青年参加的群众大会。开姆尼斯举行了七万人参加的大会。梅尔赛堡的“密舍尔褐煤矿场”的矿工们在听到苏联照会全文的广播后，立即兴奋地保证今年要额外增产一百万吨煤。
    德意志民主共和国人民议会定十四日举行会议，专门讨论苏联政府的建议。
    在西德，苏联的照会和对德和约原则草案也产生了广泛的影响。据德意志通讯社纽伦堡消息说：“自从战争结束以来，在纽伦堡还没有过一件政治事件引起过像苏联政府致西方国家的照会及对德和约原则草案所引起的这样热烈的反应。”
    人民的热烈反应使得西德执政党的重要发言人和右翼社会民主党头子也不敢不马上表示意见，承认苏联建议的重要性。甚至阿登纳政策的热心的拥护者、自由民主党议会党团主席尤勒也承认：苏联照会“提出了一个似乎值得讨论的建议”。德意志党议会党团主席米伦费尔德说：“西方盟国必须慎重地研究一下苏联政府愿意缔结协定的心情。”右翼社会民主党议会党团副主席奥伦豪尔也不得不表示：
    “应该郑重地处理并慎重地考虑这个照会。”
    波恩政府总理阿登纳立即与西方三国高级专员开会，就苏联照会进行详细商议。
