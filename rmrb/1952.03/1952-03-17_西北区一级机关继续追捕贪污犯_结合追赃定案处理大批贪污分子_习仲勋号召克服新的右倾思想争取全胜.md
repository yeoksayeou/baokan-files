Xinhua News Agency Report: The third campaign against corruption in Northwest District-level organs, lasting ten days, has now concluded victoriously. The characteristic of this campaign is a three-pronged approach of "tiger" hunting, recovering stolen goods, and adjudicating cases. In the capital construction departments, where "the mountains are deep and the tigers are fat," and in the so-called "clean water departments" of universities, a large number of embezzlers have been exposed. These embezzlers mostly formed various "die-hard alliances" with each other or with the outside world and were exceptionally cunning. However, after the units actively investigated and researched, presenting ironclad evidence, these embezzlers finally fell into the net of the people's law.

The recovery of stolen goods and the adjudication of cases were carried out in combination. During these two tasks, several organs continued to overcome right-leaning ideologies and, based on mobilizing the masses, conducted policy education for embezzlers, calling on them to honestly and fully confess their problems and hand over stolen money and goods, using practical actions of repentance to make up for past misdeeds. Then, they simultaneously mobilized the masses to work among the family members of embezzlers and conducted systematic "checking" and "matching" work. The specific method was to first require embezzlers to confess their social connections such as family, relatives, friends, and merchants, then to confess the motives, purposes, methods, processes, amounts, and uses of the stolen money and goods during the embezzlement, then to confess the "offensive and defensive alliances" inside or outside the organs, and then to hand over the embezzlement evidence—contracts, agreements, IOUs, bonds, and stolen money and goods from investing with private merchants. Then, combined with the materials obtained from the investigation and the performance of the embezzlers in the struggle, analyze and research to distinguish the truth from falsehood. Finally, after mass discussion and leadership approval, the cases were adjudicated. For individual stubborn embezzlers, cases were adjudicated according to the aforementioned procedures based on reliable witnesses and material evidence. In this way, the process of recovering stolen goods and adjudicating cases was a process of verification and also a process of educating the broad masses to raise their class consciousness. Units that conducted the recovery of stolen goods and adjudication of cases according to this method achieved great success.

While carrying out these tasks, the units also seriously dealt with a large number of embezzlers whose embezzlement amount was less than ten million yuan. The Northwest District Level Organs Increased Production and Conservation Inspection Committee convened a conference of more than 60,000 staff members on the 9th. At the meeting, based on the embezzlers' embezzlement circumstances and the principle of lenient treatment for those who confess and severe punishment for those who resist, a group of embezzlers was dealt with and announced at the meeting. This conference, and similar meetings held by various units before or after this, powerfully promoted the continued confession of many embezzlers who had not confessed or had not confessed thoroughly, thus further isolating the major embezzlers and advancing the battle to encircle and suppress major embezzlers. Currently, the number of embezzlers dealt with has reached more than half. Since the 12th, the anti-corruption struggle has entered the fourth campaign. Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, pointed out: The fourth campaign is the most arduous campaign and it is necessary to overcome new right-leaning ideologies. On the basis of overcoming relaxation and impatience, we must sweep away the bourgeoisie's fortress inside the revolution. How many embezzlers there are, that many embezzlers must be exposed. Eradicate evil completely; do not stop fighting until it is thorough. Xi Zhongxun also powerfully criticized the right-leaning ideologies of some leading cadres on the issue of cadres. Xi Zhongxun said: After some units cleared out many embezzlers, their "stall" was rotten; in fact, their "stall" had long been rotten. In the past, due to right-leaning ideologies and bureaucracy, it was not seen. Now that this rotten "stall" has been seen and the inside story of this rotten "stall" has been exposed, that is very good. But this is only one aspect; the more important aspect is that in the battle, we have discovered and cultivated a large number of excellent cadres. Our revolutionary cause will not only not be weakened because these embezzlers have been cleared out; on the contrary, isn't it precisely because the embezzlers have been arrested and a large number of excellent cadres have emerged that our cause will be strengthened? Xi Zhongxun specifically instructed the leading cadres of various units: From now on, they must quickly seek out a large number of outstanding elements from the struggle and promote them to various leading positions to replace those degenerate elements who have already rotted and are beyond salvation. Xi Zhongxun's instruction has now been implemented first in several financial and economic units.

### 西北区一级机关继续追捕贪污犯  结合追赃定案处理大批贪污分子  习仲勋号召克服新的右倾思想争取全胜

    西北区一级机关继续追捕贪污犯
    结合追赃定案处理大批贪污分子
    习仲勋号召克服新的右倾思想争取全胜
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：西北区一级机关反贪污斗争的第三个战役，历时十日，现已胜利结束。这个战役的特点是打“虎”、追赃和定案三管齐下。在“山深虎肥”的基本建设部门和所谓“清水衙门”的大学校，都打出了大批的贪污犯。这批贪污犯大都互相或和外界订有各种“死守同盟”，狡诈异常，但在各单位积极调查研究，摆出了铁证以后，这批贪污分子终于落入了人民的法网。
    追赃和定案工作是结合进行的。在进行这两项工作时，若干机关都在继续克服右倾思想和发动群众的基础上，向贪污分子进行了政策教育，号召他们真实全部交代问题，老实交出赃款赃物，以实际悔过行动来弥补过去部分罪恶。接着就一方面发动群众在贪污分子家属中进行工作，一方面进行系统的“查”“对”工作。具体办法是首先责成贪污分子交代家庭、亲友、商人等社会关系，继交代贪污时的动机、目的、手法、过程、数目和赃款赃物的用途，再交代机关内部或外部的“攻守同盟”，进而交出贪污的证件——和私商入股的合同、契约、借据、债券和赃款、赃物等，然后结合调查所得的材料及贪污分子在斗争中的表现，进行分析研究，辨其真伪，最后经过群众讨论、领导批准再行定案。对于个别顽抗的贪污分子，就根据确实的人证和物证，按照上述手续定案。这样，追赃定案的过程，就是甄别的过程，也是教育广大群众提高阶级觉悟的过程。依照这一方法进行追赃定案的单位，都获得了很大的成效。
    和进行这些工作同时，各单位还严肃地处理了贪污数在一千万元以下的大批贪污分子。西北区一级机关增产节约检查委员会在九日曾召集了六万余名工作人员的大会，会上根据贪污分子的贪污情节及坦白从轻、顽抗从严的处理原则，对一批贪污分子作了处理并在大会宣布。这个大会和在此以前或以后各单位自行召开的类似性质的会议，曾有力地推动了许多没有坦白或坦白不彻底的贪污分子继续坦白，因而也更孤立了大贪污分子，推进了围剿大贪污犯的战斗。现在贪污分子的处理数，已达半数以上。从十二日起，反贪污斗争已进入第四个战役。中共中央西北局书记习仲勋指出：第四个战役是最艰巨的战役，必须克服新的右倾思想。要在克服松劲思想和简单急躁情绪的基础上，把资产阶级安在革命内部的堡垒扫荡净尽，有多少贪污分子，就必须打出多少贪污分子来，除恶务尽，不打彻底，不准收兵。习仲勋又有力地批判了某些领导干部在干部问题上的右倾思想。习仲勋说：有些单位清出很多贪污分子后，它的“摊子”烂了；其实它的“摊子”早就烂了，过去由于右倾思想和官僚主义的原因，没看出来，现在看见这个烂“摊子”了，并且把这个烂“摊子”的内幕拆穿了，这就很好。但这只是一方面，更重要的一方面，是在战斗中，我们已发现和培养了大批的优秀干部。我们的革命事业不但不会因为清除了这批贪污分子而减弱，恰好相反，不正是因为把贪污分子捉走了，大批优秀干部涌现出来了，我们的事业才会有可能地加强起来吗？习仲勋特指示各单位领导干部：从现在起，必须迅速从斗争中把大量的优秀分子物色出来，把他们提拔到各个领导岗位上去，代替那些已经腐烂了的不可救药的蜕化分子。习仲勋的这一指示，现在已首先在若干财经单位中实行。
