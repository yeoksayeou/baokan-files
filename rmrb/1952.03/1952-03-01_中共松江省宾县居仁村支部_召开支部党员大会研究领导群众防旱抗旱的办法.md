    CPC Bin County, Songjiang Province, Juren Village Branch
    Holds Branch General Meeting to Study Methods for Leading the Masses in Drought Prevention and Resistance

    Editor: The CPC Juren Village Branch in Bin County, Songjiang Province, held a branch meeting on February 17th, calling on all party members to conscientiously study the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the "Decision of the Government Administration Council on Vigorously Launching Mass Drought Prevention and Resistance Movements," and to recognize the importance of drought prevention and resistance work. Branch Committee member Liu Fang said, "There was little snow last winter, and there will definitely be a drought this spring, but we Communists have no difficulties that we cannot overcome. We have the confidence to lead the people to overcome the drought and guarantee a good harvest this year." Then, the branch discussed methods for carrying out mass drought resistance: 1. Fully mobilize and educate the masses, overcome the mentality of relying on the heavens for rain, and promote the revolutionary spirit of human power overcoming nature; 2. Advocate early plowing; 3. Implement spring harrowing; 4. The depth of plowing should be deeper than last year; 5. Seize the spring plowing season and start sowing early; 6. Branch committee members should divide their work, supervise and urge each other to achieve the goals. In addition, the meeting repeatedly discussed propaganda methods and decided to implement a system of propaganda members being responsible for specific tasks, and to launch a mass drought resistance and high-yield competition. I think the approach of the Juren Village Branch is worth promoting.

    中共松江省宾县居仁村支部
    召开支部党员大会研究领导群众防旱抗旱的办法
    编辑同志：中共松江省宾县居仁村支部在二月十七日召开了支部大会，号召全体党员认真学习中共中央的指示和“政务院关于大力开展群众性的防旱、抗旱运动的决定”，认识防旱抗旱工作的重要性。支部委员刘芳说：“去年冬天雪下得小，今春一定要旱，但我们共产党是没有克服不了的困难的，我们有信心领导人民战胜旱灾，保证今年的丰收。”接着支部讨论了开展群众性的抗旱的办法：一、充分发动和教育群众，克服靠天等雨思想，发扬人力胜天的革命精神；二、提倡早刨槎子；三、实行春?地；四、翻搓要踩底格子，比去年深耕一寸；五、抓紧春耕季节，早动手播种；六、支部委员分工领导，互相检查，督促实现。此外，会上又反复讨论了宣传办法，决定实行宣传员包干宣传的办法，发动群众性的抗旱丰产竞赛运动。我觉得居仁村支部这种作法值得推广。    李志杰
