    Severely Punish the American Aggressors Who Invaded Our Country and Spread Bacteria
    The heinous and inhumane American aggressors, disregarding the strong protests of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world, have actually expanded the scope of their bacteriological warfare from Korea to our great People's Republic of China. From February 29th to March 5th, the American invading air force in Korea made 68 sorties with 448 aircraft, continuously intruding into Northeast China, spreading bacteria in Fushun, Xinmin, Andong, Kuandian, Linjiang and other places, and indiscriminately bombing the Linjiang and Changdian River mouth areas. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, issued a statement on behalf of the Chinese government on March 8th, lodging a serious protest to the US government, and announcing that all air force personnel who intrude into Chinese airspace and use bacteriological weapons will be treated as war criminals once captured; it was also stated that the US government should bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from invading our country's airspace, using bacteriological weapons, and indiscriminately bombing and strafing, and killing Chinese people. This statement represents the will of the people of the whole country, and the people of the whole country will vigorously strengthen the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to combat the new conspiracy of the American aggressors.
    What does this more barbaric act of the American aggressors illustrate? First of all, it shows that the American aggressors' purpose in attacking Korea is by no means just to enslave Korea, but to use Korea as a base to further invade China and even the whole world. This should arouse people's high vigilance. Secondly, this barbaric action also shows the increasing weakness of the American aggressors. There is a common law among aggressors in history: the closer they get to death, the more insane, brutal, and savage they become, and the more despicable and shameless they become, and the result is always "hastening their own death."
    The American aggressors' indiscriminate bombing of Northeast China and the provocation of spreading bacteria in our country will not bring any benefit to the American aggressors, but will only further isolate them in front of the people of the world and accelerate their defeat. The war criminals who dare to spread bacteria will eventually be sanctioned by justice. The use of bacteriological weapons is the most barbaric act that violates human justice and destroys international conventions. Anyone with a little sense of justice will be angered by this crime and embark on the road of opposing the American aggressors. This situation is already very clear: since the news of the American aggressors spreading bacteria in Korea spread, the International Federation of Trade Unions, representing the vast masses of workers around the world, and people's organizations and people from all walks of life in various countries have expressed extreme anger and solemn protests. This shows that the American aggressors will not escape the fate of "those who commit many injustices will perish."
    We, the Chinese and Korean people, have the power to combat any act of aggression by the American aggressors. The Chinese people have already crushed the eight million troops of the Kuomintang bandit gang fully supported by US imperialism; crushed the vicious conspiracy of the American aggressors' "blockade" and "embargo"; the Chinese and Korean People's forces have annihilated more than 500,000 troops of the American aggressors and their vassal states in their joint operations, and shot down and damaged more than 3,000 of their aircraft. Similarly, we will certainly be able to eliminate the bacteria spread by the American aggressors. The Chinese and Korean People's forces, with high organization, combat effectiveness, and adequate epidemic prevention equipment, will certainly be able to crush the enemy's bacteriological warfare. The health and epidemic prevention personnel of China and Korea who love their motherland and love peace will work together with the military and civilians in various places to eliminate all the bacteria spread by the American aggressors.
    In response to the crimes of the American aggressors continuously invading Northeast China, spreading bacteria, and indiscriminately bombing, the people of the whole country should increase their vigilance a hundredfold, continue to strengthen all aspects of the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, more severely打击 [dǎjī - strike, hit, attack; crack down on] the American aggressors, and crush their conspiracy to prolong and expand the war of aggression.

    严惩侵入我国撒布细菌的美国侵略者
    穷凶极恶、灭绝人性的美国侵略者，不顾中朝人民和全世界人民的强烈抗议，竟把他们进行细菌战的范围从朝鲜扩大到我们伟大的中华人民共和国来了。从二月二十九日到三月五日，美国侵朝空军六十八批，四百四十八架次连续侵入我国东北，在抚顺、新民、安东、宽甸、临江等地撒布细菌，并在临江、长甸河口地区滥施轰炸。我国外交部周恩来部长已于三月八日代表我国政府发表声明，向美国政府提出严重的抗议，并宣布凡属侵入中国领空、使用细菌武器的空军人员，一经俘获，即作为战争罪犯处理；同时声明，所有因侵犯我国领空、使用细菌武器、并滥施轰炸扫射、虐杀中国人民而招致的一切后果，应由美国政府担负完全责任。这个声明代表了全国人民的意志，全国人民将以大力加强抗美援朝工作来打击美国侵略者的新阴谋。
    美国侵略者这一次更野蛮的暴行说明什么呢？它首先说明：美国侵略者进攻朝鲜的目的决不只是为了奴役朝鲜，而且是为了以朝鲜为基地，进一步侵略中国以至全世界。这一点，应该引起人们高度的警惕。其次，这一野蛮行动也表现了美国侵略者的越来越虚弱。历史上的侵略者有一个共同的规律：越是接近死亡，他们就越疯狂、越残暴、越野蛮，越发卑鄙无耻，而其结果总是“自速其死亡”。
    美国侵略者滥炸我国东北和向我国撒布细菌的挑衅，决不会使美国侵略者得到什么便宜，而只能使他们在全世界人民面前更加孤立，并加速他们的失败。敢于撒布细菌的战犯们，最后一定会受到正义的制裁。使用细菌武器是违反人类正义、破坏国际公约的最野蛮的行为，稍微有一点点正义感的人，都会被这种罪行所激怒，走上反对美国侵略者的道路。这种情形，现在就已经看得很明白了：自从美国侵略者在朝鲜撒布细菌的消息传出以后，代表全世界广大工人群众的国际工联和各国的人民团体、各界人民，都表示了极度愤怒和严正抗议。这就说明，美国侵略者将逃不脱“多行不义必自毙”的命运。
    我们中国人民和朝鲜人民，有力量打击美国侵略者的任何侵略行为。中国人民已经粉碎了美帝国主义所全力支持的国民党匪帮的八百多万军队；粉碎了美国侵略者“封锁”和“禁运”的恶毒阴谋；中朝人民部队在并肩作战中，已经歼灭了美国侵略者及其附庸国的五十多万军队，击毁击伤了他们三千多架飞机。同样地，我们也必定能够肃清美国侵略者撒下的细菌。具有高度组织性、战斗性和充足防疫设备的中朝人民部队，一定能够粉碎敌人的细菌战争。中朝两国热爱祖国、热爱和平的卫生防疫人员，将和各地军民同心协力，扑灭美国侵略者所撒布的全部细菌。
    对于美国侵略者连续侵入我国东北撒布细菌和滥施轰炸的罪行，全国人民应该百倍地提高警惕，继续加强抗美援朝的各项工作，更严重地打击美国侵略者，粉碎其延长和扩大侵略战争的阴谋。
