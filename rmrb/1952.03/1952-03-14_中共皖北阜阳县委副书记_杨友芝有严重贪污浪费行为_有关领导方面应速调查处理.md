    Yang Youzhi, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Fuyang County Committee in Northern Anhui, Has Serious Acts of Embezzlement and Waste; Relevant Leaders Should Investigate and Handle This Promptly
    Editor: Yang Youzhi, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Fuyang County Committee in Northern Anhui, has committed serious errors of embezzlement, waste, and bureaucracy. The Fuyang area suffered a severe famine the year before last. Most of the county committee cadres went to the countryside to engage in production and disaster relief work, but Yang Youzhi sat in his office all day listening to the gramophone. When a comrade from the production and disaster relief work team reported to him on the work situation and the biases that had occurred in the distribution of relief grain, and requested instructions on how to resolve them, he continued to listen to the gramophone and did not listen to the comrade's report at all. After the comrade finished speaking and waited for his instructions, he irresponsibly said, "You should still discuss it with the district committee!" Last autumn, the prefectural committee instructed Yang Youzhi to be responsible for establishing a good propaganda network in one district and one township during the land reform movement, but he ignored it.
    Yang Youzhi once embezzled a public bicycle worth two million yuan, as well as items such as a watch and pen. He also used public funds to buy a leather suitcase worth 400,000 yuan and other items from Nanjing. He used public money to show off, putting on airs. He would always host feasts and watch operas when there were meetings, wasting a total of about 50 million yuan.
    Since the launch of the anti-corruption movement, Yang Youzhi has not only failed to take the lead in examining himself, but has also formed cliques, attacked activists, and suppressed democracy. I hope that relevant leaders will promptly investigate and handle this.

    中共皖北阜阳县委副书记
    杨友芝有严重贪污浪费行为
    有关领导方面应速调查处理
    编辑同志：中共皖北阜阳县委副书记杨友芝有严重的贪污、浪费、官僚主义的错误。前年，阜阳地区的灾荒很严重，县委大部分干部都下乡搞生产救灾工作，但杨友芝却整天坐在屋子里听留声机。当生产救灾工作队的一位同志向他汇报工作情况和关于发放救济粮中所发生的偏向，请示解决办法时，他却继续听留声机，根本不听这个同志的报告。等这位同志谈完了，等待他的指示，他却毫不负责地说：“你还是同区委去研究吧！”去年秋天，地委指示杨友芝负责在土地改革运动中建立好一个区和一个乡的宣传网，但他置之不理。
    杨友芝曾经贪污了公家价值二百万元的自行车一辆和手表、钢笔等物，并动用公款从南京买了一只价值四十万元的皮箱及其他物品。他拿公家的钱讲
    “排场”“阔气”，开会必请客、看戏，共计浪费了五千万元左右。
    反贪污运动开展以来，杨友芝不但不带头检查自己，反拉拢小集团，打击积极分子，压制民主，我希望有关领导方面迅速调查处理。
