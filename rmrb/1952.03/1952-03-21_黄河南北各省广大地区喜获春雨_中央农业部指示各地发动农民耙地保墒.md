Xinhua News Agency, March 20th:

    On March 17th and 18th, broad areas of provinces along the Yellow River—Shaanxi, Henan, Pingyuan, Shandong, Hebei, Chahar, and Shanxi—welcomed spring rain. From Chang'an and Jingyang in the west, to Xuzhou and Jinan in the east, from Handan in the north, to south of the Longhai Railway, the rainfall was substantial, and the ground was thoroughly soaked. In the area north of the Dezhou, Shijiazhuang, and Taiyuan line, and south of the Great Wall, the rainfall was one to two inches. In Chahar Province, there was rain and snow. In addition, small rain or snow also fell in most areas of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. If this rain is fully utilized, it will have a vital effect on completing spring sowing and achieving a bumper wheat harvest. To this end, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government specifically sent a telegram on the 20th instructing the above-mentioned rain-affected areas to seize the opportunity and mobilize farmers to harrow land and preserve moisture. The instructions stipulate:

    (1) Wheat-producing areas north of the Yangtze River should universally mobilize the masses to weed the wheat and apply topdressing fertilizer (paying attention to watering with urine). In areas with the habit of harrowing wheat, the masses should be organized to first roll with stone rollers, and then harrow once along the wheat ridges.

    (2) To do a good job in preserving moisture in spring land, land that has been winter-plowed or spring-plowed should be harrowed and raked immediately after the rain to prevent moisture loss. Land that has been harrowed and raked before the rain should be harrowed and raked again after the rain. For soil that is sticky and has sufficient moisture and needs loosening, it should be hoed once (i.e., plowed once with a plow without a moldboard, without turning the soil), and then harrowed and raked immediately after hoeing. In areas with soaking rain, if there is land that has not yet been spring-plowed or has not yet been fertilized with base fertilizer, fertilizer should be applied and the land plowed as soon as possible, and then harrowed and raked immediately after plowing.

    黄河南北各省广大地区喜获春雨
    中央农业部指示各地发动农民耙地保墒
    【新华社二十日讯】三月十七、十八两日，黄河两岸各省——陕西、河南、平原、山东、河北、察哈尔、山西等广大地区喜获春雨。西起长安、泾阳，东到徐州、济南，北到邯郸，南到陇海铁路以南的广大地区内，雨量较大，地已下透。德州、石家庄、太原一线以北，长城以南地区，获雨一指到二指，察哈尔省下的是雨和雪。此外，甘肃、青海、新疆大部地区也曾下小雨或下雪。这场雨如加以充分利用，对完成春播和小麦丰产将有极其重大的作用。为此，中央人民政府农业部，特于二十日发电指示上述获雨地区，抓紧时机，发动农民耙地保墒。指示规定：
    （一）长江以北的小麦产区，应普遍发动群众锄麦、上追肥（注意浇尿）。有耙麦习惯的地区，应即组织群众先用石滚镇压，再顺麦垅耙一次。
    （二）为做好春地保墒，已冬耕或春耕过的地，雨后要赶紧耙耱，以防水分散失。雨前已耙耱过的，雨后应再耙耱。土质粘结水分充足需要松土的，要耠一遍（即用不带犁镜的犁犁一遍，不翻土），耠后随即耙耱。下透雨的地区，如有尚未春耕或尚未施基肥的，要从速施肥耕地，耕后随即耙耱。
