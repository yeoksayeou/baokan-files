    Shattering the Illegal Capitalists' Conspiracy to Muddle Through
    The Beijing Municipal People's Government, in order to give illegal capitalists a chance to reform, has repeatedly and patiently educated them to recognize their illegal acts and mobilized them to confess thoroughly to obtain the people's forgiveness. Recently, it issued the "Investigation and Handling Form for Illegal Industrial and Commercial Households," requiring them to fill it out truthfully so that a definite conclusion could be made about their illegal activities. At the same time, for the sake of prudence, it stipulated that the completed investigation and handling forms of illegal industrial and commercial households must be reviewed and approved by the industrial and commercial household study group, the workers and staff of the factory or store, the district trade union office, and the district thrift inspection committee. However, many illegal capitalists not only did not know how to be grateful and support this benevolent measure of the People's Government, but also adopted an extremely dishonest attitude when filling out the investigation and handling forms. Some even attempted to conceal and overturn the illegal facts they had already confessed to. Generally, the industrial and commercial household study groups, when initially reviewing the investigation and handling forms, carelessly wrote "thorough confession" and considered it done. Many people also mutually protected illegal behavior.
    During the review by workers and staff, because the checkpoints were tightly guarded, the illegal capitalists relapsed into their old ways, shamelessly resorting to various despicable means in an attempt to muddle through. The capitalists universally put away their past ferocious and hideous faces, putting on ingratiating and pitiful appearances, attempting to use sugar-coated bullets to deceive the sympathy of the store workers. Liu Zicun, the capitalist of Yichang Paint Bureau, in order to trick accountant Wang Meicun into stamping the investigation and handling form, knelt before Wang Meicun, crying and begging, saying: "I've already jumped halfway into this 'fiery pit,' if you pull me, I can jump over." Many illegal capitalists rushed to fawn on the store workers, pouring tea and serving rice, trying to soften the workers and staff.
    Other illegal capitalists even tried to evade the review by workers and staff, or impersonated workers and staff to sign and stamp, attempting to deceive the People's Government. These illegal elements deliberately dismissed workers beforehand, or intentionally temporarily sent away more conscious staff members to avoid review. Some simply did not hand over the processing forms to workers and staff, but had the manager and shareholders sign and stamp in the worker column of the form themselves; or they let a few traitors of the working class sign on behalf of other workers. E Wenjun, the manager of Quansheng Native Produce and Food Store, dared to dismiss workers in order to evade review. He had originally confessed to evading taxes of 50 million yuan in turnover, but when filling out the form, he only filled in 20 million yuan, and stated in the worker column "This store has no workers." On the investigation and handling form of Jing'an Home Industry Cooperative, all five people who signed and stamped in the worker column were shareholders. The capitalists of Tongchun Tea House, Huaxin Electrical Appliance Store, and Yusheng Wood Store, etc., even filled in the names of their wives and children in the worker column. Some illegal capitalists also secretly carved the seals of workers and staff, or took the opportunity to secretly stamp with the worker's seal, or went to the worker's home to trick them into handing over the seal to stamp on the document.
    When illegal capitalists used these despicable methods and failed to achieve the goal of muddling through, they used methods such as salary increases, bonuses, and stock participation to lure store workers. For example, in order to pass the review of the store workers, the capitalists of Yufeng Grain Store took out seventeen taels of gold and five hundred silver dollars to give the workers as a share of the company. When the capitalists' attempts to entice the store workers were unsuccessful, they immediately changed their face and adopted threatening tactics. Dong Haiquan, the manager of Risheng Towel Factory, said to the workers: "If you don't sign for me, I will sue you in court." The manager of Fushunxing Copper and Tin Bureau said to the workers: "If you don't stamp, the Federation of Industry and Commerce will come looking for you." Some illegal capitalists, as soon as they passed the review, immediately put on a fierce face and continued to engage in illegal activities. After the Wei Ji Electrical Appliance Store finished its reasoning and struggle meeting, as soon as the shock team left, the capitalist started to scold the store's workers. However, these soft and hard tactics of the illegal capitalists were shattered one by one in the face of the awakened store workers, and aroused even greater resentment among the store workers. In order to smash the capitalist's conspiracy, the workers of Risheng Towel Factory held several reasoning and struggle meetings in succession. The shop assistants of Jishentang Traditional Chinese Medicine Store saw that the manager Zhang Mingyuan and the deputy manager Gao Linqing wrote "a total of 1.7 million yuan in unreported turnover in three years" on the investigation and handling form, and held a reasoning and struggle meeting that night, exposing the two merchants' tax evasion of more than 100 million yuan, as well as illegal activities such as selling fake medicines.
    The vast number of workers and staff members solemnly warned these illegal industrial and commercial households not to play tricks anymore. They also demanded that the government re-examine the criminal behavior of the illegal capitalists, and that the illegal capitalists honestly and thoroughly confess and bow their heads in admitting their guilt.

    粉碎违法资本家矇混“过关”的阴谋
    北京市人民政府为了给违法资本家以改过自新的机会，曾经反复地、耐心地教育他们认清自己的违法行为，并动员他们彻底坦白交代以取得人民的宽恕，最近又发下“违法工商户调查处理表”，要他们据实填写，以便对他们的违法行为作出确切的结论。同时为了慎重起见，并规定违法工商户填好的调查处理表，必须经过工商户学习小组、本厂或本店工人店员、区工会办事处和区节约检查委员会的审查通过。但是，人民政府这种仁至义尽的措施，许多违法资本家不仅不知道感激和拥护，而且在填写调查处理表的时候，还采取了极不老实的态度。有些人甚至企图隐瞒和推翻自己已经供认的违法事实。一般工商户学习小组在初步审查调查处理表时，也都是马马虎虎写上“坦白彻底”的字样，便算完事。有许多人还互相包庇违法的行为。
    在通过工人店员的审查时，由于关口把守得很紧，违法资本家故态复萌，他们无耻地玩弄种种卑鄙手段，企图矇混“过关”。资本家们普遍收藏起过去那一副凶恶、狰狞的面孔，装出殷勤可怜的相貌，企图用糖衣炮弹骗取店员工人的同情。义昌油漆局资本家刘子存，为了骗取会计王梅村在调查处理表上盖章，自己跪在王梅村面前，哭哭啼啼地哀求说：“这条‘火坑’我跳过一半了，你拉我一下，就可以跳过去了。”许多违法资本家赶前赶后地向店员工人献殷勤，替工人店员倒茶盛饭，想软化工人店员。
    另外一些违法资本家竟想逃避工人店员的审查，或者冒充工人店员签字盖章，企图欺骗人民政府。这些违法分子事前有计划地把工人遣散，或者故意临时把觉悟较高的店员支使出外，逃避审查。有的干脆不把处理表交给工人店员，而由经理、股东自己在表内的工人栏签字盖章；或者让工人阶级的少数叛徒冒名盖章。全盛土产食品店经理鄂文君竟敢遣散工人，逃避审查。他原已坦白偷税流水额五千万元，但在填表时，只填了两千万元，并在工人栏内注明“本店无工人”。静安家庭工业社的调查处理表上，在工人栏内签名盖章的五个人全是股东。同春茶庄、华信电料行、玉盛木行等的资方，甚至把妻子、儿女的名字都填在工人栏内。还有一些违法资本家偷刻工人店员的图章，或者乘隙偷盖工人图章，或者到工人店员家里骗来图章盖上。
    违法资本家在使用了这些卑鄙的手段而不能达到矇混“过关”的目的时，便用加薪、提奖、入股等等方法来引诱店员工人。例如裕丰粮栈的资方为了通过店员工人的审查，拿出十七两黄金和五百块银元，要给工人入股。资本家对店员工人利诱不成功时，马上又换了一付面孔，采取恐吓手段。日升毛巾厂经理董海泉对工人说：“你们不给我签字，我到法院告你们。”复顺兴铜锡局的经理对工人说：“你们不给盖章，工商联就找你们。”还有些违法资本家刚刚通过审查，立即又摆出凶恶的面孔，继续干着违法的勾当。魏记电料行开完说理斗争会以后，突击队一走，资方便对本店工人破口大骂。但是，违法资本家这些软的硬的手段，在觉悟了的店员工人面前，一一地被粉碎了，并且激起了店员工人的更大愤恨。日升毛巾厂的工人为了打碎资方的阴谋，连续召开了几次说理斗争会。济善堂国药庄的店员，看见经理张明远、副经理高林卿在调查处理表上写着“三年共漏报流水一百七十万元”，当晚就召开说理斗争会，检举了这两个奸商偷漏税一亿多元，以及卖假药等违法行为。
    广大工人店员们严正地警告这些违法的工商户，要他们不要耍花枪了。并要求政府重新审查违法资本家的犯罪行为，要违法资本家们老老实实地彻底坦白，低头认罪。　　　　　　　　　　　（林洪）
