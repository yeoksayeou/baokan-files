    The United States Continues to Delay and Obstruct Korean Armistice Negotiations
    The Korean armistice negotiations have been ongoing for four months since the second agenda item was agreed upon on November 27th of last year, and discussions on the third, fourth, and fifth agenda items have subsequently commenced. During this period, apart from a principal agreement being reached on the fifth agenda item, the third and fourth agenda items have been delayed in reaching a full agreement due to the US side's insistence on its absurd claims and repeated obstruction.
    Due to our side's repeated efforts, the negotiations on the third and fourth agenda items have reached considerable agreement on many issues. However, there are still two major disagreements, which are the so-called neutral nation nomination issue and the principle of prisoner-of-war release and repatriation, which were created by the US side. The US side's continued use of delaying and quibbling tactics on these two issues is the main reason why the third and fourth agenda items have not yet reached full agreement.
    On the issue of the composition of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in the third agenda item, our side proposed the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia on February 16th as the three neutral countries invited by our side to form the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. However, the US side unreasonably opposed our side's nomination of the Soviet Union as a neutral nation, setting up a new obstacle to delay and obstruct the negotiations. We cannot tolerate the unreasonable attitude of the US side. According to the provisions of Article 38 of the draft agreement proposed by the US side itself, the definition of a so-called neutral country is "a country whose combat troops have not participated in hostile acts in Korea." The three countries proposed by our side have not a single soldier in Korea and fully meet the qualifications of a neutral country as stipulated in this definition. The US side, without any reason, found two so-called "reasons," saying that the Soviet Union "is adjacent to Korea" and that the Soviet Union "has a record of participating in Korean affairs in the past," so the Soviet Union cannot participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. These two so-called reasons are fundamentally contrary to the principle agreement. The US side has no basis to prove that the fact that the Soviet Union is adjacent to Korea is sufficient to remove its status as a neutral country. As for saying that the Soviet Union has a record of participating in Korean affairs in the past, so it is not a neutral country, this is even more incomprehensible. Because the issue is not whether the Soviet Union has a record of participating in Korean affairs, but what kind of record it is! What is the Soviet Union's record of participating in Korean affairs? That is the record of the Soviet Union liberating the Korean people from Japanese fascism; it is the record of the Soviet Union resolutely opposing interference in the Korean War and advocating a peaceful solution to the Korean issue since the United States launched the aggressive war against Korea. The Soviet Union has repeatedly put forward fair proposals in the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council, advocating that the Korean belligerent parties immediately cease fire and regularly withdraw all foreign troops in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and the holding of the Korean armistice negotiations was also promoted by the proposal of the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik. The Soviet Union's efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue have been unanimously supported by the people of all countries, including the people of the United States and Britain. These records of the Soviet Union's participation in Korean affairs not only do not prevent it from becoming a neutral country, but on the contrary, precisely because of this record, the Soviet Union should be invited to participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission more than any other country. This record also proves that the opposition of the United States is unreasonable. In order to quickly reach a full agreement on the third agenda item, our side suggested at the staff meeting of the third agenda item on February 18th that both sides simultaneously and once agree to all the nominations of the other side, or that both sides each nominate three neutral countries without any consent procedures. However, until now, the US side has not accepted our fair and reasonable plan, which can only show that they are deliberately delaying and obstructing the armistice negotiations, and there can be no other explanation.
    In the discussion of the fourth agenda item, our side has always believed that both sides can and should, based on the materials exchanged regarding the prisoners of war of both sides, first determine the principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice. However, the US side has been playing tricks on the issue of prisoners of war, plotting to detain our captured personnel. In order to achieve this sinister purpose, the US side insisted on the absurd claim of so-called "voluntary repatriation" in the negotiations, making the issue of prisoner repatriation the main obstacle in the fourth agenda item. The absurd claim of "voluntary repatriation" insisted upon by the US side is considered by even the reactionary American journalist Lippmann to be "legally untenable (referring to the Geneva Convention)." In order to eliminate this obstacle, our side specifically suggested at the staff meeting of the fourth agenda item on March 21st that after the armistice agreement is signed and takes effect, each side shall release and repatriate the prisoners of war currently held by it. Moreover, our side agreed to the US side's suggestion that the staff meeting of the fourth agenda item enter an administrative meeting from March 25th. Both sides agreed that during the administrative meeting, the content discussed at the meeting would be limited to the official knowledge of both sides and would not be released to the press. However, on the first day of the administrative meeting, the US side violated the agreement and Richway Headquarters revealed the content of the meeting to Reuters reporters, instructing them to conduct one-sided propaganda. However, it can also be seen from the one-sided propaganda of Richway Headquarters that the so-called "new" suggestion of the so-called "compromise solution" on the repatriation of prisoners of war proposed by the US side at the administrative meeting is essentially an unreasonable insistence on its absurd claim of "voluntary repatriation."
    On the one hand, the US side insists on its absurd claim of so-called "voluntary repatriation," and on the other hand, it has been abusing, persecuting, and massacring our captured personnel on a large scale in its prisoner-of-war camps, and plotting to detain our captured personnel in order to send them to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandit gangs. On February 18th, US personnel conducted so-called "individual interrogations" of our captured personnel in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp, forcing "screening." Although the American aggressors used all kinds of vicious intimidation methods, they still failed to subdue our captured personnel, so the American aggressors carried out a large-scale massacre of our captured personnel. On March 13th, the American aggressors carried out the same massacre again. The large-scale massacre of our captured personnel by the American aggressors has once again proved that the US side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" proposal on the fourth agenda item of the negotiations is extremely absurd and contains a vicious conspiracy. Not only that, the American aggressors colluded with the special agents of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the US prisoner-of-war camps in Busan and Geoje Island to intensify their conspiracy activities in order to create "conditions" for them to send our volunteer army captured personnel to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The American aggressors are now preparing to transport our volunteer army captured personnel to Taiwan on a large scale. It is obvious that the purpose of this conspiracy plan of the American aggressors is to force our volunteer army captured personnel to participate in the new war of aggression that the United States is preparing, which poses a serious threat to the future of the negotiations.
    Everyone knows that the American aggressors were forced to accept the armistice negotiations after their military adventure of invading Korea suffered continuous and heavy blows from the Korean and Chinese People's Forces, and was destined to fail. However, in the negotiations, the US side has shamelessly looked for excuses to repeatedly and unreasonably delay and obstruct the negotiations, preventing the negotiations from reaching an agreement in a timely manner. Moreover, while delaying and obstructing the negotiations, the American aggressors, in violation of human justice and international law, have sent planes to continuously spread various poisonous insects carrying bacteria on a large scale in Korea and Northeast China and Qingdao since January 28th. If there are still people who do not fully understand why the American aggressors are delaying and obstructing the negotiations, then the facts now very clearly show that the purpose of the American aggressors in delaying the negotiations and obstructing them is to prepare to adopt the most cruel means, using the inhuman bacteriological warfare, to save their irretrievable defeat, and attempt to continue to expand the war of aggression against Korea.
    The entire aggressive plan of the American aggressors is bound to fail completely. Today, if the American aggressors do not abandon their attitude of delaying and obstructing the negotiations, accept our fair and reasonable proposals, and enable the negotiations to reach a full agreement as soon as possible; if they do not immediately stop the criminal bacteriological warfare and the conspiracy to continue to expand the war of aggression against Korea, they will inevitably suffer a more tragic defeat. The Chinese and Korean People's Armies are ready to give the American aggressors even heavier blows at any time.

### 美国仍在继续拖延和阻挠朝鲜停战谈判

    美国仍在继续拖延和阻挠朝鲜停战谈判
    朝鲜停战谈判自从去年十一月二十七日第二项议程达成协议，并相继进入第三、第四和第五项议程的讨论以来，已经四个月了。在此期间，除第五项议程已获得原则协议外，由于美方坚持其荒谬主张，百般阻挠，第三、第四两项议程仍迟迟未能取得全部协议。
    第三和第四两项议程的谈判，由于我方的一再努力，在许多问题上已获相当的协议，但其中仍然存在着两个主要的分歧，这就是美方所一手造成的所谓中立国提名问题和战俘释放与遣返原则问题。美方在这两个问题上继续施展拖延与狡赖的手法，是第三和第四两项议程未能全部获得协议的主要原因。
    在第三项议程中关于中立国监察委员会的组成问题上，我方于二月十六日提出了苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克为我方所邀请的组成中立国监察委员会的三个中立国家，但美方却毫无理由地反对我方提名苏联为中立国，而为拖延和阻挠谈判设下了新的障碍。美方的无理态度是我们不能容忍的。就照美方自己提出的协定草案第三十八款的规定，所谓中立国家的定义，是“其战斗部队未曾参加在朝鲜的敌对行为的国家”，而我方所提的三个国家在朝鲜根本没有一兵一卒，完全符合于这个定义所规定的中立国的资格的。美方在毫无理由的情况下找出了两个所谓“理由”来，说什么苏联“邻近朝鲜”，又说什么苏联“过去有参预朝鲜问题的记录”，所以苏联不能参加中立国监察委员会。这两点所谓理由是根本违反原则协议的。美方没有任何根据来证明苏联邻近朝鲜的事实就足以撤除它的中立国的身份。至于说苏联过去有参预朝鲜问题的记录，所以不是中立国，这更是说不通的。因为问题不在于苏联是否有参预朝鲜问题的记录，而是在于是什么样的记录！苏联参预朝鲜问题的记录是什么呢？那就是苏联从日本法西斯手里解放朝鲜人民的记录；是从美国发动侵略朝鲜战争以来，苏联坚决反对干涉朝鲜战争和主张和平解决朝鲜问题的记录。苏联在联合国大会和联合国安全理事会中屡次提出公正的建议，主张朝鲜交战双方立即停战，定期撤退一切外国军队，以便和平解决朝鲜问题，而且朝鲜停战谈判的举行也是由苏联驻联合国代表马立克提议促成的。苏联对和平解决朝鲜问题的努力，曾受到世界各国人民包括美英人民的一致支持。苏联参预朝鲜问题的这些记录，不但不妨碍它成为中立国家，恰恰相反，正由于这种记录，苏联比任何国家都更应该被邀请参加中立国监察委员会。这种记录也恰恰证明了美国的反对是毫无理由的。为了迅速达成第三项议程的全部协议，我方于二月十八日第三项议程的参谋会议上，建议双方同时并一次对另一方的全部提名同意，或者双方各自提名三个中立国家而不进行任何同意手续。然而，直到目前为止，美方对我方这种公平合理的方案还未接受，这只能说明他们是蓄意拖延和阻挠停战谈判，而不能有其他的解释。
    在讨论第四项议程中，我方一直认为双方可以而且应该以已经交换的关于双方战俘材料为基础，首先确定双方在停战后释放与遣返全部战俘的原则。然而美方一直在战俘问题上玩弄诡计，阴谋扣留我方被俘人员。美方为了达到这种凶恶的目的，在谈判中坚持所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，使战俘的遣返问题成为第四项议程中的主要障碍。美方所坚持的“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，就连美国的反动记者李普曼也认为“在法律上（指日内瓦公约）是站不住脚的”。为了排除这一障碍，我方在三月二十一日第四项议程的参谋会议上，具体建议在停战协定签字并生效后，双方各自释放并遣返其现在所收容的战俘。并且，我方同意美方的建议，从三月二十五日起，第四项议程参谋会议进入行政性会议。双方协议，在行政会议期间，会议所讨论的内容只限于双方官方知悉，而不向新闻界发表。然而在行政会议举行的第一天，美方就违反协议，由李奇微总部将会议内容透露给路透社记者，授意其进行片面的宣传。但是从李奇微总部的片面宣传中也可以看出，美方在行政会议上提出的关于遣返战俘的所谓“折衷解决办法”的“新”建议，实质上仍然是无理坚持其“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张。
    美方一方面坚持其所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，一方面又在其战俘营中百般虐待、迫害和大规模屠杀我方被俘人员，并阴谋扣留我方被俘人员，以便送交蒋介石和李承晚匪帮。二月十八日，美方人员在巨济岛战俘营中对我方被俘人员进行了所谓“个别讯问”，强迫实行“甄别”。尽管美国侵略者施用了一切凶恶的威吓手段，但仍未能使我方被俘人员屈服，于是美国侵略者就对我方被俘人员进行了大规模的屠杀。三月十三日，美国侵略者又进行了一次同样的屠杀。美国侵略者大规模地屠杀我方被俘人员，又证明了美方在谈判的第四项议程上的所谓“自愿遣返”的提案，是极端荒谬并包含着毒辣的阴谋的。不仅如此，美国侵略者并勾结蒋介石匪帮的特务在釜山和巨济岛美方战俘营中加紧阴谋活动，以便为他们将我志愿军被俘人员送交蒋介石匪帮制造“条件”。美国侵略者现在正准备将我志愿军被俘人员大规模地向台湾运送。美国侵略者这种阴谋计划，很明显的，其目的是为了强迫我志愿军被俘人员参加美国所正在准备的新的侵略战争，这给谈判前途造成了严重的威胁。
    大家都知道，美国侵略者是在它侵略朝鲜的军事冒险遭受朝中人民部队不断的沉重的打击，而注定了失败的命运的情况下，被迫接受停战谈判的。但是在谈判中，美方又百般无耻地找寻藉口，屡次蛮横无理地拖延和阻挠谈判，使谈判不能及时获得协议。而且，在拖延和阻挠谈判的同时，美国侵略者竟违反人类正义和国际公法，自一月二十八日起，又派飞机连续在朝鲜和我国东北与青岛等地区大量散放各种带有细菌的毒虫。如果还有人不完全明了美国侵略者为什么要拖延和阻挠谈判的话，那末，现在事实就非常明显地说明：美国侵略者拖延谈判和阻挠的目的，就是为了准备采用最残酷的手段，以灭绝人性的细菌战争，来挽救他们无法挽救的败局，企图继续扩大侵略朝鲜的战争。
    美国侵略者的全部侵略计划是一定要彻底失败的。今天，美国侵略者如果不放弃其拖延和阻挠谈判的态度，接受我方公平合理的建议，使谈判早日达成全部协议；如果不立即停止罪恶的细菌战和继续扩大侵略朝鲜战争的阴谋，它就必然会遭到更加悲惨的失败。中朝人民军队随时准备给予美国侵略者以更重的打击。
