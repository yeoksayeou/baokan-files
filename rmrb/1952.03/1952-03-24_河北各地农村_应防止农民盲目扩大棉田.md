    Rural Areas of Hebei Should Prevent Farmers from Blindly Expanding Cotton Fields
    To the Editors: When we went to rural areas in Hebei to investigate agricultural tax issues, we found that many farmers were blindly expanding cotton fields. Here are two examples: In Beizhoujia Village, Seventh District, Shulu County, the government called for planting more winter wheat last year, but few farmers planted wheat, leaving the land to wait for planting cotton this year. For example, farmer Xu Jin-san planted 7.5 mu of cotton last year and plans to double the cotton field area this year; farmer Kong Lizhu planted 2.9 mu of cotton last year and plans to increase it to 5 mu this year. In Wujia Village, Ding County, cotton fields accounted for 34.68% of the village's cultivated land last year and are planned to be expanded to 45% this year.
    Deputy Prime Minister Chen Yun of the State Council said very clearly in his "Report on Economic and Financial Work" at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last October: "The sown area of ​​grain and industrial raw material crops in our country next year should be stabilized at this year's level, and the sown area of ​​grain must not be reduced. In particular, the blind expansion of cotton fields must be strictly prevented. The basic policy of agricultural production in 1952 is: Concentrate efforts to increase the yield per unit area." Therefore, I suggest that rural cadres in various places pay attention to this matter quickly, strengthen publicity and education to farmers, prevent "blind expansion of cotton fields" and "reduction of grain sown area," and implement the basic policy of agricultural production in 1952.

    Editor's note: People's governments at all levels must strictly prevent the phenomenon of farmers blindly expanding cotton fields. Leading cadres at all levels in cotton-producing areas should explain to the masses that the country needs a large increase in the production of both cotton and grain, but currently emphasis should be placed on increasing the yield per unit area, rather than expanding the cultivated area. In particular, the planting area of ​​grain crops should not be reduced due to planting more cotton. Many farmers still blindly hold the idea of ​​expanding cotton fields, because the agricultural production policy has not been deeply publicized and implemented. Leading organs in various cotton-producing areas must attach importance to this issue and strengthen publicity and education work in this regard.

### 河北各地农村  应防止农民盲目扩大棉田

    河北各地农村
    应防止农民盲目扩大棉田
    编辑同志：我们到河北各地农村去调查研究农业税问题时，发现不少农民盲目扩大棉田。举两个例子：在束鹿县七区北周家庄，去年政府号召多种冬麦，但农民种麦的不多，都留着地等待今年播种棉花。如农民许进三去年种棉花七亩半，计划今年棉田面积要扩大一倍；农民孔立柱去年种棉花二亩九分，计划今年要增种到五亩。定县吴家庄去年全村棉田占全村耕地的百分之三四点六八，计划今年要扩大到百分之四十五。
    政务院陈云副总理去年十月在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上“关于经济工作和财政工作的报告”中说得很明白：“明年我国粮食和工业原料作物播种的面积应该稳定于今年的水平，决不能减少粮食播种面积，特别要严格防止棉田的盲目扩大。一九五二年农业生产的基本方针是：集中力量提高单位面积的产量。”因此我建议各地农村干部迅速注意这件事，并加强对农民的宣传教育，防止“棉田的盲目扩大”和“减少粮食播种面积”，贯彻一九五二年农业生产的基本方针。

    编者按：各地人民政府对农民盲目扩大棉田的现象必须严格防止。棉产区的各级领导干部，应向群众说明：棉花和粮食，国家都需要大量增产，但目前应强调提高单位面积产量，而不是扩大耕地面积。特别不应该因多种棉花而减少粮食作物的种植面积。现在不少农民还盲目地抱着扩大棉田的思想，这是因为农业生产的政策还没有被深入宣传和贯彻执行的缘故。各棉产区领导机关必须重视这个问题，加强这方面的宣传教育工作。
