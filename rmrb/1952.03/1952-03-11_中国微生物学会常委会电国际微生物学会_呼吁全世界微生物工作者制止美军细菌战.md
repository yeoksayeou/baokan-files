    Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: The Standing Committee of the Chinese Society for Microbiology sent a telegram to the General Assembly of the International Association of Microbiological Societies, calling on microbiologists worldwide to take concerted action to stop the crimes of the American invading forces in conducting germ warfare. The text of the telegram is as follows: Professor Fang Zeika, President of the General Assembly of the International Association of Microbiological Societies:
    Since January 28 of this year, the American invading forces have not only continuously used bacteriological weapons on a large scale in Korea, but from February 29 to March 5, they have even more unscrupulously invaded our Northeast airspace and spread a large number of insects carrying bacteria, attempting to expand the Korean War and threaten world peace. This inhuman crime violates international law and the solemn resolution of the Fourth Congress of the International Association of Microbiological Societies to prohibit the use of bacteria in warfare. It is also intolerable to peace-loving and just people all over the world. We microbiologists study microorganisms to prevent disease and benefit mankind. However, the American imperialists are using the knowledge accumulated by microbiologists all over the world to cruelly harm the Chinese and Korean soldiers and peaceful residents of China and Korea who are fighting for justice. We lodge a serious protest against the American aggressors' criminal acts of using bacteria to massacre human beings, and appeal to your association to call on microbiologists all over the world to take concerted action to stop this heinous crime.
    Tang Feifan, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Society for Microbiology

    呼吁全世界微生物工作者制止美军细菌战
    【新华社十日讯】中国微生物学会常务委员会致电国际微生物学会总会，呼吁全世界微生物工作者一致行动制止美国侵略军进行细菌战的罪行。电文如下：国际微生物学会总会会长方寨卡教授：
    美国侵略军不仅在本年一月二十八日以后连续在朝鲜大规模使用细菌武器，并且在二月二十九日至三月五日更肆无忌惮地侵入我东北领空大量撒布负荷细菌的昆虫，妄图扩大朝鲜战争，威胁世界和平。这种灭绝人性的罪行，是破坏国际公法及国际微生物学会第四届大会所作禁止利用细菌作战的庄严决议，也是全世界爱好和平与正义的人民所不能容忍的。我们微生物学工作者，研究微生物是防止疾病为人类造福；而美帝国主义竟利用全世界微生物学者所积累的知识，来残害我们为正义而战的中朝战士及中朝的和平居民，我们对美国侵略者利用细菌进行虐杀人类的罪恶行为，提出严重的抗议，并吁请贵会号召全世界微生物工作者，采取一致行动制止这种滔天罪行。
    中国微生物学会常务委员会主任委员汤飞凡
