    Dong Youth Long Lianshou
    Protests American Imperialism's Spreading of Germs
    Comrade Editor: I am a Dong youth who was once imprisoned in a remote mountain area by three major enemies. After liberation, thanks to the People's Government's great ethnic policies, I was able to come to the people's capital and study by Chairman Mao's side.
    When I saw the inhumane American imperialists constantly spreading insects carrying germs in the Korean front and rear and in Northeast China, my blood boiled. I request the organization to allow me to go to the front lines in Korea and fight the American aggressors to the end.

    侗族青年龙连寿
    抗议美帝国主义撒布细菌
    编辑同志：我是一个曾经被三大敌人拘禁在穷山僻壤的侗族青年。解放后，因为人民政府伟大的民族政策，使我能够来到人民的首都，到了毛主席的身边进行学习。
    当我看到绝灭人性的美帝国主义者不断地在朝鲜前后方和我国东北撒布带有细菌的昆虫时，我的血就沸腾了。我请求组织上允许我到朝鲜最前线去，对美国侵略者斗争到底。
