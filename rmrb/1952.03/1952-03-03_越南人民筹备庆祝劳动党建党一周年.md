They are also preparing to launch a short-term competition from March 3rd to May 19th, in order to achieve results as gifts for President Ho Chi Minh's birthday.

The main contents of this short-term competition movement are as follows: In factories, workers should launch a short-term competition movement to overfulfill their production targets. In rural areas, the people should prepare to formulate a short-term competition plan to complete the government's 1952 production and savings plan.

    【新华社二日讯】据越南通讯社北越消息：越南全国人民正与越南劳动党及越南国民联合战线地方委员会干部合作，共同来完成庆祝越南劳动党建党、“越盟”和“越联”合并及越南、寮国、高棉三国人民成立联合民族统一战线一周年纪念的筹备工作。三月三日的周年纪念有其重大意义，因为纪念的目的是加强这个先锋政党——劳动党与人民之间的关系，加强它对人民的领导，进一步巩固越南人民的团结以及越南、寮国、高棉三国人民间的团结，同时并推进他们现在正在执行的中心任务。
    为了庆祝即将到来的纪念日，越南人民和军队在欢庆最近在和平和北越其他战场取得的胜利之余，正在积极相互竞赛，要得到进一步的成就，作为献给劳动党、越南国民联合战线和越南、寮国、高棉人民联盟的礼物。他们还准备发动从三月三日起至五月十九日为止的短期竞赛，借以取得成绩，作为给胡志明主席的诞辰礼物。
    这个短期竞赛运动的主要内容如下：在工厂中，工人应发动超额完成他们的生产目标的短期竞赛运动。在农村中，人民应准备拟订完成政府的一九五二年生产节约计划的短期竞赛计划。在军队中，战士应展开竞赛，继续杀敌，扩大在和平取得的胜利，在红河三角洲地区、中部地区以及全国其他战场进行游击战。在敌人后方，人民应就执行当地人民政府为他们布置的主要任务中的一项任务展开竞赛，例如在乡村建立游击队，建立设防的村庄，进行反对强征傀儡军队和拉壮丁的运动等。在政府组织中，政府人员除了应准备拟订竞赛计划以外，还应在许多方面进行检查。在若干地区，党组织应准备向人民报告从执行任务以来进行主要工作的情况。
