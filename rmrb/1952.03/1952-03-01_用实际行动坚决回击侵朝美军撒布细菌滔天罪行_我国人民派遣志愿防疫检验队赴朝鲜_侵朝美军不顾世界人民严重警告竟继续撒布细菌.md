Xinhua News Agency, 29th -- In order to counter the American imperialists’ provocative act of spreading bacteria in Korea with practical actions, Chinese medical and health science professionals have formed a Volunteer Anti-Epidemic Inspection Team to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. The first group departed from Beijing by plane on February 29th to conduct epidemic prevention work in Korea. This powerful anti-epidemic inspection team is composed of bacteriology experts Professor Yang Shuya, Associate Professor Fang Liang, Professor Guo Chengzhou, Professor Xie Zhimo, parasitology expert Professor Wu Guang, entomology expert Professor Liu Zhiying, epidemiology expert Professor Yu Huanwen, pathology expert Professor Yan Jiagui, and lecturers, teaching assistants, and technicians from medical schools in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hangzhou, and other places, numbering in the dozens. Among those who went to the airport to see off the anti-epidemic inspection team were: Honorary Chairman of the Chinese Medical Association He Cheng, Secretary-General of the Chinese People’s Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Liu Guanyi, Vice Presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Zhu Kezhen and Wu Youxun, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese Red Cross Society Ni Feijun, and writer Liu Baiyu, among others, totaling dozens.

As early as February 22nd, when newspapers across the country revealed the news of the American aggressors spreading bacteria in Korea, it immediately aroused extreme anger among the people of the whole country. Medical and health science workers in various places requested to personally go to the front lines in Korea to wage a resolute struggle against the despicable and shameless enemy. More than 200 faculty members and students of the Peking University School of Medicine jointly requested to depart for the front lines in Korea. All the students of the Department of Bacteriology of Shanghai Medical College, under the leadership of Professor Lin Feiqing, Chairman of the Department, held a meeting to protest the heinous crimes of American imperialism and passed a resolution to "respond to the call of the motherland at any time and fight the schemers who endanger mankind to the end." After the Chinese Medical Association issued a notice on February 26th to organize an anti-epidemic inspection team to resist US aggression and aid Korea, it immediately received an enthusiastic response from medical workers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places. Within three days, the first group of the inspection and epidemic prevention team was formed. All the team members made thorough preparations before departure. Associate Professor Fang Liang of the Department of Bacteriology of Peking University School of Medicine prepared various medicines and equipment overnight. The famous parasitology expert Professor Wu Guang departed from Shanghai the day after the call from the Chinese Medical Association, carrying a large number of medicines and equipment. He said: "The glorious task has finally come upon me. What we have been pursuing all our lives is to eliminate various infectious diseases and maintain human health, but American imperialism uses poisonous insects to kill people, which makes me further recognize the essence of American imperialism. Scientists love their motherland and love justice. I will definitely contribute all my strength to the place where the motherland and human justice need it most."

Before the departure of the anti-epidemic inspection team, a grand send-off meeting was held at the airport. He Cheng delivered a warm send-off speech to all the team members, encouraging everyone to give full play to their combat strength, and to completely eliminate the bacteria spread by American imperialism for the sake of the motherland and the Korean people. Zhu Kezhen gave a speech encouraging all team members to carry forward the fighting will of scientific workers who love the motherland and pursue the truth, and to successfully complete this glorious and arduous task. All the team members unanimously expressed: they are determined to complete the glorious task entrusted to them by the people of the motherland, and completely eliminate the bacteria spread by the American aggressors in Korea. Finally, all the team members took off by plane in the soaring slogans of "We will definitely guarantee the elimination of the bacteria spread by American imperialism" and "Guarantee to complete the great and glorious task and return."

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 29th -- Our front-line reporter reported: From February 17th to 25th, military aircraft of the American invading army continued to frantically spread various poisonous insects carrying bacteria over our front-line positions and rear areas in Korea.

On February 17th, American military aircraft dropped a bacterial bomb on the east side of Penglai Lake, southeast of Ichon, which scattered a lot of flies after the explosion.

On February 18th, American aircraft scattered many flies in the Hanpuli (south of Namcheon-myeon) area.

On February 19th, American aircraft dropped insects similar to flies in Fengming-ri, Batjung-ri, and Yongbong-ri northwest of Sukchon, and Balipyong and Sangsipripyeong northeast of Sukchon, with each area spread covering approximately 300 to 1,000 square meters, with as many as 100 and as few as seven or eight poisonous insects per square meter.

On February 20th, American aggressor troops spread insects similar to flies on our army's position in Baishidong, northeast of Guhwari.

On February 22nd, American aircraft dropped five bombs in the Seokwangsa and Nofukri areas north of Singosan, south of Wonsan, two of which exploded, scattering a large number of flies.

On February 23rd, many black flies dropped by American aircraft were found near Suhapri, southeast of Sibyeon-ri.

On February 24th, American aircraft scattered leaflets in the deep valley northeast of Guhwari and on Hill 131, with lice-like poisonous insects attached to the leaflets.

On February 25th, flies dropped by American aircraft were found near Baekseok-ri, north of Sukchon. The insect had a small head, white spots under its wings, and a sticky substance on its claws. A mosquito was also found in the area with a small abdomen and white spots.

The American aggressors, disregarding the serious warnings of righteous people all over the world, continue to commit heinous crimes of bacteriological warfare in Korea, which has aroused even greater anger from the Korean military and civilians and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The military and civilians in various places have been mobilized in earnest to quickly extinguish the poisonous insects that have landed on the ground by various means, and vigorously carry out prevention and disinfection work.

The Korean people and the Korean-Chinese people's forces unanimously believe that the American aggressors must bear full responsibility for all the crimes they have committed in Korea. If the American aggressors do not immediately stop their crazy and brutal crimes, they must suffer the consequences of their crimes.

    侵朝美军不顾世界人民严重警告竟继续撒布细菌
    【新华社二十九日讯】为了用实际行动回击美帝国主义在朝鲜撒布细菌的挑衅行为，我国医药卫生科学界人士，组成了抗美援朝志愿防疫检验队，首批已于二月二十九日乘飞机自北京启程，赴朝鲜进行防疫工作。这一强大的防疫检验队，是由细菌学专家杨叔雅教授、方亮副教授、郭成周教授、谢知母教授，寄生虫学专家吴光教授，昆虫学专家柳支英教授，流行性病学专家俞焕文教授，病理学专家严家贵教授，及北京、上海、天津、杭州等地医科学校的讲师助教及技术人员数十人组成的。前往机场欢送防疫检验队的有：中华医学会总会名誉理事长贺诚，中国人民抗美援朝总会秘书长刘贯一，中国科学院副院长竺可桢、吴有训，中国红十字会总会副秘书长倪斐君，及作家刘白羽等数十人。
    早在二月二十二日，各地报纸披露了美国侵略者在朝鲜撒布细菌的消息后，立即引起全国人民的极度愤怒。各地医药卫生科学工作者纷纷要求亲赴朝鲜前线，和卑鄙无耻的敌人进行坚决的斗争。北京大学医学院二百多名师生，联名要求出发到朝鲜前线。上海医学院细菌系全体同学，在系主任林飞卿教授领导下，召开了大会，抗议美帝国主义的滔天罪行，并通过了“随时响应祖国号召，与危害人类的阴谋者斗争到底”的决议。中华医学会总会于二月二十六日发出组织抗美援朝检验防疫队的通知后，立刻获得北京、上海、天津等地医药工作者的热烈响应。三天之内，检验防疫队首批即已组成。全体队员在出发之前，都进行了周密的准备工作。北京大学医学院细菌系方亮副教授连夜准备各种药品器械。著名的寄生虫专家吴光教授在中华医药学会总会号召的第二天，即携带大批药品器材，自上海出发，他说：“光荣的任务终于临到我身上了。我们一生孜孜以求的是为了扑灭各种传染病，维护人类的健康，而美帝国主义却用有毒的昆虫杀人，这使我进一步认清了美帝国主义的本质。科学家是爱祖国、爱正义的，我一定把自己的一切力量，贡献给祖国和人类正义最需要的地方。”
    防疫检验队出发前，人们在机场上举行了隆重的欢送会。贺诚向全体队员致热烈的欢送词，勉励大家充分发挥战斗力量，为了祖国，为了朝鲜人民，彻底消灭美帝国主义撒布的细菌。竺可桢讲话勉励全体队员，发扬科学工作者热爱祖国、追求真理的战斗意志，胜利地完成这个光荣而又艰巨的任务。全体队员一致表示：决心完成祖国人民付托给自己的光荣任务，彻底扑灭美国侵略者在朝鲜撒布的细菌。最后，全体队员在高昂的“我们一定保证消灭美帝国主义撒布的细菌”，“保证完成伟大光荣的任务归来”的口号声中，乘机凌空而去。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十九日电】本社前线记者报道：自二月十七日至二十五日，美国侵略军的军用飞机竟继续在朝鲜我军前线阵地和后方的上空，疯狂撒放传布细菌的各种毒虫。
    二月十七日，美军飞机在伊川东南蓬莱湖东侧投下细菌弹一枚，爆炸后散出很多苍蝇。
    二月十八日，美机在汉浦里（南川店南）地区撒下许多苍蝇。
    二月十九日，美机在肃川西北凤明里、钵中里、龙奉里和肃川东北八里坪、上十里坪投下类似苍蝇的昆虫，每处散布面积约三百至一千平方公尺，每平方公尺内的毒虫多到一百余个，少则七八个。
    二月二十日，美国侵略军在九化里东北之白石洞我军阵地撒布类似苍蝇的昆虫。
    二月二十二日，美机在元山以南新高山北之释王寺、芦福里地区投弹五枚，其中两枚已爆炸，散出大批苍蝇。
    二月二十三日，市边里东南之水合里附近同时发现美机投下的许多黑色苍蝇。
    二月二十四日，美机在九化里东北深谷及一三一高地撒下传单，传单上附有虱子似的毒虫。
    二月二十五日，肃川北白石里附近发现美机投下的苍蝇，该虫头小，翅下有白点，爪上有黏液状物。该地又发现一种蚊子，腹小，有白点。
    美国侵略者不顾全世界正义人类的严重警告继续在朝鲜从事细菌战争的滔天罪行，已激起朝鲜军民和中国人民志愿军的更大愤怒。各地军民已紧张动员起来，用各种方法迅速扑灭落地不久的毒虫，并大力进行预防与消毒工作。
    朝鲜人民和朝中人民部队一致认为：美国侵略者对于他们在朝鲜所造下的一切罪行要负完全的责任。如果美国侵略者不立即停止疯狂残暴的罪行，他们就必须自食其罪行的恶果。
