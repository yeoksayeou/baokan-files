    Protest the outrageous crimes of the American aggressors
    National Industrial Labor Model Zhao Zhankui
    With boundless anger, I lodge a serious protest against the American bandits!
    The American aggressor troops not only spread bacteria on the Korean front and in the rear, but also, regardless of the just cries of the people of our country and the world, unscrupulously spread bacteria within our country and indiscriminately bombed and strafed. The American bandits, disregarding international law and the condemnation of the people of the world, continue to carry out inhumane germ warfare in an attempt to massively murder the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers and peaceful residents. This is enough to prove that American imperialism has reached its wit's end.
    The heinous and audacious crime of the American bandits in blatantly expanding the war of aggression is intolerable to the people of our country and the world. Our entire working class resolutely supports the solemn statement issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai regarding this incident. We demand that the working classes of the world, especially our American and Japanese worker brothers, condemn and denounce this shameless crime of the American bandits, raise our axes, and chop off the bloody hands of the American bandits!
    We firmly believe that the powerful forces of peace in the world will inflict a fatal blow on any aggressor, and victory will always belong to us peace-loving people.
    I urge our entire working class to enthusiastically respond to the call of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, use our practical actions to strengthen the power of resisting America and aiding Korea, support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and crush the shameless conspiracies of the American imperialists to protect the safety of the peace-loving people of Asia and the world.
    Give the germ warfare criminals a thorough blow
    Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Christian Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement Wu Yaozong
    The ferocious American aggressors are waging germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China. All patriotic Christians in China absolutely cannot tolerate this heinous crime of the American aggressors, which is inhumane and violates international conventions. This insane and barbaric crime of the American aggressors completely and thoroughly exposes the essence of their aggression. The crimes of the American aggressors will surely be justly judged by the peace-loving people of the world. I firmly support Minister Zhou Enlai's statement regarding this incident and call on all Christians in China to continue to strengthen the patriotic action of resisting America and aiding Korea, actively promote the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement of Christianity, resolutely sever all ties with American imperialism, eliminate the ideological toxins of American imperialism within Christianity, and give the germ warfare criminals a thorough blow.

    坚决扑灭美国侵略者细菌战的毒焰
    抗议美国侵略者的无耻暴行
    全国工业劳动模范　赵占魁
    我以无比的愤怒心情，向美国强盗们提出严重的抗议！
    美国侵略军不仅在朝鲜前线和后方撒布细菌，而且不顾我国和全世界人民的正义吼声，肆无忌惮地在我国境内撒布细菌，并滥施轰炸扫射。美国强盗们如此不顾国际公法，不顾全世界人民的谴责，继续不断地进行灭绝人性的细菌战，企图大规模地杀害我中朝人民战士与和平居民。更足以证明美帝国主义已至黔驴技穷的绝境。
    美国强盗穷凶极恶敢于明目张胆扩大侵略战争的滔天罪行，是我国和全世界人民所不能容忍的，我们全国工人阶级坚决支持我国外交部周恩来部长对这一事件所发表的严正声明。并要求全世界工人阶级特别是美国和日本的工人阶级兄弟们，对美国强盗们的这种无耻的罪行，提出控诉和声讨，把我们的斧头举起，砍断美国强盗的血手！
    我们坚决相信，全世界强大的和平力量，必将给予任何侵略者以致命的打击，胜利永远是属于我们爱好和平的人们的。
    我要求我们全国工人阶级热烈地响应中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会和中华全国总工会的号召，用我们的实际行动来加强抗美援朝的力量，支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，粉碎美帝国主义者所进行的无耻阴谋，以保卫亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民的安全。
    给细菌战犯们以彻底打击
    中国基督教抗美援朝三自革新
    运动委员会筹备委员会主席  吴耀宗
    穷凶极恶的美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战。全中国爱国的基督教徒对于美国侵略者这种灭绝人性、破坏国际公约的滔天罪行，是绝对不能容忍的。美国侵略者这个疯狂的野蛮罪行，完全地彻底地暴露了它的侵略的本质。美国侵略者的罪行，必将受到全世界爱好和平人民的正义裁判。我坚决拥护周恩来部长关于这一事件的声明，并号召全中国基督教徒继续加强抗美援朝的爱国行动，积极地推进基督教的三自革新运动，坚决地割断和美帝国主义的一切联系，肃清基督教内美帝国主义的思想毒素，给予细菌战犯们以彻底的打击。
