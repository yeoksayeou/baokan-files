    Medical Workers Must Study Politics
    Editor: In the past, I often heard some medical personnel say: we are "humanitarians" who treat the sick and save lives; no matter who is sick, we must save him. When I first entered medical school, I also had this wrong idea, so I was never very enthusiastic about studying politics. When people talked about "who does technology serve?", it always felt "abstract and difficult to understand".

    The American imperialists barbarously and shamelessly launched a bacteriological war in Korea and Northeast China. The "abstract and difficult to understand" question I mentioned was clearly illuminated by this living fact.

    We all know that the great Doctor Bethune contributed his precious life to our motherland. We can also see that when the plague raged in Chahar Province in 1949, the Soviet anti-epidemic team extinguished the epidemic in a very short period of time. These living facts are forever remembered by us. Today, in the scientific community of our motherland, the vast number of medical workers have also shouted the slogan: "We are all warriors to eliminate bacteria!" determined to completely crush the bacteriological war of American imperialism.

    But in another corner of the world, a group of so-called "bacteriologists" who have lost their conscience are hiding. They heinously manufacture a large number of bacteriological weapons, and they have become accomplices and executioners of imperialism.

    Today, when I recall the situation in medical school where I was unwilling to study politics and could not understand the question of "who does technology serve," I feel infinitely ashamed. I am willing to unite closely with comrades in the medical community across the country and contribute all my strength to the great people's revolutionary cause.

### 医务工作者必须学习政治

    医务工作者必须学习政治
    编辑同志：过去我常听到有的医务人员说：我们是治病救人的“人道主义者”；不管谁患了病，就必须去拯救他。我在初进医学校的时候，也有这种错误的想法，所以对于学习政治总是不大热心。当人们谈到“技术为谁服务”的时候，总觉得那是“抽象难解”的。
    美帝国主义者残暴无耻地在朝鲜和我国东北发动了细菌战争。我所说的“抽象难解”的问题，被这个活生生的事实照得一清二楚了。
    我们大家都知道，伟大的白求恩大夫为了我们的祖国，贡献了他宝贵的生命。我们也可以看到，当一九四九年察北鼠疫猖獗的时候，苏联的防疫大队在极短的时间内，就扑灭了这种疫病。这些活生生的事实，都永远地被我们记忆着。今天在我们祖国的科学界，广大的医务工作者也喊出了：“我们都是扑灭细菌的战士！”的口号，决心彻底粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战争。
    但是在世界另一个角落里，却窝藏着一批丧尽天良的所谓“细菌学家”。他们伤天害理地制造大量的细菌武器，他们已经成了帝国主义的帮凶和刽子手。
    我今天想起在医学校中不愿学习政治，理解不了“技术为谁服务”这个问题的情形，感到无限的惭愧。我愿意和全国医学界的同志们紧密地团结起来，为伟大的人民革命事业而贡献一切力量。
