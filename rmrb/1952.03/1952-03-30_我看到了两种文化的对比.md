    I Saw the Contrast Between Two Cultures
    Molunsī
    I have heard witnesses describe to us the Americans' slaughter of the people. The extent and barbarity of the slaughter are almost unimaginable. I have personally seen the scars on the bodies of those victims who survived – burns from fire, wounds from beatings, and bullet wounds. We will write these facts in our report; we will let the whole world know these facts.

    In Korea, I saw the Americans, following their most cruel atrocities, adding another crime to their list: spreading infectious bacteria. The Korean men and women, in a life-or-death struggle, are rebuilding all the homes destroyed by the enemy, and still have courage and confidence. Such a people is bound to achieve victory.

    In Korea, I clearly saw the contrast between two methods of warfare, two cultures. On the one hand, imperialist planes are systematically destroying schools, churches, museums, and hospitals. On the other hand, the Korean government is building many underground schools. Not only are university courses proceeding as usual, but scientists are continuing their research in laboratories. The wounded and sick are being accommodated in newly established underground hospitals. The Korean government has also built a theater underground in Pyongyang. While the invaders continue their work of destruction, many valuable literary and artistic programs have been performed in that underground theater, and many report meetings and mass rallies have been held there. Some of our delegation members encountered a mobile theater troupe in a certain eastern province, which was preparing to perform for the farmers.

    On the one hand, there are barbaric people who nail iron nails into the head of a worker who has received the Labor Hero Medal from the Korean government (this is what witnesses told members of our delegation); these American barbarians also nailed many iron nails into the head of a female speaker, saying they wanted to see where her wisdom lay. But the Korean government not only rewards the merits of armed soldiers, but also the achievements of manual and cultural laborers.

    I have spoken with juvenile delinquents. They told me how the Americans, after beating them, ordered them to work as spies, to gather military and strategic intelligence. These children were caught on the spot by guerrillas.

    They are now all well-dressed, healthy, learning to write and read. Their situation is worlds apart from that in Western reformatories for juvenile delinquents; they cannot even imagine it.

    The Americans try to force them to betray their compatriots through beatings and intimidation, while the Korean government provides them with education and guidance, leading them onto the right path in life.

    I know that the above facts will not surprise you, because you have long understood what kind of people the Korean people are.

    In Pyongyang, we saw a moving film. The film showed the mass parade on the "May 1st" Labor Day in 1950. Women in colorful clothes were smiling, and the whole people were singing. Here I sincerely wish the Korean people peace and happiness soon, and to see its working people and youth marching in formation in the rebuilt city.

    When we return to our respective countries, we will do our best to fight, to expose the truth, to prevent batches of new soldiers from serving imperialism again, and to strengthen the struggle for peace.

    我看到了两种文化的对比
    莫伦斯
    我听过证人对我们叙述美国人残杀人民情形的报告。残杀范围的广泛和野蛮的程度是几乎不能想像的。那些幸免于死的牺牲者身上的伤痕，有火烫伤、毒打伤、枪弹伤，我都亲眼见过。我们要把这些事实写在我们的报告里面，我们要让全世界知道这些事实。
    在朝鲜，我看见了美国人继他们最残忍的暴行之后，在他们的罪状里又加上了另一条罪行，散布传染病菌。朝鲜的男男女女，在生命攸关的斗争中，重建着一切被敌人毁坏了的家园，仍有勇气有信心。这样的人民，是一定要取得胜利的。
    在朝鲜，我清楚地看到了两种作战方法，两种文化的对比。一方面，帝国主义的飞机在有计划地毁灭学校、教堂、博物院、医院。一方面，朝鲜政府在建筑许多地下的学校。不但大学的课程照常进行，科学家在实验室里也仍旧继续他们的研究。伤者病者，有地下新成立的医院加以收容。朝鲜政府还在平壤地下建筑了一座剧场。当侵略者继续他们的毁灭工作的时候，在那所地下剧场里，曾演出许多有价值的文艺节目，并在那里举行了多次报告大会和群众大会。我们有的团员在东部某省曾遇见一个流动剧团，他们是准备给农民去演剧的。
    一方面是野蛮人群，他们用铁钉钉在一个得过朝鲜政府劳动英雄章的劳动者的头上（这是证人们对本团团员说的）；这些美国野蛮人还曾用许多铁钉钉在一个女演说家的头上，说要看看她的智慧所在的中心。但朝鲜政府却不但奖励武装战士的功劳，而且奖励手工和文化劳动者的成绩。
    我曾和犯罪的儿童谈过话。他们告诉我美国人怎样在毒打他们之后，命令他们来作间谍工作，来刺探军事和战略情报。这些儿童是当场被游击队捕获的。
    他们现在都穿得很好，很康健，学写学念。他们的处境和西方圈禁犯罪儿童教养所里的情形有天渊之别，这是他们无法想像到的。
    美国人用毒打和恫吓的方法努力让他们出卖同胞，朝鲜政府则给他们以教养，让他们走上生活的正途。
    我知道上述的事实是不会使你们惊奇的，因为你们很久以前就了解朝鲜人民是怎样的人民。
    在平壤，我们曾看过一部动人的电影。影片映出了一九五○年“五一”节的群众游行。穿了鲜艳衣服的妇人笑着，全体人民唱着歌。我在此地竭诚地祝朝鲜人民不久就可以获得和平和幸福，可以看见它的劳动人民和青年在重建起来的城市里整队游行。
    我们回到我们各人的国内，必将尽我们的全力去奋斗，要把真情实况揭露出来，要阻止一批一批的新兵，不让他们再为帝国主义服务，要加强为和平的斗争。
