One of the keys to implementing the Marriage Law is to carry out publicity and education work among the masses in accordance with the spirit of the Marriage Law. In the past, many regions have achieved good results in this regard, so that the Marriage Law has been enthusiastically supported by the broad masses, especially women, and countless happy new families have emerged.

However, some places still do not attach importance to the publicity and education work of the Marriage Law. Some cadres, especially district and township (village) cadres and the masses, are influenced by feudal remnants and intentionally or unintentionally act as maintainers of the feudal marriage system, seriously hindering the correct implementation of the Marriage Law. Therefore, we should further carry out the publicity work of the Marriage Law, correct the deviations in the publicity work, and vigorously implement the Marriage Law.

Judging from the situation in various places, the following deviations should be corrected in the current publicity work of the Marriage Law:

One, daring not to publicize or hindering the publicity of the Marriage Law. They believe that marriage issues are "verbose" and "troublesome," and fear that after publicizing the Marriage Law, women will file for divorce, or fear that the publicity of the Marriage Law will affect the central work. A women cadre in Wendeng Special District, Shandong Province, was not praised for publicizing the Marriage Law, but was criticized, saying: "Why put so much effort into publicizing the Marriage Law! This is a social problem, and it cannot be solved in a day or two. We are too busy with the central work to have time to publicize it." Village cadres in a certain place in Hubei even wanted to detain the women representatives who publicized the Marriage Law.

Two, "blitzkrieg" publicity, coming like a storm and then everything is fine. They did not realize that overthrowing an old system and establishing a new system is an arduous task. Like other social reforms, the implementation of the Marriage Law must go through a long and fierce struggle. In particular, the feudal marriage system has a deep-rooted foundation among the masses for thousands of years, so it is necessary to constantly carry out publicity to the masses; only by raising the ideological awareness of the masses can the feudal marriage system be completely defeated.

Three, distorting the Marriage Law. Some areas publicize that the "widows have the freedom to remarry" stipulated in the Marriage Law as "all widows must remarry, otherwise they are not implementing the Marriage Law," which is not correct. This has caused dissatisfaction among widows in their forties and fifties. Some people publicize that "divorce is a matter for both parties, and one party cannot divorce if they do not want to," "divorce cannot be for nothing, the woman has to pay the man a remarriage fee," "after the divorce, the man cannot remarry, and the woman is not allowed to remarry." Some people also called for divorce at mass meetings, "Now there is freedom of marriage, whoever doesn't want to be with whom doesn't have to be with whom," "those who were married by their parents in the past must also divorce," "women must stand up and unite to make trouble for divorce." Some district cadres arranged this way: "Only marriage freedom is allowed to be publicized, divorce freedom is not allowed to be publicized." All of these have made the masses mistakenly believe that the Marriage Law is a "Divorce Law" or a "Women's Law," which has caused great dissatisfaction.

Four, lack of correct and comprehensive publicity. Many areas publicize the Marriage Law by only saying a few slogans such as "men and women should be equal," "marriage should be free," "if the relationship is not good, you can divorce," "abuse of women is not allowed," etc., thus causing many misunderstandings of the Marriage Law among the masses. More common is the belief that "freedom of marriage is messing around with relationships between men and women." A few bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying: "Widows are rewarded for giving birth to children, unmarried girls are awarded for giving birth to children, and married women throw their children into the toilet."

Five, the publicity is not universal and in-depth enough. Some people think that the publicity of the Marriage Law is a matter for women cadres, and male comrades can ignore it; or only publicize to women, or only publicize to young men and women, ignoring the publicity and education of middle-aged and elderly people; or think that the implementation of the Marriage Law is women's work, court work, and civil affairs work, and do not realize that this is a social reform work and a democratic construction work. Some only pay attention to towns and large villages, ignoring remote mountain villages and small villages.

In order to publicize the Marriage Law universally, deeply, comprehensively and correctly, in addition to strengthening the study of cadres in the future, the following suggestions are put forward based on the experience of various places:

One, be good at selecting typical marriage cases and use court public trials or going to the countryside for trials to carry out publicity. Pay attention to inviting representatives from the local democratic women's federation to sit in on the trial and absorb the broad masses and cadres to participate in the hearing and make necessary speeches. Some areas have already adopted this method and have achieved great results, not only educating the parties involved, but also educating the broad masses.

Two, carry out publicity through people's representative conferences. Make a special report on the implementation of the Marriage Law to the conference, and submit it to the representatives for discussion and review, and then propose implementation methods and formulate implementation resolutions.

Three, hold various small-scale symposiums. Such as mothers-in-law meetings, husbands meetings, mothers meetings, in addition to generally explaining the articles of the Marriage Law and pointing out the basic spirit of the Marriage Law, also educate them to change the old relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, husband and wife, and mother and child, and strive to be a good mother-in-law, a good husband, and a good mother in the new society.

Four, organize typical new-style weddings or organize free collective weddings in cities. This method has been started in the Northeast region, and some areas in Fujian and Zhejiang are holding it. Experience has proved that this method is very effective, not only vividly publicizing the Marriage Law, but also in line with the principle of economy. According to statistics from Harbin City in the past year, a total of 31 collective weddings were held, with 351 newly married couples. Each collective wedding was attended by many guests. At this time, the Marriage Law is publicized, and the wedding hall is turned into a publicity place, which is very effective.

Five, hold marriage problem exhibitions. This is a large-scale and easy-to-achieve publicity method. After preparation, Dalian City officially started the exhibition on January 28. It is divided into four rooms: (1) exposing the crimes of the feudal marriage system; (2) explaining the policies of new democratic marriage; (3) introducing new marriage relations and Soviet socialist marriage relations; (4) slides. A "Marriage Problem Answering Office" is also attached to specifically answer the audience's questions about marriage problems. The exhibition was warmly welcomed by the broad masses, who asked to take these exhibition materials to the countryside for mobile exhibitions. The exhibition is preparing to attach a trial room to cooperate with relevant departments to handle temporary marriage cases on the spot in conjunction with publicity exhibitions.

Six, write the full text of the Marriage Law in large regular script on the walls. Those who can read can understand it at a glance, and those who cannot read can understand it after listening to others read it. The eighth item of the resolution on the current ten tasks of the county people's government in the first county magistrate conference in North China clearly stipulates this method. This is completely correct. In addition to the full implementation of this in North China, other regions can also follow suit.

Seven, the publicity of the Marriage Law should be regarded as a regular work. We should use various occasions (such as winter schools, night schools, literacy classes, training classes, etc.) and adopt various methods (such as marriage law picture exhibitions, reading newspaper group discussions) to carry out publicity. And pay attention to using vivid examples to specifically explain the benefits of implementing the Marriage Law to oneself, to the family, and to the society. In addition, we should also thoroughly expose feudal ethical concepts and feudal remnants of thought that insult and discriminate against women through literary and artistic forms, and establish new moral and ethical concepts. And let the broad masses know that the Marriage Law is one of the fruits of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and is an important law.

We must ruthlessly expose and severely criticize the feudal remnants of thought that abuse women or interfere with marriage freedom in front of the masses, carry out patient publicity and education work among cadres and the masses, and implement the Marriage Law to the end.

    进一步做好婚姻法的宣传教育工作
    梁琮
    贯彻执行婚姻法的关键之一，是根据婚姻法的精神对群众进行宣传教育工作。过去，不少地区在这方面已取得良好成绩，因而使婚姻法受到广大群众尤其是妇女群众的热烈拥护，出现了无数的美满幸福的新家庭。
    但有些地方仍未重视婚姻法的宣传教育工作，部分干部特别是区、乡（村）干部及群众因封建残余思想作祟，有意无意地充当了封建婚姻制度的维护人，严重地阻碍着婚姻法的正确执行。因此，应进
    一步开展婚姻法的宣传工作，纠正宣传工作中的偏向，大力贯彻执行婚姻法。
    从各地情况来看，目前在婚姻法的宣传工作中，有以下几种偏向应该加以纠正：
    一、不敢大胆宣传或阻碍宣传婚姻法。他们认为婚姻问题“罗嗦”、“麻烦”，害怕宣传婚姻法之后，妇女提出离婚要求，或是怕因宣传婚姻法而影响中心工作。山东文登专区一个妇女干部宣传婚姻法，不但没受表扬，反被批评说：“宣传婚姻法还使那么多劲！这是社会问题，不是一天半天能解决的。中心工作还忙不来，那有工夫宣传它。”湖北某地的村干部甚至要把宣传婚姻法的妇女代表扣起来。
    二、“突击”式的宣传，来势如风，过后万事大吉。他们没有认识到推翻一种旧制度、建立一种新制度，是一个艰巨的任务。正如其他社会改革一样，贯彻执行婚姻法须经过长期的激烈的斗争。特别是封建婚姻制度，几千年来在群众中有根深柢固的基础，所以，必须经常地对群众进行宣传；只有提高了群众的思想觉悟，才能彻底打垮封建婚姻制度。
    三、歪曲婚姻法。有的地区把婚姻法规定的“寡妇有再婚的自由”，宣传为“凡是寡妇都得另嫁，否则就是不执行婚姻法”，这是不对的。这曾引起四、五十岁的寡妇的不满。有人宣传“离婚是双方的事，一方不愿意就不能离”，“不能白离婚，女方得给男方续娶费”，“离婚后男的不娶，女的不准改嫁”。也有人在群众大会上号召离婚，“现在婚姻自由了，谁不想跟谁就不跟谁”，“在过去父母包办结婚的也都要离”，“妇女要翻身，团结起来闹离婚”。也有的区干部这样布置：“只准宣传结婚自由，不准宣传离婚自由”。这些，都使群众错误地认为婚姻法是“离婚法”或“妇女法”，产生了极大的不满。
    四、缺乏正确全面的宣传。不少地区宣传婚姻法，只说“男女要平等”、“婚姻要自由”、“感情不好可以离婚”、“不准虐待妇女”等几句口号，因此在群众中造成了很多误解婚姻法的情形。较普遍的是认为“婚姻自由就是乱搞男女关系”。少数坏分子就乘机造谣说：“寡妇生孩子受赏，大姑娘生孩子得奖，有夫之妇生孩子丢下毛厕缸。”
    五、宣传不够普遍深入。有的认为宣传婚姻法是妇女干部的事，男同志可以不过问；或只对妇女宣传，或只对青年男女宣传，忽视了对中年人、老年人进行宣传教育；或认为贯彻执行婚姻法是妇女工作、法院工作、民政工作，没有认识到这是一个社会改革工作、民主建设工作。有的只注意城镇及大的村庄，忽视了偏僻的山村和小庄。
    为普遍深入全面正确地宣传婚姻法，今后除应加强干部的学习以外，根据各地的经验提出如下几点意见：
    一、善于选择典型婚姻案件，利用法庭公审或下乡就审方式进行宣传。要注意邀请当地民主妇女联合会派人陪审，吸取广大群众及干部参加旁听，和作必要的发言。有的地区已经采用这一办法，收效很大，不但教育了当事人，而且也教育了广大群众。
    二、通过人民代表会议进行宣传。把婚姻法执行情况向大会作专题报告，并交代表讨论审查，然后提出执行的办法，订出贯彻的决议。
    三、召开各种小型座谈会。如婆婆会、丈夫会、母亲会，在会上除一般讲解婚姻法的条文，指出婚姻法的基本精神以外，并教育她（他）们改变旧的婆媳关系、夫妇关系、母子关系，争取做一个新社会的好婆婆，好丈夫，好母亲。
    四、组织典型新式结婚或在城市组织免费集体结婚。这种方法在东北区已开始实行，福建、浙江部分地区正在举办。经验证明，这种方法收效很大，不但生动地宣传了婚姻法，而且也符合节约的原则。根据哈尔滨市一年来的统计，共举行三十一次集体结婚，新婚夫妇三百五十一对。每次集体结婚时，都有很多来宾参加。这时即进行婚姻法的宣传，变结婚礼堂为宣传场所，收效很大。
    五、举办婚姻问题展览会。这是一种规模宏大，易于收效的宣传方式。旅大市经过筹备，在一月二十八日正式开始展览。计分四室：（一）揭露封建婚姻制度的罪恶；（二）说明新民主主义婚姻的政策；（三）新的婚姻关系和苏联社会主义婚姻关系介绍；
    （四）幻灯。并附设“婚姻问题解答处”，专门解答观众有关婚姻问题的疑难问题。展览会受到广大群众的热烈欢迎，他们纷纷要求把这些展览材料拿到农村中去作流动展览。展览会准备附设审判室，结合宣传展览配合有关部门就地处理临时控告的婚姻案件。
    六、在墙壁上大字正楷书写婚姻法全文。识字的一看就懂，不识字的听人念了也就懂了。华北区第一次县长会议关于县人民政府当前十项工作决议中的第八项就明文规定了这个办法。这是完全正确的。除华北各地应全力实现外，其他各地也可以仿效。
    七、宣传婚姻法应该当作经常工作。应该利用各种场合（如冬学，夜校，识字班，训练班等），采取各种方式（如婚姻法图片展览会，读报小组讨论会）进行宣传。并注意用生动的事例，具体说明执行婚姻法对本人对家庭对社会的好处。另外，还应该通过文艺形式，彻底揭露封建伦理观念及侮辱妇女、歧视妇女的封建残余思想，树立新的道德伦理观念。并让广大群众知道婚姻法是中国人民革命的胜利果实之一，是一项重要法律。
    我们必须把虐待妇女或干涉婚姻自由的封建残余思想在群众面前进行无情的揭发和严厉的批判，在干部和群众中进行耐心的宣传教育工作，把婚姻法贯彻到底。
