    Self-criticism of Bureaucratic Work Style by Leading Cadres of Zhonghua Brick Factory
    Editor: The People's Daily published readers' criticisms of the bureaucratic work style of our factory's leading cadres on January 23rd. This criticism is correct. We sincerely thank the critics.
    Our factory started building a rotary kiln in August last year. We did not make thorough plans beforehand, blindly believing in the experience of the foreman Zhao Zideng in kiln building, and we started construction blindly without the approval of the Construction Bureau. During construction, we did not supervise it ourselves, nor did we assign specific supervisors, resulting in the collapse of the chimney when it was built to a height of more than ten zhang, which also smashed two kiln doors. This caused a direct loss of more than 86 million yuan. As for the losses caused by the delay in production due to the failure to complete the project on schedule, it was even greater. When building the horseshoe kiln, we only relied on our own "experience" and did not accept the opinions of the workers. Several brick firings were unsuccessful, which caused another loss of more than 20 million yuan to the state. All this proves that our bureaucratic work style is serious. The same is true in terms of dismissing workers. In December last year, we did not consider the needs of production and the opinions of the workers, and arbitrarily dismissed sixteen workers. As a result of misjudgment, we had to bring back the sixteen workers; this wasted travel expenses and created a bad influence among the workers.
    Our factory is currently carrying out a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. We will further examine the influence of our bureaucratic work style and bourgeois ideology in the movement, and we are willing to correct our mistakes in future work.
    Manager of Zhonghua Brick Factory: Sun Wenxiang
    Deputy Manager: Guo Jianbang
    Editor's Note: This self-criticism is extremely superficial. The mistakes of the leading cadres of Zhonghua Brick Factory are serious. The higher-level leading organs of the factory should conduct a serious examination and deal with the matter.

### 中华制砖厂领导干部对官僚主义作风的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中华制砖厂领导干部对官僚主义作风的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报一月二十三日发表了读者对我厂领导干部官僚主义作风的批评，这个批评是正确的。我们向批评者致诚恳的谢意。
    我厂在去年八月开始打转盘窑。事前我们没有作周密计划，盲目相信把头赵子登打窑的经验，也没有经过建设局批准就盲目施工了。修建时，我们不亲自监督，也不派一定的监工人员，致烟筒在砌到十几丈高时倒塌下来，还砸坏了两个窑门。这次直接损失了八千六百多万元。至于因不能按期完工而耽误生产的损失则更大。打修马蹄窑时，我们只依靠自己的“经验”，不接受工人的意见，几次烧砖都没有烧好，又给国家损失了二千多万元。这些都可以证明我们的官僚主义作风是严重的。在解雇工人方面也是如此。去年十二月，我们没有考虑到生产上的需要和工人的意见，武断地解雇了十六个工人。结果因估计错误，我们把十六个工人又找回来；这既浪费了路费，又在工人中造成了恶劣的影响。
    我厂现正进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，我们将在运动中更进一步检查我们的官僚主义作风和资产阶级思想的影响，并愿今后在工作中改正错误。
    中华制砖厂经理  孙文祥
    副经理  郭建帮
    编者按：这个检讨是极不深刻的。中华制砖厂领导干部的错误是严重的。该厂的上级领导机关应作认真检查和处理。
