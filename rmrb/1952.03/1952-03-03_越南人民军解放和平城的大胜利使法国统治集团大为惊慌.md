Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The victory of the Vietnam People's Army in liberating Hoa Binh City, the capital of Hoa Binh Province, southwest of Hanoi, has greatly alarmed the French ruling clique. According to a United Press Saigon dispatch: French invading army acting commander-in-chief Salan had to admit that the failure in Hoa Binh City was the biggest defeat suffered by the French invading army since being driven out of Cao Bang and Lang Son in the autumn of 1950. Another United Press Paris dispatch on February 26 revealed that the French ruling clique was extremely alarmed that the Vietnam People's Army could "deploy as many as 30,000 to 40,000 well-organized troops in one battle." "French officials also expressed extreme concern" about the possibility of the Vietnam People's Army cutting off the French invading army's defense lines with a large encirclement. Facing the increasingly strong Vietnam People's Army, the so-called "well-informed sources" in Paris quoted by United Press pessimistically predicted that France may have to give up all occupied areas in northern Vietnam this year. Currently, the French invaders, at the end of their rope, have pinned their only hope of saving their defeat in Vietnam on their American masters being able to give them more "aid." French Minister for Relations with Associated States of Indochina Letourneau hurriedly discussed "military and economic assistance issues" with U.S. Minister to Indochina Heath, U.S. Military Mission Chief Brink, and U.S. Economic Mission Chief Dubreuil in Saigon on February 22 (Reuters), and "studied in detail the problems that the French army must encounter in the fight against the Viet Minh" (Agence France-Presse).

    越南人民军解放和平城的大胜利使法国统治集团大为惊慌
    【新华社二日讯】越南人民军解放河内西南的和平省省会和平城的胜利，使法国统治集团十分惊慌。据合众社西贡消息透露：法国侵越军代理总司令萨兰不得不承认：这次在和平城的失败，是法国侵略军从一九五○年秋季被赶出高平、谅山以后所遭受的最大的一次失败。另据合众社巴黎二月二十六日电透露，法国统治集团对越南人民军已能“在一次战斗中投入多达三万到四万名组织良好的军队”极为惊慌。对于越南人民军以大包围之势，割裂法国侵略军防线的可能性，“法国官员也极表忧虑”。面对着愈战愈强的越南人民军，合众社所引巴黎的所谓“消息灵通人士”悲观地预言：法国可能不得不在今年内放弃在越南北部的所有侵占地区。目前，穷途末路的法国侵略者已把它们挽救在越南败局的唯一希望，寄托在美国主子能够给予他们更多的“援助”上。法国印度支那联邦成员国关系部部长勒都尔诺，曾慌忙地于二月二十二日在西贡和美国驻印度支那公使海斯、美国军事使团团长白林克、美国经济使团团长杜布勒等讨论“军事和经济援助问题”（路透社），并且“详细研究了法国军队对付越盟的斗争中必须遇到的问题”（法新社）。
