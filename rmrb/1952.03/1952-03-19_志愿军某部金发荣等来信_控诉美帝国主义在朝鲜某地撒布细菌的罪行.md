    Letter from Jin Farong and others of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, accusing US imperialism of spreading bacteria in a certain area of Korea.
    Editor: Around our garrison, a large number of germ-carrying insects spread by US aggressor planes have been discovered. After being sent to the health department for testing, it has been proven that they carry a large number of bacteria such as plague and typhoid. We want to accuse the United States imperialists before the people of our motherland and all peace-loving people around the world. The frantic US imperialists are attempting to slaughter a large number of peaceful Korean residents and Chinese and Korean people's forces by using this inhuman and despicable trick, which proves that they are willing to be enemies of all mankind. However, the enemy's atrocities can only arouse the anger and determination of all our commanders and fighters to more bravely annihilate the US aggressor forces. We believe that with the strong support of the people of the motherland, especially the medical and health workers of the motherland, we will certainly be able to defeat this despicable conspiracy of US imperialism.
    Jin Farong, Jiang Zhenwu, Lou He, Liu Yiming, Li Guiming, of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

    志愿军某部金发荣等来信
    控诉美帝国主义在朝鲜某地撒布细菌的罪行
    编辑同志：我们是志愿军某部的工作人员。在我们驻地的四周，已经发现了美国侵略者用飞机撒布下来的大量带菌毒虫。经我们送往卫生部门化验，证明它们带有大量鼠疫、伤寒等细菌。我们要向祖国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民控诉。丧心病狂的美帝国主义者用这种灭绝人性的卑鄙无耻的伎俩，企图大量屠杀朝鲜和平居民和中朝人民部队，这证明了它是甘心与全人类为敌的。但是，敌人的暴行只能激起我们全体指战员更加英勇歼灭美国侵略军的愤怒和决心。我们相信，在祖国人民尤其是祖国的医药卫生工作者的大力支援下，一定能击败美帝国主义这一卑鄙无耻的阴谋。
