    The Gramophone Industry Should Not Play Obsolete and Harmful Records
    To the Editor: Every time I go to the Dongsi People's Market in Beijing, I hear the gramophone department playing obsolete and harmful records such as "When Will You Return?", "Four Seasons of Longing," and "The Wind of May" to attract customers. I think it is very inappropriate to play these records that spread bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological poisons in the People's Market. I suggest that the gramophone industry in the People's Market should no longer use these poisonous records to test gramophones in the market.

    唱机业不要放送陈腐有害的唱片
    编辑同志：我每次到北京东四人民市场去，都听到唱机业部里，放送“何日君再来”“四季相思”
    “五月的风”等陈腐有害的唱片，以此来吸引主顾。我觉得在人民市场放送这些散布资产阶级和小资产阶级思想毒素的唱片，是很不妥当的。我建议人民市场的唱机业，不要再用这些有毒素的唱片在市场上试验唱机。
