    Leaders of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Company Should Investigate Zhang Aimin's Crimes
    Editor: Zhang Aimin, the person in charge of the 5102 construction site of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Company, has been wasting and stealing state property in large quantities during the construction of a certain sanatorium. Zhang did not pay attention to the storage of materials, and more than 300 bags of cement were damaged due to moisture or rain. He ordered the workers to smash the damaged cement and then mix it into the project. When mixing the cement, Zhang stole six jin of cement from every two bags. He mixed two hundred bags a day, so Zhang stole six hundred jin of cement. In two months, Zhang stole 360 bags of cement, worth 93.6 million yuan. After the building was completed, part of the foundation had bulged, the columns had cracks, and the beams were skewed. I request the leaders of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Company to thoroughly investigate Zhang Aimin's crimes.

    北京市建筑工程公司领导方面应检查张爱民的罪行
    编辑同志：北京市建筑工程公司五一○二工地负责人张爱民，在修建某疗养院的工程中，大量地浪费和盗窃国家财产。张不重视保管材料，有三百多袋洋灰受了潮或因着雨不好用了。他叫工人砸碎这些坏了的洋灰，然后掺用到工程里去。搅拌洋灰时，张在每两袋洋灰中偷洋灰六斤。每天打二百袋，张就偷六百斤洋灰。两个月里，张偷洋灰三百六十袋，价值九千三百六十万元。楼房盖好后，部分地基已凸起，楼柱有裂缝，大梁都歪了。我要求北京市建筑工程公司领导方面彻查张爱民的罪行。
