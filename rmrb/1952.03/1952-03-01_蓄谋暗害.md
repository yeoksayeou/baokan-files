Premeditated Harm

Zhang Zhixiang

The harm done to the Volunteer Army by illegal capitalists, if not premeditated through prior consultation, is at least "sympathetic" and premeditated harm.

They use inferior rubber shoes to hinder the victorious advance of the Volunteer Army; they use inferior anti-skid chains to delay the Volunteer Army's transportation and supply; they use iron shovels that can only dig tofu to prevent the Volunteer Army from successfully building fortifications, increasing casualties; they use sand mixed with fried wheat and rotten meat in cans to harm the health of the Volunteer Army; and after the Volunteer Army comrades are injured, they use fake medicines, fake serums, and rotten cotton to create unnecessary disabilities and sacrifices.

The Chinese people contribute millions of excellent sons and daughters to the great cause of peace, but these demons are staring intently at our most beloved people, using malicious murder on the road of the heroes' victorious advance to seek ways to make money.

Although illegal capitalists are in various industries, some are in Shanghai, some are in Wuhan, some are in Guangzhou, some are in Tianjin... they all shoot arrows at the Volunteer Army without prior agreement. There is no other reason for this, because they are of the same family, the same lineage, and the same "tiger" surname; harming heaven and reason, and only seeking profit, is a family tradition.

From the perspective of the bourgeoisie's profit-seeking class nature, and from their widespread and massive smuggling and tax evasion, theft of state property, corruption of state personnel, cutting corners... criminal facts, it can be concluded that among merchants and capitalists, there are more lawbreakers than law-abiding people. They are frantically launching attacks on the country with a tacit understanding, and the premeditated harm they are inflicting on the Volunteer Army is the most typical part of their frantic attack. Anyone can see it unless they are blind; they are spreading a decadent and rotten atmosphere to society in a competitive manner, and anyone can smell it unless they have a cold and a blocked nose. If someone thinks this statement is too general and insists on dividing capitalists into half a catty or eight taels, and wants to admit that "there are also enlightened people in the bourgeoisie," that is permissible. But it is first necessary to admit that this pursuit of profit is the class attribute of the bourgeoisie, and then analyze the degree of illegality, some harming heaven and reason, some harming reason but not to the extent of harming heaven, etc., is reasonable.

    蓄谋暗害
    张致祥
    不法资本家们对于志愿军的暗害，假如不是彼此事先商量好的，至少也是“心心相印”的、蓄谋的暗害。
    他们用劣质的胶鞋，来阻碍志愿军的胜利进军；他们用劣质的防滑练，来迟滞志愿军的运输供应；他们用只能挖豆腐的铁锨，使志愿军不能顺利构筑工事，增加伤亡；他们用沙子掺炒麦，臭肉装罐头，来危害志愿军的健康；而在志愿军同志伤病之后，又用假药、假血清、烂药棉，来制造不应有的残废和牺牲。
    中国人民以千千万万的优秀儿女，贡献于伟大的和平事业，但这些恶魔们却死死地盯住我们最可爱的人，在英雄们胜利前进的道路上，用恶毒的谋杀，来寻找生财之道。
    不法资本家们虽然分做各行各业，他们有的在上海，有的在武汉，有的在广州，有的在天津……但他们却不约而同，向志愿军放射暗箭。此无他，因为他们是同宗同谱同姓“虎”；伤天害理，唯利是图，是出自家传的。
    从资产阶级的唯利是图的阶级属性来看，从他们普遍的大量的走私漏税、盗窃国家资财、腐蚀国家工作人员、偷工减料……罪恶事实来看，可以得出结论，商人、资本家，不法者多，守法者少。他们心心相印地向国家进行着猖狂的进攻，向志愿军所进行的蓄谋暗害，即是他们猖狂进攻中最典型的一部分，只要不是瞎子，是谁都可以看到的；他们竞赛似地向社会散布着腐朽霉烂的风气，只要不是感冒鼻子不通，是谁都可以闻到的。假如有人认为这种说法失之于笼统，一定要把资本家分个半斤八两，要承认“资产阶级中也不乏明哲之士”，那倒是可以允许的。但是必须首先承认这个唯利是图是资产阶级的阶级属性，然后再去分析不法程度有轻重，有的伤天害理，有的害理而不到伤天等等，才是合理的。
