    A Major Reform in the Machine Industry
    ——Introducing the Multi-Tool, Multi-Edge Cutting Method

    Last winter, workers in the machine manufacturing industry of Shenyang City, in the process of promoting the high-speed cutting method, pooled their collective wisdom and created and enriched the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method. The birth of the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method is a major reform in machine industry technology in our country. In our country, hexagonal lathes, automatic lathes, and multi-spindle lathes are still rare. Therefore, machine tools cannot be professionally produced. Inspired by a high degree of patriotism, workers in the machine manufacturing industry of Shenyang City have brought into play their collective wisdom and created a multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method that can be used on any machine tool, making it possible to generally improve labor efficiency throughout the mechanical industry. The multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method has already demonstrated its significant economic role. By mid-January of this year, more than 600 workers in 17 state-owned factories in Shenyang City had implemented this advanced cutting method on 270 types of parts, generally increasing production efficiency by one time. Several factories combined this cutting method with the high-speed cutting method, increasing production efficiency by 18 and a half times. Mechanical Factory No. 1, under the Northeast Mechanical Industry Administration Bureau, reduced costs by 26% in November of last year compared to October due to the promotion of high-speed cutting and the implementation of the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method. In October and November of last year, Workshop No. 5 of Mechanical Factory No. 9, with only 35% of its machine tools implementing the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method and high-speed cutting method, increased national grain production by 170 tons. Since September of last year, the processing workshop of Mechanical Factory No. 6 has not only implemented high-speed cutting and rapid cutting on all machine tools, but also implemented the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method, with production efficiency averaging four times higher than in August of last year. In the second half of last year, the processing workshop increased its total production by an amount equivalent to 10,450 tons of grain, exceeding the original increased production plan by 13 and a half times. It is estimated that if this advanced cutting method is promoted and applied in combination with the high-speed cutting method in all machine industries, it can increase production efficiency by five to ten times or more. The multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method not only improves production efficiency, but also improves the technical level of skilled workers and technicians, preparing better technical conditions for further mastering and using more complex and modern machine tools (such as hexagonal lathes, automatic and semi-automatic machine tools, multi-spindle and special machine tools, etc.). Therefore, the emergence and promotion of the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method has created favorable conditions for China's industrial development both economically and technically.

    The multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method involves installing several tools on a machine tool to cut simultaneously, or grinding several cutting edges on one tool to replace the role of several tools. In the past, the machine processing lathes used in general factories were all single-tool. When cutting a complex product, it was often necessary to change several tools and turn the tool holder several times. The cutting and auxiliary production time was too long, and the workers' physical exertion was very high, so the efficiency of the lathe could not be brought into play more effectively. The multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method can avoid these shortcomings. Its advantages are: 1. Reducing cutting and auxiliary production time, and highly exploiting the cutting efficiency of the lathe. In the past, the Shenyang Farm Tool Factory had to turn the tool holder 2,300 times to make a sprayer switch, wasting fully half of the production time. After using this cutting method, the tool holder does not need to be turned even once, and the time for measuring the product can also be saved. 2. Simplifying production processes so that young workers can quickly master cutting technology. Because the use of the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method reduces cutting and auxiliary operations, such as retracting the tool, changing the tool, turning the tool holder, measuring the product, etc., the experienced technicians can install the tools, and the young workers can operate continuously when manufacturing a product. Three months ago, all lathes in the processing workshop of Mechanical Factory No. 6 were directly operated by skilled workers, and apprentices could only stand by and pour oil; because the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method simplifies the operation process and is easy to learn, half of the apprentices in the entire workshop have learned this advanced cutting technology, and now nearly half of the machine tools are used by apprentices to cut complex parts. Wang Shuhong, an apprentice of the third-grade lathe operator Gao Guangzhen, the originator of the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method, has been able to replace Gao Guangzhen's work. All the lathes in the processing workshop of Machine Factory No. 6 can soon be handed over to young workers, and each group only needs to retain one experienced technician; the remaining experienced technicians can be transferred to more important positions. 3. Improving quality. In the past, when farm tool factory lathe operators manufactured a precision product, defective products were often produced; after using the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method, template-style tools were used, which ensured the specifications of the products. The scrap rate in the lathe workshop of their factory was reduced by 21.3%.

    The multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method was extracted from a mass campaign to "find tricks". Its creation and enrichment process powerfully shattered conservative thinking on technology. After the working class in Northeast China responded to Comrade Gao Gang's call for increasing production and practicing economy, they launched the "find tricks" campaign. In September, Guo Rujiu, the party branch secretary of the processing workshop of Mechanical Factory No. 6, on the one hand, explained the political significance of increasing production and practicing economy to the workers, and on the other hand, encouraged and inspired the workers to find tricks to improve technology. Gao Guangzhen, a third-grade lathe operator, felt that cutting with a single tool, turning the tool holder, and changing the tool head were too many procedures and took too long. One day, when he was manufacturing an aluminum "screw tube," he said to Guo Rujiu: "I want to use two tools to cut threads at the same time, but I'm afraid the machine won't be able to handle it!" Guo Rujiu said: "Okay, just do it! I'll be responsible if the machine breaks down." The result of the experiment was that not only could the machine withstand it, but also the output on that day increased by 70%, and the next day it increased to one and a half times. The factory immediately sent a technician to summarize Gao Guangzhen's experience and affirmed this "multi-tool" method. In a few days, Di Defeng and Li Huashun found another "multi-edge" trick.

    In October, the entire workshop tried the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method, increasing production by more than one time. After the news spread to the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Machine Manufacturing Workers' Union (hereinafter referred to as the Municipal Committee), many cadres from old technical worker backgrounds believed that this was a good method and immediately organized workers from other factories to visit Mechanical Factory No. 6. However, the visitors had different opinions. Some people said: "The method is good, but we can't learn it. Don't think it's like cutting radishes when you see this aluminum part being cut so quickly. If you replace it with our steel parts, I guarantee it won't move at all!" Some people took the fixture to test the outer circle of the part cut by Li Huashun and said: "It's only suitable for this kind of rough work, not for precision work!" Therefore, the cadres of the Municipal Committee said to Xu Pingda, a worker at the Farm Tool Factory: "Can you try doing copper work at your farm tool factory?" Xu Pingda said: "We can try." After Xu Pingda returned, he and Sun Yuhai jointly studied and combined three tools to work together that previously took eight or nine cuts to make three steps, three planes, one inner eye, and two threads. Each tool was ground with two cutting edges, and after one cut, all three steps and three planes were made; then two tools were installed at a fixed distance. After one cut, one inner eye and two threads were cut. Production efficiency was shortened from more than ten minutes per piece to one and a half minutes per piece. More importantly, after the first piece is aligned, there is no need to measure the subsequent pieces with templates and micrometers to ensure quality. This time, the cadres of the Municipal Committee had even greater confidence and held an expanded production meeting. Xu Pingda made a typical report at the meeting. However, a small number of workers still believed that "it won't work for steel work." The Municipal Committee then separately mobilized Li Wenzhong's Fifth Lathe Group of the Third Factory of Machinery and Tong Shulin, the production committee member of the trade union of the Ninth Factory of Machinery, hoping that they could make examples of these two steel parts, one large and one small and precise. Li Wenzhong of the Third Factory's Fifth Lathe Group successfully turned the most precise gear synchronizer. Song Jinyin of Machinery Factory No. 9 also successfully turned a very small "adjusting screw." At the same time, the Scientific Instrument Factory used two tools on a milling machine to cut shims; Liu Hansheng of Machinery Factory No. 2 used multi-tool cutting on a boring machine; and Wang Xuegen of Machinery Factory No. 1 used multi-tool cutting on a gantry planer, all of which were successful. At this point, conservative thinking was completely shattered and doubts were dispelled. Facts have proved that the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method can not only cut light metal products, but also heavy metal products; it can not only cut ordinary rough products, but also precision products with a tolerance of 0.05 mm; it can be used not only on automatic electric motor lathes, but also on old-fashioned belt lathes; and it can be used on various machine tools such as slotting machines, milling machines, and planers.

    The multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method can be promoted in all machine factories. The Mechanical Industry Administration Bureau of the Northeast People's Government's Industry Department and the Northeast Regional Committee of the Chinese Machine Manufacturing Workers' Union jointly convened a conference on the promotion of high-speed cutting and multi-tool, multi-edge cutting methods on December 25th of last year. It requires subordinate units to earnestly promote the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method and launch a technological innovation campaign in the machine industry sector. The widespread promotion of this advanced cutting method will promote all machine processing departments to rationally reform labor organization, technical operating procedures, and the use of various tools; machine manufacturing departments will also change the design of various lathes. The combined use of the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method and the high-speed cutting method can exert greater efficiency; at the same time, promoting these two advanced cutting methods will surely bring a new look and broad development prospects to China's machine industry.

    机器工业上的一个重大改革
    ——介绍多刀多刃切削法
    沈阳市机器制造业工人去年冬天在推广高速切削法的过程中，集中群众智慧，创造并丰富了多刀多刃切削法。多刀多刃切削法的诞生，是我国机器工业技术上的一个重大改革。在我国，六角车床、自动车床、多轴车床的设备，目前还是很少的。因而机床不能专业生产。沈阳市机器制造业工人在高度的爱国热情鼓舞下，发挥了集体智慧，创造了在任何机床上都可运用的多刀多刃切削法，使整个机械工业普遍提高劳动效率有了可能。多刀多刃切削法已显示了它在经济上的重大作用。到今年一月中旬止，沈阳市已有十七个国营工厂的六百多名工人，在二百七十种部件上实行了这一先进切削法，生产效率一般地提高了一倍。若干工厂把这一切削法和高速切削法结合运用，使生产效率提高了十八倍半。东北机械工业管理局所属机械一厂，去年十一月份，由于推广高速切削法和实施多刀多刃切削法，成本比十月份降低百分之二十六。机械九厂第五车间于去年十月、十一月，仅有百分之三十五的机床实行多刀多刃切削法和高速切削法，就给国家增产一百七十吨粮食。机械六厂加工车间从去年九月到现在，除已在全部机床上实行高速切削、快速切削外，并实行了多刀多刃切削法，生产效率平均比去年八月份提高了四倍。加工车间在去年下半年，共增产等于一万零四百五十吨粮食的财富，超过原增产计划十三倍半。预计这一先进切削法如在所有机器工业中和高速切削法结合推广运用，可以使生产效率提高五倍到十倍以上。多刀多刃切削法不仅提高了生产效率，并且提高了技术工人、技术人员的技术水平，为进一步掌握和使用更复杂更近代化的机床（如六角车床、自动和半自动机床、多轴和专门机床等），准备了更好的技术条件。因此，多刀多刃切削法的出现和推广，在经济上，在技术上，都为我国工业发展创造了有利的条件。
    多刀多刃切削法，就是在机床上安装几把刀同时切削，或在一把刀上磨出几个刃口，代替几把刀的作用。在过去，一般工厂中所使用的机器加工车床都是单刀，切削一种规格复杂的产品时，常常要换几把刀，转几次刀架子，切削和辅助生产时间太多，工人体力消耗很大，所以车床效能不能更高地发挥。多刀多刃切削法可以避免这些缺点。它的好处是：一、减少切削和辅助生产的时间，高度发挥车床的切削效能。沈阳农具工厂过去做一个喷雾器开关，要转两千三百次刀架子，整整费去一半的生产时间。运用这种切削法后，刀架子一次也不用转，还可以节省测量产品的时间。二、简化生产工序，使青年工人也能迅速地掌握切削技术。因为运用多刀多刃切削法后，减少了切削和辅助性质的操作手续，如退刀、换刀、转刀架子、测量产品等等，所以制造一种产品时，老技术工人把刀装好，青年工人就能连续操作。机械六厂加工车间，三个月以前，全部车床都由技术工人直接操作，徒工只能站在旁边浇油；由于多刀多刃切削法简化了操作工序，容易学习，全车间半数徒工已学会了这一先进的切削技术，现已有将近一半的机床由徒工掌握切削复杂的部件。多刀多刃切削法的首创人三级车工高光珍带的徒工王树洪，已经能代替高光珍的工作。机器六厂加工车间全部车床很快就可以交给青年工人掌握，每组只须留一个老技术工人；其余的老技术工人可以抽调到更重要的岗位上去。三、提高质量。农具一厂车工过去制造一种精密产品时，经常出废品；使用多刀多刃切削法后，都利用了样板式的刀具，使产品的规格得到了保证。他们厂里车工车间的废品率就因此降低了百分之二十一点三。
    多刀多刃切削法，是从群众性的找窍门运动中提炼出来的。它的创造和丰富过程，有力地击破了技术上的保守思想。东北工人阶级响应高岗同志的增产节约号召以后，展开了“找窍门”运动。九月间，机械六厂加工车间的党支部书记郭如九，一方面向工人讲增产节约的政治意义，另一方面鼓励和启发工人找窍门，提高技术。三级车工高光珍觉得用单刀切削，转刀架，换刀头，手续多，时间长。有一天，他制造铝质“螺筒”时，对郭如九说：“我想用两把刀一齐排丝扣，就是怕床子呛不住！”郭如九说：“行，你就这样干吧！床子出毛病我负责。”试验的结果，不仅机床能顶得住，并且当天的产量就提高了百分之七十，第二天又提高到一倍半。厂部马上派个技术员去总结高光珍的经验，肯定了这个“多刀”的办法。不多几天，邸德丰、李华顺又找出一个“多刃”的窍门。
    十月间，全车间试用多刀多刃切削法，增加产量一倍以上。这个消息传到中国机器制造业工会沈阳市委员会（以下简称市委员会）以后，许多老技术工人出身的干部认为这是个好办法，立即组织别的工厂工人到机器六厂去参观。可是参观的人却有不同的看法。有人说：“办法是好，就是我们没法学。你别看车这个铝件像削大萝卜似的飞快，若是换上我们的钢件，保证一动也不动！”有人拿胎具试试李华顺车下部件的外圆，说：“只配干这路粗活，干精密活可不行！”于是市委员会的干部，对农具工厂工人许平达说：“你们农具厂干铜活能不能试试？”许平达说：“可以试试看。”许平达回去后，就和孙玉海共同研究，把以前一个得吃八九回刀，车三个台，三个平面，一个里眼，排两个丝扣的这样一个复杂活，用三把刀并在一起，每把刀磨两个刃，进一回刀，三个台三个面全出来了；又在固定的距离上安好两把刀，切削一次，就把一个里眼、两个丝扣削好了。生产效率由十几分钟车一个缩短到一分半钟车一个。更重要的是把第一个活对准后，以后的活就不用样板和千分尺来量，一样保证质量。这一回市委员会的干部信心更高了，又召开了扩大生产会议。许平达在会上做了典型报告。可是仍然有一小部分工人认为“干钢活不行”。市委员会就又分别动员机器三厂三车间的车工五组和机器九厂的工会生产委员佟树林，希望在他们这两个有大有小而又精密的钢件上能够做出范例来。三厂车工五组李文忠车最精密的齿轮咬合器成功了。机器九厂宋金印车很小的“调节螺丝”也成功了。同时，科学仪器厂在铣床上用两把刀切垫铁；机器二厂刘汉生在镗旋上用多刀切削；机器一厂王学根在龙门刨上用多刀切削，都成功了。到这时，保守思想被完全击破了，怀疑消除了。事实证明：用多刀多刃切削法，不仅可以切削轻金属制品，还可以切削重金属制品；不仅能切削普通粗制品，还能切削公差零点五粍的精密制品；不仅在自动电机转动车床上可以运用，在旧式皮带车床上也可以运用；并且在插床、铣床、刨床等各种机床上都可以运用。
    多刀多刃切削法是可以在所有的机器工厂中推广的。东北人民政府工业部机械工业管理局和中国机器制造业工会东北区委员会已于去年十二月二十五日联合召开了高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法推广大会。要求所属单位认真推广多刀多刃切削法，在机器工业部门开展一个技术革新运动。这一先进切削法的普遍推广，将促使所有机器加工部门合理地改革劳动组织、技术操作规程和各种工具的使用；机器制造部门也将改变各种车床的设计。多刀多刃切削法和高速切削法结合运用，就能发挥更大的效率；同时推广这两种先进的切削方法，必将给我国机器工业带来一幅新的面貌和广阔发展的前途。
