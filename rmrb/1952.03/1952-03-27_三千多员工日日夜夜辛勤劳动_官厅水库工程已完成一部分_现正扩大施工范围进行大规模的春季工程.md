The massive Guanting Reservoir project, through the diligent day and night labor of over three thousand employees, has been partially completed. Now, the construction scope is being expanded in an effort to start impounding floodwaters by next summer.

Since the completion of most of the preparatory work in early October last year, this project has entered a tense phase of preparation and construction simultaneously in mid-October. The first phase of the project mainly involved excavating a drainage tunnel and a spillway in the mountains, as well as constructing transportation lines and installing machinery and lighting equipment for the construction site. By March 10th of this year, after five months, the water conveyance tunnel project had reached 29.1 percent completion. The transportation line project, including highways and earth/sand/stone railways, had reached 27 percent completion. In order to supply the construction site with materials and facilitate transportation across the Yongding River, seven small bridges and one large Yongding River bridge were also completed. The mountain gully drainage project has reached 18 percent completion. The spillway project was originally planned to be constructed during this year's flood season, but in order to find work for some surplus labor, 12,900+ workdays were allocated for excavation in November last year, and it is now 2.4 percent complete. It is still necessary to excavate 79,720+ cubic meters of stone in order to complete the water conveyance tunnel and various preparatory projects on schedule before the flood season. To this end, the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau and the Chanan Special District have decided to mobilize more than 3,300 laborers from Huailai and four other counties to carry out a large-scale spring construction project.

This year's plan for the Guanting Reservoir project is to complete over 800,000 cubic meters of earthwork, over 270,000 cubic meters of stonework, 28,700 cubic meters of concrete work, 5,365 square meters of housing, and 15,000 square meters of temporary sheds, requiring a total of approximately 2 million workdays of various types. The number of laborers on the construction site will gradually increase to 12,600 by October this year. The main construction materials needed this year, such as steel, iron, cement, and fuel, are being transported to the construction site from Beijing, Tianjin, Northeast China, and Inner Mongolia.

Immediately after the start of construction, due to inadequate planning, material preparation and construction were carried out simultaneously. Coupled with the heavy workload, the cold weather, and short days, there was a short period of chaos after the start of construction, resulting in some waste of manpower and materials. Some leading cadres were not good at using the mass line working method, and some engineers had a strong purely technical viewpoint, neglecting the education of the laborers and the proper arrangement of their lives. As a result, many laborers were uneasy when they came to work on the construction site, which affected the project. In December last year, Minister of Water Resources Fu Zuoyi, Vice Minister Li Baohua, and Director of the North China Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau Cheng Run came to the construction site to inspect and pointed out and criticized the above shortcomings. After that, the leadership and the engineering personnel of the whole bureau clearly recognized the necessity of strengthening planning, organization, and reliance on the broad masses of workers. First, political leadership was strengthened, and political work groups were established in each construction site. On the one hand, they solved the practical problems of the laborers, and on the other hand, they vigorously carried out patriotic and collectivist education among the laborers. At the same time, the work methods of Ma Wanshui (Ma Wanshui was a worker at the Longyan Iron Mine and a famous labor model; his work method was assembly line operation) were promoted in various tunnels and workshops, and democratic management committees were generally established. On the basis of promoting democracy, engineering plans were formulated and implemented. After this fundamental problem was initially resolved, a new situation immediately appeared in the project. The laborers successively signed patriotic pledges and launched a vigorous labor emulation campaign, giving full play to their enthusiasm and creativity. In the cold weather, the laborers built bridges and dug soil in water at minus two degrees Celsius, and quarried stone halfway up mountains more than ten meters high. In order to complete the task ahead of schedule, the laborers also voluntarily proposed to work overtime; the power plant workers also worked twelve hours a day to ensure nighttime lighting. A part of the laborers engaged in the transportation line project increased the average daily excavation from more than three cubic meters of soil to seven cubic meters. Since the launch of the competition between the Li Yuming and Zhang Xu groups in the water conveyance tunnel, the number of stone ballast trucks pushed per day has increased from sixty to one hundred and twenty, doubling the work efficiency. Each democratic management branch convened "Zhuge Liang meetings" to find solutions, resulting in many innovations. After careful study, the Li Tingzuo and Dong Xiang groups created the "two vertical and one horizontal" (drilling two holes in the plane and one hole on the side) and "planting dots and beans" (drilling holes in rows on the slope of the rocky mountain, with the holes in each row staggered like planting dots and beans) stone cutting methods, which increased work efficiency by 30 percent.

    三千多员工日日夜夜辛勤劳动
    官厅水库工程已完成一部分
    现正扩大施工范围进行大规模的春季工程
    巨大的官厅水库工程，经过三千多员工辛勤的日夜劳动，已完成了一部分；现在正扩大施工范围，争取明年夏天开始拦蓄洪水。
    这个工程从去年十月初完成大部准备工作以后，十月中旬就进入紧张的一面准备一面施工阶段。第一阶段的工程，主要是在大山上开凿一道泄水的隧洞，一条溢洪道，和修筑交通线，安装机器、设置电灯等工地设备。到今年三月十日，经过五个月的时间，输水道工程已完成百分之二十九点一。交通线工程包括公路和土砂石便线，已完成百分之二十七。为了供应工地器材和沟通永定河东西两岸的交通运输，还完成了七座小桥和一座永定河大桥。山沟排水工程，已完成百分之十八。溢洪道工程按计划本来是在今年汛期施工，为给一部分剩余劳动力找活作，去年十一月，就抽出一万二千九百多个工日进行挖凿，现已完成百分之二点四。还需凿石七万九千七百二十多立方公尺，才能在汛期以前把输水道和各项准备工程按期完工。为此，官厅水库工程局和察南专署决定从怀来等五县动员三千三百多民工，开展大规模的春季工程建设。
    兴修官厅水库的工程今年计划要完成土工八十多万公方、石工二十七万多公方、混凝土工二万八千七百公方、房屋五千三百六十五平方公尺和临时工棚一万五千平方公尺，共需各种人工约二百万个，工地上的民工，今年十月份将要逐渐增加到一万二千六百人。今年需用的钢、铁、洋灰、油料等主要工料正从北京、天津、东北、内蒙等地源源向工地赶运。
    刚一开工，由于计划不周，备料和施工同时进行，再加上任务繁重，天寒日短，开工后曾有一个短期的混乱，使人力物力遭到一些浪费。某些领导干部不善于运用群众路线的工作方法，部分工程师有浓厚的单纯技术观点，忽略了对民工的教育和对民工生活的妥善安排，因此，不少民工来到工地作工时不安心，使工程受到影响。去年十二月中央人民政府水利部傅作义部长、李葆华副部长和华北水利工程总局成润局长到工地检查，指出并批判了以上缺点以后，领导方面和全局工程人员明确认识了加强计划性组织性和依靠广大职工群众的必要。首先，加强了政治领导，各施工所都建立了政治工作组，一方面解决民工中的实际问题，一方面在民工中大力进行了爱国主义和集体主义的教育。同时，各洞口和车间也推广了马万水的工作方法（马万水是龙烟铁矿的工人，著名劳动模范；他的工作法就是流水作业法），普遍建立了民主管理委员会，在发扬民主的基础上，制订和贯彻了工程计划。这一根本问题初步解决以后，工程马上出现一个新的局面。民工纷纷订立了爱国公约，发起轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛，发挥了民工劳动积极性和创造性。在天寒地冻的日月，民工在零下二度的流水中，搭桥挖土，在高达十多公尺的半山腰中打石方。为了提前完成任务，民工还自动提出加夜班；发电所工人也曾每天工作十二小时，保证夜间照明。从事交通线工程的一部分民工由每天平均挖三立方公尺多土提高到七立方公尺。输水道的李玉明和张绪两小组开展竞赛以来，由每天推石碴六十车增加到一百二十车，工作效率提高一倍。各民主管理分会都召开了“诸葛亮会”找窍门，因此有很多创造。李廷佐和董祥等小组，经过细心钻研，创造出“二立一卧”（在平面打两眼，在侧面打一眼）和“种地点豆”（在石山斜面上分排打眼，各排的眼互相错开，像种地点豆一样）的打石方法以后，工作效率提高百分之三十。
