    A Cotton High-Yield Model Village
    Zeng Run, Yue Qian
    Chengjiao Village, a suburb of Shijiazhuang City, which was awarded the title of "Cotton High-Yield Model Village" in Hebei Province, achieved an average yield of 380 jin of seed cotton per mu on its 486 mu of cotton fields last year, under the guidance of Liang Jiarui, the Communist Party branch secretary and village head, and the village agricultural technology research group, exceeding the village's high-yield plan of 300 jin of seed cotton per mu.

    Last spring, after the People's Government issued the call for a patriotic high-yield competition, Liang Jiarui led the villagers in enthusiastically responding through the village people's representative conference. All households in the village included "Strive to increase production and strengthen national defense" in their patriotic pledges. In recent years, due to improvements in agricultural technology, the cotton yield per unit area in this village has gradually increased. In 1947, when it was liberated, the yield was less than 100 jin of seed cotton per mu, but by 1950, it had reached an average of 250 jin per mu. Therefore, the villagers had great confidence in carrying out the patriotic high-yield movement. Last spring, when the villagers formulated their patriotic high-yield plan, they unanimously proposed to increase the yield of cotton fields from 250 jin per mu in 1950 to 300 jin per mu.

    In order to achieve this plan, Liang Jiarui first united four Communist Party branch committee members and nine farmers with experience in cotton planting and enthusiasm for researching cotton planting technology to form a technology research group, as the core for guiding cotton planting technology in the village.

    Last June, aphids became widespread in cotton, and the technology group organized farmers to eliminate them. When cotton farmers did not know how to prepare the pesticide, the members of the technology group braved the hot weather to personally teach farmers how to prepare the pesticide, door to door. Liang Jiarui himself went to the fields every day at noon to check on the aphid control situation. If he found anyone who had not controlled them, he would repeatedly mobilize them to do so. In Liang Jiarui's cotton field the year before, using the same fertilizer and the same farming methods, the field where the insects were treated three days earlier yielded 480 jin of cotton per mu, while the field where the insects were treated three days later yielded only 180 jin per mu. He used this fact to educate the farmers and break the cotton farmers' reliance on the weather. When there was a shortage of aphid control pesticides, he and other village cadres went to various places to collectively buy pesticides and distribute them to the cotton farmers for use. Not long after the aphids were eliminated, red spiders appeared. At this time, the farmers were all anxious, and some said, "If the heavens don't allow a harvest, there's no way to get one!" After hearing these reactions, Liang Jiarui and other village cadres explained to the cotton farmers to overcome their complacency, and at the same time, they investigated the damage caused by red spiders, and re-proposed the slogan: "Where pests occur, eliminate them there!" At this time, the technology research group, according to the method of boiling sulfur and lime water taught by the farm, uniformly boiled the pesticide, and distributed the pesticide to the cotton farmers according to the number of mu of affected cotton fields. At the same time, all the labor force in the village was organized to spray the pesticide together. In this way, in less than two days, the red spiders were completely eliminated.

    In order to promote cotton planting technology, Liang Jiarui and the members of the technology research group all specially set aside a small piece of land as a test area for seed selection, fertilization, weeding, pest control, and pruning, to promote technology to the villagers. For example, the cotton in Liang Jiarui's experimental area in the year before yielded 480 jin per mu. He taught the experience to the villagers through the technology research group, so that the average cotton field yielded 380 jin last year. Last year, his experimental cotton field yielded 745 jin per mu, and the technology group taught his experience to the villagers again. The villagers generally said, "Since there has been a technology research group, farming is like a trapped dragon getting water, and less land can still yield more cotton." Last year, the village's cotton fields generally plowed one inch deeper than in the past, tilled three times, weeded six times, and cultivated according to the methods of pruning, fertilizing, and watering guided by the technology group. In this way, the village's cotton fields yielded 380 jin per mu last year, an increase of 130 jin per mu compared to the previous year.

    Last winter, the villagers formulated a plan to increase the cotton yield per unit area this year, and have carefully selected 8,000 jin of cotton seeds, and added draft animals, waterwheels, new farm implements, and sprayers. This year, they are striving to achieve an average yield of 400 jin of seed cotton per mu.

    一个棉花丰产模范村
    曾润  岳千
    荣获河北省“棉花丰产模范村”称号的石家庄市郊区城角庄，在共产党支部书记、村长梁家瑞和村农业技术研究组的指导下，去年全村四百八十六亩棉田，平均每亩产籽棉三百八十斤，超额完成了全村每亩产三百斤籽棉的丰产计划。
    去年春天，人民政府发出爱国丰产竞赛运动号召后，梁家瑞就通过村人民代表会议，领导全村农民热烈响应。全村各户都把“努力增加生产，加强国防力量”订在爱国公约上。几年来，由于农业技术的改进，这个村的棉花单位面积产量逐渐提高。一九四七年解放时，每亩棉田产籽棉不到一百斤，到一九五○年，平均每亩已产到二百五十斤。因此，这个村的农民对开展爱国丰产运动的信心很大。去年春天，全村农民订立爱国丰产计划时，一致提出要争取每亩棉田产量由一九五○年的二百五十斤提高到三百斤。
    为实现这个计划，梁家瑞首先联合四个中共支部委员和九个对植棉有经验又热心研究植棉技术的农民，组成技术研究组，作为指导全村植棉技术的核心。
    去年六月里，棉花普遍发生了蚜虫，技术组就组织农民除治；棉农不会配药，技术组的组员就冒着炎热的天气，挨户亲手教会农民配药。梁家瑞自己每天中午到地里检验治蚜情况，如发现有人没有治，他就三番五次地动员他们除治。梁家瑞前年的棉花地，用同等的肥料和同样的耕作方法，治虫早三天的每亩摘棉四百八十斤，治晚了三天的每亩只摘一百八十斤。他就用这个事实教育农民，打破棉农的靠天吃饭思想。缺乏治蚜药剂时，他和其他村干部就到各地集体买药，分给棉农使用。棉蚜消灭不久，又发生了红蜘蛛，这时农民都着了急，有的人就说：“天不让收，怎么也收不了！”梁家瑞和其他村干部听到这些反映后，就一面向棉农解释，克服麻痹思想，一面调查红蜘蛛为害的情况，重新提出口号：“害虫发生在那里，就把它消灭在那里！”这时技术研究组又按照农场教给的硫磺石灰水的熬制方法，统一熬成药剂，按受害的棉田亩数给棉农配给药水，同时还把村里所有的劳动力组织起来，一齐喷治。这样，不到两天时间，就把红蜘蛛完全消灭了。
    梁家瑞和技术研究组的组员为了推广植棉技术，都特别划出一小块土地，作为选种、施肥、锄草、治虫、整枝打杈的试验区，向全村农民推广技术。例如前年梁家瑞的试验区的棉花，每亩产到四百八十斤，他就通过技术研究组，把经验教给全村农民，使去年的棉田平均产到三百八十斤；去年他的试验棉田每亩产到七百四十五斤，又由技术组把他的经验教给全村农民。这个村的农民普遍都说：“自从有了技术研究组，种庄稼就像困龙得了水，地少也能多摘棉花。”去年这个村的棉田已普遍做到比过去深耕一寸，连耕三遍，锄六遍，并都按照技术组指导的整枝打杈、施肥、浇水等方法进行耕作。这样，去年全村棉田每亩就产到三百八十斤，比前年每亩增产一百三十斤。
    这个村农民去冬已订出今年提高棉花单位面积产量的计划，并已精选棉籽八千斤，并且添买耕畜、水车、新式农具、喷雾器，今年争取每亩棉田平均产籽棉四百斤。
