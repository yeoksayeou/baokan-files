Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 26th: The disaster-stricken compatriots in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City, Hong Kong, continue to receive relief from compatriots in Guangdong, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. People's organizations from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City donated 400 million yuan again in February to the disaster-stricken compatriots. This batch of donations was sent to Hong Kong a month ago, but because the British government in Hong Kong obstructed its distribution, it was delayed until March 24th before being issued on behalf of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions. Patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon have also donated money to help. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions recently distributed a batch of rice, with each disaster-stricken compatriot receiving three catties. In addition, the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao had received more than 48,000 Hong Kong dollars in donations entrusted by readers to the newspaper as of the 22nd.

    香港九龙城东头村受灾同胞
    继续得到祖国人民的救济
    【新华社广州二十六日电】香港九龙城东头村的受灾同胞继续受到广东、广州和香港同胞们的救济。广东省、广州市各界人民团体在二月间再度捐款四亿元给受灾同胞。这批捐款在一个月以前就已送到香港，因为香港英国政府阻挠分发，所以拖延到三月二十四日才由香港华商总会和港九工会联合会代为发出。香港、九龙的爱国同胞也纷纷捐款救济。港九工会联合会日前已代发一批大米，每个受灾同胞都领到了三斤。另外，香港大公报截至二十二日也收到读者委托该报转交的捐款四万八千多元港币。
