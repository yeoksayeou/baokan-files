“Rolled Back?” “Crawled Back!”
        Zhang Zhixiang

In Korea, during one battle, our landmines hit fifty-two enemy tanks, including American "Patton" tanks and British "Centurion" tanks. This incident led to mutual ridicule among the robbers.

Colonel Louth, commander of a British armored regiment, returned to Britain and ridiculed American tanks in a tank factory: "Too fragile, they are for Hollywood movies, not for combat." He said: "In one battle, fifty-two Allied tanks (half British, half American) were hit by Chinese landmines. All (?) British tanks were able to drive away on their own power, but every American tank had to be towed back." Therefore, he concluded: "The exchange rate in Korea is two 'Patton' tanks for one 'Centurion' tank."

When this news reached the U.S. Department of the Army, the Department of the Army felt very embarrassed and immediately denied that the "Centurion" was faster than the "Patton": "Although the 'Centurion' tank has some advantages, it is several tons heavier than the 'Patton' tank, but it is much slower than the 'Patton', and the performance of its main weapon is about the same as the 'Patton'."

After these robbers bumped their heads and bled, they are still comparing "treasures," but it is actually a ridiculous mutual mockery. They are no longer bragging about the "superiority" of their tanks, but are pointlessly competing to see who can escape faster, who drove back on their own, and who was towed back. This cannot but remind people of Ding Lang'er, who was collecting fishing tax silver in "Fishing and Killing Family." When Ding Yuanwai asked him if he had "rolled back" as Xiao En said, Ding Lang'er excused himself, saying: "How can I disgrace my father! I crawled back."

Anyway, it's good for the robbers to roll back. Let them pretend to be strong while pointing at their swollen faces!

    “滚回来的？”“爬回来的！”
    张致祥
    在朝鲜，一次战斗中，我们的地雷，炸中了敌人五十二辆坦克，里面有美国的“巴顿”式坦克，和英国的“百人队长”式坦克。这件事引起了强盗之间的相互讥嘲。
    英国装甲团的指挥官劳瑟上校回到英国，在坦克工厂里讥笑美国坦克：“太脆弱，它们是给好莱坞拍电影用的，而不是作战用的。”他说：“在一次战斗中，有五十二辆联军坦克（一半是英国的，一半是美国的），被中国人的地雷炸中。全部（？）英国坦克都能依靠自己的力量跑掉，但是，每一辆美国坦克都不得不拖回来。”因此他得出结论：“在朝鲜的交换率是两辆‘巴顿’式换一辆‘百人队长’式。”
    这个消息传到美国陆军部，陆军部感到很难堪，立即否认“百人队长”式比“巴顿”式跑得快：“虽然‘百人队长’式坦克有某些优点，它比‘巴顿’式坦克重几吨，但是它比‘巴顿’式慢得多，它的主要武器的性能和‘巴顿’式大约相同。”
    这些强盗们在碰得头破血流之后，还在比“宝”，而实际是一场哭笑不得的互相讥嘲。他们已不是在吹嘘他们的坦克“优势”了，而是在那里无聊地比赛谁逃跑得快，那个是自己跑回来的，那个是被拖回来的。这不能不使人想起“打渔杀家”中催讨渔税银子的丁郎儿，当丁员外问他是否照萧恩所说“滚回去”时，丁郎儿解嘲说：“咱怎么能给咱爷们丢脸！爬回来的。”
    不管怎么样吧，强盗们滚回去就行。让他们指着打肿了的脸充胖子吧！
