    The Glorious Gun of the Artillery Company
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Hua Shan

    On the front lines, the earthen walls of the underground bunkers trembled constantly, the sounds of artillery impacts reverberating through the earth day and night.

    Day had already broken. I got up to go to the First Company of the field artillery. The open ground at the mouth of the gully was full of shell craters, and at the crossroads, only an old locust tree with its branches hanging upside down remained. The sunny slope to the north had no snow, and the only way to pass was to cross the mountain from there, a dangerous place to brave the artillery fire. I strode quickly upwards, when suddenly I noticed several wisps of smoke rising at my feet. A narrow, sloping gully lay at the foot of the mountain, with several inhabited dugouts carved into the earthen banks on both sides of the gully. The trees and withered grass along the edge of the gully had been plowed up by artillery shells, but the shells either landed on this side of the gully or on the other, unable to turn and drill into the gully, making it surprisingly safe. Seeing this, I suddenly felt a sense of security, and I rushed to the ridge in one breath and took a rest on the shady slope.

    There was a small road on the flat plain below the mountain, with several bomb craters and shell craters lying on the nearby slopes. We advanced along the road, and the shell craters became more and more numerous. It turned out that there were several camouflaged thickets scattered at the foot of the mountain ahead, and from a distance, it was obvious that it was an artillery position. I thought to myself that artillery must be able to strike the enemy, but they also inevitably get hit often. But when I got closer, I could not see any cannons or traces of fortifications. It turned out to be a fake position entirely intended to fool American artillery shells. The liaison officer leading the way pointed to the mountain ridge diagonally opposite and said:
    "It's still over there!" Turning a corner, we walked into a depression and arrived at the edge of a messy earth pit by the stream, far away from the artillery-stricken road.

    Ahead was a saddle-shaped ridge, and the lowest ridge was bare, completely exposed, unable to hold snow. The small road happened to cross the mountain from there. "It's another artillery-prone spot, we must hurry across," I thought. The enemy reconnaissance plane was circling again. It was looking for our artillery position. Its tail twisted, and the whistling of artillery shells was heard in the low sky. Several shells passed overhead and landed on the north mountain, and several shells whistled behind the sound of the explosions, obviously hitting the south mountain. The targeted bombardment, one before and one after, was not aimed at here, so we just passed over the mountain. We walked up the earthen slope from the withered bushes, and a brand-new pine branch arch suddenly appeared before us. - I didn't expect to have arrived.

    The pine arch was half-hidden under the low slope, partially covering the entrance to the communication trench. The sentry stood beside it, with a shiny new artillery shell hanging behind him. This was a particularly beautiful "air raid alarm" unique to the artillery. The communication trench also showed the artillery's unique majestic style: wide, neat, tall, like an alleyway, with corners and diagonal passages; the earthen steps in the trench were like a section of curved stairs, allowing one to reach the hillside without leaving the trench.

    The cave entrances with pine arches were arranged along the trench, serving as shelters and artillery positions, and were even wider, sturdier, and as mighty as the cannons themselves. In particular, the command post's shelter, the white "cannon jacket" used to camouflage the entire artillery position, was just enough to stretch across the ceiling and one wall.

    Just then, the battalion command post called. The company commander picked up the receiver without getting out of bed, noted down the bombardment target on his knee, and then picked up another receiver to issue orders: "Everyone to your positions! To the left: one two five; scale division: three four seven... Is everyone ready? Three rounds per gun, fire together on my command!"

    Tense commands echoed from the receiver. The political instructor excitedly leaned over and said: "We're about to fire the cannons, let's go take a look!"

    I followed him out of the command post, running up the communication trench, and entered the artillery position. The ground suddenly trembled, and the nearby artillery positions opened fire, followed by a loud roar here, shaking the entire position and raising clouds of dust. Then came the second and third rounds - a burst of thunder passed. Everything calmed down again, and there was still the dazzling blue sky, with the lush mountains standing opposite.

    I peered through the gun scope: after looking and looking, it was always a door, wasn't it just the entrance to the corridor behind! I asked the gunner: "You can't see the enemy, and you can't see the target, how do you know if you hit it?"

    The political instructor smiled. He wasn't laughing at my ignorance of indirect fire, he was laughing at how they had doubted themselves not long ago. He talked about an unforgettable carbine.

    This was a trophy sent to them by the infantry at the forefront of the position. They hung it on the wall of the command post as the artillery's supreme honor. On the gun handle were engraved neat characters:

    "Captured on December 11, 1951, at Height 168." The upper inscription read: "Dedicated to the First Company of the Artillery x Regiment", and the lower inscription read: "Respectfully presented by the First Platoon of the Fifth Company of the Infantry x Regiment".

    I had heard this widely circulated story while on the front lines.

    Height 168 was an isolated hilltop protruding from the forefront of the front line, and the Fifth Company's Third Squad guarded it day and night. To the south was the enemy's commanding mountain position, just across a mile-wide depression; the Fifth Company's main position to the north was separated by five miles of open ground. The Fifth Company's Third Squad became an isolated target that the enemy stubbornly refused to let go of. Because the enemy could not attack north without taking it down. That night, the enemy's artillery fire roared again, covering even the adjacent positions to its rear. The area around the Third Squad's position was a sea of fire, and the rear route was completely cut off. The telephone lines between the Fifth Company's command post and the battalion command post were also broken by the artillery fire. It was with great difficulty that they managed to connect the wires under the artillery fire. The enemy had already launched a fierce attack on the Third Squad for half an hour, and the third charge had begun.

    This was the most frantic attack Height 168 had ever encountered. The artillery fire lasted for two full hours, and the loose soil on the hilltop was up to their ankles. At that time, the moonlight was hazy, and the comrades of the Third Squad had just emerged from the tunnel when the depression was already filled with a chaotic clamor. Black figures pushed and shoved, gesticulated, and kept crowding towards the hilltop, even more rampant than the first two times. The enemy's forces increased from a platoon to a company, and during the charge, they split into two groups. The soldiers waited calmly, letting the enemy reach the middle of the slope, and then a sudden barrage of hand grenades and automatic fire fiercely defeated the two groups of enemies. Just as they were about to organize a pursuit, fierce gunfire suddenly erupted from behind them, and more than two hundred enemies were outflanking them from the northeast corner.

    What vicious and cunning enemies! While making a noisy commotion in the front, the main force quietly inserted itself between the Fifth Company and the Third Squad, attacking up the mountain from the rear. And the northern hilltop was still erupting with enemy artillery fire, and the firepower of the main position could not support the Third Squad. The enemy became even more rampant: those in the northeast corner had already reached the middle of the slope, those in the south had turned back, and new enemy soldiers had appeared in the depression - more than five hundred people in groups, following one after another, just surging towards the hilltop. The situation was extremely serious, and they had to deal with it separately. The Third Squad soldiers set up their guns beside them, prepared piles of hand grenades, and both hands tightly gripped a pinch of fuse, refusing to give up their guns. The enemy charged into the effective range of the submachine guns, only sixty meters away, only fifty meters away, the clumsy appearance of the Americans could already be seen clearly, but the soldiers still leaned motionless against the chest wall, until the enemy was only forty meters away, the soldiers suddenly hurled their hands, - unexpectedly, the artillery barrage and the hand grenades bloomed together.

    The artillery fire that arrived in time, the artillery fire that landed in the enemy crowd, was what the Fifth Company Commander had just "invited." The telephone line to the battalion command post had just been connected, and a anxious voice immediately sounded in the receiver:

    "Do you need artillery support?" the battalion commander asked bluntly.
    "Yes!" "Where to hit?"
    "The front of the Third Squad!"
    In an instant, the four words "The front of the Third Squad" were transmitted to the artillery command post, and immediately turned into a string of numbers, which were transmitted separately to each artillery position. Ninety seconds later, the artillery shells tearing the air flew from all directions to the front of the Third Squad. Heartening news also spread from the telephone on Height 168 throughout the entire defense line and to the First Company of the field artillery.

    "Wang Ligong?" the artillery battalion commander shouted to the First Company Commander on the phone, "Your artillery is hitting well, the artillery shells are landing wherever the hand grenades land; each gun fire five more rounds!"

    Long-range artillery shells exploded together with the infantry's hand grenades, and bombarded the charging enemy as accurately as the hand grenades. - On this isolated hilltop with no rear route, what support could be more encouraging than this? The artillery fire became more and more fierce, and the hand grenades exploded more and more vigorously, only hitting the American soldiers who rolled and crawled to the south. As soon as they got up, they were knocked down again, and as soon as they dispersed, they were blasted into a group. The artillery fire continued to extend and pursue ruthlessly. Until the Third Squad's submachine guns could no longer hit living American soldiers, and the tracers of the light machine guns could not reach the stragglers, the artillery fire subsided. The comrades of the Third Squad then quickly drilled into the tunnels, bandaged their wounds in the air-raid shelters, wiped their weapons, opened new ammunition boxes, and prepared to meet new attacks. Only a sentry was left outside to observe the enemy's movements on the hillside.

    As expected, the enemy's artillery fire began to hit the small mountain again. This was the old routine. Whenever a charge collapsed, the enemy would definitely fire artillery again. However, this time it was not artillery fire before the charge. This was to cover the American soldiers who came out to collect corpses and drag away equipment. Shimmering black shadows slipped from the mouth of the gully under the mountain to the depression, and then dragged the corpses to the mouth of the gully. The scattered American soldiers also gathered there to rest. The sound of busy cars was heard in the gully. "They must be here to transport equipment," the sentry thought. "How exciting it would be to bombard them in the gully again at this time." While reporting the situation, he anxiously thought. Suddenly, artillery fire exploded in the mouth of the gully, as if the artillery shells had guessed his thoughts. The telephone in the First Company became even more lively.

    "It hit the enemy pile again!" The artillery battalion commander relayed the good news from the infantry on the front line. "They scattered, wait a moment... The enemy is dragging equipment again! Fire three more rounds on my command... A truckload of equipment is fully loaded. Everyone be prepared! ... It hasn't been pulled away yet! The enemy's equipment can't be pulled away. Fire again! Tell them to load another truck!"...

    The enemy pulled away a total of eight large trucks of corpses and equipment. The artillery battalion commander was so excited that he couldn't sleep all night, and picked up the phone in the quilt:

    "Wang Ligong, I will make a New Year couplet for you: Spend the New Year with quick eyes and hands; Wish victory with meticulous care."
    "I'll come up with a horizontal inscription: Fast, accurate, and fierce!" Company Commander Wang also smiled in bed. Suddenly, the voice of the Second Company Commander ran out of the receiver:
    "Your horizontal inscription is too short, I'll come up with a long one: Every artillery shell blossoms on the heads of the Americans!" Only the earphones vibrated with a burst of laughter. - It turned out that the gunners on the position were also listening around the telephone, and their laughter also participated in the "telephone evening party."

    The same laughter was also shaking in the air-raid shelters of the front-line infantry. They were veteran volunteer soldiers who fired the first shot of the war abroad, and all five battles were won by relying on rifles and hand grenades. They saw with their own eyes how difficult it was for the artillery to move a step at that time. Therefore, they were particularly excited about the power of today's artillery fire. Some said:

    "Looking at this artillery fire, I am happier than if I had made a great contribution. The Americans have tasted the taste of artillery shells!" Some said:
    "The artillery shells seem to understand what we want, and they hit wherever we want them to. My hand grenades almost 'fell behind'." Some said:
    "The enemy's artillery specializes in hitting the mountain, and our artillery specializes in hitting the heads of the Americans. This bill is enough for Truman to reimburse." Some said:
    "Artillery fire also participates in the front-line infantry's counterattacks. This is really something I never dreamed of. We have to celebrate the artillery's victory!"

    Speaking of celebrating the victory, everyone thought of giving gifts. But the trophies captured this time were all guns, ammunition, and the like, which the artillery could not use. There were only two cans of canned food and a piece of American coffee candy less than three inches long. This little bit of stuff, even if the front-line squad kept it for themselves, wouldn't be enough for everyone to have a bite. How could it be enough for anyone to eat if it was given to the artillery? "It's too little, it's not worth sending," someone said. Another said:
    "The candy of victory is especially sweet, no matter how little it is, it was captured by our own hands."

    One sentence expressed the wishes of all the infantry, and the soldiers all agreed. Later, in order to commemorate the victory created together, they picked out a repeating American carbine from the trophies. - This is the gun that the political instructor is now showing me, and personally sent a representative to the artillery regiment. The Fifth Company Commander took the gun and said to me:
    "I have been an artilleryman for five years, and I have never felt so glorious. Everyone from the regimental leaders to every soldier was moved."

    In the beginning, he said, this regiment was just a mixed-color mountain artillery battalion pulled by mules and horses. At that time, the Volunteer Army climbed mountains, took small roads, and advanced towards the invading army like a tide. They took advantage of every opportunity, hit them when they met them, and inserted themselves into the enemy's flanks and rear day and night. They fiercely attacked the American mechanized units along the highway, blocking them, surrounding them, and attacking them head-on... They beat them down and chased after them, and beat them again after they caught up. - In those continuous days and nights of more than a thousand miles, the infantry carried out successive penetrations and counterattacks. It was very difficult for the artillery to keep up. Just climbing a snowy slope required the entire company to hold two ropes that were dozens of meters long, dragging the cannon up with great effort, shouting with every step. Each mule and horse had to be held by the bridle, supported by the waist, and propped up by the butt. Just as a cannon climbed to the top of the mountain, the ranks of two infantry regiments had already passed by.

    Going uphill was difficult, and going downhill was even more difficult. Infantrymen who couldn't stand on their feet would sit down and slide down, cheerfully shouting "It's faster than an elevator!" If a cannon cart slid down the slope, it would fall off a cliff with people and cannons. The entire company had to drag a cannon from behind, and also had to restrain the horse's head from turning back. However, the pulling force was too great, and the cannon cart didn't roll down. If the pulling force was a little smaller, the cannon cart would slide down suddenly and couldn't stop. In an instant, the horse slipped, and the people stumbled. If they didn't quickly let go of the ropes in their hands, they would have to roll into the snow ditch.

    Several times, the mountain artillery battalion just caught up with the infantry, dug fortifications, and were about to fire the cannons, but the infantry continued to advance. - The enemy had already collapsed and fled, the battle line had moved far away, and they had to disassemble the cannons, carry them, and begin the same difficult march.

    "It's really uncomfortable to suffer hardship without fighting a battle and still being scolded everywhere!" Company Commander Wu stroked the carbine and said. At that time, all the anger in his stomach was unleashed on the enemy: "We have attacked bunkers and tanks, and we have never been scolded by the infantry from the Songhua River to Zhennanguan. Is it okay to be overwhelmed by American planes in Korea? We have to beat the enemy even if we run our legs off!" He rushed to the banks of the Linjin River in one breath, and finally fired the first shot of the New Year offensive, opening the way for the infantry. But until last summer, the battalion had not fired as many shells as this company had fired in a month. "I never thought I could get this gun."

    The regimental party committee decided to hold a grand "gun presentation ceremony" in the First Artillery Company to give them the precious gift of the front-line infantry.

    The gun presentation ceremony was held in this command post. The regimental political commissar, on behalf of all the artillery, raised the gun and said:

    "This was exchanged for blood by the infantry comrades. This is not an ordinary gun. This gun represents all the infantry's love for the artillery. It shows that our Volunteer Army can not only eliminate the enemy with rifles and hand grenades, but also become stronger and stronger, and can also eliminate the enemy in larger quantities with powerful artillery fire! What 'artillery superiority' and 'air superiority' can't stop us from developing artillery power! I propose that this gun be called 'Glorious Gun'!"

    Unable to find the words, the speeches at the meeting turned into excited oaths:

    "I guarantee that I will develop artillery power in the face of any enemy artillery fire to respond to the wishes of the infantry brothers!"
    "I guarantee that wherever the infantry attacks, the artillery fire will hit there, and every shell will hit the enemy's head!"
    "I guarantee to train three gunners a month and strive to make everyone proficient in technology!"
    "I guarantee that the telephone will be open at all times, and that no situation will delay the firing of the cannons!"...
    "Maintain glory, develop glory!"

    Everyone wanted to express their determination in front of the "Glorious Gun." However, they couldn't leave their battle stations and couldn't all attend the ceremony. So someone suggested that the carbine's bullets be called "Glorious Bullets," and that each squad be given one to be taken back by the representatives to convey the infantry's wishes.

    "There is also Glorious Candy!" The political instructor said to me, opening the artillery shell iron box under the table and taking out a small paper packet from under the documents.

    "Oh, it's flattened." He said with regret, opening the paper packet in his palm and holding it out for me to see: half a transparent trademark paper covered a small piece of coffee candy that had been broken by hand. He said that it was also sent by Height 168, and it was originally a whole piece sealed. The lives of the front-line infantry brothers were much harder. They couldn't bear to eat even this little piece of candy that they had captured, and specially sent it through several artillery fire blockade lines to the artillery, which was really touching. But there was too little candy, and it was difficult to divide, so the company headquarters immediately broke the coffee candy into several pieces and distributed them to the comrades in each artillery position. Because their artillery hit well, they had this glory, and the gunners should all have a taste. This small piece of candy was given to the First Squad of gunners.

    The comrades of the First Squad were very moved and immediately held a meeting to discuss: "Who does the glory belong to?" They unanimously believed that the drivers worked hard to feed the horses and drag the cannons, and had suffered countless hardships along the way to bring the cannons here. Otherwise, how could the gunners be able to fire the shells on the enemy's heads? "The drivers are the ones who are glorious!" they said. So they sent a representative to give the candy to the driver's squad.

    But the comrades of the driver's squad said: The cooks have made the greatest contribution. They are busy day and night, whether marching or fighting. When they arrive at the front, they can eat good meals and good dishes every meal. It's tiring enough to grind tofu every day, not to mention that one kind of soybean can make seven kinds of dishes. They worked hard to improve their lives, ensuring that everyone was strong and full of energy. The fortifications were also repaired, and the technology was improved, so we have today's glory. This piece of candy should be given to the cooks.

    But the comrades of the cooking squad said: Our artillery hits well, and this is all due to the leadership and guidance of the superiors; all the comrades in the company are united in one effort, so we have this glory. The company commander and political instructor have made the greatest contribution. So they sent the candy back to the company headquarters. The political instructor said:

    "At that time, I was so touched that I didn't know what to do. As soon as I took the candy, I thought of Chairman Mao. If it weren't for the long-term cultivation and education and careful leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, how could we, these peasant children, have what we have today? I wanted to send it to Chairman Mao immediately. But how can I present this little bit of candy? If I don't send it, I will betray the infantry brothers' good intentions. So I kept it in the document box until today." He carefully wrapped the candy and squatted down to open the document box, then suddenly turned his head:

    "Old Wang, -" he called to the company commander. "Can't we ask Comrade Hua Shan to take it back to Beijing?"
    The company commander did not answer, but smiled and asked me:

    "Is it okay?" He smiled so innocently, obviously not afraid that I would be burdened, but wanting me to support them. I said: Chairman Mao will be very happy to see this candy. The political instructor immediately stood up and said:

    "I think so too, Chairman Mao will definitely not laugh at us; this is a little wish from our front line. I'll write a letter!"

    He wiped the table again and again before opening the map portfolio and taking out a stack of unused letter paper. This was from the people of the motherland. He leaned on the table and wrote, then suddenly frowned:

    "Why is my handwriting so bad today? I can't write well."
    "Just write out our wishes!" The company commander, who was guarding the telephone, said: "Don't write small characters, so that the old man doesn't have to strain his eyes."

    "That's right!" He put down his pen, changed another piece of paper, and then wiped the ink off the tip of the pen before writing two full pages stroke by stroke. Finally, he wrote:

    "... We got the candy, and we felt unspeakable glory, and immediately thought of Chairman Mao. With your wise leadership, the long-term cultivation of the Party, and the great support of the motherland, we can transform from an ordinary peasant into an internationalist fighter who masters modern artillery technology, step onto the Korean battlefield, make contributions to peaceful mankind, and create victory. This glory belongs entirely to you, Chairman Mao. But it is too little to send you half a piece of candy, and it is not easy to mail it, and we are afraid that you will laugh at us. If we don't send it, we feel that we should not enjoy this glory. So we have kept it until today. It just so happens that Xinhua News Agency Comrade Hua Shan is here. Although we have little candy, it is a little wish from all of us. You will definitely not laugh at us. Please accept it! We are determined to work harder this year to improve our technology and strive for greater glory to respond to your and the Party's cultivation and the hopes of the people of the motherland!"

    炮兵连的光荣枪
    新华社记者　华山
    在火线上，地下工事的土墙不时抖动着，透过地皮的炮火撞击声日夜不断。
    天已大亮。我起身到野炮第一连去。沟口的开阔地上满是弹坑，交叉路口只剩下一棵枝枒倒挂的老槐树，北面的光山坡没有积雪，必经的小路就从那里翻过山去，正是挺着肚皮挨炮的危险地带。我迈着大步，紧往上走，忽然发现几处炊烟在脚下冒着。山根伏着一道窄窄的斜沟，几个住人的地洞掏在沟缝里的两侧土坎下，沟沿的树木和枯草已经叫炮弹犁翻了，可是炮弹不是落在沟这边就是沟那边，没法拐弯钻进沟里，真是安全得出奇。看到了这些，自己也突然觉得有了依靠似的，一口气上了山脊，几步抢过阴坡休息起来。
    山下的平川地上有条小公路，左近的山坡上躺着几片炸弹坑和炮弹坑。我们顺着公路前进，路旁的弹坑越来越多了，原来前面的山脚下散乱着几处伪装的树丛，远远就看出那是个炮兵阵地。大概炮兵要能揍上敌人，自己也难免常常挨揍的，我这样想着。到跟前却看不到炮也看不到工事的痕迹，原来完全是一座胡弄美国炮弹的假阵地。带路的通讯员指着斜对过的山岗说：
    “还在那边呢！”一拐弯就走进洼地，到了溪边的乱土坑旁边，已远离挨炮的公路了。
    前面是马鞍形的一溜山岗，最矮的山梁也是光秃秃的，完全坦露，挂不住雪，小路正好从那里翻过大山。“又是个挨炮的口子，得赶快过。”我想着。敌人的侦察机又盘旋过来了。这是在寻找我们的炮兵阵地的。它的尾巴一扭，低空果然响起了炮弹的嘶声，几炮越过头顶，落在北山那边了，几炮的嘶声在爆炸声的后面，显然是打在南山那边的。有目标的轰击，一前一后，都不是打的这里，正好翻山过去。我们从枯树丛走上土坡，眼前突然现出一座崭新的松枝彩门。——没料想这就到了。
    松门半藏在矮坡下，虚掩着交通壕口，哨兵在旁边站着，身后吊着一个金闪闪的新炮弹壳。这是炮兵特有的一种最漂亮的“防空警钟”。交通壕也显出炮兵特有的磅礴气派：宽大，齐崭，高出一头，就像胡同夹道那样，有拐角，有斜巷；壕里的土阶却像一段弧形的楼梯，不出壕沟就能绕到半坡上去。
    搭着松门的洞口顺着壕沟排列着，那是隐蔽部和炮阵地，里面更加宽大，壮实，和大炮本身一样威武。特别是连指挥所的隐蔽部，用来伪装整个炮阵地的白色“炮衣”也刚够它绷满天棚和一面墙。
    正好营指挥所来了电话。连长不离床沿便拿起听筒，一只手就着膝盖记下射轰目标，跟手拿起另一个听筒发布命令：“各就炮位！向左：一二五；标尺分划：三四七……都准备好没有？每炮三发，听口令齐放！”
    听筒回响着紧张的口令，指导员也兴奋的凑了过来说：“马上就打炮，咱看看去！”
    我跟着他跑出指挥所，顺交通壕往上跑着，进入了炮阵地。地皮忽然一阵抖动，附近的炮阵地开火了，接着这里也轰然猛吼起来了，只震得阵地里烟尘滚滚。跟着又是第二发，第三发——一阵雷声过去了。一切又平静下来，依然是耀眼的蓝天，葱郁的山岗在对面横着。
    我凑着炮镜往前看：看来看去总是一座门，可不正是背后的走廊进口！我问炮手：“你们也看不到敌人，也看不到目标，怎么知道打中没有呢？”
    指导员笑了。他不是笑我不懂间接射击，他笑的是不久以前，他们也是这样怀疑自己的。他谈起了一枝永世难忘的卡宾枪。
    这是阵地最前沿的步兵送给他们的胜利品。他们把它挂在指挥所的墙上，当做炮兵无上的荣誉。枪柄上刻着端正的字迹：
    “一九五一年十二月十一日缴获于一六八高地。”上款是：“献给炮兵×团第一连”，下款是：“步兵×团五连一排敬赠”。
    早在前沿阵地的时候，我就听到这个传颂一时的故事了。
    一六八高地是突出在第一线阵地最前沿的孤立小山头，五连的第三班在那里日夜坚守着。南面是敌人踞高临下的山岳阵地，就在一里宽的一片洼地那边；北面的五连主阵地却隔着五里宽的开阔地。五连第三班就成了敌人死啃不放的孤立目标。因为敌人不打掉它就不能向北攻击。那天晚上，敌人的炮火又猛轰起来，连它侧后的友邻阵地都打遍了。五连三班的阵地周围更是一片火海，后路完全断绝。五连指挥所和营指挥所的电话线也被炮火轰断。好容易才把炮火下的电线接通，敌人已经向三班猛攻了半个钟头，第三次冲锋又开始了。
    这是一六八高地从没碰到过的疯狂进攻。炮火足足轰了两个钟头，山头上的浮土都没到脚脖子了。当时月色朦胧，三班的同志刚刚钻出坑道，洼地里已经叽哩哇啦的嚷成一片，黑越越的人影推推拥拥，指手划脚地，一劲儿围向山头，比头两次更加猖狂了。敌人兵力从一个排增加到一个连，冲着冲着又分成两路。战士们沉着等待着，把敌人放上半坡，然后，又是一阵突然的手榴弹和自动火力，硬把两路敌人打垮了。正要组织火力追击，屁股后面忽然响起了激烈的枪声，二百多敌人从东北角包抄上来了。
    好恶毒狡猾的敌人！它在正面吵吵嚷嚷，主力却悄悄插到五连和三班之间，兜屁股打上山来。而北面的山头依然迸裂着敌人的炮火，主力阵地的火力没法支援三班。敌人这就更加猖狂了：东北角的已经冲到半坡，南面的又回过头来，洼地里也出现了新的敌兵，——五百多人一伙跟着一伙，只管涌向山头。情况严重透顶，只有分头对付。三班战士们在身边架好枪，准备好一堆堆的手榴弹，两只手都紧扣住一撮炸弹火弦，硬不还枪。敌人冲到冲锋枪的有效射程里了，只隔六十公尺了，只隔五十公尺了，长腿拱腰的草包样子已经可以看清楚了，战士们还是一动不动地倚着胸墙，直到敌人只隔四十公尺的时候，大伙才突然把手一抡，——意想不到，排炮也和手榴弹一块儿开花了。
    及时赶到的炮火，炮炮落在敌人人群中的炮火，这是五连长刚刚“请”来的。通到营指挥所的电话线刚刚接好，听筒里马上响起焦灼的声音：
    “要炮火支援吗？”营长劈头就问。
    “要啊！”“打哪里？”
    “三班前沿！”
    顷刻之间，“三班前沿”这四个字传到炮兵指挥所，立刻又变成一串串的数目字，分头传到各个炮阵地。九十秒钟以后，嘶裂空气的炮弹嘶声便从各处飞向三班前沿。振奋人心的捷报也从一六八高地的电话传遍整个防线，传到野炮第一连来了。
    “王立功吗？”炮兵营长在电话里喊着一连长，“你们的炮打得好，手榴弹打到哪里炮弹就落在哪里；各炮再打五发！”
    远射程炮弹和步兵的手榴弹一起爆炸，和手榴弹一样准确地轰击着冲锋的敌人，——在这后路断绝的孤立山头上，还有什么样的支援比这更鼓舞人呢？炮火越轰越猛，手榴弹也越炸越起劲，只打的美国兵连滚带爬地向南涌着，刚爬起来又叫掀倒，刚刚散开又叫炸成一团，炮火还是无情地延伸追击。直到三班的冲锋枪也打不上活的美国兵了，轻机枪的曳光弹也够不着掉队的敌人了，炮火这才沉寂下来。三班的同志于是赶紧钻进坑道，到防炮洞里裹伤口，擦武器，打开新的弹药箱，准备迎接新的攻击。外面只留一个监视哨在坡头观察敌人动静。
    果然，敌人的炮火又朝小山打起来了。这是老规矩，每逢冲锋垮台以后，敌人准又打炮。不过这次不是冲锋前的炮火了。这是掩护鬼子兵出来收尸拖彩号的。闪悠悠的黑影从大山下的沟口溜到洼地，又拖着一条条死尸溜到沟口。跑散了的美国兵也聚拢在那里休息。沟里响起了忙乱的汽车声。“准是来运彩号的，”监视哨想。“这时候再朝沟里轰他一顿炮，该多带劲。”他一面报告情况，一面着急地想着。突然，排炮又在沟口爆烈开来，就像炮弹猜透了他的心意那样。炮一连的电话也更加热闹了。
    “又打到敌人堆里啦！”炮兵营长转来了前沿步兵的捷报。“跑散了，等一等……敌人又拖彩号啦！听口令再打三发……装了一汽车彩号，满满的。各炮准备好！……还没拉完呢！敌人的彩号拉不完了。再打！叫它再装一汽车！”……
    敌人总共拉走了八大卡车的死尸和彩号，炮兵营长也兴奋的一夜没睡着，在被筒里又拿起电话：
    “王立功，我做一副新年对联送给你们：度新春眼明手快；祝胜利心细如毛。”
    “我来个横批：快准猛！”王连长也在床上乐着。听筒里忽然跑出二连长的声音：
    “你的横批太短了，我来个长的：炮炮落在老美头上开花！”只说的耳机震起好一阵哄笑，——原来阵地上的炮手们也围着电话听着，他们的笑声也参加了“电话晚会”了。
    同样的笑声也在前沿步兵的防炮洞里震荡着。他们是首先打响出国第一仗的志愿军老战士，一连五个战役都是靠的步枪手榴弹打败敌人，他们亲眼看到那时炮兵走一步路多末困难。因此他们对今天的炮火威力特别感到兴奋。有的说：
    “看着这顿炮火，我比立了大功还要高兴，老美可尝上炮弹的滋味了！”有的说：
    “炮弹就像懂人心意似的，咱想打哪里它就抡到哪里。我的手榴弹差点没‘掉队’了。”有的说：
    “敌人的炮专打山头，我们的炮专打老美的头，这笔账够杜鲁门报销的。”有的说：
    “炮火也参加前沿步兵打反击，这真是做梦也想不到。咱们得给炮兵庆功！”
    一提起庆功，大伙就想到送礼。可是这次缴获的胜利品都是些枪枝弹药之类，炮兵用不上。吃的只有两筒罐头和一块不到三寸长的美国咖啡糖。这点子东西，前沿班留下自己吃也不够一人一口，送给炮兵够谁吃的？“太少了，值不得送。”有人这样说。另一个却说：
    “胜利的糖格外甜，再少也是咱们亲手缴获的。”
    一句话说出了全体步兵的心意，战士们都一致赞成了。以后，为了纪念共同创造的胜利，他们又从这次的胜利品里挑出一支连发的美国卡宾枪，——就是现在指导员拿给我看的这支枪，亲自派代表送给炮兵团。五连长接过枪去对我说：
    “我当了五年炮兵，从没感到这样光荣过。从团首长到每个战士都感动了。”
    开始的时候，他说，这个团还只是一个骡马牵引的杂色山炮营。那时候志愿军翻大山，抄小路，迎着潮水般的侵略军队前进着，见缝就钻，碰上就打，没日没夜地插到敌人的侧翼和后方，跟公路沿线的美国机械化死纠猛打，一路上截住打，兜住打，迎头打，……按倒就揍，跑了就追，追上再打，——在那连绵一千多里的日日夜夜里，步兵一次紧接一次地穿插反击，炮兵要跟上是非常困难的。光是上个雪坡，就得全连人拉住两根十几丈长的大缆索，拖住炮身往上挣扎，一步三吆喝的；每匹骡马还得人抓住笼头拖着，扶住腰推着，托住屁股顶着。一门炮刚刚爬上山头，两个步兵团的行列早已超越过去了。
    上坡难，下坡更不容易。步兵站不住脚就坐着往下溜，还乐的直嚷“比电梯还快！”炮车一溜坡就连人带炮都摔下悬崖了。得全连人在后面拖住一门炮，头里还得勒住马头往回蹩。可是拖劲太大了，炮车又不往下滚，拖劲小了一点，炮车猛一滑又煞不住脚，瞬时间马也溜坡了，人也绊倒了，不赶快松开手里的缆索，连自己也得跟着滚进大雪沟了。
    很有几次，山炮营刚刚追上步兵，挖好阵地，正要打炮，步兵又继续前进了。——敌人已经溃逃，战线已经远去，又得把炮拆开，扛上，开始了同样艰难的进军。
    “光吃苦打不上仗，还到处挨骂，这滋味真不好受啊！”五连长抚摸着卡宾枪说。那时候，满肚子的火气一下子全抡到敌人头上了：“我们打过地堡，打过坦克，从松花江打到镇南关也没叫步兵骂过；到朝鲜叫美国飞机压倒还行？跑断了腿也要揍上敌人！”一口气赶到临津江边，总算打响了新年攻势的头一炮，给步兵轰开道路了。可是一直打到去年夏天，全营打的炮弹，还没这个连一个月来打的多。“真想不到能熬出这枝枪来。”
    团党委决定在炮一连举行一个隆重的“受枪典礼”，把前沿步兵的高贵礼物送给他们。
    受枪典礼就在这个指挥所里举行。团政治委员代表全体炮兵举起枪说：
    “这是步兵同志用血换来的，这不是普通的枪，这枝枪代表着步兵热爱炮兵的全部心意。它说明了我们志愿军不仅能用步枪手榴弹消灭敌人，而且愈战愈强，也能够用强大的炮火，更大量地消灭敌人了！什么‘炮火优势’‘空中优势’都挡不住我们发扬炮火威力了！我提议把这枝枪叫做‘光荣枪’！”
    千言万语不知从何说起，会上的讲话都变成了激动的宣誓：
    “我保证在敌人任何炮火面前都要发扬炮火威力，回答步兵兄弟的心意！”
    “我保证步兵攻到那里炮火就打到那里，炮炮打到敌人头上！”
    “我保证一个月培养三个炮手，争取做到人人精通技术！”
    “我保证电话时刻畅通，任何情况不耽误打炮！”……
    “保持光荣，发扬光荣！”
    每个人都想亲到“光荣枪”面前表示决心。可是战斗岗位离不开，不能都来参加典礼，于是又有人提议把卡宾枪的子弹叫做“光荣弹”，送给每班一粒，让代表们带回去传达步兵的心意。
    “还有光荣糖呢！”指导员对我说着，打开桌子下的炮弹铁箱，从文件底下拿出一个小纸包来。
    “哎呀，压扁了。”他惋惜着，就着手心打开纸包，托给我看：半截透明的商标纸套着一小块用手折开的咖啡糖。他说，这也是一六八高地送来的，本来是原封装着的一整块。前沿步兵兄弟们的生活苦多了，缴获到这末一块糖也舍不得吃，特意穿过几道炮火封锁线送给炮兵，真是太感动人了。可是糖太少，不好分，连部立刻把咖啡糖折成几块，分送给各个炮阵地的同志们。因为他们的炮打得好，才有这个光荣，应该让炮手们都尝上一点。这一小块糖就是送给炮手第一班的。
    一班的同志非常感动，立刻开会讨论起来：“光荣是谁的呢？”他们一致认为，驭手们辛辛苦苦地喂马，拖炮，一路上不知吃了多少苦头，才能把炮拉到这里。要不炮手怎么能把炮弹抡到敌人头上呢？“还是驭手光荣！”他们说。于是派代表把糖送给驭手班。
    可是驭手班的同志们说：还是炊事班功劳大。他们无论行军作战，都是日夜不停地忙着，到了前线还能餐餐吃上好饭好菜，光是天天磨豆腐就够累的，更不用说一种黄豆能做七种菜了。他们辛辛苦苦，改善生活，保证了个个身强力壮，精神饱满，工事也修好了，技术也提高了，才有今天的光荣。这块糖应该送给炊事班。
    可是炊事班的同志说：咱们的炮打的好，这都是上级指挥领导出来的；全连同志拧成一股劲，才有这份光荣。还是连长和指导员的功劳大。于是又把这块糖送到连部来。指导员说：
    “当时我只感动的不知怎样才好，一接过糖就想起毛主席来。要不是党和毛主席的长期培养教育，操心领导，我们这些农家孩子能有今天吗？当下就想送给毛主席。可是这点子糖怎么拿得出手呢？不送去吧，又辜负了步兵兄弟一番心意。只好放到文件箱里，直到今天。”他把糖轻轻包好，蹲下去打开文件箱，忽然扭转头来：
    “老王，——他喊着连长。咱就不能请华山同志捎回北京去？”
    连长没有答话，却笑着问我：
    “行吗？”他笑得这样天真，显然不是怕我带着累赘，而是要我支持他们。我说：毛主席看到这块糖，一定很高兴的。指导员立刻站起来说：
    “我也这样想，毛主席一定不会笑话；这是我们前线的一点心意。我来写信！”
    他把桌子擦了又擦，才打开地图皮囊，拿出一叠从没用过的信纸。这是祖国人民慰劳的。他伏在桌上写着，忽然皱起眉头：
    “今天这字怎么搞的？老写不好。”
    “把咱们的心意写出来就行啊！”连长在电话机旁边守着说：“可别写小字，叫他老人家费眼神。”
    “可不是！”他放下钢笔，换了一张纸，然后擦干净笔尖的墨水，一笔一划地写了满满两页。最后写道：
    “……我们拿到了糖，感到说不出的光荣，立刻想起毛主席您来。我们有了您的英明领导，有了党的长期培养，有了祖国的伟大支援，才能从一个普通农民变成一个掌握现代炮兵技术的国际主义战士，走上朝鲜战场，为和平人类立功，创造胜利。这个光荣完全是属于毛主席您老人家的。可是这半块糖送给您又太少了，不好邮寄，还怕您笑话。不送吧，又觉得这光荣不该我们享受。所以一直留到今天。正好新华社华山同志来了。我们糖虽然少，都是我们大家一点心意。您老人家一定不会笑话的。请您收下吧！我们决心在今年更加努力提高技术，争取更大的光荣，来回答您和党的培养，回答祖国人民的希望！”
