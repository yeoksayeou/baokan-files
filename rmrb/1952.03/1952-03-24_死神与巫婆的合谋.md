    The Conspiracy of Death and the Witch
    Feng Xuefeng
    We refute all shameless lies, not to prove the facts. The facts are immutable and need no proof. However, refuting all lies makes the facts even clearer, especially to expose conspiracies. Without exception, every lie represents a conspiracy, although lying varies in cunning and clumsiness.

    All the lies fabricated by the American robbers to deny their crimes have been shattered. This makes the crimes of these war criminals even more obvious, and they await only the judgment of the world people's court. However, once a conspiracy is exposed and bankrupt, a second conspiracy that will also go bankrupt will emerge, still wrapped in the cloak of new lies.

    For example, recently, amid the anger and righteous roars of people all over the world, the Ridgway headquarters and Washington have been somewhat panicked, which even the robbers' own propaganda organs cannot hide. But what is the panic about? According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 19th of this month, it is because Acheson and his gang's criminal conspiracy has been exposed by the people of China and Korea and all righteous people around the world. According to the London "Daily Herald" of the 18th of this month, as reflected by the "Tokyo Observer," this panic is even more obviously due to the fact that the American fabrication of the lie that "the Communists want to shift the responsibility for the plague to the Americans" no longer fools anyone. The anger of the Chinese and Korean people is unstoppable, and the matter has become international.

    Everyone can correctly judge that this is the reason for the panic of the American robber chiefs. Not to mention the governments and people of Korea and China, people of all countries in the world have made irresistible and strong statements. The World Peace Council has issued a call to battle to the whole world; even the United Nations Secretariat constantly receives protest letters from people of various countries. Soviet representative Malik has already raised the issue of discussing the use of bacteriological weapons by the United States in Korea at the United Nations Disarmament Commission.

    Did the American robbers not think beforehand that Malik would raise this issue? Judging from the frightened state shaken by Malik's voice, it seems that they did not think beforehand, just as they did not think beforehand that the people of Korea, China, and the world would issue such a powerful denunciation. The American robbers will not think about the power of the world people's righteous forces. But in this way, a new scene of bankruptcy unfolds around the United Nations Disarmament Commission meeting held in New York, and the main program is still Acheson's clamoring and unfulfilled conspiracy—demanding that China and Korea agree to allow the International Red Cross to come to North Korea and China to "investigate." This is a rather "interesting" scene, if you are interested in seeing it as "interesting."

    Initially, Acheson clamored for such an "investigation" in order to carry out a "kill two birds with one stone" scheme. The United States had been preparing for germ warfare for ten years, and it was the first time to "test" bacteriological weapons in Korea. The effect of this "test" is not only related to the past ten years of preparation but also to future plans for aggressive warfare and its diplomatic intimidation policy. Although Simes had sneaked into North Korea between December 1950 and January 1951 to investigate the effects when smallpox bacteria were spread in Korea, it was obviously not accurate enough; this time it was a larger-scale "test," and it was naturally more urgent to know the effect. In this way, if the plot of "investigation" really succeeds, it can not only use the lies of the International Red Cross to prove that "natural causes of plague" or "the Communists are unable to cope with the health of the people under their control" are "true," but also "investigate" the effects of bacteriological weapons. And if the plot is not sold, it is still a pretext for denying the crime. But none of this is "interesting"; what is "interesting" is that his plot finally sells for nothing and still cannot be used as a pretext for denial.

    But what now? Still, the heart has not died, and it still wants to continue the already bankrupt conspiracy; in fact, there is no better magic weapon other than this. But now it is in an even more forced state, so it must shout even louder. In fact, Soviet representative Malik has already grabbed the United States by the throat; therefore, if it does not shout loudly, it may be strangled to death. This is why American representative Cohen, who attended the United Nations Disarmament Commission meeting, is roaring with bravado in New York, and United Nations Secretary-General Lie is also anxious.

    Malik's direct questioning is indeed distressing to the American robbers. Malik declared: "I raise the following questions to the American representative and the committee with a very serious attitude: 'Since the Disarmament Commission cannot avoid the most practical issues in terms of armament, then it cannot ignore the recent events such as the use of bacteriological weapons by the American army in Korea and China to massacre civilians on a large scale. Shouldn't the Disarmament Commission therefore immediately consider the issue of violating the ban on bacteriological warfare—a shameful war incompatible with the conscience of honest people and the conscience of civilized people—so that bacteriological weapons cannot be used in the future and those who violate the ban on bacteriological warfare are brought to justice?'"

    The American dismay was immediately manifested by the American delegation.

    But the American delegation could not answer this question on the spot, and its representative Cohen used a pile of lies slandering the Soviet Union to replace the answer at the press conference on the 15th of March and the regular meeting of the Disarmament Commission on the 19th. At the press conference on the 15th, Cohen said: "Malik did not ask for an investigation, but generally demanded to condemn the United States and declare such weapons illegal." "The United States has requested the International Committee of the Red Cross to conduct a thorough on-site investigation." "The United States will insist on an investigation, regardless of whether the Soviet Union cooperates or not."… In short, it is "investigation," "investigation," and there is no other reliance besides this.

    This is indeed somewhat forced and at a loss, and has to be incoherent, but in the incoherent denial, the truth is still revealed. For example, this American representative accused Malik of "generally declaring such weapons illegal," which means that the United States at least generally acknowledges that such weapons are legal. So, what exactly is the "investigation," "investigation" trying to do, and what can it do?

    Everyone knows that the American robbers just want to shout like this, and can only shout like this. Really, what else can they do besides shout like this? Everything ends here, and what follows is complete failure. Wasn't there a story about how the devil finally ended up? This is probably a story that all nations have circulated in roughly the same way: the devil intends to harm an honest fisherman and his beautiful daughter because the fisherman's family has a pearl, which the fisherman plucked from the sea for his beloved daughter. The devil believes that the pearl is very unfavorable to it because at night, the pearl is placed by the fisherman's daughter's pillow, emitting a bright light that illuminates the fisherman's cottage, making the devil afraid. However, every time the devil approached the cottage, it was frightened back by the bright light, and finally failed to kill the fisherman and his daughter and steal the pearl. Later, it went dejectedly to seek help from a witch it had a liaison with, wanting to rely on the witch's witchcraft to achieve its purpose; but the witch was also afraid of the light and dared not approach, but stood far away and cursed, also to no avail. In the end, both the devil and the witch were ashamed of their failure and threw themselves into the sea and died.

    It is indeed a beautiful story!

    But for the United States, the devil should be replaced by death or the plague demon, which is more in line with the profession of Truman, Acheson, and others. At the same time, the American robbers will never throw themselves into the sea out of shame unless they are beaten to death. Apart from these two points, everything else is very much in line with the current situation in the United States, because the evidence that frightens it is as clear as the fisherman's pearl and cannot be eliminated, and the fisherman's pearl accurately symbolizes the anger of the people of China and Korea and the world and the power manifested by the anger, making Acheson and his ilk at a loss, so it has to ask the witch to help, and curse together.

    Cohen is naturally not playing the role of a witch. He is a direct small demon of Acheson. Cohen's grimaces and bravado "sense of humor" lie in the fact that the opposite of his lies is the truth, and he precisely demonstrates America's panic.

    But the so-called International Red Cross and United Nations Secretary-General Lie are precisely the witches that Acheson and his ilk are in collusion with. Acheson said: "We have requested the International Committee of the Red Cross to conduct an impartial on-site investigation, and the International Committee of the Red Cross has agreed." This is quite "humorous." But the most "humorous" is the Philippine "Manila Times," which said: "The International Committee of the Red Cross may be the only completely impartial and non-partisan organization in the world." Have you heard of it? The witch who is in collusion with the devil is selling the devil's plot, but it is said to be "impartial and non-partisan," and "completely" and "only"!

    Lie said: "Malik's accusation that the American army is conducting germ warfare in Korea is false. Only when the Soviet Union and China and Korea allow the investigation team to enter the country and go to the scene to investigate the truth of this accusation can it best show the sincerity of the accuser." Lie's "humor" also lies in the fact that he does a good job as a witch.

    Acheson and his ilk are thus staging a farce close to the final scene with the witch. Failure is inevitable because this conspiring plot cannot be sold.

    Although the reactionary science of the United States is degenerating into manufacturing mass-killing weapons, and people like Columbia University professor Rhodesbury are still propagating such death "gospels" after propagating bacteriological weapons: "What's the difference between a person dying easily or dying painfully? He will die anyway, and in the end, he is nothing but a corpse." However, when the time of failure comes, even the devil has to throw himself into the sea, right? Moreover, the American robbers are not allowed to do whatever they want!

    We understand very well that we cannot get honesty from robbers, only catch him and kill him! We cannot ask for humanity and survival from death either, only catch it and hang it! In order to prevent the devils who are not tolerated by mankind from escaping, we can only carry out all struggles; and the power of the world's people has made the day when these robbers and devils are brought to justice not far away.

    死神与巫婆的合谋
    冯雪峰
    我们驳斥一切无耻的谎话，原不是为了证明事实，事实是不可改易的，再也用不到什么证明。但是，驳斥一切谎话，却也使事实更明显，尤其这是为了揭穿阴谋的。从来没有例外：每一句谎话总代表着一种阴谋，虽然说谎也有狡黠和拙劣的不同。
    美国强盗们制造出来以抵赖罪行的一切谎话，都被粉碎了。这样，就使这些战犯们的罪行更明显，等待他们的只有世界人民法庭的裁判。可是，一个阴谋被揭露而破产了，第二个仍然要破产的阴谋又会产生出来，而且仍然要包裹在新的谎话的外衣里。
    譬如近日来，在全世界人民的愤怒和正义的吼声之中，李奇微总部和华盛顿都有些慌乱了，这是强盗们自己的宣传机关也掩盖不了的。但是，慌乱什么呢？据美联社本月十九日东京电讯看起来，这是由于艾奇逊及其一伙的罪恶阴谋已被中朝两国人民和全世界正义人类所揭穿了。而据伦敦本月十八日的“每日先驱报”看起来，则由“东京观察家”所反映，这种慌乱更显然是由于美国捏造“共产党想把瘟疫的责任推给美国人”的谎言已经骗不了人了，中国人民和朝鲜人民的愤怒是不可遏止的，事情已经成为国际性的了。
    谁都能正确判断，这都是美国强盗头子慌乱的原因。朝、中两国的政府和人民不用说，世界各国人民都有不可抗拒的强硬的表示。世界和平理事会已向全世界发出战斗的号召；就是联合国秘书处也不断地接到从各国来的人民的抗议书。而苏联代表马立克又已经在联合国裁减军备委员会上，提出要求讨论美国在朝鲜使用细菌武器的问题了。
    美国强盗难道事前没有想到过马立克会提出这个问题来的么？从那为马立克的声音所震动而惊惶的情状看起来，好像事前没有想到过，正如他们事前没有想到过朝鲜、中国以及全世界人民会发出如此强大的声讨一样。美国强盗是不会去想世界人民正义力量的强大的。但这样，新的破产的一幕，就又围绕着在纽约举行的联合国裁减军备委员会会议而展开了，那主要的节目仍然是艾奇逊所叫嚷和念念不忘的一个不能如愿以偿的阴谋——要求朝、中两国答应国际红十字会到北朝鲜和中国来“调查”。这是颇“有趣”的一幕，假如你有兴趣把它看作
    “有趣”的话。
    起初，艾奇逊叫嚷着这样的“调查”，原是想进行一个“一箭双雕”的勾当。本来美国准备细菌战已十年了，而在朝鲜还是初次“试验”细菌武器，这个“试验”的效果如何，不仅关系着过去的十年准备，并且关系着今后的侵略战争计划及其外交恐吓政策的。虽然在一九五○年十二月至一九五一年一月间在朝鲜撒布了天花细菌时，赛姆斯已经潜入北朝鲜调查过效果了，然而显然还不够确切；这一回又是更大规模的“试验”，要知道效果，自然是更迫切的。这样，如果“调查”的奸计真的实现了，则不仅可以借国际红十字会的说谎证明了“自然原因的瘟疫”或“共产党无力对付其控制下人民的健康”之类为“真实”，而且也就“调查”到了细菌武器的效果如何了。而如果奸计不得售呢，也依然不失其为抵赖罪行的一个藉口。但这些都并不“有趣”，“有趣”的是他的奸计终于卖不到一个钱，也依然不能作为抵赖的藉口。
    但现在又怎样呢？不过心没有死，还想继续已经破产的阴谋而已；而其实，除此以外也没有更好的法宝了。然而现在却是更处于被迫的状态，因此也非嚷得更响不可。事实上，苏联代表马立克已经揿住了美国的咽喉；因此，它不大嚷，就可能被揿死。这就是出席联合国裁减军备委员会会议的美国代表柯亨所以在纽约虚张声势地咆哮，而联合国秘书长赖伊也在焦急着的缘故。
    马立克正面提出问题，确实使美国强盗心焦的。马立克宣告：“我以非常重视这个问题的心情向美国代表和委员会提出下列问题：‘既然裁减军备委员会不能避而不问军备方面最实际的问题，那么对于像美国军队在朝鲜和中国使用大批屠杀平民的细菌武器这样一些最近发生的事情，也就不能置之不理。难道裁减军备委员会不应该因此立即考虑关于违犯细菌战——与正直人的良心、文明人民的良心不相容的十分可耻的战争——禁令的问题，使今后不得使用细菌武器，并使违犯细菌战禁令者受到审判么？’”
    美国的惊惶失措，当场就由美国代表团表现出来了。
    但美国代表团当场不能回答这个问题，而其代表之一柯亨却在第二天（三月十五日）的记者招待会上和十九日的裁减军备委员会例会上，以一大堆诬蔑苏联的谎话来代替回答。在十五日记者招待会上，柯亨说：“马立克没有要求进行调查，但是一般地要求斥责美国并宣布这种武器为非法。”“美国已经请求红十字国际委员会进行一次彻底的实地调查。”“美国要坚持要求进行一次调查，不管苏联合作与否。”……总之，就是“调查”，“调查”，除此之外再也没有旁的依靠了。
    这确实有些被迫得手足无措，而不得不语无伦次，但在语无伦次的抵赖中，也仍然露出了真实。例如这个美国代表责备马立克“一般地宣布这种武器为非法”，那就是说，美国至少也一般地承认这种武器为合法了。那么，“调查”，“调查”，究竟还要搞什么，又能搞什么呢？
    谁都知道美国强盗们就是要如此叫嚷，也只能如此叫嚷。真的，除了如此叫嚷，又能做什么呢？一切都尽于这里了，接下去就是完全的失败。不是有过一个关于魔鬼的最后如何收场的故事么。这是大概所有民族都曾经大同小异地流传过的：魔鬼立意要谋害正直的渔夫和他的美丽的女儿，因为渔夫家里有一颗明珠，这是渔夫为了他心爱的女儿从海里采来的。魔鬼认为那明珠对它大不利，因为在晚上，明珠安放在渔夫女儿枕边，发出明亮的光，照耀着渔夫的小屋，使魔鬼害怕。可是，魔鬼每次走近小屋去，都被那明亮的光吓得退回来了，终于达不到杀害渔夫父女和偷窃明珠的目的。后来，它就垂头丧气地去求助于它所姘识的一个巫婆，想靠巫婆的巫术去达到它的目的；但巫婆也害怕那光亮，不敢走近去，只是远远地站着咀咒，结果也徒劳。最后，魔鬼和巫婆都因为失败而害羞，投海死掉了。
    确实是优美的故事！
    但对于美国，魔鬼应换为死神或瘟魔，才更切合于杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流的职业。同时，美国强盗也除非被打死，决不会因害羞而投海的。除此两点，其它就都很符合美国现在的情景，因为使它害怕的罪证，是像渔夫的明珠那么明白得无法消灭的，而况渔夫的明珠也确切地象征了中朝两国和全世界人民的愤怒和由愤怒所表现出来的力量，使艾奇逊之流手足无措，于是它只好请巫婆也来帮忙，一同咀咒。
    柯亨自然不是扮的巫婆的角色。他是艾奇逊的直属的小魔卒。柯亨的张牙舞爪、虚张声势的“幽默感”，在于他的谎话的反面就是真实，而他又恰恰表现了美国的慌张。
    但所谓国际红十字会和联合国秘书长赖伊，可就正是艾奇逊们所姘识的巫婆了。艾奇逊说：“我们已经请求红十字国际委员会进行公正的现场调查，而国际红十字会已经答应。”这是颇为“幽默”的。但最为“幽默”的，还是菲律宾的“马尼拉时报”，它说：“红十字国际委员会可能是世界上唯一完全无偏无党的组织”。听到过没有？和魔鬼姘识的巫婆在替魔鬼出售奸计，却说是“无偏无党”，而且“完全”、“唯一”！
    赖伊说：“马立克提出美国军队在朝鲜进行细菌战的指责都是假的。只有苏联和中朝方面允许调查团入境，到现场去调查这种指责的真实性，那才能最好地表明指责人的诚意。”赖伊的“幽默”也就在于他做巫婆做得很好。
    艾奇逊们就是这样地在和巫婆演着接近末场的丑剧。失败是当然的，因为这合谋的奸计是无法售卖得出去的。
    虽然美国的反动科学都在堕落到制造集体杀人武器，而像哥伦比亚大学的教授罗兹伯里之类还在宣传细菌武器之后又宣传这样的死亡“福音”：“人轻松地死或痛苦地死，有什么区别呢？他同样都要死，到头不过是尸体。”但是，到失败的时候不是连魔鬼也都要投海么？而且，究竟由不得美国强盗要怎么样就怎么样的！
    我们很明白，从强盗那里是得不到正直的，只有捉住他，打死他！从死神那里也同样求不到人道和生存，也只有捉住它，绞死它！为了不使人类所不容的魔鬼们漏网，只有进行一切的斗争；而世界人民的力量已经使这些强盗和魔鬼离受审判的日子不远了。
