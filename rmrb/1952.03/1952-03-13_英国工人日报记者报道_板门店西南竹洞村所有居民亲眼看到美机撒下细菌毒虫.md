Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: A dispatch from Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British "Daily Worker," from the front lines of the germ warfare, dated the 10th: As I write this dispatch, I am in Jukdong Village (phonetic), which was attacked by American bacteriological weapons yesterday. This small village is located five miles southwest of Panmunjom and is divided into two sections. The smaller section has only five families, and the attack occurred near this section. According to local farmers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the situation was as follows: At approximately 10:50 AM on the 9th, an American B-26 plane flew over at low altitude, only 200 meters above the ground. The plane flew so low that the Chinese People's Volunteers thought it had been hit, so they sent seven people to investigate. On a section of road near this village, they suddenly encountered a large number of flies, mosquitoes, and small insects that villagers call "Yanglazi" (phonetic) – I still don't know the English name of this insect. All the Volunteer soldiers have been discussing germ warfare recently, and they already know what this is about. After posting sentries, they immediately went back to report. The Volunteer soldiers and the residents of this small village, which is frequently shelled, quickly took action to exterminate these poisonous insects. At 12:35 PM, a reconnaissance plane flew over, and two minutes later, the plane returned to scout the area.

All the villagers said they saw the plane and the poisonous insects. There is no doubt that the American B-26 plane dropped a large number of poisonous insects at this location.

    英国工人日报记者报道
    板门店西南竹洞村所有居民亲眼看到美机撒下细菌毒虫
    【新华社十二日讯】英国伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿十日自细菌战前线报道：记者写这篇通讯时，身在昨天遭受美国细菌武器袭击的竹洞（译音）村。这个小村子位于板门店西南五英里，村子分成两区，较小的一区只有五家人家，这次袭击就发生在这一区附近。据当地农民和中国人民志愿军的战士说，情况是这样的：九日上午十时五十分左右，一架美国B—二十六式飞机低飞而过，离地面只有二百公尺。飞机飞得这样低，中国人民志愿军战士以为这架飞机已被击中，就派七个人前往调查。在这个村庄附近的一段道路上，他们突然遇见大量苍蝇、蚊子和一种被村民称为“洋蝲子”（译音）的小虫——这种小虫的英文名字我到现在还不知道。所有志愿军战士最近一直在讨论细菌战，他们已知道这是怎么一回事。他们派人站岗以后，立即回去报告。志愿军战士和这个经常受到炮轰的小村的居民迅速采取行动，扑灭这些毒虫。十二时三十五分，有一架侦察机飞过，两分钟以后，这架飞机又飞回来侦察这个地区。
    所有村民都说他们看到飞机和毒虫。毫无疑问，那架美国B—二十六式飞机在这个地点投下了大量毒虫。
