    Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: Under the manipulation of the Menzies group, the Australian Federal Parliament's Senate, following the House of Representatives, passed the Menzies government's ratification of the US-made "peace treaty" with Japan on the 5th. The Menzies government's shameless measure to ratify this "treaty" has aroused strong opposition from the Australian people. According to a Teletype News Agency report from Melbourne on the 10th, the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Australian Communist Party issued a statement saying that the Menzies government's hasty ratification of the "peace treaty" with Japan "shows its complete submission to the orders of Wall Street and US imperialism. From whatever angle, the 'peace treaty' with Japan, which Wall Street forces upon the people, can only lead to new wars." The statement emphasized that the proposed so-called Pacific Pact "binds Australia to new military adventures that Wall Street and its plutocratic allies in Asia and the Pacific may undertake." The statement also said that the Australian Communist Party, the Labor Party, as well as members of the Liberal Party and the Country Party, trade union activists, and citizen representatives, all oppose the rearmament of Japan. This fact shows that the actions taken by the Menzies government are contrary to the wishes and vital interests of the Australian people.
    Labor Senator Cameron published an article in the current issue of the Labor Party's official organ, "Labor Voice," denouncing the rearmament of Japan. Cameron pointed out that the reason Menzies and his servants are now demanding immediate action to abandon the most important clauses of the Potsdam Proclamation is because American big bankers, big businessmen, and arms companies, through US State Department advisor Dulles, who recently came to Australia to meet with Prime Minister Menzies, gave them orders.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: TASS Tokyo, March 12th: According to the newspaper "Metal Worker," a congress was recently held in Tokyo under the auspices of the Japan Farmers' Association, attended by more than two hundred representatives from various prefectures. The congress demanded the abandonment of the plan to rearm Japan, opposed the confiscation of farmers' fields for military use, and opposed exorbitant taxes and levies and the anti-people policies of the Shigeru Yoshida Cabinet.
    The congress emphasized that the alliance of workers and peasants, who constitute the overwhelming majority of the Japanese people, must be the main force in the national liberation struggle.

    澳共抗议澳议会批准对日“和约”
    日本农民代表大会反对重新武装日本
    【新华社十三日讯】在孟席斯集团的操纵下，澳大利亚联邦议会参院已继众院之后在五日通过了孟席斯政府的批准美制对日和约案。孟席斯政府批准这一“和约”的无耻措施，激起澳大利亚人民的强烈反对。据电通社墨尔本十日讯：澳大利亚共产党中央委员会书记处发表声明说：孟席斯政府急忙批准对日“和约”，“是表示它完全屈服于华尔街和美帝国主义的命令。不管从什么角度来看，华尔街强使人民接受的对日‘和约’，只能导致新的战争”。声明着重指出：拟议中的所谓太平洋公约，“把澳大利亚束缚在华尔街和它在亚洲及太平洋的财阀盟友可能进行的新的军事冒险上”。声明又说：澳大利亚共产党、工党、以及自由党和乡村党的党员、工会运动者和公民代表，都反对重新武装日本。这个事实表明，孟席斯政府所采取的行动是违反澳大利亚人民的愿望和切身利益的。
    工党参议员开麦隆在本期的工党官方机关报“劳工呼声报”发表文章，痛斥重新武装日本。开麦隆指出：孟席斯和他的仆从之所以在现在要求立即采取行动，废弃波茨坦公告中最重要的条款，是由于美国的大银行家、大企业家和军火公司，通过最近来澳大利亚会晤孟席斯总理的美国国务院顾问杜勒斯，向他们下了命令。
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社东京十二日讯：据报纸“金属劳动者”消息：在日本农民协会的赞助下，最近在东京举行了一次大会，参加大会的有来自各县的两百多名代表。大会要求放弃重新武装日本的计划，反对没收农民的田地作军事用途，反对苛捐杂税以及吉田茂内阁的反人民的政策。
    大会强调指出：在日本人民中占压倒多数的工人和农民的联盟，一定是民族解放斗争中的主要力量。新华社更正
