Xinhua News Agency, March 19th dispatch: TASS, Moscow, March 18th: Prominent Soviet medical scientists gathered at the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences on the 17th to protest the crime of US imperialism in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.

Academician Anichkov, President of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, delivered the opening speech, demanding condemnation of the American savages and their henchmen, who are scholars in name only, as despicable and shameless.

Professor Dimakov, a Stalin Prize laureate, then spoke. He said: Soviet microbiologists study microorganisms for the purpose of manufacturing preventive and therapeutic medicines to prevent infectious diseases; while American microbiologists study microorganisms in order to strengthen their disease-causing properties, so as to use them to slaughter people. After the US and British imperialists have done such things, they still try to promote their way of life, their "science" and "culture." The warmongers did not hesitate to invite war criminals like Shiro Ishii to their laboratories. This is a low-down act, a moral degradation. However, no matter how rampant US imperialism is, no matter what methods of destroying mankind they invent, they cannot crush the indomitable spirit of freedom-loving people. Let them remember that they cannot escape responsibility for these crimes. The famous Soviet microbiologist Zdrodovsky delivered a speech. He said: No honest person can be indifferent to the atrocities of the American imperialists. We - Soviet scientists - will join all good people in raising our voices in anger to protest the use of bacteria as weapons to massively slaughter people.

The famous pediatrician Professor Spiransky and Professors Sergeyev, Molchanova, Letavetit, Betrischeva and other Soviet medical scientists also delivered speeches.

The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution, which stated: "We - Soviet medical scientists - cannot tolerate the use of medical and biological achievements to harm mankind. We demand an immediate end to the manufacture and use of bacteriological, chemical and other weapons of mass slaughter of people. We demand the punishment of those who advocate the manufacture of such weapons and those who permit the manufacture and use of these weapons. We believe that the World Peace Council will take the necessary measures to protect humanity from the threat of bacteriological warfare."

Xinhua News Agency, March 19th dispatch: TASS, Bucharest, March 18th: The Romanian working people, at countless mass rallies, unanimously protested the use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressors and demanded severe punishment for the bacteriological war criminals.

The Bucharest "Vulcan" Steel Factory held a rally on March 17. Keit, chairman of the factory's Peace Committee, said in his speech: "If the American aggressors think that the people will not punish their crimes, their assessment is completely wrong. We workers of the 'Vulcan' Steel Factory, together with the entire working people of Romania, demand the punishment of all those who deliberately exterminate civilians and commit heinous crimes."

Several thousand people participated in the rally at the Bucharest Central Railway Factory. Stakhanovite worker Ruplesko said at the rally: The new "allies" of the American aggressors - plague, cholera and typhoid - can never help the imperialists destroy the will of the Korean people; on the contrary, they will ignite the hatred of all mankind for the shameless American aggressors.

At all the rallies, the Romanian working people unanimously adopted resolutions condemning the shameless crimes of the American cannibals in conducting bacteriological warfare, and demanding severe punishment for the bacteriological war criminals who spread death.

Xinhua News Agency, March 19th dispatch: People in various European capitalist countries are filled with anger and have protested the crime of American aggressors in conducting bacteriological warfare.

In Italy, according to a report in "Unità" on the 12th: Anti-US bacteriological warfare protest movements have been widely launched throughout Italy. In Vignola, a village in the province of Modena, the masses held an angry demonstration. The police intervened barbarously, but were unable to stop the demonstration. In Spilamberto, in the Emilia region, people held a demonstration, and workers in many factories went on strike. Even merchants closed their shops and markets during the demonstration. In Milan, Bologna and Reggio Emilia in Emilia, many factories passed protest letters, and workers in some factories held protest strikes.

The Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party passed a resolution at its meeting on March 15 and 16, strongly protesting the towering crime of US imperialism in using bacteriological weapons. The resolution calls on all honest people to severely condemn the use of bacteriological weapons and to stop those who do not hesitate to use criminal methods of warfare.

The municipal council of Cannes, a famous seaside resort in France, unanimously passed a resolution on the 17th, strongly condemning the United States for using bacteriological weapons in Korea. The municipal council's protest resolution has been sent to the United Nations.

In the Netherlands, eighty unemployed workers in Amsterdam sent a telegram to the United Nations, protesting the bacteriological warfare carried out by the American aggressors and demanding the punishment of the criminals who launched the bacteriological warfare.

Finnish democratic public opinion expressed indignation at the crime of American aggressors using bacteriological weapons. "Worker's News" said: The towering crime of the American imperialists has aroused the anger of the people of all countries around the world. The Finnish people, together with the people of the world, resolutely protest the new crime of the American imperialists that violates the principles of international law and humanitarian principles. "Free Talk" newspaper emphasized: The American imperialists have been preparing for bacteriological warfare for a long time. The newspaper pointed out: Both the United States and Japan have refused to sign the Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological warfare. The United States has placed Japanese war criminals - bacteriological warfare experts - under its protection. Some military and political leaders in the United States have repeatedly and openly attempted to defend bacteriological warfare as justified. The newspaper concluded: All peace-loving humanity, every honest person, must loudly protest the crimes of American imperialism.

[This newspaper's report] According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Dutch Communist Party's organ, "De Waarheid," published all the facts that have been revealed about the US conducting bacteriological warfare. The newspaper called on the Dutch people to protest and condemn this atrocity by the United States that violates all humanitarian principles. Sandtun, a member of the Dutch Communist Party in the Upper House of the Dutch Parliament, spoke in the Dutch Parliament condemning the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea by American aggressors. He also expressed a firm protest against the Dutch army's participation in the barbaric war against the Korean people. He demanded the immediate withdrawal of the Dutch battalion from Korea. In Amsterdam, many sanitation workers (including drivers) sent a telegram to the US Embassy protesting the US bacteriological warfare in Korea.

In Switzerland, "Swiss Worker's News" said: The evidence presented by the Korean and Chinese sides regarding the United States' use of bacteriological weapons is irrefutable. The newspaper emphasized: This crime of the United States has strengthened the determination of the people of the world to carry out a strong struggle to end aggression and strive for lasting peace.

    斯大林奖金得奖人狄马科夫教授接着发言。他说：苏联微生物学家研究微生物的目的是制造预防性与治疗性的药品，以便防止发生传染病；而美国微生物学家研究微生物是为了加强微生物的传病性能，以便利用它们屠杀人民。美、英帝国主义者做出了这样的事以后，还企图宣传他们的生活方式，他们的“科学”和“文化”。战争贩子们毫不迟疑地把像石井四郎这样的战犯请到他们的实验室里去。这是下流行径，这是道德的沦丧。但是，无论美帝国主义多么猖狂，无论他们发明什么样的毁灭人类的方法，他们也粉碎不了爱好自由的人民的坚贞不屈精神。让他们记住，他们是逃不脱这些罪行的责任的。苏联著名微生物学家兹德罗多夫斯基发表演说。他说：任何正直的人都不能对于美帝国主义者的暴行无动于衷。我们——苏联科学家，将和一切善良的人一起发出愤怒的呼声，抗议把细菌作为武器来大规模屠杀人民。

    好几千人参加了布加勒斯特中央铁路工厂的大会。斯塔哈诺夫式工作者鲁泼莱斯柯在大会上说：美国侵略者的新“盟友”——鼠疫、霍乱和伤寒，决不可能帮助帝国主义者摧毁朝鲜人民的意志；相反的，它们将燃起整个人类对无耻的美国侵略者的仇恨。
    在所有的集会上，罗马尼亚劳动人民一致通过决议，谴责美国吃人生番进行细菌战的无耻罪行，并要求严厉惩办散布死亡的细菌战犯。
