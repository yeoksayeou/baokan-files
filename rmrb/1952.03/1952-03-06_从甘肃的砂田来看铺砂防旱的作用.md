    From Gansu's Sand Fields: The Role of Sand Mulching in Drought Resistance
    Sheng Jialian
    Central Gansu Province is cold and arid, with an average annual rainfall of less than 300 millimeters, and the total rainfall in March, April, and May each year is less than 50 millimeters. The terrain is mostly mountainous and gully-ridden, and rainwater severely erodes the soil. Farmers planting crops often experience nine years of crop failure out of ten, leading to a sparsely populated area with difficult living conditions. During the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty, Yongdeng County in Gaolan experienced consecutive years of severe drought, and all the dryland on the hillsides yielded nothing. Most farmers were displaced and unable to survive. At that time, an old farmer, while gathering leaves and digging up grass roots, discovered a pile of sand and gravel on a hillside that had been dug out by ground squirrels when they were burrowing. Several wheat plants with plump ears and grains were growing on top of that pile of sand. He realized that gravel had a drought-resistant function, so he studied it and created a method of sand mulching for drought prevention. He dug up a large pile of gravel from the mountains and spread it evenly on the prepared land, applied fertilizer, and sowed seeds, resulting in a bumper harvest. Later, after imitation and promotion by nearby farmers, that area formed a sand field cultivation method for water conservation and drought resistance that has lasted for hundreds of years.
    Yield and Quality of Crops in Sand Fields
    In arid areas, sand field cultivation can not only increase yield but also stabilize harvests. Before liberation, degraded cotton was generally planted in sand fields, yielding more than 100 jin per mu, which was three times more than dryland (watered land in that area only grew plants and did not produce bolls). Wheat was also commonly grown in sand fields, yielding about 150 jin per mu, which was twice as much as dryland. Compared with watered land, although the yield was not high, the quality was much better (according to rough tests, sand field wheat had 30% more gluten than watered land wheat). Sand fields near cities can also grow lettuce, watermelon, cantaloupe, etc., and the quality is better than that of watered and dry land, and they mature earlier.
    Why Sand Fields Can Resist Drought and Increase Yield
    Why can sand fields resist drought, increase yield, and stabilize harvests? There are several reasons that are currently understood:
    1. Sand can conserve water. After autumn plowing, the dry land is covered with gravel, and the capillary action of the soil (the action of small holes absorbing water and rising) is interrupted by the gravel cover, reducing soil moisture evaporation. This principle is the same as covering the land with grass or other coverings. At the same time, rainwater can seep into the soil layer through the sand particles, and there is less runoff.
    2. Sand can insulate. The temperature of the sand fields and the ground temperature rise and fall slowly during the crop growing season. The temperature in the dryland changes drastically due to the northwest’s saying "wear fur coats in the morning and shirts at noon." In many measurements, the dryland temperature only exceeded the sand field temperature by one to three degrees Celsius at 2:00 PM every day, but was one or two degrees lower at other times; especially around 4:00 AM, the temperature difference between the two was four or five degrees. In such a hot and cold environment, the growth of plants is of course difficult to be normal. In spring, the temperature of the dryland often drops below the minimum temperature required for plants, and growth is naturally more affected. In the northwest of Gansu, cotton in watered fields only produces bolls but does not produce lint because the early growth is slow, and even if it flourishes in summer, it is still too late to produce lint before the frost.
    3. Sand can reduce the harm of salt and alkali to crops. I have not conducted detailed measurements on this issue. However, after covering light alkaline land in the northwest with sand, the seedling survival rate of crops increased, and the growth was also stronger. After observing the underground profile six months after the sand was laid, the salt and alkali layer under the sand field was significantly lower than that of the water and dry land. The general farmers' view that "sand suppresses alkali" is reasonable. Salt and alkali are related to soil moisture. If the water rises less and slower, the salt and alkali will not easily rise, and the impact on plant growth will be reduced.
    The above three reasons interact with each other, enabling young crops in spring drought areas to overcome the various difficulties given by the environment in the early stage of growth, allowing crops to grow naturally; during the peak growing season of crops, due to the stable rise in temperature and the timely supply of water, the crops can bloom and bear fruit normally, and mature completely.
    How to Lay Sand
    Laying sand is relatively labor-intensive; however, on dry land, laying sand can make crops abundant, so it is worth promoting in dry areas with sand-laying conditions. Northwest farmers always lay sand after autumn when they are not busy with farming. First, deeply plow and level the land, spread more than an inch of manure, and then transport the gravel to the field, arrange it into small piles of sand, and determine the thickness of the sand layer according to the different crops to be planted, and rake the piles of sand flat. In order to interrupt the capillary action of the soil, the gravel must be mixed with less soil. Therefore, when managing sand fields, one must always pay attention to preventing the soil under the sand from mixing with the sand on the soil. It is naturally difficult to completely prevent the sand and soil from mixing; however, the possibility of mixing must be minimized. Therefore, farmers often lightly press the land with a roller before laying sand. There are two types of gravel used in sand fields: fine sand and coarse sand. Fine sand is as small as millet grains and as large as soybeans. Coarse sand is generally the size of eggs, and there are also flat stone flakes of equal size. When laying sand, fine sand accounts for 30% and coarse sand accounts for 70%. The thickness of the sand is usually three or four inches, and rarely exceeds half a foot.
    Sand Field Cultivation Methods
    After laying the sand, plow it once before planting in the spring. There is no need to remove the gravel when plowing. The local area often uses a farm tool for plowing, the structure of which is the same as that of a double-legged seed drill. The drill feet are fitted with two small plows with blunt tips, which are somewhat similar to the plows commonly used in Hebei Province. One animal is used to pull it, and the two plows are inserted into the gravel like a plow plowing in the soil. The depth of plowing only requires the plow tip to break the soil surface under the sand layer. The function is only to loosen the sand layer, and the effect is completely the same as that of intertillage. When plowing, the plow blade must not be perpendicular to the sand surface, otherwise the plowing will be laborious, the plow tip will easily break, and the soil under the sand will also be mixed with the gravel. Like watered and dry land, base fertilizer must be applied before planting. In wheat fields, a flat rake is used to open ditches in the sandy land, and fertilizer is applied at the bottom of the ditch (the amount of fertilizer is the same as that of dry land), and then covered with gravel; when planting wheat, it is sown in strips with a seed drill. Cotton, watermelon, etc. are planted by dibbling. First, use a melon shovel to open the sandy land according to the row and plant spacing, forming many rectangular holes about one foot long and six inches wide, exposing the original dry land surface. Apply base fertilizer at the rear end of the hole, cover it with a thin layer of soil and compact it. Most of the fertilizers used are fine fertilizers such as hemp dregs and bean cakes. Sow seeds at the front end of the hole, cover them with a thin layer of soil, and then cover them with a thin layer of fine sand. Cover the seeds with a large piece of gravel. After germination, remove the large stone and gradually use gravel to protect the seedlings. After thinning, completely cover the excavated gravel like hilling soil. During the crop growing season, intertillage is also carried out in the same way as described above. When planting vegetables, hand hoes such as melon shovels are used once or twice. Weeding is done by hand. Other management methods are the same as those for dryland cultivation. New sand fields are good, because the degree of mixing of sand and soil is generally shallow; old ones are not good, because the degree of mixing of sand and soil is deep due to the long years of cultivation or poor cultivation techniques.
    General sand fields can maintain a bumper harvest for 30 years, and some areas can use them for 60 to 70 years, depending on the degree of mixing of soil and sand. Some newly laid sand fields become old sand fields immediately after being flooded by mountain gullies carrying mud and sand, filling the gravel with mud, and lose their effectiveness in water conservation and high yield. When sand fields are too old, the old sand must be removed and new sand must be laid.
    The above is the situation of sand mulching on dry land. In some places, watered land can also be covered with sand in order to save water. Irrigation can still be carried out after sand mulching, but it must be done with clear water containing less mud and sand. The sand in watered fields generally needs to be replaced every five or six years.
    The method of sand mulching has expanded the cultivated area in the northwest and increased the yield per unit area. This is a brilliant creation of our working farmers in their struggle with nature. This proves that in the movement to prevent and fight drought, we can and must rely on the masses, give full play to the wisdom and creativity of the masses, create more methods to prevent and fight drought and increase production, and overcome natural disasters.

    This is a sand field near Lanzhou, on the right bank of the Yellow River. This land is very close to the river, but it is less economical to divert water for irrigation than to cultivate with sand mulching. The large watermelon held by this old farmer is a product of this sand field.

    从甘肃的砂田来看铺砂防旱的作用
    盛家廉
    甘肃省中部，寒冷干旱，平均年雨量在三百公厘以下，每年三、四、五月的总雨量不到五十公厘。地形又多山岗沟壑，雨水对土壤的冲刷很剧烈。农民种植作物，十年九不收，形成了地广人稀、生活困苦的景象。清朝嘉庆年间，皋兰永登地区连年奇旱，所有山坡旱地，颗粒不收。农民大多流离失所，无法生存。当时有一位老农，在采树叶、刨草根时，在山坡上发现了一堆地鼠打洞时扒出来的砂砾，那砂堆上面却长着几株穗粒壮实的小麦。他由此体会到砂砾有防旱的功能，就加以研究，创造出铺砂防旱的方法来。他从山地里挖出了一大堆砂砾，平铺在整好的土地上，施肥播种，结果得到了丰收。后来经过附近农民的仿效推广，那一带地区就形成了几百年来砂田栽培保水抗旱的耕作方法。
    砂田作物的产量和质量
    砂田栽培作物，在干旱地区，不但可以提高产量，还能稳定收成。解放前一般砂田种植退化棉，每亩可收一百多斤，比旱地多收三倍（那一带水地种棉花只长棵不开铃）；砂田种小麦，也很普遍，每亩可收一百五十斤左右，比旱地多收一倍；和水地比较，产量虽不高，但品质要好得多（砂田小麦比水地小麦的含面筋量，根据粗放试验测定，要多百分之三十）。城市附近的砂田还能种植莴苣、西瓜、甜瓜等等，质量都比水地旱地好，而且成熟得比较早。
    砂田为什么能抗旱和提高产量
    为什么砂田能抗旱和提高产量，稳定收成？目前所明白的有几种原因：
    1、砂能保水。干旱的土地经过秋耕，铺上砂砾，土壤的毛细管作用（小孔吸水上升的作用）因砂砾的覆盖而被隔断，减少了土壤水分的蒸发。这道理和土地盖草或加其他覆盖物相同。同时，雨水能由砂粒渗入土层，流失也少。
    2、砂能保温。砂田中的温度和地面温度在作物生长季节内升降缓和。旱地中的温度则因西北“早穿皮袄午穿衫”，气温变化剧烈，骤升骤降。在很多次的测定内，旱地温度只有在每天午后二时，比砂田的温度可能超过摄氏一到三度，其他时间反要低下一、二度；尤其在早晨四时前后，两者温差达四、五度。在这样忽冷忽热的环境中，植物的生长当然很难正常。春季旱地温度常降到植物必需的最低温度以下，生长自然更受影响。甘肃西北部水地棉花结桃不开铃，就是由于幼期生长缓慢，即使到夏季旺盛起来，还赶不及在霜前吐絮。
    3、砂可以减少盐碱对作物的侵害。这问题我没有举行过详细测定。但见西北轻碱地铺砂后，作物保苗率提高，生长也强。经铺砂半年后由地下剖面观察，砂田下盐碱层显著比水旱地的为低。一般农民认为“砂压碱”，是有道理的。盐碱和土壤水分是相关联的。水分上升少而慢，盐碱也就不易起来，植物生长所受影响也就减低了。
    上面所谈的三个原因相互起作用，能使春旱地带幼年作物克服生长初期环境所给予的各种困难，让作物自然生长；在作物生长盛期，也由于温度的平稳上升，水分的及时供应，使作物正常地开花结实，完满地成熟。
    怎样铺砂
    铺砂比较费工；可是在干旱的土地上一经铺砂，就能使作物丰产，因此，在有铺砂条件的干旱地区，还是值得提倡的。西北农民铺砂总是在秋后农闲时进行。先把土地深耕整平，铺上一寸多厩肥，然后把砂砾运到田间，排列成小砂堆，按照种植作物的不同，决定砂层厚薄，把砂堆耙平。为了隔断土壤的毛细管作用，必须使砂砾少掺土壤。所以经营砂田必须时刻注意，严防砂下的土和土上的砂掺混起来。砂和土绝对不掺混自然很难办到；但必须使掺混的可能减至最低限度。因此，农民们在铺砂以前常把土地用滚轴轻压一道。砂田所用的砂砾有两种，一种是细砂，一种是粗砂。细砂小的如小米粒，大的如黄豆，粗砂一般有鸡蛋大小，也有大小相等的扁平石片。铺砂时，细砂占十分之三，粗砂占十分之七。铺砂的厚度，普通三四寸，很少超过半尺厚的。
    砂田耕种方法
    铺完了砂，在春天种植前，要先耕一遍。耕时不必把砂石起掉。耕地时当地常用一种农具，构造和双腿耧相同，耧脚上套装两个尖端较钝的小铧，和河北省普通用的耠子有些相像，用一个牲口拉，两个铧光插在砂砾内和耠子耕在土地内一般。耕的深度，只求铧尖触破砂层下的土面就可，功用只在松动砂层，作用完全和中耕相同。耕时耠铧不能和砂面垂直，否则耕动费力，铧尖容易折断，砂下土壤也会和砂石掺混。种植前也像水地旱地，先要施基肥。在麦地用平板耙把砂地开沟，在沟底施肥（施肥量和旱地相同），然后盖上砂砾；种麦时再用种耧条播下去。种棉花西瓜等都采用点播法，先把砂地用瓜铲按照行株距离把砂砾扒开，形成许多长一尺许宽六寸的长方穴，露出原来旱地地面，在穴的后端施下基肥，上盖薄土压实。肥料多用麻渣、豆饼等细肥；穴先端播下种籽，上面也薄盖泥土，而后薄盖细沙一层。种籽上再盖一块大砂石。发芽后就把大石取去，逐渐用砂砾围护幼苗，间苗后把扒出的砂砾像培土似地完全重新盖上。作物生长期内，也行中耕，方法同上面所谈的一般。种植蔬菜时有用瓜铲等手锄一二遍的。除草用手拔。其他管理方法和旱地栽培相同。砂田新的好，因为新的一般是砂和土混合的程度浅；老的不好，因为耕作的年代久了，或耕种技术不高，砂与土掺混的程度深了。
    一般的砂田可以维持三十年的丰收，有些地区可以用到六七十年，要看土和砂掺混的程度而定。有些新铺的砂田因为被山沟的洪水带了泥沙漫过一次，砂砾中填满了泥土，立时变成老砂田，就失去保水丰产的效用。砂田太老了的时候必须起去旧砂改铺新砂。
    以上是旱地铺砂的情况。有些地方水浇地也可以铺砂，为的是节省用水。铺砂后仍可灌溉，但必须用含泥沙少的清水。水浇地的砂一般都要在五、六年后改换一次。
    铺砂的办法扩大了西北耕地面积，也提高了单位面积产量。这是我国劳动农民和自然作斗争的一种光辉的创造。由此可以证明，我们在防旱抗旱运动中，可能而且必须依靠群众，发挥群众的智慧和创造性，创造更多的防旱抗旱增加生产的方法，战胜自然灾害。（附图片）
    这是兰州附近的一块砂田，在黄河的右岸。这片地离河很近，但引水灌田反不如铺砂耕种经济。这位老农抱的大西瓜就是这块砂田上的产品。
