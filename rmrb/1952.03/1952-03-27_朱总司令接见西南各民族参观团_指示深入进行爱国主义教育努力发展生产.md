Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: Commander-in-Chief Zhu De received the entire visiting group of national minorities from Southwest China on the 25th. In his speech, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De welcomed the visiting group to Beijing and gave a brief instruction on patriotism and the development of minority nationalities. He said: Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, our motherland is great, and our country is a large family of fraternal and mutually assisting nationalities. Our people, regardless of nationality or region, have a bright future.

Commander-in-Chief Zhu De emphasized: The imperialists do not want us to have this future. In addition to attempting to conquer us by force, they also secretly send spies and special agents, colluding with the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, infiltrating our border areas and inland, and carrying out sabotage activities. We must be vigilant about this situation. We must universally and deeply carry out patriotic education in all minority areas, expose the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism, and universally establish the concepts of national unity, love for the motherland, and opposition to imperialism in the minds of all minority people. All minority people must understand that resolutely struggling against all destructive activities of imperialism is a necessary condition for people of all nationalities to build a happy life and move towards a bright future.

Regarding the issue of building a happy life, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De pointed out: Developing production is the key for all minority nationalities to continue to move forward and gradually escape backwardness after achieving political equality. This is a long-term task that must be done step by step and diligently. At present, attention should be paid to developing agriculture, animal husbandry, and handicrafts in various minority areas. For production in minority areas to truly develop, appropriate social reforms are inevitable, and the material and technical assistance of the Han people, as well as the efforts of the minority nationalities themselves, are needed.

After seeing Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and hearing his cordial speech, all members of the visiting group of national minorities from Southwest China were extremely excited and decided to hold a discussion on Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's instructions.

    朱总司令接见西南各民族参观团
    指示深入进行爱国主义教育努力发展生产
    【新华社二十六日讯】朱德总司令在二十五日接见了西南各民族参观团的全体人员。朱德总司令在讲话中，对参观团来京表示欢迎，并就爱国主义和少数民族的发展问题作了扼要的指示。他说：在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，我们的祖国是伟大的，我们的国家是一个各民族友爱互助的大家庭，我们的人民不分民族和地区，都有光辉的前途。
    朱德总司令着重指出：帝国主义不愿意我们有这个前途，他们除了企图用武力征服我们以外，还秘密派遣间谍特务，与残余的蒋匪帮同谋，渗入到我们的边疆和内地，进行破坏活动。对于这种情况，我们必须警惕。我们要在一切少数民族地区普遍、深入地进行爱国主义教育，揭发帝国主义的阴谋诡计；在一切少数民族人民的思想中普遍树立民族团结、爱护祖国、反对帝国主义的观念，要各少数民族人民都了解：和帝国主义的一切破坏活动进行坚决的斗争，是各民族人民建设幸福生活、走向光辉前途的必要条件。
    关于建设幸福的生活问题，朱德总司令指出：发展生产，是各少数民族在得到政治上的平等以后，继续向前发展，使自己逐渐脱离落后境地关键。这是一个长期的任务，必须逐步地去做，必须努力地认真地去做。目前应注意发展各个少数民族地区的农业、牧畜业和手工业。各少数民族地区生产要真正发展，必不可免地要进行适当的社会改革，同时需要汉族人民物质和技术的帮助，和少数民族自己的努力。
    西南各民族参观团全体人员见到了朱德总司令并听到了朱德总司令亲切的讲话之后，都异常兴奋，并决定就朱德总司令的指示举行座谈。
