    Eradicate Fascist Germs
    Stalin Prize Winner Zhou Libo
    American imperialists, first in Korea, and then on the sacred territory of our motherland, have brutally and shamelessly spread germs, which fills us with indescribable indignation.
    This new, monstrous crime of Truman and Ridgway, these American pirates, proves once again that they are more ferocious man-eating beasts than Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo. In doing so, they are not only cruel, but also cowardly. They cannot defeat us in Korea with airplanes, artillery, and tanks, and vainly imagine that they can win with lice, fleas, and flies. However, this only proves once again that American imperialists themselves are as dirty as lice, as despicable as fleas, and as disgusting as flies.
    American imperialists dare to defy the world by using germs, because they themselves are germs in human form. People say that fascism is a germ, and that is exactly the case. Isn't America becoming more and more like fascist Germany and fascist Japan day by day?
    People all over the world are not only angry, but also more wide-eyed, seeing clearly the ugly faces of the American aggressors. The faces of Truman and his Wall Street bosses are even more obvious. From now on, painters will have to add new touches to their brand, and have to draw lice, fleas, or flies, because these are their essential characteristics.
    The desperately vicious American imperialists fully expect to scare us with germs, but the heroic people of China and Korea, who are not afraid of artillery, are definitely not afraid of flies. The angry roar demanding punishment for germ warfare criminals comes not only from all of China and Korea, but also from the powerful Soviet Union, and from all over the world. In the past, Japanese fascists also spread germs when they could not achieve victory, but where did the Japanese fascists go in the end?
    However, we must remember this blood debt. One day, we will try these conscience-lacking human vermin, just as the Soviet Union did in the Far East Tribunal!

    扑灭法西斯细菌
    斯大林奖金获得者　周立波
    美国帝国主义者先在朝鲜，后在我们祖国的神圣的领土上凶残无耻地撒布细菌，使我们感到无法形容的愤慨。
    杜鲁门、李奇微这些美国海盗们的这种新的滔天罪行，又一次地证明了他们是比希特勒、墨索里尼、东条还要凶残的吃人的野兽。他们这样作，不但是凶残，而且是怯懦，他们在朝鲜用飞机、大炮和坦克打不过我们，妄想靠虱子、跳蚤和苍蝇这些毒虫来取胜。然而，这不过是再度证明美国帝国主义者自己是跟虱子一样肮脏，跟跳蚤一样卑污，跟苍蝇一样可厌罢了。
    美国帝国主义者竟然冒天下之大不韪，使用细菌，是因为他们自己就是人形的细菌。人们说，法西斯主义就是细菌，事实正是这样子。美国不正是一天一天地变得和法西斯德国，法西斯日本毫无二致吗？
    全世界的人不但愤怒，而且更加睁大了眼睛，看清了美国侵略者的丑恶的嘴脸，杜鲁门和他的华尔街的老板们的脸谱更加明显了。从此，画家的笔下要添上新的笔触，除开?商标外，还得画上虱子，跳蚤，或者是苍蝇，因为这是他们的本质的特征。
    穷凶极恶的美国帝国主义者满想用细菌来吓唬我们一下子，但是，不怕大炮的中朝两国的英雄的人民，是决不怕苍蝇的。要求惩办细菌战犯的愤怒的吼声，不但来自全中国和朝鲜，而且来自强大的苏联，来自全世界。当年日本法西斯，当他们无法取得胜利时，也曾撒过细菌的，但是，曾几何时，日本法西斯滚到那里去了呢？
    然而这一笔血账，我们是要记住的。总有一天，我们要像苏联在远东法庭上一样，审判这些丧天昧良的人类的毒虫！
