    Eliminate Obstacles in the "Three-Anti" Campaign
    Guo Lanting's Serious Embezzlement Should Be Swiftly Dealt With by Relevant Leaders
    Editor: We are reporting the serious theft of state assets by Guo Lanting, member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Guantao County Committee and Director of the Organization Department, and others. In the autumn of 1950, Guo Lanting and County Head Liu Xiaobo illegally misappropriated 200,000 jin of public grain and 400,000 jin of seed cotton to invest in the private merchant "Xinghua Freight Forwarding"; in the same year, they illegally misappropriated 100,000 jin of local grain to help "Xinghua Freight Forwarding" establish the "Yuhua Processing Factory" and forcibly transferred 400,000 jin of seed cotton from the county cooperative processing factory to the "Yuhua Processing Factory", causing more than 100 workers in the cooperative (disaster victims working in exchange for relief) to lose their jobs. He supported private merchants in competing with the county cooperative for the purchase of seed cotton, disrupting finance; private merchants, relying on the name of "agency production," engaged in speculation and tax evasion, causing incalculable losses to state assets.
    More seriously, in 1949, he stole 2 million yuan of Party membership dues and invested it in Xinghua Freight Forwarding as his own "shares," and received dividends three times. Under Guo Lanting's lead, many cadres also invested in private merchants. Guo Lanting also arbitrarily used Party membership dues to buy a bicycle and a flashlight for his wife and sell cigarettes. Last year, he deliberately approved false reimbursements (false receipts) of 9.9 million yuan and approved false travel expenses of 300,000 yuan for four cadres.
    In the "Three-Anti" campaign, Guo Lanting resisted the movement, slandered good people, and protected accountant Wang Decheng, who had serious embezzlement problems, and sought revenge on comrades who reported him.
    The CPC Handan Prefectural Committee is aware of all of Guo Lanting's problems. Comrade Wang Yu, Director of the Cadre Department of the Organization Department of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee, also personally conducted an investigation, but no action has been taken to date. Guo Lanting is still a member of the County Thrift Examination Committee. We believe that Guo Lanting has become an agent of the bourgeoisie and an obstacle to the "Three-Anti" campaign. He is not qualified to lead the "Three-Anti" campaign.

    Editor's Note: The errors of Guo Lanting, member of the CPC Guantao County Committee and Director of the Organization Department, are extremely serious. It is wrong for the CPC Handan Prefectural Committee to know his crimes but not take action. The CPC Hebei Provincial Committee and the CPC Handan Prefectural Committee should immediately and seriously handle this matter and inform us of the results.

    清除“三反”运动中的障碍
    郭兰亭有严重贪污行为，有关领导方面应迅速处理
    编辑同志：我们检举中共馆陶县委员会委员兼组织部长郭兰亭等的严重盗窃国家资财的行为。一九五零年秋，郭兰亭和县长刘晓波非法挪用公粮二十万斤，籽棉四十万斤，向私商“兴华货栈”投资；同年，又非法挪用地方粮十万斤，帮助“兴华货栈”建立“裕华加工厂”，并强从县合作社加工厂调拨四十万斤籽棉，转给“裕华加工厂”，致使合作社百余工人（以工代赈的灾民）失业。他支持私商与县合作社争购籽棉，扰乱金融；私商倚仗“机关生产”名义，投机倒把，偷税漏税，使国家资财遭受了无法估计的损失。
    更严重的是，他在一九四九年曾窃取党费二百万元，投资于兴华货栈，作为自己的“股金”，先后分过三次红利。在郭兰亭的带头下，许多干部也向私商入股。郭兰亭还任意动用党费，给老婆买自行车，买手电筒，并贩卖纸烟。去年，他曾故意批准假报销（假单据）九百九十万，又批准四个干部假报路费三十万元。
    在“三反”运动中，郭兰亭抗拒运动，并诬赖好人，庇护有严重贪污问题的会计王德成，对检举他的同志则寻隙报复。
    郭兰亭所有的问题，中共邯郸地委是清楚的。中共河北省委组织部干部处长王玉同志还亲自作过调查，但至今没有处理。郭兰亭现在仍担任县节约检查委员会的委员。我们认为，郭兰亭已成为资产阶级的代理人，并且是“三反”运动中的障碍，他是不配领导“三反”运动的。

    编者按：中共馆陶县委员会委员、组织部长郭兰亭的错误是极严重的。中共邯郸地委知道他的罪情，但不加以处理，是错误的。中共河北省委和中共邯郸地委应即认真处理这件事情，并把处理结果告诉我们。
