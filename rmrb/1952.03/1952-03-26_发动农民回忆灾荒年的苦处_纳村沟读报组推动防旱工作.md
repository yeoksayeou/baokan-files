    Mobilizing Peasants to Recall the Bitterness of Famine Years
    Nacungou Reading Group Promotes Drought Prevention Work

    Editor: After studying the State Council's instructions on drought prevention and resistance, all eighteen members of the Nacungou reading group in Fengzhen County, Suiyuan Province, immediately held mass discussion meetings in separate areas, mobilizing the masses to recall the painful lives during the famine years, and promoting the masses to carry out drought prevention and resistance work. Poor peasant Li Yuanbao recalled the death of his parents from starvation in 1929 due to the famine; hired peasant Zhang Sandan recounted how, in 1937, due to the famine in his hometown (Datong), he gave away his own son to someone else while fleeing. These vivid facts moved everyone. Many peasants said, "In the past, no one cared if we starved to death during famines; now Chairman Mao is leading us, giving us loans to dig wells, how can we not work hard?" Now, more than 230 people in the village have participated in well-digging and drought prevention work. They automatically put forward the slogans "Strive for one well per household" and "Not relying on the heavens for food." After finishing the wells, the village also plans to repair a canal before sowing.

    发动农民回忆灾荒年的苦处
    纳村沟读报组推动防旱工作
    编辑同志：绥远丰镇县纳村沟读报组学习了政务院关于防旱、抗旱的指示后，全组十八个组员，立即分片召开群众座谈会，发动群众回忆灾荒年间的痛苦生活，推动群众进行防旱、抗旱工作。贫农李元保回忆了一九二九年因为灾荒饿死爹、妈的事情；雇农张三旦诉说了一九三七年因老家（大同）发生灾荒，在逃难路上把亲生儿子送给人家的事情。这些活生生的事实，感动了大家。许多农民都说：“过去闹灾荒，饿死也没有人管；现在毛主席来领导，给咱贷款打井，怎能不好好干呢？”现在该村已有二百三十多人参加了打井防旱工作。他们自动提出了“争取一户打一眼井”、“不靠天吃饭”的口号。打完井以后，该村还准备在播种前抢修一条水渠。    秋涛
