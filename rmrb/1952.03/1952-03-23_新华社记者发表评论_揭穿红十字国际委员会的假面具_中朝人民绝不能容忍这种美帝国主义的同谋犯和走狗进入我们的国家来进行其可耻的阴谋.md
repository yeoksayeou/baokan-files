Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd - A Xinhua News Agency reporter published the following commentary regarding the American aggressors' request for the "International Committee of the Red Cross" to investigate our side's condemnation of the United States' germ warfare:

    U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, eager to find a good hiding place to escape the worldwide people's unanimous anger and condemnation of the American aggressors' germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China, issued a statement on March 4th, denying their monstrous crimes, and declared that he "welcomes a fair investigation by international organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross." On March 11th, Acheson telegraphed the International Committee of the Red Cross again, designating the committee as an "impartial international organization" to conduct an investigation on "both sides of the Korean front" regarding germ warfare, and affirmed that the committee "will provide evidence to prove the falsity of the accusations regarding germ warfare." On March 19th, the U.S. representative to the United Nations Disarmament Commission, Cohen, also suggested that this International Committee of the Red Cross should investigate our side's condemnation of the U.S. military's germ warfare.

    Seeing these actions of the United States, one cannot help but wonder why the American imperialists are so fond of and trust the International Committee of the Red Cross, praising its "impartiality" and entrusting this organization to investigate their bloody crimes. But as long as we look at the shameless collusion of this so-called "impartial" organization of the American imperialists in the Korean War, turning a blind eye to the side of the American aggressors, we will know that this organization, which bears the banner of the Red Cross but actually serves the American imperialists, has long gained the favor of American imperialism with its record of betraying the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war, which it regards as a classic, and supporting the atrocities of the American aggressor forces.

    Everyone knows that since the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, the International Committee of the Red Cross has been serving the American aggressor forces in South Korea in the name of implementing the Geneva Convention. However, the American aggressors have come up with all kinds of brutal ways to insult, abuse, and slaughter our captured personnel in the handling of our captured personnel, who should have been treated in the exact opposite way in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Articles 3 and 13 of the Geneva Convention stipulate that prisoners of war should be protected from abuse, threats, insults, or damage to their bodies. However, the American aggressors, in order to detain our captured personnel, carried out deliberate insult actions of so-called "screening" and "interrogation" of our captured personnel, and sent a large number of Chiang Kai-shek and Li Cheng-wan bandit gang agents to forcibly tattoo the extremely insulting words "Anti-Communist and Anti-Russian" on the arms of the captured personnel and forced them to write blood letters. Afterwards, the American officers in charge of the prisoners of war openly came forward to threaten these people who had already been damaged in body and insulted, saying that if they returned to our side, "they would only have a dead end." Article 13 of the Geneva Convention also stipulates that "any kind of physical mutilation or medical or scientific experiment, which is not required for the medical, dental or hospital treatment of the prisoner of war concerned and for his own benefit, shall not be applied to the prisoner of war." The American aggressor forces have openly violated this provision. Their guilty Landing Craft No. 1091 used a large number of our captured personnel for germ experiments in Wonsan and Geoje Island, causing 80% of the prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camps to contract diseases. What is particularly hateful is that the American aggressors, in violation of Articles 3 and 13 of the Geneva Convention, carried out inhumane large-scale massacres of our captured personnel one after another. The American imperialists' monstrous crimes of openly violating the Geneva Convention, abusing, insulting, and slaughtering prisoners of war, were all carried out under the eyes of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which was "completely free to inspect these prisoners of war" (U.S. Information Service, Tokyo, December 15, 1951). However, this so-called "impartial international organization" of Acheson, which everywhere flaunts the Geneva Convention, has not only failed to prevent or condemn these brutal crimes from beginning to end, but has also covered up for the criminals by "constantly claiming that the conditions in these prisoner-of-war camps are good" (Associated Press, Tokyo, December 14, 1951). Doesn't this show that the International Committee of the Red Cross was originally an accomplice of the United States? Especially after the U.S. military carried out two major massacres of prisoners of war on February 18th and March 13th, the U.S. military immediately claimed that the International Committee of the Red Cross was conducting an "independent investigation" on the spot. And the "investigation" has been going on until now, and with regard to the February 18th massacre, more than a month later, people have not seen half a word of the committee's report on this massacre. It is certainly not an easy thing to make such a report for the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is dressed in the beautiful clothes of the Geneva Convention to serve the American imperialists. If its report is roughly the same as what the United States has published, wouldn't that expose its despicable face of serving the American aggressors?! If it tells the truth, wouldn't its master be completely at a disadvantage?! The lackeys of American imperialism are so embarrassed and despicable.

    The International Committee of the Red Cross likes to flaunt that it has forwarded to our side a list of our captured personnel in the U.S. military prisoner-of-war camps. In fact, this cannot be said to be a list. It is just a large pile of English phonetic characters. It is impossible for people to recognize a Chinese or Korean name from these English phonetic characters. The departments, ranks, and military numbers are all chaotic and incomplete. Moreover, on the list, a part of our captured personnel are arbitrarily reclassified as so-called civilians, so that when the American aggressor forces hand over the list to our side, they can withhold the list of that part of the so-called civilians who have been illegally reclassified and refuse to hand it over. This is the shameless face of Acheson's "impartial international organization" racking its brains to do things for the U.S. government.

    When the news that the United States was carrying out germ warfare on a large scale in Korea and China aroused the great anger of the people all over the world, Acheson became anxious, and the International Committee of the Red Cross also became anxious. Acheson issued a statement on March 4th, saying that he "welcomes" the committee to investigate. The International Committee of the Red Cross immediately obeyed the order like a god and telegraphed our side's Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai on March 5th, requesting to come to the rear of our army, but did not dare to mention the word investigation of bacteria. Then, Acheson publicly "invited" the International Committee of the Red Cross to investigate on March 11th, and the International Committee of the Red Cross hurriedly stated on March 13th that it had telegraphed Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai on March 12th, requesting to organize some committee to conduct the investigation. The International Committee of the Red Cross responded to Acheson so quickly, even disregarding its own so-called regulations that it had no power to investigate. This only needs to be compared with its attitude towards other accusations about the atrocities of the U.S. military to see how blatantly the American slave face of this so-called "impartial" International Committee of the Red Cross is exposed. People remember that the International Women's Investigation Group on the atrocities of the U.S. and Li Cheng-wan armies in Korea gave the International Committee of the Red Cross an investigation report, accusing the U.S. military of atrocities. After receiving the report, the committee was greatly panicked, fearing that someone would ask it to investigate, which would make its position extremely embarrassing. It hurriedly distributed a memorandum everywhere on November 23rd last year, stating that it had no power to investigate violations and destruction of international law based on various reasons. In order to prevent anyone from specifically asking it to undertake the investigation of the U.S. military's atrocities, it specifically brought out its 1939 regulations, which are:

    "Unless (a) authorized in advance by a convention, (b) there is a special agreement of all parties concerned, the International Committee cannot undertake the investigation." This regulation is very useful. The International Committee of the Red Cross certainly knows that no convention authorizes it to conduct investigations. It also knows that the parties concerned in the Korean War can never make any special agreement to ask it to investigate the atrocities of the U.S. military. Therefore, this door of embarrassment is closed, and there is no danger. Who knows that only four months later, the person who wanted it to investigate actually appeared, and this was exactly Acheson, in order to escape the world's condemnation of the United States' germ warfare, ordered it to go to the rear of the two armies to "investigate." At this critical moment, the International Committee of the Red Cross forgot all the reasons and regulations it had put forward four months ago to facilitate the refusal to investigate the atrocities of the U.S. military. May I ask what convention's authorization and what special agreement's regulations Acheson used to ask the International Committee of the Red Cross to investigate bacteria? What did the International Committee of the Red Cross rely on to accept Acheson's request? Why did the International Committee of the Red Cross deliberately refuse the imaginary people's request to investigate the atrocities of the U.S. military, but hurriedly executed Acheson's order to come to the rear of our army to investigate? What is your impartiality? What is your neutrality? Your own actions fully prove that you are nothing more than the most vile, most shameless, and most despicable accomplices and pawns of the American imperialists. The purpose of your investigation is obviously to investigate the effects of the American aggressor forces' extremely brutal crimes, and after the "investigation," to use your worthless report to exonerate the aggressor murderers. The Chinese and Korean people must never allow such accomplices and protectors of the American imperialists to enter our country under any name to carry out their despicable conspiracies. The news of the American imperialists' openly conducted germ warfare crimes in Korea and China must be spread to every remote corner of the world, so that the people of the world can transform righteous anger into great and powerful actions to break the evil bloody hands of the American imperialists.

    揭穿红十字国际委员会的假面具
    中朝人民绝不能容忍这种美帝国主义的同谋犯和走狗进入我们的国家来进行其可耻的阴谋
    【新华社二十二日讯】本社记者就美国侵略者要求“红十字国际委员会”来调查我方对美国进行细菌战的谴责一事发表评论如下：
    美国国务卿艾奇逊急于要找一个很好的掩蔽部，来逃避全世界人民对美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战的共同一致的愤怒和谴责，曾经在三月四日发表声明，抵赖他们所犯的滔天大罪，并声明“欢迎由像红十字国际委员会这样的国际机构进行公正的调查”。三月十一日艾奇逊又致电红十字国际委员会，指定该会是“公正无私的国际机构”要它在“朝鲜战线的两边进行”关于细菌战的调查，并肯定该会“将提供佐证，说明关于细菌战的指摘的不真实性”。三月十九日，美国驻联合国裁减军备委员会代表柯亨又建议要这个红十字国际委员会来调查我方对美军进行细菌战的谴责。
    人们看见了美国的这些行动，不禁奇怪为什么美帝国主义者对红十字国际委员会这样偏爱、这样信赖，口口声声赞美它的“公正无私”，把他们的血腥罪行付托给这个机构去调查。但这只要看看这个美帝国主义者所谓“公正无私的”机构在朝鲜战争中站在美国侵略者一边所干的睁眼闭眼的无耻勾当，就知道这个打着红十字的招牌，实际上为美帝国主义者服务的机构，是早已以它背弃它所奉为经典的日内瓦战俘公约和支持美国侵略军暴行的记录而取得了美帝国主义的宠爱的了。
    大家知道红十字国际委员会自美帝国主义发动了侵朝战争以来，就以奉行日内瓦公约的名义在南朝鲜为美国侵略军服务。但是美国侵略者却恰恰在处理我方被俘人员方面，想出种种残暴无比的办法来侮辱、虐待和屠杀这些按照日内瓦公约应该受到完全相反待遇的人们。日内瓦公约第三条和第十三条都规定了要保护俘虏不受虐待、威胁、侮辱或毁伤他们的身体。可是，美国侵略者因为要扣留我方被俘人员，竟进行所谓“甄别”、“讯问”我方被俘人员的有意侮辱行为，并派遣大批蒋李匪帮的特务在被俘人员的臂上强迫刺上“反共抗俄”的极端侮辱字样，强迫他们写血书。事后，美国负责管理战俘的军官并公然亲自出面来威胁这些已经被毁伤了身体、被侮辱了的人们说，如果他们回到我方，“他们就只有死路一条”。日内瓦公约第十三条又规定“任何种类的身体毁伤或医疗的或科学的试验，如非有关战俘在医疗、牙科或住院方面的治疗所应需，并为其本人的利益者，均不得施用于该战俘”。美国侵略军对这一条文又是公然破坏了的。他们那只罪恶的第一○九一号登陆艇就曾经在元山和巨济岛，大量以我方被俘人员作细菌试验，致使俘虏营中百分之八十的战俘都染上了病症。尤其令人痛恨的是：美国侵略者竟破坏日内瓦公约第三条和第十三条的规定，接二连三地对我方被俘人员进行惨无人道的大规模屠杀。美帝国主义者这种公然破坏日内瓦公约，虐待、侮辱和屠杀战俘的弥天罪行，都是在“完全可以自由视察这些战俘”（美国新闻处东京一九五一年十二月十五日电）的红十字国际委员会的耳目之下进行的。可是这个到处以日内瓦公约相标榜的、艾奇逊的“公正无私的国际机构”，对于这些残暴罪状却自始至终不但不加阻止，不加谴责，反而以“不断声称这些战俘营中的情况是良好的”（美联社东京一九五一年十二月十四日电）来替罪犯们掩护。这不是表明该红十字国际委员会原是美国的同谋犯是什么？尤其是当美军在二月十八日和三月十三日对战俘进行了两次大屠杀之后，美军方面便立即声称红十字国际委员会正在现场进行“独立的调查”。而“调查”到现在，以二月十八日惨案来说，一个多月之后，人们还未见到该会关于这次惨案有半个字的报告出现。作这样的报告对于这个披着日内瓦公约的漂亮外衣来为美帝国主义者作伥的红十字国际委员会当然不是一件容易事情啊。如果它的报告与美国方面所发表的大同小异，那岂不是揭穿了它的可耻的为美国侵略者服务的面目？！如果它说出真相，那么它的主人岂不是要完全处于不利地位？！美帝国主义的走狗就是这样狼狈而卑鄙的。
    红十字国际委员会喜欢卖弄它曾经转交我方一份在美军俘虏营中我方被俘人员的名单。这实际上不能说是一份名单，它只是一大堆的英文拼音字，人们不可能从这些英文拼音字辨识出一个中文的或朝文的姓名，其部别、级别、军号都是混乱不全，而且在名单上，擅自将我方一部分被俘人员重新分类为所谓平民，以便美国侵略军在向我方交出名单时，将那一部分被非法从新分类的所谓平民的名单扣留，拒不交出。这就是艾奇逊的“公正无私的国际机构”挖空心思替美国政府办事的无耻面目。
    当美国在朝鲜和中国大量进行细菌战的消息激起了全世界人民烈火般的巨大愤怒之后，艾奇逊着了急，红十字国际委员会也着了急。艾奇逊于三月四日发表声明，说“欢迎”这个会去调查。红十字国际委员会立即奉命如神地于三月五日给我方金日成最高司令官和彭德怀司令员来电，要求来到我军后方，但却不敢提调查细菌字样。接着，艾奇逊又于三月十一日公开“邀请”红十字国际委员会来调查，红十字国际委员会又急急于三月十三日声言它已经于十二日致电金日成最高司令官和彭德怀司令员，要求组织一个什么委员会来进行调查。红十字国际委员会对艾奇逊这样如响斯应，甚至连违反它自己所谓的没有调查权力的规定，都置之不顾。这只要与它对待其他方面关于美军暴行的控诉的态度对照
    一看，就知道这个所谓“公正无私的”红十字国际委员会的美国奴才的嘴脸暴露得是如何露骨。人们记得国际妇女对朝鲜美李军暴行调查团曾经给了红十字国际委员会一个调查报告，对美军暴行提出控诉。该会接到报告之后，大为恐慌，深怕有人要它去调查，以致使它的地位万分尴尬，急急于去年十
    一月二十三日向到处分发一个备忘录，声明自己根据种种理由，并无权力调查违反和破坏国际公法的事件。为防止万一有人要特请它担任调查美军暴行工作起见，它特把它一九三九年的规定搬出来，该规定为：
    “除非（甲）已由一个公约事先授权，（乙）已有全体有关方面的特别协议，国际委员会不能担任调查。”这个规定是很有用处的。红十字国际委员会当然知道没有什么公约授权它担任调查。它更知道朝鲜战争中的有关方面绝不可能搞什么特别协议来请它调查美军暴行。因此这一道出丑的门是关死了，没有危险了。谁知事隔仅四个月，要它作调查的人居然出现，而这恰恰就是艾奇逊为了要逃避世人关于美国进行细菌战的谴责，出来命令它到两军后方去“调查”。红十字国际委员会当此紧要关头，竟然忘记了它为了便于拒绝调查美军暴行，在四个月前搬出来的种种理由和规定。试问艾奇逊究竟依据什么公约的授权和什么特别协定的规定来要求红十字国际委员会调查细菌？红十字国际委员会又根据什么来接受艾奇逊的要求？红十字国际委员会为什么要蓄意拒绝它假想中的人民对于调查美军暴行的要求，而却急不暇择地执行艾奇逊的命令，要来我军后方调查？你们的公正是什么？你们的中立又是什么？你们自己的行为完全证明你们自己不过是美帝国主义者最恶劣、最无耻、最卑贱的同谋和走卒。你们要来调查的目的明显的是要替美国侵略军调查他们的残暴无比的罪行的效果，并要在“调查”之后，以你们的一文不值的报告来洗脱侵略者杀人犯的罪名。中朝人民绝不能容许这种美帝国主义者的同谋犯和掩护者假借任何名义进入我们的国家，来进行其可耻的阴谋。美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国所公然进行的细菌战的罪恶消息必须要传布到全世界任何一个最偏僻的角落里去，让全世界人民化正义的愤怒为伟大的有力的行动，来打断美帝国主义者罪恶的血手。
