　　▲ Further development has been achieved in maternal and child health work in the Northwest region. According to statistics: there are now two maternal and child health hospitals and nine maternal and child health stations in the region. A few ethnic minority maternal and child health stations have been established in cities such as Dihua and Yinchuan. Health departments and bureaus of various provinces often dispatch epidemic prevention teams, including maternal and child health workers, to remote ethnic minority areas for mobile prevention and treatment. More than 9,000 midwives have been trained and old-style midwives have been reformed in various places; in addition, 598 intermediate-level health workers and 74 factory health workers have been trained. Maternity stations are also being gradually established in factories, rural areas, and some pastoral areas.
　　In terms of child health, health organizations at all levels have made the prevention of acute infectious diseases in children a regular central task, and have universally vaccinated children against smallpox and other preventative inoculations; more than 6,000 children in Xi'an have been vaccinated with BCG. Some rural areas have piloted seasonal nurseries. According to statistics from the Health Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee at the end of last year, there were 102 such nurseries and 63 mutual aid baby-sitting groups.
　　Various localities have vigorously promoted maternal and child health publicity. Women are very welcome to maternal and child health exhibitions that use models, wall charts, slides, and other promotional methods. Gansu Province has held four maternal and child health exhibitions in Lanzhou, Tianshui, and other places, with more than 100,000 visitors.
　　▲ The fourth session of the Russian language broadcast lectures jointly organized by the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station will begin in mid-April.
　　This session will have three classes: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. The study period is eight months for all. The beginner class starts with the Russian alphabet. Those participating in the intermediate class should have studied five or six hundred words and have a basic knowledge of Russian grammar. Students participating in the beginner and intermediate classes will be issued a certificate of completion by the Russian language lecture series after passing the graduation examination. The advanced class is specifically designed to assist those with an intermediate level of Russian for self-study and offers courses in Russian literary selections and Russian conversation.
　　Anyone who is willing to participate in the study and is confident that they can persevere, regardless of gender, age, or occupation, can register as a student.
