    Enhancing the Proficiency of Party Workers
    An editorial in the Soviet newspaper Pravda on February 24 discusses the importance of improving the skills of Party workers and the methods for doing so. The abstract is as follows:
    The tasks of economic and cultural construction place high demands on Party cadres, thus necessitating the improvement of the ideological and professional level of Party workers.
    To improve the political and theoretical level of Party workers, the Party has done tremendous work in rectifying the network of Party schools and Party training courses. Higher Party Schools attached to the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and Party schools in various republics, regions, and provinces have been established. In addition, there are training courses and seminars (i.e., led classroom discussions) organized by local Party organizations.
    A Party worker should fully understand the cause he leads and should profoundly and correctly analyze the most complex problems in ideological work and economic issues. A Party worker should master rich knowledge to ensure the successful completion of tasks in all fields; he should skillfully inspire the creativity of industrial and agricultural workers to complete or overfulfill state tasks.
    It is the responsibility of Party organizations to constantly care about the improvement of their cadres' knowledge and the growth of their culture, and to teach them to correctly combine the Party's political work with economic work.
    Improving the proficiency of Party workers is a great and important undertaking. The training and advanced studies of cadres must be carried out under the direct leadership of the Party committees and their secretaries.
    Caring for the growth of Party workers cannot be limited to lessons in Party schools, training courses, and seminars. Educating cadres in practical work and providing them with direct guidance and assistance locally are of great significance. This guidance is to teach them with concrete examples, making them understand how to solve problems and how to judge certain phenomena in local life. Discussing the reports of various Party organizations at meetings of higher-level Party committees is also a great school for cultivating and training Party cadres.
    Improving the proficiency of Party workers, patiently and caringly promoting new young cadres, is the most important responsibility of all Party organizations.

    On Methods of Reading
    The Soviet Komsomolskaya Pravda published on February 22 an essay by Slatoutsvidov in response to readers, concerning methods of reading. The abstract is as follows:
    The cultivation of reading skills requires a certain process. Readers with a lower level should start with simple note-taking and then gradually transition to more complex note-taking. However, before starting to take notes, one must carefully read, understand, and contemplate the material being read.
    The simplest form of note-taking is to make various marks and symbols in the original book. These marks allow the reader to focus entirely on the material he needs to read when reviewing, without having to read the entire text. But even this simplest form of recording requires thoughtful and meticulous reading.
    The next method of self-study reading is excerpting. Excerpting is necessary for everyone, even readers with a higher level. This method of note-taking is also easy for people who are beginning to read independently. The benefit of writing excerpts is that it requires you to read thoughtfully and helps you better grasp what you are reading.
    In addition, making a summary is a more complex form of reading method. Before making a summary, the entire text should be carefully read and thought about. It is not appropriate to write a summary during the first reading, because you have not yet familiarized yourself with the entire content of the book.
    The most important thing when making a summary is to be able to extract the main ideas from each article or paragraph. At the beginning, the more general arguments should be extracted first, and then the ideas related to explaining and developing these arguments should be classified. A correctly made summary can help to remember the main content of what has been read.
    Another method of note-taking is to write an overview. An overview is a brief and coherent narrative of the material being read. The time to write an overview should be when reading the second time, or while reading the second time, of a book, chapter, or section. When writing an overview, the author's ideas should be expressed primarily in one's own words. This method can promote better understanding and memorization of what has been read, make reading more focused, and gradually develop the habit of independently explaining the basic content of the book.
    The most complex form of note-taking is to make an outline. To make an extremely short and concise narrative of certain materials, making it a brief form of topic, is called an outline. There are two types of outlines: simple and detailed. A simple outline contains only one topic, usually expressed in one sentence. A detailed outline includes three parts: the main topic, the expanded argument, and the conclusion. Classic examples of various outlines can be found in the works of Lenin and Stalin.
    Finally, it should be emphasized that the ability of self-study is not acquired all at once, but is cultivated through repeated practice, training, and practical experience. This ability is extremely necessary for everyone, and especially important in political self-study.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    提高党的工作人员的熟练程度
    苏联真理报二月二十四日发表社论，论述提高党的工作人员的水平的重要性及其方法。摘要如下：
    经济建设和文化建设的任务，给党的干部提出了高度的要求，因此也提出了党的工作人员提高思想水平和业务水平的必要性。
    为了提高党的工作人员的政治水平和理论水平，党在整顿党校和党的训练班网方面，做了巨大工作。建立了附设在联共（布）中央下的高级党校和各共和国的、边区的以及省的党校。此外，还有各地方党组织所举办的训练班和习明纳尔（即有领导的课堂讨论）等。
    一个党的工作人员，应该完全了解他所领导的事业，应该深刻而正确地分析思想工作中最复杂的问题和经济问题。一个党的工作人员，应该掌握丰富的知识，以保证顺利完成各方面的任务；应该巧妙地启发工业和农业劳动者的创造性，以完成或超额完成国家的任务。
    党组织的责任，是要经常关怀自己干部知识水平的提高和文化的增长，教导他们把党的政治工作和经济工作正确地结合起来。
    提高党的工作人员的熟练程度，是一件伟大而重要的事业。干部的培养和深造必须在党委员会及其书记的直接领导下进行。
    关怀党的工作人员的成长，不能只局限于党校、训练班和习明纳尔中的功课。在实际工作中教育干部、在当地直接给他们的指导和帮助，是具有重大意义的。这种指导，即是以具体的实例教导他们，使他们明白应该怎样解决问题，应该怎样判断当地生活中的某些现象。在高级党委员会的会议上讨论各党组织的报告，也是培养和训练党的干部的一所大学校。
    提高党的工作人员的熟练程度，耐心地、关切地提拔新的青年干部，是各党组织最重要的责任。
    论读书的方法
    苏联共青真理报二月二十二日登载了斯拉陶茨维多夫为答复读者所写的一篇有关读书方法的论文。摘要如下：
    读书技能的培养需要一定的过程。水平较低的读者应当先从做简单的笔记开始，然后再逐渐地过渡到做较复杂的笔记。可是，在开始做笔记前，一定要注意地阅读、了解和熟思所读的材料。
    笔记中最简单的形式就是在原书上作各种不同的记号和标志。这种记号可以使阅读者在复习时不必阅读全文，而能完全集中注意于他所需要读的材料。但即使是这种最简单形式的记载，也需要深思的和精细的阅读。
    次一种自修的读书方法是摘录。对于所有的人，甚至是程度较高的读者来说，做摘录都是很必要的。这种笔记方式，对于开始独立读书的人，也是容易做到的。写摘录的好处是它要求你做深思的阅读，并能帮助你更好地掌握你所阅读的东西。
    此外，做提要是读书方法中比较复杂的一种形式。在进行做提要以前应当先把全文仔细读过并加以思考。在第一次阅读时便写提要是不适合的，因为你还没有熟习书的全部内容。
    做提要时最重要的是要能从每一篇或每一段中汲取其主要的思想。在开始时应当先把较为一般的论述摘引出来，然后再把有关解释和发挥这些论述的思想加以分类。做得正确的提要，可以帮助记忆所读过的主要内容。
    另一种笔记方式就是写概述，所谓概述就是把所阅读的材料作扼要而连贯的叙述。写概述的时间应当是在对一本书、一章或一节读完第二遍、或正在读第二遍的时候开始。在写概述时，主要应当用自己的话来表达作者的思想。这种方法可促使更好地理解和记忆所读过的东西，使读书时注意力更集中，并逐渐养成独立地说明书的基本内容的习惯。
    做笔记的最复杂的形式是做提纲。对某种材料作极简短扼要的叙述，使其成为一种简要的论题形式，这就叫做提纲。提纲有简单的和详细的两种。简单的提纲仅含有一个论题，通常都以一句话表达出来。详细的提纲则包括主要论题，展开的论证和结论三部分。在列宁和斯大林的著作中可以找到各种不同提纲的经典范例。
    最后，应当着重指出的是，自修的能力不是一下子获得的，而是经过重复的练习、锻练和实际经验才培养出来的。这种能力对于每一个人都是极端必需的，在政治自修方面尤为重要。
