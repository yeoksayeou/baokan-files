    Propaganda Work in State-Owned Industrial and Mining Enterprises During the "Three-Anti" Campaign
    Zhong Wen, Lu Ren

    Party organizations in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises across the country have launched large-scale mass propaganda campaigns during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, utilizing the Party's propaganda network. This propaganda effort has been extensive and powerful. It has played a significant role in mobilizing the masses, publicizing policies, exposing and attacking major corrupt elements, and criticizing bourgeois ideology. It has not only promoted the movement in industrial and mining enterprises but also raised the political consciousness of the working class, further strengthening the ties between Party organizations in these enterprises and the masses. The Party's propaganda network in industrial and mining enterprises has also grown stronger, gained more experience, and discovered some patterns in propaganda work within these enterprises.

    I. Party Organizations in Industrial and Mining Enterprises Must Guide Propaganda Work in Conjunction with Central Tasks

    At the beginning of the "Three-Anti" campaign, most Party committees or branches in industrial and mining enterprises first convened meetings of propaganda representatives, joint meetings of propaganda team leaders, propaganda conferences, propaganda work meetings, etc. Reporters were organized to give reports, explaining the significance and policies of the "Three-Anti" campaign to propagandists. These meetings also outlined the steps and methods for propaganda work in the "Three-Anti" campaign and specifically deployed the propaganda effort. Then, under the leadership of the Party committee or branch, a strong propaganda team was formed with Party propagandists as the backbone, along with the propaganda forces of the trade union, the Communist Youth League, other propaganda cadres, and activists, forming a propaganda group or central propaganda group. This group was under the unified leadership of the Party committee or branch, with designated personnel responsible for its management, ensuring that the propaganda content and steps of the entire group were unified. Various propaganda tools and methods were used to divide into various propaganda subgroups, such as cartoon subgroups, wall newspaper subgroups, broadcasting subgroups, storytelling subgroups, oral propaganda subgroups, etc. A division of labor and responsibility system for propaganda was implemented in all workshops, business departments, employee dormitories, and employee family dormitories, ensuring that someone was responsible for propaganda everywhere. Spot checks were conducted promptly through tests, interviews, and discussions to eliminate any blank spots in the propaganda field and ensure that everyone was educated in the "Three-Anti" campaign.

    According to the various stages of the "Three-Anti" campaign, the Party committee or branch promptly determined the propaganda content and convened propaganda meetings or propaganda group meetings to direct the propaganda work. The propaganda team of the Beijing Station of the Tianjin Railway Administration repeatedly explained the policies to the masses during the mobilization and confession stage, using real-life examples to expand the influence of the policies. During the denunciation stage, they focused on dispelling ideological concerns in denunciation, exposing the rumors spread by corrupt elements and their conspiracies to resist the movement, and supporting the masses. In the "tiger"-beating stage, they concentrated their efforts on targeting the "tigers," exposing all their thoughts and actions, pursuing them closely, and not allowing them a moment to breathe. This concentrated, synchronized propaganda effort powerfully promoted the development of the "Three-Anti" campaign.

    II. The Content of Propaganda Should Target the Thoughts of the Masses and Make Good Use of Real-Life Examples to Fully Unleash the Power of Propaganda

    At the beginning of the "Three-Anti" campaign in various industrial and mining enterprises, many employees were ideologically numb, either claiming that there was not much corruption in their departments or believing that the movement was irrelevant to them. They failed to recognize the harm of the bourgeoisie's attack on state-owned enterprises and, therefore, could not understand the great significance of the "Three-Anti" campaign. Many propagandists in industrial and mining enterprises, targeting the thoughts of the masses at the time, first used vivid facts familiar to the employees to expose the crimes of unscrupulous merchants and corrupt elements, and then used accounting methods to specifically explain to the workers the serious losses caused by these crimes to the national construction effort and to the workers' lives. When mobilizing workers to participate in the "Three-Anti" struggle, Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Mill explained to the workers that the funds embezzled by the factory, plus the losses caused by the embezzlement, were almost equal to the entire profit of the factory's increased production and conservation plan for the first quarter. This immediately aroused the anger of the workers and powerfully stimulated their fighting spirit. In the past, when loading and unloading goods, workers at the Tianjin Railway Bureau often experienced damaged cargo boxes or leaky tarpaulins during rain. Although the workers worked hard, many compensation accidents still occurred. After the propagandist Teng Hongtao exposed the fact that unscrupulous merchants bribed cadres and cut corners when manufacturing wooden boxes and tarpaulins, the workers were very angry at the unscrupulous merchants and corrupt elements. They deeply realized that "after the 'Three-Anti' campaign, there will be fewer accidents, and production will be easier to manage."

    After the "Three-Anti" campaign in industrial and mining enterprises entered the confession and denunciation stage, concrete facts were used to explain the policies to the masses, motivating corrupt elements to confess and dispelling the masses' concerns about denunciation. Many employees in industrial and mining enterprises personally witnessed examples at the anti-corruption rallies where corrupt elements who confessed thoroughly were treated leniently, while those who refused to confess were arrested and punished according to the law, thus concretely understanding the policies of the People's Government. Mobilizing confessed corrupt elements to confess at group meetings, and explaining policies on the spot to encourage confession, also played a significant role. Some workers felt that they did not have enough evidence to dare to denounce. The branch of the Second Workshop of a factory in Northeast China guided the propagandists to create a cartoon called "Tracking Down," illustrating that a corrupt element could be found based on a single clue. After the cartoon was posted, an old worker provided a clue, which later led to the discovery that an employee responsible for hauling scrap iron had accepted bribes of 18 million yuan and two gold rings. The branch used this fact to vigorously promote the campaign, and in half a month, it mobilized workers to report more than 350 cases of corruption.

    When besieging major corrupt elements, a fierce propaganda offensive was launched against their various schemes to resist and sabotage the movement. Cartoons, clapper talks, and living newspapers were used to promptly expose various tricks of corrupt elements, such as holding secret meetings, forming "offensive and defensive alliances," pretending to be active to cover up their crimes, and writing "guarantees" to deceive the masses. This exposure had to be quick and accurate, and the depiction had to be concrete and vivid, completely isolating the major corrupt elements in front of the masses, leaving them with no way out and no choice but to confess their crimes. This propaganda not only destroyed the corrupt elements' conspiracies to resist the movement but also greatly encouraged the fighting spirit of the masses.

    It should be particularly mentioned here that in order for industrial and mining propaganda work to have the ideological and combative nature mentioned above, it is necessary to fully and promptly grasp the ideological situation of the masses. Therefore, many industrial and mining enterprises used methods such as holding brainstorming sessions or propaganda team meetings to listen to propagandists' reports and direct propagandists to collect materials, which was very important.

    III. Political Propaganda and Production Propaganda Must Be Combined

    The political tasks and economic tasks of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises are inseparable. It is unacceptable to bury oneself in production without regard for politics, nor is it permissible to engage in empty political slogans while neglecting production. The same is true for propaganda work in the "Three-Anti" campaign, which must explain that the "Three-Anti" campaign is paving the way for increased production, conservation, and large-scale economic construction. All employees must be mobilized to thoroughly catch the "tigers" and repel the bourgeoisie's attack. Otherwise, the fruits of our production will be stolen, our construction will be sabotaged, and we will return to the dark days of being slaves and beasts of burden. At the same time, we must intensify production and ensure the completion of production plans. Neglecting production will cause production to shrink, become disconnected from other economic sectors of the country, affect the completion of the national economic plan, and cause losses to national construction. This, of course, cannot enable the "Three-Anti" campaign to lay the foundation for increased production and conservation. Therefore, it is necessary to call on employees to ensure victory on both the "Three-Anti" and production fronts.

    Some propaganda teams in industrial and mining enterprises, based on the spirit mentioned above, put forward vivid and inspiring slogans to the employees and launched a competition combining the "Three-Anti" and production, powerfully inspiring the employees' political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm. For example, propagandists at Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Mill proposed: "Concentrate on production in the workshop to ensure exceeding the task; fiercely pursue corrupt elements outside the workshop to resolutely wipe them out in one fell swoop." Employees responsible for anti-corruption tasks and those responsible for production tasks made mutual guarantees to concentrate their efforts on anti-corruption and actively engage in production. The anti-corruption struggle quickly achieved victory, and they reported their achievements to each other, encouraging each other to continue their efforts. The good news of production supported the anti-corruption struggle, and the victory of anti-corruption greatly inspired the employees' production enthusiasm. Although some key workers were drawn from the workshops, production efficiency continued to increase. Employees of the No. 1 Mine under the Datong Mining Bureau used the slogan during the "Three-Anti" campaign: "Produce more coal down the well, catch 'tigers' above the well, and strive to be a model mine." Employees both above and below ground mutually guaranteed: to be a model on the production front and a "tiger"-catching hero on the anti-corruption front. During the "Three-Anti" campaign, the mine's production volume increased even more than before. On February 15th, a new record of 1,078 tons of coal produced per day was created.

    During the "Three-Anti" campaign, it is even more important to mobilize employees to pay attention to security work such as epidemic prevention, theft prevention, anti-espionage, air defense, and fire prevention, strengthen factory protection organizations and various security systems, and educate employees to abide by labor discipline, ensure product quality, strictly implement technical operating procedures, and never be absent without reason. Persuade employees to consciously abide by these systems and disciplines and incorporate them into their patriotic pledges and conscientiously implement them. Only by organically linking political propaganda and production propaganda in this way and promptly guiding the workers' political enthusiasm to production can the complete victory of the "Three-Anti" campaign be guaranteed.

    IV. Leverage Mass Wisdom to Create a Variety of Lively and Popular Propaganda Forms

    In the propaganda work of this "Three-Anti" campaign, industrial and mining enterprises in various regions have leveraged the wisdom of the masses to create and utilize a variety of lively propaganda forms tailored to the tastes of the working masses.

    The first is the mobile propaganda team (propaganda station or propaganda group). The advantage of the mobile propaganda team is that it can not only conduct propaganda and mobilization at any time and any place in the workshops and groups of the unit, but also set out to other units and among the families of employees to carry out propaganda. The mobile propaganda team of a factory in Anshan used forms such as drums, clapper talks, and cartoons to conduct propaganda and mobilization in various factories, mobilizing the vast masses of workers to participate in the "Three-Anti" struggle. A branch of a sub-bureau of Tianjin Railway established a mobile propaganda station, and used clapper talks and short plays to conduct thirty minutes of propaganda to the employees during the midday break every day, with very good results.

    The second is cartoons. Cartoons can make propaganda content more visual, easily attract the masses, and have a strong combative nature, becoming a powerful weapon in this "Three-Anti" struggle. According to the experience of various regions, in using cartoons for propaganda, in addition to the production of cartoons being timely and vivid, they must also be targeted. At the beginning of the "Three-Anti" campaign, workers at a factory in Mudanjiang thought: "What's the use of doing the 'Three-Anti'? It's enough to increase production!" The factory's model propagandist, Wei Yingjie, targeted this mentality and drew this cartoon in a timely manner: Many workers are actively increasing production and saving resources, creating a lot of wealth for the country; however, corrupt elements are sitting there enjoying the benefits and stealing state property. This painting appropriately reminded the working masses. When besieging major corrupt elements at the Beijing Station of the Beijing Railway Sub-Bureau, propagandists aimed at the ideological trends of the corrupt elements and attacked step by step, continuously drawing more than thirty cartoons in ten days. When investigating the case of the stolen "fox fur," several thieves held secret meetings every day. The propagandists drew a cartoon exposing their formation of an "offensive and defensive alliance." Later, they discovered that they had signed a "conscience contract," and immediately used a cartoon to expose it, and wrote: "The 'conscience contract' is unreliable." Some thieves pretended to be active and also mixed in with the masses to investigate, crying "stop thief!" The propagandists drew a person carrying fox fur on their back, shouting: "Where did the fox fur go?" Under such step-by-step pursuit, the thieves finally had to bow their heads and confess their crimes.

    The third is clapper talk. Clapper talk is the most popular and familiar form of propaganda among the working masses and is well-suited to the tastes of the masses. When using clapper talk, seize the material and compose it, compose it and sing it. Han Shulai, an activist in clapper talk creation at a factory in Northeast China, composed a clapper talk based on the factory's corrupt elements' tendency to avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, refusing to clarify the issues: "Avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial is impossible, everyone can understand it; if you hide it and don't talk about it, you're just making it harder for yourself." At the same time, Han Shulai's clapper talk also used very appropriate metaphors. For example, the crosstalk clapper talk he created to describe the phenomenon of waste said: "We are painstakingly picking sesame seeds all over the ground, how can we tolerate them spilling barrels of sesame oil outside?" A few words made the working masses clearly see the harm of waste.

    The fourth is the "Three-Anti" exhibition. In order to systematically expose the bourgeoisie's attack on the working class over the past three years with true evidence, many industrial and mining enterprises have held "Three-Anti" exhibitions. According to the experience of Shanghai No. 9 State-Owned Cotton Mill, the exhibition must first determine the exhibition content according to the thoughts of the masses. For example, the factory leaders discovered in advance that there was a general right-leaning mood among the masses, and the corrupt elements had ideological concerns about confession. The exhibition prominently illustrated the facts of the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on the working class in the past three years with cartoons and objects; at the same time, it collected the tricks of the corrupt elements in the factory during the "Three-Anti" campaign, as well as the factory's anti-corruption achievements and model deeds, and combined the specific facts in the factory to explain the policies. Secondly, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to collect materials to enrich the exhibition content. The third is to pay attention to training docents after preparations are complete. The factory selected 48 excellent propagandists from various workshops and outstanding propaganda team members from study classes as docents, and carried out ideological mobilization for them in advance. With docents providing explanations, even illiterate workers and family members can understand the exhibits.

    The fifth is the workers' newspaper reading group. The workers' newspaper reading group is a powerful organization in industrial and mining enterprises that regularly conducts current affairs propaganda. It can promptly introduce the situation of the "Three-Anti" campaign in various regions to the masses, explain the policies of the "Three-Anti" campaign in detail, and organize workers to hold discussions and discussions. When the "Three-Anti" campaign was launched, the fourteen newspaper reading groups of the Third Workshop of a factory in Shenyang actively conducted propaganda to the working masses; when the movement entered the confession and denunciation stage, the newspaper reading groups selected various materials and articles related to denunciation in the newspaper to read, and combined the actual situation in the factory to conduct discussions, and as a result, many people unfolded denunciation during newspaper reading and discussions. According to the experience of various regions, when establishing and developing workers' newspaper reading groups, the Party, the administration, and the trade union must attach sufficient importance and specific leadership to avoid being merely a formality.

    In addition, many industrial and mining enterprises used methods such as broadcast loudspeakers, blackboard newspapers, wall newspapers, slogans, big-character posters, "magic lantern" shows, and living newspapers to conduct propaganda. Some organized mass meetings, organized the masses to listen to live broadcasts of large-scale meetings, some set up propaganda squares, and some used methods such as "political question and answer columns," "stolen goods self-reports," and "denunciation box self-reports" to conduct propaganda. The creation and use of these propaganda forms not only played a significant role in the "Three-Anti" campaign, but also have great significance for the future propaganda work of industrial and mining enterprises.

    V. Combine with the Central Work to Consolidate and Develop the Propaganda Network

    During the propaganda work of this "Three-Anti" campaign, a large number of propaganda work activists have continuously emerged in industrial and mining enterprises in various regions. These activists are not only enthusiastic about their work, but also many of them can write, draw, and speak, and have very good propaganda skills. They are the fresh force of propaganda work in industrial and mining enterprises, and Party organizations in industrial and mining enterprises must attach importance to their training and education, and promptly develop those excellent propaganda activists into Party propagandists to enrich and strengthen the ranks of propagandists. By the end of February, nine units in Beijing's industrial and mining enterprises had developed more than 300 propagandists. By the end of the anti-corruption movement, it is estimated that each industrial and mining enterprise can develop at least 1,000 to 1,500 propagandists, which is equivalent to 75 percent of the total number of propagandists in each industrial and mining enterprise before the anti-corruption movement.

    Propaganda organizations in various industrial and mining enterprises, such as newspaper reading groups, wall newspaper groups, and cartoon subgroups, have also made great progress in this "Three-Anti" campaign. For example, the number of newspaper reading groups in the Sixth Workshop of a factory in Shenyang increased from 56 to 74, and more than 98 percent of the workers participated in newspaper reading. These mass propaganda organizations should be strengthened in their leadership, helped to establish various systems, and assigned work on time, so as to consolidate them and continue to play a role in future propaganda work.

    According to the experience of various regions, timely convening propaganda work meetings, exchanging propaganda experiences, and commending models at each stage of the movement have greatly promoted propaganda work and improved the level of propaganda work. At the end of the movement, propaganda experience should be systematically summarized, the organization of the propaganda network should be rectified, and various systems for Party organizations in industrial and mining enterprises to lead the propaganda network should be strengthened, which can further consolidate the Party's propaganda network in industrial and mining enterprises.

    国营工矿企业在“三反”运动中的宣传工作
    衷文  鲁仁
    各地国营工矿企业党的组织在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，运用党的宣传网开展了大规模的群众宣传工作。这次宣传工作声势浩大，火力非常猛烈。在发动群众、宣传政策、检举和进攻大贪污犯，批判资产阶级的思想等方面，都发挥了巨大的作用。它既推动了工矿企业的运动，又提高了工人阶级的政治觉悟；并使工矿企业党的组织和群众的联系更加密切。工矿企业党的宣传网在这次宣传工作中也获得更大的发展，受到了更多的锻炼；并创造了许许多多的经验，发现了工矿企业中宣传工作的一些规律。
    一、工矿企业党组织必须结合中心任务来指导宣传工作
    在这次“三反”运动开始时，各工矿企业的党委或支部，大多首先召开了宣传员代表会、宣传员小组长联席会、宣传员大会、宣传工作会议等，组织报告员在会上做报告，向宣传员讲解“三反”运动的意义和政策；并在会上说明“三反”运动宣传的步骤和方法，具体地布置“三反”运动的宣传工作。然后由党委或支委会主持，以党的宣传员为骨干，和工会、青年团的宣传力量及其他宣传干部和积极分子共同组成一支强大的宣传队伍，形成一个宣传组或宣传中心组。由党委或支部统一领导，并指定专人负责掌握。使全组的宣传内容和宣传步骤统一起来；并按照各种宣传工具和宣传方式划分各种宣传小组，如漫画小组、墙报小组、广播小组、说唱小组、口头宣传小组等等。对各车间、各业务部门，以及各职工宿舍、各职工家属宿舍，统统实行宣传的分工包干制度，务使一律有人负责宣传，并及时地用测验、访问、座谈等方式进行抽查，争取消灭宣传阵地上的空白，务使每个人都在“三反”运动中受到教育。
    根据“三反”运动发展的各个阶段，党委或支部及时地确定宣传内容，并随时召开宣传员会议或宣传组会议，来指挥宣传工作。天津铁路管理局北京站的宣传队伍，就在动员坦白检举阶段向群众反复地讲解政策，用真人实事扩大政策的影响。在检举阶段又着重扫除检举中的思想顾虑，揭发贪污分子造谣和抗拒运动的阴谋；并给群众撑腰。在打“虎”阶段，便集中力量瞄准“老虎”，把“老虎”的思想和一举一动全给揭露出来，跟踪追击，不让他们喘一口气。这种火力集中、步调一致的宣传工作，有力地推动了“三反”运动的发展。
    二、宣传的内容要针对群众思想，善于用真人实事，才能充分发扬宣传工作的火力
    各工矿企业在“三反”运动开始时，许多职工思想麻痹，不是说本部门贪污现象不多，就是认为运动和自己无关。没有认清资产阶级对国家企业进攻的危害性，所以也就不能了解“三反”运动的重大意义。许多工矿的宣传员就针对当时群众的思想，首先用职工群众所熟悉的生动事实，来揭发奸商和贪污分子的罪行，并用算账的方法，向工人具体说明了这些罪行给国家建设事业、对工人生活等各方面所造成的严重损失。天津棉纺三厂在发动工人参加“三反”斗争时，向工人说明该厂被贪污的款项加上由于贪污所造成的损失，几乎等于该厂第一季增产节约计划的全部利润。这当时就激起了工人群众的愤怒，有力地鼓动了工人的斗争情绪。天津铁路局的装卸工人过去在搬运货物时，时常发生货物箱破裂，或下雨时盖货的篷布漏雨等情形，工人们虽然辛辛苦苦地工作，但仍然出了许多赔偿的事故。宣传员滕鸿涛向工人们揭发了奸商在承制木箱和篷布时贿赂干部、偷工减料的事实以后，工人们对奸商和贪污分子非常愤恨，他们深深体会到：“经过‘三反’后，能少出很多事故，生产就好搞了。”
    在工矿企业的“三反”运动进入坦白检举阶段以后，就要用具体事实向群众解释政策，动员贪污分子坦白，打破群众对检举的顾虑。许多工矿的职工群众都亲眼见到反贪污大会上的实例，即有的坦白彻底的贪污分子被宽大处理，有的拒不坦白的贪污分子被逮捕法办，因而具体地认识了人民政府的政策。有的动员已坦白的贪污分子在小组会上坦白，并当场讲解政策，鼓励坦白，也起了很大的作用。有些工人认为没有充分证据不敢检举。东北某厂第二车间的支部就指导宣传员针对这种思想，画出了一张叫做“跟踪追击”的漫画，说明根据一点线索，就可查出贪污犯。漫画贴出来以后，一个老工人即提出一个线索，后来从这个线索追查出拉废铁的职员受贿一千八百万元和两个金戒指。支部又用这个事实大力宣传，半个月就发动工人检举了贪污案件三百五十多件。
    在围攻大贪污犯时，就对准大贪污分子的种种抗拒和破坏运动的阴谋，发动猛烈的宣传攻势。用漫画、快板、活报剧等方式，及时地揭露贪污分子开秘密会，订“攻守同盟”，假装积极掩盖罪行，写“保证书”来欺骗群众等种种花招。这种揭露要快，要打得准，描画得要具体生动。使大贪污分子在群众面前完全孤立，弄得他无计可施，无路可逃，最后只有坦白认罪。这种宣传不仅摧毁了贪污分子抗拒运动的阴谋，而且也大大地鼓舞了群众的斗志。
    这里应该特别提到的，要想使工矿宣传工作具有上面所说的思想性和战斗性，必须充分地及时地掌握群众的思想情况，所以许多工矿在“三反”运动中，用召开碰头会或宣传员小组会等办法，来听取宣传员汇报，指挥宣传员搜集材料，这是非常重要的。三、政治宣传和生产宣传一定要结合起来
    国营工矿企业的政治任务和经济任务从来是不能分离的，不可只埋头生产，不问政治，也不允许空喊政治，忽视生产。在“三反”运动中的宣传工作也是一样，必须说明“三反”运动就是为增产节约和进行大规模的经济建设开辟道路。全体职工都要动员起来，彻底捉净“老虎”，打退资产阶级的进攻，不然，我们生产的果实就被盗窃，我们的建设就被破坏，我们就要回到做奴隶牛马的黑暗日子。同时我们又必须加紧生产，保证完成生产计划，忽视了生产，就会使生产萎缩，和国家的其他经济部门脱节，影响国家经济计划的完成，造成国家建设的损失。这当然也就不能使“三反”运动给增产节约奠定基础。所以必须号召职工保证在“三反”和生产两个战线上都打胜仗。
    有些工矿企业的宣传队伍就根据上面所说的精神，向职工群众提出了生动的鼓动口号，发动了
    “三反”和生产相结合的竞赛，有力地鼓舞了职工的政治热情和生产热情。如天津第五棉纺织厂宣传员提出：“在车间集中精力搞生产，保证超过任务；下车间猛烈追击贪污犯，坚决一网打尽。”担任反贪污任务和担负生产任务的职工，都互相提出了集中力量反贪污和积极生产的保证。反贪污斗争迅速获得胜利，他们便互相报告成绩，互相勉励继续努力。生产的捷报支持了反贪污斗争，反贪污的胜利又大大鼓舞了职工的生产热忱。车间里虽然抽出了一些骨干工人，而生产效率还是不断提高。大同矿务局所属第一矿职工在“三反”运动中的口号是：“下井多生产，上井捉‘老虎’，争取模范矿。”井上井下职工互相保证：在生产战线上当模范，在反贪污战线上当捉“虎”英雄。在“三反”运动期间，全矿的生产量比前更加提高。二月十五日创造了日产一千零七十八吨煤的新纪录。
    在“三反”运动中，更要动员职工注意防疫、防窃、防特、防空、防火等保安工作，加强护厂组织和各种保安制度，教育职工遵守劳动纪律，保证产品质量，严格执行技术操作规程，绝不无故缺勤。说服职工自觉地遵守这些制度和纪律，并把它订入自己的爱国公约里，认真执行。把政治宣传和生产宣传这样有机地联系起来，把工人的政治热情及时地引导到生产上来，才能保证“三反”运动的完满胜利。四、发挥群众智慧，创造各种生动活泼
    的宣传形式
    各地工矿企业在这次“三反”运动的宣传工作中，发挥了群众的智慧，创造和运用了各种生动活泼、适合工人群众口味的宣传形式。
    第一是流动宣传队（宣传站或宣传组）。流动宣传队的好处是：不仅能够随时随地在本单位的车间、小组中进行宣传鼓动，而且可以随时出发到其他单位以及职工家属中去进行宣传。鞍山某厂的流动宣传队，利用大鼓、快板、漫画等形式到各厂进行宣传动员，发动了广大工人群众参加“三反”斗争。天津铁路分局某支部建立了流动宣传站，每天中午的休息时间，用唱快板、表演短剧向职工进行三十分钟的宣传，效果很好。
    第二是漫画。漫画能使宣传内容形象化，容易吸引群众，并具有很强的战斗性，成了这次“三反”斗争中的一个有力武器。据各地经验，在使用漫画进行宣传时，除了漫画的制作要及时和生动外，还必须有的放矢。牡丹江某厂在“三反”运动开始时，工人们认为：“搞三反有啥用？提高生产就行呗！”该厂模范宣传员魏英杰针对这种思想情况，及时画出了这样的一幅漫画：许多工人正在积极增产节约，给国家创造了大量财富；可是贪污分子却在那里坐享其成，盗窃国家财产。这幅画恰当地提醒了工人群众。北京铁路分局北京站在围攻大贪污分子时，宣传员瞄准贪污分子的思想动态，步步进攻，在十天内就连续不断地画了三十多幅漫画。在追查“狐狸皮”被窃案件时，几个偷窃分子天天开秘密会议。宣传员便画了一张揭露他们订立“攻守同盟”的漫画。后来又发现他们订了“良心合同”，又马上用漫画给揭露出来，并写上：“‘良心合同’不可靠”。有的偷盗分子假装积极，也混在群众中追查，贼喊捉贼，宣传员便画了一个人背着狐狸皮，嘴里嚷着：“狐狸皮那里去了？”偷盗分子在这样步步追击之下，最后终于不得不低头认罪。
    第三是快板。快板是在工人群众中最流行、最熟悉的宣传方式，适合群众的口味。使用快板时，要抓住材料就编，编了就唱。东北某厂快板创作积极分子韩书来，根据该厂贪污分子避重就轻不肯谈清问题的情况，就编出快板说：“避重就轻不可能，人人都能听得懂；你要隐瞒还不谈，就是自己找难看。”同时，韩书来的快板譬喻也很恰当。如他创作的相声快板剧形容浪费现象说：“咱们满地辛辛苦苦拣芝麻，那能容他们把大桶香油往外洒？”几句话就使工人群众很清楚地看出浪费的危害性。
    第四是“三反”展览会。为了用真凭实据来系统地揭发资产阶级三年来对工人阶级的进攻，许多工矿都举办了“三反”展览会。据上海国棉九厂的经验，展览会首先要针对群众思想确定展览内容。如该厂领导方面事先发现了群众中普遍地存在着右倾情绪，贪污分子对坦白又有思想顾虑，展览会就以漫画和实物，突出地来说明三年来资产阶级向工人阶级猖狂进攻的事实；同时，搜集了厂内贪污分子在“三反”运动中搞鬼的花样，以及厂内反贪污斗争的战果和模范事迹，再结合厂内具体事实说明政策。其次要发动群众搜集材料，充实展览内容。第三是筹备就绪后，要注意培养讲解员。该厂抽调了各车间的优秀宣传员和学习班的优秀宣传队员四十八人作讲解员，并在事先向他们进行了思想动员。有讲解员进行讲解，就能使不识字的工人和家属都能看懂展览品。
    第五是工人读报组。工人读报组是在工矿企业中经常进行时事宣传的有力组织。它能及时向群众介绍各地“三反”运动的情况，详细地解释“三反”运动的政策，并组织工人座谈、讨论等。沈阳某厂第三车间的十四个读报组当“三反”运动展开时，读报组员就积极向工人群众进行宣传；当运动进入坦白、检举时，读报组就选择报上的各种有关检举的材料、文章来读，并联系厂内实际情况进行讨论，于是，很多人在读报讨论时，展开了检举。据各地经验，在建立和发展工人读报组时，党、行政、工会必须加以足够的重视和具体的领导，才能免于徒具形式。
    此外，许多工矿企业使用了广播筒、黑板报、墙报、标语、大字报、洋片、活报剧等方式进行宣传，有的组织群众座谈会，组织群众收听大会广播实况，有的设置了宣传广场，还有的用“政治问答栏”、“赃物自述”、“检举箱自述”等等方式进行宣传。这些宣传形式的创造和运用，不仅在“三反”运动中发挥了很大的作用，而且对今后工矿企业的宣传工作也有很大的意义。
    五、结合中心工作，巩固和发展宣传网
    各地工矿企业在这次“三反”运动的宣传工作中，都不断地涌现出大批的宣传工作积极分子。这些积极分子不但工作热情，而且其中有很多人会写、会画、会讲，有很好的宣传本领。这是工矿企业宣传工作的生力军，工矿企业党组织必须重视对他们的培养、教育，及时地发展那些优秀的宣传积极分子为党的宣传员，以充实和壮大宣传员的队伍。北京各工矿企业到二月底止，已有九个单位发展了三百多名宣传员。到反贪污运动结束时，估计各工矿企业至少可以发展宣传员一千到一千五百名，这个数字相当于反贪污运动前各工矿企业宣传员总数的百分之七十五。
    各工矿企业中的宣传组织，如读报组、墙报组、漫画小组等等，在这次“三反”运动中也有很大的发展。例如沈阳某厂第六车间的读报组由原来的五十六个发展到七十四个，百分之九十八以上的工人都参加了读报。对于这些群众宣传组织，应当加强领导，帮助建立各种制度，按时布置工作，使之巩固起来，在今后的宣传工作中继续发挥作用。
    据各地经验，在运动发展的每一段落，及时召开宣传工作会议，交流宣传经验，表扬模范，对推动宣传工作、提高宣传工作的水平都有很大作用。运动结束时，更应系统地总结宣传经验，整顿一下宣传网的组织，加强工矿企业中党组织领导宣传网的各种制度，这就能够进一步巩固工矿企业中党的宣传网。
