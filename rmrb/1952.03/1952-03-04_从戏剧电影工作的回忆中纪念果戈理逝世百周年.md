    Commemorating the Centenary of Gogol's Death: Recollections from Theater and Film Work
    Shi Dongshan
    Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol was one of Russia's great writers. He "was Pushkin's friend, student, and successor, a spiritual comrade of the most progressive people of his era… Although the artist Gogol had many differences of opinion with the democratic revolutionaries, he was their strong spiritual ally" (see "Literary Gazette" of the Soviet Union, 1952, 1, 17). He was once hailed as one of the founders of realistic literature and art. During that period, in Russia, any writer who demonstrated a realistic creative style was referred to as having a "Gogol tendency," and the period was even called the "Gogol period of Russian literature" (see He Jiahuai's translation: "On Russian Writers," in Zhdanov's "On Gogol"). He possessed the sharp eye for observing reality that all great writers have, as well as his own unique artistic talent and a sharp, humorous, and witty expressive style.
    In the past, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, when the reactionaries were rampant and cruelly oppressing the people, many progressive theater and film workers anxiously pondered how to break through that oppressive atmosphere, and they often naturally thought of Gogol and his works, wanting to learn from him.
    Gogol once used extremely clever expressive techniques to break through the censorship of the Tsarist Russian "officialdom" and published his strongly combative work "The Government Inspector" (or translated as "The Inspector General"), which was also performed (first performed in the spring of 1836 at the Alexandrinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, followed by the Maly Theater in Moscow).
    "The Government Inspector" profoundly and sharply exposed the malpractices in Tsarist Russian officialdom—blatant corruption and bribery, the incompetence, tyranny, and licentious and shameless lifestyles of some "officials," and the bribery of merchants. The characters he described were all real and vivid, not only making the Russians of the time feel that "such characters could be encountered among their relatives or neighbors at any time" (see the section on "The Government Inspector" in the preface to "Dead Souls"), but also, readers or viewers in countries ruled by the feudal and bourgeois classes would have the same feeling when seeing this play. The ugly features of the characters under Gogol's pen also exist among the rulers of those countries. The great Russian critic Belinsky said: "The satire in Gogol's works has world significance," and this assessment is correct.
    In China, in 1935, Gogol's "The Government Inspector" was performed for the first time in Shanghai. Although the play depicted the affairs of Tsarist Russian officialdom, and many customs were different from those in China, and even the translation of the dialogue had many awkwardnesses, it was already able to make the audience feel the power of the play, and Gogol's satire had its own practical significance for Chinese society and played a considerable role.
    At that time, the theatrical circles in Shanghai, under the name of the "Shanghai Amateur Drama Association," performed "The Government Inspector," laying a more solid foundation for their cause than ever before, thus making the theatrical movement in Shanghai, where culture was relatively concentrated at that time, more active.
    Since then, Gogol's plays have been performed all over China and have been warmly welcomed by audiences. Gogol has also been a spiritual ally and comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people.
    Relying on the success of "The Government Inspector" on the stage, I once adapted it into a film called "Carnival Night" (and used the original stage actors to perform). In the film's performance, the story and characters were changed to Chinese ones, and many plots and phenomena that were limited by the stage play and had to be narrated or described through the dialogue of the characters were presented directly through scenes. The dialogue was also "Chinesized" as much as possible, while retaining the spirit and meaning of the original work. This film also received a very good response when it was shown in various places. In the following three or four years, it was repeatedly shown in cinemas across the country, and as the Kuomintang's reactionary rule became increasingly decadent, the effect produced by the repeated screenings of this film became increasingly strong.
    Gogol's works, like other advanced Russian literary and artistic works, have had a profound influence on Chinese readers, especially literary and artistic workers.

    Gogol's spirit of being serious and meticulous about literary and artistic creation, humbly accepting criticism, and bravely correcting his mistakes is also a good example for us to learn from. According to the book "How Gogol Wrote," he burned several times works that he proved in front of his friends had not reached his ideal level. Mr. Lu Xun also mentioned in the postscript to the translation of the second part of "Dead Souls": "After the second part of 'Dead Souls' was completed, he didn't even believe in himself, and burned it before his death."
    Throughout Gogol's creative activities, he consistently demonstrated his attitude of valuing criticism. He once wrote in a letter to a friend: "Whoever is enthusiastic about the beautiful points in his own works cannot see the shortcomings and loses everything. If one is angered, that is to say, others are working hard to dig out all the filth in us and expose it so clearly, we must see clearly what this filth is," he said, "getting angry is useless." Therefore, as soon as his works were published, he would write to his friends, asking them to give him the strictest criticism, saying, "You should always say more to me than to others, and point out my shortcomings more." When he heard his friends praise his works, he would always say: "...But, what about those places that shouldn't be approved of... Can't you point them out?" When his work "The Government Inspector" had already been warmly welcomed by readers and audiences, he still wrote to his friends saying: "If I strictly and correctly study everything I have written before, I feel as if I am flipping through a student's or my own old exercise book, in which one page is wasted time due to laziness, and another page is due to impatience and sloppiness, the cowardly hands of a beginner and the bold bad habits of a mischievous person." Such a serious, humble, and willing to accept other people's criticism spirit is undoubtedly a factor in Gogol's creation of great works.
    According to a recent report in the Soviet "Literary Gazette": Gogol has more than a thousand letters, which will be published in his complete works. I think this will be very beneficial for us to learn from.
    Gogol once wrote in a letter to his friend:
     "We are called into the world, not entirely for festivals and
    feasts, we are called here to fight. Therefore, we
    should not forget for a moment that we have entered the battlefield, and here, we
    cannot simply choose less dangerous areas, but should like
    a good soldier, throw all of us into the struggle that is fierce
    place to go." --This passage written by Gogol is even more worthy of our eternal lesson.

    从戏剧电影工作的回忆中纪念果戈理逝世百周年
    史东山
    尼古拉·伐昔莱维奇·果戈理是俄国伟大文学家之一。他“是普希金的朋友、学生、和继承者，是他那个时代最先进的人们的精神战友……艺术家果戈理虽然与民主主义革命者的观点有许多分歧，但是他是他们的强有力的精神上的同盟者”（见一九五二、一、一七，苏联“文学报”）。他曾经被誉为现实主义文艺的奠基者之一。那一个时期，在俄国，凡作家中表现有现实主义创作风格的，人们都称之为“果戈理倾向”，甚至曾经把这一时期称之为“俄国文学的果戈理时期”（见何家槐译：“论俄国作家”中席达诺夫所作的“论果戈理”一文）。他有着一般伟大文学家所有的观察现实的锐利目光，也有他自己独特的艺术才能，尖锐、幽默而机智的表现手法。
    过去在国民党反动统治时期，当反动派嚣张，对人民进行残酷压迫的时候，许多进步的戏剧电影工作者苦思焦虑地想用什么来突破那种低沉的气压，常常很自然地就想到了果戈理和他的作品，要向他学习。
    果戈理曾用了极其巧妙的表现手法突破当时帝俄“官厅”的检查，发表了他的具有强烈斗争作用的作品“钦差大臣”（或译“巡按”），并且演出了（一八三六年春首次在彼得堡的亚力山特林斯基剧场演出，接着在莫斯科的小剧场演出）。
    “钦差大臣”深刻而尖锐地揭露了帝俄官场中的积弊——公然贪污纳贿，和一些“官吏”的昏庸暴虐、荒淫无耻的生活状态，以及商人行贿等情形。他所描写的人物，都是真实而生动的，不但令当时的俄国人感觉到“随时都可能在他们的亲友或邻人中遇见这类人物”（见“死魂灵”序言中所谈“钦差大臣”一节），而且，凡是在封建阶级和资产阶级所统治的国家里，读者或观众看到了这个剧，也都会有同样的感觉，果戈理笔下人物的那些丑态，在那些国家的统治者当中也同样地存在着。伟大的俄国的批评家柏林斯基说：“果戈理作品中的讽刺是具有世界意义的”，这评价是不错的。
    中国在一九三五年间，第一次在上海演出了果戈理的“钦差大臣”。尽管剧中所描写的是帝俄官场的事情，许多风俗习惯都和中国不同，甚至剧词的翻译有很多别扭之处，但当时也已经能够使观众感觉这个剧本的力量，果戈理的讽刺对于中国的社会同样也有其现实意义，起了相当大的作用。
    当时上海的戏剧界曾以“上海业余剧人协会”的名义演出了“钦差大臣”而打下了过去从未有过的比较巩固的事业基础，从而使那时文化比较集中的上海的戏剧运动更加活跃起来。
    此后，果戈理的剧作在中国各地演出，都为观众所热烈欢迎。果戈理也曾经是中国人民心灵上的同盟者和战友。
    凭借了“钦差大臣”在舞台上演出的成就，我曾经把它改编为电影，名为“狂欢之夜”（并由原来舞台剧的演员来担任表演）。在电影的演出上，曾把故事和人物改为中国的，把舞台剧所局限的、不得不借人物的对白来叙述或描写的许多情节和现象，都正面用场面表现出来，并且把剧词作了一番“中国语言化”的工作，而尽可能地保留着原作的精神和意味。这部影片在各地公映时，也同样收到了很好的效果。后来的三四年里，还在各地电影院中反复上映，随着国民党反动统治的日益趋于腐朽，而使这部影片在反复上映时所产生的效果也愈益强烈。
    果戈理的作品，和其他俄国先进的文艺作品一样，在中国的读者，特别是文艺工作者当中是有着深刻的影响的。

    果戈理对于文艺创作的认真不苟、虚心接受批评和勇敢改正自己错误的精神，也是我们学习的好榜样。据“果戈理是怎样写作的”书中所记，他曾经好几次烧掉他在朋友面前证明并未达到他理想程度的作品。鲁迅先生在“死魂灵”第二部残稿译后记中也谈到：“死魂灵”“第二部完成后，他竟连自己也不相信了自己，在临终前烧掉。”
    在果戈理一生的创作活动中，一贯地表现着他那种重视批评的态度。他曾经写信给朋友说：“谁热中于自己作品中的美点，他就看不见缺点，而且失去了一切。若被激怒，那就是说，别人努力在我们身上挖掘一切的污渣，把它那样明显地暴露了出来，我们便非得看看清楚这污渣是什么不可”，他说：“激怒是没有用处的”。所以他的作品一发表，总要写信给朋友们，要求给予他最严格的批评，说“对我，总应该比对别人说得更多些，需要更多指出我的缺点”。他听朋友们对他的作品加以赞美的时候，他总要说：“……可是，那些不应当赞成的地方呢……你不能把它们指出来吗？”当他的作品“钦差大臣”已经受到读者和观众热烈欢迎的时候，他还写信给朋友说：“如果严格地、正确地研究一下我在以前所写的一切，我觉得，好像翻阅着学生的或自己旧时的练习本，在那里面这一页是由于怠惰，白费了时光，另一页是由于躁急和潦草，是初学者懦怯的手和顽皮者大胆的恶习。”这样的认真、虚心并乐于接受别人批评的精神，无疑是果戈理之所以产生伟大作品的一种因素。
    据最近苏联“文学报”的报道：果戈理有一千多封书信，都要放在他的全集里出版，我想这一定是很有益于我们学习的。
    果戈理曾经在给他朋友的书信中写道：
     “我们被召到世界上来，完全不是为了佳节和
    酒宴，我们是被召到这里来斗争的。因此，我们
    一瞬也不应该忘记我们是走进了战场，而且在这
    里，不可以单单选择较少危险的地带，而应该像
    一个好的战士，把我们的一切投到那斗争正剧烈
    的地方去。”——果戈理所写的这一段话，是更值得我们永远引为教训的。
