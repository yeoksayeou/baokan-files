Reactions to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions to the People's Daily

Li Guangjun, Former Manager of the North China District Company of China National Oils & Fats Corporation, Conducts a Self-Criticism of Bureaucratic Work Style

Editor: The criticism made by Comrade Gao Jian in the People's Daily on December 12, 1951, regarding Shang Qingming's embezzlement, bribery, and theft of secrets at the North China District Company of China National Oils & Fats Corporation, and the serious bureaucratic behavior of the company's leading cadres, is entirely correct. I once served as the manager of the North China District Company and should conduct a deep self-criticism.

Shang Qingming was a retained employee. After becoming the business secretary of the North China District Company, he claimed to be an "expert in oilseed management," did not participate in political studies, and often said he would "resign." The masses were very dissatisfied with his arrogant attitude. Due to our serious bureaucratic tendencies as leaders, we mistakenly believed that the business would be "significantly affected" if we left Shang Qingming, so we did not seriously address his problems. He repeatedly colluded with private merchants, embezzled, and accepted bribes. He was a capitalist mole lurking in state-owned enterprises, a thief who stole state assets, but we in leadership still used methods such as improving his living standards and accommodating him in everything to "unite" with him. From this incident, it is sufficient to prove that I lost vigilance against the frantic attack of the bourgeoisie on state-owned enterprises. I had serious right-leaning thoughts, lacked a pure technical viewpoint based on the working class, and blindly trusted unreformed "experts," which resulted in serious losses to state assets. I should take this incident as a painful lesson.

Reply from the Beijing Slaughterhouse Management Office Regarding Bai Jinming's Suppression of Whistleblowing

Editor: The People's Daily published readers' criticisms on January 25th regarding the suppression of workers' whistleblowing by Bai Jinming, a cadre in our office. We sincerely accept this criticism. In addition to conducting a deep self-criticism of this matter, we have now suspended Bai Jinming from his duties, ordered him to reflect, and organized an inspection team to conduct an in-depth investigation and handling of Bai Jinming's problems. We must thoroughly remove the stumbling blocks in the anti-corruption movement.

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    中国油脂公司华北区公司前经理
    李光军检讨官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：一九五一年十二月十二日人民日报登载的高检同志对中国油脂公司华北区公司尚庆铭贪污受贿盗窃机密，公司领导干部表现了严重的官僚主义的批评，是完全正确的。我曾经担任过该公司华北区公司的经理，应该深刻检讨。
    尚庆铭是留用人员。他任华北区公司业务秘书后，自称是“经营油料的专家”，不参加政治学习，常把“辞职不干”的话挂在嘴边。群众对他这种傲慢的态度，非常不满。由于我们领导方面有严重的官僚主义，错误地认为离开了尚庆铭，业务上“要受重大影响”，所以没有认真解决他的问题。他一再勾结私商、贪污受贿，他是资本家潜伏在国营企业中的坐探、盗窃国家资财的蟊贼，但我们领导方面仍然用提高生活待遇和遇事迁就的方法来“团结”他。从这一事件，足可证明我对资产阶级向国营企业的猖狂进攻失掉警惕。我有着严重的右倾思想，缺乏依靠工人阶级的单纯技术观点，盲目信任没有改造过的“专家”，以致使国家资财受到严重的损失。对这一事件，我应该引为惨痛的教训。
