(Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 29th) According to Bao Lila (Army Number 30449984), a corporal rifleman of the 3rd Platoon, 9th Company, 3rd Battalion, 65th Regiment of the US aggressor army's Infantry 3rd Division, who was captured in mid-January of this year on a highland south of Saknyong on the western front, the enemy troops had been universally injected with cholera, typhoid and paratyphoid, smallpox, and tetanus vaccines before December of last year. In December, they were also injected with a type of vaccine. At that time, the enemy officers and doctors refused to tell the soldiers the name and efficacy of the medicine. This injection was exceptionally not recorded on the "Immunization Registration Certificate" issued to the soldiers. Therefore, the soldiers called this injection a "secret vaccination." According to White (Army Number 22441410), a rifleman of the 2nd Company of the Leicester Regiment of the 29th Brigade of the British accomplice army, who was captured on a hill north of Gorampo-ri on the western front on March 1, the British troops also received this "secret vaccination" in December of last year. At that time, White saw two soldiers refuse to be injected because they did not understand why they were being injected at this time and the efficacy of the injected medicine, but they were forced to be injected by the officers. White also said that the reaction after this injection was very strong. Of the 33 people in his platoon, 23 had symptoms such as numbness in their limbs and dizziness. Now White and Bao Lila have suddenly realized and unanimously said: "Now we understand that the 'secret vaccination' was originally to prevent the US government from conducting germ warfare."

　　Bao Lila also confessed that since December of last year, his unit has been continuously strengthening its epidemic prevention equipment. For example, in December of last year, the soldiers were issued with many types of anti-bacterial drugs, and in January, the soldiers were issued with light green gauze to be used as head covers. According to Bao Lila, since January of this year, his officers have often asked the soldiers to pay attention to hygiene, wash their faces and hands with a yellow liquid every morning, and spray the trenches with a nasal spray every two or three days.

    美英侵略军曾打“秘密防疫针”为进行细菌战作准备
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十九日电】据本年一月中旬在西线朔宁以南一个高地被俘的美国侵略军步兵第三师六五团三营九连三排下士步枪手包里拉（军号三零四四九九八四）供称，该部敌军在去年十二月份以前就普遍注射霍乱、正副伤寒、天花、破伤风等预防针，在十二月间还注射了一种防疫针。当时，敌军军官和医生不肯把药剂的名称和效用告诉士兵。这次注射，破例地没有填写在发给士兵的“免疫登记证”上。因此，士兵称这次注射为“秘密防疫针”。据三月一日在西线高浪浦里以北一个山头上被俘的英国帮凶军二十九旅莱斯特团二连步枪手怀特（军号二二四四一四一零）供称，英国部队里在去年十二月也注射过这种“秘密防疫针”。当时，怀特看见有两个士兵因为不明白为什么要在这个时候注射和注射药剂的效用而拒绝注射，但他们被军官强迫注射了。怀特还说，这次注射后的反应是很大的，他排里三十三个人，就有二十三个人有四肢麻木和头晕等情形。现在怀特和包里拉都恍然大悟，一致说：“现在我们明白了打‘秘密防疫针’，原来是为了预防美国政府进行细菌战的。”
    包里拉并供称，他所在部队从去年十二月以来，不断增强防疫设备，如去年十二月曾发给士兵许多种类的防菌药品，一月份又发给士兵淡绿色纱布作头罩。据包里拉说，他所在部队从今年一月份开始，他的军官便经常要士兵们注意卫生，每天早晨还要用一种黄色药水洗脸、洗手，并每隔两三天就用的的涕喷射一次阵地。
