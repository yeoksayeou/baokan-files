    Anhui University Forestry Department Head Wu Qingquan
    Self-Criticism of Wrong Attitude Towards Criticism and Guarantee to Strive to Transform Thought
    Editor: The People's Daily published two letters from readers on January 9th and February 12th, respectively, criticizing certain teachers at Anhui University. Because this criticism involves issues in the Forestry Department, I would like to make a self-criticism of these errors. The opinions raised by student Zhao Xingliang are basically correct. However, because I lacked a correct understanding of criticism and self-criticism and adopted a “harmony at all costs” attitude towards the teachers in the department, instead of "uniting them with principle and struggle," some teachers grumbled after seeing the criticism published in the People's Daily. I myself did not adopt a correct attitude to deal with this problem, but instead blamed student Zhao Xingliang. This is completely an ugly “patriarchal” style and a wrong attitude towards criticism and self-criticism.
    Since liberation, I have only been concerned with fighting for funds and adding teaching equipment, while neglecting ideological reform and ideological leadership. Therefore, the work of teaching reform has not been done well in our department. Our course content is still mostly the capitalist set; our teaching methods are still the old "spoon-feeding" teaching methods, and we have not paid attention to the students' ability to accept knowledge. We have not given enough importance to the ideological remolding of teachers; in the past, we did not adequately recognize the political significance of ideological remolding of intellectuals as an important condition for the country to gradually realize democratic reform and industrialization. What is even more erroneous is that I treated ideological remolding and learning with an attitude of resistance. Today, I realize the serious harm of bourgeois ideology. I have guaranteed to all members of Anhui University that from today onwards, I will honestly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to eliminate my various erroneous views and incorrect thoughts. I sincerely accept the criticism and help of all members of Anhui University.
    Wu Qingquan, Head of the Forestry Department, Anhui University

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    安徽大学森林系主任吴清泉
    检讨对待批评的错误态度保证努力改造思想
    编辑同志：人民日报一月九日和二月十二日先后发表了两篇读者来信，对安徽大学某些教师提出了批评。因为这一批评涉及森林系的问题，所以我愿检讨这些错误。赵兴梁同学提出的意见，基本上是正确的。但是由于我对批评与自我批评缺乏正确的认识，对系内的教师只是采取“一团和气”的态度，而不是“有原则有斗争地去团结”他们，某些教师看到人民日报上发表的批评信以后，就发牢骚，而我自己也没有采取正确的态度去处理这个问题，反而责备赵兴梁同学。这完全是一种丑恶的“家长制”作风，是错误地对待批评与自我批评的态度。
    解放以来，我只知争经费，添置教学设备，而忽略了思想改造和思想领导，因此教学改革的工作，在我系里一直都没有做好。我们的课程内容，还多半是资产阶级的一套；我们的教学方式，仍旧是“填鸭式”的旧教学方式，我们没有注意同学们的接受能力。对教师的思想改造，我们还没有予以足够的重视；对知识分子思想改造是国家逐步实现民主改革和工业化的重要条件的政治意义，过去也认识不够。更错误的是，我以抗拒的态度来对待思想改造学习。今天，我认识到资产阶级思想的严重危害性。我已向安徽大学全体人员保证，从今天起，我要老老实实地学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，运用批评和自我批评的武器，肃清我的各种错误观点和不正确思想。我诚恳地接受安徽大学全体人员对我的批评和帮助。
    安徽大学森林系系主任  吴清泉
