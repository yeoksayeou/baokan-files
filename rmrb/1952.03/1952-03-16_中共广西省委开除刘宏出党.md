    Party Life
    The CCP Guangxi Provincial Committee has expelled Liu Hong, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Guangxi Provincial Committee, from the Party for corruption, violation of laws and discipline, failure to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and obstruction of the anti-corruption movement. The CCP Guangxi Provincial Committee has decided, with the approval of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau and the Central South Bureau, to remove Liu Hong from his position as Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department and to expel him from the Party.
    Liu Hong was a veteran cadre who had participated in the revolution for twenty years. After entering the city two years ago, he succumbed to the assault of bourgeois sugar-coated bullets and degenerated. According to available materials: In January 1951, Liu Hong instructed Gao Yihong, acting secretary of the Propaganda Department of the Guangxi Provincial Committee, and Xu Zhongjie, accountant, to alter receipts and embezzle 100.2 million yuan from the Propaganda Department's operational funds for 1950, of which Liu Hong personally pocketed 34.5 million yuan. In June 1951, he embezzled 9.55 million yuan from the Guangxi Provincial People's Government Press and Publication Office by means of false transfers. Since April 1950, Liu Hong has continuously extorted private merchants for his own extravagance. Su Dexin, manager of Nanning Xinhua Tobacco Shop, alone gave him 5.9 million yuan on several occasions. A Shanghai merchant, Hu, gave him two taels of gold. He frequently went in and out of restaurants, tea houses, and bathhouses with illegal capitalists.
    In order to satisfy his personal enjoyment, Liu Hong disregarded the law and embezzled 1.7 billion yuan of the Party's propaganda funds, sending people to Shanghai and Hong Kong to do business, and opening canteens, ice-making rooms and other shops in Nanning. The "enterprised" People's Peking Opera Troupe, which he founded under his leadership, cost 450 million yuan, but was a complete failure. Several embezzlers were found in the printing factory and paper mill under his leadership. The Guangxi Provincial Committee Propaganda Department under his leadership wasted more than 120 million yuan.
    Because Liu Hong was only concerned with how to make money for his own extravagance, he had no interest in political life, which led to serious errors in distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves. The people he usually trusted and approached were mostly capitalists and some unscrupulous people. His most trusted cadres were the embezzler Gao Yihong, and Qian Yaohua, the son of a capitalist who had worked in a German firm and owned a pharmacy in Shanghai. Liu Hong appointed Qian Yaohua as the manager of the printing factory under his leadership, and sent him and Gao Yihong to Shanghai with more than 300 million yuan to do business for him. Qian and Gao embezzled and squandered a total of 60 million yuan in Shanghai. When they returned, Liu Hong even helped them alter receipts and reimburse them from public funds. Last year, Liu Hong came to Beijing to attend a meeting. After the meeting, he did not immediately return to the province to convey the spirit of the meeting and arrange work, but went to Shanghai to play and do business, and met some unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai.
    Liu Hong rarely cared about the Party's propaganda work. He usually did not study, and rarely read instructions and documents from higher authorities. He rarely attended meetings convened by the Provincial Committee. In the past two years, he has not personally written any instructions or work reports, nor has he written any articles for newspapers and periodicals. He rarely studied propaganda work, so he could not offer any opinions on the work.
    After discovering Liu Hong's serious errors of losing his stance, misappropriating public funds, and violating laws and discipline, the CCP Guangxi Provincial Committee has continuously educated him, but he only superficially accepted criticism, and in fact obeyed in public and opposed in private, refusing to correct his errors. In the autumn of 1951, when the Provincial Committee inspected the use of propaganda funds, Liu Hong used false accounts to deceive the organization. After the start of this anti-corruption movement, he not only did not confess his mistakes to the Party, but also systematically concealed his crimes. Each of his self-criticisms avoided the important and emphasized the trivial, and he and his accomplices in embezzlement formed an "alliance of offense and defense," attempting to resist the anti-corruption movement. Although Liu Hong was once a veteran cadre, a twenty-year-old Communist Party member, he had long since completely lost the noble qualities of a glorious Communist Party member, and had completely degenerated and deteriorated politically. Therefore, the Party must purge him.

### 中共广西省委开除刘宏出党

    中共广西省委开除刘宏出党
    中共广西省委宣传部副部长刘宏，贪污腐化、违法乱纪、敌我不分，阻挠反贪污运动。中共广西省委已决定并经中共中央华南分局和中南局批准，撤销刘宏宣传部副部长的职务，并开除其党籍。
    刘宏是参加革命二十年的老干部。入城两年来，由于经不起资产阶级糖衣炮弹的袭击而蜕化变质。据已有材料：一九五一年一月，刘宏授意广西省委宣传部代理秘书高以洪、会计徐仲杰涂改单据，贪污一九五零年宣传部事业费一亿零二百万元，刘宏个人分得赃款三千四百五十万元。一九五一年六月，又以假转账目的方式，贪污广西省人民政府新闻出版处事业费九百五十五万元。自一九五零年四月以来，刘宏不断向私商勒索，供自己挥霍，仅南宁市新华菸庄经理苏德新先后就给他五百九十万元。上海商人胡寄给他黄金二两。他经常和违法资本家进出饭馆、茶店、澡堂。
    刘宏为了满足个人的享乐生活，竟无法无天地挪用党的宣传事业费十七亿元，派人到上海、香港作生意，并在南宁开办了食堂、制冰室等店铺。在他领导下所创办的“企业化”的人民京剧团，花费了四亿五千万元，结果完全失败；他领导下的印刷厂和纸厂，发现了好些贪污分子；他领导的广西省委宣传部，浪费一亿二千余万元。
    由于刘宏所关心的只是如何搞钱来供他个人挥霍，所以对政治生活毫无兴趣，以致发生了敌我不分的严重错误。他平常所信任的和所接近的也多是些资本家和一些不正派的人。他最亲信的干部就是贪污分子高以洪，和曾在德国商行当过职员、在上海开有药房的资本家的儿子钱耀华。刘宏任命钱耀华到他所领导的印刷厂当经理，派他和高以洪携带三亿余元赴上海替他做生意。钱、高两人在上海贪污挥霍共六千万元，回来时，刘宏竟帮助他们涂改单据，向公家报销。去年，刘宏来北京参加会议，会后，他不立即回省传达会议的精神和布置工作，却到上海去游玩和做生意，并在上海结识了一些奸商。
    刘宏很少关心党的宣传事业。平时他不学习，连上级的指示和文件也极少阅读。省委召开的会议，他也很少参加。两年来，他没有亲自写过指示和工作报告，也没有给报纸刊物写过文章。他很少研究宣传工作，因此对工作也提不出什么意见。
    对于刘宏的丧失立场、挪用公款、违法乱纪的严重错误，中共广西省委发现后，曾对他不断地进行了教育，但他只是在表面上接受批评，实则阳奉阴违，不肯改正错误。一九五一年的秋季，省委检查宣传事业费的使用时，刘宏竟用假账来欺骗组织。在这次反贪污运动开始后，他不但不向党坦白认错，反而有计划地隐瞒罪行。他的每一次检讨，都是避重就轻，并且和同谋的贪污分子订立了“攻守同盟”，妄图对抗反贪污运动。刘宏虽曾是一个老干部，一个二十年的老共产党员，但他早已完全丧失了一个光荣的共产党员的高贵品质，在政治上完全堕落变质了。因此，党必须把他清洗出去。
