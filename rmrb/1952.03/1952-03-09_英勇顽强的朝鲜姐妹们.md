    Heroic and Tenacious Korean Sisters
    Wu Ming
    The day before the "March 8th" International Women's Day last year, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced the heroic deeds of Zhao Yuji, the "Republic's First Female Hero." Zhao Yuji was originally the chairman of the Women's League in Bicheng County. When the enemy occupied Bicheng, she organized a guerrilla force and fought the enemy day and night in the Zhi'nan Mountain area of ​​Huanghae Province. In one battle in early November 1950 alone, she personally killed six American soldiers. On November 15th, the enemy launched a large-scale "suppression" against them. After inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, she ran out of bullets and stabbed several more enemies with her bayonet. She was unfortunately captured. The enemy used all kinds of torture to interrogate her, cruelly pulling out her fingernails and toenails, gouging out her eyes, cutting off her nose and breasts, whipping her, and branding her with hot irons, leaving her whole body covered in festering wounds, but she never yielded. When the enemy dragged her to the execution ground, she shouted "Long live General Kim Il-sung!" "The final victory will surely belong to the glorious and righteous Korean people!" and calmly met her death.
    Hero Zhao Yuji sacrificed herself heroically, but millions of Korean women more bravely took up arms and fought with the American invading army. When the enemy occupied Huanghae Province, a guerrilla force of hundreds of Korean women led by Kim Myung-hee and Park Young-sil appeared in the Jiuyue Mountain area. Among them was a young girl named Yin Wenzhen. When the enemy invaded northern Korea, she was arrested many times in enemy-occupied cities. The enemy used all kinds of threats and inducements against her, but could not make her yield. The last time she was arrested, on a snowy night, the enemy dragged her to a mountain, preparing to shoot her. But when the enemy flashed to her side and was about to raise his gun, she suddenly jumped off a cliff into a deep valley. The branches of the deep valley caught her and prevented her from being killed. She found the guerrillas that night, and from then on she became an excellent guerrilla fighter. In the guerrillas' more than twenty battles, she made meritorious contributions every time. Once, she participated in a suicide squad in the assault team, leading three members of the Democratic Youth League in a surprise attack on an enemy artillery position, destroying the enemy's artillery and capturing several enemy prisoners, including the artillery commander. Later, when this guerrilla force, mostly composed of women, liberated Zaining City, Yin Wenzhen had become the leader of an assault team.
    There are countless female heroes in the People's Army. Among them are the famous female pilot Tai Shanhui, the "Republic's Female Hero" who has bombed enemy bases many times and made great achievements; and Li Xiude, the "Republic's Female Hero" who was a sharpshooter before the war and became a famous sharpshooter after the war began. Before the end of 1950, Li Xiude had eliminated more than eighty American and Li bandits alone and captured two cars. Later, she and her husband, Li Moyi, the winner of the Second Class National Flag Medal, ambushed on a highway and killed more than seventy enemies fleeing south from the highway. The couple always followed the People's Army in battle and became a famous "hero couple" in Korea.
    There are a large number of female nurses in the People's Army. They rescued the wounded on the front lines, braving gunfire. Li Shunren, a female nurse and "Republic's Female Hero" who won the First Class National Flag Medal, repeatedly rescued the wounded from the flames of enemy bombing, regardless of her own burns. On the Han River front, Li Shunren gave blood transfusions to three wounded soldiers in a row. When she was giving blood to the last wounded soldier, she almost fainted. The wounded soldier grabbed her hand, his face full of tears, and refused to let her give any more blood. But she said: "I am a nurse in the People's Army, and it is my duty to find every possible way to save a bravely wounded comrade. You can contribute your precious life for us, and I should contribute my blood to you!" This female hero has transfused 1,700 cc of her own blood to the wounded. She is known as the "Mother of the Wounded" in the hospital.
    After the men in various rear positions went to the front lines, the heroic Korean women took over their work. Sixty percent of the workers in the heavy industry sectors of Korea are now female workers. Female coal miner Jin Yucen's work efficiency is 60% higher than that of men before the war. Female train driver Park Young-sil also overfulfilled her task in 1951.
    Women in rural areas overcame the difficulties of manpower, animal power, and farming tools, braved enemy planes' day and night raids, and rebuilt their homes on the ruins created by the enemy. Jin Zuoqi, whose father was killed by the enemy, is only a nineteen-year-old girl. She cultivated all the land that her father used to cultivate, and harvested twenty-nine more straw bags of rice than in previous years. She first paid the public grain and donated the twenty-nine extra bags of rice to the state as "patriotic grain." She also organized a weeding team of more than forty people to cultivate land for the families of martyrs and soldiers. In the rural areas of Korea, there are thousands of female labor models like Jin Zuoqi everywhere.
    Women in other jobs also enthusiastically dedicate their blood and sweat to the country. Not long after the outbreak of the war, the "Mother" and "Women" airplanes donated by Korean women appeared in the skies over Korea, and female pilots bravely charged into the American bandits.

    英勇顽强的朝鲜姐妹们
    吴明
    去年“三八”国际妇女节的前一天，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府公布了“共和国第一名女英雄”赵玉姬的英勇事迹。赵玉姬原是碧城郡女盟委员长。当敌人侵占碧城时，她组织了游击队，在黄海道的支南山一带不分昼夜地打击着敌人。仅在一九五零年十一月初的一次战斗中，她就亲手打死了六个美国兵。十一月十五日，敌人用大批兵力向他们进行“讨伐”，她在给予敌人重大杀伤之后，子弹打光了，又用刺刀刺死了好几个敌人，最后不幸被俘。敌人用尽一切严刑来拷问她，残忍地拔下了她的手脚指甲，挖下了她的眼睛，削去了她的鼻子和乳房，皮鞭抽打、火棍烧烙，使她全身无一处不是烂肉，但她始终没有屈服。敌人把她拉上刑场的时候，她高呼着“金日成将军万岁”“最后胜利一定属于光荣正义的朝鲜人民”，从容就义。
    英雄赵玉姬壮烈地牺牲了，但千百万朝鲜妇女却更英勇地拿起了武器，和美国侵略军拚杀起来。敌人侵占黄海道时，在九月山一带出现了一支由金明姬和朴永实所领导的数百名朝鲜妇女组织的游击队。其中有一位年青的尹稳全姑娘，敌人侵入朝鲜北部时，她在敌人占领的城市中曾多次被捕，敌人曾对她施以各种威胁利诱，都不能使她屈服。她最后一次在被捕时，在一个下雪的夜晚，敌人把她拉到一座山上，准备要枪杀她。但当敌人闪到她的身旁刚想举枪的时候，她猛然纵身跳下悬崖深谷。深谷的树枝把她挂住没有摔死。她连夜找到了游击队，从此她就成了一名优秀的游击队员，在游击队二十多次战斗中，每一次她都建立了功勋。有一次她参加了冲击队里的决死组，带领三个民青队员，奇袭敌人一个炮兵阵地，将敌人的大炮摧毁，捉回敌军炮长以下数名俘虏。后来这个大部分是妇女组成的游击队解放载宁城时，尹稳全已经成了一个冲击队的领导者。
    在人民军中更有无数的女英雄。其中著名的有多次轰炸敌人基地、战功卓著的女飞行员、“共和国女英雄”太善姬；在战前是百发百中的女猎手，战争开始后成为著名射击手的“共和国女英雄”李秀德。一九五零年底以前，李秀德一个人就先后消灭了八十多名美李匪军，缴获了两辆汽车。后来她又和她的丈夫——二级国旗勋章的获得者李沫一，两人埋伏在一条公路旁，打死了从公路上向南逃跑的七十多个敌人。夫妻二人始终跟随人民军战斗着，成为朝鲜著名的“英雄夫妇”。
    人民军中有大批的女护士。她们在火线上，冒着枪林弹雨抢救伤员。荣获一级国旗勋章的女护士、“共和国女英雄”李顺任，曾屡次从敌人轰炸的烈火中，不顾自己烧伤的身体，把伤员抢救出来。在汉江前线，李顺任一连给三个伤员输血。当她输血给最后一个伤员时，几乎要晕倒了。伤员拉住她的手，脸上挂满了泪，无论如何不叫她再输血了。但她说：“我是人民军的护士，想一切办法来救活一个英勇负伤的同志是我的责任。你为了我们能贡献你宝贵的生命，我应该把我的血贡献给你！”这位女英雄前后已输出了自己的鲜血一千七百西西给伤员。她在医院中被称为“伤员之母”。
    各个后方工作岗位上的男子奋身走上前线以后，英勇的朝鲜妇女就接替了他们的工作。朝鲜的重工业部门里做工的，现在有百分之六十是女工。女挖煤手金玉琛，工作效率比战前男子还高百分之六十。女火车司机朴永实，在一九五一年也超额完成了任务。
    在农村中的妇女，克服了人力、畜力、耕具的困难，冒着敌机日夜袭扰，在敌人造成的废墟上重建家园。父亲被敌人杀死的金作姬，是一个才只有十九岁的少女。她耕种了过去父亲所种的全部土地，收获的大米比往年多了二十九草袋。她首先缴纳了公粮，并把增产的二十九袋大米作为“爱国粮”捐献给国家。她还组织了四十多个人的锄田队，为烈属军属代耕。农闲的时候，她就发动全村的妇女去修公路、架桥。在朝鲜的农村中，到处都有千百个金作姬一样的女劳动模范。
    在其他工作岗位上的妇女们，也同样热烈地把自己的血汗献给国家。战争爆发不久，朝鲜上空就出现了由朝鲜妇女捐献的“母亲号”“妇女号”飞机，由女飞行员们驾驶着向美国强盗英勇冲杀。
