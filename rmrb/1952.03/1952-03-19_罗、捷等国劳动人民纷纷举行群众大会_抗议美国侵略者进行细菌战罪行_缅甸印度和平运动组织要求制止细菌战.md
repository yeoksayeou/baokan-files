Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: The broad masses of people in countries such as Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia have expressed their indignant protests against the crimes of American aggressors in conducting bacteriological warfare.

According to a report by the Telecommunications Agency on the 17th: Mass rallies have been held in various parts of Romania. Workers, technicians, staff, scientists, and artists have unanimously condemned the American cannibals who use bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. A grand protest rally was held in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, on the 14th. Stakhanovite worker Hidiq of the "Suro Tractor Factory" denounced the crimes of the American aggressors, expressing the indignation of all the workers in the factory. Workers in Croche, Prosh, and other cities have also demanded the cessation of bacteriological warfare and the end of the Korean War. Bucharest University passed a similar resolution of protest on the 15th.

According to a TASS dispatch from Tirana on the 16th: The working people of Albania have held rallies to protest against the crimes of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons. Workers at a large rice cleaning factory under construction in Vlorë telegraphed to the Albanian Peace Committee, saying: The American imperialists have used bacteriological weapons in an attempt to thwart the determination of the heroic Korean people who are fighting for freedom and national independence. We protest against this heinous crime of the American imperialists with deep hatred and indignation.

The Bulgarian National Peace Committee has received hundreds of telegrams from the working people of Sofia, Plovdiv, Stalin City, and other cities protesting against the American bacteriological warfare. Women in Pleven telegraphed: We feel extremely angry and despise the barbaric atrocities committed by the American bandits in Korea. We firmly support the views of world public opinion, demanding an immediate end to the war in Korea and severely punishing the executioners who slaughtered the Korean people. On the 17th, Bulgarian newspapers published cartoons depicting Truman sending fleas, lice, and rats as loyal allies, carrying deadly bacteria to Korea to kill innocent women and children.

Telecommunications Agency reported on the 17th: The Czechoslovak Catholic Priests for Peace Committee has sent a protest telegram to the United Nations. The telegram quoted the Bible: "By their fruits ye shall know them." The telegram pointed out: These fruits show that all the false words of the American aggressors and their claim that they are "defending Christian civilization" are nothing but despicable lies, and they are abusing religion to achieve evil purposes.

Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: TASS dispatch from Prague: The various parties and organizations affiliated to the Czech and Slovak National Front issued a joint statement on March 15, protesting against the crimes of American imperialism in using bacteriological weapons.

The statement said: Since January this year, the American interventionist army in Korea has been using bacteriological weapons against the brave Korean people who are fighting heroically for the freedom and independence of their country. The people of Czechoslovakia feel infinite indignation upon hearing the news of this latest crime by the American army. Since February this year, the American interventionist army has expanded the scope of the use of bacteriological weapons and has even spread poisonous insects within the borders of Northeast China. In this way, the American interventionists have taken another aggressive step, intending to launch a war of aggression against the peace-loving Chinese people.

The heinous crime committed by American imperialism is an extremely serious violation of all the principles of international law, especially the Geneva Protocol, which prohibits the use of bacteriological weapons and determines that the use of bacteriological weapons is the most serious crime against humanity, violating human morality and conscience.

The statement added: The people of Czechoslovakia feel the same indignation as the people of Korea and China at the crimes of the American imperialists. The American imperialists have once again exposed themselves as the deadly enemies of mankind.

The statement said: We, the people of Czechoslovakia, together with all honest people in the world, demand the immediate cessation of the criminal bacteriological warfare in Korea, the severe punishment of the initiators and organizers of bacteriological warfare, and the immediate cessation of the Korean War and the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement.

The statement was signed by the Central Action Committee of the National Front, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak Socialist Party, the People's Party, the Liberal Party, the Slovak Revival Party, the Czechoslovak Peace Committee, the Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions, the Czechoslovak Youth League, the Czechoslovak Women's Federation, the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Association, the Anti-Fascist Fighters League, the Central Council of Czechoslovak Cooperatives, and the Czechoslovak Red Cross.

Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: Rangoon News: The Burma World Peace Congress recently issued a statement strongly protesting against the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, and calling on the Burmese people to unite and take effective measures together with the people of the world to sanction the towering crimes of American imperialism.

U Tin Paw Mun, Vice Chairman of the Burma World Peace Congress, Dr. U Sin Bo, Chairman of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, Ko Na Win, Chairman of the All-Burma Students' Union, and Ko Ei Dan, Chairman of the Marxist-Leninist Research Society, and other prominent social leaders, have all made statements to the press. They pointed out that the American imperialists' spreading of bacteria is a crazy act that violates international conventions and is an enemy of all mankind. It is more brutal than the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists in World War II. They called on peace-loving people all over the world to rise up and stop the atrocities of American imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 18th: Peace movement organizations, various parties, and cultural groups in West Bengal, India, have issued statements protesting against the bacteriological warfare waged by the American aggressors.

The statement called on the United Nations to declare an unconditional ban on bacteriological warfare.

Various parties in West Bengal have protested against this barbaric act of the American imperialists. The secretary of the Indian Communist Party's Bargana County Committee, the secretary of the Forward Bloc (Marxist Group), the secretary of the Forward Bloc (Rikkel Group), and the vice chairman of the Balakpore City (near Calcutta) Municipal Council jointly issued a statement calling on the people to rise up and protest against the atrocities of the American imperialists in conducting bacteriological warfare.

    保加利亚全国和平委员会接到了索非亚、普罗夫的夫、斯大林城以及其他城市劳动人民发来的数百封抗议美国进行细菌战的电报。普勒文的妇女打电报说：我们听到美国匪徒在朝鲜所犯的野蛮暴行，感到非常的愤怒和鄙视。我们坚决赞助世界舆论的主张，要求立刻停止朝鲜的战争，并严厉惩罚屠杀朝鲜人民的刽子手。十七日，保加利亚各报刊载了漫画，描绘杜鲁门把跳蚤、虱子和老鼠作为忠实的盟友，派它们带着致命的细菌到朝鲜去杀害无辜的妇女和儿童。

    美帝国主义进行这种穷凶极恶的罪行，就是极其严重地破坏了国际法的一切原则，特别是日内瓦议定书，这个议定书禁止使用细菌武器，确定使用细菌武器是最严重的反人道的、违反人类的道德和良心的罪行。
