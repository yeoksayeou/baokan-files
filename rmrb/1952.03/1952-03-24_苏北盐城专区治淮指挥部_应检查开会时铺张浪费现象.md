    SuBei Yancheng Special District Huai River Harnessing Headquarters
    Should Investigate Extravagance and Waste During Meetings

    To the Editor: The SuBei Yancheng Special District Huai River Harnessing Headquarters exhibited serious extravagance and waste during the Huai River Harnessing Summary Conference held in January. Before the conference even started, the "SuBei Experimental Peking Opera Troupe" was invited from Yangzhou to perform. It is understood that the troupe's boat fare and performance fees alone cost 25 million yuan, not including the expenses for inviting people to drink and stay in hotels. Some cadres also said: Our special district also has performing arts troupes, why did we have to invite a Peking Opera troupe from so far away? During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, the Special District Huai River Harnessing Headquarters did not investigate this matter. I believe this is an act of extravagance and waste, and I suggest that the Yancheng Special District Huai River Harnessing Headquarters conduct a thorough investigation.

    苏北盐城专区治淮指挥部
    应检查开会时铺张浪费现象
    编辑同志：苏北盐城专区治淮指挥部，在一月份召开治淮总结大会期间，有严重铺张浪费的现象。这次大会开幕前，就从扬州请“苏北实验京剧团”来演京戏。据了解，只剧团的轮船费、演出费就开支了二千五百万元，请喝酒、住旅馆费等还没有计算在内。也有的干部说：我们专区也有文工团，为什么要到远处去请京剧团呢？在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动里面，专区治淮指挥部对这件事并没有进行检查。我认为这是一种铺张浪费行为，建议盐城专区治淮指挥部作深刻的检查。
