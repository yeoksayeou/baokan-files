    How to Carry Out Newspaper Reading Work in Ethnic Minority Areas?
    Introduction to the Experience of the Qinghai Daily in Organizing Newspaper Reading Groups

    The effectiveness and experience of developing newspaper reading groups in Qinghai Province over the past year prove that establishing newspaper reading groups in ethnic minority areas is one of the best forms of carrying out the Party's propaganda and education work. According to incomplete statistics from the Qinghai Province Newspaper Reading Group Leaders' Representative Conference last October, there are a total of 2,663 newspaper reading groups in the province (including some Tibetan newspaper reading groups), with more than 48,000 people participating in listening to the newspaper (this number has now been greatly exceeded). Newspaper reading groups have penetrated factories, rural areas, schools, and temples, and are of concern to people of all ethnic groups.

    How to organize newspaper reading groups in ethnic minority areas? In addition to the experiences of organizing newspaper reading groups in general areas that can be adopted, we have also started this work based on the characteristics of Qinghai, a multi-ethnic region.

    First, consciously cultivate activists among ethnic minorities and mobilize their own people to participate in newspaper reading groups through them.

    Activists among ethnic minorities are familiar with the situation of their own ethnic groups and have close ties with their people. By working through them, newspaper reading groups can be easily established. At last year's newspaper reading group representative meeting, we discovered that Hu Dongzhu (a Lama), a representative of the塔尔寺(Ta'er Temple) newspaper reading group, was very active in the work of the newspaper reading group, so we consciously organized the Ta'er Temple Tibetan newspaper reading group through him. We designated comrades from the Qinghai Tibetan Newspaper to frequently contact him and provide assistance. After he returned, he conveyed the spirit of the newspaper reading group meeting to all the monks of Ta'er Temple and the Tibetan people of Jinta Township, and explained the truth of cultural emancipation, so that everyone realized that only under the leadership of Chairman Mao can they be culturally emancipated. In just one month, four Tibetan newspaper reading groups were formed in Ta'er Temple, and eleven Tibetan newspaper reading groups were organized in Jinta Township under his call. In the past, Hui women rarely went out, making it difficult to organize newspaper reading groups. When we developed newspaper reading groups among women in Dongguan (a Hui-populated area) in Xining City, we received support from the Dongguan Mosque newspaper reading group, and Hui women representatives such as Lei Junqing contacted a group of activists to publicize the program from door to door, persuading parents and husbands in families. As a result, more than 140 Hui women were mobilized to participate in newspaper reading, including Tian Yuzhen, who had not been out of the house for seventeen years.

    Second, respect the customs and habits of ethnic minorities.

    The Hui newspaper reading group outside the East Xiaomen in Xining City had very few people at the beginning; they were also uneasy when listening to the newspaper, standing up and sitting down again. After investigation, we learned that the newspaper reading time conflicted with their prayer time. Later, after everyone's discussion, the newspaper reading time was changed, and more people participated and listened to the newspaper with peace of mind. When the Eighteenth Street of the Third District of Xining City started to organize Hui newspaper reading groups, men and women were grouped together, and many women felt uncomfortable. Later, men and women were separated, and four women's newspaper reading groups were established separately, each with more than 20 people.

    Third, holding a "cultural grievance meeting" is a good way to organize newspaper reading groups.

    This method was created by the masses of Xinyuanbao Village, the second administrative village of Xinyuan Township, the first district of Huzhu County. Last September, Wang Shengzong, the chairman of the farmers' association of the village, and Guo Youbang, a primary school teacher, led a "cultural grievance meeting" of more than 200 people, where the masses told about the painful facts they encountered because they were illiterate to stimulate everyone's class consciousness. Five newspaper reading groups were organized on the spot. Less than a month after the establishment of the newspaper reading groups, they also set up four blackboard newspapers, one cartoon newspaper, one "local broadcasting" station, and an 89-person秧歌(Yangge) team to conduct current affairs policy publicity to the masses in the village and outside the village. Li Shenglian, a family member of a volunteer soldier, recognized more than 300 characters after participating in the newspaper reading group. She happily said: "A cultural grievance meeting cleared my mind. I can now recognize half of the letters from my husband from the Korean front, and I can also write simple replies. In the past, I was illiterate, and when letters came, I ran around asking people for help, which was embarrassing." Now many places in the newspaper reading group have adopted this method, and the effect is very good.

    Fourth, when organizing newspaper reading groups in temples, strive for the sympathy and support of religious leaders to facilitate smooth progress.

    In July of the year before last, when we organized a newspaper reading group in the Dongguan Great Mosque in Xining City, we first persuaded the Imam, Mai Chengzhang, and Changxue and Ahong of the mosque to recognize the benefits of reading newspapers and gain their support. We used the authenticity of the people's newspapers after liberation and the specific facts of serving the people to correct their old idea that "the things in the newspapers cannot be fully believed or not believed." They once actively used the Islamic Juma Day and prayers to publicize to everyone and mobilize Muslims to participate in newspaper reading groups. In May last year, the newspaper reading group of the temple also held a symposium of 58 Ahong to specifically discuss the issue of developing newspaper reading groups, and later continued to establish five newspaper reading groups in Daxue Manla and Middle School Manla. The newspaper reading group of the Qingzhen (Great) Mosque has persisted from July of the year before last until now, and the effect has been great. When Yangjiazhuang in the fourth district of Xining City started to organize newspaper reading groups, Li Cunzhi, the Ahong of the village, was afraid that Hui women would "mess up" by reading newspapers, so he objected and said: "Hui women can do anything, but they absolutely cannot read newspapers." Later, he saw that Hui women in other places had participated in newspaper reading groups and understood more principles, so he corrected his mistaken view and also asked his wife, Sha Fengxiu, who never went out, to participate in the newspaper reading group. Last October, when he went to本省亹源(Wen Yuan) in this province, when he wrote to his family, he also asked his wife to "study well in the newspaper reading group." In November, when his wife asked the newspaper reading group for leave to make cotton clothes for him, he did not agree.

    At present, newspaper reading groups in Qinghai Province are not widespread enough, and some Lama temples and Qingzhen (Great) mosques only have one newspaper reading group. But we believe that in Qinghai, a vast, sparsely populated, culturally underdeveloped multi-ethnic region, especially in the current situation where there is a lack of systematic mass propaganda and education institutions, the development prospects and the role played by newspaper reading groups are unlimited.

    在少数民族地区怎样开展读报工作？
    青海日报组织读报组经验介绍
    青海省一年来发展读报组的效果和经验证明：在少数民族地区，建立读报组，是开展党的宣传教育工作的最好形式之一。根据去年十月间青海省读报组长代表会议的不完全统计，全省共有二千六百六十三个读报组（包括一部分藏文读报组），参加听报的群众达四万八千多人（目前已大大超过此数）。读报组已经深入工厂、农村、学校和寺院里，为各族人民所关心。
    在少报民族地区如何组织读报组呢？除了一般地区组织读报组的经验可供采用外，我们还根据青海这个多民族地区的特点，着手进行这一工作。
    第一、有意识地培养少数民族中的积极分子，通过他们去发动本族人民参加读报组。
    少数民族中的积极分子熟悉本民族的情况，和本民族人民有血肉的联系，通过他们进行工作，读报组容易开展起来。去年读报组代表会议上，我们发现了塔尔寺读报组代表胡栋柱（喇嘛）对读报组工作很积极，就有意识地通过他来组织塔尔寺藏文读报组。指定青海藏文报同志经常和他取得联系并给予帮助。他回去后，向塔尔寺全体僧众和金塔乡的藏民传达了读报组会议的精神，讲解了文化翻身的道理，使大家认识到，只有在毛主席领导下，才能在文化上翻身。短短的一个月中，塔尔寺就组成了四个藏文读报组，金塔乡也在他的号召下，组织了十一个藏民读报组。回族妇女在过去很少出门，组织读报组比较困难。我们在西宁市东关（回族聚居地区）妇女中发展读报组时，由于得到东关清真寺读报组的支持，并由回民妇女代表雷俊卿联系一部分积极分子，挨门逐户地宣传，说服家庭中的父母和丈夫，结果发动了一百四十多名回族妇女参加读报，其中有十七年没有出过门的田育珍。
    第二、要尊重少数民族的风俗习惯
    西宁市东梢门外的回民读报组，开始时人到的很少；听报时也不安心，站起来又坐下。我们经过调查，才知道读报时间和他们的礼拜时间冲突了。后来经过大家讨论，改换了读报时间，参加的人就多起来了，听报也安心了。西宁市三区十八街开始组织回民读报组时，男女合编在一组，很多妇女感到不自在。后来就把男女分开，单独成立了四个妇女读报组，每组都有二十人以上。
    第三、召开“文化诉苦会”，是组织读报组的好方法。
    这个办法是互助县一区新元乡二行政村新元堡群众创造出来的。去年九月，该村分农会主任王生宗和小学教员郭有邦领导召开了一个二百多人的“文化诉苦会”，由群众诉说他（她）们不识字所遭遇的痛苦事实，启发大家的阶级觉悟。当场就组织了五个读报组。读报组成立后还不到一个月，他们又办了四块黑板报、一个漫画报、一个“土广播”台和一个八十九人的秧歌队，经常对本村和外村群众进行时事政策的宣传。志愿军家属李生莲在参加读报组后，认识了三百多字，她高兴地说：“一次文化诉苦会把我脑子洗清了。我丈夫从朝鲜前线来信，现在已能认得一半，还能写简单的回信。过去不识字，来了信，东跑西跑地求人，蛮不好意思。”现在很多地方的读报组，都采用了这个办法，效果很好。
    第四、在寺院中组织读报组，应争取其宗教首领的同情和支持，以便顺利开展。
    前年七月，我们在西宁市东关清真大寺组织读报组时，首先说服了该寺的教长买成章及长学和阿訇等人，使他们认识了读报的好处，取得他们的支持。我们用解放后人民报纸的真实性和为人民服务的具体事实，使他们纠正了“报纸上的东西，不可全信、也不可不信”的旧思想。他们曾主动地利用伊斯兰教的主玛日、礼拜给大家宣传，发动伊斯兰教徒参加读报组。去年五月间，该寺读报组又召开了五十八个阿訇的座谈会，专门讨论发展读报组的问题，后来又继续在大学满拉，中学满拉中建立了五个读报组。清真寺的读报组从前年七月一直坚持到现在，收效很大。西宁市四区杨家庄开始组织读报组时，该村阿訇李存智怕回族妇女读报读“乱了”，因而反对地说：“回族妇女啥都可干，报绝对不能读。”后来他看到其他地方回族妇女都参加了读报组，懂得了更多的道理，就纠正了自己的错误看法，也叫自己从不出门的妻子沙凤秀参加了读报组。去年十月他到了本省亹源，给家中来信时，还叫他妻子“要好好的在读报组里学习”。十一月间他妻子向读报组请假给他做棉衣时，他都不同意。
    目前青海省读报组还不够普遍，有些喇嘛寺、清真寺的读报组还只有一个。但我们相信在青海这样一个地大人稀、文化不发达的多民族地区，特别是在目前尚缺乏系统的群众宣传教育机构的情况下，读报组的发展前途和所起的作用是不可限量的。
