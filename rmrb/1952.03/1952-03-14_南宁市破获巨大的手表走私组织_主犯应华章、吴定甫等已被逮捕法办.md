    Nanning City Cracks Down on Huge Watch Smuggling Organization
    Principal Culprits Ying Huazhang, Wu Dingfu, and Others Have Been Arrested and Brought to Justice
    In the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and theft of state economic intelligence, the industrial and commercial circles of Nanning City, Guangxi Province, have cracked down on a huge watch smuggling organization, and the principal culprits Ying Huazhang, Wu Dingfu, and others have been arrested and brought to justice.
    In watch shops in major cities across the country, there are "French watches." The vast majority of these watches are smuggled in from Vietnam. Nanning is the center of this watch smuggling. According to Nanning Customs estimates, from March to October of last year, approximately 270,000 watches were imported from Vietnam, half of which were smuggled through Guangxi to various parts of the country. Mang Street in Vietnam, still controlled by French imperialism, and Dongxing in Fangcheng County, Guangxi Province, are only separated by a small river. Smugglers hired single-backpack carriers, bought watches, and smuggled them across the border using various methods. Once in Dongxing, they hid them in car tires or under charcoal stoves, stuffed them in cattle horns or crab shells, and used other despicable and filthy methods to transport them to Nanning. Then, through parcels and the hands of some backward railway employees, they were sent to major cities across the country. According to insiders, in Mang Street, one or two taels of gold can buy a dozen high-quality French watches; medium and low-quality watches cost only 60,000 to 80,000 RMB. But in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, each watch generally costs around 500,000 to 600,000 RMB. Because the profit is so high, watch dealers in major cities are all looking towards Nanning.
    Ying Huazhang, a奸商 (cunning merchant) in Nanning City, began engaging in watch smuggling as early as 1947 when he opened Hengdeli Watch Shop. After liberation, he intensified his efforts. Initially, he used backward sailors traveling between Nanning and Guangzhou to smuggle watches from Guangzhou. In the autumn of 1950, he began instructing his younger brother Ying Ying to purchase smuggled French watches in Longzhou, colluding with Cao Zhiping, a driver of the Guangxi Military Region Headquarters, to transport them to Nanning. After the promulgation of the "Measures for the Control of Entry and Exit of the Border Areas of Hong Kong and Macao" in February 1951, these smugglers decided to find new routes. Ying dispatched his accomplice Wu Dingfu, the owner of Hengdali, to Guangzhou to attend a smuggling watch meeting convened by the Da Zhonghua Glasses and Fountain Pen Company (which also dealt in watches), deciding to move the smuggling center to Nanning. After the meeting, Wu immediately telegraphed Ying, "Quickly purchase French watches." After March, the watch smuggling craze intensified. According to Ying's own confession, he smuggled more than 27,000 French watches; the evaded national taxes alone amounted to 8 billion RMB.
    In order to achieve their smuggling goals, these奸商(cunning merchants) did not hesitate to undermine the state's financial policies, purchasing gold from the black market and sending it to French imperialism, as well as engaging in illegal foreign exchange transactions. When Wu Dingfu opened Hengdali Watch Shop in April 1950, he privately exchanged 2,000 Hong Kong dollars and smuggled more than 20 taels of gold through a Catholic priest. The loss of gold and foreign exchange suffered by the state as a result is simply incalculable.
    In order to cover up and direct the smuggling activities of the 行商水客 (traveling merchants and water carriers), Ying, Wu and others colluded with奸商(cunning merchants) Fang Shizhen, Liu Yuesheng, and others to falsely set up Nankai, Heji and other inns, specializing in privately collecting gold, bribing tax officials, buying off car drivers, and contacting smuggling 水客 (water carriers). The Nankai Inn alone controlled more than 100 smuggling 行商 (traveling merchants) in the Qinzhou and Dongxing areas. According to Fang's confession, he himself handled the purchase of more than 10,000 smuggled watches. Liu handled more than 8,000 watches.
    They used shameless means to pull some cadres over to their side in the Tax Bureau and Nanning Customs and other agencies, occupied some strongholds; even the People's Bank of Guangxi Province had their pawns. To avoid inspection, Ying could hand over the smuggled watches to Qian Chengfu, director of the Nanning Second Office of the People's Bank, to be placed in the bank's safe deposit box. This shows how rampant they were.

    南宁市破获巨大的手表走私组织
    主犯应华章、吴定甫等已被逮捕法办
    广西省南宁市工商界在反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报斗争中，破获了一个巨大的手表走私组织，主犯应华章、吴定甫等已被逮捕法办。
    在全国各大城市的钟表店中，都有“法国手表”。这些手表绝大部分都是从越南私运进口的。南宁是这些手表走私的中心。据南宁关估计，去年三月至十月，自越南输入的手表约二十七万只，其中半数经广西私运到全国各地。法帝国主义现在还控制着的越南的芒街，和广西省的防城县的东兴只隔一条小河。奸商们雇了单帮水客，买了手表，用各种方法偷越国境，到了东兴，再藏在汽车轮胎里或炭炉下面，塞在牛角或螃蟹壳里，以及用其他各种卑鄙龌龊的方法，运到南宁。再经过邮包和某些落后的铁路员工之手，送到全国各大城市。据内行人谈：在芒街，一两黄金可买上等法国手表一打；中、下等手表只合人民币六万到八万元。但到了天津、上海等地，一般每只都在五、六十万元左右。因为利大，所以各大城市表商眼睛都向着南宁了。
    南宁市奸商应华章，自一九四七年开设亨得利钟表行起，即经营手表走私生意。解放后更变本加厉。开始，他利用南宁广州间的落后船员，从广州私运手表。到一九五零年秋，便开始指使他的弟弟应英到龙州收购法国走私手表，勾结广西军区司令部司机操之平等，包运到南宁。一九五一年二月，港澳边境地区出入国境管制办法公布后，这些走私奸商们决定另辟新路。应犯便派他的同伙亨达利老板吴定甫，到广州参加大中华眼镜水笔行（兼营钟表）召开的走私手表会议，决定把走私中心移至南宁。会后，吴犯即急电应犯“速购法表”。三月份以后，手表走私狂潮便日益高涨了。经过应犯一手走私的法国手表，据他自供即在二万七千只以上；仅偷漏国税就有八十亿元。
    这些奸商们为达到走私的目的，不惜破坏国家的金融政策，从黑市收购黄金，输送到法国帝国主义手里去，并私套外汇。吴犯定甫在一九五零年四月，开设亨达利钟表行时，即通过天主教某神父，私套港汇二千元和私运黄金二十多两。国家因此而损失的黄金和外汇，简直难以计算。
    应、吴等犯为掩护和指挥行商水客走私，又和奸商方世镇、刘悦生等勾结，虚设南开、和记等客栈，专门私收黄金，贿赂税务干部，收买汽车司机，联系走私水客等。仅南开客栈所控制的钦州、东兴一带的走私行商，就有一百多人。据方犯自供，他自己经手收购的走私手表就在一万只以上。刘犯经手的也有八千多只。
    他们用无耻手段在税务局和南宁关等机关拉过去一些干部，攻占了一些据点；连广西省人民银行内部也有他们的爪牙。为避免检查，应犯可以把走私手表交人民银行南宁第二办事处主任钱乘桴放在银行的保险柜内。由此可见他们猖狂到什么程度了。
