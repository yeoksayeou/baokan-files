Anti-Aircraft Guns Donated by the People of the Motherland Arrive at the Korean Front
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Liu Erning

One day, an anti-aircraft gun battalion of the Chinese People's Volunteers received an order: immediately send people to a certain place to receive the anti-aircraft guns donated by the people of the motherland. This news, which they had been eagerly awaiting day and night, immediately caused a sensation throughout the battalion. Gunners excitedly ran to the battalion headquarters, vying to volunteer, saying, "Send me! I will definitely bring back the anti-aircraft guns donated by the people of the motherland!"

The battalion selected the best gun commanders, gunners, and the most skilled truck drivers from each company to receive the guns. These people all voluntarily wrote guarantees, expressing their determination to resolutely complete this glorious task. When they set off by truck, the people who came to see them off waved their hands and repeatedly exhorted, "Be careful on the road, and wish you a triumphant return!" The people in the truck replied, "We guarantee to complete the mission, and wish you victory in battle!"

The brand-new anti-aircraft guns were quickly received. The gunners carefully wiped the guns clean and had them towed back to their station by tractors. The gunners sped along the wide, flat highway, singing joyously: "The engine is roaring, the soldiers' hearts are pounding; the huge muzzle, the rolling wheels, speeding along the road to victory; Forward! Artillery of the Motherland, artillery of the People, striving to be heroes on the battlefield, making contributions for the People!"

The next night, the anti-aircraft gun team arrived at a large bridge in a certain location, where dozens of trucks were waiting at both ends of the bridge to cross. Suddenly, an enemy plane came, circling low over the bridge and dropping flares. To protect the bridge and the vehicles, the Volunteer deputy battalion commander immediately ordered the gunners to prepare to fire. The gunners had been waiting tensely, and the muzzles of the anti-aircraft guns were already tracking the enemy plane; upon the order, these anti-aircraft guns donated by the people of the motherland fought against the enemy for the first time in Korea. In the black sky, several dazzling red lights suddenly shot up, and our dense and accurate artillery fire surrounded the enemy plane. The enemy plane panicked, not even bothering to drop bombs or strafe, and tried to escape. However, the shells had already hit the enemy plane, and a plume of flame shot out from its tail, plunging southward.

A round of applause and cheers rang out around the bridge. The drivers praised one after another, saying, "The anti-aircraft artillerymen have great skills, able to shoot down planes even in the dark!" The gunners excitedly told people, "These are good guns donated by the people of the motherland, and they have already made a first-class contribution just after being shipped from the motherland!"

The gunners who remained at the station of a certain anti-aircraft gun battalion fought with enemy planes during the day, and braved the cold wind and snow at night, busily "building homes" for the new guns that were about to arrive. The gunners of the Fourth Platoon of the Third Company spent two nights preparing a "home" for the new guns. Everyone was looking forward to the arrival of the anti-aircraft guns donated by the people of the motherland as if they were looking forward to relatives. After a few days, people could no longer restrain themselves and ran to the roadside to wait, staring at every passing vehicle, some even waiting until late at night.

One night, after twelve o'clock, the battalion commander notified each company by telephone, saying, "The guns have arrived!" The telephone operator of the Third Company dropped the receiver and ran to the top of the shelter, shouting, "The guns have arrived, hurry up and pick up the guns!" The gunners, who were fast asleep, immediately got up, put on their clothes, and ran to the road when they heard the shout. While shaking hands with the people who led the guns, they noisily surrounded the guns. One touched the muzzle and said, "Good gun!" Another looked at the gun wheels and said, "New gun!" Some said, "Look how good the people of the motherland are to us, saying they would donate guns and the guns arrived." Someone suggested, "Don't touch them anymore, be careful of breaking them!" Liu Si, a gunner who had not yet touched the new guns, couldn't help but ask, "These were donated by the people of the motherland, just let me touch them once!"

The new guns from the motherland were heading to the front lines. The gunners chased after the gun trucks, cheering and crowding towards the positions. That night, the gunners set up the guns and wiped them all night. Gong Zhongming, a gunner of a new gun, wiped the gun while saying to it, "My resistance against America and aid to Korea all depends on you, and your resistance against America and aid to Korea also depends on me; we are new people and new guns, we must strive to shoot down more enemy planes to repay the people of the motherland!" The surrounding comrades couldn't help but laugh when they heard this.

    祖国人民捐献的高射炮到了朝鲜前线
    新华社记者  刘尔宁
    有一天，志愿军某高射炮营接到命令：立刻派人到某地去领祖国人民捐献的高射炮。这个日夜盼望着的消息马上轰动了全营，炮手们都兴奋地跑到营部来，争先地要求说：“派我去吧，我一定能把祖国人民捐献的高射炮带回来！”
    营里挑选了各连最优秀的炮车长、炮手和技术最好的汽车司机去领炮。这些人们都自动写了保证书，表示坚决完成这个光荣的任务。他们乘汽车出发的时候，欢送的人挥动着手频频嘱咐说：“路上多加小心，祝你们胜利归来！”车上的人回答说：“我们保证完成任务，祝你们战斗胜利！”
    簇新的高射炮很快就领到了。炮手们仔细地把炮擦得干干净净，并由牵引车拉着驶回驻地来。炮手们奔驰在宽畅平坦的公路上喜洋洋地唱着：“摩托发出了响声，战士的心脏在跳动；巨大的炮口，滚动的车轮，飞驰过胜利的路程；前进！祖国的炮兵，人民的炮兵，战场上争英雄，为人民立战功！”
    第二天晚上，高射炮队到达某地的一座大桥边，已有几十辆汽车正在桥的两头等着过去。忽然这时来了一架敌机，在桥的上空低飞盘旋，并且掷下了照明弹。领队的志愿军副营长为了保卫桥梁和汽车，立刻命令炮手们预备射击。炮手们早就在紧张地等待着，高射炮的炮口已经跟着敌机在转动；命令一下，这批祖国人民捐献的高射炮在朝鲜第一次向敌人作战了。黑色的天空里顿时冲起几道耀眼的红光，我们密集而准确的炮火已把敌机包围了起来。敌机慌乱了，顾不得投弹扫射就想逃跑。但是，炮弹已经击中了那架敌机，机尾巴上冒出一股火焰，一直向南坠落了下去。
    桥的四周响起了一阵掌声和欢呼。司机们纷纷赞扬说：“高射炮兵好本领，在黑夜也能打下飞机来！”炮手们兴冲冲地告诉人们说：“这是祖国人民捐献的好炮，才从祖国运来就立了头功！”
    留在某高射炮营驻地的炮手们白天和敌机战斗，夜里就冒着寒风冰雪，忙着给快要来到的新炮“安家”。三连四班的炮手们化了两夜功夫，就把新炮的“家”安置好了。所有的人都像盼亲人似地盼着祖国人民捐献的高射炮赶快到来。过了几天，人们已经忍耐不住了，就跑到路边上去等着，盯着驶过的每一辆汽车，有的甚至守到深夜。
    一天夜里十二点多钟，营长用电话通知各连说：“炮来到了！”三连的电话员丢下受话筒就跑到掩蔽部顶上高喊：“炮来到了，赶快去接炮啦！”正在酣睡中的炮手们一听到叫喊，立刻爬起来穿上衣服就往公路上跑。他们一面拉着领炮人的手，一面闹嚷嚷地把炮围了起来。这个摸摸炮口说：“好炮！”那个看看炮轮说：“新炮！”有的说：“你看祖国人民对咱多好，说捐炮炮就来了。”有人提议说：“不要再摸了，当心弄坏啦！”一位还没有摸过新炮的炮手刘四忍不住要求说：“这是祖国人民捐献的，只让咱摸一下吧！”
    来自祖国的新炮开向阵地了，炮手们一边追着炮车，一边欢呼着，一齐拥向阵地。当夜，炮手们把炮安置好了，并连夜擦起炮来。一门新炮的炮手龚中明一边擦着，一边向炮说：“我抗美援朝全靠你，你抗美援朝也靠我；咱们是新人新炮，要争取多打下敌机，好报答祖国人民！”周围的战友们听到了都忍不住哈哈大笑起来。
