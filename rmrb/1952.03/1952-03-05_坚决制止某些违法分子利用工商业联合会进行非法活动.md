    Resolutely Stop Certain Illegal Elements from Using the Federation of Industry and Commerce to Conduct Illegal Activities

    Certain responsible persons of the Bengbu Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce in northern Anhui Province have engaged in quite serious illegal activities. During the anti-bribery movement in industrial and commercial circles, these people's illegal acts have been successively exposed by employees. For example, Lu Erzhang, the chairman of the Federation, embezzled 160 million yuan in donations for慰劳中朝人民战士 comfort of Chinese and Korean People's Volunteer Army soldiers and relief for Korean refugees, and 240 million yuan in donations for production and disaster relief. A secretary-general of the Federation of Industry and Commerce embezzled 8 million yuan in donations for aircraft and artillery to do business. During the anti-bribery movement, these illegal capitalists not only refused to confess their crimes but also revealed their hideous and shameless faces, threatening and preventing employees from reporting them. While employees were actively reporting, illegal elements in the Bengbu Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce organized fifteen people to check the accounts managed by employees in various trade associations, attempting to "strike back" and take revenge. A person in charge of the Federation of Industry and Commerce fabricated charges of corruption against workers and forced them to confess to him. He threatened workers, saying, "You workers are about to be handcuffed, yet you still report others?" He also openly said to the directors of various trade associations at a plenary meeting of the Federation of Industry and Commerce: "Boldly collect materials on the workers and fight them to the end! What are you afraid of? I'll back you up!" The arrogant arrogance of these treacherous merchants must not be tolerated.

    The Federation of Industry and Commerce should be an organization that organizes industrialists and businessmen to engage in legal production and business in accordance with the Common Program and the policies and decrees of the People's Government. During the anti-bribery movement in industrial and commercial circles, if the person in charge of the Federation of Industry and Commerce has unclean hands, he should first confess his sins voluntarily. However, the illegal elements in the Bengbu Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce not only did not do this but also took advantage of their positions to engage in conspiracies of concealment and openly suppress whistleblowers, which is not allowed by the laws of our people's democratic country. The Bengbu Municipal leading organs must immediately stop all conspiratorial and destructive activities of illegal capitalists, order them to confess quickly, and mobilize workers and shop assistants to launch an irreconcilable struggle against illegal capitalists, forcing them to bow their heads to the people and make public statements of repentance. If certain illegal elements in the Federation of Industry and Commerce have become stumbling blocks hindering the movement, resolute measures should be taken without hesitation to remove these stumbling blocks. If they are indulged without principle or standpoint, it will lead to major mistakes.

### 坚决制止某些违法分子利用工商业联合会进行非法活动

    坚决制止某些违法分子利用工商业联合会进行非法活动
    皖北蚌埠市工商业联合会的某些负责人，有相当严重的违法行为。在工商界反行贿运动中，这些人的违法行为已被职工陆续检举出来。例如，该会主任委员卢锷璋曾挪用慰劳中朝人民战士、救济朝鲜难民的捐款一亿六千万元和生产救灾捐款两亿四千万元；工商业联合会某秘书长曾挪用捐献飞机大炮捐款八百万元作生意。在反行贿运动中，这些违法资本家不但拒绝坦白自己的罪行，而且露出狰狞无耻的面目，威胁、阻止职工检举。正在职工积极检举的时候，蚌埠市工商业联合会中的违法分子，组织了十五个人到各业同业公会，检查职工经管的账目，想“倒打一耙”，借机报复。工商业联合会某负责人曾给工人捏造贪污的罪名，强迫工人向他坦白。他威胁工人说：“你们工人都快要铐上手铐了，还检举别人吗？”他又在工商业联合会全体委员大会上，公开对各业同业公会的主任委员说：“你们大胆搜集工人的材料，同他们（指工人）干到底！怕他们做什么？有我撑腰！”这些奸商的狂妄嚣张的气焰是决不能加以容忍的。
    工商业联合会，应该是组织工商业家按照共同纲领和人民政府的政策法令进行合法的生产和营业的团体。在工商界反行贿运动中，假如工商业联合会的负责人自己手脸不净，就应该首先自动坦白悔过。但蚌埠市工商业联合会中的违法分子，不仅不这样做，反而凭借职务上的便利，偷天换日，公开进行压制检举的阴谋活动，这是我们人民民主国家的法律所不容许的。蚌埠市领导机关必须立即制止所有违法资本家的阴谋破坏活动，责令他们迅速坦白，并发动工人店员向违法资本家展开不调和的斗争，迫使违法资本家向人民低头，公开声明悔过。假如某些工商业联合会中的违法分子已经变成了阻碍运动的石头，就应毫不犹豫地采取断然措置，把这块石头搬开。如果无原则、无立场地放纵他们，就会铸成大的错误。
