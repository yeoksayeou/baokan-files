    Grateful for the People's Love for Us
    Comrade Editor: Since we were wounded on the Korean battlefield and returned to the motherland for convalescence in a hospital in Tianjin, several months have passed. During these months, the people of Tianjin have shown us boundless love: elderly men and women have come to visit us, leaning on their crutches; Young Pioneers have come to present us with flowers and have given us their most beloved and precious red scarves; government personnel and representatives from all walks of life have sent us many gifts of comfort; performing arts troupes have come to the hospital to give us many wonderful performances. The working comrades in the hospital have been even more enthusiastic and attentive in their care for us; some of them do not rest even on Sundays, and usually work two hours of overtime every day. Some nurses help us wash clothes, make quilts, and mend socks after they get off work. We each deeply remember this kindness in our hearts. The reason we are able to receive such lofty honor and excellent care is because of the correct leadership of the Party and the active support of the people of the whole country. In order to protect the peaceful and happy lives of the people of our motherland, and to repay the people's love for us, we must take good care of ourselves, strive to recover our health as soon as possible, and return to the Korean front to fight the American invaders. If we are disabled due to our injuries and cannot return to the battlefield, we will also obey the organization's arrangements and devote ourselves to the economic construction front of the motherland, and become brave and active production fighters.

    感激人民对我们的热爱
    编辑同志：自从我们在朝鲜战场负伤回到祖国后，在天津某医院休养，已经有好几个月了。在这几个月中间，天津市人民对于我们的热爱是说不完的：老大爷、老大娘扶着拐杖来探望我们；少年儿童队员来给我们献花，并且把他们最心爱最宝贵的红领巾送给我们；政府人员和各界代表给我们送来许多慰问品；文工团到医院来给我们演出许多精彩的节目。医院里的工作同志对我们更是热情细心地照顾，他们有的在星期天都不休息，平时每日加班两小时。有些护士同志下了班就帮助我们洗衣服、做被子、缝袜子。我们每个人都把这种盛意深深地记在心里。我们所以能够得到这样崇高的荣誉和很好的照顾，是因为有党的正确领导和全国人民的积极支援。为了保护祖国人民的和平幸福的生活，回答人民对我们的热爱，我们要好好地休养，争取早日恢复健康，重上朝鲜前线，去打击美国侵略者。假如因伤残废了，没条件重上战场，我们也要服从组织分配，投入祖国经济建设战线上，当一个勇敢积极的生产战斗员。    志愿军休养员  李长振
