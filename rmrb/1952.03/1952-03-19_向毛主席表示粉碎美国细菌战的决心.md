    Expressing to Chairman Mao the Determination to Crush the American Germ Warfare
    Teachers and Staff of the Biology Department of Tsinghua University are Willing to Contribute to Extinguishing the Flames of Germ Warfare
    Respected Chairman Mao: We vehemently denounce the towering crime of American imperialism in spreading germs in Korea and Northeast China. We are biological scientists, and we await your call to go to the forefront of the anti-germ warfare.
    Under the leadership and education of the Party and you, through the "Three-Anti" movement, we have deeply recognized the ideological poisoning caused by American imperialist cultural aggression. We have sorrowfully condemned the vicious conspiracies of American imperialism and have achieved initial victories on the ideological front. Now we are determined to take practical actions to eliminate the enemy. Under your correct leadership, we are confident of achieving the final victory in the anti-germ warfare. We extend our highest respects.
    Chen Zhen, Professor and Head of Biology Department, Tsinghua University. Professors Zhao Yibing, Cui Zhilan, Lecturers Shen Shankun.
    Assistants Li Jianwu, Zang Wendi, Duan Jinyu, Wang Anlin, Cai Yipeng, Tu Jiyuan.
    Respected Chairman Mao: American imperialism has scattered a large number of germ-carrying insects in Korea and Northeast China to slaughter Chinese and Korean soldiers and peaceful residents, arousing our unparalleled anger. We support the statement of Foreign Minister Zhou on March 8th, and we angrily protest the crimes of American imperialism in conducting inhumane germ warfare. We cannot tolerate American imperialism using germ weapons, which are absolutely prohibited by international law and human morality, to frantically slaughter humanity. We must strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, participate in epidemic prevention work with practical actions, await government calls at any time, and request to learn epidemic prevention technology. We are prepared to wage a resolute struggle against germ weapons and eliminate the American imperialist aggressors.
    Employees of the Biology Department of Tsinghua University: Zhang Ruiqing, Kong Shipei, Liu Yanxiang, Zhao Runliang, Du Guilin, Dong Yuanzhong, Wu Deming.
    Students of the Physics Department of Peking University are Ready to Go to the Front Lines to Extinguish Germs
    Respected Chairman Mao: We felt extremely angry after reading the news that American imperialism had spread a large number of germs in Northeast China. We will never tolerate the towering crimes of American imperialism poisoning our compatriots. We are waiting for your solemn call to let us go to the forefront of extinguishing germs - Northeast China or Korea.
    We already have certain scientific knowledge, and after a short period of training, we can master the technology of extinguishing germs. Therefore, please grant our request. Now all the students guarantee to you that we have full confidence in completing all the tasks assigned to us by the motherland.
    We await your call with enthusiasm.
    With respects, Students of the Physics Department of Peking University, Wu Gongjian and 71 others (signatures omitted)
    Cadres and Students of Beijing Medical School Request to Work on the Korean Front Lines
    Respected Chairman Mao: We are cadres and students of Beijing Medical School. When we saw in the newspapers that American imperialism was blatantly spreading a large number of germ-carrying insects in Korea and Northeast China, everyone was filled with righteous indignation and their hearts were filled with unparalleled anger.
    Some of us are medical workers, some are political workers, we are all outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, and we are all soldiers who have been tempered in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. We are determined to take up weapons and rush to the Korean battlefield to completely eliminate those "poisonous insects" that harm mankind.
    Therefore, we earnestly request you to approve our formation of an epidemic prevention team and let us rush to the Korean front lines to ensure the smooth completion of the task. Just like the anti-corruption movement, we will never withdraw our troops until we achieve a complete victory. With respects, Wang Ciwu, Wang Haoli, Chen Tonghai, Yuan Qingzhong, Zhao Jingyong, Song Haichuan, Li Yanzhou
    Employees of Beijing Surgical Hospital are Determined to Fight American Imperialism to the End
    Respected Chairman Mao: When our anti-corruption movement was reaching its climax, we heard the news that the inhuman American imperialists were conducting germ warfare in Korea and on the northeastern border of China, and everyone felt unparalleled anger. We have all written letters of determination and handed them over to the organization.
    American imperialism wants to use germ warfare to intimidate us, which is impossible, and humanity has a way to eliminate germs.
    We are medical workers, and we have made the greatest determination to go to the Korean front lines and fight American imperialism to the end in order to defend world peace and protect the happiness of the Chinese and Korean people. We wish you good health. All employees of Beijing Surgical Hospital

    Dear Chairman Mao: When we saw the news that the vicious and shameless American imperialists were spreading a large number of germs in Korea and Northeast China, we were filled with indignation. We are the hot-blooded youth of the new China, can we turn a blind eye to such brutal bestialities of American imperialism? No, absolutely not! The fire of anger is burning in our hearts, and our blood is boiling.
    Although we are studying obstetrics, we have learned about inspection, epidemic prevention, and general nursing work. Although our skills are not very good, we are confident that we can do these jobs well. We firmly demand to go to the forefront of the anti-germ warfare. Finally, we shout Long Live Chairman Mao!

    Respected Chairman Mao: The vicious American imperialists, ignoring the protests of the Chinese people, are following the old path of Japanese fascism and continuously spreading germs on the sacred territory of our motherland. American imperialism is our mortal enemy! All officers and soldiers of our People's Navy are extremely angry. We unanimously stated that we will resolutely use practical actions to crush the atrocities of American imperialism and defend peace in Asia and the world.
    Respected Chairman Mao, I am an ordinary member of the Chinese People's Navy. In order to defend the motherland and protect the fruits of the people's victory, I make the following guarantees to you: I will closely unite the masses, resolutely repel the attacks of the bourgeoisie, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers in achieving the final victory; strengthen the spirit of diligent study and hard practice, and accelerate the improvement of modern science and technology; guarding the forefront of the motherland's coastal defense, if imperialism dares to take the risk of invading, we will resolutely eliminate it in the ocean!

I resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement. I am determined to further mobilize and organize the militia, diligently practice both literacy and military skills, improve our physical fitness, do a good job in suppressing bandits and eliminating special agents, consolidate local security, and assume the important task of protecting our homes and defending the country. I will also widely publicize among the masses and expose the crazy crimes of the American bandits in spreading germs; lead the masses to engage in the patriotic production movement, produce enough grain and industrial raw materials to strengthen the material strength of resisting America and aiding Korea, and support the Korean People's Army and our most beloved people - the Chinese People's Volunteers, to smash the conspiracy of American imperialism.
