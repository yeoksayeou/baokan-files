    We Must Use Practical Actions to Protest the Atrocities of American Imperialism
    Tang Feifan, Director of the Central Ministry of Health's Institute of Biological Products
    Since the news broke that the invading American army was using bacteriological weapons in Korea, the people of our country and peace-loving people around the world have continuously raised serious protests and righteous warnings. Now, the American aggressors not only show no remorse, but have intensified their efforts to expand the scope of bacteriological warfare. Since February 29th, they have repeatedly invaded our Northeast with airplanes, scattering large amounts of poisonous insects and bacteria in Fushun, Xinmin, Andong, Kuandian and other places. This mad behavior of American imperialism more fully proves that it has completely lost its humanity and is beyond reason. At the same time, it also fully illustrates that it is not only the enemy of the Chinese and Korean people, but also the enemy of all mankind. If the atrocities of American imperialism are not stopped, not only will the Chinese and Korean people be unable to live and work in peace, but the civilization of all mankind will also lose its guarantee.
    Bacteriological weapons cannot save the American invaders from their predetermined defeat. Its direct effect on the war is minimal. However, the use of bacteriological weapons is the most serious violation of human justice. For thousands of years, mankind has created science through labor, and our ancestors have accumulated experience and wisdom generation after generation, all for the benefit of generations of mankind. Our medical workers work diligently day and night to eliminate human diseases and sufferings. However, the insane American bandits have shamefully stolen the fruits of science and used them to create artificial disasters. We absolutely cannot allow this heinous crime. For the sake of the motherland, for the sake of peace, for the sake of science and civilization, and for the sake of all mankind's descendants, we must contribute all our strength to stop the atrocities of the American invaders.
    All the staff of our Central Ministry of Health's Institute of Biological Products have long been prepared to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. When we learned that the American bandits were using bacteriological weapons in Korea, all the staff of the institute were filled with righteous indignation and took action: on the one hand, they intensified the ongoing anti-corruption movement, determined to carry it through to the end, to eliminate all corrupt elements hidden in our ranks, and to eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology; on the other hand, they are working day and night selflessly with unparalleled enthusiasm to defeat the enemy's bacteriological warfare.
    Bacteriological weapons can pose a certain threat and may cause quite serious consequences if people are not vigilant and unprepared. We must not be negligent and must not underestimate the situation. We must complete all necessary preparations as soon as possible. However, bacteriological weapons are not new, and there is nothing remarkable about them. As long as we are prepared, bacteriological weapons are not at all terrible and can be completely prevented.
    It is just a dream for the American aggressors to think they can find an advantage in waging bacteriological warfare. Their use of bacteriological weapons only exposes the weakness of the American bandits and shows that they can no longer reverse their dying fate. This inhumane atrocity will surely prompt all peace-loving people around the world, including the American people, to rise up together and fight to stop the aggression of American imperialism.

### 我们要用实际行动来抗议美帝国主义的暴行

    我们要用实际行动来抗议美帝国主义的暴行
    中央卫生部生物制品研究所所长  汤飞凡
    侵朝美军在朝鲜使用细菌武器的消息传出以后，我国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民曾不断地提出严重的抗议和正义的警告。现在美国侵略者不但不知悔改，反而变本加厉地扩大了细菌战的范围。自二月二十九日起，他们竟多次用飞机侵入我国东北，在抚顺、新民、安东、宽甸等地大量撒布毒虫和细菌。美帝国主义这种疯狂的行为，更充分地证明它已完全丧失了人性，已经不可以理喻了。同时也更充分地说明它不但是中朝人民的敌人，而且是全人类的敌人。如不制止美帝国主义的暴行，则不但中朝人民不能安居乐业，全人类文明也将失去保障。
    细菌武器并不能挽救美国侵略者既定的败局。它对战争的直接效果是微乎其微的。但是使用细菌武器对于人类的正义却是最严重的破坏。数千年来，人类用劳动创造了科学，我们的祖先一代代地积累了经验和智慧，都是为了造福于世世代代的人类。我们医务工作者日夜辛勤地工作，更是为了消灭人类的病患和疾苦。但是，丧心病狂的美国强盗，却可耻地窃取了科学的成果，用以制造人工的灾患。这种滔天的罪行，是我们绝对不能允许的。为了祖国，为了和平，为了科学与文明，为了全人类的子孙后代，我们要贡献出全部力量来制止美国侵略者的暴行。
    我们中央卫生部生物制品研究所的全体职工们，早已作好了随时响应祖国号召的准备。当我们知道了美国强盗在朝鲜使用细菌武器以后，全所职工已经义愤填膺地行动起来：一方面加紧了正在进行中的反贪污运动，要把这一运动进行到底，肃清所有隐藏在我们队伍中的贪污分子，肃清资产阶级思想的影响；一方面正以无比的热情不分昼夜地忘我地为粉碎敌人的细菌战而工作。
    细菌武器在人们没有警惕、不加防备的条件下是可以形成一定的威胁的，也可能引起相当严重的后果，我们不可麻痹，不可对情况估计不足。我们必须尽速完成一切必要的准备。但是，细菌武器并不是什么新鲜玩意，其中也并没有什么了不起的奥妙。只要我们有准备，细菌武器是毫不可怕的，而且是完全可以预防的。
    美国侵略者要想在进行细菌战里找便宜，这只是梦想。他们使用细菌武器，只是暴露了美国强盗的弱点，说明它已经无法挽回其垂死的命运。这种灭绝人性的暴行，一定会促使全世界爱好和平的人民，包括美国的人民在内，一致奋起，为制止美帝国主义的侵略而奋斗。
