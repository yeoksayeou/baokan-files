    Hold the Pass, Don't Let a Single Profiteer Slip Through

    Editor: Some profiteers are using many tricks when filling out the "Investigation Form for Handling Illegal Industrial and Commercial Households." For example, the profiteer from Beijing Taihe Yong Weaving Factory omitted over 300 million yuan of tax from their business turnover, only filling in over 60 million yuan. The profiteer from Hua Xing Weaving Factory rushed to submit the form without having the workers review it. The profiteer from Lin's Weaving Factory forced the workers to stamp their approval. In short, these profiteers still want to deceive and slip through the net in such a vigorous campaign, and are unwilling to thoroughly confess their problems. Therefore, we convened a "Pass-Holding Conference" on March 7th. Everyone pledged to hold the pass and not let a single profiteer sneak by.

### 把住关口别让一个奸商漏过

    把住关口别让一个奸商漏过
    编辑同志：有些奸商在填写“违法工商户处理调查表”时，有很多花招。北京泰和永织布厂奸商漏了三亿多元流水的税，只填写了六千多万元。华兴织布厂奸商不叫工人审查，就赶着去缴表。林记织布厂奸商强迫工人盖章通过。总之，这些奸商在这样轰轰烈烈的运动里，还想蒙骗、漏网，不肯彻底交代问题。为此，我们在三月七日召开了“把关大会”。大家都保证把住关口，不叫一个奸商偷偷地溜过去。
