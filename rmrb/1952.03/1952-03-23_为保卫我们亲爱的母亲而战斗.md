    Fighting to Defend Our Dear Mother
    By Jiong Yan, Returning Representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    Only two days after arriving in Dihua, I heard the name of Wu Gunishahan, a 103-year-old Uygur mother. On the afternoon of February 7th, my Korean comrade Cai Hengmo and I went to visit her.
    As soon as our car arrived at the old mother's door, the surrounding masses surged forward to surround us. When old mother Wu Gunishahan appeared before us, we couldn't believe that this was the 103-year-old woman. She was full of energy, healthy, and smiling at everyone. How happy and delighted I was in my heart! Without waiting for anyone to introduce us, the old mother tightly grasped our hands, affectionately stroked my head, and excitedly inquired about everything at the Korean front: "My girls, my children, are the sisters in Korea all well! You are suffering from the cold and fatigue for the sake of the country, you have worked hard! Come, let me hug you!" She was filled with fiery enthusiasm, pinned big red flowers on our chests, and put precious Uygur hats on our heads. She took out silver bracelets that had been stored in her box for decades and handed them to us, instructing us to give them to the heroic girls at the Korean front. She took out a "Hundred-Family Cloth" sewn by hand from countless pieces of colorful scraps, and said, "Please give this to the children fighting in the icy and snowy fields, so they can sleep warmer." When I received these gifts, tears welled up in my eyes. I am proud that our motherland has thousands upon thousands of mothers who love us so much. Let every soldier receive the love and care of this great mother!
    In the old mother's house, a spinning wheel was placed in a corner of the kang. On the front wall were posted portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. On the left side was a slogan written in colored paper with the four large characters "Resist America, Aid Korea." Below the portraits of the leaders was a neatly written "Wu Gunishahan Patriotic Pact." The seventh article of the pact is: "Respond to Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice economy. Spin four liang of thread every day, and save two yuan (Xinjiang Province currency, equivalent to 700 yuan in RMB) every day to donate airplanes and cannons to resist America and aid Korea." People told me that last summer, the old mother also went up the mountain to pick one dou and five sheng of wheat, and donated it all. In this simple and unadorned house, I saw an endless stream of strength flowing from the Pamir Plateau to the Korean front. The four hundred and seventy-five million people of the motherland, including the 103-year-old mother, are all supporting us.
    Our conversation went on for a long time, and we didn't say goodbye until dusk. I will never forget the voice of old mother Wu Gunishahan. I seem to often see her spinning wheel turning and her figure bending over on the hillside, picking up wheat ear by ear to support us. Dear comrades, fight more bravely, fight to defend the 103-year-old mother! Fight to defend all the mothers of the country!

    为保卫我们亲爱的母亲而战斗
    中国人民志愿军归国代表  炯炎
    到迪化后才两天，我便听到了一百零三岁的维吾尔族老妈妈吾古尼沙汗的名字。二月七日下午，我和朝鲜战友蔡亨默去拜访了她。
    车子刚到老妈妈的门口，附近的群众就涌上来包围了我们。当吾古尼沙汗老妈妈出现在我们面前时，我们竟不敢相信这就是那位一百零三岁的老人。她精神充沛，身体健康，向大家欢笑。我心里多么高兴愉快啊！老妈妈没有等到别人介绍，便紧紧地握住我们的手，亲切地抚摩着我的头，兴奋地打问着朝鲜前线的一切：“我的姑娘、孩子们，朝鲜的姐妹们都好吧！你们挨冻受累为了国家，辛苦了！来，我抱抱你们！”她充满着火样的热情，拿大红花戴在我们胸前，给我们戴上珍贵的维吾尔族帽子。她把存在箱子里几十年的银手镯拿出来交给我们，嘱我们转赠给朝鲜前线的英雄姑娘。她拿出一件亲手用无数块各色碎布缝成的“百家布”，说：“请转送给在冰天雪地里作战的孩子们，让他们睡得暖和些。”当我接过这些礼物时，眼里涌起了泪花。我为我们祖国有千千万万这样热爱我们的母亲而感到骄傲。让每一个战士都领受这伟大的母亲的爱和关怀吧！
    在老妈妈的房子里，炕的一角放着一辆纺车。正面墙上张贴着毛主席、朱总司令的画像。左侧贴着用有色纸写的“抗美援朝”四个大字的标语。在领袖像下面，贴着写得整整齐齐的“吾古尼沙汗爱国公约”。公约的第七条是：“响应毛主席号召，增产节约。每天纺四两线，每天节约两块钱（新疆省币，折人民币七百元）捐献飞机大炮，抗美援朝。”人们告诉我：在去年夏天，老妈妈还上山拾了一斗五升麦子，全部捐献出来。在这简单朴素的屋子里，我看到了从帕米尔高原一直流向朝鲜前线的一股无穷无尽的力量。祖国的四亿七千五百万人民，连一百零三岁的老母亲在内，都在支援着我们。
    我们的谈话很久也谈不完，直到黄昏才告辞出来。我永远也忘不了吾古尼沙汗老妈妈的声音。我好像时常看见她那旋转着的纺车和她那俯身在山坡上一穗一颗地拾麦子来支援我们时的背影。亲爱的战友们，更英勇地战斗吧，为保卫一百零三岁的老妈妈而战斗！为保卫全国所有的母亲而战斗！
