    Germ Warfare Cannot Intimidate Us
    Li Xigan, Professor of Bacteriology, Peking University Medical School
    The crime of the American aggressors in invading our country and spreading large quantities of germ-carrying flies, mosquitoes, fleas, and other poisonous insects has further exposed their hideous and ugly faces, and increased the resentment of the people of our country and the world. The people in our front and rear must further summon up the courage to kill the enemy and the confidence to win victory, and vow to hand these executioners over to the righteous people for the most severe judgment.
    We warn the American executioners: germ warfare cannot save the aggressors from military failure. The process of the demise of the Japanese and German fascists in history is clear proof. We, the Chinese and Korean people, have the power and confidence to prevent and eliminate the germs and poisons spread by the aggressors, just as we have the power and confidence to eliminate the invading troops on the Korean battlefield. Now, the epidemic prevention and inspection teams of China and Korea have gone to the battlefield to fight for the safety of the people, and we in the rear are making the greatest efforts to strengthen the organization of epidemic prevention and prepare to support the front with powerful forces. Our efforts will surely be victorious.
    We bacteriologists have been fighting against harmful and disease-causing bacteria for years, working to eliminate human diseases. Today, we have a clearer understanding that as long as science and technology fall into the hands of imperialists, they will be used as tools for massacring mankind. We denounce the scum of the scientific community who plan and manufacture germ weapons, because they are enemies of the people. We should work harder in the future, and organize and mobilize our scientific knowledge and all our strength to do a good job in epidemic prevention, and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, and strive to eliminate the barbarous enemy.

    细菌战吓倒不了我们
    北京大学医学院细菌系教授  黎希干
    美国侵略者侵入我国境内撒布大量传播细菌的苍蝇、蚊子、跳蚤等毒虫的罪行，更加暴露了他们狰狞丑恶的面孔，增加了我国和全世界人民的愤恨。我们前后方的人民，一定要更加鼓起杀敌勇气和胜利信心，誓将这些刽子手们交与正义的人民作最严厉的裁判。
    我们正告美国刽子手们：细菌战术是不能挽救侵略者的军事失败的，历史上日、德法西斯的灭亡过程，就是明证。我们中朝人民有力量和信心能预防和扑灭侵略者所撒布的细菌毒物，正像我们有力量和信心消灭朝鲜战场上的侵略军队一样。现在，中朝两国的防疫检验队伍已开到战场上为人民的安全而斗争，我们后方正用最大的努力加强防疫的组织，准备以强大的力量来支援前线。我们的努力，必将获得胜利。
    我们细菌学工作者积年累月与害人致病的细菌作斗争，为消除人类的疾病而工作。今天，我们更认清楚了只要科学技术一落在帝国主义的手里，便被用作残杀人类的工具。我们痛斥计划与制造细菌武器的科学界败类，因为他们与人民为敌。我们今后更应该努力工作，并将我们的科学知识与一切力量组织动员起来，做好防疫的准备工作，随时准备响应祖国的号召，为消灭野蛮的敌人而奋斗。
