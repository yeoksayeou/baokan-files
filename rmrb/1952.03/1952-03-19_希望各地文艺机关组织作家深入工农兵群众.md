    Hoping Literary and Art Organizations in Various Regions Organize Writers to Go Deep Among Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
    Editor: I was very pleased to see that the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles organized a group of writers to go to Korea, factories, rural areas, and Shanghai to participate in the anti-bribery and anti-theft movement.
    During this rectification and study movement in literary and art circles, I have seen many literary and art workers' self-criticisms in newspapers and literary publications. The reason why these literary and art workers made mistakes is mainly because they did not correctly implement Chairman Mao's literary and art line, did not participate in the struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and their thoughts and feelings were not well transformed. These literary and art workers have expressed their willingness to participate in actual struggles and better transform themselves. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles' organization of literary and art workers to participate in actual struggles this time demonstrates the achievements of this literary and art rectification movement.
    The main task of literary and art organizations is to organize writers to go deep into life and create, rather than just doing some trivial administrative work. This is what all literary and art organizations have recognized in this literary and art rectification movement and the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. I hope that literary and art organizations in various regions will also organize writers to go deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers, so that writers can transform their thoughts and obtain the source of creation from the masses, and create excellent works.

    希望各地文艺机关组织作家深入工农兵群众
    编辑同志：看到全国文学艺术界联合会组织一批作家到朝鲜、工厂、农村和到上海参加反行贿、反盗窃运动的消息，我感到非常高兴。
    这次文艺界的整风学习中，在报纸和文艺刊物上，我看到过不少的文艺工作者的检讨。这些文艺工作者所以犯了错误，主要是由于没有正确地执行毛主席的文艺路线，没有参加工农兵的斗争，思想感情没有得到很好的改造。这些文艺工作者都表示了愿意参加实际斗争，更好地改造自己。全国文学艺术界联合会这次组织文艺工作者参加实际斗争，正表现了这一次文艺整风运动的成绩。
    文艺机关的主要工作，是组织作家深入生活，进行创作，而不是只为了做一些琐碎的事务工作，这是在这一次文艺整风运动中和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中各文艺机关都认识到了的。我希望各地的文艺机关也组织作家深入工农兵群众，使作家改造自己的思想，并从群众中获得创作的源泉，创作出优秀的作品来。
