    Leading Cadres of Zhengzhou Municipal Trade Company in Henan Province
    Should Correct Right-Leaning Ideology and Acts of Shielding Embezzlers
    To the Editor: The leading cadres of the Zhengzhou Municipal Trade Company in Henan Province have serious right-leaning ideology and acts of shielding embezzlers in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. In the anti-corruption movement, the state-owned People's Sports Goods Factory in Beijing discovered that when procurement officer Liu Wenxuan went to the Zhengzhou Municipal Trade Company last year to purchase cowhide, he colluded with Hou Zhonghe and Liu Yunfeng, clerks of the Zhengzhou Municipal Trade Company, to steal state property. Hou Zhonghe and Liu Yunfeng took Liu Wenxuan to their own Longyuan Leather Shop and private leather shops such as Tongdehe, Xinsheng, and Hefeng to purchase cowhide, causing serious losses to state assets. In order to clarify this issue, the Sports Goods Factory sent us to Zhengzhou for investigation. When we arrived in Zhengzhou, we went to the company's manager, Kang Bin, and asked him to provide us with materials related to Hou Zhonghe and others. However, Kang Bin said, "Hou Zhonghe embezzled 40 to 50 million yuan before 1950, and there shouldn't be any problems after 1951, because a corrupt element was dealt with in the trade company in 1950, and everyone was educated." Later, we went to see him several times, but not only did he not help us well, but he also evaded the issue, asking us to find the secretary or the personnel department. When we went to see him for the last time, we explained our intentions to him repeatedly and asked for his help. Only then did he call Hou Zhonghe over and say, "Hou Zhonghe! Your problem has been explained clearly, so don't have any concerns. If you know of any problems with their (referring to us) purchase of leather, you can talk to them about it." Kang Bin, as the manager, not only did not actively mobilize Hou Zhonghe to confess his problems, but instead tried to exonerate him. This approach is very wrong. When we went to Comrade Gao Yuxi of the company's personnel department to inquire about Liu Yunfeng's situation, Gao Yuxi also called Liu over and said, "Your problem has been explained clearly, and the leadership has announced that you are exempt from criminal punishment. Talk about the problems you know!" As a result, Hou Zhonghe and Liu Yunfeng refused to talk about luring Liu Wenxuan to private leather shops to purchase leather and stealing state assets from it. In fact, have their problems been explained clearly? According to Liu Wenxuan's confession, under Hou Zhonghe's instructions, the People's Sports Goods Factory lost 20 to 30 million yuan just from the leather purchased at Longyuan. The above facts show that the right-leaning paralysis of the company's leading cadres is very serious. We believe that they should conduct a profound self-examination in connection with their own work.

    河南郑州市贸易公司领导干部
    应纠正右倾思想和袒护贪污分子的行为
    编辑同志：河南省郑州市贸易公司的领导干部，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，有严重的右倾思想和袒护贪污分子的行为。在反贪污运动中，北京市公营人民体育用品工厂，发现采购员刘文轩去年到郑州市贸易公司购买牛皮时，曾和郑州市贸易公司办事员侯中和、刘云峰互相勾结盗窃国家财产。侯中和、刘云峰带刘文轩到他们开设的隆源皮行和私营同德和、新生、合丰等皮行去购买牛皮，使国家资财受到了严重的损失。体育用品工厂为了把这个问题搞清楚，就派我们到郑州去调查。我们到了郑州，就去找该公司经理康斌，请他供给我们有关侯中和等的材料。但康斌说：“侯中和在一九五零年以前贪污四、五千万元，一九五一年以后不会有什么问题，因为一九五零年贸易公司里处理了一个贪污分子，大家都受到了教育。”以后我们又接连找过他几次，他不但没有很好地帮助我们，反而左推右托，要我们去找秘书，找人事科。我们最后一次去找他时，再三向他说明来意，要求他给以帮助，他才把侯中和叫来，并说：“侯中和！你的问题已经交代清楚了，再也不要有什么顾虑，你知道他们
    （指我们）购皮子有什么问题，可以给他们谈一谈。”康斌身为经理，不但不好好动员侯中和交代问题，反而替他开脱，这种作法是十分错误的。当我们去向该公司人事科郜玉玺同志了解刘云峰的情况时，郜玉玺也同样把刘叫来说：“你的问题已经交代清楚了，领导上已宣布免予刑事处分，你知道的问题谈吧！”结果侯中和与刘云峰绝口不谈勾引刘文轩到私营皮行购皮，从中盗窃国家资财的事。事实上，他们的问题是否已经交代清楚了呢？据刘文轩自供：在侯中和的指使下，他只在隆源购买的皮子，就使人民体育用品工厂损失了二、三千万元。以上事实说明该公司领导干部的右倾麻痹思想是十分严重，我们认为，他们应该联系自己的工作作深刻检查。
