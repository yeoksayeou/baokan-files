    China Construction Enterprise Company Should Examine the Error of Harboring Lawbreakers
    Editor: In October 1950, our New Legal Research Institute spent over 180 million yuan to build a large classroom. The project was designed, material inspected, and supervised by the Shanxin Architectural Firm, and contracted to a private construction company through bidding. After the project started, they colluded to cut corners and steal state property, resulting in several work stoppages. After mediation by the Construction Bureau and a three-party agreement, it was decided that the Construction Bureau would conduct a thorough investigation and handle the matter after completion. However, Zhang Shanxin, the person in charge of the Shanxin Architectural Firm, fled to Xi'an before the project was completed. According to our understanding, Zhang Shanxin was transferred to Xi'an by the China Construction Enterprise Company; originally, Zhang was a consultant to the company. We have repeatedly requested the Construction Bureau to bring Zhang back, but due to the obstruction of the company, there has been no result to date. We believe that the China Construction Enterprise Company's act of harboring Zhang Shanxin's illegal activities is wrong. We demand that Zhang Shanxin be dealt with according to the law.

    中国建筑企业公司应检查包庇不法分子的错误
    编辑同志：我们新法学研究院在一九五○年十月，曾以一亿八千多万元，兴建大教室一座。这个工程由善新建筑事务所负责设计、验料监工，由某私营营造厂招标承做。工程开工后，他们互相勾结偷工减料，盗窃国家财产，因而停工数次。经建设局的调解及三方协议，决定竣工后由建设局彻查处理。但善新建筑事务所负责人张善新未等工程完竣，即逃到西安。据我们了解，张善新到西安是被中国建筑企业公司调去的，原来张是该公司的顾问。我们几次请求建设局把张追回，由于该公司的阻挠，到现在还没有结果。我们认为中国建筑企业公司包庇张善新的不法行为是错误的。我们要求依法处理张善新。
