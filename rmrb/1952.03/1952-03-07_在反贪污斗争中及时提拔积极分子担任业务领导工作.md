    Promptly Promote Activists to Business Leadership Positions in the Anti-Corruption Struggle

    After the chief of the Materials Section of the Northeast Fourth Textile Factory was dismissed during the anti-corruption campaign, the leadership immediately promoted Xu Wanqing, a clerk in the wage section who had shown courage and determination in the campaign and had a good work record, to be the acting chief of the Materials Section. Xu Wanqing is meticulous and responsible in his work, and he is warmly welcomed and loved by the employees. The Jilin Railway Administration also promptly promoted a group of activists to leadership positions after careful consideration during the anti-corruption campaign. These activists are loyal to the revolutionary cause, have an upright style, and have relatively developed political thinking. Some of them have consistently performed well and have strong working abilities, but they have always been suppressed and excluded by corrupt elements, and the leadership's bureaucratic style meant they were not discovered by the leadership in the past. After this group of activists took on leadership roles, they ensured that business operations continued as usual, and the department's work efficiency was greatly improved compared to when it was controlled by corrupt elements.

    Some leading cadres are always afraid of affecting business operations, and therefore dare not boldly and promptly replace the corrupt elements and those who hinder the anti-corruption struggle who occupy leadership positions in certain departments, thus preventing the anti-corruption struggle from unfolding quickly and forcefully. Some leading cadres, after the anti-corruption struggle has begun, are afraid of affecting the anti-corruption struggle and dare not promptly and boldly select a group of activists from among cadres and workers to take on business leadership positions, thus leaving important business operations without anyone in charge and hindering production. The experience of the Jilin Railway Administration, the Northeast Fourth Textile Factory, and other enterprises in promptly promoting activists is worth promoting.

    在反贪污斗争中及时提拔积极分子担任业务领导工作
    东北第四纺织厂机物料科科长在反贪污运动中被撤职以后，领导方面立即把在运动中表现勇敢坚决、平日工作成绩又好的工薪科科员徐万卿提升为机物料科代理科长。徐万卿工作细致负责，受到职工们的热烈欢迎和爱戴。吉林铁路管理局也在反贪污运动中，经过周密的考察，及时提拔了一批积极分子到领导岗位上来。这些积极分子对革命事业是忠诚的，作风是正派的，政治思想是比较开展的。他们之中有些人一贯表现很好，有较强的工作能力，但一向被贪污分子压制、排挤，加以领导方面有官僚主义作风，所以过去未能被领导方面发现。这一批积极分子担任了领导工作之后，保证了业务工作照常进行，而且部门的工作效率比贪污分子把持时大为提高。
    有的领导干部总怕影响业务工作，因而不敢大胆地及时地撤换窃踞某些部门的领导岗位的贪污分子和阻碍反贪污斗争的分子，因而使反贪污斗争不能迅速地有力地展开。有的领导干部在反贪污斗争展开后，又怕影响反贪污斗争，而不敢及时地大胆地选拔一批干部和工人中的积极分子担任业务领导工作，因而使一些重要的业务工作无人负责，妨碍了生产。吉林铁路管理局和东北第四纺织厂以及其他一些企业单位及时提拔积极分子的经验，值得推广。
