After three months, it is regrettable that although we have reached agreements on several issues, there remains one remaining basic issue in dispute that has not been resolved – namely, the principle of repatriation of prisoners of war. What is even more regrettable is that your side has repeatedly admitted that only this single dispute remains unresolved. In yesterday's statement, your side once again denied this, claiming that there are two unresolved disputes, not one. To avoid unnecessary arguments on your part, I am quoting from the record here to prove that your side's statement yesterday contradicts what your side has said before. On February 27th, your side's staff acknowledged at the staff meeting that "there remains only one dispute between us." On February 29th, when the subcommittee resumed its meeting, General Lee himself said that "the only dispute remaining was brought up the day before yesterday when the staff meeting reached a general agreement on the matters we are here to approve today." On the same day, General Lee repeatedly mentioned "this dispute." In your statements on March 1st and 2nd, you were still able to maintain this consistency, admitting that there was only one dispute between the two sides. Since March 3rd, your side has suddenly put forward the completely unfounded fabrication of the so-called 50,000-man issue as another dispute, insisting that there are now two disputes between the two sides. Today, both sides should make every effort to resolve the existing single issue, but your side is not only not taking positive action, but is fabricating another so-called "dispute" out of thin air. There is no other explanation for your side's actions other than to delay the meeting. As I pointed out yesterday, your side can, of course, turn one disagreement into two, three, or even four, but if you want to solve the problem, you must first face the facts. And the fact is that there is only one major dispute between us, neither two, nor three, nor four. As for the so-called 50,000-man issue raised by your side, it is a completely unfounded fabrication that cannot be established at all. I have refuted it many times, and your side is well aware of it, so there is no need to say more.

Regarding the only existing dispute between us – the principle of repatriation of prisoners of war – your side has expressed three points as a basis for consultation. We believe that the three points expressed by your side are not actually seeking to solve the problem, and do not conform to the situation of the discussions between the two sides on this issue. Your side said: "We want all of our captured personnel in your custody who request to return to our side to come back. We mean 'all,' not just a part of them." Your side also said: "We are willing to hand over to your side all nationals of the Republic of Korea in our custody, whether prisoners of war or detained civilians, who wish to return to your side." In fact, our side has never intended to detain your side's captured personnel, and we have repeatedly made it clear that we are prepared to release and repatriate all of your side's captured personnel in our custody. It is your side that is attempting to detain our captured personnel under the pretext of so-called "reclassification," refusing to repatriate all of our captured personnel to our side. If your side is truly interested in solving the problem, your side should not forget at any time that the so-called 50,000-man issue fabricated by your side and the so-called "reclassification" are what our side firmly cannot recognize. Your side said, "We have no intention of detaining your personnel, and we will not send those who vehemently oppose going to your side back to your side." As I have pointed out many times, that is just your side's attempt to detain our captured personnel under the pretext of non-forcible repatriation – which does not actually solve the problem. Our side's position and reasons have been fully stated, and there is no need to say more here. We believe that although we have not yet determined solutions to some issues, this does not affect or hinder the basis of the agreements we have already reached. In other words, we should advance step by step on the basis of existing achievements, and should not stop or even regress. Therefore, I think that our statement on March 5th correctly pointed out the correct path we should take. I would like to repeat a paragraph from my speech at that time: "In order to seek a reasonable solution, the correct path is not to overturn the agreed or determined materials and retreat, but to advance on the basis of the agreed or held materials in order to gradually seek a solution to the problem. Therefore, we believe that both sides can and should first determine the principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice on the basis of the materials exchanged regarding the prisoners of war held by both sides." If your side has any constructive suggestions regarding resolving the existing disputes between us, we are willing to listen.

    三月十二日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程小组委员会上
    我方代表的发言全文
    经过三个月的时间，很遗憾地虽然我们在若干问题上达成了协议，但还剩下一个唯一的在争执中的基本问题未能解决——那就是遣返战俘的原则问题。更使人遗憾的，是你方自己原来也多次承认只剩下这个唯一的争端没有解决。你方在昨天的发言里却又一次加以否认说现在剩下没有解决的争端是两个，不是一个。为了免除你方作不必要的争辩，我在这里从记录中引用你方自己说的话来证明你方昨天的发言和你方以前所说互相矛盾。二月二十七日你方的参谋在参谋会议上承认“我们之间只剩下了一个争端。”二月二十九日小组会复会时，李比将军自己也说过“前天当参谋人员会议对我们今天在这里批准的事项达成大体上的协议时，剩下的唯一争端被提出来了。”在同一天，被李比将军多次提到“这一争端”，在三月一日和二日你方的发言仍然能够保持着这个一贯性，承认双方之间只剩下一个争端。自三月三日起，你方突然把你方的所谓五万人问题那一毫无根据的捏造作为另一争端提出来，硬说双方现存的争端有两个。今天双方应当尽一切努力来解决现存的唯一问题，你方却不但不采取积极的行动，反而凭空制造出另一个所谓“争端”来，你方这种行动除了拖延会议以外，是无法作其他的解释的。正如我方昨天所指出的你方当然可以把一个分歧说成两个、三个甚至于四个，但是如果要解决问题，首先必须面对事实。而事实上我们双方之间只有一个主要的争端，既不是两个，也不是三个或四个。至于你方所提的那个所谓五万人的问题，那是毫无根据完全不能成立的捏造，我已多次驳斥过，你方也知道得很清楚，不必多说。
    关于我们之间现存的唯一争端——遣返战俘原则，你方表示了愿意进行协商的三点基础。我们认为你方所表示的三点基础，实际上是并非求取解决问题，而且不符合于双方在这一问题上讨论的情况的。你方说：“在你们收容下的我方被俘人员，凡要求回到我方来的，我们要他们全部回来，我们是说‘全部’，不仅仅是他们中间的一部分”。你方又说：“被我们收容的大韩民国国民不论是战俘或被拘留的平民，凡愿意回到你方去的，我们愿意把他们交给你方”。事实上我方从来就无意扣留你方的被俘人员，我们并且屡次明确表示准备释放并遣返我方所收容的全部你方的被俘人员，而正是你方企图以所谓“重行分类”为藉口扣留我方被俘的人员，拒绝将我方的被俘人员全部遣返给我方。假如你方果真有意于解决问题，你方在任何时候就都不应该忘记你方捏造的所谓五万人问题和所谓“重行分类”是我方所坚决不能承认的。你方说，“我们无意扣留你方的人员，我们也不会把那些激烈地反对前往你方的人送回你方”。正如我已经多次指出的，那只是你方企图以不得强迫遣返为藉口，扣留我方被俘人员——这样实际解决不了问题的。我方的立场和理由已经充分表明，也不必在此多说。我方认为尽管我们在若干问题上还未能确定解决办法，但这并不影响或妨害我们已经获有协议的基础。换句话说，我们正应该以已有的成就为基础，逐步推进而不应停止不进或甚至向后倒退。因此，我觉得我方三月五日的发言正确地指出了我们应走的正确的道路。我愿在此重复我那次发言中的一段话：“为了求得合理解决正当的道路，不是推翻已经协议或已确定的材料向后退，而是应该以已经协议或已持有的材料为基础，向前进，以逐步求得问题的解决。因此我们认为双方可以而且应该以已经交换的关于双方收容的战俘材料为基础，首先确定双方在停战后释放与遣返全部战俘的原则”。如果你方关于解决我们之间的现有争执有任何建设性的意见，我们愿意听取。
