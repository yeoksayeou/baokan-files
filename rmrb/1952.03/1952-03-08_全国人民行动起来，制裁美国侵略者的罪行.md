    The Whole Nation Should Act to Punish the Crimes of the American Aggressors
    Disregarding the warnings of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, American imperialism has not only spread a large number of poisonous insects and bacteria on the front and rear lines of Korea, but also spread a large number of poisonous insects and bacteria in Northeast China. This heinous crime against humanity shows that American imperialism is stubbornly and resolutely opposing the people, and dreaming of using this despicable and shameless trick to save its tragic fate in Korea.
    We have not forgotten the bacterial poisoning suffered by the people of Qujia Village, Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, at the hands of Japanese imperialism; we have not forgotten that American imperialism used our captured personnel for bacterial experiments. Today, the American aggressors, in collusion with these Japanese bacterial war criminals who owe us blood debts, are systematically and preparedly spreading bacterial poisonous insects in our country. The Chinese people can never forget these blood debts.
    All medical and health and biological science workers in China, take action! We will not allow American aggressors to use the latest achievements of science for barbaric purposes, and we will not allow brave and hardworking working people to be harmed. We should do a good job in preparing for the prevention and control of infectious bacteria and poisonous insects in a timely manner, and be ready to go to the affected areas to eliminate pests and epidemics at any time, and complete the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the motherland.

    全国人民行动起来，制裁美国侵略者的罪行
    美帝国主义不顾我国人民及全世界爱好和平人民的警告，竟在朝鲜前后方撒布大量毒虫细菌后，又在我国东北撒布大量的毒虫细菌，这种灭绝人性的滔天罪行，说明了美帝国主义正怙恶不悛地坚决与人民为敌，并梦想以这种卑鄙无耻的伎俩来挽回它在朝鲜所遭受的悲惨命运。
    我们并没有忘记黑龙江省安达县鞫家村人民所遭到日本帝国主义的细菌毒害；我们更没有忘掉美帝国主义以我方被俘的人员来作细菌实验。今天美国侵略者又勾结这些血债累累的日本细菌战犯有计划有准备地在我国撒布细菌毒虫，这些血海深仇，中国人民是永不能忘记的。
    全中国的医务卫生及生物科学工作者行动起来吧！我们不容许美国侵略者把科学的最新成果用于野蛮的目的，我们更不容许勇敢勤劳的劳动人民被残害。我们应该及时做好防治传染病菌毒虫的准备工作，随时准备到受害区除害灭疫，完成祖国所交与的光荣任务。
