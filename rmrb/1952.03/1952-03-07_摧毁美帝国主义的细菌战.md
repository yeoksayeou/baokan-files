Destroy the U.S. Imperialists' Germ Warfare
Yang Zhongjian, Director of the Compilation Bureau of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

As the saying goes, "A cornered dog will jump over the wall." The U.S. imperialists' shameless spreading of bacteria in Korea is an act of a cornered dog. They launched a war that was thwarted and are unwilling to accept defeat. They neither learn from their failures nor are willing to negotiate, displaying a rogue-like attitude of delay at the negotiation table. Therefore, they vainly attempt to reverse the situation and intimidate the Chinese and Korean people by spreading bacteria. Isn't this the act of a cornered dog?

However, we must tell the U.S. imperialists that they cannot jump over this wall. This wall is built by the will of peace-loving people around the world and the brave warriors of China and Korea, and it is invincible. Ironically, the U.S. imperialists have always been obsessed with their weapons and have never understood the power of the people. More than a hundred years, especially the lessons of the last ten years, have not made them even slightly aware, thinking that using some special weapons can solve the problem. We should warn them again: your boring germ warfare cannot scare anyone. The atomic bomb not only failed to scare people but scared the imperialists themselves. Won't this boring germ warfare add another failure to the countless records of defeats?

However, from this, we should also gain the necessary understanding and vigilance. That is, we see through that the imperialists will never wake up on their own. Even if germ warfare fails, they will certainly not lay down their butcher knives. That is to say: the imperialists want us to defeat them, and we cannot expect them to defeat themselves. We should unite as one, strengthen our forces, both at the front and in the rear, and build our wall even stronger, not only preventing them from jumping over it but also further destroying all the imperialists' conspiracies and despicable acts. Even if there is any "nonsense war" or "bullshit war" besides bacteria, we are equally determined to deal with it and destroy it!

    摧毁美帝国主义的细菌战
    中国科学院编译局局长  杨钟健
    常言道：“狗急跳墙”。美帝国主义者在朝鲜无耻的撒布细菌就是一种狗急跳墙的行为。他发动起来的战事受到挫败，不肯甘心，既不接受失败中的教训，又不肯讲和，而在会场上表现出无赖的拖延态度。于是妄想用撒布细菌的办法，扭转战局、恐吓中朝人民，这不是狗急跳墙是什么？
    不过我们要告诉美帝国主义者，这墙是跳不过去的。这墙是由全世界爱好和平人民的意志和朝中英勇战士筑成的，是不可战胜的。说来也滑稽，美帝国主义一向迷信他们的武器，从来不认识人民的力量。一百多年，尤其是近十年的教训，并不曾使他有半点觉悟，以为用了什么特殊武器就可以解决问题。我们应该重新警告他：你这个无聊的细菌战是吓不倒人的。原子弹不但吓不倒人，反而吓倒了帝国主义者自己，无聊的细菌战，还不是要在无数失败的记录上再记上一笔吗？
    不过从此我们应该也得到应有的认识和警惕。那就是我们看透了帝国主义者从来不会自己觉悟的。就是细菌战失败，他一定还不肯放下屠刀。那就是说：帝国主义者要我们去打倒他，而不能希望他自己打倒自己。我们应该团结一致，增强我们的力量，无论前方和后方，把我们的墙筑得更坚强，不但让他跳不过，还应该进一步摧毁帝国主义者一切阴谋诡计和卑鄙行为，就是细菌以外还有什么“混账战”、“狗屁战”，我们一样有决心对付它，而且摧毁它！
