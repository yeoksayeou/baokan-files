    International Association of Democratic Lawyers Investigation Team Cables Shen Junru
    Conclusive Evidence of US Military Conducting Germ Warfare
    Chinese and Korean Forces Reconfirm US Military's Planned Germ Warfare from Enemy POW Vaccination Certificates and Confessions
    [Xinhua News Agency, 18th] The investigation team sent by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers to Korea to investigate the truth about the atrocities of the American aggressors, consisting of Brandweiner (Austria), head of the team, Cavaglieri (Italy), deputy head of the team, and members de Brito (Brazil), Gastell (UK), Jascue (France), Ke Bonian (China), Mrs. Morens (Belgium), and Mrs. Wasilkowska (Poland), after obtaining conclusive evidence of the US military's germ warfare in Korea, telegraphed Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court of China, from Pyongyang at 18:10 on March 17. The telegram reads as follows: To Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court of Beijing:
    The investigation team sent by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers to investigate the alleged crimes has completed its investigation in Korea and is now preparing a report. However, we believe it is necessary to urgently inform you: Regarding the accusations against the United States military for conducting germ warfare, we conducted a special investigation. We have obtained evidence and believe the evidence is conclusive that in recent weeks, flies and other insects have been found in many areas which, based on their climatic and soil conditions, their aggregation, and other factors, have never been found in Korea; these insects were found after aircraft circled over these areas and after fragments of containers were recovered, which indicate that the above-mentioned insects were dropped from the air in piles. Experts have discovered that many of these insects are infected with cholera, typhoid, plague, and other diseases. Within days of the discovery of these insects, cholera and plague occurred, and these diseases only occurred in the neighboring areas where these insects had been dropped. We are shocked by these confirmed facts, but we believe these facts are undeniable. We will submit our full report in due course, but in view of the urgency of this matter, we are informing you of these facts and taking the liberty of notifying the press of this telegram. Copies of this telegram have been sent to the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and General Office of the Association.
    Signed: Brandweiner (Austria), Head of the Team
    Cavaglieri (Italy), Deputy Head of the Team
    de Brito (Brazil)
    Gastell (UK)
    Jascue (France)
    Ke Bonian (China)
    Morens (Belgium)

    [Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 18th] The criminal actions of the American aggressor troops in conducting germ warfare in Korea and China have now been further confirmed by the fact that the US military is universally vaccinated. The Chinese and Korean People's Armies recently captured many American and vassal state prisoners of war on the Korean front. Their vaccination certificates and confessions prove that the enemy, in order to carry out inhumane germ warfare in Korea and China, had first universally vaccinated the invading army with vaccines against plague, cholera, typhoid, smallpox, tetanus, epidemic encephalitis B, yellow fever, and eight other diseases. It is particularly noteworthy that cholera has not been found in North Korea since 1947, and plague has never occurred in the history of Korea. As for yellow fever, it is an infectious disease of the Americas and other tropical regions, and Korea and China have never seen this disease at all. So, why did the American aggressor troops universally vaccinate against these infectious diseases that have never been seen in Korea and China on the Korean battlefield? Obviously, anyone with a slightly normal mind would answer this question: the American aggressor troops first vaccinated their invading army in advance in order to spread insects and poisons carrying these germs in Korea and China.

    国际民主法律工作者协会调查团电告沈钧儒
    美军进行细菌战证据确凿
    中朝部队从敌俘预防注射证和口供中再次证实美军有计划地进行细菌战
    【新华社十八日讯】国际民主法律工作者协会派往朝鲜调查美国侵略者暴行真相的调查团团长布兰德魏纳（奥地利）、副团长卡瓦莱里（意大利）、团员狄布里托（巴西）、加斯特尔（英国）、贾斯盖（法国）、柯伯年（中国）、莫伦斯夫人（比利时）、华西尔考夫斯卡夫人（波兰）在获得侵朝美军进行细菌战的确凿证据后，特于三月十七日十八时十分自平壤致电我国最高人民法院院长沈钧儒，电文如下：北京最高人民法院院长沈钧儒：
    国际民主法律工作者协会派来调查被指控之罪行的调查团已经完成其在朝鲜的调查工作，现正在准备报告书。然而我们认为有必要急迫地通知您：关于对美国军队进行细菌战的控诉，我们特别进行了调查。我们已经得到了证据，并认为证据是确凿的，即最近几星期中，在许多地区发现了苍蝇和其他昆虫，按其生存的气候及土壤条件，其结集情况    ，以及其他因素来看，这些种类的昆虫在朝鲜是从来没有的；这些昆虫是在飞机回旋这些地区上空以及检获容器碎片之后发现的，而这些容器碎片说明上述昆虫是一堆堆地从空中投下来的。专家们已经发现：这些昆虫中，有许多染有霍乱、伤寒、鼠疫和他种疾病。在发现这些昆虫后，几天之内就发生了霍乱和鼠疫，而这些疾病只发生在投下过这些昆虫的邻近地区。我们对于所证实的这些事实非常震惊，但是我们认为这些事实是无可争辩的。我们将在一定的时间内提出我们的全部报告，但是鉴于此事的迫切重要性，我们特通知您这些事实，并冒昧地将此电报通知新闻界。此电副本已分致本协会主席、副主席及总会办事处。

    【新华社朝鲜前线十八日电】美国侵略军在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪恶行动，现又从美军中普遍进行预防注射的事实中得到了确切的证明。中朝人民军队最近在朝鲜前线俘获了许多美军和附庸国军的俘虏，从他们的预防注射证和口供中，都证明敌人为了在朝鲜和中国进行灭绝人性的细菌战，曾先在侵略军中普遍的进行了注射，其疫苗计有：鼠疫、霍乱、斑疹伤寒、天花、破伤风、流行性乙型脑炎、黄热病等八种。这里特别值得注意的是北朝鲜自一九四七年以来，就未发现过霍乱病，朝鲜在历史上就未发生过鼠疫，至于黄热病，那是美洲和其他热带地区的传染病，朝鲜和中国根本就没有见过这种病。那么，美国侵略军为什么在朝鲜战场要普遍地注射这些疫苗来预防朝鲜和中国都没有见过的传染病呢？显然只要神经稍微正常一点的人都会解答这个问题：美国侵略军是为了在朝鲜和中国撒布带着这些病菌的昆虫、毒物，才先在侵略军中预作这些疫苗的注射的。
