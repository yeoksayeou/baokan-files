In order to enable literary and art workers to recognize the ugly face of the bourgeoisie from the great struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence, to draw a clear line in ideology, and thus establish the proletarian ideological leadership in literary and art work, the literary and art circles in Shanghai have organized a team of nearly 700 people to participate in Shanghai's "Five-Anti" struggle.

The participation of Shanghai literary and art workers in the "Five-Anti" struggle this time has three purposes: First, to enable literary and art workers to participate in this fierce, face-to-face class struggle, to recognize the reactionary essence of bourgeois ideology, and to lay the foundation for further ideological remolding; second, to create literary and artistic works that struggle against illegal capitalists; and third, as a propaganda team for the "Five-Anti" struggle, to carry out propaganda work in literary and artistic forms.

As of March 22, the literary and art workers participating in this struggle included 23 fine arts workers, 101 music workers, 196 film workers, 180 opera workers, 10 literary writers, 156 drama workers, and 22 general literary and art workers. Among them, screenwriters, directors, and actors from the Shanghai Film Studio and the Shanghai United Film Studio mostly participated in the "Five-Anti" inspection teams and work teams to go deep into the grassroots to work, with the main purpose of going deep into the mass struggle to temper and transform themselves. Opera, music, fine arts workers, and theater troupes, cultural troupes, and film projection teams participated in propaganda teams with propaganda work as their main task. Writers with literary creation experience joined forces with literary writers who came to Shanghai from Beijing to participate in the "Five-Anti" struggle, participating in inspection work on the one hand and experiencing life on the other, in preparation for literary creation.

In order to carry out this work in a planned and organized manner, the Literary and Art Work Committee of the East China Bureau of the CPC conducted in-depth mobilization and organization work in literary and art circles in early March. On March 18, it convened a mobilization meeting of more than 700 people, at which Chen Yi, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, and Pan Hannian, Deputy Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, made mobilization and enlightening reports on the "Five-Anti" movement. Subsequently, each unit also held meetings to enthusiastically study relevant documents, relate to the actual situation in Shanghai, launch discussions, and make further preparations.

After being tempered by this fierce class struggle and improving their ideological understanding in practical tests, the literary and art cadres at the Shanghai Municipal and East China levels in Shanghai will officially begin literary and art rectification studies in May. During the literary and art rectification studies, the main leading cadres of literary and art work in Shanghai and East China will conduct in-depth self-criticism of the literary and art leadership work in the past two years, conduct systematic inspections of past work, and then make plans to improve future work in light of specific circumstances.

    上海文艺工作者近七百人参加“五反”斗争
    为进一步开展思想改造运动奠定基础
    为了使文艺工作者从伟大的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争中认识资产阶级的丑恶面貌，划清思想界限，从而确立文艺工作中的无产阶级思想领导，上海文学艺术界已经组织了一支近七百人的队伍，参加上海市的“五反”斗争。
    这次上海文艺工作者参加“五反”斗争，有三个目的：第一是使文艺工作者参加这一场剧烈的、面对面的阶级斗争，认清资产阶级思想的反动本质，为进一步的思想改造打下基础；第二是创作对违法资本家斗争的文艺作品；第三是作为“五反”斗争的宣传队伍，用文艺形式进行宣传工作。
    截至三月二十二日止，参加这一斗争的文艺工作者已有美术工作者二十三人，音乐工作者一百零一人，电影工作者一百九十六人，戏曲工作者一百八十人，文艺作家十人，戏剧工作者一百五十六人，一般文艺工作者二十二人。其中，上海电影制片厂和上海联合电影厂的编剧、导演、演员，大部以深入群众斗争，锻炼改造自己为主要目的，参加了
    “五反”检查队、工作队深入基层工作。戏曲、音乐、美术工作者和剧团、文工团、电影放映队等，则参加了以宣传工作为主要任务的宣传队伍。有文艺创作经验的作家，则和从北京到上海参加“五反”斗争的文艺作家汇合，一方面参加检查工作，一方面体验生活，准备文艺创作。
    中共中央华东局文艺工作委员会为了有计划有领导地进行这一工作，在三月上旬即在文艺界进行了深入的动员和组织工作。三月十八日，召集了七百余人的动员大会，由中共上海市委书记陈毅及上海市人民政府副市长潘汉年作了有关“五反”运动的动员启发报告。接着各单位也分别召开会议，热烈学习有关文件，联系上海的实际情况，展开讨论，并作了进一步的准备工作。
    经过这一场剧烈的阶级斗争的磨练，在实际考验中提高了思想认识之后，上海市和华东区一级在上海的文艺干部，将在五月间正式开始文艺整风学习。在文艺整风学习中，上海及华东的文艺工作的主要领导干部，将对过去两年多来的文艺领导工作进行深刻的检讨，对过去工作进行有系统的检查，然后联系具体情况，作出改进今后工作的计划。
