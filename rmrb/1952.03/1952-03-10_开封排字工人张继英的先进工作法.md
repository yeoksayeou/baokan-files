The Advanced Work Method of Zhang Jiying, Typesetting Worker in Kaifeng
Li Zhongyuan, Liu Zhaolan

Zhang Jiying, a typesetting worker at the Kaifeng Public Mass Printing Factory, has diligently studied and learned in his work, concentrating the advantages and wisdom of typesetting workers, and created an advanced and scientific method of picking characters, greatly improving work efficiency. From July of the year before last to November of last year, over the course of sixteen months, Zhang Jiying's average number of characters typeset per hour reached more than 2,620, with a maximum of 3,400 characters. His error rate was only 0.13%. After workers at the Mass Printing Factory and Nanyang Printing Factory learned his work method, their work efficiency significantly improved. Now his work method has been comprehensively summarized by the Preparatory Committee of the China News Publishing and Printing Trade Union and the Kaifeng Municipal Federation of Trade Unions.

Three Characteristics of Zhang Jiying's Work Method

The first characteristic of Zhang Jiying's work method is changing the twenty-four-compartment type case to eighteen compartments and making extensive use of "connected strings" of characters. Before liberation, the type cases in most places had twenty-four compartments. Although some workers also felt it was inconvenient to use, very few people made modifications. Zhang Jiying and his co-workers saw this problem and decided to make changes. The administrative side accepted their suggestion. They organized a technical research and improvement group to change the type case to eighteen compartments based on the style of the Zhengzhou Xinhua Bookstore Printing Factory. After the type case was changed, the efficiency of the entire room increased by 30% compared to the past. However, Zhang Jiying was not satisfied with this. One day, he saw his co-worker Chen Jie putting several "base slugs" together, and he remembered seeing typesetting workers at the Xinhua Bookstore in Zhengzhou putting several characters such as "Xinhua News Agency" together. Therefore, he created the "connected string" characters that are widely used today. He filled the lead strips between the compartments on the type case and between two characters within the compartment with "connected string" characters (for example, opening an extra space between the characters "经" [jing - economy/manage] and "济" [ji - economy/aid], and placing a connected string of the two characters "经济" [jingji - economy] ). He also padded these "connected string" characters with a "base slug" in the type case, making the "connected string" characters higher than the characters in the compartment by the height of one character face, so that they could be easily taken out when needed. Zhang Jiying has now made extensive use of this method. On his type case, there are more than 280 kinds of "connected strings" of two characters, eight kinds of three-character strings, and seven kinds of four-character strings. These "connected strings" (partially placed on lead strips) are changed at any time according to the content of the manuscript. For example, when typesetting "Workers' Movement Materials," he puts on "production," "experience," "labor," "record," etc.; if typesetting current affairs propaganda documents, he changes them to "Resist America, Aid Korea," "volunteer," "army," "victory," and so on. Due to the use of "connected string" characters, work efficiency has also been greatly improved. According to Zhang Jiying's own statistics, he can use more than 100 kinds of connected strings for each hand case (twenty lines, 840 characters). Assuming that picking double characters is slightly slower than picking single characters, then at least 70 single characters can be picked more from 100 kinds of "connected strings." Based on Zhang Jiying's average work efficiency, he can pick about 260 more characters per hour. In addition, he kneads the "base slugs" together and places them together (on the right hand side) when returning characters. When encountering blank lines, regardless of length, he can take enough in one or two tries.

The second characteristic of Zhang Jiying's work method is dividing labor between two hands and the left hand automatically retracting the manuscript. This is the main feature of Zhang Jiying's operating method. When picking characters, he puts the hand case in the palm of his left hand (the number of lines in the hand case should be determined according to the size of the hand; Zhang Jiying's is a twenty-line hand case, while the general one is eighteen to nineteen lines), using his thumb and ring finger to clamp it, his index finger and middle finger to clamp the manuscript, and his little finger to support the manuscript. These three fingers can freely move the manuscript up, down, left, and right. This not only eliminates the need for the right hand to help the left hand move the manuscript, but also prevents the occurrence of dropping lines, dropping sentences, dropping characters, and making mistakes. When picking characters, most workers use their right hand to move the manuscript (looking at the text while moving). It usually takes three movements to pick one line. Each time generally takes more than two seconds, with a maximum of fifteen seconds. Chen Jie, who has higher work efficiency (averaging 2,400 characters per hour), uses the method of using the hand to bring the manuscript upward when picking upper-case characters and downward when picking lower-case characters. Each bring takes at least one and a half seconds, which means picking one less character, which means picking 174 fewer characters per hour. If the entire factory calculates at about three seconds each time, each person will pick 348 fewer characters per hour than Zhang Jiying. When Zhang Jiying picks characters, he not only enables the two hands to divide labor, but also keeps the two hands at a certain close distance (about one foot), so that the right hand can immediately put the characters picked from the type case into the left hand's hand case.

Some typesetting workers say that it is faster to look at a sentence at a time when picking characters. However, Zhang Jiying has broken through this old rule. He only looks at two or three characters at a time. Because his two hands always maintain a certain close distance, he can see the characters to be picked next in the blink of an eye when the right hand puts the picked characters into the hand case and when it returns, and the hand immediately points to the characters to be picked. This makes picking characters natural, light, fast, and very regular. Secondly, in the old society, in order to "dawdle" and deal with capitalists, workers always made the thumb knock on the hand case with a loud "clack clack clack" sound, so that it sounded like they were working whether they were working or not. Zhang Jiying abolished this bad habit, because the "clack clack..." sound would easily make him forget to automatically retract and move the manuscript with his fingers. According to the experience of workers at the Mass Printing Factory when learning his work method, attention must be paid to this point.

Zhang Jiying's standing and movement posture when picking characters are also different from others. Zhang Jiying's posture when working is standing in a moderate place in front of the type case, and he rarely moves around (unless he moves to another place to find rare characters, and when he moves, he also runs in small steps). Generally, he stands in a at-ease position with his legs crossed, his chest slightly forward, and he moves up and down in a bow-legged manner when working. For example, when he takes the characters in the upper right corner of the case, he slightly leans his right foot forward, slightly leans his body forward, raises his left heel, and extends his hands diagonally to the upper right corner to take the characters he wants to pick; if he takes the characters in the upper left corner, he does the opposite by slightly leaning his left foot forward, raising his right heel, and extending his hands diagonally to the upper left corner; when taking the characters in the middle, he does not move his original posture, spreads his knees outward, does not bow his waist, and uses a sitting chair posture; if picking the characters in the lower part of the type case, he slightly retracts his left foot, opens his knees outward, and still takes the sitting chair posture, but it is a bit lower than when taking the characters in the middle. Because of this, he is able to keep his hands at a certain close distance at all times. Some workers take a few steps forward when taking the upper part, and then have to retreat several steps when taking the lower part of the characters, and bend their waists like a bow. This forward and backward movement, bending and straightening the waist, not only tires people, but also delays time.

Zhang Jiying not only has the above three main work characteristics, but also has a basic condition for doing a good job. He concentrates his energy and thoughts when working, and usually pays attention to learning from other workers. This is also the basic reason why he can concentrate the wisdom of the masses to create advanced work methods. For example, in his work, he saw Chen Jie inadvertently put a few individual "base slugs" together, and he thought of the problem of making extensive use of connected strings of characters. In addition, he is able to break through old rules and make bold creations. The workers used to knock their thumbs on the hand case with a "clack clack" sound, which was originally a trick to deal with capitalists in the old society and had long become a habit of typesetting workers in our country. However, when it was passed on to Zhang Jiying, he immediately thought: "Now it is a new society, we are working for our own factory!" Therefore, he unceremoniously abandoned this stale and outdated old thing. Therefore, when we learn Zhang Jiying's work method, we must also humbly learn his tireless learning spirit; learn his ability to concentrate the wisdom of the masses; and learn his spirit of daring to abandon old rules and create boldly.

Zhang Jiying's Work Method Significantly Improves Typesetting Efficiency

After Zhang Jiying's work method spread, workers from all over the country sent letters of congratulations and unanimously requested to learn his work method. At the Mass Printing Factory, thanks to the attention of the leadership, a wave of learning Zhang Jiying's work method has been created. The Kaifeng Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has been promoting it in the printing industry throughout the city. In the process of promotion, many difficulties were encountered. First, the workers' ideological resistance. Some people thought: "Isn't typesetting a handicraft? What method can be created?" Some said: "It is impossible to pick 3,400 characters per hour. Isn't that just瞎吹的? Or is it just拼死的干; if he can create it, so can we, as long as we risk our lives to do it, what do we need to learn from him!" Some satirized and attacked Zhang Jiying, saying that he: "Picks more to get more人民币." Some said: "He picks more because he has a strong personality and his hands are fast." Some even emphasized: "The conditions are different, we can't learn his method." Some workers were ideologically conservative. When Zhang Jiying was teaching a apprentice, he secretly watched from the side. After he learned it, he didn't admit that he had learned it, but said "I can also do it!" The leadership seized the opportunity to conduct ideological education for everyone: holding forums to discuss ideological understanding, conducting self-criticism, and explaining that learning advanced work methods is responding to Chairman Mao's call to increase wealth for the country; conducting individual talks to dispel ideological concerns; and organizing advanced workers to learn, make achievements for everyone to see, and promptly commended workers who made rapid progress in learning. The ideological obstacles of everyone gradually disappeared. At the forum for promoting Zhang Jiying's work method in the Kaifeng printing industry, many workers who were learning Zhang Jiying's work method made ideological self-examinations. Liu Shaowu said: "I used to feel that there was not much hope in typesetting, and I thought that there could be no improvement in our industry. When Zhang Jiying picked 1,800 characters, I said that was all there was to it, any faster would be exhausting. Later, when Zhang Jiying picked more than 3,000 characters, I felt very strange. When he was teaching apprentices to learn, I secretly watched from the side, thinking that there could be no progress even if he taught them. Later, I tried it with Zhang Jiying's method of automatically retracting the manuscript and I was convinced. I picked two or three hundred more characters per hour, and it was also less strenuous." Since the factory began to learn Zhang Jiying's work method, work efficiency has significantly improved. Chen Jie, Shi Baocheng, and other seven workers have improved their average picking rate by more than 300 characters after learning his work method. If the total number of workers in the factory is calculated, the average number of characters picked per person per hour before September last year was 1,814, while the total average number for October and November increased to 1,956 characters, and the average number for the first half of December increased to 2,050 characters per hour; if all the workers had learned it, then the total average would be 2,375 characters; if all the workers had reached Zhang Jiying's level of proficiency, then the total average would be more than 2,600 characters per person per hour.

Zhang Jiying's work method not only creates high value for the country, but also opens up a bright road for printing workers across the country.

    开封排字工人张继英的先进工作法
    李中原  刘兆兰
    开封市公营大众印刷厂排字工人张继英，在工作中虚心钻研学习，集中排字工人优点和智慧，创造了一种先进的科学的拣字工作法，大大地提高了工作效率。张继英从前年七月到去年十一月的十六个月中，拣字数量平均每小时达到二千六百二十多个字，最高时达到三千四百字。他的错字率只占千分之一点三。大众印刷厂和南阳印刷厂工人学习他的工作法后，工作效率都显著地提高了。现在他的工作方法已由中国新闻出版印刷工会筹备委员会和开封市总工会进行了全面的总结。
    张继英工作方法的三个特点
    张继英工作法的特点之一是改二十四盘字架为十八盘，大量运用“连串”字。在解放前各地的字架大部是二十四盘的。有些工人虽然也觉得用着不方便，但却很少人来进行改造。张继英和同他在一起工作的工友看出了这个毛病，就决心进行改造。行政方面接受了他们的建议。他们组织了技术研究改进组，把字盘根据郑州新华书店印刷厂的样式改为十八盘。字架改成后，全房工作效率较过去提高了百分之三十。但张继英并未以此为满足，有一天他看见工友陈捷把几个“底铅”放在一起，他就想起过去在郑州见到新华书店拣字工人把“新华社”等几个字放在一起的事情来，因此就创造了今天大量运用的“连串”字。他在字架上盘与盘之间的铅条上，和盘内两个字之间都摆满了“连串”字，（比如“经”“济”两字之间再另开辟一空格，放进一连串的“经济”二字）。并把这些“连串”字在字盘内垫上一个“底铅”，使“连串”字比盘上字高出一个字面，用时顺手即可取出。张继英现在已大量利用这个方法，在他的字架上有两个字的“连串”的二百八十余种，三字连串的八种，四字连串的七种。这些“连串”（是放在铅条上的一部分）的字是根据稿件内容的不同随时调换的，比如排“工人运动资料”时他就摆上“生产”“经验”“劳动”“纪录”等；如果要排时事宣传文件时，他就换上“抗美援朝”“志愿”“军队”“胜利”等等。由于利用“连串”字，工作效率也大大地提高了。以张继英本人统计，他每拣一手盘（二十行，八百四十字），就能利用上一百种以上的连串字。假如说拣双字比拣单字稍慢一点，那么一百种“连串”字中最少也可多捏七十个单字。以张继英的平均工作效率计算，每小时即可多捏二百六十个字左右。另外，他又把“底铅”在还字时捏好摆在一起（右手旁），遇见空行，不论长短，一次或两次即可取够。
    张继英工作法的特点之二是两手分工，左手自动抽退稿子。这是张继英操作方法的主要特点。他在捏字时是把手盘放在左手心里（手盘应根据手的大小确定行数，张继英的是二十行手盘，一般的是十八行至十九行），用大拇指和无名指跟挟着，食指和中指挟着稿纸，小指拖扶着稿纸，这三个指头可以上下左右自由移动稿纸。这样不但不需要再用右手去帮助左手移动稿纸，而且也不会发生掉行、掉句、掉字和错字的毛病。一般工友捏字时都是用右手去移动稿纸（移动时看文），普通捏一行要移动三次。每次一般要占二秒钟以上时间，最多有达十五秒的。工作效率较高的陈捷（每小时平均捏二千四百字），用捏上盘字把稿随手向上带，下盘向下带的方法，每带一次至少也需要一秒半钟，就要少捏一个字，一小时就要少捏一百七十四个字。如全厂均以一次需三秒钟左右计算，每人每小时就要比张继英少拣三百四十八个字。张继英在拣字时，不但能使两只手分工，同时还能使两只手永远保持一定的近距离（约在一英尺左右），右手在字架上取了字立刻就能放在左手的手盘内。
    有些拣字工人说，拣时看稿子一下看一句才能快。然而张继英却突破了这种旧规程，他每次不看多，只看两三个字。由于他两只手一直保持着一定的近距离，所以在右手把拣到的字向手盘里放以及在它返回的转瞬空隙即可看到接着要拣的字，手就立刻又指到要拣的字上去。这样拣起来自然、轻快而又非常有规律。其次，在旧社会里工友们为“磨洋工”对付资本家，工作时总是把大拇指在手盘上敲得咋咋咋的响，干活不干活，听起来都像干活一样。而张继英废除了这种恶习，因为“呱呱……”的敲会容易忘记指头的自动抽退移动稿子。据大众印刷厂工友学习他的工作方法时的经验，必须注意这一点。
    张继英捏字时的站立和动作姿势和别人也不同。张继英工作时的姿势是站在字架前适中的地方，轻易不乱动（除非到别处找稀字时动，动时也是跑细步）。一般都是稍息式的叉腿站，胸部稍向前倾，工作时是罗圈式的上下。如他拿右上盘角的字时，是右脚稍向前趋，身体稍向前倾，左脚跟跷起，两手斜向右上角伸即可取到捏的字；如拿左上角的字，就反之以左脚稍向前趋，右脚跟跷起两手向左上角斜伸；拿中部字时，是原姿势不动，两膝向外张，不鞠腰，用坐椅式；如果拣字盘下部，左角的字就将左脚稍向后撤，膝盖向外开，仍拿坐椅式的姿势，不过比拿中部字时更要低一些罢了。正因为这样，他才有可能使两手永远保持着一定的近距离。有些工友在拿上部时就向前进几步，拿下部字时又得后退数步，并把腰鞠得像弓一样，这样前走后退，弯腰直腰，直而再弯，不但累人，而且也耽误时间。
    张继英不但具备以上三个主要的工作特点，而且他还有一个做好工作的基本条件。他在工作时精力集中，思想集中，平常注意向别的工友学习，这也是他能够集中群众智慧创造先进工作方法的基本原因。譬如在工作中他看见陈捷把几个个别的“底铅”无意中放到一起，他就想起了大量利用连串字的问题。另外就是他能够突破旧规程，进行大胆的创造，拣字时工人把大拇指头在手盘上“呱呱”的敲响，原是在旧社会对付资本家的一种手腕，早已成了我国拣字工人的一种习惯了，然而传到了张继英的身上，他就立刻想到：“现在是新社会了，我们是对自己的工厂干活呀！”因而他毫不姑息地抛弃了这种陈腐的早已不合时宜的旧东西。因此，我们学习张继英工作方法时，还要虚心学习他的孜孜不倦的学习精神；学习他善于集中群众智慧；学习他的勇于抛弃旧规程大胆创造的精神。
    张继英工作法使排字的工作效率显著提高
    张继英工作方法传出以后，全国各地工友都纷纷来信祝贺，并一致要求学习他的工作方法。在大众印刷厂，由于领导方面的重视，已造成了学习张继英工作方法的热潮。开封市总工会已在全市印刷业进行推广。在推广过程中是遇到很多困难的，首先是工人的思想抵触，有的认为：“捏字还不是个手工业，能创造个啥方法？”有的说：“每小时捏三千四百字根本不可能，还不是瞎吹的，要不就是拚死的干；那他能创造咱也能创造，只要拚上命干就行了，还要什么向他学习！”有的则讽刺打击张继英，说他：“捏的多，为了多拿几张人民币。”有的说：“他捏的多，因为他的个性强，出手就是快的。”甚至有人强调：“条件不一样，我们学不来他的法。”有些工友思想保守，张继英教学工，他就在
    一旁偷着看，等学会了，他又不承认是学来的，而说“咱也会吗！”领导方面就抓紧对大家进行思想教育：召开座谈会座谈思想认识，进行自我批判，并说明学习先进工作方法就是响应毛主席的号召，为国家增加财富；进行个别谈话解除思想顾虑；又组织先进工友学习，作出成绩给大家看，并及时地表扬了学习进步快的工人，大家的思想障碍逐渐消除了。在开封市印刷业推广张继英工作方法的座谈会上，很多学习张继英工作方法的工人都作了思想检讨。刘少武说：“我过去觉着干排字没有多大希望，以为我们这行不可能有什么改进。在张继英拣到一千八百字的时候，我说只能这样了，再快就要累死。后来张继英拣到三千多字，我就觉得很奇怪。他教学徒学习时，我就偷偷地在一旁看，心想再教也不可能有什么长进。后来用了张继英自动抽退稿子的方法试验了一下可服气了，我每小时多拣二、三百字，而且又省力气。”自本厂开展学习张继英工作方法后，工作效率都显著地提高了。陈捷、史保成等七位工友学习他的工作方法后，一般捏字率都提高了三百字以上。如以全厂工人总合计算，去年九月份以前每人每小时平均为一千八百一十四字，而十、十一两个月总平均数增为一千九百五十六个字，十二月上半月增为每时平均二千零五十字；假如全体工友都进行了学习，那么总平均就要为二千三百七十五个字；假如全体工友的熟练程度都赶上张继英，那么总平均每人每小时就要拣二千六百字以上。
    张继英的工作方法，不但给国家创造了很高的价值，同时也给全国印刷工人开辟了光明的道路。
