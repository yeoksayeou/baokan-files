Brief Commentary on Economic Life

　　It is essential to highly value the production enthusiasm of the working masses
　　Although some leading cadres of enterprises generally understand that "relying on the working class to do a good job in production" is our fundamental policy for managing enterprises, in actual life and daily work, they often underestimate the level of awareness and creativity of the masses, and even completely disregard the opinions and demands of the masses, only carrying out work according to their own subjective requirements. In this way, they naturally cannot truly implement the policy of "relying on the working class to do a good job in production". Last winter, the workers of the Pingxiang Coal Mine enthusiastically demanded to increase production with a master's attitude, and even spontaneously created new records and learned advanced experience, but the leadership was afraid of "hindering the central work" and did not lead and support them. When the masses actively demand to increase production, the leading cadres ignore them, and the production enthusiasm of the masses will inevitably cool down. After the "central work" is completed, when the leading cadres go to mobilize the masses to launch competitions to create new records, they will of course encounter many difficulties, causing losses to production.
　　This lesson should be especially noted by leading cadres of enterprises today. In the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the class consciousness of the broad masses of workers has been greatly improved, and what follows must be a surge in production enthusiasm. At this time, if the leading cadres do not cherish the enthusiasm of the masses and fail to organize the masses in a timely manner to fight for the realization and surpassing of the increase production and practice economy plan, they will definitely fall behind the masses, and may even hinder the completion of the increase production and practice economy plan.

　　Correcting Formalism in Promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method
　　Most leading cadres of cotton textile factories have organized the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method very carefully, and thus have achieved great results. The state-owned Shanghai No. 11 Cotton Textile Factory is one of them. Before the promotion, the factory's leading cadres carried out ideological education for the workers, repeatedly publicizing the political and economic significance of implementing the Hao Jianxiu work method. At the same time, under the unified leadership of the Party, a promotion group including administration, trade union, and the Communist Youth League was formed to actively and meticulously carry out preparatory work. During the promotion, they first gained experience from typical groups, using vivid and successful examples to educate those workers who doubted the Hao Jianxiu work method and had no confidence, further eliminating ideological obstacles during the comprehensive promotion. The leading cadres helped the trainees solve the difficult problems encountered in learning at any time, and gave them the necessary material conditions. Therefore, this factory smoothly promoted the Hao Jianxiu work method.
　　Some factory leading cadres used formalistic methods to promote the Hao Jianxiu work method. They did not deeply study the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu work method, neglected to carry out ideological education for the workers, and did not make sufficient preparations, but were only enthusiastic about the superficial "vigorous". As a result of the inspection by the Northeast Textile Industry Administration Bureau and the Northeast Regional Committee of the China Textile Trade Union in textile factories in Wafangdian, Jinzhou, Dalian, Yingkou, and Shenyang, it was found that most factories "comprehensively launched" the promotion of this advanced work method from the beginning: the leading cadres held a meeting, or gave a few classes, and then thought that everything was fine, so they handed over all the promotion work to the "little teachers". The "little teachers" encountered difficulties in their work, and the leading cadres did not care about it. Some factories regarded the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method as a shock movement, "promoted" it for a month, and awarded each learning worker a small apron with the words "Hao Jianxiu Worker", and then thought that it was "almost done". Some factory leading cadres were satisfied with the number of "Hao Jianxiu Workers", but did not check the situation of the workers implementing the Hao Jianxiu work method. There were also some factory leading cadres who did not educate the workers to truly grasp the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu work method, but simply emphasized reducing the leather roller flowers. They believed that as long as the leather roller flowers were reduced, they had learned the Hao Jianxiu work method, regardless of how the leather roller flowers were reduced. In this way, although the leather roller flowers were reduced on the surface, they were thrown into the velvet roller flowers, the sweeping oily cotton, or even thrown into the toilets, canteens, and dormitories. The leading cadres not only did not study and correct this phenomenon, but thought it was an "inevitable phenomenon". This method of promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method not only cannot improve production, but also causes greater waste, creating a very bad influence among the masses. Textile trade unions in various places should check the promotion of the Hao Jianxiu work method at any time, and thoroughly correct this formalistic bad style of work.

    经济生活简评
    要十分珍视工人群众的生产热情
    有些企业领导干部虽然一般地懂得了“依靠工人阶级搞好生产”是我们管理企业的根本方针，但是他们在实际生活和日常工作中，却常常过低地估计群众的觉悟程度和创造力量，甚至根本不重视群众的意见和要求，而只是按照自己的主观要求进行工作。这样，自然就不能真正贯彻“依靠工人阶级搞好生产”的方针了。去冬萍乡煤矿的工人们满怀热情地以主人翁的态度要求提高生产，甚至自发地在创造新纪录和学习先进经验，但领导方面却怕“妨碍中心工作”，不去领导和支持。群众积极要求提高生产的时候，领导干部置之不理，群众的生产热情必然冷下来。“中心工作”搞完了，领导干部再去发动群众展开竞赛创造新纪录时，当然要遇到很多困难，使生产受到损失。
    这种教训，在今天特别应该引起企业领导干部的注意。在伟大的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中，广大职工的阶级觉悟已经大大提高，随之而来的必是生产积极性的高涨。这时候，假如领导干部不珍视群众的热情，不能适时地组织群众为实现和超过增产节约计划而斗争，那就一定会落在群众的后面，甚至会妨碍增产节约计划的完成。
    纠正在推广郝建秀工作法中的
    形式主义
    多数棉纺织厂的领导干部，都十分慎重地组织了郝建秀工作法的推广工作，因而收到了很大的成绩。国营上海第十一棉纺织厂就是其中的一个。在推广以前，厂的领导干部对工人进行了思想教育，反覆宣传了实行郝建秀工作法的政治意义和经济意义。同时，在党的统一领导下，组成包括行政、工会、青年团的推广组，积极地周密地进行了筹备工作。在推广时，他们先从典型组取得经验，用活的成功的范例来教育那些怀疑郝建秀工作法的和没有信心的工人，进一步扫除了全面推广时的思想障碍。领导干部随时帮助学员解决在学习中遇到的疑难问题，并给以必要的物质条件。因此，这个厂顺利地推广了郝建秀工作法。
    有些厂的领导干部却是用形式主义的方法推广郝建秀工作法的。他们不深入研究郝建秀工作法的精神，忽视对工人进行思想教育，又不作充分的准备工作，而只热心于表面上的“轰轰烈烈”。如东北纺织工业管理局、中国纺织工会东北区委员会在瓦房店、金州、大连、营口、沈阳等纺织厂检查的结果，发现大部分厂在推广这一先进工作法时，都是一开始就“全面铺开”了：领导干部召开一个大会，或上了几次课后，便认为万事大吉了，于是把全部推广工作交给“小先生”去做。“小先生”在工作中遇到困难，领导干部也不过问。有的厂把推广郝建秀工作法当作一个突击运动，“推”了一个月，奖给每个学习的工人一件有“郝建秀工作者”字样的小围裙，就认为已经“差不多”了。有些厂的领导干部满足于“郝建秀工作者”的数字，对工人执行郝建秀工作法的情形却不加以检查。还有些厂的领导干部，不教育工人真正掌握郝建秀工作法精神，而单纯强调降低皮辊花。他们认为只要皮辊花减少了就算学会了郝建秀工作法，而不问皮辊花究竟是怎样减少的。这样皮辊花在表面上虽然减少了，但它被扔到绒辊花、扫地油棉里去了，甚至被扔到厕所、食堂、宿舍里去了。领导干部对这种现象不但不加以研究和纠正，反认为这是“不可避免的现象”。这种推广郝建秀工作法的方法，不仅不能提高生产，反而造成了更大的浪费，在群众中造成很坏的影响。各地纺织工会，应随时检查郝建秀工作法的推广工作，彻底纠正这种形式主义的恶劣作风。
