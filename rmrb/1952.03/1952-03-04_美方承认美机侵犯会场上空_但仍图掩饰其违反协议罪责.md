Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 3rd: This reporter reports: On the 2nd, U.S. Liaison Officer Kinney sent a memorandum to our Chief Liaison Officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, admitting that on February 24th, at approximately 1:00 PM, four U.S. military Meteor jet aircraft flew over the Panmunjom conference area. The memorandum "expressed regret" for this violation of the agreement. However, using the same lie as in the January 17th bombing of the Kaesong neutral zone, where they "mistook bombs for fuel tanks," they claimed that this violation of the agreement was the result of "technical conditions" beyond the U.S. military's "control."

    美方承认美机侵犯会场上空
    但仍图掩饰其违反协议罪责
    【新华社开城三日电】本社记者报道：二日美方联络官肯尼致我方首席联络官张春山上校备忘录一件，承认二月二十四日下午约一时曾有美军流星喷气式飞机四架飞越板门店会场区上空。该备忘录对这一违反协议事件“表示遗憾”。但又以一月十七日美机轰炸开城中立区那样“误将炸弹作为油箱”的同样谎言，说这次违反协议事件是“由于技术条件”超出美军“控制”的结果。
