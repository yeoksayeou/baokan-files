Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: The review and handling of the first, second, and third categories of industrial and commercial businesses in Beijing's "Five-Anti" movement has basically concluded. As of the 28th, the municipal districts' economy inspection committees had announced the conclusions for over 40,000 businesses. Among them, some originally belonged to the fourth category but, due to their relatively thorough confessions and active denunciation of other law-breaking businesses, received a lenient, one-level reduction in classification. The broad masses of industrial and commercial businesses throughout the city deeply support the people's government's handling, and those who have already received their conclusions are especially grateful. They have stated that they will certainly abide by government decrees and engage in legitimate business operations in the future. Currently, these businesses that have received conclusions are actively participating in "tiger-hunting teams," joining workers in encircling and suppressing the few seriously law-breaking and completely law-breaking businesses that still refuse to honestly confess.

The relevant departments in Beijing made full preparations beforehand to review the investigation and processing forms of industrial and commercial businesses' illegal activities. Therefore, from filling out the forms to the review at each stage, the process was generally very serious, and most industrial and commercial businesses supplemented their confessions with materials about their illegal activities during the review process.

When organizing industrial and commercial businesses to fill out the forms this time, the economy inspection committees of each district, in addition to holding industrial and commercial business conferences in advance to explain policies and detail how to fill out the forms, also trained a large number of cadres and assigned them to industrial and commercial business study groups to guide them in filling out the forms. Some districts temporarily organized propaganda and review groups to explain policies and guide the filling out of forms, while also requiring businesses to refill forms that were filled out incorrectly or unclearly.

After the forms were filled out, they were first submitted to the industrial and commercial business study groups for review. Everyone was generally serious and responsible during the review. Law-abiding businesses and those with minor problems, or those who had thoroughly confessed even if the problems were significant, were even more active. Therefore, many law-breaking businesses had to supplement their confessions with their problems when passing this stage.

The review by workers, shop assistants, and accountants played a huge role in the entire review process. In order to mobilize every employee to actively guard this most important stage, trade unions in each district and industry held "guarding oath-taking rallies," "accountant training classes," or "senior staff return to the ranks rallies" in advance. At these conferences, the employees studied the review, established guarding covenants and plans, and launched guarding competitions. At the same time, trade unions in each district and industry universally rectified their organizations, purged bad elements who had been sent in and pulled over by the bourgeoisie, and absorbed a large number of activists who emerged during the movement to join the trade unions, promoting many highly conscious and capable individuals to leadership positions. During the movement, the number of new members absorbed by trade unions in various industries throughout the city reached more than 32,000, according to incomplete statistics. In the work of reviewing industrial and commercial businesses, under the leadership of the trade unions, the employees investigated materials, studied the situation, and often worked past midnight before resting, resolutely blocking the law-breaking capitalists who vainly attempted to "break through," "feel their way through," or "muddle through." Taking the Sixth District, where commerce and industry were most concentrated, as an example, approximately 80-90% of those in the printing industry, 50% in the department store industry, and 30% in the cultural and educational supplies industry were forced to confess new materials or supplement their confessions with problems.

After these forms were reviewed and passed by the district trade union offices, the economy inspection committees in each district verified the accusation materials from various parties, classified and handled them separately according to each business's illegal situation, confession situation, and the review opinions of the employees and industrial and commercial business study groups. The processing steps were to hold district-wide typical handling conferences, first handling a batch, and then holding conferences separately by industry to conduct large-scale processing. At the district-wide typical handling conferences, the district economy inspection committees announced in public that those law-breaking industrial and commercial businesses who confessed thoroughly and actively denounced others would be given a one-level reduction in classification; those law-breaking industrial and commercial businesses who stubbornly resisted the movement would be arrested on the spot by the government. These typical handling conferences had a great impact. Many law-breaking industrial and commercial businesses changed their attitude of resisting the movement after the conferences and confessed their illegal activities.

    北京市处理前三类工商户的工作基本结束
    广大工商户感激政府的从宽处理
    【新华社二十九日讯】北京市“五反”运动的审查和处理一、二、三类工商户的工作已基本结束。截至二十八日为止，全市已有四万多户分别由各区节约检查委员会宣布了处理结论。其中有一部分原属第四类户，因坦白比较彻底并能积极检举其他违法户，获得降一级的宽大处理。全市广大工商业户对人民政府的处理深为拥护，已经作了处理结论的工商户尤其感激万分。他们纷纷表示：今后一定遵守政府法令，从事正当经营。目前，这些已作了结论的工商户，积极参加“打虎队”，正和工人一起向少数至今尚不肯老实坦白的严重违法户和完全违法户进行围剿。
    北京市各有关方面为了审查工商户违法事实调查处理表，事先都做了充分的准备。因此，从填表到各道关口的审查，一般都很认真，大部分工商户在审查过程中补充交代了违法的材料。
    各区节约检查委员会在这次组织工商户填表时，除了事先召开工商业户大会交代政策，详细说明填表方法外，并训练了大批干部，分配到各工商户学习小组去指导他们填写表格。有的区临时组织了宣传、审查等组，一面解释政策，指导填表，一面把填得不对或不清楚的表格要工商户重填。
    表格填写完毕，首先交工商户学习小组审查。大家在审查时一般是比较认真负责的。守法户和问题不大或者问题虽大却已经彻底交代的工商户，表现得更为积极。因此，不少违法的工商户在通过这一关时，不得不补充交代自己的问题。
    工人店员和会计的审查，在整个审查过程中起了极大的作用。为了动员每一个职工积极把住这个最重要的一关，各区各行业工会事先都分别举行了“把关誓师大会”、“会计训练班”或“高级职员归队大会”。在这些大会上，职工们对审查作了研究，订立了把关公约和把关计划，并发动把关竞赛。同时各区各行业工会普遍整顿了组织，把资产阶级派进来和拉过去的坏分子清除出去，吸收运动中涌现出来的大批积极分子参加工会，把许多觉悟较高能力较强的分子提拔到领导机关中来。在运动中，全市各业工会吸收的新会员据不完全的统计共达三万二千多人。在审查工商户的工作中，职工们在工会领导下调查材料，研究情况，经常工作到午夜以后才休息，给了那些妄想“闯关”“摸关”“混关”的违法资本家以坚决阻击。以工商业最集中的第六区为例，印刷业中有百分之八、九十，百货业中有百分之五十，文教用品业中有百分之三十左右，被迫交代了新的材料，或补充交代了问题。
    这些表格经过区工会办事处审查通过以后，各区节约检查委员会就对证各方面的检举材料，根据各户违法的情况、坦白的情况、职工们和工商户学习小组的审查意见进行分类，分别处理。处理的步骤是召开全区性的典型处理大会，首先处理一批，然后按行业分别召开大会，进行大批的处理。在全区的典型处理大会上，区节约检查委员会当众宣布：对一些坦白彻底并积极检举的违法工商户，予以降一级处理；对少数顽强抗拒运动的违法工商户，由政府当场予以逮捕。这种典型处理大会有很大的影响。不少的违法工商户在会后转变了抗拒运动的态度，交代了他们的违法事实。
