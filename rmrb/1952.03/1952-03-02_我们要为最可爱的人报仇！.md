    We must avenge the most beloved people!
    Beijing Electric Tram Company Electric Tram Repair Factory All Employees
    Recently, various regions have successively exposed the heinous crimes of unscrupulous capitalists who are anti-people, betraying the motherland, and plotting against the Volunteer Army. After seeing this news, we feel infinite indignation towards the crimes of these奸商 [unscrupulous merchants].
    "Resisting America and Aiding Korea is the greatest interest of the people of the whole country!" We deeply realized this during the widespread Resist America and Aid Korea education campaign last year, and the entire Chinese working class realized it. Only those inhuman illegal capitalists and big奸商 [unscrupulous merchants] completely disregard this point and instead take the opportunity to make "Resist America and Aid Korea" profits, plotting against the Volunteer Army. This behavior is as vicious and cruel as that of hidden counter-revolutionary elements.
    On January 24th, the delegation of Volunteer Army returning heroes came to our factory to give a report, introducing their heroic deeds of killing the enemy on the Korean front: In the battle of Gaotai Mountain, eight Volunteer Army soldiers repelled the enemy's thirteen attacks in a row, successfully completing the tasks assigned by their superiors. The American imperialist aggressors cannot defeat our most beloved people, but the hateful奸商 [unscrupulous merchants] are helping the American army to attack from behind, so that many Volunteer Army comrades were crippled when they shouldn't have been, and sacrificed when they shouldn't have. This blood debt must be repaid.
    In the past six months, more than 500 employees in our factory have regarded the factory as a battlefield, and everyone has worked doubly hard to produce. Some volunteered to work overtime, some donated wages, some donated wedding rings... Everyone wanted to support the Volunteer Army more. We tightened our belts and worked hard for several months, donating more than 23 million yuan; but the evil奸商 [unscrupulous merchant] Li Yinting stole 1.8 billion yuan from the donations of the people of the whole country in one go, which is dozens of times more than the total amount donated by the employees of our factory with all their efforts. This is something we can never tolerate.
    We—more than 500 employees of the Electric Tram Repair Factory, with gnashing teeth and hatred, denounce these accomplices of American imperialism, the evil奸商 [unscrupulous merchants]. We demand that the government impose the death penalty on these奸商 [unscrupulous merchants] to avenge our most beloved people who were harmed! We must take more active actions in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and resolutely suppress the bourgeoisie's offensive.

    我们要为最可爱的人报仇！
    北京市电车公司电车修造厂全体职工
    最近各地陆续揭露了不法资本家反人民、叛祖国、暗害志愿军的滔天罪行。我们在看到这些消息以后，对奸商的这些罪行感到无限的愤慨。
    “抗美援朝是全国人民的最大利益！”这句话我们在去年普遍开展的抗美援朝教育中深刻地认识到了，全中国的工人阶级都认识到了。只有那些没有人性的违法资本家、大奸商，他们丝毫不理会这一点，反而乘机发“抗美援朝”财，暗害志愿军，这行为和暗藏的反革命分子一样毒辣，一样凶狠。
    一月二十四日，志愿军归国代表团曾到我们厂里来作报告，介绍他们在朝鲜前线英勇杀敌的事迹：在高台山战役中，八个志愿军战士，接连打退了敌人的十三次进攻，圆满地完成了上级所给的任务。美帝国主义侵略军打不倒我们最可爱的人，可恶的奸商们却帮助美军从背后来进行袭击，以致许多志愿军同志不该残废的残废了，不该牺牲的牺牲了。这笔血债一定要索还。
    我们全厂五百多个职工在过去的半年里，把工厂当成战场，大家加倍努力地生产，有的义务加班，有的捐工资，有的献结婚戒指……，人人都想更多地支援志愿军。我们节衣缩食，辛辛苦苦几个月，捐了两千三百多万元；但是万恶的奸商李寅廷一次便从全国人民的捐款中盗去十八亿元，这比我厂职工竭尽全力捐献的总数要大几十倍。这是我们决不能容忍的事。
    我们——电车修造厂五百多职工，怀着切齿的痛恨，控诉这些美帝国主义的帮凶，万恶的奸商。我们要求政府对这些奸商处以极刑，为被暗害的我们最可爱的人报仇！我们要在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中，更积极地行动起来，坚决把资产阶级的进攻压下去。
