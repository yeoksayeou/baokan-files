Withdrawing "Body Shares" and "Property Shares," Never to be Fooled Again
    ——A Record of the Stock Withdrawal Meeting of Workers in the Zhangjiakou City Flour Industry
    Wang Qi  Li Xiaocheng
    On February 26th, over 400 employees from the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh branches of the Zhangjiakou City Flour Industry Union and the Yongfeng Flour Mill grassroots union held a worker stock withdrawal meeting. Managers from twenty flour mills, including Demingwang, Shixingkui, and Yongfeng, personally held their "Ten Thousand Gold Treasure Ledgers," which they never easily brought out, and listened to the workers' righteous accusations. After more than twenty worker representatives accused the capitalists of enticing and deceiving workers into buying shares, cruelly exploiting workers, blurring workers' class consciousness, and dividing working-class solidarity, fifty-four workers with "body shares" or "property shares" personally used brushes dipped in thick ink to cross out their names on the "Ten Thousand Gold Treasure Ledgers" held by the capitalists, returning to the ranks of the working class.
    Worker representatives at the meeting exposed the capitalists' insidious and vicious means of enticing workers to purchase shares.
    There are 378 employees in the privately-owned flour industry in Zhangjiakou City, of whom 54 hold labor or property shares. Shareholding generally occurred in shops with "sole owner" and "joint owner" systems. A "sole owner" system means one owner provides the capital and hires a manager, with profits distributed every three years, as in the case of Demingwang Flour Store. "Joint ownership" means several owners provide the capital and also serve as managers or deputy managers, with profits distributed annually, as in the case of Deqingheng Flour Mill.
    "Shareholding" is divided into two types: money shares and body shares. Capitalists mainly let workers hold body shares to make them loyal slaves, working diligently for them. The general method is "dual inducement of fame and profit." Capitalists would say, "If you hold body shares, you shop assistants become owners too, and you will also benefit if the business makes a fortune." Wang Yu, a 60-year-old worker at Demingwang Flour Store, said, "In 1932, the boss formally let me hold two and a half tenths of a body share, and I felt that I had a stake in the business. However, all these years of labor have been exploited by the capitalists." If workers were unwilling to hold shares, capitalists would use coercive methods. For example, old worker Chen Guo of Yongfeng Flour Mill was not allowed to continue working if he refused to hold shares. Money shares were generally acquired when capitalists delayed workers' wages and deceived workers into buying shares when settling accounts and distributing dividends at the end of the year. Zhang An and others at Deqingheng Flour Mill were forced to buy money shares in this way. Some capitalists forced workers to buy shares when they joined the factory; those who did not buy shares were not allowed to work. Yixingchang Flour Store required workers hired in 1950 to contribute a bolt of cloth as a share to be employed. After being deceived and coerced into holding body shares and money shares, workers would fulfill the regulations of the signed "Ten Thousand Gold Treasure Ledger." The "Ten Thousand Gold Treasure Ledger" was actually an iron chain placed around the workers' necks, making those holding shares work for the capitalists until death. After workers were listed on the "Ten Thousand Gold Treasure Ledger," they had to: (1) Reduce wages: Workers holding shares had their wages reduced by half or even more. Wang Jingxian of Demingwang Flour Store earned only 45 jin of oat flour per month in 1944, while ordinary workers earned at least 120 jin. (2) Suffer servitude: Holding shares meant being the capitalist's slave, serving him docilely, even working as a night watchman, guarding the courtyard, and serving the inner boss. Hu Shangbao, a 60-year-old worker at Shixingkui Flour Store, accused at the meeting: "Every year when the boss's child was sick, he would ask me to go to Cier Mountain to pray to the 'Goddess,' and when his wife gave birth, he wanted me to invite the midwife. I became his old 'Xue Bao'!" (Old 'Xue Bao' is the loyal servant in the Peking opera 'San Niang Teaches Her Son'!)
    (3) Blur class consciousness: After workers held shares, the capitalists conspired to use the name of "owners" to prevent workers from seeing the evils of the capitalists. After liberation, they were forced to help the capitalists engage in malpractices. Capitalists took advantage of the workers' "shareholding" to fabricate false accounts, evade taxes, underreport capital to deceive the government, use large amounts of funds for empty transactions, conceal enemy and puppet materials and off-book assets, and engage in various illegal activities. After the capitalists of Deqingheng Flour Mill dragged Zhang An and other three old shop assistants and accountant Wang Ruixu into their schemes, they engaged in empty transactions on a large scale during price fluctuations in 1949 and also concealed over 400 million yuan worth of enemy and puppet materials. (4) Extend working hours: Those holding body shares had to work for the capitalists at all times, day and night, month after month. Because the "Ten Thousand Gold Treasure Ledger" stated clearly when holding shares, "Your body belongs to the shop," of course, if you are not there, you are nothing. The capitalists seized on this point and used the workers like beasts of burden. Zhang An, a worker at Deqingheng Flour Mill, painfully said, "I never knew what a Sunday was!" However, when the factory made money, the capitalists only told the workers a small part of the profits, while secretly pocketing the majority in the "hidden accounts." Deqingheng Flour Mill had a net profit of 30 million yuan in 1949, but the capitalists only wrote 12 million yuan on the official books. The capitalists pocketed 18 million yuan. Moreover, even if the workers holding shares endured these harsh conditions, they could not be considered to have secured their shares. Holding shares also required first "inserting a strip," inserting it for one year, two years, or three years, until the capitalist considered it acceptable before it was considered a formal share; otherwise, if it was pulled out, there would be nothing left. Wang Jixian, Shi Junshan, Zhao Zhanying, and Yan Zizhong of Yongfeng Flour Mill are still "strip shares." The 60-year-old worker at Demingwang Flour Store had his "strip" inserted for three years and still had not obtained a formal share. What if you got a formal share? Would the meat and soup be rich too? In fact, holding shares earned less than being a worker. Old worker Wang Yu, who held shares, earned 6,000 jin less oat flour than ordinary workers in the four years from 1944 to 1948.
    After the anti-embezzlement movement was launched, the capitalists did not relax their control over the shareholding workers, but intensified their deception, fooling, and ruling of the "shareholding" workers. The capitalists knew that the shareholding workers understood the truth and details of all their illegal activities. Therefore, the capitalists used inducements and threats, talked about face, tried to build relationships, sent money, and sent clothes, and even threatened them by saying, "You were the ones who handled all the illegal matters," in order to suppress workers' reporting and cover up illegal acts.
    However, under the direct leadership and education of the Communist Party and the trade union, the workers' awareness rapidly increased. The reality of the anti-embezzlement struggle further made the shareholding workers realize the capitalists' vicious means of using shareholding to divide the working class and cruelly exploit workers. They put forward the slogan "Perform meritorious service in the movement, and gloriously return to the ranks of the working class" and exposed all the capitalists' evils. The Deqingheng Flour Mill alone was reported to have evaded taxes, concealed enemy property, and other illegal activities totaling over 900 million yuan.
    The workers who had been deceived into holding shares felt particularly happy after crossing out their names on the capitalists' "Ten Thousand Gold Treasure Ledger." They said, "We have truly returned to our ranks!"
    Now, the workers who have withdrawn their "body shares" and "property shares" are settling accounts in detail with the bosses.

    退出“身股”“财股”，再不上当了
    ——记张家口市面粉业工人退股大会
    汪圻  李孝诚
    二月二十六日，张家口市面粉业工会第一、二、三、四、五、七分会和永丰面粉厂基层工会的全体职工四百余人，开了一个工人退股大会。德明旺、世兴魁、永丰等二十个面粉厂的经理，亲自捧着从不轻易拿出来的“万金宝账”，听候工人的正义控诉。二十多个工人代表控诉了资本家拉骗工人入股，残酷剥削工人，模糊工人的阶级意识，分化工人阶级团结等罪行以后，五十四个有“身股”或“财股”的工人，亲手用蘸满浓墨的毛笔，当场在资本家捧着“万金宝账”上勾掉了自己的名字，回到工人阶级的本队来。
    工人代表们在大会上揭发了资本家拉骗工人顶股的阴险毒辣手段。
    张家口市私营面粉业共有职工三百七十八人，其中有五十四人顶了人股或财股。顶股一般是在“专东”和“合东”制的商店发生的，所谓“专东”就是一个东家出资金，聘用经理，三年分一次红，如德明旺面行。“合东”是几个东家出资金，兼任经理、副经理，每一年分一次红，如德庆恒面庄。
    “顶股”分为顶钱股和身股两种。资本家让工人顶身股，主要是要叫工人做他的忠实奴才，任劳任怨地为他效劳。一般方法是“名利双诱”。资本家说：“顶了身股，店员也就成了东家了，生意发了财你们也沾光。”德明旺面行六十岁的老工人王棫说：“一九三二年掌柜的把我正式顶了二厘五的身股，我觉得这买卖可就有咱的一份了。可是，这些年的劳动都被资本家剥削去了。”工人如不愿顶股，资本家就采用强迫办法。如永丰面粉厂老工人陈果不愿顶股，资本家就不许他继续工作。所谓钱股，一般是资本家拖欠工人的工资，在年终算账分红时欺骗工人入股。德庆恒面庄张安等都是被资本家用这种办法强迫入了钱股。也有的资本家在工人入工厂时强迫入股，不入股就不许工作。义兴昌面行在一九五○年雇用的工人必须拿一匹布入股才能工作。工人被欺骗、胁迫顶了身股、钱股后，就履行签订的“万金宝账”的规定。“万金宝账”实际上是给工人套上的一条铁锁链，使顶股的工人为资本家效劳到死。工人上了“万金宝账”之后，就要：（一）减低工资：凡顶了股的工人都要被减低工资二分之一甚至更多。德明旺面行的王敬贤在一九四四年每月只挣四十五斤莜面，但一般工人最少挣一百二十斤。（二）受奴役：顶了股，就是资本家的奴隶，得服服贴贴地给他做活，甚至打更、看院、伺候内掌柜的。世兴魁面庄的六十岁的老工人胡尚宝在大会上控诉说：“每年掌柜的孩子病了，就叫我上赐儿山求‘娘娘’，生孩子要我去请老娘婆，我成了他家的老‘薛保’（老‘薛保’是‘三娘教子’京剧中的忠实奴仆）！”
    （三）模糊了阶级意识：工人顶了股以后，资本家就阴谋以都是“东家”为名，使工人看不到资方的罪恶。在解放之后，就被迫帮助资方捣鬼。资本家利用工人“顶股”之便，大肆造假账，偷税，少报资金欺骗政府，用大量资金做空头买卖，隐匿敌伪物资和账外财产，进行各种违法活动。德庆恒面庄的资本家把张安等三个老店员和会计王瑞雨拉下水后，就在一九四九年物价波动时大做空头买卖，还隐匿敌伪物资四亿多元。（四）延长工时：凡顶身股后就得成年成月每时每刻地为资本家工作。因为顶股时“万金宝账”说得明白：“身在号顶股”，当然如果不在就没有了。资本家就抓住了这点，把工人当牛马使用。德庆恒面庄的工人张安痛心地说：“我从来不知道什么是星期日！”可是，厂里赚了钱，资本家只告诉工人盈余的一小部，而在“暗账”上独吞盈余的大部。德庆恒面庄在一九四九年共盈纯利三千万元，资本家在明账上写一千二百万元。一千八百万元被资本家独吞了。而且，顶股的工人就是忍受了上面这些苛刻的条件，也不能算顶稳了股子。顶股还得先“夹条”，夹上一年、两年、三年，直到资本家认为可以了才算顶上正股；否则往外一抽，什么都没有了。永丰面粉厂的王继贤、时俊山、赵占瀛、阎子中四人，至今还都是“夹条股”。德明旺面行六十岁的老工人就夹了三年“条”还没顶上正股。顶了正股又怎样呢？肉肥汤也肥吗？事实上顶股还不如当工人挣得多。顶股的老工人王棫从一九四四年到一九四八年四年中，就比普通工人少挣六千斤莜面。
    反盗窃运动开展后，资本家并没有放松对顶股工人的统治，而且变本加厉地欺骗、愚弄、统治“顶股”的工人。资本家的一切违法行为的真象和底细，顶股的工人都了解，于是，资方利诱威胁并施，讲面子，套交情，送钞票，送衣服，更以“违法事都是你们经手搞的”相威胁，以图达到压制工人检举和掩饰违法行为的目的。
    但在共产党和工会的直接领导和教育下，职工的觉悟迅速提高，反盗窃斗争的现实教育，更使顶股的工人认清了资本家利用顶股来分化工人阶级，残酷剥削工人的狠毒手段。他们提出了“在运动中立功，光荣地回到工人阶级队伍里”的口号，把资本家一切罪恶都揭发出来。仅德庆恒面庄资方就被检举出偷税、隐匿敌产等共九亿元以上。
    被欺骗而顶股的工人在资本家的“万金宝账”上勾掉了自己的名字以后，都感到特别愉快，他们说：“我们真正回到我们的队伍里来了！”
    现在，退出“身股”、“财股”的工人，正和老板们详细算账。
