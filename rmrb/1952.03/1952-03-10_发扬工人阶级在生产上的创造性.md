Promote the Creativity of the Working Class in Production

Kunming Yunmao Yarn Factory Worker Ding Kejing Successfully Manufactures Leather Rollers Using Local Sheepskin

    In the past, the Kunming Private Yunmao Yarn Factory used imported sheepskin to manufacture leather rollers. After liberation, Ding Kejing, a worker at the factory who made leather rollers, based on his 27 years of rich experience in manufacturing leather rollers, thought, "If foreign goods can be used to make leather rollers, why can't Chinese goods be used to make leather rollers?" So he began research and experimentation. However, at the time, some engineers with conservative ideas expressed doubt, saying: They had never heard of using local sheepskin to make leather rollers. Later, with the support of the trade union, Ding Kejing insisted on experimenting and finally succeeded. The leather rollers made of Yunnan sheepskin have a lifespan more than twice as long as foreign leather rollers and have higher production efficiency. If this factory fully adopts local sheepskin leather rollers, it can increase production by 360 pieces of yarn a year, and also save 600 US dollars in foreign exchange by purchasing 180 foreign sheepskins.

    Yunnan has a lot of local sheepskin. If tanneries improve their specifications in the future, the sheepskin produced in Yunnan will be enough for yarn factories across the country to manufacture leather rollers.

Xinhua News Agency: Southwest No. 152 Factory Produces a Large Number of Pneumatic Drills for Coal Mining

    The No. 152 Factory, under the Industrial Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, has begun to produce pneumatic drills in large quantities. Pneumatic drills are very important coal mining machinery, which used to rely on imports from abroad. The manufacture of pneumatic drills first requires special alloy steel as raw material, and secondly, high-level steel heat treatment technology and excellent equipment. After accepting the glorious task of trial-producing pneumatic drills in 1950, the workers of Factory No. 152, through a year of hard work, successfully trial-produced them in June 1951. After use by coal miners, they believed that the performance was very good. Therefore, the Central Fuel Industry Department ordered three times more pneumatic drills from Factory No. 152 than in 1951. At present, Factory No. 152 has begun to produce pneumatic drills in large quantities to meet the needs of coal mining industrial mechanization.

    发扬工人阶级在生产上的创造性
    昆明云茂纱厂工人丁可敬用土产羊皮制造皮辊成功
    昆明私营云茂纱厂过去制造皮辊所用的羊皮都是从外国输入的。解放后这个厂的制作皮辊的工人丁可敬根据他二十七年制造皮辊的丰富经验想到：“同样是羊皮，外国货可以做皮辊，为什么中国货不能做皮辊呢？”他就开始研究试验。但是当时有些带有保守思想的工程师表示怀疑说：从来就没有听说过用土羊皮制皮辊，之后，在工会的支持下，丁可敬仍坚持试验，终于成功。用云南羊皮作成的皮辊比外国皮皮辊的寿命长一倍多，并且生产效率更高。如果这个厂完全采用土羊皮皮辊，一年可以增产三百六十件纱，还可以节省购买一百八十张外国羊皮的外汇六百元美金。
    云南土产羊皮很多，今后制革厂如改进规格，云南所产羊皮足够供全国纱厂制造皮辊之用。
    西南一五二工厂大量生产采煤用的风镐
    西南军政委员会工业部所属一五二工厂已开始大量生产风镐。风镐是非常重要的采煤机械，过去一向依赖从国外输入。制造风镐首先需要特殊合金钢作原料，其次要有高度的钢铁热处理的技术和优良设备。一五二工厂工人自一九五零年接受了试制风镐的光荣任务后，经过一年的努力，已在一九五一年六月试制成功。煤矿工人使用后，认为效能很好。因此中央燃料工业部向一五二工厂订购了三倍于一九五一年定货的风镐。目前一五二工厂已开始大量生产风镐，以满足采煤工业机械化的需要。  （新华社）
