The World Federation of Trade Unions Asian-Australasian Liaison Bureau Sends Telegram to Japan National Relief Society
In Support of the Struggle of Innocent Defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident"
Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: The Asian-Australasian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram on the 13th to Tatsuji Fuse, Chairman of the Japan National Relief Society, expressing respect and support for the just struggle waged by the Society to rescue the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." At the same time, the Asian-Australasian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions also sent separate telegrams again to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida and the Chief Judge of the Sendai High Court, protesting the persecution of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" and demanding their immediate release.

The text of the telegram to Tatsuji Fuse is as follows:

"The announcement of a retrial in the 'Matsukawa Incident,' a preliminary victory in the Japanese people's struggle against conspiracy and persecution and for the protection of human rights, is directly related to the remarkable achievements of the work of the Japan National Relief Society under your leadership.

The people of the world warmly praise and support your series of activities in maintaining justice and human rights in extremely difficult circumstances! The Asian-Australasian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of millions of workers in Asia and Australia, extends its sincere respect to you!

The recent series of incidents in Japan involving provocation and entrapment of progressive organizations fully demonstrate that the Japanese people must be more vigilant and continue to fight against the conspiracies of the reactionaries.

We have once again protested to Prime Minister Yoshida and the Chief Judge of the Sendai High Court, demanding the immediate release of all innocent defendants in the 'Matsukawa Incident,' and calling on workers in Asian and Australian countries to continue to support your just struggle. We wish you new and greater victories!"

The text of the second protest telegram to Shigeru Yoshida is as follows:

"The Sendai High Court of Japan was forced to announce a retrial of the 'Matsukawa Incident' due to the complete failure of the accusations against the innocent defendants.

The trials from the Fukushima District Court to the Sendai High Court have undoubtedly shown that the testimonies of witnesses presented by the trial authorities are completely lies, the physical evidence is completely fabricated, and the so-called criminal acts of the defendants are nothing but entrapment. The conspiracy of the reactionaries has been nakedly exposed and is known to all. The protests of hundreds of millions of people around the world and the heroic struggle of the Japanese people have dealt a serious blow to the conspiracy to manufacture provocative incidents in order to persecute freedom-loving people in Japan and destroy progressive organizations in Japan. The tactic of renaming the "Matsukawa Incident" as the "Northeast District Train Derailment Incident" cannot in the slightest degree divert the anger of the people of the world towards this conspiracy.

The Asian-Australasian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of millions of workers in Asia and Australia, demands the immediate release of all innocent defendants and an end to their persecution."

The text of the second protest telegram to the Chief Judge of the Sendai High Court is as follows:

"The conspiracy of entrapment in the 'Matsukawa Incident' has been thoroughly exposed during the trial, thus forcing you to announce a retrial of the case. Human justice demands that you immediately declare the twenty defendants innocent and restore their freedom. The Asian-Australasian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of millions of workers in Asia and Australia, protests against any continued persecution of innocent people. In addition to once again protesting to Prime Minister Yoshida, we once again demand that you immediately stop the so-called retrial and promptly release all innocent defendants."

    世界工联亚澳联络局致电日本国民救援会
    声援“松川事件”无辜被告的斗争
    【新华社十三日讯】世界工会联合会亚澳联络局在十三日致电日本国民救援会主席布施辰治，对该会为救援“松川事件”无辜被告而进行的正义斗争表示敬意和支援。世界工联亚澳联络局同时并分别再度致电日本首相吉田茂和仙台高等裁判所裁判长，抗议对“松川事件”无辜被告的迫害，并要求立即释放他们。
    致布施辰治的电文如下：
    “‘松川事件’被宣布重审，日本人民这一反对阴谋迫害、保障人权的斗争的初步胜利，是和您所领导的日本国民救援会的工作的显著成绩直接相关连的。
    全世界人民都热烈称赞和拥护你们在极端艰苦环境下为维护正义与人权所进行的一系列活动！世界工联亚澳联络局代表亚洲澳洲千百万工人谨向你们致以诚挚的敬意！
    从最近日本所发生的一系列的挑衅和陷害进步组织的事件，充分说明了日本人民必须倍加警惕，再接再厉地和反动派的阴谋进行斗争。
    我们已再次向吉田首相、仙台高等裁判所裁判长提出抗议，要求立即释放‘松川事件’全体无辜被告，并号召亚澳各国工人继续支援你们的正义斗争。祝你们获得新的更大的胜利！”
    致吉田茂的二次抗议电电文如下：
    “日本仙台高等裁判所由于向‘松川事件’无辜被告所提控诉的完全破产，因而被迫宣布该案重新审判了。
    从福岛地方裁判所到仙台高等裁判所的审判，都无可置疑地表明了审判当局所提人证的口供完全是扯谎，物证完全是伪造的，所谓被告者的犯罪行为只不过是陷害。反动者的阴谋已赤裸裸地被揭发出来而为人所共知了。全世界亿万人的纷纷抗议，日本人民的英勇斗争，给予那种制造挑衅事件以图迫害日本爱好自由的人民、摧毁日本进步组织的阴谋以严重的打击。将“松川事件”改名为“东北地区列车颠覆事件”的手法，也丝毫不能转移全世界人民对这一阴谋的愤怒。
    世界工联亚澳联络局代表亚洲澳洲千百万工人，要求立即释放全体无辜被告，并终止对他们的迫害。”
    致日本仙台高等裁判所裁判长的二次抗议电电文如下：
    “‘松川事件’的陷害阴谋已在审判过程中被彻底揭穿，因而迫使你们宣布了这一案件的重审。人类的正义要求你们立即宣布二十名被告无罪，并恢复他们的自由。世界工联亚澳联络局代表亚洲澳洲千百万工人，抗议对无辜者继续进行任何迫害。我们除再一次向吉田首相提出抗议外，再次要求你立即停止所谓重审，迅速释放全体无辜被告者。”
