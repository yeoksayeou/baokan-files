    Joyful Meeting
    Xia Guang, Representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Home

    It was a morning with drizzling rain. Upstairs in the Wumin Elementary School on Nanshan Road, Hangzhou, in the guest room of Glorious Mother Deng Shaonai, twelve family members of Volunteer Army soldiers from Hangzhou gathered. With incomparable joy and fervent hearts, they met with us, the representatives of the Volunteer Army returning home.

    The hostess of this glorious home—Deng Shaonai—is the mother of eleven children. Dressed in brand new clothes, she bustled about, busily attending to everything. A working comrade from the Municipal People's Government introduced her to everyone, saying, "This glorious mother has dedicated all eleven of her children to the country, and two of them are fighting the American devils in Korea and have even been recognized for their meritorious service." As soon as these words were spoken, everyone present focused their gaze on this glorious mother, expressing their boundless respect for her.

    On the white walls of this glorious home hung an exquisite frame, enclosing two Merit Citation certificates. These were the awards given to Deng Shaonai's third son, Comrade Tang Di, for his meritorious service in the Hamgyongnam-do campaign and the Fifth Campaign in Korea. Everyone stared at them intently. At this moment, Mr. Luo Baokui from No. 10 Xiaomiao Alley was also busy taking out his son Luo Jinhai's Merit Citation and letters from Korea from his cotton-padded pocket, presenting them one by one to Regiment Commander Li Xuesan. Seeing these countless heroic deeds, everyone in the room smiled broadly.

    Amid the joyous laughter, Regiment Commander Li Xuesan said warmly, "Today, we represent your children to visit and express our regards to you." The twelve glorious fathers and mothers tightly grasped the hands of the representatives, shedding tears of excitement.

    The glorious fathers and mothers were most concerned about the situation of their children fighting on the front lines, as well as all the details of their lives. Deng Shaonai and Old Mrs. Gao embraced the female representative, Comrade Zhang Chao, examining her carefully. Patting her back, they said, "Are you from Korea? Ah, your complexion is so good, so robust, I am truly relieved!" Comrade Zhang Chao said, "Thanks to the strong support of the people of the motherland, the situation at the front is much better than before."

    As Regiment Commander Li Xuesan introduced the news of victories from the front lines, his words were interrupted several times by the applause of the military families.

    Regiment Commander Li Xuesan held up a bright red flower, and said excitedly, "The people of the whole country call our Volunteer Army the most beloved people, and you are the parents of the most beloved people, you are the most glorious people. I would like to offer the flowers presented to us by the people of Hangzhou to our dear parents. I wish you all good health and everlasting glory!" Bunches of flowers, symbolizing happiness and joy, were presented to the glorious fathers and mothers.

    The Volunteer Army family members told the representatives about the warm situation in which the people of the motherland support the army and give preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers; under the care of the People's Government and the broad masses of the people, the families of Volunteer Army soldiers have all participated in production in an organized manner, and the lives of the families of martyrs and soldiers are getting better day by day. The Xiachheng District People's Government once allocated 100 million yuan to the families of martyrs and soldiers as production funds and opened a production welfare society, which set up a sack processing factory, a sewing department, a general merchandise department, etc., which solved the employment problems of many military families. In January of this year, a coal briquette factory, a hemp rope factory and a tofu workshop were newly established in the society, making the lives of the families of martyrs and soldiers in Xiachheng District gradually more fulfilling. Speaking of this, Mr. Luo Baokui, a member of a military family, spoke vividly about his own family affairs. His family had four members, and their life was originally very poor; since the district established the military family production welfare society, the government introduced his eldest son to work in the local products company, and also introduced his nineteen-year-old daughter to work in the hemp spinning factory. The two have a monthly salary income of 130 units. In this way, the problems of food, clothing, etc. for the whole family were solved. Although Old Mrs. Luo is sixty-two years old, her enthusiasm for production is very high. Sometimes she also goes to the sack factory to do a short-term job, sewing some sacks, and can earn four to five thousand yuan a day. Speaking of this, Mr. Luo Baokui waved his hand and said, "I really never dreamed of having such a life now."

    The mother of Comrade Hong Jinbao, a car driver in a certain unit on the Korean front, rushed to tell everyone: Her eldest son was also introduced by the military family production welfare society to work at the China Salt Industry Corporation. Because of his active work, he now earns a salary of eighty units per month. During the Spring Festival this year, the whole family made new clothes. The words of the military family members moved the representatives, and smiles of excitement appeared on the face of each representative.

    The military family members talked even more excitedly about the improvement of their political status. During every festival, personnel from the government and people's organizations come to visit, give gifts, and hang glorious lanterns. Around the Spring Festival, nearly 20,000 children in Hangzhou, with respectful hearts, launched a campaign to do something for the families of martyrs and soldiers, which greatly encouraged and comforted the families of martyrs and soldiers spiritually. The students of Hangzhou Girls' Middle School of Zhejiang Province diligently helped Old Mrs. Wu Jingui, No. 3 Wenxing Alley, Xiachheng District, with her work. The students enthusiastically told her: "Your eldest brother is fighting the American devils on the front line, and all around you are your children. If you have any difficulties, please let us know and we will help you solve them." The children of the new China are using such ardent hearts to love the families of the Volunteer Army's martyrs and soldiers. Speaking of these things, the twelve military family members all praised in unison: "The children taught by Chairman Mao are all good!"

    When Regiment Commander Li Xuesan inquired about the schooling and healthcare of the children of military families, Han Baozhen, a member of a military family from No. 112 Qingtai Street, Zhongcheng District, said:

    "Last year, I suffered from amoebic dysentery, and I was very ill. When the district government found out, they immediately sent me to Hangzhou Infectious Disease Hospital to cure the disease." Mrs. Zhu Jiangshi, a member of a military family, was ill, and the government subsidized her with 400 kilograms of rice and introduced her to Shanghai Radium Hospital for treatment for more than two months, and she quickly recovered her health. Mentioning the matter of the children of military families going to school, Ge Jinchun, a member of a military family, took out photos of his two sons and said: "They were both introduced by the government to study in the third grade of Qingtai Street Elementary School free of charge."

    While the Volunteer Army soldiers are fighting the American devils on the front line, the glorious fathers and mothers are also actively participating in various work at home. They have warmly responded to the call of the Communist Party and the People's Government and have become the backbone of various movements. Mr. Zhu Zemin excitedly told everyone: "During the anti-theft movement, our military family members in Xiachheng District specially organized a propaganda team to conduct propaganda on the streets and expose the crimes of unscrupulous merchants harming the Volunteer Army." Mr. Zhu Zemin is a brave fighter, and he reported the crimes of nine illegal merchants evading taxes.

    The hearts of the glorious fathers and mothers are strong. In the discussion, they all expressed in unison: It is glorious for our children to fight the American devils on the front line, and we must actively engage in production in the rear to support the front line. When Mr. Zhu Zemin answered Regiment Commander Li Xuesan's question about what words he would like to bring to his children in Korea, he said concisely and forcefully: "We are doing very well, tell them to be more courageous in killing the enemy."

    喜悦的会见
    中国人民志愿军归国代表　夏光
    是一个飘拂着细雨的早晨。杭州市南山路武民小学楼上，光荣妈妈邓少奶的客屋里，聚集着杭州市十二位志愿军家属。他们怀着无比喜悦和热烈的心情，会见了我们志愿军归国代表们。
    这个光荣之家的女主人——邓少奶，是十一个孩子的母亲。她穿着簇新的衣服，忙碌地张罗着，市人民政府的工作同志向大家介绍说：“这位光荣妈妈把所有的十一个孩子都献给祖国了，其中有两个在朝鲜打美国鬼子，还立了功。”话刚说完，在座的每一个人的目光都一致集中到这位光荣妈妈的身上，对她表示了无限的敬意。
    在这光荣之家的洁白的墙壁上，挂着一付精美的镜框，里面夹着两张立功喜报，这是邓少奶的三儿子唐棣同志在朝鲜咸镜南道战役和第五次战役中获得的立功奖状。大家目不转睛地望着它。这时，小庙巷十号的罗宝奎老先生也忙着从棉袍口袋里掏出他儿子罗金海从朝鲜寄来的立功喜报和书信，一件一件地送给李雪三团长看。看到这数不尽的英雄业迹，全屋的每个人都笑逐颜开。
    在欢腾的笑声中，李雪三团长亲切地说：“今天我们代表你们的儿女来拜访和慰问你们。”十二位光荣的父亲和母亲，紧紧地拉住代表们的手，兴奋得流出了热泪。
    光荣爸爸和光荣妈妈们最关心自己的儿女在前线战斗的情形，以及生活中的一切细节。邓少奶和高老太太抱住女代表张潮同志，仔细地端详着她。拍着她的背说：“你是从朝鲜来的吗？啊，脸色这样好，这样壮实，我真放心了！”张潮同志说：“由于祖国人民大力的支援，前方的情形，比过去好多了。”
    当李雪三团长介绍前线胜利消息时，他的话几次被军属们的掌声所打断。
    李雪三团长高举起鲜艳的红花，兴奋地说：“全国人民把我们志愿军称为最可爱的人，你们是最可爱的人的父母，你们是最光荣的人。我谨将杭州市人民献给我们的鲜花再献给我们亲爱的父母们。祝各位身体健康，永远光荣！”象征着幸福和快乐的鲜花，一束束地送到了光荣爸爸和光荣妈妈们的怀抱里。
    志愿军家属纷纷向代表们讲述祖国人民拥护军队和优待烈属军属的热烈情况；志愿军的家属在人民政府和广大人民的照顾下，都有组织地参加了生产，烈属军属的生活一天比一天美好起来了，下城区人民政府曾经拨给烈属军属一亿元作生产资金，开设了一个生产福利社，里面设立了麻袋加工厂、缝纫部、百货部等，解决了许多军属的职业问题。今年一月间，社内又新设了煤球工厂、麻绳厂和豆腐坊，使下城区烈属军属的生活逐渐美满起来。谈到这件事，军属罗宝奎老先生眉飞色舞地说起了他自己的家事。他家有四口人，原来生活是极贫苦的；自从区里成立了军属生产福利社以后，政府介绍他大儿子到土产公司参加了工作，又将他十九岁的女儿介绍到麻纺厂做工。两人每月有一百三十个单位的工资收入。这样全家吃穿等问题都解决了。罗老太太虽然有六十二岁了，但她的生产热情却挺高，有时还到麻袋厂作个短工，缝织些麻袋，每天可挣四五千元。说到这里，罗宝奎先生挥动着手说：“我现在有这样的日子，真是过去做梦也想不到的。”
    在朝鲜前线某部任汽车驾驶员的洪金宝同志的母亲抢着告诉大家：她的大儿子也由军属生产福利社介绍到中国盐业公司做事。由于他工作积极，现在每月可拿八十个单位的工资。今年过年时，全家都做了新衣服。军属们的话，激动了代表们，每个代表的脸都挂上了兴奋的笑容。
    军属们更兴奋地谈到他们政治地位的提高。每逢节日，都有政府和人民团体的人员来访问、送礼和挂光荣灯。春节前后，杭州市将近两万名少年儿童，怀着敬爱的心情展开了给烈属军属们做一件事的运动，使烈属军属在精神上得到极大的鼓励和安慰。浙江省立杭州女中的学生们，辛勤地帮助下城区文星巷三号的吴金桂老大娘做活。同学们热情地告诉她：“大哥哥在前方打美国鬼子，周围都是你的子女，有什么困难提出来，我们帮你解决。”新中国的少年儿童就是用这样火热的心在热爱志愿军的烈属军属。谈到这些事，十二位军属都异口同声地称赞：“毛主席教养出来的孩子都是好样的！”
    当李雪三团长询问到军属子弟的就学和保健问题的时候，中城区清泰街一一二号军属韩宝珍说：
    “去年我患了阿米巴痢疾，病很重，区政府知道了，马上把我送到杭州传染病医院里把病治好了。”军属朱蒋氏有病，政府补助她四百斤大米，介绍她到上海镭锭医院治疗了二个多月，很快恢复了健康。提到军属子弟上学的事，军属葛锦春掏出他两个儿子的照片说：“他们都由政府介绍到清泰街小学三年级免费读书。”
    志愿军战士们在前方打美国鬼子，光荣爸爸和光荣妈妈在家里也积极地参加了各种工作，他们热烈地响应了共产党和人民政府的号召，并成为各种运动中的骨干。朱泽民老先生兴奋地告诉大家：“反盗窃运动中，我们下城区军属专门组织了一个宣传队，到街上进行宣传，揭发了奸商暗害志愿军的罪恶。”朱泽民先生是勇敢的斗士，他检举了九家违法商人偷税漏税的罪行。
    光荣爸爸和光荣妈妈的心是坚强的，在座谈中，他们都同声表示：子弟在前线打美国鬼子是光荣的，我们在后方一定要积极生产来支援前线。朱泽民先生在回答李雪三团长所问的有什么话带给朝鲜的子女的时候，他简明有力地说：“我们很好，要他们更英勇杀敌。”
