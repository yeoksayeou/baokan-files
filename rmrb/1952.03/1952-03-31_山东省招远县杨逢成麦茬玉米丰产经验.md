    Yang Fengcheng, a farmer from Xiaotuan Village, Seventh District, Zhaoyuan County, Shandong Province, planted 1.54 mu of corn intercropped with wheat in 1951 and harvested a total of 1,950 jin, equivalent to 1,266 jin per mu, more than double the average yield of paddy field corn intercropped with wheat by local farmers. Why was Yang Fengcheng's corn intercropped with wheat able to achieve such a high yield?

    First, he paid great attention to cultivating soil fertility. This is the basic condition for achieving a bumper harvest of two crops a year.

    His high-yield land grows two crops a year (one crop of wheat and one crop of corn). The agricultural season in the Jiaodong area of Shandong Province is relatively late. In the Zhaoyuan County area, wheat is not harvested until the summer solstice, which is half a month later than in areas such as Jinan. After harvesting wheat, in order to strive for a bumper harvest of two crops, corn must be sown in a timely manner. There is a saying locally, "Wheat does not allow ? (麦不让?)," and generally, farmers do not plow the land before sowing corn in order to save time, so the soil fertility does not have a chance to recover. In order to overcome this limitation, Yang Fengcheng specially deepened the plowing and applied more fertilizer before planting wheat to cultivate soil fertility. For example, before planting wheat, he would plow to a depth of five or six inches and apply about 8,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. Moreover, his base fertilizer was mainly pig manure, the best type of barnyard manure. During the wheat growing season, he also applied about 1,900 jin of "fenjiang" topdressing fertilizer per mu. "Fenjiang" is a type of fertilizer made by fermenting a mixture of mung bean residue and slurry water. In addition to containing a large amount of nitrogen, it also contains phosphorus. Experiments have shown that the fertilizer effect of 1,900 jin of "fenjiang" is equivalent to 130 jin of soybean cake. He used this method of cultivating soil fertility to resolve the contradiction between the local climate and the crop growing season. In this way, the soil fertility was still very full after the wheat harvest, which was sufficient for the nutrients needed for the growth and development of corn seedlings.

    Second, he improved the variety by using continuous selection.

    Yang Fengcheng understands the principle of "a strong mother produces a strong offspring." He believes that selecting good varieties is an important condition for obtaining a high yield. He also used continuous selection and emasculation hybridization to continuously improve the variety. The corn he grows is a good local variety called "Dali Hong" (Big Grain Red). He has been selecting seeds from the "Dali Hong" variety for more than ten years. Since 1949, he has also responded to the call of the People's Government and has carried out emasculation hybridization selection year after year. His selection method is very prominent: during the corn growing season, he often pays attention to observing healthy and vigorous plants without diseases or pests, and marks them. When the tassels have emerged but have not yet bloomed, he performs emasculation. He used this method to try out a total of fifty corn plants this year. At harvest time, the plants were pulled up together, and then the corn ears growing in the middle of the corn plants, which were long and symmetrical in shape, with plump kernels and neat rows, were selected and placed in a vacant house to dry. Before sowing the following year, the kernels at both ends of the ears were removed, and only the kernels in the middle were selected as seeds. He said: "The kernels in the middle are of a suitable size, and the seedlings emerge evenly after sowing and mature consistently." For more than ten years, he has carefully selected seeds, continuously improving the excellent characteristics of the "Dali Hong" variety, making it a high-yielding variety adapted to the local environment. Now, he believes that the "Dali Hong" variety has the following main advantages: (1) The plants grow vigorously, with stems seven and a half feet tall, suitable for dense planting under superior conditions of abundant manure and water. (2) Excellent quality. "Dali Hong" belongs to the flint corn type, with reddish-yellow kernels, which are extremely popular in the local market. (3) Suitable for growing in the local sandy loam soil and in the climate of spring and summer drought and concentrated rainfall in July and August. (4) Short growing period and early maturity. The entire growing period of "Dali Hong" (from growth to maturity) is only 107 days, suitable for two crops a year (planting corn in wheat stubble fields after harvesting wheat). For example, last year he harvested 450 jin of wheat per mu, and after harvesting wheat, he harvested 1,266 jin of corn, for a total of more than 1,700 jin of grain per year. This shows that among the local varieties, good excellent varieties can be obtained by continuous careful selection every year. His approach broke through the circle of the "pure line theory" and pointed out a new direction for improving varieties.

    Third, he accepted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and planted appropriately densely.

    Local farmers generally plant about 2,500 "Dali Hong" corn plants per mu. Yang Fengcheng planted 3,330 plants per mu, 830 more plants per mu than ordinary farmers. According to his experience, under the conditions of abundant manure and water, the chance of one corn plant producing two ears in the same unit area is only one in ten. That is to say, only one out of every ten plants will produce two ears. But if two plants are planted, it is certain that each plant will produce one ear, so the two plants will at least produce two ears. He specifically applied the Soviet Union's advanced experience on dense planting, which is also an important reason for obtaining a high yield.

    Fourth, he created a reasonable fertilization method based on climate characteristics, fertilizer properties, and corn growth and development.

    Corn is a crop with strong fertilizer tolerance. To obtain a high yield, it is necessary to apply a lot of fertilizer. About ten days after corn sowing, when the seedlings are one and a half inches tall, about 2,300 jin of "fenjiang" topdressing fertilizer should be applied per mu. Its fertilizer effect is equivalent to about 160 jin of soybean cake. His fertilization method is to dig pits between the plants with a hoe, put the manure in the pits, and then cover it with soil (because "fenjiang" is a semi-liquid fertilizer, this prevents it from spreading). He applied the topdressing fertilizer in one concentrated application. On the surface, it seems that he did not accept the principle of applying fertilizer in stages; in fact, he did this in combination with specific circumstances, which still conformed to the spirit of applying fertilizer in stages. Because the "fenjiang" fertilizer he used is a slow-acting fertilizer that decomposes very slowly. The "Dali Hong" variety he planted has a growing period of only about 100 days. If the fertilizer is applied in stages, the fertilizer applied in the later stages will not be effective. Moreover, the "fenjiang" fertilizer he applies needs to be applied in pits. If it is not applied once in the early seedling stage, but is applied in stages when the seedlings are tall, it is easy to damage the corn roots and stems and leaves when digging holes. Local rainfall is concentrated in July and August, and the corn growing season is dry and rainless in the early stages. He applied sufficient base fertilizer once in the early stages, which could not only supply the roots with absorption but also avoid the risk of loss. At the same time, the fertilizer decomposes slowly after application, which can just meet the urgent need for fertilizer after corn tasseling and flowering.

    Fifth, he used the method of controlling watering to promote corn growth and exert fertilizer efficiency.

    The corn land he planted is irrigated land. He grasped two basic principles for watering: first, he used water to control the growth and development of corn; second, he cooperated with the application of fertilizer and used watering to exert the effect of fertilizer in a timely manner. The local corn sowing season is a dry season with little rain. According to his experience, it is necessary to water a small amount once a day after sowing to facilitate seed germination. If there is a lot of rain, watering is not necessary. During the corn seedling stage, watering is not recommended, as long as the seedlings are not allowed to die from drought. This can not only control the growth of corn and prevent it from growing too vigorously but also make the seedlings strong and deeply rooted, so as to cultivate the potential for growth in the later stages. This situation is called "tailihong (胎里宏)" by the local masses. When the corn grows and the plants grow to three feet tall, continuous watering is required. This is the most urgent period for corn to need water and fertilizer. Watering can supply the corn with the water it needs and make the stems and leaves grow rapidly; and it can make the fertilizer exert its effect. Because his corn land is sandy loam, with poor water retention, and the local climate is hot and windy at this time, the evaporation effect is very large, so he generally takes the method of thorough watering. Watering is stopped only until the corn grain filling stage.

    Sixth, he paid attention to improving the technology of cultivating, weeding, and hilling up soil, providing good conditions for corn growth.

    He has a good set of techniques for weeding. At different stages, he uses different depths of cultivation to implement the functions of weeding, conserving moisture, and promoting root development. Seven days after sowing, after the seedlings emerge, the first shallow cultivation (about one and a half inches deep) is carried out. The purpose of this cultivation is mainly to remove weeds and loosen the surface soil, reduce water evaporation, and make the seedlings develop well. After topdressing, when the seedlings are four inches tall, the second cultivation is carried out. This time, deep cultivation is necessary. Because the seedlings only have temporary roots at this time, it is not easy to injure them during cultivation. Deep cultivation not only makes it easy for weeds to die and not germinate again but also loosens the soil, helping the permanent roots of the corn to root deeply and making the seedlings develop healthily. When the seedlings grow to three feet tall, the third cultivation is carried out. At this time, the root development is complete, and deep cultivation is not recommended. Because deep cultivation easily damages the roots, the shallower the cultivation, the better, and the hoe should be farther away from the roots, and scratching the surface of the soil is sufficient to achieve the purpose of weeding and conserving moisture. When cultivating for the third time, attention should be paid to hilling up the soil between the rows to the roots. Because the wind is very strong at this time of the year, this hilling up can make the corn resistant to wind, and it can also bury the weeds. Later, the corn grows very vigorously, weeds are not easy to grow, and the stems and leaves are dense, so there is no need to cultivate again.

    From the above characteristics, it can be seen that Yang Fengcheng's high-yield corn intercropped with wheat was not accidental. The main reason for the high yield is that he mastered the laws of the natural environment and corn growth, and comprehensively improved the technology, so that each yield-increasing factor played its due role. For example, the local climate season is relatively late, with two crops a year, and the soil fertility does not have time to rest. He used the method of applying more fertilizer in the previous crop to cultivate soil fertility to solve the contradiction between the natural season and the crop growing season. With good soil fertility, coupled with the selection of good varieties and dense planting, the yield-increasing effect was exerted. For example, corn needs to be slightly dry in the seedling stage and needs a large amount of water in the later stage, and the local climate is mostly dry in early summer. He mastered these natural laws, so he applied fertilizer early and watered later, so that fertilizer and water were fully coordinated. His technology is very scientific. Why was he able to master this series of farming techniques that conform to scientific principles? This is inseparable from his political consciousness. He was a hired worker in the old society and suffered from the oppression of the landlord class. He was allocated land during the land reform, so his enthusiasm for production was particularly high. During the land reform in 1947, many farmers did not understand the policies, and there was a phenomenon of eating and drinking and wasting the fruits of victory. At this time, Yang Fengcheng was more conscious and focused on production. After he was allocated land, he worked hard and frugally and invested all his strength in production. He and Wang Jingbin from the same village jointly cultivated three mu of land for Wang Yongming, a military family member, and he always advocated giving priority to timely cultivation for the military family member. He always responded to the call of the People's Government as soon as possible. For example, when the government called for seed selection in 1948, he was the first to implement it. He studied technology from many aspects and created the highest record of corn yield in Shandong. In addition, he also engaged in sideline occupations to support agricultural production. The local area mostly uses making vermicelli as a sideline occupation. In addition to making vermicelli, he also made tofu, increasing income to expand reproduction, and used tofu residue to feed pigs and "fenjiang" to make fertilizer. His abundant fertilizer is also an important reason why he was able to achieve a high yield.

    山东省招远县杨逢成麦茬玉米丰产经验
    中央人民政府农业部粮食生产司
    山东省招远县七区小疃村农民杨逢成，一九五一年种了一亩五分四厘麦茬玉米，共计收获一千九百五十斤，折合每亩收一千二百六十六斤，超过当地农民水田麦茬玉米一般产量的一倍多。杨逢成的麦茬玉米为什么能得到丰产呢？
    第一、他非常注意培育地力。这是争取一年
    两季作物丰收的基本条件。
    他的丰产地是一年种二季作物（一季小麦，一季玉米）。山东省胶东地区的农事季节较晚，在招远县一带，每年要到夏至节才收小麦，较济南等地区要晚收半个月。收小麦以后，为了争取两季作物丰收，就要及时播种玉米。当地有“麦不让?”的说法，一般农民为了赶时间，在播种玉米前是不耕地的，因此地力便没有恢复的机会。杨逢成为了克服这种限制，就在种麦前特别加深耕翻地和多施肥料来培养地力。如他在播种小麦前要深耕至五、六寸，每亩施基肥约八千斤，而且他的基肥主要是质地最好的一种厩肥——猪粪。在小麦生长期间，他在每亩地里又施粉浆追肥约一千九百斤。粉浆是一种由绿豆渣和浆水混合起来腐熟而成的肥料，除含多量氮质外，还含有磷质。实验证明一千九百斤粉浆的肥效可抵一百三十斤豆饼。他用这种培养地力的办法，解决了当地气候和作物生长季节间的矛盾。这样到收麦后地力仍很饱满，足够玉米幼苗期生长发育所需的养料。
    第二、他采用连续选种办法，改良了品种。
    杨逢成懂得“母大子壮”的道理。他认为选用良种是获得丰产的重要条件。他并且采用连续选种和去雄杂交的办法，使品种不断改进。他种的玉米是当地一种名“大粒红”的优良品种。他在“大粒红”品种中进行选种已有十多年了。自一九四九年起，他又响应人民政府号召，连年进行去雄杂交选种。他的选种办法是很突出的：在玉米生长期间，就经常注意观察生长健壮没有病虫害的优良植株，并作上记号；到雄穗已经抽出还没有开花时，就进行去雄。他用这办法今年共试了五十株玉米。到收割时连株拔下，再选择生长在玉米植株中部的、形状长大匀称、籽粒饱满、行列整齐的玉米果穗，放在闲屋中风干。到来年播种前，再把果穗除去两端的籽粒，只选用中部的籽粒做种籽。他说：“中部的籽粒，大小相称，播种后出苗整齐，成熟一致。”他十几年来精细选种，不断提高了“大粒红”品种的优良特性，使“大粒红”    品种成为适应当地环境的丰产品种。现在，他认为“大粒红”品种有下列几个主要优点：（一）植株生长健壮，茎高七尺半，在粪大水足的优越条件下，适于密植。（二）品质优良。“大粒红”属硬粒种，籽粒呈红黄色，极受当地市场欢迎。（三）适宜在当地沙质壤土和春夏干旱、七八月雨量集中的气候环境下生长。
    （四）生长期短，成熟早。“大粒红”全生育期
    （从生长到成熟）仅一百零七天，适合一年二作
    （收麦后在麦茬地种玉米）。如他去年种小麦每亩收四百五十斤，收麦后种玉米又收一千二百六十六斤，一年共收粮食一千七百多斤。这说明在当地已有品种中，每年连续精选，就可以得出好的优良品种。他的做法突破了“纯系学说”的圈子，指出了改良品种的新方向。
    第三、他接受苏联先进经验，适当密植。
    当地农民种“大粒红”玉米一般每亩约种二千五百株；杨逢成每亩种到三千三百三十株，比一般农民每亩多种八百三十株。根据他的经验，在粪大水足的情况下，同样单位面积播种一株玉米长双穗的机会只有十分之一。就是说：每十株才能有一株长双穗。但是假若种两株，可以肯定每株必长一穗，这样两株至少可长两个穗。他具体地应用了苏联关于密植的先进经验，也是获得丰产的重要原因。
    第四、他根据气候特点，肥料性质和玉米生
    长发育情况，创造了合理施肥的办法。
    玉米是个耐肥力较强的作物，要获得高额产量，必须多多施肥。在玉米播种后十天左右，苗高一寸半时，每亩应施粉浆追肥约二千三百斤。它的肥效约合豆饼一百六十斤。他施肥的方法是用镢头在株间掘坑，把粪放到坑里，再在上面盖上土（因为粉浆是一种半液体的肥料，这样才不至于流散）。他上追肥是集中一次施下。表面上看来，他没有接受分期施肥的道理；实际上，他是结合具体情况这样做的，仍然是符合分期施肥的精神的。因为他用的粉浆肥料是一种分解很慢的迟效肥料。他所种的“大粒红”品种，生长期只有一百天左右，假若分期施肥，在后期施用的便使不上劲。而且，他施的粉浆肥料，需要施在坑穴里，假若不一次在幼苗期施用，而分期在苗高大时再挖穴施用时，就很容易伤害玉米根部及茎叶。当地雨量都集中在七、八月，玉米生长前期干旱无雨。他这样一次在早期施用足够的基肥，既可供给根部吸收，又没有流失的危险；同时，施肥后肥料慢慢分解，正可赶上玉米抽穗开花后对肥料的迫切需要。
    第五、他用控制浇水的办法，促进玉米生长
    和发挥肥料效力。
    他种的玉米地是水浇地；他浇水掌握了两个基本精神：第一，他利用水分来控制玉米的生长发育；第二，他配合肥料的施用，借浇水来适时发挥肥料的作用。当地玉米播种时正是干旱少雨的季节。据他的经验：播种后一天，需要浇一次小水，以利种子发芽。如遇雨水多，就不浇水。在玉米幼苗期，不宜浇水，只要不使苗旱死就行。这样既可以控制玉米的生长，不使过旺，又可使幼苗粗壮，扎根较深，以培育后期生长的潜在力量。这种情况当地农民群众叫“胎里宏”。当玉米长出，植株生长到三尺高时，便需要连续浇水。这时正当玉米需水需肥最迫切的时期，浇水后可供给玉米所需要的水分，使茎叶迅速生长；并且可以使肥料发挥功效。因为他的玉米地是砂质壤土，保水性不强，这时当地气候正炎热多风，蒸发作用很大，所以他一般都采取浇透水的办法。一直到玉米灌浆期，才停止浇水。
    第六、他注意提高中耕除草和培土的技术，
    供给玉米生长的良好条件。
    他在锄草方面，有一套很好的技术。在不同时期，他用不同深度的中耕，来贯彻除草、保墒、促进根部发育等作用。播种后七天，幼苗出土后，实行第一次浅锄（深约寸半）。这次锄的目的，主要是除去杂草和疏松表层土壤，减少水分的蒸发，使幼苗发育良好。施追肥后，苗高四寸时，锄第二遍。这次要深锄。因为这时幼苗只有临时根，锄时不易碰伤。深锄后不但易使杂草死亡不再发芽，而且可以使土壤疏松，帮助玉米的永久根深扎，使幼苗发育健壮。苗长高到三尺时，锄第三遍。这时根部发育已健全，不宜深锄。因为深了容易使根部损伤，所以锄得愈浅愈好，而且下锄离根部要远一些，划破地皮达到除草保墒的目的就行。在锄第三遍时，要注意把行间的土培到根部。因为当地每年到这时风很大，这样培土后可以使玉米抗风力强，并且还可把杂草埋死。以后玉米生长很旺盛，杂草也不易发生，而且茎叶密布，便不必再锄了。
    从上面的几个特点看来，杨逢成麦茬玉米获得丰产不是偶然的。丰产的主要原因是他掌握了自然环境和玉米生长的规律，全面地改进技术，因而使每个增产因子都发挥了应有的作用。例如当地气候季节比较晚，一年两作，地力没有休闲的时间，他便用在前作多施肥料培育地力的办法来解决自然气节和作物生长时期的矛盾。有了良好的地力，再和选育良种、密植相结合，因此发挥了增产效能。又如玉米在幼苗期需要稍旱，到后期需要多量水分，当地气候又多是夏初干旱；他掌握了这些自然规律，因此早期施肥而后期浇水，使肥料和水分充分配合。他的技术是很合乎科学道理的。他为什么能掌握这一系列的合乎科学原理的耕作技术呢？这和他的政治觉悟是分不开的。他在旧社会里是一个雇工，受尽了地主阶级的压迫；土地改革时分得了土地，因此生产情绪特别高涨。在一九四七年土地改革时，因许多农民不了解政策，曾发生了大吃大喝、浪费胜利果实的现象，这时杨逢成因为觉悟较高，专心于生产。他分到土地后勤劳节约，把所有力量都投入生产。他和同村王景斌共同给军属王永明代耕三亩地，他总是主张先给军属及时耕种。他总是尽先响应人民政府的号召。如一九四八年政府号召选种，他便首先实行；他从多方面钻研技术，创造了山东玉米产量的最高纪录。此外，他还经营副业来支持农业生产。当地多以做粉条为副业。他除做粉条外，并兼做豆腐，增加收入，来扩大再生产。并用豆腐渣喂猪，粉浆做肥料。他的肥料充足，也是他能够丰产的一个重要原因。
