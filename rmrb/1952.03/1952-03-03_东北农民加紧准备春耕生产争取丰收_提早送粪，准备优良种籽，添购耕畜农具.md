Northeast China's vast rural areas are intensifying preparations for this year's spring ploughing and production. Preparations include accumulating manure, delivering manure, selecting seeds, replacing seeds, purchasing draft animals and farm tools, and building water conservancy projects. The scale of this year's preparations indicates that the scale of agricultural production in Northeast China this year will greatly exceed that of previous years.

Last winter, a manure accumulation campaign was launched throughout Northeast China, and farmers in various regions are still intensifying manure accumulation. Farmers in Heilongjiang Province, who have not traditionally used fertilizer, accumulated more than 7 billion jin of various fertilizers last winter. This number is higher than in any previous year and is enough to fertilize 35 percent of the province's cultivated land. However, in order to ensure that half of the province's cultivated land can be fertilized with base fertilizer this year, farmers are now launching a campaign to "collect manure for ten more mu of land per household." Many good mutual aid teams have accumulated enough fertilizer for all the cultivated land of the entire team. The Dong Dianfu mutual aid team in Zhaodong County has already accumulated the fertilizer needed for all the team's more than 400 mu of land. Thanks to the vigorous organization by the People's Government to send urban manure to the countryside, the quality of manure accumulated in various regions this year is also higher than in previous years. Manure delivery also started earlier than in previous years. To alleviate the spring rush, farmers in various regions began delivering manure to the fields around the Spring Festival. In Zhuanghe County, Liaodong Province, where the season is earlier, more than 80 percent of farmers delivered manure to the fields before the Spring Festival.

Preparing good-quality seeds for spring planting is one of the main tasks of the current preparations for farming. Northeast China will strive to promote high-quality varieties of various crops on 20 million mu this year, requiring a total of 200 million jin of high-quality seeds at ten jin per mu. Currently, 160 million jin of high-quality seeds have been loaned and exchanged by farmers in Northeast China, and another 40 million jin will be promoted before spring ploughing. In this way, the area of high-quality varieties planted in Northeast China this year will be more than double that of last year. In addition, various regions have mobilized women, children, and other semi-labor forces to re-select the seeds retained from last year. The Yu Xuefeng and Huangfu Xuan model mutual aid teams in Panshi County, Jilin Province, have selected more than 10,000 jin of high-quality rice seeds. Farmers in Dazili Village, Yixian County, Liaoxi Province, have selected more than 3,000 jin of "Guan Nong No. 1" cotton seeds in three days. The purity of these seeds is above 90 percent.

In order to expand this year's agricultural production, farmers in Northeast China have used their income from sideline production last winter and the surplus grain from last year's bumper harvest to purchase production materials. According to incomplete statistics from eight counties in Liaodong, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang provinces, farmers have purchased more than 4,100 head of draft animals such as cattle and horses, more than 1,340 carts, and more than 168,000 jin of various crop seeds with the income from sideline production and the proceeds from selling surplus grain. In order to strictly prevent various natural disasters, farmers in Northeast China are also very active in drought prevention and insect control. Farmers in Liaoxi and Rehe provinces, which suffered from severe spring droughts last year, have now begun to dig canals, drill wells, and purchase water diversion equipment. Some districts and villages in Yixian County, Liaoxi Province, have purchased more than 90 waterwheels. The Zhengfu mutual aid team in Xinjuzi Village, Longhua County, Rehe Province, while delivering manure, mobilized all members of the team to repair twelve canals. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北农民加紧准备春耕生产争取丰收
    提早送粪，准备优良种籽，添购耕畜农具
    东北广大农村正在加紧准备今年的春耕生产。准备的内容有积肥，送粪，选种，换种，购置耕畜农具，兴修水利等。从今年准备工作的规模就可以看出，今年东北区的农业生产的规模将大大地超过往年。
    去年冬天，东北各地展开了积肥运动，现在各地农民还在加紧积肥。一向没有施肥习惯的黑龙江省农民在去年冬季已积存各种肥料达七十多亿斤。这个数目比以往任何一年为多，足够全省耕地面积百分之三十五施用。但是，农民为争取今年全省有一半耕地能施基肥，现在又展开了“每户多拣十亩地粪”的运动。不少好的互助组，已积存足够全组全部耕地施用的肥料。肇东县董殿福互助组，就已把全组四百多亩地所需的肥料都积下了。由于人民政府大力组织城粪下乡，今年各地所积粪肥的质量，也较往年为高。送粪也比往年早。为了调剂春忙，各地农民在春节前后，就已开始将粪肥送往地里。季节较早的辽东省庄河县，春节以前往地里送粪的农户，就达百分之八十以上。
    准备好春种的优良种籽，是当前备耕工作的主要内容之一。东北今年将争取推广两千万亩各种作物的优良品种，以每亩用种籽十斤计共需二亿斤优良种籽。现在，东北各地贷发和由农民互换的优良种籽已达一亿六千万斤，春耕前准备再推广四千万斤，这样，东北今年种值优良品种的面积将比去年扩大一倍以上。此外，各地又发动妇女、儿童等半劳动力，普遍把去年选留的种籽再精选一遍。吉林省磐石县禹学奉和皇甫宣两个模范互助组，已选出优良稻种一万多斤；辽西省义县大籽粒村的农民，在三天之内就已精选出“关农一号”棉种三千多斤。这些种籽的纯度都在百分之九十以上。
    为了扩大今年的农业生产，东北各地的农民纷纷用去冬副业生产的收入和去年丰收的余粮来添购生产资料。据辽东、松江、黑龙江三省八个县的不完全统计，农民已用副业生产的收入和卖余粮所得购进牛、马等耕畜四千一百多头，大车一千三百四十多辆，各种作物种籽十六万八千多斤。为了严防各种自然灾害，东北各地农民对防旱和防虫等工作也很积极。去年春旱比较严重的辽西和热河两省的农民，现已开始挖渠、打井和购置引水用具。辽西省义县部分区、村，已购置水车九十多部。热河省隆化县新局子村郑福互助组，在与送粪同时，发动全组人员修了水渠十二道。（新华社）
