    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 29th: Shanghai has systematically and gradually educated and trained 600,000 workers and shop assistants in private factories and shops, who are now actively involved in the "Five-Anti" movement. Before the movement even began, the Shanghai Municipal Production Increase and Economy Committee had widely mobilized workers and shop assistants to report illegal activities of law-breaking capitalists. By February 20th, over 300,000 pieces of evidence reported by workers and shop assistants had been collected. To systematically and gradually mobilize the masses to participate in the "Five-Anti" movement, Shanghai first trained over 10,000 workers and shop assistants as key personnel for the movement. These workers and shop assistants, except for a portion prepared to join the "Five-Anti" inspection teams, were all投入 into mobilizing the masses. Starting from March 17th, the Municipal Production Increase and Economy Committee concentrated the strength of mass organizations such as workers, youth, and women, and established specialized leadership organizations for mobilizing the masses at both the municipal and district levels. Municipal-level mass organizations also dispatched over 400 cadres to help each district mobilize workers and shop assistants. By March 25th, districts had successively trained over 40,000 workers and shop assistants. After being trained, the workers and shop assistants clearly recognized the great significance and guiding principles and policies of the "Five-Anti" movement and were very hostile to law-breaking capitalists. For example, after being trained, the workers of the Hongda Shipyard accused the capitalists of sabotaging the Huai River harnessing project. The奸商 of Hongda Shipyard had cut corners when manufacturing furnaces for the Huai River dredging boats, causing the furnaces to explode, delaying the project and causing serious losses. Various districts also held study classes for senior staff, conducting class education, clarifying policies, and dispelling concerns. In the senior staff study classes in Yangshupu and other districts, senior staff members made accusations and expressed their determination to stand firm, unite with the workers, and expose the illegal crimes of the capitalists. In the senior staff study class in Xincheng District, fifteen people on the spot reported the illegal activities of the capitalists, such as tax evasion.
    When the Shanghai "Five-Anti" movement officially began, all the workers and shop assistants in the city listened to Mayor Chen Yi's broadcast report in an organized manner and generally held discussions. Representatives from the entire staff of the Penglai District Fourth Joint Working Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union Shanghai Municipal Committee and over ten units such as the "Five-Anti" Working Team of Xincheng District presented letters of guarantee at the meeting, after listening to Mayor Chen Yi's report, to fight for the complete victory of the "Five-Anti" movement. After the meeting, more than sixty employees of the Huada Printing Factory in Xincheng District collectively wrote a letter to Mayor Chen Yi, guaranteeing that they would boldly report the illegal activities of the capitalists. The 130,000搬运 workers in the city have mastered a large amount of material on large-scale theft of state property by illegal merchants. They stated that if the奸商 do not confess, they will resolutely report them. Xincheng District received more than 1,700 letters of accusation from workers and shop assistants the day after Mayor Chen Yi's report. After studying Mayor Chen Yi's report, Sun Shoumin, an accountant at the Da Zhongyuan Factory, immediately reported twenty-two facts of the capitalist's illegal activities. Now, the work of mobilizing the masses on a large scale throughout the city is being carried out in an organized and orderly manner.

    上海市广泛发动群众检举违法资本家
    六十万工人店员积极投入战斗
    【新华社上海二十九日电】上海市六十万私营工厂商店的工人店员经有计划有步骤的教育和训练，积极投入“五反”运动。早在运动开始之前，上海市增产节约委员会曾广泛发动工人店员检举违法资本家的违法行为。到二月二十日止，经工人店员检举的材料已达三十多万件。为了有计划有步骤地发动群众参加“五反”运动，上海市首先训练了一万多工人店员，作为运动骨干。这些工人店员除一部分准备参加“五反”检查队外，其余全部投入发动群众工作。从三月十七日开始，市增产节约委员会集中了工人、青年、妇女各群众团体的力量，在市、区两级建立了专门发动群众的领导机构。市级群众团体并抽出了四百多干部帮助各区发动工人店员。到三月二十五日止，各区又先后训练了工人店员达四万多人。经过训练的工人店员，明确认识了“五反”运动的伟大意义和方针政策，对违法资本家非常仇恨。如鸿大船厂工人经训练后，控诉了该厂资方破坏治淮工程的罪行。鸿大船厂奸商在制造治淮挖泥船的炉子时曾大量偷工减料，以致炉子爆破，使工程延迟，造成严重损失。各区并举办了高级职员学习班，进行阶级教育，讲清政策，解除顾虑。在杨树浦等区高级职员学习班上，高级职员纷进行控诉，并表示要站稳立场，和工人团结一起，纷揭发资本家非法罪行。新成区高级职员学习班上，当场就有十五人检举了资方偷漏税款等违法行为。
    上海“五反”运动正式开始时，全市工人店员有组织地收听了陈毅市长的广播报告，并普遍进行了讨论。中国纺织工会上海市委员会蓬莱区第四联合工作委员会全体职工和新成区“五反”工作队等十多单位的代表，在大会上听完陈毅市长的报告后，当场便呈递了为“五反”运动彻底胜利而斗争的保证书。会后新成区华达印刷厂六十多个职工集体写信给陈毅市长，保证要大胆检举资方违法行为。全市十三万搬运工人已掌握了大批违法商人大量盗窃国家资财的材料。他们表示，如果奸商不坦白，他们就坚决检举。新成区在陈毅市长报告后的第二天便接到工人店员的检举信一千七百多件。大中原厂会计孙寿民学习陈毅市长的报告后，立即检举了二十二件资方违法的事实。现在，全市大规模地发动群众的工作，正有组织有秩序地开展。
