We study bacteria to eliminate epidemics for humanity. Over the past hundred years, we have achieved a great deal and have brought much happiness to mankind. Conversely, American imperialism, because its defeat in the Korean War has become irredeemable, is repeating the mistakes of the Japanese invaders by inhumanely using bacteriological weapons in its death throes. It cultivates germs, saturating suitable insects with them, and then uses airplanes to drop these germ-laden insects on our ground. Insects prefer warmth, and especially like to enter human bodies in cold regions, transmitting the germs they carry to people; people then transmit the germs to each other, and a "major epidemic" is unavoidable. This method can also be used to kill other organisms. The intentions of American imperialism are so extremely vicious that they are even worse than beasts. The Chinese and Korean people all hate them to the bone, and all people of conscience around the world are filled with anger. The American aggressors, disregarding the righteous warnings of our country and the people of the world, dare to deny their actions while expanding their crimes to include our Northeast. The Chinese People's Volunteers inspected the insects they dropped and proved that the insects contained germs. Therefore, we should be more vigilant and strictly prepared. Civilian households, in addition to the troops, must understand methods of preventing infection in order to protect their homes and defend the country. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang in our country, diseases such as plague, cholera, and smallpox occurred year after year, and were all very rampant. After liberation, cholera disappeared, plague became rare, and smallpox has also been greatly reduced. We have been able to prevent infectious diseases in this way because we have relied on the masses; the stronger the mass organizations, the greater the power to prevent infection. Therefore, no matter what vicious intentions American imperialism has, we have methods to crush it, as long as the masses are organized immediately. We—bacteriologists, medical and health workers, and other scientific workers—are all warriors fighting to eradicate bacteria. Under the call of Director Fu Lianzhang of the All-China Medical Association, some have already rushed to the front lines, some have participated in rear area work, and some have already registered. Those who have not registered should register quickly. Although I am nearly seventy years old, I am not willing to lag behind, and I am willing to fight alongside the masses to completely smash the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism.

    我们都是扑灭细菌的战士
    中华医学会总会总干事  方石珊
    我们研究细菌，是为人类消灭疫疠，近百年来成绩颇多，为人类谋幸福不少。反之，美帝国主义因为它侵略朝鲜的败局陷于无可挽救之势，再蹈日寇的覆辙，灭绝人性地使用了细菌武器，作它垂死的挣扎。它培养病菌，使病菌饱含在适当的昆虫体内，然后用飞机把这含有病菌的昆虫投在我方地面。昆虫喜好温暖，在寒地上尤其喜好投入人体，传染它所含的病菌于人；人再相传，“疫疠大流行”在所难免了。用这种方法并可杀害其他生物。美帝国主义的企图如此，凶恶已极，实在连野兽都不如。中朝人民无不恨之入骨，全世界稍有良心的人也无不愤怒填胸。美国侵略者不顾我国和全世界人民的正义警告，竟敢一面抵赖，一面扩大其罪行，延及我国东北。我中国人民志愿军检其所投昆虫，证明了虫体含有病菌。因此我们自应更加警惕，严予戒备，部队以外民间住户尤须了解预防传染方法，才能保家卫国。我国国内在国民党匪帮反动统治时期，鼠疫、霍乱、天花等病年年相继发生，且都十分猖獗；解放后，霍乱绝，鼠疫罕见，天花也已大减了。我们能够这样预防传染病，是因为依靠了群众；群众组织越强，预防传染的力量就越大。所以，无论美帝国主义有什么凶恶的企图，我们都有方法粉碎它，只要群众立刻组织起来。我们——细菌学者和医药卫生及其他科学工作者——都是扑灭细菌的战士，在中华医学会总会傅连暲理事长号召之下，或已奔赴前方，或已参加后方工作，或已报名登记，没有登记的也应赶快报名；我虽年近古稀，也不甘落后，愿跟群众一同为彻底粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战而奋斗。
