Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 17th: March 17th marks the third anniversary of the signing of the Korean-Soviet Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement. On the 16th, Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and Pak Hon-yong, Minister of Foreign Affairs, sent telegrams to Joseph Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Nikolai Shvernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and Andrei Vyshinsky, Minister of Foreign Affairs, respectively, to offer congratulations. Kim Il-sung's congratulatory telegram to Stalin is as follows:

To the esteemed Marshal Stalin:

    On the occasion of the third anniversary of the signing of the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, I extend warm congratulations and blessings to you, the Soviet government, and the entire Soviet people, on behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the entire Korean people, and myself.

    The three years since the signing of the Korean-Soviet Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement have clearly demonstrated that this agreement has become a major factor in guaranteeing the various achievements of our republic in its political, economic, and cultural development, and of the Korean people in their struggle against the predatory aggression of American imperialism.

    Mutual assistance with the Soviet Union is the most reliable guarantee for our freedom, independence, and democratic development. Therefore, the Korean people will further strengthen mutual assistance with the Soviet Union, our liberator and true friend, in the future.

    In the fierce struggle against the American and British interventionists, the Korean people are bravely defending their rights to freedom and independence, and are convinced that, on our side, there is the sympathy and political and moral support of the great Soviet people, inspired by the genius Stalin, and of all progressive humanity.

    For the happiness of mankind, peace, and the victory of justice, I wish you—our close friend and mentor—a long and healthy life.

    Kim Il-sung
    Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
