Cultural Briefs

    ▲ To strengthen research on film art theory and creation, the Art Committee of the Central Film Bureau, in addition to compiling and publicly issuing "Film Art Series" and "Film Script Series," also compiles a loose-leaf internal reference material. To more systematically introduce theoretical experience and provide reading opportunities for general readers, starting from March of this year, it will publish "Film Art Data Compendium" (irregularly), distributed by Xinhua Bookstore. The content of the compendium mainly introduces important artistic theories, film reviews, advanced figures in Soviet cinema, and the status of film industries in various People's Democratic countries from newspapers and magazines in the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries, concerning film scripting, directing, and acting. This is a good reading material for film workers, general literary workers, and readers who love film art. The first issue has already been published, focusing on issues such as film creation, with eleven translated articles: "The Urgent Tasks of the Film Industry" (Borsakov), "Further Improving Soviet Film Scriptwriting" (Soviet Art Newspaper Editorial), "Solving the Script Problem is the Primary Task of the Soviet Film Industry" (Roskolov), "The Mutual Obligations of Film Workers and Writers" (Soviet Art Newspaper Editorial), "Striving for the Cooperation of Writers and Film Workers in Their Careers" (Soviet Art Newspaper Editorial), "Film and the Struggle to Defend Peace" (Seton), "The Question of 'Beauty' in Marxist-Leninist Aesthetics" (Ivanov), etc.
    ▲ The Chongqing Teachers' Study Meeting, which began on February 1st and lasted for one month and four days, concluded on March 4th.
    During the study, the teachers, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution, examined the various erroneous and reactionary ideas existing in the current education field in connection with themselves, and focused on criticizing the decadent and degenerate ideas of the bourgeoisie, such as profit-seeking, harming others for self-interest, using public office for private gain, and speculation, and initially demarcated the boundaries between proletarian and non-proletarian ideologies, laying the foundation for the ideological remolding movement in the education field.
    ▲ The trainees of the Tianjin Construction Workers' Political Training Class have completed all the courses and graduated on March 26th.
    The political training class was organized using the winter shutdown period. A total of two thousand construction workers participated in the study. During the two-month study period, each construction worker received class education, cleared up many unclear understandings in the past, and greatly improved their class consciousness. Everyone agreed that the two months of study were very rewarding. They also learned through study that they would go to a socialist and communist society in the future and live a better life, thus further improving their work enthusiasm. In the anti-theft movement, they enthusiastically reported on unscrupulous merchants in the construction industry, and some workers also participated in the "tiger" fighting work, and carried out a resolute struggle against the unscrupulous merchants and the corrupt elements of the publicly-owned construction companies, with great achievements. In addition, after studying, the workers had a further understanding of the Communist Party, and many workers applied to join the Party.
    ▲ The Southern Jiangsu People's Publishing House recently published a four-color comic book "Production Expert Chen Yongkang". The book has clear pictures and prominent themes, and systematically introduces the rice planting experience of the high-yield model Chen Yongkang, in which detailed explanations are given to "staggered fertilization", "sparse planting of seedlings", and "small-plant square close planting".

    一般读者获得阅读机会，自本年三月起，改出“电影艺术资料丛刊”（不定期），由新华书店总经售。丛刊的内容，主要是介绍苏联及各人民民主国家报纸杂志上有关电影编剧、导演、演员等方面重要的艺术理论、影片批评、苏联电影先进人物和各国电影事业的情况等。这是电影工作者和一般文艺工作者及爱好电影艺术的读者的一种良好读物。第一号现已出版，系以电影创作等问题为主，共有十一篇译文：“电影事业的迫切任务”（波尔沙科夫），“进一步提高苏联电影剧作”（苏联艺术报社论），“解决剧本问题是苏联电影事业的首要任务”（罗士阔夫），“电影工作者与作家的相互义务”（苏联艺术报社论）“争取作家与电影工作者事业上的合作”（苏联艺术报社论），“电影与保卫和平的斗争”（塞腾），“马克思列宁主义美学中的‘美’的问题”（依瓦诺夫）等。
    ▲重庆市教师学习会，于二月一日开始，历时一月零四天，已于三月四日结束。
    在学习中，教师们以马克思列宁主义和中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想为武器，联系自己，检查了目前教育界中所存在的各种错误思想和反动思想，并着重地批判了资产阶级唯利是图、损人利己、假公济私、投机取巧等腐朽堕落的思想，初步划清了无产阶级思想和非无产阶级思想界限，为教育界的思想改造运动打下基础。
    ▲天津市建筑工人政治训练班的学员，已经学完全部课程，于三月二十六日结业。
    政治训练班是利用冬季停工期间组织的。参加学习的建筑工人共两千人。在两个多月的学习期间，每个建筑工人都受到了阶级教育，清除了过去许多模糊不清的认识，大大提高了阶级觉悟。大家一致认为两个月的学习，收获很大。他们还通过学习，知道了将来要到社会主义、共产主义社会，过更美好的生活，因而更加提高了工作积极性。在反盗窃运动中，他们曾热烈地检举营造业的奸商，有部分工人还参加了打“虎”工作，和奸商以及公营建筑公司的贪污分子进行了坚决的斗争，有很大的成绩。此外，工人们经过学习，对共产党也有了进一步的认识，很多工人提出了申请入党的要求。
    ▲苏南人民出版社最近出版了一本“生产能手陈永康”四色连环画。该书画面鲜明，主题突出，系统地介绍了丰产模范陈永康的水稻种植经验，其中对“分期施肥”、“落谷稀”、“小株方形密植”等都作了详细的说明。
