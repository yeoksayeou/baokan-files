To the Editor: Zhang Xuzhan is a young lathe operator at the Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Factory. He is experienced and willing to delve into things, and everyone respects and loves him. Last November, the veteran worker Yang Wenchang and others, who had returned from a visit to Beijing, established an experimental group to promote the high-speed cutting method within the factory. Zhang Xuzhan was extremely excited and secretly vowed, "Chairman Mao! In order to increase production and practice economy, I must learn the high-speed cutting method well." After listening to the introduction of the theory and application methods of this advanced Soviet experience, he began to feel disappointed. He thought, "Our factory uses belt-driven lathes and doesn't have hard alloy tools. How can we apply the high-speed cutting method?" The secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, in order to dispel his ideological concerns, told him to take it slowly. The veteran worker Yang Wenchang also repeatedly explained that the factory's existing alloy tools and machine tool equipment could still be used with this method, and he took the lead in experimenting for everyone to see. Yang Wenchang's experiment was successful, which gave Zhang Xuzhan great encouragement. The next day, the administrative department assigned the task of machining the headstock center of an eighteen-foot lathe. He used the high-speed cutting method to operate for the first time. He ran the lathe very fast, and as a result, a job that used to take fifty-six work hours now only took twenty work hours to complete. Now, he has become an expert in high-speed cutting, and his productivity has increased by an average of five times. He said excitedly and enthusiastically, "I have further realized the meaning of 'Sino-Soviet friendship'!"

    张绪湛学了高速切削法工作效率提高五倍
    编辑同志：张绪湛是江汉船舶机械二厂的青年车工。他有经验，又肯钻研，大家都敬爱他。去年十一月，从北京参观回来的老工人杨问长等成立了一个试验小组，准备在厂内推广高速切削法。张绪湛兴奋极了，暗自宣誓道：“毛主席！为了增产节约，我一定学好高速切削法。”当他听了这种苏联先进经验的理论和运用方法的介绍以后，他开始失望了。他想：“我们厂里用的是皮带车床，又没有硬质合金刀，怎样运用高速切削法呢？”青年团支部书记为了解除他的思想顾虑，告诉他要慢慢地来。老工人杨问长也一再说明厂里现有的合金刀和机床设备一样能使用这个方法，并带头实验给大家看。杨问长的实验成功了，这给了张绪湛很大的鼓励。第二天，行政方面交下车十八尺车床的车头心子的任务。他第一次运用高速切削法来操作，他把车头打得飞快，结果，过去需要五十六个工时的活，现在只要二十个工时就做成了。现在，他已成为高速切削的能手，生产率平均提高了五倍。他兴奋而热情地说：“我进一步体会到‘中苏友好’的意义了！”    杨照明
