    Launching Senior Staff of Private Enterprises to Encircle and Suppress Big Profiteers
    Jiang Heng

    Experience in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places has proven that winning over and uniting senior staff and older shop assistants in private enterprises is a crucial step in achieving victory in the anti-theft struggle. In this anti-theft struggle, many senior staff members have shed the ideological influence imposed upon them by capitalists, shattered concerns about "personal relationships," "harming one's karma," and "heavenly justice," and launched face-to-face struggles against illegal capitalists. Many senior staff members who had familial ties to the capitalists also bravely broke through layers of ideological obstacles and returned to the ranks of the working class. For example, Chen Hui, an accountant at the Xie Nong Rice Mill in Guangzhou, broke through the three lines of defense of "the boss is my father-in-law, the manager is my brother-in-law, and my brother is a shareholder," and became a brave warrior against unscrupulous merchants. There are many such exemplary cases of bravely exposing illegal capitalists. Experience in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places has shown that when senior staff are mobilized, the anti-theft struggle rapidly deepens due to the sudden increase in exposed materials. Facts prove that uniting senior staff has great significance in the struggle to encircle and suppress major thieves. This is because they know the capitalists' secrets best. As long as they participate in the movement, the illegal capitalists will be completely isolated and will have no choice but to bow their heads and confess their crimes.

    However, some regions have only focused on mobilizing workers and shop assistants and have paid little or no attention to winning over and uniting senior staff. As a result, the movement's progress has been slow. The reason for this situation is, of course, due to the deceitful nature of illegal capitalists and the hesitation of senior staff, but the main reason is that these regions have not attached enough importance to mobilizing senior staff. The reasons for this are often due to some vague understandings of the class status of senior staff and their preferential treatment. Therefore, hesitation and timidity have been displayed in this work.

    Some people have doubts such as: "Are senior staff capitalists? Are they labor? Or are they neither capitalists nor labor?" Therefore, they dare not boldly carry out the work of winning over and uniting senior staff. Some even regard senior staff as "capitalist figures," which is even more wrong. This is because they only see that senior staff are in the position of "assistant" to the capitalists and enjoy higher treatment than ordinary workers and shop assistants, while ignoring the most basic aspect that senior staff are also wage laborers. It is undeniable that senior staff do have a certain status in private enterprises, and their treatment is indeed preferential. Many people have even been co-opted by the capitalists, bought shares, become the capitalists' "confidants" and "right-hand men," and participated in the capitalists' illegal activities. But if they have not changed their employed status of relying on labor income to maintain their lives, then they are still part of the working class. Therefore, in the anti-theft struggle, whether from the perspective of expanding the results of the battle or strengthening the ranks, the work of winning over and uniting senior staff should not be ignored.

    There are also some people who, although they believe that senior staff should be united, also believe that "some senior staff are relatives of the capitalists and have participated in the capitalists' illegal activities, and they have the most concerns and are difficult to mobilize"; therefore, they are constrained and hesitant. Indeed, senior staff have the most concerns. Among them, those whose hands are not clean are afraid of "getting burned," afraid of "returning stolen goods," and afraid of "going to jail"; those whose hands are clean worry that they will "not be able to get more dividends or salary increases" because of exposing illegal capitalists, "not be able to be the boss," and even worry that "the business will close and they will lose their jobs." In short, they have these four fears: fear of being implicated, fear of retaliation, fear of losing their jobs, and fear of a falling out. However, experience in some places has shown that the reason why senior staff have so many concerns is mainly because they have been deceived by illegal capitalists and do not understand their class status and the policies of the anti-theft struggle. Therefore, as long as various methods can be used to expose the deceptive tricks of illegal capitalists, make them draw a clear line between classes, understand that the government's policy towards senior staff is to win them over and unite them, and point out the path they should take, then these concerns will be easily resolved. Even if some people are deeply poisoned and stubbornly refuse to come to their senses, this is, after all, a very small number. Therefore, although there are many difficulties in the work of winning over and uniting senior staff, as long as we earnestly mobilize them and can "prescribe the right medicine," the difficulties will surely be overcome.

    How to mobilize senior staff? According to materials from various places, the main methods of mobilizing senior staff are to conduct class education, explain policies to eliminate their concerns, enable them to let go of their burdens, return to the ranks of the working class, and join the battle to encircle and suppress big profiteers.

    The specific methods for winning over and uniting senior staff to participate in the battle, in addition to holding general meetings for mobilization, the most effective methods are to mobilize them to conduct recollections and accusations, hold "anti-theft movement training classes for senior staff," and hold forums. Mobilizing older shop assistants by using the methods of recalling and accusing capitalists of illegal exploitation and abuse is more practical and effective. Many older shop assistants have endured their way out of the status of slaves and beasts of burden year after year. In decades of shop assistant life, they have been deceived and co-opted by capitalists, and their class consciousness has gradually become blurred; but because they have suffered long-term exploitation and abuse, they also have a certain degree of class awareness, so after recalling and accusing, they are able to see through the capitalists' deception and return to the ranks of the working class, and join the battle to fight back against the bourgeoisie. Holding senior staff training classes and convening senior staff forums can train a large number of activists in a very short time, and can also exchange combat experience and organize combat teams. The educational methods used in training classes and forums are generally to conduct discussions and explanations in connection with reality, and sometimes, in order to enable senior staff to specifically understand the ugliness of the bourgeoisie and improve their class awareness, it is also necessary to adopt methods of recalling and accusing. Many senior staff and older shop assistants in Tianjin and other places have drawn a clear line between classes, eliminated concerns, washed their hands clean, and sworn to go into battle after such study and mobilization. Some even launched competitions with each other to capture big profiteers.

    In order to mobilize all senior staff, it is not enough to only run training classes and convene forums; it is also necessary to adopt the methods of "staff uniting staff," "workers and shop assistants uniting staff," and "breakthroughs at key points." For example, the capital of the Changsha Fu Feng Rice Mill had many illegal activities, but because Huang Kezhao, the staff member of this factory, had many concerns and dared not expose them, this "fortress" could not be captured for a long time. At this time, Liu Hanshi, the accountant of the Xin He Rice Mill, patiently won over and united Huang Kezhao by explaining policies, providing education and persuasion, and understanding his ideological background, and finally mobilized Huang Kezhao to expose the illegal activities of the capital. After accountant Liu Hanshi "broke through" this "key point," he used this method to mobilize more than 60 accountants, cashiers, and runners in the rice milling industry in his district to join the battle. There are many similar examples of uniting senior staff to attack "fortresses." Especially in Beijing and Tianjin, many stubborn large "fortresses" were broken one by one after the work teams mobilized workers, shop assistants, and senior staff. For example, Zi Yaohua (General Manager of Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank and Manager of the Tianjin Branch), the most stubborn large "fortress," was exposed under the siege of shop assistants, staff, and even deputy managers and assistant managers.

    The anti-theft struggle in many regions has entered a tense stage. In order to quickly achieve victory in the struggle, all regions should rely on the broad masses of workers and shop assistants, unite senior staff, older shop assistants, and staff family members, and form a strong team, so that those big profiteers and big thieves have nowhere to hide.

    发动私营企业的高级职员围剿大奸商
    江横
    北京、天津等地的经验证明，争取、团结私营企业中的高级职员、老年店员，是取得反盗窃斗争胜利的重要一环。在这次反盗窃斗争中，有很多高级职员清除了资本家给予他们的思想影响，打破了“人情面子”、“有伤阴德”、“天理良心”等等的顾虑，对不法资本家展开了面对面的斗争。有不少和资方有亲属关系的高级职员，也勇敢地冲破层层思想障碍，回到了工人阶级的队伍。例如广州市协农米机厂会计陈辉，冲破了“老板是岳父，经理是襟兄弟，哥哥是股东”的三道封锁线，成为反对奸商的勇士。像这样勇敢检举违法资本家的模范例子，是很多的。北京、天津等地的经验证明，当高级职员被发动起来之后，由于检举材料的骤然增多，反盗窃斗争迅速走向深入。事实证明，在围剿大盗窃犯的斗争中，团结高级职员具有很大意义。因为他们最摸资本家的底细。只要他们也参加了运动，违法资本家就完全陷于孤立，不得不低头认罪。
    但是，有些地区只注意了发动工人店员，却没有或很少注意争取、团结高级职员的工作。因而运动进展迟滞。造成这种状况的原因，固然是由于不法资本家的刁赖成性，高级职员的犹疑不前，但主要还是由于这些地区没有十分重视发动高级职员的工作。其原因又多是由于对高级职员所处的阶级地位和待遇优厚等问题，有着一些模糊的认识。所以在这一工作中表现了犹豫不决、畏首畏尾。
    有的人存在着这样的疑问：“高级职员是资方？是劳方？还是既非资方，又非劳方呢？”所以不敢大胆进行争取、团结高级职员的工作。有的甚至把高级职员看成是“资方人士”，这就更加错误了。这是因为他们只看到了高级职员所处的是资方“助手”的地位，所享受的待遇又比一般工人店员都高的一面，而忽视了高级职员也是雇佣劳动者这最基本的一面。不可否认，高级职员在私人企业中的确有一定的地位，待遇也的确优厚。甚至不少人受了资方的笼络，入了股子，成为资方的“心腹”、“左右手”，并参与了资方的违法行为。但如果他们并没有因此改变依靠劳动所得维持生活的雇佣地位，那么他们仍然是工人阶级。因之，在反盗窃斗争中，无论从扩大战果或壮大队伍哪一方面说，都不应该忽视争取和团结高级职员的工作。
    还有一些人，虽然也认为应该团结高级职员，但他们又认为“有些高级职员是资方的亲属，而且参与了资方的不法行为，顾虑最多，难能发动”；因而，束手束脚，迟疑不前。的确，高级职员是顾虑最多的。他们之中，手面不大干净的人怕“引火烧身”，怕“退赃”，怕“坐牢”；手面干净的人耽心因检举违法资本家而“不能多分红，多增薪”，“不能当掌柜的”，甚至顾虑“买卖关门，自己失业”。总之，他们有这样的四怕：怕受连累，怕报复，怕失业，怕撕破脸皮。但有些地方的经验证明，高级职员所以有这许多顾虑，主要还是由于受了违法资本家的欺骗，和不了解自己所处的阶级地位以及反盗窃斗争的政策。所以，只要能运用各种方法，揭穿违法资本家的欺骗伎俩，使他们划清阶级界限，认识政府对高级职员是争取、团结的政策，指明他们应走的道路，那么这些顾虑都会迎刃而解的。即使有些人因中毒很深，执迷不悟，但这毕竟是极少数的。因而，争取、团结高级职员的工作，固然存在着不少困难，但只要我们认真去发动他们，并能“对症下药”，困难一定会被战胜的。
    怎样去发动高级职员呢？根据各地的材料来看，发动高级职员的主要方法，是进行阶级教育，讲明政策，以消除他们的顾虑，使他们放下包袱，回到工人阶级队伍，投入围剿大奸商的战斗。
    争取、团结高级职员参加战斗的具体作法，除召开大会进行动员外，最有效的是发动他们进行回忆、控诉、举办“高级职员反盗窃运动训练班”和座谈会。发动老年店员，以采用回忆和控诉资本家非法剥削和虐待的方法，较为切实有效。老年店员很多是从工徒的牛马地位一年一年地熬出来的。在几十年的店员生活中，他们受了资本家的欺骗和笼络，阶级意识逐渐模糊起来；但是因为他们受了长期的剥削和虐待，也有一定程度的阶级觉悟，所以经过回忆和控诉，他们是能够识破资本家的欺骗，而回到工人阶级队伍，投入反击资产阶级的战斗的。举办高级职员训练班和召开高级职员座谈会，能够在很短时间内，训练大批积极分子，并能交流斗争经验和组织战斗队伍。训练班和座谈会所采用的教育方法，一般是联系实际进行讨论、讲解，有时为了使高级职员具体地认识资产阶级的丑恶，提高他们的阶级觉悟，也须要采取回忆和控诉的方法。天津等地不少高级职员和老年店员，就是经过这样的学习和动员后，划清了阶级界限，消除了顾虑，洗净了自己的手脚，而纷纷誓师出征的。有的还相互展开捕捉大奸商的竞赛。
    为了发动全体高级职员，仅仅开办训练班，召开座谈会，还是不够的，还应该采用“职员团结职员”、“工人店员团结职员”、“重点突破”的方法。例如，长沙福丰米厂资方有很多不法行为，但因为这个厂的职员黄克照顾虑很多，不敢检举，以致这个“堡垒”很久攻不下来。这时新和米厂的会计刘汉师，就用讲政策、教育说服、摸思想底的方法耐心争取、团结，终于把黄克照发动起来，检举了资方的不法行为。会计刘汉师“突破”这个“重点”后，又用这一方法，把所在区碾米业的会计、出纳、跑街六十多人，也发动起来投入战斗。类似这样团结高级职员攻打“堡垒”的范例是很多的。特别在北京、天津，有很多顽固的大“堡垒”，都是在工作组发动工人店员和高级职员起来之后，被一一攻破的。例如最顽固的大“堡垒”资耀华（上海商业储蓄银行总经理兼天津分行经理），就是在店员、职员以至副理、襄理的围攻下，而暴露了原形的。
    不少地区的反盗窃斗争已进入紧张阶段，为了迅速取得斗争的胜利，各地应该倚靠广大工人店员群众，团结高级职员、老年店员以及职员家属，组成强大的队伍，使那些大奸商、大盗窃犯无处躲藏。
