Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th: According to TASS, Moscow, 16th, prominent representatives of the Soviet scientific community, serving the cause of peace and progress, held a meeting at the Soviet Academy of Sciences to protest the crimes of American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons.

　　Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, delivered the opening speech. He emphasized that the crimes committed by the exposed American aggressors in Korea and China have aroused the indignation of all progressive mankind. This behavior of the American imperialists, Acheson, and their other representatives is not only despicable, but also cowardly. They use bacteriological weapons, they throw bombs containing deadly microorganisms in the rear at night, attempting to kill peaceful residents, children, the elderly, and women. These facts show that the barbarity of the American imperialists has surpassed that of the German fascists.

　　Nesmeyanov contrasted this despicable and misanthropic behavior of the American imperialists with the progress of culture and science in the Soviet state and the great attention and care of the Soviet government for the welfare of the people and for researching methods to eliminate various diseases. He said that just recently, the Soviet government awarded a first-class Stalin Prize to those who invented a method to eradicate malaria.

　　Subsequently, Soviet scientists spoke one after another, denouncing the inhumane behavior of the American aggressors and the heinous behavior of American scientists who participated in the manufacture of tools for mass human slaughter.

　　Academician Bardin said: The Soviet people declare to the world that the crime of American imperialists in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China must be stopped.

　　Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Kochina said: I cannot express in words my indignation at the heinous crimes committed by the American imperialists now in Korea. I recall the situation when Korean women spoke at the Second Congress of the Women's International Democratic Federation in Budapest, where they talked about their achievements in peaceful labor, describing how they built kindergartens and raised their children. Now the enemies of mankind—American criminals—are committing heinous crimes in Korea. We, along with all honest people in the world, condemn the American aggressors.

　　Among those who spoke at the meeting to denounce the crimes of the American aggressors were also the famous artist and Academician of the Academy of Sciences, Grabar, the famous microbiologist Professor Imshenetsky, and the famous mathematician and Academician of the Academy of Sciences, Lavrentiev. Lavrentiev emphasized that the broad masses of people in various countries are increasingly aware of the great danger to mankind of the policy of launching another war pursued by the American and British imperialists. The use of bacteriological weapons has finally torn off the hypocritical mask of the aggressors and thoroughly exposed the lies of American "civilization" and "democracy." To respond to the atrocities of the war-mongers, honest people in all countries must intensify the struggle to defend peace.

　　The famous Soviet microbiologist Professor Imshenetsky pointed out: Soviet microbiologists work selflessly to save mankind from terrible diseases, while the United States is developing microorganisms in order to extract toxins from them that can destroy human lives. Scientists who use their knowledge to set up "factories of death" are not worthy of being called scientists. Imshenetsky said: We express our contempt for those who use their knowledge to manufacture bacteriological weapons.

　　The meeting passed a resolution expressing the strong protest of Soviet scientists against the use of bacteriological weapons by American aggressors.

    苏联科学界代表举行会议
    抗议美国侵略者使用细菌武器
    号召全世界人民制止美帝国主义这种罪行
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：为和平与进步事业服务的苏联科学界的杰出代表，在苏联科学院举行了会议，抗议美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行。
    苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫院士致开会词。他强调说：已被揭露的美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国所犯的罪行已引起了全体进步人类的愤慨。美帝国主义者、艾奇逊和他们的其他代表的这种行径，不仅是卑鄙的，而且是懦怯的。他们使用细菌武器，他们在夜间到后方去投掷装着致命的微生物的炸弹，企图害死和平居民、儿童、老年人和妇女。这些事实说明：美帝国主义者的野蛮行为已经超过了德国法西斯主义者。
    涅斯米扬诺夫把美帝国主义者的这种卑鄙的、仇视人类的行径，和苏维埃国家中文化和科学的进步以及苏联政府对于人民的福利、对于研究消灭各种疾病的方法的巨大注意和关怀，作了一个对照。他说：正是在最近，苏联政府对发明根除疟疾的方法的人颁发了一等斯大林奖金。
    接着，苏联科学家纷纷发言，斥责美国侵略者的不人道的行为，斥责那些参加制造大规模屠杀人类的工具的美国科学家的可恶行为。
    科学院院士巴尔丁说：苏联人民向全世界宣告，必须制止美帝国主义者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器罪行。
    苏联科学院通讯院士科钦纳说：我无法用言语表达我对美帝国主义者现在朝鲜所犯恶毒罪行的愤慨。我想起朝鲜妇女在布达佩斯国际民主妇女联合会第二次代表大会上讲话的情形，她们谈到她们的和平劳动的成就，描述她们怎样修建幼稚园，并抚育她们的子女。现在人类的死敌——美国罪犯们正在朝鲜犯下滔天罪行。我们和世界上所有正直的人一同谴责美国侵略者。
    在会上发言斥责美国侵略者的罪行的还有名艺术家、科学院院士格拉巴尔，名微生物学家伊姆舍纳茨基教授和名数学家、科学院院士拉甫连节夫等人。拉甫连节夫强调指出，世界各国的广大人民日益认识到：美英帝国主义者所遵循的发动另一次战争的政策对人类会有多么大的危险。细菌武器的使用，终于扯下了侵略者的伪善的面具，彻底地揭穿了美国“文明”和“民主”的谎言。为了回答战争制造者的暴行，各国正直的人们必须加紧保卫和平的斗争。
    著名的苏联微生物学家伊姆舍纳茨基教授指出：苏联微生物学家忘我地工作，把人类从可怕的疾病中拯救出来，而同时，美国却在发展微生物，以便从中提出能够毁灭人类性命的毒素。凡是把他们的知识用于设立“死亡工厂”的科学家，就不配称为科学家。伊姆舍纳茨基说：我们对于那些把他们的知识用于制造细菌武器的人，表示鄙视。
    会议通过了一项决议，表示苏联科学家对美国侵略者使用细菌武器提出强烈抗议。
