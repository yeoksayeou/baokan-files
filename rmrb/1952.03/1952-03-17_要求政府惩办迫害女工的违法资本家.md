    Demanding the Government Punish Illegal Capitalists Who Persecute Female Workers

    To the Editor: After reading the article "Female Workers in Various Regions Accuse Capitalists of Abusing and Persecuting Female Workers" published in the People's Daily on March 8th, I further recognized the cruel and hideous nature of the bourgeoisie. The female workers of New China are working diligently with their hands, actively increasing production for the motherland. However, the illegal capitalists are frantically launching attacks against them with all sorts of despicable and vicious means. How can this be tolerated? In addition to extending our boundless care and sympathy to the persecuted sisters, we must also avenge the injured sisters. First, I want to mobilize the women of Taiyuan City to actively participate in the struggle against corruption, theft of state property, and resolutely repel the bourgeoisie's arrogant attacks. Second, I will pay attention to the situation of female workers in private factories throughout Taiyuan City and resolutely protect the welfare of female workers. Finally, I request the local people's governments in the areas mentioned in the article to severely punish these illegal capitalists who violate women's rights according to the law. Without doing so, public anger cannot be appeased, and the leadership of the working class cannot be consolidated. We working women must draw a clear class line and vow to fight the illegal capitalists to the end.

    要求政府惩办迫害女工的违法资本家
    编辑同志：人民日报三月八日刊载了“各地女工控诉资本家虐待和迫害女工罪行”一文，我看后更认识了资产阶级的残酷、丑恶本质。新中国的女工们，用她们的双手辛勤劳动，为祖国增加生产积极工作着。但违法资本家竟丧心病狂地以种种卑鄙恶毒的手段向她们进攻，这难道是可以容忍的吗？我们除向被迫害的姐妹们致无限的关怀与慰问外，还要给被伤害的姐妹们报仇。首先我要发动太原市的妇女们积极参加反贪污、反盗窃国家财富斗争，坚决打退资产阶级的狂妄进攻；其次我要注意全太原市私营工厂女工的情况，坚决保护女工的福利；最后我要求该文中所指出事地点的各该地人民政府，应依法严惩这批侵犯妇女人权的违法资本家。因为不如此，不能平民愤，更不能巩固工人阶级的领导权。我们劳动妇女们必须划清阶级界限，誓与违法资本家斗争到底。
