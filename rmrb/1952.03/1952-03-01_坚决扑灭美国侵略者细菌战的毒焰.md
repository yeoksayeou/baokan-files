    Resolutely Extinguish the Poisonous Flames of the American Aggressors' Germ Warfare
    The American aggressors' towering crime of conducting large-scale germ warfare on the Korean battlefield, and murdering Chinese and Korean people's soldiers and Korean people, has aroused unanimous angry condemnation from the Chinese and Korean people and righteous condemnation from just public opinion all over the world. This has caused the American aggressors, who have a guilty conscience, to feel extremely terrified, and they have not hesitated to use all kinds of base and shameless means to try to deny their crimes and try to shirk their bloody responsibility completely. However, this shameless denial by the American aggressors is a futile attempt. Their crimes are irrefutable and absolutely undeniable.
    The "United Nations Command Headquarters" of the American side, responsible for directing germ warfare in Korea, "has made no comment" on the angry condemnation of the Chinese and Korean people and the inhuman crimes they have committed. Then, on February 26, "an officer in charge" of the US Eighth Army came forward to "deny" to a reporter from the American International News Service that "bacteriological weapons have been used in the Korean War." Other spokesmen for the US side even dared to slander us as "lying." However, the crimes of the American invading army's aircraft continuously scattering a large number of various poisonous insects carrying plague, cholera, and other infectious disease germs in our front and rear areas in Korea since January 28 of this year are based on conclusive evidence and cannot be denied in any way. The more the American aggressors quibble, the more they can only prove that they have a guilty conscience, and the more they prove that they are not only the extremely brutal enemies of world security and justice, but also extremely hateful and sickening demons who slander people with blood.
    People remember that in August of last year, in order to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations, the American aggressors murdered Yao Qingxiang, the platoon leader of our military police, and sent planes to invade the airspace of the Kaesong neutral zone at night to bomb and strafe the area near the dormitory of our negotiating delegation. They also attempted to describe their murder as a "fabrication" by the Chinese and Korean people aimed at breaking off the negotiations. However, the iron facts finally forced the American aggressors, who were accustomed to making false accusations, to admit their mistakes in provoking the disruption of the Korean armistice negotiations. Now, the American aggressors are once again using their usual shameless tricks of denying crimes and making false accusations. This will have no other effect than to fully expose their heinous and despicable faces in front of the peace-loving people of the world.
    The American aggressors, who have a guilty conscience and are accustomed to shameless denial, have fallen into extreme confusion in their own deceptive propaganda because they cannot change the iron facts. Sometimes they say that "North Korea may already have a real epidemic," and sometimes they say that "there is no evidence to prove that a large-scale epidemic has occurred in the territory controlled by the Communist army"; sometimes they describe the disaster caused by their spreading of bacteria in Korea as a "real epidemic caused by natural causes," and sometimes they describe this disaster as being caused by the Chinese and Korean People's Army "using dirty bandages and eating rancid food." The reason why the American aggressors behave so confusedly is enough to show how intolerable their inhuman and brutal crimes are to mankind. Therefore, they have to fabricate such completely contradictory nonsense to shirk their responsibility to "natural causes" or to the crimes of unconscionable traitors lurking within our country who secretly harmed Chinese volunteer soldiers. The American aggressors' shameless trick of shirking responsibility is of course extremely clumsy and ridiculous. Since the Chinese people are determined to eliminate traitors from within and punish them severely, they will inevitably have the same determination and courage to strike and punish the American aggressors who spread bacteria in the front and rear of Korea.
    Now, in order to promptly extinguish the epidemic diseases spread by the American aggressors in Korea, the Chinese people have dispatched excellent medical workers to Korea to work. This is a just action by the Chinese people to continue to vigorously support the Korean front and the Korean people. Chinese and Korean people's soldiers are fighting heroically on the Korean front, resisting the American aggressors' mad attacks, in order to defend the Chinese and Korean people and peace in the Far East. Their indomitable fighting spirit has won the common respect of peace-loving people all over the world. Now, the American aggressors are attempting to harm Chinese and Korean people's soldiers and Korean people with large-scale weapons of mass destruction, which cannot but make the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world more actively rise up and strengthen the fight against the inhuman American aggressors with actions to support the Korean front and the Korean people. The Chinese excellent medical workers going to the front and rear of Korea, and the efforts they will make there in the future, will undoubtedly give great encouragement to the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers and the Korean people who are fighting heroically, so that they can fight more resolutely and more bravely, resolutely extinguish the poisonous flames of the American aggressors' germ warfare, until the American aggressors withdraw their sinister and bloody hands of spreading bacteria and are forced to accept a just peace.
    The American aggressors' heinous and bloody crimes can only further urge us to intensify the great struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The American aggressors' towering crime of conducting germ warfare must be severely punished as it deserves, the poisonous flames of germ warfare they have released must be completely extinguished, and the civilization, justice, and security of mankind must be consolidated and guaranteed!

### 坚决扑灭美国侵略者细菌战的毒焰

    坚决扑灭美国侵略者细菌战的毒焰
    美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上大规模进行细菌战、杀害中朝人民战士和朝鲜人民的滔天罪行，已经引起了中朝人民的一致愤怒声讨和全世界公正舆论的正义斥责。这使贼胆心虚的美国侵略者感到万分惊恐，因而他们竟不惜使用各种卑鄙无耻的手段企图抵赖，企图把他们的血腥罪责推卸得一干二净。但是，美国侵略者的这种无耻抵赖是枉费心机的。他们的罪行是铁证如山绝对抵赖不掉的。
    负责指挥在朝鲜进行细菌战的美方“联合国军司令部”，对中朝人民的愤怒声讨和他们自己所犯的灭绝人性的罪行，始则“一直没有发表任何评论”，继则在二月二十六日由美国第八军的“一位负责军官”出面向美国国际新闻社的记者“否认”“在朝鲜战争中使用过细菌战武器”，美方的其他发言人甚至于竟敢污蔑我方为“撒谎”。然而，美国侵略军的飞机自本年一月二十八日起，连续向朝鲜我方的前线和后方大量地撒布了带有鼠疫、霍乱及其他传染病菌的各种毒虫的罪行是证据确凿的，是无论如何不能狡赖的。美国侵略者愈狡赖，只能愈加证明他们做贼心虚，愈加证明他们不但是世界安全和正义的极端残暴的敌人，而且是令人极端憎恶和呕心的含血喷人的妖魔。
    人们都记得，美国侵略者在去年八月为了破坏朝鲜停战谈判而谋杀了我方军事警察排长姚庆祥，并派遣飞机夜间侵入开城中立区上空轰炸和扫射我方谈判代表团宿舍附近地区之后，也曾企图把它们的谋杀罪行说成是中朝人民旨在破裂谈判的“捏造”。但是铁的事实最后迫使惯于血口喷人的美国侵略者也不得不对他们破坏朝鲜停战谈判的挑衅行为承认错误。如今美国侵略者竟又把他们惯于使用的抵赖罪行、血口喷人的无耻伎俩再一次耍弄出来，这除了在全世界爱好和平人民面前充分暴露出它们的穷凶极恶而又卑鄙龌龊的面目之外，是不会有其他的作用的。
    做贼心虚而又惯于无耻抵赖的美国侵略者，因为不能改变铁的事实，已使他们自己的欺骗宣传陷于极端混乱的地步。他们时而说“北朝鲜可能已经真正有瘟疫流行”，时而又说“现在没有迹象证明共军控制的领地中发生大规模的瘟疫”；他们时而把他们在朝鲜撒布细菌所造成的灾害说成是“自然原因造成的真正流行病”，时而又把这种灾害说成是由于中朝人民军队“用过污秽的绷带、吃过腐臭的食物”而造成的。美国侵略者们之所以表现得如此混乱，正足以说明它们的灭绝人性的残暴罪行是如何的不能容于人类，因而它们就不得不编造出这种前后完全矛盾的胡言乱语，来把它们的罪责推卸给“自然原因”或者是潜藏在我国内部的丧尽天良的奸商们暗害中国志愿军战士的罪行身上。美国侵略者的这种推卸罪责的无耻伎俩当然是极端笨拙可笑的。中国人民既然有决心从自己的内部肃清奸商并对它们施以严厉的惩罚，也就必然有同样的决心和勇气，打击并惩罚在朝鲜的前线和后方撒布细菌的美国侵略者。
    现在，为了及时扑灭美国侵略者在朝鲜所散布的疫病，中国人民已派遣了优秀的医务工作者前往朝鲜进行工作。这是中国人民继续大力支援朝鲜前线与朝鲜人民的正义行动。中朝人民战士在朝鲜前线英勇作战，抵抗美国侵略者的疯狂进攻，是为了保卫中朝人民和远东和平，他们的不屈不挠的战斗精神博得了全世界爱好和平人民的共同敬爱。如今，美国侵略者却企图以大规模毁灭人类的细菌武器来残害中朝人民战士和朝鲜人民，这不能不使得中国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民更加积极奋起，以支援朝鲜前线和朝鲜人民的行动，来加强对灭绝人性的美国侵略者的打击。中国优秀的医务工作者前往朝鲜的前线和后方，以及他们今后在那里所作的努力，无疑地会给英勇战斗中的中朝人民战士和朝鲜人民以极大的鼓舞，使他们更加坚决、更加英勇地作战，坚决扑灭美国侵略者的细菌战的毒焰，直到美国侵略者缩回它们撒布细菌的罪恶血手，被迫接受一个公正的和平为止。
    美国侵略者的穷凶极恶的血腥罪行，只能更加促使我们加紧抗美援朝的伟大斗争。美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行必须得到应得的严厉的惩罚，他们所施放的细菌战的毒焰必须被彻底扑灭，人类的文明、正义和安全必须得到巩固的保障！
