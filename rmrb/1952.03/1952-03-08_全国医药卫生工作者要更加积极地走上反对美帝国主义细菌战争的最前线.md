    The heinous American aggressors have recently intensified their actions, becoming increasingly frantic. While spreading large numbers of bacteria-carrying insects on the Korean front and in the rear, they have disregarded the just warnings of the people of China and the world, and have extended the flames of their germ warfare to the northeastern region of our country. From February 29th to March 5th, large numbers of planes were continuously used to spread bacteria-carrying insects in Fushun, Xinmin, Andong, Kuandian, Linjiang, and other places. This inhumane crime can only further arouse the indignation of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world. It once again demonstrates the U.S. imperialists' deliberate plot to expand their war of aggression and their ambition to resolutely antagonize human civilization and justice. There is no other way to deal with this gang of 20th-century savages than to give them a forceful counterattack and completely shatter their arrogant attempts.
    We want to warn the American aggressors that no matter what brutal crimes you commit, you will not be able to salvage your inevitable defeat. The war of the past year and more has proven this, and the fate of the Japanese aggressors who once used bacteriological weapons has also proven this. You will surely be subjected to a just trial. We call on the people of the world to pay serious attention to the crimes of the American aggressors, to mobilize urgently, and to take active action to stop this crime in order to defend human peace, justice, science, and civilization.
    We, the Chinese medical and health workers, have transformed our anger into strength and, together with other biological scientists, have stepped to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare. The first batch of volunteer epidemic prevention and inspection teams have arrived on the Korean front; from the National General Council of the Chinese Medical Association downwards, specialized committees for the prevention of bacterial warfare have been established in various places; those who voluntarily sign up to join the epidemic prevention teams are constantly increasing, and some have even written blood letters to express their determination; epidemic prevention medicines and vaccines are being produced in large quantities and supplied steadily. We have complete confidence in shattering the enemy's vicious plot. On behalf of the Chinese Medical Association, I once again call on all medical and health workers in the country to take more active action, strengthen research work, carry out epidemic prevention propaganda, improve epidemic prevention technology, increase the production of epidemic prevention medicines, exert the greatest strength in their respective positions, and be ready to go to the front at any time to fight for the complete crushing of the enemy's germ warfare.

    全国医药卫生工作者要更加积极地走上反对美帝国主义细菌战争的最前线
    中华医学会总会理事长  傅连暲
    万恶滔天的美国侵略军最近变本加厉，愈益疯狂，在朝鲜前线和后方撒布大量细菌毒虫的同时，不顾我国和全世界人民正义的警告，又将其细菌战的毒焰，延烧到我国境内东北地区。二月二十九日至三月五日，连续用大批飞机在抚顺、新民、安东、宽甸、临江等地撒布大量传播细菌的毒虫。此种灭绝人性的罪行，只有更加激起中朝人民和全世界人民的激愤。它再一次地说明了美帝国主义蓄意扩大侵略战争的阴谋，坚决和人类文明正义为敌的野心。对待这群二十世纪的生番，除了予以有力的回击，彻底粉碎其狂妄企图以外，不能有其他的办法。
    我们要警告美国侵略者，任凭你采取怎样残暴的罪行，也挽救不了你无法挽救的惨败。一年多来的战争证明了这一点，曾经使用过细菌武器的日本侵略者的下场也证明了这一点。你们必将遭到正义的裁判。我们要求全世界人民，严重注意美国侵略者的罪行，紧急动员起来，为保卫人类和平、正义、科学、文明，采取积极的行动来制止这种罪行。
    我们中国医药卫生工作者，已经化愤怒为力量，和其他生物科学者一起走上反细菌战争的最前列。第一批志愿防疫检验队已到达朝鲜前线；自中华医学会总会以下，各地均纷纷成立了细菌战防御专门委员会；自动报名要求参加防疫队的更络绎不绝，有的人甚至写来血书表示自己的决心；防疫药品疫苗正大量赶造，源源供应。我们完全有信心粉碎敌人的恶毒阴谋。我代表中华医学会再次号召全国医药卫生工作者，更加积极行动起来，加强研究工作，开展防疫宣传，提高防疫技术，增产防疫药品，在自己的岗位上发挥最大的力量，并随时准备走上前线，为彻底粉碎敌人的细菌战而斗争。
