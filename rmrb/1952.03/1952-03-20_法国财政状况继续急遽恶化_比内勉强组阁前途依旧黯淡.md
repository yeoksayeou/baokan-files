Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The French government crisis, which erupted at the end of last month, lasted for eleven days. It was not until the eleventh of this month that Antoine Pinay of the National Center of Independents and Peasants managed to cobble together a new cabinet. However, the difficult birth of the new cabinet and the continued sharp deterioration of France's financial situation indicate that the new cabinet's prospects remain bleak.

After accepting the task of forming a cabinet, Pinay quickly indicated that he would continue to implement the war preparation plan that pleases his American masters. The first point of his policy program is to recognize France's current policy and fully implement the policies of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc dominated by the United States. In Pinay's new cabinet, the position of Foreign Minister is still held by Schuman, who is notorious for serving Washington slavishly, and Pleven, who is highly appreciated by the Americans for advocating the so-called "European Army" plan, holds the important post of Minister of National Defense.

Although the cabinet was barely formed, the Pinay government is faced with a deepening financial and political crisis. The huge expenses of the Vietnam colonial war and the expansion of armaments have created an ever-increasing deficit. According to existing estimates, France's budget deficit for 1952 will actually reach 1.5 trillion francs, accounting for more than one-third of the total budget. According to the Bank of France's announcement on the 6th, the amount of French currency issued has reached more than 1.88 trillion francs, which is nearly 30 billion more than at the beginning of the year. At the same time, gold and dollar reserves are rapidly depleting. Even Pinay himself admitted that "France is now approaching the edge of disaster," that "there is no money and no taxes to collect," and that "the government has no stable future." Therefore, after the French National Assembly barely passed Pinay's list of government members, the Associated Press issued an ominous prediction: "Pinay will not be in office for long."

### 法国财政状况继续急遽恶化  比内勉强组阁前途依旧黯淡

    法国财政状况继续急遽恶化
    比内勉强组阁前途依旧黯淡
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：上月底爆发的法国政府危机，在延续了十一天之久以后，直到本月十一日才由独立共和农民联盟的比内勉强凑成新阁。但是，新阁的难产和法国财政情况的继续急遽恶化，预示着新阁的前途依旧黯淡。
    比内在接受组阁任务后，很快就表明他将继续执行讨好美国主人的备战计划。他提出的施政纲要的首先一点，便是承认法国的现行政策，全力执行美国主宰下的北大西洋侵略集团的政策。在比内的新阁中，外交部长一职仍由以奴事华盛顿出名的舒曼担任，因倡导所谓“欧洲军”计划而深为美国人赏识的普利文则任国防部长的要职。
    内阁虽然勉强组成了，摆在比内政府面前的却是进一步加深的财政危机和政治危机。越南殖民战争和扩充军备的巨额开支，造成愈来愈大的赤字。据现有估计，法国一九五二年度的预算赤字实际上要达到一万五千亿法郎，占预算总额三分之一以上。据法兰西银行六日公布，法国通货发行额已高达一万八千八百多亿法郎，这较年初时又增加了将近三百亿。同时，黄金美元储备又在迅速枯竭。连比内自己都承认：“法国现在正接近灾难的边缘”，“没有钱，没有税可收”，而且“政府也没有稳定的前途”。因此，在法国国民议会勉强通过了比内的政府名单后，合众社就发出不吉利的预言：“比内在任不会长久。”
