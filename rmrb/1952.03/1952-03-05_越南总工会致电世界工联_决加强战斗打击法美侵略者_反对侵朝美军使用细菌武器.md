Xinhua News Agency, March 4th: The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor sent a telegram to the World Federation of Trade Unions Council, expressing its determination to strengthen its combat forces and oppose the crimes of American aggressors in conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea. The telegram is as follows:

To the World Federation of Trade Unions Council:

I, on behalf of all the workers and laborers of Vietnam, express my extreme anger at the most barbaric act of the American imperialist aggressors in using bacteriological weapons, a murderous weapon repeatedly protested by all civilized nations, in Korea.

In the face of this inhuman crime by the American imperialists, in order to sever their evil bloodstained hands, and to defend world peace, the Vietnamese workers and laborers will further consolidate their ranks, strengthen the combat forces against the French aggressors and American imperialist interventionists, and closely unite and struggle with the Korean people and the people of the world.
