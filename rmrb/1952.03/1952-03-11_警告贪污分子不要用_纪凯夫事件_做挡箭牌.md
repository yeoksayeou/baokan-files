    Warning to Corrupt Elements: Do Not Use the "Ji Kaifu Incident" as a Shield
    Ji Kaifu
    Since the Central China Bureau of the CPC's decision on handling the embezzlement case of Wuhan No. 2 Municipal Hospital and other documents were published, the masses inside and outside the Party have unanimously supported them. Everyone has further realized the glory, greatness, and correctness of the Chinese Communist Party and has received a profound education. The people's government led by the Chinese Communist Party will never wrong good people and will never condone or favor lawbreakers who dare to violate national laws and Party discipline, but will punish them according to the law.
    Today, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement and the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state property, anti-shoddy workmanship, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence movement are being carried out vigorously throughout the country. The ugly face of the bourgeoisie is fully exposed, and some "seated spies" "sent in" by the bourgeoisie have been purged. Some corrupt elements who have been hit by the bourgeoisie's "sugar-coated bullets" have recognized their sins, thoroughly confessed, and repented. However, there are also a few corrupt elements who refuse to confess, continue to pretend, and persist in their sinful behavior, shamelessly saying that this is a repeat of the "Ji Kaifu incident," using the excuse of "infringement of human rights" to threaten and intimidate the masses. For example, a certain enterprise in Wuhan City fully grasped the materials of a major corrupt element and ordered this major corrupt element to suspend work for self-reflection. However, this major corrupt element tried to play tricks and attempted to deceive the masses, shouting loudly: "I am the second Ji Kaifu!" The leading cadres of this enterprise, seeing through the "tiger's" tricks, sternly refuted him: "We don't have a second Song Ying or Zhou Jifang here!" Their words were stern and righteous, exposing the smoke screen released by the corrupt element using shameless means.
    I warn these corrupt elements: your acts of embezzlement of state and people's property and Ji Kaifu's correct action of loving state and people's property and actively fighting against the embezzler Wang Qing are completely two different things. The fact is very clear: you are taking the "Wang Qing line" of embezzlers—stealing state and people's property, refusing to confess, and instead spreading rumors to deceive the organization and confuse the masses. This set of cunning tricks will never cover up your own sins or hide them from the eyes of the masses. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the masses have been mobilized, and after careful investigation and research, Wang Qing's tricks were finally exposed. He was finally imprisoned and punished by the law.
    I warn these corrupt elements: if you are stubborn, refuse to confess, and are unwilling to repent, you are cutting yourselves off from the people. You will have to eat your own bitter fruit, and you can't blame others.
    I warn these corrupt elements: you should be clear-headed and turn back as soon as possible. The people's government's policies have been clearly explained. Without a thorough confession, there is only a dead end.

    警告贪污分子不要用“纪凯夫事件”做挡箭牌
    纪凯夫
    自中共中央中南局关于处理武汉市立第二医院盗款案的决定等文件公布后，党内外群众一致拥护，大家更进一步认识清楚了中国共产党的光荣、伟大和正确，受到了极深刻的教育；中国共产党领导的人民政府决不冤枉好人，对敢于违犯国法党纪的不法分子，决不姑息、偏袒，要依法惩办。
    今天，全国各地正大张旗鼓地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动和反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动；资产阶级的丑恶面目，暴露无遗，一些资产阶级“派进来”的“坐探”被清洗出去了，被资产阶级“糖衣炮弹”击中的贪污分子，有的已认识到自己的罪恶，彻底坦白，悔过自新，但也还有少数拒不坦白的贪污分子，仍在装腔作势，坚持自己的罪恶行为，大言不惭地说这是“纪凯夫事件”的重演，藉口“侵犯人权”来威胁恫吓群众。如武汉市某企业单位，充分掌握了一个大贪污分子的材料，命令这个大贪污分子停职反省，这个大贪污分子却要耍狡猾手段，企图欺骗群众，大声喊冤：“我是纪凯夫第二啦！”这个企业单位的领导干部，洞悉“老虎”的诡计，予以严厉驳斥：“我们这里没有宋瑛、周季方第二！”词严义正，戳穿了贪污分子用无耻手段所放的烟幕。
    我警告这些贪污分子：你们盗窃国家、人民财产的贪污罪行和纪凯夫爱护国家人民财产积极向盗窃分子王清作斗争的正确行动，完全是两回事。事实很明显：你们走的正是盗窃分子“王清路线”——偷窃国家人民财产，拒不坦白，反而散布谣言，欺骗组织，迷惑群众。这一套狡猾手段，决掩盖不住你们自己的罪恶，隐瞒不住群众的眼睛。在英明的中国共产党的领导下，群众发动起来了，经过周密调查研究之后，王清的鬼把戏终于被戳穿了，终于被关进了牢狱，受到了国法的制裁。
    我警告这些贪污分子：如果你们顽固不化，拒不坦白，不愿意悔过，就是自绝于人民。你们就要自食恶果，怪不得别人。
    我警告这些贪污分子：你们要放明白些，趁早回头，人民政府的政策已经交代得清清楚楚，不彻底坦白，只有绝路一条。
