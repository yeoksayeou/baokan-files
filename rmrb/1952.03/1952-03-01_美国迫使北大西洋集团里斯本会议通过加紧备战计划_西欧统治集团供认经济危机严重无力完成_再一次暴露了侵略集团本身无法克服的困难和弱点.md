Xinhua News Agency, 29th — The ninth meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council was held in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, from the 20th to the 25th. The US imperialism has not learned the lessons it should have from the repeated failures of its aggressive war preparations policy and is still trying to step up the Western European arms expansion and war preparations plan. However, the progress and results of the meeting fully exposed that the prospect of the US imperialism's arms expansion and war preparations plan is still very bleak.
    The Lisbon Conference was a continuation of the North Atlantic Group Council's Ottawa Conference in September and Rome Conference in November of last year. At the Ottawa and Rome conferences, the US attempts to force Western European countries to accept its war preparations plan centered on rearming West Germany were successively defeated. After the Rome Conference, the US exerted pressure on Western European countries from all sides. US military governor of Western Europe, Eisenhower, personally urged the European army negotiations held in Paris. US economic governor of Western Europe, Harriman, single-handedly manipulated the so-called "Temporary Committee" responsible for formulating a plan to step up arms expansion. On February 8, US House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Richards openly threatened Western European countries, saying: "The success or failure of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting in Lisbon may be the key to whether US foreign aid will continue." Subsequently, US Secretary of State Acheson directly exerted pressure on France and Britain at the US, British, and French foreign ministers' meeting in London, demanding that they accept the US plan. During the Lisbon Conference, the US also used various threats and inducements to Western European countries inside and outside the meeting.
    Under such rabid pressure from the US, the Lisbon Conference adopted the so-called "European Army" plan and Harriman's Western European arms expansion plan, which included West German troops. The so-called "European Army" plan is actually a plan to drag West Germany into the North Atlantic Group from the back door to openly rebuild the West German Nazi army. This plan stipulates that West Germany establish twelve divisions of troops to join the so-called "European Army" under the command of North Atlantic Commander-in-Chief Eisenhower; West Germany will be a member of the so-called "European Defense Group," and the "European Defense Group" will "operate within the scope of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The resolutions passed at the meeting nakedly revealed the US's ambitious plan to use Western European countries to engage in new military adventures in Europe.
    However, the Lisbon Conference also once again exposed the insurmountable difficulties and weaknesses of the North Atlantic aggression group itself. Although the meeting passed these paper plans, the US had to take measures to increase pressure, which eloquently proves that the contradictions and struggles within the North Atlantic war group have not only not been alleviated, but have intensified. At the same time, this meeting did not solve the serious difficulties faced in implementing these plans.
    The arms expansion plan passed by the meeting itself revealed that the US's war preparations policy has suffered serious setbacks. The Brussels Conference in December of the year before last stipulated that nearly seventy-five divisions should be established in Western Europe by the end of this year, while at this Lisbon Conference, after several compromises, it was barely passed to establish fifty divisions. Even these fifty divisions, in the words of the Associated Press, are still "highly questionable whether more than thirty divisions can be combat-ready, and the rest of the divisions may just be empty talk."
    More importantly, even to achieve this forcibly revised arms expansion plan, there are enormous difficulties. First of all, the mass movement of Western European people universally opposing the rearmament of West Germany and arms expansion is a major obstacle to the implementation of this arms expansion plan. More than 80% of the people in West Germany have expressed their opposition to rearmament, and the huge scale of the French people's movement against arming West Germany has made the US and French reactionaries extremely anxious and uneasy. In Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands, progressive people have unanimously declared their firm opposition to the "European Army" plan. In major ports such as Genoa in Italy and Oran in North Africa, dockworkers have once again launched strikes to refuse to load and unload US war materials. Throughout Western Europe, the movement against war, demanding reduced burdens, and improving living standards is rising day by day—these are the cold facts placed before the participants of the Lisbon Conference. The resolution passed by the Lisbon Conference to openly arm West Germany and step up arms expansion will undoubtedly further arouse the opposition of the Western European people. Secondly, another insurmountable obstacle to the arms expansion plan is that the economies of Western European countries have fallen into a serious crisis due to arms expansion. French Prime Minister Faure stated at the Lisbon Conference: "France has reached the limit of effort that the French national income can allow." British Prime Minister Churchill also announced in London during the conference that he could not complete the originally scheduled three-year arms expansion plan as scheduled. Harriman admitted in his "Temporary Committee" report that due to the economic plight of Western European countries, it was necessary to revise the originally estimated military budget of the North Atlantic Group, and the 1952 military plan could not be completed. Under this circumstance, the Lisbon Conference's plan to step up arms expansion will further push the economies of Western European countries to the brink of bankruptcy.
    Faced with the danger of economic bankruptcy, the ruling groups of Western European countries, although submissively accepted the US plan, unanimously reached out to the US for money. However, the US, which was already stretched thin due to the huge consumption in Korea, was even unable to solve its share of the arms expansion plan in Western Europe. An Associated Press dispatch from Lisbon on the 25th said: "Officials said that the burden of the United States supplying weapons to these troops (referring to Western European troops) seems to be quite heavy, and if everything in the Far East does not go smoothly, the burden may be overwhelming."
    Under these circumstances of numerous difficulties, despite the US officials' efforts to portray the Lisbon Conference as Acheson's "diplomatic victory," the North Atlantic Group countries' own news agencies have already openly expressed discouragement. The Associated Press called what Acheson got at the meeting a "paper victory" and said: "Although these actions are exciting, many delegates and observers here are still very skeptical whether these plans will be realized." Agence France-Presse said more simply: These "merely set goals, and the methods to achieve these goals remain to be discovered."

    美国迫使北大西洋集团里斯本会议通过加紧备战计划
    西欧统治集团供认经济危机严重无力完成
    再一次暴露了侵略集团本身无法克服的困难和弱点
    【新华社二十九日讯】北大西洋侵略集团理事会第九次会议，已于二十日至二十五日在葡萄牙首都里斯本举行。美帝国主义没有从它的侵略备战政策的一再失败中得到应有的教训，仍竭力加紧推行西欧的扩军备战计划。但会议的进程和结果充分暴露了美帝国主义这个扩军备战计划的前途依然十分黯淡。
    里斯本会议是北大西洋集团理事会去年九月渥太华会议和十一月罗马会议的继续。在渥太华会议及罗马会议上，美国强迫西欧各国接受它以重新武装西德为中心的备战计划的企图相继遭到了失败。在罗马会议以后，美国又自各方面对西欧各国加施压力。美国驻西欧军事总督艾森豪威尔曾亲自督促在巴黎举行的欧洲军谈判。美国驻西欧经济总督哈里曼则一手操纵负责拟定加紧扩军计划的所谓“临时委员会”。美国众院外交委员会主席李查兹在二月八日公然向西欧各国要胁说：“在里斯本举行的北大西洋公约组织会议的成败，可能是美国对外援助是否继续下去的关键。”接着，美国国务卿艾奇逊在美、英、法三国外长伦敦会议上直接对法、英两国施行压力，要它们接受美国的方案。在里斯本会议期间，美国也在会内会外对西欧国家多方威胁利诱。
    在美国施用这样穷凶极恶的压力之下，里斯本会议通过了组织包括西德军队在内的所谓“欧洲军”计划和哈里曼的西欧扩军计划。所谓“欧洲军”计划，实际上就是从后门把西德拖入北大西洋集团以公开重建西德纳粹军队的计划。这个计划规定：西德建立十二师军队加入所谓“欧洲军”，归北大西洋军总司令艾森豪威尔指挥；西德将为所谓“欧洲防御集团”中的成员，而“欧洲防御集团”又“将在北大西洋公约组织的范围内活动”。哈里曼计划则规定在今年年底以前在西欧建立五十师军队，西欧国家在今后三年内要再增加军费十一亿多美元。会议通过的决议赤裸裸地表明了美国企图利用西欧国家在欧洲从事新的军事冒险的野心计划。
    可是，里斯本会议同时也再一次地暴露了北大西洋侵略集团本身无法克服的困难和弱点。会议虽然通过了这些纸上计划，但美国曾不得不采取增加压力的办法，这就雄辩地证明北大西洋战争集团内部的矛盾和斗争不但未曾减轻，而且是加剧了。同时，这次会议丝毫也未能解决执行这些计划所面临的严重困难。
    会议所通过的扩军计划本身就暴露出，美国的备战政策已经遭到了严重的挫折。前年十二月的布鲁塞尔会议曾规定到今年年底要在西欧建立近七十五个师，而在这次里斯本会议上，几经折冲才勉强通过成立五十个师。甚至这五十个师，用合众社的话来说，还是“是否有三十师以上的军队能有作战准备颇成疑问，而其余的师，可能只不过是纸上谈兵而已”。
    更其重要的是，即使要实现这个被迫修正了的扩军计划，也存在着极大的困难。首先，西欧人民普遍反对重新武装西德和扩军备战的群众性运动，是阻止这一扩军计划推行的重大障碍。西德百分之八十以上的人民已表示他们反对重新武装，法国人民反对武装西德运动的浩大规模已使美、法反动派极度焦急不安，在意大利、比利时、荷兰，进步的人民一致宣告他们坚决反对“欧洲军”计划，在意大利的热那亚、北非的阿兰等重要港口，码头工人又再度发动了拒绝起卸美国战争物资的罢工。在整个西欧，反对战争、要求减轻负担和改善生活的运动日益高涨——这些就是摆在里斯本会议参加者面前的冰冷的事实。里斯本会议通过公开武装西德和加紧扩军的决议，无疑将更加激起西欧人民的反对。其次，扩军计划的另一个无法克服的障碍是，西欧各国经济已经因为扩军备战而陷于严重的危机了。法国总理富尔在里斯本会议上声明：“法国已到了法国国民收入所能容许的努力极限。”英国首相邱吉尔也于会议期间在伦敦宣布，无法如期完成原定的三年扩军计划。哈里曼在他的“临时委员会”的报告中承认，由于西欧国家的经济窘况，不得不修正原先估计的北大西洋集团的军备预算，并且一九五二年的军备计划已无法完成。在这种情况下，里斯本会议的加紧扩军的计划，势将进一步把西欧各国经济推向破产的深渊。
    面对着经济破产的危险，西欧各国的统治集团虽然屈从地接受了美国的计划，却一致伸手向美国要钱。可是，早因在朝鲜的巨大消耗而捉襟见肘的美国，甚至无力解决自己在西欧扩军计划中所承担的一份。合众社里斯本二十五日电说：“负责人士说，美国为这些军队（指西欧军队）供应武器的负担似乎是相当重的，如果远东一切都不顺利的话，负担可能不胜其重。”
    在这种困难重重的情况下，尽管美国官方力图把里斯本会议说成是艾奇逊的“外交的胜利”，但是北大西洋集团国家自己的通讯社却已经公开表示泄气。合众社把艾奇逊在会议中所得到的东西称为“纸上的胜利”，并且说道：“虽然这些行动很动人心目，此间许多代表与观察家仍然非常怀疑这些计划是否会兑现。”法新社说得更简洁：这些“只不过是定出了目标，而实现这些目标的方法尚待发现。”
