The treacherous merchant Zhao Hongsheng is the manager of Limin Pharmaceutical Factory, one of the "Four King Kongs" in Beijing's new pharmaceutical industry. Sixteen of the twenty workers in Limin Pharmaceutical Factory are relatives and members of the manager's family. Zhao Hongsheng used this set of kinship ties to severely exploit and oppress the workers. He consistently manufactured substandard fake drugs and created fake trademarks, such as using purple dye to replace "Gentian Violet" (a topical disinfectant) and substituting peanut oil for olive oil. He also had the "skill" of wooing and corrupting cadres, which made him even bolder in manufacturing and selling fake drugs.

In early December of last year, Limin Pharmaceutical Factory undertook two batches of medicines for the Volunteer Army. The workers were overjoyed to receive these orders, wanting to work meticulously and contribute their strength to the Resist America, Aid Korea struggle. Unexpectedly, during the first manufacture of one hundred pounds of "Camphor Spirit," Zhao Hongsheng shamelessly wanted to make a huge profit from the Volunteer Army. He deceived the workers, saying, "Camphor is a foreign product and expensive; borneol is a domestic product, so let's use borneol instead." Pharmaceutical technician Xu Renhe immediately objected, saying, "Camphor and borneol have different medicinal properties and do not meet the pharmacopoeia regulations." Workers Zhao Weiping, Liu Zhengzong, Liu Fengjie, and others protested to the manager, saying, "Who are the Volunteer Army shedding blood for? We resolutely disagree with you deceiving the Volunteer Army! We won't work unless we get camphor!" He then reluctantly used camphor. Another time, when manufacturing five hundred pounds of "Aromatic Tincture" for the Volunteer Army, the pharmacopoeia required the use of nutmeg oil (950,000 yuan per pound). Zhao Hongsheng again told the workers to use alcohol to soak nutmeg fruit (26,000 yuan per catty) as a substitute. He said shamelessly, "Nutmeg oil is also extracted from nutmeg fruit, so doing this can reduce costs." Workers Liu Zhengzong and others firmly opposed it. After a delay of six or seven days, Zhao Hongsheng was forced to agree to use nutmeg oil to make the "Aromatic Tincture." The workers happily said, "By doing this, we are worthy of our most beloved people."

During the anti-bribery struggle, the workers actively reported more than 30 crimes committed by Zhao Hongsheng, such as tax evasion, bribery, and cutting corners. On the evening of February 15th, Limin Pharmaceutical Factory held a struggle session. The workers sharply questioned the treacherous merchant Zhao Hongsheng, "The Volunteer Army is shedding blood on the front lines to protect the safety of our motherland's people. But you want to make fake drugs to sell to the Volunteer Army. Isn't this repaying kindness with enmity and being utterly devoid of conscience?" The treacherous merchant Zhao Hongsheng admitted his past crimes on the spot and repeatedly said, "I deserve to die! I am a beast."

    工人们制止了奸商赵鸿升暗害志愿军的阴谋
    董善元
    奸商赵鸿升是利民药厂的经理，是北京市新药业中“四大金刚”之一。利民药厂二十个工人，就有十六个是经理的亲属和本家。赵鸿升就利用这一套亲属关系，严重地剥削和压迫工人。他一贯制造不合规格的假药，并且制造假商标，比如用紫颜色来代替“龙胆紫”（外涂消毒剂），把花生油充当橄榄油。他还有拉拢和腐蚀干部的“本领”，这样他就更加明目张胆地制造和售卖假药。
    去年十二月初，利民药厂承做了两次志愿军用的药品。工人们欢欣鼓舞地迎接这批定货，他们要精工细作，在抗美援朝斗争中贡献自己的力量。不料在第一次制造一百磅“樟脑醑”时，赵鸿升无耻地想从志愿军身上捞一笔暴利。他欺骗工人说：“樟脑是外国货，价钱贵；潮脑是国货，咱们就用潮脑代替吧。”制药技工许人和立即反对说：“樟脑和潮脑药性不同，不符药典规定。”工人赵为平、刘政宗、刘凤捷等都纷纷向经理提出抗议说：“志愿军流血是为了谁？你干欺骗志愿军的事我们坚决不答应！不弄到樟脑我们都不做活！”他这才无可奈何地使用了樟脑。另一次为志愿军承制五百磅“芳香?醑”，按药典规定必须使用肉豆蔻油（每磅九十五万元）。赵鸿升又叫工人用火酒浸肉豆蔻果（每斤二万六千元）来代替。他无耻地说：“肉豆蔻油也是肉豆蔻果里提炼出来的，咱们这样做可以减低成本。”工人刘政宗等坚决反对。拖延了六七天，赵鸿升才被迫答应用肉豆蔻油制成“芳香?醑”。工人们高兴地说：“我们这样做，才对得起我们最可爱的人。”
    在反行贿斗争中，工人们积极地检举了赵鸿升偷税、行贿、偷工减料等罪行三十多件。二月十五日晚上，利民药厂开了斗争会。工人们尖锐地质问奸商赵鸿升：“志愿军在前线流血，为的是保卫我们祖国人民的安全。你却想制假药卖给志愿军，你这不是恩将仇报，丧尽天良了吗？”奸商赵鸿升当场承认了过去的罪恶行为，并连声说：“我该死！我是畜牲。”
