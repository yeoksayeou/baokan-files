    Regulations on the Establishment of People's Courts in the Five-Anti Movement
    (Passed by the 129th Political Affairs Council Meeting of the Government Administration Council on March 21, 1952)
    In order to seriously, cautiously, and timely handle cases of serious and complete violations of laws and regulations by industrial and commercial enterprises and other cases that should be handled through judicial procedures in the Five-Anti Movement, and in order to ensure the smooth and complete conclusion of the Five-Anti Movement, it is necessary to establish People's Courts in cities with a large number of cases of illegal activities by industrial and commercial enterprises. For this purpose, the following principles are hereby stipulated:
    1.  Cities with a large number of cases of illegal activities by industrial and commercial enterprises in the Five-Anti Movement may establish Municipal People's Courts under the leadership of the Municipal People's Government to conduct trials, and may establish branch courts by unit of one district or several districts.

    Cities and counties with fewer cases of illegal activities by industrial and commercial enterprises in the Five-Anti Movement may have such cases tried by the Municipal or County People's Courts, without establishing separate People's Courts. However, when conducting trials, representatives of people's organizations, especially representatives of workers, shop assistants, law-abiding industrial and commercial enterprises, and basically law-abiding industrial and commercial enterprises, should be included as jurors.
    2.  Each Municipal People's Court and its branch courts shall establish a trial committee, composed of one chief judge, one or two deputy chief judges, and several judges.

    The chief judge, deputy chief judges, and judges of the Municipal People's Court and its branch courts shall be appointed by the Municipal People's Government. The chief judge of the Municipal People's Court shall generally be concurrently held by the president of the Municipal People's Court; the deputy chief judges and judges may be appointed from responsible persons of relevant organs and people's organizations, and active elements in the Five-Anti Movement.
    3.  The Municipal People's Court (or the Municipal or County People's Court) has the power to arrest and sentence offenders to return illegal gains, compensate for losses, pay fines, confiscate property, deprive political rights, impose control, undergo labor reform, serve fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment, the death penalty, and may grant probation or exemption from punishment as appropriate.

    Branch courts of the Municipal People's Court generally only handle cases of seriously illegal households, and have the power to order the return of illegal gains, compensation for losses, payment of fines, or exemption from punishment.
    4.  The judgment of the Municipal People's Court (or the Municipal or County People's Court) is the final judgment. However, judgments of life imprisonment and fixed-term imprisonment of ten years or more shall be approved by the Municipal People's Government (those judged by People's Courts below the municipal level or by Municipal or County People's Courts shall be approved by the Provincial People's Government), and judgments of the death penalty shall be reviewed by the Municipal (Provincial) People's Government and submitted to the Greater Administrative Region People's Government or the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval before execution.

    If the defendant or plaintiff disagrees with the judgment of the branch court of the Municipal People's Court, they may appeal to the Municipal People's Court within three days after the judgment is pronounced.
    5.  The judgments of the Municipal People's Court and its branch courts shall be submitted to the Municipal People's Court for execution.
    6.  The determination and handling of law-abiding households, basically law-abiding households, and half-law-abiding and half-illegal households shall be directly carried out by the thrift and inspection committees of each city and county. If industrial and commercial enterprises disagree with the handling by the thrift and inspection committee, they may request the Municipal People's Court (or the Municipal or County People's Court) to handle it.
    7.  The Municipal People's Court and its branch courts shall be revoked by order of the Municipal People's Government after the Five-Anti Movement is concluded and the task is completed.
    8.  These regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.

    关于五反运动中成立人民法庭的规定
    （一九五二年三月二十一日政务院第一百二十九次政务会议通过）
    为了严肃地、谨慎地和适时地处理五反运动中工商户严重违法和完全违法的案件以及其他应经审判程序处理的案件，为了保障五反运动顺利完满的结束，凡工商户违法案件较多之市，有设立人民法庭之需要。为此，特作原则规定如下：
    一、凡五反运动中工商户违法案件较多之市，得在市人民政府领导下设立市人民法庭进行审判，并得以一个区或几个区为单位，设立分庭。
    五反运动中工商户违法案件较少之市、县，此项案件可由市、县人民法院审判之，不另成立人民法庭。但在进行审判时，应吸收人民团体的代表，特别是工人、店员和守法工商户、基本守法工商户的代表陪审。
    二、市人民法庭及其分庭均设审判委员会，以审判长一人、副审判长一人或二人、审判员若干人组成之。
    市人民法庭及其分庭的审判长、副审判长、审判员，均由市人民政府任命之。市人民法庭的审判长，一般由市人民法院院长兼任之；副审判长和审判员，可就有关机关和人民团体负责人及五反运动中的积极分子中任命之。
    三、市人民法庭（或市、县人民法院）有逮捕并判处退出违法所得、赔偿损失、罚金、没收财产、剥夺政治权利、管制、劳役改造、有期徒刑、无期徒刑、死刑及酌予缓刑或免予处分之权。
    市人民法庭分庭，一般只受理严重违法户案件，有判处退出违法所得、赔偿损失、罚金或免予处分之权。
    四、市人民法庭（或市、县人民法院）之判决，为终审判决。但无期徒刑及十年以上有期徒刑的判决应经市人民政府批准（由省辖市以下人民法庭或市、县人民法院判决者，应经省人民政府批准），死刑的判决，应经市（省）人民政府审核，报请大行政区人民政府或报请中央人民政府政务院批准后执行。
    被告或原告如对于市人民法庭分庭的判决不服时，得于宣判后三日内，向市人民法庭上诉。
    五、市人民法庭及其分庭的判决，均送交市人民法院执行。
    六、关于守法户、基本守法户和半守法半违法户的审定和处理，即由各市、县节约检查委员会直接负责进行之。如工商户对于节约检查委员会之处理不服时，可请求市人民法庭（或市、县人民法院）处理之。
    七、市人民法庭及其分庭于五反运动结束和任务完毕后，由市人民政府以命令撤销之。
    八、本规定自公布之日施行。
