    New Changes in the Thinking of Shop Assistants in Beijing's Private Stores
    By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo
    Through the great "Five-Anti" movement, the vast number of shop assistants in various industries in Beijing have significantly improved their class consciousness. They have clearly distinguished themselves from the bourgeoisie and resolutely stood on the side of the working class. Many ideological problems that had not been resolved in the past have now been initially resolved.
    Through this movement, the vast number of shop assistants clearly realized that they are part of the working class, that the Communist Party is their party, and the People's Government is their government. The Party and the People's Government are their most powerful reliance, and they themselves bear significant responsibility to the Party, the People's Government, and the entire country. Many shop assistants said, "The progress made in these few months is faster than in the three years since liberation"; "Now we are truly the masters. We must act like masters and report the illegal activities of capitalists! We cannot be careless and let them act recklessly." In the past, some capitalists often used "People's Representative" and "Federation of Industry and Commerce Member" as a facade to deceive and threaten shop assistants, holding "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to boast that they "understood" Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and scaring shop assistants by saying, "I often listen to Mayor Peng's reports," and so on. Some even said, "You, the working class, are the leading class. But who leads the working class? If it weren't for me in this shop, you wouldn't be able to do anything." Many shop assistants were intimidated because they were not educated enough. However, after this movement, the shop assistants exposed the tricks of the illegal capitalists. They pointed at the illegal capitalists and said, "How can you be a 'People's Representative' when you do such illegal things?" "Who is undermining the Common Program?" "You lead the workers? By what? By your 'five poisons' ideology?" The illegal capitalists, who used to flaunt their power in front of the shop assistants, now lowered their heads.
    The shop assistants deeply felt that they had not fulfilled their responsibilities as masters in the past and expressed their determination to strictly supervise the capitalists from now on, to make them act in accordance with the Common Program and various policies and decrees of the People's Government, and not to allow them to do anything illegal. They said, "If the capitalists don't take the right path, we will force them onto the right path. We have to do this." A capitalist in the first district engaged in illegal activities again after the People's Government had dealt with his illegal issues. The shop assistants immediately intervened. The capitalist said, "The 'Five-Anti' is over, you can't control me!" Seeing him so stubborn, the shop assistants immediately dragged him to the police station. This kind of situation was rare before the "Five-Anti".
    Is the relationship between shop assistants and bosses the relationship between the working class and the bourgeoisie (that is, the relationship between the exploited and the exploiters), or is it a general relationship of relatives, friends, or apprentices? Before the movement, most shop assistants were not very clear about this issue. Because capitalists often used old relationships such as "relatives," "friends," and "apprentices" to deceive shop assistants, there was even the saying that "the relationship between master and apprentice is like that between father and son." The capitalists "educated" shop assistants by saying, "You have to work hard. Your father and I are friends. Your father entrusted you to me, and I have to discipline you." They threatened those shop assistants and apprentices who were dissatisfied with the illegal exploitation and oppression by firing them. Or they would say, "I am considering your maternal grandfather's feelings. Otherwise, I would have fired you long ago." Therefore, many shop assistants were deceived by the capitalists, dared not resist, and could not openly fight against the capitalists. This situation changed in this movement. Through the tempering of struggle, the shop assistants recognized that the relationship of relatives, friends, and apprentices emphasized by the capitalists was merely a disguise for the relationship of exploitation and being exploited. The shop assistants said, "What master and apprentice? You make money, and we suffer!" "What relatives and friends? Whoever has rice puts it in their own pot!" They said, "Relatives are relatives, reporting is reporting, these are two different things." When the capitalist asked, "What problems do we have in our shop?", they were immediately met with merciless rebuttals from the shop assistants. The shop assistants said, "Don't say 'we, we'! You are the bourgeoisie, and we are the working class. Speak more clearly."
    Along with the resolution of this issue, the issue of "who supports whom" was also resolved. In the past, many shop assistants believed that they came with "a mouth on two shoulders," "eating other people's food and learning business from them. After learning for a few years, they got wages, and there were also year-end gifts. If it weren't for the capitalists, where would they find this job?" So they always thought that "the capitalists supported the shop assistants." The capitalists also often used "I support you" to deceive the shop assistants into working desperately for them. When they "taught" shop assistants, they always said, "Everything you eat and wear is mine, everything under your feet and over your head, nothing is not mine, and I also teach you skills. If you don't work hard, are you worthy of me?" It seemed that without the capitalists, the shop assistants would definitely starve to death. However, the shop assistants recognized this issue in this movement. Shop assistants in many shops said, "If it weren't for the shop assistants running the business for the capitalists' few stinky dollars, they would have been finished long ago!" Shop assistant Yang Zhenrui said, "In the past, the store where I was an apprentice had three bosses, supporting twelve wives, and providing for three sons to study abroad and seven sons to study in middle school. The bosses were often not in the store, and it was us shop assistants who did business and made money for them. However, we could only get one dollar a month in wages. Who supported whom? Isn't this issue very clear?" A shop assistant from Ruifuxiang said, "To tell the truth, the capitalists should look back at their history. Ruifuxiang has developed so much, with Ruifuxiang stores in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Yantai, Jinan, and other places. Isn't it all because we run the business and make money for them? When Beijing was first liberated, the capitalists of Ruifuxiang said, 'Business is not going well, we will completely hand it over to you workers, we don't care anymore.' However, later, with the help of the People's Government and the efforts of the shop assistants, business improved. Later, they made a lot of money again, but what benefits did the workers get? The old shop assistant Huang Shoushan, who has worked for forty-six years, is already sixty-three years old this year and still only gets a salary of two hundred and eighty catties of millet a month." The shop assistants exposed the capitalists' various illegal acts of exploitation of shop assistants. Many shop assistants told the capitalists, "We want to work with you to run this store for the common interests of labor and capital, to implement the Common Program, and to implement the united front policy of our working class and the Communist Party. We now allow you to exist and allow you to earn legal money. However, if you violate policies and laws, we will absolutely not agree!"
    With the development of the movement, the shop assistants have also initially resolved the issue of their future and whom the shop assistants should follow. Should they desperately climb up the road of "boss" and "manager" and seek wealth for themselves, or should they return to the ranks of the working class and follow the working class to the bright road of socialism? In the past, this issue was very difficult to resolve. Because many shop assistants were instilled with the idea of "becoming a boss and getting rich" by their elders when they were young, this idea was deeply rooted. One shop assistant said, "The elders in my family educated me from the time I was studying, telling me to study hard, so that I could learn business in the future, eat and drink well, and become a shopkeeper in the future." When they came to the store, the capitalists also used this kind of thinking to educate the apprentices. They said:
    "You have to work hard, and next year you can get a share." "I am getting old, and in a few years, the manager can only be chosen from among you." "Learn skills well, and when you learn them, you can start your own business and become a boss." Therefore, many shop assistants often dreamed of "getting rich" and "becoming a boss." In order to achieve this goal, they worked hard for the capitalists.
    Now, the shop assistants have awakened, and they have exposed the bourgeoisie's deceptive tricks. One shop assistant said: The boss allowed me to have shares; but he never gave me any money. Every time at the end of the year, when the accounts were settled, the capitalist always said: "Business is good this year, but we didn't make any money. Everyone work hard, and we will definitely share the money next year." But the same thing happened the next year. Huang Shoushan, an old shop assistant at Ruifuxiang, said: "How many shop assistants have become managers or assistant managers? The managers and assistant managers are all those capitalists? Their ancestors have been managers for generations! Take me, Lao Huang, for example. I have been selling my life to the capitalists since I was seventeen years old, for forty-six years. My hair and beard have turned white, and the managers have changed a lot, all of them capitalists, and I still only earn two hundred catties of millet a month." Many shop assistants, because they recognized the capitalists' deceptive tricks, withdrew their shares one after another and stood on the side of the working class. They said: "We don't want to be capitalists who don't work for a living. We want to go through New Democracy and move towards a socialist society. In the past, the capitalists smeared our butts with stinky dog ​​poop (referring to shares), and now we want to wash it clean."
    After this movement, many shop assistants are determined to abandon the "business experience" they learned from the capitalists in the past and establish new business ethics. In the past, learning business meant learning from the capitalists how to deceive customers in order to get rich. In the past, there was a popular saying in stores: "Killing someone requires paying with your life, but deceiving someone doesn't require paying with your life." The capitalists "educated" the shop assistants, telling them to "say different things to different people," to use lies such as "genuine goods at fair prices," "one price for all," and "no deception for children or the elderly" to deceive people, to say that cloth that fades is "guaranteed not to fade," to replace a miscellaneous brand with a genuine brand label, to sell fake goods as real goods, and to sell old goods as new goods. If the shop assistants did not act according to the capitalists' wishes, the capitalists would say that the shop assistants "wear black clothes, wear black hats, eat whoever they are facing, how can you be eating inside and out?" "You are not promising, you can't learn anything, just pack your bags and get out." How can one be considered to have learned well? There is one standard, that is, being able to come up with various ways to deceive, and sell fake goods and bad goods at high prices. This kind of "business experience" is also deeply rooted. In last year's patriotic education movement, various industries formulated patriotic conventions, proposing to establish new business ethics, and huge slogans were posted on the doors: "Reduce costs, serve the people," "Small profits and quick turnover," and so on. However, deception was still deception, and nothing changed. This time is different: many shop assistants automatically held meetings to discuss this issue, proposing to completely overthrow the old system and establish a new method of operating private stores. Many pharmacy shop assistants proposed: "The fake and counterfeit medicines sold in the past should all be eliminated." One pharmacy has now stopped selling forty kinds of medicines. The pills that were made with shoddy workmanship were destroyed and remade according to accurate prescriptions with sufficient medicinal materials. Some cloth shops also reduced the prices of cloths with exorbitant profits under the supervision of the shop assistants. For example, "Paramount" rainproof cloth was reduced from 13,000 yuan per foot to 8,200 yuan, and velvet was reduced from more than 50,000 yuan per yard to more than 30,000 yuan.
    The shop assistants proposed: "Now we cannot act according to the capitalists' illegal ideas of engaging in the 'five poisons,' we must be responsible to the people." "We must completely eliminate the methods of attracting customers by 'deceiving people' and 'saying different things to different people' in the past, and we must gain the people's trust with 'credibility' and 'being responsible to the people.'" Shop assistants generally believe that the establishment of new business ethics will make commerce more developed.
    The class consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm of the vast number of shop assistants have been improved, but not all problems have been resolved. In particular, a part of the shop assistants in small and medium-sized stores did not receive enough education in the "Five-Anti" struggle. Although their awareness has been improved, it has not reached the level it should have reached. Some confused ideas still exist. The resolution of these problems depends on the trade union and the People's Government continuing to conduct in-depth and patient education for them. The transformation of the old work styles and bad habits in stores is a long-term struggle process. The current "Five-Anti" movement only provides an important condition for realizing a complete transformation.

    北京市私营商店店员思想的新变化
    本报记者  朱波
    经过伟大的“五反”运动，北京市各行业的广大店员群众，阶级觉悟有了显著的提高，他们明确地和资产阶级划清了界限，坚决地站到工人阶级立场上来了。过去很多没有解决的思想问题，现在初步解决了。
    经过这次运动，广大店员明确地认识了自己是工人阶级。认识了共产党是自己的党，人民政府是自己的政府。党和人民政府是自己最有力的依靠，自己也对党和人民政府以至整个国家负有重大的责任。许多店员说：“解放了三年，不如这几个月进步得快”；“现在我们真正是主人了。我们要拿出主人的身份来，检举资本家的违法行为！不能马马虎虎，由他们胡作非为。”在过去，有些资本家常以
    “人民代表”、“工商联委员”作为招牌来欺骗、威胁店员；拿着“毛泽东选集”来吹嘘他们“懂得”马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想；用“常听彭市长的报告”等等来吓唬店员。有的甚至说：“你们工人阶级是领导阶级，谁领导工人阶级呢？我们柜上如果没有我，你们什么事情也做不了。”许多店员因为受教育不够，就被吓唬住了。但是，经过这次运动，店员们把违法资本家的这套鬼把戏揭穿了。他们指着违法资本家说：“你作这样犯法的事，还算什么‘人民代表’？”“破坏共同纲领的是谁？”“你领导工人，你凭什么？靠你们的‘五毒’思想吗？”以前在店员面前耀武扬威的违法资本家，现在低下了脑袋。
    店员们深深地感觉到自己过去没有尽到主人翁的责任，表示从今天起，一定要严格地监督资本家，要他们按照共同纲领和人民政府的各种政策法令办事，一件违法的事都不能允许他们做。他们说：“资本家如果再不走正路，我们要强迫他们往正路上走。不这样就不行。”第一区有一个资本家，在人民政府处理了他的违法问题以后，他又干违法的事。店员们马上实行干涉。资本家说：“‘五反’已经过去了，你们管不着我！”店员们见他这样顽固，马上就把他扭送到派出所。这种情形，在“五反”以前是不多见的。
    店员和老板，是工人阶级和资产阶级的关系（也就是被剥削者和剥削者的关系）呢？还是一般的亲戚、朋友、师徒关系呢？在运动以前，一般店员对这个问题认识得很不清楚。因为资本家常常用“亲戚”、“朋友”、“师徒”等旧的关系来欺骗店员，甚至有所谓“师徒如父子”的说法。资本家“教育”店员说：“你要好好干，我和你父亲是朋友，你父亲把你交给我，我要管教你。”对那些不满意资本家非法剥削和压迫的店员学徒，则以开除来威胁。或者说：“我是看你外祖父的情面。要不，早开除你了。”因此，很多店员受了资本家的蒙蔽，不敢反抗，不能和资本家撕开脸斗争。在这次运动中，这种情况改变了。经过斗争的锻炼，店员们认识了资本家所强调的亲友师徒关系，乃是剥削和被剥削关系的外衣。店员说：“什么师父徒弟？你赚钱，我们受穷！”“什么亲戚、朋友，谁有米往谁锅里下！”他们说：“亲戚归亲戚，检举归检举，这是两回事。”资本家提出“咱们柜上有些什么问题”时，马上就遭到店员们无情的驳斥。店员说：“不要‘咱们、咱们’的！你是资产阶级，我们是工人阶级，说话要清楚一些。”
    随着这一问题的解决，“谁养活谁”的问题也解决了。过去，很多店员认为，自己是“两肩扛着一张嘴”来的，“吃着人家的饭，跟人家学生意。学了几年以后，有了工资，年终还有馈送。如果没有资本家，这个饭碗那里去找？”所以他们一直认为是“资本家养活着店员”。资本家也常常以“我养活着你们”来蒙蔽店员为他拚命“拉磨”。他们“教训”店员时，总是说：“你吃的穿的都是我的，脚踏的，头顶的，没有一样不是我的，我还教给你本领。如果不好好干，对得起我吗？”好像如果没有资本家，店员就一定要饿死的一样。但是，店员们在这次运动中认识了这个问题。很多商店的店员说：“资本家那几个臭钱，如果不是店员给他经营，早完了！”店员杨镇瑞说：“我过去学生意的那个字号，有三个老板，养着十二个老婆，供给三个儿子在外国念书，七个儿子在中学念书。老板们经常不在柜上，就是我们几个店员给他们做生意，赚钱。但是，我们每月只能拿到一块钱的工资。到底谁养活谁？这问题不是很明白吗？”瑞蚨祥的一个店员说：“叫资本家说良心话，翻一翻老底子，瑞蚨祥发展得这么大，北京、天津、青岛、上海、烟台、济南等地都有瑞蚨祥的字号，还不是我们给他经营赚来的？北京刚解放时，瑞蚨祥的资方说：‘买卖是不行了，完全交给你们工人吧，我们不管了。’但是，后来经过人民政府的扶助和店员的努力，生意好转了。后来又赚钱很多了，可是工人得到了什么好处呢？一连干了四十六年的老店员黄寿山，今年已经六十三岁，还是一个月二百八十斤小米的工资。”店员们揭露了资本家各种非法剥削店员的行为。许多店员这样告诉资本家：“我们要和你们合力经营这个商店，是为了劳资双方的共同利益，为了执行共同纲领，执行我们工人阶级和共产党的统一战线政策。我们现在允许你们存在，允许你们赚合法的钱。但是，你们要违反政策法令，我们就绝对不答应！”
    随着运动的发展，店员们对自己的前途问题，店员应该跟着谁走的问题，也初步解决了。是沿着“老板”、“经理”的道路拚命往上爬，自求发财呢？还是回到工人阶级队伍里来，随着工人阶级走向社会主义的光明大道呢？在过去，这个问题曾经是很不容易解决的。因为很多店员在年幼时就被家里老人灌输了“当老板、发财”的思想，这种思想是根深柢固的。一个店员说：“家里老人们从我读书时就教育我，要我好好读书，以后好去学生意，吃香的，喝辣的，以后还要当掌柜的。”来到商店里，资本家也用这种思想教育学徒。他们说：
    “你要好好干，明年可以给你算上一股。”“我年纪大了，再等几年，经理只能是从你们几个人当中选。”“好好学本领，学成了就可以重立字号当老板。”因此，很多店员经常做着“发财”、“当老板”的梦。为了达到这个目的，他们辛勤地给资本家工作。
    现在，店员们醒过来了，他们揭穿了资产阶级的骗人把戏。有一个店员这样说：东家允许给我股份；但是从来没有给我分过钱。每次年终结账时，资本家总是说：“今年生意不错，就是没有赚了钱。伙计们好好干，明年一定分钱。”可是到了明年，还是这一套。瑞蚨祥老店员黄寿山说：“店员当了经理、协理的有几个？当经理、协理的，还不都是那些资本家？他们祖祖辈辈都是经理！就说我老黄吧，从十七岁给资本家卖命，卖了四十六年了，头发、胡须都白了，经理换了好多，都是资本家，我自己还是一个月挣二百多斤小米。”许多店员因为认识了资本家骗人的把戏，纷纷退股，站到工人阶级立场上来。他们说：“我们不想当那不劳而食的资本家了，我们要经过新民主主义，走到社会主义社会去。过去我们屁股上被资本家涂上了臭狗屎
    （指股份），现在我们要洗干净。”
    经过这次运动，很多店员决心抛弃过去向资本家学来的一套“生意经”，树立新的商业道德。过去所谓学生意，就是向资本家学习如何欺骗顾主，达到发财的目的。过去商店中流行着一句话：“杀死人偿命，哄死人不偿命。”资本家“教育”店员，要他们“见什么人说什么话”、要他们用“货真价廉”、“言不二价”、“童叟无欺”的鬼话来骗人，把落颜色的布说成“保证不落色”，把杂牌货换一个正牌的商标出卖，把假的当成真的出卖，把旧货当成新货出卖。店员如果不按资本家的意思行事，资本家就说店员“穿黑衣，戴黑帽，吃谁向谁，怎么你吃里扒外”？“你这个人没有出息，学也学不出什么来，干脆给我卷铺盖滚蛋”。怎样才算学成了呢？有一个标准，那就是能够想出各种欺骗的办法，用假货、坏货卖得高价。这种“生意经”，也是根深柢固的。在去年的爱国主义教育运动中，各行业曾订了爱国公约，提出要建立新的商业道德，门上也贴了巨幅的标语：“减低成本，为人民服务”，“薄利广销”等等。但是，欺骗还是欺骗，并没有任何改变。这一次却不同了：很多店员自动开会讨论这个问题，提出要彻底打倒旧的一套，建立一套新的私营商店经营的方法。很多药庄店员提出：“过去卖的假药、冒牌药，都应该取消。”有一个药庄，有四十种药品现在已经停止出卖了。偷工减料的药丸被销毁了，重新按确实的药方，加足药料来制作。有的布店也在店员监督下，把有暴利的布的价格减低下来。如“派拉蒙”防雨布，从每尺一万三千元减到八千二百元，丝绒由每码五万多元减到三万多元。
    店员们提出：“现在我们不能按照资本家搞‘五毒’的违法思想办事，我们要对人民负责。”“把过去用‘哄人’、‘见什么人说什么话’来拉拢主顾的方法全部取消，要以‘信用’‘对人民负责’来取得人民对我们的信任。”店员们普遍地认为：新的商业道德的建立，会使商业更趋发达。
    广大店员的阶级觉悟和爱国热情提高了，但并不是所有的问题都已得到解决。特别是中小商店的一部分店员，在“五反”斗争中所受的教育还是很不够的。他们的觉悟虽有提高，但还没有达到应有的程度。若干糊涂观念还存在着。这些问题的解决，有赖于工会和人民政府继续对他们进行深入的耐心的教育。商店里的旧作风和陋习的改造，更是长期的斗争过程。目前的“五反”运动，只是提供了实行彻底转变的一个重要条件罢了。
