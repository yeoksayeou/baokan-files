    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th: A delayed dispatch from Tokyo reports that the Japan-China Friendship Association held an activist meeting on January 23rd, with approximately 30 participants, including representatives from labor unions, small and medium-sized industrial circles, students, and the General Association of Overseas Chinese.

    The representatives at the meeting exchanged experiences on promoting the Sino-Japanese friendship movement and decided to expand this movement into a broad mass movement.

    The meeting heatedly discussed the issue of promoting Sino-Japanese trade. Representatives from small and medium-sized industrial circles spoke one after another, demanding the rapid restoration of Sino-Japanese trade. A representative from the small and medium-sized industrial sector in Tokyo's Arakawa ward said: Due to the ban on trade with China, small and medium-sized industries in the Arakawa ward, which have always relied on exports to China and other countries, are now unable to sustain themselves.

    The meeting finally decided that the Japan-China Friendship Association would cooperate with other organizations to jointly hold a Chinese commodity exhibition, and decided to introduce new Chinese songs, show slides, and further popularize the publications of the Japan-China Friendship Association, vigorously promoting the mass Sino-Japanese friendship movement.

    会议热烈地讨论了促进中日贸易问题，中小工业界的代表纷纷在会上发言，要求迅速恢复中日贸易。东京荒川区中小工业界的一位代表说：由于禁止对中国贸易，一向依靠对中国和其他国家输出的荒川区中小工业，现在都无法维持了。
    会议最后决定由日中友协与其他团体合作，联合举办中国商品展览会，并决定介绍新中国歌曲，放映幻灯和进一步普及日中友协的出版物，大力推进群众性的日中友好运动。
