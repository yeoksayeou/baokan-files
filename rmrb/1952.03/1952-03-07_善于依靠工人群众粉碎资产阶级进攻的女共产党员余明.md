A case of Zhu Lide, an illegal capitalist of the private Qixin Yarn Factory in Shanghai, systematically stealing national superior-grade cotton while acting as a substitute spinner for the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's East China Branch, was exposed after Yu Ming, a female Communist Party member, mobilized the factory's employees to conduct careful investigation and research. Yu Ming is an organizer of the Changning District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanghai and used to be a female worker in a cigarette factory. In July of last year, she was sent to the private Qixin Yarn Factory to assist the factory's Party building and production work. At that time, most of the factory's production was substitute spinning for the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company. After she arrived at the factory, because she was good at approaching the masses and caring about production, she quickly discovered a common complaint among the factory's female workers—the yarn breakage rate was more than double the normal rate, and the work was heavy. In order to be busy with splicing the yarn, female workers sometimes could not even find the time to go to the toilet. Because the female workers did not understand the reason for the high breakage rate, they complained about the maintenance workers; the maintenance workers complained about the cleaning workers, which led to low production morale. Last year, when the factory wanted to launch the signing of a patriotic pact, the female workers were afraid to sign it because the work was difficult, fearing that they would not be able to complete the task. Yu Ming used to be a worker in a cigarette factory and was not familiar with the production of yarn factories, so she could not figure out the reason for the particularly high yarn breakage rate for a while. At that time, the factory's acting manager Zhu Lide wooed a group of employees, asking them to deceive the workers by saying that the high breakage rate was because the cleaning work was not done well and the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's cotton allocation was not good, attempting to undermine the workers' unity and the prestige of state-owned enterprises. In front of Yu Ming, the illegal manufacturer Zhu Lide played another set of tricks. At the labor-capital consultation meeting, he pretended to be attentive and asked Yu Ming to express her opinions, and often said in a progressive tone at the meeting: "To do a good job in production, we rely entirely on the working class!" After the meeting, he said to Yu Ming: "There are no confidants in my factory, I have to rely on the Communist Party, I have to rely on you!" He also said: "I really want to do a good job in production, because I know that China will definitely embark on socialism in the future. I asked my son to study engineering, but he insisted on studying commerce!" This illegal capitalist thought that in this way, on the one hand, he could complicate the problem, and on the other hand, he could flatter Yu Ming to paralyze her.

    But this was a dream.

    Female Communist Party member Yu Ming often remembers Chairman Mao's instruction: to be vigilant at all times against the bourgeoisie's flattery and to strictly prevent the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets from invading. Coupled with her life experience as a worker, she had long been aware of the capitalist's two-faced tricks and the corrupt nature of their obsession with profit. Therefore, she was not deceived by Zhu Lide's sweet words. She knew that as long as she relied closely on the masses of workers, even if she did not understand the technology, the problem could still be clarified. She remembered that a worker had once told her that Zhu Lide had been in the flower business, so she thought that the problem might lie in the raw cotton. She planned how to discover the secret. At first, she went to consult with the factory's trade union cadres, but they could not explain the reason for the high breakage rate either. She went to check the factory's work daily report (a form recording the factory's production situation), but she could not understand it because she did not understand the technology, and she could not get answers from the workers either. However, Yu Ming was not discouraged by this, and the determination to fight against the illegal capitalist encouraged her. She conducted meticulous education for the employees and finally promoted the trade union to hold a working conference, in which activists from various workshops and work staff participated. At the meeting, everyone exchanged production information from various workshops, and found that in addition to the high breakage rate, there was also a serious situation in which the bad yarn with uneven thickness in the spun fine yarn reached more than 30% (the spun yarn was handed over to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company). When discussing and analyzing the reasons for these things, some staff said that the equipment was not good, others said that the maintenance work method was problematic, the work method of the female spinning workers was not good, and the sliver was uneven, and no consistent conclusion could be reached. Finally, everyone agreed to do a trial spin for detailed inspection. When trial spinning was carried out under strict supervision, the situation changed immediately, and the breakage rate per thousand spindles decreased sharply from about 600 times to about 250 times. Yu Ming and other employees carefully inspected and found that the yarn tubes of the trial spinning were smooth and white, while the yarn tubes of the ordinary spinning were not only not smooth but also black in the center, with a lot of flying seeds. This proved that the high breakage rate was due to the poor quality of cotton. Yu Ming felt that her suspicion of Zhu Lide's mischief had a basis. But how much inferior cotton was mixed in the raw cotton, and how much was mixed in the more than one year of substitute spinning? These issues were still unclear. Yu Ming carefully educated the relevant technical staff and notified the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to send people to investigate. As a result, the truth came out. Preliminary statistics show that from June 1950 to October 1951, the illegal manufacturer Zhu Lide stole a total of more than 1,700 dan of national high-quality cotton.

    善于依靠工人群众粉碎资产阶级进攻的女共产党员余明
    上海市私营启新纱厂不法资本家朱立德在替中国花纱布公司华东区公司代纺中，有计划地盗窃国家优级棉，这一案件经女共产党员余明发动该厂职工细心调查研究后揭发出来。余明是中共上海市长宁区委员会的组织员，从前做过烟厂女工。去年七月，她被派到私营启新纱厂帮助该厂的建党和生产工作。当时该厂大部生产是替花纱布公司代纺。她到该厂后，由于善于接近群众，关心生产，很快地发现了该厂女工中普遍叫苦的一件事——纱的断头率超过平常一倍，工作繁重。女工们为了忙于接头，有时连上厕所的时间都抽不出来。女工们由于不了解断头多的原因，便埋怨保全工；保全工埋怨清花工，闹得生产情绪低落。去年该厂要发动签订爱国公约时，女工就因为工作难做不敢订，怕订了完不成任务。余明过去是烟厂工人，对纱厂的生产不熟悉，因此对于纱的断头率特别多的原因一时也摸不清楚。当时该厂代经理朱立德拉拢了一批职员，要他们去欺骗工人说：断头率高是因为清洁工作没做好，花纱布公司配棉不好，企图破坏工人的团结和国营企业的威信。在余明面前，不法厂商朱立德又耍着另一套手段。在劳资协商会上他假装殷勤地请余明发表意见，并常常以进步的口吻在会上说：“要搞好生产，全靠工人阶级！”会后又对余明说：“我厂里没有心腹人，要靠共产党，要靠你！”又说：“我很想搞好生产，因为我知道中国将来一定要走上社会主义，我叫我儿子去学工科，他偏要去学商科！”这个不法资本家满以为这样一方面使问题复杂化，另一方面捧捧场，就可以麻痹余明。
    但这是梦想。
    女共产党员余明经常记起毛主席的指示：要随时警惕资产阶级的捧场，严防资产阶级糖衣炮弹的侵袭。加上她做工人的生活经历，她对资本家的口是心非的花样、唯利是图的腐朽本质早有认识。因此她并没有被朱立德的甜言蜜语所迷惑，她知道只要紧紧地依靠工人群众，虽然自己不懂技术，问题还是可以弄清楚的。她想起有一次工人曾告诉她朱立德曾做过花行生意，这样她就想到问题可能就出在原棉上。她计划着如何去发现其中的秘密。开始，她去找该厂的工会干部商量，他们也说不出断头率多的原因。她去查看厂中的工务日报表（纪录该厂生产情况的表格），由于不懂技术也看不懂，问问工人也问不出来。但是，余明并没有因此灰心，与不法资本家进行斗争的决心鼓舞着她。她向职工们进行了细致的教育，终于推动工会召开了一次工作会议，各车间的积极分子、工务职员都来参加了。会上，大家交换了各车间的生产情况，发现除了断头率高以外，又发现纺成的细纱中粗细不匀的坏纱达百分之三十以上的严重情况（纺出的纱是交给花纱布公司的）。在讨论和分析这些事情的原因时，有的职员说是设备不好，也有人说保全工作法有问题，前纺女工工作法不好，条杆不匀，得不出一致的结论。最后大家同意来一次试纺，以便作详细检查。在严格监督下进行试纺时，情况立刻变了，断头率每千锭时由六百次左右骤减至二百五十次左右。余明和其他职工细心地检验，发现试纺的纱管光滑洁白，而平常纺的纱管不但不光滑并且中心发黑，带有很多飞籽。这证明了断头率高是由于棉花质量差的缘故。余明感到自己对朱立德捣鬼的怀疑有了根据。但是原棉中到底搀进多少劣质棉花，一年多的代纺中一共搀了多少？这些问题还弄不清楚。余明又细心地向有关的技术员工进行教育，并通知花纱布公司派人来调查。结果真相大白了。初步统计，从一九五零年六月至一九五一年十月，不法厂商朱立德共盗窃了国家优质棉一千七百多担。
