Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 29th: At the Korean Armistice Talks' third agenda item staff meeting on the 29th, the other side stubbornly and unreasonably insisted that our side make unilateral concessions on the rotation and port issues, demanding that our side not only agree to their monthly rotation limit of 35,000 people, but also agree to the six specific port figures proposed by the other side for each party. The other side even more absurdly and arrogantly threatened our side to accept their unreasonable opposition to our proposed neutral countries, even at the cost of disrupting the armistice talks. Our side denounced the other side's arrogant and unreasonable threatening attitude, pointing out that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation resolutely rejected any attempt to demand that our side make unilateral concessions on the rotation and port issues, and resolutely rejected any unreasonable opposition in any form to our nominations that fully conformed to the definition of neutral countries. On the rotation and port issues, our side has already put forward a completely reasonable compromise plan of 35,000 people per month and five specific ports per side. On the issue of neutral country nominations, our side has also put forward two fair and reasonable solutions: both sides simultaneously and once express agreement to the other side's nomination; or both sides each nominate three neutral countries without any consent procedures. If the other side genuinely desires progress in the negotiations, they should seriously consider and accept our reasonable proposals. If the other side deliberately delays or even disrupts the armistice talks, they must bear full responsibility.

The fourth agenda item staff meeting, which lasted for twenty-two days, reached an agreement on several non-fundamental issues and the wording of related clauses. However, due to the other side's persistent insistence on its absurd and unreasonable "voluntary repatriation" proposition, the fundamental issue of prisoner of war repatriation principles remained unresolved, becoming the only obstacle to resolving the fourth agenda item. Our side has repeatedly pointed out that no matter at what level of the meeting, if the other side is unwilling to abandon its "voluntary repatriation" proposition, this issue cannot be resolved. Due to the other side's unreasonable insistence on its "voluntary repatriation" proposition, the staff meeting could no longer make progress. Our side agreed to the other side's proposal to return the remaining sole issue to the subcommittee for resolution. The subcommittee, which had been adjourned for twenty-two days, reconvened at 11:00 this morning. Our representative solemnly stated at the meeting:

"Regarding the discussion of the fourth agenda item, up to now, the subcommittee has held fifty-five meetings, and the staff meetings have been held twenty-two times. Although agreements have been reached on various specific issues, and even the wording of the vast majority has been agreed upon, there is still a major obstacle on the road to reaching a complete agreement, which is the fundamental disagreement on the basic issue of prisoner of war repatriation. It not only hinders the progress of the entire armistice talks, but also increasingly increases the anxiety and pain of millions of prisoners of war and those who care about them. On the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, although our side has repeatedly made concessions and made every effort to try to find a satisfactory solution to this issue as soon as possible. However, your side has repeatedly insisted on unreasonable principles, causing the meeting to be delayed until now without reaching a complete agreement. This responsibility should be entirely borne by your side.

Through all kinds of untenable arguments on your side, one thing is very obvious, that is, your side is unwilling to repatriate all of our captured personnel. In order to achieve this sinister attempt, your side has continuously complicated this problem, which is not difficult to solve, and created terms such as 'reclassification' and 'voluntary repatriation' to serve you. These ridiculous propositions have long been thoroughly shattered under our side's stern refutation. Your side knows that it is unreasonable, but still sophists in many ways, stubbornly trying to achieve the purpose of detaining our captured personnel. Checking the past meeting records, it is easy to see how embarrassingly and fruitlessly you have struggled in sophistry for this unseemly attempt. Today, when both of us return to the subcommittee to try to resolve this long-awaited issue, I do not intend to spend much time recounting your unreasonable demands and opinions one by one. Because now is the time for your side to settle some of your untenable absurdities.

You should remember that at the beginning of this fourth agenda item subcommittee, you were always unwilling to talk about the principle of release and repatriation, but advocated that both sides exchange materials first. When our side proposed to exchange materials, you put forward a series of unreasonable proposals such as 'one-to-one exchange,' 'free choice,' 'voluntary repatriation,' and unilateral 'swearing in.' In order to achieve the purpose of detaining our captured personnel, your side did not hesitate to insult the principle of full release and repatriation of prisoners of war, which has long become a universally recognized international practice, calling it 'forced repatriation'; did not hesitate to violate all war regulations, and attempted to illegally 'classify' our captured personnel as civilians; did not hesitate to harm the true free will of the prisoners of war, and interfered with the political beliefs of the prisoners of war. Facts have proved that these things, which serve your sinister purposes, only bring the meeting into endless debate and increasingly expose your true intentions, in addition to earning the condemnation of peace-loving people all over the world.

Our side's proposal of the fair and reasonable principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war, as well as repeated concessions in the subsequent negotiations, proves our impartiality and sincerity. Even your side does not dare to openly oppose the principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war. Your side once mistakenly believed that releasing our captured personnel was equivalent to increasing our military strength. This clearly reveals that what your side really cares about in the issue of prisoner of war repatriation is not the human rights and happiness of the prisoners of war, but the combatants and military force. However, in order to remove the obstacles to solving this problem, our side proposed that both sides guarantee that their captured personnel, after being repatriated, will no longer participate in combat operations in Korea. In this way, a path to progress was opened up for the staff meetings.

Our side's contribution to the fourth agenda item is enormous. Even so, your side's attempt to use the possession of more prisoners of war to detain our captured personnel has not been abandoned due to our side's repeated concessions. It has found a shocking manifestation in action, that is, recently on Geoje Island, your side used rifles, grenades, and tanks to massacre and suppress our captured personnel who had no defensive weapons on a large scale. This bloody atrocity declared to the world the complete bankruptcy of your so-called 'voluntary repatriation.' The blood of those heroic captured personnel of our side showed the world that true free will cannot be insulted by any evil trick. After our side lodged a stern protest to your side, your side shamelessly called this monstrous crime an internal affair. Let me tell you: no matter what methods you use to cover up this inhumane bloody event, you cannot escape the judgment of the people of the world. Now everyone knows that 'free choice' under the muzzle of guns and bayonets is the 'free choice' that your side firmly advocates. Your side's 'individual interviews' and tattooing on prisoners of war are not only ugly dramas that you play for your own appreciation, but also a strong irony of the respect for the personality of the prisoners of war. At the recent staff meeting, your staff said that your side has removed the meaning of 'political choice' in the draft agreement, and there is no 'free choice regarding repatriation.' Your side's position is 'no forced repatriation,' and it is beautifully named 'concession.' Our side believes that this is completely another example of your side playing word games in a comical drama. It is the twin brother of jokes like changing from 'one-to-one' to 'exchange of equal numbers.' This is what our side can never accept.

In order to reach an agreement as soon as possible, I want to remind your side to reconsider your unreasonable position, carefully study and accept our fair and reasonable principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war, so that the principled agreement, which should have been uncontroversial and readily reached, will not be delayed indefinitely."

    朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上
    我痛斥美方狂妄无理的威胁态度
    在第四项议程会议上我驳斥对方一切狡辩
    【新华社开城二十九日电】二十九日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，对方蛮横无理地坚持要我方在轮换和口岸问题上作单方面的让步，要求我方不但同意对方的每月三万五千人的轮换限额，并且同意对方所提出的每方六个特定口岸的数字。对方更荒谬狂妄地要挟我方接受对方对于我方所提出的中立国家的毫无理由的反对，甚至于不惜以破坏停战谈判作为威胁。我方痛斥对方这种狂妄无理的威胁态度，指出朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团断然拒绝任何要求我方在轮换和口岸问题上作单方面让步的企图，断然拒绝在任何形式下对于我方完全合乎中立国定义的提名的毫无理由的反对。我方在轮换和口岸问题上，已经提出了每月三万五千人和每方五个特定口岸的完全合理的折衷方案。我方在中立国提名问题上也已提出两种公平合理的解决方案：双方同时并一次对另一方的提名表示同意；或双方各自提名三个中立国家而不进行任何同意手续。如果对方确实愿望谈判能有所进展，就应该郑重考虑并接受我方各项合理方案。如果对方蓄意拖延甚至于破坏停战谈判，对方必须担负全部的责任。
    开了二十二天会的第四项议程参谋会议，虽对若干并非基本的问题及其有关条款的措辞达成了协议，但是由于对方始终坚持其荒谬无理的“自愿遣返”主张，战俘遣返原则这一基本问题仍然未能获得解决，成为解决第四项议程的唯一障碍。我方曾经再三指出不论在什么一级的会议上，如果对方一天不愿放弃其“自愿遣返”的主张，这个问题就一天不能解决。由于对方无理坚持其“自愿遣返”主张，使参谋会议不能再有所进展。我方同意了对方的提议，将剩下的这个唯一问题交还给小组委员会去解决。休会了二十二天的小组委员会在今早十一时复会。我方代表在会上郑重表示：
    “关于第四项议程的讨论，进行到现在为止，小组委员会已开了五十五次，参谋人员会议开过二十二次。虽然在各项具体问题上已达到协议，甚至绝大部分连文字方面都已达成协议，但是在达到完全协议的道路上仍旧存在着极大的障碍，这就是在基本的战俘遣返问题上，尚存在着原则的分歧。它不但阻碍了整个停战谈判的进展，而且日益增加着千千万万战俘们和关心他们的人们的焦虑与痛苦。在战俘遣返问题上，虽然我方曾一再让步，竭尽一切努力从事各种尝试，以觅致早日获得这一问题的圆满解决。但是，你方却一再坚持无理的原则，使会议拖延至今尚未能达成完全协议。这个责任是应该完全由你方来负的。
    贯穿着你方形形色色的站不住的论点，有一件事是非常明显的，那就是你方不愿意将我方被俘人员全部遣返。为了达到这一阴险的企图，你方曾连续不断地在使这不难解决的问题复杂化，制造了像‘重新分类’、‘自愿遣返’等等名词，来为你们服务。这些可笑的主张，在我方严正驳斥下，早已彻底粉碎了。你方自知理屈，但仍多方狡辩，顽固地企图实现扣留我方被俘人员的目的。检查一下过去的会议记录，就可以很容易看到，为了这种不敢见人的企图，你们曾经多么狼狈地无益地在诡辩中挣扎。在今天我们双方重新回到小组委员会上来试图解决这久待解决的问题的时候，我不打算费许多的时间来一一追述你方无理的要求和意见。因为现在是你方应该清算你方站不住的一些怪论的时刻。
    你们应该记得在这第四项议程的小组委员会开始的初期，你始终不愿谈释放和遣返的原则问题，而主张双方先交换材料，及至我方提出交换材料后，你方却提出了一连串的无理的‘一对一交换’、‘自由选择’、‘自愿遣返’以及片面的‘宣誓’等等荒谬的主张。为了达到扣留我方被俘人员的目的，你方不惜把早已成为举世公认的国际惯例的全部释放并遣返战俘的原则横加污辱，称之为‘强迫遣返’；不惜违反一切战争法规，企图将我方被俘人员非法‘分类’为平民；不惜戕害战俘们的真正自由的意志，干预战俘们的政治信仰。事实证明，这一些为了你方毒辣的目的而服务的东西，除了使会议拖入绝无止境的争论和日益暴露你方的真正存心以外，便只有博得全世界爱好和平人民的谴责。
    我方的释放并遣返全部战俘的公平合理的原则的提出，以及随后在谈判中一再的让步，证明了我方的公正与诚意，甚至你方也不敢公然提出反对释放并遣返全部战俘的原则。你方曾错误地认为释放了我方被俘人员就等于增加了我方军事力量。这显然透露了你方在战俘遣返问题上，真正关心的并不是战俘们的人权与幸福，而是战斗人员与武力。但是我方为了扫除解决这一问题的障碍，提出了双方保证其被俘人员被遣返后，不再参加在朝鲜的冲突中的战斗行动。这样，才给参谋人员会议开辟了进展的道路。
    我方在第四项议程上的贡献是巨大的。虽然如此，你方想利用控有较多的战俘以扣留我方被俘人员的企图，并未因我方一再让步而放弃。它在行动上又找到骇人听闻的表现，这就是最近在巨济岛上，你方用步枪、手榴弹和坦克，大批屠杀和镇压我方没有自卫武器的被俘人员。这一血腥的暴行向全世界宣布了你方所谓‘自愿遣返’的彻底破产。那些英勇的我方被俘人员的鲜血，向全世界昭示了真正的自由意志是不能被任何邪恶的诡计侮辱的。在我方向你方提出严正的抗议以后，你方竟恬不知耻地把这滔天罪行称之为内政事务。告诉你：不论你方用什么方法来掩盖这一灭绝人性的血腥事件，你们也不能逃脱世界人民的裁判。现在人人都知道在枪头和刺刀下的‘自由选择’，就是你方所坚决主张的‘自由选择’。你方的‘个别询问’和在战俘身上刺字不仅是自己扮演供自己欣赏的丑剧，也是对战俘的人格尊重的强烈讽刺。在最近的参谋人员会议上，你方参谋人员说你方在协议草案中已去掉了‘政治选择’的意思，已没有‘关于遣返的自由选择’。你方的立场是‘不得强迫遣返’，并且美其名曰‘让步’。我方认为这完全是你方玩弄文字把戏的又一个滑稽剧的实例。它是由‘一对一’改为‘同等数目的交换’一类笑柄的同胎兄弟。这是我方决不能接受的。
    为了早日达成协议，我要提醒你方应该重新考虑你方不合理的立场，仔细研究并接受我方公平合理的释放并遣返全部战俘的原则，使早已应该没有什么争论而即可达成的原则协议不致再无限期地拖延下去。”
