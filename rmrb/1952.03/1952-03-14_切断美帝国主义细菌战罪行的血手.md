    Sever the Bloody Hand of American Imperialism's Germ Warfare Crimes
    Situ Meitang, Member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission
    The extremely vicious, murderous, and bloodthirsty American imperialism, unwilling to accept its disastrous defeat in the aggression against Korea, has frantically spread large quantities of bacteria on the Korean front and in Northeast China on January 28th and February 29th, continuously, in an attempt to slaughter our people and turn our fertile land into wasteland. This heinous crime, disregarding international law and obliterating humanity, is unprecedented and has naturally aroused unparalleled anger among the people of the world, rapidly forming a global protest movement to condemn the Wall Street warmongers!
    The shameful crime of American imperialism's germ warfare further demonstrates that it wants to unscrupulously sabotage the Korean armistice talks, blatantly expand the war of aggression, and provoke new wars of aggression. It is not only an enemy of the Chinese and Korean people but also an enemy of the peace and justice of all mankind. This does not indicate its "strength," but merely demonstrates that in its desperate struggle at the end of its rope, with its weakened power and declining influence, it is heading towards death more quickly. Beasts that use such vicious methods as bacterial plagues to harm people will certainly not have a good ending.
    In the face of atrocities, we can only deepen our hatred; in the face of aggression, we can only strengthen our fighting will. The Chinese people are issuing accusations against the American aggressors to the world, calling on the peace-loving people of the world to take joint action to sever the aggressors' bloody hands. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's protest statement on March 8th precisely reflects the Chinese people's righteous and unwavering will.
    Victory belongs to the people of justice and peace; the people's court's gallows await that group of barbaric and shameless war criminals.
    American war-profiteer Acheson panicked under the world's unanimous, righteous, and stern condemnation, and tried to deny their crimes, claiming they had not engaged in germ warfare. However, the evil experiments of a group of "bacterial experts" under the command of American aggressor Seyms over the past few years, for which he even received a "medal;" and the fact that Japanese germ warfare criminals such as Shiro Ishii and Jiro Wakamatsu had committed such heinous activities in the occupied areas of China in the past, poisoning countless Chinese people, and that the American headquarters had reared these war criminals to continue "researching" and "experimenting" and manufacturing various bacterial weapons. Today, they are spreading bacteria in large quantities in Korea and China. The ironclad facts are before us, leaving no room for their sophistry. In addition to solemn protests and condemnations, we must also organize ourselves urgently nationwide, heighten our vigilance against the American imperialists' evil plots, and strengthen our work to defend against germ warfare. Returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese should also do their best to accuse the American imperialists of their shocking crime of trying to poison the Chinese people with plague, in order to mobilize world public opinion and fight to defeat the enemy's germ warfare. We also believe that we can completely defeat them. We must not be numb, let alone panic.
    The "Investigation Group on the Crimes of American Imperialism's Germ Warfare" organized by various democratic parties and people's organizations is about to set out. Through on-the-spot investigations, research, and reporting, it will definitely be able to quickly expose all the truth about the crimes of American imperialism to the world, deepen everyone's understanding of the ugly face of the murderous barbarians, and take effective action to stop them from continuing to do evil.

    切断美帝国主义细菌战罪行的血手
    华侨事务委员会委员  司徒美堂
    穷凶极恶杀人成性的美帝国主义不甘心于侵略朝鲜的惨败，竟于一月二十八日和二月二十九日连续不断在朝鲜前线和我国东北等地，疯狂撒布大量细菌，要屠杀我们的人民，要使我们的良田变为荒土，这种不顾国际公法、灭绝人道的滔天罪行，真是史无前例，自然引起了全世界人民的无比愤怒，迅速地形成为世界性的抗议运动，向华尔街战争贩子们一致声讨！
    美帝国主义细菌战的可耻罪行进一步表明：他要肆无忌惮地破坏朝鲜停战谈判，他要明目张胆地扩大侵略战争并挑动新的侵略战争，不特与中朝人民为敌，而且与全人类的和平正义作对，这不是表示他的什么“强大”，仅仅是表示他在日暮途穷、力弱势蹙的绝望挣扎中更快地走向死亡的道路。使用细菌瘟疫这种毒辣方法去害人的野兽，一定没有好收场。
    在暴行面前只有加深我们的愤恨，在侵略面前，只有加强我们的战斗意志，中国人民向全世界发出对美国侵略军的控诉，呼吁全世界和平人民共同行动把侵略者的血手切断。周恩来外交部长三月八日的抗议声明，正是反映了中国人民这种正义凛然不可动摇的意志。
    胜利是属于正义与和平的人民；人民法庭的绞架则等待着那群野蛮无耻的战犯。
    美国战争贩子艾奇逊在全世界一致义正词严的声讨下发慌了，想抵赖他们的罪行，说他们没有进行细菌战，可是几年来如美国侵略军赛姆斯所指挥的一群“细菌专家”的罪恶试验，他还因此而获得了“勋章”；又如日本的细菌战犯石井四郎、若松次郎等往年在中国沦陷区有过这种罪恶活动，毒害过无数的中国人，恰恰是美国侵略总部又把这些战犯豢养起来，继续“研究”“试验”，制造各种细菌武器。今天在朝鲜、中国又大量撒布细菌，铁的事实摆在面前，不容他们的狡赖。我们除了严正抗议声讨以外，还必须全国紧急组织起来，对美帝国主义的罪恶阴谋提高警惕，加强防御细菌战的工作，归国华侨、华侨眷属更要尽力向海外华侨控诉美帝国主义想以瘟疫来毒害中国人民的惊人罪状，为动员世界舆论，打败敌人的细菌战而斗争。我们也相信完全可以把他打败，不能麻木，更不能慌乱。
    各民主党派各人民团体所组织的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”就要开始出动了，经过实地的调查、研究和报道，一定能迅速地将美帝国主义罪行真相全部公之于世，加深大家对杀人生番丑恶面目的认识，以有效行动来制止他们的继续作恶。
