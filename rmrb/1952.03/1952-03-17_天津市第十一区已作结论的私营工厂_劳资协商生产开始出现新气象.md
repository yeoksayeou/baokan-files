In the "Five-Anti" movement, the capitalists of twenty-seven larger textile and dyeing factories in the Eleventh District of Tianjin confessed their illegal activities relatively thoroughly and were treated leniently by the People's Government. Now, the production and operation of these twenty-odd factories have begun to show a new atmosphere. For example, before the "Five-Anti" struggle, the defective product rate of Huiyuan Dyeing Factory was as high as 50%, and now the defective product rate has been reduced to 30%; the output of Beida Dyeing Factory has increased by 14%, and the quality has increased by 7%. In addition, factories such as Yida and Yuyuan have also increased their output and quality. Due to the improvement of product quality and the increase in output of various factories, which can meet the standards stipulated in the contract, the Huasha Cloth Company has continued to sign processing contracts with some factories that have completed the first batch of processing tasks. This has further encouraged the confidence of the capitalists of various factories in striving to operate.

After the liberation of Tianjin, the private textile and dyeing factories in the Eleventh District of Tianjin were supported by the state in many ways, so their production developed rapidly. However, the capitalists of these factories repaid kindness with ingratitude, using various fraudulent means to steal state property totaling more than 29 billion yuan. After the "Five-Anti" struggle began, the capitalists of these factories gradually confessed their theft behaviors under the strict inspection of workers and staff. The Eleventh District Thrift Inspection Branch gave them lenient treatment based on their degree of confession and the opinions of the workers and staff, and made conclusions.

After these factories made their conclusions, the state-owned Huasha Cloth Company entrusted them with processing and dyeing cloth again to support their production. The chairmen of the trade unions and representatives of the workers and staff of various factories also took the initiative to hold temporary labor-capital consultation meetings with the capitalists, explaining the policies of the People's Government to the capitalists, and jointly formulating plans for developing production and implementing democratic reforms with the capitalists. These facts educated the capitalists and moved them deeply. Therefore, they all expressed that they would engage in production in a proper manner under the leadership of the working class in the future. The capitalist of Yuyuan Dyeing Factory said: "In the past, we always lied and cried about losing money because we were afraid that workers would ask us for welfare. Now we admit that this is completely wrong." The factory decided to make the accounts public in the future, establish a sound accounting system, and do a good job in production under the supervision of workers. After the capitalist of Huaguang Dyeing Factory made a conclusion, he decided to take out all the more than 300 million yuan of refunds this time to repair machines and expand production.

The workers of these private factories have also been greatly educated in the "Five-Anti" movement and have strengthened their sense of being the masters of the country. For example, when the Yida Dyeing Factory signed a processing contract with the state-owned Huasha Cloth Company, the workers and staff participated in the review and signed and stamped the contract, conscientiously supervising the capitalist to act in accordance with the contract and not allowing the capitalist to cut corners. Before Huaguang Dyeing Factory signed a processing contract with Huasha Cloth Company, the workers helped the capitalist to carefully calculate the cost, reducing the processing cost of each piece of cloth from 51,000 yuan to 47,000 yuan. The workers and staff of various factories also tried to improve machinery and equipment, improve operating techniques, and save labor and materials.

With the workers and staff working hard and the capitalists willing to actively operate, these private factories that have made conclusions have begun to show a new atmosphere in production and operation. (Xinhua News Agency)

Xinhua News Agency: The workers and staff of seventeen hardware factories, including Zhenhua Wire Factory, in the Eleventh District of Tianjin, which have already made conclusions, recently held temporary labor-capital consultation meetings with the capitalists of each factory to study how to develop production, improve management and administration in the future.

In the temporary labor-capital consultation meetings, both labor and capital in various factories talked about their feelings about the "Five-Anti" movement. The workers unanimously felt deeply that the working class was indeed the master of the house. The workers of Dazhongguang Machinery Factory, who had been illegally abused by the capitalists in the past, said: "After this movement, we feel that we are members of the leading class." The capitalists of various factories unanimously thanked the government for its lenient treatment and expressed that they would do a good job in production in a proper manner under the leadership of the working class in the future.

Improving management and implementing democratic management were the central topics of the temporary labor-capital consultation meetings in various factories. The capitalists of various factories all expressed that they would operate honestly in the future, establish and improve labor-capital consultation meetings, implement cost accounting, make accounts public, make contracts public, make technologies public, and accept the supervision of workers. Wang Zongshan, the manager of Tonghe Iron Factory, stated that he would turn the "Five-Anti" into his "Five No Agreements" - no bribery, no tax evasion, no theft of state property, no cutting corners, and no stealing state economic intelligence. Huang Zhaolin, the manager of Yaguang Electric Appliance Factory, put forward ten guarantees on the spot for the workers and staff to supervise and implement. The labor and capital of Zhenhua Wire Factory jointly studied specific methods to improve management in the future and made a resolution: 1. Improve the labor-capital consultation meeting and hold a meeting every half month; 2. Regularly listen to the opinions of workers and staff through the form of a general meeting of all workers and staff and adopt rationalization proposals; 3. Make the accounts public and report the business situation by the manager every month; 4. Improve the accounting system and establish cost accounting; 5. Make the processing order contract public, with labor and capital each holding a copy; 6. Implement the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital; 7. Add machinery and equipment and modify unreasonable machines; 8. Do a good job in labor protection and improve safety and health facilities; 9. Labor and capital jointly formulate a production plan; 10. Organize a technical research association to improve technology; 11. Strengthen labor discipline. Xu Zhizhou, the manager of the factory, also said at the meeting: In the past, he had issued false invoices and false purchase certificates to raise more than 500 million yuan of funds, and foreign manufacturers owed the factory 800 million yuan of goods. After these two funds are recovered, in addition to ensuring the timely return of the stolen money, he also guaranteed to expand production equipment. The workers and staff of various factories also guaranteed at the meeting to abide by labor discipline and assist the capitalists in doing a good job in production. The workers of Yaguang Electric Appliance Factory put forward four guarantees: 1. Increase output; 2. Improve quality; 3. Complete tasks on schedule; 4. Strengthen the management of goods.

The working conditions of the workers in these private factories are generally very bad. In the past, the capitalists ignored the workers' demands. Now, the managers of various factories have guaranteed to gradually improve the welfare of workers and staff and improve safety and health equipment. Some have decided to accept the opinions of workers and immediately prepare to set up a safety inspection team to start inspecting and improving safety equipment.

    天津市第十一区已作结论的私营工厂
    劳资协商生产开始出现新气象
    天津市第十一区二十七家较大的纺织厂和染整的资方，在“五反”运动中比较彻底地坦白了自己的不法行为，受到人民政府的宽大处理。现在这二十多家工厂的生产经营都开始呈现新气象。例如汇源染厂在“五反”斗争以前，次品率达百分之五十，现在次品率已减少至百分之三十；北大染厂产量提高了百分之十四，质量提高了百分之七；此外如义大、裕源等厂也都提高了产量和质量。由于各厂的产品质量改进，产量提高，能达到合同规定的标准，花纱布公司已继续与某些完成了第一批加工任务的工厂订立加工合同。这就更加鼓舞了各厂资方努力经营的信心。
    天津市十一区的私营纺织、染整各厂，在天津解放后，曾受到国家多方面的扶助，因此生产日益发展。但这些工厂的资方竟以怨报德，使用各种欺诈手段盗窃国家财产共达二百九十亿元以上。“五反”斗争开始以后，这些工厂的资方在工人、职员的严密检查下，逐步交代了自己的盗窃行为。十一区节约检查分会根据他们的坦白程度和职工的审查意见，予以宽大处理，并作出了结论。
    这些工厂在做出结论以后，国营花纱布公司就又委托他们加工染布，支持他们的生产。各厂工会主席和职工代表也主动地和资方举行临时劳资协商会议，向资方解释了人民政府的政策，并和资方共同制订了发展生产和实行民主改革的计划。这些事实教育了资本家，使他们深受感动。因此，他们都表示今后要在工人阶级的领导下规规矩矩地从事生产。裕源染厂资方说：“过去我们总是撒谎，嚷着赔钱，因为怕工人找我们要求福利，现在我们承认这完全是不对的。”该厂决定今后公开账目，建立健全的会计制度，在工人监督下搞好生产。华光染厂厂资方做了结论以后，决定把这次减退的三亿多元全部拿出来修理机器，扩大生产。
    这些私营工厂的工人们在“五反”运动中也受到了很大的教育，加强了国家主人翁的感觉。如义大染厂职工在该厂资方和国营花纱布公司订立加工合同时，参加审查，并在合同上签字盖章，认真地监督资方按照合同行事，不许资方再偷工减料。华光染厂在和花纱布公司订立加工合同前，工人帮助资方精算成本，使每疋布的加工成本由五万一千元降低到四万七千元。各厂职工并设法改良机器设备，改进操作技术，省工省料。
    在职工努力生产，资方愿意积极经营的情况下，这些已做了结论的私营工厂，在生产经营方面就开始出现了新气象。（新华社）
    天津市第十一区已经作了结论的振华电线厂等十七家五金业工厂的职工，日前分别和各该厂资方举行了劳资临时协商会，研究今后如何发展生产，改善经营和管理。
    在劳资临时协商会中，各厂劳资双方都谈了自己对“五反”运动的感想。工人们一致深深感到工人阶级确实当家作主人了。过去受到资方非法虐待的大中光机器厂的工人说：“经过这次运动，咱才感到自己是领导阶级的一分子。”各厂资方一致感谢政府的宽大处理，表示今后要在工人阶级的领导下，规规矩矩地搞好生产。
    改善经营和实行民主管理，是各厂劳资临时协商会的中心议题。各厂资本家都表示今后一定老老实实地经营，建立和健全劳资协商会议，实行成本会计，公开账目，公开合同，公开技术，接受工人的监督。同和铁工厂经理王宗山表明要把“五反”变成自己的“五不公约”——不行贿、不偷税漏税、不盗骗国家资财、不偷工减料、不盗窃国家经济情报。亚光电器厂经理黄兆麟当场提出了十条保证，让职工监督执行。振华电线厂劳资双方共同研究了今后改善经营的具体办法，并作出了决议：一、健全劳资协商会议，每半月开会一次；二、经常通过全体职工大会方式，听取职工意见，采纳合理化建议；三、账目公开，每月由经理报告营业情况；四、健全会计制度，建立成本会计；五、加工定货合同公开，劳资双方各执一份；六、贯彻劳资两利方针；七、增添机器设备，改装不合理的机器；八、作好劳动保护工作，改善安全卫生设施；九、劳资双方共同制订生产计划；十、组织技术研究会，改进技术；十一、加强劳动纪律。该厂经理徐志周并在会上说：过去曾开假发票、假购货证提出五亿多元资金，还有外地厂商欠本厂货款八亿元，这两笔资金收回后，除了保证按期退还赃款外，并保证扩大生产设备。各厂职工也都在会上保证遵守劳动纪律，协助资方搞好生产。亚光电器厂工人提出了四项保证：一、提高产量；二、提高质量；三、按期完成任务；四、加强物品保管工作。
    这些私营工厂的工人劳动条件一般是很坏的，过去工人提出要求，资方却置之不理。现在，各厂经理都保证逐步改进职工的福利，改善安全卫生设备，有的并决定接受工人意见，立即筹组安全检查小组，着手检查和改进安全设备的工作。
