The Beijing Municipal People's Government’s Standards and Measures for Classifying and Handling Industrial and Commercial Businesses in the "Five-Anti" Movement
(Approved by the 127th Session of the Government Administration Council on March 8, 1952)

    I. Law-Abiding Households
    Those who have not been found to have any illegal activities, who have also provided a written guarantee that they have no illegal activities, and who are estimated to have no problems after review. The handling method for this type of industrial and commercial business is to issue a law-abiding household notice.

    II. Basically Law-Abiding Households
    (A) Based on the individual's confession and guarantee, and government materials proving that the total amount of illegal income (mainly tax evasion, or small-scale shoddy work and use of inferior materials) is less than 2 million yuan, and after review, it is estimated that even if there is concealment, the problem is not significant and the nature is not egregious.
    (B) The total amount of illegal income exceeds 2 million yuan, but the circumstances are minor and they have made a thorough confession.

    The handling method for the above two types of industrial and commercial businesses is as follows: those with a total illegal income of less than 2 million yuan are generally exempted from repayment, and a small number with more serious circumstances are ordered to repay a portion at discretion; those with a total illegal income exceeding 2 million yuan are only required to return the excess; and both are given a basically law-abiding household treatment notice.

    III. Half Law-Abiding and Half Illegal Households
    (A) Those whose total illegal income from tax evasion, theft and fraud of state assets, and shoddy work and use of inferior materials exceeds 2 million yuan, and whose illegal activities have no other serious harmful effects other than causing direct economic losses to the state and the people.
    (B) Although the circumstances are more serious, they have thoroughly confessed and performed meritorious service to redeem themselves in the "Five-Anti" movement.

    The handling method for the above two types of half law-abiding and half illegal households is "repayment without penalty," and a half law-abiding and half illegal household treatment notice is issued.

    IV. Seriously Illegal Households
    (A) Those whose illegal income from tax evasion, theft and fraud of state assets, and shoddy work and use of inferior materials is relatively large and has serious harmful effects, or who refuse to confess even if there are no serious harmful effects.
    (B) Completely illegal households, but not guilty of heinous crimes, and who have thoroughly confessed and have meritorious performance, may have their punishment reduced and be included in this category of industrial and commercial businesses.

    The handling method for the above two types of seriously illegal households is that in addition to ordering them to return their illegal income, a fine will be imposed at discretion according to the circumstances.

    V. Completely Illegal Households (i.e., Extremely Seriously Illegal Households)
    (A) Thieves who have extremely serious harmful effects on the country's social construction undertakings (especially national defense military facilities) or the safety of the people.
    (B) Organizers of collective theft cases and major thieves.
    (C) Those who profit by stealing state economic intelligence, causing extremely serious losses to the state and the people, or who have other particularly egregious criminal acts.
    (D) Those who have serious illegal activities and refuse to confess or resist the movement.

    The handling method for the above four types of completely illegal households is to be dealt with according to law. In addition to ordering them to return their illegal income, they will be severely fined according to their circumstances, or sentenced to imprisonment. The most serious offenders may be sentenced to death, and a part or all of their property may be confiscated.

    VI. Handling of Bribery
    Except for small rebates in fair transactions or those who have been extorted without illegal income and should not be considered bribers, and those who are bribers but whose circumstances are minor, others who have engaged in bribery shall be fined according to their circumstances. Those who refuse to confess shall have their fines increased. Those whose circumstances are particularly serious shall have their sentences increased.

    VII. Statute of Limitations for Illegal Activities
    Illegal income from tax evasion and shoddy work and use of inferior materials will generally only be repaid for 1951, and repayment for years prior to 1951 will be waived. However, those who refuse to confess and whose circumstances are particularly serious may be ordered to repay for one and a half years or two years, two and a half years or three years at discretion. Other illegal activities and illegal income are generally calculated from the date of the founding of the People's Republic of China, i.e., October 1, 1949. However, concealment and embezzlement of enemy and puppet property should be calculated from the date of Japan's surrender. Among them, those whose amount of concealment and embezzlement of enemy and puppet property is not large and has no serious harmful effect on the country may not be pursued.

    北京市人民政府在“五反”运动中关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法
    （一九五二年三月八日政务院第一百二十七次政务会议批准）
    一、守法户
    迄未发现有任何违法行为，本人也具结保证无违法行为，经审查结果估计无问题者。对于这类工商户的处理办法，即给以守法户通知书。
    二、基本守法户
    （甲）根据本人坦白具结及政府已有材料证明，其违法所得（主要是偷漏税，或小额偷工减料）总额未满二百万元，经审查结果估计纵有隐瞒，问题不大而又性质不恶劣者。
    （乙）违法所得总额超过二百万元，但情节轻微，并彻底坦白者。
    对于以上两种工商户的处理办法，其违法所得总额未满二百万元者，一般免退，少数情节较重者酌退一部；其违法所得总额超过二百万元者，只令其退出超过部分；并均给以基本守法户处理通知书。
    三、半守法半违法户
    （甲）偷税漏税、盗骗国家资财、偷工减料等违法所得总额超过二百万元，其违法行为除使国家、人民直接遭受经济损失以外，无其他严重危害作用者。
    （乙）情节虽较严重，但在“五反”中已彻底坦白并立功赎罪者。
    对于以上两种半守法半违法户的处理办法是“补退不罚”，并给以半守法半违法户处理通知书。
    四、严重违法户
    （甲）偷税漏税、盗骗国家资财、偷工减料等违法所得数量较大又有严重危害作用者，或虽无严重危害作用，但拒不坦白者。
    （乙）完全违法户，但尚非罪大恶极，且已彻底坦白，并有立功表现者，得减轻其处罚，列入本类工商户。
    对于以上两种严重违法户的处理办法，除令其退出违法所得外，并按情节酌处罚金。
    五、完全违法户（即极严重违法户）
    （甲）对于国家社会建设事业（特别是国防军事设施），或人民安全有极严重危害作用的盗窃犯。
    （乙）集体盗窃案的组织者和大盗窃犯。
    （丙）藉盗窃国家经济情报牟利，使国家人民遭受极严重损失，或有其他特别恶劣的犯罪行为者。
    （丁）有严重违法行为，拒不坦白或抗拒运动者。
    对于以上四种完全违法户的处理办法，应予法办，除令其退出违法所得外，并按其情节从重处以罚金，或判徒刑，最重者可判死刑，并没收其财产的一部或全部。
    六、关于行贿行为的处理
    除在公平交易中的小额回扣或被勒索而无违法所得不应认为行贿者以及虽属行贿但情节轻微者外，其他凡有行贿行为者，应按其情节处以罚金。拒不坦白者，应加重其罚金。情节特别严重者，应加重处刑。
    七、关于违法行为的追算期限
    偷税漏税、偷工减料两项违法所得，一般只补退一九五一年的，一九五一年以前的免予补退。但拒不坦白及情节特别严重者，得酌情令其补退一年半或二年，二年半或三年。其他各项违法行为和违法所得，一般自中华人民共和国成立之日即一九四九年十月一日算起。惟隐匿侵吞敌伪财产，应自日本投降之日算起。其中隐匿侵吞敌伪财产的数量不大，并对国家无严重危害作用者，可以不予追究。
