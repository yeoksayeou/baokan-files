    The Fundamental Solution to the German Question Through Peaceful Means

    In its note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on March 10, the Soviet government presented a draft of principles for a German peace treaty. This draft specifically and clearly stipulates the principles for swiftly concluding a German peace treaty, so as to make Germany a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving nation. These principles are an important plan for the peaceful resolution of the German question and conducive to laying the foundation for peace in Europe and the world. Therefore, it will inevitably be warmly welcomed and supported by the German people, the European people, and all peace-loving people around the world.

    It has been almost seven years since the end of the war against Germany. However, due to the consistent implementation by the American, British, and French imperialists of their sinister policy of splitting Germany and conspiring to use Germany's war potential as a stake for launching a new war, a German peace treaty has not yet been concluded, and Germany has not yet been able to restore peace and unity. Recently, at the Lisbon meeting of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, American imperialism dragged a West Germany, which is stepping up rearmament, into the Western European aggressive group, causing a serious threat to peace in Europe and the world. This situation, of course, cannot but arouse anxiety and opposition from the German people and the European people.

    In complete contrast to the sinister policy of the American and British imperialists, since the end of the war against Germany, the Soviet Union has repeatedly and resolutely put forward proposals for the peaceful settlement of the German question in the United Nations and other international conferences; all measures taken by the Soviet Union concerning the German question after the war are in complete conformity with the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement. The Soviet Union's policy towards Germany is to make Germany a unified, peace-loving, and democratic country, allowing her to maintain friendly relations and peaceful cooperation with other countries in the world with equal rights and status. The Soviet Union's draft principles for a German peace treaty are also based entirely on this policy.

    The Soviet government's draft principles for a German peace treaty are fully in line with the sincere desire of the German, European, and world people for peace and opposition to war, and is the fundamental solution to the German question and the elimination of European tensions. Whether the United States, Britain, and France are willing to accept this plan will be yet another test of whether they are sincerely willing to peacefully resolve the German question.

### 和平解决德国问题的根本方案

    和平解决德国问题的根本方案
    苏联政府在三月十日致美英法三国照会中提出了对德和约原则草案。这个草案具体明确地规定了迅速缔结对德和约，以便使德国成为一个统一、独立、民主与爱好和平的国家的各项原则。这些原则，是和平解决德国问题并有利于奠定欧洲和世界和平的重要方案，因而它必然会受到德国人民、欧洲人民与全世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎和拥护。
    对德战争结束到现在，已经快要七年了。但是由于美英法帝国主义一贯地执行着分裂德国并阴谋利用德国的战争潜力作为发动新战争的赌本的罪恶政策，因而对德和约至今不能缔结，德国至今不能恢复和平与统一。最近在北大西洋侵略集团的里斯本会议上，美帝国主义又把正在加紧重新武装的西德拖入西欧侵略集团，使得欧洲与世界的和平遭受到严重的威胁。这种情形当然不能不引起德国人民和欧洲人民的焦虑和反对。
    与美英帝国主义这种罪恶政策完全相反，苏联自对德战争结束以来，在联合国及其他的一些国际会议上，屡次坚决地提出了和平解决德国问题的主张；苏联在战后所采取的一切有关德国问题的措施，都完全符合于波茨坦协定的精神。苏联的对德政策是使德国成为一个统一的、爱好和平的民主国家，让她以平等的权利和地位与世界其他国家保持友好关系与和平合作。苏联这次所提出的关于对德和约的原则草案，也完全是从这种政策出发的。
    苏联政府关于对德和约的原则草案，是完全符合于德国、欧洲和全世界人民渴望和平、反对战争的真诚愿望的，是解决德国问题并消除欧洲紧张局势的根本方案。美、英、法三国是否愿意接受这一方案，将是它们是否真诚愿意和平解决德国问题的又一次考验。
