(Xinhua News Agency) The local organizations of various democratic parties in Northeast China and various people's organizations in the Northeast region have unanimously endorsed Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement of March 8 and protested against the heinous crimes of the US aggressors in blatantly conducting bacteriological warfare in the Northeast region of our country. People's organizations in Liaodong Province and Fushun City have called on people from all walks of life to take immediate action to deliver a forceful blow to the crazed American bacteriological war criminals.

The Northeast Provisional Working Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Northeast General Branch of the China Democratic League, and the Preparatory Committee of the Shenyang Branch of the China National Democratic Construction Association jointly issued a statement saying: This new atrocity by the US aggressors will not only fail to intimidate the heroic Chinese people, but on the contrary, will further strengthen our determination to unite against the enemy. We vow to fully launch the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, support the Korean front, and thoroughly crush all the aggressive plots of the US imperialists.

The six people's organizations in the Northeast region jointly issued a statement saying: The people of Northeast China will never forget the towering crimes committed by Japanese imperialism in conducting bacteriological weapons experiments and poisoning our compatriots during its occupation of Northeast China. Now, US imperialism is colluding with these Japanese bacteriological war criminals, who are laden with blood debts, to once again spread bacteria and poisonous insects within the borders of our Northeast, blatantly conducting bacteriological warfare. We, the people of Northeast China, fully endorse Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement of the 8th of this month. We will certainly severely punish these American murderers who spread bacteria and bombard and strafe our people in Northeast China.

The Federation of Northeast Natural Science Societies issued a statement saying: We natural science workers, especially those engaged in pathology and entomology, vow to actively participate in epidemic prevention work with practical actions to extinguish the poisonous flames of the bacteriological warfare waged by the US aggressors.

The Liaodong Provincial Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association, the Liaodong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Liaodong Provincial Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Liaodong Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, and the Liaodong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles have each issued statements, strongly protesting the crimes of US imperialism in expanding bacteriological warfare, and calling on the people of the entire province to mobilize, actively participate in various epidemic prevention organizations to eliminate bacteria and poisonous insects, and at the same time, to take more active actions to increase production, practice thrift, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers.

The Fushun City Federation of Trade Unions, the Coal Mine General Union, the Fushun City Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, and the Fushun Democratic Women's Federation jointly issued a protest letter on the 6th, saying: The US aggressors' adoption of such base and shameless means against the people of Fushun City only makes us more clearly recognize their hideous faces and proves that they are making a desperate struggle on their deathbed! The protest letter stated: We vow to fully mobilize workers, youth, women, and the people of the entire city to quickly eliminate the bacteria and poisonous insects spread by US imperialism, and to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army with practical actions to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, increase production, and practice thrift, in order to fight for the victory of crushing the conspiracy of the US aggressors and defending world peace!

The Fushun City Branch of the Northeast Health Workers Association also issued a protest letter, expressing confidence in crushing all the shameless conspiracies of the enemy on the front lines of defending against bacteriological warfare.
