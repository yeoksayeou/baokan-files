Soviet Astronomers Successfully Observe Solar Eclipse

    A special observation team composed of Soviet astronomers successfully completed the observation of the solar eclipse on February 25th.

    To observe the solar eclipse on February 25th, the Soviet Academy of Sciences carried out extensive preparations in advance. According to calculations, the moon's shadow would appear on the Earth near the Atlantic equator at 10:39 AM Moscow time on that day, passing through Africa, Arabia, Iran, and entering Soviet territory at Ashkhabad. The total eclipse could be seen in a band approximately one hundred kilometers wide traversing the Central Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and eastern Siberia. The longest duration of the total eclipse, approximately two minutes or more, was observed in the Achiman suburb west of Ashkhabad. The Soviet Academy of Sciences organized a special committee to coordinate the observation work, chaired by Academician Fesenkov; and dispatched ten observation teams, equipped with new Soviet-made astronomical instruments and equipment, to work in various regions where the total eclipse could be seen.

    After completing the observation work, Academician Fesenkov spoke to a TASS reporter about the progress of the observation work. He said: When observing the solar eclipse at Chili Station in the Kazakh Republic, the sky was very clear, and the main observation teams from the Central Observatory, Abastumani, Tashkent, Kiev, and Lvov observatories successfully completed their planned observations. In the Achiman sanatorium near Ashkhabad, the sky conditions were poor, but the observation team from the State Sternberg Astronomical Institute also carried out all the planned observations through gaps in the thin cirrus clouds there. In the Mointy area west of Lake Balkhash, the sky became completely overcast on the eve of the solar eclipse. The observation team that went there was unable to use their equipment and instruments, so they used an airplane to observe from the air. The plane carried three photographers and one cinematographer. The plane broke through the clouds and reached a clear sky at an altitude of about three thousand meters. At the Astrophysical Observatory of the Kazakh Academy of Sciences in the high mountains near Alma-Ata, only celestial photometry observations were carried out due to cloudy skies, and the largest change in the solar eclipse observed there reached 87 percent. They used a two-meter refracting telescope to take twenty-five photographs of the crescent-shaped sun, which allows us to accurately calculate the relative positions of the moon and the sun, and can provide material for revising the lunar ephemeris.

    Academician Fesenkov said: On the whole, the 1952 solar eclipse observation work was successful. The preliminary results of the observation work will be summarized soon, and the members of the observation teams will exchange opinions at the meeting of the Astronomical Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences to be held in Tashkent from March 3rd to 8th.

    苏联天文学家观测日蚀成功
    苏联天文学家所组成的特别观测队在二月二十五日顺利完成了观测日蚀的工作。
    为了观测二月二十五日的日蚀，苏联科学院在事先进行了广泛的筹备工作。根据推算，月球的阴影将于当日莫斯科时间十点三十九分在地球上大西洋赤道附近出现，经过非洲、阿拉伯、伊朗、在阿什哈巴德进入苏境。全蚀在横贯土库曼、乌兹别克、哈萨克等中亚细亚共和国和西伯利亚东部的约一百公里宽的带状地区可以看到。阿什哈巴德以西阿奇曼郊区所见到的全蚀时间最长，约在两分钟以上。苏联科学院组织了一个专门委员会负责调配观测工作，委员会由费森科夫院士主持；并派出十个配备着苏联制造的新式天文仪器和器械的观测队，分布到可以看到全蚀的各地区工作。
    费森科夫院士在完成观测工作后，对塔斯社记者谈观测工作的进行情况。他说：在哈萨克共和国赤利车站观测日蚀时，天空十分晴朗，中央天文台、阿巴斯图曼、塔什干、基辅和罗夫等天文台的主要观测队都顺利地完成了预定的观测计划。在阿什哈巴德附近的阿奇曼疗养区，天空的情况较差，但是，国立斯特恩堡天文学研究所观测队在那里透过稀薄卷云的隙缝也进行了一切预定的观测工作。在巴尔喀什湖以西的莫因提区，天空在日蚀的前夕完全变阴。到那里去的观测队无法使用他们的设备与仪器，于是用一架飞机升空进行观测。飞机上载着三个照相师和一个电影摄影师。飞机冲过云层，约在三千公尺的高度达到了晴朗的天空。在阿拉木图附近高山上的哈萨克科学院天体物理学观象台，因为天空多云只进行了天体光度测定的观测，那里所见到的日蚀最大的变象达到百分之八十七。他们用两公尺长的折光望远镜拍摄了二十五张月牙形的太阳的照片，这些照片使我们可以精确地计算月球与太阳的相对的地位，并且可以获得修正月球运转学说的材料。
    费森科夫院士说：整个说来，一九五二年日蚀观测的工作是成功的。观测工作的初步结果即将加以总结，各观测队的队员将要在苏联科学院定于三月三日至八日在塔什干举行的天文学委员会会议上交换意见。
