Thoroughly Confess Crimes, Willing to Compensate for Losses, Striving for Meritorious Service to Expiate Crimes
Tianjin City Releases a Batch of Illegal Industrialists and Businessmen

The Tianjin People's Court, adhering to the policy of combining severe punishment with leniency, recently released thirty-three illegal industrialists and businessmen. After being arrested, these illegal industrialists and businessmen confessed to their crimes relatively quickly and thoroughly, expressed their willingness to compensate for the losses suffered by the state, and some actively reported other unscrupulous merchants, striving for meritorious service to expiate their crimes. Therefore, the People's Government adopted a lenient approach towards them, exempting them from criminal punishment; matters concerning economic restitution and fines will be discussed separately. Among these released illegal merchants, for example, Feng Shounan, the general manager of Southeast Raincoat Factory, used inferior cloth as superior cloth, stole raw materials, falsely reported costs, and bribed cadres of the People's Bank to defraud the state of 300 million yuan in loans when accepting state processing orders for the production of raincoats. After being arrested, he confessed to his various illegal activities during interrogation and proactively provided relevant materials to the court. Li Yanghe, the manager of Jianyuan Industrial Cooperative, frequently evaded business tax. After being reported by workers of the cooperative during this movement, he not only refused to honestly admit his mistakes but also attempted to close down the business under false pretenses to retaliate by dismissing workers. After being arrested, he confessed to his tax evasion crimes and also confessed to stealing raw materials when undertaking processing work. He also expressed his willingness to bow his head and admit his guilt to the workers who reported him, ensuring that he would no longer use illegal means to threaten workers and resolving to work hard in business. After obtaining the consent of the factory's workers through the Tenth District Thrift Inspection Sub-Committee, the court ordered Li to be released on bail. Lin Xingwen, the manager of Qinghe Weaving Factory, concealed enemy property cotton yarn and stole a total of eighty-two pieces of cotton yarn processed for the Hua Sha Bu Company, with a total value of over 600 million yuan. After being arrested, the offender had a relatively honest attitude, willing to repent and start anew, and compensate for the state's losses. Wang Fenglin, the manager of Yishan Hemp Rope Shop, falsely reported losses and stole more than 60,000 jin of raw hemp when purchasing raw hemp on behalf of the North China Regional Raw Hemp Joint Purchasing Office. When handing over the raw hemp, he used inferior goods as superior goods, causing great losses to the state. He also refused to honestly explain the problem during this movement. After being arrested, he confessed to all the problems during the first interrogation. After being released, these unscrupulous merchants were extremely grateful for the lenient treatment of the People's Government and expressed their determination to repent and start anew, and to be honest and legitimate industrialists and businessmen.

    彻底供认罪行愿意赔偿损失争取戴罪立功
    天津市一批违法工商业者已被释放
    天津市人民法院本严惩与宽大相结合的政策，日前先后释放了三十三个违法工商业者。这些违法工商业者被逮捕后，比较迅速和彻底地供认了所犯的罪行，表示愿赔偿国家所受的损失，有的并积极检举别的奸商，争取戴罪立功。因此，人民政府对他们采取宽大处理，免予刑事处分；关于经济上的退赃与罚款等问题，另行议处。这些被释放的不法商人中，如东南雨衣厂总经理冯守南，曾在接受国家加工定货承制雨衣时，以坏布顶好布，偷窃原料，虚报成本，并贿赂人民银行干部，骗取国家三亿元的贷款；被捕之后，在审讯中供认了自己的各种不法行为，并主动向法院提供有关材料。建元工业社经理李养和经常偷漏营业税，在这次运动中为该社工人检举后，不但不老实承认自己的错误，反而意图借故歇业，以解雇工人进行报复；被捕后，他供出了自己的偷税罪行，还供出了自己承制加工活时尚有偷窃原料的行为，并表示愿意向检举他的工人低头认罪，保证不再用非法手段威胁工人，决心努力经营，经十区节约检查分会征得该厂工人的同意，当由法院令李犯取保后予以释放。庆和织布厂经理林兴文，隐匿敌产棉纱及偷窃为花纱布公司加工的棉纱共达八十二件，总值在六亿元以上。该犯被捕后态度比较老实，愿意悔过自新，赔偿国家的损失。益善麻绳庄经理王凤林，在代华北区原麻联购处收购原麻时，虚报损耗，偷窃原麻六万多斤，在上缴原麻时又以坏货顶好货，造成国家很大损失，在这次运动中也不老实交代问题；被捕以后，在第一次审讯中即将全部问题供认出来。这批奸商被释放后，对人民政府对他们的宽大处理，感戴万分，均表示决心悔过自新，要作一个老老实实的正当工商业者。（新华社）
