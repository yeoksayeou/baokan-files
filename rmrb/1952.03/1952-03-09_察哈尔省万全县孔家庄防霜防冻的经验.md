The experience of using burning Artemisia to prevent frost damage by the masses in Kongjiazhuang, Wanquan County, Chahar Province, has proven to be very effective. Last year, Wanquan County suffered widespread drought followed by severe frost damage, resulting in a harvest of only 30-40% of a normal year in general; however, Kongjiazhuang, after implementing frost prevention measures, achieved a harvest of over 60%.

Last spring and summer, Kongjiazhuang experienced a drought, and most crops had to be replanted or resown, resulting in a later maturity, which increased the risk of frost damage. After the first frost on September 7th, the village's Communist Party branch secretary and the village head led the masses in organizing a frost prevention committee and convened a mass meeting to mobilize and organize the masses extensively. Under the leadership of the frost prevention committee, the village organized seven large groups and thirty-three small groups (each with more than ten households) and defined frost prevention methods. On the night of September 8th, the entire village of more than 1,300 people (70% of the total population) carried out the first frost prevention battle. At dawn, inspection revealed that surrounding villages had suffered frost damage, and crops were dying; however, the crops in this village had not changed color. Educated by the facts, the enthusiasm of the masses for frost prevention was universally high, and they persisted for eleven consecutive nights. The organized and led frost prevention movement ensured that the crops did not suffer frost damage.

The specific method of defense is to use a kind of semi-dry Artemisia grass, plus some cow and horse manure, about 30-40 catties per pile. When the watchmen see the weather is right, they issue a signal, and everyone lights the Artemisia grass to create smoke to maintain the ground temperature. To control the time and unify actions, Kongjiazhuang set up a signal station, which was managed by a member of the Communist Youth League. Through this frost prevention effort, much valuable experience has been gained. They said: burning Artemisia must be done at a specific time; too early or too late will result in failure; the direction of ignition should be downwind, otherwise the smoke will be blown elsewhere; the general time for frost is between 3:00 and 4:00 in the morning; it is estimated that each mu requires 40-50 catties of Artemisia grass per night.

The victory of Kongjiazhuang's frost prevention struggle not only ensured that crops suffered less damage, but also shattered the masses' backward idea of "relying on heaven for food" and established the idea of "man can conquer nature."

Editor's note: The frost prevention method in Kongjiazhuang, Wanquan County, Chahar, should attract the attention of rural workers everywhere. This newspaper published news on June 13, 1950 about Shanxi Lan County, Qin Yuan and other places to prevent spring frost using the same method. Facts have proved that this method is effective for preventing autumn frost and spring freeze. On August 11, 1950, this newspaper published an article written by the Meteorological Bureau of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government entitled "On the Prevention of Hail and Frost Damage". The following paragraph on frost prevention is now reprinted below:

"Using 'beacon fire' to prevent frost is indeed a very effective scientific method. Although the temperature of the local air near the ground will not be greatly increased, the smoke it emits covers the ground, which can prevent the dissipation of heat energy from the ground and prevent the temperature of the air near the ground from dropping sharply, which is enough to prevent the occurrence of frost damage. The effect of 'beacon fire' to prevent frost is not to melt the formed frost into water droplets or water vapor, but to set off 'beacon fire' in advance (not arson, mainly to produce thick smoke) on nights when there is a possibility of frost formation, and the emission of heat and smoke can greatly reduce the possibility of frost formation. This method is scientific, effective, and worthy of promotion."

    察哈尔省万全县孔家庄防霜防冻的经验
    钱章益
    察哈尔省万全县孔家庄的群众，用青蒿燃烟的办法防御霜灾，已经证明十分有效。万全县去年普遍遭受旱灾以后，又普遍遭受严重霜灾，一般仅有三、四成年景；但孔家庄经过防霜后，却得到了六成以上的年景。
    去年春夏两季，孔家庄曾经发生旱灾，大部分庄稼是补种改种过的，成熟期较晚，这样就有遭受冻灾的危险了。九月七日第一次下霜后，这个村的中共支部书记和村长领导群众组织了防霜委员会，同时召开了群众大会，把群众广泛地动员组织起来。在防霜委员会领导下，全村共组织了七个大组，三十三个小组（每小组有十多户），并规定了防霜的办法。九月八日晚，全村一千三百多人（占总人口百分之七十）进行了第一次防霜斗争。到天亮检查，周围各村都遭受霜害，庄稼垂死；但这个村的庄稼都未变色。在事实教育下，群众防霜情绪普遍高涨，一连坚持了十一夜。在有组织、有领导的防霜运动中，保证了庄稼没有遭受霜害。
    防御的具体办法是用一种半干不湿的蒿草，加上些牛马粪，以三、四十斤为一堆，待守望的人看准气象，发起信号，大家一齐点火烧蒿，使蒿烟保持地面温度。为掌握时间，统一行动，孔家庄专门设立了一个司号台，由一位青年团员负责任。经过这次防霜，已获得很多的宝贵的经验。他们说：燃蒿必须有一定时间，过早过晚，都会失败；点火方向要顺风，否则烟会被吹到别处去；一般下霜的时间是在晚间三、四点钟；估计每亩每夜需要燃蒿草四、五十斤。
    孔家庄防霜斗争的胜利，不但保证庄稼减轻了灾害，并打破了群众“靠天吃饭”的落后意识，树立起“人定胜天”的思想。
    编者按：察哈尔万全县孔家庄的防霜办法，应该引起各地农村工作者的注意。本报在一九五零年六月十三日即曾登载过山西岚县、沁源等地用同样办法防止春冻的消息。事实证明，用这个办法防止秋霜和春冻都是有效的。一九五零年八月十一日，本报发表了中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会气象局写的一篇题为“关于冰雹和霜害的防止问题”的文章，现在把这篇文章中关于防霜问题的一段话重新刊载在下面：
    “利用‘烽火’防霜，确是很有效的科学方法。因为近地面局部空气的温度，虽不会因此而大量地增高，然而它所发散的烟笼罩着地面，却可以阻止地面热能的发散，使近地空气温度不至于急烈地下降，足以防止霜害的发生。‘烽火’防霜的效用，并不是把结成的霜溶化为水滴或水气，而是在有成霜可能的夜晚，预先放起“烽火”（不是放火，主要是使它产生浓烟），热和烟的发散就可以使凝霜的可能性大为减少。这种方法是科学的，有效的，值得提倡。”
