	Beware of Merchants' Plots When Filling Out Forms

	To the Editor: Many merchants are being very dishonest when filling out the "Investigation Form for Handling Illegal Industrial and Commercial Households," attempting to muddle through. Workers at Beijing Juxiangyi reviewed the form filled out by the capitalist and, believing he was being dishonest, refused to stamp it as approved. The merchant then called the worker over, said sweet words about how wrong he had been in the past and how he would change in the future, and then knelt down to kowtow to the worker. The worker was so angry that he ignored him and walked away. The Heji Basket Shop merchant illegally carved the workers' seals and stamped them on the form. When the explanation team inquired with the workers, everyone was baffled. The Yitaichang merchant, fearing that he would not pass, said to the workers: "If you stamp this, you will all get double pay and bonuses; you can do whatever you want!" The Yuan Shunyong Oil and Salt Shop owner repeatedly urged the workers to stamp the form quickly, saying, "You stamp it first, there are still some minor issues that can be explained after the form is stamped." When the Heyixuan Restaurant owner saw that the workers were unwilling to stamp the form, he actually said, "If that's the case, we'll just have to wait for the authorities to handle it; if there are no problems after the handling, you will be fully responsible." Some merchants did not go through all the workers, but instead had their confidants stamp the forms. These merchants are still unwilling to honestly lower their heads and are trying to attack the working class again. We should be vigilant and not be careless in the slightest.

    警惕奸商在填表时的阴谋
    编辑同志：很多奸商在填写“违法工商户处理调查表”时很不老实，企图混过“关”去。北京聚祥益工人审查了资方所填的表，认为他不老实，不予盖章通过，奸商就把工人找来，甜言蜜语地说了些过去怎样不对、今后怎样改过的话，接着跪下向工人叩头。工人气得理也不理就走开了。贺记筐铺奸商私刻工人的图章，盖在表上。当说理队询问工人时，大家都莫名其妙。义太昌奸商怕通不过，对工人们说：“你们要是盖了章，都有双薪和奖金，要怎么办就怎么办！”元顺永油盐店掌柜好几次要工人快些盖章，他说：“你们先盖吧，还有些小问题等盖章处理后再交代。”合义轩饭馆掌柜看见工人不肯盖章，竟说：“你们既这样，咱们只好听候处理；如果处理后没有问题，你们要负全责。”有的商人不通过全体工人，而叫他们的亲信盖章了事。这些奸商到现在还不肯老实低头，想再向工人阶级进攻。我们应该提高警惕，丝毫不要麻痹大意。
