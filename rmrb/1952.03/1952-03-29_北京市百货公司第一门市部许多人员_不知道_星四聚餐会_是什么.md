To the Editor: Workers in state-owned enterprise organs should attach importance to current affairs study. However, the neglect of reading newspapers by the vast majority of personnel at the First Branch of the Beijing Department Store of China Department Store Company is very serious. The First Branch has more than 260 people and subscribes to 18 newspapers. Except for a few individuals, everyone is literate. However, most people are not concerned about the newspapers; they either do not read them at all, or just glance through them superficially. During the "Three-Anti" campaign, some people, because they participated in the "tiger hunting" work, paid even less attention to reading newspapers.

Because comrades do not care about the newspapers, many things that should be known are unknown to everyone. For example, the "Star Four Dinner Party" organized by illegal capitalists in Chongqing is still unknown to most people. It is intolerable that workers in state-owned enterprises lack the necessary understanding of the organized attacks of the bourgeoisie on the working class. It is particularly noteworthy that this situation also exists in other branches of the Beijing Department Store. Many salespersons in the branch used to be shop assistants in private shops, who only cared about working for the capitalists and could not read newspapers at all; however, now that they have come to state-owned enterprises and are able to read newspapers, they should read them, but they do not. This is not right. We hope that the trade union of the Beijing Department Store and relevant leading cadres will pay attention to this issue and strengthen political current affairs education for economic workers.

### 北京市百货公司第一门市部许多人员  不知道“星四聚餐会”是什么

    北京市百货公司第一门市部许多人员
    不知道“星四聚餐会”是什么
    编辑同志：国营企业机关中的工作人员，应该重视时事学习。但是，中国百货公司北京市公司第一门市部绝大部分人员，忽视读报的情况是很严重的。第一门市部共有二百六十多人，订了十八份报纸。除了个别人以外，大家都是有阅读能力的。但是，大多数人对于报纸是不关心的，他们根本不看报，或者只是走马观花地看一下。在“三反”运动中，有些人因为参加“打虎”工作，就更不注意看报了。
    由于同志们不关心报纸，许多应该知道的事，大家都不知道。如重庆破获的违法资本家组织的“星四聚餐会”，至今还有多数人不知道。国营企业的工作人员，对于资产阶级有组织地向工人阶级进攻的问题缺乏应有的认识，这是不能容忍的。值得特别注意的是，这种情形，在北京市百货公司的其他门市部也同样存在着。门市部许多业务员过去在私营商店中当店员，那时只顾给资本家干活，根本不能看报；可是，来到国营企业后能够读报，应该读报，但不读报，这就不对了。我们希望北京市百货公司工会和有关领导干部，重视这个问题，加强对于经济工作人员的政治时事教育。
