    Taiyuan City's Twenty-One Grocery Stores, Profiteering Merchants, Universally Skimp on Materials to Secretly Harm the Volunteer Army

    To the Editor: Twenty-one grocery stores in Taiyuan City are profiteering, skimping on materials, and deceiving the beloved Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Last July, the Shanxi Provincial Native Produce Company entrusted the grocery industry to make a batch of dried tofu for the Volunteer Army. The Native Produce Company asked them to make it according to the standards stipulated in the contract and issued more than 100,000 catties of soybeans. Dehechang was the first to violate the regulations and skimp on materials. When they made dried tofu, they all skimped on materials in terms of soybeans, charcoal, salt, and labor. Jin Shengzhan undertook 3,245 catties of dried tofu, from which it obtained a lot of illegal profits. Da Xingzhan, Zichenghao, Chengjihao, and others are also doing the same. We must not tolerate the criminal behavior of profiteers who undermine the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and endanger the interests of the people. We demand that the government give them severe punishment.

    太原市二十一家杂货店奸商普遍偷工减料暗害志愿军
    编辑同志：太原市二十一家杂货店奸商，偷工减料，欺骗人人敬爱的中国人民志愿军。去年七月，山西省土产公司委托杂货业做一批给志愿军吃的豆腐干。土产公司让他们按合同规定的标准去做，并发了十多万斤黄豆。德合长首先违反规定，偷工减料。他们在做豆腐干时，在黄豆、炭、盐、人工等方面，全都偷工减料。晋升栈承做三千二百四十五斤豆腐干，从中取得很多非法利润。大兴栈、资诚号、成记号等也是如此。我们决不能容忍奸商破坏抗美援朝斗争、危害人民利益的罪恶行为，我们要求政府给他们以严厉的惩处。
