    Never Forget the Atrocities of the American Aggressor Troops
    Jiaster
    I had repeatedly thought about coming to liberated China to see the Chinese people. But I always thought it was a dream. I never expected that this dream would come true, and I have come to the heart of this country. The Chinese people, who have overcome the corrupt and tyrannical rulers at home and the foreign imperialists, are inspiring our people—who are fighting for victory in our country—with their new spirit, new life, and courageous example.

    The beauty of Beijing is even more radiant when illuminated by the beauty of the new life of the Beijing people. Here, people have freedom from excessive exploitation, freedom from fear, the right to be a dignified and vibrant human being, and the right to choose and follow the path of peace—the path of peaceful construction and improving life. When a person walks on the soil of socialism, he cannot help but appreciate the miracle and joy of fighting for peace.

    During our arrival in Korea, the great tragedy of the war of aggression launched by the United States vividly and painfully appeared before us. This war was launched to destroy the new life that was being built at the time, to destroy human freedom and dignity.

    The scenes of horror and barbaric cruelty that I saw in Korea are something I will never forget. But just seeing is not enough. Because if the civilized people of the world do not rise up to restrain the hands of the war criminals, terror and barbarism will surely spread. The Korean incident is not an isolated event. It is part of the world plan of dangerous madmen.

    Let us not just look and leave, we must never forget! Not only must we not forget, but we must also actively strive to restore Korea's independence and safeguard world peace.

    Please forgive me for not speaking as a jurist. I am here only as a person. But I have a wife and three children whom I love. I have a motherland and a big city that I love. I have personally witnessed my motherland being bombed, and I have personally witnessed men and women, families like mine, being destroyed. The situation I personally witnessed in Korea was much worse than what I had experienced in our country. The massacres, barbaric destruction, and all kinds of beastly atrocities that I heard about were unprecedented.

    I remember a Korean woman, a mother of four children. Her husband left her home, and several American soldiers came to arrest her. Her two children, seven and two years old, clung tightly to her clothes. The American soldiers pulled the two-year-old child from her clothes and beat him to a pulp with a rifle butt right before her eyes.

    This is true, and it is just one of thousands of examples. Such things are absolutely intolerable.

    Today, I seem to see that mother summoning her strength to protect her remaining children! That kind of courage and that kind of heroism are unparalleled.

    But if I love my children and my country, I must know that that woman is now fighting not only for her children and family, but also for mine and yours.

    We must not let her fight alone.

    If each of us helps her fight in the way we want to, we are proud. But we have just begun this struggle, this struggle for peace, this struggle for life, this struggle for the future, and we must find ways to ensure our victory.

    不能忘记美国侵略军的暴行
    加斯特尔
    我曾经一再想着要到解放了的中国来看一看中国人民。但总以为是梦想。没有意料到这个梦想竟实现了，我来到了这个国家的心脏。战胜了国内腐朽暴虐的统治者和外国帝国主义者的中国人民，用他们新的精神、新的生活和勇敢的榜样激励着我们——正在争取胜利的我国人民。
    北京的美，只有在北京人民新生活的美的照耀下，才显得更加光辉。在这儿，人们有免除过分剥削的自由，有免除恐惧的自由，有做一个有尊严、有生命力的人的权利，有选择和遵循和平的道路——和平建设与改善生活的道路的权利。当一个人在社会主义的国土上走过的时候，他就不能不体味到为和平而斗争的奇迹和喜悦。
    我们在到达朝鲜期间，在我们前面，活生生地刺痛人心地出现着美国所发动的侵略战争的大悲剧。这场战争的发动，为的是要破坏当时正在建设的新生活，破坏人类的自由和尊严。
    我在朝鲜所看到的恐怖和野蛮残酷的情景，是一辈子不会忘记的。但仅仅看到是不够的。因为要不是全世界文明的人民起来扼住战犯们的手，恐怖和野蛮一定要扩展。朝鲜事件不是偶然的事件。这是危险的狂人们世界计划的一部分。
    我们不要一看了事，我们千万不要忘记！不但不忘记，还得积极奋发地努力，恢复朝鲜的独立，维护全世界的和平。
    请恕我不是以法学者的身分来讲话。我在这里只是一个人。但我有一个妻子和我所爱的三个孩子。我有我所爱的祖国和大城市。我曾经亲眼看见我的祖国遭受了轰炸，亲眼看见像我一样的男女家庭遭受了破坏。我在朝鲜所亲眼看到的情况，比我在我们国内曾经体验过的还要坏得多。我所听到的集体屠杀、野蛮破坏以及各种野兽暴行，都是史无前例的。
    我想起了一个朝鲜妇女，她是四个孩子的母亲。她的丈夫离开他的家，几个美国兵来抓她，七岁和两岁的两个孩子紧紧地拉住她的衣襟，那几个美国兵把两岁的那个孩子从她的衣襟上拉下来，并在她的眼前用枪柄把他打得稀烂。
    这是真事，这只是千万个实例中的一个。这样的事情是绝对不能容忍的。
    我今天仿佛看到那母亲鼓起了她的力量来保护她剩下的孩子们！那一种勇气和那一种英雄气概是无比的。
    但是如果我爱我的孩子们和我的祖国，我就必须知道：那个女人现在不仅是为了她的孩子和家庭，而且同样是为了我的和你的孩子和家庭而斗争。
    决不能让她一个人单独地斗争。
    如果我们各人用我们自己想得到的方式来帮助她的斗争，我们是骄傲的。但我们刚刚开始这个斗争，这个争取和平的斗争，争取生活的斗争，争取未来的斗争，我们还得设法保证我们胜利。
