Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 19th (TASS): The latest issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine published a lengthy article admitting that the U.S. military is actively conducting bacteriological weapons experiments. The magazine gave an affirmative answer to the question of "Can contagious diseases such as bubonic plague be created by artificial means?" and stated that "spreading poisonous animals and insects from airplanes over large areas of land" could accomplish this. In response to the question "Is the U.S. military actively conducting bacteriological weapons experiments?" the magazine said: "Yes, it is. They have been doing so since the beginning of World War II. It is known that more than four thousand bacteriologists are working at the bacteriological laboratory at Camp Detrick near Frederick (Maryland)." From the magazine's response, it can be further seen that the United States intends to widely use bacteriological weapons.

    美国反动的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志供认
    美国军队曾长期进行细菌武器试验
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社纽约十九日讯：最近一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志刊载长文，承认美国军队积极进行细菌武器的试验。该杂志对“用人为手段是否可以造成腺鼠疫之类的传染病？”这一问题，给以肯定的回答，并说：“由飞机上向大片土地撒布有毒的动物和昆虫”就可以办到这件事。该杂志答复“美国军队是否在积极进行细菌武器的试验？”这一问题说：“是在进行。他们从第二次世界大战开始时起，就在进行。大家知道，有四千多个细菌学者在佛烈德利克（马里兰州）附近狄特里克营的细菌试验所工作。”从该杂志的答复中可以进一步看出，美国打算广泛使用细菌武器。
