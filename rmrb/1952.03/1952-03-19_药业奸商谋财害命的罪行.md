The lawless elements of the greedy bourgeoisie have long treated the lives of the people as objects for profiteering. Following the incidents of the奸商 Wang Kangnian defrauding the Volunteer Army of huge sums of money for purchasing medicines, and奸商 Li Yinting using rotten cotton as emergency bandages to harm the Volunteer Army, serious crimes of manufacturing and selling fake and inferior medicines, disregarding the people's health, have been exposed in almost every large and medium-sized city including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Xi'an, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Jinan, Taiyuan, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Yangzhou, Wuxi, Qingdao, Bengbu, Guiyang, and Anshan. These bloody facts once again demonstrate the ugly nature of the bourgeoisie. They are not just generally seeking personal gain at the expense of others, but are willing to endanger lives for the sake of making money.

The methods used by these pharmaceutical shop奸商 to harm the people and defraud them of their money, besides the most common practice of raising drug prices and making exorbitant profits of several times, dozens of times, or even one or two hundred times, include the following most insidious and vicious practices:

First, they cut corners and adulterate medicines during manufacturing, using inferior goods as good goods, reducing the effectiveness of the medicines, and even causing significant side effects. Many traditional Chinese medicine shops sell Niuhuang Qingxin Pills that contain no Niuhuang at all; Lingqiao Jiedu Pills that contain no antelope horn; and when manufacturing lactose pepsin, they do not use lactose at all, but replace it with powdered sugar, and only add a little pepsin. They mix elephant fritillary into Sichuan fritillary (Sichuan fritillary is dozens of times more expensive than elephant fritillary); after slightly processing buffalo horn, they pass it off as rhinoceros horn and antelope horn, which are worth more than 2 million yuan per tael, making a profit of more than 1.9 million yuan per tael. According to the results of a key inspection of fifteen traditional Chinese medicine shops in Shenyang City by the Municipal Health Bureau and the Traditional Chinese Medicine Review Committee at the end of last year, it was proven that not a single one did not sell fake medicines or cut corners. In the most serious cases, the amount of materials cut was more than 60%, and in the least cases, it was more than 30%. The medicines with reduced ingredients are generally the expensive ones such as musk, antelope horn, and ginseng. These valuable medicines are often kept by the pharmacy managers themselves, and when preparing medicines, they use "family secret recipes" as an excuse not to announce the dosage to the workers, in order to achieve the purpose of reducing ingredients. These bad behaviors also exist seriously in the new pharmaceutical industry. They manufacture glucose injections by substituting white granulated sugar for glucose, table salt for hydrochloric acid, and grind tea into powder, press it into tablets, and sell it as digitalis leaf powder tablets, add water to Yalin deodorant water, add Xiaozhilong to Xiafadeyajing powder, and so on. In addition,奸商 in Shanghai, Hangzhou and other places have also been found to manufacture and sell drugs with insufficient ingredients, including pagoda sugar, Xiaozhilong, Xiafadeyajing, penicillin, quinine and aspirin. For example, the quinine pills sold by Hangzhou Hui'erkang Pharmacy are labeled as containing 0.13 grams of quinine per pill, but in reality, they only contain 0.0133 grams, and the rest is starch or flour. The DDT powder from Tongchun Pharmacy claims to be 100% pure, but actually only contains 25%. The ergot tincture sold by Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory, which is specifically used for hemostasis in women's uterine bleeding, should have a quarter of the ingredient as ergot fluid extract, but this pharmaceutical factory only used one-twentieth, not knowing how many women were killed. Coramine is a life-saving cardiotonic, and the purchase price per bottle is 300,000 yuan. When this pharmaceutical factory fills prescriptions for patients, it dilutes the medicine with water, and still sells it for 7 million yuan per bottle. The illegal profits obtained by these奸商 through such bad means are shocking. For example, Zhou Ruifang, a奸商 from Nanjing Peihe Pharmaceutical Factory, used 2,400 pounds of lactose powder with a little other ingredients, pressed into more than 2 million tablets of fake Xiaozhilong, Xiafamingding, and gastrointestinal anti-inflammatory tablets with insufficient ingredients, and made a profit of more than 1 billion yuan. Zhou Shilu, the owner of Hangzhou Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory, used table salt instead of "hydrochloric acid" and chaff charcoal instead of cow blood in the manufacturing of "Silicon Carbon Silver" and other methods of cutting corners. In the past two years, this one medicine alone has obtained illegal profits of more than 800 million yuan. In addition, when filling prescriptions for patients, many pharmacies collude with doctors, and patients must go to the pharmacy designated by the doctor to fill their prescriptions after seeing a doctor. The pharmacy does not give enough medicine at all, or uses inferior medicine to replace good medicine. The pharmacy then takes a portion of the illegal profits and gives it to the doctor as a kickback. According to materials revealed by store employees, it is a common phenomenon for traditional Chinese medicine stores to cut corners when filling prescriptions, and the degree of cutting corners often reaches about 50% or even 70%.

Second, counterfeiting. In order to sell the medicines they manufacture with insufficient ingredients and poor quality smoothly and defraud illegal profits, many奸商 often disguise bad medicines as imported goods; if it is traditional Chinese medicine, they generally stamp it with the seal of a certain Beijing hall on the packaging. Some奸商 put bad penicillin into empty bottles of penicillin produced by a certain foreign pharmaceutical factory and sell it at several times the price. Some put pure jinglatuo, which cannot cure coughs, into empty bottles of Jiguai jinglatuo, which specializes in treating coughs. According to preliminary statistics in Wuxi City, there have been 16 types of fake medicines masquerading as products of Japanese pharmaceutical factories on the market in the past two years since liberation, 19 types masquerading as products of German pharmaceutical factories, and 22 types masquerading as other brands, all of which are commonly used medicines.

There are also many奸商 who sell Xiafamingding, which has the same properties but has a large difference in efficacy, as Xiaozhilong, and Xiaozhilong as Xiafadeyajing. The reason is that these奸商 only see that Xiafadeyajing sells for 1,800 yuan per tablet, Xiafamingding only sells for 300 yuan per tablet, and Xiaozhilong sells for 700 yuan per tablet. Originally, Xiafadeyajing is generally used to treat pneumonia in children, and its side effects are small, while Xiafamingding and Xiaozhilong not only have small effects, but also have greater side effects. All 63 pharmacies in Wuxi City have done this deceptive crime. Wu Pengling and Wang Zhengzhong,奸商 in Yangzhou City, once sold 130,000 tablets of Xiafamingding disguised as Xiaozhilong. Among the 7.4 billion yuan of medicines sold by the South China Pharmacy in Guangzhou to a certain military agency, all of them were counterfeit goods, or of poor quality and higher than the market price. Preliminary statistics show that the state lost more than 1.5 billion yuan.

In the traditional Chinese medicine industry, this extremely bad deceptive style also exists everywhere. Generally, inferior goods, bad goods, or medicines with insufficient weight are stamped with a fake seal and wholesaled everywhere. For example, Yongletang Traditional Chinese Medicine Store in Qingdao City stamped the Lingqiao Jiedu Pills with insufficient weight, deer placenta cream made from beef, and tiger bone wine made from pig bones, all with a stamp of a certain Beijing hall.奸商 from Beijing Qingrentang, Qianzhitang and other traditional Chinese medicine stores even used tap water to impersonate gold juice water made from antelope horn, rhinoceros horn and snow water.

Third, selling ineffective medicines, manufacturing and selling fake medicines and drugs. There are many ways they sell ineffective medicines. In addition to directly selling ineffective medicines, they generally adopt extremely despicable deceptive methods, focusing on the expiration date on the trademark. Some remove the shell with the expiry date stamp, or tear off the expired bottle label, and then paste on the bottle label of an empty bottle that has been used but has not expired; some fade the words with the date of the year and month; some paste their own privately printed trademark paper on the expired medicines. In addition, there is another way, which is to take the expired medicines, slightly process them, and still sell them as good medicines. In short, in order to make money, they can think of any dirty trick. Many奸商 not only sell their own expired medicines, but also specialize in buying expired and ineffective medicines from the market. Yang Chunhua, the owner of Hangzhou Hui'erkang Pharmacy, once sent people to Shanghai to specialize in acquiring all expired and ineffective penicillin injections and selling them to Guangji Hospital. According to preliminary statistics over 20 months, Yang Chunhua sold more than 12,000 bottles of this kind of injection. The expired medicines sold by奸商 are not only general medicines, but many are also medicines for treating acute illnesses, such as 606, penicillin, rabies vaccine, tetanus vaccine, etc. Penicillin is specifically for treating acute pneumonia, acute meningitis and other diseases. If patients take ineffective penicillin, it will inevitably cause serious consequences.

In the manufacturing and selling of fake medicines, there are those who use yeast tablets to counterfeit Meyer vitamins, use starch to counterfeit BK quinine pills, and counterfeit penicillin, Xiaozhilong, and Xiafadeyajing; those who use table salt and tap water to manufacture various eye drops; and those who manufacture tetanus antitoxin with impure quality and containing toxicity. These fake medicines are manufactured in large quantities and promoted everywhere by奸商. Only the Tianjin奸商 Yan Hechun has been found to have privately manufactured more than 13,000 injections of tetanus antitoxin. When the Shanghai奸商 Ma Jusan was arrested, more than 10,000 injections of fake drugs, including Xili mercury containing unsterilized ten years of age, and more than 3,000 injections of Saint Louis antimony new containing unsterilized distilled water, as well as many similar fake drugs, were found at his place. As for publicly disregarding government decrees and privately manufacturing and selling contraband, poisoning people's spirits and bodies, it is also a common crime committed by pharmaceutical shop奸商. Various places have seized contraband or drugs privately sold by奸商, including morphine injections, codeine, opium tincture, etc.

In order to steal a large amount of state funds and harm the people, the奸商 also used various despicable and shameless means to drag the cadres of public medical and health institutions and enterprises into the water, or directly dispatched spies to control important departments, in order to cover up their criminal behavior, making it easy for fake and bad medicines to pass the inspection, and also stole a large amount of the state's medical equipment and supplies together with embezzlers, stole state economic intelligence, manipulated and monopolized the pharmaceutical market, and even killed a large number of people. For example, the Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory in Hangzhou City was strongly supported by the People's Government. In 1950, the factory's business was sluggish. The Health Department of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government accepted the factory's request and merged the factory's glass machinery manufacturing part with the Zhejiang People's Pharmaceutical Company to establish a joint public-private Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory and the Second Manufacturing Factory of the People's Pharmaceutical Company. Under the support of state-owned enterprises, the business of Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory gradually improved, and the turnover exceeded any year before liberation. However, Zhou Shilu, the general manager of this factory, repaid kindness with ingratitude, concealed more than 1 billion yuan of bureaucratic capital in his factory and a large number of machines left by the Japanese invaders, and also sent Yu Rongjian, the director of the Tongchun Pharmacy business department of Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory, and other three people to infiltrate the People's Pharmaceutical Company. Yu Rongjian seized the position of deputy director of the supply section in the People's Pharmaceutical Company and promoted various fake and bad medicines from Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory in large quantities. The total value of sales in more than a year was about 800 million yuan, making Minsheng Company the largest customer of the People's Pharmaceutical Company. Many medicines manufactured by the company itself, such as glucose and calcium chloride, could not be sold. The奸商 Zhou Shilu also used Yu Rongjian to spy on internal information and speculate. The奸商 Zhou Shilu also attacked other agencies and public enterprises, and some staff members in nearly 20 units were corrupted by him. According to his own unreliable confession, the illegal profits obtained by using this insidious and vicious means are very large. In 1951 alone, he obtained a gross profit of 2.8 billion yuan. Zhao Puzhi, the owner of Qingdao Anyu Pharmacy, mixed into the public-owned People's Pharmacy and became the deputy manager. He immediately gathered several奸商 to establish a Luoling Pharmacy, with him as the chairman. In addition to frequently purchasing medicines and equipment from the People's Pharmacy at low prices in the name of Luoling Pharmacy and monopolizing the medicines needed by public hospitals and clinics in the city, what was even more vicious was that when diphtheria was prevalent in Qingdao last year and hospitals and clinics urgently needed diphtheria antitoxin, he dared to suppress the medicines purchased by the People's Pharmacy in Shanghai and did not distribute them, but first sent a batch to Luoling Pharmacy to let them sell them at high prices and steal exorbitant profits. It was not until the diphtheria epidemic had passed that the medicines of the People's Pharmacy were sent back, and these medicines had already settled and could not be used. Chen Deshan, a奸商 from Anshan Jianning Pharmacy, colluded with the manager of Tianjin Sanshou Pharmacy in 1950 and broke into the public-owned Tianjin Pharmaceutical Company, monopolizing the trade of medical equipment and supplies between this company and Northeast, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin and other places, and made a profit of 20 billion yuan in one year. Ma Yongshan and Zhang Deheng, managers of Shenyang Huadong Pharmacy, and Tang Xian, manager of Shanghai Yongan Medical Equipment Company, after buying Gu Pengzhi, director of the pharmacy department of Fushun Mining Bureau Hospital, sold the equipment to this mining bureau hospital was broken and ragged, and many of them were unusable at all. For example, an X-ray machine worth more than 4 billion yuan can only photograph the hand, but cannot fluoroscope the lungs and lumbar spine; three microscopes worth more than 800 million yuan have lenses that are separately matched, and the parts are old and unusable at all; six refrigerators worth 460 million yuan were "guaranteed" to be used for two years, but they could not be used for a day; an electric knife worth 460 million yuan has a rusty blade; a rusted Type 99 surgical instrument was electroplated and charged with new ones. In the past three years, nearly half of the 30 billion yuan medical equipment fees spent by the hospital of the Fushun Mining Bureau through the embezzler Gu Pengzhi was stolen by Ma Yongshan and other奸商. These bad, fake, or non-compliant medical equipment and supplies have great harm to the lives and health of patients. Just one example can illustrate: In 1950, many children in Fushun City suffered from measles. Because the blood cell counter purchased by the hospital of Fushun Mining Bureau from the奸商 was inaccurate, it could not carry out effective treatment in time, resulting in an increase in the mortality rate of children.

Since liberation three years ago, due to the sale of fake medicines, bad medicines, and poisons by奸商 in various places, and the manipulation and monopoly of the pharmaceutical market, it is not known how many lives have been lost and how many people's health has been damaged. The First Municipal Hospital of Nanjing used the fake sandalwood made by the奸商 Zhou Ruifang to expel roundworms from patients, not only did it not expel the worms, but it also caused the patients to have dizziness and stomach pain; people with heart disease took the fake digitalis he manufactured, not only did their heart rate not slow down, but it accelerated. According to what has been found, in the summer of 1950, sixteen children treated for dysentery and pneumonia in the First Municipal Hospital of Nanjing died because they took his fake anti-inflammatory tablets and expired penicillin. The Nanjing Production and Education Institute also had 209 patients die as a result of using his fake medicines. Zhang Liyan, another奸商 in Nanjing who sells fake medicines, has now been found to have caused the death of 26 people in 14 agencies and enterprises. For example, Xie Minqiu, a nurse at the East China Military Region Hospital, suffered from dysentery, took more than 100 pills of Zhang Liyan's fake anti-inflammatory tablets, but to no effect, and died of delayed treatment. Qiang Yaoxian's daughter, an employee of Yonglining Factory, suffered from pneumonia and took six injections of Zhang Liyan's expired penicillin a day. Her skin and flesh were swollen, and her condition became more and more serious. She died the next day. The Liuhe County Health Center in Northern Jiangsu District also had six patients who should not have died because they bought fake medicines from the奸商 Xia Dexiang. Ruan Guansan's only son and Qu Shaoqing's uncle, residents of Wuhan City, were also killed by Xiang Wenbin, a奸商 in a traditional Chinese medicine shop, using fake medicines. These sporadic death figures are only a part of what has been revealed in various places. As for how many people in the vast rural areas and small towns have died from taking the fake and bad medicines of the奸商, it is not known. These facts have eloquently demonstrated that if the bourgeoisie is allowed to continue its offensive, the lives and health of the people cannot be guaranteed.

    药业奸商谋财害命的罪行
    林洪
    贪婪的资产阶级的违法分子，早就把人民的生命当作了牟取暴利的对象。继奸商王康年骗取志愿军的购药巨款，奸商李寅廷用烂棉花作救急包暗害志愿军的事件之后，在北京、天津、上海、南京、武汉、西安、沈阳、广州、济南、太原、杭州、苏州、扬州、无锡、青岛、蚌埠、贵阳、鞍山……几乎每一个大、中城市都揭发了中、西药业奸商不顾人民健康制造和贩卖假药、坏药的严重罪行。这些血淋淋的事实再一次说明了资产阶级的丑恶本质。他们不只是一般的损人利己，而是为了谋财可以害命的。
    这些药店的奸商坑害人民、诈骗钱财的方法，除了最常见的抬高药品价格，暴利达到几倍、几十倍，甚至一两百倍以外，最阴险最毒辣的有以下几种：
    第一、制造药品时偷工减料，掺水掺杂，以次货当好货用，减低药品的效力，甚至引起很大的副作用。许多中药店出卖的牛黄清心丸中根本没有牛黄；羚翘解毒丸中根本没有羚羊角；制造乳糖皮先，根本不用乳糖，而以糖粉代替，皮先也只是搁一点就算。他们将象贝掺入川贝中（川贝比象贝贵数十倍）；将广角稍为加工，当成每两价值二百多万元的犀角和羚羊角，每两可获暴利一百九十多万元。根据沈阳市卫生局和中药审查委员会去年年底重点检查十五家中药店的结果，证明没有一家不贩卖假药，不偷工减料。最严重的，偷工减料达百分之六十以上，最少的也在百分之三十以上。而减料药品，一般都是贵重的麝香、羚羊角、人参等。这些贵重药品，常常由药店经理自己保管，在配制药品时，他们又以“家传秘方”为借口，不把分量向工人宣布，以便达到减料的目的。在新药业中，这些恶劣的行为同样地严重存在着。他们制造葡萄糖针，以白沙糖代葡萄糖，以食盐代盐酸，以茶叶磨成粉，轧成片子，当作洋地黄叶末片，在亚林臭药水中掺水，在消发地亚净粉中掺消治龙，等等。此外，上海、杭州等地还发现奸商制造和出售的成分不足的药品有宝塔糖、消治龙、消发地亚净、盘尼西林、奎宁和阿司匹林等。如杭州惠尔康药房出卖的奎宁丸，标明每粒含奎宁零点一三克，实际上只有零点零一三三克，其余都是淀粉或面粉。同春药房的滴滴涕药粉，本来说明纯度是百分之一百，实际只含有百分之二十五。民生药厂出售的专治妇女子宫出血等止血用的麦角酊，其中麦角流浸膏的成分应为四分之一，而这个药厂只用二十分之一，不知道害死了多少妇女。可拉明是救命用的强心剂，每瓶进价三十万元，这个药厂在给病人配方时用水把药冲淡，每瓶还卖七百万元。这些奸商用这种恶劣的手段所得到的非法利润是骇人听闻的。如南京市培和药厂奸商周瑞芳，用二千四百磅乳糖粉稍加其他成分，轧成二百多万片消治龙、消发灭定、肠胃消炎片等成分不足的假药，所牟取的暴利在十亿元以上。杭州市民生药厂老板周师洛，在制造“矽炭银”时，用食盐代替
    “盐酸”、糠炭代替牛血等偷工减料的办法，两年来仅这一种药品就获得非法利润八亿多元。此外在替病家配方时，许多药店和医生勾结，病人看病后一定要到医生指定的药房去配药。而药房则根本不给够量的药。或以次药顶替好药。这样取得的非法利润，药房拿出一部分送给医生，作为回扣。根据店员揭发的材料，一般中药店在配方时减料是普遍现象，而减料的程度往往达到百分之五十左右甚至百分之七十。
    第二、冒牌顶替。许多奸商为了使他们所制造的成分不足、成色不好的药品能够顺利卖出，骗取非法利润，常常把坏药品伪装成进口货；如果是中药，一般是在包装上盖上个北京某某堂的戳子。有的奸商把坏的盘尼西林，放在外国某某药厂出品的盘尼西林空瓶里，抬高几倍价格出售。有的把不能治咳嗽的纯净拍拉托灌进专治咳嗽的几怪拍拉托空瓶里。根据无锡市的初步统计，解放两年多来，市面上出现过的冒充日本药厂出品的假药有十六种，冒充德国药厂出品的有十九种，冒充其他牌子的有二十二种，都是一些常用的药品。
    还有许多奸商，把性质相同但功效大有区别的消发灭定当消治龙出售，把消治龙当消发地亚净出售。原因是这些奸商只看见消发地亚净卖一千八百元一片，消发灭定仅卖三百元一片，消治龙卖七百元一片。本来，消发地亚净一般是给儿童治肺炎用的，它的副作用小，而消发灭定和消治龙不但效力小，并且有较大的副作用。这种骗人的罪恶勾当，无锡全市六十三家药房都干过。扬州市奸商吴彭龄和王正衷，一次就以十三万片消发灭定冒充消治龙出卖。广州市华南药房卖给某军事机关的七十四亿元的药品中，全部是冒牌货，或质量恶劣而又高于市价的药品。初步统计，国家损失在十五亿元以上。
    在中药业里，这种极端恶劣的欺骗作风也到处存在。一般都是把次货、坏货或分量不足的药品盖上一个假戳子，就到处批发出售。如青岛市永乐堂中药店，就把分量不够的羚翘解毒丸、牛肉熬成的鹿胎膏以及猪骨头造成的虎骨酒等，统统盖上一个北京什么堂号的戳记。北京市庆仁堂、千芝堂等国药店的奸商，甚至以自来水冒充用羚羊角、犀角和雪水泡制成的金汁水。
    第三、出卖失效药品，制售假药和毒品。他们售卖失效药品的方法是多种多样的，除直接出卖失效药品以外，一般都采取了极卑鄙的欺骗手段，在商标的有效期限上打主意。有的把盖有限期印鉴的壳子拆掉，或者把过期的瓶签撕下，再把已经用过而未到期的空瓶的瓶签贴上；有的把盖有年月日的字样褪掉；有的在失效药品上贴上自己私印的商标纸。此外还有一种办法，就是把失效药品拿来，稍稍加工，仍然当好药出卖。总之，为了赚钱，他们什么下流的办法都想得出来。许多奸商不但出卖自己的过期药品，而且还专门到市场去收买过期失效的药品。杭州市惠尔康药房的老板杨春华，就曾派人到上海专门收购一切过期失效的盘尼西林针药，卖给广济医院。根据二十个月的初步统计，杨春华出卖的这种针药达一万二千瓶以上。奸商们出售的失效药品不仅是一般的药品，有许多还是救治急症的药品，如六○六、盘尼西林、狂犬病疫苗、破伤风疫苗等。盘尼西林是专治急性肺炎、急性脑膜炎等病的。病人如果服了失效的盘尼西林，必然要造成严重的后果。
    在制造和出售假药方面，有用酵母片伪造美尔维他命，用淀粉伪造BK奎宁丸，以及伪造盘尼西林、消治龙和消发地亚净的；有用食盐和自来水制造各种眼药的；有制造质量不纯、含有毒性的破伤风血清的。这些假药，奸商们都是大量制造，四处推销。仅天津奸商阎和纯，已被查出的私造的破伤风血清即达一万三千多针。上海奸商马聚三被捕时，在他那里查出的假药有西利汞一万多针，里面是未经消毒的士的年；圣露斯锑新三千多针，里面是未经消毒的蒸馏水，还有类似的很多假药。至于公然漠视政府法令，私造和私售违禁品，以毒害人民的精神和肉体，也是药店奸商常干的罪恶勾当。各地已经查获奸商私售的违禁品或毒品有吗啡针、可待因、雅片酊等等。
    奸商们为了大量盗骗国家资财、坑害人民，还用了种种卑鄙无耻的手段，把公营医药卫生机关和企业的干部拉下水，或者直接派遣坐探掌握重要部门，以包庇他们的犯罪行为，使假药、坏药在检验时容易通过，而且还和贪污分子共同大量盗窃国家的医药器材，盗窃国家经济情报，操纵垄断医药市场，更大量地杀害人民。如杭州市民生药厂，人民政府曾极力加以扶持。一九五○年这个厂的营业清淡，浙江省人民政府卫生厅接受这个厂的请求，将这个厂的制造玻璃机械部分和浙江人民医药公司合营，成立了公私合营的民生药厂和人民医药公司第二制造厂、民生药厂就这样在国营企业的扶植下，营业日渐好转，营业额超过解放前任何一年。但是这个厂的总经理周师洛却以怨报德，隐匿了他厂里的官僚资本十亿多元和日寇留下的大批机器，并且还派遣民生药厂发行所同春药房营业部主任俞荣鉴等三人打入人民医药公司。俞荣鉴在人民医药公司窃据了供应股副股长的职位，大量代民生药厂推销各种假药和坏药。一年多的销货总值约达八亿多元，使民生公司成为人民医药公司最大的主顾。公司本身制造的许多药品如葡萄糖、氯化钙等都卖不出去。奸商周师洛还利用俞荣鉴刺探内部情报，投机倒把。奸商周师洛还向其他机关和公营企业进攻，在将近二十多个单位中，都有些工作人员被他所腐蚀。根据他自己的不可靠的口供，利用这种阴险毒辣手段所取得的非法利润是很大的，仅一九五一年就获得毛利二十八亿元。青岛安裕药房老板赵璞之，混入公营人民药房当上副经理后，马上纠集了几家奸商成立了
    一个罗灵大药房，由他任董事长。赵璞之等奸商除经常以罗灵大药房的名义低价套购人民药房的药物器材，垄断全市各公立医院、诊疗所所需的药品等外，更恶毒的是去年青岛流行白喉症，各医院、诊疗所急需白喉抗毒素时，他竟胆敢把人民药房在上海采购的药品压下不发，而先给罗灵大药房寄去
    一批，让他们高价出售窃取暴利。直到白喉流行已过，才把人民药房的药品寄回，而这些药品已经沉淀，不能应用。鞍山健宁西药房奸商陈德山，在一九五○年勾结天津奸商三寿西药房的经理等打进了公营天津医药公司，垄断了这个公司和东北、上海、广州、天津等地的医药器材的贸易，一年内牟取暴利二百亿元。沈阳华东药房经理马永山、张德恒和上海永安医疗器材公司经理汤贤，在收买了抚顺矿务局医院药局部主任顾鹏志后，卖给这个矿务局医院的器材都是破破烂烂的，有许多根本不能使用。如价值四十多亿元的X光机，只能照手部，不能透视肺部和腰椎；价值八亿多元的三架显微镜，镜头是另配的，零件是旧的，根本不能用；价值四亿多元的六个冰箱，原“保证”使用两年，结果一天也不能用；价值四亿六千万元的一把电刀，刀是锈的；一台生锈的九九式外科器械，电镀一下就充新的。三年来这个矿务局的医院经过贪污分子顾鹏志支出的三百亿元医药器材费中，差不多有一半被马永山等几个奸商盗窃去了。这些坏的、假的或不合规格的医疗器材对于病人的生命和健康有着很大的危害性。只要举出这样一个例子就可以说明：一九五○年抚顺市小孩害麻疹的很多，抚顺矿务局医院因为在奸商那里买的血球计算器不准确，不能及时进行有效治疗，结果增加了小孩的死亡率。
    解放三年以来，由于各地奸商出卖假药、坏药、毒药，操纵垄断医药市场，不知道已经害死了多少人命，损害了多少人的健康。南京市立第一医院，用奸商周瑞芳的假山道年给病人打蛔虫，不仅打不下虫子，反而使病人头昏胃痛；患心脏病的人吃了他制造的假毛地黄，不但心跳速度没有减慢，反而加快。据现已查明的，一九五○年夏天，在南京市立第一医院医治痢疾和肺炎的十六个儿童，都因为服了他伪造的消炎片和已失效的盘尼西林而死亡。南京市生产教养院也因为采用他的假药的结果，有二百零九个病人死亡。南京另一卖假药的奸商张立言，现已查明十四个机关企业中有二十六个人被他活活害死。如华东军区医院护士谢敏求害痢疾，服了张立言的假消炎片一百多粒，终无效果，拖延不治而死。永利宁厂职员强耀先的女儿害肺炎，一天打了张立言的失效盘尼西林六针，皮肉都打肿了，而病势越来越重，第二天就死了。苏北区六合县卫生院也因买了奸商夏德祥的假药，有六个不应死的病人都因而死亡。武汉市居民阮冠三的独子和屈少卿的叔父，也是被中药店奸商向文彬用假药害死的。这一些零星的死亡数字，只是各地已揭发出来的一部分，至于广大农村和小城镇的人民因服了奸商的假药、坏药而致死的，则不知道还有多少。这些事实已雄辩地说明了，如果听任资产阶级的进攻继续下去，人民的生命和健康是得不到保障的。
