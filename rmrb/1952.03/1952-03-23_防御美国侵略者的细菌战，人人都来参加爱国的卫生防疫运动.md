The scope of the American aggressors' germ warfare is expanding. Besides continually dropping germs in Korea, they have also dropped them in many places in Northeast China and the Qingdao area of Shandong. The enemy does this shameful thing secretly. They often fly at high altitudes and drop things down under cover of darkness. Therefore, the people in all parts of the country must be vigilant and prepare early. Don't think, "We're far away from Korea, there's nothing here." Only if we prepare well can there truly be "nothing here."

Today, we have the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government, and a large number of patriotic medical and health workers. Our people are conscious and organized, so we have the full conditions and strength to defeat the American imperialists' germ warfare.

In order to defeat the American aggressors' germ warfare, in addition to taking emergency epidemic prevention measures in those places where enemy planes have been found to have dropped germ-carrying insects, cities, villages, organs, factories, and schools across the country must carry out patriotic health and epidemic prevention campaigns to prepare for defense against germ warfare.

What specific work should be done in this movement?

First, quickly organize and establish health and epidemic prevention organizations. Where there are already grassroots health organizations, they should be reorganized and their work strengthened. All levels of epidemic prevention organizations should elect capable leaders, assign them certain tasks, and recommend activists to participate in epidemic prevention training classes. Everyone should take some time to learn epidemic prevention knowledge, pay close attention to the activities of enemy planes, and prevent counter-revolutionaries from poisoning and spreading rumors. If you find that the enemy has dropped something or discover an epidemic, you should report it to your superiors as soon as possible.

Second, maintain environmental cleanliness. Everyone should take action, and every household should mobilize to thoroughly clean all streets and houses. Then, divide them into sections and assign specific people to be responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of every corner. After doing this, the poisonous insects dropped by enemy planes will have nowhere to hide and will be easy to eradicate.

Third, vigorously capture and eliminate pests. Remove sewage and garbage, renovate manure pits, and try to prevent them from breeding mosquitoes and flies. Kill mosquitoes and flies as soon as they are found. Get rid of bedbugs, lice, and fleas as well. Because the enemy uses these insects to spread germs. If we eliminate the existing pests, it will be easier to eradicate the insects dropped by the enemy, and we can prevent them from spreading the germs dropped by the enemy. In addition, everyone should block rat holes and catch rats frequently. Because the fleas on rats are the medium for transmitting plague. In rural areas, livestock pens should also be cleaned, and lice and fleas on livestock should be removed. Because the enemy may also drop germs to kill livestock.

Fourth, pay attention to food hygiene and improve your health. Some of the germs spread by the enemy are transmitted to people through the water we drink and the food we eat. Therefore, everyone should develop the habit of not drinking raw water. Do not let flies crawl on stored food. Restaurants and food vendors should accept the guidance of health and epidemic prevention agencies and not sell unsanitary food. In addition, everyone should bathe frequently, change clothes frequently, and pay attention to their health. The healthier you are, the greater your resistance to germs.

Fifth, everyone should respond to the call of the People's Government and go to health agencies to get vaccinated and inoculated. Everyone knows that vaccination can prevent smallpox. However, many people think that it is enough to be vaccinated only once in a lifetime, which is not correct. Because being vaccinated only provides immunity for a certain number of years. Therefore, all children under the age of six and those who have not been vaccinated in the past three years should be vaccinated. The principle of getting vaccinated is the same as that of getting vaccinated. Getting vaccinated against a certain disease can increase our body's resistance to a certain bacteria. But both vaccination and inoculation should be carried out as soon as possible. Because it usually takes about two weeks for immunity to develop after being vaccinated. If you wait until you are infected with bacteria before getting vaccinated, it will be too late. In addition, although the body's resistance is strengthened after being vaccinated or inoculated, it is not absolutely immune. Therefore, after everyone is vaccinated or inoculated, they should not relax their attention to hygiene and other relevant epidemic prevention matters. Don't think that you are insured after getting vaccinated and become careless.

As the saying goes: "Prevention is better than cure." The sooner and better we do the work of defending against the American aggressors' germ warfare, the greater our chances of victory. To smash the American aggressors' germ warfare, we must rely on the strength of everyone, in addition to the efforts of health workers. In the past, the People's Government relied on the strength of the masses and won many victories in epidemic prevention work. Cholera, which has been prevalent in our country for many years, has been completely eliminated since 1949. In three years, not a single patient with true cholera has been found in the country. The plague that occurred in Chahar League in 1949 was also quickly extinguished by us. Therefore, everyone should not underestimate our own strength, nor should they think that "small things" such as sweeping garbage and swatting flies are not worth paying attention to. The germ warfare waged by the American devils this time is the largest in human history. If we defeat it, we will not only protect ourselves, but also increase the security of the people all over the world. Let everyone in the country, men, women, old and young, participate in the patriotic health and epidemic prevention movement!

### 防御美国侵略者的细菌战，人人都来参加爱国的卫生防疫运动

    防御美国侵略者的细菌战，人人都来参加爱国的卫生防疫运动
    美国侵略者进行细菌战的范围越来越扩大了。他们除了在朝鲜继续不断地撒下细菌以外，在我国东北的很多地方和山东青岛地区也撒了。敌人干这种见不得人的事，常常是偷偷摸摸干的。他们每每趁着天黑，飞在高空往下投。所以，全国各地方的人民都要提高警惕，早作防备。千万不要以为“我们这儿离朝鲜远得很，没有啥。”只有我们防备得好，才能真正“没有啥”。
    今天，我们有毛主席、共产党和人民政府的正确领导，有大批爱国的医药卫生工作人员，我们全国人民都是有觉悟、有组织的，所以我们有充分的条件和力量可以打败美国鬼子的细菌战。
    为了击败美国侵略者的细菌战，除了那些已经发现敌机投下带菌毒虫的地方，应该采取紧急的防疫措施之外，全国各地的城市、农村、机关、工厂、学校，都要开展爱国的卫生防疫运动，作好防御细菌战的准备工作。
    在这个运动里，应该做些什么具体的工作呢？
    第一，赶快组织起来，建立卫生防疫机构。原来有了基层卫生组织的地方，则要整顿组织，加强工作。各级防疫组织都要选出有能力的领导人，分工担负一定的工作。并推选积极分子去参加防疫训练班的学习。每一个人都要抽一定的时间学习防疫常识，时刻注意监视敌机的活动，并防止反革命分子放毒、造谣。发现敌人投下东西和发现疫情时，要赶快向上级报告。
    第二，保持环境的清洁。人人动手、户户动员，把所有街道房屋来一次彻底的大扫除。然后分片、分段，指定专人负责，保持各个角落经常清洁。这样做了之后，敌机撒下的毒虫就无处躲藏，容易扑灭。
    第三，大力捕灭害虫。清除污水和垃圾，改造粪坑，尽量不让它滋生蚊子和苍蝇，发现蚊子苍蝇时赶快捕杀。有臭虫、虱子、跳蚤的，也要想法除净。因为敌人就是利用这些虫子来散播细菌的。我们把原有的害虫消灭了，在扑灭敌人投下的虫子时方便，而且可以防止它们把敌人撒下的细菌传播开来。另外，大家还要堵塞鼠洞，勤捉老鼠。因为老鼠身上的跳蚤，是传染鼠疫的媒介。在农村里，还要把牲口圈弄干净，除掉家畜身上的虱子和跳蚤。因为敌人也可能投下杀害牲畜的细菌。
    第四，注意饮食卫生，增进身体健康。敌人撒布的细菌，有一些是通过我们喝的水和吃的东西来传到人身上的。所以我们大家都要养成不喝生水的习惯。储藏饭菜不要让苍蝇去爬。饭菜馆和卖吃食的摊贩，应该接受卫生防疫机关的指导，不出卖不卫生的东西。另外，大家要常洗澡，勤换衣服，注意身体健康。身体越健康，抵抗细菌毒害的力量也越大。
    第五，大家都要响应人民政府的号召，到卫生机关去种痘和打防疫针。种痘能够预防天花，这是大家都知道的。可是有很多人以为一生只要种了一次痘就够了，这是不对的。因为种一次痘只有在一定的年限内有免疫力。所以，凡是六岁以下的小孩和三年之内没有种过痘的人，都应该去种痘。打防疫针的道理和种痘相同。我们打了对某种病的防疫针，就能增加我们的身体对某种病菌的抵抗力。但无论种痘和打防疫针，都要尽快进行。因为打针之后一般都要经过两个礼拜左右才能发生免疫力。如果等到传染上细菌之后才去打，就会来不及了。另外，种了痘或打了针之后，身体的抵抗力虽然加强了，但并不能绝对免疫。所以大家种了痘、打了针之后，对于卫生清洁和其他有关防疫方面应该注意的事，一点也不要放松。不要以为打了针就保了险了，因而麻痹大意起来。
    俗语说：“有备无患”。我们防御美国侵略者的细菌战的工作，越做得早、越做得好，胜利的把握也越大。我们要粉碎美国侵略者的细菌战，除了要卫生人员的努力之外，还要依靠大家的力量。人民政府过去依靠群众的力量，在防疫工作上打了很多胜仗。历年来在我国流行的霍乱，从一九四九年起全部被消灭了。三年中，全国没有发现过一个患真性霍乱的病人。一九四九年察盟发生鼠疫，也是很快就被我们扑灭了。所以大家不要看小了我们自己的
    力量，也不要以为扫垃圾、打苍蝇这样的“小事”不值得注意。美国鬼子这次进行的细菌战是人类历史上规模最大的一次，我们把它打败了，不独保卫了我们自己，也给全世界人民的安全增加了保障。全国的每一个人，男女老少，都来参加爱国的卫生防疫运动吧！
