Problems in the State-Owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory's Promotion of Advanced Experience and Cultivation of Model Workers
The Chinese Communist Party North China Textile Administration Bureau Committee

After the People's Daily criticized the State-Owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory (hereinafter referred to as No. 2 Factory) for its error of not valuing workers' advanced experience last October, we conducted an inspection of the No. 2 Factory's leadership work to help it thoroughly correct its mistakes. During the inspection, we found that the leading cadres of the No. 2 Factory did indeed have many problems in the work of cultivating advanced producers and summarizing and promoting advanced experience.

Wang Deshan, a weaver in the No. 2 Factory, was a representative of Tianjin at the National Congress of Laboring People. In the two years since the liberation of Tianjin, he has never produced a single piece of substandard cloth. However, in the work shift where Wang Deshan worked, other workers often produced more than ten or even dozens of pieces of substandard cloth every day, and later even as many as about a thousand pieces. Obviously, if the leading cadres of the No. 2 Factory had effectively summarized and promoted Wang Deshan's operating experience, this situation would have greatly improved.

Since last spring, the leading cadres of the No. 2 Factory began to pay attention to summarizing Wang Deshan's work method. However, some cadres still believed that Wang Deshan's work method was nothing more than "energy, spirit, and vigor" and "a good work attitude, always working with enthusiasm," and that there was nothing remarkable about it technically. Some even thought that Wang Deshan's work method was not as good as others. The leading cadres of the No. 2 Factory did not give timely criticism and education to this kind of erroneous thinking. Therefore, although Wang Deshan's work method was measured twice, there were no results.

Later, the North China Textile Administration Bureau repeatedly instructed the No. 2 Factory to summarize and promote Wang Deshan's work method. However, the leading cadres of the No. 2 Factory mistakenly planned to transfer him to management work, wanting to "maintain" the glory of Wang Deshan as a model worker in this way. Last autumn, all enterprises in Tianjin were universally learning the Kovalev work method. Wang Deshan summarized his own experience and the experience of several people in his group and promoted it within the group. Later, although the North China Textile Administration Bureau's work team helped the No. 2 Factory summarize Wang Deshan's experience again, the result was only a summary of a "three diligences work method."

The Ministry of Textile Industry and the National Committee of the Textile Trade Union under the Central People's Government criticized the erroneous "three diligences and three quicks" method in summarizing the Hao Jianxiu work method. After this, the leading cadres of the No. 2 Factory finally assigned someone to study and summarize Wang Deshan's work method. However, because the leading cadres were busy with administrative work, this summary was still not done well. It was not until October, when the Ministry of Textile Industry sent people to the No. 2 Factory to assist in the measurement, that this situation underwent a fundamental change.

The situation of not valuing advanced experience is not accidental in the No. 2 Factory. Wang Shulan, a roving frame operator in the spinning workshop (a model worker in Tianjin), only produces two or three liang of leather roller flowers per day, at most half a pound (the leather roller flowers of general spinning workers are one to two pounds). However, the leading cadres of the No. 2 Factory have never measured or analyzed Wang Shulan's work method. Zhang Xiulan (model worker) in the cone winding workshop has a high output, being able to wind 180 to 190 skeins per day (the quota at that time was 147 skeins), and has never produced a bad spindle. The workshop administrator also made a measurement of her work method once; however, after the measurement, he only said "fast joining" and then there was no follow-up.

Why do the leading cadres of the No. 2 Factory not value advanced experience so much?

First, their understanding of the purpose of cultivating model workers is vague. Since the No. 2 Factory launched a labor competition in May, June, and July 1950, many model workers have emerged in the factory. The leading cadres of the No. 2 Factory also paid attention to the cultivation of model workers and did some "summarizing experience" work. However, the leading cadres of the No. 2 Factory did not have a clear idea of why they should cultivate model workers. They often did cultivation work in order to maintain the individual "glory" and "achievements" of the model workers. In this way, they inevitably neglected the important role of the advanced experience of model workers in improving technology, increasing production efficiency, and improving enterprise management; they could not seriously conduct a scientific summary of the advanced experience of model workers and promote it. Therefore, after the model workers of the No. 2 Factory were selected, most of them were praised for a while and then disappeared.

Second, the leading cadres of the No. 2 Factory have a tendency of bureaucratism in their work methods. Although they also wanted to summarize and promote advanced experience, in fact, they were entangled in the circle of administration all day long and could not extricate themselves. The leading cadres of the No. 2 Factory once reviewed and said: "We are busy all day long, sending off and welcoming; work is done with momentum at the beginning but no follow-up, there is arrangement but no inspection; in various movements, the masses have already been mobilized, but we do not have a clear goal; and there is no conclusion after the movement is over." Leading cadres are often busy with trivial administrative work, so their sense of fresh things becomes less and less sensitive, and they cannot criticize and educate the conservative ideas of technical personnel in a timely manner. When workers put forward rationalization proposals, the leading cadres do not value them. When workers urge them, they always say "the budget has not been approved"; or they just report the rationalization proposal to the higher level and consider it done.

The Party's General Branch Committee and the administrative leaders of the No. 2 Factory should thoroughly change their leadership thinking and leadership style, and implement the view of relying on the working class to run enterprises well into every specific task.

    国营天津第二棉纺织厂推广先进经验和培养劳动模范工作中的问题
    中共华北纺织管理局委员会
    去年十月人民日报对国营天津第二棉纺织厂（以下简称二厂）不重视工人先进经验的错误进行了批评以后，为了帮助二厂彻底改正错误，我们曾对二厂的领导工作进行了一次检查。在检查中，我们发现二厂的领导干部在培养先进生产者和总结、推广先进经验的工作中确实是有很多问题的。
    二厂织布工人王德山，是一九五零年天津市出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表。天津解放以后的两年多中，他从来没有出过一匹次布。但是在王德山所在的工作班内，别的工人每天出的次布，常有十多匹以至几十匹，后来甚至多至一千匹左右。很明显的，假如二厂的领导干部很好地总结和推广了王德山的操作经验，这种情况就会有很大的改进。
    去年春天以来，二厂的领导干部开始注意总结王德山的工作法。但部分干部还认为王德山的工作法不过是“精、气、神”和“劳动态度好，干活总是一股子劲”而已，在技术上并没有什么了不起。有的甚至认为王德山的工作法还不如别人的好。对于这种错误思想，二厂的领导干部没有及时地给以批评教育。因此对于王德山的工作法虽然前后测定了两次，但是毫无结果。
    以后，华北纺织管理局曾一再指示二厂总结和推广王德山的工作法。但是二厂的领导干部却错误地打算调他做管理工作，想以这种方法“保持”王德山的劳动模范的光荣。去年秋季，天津市各企业单位普遍地学习郭瓦廖夫工作法。王德山把自己和本组几个人的经验作了一次总结，并在小组内加以推广。以后华北纺织管理局工作组虽然又帮助二厂把王德山的经验总结了一次，结果，只总结出一个“三勤工作法”。
    中央人民政府纺织工业部和纺织工会全国委员会在总结郝建秀工作法中，批判了“三勤三快”的错误的方法。在这以后，二厂领导干部才派专人研究总结王德山的工作法。但是由于领导干部忙于事务工作，这次总结还是没有做好。直到十月间，中央纺织工业部派人到二厂协助进行测定时，这种情况才有了根本的转变。
    不重视先进经验的情况在二厂不是偶然的。细纱间挡车工王淑兰（天津市的劳动模范）每天只出二、三两皮辊花，最多不过出半磅（一般细纱工人的皮辊花有一磅到两磅的）。但二厂领导干部却从没有测定和分析过王淑兰的工作法。筒摇间张秀兰（劳动模范）的产量很高，每天能打一百八十绞至一百九十绞（当时定额为一百四十七绞），并且从来没有出过坏轴。车间管理员也曾对她的工作法作过一次测定；但是测定后只说了一声“接头快”，以后就没有下文了。
    为什么二厂的领导干部这样不重视先进经验呢？
    第一、他们对于培养劳动模范的目的认识模糊。从一九五零年五、六、七月二厂发动劳动竞赛以来，厂里曾出现了不少劳动模范。二厂的领导干部也曾经注意了对劳动模范的培养，并作了一些“总结经验”的工作。但是对于为什么要培养劳动模范，二厂领导干部并没有明确的思想。他们常常是为了保持劳动模范个人的“光荣”和“成绩”而去做培养工作。这样他们也就必然忽视了劳动模范的先进经验对于改进技术提高生产效率和改进企业管理的重要作用；他们也就不可能认真地对劳动模范的先进经验进行科学的总结，并把它推广。因此，二厂的劳动模范被选出以后，大多是传颂一时，而后消声敛迹。
    第二、二厂的领导干部在工作方法上有事务主义的倾向。虽然他们也想总结和推广先进经验，但事实上他们却整天纠缠在事务的圈子里而不能自拔。二厂的领导干部曾经检讨说：“我们整天忙忙碌碌，送往迎来；工作干起来有前劲没后劲，有布置没检查；在各种运动中，群众已经动起来了，我们还没有明确的目标；运动过去了也没有收场。”领导干部经常忙于琐碎的事务工作，对新鲜事物的感觉就越来越不锐敏了，对于技术人员的保守思想也就不能及时地进行批判教育。工人提了合理化建议，领导干部并不重视。工人催问时，他们总说“预算没批下来”；或者是把合理化建议报到上级去就算完事。
    二厂党的总支委员会和行政领导干部应该彻底转变领导思想和领导作风，把依靠工人阶级办好企业的观点贯彻到每一件具体工作中去。
