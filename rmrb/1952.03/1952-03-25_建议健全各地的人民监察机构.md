    Suggest Strengthening People's Supervision Organs in Various Regions

    Editor: Since the anti-corruption campaign was launched throughout the country, a large number of embezzlers, wasters, and bureaucrats have been exposed. We know that the reason why corruption and waste are so serious is precisely the result of the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on the working class. However, the failure of the people's supervisory organs in some places to be soundly established and to fully play their role in preventing problems before they occur is also an important reason for the formation of this phenomenon. Take Leshan County in our Southern Sichuan District as an example. The People's Supervisory Committee was established there in May of last year. However, due to the leadership's lack of attention to supervision work, the supervisory body has become a mere formality. For the past six months, not even a single full-time cadre has been assigned. The Supervisory Committee only passively handles matters after they occur, without proactively and comprehensively carrying out its work, and is unable to play its due role.

    In order to consolidate the results of the anti-corruption campaign, I suggest that places where people's supervisory organs have not been established should establish them quickly; those with unsound organizations should be rectified or supplemented; and the large number of activists who have emerged in the anti-corruption campaign should be developed into people's supervision correspondents. We must enable the people's supervisory organs to play their due role, so that embezzlers, wasters, and bureaucrats will have no place to stand.

    建议健全各地的人民监察机构
    编辑同志：自从反贪污运动在全国各地展开以来，贪污、浪费和官僚主义分子已被大量检举出来。我们知道，贪污、浪费现象所以这样严重，正是资产阶级向工人阶级猖狂进攻的结果。但是，某些地方的人民监察机关，没有健全起来并充分发挥作用，以防患于未然，也是形成这种现象的一个重要原因。拿我们川南区乐山县来说，人民监察委员会在去年五月间就成立了。但由于领导方面对监察工作不重视，致使监察机构流于形式，半年以来，一个专职干部也没有配备。监察委员会只是被动地在事情发生以后，才被动地处理一下，而没有主动地、全面地展开工作，不能发挥应有的作用。
    为了巩固反贪污运动的成果，我建议没有设立人民监察机构的地方，应该迅速设立；机构不健全的，应该加以整顿或充实；把反贪污运动中涌现出来的大批积极分子，发展为人民监察通讯员。我们必须使人民监察机构发挥应有的作用，使贪污、浪费和官僚主义分子永无立锥之地。
