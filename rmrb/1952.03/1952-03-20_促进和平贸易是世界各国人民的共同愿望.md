    Promoting Peaceful Trade is the Common Aspiration of People All Over the World

    The International Economic Conference will be held in Moscow on April 3rd. This conference is convened to promote economic cooperation among countries around the world, to improve the living conditions of people in various countries, and to safeguard the cause of world peace. The preparation of this conference has attracted increasing attention and response from the business and opinion circles of various countries. Industrial, trade, and cooperative organizations in China, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries, economic scholars in India, business figures in Japan, industrialists in Britain and France, fishery owners in Norway, and merchants in Brazil, as well as the broad masses of people in various countries, all place great hopes on this conference.
    When commenting on the significance of this conference, newspapers of various countries particularly emphasized its contribution to promoting international economic cooperation and safeguarding the cause of world peace. "Magyar Nemzet" of Hungary pointed out that this conference is the most important event in the world peace movement. The Italian magazine "Economic News" has continuously published commentaries and reports on the International Economic Conference in recent months. This magazine emphasized that the Moscow conference is a firm and significant step on the road to economic prosperity under conditions of world peace, and "this conference should be regarded as the first step in further efforts to improve peaceful economic cooperation among countries and develop economic relations among countries." The French bourgeois newspaper "Paris Radical News" also acknowledged that the International Economic Conference can promote the development of trade between the East and the West, and the development of this trade "will allow armed policies to give way to peaceful economic policies."
    The economic development of our country, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries, and the improvement of the people's living standards, not only provide these countries with abundant materials to export, but also require the import of goods from other countries. Therefore, we are happy to trade with various capitalist countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the Chinese Preparatory Committee for the International Economic Conference, said: "The Chinese people love peace and are willing to establish and develop commercial and trade relations with the governments and peoples of all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." Nesterov, Chairman of the Soviet Chamber of Commerce, wrote in "New Times" magazine discussing the issue of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and other countries: The Soviet Union has become a powerful industrial country, using the latest achievements of science and technology, and is able to manufacture various types of machines and instruments. This is a solid foundation for expanding commercial cooperation with other countries. The Soviet Union is also a major country producing grain and a wide variety of raw materials. The Soviet Union has abundant goods to export, and is also a consumer of different kinds of manufactured goods and raw materials. All this creates good conditions for the development of trade between the Soviet Union and various capitalist countries in Europe and America. The Dutch business newspaper "Algemeen Dagblad" pointed out on January 6th of this year: "If Western European countries want to sell their goods and make profits, they should trade with Eastern Europe and the People's Republic of China. We must remember that not only China, but also other Asian countries, like Eastern European countries, are good customers and suppliers of raw materials." The American "Compass" newspaper said on December 8th of last year: The reason why the American business community is eager to start negotiations with the Soviet Union is not only because the expansion of armaments plan that the United States will implement in the next two years cannot save the domestic economic recession, but also because they have understood the great economic achievements of the Soviet Union.
    Our country, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries have superior conditions for restoring and developing East-West trade, and the International Economic Conference will provide a good opportunity to discuss the possibility of industrialists and businessmen in capitalist countries establishing contacts with economic and trade organizations in China, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries. Business and opinion circles in various capitalist countries have been paying attention to this good opportunity. The Belgian economic and financial newspaper "La Libre Belgique" attaches great importance to the International Economic Conference. This newspaper believes that the time has come to strengthen trade relations between the East and the West. Even the American "New York Times" had to admit that this conference is a great opportunity to expand international trade.
    Although "Voice of America" arbitrarily said that Eastern trade is meaningless to the West, many industrialists, businessmen, and opinion circles in the West still see the importance of trade with the East. This importance is linked to the International Economic Conference. The British weekly "New Central European Observer" emphasized that Western Europe cannot survive without trade with the East. An article published by former British Trade Minister Shawcross in the November issue of "United Nations World" magazine more forcefully refuted the shameless lies of "Voice of America." He cited the figures of British trade with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries in 1950 to illustrate that it is necessary for the West to trade with the East. Shawcross wrote:
    "Our position on the issue of East-West trade is completely different from that of the United States, because this trade is very important to us." Many industrialists and businessmen in Western Europe have seen that expanding international trade is the best way to alleviate the domestic economic crisis.
    The policy of U.S. imperialism to prevent its vassal states from trading with our country, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries has seriously damaged the interests of various capitalist countries and the United States itself. Even American bourgeois political commentator Lippmann had to acknowledge this fact in the "New York Herald Tribune." As the opening date of the International Economic Conference approaches, the business and opinion circles of capitalist countries are expressing increasingly strong dissatisfaction with the U.S. policy of hindering international trade. The French "Liberation" newspaper published an article on March 4th, saying: "For many manufacturers (in Western Europe), especially for French manufacturers, the facts are already clearly in front of them: trade with the East is today a 'lifeline'. Only trade with the East can avoid the factory closures and production cuts that have already occurred in some industries - such as the textile industry." The Dusseldorf "Handelsblatt" in West Germany wrote an article opposing the United States' control and obstruction of West Germany's trade with people's democratic countries and the German Democratic Republic. The Dutch newspaper "Het Vaderland" expressed particular indignation at the United States' forcing Dutch trading companies to purchase expensive and low-quality American coal. The Cuban economist Torras wrote in "Noticias de Hoy" that the International Economic Conference is particularly important for countries like Cuba, because these countries are forced to make their economies only suitable for the dollar zone market.
    The widespread support and warm welcome of business and opinion circles around the world for the Moscow International Economic Conference has frightened and panicked the U.S. ruling clique. At present, the U.S. government is doing everything possible to obstruct business circles in capitalist countries from participating in this conference. The U.S. State Department is on the one hand "persuading" American businessmen not to accept invitations to the economic conference; on the other hand, it is releasing information to threaten business circles in Western European countries in an attempt to prevent them from going to Moscow. Ridgway Headquarters in Tokyo also ordered the Yoshida reactionary government to refuse to issue exit visas to Japanese industrialists and businessmen, to deprive them of their right to attend the International Economic Conference. However, this obstruction has been strongly opposed by business circles in various countries. The French "Liberation" newspaper said: "Pressure and threats do not seem to be a major obstacle to the work of the conference. On the one hand, we see that the Western market is tightly closed due to military decisions, and on the other hand, we see a stable and planned market being guaranteed. Therefore, hope has arisen among industrialists, businessmen, and workers in Western countries, even the governments engaged in the Cold War and preparing for war know that this hope is difficult to suppress."
    The convening of the Moscow International Economic Conference has greatly increased people's confidence and hope in developing international economic cooperation and restoring peaceful trade between countries. At present, preparatory committees have been established or delegations to attend the conference have been formed in major countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Economists, business people, trade union and cooperative personnel from various countries, regardless of their political beliefs, will go to Moscow with great hope to work for the development of international economic cooperation and friendship among the people of all countries. This cooperation and friendship will bring peace, prosperity, and happiness to the people of all countries.

    促进和平贸易是世界各国人民的共同愿望
    程光锐
    国际经济会议将于四月三日在莫斯科举行。这个会议是为了促进世界各国间的经济合作关系，以改善各国人民的生活状况、维护世界和平事业而召开的。这个会议的筹备，已引起世界各国工商界和舆论界越来越多的注意和响应。中国、苏联和各人民民主国家的工业、贸易和合作社组织，印度的经济学者，日本的实业界人士，英国和法国的工业家，挪威的渔场主和巴西的商人，以及各国广大人民，都对这个会议寄予很大的希望。
    各国报纸在评述这次会议的意义时，特别强调会议对于促进国际间经济合作和维护世界和平事业的贡献。“匈牙利民族报”指出：这次会议是世界和平运动中最重要的事件。意大利“经济新闻”杂志近几个月来连续刊载了关于国际经济会议的评论和报道。这个杂志强调说，莫斯科会议是在世界和平条件下，走向经济繁荣的道路的一个坚决而重大的步骤。并且“应该把这次会议当作进一步努力改善各国和平经济合作和发展各国经济关系的第一个步骤。”法国资产阶级的“巴黎急进新闻”也承认：国际经济会议可以促成东方和西方贸易的发展，这种贸易的发展，“会使武装的政策让位给和平经济的政策”。
    我国、苏联和各人民民主国家经济的发展，人民生活水平的提高，不仅使这些国家有着丰富的物资可以输出，并且也需要输入别国的商品。因此，只要在平等互利的基础上，我们是乐于与各资本主义国家进行贸易的。国际经济会议我国筹备委员会主任南汉宸说：“中国人民爱好和平，并愿意与各国政府及各国人民在平等互利的基础上，建立与发展通商贸易关系。”苏联商会主席奈斯特洛夫在“新时代”杂志撰文论述苏联和各国间的经济合作问题时写道：苏联已成为一个强大的工业国，运用着科学和技术的最新成就，能够制造各种类型的机器和仪器，这就是扩大和他国的商业合作的坚实基础。苏联又是生产粮食和多种多样原料的大国。苏联拥有丰饶的货物可以输出，同时又是不同种类的制造品和原料的消费者。这一切就为苏联和欧美各资本主义国家之间的贸易的发展创造了良好的条件。今年一月六日的荷兰工商界的“阿尔格明日报”指出：“如果西欧国家想销售它们的货物而获得利润，它们就应该与东欧和中华人民共和国进行贸易。我们必须记住，不仅中国，就是其他亚洲国家也和东欧国家一样，都是很好的顾客，同时也是原料的供给者。”去年十二月八日的美国“指南针日报”说：美国商界之所以热望和苏联开始谈判，不仅因为美国要在今后两年内实行的扩张军备计划不能挽救国内经济颓势，而且更因为他们已经明白苏联伟大的经济成就。
    我国、苏联和各人民民主国家具备着恢复和发展东西贸易的优越条件，而国际经济会议则将给予一个良好的机会，来讨论资本主义国家的工商业家与中国、苏联和各人民民主国家的经济和贸易组织的代表建立联系的可能性。资本主义各国的工商界和舆论界一直在注意这个良好的机会。比利时经济和财政界的“自由之路报”十分重视国际经济会议，这个报纸认为加强东方和西方贸易关系的时候已经到了。甚至美国的“纽约时报”也不得不承认：这次会议是扩大国际贸易的大好机会。
    尽管“美国之音”武断地说东方贸易对于西方毫无意义，然而西方许多工商业家和舆论界依然看到了与东方贸易的重要性，这种重要性是与国际经济会议联系在一起的。英国的“新中欧观察家”周刊强调说：不和东方贸易，西欧就不能生存。前英国贸易大臣萧克劳斯在去年十一月号的“联合国世界”杂志上发表的一篇文章，更有力地驳倒了“美国之音”的无耻谰言。他引证了一九五○年英国与苏联和其他人民民主国家贸易的数字，来说明西方与东方进行贸易是必需的。萧克劳斯写道：
    “我们对东西双方贸易这件事所持的立场和美国的立场是完全不同的，因为这种贸易对于我们是很重要的。”西欧的许多工商业家已经看出，要缓和国内的经济危机，扩大国际间的贸易是最好办法。
    美帝国主义阻止它的仆从国家对我国、苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易的政策，使资本主义各国和美国本身的利益受到了严重的损害，连美国资产阶级政治评论家李普曼也不得不在“纽约先锋论坛报”上承认这一事实。随着国际经济会议开幕日期的日益迫近，资本主义国家工商界和舆论界对美国妨碍国际贸易的政策越来越强烈地表示不满。三月四日的法国“解放报”发表论文说：“对于（西欧）许多厂家，尤其是对于法国厂家，事实已经明白地摆在眼前：与东方贸易在今天就是‘救生圈’，只有与东方贸易才能避免目前已在某些工业——例如纺织业——中发生的工厂倒闭和减产现象。”西德杜塞尔多夫“商业”报撰文，反对美国控制与阻挠西德和人民民主国家及德意志民主共和国的贸易。荷兰“祖国报”对美国强迫荷兰各贸易公司购买价格昂贵、品质低劣的美国煤特别表示愤慨。古巴的经济学家陶拉斯在“今日新闻报”撰文说：国际经济会议对于像古巴这样的国家来说，尤其重要。因为这些国家被迫使它们的经济仅仅适合于美元区的市场。
    世界各国工商界和舆论界对莫斯科国际经济会议的广泛支持和热烈欢迎，已使美国统治集团感到恐惧和惊慌。目前美国政府正竭尽一切力量阻挠资本主义各国工商界参加这个会议。美国国务院一面
    “劝说”美国工商界人士不要接受经济会议的邀请；一面放出空气，威胁西欧各国的工商界人士，企图阻止他们到莫斯科去。东京的李奇微总部并命令吉田反动政府拒发日本工商业家出境签证，来剥夺他们出席国际经济会议的权利。但是，这种阻挠，已遭受到各国工商界的强烈反对。法国“解放报”说：“压力和威胁似乎不会对会议的工作成为很大的障碍。一方面，我们看到西方的市场因为军事上的决定而紧紧关闭着，另一方面我们看到保证稳定的计划性的市场。因此，西方各国的工商界人士和工人当中都对这发生了希望，即使从事冷战和进行战争准备的政府也知道这种希望是很难压得下去的。”
    莫斯科国际经济会议的召开，大大地增加了人们对发展国际经济合作与恢复各国间和平贸易的信心和希望。目前亚洲、欧洲和美洲的各主要国家都成立了筹备委员会或组成了出席会议的代表团。各国的经济学家、工商界人士、工会和合作社的人员，不论他们的政治信仰如何，都将抱着很大的希望到莫斯科去，为发展国际间的经济合作和各国人民间的友谊而努力。这种合作和友谊将给各国人民带来和平、繁荣和幸福。
