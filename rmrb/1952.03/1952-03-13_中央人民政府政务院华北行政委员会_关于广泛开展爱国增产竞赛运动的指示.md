The agricultural production competition movement initiated last year in North China by agricultural labor model Li Shunda has greatly promoted patriotic production increase throughout the region. Many bumper harvest models emerged in the competition, creating new records for high yields. This year, in order to universally improve agricultural production on the basis of last year and to welcome the country's large-scale economic construction, it is necessary to further launch a broad mass patriotic production increase competition movement. This movement is a major driving force for increasing agricultural production, and leading cadres at all levels must pay great attention to it. To this end, it is necessary to:

	I. Continue to thoroughly implement patriotic education and further enhance the enthusiasm of farmers for building the motherland; on the basis of patriotic ideology, universally mobilize villages, groups, and households to formulate patriotic production increase plans. The formulation of plans should go through democratic discussions and have specific targets and methods for increasing production; at the same time, specific measures for drought prevention and resistance should also be formulated. In the process of universally mobilizing the formulation of plans, all localities must grasp the key points, create typical examples, and set up role models, using the formulation of plans to mobilize mass competition and using competition to promote the realization of plans.

	II. Implement the spirit of organizing to boldly develop production, and break the complacent and conservative thinking of "production has reached its peak" and "life is almost good enough," clearing ideological obstacles for the patriotic production increase competition. All localities must widely and deeply publicize the achievements and experiences of bumper harvest models, point out that mutual assistance and cooperation combined with technical guidance are important conditions for increasing production, so as to fully unleash the potential of agricultural production; publicize the policies of rewarding labor production, and introduce the happy and prosperous lives of Soviet farmers, so as to enhance the confidence and enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers in increasing production and launch a large-scale production increase competition movement.

	III. Strengthen organizational leadership and overcome the tendency of spontaneity. At all levels, there should be a group of dedicated personnel responsible for leading this movement, so as to ensure that there is mobilization, inspection, summary, beginning, and end, and implementation throughout the year. During the movement, all localities should carry out mass appraisal activities every quarter, mobilize the masses to supervise each other, summarize quarterly, commend achievements in a timely manner, correct shortcomings, and gradually advance the movement, so as to avoid abortion halfway. After the autumn harvest, all provinces should convene provincial-scale labor model representative conferences and agricultural product exhibitions to carry out commendations and rewards, and make a comprehensive summary.

	IV. Combine bumper harvest competition with cooperative mutual assistance, so that they are interconnected and promote each other. This is the decisive link in organizing bumper harvest competition. Competition within a group and between groups is the basis of the competition movement, and all localities should create model groups and new records for high yields on this basis. The conditions for competition between groups should include the quality of organization; the conditions for competition between regions should include the quantity and quality of organization. All localities should fully demonstrate the superiority of organization through the patriotic production increase competition movement, so that the vast number of farmers can fully realize the benefits of organization in their own experience. Challenges and responses from individual farmers are also good, and all localities should also pay attention to providing leadership. Organizations and individuals participating in the competition with outstanding results should be given material or spiritual rewards by the government in a timely manner, and special emphasis should be placed on commending the production increase achievements of mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives.

	V. Specific methods for organizing the competition:

		1. Participate in the national challenge: (1) Li Shunda's and Geng Changsuo's agricultural production cooperatives participate in the national mutual aid group's joint challenge for comprehensive production increase. Their main conditions are: the yield of all crops and all land in the whole group should be increased by 10% to 15% compared with last year; create high yields of several major crops; and the average yield of the whole group should be higher than that of the local area. (2) Participate in the national competition challenge to increase the unit area yield of several major crops: Rice is participated in by Liu Changwen's mutual aid group, requiring the average yield per mu of the whole group to reach 1,000 jin, and create a new record of 1,500 jin (at least three mu) or more; cotton is participated in by the three mutual aid groups of Qu Yaoli, Zhang Defang and Liang Jiarui, requiring the average yield per mu of the whole group to be 600 jin, and create a new record of 1,000 jin (at least three mu) or more. (3) Competition in state-owned farms: Whether mechanized farms should participate should be studied and decided by each province; non-mechanized farms should be participated in by Yangqu Farm, Yuncheng Farm, Shimen Farm, etc., the condition being that the unit area yield of various crops in the whole farm should be 20% higher than that of local farmers; each farm should propose to create a yield record for one or several major crops (at least ten mu).

		2. Each province should select targets according to conditions and promptly mobilize the mutual aid groups or farms that jointly challenge the whole country to respond to the challenge, and at the same time challenge their own provinces, thereby leading the challenge and response in a chain, all the way to the village.

		3. This year's patriotic production increase competition should first focus on spring plowing, disaster relief, drought prevention, and drought resistance as one of the main contents. The season is very urgent, and it is hoped that all localities will closely combine disaster relief, drought prevention, and spring plowing work, and immediately organize forces to carry out this movement.

    中央人民政府政务院华北行政委员会
    关于广泛开展爱国增产竞赛运动的指示
    华北去年以农业劳动模范李顺达为首发起的农业生产竞赛运动，对全区爱国增产起了极大的推动作用。各地在竞赛中出现了不少的丰产模范，并创造了丰产新纪录。今年为了使农业生产在去年的基础上普遍提高一步，迎接祖国大规模的经济建设，必须进一步开展一个广大的群众性的爱国增产竞赛运动。这一运动，是提高农业生产的重大动力，各级领导干部必须十分重视。为此必须：
    一、继续深入贯彻爱国主义教育，进一步提高农民建设祖国的热情；在爱国主义的思想基础上，普遍发动村、组、户订立爱国增产计划。订计划要经过民主讨论，要有增产的具体目标和办法；同时对防旱抗旱亦应订立具体办法。各地在普遍发动订计划当中，要掌握重点，创造典型，树立榜样，通过订计划发动群众的竞赛，又用竞赛推动计划的实现。
    二、贯彻组织起来放手发展生产的精神，打破“生产到顶”“生活差不多”的自满保守思想，为爱国增产竞赛扫清思想上的障碍。各地必须广泛深入地宣传丰产模范的成绩和经验，指出互助合作结合技术指导是增产的重要条件，以充分发挥农业生产的潜在力量；宣传奖励劳动生产的政策，介绍苏联农民的幸福富裕生活，以提高广大农民的增产信心和热情，展开大规模的增产竞赛运动。
    三、加强组织领导，克服自流偏向。各级应有一批专人分工负责领导这一运动，做到有发动、有检查、有总结，有始有终，贯彻全年。运动中，各地应逐季开展群众性的评比运动，发动群众互相督促，逐季总结，及时表扬成绩，改正缺点，使运动逐步推进，不致中途流产。秋后，各省均应召开全省规模的劳动模范代表会议和农产展览会，进行表扬奖励，作出全面总结。
    四、把丰产竞赛和合作互助结合起来，使它们互相衔接，互相推动。这是组织丰产竞赛的决定环节。一组之内及组与组间的竞赛是竞赛运动的基础，各地应在这一基础上创造模范组和丰产新纪录。组与组间竞赛的条件，应包括组织起来的好坏；地区间竞赛的条件，应包括组织起来的多少、优劣。各地应通过爱国增产竞赛运动，充分显出组织起来的优越性，使广大农民在切身经验中充分体会组织起来的好处。个体农民的挑战应战也是好的，各地也应注意予以领导。参加竞赛的组织和个人，成绩优异的，政府均应及时给以物质或精神奖励，特别应着重表扬互助组和农业生产合作社的增产成绩。
    五、组织竞赛的具体办法：
    1、参加全国挑战：（1）李顺达和耿长锁的农业生产合作社参加全国互助组联名的全面增产挑战。他们的主要条件是：全组所有作物和所有地亩的产量比去年提高百分之十到十五；创造几种主要作物的高产量；全组平均产量应比当地高。（2）参加全国提高几种主要作物单位面积产量的竞赛挑战：水稻由刘长文互助组参加，要求全组每亩平均产量达到一千斤，并创造一千五百斤（至少三亩）以上的新纪录；棉花由曲耀离、张德芳和梁家瑞三个互助组参加，要求全组每亩平均产量六百斤，创造一千斤（至少三亩）以上的新纪录。（3）国营农场的竞赛：机耕农场是否参加请各省研究决定；非机耕农场由阳曲农场、运城农场、石门农场等参加，条件是全农场各种作物的单位面积产量，应比当地农民高百分之二十；每个农场应提出创造一种或几种主要作物（至少十亩）的产量纪录。
    2、各省应根据条件，选择对象，不失时宜地迅即发动向全国联名挑战的互助组或农场应战，同时向本省挑战，由此层层带头，开展连环的挑战应战，一直到村。
    3、今年爱国增产竞赛，首先应以春耕救灾防旱抗旱作为主要内容之一。季节已很紧迫，务望各地密切结合救灾、防旱、春耕工作，立即组织力量开展这一运动。
