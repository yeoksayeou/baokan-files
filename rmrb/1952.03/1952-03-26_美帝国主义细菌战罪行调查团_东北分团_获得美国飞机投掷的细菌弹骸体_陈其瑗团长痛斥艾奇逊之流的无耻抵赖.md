Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 25th: The Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Group on American Imperialist Germ Warfare Crimes" obtained conclusive evidence of American imperialism's germ warfare in Kuandian County, Liaodong Province – a bacterial bomb. Group members Liu Chongle and Ma Shijun, entomology experts, Guo Shutian, an insect research worker, Wang Chun de, a photographer, and Wang Shanlin, a guard, conducted on-the-spot investigations, visited witnesses, and cross-examined evidence from various sources, completely confirming the heinous crime of American imperialism in launching germ warfare against the Chinese people by dropping bacterial bombs.

The first person to discover this evidence of the bacterial bomb was Han Yongbin, the shopkeeper of the Tongjuhe grocery store in Chengnanmenli, Kuandian County. On March 12th, around 12 o'clock noon, eight American planes flew from west to east. He personally saw one of the American planes drop a white object. The white object fell very slowly, and at low altitude, it was clear that it was a long cylindrical shape, with the body of the cylinder sloping northeast. At the time, he estimated that it had landed in Dongmenli. At that time, Li Qiwen, a member of the Northeast Epidemic Prevention Team, happened to be passing by, and Han Yongbin told Li Qiwen about the situation. Afterward, he rushed to the Kuandian Town Office and reported to the town chief, Gao Junshan. The town office and the epidemic prevention team then sent many people to search the area of Chengdongmenli, but they found nothing.

This white object was finally discovered by Li Sijian, a first-year student at Kuandian Middle School, at 1:30 PM on March 21st. Li Sijian discovered an approximately four-inch-deep bomb crater in a cornfield about 150 meters south of the highway in Louhetao, Dongmenwai Village, Chengxiang District of the county (about two li from the county seat). Three meters from the bomb crater was the already bent central axis of the bacterial bomb, with a round iron plate connected to one end of the central axis. About eight meters northwest of the bomb crater was a pile of chicken feathers and some scattered chicken feathers; among them were yellow and white short down feathers and black plumes. The quill tubes were clean and complete, without any flesh or soil, and there were no bones in the feathers. In particular, in an area extending about fifteen meters southwest of the bomb crater, hundreds of pieces of thin, silver-gray plaster shrapnel of varying sizes were scattered on the ground. A large number of venomous insects, such as flies, mosquitoes, spiders, and black springtails, were found nearby. Li Sijian immediately reported to Hu An, the county magistrate of Kuandian County People's Government. Hu An conducted an on-the-spot investigation at 4:00 PM on March 21st. At noon on the 22nd, a subgroup of the Northeast Branch of the Investigation Group, which was conducting an investigation in the Changdian District of the county, returned to the county seat. After hearing the news, they went to the site for an on-the-spot investigation. After interviewing witness Han Yongbin, the investigation subgroup, based on the direction and distance of the "white object" landing as seen by Han on that day, proved that the "white object" dropped by the American aircraft was indeed this exploded bacterial bomb. The central axis of this bacterial bomb was 25 centimeters long and 0.7 centimeters in diameter. The top of the central axis had a hexagonal screw with a perimeter of 1.1 centimeters; the upper perimeter of the screw at the rear end of the central axis was 1 centimeter, and the lower perimeter was 3 centimeters. The diameter of the round iron base plate connected to one end of the central axis was 19 centimeters. To further confirm this, the investigation subgroup went to a certain air defense unit stationed in the county to investigate the situation of enemy aircraft invading the county on March 12th. It was reported that on March 12th, a total of five batches of American aircraft, 28 sorties, invaded, and one batch of eight aircraft flew from Goulouzi in the southwest to the county seat at 12:52 PM, circled for three minutes, and flew to the northeast at 12:57 PM. Based on this situation, it was further proven that this bacterial bomb was dropped by American aircraft.

The Northeast Branch of the Investigation Group has taken photos and films of all the human and material evidence and collected many shrapnel and physical objects.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 25th: Chen Qiyuan, Head of the Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Group on American Imperialist Germ Warfare Crimes" and Director of the Supervisory Committee of the Chinese People's Relief Administration, issued the following statement regarding the discovery of a bacterial bomb dropped by American aircraft two li east of Kuandian City:

Over the past ten days, our investigation group has collected various conclusive evidence, sufficient to fully prove the monstrous crime of American imperialism in spreading various insects and other objects containing germs and viruses on a large scale in the northeastern region of our country. The investigation results regarding the bacterial bomb dropped by American aircraft in Kuandian, released by Xinhua News Agency today, is a powerful example of this conclusive evidence. Seeing this kind of evidence, all people in the world with conscience and a sense of justice will further realize how despicable, filthy, absurd, and shameless it is for those American government and military leaders, such as Acheson and Ridgway, who are directly organizing and directly leading the germ warfare that is destroying human justice and international law, to deny their heinous crimes and even talk about organizing some "International Committee of the Red Cross" to conduct "on-site investigations"!

All members of our investigation group have witnessed various criminal evidence of American imperialism's germ warfare, and we are all infinitely angered by the despicable atrocities of the American murderers. We once again call on all peace-loving people in the world to pay attention: we, the people of the world, must unite and act immediately to stop this barbaric atrocity of American imperialism. Otherwise, all peace-loving people in the world will suffer the disaster of the inhumane germ warfare waged by the American aggressors.

Over the past ten days, all members of our investigation group have also personally witnessed the inspiring situation of the people in the northeastern region heroically launching the battle to defend against germ warfare. Under the leadership of the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, all health science workers and all the people in the northeastern region have formed a strong epidemic prevention line and have achieved brilliant achievements in effectively eliminating the germs and poisonous insects spread by the evil enemy. This once again proves that the industrious, brave, intelligent, and resourceful Chinese people, who have mastered their own destiny under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, are invincible. As long as all the people of our country continue to unite and work hard, the evil plan of American imperialism to carry out germ warfare will surely be completely crushed by us.

    “美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团
    获得美国飞机投掷的细菌弹骸体
    陈其瑗团长痛斥艾奇逊之流的无耻抵赖
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团在辽东省宽甸县获得了美帝国主义进行细菌战的确凿罪证——细菌弹。该分团团员、昆虫学专家刘崇乐、马世骏、昆虫研究工作者郭书田和摄影记者王纯德、警卫员王善林五人进行实地调查，访问和从各方面对证的结果，完全判明了美帝国主义投掷细菌弹向我国人民进行细菌战的滔天罪行。
    最先发现这一细菌弹罪证的人是宽甸县城南门里同聚合杂货铺掌柜韩永斌。在三月十二日十二点多钟，美国飞机八架自西向东飞过，他亲眼看到其中一架美国飞机投下白色物体一个，这白色物体落得很慢，到低空时就清楚地看出是长筒形，筒身向东北方斜垂，当时他估计是落在东门里。那时适有东北防疫队队员李启文走过，韩永斌就把这一情况告诉李启文。此后，他又赶到宽甸镇公所，向镇长高俊山报告。镇公所和防疫队当时就派了很多人到城东门里一带搜查未获。
    这一白色物体终于在三月二十一日午后一时三十分被宽甸中学一年级学生李思俭发现。李思俭在该县城厢区东门外村漏河套（距县城约二里）附近的公路南约一百五十公尺的苞米地里，发现一个约有四寸深的弹坑，距弹坑三公尺的地方有一个业已折弯的细菌弹的中轴，和在中轴一端串连着的一块圆铁板。在弹坑西北约八公尺处有一堆鸡毛和一些分散的鸡毛；其中有黄色白色的短绒毛，有黑色翎毛，翎管干净而完整，没有任何肉质或泥土，而毛中又无骨骼。特别是在距弹坑向西南迤长约十五公尺的一片地带，更发现了数百块大小不等漆着银灰色的石膏质薄碎弹片散落地下。在这附近发现有大量苍蝇、蚊子、蜘蛛、黑跳虫等毒虫。李思俭当即报告宽甸县人民政府县长胡安。胡安在三月二十一日下午四时作了实地勘查。二十二日中午在该县长甸区进行调查工作的调查团东北分团的一个小组返回县城，闻讯后即到现地进行实地勘查。调查小组在访问了目击者韩永斌之后，根据韩当日所见“白色物体”降落方向和距离，证明美机所投“白色物体”正是这一业已爆炸的细菌弹。这一细菌弹的中轴长二十五公分，轴径零点七公分。中轴顶端有六角形螺丝，周径一点一公分；中轴后端螺丝的上周径是一公分，下周径是三公分。中轴之一端所串连的一块圆铁底盘，直径十九公分。调查小组为了更加予以证实，曾至驻该县某防空部队调查三月十二日敌机侵入该县的情况，据称：三月十二日共有美机五批，二十八架次入侵，其中一批八架在十二时五十二分自西南方古楼子飞至县城上空，盘旋三分钟后，在十二时五十七分向东北方向飞去。根据这一情况，更加证明这一细菌弹是美国飞机所投下的。
    调查团东北分团已将所有的人证物证拍摄照片和电影，并搜集了许多弹片和实物。
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团团长、中国人民救济总会监察委员会主任陈其瑗就该团在宽甸城东二华里地方发现美国飞机投下的细菌弹一事，发表谈话如下：
    本调查团过去十天以来已经搜集了各种确凿证据，足以充分证明美帝国主义在我国东北地区大规模地撒布含有病菌和病毒的各种昆虫及其他物体的滔天罪行。今天由新华社发表的关于美国飞机在宽甸投下的细菌弹的调查结果，就是这些确凿证据中的一个有力例证。看了这种证据，全世界一切有良心、有正义感的人们都将会进一步地认识到：正在直接组织、直接领导进行毁灭人类正义和国际公法的细菌战的那些美国政府和军界要人，如像艾奇逊、李奇微之流对于他们的这种万恶罪行的矢口抵赖，还说要组织什么“红十字国际委员会”来进行“实地调查”，是多么下流，多么卑鄙龌龊，多么荒谬和无耻！
    本调查团全体人员目击美帝国主义进行细菌战的各种犯罪证据，对于美国杀人犯的卑鄙暴行，一致感到无限愤怒。我们再一次唤起全世界爱好和平的人类注意：我们全世界人民必须一致行动起来，立即制止美帝国主义的这种野蛮暴行，否则全世界爱好和平的人民就将会遭受到美国侵略者所进行的灭绝人性的细菌战的灾难。
    过去十天以来，本调查团全体人员又亲自看到了东北地区人民英勇地展开防御细菌战斗争的令人鼓舞的情况。东北地区的全体卫生科学工作者和全体人民，在人民政府和中国共产党的领导下，已经组成了坚强的防疫战线，并在有效地消灭万恶敌人所撒布细菌毒虫方面，取得了辉煌的成就。这又一次证明在毛泽东主席和中国共产党的领导下主宰了自己命运的勤劳、英勇、聪明、机智的中国人民，是不可战胜的。只要我们全国人民继续团结努力，美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪恶计划，必将被我们彻底地粉碎。
