    Crush the Bourgeoisie's Frenzied Attack on National Financial Undertakings
    Wang Jingran
    The bourgeoisie's attack on the national financial undertakings began long ago, as the major cities were successively liberated and national banking institutions were gradually established. For more than three years, this attack has become more and more ferocious day by day, and the means have become increasingly sinister.
    Initially, the bourgeoisie's attack was directed at the national bank's takeover of the construction work. Their main prey was the bureaucratic capital and the materials looted by the reactionary rulers that should have been returned to the people. The tactic of the attack was to take advantage of the chaos, muddy the waters, expand and prolong the market chaos, and obstruct the establishment of the people's financial order in many ways. At that time, the bourgeoisie's attack had three main paths: first, colluding with the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, purchasing gold, silver, and foreign currency at low prices to steal property; second, changing appearances to conceal public property, public shares, and the assets of war criminals and traitors; and third, recklessly peddling banknotes, stocks, gold, silver, and foreign currency. Through these activities, many illegal capitalists made a fortune to varying degrees.
    With the gradual development of the national bank's undertakings, the bourgeoisie's attack on the national financial undertakings has become increasingly fierce. Almost all of the financial administrative management and major businesses undertaken by the national bank have been attacked. The activities of illegal capitalists formed a sharp opposition to the financial policies of the people's state. They deliberately expanded the field of gold, silver, foreign currency, or physical valuation activities, and delayed the exercise time of RMB valuation, in order to obstruct the early establishment of the RMB standard system. They recklessly issued blank checks or took advantage of the difference in the value of several currencies that could not be unified for a time, creating opportunities for speculative activities and undermining the People's Government's efforts to clarify the financial market. In terms of foreign trade, illegal importers used various excuses to fraudulently obtain foreign exchange or smuggle gold and silver out of the country, and then pretended to import with self-provided foreign exchange, moving in things that the state and the broad masses of people did not need at all during the economic recovery period. Illegal exporters falsely reported or underreported the amount of foreign exchange settlement or repeatedly delayed the foreign exchange settlement period, handing over large quantities of useful materials from the country. Illegal operators of bank firms competed with national banks for business positions with huge interest rates several times higher than those of national banks; they engaged in out-of-business operations with funds several times larger than loans, trying every means to evade state management; they set up layers of back accounts to carry out various illegal activities. More dangerously, they disregarded the interests of depositors and implemented excessive credit expansion, lending large amounts of useful funds to speculative merchants.
    After the unified management of financial and economic work in April 1950, the national financial undertakings of the new China, after continuous struggles, grew stronger and stronger, and the bourgeoisie's attack failed shamefully. But they were not reconciled, and they quickly launched a new offensive. Moreover, the target of the attack was more extensive, and the means used were more despicable and vicious. Their tactic was to "penetrate the heart and abdomen," and the main prey was intelligence and funds. They adopted the methods of "sending in" and "pulling over" to carry out the following four aspects of activities: (1) Through the private business of the national bank, find the weaknesses and loopholes in the business departments of the national bank. (2) Import and export merchants combined with foreign trade to find the weaknesses and loopholes in the national bank's foreign exchange management and operation. (3) Private financial operators found the weaknesses and loopholes in the financial administrative management of the national bank through financial administrative management work. (4) More generally, through the purchasing departments and personnel of state-owned financial institutions, they targeted the printing and general affairs departments, whose main task was procurement and construction work, as a path to "kill in and kill out." There are as many as dozens of specific methods of the bourgeoisie's attack on the national financial undertakings, which are difficult to enumerate. Among them, there are about four types that are specific to the banking sector and are the most important:
    (1) Opening "underground banks" within the national bank. This is one of the most vicious methods. So far, "underground banks" have been found in the internal structures of national banks in major cities such as Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan. The operators wear the guise of national bank staff, run errands, attract deposits, and privately engage in interbank lending. They collect on one hand and lend on the other, earn interest for themselves, and transfer the principal to the businesses operated by the bourgeoisie, turning it into a force for profiteering. The interest rates for interbank lending by these "underground banks" are not only far higher than those of national banks, but also higher than those of private banks. These people are essentially new usurers.
    (2) Placing financial "moles" to steal confidential information. According to the materials discovered in various places, the bourgeoisie has already sent a considerable number of financial "moles" into the national bank institutions. Some of them mixed in after the liberation through exams; some were pulled in by relatives and friends; some were already lurking before the liberation. Some of them hold capital shares or "hero shares" in the bourgeoisie's speculative enterprises, some have established a pricing relationship for the buying and selling of intelligence; some openly or secretly directly serve as directors or managers of certain private enterprises. The scope of their theft of intelligence is quite extensive, the most important being the changes in market prices, gold and silver exchange rates, the rise and fall of interest rates, the increase or suspension of various businesses, and major measures that have been decided and have not yet been decided.
    (3) Colluding from the inside and outside to fraudulently obtain loans. This is a more general offensive activity. Many illegal capitalists falsely reported funds before the loan, and did not use the loan for the originally reported purpose after the loan. For example, Tianjin merchant Wu Yusheng sent his son Wu Shucheng into the national bank, and colluded from the inside and outside, fabricating credit investigation reports, falsely reporting funds, and fraudulently obtaining loans of more than 800 million yuan in less than a year. As for those who do not use the loan for the intended purpose and engage in speculation and profiteering, there are too many to mention. In fraudulently obtaining loans, many merchants also colluded with embezzlers to modify the documents for applying for loans in the office to make them meet the purpose; or they simply did not implement the regulations, and lent huge amounts of money without collateral or with less collateral; others were nominally rolling over, but actually occupying it all year round.
    (4) Partnering in business, using public funds to support private interests. This is an offensive that is almost open robbery. Illegal capitalists collude with embezzlers within the national bank to steal large amounts of state funds to carry out illegal commercial speculation activities. The merchants stumble around outside to "do business," and the embezzlers provide funds internally, eating "hero shares" or taking dividends. The methods they use to steal and defraud funds are: 1. Illegally withdrawing deposits from state organs and state-owned economic units for the use of merchants. 2. Through financial insiders in charge of cashiers, unauthorized use of treasury funds, using IOUs to fill the inventory. 3. Repeatedly using prize savings deposits, using the next period's deposit to offset the previous period's submission. 4. Secretly opening drafts, falsely claiming remittances or delaying payments. 5. Altering accounting procedures, falsifying accounts or changing the type and term of depositors' deposits. As a result of partnering in "business," illegal capitalists have obtained several times, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times the exorbitant profits, and the losses suffered by the national bank are difficult to calculate.
    In order for the national bank to play its due role in national construction, it is necessary to first carry out a deep-seated anti-corruption struggle within the interior, purify the internal organization, and cut off the claws of illegal capitalists. The first priority is the confidential information management department, which is the key area for illegal capitalists to steal intelligence; the second priority is the business department, which is the key area for fraudulently obtaining funds; and the third priority is the printing and general affairs departments. For the personnel working in these departments, except for those with a clear history, it is necessary to conduct a review to find out whether they have direct, indirect, fixed or unfixed economic ties with the bourgeoisie. The past facts must be thoroughly clarified, and it must also be guaranteed that the claws of illegal capitalists will not be inserted in the future, so that financial insiders have nowhere to hide.
    Second, the staff of the national bank system, in addition to actively carrying out the anti-corruption struggle, should also actively participate in the anti-theft struggle of the business community, closely cooperate with the overall movement, and liquidate the various illegal activities of illegal capitalists. In this battle, we can also obtain more comprehensive information needed by the system, which is a very important link for the entire combat mission we are responsible for.
    Third, it is necessary to carry out extensive and in-depth ideological education in the national bank system. The vast majority of members of the national bank system, in addition to a small number of old cadres and students newly recruited after liberation, were taken over from the pseudo-national bank system of the four major families of the reactionary rulers. Most of them have never undergone systematic ideological transformation. A small number of people have lived in training classes, but for a very short time. Therefore, a serious task currently before us is to carry out universal ideological transformation work. After the study of cadres and this anti-corruption movement, favorable conditions have been created for carrying out this work. We should seize the opportunity and actively prepare to carry it out. The focus of the transformation should be on liquidating bourgeois ideology, and establishing the leadership ideology of the working class in a planned and step-by-step manner. If this work can be carried out well, coupled with the victory of the anti-theft movement in the business community, even if illegal capitalists have thousands of brilliant plans, it will be difficult for them to carry out their conspiracies in the national bank system.

    粉碎资产阶级对国家金融事业的猖狂进攻
    王静然
    资产阶级对国家金融事业的进攻，远在各大城市次第解放、国家银行机构逐步建立的时候便已开始。三年多以来，这种进攻一天凶似一天，手段也日益毒辣。
    最初，资产阶级的进攻指向国家银行的接管建行工作。他们的主要猎取物，是应该归还人民的官僚资本和反动统治者掠夺走的物资。进攻的战术是乘火打劫，混水摸鱼，扩大和拖长市场混乱局势，多方阻挠人民金融秩序的建立。那时，资产阶级进攻的路子主要有三条：一是勾结官僚资产阶级，低价套购金银外币，窃取财物。二是改头换面，隐匿公产公股及战犯卖国贼的逆产。三是肆无忌惮地捣贩钞票、股票、金银外币。经过这些活动，许多违法资本家程度不一地都发了一批横财。
    随着国家银行事业的逐步发展，资产阶级对国家金融事业的进攻也日趋猛烈。国家银行担负的金融行政管理及重大业务，几乎无一不遭受袭击。违法资本家的活动，与人民国家的金融政策形成尖锐的对立。他们故意扩大金银、外币或实物计价的活动领域，拖延人民币计价的行使时间，以阻挠人民币本位制度的及早建立。他们放肆地乱开空头支票，或套取一时尚未能统一的几种货币币值的差额，制造投机活动机会，破坏人民政府对澄清金融市场的努力。在对外贸易方面，违法进口商假借各种藉口，骗取外汇，或盗运金银出境，再伪装自备外汇进口，搬进国家与广大人民在经济恢复时期完全不需要的东西。违法出口商则虚报、少报结汇额度，或一再拖延结汇期限，将国家有用的大批物资拱手送人。违法的行庄经营者，以数倍于国家银行的巨额利息，与国家银行争夺营业阵地；以数倍于放款的资金，从事业外经营，千方百计地逃避国家的管理；设立一层层的后账，进行各种非法的勾当。更危险的是，不顾存户利益，实行过度的信用膨胀，把有用的资金大批贷给投机奸商。
    一九五○年四月财经工作统一管理以后，新中国的国家金融事业经过连续斗争，日益发展壮大起来，资产阶级的进攻可耻地失败了。但他们并不甘心，他们很快就发动了新的攻势。而且，进攻的目标更为广泛，使用的手段更加卑鄙而恶毒。他们的战术是“穿心入腹”，进攻的主要猎取物是情报和资金。他们采取“派进来”和“拉过去”的办法，进行以下四方面的活动：（一）通过国家银行的私人业务，找国家银行营业部门的弱点和空子。（二）进出口商结合对外贸易，找国家银行外汇管理和经营方面的弱点与空子。（三）私营金融业者通过金融行政管理工作，找国家银行金融行政管理方面的弱点和空子。（四）较带普遍性的，是透过国营金融机关采买部门和人员，对准以采购修建工作为主要任务的印刷、总务部门，作为“杀出杀进”的路径。资产阶级对国家金融事业进攻的具体方法，多达数十种，难以枚举。其中具有银行部门特殊性的和最为主要的，大约有以下四种类型：
    （一）在国家银行之内开设“地下钱庄”。这是一种最为毒辣的办法。到目前为止，天津、北京、上海、武汉等主要城市都已先后发现国家银行内部有“地下钱庄”。其经营者披着国家银行工作人员的外衣，跑外勤，拉存款，私自经营拆放。一手收进，一手放出，利息自得，本金转到资产阶级经营的事业上，变成了牟取暴利的力量。这些“地下钱庄”拆放的利率不仅远高于国家银行，而且高于私营行庄。这些人实质上是新的高利贷主。
    （二）安置金融“坐探”，盗窃机密情报。根据各地已发现的材料，资产阶级已经派有相当数量的金融“坐探”打进国家银行机构。其中有些是在解放后经过考试混进来的；有些是被亲戚朋友拉进来的；有些是在解放以前就已埋伏下的。他们有的在资产阶级的投机企业中占有资金股或“好汉股”，有的建立了情报买卖的计价关系；有的公开或秘密地直接兼任着某种私营企业的董事或经理。他们盗窃情报的范围颇为广泛，最主要的是行情物价、金银外汇牌价的变动，利息的升降，各种业务的增办、缓办以及已决定和未决定的重大措施。
    （三）里应外合，骗取贷款。这是一种较带普遍性的进攻活动。许多违法资本家在贷款之前即虚报资金，贷款之后也不按原报用途使用贷款。如天津奸商吴禹生把他儿子吴树柽派进国家银行后，里应外合，捏造徵信调查表，虚报资金，不到一年就连续骗取贷款八亿多元。至于贷款后不按用途使用而进行投机倒把的，更举不胜举。在骗取贷款上，还有许多奸商勾结贪污分子，在办公室为他们修改申请贷款的文件，使之符合用途；或根本不执行规定，无押品或少交押品即贷得巨款；也有的是名为转期，实系常年占用。
    （四）合伙营商，以公养私。这是一种近乎公开抢劫的进攻。违法资本家与国家银行内的贪污分子勾结，大量盗窃国家资金，进行非法的商业投机活动。奸商们在外东撞西骗“作生意”，贪污分子在内供给资金，吃“好汉股”或分取红利。他们盗骗资金的方法有：一、非法动支国家机关、国营经济单位的存款，供奸商周转之用。二、通过掌管出纳的金融内奸分子，擅自动用库款，以白条充库存。三、轮番套用有奖储蓄存款，用下期存款抵上期上解。四、偷开汇票，冒领汇款或拖延付汇。五、涂改会计手续凭证，假造账目或改换存户的存款种类、期限。合伙谋“商”的结果，违法资本家获得数倍、数十倍，乃至数百倍的暴利，国家银行所受的损失，难以数计。
    为了使国家银行在国家建设中发挥应有的作用，必须首先在内部深入开展反贪污斗争，纯洁内部组织，斩断违法资本家的魔爪。首先是机密资料管理部门，这是违法资本家窃取情报的要害地方；其次是营业部门，这是骗取资金的要害地方；第三是印刷、总务部门。对于在这些部门工作的人员，除历史确实清楚者外，必须进行审查，弄清他们是不是和资产阶级有直接的、间接的、固定的或不固定的经济联系。已往的事实要彻底弄清，还要保证今后不使违法资本家的魔爪插入，使金融内奸分子无处藏身。
    第二、国家银行系统工作人员，除积极进行反贪污斗争外，还应该同时积极参加工商界的反盗窃斗争，密切配合全面运动，清算违法资本家各种违法活动。在这个战斗中，也可以更全面地取得本系统所需要的资料，对自己担负的整个战斗任务说，这是非常重要的环节。
    第三、要在国家银行系统中进行广泛深入的思想教育。国家银行系统的大批成员，除了少部分老干部和解放后新招收的学生外，绝大部分都是从反动统治者四大家族的伪国家银行系统中接收过来的。其中大多数未曾进行过有系统的思想改造。少部分人虽曾住过轮训班之类，但为时极短。因此摆在目前的一个严重任务，就是要进行普遍的思想改造工作。经过审查干部的学习和这次反贪污运动，进行这一工作已具备了有利的条件。应抓紧时机，积极准备进行。改造的重点，应以清算资产阶级思想为主，有计划、有步骤地树立工人阶级的领导权思想。这一工作如能进行得好，再加上工商界反盗窃运动的胜利，违法资本家纵有千条妙计，也将难能在国家银行系统中施展他们的阴谋。
