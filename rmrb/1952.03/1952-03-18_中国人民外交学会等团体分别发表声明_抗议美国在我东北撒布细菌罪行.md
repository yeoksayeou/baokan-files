Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and the Preparatory Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Chinese Christian Church have issued statements respectively, supporting Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement of March 8 and protesting the heinous crimes of the U.S. aggressors in brazenly conducting bacteriological warfare in Northeast China.

The statement of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs said: The extremely vicious U.S. imperialists, following their inhumane bacteriological warfare in Korea, have recently become even more frenzied and dared to invade our Northeast airspace, spreading bacteria, wantonly bombing and strafing, and massacring our peaceful people. This direct and open violation of our airspace is a naked act of aggression. At the same time, the U.S. aggressors' use of bacteriological weapons to carry out large-scale massacres of peaceful people constitutes the most serious "crime against humanity" under international law. We can never tolerate such outrageous crimes by U.S. imperialism. We fully support the solemn statement issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our Central People's Government regarding this incident.

The statement of the Preparatory Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Chinese Christian Church said: U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's shameless statement on March 4 not only cannot conceal the ugly crimes of the U.S. aggressors, but also exposes the hypocritical true face of U.S. imperialism. U.S. war criminals will inevitably be judged justly by the peace-loving people of the world, just like the fascist butchers of Japan, Germany, and Italy. We want to call on peace-loving and righteous Christians and Christian organizations to immediately rise up with a spirit of never compromising with evil, and for the sake of world peace, for the sake of humanity, and for the sake of justice, to jointly condemn and resolutely stop the U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes of using bacteriological weapons to massacre the people of China and Korea.

[Report from this newspaper] The All-China Students' Federation, the Chinese Society of Plant Pathology, the Beijing Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology, and others, unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement and protest the U.S. aggressors' crimes of spreading bacteria in Northeast China. The All-China Students' Federation issued a statement on March 11, saying: We, on behalf of students across the country, express our utmost anger and lodge a serious protest with the U.S. government. We must transform our anger into strength, continue to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, thoroughly complete the tasks of the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and further vigorously increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and give the frenzied U.S. aggressors an even heavier blow.

The Chinese Society of Plant Pathology issued a declaration on March 11, saying: We, all plant pathology workers, firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement of March 8 and the protests of various democratic parties on March 8, and are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and actively participate in the work against bacteriological warfare.

The Beijing Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology issued a statement saying: We are confident that we can wipe out all the conspiracies of the U.S. aggressors on the anti-bacteriological warfare front. The enemy's madness and brutality can only accelerate its own demise.

    中国人民外交学会等团体分别发表声明
    抗议美国在我东北撒布细菌罪行
    【新华社十四日讯】中国人民外交学会、中国基督教抗美援朝三自革新运动委员会筹备委员会分别发表声明，拥护周恩来外长三月八日的声明，并抗议美国侵略者公然在我国东北疯狂进行细菌战的万恶罪行。
    中国人民外交学会的声明说：穷凶极恶的美帝国主义者，继其在朝鲜进行灭绝人性的细菌战争之后，最近竟更加疯狂地敢于侵入我东北领空，撒布细菌，滥施轰炸扫射，屠杀我国和平人民。这种直接公开对我领空的侵犯，是赤裸裸的侵略行为。同时，美国侵略者使用细菌武器对和平人民进行大规模的屠杀，是犯了国际法上最严重的“违反人道罪”。对于美国帝国主义这种疯狂绝顶的罪行，我们是决不能容忍的。我们完全拥护我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长对于这一事件所发表的严正声明。
    中国基督教抗美援朝三自革新运动委员会筹备委员会的声明说：三月四日美国国务卿艾奇逊的无耻声明，不但遮不住美国侵略者的丑恶罪行，反而暴露了美帝国主义假冒为善的真面目。美国战争罪犯们必然会像日、德、意法西斯屠夫们一样受到全世界和平人民的正义裁判。我们要呼吁爱好和平正义的基督教徒和基督教组织，立即起来以决不与罪恶妥协的精神，为了世界和平，为了人道，为了正义，一致声讨并坚决制止美帝国主义使用细菌武器、屠杀中朝人民的滔天罪行。
    【本报讯】中华全国学生联合会、中国植物病理学会、北京市科学技术普及协会等，一致拥护周恩来外长的严正声明，抗议美国侵略者在我东北境内撒布细菌的罪行。中华全国学生联合会三月十一日发表声明说：我们代表全国同学以无比的愤怒向美国政府提出严重抗议。我们要化愤怒为力量，继续加强抗美援朝运动，彻底完成反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的任务，并进一步厉行增产节约，以支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，给疯狂的美国侵略者以更沉重的打击。
    中国植物病理学会三月十一日发表宣言说：我们全体植物病理学工作者坚决拥护周外长三月八日的声明和各民主党派三月八日的抗议，并准备随时响应祖国的号召，积极参加反细菌战的工作。
    北京市科学技术普及协会发表声明说：我们有信心在反细菌战的战线上扑灭美国侵略者的一切阴谋。敌人的疯狂与残暴只能加速它自己的死亡。
