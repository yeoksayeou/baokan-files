    Opposing Idealism and Mechanism in Chemistry
    --On the Discussion of the Chemical Structure Theory in Organic Chemistry by Soviet Scientists and Its Significance

    Following the resolution on ideological issues issued by the Central Committee of the CPSU, in recent years, the Soviet scientific community has waged an uncompromising struggle against various idealistic, agnostic, and mechanical ideas in science, as well as various reactionary bourgeois ideas that corrode science. They have vigorously advanced the development of science on the basis of dialectical materialism—the Marxist-Leninist worldview. The conference on Michurin biology, the conference on Pavlov's doctrine, the conference on the evolution of celestial bodies in the solar system, the discussion on criticizing Bohr, Heisenberg, and other idealist concepts in physics, etc., are all evidence of the vigorous development of Soviet science.

    The attention of the Soviet chemical community is focused on the discussion of the chemical structure theory in organic chemistry and the criticism of the bourgeois idealistic and mechanical "resonance theory" and "intermediate theory." This discussion, which began at the end of 1949, became a nationwide discussion in the Soviet Union. More than 20 discussion articles were published in various magazines, and discussion meetings were held in several scientific institutions. Finally, in June 1951, the Chemical Bureau of the Soviet Academy of Sciences convened an All-Soviet discussion meeting with more than 400 scholars, summarizing this discussion.

    The importance attached to the chemical structure theory problem is determined by the great importance of the problem itself and the current state of the theory. On the one hand, the chemical structure theory should be a basic theory with a high degree of generalization and principles, summarizing a large number of chemical facts and laws. On the other hand, it should be the foundation of chemical industry development and the guide for chemical synthesis practice. Precisely because we have mastered certain knowledge about chemical structure, we are able to establish a strong chemical industry today, especially the organic chemical industry, such as synthetic rubber, synthetic gasoline industry, rayon, dyes, plastic industry, and synthesize extremely useful chemical preparations such as antibiotics, insecticides, photosensitizers, and flotation agents. Without the chemical structure theory, these chemical industries are unimaginable. It can be seen from this how important the practical significance is to carry out the struggle of upholding the materialist, dialectical, theory-practice linked route, and opposing idealistic, mechanical tendencies that separate theory from practice in the chemical structure theory.

    (I)

    The foundation of the chemical structure theory was laid by the great Russian chemist Alexander Butlerov around 1861. Butlerov's materialist chemical structure theory arose with the progressive trend of Russian revolutionary democracy at that time and was an integral part of it. At the same time, his chemical structure theory was based on the large amount of chemical facts accumulated at that time and was produced in the struggle against the agnostic ideas of chemists such as Gerhardt.

    What were the basic ideas of Butlerov's chemical structure theory?

    He believed that in the formation of an object, each chemical molecule in the object acts with its own certain chemical force. The distribution of this chemical force is called the chemical structure of the substance. As a result of this distribution, chemical atoms directly or indirectly affect and combine with each other to form chemical particles.

    He pointed out more than once that the components of chemical molecules are connected in a certain way and influence each other at the same time. Not only should we pay attention to the direct connection and influence of atoms and bonds in the molecule, but also another kind of mutual connection and influence, which he called "mutual influence between atoms that are not directly connected."

    His entire work is permeated with the idea that the chemical properties of a substance are determined by the chemical structure of its molecules. Through the study of chemical properties, we can understand the structure of molecules. Conversely, according to the chemical structure of molecules, we can predict the chemical properties of substances and judge the chemical properties of substances.

    He believed that each chemical molecule has only one certain structure. It is impossible for several different structures to coexist in one molecule. Through the study of chemical properties, we understand the certain structure unique to each molecule. Therefore, we should correctly use a certain structural formula to reflect this molecule.

    He opposed the mechanist view of some chemists at the time who regarded chemical molecules as simple aggregates of a pile of atoms. He regarded chemical molecules as a group of atoms connected in a certain way, which are interconnected and influence each other, bringing new elements in terms of properties, making the overall molecule qualitatively different from a simple accumulation of individual atoms. He opposed the view that chemical structure is unrecognizable, believing that the true structure of molecules and the mutual influence of atoms in molecules are completely recognizable, and can be reflected by structural formulas. The structural formula should be the image, reflection, and imitation of the true structure of the substance, not something arbitrarily fabricated. This is the essence of the materialist thought and dialectical elements in Butlerov's theory.

    This theory, which correctly reflects the objective reality of chemical molecules, can naturally withstand the rigorous test of practice. It not only explained the chemical facts discovered at that time, but also predicted many chemical substances that had not yet been discovered, predicted some isomers of chemical substances, and pointed out the direction for the synthesis of new substances. It opened the way for the development of the organic chemical industry.

    Under the guidance of Butlerov's materialist thought, the chemical structure theory itself has also been continuously developing. Research on the mutual influence of atoms in molecules and many chemical reactions, the theory of spatial structure of organic substances, the theory of optical isomerism, and the theory of mutarotation have all advanced the chemical structure theory. Especially with the progress of physics and the emergence of electronic theory and quantum theory, many concepts previously summarized by chemists from chemical facts have been explained, such as the nature of chemical bonds, the fact of bond saturation, the geometric shape of molecules, etc., and some new concepts have been proposed. With the help of new physical research methods, people are able to more clearly penetrate the course of chemical reactions, the transmission mode of atomic interactions, etc., making people's knowledge in this area greatly expanded.

    The Butlerov chemical structure theory has developed to today, and it is much richer, more detailed, and more profound than it was ninety years ago. Therefore, on the surface, Butlerov's theory in the nineteenth century is "old" and "not specific". However, the materialist thought of Butlerov's theory is always new and concrete. It demonstrates its power when fighting against the idealistic thought of "resonance theory" popular in chemistry today. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the rich achievements obtained today in the research of chemical structure theory are based on Butlerov's materialist theory. We must cherish this heritage and strive to continue to develop it on the basis of Butlerov's materialist theory, making it more profound, more detailed, and richer.

    (II)

    However, in the past two decades, a tendency represented by "resonance theory" and "intermediate theory" has been popular in the chemical structure theory of organic chemistry. This tendency is incompatible with the Butlerov direction, and it is idealistic, mechanical, and completely useless in practice; it hinders the development of science.

    "Resonance theory", as well as "intermediate theory" which converges and dissolves into "resonance theory", prides itself on being a theory produced by the application of the latest achievements in physics—quantum mechanics—in chemistry. Using such a banner, it deceived many credulous chemists, and thus gained considerable circulation. But in essence, "resonance theory" is not at all a result of quantum mechanics, but a speculation on quantum mechanics and chemistry. "Resonance theory" takes advantage of the characteristic of the flat combination of functions (that is, one function is equal to the sum of many other functions) in a certain approximate method of calculating molecules by quantum mechanics, and groundlessly insists that each function as an added term represents a "structure" of the molecule, and believes that many such "structures" objectively exist in the molecule (for example, it is said that benzene has five, naphthalene has forty-two, and anthracene has four hundred and twenty-nine), and these "structures" can be arbitrarily drawn as long as they are based on the valence rules, and the molecule "resonates" between these "structures", and these resonating "structures" and the "resonance" between them determine all the properties of the molecule.

    The "structures" fictionalized by the "resonance theory" in fact only exist in the minds of the founders of the "resonance theory", and there is no experimental proof of their objective existence. However, the "resonance theory" insists that they objectively exist and are actually "resonating", determining the objective properties of molecules. Subjective fiction replaces objective reality. This is the idealistic essence of the "resonance theory."

    The creators of the "resonance theory" also seem to feel their arbitrariness, so they try to cover it up, saying: "The convenience and value of the resonance concept in the study of chemical problems is so great that the shortcomings of its arbitrary factors do not matter." This is really a clumsy attempt to conceal something! Isn't this the same as the principle of "thought economy" of Machists, which was shattered by Lenin long ago? According to the principle of "thought economy", the criterion for measuring a theory seems to be not whether it conforms to reality, but whether it is convenient and economical.

    The error of the "resonance theory" is not only limited to idealism, it also has a mechanical tendency. It attempts to reduce chemistry to quantum mechanics.

    Chemistry is the science that studies the chemical form of the movement of matter, while quantum mechanics is the science that studies the mechanics of atoms, electrons, etc. The movement in chemical form is a high-level form of movement, and the mechanical movement of electrons, etc., is a low-level form of movement. When analyzing the relationship between high-level and low-level forms of movement, Engels said: "This does not mean that every high-level form of movement does not always have to be connected with the actual mechanical movement (external or molecular), just as the high-level form of movement also produces other forms of movement; chemical action is impossible without temperature and electrical changes, and organic life is impossible without mechanical, molecular, chemical, thermal, electrical, and other changes. However, the existence of these secondary forms cannot completely include the essence of each main form. One day we can indeed use experimental methods to 'reduce' thinking to molecular and chemical movements in the brain, but does this completely include the essence of thinking?"

    Precisely because chemical action is inevitably accompanied by the mechanical movement of atoms, electrons, etc., and precisely because the atoms and electrons in chemical molecules equally obey the laws of quantum mechanics, we do not reject the use of quantum mechanics in chemistry. In fact, quantum mechanics can indeed solve problems such as calculating molecular energy, the spatial position of atoms, and the distribution of electron clouds. In these problems, the quantum mechanics calculation results are consistent with the experimental results, which is a powerful proof.

    However, on the other hand, chemical molecules are not simply a collection of atoms and electrons. It has new properties that a simple collection of atoms and electrons cannot have. Therefore, quantum mechanics can never "completely include" chemistry, and chemistry cannot be reduced to quantum mechanics. For example, the problems of molecular reactivity, the course and dynamics of chemical reactions, etc., cannot be solved only by quantum mechanics, even if they involve simple molecules. If we must only use quantum mechanics for calculation, the result will of course be contrary to the experiment. However, the "resonance theory" attempts to reduce chemistry to quantum mechanics, exaggerates the role of quantum mechanics, and claims to be omnipotent, thinking that it can completely replace the chemical structure theory. Supporters of the "resonance theory" even publicly declared that "quantum mechanics reduces chemical problems to applied mathematics problems." This is the mechanical essence of the "resonance theory."

    Such an idealistic and mechanical theory, of course, will not be of any use in practice. It plays with many fictitious "structures," creating the illusion that it explains many chemical facts and laws, but in reality it does not solve any problems. Whenever a new experimental result is published and cannot be explained by the existing "structure" of the chemical molecule, they immediately concoct several new "structures" based on subjective imagination to match it, saying that the chemical molecule "resonates" between the old "structure" and the newly fictionalized "structure", so as to explain the experimental results. The "resonance theory" thus always follows behind the experiment, limiting its task to far-fetched "explanations" of phenomena. For twenty years, the "resonance theory" has never predicted any new organic matter, nor has it predicted any molecular characteristics, that is to say, it has never proved its correctness in practice. Chairman Mao said in "On Practice": "Marxists consider that only social practice can be the criterion of truth for people's knowledge of the outside world. The actual situation is that only when people achieve the results they expect in social practice (in the process of material production, in the process of class struggle, in the process of scientific experiment) is people's knowledge confirmed. If people want to obtain the victory of work, that is, to obtain the expected result, they must make their thoughts conform to the laws of the objective outside world. If they do not conform, they will fail in practice. ... Whether a cognition or theory is truth is not determined by how it feels subjectively, but by the results of objective social practice. The criterion of truth can only be social practice." In practice, the "resonance theory" is completely bankrupt. It is only a theory that its creators think is very "convenient", but it does not conform to the objective outside world and the laws of objective chemical molecular movement.

    The "resonance theory" makes many chemists spend their energy playing with fictitious "structures," deviating from reality, abandoning practical research work, abandoning the important practical tasks put forward by production development and scientific development, and harming the interests of the people. The actual harmfulness of the "resonance theory" lies here.

    It should be pointed out that the resonance theory tendency in chemistry is not an isolated phenomenon. It is closely related to the reactionary tendencies in other scientific departments. Idealism, Machism, and detachment from reality are precisely the common characteristics of reactionary tendencies in various sciences. The idealism of "physics," which was shattered by Lenin long ago, is still widely spread in physics and serves as the ancestor and friend of the "resonance theory." And mechanism is also the methodological characteristic of various reactionary thoughts. Reducing social life to biology, reducing biology to chemistry, and reducing chemistry to mechanics and mathematics, in this set of reduction "chains", the "resonance theory" is an important link.

    The "resonance theory" and other idealistic theories in various sciences jointly form a reactionary front to oppose materialism. The struggle between idealism and materialism in science, in the final analysis, reflects the struggle between two classes (the bourgeoisie and the proletariat), two social systems, and two camps. This is the class basis and social background of this struggle.

    (III)

    So, abandoning the anti-scientific "resonance theory", what is the direction of future development of the chemical structure theory?

    The decision of the Soviet scientific community's discussion meeting on the chemical structure theory problem is written very clearly:

    "The discussion meeting believes that it is necessary to fully develop the work of the theoretical department of organic chemistry. The main direction of organic chemistry is the direction of synthesis, and the accompanying use of synthetic organic chemistry methods to study the properties and structure of organic matter—including natural organic matter. The connection between theory and practice is most clearly demonstrated in chemical synthesis. Moreover, in the work of synthesis, the structure theory is constantly confirmed and deepened, and the scope of application of the structure theory is expanded. In the direction of synthesis, the structure theory can find new impetus for development.

    "The discussion meeting pointed out that the most important task of theoretical organic chemistry is to creatively develop the Butlerov theory, deepen and expand the basic principles of the Butlerov theory according to modern concepts of the structure of matter. The development of theoretical organic chemistry, especially the development of chemical structure theory, must be carried out on the basis of the dialectical materialist worldview and in a firm struggle against idealistic and mechanical theories in chemistry.

    "The attention of Soviet scholars must be focused on deepening and expanding the understanding of the chemical structure of matter, and on developing the theory of mutual influence of atoms in molecules. It is necessary to study the relationship between molecular reactivity and structure and medium. Studying the process of elements and the process and dynamics of reactions—including catalytic reactions—is of great significance. Studying the relationship between the chemical, physical, physiological, and other properties of organic matter and its structure is also the most important task. In order to complete the task of chemical structure theory, in addition to using chemical research methods and roads that have gloriously proved their effectiveness, we must pay more attention to all the achievements in related scientific departments, especially all the wealth of modern physics and its experimental and theoretical methods. ...

    "The discussion meeting believes that physical research methods have not been used as they should be in organic chemistry. The discussion meeting believes that it is necessary to widely use spectroscopic analysis, electron diffraction, mass spectrometry, and other methods to study the structure and properties of organic compounds. The task of developing the chemical structure theory requires exploring various new physical and physical chemistry research methods adapted to the characteristics of these tasks. The discussion meeting calls on physicists and physical chemists to actively participate in seeking these methods. ...

    "Soviet theoretical physicists and mathematicians must actively participate in the study of theoretical chemical problems and quantum mechanics calculation methods. Only through the cooperation of chemists and physicists can the chemical structure theory become the quantitative theory that Butlerov called for establishing. ..."

    Obviously, using all theoretical and experimental research methods, using all modern physical and chemical methods, cooperating with scientists from various departments, closely linking with reality, developing the Butlerov theory on the basis of dialectical materialism, and struggling against all idealistic tendencies, this is the direction of forward development of chemical structure theory.

    Going in this direction requires a lot of practical work, which is much more difficult than playing with fictitious "structures" of the "resonance theory". This is a difficult but glorious task, a task that the people demand that scientists bear and solve. Progressive scientists will bravely take on this task and advance victoriously under the illumination of the brilliant ideas of Marxism-Leninism.

    (IV)

    What is the significance of this discussion on the chemical structure theory problem by the Soviet scientific community for our Chinese scientific community?

    First, the most direct significance is to help Chinese scientists get rid of the idealistic influence of the "resonance theory."

    It should be said that our chemical community has been influenced by the scientific thoughts of the American and British bourgeoisie for a long time, and many people support the "resonance theory." They have written some articles studying the "resonance theory" and followed the direction of the "resonance theory" in their own research. More importantly, they are promoting the "resonance theory" in university classrooms, using this anti-scientific theory to educate our young scientists. If this situation is not changed quickly, the banner of chemical theory workers will not be seen in the team participating in the great national construction in the future. This is extremely harmful to the country, the people, and science.

    Our scientific community, especially the chemical community, should learn from the example of Soviet scientists, launch discussions, thoroughly criticize the idealistic and mechanical "resonance theory," follow the correct Butlerov direction, and conduct our chemical research and chemical teaching in combination with China's actual situation on the basis of the dialectical materialist worldview.

    However, the significance of this Soviet discussion on the chemical structure theory problem for us is far more than its direct aspects.

    First, we can see that the background of this specialized chemical problem discussion is precisely the struggle between two worldviews—materialism and idealism. Because, although natural science itself is not class-based, natural scientists are always members of the social class, and their scientific research inevitably reflects the philosophical worldview of a certain social class. This is an objective fact that cannot be denied in any way. Therefore, consciously learning the proletarian worldview—dialectical materialism. Actively struggling against the bourgeois worldview of idealism in scientific theory in order to defend the healthy development of true science is a task that every advanced scientist should undertake.

    However, some people say: "Scientists do not understand philosophy, and philosophers do not understand science. It is not clear to argue, so it is better to live in peace." This statement is harmful. In fact, this is to reject the leadership of proletarian thought over scientific work, that is, to "live in peace" with the bourgeois idealistic thought, which will hinder the development of science. It is true that our scientists may not know much about Marxist-Leninist philosophy, but this further proves the necessity of strengthening learning.

    Second, at the opening speech of this chemical problem discussion meeting, Academician Dubinin quoted Comrade Stalin's instruction: "Without debates with different opinions and without free criticism, no science can develop and progress." The chemical structure theory problem itself was also proposed, enthusiastically discussed, deepened step by step, and finally some basic problems were solved in the debate, thus promoting scientific progress. We can clearly see this from the literature of this discussion.

    Conducting criticism and self-criticism in science is the driving force for the development of advanced science. We should learn from the example of Soviet scientists and carry out this aspect of work. If we worship the scientific "authorities" of the British and American bourgeoisie all day long and dare not criticize them; if we treat the scientific theories we are familiar with as private property, refuse others to criticize them, and think that this is dismantling our own "stage" and damaging our own "prestige"; if we replace scientific debates with various unprincipled sectarian disputes and personal prejudices, the result will only hinder the development of Chinese science. Or, if you do not think for yourself and only hope that Soviet scientists will discuss all the specific results and then copy them all, this is not the correct attitude and will also hinder the development of Chinese science.

    Advanced scientists who are responsible to the people and responsible to science should think deeply, creatively raise questions, and enthusiastically launch free discussions to promote the development of science.

    反对化学中的唯心论和机械论
    ——苏联科学界讨论有机化学中化学构造理论问题的情况和意义
    在联共中央发布关于思想问题的决议以后，近年来，苏联科学界向科学中的各种唯心的、不可知的、机械的思想，各种腐蚀着科学的资产阶级反动思想进行了不调和的斗争，并且在辩证唯物论——马列主义的世界观的基础上，大力向前推进了科学的发展。关于米丘林生物学的会议，关于巴甫洛夫学说的会议，关于太阳系天体演化学的会议，关于批判物理学中波尔、海森堡等的唯心观念的讨论等等，这些，都是苏联科学蓬勃发展的证据。
    苏联化学界的注意力，则集中在有机化学中化学构造理论的问题的讨论和对资产阶级唯心的、机械的“共振论”和“中介论”的批判。这一次讨论，从一九四九年末起，开始成为苏联全国规模的讨论，在各种杂志上发表了二十多篇讨论文章，在好几个科学机构中召开了讨论会，最后，在一九五一年六月由苏联科学院化学局召集了一次包括四百余位学者的全苏联讨论会，总结了这一次的讨论。
    化学构造理论问题之获得这样的重视，是由这个问题本身的极大的重要性，和这门理论今天所处的状况所决定的。化学构造理论，一方面，应该是总结极大量的化学事实和规律的具有高度概括性和原则的重要性的基本理论，另一方面，又应该是化学工业发展的基础，化学合成实践的指导。正因为我们已经掌握了关于化学构造的一定的知识，我们今天才有可能建立强大的化学工业，尤其是有机化学工业，例如合成橡胶、合成汽油工业、人造丝、染料、可塑料工业，才有可能合成抗生素等药剂、杀虫剂、感光剂、浮选剂等极为有用的化学制剂。离开化学构造理论，这些化学工业都是不可想像的。由此可见，在化学构造理论中进行拥护唯物的、辩证的、理论和实践联系的路线，反对唯心的、机械的、理论和实际相脱节的倾向的斗争，具有何等重要的实际意义。
    （一）
    化学构造理论的基础，是由伟大的俄国化学家亚·米·波特列洛夫在一八六一年间所奠定的。波特列洛夫的唯物的化学构造理论，随着当时俄国革命民主主义的进步思潮一道产生，并且是它的一个组成部分。同时，他的化学构造理论又是以当时所积累的大量化学事实为基础，在反对热拉尔等化学家的不可知论思想的斗争中产生出来的。
    波特列洛夫化学构造理论的基本思想是怎样的呢？
    他认为，在形成一个物体的时候，物体中的每一个化学分子都以它自己一定的化学力作用着，这种化学力作用的分配便叫做物质的化学构造，由于这种分配的结果，各化学原子直接地或间接地互相影响、联合而组成化学质点。
    他不止一次地指出，化学分子的组成部分以一定的方式联系着，同时又相互影响着，不仅要注意分子中原子和键的分布这种直接的联系和影响，同时也必需注意另一种相互联系和影响，即他所称呼的“并不直接联结的原子之间的相互影响”。
    在他的全部著作中贯穿着这样的思想：物质的化学性质，决定于其分子的化学构造。通过对化学性质的研究，我们可以认识分子的构造，反过来，根据分子的化学构造，我们可以预见物质的化学性质，判断物质的化学性质。
    他认为每一个化学分子都只有一个一定的构造，在一个分子里，不可能有好几个不同的构造并存。通过对化学性质的研究，我们认识了每个分子所独有的一定的构造，因而，便应该正确地用一个一定的构造式去反映这个分子。
    他反对了当时一些化学家把化学分子看作一堆原子的简单的堆集的机械论的意见，而把化学分子当作以一定方式联结的一群原子，这些原子相互联系，相互影响，带来性质上新的要素，使整体分子性质上不同于个体原子的简单的堆集。他反对了把化学构造当作不可认识的东西的看法，认为分子的真正构造，分子中原子的相互影响完全是可以认识的，并且可以用构造式把它反映出来；构造式应该是物质真正的构造的形象、反映和模写，而不能是任意捏造的东西。这就是波特列洛夫学说中的唯物思想，具有辩证因素的思想的实质。
    这种正确地反映了化学分子的客观实际的理论，自然能够通过实践的严格考验。它不仅解释了当时所发现的化学事实，而且预见了许多当时尚未发现的化学物质，预见了一些化学物质的异构体，指出了合成新物质的方向，它为有机化学工业的发展开辟了道路。
    在波特列洛夫的唯物思想的指导下，化学构造理论本身也不断地向前发展着。关于分子中原子相互影响及许多化学反应的研究，有机物质空间构造的学说，光学异构学说，互变学说等，都向前推进了化学构造理论。特别随着物理学的进展，电子学说、量子学说的出现，更解释了许多化学家以前从化学事实中概括出来的概念，例如解释了化学键的性质，键的饱和性的事实，分子的几何形状等，并提出了一些新的概念。在新的物理研究方法的帮助下，使得人们能够更清楚地透入化学反应的历程、原子相互影响的传导方式等，使得人们在这方面的知识大为扩展。
    波特列洛夫化学构造理论发展到今天，比起它九十年前的样子来，是要丰富得多、细致得多、深刻得多了。因此，从表面上看，十九世纪的波特列洛夫学说是“老旧”了、“不具体”了。但是，波特列洛夫学说的唯物的思想，却是常新的，却是具体的，在今天和化学中流行的“共振论”的唯心思想作斗争的时候便表现了它的威力。并且，更要指出，化学构造理论研究方面今天所获得的丰富成果，正是在波特列洛夫的唯物理论的基础上获得的。我们要珍视这一份遗产，并努力在波特列洛夫的唯物学说的基础上，继续向前发展，使之更深刻、更细致、更丰富。
    （二）
    但是，近二十年来，在有机化学的化学构造理论中流行着一种以“共振论”和“中介论”为代表的倾向。这个倾向是和波特列洛夫方向不相容的，是唯心的、机械的、在实际中完全无用的；它阻碍了科学的发展。
    “共振论”，以及和“共振论”相汇合并溶化于其中的“中介论”，以最新的物理学成就—量子力学—在化学中应用而产生的理论自居。它用这样的旗帜，欺骗了许多轻信的化学家，因而获得了颇大的流传。但实质上，“共振论”完全不是什么量子力学的结果，而是对量子力学和化学的投机。“共振论”利用了量子力学计算分子的某一种近似方法中函数的平直组合（即一个函数等于许多其他的函数的和）这一特点，没有根据地硬说每一个作为被加项的函数都代表分子的一个“构造”，而认为分子中客观存在着许多这样的“构造”，（例如说苯有五个，萘有四十二个，蒽有四百二十九个）而这种“构造”只要根据原子价规律就可以随意画出来，分子在这些“构造”之间“共振”着，而这些共振着的“构造”和其间的“共振”便决定着分子的全部性质。
    “共振论”所虚构的“构造”，事实上，只存在于“共振论”创始者的头脑之中，没有任何实验证明它们的客观存在。然而，“共振论”硬要说它们是客观存在的，而且居然在“共振”着，决定着分子的客观性质。用主观虚构代替了客观真实。这就是“共振论”的唯心论实质。
    “共振论”的创造者们似乎也感到了自己的武断，于是企图来掩饰，说：“共振概念在研究化学问题时的便利和价值如此之大，以致其存在着武断因素的缺点就没有什么关系了。”真是欲盖弥彰！这和早为列宁所粉碎了的马赫主义者的“思惟经济”原理不是如出一辙吗？根据“思惟经济”原理，衡量理论的准则，似乎并不是看它符不符合实际，而是看它便利不便利，经济不经济。
    “共振论”的错误，不仅限于唯心论，它同时还具有机械论的倾向，它企图把化学还原为量子力学。
    化学是研究物质运动的化学形态的科学，    而量子力学则是研究原子、电子等的力学的科学。化学形态的运动是高级的运动形态，电子等的力学运动是低级的运动形态。恩格斯在分析高级运动形态和低级运动形态之间的关系时曾说过：“这并不是说：每一个高级的运动形态不是经常必须和现实的机械运动（外在的或分子的）相联系，正如高级的运动形态同时还产生其他的运动形态；化学的作用没有温度和电底变化是不可能的，有机的生命没有机械的、分子的、化学的、热的、电的等等的变化是不可能的。但是，这些副次形态底存在却不能把每次的主要形态底本质包括无遗。有一天我们的确可以用实验的方法把思惟‘还原’为在脑子中的分子的和化学的运动，但是这就把思惟底本质包括无遗了吗？”
    正因为化学作用必然伴同原子、电子等的力学运动，正因为化学分子中的原子、电子同样地服从量子力学规律，所以我们并不拒绝在化学中运用量子力学。而事实上，用量子力学也的确能解决诸如计算分子能量、原子的空间位置、电子云的分布等问题。在这些问题上，量子力学计算结果与实验结果相符，这就是有力的证明。
    但是，另一方面，化学分子又并不是原子与电子的简单堆集，它具有一种原子与电子的简单堆集所不能具有的新的性质，因此，量子力学却决不能把化学“包括无遗”，化学不能还原为量子力学。例如分子反应性能、化学反应的历程与动力学等问题，那怕所牵涉的是简单的分子，也都不能只用量子力学来解决。如果一定要只用量子力学来计算，其结果当然会和实验相背谬。然而，“共振论”却企图把化学还原为量子力学，夸大量子力学的作用，自命万能，以为可以用它完全代替化学构造理论，“共振论”的拥护者甚至公开宣称“量子力学把化学问题还原为应用数学问题了”。这就是“共振论”的机械论实质。
    这样唯心的、机械的理论。在实际中，当然，不会有任何用处。它玩弄许多虚构的“构造”，造成一种似乎是解释了许多化学事实和规律的错觉，实际上却什么问题也没有解决。每当一个新的实验结果发表，不能用化学分子的已有的“构造”去解释时，他们就马上凭主观想像生造几个新的“构造”去凑合，说什么化学分子“共振”在旧的“构造”和刚才虚构的新“构造”之间，这样来解释实验结果。“共振论”就这样永远跟在实验后面，把自己的任务局限于牵强附会地“解释”现象。二十年来，“共振论”从来没有预见过任何一种新的有机物，没有预见过任何分子特性，也就是说，从来没有用实践证明过自己的正确性。毛主席在“实践论”中说：“马克思主义者认为，只有人们的社会实践，才是人们对于外界认识的真理性的标准。实际的情形是这样的，只有在社会实践过程中（物质生产过程中，阶级斗争过程中，科学实验过程中），人们达到了思想中所预想的结果时，人们的认识才被证实了。人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。……判定认识或理论之是否真理，不是依主观上觉得如何而定，而是依客观上社会实践的结果如何而定。真理的标准只能是社会的实践。”而在实践中，“共振论”完全破产了。它只是其创始者们认为很“便利”的理论，却并不合于客观外界、客观化学分子运动的规律。
    “共振论”使许多化学家的精力耗费在玩弄虚构的“构造”之间，脱离实际，荒废了切实的研究工作，把生产发展和科学发展所提出的重要实际任务弃置不顾，损害了人民的利益。“共振论”的实际危害性正在这里。
    应该指出，化学中的共振论倾向并不是一个孤立的现象。它和其他科学部门中的反动倾向是密切关联着的。唯心论、马赫主义、脱离实际这正是各门科学中反动倾向的共同的特点。早为列宁所粉碎了的
    “物理学”的唯心论至今还大量散布在物理学中，而且充当着“共振论”的始祖和朋友。而机械论，也正是各种反动思想的方法论的特点。把社会生活还原为生物学，把生物学还原为化学，把化学还原为力学和数学，在这一套还原的“锁链”中，“共振论”是一个重要的环节。
    “共振论”和其他各门科学中的唯心理论共同组成了一个反动的战线，来反对唯物论。科学中唯心论与唯物论的斗争，归根结蒂，正反映着两个阶级
    （资产阶级与无产阶级）、两种社会制度和两个阵营的斗争，这就是这一斗争的阶级基础和社会背景。

    那么，抛弃了反科学的“共振论”，化学构造理论今后发展的方向是什么呢？
    苏联科学界关于化学构造理论问题讨论大会的决定中写得很清楚：
    “讨论会认为必须全力发展有机化学理论部门的工作。有机化学的主要方向是合成的方向，以及随之而来的用合成有机化学方法研究有机物——其中包括天然有机物——的性质与构造。在化学合成中最明显地表现了理论与实践的联系。并且，在合成工作中经常地证实着和深化着构造理论，扩大了构造理论的应用范围。在合成方向中，构造理论可以找到发展的新动力。
    “讨论会指出，理论有机化学的最重要的任务便是创造性地发展波特列洛夫学说，根据现代的物质构造概念，深化与扩大波特列洛夫学说的基本原则。理论有机化学的发展，首先是化学构造理论的发展，必须在辩证唯物论的世界观基础上，在坚决地与化学中唯心的与机械的理论作斗争中进行。
    “苏维埃学者的注意力必须集中于深入与扩大对物质化学构造的认识，集中于发展分子中原子相互影响的理论。必须研究分子反应性能与构造和介质的关系问题。研究元素的过程问题，以及反应——其中包括催化反应——的历程与动力学问题，具有非常重大的意义。研究有机物的化学的、物理的、生理的及其他的性质和其构造的关系也是最重要的任务。“为了完成化学构造理论的任务，除了运用光辉地证明了自己之有效的化学的研究方法和道路外，必须更广泛地注意有关的科学部门中的一切成就，首先是现代物理学及其实验的与理论的方法的一切财富。……
    “讨论会认为，物理的研究方法在有机化学中还没有得到应有的运用。讨论会认为，必须广泛地运用光谱分析的、电子摄谱的、质谱仪的以及其他的方法来研究有机化合物的构造与性质，发展化学构造理论的任务要求探求适应于这些任务的特点的各个新的物理学的和物理化学的研究方法。讨论会号召物理学家和物理化学家积极地参加寻求这些方法。……
    “苏维埃物理学理论家和数学家必须最积极地参加研究理论化学问题和量子力学计算方法问题。只有化学家和物理学家通力合作，化学构造理论才能成为波特列洛夫所号召建立的定量的理论。……”
    显然，运用一切理论的和实验的研究方法，运用
    一切现代物理学的和化学的方法，与各个部门的科学家通力合作，密切联系着实际，在辩证唯物论的基础上发展波特列洛夫理论，和一切唯心倾向作斗争，这就是化学构造理论向前发展的方向。
    朝这个方向走，需要做许多的切实工作，比起“共振论”之玩弄虚构的“构造”来，这是要艰难得多的。这是一个艰难的，然而光荣的任务，是人民要求科学家负担起来，予以解决的任务。进步的科学家一定会勇敢地负担起这一任务，在马克思列宁主义思想光辉的照耀下，胜利地前进。

    苏联科学界这次关于化学构造理论问题的讨论，对于我们中国科学界具有什么意义呢？
    首先，最直接的意义便是帮助中国的科学家们摆脱“共振论”的唯心影响。
    应该说，我们的化学界过去长期受了美英资产阶级科学思想的影响，有许多人是拥护“共振论”的。他们写过一些研究“共振论”的文章，在自己的研究中遵循“共振论”的方向。更重要的是，他们在大学讲堂中宣传着“共振论”，用这种反科学的理论来教育我们的科学青年。如果这种情况还不迅速改变，那么，在今后参加国家伟大建设的队伍中，将看不见化学理论工作者的旗帜。这是对国家、对人民、对科学极为有害的事情。
    我们的科学界，特别是化学界，应该学习苏联科学家的榜样，展开讨论，彻底批判唯心的、机械的“共振论”，遵循正确的波特列洛夫的方向，在辩证唯物论世界观的基础上，结合着中国的实际，来进行我们的化学研究和化学教学。
    但是，苏联这一次关于化学构造理论问题的讨论，对于我们的意义，远不限于它直接的方面。
    第一、我们可以看到，作为这次专门化学问题讨论的背景的，正是两种世界观——唯物论和唯心论的斗争。因为，自然科学本身虽然是没有阶级性的，但自然科学家却总是社会阶级的一分子，在他的科学研究中也就必然反映了一定社会阶级的哲学世界观。这是无论如何也否认不了的客观事实。因此，自觉地学习无产阶级的世界观——辩证唯物论。积极地向科学理论中资产阶级的世界观——唯心论作斗争，以保卫真正科学的健康发展，是每一个先进的科学家应该承当的任务。
    然而，有人说：“科学家不懂哲学，哲学家不懂科学，那是吵不清楚的，还是相安无事为妙。”这种说法是有害的，实际上，这就是拒绝无产阶级思想对科学工作的领导，就是要和资产阶级的唯心论思想“相安无事”，就会阻碍科学的发展。不错，我们的科学家对于马克思列宁主义哲学的确可能不很懂得，但这就更加证明了加强学习的必要。
    第二、这次化学问题讨论会上，杜宾宁院士的开幕辞一开始便引用了斯大林同志的指示：“如果没有不同意见的争论，没有自由的批评，任何科学都不可能发展，不可能进步的。”而化学构造理论问题本身也就是在争论中被提出，热烈展开讨论，一步步深入，最后获得一些基本问题的解决，因而推动科学进步的。我们从这次讨论的文献中可以清楚地看出这一点。
    在科学中展开批评和自我批评，是先进科学发展的动力。我们应该学习苏联科学家的榜样，展开这一方面的工作。如果终日膜拜英美资产阶级的科学“权威”，不敢稍加批评；如果把自己所熟悉的科学理论当作私人财产，拒绝别人批评，以为这便是拆自己的“台”，损害自己的“威信”；如果把各种无原则的宗派纠纷、个人成见，代替科学上的争论，那结果，只会阻挠中国科学的发展。或者，自己不去思索，只希望苏联科学家讨论出一切具体结果，然后再全套搬过来，这也不是正确的态度，也会妨碍中国科学的发展。
    对人民负责，对科学负责的先进的科学家，应该深刻地思索，创造性地提出问题，热烈地展开自由讨论，以促进科学的发展。
