    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 27th—Li Xuesan, head of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, and Hong Chun-chul, head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, who are currently giving reports to the people of Hangzhou, protest the heinous crime of the American aggressors using bacteriological weapons in Korea. Li Xuesan, head of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, said: "I strongly protest against the heinous crime of the American aggressors spreading a large number of bacteria in Korea. The American aggressors used inhumane bacteriological weapons in Korea very early on, but it did not save them from their fate of defeat. They have been severely hit by the Chinese and Korean People's forces and justly condemned by the people of the world. This time when we return to our motherland, we will report to the people of our motherland all the inhuman crimes committed by the American aggressors in Korea. We want to firmly express to the people of our motherland: all the conspiracies and tricks of the American aggressors cannot scare us, and we are determined to strive for a fair and reasonable peaceful settlement of the Korean issue!" Hong Chun-chul, head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, said: "As far back as the Second World War, the German and Japanese fascists also used bacteriological weapons in their wars of aggression, but in the end, they still could not save themselves from defeat. This time, the American imperialists are going to follow the old path of the German and Japanese fascists, and they will certainly be subjected to even more severe punishment by history. The Chinese and Korean people will unite more closely and resolutely smash all the vicious conspiracies of the American imperialists." Xia Guang, a member of the Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, said: "After the Battle of Hengcheng last year, I followed the troops to the area south of Chuncheon and saw that many villagers were suffering from epidemic typhus or relapsing fever. The residents told us that the American aggressors had left some clothes in the houses when they retreated, and those who wore these clothes got sick. Obviously, this was a murderous trick of the American aggressors." Kim Ro-ting and Kim Chung-rae, representatives of the Korean People's Delegation to China, said that they had found many residents suffering from epidemic typhus, smallpox, relapsing fever, and other infectious diseases in Ripseok-dong, Gacheon County, Taepyeong-dong, Deokcheon County, Hwacheon, Inje, and Gimhwa. In a place called Yuktang-ri, more than seventy households all had people suffering from infectious diseases. These places had all been occupied by the American aggressor troops. Soon after this group of beasts fled, the local residents began to suffer from deadly infectious diseases. The representatives expressed their immense anger at this inhuman atrocity of the American aggressor troops. They said: "This criminal act of the American aggressors will inevitably be severely punished by our Korean and Chinese People's forces and the people of the world."
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th—All the medical personnel of the 7th Detachment of the Chinese Red Cross International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service Team, who are engaged in medical and epidemic prevention work on the Korean battlefield, issued a statement on the 25th, protesting the heinous crime of the American aggressors spreading a large number of bacteria-carrying insects in the front and rear areas of Korea. The statement said: We have personally witnessed in Korea that on the one hand, the American aggressors are intensifying their indiscriminate bombing and shooting of schools, hospitals, houses, and innocent residents in Korea and spreading toxic bacteria, etc.; on the other hand, the Korean and Chinese People's forces and the Korean people are unyieldingly and resolutely resisting the aggressors in a heroic and strong just struggle. We firmly believe that no matter how vicious and brutal the atrocities of the aggressors are, they can never scare the peace-loving people. We, all the medical personnel, strongly protest against the new heinous crimes committed by the aggressors in Korea, demand that the peace-loving people of the world impose just sanctions on the aggressors, and are determined to further strengthen our epidemic prevention work and resolutely and thoroughly crush the shameless conspiracy of the American bandits.
    
    The detachment has decided to hold a joint epidemic prevention meeting with a certain hospital of the Korean People's Army within the next few days to specifically discuss the thorough elimination of the bacteria-carrying insects spread by the American aggressors and to conduct epidemic prevention propaganda to nearby residents.

    【新华社杭州二十七日电】正在杭州市向广大人民作报告的中国人民志愿军归国代表团团长李雪三和朝鲜人民访华代表团团长洪淳哲等抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜使用细菌武器的滔天罪行。中国人民志愿军归国代表团团长李雪三说：“我对美国侵略者在朝鲜大量撒布细菌的滔天罪行，提出严重抗议。美国侵略者在朝鲜很早就使用过灭绝人性的细菌武器，但并没有挽救了它失败的命运。它受到了中朝人民部队沉重的打击和世界人民正义的声讨。我们这次回到祖国，就要向祖国人民报告美国侵略者在朝鲜所制造的各种惨无人道的罪恶行为。我们要向祖国人民坚决表示：美国侵略者的一切阴谋诡计是吓不倒我们的，我们决心为争取朝鲜问题的公平合理的和平解决而努力！”朝鲜人民访华代表团团长洪淳哲说：“远在第二次世界大战期间，德、日法西斯也在侵略战争中使用了细菌武器，结果仍然不能挽救他们的失败。这次美帝国主义者又要走德、日法西斯的老路，一定会受到历史的更严厉的惩罚。中朝人民将更亲密地团结起来，坚决粉碎美帝国主义者的一切毒辣阴谋。”志愿军归国代表夏光说：“去年横城战役以后，我曾随部队到了春川以南地区，见到许多村庄的居民害着斑疹伤寒或回归热。居民对我们说：美国侵略军在撤退时，曾在房子里留下一些衣服，穿了这些衣服的人都得了病。显然这是美国侵略军的杀人毒计。”朝鲜人民访华代表团代表金路丁、金忠来说，他们曾在价川郡立石洞、德川郡太平洞、华川、麟蹄、金化等地发现许多居民都害斑疹伤寒、天花、回归热等传染病。一个叫做六堂里的地方共有七十多户居民，家家都有人得了传染病。这些地方都被美国侵略军占领过的。当这群野兽溃逃后不久，当地居民便害起致命的传染病来了。代表们对美侵略军这种惨无人道的暴行，感到无比的愤怒。他们说：“美国侵略者这种罪恶行为，必然会受到我朝中人民部队和世界人民的严惩。”
    【新华社平壤二十六日电】在朝鲜战地从事医疗防疫工作的中国红十字会国际医防服务队第七大队的全体医护人员在二十五日发表声明，抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜前线后方大量撒布细菌毒虫的滔天罪行。声明中说：我们在朝鲜亲眼看到：一方面是美国侵略者变本加厉地对朝鲜的学校、医院、民房、无辜居民进行狂炸滥射和撒布毒性细菌等种种暴行；一方面是朝中人民部队、朝鲜人民不屈不挠地坚决反抗侵略者的英勇坚强的正义斗争。我们坚决相信，侵略者的任何穷凶极恶的野兽暴行也决不能把爱好和平的人民吓倒。我们全体医护工作者严重抗议侵略者在朝鲜所制造的新的滔天罪行，要求全世界爱好和平的人民对侵略者予以正义的制裁，并决心进一步加强我们的防疫工作，坚决彻底地粉碎美国强盗的无耻阴谋。
    该大队已决定在日内和朝鲜人民军某医院举行联合防疫会议，具体讨论彻底消灭美国侵略者所撒布的细菌毒虫，和向附近居民进行防疫宣传等问题。
