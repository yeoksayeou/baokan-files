Reader's Letter:

The profiteer Wang Ruixi and others should be punished for illegally profiting by stealing and replacing materials during commissioned processing.

Editor: In the winter of 1949 and the spring of 1950, the government, in order to support farmers in developing agricultural production, allocated a large sum of money to purchase raw materials for manufacturing waterwheels and entrusted the iron factories such as Beijing Chun Ji, Gong Ji, Guang Sheng Yong, and Guang Cheng to process and manufacture them. However, these unscrupulous merchants, in order to obtain huge illegal profits, were so unconscionable as to use the method of "replacing the beams and pillars," replacing most of the No. 3 gray pig iron supplied by the government with machine iron or white pig iron. For example, Chun Ji factory stole and replaced more than 60 tons of the more than 100 tons of gray pig iron it received; Gong Ji stole and replaced more than 80 tons of the more than 120 tons of gray pig iron it received; other iron factories such as Yong Li, Guang Sheng Yong, and Guang Cheng also had situations where gray pig iron was stolen and replaced. As a result, many of these custom-made waterwheels were damaged shortly after being distributed to rural areas. The government's prestige among farmers has also been greatly affected. During the anti-bribery and anti-theft campaign, these unscrupulous merchants not only failed to confess and repent, but also tried to muddle through by using despicable methods. For example, when the masses asked Wang Ruixi, the manager of Guang Cheng Iron Factory, to confess, he talked nonsense and slandered the government; when the workers asked the manager of Guang Sheng Yong to confess, this unscrupulous merchant slandered the workers, saying that the workers' thinking was not good. We suggest that the government severely punish these unscrupulous merchants who are determined to be enemies of the people.

    奸商王瑞玺等在委托加工中
    偷换工料非法牟利应予惩办
    编辑同志：在一九四九年冬天和一九五零年春天，政府为了扶助农民发展农业生产，拿出了一大笔钱购买制造水车的原料，交给北京市纯记、恭记、广盛永、广成等铁工厂加工制造水车。但这些奸商为了大量牟取非法利润，竟丧尽天良，用抽梁换柱的方法，把政府供给的三号灰生铁大部分换成机器铁或白生铁。如纯记工厂在领去的一百多吨灰生铁中，就偷换了六十吨以上；恭记领去一百二十多吨灰生铁也偷换了八十多吨；其他如永利、广盛永、广成等铁工厂都有偷换灰生铁的情况。因而，这批订制的水车，在发到农村后使用不久，就损坏了很多。政府在农民中的威信也因此受到了很大影响。在反行贿、反盗窃运动中，这些奸商不但不坦白悔过，反用卑鄙方法企图蒙混过关。如广成铁工厂经理王瑞玺，群众叫他坦白时，他却满嘴胡说，并污蔑政府；当工人提出要广盛永经理坦白时，这个奸商竟污蔑工人，说工人思想不好。我们建议政府严厉制裁这些立意和人民为敌的奸商。
