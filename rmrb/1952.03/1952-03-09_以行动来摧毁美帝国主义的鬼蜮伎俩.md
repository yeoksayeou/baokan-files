    Destroy the Diabolical Tricks of U.S. Imperialism with Action
    Zhang Jingyue, Provost of Peking University, Dean of the College of Science

    Since launching its war of aggression against Korea, U.S. imperialism has been slaughtering people and massacring prisoners of war. Recently, it has even more inhumanly used bacteriological weapons. The enemy's crimes are deepening day by day. In the past ten days, it has frantically invaded our Northeast with airplanes many times, spreading large amounts of toxic bacteria, killing and wounding the people, and unscrupulously expanding the war of aggression to our territory. This proves even more that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and the mortal enemy of the people of the world. At the beginning of the Korean War, the arrogant aggressors believed that they could win with steel. After this attempt suffered a shameful defeat under the counterattack of the brave Chinese and Korean soldiers, they妄想妄想妄想妄想to intimidate the world with atomic bombs, but they were overwhelmed by the solemn statement of Marshal Stalin. Now the enemy is desperate, completely abandoning its mask, revealing its true colors, and actually using bacteriological weapons that are intolerable to the people of the whole world. This extremely despicable crime is precisely the last struggle of imperialism. When violence fails, they resort to treachery; when tigers and wolves are useless, they turn into snakes and scorpions. The more despicable, the weaker.
    Conversely, the invincible power of the Chinese people is becoming more and more apparent. The people of the whole country are supporting the just war. Recently, our medical and health workers have organized themselves to go to Korea to carry out anti-bacterial warfare work. Today, the enemy is more frantically expanding the germ warfare to our sacred land. We should take action to give the evil enemy a merciless blow. Not only should medical and health workers participate in this battle, but I believe that all those who have received general biological training can effectively participate. The teachers and students of the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences of Peking University have today signed a petition requesting the government to give them combat missions. It is believed that biological scientists, teachers and students of biological science throughout the country will rise up, prepare to respond to the call, and rush to the front line to take on the task of preventing poisoning and eliminating bacteria, to defend the people and to crush the diabolical tricks of the evil enemy.

    以行动来摧毁美帝国主义的鬼蜮伎俩
    北京大学教务长理学院院长  张景钺
    美帝国主义自发动侵朝战争以来，屠戮人民，残杀战俘，近来更灭绝人性使用细菌武器，敌人的罪孽，与日俱深。近十天更疯狂地多次用飞机侵入我东北，撒布大量毒菌，杀伤人民，肆无忌惮地将侵略战争扩大到我国领土，更十足证明美帝国主义是我中国人民的死敌，是全世界人民的死敌。侵朝战争初期，狂妄的侵略者，相信可以钢铁赢得胜利。这企图在中朝英勇战士反击之下遭受可耻失败之后，又妄想以原子弹恫吓世界，但被斯大林大元帅严正的声明压倒。现在敌人发急了，完全抛去假面具，原形毕露，竟大量使用全世界人民所不容许的细菌武器。这种极端卑鄙的罪行，正是帝国主义最后挣扎的表现。暴力不行，改用阴毒，虎狼无用，变为蛇蝎，愈卑鄙也愈软弱。
    相反地，我中国人民一天天更鲜明地表现不可战胜的力量。全国人民都在支援正义的战争。最近我们的医药卫生工作者已组织起来到朝鲜作反细菌战的工作。今天敌人更疯狂地将细菌战争扩大到我们神圣的土地上来。我们更应行动起来，予万恶的敌人以无情打击。不单是医药卫生工作人员应当参加这个战役，我认为凡是受过一般生物学训练的人们都可以有效地参加。北京大学动植物系的师生今天已经签名请求政府给予战斗任务。相信全国的生物科学工作者，生物科学的教师和学生们都会起来，准备响应号召，奔赴前线担任防毒灭菌的任务。保卫人民，粉碎万恶敌人的鬼蜮伎俩。
