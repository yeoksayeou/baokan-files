    Shandong Province People's Government has decided to establish a large-scale state-owned mechanized farm in the coastal area of ​​the Yellow River estuary, belonging to the three counties of Guangrao, Lijin, and Kenli. The area where the Yellow River enters the sea in Shandong Province is a vast fertile plain formed by the silt of the Yellow River. However, the terrain is low-lying, often subject to tidal flooding, with saline and alkaline soil, making it difficult for crops to grow. Therefore, large areas of the beach are sparsely populated and covered with weeds. Last October, the Shandong Provincial Yellow River Water Conservancy Bureau built a spring flood overflow dam project on the south bank of the Yellow River embankment in Xiaojiezi Village, Lijin County, which can divert Yellow River water to irrigate 400,000 mu of farmland, preparing the conditions for reclaiming this fertile wasteland. In late December last year, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Shandong Provincial People's Government and the Shandong Provincial Yellow River Water Conservancy Bureau and other departments dispatched more than 150 cadres to form a surveying team to actively conduct farm surveying work. By mid-January of this year, more than 100,000 mu of wasteland that could be reclaimed had been surveyed.
    Currently, the preparatory work for this farm has taken initial shape. It is actively establishing farm organizations, opening up farm sites, and purchasing farming machinery. Land reclamation can begin within this month. The farm plans to reclaim 600,000 mu of wasteland within three years, with 200,000 mu to be reclaimed in the first year. The total output value of the farm this year is expected to reach 20 million catties of millet. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山东黄河入海处将建立国营农场
    山东省人民政府已决定在黄河入海处属于广饶、利津、垦利三县的临海地区，建立一个大规模的国营机械化农场。山东省黄河入海的地方，是一大片由黄河泥沙淤成的沃野。但该地地势低洼，常受海潮侵溢，水咸地碱，农作物不易生长，因此大片的海滩人烟稀少，一片荒草。去年十月间，山东省黄河河务局在利津县小街子村黄河大堤南岸，修建了一座可引黄水灌溉四十万亩农田的凌汛溢水堰工程，便为开垦这片肥沃的荒地准备了条件。去年十二月下旬，山东省人民政府农林厅和山东省黄河河务局等部门已抽调干部一百五十多人，组成测量队积极进行农场勘测工作，到今年一月中旬，已测量好即可开垦的十多万亩荒地。
    现在，这个农场的筹备工作已初具规模，正在积极地建立农场机构，开辟场址和购买耕作机械，本月内就可着手垦荒。该场计划在三年内垦荒六十万亩，今年第一年先垦二十万亩。今年农场的生产总值预计可达两千万斤小米。　　　　　　（新华社）
