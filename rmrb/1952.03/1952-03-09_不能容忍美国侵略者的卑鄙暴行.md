Cannot Tolerate the Despicable Atrocities of the American Aggressors
Ma Dayou, Dean of the Engineering College of Peking University

    After the American imperialists spread bacteria in Korea, they have also spread a large number of bacteria in the Northeast of our motherland for several consecutive days. This is an intolerable act. The use of bacteria is expressly prohibited by international law and is a barbaric act that all civilized human beings cannot tolerate. This inhuman, cannibalistic act does not show the strength of the imperialists; on the contrary, it shows their cowardice and shamelessness. It also makes us recognize the true face of American science. American science is being shamelessly used by monopoly capitalists and imperialist elements to attempt to destroy humanity. This is American civilization! This is the American way of life! After suffering serious setbacks in the war of aggression against Korea, the American aggressors were forced to accept peace talks, but in the talks, they repeatedly used various rogue tactics to create obstacles and delay the progress of the negotiations. This time, because they could not win in the negotiations, they vainly attempted to use germ warfare to intimidate us. We have long recognized the hideous face of the American imperialists. We will not be intimidated. We will uphold justice, fight to the end, and destroy all the conspiracies of the American imperialists.
    This shameless atrocity of the American imperialists is a serious provocation to human civilization and should be severely punished by the people of the world. I cannot bear it anymore. I cannot watch the beloved compatriots of our motherland suffer the inhuman killings of the imperialists. I am determined to respond to all the calls of the government with practical actions.

    不能容忍美国侵略者的卑鄙暴行
    北京大学工学院院长  马大猷
    美帝国主义者在朝鲜撒布细菌后，又在祖国的东北连续几天撒布大量细菌，这是不可容忍的行为。使用细菌是国际公法所明文禁止的，是一切文明人类所不能容许的野蛮行为。这种灭绝人性的食人生番行径不是表明帝国主义者的力量强大，相反地，这表明它的怯懦和无耻。这也使我们认识美国科学的真象，美国科学就是这样被垄断资本家和帝国主义分子无耻地利用来企图毁灭人类的，这就是美国文明！这就是美国生活方式！美国侵略者在侵略朝鲜的战争中遭受严重的挫败后，被迫接受和平谈判，但是在谈判中还是一再地用种种无赖手段节外生枝地拖延谈判的进行。这次因为在谈判中不能得到胜利，又妄图用细菌战争来吓倒我们，我们早已认识了美帝国主义者的狰狞面目，我们是吓不倒的，我们要坚持正义，斗争到底，摧毁美帝国主义者的一切阴谋诡计。
    美帝国主义者这次的无耻暴行是对人类文明的严重挑衅，应该受全世界人民的严厉制裁。我不能忍受了，我不能看着祖国的亲爱同胞遭受帝国主义者的惨无人道的杀害，我决心以实际行动响应政府的一切号召。
