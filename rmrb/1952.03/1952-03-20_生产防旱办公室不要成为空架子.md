    Do Not Let Production Drought Prevention Offices Become Empty Shells

    In some areas of North China, leading cadres still do not pay enough attention to drought prevention and spring plowing. Although drought prevention and production offices have been established in most counties of the Xingtai Special District in Hebei Province, the cadre strength is very weak, with few or no main cadres at the county level participating. For example, in Guangzong County, only one head of the agricultural section leads the drought prevention and production work. In Xinhe County, only a staff member is responsible for monitoring production. The Ren County Supply and Marketing Cooperative only extracted a dozen people on March 4 to engage in business, and the county bank has not yet taken action. In the Pingyuan-Huxi Special District, the drought prevention and production office is formally headed by the deputy director of the Civil Affairs Section and the secretary of the Research Office, but in reality, only one secretary of the Commissioner's Office is in charge of daily work. The office staff also concurrently manage other tasks, resulting in dispersed efforts and a lack of understanding of the situation. In many areas of Suiyuan Province, drought prevention and spring plowing work has not yet begun. Guisui County was allocated 50 million yuan in seed loans, but has not yet made a specific lending plan, nor has it determined the lending areas. The cooperative has not yet prepared to supply seeds for cash crops, and the repair of agricultural tools has basically not been done. There are currently 120,000 catties of the pesticide red arsenic, but no lending plan has been made.

    With spring plowing time becoming increasingly pressing, leading cadres in the above areas and those with similar situations should quickly take effective measures in accordance with the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government on drought prevention, drought resistance, and agricultural production, and take charge of drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing production work. Counties, districts, and townships should now use all their strength to lead spring plowing. The production drought prevention office should become the combat command headquarters for production, and should never be allowed to become an empty shell. In areas with weak cadre strength, stronger cadres familiar with agricultural production should be immediately transferred to supplement them. Cooperatives and banks in various places should immediately strengthen the supply of fertilizers, the allocation of seeds, the repair of agricultural tools, the issuance of agricultural loans, and the advance purchase of cotton, and use their greatest strength to serve spring plowing production.

    生产防旱办公室不要成为空架子
    华北有些地区的领导干部，对于防旱、春耕工作，到现在仍然不够重视。河北邢台专区大部县份的防旱生产办公室虽已成立，但干部力量非常薄弱，县级主要干部参加的很少，甚至没有参加。如：广宗县仅有一个农业科长领导防旱生产工作。新河县只是由一个科员负责掌握生产。任县供销合作社三月四日才抽出十几个人来搞业务，县银行还没行动起来。平原湖西专区防旱生产办公室形式上由民政科副科长、研究室秘书等分任正副主任，实际上仅由专署秘书一人掌握日常工作，办公室人员还兼管其他工作，以致力量分散，连情况都不了解。绥远省不少地区的防旱、春耕工作至今还未着手。归绥县分配到种籽贷款五千万元，却还没有作出具体贷发计划，也没有确定贷发地区；合作社现在还没准备供应经济作物的种籽，农具修制工作基本上还没作，现存农药红砒十二万斤，也没作出贷发计划。
    春耕时间日益紧迫，以上地区和有类似的情况的地区的领导干部，应该赶快按照中央人民政府政务院关于防旱、抗旱和农业生产的指示，迅速采取有效的措施，把防旱抗旱、春耕生产工作管起来。县、区、乡现在应当用全部力量领导春耕。生产防旱办公室应当成为生产的战斗指挥部，决不应当把它变成一个空架子。干部力量薄弱的地区，应当立即抽调熟悉农业生产的较强的干部予以补充。各地合作社和银行应即加强供应肥料、调拨种籽、修理农具、发放农贷、预购棉花等项工作，用最大的力量为春耕生产服务。
