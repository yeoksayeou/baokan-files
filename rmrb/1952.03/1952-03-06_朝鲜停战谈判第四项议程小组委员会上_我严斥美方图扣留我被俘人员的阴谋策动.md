Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 5th: At the sub-committee meeting on the fourth agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on March 5, our representative solemnly pointed out that our side has sufficient materials to prove that while the other side insisted on its unreasonable "voluntary repatriation" claim at the meeting, it was also instigating and condoning its partners in the other side's prisoner-of-war camps to carry out conspiracies, attempting to detain our captured personnel. The consequences of this kind of incitement are extremely serious. Our representative once again declared our side's firm position, absolutely not agreeing to the other side's unreasonable claim of "voluntary repatriation" or "no forced repatriation." We resolutely oppose the other side's absurd practice of "reclassifying" our captured personnel as civilians. Our representative further stated that, in order to seek a reasonable solution to the current problem, the proper path is not for the other side to overturn the agreed or determined materials regarding prisoners of war, create extraneous issues, and delay the meeting, but rather to be based on the agreed or determined prisoner-of-war materials, first determine the principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war, and move forward to gradually seek a solution to the problem.
    At the staff meeting on the third agenda item, the other side still unreasonably refused to accept our reasonable plan on the issue of neutral nation nominations and the issue of rotation and ports, and the meeting made no progress.

    朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程小组委员会上
    我严斥美方图扣留我被俘人员的阴谋策动
    【新华社开城五日电】三月五日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程小组委员会上，我方代表严正指出，我方掌握着充分的材料证明对方一面在会场上坚持其毫无理由的“自愿遣返”主张；一面在对方的战俘营里唆使和纵容他们的伙伴进行阴谋策动，妄图扣留我方被俘人员。这种策动的后果，是带着极大的严重性的。我方代表再一次声明我方坚决的立场，绝对不能同意对方的“自愿遣返”，或“不得强迫遣返”的无理主张。坚决反对对方将我方被俘人员“重行分类”，作为平民的荒谬作法。我方代表进一步表示，为了求得目前问题的合理解决，正当的道路不是对方推翻已经协议或已经确定的关于战俘的材料，节外生枝做翻案文章，拖延会议，而是应该以已经协议或已经确定的战俘材料为基础，首先确定释放和遣返全部战俘的原则，向前进展，以逐步求得问题的解决。
    第三项议程参谋会议上，对方仍然无理拒绝接受我方在中立国提名问题及轮换与口岸问题上的合理方案，会议毫无进展。
