    Swiftly Help Cotton Farmers Overcome Financial Difficulties in Spring Ploughing Production

    Spring ploughing is about to begin in various regions, and cotton farmers in some cotton-producing areas urgently need to sell their stored cotton in exchange for production materials. For example, recently in Handan, Hebei, the amount of cotton entering the market is very large, and cotton farmers are requesting the cooperatives to purchase cotton worth approximately 300 million yuan per day. However, the Handan Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company has only allocated 100 million yuan for cotton purchases, which is far from the amount requested by the cotton farmers. Many cotton farmers are unable to buy essential production materials such as farm implements and fertilizers because they cannot sell their stored cotton. This situation exists in other places as well.

    In order to guarantee the realization of this year's agricultural production increase plan, the problem of farmers' lack of funds for production must be solved first. To this end, the cotton, yarn and cloth companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in these regions must cooperate with spring ploughing, expand and strengthen their business operations, allocate sufficient funds, purchase large quantities of cotton, and supply farmers with the necessary production materials for spring ploughing. This is a serious task that cannot be delayed. If there is a shortage of funds for purchasing cotton, a request should be made to the higher-level authorities for allocation; the higher-level authorities must also seriously and promptly resolve this issue. At the same time, there should be a clear division of labor between the anti-corruption struggle and business operations, and a group of clean and capable personnel should be assigned to strengthen business operations. If the economic departments in these places do not promptly and effectively solve the current difficulties of cotton farmers in selling cotton, it will hinder spring ploughing production and will also create difficulties for the development of their own business in the future, causing undue losses to the country and the people.

    迅速帮助棉农克服春耕生产中资金缺乏的困难
    各地春耕即将开始，有些产棉区的棉农急须卖出存棉，换回生产资料。例如，最近河北邯郸的棉花上市量很多，棉农要求合作社收购棉花的数量，每天约合价款三亿元。但邯郸花纱布公司却只拨给购棉款一亿元，和棉农要求收购的数量相差甚远。不少棉农因卖不掉存棉，无法买进农具肥料等必需生产资料。这种情形在其他地方也有。
    为了保证实现今年的农业增产计划，首先必须解决农民生产当中资金缺乏的问题。为此，这些地区的花纱布公司和供销合作社，必须配合春耕，扩大和加强业务工作，调配充裕的资金，大量收购棉花，并供应农民春耕必需的生产资料。这是一个不容稍缓的严重任务。如果缺乏购棉资金，就应当请求上级机关拨付；上级机关也必须认真和迅速地解决这一问题。同时，反贪污斗争和业务工作应有明确的分工，应分配一批手脚干净、业务能力较强的人员，加强业务工作。这些地方的经济部门如不迅速有效地解决棉农当前的售棉困难，就将会使春耕生产受到妨碍，同时也将给今后本身业务的开展造成困难，给国家人民造成不应有的损失。
