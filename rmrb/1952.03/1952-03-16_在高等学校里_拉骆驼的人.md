    "The Camel Pullers" in Universities
    Jì Chūyáng
    The itinerant doctor in "The Travels of Lao Ts'an," Lao Ts'an, uses a "hand-cranked bell." I think that's probably like how in Beijing, the people who "sharpen knives and scissors" "blow a horn" and the people who "collect scrap" "beat a small drum." They're all just using the noise of a tool to replace a "shout," and using it to distinguish their trade. But in my hometown, there used to be a type of traveling doctor who sold fake medicine, and they would lead a camel by hand. Because my hometown doesn't have camels, and the people of my hometown rarely see camels, these traveling doctors who sold fake medicine would spare no effort to painstakingly travel from distant provinces where camels are found, and then use this camel as a kind of signboard, leading it conspicuously through villages, using it to attract the masses. According to these quack doctors' boasts, they used some kind of "magic weapon" to "subdue" this "golden camel" in some "remote mountain cave." After this "golden camel" ate his "elixir," it could "neither eat nor drink," and still walk as healthy as usual. Thus, this camel was seen as a "treasure," and this quack doctor became a "semi-immortal" or "extraordinary person." And thus, this quack doctor could not only lead the camel to sell fake medicine and profit at people's expense, but could also eat and live anywhere, receiving great respect. But it goes without saying that fake medicine can't cure diseases, and some patients who took fake medicine would either get worse or simply "kick the bucket." So, over time, these quack doctors were finally exposed by the people of my hometown, who said they were "selling something under false pretenses," or generally referred to them as "camel pullers." The meaning is that these traveling doctors who sell fake medicine are leading a camel as a "signboard," as swindlers "selling something under false pretenses."
    Among our university teachers, it is said that many have "studied" or obtained "degrees" in capitalist countries in Europe and America. However, through the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns, due to the students' bold exposures, a class of teachers has been discovered among these people who have "studied" or obtained "degrees": they went to capitalist countries in Europe and America to "study" or get a "degree" mainly to use the "overseas student" or "degree" brand as a tool to "hunt for fame and profit" and "deceive people for a living." Because our country used to be a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, in the old China that was semi-feudal and semi-colonial, there were not many people who could go to capitalist countries in Europe and America to "study" and get "degrees." Therefore, the "overseas student" and so-called "degree" brands would be seen as "treasures" by many Chinese people, especially by many young students, just like the "golden camel" in the eyes of people in my hometown where there are no camels. If these people then took the "overseas student" and so-called "degree" brand, beat the drums, and made a grandstanding speech, it would, of course, be even easier to make people feel that he is indeed a "learned" "scholar" and "expert," inspiring "utmost admiration" and attracting some to "come at the sound of his name." But in reality, these types of teachers don't have any "knowledge" or "skills." Among them, some just spout nonsense and slander when lecturing, and some are even extremely low-level and reactionary.
    So I think that such a class of teachers might as well be called "camel pullers" in universities. Perhaps these "camel pullers" are more harmful to the people than those doctors who lead camels to sell fake medicine. Because they are "models for others," their work is ideological work. They have already "cultivated" many "ruined" or "half-ruined" "talents" for our motherland (as some students complained), even though they have already been exposed.

### 在高等学校里“拉骆驼的人”

    在高等学校里“拉骆驼的人”
    纪初阳
    “老残游记”里的老残行医是“手摇串铃”，我想，那大约就像在北京地方“磨刀磨剪子”的人“吹喇叭”和“收买破烂”的人“敲小鼓”一样，都不过是用一种器具的闹音来代替“吆喝”，并用它来区别自己的行业的。但在我的故乡从前有一种走江湖卖假药的医生，他们是手里拉着一匹骆驼。因为在我的故乡不出骆驼，故乡的人们也很难看到骆驼，所以这种走江湖卖假药的医生就不惜费尽心机，跋山涉水从远远的出骆驼的省份里弄一匹骆驼来，然后就把这骆驼当作一种幌子，拉着它招摇过村，用它来招诱群众。照这种江湖医生吹嘘，他是用了什么“法宝”才在什么“荒山古洞”里“降伏”了这匹“金骆驼”的，这匹“金骆驼”在吃了他的“仙丹妙药”之后，可以“不饮不食”，而且仍能健行如素。如此，这骆驼就被看成“宝贝”了，这江湖医生也从而成了“半仙之体”或“非凡之人”。又如此，这江湖医生不但可以拉着骆驼卖假药、牟损人之利，而且是可以到处吃住，备受恭敬。但假药治不好病是不用说了，还有的病人吃了假药是轻者转重、重者就“呜乎哀哉”了的。所以久而久之，这种江湖医生终于被故乡的人们识破，就说他们是“卖当的”，或通称为“拉骆驼的人”。那意思也就是说：这种走江湖卖假药的医生，是拉着骆驼做“幌子”、“卖当”的骗子。
    在我们的高等学校教师中，据说有不少人都是在欧美资本主义国家里“留”过“学”或得过“学位”的，但通过反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，由于同学们的大胆揭发，在这些“留”过“学”或得过“学位”的人们当中又发现了这样一类教师：他们过去所以不惜用种种办法，跑到欧美资本主义国家里去“留”一下“学”或弄一个“学位”回来，主要是为了拿这个“留学生”或“学位”之类的“洋字招牌”当做一种“猎名取利”、“骗人吃饭”的工具。因为我们的国家过去是半封建半殖民地的国家，在半封建半殖民地的旧中国，能到欧美资本主义国家去“留学”得到“学位”的人毕竟不很多，所以这“留学生”和所谓“学位”之类的“洋字招牌”，在不少中国人的眼里，特别是在不少青年学生们的眼里，那它也就会像在我那不出骆驼的故乡的人们眼里的“金骆驼”一样被看成“宝贝”了。如果这些人再拿着这“留学生”和所谓“学位”之类的
    “洋字招牌”，敲打敲打锣鼓，指天划地、吹擂一番，当然就更不难使人感到他的确是一个“满腹珠玑”的“学者”和“专家”，而不胜令人
    “仰慕之极”和有些人要“闻声而至”了。但实际上，这类教师并没有什么“学”和“术”，在他们之间，有的讲起书来不过是胡诌乱谤，甚至还有的是低级、反动到极点。
    所以我觉得，像这样的一类教师，也不妨就说他们是在高等学校里“拉骆驼的人”。也许，这种“拉骆驼的人”要比那种拉着骆驼走江湖卖假药的医生对人民更有害一些。因为他们是在“为人师表”，他们的工作是思想工作。他们已经给我们的祖国“培养”了不少“废了”或“半废了”的“人材”（如有的同学控诉时所说），虽然他们是已经被识破了。
