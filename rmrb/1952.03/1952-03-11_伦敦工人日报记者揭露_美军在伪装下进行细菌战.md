    London "Daily Worker" Reporter Reveals
    U.S. Military Conducting Germ Warfare Under Disguise
    [Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch] Alan Winnington, a reporter for the London "Daily Worker," reported from Kaesong on the 7th: In order to disguise germ warfare from civilians and troops (and perhaps their own pilots and gunners), the U.S. side used containers and airplanes similar to those used for dropping leaflets to simultaneously drop leaflets and spread bacteria-carrying insects. There is also now evidence that the U.S. side is using expert teams to go deep into the front lines to spread bacteria. Some of the containers they use are made of translucent plastic materials. They explode before landing, with a very light sound, and scatter flies, fleas, and other bacteria-carrying insects, as well as leaflets. Bacterial air raids are now occurring several times a day at and near the front lines. According to eyewitness reports, the western front area is "full of flies, ants, and fleas." There is still snow on the ground, which leads us to the conclusion that they were originally dropped there. More concrete evidence is that insects are concentrated wherever "propaganda air raids" occur. Furthermore, several species of insects they use have never been seen in these areas before.

    伦敦工人日报记者揭露
    美军在伪装下进行细菌战
    【新华社十日讯】伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿七日自开城报道：美方为了对平民和军队（或许还对他们自己的飞机驾驶员和炮手）把细菌战伪装起来，使用了那些类似供投掷传单之用的容器和飞机，来同时投掷传单和传布细菌的昆虫。现在也有证据证明美方正利用专家小组深入前线撒布细菌。他们使用的容器有一些是用半透明的塑胶材料做成的。它们在落地前就爆炸，爆炸声音很轻，并散出苍蝇、跳蚤和其他传布细菌的昆虫以及传单。现在在前线和前线附近，每天发生数次细菌空袭。据亲眼见到的人报告说，西线地区“充满了苍蝇、蚂蚁和跳蚤”。现在地上仍有积雪，这使我们只能得出这样的结论，就是：它们原是被人投在那里的，而更有形的证据就是：凡是发生“宣传空袭”的地方就有昆虫集中。此外，他们所使用的各种各样昆虫中，有若干种以前在这些地方从未见过。
