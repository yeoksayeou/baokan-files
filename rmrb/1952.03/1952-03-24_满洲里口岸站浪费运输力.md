    Manzhouli Port Station Wastes Transportation Capacity
    Editor: Manzhouli Port Station exhibits a waste of transportation capacity when transshipping imported goods. In the fourth quarter of 1951, for oil in barrels shipped from the station to a certain location, thirty-five railcars had wasted tonnage amounting to half the railcar's carrying capacity. Assuming each railcar can carry an average of thirty tons of goods, the station wasted over five hundred tons. On one occasion, the station even loaded only a little over eleven tons of goods onto a railcar with a carrying capacity of forty tons. This irresponsible attitude of the station reduces the turnover capacity of railway transportation and causes financial losses to the enterprises (cargo owners). These unreasonable phenomena are happening during the "Three-Anti" movement, which deserves our special attention. I hope the station will immediately improve this situation.
                                                                                                                                                                Wang Ping

### 满洲里口岸站浪费运输力

    满洲里口岸站浪费运输力
    编辑同志：满洲里口岸站在换装进口物资时，有浪费运输力的现象。一九五一年第四季度，该站发往某地的桶装油料，有三十五个车皮浪费的吨位竟达车皮载重量的一半。假如每个车皮平均载重三十吨物资，该站即浪费吨位五百多吨。有一次，该站甚至在载重四十吨的车皮上，只换装了十一吨多的物资。该站这种不负责任的作风，减少了铁路运输的周转能力，并使企业单位（货主）在运费上遭受损失。这些不合理的现象，竟发生在“三反”运动中，是值得我们特别注意的。希望该站立即改善这种情况。    王萍
