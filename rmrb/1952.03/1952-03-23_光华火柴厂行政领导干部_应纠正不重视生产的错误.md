    Guanghua Match Factory Administrative Leaders
    Should Correct the Mistake of Not Emphasizing Production
    Editor: The administrative leaders of the Guanghua Match Factory in Liaodong Province do not emphasize production and have serious bureaucratic work styles. Last November, workers in the phosphorous dipping workshop discovered that there were not enough "jia li ban" (夹立板 - boards for holding matchsticks), and they raised this issue to the leadership. However, the administrative leaders did not resolve this problem. It was not until production urgently required them that they told the workers to use the old, rusty "jia li ban". In January of this year, the phosphorous dipping workshop made a production plan requiring 700 sets of "jia li ban," which was approved by the factory director, but nothing happened. In mid-January, due to the lack of "jia li ban," production was about to stop. The administrative side then borrowed 600 sets of substandard "jia li ban" from another factory. As a result, the phosphorous dipping workshop only completed 89.6 percent of its original plan in January.
    Based on production needs, the phosphorous dipping workshop again made a production plan in February requiring 1,800 sets of "jia li ban." However, the situation was the same as before. Although the plan was approved, the problem remained unresolved. Factory Director Zhang Yishan told the workshop cadres: "The price of 'jia li ban' is too high now, so we can't make them." Due to the lack of "jia li ban," one splint aligning machine was used less each day in the second half of February, thus reducing a lot of output. In addition, the increase in the scrap rate and the occasional shutdown of the splint aligning machine caused a significant loss to the factory in production. I believe that treating production in this way during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is a serious mistake. The administrative leaders of the factory should publicly examine their mistakes and quickly take effective measures to change this situation.

### 光华火柴厂行政领导干部  应纠正不重视生产的错误

    光华火柴厂行政领导干部
    应纠正不重视生产的错误
    编辑同志：辽东省营光华火柴厂行政领导干部不重视生产，有严重的官僚主义作风。去年十一月，沾磷车间工人发现铗立板（铗火柴棍的）不够，即向领导方面提了意见。但行政领导干部不解决这个问题。直到生产迫切需要时，他们才叫工人拿那些生锈陈腐的旧铗立板使用。今年一月份，沾磷车间做了需要七百套铗立板的生产计划，已经厂长批准，但无任何结果。一月中旬，因铗立板不够，快要停工了，行政方面才向外厂借来了六百套不合标准的铗立板。因此，沾磷车间一月份只完成了原计划的百分之八十九点六。
    根据生产需要，沾磷车间在二月份又做出了需要铗立板一千八百套的生产计划。但是，情况和以前相同，计划尽管被批准，问题却仍不解决。厂长张义山对车间干部说：“现在铗立板的价格太高了，不能做。”由于铗立板缺乏，二月份下半月每天减用一台排梗机，因而减少了许多产量。再加上废品率的增加及排梗机有时停开，该厂在生产上所受的损失是很大的。我认为在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，还这样对待生产，是严重的错误。该厂行政领导干部应公开检讨错误，并迅速采取有效措施，改变这种情况。    王天祥
