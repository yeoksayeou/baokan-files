Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 17th: At the staff meeting on the fourth item of the Korean armistice negotiations on March 17th, our staff informed the other side of the incident of enemy aircraft strafing our Changsong No. 1 prisoner-of-war camp on March 16th and wounding one British prisoner, drawing their serious attention. Our notification is as follows:

"At 01:35 hours on March 16, 1952, one of your military aircraft attacked our No. 1 prisoner-of-war camp located in Changsong, strafing it with machine guns and conducting reconnaissance over the camp. The detailed circumstances and results of your aircraft's attack on the prisoner-of-war camp are currently under investigation. Preliminary reports indicate that one British prisoner of war was injured. Your attack on our No. 1 prisoner-of-war camp is another act of disregarding international conventions, violating humanitarianism, and breaking the agreements between the two sides, following your attack on our No. 8 prisoner-of-war camp in Jiangdong on January 14, 1952. The No. 1 prisoner-of-war camp is marked with clear signs agreed upon by both sides. You have no excuse to deny your responsibility for this incident. It must be seriously pointed out that you have continuously and wantonly massacred our captured personnel under your responsibility, while continuously bombing and strafing your captured personnel under our responsibility. For this continuous crime, you bear a serious responsibility to our side and the people of the world that cannot be concealed and cannot be evaded. Your continuous act of killing prisoners of both sides makes people doubt whether you have the sincerity to actively resolve the issue of prisoners of war for the welfare of the prisoners, including the welfare of your own captured personnel."

After the statement by our staff, it was further pointed out that, given the other side's past and present indiscriminate bombing and wanton massacres, only by the other side quickly abandoning delaying tactics, determining the principle of total repatriation, resolving the fourth item on the agenda, and achieving an armistice as soon as possible can such incidents be effectively prevented from happening again, and can the prisoners of war held by both sides no longer be constantly threatened and harmed by the other side's indiscriminate bombing and wanton massacres.

At the staff meeting on the third item of the agenda, the two sides discussed the specific locations of the designated rear ports. Our side suggested that our designated ports be Sinuiju, Hamhung, Chongjin, Manpo, and Sinanju. The designated ports in the military control area of the other side should be Busan, Incheon, Suwon, Yeosu, and Pohang. However, at the meeting on the 17th, the other side suggested expanding the scope of Hamhung among our designated ports to include Hungnam, changing Sinanju to Pyongyang, and including Chinnampo and the airport near Pyongyang. The other side also suggested changing the other side's rear ports to Seoul, including Incheon and the airport near Seoul, Gangneung including Yangyang, Gunsan, Daegu, and Busan including Masan. Our side pointed out that the other side's proposal is not in accordance with the clear agreement reached by both sides. Both sides have determined that the number of designated ports for each side is five, and both sides have agreed that the scope of each designated port is the urban area of this designated port, and each point of entry used for rotation and replacement belonging to this urban area, and the passages from the urban area to these points of entry. The other side's proposal expands the scope of the designated ports, exceeding the clear agreement between the two sides, and in fact violates the agreement on the number of five designated ports for each side. Our side believes that there is no need to revise our carefully considered suggestions regarding the specific locations of the designated ports. Our side proposes that the other side carefully reconsider our proposed locations for the ten designated ports for both sides.

    就美机扫射我方昌城第一号战俘营事件
    我方严斥美方连续杀害双方被俘人员罪行
    我对双方特定后方口岸具体地点提出合理建议
    【新华社开城十七日电】三月十七日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程参谋会议上，我方参谋就对方飞机在三月十六日扫射我方昌城第一号战俘营，并伤英俘一人事件通知对方，提起其严重注意。我方通知如下：
    “一九五二年三月十六日晨一时三十五分，你方军用飞机一架袭击我方位置在昌城的第一号战俘营，用机枪扫射后，并在该战俘营上空飞行侦察一次。你方飞机袭击该战俘营的详细情形和结果正在进行调查中。据初步报告，该战俘营内有英籍战俘一人受伤，你方这次袭击我方第一号战俘营，是你方在一九五二年一月十四日袭击江东我方第八号战俘营后的又一次无视国际惯例违背人道主义破坏双方协议的行为。该第一号战俘营标有双方所协议的明显的标志。你方没有任何藉口否认你方对这一事件的责任。必须严重指出：你方对在你方负责收容之下的我方被俘人员连续肆意屠杀，对在我方收容之下的你方被俘人员，则连续进行轰炸和扫射。对这种连续的罪行，你方对我方以及全世界人民负有无可掩饰也绝不能逃避的严重责任。你方这种连续的杀害双方被俘人员的行为，使人们怀疑你方究竟有无为了战俘们的福利，包含你方自己的被俘人员的福利在内，而积极解决战俘问题的诚意。”
    我方参谋在发言以后，更进一步指出：鉴于对方自过去到现在的狂轰滥炸和肆意屠杀，只有对方迅速放弃拖延战术，确定全部遣返原则，解决第四项议程，早日实现停战，才能有效地保障这类事件不再发生，才能使双方所收容的战俘不再受对方这种狂轰滥炸和肆意屠杀的不断威胁与危害。
    第三项议程参谋会议上，双方就特定后方口岸的具体地点进行了讨论，我方建议我方特定口岸为新义州、咸兴、清津、满浦与新安州。对方军事控制地区中的特定口岸为釜山、仁川、水原、丽水与浦项。但对方在十七日的会上，建议在我方特定口岸中扩大咸兴范围，而包括兴南，将新安州改为平壤，并包括镇南浦及平壤附近的机场。对方并建议将对方后方口岸改为汉城包括仁川及汉城附近机场，江陵包括襄阳、群山、大邱及釜山包括马山。我方指出：对方所提出的建议是与双方已达成的明确协议不相符合的，双方已确定每方的特定口岸数目为五个，双方并同意每一特定口岸的范围为这一特定口岸的市区，及属于这一市区的各用于轮换与替换的进口点，以及自市区到这些进口点的通道。对方的建议将特定口岸的范围扩大，超越了双方的明确协议，并在实际上违反了每方五个特定口岸的数目的协议。我方认为没有任何必要修正我方经过慎重考虑后所提出的关于特定口岸具体地点的建议。我方提议对方再次慎重考虑我方所提出的双方共十个特定口岸的地点。
