To the Editor: I participated in the Southwest Land Reform Work Group at the end of May last year and returned to Beijing at the end of September.

Our entire group consisted of more than 500 people. On the train, the food allowance was 20,000 yuan per person per day. If we were more frugal, 15,000 yuan per person per day would have been enough. Along the way, we passed through Wuhan, Chongqing, Nanchong, and other places, and the local authorities all provided us with lavish receptions. It was truly "a small banquet at every meal, and a large banquet every other day." After the meals, there were always evening parties. The county and district governments also did their utmost to provide hospitality. During the land reform period in the countryside, we all enjoyed the treatment of a middle or small kitchen, plus an "office expense" allowance. However, the local cadres who participated in the land reform were all given the treatment of a large kitchen. In order to take care of the central land reform workers, the government sometimes issued "special living subsidies." When the Western Sichuan group left Western Sichuan, the administrative office gave each person a famous Sichuan brocade quilt. When we returned, many people made large purchases of local Sichuan products. From Sichuan brocade and silk, Tuo tea, all the way to cool mats and bamboo baskets, etc. Some people said, "The central land reform group has become a central purchasing group," which had a very bad impact on the masses. Some members of the group borrowed money from the group headquarters for personal matters, and if they were slightly dissatisfied, they would say, "You're so stingy, you don't even take care of this." But in fact, everyone's original salary was still paid in full during the land reform work period.

I think the Southwest Land Reform Work Group should examine this phenomenon of extravagance and waste. I also suggest that similar work groups and visiting groups in the future should strive for simplicity in order to save the people's financial resources. The relevant responsible authorities in various localities should also strive for simplicity in their hospitality, in order to be in line with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy.

### 去年五月的西南土地改革工作团有严重铺张浪费现象

    去年五月的西南土地改革工作团有严重铺张浪费现象
    编辑同志：我去年五月底参加了西南土地改革工作团，九月底回北京。
    我们全团五百多人，在火车上，每人每天伙食费是二万元，假若节省些，每人每天一万五千元就足够了。沿途经过武汉、重庆、南充等地，各地有关当局，对我们都大事招待。真所谓“顿顿是小筵，隔日必大筵”。餐后必有晚会。县、区各级政府也是竭尽力量，从事招待。在乡下参加土地改革期间，我们一律享受中灶或小灶待遇，外加“办公费”。而当地参加土地改革的干部，却都是大灶待遇。政府为了照顾中央土地改革工作人员，有时并加发“特别生活补助费”。川西团离川西时，行署送给每人一条著名的川锦被子。当我们回来时，不少人大事采购四川土特产。从川锦、川绸、沱茶，一直买到凉席、竹篮等等。有人说：“中央土地改革团变成中央采购团”了，对群众的影响很不好。有的团员向团部借钱办私事，稍不遂心，就说：“真小气，这点都不照顾。”但事实上，每人在参加土地改革工作期间，都是原薪照发的。
    我觉得西南土地改革工作团应检查这种铺张浪费现象。我并建议：以后类似这样的工作团、访问团，都应当竭力简朴，以节省人民财力。各地有关负责当局，对于招待，也应该力从简单，才合乎增产节约的精神。
