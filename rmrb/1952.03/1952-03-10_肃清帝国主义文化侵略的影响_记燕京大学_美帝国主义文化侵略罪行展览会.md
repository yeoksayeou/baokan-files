    Eradicating the Influence of Imperialist Cultural Aggression
    ——A Record of the "Exhibition of Crimes of American Imperialist Cultural Aggression" at Yenching University

    (I)
    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement at Yenching University entered the stage of eradicating bourgeois ideology and the influence of American imperialist aggression in late February. This important stronghold of American imperialism's aggression against China will be thoroughly transformed in this movement and truly become one of the cultural fronts of the Chinese people.

    In the three years since liberation, although the American imperialists have been driven out of China, the remaining poison they left behind at Yenching University is deeply rooted. Many teachers still seriously retain corrupt bourgeois ideas, especially the idea of ​​worshipping the United States. Let's cite a few of the most prominent examples. At the first welcoming meeting after liberation, the person in charge of the university openly praised the American imperialists, saying that the Americans at Yenching University were "good people who are hard to find even with lanterns in the United States"! When Ke Anxi, the former director of the Western Language Department of the university, fled back to the United States during the Chinese people's movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the teachers and students of the Western Language Department held a grand farewell party for her and presented her with a silk banner with the words "Spring breeze transforming rain, benefiting me greatly." In February 1951, the university was taken over as a public university, but for the past year, the content of most courses has remained the same as in the past. The Department of Political Science even recently purchased a large number of reactionary reference books, including the works of war mongers Dulles, Churchill, and Jessup, the executor of the American Far East aggression policy. Some people in the Psychology Department continue to teach lectures that openly slander the working people, saying that the wisdom of 35-year-old working people is only equivalent to that of a seven-year-old bourgeois child. The Western Language Department still teaches absurd detective novels in class, and the extracurricular reading is still extremely lewd pornography. As for teachers frequently spreading bourgeois individualistic ideas of fame and gain and pro-American remarks in and out of class, this is a very common phenomenon.

    In order to cooperate with the movement and thoroughly eliminate these ideological poisons, the Yenching University Thrift Inspection Committee held an "Exhibition of Crimes of American Imperialist Cultural Aggression" at the beginning of this month. The exhibition proved with many irrefutable materials that this school, founded by American imperialist churches, was not only a center for spreading bourgeois ideology, but also a front for American imperialist aggression against China. The exposure of these facts shattered the illusions that many people had held about Yenching for more than 30 years.

    Why did American imperialism establish Yenching University? Austin once said: This was "for the friendship of the Chinese people." Is this really the case? Let’s take a look at a booklet published in 1922 when Yenching was raising funds in the United States. This booklet says: The reason why the United States wants to run this school is because "today's Chinese students are the future leaders of Chinese thought and life," and China's future has a "direct impact" on America's future. The page printed with this passage is now on display in the exhibition.

    The students of Yenching University used to speak English fluently and were "very foreign," which was famous throughout the country. Why did the American imperialists emphasize English teaching so much? The exhibition displays a "Suggestion on the Organization and Guidance of English Teaching in China" drafted by Ke Anxi, the former director of the Western Language Department of the university. Ke Anxi said: "In order to expand American interests in China, one of the most important things is to fully develop English teaching." She said: Due to the language barrier, there is a "danger of losing sympathy for the United States" in China.

    Isn't it obvious that the purpose of the American imperialists was to cultivate forces and influence to invade and enslave China through Yenching?

    (II)

    In this regard, the American imperialists did achieve their goals to a certain extent. The exhibition displays many statistical charts on the situation of graduates. From 1932 to 1947, the Institute of Social Sciences graduated a total of 19 people. None of them participated in the revolution. Except for one person who became a housewife, the others worked for the Kuomintang bandit gang or the Americans. From 1933 to 1947, the Department of Chemistry graduated a total of 93 people, of whom 17 were in the United States, 11 were in Taiwan, 2 were in Hong Kong, and 1 was in Indonesia. From 1928 to 1948, the Department of Journalism graduated 103 people, of whom 101 worked for the reactionaries. The heads of the branch offices of the Chiang bandit gang's Central News Agency in the United States, Britain, Japan, the Philippines, and Australia were all graduates of Yenching University. Some are still working as war correspondents for the American army invading Korea!

    Stuart himself knew how to value this "achievement" of his. This imperialist element, the founder of Yenching University and once the executor of the policy of aggression against China, said in a report when referring to the students of Yenching University: "These alert, capable, and reliable young men and women of ours have infiltrated into all aspects of Chinese society, and they are constantly spreading the influence and spirit they received from the school." This report is now also on display in the exhibition.

    What kind of "influence and spirit" did the American imperialists want to "spread"? Dozens of graduation theses displayed in the exhibition answered this question. Some of these theses rehashed the anti-Soviet and anti-communist rhetoric that the American imperialists had always clamored for, some praised American imperialism from various angles, and some elaborated on various bourgeois "theories." A graduation thesis from the Psychology Department used various methods to prove that foreigners were smarter than Chinese, and the bourgeoisie were smarter than the working people. This thesis said: "The children of professors are smarter than the children of Chengfu Village (note: the village near Yenching University) because they receive the same education as foreign children. Poor people's children are dumber than rich people's children." Another graduation thesis explains how to use various methods to evaluate the beauty of a person's face, and another one is specially "researching" the clothing of Yenching women. A graduation thesis from the Department of Journalism entitled "On the American Press" not only praised the American newspapers to the extreme, but also particularly emphasized that American newspapers have "freedom of speech." An economics thesis on "China Famine Relief" praised the "merits" of the imperialists to the Chinese people. Another thesis on "China's Population and Land" argues that "the civil war was caused by overpopulation," so his conclusion is: "Civil war is beneficial to the overpopulation and poverty of the people."

    There is no need to quote such nonsense anymore. For more than 30 years, these students of Yenching have spread this kind of "influence and spirit" everywhere. Can the damage to the Chinese people be calculated with numbers?

    (III)

    Not only that, Yenching University itself was also an intelligence agency used by American imperialism to cleverly carry out intelligence work. From 1939, the Department of Economics used a special fund from the United States to engage in economic intelligence work. They published a "report" every month and sent it to the United States. In addition to the living index of workers in North China, there were also price indexes for many important commodities. In 1950, after liberation, the American "United Board for Christian Colleges in China" even wrote a letter to "praise" Zheng Linzhuang, the director of the Department of Economics who presided over this work. The letter said: "The information on the cost of living, the annual figures from 1939 to the present, has been of great help to us." From 1928, Yenching University received a sum of money from the American monopoly capitalist Rockefeller, which was used to engage in various investigation and research work, and the results were sent to the United States. From these investigation reports that have been sent, we can see how painstakingly American imperialism was collecting information about China through Yenching. These investigation reports include "The Economic Plans and Policies of the Chinese Government since 1929," "Overview of the Cotton Yarn Market in Hebei Province," "The Oil Extraction Industry in Hebei Province," "Overview of the Grain Market in Hebei Province," and "Observation Report on Rural Social Life in North China." Copies of these investigations and reports are now on display at the exhibition. In addition, the Americans at the school often wrote reports to the United States. The women's department of the school had a system of reporting to the Yenching office in New York every two weeks. The exhibition displays many of these reports that were inspected during this movement. The content of these reports includes not only the situation of the students, but also the political situation in China. The big American imperialist spy Stuart once said: "I am a foreigner and completely ignorant of politics." In fact, he had already worked as an intelligence agent in 1925. The exhibition displays a draft of a report he gave to the "Board of Trustees" at that time, marked "confidential," which said: "A revolutionary movement instigated by Russian secret agencies is rapidly forming, and red forces are showing their heads. Some people in the National Peking University and other intellectuals in this city believe that peaceful reform is hopeless and must be done by force." During the Japanese occupation of North China, this spy also served as a messenger between the American and Chiang bandit gangs and the Japanese invaders. The exhibition displays a personal note of his. Let’s take a look at his confession: "(I) go to the wartime capital once a year. ... Before each trip, I frankly tell them (referring to the Japanese invaders) that when I come back, if they want to ask, I will also convey my impressions to them. At that time, there was a faction in Japan who opposed the war against China and advocated a truce on reasonable terms before getting deeper. ... During these years, the pro-peace faction repeatedly sent people to discuss with me and Fu Jingbo how to negotiate peace with Chiang Kai-shek - undoubtedly, the warlords also knew this. I told Chiang this news, and Chiang also unofficially authorized me to state his conditions." This is how Stuart used the school as a base to do things that sold out the interests of the Chinese people.

    (IV)

    For American imperialism: the past Yenching University was indeed an important fortress for invading China. Xia Rende, the former director of the Department of Education of the school and an imperialist element, once pretended to be progressive and was known as a so-called "red professor." After being expelled by the Chinese people, he wrote an article in the reactionary "Time" magazine, which said: "It is better to run a few more Yenching Universities than to run the Voice of America." This is by no means a deliberate exaggeration. From this, it is not difficult to understand that it was no accident that American imperialism tried to maintain this base of aggression before and after the liberation of Beijing. On the eve of liberation, the American imperialist "Board of Trustees" held a series of emergency meetings to discuss countermeasures, and at the same time sent a series of instructions to Yenching University. They wanted Yenching University to "never compromise in principle" when encountering "communist ideological erosion." They could only "compromise" on "procedures." In 1950, when the American "Board of Trustees" summed up a year of conspiratorial activities after the liberation of Yenching, although they expressed sadness over the fact that the Chinese people would inevitably fundamentally reform the curriculum, they still fantasized about changing the soup but not the medicine. The "Board of Trustees" document displayed in the exhibition says: "Fortunately, the teachers are still trained in the United States, and many of them are Christians."

    But this illusion of the imperialists can no longer be realized. This movement has alerted the teachers of Yenching, and most teachers have deeply reviewed their serious bourgeois ideology and pro-American ideas. This exhibition has more deeply exposed the crimes of American imperialism in using Yenching to invade China, and also exposed the hideous faces of all the Americans who were in Yenching in the past. These iron facts have greatly aroused the anger of the teachers, students, staff and alumni of Yenching. Many people wrote words like this in the opinion book of the exhibition: "The exhibition educated me. I have been a tool of American imperialism for a long time without knowing it." Some expressed that they must carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to the end, thoroughly eliminate the influence of American imperialism, and truly transform Yenching into an educational front for the Chinese people.

    肃清帝国主义文化侵略的影响
    ——记燕京大学“美帝国主义文化侵略罪行展览会”
    新华社记者  沈容
    （一）
    燕京大学反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动在二月下旬进入了肃清资产阶级思想和美帝国主义侵略影响的阶段。美帝国主义侵略中国的这个重要堡垒将在这次运动中得到彻底的改造，真正成为中国人民的文化阵地之一。
    解放三年来，虽然美帝国主义者已被赶出中国，但是他们遗留在燕京大学的余毒却是根深柢固的，很多教师们仍然严重地保留着资产阶级的腐朽思想，特别是崇拜美国的思想。举几个最突出的例子吧。该校负责人在解放后的第一次迎新会上还在公开歌颂美帝国主义者，说燕京大学的美国人是“打着灯笼在美国也难找到的好人”！该校前西语系主任柯安喜在中国人民抗美援朝运动中逃回美国的时候，西语系的师生竟大开其欢送会，并且送给她一面锦旗，上面写着“春风化雨，惠我孔多”。一九五一年二月，该校被接管为公立大学，但是一年以来，大部分课程的内容仍然原封不动地保存着过去的一套。政治系甚至在不久以前还购买了一大批反动的参考书籍，其中包括大战争贩子杜勒斯、邱吉尔以及美国远东侵略政策执行人耶塞普等人的作品。心理系还有人继续讲授着过去公开污蔑劳动人民的讲义，比如说三十五岁的劳动人民的智慧仅能相当于资产阶级的七岁小孩之类。西语系在课堂上讲的仍旧是荒谬绝伦的侦探小说，课外阅读的依然是下流已极的色情读物。至于教师们在课内和课外经常散布资产阶级个人主义的名利思想和崇美言论，更是十分普遍的现象。
    为了配合运动的进行，彻底肃清这些思想上的污毒，燕京大学节约检查委员会在本月初举办了一个“美帝国主义文化侵略罪行展览会”。展览会以许多无可辩驳的材料证明：美帝国主义教会创办的这个学校，不仅是散布资产阶级思想的中心，而且是美帝国主义侵略中国的阵地。这些事实的揭发，把许多人三十多年来对燕京的错觉粉碎了。
    美帝国主义为什么要办燕京大学呢？奥斯汀曾经说：这是“为了对中国人民的友谊”。真是这样吗？让我们看看一九二二年燕京在美国募集基金时出版的一本小册子吧。这小册子里面说：美国所以要办这个学校，是因为“今天的中国学生就是未来中国思想上和生活上的领导者”，而中国的将来，对美国的将来有着“直接的影响”。印有这段话的这一页，现在陈列在展览会里。
    燕京大学的学生们过去满口英语，“洋气十足”，这在全国是有名的。为什么美帝国主义者这样着重英语的教学呢？展览会里陈列着该校前西语系主任柯安喜所草拟的一份“关于在华英语教学的组织与指导的建议”。柯安喜说：“为了扩张美国在华利益，最重要的事情之一是充分展开英文教学。”她说：由于语言的隔阂，在中国有“失去对美国同情的危险”。
    美帝国主义者的目的，就是要通过燕京来培养侵略和奴役中国的势力和影响，这难道还不明显吗？
    （二）
    在这一方面，美帝国主义者确实在一定程度上达到了目的。展览会上陈列了许多关于毕业生情况的统计图表。社会系研究院从一九三二年到一九四七年这十五年中共毕业十九人，没有一个人参加革命，其中除了一人当家庭妇女外，其他的都是为国民党匪帮或美国人工作。化学系从一九三三年到一九四七年这十四年中共毕业九十三人，其中在美国的就有十七人，在台湾的有十一人，在香港的有两人，在印尼的有一人。新闻系自一九二八年到一九四八年这二十年中毕业一百零三人，其中有一百零一人为反动派工作。蒋匪帮中央社驻美、英、日、菲、澳等地的分社负责人，都是燕京大学的毕业生。有的人至今还在做侵朝美军的随军记者！
    司徒雷登本人是很懂得重视他的这种“成绩”的。这个燕京大学的创办者，一度为侵华政策的执行人的帝国主义分子在一个报告中提到燕京大学的学生时说：“我们这些警觉的、能干的和可靠的青年男女学生已经渗入到中国社会的各方面，他们不断把从学校里受到的影响和精神传播出去。”这个报告现在也陈列在展览会里。
    美帝国主义者所要“传播”的究竟是什么样的“影响和精神”呢？展览会里陈列的几十本毕业学生的论文解答了这个问题。这些论文中有一部分是重弹美帝国主义者所一贯叫嚣的反苏反共的论调的，一部分是从各种角度来歌颂美帝国主义的，还有一部分是阐发各种各样的资产阶级“理论”的。心理系一个毕业学生的论文用各种方法证明外国人的智慧比中国人高，资产阶级的智慧比劳动人民的智慧高。这篇论文说：“教授们的孩子比成府村（按：燕京大学附近的村子）的孩子智慧高一等，因为他们所受的教育和外国孩子所受的教育一样。穷人的孩子比有钱人家的孩子笨。”还有一个毕业学生的论文是说明怎样用各种方法来评定一个人的脸部美，另外一篇是专门“研究”燕京妇女的服装的。新闻系的一篇题为“论美国的报业”的毕业论文中，除了对美国的报纸极尽吹嘘的能事之外，又特别着重说明美国的报纸有“言论自由”。经济系有一篇论文论“华洋义赈”，歌颂帝国主义者对中国人民的“功德”。另一篇论“中国的人口与土地”，作者认为“内战是由于人口过多形成的”，因此他的结论是：“内战对人口过剩及人民的贫穷反而有益。”
    诸如此类的胡说，用不着再摘引了。三十多年来，燕京的这些学生到处传播着这种“影响和精神”，对中国人民的损害，难道是可以用数字来计算的吗？
    （三）
    不仅如此，燕京大学本身又是美帝国主义巧妙地运用它来进行情报工作的一个情报机关。经济系从一九三九年开始，就用美国的一笔专款，从事经济情报工作。他们每月出版“报告”寄到美国去。内容除了华北工人的生活指数外，还有许多种重要商品的物价指数。在解放以后的一九五○年，美国的
    “在华基督教学校联合托事部”还写信“表扬”主持这一工作的经济系系主任郑林庄。这封信说： “关于生活指数的情报，从一九三九年到目前的每年的数字，对我们有莫大的帮助。”从一九二八年起，燕京大学就得到美国垄断资本家洛克菲勒的一笔钱，用来从事各种调查研究工作，把结果寄往美国。从已寄去的这些调查报告中，我们可以看到，美帝国主义是在怎样处心积虑地通过燕京来收集有关中国的情报。这些调查报告中有“中国政府自一九二九年以来的经济计划和政策”、“河北省的棉纱市集概况”、“河北省的榨油工业”、“河北省的粮食市集概况”、“华北农村社会生活的观察报告”。这些调查和报告的副本，现在都陈列在展览会上。此外，该校的美国人还经常向美国写汇报。该校女部就有一个制度，每隔两星期向美国纽约的燕京办事处汇报一次。展览会里陈列了许多在这次运动中检查出来的这种汇报。这些汇报的内容除了学生的情况外，还有中国的政治形势。美帝国主义的大特务分子司徒雷登曾经说：“我是一个外国人，对政治完全外行。”事实上，他早在一九二五年就担任了谍报员的工作。展览会上陈列了那时他给“托事部”的一件标明“密件”的汇报底稿，其中说：“一个为俄国特务机关所鼓动的革命运动正在迅速地形成，赤色势力正在显露头角，在国立北大及本城其他知识分子中，有些人相信和平改革是无望的，非得蛮干一番。”日寇占领华北期间，这个谍报员又担任了美蒋匪帮和日寇之间的信使。展览会里陈列着他的一篇私人杂记。让我们看看他的自供：“（我）一年一度到战时首都去。……我每去之前，就坦白地告诉他们（指日寇），回来时，若他们要问，我也把我的印象传达给他们。那时日本已有一派人反对对华战争，主张在陷入更深以前，就在合理的条件下停战。……在这些年内，主和派曾多次派人和我与傅泾波商量怎样跟蒋介石讲和——无疑的，军阀们也知道这一点。我把这消息告诉蒋，蒋也非正式地授权给我述说他的条件。”司徒雷登就是这样以学校为依托，做着出卖中国人民利益的勾当。
    （四）
    对于美帝国主义来说：过去的燕京大学，确实是侵略中国的一个重要的堡垒。该校前教育系主任帝国主义分子夏仁德曾经伪装进步，有所谓“红色教授”之称。他在被中国人民驱逐回去之后，曾在反动的“时代”杂志上写了一篇文章，其中说：“办美国之音不如多办几个燕京大学。”这绝不是故作惊人之谈。由此也不难了解，美帝国主义在北京解放前后力图保持这个侵略的据点绝不是偶然的事。在解放前夕，美帝国主义的“托事部”曾召开过一系列的紧急会议，商讨对策，同时给燕京大学发来了一连串的指示。他们要燕京大学在遇到“共产主义思想侵蚀”的时候，“无论如何原则上不能妥协”。只能在“手续上”“妥协一下”。一九五○年，美国“托事部”在总结燕京解放后一年的阴谋活动时，虽然对中国人民必然要根本改革课程内容这一点表示悲哀，但是仍然幻想着换汤不换药。展览会陈列的“托事部”的这个文件上说：“所幸者，教师们仍是美国训练出来的，他们之中有许多是基督教徒。”
    但是帝国主义者的这一幻想，再也不能实现了。这次运动已经使燕京的教师们警惕起来，大多数教师沉痛地检讨了严重的资产阶级思想和崇拜美国的思想。这次展览会更深刻地揭露了美帝国主义利用燕京侵略中国的罪行，同时也揭露了过去所有在燕京的美国人的狰狞面目。这些铁的事实，更大大激起了燕京师生员工和校友们的愤怒。许多人在展览会的意见簿上写着这一类的话：“展览会教育了我，我长期做了美帝国主义的工具还不自知。”有的表示一定要把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动进行到底，彻底肃清美帝国主义的影响，把燕京真正改造成中国人民的教育阵地。
