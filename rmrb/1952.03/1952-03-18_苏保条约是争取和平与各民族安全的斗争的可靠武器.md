    Today marks the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Bulgaria.

    This historically significant treaty reflects the great principles of Stalin's foreign policy: mutual respect, independence, and national autonomy. The Soviet-Bulgarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance is in the vital interests of the people of both countries, aims to consolidate world peace, and is in the interests of all peace-loving nations engaged in the struggle for peace and security and against the warmongers of a new war.

    The Soviet Union's victory over Hitlerite Germany and the liberation of the Bulgarian people from fascist enslavement by the Soviet army are the most important prerequisites for the consolidation and development of the Soviet-Bulgarian treaty and the friendship between the two peoples.

    The friendship between the Bulgarian people and the great Russian people has deep historical roots. The Bulgarian people will never forget that the great Russian people liberated them from Turkish yoke and have always been their loyal friends.

    The immortal leader of the Bulgarian people, Dimitrov, defined the significance of this treaty as follows: "After the signing of this treaty, our people and our People's Republic have not only become friends and faithful comrades of the Soviet Union, but also have become loyal and reliable allies of the Soviet Union in the interests of the two peoples and international peace."

    Now that the American and British imperialists are openly pursuing a policy of reviving militarism and fascism in West Germany, and are building a vengeful West German army to prepare for a war of aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the Soviet-Bulgarian treaty has special significance. The Soviet-Bulgarian treaty is fully in line with the principles of upholding peace and international security. The treaty stipulates that both parties are responsible for taking all measures to eliminate any threat of aggression from Germany or any other country (directly or otherwise associated with Germany).

    This treaty fully reflects the desire of both parties to participate in various international activities aimed at ensuring the peace and security of all nations in a spirit of sincere cooperation.

    The four years since the signing of the treaty have demonstrated the great and good strength of Soviet-Bulgarian friendship and mutual cooperation.

    Under the leadership of the glorious Bulgarian Communist Party and the leader of the Bulgarian people, Chervenkov, the Bulgarian working people, using and relying on the rich experience of the Soviet people in building socialism and the comprehensive and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, are successfully implementing the five-year plan for developing the national economy and the plan for building the foundations of socialism, transforming Bulgaria from a backward agricultural country into an advanced country with developed industry and agriculture.

    In 1951 alone, the products of our state-owned industrial enterprises expanded by 19 percent, electricity production increased by almost 30 percent, mineral and coal production greatly increased, the production of tractors and threshing machines expanded, and great achievements were made in railway and road transportation. Could our people have achieved these accomplishments without the direct assistance of the Soviet Union?

    Thanks to the assistance of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin himself—the best friend and protector of the Bulgarian people—the working class of our country was able to complete the construction of the Stalin Chemical Plant in Dimitrovgrad, the Chervenkov Thermal Power Plant, and the Chervenkov Tank Factory in 1951, expand the Stalin and Dimitrov Thermal Power Stations, excavate artificial irrigation canals in the fields along the Danube River, and build the Kolarov Reservoir and many other projects.

    In 1952, the Bulgarian people will likewise rely on the direct assistance of the Soviet Union to complete the construction of mineral processing plants and textile factories, expand the Dimitrovgrad Cement Factory, and build many other factories of various sizes.

    The assistance provided by the great Soviet Union to the People's Republic of Bulgaria has given Bulgaria the possibility of building socialist industry, and has thus laid the foundation for agriculture to move towards the path of socialism.

    The Soviet Union's fraternal assistance in the mechanization of agriculture and increasing production in Bulgaria is also significant. In the fields of Bulgaria, there are 4,026 Soviet tractors, 1,300 horse-drawn harvesters, 550 Soviet combine harvesters, and 110 mobile repair shops. This has led to an increase in the number of machine tractor stations from 95 in 1950 to 140 in 1951 and 1952. In addition, Bulgaria's agricultural production has also received Soviet chemical fertilizers, seeds, and other assistance. All of this has accelerated the reconstruction of our agriculture. The number of agricultural labor cooperatives reached 2,740 in 1951, an increase of 8 percent over 1950; the cultivated area of agricultural cooperatives expanded to 120,000 hectares, and the number of families joining agricultural cooperatives increased by 16 percent over 1950.

    All of this is creating greater and greater possibilities for improving the well-being of the Bulgarian working people year by year. For example, the national income in 1951 expanded by 30 percent compared to 1950, and the number of workers and staff also increased significantly, while their average wage increased by 7.3 percent in 1951.

    While consolidating the domestic economy and improving the well-being of the Bulgarian people, under the strong influence of the world's most advanced Soviet socialist culture, the culture of people's Bulgaria has also flourished. In all aspects of the Bulgarian people's lives, the strong and good influence of the great Soviet Union can be felt.

    Comrade Chervenkov, in pointing out the great achievements of the People's Republic of Bulgaria in building the foundations of socialism, emphasized: "These achievements are determined by the powerful and selfless support of the Soviet Union—our great liberator and protector." It is primarily due to the reliance of the Bulgarian people on the friendship of the Soviet Union that it has been possible to achieve success in the cause of national industrialization, agricultural and cultural life, and to achieve victory in the cause of consolidating the survival and independence of the new state.

    Under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the great achievements of the Bulgarian people in building socialism have aroused crazy hatred in the imperialist camp of new war instigators. The imperialists use their servants—the Tito-Rankovic vile traitor gang—as their shock force, adopting the most despicable and cunning means to oppose the free Bulgarian people. They spare no expense of millions of dollars to engage in espionage and sabotage activities, attempting to turn Bulgaria back into their base for bloody adventures in the Balkans and to enslave the Bulgarian people again.

    The Bulgarian people, united around their Communist Party and the People's Government headed by Comrade Chervenkov, resolutely and bravely smashed all the conspiracies of the imperialist spies and vigilantly defended the freedom and independence won with the blood of the outstanding sons of the Bulgarian and Soviet peoples.

    The Bulgarian people, who are enthusiastically building their beautiful socialist future, have a vital interest in defending the cause of lasting peace, and therefore they are filled with love and loyalty to the great Soviet Union and the powerful camp of peace and democracy. They, shoulder to shoulder with the great Chinese people and fully in accordance with the principles of the Soviet-Bulgarian treaty, firmly and unyieldingly guard peace.

    The Bulgarian people today solemnly celebrate the fourth anniversary of the Soviet-Bulgarian treaty, expressing their sincere gratitude to the Soviet Union—the Soviet Union will forever be the source of the Bulgarian people's strength, courage, and inspiration. The Bulgarian people vow to do everything in their power to consolidate, expand, and deepen Soviet-Bulgarian friendship.

    The Soviet-Bulgarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance is a reliable weapon in the struggle for peace and security in the Balkans and Europe, a reliable guarantee of the independence and national sovereignty of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and a guarantee of Bulgaria's achievements in the struggle for peace and socialism.

    Long live the Soviet-Bulgarian treaty! (Translated by Junqiang)

    苏保条约是争取和平与各民族安全的斗争的可靠武器
    保加利亚驻华大使　彼得科夫
    今天是伟大的苏联和保加利亚人民共和国签订友好、合作和互助条约的四周年纪念日。
    在这个富有历史意义的条约中，反映出斯大林的对外政策的伟大原则：互相尊敬、独立和民族自主。苏保友好、合作和互助条约是符合于两国人民的切身利益的，它以巩固世界和平为目的，并且符合于那些从事争取和平与安全、为反对新战争贩子而进行斗争的全体爱好和平的民族的利益。
    苏联的战胜希特勒德国与苏军从法西斯奴役下解放保加利亚人民，是苏保条约和两国人民友谊的巩固和发展的最重要的先决条件。
    保加利亚人民和伟大的俄罗斯人民之间的友谊，有着深远的历史根源。保加利亚人民永不会忘记，伟大的俄罗斯人民由土耳其桎梏下解放了他们并一贯是他们的忠诚的朋友。
    保加利亚人民不朽的领袖季米特洛夫曾这样确定这项条约的意义：“在签订了这项条约之后，我国人民和我们人民共和国不仅是苏联的朋友和忠实的同志，在为了两国人民和国际和平的利益方面，已经成为苏联的忠诚可靠的同盟者了。”
    现在当美英帝国主义者公开在西德进行复活军国主义和法西斯主义的政策，并建立复仇的西德军队以准备反对苏联及人民民主国家的侵略战争时，苏保条约具有特殊的意义。苏保条约是完全符合于拥护和平和国际安全的原则的。条约规定，双方有责共同采取一切措施以消除来自德国方面或某一其他国家（直接的或以其他方式与德国联合起来的）方面的任何侵略威胁。
    在这项条约中，充分反映出双方以真诚合作的精神参加各种旨在保障各族人民的和平与安全的国际活动的愿望。
    条约签订后的四年时间，已经表示出苏保友谊和互相合作的伟大的良好力量。
    保加利亚劳动人民在光荣的保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民的领袖契尔文科夫的领导下，运用和依靠着苏联人民建设社会主义的丰富经验和苏联的全面而无私的帮助，顺利地实现着发展国民经济的五年计划和建设社会主义基础的计划，使保加利亚由一个落后的农业国变成工、农业发达的先进国家。
    仅在一九五一年一年之中，我国国营工业企业的产品扩大了百分之十九，电力生产几乎增加百分之三十，大大提高了矿产和煤的产量，扩充了拖拉机和打谷机的产量，在铁路和公路运输方面都达到了巨大成就。如果没有苏联的直接帮助，我国人民难道能获得这些成就吗？
    感谢苏联和斯大林同志本人——保加利亚人民最好的朋友和庇护者——的帮助，我国的工人阶级在一九五一年之中，能够完成了如季米特洛夫格勒的斯大林化学工厂、契尔文科夫火力发电所和契尔文科夫汽罐工厂的建筑工作，扩大了斯大林和季米特洛夫火力发电站，在多瑙河沿岸的田地上开掘了人工灌溉水渠，建筑了科拉罗夫人工水库和许多其他工程。
    在一九五二年，保加利亚人民将同样依靠着苏联的直接帮助，完成选矿工厂和纤维工厂的建筑工程，扩充季米特洛夫格勒的水泥工厂并建筑许多其他大小工厂。
    伟大的苏联给予保加利亚人民共和国的帮助，赋予了保加利亚建设社会主义工业的可能性，并从而奠定了农业步向社会主义道路的基础。
    苏联在保加利亚的农业机械化及提高产量方面的兄弟般的援助，也是很大的。在保加利亚的田地上，有四千零二十六部苏联的拖拉机，一千三百部马拉收割机，五百五十部苏联联合收割机和一百一十个流动修理所。这促使一九五一年至一九五二年的机器拖拉机站的数目达到一百四十所（一九五○年是九十五所）。此外，保加利亚的农业生产还获得苏联的化学肥料和种子及其他帮助。这一切都加速了我国农业的重建工作。农业劳动合作社的数目，一九五一年已达到二千七百四十个，即较一九五○年增加了百分之八；农业合作社的耕地面积扩大到十二万公顷，加入农业合作社的家庭，较一九五○年增加了百分之十六。
    这一切都逐年地为提高保加利亚劳动人民的幸福创造着愈来愈大的可能性。例如，一九五一年的国民收入较一九五○年扩大了百分之三十，工人和职员的数量也大量增加了，而他们的平均工资在一九五一年增加了百分之七点三。
    与巩固国内经济和改善保加利亚人民的幸福同时，在世界最先进的苏联社会主义文化的有力影响下，人民的保加利亚的文化也繁荣起来。在保加利亚人民生活的各方面，都可感到伟大的苏联的强有力的良好影响。
    契尔文科夫同志在指出保加利亚人民共和国在建设社会主义基础事业中的巨大成就时，曾强调说：“这些成就决定于苏联——我们伟大的解放者和保护者的有力而大公无私的支持的结果”。使国家工业化、农业和文化生活事业获得成绩、使巩固新的国家的生存和独立的事业取得胜利的成为可能，首先是由于保加利亚人民依靠了苏联的友谊。
    在保加利亚共产党领导下，保加利亚人民从事建设社会主义的巨大成就，在新战争贩子的帝国主义阵营中，引起了疯狂的仇恨。帝国主义者利用自己的仆役——铁托、兰科维奇卑鄙的叛徒匪帮作为自己的突击力量，采取最卑鄙狡猾的手段来反对自由的保加利亚人民。他们不惜花费数百万美元来从事间谍和破坏活动，妄图重新把保加利亚变成他们在巴尔干进行血腥冒险的基地，重新奴役保加利亚的人民。
    保加利亚人民，团结在自己的共产党和以契尔文科夫同志为首的人民政府的周围，坚决而勇敢地粉碎了帝国主义奸细的一切诡计，并警觉地保卫着以保加利亚和苏联人民优秀的儿子的血所争取来的自由和独立。
    正在热情地建设着自己美好的社会主义前途的保加利亚人民，对于保卫持久和平事业，有着切身的利害关系，因此他们对伟大的苏联和强大的和平民主阵营满怀热爱和忠诚。他们，与伟大的中国人民肩并肩地并且完全符合于苏保条约的原则，坚强地不屈不挠地守卫着和平。
    保加利亚人民今天隆重地庆祝苏保条约的四周年纪念，他们对苏联表示了自己的真诚感谢——苏联永远是保加利亚人民的力量、勇敢和鼓舞的泉源。保加利亚人民宣誓要尽一切力量来巩固、扩大和加深苏保友谊。
    苏保友好、合作和互助条约，在巴尔干和欧洲的争取和平和安全的斗争中，是一个可靠的武器，是保加利亚人民共和国的独立和民族主权的可靠保证，是保加利亚在争取和平与社会主义斗争中的成就的保证。
    苏保条约万岁！　　　　（君强译）
