    Suggestion to Promote the Beijing "Mayor's Representative Work Group" Method
    Editor: After reading the news about the Beijing "Mayor's Representative Work Group" in the People's Daily on February 15th, I fully felt the correctness and greatness of the Communist Party. Only the people's government under the leadership of the Communist Party can attach such importance to the people's opinions and thoroughly promote democracy. I believe this is one of the best ways to closely connect the people with the people's government, and it is also one of the best ways to listen to the opinions of the masses and inspect the work of our grassroots political power. This method will not only play a huge role in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, but it will also inevitably play a huge role in the movement to implement other policies. I suggest that local people's governments also do this and establish the "Mayor's Representative Work Group" method as a regular system.

    建议推广北京市“市长代表工作组”的方法
    编辑同志：从二月十五日人民日报上看到关于北京市“市长代表工作组”的消息后，我充分感觉到共产党的正确和伟大。只有共产党领导下的人民政府，才能这样重视人民的意见，才能这样彻底发扬民主。我认为这是密切人民与人民政府联系的最好方法之一，也是听取群众意见和检查我们基层政权工作的最好方法之一。这个方法，不只在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中可以起巨大的作用，在贯彻其他政策的运动中，也必然会起巨大的作用。我建议各地人民政府也这样做，并把“市长代表工作组”的方法，订成一个经常制度。
