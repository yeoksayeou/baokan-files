    Exposing the Crimes of Unscrupulous Merchants Who Plunder Peasants and Endanger Production
    Unscrupulous Merchants in Harbin and Changchun Cities
    Sabotage the Promotion of New Farm Tools
    To meet the needs of developing agricultural production, the Northeast People's Government commissioned more than 60 private iron factories in Harbin and Changchun in 1950 to produce a large number of new-style farm tools. These private iron factories took the opportunity to collude and raise prices. For example, the capitalist of the Fuxing Iron Factory in Harbin, after learning that the state was going to order new-style farm tools, immediately colluded with 36 private iron factories in the city to increase the cost of the "Lianhe Hao" cultivator by 25%, setting the price at 3.06 million yuan (Northeast currency, same below) per unit. Similarly, when 12 private iron factories in Changchun undertook to manufacture 1,000 chaff cutters, they raised the price to 4.2 million yuan per unit, while the actual cost was only 2.5 million yuan per unit. These illegal capitalists not only raised prices but also violated contracts and arbitrarily modified designs to cut corners. For example, the Fusheng, Hengda and other iron factories in Harbin changed the design of farm tools three times. The weeding blade of the cultivator was supposed to be made of one-and-a-half-fen thick iron plate, but they used only one-fen thick iron plate, resulting in an angle that did not meet the specifications and could not remove weeds. Two-thirds of the 160 chaff cutters manufactured by the Yida Iron Factory in Changchun had sand holes, which the factory filled with oil clay. In order to deliver this batch of substandard farm tools to the state, the illegal capitalists used various despicable means to bribe the acceptance personnel of the People's Government. For example, the illegal capitalists of the Fuxing Iron Factory in Harbin collectively bribed Wang Jiabao, the cadre sent by the Agricultural Department of the Northeast People's Government for acceptance. After accepting the bribe, Wang not only accepted most of the substandard products but also deceived the Songjiang Provincial People's Government Agricultural and Forestry Department by saying that the Fuxing Iron Factory delivered goods quickly and with good quality. As a result, this unscrupulous merchant was given a 10 million yuan reward and a banner of honor.
    Because most of the new-style farm tools manufactured by these illegal capitalists were substandard, the promotion of new-style farm tools was affected. For example, the Fuxing No. 1 weeder manufactured by the Fuxing Iron Factory had a large and steep plow body and a short plow tip. The tilled land had no loose soil, which was very unfavorable to drought and flood resistance. Farmers called it "scraping the land poor." The high-work weeding and cultivating plow manufactured by private iron factories in Changchun was also difficult to use. Farmers called it the "loss-making plow." Now the People's Government has gradually recovered this batch of poor-quality farm tools, and the state has suffered losses of more than 30 billion yuan.
    Unscrupulous Merchants in Xi'an Cut Corners When Manufacturing Waterwheels,
    Endangering the Drought Resistance Campaign
    In 1951, unscrupulous machinery merchants in Xi'an, Han Zhaokui, Lin Xianting, etc., cut corners and produced shoddy waterwheels for farmers, reaping illegal profits of more than 1.7 billion yuan. Due to the substandard waterwheels, farmers suffered incalculable losses in drought prevention work.
    Last year, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau planned to lend more than 12,000 waterwheels to farmers and commissioned more than 80 iron factories, including the private Zhongxing Iron Factory (manager Han Zhaokui) and Xinhua Electric Welding Factory (manager Lin Xianting), to manufacture them in batches. The unscrupulous merchants Han Zhaokui and Lin Xianting took the lead in organizing a "Processing Committee." They told the capitalists of all the iron factories participating in the processing: "The government does not give a high price, no one should do it." This group of unscrupulous merchants colluded with each other to raise the processing fee and material consumption when signing contracts with the Water Conservancy Bureau, increasing the price of each waterwheel by 360,000 yuan. More seriously, the unscrupulous merchants violated the contract provisions and replaced good materials in large quantities, reducing the specifications of the waterwheels. The materials issued by the public were all high-quality gray pig iron and ingot iron, but the unscrupulous merchants mixed in white pig iron and broken iron slag. When the Wangxiang Iron Factory was casting, the amount of waste iron and broken iron slag mixed in was more than 12,000 jin. At that time, the workers protested and said: "The government calls on us to process and produce, and rush to make waterwheels for farmers to prevent drought. Why do you mix in bad iron?" Manager Wangxiang said shamelessly: "Broken iron is also iron, it doesn't matter." Han Zhaokui, the manager of the Zhongxing Iron Factory, forced the workers who made the chains to cut and stretch the raw materials. The 16-section long chain was originally required to weigh 46 jin, but in reality, only 39 jin of iron was used. Some unscrupulous merchants also collected old ball bearings from the market to replace new ball bearings. The processing of gears and bearings was also very rough. Therefore, most of these waterwheels were substandard. The farmers expressed their dissatisfaction after receiving these waterwheels. Farmers in the Guanzhong area said that when they just installed the waterwheels to resist drought, the waterwheels malfunctioned and had to stop irrigating the fields. A farmer in Fuchen Township, Wugong County, borrowed a waterwheel and the ball bearings broke after only a few days. One farmer was so anxious that he burst into tears. The crimes of this group of unscrupulous merchants seriously endangering the farmers' drought resistance campaign and sabotaging agricultural production aroused the anger of the broad masses of farmers. At the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Conference last year, many labor models accused the unscrupulous merchants of this crime.
    Unscrupulous Merchants in Nanjing Manipulate Grain Prices
    Plundering the Fruits of Farmers' Labor
    Buying low when new grain enters the market and selling high when there is a grain shortage is a common trick used by unscrupulous merchants to exploit farmers. After liberation, illegal capitalists in Nanjing did not obey the leadership of the state-owned economy and continued to stir up trouble with the price difference between industrial and agricultural products. For example, in the spring of 1951, when state-owned trading organizations and cooperatives were not yet widely established in the suburbs, illegal merchants used methods such as raising prices and speculative purchases to sabotage the work of joint purchase and sales groups established by grain and cotton companies, raising the price of cloth to three and a half to five jin of rice for one chi of cloth, which was double the usual price. Usually, the price ratio of rice to wheat is 100 jin of rice for 120 jin of wheat, but the unscrupulous merchants killed the price of rice and raised the price of wheat when rice was on the market; when wheat was on the market, they killed the price of wheat and raised the price of rice, looting farmers' production gains. When wheat entered the market in 1951, before the cooperatives started purchasing, illegal grain merchants lowered the price of wheat from 85,000 yuan per dan to 65,000 yuan, while at the same time raising the price of rice, creating an extremely unreasonable price ratio of two and a half jin of wheat for one jin of rice. When farmers needed to buy wheat, the unscrupulous merchants raised the price of wheat again. In October 1950, grain merchants raised the price ratio of rice to wheat to three jin of rice for one jin of wheat seeds. What is particularly infuriating is that unscrupulous merchants even sold seeds that could not germinate to farmers, sabotaging rural production. In 1949, there was a flood in the Liangpu area, and thousands of farmers did not receive corn seeds. During the summer planting season in 1950, unscrupulous merchants boiled hundreds of shi of corn seeds purchased from other places with boiling water in order to increase the weight and make the color bright. The unscrupulous merchants publicized that these were excellent varieties transported from outside the Guan, raising the price by 60%. The farmers bought this batch of seeds whose germs had been scalded to death, and they did not germinate even after sowing five or six times in a row. This year, farmers in Liangpu, Jiangpu, Liuhe and other places left more than 3,000 mu of land uncultivated as a result. Grain merchants in Tangshan and outside Zhonghua Gate soaked a large number of wheat seeds in boiling water to increase the weight and make the color, making 90% of the wheat unable to germinate. Illegal merchants also did everything possible to sabotage farmers' cooperatives. Almost all of the 18 supply and marketing cooperatives in the suburbs of Nanjing were sabotaged by illegal merchants. According to preliminary statistics, more than 20 merchants sneaked into the 18 rural supply and marketing cooperatives. For example, Lu Wu, who infiltrated the Yanziji Cooperative and occupied the position of deputy manager, reported the news that the grain company was preparing to raise grain prices to the Yanziji grain merchants. Then all the local grain merchants lowered the price of wheat and purchased it in large quantities. When the state-owned company posted price increases, they resold this batch of purchased grain to the cooperative at a high price. (Xinhua News Agency)

    揭穿奸商掠夺农民和危害生产的罪行
    哈尔滨、长春两市奸商
    破坏新农具的推广工作
    东北人民政府为适应发展农业生产的需要，一九五零年曾向哈尔滨、长春两市六十多家私营铁工厂订制大批新式农具。这些私营铁工厂竟乘机合谋抬高标价。如哈尔滨市复兴铁工厂资方知道国家要订制新式农具的消息后，立刻和全市三十六家私营铁工厂合谋，把联合号铲?机的成本费提高百分之二十五，每台定价达三百零六万元（东北币，下同）。又如长春市十二家私营铁工厂在承制一千台铡草机时，把每台定价提高到四百二十万元，实际上每台成本只需二百五十万元。这些不法资本家不仅抬高标价，而且还破坏合同，任意修改图样以偷工减料。如哈尔滨市福生、恒大等铁工厂，曾三次修改农具的图样。铲?机的除草刀，合同规定用一分半厚的铁板，他们只用一分厚的铁板，结果角度不合规格，除不掉草。长春市义大铁工厂承制的一百六十台铡草机，三分之二有砂眼，该厂竟用油泥弥补。为了将这批不合规格的农具交给国家，不法资本家用了各种卑鄙手段收买了人民政府的验收人员。如哈尔滨市复兴铁工厂等的不法资方曾集体贿赂东北人民政府农业部派去验收的干部王家宝，王受贿后，不仅收下了大部分不合规格的产品，并且还欺骗松江省人民政府农林厅说，复兴铁工厂交货快，质量好。结果反而发给这个奸商一千万元奖品和一面奖旗。
    因为这些不法资本家所制造的新式农具大部不合规格，影响了新式农具的推广。如复兴铁工厂所造的复兴一号锄草机，铧身大而陡，铧尖短，?过的地没有浮土，对抗旱抗涝很不利，农民称为“刮地穷”；长春市各私营铁工厂承制的高作除草培土犁也不好使用，农民称为“赔本犁”。现在人民政府已将这批质量很坏的农具陆续收回，国家所遭受的损失共达三百亿元以上。
    西安奸商在承制水车时
    偷工减料危害抗旱运动
    西安市机器业奸商韩兆奎、林显庭等在一九五一年为农民加工制造水车中，偷工减料，粗制滥造，攫取了非法利润十七亿多元。由于水车不合规格，农民在防旱工作中受到难以计算的损失。
    去年陕西省人民政府水利局计划向农民贷放一万二千多辆水车，分批委托私营中兴铁工厂（经理韩兆奎）、新华电焊厂（经理林显庭）等八十几家铁工厂承制。奸商韩兆奎和林显庭领头组织了“加工委员会”，他们对参加加工的全体铁工厂的资方说：“政府不给大价钱，谁都不要做。”这批奸商就互相串通，在和水利局订立合同时抬高加工工缴费和材料消耗量，将每部水车的价格提高了三十六万元。更严重的是奸商们违反合同规定，大量偷换好材料，降低水车规格。公家发的材料都是质量极好的灰生铁和元铁，奸商们却搀入白生铁和碎铁渣子。王祥铁工厂翻砂时，搀入的废铁、碎铁渣子达一万二千多斤，当时工人提出抗议说：“政府号召我们加工生产，为农民赶制水车防止旱灾，你为什么把坏铁搀进去？”经理王祥却无耻地说：“碎铁也是铁，没关系。”中兴铁工厂经理韩兆奎强迫做链条的工人把原材料裁短拉长，十六节长的链子，本来规定重四十六斤，实际上只用了三十九斤铁。有些奸商还搜集市场上的旧滚珠来顶替新滚珠。齿轮和轴承加工也都非常粗糙，因此，这批水车大都是不合规格的。农民领到这批水车后纷纷表示不满，关中地区的农民说：当他们刚将水车安装起来抗旱时，水车就发生了故障，不得不停止灌田。武功县附尘乡农民贷到水车不几天，滚珠就坏了，一个农民因而急得抱头大哭。这批奸商严重地危害农民抗旱运动和破坏农业生产的罪行，激起了广大农民的愤怒。在去年陕西省农业劳动模范会议上，就有许多劳动模范控诉了奸商的这种罪行。
    南京奸商操纵粮食价格
    从中掠夺农民劳动果实
    新谷登场杀价收购，青黄不接高价出售，是奸商压榨农民的惯技。解放以后，南京违法资本家不服从国营经济的领导，继续在工农业产品的差价上兴风作浪。例如一九五一年春国营贸易机构和合作社还没有在郊区普遍设立，不法商人用哄抬价格、套购等手段破坏粮食、花纱布等公司设立的联合收购推销组的工作，把布价提高到三斤半到五斤米换一尺布，比通常提高一倍。通常米、麦比价是一百斤米换一百二十斤小麦，而奸商在稻子上市的时候，杀稻价抬麦价；在麦子上市的时候，又杀麦价抬米价，从中劫掠农民生产所得。一九五一年小麦登场，在合作社未开始收购以前，违法粮商把八万五千元一担的麦子压低到六万五千元，同时又把米价提高，造成二斤半麦子换一斤米的极不合理的比价。到农民需要购买麦子的时候，奸商又把麦价抬高。一九五零年十月，粮商把米、麦比价哄抬到三斤米换一斤小麦种。特别令人愤恨的，是奸商竟把不能发芽的种子卖给农民，破坏农村生产。一九四九年两浦地区闹水灾，数千户农民没有收到苞谷种子。一九五零年夏种期间，奸商为了涨秤涨斗、颜色鲜明，竟将由外地购进的几百石苞谷种子用沸水泡过。奸商们大肆宣传说这是从关外运来的优良品种，把价格抬高六成。农民买了这批芽胚已经烫死的种子，连续下种五六次也没有发芽。这一年，两浦、江浦、六合等地农民，因此荒芜了三千多亩地。汤山和中华门外的粮商把大批麦种用开水浸泡、涨秤涨斗做色，使百分之九十的麦子不能发芽。不法商人对农民的合作社也千方百计地进行破坏，南京郊区十八个供销合作社，差不多全都遭受到不法商人的破坏。据初步统计，在十八个农村供销合作社里，钻进来的商人有二十多个。如混进燕子矶合作社盘据副经理职位的吕午，他把粮食公司准备提高粮价的消息报告燕子矶粮商后，当地所有粮商就压低麦价，大量收购。到国营公司挂牌涨价的时候，他们就把这批收购的粮食高价转售给合作社。    （据新华社消息）
