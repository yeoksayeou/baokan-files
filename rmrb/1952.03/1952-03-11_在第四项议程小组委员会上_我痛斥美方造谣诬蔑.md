    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th. At the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee meeting of the Korean armistice talks on March 10th, our representative pointed out that the other party's irresponsible fabrication and slander regarding our side having transported prisoners of war outside of Korea only proves that the other party has been unable to find any decent arguments to defend its untenable position and has had to resort to blatant fabrications to delay the negotiations. Our representative specifically reviewed our side's efforts to resolve the fourth agenda item, and particularly pointed out that since our side put forward the March 5th proposal, today is the sixth day, and the other party has consistently disregarded our reasonable proposals, continued to adhere to its unreasonable demands, and resorted to all kinds of rumors and slanders, making our side suspect whether the other party has any sincerity in resolving the problem.
    At the Third Agenda Staff Meeting, both parties agreed that the translators from both sides would begin proofreading the text of the already agreed-upon sections of the armistice agreement draft on the 11th.

    在第四项议程小组委员会上
    我痛斥美方造谣诬蔑
    【新华社开城十日电】三月十日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程小组委员会上，我方代表指出对方关于我方曾将战俘运至朝鲜境外的不负责任的捏造和诬蔑，只能证明对方已找不到任何像样的论点为其站不住的立场辩护，而不得不诉之于公然的捏造以拖延谈判。我方代表具体回溯我方为解决第四项议程所作的努力，并特别指出自从我方提出三月五日建议以来，到今天已经是第六天，对方始终置我方的合理建议于不顾，继续坚持对方的无理主张，造谣诬蔑无所不用其极，使我方怀疑对方究竟有无解决问题的诚意。
    第三项议程参谋会议上，双方协议由双方翻译人员在十一日开始校正停战协定草案中已协议部分的文字。
