    Unscrupulous Merchants in Chengdu and Other Places Harmed the PLA Troops Entering Tibet
    People in Various Parts of Southwest China Demand the Government Punish Them Severely

    The people of Chengdu and Ya'an have exposed another group of unscrupulous merchants who harmed the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet. The most heinous elements have been arrested and brought to justice by the People's Government. These unscrupulous merchants, in 1950 and 1951, accepted the entrustment of the PLA troops entering Tibet for the processing and ordering of a large number of military supplies, food, machinery, leather, tea, etc. They did not hesitate to harm the people's troops, drastically cutting corners, using inferior goods as good ones, stealing state property, hindering the advance, and affecting the health of many soldiers fighting on glaciers and snow mountains. Wang Laizhen, factory director, and Kang Jihong, manager, of the private Xinzhong Agricultural Company in Chengdu, successively undertook the production of a large number of substitute rice flour, cured meat, and sausages for the troops entering Tibet. They not only raised the processing fee by 46 percent, but also used corn flour to impersonate egg yolk powder, reduced the content of milk powder and monosodium glutamate, and even did not cook the bean flour. Such "substitute rice flour" was not only low in nutritional value, but also mostly raw. Even more hateful: they smeared five thousand catties of rotten, maggot-infested stinking meat with salt and sold it to the troops entering Tibet at a high price. In Ya'an City, unscrupulous merchants such as Diao Chewu of Xinxi Yuan and Yiju Tea Factory not only raised the unit price and added water to increase the weight of the more than 18,000 packages of tea ordered by the troops entering Tibet, but also mixed in more than half of the "second water tea" that had been soaked and dried, "scooped tea" from the water pot, old, thick stalks with no tea taste, and unrefined raw tea. The main food on the Kangzang Plateau is tsampa. Tea must be drunk after eating tsampa for digestion. The bad tea supplied by the unscrupulous merchants seriously damaged the health of the soldiers.

    People in various parts of Southwest China have strongly condemned the unscrupulous merchants who harmed the PLA troops entering Tibet. Awang Jiacuo, member of the Tibetan Autonomous Region Consultative Committee of Xikang Province, Riku Living Buddha of Riku Temple in Kangding, and Xia Ke Dao Deng, deputy director of the Support Tibet Liberation Committee of various counties in northern Kang, issued statements unanimously demanding that the People's Government severely punish the unscrupulous merchants who harmed the PLA. Xia Ke Dao Deng said: "The PLA endures all hardships to defend the happy life of all ethnic groups in the motherland, climbs snow mountains and crosses grasslands to station in the border areas. The people of our entire region contribute livestock and grain to support the PLA; many have even given their lives. The conscienceless unscrupulous merchants cut corners in the military supplies they produced for the troops entering Tibet, and even made fake medicines to harm the PLA, which is intolerable to the people of our entire region." Newspapers in various parts of Southwest China have received many letters from readers, demanding that the People's Government severely punish the unscrupulous merchants who harmed the troops entering Tibet. Lei Wenhan of the Transportation Brigade of a certain unit of the PLA troops entering Tibet wrote to the Sichuan West Daily, accusing the unscrupulous merchants of their crimes. He said: "When we received a large number of cotton clothes, shoes, tent poles, and other things sent from the rear on Mount Que'er, which is known as the 'Roof of the World' at an altitude of 5,300 meters above sea level, everyone was very excited. But the tent poles were worm-eaten and could not withstand the wind and snow, and they broke quickly. The leather shoes broke after only a few days of wear, and some comrades had their toes frostbitten by the ice and snow." Li Nanli, a literary and art worker in the Southwest Military Region, said: Our heroes risked their lives to send dry food to the troops entering Tibet. However, the unscrupulous merchants put many shoddy and rotten things in this dry food, which seriously damaged the health of the soldiers. He asked the People's Government to sanction them.

    成都等地奸商暗害解放军入藏部队
    西南各地人民要求政府严予惩办
    成都、雅安两地人民又检举出一批暗害中国人民解放军入藏部队的奸商。其中罪大恶极的分子已被人民政府逮捕法办。这批奸商都曾在一九五零年和一九五一年间，接受人民解放军入藏部队大批军需食品、机械、皮革、茶叶等的委托加工和定货。他们竟不惜暗害人民部队，大肆偷工减料，以劣货充好货，盗窃国家财产，妨碍了进军和影响了许多和冰河雪山搏斗的战士们的健康。成都市私营心中农业公司厂长王来珍、经理康纪鸿，先后承制了大批供入藏部队食用的代饭粉、腌肉和香肠。他们不仅高抬加工费百分之四十六，并且不按合同规定，用玉蜀黍粉冒充蛋黄粉，减轻奶粉和味精的含量，甚至不把豆粉炒熟。这样的“代饭粉”不仅营养价值低，并且很多是生的。更令人痛恨的是：他们把五千斤腐烂生蛆的臭肉抹上盐以高价卖给入藏部队。雅安市新西远、义举茶厂奸商刁车伍等在入藏部队向他们定制的一万八千多包茶叶中，除了提高单价、搀水增加重量外，并混入一半以上泡用过后晒干的“二水茶”、从水锅里捞出来的“捞锅茶”、没有一点茶味的老粗梗子和未制过的生茶。康藏高原上的主要食物是糌巴。吃糌巴后一定要喝茶才得消化。奸商们供给的这些坏茶，严重地损害了战士们的健康。
    西南各地人民纷纷声讨暗害人民解放军入藏部队的奸商。西康省藏族自治区协商委员会委员阿旺嘉错、康定日库寺日库活佛和康北各县支援解放西藏委员会副主任夏克刀登等发表谈话，一致要求人民政府严惩暗害人民解放军的奸商。夏克刀登说：“解放军为保卫祖国各族人民的幸福生活，忍受一切艰难困苦，翻雪山过草地进驻边疆，我们全区人民为了支援解放军，贡献出牲口、粮食；还有不少人献出了生命。丧尽天良的奸商却在承制入藏部队的军需品中偷工减料，甚至制造假药暗害解放军，这是我们全区人民不能容忍的。”西南各地报社都收到许多读者的信，他们要求人民政府严办暗害入藏部队的奸商。人民解放军入藏部队某部运输大队雷文翰投书川西日报，控诉奸商罪行。他说：“我们在号称‘世界屋脊’拔海五千三百公尺的雀儿山上，接到后方送来的大批棉衣、鞋子、帐篷杆等东西时，大家都万分兴奋。可是帐篷杆是虫蚀了的，经不起风刮雪压，很快就折断了。皮鞋穿不上几天就破了，有的同志被冰雪冻坏了脚趾。”西南军区文艺工作人员李南力说：我们的英雄们冒着生命的危险，把干粮送给入藏部队。可是奸商们却在这些干粮中放着许多偷工减料和霉烂了的东西，严重地损害了战士们的健康。他要求人民政府予以制裁。
