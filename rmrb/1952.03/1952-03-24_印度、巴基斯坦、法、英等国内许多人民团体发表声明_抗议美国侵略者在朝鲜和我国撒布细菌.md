Xinhua News Agency report: People in India, Pakistan, France, Britain, the Netherlands, and Australia are rising up to protest against American imperialism's germ warfare in Korea and China.

　　Four thousand textile workers in Delhi held a meeting on March 9th. Sharma, the secretary of the Delhi United Progressive League, severely condemned the crime of American imperialists dropping germ bombs on the territories of Korea and the People's Republic of China at the meeting. He called on the Indian people to protest against this crime. In the Kaluri village of Budwan district in West Bengal province, five hundred farmers held a meeting on the 12th. The meeting passed a resolution expressing strong hatred and indignation at the germ warfare conducted by American imperialists and demanded that the criminals be punished. Karangi, editor of "Blitz Weekly" and president of the Bombay India-China Friendship Association, condemned the crime of germ warfare by American aggressors, saying: The Bombay India-China Friendship Association and the people of India are very angry about this crime of American aggressors. He called on all countries to protest to the United Nations against this atrocity. A cultural peace conference held in the Hezra area of South Calcutta on the 16th passed a resolution angrily protesting against the germ warfare conducted by American aggressors and demanding that the masterminds of this barbaric act be declared war criminals. Sixteen peace movement leaders, writers, musicians, composers, and poets from West Bengal province signed a statement condemning the U.S. for waging germ warfare and demanding that the United Nations immediately stop it.

　　According to a report by the Pakistan United Press Agency: The Peace Committee of Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, supports Joliot-Curie's call for people of all countries to protest against the germ warfare waged by American imperialism. The Peace Committee urged all parties in Pakistan to demand that the United Nations ban the use of atomic weapons and germ weapons.

　　The Standing Committee of the French National Peace Council issued a declaration on the 20th, calling on the French people to "protest against germ warfare and demand with unprecedented determination that weapons of mass destruction be banned." The declaration condemned U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's attempt to deny the fact that American bandits used germ weapons. The declaration emphasized: The Standing Committee believes that mere denial and suggestions for "investigation" are unacceptable and unsatisfactory. This is reminiscent of the crimes of mass extermination of human beings in Nazi concentration camps, which today no one can dispute, and which were initially also the object of denial and "investigation," but produced no results.

　　The British working people expressed their anger at the crimes of the American aggressors. According to the London "Workers' Daily" report: The Dartford City Branch of the British Electrical Workers' Union sent a telegram to British Prime Minister Churchill saying: We despise the inhuman germ warfare waged by the United States in Korea and Northeast China and request the Prime Minister to do everything possible to stop this war.

　　In the Netherlands, the Dutch Communist Party organ "Truth Daily" published a protest from the Dutch Women's Movement and a protest passed by a meeting of the Dutch Youth League in Amsterdam on the 19th. At a rally held in the port of Amsterdam, dockworker Subers said: "This action by the Americans is not enough to prove their strength, but it just exposes their helplessness. Mankind can never forgive the American rulers who issued this order. The majority of the Dutch people, regardless of party affiliation or belief, unanimously condemn this barbaric act of the American aggressors."

　　In Australia, the Australian Communist Party organ "Tribune" commented on the crime of the American aggressors waging germ warfare on the 19th: "The aggressive American imperialism has reached the end of its road, and like a cornered dog, it uses all vicious means and struggles desperately to stop the progress of history. The Australian people should consider this: Plague and disease do not recognize national boundaries." Australian trade union leaders have issued statements condemning the American aggressors for waging germ warfare.

    印度、巴基斯坦、法、英等国内许多人民团体发表声明
    抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国撒布细菌
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：印度、巴基斯坦、法国、英国、荷兰和澳大利亚各地人民群起抗议美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战。
    德里的四千名纺织工人在三月九日举行集会。德里统一进步联盟书记夏尔玛在会上严厉斥责美帝国主义者在朝鲜和中华人民共和国领土上投掷细菌弹的罪行。他号召印度人民抗议这种罪行。在西孟加拉省布得温区的卡路里村，五百个农民在十二日举行集会。会议通过决议，对美帝国主义者进行细菌战表示强烈的痛恨和愤慨，并要求惩罚罪犯。“闪电周报”编辑兼孟买印中友好协会会长卡朗吉痛斥美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行说：对于美国侵略者的这一罪行，孟买印中友好协会和印度全国人民一样，非常愤怒。他呼吁各国向联合国组织提出抗议，反对美国的这种暴行。”在南加尔各答海兹拉地区举行的文化和平会议，在十六日通过决议，愤慨地抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战，并要求宣布这种野蛮行为的主谋者为战争罪犯。西孟加拉省的和平运动领袖、作家、音乐家、作曲家和诗人共十六人，签署了一项声明，谴责美国进行细菌战，并要求联合国立即予以制止。
    另据巴基斯坦统一通讯社消息：巴基斯坦首都喀喇蚩的和平委员会拥护约里奥—居里号召世界各国人民抗议美帝国主义进行细菌战的声明。和平委员会力促巴基斯坦所有党派要求联合国禁止使用原子武器和细菌武器。
    法国全国和平理事会常设委员会在二十日发表宣言，号召法国人民“抗议细菌战并空前坚决地要求禁止大规模屠杀的武器”。宣言斥责美国国务卿艾奇逊企图抵赖美国匪徒使用细菌武器的事实。宣言着重指出：常设委员会认为一味抵赖和进行“调查”的建议是不能被接受的和不能令人满意的。这使人想起了纳粹集中营中大规模消灭人类的罪行，这在今日已不再有人能够置辩了，而当初，这也曾经是否认与“调查”的目标，但是没有产生任何结果。
    英国劳动人民对于美国侵略者的罪行表示愤怒。据伦敦“工人日报”报道：英国电气工会肯特郡达特福德城分会致电英国首相邱吉尔说：我们对于美国在朝鲜及中国东北进行没有人性的细菌战表示鄙视，并要求首相尽一切可能来制止这种战争。
    在荷兰，荷兰共产党机关报“真理报”十九日刊载了荷兰妇运会的抗议和荷兰青年联盟在阿姆斯特丹举行的会议所通过的抗议。在阿姆斯特丹港举行的一个集会上，码头工人苏伯斯说：“美国人这种行动并不足以证明他们的力量，反而正好暴露了他们的没有办法。人类永远不能宽恕发出这种命令的美国统治者。荷兰大多数人民，不分党派和信仰，一致斥责美国侵略者这种野蛮的暴行。”
    在澳大利亚，澳大利亚共产党机关报“论坛报”十九日评论美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行说：“进行侵略的美帝国主义已经到了穷途末路，狗急跳墙，它就使出所有恶毒的手段，拚命挣扎，想要阻止历史的前进。澳大利亚人民应该考虑到这一点：鼠疫和疾病是不认识国界的。”澳大利亚的工会领袖们纷纷发表声明，斥责美国侵略者进行细菌战。
