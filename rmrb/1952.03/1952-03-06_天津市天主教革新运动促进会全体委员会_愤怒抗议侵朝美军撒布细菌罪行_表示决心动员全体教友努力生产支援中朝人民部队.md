[This Newspaper's dispatch] The Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association All-Committee issued a statement on March 1st on behalf of all Catholics in Tianjin, protesting the US military's germ warfare in Korea. The statement said: When we Catholics in Tianjin heard that American imperialism was using bacteriological weapons in Korea to massacre the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean military and civilians, we all felt deep hatred and unparalleled anger. The American beasts used airplanes to bomb peaceful villages and cities in Korea on a large scale, massacring a large number of peaceful residents and destroying countless beautiful towns and villages. However, the brutality of American imperialism has not only failed to conquer the Korean people, but has instead aroused the anger and resistance of the Korean people, causing American imperialism to suffer defeat. The American beasts, in order to cover up their failure and delay the armistice negotiations, are using bacteriological weapons to massacre people. American imperialism's spreading of germs in Korea is a declaration of war against humanity and justice, and a declaration of war against the people of the world. We, all 17,000 Catholics in Tianjin, fully support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement and demand that the people of the world stop the atrocities of the American imperialists and investigate the international responsibility of the organizers who use bacteriological weapons. We respond to the call of Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression, to mobilize all Catholics to actively participate in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and to strive for production to support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and to eliminate the American imperialist invading forces that endanger world peace. All of our Catholics must do a good job in the Three-Self Reform Movement, eliminate imperialist elements and imperialist influence within the church, and increase the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea.

    愤怒抗议侵朝美军撒布细菌罪行
    表示决心动员全体教友努力生产支援中朝人民部队
    【本报讯】天津市天主教革新运动促进会全体委员会在三月一日代表天津市全体天主教徒发表声明，抗议侵朝美军撒布细菌。声明称：我们天津市的天主教徒听到美帝国主义在朝鲜使用细菌武器，屠杀中国人民志愿军和朝鲜军民时，一致感到切齿的痛恨与无比的愤怒。美国野兽用飞机大规模轰炸朝鲜的和平乡村与城市，屠杀了大量和平居民，毁灭了无数的美丽的城镇与村庄。但是，美帝国主义的残暴，不但没有征服了朝鲜人民，相反地更激起朝鲜人民的愤怒与反抗，使美帝国主义遭到了失败。美国野兽们，为了掩盖他们的失败，拖延停战谈判，更使用细菌武器来屠杀人民。美帝国主义在朝鲜撒布病菌，这是对人道和正义的宣战，是对全世界人民宣战。我们全天津市一万七千名天主教徒完全拥护周恩来外长的声明，要求全世界人民制止美帝国主义者的暴行，追究使用细菌武器的组织者的国际责任。我们响应我们保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会郭沫若主席的号召，动员全体教徒积极参加反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争，并努力生产支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，消灭危害世界和平的美帝国主义侵略军队。我们全体教友要搞好三自革新运动，肃清教内的帝国主义分子和帝国主义的影响，增加抗美援朝的力量。
