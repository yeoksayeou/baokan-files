    Beijing Tianyi Grain Store Manager Wen Jingyu
    Should Be Punished for Enticing Cadres to Steal and Sell Grain

    To the Editor: Wen Jingyu, manager of the Tianyi Grain Store outside Andingmen, Beijing, in order to make exorbitant profits, used extremely vile methods to entice procurement personnel from the military to steal and sell large quantities of rice, grain, and horse feed, defrauding the state of grain. According to incomplete statistics, the amount exceeds 51,000 catties.

    This unscrupulous merchant began his attack on our procurement personnel as early as October 1949, often saying to our procurement personnel, "The army is very poor, I can lend you some money if you need it." He used tactics such as inviting them to see plays, eat meals, and take baths to entice cadres, even resorting to using his wife to seduce cadres. Some cadres with weak wills were fooled by him, and currently, six people from my unit alone have been dragged into this.

    During the anti-bribery and anti-theft of state property campaign, the unscrupulous merchant Wen Jingyu not only did not confess his crimes to the government, but he also came to my unit in an attempt to prevent those who had been pulled in from confessing. I believe that the government should severely punish this lawless merchant Wen Jingyu and recover all the property he defrauded from the state.

    北京天一粮店经理温敬瑜
    勾引干部盗卖粮食应受惩处
    编辑同志：北京市安定门外天一粮店经理温敬瑜，为了牟取暴利，竟用极卑鄙的手段，拉拢部队采购人员，大量盗卖米粮、马料，骗取国家粮食，据不完全统计，数达五万一千斤以上。
    这个奸商从一九四九年十月以来，就开始向我们的采购人员进攻，常对我们的采购人员说：“军队很苦，没钱花我可以借给你们几个用”。他用请看戏、吃饭、洗澡等手段，拉拢干部，甚至不惜以他的老婆勾引干部。一些意志薄弱的干部，竟上了他的当，现只我部被拉下水的就有六人。
    在反行贿、反盗窃国家资财运动中，奸商温敬瑜不但不向政府坦白认罪，他还跑到我部来，企图阻止被拉人员坦白。我认为政府应严惩温敬瑜这种无法无天的奸商，并追索其骗取国家的全部财产。
