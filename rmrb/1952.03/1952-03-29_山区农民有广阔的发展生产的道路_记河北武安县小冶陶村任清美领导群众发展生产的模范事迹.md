Mountain Farmers Have Broad Roads for Developing Production
    ——A Record of the Model Deeds of Ren Qingmei, Leader of the Masses in Xiaoyetao Village, Wu'an County, Hebei, in Developing Production
    Wang Shoumin
    Xiaoyetao Village in Wu'an County, Hebei Province, used to be a poor mountain village. Under the leadership of the Communist Party branch and the Communist Party member and labor model Ren Qingmei, the villagers organized themselves to plant trees and develop animal husbandry; now this mountain village has become a prosperous village.
    Xiaoyetao Village is surrounded by mountains, with thick rocks and thin soil, and only narrow terraced fields and shallow slopes. The village has 180 households, with an average of only one mu of land per person. In 1943, the whole village had only three head of draft animals, seven sheep, and five plows, and the level of production was very low, and the lives of the peasants were very hard. However, in recent years, under the active leadership of the Communist Party village branch and labor model Ren Qingmei, the face of Xiaoyetao Village has greatly changed. The level of agricultural production has doubled compared with before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the number of livestock such as cattle and mules has increased from three in 1943 to 150, and the number of sheep has increased from seven to more than 300. Fruit trees and forests have been planted on the edges of the village, along the river banks, and on the mountain tops, and crops have grown on the barren slopes, white sheep run all over the mountains, and yellow cattle have become herds. Although it suffered a serious hailstorm in 1950, very few people are eating bran and wild herbs. All 180 households in the village have reached the living standards of middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants. Farmer Wang Zhifu said: "In the past, all the family property could be carried away in one load, but now 100 loads of millet cannot be exchanged for it."
    How did Xiaoyetao Village become prosperous? The main reason is that it has conscientiously embarked on the road of "organizing" as instructed by Chairman Mao, and found the correct direction for developing production in mountainous areas. The peasants of Xiaoyetao Village began to organize in 1943, and now, all 180 households and more than 300 male and female laborers in the village have joined mutual aid groups. Before 1943, Xiaoyetao Village suffered from drought for many years, coupled with the destruction of the Japanese invaders, and the lives of the peasants in the whole village were very difficult. At that time, how could we overcome natural disasters and man-made calamities? Ren Qingmei believed that only by implementing Chairman Mao's instruction of "organizing" could this be achieved. He and 18 Communist Party members and cadres united the masses and began to organize 15 mutual aid groups; at the same time, he led the masses to establish a cooperative, dug a canal, built three water mills, and carried out sideline production, so that the income from sideline production increased rapidly, and initially solved the difficulties in the production and life of the masses. In 1943, all male and female laborers in the village, except for 19 lazy people, had been organized. In order to transform the lazy people and achieve the goal of organizing all the peasants in the village to develop production, Ren Qingmei said to Guo Dashun, the leader of the lazy people who had little to eat or drink: "Look, all the men and women in the village are organized, and labor is so glorious! If you can also reclaim wasteland and cultivate land, you won't be hungry." After his patient education, Guo Dashun finally joined the mutual aid group; soon more than a dozen other lazy people were also organized and worked hard to produce. After the whole village was organized, under the guidance of the local people's government, Ren Qingmei began to lead the mutual aid groups to improve farming techniques. He led the experienced old farmers in the village to set up a technical committee; each mutual aid group also established a "small farm" to specialize in experiments on fertilization, varieties, and improving farming techniques, which resulted in increased yields and consolidated the mutual aid groups. In the past, the wheat planted in this village suffered from "black ear disease" year after year, and the yield was very low, with an average of only four dou per mu; in order to increase the wheat yield, Ren Qingmei went to Shexian County to buy "gourd head" wheat seeds with strong resistance to black ear disease, and distributed them to various mutual aid groups for trial planting. In the same year, the average yield of this kind of wheat increased to one stone and two dou per mu. Through organization and improved technology, the yield per unit area of farmland in Xiaoyetao Village has increased year by year.
    "In this poor mountain ravine, it is not easy to use new-style farm tools, let alone large machines. How can we further develop agricultural production so as to transition to socialism in the future?" Ren Qingmei is a labor model and also a Communist Party member, and he is often worried about this matter. In 1949, he joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and heard others talk about the many scientific achievements of the Soviet Union in agriculture; this gave him great inspiration. In January 1950, he went to Baoding, Hebei Province, to attend a meeting and watched the Soviet film "Michurin." Since then, he has found the road to developing production in mountainous areas. He thought: "Our village has plenty of barren mountains and dry rivers. Planting trees and transforming nature is our direction of development."
    After Ren Qingmei returned to the village, he first surveyed the environment and terrain of the village, and formulated a plan to "turn Dongjin Mountain into an orchard and the dry river beach into a willow forest," and submitted it to the Xiaoyetao Village Branch of the Communist Party of China for consideration. After studying his plan, the branch believed that afforestation was a long-term construction plan for a hundred years, so it made a decision based on his opinion and widely publicized it to the masses. At that time, many peasants had the idea of quick success of "planting trees today and enjoying the shade tomorrow" and were not interested in afforestation. Some said: "We plant trees every year, and we plant a lot, but not many survive." Some said: "We are not afraid of running out of firewood by relying on the mountains. Why plant trees?" In response to this idea of the peasants, Ren Qingmei widely publicized to the peasants the experience of Michurin in successfully planting fruit trees in the coldest places, and encouraged the peasants' enthusiasm for planting trees; he also used concrete facts to point out the prospects for afforestation in mountainous areas. He said: "The small fruit trees planted by Guo Huaijun in our village six years ago can now pick 60 jin of fruit per tree. If we plant 5,000 fruit trees this year, we can harvest 300,000 jin of fruit every year after ten years, which is several times more than the agricultural income of the whole village. High income, less delay in work, benefiting both the country and ourselves." These words have been widely brewing in the streets, rice markets, mutual aid groups, fields, and along the edges of the land; everyone thinks that Old Ren's words are right, and they are all willing to plant trees. In the spring of 1950, with the lead of activists Guo Laoer, Guo Mingtang and others, they bought saplings everywhere, solving the problem of the lack of saplings. As a result, a mass tree-planting movement was launched. The village drama troupe proposed to build a "drama troupe forest"; young men and women proposed to build a "youth forest." During the movement, Ren Qingmei patiently provided technical guidance and put forward the slogan of "plant one tree, let one tree live," and taught the masses tree-planting techniques. They determined that willows should be planted on river beaches, walnuts should be planted in black soil, and apricot trees should be planted in red soil, according to the soil quality and tree growth. During afforestation, the farmers dug several canals, and the young trees were irrigated. In order to protect the young forest, Ren Qingmei led the farmers to establish a forest protection committee and formulate a forest protection covenant. As a result, all the more than 5,000 trees planted this year survived. Liu Zhenfu, secretary of the Xiaoyetao Village Branch of the Communist Party of China, led the masses to form a grafting research group to teach the peasants how to graft fruit trees.
    At the beginning of 1951, the whole village set a plan to plant 10,000 trees. In the spring, 9,550 trees were planted, 31 orchards were established, 11 cooperative forests were planted, and four and a half mu of seedlings were also cultivated. In the summer, the grafting research group grafted plum trees into apple trees and small jujube trees into large jujube trees for the peasants, totaling 218 trees. In the autumn, 3,000 walnut trees were planted on the barren mountains. Planting trees has become a trend in Xiaoyetao Village. Now they are further studying Michurin, researching the use of artificial pollination to improve fruit trees, and the safe wintering of fruit trees.
    In 1950, the Wu'an County People's Government made Ren Qingmei's deeds of leading the masses to study Michurin into slides and showed them everywhere, and clearly pointed out that learning from Michurin, developing fruit tree gardening, and planting trees is the direction for developing production in mountainous areas. As a result, Ren Qingmei's model deeds quickly spread to all villages in the county. Everyone said: "Ren Qingmei is learning from Michurin, and we want to learn from Ren Qingmei." Under the influence of Ren Qingmei, a vigorous tree-planting movement was launched in Wu'an County in 1951, with a total of 458,000 trees planted, 80 orchards established, and 35 mu of large white poplars cultivated.
    In addition to planting trees, Ren Qingmei also led the masses to raise livestock and improve cattle breeds, so that the peasants in the whole village gradually moved towards a more prosperous road.
    In the spring of 1951, when Ren Qingmei returned from the labor model conference in Handan Prefecture, he planned to improve the cattle breeds in the village. He thought: Henan Luohe cattle eat less, breed faster, plow the land, and carry things, which can顶个骡子 [be as good as a mule], which is of great benefit to developing production in mountainous areas; the local cattle breeds are not good, they grow small, and they also walk slowly. So he was determined to improve the cattle breeds. He used the example of Guo Yongzhen's cow breeding two calves in three years to publicize to the masses and stimulate the farmers' interest in buying cattle. Everyone said: "This is a good thing." However, Xiaoyetao, which suffered a serious hailstorm in 1950, had no surplus grain for most farmers, so where did the funds come from to buy cattle? Ren Qingmei and the Party branch studied this situation and believed that the confidence in buying cattle should not be shaken because of difficulties, so they put forward the slogan of "turning dead property into living capital" and called on the peasants to concentrate floating capital to develop animal husbandry. Under Ren Qingmei's patient persuasion and mobilization, every family calculated the household accounts, and the mutual aid groups formulated plans to buy cattle, and men, women, old and young actively invested and implemented mutual assistance and mutual aid. Some borrowed money from relatives and friends; some sold gold and silver jewelry. They said: "Keeping these dead properties is useless, and buying yellow cattle can plow the land." Some are preparing to go out to do short-term work and engage in sideline production to earn money to buy cattle. In this way, 66 households concentrated a total of 13 million yuan of floating capital and set a plan to buy 58 cows. Ren Qingmei borrowed part of the money from the county and personally bought 41 cows from Luohe. These cattle have already given birth to calves. The peasants saw that the Luohe cattle pulled, carried, and walked like mules, and were very happy, and set a plan to buy another 50 heads. Ren Xingyin, a 76-year-old man, said: "I have lived my whole life, and I have only seen sheep being bought in flocks, but I have never seen cattle being bought in flocks. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, everything is different." In addition, they will also breed more flocks of sheep, and they will also do their best to feed a pig in each family and raise a chicken for each person. Under the influence of Ren Qingmei, farmers in the nearby 18 villages have set plans to improve cattle breeds. They said: "Following the Communist Party and learning from Ren Qingmei can find the way for long-term construction in mountainous areas."

    山区农民有广阔的发展生产的道路
    ——记河北武安县小冶陶村任清美领导群众发展生产的模范事迹
    王守民
    河北省武安县小冶陶村从前是一个穷山村。在共产党支部和共产党员、劳动模范任清美领导下，全村农民组织起来，植树造林，发展畜牧；现在这个山庄已经变成了一个富裕的村落。
    小冶陶村四面环山，石厚土薄，只有窄小的梯田，薄浅的坡地。全村一百八十户，每人平均只有一亩土地。一九四三年时，全村只有三头耕畜、七只羊、五部犁，生产水平很低，农民生活很苦。但是，几年来，小冶陶村在共产党村支部和劳动模范任清美的积极领导下，面貌大大地改观了。农业生产水平比抗日战争前提高了一倍，牛骡等牲畜由一九四三年的三头增加到一百五十头，羊由七只增加到三百多只。村边、河畔、山头都栽上了果树林，荒凉的山坡也长起了庄稼，白羊满山跑，黄牛成了群。一九五零年虽然遭受了严重的雹灾，但吃糠咽菜的人已经很少。全村一百八十户人家都达到了中农和富裕中农的生活水平。农民王治富说：“过去的家当一担子就能挑完，现在一百担小米也不换了。”
    小冶陶村是怎样富裕起来的呢？主要原因是认真地走上了毛主席所指示的“组织起来”的道路，和找到了发展山区生产的正确方向。小冶陶村的农民从一九四三年开始组织起来，到现在，全村一百八十户，三百多个男女劳动力，全部参加了互助组。一九四三年以前，小冶陶村连年遭受了旱灾，加上日寇的破坏，全村农民生活非常困难。当时怎样才能战胜天灾和人祸呢？任清美认为只有执行毛主席指示的“组织起来”的路线。他和十八个共产党员、干部团结群众，开始组织了十五个互助组；同时他又领导群众成立了一个合作社，开挖了一条水渠，修建了三盘水磨，进行副业生产，使副业生产的收入迅速增加，初步解决了群众生产和生活上的困难。一九四三年时，全村除十九个懒汉外，所有男女劳动力都已组织起来。任清美为了改造懒汉，达到把全村农民组织起来发展生产的目的，就向少吃没喝的懒汉头子郭大顺说：“你看全村男女都组织起来了，劳动多光荣！你要是也能开荒种地，也就不会挨饿了。”经过他的耐心教育，郭大顺终于参加了互助组；不久其他十几个懒汉也组织起来，努力生产了。全村组织起来以后，在当地人民政府的指导下，任清美开始领导互助组改进耕作技术。他领导村里有生产经验的老农成立了一个技术委员会；各个互助组也都建立了“小农场”，专做施肥、品种和提高耕作技术的试验，结果提高了产量，也巩固了互助组。过去这村种的小麦连年发生“黑穗病”，产量很低，每亩平均只收四斗；任清美为了提高小麦产量，就跑到涉县买了抗黑穗病力强的“葫芦头”麦种，分给各个互助组试种。当年试种的这种小麦，每亩平均产量提高到一石二斗。经过组织起来，改进技术，小冶陶村的农田的单位面积产量一年比一年提高了。
    “在这个穷山沟里，不好使用新式农具，更不好使用大机器，要怎样才能更进一步地发展农业生产，以便将来过渡到社会主义呢？”任清美是一个劳动模范，也是一个共产党员，他经常为这个事情发愁。一九四九年他参加了中苏友好协会，听到了别人谈苏联在农业方面的许多科学成就；这给了他很大的启示。一九五○年一月，他到河北省保定开会，看了苏联电影片“米邱林”。他从此找到了山地发展生产的道路。他想：“我村有的是荒山、干河，植树造林，改造自然，就是我们的发展方向。”
    任清美回到村里，首先勘察了本村的环境和地形，订出“把东禁山变成果木园，把干河滩变成柳树林”的计划，并提请中共小冶陶村支部考虑。支部研究了他的计划以后，认为植树造林是长期建设的百年大计，于是根据他的意见，做成了决定，并向群众广泛宣传。当时许多农民有“今天栽上树，明天就乘凉”的速利思想，对植树造林不感兴趣。有的说：“年年栽树，种的不少，活的不多。”有的说：“靠山不怕没柴烧，种树干啥？”任清美针对农民这种思想，广泛地向农民宣传米邱林在最冷的地方试种果树成功的经验，鼓舞起农民的植树热情；他并用具体事实指出山区植树造林的远景。他说：“前六年咱村郭怀钧栽的小果树，现在每株能摘六十斤果子了。咱们今年如果栽上五千棵果树，十年之后，每年可收果子三十万斤，比全村的农业收入还要多好几倍。收入大，误工少，既利国家，又利自己。”这些话在街头、饭市、互助组、场上、地边普遍地酝酿起来了；大家都认为老任的话说得对，都愿意植树了。一九五零年春天，由积极分子郭老二、郭明堂等人带头，到各处买树秧，解决了树秧缺乏的问题。于是，群众性的植树运动就开展起来了。村剧团提出造“剧团林”；青年男女提出造“青年林”。在运动中，任清美耐心地进行技术指导，提出“种一株，活一株”的口号，教给群众植树技术。他们根据土质和树木生长情况，确定河滩栽杨柳，黑土栽核桃，红土栽杏树。在造林中，农民们挖了几道水渠，幼树都得到灌溉。为保护幼林，任清美又领导农民成立了护林委员会，制订了护林公约。结果，这一年栽的五千多株树全部成活了。中共小冶陶村支部书记刘珍福又领导群众组成一个接树研究组，教给农民接种果树。
    一九五一年初，全村又定出植树一万株的计划。春季种树九千五百五十株，建立了三十一处果木园，植了十一个合作林，还养了四亩半地的树苗。夏季，接树研究组给农民把李子树接成苹果树，小枣树接成大枣树，共接了二百一十八株。秋季又在荒山上植核桃树三千棵。植树造林在小冶陶村已形成了一种风气。现在他们正在进一步学习米邱林，研究用人工受粉法改良果树，和果树的安全过冬等问题。
    一九五零年武安县人民政府把任清美领导群众学习米邱林的事迹制成幻灯片到处放映，并明确指出：向米邱林学习，发展果树园艺，植树造林，是发展山区生产的方向。于是，任清美的模范事迹很快地传遍了全县各村。大家都说：“任清美学习米邱林，咱们要学习任清美。”在任清美的影响下，一九五一年武安全县开展了轰轰烈烈的植树造林运动，共植树四十五万八千株，建立果园八十处，培植大白杨三十五亩。
    除了植树造林以外，任清美又领导群众饲养牲畜、改良牛种，使全村农民逐渐走向更加富裕的道路。
    一九五一年春天，任清美从邯郸专区参加劳动模范会议回来，就计划着把村里的牛种改良一下。他想：河南漯河牛吃的少，繁殖的快，耕地、驮东西，能顶个骡子，对山区发展生产有很大好处；本地的牛种不好，长的小，走的也慢。于是他就下决心改良牛种。他用郭永振一头母牛三年繁殖了两头小牛的实例向群众进行宣传，启发农民的买牛兴趣。大家都说：“这是一件好事。”但是，一九五零年遭受了严重雹灾的小冶陶，大部农户没有余粮，那来的资金买牛呢？任清美和党的支部研究了这种情况，认为不能因为困难动摇了买牛的信心，便提出了“把死财物变成活资金”的口号，号召农民集中游资，发展牧畜。在任清美的耐心说服动员下，家家都算了家庭账，互助组都订了买牛计划，男女老少积极投资，并且实行了互助互济。有的向亲友借了钱；有的变卖了金银首饰。他们说：“放着这些死财物没有一点用，买成黄牛就能耕地。”有的准备出去打短工和搞副业生产，赚钱买牛。就这样，有六十六户共集中了一千三百万元的游资，订出买五十八头母牛的计划。任清美又到县里贷了一部分款，亲自到漯河买回四十一头母牛。这些牛已经生小牛了。农民看到漯河牛拉、驮、走路都顶个骡子，非常高兴，又订出了再买五十头的计划。七十六岁的老汉任兴银说：“我活了一辈子，只见过买羊成群，没见过买牛成群。在共产党的领导下，什么事情都不一样了。”此外，他们还要多多繁殖羊群，还要做到每家喂一只猪，每人养一只鸡。附近十八个村的农民在任清美的影响下，都订出了改良牛种的计划。他们说：“跟着共产党走，学习任清美，就能找到山区长期建设的路。”
