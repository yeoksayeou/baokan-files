    Thoughts
    Stalin Prize Winner Ding Yi
    I grew up in the revolutionary army. Under the cultivation and education of the Party and the revolutionary army, I gradually became someone with a little bit of use. Today, I am able to receive the Stalin Prize, to receive this honor, and I wholeheartedly thank the Party and the revolutionary army for their education.
    The great Soviet people and the leader of the people of the world, Stalin, deeply cares for the people of the whole world, and encourages us to bravely advance. I wholeheartedly thank this great country and great leader.
    The people of our motherland, under the leadership of the Party, have carried out a vigorous and heroic struggle, writing countless moving epics. The work I have done only reflects one ten-millionth of this extremely rich reality. The glory I receive today should be attributed to the people of the motherland, to the Party, and to our leader Chairman Mao. The script of "The White-Haired Girl" was produced after the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and is a product under the leadership of Chairman Mao's correct literary and artistic thought. Without this correct ideological leadership, there could be no "White-Haired Girl."
    "The White-Haired Girl" is a collective creation of the people. The oppressed peasants used their anti-feudal enthusiasm to forge this beautiful story. Comrades Zhou Yang and Zhang Geng personally led the creation of this script. Many writers and playwrights participated in the discussion of this script, and many workers, peasants, and soldiers put forward suggestions for revision. Comrade He Jingzhi did most of the writing work. The glory obtained by this work should be attributed to all the broad masses and writers who participated in this creative work.
    From my own point of view, neither my own cultivation nor my work ability is commensurate with this great honor. This honor is both an encouragement and a spur to me, so that I will work harder and study harder in my future work and study, improve myself, and better serve the people.

    感想
    斯大林奖金获得者  丁毅
    我是在革命部队里长大的。在党和革命部队的培养教育下，逐渐地成为一个有一点用处的人。今天，我能得到斯大林奖金，能得到这光荣，我衷心地感谢党和革命部队给我的教养。
    伟大的苏联人民和世界人民的领袖斯大林深深地关怀着全世界的人民，鼓励我们勇敢前进。我衷心地感谢这伟大的国家和伟大的领袖。
    我们祖国的人民，在党的领导下进行了轰轰烈烈的斗争，写下了无数可歌可泣的史诗。我所做的工作仅只是把这极其丰富的现实反映了千万分之一。今天得到的光荣，应归于祖国的人民，归于党，归于我们的领袖毛主席。“白毛女”的剧本是产生于毛主席的光辉的论著“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表之后，是毛主席的正确的文艺思想领导之下的产物。没有这正确的思想领导，就不可能有“白毛女”。
    “白毛女”是人民的集体创造。受压迫的农民用他们反封建的热情铸成了这美丽的故事。周扬、张庚同志亲自领导了这一剧本的创作。许多作家、戏剧家参加了这一剧本的讨论，许多工人、农民、士兵提出了修改的意见。在执笔的工作上，贺敬之同志做了大部分的工作。这一作品所得到的光荣应归于所有的参加这一创作工作的广大群众和作家们。
    从我自己来说，无论是自己的修养或工作能力，都跟这重大的光荣不相称的。这光荣对我是鼓励也是鞭策，使我在今后的工作学习中更加努力，提高自己，更好地为人民工作。
