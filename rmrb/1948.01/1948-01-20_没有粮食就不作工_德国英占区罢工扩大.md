    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th—Reports from various sources: Anti-hunger strikes in British-occupied Germany continue to expand. Following the strike of 12,000 dockworkers in Hamburg, another 2,700 workers from Germany's largest shipyard, under the leadership of the strike committee, joined the strike on the 7th. The number of striking workers in the Ruhr area has surged to over 100,000. In Solingen, in that area, 35,000 workers held a 40-hour strike on the 8th and staged a grand anti-hunger demonstration. In Essen, 60,000 workers also held an anti-hunger strike on the 9th to support the strikers in Solingen. Nearly 10,000 workers in towns such as Hagen and Oberhausen have joined the strike. The Deputy Chairman of the German Communist Party in the British-occupied zone, Beschuko, at a meeting of 1,600 German Communist Party activists in North Rhine-Westphalia, called on workers to fight under the slogan "No Food, No Work." According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 10th, anti-hunger strikes in Germany have spread to the American-occupied zone, with streetcar workers in Munich having already gone on strike.
