Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui Telegram: The anti-"Keli Kong" movement in the Jin Sui Daily and Xinhua General Branch has recently continued to advance due to the discovery of the problem of the accumulation of an important land reform communication, "Poor Peasant Bachelor Zhang Hongnu Saved from Suicide." The manuscript reported that in the land reform in Huashuta Village, Baode, landlords and rich peasants spread rumors and slanders,污蔑张红奴不好好过光景 (defaming that Zhang Hongnu did not have a good life). When village cadres distributed disaster relief grain, they did not investigate and research, and did not allocate any to Zhang Hongnu. Middle peasants echoed the criticism, causing Zhang to become angry and attempt suicide by poisoning. Fortunately, the masses discovered it, and he was saved from death. The original manuscript was sent to the Communications Section of the General Branch in mid-August and forwarded to the Supplement Department of the newspaper, but it has been accumulated until now. In September, the author personally went to the newspaper to inquire, but the Communications Section requested the manuscript from the Supplement Department and did not receive it, and even deceived the author by saying "it was not received." Later, because other comrades also criticized the problem of accumulating manuscripts, the manuscript was unearthed. For this reason, the Jin Sui Daily published a commentary entitled "Further Develop the Anti-'Keli Kong' Movement," emphasizing: "Especially in September, which was the period when we focused on reviewing leadership and internal affairs, this matter was overlooked. This shows how un-thorough our inspection of 'Keli Kong' is, and it fully exposes how serious the problems are in our work's stance and style." The commentary finally pointed out: After September 18, the anti-"Keli Kong" movement of the newspaper and the General Branch naturally merged with the "investigation of class, investigation of stance, and investigation of thought." While this movement has just begun to deepen, it has already proven that only in this way can problems be better discovered, and can one move from unconsciousness to consciousness, from the consciousness of a few to the consciousness of the majority. Without the consciousness of the majority, the anti-"Keli Kong" cannot be thoroughly carried out. The supplement editor, Hu Zheng, wrote a self-criticism stating that the manuscript was suppressed because: "I did not attach great importance to every manuscript about land reform from the standpoint of poor and hired peasants, and I did not treat everything that poor and hired peasants encountered as if I had encountered it myself. I did not regard the Party newspaper as the mouthpiece of the poor and hired peasants, speaking up and supporting the poor and hired peasants." Chen Channing of the Communications Section also wrote a self-criticism saying: "This is because I was afraid of self-criticism, afraid of openly admitting mistakes to the author, and lacked the courage to do so. Therefore, I did not hesitate to use deception to cover up mistakes, forgetting the responsibility that a Party newspaper worker should have towards the author."

### 晋绥日报继续检查“客里空”　反对积压土地改革稿件

　　晋绥日报继续检查“客里空”
  　反对积压土地改革稿件
    【新华社晋绥电】此间晋绥日报、新华总分社反“客里空”运动，最近由于发现重要土地改革通讯“贫农单身汉张红奴服毒得救”一稿被积压之问题而继续推进。该稿系报导保德化树塔村土地改革中，地主富农造谣挑拨，污蔑贫农张红奴不好好过光景，村干部于分救灾粮时，未调查研究，送不分给张红奴，中农又随声附和批评，致张气愤服毒，幸为群众发觉，始免于死。原稿自八月中旬寄到总分社通讯科转交报社副刊部后，即被积压至今。九月间作者曾亲自到报社探讯，但通讯科向副刊部索稿未获，竟以“没有收到”予以哄骗。后因其他同志亦对压稿问题提出批评，该稿始被发掘出来。为此晋绥日报特以“再深入开展反‘客里空’运动”为题发表评论，着重指出：“特别是九月，正是我们着重检讨领导和内勤的时期，然而这件事竟被漏过，这说明我们对‘客里空’的检查是何等的不深入，这充分暴露了我们工作中的立场与作风，存在的问题是何等严重”。评论最后指出：九月十八日以后，报社、总分社的反“客里空”运动，自然而然地和“查阶级、查立场、查思想”融合起来了。还在这一运动刚刚开始深入中，已经证明只有这样才能更好的发现问题，才能从不自觉到自觉，从少数人的自觉到大多数人的自觉。如果没有大多数人的自觉，反“客里空”是反不能彻底的。副刊编辑胡正为文检讨该稿被压称：“自己不是以贫雇农的立场，十分重视关于土改的每一稿件，没有把贫雇农所遭遇到的一切就象自己所遭遇的一样，不是把党报当做贫雇农的喉舌，为贫雇农说话撑腰。”通讯科陈蝉鸣亦为文检讨说：“这是害怕自我批评，害怕对作者公开的承认错误，缺乏勇气，因此不惜用欺骗手段来掩盖错误，忘记了一个党报工作者对作者应负的责任。”
