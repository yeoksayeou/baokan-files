　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Battle situation for the week from January 1st to 7th:

　　East China Battlefield: After the Central China People's Liberation Army annihilated 9,000 enemies in the southern front at the beginning of last month, the Chiang bandit forces panicked and pieced together five or six regiments, about 17,000 men, led by Wang Yan, commander of the reorganized 51st Division, to rush to the southern front for rescue. After failing to find our forces in Dongtai, Rugao and other places, they invaded north along the Tongyu Highway on December 26th and advanced to the south of Yeting City, where they were immediately surrounded and attacked by our forces. After four days and nights of fierce fighting, the battle ended on the night of the 29th, annihilating more than 7,000 Chiang bandit troops, only half a month after the victory on the southern front. This victory in Yeting marks the "Central China People's Liberation Army's victorious opening of the prelude to a major counter-offensive," and "after this campaign, the Central China People's Liberation Army has completely grasped the initiative" (Xinhua Daily Central China Edition editorial). Therefore, it has laid a solid foundation for greater victories this year, recovering all lost territories in Central China, and more powerfully coordinating the counter-offensive of the various armies on the southern front.

　　The Huaibei Liberated Area, which is closely linked to the Northern Jiangsu and Central Jiangsu Liberated Areas, was almost entirely lost at the end of the year before last. However, after nearly a year of arduous struggle by the Huaibei people's armed forces, and after experiencing countless severe tests, breaking the Chiang bandit and puppet army Sun Liangcheng's several "pursuits" and "encirclements," they not only established a firm foothold but also recovered vast lost territories. Currently, the vast rural areas east of the Jinpu Railway, west of the Grand Canal, and south of the Hai (zhou) Zheng (zhou) Highway, covering more than 10,000 square kilometers, are controlled by the democratic government.

　　In the Laiyang area of Jiaodong: The People's Liberation Army completely defeated the Chiang bandit's eight brigades that re-invaded Laiyang. From December 14th to the end of the month, they annihilated more than 4,600 enemy troops. After the Chiang bandit forces invading Laiyang were repeatedly blocked by our forces for a long time, they crawled to the Taoyuanzhuang line, 18 miles southwest of Laiyang, on the 23rd of last month. However, our army had already preemptively inserted itself into the flanks and rear of the Chiang bandit forces, cutting off their traffic between Lingshan and Shuigoutou. At this point, the entire line of the Chiang bandit forces was shaken, and they turned around and fled south on the 26th amidst heavy snow, collapsing for dozens of miles, giving us a good opportunity to pursue and annihilate the enemy. Including the failure of the Chiang bandit reinforcements to Laiyang at the beginning of last month, the total losses before and after have reached more than 8,100, while Laiyang City is still in the hands of the people. The Chiang bandit Central News Agency's daily boasting of occupying Laiyang and the "meeting" with the defending troops is just to cover up its failure.

　　Southern Front New Area: Since the three major liberated areas have been connected, the three-way People's Liberation Army has continuously achieved victories through coordinated operations. After the major victory of the SuLuYuWan and YuShaan'e People's Liberation Army in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, they cooperated and annihilated the Fifth Army Corps Command and the Reorganized 3rd Division of the enemy south of Xiping, annihilating nearly 10,000 enemy troops. Taking advantage of the victory, they went south and surrounded the Chiang bandit Reorganized 20th Division, which was transferred north from the Dabie Mountains as reinforcements, in the suburbs of Queshan City on the evening of December 29th. After two days of fierce fighting, they annihilated two battalions of the division in the Sanlidian area north of the city, and successively killed and wounded more than 2,000 Chiang bandit troops defending the city. The Chiang bandit forces were deeply afraid that Queshan would be lost and hurriedly drew troops from the Dabie Mountains to reinforce Queshan, such as the Reorganized 9th Division, Reorganized 10th Division, and Reorganized 11th Division, further demonstrating the enemy's predicament in the Central Plains battlefield of robbing Peter to pay Paul.

　　The military and civilians of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Liberated Area have successfully smashed the Chiang bandit's "mopping up" of the Dabie Mountains by gathering 33 brigades, and have opened up vast territories in the Tongbai and Jianghan military regions. In the past 20 days, the military and civilians in the area have successively annihilated 2,000 enemy troops, captured 11 county towns, and cooperated with the SuLuYuWan and YuShaan'e two major brother units to continue expanding the results of the battle. In the past ten days, they have also recovered the county towns of Qianshan, Jingfu, Huangmei, and Lishan in the Dabie Mountains, and continued to shake the rear of the Chiang bandit forces along both banks of the Hanshui River, successively capturing more than 40 towns such as Mianyang, and annihilating more than 1,900 enemy troops. The Chiang bandit's boasted "mopping up" of the Dabie Mountains has not only become a bubble, but the anti-"mopping up" battle in the past month has further proved that the newly liberated peasants in the Dabie Mountains have close ties with the People's Liberation Army and have strengthened their struggle against the enemy in the land reform movement, so that the enemy, once entering the mountains, is like a blind man groping for fish, suffering blows from our army everywhere. The development of this situation guarantees that the Dabie Mountains will forever belong to the people.

　　In order to cooperate with the offensive on the southern front, a part of the SuLuYuWan People's Liberation Army captured Dongming County, the southernmost county in Hebei Province, on December 30th, completely annihilating the defending enemy and capturing Ding Shuben, the Commissioner of the 14th Special Administrative Region of Hebei Province and Lieutenant General Commander of the Security Forces. The JiLuYu Local Corps also annihilated more than 1,300 enemy troops on the north bank of the Wen River and recovered Dongping County.

　　Northeast Battlefield: The Northeast People's Liberation Army's winter offensive operation continues to unfold. In the week from December 29th to January 4th, it successively captured the three cities of Beipiao, Heishan, and Tai'an in the eastern Rehe and western Liaoning areas, cutting off the Beining Line between Xinmin and Jinzhou, and capturing Dahushan, an important railway junction on the line. The defending enemy of Beipiao, the temporarily organized 20th Division of the 93rd Army, fled in advance. Our troops tracked and pursued them, annihilating most of them in the Sanjiazi area on the Bei (piao) Fu (xin) Highway, capturing more than 1,000 enemy officers and soldiers, and killing and wounding more than 400. Since then, we have successively recovered 10 county towns in the winter offensive. The great victory of the Northeast People's Liberation Army (Democratic Allied Army) in annihilating more than 280,000 enemy troops and capturing 65 cities in the past year of last year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a special telegram to congratulate and encourage them to strive for the complete liberation of the Northeast.

### 一周综合战况

　　一周综合战况
    【新华社陕北七日电】一月一日至七日一周战况：
    华东战场：华中人民解放军自上月初在南线歼敌九千之后，蒋匪惊惶失措拼凑了五六个团约一万七千余人兵力，由整五十一师师长王严率领，赶往南线救援，先后在东台、如皋等地扑空，十二月二十六日又沿通榆公路北犯，进至叶挺城南，即遭我包围合击，经四昼夜激战，到二十九日夜战斗结束，歼灭蒋匪七千余人，距南线大捷时仅半月。叶南这一胜利标志着“华中人民解放军胜利揭开大举反攻序幕”，“经此战役后，华中人民解放军已完全掌握了主动”（新华日报华中版社论语）。因此它已为今年更大的胜利，收复华中一切失地，以及更有力配合南线各路大军的反攻奠定了坚实的基础。
    与苏北苏中解放区紧密相联的淮北解放区在前年年底几是全部沦陷，但经淮北人民武装将近一年的艰苦奋斗，经历了无数次严重考验，打破了蒋匪及伪军孙良诚等部的几次“追剿”“围剿”，不仅扎稳了根，而且收复了广大失地，目前津浦路东，运河以西，海（州）郑（州）公路以南，共万余方公里的广大农村已为民主政权所控制。
    在胶东莱阳地区：解放军完全击溃再犯莱阳的蒋匪八个旅，自十二月十四日迄月底止，再歼敌四千六百余人。进犯莱阳的蒋匪在长期受我节节阻击之后，上月二十三日爬行到距莱阳西南十八里之桃园庄一线，而我军已先机插入蒋匪侧后，截断其灵山至水沟头的交通，蒋匪至此全线震动，乃于二十六日扭头南窜，在大风雪中一溃数十里，给我追踪歼敌的良机。连上月初旬蒋匪增援莱阳不成，损兵折将合计在内，前后损失已达八千一百余名，而莱阳城至今仍在人民手里，蒋匪中央社连日大吹占领莱阳，与守军“会师”等，只不过是为其失败遮羞而已。
    南线新区：自从三大解放区连成一片以后，三路解放军协同作战不断取得胜利。苏鲁豫皖与豫陕鄂解放军于平汉南段大捷后，协同作战，一举歼敌第五兵团司令部及整三师于西平之南，歼敌近万，并乘胜南下，十二月二十九日晚又将由大别山区北调增援的蒋匪整二十师包围于确山城郊，经二日激战，歼灭该师二个营于城北之三里店地区，并先后毙伤守城蒋匪二千余人，蒋匪深恐确山不保，仓皇从大别山区抽调整九师、整十师、整十一师等部增援确山，愈益显示中原战场敌人挖肉补疮招架为难的困境。
    鄂豫皖解放区军民已胜利粉碎了蒋匪纠集卅三个旅对大别山区的“扫荡”，并开拓了桐柏、江汉两军区广大土地。二十余日来该区军民先后歼敌二千，攻克县城十一座，并配合苏鲁豫皖、豫陕鄂两大兄弟部队作战，继续扩张战果。最近十日间又收复了大别山区潜山、经扶、黄梅、礼山等县城，并在汉水沿河两岸继续震撼蒋匪后方，连克沔阳等城镇四十余处，歼敌一千九百余名。蒋匪所吹嘘的大别山区“扫荡”不仅成为泡影，而一月来的反“扫荡”战斗却进一步证明了大别山区新翻身农民，已与解放军有着密切联系，并在土地改革运动中加强了对敌斗争，以致敌一进入山区即如瞎子摸鱼，处处受我军打击，这一情势的发展，保证大别山区将永属人民所有。
    为配合南线攻势，苏鲁豫皖解放军一部于十二月三十日一举攻克河北省最南端的东明县城，全歼守敌并活捉蒋伪河北省十四专署专员兼中将保安司令丁树本。冀鲁豫地方兵团亦于汶河北岸歼敌一千三百余名，收复东平县城。
    东北战场：东北人民解放军冬季攻势作战继续展开，于上月二十九日至本月四日一周间又于热东辽西地区连克北票、黑山、台安三城，斩断新民至锦州间之北宁线，攻克该线上重要铁路联结点打虎山。北票守敌九十三军暂二十师一个团事先逃窜，我跟踪追击将其大部歼灭于北（票）阜（新）公路上三家子一带，俘匪官兵一千余名，毙伤四百余名。自此冬季攻势中我先后收复县城已达十座。去年一年内东北人民解放军（民主联军）歼敌二十八万余人，克城六十五座的伟大胜利，中共中央特电致贺并勉为完全解放东北而奋斗。
