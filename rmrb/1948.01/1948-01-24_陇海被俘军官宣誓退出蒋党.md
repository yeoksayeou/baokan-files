(Ji Lu Yu News) Chen Zhou, Lieutenant Colonel and Deputy Commander of the First Detachment of the Jiangsu Security Corps of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, Rui Xun, Lieutenant Colonel Instructor, and Liu Huang, Major Battalion Commander of the 278th Regiment of the 139th Brigade of the 70th Division, Li Pinghua, Deputy Battalion Commander, and more than fifty other officers who were liberated in the battle to destroy the Longhai Railway, after studying in our liberated area for several months and recognizing the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in betraying the country and opposing the people, voluntarily proposed to withdraw from the Kuomintang and the Three People's Principles Youth League. They held a solemn oath-taking ceremony to withdraw from the Kuomintang party on the 30th of last month and issued a declaration of withdrawal from the party. The declaration severely condemned the Kuomintang for being consistently used by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and becoming a tool against the people. Therefore, they solemnly declared, "We are no longer willing to be used by the counter-revolutionary clique, and we are determined to withdraw from the Kuomintang and the Three People's Principles Youth League," and proclaimed, "We must be determined to serve the people and make up for our past sins."
