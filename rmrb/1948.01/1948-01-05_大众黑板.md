Attention all villagers! We now have even better ways to equally distribute land! After the Chinese Communist Party's Land Law Outline was published, our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region issued another order, requiring all military personnel to support the Land Law Outline. If local bad elements try to sabotage or resist the equal distribution of land, the military personnel must support us and take charge, and cannot ignore it. Landlords and rich peasants in the military must be of one mind with us, the hired and poor peasants. They must not protect their families, and even more so, they must not come up with bad ideas for their families. No one in the military, whether soldiers or officers, can buy cheaply or seize the fruits of our peasants' struggle. When we distribute land equally, we must establish our own poor peasant leagues, peasant associations, and peasant representative conferences. Once we have held meetings and made decisions, the officers and soldiers in the military who come to the village must act according to our decisions and absolutely cannot sabotage them. The order also states: If the officers and soldiers in the military do not act according to the above, our peasant organizations and the government can tie them up and send them to the military for legal punishment.

In the past, the military in our border region fought and shed blood to defend the land and property we were allocated. They were sincerely working for us. However, there were also a small number of people, some of whom were from landlord and rich peasant families, some of whom were married to landlord's daughters, and some of whom were landlords and rich peasants who had infiltrated. They relied on their guns to protect the landlords, acting as "air raid shelters," and sabotaged our liberation. With this order, we have a way to deal with it. In the future, if we encounter such situations again, we can act according to the order. If they do not listen, we can hand them over to the responsible military organs for legal punishment.

    全村农民注意！咱们今后平分土地，更有办法了！中国共产党的土地法大纲发表后，咱们晋冀鲁豫军区又下了一道命令，叫所有军队人员，都要拥护土地法大纲。地方坏蛋们谁要破坏或者抵抗平分土地，军队里的人就要给咱们撑腰作主，不能不管。军队里地主富农成份的人都得和咱们雇贫农民一条心，不能包庇家，更不能给家里出坏主意。军队里不论当兵的当官的，谁也不能贱买霸占咱们农民的斗争果实。咱们平分土地，要成立自己的贫农团、农会、农代会。咱们开了会作了决定，军队里的当官和当兵的到了村里都要按咱们的决定办事，绝对不能破坏。命令中还说：军队里的官兵，如果不按以上所说的话办事，咱们农民团体和政府可以把他捆起来，送给军队按法处罚他。
    过去咱们边区的军队，为保卫咱们分到的土地财产打仗流血，他们是真心为咱们办事的。但也有一少部分人，他们有些是地主富农出身的人，有些是和地主女儿结了婚的，有些就是地主富农混进来的，他们依仗自己有枪，便包庇地主，当“防空洞”，破坏了咱们翻身。有了这条命令，咱们就有办法了，以后再遇这类事情，咱们就可以按照命令所说的办事，他们不听从，就可以送交军队负责机关依法惩办。
