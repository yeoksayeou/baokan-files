　　【Taiyue News】Wang Yongzhang, a hired peasant in Cuicun, Fushan, said, "Farming is not as good as being a hired hand. After farming for two years, I lost nine *shi* of grain (the remaining wages in rice from when he and his brother were hired hands in the past)." This sentence reveals that his village misused labor tickets, harming the poor. It turns out that Wang Yongzhang did not stand up during the land reform, and now he only farms 18 *mu* of bad land that others didn't want, and lives in a dilapidated cave propped up by pillars. In the summer, he harvested three *shi* and five *dou* of wheat, but because he had broken his leg from herding sheep for the old rich man since he was a child and was unable to perform corvée labor, he was still assigned eight *fen* when labor tickets were distributed to families. Therefore, in addition to his own labor offsetting some corvée, he also paid one *shi* and nine *sheng* of wheat for corvée labor during the months of June, July, and August. In the autumn, he harvested five *shi* of coarse grains. Although the village cadres reduced his land assignment to five *fen*, he still had to pay eight *dou* of rice and three *dou* of corn for corvée labor during the four months of August, September, October, and November, and also one *dou* of teacher's fund grain. When Village Deputy Dong Huaiyu's donkey died, Village Head Li Zengji ordered everyone in the *lu* to "work together for one person," and Wang Yongzhang had to pay another *dou*. As a result, he spent almost all of his remaining grain. However, the landlords in the village were doing very well, farming good land and evading corvée labor. Some landlords took advantage of the loopholes in the organs' production. The landlord Li De lent himself to "Dashengxin" to sell livestock, put on the five-pocket organ uniform, flaunted his former airs, and his family was even treated as dependents of cadres, and he was issued 730 *fen* of preferential treatment tickets. Targets of struggle such as Yang Shengzhi, Bai Jinlong, and Tang Jilin also took the opportunity to exploit the loopholes in the armed forces committee cooperative, avoiding corvée labor. Some military dependents who were capable and had labor power were still given preferential treatment. For example, the well-to-do middle peasant Guo Jinfeng's two households had labor power but still received 1355 *fen* of preferential treatment tickets. Wang Yongzhang used more than two *shi* of grain to subsidize these people. Therefore, some people said, "Isn't this taking the road of the old rich?"

　　崔村战勤工作没搞好
  　贫雇得替地主支差
    【太岳消息】浮山崔村雇农王永章说：“种地不如当长工，种了二年地，赔了九石粮（过去他兄弟二人当长工时剩下的工资米）”。这句话说破了他村错用工票，害了穷人。原来王永章在土地改革中没翻身，如今还只种了人家不要的十八亩烂地，住的是一孔支着柱子的烂窑。夏天打了三石五斗麦子，因为自己从小给老财放羊，把腿摔坏了，不能支差，在使用工票家庭分时，仍给他定了八分，因此六、七、八三个月除自己劳动顶支差工外，又出了差麦一石零九升。秋地打了粗粮五石，虽然村干部给他把地分下到五分，可是光八、九、十、十一四个月又出了差米八斗，玉茭三斗，还出了教员基金粮一斗。村副董怀玉死了个驴，闾长李增祭命令全闾人要“大家为一人”，王永章又出了一斗。因此把所剩下的粮都贴出来吃了个差不多。但是村里的地主们很吃得开，种着好地，又躲着不支差；更有些地主钻机关生产的空子，地主李德借给“大胜新”贩卖牲口，穿上五个口袋的机关制服，摆着他从前的架子，家里还当干属优待，发给他七百卅分优待票。斗争对象杨生智、柏金龙、唐基林等也乘机钻了武委会合作社的空子，躲着不支差。另有些能行的军属，又有劳力，还叫优待。如富裕中农郭金风两户有劳力，还领了优待票一三五五分。王永章两次贴了两石多粮食，就贴在这些人身上。所以有人说：“这还不是走了老财的道路”。
