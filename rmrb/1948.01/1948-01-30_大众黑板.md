　　People's Blackboard
　　In the past year, our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region accomplished two major tasks: one was fighting the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, and the other was land reform. Women participated in both of these tasks, and their role was not small. In fighting Chiang Kai-shek, although women could not carry guns to the front, they did important things in the rear, such as making military shoes, grinding rice and flour, and carrying stretchers. It would also be difficult to carry out the struggle against landlords without women. This is because women account for half of the peasant population in the entire border region, and they were greatly oppressed in the past. The Central Bureau's land conference clearly stipulated that women should also be emancipated when land is equally distributed in the future. In the past, when organizing women, we only paid attention to those who were clever, eloquent, and good at speaking, which resulted in landlords' and rich peasants' wives becoming leaders. This time, we must change the method and first organize poor women. Women should also participate in the poor peasant leagues. After the poor women are organized, they should unite with the middle peasant women and participate in the peasant association. The peasant association should set up a women's department. Women should also participate in land distribution. Women should not only receive land like men but also be able to express their opinions.

    去年一年，咱们晋冀鲁豫边区做了两件大事——一个是打贼老蒋，一个是土地改革。这两件事，妇女都参加了，作用起的还不小。打老蒋，妇女虽然不能扛枪上前方，但在后方做军鞋、推米面、抬担架都顶了大事。和地主闹斗争，离开妇女事情也办不好。因为，妇女占了全边区农民人口的一半，过去很受压迫，这次中央局土地会议规定得明白：将来平分土地的时候，让妇女也同样要翻身。过去组织妇女，只注意生的灵巧的能说会道的，结果是地主富农妇女当了领头人，这次要把办法改变一下，要先组织贫苦妇女。贫农团里，妇女也要参加，贫苦妇女团拢好后，要团结中农妇女，参加农会，农会里要设妇女部。分地的时候，妇女也要参加，妇女不只要和男人一样分地，而且可以发表意见。
