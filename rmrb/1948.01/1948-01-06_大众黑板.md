    Fellow farmers, brothers, and sisters of the entire village, isn't it the Gregorian New Year right now? Our troops have won great victories, sending New Year's greetings to Chairman Mao and to us! Let's start with our Border Region soldiers. Speaking from the west, we captured Yuncheng in Shanxi, wiping out over 10,000 of Hu Zongnan's troops. In the area where Henan and Hebei meet, we captured the county towns of Kaocheng and Dongming, and captured the big bandit leader Ding Shuben alive. In southwestern Shandong, we captured the county town of Dongping. The entire area of Ji, Lu, and Yu is now connected into one piece. Looking south, in Henan, we captured Shangshui County and Zhoujiakou. Further south, our three armies of Commander Liu, General Chen Geng, and Army Commander Chen Yi joined forces, greatly disrupted the Pinghan and Longhai Railways, captured Qianshan County in Anhui and Mianyang County in Hubei, reaching the banks of the Yangtze River, not far from Wuchang. Other liberated areas also won great victories. South of Yancheng in Jiangsu, our troops have also begun a counter-offensive, wiping out over 7,000 enemy troops in one fell swoop. In Shandong, Lao Jiang wanted to recapture Laiyang City, but eight of his brigades were smashed to pieces by us, wiping out over 4,000. In the Northeast, our troops under General Lin Biao captured seven county towns in a row in ten days, wiping out more than 20,000 enemies, and have now surrounded Shenyang.
