　　Military Industry Department Workers Volunteer Labor, Increasing Shell Production by 1,400 in One Month
　　Taihang Factories and Mines Compete to Increase Production
　　Fengmin Textile Factory Invents Cloth Pressing Machine
　　[This newspaper's report] Under the slogans of "Down with Chiang Kai-shek" and "Strive for New Victories in 1948," all the workers of the Military Region's Military Industry Department factories launched a fervent voluntary labor movement. The original plan was for each person to increase their voluntary labor by four workdays in January, producing an additional 1,000 shells, worth 30 million Jicha banknotes. However, based on the actual achievements of each individual, it is estimated that a total of 1,400 additional shells can be manufactured, worth 35 million Jicha banknotes.
　　[Taihang News] Workers in many factories and mines in the Taihang Second and Third Special Districts have launched a production increase competition. Under the principles of "Comprehensive Transformation" and "Comprehensive Improvement," more than 20,000 workers in the Second Special District proposed the action slogan of achieving "Three Benefits" (working hard to improve skills, achieving significant results that benefit both labor and capital, increasing production day and night to support the great counter-offensive) and achieving "Five Goods" (sufficient raw materials, large quantity, good quality, low cost, and wide sales). Workers in mines, paper mills, and textile factories in Xiangyuan's first, second, and fifth districts have formulated production increase plans and mutual inspection methods, launching a competition. Eight coal kilns in the Second District have formulated a seventy-day production increase plan, aiming to increase production by 4,400 baskets before the Lunar New Year, equivalent to 1.19 million yuan. Chen Qiying and Wang Ailian, two new female workers at the Chengguan Jianhua Textile Factory, increased their daily wool spinning output from ten liang to one jin each during the production increase movement. Each worker increased production by 11.4 jin in December. Weaving workers increased their monthly cloth output from 45 zhang to 50 zhang. The characteristic of the production increase movement in Heshun is mutual assistance between workers and peasants, with workers producing more coal and peasants providing large-scale transportation. According to recent production increase figures, it is estimated that over a hundred days, each miner can earn eight more shi of coarse grains than before. The alum production industry in the county has greatly developed this winter, increasing from fourteen workshops to thirty-eight. In the first half of the year, each workshop produced 10,000 jin of alum per month, but now it has increased to 15,000 jin. They have also created a method of using black alkali instead of grass ash for alum production, which is simple to use, highly effective, and saves raw materials. After Li Chunshou and Ma Yunshan of the Fengmin Textile Factory of the Yushe County Cooperative successfully researched and developed a cloth pressing machine, they then created a hand-pulled shuttle double machine, which can replace two machines and save one person's labor. The quantity of products exceeded 65% of the previous amount. After the coarse cloth is pressed by the cloth pressing machine, it becomes smooth and neat, and the quality is improved, immediately expanding sales. Recently, the factory extracted 19 machines and 12 apprentices to go to various villages to help develop the rural textile industry and provide technical guidance. All 146 factories and mines in Lucheng in the Third Special District have participated in the movement. The machinists of the Huafeng Iron Factory work in two shifts, day and night, starting work early and finishing late, to ensure the completion of the production plan. The workers of the × bomb plant are working hard to increase production with the lights on at both ends to complete the production plan ahead of schedule. Generally, they go to work at 4:00 AM and leave work at 5:30 PM to 6:00 PM, exceeding the ten-hour work system by one and a half to two hours every day.
