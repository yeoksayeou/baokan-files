　　"Our Lesson"
  　Speech by Wang Yuanshou, Magistrate of Pingding County
    Comrade Wang Yuanshou is from Haojia Village, Pingding First District, 45 years old this year. He was born into a poor peasant family, never went to school, is illiterate, begged for food as a child, and worked as a hired laborer for more than 30 years from the age of nine. After the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the revolution and served as a village and district cadre. Last year, he was transferred to Pingding County as a member of the County Federation of Trade Unions, and is now the Magistrate of Pingding County. He joined the Communist Party in 1929.
    After listening to this meeting, I feel liberated in my mind. The liberation of the peasants is also the liberation of me; my liberation is also the liberation of the peasants, this is my feeling. Taking myself as an example, in politics, I think this meeting represents the peasants of the entire Border Region. Today, I dare to come here to say a few words, which is a political liberation. Economically, the clothes I am wearing now are complete, without patches, and I eat my fill with rice and corn flour. I feel very happy with this current life.
    Secondly, I agree with what all the comrades talked about at the meeting. My mind is greatly opened up, and my heart is also very open. At this time, I feel that the peasants are liberated, and if the peasants are liberated, I am liberated; if the peasants are not liberated, I am not liberated. The other day, a comrade said a sentence, he said what do we take to give lessons to the peasants? What kind of lesson do we teach? Afterwards, I thought the peasants' lesson is the peasants' suffering, the peasants' stones, this is the lesson. When we go down this time, we will give the peasants lessons on the spirit we have learned, and the peasants will also give us lessons. Lesson compared to lesson is a very good lesson. This is something I personally feel, whatever suffering the peasants have is what lesson it is, this is also something I personally experienced.
    Landlords are sin, peasants are suffering. The peasants' suffering is too much to count. Hired laborers have the suffering of hired laborers, tenant farmers have the suffering of tenant farmers, those who borrow money have the suffering of borrowing money, suffering from eating bran, suffering from eating vegetables, those who load kilns have the suffering of loading kilns, those who go down kilns have the suffering of going down kilns. Shop assistants, workers, barbers, opium smokers, opera singers... like those kilns at Yangquan Station, we are all poor people, whose children are they, they are all children of poor families! His father does it, his children do it, always doing such hard work.
    There is also a kind of sin: happy things, addictive things, having food, having clothing, having a big wife, a second wife, a small wife, maids, smoking opium, drinking liquor, bullying women, who does these things? Landlords, rich peasants, local tyrants, those who eat people do these things! This is what I experienced.
    Sin is done by landlords, rich peasants, and local tyrants, suffering is suffered by the children of poor families, suffered by the fathers of poor families.
    What are we doing these years? It's called moving stones! In the past, they killed poor people and oppressed poor people. They were afraid of local tyrants and landlords, their hearts were cold, their faces were afraid, they couldn't turn over. This time, after listening to this meeting, I have already turned over, turning the world upside down! This is what I thought in my heart this time. Speaking of suffering, let me give two or three more examples: the shepherds are suffering, it rains heavily in summer, and the wind blows hard in winter, they herd a flock of sheep, and go up the mountain to herd sheep. They have no home, "soldiers don't leave the camp, horses don't leave the pen, shepherds can't leave the stinky sheep pen." When it rains heavily, or the wind blows hard, they have to be in the wild. When it hails heavily, they also have to be in the wild. At this time, what is the first thing the landlord says? "I hope my sheep haven't been hailed by the rain?! The shepherds are unreliable!" What does the shepherd's mother say? "My child is in the rain, the rain is so heavy, I hope my child hasn't been hailed!"
    When the wet nurse cooks, what does the landlord say? "The wet nurse cooks, half of her body is lost." The wet nurse cooks for others like this!
    Poor people, the suffering of working as hired laborers is endless. In the summer, people kill watermelons and drink them with white sugar, but the poor hired laborers sit in the doorway drinking water. You still have to look when drinking plain water, if the weather is early, you can drink a little more, if the weather is not early, you have to drink a little less.
    There is a budget for hired laborers eating white flour. I don't know about other places, but in Pingding, hired laborers eat five meals of white flour a year: one meal at wheat harvest, one meal on July 15th, one meal on June 6th, one meal on August 15th, and one meal when the work is finished. If you want to eat more, you have to wait for the master and his relatives to die, and eat one more meal when carrying the dead. The suffering of hired laborers is endless. This time, we have understood this spirit, and when we go down, we will move stones with the peasants. The peasants have given us lessons, and we have also given lessons to the peasants. Lesson against lesson to move the stones.

### “我们的课”　平定县长王元寿的讲话

　　“我们的课”
  　平定县长王元寿的讲话
    王元寿同志平定一区郝家庄人，今年四十五岁，出身贫农家庭，从小没念过书，不识字，小时讨过饭，从九岁起干了三十多年长工，抗战后参加革命，当过村干部、区干部，去年调到平定县当县工会委员，现在是平定县县长，二十九年参加共产党。
    这次听了这个会，我脑筋里面自己觉得解放了。解放了农民，也就解放了我；我解放了，农民也就解放了，这是我感觉的一点。拿我自己来说，在政治上，我想这个会，是代表全边区农民的，今天我敢上这里来说几句话，这是政治上的解放。在经济上，这时候我穿的衣服囫囵了，没有补绽，吃的饱子、大米、玉米面，这阵的生活我感觉很高兴。
    其次，会上大家同志谈的我都同意，脑筋炸开很大，心也放开很宽，这时我感觉农民放开了，农民放开了，我就放开了；农民放不开，我就放不开。那一天某同志谈了一句话，他说咱们下去给农民上课，拿什么上呢？上什么课呢？后头我想农民的课就是农民的苦，农民的石头，这就是课。咱们这次下去，把咱们领会的精神给农民上课，农民也给咱们上课，课比课就是很好的课。这是我亲身感觉到的一点，农民有什么苦，就是什么课，这也是我亲身体验到的一点。
    地主是罪，农民是苦。农民的苦就多了，倒不完。长工有长工的苦，租地有租地的苦，借钱有借钱的苦，吃糠苦，吃菜苦，装窑有装窑的苦，下窑有下窑的苦。当店员、当工人、剃头的、打大烟的、唱戏的……象阳泉站的那些窑上，咱都是苦人，这是谁家的孩啦，都是穷光蛋家的孩！他老子做，他孩子做，尽做这样的苦事。
    还有一种罪：高兴事、受瘾事、有吃、有穿、有大老婆、二老婆、小老婆、丫环、抽大烟、喝烧酒、欺负妇女，谁做的？地主、富农、恶霸，吃人的人做的！这是我体验到的。
    罪是地主、富农、恶霸做的，苦是穷人家孩受的，穷人家老子受的。
    咱们这几年做的叫什么呢？叫做打石头呀！过去他们杀穷人，压迫穷人。对恶霸、对地主是怕的，心里头一寒，脸面上害怕，翻不起来。这次我听了这个会，已经往起翻了，翻天着地的！这是我这回心里想的事。说苦的事情，我再举两三个例子：放羊工人苦，夏天下大雨，冬天刮大风，他们赶上一群羊，上山放羊。他没有家，“兵不离营，马不离圈，放羊的离不了臭羊圈。”下一场大雨，刮一股大风，也得在野地。下大雹，也得在野地。这时候地主头一句说什么话呢？“我那羊没有给雨泊着吧？！放羊的靠不住！”放羊的母亲说什么呢？“俺孩子在雨地，雨下的这样大，没有泊着俺孩哇！”
    奶孩做饭，地主说什么呢？“奶孩做饭。舍身一半”。奶孩做饭的就给人家做这个！
    穷人，干长工的苦就说不完。夏天人家杀西瓜和白糖喝，穷长工坐在门圪牢里喝水。喝白水还得看一看，天气早了多喝一点，天不早了就得少喝一些。
    长工吃白面有预决算，旁的地方我不知道，按平定来说，长工一年吃五顿白面：麦收一顿，七月十五一顿，六月六一顿，八月十五一顿，下工一顿，就吃这五顿白面。要想再吃，就是等主家和他的亲戚死了人，给人家抬死人的时候多吃一顿。长工的苦事是说不完的。这回我们领会了这个精神，下去给农民搬石头，农民的课给咱们上了，咱们也给农民上了课。课对课来把石头搬了。
