Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has produced an army-loving model, Zhu Zhengke, who has become a typical example for consolidating unit unity, learning, training, and combat. The characteristics of Zhu Zhengke's leadership and education methods are caring and considerate, actively helping, patiently educating, and focusing on praise. He is from Juxian County, Shandong Province, and of poor peasant origin. He has always been active in his work. In May of last year, he was transferred to the 8th squad of a certain company as squad leader. At that time, the squad was not united internally, and unhealthy tendencies prevailed. Zhu conducted investigations and research and learned that the main reason was that the deputy squad leader put on bureaucratic airs, which made the general soldiers dissatisfied, especially the veteran soldier Xu Hongfu, who had a fierce conflict with the deputy squad leader. Therefore, he took the lead in everything and did everything himself. When he discovered good things in the soldiers, he praised them in a timely manner. Soon, the soldiers reflected, "This squad leader is not bad." Later, everyone approached him. Zhu's care for Xu Hongfu was even more meticulous. He became warm with Xu in life. He said to Xu, "Whether the 8th squad can be successful depends on you. You are a veteran soldier. You look down on the deputy squad leader, and others will look down on him even more." Xu said very moved: "I must change and ensure that I get along well with the deputy squad leader." Then Zhu went to persuade the deputy squad leader. The deputy squad leader ran to serve food and water to the soldiers that day. The soldiers also pulled the deputy squad leader onto the kang. In this way, it developed, and the relationship between the eighth squad began to improve. The soldier Qian Bowen was the most mischievous and troublesome. Once, after marching only seven li, Qian lay down on the side of the road and refused to move. Zhu kindly ran to help him carry his gun, but Qian glared at him and said, "Get out of here, can't you carry seven and a half catties when you're a soldier?" When Qian was on guard duty, Zhu planned to talk to him, but Qian said, "Zhu Zhengke, stay away, I want to desert, you can't tie me down." Zhu was not angry at all, and still patiently helped and educated him, and praised Qian's slight advantages, finally making Qian change out of gratitude and become a combat hero and model squad leader. The entire eighth squad became a model squad because of his improvements. After the summer offensive last year, Zhu was promoted to platoon leader, and again used this working method to create an all-around model platoon. He was also invited by other battalions to give reports on his work experience. The squad leaders were very impressed and learned from him one after another. Now, the "Zhu Zhengke style" of leadership has become famous throughout the division, and the division and regiment have called for launching a Zhu Zhengke movement to improve company work and consolidate the troops.

　　解放军某部号召
  　学习爱兵模范朱正科
    【新华社东北二十六日电】解放军某部出现爱兵模范朱正科，成为巩固部队团结、学习、练兵、战斗的一个典型。朱正科的领导和教育方法的特点是爱护体贴，积极帮助，耐心教育，表扬为主。他是山东莒县人，雇农出身，一贯工作积极，去年五月间调某连八班当班长，当时该班内部不团结，邪气占上风，朱进行了调查研究，了解其主要原因是班附摆官僚架子，使一般战士不满意，尤其是老战士徐鸿福和班附闹得很凶，于是他自己就事事带头，亲自动手，发现战士中有好的地方，及时予以表扬。不久，战士们反映说：“这个班长还不错”，后来大家才接近他。朱对于徐鸿福的爱护，更是无微不至，生活上和徐搞热了，他对徐说：“八班能否搞好就靠你，你是老战士，你看不起班附，别人更看不起他”。徐很感动的说：“我一定要转变，保证和班附搞好”。然后朱又去说服班附，班附当天就跑去首先端饭打水给战士们，战士们也拉着班附上炕，这样，发展开了，就开始把八班的关系改善了。该班战士钱伯文最调皮捣蛋，有一次行军才走了七里，钱就歪在路旁不走，朱好意跑去帮他背枪，钱反瞪着眼说：“去你的，当得了兵背不起七斤半？”钱站岗时，朱打算和他谈谈，钱却说：“朱正科，靠远点，我要开小差，你拴也拴不住”。朱一点也不冒火，仍然耐心帮助、教育，并表扬钱的些微好处，终于使钱因感动而转变成为战斗英雄，和模范班长。整个八班由于他的改进成了模范班。去年夏季攻势后，朱被提升为排长，又以此种工作方法创造了全面模范排。他并被其他各营请去作工作经验报告，班长们都很佩服，纷纷向他学习。现“朱正科式”的领导作风已闻名全师，师团并号召展开朱正科运动，以改进连队工作，巩固部队。
