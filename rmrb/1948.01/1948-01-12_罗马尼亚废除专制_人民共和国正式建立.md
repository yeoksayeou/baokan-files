  　People's Republic Formally Established
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Bucharest dispatch: The Romanian government issued a proclamation to the people on December 30th of last year, announcing the abdication of King Michael and the formal establishment of the People's Republic. The proclamation pointed out: "The autocratic regime no longer conforms to the current conditions of our country's political life, and it seriously hinders Romania's path towards progress."

After Romania abolished autocracy and announced the republic, Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov, the French General Confederation of Labour, and youth groups from countries such as the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia all sent congratulatory telegrams. Grand rallies were held everywhere in Romania to celebrate enthusiastically. The army and civil servants unanimously swore allegiance to the People's Republic. Various circles sent telegrams to congratulate the newly formed Groza government. The General Confederation of Labour, representing the working people, telegraphed that the People's Republic has opened up a bright road for the Romanian people. The General Confederation of Labour also called on the working class of the entire country to warmly welcome Romania's declaration of a republic, because it will lead Romania onto the path of people's democratic development, consolidate national independence and lasting peace, and the working class, working peasants, and progressive intellectuals will manage the country.
