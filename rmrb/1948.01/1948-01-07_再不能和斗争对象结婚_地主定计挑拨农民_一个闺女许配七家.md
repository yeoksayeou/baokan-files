　　No More Marrying Class Enemies
    Landlord Schemes to Sow Discord Among Peasants
    One Daughter Promised to Seven Families
    [Report from this newspaper in Shahe] The great landlord Yang Shijin in Mao Village, Third District, is using his daughter (19 years old) to deliberately provoke disunity among the peasants. His method is to first betroth his daughter to the militia captain of Baitao Village (already giving engagement gifts of one zhang three chi of black cloth, seven chi of blue cloth, and other items). Then, he secretly promised her to the militia instructor of his own village, and also to two ordinary villagers in his own village. He also promised her to cadres and ordinary people in Zhao Village, Linzhuang Village, and Qi Village, a total of seven people (including three cadres, one member of the theater troupe, and three ordinary people). He tells the ordinary people: I want to marry you, but the village cadres won't allow it. They are cadres, how dare we disobey them? Then he tells the cadres: I want to marry you, but the masses are not satisfied, the masses oppose it, etc. He goes to other villages and says: I want to marry you, but my own village won't let me leave. He is deliberately provoking disunity between villages, between cadres and the masses. This matter was discovered at a meeting of cadres and poor peasants throughout the district. (Bingcai, Wanying)
    [Report from this newspaper in Cixian] Yang Quan, a resident of Xicheng Street in Cixian County, is 40 years old. He lost his wife last year, leaving behind three daughters. This spring, he married a 20-year-old woman who was a target of struggle. Because she had some education and pretended to be progressive, she was even elected as a production and emancipation committee member, leading women's production in Group ×. At first, she was particularly falsely active, not letting any of the women go home to sleep at night, but having them sleep together collectively. However, she went home every night herself. Later, after other women gave her suggestions, she then led the women to become corrupt, taking them to see operas every night. In the cotton spinning production, she sat by the stove drinking the good tea she bought herself, without even touching the spinning wheel. She didn't care about her family at all. She ignored the children when they called her "Mom." When Yang Quan discussed family matters with her, she always said that she was too busy with her work. Yang Quan did not dare to say anything. After investigation by the masses, it was found that she was a target of struggle who only knew how to enjoy herself and could not endure hardship. She was expelled from membership. Local women are now figuring out how to deal with her finally. (Liyuan)

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    There is not a single instance of a landlord's daughter being promised to a poor person where there isn't a malicious motive. Many poor people have fallen for their tricks. If they do not reform, they will not be able to live with us poor people. Our newspaper has said it long ago, and the leadership organs in various places have also instructed us, telling everyone not to invite disaster. These two news items from Shahe and Cixian prove that many people still do not understand this matter. We hope that all localities will conduct inspections based on this and carry out widespread education.

　　再不能和斗争对象结婚
    地主定计挑拨农民
    一个闺女许配七家
    【本报沙河讯】三区毛村大地主杨士进利用闺女（十九岁）有计划挑拨农民不团结，办法是把他闺女先许配白塔村民兵队长（已出订礼黑布一丈三尺、蓝布七尺及其他的东西）。后又暗地许给本村民兵指导员，同时又许给本村两个群众，还许给赵村、林庄村、綦村三村干部群众，同时共允许与七个人成婚（内有干部三个、剧团团员一个、群众三个。）他告群众说：我和你结婚吧，村干部不允许，人家是干部，咱敢违抗？返回来他又告干部说：我和你结婚吧，群众不满意，群众反对等。他到外村说：我有心和你结婚，本村不让出村。故意挑拨村与村，干部与群众的团结，此事是在全区干部和贫雇会上发现的。（炳才、万英）
    【本报磁县讯】磁县城关西城街一户民杨全，年四十岁，他去年丧妻，丢下三个女儿。今春找了一个二十岁的斗争对象女人结婚，因她有学识和假进步遮盖，竟被选为生产和翻身委员，领导第×组妇女生产。起初特别假积极，不让每一个妇女晚上回去睡觉，叫在一块集体睡，可是她每天晚上就回家了。后经别的妇女给她提出意见，她就又领导妇女腐化，每晚领着妇女看戏。在纺花生产中，她坐在火炉子边喝着她自己买的好茶叶，连纺花车摸也不摸。对于家庭更是不闻不问，小孩叫妈她不理，杨全和她商讨家中问题，她老说她的工作忙没有功夫。杨全也不敢吭。经群众审查后，查出她是个斗争对象，只知享乐不能吃苦，把她开除会籍。对她的最后处理，当地妇女正想办法。　（栗员）    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    地主女儿许配给穷人，没有一个不是心里有坏主意，好多穷人都上了他们的当。她们不转变，和咱穷人也过不到一块。咱们报上早就说过，各地领导机关也指示过，告大家不要招祸害。沙河、磁县这两条消息证明，这件事还有许多人不懂得，望各地据此做检查，并进行普遍教育才好。
