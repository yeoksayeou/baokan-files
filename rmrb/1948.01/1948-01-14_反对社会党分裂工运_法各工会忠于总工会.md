Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Paris Dispatch: The struggle of the French working class to safeguard the General Confederation of Labor is continuing to unfold. The National Committee of the Government Employees Union passed a resolution on the 8th, declaring its loyalty to the unity of the labor movement and supporting the General Confederation of Labor. Tobacco workers in Algiers recently passed a resolution unanimously supporting trade union unity, declaring their affiliation with the General Confederation of Labor, and opposing the despicable activities of the "Workers' Force" faction. Countless workers have shown their opposition to the Socialist Party's splitters by joining trade unions affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor in large numbers. In the second half of last December alone, a certain provincial trade union federation had more than a thousand new members join. According to a report in L'Humanité on the 8th, trade unions across the country are firmly loyal to the General Confederation of Labor.
