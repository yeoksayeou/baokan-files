　　[Our Newspaper Dispatches] After the news that Chiang Kai-shek completely sold out Taiwan to the United States reached the Taiwan team at the Military and Political University, the entire team held a current affairs discussion to recognize that the People's Liberation Army's all-out counter-offensive was achieving unprecedented victories, and that the Chiang gang was struggling desperately, relying more and more on its American foreign daddy, and shamelessly openly selling out Taiwan. Every trainee deeply hated Chiang Kai-shek. Wu Wu-yue, whose home is in Hsinchu County, Taiwan, said, "We have been Japanese slaves for over fifty years, and we will never be American slaves again. We must overthrow Chiang Kai-shek! If Chiang Kai-shek does not die, we will have no chance to rise!" Lai Xinzhi said, "With the Communist Party, there is Taiwan. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have the strength to fight back to Taiwan, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, drive out American imperialism, and liberate our own class parents and siblings." Shen Xucai said, "Taiwan is the Taiwan of our workers and peasants. We vow to fight back to Taiwan and liberate our poor brothers in distress!" More than one hundred people unanimously resolved to send a telegram to the whole country, denouncing Chiang Kai-shek for selling out Taiwan.

　　The telegram pointed out that Taiwan is the Taiwan of the broad masses of working people, and workers and peasants are the masters of Taiwan. No reactionary bandits are allowed to contaminate it! The telegram said: "...Since the Japanese surrendered, the Chiang gang has betrayed the country, and Taiwan has long fallen into the hands of US imperialism. Now they are even more shamelessly daring to sell out Taiwan. We, representing the broad masses of working people in Taiwan, resolutely resist! We want to be masters, we want to stand up. With the Communist Party, there is a new Taiwan. We will fight back to where we came from!" "The people of Taiwan have a glorious tradition of heroic struggle, resisting the evil rule of the Dutch and the Manchus, resisting the oppression of Japanese imperialism, and resisting the brutal rule of the Chiang Kai-shek gang in the 'February 28th' incident. Now that we have the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Communist Party, we have strong strength. We vow to fight back to Taiwan, to liberate our own class parents and siblings, to implement 'land to the tiller', and to fight to the end for the establishment of a new Taiwan!" The telegram finally called on the armed brothers of the Taiwan people's uprising and patriotic compatriots in Taiwan to widely organize armed forces, mobilize the masses, resist the brutal rule of the Chiang gang, drive out US imperialism, echo each other from north to south, fight on two fronts, and strive for the early liberation of Taiwan, the establishment of a new Taiwan, and the establishment of a new China.

　　军大一百多位台湾籍学员
  　声讨蒋贼出卖台湾
  　誓死打回老家去，解救在蒋美压榨下的穷弟兄们！
    【本报讯】蒋贼全部出卖台湾国给美的消息传到了军大台湾队后，全队召开了时事座谈会，认清解放军全面大反攻空前胜利，蒋匪垂死挣扎，更加依靠他的美国洋爸爸，竟无耻公开出卖台湾。每个学员对蒋介石痛恨入骨。家在台湾新竹县的吴武岳说：“我们当了五十多年的日本牛马，决不再当美国的奴隶，非打倒蒋介石不可！蒋贼不死，就没有我们的出头日子！”赖新枝说：“有共产党就有台湾，在共产党领导下，我们有力量打回台湾去，打倒蒋贼，赶走美帝国主义，解救自己的阶级父母兄弟。”沈徐才说：“台湾是我们工人农民的台湾，誓死打回台湾去，解救苦难中的穷弟兄们！”一百多人一致决议，通电全国，声讨蒋贼出卖台湾。
    通电中指出台湾是台湾广大劳动人民的台湾，工农是台湾的主人，不准任何反动匪贼沾污它！通电中说：“……从日本投降后蒋匪卖国，台湾早已落入美帝国主义手中。今更无耻的胆敢出卖台湾，我们代表台湾广大劳动人民坚决反抗！我们要做主人，我们要翻身，有共产党就有新台湾，我们从那里出来就打回那里去！”“台湾人民有英勇斗争的光荣传统，反抗过荷兰、满清的罪恶统治，反抗过日本帝国主义的压迫，‘二二八’事件反抗过蒋介石匪帮的残暴统治，如今我们有了共产党毛主席的领导，我们有坚强的力量，誓死打回台湾去，为解救自己的阶级父母兄弟，实行耕者有其田，为建立新台湾奋斗到底！”通电最后号召台湾民变武装弟兄及台湾爱国同胞，广泛组织武装，发动群众，反抗蒋匪残暴统治，赶走美帝国主义，南北呼应，两线作战，争取早日解放台湾，建立新台湾，建立新中国。
