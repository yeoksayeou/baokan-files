　　Jing County, Qilizhuang
  　Poor Peasants Have Never Received Fruit and Still Borrow Grain from Landlords
    [Jinan News] In Houqilizhuang, Jing County, the land reform in the seventh district was not thorough in the past. Poor peasants are still not eating enough or wearing warm clothes. They are bullied by landlords and live a life of suffering. Wen Yunrong is sixty-two years old. From the age of seventeen, he worked as a laborer until he was fifty-nine. His family of six, with an eldest daughter of fifteen, a youngest son of seven, old and young, none of whom could work. They cultivated eighteen mu of alkaline land, and the harvest was very small. Every spring, they took their children to beg for food. They did not receive any fruits during the mass movement, and this year's harvest only gave them enough to eat for the winter. In winter, the whole family only has two ragged quilts. The adults feel sorry for the children and cover them with the quilts, while the couple lies naked on the reed mat. They are so cold at night that they can't sleep, so they move two unburnt bricks to press on their bodies. The couple cries constantly in the middle of the night. They have nothing to eat at home, so they borrow grain from the local landlord, Wen. They begged him bitterly before he lent them a sheng of cattle feed. They also borrowed grain from the landlord Ye Chunhua. After saying a lot of nice things, Ye, with a scolding tone, insisted on a written document as collateral. Ma Guangqian is sixty-one years old, with a family of four and five mu of land. He came with his mother in the womb, and his father died when he was six years old. In the old society, people looked down on him. He had been starving and begging for food since he was thirty-five years old. His son is fifteen years old this year and hasn't eaten dumplings for twelve years during the New Year. Now, he is about to run out of food, and his clothes are so torn that they cannot be piled up. The family has three ragged quilts, which are hung up as a door during the day and taken down to cover themselves at night. He doesn't have his own house and lives in two dilapidated garden rooms belonging to others. In the year of the famine, because the child was crying from hunger, he held the child to beg for food in the winter of the previous year, and his hands were so frozen that he still can't hold anything. During the mass movement, the farmers' association only distributed some grain. The house that was sold to the landlord Ye Chunhua in the year of the famine was not allowed to be redeemed, and the land that was sold was not allowed to be returned. The landlord even cursed him by his childhood name, "Do you know what your surname is!" The landlord had money and power, and old Ma didn't dare to say anything. Wang Deming has a family of five with two quilts. His wife angrily said, "The words of the poor are not even worth a dog's fart. If the village cadres don't lead the way, the poor can only stare blankly." Wang Shangwen, Mo Fushun, Ma Mingqi, and Wen Yunchen are all poor peasants who have not received any fruits and live in very difficult conditions. They dare not speak in the village.

　　景县七里庄
  　贫农从没得果实如今仍借地主粮
    【冀南消息】景县七区后七里庄过去土地改革不彻底，贫农仍是吃不饱、穿不暖，受地主欺负，过着痛苦日子。闻云荣六十二岁，从十七岁扛活到五十九，全家六口人，大闺女十五岁，小儿七岁，老的老，小的小，没做活的人，种着十八亩碱地，收成很少，年年春天带着孩子去要饭。群众运动中也没分得果实，今年收的只落个冬饱。冬天全家就两床破被子，大人疼孩子给孩子盖上，两口子原身躺在炕席上，晚上冻的睡不着就搬两个坯压在身上，半夜里两口子不断的哭。家里没吃的，给当家地主闻某借粮，苦苦哀求才借给一升牛料。又向地主叶春花借粮食，说了一顿好话，叶带着骂腔非要文书作抵押不行。马光前六十一岁，全家四口人五亩地，他娘胎身带他来的，六岁时他爹死了。在旧社会里人瞧不起，卅五岁上就挨饿要饭，他小子今年十五岁，十二年过年没吃过饺子。现在眼看就断顿，衣裳破的做不成堆。一家三床破被子，白天吊上当门，晚上摘下来再盖。自己没房子，住在人家的两间破园屋里。灾荒那年因为孩子饿的光哭，头年冬里抱着孩子去要饭，把手冻的现在还不会拿东西。群众运动中，农会里光分给点粮食，灾荒年卖给地主叶春花的宅子不叫赎，卖的地不叫抽。地主还提着小名骂：“你知道姓啥吧！”地主有钱有势，老马也不敢吭声。王德明五口人，两床被子，他老婆气的说：“穷人说话还不如狗放屁哩，村干不领着干，穷人干瞪眼。”王尚文、莫福顺、马明起、闻云臣都是贫农，都没分到一点果实，生活都很困难，在村里不敢说话。
