Those who are physically strong should return to the front lines to kill the enemy and perform meritorious service for the people; those who cannot go to the front lines can participate in work in the rear; disabled veterans who have lost their ability to work and are studying in disabled veterans' training centers should learn and participate in some handicraft labor as much as possible. In accordance with instructions from higher authorities, one thousand lightly disabled veterans will be mobilized to study at the Military and Political University and then serve as training officers in various independent regiments. The resolution then stated: All disabled veterans should actively support the peasants and protect their emancipation. A widespread and in-depth movement to examine stance, examine ideology, and rectify discipline should be carried out among disabled veterans and disabled veterans' schools to thoroughly examine shortcomings and errors in their own thinking, actions, and lives, and eliminate landlord and rich peasant ideology. At the same time, all disabled veterans should abide by the laws of the government and peasant associations and must not interfere with the work of the government and peasant associations. The resolution also specifically stipulated: Carry out a meritorious service movement in disabled veterans' schools and training centers to create disabled veteran models. The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention of the Chinese People's Liberation Army should become the discipline uniformly observed by disabled veterans.
