Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 10th. Over the past month or so, the various military regions of Northeast China, while continuously conducting inspections of leadership, have set off a great upsurge in military training led by cadres and carried out automatically by soldiers, braving the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius. The Hegang Military Region held an enlarged meeting of the Party Committee last month, and sharply criticized bureaucratic and warlord styles of work. The serious error of the regiment commander of the Military Region Guard Regiment in failing to thoroughly implement instructions from higher authorities and undermining mass discipline was exposed and struggled against at the meeting, and he was dismissed from his post. The political commissar of the regiment also received a Party warning. In his summary, Deputy Political Commissar Zhang of the Military Region emphasized that military training should be closely combined with Party rectification in the future, and called on the entire army to vigorously carry out the "Five Checks" campaign of checking class, checking ideology, checking style of work, checking stand, and checking life during military training. In order to strive to complete the military training tasks ahead of schedule, a certain unit specially stipulated a "Military Training Assault Month," mobilized cadres below the company level to join the squads to train with the soldiers, directly influencing the soldiers, and humbly learning from the masses. Many companies in the Mudanjiang Military Region adopted on-site exercises with "doing and evaluating at the same time" to cultivate a high degree of enemy awareness among soldiers. The units of the Songjiang Military Region specifically formulated "Military Training Pacts" and "Individual Plans" in the companies, and carried out arduous training. Soldiers with lagging technology also quickly caught up to the level. The Nenjiang Military Region organized "Hard Training Classes" and "Special Training Groups." After reviewing the military training work a month ago, a certain unit directly under the Military Region organized a "Five Actions Movement" of "using the brain—more ideas," "using the mouth—more questions, more learning," "using the eyes—diligent aiming," "using the hands—more grenade throwing," and "using the feet—doing errands and chores oneself," creating an even more automatic and arduous training upsurge.

　　北满练兵整党结合
  　开展“五查”“五动”运动
    【新华社东北十日电】过去月余内，北满各军区在不断进行检查领导中，冒零下三十度严寒掀起干部带头与战士自动的大练兵热潮。合江军区上月举行党委会扩大会，对官僚主义、军阀主义作风，进行了尖锐的批评，军区警卫团团长不彻底执行上级指示与破坏群众纪律的严重错误，大会当展开斗争，并将其撤职，该团政委亦受到党的警告。军区张副政委在总结时，特别强调今后练兵应与整党密切结合，号召全军在练兵中大力开展查阶级、查思想、查作风、查立场、查生活五查运动。某部为争取提早完成练兵任务，特规定“练兵突击月”，动员连以下干部编入各班去和战士一起操练，直接影响战士，并虚心向群众学习。牡丹江军区许多连队采取实地演习“边作边评”，养成战士高度的敌情观念。松江军区各部连队里具体订立“练兵公约”和“个人计划”，进行苦练，技术落后的战士，亦迅速赶上水平。嫩江军区组织“硬练班”“特练组”，月前军区直属某部检讨练兵工作后，组织“动脑——多想法”“动嘴——多问，多学习”“动眼——勤瞄准”“动手——多投弹”“动脚——公差勤务自做”的“五动运动”，造成了更加自动苦练的热潮。
