　　Zuoquan Nangou Village
  　Solves the Winter Clothing Difficulties of Hired Poor
    [News from our newspaper] After the hired poor meeting on the 12th in Nangou Village, Sixth District of Zuoquan, the rich peasant and bad village chief Wang Yanzi was removed from his position, and the hired poor Cao Cunzhu was elected as the village chief. After Comrade Cunzhu took office as village chief, he cared about the difficulties of the hired poor. He and the cooperative director Cao Qizhu and other village cadres went to various affiliated villages to check the funds of the hired poor in winter production and various difficulties in getting through the winter. According to the inspection, there are four hired poor households (14 people, large and small) who have not yet put on cotton clothes. Qizhu said, "This difficulty must be resolved quickly. The cooperative will lend cotton, organize everyone to produce, and earn money to repay the cotton money." After discussion, the cooperative lent more than ten jin of cloth. Then the cadres divided the work to hold discussions in the homes of the hired poor, and planned to organize them into production teams. These fourteen hired poor people have now put on new cotton clothes. (Wei Rong)
