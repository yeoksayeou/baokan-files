　　Taihang Second Military Sub-district Guerrilla Unit
　　Once Annihilating 105 Yan Bandits
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Taihang Second Military Sub-district's Third Detachment Guerrilla Unit, penetrating deep into the enemy's heartland, launched a winter offensive against the Yan puppet troops. On December 21st, the unit raided the Chaoyang stronghold in Dong Village, ten miles north of Taigu City. After four hours of battle, the Yan puppet armed forces in both strongholds were completely annihilated. 105 were killed or captured, three machine guns, thirty-five rifles, three small cannons, over 300 rounds of ammunition, and thirty-two head of livestock were seized. The people of both villages, who had suffered decades of exploitation by the Yan puppets, saw the light of day again. (Tuofu)
　　[Reported by this newspaper, Taihang, 30th] The militia rotation teams and public security plainclothes teams of Xiuwu's Third and Fourth Districts ambushed the rubber-wheeled cart brigade of the First Station Headquarters of the Chiang bandit Zhengzhou Joint Logistics General Headquarters stationed in Jiaozuo on the highway between Jiaozuo and Xiuwu City on the 23rd. More than fifty Chiang bandits driving fifteen rubber-wheeled carts, escorted by a regular company of the 38th Division, were transporting coal from Jiaozuo to Xiuwu. Just as they reached the vicinity of Lihe Station, they were taken care of by our rotation teams. Five enemies were killed or wounded, over thirty were captured alive, and the rest were so frightened that they abandoned the coal carts and scattered in all directions. The rotation teams immediately launched a general offensive, and the Chiang bandit reinforcement security regiment that came out of Daiwang was beaten back by another guerrilla unit, capturing two enemies alive and obtaining thirty-nine mules. The Chiang bandits were so frightened that they dared not leave their tortoise shells easily again.
