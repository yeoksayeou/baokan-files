[Ji Lu Yu News] Poor peasants in Chengbei Village, Qingfeng, jointly opened a small manufacturing factory. Forty-three poor peasant households in the village, during the land reform review, cleared out broken tools for making cotton gins and a pile of scrap iron from the landlords. In the autumn, they turned this scrap iron into cash as capital. They also added shares, totaling 116,000 yuan, and opened a small factory to manufacture cotton gins, cotton bows, and repair broken cotton gins and cotton bows. They elected a manager and eight workers who knew carpentry and blacksmithing, each of whom received dividends according to their shares, plus bonuses. In addition to repairing cotton gins and cotton bows every day, they can make a new cotton bow every six days. The cost is 180,000 yuan, but they can sell it for 240,000 yuan, earning 60,000 yuan. In addition, there is a cotton gin that can earn a profit of 2,500 yuan per day. They hold democratic meetings every day to discuss, plan, and divide work, with each group competing with each other, resulting in high morale. In fifty days, after deducting the capital of 116,000 yuan and living expenses, they made a net profit of 780,000 yuan.

　　清丰城北村贫农伙开小型制造厂
    【冀鲁豫消息】清丰城北村贫农合伙开办小型制造厂，该村贫农四十三户，在土改复查时，从地主手里清算回来造轧车的破工具和一堆破铁，于是他们在秋后把这些破铁打成价，作为资本。另加入股，计共十一万六千元，开办造轧花车、弹花弓与修理破轧花车、弹花弓的小工厂。选举经理和会木匠、铁匠活的八个工人，每人按股分红，另外提奖。每天除修理轧花车、弹花弓外，每六天能造一个新弹花弓。本钱十八万元，能卖二十四万元，可赚六万元。另外还有一个轧花车，每天轧花能得利二千五百元。他们每天开民主会，讨论、计划和分工，各组间互相比赛，工作情绪很高，五十天中除十一万六千元的资本和吃用外，净赚洋七十八万元。
