Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 28th: The "Gun Poetry" movement in a certain unit of the Central China People's Liberation Army has become a new weapon in the unit's political work. After Central China began its counter-offensive in August of last year, the morale of the People's Liberation Army soared. Liu Gansheng, the political instructor of the artillery company of a certain detachment of the unit, and the company commander, imitated the Soviet army's practice of writing "Fight to Berlin" on artillery shells and tanks when they attacked Berlin. Based on the various technical advantages and disadvantages of the guns and cannons, and the requirements for them, they wrote short poems and posted them on the guns and cannons. For example, on a certain gunner's flat-shooting gun was posted: "Flat-shooting gun is very loud, hits well on Nanyang Bank (place name near Ye Ting City), everyone in the regiment and brigade knows it, this time can't be a white hit (meaning to lose face)", and another soldier's Type 82 mortar had this on it: "Type 82 cannon, your age is really not young, but your prestige is not very high, this time against the war, has been praised and welcomed by the military in various places. They have also written their own plans for meritorious service into poems and posted them on their weapons and calling it "Gun Poetry". This creation was promoted and popularized by the leadership and quickly became a widespread mass movement. The commander's flag wrote: "My flag is bright red, less casualties in combat command," and a certain company's heavy machine gun wrote: "Maxim heavy machine gun is like a dragon, it charges when fighting, if it can fight well again this time, it will make great contributions at the commendation meeting." Cook Feng Anquan's rice-washing basket read: "The rice-washing basket is not too big, not too small, it's full of rice, no more no less, it's scrubbed three or four times in the water, and the sand and mud are washed away. Comrades all say it is very hygienic, and everyone eats very full. Fight in the counter-offensive and capture more guns. If we win the battle, I will also have credit."
    After the movement was launched, the unit made significant improvements in military, political, and cultural aspects. After the Type 82 mortar was posted with a poem saying "Don't fall behind," all the soldiers in the squad worked day and night to study it carefully and finally came up with various ways to improve its effectiveness. Shen Honghai, a soldier in a certain battalion's machine gun company, posted on his rifle: "My 79 gun, polished brightly, this time I'm going to counter-attack, desperately fight old Chiang," and after that, he wiped his gun and practiced martial arts every day. In a certain battle, as soon as the attack order was issued, he jumped out of the position and shouted, "My 79 is shining brightly," and rushed towards the enemy with a burst of energy. When marching was tiring, everyone read the "Gun Poetry" of "Learn literature and martial arts and not be afraid of hardship," and immediately stepped up their pace. In the southern line offensive, the masses along the way warmly welcomed and helped, and the soldiers wrote poems to express their gratitude and determination. Yu Yuankun wrote: "Received the respect of the people, determined to eliminate the enemy, go to the battlefield in battle, serve the country, the Party, and the people."
    Based on existing experience, this "Gun Poetry" has three major benefits: First, everyone can write, and those who can't write can ask others to write for them. It can be read anytime, anywhere, absorbing the participation of the majority of commanders and fighters, breaking the narrow circle of propaganda and mobilization work limited to a few cadres and activists in the past. Moreover, the slogans of propaganda and mobilization are written according to the requirements of each person and in their own language, so they are very specific and effective. Second, the plan for meritorious service is poeticized, which is easy for the soldiers to remember, and it is very flexible. New poems can be written at any time according to new tasks, thus powerfully promoting various tasks. Third, it improves the cultural level of the soldiers. After the soldiers have compiled their own "Gun Poetry," they are very interested in reading it, looking at it, and writing it. In this way, they have memorized many new words.

### 部队政治工作新武器　华中创“枪杆诗”运动

　　部队政治工作新武器
  　华中创“枪杆诗”运动
    【新华社华东前线二十八日电】华中解放军某部的“枪杆诗”运动，已成为该部政治工作中的新式武器。去年八月华中开始转入反攻后，解放军士气高涨，该部某支队炮兵连指导员刘干声和连长，仿效苏军进攻柏林时，炮弹坦克上都写上“打到柏林去”的作法，根据各种枪炮技术上的优缺点和对它的要求，写成短诗歌贴在枪炮上。如某炮手的平射炮上贴着：“平射炮刮刮叫，南洋岸（地名在叶挺城附近）打得好，团里旅里都知道，这次不能打白掉（丢脸的意思）”，又如某战士的八二迫击炮上贴着：“八二炮，你的年龄真不小，可是你威信不很高，这次反战义，得到了各地军的赞杨和欢迎，他们纷纷把自己的立功计划也写成诗歌，贴在各人的武器上，并叫它为：“枪杆诗”。此一创造经领导上提倡推广，就迅速成为普遍的群众运动，指挥员旗子上写着：“我的旗子红通通，战斗指挥少伤亡”，某连重机枪上写着：“马克沁重机如条龙，打起仗来它冲锋，这次再能打得好，表功会上立大功”。炊事员封安全的淘米箩上写着：“淘米箩不大不小，装上米不多不少，在水里三擦四捣，把沙子泥粒淘掉。同志们都说卫生很好，大家都吃得挺饱，反攻打仗多把枪缴，打了胜仗我也有功劳。”
    运动开展后，该部在军事、政治、文化各方面均有显著提高。八二迫击炮被贴上“不要落后了”一诗后，全班战士日夜精心研究，终于想出种种办法，提高了它的效力。某营机炮连战士沈洪海在步枪上贴上：“我的七九枪，擦得亮堂堂，这次去反攻，拼命打老蒋”，以后他就天天擦枪练武，某次战斗中，出击令刚下，他就跃出阵地大喊：“我的七九亮堂堂”一股劲杀向敌人。行军疲劳时，大家念起“学文学武不怕吃苦”的“枪杆诗”，脚底下立刻就加了劲。南线攻势中，沿途群众热烈欢迎帮助，战士们纷纷作诗感谢表明决心，余元坤写的是：“受了人民尊敬，决心消灭敌人，作战上了战场，报国报党报人民”。
    根据已有经验，这种“枪杆诗”有三大好处：一、人人可以写，不会写的叫人代写，随时随地可以念，吸收了广大指战员参加，打破了过去宣传鼓动工作只限于少数干部和积极分子的狭小圈子。而且宣传鼓动口号是根据各人的要求，用各人自己的语言写成，因此非常具体有效。二、把立功计划诗歌化，战士们容易记住，而且非常灵活，随时按照新任务写新诗歌，因而有力的推动了各项工作。三、提高了战士的文化水平，战士们编好了自己的“枪杆诗”，就很有兴趣的去念它看它写它，这样把许多生字都记熟了。
