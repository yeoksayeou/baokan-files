Xinhua News Agency, Su, Lu, Yu, and An Front, 8th:  For over a month, the Su, Lu, Yu, and An People's Liberation Army has been fighting and studying simultaneously, extensively carrying out the Speak Bitterness movement. Cadres and staff in the offices mostly use intensive training methods. Cadres of the Field Headquarters and most columns carry their backpacks to the companies to learn from the soldiers.  A certain unit completed its entire study plan during the battle to destroy the Longhai Railway. In the 5th Battalion of this unit, the battalion commander took the lead in speaking bitterness and convened a revenge swearing-in conference. Everyone drank chicken blood wine and solemnly read the oath to avenge and perform meritorious service while raising their guns.  In a letter to the regiment commander requesting to kill the enemy and perform meritorious service, they wrote: "In our entire battalion, 59 comrades have personally experienced the bitterness of begging for food, 15 comrades' parents were persecuted to death by landlords, 9 comrades' siblings starved to death due to poverty and lack of food, and 17 comrades' mothers, siblings, and themselves were sold. Comrade Wang Lixian's mother, in order to breastfeed the landlord's child, personally strangled her own son. Comrade Meng Jixian's younger sister was torn apart and killed by a landlord. We must avenge these blood debts." The next day, the battalion established mass work teams and meritorious service committees. The 9th Battalion's land reform study was progressing to the point of stamping the oath to kill the enemy and avenge when they received the task of suppressing Chiang bandit troops in Yimenji. Everyone immediately rushed there. Upon discovering Chiang's bandit troops several times their size, the soldiers charged straight into the enemy's formation, brandishing their swords. A certain column established the dominance of hired and poor peasants. The leadership of most branches has been transformed, mainly by hired and poor peasants, becoming the core of organizing learning. A certain unit of this column first organized hired and poor peasant comrades to speak bitterness in the land reform training team, using vivid examples to defeat various landlord-rich peasant thoughts and petty-bourgeois reformist views. Then, using the method of "check and compare," they exposed today's thoughts and behaviors and compared them with the class life of hired and poor peasants to see if they had forgotten their roots and stood firm on the class stand. Then compare with the class life of landlords and rich peasants to see if they were infected with landlord and rich peasant thinking. At the same time, it was proposed: If the investigation and comparison are not thorough or deep enough, go to the soldiers and "continue the investigation" and "continue the comparison." Therefore, all comrades who participated in land reform studies have undergone great changes, clarified their right-leaning thoughts on the situation, and corrected erroneous concepts such as resisting the masses, resisting the organization, fearing hardship, and being uneasy about work. Many comrades from landlord backgrounds stood up to accuse the landlords of their crimes. Comrades from petty-bourgeois backgrounds also stood firm on the side of hired and poor peasants under the influence of the bitterness spoken by hired and poor peasant comrades and the accusations made by comrades from landlord backgrounds. The 3rd Company of the 2nd Regiment organized comrades from different backgrounds and who had suffered different hardships to conduct a chain of speaking bitterness. Whenever a certain type of question was debated, a typical case of bitterness of that type would appear, using vivid facts to draw conclusions for each question. The political instructor of a certain artillery company fully promoted democracy in leading land reform studies, consulting with hired and poor peasants in everything, from clarifying confused concepts and speaking bitterness to investigating thoughts, to settling accounts for making foreign fortunes, corruption, and hedonistic behaviors. The company commander of the company automatically handed over a gold ring that was part of his foreign fortune during the help everyone gave to check thoughts. The entire company also proposed to settle the root of landlord and rich peasant thinking. All property was publicized and registered. A certain unit held a comparison exhibition in the 1st company, displaying the homes of landlords and the homes of hired peasants. Under the contrast, they reflected on themselves and began to speak bitterness. In the land reform training of a certain unit’s cadres, they participated in land reform work in the villages. After the masses divided the land, they automatically asked the troops for guns and grenades to arm themselves for self-defense, thus resolving the ideological doubts about whether the masses in the new area dared to ask for land. In the land reform study of cadres directly under a certain column, they mobilized the masses in the village and nearby to divide the floating wealth of the landlords and local bullies. Some comrades made a foreign fortune for themselves when dividing the floating wealth, specifically exposing landlord and rich peasant thinking. The 4th Company of a certain unit proposed: "Think whenever you have free time, speak bitterness whenever you have hardship." Land reform education was completed during the frequent marching and combat for thirty-three days. Sun Chenfa, a special agent who had been hiding for several years, was deeply moved and automatically confessed to the Party, vowing to be a new person. In the Shanan battle, he volunteered to serve as a demolitions expert and has now been elected as a mutual aid group leader. Li Huazhou, a liberation fighter who had tried to desert six times, was moved by speaking bitterness. During the Zhoukou battle, he rushed to the front, and when his hand grenades ran out, he used bricks to force the enemy to surrender. After studying, the company's mass discipline also improved significantly. In the past month, no one in the entire company damaged anything belonging to the masses and helped the masses carry water and do chores.

　　苏鲁豫皖部队整军
    诉苦复仇不要忘本
  　改造领导贫雇当家
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线八日电】苏鲁豫皖人民解放军月余来，一面打仗，一面学习，广泛开展诉苦运动。干部及机关勤杂人员多采用集训办法。野直及多数纵队之干部，并自背背包到连队向战士学习。某部于陇海路破击战期间，紧张的完成了全部学习计划。该部五大队由大队长带头诉苦，并召开了复仇宣誓大会，每人喝了鸡血酒，举起枪庄严的宣读复仇立功誓词。他们在写给团长要求杀敌立功的信上说：“我们全大队有五十九个同志亲身尝过讨饭的苦，有十五个同志的父母被地主逼死打死，有九个同志的兄弟姊妹因穷困没饭吃而活活饿死，有十七个同志的母亲兄弟姊妹和本人被卖掉。王立贤同志的母亲为了给地主的孩子喂奶，亲手捏死了自己的儿子。孟继先同志的妹妹被地主撕开两腿而死。这些血海深仇一定要报。”第二天该大队便成立群众工作组和立功委员会。九大队的土地改革学习，正进行到在杀敌复仇誓词上盖印之际，接到了进剿义门集蒋匪的任务，大家立即飞驰而去，当发现数倍于我的蒋匪时，战士们纵马挥刀，直扑敌阵。某纵队确立雇贫农的优势，一般支部领导成份均经改造，以雇贫农为主，成为组织学习的核心。该纵队某部土地改革集训队首先组织雇贫农同志诉苦，以活生生的事例，将各种地主富农思想及小资产阶级改良主义的观点击败，然后用“查一查”“比一比”的方法，揭发今天的思想行为并与雇贫农的阶级生活相对比，看是否忘了本，是否站稳了阶级立场。再和地主富农的阶级生活相对比，看是否染了地主富农思想。同时提出：查比不彻底不深刻的到战士面前去“续查”“续比”。因此凡是参加土地改革学习的同志，都有了很大的转变，澄清了对时局的右倾思想，及对抗群众、对抗组织、怕吃苦、不安心工作等错误观念。许多地主成份的同志起来控诉地主的罪恶。小资产阶级出身的同志则在雇贫农同志诉苦与地主成份同志控诉的影响下也站稳到雇贫农方面来。二团三连组织不同来历和受过不同苦难的同志进行连环诉苦，争论到那一类问题时，即有那一类的典型诉苦出现。以有声有色的事实做了每个问题的结论。某部炮兵连政指领导土地改革学习中充分发扬民主，凡事和雇贫农商量，从弄清糊涂观念诉苦查思想，直到清算发洋财、贪污、享乐等行为。该连连长在大家帮助查思想中，自动把发洋财的金戒指交公。全连并由此提出要清算地主富农思想的根。所有财物都实行公布登记。该部一连举行对比展览会，布置了地主的家庭和雇农的家庭。在对比之下，回想自己，展开诉苦。某部干部土地改革集训中，参加驻村土地改革工作，群众分地之后，自动向部队要枪、要手榴弹，武装自卫，于是解决了“新区群众敢不敢要土地”的思想疑虑。某纵队直属队干部土地改革学习中，发动驻村及附近群众分地主恶霸浮财，有些同志在分浮财时自己发了洋财，具体暴露了地主富农思想。某部四连提出：“有空就想，有苦就诉”。在三十三天频繁的行军作战中，完成了土地改革教育。隐藏了几年的特务分子孙辰法，深受感动自动向党坦白，立誓重新做人。沙南战斗，他自告奋勇要求担任爆破，现已被选为互助组长。曾六次想开小差的解放战士李华周为诉苦感动，在周口战斗时，冲在最前面，手榴弹打完了用砖头迫使敌人缴枪。该连经学习后，群众纪律也显著提高，一月来全连无一人损坏群众的东西，并帮助群众挑水作活。
