I am Xu Geng from Nan Congjing, Wu'an, and am twenty-eight years old this year. My family of origin currently has three people. In the past, we rented land, but after the liberation, we have twelve mu of land and one mu of graveyard. My husband's family is from this village. When I married Cao Guo, his family had no land. They had four south-facing rooms and three main rooms, which were mortgaged outside. We lived in two rooms, which had holes and were only worth one and a half rooms. My husband's mother died when he was eight, and his father died when he was sixteen, so he had no way to make a living. I did odd jobs, and my husband worked as a long-term worker for his aunt's family. After a year, he became very weak, and they didn't keep him, so he returned home. He worked in a restaurant for a year, but it didn't work out. Uncle Cao Fenglin (Cao Baogui's father) asked him to endure suffering. He only gave him two mao a year. After a year of suffering, he returned home again. Later, I rented Cao Baogui's eight mu of land myself. During the rent reduction and debt clearing, he wanted to take it back, but I didn't let him because it wasn't long enough. I had just planted it, but he still took it back. This planted the seeds of hatred.

During the liberation, I received two thousand yuan the first time. Last winter, I was given ten jin of wheat for relief, while some households were given twenty or thirty jin. The second time, I was given more than twenty jin of mung beans, eight chi of willow cloth, and some old needles and thread. This time, I was given a score of five, which was the lowest score. The highest score was forty-something. After I was deducted, all my things were confiscated by the village cadres. Their intention was to make it impossible for me to live, so that I would have to find a partner.

Let me talk about my husband. When I was eighteen or nineteen years old, my husband left without a word to join the army. After a few days, he came home once to change his military uniform. The first year, due to bad harvests, he came back again. I heard that the army didn't want him. Later, Tian Liu from our street led him back to the army. In July of the following year, he returned home after being discharged. Unable to make a living at home, he went to the fields to pick wild vegetables. He said, "If I don't have anything to eat, I will starve to death at home." In August of the thirty-second year of the Republic of China, when there was a famine, I went to the fields to harvest grain and asked him to watch the door. When I came back, he was gone, probably having gone with the army. I went to Cao Fenglin's house, but he wasn't there. More than a month later, Cao Fengshan told me that my husband had gone to his aunt's house in Bei Congjing and left from there. His aunt had also given him ten yuan. After that, there was no news.

In May of the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China, Cao Baogui filed a lawsuit, saying that I had killed my husband. Because of the land withdrawal, he had a grudge against me. He was a landlord and a special agent. This year, the village killed him. At that time, I didn't know these things. He was still a militiaman. He sent me to the detention center, where I stayed for six or seven months, and was released in December.

After returning home, I went to my aunt's house in Bei Congjing to ask about my husband. My aunt said, "He came here, but I don't remember which year or date it was." My aunt's daughters chimed in, saying, "Brother 'Jian Guo' was sitting at the south wall door, looking very thin." My aunt quickly said, "How can children remember so clearly!" I said, "I'm not messing with Cao Baogui, I want to find out where he went, whether he's dead or alive, I'll be satisfied if I find him." My husband is my aunt's (not a blood aunt) nephew, and Cao Baogui is also her nephew. One had no power, and the other had power, so my aunt said these words.

Since I couldn't find any news about my husband, I didn't dare to have any more relationships with Zhao Yu (my lover), because I was afraid of being tortured. At this time, the village arranged for me to remarry to Li Tianhe. I didn't want to because he was too young. Then, the political director Pei Chengcai took advantage of my difficult life and became intimate with me. The political director is over forty years old and has only one eye. His family has four people and now has forty-something mu of land, two mules, and hires a long-term worker. He likes to mess around with women. Because of this, his wife tried to hang herself. He's still messing around with a loose woman. He wanted to have a relationship with me, but I didn't agree. He threw me money, and I scolded him for being shameless and gave the money to his wife. Later, the masses and cadres discussed and asked me to remarry. I talked to the village chief: "I can't avoid leaving, I agree to remarry Zhao Yu." The village chief didn't say anything, but the political director was not satisfied and said that if I was going to leave and marry Zhao Yu, he would find my mistakes. This is what the political director's wife told me, she confronted me about this. In April or May of this year, Little Song Yi, who was herding sheep, asked me to marry Zhao Yu, but I didn't dare to mention it. The village also introduced me to several others, but I didn't agree.

In June of this year, they detained me again. I was detained for five or six days. On the 23rd, they held a meeting to question me about killing my husband. The director of the Farmers' Association and other cadres and militiamen interrogated me for a while, saying that if I said my husband was in Nanyangyi, I would have to bring him up. If I didn't admit to killing him, they would beat me to death. I didn't admit it, so they hung me up seven times in a row, took off my upper body clothes, and beat me until I was black and blue all over. Finally, they threatened me with a branding iron, and I falsely confessed. They also asked me to confess the location of the body. At first, I admitted that the donkey bones that were dug up that year were my husband's body, but that wasn't enough. So I had to say that Zhao Yu and I killed my husband together, and Zhao Yu buried the body. The cadres wrote down my confession, and my family's belongings were confiscated, even my sister's 7,250 yuan was taken away, which was counted by the political director.

After I was detained by the village, Mi Gui, the village chief's nephew, was on guard. I said to him, "Go tell the village chief (Pei Yuezhong) and ask Lao Gui Fang, and he will know the whereabouts of my husband." He said, "I know, Lao Gui Fang told the village chief's wife that it was unjust for you to kill your husband. The village chief sighed after hearing this. His wife said to Lao Gui Fang, "Can't you testify?" Lao Gui Fang said, "I dare to say it if someone asks me, but I don't dare to say it at the meeting, I'm afraid." This is the truth.

There was also a militiaman on guard named Jia Ershuang. He said that I was stubborn. He said, "It'll be fine if you find a partner. There are now one hundred and thirty-seven single men, from eighteen to thirty-five years old. You can be with whoever you want." But even if I leave, I don't want to wear the hat of a murderer.

　　贫雇妇女徐更的控告坏村干裴成才
    我是武安南丛井人，今年二十八岁。娘家现在有三口人。过去租种地，翻身以后，有了十二亩地，一亩坟地。婆家是本村，我嫁曹国的的时候，他家里没有地。有四间南屋，三间堂屋、当在外边。俺住了两间屋，有窟窿，只顶一间半。男人八岁死了娘，十六岁死了爹，没法过。我做营生，男人给姑姑家当长工，当了一年，身体很软，人家不收，他就回了家。在饭铺站了一年，不行。叔公公曹凤林（曹宝贵的爹）叫他去受，一年只给两毛钱，受了一年，又回了家。以后我自己当下曹宝贵的八亩地，减租清债的时候，他要抽，我不叫抽，因为不够年限，我刚种上，人家还是抽回去了。就这样还种下了仇气。
    翻身当中，我头回分了两千元。去年冬天救济了我十斤麦子，有的户就救济了二、三十斤。第二回分给我二十多斤绿豆，八尺柳条布，还有些破旧针线。这回给我定的是五分，是最少的分数。顶高的是四十来分。我被扣以后，东西都叫村干部没收了。他们的用意是叫我没法过，不能不找对象。
    说说俺男人吧。我十八、九岁的时候，男人没哼气，出去当了兵。走了几天，回家一趟，换了军装。头一个赖年景，又回来了，听说是部队不要他。后来俺街田流的又把他领回部队。第二年七月，退伍回来，在家没法，到地里拾剌菜。他说：“我没吃的，在家会饿死。”三十二年八月里，正闹灾荒。我到地里割谷，叫他看门，我回来，不见他了，大概是跟军队走了。我找到曹凤林家，没有。过了一个多月，曹凤山对我说，俺男人到了北丛井姑姑那里，就从那里走了。姑姑还给了他十元钱。以后就没有音信了。
    民国三十四年五月，曹宝贵告了一状，说我害死男人。因为抽地，他和我有仇气。他是地主，又是特务，今年叫村上捣死了。那时不知道这一些，他还当着民兵。把我送到看守所，住了六、七个月，十二月才放出去。
    我回家以后，到北丛井姑姑家问过俺男人，姑姑说：“过秋的时候，是从这里走的。”姑姑家的媳妇也这样说。
    后来有一天，我和老桂芳闲扯，他说：“三十三年四月初十，我在南阳邑见过他（俺男人），拉了一个红骡子，穿着绿军装，叫我喂头口。开头我不理，他叫了我声老桂芳，我一看是他，瘦得不象样子。我说：‘小国的，你去姑姑家喂罢。’就带他到了姑姑家。”这个事，在我被扣的时候，老桂芳在街上说。老桂芳是翻身户，在南阳邑住长工，三十四年五月才回家，和副村长裴正富住在一个院里。
    去年正月，我到南阳邑去打听男人的消息。姑姑说：“来是来了，不记得是哪一年，哪个日期了。”姑姑家的小女们插嘴说：“见国”的哥哥在南墙门坐哩，瘦得不象人样。”姑姑赶紧说：“孩子们怎记得这样清！”我说：“我不是和曹宝贵弄事，我想打听人去了哪里，不管死活，我找到就满意了。”我男人是姑姑（不是亲姑姑）的侄儿，曹宝贵也是她的侄儿，一个没法，一个有法，姑姑才说了这些话。
    俺男人的消息打听不着，我也没敢再和赵玉（我相好的）发生关系，我怕动刑。这时，村上给我说合，叫我改嫁给李天何。我嫌他太年青，不愿意。接着，政治主任裴成才趁我生活艰难，和我亲近。政治主任四十多岁，一个眼。他家四口人，现在有四十来亩地，两个骡子，雇着一个长工。他好搞破鞋，因为这，他女人上过吊，到现在他还搞一个破鞋。又要和我搞关系，我不同意。他丢给我票子，我骂他不要脸，又把票子送给了他老婆。后来，群众、干部酝酿，叫我改嫁。我找村长谈：“我躲不开走，我同意改嫁给赵玉”村长没啥，政治主任不满意，说我要外走给赵玉，就找我的错误，这是政治主任老婆对我说的，她和我对事。今年四五月里，放羊的小宋义叫我和赵玉结婚，我不敢提了。村上还给我介绍了几个，我都没答应。
    今年六月，又把我扣起来，扣了五六天，二十三日开大会，问我害死男人的事情。农会主任等干部、民兵审问了一阵，说我要是说俺男人在南阳邑，就得叫上来。不承认害死，就打我一死。我不承认，就把我连吊了七次，脱了上身衣裳，打得我浑身黑烂青。最后又拿烙铁威胁我，我假承认了。还叫我坦白尸首，开头我承认那年刨出的驴骨头，就是男人尸首，还不行，这才硬说赵玉和我一块害死的男人，尸首是赵玉埋的。干部们写下口供，把我家的东西没收了，连俺妹妹的七千二百五十块钱也捎带走了，这是政治主任点过的。
    我叫村上扣起来以后，村长的侄儿米桂站岗，我和他说：“你去告诉村长（裴月中），问问老桂芳，就知道俺男人的下落。”他说：“我知道，老桂芳对村长老婆说过，说你害死男人是冤屈的。村长听罢叹了口气。他老婆对老桂芳说：“你不能去证明？”老桂芳说：“有人问我我敢说，叫我到大会上说，我不敢，害怕。”这是实事儿。
    还有一个站岗的民兵，叫贾二双，他说我脑筋死。他说：“找个对象就没事了。现在光棍汉有一百三十七个，十八到三十五岁的，想跟谁对象，就跟谁对象。”可是，我就是外走，也不愿意带杀人的帽子。
