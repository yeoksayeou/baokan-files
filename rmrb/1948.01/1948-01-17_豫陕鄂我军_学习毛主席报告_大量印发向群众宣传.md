Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, 15th. Chairman Mao's New Year's message has inspired the soldiers and civilians on the front lines. After receiving it, various regions have printed it in large quantities and propagated and explained it to the masses. When a certain unit propagated this document to the masses in Baofeng on the 4th, it also distributed woodcut portraits of Chairman Mao to the attending farmers. The audience spread the word everywhere and hung the portraits of Chairman Mao in picture frames. The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army are now taking advantage of breaks in combat to study Chairman Mao's message. The political department of a certain unit has also decided to devote three months to in-depth study. Everyone will conduct self-criticism and improve their work style in connection with their work and thoughts. It is also stipulated that the quality of study will be one of the criteria for measuring the work of party members and cadres.

    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十五日电】新年发表的毛主席文告鼓舞着前线军民，各地收到后均大量印发，并向群众宣传讲解。某部四日在宝丰向群众宣传这一文件时，并以毛主席木刻像分赠到会农民。听众都四出传告，并把毛主席像用镜框挂起。解放军指战员现均利用战斗间隙，学习毛主席文告。某部政治部并决定以三个月时间专门深入学习。每个人结合工作与思想，进行检讨，改进作风。并规定学习的好坏，作为衡量党员干部的工作标准之一。
