【Taiyue News】According to the Changzi Masses News, the Changzi government, due to simply using administrative orders for labor徵用 without thorough inspection, caused hired poor peasants to suffer greatly from heavy labor burdens. For example, in Majian Village, Fourth District, there are 45 male full laborers and 71 half laborers. Among them, 36 male full and half laborers do not perform labor service, while 67 do. Among those who drive livestock, 13 do not perform labor service, accounting for one-third of the number of those who do. Among these, hired poor peasants bear the heaviest burden of labor service. For instance, hired poor peasant Wang Yongchang, a newly turned-over household, performed 113 days of labor service in nine months. Middle peasant Shen Chouhan performed 115 days of labor service in nine months. However, struggle target Wang Heren only performed 33 days of labor service in nine months. These three people performed a total of 261 days of labor service. The average labor service days per person should be 87 days. Poor peasant Wang Yongchang performed 26 days more, middle peasant Shen Chouhan performed 28 days more, and struggle target Wang Heren performed 54 days less. From this example, it can be seen that the labor徵用 is extremely unfair. Therefore, a mass in the First District said: "Poor people cannot turn over no matter how hard they work. No matter how productive you are, you have to sell your land after performing labor service once." This kind of bureaucracy should not only be corrected quickly, but also be linked with the examination of landlord and rich peasant thought. Why does the struggle target perform so little labor service, while the peasants perform so much?

### 长子检查官僚作风　支差不公雇贫吃亏

　　长子检查官僚作风
  　支差不公雇贫吃亏
    【太岳消息】据长子群众报载：长子政府因为单纯用行政命令要差，不深入检查致使雇贫农支差繁重吃了大亏。如四区马箭村有男全劳力四十五个，半劳力七十一个，其中男全半劳力不支差的三十六个，支差的六十七个。赶牲口的十三个，不支差的占支差人数的三分之一，其中要算雇贫农支差最重。如雇贫农王永昌是个新翻身户，九个月中支差一百一十三天。中农申丑汉，九个月支差一百一十五天。可是斗争对象王和仁，九个月只支了三十三天。这三个人共支了二百六十一天，三人平均每人该支差八十七天，贫农王永昌就多支了二十六天，中农申丑汉多支二十八天，斗争对象王和仁少支了五十四天。从这一例子看，差务太不公平了，所以一区有个群众说：穷人多会也翻不了身，不管你怎样能生产，支一回差就得卖地了。这种官僚主义不光要很快纠正，还应当和检查地主富农思想联系起来，为什么斗争对象支差这样少，农民支差这样多。
