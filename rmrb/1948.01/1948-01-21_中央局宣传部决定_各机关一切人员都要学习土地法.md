　　Central Bureau Propaganda Department Decides
  　All Personnel in All Organs Must Study the Land Law
    [This newspaper's report] The Central Bureau Propaganda Department has decided: All levels of Party, government, military, civilian organs and organizations must study the Outline Land Law of China, the Border Region Government's Supplementary Measures on the Implementation of the Outline Land Law, the Border Region Government's Proclamation Supporting the Land Law, the Military Region's Order to the Troops on the Implementation of the Land Law, the Letter to Party Members, and the Letter to Peasants and other documents. From the leading cadres to the odd-job personnel, all must participate in the study, without exception. It is pointed out that implementing the Outline Land Law of China is a revolutionary historical task, requiring every comrade to earnestly engage in study with a serious and responsible attitude. Since the "May 4th" directive, many organs have not organized everyone to seriously study the relevant land reform documents, resulting in many comrades committing mistakes without even knowing it, let alone the whole Party uniformly promoting land reform. The reason why these comrades made mistakes is, of course, due to problems in their thinking, and not caring about land reform, but one of the reasons is also that the leading comrades did not effectively educate those below. In the future, we must remember this lesson, and in conjunction with rectifying the ranks, universally and deeply carry out land reform education, and no comrade will be allowed to not understand the Outline Land Law, and no comrade will be allowed to not care about land reform work. Not only must they study themselves, but they must also publicize it to the masses and patiently explain difficult problems to them.

　　中央局宣传部决定
  　各机关一切人员都要学习土地法
    【本报消息】中央局宣传部决定：各级党政军民机关团体，必须学习中国土地法大纲、边府关于执行土地法大纲补充办法、边府拥护土地法布告、军区给部队执行土地法的命令、告党员书、告农民书等文件；自首长至杂务人员，一律参加学习，均不得例外。指出执行中国土地法大纲，是一个革命的历史任务，要求每个同志，以严肃负责的态度，认真进行学习。“五四”指示以来，很多机关没有组织大家认真学习有关土地改革的文件，以致很多同志犯了错误还不知道，更说不上全党一致推动土地改革的进行了。这些同志之所以犯错误，固然由于他们思想上有问题，不关心土地改革，而领导同志没有对下面切实进行教育，也是原因之一。今后必须记取这一教训，结合整顿队伍，普遍而深入的进行土地改革教育，再不许有一个同志不懂得土地法大纲，不许有一个同志不关心土地改革工作。不仅自己学习，还须向群众宣传、给他们耐心的解释疑难问题。
