　　Military University Launches Study Craze
  　Diligently Studying Chairman Mao's Report
　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The entire body of cadres at the Military Region's Military and Political University are diligently studying Chairman Mao's report, creating a study craze. Because everyone fully recognizes the importance of this document, they are consciously willing to study it well, so the enthusiasm for learning is universally high. The school newspaper published an editorial on the 15th, pointing out: "Grasping the spirit of Chairman Mao's report is of paramount importance in learning. To grasp the spirit, we must conduct detailed research on the content of the document to understand the position from which the question is raised, what it explains, and what are the grounds and reasons; and distinguish between their importance, major and minor aspects. After grasping the spirit, use it as a weapon to examine one's own thoughts and work, so as to further understand the spirit of the document." The study method adopted by each group is to discuss the center of the document section by section, while raising questions for research and discussion. At present, the atmosphere of studying problems is extremely strong throughout the school. In the discussions, heated debates often occur, even delaying meal times because of the debates. The research office and the organization department's groups are still arguing incessantly during meals. The club and mimeograph team groups have exposed many serious vague thoughts in the discussion, and are deeply studying to find solutions. This study began on the 6th and is currently continuing to develop.

　　军大掀起学习热潮
  　认真研究毛主席报告
    【本报消息】军区军政大学全校干部认真钻研毛主席报告，已形成学习热潮。由于大家充分认识了这个文件的重要性，自觉的愿意把它学好，因此学习情绪普遍高涨。校刊于十五日发表社论，指出：“领会毛主席报告精神，在学习中具有头等重要的意义，要领会精神，就必须对文件的内容作细致的研究，去领会问题是从什么立场上提出，是说明什么，有什么根据与理由；并分别其轻重与主要次要。掌握精神之后，就把它作为武器，来检查自己的思想与工作，这样才能对文件精神作进一步的领会。”各组的学习方法，采用逐段座谈文件中心，同时提出问题，钻研讨论。现全校研究问题的空气，极为浓厚。在讨论中，时常发生热烈争论，甚至因为争论耽误了吃饭的时间。研究室、组织部小组在吃饭时还在争论不休。俱乐部、油印股小组，在讨论中暴露出许多严重的模糊思想，正在深入学习，求得解决。此次学习从六日开始，现正在继续发展中。
