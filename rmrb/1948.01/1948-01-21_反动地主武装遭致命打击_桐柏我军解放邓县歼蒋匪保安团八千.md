Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 19th – A unit of the People's Liberation Army of the Tongbai Military Region, since the 9th, has been advancing towards Deng County in southwestern Henan. On the 15th, at dusk, a general offensive was launched, and on the morning of the 16th, the entire city was liberated. In one fell swoop, the defending enemy, Chiang Kai-shek's eleven security regiments, totaling more than 8,000 men, were annihilated, and many were captured. Detailed battle results are currently being tallied. The Nanyang, Neixiang, and Deng County areas of southwestern Henan are the main bases of the counter-revolutionary landlord armed forces. Chiang Kai-shek attempted to use their "joint village, joint county" organizations to mutually support and defend. As a result of this battle, the counter-revolutionary landlord armed forces in southwestern Henan have suffered a devastating blow.

Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Front, 19th – The Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei People's Liberation Army celebrated and congratulated their achievements during the New Year festivities. Nearly 4,000 meritorious individuals were warmly honored at large gatherings in various units. Communist Party members have generally played a leading role in the merit-making campaign. Party members accounted for 60 percent of the meritorious individuals in one unit and 65 percent in another. At the gatherings, each unit announced its achievements in the past year in combat and in mobilizing the masses. One unit participated in six campaigns in southern Shanxi, Longhai, and Pinghan within a year, annihilating 15,900 enemy troops and capturing ten senior enemy generals, including Wu Tinglin and Li Yingcai, creating a brilliant record of annihilating a large number of enemies with a single unit. The number of enemies annihilated has now exceeded the unit's original plan by three times. In combat, renowned combat heroes such as Li Buzhou and Shi Lailiang have accumulated even more merits and received glorious commendations for the fourth time. Furthermore, since crossing the Yellow River to the south three months ago, this unit has correctly implemented the Party Central Committee's call to "hold a gun in one hand and mobilize the masses in the other." A total of 254,000 farmers were mobilized and helped to organize 66 village governments in 707 villages and towns. Soldier Ma Baolu is a model of propaganda and mass mobilization, and was awarded a special merit this time. Another unit annihilated more than 14,000 enemy troops within a year, capturing 173 artillery pieces and 640 machine guns of various types. One battalion of this unit alone annihilated 2,583 enemy troops throughout the year, enough for a full regiment, and the captured weapons and military supplies, after equipping a regiment, still had a surplus. In combat and work, many heroes emerged from all arms of service: such as Wang Yuntang, deputy company commander of the fourth company of a certain regiment, who was a commander; Qin Migui, a medic; Wang Zhiyuan, an artilleryman; Huo Zhibin, an engineer and demolition expert; and Guo Xiao'e, a hero of mass mobilization. Model squad leader Wang Anguo was promoted to platoon leader for his combat achievements. After the meetings, exhibitions of battle achievements and captured goods were held, and the masses crowded around rows of cannons, praising them with joy. On the day of celebrating and congratulating their achievements, the meritorious individuals wore red ribbons and flowers, and paraded on horseback or in cars. The leaders of one unit personally led the horses for the meritorious individuals, showing the supreme glory of the people's heroes. Amidst the sound of gongs and drums, the Yangko teams of each unit, together with the local masses, paid New Year's greetings to the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the meritorious individuals led the entire army in swearing an oath before the huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, raising their arms and shouting, their voices shaking the heavens. This mighty army of Mao Zedong is determined to add to its merits in 1948 and strive for even greater victories.
