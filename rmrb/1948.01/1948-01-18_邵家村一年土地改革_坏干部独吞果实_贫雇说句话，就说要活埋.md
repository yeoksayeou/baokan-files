　　Shao Jia Village’s Year of Land Reform
　　Bad Cadres Monopolize the Fruits
　　Poor and Hired Peasants Speak Up and Are Threatened with Being Buried Alive
　　Village Cadres Embezzle and Waste the Fruits; Eating Eight Large Bowls of Food at Every Meal
　　[Qingfeng News] In Qingfeng County's Second District, village cadres such as Shao Ti'an (head of the agricultural association of Shaojia Village), Sun Jiming (village head), Sun Fukuan, and Sun Fuchang (anti-requisition director), have suppressed hired and poor peasants, engaged in embezzlement and corruption, and monopolized most of the fruits of struggle in the village during the year or so of land reform and review. The floating wealth, worth tens of millions or more, has rarely been distributed to the masses. The hired and poor peasants still live in great suffering, urgently demanding a complete turnaround. Shaojia Village is a relatively large village in the second district of Qingfeng, where landlord rule has always been more severe than in other villages. The 26 landlord and rich peasant households own most of the land in the village. The village's 170-plus hired and poor peasant and middle peasant households own very little land. After more than a year of land reform and review in the village, a particularly large amount of land, houses, and floating wealth was recovered, but the hired and poor peasants received very little, making a turnaround impossible. At the beginning of the land reform, the masses brought out 29 large silver ingots belonging to the landlords. Shao Ti'an, Sun Jiming, Sun Fukuan, Sun Fuchang, Shao Pi'en, and others secretly sold the ingots for several million yuan (the exact amount is under investigation and may be higher), without distributing any of it to the masses. Instead, they became "bosses" (dongjia) and started doing business. They frequently went to Handan, Linqing, Qingfeng, and the Longwangmiao fair in Daming to sell goods, doing business for more than three months. At a profit of one million yuan per month, they earned a total of more than three million yuan. This large sum was enjoyed by the village cadres, who set up large pots in the village every day, with pork, wine, and dishes for every meal, never less than eight bowls, with stewed chicken, eggs, and pork dumplings as common fare. In a few days, they ate several large pigs. The hired and poor peasants, who worked hard but received no fruits, could not bear it any longer and boldly selected several representatives to openly approach the agricultural association head and other cadres. The hired peasant representatives said, "How much money did we get from selling the silver ingots we struggled for? Everyone wants to divide it. When do you think we can divide it?!" The agricultural association head Shao Ti'an and others angrily said, "Damn it! Spreading rumors! Who told you we sold the silver ingots? Report to me, who said that?!" The hired peasants were not afraid and said, "If you didn't sell them, then take out the silver ingots and let everyone see them!" "Bastards! What right do you have to see them?! Would you dare to take responsibility if some were missing?!" The hired peasants were cursed away by the village cadres. That night, Shao Ti'an and others, on the pretext of "suspicion of being a special agent," expelled the most active hired peasant from the agricultural association. Other relatively active agricultural association members (hired and poor peasants) did not receive any fruits either and were so frightened that they dared not say another word. Whenever the village cadres held meetings, they only listened obediently. The village cadres wanted to beat the poor peasant Sun Jiwu (family of a soldier) to death with clubs, but because the masses disagreed, he was reluctantly driven out of the village, never to return (because he had raised objections to the village cadres).
　　　　Using the "Special Agent" Label to Suppress People and Seize Hired Peasants' Residences
　　Shao Ti'an's crimes are countless. When the land reform was just beginning to deepen, he secretly concealed more than 40 mu of good land for the large landlord Shao Dengshun. He used to be a financial assistant in the second district but was dismissed for massive embezzlement. His class status is wealthy middle peasant, but his current life is much better than that of a landlord. He falsely claimed to be the family of a soldier and a poor peasant, and was allocated many more fruits (his grandson went to work in a salaried factory with a very high salary), which made the masses very dissatisfied, but no one dared to mention it. Shao Ti'an wanted to build a better courtyard, so he created a pretext, taking the unallocated bad land (fruits of struggle) and forcefully wanting to exchange it for Shao Shicheng's (a hired peasant) residence. Shao Shicheng refused, saying to Shao Ti'an, "There are five brothers in my family, it's not just mine. Let me discuss it with my five brothers first!" Shao Ti'an was rebuffed and harbored secret schemes. He openly said to the masses, "Shao Shicheng is a special agent! When the Fifth Army (Chiang bandit) was here, he colluded with the Fifth Army, reporting public grain and reporting to the military headquarters. He did it all. He also spreads rumors all day long. He deserves to be beaten to death with clubs!..." He wanted to use threats to achieve his goal of exchanging Shao Shicheng's residence. When these words reached Shao Shicheng's ears, he was so terrified that he quickly asked someone to mediate. He gave his residence to Shao Ti'an with suppressed anger and apologized to him to settle the matter.
　　　　"If You Expose Me, I'll Take Your Head"
　　During the last review, the fruits of struggle in the village were piled up like mountains, surpassing any other village in Qingfeng. Three courtyards were completely filled. In order to systematically embezzle these fruits, the village cadres Shao Ti'an, Sun Jiming, Sun Fukuan, and Sun Fuchang did not keep any accounts. They guarded the fruits day and night, stealing them systematically every night. The hired and poor peasants were not only unable to receive any fruits but were not even allowed to enter the door of where the fruits were stored. When the hired and poor peasants wanted to see the fruits they had personally carried, they were driven out by the village cadres, who said, "Get out! What are you doing here? Trying to steal something? Go ahead, if something is missing, we village cadres won't be responsible!" This frightened the hired and poor peasants so much that no one dared to go and look. In a few days, most of these fruits were stolen by the village cadres Shao Ti'an, Sun Jiming, Sun Fuchang, Sun Fukuan, Shao Pi'en, and others. One night in mid-October, a group of village cadres led by Shao Ti'an and Sun Jiming stole sixteen large bundles (two people could barely lift one). Inside were completely multicolored foreign cloth, silk fabrics, all kinds of good cotton clothes, silk clothes, overcoats, sweaters, leather coats, etc. Coincidentally, militia member Shao Zongli encountered them on the street. Shao Ti'an said, "Zongli! Don't tell anyone, I'll give you some clothes to wear!" Shao Zongli said straightforwardly, "I don't want them! These are the fruits of everyone's struggle, I can't go against my conscience. Can I not tell the masses? You take them away!" Shao Ti'an was furious: "Damn it! If you don't want them, fine! If you expose me, I'll take your head!" Village heads Sun Jiming, Sun Fukuan and others were afraid of the news spreading, and advocated that Shao Zongli be given a share, but Shao Zongli resolutely refused. The village cadres were afraid of his exposure and secretly sent a few clothes to Shao Zongli's home, telling Shao Zongli's family: "If you let the masses know, you won't be able to clear yourself!" Sun Fuchang stole the least, but according to his nephew's wife, "The three large cabinets he stole were not enough to hold everything, completely made of whole bolts of Shirting and silk, leather clothing…" Some things could not be embezzled or stolen because the masses knew about them; such as cattle, mules, livestock, grinding stones, and animal harnesses. However, the village cadres came up with ways to get them in the end. Shao Ti'an sold his small cattle and "distributed" a large cattle to himself in the name of his contributions; he sold his small grinding stone and distributed a large grinding stone to himself, and most of the animal harnesses were also distributed by Shao Ti'an and others. They were also afraid that the masses would get other fruits, so they came up with a way to sell them at fixed prices, which were higher than the market prices. The masses looked at them and couldn't afford them. The masses said, "It's cheaper to buy new ones at the market!" The village cadres said, "If you don't want them, good! We don't mind the bad ones, we want them." Finally, they drastically reduced the price several times, and the village cadres bought them anyway.
　　After all the commotion, the masses did not receive any fruits. The poor and hired peasants said, "We struggled against the landlords, but the village cadres are the ones who distribute the things!" Regarding "taking hired and poor peasants as the backbone," the village cadres said, "Backbone, my foot! Asking him to pull the sled is to make him a backbone, to make him pull a few more times!" Shao Huaiqin's mother, a poor peasant and family member of a soldier, said, "When we women were carrying things, there were so many silk clothes, whole bolts of white cloth, multicolored foreign cloth, leather clothes, overcoats, good quilts, mattresses... Three large houses couldn't hold them all. But now, when it's time to distribute the fruits, all the good things have disappeared. I've asked around all three streets, and no one has received them. Where did they all go?! Why aren't they distributed to us?!" The land in the village was sold to the masses through transactions by the village cadres, but the masses spent money to buy bad land, while the village cadres spent no money to buy good land. The poor and hired peasants in the village all knew that the fruits had been stolen and embezzled by the village cadres, and the good land had been occupied by them. Later, Shao Zongli revealed in front of the masses the secret that the village cadres had stolen sixteen large bundles at night. The whole village was discussing it, brewing the idea that they had not turned over yet, and if they wanted to truly turn over, they must force the village cadres to return the fruits!
　　After the village cadres, led by Shao Ti'an, heard this news, they threatened Shao Huaiqin's mother, a women's activist, saying: "Damn it! People from the county are living here. If the county cadres hear about this, I'll bury you alive in the middle of the night!" "Damn you! If you tell the county cadres, I'll pull your sled!" This soldier's family member and women's association member was so frightened that she became ill. She took medicine five times and hasn't fully recovered yet. When we visited her, we entered her dilapidated house. She was sleeping in the north room, covered with a short, tattered quilt, full of large and small holes, big enough for a small sparrow to fly through. When her son told her that we had come to visit her, she raised her head and burst into tears: "Comrades! If you had come two days later, I would have been scared to death! The village cadres were going to bury me alive again and pull my sled. Now that you've come, even if I die, you'll know how I died! I'm not afraid to die! If you dare to stand up for me, I dare to tell you everything about the village cadres, and I dare to raise issues with the village cadres in a mass meeting!"
　　When we asked her about her turnaround and what fruits she had received, she said, "I received two tattered clothes that I can't even wear. I don't have matches, so I used them as kindling. All the poor peasants in our village received tattered clothes and rags, nothing valuable. I mentioned it to the village cadres, and they cursed me, saying: 'You're still complaining about being given a few tattered clothes! When the 'Central' army comes, they'll rob you of your things too! If you don't like them, don't take them!..."
　　We checked door to door and found that the hired and poor peasants had indeed not received any fruits. Most of the fruits had been either distributed to the village cadres or stolen by them at night. The middle peasants also received more fruits. Based on our investigation: all 170-plus hired and poor peasant households in the village have no land, no livestock, no farming tools, no houses to live in, and no food to eat..., so there's no question of turning over.
　　(Pingyuan, Xueyi)
　　
　　Several despotic village cadres are suppressing the entire village of poor and hired peasants, preventing them from turning over. The poor and hired peasants are still starving, and the village cadres threaten to bury them alive if they say a word... It's good that the leadership has made an initial assessment this time. We believe that we should continue to investigate in depth, uncover the bureaucracy of the leadership, and see if anyone is shielding these audacious and reckless bad cadres. At the same time, we hope that other places will also conduct similar inspections to prepare for the upcoming equitable distribution of land. ——Editor

　　邵家村一年土地改革
  　坏干部独吞果实
    贫雇说句话，就说要活埋
    村干部贪污浪费果实每顿饭吃八大碗
    【清丰消息】清丰县二区邵家村农会长邵体安、村长孙吉鸣、孙福宽、抗勤主任孙福长等村干部，在年余的土地改革和复查中，压制雇贫，贪污腐化，霸占全村大部斗争果实；约值数千万以上的浮财，群众很少分配到手。雇贫还过着非常痛苦的生活，迫切要求彻底翻身。邵家村是清丰二区比较大的村子，地主统治历来就比其他村厉害的多。地主富农共二十六户，占有全村大部土地。全村百七十余户的雇贫、中农，只有很少土地。该村经过了一年多的土地改革和复查，收回的土地、房屋、浮财特别多，可是雇贫很少分到手里，根本谈不到翻身。土地改革开始时，群众搞出地主二十九个大元宝，邵体安、孙吉鸣、孙福宽、孙福长、邵丕恩等人私自把元宝卖了数百万元（详细数目待查，可能还多），丝毫不分给群众，却自己当起老板（东家），作起买卖来了。经常到邯郸、临清、清丰、大名龙王庙贩卖货物，作了三个月以上的买卖，按一月赚百万元计，共可赚三百余万。这一大笔款，村干都享受了，每天在该村安着大锅，顿顿是猪肉、酒、菜，少不了八个碗，烧鸡、鸡蛋、猪肉饺子是家常便饭。不几天，吃了几个大猪。出力分不到果实的雇贫群众，看不下去了，大胆的选了几个代表，公开的找到农会长等干部，雇贫代表说：“咱斗争的元宝卖了多少钱呀？大家意见想分，您看看啥时分？！”农会长邵体安等人气愤地说：“妈的！特务造谣！谁给你说卖了元宝？给我报告，谁说的！”雇贫并不害怕，说：“要是没有卖，你把元宝拿出来叫俺大家看看吧！”“混蛋！你有啥资格看？！少了你敢负责不敢？！”雇贫叫村干凶走了。当天夜里，邵体安等借口“有特务嫌疑”，把最积极的雇贫开除出农会。其他比较积极的农会员（雇贫），也没分到果实，吓得再不敢说一句话，村干啥时开会，只有顺服的听。村干部想乱棍打死贫农孙吉五（军属），由于群众不同意，勉强被撵出村，一辈不准回家（因为他给村干提过意见）。
    　　　　用特务帽子压人霸占雇农宅院
    邵体安的罪恶是数不完的，土地改革刚一进入深入时，他秘密给该村大地主邵登顺隐蔽了四十余亩好地。他从前是二区财政助理员，因大量贪污被开除，他的成份是富裕中农；但现在生活比地主还好得多。他冒充军属、贫农，多分配了好多果实（他孙子去薪金制的工厂工作，薪金很高），群众很不满，但谁也不敢提。邵体安想盖更好的院落，于是生了个疑点，拿着未分的坏地（斗争果实），强要换邵石成（雇贫农）的庄宅，邵石成不愿意，就给邵体安说：“我弟兄五个，不是我自己的，等俺弟兄五个商量好再说吧！”邵体安碰了钉子，就心怀暗算，公开给群众说：“邵石成是特务！五军（蒋匪）在时，他通五军，报告公粮、报告军部，都是他办的。还成天造谣，真该乱棍打死！……”他想用威胁手段达到换邵石成庄宅的目的。这话传到邵石成耳朵里，吓得邵石成胆战心惊，赶快托人讲席说和，把自己的庄宅忍气吞声的给了邵体安，又给他道了歉才算完事。
    　　　　“你要暴露了我要你的脑袋”
    在上次复查中，该村斗争果实堆积如山，全清丰那个村都比不上，三座院填的满满的。村干邵体安、孙吉鸣、孙福宽、孙福长等人为了有计划的贪污，这些果实就没一点帐目，他们日夜看守着，每天夜里有计划的偷拿。雇贫不但分不到手，连存放果实的门也不准进。雇贫想看看自己亲手搬运的果实，进门就被村干撵出来了，并说：“出去！往这里边来干啥？想偷走东西？你进吧，少了东西俺村干不负责！”吓的雇贫谁也不敢去看了。不几天，这些果实就叫村干邵体安、孙吉鸣、孙福长、孙福宽、邵丕恩等人偷了一大部。十月中旬一个夜里，以邵体安、孙吉鸣十余人为首的村干，又偷了十六个大包袱（两个人还抬不动一个），里边完全是五色洋市布、绸缎布，各种好棉衣、绸衣、大衣、毛衣、皮大衣等；碰巧在街上被民兵队员邵宗理遇见了，邵体安说：“宗理！你可别给别人说，我给你几件衣服穿穿！”邵宗理耿直的说：“我不要！这是大家斗争出来的果实，我不能昧良心。我不给人家群众说中不？你拿走吧！”邵体安气坏了：“妈的！你不要算球！你要暴露了，我要你的脑袋！”村长孙吉鸣、孙福宽等人怕跑了风，主张叫邵宗理分一份，可是邵宗理坚决不要。村干部怕他暴露，偷偷的给邵宗理送到家去几件衣服，并给邵宗理家里人说：“要是您叫群众知道了，你也清不了秧！”孙富长偷的最少，但据他侄媳说：“他所偷的三大柜还装不完，完全是成匹的士林洋布、绸缎、皮衣……”有些东西不能贪污，也不能偷，因群众都知道；如牛骡牲畜、磨、牲口套等；可是村干部也生出了办法，终究也得到手了。邵体安把他的小牛卖了，以自己有功为名，“分”到大牛；把他的小磨卖了，分了大磨，大部分牲口套也被邵体安等分了。他们还怕群众得到别的果实，就生了个办法，定价出卖，定的价比市场还高，群众看了看，买不起。群众说的好：“还没有到集上买新的省钱！”村干说：“您不要，好！咱不嫌坏，咱要。”最后大减价几倍，还是村干买了。
    搞来搞去，群众没分到任何果实。贫雇说：“斗争地主是俺办，分东西是村干！”对于“以雇贫为骨干”，村干部说：“骨干个吧！拉滑子是叫他当骨干，叫他多拉几下！”贫农军属邵怀勤的母亲说：“俺妇女搬东西时，绸缎衣服、成匹白洋布、五色洋布、皮衣、大衣、好被子、褥子……多着哩，三座大屋子还填不完。这会分果实时，那好东西都不见了，我前后三街都问了一遍，都没分到手里，都弄哪去啦？！不分给俺为啥？！”村里的土地都是用买卖方式由村干卖给群众，可是群众花钱买的是坏地，村干不花钱买的是好地。该村贫雇群众都知道果实是村干偷光了，贪污了，好地是他们占去了。后来，邵宗理在群众面前揭露了村干夜里偷了十六个大包袱的秘密，全村群众纷纷议论，酝酿着自己没翻了身，要想真正翻身，非叫村干退出果实不可！
    以邵体安为首的村干部听到这风声以后，吓唬妇女积极分子邵怀勤的母亲说：“他妈的！县里人在这里住，这事情要是叫县里干部听到耳朵里，日你奶奶，半夜也得活埋你！”“日你娘！你要给县干部说了，非拉你的滑子不可！”这位军属妇女会员吓病了，吃了五次药，到现在还没好全。当我们访问她时，我们进了她的破烂房子，她正在北屋里睡觉，盖着一条又短又破烂的被子，全是大大小小的窟窿，小麻雀也可飞得进去。当她的儿子告诉她，我们来访问她时，她抬起头来，张嘴大哭起来：“同志！你们再晚来两天，我就吓死了！村干又要活埋我，又要拉我的滑子，你们来了，就是我死了，你们也知道我怎死的！我不怕死！你们敢给我作主，村干的啥事我都敢给你们说，在群众大会上也敢给村干提！”
    当我们问她翻身情形，分了啥果实时，她说：“分了两件破衣裳，也不能穿，没洋火，就当火纸用了。俺全村贫农都是分的破衣烂套子，没一样值钱货。俺给村干提了提，叫村干大骂，还说：分给你几件破衣裳还孬呀！‘中央’军来了，还抢你的东西哩！嫌孬，你别要！……”
    我们挨门逐户的检查了一下，雇贫确实是没分到果实，大部果实叫村干多分、夜里偷去了；中农也多分了果实。经我们调查结果：全村百七十余户雇贫，都是没地，没牲畜、耕具，没房子住，没饭吃……，根本说不上翻身。
    　　（平远、学义）
    　　
    几个恶霸村干部压得全村贫雇不能翻身；贫雇还饿着肚子，说一句话村干部就要活埋……领导上这次摸了一下底，是好的，我们认为还应继续深入检查，发掘领导上的官僚主义，看看有没有人包庇这些胆大妄为的坏干部。同时希望别的地方也进行同样的检查，给就要到来的平分土地运动作准备。　　——编者
