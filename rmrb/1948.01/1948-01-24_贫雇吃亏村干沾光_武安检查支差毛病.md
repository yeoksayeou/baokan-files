　　【Wu'an News】The Wu'an County Government convened a meeting of financial and grain assistants on the 19th to inspect the labor levy situation in various districts. It was discovered that in many places, the banner of "taking care of the poor and hired laborers" was used, but in reality, it harmed them:
　　I. Cadres pay less in labor levies but receive more labor grain: When Dongshang Village in the Second District settled labor levy accounts in the tenth day of the eleventh lunar month, the village secretary's labor contribution was very small according to his labor power, only amounting to 112.3 jin of rice. However, the labor account recorded many workdays for him, entitling him to 447 jin of rice, so he made a net profit of more than 335 jin. Village chiefs, anti-requisition cadres, and financial and grain cadres all received between 200 and 300 jin of rice. Where did these workdays come from? The political director of Quanshang Village said, "We record workdays when we attend meetings outside, and we also evaluate seven extra workdays each month." Political directors, village chiefs, and peasant association chairmen in Boyan Village, Third District, received an extra ten workdays in addition to their regular monthly workdays. Therefore, they didn't actually contribute labor but received rice every month. The county government's labor levy regulations stipulate that cadres who eat their own food while attending meetings outside are credited with one workday, and those who eat at the village or public expense are credited with half a workday. However, most villages recorded full workdays. Some even submitted separate expense accounts after recording full workdays. For example, the financial expenditure of Shangquan Village included an item for cadres' meeting rice conversion of 18,900 yuan and vegetable expenses of 70,000 yuan.
　　II. Because cadres contribute less labor and record more workdays, the poor and hired laborers actually contribute more labor, but their recorded workdays are less than those of the cadres, so they have to pay labor levy rice. What if they can't afford it? Use the fruits of struggle to "take care of" the poor and hired laborers, and then ask them to use it as labor levy rice, to be given to the cadres who "should get" labor levy rice "according to workdays." When Xujiapo in the Fourth District settled labor levy accounts, they said that the poor and hired laborers could not afford the labor levy rice, so they took 1,200 jin of millet and 600 jin of wheat from the fruits of struggle and gave it to the poor and hired laborers, and then asked them to turn it over as labor levy rice. Nanan Yao Village had a similar situation, taking 200,000 yuan and 800 jin of millet from the fruits of struggle to "take care of the poor and hired laborers," but in reality, it just passed through their hands and all went to take care of the cadres.
　　III. In villages like Nanbei Qiaohe, Yangtun, and Shishimen in the Fourth District, labor levy accounts were not settled in the first half of the year, and later it was proposed to "wipe it all out" (meaning invalid), so everyone didn't want to take anything out and settled it perfunctorily. Who suffered the loss when we investigated? It was the poor and hired laborers who suffered the loss, because if these villages really settled the accounts, the poor and hired laborers could get some labor levy rice. Zhao Dian and Dongpo villages never settled their accounts throughout the year, remaining confused until the end. In Zhuangshang Village in the Ninth District, accounts were settled every half year, and the poor and hired laborers over-contributed the most labor, over-contributing a total of more than 90 workdays, but it took six months before these over-contributed portions were returned in rice, and the difficulties at home could not be resolved in time.
　　IV. In Datun Village in the Fourth District, "sharp heads don't contribute labor levies." Who are the "sharp heads"? Naturally, they are those "pompous" cadres and those who have relationships with them. Where there are sharp heads, there are silent heads. The poor and hired laborers have not been emancipated and dare not speak, so they can only be silent heads, and the labor levies are all pressed on them. (Wang Qingyu, Ru Xiu)
　　Editor's Note: It is a fact that village cadres have difficulties in paying labor levies, and it should be handled in accordance with regulations; however, the various phenomena mentioned above are incorrect. We feel that not only the poor and hired laborers suffer losses in each village, but also the middle peasants, who are not much better off than the poor and hired laborers, also suffer losses. This inspection in Wu'an is good; but it should be pointed out that the leadership should also conduct a deep self-examination of these erroneous phenomena and formulate more comprehensive labor levy methods based on the opinions of the people.
　　【Shahe News】In Dalian Town, Sixth District of Shahe, labor levies were assigned according to labor power for grain transportation, and the poor and hired laborers suffered great losses. The five main cadres in the North Street of the town raise four mules and two donkeys. The two grain transportation tasks assigned to his street were 20,000 jin. Village cadres stipulated that livestock would not contribute to labor levies, and the task was apportioned among all the male laborers in the street, with each person contributing 80 jin. The two tasks totaled 160 jin. Each share was calculated at 5,000 yuan for freight (six days), and livestock were hired to pull. The entire street contributed a total of eight large carts. Zhao Baozhu, the director of the peasant association, who raises one mule and one donkey himself, contributed one cart alone, pulling 17 shares; in addition to his own share, he earned freight for 16 shares, earning a net profit of 55,000 yuan after deducting expenses for livestock and people. The cadres contributed a total of five carts, pulling 75 shares. The remaining 50 shares were all pulled by the cooperative and the middle peasants' large carts (three carts). The poor and hired laborers only had to pay freight. After the deputy village chief returned, he asked Zhao Man for 5,000 yuan in freight, but he couldn't afford it, and he was forced to pay, and even his rice vat was taken away.

### 贫雇吃亏村干沾光  武安检查支差毛病

　　贫雇吃亏村干沾光
    武安检查支差毛病
    【武安消息】武安县政府十九日召集财粮助理员开会，检查各区支差情况，发现许多地方打着“照顾贫雇”的招牌，实际上却是坑了贫雇：
    一、干部支差少，得差米多：二区洞上村在阴历十一月初十结差帐时，村书记按自己劳力应支差很少，只合出一百一十二斤三两米。但差帐上记了他好多工，应得四百四十七斤米，于是他净赚了三百三十五斤多。村长、抗勤、财粮等干部都是得米二百斤到三百斤不等。这些工从哪里来的呢？泉上村政治主任说：“我们在外开会，按天记差工，每月还给多评七个工。”三区伯延村政治主任、村长、农会主席等干部除每月应记工外，额外多评十个工。因此实际上不支差，反而月月得米。县府支差办法中规定：干部在外边开会吃自己者顶一个工，吃村中或公家者顶半个工。但各村多半都按整工记了。有的记了整工之后，还要另外报帐。如上泉村财政开支中有一笔是干部开会米折款一万八千九百元，菜金七万元。
    二、由于干部支差少，记工多，因此贫雇实际支差虽多，记的工却比干部少，反而得出支差米。出不起怎么办呢？用斗争果实去“照顾”贫雇，再叫他当作支差米，找给“按工”“该得”差米的干部。四区徐家坡结算差帐时，说贫雇出不起差米，从果实中拿出小米一千二百斤，麦子六百斤，交给贫雇户，再让他们当作差米交出来。南安药村也是同样情形，从果实中拿出款二十万元、小米八百斤“照顾贫雇”，实际上是从贫雇那里过了一下手，全部照顾了干部。
    三、四区南北峭河、杨屯、史石门等村，前半年没有算差帐，后来提出“一抹拉”（无效的意思），大家都不往外拿，马马虎虎算了事。追究一下谁吃了亏？又是贫雇吃了亏，因为这些村如果真正算算帐，贫雇可得一些差米。赵店、东坡两村全年没有结算过帐目，一直糊涂到底。九区庄上村半年一算帐，贫雇支差最多，共长支了九十多个差，但直到六个月后，这些多支的部分才得到米，家中困难，不能及时解决。
    四、四区大屯村“尖头不支差”，尖头是什么人？自然是那些“耀武扬威”的干部，与和他们有关系的人。有尖头就有闷头。贫雇没有翻身，不敢说话，只好当闷头，差都压到他们头上了。（王庆余、儒修）
    编者意见：村干支差有困难，是事实，应按规定办；但是上面说的各种现象却是不对的。我们觉得各村吃亏的不仅是贫雇，比贫雇好不了多少的中农同样也是吃了亏。武安这一检查是好的；但应指出：这些错误现象领导上也应作深刻自我检查，根据人民意见，制定更完善的支差办法。
    【沙河消息】沙河六区褡裢镇运粮中按劳力派差，贫雇吃了大亏。该镇北街五个主要干部，喂着四头骡子两头驴。两次运粮派到他街两万斤，村干部规定牲口不支差，按全街男劳力摊派，每人八十斤。两次一百六十斤。每份按五千元脚费计算（六天时间），找牲口拉脚。全街共出八辆大车。农会主任赵保住，自己喂一头骡一头驴，独出一辆车，拉了十七份；除自己一份外，拉脚十六份，除去牲口和人的盘费，净赚五万五千元。干部共出五辆车，就拉了七十五份。下余的五十份，都叫合作社和中农的大车（三辆）拉了。贫雇只有出脚费。副村长回来后向赵满的要五千元脚费，他出不起，硬逼着他要，把他的米缸都搬走了。（高孟、王先庆）
