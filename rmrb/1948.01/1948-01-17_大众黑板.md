    The Border Region Government has issued an order: No one is allowed to destroy our equal distribution of land and property. For example, some landlords don't want to give up their land, so they provoke internal disputes among our peasants or create false struggles. With this decree, we will punish them. If they organize reactionary armed forces, carry out riots, and kill us, they will be committing a capital crime. There are also people who, in the past struggles, took too much of the fruits of victory, and now don't want to return it, so they kill livestock, cut down trees, withdraw shares, and damage farm tools and houses. Some even want to secretly bury things before the equal distribution, and some deliberately waste, eat and drink extravagantly, and still want to suppress us, not allowing us to speak at meetings when we have opinions. All of these actions will now be punished according to the severity of the wrong they have committed.
    Our common people must be vigilant! Watch out for what bad things landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements are doing. If you see them doing bad things, immediately stop them, detain the person, secure the evidence, and send them to the Farmers' Association, the government, or the People's Court.

    边区政府下了一道命令：谁也不能破坏咱们平分土地、财产，比如说有的地主不想拿出土地，便挑拨咱农民内部闹意见，或者制造假斗争，有了这条法令，咱们就要给他办罪。如果他们组织反动武装，实行暴动，杀害咱们，他就犯了　死罪。还有一种人是过去在斗争中，多占了果实，现在不想退，便杀牲口、伐树、抽股子，破坏农具、房子，有的还想趁平分前把东西偷偷埋藏起来，有的故意浪费，大吃大喝，还想压住咱们，咱们有意见也不叫咱们在大会上说话。所有这些，现在都要按他们办的错大错小来处罚。
    咱们老百姓可要留心呀！留心地主、富农、坏家伙干了什么坏事情。如见他们干坏事情，立时就卡住他，卡住人，卡住证据，送到农会、政府、人民法庭去。
