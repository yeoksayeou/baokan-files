　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 21st: Washington dispatch: On the 16th, the reactionary US judicial authorities, under the malicious pretext of "being an alien who advocates overthrowing the US government," arrested Bittelman, one of the leaders of the US Communist Party, and announced that he would be "deported." This arrogant act has angered the American people. US Communist Party leaders Foster and General Secretary Dennis jointly signed a statement to the press on the 18th, demanding that this unreasonable verdict be revoked and that Attorney General Clark be dismissed. The statement pointed out: "The attempt to exile Bittelman is part of a fascist action, which is not only against the Communist Party, but also against organized workers, foreigners, Jews, and all progressive people." Its purpose is to prepare for "a new suppression of the people of the whole country" in order to "realize the military plans" and expansion plans of "'bipartisan unity' (referring to the collusion between the Democratic and Republican parties)." The statement condemned: "It is not Bittelman who threatens the democratic system and the American democratic tradition, but Clark." The statement called on all freedom-loving Americans to rise up and fight for the removal of Clark and the cancellation of Bittelman's deportation case.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 21st: TASS Moscow dispatch: Pravda recently published Isakov's impressions of his visit to the United States in an article entitled "America Today," stating that Wall Street banks and industrial monopolists are pushing the United States onto the road of fascism. Anti-communist slander and the so-called detection of "dangerous ideas" have reached their peak. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Gestapo-style despicable network of spies is all over the United States. Today, what tightly entangles this country is a heavy atmosphere of depression and a very serious spy phobia. The ruling group in the United States keeps talking about "democracy," "human rights," and "freedom of speech," but the more they say, the less democracy and freedom are left in the United States. The article pointed out: The united rule of Wall Street merchants and soldiers is a typical characteristic of today's American political life. After making a fortune from arms, big manufacturers have developed the wild idea of controlling the rest of mankind. They want to indefinitely prolong the post-war unrest in order to profit from the crisis. The article concluded: But among the general public in the United States, among intellectuals, there are warriors loyal to the traditions of Lincoln and Roosevelt. The rampant reaction often produces the opposite of what the fascists expect. This year will be full of intense struggles between progressive and reactionary forces in the world, and this struggle will also unfold in the United States.

　　美共发表声明
  　抗议逮捕毕特曼同志
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】华盛顿讯：十六日，反动的美国司法当局在所谓“身为外侨而号召推翻美国政府”的恶毒借口下，将美共领袖之一毕特曼横加逮捕，并宣布将“驱逐出境”。此种狂妄举动，已使美国人民发怒。美共领袖福斯特及总书记但尼斯共同签名于十八日向报界发表声明，要求取消此种无理判案，并要求将司法部长克拉克撤职。声明指出：“放逐毕特曼的企图，是法西斯行动的一部分，这不仅是反对共产党，而且是反对有组织的工人、外国人、犹太人及一切进步人士”。其目的是准备为了“实现‘两党一致’（指民主党与共和党的勾结）的军事计划”和扩张计划，而“进行对全国人民的新镇压”。声明谴责称：“威胁民主制度与美国民主主义传统的不是毕特曼，而恰恰是克拉克”。声明号召一切爱好自由的美国人，奋起为撤换克拉克和取消毕特曼的放逐案而斗争。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷发表伊萨科夫访美印象记“今日美国”一文称：华尔街银行与工业独占家，正把美国推上法西斯主义的道路。反共污蔑与所谓侦察“危险思想”达到了登峰造极的程度。联邦调查局盖斯塔波式的可憎特务网密布全美。今天紧紧纠缠着这个国家的，乃是沉重的萧条气氛与很厉害的恐特务病。美国统治集团口口声声讲什么“民主”、“人权”和“言论自由”，可是他们说的越多，美国所剩下的民主自由也就越少。该文指出：华尔街商人与军人的联合统治，就是今日美国政治生活的标本特色，大制造商在靠军火大发横财之后，油然产生了控制其余人类的狂想，他们想无限期地拖延战后的不安，以便从中趁火打劫。该文结语称：但在美国一般人民中，在知识分子中，有着忠诚于林肯、罗斯福传统的勇士，反动的猖狂往往产生和法西斯分子所预期的相反的东西。今年将充满世界进步与反动势力间的紧张斗争，这个斗争亦将在美国开展。
