　　Pinghan Front Our Army

  　Recaptures Xuchang City Again
    [Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui, 11th] The People's Liberation Army recaptured Xuchang on the 6th, and ambushed a battalion of the rearguard of the Chiang bandit's Provisional 26th Brigade, which was fleeing north from the city, at Liuzhuang north of the city, capturing the enemy's deputy battalion commander and 65 soldiers alive. Xuchang was reoccupied by the enemy on the 1st.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei, 9th] The Chen Su and Chen Xie People's Liberation Armies on the Pinghan Front launched a enthusiastic mutual learning movement in the jubilation of their meeting. The Political Department of the Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei People's Liberation Army specifically called on its own troops to learn from the Chen Su Army's combat discipline; to learn regular operations and annihilate the enemy in large numbers; and to learn the fine traditions of in-depth land reform education and unity and fraternity. As soon as a certain unit met the Chen Su Army, it organized a visiting group including various cadres, with company commanders visiting company work and platoon leaders visiting platoon work. A certain column also sent a visiting group including three ministers, and discovered that the Chen Su troops had many valuable experiences and creations in the land reform learning process, such as using the poor and hired peasants as the core of the mass line to transform leadership, transform cadre ideology, and conduct in-depth meritorious service model movements, and prepared to bring them back to their own troops to learn. Correspondent Li Minggen, who had been to the Chen Su troops, also told everyone: "They are just good, the correspondents are clear about their tasks, and they are efficient." This greatly strengthened the unity between the two armies.

　　平汉前线我军
  　再次收复许昌城
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线十一日电】解放军六日再克许昌，并在城北刘庄拦击自城内北逃的蒋匪暂编二十六旅后卫一个营，活捉敌副营长以下六十五名。按许昌是一日被敌重占的。
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线九日电】平汉前线陈粟、陈谢两大解放军在会师的狂欢中，展开了热烈的相互学习运动。豫陕鄂解放军政治部特号召自己部队向陈粟大军学习战斗纪律；学习正规作战，大量歼灭敌人；学习部队深入土改教育及团结友爱等优良作风。某部一会到陈粟大军，就组织了一个包括各种干部的参观团，连长参观连的工作，排长参观排的工作。某纵队并派一个包括三个部长的参观组，发现陈粟部队在土改学习中经过贫雇为核心的群众路线来改造领导，改造干部思想和深入的立功表模运动等许多宝贵的经验和创造，准备带回自己部队学习。去过陈粟部队的通讯员李明根也向大家介绍说：“人家就是好，通讯员对自己的任务都明明白白，精精干干”。这大大亲密了两军的团结。
