　　Markos
　　General Markos was born in 1906 and is currently 41 years old. He was born into the family of a rural primary school teacher in Greece.
　　In 1924, he worked at the Kovall tobacco factory and was soon elected as a member of the executive committee of the tobacco factory union. He was a skilled political agitator and propagandist. Because he resolutely fought for the interests of the workers, he often suffered persecution and arrest by the government. In September 1936, he fled from Lastrati to Crete Island and actively engaged in the struggle against the pro-royalist fascist dictatorship. In 1938, he was arrested again and imprisoned in a concentration camp. He did not escape from the concentration camp until 1941.
　　After being released from prison, he immediately organized the people's resistance movement and established the first unit of the People's Liberation Army in the mountains. He is very shrewd and talented, with extremely high working ability. When he served as the commander of the 10th Division of the People's Liberation Army, he showed himself to be a very capable commander. His 10th Division was brave and good at fighting, making the enemy tremble with fear. Between the summer and autumn of 1944, he assembled several divisions to form the Macedonian Army Group and personally took command. In October 1944, the army group defeated the German fascist security battalion and liberated Thessaloniki. In October 1946, he was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Greek Democratic Army. Recently, with the establishment of the Greek Provisional People's Democratic Government, he was also appointed as Prime Minister and Minister of the Army. (Lin)
