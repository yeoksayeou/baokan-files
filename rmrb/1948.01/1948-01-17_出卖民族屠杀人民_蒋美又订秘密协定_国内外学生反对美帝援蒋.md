　　Selling out the Nation and Massacring the People
  　Chiang and the US Sign Another Secret Agreement
    Students at Home and Abroad Oppose US Imperialist Aid to Chiang
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: According to the Associated Press, Chiang Kai-shek and US imperialism signed another secret agreement on November 20 to massacre the Chinese people. The agreement stipulates that the United States will sell 250 aircraft to Chiang Kai-shek, establish aircraft repair factories in Chiang Kai-shek's controlled areas, and the US imperialists will supplement equipment for Chiang Kai-shek's airports in various places. According to this agreement, a group of American personnel will come to China with Mao Bangchu, whom Chiang Kai-shek sent to the United States.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: (Delayed news) Students at home and abroad unanimously oppose American imperialism's aid to Chiang Kai-shek. According to Lin Bao Luo, Secretary-General of the Chinese Christian Student Association in North America, in late September of last year, more than a hundred students studying in the United States gathered on the shores of Lake Geneva in Wisconsin to protest the Kuomintang government's trampling of the Chinese people's civil rights and demanded that the US government stop financial and military aid to the Kuomintang. Another meeting of students held in Conferens, Connecticut, passed resolutions demanding that the United States stop aiding the Kuomintang's civil war, abolish the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty," oppose any peace treaty with Japan that would aid Japan in restoring its pre-war aggression, and oppose American discrimination against Chinese people in the United States. Furthermore: In October of last year, the All-China Student Federation sent a letter to American students, calling on them to fight to stop the US government's continued aid to the Kuomintang. The letter pointed out that the Chinese civil war is the result of American aid to Chiang Kai-shek's aggression against China. Without American aid, the Kuomintang would be unable to continue fighting. It also firmly stated that Chinese students will fight to the end for China's independence, democracy, and peace.
