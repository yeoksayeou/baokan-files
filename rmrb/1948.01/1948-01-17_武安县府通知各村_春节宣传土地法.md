Wu'an County Government Notifies Villages to Promote Land Law During Spring Festival
[Wu'an News] In order to cooperate with the upcoming movement of the great land redistribution review, the Wu'an County Government notified all primary school teachers in the county on the 13th of this month to prepare for this year's Lunar New Year entertainment. The notice pointed out that the content of this year's propaganda should focus on the Outline Land Law, so that all farmers in the countryside know the program for the equitable distribution of land. Secondly, from a positive perspective, we should publicize the victory of our army and the current counter-offensive situation. In terms of the form of propaganda, primary school teachers throughout the county are called upon to write and create a large number of快板 (kuaiban - rhythmic talking),秧歌 (yangge - folk dance), and short plays based on the specified propaganda content and combined with the specific situation of the villages. All theater troupes in the county, or rural theater troupes that do not go out, are called upon to perform new plays during the Lunar New Year. The notice emphasized that this year's New Year's entertainment, both in form and content, should make the masses willing to watch and listen. Propaganda materials should also be collected from the masses, and attention must be paid to the demands of the poor and hired peasants, and their emotions must be reflected. The county has established a system for reviewing scripts and various propaganda entertainment programs. All programs to be performed during the Lunar New Year must be reviewed and approved before they can be performed. (Wen Shan)
