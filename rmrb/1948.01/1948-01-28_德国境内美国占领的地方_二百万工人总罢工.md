　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 26th: Berlin dispatch: In the state of Bavaria, within the U.S.-occupied territory of Germany, a 24-hour general strike of two million workers erupted at midnight on the 22nd. This has brought the number of strikers in the British and American-occupied territories of Germany to over 2.25 million, which the Associated Press calls "the largest strike in Germany since the war." Factories in twenty-six cities and dozens of towns in Bavaria have stopped working, and all trains and military traffic in the state have come to a standstill. With the exception of water, gas, and food supplies essential for life, everything is at a standstill. Union leaders have warned the authorities that if their negotiations with the authorities regarding the resolution of the food crisis fail, then the anti-hunger strike will continue. The strike leaders also criticized the authorities for encouraging factory owners to hoard food and openly violate food laws. On the 23rd, 90,000 workers in Munich, the capital of Bavaria, held a grand demonstration at the former Hitler fascist parade ground, and marched in formation, shouting slogans such as "Demand improved food rations" and "We can't take it anymore."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 22nd: Berlin dispatch: Berlin democratic newspapers have revealed that under the guise of "exporting," the British and American joint zone is carrying out large-scale plunder of Germany. In the entire year of 1946, 23 million tons of coal were exported from the joint occupation zone, priced at only ten U.S. dollars per ton, while American coal was sold on the European market for twenty U.S. dollars per ton. Last year, even more Ruhr coal was shipped to Britain, which has therefore profited more than 500 million U.S. dollars. In terms of timber, according to unofficial estimates, more than four million tons have been shipped to Britain, priced at only two U.S. dollars per ton, which is five and a half times lower than the world market price. Up to now, the British and Americans have taken more than 1.5 million tons of scrap metal from Germany, worth 45 million U.S. dollars, and this scrap metal is usually unpaid for. A large number of textiles from the joint occupation zone have also been shipped by the United States to other countries, earning hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars, while the United States is forcing its own inferior goods on Germany. In order to eliminate future competition from German industry and ensure new markets for British exports, Britain has seized a large number of the latest precision machines. The British government itself stated that "these machines from 160 companies in the British occupation zone were not taken away as compensation."

　　德国境内美国占领的地方
  　二百万工人总罢工
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】柏林讯：德境美占区巴伐利亚州，二十二日午夜爆发了二百万工人的二十四小时总罢工。使德境英美占区罢工人数激增至二百二十五万人以上，美联社称之为“这是战后德国最大的一次罢工”。巴伐利亚州二十六个城市及数十市镇的工厂都停止了工作，全州的火车及军用交通也陷于停顿。除了生活所必需的水、煤气及食物的供应外，一切都处于静止状态。工会领袖警告当局称：假如他们与当局关于解决粮食危机的谈判失败，那末，反饥饿罢工将继续不已。罢工领袖并抨击当局怂恿厂主囤积粮食，并公开违反粮食法令。巴伐利亚州首府慕尼黑九万工人于二十三日在前希特勒法西斯检阅场举行盛大示威，并列队前进，高呼“要求改善粮食配给”、“我们不能再忍受”等口号。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】柏林讯：柏林民主报纸纷纷揭露英美联合区在“输出”的烟幕下，对德国进行大肆掠夺。在一九四六年全年，从联合占区输出煤达二千三百万吨，每吨仅给价十美元，而美国煤在欧洲市场上出售每吨则为二十美元。去年鲁尔煤更大量的被运往英国，英国因此已获利五亿美元以上。在木材方面，据非官方估计，已有四百万吨以上被输往英国，每吨价格仅二美元，比世界市场价低五倍半。到现在为止，英美自德国运走的碎金属在一百五十万吨以上，价值四千五百万美元，这些碎金属是通常不付钱的。联合占区的大量纺织品，也被美国输往其它国家而获利数亿美元，同时美国却把自己的烂货强卖给德国。英国为了消除德国工业未来的竞赛，以保证英国出口的新市场，尽量攫取了大量最新式的精细机器，英国政府自己供称：“英占区一百六十家公司的这种机器，不是因赔偿而运走的。”
