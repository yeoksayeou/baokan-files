Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th: Under the leadership of the Inner Mongolia Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, the land reform movement and various construction works in Inner Mongolia have developed rapidly in the past year. In this grassland, which stretches east from Hinggan League, west to Xilingol League, south from Jirem League, and north to Hulunbuir, encompassing twelve leagues, seventy-nine banners, and two million people, the vast number of hired peasants and herdsmen, after settling accounts and seeking revenge against feudal nobles and landlord-herdowners, have weakened and struck at feudal forces and become the masters of Inner Mongolia. On October 25th of last year, the people of the West Khorchin Rear Banner held a full-banner mass struggle meeting, overthrowing over fifty feudal despots, including the feudal leader and major Mongolian traitor Shou Ming'a, hereditary banner chief Bayin Namuer, and imperial relative Su Kehtu. The Mongolian traitor and Chiang Kai-shek special agent "Prince" Delegerli and the major despot "Prince" Ye of the West Khorchin Central Banner were also thoroughly defeated under the high hatred of the people of the entire banner. According to incomplete statistics from thirteen districts of the Dorbod Front Banner: more than 2,700 feudal despots and landlords have been overthrown, and 94,000 hectares of land, more than 29,000 houses, more than 12,000 livestock, and more than 3,000 plows have returned to the hands of 13,183 hired peasants and poor farmers, with an average of 5 hectares of land, one and a half houses, and livestock, farm tools, and clothing per household.

After the emancipation of the farmers and herdsmen, production is very active, and agriculture, industry, and commerce are becoming increasingly prosperous. Collective salt transportation, haymaking, and mutual labor exchange have become a common practice. Many places have established cooperatives and factories for iron, wood, leather, soap, wool weaving, and livestock farms. Ulanhot (i.e., Wangye Temple), the capital of Inner Mongolia, has more than 1,400 stores and several large shopping malls. Many small stores can earn more than 7,000 yuan a day (each yuan is equivalent to 25 yuan of Kuomintang currency).

The development of education in various leagues and banners is also very rapid. In the West Khorchin Rear Banner, there were only five primary schools during the puppet Manchukuo period, but now it has developed to 115 schools with more than 3,900 students. Emancipated farmers and herdsmen in various places have sent their children to school one after another. The West Khorchin Front Banner has more than 220 schools with 9,000 students, an increase of seventeen times compared to 1946. Specialized schools in Ulanhot City include the First Branch of the Inner Mongolia Military and Political University, the Second Branch of the Military and Political University in Qiqihar, the Mongolian Autonomous School in Chifeng, the branch school of the Autonomous School in Lindong, and eight institutions including the Higher Institute, Industrial Institute, and Inner Mongolia Medical College in Hailar. Secondary schools include Ulanhot Municipal Middle School, Solun Youth School, and Zalantun Naven Middle School. In the large-scale mass movement last year, a large number of students from various schools went to the countryside to participate in work. The youth movement, with the Inner Mongolia People's Revolutionary Youth League as its backbone, has also expanded from cities and schools to the peasant and herdsmen masses. Each banner and district has an organization of the Youth League, and there are now more than 3,000 members.

Cultural publishing undertakings have also experienced unprecedented development in the past year. The Han Chinese "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Daily" in Ulanhot City has been changed from an every-other-day publication to the "Inner Mongolia Daily." In addition, there is the Mongolian "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Daily," the "Hulunbuir New News" in Hailar, and the "Prairie Road" and "Education Semimonthly" in the West Khorchin Central Banner, the "Warrior News" in Jirem League, the "Advance News" of the Inner Mongolia Self-Defense Army, the "Emancipation News" of the Gorlos Banner, and the "Mass Ten-Day Publication" of the Morin Dawa Banner.

Under the leadership and call of Chairman Yunze, medical research institutes or clinics have been established successively in the West Khorchin Rear and Central Banners, Dorbod Banner, Naven Muren League, and other places, and simple treatment centers have been set up in each district. Ulanhot City has specifically established a medical college, a medical personnel training institute, a health technology research institute, and a Lama medical school. In the past, most people suffering from infectious diseases have received treatment.

　　一年来的新内蒙建设
    【新华社东北十五日电】在中共内蒙古工作委员会和内蒙古自治政府领导下的内蒙古，去年土地改革运动和各种建设工作，发展极快。在此东起兴安盟、西至锡林郭勒盟、南自哲里木盟、北达呼伦贝尔包括十二个盟、七十九个旗，二百万人口的草原上，广大的雇贫农和牧民，经过向封建贵族和地主牧主进行清算复仇斗争后，已削弱和打击了封建势力，做了内蒙的主人。西科后旗人民去年十月二十五日曾经召开全旗人民大斗争会，把封建头子、大蒙奸寿明阿和世袭旗长巴音那木尔、皇亲苏克图等五十多个封建恶霸一齐斗倒。西科中旗蒙奸蒋特“王爷”德勒格尔利大恶霸叶“王爷”等，也在全旗人民的高度仇恨下被彻底打垮。据都尔罗斯前旗十三个区的不完全统计：已有二千七百多封建恶霸地主被斗倒，有九万四千垧土地，二万九千多间房子，一万二千多匹牲口，三千多付犁杖回到了一万三千一百八十三家的雇贫农手里，平均每家可得到五垧地，一间半房子及牲畜农具衣服等。
    农牧民翻身后，生产非常积极，农工商业均日趋繁荣，集体运盐，打洋草，互相变工，已成为风气。许多地方已成立合作社和铁、木、皮革、肥皂、毛织等工厂和家畜牧场。内蒙首府乌兰浩特市（即王爷庙）有一千四百多家商店，和几个大商场。许多小商店，每天都可盈利七千多元左右（每元合蒋币二十五元）。
    各盟旗的教育发展也很快。西科后旗在伪满时候，只有五所小学校，现已发展到一百十五所，有学生三千九百多人，各地翻身农民牧民，都纷纷送子弟入学。西科前旗有学校二百二十多所，学生九千人，比一九四六年增加了十七倍。专科学校乌兰浩特市有内蒙军政大学第一院，齐齐哈尔有军政大学第二院，赤峰有蒙古自治学校，林东有自治学校分校，和海拉尔的高等学院，工业学院，内蒙医学院等八处。中等学校有乌兰浩特市立中学，索伦青年学校，扎兰屯纳文中学等。在去年大规模的群众运动中，各校学生都大批的下乡参加工作。以内蒙人民革命青年团为骨干的青年运动，也已从城市和学校扩大到农民牧民群众中去，各旗各区，都有青年团的组织，现在已有团员三千多人。
    文化出版事业，在过去一年中也有空前的发展。乌兰浩特市的汉文“内蒙自治报”已由隔日刊改为“内蒙古日报”。此外还有蒙文的“内蒙自治报”，海拉尔的“呼伦贝尔新报”，和西科中旗“草原之路”“教育半月刊”，哲里木盟的“战士报”，内蒙自卫军的“挺进报”，郭尔罗斯旗的“翻身报”，莫力达瓦旗的“大众旬刊”等。
    卫生事业，在云泽主席的领导和号召下，西科后、中两旗，杜尔伯特旗，纳文慕仁盟等地都已先后成立医学研究所或诊疗所，每个区并设有简易治疗所。乌兰浩特市专门开办了医学院，医务人员养成所，卫生技术研究所和喇嘛医学校等，过去大多数害传染病的人都得到了救治。
