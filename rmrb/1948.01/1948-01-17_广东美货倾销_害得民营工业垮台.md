　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Jiang-controlled area newspapers reveal that the crisis in Guangdong's national industry is unprecedentedly serious. According to statistics from the Jiang bandit provincial government: 215 privately-owned factories have been approved to resume operations, and along with those in the process of registering, there are approximately 400 (about one-fifth of the pre-war number). By July of last year, fewer than 100 could barely maintain operations, less than 5% of the pre-war number of factories, and most of them were on the verge of collapse. Of the province's five major private industries—textiles, rubber, cigarettes, matches, and sugar manufacturing—there were nearly a thousand factories of all sizes after the Japanese surrender. Currently, only 86 (including some unregistered small factories, same below) are still struggling to ship goods regularly, less than one-tenth of the original number. Other more important industries such as rice milling, oil refining, brewing, and chemical manufacturing, have fewer than five surviving enterprises in each category, and most are operating at a loss. The most important reason for the crisis in Guangdong's private industry is the dumping of American goods. The province is adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, making it one of the major concentration areas for smuggling by the Four Big Families, thus inflicting deep damage on the province's private industry. In other news: Qingdao Xinhua and four other match factories announced their closure in the middle of last month due to their inability to sustain operations. The thirteen factories of the bureaucratic capital's China Textile Corporation in Qingdao also simultaneously ceased operations. The 20,000 workers in these thirteen factories have fallen into dire unemployment, affecting as many as 100,000 family members.

　　广东美货倾销
  　害得民营工业垮台
    【新华社陕北十三日电】蒋区报纸披露：广东民族工业危机空前严重。据该省蒋匪省府统计：民营工厂经核准复业者有二百十五家，连同在登记中者约有四百家左右（此数约为战前的五分之一），至去年七月间能勉强维持营业者已不足百家，不及战前工厂数百分之五，且其中大部均已临倒闭危机。该省纺织、橡胶、卷烟、火柴、制糖五大民营工业，日本投降后共有大小工厂近千家，目前仍能勉强挣扎经常出货者仅有八十六家（包括一部分没有登记的小型工厂在内，以下同），不及原数十分之一。其他较重要工业如碾米、炼油、酿造、化学制造等，每种工业残存者均不足五家，且多亏损。造成广东民营工业危机的最重要原因，是美货倾销，该省毗连港澳，为四大家族走私的大集中地之一，因而给予该省民营工业深重打击。另息：青岛新华等五家火柴厂因无法维持，于上月中宣告歇业。官僚资本之中纺公司在青岛的十三个工厂亦于同时全部停工。该十三工厂两万工人陷于失业惨境，被牵连工人眷属达十万人之多。
