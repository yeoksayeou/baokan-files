Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th – Industries in Qingdao, within the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, are increasingly grinding to a halt due to a lack of raw materials and fuel. According to the Chiang Kai-shek Social Bureau Chief of the city, during a "Labor-Management Appraisal Conference," many factories in the city from all sectors have been requesting shutdowns or reductions in scale. In the latter half of December alone, around the solar new year, the bureau approved the shutdowns of six dyeing and weaving factories, four match factories, and two factories that were rotating shutdowns or reducing their scale, with four more cases under investigation and processing. Furthermore, it was revealed during a Chiang Kai-shek Qingdao City Council meeting that the thirteen factories belonging to the Chiang Kai-shek bureaucratic capital China Textile Industries Corporation were also experiencing fuel shortages, and at one point implemented a rotating shutdown system, with each factory operating only four days at a time to barely stay afloat. However, by December 23rd of the previous year, they had all ceased operations as a result.

　　青岛工厂纷纷关门
    【新华社陕北二十日电】蒋区青岛工业已在缺乏原料燃料下纷纷陷于停顿。据该市蒋匪社会局长在“劳资评断会”上供称：近来该市各业工厂请求停工或缩小范围者甚多，仅阳历年关十二月下旬经该局核准停工者计染织业六家，火柴业四家，轮流停工及缩小范围者二家，正调查处理者四家。另据蒋匪青岛参议会上透露：蒋官僚资本中纺公司所属十三个工厂，亦因燃料恐慌，一度实行轮流停工办法，每厂四天轮开一次，以苟延残喘，至年前十二月二十三日终因此全部停工。
