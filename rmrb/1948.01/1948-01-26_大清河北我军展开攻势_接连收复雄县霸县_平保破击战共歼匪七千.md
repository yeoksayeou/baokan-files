Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 24th: Our army has launched an offensive operation north of the Daqing River. On the evening of the 18th, we once again liberated Xiong County, about 90 li northeast of Baoding, annihilating a part of the bandit security brigade. On the 19th, our army continued to advance northeast, immediately recovering Jiugang (20 li northeast of Xiong County), Daying (20 li north of Xiong County), Shakou (40 li north of Xiong County), Banjiawo (35 li northeast of Xiong County), Kaikou (15 li west of Xinzhen), Niutuo (20 li southwest of Yongqing), Nanmeng (15 li north of Ba County), Chaheji (10 li west of Ba County), Maoerwan (15 li southwest of Xinzhen) and other villages and towns. On the 21st, Ba County was successively recovered. All the Chiang Kai-shek puppet fortifications north of the Daqing River were completely cleared by our forces. Detailed battle results are currently being investigated. Currently, a vast area north of the Daqing River, east to Anci and Shengfang, west to the east bank of the Daqing River, north to the south bank of the Yongding River, and south between Xiong County and Xinzhen, has been liberated once again.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 23rd: A front-line reporter commented on this great victory on the northern front, saying: Just as Fu Zuoyi took office as the "Commander-in-Chief for Communist Suppression" in North China, our Jin-Cha-Ji forces, in coordination with the Northeast Liberation Army's winter offensive, launched a large-scale raiding war centered on Pingjin and Baoding around the New Year. Following our army's sweeping of the outposts around Baoding with a part of our forces on the 7th and 8th, directly approaching the suburbs of Baoding, Fu Zuoyi urgently adjusted the Third Army, the Ninety-Fourth Army, the Sixteenth Army, and two divisions of the Thirty-Fifth Army to move south along the west side of the Pingbao line to relieve the siege, suffering more than 4,000 casualties along the way. Having just arrived in Baoding and not yet catching his breath, our northern route army suddenly launched a fierce attack on Laishui city at dusk on the 11th, quickly occupying the four gates. Bandit Fu urgently dispatched the New Thirty-Second Division and the 101st Division of the Thirty-Fifth Army to aid northward overnight. On the 12th, the New Thirty-Second Division had just advanced to Zhuangtuan and the north-south Yian line, more than ten li east of the city, when it was surrounded by our army. From the late night of the 12th, after 16 hours of fierce fighting, more than 2,000 men of the New Thirty-Second Division were completely annihilated, and the division commander, Li Mingding, was also killed by our forces. The 101st Division, another reinforcement, was also annihilated and captured by our forces in the Wucun and Gaoluo areas, more than ten li northwest of Dingxing, suffering more than 600 casualties. In addition, the Provisional 17th Division, which had rushed from the Ping-Sui Railway to reinforce, was also killed and wounded, with 500 men killed by our forces near Songlin Town, and fled in panic to Xincheng. In total, more than 7,000 enemies were annihilated in the entire campaign. When the Provisional Third Army, the Sixteenth Army, the Ninety-Fourth Army and other units turned around from Baoding to reinforce and relieve the siege, the battle had already ended victoriously. Bandit Fu's "so brilliant" "art of command" can truly be described as "Wu Dalang playing with a pole, unable to reach either end." In the past half month, the People's Liberation Army has taken the initiative to fight everywhere, while Fu Zuoyi has dragged his troops around. He originally used the non-direct line Sixteenth Army and Ninety-Fourth Army to bear the brunt, but instead made his main force, the two divisions of the Thirty-Fifth Army, collapse, with some being annihilated and others being severely damaged. Bandit Fu suffered this disastrous defeat not long after taking office, so he fabricated battle results and boasted wildly, thinking he could cover up his shame, so the rumor company Central News Agency has been shouting desperately in recent days. But the blow that Bandit Fu has suffered this time is only the beginning, and a series of heavy blows will follow one after another.

　　大清河北我军展开攻势
  　接连收复雄县霸县
  　平保破击战共歼匪七千
    【新华社晋察冀前线二十四日电】大清河北我军展开攻势作战。十八日晚再度解放保定东北约九十里之雄县城，歼匪保安大队一部。十九日我军继向东北挺进，当即收复咎岗（雄县东北二十里）、大营（雄县北二十里）、沙口（雄县北四十里）、板家窝（雄县东北三十五里）、开口（新镇西十五里）、牛驼（永清西南二十里）、南孟（霸县北十五里）、岔河集（霸县西十里）、毛尔湾（新镇西南十五里）等村镇。二十一日相继收复霸县。大清河北蒋伪工事被我悉数扫平。详细战果正清查中。现大清河北东至安次、胜芳，西至大清河东岸，北至永定河南岸，南至雄县、新镇之间广大地区，重告解放。
    【新华社晋察冀前线二十三日电】前线记者评论此次北线大捷称：正当傅作义就任华北“剿共总司令”之际，晋察冀我军便配合东北解放军冬季攻势于新年前后发动以平津保为中心的大规模破击战，继于七八两日我军以一部扫清保定外围据点，直逼保定城郊，傅作义乃急调整三军、九十四军、十六军及三十五军两个师沿平保线西侧南下解围，沿途遭我毙伤四千余人。刚赶到保定喘息未已，北路我军突于十一日黄昏向涞水城发动猛攻，迅速占领四关。傅匪急调三十五军新三十二师、一○一师星夜北援，十二日新三十二师刚进至城东十余里之庄疃及南北义安一线，即被我大军包围，从十二日深夜起，经十六小时激战，新三十二师二千余人全部就歼，师长李铭鼎亦被我击毙。而另路援兵一○一师亦于定兴西北十里之吴村、高洛一带遭我歼俘其六百余人。另由平绥路赶来增援之暂十七师亦在松林店附近被我击毙五百余人，狼狈窜至新城。全役共歼敌七千余人。等到暂三军、十六军、九十四军等部由保定扭转屁股前来增援解围时，战斗早已胜利结束。傅匪“如此高明”的“指挥艺术”，真可谓“武大郎盘杠子两头够不着”。半月来解放军处处主动作战，而傅作义却把部队拖来拖去，他本来是用非嫡系十六军、九十四军来挡头阵，结果反把自己的主力三十五军两个师弄得溃不成军，被歼的被歼，受创的受创。傅匪登台不久，遭此惨败，于是捏造战果大肆吹嘘，以为自己遮羞，因而谣言公司中央社连日来就提高嗓子拼命叫嚣。但傅匪此次所遭打击，还只是开始，一连串沉重的打击，将会接踵而至。
