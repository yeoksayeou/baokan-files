　　International Week
    (January 19th to 25th)
    This week, more exciting good news came from Europe. In Britain, the movement against the Marshall Plan of enslavement is continuing to unfold. The British Communist Party continues to achieve significant victories in the trade union anti-communist re-elections instigated by the reactionary Labor authorities. In the re-election of the Transport and General Workers' Union, where Bevin made his name, several prominent members of the British Communist Party were re-elected to the executive committee of the union. In the re-election of the Manchester Trade Union Council, workers responded to the shameless clamor of certain reactionary Labor leaders in the union who forbade members of the British Communist Party from being elected by electing a member of the British Communist Party as chairman of the union. Similar things happened in the re-elections of many other local unions. The anti-communist activities carried out by the Labor authorities in accordance with the will of the "Marshall Plan" have not only been spurned by the broad masses of British workers, but have also aroused dissatisfaction and opposition within the Labor Party. Advanced elements such as Simpson from the Scottish branch of the Labor Party resigned in anger to join the British Communist Party. The above facts have demonstrated the growing prestige of the British Communist Party and the weakening of the Labor Party's mass base.
    The facts of the week further show that the Labor government has resolved to further sell itself to the United States. The Labor authorities completely listen to the will of the American masters, revising their production plans and export plans "to comply with the will of the Marshall Plan and American monopolists" (TASS). The shipbuilding program, on which exports depend, has been greatly reduced. This traitorous policy has stirred up waves of resistance among the broad masses of workers, and the British working class is preparing to launch a widespread protest movement.
    The democratic united front of the Italian working people is becoming more consolidated. Following the Sixth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party, the Italian Socialist Party, another major party of the Italian working class, held its 26th National Congress on the 20th of this month. In his report, the party's General Secretary Basso expressed his intention to abide by the agreement on unified action in all aspects between the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party. This reflects that this Socialist Party congress is a congress that further strengthens unity with the Communist Party. The close cooperation between the two largest parties in Italy, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, is a major guarantee that the Italian people's democratic movement will achieve victory.
    The anger of workers in the western occupied areas of Germany against hunger is like a prairie fire. The strike wave, which has continued for two weeks in the British zone, has now quickly swept through the American zone. More than two million workers in Bavaria in the American zone have formally announced a general strike to protest the "unbearable" food rations. At the same time, the just calls and activities of the entire German people demanding peace and unity in Germany echo the strike struggles in the western occupied areas. The increasingly awakened strength of the German people has dealt a heavy blow to the conspiracy of American imperialism to split and enslave Germany.
    The domestic democratic movement in the United States is also growing. The Progressive Citizens of America held its Second National Congress on the 18th, resolving to promote the establishment of a new party and support Wallace as a presidential candidate. Local unions of the CIO have also expressed their support for Wallace. According to Foster, a leader of the American Communist Party, "the new third party will awaken millions of voters who are disappointed in the Democratic and Republican parties." This proves that the establishment of the new party reflects the demands and emotions of the broad progressive people of the United States, and also reflects their deep-seated hatred of the evil policies of the Democratic and Republican "two-party system." At the same time, prominent figures in the American education and science communities recently announced the establishment of a "Committee of One Thousand" to fight for the abolition of the reactionary "Un-American Activities Committee." Many scientists and educators, led by the famous physicist Einstein, have also spoken out against military interference in politics. Under the impact of the increasingly powerful American democratic forces, the reactionary American authorities were frightened and lost their composure, even taking off the so-called "democratic" sheepskin gloves and revealing a pair of blood-stained fascist poisonous hands, openly destroying democracy and human rights, and arbitrarily arresting Pittman and Jones, leaders of the American Communist Party. This is bound to add fuel to the growing people's movement in the United States, and the American Communist Party has called on the people of the whole country to rise up in support and fight to not replace the reactionary Attorney General.

　　国际一周
    （一月十九日至二十五日）
    这一周，欧洲又传来了许多令人兴奋的好消息。在英国，反对马歇尔奴役计划的运动，正继续展开。英共在工党反动当局所策动的职工会反共改选中，继续获得重大的胜利。在贝文赖以起家的运输业及各业工人工会改选中，英共数名著名党员再度荣任该工会执委。在曼彻斯特工会委员会改选中，工人们以选举英共党员为该工会主席，来答复该工会某些工党反动头子不准英共党员当选的无耻叫嚣。在其它许多地方工会的改选中，也有类此的事情。工党当局秉承“马歇尔计划”的意志而作的反共活动，不仅遭到英国广大工人群众的唾弃，而且引起了工党内部的不满与反对。工党苏格兰地方支部的先进分子辛浦生等，愤而自动脱离该党加入英共。上述各项事实，已说明了英共威信的增长，和工党群众基础的越发削弱。
    一周来的事实更加显示：工党政府已决心进一步向美国卖身投靠。工党当局完全听从美国主子的意志，修改其生产方案与输出计划，“以符合于马歇尔计划和美国垄断家们的意志”（塔斯社）。赖以出口的造船业计划，已经被大大削减。这种卖国政策已在广大工人中掀起了反抗的波澜，英国工人阶级正准备发动一个广泛的抗议运动。
    意大利劳动人民的民主统一战线更趋巩固。继意共六次全国代表大会后，意工人阶级的另一大党社会党，于本月二十日举行了该党第二十六届全国代表大会。该党总书记巴苏在报告中，表示注守意共、社二党在一切方面统一行动的协定。这反映了这次社会党大会，是更进一步与共产党加强团结的大会。意大利两个最大政党共产党与社会党的密切合作，是意国人民民主运动必将取得胜利的重大保证。
    德国西部占领区工人反饥饿怒火，有如燎原之势。英占区继续二周的罢工浪潮，现已迅速席卷美占区。美占区巴伐利亚的二百余万工人为抗议“不能再忍受”的粮食配给已正式宣布大罢工。同时，全德人民要求德国和平及统一的正义呼声与活动，也与西部占领区的罢工斗争交相辉映。德国人民日益觉醒的力量，已使美帝国主义分裂和奴役德国的阴谋受到沉重的打击。
    美国国内的民主运动，也在增长中。美国进步公民协会于十八日举行了第二届全国代表大会，决议促使新党的建立，并拥护华莱士为总统候选人。产联各地方工会亦纷纷表示支持华莱士。据美共领袖福斯特说：“新的第三党将唤起数百万对民主、共和二党失望的投票者”。这证明新党的建立，是反映了美国广大进步人民的要求和情绪，亦反映了它们对民主、共和的“两党制”恶政，抱着如何深恶痛绝的态度。与此同时，美著名教育界与科学家最近亦宣布成立“千人委员会”，为取消反动的“非美活动委员会”而斗争。以著名物理学家爱因斯坦为首的许多科学家及教育界人士，也发言反对军人干政。美反动当局在日趋强大的美国民主势力的冲击下，惊惶失色，竟不惜脱掉了所谓“民主”的羊皮手套，露出了一双血淋淋的法西斯毒手，公开摧毁民主与人权，将美共领袖之一毕特曼及琼斯横加逮捕。这势将为正在增长的美国的人民运动火上加油，美共已号召全国人民起而声援并未撤换反动的司法部长而斗争。
