Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. International Week – January 5th – 11th.

　　This week's international news foreshadows that the coming year will be a year in which the democratic anti-imperialist camp will achieve greater victories in various parts of the world, especially in the Far East and Western Europe.

　　The revolutionary teacher of the Chinese people—Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's report "On the Current Situation and Our Tasks" is currently spreading around the world. This report summarizes the great experience of China's victorious war of self-defense and land reform over the past year or so. It not only indicates clear goals for the people of the whole country, but also has great guiding and inspiring effects on the entire East and the world. In the future, the national liberation movements in the Eastern colonies will move towards a path of victory under the guidance of this great document. American imperialism and its running dogs have been alarmed by this. The most reactionary Howard newspaper exclaimed that this report is "more significant" than the establishment of the Greek democratic government and Wallace's independent participation in the presidential election.

　　In Eastern European countries such as South, Czech and Poland, last year's production plans have been completed, and they are organizing forces to strive for greater achievements in political and economic aspects this year. Romania abandoned the monarchy before the new year and announced the official establishment of the People's Democratic Republic. This is another brilliant achievement of the new democratic revolution of the 16 million Romanian people. In Bulgaria, the Fatherland Front published a new draft charter, defining the Fatherland Front as a single political organization and transforming it into a broad democratic anti-imperialist united front led by the working class. This is a major event and a reliable guarantee for Bulgaria's transition to a socialist society. The above three points show that the people of Eastern Europe are preparing various conditions in order to embark on the most happy socialist society of mankind.

　　In the past week, the people of the whole of Germany have been swept into a wave of "struggle for the democratic unification of Germany." People's congresses have been held in various states, counties and even villages in the Soviet-occupied zone. In the western American, British and French occupied zones, the German Communist Party is launching a heroic struggle to organize the "Democratic National Front." The People's Congress of Western Germany is also actively preparing. Regardless of the obstruction and sabotage of the occupying authorities and their running dogs such as Schumacher, this struggle for German democratic unification has still won the widespread support of lower-level workers and party members of the Social Democratic Party and other working people. This movement will undoubtedly make the American and British imperialist reactionary activities of splitting Germany and organizing the "West German government" completely isolated among the German people, and ultimately lead to failure.

　　The democratic struggle in Europe maintains an even more magnificent scale in Italy. The Italian Communist Party held its Sixth National Congress on the 5th. This is another major event following the establishment of the Italian People's Democratic Front on December 28th last year. This marks a new upsurge in the Italian democratic anti-imperialist movement. The Italian People's Democratic Front has accepted the experiences and lessons of the People's Fronts in France, Spain, and Yugoslavia in the past. Now it is not a union between the leading organs of various political parties, but a mass organization that unites Italian workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other democratic patriots. It is a new form of unity and common struggle of democratic forces. It is led by the consistent actions of the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party, and based on the close unity of workers and peasants. This provides the necessary guarantee for the victory of the Italian people's movement for independence, democracy and freedom. In this situation, the Sixth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party is undoubtedly a meeting to prepare for victory. Togliatti, in his report to the congress, declared with confidence in victory: "All our goals will be achieved by legal means, but if our enemies want to use force, we are prepared to deal with them in the same way."

　　At the same time, a new wave of strikes has swept across Italy. On the 5th and 6th, the local garrison troops in major cities across the country went on strike and held demonstrations to protest the chaotic order to postpone demobilization. Bloody clashes occurred everywhere. Currently, there are hundreds of thousands of strikers, and the trend continues to expand.

　　A new struggle of the French working class is also brewing. The activities of American imperialism and the French Socialist Party traitors to split the General Confederation of Labor have further promoted the unity of the French working class. The vast majority of trade union organizations remain loyal to the General Confederation of Labor, and the number of new workers joining the General Confederation of Labor is constantly increasing. In response to a series of reactionary measures taken by the French-American authorities in the new year (huge military budget, increased taxes, increased prices, French-American traitorous agreement, etc.), the General Confederation of Labor issued a call on the 7th, demanding that the working class prepare to fight for new wage rates. The General Confederation of Agriculture and small and medium-sized manufacturers also participated in the struggle against the new tax. On the 5th, there was a demonstration of 20,000 film workers in Paris, and on the 6th, many shops in the Paris area announced a strike. On the 7th, small businessmen in Paris also held a mass rally to protest the French government's reactionary tax law. These events foreshadow that a new storm is coming.

　　Around the New Year, the British working class also launched a struggle against the Labor Party authorities' splitting of the workers' movement and clamoring against communism. The advanced section of the British working class responded to Philip's anti-communist statement on December 22nd last year and Attlee's anti-communist and anti-Soviet speech on the 3rd of this month with widespread and fierce protest movements. Anti-protest meetings were held in trade unions everywhere, expressing their trust in the leadership of the British Communist Party in trade unions. The five British Communist Party executive committee members of the South Wales Executive Committee of the National Union of Mineworkers were re-elected under the Labor Party's instigation of re-election. As a result of the re-election of the Transport and General Workers' Union, on which Bevan relied to build his career, the British Communist Party won many important positions. For example, British Communist Party member Jones was elected as the chairman of the London First District Passenger Transport Committee (65,000 members) and the Central Bus Committee (36,000 members). On the 5th, when the British Communist Party's Workers' Daily celebrated its 18th anniversary, the number of worker representatives participating in the grand ceremony reached 60,000. Obviously, the advanced section of the British working class is breaking away from the influence of the Labor Party's reactionary authorities and turning to support the leadership of the British Communist Party, the true representative of its own class.

### 从这一周看今年民主反帝阵营将获更大胜利

　　从这一周看今年
  　民主反帝阵营将获更大胜利
    【新华社陕北十二日电】国际一周——一月五日——十一日。
    这一周的国际新闻，预告着今后的一年，将是民主反帝阵营在世界各地，尤其是远东与西欧，取得更大胜利的一年。
    中国人民的革命导师——中共中央毛主席的“论目前形势和我们的任务”报告，目前在世界各地传播着。这报告总结了中国一年多来胜利的自卫战争与土地改革的伟大经验，不但向全国人民指示了明确的奋斗目标，而且对全东方全世界都有极大的指导与鼓舞作用。今后，东方各殖民地民族解放运动将在这伟大文件照耀下，走向胜利的坦途。美国帝国主义及其走狗们已对此惊慌失措。最反动的霍华德系报纸，就惊呼说：这一报告，比之希腊民主政府的成立和华莱士独立参加总统竞选，“意义更为重大”。
    在东欧南、捷、波等国都完成了去年的生产计划，并正组织力量，为争取今年政治经济方面的更大成就而斗争。罗马尼亚在年前废弃了君主皇朝，宣布了人民民主共和国的正式建立，这是一千六百万罗国人民新民主革命的另一辉煌成就。在保加利亚，祖国阵线发表了新的章程草案，确定祖国阵线为单一的政治组织，把它变成为以工人阶级为领导的广泛的民主反帝统一战线，这是一件大事，是保国过渡到社会主义的可靠保证。上述三项，显示：东欧人民正在准备各种条件，以便走上人类最幸福的社会主义社会。
    一周来全德人民卷入了“为德国的民主统一而斗争”的浪潮。苏占领区各州，各县甚至各村均已召开了人民代表大会。西部美英法占领区内，德国共产党正在为组织“民主民族阵线”而展开了英勇的斗争。西部德国的人民代表大会也在积极筹备中，不管占领当局及其走狗舒马赫之流的阻难与破坏，这一为德国民主统一的斗争，仍取得了社会民主党下层工人党员及其他劳动人民的广泛支持。这一运动无疑将使美英帝国主义分裂德国，组织“西德政府”的反动活动，在德国人民中完全陷于孤立，并最后引向失败。
    欧洲的民主斗争，在意大利保持着更其雄伟的规模。意共在五日召开了六次全国代表大会，这是继去年十二月二十八日意国人民民主阵线成立大会后的另一重大事件，这标志着意国民主反帝运动的新高潮。意国的人民民主阵线，接受了过去法国、西班牙及南斯拉夫等国人民阵线的经验教训，现在已不是各政党领导机关之间的联合，而是团结了意国工人、农民、知识分子及其他民主的爱国分子的群众组织，是民主势力团结与共同斗争的新形式，它以意共与社会党的行动一致为领导，而以工人与农民的亲密团结为基础，这就使争取独立、民主和自由的意国人民运动之走向胜利，有了必要的保证。在这种情形下，意共的六大，无疑是一个准备走向胜利的大会。托格里亚蒂在大会的报告中，充满着胜利的信心宣称：“我们的一切目的，将以合法手段达成，但如我们的敌人要用武力，我们就准备采用敌人的办法来对付它。”
    与此同时，新的罢工浪潮又已席卷意大利全国。五、六两日全国各大城市的地方守备部队，爆发罢勤并举行示威，抗议延期复员的乱命。流血冲突到处发生。目前罢工者已达数十万人之众，并有继续扩大之势。
    法国工人阶级的新的斗争亦在酝酿中。美帝国主义与法国社会党叛徒分裂总工会的活动，更促进了法国工人阶级的团结。绝大多数的工会组织仍忠实于总工会，而新的加入总工会的工人数目正不断增加中。针对着法美当局新年来一连串的反动措施（庞大的军事预算，增加税收，提高物价，法美卖国协定等），总工会于七日已发出号召，要求工人阶级为争取新工资率而准备斗争，总农会与中小厂商亦参加了反对新税收的斗争，五日巴黎有两万电影从业员的示威，六日巴黎区很多商店宣告罢市，七日巴黎小商人并举行群众大会，抗议法国政府反动的税收法。这些事件，预示了新的暴风雨即将来临。
    英国工人阶级在新年前后，亦展开了反对工党当局分裂工人运动及叫嚣反共的斗争。对于菲力浦去年十二月二十二日的反共声明，及本月三日艾德礼的反共反苏演说，英国工人阶级的先进部分，报之以广泛的激烈的抗议运动。各地工会中纷纷举行抗议会议，并表示信任英共在职工会的领导。全国矿工联盟南威尔士执委会五位英共执委，在工党挑拨复选下仍再度当选。贝文赖以起家的运输业及各业工人工会改选结果，英共反而赢得了许多重要职位，如英共党员宙恩斯被选为伦敦第一区客运委员会（会员六万五千人）及公共汽车中央委员会（会员三万六千人）的主席。五日英共工人日报十八周年纪念时，参加盛典的工人代表，数达六万人。显然英国工人阶级的先进部分，正在摆脱工党反动当局的影响，而转向于拥护自己阶级的真正代表英共的领导了。
