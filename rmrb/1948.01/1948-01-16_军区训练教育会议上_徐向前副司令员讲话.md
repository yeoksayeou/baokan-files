Comrades:

　　It is not easy to convene such a large-scale regional troop training and education conference. At this conference, the military regions and columns reported and conducted self-criticisms, exchanged past experiences, and provided opinions on future work. Finally, Deputy Commander Teng gave a concluding report, and the problems that needed to be resolved were resolved. I would like to simply offer a few points for your reference.

　　The spirit of this conference is to review the implementation of the Military Commission's instructions on troop training and cadre training issued on December 24th of last year. The review showed that some units did not convey the instructions, some did not study them, and some comrades had not even seen them. This proves that some comrades' study and implementation of the Military Commission's instructions is very insufficient. While there are some objective reasons for this, and we cannot completely blame the comrades, some responsibility should be borne by the comrades themselves. You should strictly examine why we have not effectively implemented the Military Commission's instructions. Reviewing the past is mainly for the future. After everyone participates in this conference, participates in the review, and listens to Deputy Commander Teng's detailed summary report on troop training and education, you should go back and thoroughly convey this to the troops, encourage them to study meticulously, and implement conscientiously. You must earnestly take on this responsibility. Why? Because troop training and education is a very serious issue and an issue that urgently needs improvement. If the troops' soldiers and cadres are well-trained, battles can be fought well, casualties can be reduced, and victories can be achieved. If the troops are not well-trained, battles will not be fought well, the troops will suffer increased casualties, and the war will fail. Now, the troops of our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region need to intensify training even more. Our experience in large-scale mobile warfare and attacking enemy strongholds is not yet very rich; however, our task is to eliminate the enemy's remaining isolated strongholds and the surrounding remnants in our area. This task is great and arduous. To accomplish this great and arduous task, we need to greatly improve the combat effectiveness of our troops, first of all, to improve the ability to attack fortifications and conduct continuous operations. If the troops are not well-trained, combat effectiveness will not improve; on the contrary, many unnecessary sacrifices will be made. Therefore, we must adopt an extremely responsible attitude towards the people, the revolution, the Party, the soldiers, and the cadres in our troop training and education, and we must seriously treat this issue. According to the spirit of this conference, two different styles exist in our troops: one is a responsible attitude towards the war, the soldiers, and the cadres. They care about the war, care about troop training, care about the soldiers, and cherish the soldiers. This is the correct attitude and the correct style. The other is an irresponsible attitude towards the war and the soldiers. They do not care about the war, do not care about troop training, do not care about the cadres, and do not care about the soldiers. They only blindly hope for and demand victories. But how can we achieve victory? They do not bother to study it carefully. The latter style is very bad and must be overcome. We must vigorously promote the former correct style of caring about the war, caring about training, and caring about the soldiers. Therefore, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and have leaders take responsibility and do it themselves. In the past, some cadres' thinking on the issue of troop training and education was not clear, and they did not take responsibility. That was wrong. Now that the problem has been clarified, leaders at all levels must personally take responsibility. Do not be irresponsible, do not be inactive, or be falsely responsible or falsely active. Every cadre who wants to become a wise and courageous commander cannot only manage fighting battles without managing training and education. Just managing fighting battles, even if you fight well, is only fulfilling part of your duty; moreover, commanders who only manage fighting battles without managing training often do not fight well. It should be known that fighting battles well is based on training the troops well. To be a leader, one must be able to fight battles and train troops. Otherwise, one is not a good commander.

　　Many of our cadres believe that troop training and education is a temporary task. After the meeting, or during the large-scale training movement, they start doing it vigorously, and then slowly relax. Troop training and education is a regular and long-term task. As long as classes exist, as long as war exists, the army must exist. If the army wants to win battles, if it wants the revolutionary war to be victorious and eliminate the enemy, the army's education and training cannot be relaxed for a moment. Relaxing even a little will not benefit the troops or the revolution. Moreover, we are in the midst of a cruel war to overthrow American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek, so we cannot relax troop training and education even slightly.

　　We must oppose the view of cadres who are unwilling to do training and staff work. Many cadres are unwilling to do education work and staff work. This is one of the worst traditions in our troops. They think that if they do training and education work, they cannot become leaders. They think that being a teacher or a staff officer has no status and is the organization's contempt or punishment for them. This is a very bad idea, and it still exists in the troops today. In fact, being a teacher or a staff officer is not easy. Marshal Zhukov of the Soviet Red Army, who made the most outstanding contributions in the Soviet-German War, also worked as a teacher at the Red Army Academy. There is not much of a boundary between the commanders and chiefs of staff of the Soviet Red Army. Today, a commander may become a chief of staff tomorrow; a chief of staff may also be transferred to become a commander. In the past, we emphasized the cultural level of staff officers and teachers, which was certainly justified, but it also led to a deviation. How can this problem be solved when the cultural level of worker-peasant cadres has not yet been raised? I think worker-peasant cadres and intellectual cadres should be combined to run schools and do headquarters work. As long as worker-peasant cadres have rich practical experience and can speak and teach, they can become teachers. When worker-peasant cadres and intellectual cadres work together, worker-peasant cadres can improve their cultural level, and intellectuals can also combine with practice. This can help each other learn from each other and teach each other, and both sides can benefit.

　　In addition, we must oppose the tendency to oppose military work and political work. Some military cadres think that military work is my job, and political work is not my job. Some political cadres think that political work is my job, and military work is not my job. They have forgotten the unity of military work and political work and only emphasize one aspect of it. In fact, military work and political work are one job, and the goals of the two are consistent, which is to win battles. Military work commands combat, which is obviously to defeat the enemy. In order to improve the troops' combat effectiveness and class consciousness, disintegrate the enemy, and unite internally, it is necessary to carry out political work, the purpose of which is still to defeat the enemy. Only seeing military work and not seeing political work is a purely military work viewpoint; only seeing political work and not seeing military work is a purely political work viewpoint. This cannot improve the troops' combat effectiveness; on the contrary, it will weaken the troops' combat effectiveness. Generally speaking, the military is subordinate to politics. But in the army, political work serves the army and uses political work to ensure military victory, while military work and political work are still two sides of the same job. If you argue about whether military work is the main thing or political work is the main thing; or if you argue in schools about whether military time should be more or political time should be more, it is wrong. We must oppose both the purely military work viewpoint and the purely political work viewpoint. Political work is not only a matter for political cadres, military cadres must also do political work; military work is not only a matter for military cadres, political cadres must also do military work. Regardless of whether it is a military work cadre or a political work cadre, there is only a major and minor distinction between military work and political work, and there is no absolute opposing boundary.

　　Oppose empty slogans: The responsibility of leaders and leading organs is not only to issue instructions and raise calls, but also to actually lead, organize, and help the education and training of troops and schools. After the education and training plans and regulations are prescribed and issued, it is necessary to constantly supervise and inspect the implementation situation. Without supervision and inspection, all plans will inevitably form a self-flow phenomenon, often making the original plans unable to be fully realized or simply falling apart. During the inspection, it is necessary to pay attention to whether those plans are appropriate, whether they need to be revised, and issue supplementary instructions in a timely manner, exchange practical experience between various troops, solve all the difficult problems that occur, promote advantages, correct shortcomings, and enable the education and training plans to be fully realized as scheduled. We must oppose the bureaucratic style of only shouting slogans and not doing practical work, and we must oppose treating education and training work as only the work of comrades in schools and training departments, and thinking that we can ignore it. Leaders at all levels must indeed bear the burden of education and training work, not only call for action but also (12) actually participate in and guide the work, not only formulate plans but also organize regular inspections, etc. Only in this way can education and training work be done well. In the education of troops and schools, we must oppose both dogmatism and empiricism. Dogmatism and empiricism will both separate theory from practice. But we cannot oppose theory because we oppose dogmatism. Correct theory is the crystallization of practical experience and the South Needle that directs practical action. Lenin said: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary action." It can also be said that without revolutionary military theory, there can be no victory in revolutionary war. Therefore, learning theory is a very important issue. Chairman Mao taught us that learning theory is related to the success or failure of the revolution. Today, our military cadres, especially middle and senior cadres, must use their greatest efforts to study theory. Some cadres neglect the study of theory, thinking that as long as they can fight, they do not need to study theory. This tendency is very wrong. Learning and understanding Chairman Mao's revolutionary theory (including revolutionary military theory) is like using a telescope to observe the enemy's situation when we command operations. Without the help of a telescope, you cannot see the situation in the distance and become blind. It is like analyzing things that are invisible to the eye with a microscope in a laboratory. Without the help of a microscope, you cannot obtain knowledge of things that you cannot see with your eyes. Therefore, revolutionary theory is our telescope and microscope for doing things, and it is also our scientific method for doing work. Practical experience is very valuable, but when it cannot rise to become theory, experience can sometimes cause major problems. Only relying on courage to fight without studying theory will become narrow military empiricism. Dogmatism separates theory from practice, and empiricism ignores theory, both are wrong. We must study Chairman Mao's way of thinking and Chairman Mao's military theory well. Everyone can take a good look at the book "Day and Night". In "Day and Night", there are two typical military cadres of the Soviet Red Army: one is Battalion Commander Shaburov, who is a typical soldier with both wisdom and courage. One is Regiment Commander Baberchenko, who is a typical narrow empiricist with courage but no strategy. Shaburov became a hero who defeated the enemy, while Baberchenko made a needless sacrifice. Such practical experience and lessons in our army are even more numerous. From this, we should get a good lesson.

　　Leaders should set an example in learning theory. Deputy Commander Teng stipulated some theoretical books that cadres should study in his summary report. Be sure to study all the books that are stipulated to be studied. Cadres should read books and learn principles. Not only is it a matter of reading, but also to combine it with practice, learn and use consistently, and learn to apply. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu often taught us to study theory well, to be good at summarizing experience, to elevate experience to theory, and to enrich theory to guide practice. "Learn what you do, use what you learn." Learn and then use, use and then learn, use repeatedly, learn repeatedly, and improve step by step in continuous learning and use. If some cadres are unwilling to study theory, they should be enlightened to study and helped to study. If they do not voluntarily study, they should be forced to study and stipulated that they must read the books they are required to read. If worker-peasant cadres cannot read books themselves, intellectuals should read them to him and explain them to him. After reading and explaining them to him, ask him if he understands. This year, cadres will be inspected for their theoretical studies at a certain period. The large military region will be inspected, and each military region will also be inspected. But the main thing in learning theory is to rely on self-consciousness. If you are self-conscious, you will have time and you will be able to study. It is necessary to create a style of learning. Whoever does not learn will not progress, will lag behind or be eliminated. Some cadres carry their burdens and refuse to let go, put on airs of being veterans, put on airs of being meritorious ministers, abandon themselves, and refuse to learn. The Party's cadre policy takes morality, talent, and seniority as the standards; seniority is placed in the third place. And this seniority does not simply refer to qualifications, but refers to reputation. Therefore, it is not enough to rely on an old qualification alone. The result of putting on airs of being a veteran is the result of Gorlov. It should be known that not learning is shameful, not learning will lag behind. Gorlov put on airs of being a veteran and did not learn, and was finally eliminated. We must oppose the Gorlov thought. Putting on airs of being a veteran and not learning is Gorlov. A large cadre putting on airs of being a veteran is a big Gorlov, and a small cadre putting on airs of being a veteran is a small Gorlov. Whoever does not want to be Gorlov should study hard.

　　Mass line issue: As far as the army is concerned, from the commander-in-chief to the squad leader, whether it is the headquarters, the political department, the logistics department, or any other organ, the most basic issue is the idea of serving the soldiers. The most basic and broadest masses in the troops are the soldiers. It is also the soldiers who directly fight the enemy in battle. Without the soldiers, nothing can be accomplished, and the army itself cannot exist. Therefore, the mass line in the army can be said to be the line of serving the soldiers, and serving the masses is serving the soldiers. But some cadres do not care about the soldiers, his eyes only look up and do not look down. He cannot make the troops unite into an iron fist. This is an extremely bad tendency. We must clearly establish the idea of serving the soldiers, constantly care about their lives, care about their education and training, care about solving their difficult problems, and cherish their lives as much as we cherish our own lives.

　　The political education of the troops is basically spiritual education. The main thing is to improve the fighting spirit, to cultivate a tenacious fighting style, to develop a style of hating the enemy and being harmonious with ourselves, and to have the heroic spirit of "not being afraid of you" no matter what enemy is faced, and to have supreme courage. Refraining from arrogance is for the commanders. The French Napoleon has a famous saying: "The last five minutes." We must keep this in mind. The last five minutes are the key to determining victory or defeat. Many commanders are most prone to wavering in their determination at the most difficult and serious times, such as when casualties are high, repeatedly attacking and retreating, and the troops are prone to fatigue from continuous operations and continuous marching. It is easiest to let go of the final decisive moment. Therefore, it is necessary to keep in mind one thing: When you are at your most serious and most difficult, it is also the enemy's most serious and most difficult time. Often when your determination wavers due to difficulties, it is precisely when the enemy has felt despair about victory. This opportunity is the most important moment. This opportunity depends on which side can persevere, which side can survive the last five minutes, and which side can achieve victory. Therefore, we must insist on the last five minutes. The battles of Dayang Lake and Yangshanji were both battles in which leaders Liu and Deng were able to persevere for the last five minutes and achieve the final victory of annihilating the enemy. To cultivate oneself into a good commander, one must pay attention to: First, be brave and decisive, but not be impatient and rude. Bravery and decisiveness include wisdom. Second, be cautious and meticulous, but not be hesitant and indecisive, that is, as instructed by the central government, fight battles with planning, preparation, and certainty of victory. We must all pay more attention to these areas.

　　New recruit education is also very important. A commander must understand that people are the most precious. It is not easy for a child to grow into an adult. It takes eighteen to twenty years to grow into a person and reach the age of serving in the army. People cannot be resurrected after death. Therefore, we must cherish soldiers and cherish soldiers. It is a death-seeking tactic to pull a new recruit to the front line without training. It is also a death-seeking tactic to let soldiers rush around without talking about tactics. It is a crime for a commander to casually ask subordinates and soldiers to die. It is necessary to sacrifice people in battles, but there cannot be unnecessary sacrifices. If you understand this, you will naturally strengthen the training and education of the troops.

　　Finally, let's talk about the system issue: It is good and necessary to establish various systems in the troops. Without a certain system, it cannot be called an army. After the system is established, the main thing is to consolidate the system. It is wrong to forget it after the meeting. After the system is announced, everyone must abide by it and resolutely implement it. If you find a place that needs to be revised, you can propose a revision. But before it is revised, you cannot refuse to implement it on the pretext. In addition, for education and training, combat command, and administrative management, no matter who or which organ treats anyone or any organ, opinions can be raised. For example, systems such as assessing casualties and reviewing combat experience should promote democracy and promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. When soldiers make suggestions to cadres and subordinates make suggestions to superiors, such as criticizing cadres and superiors for improper command, increasing casualties, and other shortcomings and errors in command, tactics, and technology, they should humbly adopt and correct the shortcomings and errors, as well as other criticisms and self-criticisms of all work. This is a high degree of democracy in the army. But there is also the highest concentration. Subordinates must resolutely obey the orders and instructions of superiors. If you have opinions on orders and instructions, you can also raise them; but when the superior has not revised the order, you must still resolutely implement it. Destroying the system and disobeying orders is destroying discipline. Destroying discipline will be punished by discipline. We must strengthen the discipline of the army and cultivate a style of consciously abiding by discipline. Only when a high degree of democracy and a high degree of concentration are embodied can our army be an iron army, can it be united, can it overcome the enemy and win, can it defeat the U.S. and Chiang, achieve final victory, and be worthy of being an army led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

　　军区训练教育会议上
  　徐向前副司令员讲话
    一九四七年十二月二十六日同志们：
    象这样大的全区的部队训练教育会议，召集起来很不容易。在这次会议上，各军区各纵队进行了汇报和检讨，并交换了过去的经验，提供了以后工作上的意见，最后滕副司令员又作了总结报告，需要解决的问题都解决了。我简单地提出几点意见，供同志们参考。
    这次会议的精神，是检查去年十二月二十四日军委关于练兵及训练干部的指示的执行情形。检查的结果，有的没有传达，有的没有研究，有的同志还根本没有看到。这证明有些同志对军委指示的研究和执行是非常不够的。这固然有些客观原因，不能完全怪同志们，但有些责任是应该同志们负的，你们应严格的检讨一番，为什么军委的指示我们没有很好的执行？检讨过去，主要的为了将来。大家参加了这次会议，参加了检讨，又听取了滕副司令员关于部队训练教育的详细总结报告，回去以后，应好好传达和号召部队细致的研究和切实的执行。要切实的把这一责任负担起来。为什么呢？因为部队的训练教育，是十分严重的问题，是急迫需要改进的问题。部队的士兵和干部训练好了，仗就可以打好，可以减少伤亡，就可以取得胜利。部队训练不好，仗就打不好，就会增加部队的伤亡，战争就会失败。现在我们晋冀鲁豫军区的部队，更需加紧训练。我们对大规模的运动战和攻击敌人坚固据点的经验还不很丰富；可是我们的任务，是要肃清我区敌人残留的孤立据点和周围的残余敌人。这个任务是伟大的，也是艰巨的。要完成这伟大而又艰巨的任务，需要我们部队的战斗力大大提高一步，首先是提高攻坚和连续作战的能力。如果部队训练不好，战斗力就不会提高；相反的会遭到好多无谓的牺牲。因此我们对部队的训练教育，要采取对人民、对革命、对党、对战士和干部以极其负责的态度，要严肃的对待这一问题。根据这次大会的精神，检查我们的部队，存在着两种不同的作风：一种是对战争对战士对干部负责的态度，他关心战争，关心部队训练，关心士兵，爱护士兵，这是正确的态度正确的作风；另一种是对战争对士兵不负责的态度，他不关心战争，不关心部队的训练，不关心干部，不关心士兵，只是盲目的希望和要求打胜仗。可是如何才能打胜仗呢？他却不去好好研究了。后面这种作风是非常坏的，定要把它克服掉。前面那种关心战争，关心训练，关心士兵的正确作风，我们要好好发扬起来。因此，我们必须遵照毛主席的指示，要首长负责，亲自动手。过去各级首长对部队训练教育问题的思想有些干部还没有搞通，没有负起责来，那是不对的。今天把问题搞清楚了，各级首长就要亲自负起责来，不要不负责不动手，或者假负责假动手。首先我们要反对首长不负责或假负责的坏作风。每个干部要想成为一个智勇双全的指挥员，只管打仗不管训练教育是不行的。只管打仗，就打得好也只是尽了你的职责的一部分；而且，只管打仗不管训练的指挥员是往往打不好仗的。须知打好仗是建筑在练好兵的基础之上的。作一个首长，必须会打仗又会练兵。否则就不是好的指挥员。
    我们有许多干部，以为部队的训练教育是临时任务。开罢会，或者在大练兵运动中，开始轰轰烈烈的做一下，以后就慢慢松了气了。部队的训练教育是经常的、长期的。阶级存在一天，战争存在一天，军队就必须存在。军队要打胜仗，要想使革命战争取得胜利，把敌人消灭掉，军队的教育训练是一时一刻也不能放松的。稍放松一点，对部队对革命是无好处的。何况我们正处在为打倒美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石的残酷战争中，更不能对部队训练教育稍微放松一点。
    我们要反对干部不愿作训练工作参谋工作的观点。有好多干部不愿作教育工作和参谋工作，这是我们部队中最不好的一种传统。他们以为做了训练教育工作，就当不了首长。他们以为当教员当参谋没有地位，是组织上对自己的轻视或处罚。这是非常坏的思想，直到今天还在部队中存在着。其实当教员当参谋是很不容易的。苏联红军的朱可夫元帅，在苏德战争中是战功最著的，他过去也在红大当过教员。苏联红军的司令员和参谋长，就没有什么多大界限。今天当司令员到明天也会去当参谋长；当参谋长也可能调换去当司令员。过去我们对于参谋教员，强调文化水平，这固然有其原因，但也发生了偏向，当工农干部的文化水准尚未提高起来，这个问题怎样解决呢？我想应该工农干部和知识分子干部结合起来办学校和作司令部工作。工农干部只要有丰富的实际经验，能说能教，就可以去当教员。工农干部和知识分子干部结合起来工作，一面工农干部可以提高文化水平，一面知识分子也可结合了实际。这样可以互助互学互教，双方都可得益。
    另外我们要反对把军事工作和政治工作对立起来的倾向。有些军事干部以为军事工作是我的工作，政治工作不是我的工作。有些政治干部却以为政治工作是我的工作，军事工作不是我的工作。他们把军事工作和政治工作的统一性忘掉了，只强调其中的一个方面。实际上军事工作和政治工作是一个工作，二者的目的是一致的，都是为了打胜仗。军事工作指挥战斗，这是显而易见的在于打倒敌人。为了提高部队的战斗力及阶级觉悟，瓦解敌人，团结内部，就必须进行政治工作，目的仍然是为的打倒敌人。只看到军事工作而看不到政治工作，是单纯军事工作观点；只看到政治工作而看不到军事工作，是单纯政治工作观点。这样不能提高部队的战斗力，相反的会削弱部队的战斗力。一般的说，军事服从政治。但在军队里，政治工作是服务于军队的，要用政治工作保障军事的胜利，而军事工作与政治工作仍然是一个工作的两面。如果争执军事为主，还是政治为主；或者学校里争执军事时间要多，还是政治时间要多，这都是不对的。单纯的军事工作观点和单纯的政治工作观点，我们都要反对掉。而政治工作也不是专门政治干部的事，军事干部也必须作政治工作；军事工作也并不是专门军事干部的事，而政治干部也必须作军事工作。不论是军事工作干部，不论是政治工作干部，对军事工作和政治工作两者间相互关联，只有主要与次要之分，而无绝对对立的界限。
    反对空喊：首长和领导机关的责任，不只是发指示和提号召，而是要实际的去领导、组织和帮助部队和学校的教育与训练，把教育和训练计划规定和发下去以后，就必须经常督促和检查执行的情形如何，没有督促和检查，一切计划必然形成自流的现象，往往使原来的计划不能完满实现或者简直落了空。在检查中必须注意，那些计划是否妥善，是否须要修改，并适时发出补充的指示，交换各部队间实际经验，解决发生的一切困难问题，发扬优点纠正缺点，使教育训练的计划能如期的完满实现。要反对只空喊不实际干的官僚主义，要反对把教育和训练工作当作只是办学校的和训练部门同志们的事，自己是可以不管的。各级首长必须确确实实地把教育和训练的工作负担起来，不只要号召而且要（⑴⑵）实际参加去作和指导，不只要规定计划而且要组织经常的检查等等，只有这样才能把教育和训练工作办好。在部队和学校的教育中，我们都要反对教条主义和经验主义。教条主义和经验主义都会使理论和实际脱节。但是不能因反教条而把理论也反对掉。正确的理论是实际经验的结晶与指示实际行动的南针。列宁说：“没有革命的理论，就没有革命的行动。”也可以说，没有革命的军事理论，就没有革命战争的胜利。因此学习理论是非常重要的问题。毛主席教导我们学理论是有关革命成败的问题。今天我们部队军事干部，尤其是中、上级干部，要用最大的努力学习理论。有些干部忽视理论的学习，认为只要能打仗就行了，不必学习理论，这种倾向是非常错误的。学习与领会毛主席的革命的理论（革命的军事理论也在内），好比我们指挥作战时用望远镜观察敌战情一样，没有望远镜的帮助，远处的情况你就看不到，成了瞎子一样。好比如在化验室内用显微镜分析眼看不见的东西一样，没有显微镜的帮助，就不能获得眼看不到的东西的知识。所以革命的理论，就是我们作事的望远镜和显微镜，也就是我们作工作的科学方法。实际经验是很宝贵的，但当它不能上升成为理论时，经验有时就会害大事，只凭勇敢去打仗，不学习理论，会变成狭隘的军事经验论。教条主义把理论和实际脱节了，经验主义把理论忽视了，都是不对的。我们要很好的学习毛主席的思想方法，学习毛主席的军事理论。大家可以好好看看“日日夜夜”这本书。“日日夜夜”上，有苏联红军两个典型军事干部：一个是营长沙布洛夫，那是智勇双全的典型军人。一个是团长巴柏琴科，那是狭隘经验论者有勇无谋的典型。沙布洛夫成了战胜敌人的英雄，而巴柏琴科却作了无谓的牺牲者。我军这种实际经验教训，更是举不胜举，从这中间我们应得到很好的教训。
    学理论首长要以身作则。滕副司令员在总结报告中，规定了一些干部应学习的理论书籍。凡规定要学习的书，一定要去学习。干部要看书，学原则。不仅是看的问题，而且要结合在实际中去运用它，学用一致，学以致用。毛主席朱总司令经常教导我们好好学习理论，要善于总结经验，要把经验上升为理论，要把理论丰富起来再去指导实践。“做什么学什么，用什么学什么。”学了再用，用了再学，反复的用，反复的学，在不断的学和用中，就能一步步提高。如果有些干部不愿学习理论的，就要启发他学习，帮助他学习。如果不自愿的去学习，就实行强迫的学，规定要看的书非看不行。工农干部不能自己看书的，知识分子要念给他听，并给他讲解，给他念了讲了，再问他懂不懂。今年干部学习理论，到一定时期要进行检查，大军区要检查，各个军区也要检查。但是学理论，主要的还是要靠自觉性。一有自觉性就会有时间、就会学得进去的。要造成学习的风尚。谁不学习，谁就不能进步，就要落伍或被淘汰。有的干部背了包袱不放，摆老资格，摆功臣，自暴自弃，不肯学习。党的干部政策以德、才、资三者作标准的；资是摆在第三位。而且这个资，不是简单的指资格，是指的资望。因此只靠一个老资格是不行的。摆老资格的结果，就是戈尔洛夫的结果。须知不学习是可耻的，不学习就要落后，戈尔洛夫摆老资格不学习，最后是被淘汰下去了。我们要反对戈尔洛夫思想，摆老资格不学习就是戈尔洛夫，大干部摆老资格是大戈尔洛夫，小干部摆老资格是小戈尔洛夫。谁不愿当戈尔洛夫，谁就应该好好学习。
    群众路线问题：按军队来说，上自统帅，下至班排长，不管是司令部政治部和后勤部及其他一切机关，最基本的问题就是为兵服务的思想。部队中最基本最广大的群众就是士兵，在战斗中直接去打敌人的，也是士兵。离开了士兵，什么事也干不成，而且军队本身也就不能存在了。因此在军队中的群众路线，可以说就是为兵服务的路线，为群众服务就是为兵服务。可是有些干部不关心士兵，他的眼睛只向上看，不往下看，他就不能使部队团结成为一个铁的拳头，这是极坏的倾向。我们要明确树立为兵服务的思想，要经常关心他们的生活，关心对他们的教育和训练，要关心解决他们的困难问题，要爱护他们的生命如同爱护自己的生命一样。
    部队政治教育，基本上是精神教育，主要的是提高战斗精神，要培养成顽强的战斗作风，要养成对敌恨对己和的作风，不论是面向着任何敌人，都有“不怕你”的英雄气概，要有无上的勇气。戒骄是对指挥员说的。法国拿破仑有句名言：“最后的五分钟”，我们要牢记在心。最后五分钟，是决定胜负的关头。好多指挥员在最艰苦最严重的时候，譬如说伤亡很大，反复的打上去又退下来，部队的连续作战与连续行军很易感觉疲劳等，这种时机最易动摇决心，最易把最后决胜的时机放过去，因此须牢记一条：当你是最严重最困难的时候，也是敌人最严重最困难的时候，常常是当你因困难在决心发生动摇的时候，而恰恰正是敌人对胜利已感到绝望的时候，这种时机是最紧要的关头，这种时机决定于何方能坚持，何方能熬过这最后的五分钟，何方就能取得胜利，因此我们要坚持最后五分钟。选择指挥员，最好的是能顽强不屈，坚持最后五分钟。大杨湖战斗和羊山集战斗，都是刘邓首长能坚持最后五分钟，取得了最后歼灭敌人的胜利。要修养成为一个好指挥员须注意：一是勇猛果敢，但不要急燥粗暴，勇猛果敢是包括智慧的。二是谨慎细致，但不要犹豫不决，即如中央所指示的要打有计划的有准备的有胜利把握的仗。我们大家须要在这些地方多加注意。
    新兵教育也是十分重要的。一个指挥员必须懂得，人是最宝贵的。从一个小孩子长大成人，是很不容易的。长成一个人长成到当兵的年龄，需要十八到二十年，人死去是不能复活的。因此我们要爱护士兵，爱惜士兵。一个新兵如果不加训练就拉上火线，那是送死战术。不讲战术叫士兵去乱冲，也是送死战术。一个指挥员随便叫下级和士兵去送死，那是罪恶。打仗是必须牺牲人的，但不能作无谓牺牲。懂得了这一条，自然就要加强对部队的训练和教育了。
    最后谈一谈制度问题：部队中建立了各种制度是好的，必需的。没有一定的制度，就不成其为军队。制度定了以后，主要的是巩固制度。如果开过会后就忘掉了是不对的。制度公布以后，必须大家遵守，坚决实现。如果发现需要修改的地方，可提议修改。但在未修改以前，不能借故不执行。此外对于教育训练、作战指挥、行政管理，不管任何人和机关对待任何人和任何机关，有意见都可提出。譬如评定伤亡检讨作战经验等制度，应提倡民主，发扬批评与自我批评的精神。战士对干部，下级对上级提的意见如批评干部和上级指挥不当、增多伤亡及其他指挥上和战术上技术上各种缺点和错误的意见时，应虚心采纳改正缺点和错误，以及其他一切工作的批评和自我批评等，这是军队中高度的民主。但是还有一个最高的集中。上级的命令和指示，下级必须坚决服从。对命令和指示有意见，也可以提出；但当上级未修改命令时，仍须坚决执行。破坏制度、违抗命令，就是破坏纪律，破坏纪律要纪律制裁。我们要把军队的纪律严肃起来，要养成自觉遵守纪律的作风。只有这样体现了高度的民主与高度的集中时，我们的军队才是铁的军队，才能万众一心，才能克敌致胜，才能打垮美蒋，取得最后的胜利，才不愧为共产党毛主席所领导的一支军队。
