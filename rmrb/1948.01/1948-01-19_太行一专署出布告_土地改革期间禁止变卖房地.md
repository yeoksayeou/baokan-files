　　Taihang First Special District Administrative Office Issues Proclamation
  　Sale of Real Estate Prohibited During Land Reform
    [Our Dispatch] The Taihang First Special District Administrative Office issued a proclamation on January 10th, stating that landlords and rich peasants who take advantage of loopholes before the thorough and equal distribution is implemented to sell land and houses, eat and drink extravagantly, waste property, transfer or destroy property will be punished. The proclamation specifically stated that such transactions, if discovered, will be declared invalid. The proclamation also stated that because workers, poor peasants, and the impoverished have not completely turned their lives around and face many difficulties, those without housing should be given priority in local redistribution (ownership temporarily undetermined); those lacking capital and tools should be fully assisted by various economic departments to solve specific difficulties in production and organized to produce.

　　太行一专署出布告
  　土地改革期间禁止变卖房地
    【本报消息】太行一专署于一月十日发了布告，要惩办那些在未实行彻底平分前，乘机钻空子，变卖土地房屋，大吃大喝，浪费财产，转移或破坏财产的地主富农。布告并特别提出：这种买卖关系如被查出宣布无效。布告中同时还提出：因为工人、雇贫农和贫民没有翻透身，困难很多，没有房子住的，应在本地先行调剂（所有权暂不确定）；没有资本和工具的，各经济部门应全力帮助他们解决生产中的具体困难，组织他们生产。（建华、王毅）
