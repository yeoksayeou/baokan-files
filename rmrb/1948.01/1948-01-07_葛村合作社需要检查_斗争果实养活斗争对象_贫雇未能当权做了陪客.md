[Reported from Shahe by this newspaper] The Ge Village Cooperative in the Sixth District has been established for almost two years without ever providing an accounting to the masses. At that time, it was all set up using the fruits of the peasant association's struggles. The masses did not receive any of the fruits, and have not benefited from the cooperative to this day. Recent inspections revealed that the cooperative was controlled by a group of struggle targets. Although the cooperative chairman is a poor peasant, he is too honest and cautious, and only afraid of losing money, so he dares not act. (Is it really that the poor peasant chairman is incompetent? Or is it that the leadership didn't let go to the poor and hired peasants, and didn't give them a correct direction? Hoping for inspection – Editor). The accountant is a managing landlord. Of the three people in the oil mill, two are managing landlords who haven't been struggled against, and one is a landlord. This group of people eats their fill inside. Whether they claim a loss or a profit, it's whatever they say. In the oil mill, they eat well every night, and you can smell the aroma from far away. The poor and hired peasants in the village often reflect, saying: "So many fruits of struggle are nourishing a group of struggle targets. Is this benefiting the masses?" Cadres take money from the cooperative for personal use at will. In the summer, because of continuous rain, the masses didn't have grass to feed their livestock, so they went to the cooperative to buy sesame cakes (for livestock feed). The cooperative said: The cadres have bought all the sesame cakes and won't sell them to you. (In reality, the cadres didn't buy them). After the autumn harvest, when launching winter production, they emphasized taking care of the poor and hired peasants and solving their difficulties. The masses' dissatisfaction with the cooperative became even more apparent. When they bought oil from the cooperative, they wouldn't pay for it. As soon as they were asked for money, the masses would say: "I didn't get any of the fruits in the past. Now, not paying for this little bit of oil isn't even enough to compensate for my fruits!" In less than two months, more than 400,000 yuan was owed on credit. Because of the influence of the large cooperative, there were also difficulties in setting up small cooperatives in each group. For example, the first, second, and sixth groups all wanted to set up flower mills and oil mills, but the masses wouldn't invest. Zhang Shuangxi said: "The large cooperative has been running for two years, and who has benefited from it? No matter how you do it, I definitely won't invest." Shen Mang said: "We're setting up a flower mill again? The large cooperative's flower mill has been running for two years, and so far, let alone how much money it has made, it hasn't even given an accounting. I won't invest." At this time, the leadership mobilized and explained, emphasizing that in the future, the poor and hired peasants would be in power, and elect the poor and hired peasants to run it themselves. Shuangxi said: "If we run it ourselves, then that's okay?" Everyone started investing. Mang invested 2,000 yuan first. Later, Zhang Aixi (a poor peasant) was elected as a cadre, and Mang invested another 8,000 yuan. However, the real power of the small cooperative in the first and second groups was in the hands of the village chief (the village chief is a landlord who has not been struggled against). He also selected two middle peasant cadres. After raising capital, they first went to buy a cotton gin, but after buying it back, it sat idle for a month. Zhang Aixi was only in charge of keeping the money. The accountant sealed up the money collected every day in a cabinet and gave it to Shuangxi. Whenever he needed to spend money, he would go to Shuangxi's house to get it. Not only did the cotton gin not move, but the village chief took 30,000 yuan from it and went to Yongnian to buy back 3,000 jin of sesame cakes, earning 36,000 yuan, which all became his own. The masses reflected, saying: "Our flower mill bought back the gin a month ago and it hasn't moved, but someone took the money and went to do his own business." The oil mill in the seventh group was the same. On the surface, it also said that the poor and hired peasants were in power, and the militia instructor (a poor peasant) was made a nominal chairman, and the peasant association director (a poor peasant) managed the money (also like Zhang Aixi). In reality, three rich peasants were in control. After discovering these problems, in addition to immediately resolving them, a full village inspection is underway to see if other small cooperatives also have this problem. It is currently being resolved and inspected.
                                                                                                (Hu Xianxiao, Kui Lin)
The large cooperative is controlled by landlords and rich peasants, and the leadership is bureaucratic, not solving the problems, but only talking about letting the poor and hired peasants be in power, developing small cooperatives. As a result, the small cooperatives are also controlled by landlords and rich peasants. It is said that the poor and hired peasants are in power, but the result is that the hired and poor become "sidekicks." Is this caused by the leadership's opportunistic thinking and bureaucracy? The comrades leading the work in this village should conduct self-reflection and inspection, and publicly respond in the newspaper.
                                                                                                ——Editor

　　葛村合作社需要检查
    斗争果实养活斗争对象
  　贫雇未能当权做了陪客
    【本报沙河讯】六区葛村合作社自成立起来快两年了，没有给群众算过帐。那时都是用农会的斗争果实搞起来的，群众没有分到果实，至今也没有得过合作社的利益，经最近检查结果，原来是合作社被一伙斗争对象给掌握起来，社长虽然是个贫农，但因太老实、小心、光怕赔了钱不敢干。（究竟是贫农社长无能呢？还是领导上没放手给贫雇，没给贫雇一个正确方针呢？望检查——编者）会计是个经营地主，油坊三个人，两个是没有斗过的经营地主，一个是地主。他们这一伙人吃到里边，说赔算赔，说赚算赚，油坊里每天夜里吃好饭，远远就闻见香味了。村里贫雇经常反映说：“这么些斗争果实，养活着一群斗争对象，这是不是给群众谋利呢？”干部们随便从社里拿钱去用，群众夏天因连阴，没草喂牲口，到社里去买麻饼（喂牲口）。社里说：麻饼干部都买下了，不卖给。（实际上干部没有买）秋收以后，发动冬季生产时，强调提出照顾贫雇，解决困难，群众对合作社的不满更加表面化了，他们在合作社买了油也就不给钱了，一要钱群众就说：“过去我没分了果实现在赊这点帐还不够我的果实哩！”不到两个月就赊出了四十多万元。因为大合作社的影响，各组搞小型社时也受了困难。如一、二组、六组都想搞花坊油坊，但是群众都不集股，张双喜说：“大合作社搞了两年，谁得过一点利来？不管怎样搞，我反正是不入股”。申忙的说：“咱又搞花坊哩，大合作社的花坊两年了，至今别说赚钱多少，就是连帐也没给算过，我可不入股。”这时领导上就动员解释，强调说明以后要让贫雇掌权，选举贫雇自己干。双喜说：“要是咱自己干那还不行？”大家就入起股来，忙的先入了两千元，后来就选了张艾喜（贫农）当干部，忙的就又入了八千元，但是一、二组小型社的实权是掌握在村长手里（村长是个没有被斗的地主），他又选出了两个中农干部，集起股后就先去买了个弹花车子，但买回来放了一个月没有动弹，张艾喜只管放钱，会计把每天收起的钱封住一柜交给双喜，啥时花啥时到双喜家去拿，弹花弓没有动还不算，村长从里边拿了三万元到永年去买回来三千斤麻饼，赚了三万六千元，都成了他自己的。群众反映说：“咱这花坊买回弓来一个月不动，人家拿上钱去干自己的买卖了。”第七组的油坊也是一样，表面上也是说贫雇掌权，让民兵指导员（贫农）当了个名义社长，农会主任（贫农）管钱（也和张艾喜一样），实际上是三个富农在里边掌握实权。发现以上这些问题后，除马上解决处理外，并正在全村展开检查，看其他小型社中是否也有这种问题，现正解决和检查中。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（胡先孝、奎林）    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    大合作社被地主富农掌握，领导上官僚主义，不解决问题，却又空谈让贫雇掌权，发展小型社，结果小型社又被地主富农掌握。说的是贫雇当权，但结果雇贫变成“陪客”，这是不是领导上的投机思想官僚主义造成的？领导该村工作的同志应作反省检查，并在报上公开答复。
