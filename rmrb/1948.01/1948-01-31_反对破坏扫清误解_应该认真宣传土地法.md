[This dispatch] Opposing sabotage and sweeping away misunderstandings: The Land Law should be conscientiously publicized.

[This newspaper reports] The Land Law Outline aims to eliminate the feudal class and thoroughly redistribute land. In many places in Taihang, landlords have already been discovered plotting resistance; bad village cadres who have gained too much are secretly sabotaging; and some middle peasants and newly turned peasants temporarily believe landlord rumors, showing suspicion and panic. These sabotage activities of landlords and bad cadres should be stopped immediately, and the suspicions of middle peasants and turned peasants should be well explained and dispelled.

Du Xiyang, a landlord in Lijia’nao, Zuoquan, was previously said to be an "enlightened landlord." When he heard the Land Law Outline, his true colors were immediately revealed. At night, he said to his son, Du Erhai: "Sell the donkey, you son of a bitch, sell it for money, hold it in your hand, so they, the sons of bitches, can't divide it." Hao Jinyang, a rich peasant in Qiaogou, eats thin porridge on the street during the day, and steamed buns and oily cakes at home at night. Wei Xihe, a landlord in Nangou, eats sesame candy with his whole family at night. When eating, they close the door and tell their son to stand guard on the roof. Yang Xiaowu and Gao Yujin, landlords in Jiuyao, immediately spread rumors to middle peasants after hearing the Land Law Outline, saying: "This time it's your middle peasants' turn!"

The village chief of Shiyujun, Zuoquan, returned from a "Land Redistribution Conference" in the district on the 20th. He didn't publicize anything to the masses, but secretly sold five dan of grain himself. The masses are all quietly saying: "He came back without saying a word and sold grain. What's going on!" Not only did he sell it himself, but he also persuaded those who were against him to sell twenty dan. The village chief of Houyujiao didn't publicize the Land Law to the masses, but secretly sold three dan of corn. The village chief of Banshang secretly sold a donkey. The chairman of the Hanwang Farmers' Association immediately slaughtered six pigs from the vermicelli mill. After hearing about the Land Law, the chairman of the Shijie Village Farmers' Association in Linxian, who had gained too many fruits, privately sold a cow and a set of timber. The public security officer of Dongzhuang, Xiyang, quickly confiscated the property of two landlord households and one middle peasant household after seeing the Land Law. His reason was that the landlords were wasteful and the middle peasants had political problems. In fact, this middle peasant was his brother, and they had some grudges when they divided the family property, so he was taking the opportunity to retaliate. In addition, quite a few village cadres and a few district cadres do not read the Land Law Outline to the masses, saying that they are "afraid of affecting the production enthusiasm of the masses." There is also a more serious phenomenon, which is estimated to be an attempt by some people to provoke clan struggles between villages and split the unity of the peasants. Hongni and Tiihou villages in the sixth district of Pingshun are competing for a hillside, which is about two hundred mu in size, and is covered with small cypress trees, estimated to have a total of more than six thousand nine hundred trees. The largest of them is two chi in diameter. The two villages had had several quarrels over this forest before, but to no avail. The cadres of Hongni Village saw that the Land Law Outline stipulated that mountain forests should also be divided, and were afraid that the cypress slope would be divided to Tiihou Village. So, taking advantage of the absence of district cadres in the village for a meeting, they "mobilized" the masses in the folk school, asking the masses to chop them down at a low price of four yuan per jin (the general price of firewood is still fifteen yuan). On the 11th, some people chopped down trees for a day and chopped back more than twenty trees, preparing to continue chopping them down the next day. It happened that Comrade Zhang Xiaoxian of the county federation passed by and stopped it after asking. But the village cadres were still justified in saying, "This was agreed to by the masses."

Chen Bucai, a middle peasant in Rencun, Linxian, had already delivered manure to the field. When he heard about the equal distribution of land, he moved the manure to the edge of the field. He said, "If I am divided this half of the land, I will transport the manure to that half of the land. If I am divided that half, I will transport the manure to this side." Wang Fuyun, a turned peasant in Dongguan, Xiyang, said, "I agree with the equal distribution. But now I don't dare to deliver manure. I don't know which piece I can get!" Two middle peasant households in Beihengshan slaughtered two ewes after hearing about the equal distribution of land. Yang Wan-yi, a turned peasant, used to burn firewood, but now he burns open straw. After hearing about the Land Law, Li San, a turned peasant in Yangjiao, Zuoquan, said: "We only took it back from the landlords last year and planted it for only one year, and now we are giving it to the landlords again. I really can't figure it out."

### 反对破坏扫清误解　应该认真宣传土地法

　　反对破坏扫清误解
  　应该认真宣传土地法
    【本报消息】土地法大纲要消灭封建阶级，彻底平分土地。太行许多地方已发现地主阴谋反抗；多得果实的坏村干暗地破坏；有些中农和新翻身户一时听信地主谣言，表现怀疑、恐慌。对这些地主和坏干部的破坏活动应该立刻制止，对中农和翻身户的怀疑应该很好的说服解释。
    左权李家垴地主杜喜羊，过去有人说他是“开明地主”。他听到土地法大纲，真面目立时露出来了。夜里和他儿子杜二孩说：“把驴卖了狗日的，卖上钱，拿在手里，叫他们狗日的分不上。”荞沟富农郝今阳，白天到街上吃饭，端着稀饭，黑夜在家里吃蒸馍、油糕。南沟地主魏喜和，全家在黑夜吃麻糖。吃的时候关上大门，还叫儿子在房顶放上哨。九腰会地主杨小五、高玉金听了土地法大纲，立时向中农造谣说：“这回可该着你们中农啦！”
    左权石峪峻村长二十日到区上开“土地平分会”回来，没向群众宣传什么，自己先偷着卖了五石粮食。群众都悄悄的说：“回来不说二话，就卖粮食，这是怎么啦！”他不但自己卖了，还劝说和他对劲的人也卖了二十石。后玉茭村长不给群众宣传土地法，偷着卖了三石玉茭。阪上村长偷着卖了一个驴。寒王农会主席一下就杀了粉坊六口猪。林县石界村农会主席多得了果实，听到土地法后，私自卖了一头牛和一副木材。昔阳东庄公安员看到土地法，很快就没收了两户地主、一户中农的财产。他的理由是地主浪费，中农有政治问题。实际上这个中农和他是弟兄，在分家时结下了一些仇恨，他是借机会报复的。另外还有相当多的村干部和少数区干部，不给群众念土地法大纲，他们说是“怕影响了群众的生产情绪。”还有一种更严重的现象，估计可能是某些人企图挑动村与村的宗派斗争，分裂农民团结。平顺六区虹霓和梯后两村互争着一块山坡，这个坡约有二百多亩大，坡上长满小柏树，估计共有六千九百多棵。其中最大的直径有二尺。以前两村因这片山林闹过几回事，但没有结果。虹霓村干部看到土地法大纲上规定山林也要分，恐怕那个柏树坡分给梯后村。于是就乘区干部开会不在村的机会，在民校中“动员”群众，以每斤四元的低价叫群众随便去砍（一般柴价还得十五元）。十一日就有些人砍了一天，砍回二十多棵。准备第二天继续去砍。恰巧县联社张效先同志路过，问到了方才止住。但村干部还满有理由的说：“这是群众同意了的。”
    林县任村中农陈布才，已经把粪送到地里了，听说平分土地，又把粪移到地头上。他说：“分我这半块地，我就把粪运到那半块地里，分那半块，我就把粪运到这边。”昔阳东关王富云是个翻身户，他说：“我赞成平分。不过现在我不敢送粪，还不知我能分到哪一块呢！”北横山有两户中农听说平分土地，杀了两只母羊。杨万一是个翻身户，他先前打柴烧，这时却烧开谷草了。听了土地法以后，左权羊角翻身户李三的说：“咱去年才从地主手里拿回来，才种了一年，又给地主分，我实在想不通。”
