[Taihang News] When Heshun, Xiyang and Shexian and some other areas inspected the textile work, it was discovered that many poor women were still in a painful position of being discriminated against and oppressed in this regard. In Wen Yuan Village, Heshun Second District, the village head, political director, and other cadres verbally promoted the mobilization of poor tenant farmers in textile work. However, the actual inspection results revealed that among the 101 so-called poor tenant women textile workers, two were women from landlord and rich peasant families and 60 were women from middle-peasant families; among the eleven so-called poor tenant group leaders, one was a feudal woman and five were middle-peasant women. The real poor tenant women still couldn't rise up, their textile difficulties were not resolved, and they couldn't get on the machines to learn weaving. In Baichan Village, Shexian Seventh District, it was even discovered that district and village cadres forcibly organized poor women to join small textile factories. At meetings for poor women, they mobilized left and right, saying how good it was to establish small factories, but they didn't care about the difficulties faced by poor women at home due to their complex lives. As a result, although the small factories were set up to "look the part," the poor women were burdened by household chores, and their thinking was resistant. On December 25th last year, the Second District of Xiyang convened more than 140 poor women to review two months of textile work. They accused the fact that “feudal women lead textile work, and poor women suffer” with many painful stories. Zhao Xiyun, a poor woman from Tianchuan, who had begged for food for eight or nine years, said: "The female salvation secretary and deputy secretary in our village are all big landlords, and the deputy secretary, Shang Fenglan, specifically cultivates four feudal women to learn textile work. I also wanted to learn, but they pushed me out the door! Later, it was only because the village cadres insisted that they let me in, but they were still in charge, and I didn't know anything, and they didn't teach me anything. I didn't dare to say anything. They also scolded me, saying, "The new society has lifted you up. Learning textile work? Look at you, who just took off your beggar's shoes. Are you even a respectable person?” I was so scared that I shivered all over. Even so, the cadres never cared, and I have been tortured ever since!" Wang Bani from Huihuang Village said, "In our village, the feudal Wang Cunhua is the teacher, showing off her power in the machine room, always smoking cigarettes. Two poor women who are apprentices even have to serve her. Anyway, those feudal women dress well and are pretty, and everyone looks up to them. We dress badly and are ugly, and we are just learning textile work. Who looks up to us?" The above is the true voice of poor women!

　　地主富农把持纺织压迫欺侮贫雇妇女
  　和顺等地检查纺织工作
    【太行消息】和顺、昔阳及涉县某些地区检查纺织工作时，发现好多贫雇妇女在这方面还处于被歧视和受压迫的痛苦地位。和顺二区温源村长、政治主任等干部，口说发动雇贫纺织，实际检查结果，发现一百零一个所谓雇贫纺妇中、就有两个是地主富农妇女，六十个是中农妇女；十一个所谓雇贫组长中，就有一个是封建妇女，五个是中农妇女。真正的雇贫妇女还是起不来，纺织困难没解决，也不能上机学织布。涉县七区白芟村，更发现了区村干部硬组织雇贫妇女加入小型纺织工厂；他们在雇贫妇女会上，左动员右动员，说成立小型工厂如何好，对雇贫妇女在家中生活繁杂等困难却不管；结果小型工厂虽然搞的“象个样子”，可是雇贫妇女被家事累着，思想是抵抗的。去年十二月二十五号，昔阳二区召集了一百四十多个雇贫妇女，检查两个月来的纺织；她们控诉了“女封建领导纺织，雇贫妇女受熬煎”的好多痛苦。田川的雇贫妇女赵喜云，曾经要过八九年饭，她说：“俺村妇救正副秘书都是洪水的大地主，副秘书尚凤兰专门培养着四个封建妇女学纺织，咱也想去学，人家就把咱推出门啦！后来还是村干部硬说才让咱进去，可是还由人家当权，咱啥也不会，人家也不教给，咱吭也不敢吭。人家还骂俺说：“新社会高抬你啦，学纺织哩？不看你是个刚抽起讨饭鞋后跟的，还是个啥正经人？”吓的咱混身哆嗦，就这，干部也没管过，一直受伢熬煎！”回黄村的王巴尼说：“俺村是封建王存花当教师，在机房抖威风，嘴不离纸烟，有两个贫苦妇女当学徒，还得侍候人家。反正人家封建妇女穿的好，长的漂亮，都看起人家。咱穿的坏，又生的丑，刚学纺织，笨手笨脚，谁看起咱？”以上就是雇贫妇女真实的呼声！
