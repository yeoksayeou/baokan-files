　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: London - Over 60,000 people here held a grand meeting on the 5th to commemorate the 18th anniversary of the British Communist Party's "Daily Worker." Two days before the commemoration (3rd), British Prime Minister Attlee delivered an anti-Soviet and anti-communist speech representing American imperialism, which became the theme of criticism for several speakers at the Daily Worker's 18th anniversary celebration. Horner, General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, countered Attlee's claim: Talking about political freedom without an economic foundation is empty talk. There is only one way to raise the people's living standards, and that is through a socialist planned economy, not capitalist anarchy. Horner emphasized that the Daily Worker must oppose the reactionary attempt to divide the unity of British workers. Regarding Attlee's nonsense about the United States upholding individual freedom, Horner recalled what he had seen during his trip to the United States, where he witnessed thousands of people being deprived of their basic rights because they were black. Rust, the chief writer of the Daily Worker, said in his speech that one of the differences between the Communists and the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party is that we trust Britain, while they trust the US dollar.
　　
　　Gasan, representing the French Communist Party, paid tribute to the audience. He particularly emphasized that the task of communist newspapers is to faithfully report the facts, which is completely different from capitalist newspapers that distort the facts. Gasan mentioned the recent strikes in France, in which 3 million workers participated, while the international reactionary newspapers spread rumors, insisting that the strikes were organized by the Communist Party to create chaos. In reality, this is because French workers cannot endure their increasingly impoverished living conditions. Gasan stated that most French trade unions are still loyal to the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) and the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). Talking about the policies of US imperialism, Gasan said that the United States is attempting to forcibly exploit France and force Western countries to sever ties with the Soviet Union and the new democracies. The Communists reject this policy, and they resist the threat of war.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Comprehensive reports from various sources: The French working class continues to denounce the treacherous acts of the French Socialist Party's scabs in splitting the CGT. The executive committees of the trade union federations of Côtes-d'Armor in Brittany, Calvados in Normandy, Haute-Saône in eastern France, and Haute-Garonne in southern France, among others, reaffirmed their loyalty to the CGT at the beginning of the year and condemned the divisive activities of "Workers' Force." After the scabs such as Stone House split off, the central bureau of the CGT reported on the current situation in the trade unions affiliated with the CGT in various places and stated with satisfaction that the French CGT has achieved good results in the aspect of the unions whose unity have been attacked.
　　
　　The treacherous activities of the French Socialist Party have also been criticized by the Hungarian trade unions. The Hungarian Trade Union, which has 1.5 million members, sent a telegram to the French CGT at the beginning of the year, expressing its indignation at the activities of the splitters within the trade union, denouncing them as betraying the working class. The telegram stated: Our combat experience teaches us that the tighter the unity of the working class, the more consolidated our political rights will be, and the better we will be able to defend peace and oppose the imperialist warmongers. The Hungarian Executive Committee asks you to resolutely safeguard the unity of the working people.

　　伦敦六万多人开会
  　庆祝工人日报十八周年
    【新华社陕北九日电】伦敦讯：此间六万余人于五日举行盛大集会，纪念英共“工人日报”出版十八周年。纪念会前两天（三日），英国首相艾德礼向美国帝国主义作代表功的反苏反共演说，适成为工人日报十八周年纪念会上若干演说者的抨击主题。全国矿工联盟总书记霍尔纳反击艾氏称：谈政治自由而无经济自由作基础，便是空话。提高人民生活水平只有一个办法，即用社会主义的计划经济，而不是资本主义的无政府状态。霍尔纳强调称：工人日报必须反对反动派分裂英国工人团结的企图。谈及艾德礼的胡说：所谓美国维护个人自由等等时，霍氏追述他旅美所见，他曾看到成千的人民因为是黑种人，而被夺去了基本权利。工人日报主笔鲁斯特演说称：共产党人与工党右派领袖之间分歧点之一，便是我们信任英国，而他们信任美元。
    加善代表法共向听众致敬。他特别着重指出共产党报纸的任务，在于忠实报导事实，而与资本家歪曲事实的报纸全然不同。加善说到法国最近的罢工，曾有三百万工人参加，而国际反动报纸则造谣，硬说罢工是共产党组织来制造紊乱的。实际上这是因为法国工人不能忍受其日益贫困的生活条件。加善称：目前法国大多数工会仍忠实于总工会及世职。谈到美帝国主义的政策时，加善称：美国的企图是要强行剥削法国，并迫使西方各国对苏联及各新民主主义国家绝交，共产党人拒绝这种政策，他们抗拒着战争的威胁。
    【新华社陕北六日电】综合各方讯：法国工人阶级继续斥责法国社会党工贼对总工会的分裂罪行。布列塔尼半岛的都诺尔省，诺曼第半岛的卡尔瓦多省，东部的索恩豪特省和南部的加隆豪特省等工会联合会执委会，于年初重申忠于总工会，并斥责“工人力量”的分裂活动。总工会中央局在石屋等工贼分裂出去之后，曾在各地总工会所属工会中报告目前形势，并满意地申明，在团结被分裂者所攻击的各工会方面，法国总工会已获得了良好的结果。
    法国社会党的工贼活动，亦受到匈牙利工会的抨击。拥有会员一百五十万的匈工会，年初致电法国总工会，对工会内部分裂者的活动表示激愤，斥其为背叛工人阶级。电文称：我们的战斗经验教导我们：工人阶级团结的愈紧，我们的政治权利就愈巩固，我们就愈能更好地保卫和平，反对帝国主义战争贩子。匈牙利执委会要求你们坚决维护劳动人民的团结。
