　　Military Academy Taiwan Team Students Celebrate First Anniversary of New Life
    [Our Newspaper] The Military Academy Taiwan Team solemnly celebrated its first anniversary of new life on the 11th, holding a grand meeting at its station.
    As the meeting began, over a hundred Taiwanese soldiers sang the "Taiwan Youth Song," followed by an opening speech by Instructor Lin. He first explained that the Taiwan Team was formed on January 9th of last year, composed of 138 individuals from the 139th and 140th Brigades, among whom 101 had already fought in the People's Liberation Army. He then pointed out their three greatest advancements over the past year:
    1.  In the past, they were unclear about their own class, searching for a "motherland" everywhere, not knowing for whom they were working. Now, after studying the history of Sino-Japanese-Taiwanese relations, investigating class backgrounds, and engaging in land reform studies, especially after the speak bitterness meetings, they calculated the accounts of exploitation by imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek's comprador capitalists, and landlords, deeply recognizing themselves (component statistics: proletariat accounted for 57 percent, petty bourgeoisie 26 percent, those from worker-peasant backgrounds totaled 92 percent). They realized how severely they had been exploited and oppressed by landlords and imperialists. Among 118 individuals, 223 siblings had been forced into prostitution, and 115 parents and siblings had been starved to death in the hands of landlords and big capitalists. Now, they have clarified their direction, knowing that the Chinese Communist Party truly represents the interests of the Chinese people; they found their true motherland after arriving in the liberated areas and realized that they themselves are the masters of Taiwan.
    2.  Culturally, before coming to the school, 86 people could not write compositions, 34 were illiterate, and only 18 could write compositions. Now, 87 people can write compositions, and 42 can read and write. After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, most are able to copy it down.
    3.  After liberation, 18 people performed meritorious deeds at the front, one special-class combat hero, and five others were commended.
    Such great achievements were attained due to the increased class consciousness and the resolution of the unity problem between the Gaoshan ethnic group and the Han ethnicity (a portion of the students are from Taiwan's minority Gaoshan ethnic group).
    He also pointed out that they have rectified their ranks, united as one, and carried out the struggle against Lin and Li Agu, purging the internal bad elements; and they must continue to deeply resolve ideological problems.
    During the free speeches, many comrades eagerly spoke, recalling their past suffering of the past year and their progress, unanimously shouting, "We must bravely advance under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! Whoever oppressed us in the past, whoever deceived us, we will overthrow them!"
    Finally, Vice-Principal Zhou and Director Li instructed everyone: "You should further improve on the existing foundation, study revolutionary skills well, especially study the Outline Land Law, so that you can return early, mobilize the workers and peasants of Taiwan to unite all the people, and establish a new Taiwan." Before the adjournment, the Taiwan Team Workers and Peasants Committee representative also read out a telegram thanking Chairman Mao. In the evening, they performed two plays they had composed themselves using Taiwanese tunes, "Motherland Mao Zedong," and the Gaoshan ethnic group performed "One Year's Progress." (Lü Zhen)

　　军大台湾队学员庆祝新生一周年
    【本报讯】十一日，军大台湾队隆重庆祝新生一周年，在驻地开了一个大会。
    大会开始，一百多台湾战士高唱“台湾青年歌”，接着林指导员致开会词。他首先说明了台湾队是去年一月九日由一三九旅、一四○旅一百三十八人组成的，其中有一百零一人已参加人民解放军打过仗。然后指出一年来他们三点最大的进步：
    一、过去对自己的阶级弄不清楚，到处“找祖国”，不知道为谁来干。现在经过学习中、日、台关系史，查阶级、土改学习，特别是诉苦大会后，算过帝国主义、蒋介石买办资本家和地主的剥削帐，深刻认识了自己（成份统计：无产阶级占百分之五十七，小资产百分之二十六，出身工农的共百分之九十二），知道自己受地主、帝国主义的剥削压迫是怎样的厉害。在一百一十八个人中，就有二百二十三个兄弟姊妹被逼迫出卖，一百一十五个父母兄弟姊妹被逼饿死在地主、大资本家手里。现在认清了方向，知道中国共产党才是真正代表中国人民利益的；到解放区以后才找到了真正的祖国，也觉悟到了自己就是台湾的主人。
    二、文化上，未到校前有不会作文的八十六人，不认字的三十四人，会作文的只十八人。现在会作文的已经有了八十七人，会认会写的四十二人，土地法大纲颁布后，多数都能够抄下一份来。
    三、解放过来后，在前方立了功的有十八人，一个特等战斗英雄，记好的有五个人。
    由于提高了阶级觉悟，解决了高山民族与汉族的团结问题（有一部分同学是台湾少数民族高山民族人），才获得了这样大的成绩。
    并指出他们已经整顿了自己的队伍，团结一致，进行了反林和李阿古的斗争，清除了内部的坏蛋；并要继续深入的解决思想问题。
    自由讲话中，许多同志争前恐后发言，回忆自己一年来前的痛苦和一年的进步，同声欢呼：“要在共产党毛主席领导下勇敢前进！过去谁压迫了我们，谁欺骗了我们，我们就打倒谁！”
    最后周副校长、李主任指示大家：“应在现有基础上更加提高一步，好好学习革命本领，特别是研究好土地法大纲，以便早日打回去，发动台湾工农团结全体人民，建立新台湾。”在休会前，台湾队工农委员会代表并宣读感谢毛主席的电文。晚间演出了他们自己用台湾曲调编成的“祖国毛泽东”和高山族编演的“一年来的进步”两个剧。（吕真）
