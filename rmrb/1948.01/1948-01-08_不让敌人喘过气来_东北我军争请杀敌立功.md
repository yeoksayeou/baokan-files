Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd of the month: Due to the general increase in class consciousness and the gradual improvement of equipment, the morale of the Northeast People's Liberation Army's field corps is growing stronger with each battle. Although currently in a freezing climate of over thirty degrees below zero, the soldiers have unanimously proposed "not letting the enemy catch their breath" and have submitted letters or sent representatives to superiors requesting to kill the enemy and achieve merit. Everyone has formulated plans, made various guarantees to superiors for continuous operations, and made specific studies and preparations for the various difficulties that may be encountered in winter operations. Many letters of request begin with the following: "Our bayonets and hand grenades are ready, just waiting for orders from superiors." The battle report of a certain unit has published more than 500 requests for battle in recent days. In the rush to the command post to request battle, not only entire squads, platoons, companies, and battalions, but even a certain regimental commander, Cao Shaopi, personally led 20 representatives from the entire regiment to request battle. Heroes have taken the lead in expressing their determination to continuously achieve merit in continuous operations. The ninety-six heroes of the Jiabao battle have jointly submitted a letter requesting assignments. Amidst the competition among various units to request battle and kill the enemy, cadres are using their indomitable will to overcome all difficulties, carefully conduct operations, and strive for victory. They believe that this year the material conditions are better than last year, there is experience in preventing frostbite, and the morale of the troops is generally high. In the winter campaign, they will definitely be able to achieve greater war victories.

　　“不让敌人喘过气来”
  　东北我军争请杀敌立功
    【新华社东北二日电】由于阶级觉悟普遍提高，装备逐渐改善，东北人民解放军各野战兵团士气愈战愈旺。目前虽处零下三十余度的严寒气候中，战士们仍一致提出“不让敌人喘过气来”，纷纷上书或派代表到上级请求杀敌立功。每个人都订出计划，向上级提出连续作战的种种保证，对冬季作战可能遇到的种种困难亦作了具体的研究和准备。许多请战书的开头都这样写着：“我们的刺刀和手榴弹都准备好了，就是等上级的命令。”某部战斗报连日来发表的请战书已达五百余件。在赴指挥部请战中，不仅有全班、全排、全连、全营、甚至有某团长曹绍丕亦亲自率领全团二十位代表前往请战。功臣们都纷纷带头表示决心，要在连续作战中连续立功。季家堡战斗的九十六名功臣已共同上书，要求给予任务。各部在争相请战竞赛杀敌声中，干部均以艰苦卓绝的意志，去克服一切困难，细心作战，争取胜利。认为：今年物质条件比去年好，防冻也有了经验，部队士气亦普遍高涨，在冬季大作战中，一定能争取更大的战争胜利。
