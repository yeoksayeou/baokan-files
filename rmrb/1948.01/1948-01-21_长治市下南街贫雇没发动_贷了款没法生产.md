[News from this newspaper] Xia Nan Street in Changzhi City, in order to implement the policy of relying on poor and hired peasants, conducted another inspection after the winter loans were distributed. Because the winter loan methods were simplistic, causing dissatisfaction among some middle peasants, the purpose of this re-examination was mainly to discover and solve the difficulties of poor and hired peasants, and also to resolve the dissatisfaction of middle peasants, so as to achieve unity between poor and middle peasants to jointly get rich. The method was to hold small street forums for middle and poor peasants, mobilizing everyone to raise difficulties and say whatever they had to say. Cheng Yushan's wife, a hired peasant, said: "My family of six shares a tattered quilt. My husband is over sixty years old and works as a cook at the Fuxing Leather Factory, but he hasn't received any dividends for months. The corn isn't ripe yet, but we're already picking it in the fields to eat. Now I've been loaned 40,000 yuan, but I can't do anything else. I bought two sheep, planning to fatten them up and sell them to earn some money. I spin some wool every day, but with the old and the young, and the grain almost gone, I don't know what to do!" Cheng Fengming's mother said: "My family of ten harvested six shi of corn. My third son joined the army, and my eldest son has been sick at home for more than three months, not earning a penny, and still needing pocket money. I only have 30,000 yuan to invest, but I had to use it for medicine. This time I've been loaned 20,000 yuan, and I can only spin some wool. I'm really worried!" Yu Youwen said: "We, three men and six women (poor and hired peasants), were loaned a total of 160,000 yuan. We organized a new flour mill, and business is okay, but no one knows how to keep accounts, which is a worry." Guo Suoze's mother said: "We, eight households (hired and poor peasants), were loaned a total of 250,000 yuan. There is only one laborer over fifty years old, and he's also sick. The street cadres helped invest the 250,000 yuan in the Tongshun Flour Mill in this street. But we're afraid of losing money. We only dare to see profits, not losses, because if we lose, we'll be in trouble. Since borrowing the money, I can't even sleep." Shen Sanhai said: "I'm a new middle peasant, but Yu Genzhi (Director of Civil Affairs) made me a former middle peasant and wouldn't give me a loan. What's my class status anyway?" Shen Mami said: "It's not just that they didn't give me a loan, but why did they classify me, a hired peasant, as a former middle peasant?" Li Pihai, Liu Changfa, Cheng Zhi, Pei Fugui, and Shen Heqi are five households of hired peasants who all need loans but didn't get them. After the problems were discovered, the cadres and the Winter Loan Committee studied the matter and decided that eleven households of hired peasants, including Pei Fugui, needed 190,000 yuan in loans, which would be resolved by the street credit cooperative, with the same interest rate as the winter loans. Cheng Yushan (the most disadvantaged person in the entire street) was lent two shi of corn and a quilt from the poor people's association's grain reserves. Cheng Fengming (the second most disadvantaged hired peasant in the entire street) was lent one shi and five dou of corn. The street cadres also helped Yu Youwen's group hire the manager and accountant of the Tonghe Flour Mill to help with writing and calculating production accounts, investing loans for the widowed and orphaned in various production departments to ensure profits. The problems raised by the hired peasants have now been resolved separately. (Changzhi City Guide)

The survey on the situation after the loans to poor and hired peasants in Xia Nan Street, Changzhi City, is very good, but there are two points to consider regarding the solutions adopted after the survey: First, are the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants being solved by cadres and the Winter Loan Committee increasing loans, lending grain, and finding a literate person, or is it a top-down, paternalistic approach? The better approach should be to mobilize the poor and hired peasants themselves to solve the problems. If it's only handled by the higher-ups and village cadres, it will definitely be difficult. Second, why are the village cadres arbitrarily changing class status? The masses have raised this issue and it should be resolved.

　　长治市下南街贫雇没发动
  　贷了款没法生产
    【本报消息】长治市下南街为了贯彻雇贫路线，在冬贷发放后，又进行了一次检查。因冬贷方式上简单，曾引起了中农阶层一部分人的不满，所以这次再查目的，主要是发现与解决雇贫困难，同时也解决中农不满思想，达到贫中团结共同闹发家。在方法上：是分小街召开中贫座谈会，动员大家提困难，有啥说啥。雇贫程玉山妻说：我家六口人，伙盖一条破被子，男人六十多岁，在复兴皮革工厂做饭，几个月啦也分不上个红利，玉茭没黄熟，就在地里挑着吃，现在给我贷了四万元，别的不能干，我买了两只羊，喂胖卖了打算赚几个钱。我是每天纺些毛，老的老，小的小，粮食快完啦！怎样也没法。程凤鸣娘说：我家十口人，收六石玉茭，三儿子参军，大儿子在家病了三月多，一个钱赚不上，还要零花，只有三万块投资，因吃药也抽来花了，这次给我贷两万块钱，我只能纺些毛，真是发愁呀！于友文说：我们三个男人，六个妇女（贫雇），共贷十六万块钱，新组织一个面坊，买卖也还可以，就是没一人会写帐发愁的很。郭锁则娘说：我们八户（雇贫），共贷款二十五万，只有一个五十多岁劳力，还有病，街干部帮助把二十五万块钱投到本街同顺面坊。可不敢教赔了钱，只敢见红，不敢见黑，赔了可没法，自贷上款，我连觉也睡不着。沈三孩说：我是个新中农，俞根之（民政主任）把我弄成旧中农，不让我贷款，我到底是个啥成份。申马迷说：不贷给款不说，为啥把我雇贫划成旧中农？李皮孩、刘常法、程枝的、裴富桂、沈和气等五户都是雇贫，都需贷款，没贷上。问题发现后，经干部和冬贷委会研究，裴富桂等十一户雇贫，需要贷款十九万，由本街信用合作社负责解决，利息和冬贷一样。程玉山（全街最困难者）由贫民会存粮中借给玉茭两石，被子一条。程凤鸣（全街二等困难雇贫）借给玉茭一石五斗。街干部并帮助于友文组，聘请同和面坊经理、会计帮助写算生产帐目，孤寡贷款，投资各生产部，保证赚钱，雇贫提出的问题，现都分别解决了。（长市导报）
    长治市下南街对贫雇贷款后的情况作了调查很好，但调查后所采取的解决办法则有两点要考虑：第一、贫雇的困难是由干部和冬季贷委员会增发贷款、借给粮食、找个识字人等办法来解决，还是一种自上而下的包办办法，较好的办法应该是发动贫雇自己起来解决，单由上边办，村干部办，事情就一定难办好。第二、村干乱划成份，为什么？群众提出来了，应该解决才对。
