Resolutely suppress the resistance and sabotage of the landlord class, and do not stand idly by or adopt an irresponsible attitude.
    3. No illegal acts of shielding or protecting landlords and rich peasants and obstructing the mass struggle are allowed. Those whose families are landlords or rich peasants should stand firmly on the side of the poor and hired peasants and are not allowed to protect their families or come up with bad ideas.
    4. It is not allowed to encroach upon, buy cheaply, or steal the fruits of the peasants' struggle. Military personnel participating in the land reform work shall also not be allowed to share in the spoils or accept any gifts from the masses.

All our soldiers must respect the new democratic governments at all levels, as well as the poor peasant leagues, peasant associations, peasant representative conferences, and the policies, laws, resolutions, and regulations they have decided, and protect all democratic rights of the people, and must not have any acts of violation or sabotage.
    The above articles must be conscientiously observed and implemented by all combatants and commanders of all our military units.
