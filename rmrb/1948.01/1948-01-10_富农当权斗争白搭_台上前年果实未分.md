　　Rich Peasants in Power Render Struggle Useless
　　Fruits of Struggle From Two Years Ago Still Undistributed
    [Shahe News] In Taishang Village, Fourth District, it was discovered that the fruits of the land reform struggle from two years ago have not yet been distributed to the hired and poor masses. The village has thin soil and the people live a very hard life. The village has only forty households, and villagers make a living by farming and grinding flour. General cadres said: "The village is poor and there are no big landlords, so it is not easy to turn things around." They rarely went to work in this village. It wasn't until the district-wide conference of over five hundred hired and poor representatives and hired and poor rural cadres was held on December 24th to inspect winter production that it was discovered that the masses had not turned things around at all. Han Chunzhao, a hired peasant in the village, said: "Our village chief, Han Changnian, was a puppet Ba長 [head of a bao, a subdivision of a township during the Nationalist period] during the enemy-puppet era, and also a rich peasant who was struggled against. The secretary, Han Xiaotang, is a 'voluntary household' (a household that evaded struggle by voluntarily handing over grain and land). Twenty bags of grain, two hundred jin of cloth, and trees, etc., from the struggle have not been distributed. The village chief even sent a piglet to his sister's house to raise. This is what they call the hired and poor turning things around, turning around empty-handed." This gave the cadres from the county and district who attended the meeting a great education, and they examined and recognized their past mistakes and bureaucratic work style. After the meeting, Comrade Zhang Haiquan, the distribution secretary, went to the village to deal with these problems. From this, he discovered that six hired and poor households, with fourteen people, had no housing. The village chief used the ox obtained through struggle for his own transportation. Wang Bangren, a rich peasant who was struggled against, had three people and twenty-three rooms. Han Laobian had four people and twenty rooms. Other people like Han Xiaohe and Han Siwei also had many houses. Comrade Zhang immediately convened a meeting of hired and poor peasants to discuss the matter. He temporarily lent houses to six hired and poor households, including Yang Jiezizi, and removed the village chief. The embezzled ox was taken out and handed over to the hired and poor to use for transportation. (Dehua)
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    The masses of Taishang Village are still ruled by traitorous puppet Ba長 and feudal rich peasants, living a poor life. It is not enough for the leadership to simply be shocked and admit their own bureaucracy; further examination should be conducted. After the branch committee secretary discovered the problem, he immediately replaced the village chief and handed over the ox to the hired and poor. This handling is appropriate. But have the masses of this village consciously risen up to take charge? Has the land problem of the hired and poor been resolved? Further examination should be conducted to seek a fundamental solution.

　　富农当权斗争白搭
  　台上前年果实未分
    【沙河消息】四区台上村，发现前年土地改革斗争果实尚未分给雇贫群众，这村石厚土薄，老百姓生活很苦。全村只有四十户，村民除种地外兼打磨为生。一般干部说：“村穷无大户，不易来翻身。”他们很少到这村去工作。在去年十二月廿四日召开全区五百余人雇贫代表及雇贫农村干检查冬季生产，会议上才发现群众根本没翻身。该村雇贫韩纯朝说：“俺村村长韩长年是敌伪时代的伪保长，又是被斗的富农，书记韩小唐是自动户（逃避斗争，自动出粮出地的户）。斗争果实粮二十袋，布二百斤，还有树等都没有分。村长并把一口小猪送他姐家喂，这样雇贫翻身，翻了个空身”。这样给了县区到会干部很大的教育，并检查认识了他们过去的错误与官僚主义作风。会后，分书张海泉同志到村里处理这些问题，从中又发现有雇贫六户人十四口，无房住。村长将斗争来的牛自己搞运输。被斗富农王邦人三口，有房二十三间。韩老扁人四口，有房二十间。其他韩小和、韩四为等房子也不少。张同志当即召开雇贫会商讨，暂给杨杰子等六户雇贫借了房住，把村长撤换了，贪污的那头大牛牵出来交雇贫搞运输。（德华）
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    台上村群众仍被奸伪保长封建富农统治，过着穷困生活，这件事情，领导上只吃一惊说自己官僚主义是不够的，还应再作检查。分委书记发现问题后，立即撤换村长，把牛拿出来交给雇贫，这样处理是应当的。但这村群众是否自觉起来当家搬石头？雇贫的土地问题是否得到解决了？还应该再作检查，才能求得根本解决。
