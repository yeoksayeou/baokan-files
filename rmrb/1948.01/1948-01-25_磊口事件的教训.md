    Lessons from the Leikou Incident

    The Leikou Village branch in Anyang was infiltrated by landlords and rich peasants, undermining the peasant emancipation movement, forcing the village head, who was from a poor peasant background, to death, resulting in a heartbreaking loss. This incident also provides a profound understanding of how wise Chairman Mao's call to reorganize the Party ranks and the Central Bureau's "Letter to Party Members" are.

    In the land reform, the landlords and bad elements in Leikou Village were unable to openly and legally strike at the peasant movement. Therefore, they adopted even more despicable methods, pretending to be active in joining the Party, luring lackeys to seize leadership of the branch, putting the label of "special agent" on the heads of peasants, and murdering the village head who was from a poor peasant background. Such incidents are probably not limited to Anyang, and all localities should be vigilant. In the past, some of our comrades, upon mentioning a Communist Party member or branch, immediately held a sectarian view of "one of us," a "member of the family." In the Party, they did not primarily view people and matters from the fundamental class standpoint and class interests. Consequently, they lost class vigilance, allowing landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements to exploit this "one of us" loophole to harm genuine members of our own ranks. Chairman Mao said well in his report "The Present Situation and Our Tasks": "That is, many landlord elements, rich peasant elements, and hooligan elements take the opportunity to infiltrate our Party. In the countryside, they control the Party's, government's, and mass organizations, act like tyrants, oppress the people, distort the Party's policies, alienate these organizations from the masses, and make land reform impossible." The Leikou incident in Anyang is a typical illustration.

    We completely agree with the Anyang County Committee's decision to dissolve the branch. We should also organize people's tribunals in the land redistribution movement, severely punish these criminals, and hand them over to the people for trial. All those responsible for the incident should simultaneously conduct self-reflection and self-examination, expose weaknesses in all aspects, and better complete the reorganization of the ranks.

　　磊口事件的教训
    安阳磊口村支部被地主富农混进来，瓦解农民翻身运动，逼死贫农出身的村长，造成极可痛心的损失。从这件事，也可以深刻认识到毛主席整编党的队伍的号召和中央局发表的告党员书是多么英明。
    磊口村地主坏蛋在土地改革中无法公开的合法的打击农民运动，于是采取更卑鄙办法，假装积极混进党内，拉拢狗腿夺取了支部领导权，用特务的帽子扣在农民头上，杀害了贫农出身的村长。象这样一类事，恐不仅安阳有，各地均值得警惕。过去我们有些同志一提共产党员或是支部，便立刻有一种“一家人”、“自己人”的宗派看法，在党内看人看事多不以根本的阶级立场阶级利益为出发点，以致丧失了阶级警惕，使地主富农坏蛋钻了这个“自己人”的空子，来残害真正的自己人。毛主席在“目前形势和我们的任务”报告中说的好：“这即是有许多地主分子，富农分子，流氓分子乘机混进我们的党。他们在农村把持党的政府的与民众团体的组织，作威作福欺压人民，歪曲党的政策，使这些组织脱离群众，使土地改革不能彻底”，安阳磊口事件正是一个典型的说明。
    我们完全同意安阳县委解散该支部的办法，还应在平分土地运动中组织人民法庭，严厉惩办这些犯人，交付人民审判；一切与事件有关的责任者应同时进行自我反省和检查，暴露各方面弱点，更好的来完成整编队伍。
