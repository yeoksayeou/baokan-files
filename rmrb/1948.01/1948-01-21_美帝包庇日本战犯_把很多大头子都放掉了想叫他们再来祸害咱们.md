　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Tokyo dispatch: One of the major Japanese war criminals, fascist warlord Hideki Tojo, has become increasingly arrogant since arriving at the Far East International Tribunal on December 26th of last year, under the protection of MacArthur. In his lengthy and absurd 60,000-word defense, he claimed that he "did not commit any crimes," and even whitewashed the Japanese寇's (a derogatory term for Japanese invaders) aggression against China and the launch of the Pacific War as being of a "self-defense" and "defensive" nature. Tojo also repeatedly defended the Emperor and other Japanese war criminals. The reason why Tojo and other war criminals dare to be so arrogant is due to MacArthur's protection and indulgence. MacArthur not only delayed sentencing Tojo and others, but even gave Tojo and 24 other major war criminals a "Japanese-style Christmas dinner" on the eve of the trial, treating them like honored guests. It is to be noted that Hideki Tojo once held the military posts of Commander of the Kwantung Army Gendarmerie, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, and Chief of Staff. He served as Minister of the Army in the Konoe Cabinet in 1941, and later as Prime Minister. He was the planner and actual executor of the Japanese寇's (a derogatory term for Japanese invaders) aggressive wars such as the "September 18th Incident," the "July 7th Incident," and the Pacific War. It is also reported that, under MacArthur's reactionary measures to support the resurgence of Japanese aggressive forces, following the release of 23 major war criminals on August 30th of last year, including Yoshisuke Ayukawa (military industrial tycoon), Chikuhei Nakajima (known as the king of the Japanese aircraft industry), and Senjuro Masakio (Army General), four more war criminals have recently been unconditionally released, including Masataka Ota (member of the Japanese House of Representatives, executive director of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association, and general director of the Greater Japan Political Association) and Shozo Kawabe (Director of the Army Education General Supervision Department).
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Tokyo dispatch: The chief prosecutor of the Far East International Tribunal (representative of US imperialism), Keenan, has recommended to Washington the release of 21 major Japanese war criminals awaiting trial. These include the former Foreign Minister, Teijiro Toyoda, who was an executioner in the invasion of China (note: he was a naval admiral, Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Second Konoe Cabinet in April 1941, and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Colonial Affairs concurrently in the Third Konoe Cabinet from July to October of the same year, and Minister of Munitions in the Suzuki Cabinet from April 1945 until the surrender), the former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese寇's (a derogatory term for Japanese invaders) Combined Fleet, Sankichi Takahashi, the former Commander of the Japanese寇's (a derogatory term for Japanese invaders) North China Garrison Army, Jun Tada, and the former spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, fascist bureaucrat Eiji Amau (note: he issued the Amau Doctrine of monopolizing China on April 17, 1934). In addition, five cabinet members from the Tojo Cabinet will also be released. The Chinese people cannot tolerate the indignant anger towards the war-monger MacArthur’s reactionary policy of condoning the Japanese寇 (a derogatory term for Japanese invaders) to bring disaster to East Asia again.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Sydney dispatch: Australian correspondent in Japan, Stanley, recently published an article in the "Sunday Sun" here, sharply criticizing MacArthur's delay in the trial of major Japanese war criminals. The article stated that, due to adherence to procedural issues, the trial has become a ridiculous waste of time, energy, and money. Stanley pointed out that since Tojo began his self-defense and directly distributed his defense materials through his lawyers, the defense materials have become the most direct and unhidden anti-Allied, mainly anti-Soviet, propaganda. The defense lawyers and ordinary Japanese are making full use of anti-Soviet sentiment because they believe that anti-Soviet sentiment is very popular in MacArthur's headquarters. Stanley continued that since the Far East International Tribunal began its work, MacArthur has adopted a protective attitude towards Japanese war criminals. Stanley also criticized the Australian government's erroneous policy of following US imperialism on this issue in the conclusion.

　　美帝包庇日本战犯
  　把很多大头子都放掉了想叫他们再来祸害咱们
    【新华社陕北十五日电】东京讯：日本主要战犯之一法西斯军阀东条英机，自去年十二月二十六日抵远东国际法庭后，在麦克阿瑟庇护下，态度愈益蛮横，他在长达六万字荒谬狂妄的辩词中，自称“并未犯任何罪行”，竟把日寇进攻中国及发动太平洋战争等侵略暴行，粉饰为“自卫”“防御”性质。东条并一再为天皇及日本其他战犯狡辩。东条等战犯之所以敢于如此狂妄，实为麦克阿瑟包庇纵容所致。麦克阿瑟对东条等不仅延缓判罪，且竟于开庭前夕仍给东条等二十四名战争主犯以“日本式之圣诞晚餐”，待如贵宾。按东条英机曾任关东军宪兵司令官、关东军副参谋长、参谋长等军职，一九四一年近卫内阁时任陆相，后任首相，系“九、一八事变”、“七、七事变”、太平洋战争等日寇侵略战争之策动者，及实际执行人。另悉：在麦克阿瑟扶植日本侵略势力再起的反动措施下，继去年八月三十日释放鲇川义介（军需财阀）、中岛知久平（号称日本飞机业大王）、真崎甚三郎（陆军大将）等二十三名主要战犯之后，最近又将太田正孝（日众议院议员、翼赞政治会常务总务、大日本政治会总务）、河边正三（陆军教育总监部部长）等四名战犯无条件释放。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】东京讯：远东国际法庭首席检察官（美帝国主义代表）季楠，已向华盛顿建议释放待审之日本主要战犯二十一名。其中包括侵华刽子手前外相丰田贞次郎（按系海军大将，一九四一年四月间任近卫二次内阁商工大臣，同年七月至十月，任近卫三次内阁外相兼拓务大臣，四五年四月至投降前，任铃木内阁军需大臣），前日寇联合舰队司令长官高桥三吉，前日寇华北驻屯军司令官多田骏，前日外务省发言人法西斯官僚天羽英二（按他曾于一九三四年四月十七日发表独占中国之天羽声明），此外东条内阁时期五名阁员亦将获释。战争贩子麦克阿瑟此种纵容日寇重行祸害东亚之反动政策，中国人民莫不对此表示不能容忍之激愤。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】悉尼讯：澳驻日记者斯坦莱，顷于此间“星期太阳报”著文，尖锐抨击麦克阿瑟对日本主要战犯的延缓审判。文称：由于拘守程序问题，审讯变成了时间、精力和金钱可笑的浪费。斯氏指出：自从东条自行辩护并通过其辩护人直接散发辩护材料以来，该项辩护材料已成为最率直无隐的反同盟国、主要是反苏联的宣传。辩护人和一般日本人充分利用着反苏情绪，因为他们相信，反苏情绪在麦克阿瑟总部是大受欢迎的。斯氏继称：自从远东国际法庭开始工作以来，麦克阿瑟对日本战犯即采取庇护态度。斯氏在结论中亦抨击了澳洲政府对此问题采取尾随美帝国主义的错误政策。
