　　【Taihang News】After receiving the Land Law Outline, the Shengsi Camel Village in the Eighth District of She County, in order to allow the hired laborers and poor peasants to understand and master it first, to prevent landlords and rich peasants from taking advantage of loopholes, spreading rumors, distorting the law, and launching counterattacks, convened more than forty hired peasants and poor peasants to read it to them first. During the reading, the hired laborers and poor peasants listened attentively and offered some suggestions. Chen Wantian said: "This method is good, but I have an objection to the method of giving landlords a share. Giving is necessary, but they must hand over everything they have exploited from us and bow their heads. The landlords in our village eat and dress better than us and have never suffered a day. We can't give them a share first.” Duan Xifang continued: "That's right! My family has always used manual labor to grind flour, for five generations. The landlords use animals. It won't be fair unless we clean them out first and then give them a share.” Ma Baoan said: "In the past, we suffered, we were treated like donkeys. Even now the landlords in our village are still better off than us! This time when delivering public grain, we still carry it like donkeys, while the landlords and rich peasants use good animals to carry it, and they don't carry anything themselves. I don't agree with giving them a share first in this situation. Only after a thorough reckoning can we give them a share." Ma Qitang said: "The landlords and rich peasants haven't bowed their heads yet. Ma Sanyuan, a landlord in our village, is still having affairs and scolding the masses, saying, 'You sons of bitches struggled against me, and even after I die, I'll still get you sons of bitches.' If they don't bow their heads, we can't give them a share first.” All forty-plus hired laborers and poor peasants felt the same way. Their second opinion was: Our village is a poor village, with an average of less than two mu of bad land per person. When dividing the land equally, we need to immigrate to wealthier villages, or we won't be able to turn ourselves around.

　　先将地主斗透才能给他一份
  　圣寺驼贫雇研究土地法
    【太行消息】涉县八区圣寺驼村，在收到土地法大纲后，为了先让雇贫知道和掌握，以防地主富农钻空造谣曲解和反攻，就召集了四十多个雇贫农民，先念给他们听。在念的当中，雇贫很专心听，并随着提了些意见。陈万田说：“这个办法就是好，可是给地主分一份的办法，我有意见，分是要分，可总得叫他们把剥削咱的东西拿干净，低了头才行。象咱村地主，都比咱吃的好穿的好，一天罪也没受过，可不能先分。”段西方接着说：“对！我家磨面总是人推，推了五辈了，到如今还是人推。人家地主还是用牲口推。不弄干净，就不能给他分。”马保安说：“过去咱受罪，咱当驴，现在咱村地主还是比咱得劲哩！这次送公粮，咱还是当驴担哩，地主富农赶好着牲口驮着不担，他们一天罪也没受。象这样就先分给他一份，我就不同意。就是先清算彻底了，才能给他们分。”马起堂说：“地主富农就是还没有低头，咱村地主马三元还搞破鞋，还骂群众说：“你狗日们斗了我，死了也得搞了你狗们，象这样不低头，就不能先给他分。”四十多个雇贫意见都是这样。他们的第二个意见是：咱这村是个穷村，每人平均不到二亩坏地，平分时得往富村移民，要不就翻不透身。
