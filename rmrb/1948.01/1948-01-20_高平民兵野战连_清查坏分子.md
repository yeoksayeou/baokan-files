　　Gaoping Militia Field Company
  　Purges Bad Elements
    [Taiyue News] In the December training of the Gaoping Fifth District militia field company, after conducting investigations into class background, ideology, and feudalistic thinking, twenty-two bad eggs, including Niu Quanyang, Liu Jihai, and Shen Sikong, were identified and expelled. Niu Quanyang, from Tuanchi West, joined the Miaodao Society in 1940, and in 1941, he joined the bandit Ji Zhenkui's gang. In January 1945, he became a member of the Japanese puppet police force, wholeheartedly engaging in traitorous activities. He followed the Japanese devils from Gaoping to Luan and Qin counties, looting, making a fortune, and even bullying women. After we liberated Qin County, he fled to Yan Xishan's bandit troops, continuing to harm the people. Last October, he returned from Pingyao and infiltrated the militia. Only now has he been exposed. Guo Jihai, the director of the Guo Village Military Committee, was also a major bad egg. He had served in Yan Xishan's army for three years. After returning, he smoked opium, frequented prostitutes, engaged in improper conduct, shielded targets of struggle, embezzled the fruits of struggle, oppressed good people, and sabotaged weapons. He had already expelled eight hired poor peasants from the militia alone. He also took advantage of his position as director of the Military Committee to rape women. After this training, these bad eggs were purged, and everyone's class consciousness was raised. Xu Xiangze said, "The militia is the armed force of us poor people. We won't let these bad guys mix in. We must thoroughly cleanse out the bad eggs and control the knives ourselves."

　　高平民兵野战连
  　清查坏分子
    【太岳消息】高平五区在十二月训练民兵野战连中，进行了查阶级、查思想、查封建，就查出了牛全羊、刘计孩、申思恭等廿二个坏蛋，一齐将他们开除。牛全羊是团池西人，廿九年参加过庙道会，三十年又加入土匪姬镇魁的队伍，三十四年正月又当日寇警备队，一心一意干汉奸的事情。跟日本鬼子从高平到潞安、沁县抢东西、发洋财、还欺侮妇女。咱们打下了沁县，就逃到阎锡山的土匪队伍里，还是遭害老百姓。去年十月从平遥回来，就混进了民兵里，这次才把他查出来。郭庄武委会主任郭计孩也是个大坏蛋，也在阎锡山那里当过三年兵，回来后吃洋烟、嫖女人不正干，还包庇斗争对象，贪污斗争果实，压迫好人，破坏武器，光从民兵里就开除了八个雇贫。还仗着武委会主任威风，强奸妇女。经过这次训练就清洗了这些坏蛋，大家阶级觉悟提高了，如许像则说：“民兵是咱们穷人的武装，不让这些坏家伙混进来，咱们要彻底清洗坏蛋，自己来掌握刀把。”
