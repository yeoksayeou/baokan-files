　　【This Newspaper News】The Land Law promulgated by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party means to mobilize poor and hired peasants to unite with middle peasants, confiscate and distribute the land and all property of landlords, and extract the surplus from rich peasants for thorough and equal distribution. This matter is beneficial to all peasants. However, landlords, rich peasants, and some bad elements have come out to make trouble, deliberately spreading rumors and instigating lavish eating and drinking:
　　Yan Zhushan, a landlord in Dagang Village, Seventh District of She County, and his two brothers, upon seeing the Land Law, thought that they would be given a share and could avoid struggle. They then cut down production trees (including one persimmon tree, one timber tree, five Chinese prickly ash trees, and five pepper trees) that the masses had left for their livelihood. The masses discovered this and immediately confiscated the trees they had cut down, and said to him: "The knife handle of the Land Law is in our hands, it has nothing to do with you." This approach is very correct. If they were allowed to develop, the problem would become serious. In Tian Er Zhuang, Wu'an, they did not quickly recognize this conspiracy. When they discovered the rumor saying: "Everything will be equally divided, even foot bindings will be divided," and did not immediately trace the source and stop it, the middle peasants were affected and killed five sheep during the Gregorian New Year and ate and drank lavishly by making dumplings. Later, after explaining the outline of the Land Law, saying that the movable property of middle peasants would not be touched, but that wealthy middle peasants would have to give up land, and some middle peasants would get land, the mood began to stabilize.
　　The village chief of Sanwang Village in Wu'an, while eating and drinking lavishly himself, also said: "Now it is equalizing land, and in the future, houses, farm tools, and livestock will slowly have to be equalized, and we will implement communism by eating from a big pot." He also said: "It is good to eat from a big pot, it is difficult to manage a small family, it is better to be together so that everyone is not restrained." This kind of thinking reveals resistance to equal distribution. He deliberately distorts the Land Law to say that it is eating from a big pot. Saying this, the middle peasants and poor peasants will misunderstand; he can then exploit loopholes. Therefore, if we do not expose this kind of statement after hearing it, we will be fooled.

### 挑动大吃大喝　就是破坏土地法

　　挑动大吃大喝
  　就是破坏土地法
    【本报消息】中国共产党中央公布的土地法，他的意思是发动贫雇农起来团结中农，没收分配地主的土地和一切财产，及抽出富农的多余部分，实行彻底平分，这件事情，对全体农民都有好处。地主富农及一些坏分子却出来捣乱，故意造谣生事，挑动大吃大喝：
    涉县七区大港村地主阎祝山弟兄二人看到土地法，以为要分给他们一份，可以不斗了，便砍了群众留给他生活的生产树（计有柿树一棵，木料树一棵，楸树五棵，椒树五棵）。群众发现马上便把他砍的树没收了，并且对他说：“土地法刀把子在我们手里，与你无干。”这种做法很对，如果让他发展，问题就严重了。武安田二庄就因为没有很快警觉这种阴谋，当发现谣传说：“要大平分，裹脚布都要分。”没有立即追根制止，中农就受了影响，过阳历年杀了五个羊，包饺子大吃大喝起来。后来经过对土地法大纲的解释说中农的浮财不动，只是富裕中农要拿出土地，还有的中农要分得土地，情绪才开始安定下来。
    武安三王村村长他一面自己大吃大喝，一面又说：“现在是均土地，往后就房子、农具、牲口慢慢啥也得均了，就实行共产起大锅。”还说：“起大锅也好，一个小家时光可作难咧，伙起来大家不受制。”这种想法说透了就是抵抗平分，他故意曲解土地法说是吃大锅，这样说的结果，中农、贫农都要起误会；他就可以钻空子了。所以听到这种说法后，咱们不揭发就要上当。
