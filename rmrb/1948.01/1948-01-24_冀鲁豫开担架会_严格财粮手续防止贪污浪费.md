　　[Ji-Lu-Yu News] The Ji-Lu-Yu Rear Headquarters, when holding a forum for stretcher-bearer cadres, proposed strictly reviewing financial and grain procedures to prevent embezzlement and waste. In the past, the leadership was not strict or attentive enough to the procedures for stretcher-bearer and civilian laborers' firewood and grain expenses, leading to serious embezzlement and waste. After the cadres from the Huangdian District of Dingtao who were in charge of stretcher-bearers returned to their district, they had a big meal at the Huangdian market, spending 20,000 yuan and seeking reimbursement from the headquarters. They also planned to sell and divide up more than 800 jin of millet that had been left over from the last stretcher duty. Some districts even treated the surplus provisions for stretcher-bearers and civilian laborers as a surplus of their own agency and used it to improve their living standards. The reasons for the surplus were: (1) Cadres who were detached from production received provisions along with the civilian laborers, saving the firewood and grain that they had already received from their original agency. (2) The firewood and grain rations for sick, straggling, and deserting personnel were still claimed as usual. (3) Before the date when provisions were due, they were re-claimed because they had been transferred to another agency or unit. (4) The lamp oil fees issued to stretcher-bearers and civilian laborers for marching at night were rarely used. When returning after completing their mission, the civilian laborers were eager to go home, which reduced the marching time, and the issued firewood and grain coupons were not used up. Based on the above reasons, it was decided to thoroughly review the past procedures for the stretcher-bearers' and civilian laborers' expenses, strictly implement the procedures, and conduct spot checks on the number of stretcher-bearers to eliminate embezzlement and waste.

　　冀鲁豫开担架会
  　严格财粮手续防止贪污浪费
    【冀鲁豫消息】冀鲁豫后方总指挥部，召开担架干部座谈会时，提出严格清理财粮手续，防止贪污浪费。过去领导上对担架民工柴粮开支手续不够严格和注意，以致发生了严重的贪污浪费现象。定陶黄店区带担架的干部回到本区后，到黄店集上大吃一顿，费洋两万元，到指挥部报销；并准备把上次担架节余的小米八百余斤卖掉瓜分。还有的区把节余的担架、民工给养当成本机关节余，改善生活。节余的原因：（一）脱离生产的干部随着民工领给养，节省了自己原机关已领的柴粮。（二）病号掉队逃亡减员之空额柴粮，照常支领。（三）未到应领日期，因转拨另一机关部队使用而重领。（四）晚上行军领的担架民工灯油费很少用着。完成任务回来时，民工归家心切，减少了行军时间，所发之柴粮票用不完。根据以上原因，确定对已往担架民工支借手续，进行彻底清理，并严格手续，抽查担架人数，以杜绝贪污和浪费。
