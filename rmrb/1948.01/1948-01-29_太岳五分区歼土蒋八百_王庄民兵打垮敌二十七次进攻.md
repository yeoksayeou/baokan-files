[Taiyue News] The local troops of the Fifth Military Sub-district have successively annihilated over 800 Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. On the 2nd of this month, the local corps and local armed forces ambushed Zhang Diankui's bandit gang of over 500 people in Xiaoshijie, northwest of Luoning, killing and wounding more than 20. On the 3rd, another 500+ bandits attacked again, but were killed by us for 50+. On the 4th, in the Wangyuegou area of Yiyang, we captured two men, including a squad leader of Feng Kegong's bandit gang, seizing two rifles and pistols. On the 5th, we took advantage of the victory to conduct a three-pronged suppression of bandits in the Xiaogou, Miaoxia, and Magou areas of Yiyang, largely destroying the bandit secret service organization Miaodaohui, killing more than 150 and wounding more than 30. We also killed 188 bandits and wounded 6 in Gucun, Sanxiang, and captured more than 30 alive. On the 8th, the Xin'an militia completely eliminated the bandits in Wangtou Village, capturing more than 30 alive. On the 11th, we advanced to suppress bandits in Xiaoshijie, scattering Wang Diankui's hundred-plus men, killing and wounding more than 20, and capturing four alive. On the 12th, we continued to suppress bandits in Shicun and Wangcun, killing and wounding more than 20 bandits, and once recovered the city of Mianchi, scaring away the defending bandits. On the 15th, we advanced to suppress bandits in Yancun again, killing 15 bandits, capturing more than 60 alive, and seizing three rifles. On the 16th, we suppressed bandits in Sanxiang again, killing more than 50 bandits, including the bandit leader Chen Yuqi, and capturing more than 50 alive, seizing five rifles. On the 19th, we besieged the bandit gangs of Gao Shangxin, Ye Laowu, and Ye Laoliu in Shuichi, Shangxiaying, and captured more than 100 bandits, landlords, and local bullies alive, seizing 11 rifles, two pistols, and one horse.

[Taiyue News] Northeast of Xin'an, western Henan, there is a mountain range called Wangzhuang, which is an important place to control the Xishiwu ferry crossing on the Yellow River. Therefore, the local bandits and Chiang troops often come to compete for it, but they have been repelled by the KuangKou villagers' militia. On the 15th of this month, they repelled the 27th attack by the local bandits and Chiang troops. That morning, the local bandits and Chiang troops from Xin'an and Mengjin attacked Wangzhuang in three routes. One route of more than 100 people, with a machine gun, attacked from the Genfengzui stockade on the left side of Wangzhuang; another route of more than 80 people, with two machine guns, occupied the Zushimiao high ground 20 miles southeast of Wangzhuang, using firepower to cover another route of more than 200 people attacking from the front. At this time, the KuangKou militia captain Guo Yi and others resisted, fighting fiercely. Although a militiaman, Chen Dahong, sacrificed himself, everyone did not waver at all. After fighting for more than an hour, they finally defeated the bandits, killing four and wounding 14, including their company commander, and seizing two rifles.
