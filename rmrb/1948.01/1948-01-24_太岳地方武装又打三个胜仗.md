【Taiyue News】The local armed forces of the First Military Subdistrict have won two more victories. On the early morning of December 30th, our troops ambushed the enemy's "Self-Defense Corps" near Dongxi Buyi Village, more than 30 li south of Pingyao. The bandits came out of Xiquan to loot grain and fell into our ambush, and we captured more than ten of them alive. That night, the Third Detachment of the Model Guerrilla Team in Jiexiu went to attack the Jiexiu Railway Station, captured three members of the bandit police station alive, and obtained a telephone. We suffered no casualties.
【Taiyue News】The Jiexiu Independent Battalion, in coordination with the District Detachment's Rotation Team, fought a good battle. On January 14th, more than 60 men from the 6th Company of the 18th Regiment of the Bandit Security Forces in Nanwangli, divided into two groups, went to Donghulong Village to loot grain. One group entered the village from the north gate, and the other from the west gate. As soon as they entered the village, Zhang Sanhu, the commander of our 2nd Company, threw out two hand grenades, and the assault team bravely charged at the enemy. A volley of hand grenades scattered the enemy, who turned around and ran. As they fled the village, they were intercepted by our troops ambushed outside the village. After a hearty 15-minute battle, we killed four of them, wounded twelve, and captured eighteen alive, including a squad leader. We seized three machine guns, thirteen rifles, five hundred rounds of ammunition, and 700,000 yuan in legal tender. We suffered a total of three killed and wounded.
【Taiyue News】Explosions have started in Xin'an, Western Henan, and the first shot has already been fired. On December 29th, Li Huailiang, He Guilin, and Zhang Yunzi led the militia to Zhangguanling, where they buried nineteen mines. On the morning of January 1st, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Zhang Bohua's troops and the Chiang-appointed Qinyang Brigade menacingly went to Ganquan Village to loot grain. They stepped on a stone mine, killing one and wounding two. They dared not go any further and quickly turned around and fled.
