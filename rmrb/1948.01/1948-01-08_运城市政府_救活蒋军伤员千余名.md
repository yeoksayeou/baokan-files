　　Yuncheng Municipal Government
  　Saves More Than 1,000 Wounded Kuomintang Soldiers
    [This newspaper's front-line dispatch from Southern Shanxi, 4th] After the Yuncheng Democratic Municipal Government entered the city with the army, it saved more than 1,000 wounded soldiers abandoned by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Around many bunkers and fortifications, the abandoned officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's 369th Regiment, 250th Regiment, and 182nd Regiment were all innocent victims sacrificed for Chiang Kai-shek. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit's superior officers did not pity them at all. During the days of battle, they were not given treatment or food. They lay beside the bunkers, suffering from hunger and cold, crying for their parents. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits attempted to flee, they abandoned them. After our Democratic Municipal Government entered the city, it immediately sent them to the Gospel Hospital and established the "Office for Rescuing Abandoned Wounded Enemy Soldiers," dispatching doctors to treat them day and night and explaining the People's Liberation Army's policy of treating prisoners of war with leniency. The wounded soldiers were moved to tears, praising our Democratic Municipal Government as their savior. Many regretted saying, "If we had known the People's Liberation Army was this good, why would we have been trapped in the isolated city and acted as cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek?"

　　运城市政府
  　救活蒋军伤员千余名
    【本报晋南前线四日电】运城民主市政府随军入城后，救活了蒋匪抛弃的伤员一千多人。在许多碉堡工事周围蒋匪三六九团、二五○团、一八二团被抛弃的官兵，都是为蒋介石的无辜牺牲者。蒋匪上级军官并不可惜他们，战斗的几天中没有给治疗，没有给吃饭，躺在碉堡旁边，饥寒交迫，呼爹唤娘，最后蒋匪企图逃窜时，就把他们抛弃了。我民主市政府入城后，当即把他们送进福音医院，成立“招扶敌弃伤兵处”，派医生日夜治疗，并讲解解放军优待俘虏政策，伤员们感激涕零，称赞我民主市政府为救命恩人，许多人都懊恼的说：“早知道解放军这样好，何必困守孤城替蒋介石当炮灰。”
