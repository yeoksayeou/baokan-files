[Taihang News] After rectification, the Huguan Nitrate Workshop's nitrate production in the last two months has exceeded the plan by half. The county originally had twenty nitrate workshops. Around August last year, the relationship between the nitrate workshops and the masses deteriorated, and they became disconnected from the masses' production in nitrate boiling. As a result, thirteen workshops were shut down. The remaining ones were on the verge of collapse because the masses were dissatisfied with the workshops' "failure to pay for ash" and refused to hand it over. The original plan for August and September was to boil 20,000 jin of nitrate, but only a little over 8,500 jin were produced. Later, in September, a mass-based rectification was carried out with full force, and corrupt managers like Gao Haiming, who held economic power, were removed. Everyone's enthusiasm for work became very high. Shen Ren, a technical worker who watched the pot at the Dongguanbi Nitrate Workshop, was originally a landlord and did not want to work hard. In September, sometimes he would boil three pots and not produce even one tael of nitrate, producing at most 200 jin a month. After the rectification in September, a poor peasant named Chang Shui was hired to learn how to watch the pot properly. He produced 800 jin a month, with each pot producing fifteen or sixteen jin of nitrate per day. Some workshops also implemented a work-point system with profit sharing. For example, the Jidian Nitrate Workshop previously gave everyone the same amount of work points, regardless of how much work they did, or even if they didn't work at all, so everyone's morale was very low, and they could only boil 200 jin a month. After rectification, everyone formulated a new system of recording work points, with fixed and flexible aspects, and a profit-sharing method: if a pot watcher could boil more than 30 jin of nitrate a day and also do odd jobs, they could earn twelve work points, with an extra half point for each additional jin and a half point deducted for each jin less. A nitrate scraper could earn ten work points for scraping six loads a day; transporting back four loads from three li away, or two loads from five li away, would also earn ten work points, with one extra point for each additional load scraped (one point deducted for each load less), and two extra points for each additional load transported (two points deducted for each load less). At the end of the month, profits were distributed according to work points. After this method was implemented, it greatly encouraged everyone's production enthusiasm, and the workshop boiled 700 jin of nitrate in one month. The relationship between the nitrate workshops and the masses has also improved since then. After the rectification of the Xincun Nitrate Workshop, they collected even three or five jin of ash, paying for it at the current price at any time. In the past, the government dispatched ash and special personnel urged its delivery, but it was still not enough. Now, the masses automatically deliver ash, and in addition to having enough for their own use, they also helped the Nanguan Nitrate Workshop with more than 2,000 jin of ash. Currently, since the rectification of all the nitrate workshops in the county, the number of pots has increased from twenty-six to forty-seven. Each pot now boils one hundred and seventy-six jin more nitrate per month than in the past (each pot boiled two hundred jin of nitrate in October). According to statistics for November and December, nearly 30,000 jin of nitrate were boiled, more than twice as much as in August and September, exceeding the original target by half, a total of more than 9,800 jin. The nitrate workers also earned an extra 108,000 jin of rice.

　　壶关硝坊经过整顿产量超出计划一半
    【太行消息】壶关硝坊经过整顿后，最近两个月熬硝生产超出计划一半。全县原有二十座硝坊，去年八月前后，硝坊与群众关系恶劣，在熬硝上和群众生产脱节，因此，就有十三座停顿啦。剩下的因为群众不满硝坊“收灰不付钱”，拒绝交灰，也差一点要垮台，八、九两月原计划熬硝两万斤，结果只熬出八千五百多斤。以后在九月里，全力进行了群众性的整顿，并清除了掌着经济大权的贪污经理高海明等，大家干的劲头便很大。东关壁硝坊，原来看锅的技术工人申仁是个地主，不想好好干，九月份有时熬三锅还不产一两硝，一月顶多产二百斤；九月整顿后，雇贫常水掌学习好好看锅，一月就产到八百斤，每天一锅能出十五六斤硝。有的并实行了记工分红制度。比如集店硝坊，以前不管做活多少，甚至在一天不做活，也要顶工，大家情绪很低，一月只能熬二百斤。经过整顿，大家订出新的死分活记的记工制度和分红办法：看锅的一天如能熬出三十多斤硝，并捎带打杂，就可顶十二分工，多出一斤加半分，少出一斤减半分。刮硝工人一日刮六担顶十分，三里远运回四担，或五里远运回两担，都顶十分工，多刮一担多顶一分（少刮一担减一分），多运一担多顶两分（少运一担减两分）；月底按工分红。这个办法实行后，便大大鼓励了大家的生产积极性，该坊一月就熬出了七百斤硝。各硝坊和群众的关系从此也作了改善。辛村硝坊整顿后，三斤五斤灰都收，按时价随时开钱，过去是政府派灰、专人催送、还不够用，现在是群众自动送灰，除自己足够用外，还帮助了南关硝坊两千多斤灰。现全县硝坊自从整顿后，最近锅由二十六口增到四十七口，每月每口锅比过去多熬硝一百七十六斤（十月份每口锅熬二百斤硝）据十一、十二两月统计，共熬出近三万斤硝，比八、九两月超出两倍还多，超过原定任务一半，计九千八百多斤，硝工们也多赚米十万零八千多斤。
