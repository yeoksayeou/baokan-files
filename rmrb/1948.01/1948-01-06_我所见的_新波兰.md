　　What I Saw – New Poland
　　By Anna Louise Strong, translated by Li Dihua
　　New Democratic Poland is the most typical country in Eastern Europe to carry out land reform. This once-famous country of large landowners has now taken on a new look, and the oppressed and exploited poor peasants have completely turned over and become the masters of the land.
　　This book uses a large amount of space to write about the land reform situation in Poland. These facts were personally witnessed by the famous journalist Anna Louise Strong. She personally watched how Polish peasants established peasant committees; she personally watched how Polish peasants divided classes; how they evenly distributed land.
　　Today, as we are carrying out land reform, this is an extremely valuable reference book. The entire book is more than 100,000 words, and has been translated by Comrade Li Dihua, and proofread by many people. The translation is smooth and easy to understand, and this is the first publication by our bookstore.
　　This book also truthfully narrates the heroic struggle of the Polish people to eliminate Hitler, and how the Polish government-in-exile, under the instigation of the United States and Britain, plunged millions of people in Warsaw into tragic death. The author wrote in detail about the inside story of the so-called "Warsaw Uprising." Therefore, this book is also the best book for understanding the international situation in recent years and the situation of new democratic countries.

　　我所见的——新波兰
    美·斯特朗著  李棣华译
    新民主主义的波兰，是东欧进行土地改革最典型的国家。这个著名的大地主所有国，现在已经面目一新，受压迫受剥削的贫苦农民，完全翻身，做了土地的主人。
    这本书便是用了大量篇幅，来写波兰土地改革情况的。这些事实，又是名记者斯特朗亲自看见的。她亲自看着波兰农民如何成立农民委员会；她亲自看着波兰农民如何划分阶级；如何平均分配土地。
    在我们进行土地改革的今天，这是极有价值的一部参考书。全书十余万言，已由李棣华同志译出，并经多人校正，译文流畅通俗，由本店第一次出版。
    这本书里并如实的叙述了波兰人民为消灭希特勒的英勇斗争，和波兰流亡政府如何在美、英的支使下，陷华沙数百万人民于悲惨死亡，所谓“波兰起义”等，作者都详细的写出了它的内幕。故本书又是一部了解近年国际情况、了解新民主主义国家情况的最好书籍。
