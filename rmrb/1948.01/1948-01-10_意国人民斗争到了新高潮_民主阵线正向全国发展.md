　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 6th: A comprehensive report from Rome states that the Italian People's Democratic Front movement is expanding throughout Italy. Local committees of the People's Democratic Front have been established in major cities such as Turin, Genoa, Milan, Pescara, and Florence to unite all democratic mass organizations in various regions. It is expected that such committees will be established in many other cities soon. According to TASS, many representatives from right-wing parties in Italy, such as the Republican Party, the Saragat Party, and the Christian Democratic Party, are also participating in these committees. Meanwhile, the Italian Women's League was also established in Rome on the 30th of last month, calling on Italian women to participate in the People's Democratic Front to fight for various women's rights. The democratic forces in Italy are now unprecedentedly strong. According to Longo, one of the leaders of the Italian Communist Party, who recently recalled his experience in leading the underground resistance movement, "The most serious blow we dealt to fascist Nazis was not only armed struggle, but also the mass actions of millions of workers, who were as united as one person." Longo emphasized, "For the current purpose, today we can also prevent any reactionary will and the intentions of American imperialism and its Italian lackeys from being realized, and we can implement measures and regulations that they are unwilling to implement."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 8th: Moscow News: An analyst for Pravda, commenting on the establishment of the People's Democratic Front in Italy, stated: The People's Democratic Front founding assembly, held on December 28, 1947, for labor, peace, freedom, and national independence, will occupy the most important place in Italy's post-war history. The establishment of this front is a major success in uniting all genuinely democratic forces of the Italian people. It represents a new climax in the struggle of the Italian working masses to establish people's democracy and to fight against the combined forces of domestic and foreign reactionaries. The Italian People's Democratic Front is not a coalition of party leadership organs, but a mass-based people's organization, a new form of unity and cooperation among all democratic forces in Italy. The consistent actions of the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party, the initiators and driving forces of the People's Democratic Front, have become the primary condition for the success of the People's Democratic Front. The success of the People's Democratic Front is also due to the establishment of a lasting alliance between the Italian working class and the laboring peasants. The Italian workers' movement has received the support and endorsement of the peasant masses, who share common enemies and common goals. The National Congress of Peasants and Agricultural Workers, held in Bologna on the 21st of last month with the participation of 6,000 representatives, unanimously passed a resolution pointing out that the unity of the urban and rural working people is "the foundation of the invincible power of the people." The establishment of the Italian People's Democratic Front constitutes a new blow to the imperialist camp and will prove that the reactionary coalition group, from Gasperi, the Vatican, Saragat (note: traitor of the Socialist Party) all the way to Cianini (note: leader of the Fascist Party's Common Man's Front—formerly translated as the Common People's Party), attempts to prevent Italy from advancing along the democratic path and reduce it to a colony of American capital; all these conspiracies are doomed to fail.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 6th: Rome News: Demonstrations and strikes broke out again in Italy around the New Year. On January 2nd, 2,000 unemployed agricultural workers in Baselliana and Apo Gozo, Sicily, held demonstrations protesting the delay in issuing unemployment relief funds. The demonstrating workers once repelled police attempts to suppress the demonstration. On the same day, hundreds of unemployed workers blocked traffic on the Ausselia Road near Calaross. Bank employees across Italy went on strike starting on December 31st. The National Federation of Bank Employee Unions put forward a collective bargaining agreement on wages, but it was unreasonably rejected by the Gasperi government. The strike is still ongoing.

　　意国人民斗争到了新高潮
  　民主阵线正向全国发展
    【新华社陕北六日电】综合罗马讯：意大利人民民主阵线运动，正在全意扩展中。在都灵、热那亚、米兰、贝斯加拉及佛罗伦斯诸中心城市，都已成立人民民主阵线的地方委员会，以团结各地一切民主的群众组织。这种委员会，预料最近将在其它许多城市建立起来。据塔斯社讯，意右翼政党如共和党、萨拉盖特党和基督教民主党的代表，参加这种委员会的也不少。同时，意大利妇女联盟也于上月三十日在罗马成立，号召意妇女参加人民民主阵线，以争取妇女的各种权利。意大利民主力量现在已无比壮大，据意共领袖之一隆哥最近在追述领导地下抵抗运动时的经验说：“我们予法西斯纳粹最严重的打击，不仅是武装斗争，而且还在于数百万工人的群众性行动，他们团结得象一个人一样”。隆哥强调指出：“为了当前目的，今天我们也能使任何反动派的意志与美帝国主义及其意大利从仆的意图无法实现，我们能实施他们所不愿实行的措施与规定。”
    【新华社陕北八日电】莫斯科讯：真理报分析家评意大利建立人民民主阵线称：一九四七年十二月二十八日举行的为劳动、和平、自由与国家独立的人民民主阵线成立大会，在意大利战后的历史上，将占有最重要的地位。这一阵线的成立，在集合意大利人民一切真正民主势力上，是一大成功，它表示着意大利劳苦大众为建立人民民主及与国内外反动派联合势力进行斗争之新高潮。意大利人民民主阵线不是党派领导机关的联合，而是一个群众性的人民团体，是意国一切民主势力团结与合作的新形式。人民民主阵线的发起人及推动力量意共与社会党的行动一致，已成为人民民主阵线成功的首要条件。人民民主阵线的成功，也是由于意大利工人阶级和劳动农民建立持久联盟的结果。意大利工人运动得到农民群众的支持及拥护，他们具有共同的敌人与共同的目标。在上月二十一日于波伦亚举行的六千代表参加的农民与农业工人全国大会，曾一致通过决议，指出城乡劳动人民团结一致，是“人民不可战胜的力量之基础。”意大利人民民主阵线的成立，形成了对帝国主义阵营的新打击，并将证明从加斯贝利、梵蒂冈、萨拉盖特（按：社会党之叛徒）一直到齐亚尼尼（按：系法西斯党普通人阵线——过去译平民党——的党魁）的反动联合集团，企图阻止意大利沿民主道路前进，并使之降于美国资本的殖民地的一切阴谋，即将失败。
    【新华社陕北六日电】罗马讯：新年前后，意大利又发生示威及罢工。一月二日，西西里巴塞良纳及阿波哥左，有二千名失业农业工人举行示威，抗议拖延不发失业救济金。示威工人曾一度击退企图镇压示威的警察。同日，数百名失业工人阻止了卡拉洛斯附近奥塞利亚路的交通。意全国各地银行员工，于十二月三十一日起罢工，银行雇员工会全国联合会提出集体谈判工资的契约，但遭加斯贝利政府的无理拒绝，罢工至今仍继续中。
