My Reflection

　　Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, my family was a landlord family. However, after joining the revolution, I was unwilling to reveal my true identity. Therefore, on the cadre appraisal form and personnel statistics form, I always lowered my own status to that of a rich or middle peasant. During the War of Resistance, my family was devastated by the enemy, puppets, and die-hards, and my landlord status declined. I was very happy about this situation, trying to play both sides, feeling lucky. When the landlord class could exist, I was a landlord; when the landlord class was unlucky, I became a poor person! Therefore, during the "Three Check-Ups" campaign, I was numb and indifferent. I thought my family had never been traitors or oppressed anyone, and we weren't part of the ruling class. Economically, we had already been ruined, so there was nothing to investigate. Then I thought, what if the masses are asked whether they hate your family? Or what did you eat growing up? No problem; those from landlord families grew up eating the food of exploitation, and the masses will definitely have opinions about those who ate the food of exploitation. If the masses forgive you, that is a great favor to you, and you should thank them. You shouldn't take it for granted. You should reflect on your landlord ideology, get rid of it, and work more diligently for the people, making amends for your crimes. Only when I thought of this did I realize that being afraid of losing face and unwilling to admit having landlord ideology is like building "air-raid shelters" for the enemy (in your mind), preparing to attack the revolution again when the opportunity arises.

　　Anyone from a landlord background is bound to have landlord ideology. Coming to the revolutionary ranks makes you an unforgivable enemy. How can you do without investigation? I began to realize that investigation was necessary. I discovered my own enemy and presented him to everyone. After several discussions and studies, a fitting charge was determined: the decadent ideology of the landlord class. Everyone unanimously demanded that I eliminate it, but I still felt attached and unconvinced. After more than ten days, I finally understood. The decadent ideology of the ruined landlord class manifests in work as passivity, initial enthusiasm followed by laxity, the idea of "equal shares" in revolutionary benefits, lack of ambition, and anti-leadership thoughts. My passive work performance is: revolutionary work never gets done, but I'm always working every day, procrastinating and comparing myself to others, always feeling that I do more, that I'm too "honest," always feeling that others are deceiving me and that I'm too foolish. When the environment was bad and I was asked to go to enemy-occupied areas to collect grain, I thought they were sending me to be captured by the enemy. This was because I was too honest and capable, so I should be more careful and cunning in the future.

　　My initial enthusiasm followed by laxity in work was because I was eager to improve my position. Once I achieved it or tasted bitterness, I would think, what's the point? It would be more interesting to slack off a little and play the erhu for entertainment. I always felt that being neither too active nor too backward was the most suitable state. I had the idea of "equal shares" in revolutionary benefits. I once secretly took 10,000 yuan from the public funds to use for my family's business. At that time, I thought, I've been in the revolution for so many years, and my family hasn't used a single cent of public funds or eaten a single meal paid for by public funds. What's wrong with using a little bit of public money? I've been running around all these years, is it only worth 10,000 yuan? If I were a hired worker, I would have been given tens of thousands of yuan for living expenses each year. Look, others who participate in the revolution have their entire families supported by the public, receiving more benefits than I do. So what's wrong with me taking a little bit? After years of work, I should have an appropriate position. Others are promoted, but I'm treated unfairly. For several years, I've been working hard and shedding blood for the revolution. I haven't been sitting at home as an ordinary citizen. I only emphasize my own merits and don't reflect on my work and my prestige among the masses. I simply demand a position from the higher authorities, thinking that I'm not responsible for my work because my position is not high enough. If I'm not in that position, I won't concern myself with its affairs. I don't actively offer suggestions and watch the jokes from the sidelines, indulging in liberalism, calling myself a "jack-of-all-trades" cadre, spreading irresponsible remarks. My work is passive and decadent, making some passive comrades even more passive and dragging down some active ones. I also don't trust the higher authorities, complaining that they don't have a sense of position. They have a position and no personal interests because their personal interests are satisfied, so they tell their subordinates to work honestly for them, maintaining their position. Once, Bureau Chief Zhang said, "Let's think back to a few years ago, we were all children. Now we've grown up, who raised us? Wasn't it the revolution that fed us?" I thought to myself, there's no need to say that. The revolution raised us, but I also contributed to the revolution. If there wasn't the strength of us children, would the revolution be so great? There's no need to say all this, I know, no one owes anyone anything. I don't think about how we can unite further and work harder to do a better job, why should we worry about personal gains and losses? Thinking this way, the higher authorities are completely right. But at the time, I just couldn't think that way.

　　Precisely because I haven't gotten rid of the decadent ideology of the ruined landlord class, I've never worked honestly. I'm always worried about gains and losses, considering my own problems. Sometimes I think about working in a bookstore, but I feel that other jobs are too hard. Working in a bookstore makes it easier to get to a big city, and waiting for later enjoyment isn't bad. So I think I should muddle through my work. I deliberately complain to the higher authorities, demand a position, and desire to enjoy a comfortable life. This is my preliminary reflection. (Reprinted from "Workers' Life" of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region)

　　Comrade Feng Yinhen's reflection is like taking a self-portrait, revealing his true face. As he himself said, he is worried about gains and losses, only concerned with personal matters, and always passive towards the revolution and work. What is lacking here is a better understanding of what influence his landlord class origin has had on him. Does he still have some attachment to this class? Is he rebelling against it to serve the people wholeheartedly, or is he clinging to it, continuing to hold a "share" in the revolutionary ranks? If he is determined to rebel, then what was his attitude towards the people in the past? What should it be in the future? He can find a path. Comrade Feng has not been able to forcefully criticize the dirty things he has reflected upon because this line has not been clearly drawn. We hope he will continue to reflect and continue to write about the situation of his reflections.

### 我的反省

专栏：

　　我的反省
    我家里在抗战前是一个地主家庭，可是参加革命后我不愿暴露真面目，所以干部鉴定表上及人员统计表上总把我自己降低到富农中农成份。在抗战当中家庭因为受敌伪顽的摧残，地主成份是破落了，这样情况自己满高兴，两头赶，真侥幸，地主能存在的时候是地主，地主倒霉的时候变成穷人啦！所以在三查的时候自己麻木不仁，我认为家里没当过汉奸，没欺压过人，并非统治人物，在经济方面早已摧毁，没有可查的地方。我又一想，如果要问群众对你家里有没有仇恨？问你吃什么饭长大的？没问题；地主出身的就是吃剥削饭长大的，吃剥削饭长大的群众对你就不会没意见。假若群众对你原谅，那对你是一个莫大的恩施，应当感谢群众才对。不应当处之泰然，应该是追想自己的地主思想，把它去掉好更尽心的来为人民办事，戴罪立功才是。想到这里才认识到，怕丢人的不愿说自己有地主思想，那就等于给敌人（在思想）造“防空洞”，准备有机会再向革命进攻。
    只要是地主出身就一定带有地主思想，到革命阵营来这是不可饶恕的敌人，不查怎会行呢？我开始觉悟到不查不行。我自己发现我的敌人，把敌人摆在大家面前，经过几次的讨论、研究，定了个恰当的罪名，地主的颓废思想，大家一致的要求我将它消灭，可是我还有留恋不服气，经过十来天的工夫，才弄清楚了。破落地主的颓废思想，在工作的表现是消极、前紧后松，革命利益均占的入股思想，不求进取与反上思想。我消极工作的表现是：革命工作做不完，工作还是天天干，歇会推会，常与别人相比，总觉着自己做的多，太“老实”，总觉着别人欺骗自己，自己太傻气。环境不好的时候要我到敌占区催粮，我以为叫我到敌人据点里去做俘虏，这是因为自己太老实太能干了，所以今后应当小心一点，更滑一点。
    我工作上的前紧后松，紧是为了换取自己的地位，换到了，或者尝到苦头了，又想何必呢？少干一点拉拉胡琴消遣一些到也怪有兴趣。我老觉着积极和落后都不好，只有做中间状态的人才合适。我有革命利益均占的想法，我曾经偷支公家一万元，给我家庭做买卖，那时就这样想，我革命多少年啦，我的家庭没用公家分文，没吃公家一顿饭，用公家这点钱还算什么？我这些年来东奔西跑，就值这一万元吗，我当一个雇工那一年也得给几万元的生活费，看：别人的革命，公家有的养他全家，比我可得的利益多啦，就这一点我有什么不应该呢？多年的工作，该有我适当的地位，别人的地位上升，惟我薄待。几年来的革命，我也是拼命流血的干着，我也并非在家当老百姓。光强调自己的功劳，而不回想自己的工作及在群众中的威信。单纯的向上级要求地位，认为自己地位不高，所以对工作也不负责任。不在其位不谋其政，应管的事不管，也不积极提意见，旁观看笑话，犯自由主义，说自己是万金油干部，散布一些不负责任的话。工作消极颓废。使一些消极的同志更消极，把一些积极的也拉了腿。我还不相信上级，抱怨上级，说上级没地位观念，是他有地位啦，他没个人利益，是他个人利益满足啦，所以才叫下级老实着干，这干是为他个人干，以此来维系他的地位。有一次张局长曾经这样讲：“咱们回想几年前，咱们都是小孩子，现在咱长大了是谁把咱养大了，还不是吃革命饭长大的？”我自已想不用这样说，革命把咱养大了，可是我也给革命出力啦，假使没有俺这个小孩子的力气，革命就会这样大吗。不用说这一些，我是知道的，谁也不欠谁情。而不去想咱们再更团结一步，再努一把力，把工作做的更好，何必计较个人的得失。这样想来，那上级完全是对的了。可是当时偏不能这样想。
    正是因为我破落地主的颓废思想没去掉，所以始终没有老老实实的干过工作，经常的是患得患失考虑自己的问题，有时想出书店，又觉其他工作生活太苦，书店工作容易进大城市，等待后来的享受还不错。所以心里想敷衍着工作吧。故意的向上级发牢骚，要地位，愿享受一些舒适的生活。这算是我一个初步的反省吧。（转载冀鲁豫职工生活）    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    冯隐痕同志这段反省，是自己给自己照了一张像，这张像把自己的真面目照出来了，正如他自己说的，患得患失，只替个人打算，对革命，对工作总是消极的。这里缺乏的是还没有很好认识一下自己出身的地主阶级给了自己一些什么影响？自己对这个阶级是不是还有一些留恋？叛变他全心为人民服务呢？还是依恋他继续在革命队伍均一个“股份”呢？如果决心叛变的话，那么自己对人民的态度过去如何？今后应该如何？就可以找到一条道路。冯同志没有能把自己反省出的脏东西加以有力的批判，就是因为这个界限没划清楚。我们希望继续反省，并把反省的情况继续写来。　　——编者
