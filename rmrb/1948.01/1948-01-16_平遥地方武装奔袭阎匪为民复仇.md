Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 13th: On the 22nd of last month, the local armed forces of Pingyao, Jinzhong, annihilated more than 100 阎匪 bandits including a company commander and village chiefs, avenging the murdered masses. Since October of last year, the 阎锡山 bandit gang has been promoting the so-called "Self-Confession and Rebirth Movement," attempting to suppress the people who resist the 阎匪 bandits with inhuman massacres. Villages in the 阎 occupied areas were forced to hold "Self-Confession and Rebirth Conferences." After the villagers were forced to step onto the stage at the conference to "confess" that they had served the democratic government and the People's Liberation Army, the 阎匪 bandits would beat them severely or kill them. On the evening of the 2nd of last month, 尹遵党, the 阎匪 county magistrate of Pingyao, directed the lackeys of the various district and township offices to move out together, arresting more than 700 men, women, and children implicated by "self-confessions," concentrating them in Liujiazhuang north of the city. After a brief "interrogation," more than 420 of them were sent to various townships and killed simultaneously in various places on the 5th. The masses in each village were extremely saddened and indignant about this. In order to avenge the victims, our People's Liberation Army, on the evening of the 22nd of last month, the local armed forces marched more than 100 miles, raiding the 阎匪 stronghold of Nanbeiguandi on the Pingyao-Linfen road, which was carrying out the "Self-Confession and Rebirth Movement." After four hours of fighting, they completely annihilated the defending enemy, killing and wounding 46 阎匪 bandits including a company commander and township chiefs, and capturing 60 bandits alive, including a instructor, and seizing a batch of military supplies. On the way back, they annihilated a squad of bandit troops who were delivering messages. The masses were extremely excited when they heard about it.

　　平遥地方武装奔袭阎匪为民复仇
    【新华社晋绥十三日电】上月廿二日，晋中平遥地方武装歼灭阎匪连长乡长以下百余名，为被害群众复仇。去年十月份起，阎锡山匪帮推行所谓“自白转生运动”，图以绝无人性的屠杀镇压反抗阎匪的人民。阎占区各村均被迫举行“自白转生大会”。阎匪于村民被迫在会上登台“自白供认”曾为民主政府及解放军服务之后，即加毒打或杀害。上月二日晚，阎匪平遥县长尹遵党指挥各区乡公所爪牙一齐出动，逮捕因“自白”株连之男女老小七百余人，集中城北刘家庄，略经“审讯”后，即将其中四百二十余人分发各乡，五日在各地同时杀害，各村群众对此悲愤异常。我解放军为代被害者申冤复仇，上月二十二号晚，当地地方武装急行军百余里，奔袭平（遥）临（汾）路上执行“自白转生运动”之阎匪据点南北官地，战斗四小时全歼守敌，计毙伤匪连长、乡长以下四十六名，生俘匪指导员以下六十名，缴获军火一部，并于归途中歼灭送信匪军一个班。群众听知后，兴奋异常。
