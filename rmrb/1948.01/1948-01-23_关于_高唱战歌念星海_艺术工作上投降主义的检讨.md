Regarding "Singing War Songs and Remembering Xinghai"
    --A Critique of Capitulationism in Artistic Work
  　A Self-Critique from the Editors of the Fourth Page of This Newspaper
    On November 2nd, our newspaper's fourth page published an article by Comrade Ziguang entitled "Singing War Songs and Remembering Xinghai." The viewpoints, stances, feelings, and thoughts expressed in it were problematic. Publishing such an article in a Party newspaper with such prominence was a serious mistake in our work, a mistake of losing our stance. This article was published after we had deleted and revised it, and in some places, reorganized the wording. However, the places that we revised and reorganized were still problematic. For example, the passage "As the autumn breeze cools and the red leaves gradually fall..." and the passage "…our singing has become沉消了" are both stale and decadent sentiments of the feudal literati class and the petty bourgeoisie. This not only shows that we lost our stance in publishing this article but also shows that the editors themselves have very serious problems in their thoughts and stances. Regarding the section about Comrade Xinghai working as a conductor for the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra, comparing it with the text that we deleted, it turns out that it wasn't the case. Although the original manuscript stated, "He once conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra," and later wrote, "Unfortunately, good things are often hampered, and complications arose, and this work ultimately failed." This is certainly a significant manifestation of Comrade Ziguang's erroneous stance. At the same time, the fact that we editors didn't clarify this before deleting and publishing it further demonstrates our irresponsible work style. Under the slogan of opposing "客里空", we still did not raise our vigilance and give it enough importance.
    In addition to asking Comrade Ziguang to conduct a self-critique of this article, we hereby make the above preliminary self-critique. We are willing to accept more criticism for areas where we are still unaware.
    Comrade Ziguang's Self-Critique
    (Omitted preceding text)
    My motives for writing "Singing War Songs and Remembering Xinghai" were impure. Recalling my state of mind at the time, there were at least three thoughts. The first was to be in the limelight. Because Comrade Xinghai's posthumous works were brought back from the Soviet Union, and the Central Propaganda Department entrusted them to us for safekeeping, few people outside knew about these materials. I thought that if I wrote about them first, it would be exceptionally valuable, and I could also become a prominent figure in the domestic music scene. The second idea was to use the opportunity of commemorating Xinghai to express some feelings, stimulate the composers a bit, and promote the organization of colleagues in the music field as soon as possible to launch a creative upsurge and develop a new music movement. The third idea was to continue the past idea of writing a commemorative article for Xinghai every year, which would not only show respect and love for Comrade Xinghai but also take the opportunity to express my artistic views. Due to the above three ideas, I finally managed to write that article hastily in my spare time. Today, in retrospect, this is entirely personal heroism at work, without considering the needs of reality at all, and of course, it is even less about starting from the interests and demands of the people. Needless to say, a work produced under such impure motives must have many problems.
    In that article, a basic viewpoint ran through from beginning to end, that is, formalism. Its essence is to emphasize technique and ignore content. (Is it just "formalism"? Its essence should be clearly recognized as capitulationism. – Editor) I admired Xinghai's skills and cultivation wholeheartedly, but when introducing Xinghai, I only focused on technique, everywhere promoting his greatness and achievements in this area, while giving a light touch to his hardworking spirit of serving the people and the lives and emotions of the working people reflected in his works. At the same time, this technical point of view has further developed into unprincipled comparison. In this comparison, I believe that Xinghai surpassed his pioneer, Nie Er. Indeed, this comparison is meaningless and incorrect. Because the two have their own historical backgrounds and historical conditions, how can Xinghai, who came later, be compared with Nie Er at that time? In fact, Nie Er's contributions to the history of the New Music Movement are brilliant and cannot be erased by anyone. We must not start from a technical point of view and use the new achievements of later generations to belittle or despise Nie Er, the pioneer of new music. What's more, Nie Er's works are still so popular and welcomed by the masses. How many people can catch up with him? This kind of unprincipled comparison is of no benefit to the New Music Movement (Is it just of no benefit to the "New Music Movement"? What about from the perspective of the workers and peasants? – Editor) On the contrary, it gives the opponents of the New Music Movement an opportunity to take advantage of. Strictly speaking, this is a statement that has lost its stance. In addition, my article also said that Xinghai's works have caught up with the international level. Needless to say, this is again from a technical point of view. (This is also a capitulationist view of aligning with the bourgeoisie. From the perspective of the proletariat, workers and peasants' art is also technically superior to the bourgeoisie. "Technology" that is detached from politics and transcends time and space does not exist. – Editor) Because when talking about the international level, I completely ignored Comrade Xinghai's contribution to the cause of the Chinese revolution. In fact, the four words "international level" are themselves a confused concept. This is a statement without a class stance. Obviously, the meaning of the word "international" includes European and American capitalist countries. May I ask, what qualifications does the art of capitalist countries have to compare with us? Our art is progressive, New Democratic, for the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and anti-imperialist and anti-feudal. Even our proletariat's crude creations or budding artworks are much better than those magnificent (Standing on what position to say it is "magnificent"? Is it really magnificent? – Editor) and soulless things in the ivory towers of imperialism or the bourgeoisie. It is a loss of stance to put forward the "international level" in general, and to be proud of Comrade Xinghai's creation catching up with the so-called "international level". In addition, when talking about Comrade Xinghai conducting the Fifth Symphony, I clearly knew that this matter had been brewing for a long time, that he could not go at first, then he was able to go, and finally it still did not succeed (What is this considered "success"? – Editor), but in order to emphasize the technique and promote Xinghai's high cultivation, I did not write frankly, but deliberately showed off my mystification, and talked about the result of this matter in a roundabout way. In the narrative, I only emphasized Xinghai's skills, and then said that foreigners condescended, then said that good things were often hampered, and finally said that it still failed. (What kind of "good thing" is this? This is a great insult to the people's artist! – Editor) This kind of writing is not only vague but also pretentious, as if it were really the case, even making the editor confused, so that a large paragraph of words behind it was deleted. As far as I am concerned, this is not only a technical point of view but also an irresponsible attitude towards readers, and it is also a concrete manifestation of impure Party spirit. At the same time, in the words, there is a sense of pride in "foreigners condescending," and it also says "the Kuomintang is incompetent" and "losing national dignity," etc. Although this is to explain that Xinghai's technology could not be developed in that kind of society, the language is chaotic, the class position is lost, the national position is unstable, and it can even be said to be a manifestation of capitulationism (It should be affirmatively said that it is a manifestation of capitulationism! – Editor), and it can also be said to be a manifestation of bourgeois ideology. In fact, neither the Kuomintang nor foreigners (The collective term for foreigners as "foreigners" is also a statement without class nature; the workers and peasants of capitalist countries are completely consistent with our Chinese proletariat. – Editor) can be compared with our proletariat at all. You must know that any emancipated farmer in our liberated area is much nobler than a foreigner holding the shackles of aggression or a senior Kuomintang bureaucrat holding the yoke of slaves. (Farmers who have not yet been emancipated are also noble. The imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek's party dogs are not noble at all. Saying that farmers are much nobler than them still admits that they are somewhat noble, and there are still remnants of capitulationism. – Editor)
    In addition, when talking about creation, I expressed infinite emotion that the composers did not write good works, or even works like "On the Taihang Mountains!" ("Composers," without the approval of the peasants, why call them "composers?" – Editor) In fact, there is no need to be sentimental. We should find out the reasons and overcome them, and naturally, many songs that the masses love to sing will be produced. Last time I only mentioned the phenomenon and did not analyze it. Today I will add a little bit. I think the reason why the composition world has not produced good works is mainly three: First, there is a lack of love for the people (referring to workers, peasants, and soldiers), and there is no wholehearted service to the people, and the spirit of "willing to be an ox for the children"; second, there is not enough understanding of the lives and emotions of the people (especially the poor and hired); third, the technical point of view (In fact, it is capitulationism. – Editor) Many music workers are studying the technology and theory of Western music, creating choruses, ensembles, and even symphonies, while despising mass songs, thinking they are simple and not interested. Due to the above three reasons, mass songs are naturally stillborn. To produce a large number of mass songs in the future, we must first overcome the above three shortcomings. Our music workers should put down their burdens and go to the masses, and with the spirit of "willing to be an ox for the children," contact the masses in practical work, understand the masses, and reflect the struggles, lives, and emotions of the masses with the melodies, rhythms, and musical styles that the masses love most. (This is still to "contact" the masses in order to compose, and it is still not wholehearted work for the people. The result will still be a failure to understand the masses. – Editor) But don't stick to the old ways and copy the old ways, or imitate Western technology and forms. More importantly, we must boldly create musical works with national style and national sentiment that the masses love to hear and see, and that are fresh and lively.
    Finally, our music circles should unite and organize to become a strong artistic front. At the same time, we must eliminate the influence of bourgeois artistic thought and the artistic tastes and emotions of the literati class from ourselves (We must first eliminate the thoughts of the feudal literati and the bourgeoisie before we can form a battle line. Moreover, this front should first be combined with the broad masses of the working people. When not wholeheartedly working for the people, the unity of the "music circle" can only form a small sect that confronts the peasants. As long as they are all wholeheartedly working for the people, they will naturally unite. – Editor), inherit the path of Nie Er and Xinghai, and establish national, mass, and scientific new music! This land reform study has given me many valuable class educations. I deeply feel that I am not worthy to be called a proletarian art worker. In the future, I will only strengthen class education, stand on the class position, work for the people, be a servant of the people, be loyal and honest, and serve the people wholeheartedly. I am willing to encourage myself with this, and at the same time, I hope that my comrades in the literary and art circles will encourage each other! This superficial self-critique is only the beginning of my self-critique in the field of creation. There are bound to be omissions and errors, and I hope that my comrades will give me more advice. I am extremely grateful!

    (Editor's note: Comrade Ziguang has initially realized his mistakes after this study and is determined to work for the people, which is good. However, he still does not have enough understanding of the capitulationism in artistic thought, and his basic point of view is still far from the proletarian position. It is hoped that after reading this, everyone will continue to discuss this issue.)

　　关于“高唱战歌念星海”
    ——艺术工作上投降主义的检讨
  　本报第四版编辑同志的检讨
    十一月二日，本报四版发表了紫光同志作“高唱战歌念星海”一篇文章。其中所表现的观点、立场，及感情、思想都是有问题的。这样一篇文章在党报上用显著的地位登出来，这是我们在工作上犯了一个严重的错误，是一个丧失立场的错误。这篇文章，是经过我们删改，有些地方在文字上经过重新的组织，最后把它发表出来的。而经过我们删改过，在文字上重新组织过的地方，都仍然是有问题的。如“当此秋风已凉，红叶渐落之时………”一段，及“………我们的歌声却消沉了”一段，都是陈腐不堪的封建士大夫阶级的和小资产阶级的感情。这样，不仅说明我们发表这篇文章，在工作上丧失了立场，而且说明我们编辑工作者本身的思想和立场，亦同时存在着十分严重的问题。关于星海同志在上海工部局管弦乐队担任指挥工作那一段，和被我们所删去的文字对照一下，原来并没有那么回事。虽然在原稿上，前面写着：“他曾经在上海工部局管弦乐队指挥过悲多汶的第五交响乐”，后面又写着：“可惜好事多磨，节外生枝，这件工作最后仍然流了产”，这固然是紫光同志立场错误的显著表现，同时，我们编辑同志并没有弄清楚就把它删掉发表，这更说明我们不负责任的工作作风，在反对客里空的口号下面，依然没有提起自己的警惕与足够的重视。
    除请紫光同志对这篇文章作自我检讨外，我们谨作以上初步的检讨。还有认识不到的地方，愿接受大家更多的批评。
    紫光同志的自我检讨
    （前略）
    我写“高唱战歌念星海”一文的动机，是不纯的。回忆一下当时的心情，至少有下面三种想法。第一种想法，是抢先出风头。因为星海同志的遗作，从苏联带回后，中宣部交给我们慎重保管，这些材料外界知者甚少，我想如果抢先写出，势必珍贵异常，自己在国内乐坛，也可出一风头。第二种想法，是借纪念星海的机会，发发感慨，刺激作曲家们一下，并推动音乐界同人，赶快组织起来，掀起一个创作热潮，开展新的音乐运动。第三种想法，是继续过去的想法，每年为星海写一篇纪念文章，既能表示对星海同志的敬仰与爱戴，又能借题发挥自己的艺术见解。由于以上三种想法，我终于忙里抽闲，仓促草率地写了那篇文章。今天检讨起来，这完全是个人英雄主义在作崇，根本没有考虑到现实的需要，当然更谈不上是从人民大众的利益与要求出发了。在这种不纯的动机下所产生的作品，不消说一定会有许多问题的。
    在那篇文章里，由头到尾贯穿了一个基本观点，那就是形式主义。它的本质，就是强调技巧，忽视内容。（岂止是“形式主义”？应明确认识它的本质就是投降主义。——编者）对于星海的技巧与修养，我是佩服得五体投地，但在介绍星海时，我就只着重技术，处处都在宣扬他在这方面的伟大与成就，而对他那为人民大众服务的刻苦精神，及他在作品里反映的劳动人民的生活与情感，却轻描淡写不大重视。同时，这种技术观点，更发展成为无原则的比较。在这次比较中，我认为星海超过了他的先驱者聂耳。诚然，这种比较是毫无实际意义的，而且也是不正确的。因为两人各有各的时代背景，各有各的历史条件，怎么能拿后来的星海与当时的聂耳来比较呢？其实聂耳在新音乐运动史上的功绩，是光辉灿烂的，是任何人所不能抹煞的，决不能从技术观点出发，用后来者新的功绩，将新音乐的开路先锋——聂耳，贬低或轻视。更何况聂耳的作品，一直到现在还是那样普遍地流行，受到广大群众的欢迎，试问有几位能赶上他呢？这种无原则的比较，对新音乐运动，一点好处也没有（只是对“新音乐运动”没好处吗？从工农立场上看又如何？——编者）相反，倒给新音乐运动的反对者以可乘之机。严格检讨起来，这是失掉立场的言论。此外，我的文章中又说，星海的作品，已经赶上了国际水平。不消说，这又是从技术观点出发。（这也是向资产阶级看齐的投降主义的观点。从无产阶级的观点出发，工农艺术在技术上也是比资产阶级优越的，脱离政治超越时间空间的“技术”是不存在的。——编者）因为在谈到国际水平时，我把星海同志对中国革命事业的贡献，根本忽略未谈。其实，“国际水平”这四个字，本身就是个糊涂观念。这是没有阶级立场的说法。显然，“国际”这两个字的含义，包括了欧美资本主义国家在内。试问资本主义国家的艺术，有什么资格和我们相比啊？我们的艺术是进步的，新民主主义的，为工农兵大众的，反帝反封建的艺术。即使我们无产阶级粗糙的创造，或萌芽状态的艺术品，比起帝国主义或资产阶级象牙塔里的那些富丽堂皇（站在什么立场上说它“富丽堂皇”？真是富丽堂皇的吗？——编者）而没有灵魂的东西来，也要高明得多。笼统地提出“国际水平”来，而且以星海同志的创作赶上所谓“国际水平”为荣，这也是失掉立场的表现。此外在谈到星海同志指挥第五交响乐一事时，我明明知道此事酝酿了许久，最初不能去，后来又能够去，最后仍然没有成功（这算什么“成功”？——编者），但为了强调技术，宣扬星海的修养高明，我没有秉笔直言，却故意卖弄玄虚，转湾磨角地说出此事的结果。在叙述中，我光强调星海的技巧，继说洋人屈就，后说好事多磨，最后说仍然流产。（这算什么“好事”？这是对人民艺术家莫大的侮辱！——编者）这种文笔不但语句含混，而且装腔作势，仿佛真有其事似地，甚至使编辑同志都迷糊不清，以致把后面一大段话都删去了。在我讲来，这不但是技术观点，而且是对读者不负责任的态度，也是党性不纯的具体表现。同时，在言语之间，颇有以“洋人屈就”为荣之感，并且还说出“国民党无能”，“失去国格”等话，虽然这是为了说明星海的技术，在那样的社会中不能得到发展，但言语混乱，阶级立场丧失，民族立场不稳，甚至可说是投降主义的表现，（应肯定的说，就是投降主义的表现！——编者）也可以说是资产阶级思想的流露。其实无论是国民党，或者洋人，（笼统称外国人为“洋人”，也是没有阶级性的说法；资本主义国家的工农无产阶级和我们中国的无产阶级是完全一致的。——编者）就根本不能和我们无产阶级相提并论。要知道，我们解放区的任何翻身农民，比起手持侵略镣铐的洋人，或端着奴隶枷锁的国民党高级官僚，要高尚得多。（还没有翻身的农民也是高尚的。而帝国主义与蒋党狗官们则一点也不高尚。说农民比它们高尚得多、这仍是承认它有些高尚，仍是有投降主义残余的。——编者）
    此外，在谈到创作的时候，我对作曲家们没有写出好作品，甚至连“太行山上”那样的作品都没有，表示了无限感慨！（“作曲家”在未经农民批准以前，凭什么称他们是“作曲家”？——编者）其实，用不着感慨，应当找出原因来，克服了那个原因，自然就可以产生出许多大众喜唱乐闻的歌声了。上次我只提了一下现象，没有分析论述。今天我略微补充一下。我以为作曲界所以没有产生好作品出来，其原因主要有三：一是缺乏对人民（指工农兵）的热爱，没有全心全意为人民服务，及“俯首甘为孺子牛”的精神；二是对人民（尤其对贫雇）的生活情感不够了解；三是技术观点，（其实是投降主义。——编者）许多音乐工作者在钻研西洋音乐的技术与理论，创作合唱曲合奏曲甚至交响曲，对群众歌曲轻视，认为简单，不发生兴趣。由于上面这三个原因，群众歌曲自然难产了。今后要产生大量的群众歌曲，首先要克服上面三个缺点。我们音乐工作者，应放下包袱，到群众中去，以“俯首甘为孺子牛”的精神，在实际工作中接触群众，了解群众，以群众所最喜爱的旋律节奏与乐式，来反映群众的斗争生活与情感。（这仍是为了作曲才去“接触”群众，仍不是全心全意为人民做长工，其结果也将仍然是了解不了群众。——编者）但千万不要墨守成规抄袭故道，或模仿西洋的技术与形式，更重要的，是我们要大胆创造群众所喜闻乐见的，新鲜活泼的，民族风格与民族情调的音乐作品。
    最后，我们音乐界应当团结起来，组织起来，成为一条坚强的艺术战线，同时我们要从自己的身上肃清资产阶级艺术思想的影响，以及士大夫阶级的艺术趣味与情感，（必须先肃清封建士大夫与资产阶级的思想，然后才可能结成战线。而且这条战线首先应是和广大劳动人民相结合。在不是全心全意为人民当长工的时候，“音乐界”的团结只可能形成对抗农民的小宗派。只要都是全心全意为人民当长工的，就自然会团结一致。——编者）继承聂耳星海的道路，建立民族的大众的科学的新音乐！这次土改学习，给我许多宝贵的阶级教育，我深深感到自己不配称做无产阶级的艺术工作者，今后惟有加强阶级教育，站在阶级立场，为人民做长工，做人民的勤务员，忠诚老实，全心全意地为人民服务。我愿以此自勉，同时希望文艺界战友们，以此共勉！这次粗浅的检讨，只是我在创作方面检讨的开始，疏漏谬误之处，在所难免，还望同志们多多赐教，不胜感盼之至！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    （编者按：紫光同志经过这次学习，初步认识到了自己的错误，决心为人民做长工，这是好的。但对于艺术思想上的投降主义认识得仍不够，基本观点仍和无产阶级立场有很大距离。希望大家读了以后继续展开对这问题的讨论。）
