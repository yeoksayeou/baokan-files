Opinions on the "Labor-Capital Cooperation" in Mapingtou Village

　　This winter, many places in our border region have been enthusiastically engaged in winter production, making quite a stir. The leadership has said that we must rely on the poor and hired peasants and let them be masters of their own affairs. However, after inspection, many poor and hired peasants have not yet turned over, lacking food, drink, clothing, and bedding, making it impossible to produce. Therefore, some places have come up with a method, saying that they want to promote mutual aid and borrowing among middle and poor peasants, which means planning to tap into the resources of middle peasants to help poor and hired peasants "become prosperous." We believe this approach is very inappropriate.

　　Originally, middle and poor peasants were a united force to overthrow landlords and equally distribute land, they were like one family. It is acceptable for middle peasants to willingly lend money or goods to help poor peasants who have just turned over and lack resources to start production. However, the current reality is clearly not the case. In many places, land reform is not thorough, landlords have not been thoroughly struggled against, cadres have taken the rich peasant route, and the distribution of fruits is unfair, which has not satisfied the demands of landless and land-poor peasants. Judging from the material published today about Mapingtou Village in Jincheng, it is safe to say that the poor and hired peasants there have not turned over. Instead of seeking the reasons why the poor and hired peasants have not turned over, and examining whether the landlords have not been thoroughly struggled against or whether the distribution of fruits is unfair, the leadership is instead trying to "break through the middle peasant ideology" and harm the interests of the middle peasants, letting the middle peasants fill the holes of the poor and hired peasants. This approach is not in line with the fundamental spirit of the Party's May 4th Directive, nor is it in line with the spirit of the Land Law. As Comrade Mao Zedong said well in "The Present Situation and Our Tasks": "During land reform, the middle peasants expressed their approval of equal distribution, because equal distribution does not harm the middle peasants. During equal distribution, a portion of the middle peasant's land remains unchanged, a portion increases, and only a small number of well-off middle peasants have a small amount of surplus land, which they are also willing to take out for equal distribution, because after equal distribution, their land tax burden will be reduced." The practice in Mapingtou Village is not in line with the spirit of Chairman Mao. Doing so will inevitably disrupt the peasant ranks, disperse strength, and break up the unity of middle and poor peasants.

　　But what we must pay the most attention to is why this phenomenon is happening today? This is mainly because some selfish cadres are unwilling to give up the fruits they have gained too much, or they are protecting the landlords and are unwilling to struggle against them again. Some also want to use the method of harming the middle peasants to redeem their own sins towards the poor and hired peasants, and as a result, the interests of all peasants are harmed. Leaders must be very clear-headed about this situation and should thoroughly investigate it, and not let it continue to develop. By no means should we allow landlords, rich peasants, and village cadres from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds to take advantage of the loopholes. Now that the Party's Land Law Outline has been published, we must act in accordance with the regulations. We must return the fruits that were gained too much, and the landlords who have not been thoroughly struggled against must be thoroughly struggled against. We firmly believe that only by doing so can we truly satisfy the demands of the vast number of hired and poor peasants in Mapingtou Village.

### 对马坪头村“劳资合作”的意见

　　对马坪头村“劳资合作”的意见
    今年冬天，咱们边区好多地方都在热烘烘的搞冬季生产，热闹了一大阵。领导上说的是要依靠贫雇，让贫雇当家，但经过检查，很多贫雇还没翻身，少吃没喝、少穿没盖，没法生产。于是有的地方便想了一个办法，说是要让中贫农互助互借，也就是要从中农身上打算盘来帮助贫雇“生产发家”，这种办法我们认为很不妥当。
    本来中贫农是一个共同打倒地主、平分土地的队伍，是一家人，中贫农之间两相情愿，中农借出钱、借出东西来帮助刚翻身没抵垫的贫农生产是可以的；现在的实际情况显然不是这样，有很多地方土地改革不彻底，地主没斗透，干部走了富农路线，果实分配不公，因而也就没有满足了无地少地农民的要求。就从今天发表的晋城马坪头村的材料看，那里贫雇可以肯定说没有翻身，领导上不去寻找贫雇没有翻身的原因，看看是不是地主没有斗透？是不是果实分配不公道？而是去“突破中农思想”，损害中农利益，让中农去补贫雇窟窿。这种做法既不合于党的五四指示的根本精神，更不合于土地法的精神；毛泽东同志在“目前形势和我们的任务”一文中说的好：“土地改革中，中农表现赞成平分，这是因为平分并不损害中农。在平分时，中农一部分土地不变动，一部分增加了土地，只有一部分富裕中农有少数多余的土地，他们也愿意拿出来平分，这是因为在平分后土地税的负担他们出减轻了”。马坪头村的作法是不合于毛主席精神的，这样做的结果一定把农民阵营打乱，力量分散，拆散中贫农的团结。
    但是最值得我们注意的乃是为什么在今天发生这种现象？这主要是有一部分自私自利的干部，不愿退出多得果实，或者是对地主有包庇不愿再斗，也有的想拿损害中农的办法，来向贫雇赎自己的罪，结果，是损害了全体农民的利益。领导者对这种情形，必须十分清醒，应该彻底调查，不能让它再继续发展，千万不能让地主富农及地富出身的村干部在一旁钻空子。现在党的土地法大纲已经公布了，一定要按照规定的办事。多得果实必须退出，地主未斗透必须斗透，我们坚决相信，只有这样做，才能真正满足了马坪头村广大雇贫的要求。
