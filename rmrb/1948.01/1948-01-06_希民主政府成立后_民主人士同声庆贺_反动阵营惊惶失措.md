　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st】Comprehensive report: The establishment of the Greek Provisional People's Democratic Government has won unanimous congratulations from democrats around the world, and has left the entire imperialist reactionary camp in utter dismay. The Greek people rejoiced upon hearing the news of the new government's establishment. According to a broadcast by the Democratic Army Radio Station, the people in the Greek liberated areas unanimously stated: "The new government's program embodies the hopes and will of the people. This is an unprecedented event in Greek history and an effective and solid foundation for achieving unity and peace among the people. From now on, the final victory of the Greek People's Liberation War is even more assured." Soviet Pravda observer Leontiev commented on this, saying: "The establishment of this government marks the unprecedented growth of Greek democratic forces. The infinitely deep enthusiasm of the Greek people for freedom and independence is embodied in the growth and consolidation of Greek democratic forces. The armed intervention of American and British imperialism and the barbaric atrocities of the Greek royalist fascists have failed to destroy the Greek people's will to fight for national independence, thus causing chaos in the entire reactionary camp from Athens to Washington and putting the American and British protectors of the Greek fascists in a difficult position." Labor Daily stated: "The lofty goal of the Markos government is the aspiration and hope of all Greek patriots." A broadcaster from Radio Belgrade in Yugoslavia stated: "This is the most important event in the lives of the Greek people." This proves that "nothing can destroy the Greek democratic people's firm resistance and their struggle for independence and democracy." The Bulgarian Committee to Aid Democratic Greece sent a telegram to Markos stating: "The Bulgarian people are following with great concern and sympathy the heroic struggle of the Greek people for freedom and independence against the enslavement of the Greek people by American and British aggressors and their royalist fascist lackeys. The Bulgarian people are extremely pleased with the establishment of the People's Democratic Government. The Bulgarian people are prepared to join all democratic people in providing full assistance to the Greek people. We are confident that the day is not far off when the Greek people will overthrow the royalist fascist dictatorship." The committee also convened a mass meeting in Sofia on the 28th. Speakers at the meeting, in addition to denouncing the shameless attempts of American and British warmongers, insisted: "The establishment of the Markos government will contribute to peace in the Balkans" (Agence France-Presse).
    On the other hand, the bandit puppet authorities in Athens, after the establishment of the Markos government, were distraught and urgently "sought decisions from the American and British ambassadors." The U.S. State Department and Truman, as well as the American and British imperialist authorities, also held meetings to discuss the Greek issue.

　　希民主政府成立后
  　民主人士同声庆贺
    反动阵营惊惶失措
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】综合报导：希腊临时人民民主政府之成立，博得世界民主人士之同声庆贺，而使整个帝国主义反动阵营惊惶莫名。希腊人民听到新政府成立的消息后，欢欣雀跃。据民主军广播电台报导，希解放区人民一致声称：“新政府的纲领体现了人民的希望与意志，这是希腊历史上的创举，也是取得人民的统一与和平的有效而坚实的基础。从此希腊人民解放战争的最后胜利，已更有把握了。”苏联真理报观察家李昂捷也夫对此评称：“这一政府的成立，标志着希腊民主力量的空前壮大。希腊人民争取自由与独立的无限深厚的热情，在希腊民主力量的增长与巩固中体现出来了。美英帝国主义的武装干涉与希腊保皇党法西斯的野蛮暴行，均未能摧毁希腊人民争取民族独立的斗争意志，因而引起了从雅典到华盛顿整个反动阵营中的混乱。并使希腊法西斯的美英保护者处于困境”。劳动报称：“马科斯政府之崇高目的乃是希腊一切爱国者的志愿与希望。”南斯拉夫贝尔格莱德电台广播员称：“这是希腊人民生活中最重要的事件”。这证明了“没有任何东西可以摧毁希腊民主人民坚强之反抗以及他们争取独立与民主的斗争”。保加利亚援助民主希腊人民委员会致电马科斯称：“保国人民皆以极大关心与同情，注视希腊人民争取自由独立、反对美英侵略者及其保皇党法西斯从仆奴役希腊人民的英勇斗争。保国人民对人民民主政府的成立极表高兴。保国人民已准备与一切民主人民一起，予希腊人民以全力援助。我们确信希腊人民推翻保皇党法西斯独裁专政的日期已不远了”。该委员会并于二十八日在保京召开群众大会，会上发言者除痛斥美英战争贩子之无耻企图外，坚称：“马科斯政府之成立，将对巴尔干和平有所贡献”（法新社）。
    另一方面，雅典匪伪当局，则在马科斯政府成立后，失魂落魄，急向“美英大使寻求决策”，美国务院与杜鲁门之间，美英帝国主义当局之间，亦纷纷召开会议，商讨希腊问题。
