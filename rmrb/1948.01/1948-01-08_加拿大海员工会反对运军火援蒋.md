Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: According to a Canadian dispatch on the 28th, the President of the Canadian Seamen's Union, Harry Davis, sent a telegram to Canadian Prime Minister King, opposing the Canadian government's criminal act of providing military aid to Chiang Kai-shek. The telegram firmly demanded "the prohibition of transporting arms to Chiang Kai-shek," pointing out that "continuing to transport arms to the fascist Chiang Kai-shek is a betrayal of the twenty million people who died in the anti-fascist struggle (referring to the people of various countries who died in World War II)." It is reported that the second batch of armaments shipped by the Canadian government to Chiang Kai-shek to slaughter the Chinese people has already been shipped from Canada to China under the strong suppression of the Canadian government.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: According to TASS, New York: The Methodist Church's Federation for Social Action held its annual meeting in Kansas City, Missouri at the end of last month to discuss proposals for opposing the current reactionary U.S. foreign policy and strengthening U.S.-Soviet friendship. Seventy-five delegates attended the meeting, representing the opinions of 11 million members of the Methodist Church. During the three-day discussion, the association passed a series of resolutions opposing the U.S.'s reactionary foreign policy, urging the United States to end the Truman Doctrine in Greece. The delegates also strongly condemned the United States' aggressive policy in China and resolved to demand that the U.S. government withdraw its military advisory group stationed in China (Chiang bandit regime) and cease all military missions and military assistance to China (Chiang bandit). Other resolutions passed by the association included urging the withdrawal of all troops from Korea, the destruction of atomic bombs, and the recall of Truman's representative to the Vatican, Taylor. Regarding U.S.-Soviet relations, the association resolved to urge the U.S. government to resolve relations between the two countries with understanding and goodwill, and to seek cooperation through the United Nations.

　　加拿大海员工会反对运军火援蒋
    【新华社陕北四日电】据加拿大二十八日消息：加拿大海员工会主席哈利·戴维斯致电加总理金氏，反对加政府以军火援蒋的罪恶行为。该电坚决要求“禁止运送军器给蒋介石”，指出“继续运军器给法西斯的蒋介石，就是背叛死于反法西斯斗争中的二千万人民（指第二次世界大战中死亡的各国人民）”。按加政府运给蒋介石屠杀中国人民的第二批军火武器，已在加政府强力压制下由加启运来华。
