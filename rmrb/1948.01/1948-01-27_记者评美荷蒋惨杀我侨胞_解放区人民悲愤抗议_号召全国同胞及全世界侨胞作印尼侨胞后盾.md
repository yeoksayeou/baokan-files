Xinhua News Agency Reporter Comments on the Tragedy of Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies;
Liberated Area People Protest in Grief and Indignation;
Calling on Compatriots Nationwide and Overseas to Support Indonesian Overseas Chinese

(Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th) A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the plight of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, stating:

Recently, nine hundred overseas Chinese in Indonesia were collectively massacred by Dutch imperialists, and thousands more are detained in prisons, their fate unknown.

This bloodbath is a bloody record jointly orchestrated by American and Dutch imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government. The reason why Dutch aggressors dare to commit such heinous crimes is precisely because the US imperialists and Chiang bandits encourage and support their war of aggression against Indonesia.

As everyone knows, the Chiang bandits pursue a traitorous foreign policy, repeatedly publicly slandering and antagonizing the Indonesian people's struggle for independence and liberation. To take a recent example: In November of last year, the Chiang bandits colluded with US, Dutch, and other imperialists to prevent Indonesia from participating in the Far East and Asia Economic Conference. In mid-December, the Chiang bandit consulate general in Batavia instigated the Batavia General Chamber of Commerce to participate in the West Java separatist movement conference hosted by Van Mook. With the full support of the Chiang bandits, Dutch imperialism has more frantically launched a joint Dutch-Chiang offensive aimed at persecuting all overseas Chinese. At the same time, it must be pointed out that the Dutch imperialist massacre of overseas Chinese is not the first time. As far back as 1940, the "Red River Massacre" saw the collective killing of 10,000 Chinese coolies. For two hundred years, Dutch imperialism has continuously provoked ethnic hatred between Chinese and Indonesian peoples. Around the time of the Indonesian Revolution of 1926-27, thousands of overseas Chinese youths were arrested, deported, exiled, and massacred by the Dutch. Dutch imperialism is the cruel executioner and mortal enemy of overseas Chinese in Indonesia.

The people of the liberated areas express unanimous anger at this bloody debt of the US, Dutch, and Chiang massacre of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies! We express our deep condolences to the martyred compatriots. We lodge a serious protest with the US and Dutch imperialists, and call on compatriots across the country and overseas Chinese around the world to unite and support the Indonesian overseas Chinese. First, we must fight for the immediate restoration of freedom for the arrested overseas Chinese. At the same time, we hope that Indonesian overseas Chinese, in order to protect their own survival and rights, will unite with the Indonesian people to expel the forces of US and Dutch imperialism, and at the same time unite with the people in the motherland who are engaged in revolutionary war to overthrow the criminal rule of the Chiang bandits.

　　新华社记者评美荷蒋惨杀我侨胞
  　解放区人民悲愤抗议
  　号召全国同胞及全世界侨胞作印尼侨胞后盾
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】新华社记者评荷印侨胞被难事称：
    印尼侨胞九百人，最近被荷兰帝国主义集体屠杀，尚有数千侨胞被拘禁在监狱里，至今生死不明。
    这次血案是美、荷帝国主义和蒋匪政府联合演出的血腥记录。荷兰侵略者之所以胆敢制造此种滔天罪行，正是美帝和蒋匪鼓励支持其对印尼发动侵略战争的结果。
    众所周知，蒋匪奉行卖国媚外的外交政策，一再公开诽谤与仇视印尼人民争取独立解放的斗争。即以最近为例：去年十一月间，蒋匪曾与美、荷等帝国主义勾结，阻止了印尼参加远东及亚洲经济会议。上月中旬，驻巴城蒋匪总领事馆曾唆使巴城总商会参加范。穆克主持下的西爪哇分裂运动会议。荷兰帝国主义在蒋匪全力支持下，就更加疯狂地展开以迫害全体华侨为目标的荷蒋联合攻势。同时必须指出：荷兰帝国主义对华侨的大屠杀已经不是第一次了，远在一九四○年，就有一万名中国苦力被集体杀戮的“红河大惨案”。两百年来，荷兰帝国主义曾不断挑拨中、印民族的民族仇恨。一九二六——二七年印尼大革命前后，被荷兰拘捕、驱逐、流放、惨杀的华侨青年就达千名以上。荷兰帝国主义就是印尼侨胞凶恶的刽子手和死敌。
    解放区人民对这次美、荷、蒋屠杀荷印侨胞的血海深仇，表示一致的愤怒！对蒙难侨胞表示沉痛的哀悼。我们向美、荷帝国主义者提出严重抗议，并号召全国同胞及全世界各地侨胞一致起来作印尼侨胞的后盾，首先为被捕侨胞之立即恢复自由而斗争。同时希望印尼侨胞为了保障自己的生存与权利，与印尼人民团结一致，驱逐美、荷帝国主义势力，同时与祖国从事革命战争的人民团结一致打倒蒋匪的罪恶统治。
