The General Bank's winter loan instructions last December emphasized that "all new loans this winter must be guaranteed to be given to poor and hired peasants." According to our understanding, various regions have created considerable experience in loan work regarding "how to follow the poor and hired peasant line," but some deviations have also occurred. We now raise a few issues for everyone's attention:

(1) How to find poor and hired peasants and get the loans into their hands?

There are two ways to find poor and hired peasants. One is to personally visit the "poorest people" first and then rely on them to connect with other poor and hired peasants. Because "poor people and poor people are kindred spirits," only poor and hired peasants can find other poor and hired peasants. This method is correct. The other is to rely on village cadres to introduce poor and hired peasants, but since most village cadres are middle or rich peasant in composition, most of those they introduce are not genuinely poor and hired peasants. As a result, the cadre line is followed, which should be corrected. Of course, village cadres who are from poor and hired peasant backgrounds and support them can also introduce poor and hired peasants.

In order to prevent non-poor peasant elements from infiltrating, we must adopt the method of "evaluating poverty and comparing poverty" to conduct a self-examination by the poor and hired peasants themselves to ensure the purity of the poor and hired peasant ranks. Then, elect a poor and hired peasant loan committee to divide into groups and rely on the poor and hired peasants themselves to evaluate and distribute the loans based on each person's difficulties and production situation. It is right for us to mobilize the poor and hired peasants and support them, but we must oppose the phenomenon of county, district, and village cadres taking over and doing everything for them. We must adhere to the principle of "the masses liberating themselves." Only when the poor and hired peasants themselves control the power of evaluation and distribution can the loans be completely given to the poor and hired peasants.

In the process of mobilizing the poor and hired peasants, it is necessary to repeatedly and patiently explain the poor and hired peasant loan policy to them so that they fully understand it and to inspire their awareness of "being the masters of their own affairs." Only in this way can we overcome the phenomenon in some places where poor and hired peasants are afraid of village cadres and dare not boldly take charge. For example, in Gaojiazhuang, She County, when poor and hired peasants evaluated loans, they first left a share for the village cadres. This phenomenon must be corrected.

In loan work, our attitude towards village cadres should be handled correctly. Some of them are good and willing to implement the loan policy and are genuinely supported by the poor and hired peasants. Other bad cadres, because they do not benefit from issuing loans to poor and hired peasants and are even required to withdraw their loans during re-lending, secretly sabotage and obstruct the loan work. In order to reduce obstacles to loan work, it is necessary to convene village cadre meetings to convey the loan policy and practices, but it is necessary to strictly criticize the past practice of village cadres occupying too many loans as wrong. In this way, on the one hand, we can unite and educate good village cadres and strive for their help in the smooth progress of this work (but not mainly rely on them), and on the other hand, isolate bad village cadres and put pressure on them so that they dare not engage in sabotage activities. In short, our attitude towards village cadres is the principle of "uniting the good and isolating the bad."

(2) How to eliminate the ideological concerns of poor and hired peasants regarding loans?

Most poor and hired peasants have not completely turned themselves around and need loans to help them solve production difficulties. However, some poor and hired peasants are afraid to take out loans. Some say, "The public funds are complicated in procedures. You have to repay whenever they want it." Others say, "We can't find a way to produce. What's the use of taking out a loan?" Why do the masses have these concerns? On the one hand, it is due to the shortcomings of our past loans, such as restrictions on use and inconvenient procedures, which must be corrected in this loan. On the other hand, we have not helped the poor and hired peasants to specifically calculate accounts and formulate production plans, nor have we found ways to produce. For example, Wang Fuyin of Qiaocun, Qin County, had been a farmhand for three generations and had not turned himself around. This time, when he was about to be given a loan, he worried for two days and was unwilling to take out the loan. After we interviewed him, we realized that the reason he dared not take out the loan was that he was old and could not find a way to produce. Therefore, we organized him to produce together in a mutual aid group, which dispelled his concerns. This proves that we must not only provide loans to poor and hired peasants, but also help them find ways to produce and formulate production plans.

(3) The issue of uniting with middle peasants

Attention should be paid to two principles when issuing loans: (1) The demands of the poor and hired peasants must be met as much as possible (because the loans are small, they may not be fully satisfied). This is the basic task of the loan. (2) We must resolutely unite with the middle peasants and avoid the phenomenon of opposition between the middle peasants and the poor and hired peasants. How to unite? First, there should be some distinction in the attitude towards middle peasants and landlords and rich peasants when transferring and recovering old loans. Loans to landlords and rich peasants should be resolutely recovered immediately. Loans over-occupied by cooperatives should also be resolutely recovered. Certain truly difficult middle peasants can be taken care of as long as they are evaluated by poor and hired peasants. In Xingtai City, the list of loan households was announced to the masses for discussion, allowing the poor and hired peasants to discuss which households should be recovered immediately and which households could be postponed. This method can be adopted. Second, political education should be conducted among the middle peasants, emphasizing that "middle peasants and poor peasants are one family" and "middle peasants can get loans in the future if they don't get loans for the time being." Organize poor and hired peasants and middle peasants to cooperate and help each other in production. The Taiyue District proposed the practice of "middle peasants contributing idle funds and poor peasants contributing loans to engage in production together," which is generally correct. We must understand that if we are not good at uniting with the middle peasants during the transfer of loans, causing the poor and hired peasants to be isolated in the countryside, it will be detrimental to all work.

(4) Style of work

To implement the poor and hired peasant line, it is first necessary to go deep among the poor and hired peasants and understand them. How can we closely approach the poor and hired peasants and understand their thoughts, emotions, difficulties, and demands? First of all, we must have the spirit of being friends with the poor and hired peasants and being good farmhands for them. We must recognize that the feelings and demands of the poor and hired peasants are completely consistent with the spirit of our policies. They wholeheartedly support all the policies of the Communist Party. As long as we are willing to put down the "official airs," discuss matters with the poor and hired peasants, proactively visit their homes to learn about their concerns, understand their difficulties and how they have turned themselves around, and tell them about various policies, they will tell us their innermost thoughts. In the past, some cadres often stayed in cooperatives or cadres' homes when they went to the countryside, making the poor and hired peasants think that "cadres eat well, but poor people don't." We must resolutely overcome this upper-level line style of only approaching cadres and not approaching the masses.

In addition, in mobilizing the poor and hired peasants, we should also inspire their class consciousness and enthusiasm. Educate them to think from the perspective of class interests and develop a democratic style of discussing matters with everyone after they have become the masters of their own affairs. Prevent a few active poor and hired peasants from spreading some bad habits of "taking care of everything."

The above issues must be clearly resolved ideologically and in work in order to implement the poor and hired peasant line in loan work and do a good job in loan work. (General Bank of Jinnan)

### 怎样贯彻贷款中的贫雇路线

　　怎样贯彻贷款中的贫雇路线
    去年十二月总行冬贷指示，着重指出：“今冬新增贷款必须保证全部贷给贫雇农手中”。现据我们的了解，各地在贷款工作中，对于“如何走贫雇路线”已创造了不少经验，但也发生一些偏向，现在提出几个问题，希望大家注意：
    （一）怎样找到贫雇，把款贷到贫雇手中？
    找贫雇的方法有两种，一种是我们首先亲自去访问“最穷的人”，然后依靠他们去串通贫雇。因为“穷人和穷人同是知心人”，只有贫雇才能找到贫雇，这一种方法是正确的。另一种是依靠村干部介绍贫雇，但由于村干部大部分是中、富农成份，所以他介绍的大部分不是真正贫雇，因之走了干部路线，应当纠正。当然是贫雇出身为贫雇拥护的村干部，我们也可以经过他们介绍贫雇的。
    为了防止非贫雇分子混入，我们必须采取“评穷比穷”的办法，进行贫雇自己的审查，做到贫雇阵营的纯洁，然后选举贫雇贷款委员会划分小组，根据每个人的困难和生产情形，依靠贫雇自己去评议和分配贷款。我们为了发动贫雇，给贫雇撑腰是对的，但要反对县区村干部的包办代替现象，我们必须遵守“群众自己解放自己”的原则，只有贫雇自己掌握了评议和分配的大权，才能把款完全贷到贫雇手里。
    在发动贫雇的过程中，要反复的耐心的给他们讲贫雇贷款政策，使他们完全了解，并启发贫雇“掌权当主人”的自觉性。只有这样才能克服某些地方贫雇怕村干部，不敢大胆起来当家作主的现象。如涉县高家庄贫雇评议贷款的时候，首先给村干部留下一份，这种现象必须纠正。
    在贷款工作中，我们对村干部的态度，应当正确处理。他们中间有些是好的，愿意执行贷款政策，真正为贫雇所拥护。另一些坏的干部，由于发放贫雇贷款，他们得不到好处，在转贷时还要他们退出贷款，于是他们暗中破坏捣乱，阻挠贷款工作进行。我们为了减少贷款工作的阻碍，召开村干部会议传达贷款的政策和作法是必要的，但必须严格批评过去村干部多占贷款是错误的。这样一方面团结和教育好的村干部，争取他们来帮助这个工作的顺利进行（但主要不是依靠他们），另一方面孤立坏的村干部，给他们一种压力，使他们不敢进行破坏活动。总之我们对村干部的态度，是“团结好的，孤立坏的”的原则。
    （二）怎样解除贫雇贷款的思想顾虑？
    大部分贫雇没翻透身，需要贷款帮助他们解决生产困难，但是有些贫雇存在着不敢贷款的思想，有的说：“公家的款，手续麻烦，啥时要啥时就得还”，有的说：“咱找不见生产门路，贷款干啥用？”群众为什么会有这些顾虑呢？一方面是由于我们过去贷款，限制用途、手续不便利等缺点所造成的，在这次贷款中，一定要纠正。另一方面没有帮助贫雇具体算帐和订出生产计划，找生产门路。如沁县乔村王福印三辈当长工，没有翻透身，这次要贷给他款，他知道后发愁两天，不愿贷款。经我们进行访问，才知道他不敢贷款的原因，是年老了找不着生产门路，于是便把他组织在互助组一道生产，才解除了他的顾虑。由此证明我们不但要贷款给贫雇，还要帮助贫雇找生产门路，订生产计划。
    （三）团结中农问题
    发放贷款要注意两个原则：（一）必须尽可能满足贫雇要求（因贷款少，恐怕不能充分满足），这是贷款的基本任务。（二）必须坚决团结中农，避免发生中农和贫雇对立的现象。怎样团结呢？第一在转收旧贷时，对中农和地主富农的态度，应当有所区别。地主富农贷款要马上坚决收回，对合作社多占贷款，也要坚决收回，对某些真正困难的中农，只要通过贫雇评议，可对他照顾。邢台市在转贷中，把贷款户名单向群众公布，让贫雇讨论，那些户要立即收回，那些户可以缓期，这种办法是可以采用的。第二向中农进行政治教育，强调提出：“中农贫农是一家人”，“中农暂时不贷款将来可以贷款的”。组织贫雇和中农合作互助进行生产，太岳区提出：“中农拿游资，贫农拿贷款，合伙搞生产”的做法，一般是正确的。我们必须明白，在转贷时不能善于团结中农，造成贫雇在农村的孤立，对一切工作，都是不利的。
    （四）作风问题
    为贯彻贫雇路线，首先要深入贫雇、了解贫雇。怎样才能和贫雇亲密接近，了解他们的思想、情绪、困难、要求呢？首先要有和贫雇做朋友当贫雇好长工的精神，我们必须认识贫雇的感情、要求和我们的政策精神，是完全吻合的。他们对共产党的一切政策，是衷心拥护的，只要我们肯放下“官架子”，有事和贫雇商量，主动的到他们家中访心事，了解他们的困难和翻身情形，告诉他们各种政策，他们就会对我们讲出知心话。过去有些干部下乡，经常住在合作社或干部家里，使贫雇认为“干部吃的开，穷人吃不开”。这种只接近干部不接近群众的上层路线的作风，我们要坚决克服。
    另外在发动贫雇中，还应启发他们的阶级自觉性与积极性。教育他们从阶级利益着想，在自己当家作主之后，养成有事和大家商量的民主作风。防止少数贫雇积极分子传染一些“包办一切”的不良作风。
    以上这些问题必须在思想上，工作中明确的得到解决，才能贯彻贷款工作中的贫雇路线，才能把贷款工作做好。（冀南银行总行）
