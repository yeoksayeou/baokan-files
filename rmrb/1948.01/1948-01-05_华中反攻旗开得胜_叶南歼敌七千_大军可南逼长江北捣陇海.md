Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 3rd: The Central China People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 7,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit "encirclement and suppression" troops in the Ye Ting (i.e., Yancheng) to Wu @ (southeast of Ye Ting) area. Among them, in addition to those killed and wounded, over 3,000 Chiang bandit troops were captured alive, including Zhang Xiaoliu, deputy brigade commander of the Kuomintang's reorganized Fourth Division, Ninetieth Brigade. After the People's Liberation Army destroyed the three defense lines of Chiang's bandits on the southern front at the beginning of last month and annihilated more than 9,000 enemies, the Chiang bandit Ministry of National Defense hastily gathered three regiments of the Ninetieth Brigade of the reorganized Fourth Division and two regiments of the reorganized Fifty-first Division (rebuilt after being completely annihilated in the Battle of Lunan) from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and along the Grand Canal, totaling more than 17,000 men, to form the so-called "Encirclement and Suppression Column." Led by Wang Yan, commander of the reorganized Fifty-first Division, they rushed to the southern front for emergency rescue, claiming to "encircle and suppress" our army. The enemy first searched empty in counties such as Dongtai and Rugao, and then retreated to Dongtai city. On the morning of the 26th, they again moved north along the Tong (Nantong) Yu (Ganyu) Highway. However, the People's Liberation Army had already set up an encirclement, waiting for the enemy's vanguard to enter the Ye Ting and Wu @ area before launching a full-scale attack. In just one hour, except for the 270th Regiment and part of the 268th Regiment of the bandit Ninetieth Brigade who escaped, the rest were cut into several sections and tightly surrounded by us. After four days and nights of fierce fighting, the battle ended on the night of the 29th, and most of the bandits were annihilated. According to preliminary investigations, the entire brigade headquarters of the Ninetieth Brigade of the reorganized Fourth Division and its affiliated 269th Regiment, one battalion of the 268th Regiment, the division headquarters of the reorganized Fifty-first Division and its affiliated 121st Regiment of the 41st Brigade, and most of the 338th Regiment of the 113th Brigade were annihilated. Detailed battle results are still being verified.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 3rd: The Huazhong edition of Xinhua Daily (formerly Huazhong Daily, renamed from New Year's Day) published an editorial on New Year's Day, celebrating the great victory in Ye Nan, saying: "The great victory in Ye Nan is a great victory in which the Central China People's Liberation Army victoriously opened the prelude to a large-scale counter-offensive. It is a generous New Year's gift from the Chiang Kai-shek and Gu Zhutong bandits to the military and civilians of Central China, offering more than 7,000 troops of the 'Encirclement and Suppression Column' led by Wang Yan, commander of the reorganized Fifty-first Division, to the People's Liberation Army. This great victory shows the strength of the Central China military and civilians, who can not only fight a good all-people's guerrilla war, but also fight mobile and flexible large-scale mobile warfare, and each time they fight larger and fiercer, with improved technology and combat effectiveness than in the past." Talking about the future situation, the editorial said: "The Central China People's Liberation Army has grasped all the initiative, can advance to the Yangtze in the south and threaten Nanjing and Shanghai, can directly attack the Longhai Railway in the north and cooperate with Shandong, and can control the Grand Canal in the west and liberate both Huainan and Huaibei (and Huaiyin and Huai'an). They can rest when they want to rest, and fight when they want to fight. Although Chiang's bandits may still piece together troops to retaliate and 'sweep,' who can guarantee that they will not repeat the mistakes of the 'Encirclement and Suppression Column'?" The editorial called on the military and civilians of Central China to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions, not to be dizzy with victory, complacent and complacent, but to use their greatest efforts, work hard, and boldly and courageously advance into all areas behind Chiang, recover lost territories, and be vigilant and smash any desperate struggles of Chiang's bandits, vigorously strengthen the People's Liberation Army, and better fight hard battles and mobile warfare to complete the task of a large-scale counter-offensive and the liberation of Central China.

　　华中反攻旗开得胜
  　叶南歼敌七千
    大军可南逼长江北捣陇海
    【新华社华东前线三日电】华中解放军在叶挺（即盐城）到伍＠（在叶挺东南）地区歼灭蒋匪“进剿”部队七千多人，其中除毙伤外，活捉蒋匪整四师九十旅副旅长张晓柳以下三千多人。上月初旬解放军在南线摧毁蒋匪三道防线，歼敌九千多人后，蒋匪国防部慌忙从陇海线东段和运河沿线抽集整四师九十旅三个团和整五十一师（按系鲁南战役全歼后重建者）所属两个团，共一万七千多人，组织所谓“进剿纵队”，由整五十一师师长王严率领，赶到南线救急，扬言要“进剿”我军。该敌先在东台、如皋等县扑了空，缩回东台城。二十六日清早又沿通（南通）榆（赣榆）公路北犯，但解放军已布置好包围圈，等匪先头部队进到叶挺和伍＠一带就全面出击，仅一小时，除匪九十旅的二七○团和二六八团一部逃脱外，其余被我截成几段，紧紧包围。激战四昼夜，到二十九日夜结束战斗，匪大部被歼。据已查明者，歼匪整四师九十旅旅部和所属二六九团全部，二六八团一个营，整五十一师师部和所属四十一旅一二一团以及一一三旅三三八团大部，详细战果正清查中。
    【新华社华东前线三日电】新华日报华中版（按系华中日报，元旦起改称）在元旦发表社论，庆祝叶南大捷说：“叶南的大捷，是华中人民解放军胜利揭开大举反攻序幕的大捷，是蒋介石、顾祝同匪徒送给我华中军民的一份新年厚礼，把整五十一师师长王严所率的‘进剿纵队’七千多人马献给了解放军。这一大捷说明华中军民力量的壮大，不仅能打好全民的游击战争，又能打机动灵活的大规模运动战，而且一次比一次打得大、打得猛，技术和战斗力都比过去提高了”。谈到今后的形势时，社论说：“华中解放军已掌握一切主动权，南可进逼长江、威胁京沪，北可直捣陇海、配合山东，西可控制运河、解放两淮（淮南淮北和淮阴淮安），要休整就休整，要打仗就打仗。虽说蒋匪还可能再拼凑兵力来报复‘扫荡’，谁能担保不重蹈‘进剿纵队’的覆辙。”社论号召华中军民，要坚决执行毛主席的指示，不要被胜利冲昏头脑，麻痹自满，而应用最大努力，艰苦奋斗，大胆勇猛向所有蒋后地区进军，收复失地，并警惕和粉碎蒋匪任何垂死挣扎，猛力壮大解放军，更好地打攻坚战和运动战，来完成大举反攻、解放华中的任务。
