Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 17th: Manila dispatch: The People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Philippine Communist Party, is growing stronger in its continuous attacks against the enemy, greatly alarming the American imperialist lackey and traitor to the Philippines, Roxas. Recently, the Roxas reactionary government has once again deployed troops, vowing to "crush the people's armed forces in the provinces of Bulacan and Quezon." However, according to news from the 8th, the Philippine people's guerrilla warfare is vigorously developing in the aforementioned areas. In the town of Bokou, only 31 kilometers from Manila, an unprecedented fierce battle recently took place. More than 50 well-equipped soldiers of the People's Liberation Army (part of the People's Liberation Army based in the Sierra Madre Mountains) attacked a position held by 200 Roxas troops, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Taruc, leader of the Philippine People's Liberation Army, issued a statement on the 12th, rejecting the Roxas bandits' "unconditional surrender" ultimatum and severely condemning the traitorous crimes of the Philippine traitor Roxas, stating: "The People's Liberation Army will never surrender. We have not committed any crimes. We are fighting for an independent, democratic, and peaceful life. Why should we surrender? Only those who have committed crimes against the people should surrender!" He called on the Philippine people to persist in the patriotic war of self-defense. It is reported that Taruc is one of the founders of the Philippine People's Liberation Army (formerly the People's Anti-Japanese Army) and also one of the leaders of the Philippine Communist Party. He is only 34 years old this year. When the Japanese bandits surrendered, he refused the reactionary order of American imperialism to disarm the People's Anti-Japanese Army, and led his troops in the provinces of Pampanga, Bulacan, and Nueva Ecija in central Luzon to launch the struggle against the United States and Roxas, establish a democratic regime, and carry out land reform. In this area, 98% of the land was concentrated in the hands of a very small number of landlords, and it has now been distributed to the peasants. In the liberated areas under Taruc's command, the broad masses of peasants are rising up to join the army and participate in the war.

    【新华社陕北十七日电】马尼拉讯：菲律宾共产党领导下的人民解放军，在不断攻击敌人的战斗中壮大，使美帝国主义走狗菲奸罗哈斯大为惊慌。最近罗哈斯反动政府又调兵遣将，扬言要“粉碎布拉干与奎松两省”的人民武装。但据八日消息，菲律宾人民游击战争，正在上述区域蓬勃开展，距马尼拉仅三十一公里之波沟镇，近曾发生空前激战，五十余名配备优良之人民解放军（系锡拉马德利山区根据地人民解放军的一部分），曾袭击驻有二百名罗哈斯军的阵地，予敌重大伤亡。菲律宾人民解放军领袖塔拉克十二日发表谈话，他拒斥罗匪“无条件投降”之通牒，并痛责菲奸罗哈斯之叛国罪行称：“人民解放军决不投降。我们并未犯罪，我们为争取独立、民主、和平的生活而战，我们为什么应该投降呢？只有那些犯有反人民之罪的人才应该投降！”他号召菲律宾人民坚持爱国自卫战争。按塔拉克系菲律宾人民解放军（其前身即人民抗日军）创始人之一，亦为菲共领袖之一，今年才三十四岁。日寇投降时，他拒绝美帝国主义解除人民抗日军武装的反动命令，率部在吕宋中部之巴邦加、布拉干、爱西加诸省发动反美反罗哈斯之斗争，建立民主政权并进行土地改革，该区集中于极少数地主手里的土地达百分之九十八，现已分配给农民。在塔拉克所部解放地区，广大农民正奋起参军参战。
