Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Athens dispatch: Simultaneously with the announcement of the establishment of the Greek People's Democratic Government, the Greek Democratic Army launched powerful offensives on all fronts. A unit of the Democratic Army, on December 26th of last year, "with incredible tenacity" (TASS), fiercely attacked the fortified stronghold of Konacha, a military point occupied by bandit troops five miles from the Albanian border, and completely surrounded the city. The besieged puppet troops are now being supplied by the puppet air force. The Athens puppet government has urgently dispatched its Minister of the Army, Stchettas, to fly to the city to personally direct the battle. In the eight-day battle for the city, the bandit troops suffered 450 casualties. Another unit of the Democratic Army attacked a large number of puppet troops in southern Ionia and cut the supply lines of the puppet troops to Epirus into several sections. The commands of the Democratic Army in Thrace, Western Macedonia, and Rumelia have also launched successful attacks in recent days, liberating many villages, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, and seizing a large amount of war booty.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Athens dispatch: Radio Free Greece broadcast an order on the 3rd from General Markos, Premier of the Greek Democratic Government, strongly stating: "The plans of American and British imperialism and their lackeys to launch a civil war and enslave Greece have completely failed." The order pointed out: "1947 has proven that the royalist fascists cannot defeat the Democratic Army, nor can they realize their plan to turn Greece into a strong base against its neighbors and the Soviet Union. Although we have encountered all kinds of difficulties, we have shattered all their plans. We have built a regular Democratic Army from a small detachment, and we have won the trust and love of the people of Greece." The order called on the Greek people and the Democratic Army to strengthen their struggle against the enemy, bravely overcome difficulties, and strive for final victory.

　　希腊民主政府成立时
  　民主军发动各线猛攻
    【新华社陕北八日电】雅典讯：与希腊人民民主政府宣布成立同时，希腊民主军在各线发动了强大攻势。民主军一部于去年十二月二十六日，“以难以令人置信的顽强性”（塔斯社），猛攻距阿尔巴尼亚边境五哩之科纳柴匪军军略据点，并团团包围该城。被围伪军之供应现均靠伪空军运送。雅典伪政府已急派其陆军部长斯彻他斯飞该城亲自指挥作战。在该城八天的争夺战中，匪军伤亡达四百五十人。民主军另部进攻爱奥尼亚南部大量伪军，并将至爱匹鲁斯的伪军供应线截成数段。民主军色雷斯、西马其顿与陆麦里亚各指挥部所部，连日亦胜利出击，解放村庄多处，予敌重大杀伤，并缴获大量战利品。
    【新华社陕北八日电】雅典讯：自由希腊电台三日广播希民主政府总理马科斯将军之命令，力称：“美、英帝国主义及其从仆发动内战及奴役希腊的计划，已完全失败了。”该命令指出：“一九四七年已经证明保皇党法西斯不能打败民主军，也不能实现他们把希腊变为反对其邻邦及苏联的强固据点的计划。虽然我们曾遇到一切困难，但我们已粉碎了他们的一切计划。我们已经由一个小队而建立成正规的民主军了，我们已经赢得希腊全国人民的信任与爱戴”。命令号召希腊人民及民主军加强对敌斗争，勇敢地克服困难，以争取最后胜利。
