Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Shanghai News: With the tacit approval of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government, two Japanese fishing boats invaded the Zhejiang sea area. One of them is named "Tokuyo Maru". Both ships have a deadweight tonnage of more than 100 tons and sailed to fish three nautical miles from the coastal reefs of Zhejiang. The activities of Japanese fishing boats invading China are a planned act under the collusion and connivance of the US and Chiang Kai-shek. On the 7th of last month, two Japanese fishing boats were discovered in the Zhejiang sea area, and on the 27th, another ten Japanese fishing boats were discovered.
   
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Shanghai newspaper news: "UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)" colludes with Chiang Kai-shek bandits to continue large-scale fishing in the Chinese coastal waters. At the beginning of last month, eight "UNRRA" fishing boats fully loaded with fresh fish were transported to Shanghai for dumping. Taiwan, Ningbo, Wenzhou and other places also frequently have "UNRRA" fishing boats transporting fish for sale. The United States, through "UNRRA," is invading and endangering China's private fishing industry, which has aroused public outrage in the Chinese fishing industry. At the beginning of last month, Shanghai fish merchants launched a boycott movement, forcing five of the eight "UNRRA" fishing boats to be unable to unload their cargo. UNRRA personnel said: These 120,000 dan of fish can only be used as fertilizer.

　　蒋贼出卖我国海面美日渔船侵入打鱼
  　上海鱼商发动抵制运动
    【新华社陕北十六日电】上海消息：在蒋匪政府默许下，日本渔船两艘侵入浙江海面，其中一艘名“德洋丸”两船载重量皆在百吨以上，并驶至距浙江沿岸海礁三海里处捕鱼。按日本渔船侵华活动，系美蒋勾结纵容下有计划之行为，上月七日浙江海面即已发现日本渔船二艘，二十七日又续发现日本渔轮十艘。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】沪报消息：“联总”与蒋匪勾结，继续在中国沿海进行大规模捕鱼。上月初即有“联总”满装鲜鱼之八艘渔轮运沪倾销。台湾、宁波、温州等地亦经常有“联总”渔轮运往销售。美国通过“联总”侵略、危害中国民营渔业，已激起中国渔业界公愤。上月初沪市鱼商曾发动抵制运动，迫使“总联”八艘渔船中有五艘不能卸货。行总人员说：这十二万担鱼，只能当肥料用了。
