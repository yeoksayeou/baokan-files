  　Pay Tribute to Canadian Workers
  　Thanking Them for Refusing to Transport Arms to Aid Chiang
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: According to a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 7th: The All-China Student Federation and the China Labor Association paid tribute to the Canadian working class for refusing to transport arms to aid Chiang Kai-shek. In a letter to the Vancouver Labor Council (note that workers there refused to load arms for the Canadian government to aid Chiang), the Labor Association stated: "On behalf of the Chinese workers, we extend our deepest respect to you. We hope that your protest action is only a beginning, and will become a call to workers in all countries, especially the United States, calling on them to respond to you with strong actions, thus helping the Chinese people to achieve independence, peace, and democracy." The China Student Federation also expressed the same deep respect in letters to Canadian workers and university students.
    In addition, according to a dispatch from Ottawa by the same agency: Canadian Member of Parliament Archibald expressed firm opposition to the Canadian government providing arms and military supplies to aid Chiang Kai-shek and training air force personnel for the Chiang bandits within Canadian territory. Archibald condemned the Canadian government's move, saying that it was actually helping fascism.

    【新华社陕北九日电】据塔斯社南京七日电：中华全国学联及中国劳动协会向拒绝运输军火援蒋的加拿大工人阶级致敬。劳协于致温哥华（按该地工人曾拒绝为加政府装运军火援蒋）劳工委员会函中称：“我们代表中国工人向你们致深切的敬礼。我们希望你们的抗议行动仅为一个开始，而将成为对一切国家特别是美国工人的一个号召，号召他们以强有力的行动响影你们，因而有助于中国人民获得独立、和平、民主”。中国学联给加拿大工人及大学生的函件中，亦表示同样深切敬意。
    另据该社渥太华讯：加拿大众议员阿柴巴德表示坚决反对加政府以军火及军事物资援蒋及在加境为蒋匪训练空军人员。阿氏谴责加政府此举，实际上是帮助法西斯主义。
