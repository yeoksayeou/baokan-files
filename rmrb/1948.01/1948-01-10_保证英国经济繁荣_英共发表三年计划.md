Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. London Dispatch: The British Communist Party announced on the 2nd a three-year plan to guarantee the economic prosperity of Great Britain. It calls for the organization of a "Left-Wing" Labour government, resolutely implementing the Labour Party's election platform. The plan formally demands expanding investment in the economy to update British industrial equipment and solve the housing shortage. To this end, the plan strongly advocates greatly reducing the size of the armed forces and increasing trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. Regarding the issue of increasing coal production, the British Communist Party's plan proposes that coal production should reach 233 million tons in 1948, and steel production should also reach 1.5 million tons this year. The British Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, commented on this plan, stating: The purpose of the plan is to illustrate the demands of the British people, namely to improve the equipment of important industries, raise the people's living standards, and restore political and economic independence. Because without economic independence, there can be no political independence. Because the government has deprived industry of its labor force and maintained a huge army, it has delayed Britain's recovery and made Britain dependent on the United States. The Daily Worker also stated: This plan refutes the nonsense of Labour Secretary Philip that the British Communist Party intends to sabotage Britain's recovery.

　　保证英国经济繁荣
  　英共发表三年计划
    【新华社陕北七日电】伦敦讯：英国共产党二日发表一项保证大不列颠经济繁荣的三年计划，其中要求组织一个“左冀”工党政府，坚决实行工党的竞选纲领，计划正式要求扩大经济中的投资，以更新英国工业装备，并解决房荒。为此，计划力主大大减低武装部队的数量，增加对苏联与对东欧各国的贸易。英共计划中关于增加煤产问题，提出于一九四八年煤产应达两亿三千三百吨，而钢生产亦应于本年内达到一千五百吨。英共机关报工人日报对此计划评称：该计划之目的说明：英国人民的要求，即改良重要工业的装备，提高人民生活水平并恢复政治与经济的独立。因为没有经济的独立，就不可能有政治的独立。由于政府剥夺了工业中的劳动力，维持着庞大的军队，因此延宕了英国的恢复，并使英国依赖于美国。工人日报并称：该计划驳斥了工党书记菲力浦说什么英共打算对英国的恢复实行怠工的胡说。
