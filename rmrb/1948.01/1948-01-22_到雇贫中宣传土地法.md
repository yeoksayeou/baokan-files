　　Propagandize the Land Law Among Hired and Poor Peasants
    Since the promulgation of the Land Law, we have received various reflections, and many have been published in the newspapers. How many of these reflections are from hired and poor peasants? Even if they are reflections from hired and poor peasants, what percentage of them are truthful? This is still worth questioning and studying.
    We have found that most of what hired and poor peasants hear now is hearsay and rumors, even passed on from the mouths of landlords, rich peasants, or a few bad cadres. Some of these are exaggerations, while others are deliberate distortions. For example, in Hexi Village in Wu'an, there is a saying circulating: "The Land Law is to unite rich peasants, unite middle peasants, not touch rich peasants, and not touch middle peasants"; "What was seized from landlords should be returned to them." This is the public opinion of landlords and rich peasants, used to scare hired and poor peasants, isolate hired and poor peasants, attack hired and poor peasants, and distort the Land Law.
    In this situation, if no one comes out to correctly explain the Land Law to hired and poor peasants, giving the landlords' and rich peasants' public opinion a head-on blow, it will only make hired and poor peasants more suspicious and more afraid to act. In Hexi, an old farmhand of thirty years dared to speak only after the staff of the local office closed the doors and windows. When asked for his opinion on the Land Law, he said, "I dare not say." It is evident that making hired and poor peasants truly accept the Land Law, treating it as their own weapon of struggle, understanding that they must take their fate into their own hands, and expressing their true opinions from the bottom of their hearts, is an extremely patient and arduous task; all careless, impatient, and simplistic approaches are unworkable. In order to break the current formalism in propagandizing the Land Law (reading it once in winter school as a matter of routine, or simply convening meetings of cadres and a few active hired and poor peasants to convey it), and to overcome the spontaneity in propaganda, we hope that all organs, after reorganizing their ranks, will combine the study of the Land Law with all cadres going deep into the hired and poor peasant stratum, visiting them door-to-door, and conducting propaganda based on the specific situation of each hired and poor peasant, refuting the distortions of the Land Law by landlords and rich peasants, and enlightening the hired and poor peasants to consciously accept the Land Law; we must listen to their opinions with the greatest enthusiasm, and then reflect them back, as an important preparatory work for the implementation of the Land Law in all areas.

### 到雇贫中宣传土地法

　　到雇贫中宣传土地法
    土地法下来后，我们已经接到了各种反映，报上也登了不少；在这些反映里面，有多少是雇贫的反映？即使是雇贫的反映，又有百分之几十的真实性？确还值得怀疑和研究。
    我们发现雇贫目前听到的多半是风声和传闻，甚至是从地主富农或少数坏干部的嘴里传过去的。其中有的是以讹传讹，有的则是故意曲解。譬如在武安河西村流传的就有这样说法：“土地法是团结富农，团结中农，不动富农，不动中农”；“把斗地主的东西还要还给人家”。这是地主富农的舆论，用来吓唬雇贫，孤立雇贫，打击雇贫，曲解土地法的。
    在这种情况下，如果没有人出来正确的向雇贫解释土地法，给地主、富农舆论一个迎头痛击，那就使雇贫更加怀疑，更加不敢动。河西有一位三十年的老长工听驻地机关工作人员讲土地法，他亲自把门窗关上，才敢说话。问他对土地法的意见，还说：“咱不敢说。”可见让雇贫农真正接受土地法，把它当做自己的斗争武器，懂得把命运操在自己的手里，从内心里表示自己的真实的意见，是一件极其耐心的艰苦的工作；一切粗枝大叶、急性病、简单化的作风都是不行的。为了打破目前宣传土地法的形式主义（照例在冬学上念一遍，或单纯召开干部和少数雇贫积极分子会议传达），以及克服宣传上的自流性，我们希望各机关在整编队伍之后，结合上土地法的学习，全体干部深入雇贫层，挨门挨户的访问雇贫，根据每个雇贫的具体情况进行宣传，驳斥地主富农对土地法的曲解，启发雇贫自觉的接受土地法；一定要以最大的热情听取他们的意见，然后反映出来，作为全区各地执行土地法的一个重要的准备工作。
