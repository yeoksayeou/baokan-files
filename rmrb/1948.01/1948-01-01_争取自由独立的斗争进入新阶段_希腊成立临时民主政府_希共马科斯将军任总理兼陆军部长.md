　　Struggle for Freedom and Independence Enters New Stage
  　Greek Provisional Democratic Government Established
    Communist General Markos Appointed Prime Minister and Minister of the Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th] Due to the victories of the Greek Democratic Army and the maturation of the reactionary government's crisis, the Greek people's struggle for freedom and independence has entered a new stage. According to TASS from Athens on the 24th: The Provisional People's Democratic Government of the Greek liberated areas has been established. The known cabinet list is as follows: Prime Minister and Minister of the Army, General Markos (Communist); Minister of Foreign Affairs, Petros Roussos (Communist); Minister of the Interior, Giannis Ioannidis (Communist); Minister of National Economy, Stratis Springos (Peasant Party); Minister of Social Relief, Professor Kokkalis (renowned Greek surgeon); Minister of Justice, Porfyrogenis (Party affiliation unknown).
    According to Agence France-Presse: After the government was established, Prime Minister Markos issued a declaration stating that the current tasks of the new government are: First, to continue the struggle to liberate Greece from the oppression of foreign imperialists and for national sovereignty, the rights of the Greek people, and democratic freedom. Second, to govern the country according to democratic principles. Third, to strive for peace and national unity. The declaration continued: The government has decided to send representatives to foreign countries and to rebuild friendly relations with democratic countries and their governments, and to convene a national congress as soon as circumstances permit.
    The establishment of the Greek Provisional People's Democratic Government has terrified the U.S. and British imperialists and the reactionary Greek monarchy, throwing them into chaos. The pseudo-Deputy Prime Minister Tsaldaris immediately convened an "emergency meeting," attended by all ministers and key officials. Representatives of the U.S. delegation in Greece and the U.S. Embassy in Greece, as well as the British Ambassador, also held meetings with the pseudo-Greek Deputy Prime Minister Tsaldaris and key ministers to discuss the "domestic and international issues" arising from this matter. At the same time, the "United Nations Balkan Committee," a tool of U.S. imperialism currently engaged in "investigations" in Greece, also met in Thessaloniki to discuss matters related to this.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th] Athens News: After the establishment of the Greek Provisional People's Democratic Government, it has put forward a new democratic governing program for the construction of Greece. In a declaration issued by Prime Minister Markos after the establishment of the new government, he explicitly stated: "The general policy of the democratic government aims to awaken all the power of the people and liberate Greece from U.S. and British imperialism and its Greek puppets. It aims to govern the country according to the principles of people's democracy, implement the nationalization of all concerns, large banks, and heavy industries, carry out land reform, and grant equal status to ethnic minorities." In addressing foreign policy, the declaration forcefully stated: "The democratic government will strive to restore friendly relations with all countries, and especially strive to establish close and friendly relations with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th] Athens News: The Greek Democratic Army broadcast that the leading organs of the Greek Peasant Party of Epirus and Eastern Thrace recently held a meeting in the liberated areas. After the meeting, a letter to the leading organs and all members of the party was issued. After vehemently criticizing the U.S. and British imperialists' attempts to turn Greece into their colony and the treasonous crimes of the Greek fascist reactionary ruling clique, the letter called on farmers and people throughout Greece not to succumb to violence and terror, to actively participate in the Democratic Army, and to provide all support to the Democratic Army, resolutely fighting for independence, freedom, and democracy.

    【新华社陕北二十六日电】雅典讯：希腊民主军广播称：希腊农民党爱匹鲁斯科孚与东色雷斯的领导机关，最近在解放区举行会议。会后发表告该党领导机关及全体党员书，该书于猛抨美英帝国主义企图把希腊变为他们的殖民地及希腊法西斯反动统治集团卖国之罪行后，号召希腊全国农民及全国人民不屈服于暴力与恐怖，踊跃参加民主军，并给民主军一切支援，坚决为独立自由与民主而战。
