Article 10: All cases judged by the People's Court that require execution by governments at all levels shall be handled within the following scope: (A) Those sentenced to corvée labor may be entrusted to the local village government to supervise the execution.

Article 17: These regulations shall come into effect from the date of promulgation, and any matters not covered may be amended by the Northeast Administrative Committee.

Detailed Rules for the People's Court are as follows: (1) In handling cases, the People's Court shall, in addition to accepting the opinions of the masses, abide by the provisions of these detailed rules. (2) The division of labor and responsibilities of each trial committee member of the People's Court are as follows: (A) The chairman is the chairman of the trial committee and is fully responsible for the trial. (B) The inspectors are responsible for receiving accusations from the people, reporting the criminal facts of the defendant, conducting investigations and research, collecting materials and evidence, and presenting public prosecutions on behalf of the people. (C) The judges conduct trials of the defendant's confessions, collect materials, study the opinions of the masses, and propose opinions on sentencing. (D) The clerk is responsible for writing, recording judgments, and organizing case files. (3) When the People's Court needs to arrest a criminal based on reports from the people or upon the accusation of an inspector, it shall notify the local government to dispatch the self-defense forces to assist in the process. (4) If the People's Court uncovers a political case, it shall notify the public security organs at any time to cooperate in investigation and handling. (5) The People's Court generally does not adhere to a fixed format; during mass struggle meetings, the mass struggle meeting can also be turned into a mass public trial meeting. During formal court hearings, a trial seat can be set up in the front, and inspector seats and clerk seats can be set up on both sides. Representatives elected by mass organizations should participate in the jury and be seated on both sides, and the people should be allowed to participate and have the right to speak. Secret trials are not allowed. (6) When the People's Court tries cases, it should adopt the mass line, focusing on investigation and research, and collecting human and material evidence, rather than focusing solely on the defendant's confession. (7) When the People's Court orders the confiscation of property, it should notify the local government and peasant association to cooperate in the investigation, inventory, and handling. (8) The People's Court should have a case registration book, which should contain the defendant's name, gender, age, place of origin, class background, occupation, and other items, as well as the criminal facts and the decision of the trial, and should be registered separately according to the nature of the case in the following three categories for reference: (A) Registration book for cases of mass struggle targets; (B) Registration book for political cases; (C) Registration book for cases of cadres and others. (9) After a case is judged, a judgment should be made immediately, written, and announced, and the person concerned should be notified. The content of the judgment should include three points in addition to the defendant's name and resume: (A) Criminal facts; (B) Reasons for the judgment; (C) Sentences. (10) If there are additional penalties (such as deprivation of civil rights, confiscation of property) in addition to the main penalty (such as death penalty, imprisonment) for the convicted person, they should be noted in the judgment. (11) The village where the district People's Court is located may not set up a separate village court, and its work will be handled concurrently by the district court. If necessary, trial personnel may be increased, but the organization remains at the district and village levels to facilitate appeals. (12) These detailed rules shall come into effect from the date of promulgation, and any matters not covered may be amended by the Northeast Administrative Committee.
