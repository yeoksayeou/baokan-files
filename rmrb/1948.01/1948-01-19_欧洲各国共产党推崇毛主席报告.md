　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. Belgrade dispatch: The report "The Current Situation and Our Tasks" made by Chairman Mao Zedong, leader of the Chinese Communist Party, at the Central Committee of the CCP, has aroused great attention from the Communist Parties of Europe. The fifth issue of the organ of the Information Bureau of the Nine Communist Parties, "For Lasting Peace and People's Democracy," published here on January 15th, has published the full text of Chairman Mao's report. The editorial of that issue, "Striving for the Unity of the Working Class," declares: "Bevin, Blum, Saragat, and Schumacher are playing the role of American agents. They are trying to conceal their relationship with Schuman and De Gaulle of France, Churchill of England, and Gasperi of Italy under the guise of the so-called 'Third Force'." The editorial points out that they are clearing the way for American imperialist expansion and interference in the internal affairs of various countries. The issue also contains the report of Togliatti, leader of the Italian Communist Party, at the Sixth Congress of the Italian Communist Party, the letter from the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party to its members, and special articles such as "French Trade Unions Oppose Splitters." The previous issue contained Marcos's declaration on the composition and policies of the Greek democratic government.

　　欧洲各国共产党推崇毛主席报告
    【新华社陕北十七日电】贝尔格莱德讯：中共领袖毛泽东主席在中共中央委员会上所作“目前形势和我们的任务”的报告，已引起欧洲各国共产党的极端重视，一月十五日在此间出版的九国共产党情报局机关刊物“争取巩固的和平与人民的民主”第五期，已将毛主席报告的全文登载。该期社论为“争取工人阶级队伍的团结”，宣称：“贝文、勃鲁姆、萨拉盖特、舒马赫扮演着美国代理人的角色。他们力图在所谓‘第三种势力’的掩盖下，隐蔽他们与法国的舒曼及戴高乐、英国的邱吉尔、意大利的加斯贝利等人的关系”。社论指出他们替美帝国主义扩张和干涉各国内政扫清了道路。该期并载有意共领袖托格里亚蒂在意共六次代表大会上的报告，捷共中央告党员书，以及“法国职工会反对分裂者”等专文。前一期则载有马科斯关于希腊民主政府的组成及其政策的宣言。
