Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 3rd. The results of the Jinan People's Liberation Army's liberation of Yuncheng: a total of over 10,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the 369th Regiment, 150th Regiment, and 182nd Regiment of the 123rd Brigade of the 36th Division, Yan Xishan's Bandit Protection 5th Regiment, the 5th Special Office, and 16 puppet county governments were annihilated. Over 2,000 enemy soldiers including the 250th Regiment Commander An Zhizhong were killed, and over 8,100 enemy soldiers were captured, including the 182nd Regiment Commander Lei Wenqing, 250th Regiment Deputy Commander Hu Yulong, and 5th Special Commissioner Hou Pinhan. Preliminary statistics show the following was seized: 4 howitzers, 2 infantry guns, 2 heavy mortars, 43 mortars, 1 anti-tank gun, 1 rocket launcher, 32 60mm mortars, 45 heavy machine guns, 568 light machine guns, 1,700 rifles, 7 grenade launchers, 9 projectors, 1 flamethrower, 51 submachine guns, over 5,700 rounds of various artillery shells, 42 radio stations, 2 radiotelephones, 2 telephone exchanges, 224 telephones, 25 radios, and over 100 vehicles. One plane was shot down. Many other items were seized and are still being inventoried.

Taiyue, this newspaper, 3rd. The spokesman of the Jinan People's Liberation Army Headquarters, after our army liberated Yuncheng and Anyi, made a statement saying: The Jinan battlefield, like other battlefields across the country, when our people launched a large-scale counteroffensive, the bandit Hu Zongnan showed the embarrassing situation of "robbing Peter to pay Paul" and being stretched thin. Every action on our Jinan battlefield is closely coordinated with the various battlefields across the country. Last September, when the Chen-Xie army conducted the Tongguan-Shaanxi campaign, the bandit Hu Zongnan hurriedly drew troops from Linfen and Yuncheng in southern Shanxi, but was held back by the People's Liberation Army, which occupied two airfields, so bandit Hu Zongnan was so anxious that he could not run away on land or fly away from the air. On September 8th, our army began to surround Yuncheng. During this period, when the Chen-Xie army was developing southward, bandit Hu Zongnan again drew troops from northern Shaanxi, attempting to open the Longhai Railway and save the demise of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, but Yuncheng was on the eve of our army's general offensive, which forced bandit Hu Zongnan to abandon his original plan. He immediately ordered the 36th Division Commander Zhong Song to bring four brigades to reinforce Yuncheng. Our army took the initiative to withdraw from the encirclement of Yuncheng and concentrated its main force to fight the reinforcements. Bandit Hu Zongnan paid the price of 3,700 people being annihilated, and only sent three companies of the 250th Regiment and the remnants of Lei Wenqing's 182nd Regiment to Yuncheng. The so-called bandit Hu Zongnan's reinforcements were beaten by us and fled to the south bank of the Yellow River. This kind of piecemeal reinforcement did not save the crisis of the Yuncheng enemy being annihilated. On the contrary, he sent us a lot of personnel, weapons, and ammunition. At this point, our army rested for a while, and on December 17th continued to besiege Yuncheng. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, all obstacles to the city were cleared. This campaign coincided with the Liu-Deng, Chen-Su, and Chen-Xie armies' great destruction of the Pinghan and Longhai Railways. Bandit Hu Zongnan was forced to rush eight brigades, which were pieced together to reinforce the Longhai Railway, to Shanzhou on December 27th, lingering along the Yellow River. That night, we launched a general offensive against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Yuncheng. After a night of fierce fighting, Yuncheng was liberated. The remnant bandits who broke through and fled were also completely annihilated by us. Bandit Hu Zongnan's reinforcements became defeated soldiers and finally suffered a setback. Then the spokesman pointed out: The entire process of the Yuncheng campaign is a picture of bandit Hu Zongnan's panic in the face of the People's Liberation Army's large-scale counteroffensive. Comparing us with the enemy, this issue is very meaningful. We are proactive everywhere, coordinating the counteroffensive against the enemy from the interior and exterior lines, and annihilating the enemy, but the enemy is passive everywhere, being beaten and annihilated from both the interior and exterior lines. In the middle, he even pieced together a so-called "mobile unit," which, under our command, bumped into the south and suffered setbacks in the north. However, bandit Hu Zongnan is always reluctant to automatically abandon this isolated strategic stronghold completely surrounded by the liberated area's military and civilians. This is the conservatism of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, which is reflected in the strategic guidance that the Chiang-Hu bandit gang still wants to rely on the so-called "modernized defensive fortifications" to hold on to isolated strongholds. But repeated facts have proved that in front of the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party, there is no invincible fortress. The Chiang-Hu bandit gang also mistakenly believed that our army had launched a large-scale attack on the outer lines, and the inner lines were no longer able to counterattack. Isn't this another mistake? Facts have proved that our interior forces are still strong, not only holding the enemy and preventing him from leaving, but also annihilating him here. If the Hu Zongnan bandit officers and soldiers do not want to be annihilated, they can only lay down their weapons. No matter what methods Chiang-Hu Zongnan wants to rely on, such as fortifications, firepower, reinforcements, and conscription, they cannot save his incurable disease of insufficient military strength and low morale. In short, the Jinan battlefield is a microcosm of the national battlefield, the same showing that the enemy is getting weaker and smaller as he fights, until he is completely annihilated. Our army is getting stronger and larger as it fights, and will eventually win complete victory. The spokesman talked about the significance of our army's liberation of Yuncheng and Anyi: In military terms, it further enhances our army's mobile strength. To the south, it can control the Longhai Railway, and to the west, it can go out to Guanzhong. With a consolidated southern Shanxi, it can better support the Henan-Shaanxi operations. Politically, it destroyed the old nest of the reactionary forces in southern Shanxi. Yan Xishan's three special offices, sixteen exiled county governments, and thousands of evil landlords, the targets of struggle, were all swept away, removing a large stone slab from the people of southern Shanxi, blocking a large "air-raid shelter," which will greatly promote the ongoing land reform movement. Economically, it controls the Lucun Salt Pond, which can supply salt to most areas of Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces, adding huge wealth to the liberated areas. This campaign is also a huge exercise and test for our troops. The Yuncheng campaign shows that our army can not only fight mobile warfare, but also fight offensive warfare and positional warfare. Whether it is earthwork operations, defending positions, or combined infantry, artillery, and engineering operations, we have gained many valuable experiences, which will lay the foundation for us to fight more and greater victories in the future. Speaking here, the spokesman recalled the past with a very optimistic tone: "At this time last year, the Chiang-Hu bandit gang still wanted to seize Shanxi and ride on the heads of the people of Shanxi, looking for his happiness, so he moved his family and so on here, but today the Chiang-Hu bandits trapped in Yuncheng are exactly going the wrong way, and just found their graves in Yuncheng."

　　运城战役歼敌万余
    证明我内线兵力雄厚足可拔除一切孤立据点
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫三日电】晋南解放军解放运城战果：计歼灭蒋匪三六师一二三旅之三六九团、一五○团、一八二团，阎匪保五团，第五专署及十六个伪县府共万余名。击毙二五○团团长安知中以下两千余名，俘一八二团团长雷文清、二五○团副团长胡玉龙、五专员侯频翰以下八千一百余名。据初步统计：缴获榴弹炮四门、步兵炮二门、重迫击炮二门、迫击炮四三门、战防炮一门、火箭筒一个，六○小炮三二门、重机枪四十五挺、轻机枪五六八挺、步枪一千七百支，掷弹筒七个，投掷器九个，火焰喷射器一个，冲锋式五十一支，各种炮弹五千七百余发，电台四二部，报话机二部，电话总机二部，电话机二二四部，收音机二五付，汽车百余辆。击落飞机一架。其他缴获甚多，继续清查中。
    【本报太岳三日电】晋南人民解放军司令部发言人，对我军解放运城、安邑后发表谈话称：晋南战场和全国其他战场一样，当我人民大举反攻之际，胡匪即表现了挖肉补疮、捉襟见肘的窘态，而我晋南战场的每一行动，又和全国各个战场起着密切的配合作用。去年九月间，陈谢大军进行潼陕战役的时候，胡匪手忙脚乱的自晋南临汾、运城抽兵，但被人民解放军拉住了，占领了两处飞机场，急的胡匪从陆地跑不了，从空中也飞不走。九月八号，我军开始包围运城，这个期间，正是陈谢大军向南发展的时候，胡匪又从陕北抽兵，企图打通陇海路，拯救蒋家匪帮的覆灭，但是运城正在我军总攻前夜，又迫使胡匪放弃原订计划，即令三十六师师长钟松带着四个旅来增援运城，我军便主动撤围运城，集中主力打援，胡匪付出了三千七百人被歼灭的代价，仅把二五○团三个连及一八二团雷文清残部送到了运城。所谓胡匪援军便被我打的溃窜黄河南岸，此种拆东墙补西墙的增援，丝毫没有挽救了运城敌人被歼灭的危机，相反的他又给我们送来了不少的人员、武器、弹药。至此，我军稍事休整，于十二月十七日继续围攻运城，经三昼夜的激烈战斗，便全部扫清登城障碍。这次战役正配合了刘邓、陈粟、陈谢三路大军大破平汉路陇海路，胡匪又被迫把拼凑用来增援陇海路的八个旅，星夜兼程，于十二月二十七日赶到陕州、徘徊于黄河沿岸之际，我即在当晚，对运城蒋匪发动总攻，经一夜激烈战斗，运城即告解放，突围逃窜的残匪，亦被我全部歼灭，胡匪援兵倒成了溃兵，最后还是碰了一鼻子灰。接着发言人又指出：运城战役的全部过程，正是胡匪在人民解放军大举反攻面前表现手忙脚乱的一幅图画。把我们和敌人对比的看，这个问题非常有意味，我们处处表现主动，从内外线配合着反攻敌人，歼灭敌人，敌人却处处表现被动，内外线都是挨打被歼灭，并且中间还拼凑一股所谓“机动部队”，在我们的指挥下，南撞一头、北碰一鼻子的两头挨打。但是，胡匪总舍不得自动放弃这个完全被解放区军民包围着的孤立战略据点，这是大地主大资产阶级的保守性，在战略指导上，反映出蒋胡匪帮还要想凭借所谓“现代化防御筑城”，固守孤立据点，但历次事实证明，在共产党领导下的中国人民解放军面前，并没有攻不破的堡垒。蒋胡匪帮他还误认为我大军打到外线，内线已无力反攻，这不又错了吗？事实证明，我们内线兵力仍然雄厚，不但拉住敌人不让他走，并且要把他消灭在这里，胡匪官兵要想不被歼灭，只有放下武器，不管蒋胡匪想依靠工事火力、增援、抓丁等一切办法，都挽救不了他的兵力不足，士气低落的不治之症。总之，晋南战场正是全国战场的一个缩影，同样的表现出敌人是越打越弱越小，到最后完全被歼灭。我军是越战越强越大，最后完全胜利。发言人谈到我军解放运城安邑的意义时说：在军事上更增强了我军的机动力量，向南可控制陇海路，向西可出关中，并以巩固的晋南，更好的支援豫陕作战。在政治上摧毁了晋南反动势力的老巢，阎匪的三个专著、十六个流亡县政府以及数千恶霸地主斗争对象，被一网打尽，给晋南人民身上搬掉一块大石板，堵塞住一个大“防空洞”，将使正在发展着的土地改革运动，大大推进一步。在经济上，控制了可供晋、豫、陕三省大部地区食盐的潞村盐池，给解放区增加了巨大的财富。这次战役，对我们部队说来，也是一个巨大的锻炼与考验。运城战役说明了我军不但会打运动战，并且会打攻坚战和阵地战，不论土工作业，守阵地和步、炮、工合同动作，都赢得了许多宝贵经验，将奠定我们今后再打更多更大胜仗的基础。谈到这里，发言人以非常乐观的口吻回忆过去说：“去年的现在，蒋胡匪还是想来霸占山西，骑在山西人民头上，寻找他的幸福，所以将家眷等等都搬来了，但是今天困守运城的蒋胡匪，不正是走错了路，而且正好在运城找到了他们的坟墓。”
