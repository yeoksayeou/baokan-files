　　Xingtai Two District Chiefs Go Deep to Employ the Poor
  　Organizing Disaster Victims for Winter Production
    [Report from this newspaper, Xingtai] In the previous period, winter production in Xingtai mostly revolved around middle peasants and some emancipated masses, without penetrating the poor laborers and disaster victims. Since the leadership proposed the issue of deeply mobilizing poor laborers, district cadres were determined to delve deeper and use accounting to identify disaster-stricken households. However, some village cadres, fearing that their villages would lose face, insisted, "We have no disaster-stricken households; everyone has enough to eat." Sometimes, when cadres themselves found disaster-stricken households and calculated their deficits, village cadres would say, "They are too 'backward'; who told them to be afraid to ask for their share during the fruit distribution?" or "They are too wasteful." In addition, some cadres came from poor backgrounds and, being full, did not understand the hunger of the poor and disaster victims, failing to see the honest poor laborers and disaster victims. For example, the head of the armed committee in Fanshang Village was a rich peasant. When district cadres asked him if there were any disaster-stricken households, he said there were none. Due to these obstacles, to deeply engage the poor laborers, it was necessary to bypass the cadres, understand the poor laborers and disaster victims, and then use the specific difficulties of the disaster victims themselves to change the cadres' thinking and solve the problems of the poor laborers. Zhangjia Village relied on poor laborers to find other poor laborers, and the results were accurate and thorough. After Comrade Wang Jingchun, the district chief of the Sixth District, personally investigated, he discovered a household named Xu Changzhi. After his "emancipation," cadres said he was "backward," and the farmers' association expelled him. Since last autumn, his family of three had only one dou of grain per person left. Others disliked his poverty and refused to form a production team with him. After understanding his situation and through accounting and mobilization, District Chief Wang decided to organize the poorest into a group to engage in winter production. After his search, he found six households, a total of eleven people, and organized them to focus on cutting firewood and incidentally collecting manure. Because they had little capital, they opened a small fodder shop, borrowing a temple courtyard as their address. The group members were very enthusiastic. A semi-able-bodied person could cut seventy jin of firewood a day, and the equivalent price was set, making them very motivated. After a period of thorough investigation, each village discovered the difficulties faced by poor laborers and disaster victims in production. District Chief Zhang of the Second District personally lent funds to the poor laborers in Lujiatun, the village with the most poor laborers. According to the conditions of the poor laborers, each village organized production activities such as weaving dustpans, mending shoes, selling tofu, weaving mats, and cutting firewood, and has achieved initial results.

　　邢台两区长深入雇贫
  　组织灾民冬季生产
    【本报邢台讯】邢台冬季生产在上一时期多半在中农和一部分翻身群众的身上打圈子，并没有深入到雇贫和灾民身上。自领导上提出深入发动雇贫问题后，区干部决心往下钻，用算帐来发现受灾户。但有些村干部怕自己村落个面子不好看，硬说：“我们没有灾户，都够吃了。”有时干部自己去找着灾户算出窟窿，村干部会说：“他自己太‘落后’，谁叫他分果实时不敢要？”或“他太浪费。”另外有些干部出身就不好，饱汉子不知饿汉饥，看不见老实雇贫和灾户。如凡上村武委会主任是个富农，区干部问他还有没有灾户，他说没有了。由于有这些障碍，深入雇贫得下决心撇开干部，了解了雇贫灾户后，再用灾户本身具体困难去打通干部思想，去解决雇贫问题。张家庄依靠雇贫找雇贫，结果找的准又找的净。六区区长王景春同志亲自深入后，发现了一户叫许长志的，他“翻身”后，干部说他“落后”，农会便开除了他，他三口人去秋吃到现在，一口人只剩下一斗粮食了，别人嫌他穷，不与他合组生产。王区长了解了他的情况，经过算帐动员，他决心把这最贫的组织起一组，搞起冬季生产，经他一找，找到六户，共十一口人，组织起来，以割柴为主捎带拾粪。因没啥本钱，又开了个小草料铺，借了个庙院当地址。组员劲头都很大，半劳力割柴一天割七十斤，并规定了等价，干的很带劲。经过一个时期的深入，各村都发现了雇贫和灾户生产的困难，二区张区长亲自在雇贫最多村吕家屯亲手贷给雇贫款。各村根据雇贫条件，组织起编簸箕、掌鞋、卖豆腐、编席、打柴等生产，已获得初步成绩。
