From Lingchuan: Since the establishment of the Yutou Village Cooperative in Pingcheng District, Lingchuan, it has been more than four months. Every day, it loudly proclaims "serving the masses," but in its work, it serves the landlords and supports a group of targets of struggle. There are sixteen people in the cooperative, and ten are targets of struggle. Even the traitorous landlords Li Yinlong and Wang Yuanhai, and the rich peasant Wang Hebao (whose two sons are Kuomintang bandit regiment leaders under Ji Zhenkui), have wormed their way into the cooperative, eating and drinking extravagantly. When the masses encounter them, they cover up by saying, "We are saving white flour." The manager, Su Shuizhen, eats at the cooperative, is irresponsible in her work, lives in a good house, and her home is furnished like a landlord's, and she cultivates good land. The accountant, Wang Cuiyu, is an old Kuomintang member from 1925 who supported the enemy and oppressed the masses when the enemy was present. Because the cadres shielded him, he was not thoroughly criticized and struggled against. Now he has a nice flowered quilt, a felt mat, wears glasses, and is fat and well-fed. The masses say, "We carry loads down to Hejian, and we can't even earn a few thousand yuan after a hard winter. People sitting in the cooperative don't have to worry about food and clothing and enjoy happiness." The cooperative's shares were purchased with five hundred silver dollars seized during last year's "cutting the tail of capitalism" campaign, which were exchanged for 300,000 Jibi. Many good pieces of furniture were also placed in the cooperative, not to be distributed to the masses. The village cadres falsely claimed in the name of the district and county committees that the county and district had approved that they could not be divided. When sowing wheat this year, the bank lent Yutou 50,000 yuan to help the masses sow wheat, but the cooperative used it for business, buying fourteen shi of wheat seeds and lending them to the masses with interest. Each dou of wheat had to be repaid with one dou and three sheng of millet, forcing the masses to repay. The cooperative's oil mill buys the masses' hemp seeds at low prices. While millet sells for 1,300 yuan per dou in the market, it can only be sold for 1,000 yuan per dou in the village, forcing the masses to sell. The deputy manager, Wu Wenliang, secretly manipulates things to buy it at a low price for his own family. The deputy manager went to Changzhi to buy cotton ginning machines and to Yincheng to sell hemp for private production. Last autumn, when the masses were about to change seasons, the cadres prohibited the export of rice and cloth. Henan people came to sell cloth, and each dou of rice could buy six chi of cloth, but the cooperative did not allow the masses to buy it. The cooperative bought it all and then sold it to the masses for four chi per dou of rice. During the "cutting the tail of capitalism" campaign last year, nearly a thousand jin of vegetables were confiscated from the autumn land, which were all eaten by the cooperative. The masses are extremely dissatisfied with the cooperative, saying that the cooperative is supporting targets of struggle. The cadres in charge of the cooperative even say, "Hiring poor people who are illiterate and can't do business is useless," and that "the basic masses are not easy to command; they do whatever the targets of struggle tell them to do!" Such cooperative cadres who only serve landlords and ride on the backs of the people should be abolished quickly.

　　冶头村地主钻进合作社
  　统制粮布买卖专为地主发财
    【陵川消息】陵川平城区冶头村合作社成立以来，已近四个月有余，每天高唱“为群众服务”，但工作上都是为地主服务，养活一群斗争对象。合作社里有十六个人，斗争对象就占十个，连奸伪地主李银龙、王原孩，富农王和保（两儿在姬镇魁那里当汉奸团长），也钻进合作社里，大吃大喝，群众碰见了，他们便掩盖说：“我们节省下白面了。”经理苏水珍在合作社吃饭，办事不负责任，住着好房，家里摆的和地主一样，种的是好地。管帐王崔玉是民国十四年的老国民党员，敌人在时维持敌人，欺压群众，因干部包庇，没啦斗透，现在盖的好花被子，铺的毡，戴着眼镜，吃的红白大胖，身不摇臂不动。群众说：“咱担挑下合涧，辛苦一冬也赚不了几千元，人家坐在合作社不愁吃穿享幸福。”合作社里的股金是用去年割尾巴斗出来的五百元银元，兑了冀票三十万元。许多好家具也放到合作社，不让群众分。村干部们私架区委县委名义，说是县区批准不能分。在今年种麦时银行贷给冶头五万元，帮助群众种麦，合作社用了做买卖，买了十四石麦种，借给群众还要生利。每斗麦要一斗三升小米，逼着群众归还。合作社开的油坊贱买群众麻籽。到市上每斗小米是一千三百元，在村只能卖一千元，强迫群众非卖不行，卖给后副经理吴文良从中捣鬼低价买到他家。副经理到长治买了弹花车，又到荫城贩麻作成私人生产。去年秋季群众正要换季时，干部禁止米布出口。河南人上来卖布，每斗米能买六尺布，可是合作社不叫群众买，合作社全部买了，又每斗米四尺卖给群众。在去年割尾巴时斗争出秋地收了将近千余斤菜，全由合作社吃了。群众对合作社极为不满，都说合作社是养活斗争对象。在合作社负责的干部，还说是“雇贫不识字，不会做买卖”，还说是“基本群众不好使唤，斗争对象叫他怎样，他怎样！”象这种专为地主办事骑在人民头上的合作社干部，应该赶快取消。　　（傅芳）
