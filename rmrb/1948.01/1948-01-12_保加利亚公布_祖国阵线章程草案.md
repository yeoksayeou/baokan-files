Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. TASS Sofia: A draft charter establishing the Bulgarian Fatherland Front as a single political organization was recently published here. The draft is to be formally implemented after approval by the Fatherland Front Committee Congress to be held at the beginning of the year. The draft stipulates that the Fatherland Front is a fighting alliance of all anti-fascist, democratic, and progressive forces in Bulgaria. It is a mass social and political pillar representing the people's democratic power, based on the alliance of the working class, working farmers, handicraft workers, and progressive intellectuals. It is a single people's social and political organization based on democratic principles. The tasks of the Fatherland Front are: to fight to eradicate the remnants of domestic fascists and reactionaries; to consolidate the spiritual and political unity of the people; to build the Bulgarian Republic and ensure the freedom, independence, and complete sovereignty of the country; to improve the people's living standards and cultural level; to completely liberate the working people from exploitation; to concentrate the people's strength to realize the program of the people's power; and to establish public supervision over the institutions of the people's power. The draft also stipulates that anyone who recognizes the charter and program of the Fatherland Front and participates in the work of any institution of the Fatherland Front, regardless of party affiliation, nationality, religion, or social status, may be a member of the Fatherland Front. Those who have directly or indirectly served the reactionaries or have been deprived of their civil rights are not allowed to participate in the Fatherland Front. Members of various parties participating in the Fatherland Front must be members of organizations at all levels of the Fatherland Front. Members of trade unions and other mass organizations are also members of the Fatherland Front.

After the draft was published, the parties participating in the Fatherland Front held national congresses to discuss it separately. At the Zveno Alliance Congress at the beginning of the year, the chairman of the alliance, Georgiev, emphasized in his report: "The interests of the Bulgarian people and the nation require the country to resolutely transition to a higher form of social and economic structure. No one should be surprised when we mention socialism. The socialist system is undoubtedly more perfect than the capitalist system, and the future belongs to it." The congress issued a declaration, resolutely obeying the Fatherland Front and fully endorsing the draft charter of the Fatherland Front and the declaration of the nine communist parties. At the end of the congress, Dimitrov attended the meeting amidst thunderous cheers and congratulated the congress on behalf of the Workers' Party, and delivered a speech: "Despite the reactionaries' rumors that the Fatherland Front has become a purely social and political organization, the independence of the various parties has not been abolished and continues to exist, and the Fatherland Front is absorbing new members from the people influenced by the original parties."

　　保加利亚公布
  　祖国阵线章程草案
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社索菲亚讯：确立保加利亚祖国阵线为单一政治组织的章程草案，最近在此间公布。草案要等待年初召开的祖国阵线委员会代表大会批准后，即将正式施行。草案规定：祖国阵线是保国一切反法西斯、民主与进步力量的战斗联盟，它是代表人民大众政权的，具有群众性的社会政治支柱，它以工人阶级、劳动农民、手工业工人与进步知识分子的联盟为基础。它是在民主原则基础之上的单一的人民社会政治团体。祖国阵线的任务在于：为根绝国内法西斯与反动派余孽而奋斗；巩固全国人民精神上与政治上的团结；建设保加利亚共和国，保证国家自由、独立与主权完整；提高人民生活与文化水平；把劳苦大众从剥削中完全解放出来；集中人民力量，实现人民政权的纲领；并确立对人民政权机构的公众监督。草案并规定凡承认祖国阵线的章程与纲领，并参加祖国阵线任何一机构工作得，不分党派、国籍、宗教或社会地位，均得为祖国阵线的成员，至于曾直接间接为反动派服务，或被褫夺公权者，则均不得参加祖国阵线。参加祖国阵线的各党派党员，必须是祖国阵线各级组织的成员，职工会及其他群众团体成员，同时亦均为祖国阵线的成员。
    草案发表后，参加祖国阵线各党派分别召开全国代表大会讨论。在兹维诺联盟年初的大会上，该盟主席乔吉也夫作报告时强调指出：“保国人民与民族的利益，要求国家坚决地过渡到更高形式的社会与经济结构。当我们提起社会主义时，不应该有人吃惊。社会主义制度无疑比资本主义制度更为完美，未来是属于它的。”大会发表宣言，坚决服从祖国阵线，并完全赞同祖国阵线章程草案与九国共产党宣言。大会将终时，季米特洛夫于欢呼雷动中莅会，代表工人党向大会致贺，并发表演说：“尽管反动派造谣说祖国阵线已成为清一色的社会政治组织，但各党派的独立并没有被取消而仍继续存在，祖国阵线正从受原有各党派影响的人民中吸收新分子。”
