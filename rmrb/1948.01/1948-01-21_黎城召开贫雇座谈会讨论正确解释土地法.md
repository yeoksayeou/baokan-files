　　Li Cheng Holds a Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Forum to Discuss the Correct Interpretation of the Land Law

　　[Li Cheng News] Li Cheng held a forum for poor and lower-middle, honest peasants in the county on the 7th of this month to study winter production and the Land Law and to solicit their opinions. First, the leaders mobilized the participants, asking them to boldly expose problems without worrying about repercussions, guaranteeing that "village cadres will not retaliate." After guidance and mobilization, the concerns were broken down. The problems they reflected were: In terms of loans: Shang Huangtang loaned 530,000 yuan, and one landlord borrowed 430,000 yuan. Xi Luotuo loaned 200,000 yuan, which the village chief and the finance director "borrowed" completely. Some village cadres used the excuse that the loans could not be repaid after the due date and refused to lend to poor and hired peasants. In organizing winter production for middle peasants, they looked down on poor and hired peasants. The village chief of ×× reluctantly asked a poor and hired peasant to be the manager of the cooperative, but did not provide specific help. As a result, the manager carried water in the cooperative for one day and couldn't bear it anymore. The poor and hired peasants of ×× village spontaneously organized, but the cadres said, "This is a special agent activity," scaring the masses so they didn't dare to continue. Fifty mu of poor and hired peasant loans, the cadres said were speculation, raising the interest rate, scaring the masses so they didn't dare to borrow. In Chengjiashan, a hundred households opened four tofu workshops, wasting the masses' lives, and the poor and hired peasants did not benefit. The response to the Land Law was: This way, we can completely turn ourselves over. As long as we work hard, we are not afraid of not being able to turn over, and we are not afraid of unequal distribution. As for giving the landlord a share, this is our magnanimity. If he takes out all his things and bows his head to us, then give him a share. When it came to the distribution of fruits last winter, everyone had more opinions. Poor and hired peasants in Shang Guihua said: "In our village last winter, when people saw that it was poor and hired peasants entering to distribute the fruits, they would tell him to take out package number so-and-so, which were all things that our peasants couldn't use." Some reflected: Rich peasants acted as village deputy, not only had no door, but also distributed the fruits. We push the mill without furniture to use, but their home large dustpan, sieve are double sets. After hearing about the Land Law, not only did they not lead production, but they also incited a poor and hired peasant to deliberately borrow more to undermine unity, demanding immediate replacement. Dongguan cadres, because of problems in their own families or having distributed more fruits, even started winter school after hearing about the Land Law, planning for their own problems every day. In addition, some individuals were found to be wasteful. Finally, everyone discussed paying attention to the landlords and rich peasants who were sabotaging and disrupting, preserving the fruits and not allowing the landlords, rich peasants and bad cadres and bad party members to destroy the fruits. For those who want to take advantage in the equal distribution and deliberately waste, everyone's opinion is to explain to him: "If you waste, when it is distributed in the future, your waste will be counted, you will still lose out." Explain to the middle peasants wasting: "Middle and poor peasants are one family, what are you wasting? Those with less land will also be compensated, and those with more land will also mobilize a part to help the poor and hired peasants turn over, and family property will not move, you will still lose out." Resolutely do not allow landlords and rich peasants to destroy the fruits or take advantage of loopholes to distort the Land Law, and whoever destroys them will never be let go. After each poor and hired peasant returned, they immediately convened their own poor and hired peasant groups to collude. Always let the poor and hired peasants understand the Land Law and pay attention to all issues.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Jian Xun)

Editor's Opinion: The Li Cheng leadership convened a meeting of poor and hired peasants to study the Land Law together. If this method is done well, it can provide a mental preparation for the equal distribution of land in the village in the future, and clarify all rumors and distortions about the Land Law. Middle peasants can rest assured, cadres who have gained more fruits can honestly correct their mistakes, and will not violate the Land Law again. If landlords and rich peasants dare to make trouble, there will also be people to monitor them.

However, we believe that it is good enough if this meeting can play the above-mentioned role. The real thorough equal distribution must rely on the mobilization of the entire class of the vast poor and hired peasants in the countryside, and select leaders who are recognized by the peasants themselves from the struggle. Never take the "active element route" of a few people again. We only have one route, that is, the one stipulated by the Land Conference: Relying on poor and hired peasants, rural workers and all landless and land-poor peasants, and consolidating the union of middle peasants. Establish poor peasant groups, peasant associations, and peasant representative conferences to defeat the resistance of landlords and rich peasants. Therefore, the Li Cheng poor and hired peasant meeting should only be a temporary meeting convened to promote the Land Law.

　　黎城召开贫雇座谈会讨论正确解释土地法
    【黎城消息】黎城于本月七日，召开全县贫雇老实农民座谈会，研究冬季生产与土地法，并征求他们的意见。首先领导上做了动员，要求大胆暴露，不要顾虑，保证“村干部不能报复”。经过引导动员，才打破了顾虑。他们反映出的问题有：在贷款方面：上皇堂贷款五十三万元，一个地主就贷了四十三万。西骆驼贷二十万，村长和财政主任两人即“贷”完了。有的村干部借口过期归还不了不借给雇贫。组织中农冬季生产看不起贫雇，××村长勉强叫一个贫雇到合作社当经理，也不具体帮助，结果经理到社内担了一天水，顶不住出来了。××村贫雇自动组织起来，干部却说：“这是特务活动的”，吓的群众也不敢干了。五十亩贫雇贷款，干部说是投机，提高利率，吓的群众也不敢贷了。程家山百户人家，即开了四座豆腐坊，群众生活浪费，贫雇得不到利。对土地法的反映是：这样咱们就能彻底翻透身，只要咱们好好干不怕翻不透，不怕分不公。至于对地主分得一份，这是咱们的宽大。如果他把东西全部拿出来，对我们低了头，就给他分一份。一提到去冬分果实，大家意见就更多了。上桂花贫雇说：“我村去冬分果实，人家一见是贫雇进去分，就说给他拿出第几号包袱来，里边尽是些咱们农民没用的东西。”有的反映：富农当村副，不但没门，还分了果实。咱推磨没有家具使，人家家中大簸箩、簸箕都是双套。听到土地法后不但不领导生产还挑拨一个贫雇故意多贷款来破坏团结，要求马上撤换。东关干部因自家有问题或多分了果实，一听到土地法后连冬学也上起来了，每天为自己问题打算。此外还发现有个别人浪费。最后大家讨论了注意地主、富农破坏捣乱，保存果实不让地主富农与坏干部坏党员破坏果实。对于想在平分中多占便宜便故意浪费的人，大家意见是给他解释：“你如果浪费，将来分的时候，要把你浪费的也算上，你浪费了还是你吃亏。”对中农浪费解释：“中贫农是一家，你浪费什么？地少的还要给你往起补，地多的也是动员一部来帮助贫雇翻身，家财并不动，你浪费了还是你吃亏。”对地主富农坚决不许他们破坏果实或钻空曲解土地法，谁要破坏决不放松。各个贫雇回去后即召开了自己的贫雇小组来串通。总要叫贫雇了解了土地法和注意一切问题。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（建勋）
    编者意见：黎城领导上召集贫雇开会，一块研究土地法，这个办法如果做的好，可以给村里将来平分土地作一个思想准备，把一切有关土地法的谣言和曲解都弄清楚明白。中农可以安心，多得果实的干部可以老实改错，不致再去违犯土地法，地主富农如果敢胡闹，也有人监视他。
    但是，我们认为这个会议能够起了上述作用就算好极了。真正的彻底平分，必须依靠乡村广大贫雇农的整个阶层的发动，从斗争中选拔农民自己公认的领袖。千万不要再走什么少数人的“积极分子路线”。我们的路线只有一个，那就是土地会规定了的：依靠贫雇农、乡村工人及一切无地少地农民，巩固的联合中农。成立贫农团、农会、农代会，来打掉地主富农的反抗。因此，黎城的贫雇会议应该只是一临时的，为了宣传土地法而召开的会议。
