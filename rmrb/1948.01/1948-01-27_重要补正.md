　　Important Correction

　　According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In Public Communique No. 34 of the Su Yu-Wan Front (published on page 2 of this newspaper on the 20th), item E, "killed and captured 74 enemy officers of brigade level or above," should read "84 officers," an increase of 10. They are: Yao Yao, Major General and Deputy Division Commander and Director of the Political Department of the 193rd Division of the 73rd Army; Zhang Zuanliang, Major General and Captain of the 15th Traffic Police Regiment; Chen Chongcheng, Major General and Deputy Captain; Huang Zaixing, Major General and Division Commander of the 4th Division of the 42nd Army Corps; Zhang Runsan, Major General and Director of the Political Department; Song Zanqing, Colonel and Chief of Staff of the 44th Brigade of the Reorganized 26th Division; Zhang Runshi, Colonel and Chief of Staff of the 113th Brigade of the Reorganized 51st Division; Li Xiaolie, Colonel and Director of the Political Department of the 114th Brigade; Luo Xinyuan, Colonel and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Reorganized 72nd Division; Wang Jun, Colonel and Deputy Director of the Political Department of the 15th Division of the 73rd Army. In the same item, Hai Jingqiang and Luo An, identified as the Brigade Commander and Deputy Brigade Commander of the 188th Brigade of the 46th Division, were incorrectly identified as the Brigade Commander and Deputy Brigade Commander of the 118th Brigade. Li Lianxiang, Commander of the Shandong Security Division, was incorrectly identified as Li Lianmu. These corrections are hereby made.
