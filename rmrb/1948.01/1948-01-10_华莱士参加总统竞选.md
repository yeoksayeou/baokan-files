Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: TASS, New York, 1st – Wallace’s speech announcing his agreement to be nominated as a presidential candidate for '48 is a major event in American political life. Wallace has a considerable number of supporters, especially among workers, poor farmers, blacks, and intellectuals. Democratic Party leaders fear that Wallace's move will win the support of millions of voters who consistently supported the Democratic Party during the Roosevelt era but now believe that Truman's platform is little different from the Republican Party's. According to a United Press reporter from Chicago, after Wallace's speech, the Illinois Progressive Party, the California Progressive Party, the CIO Transport Workers Union, Congressman Marcantonio of the American Labor Party, and Barton, chairman of the "National Farmers Union," all expressed welcome and support. Wallace gave a speech in Milwaukee on the 30th, explaining his platform to reporters. Wallace said that the naming of the new party and the vice-presidential candidate would be decided at the national congress to establish the new party. He also said that the congress would likely be held within one or two months. In response to a question about whether he would accept the support of the Communist Party, he said that he welcomed the support of groups willing to support him. Although Democratic Party leaders are trying to explain that Wallace's move will not affect the Democratic Party's strength in future elections, the press acknowledges that Wallace's speech is the most serious blow to Truman's hopes of being re-elected.

　　华莱士参加总统竞选
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社纽约一日电：华莱士宣布他同意被提名为四八年总统候选人的演说，在美国政治生活上是一件大事。华莱士拥有相当数量的支持者，在工人、贫苦农民、黑人和知识分子中，尤其如此。民主党领袖恐惧华氏此举将赢得成百万选民的支持，这些选民在罗斯福时代是一贯支持民主党的，但现在却认为杜鲁门的政纲与共和党极少区别了。据合众社访员自芝加哥报导：华氏演说发表后，伊利诺斯州进步党、加州进步党、产联运输工人工会、美工党众议员马肯托尼奥及“全国农民联盟”主席巴顿等，均表示欢迎与支持。华氏三十日在密尔窝基招待记者中，发表解释其政纲的演说。华氏称：关于新党命名及副总统候选人问题，将在成立新党的全国代表大会决定。并说这个大会极可能在一二月内召开。在答复他是否接受共产党支持的询问时，他说他欢迎愿意支持他的团体的支持。民主党领袖虽亟力解释华氏此举并不影响民主党在将来选举中的力量，但报界承认，华氏演说对于杜鲁门再度当选的希望，是最严重的打击。
