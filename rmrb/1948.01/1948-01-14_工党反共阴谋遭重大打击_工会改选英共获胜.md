Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: London dispatch: The "Anti-Communist Crusade" movement launched by the Labour Party in trade unions has suffered a major blow. According to the Workers' Daily on the 8th, in the anti-communist re-elections within the "Transport and General Workers' Union," the largest union upon which Bevin rose to prominence, communists have actually gained many important positions. Communist Jones has been re-elected as chairman of the London Bus Central Committee (36,000 members) of the union. Jones also won the chairmanship in the re-election of the London No. 1 Passenger Transport Committee (65,000 members). In the re-election of the South Wales Executive Committee of the National Union of Mineworkers, after secret ballot by all pit representatives, the original five communists were re-elected. In resolutions of other trade union branches and workshop representative committees, workers continue to condemn Phillip's anti-communist instigation. White, general secretary of the Civil Service Clerical Association, wrote in the Workers' Daily that Phillip's interference in trade union affairs is an "arrogant absurdity." White stated that the real reason for attacking communists is to eliminate trade union members' dissatisfaction with Labour Party policies and to turn trade unions into reactionary tools of the Labour Party, subordinating workers' economic interests to the interests of the Labour Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Comprehensive report: The advanced section of the British working class has launched another struggle before the New Year to oppose the Labour Party leadership's reactionary policy of attempting to monopolize the labor movement and create unemployment. On December 22nd last year, with the Conservative and Liberal parties cheering in unison, the Labour Party, in the name of its party secretary Phillip, issued an absurd statement to its lower party organizations and trade union bodies, urging an "attack" on the British Communist Party, falsely claiming that the British Communist Party "is hindering the production movement upon which national prosperity depends." In view of the Labour Party's disastrous defeat in the national municipal elections in November last year and the growing dissatisfaction of the British people, especially the workers, with the Labour government, the Labour Party leaders attempted to divert the attention of their party and trade union lower levels through this absurd statement, but were immediately strongly resisted by the advanced section of the British working class. Clackton, member of the General Council of the Scottish Trades Union Congress and officer of the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, said when referring to the Labour Party leaders' anti-communist movement: "I have many friends in the labor movement who are communists. I know they are all comrades who sincerely and enthusiastically wish to work for the benefit of the country, especially to improve the welfare of our poor people. I hope to work with them for this purpose." The Hatton (Northwest London) branch of the Electrical Trades Union passed a resolution rejecting Phillip's call, saying: "We demand that the Labour Party pay more attention to our living conditions and pay more attention to the struggle against the Conservative Party." Upon receiving Phillip's message, the Scottish Bess and other engineering union district committees held a workshop representative meeting and resolved to demand that the executive committee of the National Union of Engineering Workers lodge a strong protest with the Labour Party executive committee. The Clayton local union in Manchester also passed a similar resolution. The resolution of the North London Committee of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, in addition to protesting Phillip's statement, stated: "The reason why communists are elected to leadership positions in various trade unions is because of their fighting spirit and policies that take care of everyone." Before the New Year, the London District Committee of the Electrical Trades Union, representing its more than 60,000 electrical technicians, expressed indignation at the anti-communist speech of the Labour Party's Deakin and passed a resolution stating that the speech was an insult to trade union members. When Horner, General Secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers of Great Britain, delivered a New Year's Eve speech to all trade union members, he asked them to oppose "this despicable work" carried out by Phillip.

In sharp contrast to the anti-communist movement of the Labour Party leadership, some British trade unions have launched another movement demanding that the Labour Party fulfill its promise of "full employment." In an article in the union magazine before the New Year, Richard Coppock, General Secretary of the Building Trades Operatives, severely criticized the Labour government's policy of abandoning large-scale construction plans and creating unemployment. Coppock stated: All the promises that made the Labour Party return to power have now vanished into thin air. The construction industry is in decline, and this is caused by the Labour government, which has sworn to implement a full employment policy. The current policies of the government can only lead to irreparable disaster. Our way forward is to fight against this paralyzing policy of defeatism. The Standing Committee of the Shop Stewards' National Council of the Engineering and Allied Industries has put forward a call, advocating: reduce the British army to 500,000 people, formulate an engineering industry plan, levy a capital tax, and guarantee workers' living standards in order to change the current economic policies of the Labour Party.

　　工党反共阴谋遭重大打击
  　工会改选英共获胜
    【新华社陕北十二日电】伦敦讯：工党在职工会中所发动的“反共十字军”运动，已遭重大打击。据工人日报八日载称：贝文赖以起家的全国最大工会“运输业及各业工人工会”内部的反共改选中，共产党员反而获得了许多重要职位。共产党员宙恩斯已再次当选为该工会所属伦敦公共汽车中央委员会（会员三万六千人）主席。宙恩斯在伦敦第一区客运委员会（会员六万五千人）的改选中，亦荣获主席之职。全国矿联南威尔士执委会的改选中，经一切矿坑代表的秘密投票结果，原来的五位共产党员，仍然再度当选。在其他职工会分会及车间代表委员会的决议中，工人们继续谴责菲力浦的反共挑拨。公务员协会总书记怀特在工人日报著文称：菲力浦之干涉职工事务，乃是“妄自尊大的狂举”。怀特称：攻击共产党人，其真实原因，是要排除职工会员对工党政策的不满，并使工会变成工党的反动工具，使工人的经济利益服从工党利益。
    【新华社陕北七日电】综合报导：英国工人阶级的先进部分，在新年前再次展开斗争，以反对工党领导机关企图包办工运及制造失业的反动政策。去年十二月二十二日，工党在保守党与自由党同声喝采之下，以其党书记菲力浦之名义，向其下层党组织及工会机关发出荒谬声明，促请对英国共产党发动“进攻”，谣言英共“正阻挠全国繁荣所依之生产运动”。鉴于去年十一月全国市选中工党在各地的惨败及英国人民特别是工人对工党政府日益增长的不满情绪，工党领导者企图借此项荒诞声明转移其党内及工会下层的视线，但立即遭到英国工人阶级先进部分的强烈抗击。苏格兰职工委员会总会委员暨建筑工程工会干事克兰肯，在论及工党领导者此项反共运动时称：“我有许多工运朋友，都是共产党员，我知道他们都是同志，诚恳热心地愿望为国家的利益，特别是为提高我国贫苦人民的福利而工作，我希望与他们为此目的而共同工作。”电气工会罕顿（伦敦西北区）分会通过决议，拒绝菲力浦的号召称：“我们要求工党多注意我们的生活状况，多注意与保守党斗争。”苏格兰贝斯等机械工会区委会于接获菲力浦文告后，即举行车间代表会议，决议要求全国机械工人工会执委会向工党执委会提出强烈抗议。曼彻斯特克莱顿地方工会亦通过类似决议。机械工会联合会伦敦北区委会之决议，除抗议菲力浦的声明外，并称：“所以要把共产党人选任各职工会的领导职位，是因为他们的战斗精神与照顾全体的政策。”电器工业工会伦敦区委会于年前代表其六万余电气技师则对工党狄舍斯的反共演说表示愤慨，决议称，此项演说乃是对工会会员的侮辱。英国全国矿工联盟总书记霍尔纳除夕向一切工会会员发表演说时，要求他们反对菲力浦所进行的“这种卑鄙工作”。
    与工党领导机关的反共运动针锋相对，英国若干工会则发动另一运动，要求工党实践“充分就业”的诺言。建筑工人工会联合会总书记范瑟特新年前在工会杂志上撰文，猛烈评击工党政府放弃大规模建设计划并制造失业的政策。范氏称：使得工党重行执政的一切誓言显已形同泡影。建筑工业已在衰退，而这是曾宣誓执行充分就业政策的工党政府所造成的。政府目前的政策仅能招致不可挽救的灾难，我们前进的道路，就是与这种麻痹性的失败主义政策作斗争。英全国工程与附属工业车间代表委员会常委则提出号召，主张：减少英国军队至五十万人，制订工程工业计划，征收资本税，保障工人生活水平，以改变目前工党的经济政策。
