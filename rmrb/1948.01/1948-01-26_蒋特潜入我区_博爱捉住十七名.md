　　Chiang Kai-shek's Special Agents Sneak into Our Area
  　Bo'ai Captures Seventeen

    [Bo'ai News] Recently, the Chiang bandits have been continuously sending special agents to our liberated areas to carry out sabotage and make a desperate struggle. In order to completely crush Chiang Kai-shek's special agent policy, our front-line soldiers and civilians launched a mass capture campaign. The militia, self-defense forces, rotational warfare teams, and troops of various villages in the front were all mobilized. Within ten days, they captured seventeen armed and unarmed special agent bullies sent by the enemy, and seized two guns and four hand grenades. Among them, Li Ao Village captured black gunman Liu Lu and major special agent leader Li Chunxi, which was the best and received commendation from the county headquarters. Following this, Baishan and Qifang also captured several special agents sent by the enemy. In this movement, the leadership promptly encouraged and commended typical models, inspiring everyone's enthusiasm. After Li Ao Village and the Sixth District Rotational Warfare Team were commended, people in the Fourth District, after reading the circular, all said, "We must occupy a page alone" (meaning they must achieve results). On the same day, before dawn, they set off to ambush two miles away from the enemy stronghold, and as a result, captured nine bullies. The morale of other village militia teams was very high, competing to perform meritorious deeds. They also created a lot of experience in methods: finding the enemy's activity patterns and our dead-end areas of activity. Our methods of activity must not allow special agents to find loopholes. The most important thing is to launch a mass capture. When guarding and patrolling in the village, when hearing movements or suspicious places, focus on thorough investigation. For example, in Li Ao Village, they heard dogs barking on the south street of the village at night and knew something was up. At dawn, village cadres and militiamen went to investigate and found black gunman Liu Lu in an uninhabited house. When an eighteen-year-old militiaman Zhao Sanguang saw him, he said, "Old brother, aren't we acquainted?" (meaning they knew each other in the past). Comrade Sanguang shouted, "No, put down your gun, if you don't put it down, I'll hit you with a grenade." With this shout, everyone came together to capture him. One gun and two hand grenades were seized.
    In addition, it is also important to pursue clues after capturing special agents. For example, after Li Ao Village captured Liu Lu, they asked for a confession and learned that Li Chunxi had not left yet. The leadership was determined to capture him, and as a result, they captured him at 7:00 p.m. that same day. (Gao Lei)

　　蒋特潜入我区
  　博爱捉住十七名
    【博爱消息】最近蒋匪不断派出特务到我解放区进行破坏，作垂死挣扎。我前方军民为了彻底摧垮蒋匪的特务政策，展开了群众性的大捕捉运动。前方各村民兵、自卫队、轮战队及部队，都动员起来。在十天内，就捉住由敌方派来的武装和非武装特务恶霸十七名，缴枪两支，手榴弹四个。其中以李凹村活捉黑枪手刘鲁及大特务头子李春喜为最好，得到县指挥部通报表扬。接着柏山、七方也捉住几个由敌方派来的特务。在这个运动中，领导上及时的鼓励与表扬了典型模范，启发起大家的积极性。李凹村与六区轮战队得到表扬后，四区的人看了通报都说：“咱们总得单独占一张”（意思是一定要做出成绩）。在当天天未明就出发到离敌据点二里处伏击，结果捉回恶霸九个。其他各村民兵队情绪都很高涨，争着立功。在方法上也创造了不少经验：找到敌人活动的规律及我方活动之死角地区。我们的活动方法不要让特务找到空子。最重要的是要展开群众性的捕捉。在村中站岗放哨与会哨时，听到动静与可疑地方，就选择重点细致的清查。如在李凹村即是夜里听到村南街狗咬知道有了事情，天一明，村干部与民兵就去清查，结果在一个没有住人的房子内查出黑枪手刘鲁。当一位十八岁的民兵赵三光见到他时，他说：“老弟咱不是别人？”（过去认识的意思）三光同志就大喊：“不行放下枪，不放下手榴弹打你。”这一喊，大家就一齐来把他捉住了。缴枪一支，手榴弹两个。
    另外在捉住特务后，追问线索也很重要。如李凹村捉住刘鲁后，一问口供，知道李春喜还未走了，领导上就下决心捉他，结果在当天下午七时就捉住了。（高雷）
