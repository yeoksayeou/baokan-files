　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: London News: British Communist trade union activists have achieved new victories in the re-election struggles of various trade unions. According to TASS reports: In the recent election of the Electrical Workers' Union, anti-communist elements suffered a crushing defeat, and Communist Party member Stevens was honorably elected as the General Secretary of the union. In the recent meeting of the Federation of Construction Workers' Unions, Communist Party member Ambrose was re-elected as the National Organizing Committee member of the union. As a result of the anti-communist agitation by Labour Party members, Ambrose actually received 14,000 more votes than last time, totaling 49,690 votes.

　　In order to strengthen the current struggle against splitting the trade union movement, the British Communist Party Executive Committee issued a statement on the 13th entitled "Why Are They Attacking the Left?" It stated: The attack on the Communist Party and the left wing is the beginning of the Labour Party authorities' attack on the working people. The Labour Party leaders' anti-Soviet and anti-communist clamor, their "anti-communist crusade" stirred up in the trade union movement, and Cripps's plan all foreshadow that the Labour Party authorities and capitalists will launch an offensive against the living standards of workers this year. In order to defend and improve workers' wages, the British Communist Party once again calls on all socialists and trade union activists to unite and unite to resist all attempts to split the labor movement.

　　英国工会改进中
  　共产党又获新胜利
    【新华社陕北十八日电】伦敦讯：英共职工运动者在各工会改选斗争中，又获新的胜利。据塔斯社报导：电气工人工会最近选举中，反共分子遭到惨败，英共党员斯提文斯荣获该工会总书记之职。建筑工人工会联合会日前会议中，英共党员安姆布罗斯再度当选为该工会全国组织委员。工党分子反共煽动的结果，安姆布罗斯这次所获票数，反而较前次增加了一万四千张，共获四万九千六百九十票。
    为加强目前正在展开的反对分裂职工运动的斗争，英共执委会于十三日，以“为什么他们向左翼进攻？”为题发表声明称：对共产党和左翼的进攻，是工党当局对劳苦工人进攻的开端。工党首脑们的反苏反共叫嚣，他们在职工运动中煽动的“反共十字军”，以及克利浦斯的计划，都预告着工党当局与资本家将在今年转向对工人生活水平发动攻势。为了保卫与提高工人工资，英共兹再度号召一切社会主义者和职工运动者团结和联合起来，以抵抗一切分裂工运的企图。
