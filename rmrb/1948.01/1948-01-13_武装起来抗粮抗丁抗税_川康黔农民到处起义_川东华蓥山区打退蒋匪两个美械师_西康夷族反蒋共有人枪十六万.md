Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. According to consolidated news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: The peasant uprisings and armed forces in Sichuan, Kangding, and Guizhou provinces continue to develop. In Sichuan alone, there are over a hundred large and small units, distributed across a wide area, constantly engaged in fierce battles with the bandit troops under the jurisdiction of Chiang Kai-shek's Chongqing Headquarters throughout the past year. Several peasant armed forces have begun to mobilize the masses and establish unified leadership organizations. The situation of each unit: (1) The largest in scale is the high-quality peasant armed force along the Jialing River in northern Sichuan, in Guangyuan, Wangcang, Nanjiang, and other counties, which has now expanded to Tongjiang, Bazhong, Cangxi on the east bank of the Jialing River, and Pingwu, Jiangyou, Beichuan, Maoxian, and other places west of the Jiange Mountains on the west bank, cooperating with local peasant armed forces, calling on peasants to resist grain requisitioning, conscription, and taxation, and oppose local tyrants, with peasants rising up in large numbers. This unit emerged in the spring of 1946, with its main base in the 600-li long and 300-li wide mountain forest area of Sandaohe in Wangcang, possessing tens of thousands of men and weapons. In addition to rifles and machine guns, they also have heavy artillery and mortars. In August 1946, they defeated four routes of attacks by two regular brigades of Chiang's bandits and local regiments from Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, and completely annihilated the detective brigade of the 15th Administrative District of Sichuan Province. (2) A unit of more than two thousand people on the border of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei is a long-standing peasant armed force. The leader was originally Peng Chunrong, but after Peng's death in battle, Qu Bogai continued to lead, operating in Youyang and Xiushan in Sichuan, and Sangzhi and Yongshun in Hunan, with its base in the Bamian Mountains. In 1946 and 1947, they shattered many attacks by Pan Wenhua's pacification forces of Chiang's bandits. Now this unit has established a political department, posting anti-Chiang slogans at any time, and formulated four combat principles, including breaking up into smaller units to avoid "encirclement and suppression," and consolidating smaller units to eliminate small enemy forces. (3) In the area bordering Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, in counties such as Gusong, Gulan, Pingshan, Qingfu, Changning, Nanxi, Jiang'an, Hongxian, Junlian, Xuyong, Gaoxian, Yibin, Shuchuan, Xingwen, and Weixin in Yunnan, and Bijie in Guizhou, there are more than ten units, totaling more than three thousand people in 1946, which were jointly organized by seventeen leaders such as Yin Lucai, Chen Xianglin, and Zeng Zirong into the "Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou General Headquarters," which developed to more than ten thousand people in 1947. Even Chiang's bandit newspapers reported that in Qingfu, Changning, and Nanxi counties alone, there were 80,000 people. (4) In the Qionglai mountain area of the Emei Mountains in western Sichuan, in Qionglai, Mingshan, Hongya, Pujiang, Emei, Dayi, and other counties, there were only a few small units active in 1946, but in 1947, the Han-Yi peasant armed forces developed to tens of thousands of people, defeating an attack by one regular brigade and two security regiments of Chiang's bandits. (5) In the Minjiang River basin northwest of Chengdu, in Chongqing, Guanxian, Wenchuan, and other counties, there are several peasant armed forces, one of which, with more than a thousand people, has been active for many years, led by figures from secret societies such as Chen Fu'an. In addition to rifles, they have several steel cannons and dozens of machine guns. Last month, the deputy director of Chiang's Sichuan Provincial Security Department led a team to invade, and the battle is about to begin. (6) In Songpan, Lifan, Maoxian, Maogong, and other counties in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River, there are more than 10,000 Han-Yi peasant armed forces led by Ji Xingwu. In 1946, they shattered the "encirclement and suppression" by Chiang's bandits, and in 1947, they inflicted heavy casualties on the invading Chiang's bandits. (7) In the Huarong Mountains of eastern Sichuan, in the seven counties of Linshui, Dianjiang, Yuechi, Wusheng, Hechuan, Jiangbei, and Changshou, there are two or three thousand people in the units of Deng Julin, Wu Weisan, Wu Xianwen, Li Fuqing, and others, using the mountainous area as their base. In the autumn of 1946, they defeated the "suppression" by two divisions of the American-equipped 14th Army of Chiang's bandits. Subsequently, they continued to develop, forcing Chiang's bandits to plan to establish a "Huarong Mountain Suppression Command Post" in Chongqing last winter, attempting to carry out "suppression" again. (8) The remaining units are active in the triangular area between the Daba Mountains and the Yangtze River in northeastern Sichuan, in Wushan, Wuxi, Fengjie, Yunyang, Wanxian, @Du, Changshou, Kaixian, Chengkou, Wanyuan, Daxian, Liangshan, Dazhu, Guang'an, Quxian, and in the area of the Qianjiang River basin in Fuling, Nanchuan, Pengshui, Chongqing, and its nearby Baxian, Bishan, Yongchuan, Jiangjin, Qijiang. In the Jialing River basin in Zhaohua, Nanbu, and Nanchong. In the Fujiang River basin in Anxian, Mianxian, Zhongjiang, Shehong, Pengxi, and Tongnan. In the Tuojiang River basin in Lezhi, Anyue, Dazu, Rongchang, Longchang, Fushun, Neijiang, Zizhong, Ziyang, Jianyang, Shifang, and Mianzhu. In the Minjiang River basin in Pixian, Chongning, Wenjiang, Shuangliu, Huayang, Xinjin, Pengshan, Meishan, Danleng, Renshou, Jiajiang, Jingyan, Leshan, and the counties bordering Sichuan, Kangding, and Yunnan, such as Leibo, Mabian, and Ebian.
