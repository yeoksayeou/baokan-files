　　Land Redistribution Will Thoroughly Liberate Us
  　Nanmazhuang Villagers Enthusiastically Discuss the Land Law
    [Lucheng News] After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the cadres of Nanmazhuang felt that they could not explain and publicize it to the masses, fearing it would affect the masses' production enthusiasm. They only broadcast on the radio station: "Attention everyone, we have good news for you. The Chinese Communist Party has convened a land conference and promulgated the Land Law Outline, which will implement land redistribution, taking from those who have more to supplement those who have less, and taking from the fertile land to supplement the barren land." After this cursory announcement, many people's minds were confused. The government called for the combination of transportation, fertilizer delivery, and discussion of methods, but only talked about it without taking action. After identifying the reasons, first, a forum of poor and hired peasants was held, followed by a village-wide mass meeting the second night (landlords and rich peasants did not participate). The sixteen articles of the Land Law and the editorial in the Xinhua Daily on the 15th were read to everyone, and discussions were launched. Old Han Huanchang said: "Now I know the Land Law is good. The other day I heard on the radio about land redistribution, and I thought it meant putting all the land in one place and redistributing it." Old Han Jiang Zhuhai said: "The Land Law Outline really points the way for us poor and hired peasants, and it makes it clear that middle and poor peasants are one family. We must be careful of the landlords' sabotage." Jinchang said: "I thought it meant taking everything out and distributing it equally, and everyone eating together. Today I learned that it means distributing the landlords' land and property to us, to completely liberate us." Zhang Banglu said: "I think that we should only give the landlords and rich peasants a share after they have been thoroughly struggled against and have bowed their heads." Jin Shuang said: "That's right! Take our village landlords, for example. They used to farm five hectares of land, enjoying themselves and exploiting us. Now they're still better dressed than us, even when they're penniless. That can't be allowed." Yunsuo said: "In the redistribution, give each young person enough land for three people (married with children), and each strong elderly person enough land for two people. This is very considerate of the poor and hired peasants." Jiang Lizhen (Director of Public Security) said: "The Communist Party's policy is truly broad-minded. Even the families of those who work for the Kuomintang will receive the same share as us. This is different from the old society." Old Han Guo Ji Zhi (prosperous middle peasant) said: "The Land Law Outline is really good. My family has four people and farms thirty-five or six mu of land, which is really too much to handle. It's also hard to hire people. I am willing to give up my surplus land." After a heated discussion, the old man smiled and stroked his beard, saying: "Good! This is completely different from what we thought the other day. Now we can rest assured and deliver fertilizer." Finally, it was decided to combine transportation and fertilizer delivery, organize livestock, concentrate their use, with three people driving six animals, working in two shifts to deliver fertilizer. Semi-able-bodied people drive the animals, and able-bodied people carry fertilizer, and women help load the animals. Six hundred loads of fertilizer have now been delivered to the fields. The general wage is three jin of rice per work unit, and four and a half jin of rice per livestock work unit. Small cooperatives, with four people, also allocate two people to carry fertilizer, and two people to sell tofu and cut thatch. The work is now in full swing.

　　平分是为咱们彻底翻身
  　南马庄群众热烈讨论土地法
    【潞城消息】公布出土地法大纲后，南马庄干部认为不能向群众宣传解释，怕影响群众生产情绪，只是在广播台广播说：“大家注意，给你报告个好消息，中国共产党召开土地会议，颁布土地法大纲，要实行土地平分，抽多补少，抽肥补瘦。”囫囵吞枣的播了一下，这样把好多群众思想混乱了。政府号召运输送肥结合，讨论出办法，光说不去作。找出原因后，首先召开干部贫雇座谈会，接着第二夜召开全村群众大会（地主富农未参加），给大家念过土地法十六条及十五日新华日报上社论，展开讨论。焕昌老汉说：“这会我才知道土地法好呀，前两天听广播平分土地哩，我心想是把所有土地，堆在一块来重分一下。”姜注海老汉说：“土地法大纲真是为咱贫雇，更指明中贫农是一家人，咱要注意地主破坏。”进昌说：“我心想是把东西都拿出来平分，大家在一块吃饭，今天我才知道是将地主土地财产平分给咱，叫咱彻底翻身。”张邦路说：“给地主富农分一份，我意见是斗的彻底、低了头后，才给他分。”金双说：对呀！象咱村地主过去人家种五顷地，怎享福怎剥削咱来，现在光溜溜的比咱穿的还好，这样可不行。云锁说：“在平分时青年一人给他分上三个人的土地（结婚生子），壮老年一人分给他两人的土地，照顾贫雇真周到。”姜礼珍（公安主任）说：“共产党政策真是宽宏大量，在国民党那里办事人，其家庭也和咱一样分，可和以前社会不一样。”郭冀只老汉（富裕中农）说：“土地法大纲真好，象我一家四口人，种三十五六亩地，实在种不过来，雇人也不好雇。我情愿将我多余的土地拿出来。”经大家热烈讨论后，老汉摸着胡须笑盈盈的说：“好呀！和咱前两天想的完全不一样，这咱可安心好好送肥吧。”最后讨论，在运输送肥结合下，组织牲口，集中使用，三个人赶六个牲口，倒两班送肥。半劳力赶牲口，全劳力担肥，妇女帮助装驮。现已送到地里六百多担肥，一般的工资每工三斤米，牲口每工四斤半米，小型社共四人，也抽出二人担肥，二人卖豆腐、割白草，现已轰烈的干起来。
