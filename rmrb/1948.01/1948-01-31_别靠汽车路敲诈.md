　　Stop Extorting on the Car Road Editor:
    We, the Xingtai County Government, were transporting goods to Linqing City. Twice we passed through Lyuzhai Village, which belongs to Linqing County, and were fined because our large carts used the car road. The first time was after a rain, when the main road for carts was flooded, and the carters used the car road, so they were caught and fined, which was of course justified. The second time, another carter was transporting relief supplies to Linqing and encountered nine ox carts belonging to the masses in Lyuzhai, with broken axles, so they looked for the car road to use. At that time, a person gathering manure pointed them to the car road. Our cart followed the ox carts onto it (which was, of course, our fault). But the manure collector went back to the village and reported it, and militiamen came and caught them, fining each cart 50,000 yuan. It turned out that the manure collector was the one watching the road. I feel that this isn't road maintenance, but using the road to get rich. According to the villagers near Lyuzhai that the carter asked, it is said that "This village directs people like that and many have been fined, not just you."

　　别靠汽车路敲诈编辑同志：
    我们邢台县府到临清市运东西，两次从临清县属的吕寨村过，都因大车走了汽路被罚了。第一次是雨后，大车路被水淹住，车夫走了汽路，被查住罚了钱，这当然是应该的。第二次另一个车夫到临清运救济物资，到吕寨又遇上九辆群众的牛车，坏了车轴，找汽路走。当时有个拾粪的便指给汽路。我们的车也随牛车上去了（这当然是我们不对）。可是那个拾粪的回村报告了，来了民兵查住，每车罚洋五万。原来拾粪的就是看汽路的。我感觉，这不是看路是靠路发财。据车夫问吕寨附近村群众，据说：“这村那样指引人，受罚的很多了，不是光你们自己”。
