Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Reports from various sources indicate that the Shanghai New Year price surge, triggered by the Chiang government's issuance of 10,000-yuan banknotes, has further eroded public trust in Chiang Kai-shek's currency. Citizens are frantically buying gold and tangible goods, causing prices to skyrocket out of control. On the 8th, gold reached 12.4 million yuan per tael, 24 times the official price of 40 US dollars per tael (equivalent to 480,000 yuan at the official exchange rate). The black market exchange rate for US dollars has soared to a new high of 220,000 yuan, an increase of more than 30% compared to the 5th. The continuous breaking of new records in cotton fabric prices and the intense buying spree have forced the Chiang Kai-shek authorities to order a halt to trading. In addition, Chinese and foreign stocks also rose by 20% to 30%, with eight Chinese company stocks reaching their highest prices in the market within a single day. This price surge began in mid-November before the New Year, and it rose again after the Chiang government announced the issuance of large banknotes on December 10th. The recent appearance of these large banknotes during the New Year period has sparked a third wave of frantic price increases. Over the past month, the Chiang government has arrested merchants in large numbers and implemented financial controls such as suspending loans and remittances, but all have been ineffective. Since the start of the price surge, the black market exchange rate for US dollars has increased by one and a half times, and the price of rice has increased by more than 66%. According to Reuters, Chiang Kai-shek's Minister of Finance, Yu Hung-chun, has resigned due to his inability to overcome the continued deterioration of Chiang Kai-shek's economic situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek, prices in Qingdao are soaring, and there is a severe food shortage. In late December, the price of rice reached 1.2 million yuan (Chiang Kai-shek currency) per dan (unit of weight), millet 1 million yuan per dan, and even the pancakes eaten by coolies cost 10,200 yuan per jin (unit of weight). The people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult. A rickshaw puller's daily earnings of 18,000 yuan are not enough to buy two jin of pancakes, let alone support a family. Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the 4th Security Column stationed in Qingdao are also not getting enough to eat, receiving only one and a half jin of dark, coarse flour per day. They have written phrases such as "Can't get enough to eat, running home," and "Hungry, join the Eighth Route Army" all over the walls of the latrines. In order to collect grain to supply the Chiang Kai-shek troops, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities are openly seizing grain from the people, ordering all merchants and residents in the city to surrender all but three bags of flour and 100 jin of millet per person. Factories in Qingdao are closing down one after another due to insufficient raw materials and high prices. For example, the Da Zhong Tobacco Factory, the Dongzhen North China Tobacco Company, and the North China Alcohol Factory have all closed, resulting in the unemployment of thousands of workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: As the Lunar New Year approaches, prices in Yantai City, occupied by Chiang Kai-shek, are soaring. The market price of gold has exceeded 12 million yuan (Chiang Kai-shek currency) per tael, an increase of two times compared to when Chiang Kai-shek invaded Yantai in early October, and 24 times higher than the official price of 480,000 yuan per tael. Daily necessities have also risen sharply. "Battleship" and "Sycee" brand flour has risen to 3 million yuan per bag. Fine cotton cloth has risen to 14 million yuan per bolt. The Chiang Kai-shek authorities are unable to stop the soaring prices but are instead cruelly exploiting the citizens. In addition to the existing more than ten kinds of exorbitant taxes such as "gun tax" and "banquet tax," they have added a "well water tax" of 1,000 yuan per person per month and a "toilet tax" of 400 yuan. They are also forcing people to buy "national salvation bonds." The Xiu Zhong Clock Shop on Nandadao was forced to close after being forced to pay more than 2 million yuan. Primary schools are also targets of Chiang Kai-shek's extortion. Fuleli Primary School was extorted 1 million yuan, Nanshan Road Primary School was extorted 700,000 yuan, and other primary schools such as "Pengcheng" and "Zhenhua" were also extorted tens of thousands of yuan. Under these high prices and heavy taxes, people's lives have been greatly threatened. Recently, sanitation workers throughout the city went on strike to demand higher wages. Currently, there are more than 600,000 jin of accumulated feces in the city, and the stench is everywhere. The citizens are constantly cursing Chiang Kai-shek.

　　上海青岛物价猛涨
  　老百姓说：“肚子饿，投八路”
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据各方报导：由于蒋政府新年发行十万大钞所引起的上海新年涨风，广大市民更不信任蒋匪货币，纷纷抢购黄金实物，致物价有如脱僵之马。八日黄金每两已达一千二百四十万元，为官价每两四十元美金（按官价汇率折蒋币四十八万元）的二十四倍。美钞黑市汇价已猛涨至二十二万元之新高峰，较五日上涨百分之三十以上。棉织物价格的不断突破新纪录与炽烈的抢购浪潮，已迫使蒋匪当局下令停止交易。此外中外股票也上涨百分之二十至三十，中国公司八种股票市场于一日之内均达到最高价格。此次涨风开始于年前十一月中旬，至十二月十日蒋政府宣布发行大钞后会再度上涨，而最近新年期中由于大钞之出现市场，又掀起第三度的狂涨。在这一个多月中，蒋政府曾大批逮捕商人，实行停止放款及汇兑等项金融管制措施，但均归无效。自涨风开始至现在，美钞黑市汇价上涨一倍半，大米价格上涨百分之六十六以上。据路透社透露，蒋匪财政部长俞鸿钧已因无法克服蒋匪经济情况之继续恶化，提出辞职。
    【新华社陕北十日电】蒋匪统治下的青岛，物价狂涨，粮荒严重。十二月下旬大米每担价格已涨达一百二十万元（蒋币）小米每担一百万元，苦力所吃的煎饼，每斤也要一万零二百元。人民生活日趋艰难，人力车夫一天流汗所得一万八千元，买不到二斤煎饼，更谈不上养家。蒋匪驻青岛保安第四纵队士兵亦吃不饱饭，每天仅发一斤半黑粗面。他们在厕所墙上写满了：“吃不饱，向家跑”，“肚了饿，投八路”等字句。蒋匪当局为搜集粮食供给蒋匪军，竟向民间公开抢粮，下令全市商民住户，除每人可留三袋面粉及一百斤小米外，其余全部没收。青市工厂在原料不足物价高涨下纷纷停工，如大中烟厂、东镇华北烟草公司、华北酒精厂等均先后关门，数千工人因而失业。
    【新华社陕北六日电】旧历年关将至，蒋匪侵占下的烟台市物价猛涨。黄金每两市价已突破一千二百万元（蒋币），较十月初蒋匪侵入烟市时增涨两倍，较官价每两四十八万元已高出二十四倍。日用必需品也随之猛涨不已。兵船牌及元宝牌面粉每袋已涨至三百万元。花细布每匹涨至一千四百万元。蒋匪当局无力制止物价狂涨，却更残酷压榨市民。现除已有之“枪支”“筵席”等十几种苛捐外，又增添“井水捐”每人每月一千元，“厕所捐”四百元。并强迫购买“救国公债”，南大道修钟店即被强征二百多万而被迫停业。小学校也是蒋匪勒索对象，福乐里小学被勒索百万元，南山路小学被勒索七十万元，其他“彭城”、“振华”等小学亦均被勒索数十万元不等。在此高物价与横征暴敛下，人民生活已遭受极大威胁。日前全市卫生工人为要求增加工资全体罢工，现市内粪便堆积约有六十万斤以上，到处臭气冲天，市民皆咒骂蒋匪不绝。
