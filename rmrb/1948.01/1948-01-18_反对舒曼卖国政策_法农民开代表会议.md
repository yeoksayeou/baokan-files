Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Paris dispatch: The struggle of the French people against Schuman's treasonous policy of accepting the Marshall Plan to enslave France is actively underway. According to a TASS dispatch on the 14th: Initiated by the French Communist Party's organizations in five provinces, a farmers' representative meeting was held in Paris. At the meeting, farmer representatives criticized the "Franco-American Bilateral Agreement" signed on the 2nd, and opposed Schuman's treasonous policy and increased taxation. In his closing remarks, French Communist Party leader Marty pointed out: Schuman is attacking farmers today, just as he attacked the working class yesterday. Marty emphasized that Schuman's policy is to cater to American capitalists, destroy French agriculture, and strangle French industry. Meetings and demonstrations of the same nature have also taken place in other cities. A TASS dispatch on the 12th stated that a large demonstration of veterans was held in Lyon. When French Communist Party Secretary Duclos addressed the demonstrators, he called on them to oppose the Marshall Plan and the Mayer Plan (i.e., the new tax law). Representatives of aircraft industry workers in the Paris region also held a meeting on the 9th to protest the Schuman government's work slowdown in the nationalized aircraft industry under the instruction of the United States. It is said that in the past four months, the aircraft industry has not received a single order, and the government's debt of 9 billion francs has not been paid at all. The textile industry in important industrial areas of northern France, such as Lille, Roubaix, and Tourcoing, is facing the danger of closing down due to American obstruction and the arson by thugs of De Gaulle's "Union" in various places to destroy stored cotton. Therefore, 200,000 local textile workers are preparing for a new struggle to oppose the Franco-American reactionaries' conspiracy to destroy French industry.

　　反对舒曼卖国政策
  　法农民开代表会议
    【新华社陕北十六日电】巴黎讯：法国人民反对舒曼卖国政策吸马歇尔奴役法国计划的斗争，正积极进行中。据塔斯社十四日电：由于法共五个省组织的发起，巴黎曾召集农民代表会议。会议上农民代表们纷纷抨击二日签订的“法美双边协定”，反对舒曼卖国政策与加重捐税。在闭幕词中法共领袖之一马尔梯指出：舒曼今日打击农民，正如它昨日打击工人阶级一样。马尔梯着重称：舒曼的政策，就是逢迎美国资本家、毁灭法国农业，并绞杀法国工业。同样性质的会议及示威亦在其他城市中进行。塔斯社十二日电称：里昂曾举行退伍军人大示威。法共书记杜克洛向示威者演说时，号召示威者反对马歇尔计划及迈耶计划（即新税收法）。巴黎区飞机工业工人代表于九日亦召开会议，抗议舒曼政府在美国授意下，对国有化的飞机工业怠工。据称：在过去四个月内，飞机工业没有得到一张订单，而政府所欠的九十亿法郎也未付分文。法国北部重要工业区如里尔、鲁贝和都尔科音的纺织工业，由于美国的阻碍及戴高乐“联盟”的流氓在各地放火烧毁存棉的结果，正面临关厂的危险，因此当地廿万纺织工人正准备新的斗争，以反对法美反动派毁灭法国工业的阴谋。
