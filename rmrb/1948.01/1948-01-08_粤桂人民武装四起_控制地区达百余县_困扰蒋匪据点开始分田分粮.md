Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: According to consolidated Shanghai press reports: In the past year, the people's armed forces in Guangdong Province have achieved great development, with the number of personnel increasing from more than 20,000 to over 70,000, and the area of activity expanding from more than 30 counties to more than 60 counties, accounting for more than half of the total number of counties in the province. In some areas, the situation has been formed where the people's armed forces control the countryside, surrounding Chiang Kai-shek's isolated strongholds, and land distribution movements have begun. Their distribution can be roughly divided into six regions:

(1) Southern Route: The area stretching from the border between Vietnam, Guangdong, and Guangxi in the west to Yangchunjiang, eight hundred miles to the east, is entirely under the control of the people's armed forces. The people's armed forces have two columns, each with three divisions. The base area of one column is in the area of Hepu, Lingshan, Qin County, and Fangcheng in the Shiwandashan (Ten Thousand Great Mountains) area, and has now expanded to more than 30,000 people. In May and June of last year, the uprising of more than 1,000 farmers led by Liu Zhenxia joined, and since then the momentum has grown and the development has accelerated. This unit revolted in Guangpo and Fusha towns in Fangcheng County, captured Dongxing in one fell swoop, opened granaries to relieve the poor, and promoted opposition to the "three requisitions" (referring to "conscription," "grain requisition," and "real property requisition"). This column has now occupied all the rural areas and towns of the above counties. Many students from large and medium-sized schools from far and near have joined this unit. Another column is led by Zhang Shichong, with its base in the plains of the Leizhou Peninsula, echoing the People's Liberation Army of Hainan Island across the water, and connected by land with the people's armed forces of He, Heng, and other counties in the Gouluo Mountains of Guangxi and the Liu Zhenxia's unit in Shiwandashan in the northwest. By the end of October, the strength of this column had grown to nearly 10,000, and it possessed a large number of water and land transport brigades composed of ships and mules and horses, traveling between the base areas. At present, the entire peninsula, from Xu Kai County on the opposite shore of Hainan Island in the south to Lianjiang in the north and Huazhou and Wuchuan in the east, except for the county towns and nine townships, has been liberated or controlled by the people's armed forces, and Xuwen County has also been liberated; Maoming, Dianbai, Yangchun, and Yangjiang in the east have become guerrilla areas. A large number of educated youths have also joined this unit. The local masses actively help their own army, serving as guides in battles against Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, launching surprise attacks against the enemy, causing Chiang Kai-shek's newspapers to lament: "The authorities' troubles are not only due to insufficient troops, but also because the common people have all been 'banditized'." At present, the only Chiang Kai-shek's bandits opposing the tens of thousands of people's armed forces in the Southern Route are the two regiments of the police and security team led by Chen Pei, the director of the provincial police and security department. Since Chen established the so-called "Guangdong-Guangxi Southern District Bandit Suppression Command" on October 10, he has always wandered around Maoming and Xinyi, daring not to move forward.

(2) The People's Liberation Army of Hainan Island has now occupied three-quarters of the island, liberating 2.5 million people. In addition to occupying villages and towns and the county towns of Baisha, Ledong, and Baoting, it has recently captured the county town of Anding and the northeastern seaport of Qinglan Port. Under the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops are shrinking in Qiongzhou, daring not to come out. Chiang Kai-shek has recently reinforced two security corps, but the number of people is less than 2,000, attempting to struggle desperately.

(3) The "Gan-Yue-Xiang Border Region Headquarters," based in Dayuling, leads a division of the "People's Liberation Army Northern Route Column," operating in Nanxiong, Shixing, Renhua, Lechang, Wengyuan, Longnan (Jiangxi), Xinfeng and surrounding areas. In Nanxiong County alone, there are more than 1,000 people. The villages in each county are controlled by the people's armed forces. Six people's district governments and several township governments have been established in Nanxiong, and the masses have been mobilized to carry out land and grain distribution movements. Military-civilian cooperation has been widely carried out to harass Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. Nanxiong and Shixing, the hometown of Zhang Fakui, the former director of Chiang Kai-shek's Guangzhou headquarters, have been isolated from the outside world and become isolated islands. On November 18, the people's armed forces destroyed the Dakengkou railway bridge between Yingde and Qujiang on the American-aided Chiang Kai-shek supply line, the Yuehan Railway, and cut off the military transportation on the Beijiang River north of Yingde, while protecting merchant ships and implementing trade management to protect industry and commerce.

(4) In the East River area, the people's armed forces have recently mobilized armed peasants everywhere in Haifeng, Lufeng, Huiyang, Zijin, Boluo, and the five counties north of them, Wuhua, Longchuan, Heyuan, Longmen, and Conghua. On October 26, more than 300 people from the people's armed forces attacked the Jiang bandits' checkpoints at Luofang, Muhu, and Yangguling, at the border between Hong Kong and Guangdong, killing and wounding 10 enemies, capturing 1 machine gun and 5 rifles, and distributing the 67 slogans issued by the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army on Double Ten Day and other leaflets. On October 18, they also destroyed the Chiang bandits' Guihai ship, forcing the Hong Kong-Guangzhou shipping line to stop for a while. In addition, a part of the people's armed forces is also active in the Pearl River Delta.

(5) The people's armed forces in the Guangdong-Fujian-Jiangxi border area, led by Luo Guanquiao and Lai Fuyuan, have more than 2,000 people in the "Guangdong-Fujian-Jiangxi Border Area People's Volunteer Corps," and more than 1,000 people in the Liang Ren and Zhang Naixin's unit, operating in Raoping, Dabu, Jiaoling, Pingyuan, Meixian, Heping, and Wuping in Fujian Province, and Xunwu in Jiangxi Province. Liang and Zhang's units have repeatedly defeated Chiang Kai-shek's bandit "suppression" troops and captured towns such as Guantang, Xintang, and Tiancun. On October 21, they also attacked the county town of Dabu.

(6) The people's armed forces in the West River area include the "People's Volunteer Army" Gao Yao You, Deng Wu unit, the "Democratic Allied Army" Feng Chao, Chen Zhonggao unit and Xie Guanghan unit, totaling more than 2,000 people, operating in Kaiping, Guangning and other counties.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: According to consolidated Chiang Kai-shek-controlled area newspaper reports: By the end of last year, the people's armed forces in Guangxi had expanded to 39 counties and mobilized and organized peasants and attacked county towns everywhere. The Democratic Alliance Revolutionary Army in the Rongjiang River basin in the southwest, including Rong County, Teng County, Beiliu, and Lingxi, has established the "Democratic Allied Army Independent 10th Division," led by Huang Shixian and Li Da. This unit revolted in March of last year, when it attacked Rong County and once occupied Teng County, creating the "Teng Rong Incident" that shocked the enemy. It has now joined forces with Zhang Shichong's column of the people's armed forces in the Leizhou Peninsula of Guangdong, with the Gouluo Mountains as its base area. In Luchuan, Bobai, Yulin and other counties, a part of the people's armed forces led by Zou Zheng has established the "Huabei Military Region Headquarters" and once attacked Yulin County. The unit led by Mo Fanfan in Guixian, Hengxian and Yongchun in the Yujiang River Basin is particularly strong. The one who attacked Guixian and Hengxian a month ago was the unit. At present, all the villages and towns in the area have been controlled by this unit. On both sides of the Lijiang River at the northern foot of Shiwandashan, Nanning, Funan, Shangsi, Suilu, Chongshan, Sile, Yangli, Longming and other counties, Huang Puhuang unit of the Twenty-first Independent Battalion dispatched by Liu Zhenxia's column of the people's armed forces of Southern Guangdong mobilized the masses in various places. By the end of last year, it had expanded the armed forces by more than 400 people and possessed weapons such as machine guns and submachine guns in addition to rifles. A new base has now been established in the Phoenix Township in Shangsi County. In addition, a part of the former officers' team headed by Chen Gaohe also organized and armed peasants in the area. In Longjin County in the upper reaches of the Lijiang River, there is a part of the people's armed forces with more than 1,000 people who once cut off the highway from Nanning to Longjin. On the upper reaches of the Xijiang River and the Pangiang River (i.e. the Qianjiang River), in Baise, Tianyang, Fengshan, Donglan, Wangang, Pingzhi and other counties, there are several people's armed forces, one of which once occupied Wangang County. In Duan and Shanglin counties, a part of the armed peasants led by Luo proposed the slogan of "Opposing Bad Politics". In Liujiang, Qianjiang, Binyang, Wuming and other counties, there are more than 1,000 people's armed forces (originally reported by Chiang Kai-shek's newspapers as five or six hundred) from the "Peasant Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force" established during the Anti-Japanese War and those who gathered at @Lunkuan in the winter of 1946 to revolt against conscription. In Wuxuan County, a part of the people once attacked the county seat in November. The "Democratic Allied Army" appeared in Xiang County and @山区. The people's armed forces in Quanzhou, Xing'an, Guanyang, Gongcheng, Fuchuan and Hexian, which are adjacent to Xiang Province, have established the "Guangdong Eastern Liberated Area", with its base in Dupangling, Mengzhuling and Lingheling. There are organizations such as trade unions, peasant associations and women's federations in the mountains. At present, the people's armed forces in Guangxi have shaken the entire province, and the Chiang bandits in the province only have four security corps with a total of more than 4,000 people, so they are scrambling around in a mess. Huang Xuchu, the chairman of the Chiang bandits' provincial government, replaced the county heads of Quanzhou, Rong and other six counties at once in October last year.

　　粤桂人民武装四起
    控制地区达百余县
    困扰蒋匪据点开始分田分粮
    群众积极帮助军队大批知识青年参军 
    占领海南岛四分之三解放人民二百五十万
    东江发动武装农民我军口号到处传播
    确掌农村进袭城市建立联军创根据地
    【新华社陕北二日电】综合沪报讯：去年一年，粤省人民武装获得伟大发展，人数由二万余人发展达七万以上，活动地区由三十余县扩展至六十余县，占全省县数的大半；若干地区已形成人民武装控制的农村包围蒋匪孤立据点的形势；并开始了分田运动。其分布约分六区：
    （一）南路：西起越南、粤、桂边境，东达阳春江八百余里的地区，全在人民武装控制之下。人民武装有两个纵队，每纵队三个师；一个纵队的根据地在十万大山地区之合浦、灵山、钦县、防城一带，现已扩充至三万余人。该部于去年五、六月间，由于刘镇夏率领之千余农民起义参加，自此声势愈大，发展愈速。该部起义于防城县属光坡、付沙二镇，一举攻占东兴，开仓济贫，宣传反对三征（指“征兵”、“征粮”、“征实”）。该纵队现已占领上述各县之全部农村及市镇。远近大、中学生参加该部者甚多。另一纵队由张世充领导，根据地在雷州半岛平原地带，南与海南岛人民解放军隔水呼应，西北与桂境勾漏山贺、横等县人民武装及十万大山刘镇夏部陆路相接。该纵队兵力截至十月底为止，已发展近万，并拥有大批舰船骡马所组成之水陆运输大队，来往各根据地之间。现整个半岛南起海南岛对岸的徐开县，北达廉江，东至化县吴川，除各县城及九个乡外，全为人民武装所解放或控制，徐闻县城亦已解放了；东面之茂名、电白、阳春、阳江则已成为游击区。该部也有大量知识青年参加。当地群众积极帮助自己的军队，在与蒋匪作战中，充任向导，出奇袭敌，使蒋匪报纸亦哀鸣：“当局之苦恼，不仅兵力不足，而且老百姓均已‘匪化’。”现与南路数万人民武装敌对之蒋匪只有该省保警处长陈沛所率之警保队两个团，陈匪自十月十日建立所谓“粤桂南区剿匪指挥部”以来，始终徘徊于茂名、信宜一带，不敢前进。
    （二）海南岛人民解放军现已占领该岛四分之三，解放人民二百五十万。除占领村镇及白沙、乐东、保亭三县城外，近又攻占安定县城及东北海港清澜港。在人民解放军之强大攻势下，蒋匪部队龟缩琼州不敢出犯。蒋匪近增援两个保安总队，但人数不满二千，企图负隅挣扎。
    （三）北路以大庾岭为根据地之“赣粤湘边区司令部”，率有“人民解放军北路纵队”一个师，活动于南雄、始兴、仁化、乐昌、翁源、龙南（赣境）、新丰一带，仅南雄一县，即有千余人。各县乡村均为人民武装控制，南雄已建立六个人民区政府及若干乡政府，并发动群众进行分田分粮运动。军民合作广泛展开困扰蒋匪的工作。南雄与蒋匪前广州行辕主任张发奎之家乡始兴，已和外界隔绝而成孤岛。十一月十八日人民武装破坏了美国援蒋补给线粤汉铁路英德、曲江间大坑口铁桥，并截断英德以北的北江水上的军运，一面保护商航及实行保护工商业的贸易管理。
    （四）东江地区人民武装，近于海丰、陆丰、惠阳、紫金、博罗及以北之五华、龙川、河源、龙门、从化等县到处发动武装农民。十月廿六日，人民武装三百余人进攻港粤交界处罗坊、木湖、杨古岭三处将匪关卡，毙伤敌十人，缴获机枪一挺、步枪五枝，并散发人民解放军总部双十节颁布之六十七条口号及其他传单。十月十八日并炸毁蒋匪桂海轮，迫使港穗航运一度停顿。此外，珠江三角洲亦有人民武装一部活动。
    （五）粤闽赣边区人民武装，有罗观桥、赖福元率领之“粤闽赣边区民众义勇队”二千余人，及梁饪、张乃馨部一千余人，活动于饶平、大埔、蕉岭、平远、梅县、和平及闽境武平，赣境寻邬等县，梁、张部曾屡创蒋匪“清剿”部队，攻克官塘、新塘、田村等市镇。十月二十一日，并曾进攻大埔县城。
    （六）西江地区人民武装，有“人民义勇军”高要有、邓伍部，“民主联军”冯超、陈中高部及谢光汉部共二千余人，活动于开平、广宁等县。
    【新华社陕北五日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：广西人民武装去年年底已扩展至三十九县，并到处发动与组织农民及进袭县城。西南部容江流域容县，藤县、北流、岭溪等县的民主联盟革命军已成立“民主联军独立第十师”，由黄世宪、李达领导，该部系于去年三月起义，当时曾攻入容县城，并一度占领藤县城，造成震惊敌胆的“藤容事件”。现已与广东雷州半岛的人民武装张世充纵队会合，以勾漏山区为根据地。陆川、博白、郁林等县有邹正领导之人民武装一部，已成立“化北军区司令部”，曾一度进攻郁林县城。郁江流域贵县、横县及永淳的莫平凡部，实力尤为雄厚，月前攻入贵、横二县城者即为该部。现该地区全部村镇，已为该部控制。十万大山北麓丽江两岸，南宁、扶南、上思、绥渌、崇善、思乐、养利、龙茗等县，有广东南路人民武装刘镇夏纵队派出之第二十一独立营黄埔煌部在各地发动群众，截至去年底止，已扩大了武装部队四百余人，除步枪外，拥有机枪、冲锋枪等武器。现已在上思县境凤凰乡一带建立新根据地。另有以陈高和为首包括旧军官总队队员之一部，亦在该地区组织与武装农民。丽江上游龙津县境有人民武装一部一千余，曾一度截断南宁通龙津的公路。西洋江流域及盘江（即黔江）上游沿岸的百色、田阳、凤山、东兰、万冈、平治等县，有人民武装数部，一部曾一度攻占万冈县城。都安、上林两县有罗某领导之武装农民一部，提出“反对坏政”口号。柳江、迁江、宾阳、武鸣等县有抗战中建立的“农民抗日自卫队”及四六年冬间为反抗抓丁而奔聚＠仑关起义的人民武装一千余（原据蒋区报纸报导为五六百）。武宣县境一部，十一月间曾一度攻入该县县城。象县及＠山区有“民主联军”出现。毗连湘境之全县、兴安、灌阳、恭城、富川、贺县的人民武装则已成立“桂东解放区”，其根据地为都庞岭、萌渚岭及临贺岭，在山地里有工会、农会、妇女会等组织。现广西人民武装已震荡全省，而该省蒋匪兵力只有四个保安总队，共四千余人因而手忙脚乱，该省蒋匪省主席黄旭初，于去年十月一次即撤换全、容等六县县长。
