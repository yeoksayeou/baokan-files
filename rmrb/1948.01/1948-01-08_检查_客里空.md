Reader's Letters

　　Checking "Kelikong" Comrade Editor:
    In the news "Changzhi Summarizes One Year of Production Experience" published on page two on the 29th of last month, there is a section about the Changzhi Xinhua Paper Mill "transforming tools, saving 4,500 labor days, increasing production by one time...", according to comrades familiar with the factory's situation: this news does not conform to the facts. In the past, the factory used livestock to pull the raw materials for grinding. In June, it was changed to using electricity. The speed was increased. One electric mill (including the electricity used for the beater) can top the production volume of twelve livestock, but the electricity cost is equal to the consumption of twenty-four livestock. That is to say: after the tools were transformed (from animal power to electricity), the cost of power for grinding raw materials was more than double the cost of using livestock, greatly affecting the cost of paper. Therefore, the factory is recently planning to abandon electricity and still use livestock. This is the true situation of "tool transformation". As for the matter of "saving 4,500 labor days", I don't know what it is based on? Regarding the issue of "increasing production by one time", it is understood that the factory was small last year, with four pools, and this year it has been expanded to ten. The number of pools has increased, and the number of workers has also increased. Of course, the output will also increase, but this can only be said that the factory has expanded, and it cannot be said that production has increased. The factory's output is relatively low compared to general paper mills. For example, the standard daily output per worker in Zhangyuan Paper Mill is six districts of double-sided printing paper, and the actual output can be seven districts. The standard volume of a large paper mill, People's Paper Mill, is five districts, and the actual output exceeds this number. However, the standard output of this factory is only four to four and a half districts, which is much lower than others. In terms of quality, it is also far behind others. However, the wages of the factory's workers are higher than the wages of any other paper mill. (Reader Zheng Yan, Fu Hong) This manuscript was submitted by the Taihang Branch.

　　检查“客里空”编者同志：
    上月二十九日第二版载“长治总结一年生产经验”的消息，内有关于长治新华纸厂“改造工具，省工四千五百个，增产一倍……”等一段。据熟悉该厂情况的同志谈：这段消息不符合事实。该厂以前碾原料用牲口拉，六月间改用电力，在速度上是增加了，一盘电碾（打料机用的电亦算在内）可顶十二头牲口的生产量，但所用的电费，却等于二十四头牲口的消耗。就是说：改造了工具后（由畜力改电力）在碾原料的动力上，较用牲口的费用贵了一倍，大大的影响纸的成本。因之，该厂近又计划不用电力仍用畜力了。这是“改造工具”的真实情况。所谓“省工四千五百个”一事，不知根据何在？所谓“增产一倍”的问题，据了解，该厂去年规模小，有四个池子，今年扩充为十个。池子增加了，工人也增加了，当然产量也要增加，但这只能说是工厂扩大了，不能说是增产。该厂在产量上，与一般纸厂比起来，是相当低的。例如漳源纸厂每个工人每天的标准产量，是双印纸六区，实际上能出七区。一大纸厂，人民纸厂的标准量均为五区，实际产量均超出此数。但该厂的标准产量只有四区至四区半，比人家低的多，在质量上说，亦远落后于人家。而该厂工人的工资，却比任何纸厂的工资都高。（读者正言、傅宏）此稿是太行分社来稿，请作检查。　　　　　——编者
