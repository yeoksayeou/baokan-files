　　通讯往来
  　第四号
    各分社，各地通讯员同志，我们有如下要求供你们参考：
    一、学习毛主席报告、中国土地法大纲（包括本区补充条例）及其它重要文件的情况，经验，各种问题（我们当负责解答）以及宣传土地法的经验和贫雇、中农、村干、工商业者听了土地法后的具体反映。
    二、有那些破坏土地法的行为？是否制止了？如何制止的？
    三、各地土地会议中各种不同出身干部的典型反省。
    四、冬季生产有些啥成绩？领导上是不是充分满足贫雇要求，同时又巩固的团结中农进行生产？贫雇仍有何困难？中农利益有无被损害现象？
    五、要求通讯员为雇贫及农民们代笔，写下他们的知心话、呼声、要求，他们有些什么不满意，不敢说的话，有什么大的冤枉事？都可写来，我们今后专辟农民呼声栏发表。写稿的态度，建议参考第三号通讯往来的精神，发扬优点，揭露与批评缺点，不要片面，不要夸大，有啥说啥，实事求是。
    六、阴历年关的准备及过年情形。
