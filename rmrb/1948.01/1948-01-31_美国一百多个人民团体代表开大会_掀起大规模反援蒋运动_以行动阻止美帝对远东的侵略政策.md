　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 29th: New York dispatch: The American people have launched a large-scale just movement against the US government's aid to Chiang Kai-shek for aggression against China and against the US's entire policy of aggression and expansion in the Far East. The National Conference on American Policy toward China and the Far East, initiated by the American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy for this purpose, was held in New York from the 23rd to the 25th. Attendees included representatives from 107 American organizations, including 30 trade unions affiliated with the CIO and AFL, representatives from several independent unions and many other organizations, as well as PM publisher Field, Dr. Wen Youzhang (a Canadian), former professor at West China University, renowned journalist Ms. Strong, and Far East expert Ge Si, among others. Former US Congressman DeLacy served as the organizer of the conference. One of the chairmen of the conference was Bi Sheng, a well-known American expert on Far Eastern affairs and former special advisor to MacArthur. Mr. Brisson, Chairman of the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union, elaborated in his opening speech that the purpose of the union was to plan actions to stop the US government's assistance to Chiang Kai-shek and the reactionary forces in the Netherlands, France, and Korea, and to formulate progressive Asian policies to counter the US government's policy of aggression and expansion in the Far East. Brisson emphasized: "Our (referring to the American people) response to the war crisis must be embargoes, sending delegations to Congress to petition, and other more active measures." In his speech, DeLacy advocated that dockworkers and ship workers organize pickets to prevent ships carrying military supplies from sailing to China. At a mass meeting before the conference, Ms. Strong, based on her personal observations in China, severely condemned the US government for aiding Chiang Kai-shek in slaughtering the Chinese people with airplanes and artillery.

　　The meeting passed a resolution demanding that the United States adopt democratic policies towards China, Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, and India, and formulated an action program to stop the transportation of weapons, munitions, and other aid to Chiang Kai-shek and the Dutch and French aggressors in Indonesia and Vietnam. It also demanded that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea, allowing the Korean people to decide their form of government without foreign interference, to purge former pro-Japanese elements and traitors from the South Korean (US-controlled area) government, police, and other public institutions, and to immediately dissolve all terrorist organizations.

　　During the conference, congratulatory telegrams were received from various democratic and progressive organizations and individuals in the United States. Representatives of the Philippine People's Liberation Army and representatives of the Chinese Liberated Areas attending the Prague World Federation of Trade Unions also sent telegrams of congratulations. The US Communist Party organ, the Daily Worker, warmly praised the conference, and pointed out that the American reactionaries are planning to interfere in China in new and more intense ways, and the conference must formulate a progressive Asian policy to deal with the current challenges from the American reactionaries.
