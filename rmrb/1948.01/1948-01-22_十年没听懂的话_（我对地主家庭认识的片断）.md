　　Words I Didn't Understand for Ten Years
　　(Fragments of My Understanding of Landlord Families)
　　Gē Mǎ

　　Ten years ago, I decided to go to Yan'an. Before I left, my father told me something. He said:
　　"If you really want to go, then go. Even if we go back twenty years, I'll go with you. I think your older brother will go too... However, don't believe the Communist Party's 'pamphlet' propaganda too much. When you get there, they might keep you outside the door, keep you out for a while. At that time, don't be distressed, pessimistic, or even commit suicide. Write to me, and I'll send money to get you back."
　　At the time, hearing these words, I hardened my heart, lowered my head, and didn't even dare to look at his face. I always felt like something was weighing on my heart, like I was very sorry for him. This impression was very deep. After joining the revolution, when chatting with comrades about my family situation, I often liked to talk about this passage. Everyone who heard it said my father was very enlightened, and naturally I was very happy. So I would list his history: he had joined the Tongmenghui, served as a brigade commander during Li Yuanhong's presidency, and served as a Kuomintang member of parliament during Yuan Shikai's era, participating in parliamentary struggles, and so on. Therefore, I was sure that my father had political vision and was not reactionary. And I thought my father understood me, cared about me, and planned too thoroughly for me. And I was confident that I understood my father very well.
　　Since the land reform study, deeply investigating my thoughts, I traced the root of my serious personal heroic achievement-seeking thought to my father. Therefore, my father appeared before me as a small warlord and a large landlord with two thousand mu of land. So, I felt that my father's words were worth considering. So, I thought of my brother's letter when I was studying at Lu Xun Academy of Art in Yan'an, which said: "Father finds it strange that you went to Yan'an with great difficulty, but instead of studying politics, you started studying art?..." So, I also feel strange now, does my father, such a warlord and big landlord, still want me to study politics to serve the people? No, I discovered his political intentions. He was hoping that I would be a "official" in the Communist Party in their eyes. According to his "Xinhai Revolution" style of thinking, this "official" could make foreign wealth. At least when the revolution gains power and the Communist Party gains power, he can still "borrow light" for some "insurance". So, I suddenly realized his words today. He knew that I had to leave, so he might as well be "generous" and "enlightened". The meaning of his previous words was to have me "register" them in my mind. Don't forget them, leave them an opportunity to "invest"; of course, they will not come. The latter part of his words was his last "anti-communist" propaganda to me, to carry out a "political disintegration", secretly tying a rope to me, hoping that if I "run into a wall", I would still go back to be his good landlord son.
　　So, does my brother also have political intentions for me? Yes, when I left him, he was still a propaganda officer in the Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang Central Committee in Nanjing. In the two days before I left, he said to his friends in front of me: "I sent my younger brother to the Communist Party to 'preserve' him..." Of course, I was not sent by him. But what did he want to "preserve" me for? Did he really want to "preserve" me to be a long-term worker for the people? Obviously not. He and my father similarly hid a secret and unspeakable words. So, did I also register them in my mind? Yes, and very firmly. Last year, when I met comrades from the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army and chatted, I thought of getting my father a job in the government. I thought his old brand of the Xinhai Revolution could still be used. When Comrade ×× came back from the front and told me in a chat that he might be sent to Nanjing to participate in the CCP delegation, I also thought that my brother must have returned to Nanjing, and I could use his relationship to do some work for our Party. But God knows, if a person like me without a class stand really went, I don't know who would use whom. I joined the revolution in 1938 and also joined the Communist Party. I thought I was politically advanced, smart and capable, but my father and brother's simple words, after ten years and land reform studies, I finally understood. Where did my self-proclaimed cleverness and talent go? How foolish are people without a class stand?
　　What attitude should be taken towards a family like mine? Here, I am also forced to recall a story that my father repeatedly told me:
　　In the twentieth year of the Republic of China, when the Yangtze River flooded, my father, wanting to make a fortune, planted lotus seeds on two thousand mu of land and lived in the countryside. One afternoon, my father, seeing that the water was rising too high, called his tenant Liu Jinwang and said: "I see that the water is too high today, so let's use my boat to send your ninety-year-old grandmother to the mountain. The elderly are important. After you send her away, quickly drive the boat back to pick me up." Liu Jinwang drove the boat away, sent his grandmother, and moved his own furniture, and never came back. In the evening, the moon came out, dimly. The Yangtze River dike collapsed, and the flood immediately rushed into my father's house. My father had to take his last concubine and stand on the square table, pressing some things on the table. The water slowly rose, reaching his chest. At this time, the concubine covered her face and cried, but my father seemed to say with great emotion: "What are you crying about? Haven't we done enough evil in our lives? It's good to die and feed the fish in the flood, how clean." Here, my father seemed to want to die so "heroically" and "generously", but in the moment of crisis, an old fisherman who often brought fish to my father came in a boat. He saw the lights in my father's house and saved his life again.
　　In the past, I was always moved and even cried when I heard this story. I thought my father was too bitter, and the peasant Liu Jinwang was "selfish" and let him down. Even this time in the three investigations, I still couldn't understand my father's intention in telling this story. I always thought that no matter how bad my father was, he was always a person. Could it be that a person is not as important as those furniture? Why didn't Liu Jinwang save my father and move his furniture? But today, thinking about it again: Why did my father ask Liu Jinwang to send his old grandmother? Is it really for so-called "respect for the elderly" and "humanitarianism"? No, he asked Liu Jinwang to send his grandmother for his own sake. When the flood came, he, the big landlord, was unable to escape. He wanted to give some small favors to buy off Liu Jinwang in order to escape. But the peasant Liu Jinwang had already seen through this. Who is selfish? My father, with his concubine, exploiting them, living an extremely corrupt life, had long let down the peasants and had long been hated by the peasants. Then, taking this opportunity, shouldn't Liu Jinwang "let him down"? In the eyes of the peasant Liu Jinwang, my father was far less important than their furniture. Their furniture, after being cleaned up, could still be used for labor and production, but what use was my father other than exploiting people? Why shouldn't the peasants move his production furniture and save my father, the bloodsucker, when the flood was rolling and in a very urgent situation? Understanding this also makes me understand my father's intention in telling the story. He was educating me to hate the peasants and to be a filial son to his "humanitarian" and "righteous" landlord father. Today, from this story, I also understand my father's sins. He exploited and treated the peasants too harshly, otherwise, the loyal peasant Liu Jinwang would not have failed to save his life. Then, understanding this, I also clearly affirmed my attitude towards my family. The peasant Liu Jinwang, who was distorted by my father, was right. The peasant Liu Jinwang educated me, and I must firmly stand on this side.
　　This story is even earlier, it happened nineteen years ago, and I was so stupid that I didn't understand it until ten years after the revolution. I am willing to write it down, with the extremely indignant mood of a deceived person, and offer it to comrades who were born in alien classes and have not yet understood their words.

　　十年没听懂的话
    （我对地主家庭认识的片断）
    戈马
    十年以前，我决定要到延安去了。临行时，我父亲给我讲了一段话。他说：
    “你实在要去了就去吧，再转回去二十年我也陪你一块去。我看将来你哥哥也要去的………不过，你也不要太相信共产党的‘小册子’宣传了。你到了那里，他们可能把你关在门外头，关一个时期。那时候你不要苦恼，悲观失望，甚至于自杀，你写信给我，我再寄钱把你弄回来。”
    当时听了这一段话，我是硬着心肠，低着头，连他的脸色都不敢看一下，总觉得心里压着一个什么东西，很对不起他似的。这印象留的很深，参加革命以后，和同志们闲谈起家里的情形来，我也常爱谈这一段话。大家听了都说我父亲很开明，我自然也很高兴，于是乎还要例举出他的历史来，他曾参加过同盟会，当过黎元洪总统时代的旅长，当过袁世凯时代国民党的议员，参加议会斗争等等。于是，我肯定我父亲是有政治眼光的，不反动的。并且以为我父亲就是理解我，关心我，为我打算得太周到了。而我也自信我非常理解我的父亲。
    土地改革学习以来，深入查思想，查了我严重的个人英雄成名思想的根源，便查到了我父亲那里。于是，我父亲便以小军阀和拥有二千亩土地的大地主面貌，出现在我的面前了。于是，我觉得我父亲的那段话，颇值得考虑了。于是，我想到了我在延安鲁艺学习时，我哥哥来信说：“父亲很奇怪你，为什么千辛万苦跑到延安，不学政治学起艺术来了呢？………”于是，我现在也感到奇怪了，难道我那样一个军阀兼大地主的父亲，还要我为人民服务而学政治吗？不是的，我发现他的政治企图了，他是在希望着我在共产党里，做一个他们眼中的“官”。这个“官”，按照他那“辛亥革命”式的想法来看，是有洋财可发的。至少当革命得势，共产党得势的时候，他还可以“借光”一下来一个“保险”。于是，他那一段话，我今天才恍然领悟了，他是明知道我非走不可了，不妨“大方”“开明”一些的。他那前一段话的意思就是要我思想上给他们“挂个号”。不要忘掉他们，给他们留个可“投”的机；他们当然是不会来的。后一段话则是他对我最后一次的“反共”宣传，要来一个“政治瓦解”，给我暗暗的拴条绳子，盼望着我万一“碰壁”的话，依旧回去做他的好地主儿子。
    那么，我哥哥是否对我也有政治企图呢？也有的，我离开他时，他还是南京国民党中央宣传部的宣传干事，临我要走的那两天，他曾当着我的面向他的朋友说：“我把我弟弟送到共产党那里‘保存’起来。……”我当然不是他送来的。但是，他想把我“保存”起来干什么呢？难道他真要把我“保存”起来为人民当长工吗？显然不是的，他和我父亲同样暗藏了一种密而不可告人的话。那么，我是否思想上也为他们挂了号呢？挂了的，而且挂得很牢。去年当我碰到新四军五师的同志闲谈起来的时候，我曾想到把我的父亲弄到政府里工作，我认为他那块辛亥革命的老牌子，还可以用一用。当××同志从前方回来，闲谈中告我他可能派到南京参加中共代表团时，我又曾想到我哥哥一定回南京了，我还可以利用他的关系，为我党做些工作。但是，天晓得，象我这样一个没有阶级立场的人，真要是去了，还不知道是谁利用谁呢？我三八年参加革命，也参加共产党了，自己以为政治上是进步的，聪明能干的，而我父亲和哥哥那样简单几句话，经过十年之久，土地改革学习以后，我才算是听懂了，我那种自命不凡的聪明才智哪里去了呢？没有阶级立场的人是何等的愚劣啊。
    对我这样的家庭应采取什么态度呢？这里也迫使我想起我父亲曾再三告我的一个故事：
    民国二十年，长江大水暴涨时，我父亲因想发洋财，把二千亩田都种上了莲子，住在乡下。一天下午，我父亲看着水势涨得太大了，叫来他的佃户刘金旺说：“我看今天水势太大，还是用我的船把你那九十岁的老奶奶送上山吧，老年人要当紧些。你送走了赶快把船驾回来接我。”刘金旺把船驾走了，送了他的祖母，又搬他自己的家具去了，一直没回来。傍晚，月亮出来了，昏昏的。长江的大堤倒了，大水立刻冲到了我父亲住的房子里，我父亲只好带着他最后的一个姨太太站到方桌上，在桌子上压了些东西。水慢慢涨起来，一直涌到他的胸口了，这时候，那位姨太太掩面哭泣了，我父亲却似乎很感慨的说：“你哭什么呢？我们这一辈子作的孽还少了吗，死了，大水里喂鱼多好，多干净。”这里，我父亲似乎是要死得多么“豪气”“慷慨”的了，但正在危急之时，一个经常给我父亲送鱼来的老渔户驾着船来了，他看见了我父亲家里的灯光，又救了他一命。
    往年听了这段故事，总为我父亲感动，甚至流泪，以为我父亲太苦，农民刘金旺“自私自利”对不起他，甚至此次在三查中，我也还不能了解我父亲讲这故事的用意，总以为我父亲再不好，总是个人，难道人还不如那些家具重要吗？为什么刘金旺不救我父亲而搬他的家具去了呢？但今天转过来一想：我父亲为什么要刘金旺送他的老祖母呢？真是为了所谓“敬老”“人道主义”吗？不是的，他叫刘金旺去送他奶奶，正是为了他自己，大水来了，他这个大地主是无能逃脱的，他想施点小惠收买刘金旺以求得逃命。但农民刘金旺早看穿了这一套了，究竟是谁自私自利呢？我父亲带着姨太太，剥削着他们，过着极为腐化的生活，早很对不起农民，早已为农民恨之入骨了。那末趁着这个机会，刘金旺不应该“对不起”他一下吗？在农民刘金旺的眼里，我父亲远不如他们的家具重要，他的家具收拾起来，还可以再劳动生产，而我父亲除了剥削人以外，还有什么用处呢？为什么当着大水滚滚万分紧急的时候，农民不该搬他的生产家具，而要救我父亲那个吸血虫呢？明白了这个，也明白了我父亲讲故事的企图了。他是在教育我仇恨农民，叫我为他那个“人道”而“正义”的地主父亲做个孝顺儿子。今天从这个故事里，我也明白了我父亲的罪恶，他剥削苛打农民是太厉害了，不然，那个忠实的农民刘金旺不会不救他一命的。那末，明白了这，我也明确的肯定了我对我家庭的态度。被我父亲歪曲了的农民刘金旺是对的，农民刘金旺把我教育过来了，我要坚决站在这一边。
    这故事更早，是十九年前的事了，而我愚笨得迟至革命后十年才理解。我愿写下来，以被愚弄者极为愤慨的心情，供献给出身于异己阶级，而尚未听懂他们的话的同志。
