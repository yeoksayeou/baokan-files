Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 24th: TASS, Chicago reports: The Second National Congress of the "Progressive Citizens of America" was solemnly held in Chicago on the 18th and closed on the 19th in an atmosphere of enthusiasm and fighting spirit. The congress resolved to promote the establishment of a new American party, condemned the reactionary domestic and foreign policies of the United States, and urged the US authorities to immediately cease interference in China and Greece. The resolution stated: "In the next ten months, the main task of the 'Progressive Citizens of America' is to unite all Wallace-supporting groups and individuals to realize the establishment of a new party led by Wallace and strive to include Wallace on the presidential candidate lists in various states. This association will also participate in the national congress of the new party on April 12th." The resolution condemned: "The big bosses of US monopoly capital use the Democratic and Republican parties as tools, gorging themselves on huge profits while making the people extremely impoverished. They are plotting against the freedom of independent nations, using hunger and suffering as weapons of conquest, and dispatching troops to carry out shameful expansion." The resolution denounced the US government's policy towards China, demanding that the US government "cancel all aid to the feudal military clique of China (Chiang Kai-shek) and support the Chinese people's desire for a democratic government." The resolution cried out: "We oppose the Marshall Plan by which monopoly capital controls the European economy, but we propose to replace the Marshall Plan with a genuine plan to revive Europe (the Wallace Plan)." In addition, in terms of foreign policy, the resolution also opposed US military and economic expansion in Latin America and support for the reactionary Spanish government's participation in the United Nations. Regarding racial issues, the resolution called for striving for the independence of Puerto Rico and eliminating discrimination against black people. Regarding domestic affairs, the resolution urged: "To fight against monopoly capital and strive to improve the living standards of the people and expand democratic rights." It suggested: "Stop inflation, and nationalize the steel industry, coal mines, and railways," demanding: "Immediately abolish anti-labor laws, the House Un-American Activities Committee, and all laws restricting democratic rights." The resolution concluded: "We believe that lasting democracy and a prosperous peace can still be achieved. We present our program to all Americans who desire this peace to fight together." The congress also elected former California Attorney General Kenny as the new chairman of the association, Yale University Professor Emerson as secretary, and the vice-chairmen included "Progressive Citizens of America" leader Baldwin, former Minnesota Governor Thorson, black singer Robeson, and American Slavic Congress Chairman Kroyk.
