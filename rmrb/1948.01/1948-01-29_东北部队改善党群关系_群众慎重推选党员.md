Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th: A certain battalion of the People's Liberation Army "Lanzhou" unit has universally launched a movement for the masses to review Party members and recommend Party member candidates. The 8th Company of this unit first launched this movement in early August of last year, and it has already achieved results. This time, in the process of establishing the Party Committee, it was extended to every company. At the celebration meeting jointly held by Party members and the masses to celebrate the establishment of the Party Committee, the spirit of democracy was fully promoted. Many problems between the Party and the masses were examined and resolved, greatly improving the relationship between the Party and the masses. The Party's prestige among the masses has been raised to an unprecedented level. Many non-Party soldiers have a new understanding of the Party, feel that being a Communist Party member is the most glorious thing, and express their determination to be able to join the Party. One liberated soldier said at the meeting: "In the Kuomintang, even a second-class private cannot raise an opinion about a first-class private. Here, opinions can be expressed to Communist Party members and cadres. It's really unbelievable." Old soldier Zhang Shichun also said: "In the past, my thinking was backward, and I thought it didn't matter whether or not you were in the Party, but now I understand the Party." At the meeting, the masses criticized certain Party members and cadres with a sincere attitude, and the Party members and cadres also humbly accepted the opinions of the masses and conducted self-criticism. Squad Leader Han Zhenjiang (a Party member) said in his self-criticism: "I have violated mass discipline and my leadership over everyone has not been good. I am very sorry to everyone. This criticism is very helpful to me." He asked everyone to help him more in the future. The masses showed an extremely cautious attitude when recommending Party member candidates. For example, in the 8th Company, four candidates for Party membership were recommended by the masses at the meeting. During the evaluation, three were approved by the masses. When discussing Sui Lin, soldier Yang Yiming said: "Sui Lin is brave in battle, but he has a bad temper and doesn't care enough about the masses. My opinion is to talk about it after he corrects these shortcomings." Based on the opinions of the masses, the branch committee accepted three people for Party membership and decided to continue to cultivate and educate Sui Lin. Sui Lin also said: "These shortcomings should be corrected. I will join the Party after they are corrected." In total, more than 30 new Party members were accepted in this unit through mass evaluation. A wave of enthusiasm for joining the Party has been set off in the army, and people have successively made plans to join the Party and plans to earn merit to join the Party. Now the army is full of a new atmosphere of unity and joy.

　　东北部队改善党群关系
  　群众慎重推选党员
    【新华社东北二十六日电】人民解放军“兰州”部某大队普遍展开群众审查党员和推选党员对象运动。该部八连首于去年八月初发动，已著成绩。此次在建立党委会过程中，即推广到每个连队，在党员与群众联合举行的庆祝党委会成立大会上，充分发扬了民主精神，检讨与解决了党与群众中很多问题，大大改善了党与群众的关系。党在群众中的威信空前提高，许多非党战士对党有了新认识，感觉到做一个共产党员是最光荣的，并表示决心做到能够入党。有一个解放战士在大会上说：“国民党那边二等兵对一等兵有意见也不能提，在这里对共产党员、干部有意见都能讲，真是想不到的事”。老战士张士纯也说：“我过去思想落后，认为党不党没有什么关系，这回认识党了”。大会上群众以诚恳的态度批评了某些党员和干部，党员和干部也虚心的接受了群众的意见，进行自我检讨。班长韩振江（党员）检讨说：“我犯过群众纪律，对大家的领导不好，很对不起大家，这样批评对我帮助很大”。要求大家以后多帮助他。群众在推选党员对象时表现了极其慎重的态度，如八连在会上经群众推选了四个入党对象，评议时有三个得到群众批准通过。讨论到隋林时，战士杨以明说：“隋林打仗勇敢是行，可是脾气不好，对群众关心不够，我的意见是改正这些缺点以后再说”。支委根据群众意见，接受三名入党，对隋林则决定继续培养与教育。隋林也说：“这些缺点都应该改，改了以后再入党”。总计该部通过群众评议，接受了三十多名新党员。在部队中掀起了要求入党的热潮，纷纷订出入党计划和立功入党计划。现部队中，充满着团结愉快的新气象。
