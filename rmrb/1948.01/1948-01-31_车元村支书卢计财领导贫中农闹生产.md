　　【Licheng News】Lu Jicai, the Party branch secretary of Cheyuan Village in the Fifth District of Licheng, organized hired and poor peasants and united with middle peasants. On December 29th, they went to Shangwu Township to transport coal for the factory. Lu Jicai himself drove a mule and also drove a donkey for someone else, carrying 50 jin himself. He carried and transported a total of 270 jin. Under his influence, no one walked empty-handed. In addition to driving their own donkeys, they also drove livestock for others, and tried their best to carry 40 to 50 jin. A total of 10 hired and poor peasants and 5 middle peasants were organized. Twelve people drove 20 livestock, and three people carried loads, transporting a total of 3,200 jin of coal. The transportation fee was 21 yuan per jin, earning 67,300 yuan in silver. The round trip took three days, and they were frugal, staying in stores and not eating noodles when lighting a fire. After deducting expenses of 3,150 yuan, the actual remaining amount was 64,050 yuan. The masses reflected, "The Communist Party is always thinking of the poor and suffering people!"

　　车元村支书卢计财领导贫中农闹生产
    【黎城消息】黎城五区车元村支部书记卢计财，组织雇贫，团结中农，于十二月二十九日上武乡给工厂驮炭。卢计财自己赶骡一头，并给别人捎赶一个驴，自己还背上五十斤。连背带驮二百七十斤。在他影响下，没有一人空走。除了赶自己的驴，又给别人赶牲口。还尽力背上四、五十斤。计组织雇贫十人，中农五人。十二人赶牲口廿头，三人担挑，共运炭三千二百斤。每斤脚钱二十一元，赚洋六万七千三百元。往返三天，省吃俭用，住店起火不吃面。除盘费三千一百五十元，实剩六万四千零五十元。群众反映说：“共产党处处是为贫苦老百姓着想呀！”
