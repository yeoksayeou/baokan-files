*True Pravda Commentary*

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. Moscow dispatch: The international commentator of *Pravda* revealed on the 18th that the Marshall Plan is heading towards collapse, stating: "The diplomatic frenzy and haste of the United States are mainly due to economic difficulties and the continued deterioration of domestic struggles in the United States." Under these circumstances, the "Frankfurt Agreement" is an attempt to create a *fait accompli* to force the US Congress to approve the appropriation for the Marshall Plan. The commentator then revealed the recent speeches by Attlee and Morrison, stating: "They exposed the loyalty of the British and American bourgeoisie to the Marshall Plan, and the willingness of Western European socialists to serve American imperialism and act as anti-Soviet and anti-communist tools." The commentator concluded forcefully: "The Marshall Plan is heading towards collapse, and along with it will collapse the unprecedented adventurous group of right-wing socialists and American imperialism."

　　马歇尔计划正走向崩溃
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】莫斯科讯：真理报国际评论家于十八日揭露马歇尔计划正走向崩溃称：美国外交上的狂热和急急忙忙，主要是由于经济困难和美国国内斗争的继续恶化。在这种情形下，“佛兰克福协定”便是企图造成即成事实，以迫使美国会批准实现马歇尔计划的拨款。评论家继揭露艾德礼与莫里逊最近演说称：他们暴露了英美资产阶级忠实于马歇尔计划以及西欧社会党人表示愿为美帝国主义效力并充当反苏、反共的工具。评论家结语力称：马歇尔计划正走向崩溃，而和它一起崩溃的，将是右翼社会党和美帝国主义的空前冒险集团。
