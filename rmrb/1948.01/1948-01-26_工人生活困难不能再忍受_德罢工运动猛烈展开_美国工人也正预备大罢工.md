　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Berlin dispatch: The anti-hunger movement in the British and American occupied zones of Germany is escalating. In Cologne (British zone), a major industrial city in Germany, 120,000 workers announced a 24-hour general strike on the 21st. The steel, hardware, chemical, and construction industries have all fallen silent, and government offices and most shops have closed one after another. Strikes in many cities in the Ruhr area are continuing. Two thousand construction workers in Essen went on strike on the 20th. The factory trade union committees of Bochum and Gelsenkirchen decided that if the food problem is not resolved before February 1st, they will announce a strike by Ruhr miners. All employees in the British occupied zone have also announced a general strike, demanding an increase in rations. In the American occupied zone, 70,000 workers in Nuremberg held a strike to protest the serious food situation. 50,000 striking workers participated in demonstrations and held a general meeting. In Bibra, 9,000 workers went on strike. More than 2,000 workers in Wiesbaden-Bubach went on strike, protesting the halving of fat rations. The chairman of the trade union in Gavel (southern part of the American occupied zone) stated that the area faces the threat of a strike by 65,000 workers, and a slight touch could create a situation like that in the Ruhr. Barker, the trade union leader of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, recently issued a warning stating: "If the hungry food situation is not improved, a new wave of strikes in the Ruhr can be foreseen soon. If the crisis deepens, it is expected that hungry people will begin to attack farms, food, and bakeries." German democratic newspapers such as Deutsche Nachrichten pointed out: The serious difficulties of the working class in the US-British joint occupation zone have reached an unbearable limit. Terms such as "food disaster" are no longer suitable to describe the current situation. The current strikes in the joint occupation zone are a powerful expression of anti-hunger and self-defense.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Washington dispatch: Due to high prices and difficult living conditions, the United States is brewing a wage increase and general strike movement. The Railroad Operating Engineers Union, with 125,000 members, is scheduled to begin a strike on February 1st. The United Auto Workers Union of the CIO, with 800,000 members, has notified employers of its wage increase demands, and 233,000 telephone workers will also make wage increase demands. Also, six thousand workers at the American "Equatorial Petroleum Company" in Colombia have been on strike for many days. The workers unanimously oppose the dismissal of workers and demand wage increases.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Lima, Peru dispatch: The American Federation of Labor (AFL)'s attempt to sabotage the progressive Latin American Labor Federation led by Toledano by convening the so-called "Pan-American Labor Conference" has been exposed and has failed. The chairman of the Mexican Local Labor League, Morones, spoke at the conference, accusing the purpose of the AFL's convening of the conference as serving American monopoly capital, and angrily withdrew from the meeting. Many Latin American labor organizations and well-known major newspapers have resolutely attacked the "conference" and ignored its activities. In a letter to the Peruvian Minister of Labor, the chairman of the AFL also lamented that "the failure of the conference may make the AFL a laughingstock."

  　德罢工运动猛烈展开
  　美国工人也正预备大罢工
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】柏林讯：德境英美占领区反饥饿运动更趋高涨。德国大工业城市科隆（英占区）十二万工人于二十一日宣布二十四小时总罢工，钢铁、五金、化学和建筑各业均已寂然无声，市府机关和绝大多数店铺相继关门。鲁尔区很多城市的罢工仍在继续。埃森二千名建筑工人于二十日进行罢工。巴木及该尔孙基亨的工厂工会委员会，决定如粮食问题在二月一日前不能解决，将宣布鲁尔矿工罢工。英占区所有职员亦已宣布总罢工，要求增加配给量。在美占区，努连堡七万工人举行罢工，反对严重的粮食情况。五万罢工工人参加示威并开大会，拜布拉赫有九千名工人罢工。威斯巴登——布巴黑二千余工人罢工，抗议脂肪配给量减少一半。加维尔市（美占区南）工会主席称：该地面临六万五千工人罢工之威胁，只要轻轻触一下，就会造成象鲁尔那样的情况。德北莱茵威斯特发利亚州的职工会领袖巴克勒，顷发出警告称：“如果饥饿的粮食情况不加以改善的话，不久，可以预见鲁尔新罢工的浪潮。假如危机加深的话，可以预料饥饿的人群将开始进攻农场、食品及面包店。”德国民主报纸德意志新闻等指出：美英联合占领区工人阶级的严重困难，已到了不能忍受的限度。象粮食灾难这样的名词，已不再适于形容目前的情况了。目前联合占领区所进行的罢工，是反饥饿及实行自卫的有力表示。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】华盛顿讯：由于物价高涨，生活困难，美国正酝酿增资与大罢工运动。拥有十二万五千会员的铁道机务工人工会，定于二月一日开始罢工。拥有八十万会员的产联汽车工人联合会，已将增资要求通知各雇主，二十三万三千电话工人亦将提出增资要求。又讯：美国在哥伦比亚的“赤道石油公司”六千工人，已罢工多日，工人一致反对解雇工人并要求增资。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】秘鲁首都里马讯：美国劳联于日前召开所谓“泛美劳工会议”，以破坏托列达诺所领导的进步的拉丁美洲劳工联盟的企图，已被戳穿则告失败。墨西哥地方劳工联盟主席莫洛尼斯在该会议上发言时，控诉美国劳联召开会议的目的，是为美国独占资本服务，并愤而退出会场。许多拉丁美洲的劳工团体与著名大报，都坚决地攻击该“会议”，并不理睬其活动。劳联主席在致秘鲁劳工部长的信中，亦哀鸣“会议的失败，可能使劳联成为一个最大的笑柄。”
