Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th—The Northeast Administrative Committee passed instructions regarding the issuance of agricultural loans and spring plowing preparation work. It roughly stated: In order to vigorously develop agriculture, increase grain production, better organize farmers' production, help hired and poor peasants solve some of their production funding difficulties, and adapt to the needs of developing special products such as cotton and hemp, it has been decided this year to issue 4.5 billion in interest-free agricultural loans. Last year's agricultural loans will be recovered (except for those unable to repay) and reissued along with this year's agricultural loans. The production movement based on the thorough and equal distribution of land to solve the production funds of hired and poor peasants relies mainly on confiscating the property of landlords and levying surplus property from rich peasants. All localities should pay attention to checking whether the property distributed to the masses is used for production and establishing a home and career, and prevent squandering and waste. The government's agricultural loans should be used in a focused and concentrated manner. The target of loan issuance should first be hired and poor peasants who lack draught animals and farm tools, and the distribution should be discussed and evaluated democratically through poor peasants' leagues or farmers' associations. The use of loans should focus on purchasing draught animals, seeds, restoring paddy fields, planting cotton, immigration, etc., and should not be diverted to other uses, nor should it be distributed equally. The distribution of loans should be based on the production plans of each county and careful calculations. After each province receives agricultural loans, they should be issued in a timely manner to coordinate with the equal distribution of land.

The instructions continued: Before spring plowing, the following preparatory work should be noted in terms of leadership: (1) Based on the overall task of increasing production, each province and county should formulate and inspect its own production plans, conduct detailed investigation and calculation as a basis for setting plans, complete, and strive to exceed the increase in grain production. (2) Adjust livestock locally and externally in a planned manner, establish livestock exchanges, mobilize urban livestock to go to the countryside, and reduce urban carriages. Border areas are strictly prohibited from exporting plowing cattle, strictly prohibit the slaughter of plowing cattle, and prevent winter and spring plagues of cattle. (3) Immigrants going to the countryside to engage in agricultural production can reduce urban consumption and increase rural labor. To help them settle down and start a business, governments at all levels should earnestly complete this work before spring plowing. For the land, housing, and some difficulties in production and life of immigrants, they should be practically solved according to the different conditions of the local area. The government's immigration loans can only solve part of the problem, and the main reliance is on the local government to organize the masses to solve the difficulties of immigrants. (4) After the land is broken up and distributed equally, the original reserved seeds may not be suitable. Areas with poor harvests last year feel that seeds are difficult. In addition to the masses exchanging them themselves, each province and county should select good seeds and special crop seeds and prepare for exchange. Restore local furnaces and blacksmith furnaces to help farmers manufacture and repair farm tools. (5) Mobilize and organize the masses to collect fertilizer, chop firewood, and engage in winter production, especially in some areas with poor harvests, attention should be paid to preparation to prevent spring famine, so as not to affect spring plowing. Special difficulties will be remedied by the provincial government and organized by the masses to help each other. (6) The construction departments of each province and the construction sections of county governments should strengthen investigation and research work. Summarize the experience of mass production organizations to prepare for the deployment of spring plowing work.

　　东北发农贷四十五亿
  　集中使用，首先发给雇贫。由贫农团、农会讨论分配。
    【新华社东北二十四日电】东北行政委员会通过关于发放农业贷款与春耕准备工作指示。略称：为大力发展农业，增产粮食，更好的组织农民生产，帮助雇贫农解决一部分生产资金困难，并适应发展棉麻等特产的需要，本年度决定发放四十五万万无息农业贷款，去年农贷收回（无力归还者除外）并入今年农贷重新发放。在深入平分土地基础上的生产运动，解决雇贫农生产资金主要是依靠没收地主财物及征收富农多余财物，各地应注意检查群众分到的财物，是否用在生产安家立业上，防止挥霍浪费。政府的农贷，应有重点的集中使用，发放贷款对象首先是缺乏耕畜农具的雇贫农，应经过贫农团或农会民主讨论评议分配。贷款用途着重在购买耕畜、种籽、恢复水田、植棉、移民等项，不能移作别用，不应平均分配。分配贷款应根据各县生产计划与精细计算。各省领到农贷之后，应及时发下去配合平分土地。
    指示继说：春耕前在领导上应注意下列准备工作：（一）根据总的增产任务，各省县应制定与检查自己的生产计划，进行精细的调查计算，作为定计划的基础，完成并争取超过增产粮食。（二）有计划的在本地与外处调剂牲口，建立家畜交易所，动员城市牲口下乡，减少城市马车。边缘区严禁耕畜出境，严禁宰杀耕畜，防止耕畜冬瘟与春瘟。（三）移民下乡从事农业生产，减少城市消费，增加乡村劳动力，帮助其安家立业，各级政府应于春耕前切实完成这一工作。对于移民的土地房屋以及生产上与生活上的一些困难，应根据当地不同情况切实解决。政府的移民贷款只能解决一部分问题，主要的依靠当地政府组织群众力量去解决移民困难。（四）在土地打烂平分之后，原留的种籽不一定适用，去年歉收地区，种籽感到困难，除群众自己调换外，各省县应选好种与特种作物种籽，准备调换。恢复各地铧炉与铁匠炉，帮助农民制造与修补农具。（五）动员与组织群众集肥、打柴以及冬季生产，尤其是某些歉收地区更应注意准备，防止春荒，以免影响春耕。特殊困难者由省府设法救济与组织群众互助。（六）各省建设厅、县府建设科应加强调查研究工作。总结群众生产组织经验，以准备布置春耕工作。
