Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 17th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the lives of the broad masses of people in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas are extremely difficult this winter. After the appearance of the 100,000 yuan banknote, the prices of cotton and cloth in Shanghai rose again. A cotton quilt costs over a million yuan. In the fierce northwest wind, the poor citizens, rickshaw pullers, and pedicab drivers who are out on the streets trying to make a living are still wearing tattered, thin or unlined clothing. At night, many people use sacks and large advertising papers from department stores as blankets, sleeping on the cold cement. In the dead of night, there are pitiful, trembling groans everywhere. In the severe cold of mid-November, fifty-four people froze to death in one night, including seven disabled soldiers abandoned by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. In hunger and cold, many students in Shenyang have not yet received their cotton clothes. Three thousand seven hundred "Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army" soldiers abandoned by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Shenyang are also suffering from hunger and cold, and deaths from freezing and starvation are reported daily. They are now organizing "beggar gangs" to make a living. In Changchun, threatened by a coal shortage, tree branches and bark have been stripped bare for cooking and heating. In the midst of a coal shortage in Beiping, the price of boiled water has also risen, and poor students gnaw on cold, hard cornbread, unable to afford even boiled water. A professor at Peking University wears a worn-out overcoat from twenty years ago and goes to class every day in the dusty wind, his fingers so frozen that he can't even hold the chalk. Prices in Tianjin are also soaring. Within five days, more than 2,300 citizens appealed to a certain newspaper for help due to their inability to make a living. Deaths from freezing and starvation are discovered every day, and among them are sometimes Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. Students from Laiyang who were deceived and forced to go to Qingdao by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have now become collective beggars. Public school employees in Jinan have not yet received all of their cotton clothes, and everyone shivers in the cold when going to work in the morning. Chiang Kai-shek's police in Wuxi are still on duty in their summer uniforms.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 18th: According to Shanghai newspapers, amidst widespread coal shortages in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, a monopoly organization of the four major families and political beggar organizations of the Youth Party, is implementing "control" over the production and sales of all fuel coal, thereby manipulating the market and seizing huge profits. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit "Fuel Management Committee" paid only 840,000 yuan at the official price per ton of coal produced by the Huainan Coal Mine, which it acquired last November, when delivered at Pukou. However, the price at which the committee sold it to various factories in Nanjing and put it on the black market reached 1.15 million to 2.5 million yuan or more per ton. In the process of reselling, they made several times the profit. The committee also hoarded as much as 200,000 tons of fuel coal in Shanghai, causing the price of coal in Shanghai to rise wildly, with the highest black market price exceeding 4 million yuan. The broad masses of people are suffering from this, and private coal mines are also severely impacted.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, January 20th: Shanghai Newspaper reports: Shanghai students launched a campaign to collect winter clothing to aid the poor. On the 18th of last month, Shanghai had heavy snow, and the temperature dropped below zero. On the 19th and 20th, 230 poor people froze to death on the streets, which the Chiang Kai-shek bandits ignored. Students from Tongji University took the lead in launching a campaign to collect winter clothing, and Fudan, Jiaotong, Jinan, and Daxia Universities also responded. Fudan also received unanimous support from sixteen student organizations within the school. On the first day, Tongji University collected more than 500 pieces of clothing, shoes, and socks on campus and distributed them to the poor on the streets despite the wind and snow. Rickshaw pullers volunteered to transport them for free, driving for five or six hours without asking for a penny. By the fourth day, the school's fundraising group had increased from fourteen to more than fifty, and the fundraising campaign had expanded from within the school to outside the school. On the 21st, more than 300 students spent the whole day in Hongkou, Yangshupu, Zhabei and other places, collecting 3,000 pieces of clothing, shoes, socks, quilts, scarves, etc. This movement is still developing.

　　没有棉衣没有煤炭蒋区到处冻死贫民
    【新华社陕北十七日电】综合消息：蒋区广大人民，今冬生活极苦。十万大钞出现后，上海棉和布又涨了价，一条棉被要百万元以上。暴烈的西北风中，奔走街头谋生的贫苦市民，三轮车夫和黄包车夫，还穿着褴褛破烂的单衣或夹衣。晚上许多人则以麻袋和百货公司的大幅广告纸当作被子，露宿在冰冷的水门汀上。夜深人静时，到处发出凄厉颤抖的呻吟，十一月中旬暴寒，一夜就冻死了五十四个人，其中七个是被蒋匪抛弃的残废军人。在饥寒中的沈阳许多学生棉衣尚未上身。被蒋匪弃置在沈的三千七百个“东北抗日义勇军”亦饥寒交迫，冻饿而死者日有所闻，现正组织“讨饭团”谋生。煤荒威胁下的长春，树枝树皮都被人剥光，用以煮饭及取暖，北平煤荒声中，开水也涨了价，穷学生们啃着冰泠的硬窝窝头，连开水也喝不起。北大某教授穿着廿年前的破旧大衣每天在漫天风沙中跑去上课，手指冻得粉笔也拿不起来。天津物价亦暴涨中，五日之内因无法生活，向某报呼吁求助的市民达二千三百余人。冻饿而死者连日均有发现，且其中时有蒋军军人。被蒋匪骗迫至青岛之莱阳学生，今已陷为集体乞丐。济南公教人员的棉衣到现在还没有发齐，晨起上班，大家都瑟缩打战。无锡之蒋匪警察现在还穿着夏季制服站岗。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据沪报消息：蒋管区普遍煤荒声中，四大家族垄断机构及青年党政治乞丐参与分肥的经济部燃料管理委员会，实行全部燃煤产销之“管制”，从而操纵市场攫取暴利。蒋匪“燃管会”去年十一月收购之淮南煤矿产煤，于浦口交货每吨仅付官价八十四万元，而该会售与南京各工厂及投入黑市者每吨价格竟达一百十五万至二百五十万元以上。转手之间，获利数倍。该会并在上海囤积燃煤达二十万吨之巨，致上海煤价疯狂上涨，黑市最高价格已突破四百万元大关。广大人民均蒙其害，民营煤矿亦受深重打击。
    【新华社华东二十日电】沪报讯：上海学生发动劝募寒衣救济贫民运动。上月十八日上海大雪，温度隆至零度以下。十九、二十两日就有贫民二百三十人冻死街头，蒋匪视若无睹。同济学生首先发起劝募寒衣，复旦、交通、暨南、大夏等大学亦纷起响应，复旦并获得校内十六个社团一致支持。同济第一日在校内募集衣服鞋袜五百余件，并冒风雪分送街头贫民。三轮车夫自愿义务运送，连驶五六小时不要分文。到第四天，该校劝募小组由十四个增至五十余个，劝募运动亦由校内扩至校外，二十一日，三百余学生整日在虹口、杨树浦、闸北等地，共募得衣服鞋袜棉被围巾等达三千件。此一运动仍在发展中。
