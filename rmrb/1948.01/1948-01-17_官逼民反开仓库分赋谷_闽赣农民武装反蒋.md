Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 13th: According to consolidated reports from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas, the people's armed forces in Fujian and Jiangxi provinces have shown significant development over the past year, numbering nearly ten thousand by the end of last year. Among them, there are eleven units in Fujian, totaling at least over seven thousand, with a wide range of activities. The main ones are: (1) One unit on the Fujian-Guangdong-Jiangxi border, which had only a little over one hundred men with guns in the autumn of 1946, connected with the people's armed forces in Rao Ping and other counties in Guangdong Province. Their guerrilla area was limited to Zhao'an and Yunxiao counties, but now it has expanded tenfold. Their area of activity has also expanded to Zhangpu, Longxi, and the bordering areas of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces, including Heping, Yongding, Shanghang, Wuping, Changting, Ninghua, and the mountainous areas of Liancheng, Longyan, and other counties. The leader is Huang Shicheng, who has now established the Fujian-Guangdong Border Region Command. They have put forward the slogan of "Oppose the Three Levies (referring to grain requisition, forced loans, and conscription), eradicate local tyrants," and launched mass struggles. (2) The Yandang Mountain troops in the Zhejiang-Fujian border region, whose area of activity in Fujian Province includes Fuding, Fu'an, Xiapu, Lianjiang, Shouning, Ningde, Pingnan, and other counties. In addition, the peasants in the aforementioned counties established the "Fujian People's Livelihood Team" last year, with as many as twelve teams. (3) In central Fujian Province, Chiang-controlled newspapers reported in the lower half of 1946 that there were "economic guerrillas" composed of demobilized New Fourth Army soldiers, including Chen Gu Lao's unit with over a hundred men, Liu Runshi's unit with over a hundred men, and other units, active along the Min River. Now, a military sub-district command has been established in central Fujian, with Huang Guozhang as the commander. The Daiyun Mountains area has the Daiyun Column and Wang's unit. The three units have now merged and are launching movements such as "Oppose Chiang and resist grain collection" and "Open warehouses to distribute grain" in the vast rural areas under the jurisdiction of Yongchun, Dehua, Xianyou, Putian, Nan'an, Jinjiang, Hui'an, Tong'an, Anxi, and other counties. They are also organizing the "Strong Men's Grand Alliance" against conscription. In addition to the aforementioned counties, there are other peasant and fisherman units active in the northern Chong'an, Pucheng, and the sea areas bordering Fujian and Zhejiang.

Jiangxi: There are more than ten peasant uprising armed forces, with at least two thousand people, active in Yongxin and Lianhua, near the Jinggang Mountains, the birthplace of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Jiangxi-Hunan border, including the peasant armed forces Monkey Team, Climbing Team, No Heaven Team, and He Xiguang's unit. Along the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway, in De'an, Jiujiang, and other counties, and in various places on the east bank of Poyang Lake, there were several armed units composed of peasants, righteous people from the War of Resistance, and anti-war soldiers from the Chiang army in 1946, each with hundreds of people, and equipped with weapons such as flat-trajectory guns. In the Poyang Lake area, they even raised a white flag reading "Officials force the people to rebel." Since last year, various units along the Nanchang-Xunyang Highway have attacked Chiang bandit transport vehicles at any time. In Dayu, Longnan, Xunwu, and other counties on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border, there were already some small units active in 1946. Now, they have joined forces with the people's armed forces in Nanxiong and other counties in northern Guangdong, becoming a powerful large force. Guangfeng County on the Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Fujian border is said to be an important stronghold of the people's armed forces in Zhejiang and Fujian, with Zeng Jingbing leading troops stationed there.
