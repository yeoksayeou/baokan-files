Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 25th: (Comprehensive Report) "The Labor government's policy of surrendering to Wall Street has caused a deepening domestic crisis and serious social struggles in Britain" (Soviet Labor News). Under the severe economic crisis, the reactionary Labor government still places all its hopes on American "aid," which only makes the crisis worse. According to reliable sources, one of the main contents of the British economic plan, revised according to the will of the United States, is to greatly reduce shipbuilding and housing construction plans. British Economic Minister Cripps announced in mid-January: "Steel allocations for shipbuilding will be reduced to four-fifths of last year's level," and "shipbuilding plans must be cut." This policy of subservience to the United States by the Labor government has aroused protests from all parties in Britain. According to the Workers' Daily on the 22nd, British workers are increasingly bravely protesting against these government plans. Shop representatives and trade union leaders in major British ports and shipyards are preparing to launch a widespread protest movement. Ten thousand workers in Sunderland, who depend entirely on shipbuilding for their livelihood, sent a letter to Attlee expressing strong protest. The Workers' Daily published an article denouncing "the Attlee government for going astray and completely catering to the will of the U.S. State Department." Harkster, chairman of the shipbuilding workers and technicians union in Scotland, strongly criticized Cripps' plan and declared: "Soon, one-fifth of the shipbuilding workers will be unemployed."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 25th: (London) The British economic situation is becoming more serious. According to an announcement by the British Ministry of Commerce on the 20th, the total trade deficit in Britain in 1947 reached 591.2 million pounds (approximately 2.3648 billion U.S. dollars), an increase of more than 200 million pounds compared to 1946. This serious trade imbalance is making the British financial deficit increasingly large, forcing the Labor government to continue drawing on the nearly exhausted American loan. According to TASS news, Britain recently withdrew another 25 million pounds from the American loan. The press tycoon Kemsley's "Daily Graphic" revealed: "Only 50 million pounds are left of the American loan, and it will be used up by the end of February." Therefore, "panic and pessimism shroud Britain." At the same time, the British business newspaper "The Economist" stated on the 17th: "Inflation in Britain is about to reach the edge of disaster." Along with the increasingly serious inflation comes the news of "skyrocketing prices." "Shoe prices will rise again in the short term," "New sock prices take effect on January 19th," and "Food and other daily necessities have greatly increased in price," these are the voices of resentment that British people are talking about everywhere.

　　工党头子投靠美帝结果
  　英经济危机更厉害
    人民提出强烈抗议
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】综合报导：“工党政府对华尔街的投降政策，引起了英国国内危机的深化与严重的社会斗争”（苏联劳动报）。在深重的经济危机下，反动的工党政府仍把一切希望寄托在美国的“援助”上，这更使危机越陷越深。据确实消息，英国依照美国意志所修改的经济方案，其主要内容之一，便是大大缩减造船业与房屋建筑的计划。英经济部大臣克利浦斯于本月中旬宣布：“对于造船业的钢配给量，将减少至去年的五分之四”，“造船计划必须予以削减”。工党政府此种对美屈从政策，引起英国各方的抗议。据工人日报廿二日讯，英国工人越来越勇敢地抗议政府的这些计划。英各大港口与船坞的车间代表与工会领袖们，正准备发动广泛的抗议运动。完全依靠造船业为生的孙德兰的一万工人，致函向艾德礼提出强烈抗议。工人日报著文痛斥“艾德礼政府走入歧途，完全迎合美国务院的意志”。苏格兰某地的造船工人与技师职工会主席哈克斯特力斥克利浦斯计划，并宣称：“不久将有五分之一的造船工人失业。”
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】伦敦讯：英国经济情况更趋严重。据英商务部二十日宣布：一九四七年英国贸易的入超总额达五亿九千一百二十万镑（约二十三亿六千四百八十万美元）。较一九四六年激增二亿镑以上。此种贸易上严重的不平衡，使得英国财政的亏空越来越大，迫使工党政府不得不继续提取即将用完的美国贷款。据塔斯社消息：最近英国又从美国贷款中提取二千五百万镑。报阀克姆斯莱的“每日画报”透露：“美国贷款现在只剩下五千万镑，不出本年二月底就要花光了”。因此，“恐慌与悲观笼罩英伦”。同时，英企业家机关报“经济学者”于十七日载称：“英国的通货膨胀即将到达灾难的边缘”。随日益严重的通货膨胀而来的，是“百物暴涨”的消息，“鞋子短期内又将涨价”，“袜子新价一月十九日生效”，“食物与其他日用品又大涨特涨”，这些是英国人民到处谈论着的怨愤的声音。
