Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd:

The spokesperson of the Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters recently issued a statement summarizing the war achievements of the Northeast Liberated Area throughout 1947, stating: Over the past year, our army has fought heroically, launched four powerful offensives, annihilated more than 280,000 enemies, and recovered 65 cities. This enabled our Northeast Army to switch to the counter-offensive at an early stage, completely taking the initiative in the war, forcing the enemy into a comprehensive defense, and causing a fundamental change in the Northeast war situation. Reviewing the changes in the war situation over the past year: After the Jiang bandits occupied Andong, Tonghua, and vast areas of southern Manchuria in the autumn of the previous year (1946), their offensive reached its peak. However, the enemy still attempted to adopt a strategy of attacking the south and defending the north, and after "suppressing" southern Manchuria, they turned their troops north across the Songhua River. In the first three months of last year, the enemy successively concentrated all the forces they could mobilize and launched four consecutive offensives against the narrow area of Linjiang in southern Manchuria. Our army, with the aim of ensuring the base areas of both northern and southern Manchuria and thwarting the enemy's operational policy of "first south, then north," our southern Manchuria troops annihilated the enemy's 25th Division, and inflicted annihilating blows on the enemy in each offensive. Our northern Manchuria troops took the initiative to attack and carried out the famous "Four Down the Jiangnan" operations. This caused the enemy to be attacked from both north and south and annihilated piecemeal, completely crushing the enemy's strategic policy of "first south, then north." In total, the three months of the spring offensive resulted in the annihilation of 43,000 enemies and the recovery of 11 cities, basically halting the strategic offensive of the enemy in the Northeast and forcing them to switch to a comprehensive defense. In early May, our army, with the aim of opening up the connection between the two major strategic areas of northern and southern Manchuria, annihilating enemy manpower, recovering lost territory, and opening up the situation, simultaneously launched a summer offensive against the dispersed enemy from the eastern, western, and southern Manchuria battlefields. In the areas of Huaide, Qingyuan, and Meihe, the main force of the enemy's 71st Army, New 1st Army, and 60th Army were largely or partially annihilated. Two major gaps were opened up in the enemy's entire defense system from the east and west, and the Chang(chun)-Shen(yang) section and the Ji(lin)-Shen(yang) section of the Chinese Chang Railway were cut into several sections. The enemies scattered in Hailong, Dongfeng, Laoyeling, Xi'an, Xifeng, Tonghua, Andong, and Chifeng were also completely or largely annihilated by us. As a result, we recovered the vast areas occupied by the enemy after the Siping campaign the previous year, forcing the enemy to shrink from "mobile defense" to the narrow lines of the Chinese Chang and Beining Railways, adopting the so-called "key point defense." We then launched an offensive against Siping, a key point of the enemy's defense, inflicting a major blow on the enemy, and further forced the enemy to contract most of its main force to the strongholds around Shenyang. The summer offensive lasted for more than fifty days, annihilating more than 89,000 enemies and recovering 42 cities, linking our eastern, western, northern, and southern Manchuria and Rehe and eastern Hebei liberated areas into one, thereby changing the entire war situation in the Northeast. Du Yuming, the Northeast bandit leader who once clamored for "receiving Harbin in three months," also rolled away with the disastrous defeat of the summer campaign. Replacing Du bandit was Jiang thief Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, who, as soon as he took office, also boasted: "Turning the advantage in the Northeast in six months," and criticized Du Yuming's "key point defense" as a passive policy, advocating a return to "mobile defense." However, just as his boasting was at its peak, he was hit head-on by the autumn offensive launched by our army in mid-September. Our army's offensive began with three battles and three victories along the Beining Railway, inflicting an annihilating blow on the main force of the 49th Army, which came to aid from afar, and largely annihilating the enemy's Provisional 22nd Division and Provisional 59th Division, cutting the Beining Line into several sections. In three days, we completely destroyed the Chinese Chang Railway, which the enemy had been rushing to repair for more than three months and was about to open to traffic. Then, dividing our troops north, we successively occupied Jiutai, Nong'an, Dehui, and all the strongholds around Ji(lin) and Chang(chun), making the two major cities of Ji and Chang completely isolated, becoming dead cities, shrinking back waiting for aid, and daring not to move out. The 21st and 43rd Divisions, which came to aid from eastern Hebei, were annihilated by us at Jiutai Pass, and the Provisional 3rd Army, which was transferred from Suiyuan, was hurriedly transferred back to Guan Nei because Shimen was liberated by us. The autumn offensive lasted for more than fifty days, annihilating more than 69,000 enemies. A total of thirty regular divisions, fourteen reorganized divisions, one cavalry division, and four cavalry brigades of the enemy troops were annihilated or repeatedly struck with annihilation. Fifteen cities were recovered, forcing the enemy to shrink into twenty-four large and small cities, most of which were cut off from coal, grain, and power sources, putting the enemy troops in the Northeast in an unprecedentedly serious predicament, while we have grasped the initiative of the entire war. The winter offensive, launched in December, has only begun for half a month, but has already annihilated more than 23,000 enemies and recovered 7 cities, forcing the enemy to draw from the east to supplement the west, in a panic. And our army's offensive is still unfolding vigorously. Under the blows of our increasingly powerful offensive operations, the Jiang bandits in the Northeast will fall into an irretrievable situation, and will eventually be completely annihilated. The liberation of all the people of the Northeast is getting closer and closer. (Editor's note: The talk only lists the results of each offensive. The total number of enemies annihilated by the Northeast People's Liberation Army in the past year, including the results of the battles between the offensives and the results of the local army's year of battles, as well as the results of our army in Jicha Rehe during the spring campaign, should be statistically combined to a total of more than 280,000).

### 东北解放军发言人谈：  战局已起根本变化　我军完全掌握主动

　　东北解放军发言人谈：
    战局已起根本变化
  　我军完全掌握主动
    【新华社东北三日电】东北人民解放军司令部发言人顷就东北解放区一九四七年全年战绩总结发表谈话略称：一年来我军英勇作战，发动了四次强大的攻势，歼敌二十八万余，收复城市六十五座。使东北我军及早转入反攻，完全掌握战争的主动，迫使敌人处于全面防御，使东北战局发生了根本的变化。回溯一年来战局的变化：当前年（一九四六年）秋季蒋匪占领安东、通化及南满广大地区后，其进攻即已达顶点，但敌仍妄图采取南攻北守之势，于“肃清”南满后，转兵北越松花江。去年头三个月敌曾先后集中一切可能动员的兵力，对南满临江一带之狭小地区，连续进行了四次进攻。我军则以确保南北满根据地，打破敌“先南后北”之作战方针为目的，我南满部队当歼灭敌二五师，并对敌每次进攻，均给以歼灭打击。我北满部队则主动出击，进行了有名的“四下江南”的作战。使敌遭到南北夹击，各个歼灭，全部粉碎了敌“先南后北”的战略方针。总计春季攻势三个月作战，歼敌四万三千，收复城市十一座，基本上停止了东北敌人的战略性进攻，迫其转入全面防御。五月初我军以打通南北满两大战略区之联系，歼敌有生力量，收复失地，打开局面为目的，对分散守备之敌，从东西南满各战场，同时展开夏季攻势，在怀德、清原、梅河等地区，将敌七一军、新一军、六十军等主力部队大部或一部歼灭。敌之整个防御体系，由东西两面被打开两大缺口，中长路之长（春）沈（阳）段，吉（林）沈段交通线被切为数段。分散在海龙、东丰、老爷岭、西安、西丰、通化、安东、赤峰之敌，也都遭我全部或大部歼灭。由此我便收复了前年四平战役以后敌侵占之广大地区，迫敌由“机动防御”缩入中长及北宁狭长线上，探取所谓“重点防御”。我当又向敌防御重点之四平发动进攻，予敌重大打击，再迫使敌将大部主力收缩于沈阳外围各据点。夏季攻势共连续五十余天，歼敌八万九千余，收复城市四二座，使我东西南北满及热河、冀东等各解放区联成一片，从而改变了东北整个战局。曾一时叫嚣什么“三个月接收哈尔滨”的东北匪首杜聿明也随着夏季作战的惨败而滚了蛋。代替杜匪的是蒋贼参谋总长陈诚，刚一上台，也大肆吹牛：“六个月转变在东北的优势”，并斥责杜聿明的“重点防御”为消极方针，而主张重采“机动防御”。但其吹兴方浓时，便遭到我九月中旬开始发动的秋季攻势的当头棒。我军攻势首以三战三捷于北宁沿线展开，给远道来援的四九军主力以歼灭打击，并予敌暂廿二师及暂五十九师以大部歼灭，将北宁线切为数段，并在三日间将敌抢修三月有余即将通车之中长路完全平毁，随即分兵北上，先后攻占九台、农安、德惠及吉（林）长（春）外围之一切据点，使吉、长两大城市完全陷于孤立，成为死城，龟缩待援，不敢出动。其先后由冀东来援之二十一师及四十三师则于九台关门遭我歼灭打击，由绥远调来之暂三军，则因石门被我解放，又仓皇调回关内。秋季攻势共持续五十余日，歼敌六万九千余，被歼灭或一再被歼灭性打击之敌军共有三十个正规师，十四个整编师，一个骑兵师，四个骑兵旅等。收复城市十五座，迫敌龟缩于二十四个大小城市之内，大部被断绝了煤源、粮源、电源，使东北敌军陷于空前严重的困境，我则掌握了全部战争的主动权。十二月发起的冬季攻势，虽只开始半月，即已歼敌二万三千余，收复城市七座，迫敌抽东补西，慌作一团。而我军攻势犹正猛烈展开，在我一次比一次强大的攻势作战的打击下，东北蒋匪将落到无可挽救的局面，最后必将全部被歼。全东北人民的解放已日益接近了。（编者按：谈话中仅列举各次攻势战果，应将各次攻势间之战果及地方军一年战果与春季战役中冀察热辽我军战果统计合共东北解放军一年来歼敌总数为二十八万余）。
