Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: New York dispatch: The American working class is enthusiastically responding to the call of the American Conference on China and Far East Policy to take action to prevent the US government from shipping military supplies to Chiang Kai-shek, the Netherlands, and France. Several progressive leaders of unions affiliated with the CIO, AFL, and independent unions, including Joseph Curran, President of the National Maritime Union; Michael Quill, President of the Transport Workers Union of America; E.F. Burke, President of the National Marine Cooks and Stewards; Lewis Merrill, President of the United Office and Professional Workers of America; and Irving Potash, President of the Fur and Leather Workers Union, jointly urged the American labor people to support the above-mentioned conference decision. In a telegram, these union leaders stated: "We pledge our heartfelt support for any action by American maritime unions to aid the cause of peace by depriving the reactionary war makers of China of weapons. We call on all organized labor in America to support this program. We further call on the leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions to urge their affiliated unions in all countries to prevent arms shipments to China and other countries – France, the Netherlands – which are currently waging war against the people of Indonesia and Vietnam who are fighting for national independence." The actions of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union and the National Marine Cooks and Stewards to boycott shipping (including the war materials to be shipped to China under the Truman aid-Chiang plan) have been approved by the leaders of the respective unions. The International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union has more than 50,000 members and can prevent ships bound for China from loading cargo. The National Marine Cooks and Stewards has 8,000 members, including all American cooks and stewards employed on American ships, and therefore it can also halt all American ships. Both unions operate on the West Coast of America.

　　美国工人热烈响应大会号召
  　不让援蒋物资上船
  　有力量使美国一切船只停航
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】纽约讯：美国工人阶级，热烈响应美国对华及远东政策会议以行动阻止美政府援蒋及援荷、援法军火物资船运的号召。若干产联、劳联所属工会及独立工会进步领袖，包括美国交通协会主席雪利、美国运输工人工会主席薛尔、美国海运厨夫膳务员工会主席布利逊、美国职员与自由职业者联合会主席达肯、国际毛皮及皮革工人工会主席高尔德等，一致敦促美国劳动人民支持上述会议决定。这些工会领袖在通电中称：“美国各海员工会为援助和平事业，而剥夺中国反动战争制造者的武器的任何行动，我们誓必衷心支持。我们号召美国一切有组织的劳工，支持这个纲领。我们更号召世界职工联盟领袖敦促其所属各国工会，阻止对中国及其他国家——法、荷——的军火船运。法荷两国现正在对争取民族独立的印尼与越南人民进行战争。”国际码头工人及仓库工人工会、美国海运厨夫膳务员工会抵制船运（包括杜鲁门援蒋计划中即将运华之作战物资）的行动，已经得到各该工会领袖的批准。按国际码头工人及仓库工人工会拥有会员五万人以上，它能阻止开往中国的船舶上货。美国海运厨夫膳务员工会有会员八千人，包括美国船只上所雇用的所有美国厨夫及膳务员，因此它亦能够使美国一切船只停航。两工会皆在美洲西海岸活动。
