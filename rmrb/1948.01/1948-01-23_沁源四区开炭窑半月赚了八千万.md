　　【Taiyue News】During the winter production in the Fourth District of Qinyuan, twelve coal kilns were restored and newly opened. In Gaojiashan, there was originally one kiln, and another was opened, producing 80 loads of coal per day. In Sujiazhuang, two kilns were restored, producing 50 loads of coal per day. In Fugui Village, two kilns were restored, producing 45 loads per day. In Shuiyu, there were originally two kilns, and one was newly opened, producing 160 loads of coal per day. In Caiziping, one kiln was restored, producing 120 loads of coal per day. In Congziyu, two kilns were restored, and one was newly opened, producing 70 loads of coal per day. Together with the six kilns in Xiaoling Xindian, there were a total of eighteen coal kilns, producing a total of 929 loads of coal per day, which could generate an income of 542,000 yuan in silver dollars. Because the main roads have been repaired, the carts transporting public grain in Qinyuan, Tunliu and other counties can carry large quantities of coal back. The coal kiln business is very profitable. The Congziyu coal kiln once sold for more than 300,000 yuan per day, which, at the time, could buy more than 20 piculs of millet, with each picul of millet worth 12,000 yuan. In half a month, the eighteen coal kilns earned a total of more than 81.13 million yuan.
