　　The CCP Northwest Bureau recently convened a conference of senior party cadres from the entire region in a certain area of northern Shaanxi, lasting nearly a month, to report and discuss the major issues of how to complete land reform in the border region. On the opening day of the conference, Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau, Comrade Lin Boqu, Chairman of the Border Government, and Comrade He Long, Commander of the Northwest Joint Defense Army, delivered important speeches respectively. After analyzing the current new situation in the Great Northwest, they emphasized that this conference should review the Northwest Bureau's past policies, guidelines, and cadres' ideology, work style, and class stand under the guiding ideology of wholeheartedly serving the people and being a long-term worker for the laboring working class and peasant masses, so that we can be more powerful and healthier to meet the new situation of liberating the Great Northwest. Comrade Xi Zhongxun made a preliminary comprehensive review of the errors and shortcomings exposed in various aspects since the border region's self-defense war. He reviewed that the Northwest Bureau in the past did not resolutely rely on poor and lower-middle peasants to mobilize the masses in solving the land problem, and did not pay attention to examining and criticizing the ideological stand of cadres at all levels, and timely prevent the attack of landlord ideas. Among some cadres at the border region and district levels, there had been a tendency of ideological degeneration and some serious confused ideas or blind complacency. He reviewed that his attitude towards these phenomena was guilty of liberalism and bureaucracy, and pointed out that the conference's policy was to let go and promote democracy, use the method of class analysis to conduct criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom and from bottom to top of all past work, in order to achieve the purpose of clarifying thinking and rectifying the organization. Chairman Lin's report has preliminarily reviewed that the border region government lacked a sufficient mass perspective in implementing the Three-Thirds System policy and in the work of education, justice, finance and other aspects. He also criticized himself for overemphasizing the history of certain local old cadres, which led to liberalism towards the shortcomings and errors of the former Director of the Finance Department, Huo Weide, such as extravagant living, wasting public funds, and being divorced from the masses. Commander He sharply criticized the serious mistakes made by individual senior cadres in seeking independence from the Party. He severely condemned certain army cadres for protecting landlords, resisting land reform, oppressing laboring peasants, and violating government laws, which were intolerable principled errors. In the future, warlordism should be completely eradicated, and the troops should be trained into a people's army that truly obeys the Party and the interests of the revolution. Such serious criticisms from Xi, Lin, and He became the force that encouraged the conference to launch self-criticism, and were warmly responded to by the entire audience of party members. In group discussions, the conference deeply explored problems, carried out serious ideological struggles against errors, and after discussing the Land Law Outline item by item based on Comrade Li Zhuoran's report on the National Land Conference and the Land Law Outline, it then moved on to the conference discussion. Major cadres all made separate reviews of their work, and the speeches of Comrades Jia Tuofu, Wang Weizhou, and Li Hebang were given importance by the conference. Jia Tuofu reviewed that the department he was in charge of made wrong business decisions without the approval of the Party and government's senior leading organs, resulting in huge losses to the border region's financial finance and military and civilian economy, which was a principled error of seeking independence from the Party. He further reviewed that the root cause of the errors and deviations that occurred in his work within two years of his tenure was the stand of petty-bourgeois individualism and the subjective ideology, as well as bureaucracy and liberalism in his work style. However, Gao Feng, former Secretary of the Sanbian Prefectural Committee, Wu Zhiyuan, Commissioner, Tang Hongcheng, Deputy Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Border Government, and Zhou Xing, Director of the Security Office of the Border Region, etc., did not deeply review their mistakes. Under the request of the conference and the influence of the conference spirit, they are prepared to continue to make further reviews. Wu Daifeng, Commander of the Suide District Garrison Command, twice reviewed the serious crimes of his subordinates in undermining government laws, infringing on the interests of the people, arbitrarily beating and scolding the masses, hindering land reform, accepting bribes to privately release reactionary landlords from the country, and stealing the fruits of mass struggle, which were extremely vague, arousing dissatisfaction from the entire audience, who unanimously demanded his removal from office, which was agreed to by the presidium of the conference (he has expressed after the conference that he will resolutely correct his mistakes). Some party members and cadres who were originally not at ease in their work were inspired by the spirit of the conference and felt that their past ideological consciousness dominated by personal plans was extremely wrong and felt secretly ashamed. After the conference discussion, Comrade Xi Zhongxun made a summary report. He made a clear analysis and estimation of the past work in various aspects of the border region, and also put forward specific plans on how to implement the Land Law Outline in the future. Then, Comrade Ma Wenrui, Minister of the Organization Department of the Northwest Bureau, announced to the conference the decision of the Northwest Bureau on the punishment of nine party member cadres, which was unanimously approved by the conference. Comrade He Long made important comments on issues such as policy changes, mass viewpoints, mobilizing the masses, and ideological struggle within the Party, which were raised in the conference discussion. Finally, Chairman Lin delivered a closing speech. He said that this conference was the most successful and historically significant meeting since the Border Region High-Level Cadre Meeting in 1942. He called on everyone to open their minds, put down their burdens, and honestly be the people's servants under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. He encouraged everyone to pack their bags and go to the countryside to implement the spirit of this conference, thoroughly complete the land reform in the border region, and strive to organize peasant production to better support the front.

    【新华社西北电】中共中央西北局近于陕北某地召开全区高级党员干部大会，历时近月，报告和讨论如何完成边区土地改革的重大问题。大会开幕日由西北局书记习仲勋同志、边府主席林柏渠同志、西北联防军司令员贺龙同志分别作重要发言。他们于分析目前大西北新形势后，强调说明这次大会要在全心全意为人民服务、替劳苦工农群众当长工的指导思想下，检讨过去西北局的政策方针，及干部的思想作风与阶级立场，使我们更加有力，更加健康来迎接解放大西北的新局面。习仲勋同志对边区自卫战争以来各方面所暴露的错误和缺点，作了初步的全面检讨。他检讨西北局过去解决土地问题没有坚决依靠贫雇农，放手发动群众，没有注意审查和批评各级干部的思想立场，并及时防止地主思想影响的袭击。在边区及分区一级若干干部中，曾经发生思想意识堕落及某些严重的糊涂观念或盲目自满的倾向。他检讨自己对这些现象的态度犯了自由主义与官僚主义的毛病，指出大会方针是放手发扬民主，用阶级的分析的方法，对过去一切工作进行从上而下与从下而上的批评与自我批评，以达到搞通思想和整顿组织的目的。林主席的报告已初步检讨了边区政府在执行三三制政策及教育司法财经等工作中，都缺乏充分的群众观点。他并批评自己过分看重某些地方老干部的历史，以致于对前财政厅长霍维德生活铺张，浪费公费，脱离群众等缺点和错误犯了自由主义。贺司令员尖锐批评个别高级干部对党闹独立性所犯的重大错误。他严厉指责某些军队干部包庇地主，违抗土地改革，欺压劳苦农民，破坏政府法令的不能容忍的原则性错误。今后应彻底铲除军阀主义，把部队练成真正服从党与革命利益的人民军队。习、林、贺这种严肃的批评成为鼓舞大会展开自我批评的力量，而受到全场党员的热烈响应。大会在分组讨论中深入发掘问题，对错误进行严肃的思想斗争，并根据李卓然同志关于全国土地会议及土地法大纲的传达，逐条讨论土地法大纲后，继即转入大会讨论。各主要干部均分别对自己的工作进行检讨，贾拓夫、王维舟及李合邦等同志的发言，受到大会的重视。贾拓夫检讨该部门未经党政高级领导机关批准，擅自决定错误的业务方针，招致边区财政金融与军民经济的巨大损失，是对党闹独立性的原则性错误。他进而检讨自己任职两年内，在工作中所发生的错误和偏向的根源，是小资产阶级个人主义的立场和主观主义的思想方法，以及作风上的官僚主义与自由主义。但前三边地委书记高峰、专员吴志渊、边府民厅副厅长唐洪澄及边区保安处处长周兴等对错误检讨均不深刻，他们在大会要求与大会精神影响之下，准备继续作进一步的检讨。绥德分区警备司令部吴岱峰对其部属破坏政府法令，侵犯人民利益，任意打骂群众，阻碍土地改革，受贿私放反动地主出境，并窃取群众斗争果实等严重罪过的两次反省，均极含糊，引起全场不满，一致要求将其撤职，得到大会主席团的同意（大会后彼已表示要坚决改正自己错误的态度）。若干原来不安心工作的党员、干部受到大会精神的感召，认为过去以个人打算为主的思想意识，极为错误而暗自愧悔。大会讨论后，由习仲勋同志作总结性报告，他对边区过去各方面的工作作了明确的分析和估计，对今后如何贯彻土地法大纲亦提出了具体方案。接着西北局组织部长马文瑞同志向大会宣布了西北局关于处分九个党员干部的决定，得到了大会一致的通过。贺龙同志针对大会讨论中所提出的政策转变、群众观点、发动群众及党内思想斗争等问题发表重要意见。最后林主席致闭幕词，他说这次大会是一九四二年边区高干会后第一次最成功最有历史意义的会议，他号召大家在毛泽东思想指导下，打开脑筋，放下包袱，老老实实地当人民的勤务员。勉励大家背起行李下乡去贯彻这次会议的精神，彻底完成边区的土地改革，努力组织农民生产，更好的支援前线。
