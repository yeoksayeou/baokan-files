Opinions on Popularization
    ·Zhou Fang·

Comrade Editor:

You say that we should read the newspaper to the masses immediately. Is this suggestion correct? Reading immediately lacks research time. It should be researched first, and then reading the newspaper should be organized in a planned way. Reading to the masses should not be indiscriminate; it should first be read to poor peasants and farm laborers, and then general propaganda should be conducted. When reading, it should be connected to the local reality. Situations that do not exist locally can be omitted. Use popular and appropriate language. For example, a poor peasant with one person can be allocated land for two people; here the masses call it "double portion." These are experiences gained from reading.

Recently, when drafting laws, I always used popular and mass language, but still cannot get everyone to agree. It seems that laws must be written in classical Chinese. I believe that with the poor and hired laborers in charge, it is not just a matter of changing a few leading cadres, but a complete set of reforms in all aspects. For writing, it is also within the scope of reform. Whether it is a proclamation, law, newspaper, or telegram, it should be changed to popular and mass language. Past opinions are that popular mass language is verbose and not concise. They don't know that truly refined mass language is concise, while intellectual's vernacular Chinese is verbose. Another opinion is that reading materials for cadres can or should be written in classical Chinese (especially laws). They don't know that cadres who can understand classical Chinese are only from landlord and wealthy peasant backgrounds and have attended school for many years. This time, when I went to the countryside, I saw that many district and county cadres were from peasant backgrounds. Our writing should be adapted to them. There is also a saying that popular and mass language can be used for writing articles, such as Zhao Shuli's novels, but cannot be used for laws and telegrams. This is truly an old saying that has existed since the May Fourth Movement, preserving territory for classical Chinese. Now that land reform is being carried out and the poor and hired laborers are in charge, this saying will also fall with it. Therefore, I am extremely happy to see your vernacular telegram today.

　　对通俗化的意见
    ·周方·编辑同志：
    你们说要马上向群众读报，这样提是否正确？马上读，就缺乏研究时间，应是研究一下，再有计划的组织读报，向群众读，就没有先后对象，应是先向贫雇读，再作一般宣传，读时要与当地实际连系，当地实际没有的情况，可以不读，要用通俗恰当的语言，比如一口人的贫雇可以分二口人的地，这里群众叫顶双份，这些是从读中体验得来。
    我最近起草法令，总用通俗大众语，但仍不能使人人同意，似乎法令一定应是文言，我以为雇贫当家，不单是改换几个领导骨干的问题，是一整套的各方面的改革，对于文字，也在改革之内，不管是布告，法令，报纸，电讯都要改为通俗大众语。过去的意见，一是说通俗大众语罗唆，不能简洁，不知真的洗练的大众语，是简练的，知识分子的白话文，才是罗唆嗦的，一是说干部读物可以是文言，或者应该是文言（特别是法令），不知能懂文言的干部，只是地富出身，进过多年学校的，我这次下乡，见区县干部，很多都是农民出身，我们的文字，应该适应他们。还有一说，认为通俗大众语，写文章可用，赵树理写小说可用，而法令电讯，就不可用，这真是“五四”以来多年的旧说，为文言文保存地盘，现在土地改革，雇贫当家，这一说也随之而倒，所以我今天看到你们的语体电讯，真是高兴极了。
