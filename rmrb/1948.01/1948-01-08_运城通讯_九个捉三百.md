　　Yuncheng Correspondence
  　Nine Capture Three Hundred
    On the night of the 27th, when the Liberation Army attacked Yuncheng from all directions (at dusk), the Second Battalion of the unit was tasked with the attack mission in the South Gate area. After a fierce battle, the heroes quickly ascended the city wall, and the battle developed in depth towards the city center. At this time, only Squad Leader Wang Yunfu of the Sixth Company, Seventh Squad, along with eight soldiers, were left to carry out the important task of consolidating the position around the South Gate. Wang Yunfu was a well-known combat hero in the regiment, and soldiers Li Mingshan, Zuo Meng, and others, although newly liberated soldiers, had also made contributions in many battles. Soon, the in-depth battle became more intense, and the light from the exploding grenades illuminated the surrounding area red. At this moment, a battalion of the enemy's 182nd Regiment rushed out of a large bunker, planning to escape over the city wall, and happened to encounter Wang's squad of nine men. Squad Leader Wang quickly ordered everyone to disperse, and waited until the enemy soldiers approached before shouting in unison: "The Liberation Army gives preferential treatment to prisoners, those who lay down their arms will not be killed!" The enemy soldiers, seeing that there were few of us, ignored us and still hurriedly tried to run to the city wall. Everyone was extremely resentful. Squad Leader Wang picked up a machine gun and fired, Li Mingshan and Zuo Meng charged towards the enemy with bayonets, and the other soldiers also threw grenades. The enemy soldiers wavered, and a deputy battalion commander shouted in a trembling voice: "We surrender! We surrender!" When the soldiers rushed up, more than three hundred enemy soldiers had already placed all their weapons on the ground in front of them. The soldiers counted them and found two heavy machine guns, six light machine guns, sixty-three rifles, and many scattered supplies. The soldiers looked at so many prisoners and saw that there were only nine of them, and everyone smiled victoriously.

　　运城通讯
  　九个捉三百
    二十七日夜解放军从四面八方攻打运城时（黄昏），部队第二营担任南门一带的攻击任务。经过一阵激烈战斗，英雄们迅速登上城头，战斗就向城市中心纵深发展。这时该部只剩下六连七班班长汪云福带着八个战士奉命担任巩固南门一带阵地的重要任务。汪云福是团里有名的战斗英雄，战士李明山、左孟等虽是解放不久的战士，但也在屡次战斗中立过功。不久纵深战斗越打得激烈了，手榴弹爆炸的火光把周围一片照的通红。正在这时匪军一八二团一个营从大碉中跑了出来，打算越城逃走，恰巧遇上了汪班长的九个人。汪班长迅速命令大家散开，直等到匪军逼近的时候全体一齐高喊：“解放军优待俘虏，缴枪不杀”。匪军看见我方人少故不理睬，还是急急忙忙想往城墙上跑，大家愤恨极了，汪班长抓起机枪扫射，李明山和左孟上起刺刀向匪军面前冲去，其他战士也都打了手榴弹，匪军动摇了，一个副营长带着发抖的声音连忙高喊道：“我们缴枪！我们缴枪！”当战士们冲上去的时候三百多名匪军，已把所有的武器放到自己面前的地下了。战士们点验了一下，有两挺重机枪，六挺轻机枪，六十三支步枪及很多零星物资。战士们看着这样多的俘虏，又看见自己才九个人，大家都胜利的笑了。
