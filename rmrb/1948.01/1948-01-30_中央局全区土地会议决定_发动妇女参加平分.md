　　Central Bureau Full District Land Conference Decides
  　Mobilize Women to Participate in Equal Distribution
    [Our News] In the land reform and self-defense war over the past year, the broad masses of women in the rural areas of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area have demonstrated great strength. At the district land conference held last October to December, women's work was elevated to an unprecedentedly important position. Comrade Yi Bo pointed out: Party committees at all levels should attach importance to women's work. Women's work should be elevated to a task for the entire Party, and it should not be regarded as the responsibility of only a few female comrades; every Party member should serve the broad masses of working women in the same way. He quoted Comrade Shaoqi's speech at the National Land Conference, saying: "The working people will not be liberated if half of the people are not free." However, in the year and a half of land reform in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, there were strange phenomena such as women not being allowed to leave the village and marriages requiring the approval of village cadres. Many poor and hired women actively participated in the anti-feudal struggle, but they received very little, and even less political fruit. These all proved that the broad masses of rural women, especially poor and hired women, had not completely turned over. Therefore, in the future, working women must be mobilized simultaneously in the equal distribution of land. If rural working women cannot be mobilized to participate in the equal distribution of land, the rural feudal forces cannot be completely eliminated. They should play the same role as men in land reform, large-scale production, and democratic movements. When a large number of young and middle-aged men join the army and participate in the war, it is even more necessary to cultivate women to replace men in various work positions in the rear. After the land reform, it is necessary to select activists from poor and hired women to participate in the government. Moreover, in this equal distribution of land movement, we should gradually solve many problems of women themselves and propose and formulate the program of the women's movement.
    At the district land conference, the presidium of the conference specially elected Comrade Yang Zhihua of the Central Women's Committee to make a special speech on women's issues. Comrade Zhihua first introduced the importance that the National Land Conference in September 1947 attached to women's work and the reasons for this emphasis. She said: The working women of Taihang wove 7.4 million catties of cloth in 70 days. They made a great contribution to the supply of military and civilian clothing in the liberated areas. Women in various regions have demonstrated many touching heroic deeds in the movements to join the army, participate in the war, and make military uniforms and shoes. In particular, the working women of Jinnan performed very well in sending their husbands and sons to join the army this time. There were 2,007 female village chiefs in six counties in Shandong. In Qingfeng and Nanle of Ji-Lu-Yu, half of the militiamen were women. In Huguan County, the third sub-district of Taihang, there were 5,975 male activists and 4,531 female activists. When struggling against landlords, their complaints often played a leading role. When recovering hidden wealth, they could often bravely and meticulously break through the landlords' tricks... These all showed that women had made extremely important contributions to the patriotic self-defense war and land reform. As land reform becomes more in-depth and the self-defense war develops further, women will become an indispensable force in various movements and the management of political power. But why haven't the broad masses of working women received the attention they deserve, despite making such great contributions in the past? Comrade Zhihua conveyed the National Land Conference's review of women's work, and Comrade Deng Yingchao's self-criticism: "Our class viewpoint, that is, the class line, in rural women's work in the past has been vague for a long time; in fact, we have been circling among landlord and rich peasant women above the middle peasant level, floating on the upper level, taking everything into our own hands, and thus became divorced from the basic masses." Comrade Zhihua then said: In the symposiums on women's issues in Jinnan, Taihang, and Taiyue districts, the comrades working on women's issues also unanimously reviewed: "The object of women's work during the War of Resistance Against Japan were women who were eloquent and good at speaking, looking down on the vast laboring women who were illiterate and unable to speak, considering them to be "backward," unable to leave their families, and unable to play a role; or one-sidedly emphasizing women's interests, leading to male-female opposition and disharmony between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. Because the women's movement became an isolated movement of a few people, it did not receive the sympathy of the broad masses. With the wrong line and policy, there were no achievements in the work, and women's work cadres also lost confidence in the women's movement." Comrade Liu Xiangping, secretary of the Shi Min County Party Committee in Taiyue (a female comrade), also reviewed the areas where she did not pay enough attention to women's work in her overall work. At the beginning of the district-wide land reform, some comrades split the mobilization of women and the mobilization of the masses into two stages. (Comrade Yibo also said in the conclusion of the district land conference: A great land reform that abandons half of the population, women, will not be thorough, and the task will not be completed. At the same time, it is a complete fantasy to expect women, who have been oppressed by feudalism for thousands of years, to get improvement and liberation in this great movement and then wait for the movement to pass before carrying out a political, economic, and ideological transformation.) Comrade Zhihua further explained: Because the Party is impure, it affects the ability of poor and hired women to stand up, and men and women cannot be equal. She reviewed the two different ideologies and two different lines—opportunism and anti-opportunism—in the women's movement, both past and present, both inside and outside the Party. She said: Only by taking up the unique weapon of the Communist Party, self-criticism and criticism, thoroughly settling our own thoughts, and eliminating the landlord, rich peasant, bourgeois, petty-bourgeois, and rogue proletariat's views of women that corrode the women's movement, can we honestly grasp Chairman Mao's proletarian thought and remove the stones left over from history and mixed into the proletarian ranks in society. Only Chairman Mao's central line is the line of victory.
    What is this correct and victorious line? She said: That is, the conference has determined that the poor and hired peasants should be the backbone, unite the middle peasants and other anti-feudal elements, thoroughly implement the equal distribution of land, and eliminate the landlord class. Only with this clear line can we guarantee the liberation of the broad masses of working women, and can we guarantee the realization of women's four basic demands—land, democracy, freedom of marriage, and equality between men and women. Only when women gain economic, political, and ideological fruits of struggle in the movement to eliminate feudalism and the landlord class can they completely turn over. All cadres of our Party must show the highest degree of enthusiasm to care for the liberation of women, who account for half of the population.
    Comrade Zhihua especially reminded everyone not to repeat the bureaucracy and coercion of past work; to go deep among the poor and hired women, mingle with them, listen to their opinions, and become familiar with and understand their pain and demands. It is necessary to specifically explain the Land Law Outline to them, tell them that women and men share an equal share of land and enjoy the same democracy, and encourage their enthusiasm. It is necessary to inspire them to pursue their roots of poverty and turn over and complain of suffering, so as to distinguish themselves from landlords and rich peasants and achieve a thorough turnaround. After land reform, attention should be paid to organizing women to participate in production, especially agriculture and textiles. They should be trained in various production skills and knowledge of class struggle. Various tasks to support the front require better organization of women's participation.
    Comrade Zhihua said: Leading organs at all levels should systematically cultivate and promote activists from poor and hired women and female workers to various leading positions. They should be patiently helped to solve various difficulties and trained in their ability to handle affairs. Female cadres with intellectual backgrounds should go deep into the countryside and participate in practical work at the grassroots level. This will enable them to receive education and transformation from the masses in the great land reform movement and become a long-term worker who is good at serving the people. For individual female cadres who do not seek progress, leading organs at all levels should urge, educate, and struggle against them, and should not adopt a liberal attitude.
    Finally, Comrade Zhihua told everyone: Our women's work must be combined with the overall tasks of the Party and the work arrangements of various departments, and at the same time, we must have confidence in women's work. The National Land Conference produced a great charter that broke the feudal system that has existed for thousands of years—the Chinese Land Law Outline. This is the most powerful weapon to defeat the enemy. With this weapon, we should have unwavering confidence in victory. We call on the oppressed women, who make up half of the population, to actively support the Chinese Land Law.

　　中央局全区土地会议决定
  　发动妇女参加平分
    【本报消息】晋冀鲁豫解放区农村广大妇女，在一年多土地改革与自卫战争中，表现了伟大的力量。在去年十至十二月全区土地会议上，妇女工作被提到前所未有的重要地位。一波同志指出：党的各级领导机关，应重视妇女工作。应把妇女工作提高成为全党的任务，不应把它看成只是少数女同志的责任，每个党员都应同样为广大的劳动妇女服务。并引少奇同志在全国土地会议上的发言说：“人民中还有一半人不自由，劳动人民是不会得到解放的。”而晋冀鲁豫在一年半的土改运动中，还有不准妇女出村、婚姻要经村干批准等怪现象。许多贫雇妇女积极参加了反封建斗争，但给她们的东西却很少，政治果实则更少。这些都证明广大农村妇女，尤其贫雇妇女，尚未彻底翻身。因此，今后要在平分土地运动中同时发动劳动妇女。如果不能发动起农村劳动妇女来参加平分土地运动，农村封建势力就不可能彻底消灭。她们在土改中，在大生产，在民主运动中都应该和男子起同样的作用。当着大批青壮年参军参战时，更要培养妇女在后方的各个工作岗位上代替男子。土改后要选拔贫雇妇女积极分子参加政权。并要在此次平分土地运动中，逐渐解决妇女本身的许多问题和提出及制定妇女运动的纲领。
    在全区土地会议上，大会主席团特推选中央妇委杨之华同志作妇女问题的专题发言。之华同志首先介绍了四七年九月全国土地会议对妇女工作的重视及重视的原因。她说：太行的劳动妇女，七十天内织布七百四十万斤。她们对解放区军需民用的被服供给，是有很大贡献的。各区妇女在参军、参战、做军衣军鞋等运动中，都表现了许多可歌可泣的英雄事迹。特别是冀南的劳动妇女，这次送郎送子参军，表现的很好。山东六县即有女村长两千零七人。冀鲁豫清丰、南乐有二分之一的民兵是妇女。太行三分区壶关县男积极分子有五千九百七十五人，女的有四千五百三十一人。在斗争地主时，她们的诉苦往往起了带头作用。在追索浮财时，她们经常能很勇敢、很细致的击破地主的诡计……。这些都说明了妇女对爱国自卫战争，对土地改革均有极重要的贡献。以后土地改革更加深入，自卫战争更加发展，妇女在各种运动及管理政权方面，将更成为不可缺少的力量。但是为什么广大的劳动妇女过去有这样大的贡献，却没有得到应有的重视呢？之华同志转达了全国土地会议对妇女工作的检讨，及邓颖超同志的自我批评说：“我们过去在农村妇女工作中的阶级观点，即阶级路线，是长期模糊的；实际是在中农以上的地主富农妇女中兜圈子，浮在上层，包办代替，因而脱离了基本群众。”之华同志接着说：在冀南、太行、太岳各区的妇女问题座谈会中，妇女工作同志们也一致的检讨出：“抗战中的妇女工作，是以能说会道的妇女为工作对象，看不起那些不识字不会说的广大劳动妇女力量，认为她们“落后”，离不开家庭，起不了作用；或是片面的强调妇女利益，发生男女对立，婆媳不和现象。由于妇女运动成为少数人孤立的运动，得不到广大群众的同情。路线方针错了，工作没有成绩，妇女工作干部也就失掉对妇运的信心。”太岳士敏县委书记刘湘屏同志（系女同志），也检讨了自己在全面工作中注意妇女工作不够的地方。在全区土地改革开始时，有些同志把发动妇女与发动群众分裂成两个阶段。（一波同志在全区土地会议的结论中也说：伟大的土地改革，丢掉占人口一半的妇女，运动是不会彻底的，任务也是完不成的。同时受了几千年封建压迫的妇女，不能在这个大运动中得到提高、解放，而要等待运动过去了再来个政治、经济、思想上的翻身运动，完全是幻想。）之华同志又说明：因党内不纯，影响贫雇妇女不能抬头，男女不能平等。她检讨了过去和现在妇女运动中在党内党外有两种不同的思想，有两种不同的路线——机会主义与反机会主义的路线。她说：只有拿起共产党所特有的武器，自我批评与批评，彻底清算自己的思想，清除腐蚀妇女运动的地主富农、资产阶级、小资产阶级以及流氓无产阶级的妇女观点，这样才能老老实实掌握毛主席的无产阶级思想，才能够搬掉历史上遗留下来的、社会上混进无产阶级队伍中来的石头。只有毛主席中央的路线是胜利的路线。
    这个正确的胜利的路线是什么呢？她说：即大会已确定的要以贫雇为骨干，团结中农及其他反封建分子，彻底实行平分土地，消灭地主阶级。有了这个明确的路线，才能保证广大劳动妇女的解放，才能保证实现妇女四大基本要求——土地、民主、婚姻自主自由及男女平等。妇女只有在消灭封建消灭地主阶级的运动中，获得了经济上、政治上、思想上的斗争果实，才能彻底翻身。我党一切干部要用最高度的热忱来关心占人口一半的妇女的解放。
    之华同志特别提醒大家，不要重复过去工作中的官僚主义、强迫命令；要深入贫雇妇女中，和她们打成一片，倾听她们的意见，熟悉和了解她们的痛苦与要求。要具体的给她们解释土地法大纲，告诉她们妇女和男子同样分得一份土地，同样享受民主，鼓励她们的积极性。要启发她们追穷根，翻身诉苦，以便和地主富农分清界限，达到彻底翻身。土改以后，要注意组织妇女参加生产，特别是农业和纺织业。要训练她们各种生产技能，和阶级斗争的知识。各种支前工作，需要更好的组织妇女参加。
    之华同志说：各级领导机关，应有计划的培养提拔贫雇妇女和女工积极分子到各种领导岗位上来。要耐心的帮助她们解决各种困难，训练她们的办事能力。知识分子的女干部，应深入到农村中去，参加下层实际工作。使自己能在伟大的土地改革运动中得到群众的教育、改造，作一个善于为人民服务的长工。对于个别的不求进步的妇女干部，各级领导机关加以督促、教育、斗争，不能采取自由主义的态度。
    最后，之华同志告诉大家：我们的妇女工作，必需在党的总任务之下，结合各部门工作布置，同时对于妇女工作，必须具备信心。全国土地会议产生了一个打破几千年历史封建制度的大宪章——中国土地法大纲，这是战胜敌人最有力的武器，我们有了这个武器，就应该有不动摇的胜利信心。我们号召占人口半数的被压迫妇女积极起来拥护中国土地法。
