    Does everyone remember when our General Liu Bocheng led a large army across the Yellow River last July? Afterwards, they fought all the way to the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, established large new liberated areas, helped poor peasants to turn over, carried out land and grain distribution, expanded the ranks, and organized militia. Chiang Kai-shek was terrified when he saw this and hurriedly scraped together some broken-down troops to "sweep" them up. In the past twenty days, they have been battered by General Liu Bocheng's troops, eliminating more than 1,800 of them and capturing fourteen county towns in one go. General Liu Bocheng said it well: "Old Chiang can't take care of both his head and his feet; in the end, both his head and feet will be beaten."
    In Guangdong and Guangxi, our country's southernmost provinces, the people have risen up against Chiang Kai-shek. Now, with over 100,000 guns, they have occupied more than 100 counties and are fighting guerrilla warfare against Chiang Kai-shek's troops, distributing land and grain, keeping Chiang Kai-shek in check.
    Last year, our Northeast Army eliminated 280,000 enemies. Chairman Mao sent them a telegram, urging them to redouble their efforts and wipe out the enemies in the Northeast completely. In the past seven days, they have captured three more county towns and even captured a deputy division commander alive.

    大家都还记不记，去年七月，咱刘伯承将军不是领上大军，打过黄河了吗？以后他们一直打到了河南、湖北、安徽三省，建立了大块新解放区，到处帮贫苦农民翻身，闹分田分粮，扩大队伍，组织民兵，蒋介石看见了，害怕得不行，急忙凑了些破队伍来扫荡，二十天来，被咱刘怕承将军的部队打毛了，消灭他一千八百多，一气打下十四座县城。刘伯承将军说得好：“老蒋顾头顾不得脚，到后来，头和脚都得挨打。”
    我国最南边广东、广西两省老百姓，都起来反对蒋介石，现在有十多万支枪、占下了一百多个县，和老蒋军队打游击，分田分粮，把老蒋制得不轻。
    关东咱军队去年一年消灭敌人二十八万人，毛主席打电报给他们，叫他们加劲，把关东的敌人消灭干净。七天来，他们又打下了三座县城，还活捉了个副师长。
