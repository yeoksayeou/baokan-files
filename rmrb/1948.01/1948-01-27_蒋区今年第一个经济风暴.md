Title: Chiang Area's First Economic Storm of the Year

Xinhua News Agency short commentary:

　　In the first ten days of January 1948, major cities in the Chiang-controlled areas experienced a new round of skyrocketing prices, with Shanghai, the economic center of the Chiang bandits, seeing the most intense price increases. Taking the price of rice in Shanghai as an example, it was 1 million yuan per shi (a unit of dry volume, approx. 100 litres) on January 2nd, but soared to 1.58 million yuan just a week later, an increase of about 60%. The U.S. dollar exchange rate surged to 220,000 yuan on the 8th, and other commodities and the stock market also saw prices skyrocket. The Associated Press recognized this as the most severe surge since the gold rush in February of last year. The Chiang currency plummeted, and some Shanghai merchants were raising prices overnight but still couldn't keep up with the pace of inflation. Some simply closed their doors temporarily, refusing to sell goods.

　　This economic storm is just beginning. Although the tyrannical suppression by Chiang's economic agents around the 10th caused a small price correction, the direct and main factor causing this economic storm – a new and huge wave of malignant inflation – is playing and will continue to play a huge role. 100,000 yuan banknotes appeared in Chiang-controlled cities in the New Year of 1948, causing prices to soar as if by magic. More and more banknotes will be thrown into the Chiang-controlled market like a tide in the ocean. Another bigger demon is the threat of the Chiang bandits issuing new currency. The bandits have openly promoted that new currency will be issued, which means that tens of trillions of "legal tender" will depreciate by hundreds or thousands of times. The people in the Chiang-controlled areas will inevitably rush to buy goods with "legal tender," and prices will inevitably rise further.

　　Another important factor, and this factor will play an even more decisive role, is Chiang Kai-shek's military defeat. In Manchuria, North China, and even most of the rural areas of Central China, the Chiang currency can no longer be used. The Chiang currency that was originally concentrated in the cities of these areas has also largely fled to Shanghai and a few large cities in South China. Based on the increasing panic of the Chiang family bandits, these funds will inevitably engage in commercial speculation, powerfully accelerating the rise in prices.

　　The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's economic crisis has reached the point of collapse. A large number of the bandit gang members feel that the end is near, and the day of the Chiang bandits' demise is not far off. Therefore, everyone is taking advantage of the situation, muddying the waters, and making plans for failure. Even during the short period when the Chiang bandits implemented suppression, they couldn't wait to hide for a few days and rushed to engage in black market transactions. Therefore, among the more than 100 black market traders arrested by Chiang's Shanghai economic agents in early January, many were "responsible personnel" of the bandit gang.

　　During these three economic crises, the four major families, on the one hand, sent large compradors such as Bei Zuyi to the United States to beg for larger loans, and on the other hand, were determined to more cruelly plunder the small and medium-sized bourgeoisie and the broad masses of the people. In addition to preparing to issue new currency, this barbaric step, the bandit gang is also using high-interest loan policies to annex small and medium-sized industries, making them more directly enslaved by the four major families. During the price surge in November of last year, the four major families adopted a policy of suspending loans and restricting remittances. In early December, they also established a Gold Control Bureau, specifically restricting the activities of general banks and money shops, which put many small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises in a state of near bankruptcy during the critical juncture of the end of the year. After the economic storm re-emerged in January of this year, the Chiang bandit government used this difficulty to annex these small and medium-sized factories, stipulating that all textile, food, leather, cooking oil, sugar, fuel, and salt factories must hand over their products to the bandit government at official prices in the future, and then they could obtain loans from the four major banks controlled by the four major families.

　　The more the Chiang bandit gang approaches its death, the more shameless and brutal its face becomes, and it is now fully exposed. The broad masses of the people and the small and medium-sized bourgeoisie in the Chiang-controlled areas can only save themselves by uniting more closely and fighting against the Chiang bandit gang.

　　蒋区今年第一个经济风暴
    新华社短评
    一九四八年第一个月头十天，蒋管区各大城市发生新的物价狂涨，尤以蒋匪经济中心的上海涨风更烈。以上海米价为例，一月二日每石一百万元，仅仅一周之后，暴涨至一百五十八万元，即约涨百分之六十；美金票市八日曾突涨至二十二万元，其他物品及股票市场亦莫不飞涨。合众社认此为去年二月黄金风潮以后最厉害的一次。蒋币暴跌，上海商人有的连夜提高定价还赶不上物价上涨的速度，有的干脆暂时关门，拒售货物。
    这一经济风暴正在开始，虽然在十日左右蒋匪经济特务横蛮的镇压，曾使物价有小小的回跌，但造成这次经济风暴的直接的主要因素——新的巨大的恶性通货膨胀，正在而且更将起着巨大的作用。十万元大钞在一九四八年新年出现在蒋区各城市，使物价就象着了魔地向前飞跑。更多的大钞将如大海中的潮水一样被抛入蒋区市场。另外一个更大的魔鬼是蒋匪将发行新货币的威胁，匪帮已公开宣传新货币势将发行，这就是说几十万亿的“法币”将要千百倍的跌价，蒋区人民必然争先恐后地以“法币”竞购货物，物价必然更加上涨。
    另一个重要的因素，而且这个因素将更加起着决定作用，是蒋介石的军事失败。满洲、华北乃至华中绝大部分农村已经不能使用蒋币，而原来集中于这些地区城市中的蒋币也大量逃向上海与华南少数大城市，在蒋家匪帮更加恐慌的基础上，这些资金也必然从事商业投机，有力的加速物价的上涨。
    蒋介石匪帮的经济危机已到虚脱的程度，大批匪帮人员都感到日暮途穷，蒋匪灭亡之日不远，于是大家趁火打劫，混水摸鱼，作失败的打算。就是在蒋匪实行镇压的短时期内，也等不及躲避几天，抢着作黑市买卖，所以蒋匪上海经济特务在一月上旬中所拘捕的黑市交易者一百余人中，其中有许多就是匪帮“负责人员”。
    四大家族在这三次经济危机中一面是派贝祖诒等大买办去美国哀求更大的贷款，一面是决心更残酷的掠夺中小资产阶级与广大人民。除了准备发行新币这一野蛮步骤外，匪帮更利用高利贷的贷款政策并吞中小工业，使之更直接为四大家族所奴役。去年十一月物价狂涨时，四大家族采取了停止贷款与限制汇兑的政策，十二月初并成立了金管局，专门限制一般银行钱庄的活动，这就使得许多中小工商业在去年年关紧急关头中陷于濒于破产的局面。而今年一月的经济风暴再起之后，蒋匪政府却利用这个困难进行吞并这些中小工厂，规定所有纺织、食品、皮革、食油、糖、燃料、食盐等工厂今后均须将生产品按官价交给匪帮政府，然后可以得四大家族控制下之四大银行之贷款。
    蒋匪帮在愈近死亡时，愈加无耻与残暴的面貌，现已暴露无遗。蒋区广大人民与中小资产阶级要想自救，只有更加团结对蒋匪帮进行斗争。
