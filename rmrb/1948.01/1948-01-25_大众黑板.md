    Our Northeast China (Guandong) troops recently fought another beautiful and victorious battle outside Shenyang. They destroyed two entire Nationalist divisions, routed more than ten of their divisions, and eliminated a total of over 20,000 enemy soldiers. We also captured four division commanders and four regimental commanders. The captured weapons and artillery were simply too numerous to count. This is the third major victory for our Northeast China troops since the start of the winter counter-offensive. The Chiang bandits have been completely beaten by our powerful forces and have shrunk into isolated cities such as Changchun, Siping, and Shenyang, unable to move at all. That Northeast China area is four times the size of our Border Region, and now most of that area is in our hands. There are also more than 10,000 li of railways, which are managed by our democratic government. This year, our Northeast China troops will completely wipe out those Chiang bandits entrenched in the cities and send a large army into the interior to help our internal troops fight the Chiang bandits together. Northeast China has become the general rear area for our great counter-offensive.
    In the north of our Border Region, the troops led by Commander Nie recently fought fiercely against Fu Zuoyi's bandit army in the area near Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding. In the Battle of Laishui County alone, more than 3,000 of Fu's bandit main force were wiped out, and a division commander was also killed. The four railways that the Chiang bandits relied on for transporting troops and supplies were also completely destroyed by us in this operation. The transportation to the cities occupied by the Chiang bandits, such as Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding, has been completely cut off. The Chiang bandits hiding in the cities are terrified and panicking.

    咱们关东的队伍，前几天又在沈阳城外打了一个漂亮的大胜仗，毁了蒋军两个整师，打垮他十多个师，一共消灭了两万来人。还活捉了四个师长和四个团长，缴获的枪炮简直数不清楚。这是咱们关东队伍今冬大反攻以来的第三次大胜利。蒋匪完全被咱们强大的队伍打得缩在长春、四平、沈阳几个孤城里，一点动弹不得。提起那关东地方有咱边区四个那样大，现在那带地方大部分都在咱们手里了，还有一万多里长的铁路，也由咱们民主政府管理起来，在今年内咱们关东部队，就要把那些守在城里的蒋匪，完全干掉，把大军开进关来帮助咱们关内部队，一齐打蒋匪。关东已经成了咱们大反攻的总后方了。
    在咱边区的北面，聂司令率领的队伍，前几天也在北平、天津、保定附近一带把傅作义匪军打得人仰马翻。光涞水县一仗，傅匪主力就被消灭掉三千多人，师长也给打死了，蒋匪靠着运兵运粮的四条铁路，也在这次作战中，彻底被咱们破毁。北平、天津、保定这些蒋匪占着的城市交通都完全切断了，缩在城里的蒋匪，吓得恐慌得不行。
