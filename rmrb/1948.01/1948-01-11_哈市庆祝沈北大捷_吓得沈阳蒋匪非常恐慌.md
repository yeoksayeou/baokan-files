Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th: Representatives from various organizations and groups in Harbin celebrated the great victory of completely annihilating one army headquarters and two full divisions of Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the northern Shenyang area of Gongzhutun at the Zhaolin Cinema on the evening of the 7th. General Liu Yalou, Chief of Staff of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, reported on the victory. In an extremely excited tone, he first explained that since the winter offensive began on December 15th, the bandit leader Chen Cheng had been thrown into a panic. In the past, Chiang Kai-shek bandits would defend cities with a battalion or a regiment, but now they had to use a division or an army to defend them, but still could not avoid the fate of being wiped out. He then described how recently Chiang Kai-shek bandits concentrated 20 divisions of troops between Shenyang, Xinmin, and Faku, attempting to struggle desperately, but were finally annihilated by us in one fell swoop, eliminating two full divisions and one army headquarters. Although there were as many as seven divisions in nearby units, only 20 li away, they only shrank back and dared not provide assistance. General Liu's speech was often interrupted by applause. Finally, the conference unanimously passed a telegram to the front-line soldiers expressing their respect. The congratulatory telegram stated briefly: We will continue to strengthen various tasks in the rear, redoubling our efforts to fully support the front line, and work together under the central government's call to "strive for the complete liberation of the Northeast."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: According to Tianjin newspaper reports: Under the powerful winter offensive of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Shenyang are extremely panicked, and prices are soaring. At the end of last month, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities used five military aircraft to airlift a small number of senior officials and their families to escape. Sun Yueqi, the Vice Chairman of the Chiang Kai-shek Resources Committee and a watchdog of the Four Big Families, was still in a state of panic when he fled from Shenyang to Beiping. He confessed, "The so-called dismantling of industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast has become a thing of the past. People can't even be evacuated, let alone machines?" The morale and prices in Shenyang City also fluctuated greatly. In just one or two days, rice rose from 60,000 yuan per jin of Chiang Kai-shek currency to 90,000 yuan (that is, 9 million yuan per dan), and sorghum rice rose from 38,000 yuan per jin to more than 45,000 yuan. Rice looting is becoming increasingly fierce. On the 21st of last month, when a rice truck passed through the urban area, hundreds of elderly, weak, women and children swarmed up and snatched 44 bags. Those who took risks at night were active everywhere.

　　哈市庆祝沈北大捷
  　吓得沈阳蒋匪非常恐慌
    【新华社东北九日电】哈尔滨市各机关团体代表七日晚在兆麟电影院庆祝沈北公主屯全部歼灭蒋匪一个军部两个整师的大捷。东北解放军参谋长刘亚楼将军报告胜利经过。他以极其兴奋口吻首先说明十二月十五日冬季攻势开始后，打得匪首陈诚张惶失措。过去蒋匪以一个营一个团守卫城市，现在则要用一个师一个军来守卫，但仍不能避免覆灭命运。随即叙述最近蒋匪以廿个师兵力，集中在沈阳、新民、法库之间，妄图拼死挣扎，终于仍被我一举歼灭其两个整师和一个军部，而在邻近部队虽有七个师之多，相距只有廿里，却只是向后龟缩，不敢援救。刘参谋长讲话时，常被掌声打断。最后大会一致通过致电前线将士表示敬意。贺电略称：我们将继续加强后方各种工作，百倍紧张起来，以全力支援前线，在中央“为完全解放东北而奋斗”的号召下，共同努力。
    【新华社陕北九日电】据津报消息：在东北人民解放军强大冬季攻势下，沈阳蒋匪极度恐慌，物价猛烈上涨。上月底一天之间蒋匪当局即以五架军用机空运少数高级官员及眷属逃跑。四大家族看家狗蒋匪资委会副委员长孙越崎自沈逃抵北平时，犹惊惶不已。供称“所谓东北拆迁工矿问题已成过去，人都撤不出来，还谈得上机器？”沈市人心物价亦随之大动，仅一、二日之间大米即由蒋币每斤六万元涨至九万元（即每担合九百万元），高粱米每斤由三万八千元涨至四万五千余元。抢米风潮日益炽盛，上月二十一日有米车经过市区，百余老弱妇孺即蜂拥而上，抢去四十四包，夜间挺而走险者四出活动。
