    In the past year, our border region's soldiers fought Chiang Kai-shek to protect our people's liberation and won many great victories. We killed or captured over 290,000 enemies. Chiang Kai-shek's army was only about two million strong, and our border region alone wiped out one-tenth of them. Among these 290,000 people were 35 generals and over 7,200 officers. If we organized these officers, we could form two brigades.
    Our army captured 90 county towns in the past year, almost equivalent to an entire Shanxi province. We seized more than 2,800 artillery pieces, over 9,400 machine guns, and over 100,000 rifles and short guns. With these weapons, we could establish more than ten divisions.
    When Chiang Kai-shek first started the civil war, he was attacking our liberated areas, and the fighting often took place in the liberated areas. Last year, the war situation changed. We wiped out Chiang Kai-shek's troops who invaded the liberated areas, and our troops fought their way into his old nest. It's like climbing a mountain; we reached the top and knocked Chiang Kai-shek down from the top. He's rolling lower and lower, and he'll fall to his death eventually. Our Liu-Deng army has already fought its way to Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, and established new liberated areas in the Dabie Mountains. The Chen-Xie army has already fought its way to Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi, and established new liberated areas in the Funiu Mountains. We are on the offensive, Chiang Kai-shek is on the run, and the day of Chiang Kai-shek's demise is near.

    去年一年，咱们边区子弟兵打蒋介石，保护咱老百姓翻身，打了好多大胜仗。打死的、活捉的敌人有二十九万多人。蒋介石的队伍不过有二百来万，光咱们边区，十停就干掉了他一停。这二十九万人里边，有三十五个将官，七千二百多个军官，把这些军官编起来，就能编成两个旅。
    咱们的军队去年一年打下了九十个县城，差不多顶一个山西省。咱们缴获了两千八百多门炮，九千四百多挺机关枪，十万多支长短枪，用这些武器，能成立十好几个师。
    蒋介石才打起内战，是向咱们解放区进攻，打仗的地方常常在解放区。去年的战事变了，咱们把蒋介石打进解放区的队伍消灭掉，咱们的队伍打到他的老窝去了。好比爬山，咱们上到山顶上，把蒋介石从山顶上打下去，越滚越低，摔死拉倒。咱们的刘邓大军，已经打到湖北、河南、安徽，在大别山建立了新解放区。陈谢大军已经打到河南、湖北、陕西，在伏牛山建立了新解放区。咱们是进攻，蒋介石是逃跑，蒋介石完蛋的日子快了。
