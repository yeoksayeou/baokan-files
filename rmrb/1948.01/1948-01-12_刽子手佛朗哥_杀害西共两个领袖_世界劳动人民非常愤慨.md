Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Reports from various sources: Underground Spanish Communist leaders Zorroza and Núñez were recently executed by the Spanish executioner Franco. Upon hearing the tragic news, the world's working people expressed their indignation and offered their condolences. On the 3rd, Parisians participated in a demonstration in front of the Spanish Embassy initiated by the National Committee of the Franco-Spanish Association. The Central Bureau of the General Confederation of Labor in France paid tribute to martyrs like Zorroza. The British Communist Party's Worker's Daily editorial, in addition to denouncing the atrocities of Franco, supported by the US and Britain, stated: "The Spanish people's guerrilla war against the despicable dictatorship is expanding, and they will fight until they win the final victory." Labor MP Blitte stated in a New Year's Day speech: "Bevin has repeatedly stated that he hates the Franco regime, but this regime seems to be even more rampant because of his hatred, and he is not even willing to informally intervene in the matter of Zorroza, which is shameful." The Hungarian Social Democratic Party's newspaper "Népszava" also protested the deaths of Zorroza and others and paid tribute to them. It is reported that before Zorroza and others were sentenced to death by Franco's bandits, the working people and democrats of various countries had protested and called for rescue, but Franco's bandits took swift measures to execute them, and after the execution, they threw their bodies into the garbage dump in the prison, which shows their ferocity and brutality.

    【新华社陕北九日电】各方讯：西共地下工作领袖左罗亚及努涅茨，最近被西班牙刽子手佛朗哥处死。噩耗传来，世界劳动人民咸表愤慨与同声哀悼。三日，巴黎人民参加了法西协会全国委员会发起的在西大使馆前的示威。法总工会中央局则遥向左罗亚等烈士致敬。英共工人日报社论除痛斥为美英支持的佛朗哥的暴行外，并为称：“西人民反对卑劣独裁的游击战争正在扩大中，他们将一直作战到赢得最后胜利为止”。工党议员布黎特元旦演说称：“贝文一再声称他痛恨佛朗哥政权，但这政权似乎由于他的痛恨还更猖獗了，他甚至都不愿非正式地干涉一下左罗亚的事情，这是可耻的”。匈社会民主党机关报“涅普·斯查瓦”亦抗议左罗亚等之蒙难，并向其致敬。按左罗亚等在被佛朗哥匪徒判处死刑前，世界各国劳动人民及民主人士曾提出抗议并呼号营救，但佛朗哥匪徒竟采取了迅速处死的措施，处死后且将其尸体抛到狱中垃圾堆里，其凶恶残暴可见。
