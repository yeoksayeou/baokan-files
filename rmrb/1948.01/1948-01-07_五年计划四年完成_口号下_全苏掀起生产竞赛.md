　　“五年计划四年完成”口号下
  　全苏掀起生产竞赛
    【新华社陕北四日电】综合报导：当一九四八年新年来临之际，四年完成五年计划的社会主义大竞赛，业已席卷全苏。莫斯科莫洛瓦哥尔、喀拉干达三个煤矿托拉斯向斯大林保证五年计划四年完成。真理报和消息报社论指出：矿工们所提出的保证，对于全苏国民经济有重大的意义。拉脱维亚工人给斯大林的信中保证，争取四年完成五年计划。其中刻夫电气化学工厂，萨卡舟加瓦玻璃工厂及其他许多工厂，更保证三年完成五年计划。一个制造电力站装备的最大工厂的经理说：我们工厂已建起了蒸气涡轮和水力涡轮，使在四年内完成五年计划极为可能。全苏职工会委员会全体会议决定，缔结经理部与职工会之间的一九四八年新合同，内有特别条款，即进一步改良安全设备，在工人中展开发明运动，以大大提高生产力。
