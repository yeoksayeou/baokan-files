　　Pingding Inspects Production in Disaster Areas
  　Provides Loans to Help Poor Laborers
    [Pingding News] In mid-December, the Pingding County government conducted in-depth inspections of production work in the severely disaster-stricken areas of Xibaian, Chaoyangpo, and Dongxisuohuang villages. It was found that the most serious problem in these areas was that some district and village cadres were satisfied with the lively actions and preliminary achievements of the masses who had labor and tools, neglecting the interests of the poor laborers and failing to pay attention to solving their production difficulties. For example, in Chaoyangpo, District 2, out of 161 full and semi-auxiliary male laborers and 20 donkeys in the whole village, except for 19 people who were unable to work due to illness, all others had taken action in various production lines. However, only six of the 28 small carts belonged to the poor laborers, and the remaining 22 belonged to the middle peasants and above. Only six of the 20 donkeys belonged to the poor laborers. In transportation production, the middle peasants and above could use carts (each cart can carry more than 300 catties) and donkeys (each donkey can carry 150-160 catties) to earn big profits, while most of the poor laborers lacked transportation tools and donkeys, relying only on human labor (each person carrying 60 catties), exerting great effort but earning small profits. Another example is Xibaian, District 1, where 20 donkeys were still idle, these animals were the fruits distributed to the poor laborers, and because the problem of communal feeding was not resolved, they could not work due to mutual constraints. However, the cadres in these villages said, "It's not a problem anymore," "Everyone is taking action."

    The county studied this problem and has instructed all districts to immediately overcome complacency, conduct in-depth inspections, implement the poor laborers' class line, and solve the difficulties of the poor laborers in textile, transportation production, and iron industry development. First, 550 shi of millet will be issued as loans for textile and transportation, specifically to support the poor laborers in severely disaster-stricken areas to solve the difficulties of looms and transportation tools. Develop 600 to 1,000 looms and 500 to 600 large and small transportation carts. (Liang Shengtian)

　　平定检查灾区生产
  　贷粮帮助贫雇
    【平定消息】平定县府在上月中旬，深入检查了严重灾荒地区西白岸、朝阳坡、东西锁簧等村的生产工作。发现这些地区，在生产上最严重的问题是有些区村干部满足了有劳力有工具群众的热闹行动与初步成绩，忽视贫雇群众的利益，没有注意解决他们的生产困难。如二区朝阳坡全村一百六十一个全半辅助男劳力，廿个毛驴，除了十九人因病未动，别的已全部从各种生产行道上行动起来。但二十八辆小车中只有贫雇群众的六辆，剩下的二十二辆，都是中农以上阶层的。二十头毛驴中也只有贫雇群众的六头。在运输生产上，中农以上阶层可用车推（每车能推三百多斤）、驴驮（每驴可驮一百五六十斤）赚大利，大部贫雇缺乏运输工具与毛驴，只靠人力担挑（每人担六十斤）出力大获利小。又如一区西白岸全村牲口中还有二十头毛驴没有动，这些牲口都是贫雇分到的果实，因伙喂的问题没解决，相互牵扯不能干，但是这些村里的干部却说：“不成问题了”，“都动起来啦”。
    县里研究了这个问题，已经指示各区，立即克服自满思想，深入检查，贯彻贫雇阶级路线，解决贫雇纺织、运输生产与铁业发展等困难。先发放纺织运输贷粮小米五百五十石，专门扶植严重灾荒区贫雇群众解决织机与运输工具的困难。发展织布机六百架至一千架，大小运输车五百至六百辆。（梁生天）
