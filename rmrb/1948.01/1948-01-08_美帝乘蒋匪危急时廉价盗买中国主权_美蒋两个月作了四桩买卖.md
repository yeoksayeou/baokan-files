Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Dispatch: Moscow Radio broadcast on the 12th of last month a commentary by Massino criticizing Chiang Kai-shek for signing four traitorous agreements with U.S. imperialism within two months. It pointed out that U.S. imperialism is taking advantage of Chiang Kai-shek's weak and pitiable situation to plunder a large amount of the Chinese people's rights and interests from Chiang Kai-shek at extremely low prices. The original text stated:

　　In two months, the Kuomintang reactionaries signed four agreements with U.S. imperialism selling out Chinese sovereignty. The first agreement was on October 17th, when the Kuomintang, in the form of a note, formally notified the United States that it agreed to the stationing of U.S. troops in China. This document confirms that the United States has its own armed forces in China (that is, has the right to establish military bases within China), using force to turn China into a U.S. military base.

　　On October 27th, the so-called Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement was signed. This agreement allows the United States to supervise the use of "Aid-China funds" and materials, supervise the manufacturing of Chinese and other countries' imported goods, and control the use of the funds obtained from selling these goods. In reality, this gives the U.S. imperialism all the economic and domestic and foreign trade administrative power of the Kuomintang-controlled areas.

　　The third agreement was signed on November 10th, and it is formally called the "U.S. Educational Foundation in China Agreement." It stipulates that the United States can establish specialized educational institutions in China. This is effectively handing over China's educational and cultural sovereignty to the United States.

　　In four weeks, the Kuomintang sold out the Chinese people's rights and interests in many aspects to U.S. imperialism. This is because the four major families believe that American aid is the only hope to delay their demise. They are prepared to sell everything for this. The greed of the U.S. imperialists increases as the foundation of the Kuomintang reactionaries becomes increasingly shaken, while the dollars given to their lackeys are decreasing. They are taking advantage of the Kuomintang's weak and pitiable position in order to obtain more practical benefits at a low price. The American bankers used this purely usurious method to force the Kuomintang reactionaries to sign three agreements in a few weeks, while actually only paying 27.7 million U.S. dollars. What a profitable deal! Moreover, this money was not paid in U.S. dollars but in grain. The use of the grain and the funds obtained from its sale are still subject to U.S. supervision.

　　Not long ago, the United States promised to give the Kuomintang a large amount of loans. Now, as the Kuomintang's reactionary situation worsens, the United States has reduced its promise to a so-called emergency aid of 60 million U.S. dollars (Xinhua News Agency note: According to a Washington dispatch from the U.S. Information Service on the 19th, the U.S. Congress passed a reduction to 18 million U.S. dollars) and broad aid of 300 million U.S. dollars. Based on these constantly declining conditions, new enslaving treaties are being negotiated simultaneously in Nanjing and Washington. According to the Nanjing Evening News on November 21st, the content of this negotiation is very extensive. Regarding the issue of attitude towards the international situation, the Kuomintang and the U.S. government have reached further "mutual understanding."

　　The first result of this negotiation was the "Sino-U.S. Naval Agreement" formally announced on December 8th – the fourth treaty enslaving China signed in two months. The first part of the agreement stipulates that the United States will hand over 140 warships to the Kuomintang (in fact, 100 of them have already been handed over to the Kuomintang). It seems that this agreement does not offer anything new. The role of the United States in signing this agreement lies in the second part. The second part stipulates that in order to establish the Kuomintang's naval organization, the United States will help it train cadres, while the Kuomintang will provide the United States with naval intelligence. In other words, the United States has obtained the right to supervise the Kuomintang's naval fleet and cadres, and has obtained the right to establish naval bases in China. While establishing training bases for the Kuomintang Navy, the United States can establish its own bases. This agreement is an extension of the U.S. military's formal stationing agreement in China announced on October 17th. Combined, these two agreements mean that the Kuomintang's armed forces are completely Americanized, turning them into a tool of U.S. imperialism.

　　U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries are still preparing many other treaties to enslave the Chinese people. On December 8th, the day the "Sino-U.S. Naval Agreement" was signed, the Shanghai Shen Bao said that the Kuomintang Central Political Conference discussed how to obtain American trust and sympathy, as well as massive aid. This means that the Kuomintang is prepared for a new sell-out of the vital interests of the Chinese people.

### 美帝乘蒋匪危急时廉价盗买中国主权  美蒋两个月作了四桩买卖

　　美帝乘蒋匪危急时廉价盗买中国主权
    美蒋两个月作了四桩买卖
    【新华社陕北电】莫斯科电台上月十二日广播马西努评论蒋匪两个月内与美帝国主义签订了四个卖国协定。指出美帝国主义正乘蒋介石危弱可怜的处境，以极低廉代价从蒋匪手中掠夺中国人民大量权益。原文称：
    两个月来国民党反动派与美帝国主义签订了四个出卖中国主权的协定。第一个协定是十月十七日国民党用照会形式，正式通知美国同意美军留驻中国。这个文件证实美国在中国拥有自己的武装力量（也就是有权力在中国境内建立军事根据地），以武力把中国变成美国的军事根据地。
    十月二十七日又签订了所谓中美救济协定。这个协定容许美国监督“援华基金”及物资的利用，监管中国制造及其他国家输入的物资，及管制出卖这些物资所得到的款项的利用。这实际上是把国民党统治区全部经济及其对内对外贸易行政权，让给美帝国主义。
    第三个协定是十一月十日签订的，它在形式上叫做“美国在华教育基金协定”。它规定美国在中国可以建立专门教育机关。这实际上是把中国的教育及文化主权送给了美国。
    在四个星期内，国民党把中国人民多方面的权益都出卖给美帝国主义。这是由于四大家族认为美国的援助是延缓他们灭亡的唯一希望。他们为此已准备出卖一切。美帝国主义者的贪欲，随着国民党反动派根基的日益动摇而增高，同时发给其走狗的美金却日益减少。他们利用国民党处在危弱可怜的地位，以便以低廉的代价，取得更多的实际利益。美国银行家用这种纯粹高利贷的手腕，逼使国民党反动派在几个星期内签订了三个协定，而自己实际上只支付了二千七百七十万美元。这是多么有利的买卖啊！而且这笔款他们并不是用美金而是用粮食支付的。粮食的利用及买卖所得的款项还得受美国监督。
    不久以前，美国答应给国民党大量的贷款，现在当国民党反动情况更加恶劣时，美国把自己的诺言减到所谓紧急援助六千万美元（新华社按：据美新闻处华盛顿十九日电称：美国会通过削减为一千八百万美元）和广泛援助的三万万美元。根据这些不断下降的条件，在南京与华盛顿两地正同时开始了新的奴役条约的谈判。据十一月二十一日南京晚报透露：这个谈判所包括的内容是非常广泛的，关于对于国际时局态度问题，国民党与美国政府之间达到了进一步的“相互谅解”。
    这个谈判的第一个结果，是十二月八日正式宣布的“中美海军协定”——这是两个月内签订的第四个奴役中国的条约。协定中第一部分规定美国以一百四十艘舰船交给国民党（其实其中的一百艘早就交给国民党了）。这样看来，这一协定并没有给出什么新的东西，美国签订这个协定的作用是在第二部分。第二部分规定：为了建立国民党海军机构，美国帮助它培养干部，国民党则供给美国以海军的情报。换句话说：美国得到了对国民党海军舰队和干部的监督权，并取得在中国建立海军根据地的权利。在建立训练国民党海军基地的同时，美国就可以建立自己的根据地了。这个协定是十月十七日所公布的美军正式驻华协定的扩大。这两个协定综合起来，是国民党武装完全美国化，把它变成美帝国主义的工具。
    美帝国主义和国民党反动派，还在准备其他许多奴役中国人民的条约。十二月八日，就是在“中美海军协定”签订的那一天，上海申报说：在国民党中央政治会议上，讨论了怎样获得美国的信任与同情以及大量援助的问题。这就是说国民党已准备着对中国人民切身利益的新出卖。
