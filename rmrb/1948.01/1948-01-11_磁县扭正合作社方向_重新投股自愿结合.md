　　Ci County Corrects Cooperative Direction
　　Re-Investment and Voluntary Combination
　　[Ci County News] In order to promote winter production, Chengguan First District convened an expanded meeting of cooperative cadres and main village cadres from the entire district to inspect the cooperatives. It was found that most cooperatives were funded by the masses' fruit money, not shares collected from the masses. Some cooperatives were established without consulting the masses at all, and some villages even established them by issuing notices and allocating funds. For example, Xingren Street was decided by cadres that each household would contribute 2,000 yuan to invest in the cooperative, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses, who compared our cooperative to the enemy's cooperative. In Xicheng Street: a towel factory was established with farmers' association funds during last year's struggle. One of the cadres was a bankrupt landlord, and the other was a normal school graduate (from a bankrupt rich peasant family). This summer, they sat in the shop every day, drinking tea, wearing foreign cloth clothes, flaunting their power like big capitalists. The masses were dissatisfied with the cooperative, but they did not express any opinions. After the masses investigated their class status, they were completely squeezed out. The cooperative's funds were distributed to the masses, re-investment and voluntary combination were carried out, and the hired poor Zhang Lianfang and Director Li were supported to take power themselves. The Puyang Street cooperative was found to have a purely profit-seeking viewpoint, resulting in losses and failing to meet the actual needs of the masses, thus becoming detached from the masses. After review, the funds were resolutely distributed to the masses, re-investment was carried out, the direction was corrected, and the focus was shifted to the poor and hired laborers. When the masses were pushing soil but had no brooms, the cooperative bought one. Siqian Street: the cooperative grasped the needs of the masses and organized a flower shop, organizing more than a hundred of the masses' carts to buy flowers and sell Jiazi flowers. From this autumn to now, according to incomplete statistics, it has earned more than 10 million yuan in foreign currency. The masses are very satisfied with the cooperative. At this meeting, most comrades understood that the cooperative is the village's leading production organization for the masses, resolutely facing the poor and hired laborers, overcoming the past purely profit-seeking viewpoint, listening to the opinions of the masses, buying whatever the masses need, selling finished products, buying raw materials, and cultivating the poor and hired laborers to take power.

　　磁县扭正合作社方向
  　重新投股自愿结合
    【磁县消息】城关一区为了推动冬季生产，召开全区村合作社干部及村主要干部扩大会，检查大部合作社都是群众的果实款，并不是群众集的股，有的合作社根本没有和群众商量，有个别村是下通知派款方式成立的。如兴仁街是经干部决定每户拿二千元投到合作社，因而群众不满，拿敌人的合作社来比咱们的合作社。西城街：在去年斗争中拿农会款成立了个毛巾工厂，干部有一个是破落地主，一个是师范毕业生（家庭是破落富农），今夏时每天坐在门市部，喝茶叶水，穿的是洋布衣，耀武扬威，象个大资本家样子，群众对合作社不满，但是也不提意见。经过群众查阶级，把他们完全挤出去了。将社里款分给群众，重新投股自愿结合，并且扶植起雇贫张莲芳和李社长自己当权。滏阳街检查出合作社，存在单纯营利观点，结果赔了钱，没有结合群众实际要求，脱离了群众，经过检讨，把款坚决分给群众，重新投股，扭转方向，面向贫雇，群众推土没有扫帚，合作社就去买了一部。司前街：合作社抓住了群众要求，组织了个花店，把群众的车子百余辆都组织起来，收买花子，推销叫子花，今年秋后到现在据不完全统计，赚洋一千余万元，群众对合作社非常满意。在这个会上，大部同志知道了合作社，是村的领导群众生产机关，坚决面向贫雇，克服过去的单纯营利观点，要听取群众意见，群众要啥咱买啥，推销成品，买原料，培养雇贫掌权。
