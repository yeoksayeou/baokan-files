Xinhua News Agency, East China, 27th – In response to the incident of Zhao Jizhou, Commander of the Third Sub-district of Bohai, using armed force to suppress the peasant land reform movement and shooting peasant leaders, the East China Military Region has issued a special order to dismiss him from his post and investigate him. The order stated: Zhao Jizhou, as a sub-district commander, actually deserted his post, deceived his subordinates, stood on the side of the landlords, supported the feudal forces of his sister-in-law and brother-in-law, and shot Cao Meishu, the village party secretary (farmers' association chairman), and beat and bound up to twelve village cadres and members of the masses. This is completely a criminal act that violates the traditional spirit of revolutionary soldiers and is absolutely intolerable to our army. The People's Liberation Army represents the interests of 90% of the peasant masses in the countryside, implements land reform, and liberates the broad masses of peasants. The entire army, from top to bottom, should resolutely struggle for this goal. Zhao Jizhou failed to set an example by upholding the just demands of the peasants, but instead stood on the side of the landlord class, resulting in counter-revolutionary crimes. Therefore, he is hereby dismissed from his post and investigated to enforce discipline and warn against similar actions.

The Bohai District Party Committee, adhering to the orders of the East China Military Region and accepting the opinions of the masses, has also officially decided: 1. To remove Zhao Jizhou from his position as sub-district commander and immediately detain him. 2. To remove him from his position as a member of the District Committee and expel him from the Party. 3. To hand him over to Shenjiaying in Wei (County) North for the masses to handle.

Zhao Jizhou's counter-revolutionary facts are as follows: In early July of last year, when the situation in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway was tense, Zhao Jizhou was leading his troops in the Shouguang Second District defense area awaiting orders to attack. At that time, his brother-in-law – Shen Pingzhi, a major feudal tyrant from Shenjiaying in Wei (County) North – went to the army to find Zhao, telling him about the situation of his family and the family of Zhao's other sister-in-law – a traitorous and tyrannical figure in the same village – being liquidated and struggled against by the masses, and asked Zhao for help. After hearing this, Zhao immediately abandoned his military duties, deserted his post, and secretly led eleven cavalrymen to Shenjiaying overnight. Before entering the village, he deceived his subordinates by saying, "Tonight, we are going to capture special agents and underground lines," and drew up a list, specifically naming people to be arrested. He arrested a total of twelve people, including the village cadre, the head of the women's federation, the militia instructor, and staff members, and subjected them to all kinds of torture and insults. Cao Meishu, the village party secretary and farmers' association chairman (who also served as the director of the land reform committee of eight villages), a hired farmhand, was brutally beaten and shot to death by Zhao's cavalry, sacrificing heroically. After Cao's death, Zhao Jizhou also said, "Killing three or two is nothing," and finally forcibly escorted the village cadres and masses away from the village.

After Zhao Jizhou was dismissed from his post and investigated, the Bohai Daily published an editorial entitled "On Zhao Jizhou's Crimes and Our Attitude," first expressing a hundredfold concern for the family of the victimized peasant leader Comrade Cao Meishu and the masses of the village, and pointing out that Zhao Jizhou's actions of torturing the masses and village cadres, shooting the branch secretary, and suppressing the land reform movement were acts of treason against the Party and the people. He used the identity of a Communist Party member and commander, and the peasants' guns to suppress the peasants' struggle for liberation. This is an extremely vicious and heartbreaking thing. He is a traitor to the Party and the peasants. It further pointed out that we, the Communist Party members and revolutionary soldiers, should adopt a serious attitude towards Zhao Jizhou's crimes and should recognize that this is a question of revolution and counter-revolution. The discipline of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army is strict, and any action that violates the interests of the people cannot be tolerated, no matter how senior you are, how high your position is, or how great your "achievements" are. The editorial concluded: This incident tells us that only those who can resolutely sever ties with landlord families and feudal relatives can stand with the peasants; those who want to serve the landlord bullies and feudal forces and remain unrepentant will surely be spurned by the peasant masses and cause major crimes.

　　武装镇压农民翻身犯了大罪
  　渤海三分区司令员
  　赵寄舟被开除党籍
  　撤职查办交给群众处理
    【新华社华东二十七日电】华东军区为渤海三分区司令员赵寄舟，武装镇压农民土地改革运动，枪杀农民领袖事件，顷特通令将其撤职查办。通令提出：赵寄舟身为分区司令员，竟擅离阵地，欺骗部属，站在地主立场，替其姐丈妹夫封建势力撑腰，枪杀村支书（农会长）曹美枢，并捆打村干部群众达十二名，这完全是违反革命军人传统精神的犯罪行为，为我军所绝对不能容许的。解放军代表占农村百分之九十的农民群众的利益，实行土地改革，使广大农民得以解放，全军上下都应为此目标而坚决奋斗。赵寄舟不以身作则，坚持农民的正义要求，反而站在地主阶级立场，造成反革命罪行，为此特将其撤职查办，以申纪律而警效尤。
    渤海区党委秉承华东军区命令，及接受群众意见，亦正式决定：一、撤销赵寄舟之分区司令员职务，立即将其扣押。二、撤销其地委委员职务，并开除党籍。三、押交维（县）北沈家营，交群众处理。
    赵寄舟反革命事实如下：去年七月初旬，胶济路中段形势紧张时，赵寄舟正带领部队在寿光二区防地待令出击。当时其妹夫——维（县）北沈家营大封建恶霸沈平之曾至军中找赵，告诉他家和赵的另一姐丈家——同村之奸特恶霸——被群众清算斗争情形，要赵救援。赵听后马上放下军事任务不管，擅离职守，私带骑兵十一名，连夜赶到沈家营。进庄前以“今晚去捉特务地下线”欺骗部下，开列名单指名捉人，捉到该村村干妇救会长、民兵指导员及工作人员共十二人，给以百般拷打辱骂。该村支部书记兼农会长（并兼八个村翻身委员会主任）雇农曹美枢被赵之骑兵痛殴并被枪杀，惨烈牺牲。曹死后，赵寄舟还说：“打死三个两个算不了什么”，最后并将该村干部群众强押离村。
    赵寄舟被撤职查办后，渤海日报特以“论赵寄舟的犯罪和我们的态度”为题发表社论，首先对被害农民领袖曹美枢同志家属和该村群众寄以百倍关切，并指出：赵寄舟拷打群众村干、枪杀支书、镇压土地改革运动的行为是直接叛变党和人民的犯罪犯法行为。他以共产党员、司令员的身份，以农民的枪杆子镇压农民的翻身斗争，这是极端恶毒而又非常痛心的事，他是党与农民的叛徒。继指出：对于赵寄舟的犯罪，我们共产党人与革命军人应当采取严肃的态度，应认识这是革命与反革命的问题。共产党与人民解放军的纪律是严肃的，任何违犯人民利益的行动都不能容许，哪怕你资格再老、地位再高、“功绩”再大，都不能例外。社论最后说：这个事件告诉我们，谁能够坚决和地主家庭封建亲属斩断联系，谁才能够和农民站在一起；谁要为地主恶霸封建势力服务而又执迷不悟，那他就一定为农民群众所唾弃，而造成重大的罪恶。
