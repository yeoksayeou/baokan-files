　　Neiqiu Prepares to Implement the Land Law
　　Confiscates and Seals the Fruits of Struggle from Each Village
　　Forbids Selling and Transferring Property
　　[Neiqiu News] After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law of China, landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to try every means to sabotage it. Some people who had gained more fruits in the past also calculated their family property based on the average property per capita in the village. Finding that they had a surplus, they used the excuse of production difficulties and lack of production funds to sell livestock, trees, clothes, grain, furniture and other property to resist the Outline Land Law. After discovering this phenomenon, the Neiqiu County Government specifically issued three preventive measures, ordering all villages to strictly implement them:
　　1. All existing undistributed fruits of struggle in each village, whether property or cash, must be registered and sealed. Before the Outline Land Law is implemented, no individual is allowed to use them. If any incidents of sabotage or theft are discovered during or after the registration and sealing, they will be severely punished.
　　2. Before the Outline Land Law is implemented, no one is allowed to sell or transfer property (including houses, land, trees, timber, livestock, clothing, grain, bedding, furniture, etc.) and the previously distributed fruits of struggle. When poor peasants and laborers who have not yet turned themselves over lack firewood, grain, and grass, they should be adjusted and resolved through mutual borrowing within the village. Those who lack production capital and production tools will be resolved through loans from economic departments (cooperatives and banks). The property of cadres and activists who have already turned themselves over is not allowed to be sold, just like other members of the masses. The landlords and rich peasants shall be prevented from selling and transferring property according to the Commissioner's Office's Proclamation, and it shall be earnestly implemented.
　　3. Any bad elements found attempting to undermine the equal distribution of land shall be strictly dealt with in accordance with Articles 13 and 14 of the Outline Land Law and the regulations on punishing corruption in the border area. These laws and regulations should also be widely publicized in the winter schools in each village, and the masses should launch extensive research and discussion, telling anyone not to violate the laws, otherwise they will be punished by the people's court in the future. (Zhi'an, Zhenshan)
　　[Xingtai News] After the Outline Land Law was transmitted to Xingtai, landlords and rich peasants everywhere sabotaged and resisted it. A rich peasant from Dushu in the Tenth District ran to Songjiazhuang Town and sold the house there. The landlord of × village in the Eleventh District sold all the trees. The rich peasants and landlords in other villages are feasting and drinking heavily. Zhou Shien, a fugitive soldier from Nanliangshe in the Fourth District, whose family was being struggled against, and Lu Huanlin, a teacher who had been dismissed, organized gambling, luring village chiefs, peasant association chairmen and other cadres into the game, ignoring the production of the poor peasants and laborers, and gambling heavily in the cooperative. Lu Huanlin lost more than 80,000 yuan, and the chairman of the peasant association also lost more than 50,000 yuan. These things should be stopped immediately. (Zhengang, Changyan)

　　内邱准备实施土地法
  　封存各村斗争果实
    禁止变卖转移财物
    【内邱消息】中国土地法大纲公布后，地主富农乘机想尽各种方法进行破坏。也有一些过去得果实较多的人，以全村每口平均财产数来算自己的家当，发现长余，即借口生产困难及缺乏生产资金，变卖牲口、树木、衣服、粮食、家具等财物，抵抗土地法大纲。内邱县府发现这种现象后，特定出三点制止办法，命令各村严格执行：
    一、凡各村现存未分的斗争果实，无论财物钱款，一律进行登记封存，在未执行土地法大纲前，任何个人不准动用。在登记封存时或封存后，如发现捣鬼窃取情事，要予以严格处罚。
    二、在未执行土地法大纲以前，禁止任何人变卖转移财物（包括房屋、土地、树木、木材、牲口、衣物、粮食、被褥、家具等），与先前所分斗争果实。未翻透身之贫雇缺少柴禾粮草时，应在本村进行调剂，互借解决。缺乏生产资本、生产工具的，由经济部门（合作社银行）贷款解决。已翻透身的干部积极分子的财产，与其他群众一样不准变卖。对防止地主富农变卖转移财物，依专署布告认真执行。
    三、发现企图破坏土地平分的坏分子，要依土地法大纲第十三、十四两条与边区惩治贪污条例等法令严格处理。并要在各村冬学中普遍宣传这些法令，由群众展开广泛研究讨论，告诉任何人不要违犯法令，否则将来要受到人民法庭的处罚。（治安、振山）
    【邢台消息】土地法大纲传到邢台后，地主富农处处破坏抵抗。十区杜树一个富农跑到宋家庄镇把那里的房子卖了。十一区×村地主把树木都卖了。其他村富农地主都在大吃二喝。四区南良舍一个逃亡战士叫周仕恩，家庭是被斗户，他和撤了职的教员吕焕林组织赌博，把村长农会主席等干部都勾引上了套，放着贫雇生产不管，在合作社大赌起来。吕焕林输了八万余元，农会主席也输了五万多元。这些事情应该立刻制止。（振刚、昌言）
