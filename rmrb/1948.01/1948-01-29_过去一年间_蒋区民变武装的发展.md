　　Over the Past Year
  　The Development of Armed Popular Uprisings in the Chiang-Controlled Areas
    The people's power is as great as a mountain, and the revolting rakes are countless; rotten fish must rot from the inside out, black-hearted bosses, get out!
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Jiangnan Folk Song
    Over the past year, armed popular uprisings in the Chiang-controlled areas have developed rapidly. According to available statistics, the people's army is active in sixteen provinces and more than four hundred and eighty counties (excluding Hainan Island, Taiwan, and Xinjiang), with a total strength of approximately one million people. In Guangdong, the people's armed forces have grown from 20,000 to over 70,000 in the past year, and the area of activity has expanded from over 30 counties to over 60 counties (out of a total of 98 counties in the province). In Yunnan, the people's armed forces had grown to over 44,000 by the end of last year, more than double the number from a year earlier (less than 20,000 at the end of 1946), occupying the vast countryside of 35 counties. In Guangxi, the people's armed forces had expanded to 39 counties by the end of last year. In Hunan and Hubei, the people's armed forces numbered 25,000, active in over 40 counties. In Xikang, the people's armed forces numbered nearly 200,000. In Sichuan, people's armies are active in almost all of the province's 140-plus counties and cities, comprising over a hundred units, large and small, with a total strength of 200,000. Even in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the two provinces under the longest control of the Chiang bandits, the vast rural areas of northern Jiangsu are entirely controlled by the People's Liberation Army. In the southern 28 counties, people's armed forces are known to be active in 23 counties. In Zhejiang, people's armies are active in 53 out of the province's 71 counties. In other provinces such as Fujian, Guizhou, Anhui, and Jiangxi, the people's armed forces are also continuing to develop.

    Looking at the trend of the development of the people's armed forces in the Chiang-controlled areas over the past year, the following characteristics are evident:

    (1) In order to consolidate their own strength and crush the Chiang bandits' "encirclement," "suppression," and "joint suppression" campaigns, the people's armed forces are gradually moving from dispersed activities to unified leadership, from moving around to establishing base areas, from isolated resistance to coordinated operations, and seizing enemy weapons to equip themselves, expanding into a powerful force. In southeastern Guangxi, the people's army led by Huang Shixian, which launched an uprising in March of last year, attacked Rongxian and captured Tengxian, has established the "Democratic Allied Army Independent 10th Division," and joined forces with the Liu Zhenxia Column of the Southern Guangdong People's Army, using the Gou Lou Mountain area as a base, with great momentum. The people's armed forces in the counties of Quanxian, Xing'an, and Gongcheng, adjacent to Hunan Province, have established the "Eastern Guangxi Liberated Area," using the Du Pang, Meng Zhu, and Lin He mountain ranges as bases, and have organized mass organizations such as trade unions, peasant associations, and women's associations. The people's army on the (Vietnam)-Guangdong border, using the Shiwan Dashan Mountains as a base, formed two columns and three divisions, with a strength of over 30,000, and once captured Dongxing, opening granaries to relieve the poor. The "Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan Border Region Command," based in the Dayu Mountains in northern Guangdong, leads a "People's Liberation Army North Route Column" of one division, extensively carrying out activities to harass the Chiang bandits. The cities of Nanxiong and Shixing have been isolated from the outside world and become isolated islands. The people's army in northern Sichuan, originating in Wangcang, once defeated four-pronged attacks by two regular Chiang bandit brigades and local militias, annihilated an entire detective battalion, expanded to tens of thousands of people, possessed machine guns, heavy artillery, and mortars, and operated in a vast area of more than ten counties. The people's army on the Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou border, comprising over ten units, large and small, was jointly organized into the "Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou General Command" by seventeen people's army leaders, growing from over three thousand to over ten thousand people. A unit of the people's army on the Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei border, using the Bamian Mountain as a base, crushed multiple attacks by the Chiang bandits. The unit has now established a political department and formulated operational guidelines such as dispersing and regrouping. The people's armed forces led by Xu Shihao in southern Yunnan have grown from a small team of several hundred people in 1946 to five or six thousand people, forming the Democratic Allied Army First Column, leading peasants to oppose the Chiang bandits' conscription and grain requisition tyranny. After repeatedly defeating the Chiang army and achieving continuous victories, the troops under the command of Huang Guozhang, commander of the Central Fujian Military District, marched south and successfully joined forces with the Daiyun Column in Southern Fujian and the Wang-led people's army active in the Longxi and Anxi mountains, sometimes launching joint attacks and sometimes dispersing to carry out raids. The troops are strictly disciplined and deeply supported by the broad masses of the people.

    (2) From simple military struggles, they have moved to destroy the Chiang bandits' reactionary ruling organs, establish patriotic and democratic regimes at all levels, and implement various democratic and beneficial policies. For example, the people's armed forces in the Siming Mountain area of eastern Zhejiang established the Zhejiang East Administrative Office and democratic county governments, carried out various democratic measures, and led the masses in resisting conscription and grain requisition. A unit of over a thousand people's army in Nanxiong County, northern Guangdong, destroyed over 30 Chiang bandit township offices, established six people's district governments, and launched a mass movement to divide grain and land. A reader's letter published in the Hong Kong "Masses Weekly" on September 11th last year stated: "In the rural areas of counties bordering Guangdong and Jiangxi, many have gotten rid of the rule of the Chiang bandits' regime, are self-reliant, are implementing rent and interest reduction, are providing famine relief, and are living a stable and upward life." In southern Guangdong, all of Huaxian and Wuchuan, except for the county seat and six townships, and all of Lianjiang and Suixi, except for three townships, have established democratic regimes. The Guangdong-Guangxi people's army is preparing to organize a democratic district government, and the Xikang People's Self-Defense Army Headquarters had already proposed the organization of a "People's Government" last year.

    (3) The political slogans and goals of the people's armed struggle have gradually become clearer and more elevated. From resisting conscription and grain requisition and punishing corrupt officials, they have advanced to opening granaries to relieve the poor and seizing land from local tyrants, launching a widespread peasant liberation movement. They have established a flesh-and-blood relationship with the broad masses of the people, and some have even explicitly put forward slogans such as opposing American imperialism's aggression against China and overthrowing the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. For example, the "Democratic Alliance Revolutionary Army" led by Huang More in southeastern Guangxi called for the realization of democracy, independence, and peace, and the overthrow of the fascist traitors! It launched activities in nearby counties, seizing grain and property from bullies and landlords wherever it went, which was deeply supported by the people. On the night of October 23rd last year, the people's armed forces in Changzhou, southern Jiangsu, attacked Qianjiashe and other villages in the seventh district and executed four heinous landlords, which greatly pleased the people. The people's armed forces in southern Fujian once led peasants in Anxi County to launch a movement against paying the "Prime Minister's Rent," opposing the feudal exploitation of the Ji family for three hundred years. Under the influence of the people's army's victorious attacks, more than 20,000 peasants in Lijing Township, Lanxi, southern Anhui, automatically rose up to capture the bully landlord Huang Liding, and divided more than 300 dan of grain and a large number of clothes and farm tools.

    With the victorious influence of the People's Liberation Army's large-scale counter-offensive in the future and the widespread dissemination of the Outline Land Law of China, it can be asserted that the anti-feudal struggle of the broad masses of peasants in the Chiang-controlled areas will further develop and deepen. It is precisely because the armed uprisings firmly defend the interests of the masses and vigorously help the peasants to liberate themselves that they have won the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people. For example, when the people's armed forces in southern Fujian held a cadre meeting, the peasants automatically took on the task of guarding and monitoring bad elements. When the masses discovered that the cadres attending the meeting were only eating two meals of thin porridge a day, they sent sweet potatoes, pickles, and beans, one basket at a time. In order to strengthen their own armed forces, many young peasants donated the money they earned from selling draftees to the people's army to buy weapons, and then escaped with their weapons to join the people's army in the shortest possible time.

    (4) Encouraged by the victories of the People's Liberation Army in most parts of the country, and in order to effectively coordinate with the People's Liberation Army in combat, the people's armed forces in the Chiang-controlled areas have launched large-scale and proactive attacks, from attacking Chiang bandit district and township offices to capturing towns and destroying Chiang bandit land and water transportation lines. Towns such as Jixi, Jingxian, and Maolin in Anhui, Changhua and Quzhou (a key town on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway) in Zhejiang, Wuxuan, Guixian, Hengxian, Rongxian, Tengxian, Senlin, and Wangang in Guangxi, Ya'an, Tianquan, and Rongjing in Xikang, and Shenzhen (on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, where most of the American-aided Chiang bandit war weapons were transported), Xuwen, Dabu, Nanxiong, and Shixing in Guangdong have all been attacked, besieged, and captured by the people's army. The people's army in the suburbs of Shanghai even once attacked Panlong Town, forty miles west of Shanghai. The Guangzhou-Kowloon, Pinghan, Xiang-Gui, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Yunnan-Vietnam Railways, the internal war transportation lines of the Chiang bandits, and the Jing-Wu (Nanjing to Wuhu), Jing-Qi (Nanjing to Qimen, Anhui), Xi (Wuxi) Cheng (Jiangyin), and Qing (Pu) Hu (Shanghai) highways have also been constantly threatened and attacked by the people's army. In November of last year, the people's army in southern Jiangsu coordinated with the large-scale counter-offensive, continuously attacked the Xi-Cheng Highway, stormed into Xicangdian and other places, and launched widespread propaganda along the way, posting slogans such as "People's Liberation Army's Large-Scale Counter-Offensive," shocking the enemy. The people's army in southern Anhui also launched a large-scale attack on the Jing-Wu and Wu-Tun highways, approaching the suburbs of Wuhu City, destroying the Wu-Tun highway, and dismantling the telegraph lines and bridges between Jixi and Ningkou, cutting off communication between the two cities. On November 18th, the people's armed forces destroyed the American-aided Chiang supply line, the Dakangkou iron bridge between Yingde and Qujiang on the Yuehan Railway, and cut off the Northern River water transport north of Yingde, all of which provided strong support to the People's Liberation Army marching south for the counter-offensive.

    Faced with the widespread attacks by the people's armed forces, Chiang bandit officials of all sizes were only panicked and "seeking help" and "reporting emergencies," with no way to resist.

    (5) The people's armed uprisings in the Chiang-controlled areas, led by peasants and workers, and including a wide range of classes, is also a prominent feature. In addition to the broad masses of workers and peasants actively participating and becoming the backbone of the armed uprisings in order to resist the Chiang bandits' conscription, grain requisition, and other tyrannical policies, there are also intellectuals, civil servants, Chiang army officers and soldiers, and ethnic minorities in the border areas. For example, the people's armed forces in Guangdong and Guangxi have a large number of intellectuals participating. A unit of the Chen Gaohe division of the people's army active on both sides of the Lijiang River has a unit of "Old Military Officer Corps" members participating. Yi people in Xikang rose up in armed self-defense to resist the Chiang bandits' massacre policy. The Xinjiang people's anti-Chiang autonomy movement is still continuing. Under the power of the people's armed forces and political efforts to win them over, the Chiang bandit local security teams have continued to revolt and surrender. For example, in October of last year, Dai Wenheng and nine others from the Chiang bandit self-defense team in Lupuxiang, Dinghai, eastern Zhejiang, revolted and defected to the people's armed forces with over ten light machine guns, submachine guns, and other weapons. In August, the people's army in Wengyuan, northern Guangdong, launched a "summoning surrender movement" against the Chiang army, and in just one or two townships, more than a hundred Chiang "self-defense teams" and "joint defense teams" surrendered with their weapons. In the future, as the war situation develops, the Chiang bandit army will be annihilated in large numbers, and the Chiang bandit-controlled areas will gradually shrink. Its source of soldiers will inevitably become more scarce, and its financial resources will inevitably be more exhausted. In order to maintain its dying rule, the Chiang bandits will inevitably more frantically requisition grain, conscript soldiers, massacre, and suppress, which will inevitably arouse greater and more fierce resistance from the people. It can be foreseen that in the future, the armed anti-Chiang movement in the vast rural areas of the Chiang-controlled areas will develop, consolidate, and grow more universally and intensely, and will further combine with the patriotic and democratic movements of workers and students in the big cities. When the People's Liberation Army victoriously advances, crosses the Yangtze River southward, and captures cities and lands, it will become a powerful vanguard, guide, and internal response, directly coordinating with the war, and finally ending the reactionary rule of the "black-hearted boss" Chiang Kai-shek!

　　过去一年间
  　蒋区民变武装的发展
    人民力量大如山，造反的钉耙千千万；鲜鱼要烂肚里烂，黑心头子你滚蛋！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——江南民谣
    过去一年间，蒋后民变武装飞跃发展。据现有材料统计：民军活动地区遍及十六省、四百八十余县（海南岛、台湾、新疆尚未计入），人数约百万。广东人民武装，去年一年由二万人发展为七万余人，活动地区由三十余县扩展至六十余县（全省共九十八县）；云南人民武装，截至去年底发展到四万四千人以上，较之一年前骤增一倍多（四六年底不足二万人），占领了三十五县的广大农村；广西人民武装，去年底已扩展至三十九县；湘、鄂人民武装数达二万五千，活动四十余县；西康人民武装近二十万人；四川全省百四十余县市，几乎都有民军活动，大小百余部，人数达二十万；即以蒋匪统治最久的江、浙两省言，江苏北部广大农村全部为解放军所控制，南部二十八县中，已知二十三县有人民武装活动；浙江全省七十一县中，有民军活动者达五十三县；他如闽、黔、皖、赣诸省人民武装，也都在继续发展中。
    综观过去一年间蒋后人民武装发展之趋势，明显的具有以下特点：
    （一）人民武装为团聚自己力量，粉碎蒋匪之“进剿”“围剿”“会剿”，逐渐由分散活动到统一领导，由四处流动到建立根据地，由孤立坚持到协同作战，并夺取敌人武器装备自己，扩展成为一支强大的劲旅，不少地区已造成乡村包围城市之形势。桂东南民军黄世宪部，去年三月起义，曾袭击容县、攻占藤县，已成立“民主联军独立第十师”，更与广东南路民军刘镇夏纵队会合，以勾漏山区为根据地，声势浩大；毗连湘境之全县、兴安、恭城等县的人民武装，则已成立“桂东解放区”，以都庞岭、萌渚岭、临贺岭为根据地，并组织工会、农会、妇女会等群众团体；越（南）粤边境民军，以十万大山为根据地，组成两个纵队三个师，人数达三万余，曾一举攻占东兴，开仓济贫；粤北以大庾岭为根据地之“赣、粤、湘边区司令部”率有“人民解放军北路纵队”一个师，广泛展开困扰蒋匪工作，南雄、始兴两县城已和外界隔绝而成孤岛；四川北部以旺苍为发祥地之民军，曾击溃蒋匪两个正规旅及地方团队的四路进攻，全歼一个侦缉大队，人数扩达数万，拥有机枪、重炮及迫击炮，活动十余县的广大地区。川、滇、黔边境民军，大小十余部，由十七位民军领袖合组“川滇黔总司令部”，由三千余人发展至万余人；黔湘鄂边境民军一部，以八面山为根据地，粉碎蒋匪多次进攻，现该部已设政治部，并订出化整为零、化零为整等作战方针；滇南人民武装许世好部由四六年数百人之小队扩展至五六千人，组成民主联军第一纵队，领导农民反对蒋匪征兵征粮暴政；闽中军分区司令黄国璋所部，于屡创蒋军取得不断胜利后，长驱南下，与闽南戴云纵队及活动于龙溪、安溪山地之王部民军胜利会师，时而合力出击，时而分散袭击，部队纪律严明，深得广大人民拥护。
    （二）从单纯的军事斗争，进而摧毁蒋匪反动的统治机构，建立各级爱国民主政权，实施各种民主善政。如浙东四明山区人民武装建立了浙东行政公署及民主县政府，进行各种民主设施，领导群众抗丁抗粮；粤北南雄县境某部民军千余人，摧毁了三十余个蒋匪乡公所，建立了六个人民区政府，并发动群众进行分粮分田斗争；去年九月十一日出版之香港“群众周刊”载读者投书称：“粤、赣边境各县的农村，很多已摆脱蒋匪政权的统治，自力更生，实行减租减息，救济饥荒，过着安定向上的生活。”粤南化县、吴川除县城及六乡外，廉江、遂溪除三乡外，均已全部建立民主政权；粤桂民军则正筹组民主区政府，西康人民自卫军总部早在去年便提出组织“人民政府”。
    （三）人民武装斗争的政治口号和目标，逐步的鲜明和提高。由抗丁抗粮、严惩贪官污吏，进而开仓济贫、打土豪分田地，掀起广泛的农民翻身运动。与广大人民建立了血肉关系，有的甚至明确提出反对美帝国主义侵华，打倒卖国贼蒋介石等口号。如桂东南黄末若领导的“民主联盟革命军”，号召实现民主、独立、和平，打倒法西斯卖国贼！向附近各县展开活动，所到之处，打恶霸分粮财，深得人民拥护。苏南常州人民武装，于去年十月二十三日夜，袭击七区钱家舍等村，将罪大恶极的四个恶霸大地主处决，人心大快；闽南人民武装在安溪县曾领导农民掀起反对季光第三百年来封建剥削的抗缴“相国租”运动；皖南人民，在民军胜利出击的影响下，郎溪离井乡二万多农民自动起来捉拿恶霸地主黄立鼎，分了三百多石谷子和大批衣服、农具。
    随着今后解放军大反攻的胜利影响和中国土地法大纲的广泛传播，可以断言，蒋后广大农民的反封建斗争将会更进一步的发展和深入。也正由于民变武装的坚决保卫群众利益、大力帮助农民翻身，这就获得了广大人民的热烈拥护。如闽南人民武装某次召开干部会议，农民们自动起来担任警戒，监视坏分子，群众发现开会干部每日只用两顿稀粥糊口，便你一筐我一捆的送来地瓜、酱菜、豆角。为了壮大自己的武装，不少青年农民以自己出卖壮丁所得之款，献给民军购买武器，而自己又于最短期间携械逃回参加民军。
    （四）为人民解放军全国大部分的胜利所鼓舞，有力配合解放军作战，蒋后人民武装纷纷大规模主动出击，由袭击蒋匪区乡保公所，进而攻略城镇，破坏蒋匪水陆运输交通线。如安徽之绩溪、泾县、茂林，浙江之昌化、衢州（浙赣路重镇），广西之武宣、贵县、横县、容县、滕县、森林、万岗，西康之雅安、天全、荣经，广东之深圳（在广九路上，美帝帮助蒋匪之内战武器多由此运入）、徐闻、大埔、南雄、始兴等城镇，均曾被民军袭击、围困和攻占；沪郊民军并曾一度攻入沪西四十里之蟠龙镇。蒋匪内战运输线广九、平汉、湘桂、浙赣、滇越等铁路，京芜（南京至芜湖）、京祁（南京至安徽祁门）、锡（无锡）澄（江阴）、青（浦）沪等公路，也不断遭受民军之威胁与攻击。去年十一月苏南民军配合大反攻，连续袭击锡澄公路，攻入西仓滇等地，并沿路展开广泛宣传，张贴“人民解放军大反攻”等标语，震破敌胆；皖南民军亦大举破袭京芜、芜屯两公路，逼近芜湖市郊，破毁芜屯公路，并拆除绩溪至宁口间之电线、桥梁，使得、宁间电讯中断；十一月十八日，人民武装破坏了美国援蒋补给线，粤汉铁路英德、曲江间大抗口铁桥，并截断英德以北的北江水上军运；这都给南下反攻的人民解放军以有力支持。
    面对着人民武装的广泛出击，蒋匪大小官员们只是惊恐万状的“求援”、“告急”，毫无招架办法。
    （五）蒋后民变武装，以农民、工人为领导，同时包括了广泛的阶层，也是一个显著的特点。其中除了广大工农群众为反抗蒋匪征兵征粮等暴政踊跃参加、成为民变武装的基干外，尚有知识分子、公务员、蒋军官兵及边疆的少数民族。如粤桂人民武装，均有大批知识分子参加；活动于丽江两岸的民军陈高和部，有“旧军官总队”队员一部参加；西康夷民为反抗蒋匪屠杀政策，纷起武装自卫；新疆人民反蒋自治运动，仍在持续发展中。而在人民武装的威力震慑及政治争取下，蒋匪地方保安团队不断起义投诚；如去年十月间，浙东定海芦蒲乡蒋匪自卫队戴文衡等九人起义，携轻机枪、手提机枪等十余支，投奔人民武装；八月间，粤北翁源民军对蒋军展开“召降运动”，仅一二个乡镇，即有百余名蒋记“自卫队”、“联防队”携械投诚。今后，随着战局的发展，蒋匪军更要大量被歼，蒋匪统治区更要日渐缩小；其兵源势必更加缺乏，财源势必更加枯竭，蒋匪为维持其垂死统治，又势必更加疯狂的征粮、抓丁、屠杀、镇压，这就必然激起人民更大更猛的反抗。可以预见：今后蒋区广大乡村的武装反蒋运动，将更普遍更炽烈的发展、巩固、壮大，并与大城市中工人、学生的爱国民主运动进一步结合，当人民解放大军胜利进军，渡江南下、攻城夺地之时，它将成为有力的先锋、向导和内应，直接配合作战，把“黑心头子”蒋介石的反动统治最后地结束！
