　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Washington dispatch: According to the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics on the 28th of last month, U.S. workers staged 150 strikes in November alone, involving 45,000 people. From January to November of last year, there were a total of 3,325 strikes, involving 2.2 million people, with a loss of 34 million workdays. At the same time, due to high prices, real wages have fallen sharply, and even now, 4 million key industrial sectors and railway workers are demanding revisions to wage standards. According to the CIO's newspaper, "CIO News," the government, after passing anti-labor laws, is preparing more anti-labor measures, such as banning collective bargaining and abolishing the 40-hour work week. The newspaper urges the working class to step up their struggle for their economic and political rights.

　　美国工人一年来
  　二百万人罢工
    【新华社陕北四日电】华盛顿讯：据美劳工部劳工统计局上月二十八日公布：美国劳工在去年十一月份中，共罢工一百五十次，参加人数达四万五千名。去年由一月至十一月，则共罢工三三二五次，参加人数为二百二十万人，损失工作日三千四百万个。同时由于物价高涨引起了实际工资的严重跌落，甚至现在尚有四百万重要工业部门和铁道工人在要求修改工资标准。据产联机关报“产联新闻”称：政府在反劳工法案之后，正在准备更多的反劳工措施，如禁止集体谈判，废除每周四十小时工作制等。该报力促工人阶级为他们的经济政治权利加紧进行斗争。
