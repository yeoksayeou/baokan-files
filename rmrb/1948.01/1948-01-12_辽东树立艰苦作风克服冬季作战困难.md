Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th:

　　A certain company, the Fourth Company, of the Liaodong Liberation Army used the "comparison" method in its rectification training to discuss how to overcome the difficulties of winter operations. This achieved significant results in establishing a hardworking ideological style and stimulating class emotions. The content of the comparisons included: (1) Comparing with the enemy: Many comrades said, "The enemy is being beaten, we are proactive, and the enemy is suffering much more than us." Liberated soldier Liu Zhi'an said, "When I was in the Kuomintang army last year at this time, I didn't even have a cotton coat. This year, I've already put one on. Even if it's a little hard fighting for myself today, it's nothing." (2) Comparing with last year: Last year, our equipment and supplies were more difficult to obtain. This year, it's much better. (3) Comparing with before joining the army: Han Chunshan said, "During the puppet Manchukuo period, we had to do hard labor in the severe winter. The suffering was much greater. Now, in the people's army, it's much better than that. What's there to complain about?" Many comrades said, "Before, when working at home, we had to get up before the rooster crowed, and the suffering was entirely for the landlords. Today, enduring some hardship is for revenge, for all the poor brothers to turn over." (4) Comparing with meritorious personnel: Everyone said, "They are people, and so are we. If they can perform meritorious service, can't we even persevere?" (5) Comparing with old comrades from inside the Pass: Zhang Yitian said, "The old comrades inside the Pass have gone through eight years of the War of Resistance, eaten bran, and suffered hardships, but they are still just as energetic." (6) Comparing with the Red Army in the past: Fu Changzhi said, "The Red Army marched 25,000 li for the sake of resisting Japan, crossing snow-capped mountains and grasslands. How much suffering did they endure? Our little bit of suffering is nothing compared to that." (7) Comparing with older comrades: Everyone believes that the comrades in the kitchen, with such long beards, are still working actively. What are we young people afraid of? (8) Comparing with the civilian laborers: There is a North Manchurian stretcher brigade stationed nearby, all of whom came from Harbin. They are determined "not to return until they reach Shenyang." Can't we even match the determination of the civilian laborers? (9) Comparing with the poor people who have not yet turned over: Wu Guoliang said, "The poor people are wearing such tattered clothes. We have cotton clothes to wear. Can't we make it through?" (10) Comparing with the superiors: Many liberated soldiers said, "The officials on the Kuomintang side oppress and exploit the soldiers, eating well and dressing well. Our superiors here are just as hardworking as we are, and they are good examples for us." From these comparisons, everyone believes that all the difficulties of winter operations can be overcome. Everyone has a furnace in their heart, and that furnace is class consciousness. It can melt steel, just as Comrade Lin Xuecheng said, "As long as the flame in our minds does not go out, we can overcome all difficulties."

　　辽东树立艰苦作风克服冬季作战困难
    【新华社东北九日电】辽东解放军某部四连在整训中用“对比”方法，讨论如何克服冬季作战困难，对树立艰苦思想作风，激发阶级情感，获得显著成果。对比的内容有：（一）同敌人比：很多同志说：“敌人挨打，我们主动，敌人比我们苦得多。”解放战士刘知安说：“我在国民党队伍里去年这个时候还没有穿上棉衣，今年却早已穿上了，今天为自己打仗即使有些苦，也算不了什么。”（二）同去年比：去年我们装备补充比较困难，今年却好得多。（三）同入伍前比：韩春山说：“伪满时做苦工，严冬都得干，苦头大得多，现在在人民队伍里比那时强了不知道多少倍，还有什么苦。”有很多同志都说：“以前在家干活，鸡不叫就爬起来，而且受罪完全是为的地主，今天吃些苦是为了报仇，为了穷哥儿们大伙翻身。”（四）比功臣：大家都说：“人家是人，咱也是人，人家能立功，难道咱连坚持还不行吗？”（五）比关内老同志：张义田说：“关内老同志经过八年抗战，吃过糠受过苦，现在还是一样有劲。”（六）比过去红军：傅长治说：“红军为了抗日，行军两万五千里，过雪山草地吃了多少苦，咱这点苦哪里比得上。”（七）比年老的同志：大家认为，伙房的同志胡子那么长了还积极的干，咱们年纪轻怕啥。（八）比民工：附近驻有北满担架大队，都是从哈尔滨出来的，他们都决心“不到沈阳不回去”，难道咱还比不上民工的决心。（九）比还未翻身的穷人：吴国良说：“穷人穿的那样破，咱们有棉衣穿，还过不去吗”？（十）和上级比：很多解放战士说：“国民党那边当官的压迫当兵的，剥削当兵的，吃得好、穿得好，咱们这儿上级跟咱们一样艰苦，是咱们的好榜样。”从这些对比中，大家认为冬天作战的一切困难都可以克服。每个人都有一个火炉，这火炉就是阶级觉悟。它能熔化钢铁，正如林学成同志所说：“只要思想上的火焰不熄灭，就能克服一切困难。”
