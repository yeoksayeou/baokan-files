　　Xijing Rich Peasant Cadre Abducts Hired Laborer's Wife
　　Wu'an Government Shields Thug
 　  Lawsuit Reaches Border Region Government, Unresolved After Two Years
　　[Report from this newspaper] Guo Wenzhang, a hired poor disaster victim from Xijing Village, Wu'an, had his wife seized by the agricultural association director, who was from a rich peasant family. His lawsuit, filed from the district to the special commissioner's office, has been stonewalled for two years, with governments at all levels failing to resolve it from a class standpoint. This time, he came to the Border Region Government to file a complaint and personally requested this newspaper to publish his statement on his behalf. The situation is as follows:
　　Guo Wenzhang is a hired poor disaster victim from Xijing Village, Wu'an. For nine years, he and his father and son suffered for the rich peasant Wang Wenyi (whether Wang Wenyi is from a rich peasant or landlord background deserves re-examination), renting mountain land and even repairing one mu of land for him. Every year, they paid a rent of one dan and eight dou. After the age of twenty, he went to Shanxi to farm mountain land, but his family couldn't adapt to the environment, and his wife and brothers and sisters-in-law all died of illness. In the 30th year of the Republic [1941], he fled famine to Shangyao, Licheng, to open a restaurant. His father stayed in his hometown and starved to death after selling the house and land (two mu). In the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he sought out a refugee woman, Wang Cunlan, as his partner, and his cousin introduced them, sending her to Black Tiger Temple in Licheng to get married. Soon after, they went together to Anze to farm mountain land. In May of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], Guo Wenzhang sent his wife back to Wu'an from Anze, carrying 30,000 yuan to settle in Xijing. When the woman returned, the agricultural association director, Wang Wenyi, saw her and considered her a good "match," detaining her at the home of the landlord Wang Shijie. Guo Wenzhang's uncle was so anxious that he searched everywhere. Guo said: "When my woman showed her face, the agricultural association director had already agreed on the marriage with District Chief Guo Chaodong and married Wang Wenyi."
　　He continued to explain the origin of the matter: "On the 22nd day of the fifth lunar month, I returned from fleeing famine in Anze and met Hu Shuiheng, a farmer from my village, at Dongguan, Licheng, who said that my wife had been seized by a cadre and married off. I went home and found the village chief, asking who authorized the allocation of my wife to the agricultural association director. The village chief said, 'District Chief Guo made the decision, and our village cadres can't control it.' At that time, I went to the Sixth District Office of Huoshui to file a complaint with District Chief Zhao. The government called the woman to the district office and detained her for six days. Without paying attention to us, they sent her back. I heard people say that the village cadres went to the Seventh District to seek connections, and District Chief Guo of the Seventh District encouraged the agricultural association director, saying, 'I guarantee that this woman won't be lost; if she is lost, I'll compensate you with three.' District Chief Guo sent a letter and released the woman. I went to District Chief Zhao again, and he said, 'This was handled by District Chief Guo, and I can't control it.' He told me to go to the Seventh District Office to resolve it. I knew that District Chief Guo was of one mind with the village cadres and didn't want to go to the Seventh District. District Chief Zhao also said, 'I can't control it; it's up to you whether you go!' I had no choice but to accuse District Chief Zhao, saying, 'If you are willing to handle it, handle it for us; if you are not willing, please approve it for the county to handle!' I went to the county government. The first time, I found a female comrade who told me to go back to the district to resolve it. The second time, I found the Civil Affairs Section; two section chiefs. One asked, 'Who is being unreasonable in handling this matter?' The other said, 'It is not right for Guo Chaodong, this boor (?), to handle this matter!' I said, 'Isn't it inappropriate to handle it like this? They just handled it like this, or else I wouldn't be filing a lawsuit!' The female comrade said something conscientious: 'The village cadres are handling it unreasonably; they should call the woman to resolve it face-to-face.' Later, the Judicial Section asked twice, and the section chief's mind changed, saying, 'The district office cannot quarrel with the district office, and the village cannot have conflicts with the village.' They "officials protect each other" and shelved our marriage. The fifth time the lawsuit was inquired about, the Judicial Section Chief questioned me: 'Do you have a marriage certificate?' I explained the origin of our marriage, how I had filed a lawsuit with the original husband, Zhang Xinchun, in Anze County for this wife, and the marriage certificate was lost in the enemy's mopping-up operations, but the Anze County government had stamped it with a "square seal" (referring to the county seal) as proof. The section chief was impatient to listen to my words and questioned: 'Who gave you the certificate? You have to take responsibility for casually stamping the square seal!' He said that I 'spent a few years with her in a muddle, and the money you brought doesn't matter!' I said, 'Now, in a democratic government, even stamping the village office's long seal requires responsibility; how can the county government's square seal be stamped casually?' The Judicial Section Chief got angry, slammed the table, and told me to 'get out!' 'Get out!' What could I do? I had to walk out the door. I stood outside the door of the democratic government for a while, unable to understand, and went back in to tell the section chief: 'If you say the certificate issued by Anze County is fake, please write a letter to Anze County government to investigate; I am not afraid of running back and forth.' They ignored me."
　　"For this matter, I have run back and forth two or three times from Taiyue. The year before last, in October, I obtained the certificate from Anze, returned to the Wu'an County government. At that time, they were busy preparing for war and couldn't take care of resolving my marriage problem, so I wasted a lot of travel expenses and went back. Last March, I brought the certificate from Anze County government and went to the Wu'an County government to demand justice. The civil affairs officials still 'officials protect each other,' shielding the rich peasant thug Wang Wenyi, saying: 'Guo Wenzhang, don't make trouble about this matter anymore. The district has already agreed, and the woman doesn't want to be with you anymore. Mediate a bit and go back!' I thought: The 'democratic government' is not a 'group government,' and it should speak a little bit of justice, and I should at least ask for a reasonable judgment. Who knew that the Civil Affairs Section said, 'Our matter doesn't deserve a judgment.' I heard the people say: 'District Chief Guo is supporting him, how can this lawsuit be won?' Others told me it's best to find the 'real county magistrate' to complain and seek justice. That day, I saw the county magistrate reading the newspaper, so I went to him to tell my grievances, I asked the government to give me a judgment, but the county magistrate didn't resolve it and still told me to go to the section chief to resolve it. I waited in the Judicial Section for two days. The county government issued two official documents to the district office, but they couldn't transfer anyone. I waited in Wu'an until my travel expenses were exhausted, so I had to return to Anze with the official document from Anze County."
　　"Last year, I returned to my old home in Wu'an, and the only two mu of land at home were also sold, and not a single fruit was distributed to me in the village. I heard from the villagers that the worker Zhang Yurong (phonetic) and District Chief Guo Chaodong were both supporting him in the lawsuit, and I felt that there was no place to speak, so I found the Border Region Government and asked to express my hatred. At that time, the cadres of the Border Region Government were holding a land conference and transferred it to the Taihang Administrative Office, and the official business called on the Wu'an County government to resolve it quickly. The comrades of the Wu'an Judicial Section said that I was restless, thinking that the woman was unwilling to be with me, and offered me 5,000 yuan, later increased to 7,000 yuan, to casually resolve it. I thought that after fighting a lawsuit for two years, I couldn't get the old woman back, and the 30,000 yuan I brought home and the jewelry on the woman's hands were not returned to me, so what democracy is there in this world!? I also sued the Fifth Special Commissioner's Office. The director of the Judicial Office of the Special Commissioner's Office spoke a few fair words for the poor, scolding the director of the agricultural association for using the power of a cadre to threaten and force a woman who fled famine to marry him, which was completely the criminal behavior of a local tyrant and thug. But the director of the Judicial Office came forward to 'mediate,' asking to compensate 80,000 yuan, 'telling me and Wang Cunlan to divorce, and the agricultural association director and my wife to officially form a husband and wife relationship from that day on.' I disagreed in my heart and raised opinions to the government: District Chief Guo Chaodong shielded the cadre, and the Wu'an County government handled it one-sidedly, judging my wife to the thug. I have gone to all the large and small organs, and the result is still that people and money are lost, I am afraid that the people will still not dare to raise their heads, and some bad women will not love the poor, and only look for cadres with power and influence. Such a practice will open a bad road for the new society. The director of the Judicial Office thought that what I said was very reasonable. But he didn't act according to the poor's reasoning! He still told my wife to live with the agricultural association cadre."
　　Guo Wenzhang, a hired poor who had suffered more than 30 years of pain in the old society, ran around everywhere to fight for his human rights and democratic rights, and walked through the doors of democratic governments, and said all the big and small reasons, but still couldn't find a place to speak justice and reason. He requested the people's newspaper to tell the farmer's just demands.

　　西井富农干部霸占雇贫老婆
  　武安政府包庇恶霸
    官司打到边府两年还没解决
    【本报消息】武安西井村雇贫郭文章被富农出身的农会主任霸占了妻子，打官司从区打到专署，打了两年都碰了钉子，各级政府都没有站在阶级立场上解决。这次他来边府告状，并亲至本报要求代笔将他的意见登在报上。事情是这样：
    郭文章是武安西井村一个雇贫灾民，父子三人给富农王文义家（王文义是富农还是地主出身，还值得重新审查）受苦，租种过九年山地，还替他修过一亩地。每年出一石八斗租子。二十岁后又到山西种山地，家里人不服水土，老婆和兄弟哥嫂都病死了。三十年逃荒到黎城上窑开饭铺，父亲留在老家，把房、地（二亩）卖光也饿死啦。三十二年寻了一个难民妇女王存蓝作对象，由本家哥替他介绍，送到黎城黑虎庙结婚。不久，他们便一同到安泽种山地了。三十五年五月郭文章从安泽县打发老婆回武安，带着三万块钱回西井安家，娘们回去被农会主任王文义瞧见，当作一个好“对象”，扣在地主王世杰家里。急得郭文章的本家叔叔到处寻找。郭说：“当我那娘们露出头来，农会主任已和区长郭朝栋说好婚事，同王文义结婚啦”。
    他又接着说这件事的来历：旧历五月二十二那天，我从安泽逃荒回来，走到黎城东关碰上俺村农民胡水恒说，俺老婆被干部卡住结婚了。我回家找到村长，问谁作主把俺老婆配给农会主任啦？村长说：“是郭区长作主，俺们村干部都管不了。”当时我就到活水六区公所找赵区长告状，政府把娘们叫到区署押了六天，没理咱就送回去了。俺听人说：村干部上七区投门子，七区郭区长给人家农会主任打气：“保证没不了这个娘们，弄没啦包赔你三个。”郭区长捎一封信就把娘们放回去了。俺又找到赵区长，他说：“这是郭区长手下办的，我管不了。”叫我去找七区公所解决。俺明知郭区长是和村干部一心的，不愿上七区。赵区长还说：“咱管不了，不去随你的便吧！”我没办法，告赵区长说：“你愿管给咱管管，不愿管给咱批到县上去管吧！”我到县政府，头回找到一位女同志，叫咱还回区解决。第二回找到民政科，两个科长，一个问：“谁不讲理办这事呢？”一个说：“是郭朝栋这个老粗（？）办这事可不应该呢？”我说：“可不是不该这样办，他们就这样办了，要不我就来打官司呢？”还是那位女同志说了句良心话：“村干部办的不合理，应该叫娘们来当面解决。”后来司法科问了两趟，科长的心眼变了卦，说：“区公所不能与区公所闹蹩扭，村上不能和村上起矛盾。”人家“官官相卫”，就把咱这婚姻大事抱下啦。官司问到第五趟，司法科长就盘问我：“有没有结婚证？”我声明了俺们结婚的来由，为寻这个老婆曾经与原丈夫张新春在安泽县政府打过官司，结婚证被敌人扫荡无啦，可是安泽县政府盖有“方章”（即指县印）作证明。科长不耐烦听咱的话，追问：“谁给你开的证明，随便按方章，可得负责任呢？”说我“糊里糊涂给人家过了几年，带的那钱可以不必要啦！”我就说：“如今民主政府，按村公所的长章还得负责任，县政府的方章，哪能随便按上呢？”司法科长生气啦，拍开桌子，叫我“出去”！“出去”！咱有啥法，只得走出大门。在民主政府门外站了一会，想不通又进去告诉科长说：“你们说安泽县开的证明是假的，请你开封信到安泽县府去调查，我是不怕来回跑路的。”他们也没理会。
    为着这件事，俺从太岳又来回奔跑了两三趟。前年十月从安泽办好证明，回到武安县政府，当时正忙着备战，顾不上解决俺的婚姻问题，白花许多路费回去了。去年三月俺又带着安泽县政府的证明，找到武安县府要求声冤，民政科的官老爷们，还是“官官相卫”，包庇富农恶霸王文义，说：“郭文章这事不用再闹了，区上已经说好，娘们也不愿跟你过啦，调解一下还是回去吧！”我想：“民主政府”不是“团体政府”，总得说二分公理，好歹要求一个合理的判决才行，哪知民政科说“咱这事够不上一个判决书。”我听老百姓说：“人家郭区长在顶着门子，这官司怎能打出头呢？”别人告我最好去找着“真（正）县长”才能诉苦声冤。那天我瞧见县长在看报，就去找他诉说咱的冤屈，俺求政府给咱一个判决书，县长没给解决，还是叫我去找科长解决，我又到司法科等了两天。县政府给区公所下了两道公事都调不上人来，我在武安等的把路费都花光了，只好带着安泽县政府的公事返回安泽去了。
    我去年重回武安老家，家里仅有的二亩土地也卖啦，村中也没分给一点果实。听乡亲们说：工作员张玉戎（音同）和区长郭朝栋都顶着门子给他打官司，感到没有地方好说话，就找到边区政府，要求说理解恨。那时边区政府干部正开土地会议，转到太行行署，去公事叫武安县政府赶快解决。武安司法科同志说我不安分，认为娘们不愿跟我过，包给咱五千块钱，后增到七千元，马虎解决。我想打了二年官司，老波找不回来，连带回家的三万块钱和娘们手上带的首饰也不归还于我，这世道还讲什么民主！？我又告到五专署。专署司法处长给穷人说了几句公道话，训斥农会主任，凭着干部势力，威胁强迫逃荒回家娘们结婚，完全是土豪恶霸犯罪行为。但司法处长又出面“调解”，让包赔八万块钱，“叫我和王存蓝离婚，农会主任和咱老婆从当天起正式成立夫妻关系”。我心里不同意，向政府提出意见：郭朝栋区长包庇干部，武安县政府片面处理，把俺老婆判给恶霸。俺大小机关都走到了，落的结果还是人财两空，恐怕老百姓还是不敢抬头，有些坏妇女还会不爱穷人，专找有权有势的干部，这样干法会对新社会开了一条坏道路。司法处长认为我说的理路很对。可是他没按穷人的道理办事！还是叫咱老婆与农会干部过。
    在旧社会曾经受过三十多年痛苦生活的雇贫郭文章，为着争取自己的人权和民主权利到处奔跑，走遍了民主政府的大门，大小道理都说遍了，还是找不到一个声冤说理的地方。他要求人民的报纸，诉说一下农民的正义要求。
