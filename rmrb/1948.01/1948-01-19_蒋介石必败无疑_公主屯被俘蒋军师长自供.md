Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 17th. Commanders of a certain unit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army summoned Liu Guangtian (formerly misidentified as Miao Guangtian), commander of the enemy's 43rd Division, and Yi Xiyin, the division's chief of staff, and others who laid down their arms in the great victory at Gongzhutun, at their residence on the 9th. Liu Guangtian described the embarrassing situation when he was captured, saying: On the morning of the 7th, when the People's Liberation Army fiercely bombarded Wenjiatai, their command post was immediately thrown into chaos, and contact with the military headquarters (the enemy's New Fifth Army), which was in the same village, was immediately cut off. The military headquarters did not want the division, and the division did not look for the military headquarters; each was panic-stricken and only cared about escaping. When the People's Liberation Army attacked the village, he once thought of using valuables to bribe the People's Liberation Army soldiers to let him go, but the soldiers sternly refused, but they did not insult him in the slightest. He and Yi Xiyin were very grateful for the leniency of the People's Liberation Army. Speaking of the future of the civil war, both Liu and Yi said that they had long lost confidence. They also said: The Chinese people are against Chiang Kai-shek's selling out the country and engaging in civil war. We have also witnessed the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas suffering from hunger and cold, and anti-Chiang struggles are springing up everywhere. This alone shows that Chiang Kai-shek is destined to fail.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 17th. Xie Daizheng, the major general division commander of the Chiang bandits' so-called "important mobile force," the 195th Division, quickly admitted his name and position after being captured. At first, he was commanding operations in Dongbian Jiuhuang. After a fierce attack by the People's Liberation Army, two battalions of a bandit army regiment were defeated. Seeing that the situation was not good, he hurriedly fled to Jiutun. However, the next day, the People's Liberation Army advanced again, and he, without bandaging his wounded left arm, hurriedly handed over the division's direct units to the deputy division commander, and he fled to Wenjiatai again. Before he had time to rest, the People's Liberation Army surrounded the village again the next morning, and the artillery fire was as dense as a string of pearls, making it impossible for him to move an inch. He had no choice but to squat in a bunker to hide, and finally became a prisoner. He had long been familiar with the lenient policy of the People's Liberation Army. He cited the examples of Li Zhengyi, the former commander of the Kuomintang's 25th Division, and Duan Peide, the commander of the 20th Division, saying, "I am a colleague of theirs, and I know a lot about their situation after being captured." When reporters asked him why he was still blindly bragging seven days before being captured, saying, "This offensive by the Communist bandits is no different than a moth flying into a flame"? He hurriedly shirked responsibility, saying that the "Appeal to Officers and Soldiers" was written by a major staff officer. Xie Daizheng is from Xiangxiang, Hunan, is 40 years old this year, and graduated from the sixth class of Huangpu Military Academy. His parents, wife, and four children still live in Shenyang.

　　“蒋介石必败无疑”
  　公主屯被俘蒋军师长自供
    【新华社东北前线十七日电】东北解放军某部指挥员九日在驻地召见公主屯大捷中放下武器的敌四十三师师长留光天（前误为苗光天）及该师参谋长易希殷等。留光天叙述被俘时的狼狈情形说：七日清早当解放军向文家台猛烈炮轰时，他们的指挥部顿时陷入混乱，和同在一个村里的军部（敌新五军）联系，立告断绝。军部不要师部、师部也不去找军部，各自惊慌失措，只顾逃命。解放军攻进了村子，他当时曾想用贵重东西收买解放军战士放走他，但战士们都严厉拒绝，可是对他却丝毫未加侮辱，他和易希殷都非常感谢解放军的宽大。提起内战前途，留、易两人都表示，他们早已失掉信心。并说：中国老百姓都反对蒋介石卖国内战，我们也目睹蒋区人民饥寒交迫，到处掀起反蒋斗争，只此一点，就可看出蒋介石必败无疑。
    【新华社东北前线十七日电】蒋匪的所谓“重要机动部队”一九五师少将师长谢代蒸被俘后，很快的承认了自己的姓名和职务。起先他是在东边旧隍指挥作战，经解放军猛烈冲杀，匪军一个团被打垮了两个营，他看见情况不好，便慌忙逃到九家屯。可是第二天解放军又向前逼进，他顾不及包扎负伤的左臂，急忙把师直属队交给副师长，自己又逃到文家台，还没有得到休息，第三天早晨解放军又把这个村子包围，炮火密如连珠，他寸步难行，只好蹲在一个地堡里躲避，最后作了俘虏。他对解放军的宽大政策是很早就熟悉的，他举出前蒋军二十五师师长李正谊和二十师师长段培德的例子说：“我和他们是同事，他们被俘后的情形我知道得很多。”当记者追问他为什么在被俘前七天还瞎吹什么：“共匪此次攻势实无异于飞蛾扑火”？他连忙推卸那篇“告官兵书”是一个少校参谋写的。谢代蒸是湖南湘乡人，今年四十岁，黄埔六期毕业。他的父母妻子和四个孩子现在都还住在沈阳。
