　　Cadres in Tian Village Distribute Remaining Fruits
  　Unable to Meet Poor Peasant Demands
    [Shahe News] In the sixth district of Tian Village, more than sixty poor peasant households, of which more than forty are currently suffering from insufficient food and drink. According to the review of land reform conducted by the village's poor peasants on the thirtieth night of last year (November 19th of the lunar calendar), everyone calculated who had surplus grain. The grain harvested by these forty-odd poor peasants and hired laborers is only enough to eat for the year; two households have almost nothing to eat right now! The poor peasant Kong Zhen said, "My family of two only has four dou of buckwheat left!" Some of the hired peasants in this village had attended meetings in the district, and upon returning to the village, they grumbled to everyone, "Why haven't we completely turned ourselves around? When we encounter a bad year, we have nothing to eat." Everyone said, "How can we thoroughly turn ourselves around if we don't hold power?" Feng Fang said, "We are present during the struggle, but when it comes to distributing the fruits, we don't get a share. What's the point? Twenty out of twenty-two reviewers are middle peasants. Whose line are they following?" Kong @Fang said, "My land is all sandy. When the land was distributed, I said to the reviewer, 'There is good land in the west of the village; can you give me some?' The reviewer said, 'You already have a lot of land; we'll give you more later!' They gave the good land in the west of the village to five middle peasant households. Later, they didn't even give me any poor land. They said that this land was connected to the land boundary of those households, and it was more appropriate to give it to the middle peasant households. Our land is poor, and the harvest is bad; how can we have enough to eat?" Then everyone thought about how to fill the gaps. Shuanzhu said, "I want to do business, but I don't have any capital. I want to engage in transportation, but my little donkey can't pull for long." Everyone wants to do something, but they lack capital. Later, someone asked where our capital would come from. Where did the fruits stored by the farmers' association go? Seeing the difficulties of the poor peasants and hired laborers, the village cadres had to fill the gap. They immediately registered the things used to reorganize village finances and calculated 800,000 yuan to temporarily solve the current production capital difficulties of the poor peasants and hired laborers.

    Editor's Note: In Tian Village, sixty poor peasant and hired labor households, currently forty of which are lacking food and drink, urgently demand a thorough transformation. The cadres want to use the remaining fruits of the struggle and village public funds to block the demands of the poor peasants and hired laborers. This method does not conform to the spirit of the published Land Law Outline. The local leadership should immediately investigate and correct it.

　　田村干部分配剩余果实
  　不能满足贫雇要求
    【沙河消息】六区田村有六十多户贫农，眼下就有四十多户贫雇少吃缺喝，根据本村贫农去年卅晚上（旧历十一月十九日）的翻身检查，大家盘算谁家还有余粮？这四十多户贫雇，打的粮食只够年头吃；还有两户眼下就没啥吃喝！贫农孔振的说：“俺家两口人，眼前只有四斗荞麦啦”！这村雇贫有的曾经到区开过会，回到村里就和大家圪嚷，咱们为啥没啦彻底翻过身？碰上个坏年景就没啥吃。大家说：咱没掌权怎能彻底翻身？冯防说：闹斗争时有咱，到分配果实的时候，就没咱的份，评啥；二十二个评议员，就有廿个中农，人家是谁的路线呢？孔＠方说：我家都是沙地，分配土地时，我给评议员说：“村西有好地，该给我点吧？”评议员说：“你的地不少了，以后再给你吧！”人家把村西好地都给了五户中农，以后连赖地也没有给我。还说这地和人家地界连在一块。给人家中农户合适。咱们地赖年景又不好，打的粮食怎会够吃哩！接着大家想法，怎么补住空子？拴柱说：“我想做买卖，就是没有本钱，想去搞运输，小驴又不能长拉，大家都想干，就是本钱少。以后有人提出咱的本钱靠哪里解决？农会存下的果实到哪里去了？村干部看到大家的窟窿非填不可，便想把剩的果实分给贫雇，第二天干部马上把整理村财政的东西登记起来，算出八十万元，暂时解决贫雇眼前生产资本的困难。  　　　　　（牛黑的）  　　　　　　　　　
    按：田村六十户贫雇，眼前即有四十户缺吃喝，迫切要求彻底翻身，干部想以剩余的斗争果实及村财政公款来堵死贫雇要求，这种办法是不符合于已公布的土地法大纲的精神，当地领导上应立即检查纠正。
