Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th: Farmers in the Chiang Kai-shek-occupied areas of Shaanxi are in an extremely miserable situation under the cruel exploitation of the Chiang-Hu bandit gang. The Shaanxi provincial Chiang bandits' collection of land tax and public grain is calculated based on the "land grain silver" announced on July 1st, with each yuan equivalent to 19 catties and 14 taels of grain, which increased to 39 catties and 12 taels per yuan in October. Now it has increased from 1.84 dou per yuan (30 catties per dou) to 3.44 dou. Jingyang County has already levied additional grain taxes twice, and the third time is about to begin. The Chiang-Hu bandit gang's exorbitant taxes and levies are even more numerous, such as "village chief's meeting fee in the county," "self-defense army's inspection fee in the county," "telephone pole fee," "road repair fee," "township head's guest reception fee," "committee member's visit reception fee," "township representative's reception fee," "garrison troop's coal transportation fee," and so on. In Changsun Township, Sanyuan County, the payment slips posted on the walls of each household in Qujia Slope and Quzi villages were enough to reach three zhang in length in just eight months last year, and each slip was written with three or four types of apportionments. In addition, there were extortions such as a fine of 60,000 yuan for unclear household registration, a fine of 5,000 yuan for walking without a road permit (the fine before February last year, which has now increased), and a punishment of up to six months of "imprisonment" for failing to report guests, or cash substitutes, etc. Local tyrants, secret agents, and village heads all shift all burdens onto the poor. Liu Lutang (a secretary with a simplified appointment in Chiang Kai-shek's Supervisory Yuan), a landlord in Changfang Village, Erbao Township, Xianqian Township, Sanyuan County, owns more than 600 mu of land, but his burden is the same as a poor farmer in the village who cultivates six mu of land. In addition, they exploit the people through usury and commercial speculation. Zhao Fen, a large landlord in Xianyang County (his brother Zhao Ting is a pro-Chiang Kai-shek Shaanxi provincial appointed senator), owns more than 10 qing of land and lends more than 3,000 shi of grain at high interest. Yang Jiahui, a speculative merchant and pseudo-senator in Gaoling County, lends 6,000 shi of grain. When the Chiang Kai-shek government urgently presses for grain and payments, the bureaucratic landlords and merchants manipulate the market, and the price of cotton suddenly plummets after the autumn harvest, while the price of wheat rises sharply. Under such brutal plunder by the Chiang-Hu bandit gang, many farmers are ruined and die. In the vast rural areas of Jingyang, Sanyuan, Yaoxian, and Chang'an counties, in order to resist this bone-sucking extortion by the Chiang-Hu bandit gang, children are now taking turns to watch in front of and behind the villages. When they see a team carrying guns to demand payment, they shout "They're coming!", and all the people in the village flee to the wilderness. However, the Chiang-Hu bandit gang's "payment collection team" takes the opportunity to ransack everywhere and rob at will.

Another report: The various large and small people's armed forces in southern Shaanxi number about 5,000 to 6,000 people. The most important of these is a part of the "Shangluo Guerrilla Headquarters," with more than 4,700 people and guns, led by Gong Defang and Wang Lie as commander and deputy commander respectively. In 1946, they operated in the mountains south of the Longhai Railway, in Shanyang, Shangxian, Luonan, Zhen'an (the above four counties have been liberated by our Chen-Xie army), Zhashui, Baocheng, Huangxian, Lueyang, and Lantian counties. They once attacked Zhen'an County and established a democratic government in Shangxian County. In addition, there are more than ten units including Wang Ziwei, Wang Ziping, and Wang Zhenjie, with more than 1,000 people, who are conducting guerrilla warfare in the counties along the Longhai Railway, including Huayin, Weinan, Huaxian, Xingping, Liquan, Wugong, Qianxian, Qishan, ＠xian, Fufeng, Linyou, Fengxiang, Baoji, and Anyang counties.

　　陕西胡匪残酷敲榨
  　蒋区农民家破人亡
    陕南人民武装发展到六千人
    【新华社西北十三日电】陕西蒋占区农民在蒋胡匪帮残酷压榨下，已陷极悲惨境地。陕省蒋匪征收田赋公粮系以其七月一日公布的“地粮银”计算，每元合粮十九斤十四两，十月份即增到每元折三十九斤十二两。现已由每元合一斗八升四合（每斗三十斤）增加到三斗四升四合。泾阳县则已加征赋粮两次，而第三次又将开始。蒋胡匪帮的苛捐杂税更是名目繁多，如“保长上县开会费”、“自卫军上县检阅费”、“电杆费”、“修路费”、“乡长来客招待费”、“委员下乡招待费”、“乡民代表招待费”、“驻军运炭费”等等。三原县属长孙乡曲家坡、曲子各家墙上贴的派款条子，仅去年八个月的接起来足够三丈长，而且每张条子上都写有三、四种项目的摊派。此外，尚有户籍不清罚洋六万元，行走没路条罚洋五千元（去年二月以前罚价，现当更增），来客不报罚六个月以下的“徒刑”，或以现款顶替等等敲榨。当地土劣、特务、乡保甲长又把一切负担压在穷人身上，三原县属陷前乡二保厂防村地主刘鲁堂（蒋匪监察院简任秘书）家有六百多亩地，但负担却和该村一个种六亩地的贫农相等。此外又以高利贷及商业投机剥削人民，咸阳县大地主赵奋（其弟赵亭为蒋匪陕西省御用参议员）有地十顷以上，高利放粮三千多石，高陵县伪参议员投机商杨家辉放粮六千石，当蒋匪官府逼粮催款火急时，官僚地主商人即操纵市场，秋后棉花下来，花价即突然猛跌，而麦价却骤然抬高。在蒋胡匪帮这种残暴掠夺下，许多农民弄得家破人亡。泾阳、三原、耀县、长安等广大农村为抵抗蒋胡匪帮这种敲骨吸髓的勒索，近由小孩在村前村后轮流了望，看见带枪催款的队伍走来，便大呼“来了”，全村人民即向野外逃奔。但蒋胡匪帮的“催款队”却乘机到处翻箱倒柜，任意抢劫而去。
    另息：陕南人民武装大小各股，人数共约五六千人。其重要者有“商雒游击司令部”所属之一部，人枪四千七百余，以巩得芳、王烈为正副司令，四六年纵横于陇海路南之山阳、商县、雒南、镇安（上四县已为我陈谢大军解放）、柞水、褒城、凰县、略阳、蓝田等县，曾一度攻入镇安县城，并在商县成立民主政府。此外，又有王子威、王子平、王振杰等十余部共千余人，游击于陇海沿县华阴、渭南、华县、兴平、醴泉、武功、乾县、岐山、＠县、扶风、麟游、凤翔、宝鸡、安阳等县之间。
