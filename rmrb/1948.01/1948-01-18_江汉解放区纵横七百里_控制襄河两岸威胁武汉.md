　　Jianghan Liberated Area Spans Seven Hundred Li
  　Controlling Both Banks of the Xiang River and Threatening Wuhan
    【Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, 16th】A frontline reporter reports on the current situation in the Jianghan Liberated Area, stating: The Hubei, Henan, and Anhui Liberation Army crossed the Pinghan Railway to the west and swept across western Hubei. From December 14th of last year to January 9th of this month, in less than a month, it liberated a vast area with a momentum like thunder, extending from Anlu and Yingshan in the east to Xiangyang and Jingmen in the west, from Sui County and Xiangyang in the north to Heyang and Jianli in the south, spanning seven hundred li and possessing a population of three million. This victory is of utmost significance. Not only did it cause the Chiang bandits to lose the rich areas on both banks of the Xiang River (i.e., the Han River), but it also cut off the highway from Hankou directly to Baoji (after the Longhai Railway was destroyed by us, this road became the Chiang bandits' transportation artery connecting the Northwest and Central China), severing Sichuan and Shaanxi from the Chiang bandit-controlled areas. Furthermore, it prevents the Chiang bandits from effectively supporting the Northwest battlefield and urgently transporting large quantities of Sichuan grain to other frontlines in the future. The Chiang bandit forces in the Jianghan area were originally extremely empty, and the remaining security forces of Hubei Province either fled at the sight of battle or were trapped and annihilated. Their 2nd and 4th Regiments have been successively annihilated in Zhongxiang and Sui County. Last month, when the Liberation Army advanced to the east bank of the Xiang River and approached the Tianmen and Qianjiang area on the outskirts of Wuhan, the Chiang bandits hurriedly drew a part of the 85th Division guarding Wuhan from eastern Hubei to aid in the west. This unit, fearing annihilation by us, had to wander between the Xiang River and the Jing River. In fact, under the powerful offensive of our Central Plains three main forces, the Chiang bandits, lacking sufficient troops, find it extremely difficult to mobilize more troops to the Jianghan Liberated Area. Now the Jianghan Liberated Area is in an extremely favorable situation. After the liberation of Sui County, this area has been connected to the Tongbai Liberated Area, and the vast Liberated Area west of the Pinghan Railway has become even stronger and more powerful. The people of Jianghan, with more than 20 years of revolutionary tradition, are also launching movements to turn themselves over everywhere, destroying feudal rule, following the continuous victories of the Liberation Army. The gradual consolidation and increasing expansion of the Jianghan Liberated Area can be anticipated.

### 江汉解放区纵横七百里　控制襄河两岸威胁武汉

　　江汉解放区纵横七百里
  　控制襄河两岸威胁武汉
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十六日电】前线记者报导目前江汉解放区形势称：鄂豫皖解放军西越平汉路，横扫鄂西，从去年十二月十四日迄本月九日，不到一个月的时间，以迅雷之势，解放了东起安（陆）应（山），西迄襄（阳）荆（门），北至随（县）襄（阳）；南达河（阳）监（利），纵横七百里，拥有三百万人口的广大区域。此一胜利，意义至为重大。不但使蒋匪失去襄河（即汉水）两岸的丰饶地区，而且切断了汉口直通宝鸡的公路（陇海路被我拆毁后，此路曾成为蒋匪联通西北与华中的交通干线），将川陕从蒋匪统治区域割裂开来，并使蒋匪此后不能有效的支援西北战场，和大批运出川粮至其他前线救急。江汉地区的蒋匪兵力，本极空虚，而残留之湖北省保安团队，每战不是望风而窜，即困守受歼，其二、四两总队，已先后于钟祥、随县被歼灭。上月解放军挺进襄河东岸及迫近武汉外围之天（门）潜（江）一带时，蒋匪慌忙从鄂东抽出警卫武汉的八十五师一部西援，该部因怕被我歼灭，只好徘徊于襄河与荆河之间。事实上在我中原三大主力的强大攻势下，兵力不足的蒋贼，要想抽调更多人马到江汉解放区来，已是极其困难了。现在江汉解放区正处在极有利的情况中。随县解放后，本区已与桐柏解放区联成一片，平汉西侧广大解放区至此已更为强大有力，而具有二十余年革命传统的江汉人民，亦正随着解放军的不断胜利，到处展开翻身运动，摧毁封建统治，江汉解放区的逐步巩固和日益扩大，是可以预期的。
