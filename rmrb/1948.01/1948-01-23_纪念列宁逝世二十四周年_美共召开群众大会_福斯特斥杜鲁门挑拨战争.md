Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 21st. TASS, New York, January 18th: The American Communist Party held a mass meeting of 8,000 people here on the 14th to commemorate the 24th anniversary of Lenin's death. American Communist leader Foster delivered a speech at the meeting, stating, "The monopolistic capitalists of Wall Street are instigating an anti-Soviet war, which can only lead to the greatest military disaster in our history." He vehemently criticized Truman for engaging in war provocation in addition to conducting deceptive propaganda domestically. He pointed out, "The United States is directing the wars in Greece and China." Foster emphatically stated, "The new party will awaken millions of voters disappointed with the Democratic and Republican parties, and attract many votes among blacks, farmers, and workers." The audience cheered enthusiastically for Foster. American Communist Party General Secretary Dennis, amidst thunderous applause, continued by saying, "Wallace's participation in the presidential election as a candidate of the new party marks the establishment of a new anti-war, anti-monopoly capital party in the United States." Dennis condemned the Social Democratic Party as careerists who divide workers. He warned that the CIO (Congress of Industrial Organizations) is in danger because it supports the labor movement advisor in the U.S. intervention mission in Greece. He strongly criticized CIO Secretary Carey and AFL (American Federation of Labor) European representative Brown for trying to form "a large trade union of European countries under the Marshall Plan." Black Communist Party City Councilor Davis pointed out at the meeting, "Black people will strongly support the new party across the United States."
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 15th. TASS, New York: The "American Progressive Citizens Association" recently told the press that it is scheduled to hold its second National Congress in Chicago on the 17th and 18th of this month. Six hundred representatives from twenty-six states will attend the conference, representing approximately 100,000 members. It is expected that the conference will support Wallace's presidential campaign and formulate specific plans. The conference will also formulate this year's political action program and elect the association's leaders. Democratic newspapers emphasized that no matter how the reactionary American newspapers spread rumors and propaganda, saying that the association has differing opinions on supporting Wallace, the association remains united. The association's monthly magazine, when discussing the work of this conference, said that the main purpose of the conference is to prevent the United States from heading towards economic depression and war. It also stated, "We should show the world that tens of millions of Americans yearn for peace and hope for democracy." At the same time, the Executive Committee of the American Labor Party has also resolved to support Wallace's campaign and unanimously elected Congressman Marcantonio as the acting chairman of the party. In his speech to the Executive Committee, Marcantonio severely criticized Truman's recent message to Congress requesting universal military training and "aid" to reactionary governments around the world, and said: "Truman's speech finally proves that the two-party system is gone forever."
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 17th. The movement to establish a new party and nominate Wallace as a presidential candidate is unfolding in the United States. According to a TASS report from New York, American democratic forces have already begun to carry out concrete work in this regard. The "Pennsylvania Progressive Committee" has already announced its establishment. The committee consists of two hundred informal representatives from local unions of the CIO, the AFL, the Railroad Brotherhoods, as well as farmers, students, veterans and other groups. In its statement, the committee strongly urged the convening of a National People's Congress to establish a new party. The progressive leaders of the American Slav Congress and the New Jersey branch of the Progressive Citizens Association have also announced their support for Wallace's campaign. The latter also strongly advocated convening a new party congress. Black leaders in Maryland declared that many black people will vote for Wallace to protest the policies of the Democratic and Republican parties.
