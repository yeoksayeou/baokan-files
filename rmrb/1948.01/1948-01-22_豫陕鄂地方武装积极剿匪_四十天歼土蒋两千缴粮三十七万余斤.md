Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Front, 20th: Local armed forces on all fronts are clearing out local bandits and Chiang Kai-shek remnants, forming a mass movement. According to incomplete statistics, in the entire month of December and the first ten days of January, our local armed forces and guerrillas engaged in more than 60 battles against bandits, eliminating 2,456 bandits, seizing four mortars, five grenade launchers, 35 various machine guns, 7,169 rifles and carbines, 253 shells, 206 hand grenades, 45,800 rounds of ammunition, 28 telephone switchboards and handsets, 375,000 jin of grain, and other military supplies. In the Longhai Railway area alone, more than 20 battles were fought, eliminating a total of 1,147 bandits from Wang Keji's and other units. Comrade Li Zhifang, the county head of Xin'an County, led the guerrillas of the Second and Fourth Sub-districts and the militia of the First District, operating actively in the Hengshui area. They also learned to use landmine warfare to kill and wound many bandits, and the military district leaders commended them and issued a circular to all new districts to learn from them. In the Yiyang, Luoning, and Lushi areas, 474 bandits from Ye Laoliu, Feng Kegong, and other units were eliminated successively. In the Yunxi and Yunxian areas, 75 bandits from the 69th Company of the Third General Detachment of the Hubei Security Corps were eliminated. In the Nanzhao, Nanyang, Fangcheng, and Wuyang areas, 760 bandits from the notorious bandit leader Wang Tingfan's and other units were eliminated. In the Sixth and Seventh Sub-districts, the suppression of bandits was combined with the mobilization of the masses. Emancipated peasants often spontaneously gathered in groups of hundreds or thousands to cooperate with the troops in encircling and suppressing bandit lairs. After a county in the Sixth Sub-district disintegrated Chiang Kai-shek's and the landlords' armed forces, it confiscated more than 4,000 rifles. Two counties in the Seventh Sub-district confiscated 2,524 rifles.
