　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Weekly battle situation (8th to 14th). In 1947, the People's Liberation Army won great victories in the northern and southern battlefields, foreshadowing that 1948 will be a year of even greater victories.
    The Northeast People's Liberation Army took a great victory of annihilating three enemy divisions and one army headquarters as the beginning of this year's great victory. Following the Liaoxi Zhangwu campaign before the eve of the Lunar New Year, in which one whole division of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits was annihilated, the People's Liberation Army surrounded the enemy's New Fifth Army Headquarters and the 195th and 43rd Divisions between Xinmin and Gongzhutun outside Shenyang on the 5th. The PLA soldiers charged and fought valiantly in the icy and snowy weather, and finally completely annihilated the enemy in Anfutun, Huangjiashan and other areas on the 7th, totaling more than 16,000 enemy troops. Chen Linda, commander of the New Fifth Army, and the two division commanders, two deputy division commanders, and two chiefs of staff of the army were all captured. The entire battle lasted only 54 hours. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits concentrated fifteen divisions to reinforce, but they were blocked by us on the arc-shaped front of 160 li west of the Shen (yang) Shi (foshan) highway, and they never crossed our predetermined blocking line, and lost more than 4,000 people.
    In this Shenyang outer regiment campaign, bandit leader Chen Cheng concentrated the maximum of half of his entire forty-four divisions in an attempt to make a desperate gamble, but in just 54 hours, his entire deployment was shattered by the People's Liberation Army, which shows the unprecedented strength of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, while Chiang Kai-shek's bandits have reached the end of their road. This campaign also marks the beginning of the People's Liberation Army concentrating greater forces in a region to carry out larger-scale annihilation battles in the future, and accelerating the victorious situation of finally liberating the entire Northeast, going south to the Beining Line, and directly cooperating with the fraternal troops in the Guannei.
    On the southern front: since the Pinghan Longhai Campaign, our three major People's Liberation Armies have met and cooperated in a wide area. Chiang Kai-shek's main forces were either annihilated or beaten to the point of fleeing east and west in a panic, forcing Chiang Kai-shek to transfer the "key defense" troops from the Dabie Mountains to aid the north. Chiang Kai-shek's entire deployment in the Central Plains was disrupted, while the People's Liberation Army completely grasped the strategic initiative and freely chose battle opportunities. Our Hubei-Henan-Anhui army took advantage of the victory to divide its forces and go south, and attacked Suixian County in broad daylight on the 7th, cooperating with the central front army advancing from Mianyang to penetrate the far rear of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits on both sides of the Hanshui River, linking the Jianghan Liberated Area with the Tongbai Liberated Area. Now, a vast area of 700 li in length and width, from An(lu) Ying(shan) in the east to Xiang(yang) Jing(men) in the west, Sui(xian) Zao(yang) in the north, and Mian(yang) Jian(li) in the south, with a population of three million, has been liberated, and the Hanshui River has been blocked, cutting off the Han(kou) Bao(ji) highway, and dividing the water and land connections between Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Sichuan and Shaanxi.
    Since the Hubei-Henan-Anhui, Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui, and Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei three major People's Liberation Armies launched their counter-offensive, they have annihilated more than 160,000 enemy and puppet troops in four months. Now, not only have they gained a firm foothold, but they have also opened up a vast battlefield of more than a thousand li in length and width. The area that was once the heart of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits has now become our new liberated area, and the consolidation and expansion of the new area has laid a solid foundation for the People's Liberation Army to launch another strategic deployment.
    Chiang Kai-shek, due to the successive failures of the battles on various fronts, flew to Han and Shen during the week in a panic, as anxious as ants on a hot pot, while Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency fabricated the "victory" in Western Liaoning. All these only completely exposed Chiang Kai-shek's increasingly deepening military crisis and serious defeat.

　　一周综合战况
    【新华社陕北十四日电】一周战况（八日至十四日）。一九四七年解放军在南北各战场上接连赢得了伟大的胜利，预示着一九四八年将为取得更伟大胜利的一年。
    东北解放军以歼敌三个整师和一个军部的大捷，作为今年伟大胜利的开端。继除夕前辽西彰武战役，歼灭蒋匪一个整师后，解放军复于五日在沈阳门外新民与公主屯间包围敌新五军军部及一九五、四三两个师，解放军勇士在冰天雪地中纵横冲杀，七日终在安福屯、黄家山一带将敌彻底干净全部歼灭，计歼上述敌军共一万六千余人。新五军军长陈林达及该军的两个师长、两个副师长、两个参谋长以下无一漏网。是役前后仅历五十四小时。蒋匪曾集中十五个师增援，但被我阻击于沈（阳）石（佛寺）公路以西长达百六十里的孤形阵线，始终未能越过我预定阻击线一步，且折损四千余人。
    在这次沈阳外团战役中，匪首陈诚最大限度地集中其全部四十四个师的一半兵力，企图作孤注一掷，但仅在五十四小时内，其整个部署即被解放军打得支离破碎，这说明东北解放军的空前强大，而蒋匪则已穷途末路。这次战役更标志着解放军今后在一个地区内集中更大兵力进行更大规模歼灭战的开端，并加速推进最后解放全东北，南下北宁线，直接配合关内兄弟部队作战的胜利形势。
    南线方面：自平汉陇海战役后，我三大解放军在广大地区会师并协同作战，蒋匪主力不是被消灭就是被打得东窜西逃焦头烂额，逼使蒋贼不得不抽调大别山“重点防卸”部队北援。蒋匪在中原的整个部署全被打乱，而解放军则完全掌握战略主动，自由选择战机。我鄂豫皖大军即曾乘胜分兵南下，于七日白昼奔袭，攻克随县，策应中线由沔阳挺进的大军，打入汉水两岸的蒋匪远后方，使江汉解放区与桐柏解放区连成一片。现东起安（陆）应（山），西迄襄（阳）荆（门），北至随（县）枣（阳），南至沔（阳）监（利），拥有三百万人口的纵横七百里的广大地区已获解放，并遮断汉水，截断汉（口）宝（鸡）公路，割裂了蒋匪川陕的水陆联系。
    鄂豫皖、苏鲁豫皖和豫陕鄂三大解放军自出师反攻以来，四个月内已歼灭敌伪十六万人以上，现在不但已站稳脚跟，而且开辟了纵横千余里的辽阔战场，过去蒋匪心脏的地带，现已变为我之新解放区，而新区的巩固和扩大，又为解放军另次战略展开打下巩固的基础。
    蒋贼因各线战事的接连失败，周内曾仓惶飞汉沈两地，急得象油锅上的蚂蚁，而蒋匪中央社复捏造辽西“胜利”，所有这些只不过是完全暴露蒋匪日益加深的军事危机与严重的败局而已。
