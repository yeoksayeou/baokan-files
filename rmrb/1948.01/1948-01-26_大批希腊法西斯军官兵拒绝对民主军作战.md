Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 24th: Athens dispatch: Since the establishment of the Greek Provisional Democratic Government, the people in the fascist puppet government-controlled areas have launched more extensive anti-fascist and anti-war movements. A reporter from the French Communist Party's newspaper L'Humanité reported from his station in Greece: A large number of Greek royalist fascist officers and soldiers have now openly refused to fight against the Democratic Army, and as a result, as many as 20,000 have been thrown into concentration camps, accounting for more than 15% of the Athens puppet government's 130,000-strong army, and 37,000 democrats have been imprisoned in prisons and on "hunger islands" for opposing the war. More than 5,000 patriotic people have been killed. According to a broadcast from the Free Greece Radio Station on the 18th, recently 15 air force officers of the Athens puppet government, unwilling to sell their lives for the royalist fascists, defected to the Democratic Army.
