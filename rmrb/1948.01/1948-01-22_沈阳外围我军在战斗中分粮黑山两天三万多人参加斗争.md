　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 20th: The People's Liberation Army units advancing to fight around Shenyang are distributing grain and land to the masses while fighting. Wherever the People's Liberation Army arrives, the masses immediately launch a fierce struggle to eliminate feudalism. A unit of the People's Liberation Army operating in the southern area of Shenyang helped the masses distribute 150,000 catties of grain and more than 400 pieces of clothing from landlords in one week. Another unit helped the masses confiscate 27 landlord households and distribute 1,800 shi of grain to more than 3,600 poor peasants in six days. A certain unit helped the masses distribute 800,000 catties of grain, more than 20,000 pieces of clothing, and more than 800 quilts from 58 landlord households. In Li Daren Village, 47 long and short guns were also seized from landlords. Many villages and towns are spontaneously organizing struggles, distributing land and starting to establish their own organizations. For example, in a certain village with more than 100 households, 350 people participated in the Turn-Over Association, and in a certain village, more than 100 militiamen were organized in a very short period of time.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th: Late news: On the 30th of last month, the People's Liberation Army entered the city of Heishan in western Shenyang. Despite the severe cold of minus 30 degrees, groups of hungry people were gathered on both sides of the street. Each person carried a pocket, requesting the People's Liberation Army to open granaries and provide relief to the poor. Wherever the People's Liberation Army personnel walked on the street, they were followed by hundreds of poor people asking for grain distribution. The People's Liberation Army immediately sent working groups to conduct investigations and distribute grain. The home of Chief Chen, a local tyrant, landlord, and puppet Manchukuo officer hiding in the city, was even more crowded with thousands of people. The two large iron gates were rushed open by the hungry people, and the grain in the eight large warehouses was quickly distributed. After the news of grain distribution spread, more and more hungry people came, and even teachers and students from the two middle schools in Heishan appeared among the masses carrying grain. Farmers from 30 miles outside the city also rushed to distribute grain. For two whole days, the streets and alleys of Heishan were filled with people distributing grain. According to incomplete statistics, in two days, out of more than 50,000 people in Heishan County, more than 35,000 people participated in the struggle, and 43,000 people received the fruits of victory. 39 local tyrants were divided, and more than 2,500 shi of grain, 8,200 pieces of bean cake, more than 50,000 pieces of clothing, more than 30,000 catties of cotton, 12,000 catties of oil, and more than 50,000 catties of coal were distributed.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 20th: After the People's Liberation Army of the Jianghan Military Region captured Suixian County, it immediately assisted residents in seizing the houses of the Western Pass that had been set on fire by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, opened warehouses, and provided relief to poor peasants inside and outside the city. When residents saw the People's Liberation Army, they accused the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army of setting fire to the streets before being annihilated. On the evening of the 6th, as soon as the guns of the People's Liberation Army sounded, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the city sent company and platoon leaders to the Western Pass, ordering every household to light up their lamps, and then ordered the houses of the Western Pass to be burned. The Chiang Kai-shek military officers ignored the pleas of the people of the entire pass kneeling and kowtowing, dispersed the people, immediately ordered the bandits to set fire, and set up machine guns on the city wall, aiming at the people who were rushing to move their own things. Cries of grief were heard everywhere, a tragic scene beyond description. Chen Zhenji's 14-year-old child was shot and killed, burned beyond recognition, and Wan Yihong and six others were injured by machine gun fire. The People's Liberation Army entered the city gate and immediately helped residents put out the flames in the streets and carried out appeasement. On the 7th, more than 10,000 poor peasants inside and outside the city received grain, and they happily said: "In the past, we could only carry grain into the city, but we have never carried grain out of the city."

　　沈阳外围我军在战斗中分粮黑山两天三万多人参加斗争
    【新华社东北前线二十日电】挺进沈阳四周作战的解放军各部，一面战斗，一面发动群众分粮、分浮。解放军所到之处，群众即掀起猛烈的消灭封建的斗争。活动沈（阳）南一带的解放军某部，一周内帮助群众分了地主十五万斤粮食，四百余件衣服。另部六天中帮助群众没收地主二十七户，三千六百余贫苦农民分粮一千八百石。某部帮助群众分了五十八户地主，群众分得粮食八十余万斤、衣服二万余件、被子八百余条。在李大人屯并起出地主长短枪四十七支。许多村屯群众，自动组织斗争，分浮分地并开始建立自己的组织，如某屯居民百余户，即有三百五十人参加翻身会，某屯很短时间内组织了百余民兵。
    【新华社东北二十日电】迟到消息：上月三十日解放军进驻沈西黑山县城，虽在零下三十度的严寒中，大街两旁仍聚立着一群群饥饿的人们。每人身上都背着一条口袋，纷纷请求解放军开仓济贫。解放军人员在街上走过，身后都跟着数百要求分粮的贫民。解放军立刻派出工作组进行调查和分粮。隐藏在城内的恶霸地主伪满军官陈团长家里，更拥挤了上千的群众，两扇大铁门被饥饿的人们一冲打开，八间大仓库的粮食很快就被分掉。分粮消息传出后，饥民越来越多，甚至连黑山两级中学的教员、学生也出现在扛粮的群众里。城外三十里的农民也赶来分粮。整整两天黑山城的大街小巷都挤满了分粮的群众。据不完全统计，两天中黑山全县的五万余人，有三万五千余人参加了斗争，四万三千余人得到了果实，被分土劣三十九户，分出粮食两千五百余石，豆饼八千二百块，衣物五万余件，棉花三万余斤，油一万二千斤，煤五万余斤。
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线二十日电】江汉军区解放军攻克随县城后，立即协助居民抢劫了蒋匪纵火焚烧的西关民房，并开放仓库，救济城内外贫苦农民。居民看到解放军时，纷纷控诉蒋匪军在被歼灭前放火烧街的罪行。六号晚上，解放军的枪刚刚打响，城里的蒋匪就派了连排长到西关，命令家家户户都点起灯来，接着又下令烧西关的民房，蒋匪军官不顾全关老百姓跪地叩头请求，反把老百姓打散，立即叫匪兵放起火来，并在城墙上架起机枪，对准抢搬自己东西的老百姓射击，一时哭声四起，惨不忍闻，居民陈斟记十四岁的孩子被打死，烧得不辨人形，万翊洪等六人均被机枪打伤。解放军进入城关，马上帮助居民扑灭各街的火焰，进行安抚。七日，城内外一万多贫苦农民分得了粮食，他们都欢喜的说：以前我们只能把粮食背进城里，从来没有把粮食从城里背出城外。
