　　Nanzhuang Exposes False Reports by Village Cadres
  　Resolves Funding Difficulties for Employing the Poor
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] The cadres of Nanzhuang Village in the Second District of Changzhi County were complacent and failed to resolve the funding difficulties for employing the poor in winter production, resulting in a poorly organized winter production effort. At a meeting of key members of the employed poor held on the 22nd of last month, the difficulties faced by the employed poor in winter production were examined. Huang Pangqing, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, stated: "Our village's production is very lively. The reason that only a few of the employed poor are not participating in production is due to their lack of ideological understanding." The cadres' false reports were immediately exposed by the employed poor. Shen Lai'an said: "There are fourteen households in my group, but only three have livestock. Those who have livestock all have their own ways. When I suggested that we go into production, they refused, and it couldn't get started. They're relying on begging again next year, acting as if they hadn't been emancipated." Chen Shui's mother said: "My group wanted to buy livestock and asked me to invest. I don't have the money to invest. If I sell grain, I'm afraid of going hungry again. Everyone says I lack ideological understanding, to the point where I don't even dare to speak in the group." After these problems were discovered, an immediate investigation was conducted. Among the seventy-five households of the employed poor, there were sixty-five laborers, but only eighteen were engaged in production. It was also found that the distribution of loans was unfair. The village received a total of 410,000 yuan in loans, but one wealthy farmer and five middle farmers received 270,000 yuan, while the employed poor only received 140,000 yuan. After the investigation, the cadres made self-criticisms. Huang Pangqing, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, said: "I was muddle-headed and thought our village's winter production was underway. I didn't realize that the employed poor were facing such great difficulties. I've been emancipated myself, but I haven't been earnestly serving the employed poor." The leadership also made self-criticisms and proposed to allocate all loans to the employed poor. After the employed poor received the loans, winter production in the village began to pick up. For example, Yang Guangde, an employed poor person, borrowed 100,000 yuan and the next day organized twelve employed poor households to sell bowls, five households to spin rope, and ten households to sell coal and charcoal. Everyone was working with great enthusiasm.

　　南庄揭穿村干假报告
  　解决雇贫资金困难
    【本报长治讯】长治二区南庄村干部思想自满，没解决雇贫冬产资金困难，冬季生产没有很好组织起来。上月二十二日召开雇贫骨干会议，检查冬季生产中雇贫的困难，农会主席黄胖庆说：咱村生产搞的很喧，少数雇贫没去生产，是他们思想不通。村干部的假报告立即被雇贫揭穿，申来安说：“我组有十四户，只有三个牲口，但有牲口的都是有办法的。我说咱去生产吧，人家不去，搞不起来，凭住明年再要饭吃，只当是没有翻身。”陈水只母亲说：“我组要买牲口，叫我入股，咱没钱入不起股，卖粮食又怕再挨饿，大家说咱思想不通，弄的我在组内连话都不敢说了。”发现这些问题后，当即检查，在七十五户雇贫中，共有劳力六十五人只有十八个出去生产。又发现贷款分配不公，全村共贷款四十一万元，一户富农，五户中农就贷有二十七万，雇贫只贷了十四万。检查后干部做了检讨，农会主席黄胖庆说：“我思想糊涂认为咱村冬季生产搞开了，没有想到雇贫还有这样大的困难，自己翻了身，没有认真给雇贫办事。”领导上也做了自我批评，提出要把贷款完全贷到雇贫身上，雇贫得到贷款后，该村冬季生产开始活跃起来。如雇贫杨广德，贷了十万元贷款，第二天就结合了雇贫十二户卖碗，五户纺绳，十户卖煤、炭，大家干的劲头很大。
