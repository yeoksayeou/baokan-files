　　Poor and Hired Laborers Did Not Rise Up, Winter Production Failed
    Guowu Township's Fifth District Summary Lacks Class Character
    [Wuxiang News] The secretary of the Fifth District Committee of Wuxiang and the district chief, together with several cadres, inspected the winter production work for the past month on the 29th of last month, and found that hired and poor laborers in some villages had not truly taken power. The district can be divided into three types of villages: The first type has more than ten villages, which are the best villages. Hired and poor laborers have actually taken power to lead mass production, and their enthusiasm is very high. For example, in Yuan Village, there are 82 female full and semi-laborers and 81 male full and semi-laborers. They started mutual aid production at the beginning of this month, organizing men to transport goods and engage in other side businesses. Women are weaving. In just 27 days, they have earned more than 2,066,600 yuan, with each labor group earning an average of 12,700 yuan. (Is it that some people are getting more and others are not getting enough? This calculation method is inappropriate. – Editor) This winter, they will not only be able to complete the county's requirement of earning an average of 20,000 yuan per laborer, but they are also confident of exceeding it. (Having production achievements and being able to complete tasks does not mean that hired and poor laborers have taken power. Have hired and poor laborers actually taken power? What are the specific manifestations? – Editor) At the same time, four or five very poor third-class villages were inspected, and the masses' enthusiasm for production was not high. The main reason is that cadres have turned the hired and poor laborers' taking power into formalism and a task-oriented view, failing to mobilize the hired and poor laborers ideologically and solve their specific difficulties, but instead bestowing favors and taking over everything. The production enthusiasm of middle peasants is also not high. For example, after the village cadres of Duan Village accepted the task of hired and poor laborers taking power from the district, they widely announced to the masses in the village that the hired and poor laborers are now in power and middle peasants cannot be cadres, and then considered the matter finished. (Simply handing over the task of mobilizing hired and poor laborers to organize production to the village cadres, and doing things badly, the leadership should also examine their own class stand and bureaucracy. – Editor) The hired and poor women in the village have no way to engage in winter production because they spend their days gathering firewood, boiling water, and pushing grindstones, but this is not being resolved. The village cadres and the masses go to chop firewood together. The masses all chop firewood, but the cadres return empty-handed. The cadres only shout slogans and do not actually solve the difficulties of the hired and poor laborers. Therefore, the hired and poor laborers cannot rise up, and the middle peasants do not move either. Zhang Baoyun, the chairman of the Wangjiagou Cooperative, is an old middle peasant. The cooperative cannot do things for the masses. However, when the comrades from the district went to the village to transform the leadership, they immediately convened the masses to elect a new leader without any mobilization. As a result, they elected Wu Jinshu, a hired and poor laborer, as the chairman of the cooperative. He is actually very good, but he has never managed village affairs and is too weak to dare to do anything. Because the masses had not been mobilized, they did not believe he could do it, and as a result, he was replaced in less than ten days. The cadres in Chengguan Village do not help the hired and poor laborers find ways to organize their production, but simply give them loans. The hired and poor laborers believe that if they take the money without doing anything, they will have to pay interest, so twelve hired and poor households dare not take the loans. In addition, some village cadres carry the burden of being veteran cadres and do not go deep into their work, so they cannot see the problems in the village. They always say that there are no problems in the village and that the production enthusiasm is very high, but after inspection, the difficulties of the hired and poor laborers have not been completely resolved. After research, the district cadres were all shocked and realized that there were many problems in the village. Therefore, they proposed to break with complacency and, instead of just shouting the hired and poor laborer line, to actually go deep into the hired and poor laborers, specifically solve practical difficulties, and continue to implement winter production.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Li Fang, Ruo Tao, Jin Ren)
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    What exactly is the problem with winter production? How to solve it? It is necessary to analyze it from the perspective of class character. Can breaking with complacency solve the problem? Are the difficulties of the hired and poor laborers simply that they have no time to produce because they are gathering firewood and pushing grindstones? Is it simply that they have no loans? Only criticizing village cadres and individual district cadres for not mobilizing the hired and poor laborers, and the leadership not truly understanding the situation of the hired and poor laborers, this kind of leadership method should first conduct self-criticism.

　　贫雇没有抬头冬季生产落空
    国武乡五区总结没有阶级性
    【武乡消息】武乡五区分委书记和区长在上月二十九号和几个干部共同检查一月来的冬季生产工作，发现一部村雇贫并未真正掌权。全区可分三类村：第一类村有十余村，是最好村，雇贫实际上当了权领导群众生产，劲头很大。如原村全村女全半劳力八十二人，男全半劳力八十一人，从本月初开始互助生产，组织男人运输，并搞其他副业。女人纺织，到现在仅二十七天，共赚洋二百零六万六千余元，每组劳力平均赚洋一万二千七百元。（是不是有人得的多？还有人得不上？这样算法不妥当。——编者）。今冬不但能完成县里每个劳力平均赚洋两万元的要求，并且有把握的能超过。（生产有成绩，能完成任务并不等于雇贫掌了权。雇贫究竟掌权没有？具体的表现究竟是什么？——编者）同时也检查出四、五个很差的三等村，群众生产劲头不大，主要原因是干部把雇贫掌权变成形式主义和任务观点，不从思想上发动雇贫和具体解决雇贫困难，恩赐包办。中农生产情绪也不高。如段村村干部在区上接受了雇贫掌权，回村便广泛给群众宣布，现在是雇贫掌权，中农不能当干部，就算了事。（把发动雇贫组织生产的任务简单交给村干部，事情做坏了，领导上同样也要检查自己的阶级立场和官僚主义。——编者）该村雇贫妇女每天拾柴、烧水、推碾磨没法搞冬季生产不去解决。村干部和群众相跟去砍柴，群众都砍上柴，干部却是空回来。干部只是嘴上喊叫，不实际解决雇贫困难，因此雇贫起不来，中农也不动。王家沟合作社主席张保云是个老中农，合作社不能给群众办事，但区上同志去该村改造领导，不经过发动，马上召集群众选举，结果选了个雇贫武金书同志当合作社主席，实际很好，但是他自己没管过村里事，自弱的不敢干。群众因没有经过发动，也不相信他能干，结果没过十天又换了。城关村干部不给雇贫想办法组织他们生产，单纯的给雇贫贷款，雇贫认为拿上钱没做的又出利，就有十二户雇贫不敢要贷款。另外又有一部分村村干部背的是老资格包袱，不深入工作，因此看不出村里问题来。老说村里没问题，生产情绪很好，但经检查雇贫困难还没有彻底解决了。经研究后，区干部一致惊醒，村里问题很多，因此提出打破自满，与嘴上空喊雇贫路线，要实际深入雇贫，具体解决实际困难，继续贯彻冬季生产。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（李芳、若涛、晋仁）
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    冬季生产的问题究竟在那里？怎样解决？要从阶级性上去分析。打破自满是不是能解决问题？雇贫的困难是否就是拾柴推碾没功夫生产？是否就是没贷款？只批评村干部个别区干部不会发动雇贫，领导上又未去真正了解雇贫情况，这种领导方法应该自己首先做检查。
