Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th – The Northwest People's Liberation Army Headquarters and Political Department recently issued an order to allocate land and property to liberated soldiers. Political organs at all levels should compile a roster of liberated soldiers and soldiers from non-liberated areas, detailing their names, ages, native places, land, and family population. They are responsible for properly preserving these rosters. Once a soldier's hometown is liberated, the local democratic government should be notified to ensure the liberated soldier receives the same land and property allocation as local farmers. For liberated soldiers who unfortunately sacrificed during the Liberation War, land and property will also be allocated in the same manner as a pension for the martyr. The order also stipulates that political organs at all levels should communicate this decision to every liberated soldier and every soldier from the Kuomintang areas who has joined the People's Liberation Army.
