【Taihang News】According to reports from correspondents in Shexian, Huguan, Zuoquan, and Neiqiu counties: After the Land Law Outline reached the villages, some landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to exploit loopholes, eating and drinking extravagantly and trying to sabotage it. In some places, poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants spontaneously rose up to expose these conspiracies and adopted necessary control measures. However, some places have not yet been alert to this problem. In Beiliangtun, Neiqiu, the landlord heard that he would be given a share and walked differently than before, swaggering around everywhere, becoming rampant for a time. To prevent the landlords from making trouble, the poor peasants and hired laborers proposed dividing the work between men and women during discussions of the Land Law, and everyone monitoring the activities of the landlords. Liu Qiufu, the landlord of Guozhuang Village, Shexian County, heard that the Land Law Outline had been promulgated, and he stole the newspaper while the village teacher was not at home. After reading it, he couldn't sleep and started singing in bed early in the morning. The female landlord Wang Qiao'e heard that the land would be divided equally and everyone would get a share, so she called her sister back to wait for a share (her sister had left her grandmother's house last year after the struggle). The masses in the village pointed at her and said, "You fellow, you take advantage of every opportunity. Whether we give you a share is our business. If you don't bow your head, it won't work!" Hao Xianzhi, a rich peasant in Tongtan Town, Zuoquan, heard that the land was going to be divided equally, so he hurriedly ground the wheat he had harvested into flour and ate seven meals of dumplings in a row. No one controlled this illegal behavior of his. The masses in North Xingtou, Huguan, established an inspection committee to register and prevent landlords from selling or wasting resources before the equal distribution. If any landlord engages in sabotage, in addition to being stopped on the spot, they will also settle accounts with him during the equal distribution.

　　北行头成立巡查委员会
  　制止地主破坏土地法
    【太行消息】据涉县、壶关、左权、内邱等县通讯员报导：土地法大纲到了村里，有些地主富农便乘机钻空子，大吃大喝，想法破坏；有些地方贫雇与中农自动起来揭发这种阴谋，并采取了必要的管制办法。有些地方对这个问题却还没有警惕注意。内邱北良屯的地主听说要给地主分一份，走路和以前也不一样了，翘起膀子到处跳，一时猖狂起来。贫雇为防止地主捣乱，便在讨论土地法时，提出了男女分工，大家监视地主活动的办法。涉县郭庄村的地主刘秋福听说土地法大纲颁布了，他乘村里教员不在家将报纸偷去，看了以后，连觉都睡不着，早早的就在被窝里唱起来了。女地主王巧的听说平分土地每人都有一份，便去把她妹妹叫回来等着分一份（她妹妹在去年斗争罢，就跟她奶奶另走了一家）。村内的群众指着她说：“你这家伙见空就钻，给你分一份是我们的事，你要不低头，可不行！”左权桐滩镇富农郝献芝听说要平分，忙将自己打下的麦子推成面，连着吃了七顿扁食。他这种非法的行为竟没有人管。壶关北行头群众成立了巡查委员会，登记与防止地主在平分前的偷卖浪费等破坏活动，如有地主进行破坏，除当场制止，还要在平分时和他算总帐。
