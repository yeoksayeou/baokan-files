Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. A Shanghai newspaper's Beiping dispatch reported on the public trial of a secret agent by students of Beiping Normal College, stating: On November 6th of last year, after the college decided to hold a one-day strike in protest of the murder of martyr Yu Zisan at Zhejiang University, more than 20 KMT secret agent students from China University suddenly stormed into the Normal College in large trucks. Inside the student union, they snatched the list of students who supported the strike and various documents, and beat eight students. As the secret agents were hurriedly getting into the trucks after the attack, one of them was tripped by a stone and captured by Normal College students. A dagger, a KMT party membership card and badge, several secret orders, and payment receipts were found on him. Public outrage was ignited, and he was immediately tied up and put on public trial in the playground, with over a thousand people watching. The secret agent confessed that his name was Yuan Wei, he was from Jinghai, Hebei, and was a third-year law student at China University, as well as an executive committee member of the 24th District Branch of the KMT in Beiping. He stated that he was ordered to come and disrupt the anti-oppression movement and investigate the list of striking students. When asked why he carried a dagger, he said that he always carried a handgun, dagger, and iron ruler with him wherever he went. At this point, the surrounding students were extremely agitated and shouted loudly to beat him. Finally, a unanimous resolution was passed demanding that the KMT publicly apologize to the students, compensate the injured for medical expenses, and guarantee that it would no longer instigate its followers to use bloody means against students.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. According to a Shanghai newspaper report: The Shanghai Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities officially established the so-called "Flying Fortress" fascist special police system on November 17th of last year. It is claimed that "the mission of this organization is to suppress special incidents, conduct surprise inspections (such as hotels, bridge strongholds, etc.), execute emergency orders, patrol important areas, and provide special guard duties." This agency was designed by Yu Shuping, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit police chief and secret service leader. Yu openly stated: "Cases such as street vendor incidents, student unrest, and labor unrest all require such a special organization to suppress them." This move shows the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's growing fear of the rising tide of popular resistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. Belated news: The International Student Union launched a fundraising campaign in Prague to support students from China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Spain, Greece, and other countries who are struggling for their countries' independence, democracy, and peace. They designated November 11th to 17th of last year as Fundraising Week, and the 17th as "International Students' Day." The fundraising goal was 2 million Czech crowns. In other news: Chinese students in the UK held a representative conference in London in October of last year. At the meeting, in addition to denouncing the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' bloody crimes of massacring students, they unanimously passed a resolution opposing the KMT's fake election in November.

　　北平师院学生公审蒋党特务
  　国际学联募款支援我国学生
    【新华社陕北十七日电】沪报北平通讯报导北平师范学院学生公审特务情形称：年前十一月六日，该院为抗议浙大于子三烈士被害，决定罢课一天后，忽有中国大学特务学生二十余人乘大卡车闯入师院，在自治会内抢走该校赞成罢课学生名单及各种文稿，并殴伤学生八人。行凶后当各特务正慌忙上车时，其中一人被石头绊倒，为师院学生捕获，当场在身上搜出匕首一把、蒋党党证及党徽各一、密令及领款条数件，群情激愤，当即将其绑至操场公审，围观者千余人。该特务供称：姓元名伟，河北静海人，现为中国大学法律系三年级学生，兼任平市蒋党二十四区分部执行委员。此次系奉命前来破坏反压迫运动及调查罢课学生名单。问他为什么带匕首，他说到什么地方都带上手枪、匕首、铁尺的。此时围观学生情绪沸腾高声喊打。最后一致决议要求蒋党公开向学生道歉，赔偿受伤者医药费，并保证以后不再嗾使其党徒以血腥手段对付学生。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据沪报消息：上海蒋匪当局已于去年十一月十七日，正式成立所谓“飞行堡垒”的法西斯特警制。据称：“此项组织之任务，为镇压特殊事件，突击检查（如旅馆、桥梁要隘等等）执行紧急命令，巡视重要地区及特种警卫等”。该机构由蒋匪警察局长特务头目俞叔平所设计。俞公开表示：“象摊贩案件，学潮事件，工潮事件，都需要有这样一个特殊机构来镇压”。此举显示蒋家匪帮对人民反抗怒潮日益高涨之恐惧。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】迟到消息：国际学联在布拉格发动筹募基金运动，以支援为祖国独立、民主、和平而艰苦奋斗的中国、印尼、越南、西班牙、希腊等国学生，并定年前十一月十一日至十七日为劝募周，十七日为“国际学生日”。募捐目标为捷币二百万元。另讯：中国留英学生年前十月间在伦敦召开代表大会，会上除痛斥蒋匪屠杀学生的血腥罪行外，并一致通过决议，反对蒋党十一月间伪选。
