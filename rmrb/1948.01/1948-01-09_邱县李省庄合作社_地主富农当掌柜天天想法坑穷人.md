　　[Jinan News] In Li Shengzhuang, Qiu County, landlords and rich peasants have seized power in production, constantly harming the poor masses. Among the nine cadres of the village cooperative, the manager, accountant, and purchasing agent are all rich peasants who have been struggled against. Among the workers in the cooperative's oil press, there is one landlord and two rich peasants. The oil carriers used are also mostly from landlords. The oil press has good food and drink and also operates a gambling den. From October, the oil press made 150 stacks of oil in 80 days, earning a gross profit of 630,000 yuan, but spending 563,000 yuan on expenses alone, leaving a net profit of only 60,000 yuan. Since the cooperative is controlled by landlords, their hearts are with the landlords, and they immediately gave more than 30,000 yuan to the households being struggled against from the money earned. When the higher authorities issued loans of 400,000 yuan, the landlord managers did not lend to those who were poor, but to those who had "understanding" of the cooperative, resulting in all the loans going to rich and middle peasants. In the autumn, the bank issued another 900,000 yuan in loans, which they all put into the cooperative, and the dividends were distributed according to the amount of shares. Wu Zaichao and other 18 poor peasant households had no shares and could not receive dividends. The poor people do the hard work in the cotton ginning room, but the dividend distribution method is 4.5 points for the bow, 3 for the donkey, and 2.5 for the person. The people and donkeys eat their own food, and the repair of the bow is the responsibility of the bow owner. Ginning cotton can earn 8,000 yuan a day, but after food, each person only has 560 yuan left per day. Two animals, after fodder, only have 1,250 yuan left per day. A foreign bow costs 30,000 yuan in repairs in seven months, netting 3,458 yuan per day. This method makes the hard-working poor suffer and benefits the rich who have tools. The poor people have seen through it and are very dissatisfied. The landlord purchasing agent Yang Chunlin took a person to Nangong to buy dyestuff, making a trip every seven days, taking both cars and sedan chairs, but the dividends were distributed 40% to the person and 60% to the money, with each person receiving a net of 30,500 yuan. The second time they bought dyestuff, they lost 120,000 yuan, all of which was charged to the cooperative. When the poor wanted to withdraw their shares, the landlord cadres of the cooperative threatened, "You kid are sabotaging!"

　　邱县李省庄合作
    地主富农当掌柜天天想法坑穷人
    【冀南消息】邱县李省庄在生产中地主富农掌了大权，处处坑害贫苦群众。村里合作社九个干部，经理、会计、购买员都是被斗富农，社内的油坊工人中有一个地主，两个富农，用的油挑也多是地主。油坊里好吃好喝，还开着赌场。油坊从十月份起，八十天内打了一百五十个垛，赚毛利六十三万元，但光盘费就用了五十六万三千元，净赚只六万多元。合作社既是地主握大权，他们心就向地主，赚的钱马上就给了被斗户三万多元。上级发下贷款四十万，当掌柜的地主更不按谁穷贷给谁，而按谁对合作社有“认识”，结果都贷给富农和中农了。秋天时银行又发给贷款九十万，他们全数入社，红利按股本多少分，吴在朝等十八户贫农没股，就不能分红。弹花房做出力活都是穷人，但分红办法是弓分四点五，驴分三，人分二点五，人驴是吃自己的，修理弓归弓户。弹花一天能赚八千元，一个人除吃，每天只剩五百六十元。两个牲口除草料，每天只剩一千二百五十元。洋弓七个月花修理费三万元，每天净落三千四百五十八元。这种办法，苦了出力穷人，好活了有工具的富人，贫苦人都看透了，很不满意。地主购买员杨春林带一人往南宫办颜色，七天一趟，又坐汽车又雇轿车，却是人四、钱六分红，每人净分三万零五百元。第二次办颜色赔了十二万，都算到社里，穷人要抽股，合作社的地主干部，便威胁说：“你这小子破坏啦！”
