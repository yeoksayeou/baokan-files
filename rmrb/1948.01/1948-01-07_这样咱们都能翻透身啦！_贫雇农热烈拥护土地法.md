　　"This way we can all turn ourselves over completely!"
    Poor and landless peasants enthusiastically support the Land Law
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The "Outline Land Law of China" promulgated by the Communist Party of China has been enthusiastically supported by peasants. The peasants of Chengguan, Licheng said: "This way we can all turn ourselves over completely!" When the newspaper carrying the "Outline Land Law" arrived in Chengguan, Licheng, people crowded around the oil lamps of various offices, organizations, schools, and shops; some read, and those who couldn't understand asked others to read it aloud. Poor peasant Ren Xinnian said: "The struggle against landlords last year was not thorough; the cadres discussed it first, taking care of the landlords' lives. The distribution was also unfair. The landlords' dog food was better than the peasants' meals, I saw it with my own eyes after herding sheep for more than ten years." Middle peasant Wang Shengcai said: "The landlord Wang Tianzhang and Li Baoyuan oppressed people for a lifetime, and only after the New Year and winter did they turn out just over ten mu of land. He obviously had silver dollars, yuanbao, and possessions, but he would rather die than take them out. In the autumn, four large vats were dug out from under his cellar, can you see how hateful the landlord is!" Poor peasant Li Jinde said: "In the past, landlords and rich peasants had a lot of land, and out of the twenty households in our street, eighteen were being exploited by those two families. Do you think that's equality! In the past, the land distributed to schools and organizations was all good land, this time let's divide it equally, with this land, it will be almost enough to make up for our needs." More than two hundred peasants in Chengjiashan Village, Second District, studied the "Outline Land Law" in the winter school, and everyone argued about the matter of giving land to landlords. Farmhand Xiao Rui said: "We must first satisfy the demands of us peasants, then we can give him a share. This is the leniency of us peasants towards the landlords." The peasants of Sanwang Village, Wu'an, were very satisfied with "drawing from the surplus to make up for the deficit" and "drawing from the fertile to make up for the barren" when they heard the cadres read the "Outline Land Law." Poor peasant Zhang Liutang said: "Equality, equality, it won't be evened out if it's done wrong like this."
    　　　　Understanding it yourself before explaining it to others
    Judging from some reports, there are still incorrect understandings and propaganda regarding the Land Law in some places. Contribution from Zuoquan: After the newspaper arrived, the Fourth District Committee convened a symposium of cadres from various systems to discuss the Land Law. Comrade Zhao Zhankui said: "After hearing this report, my ideological problems have been resolved!" "On the same morning, we received a letter from the County Committee, convening a meeting of main village-level cadres in the entire district to convey the Central Land Law Outline," "The District Committee decided to hold meetings of village branch secretaries and main cadres in three locations" to convey the message. "Comrade Li Guifu was so happy that after the symposium in the morning, he took the newspaper with him when he went to the countryside!" We feel that: explaining the Land Law Outline should be very cautious and meticulous. We should thoroughly clear the cadres' minds, rectify the ranks, and establish the fundamental concept of serving poor and landless peasants, only then can we understand the true meaning of the Land Law. It is impossible to clear one's mind after just one symposium. Although this enthusiasm for rushing down to the villages to convey the message is not bad, it seems that there is some impatience. Impatience will certainly not be able to correctly convey the Land Law to the peasants, let alone correctly implement the Land Law Outline. According to reports from correspondents Lu Jinsen and others: Licheng Chengjiashan used the Land Law Outline to "stabilize the peasants' emotions and promote winter production." After discussing it in the winter school, "the next day the entire village's winter production was vigorously more enthusiastic than before." Poor peasant Cheng Yuquan said: "In the past, I thought I was preparing for struggle, still waiting to share the fruits... This year, I have to work hard in production and take the lead." The implementation of the Land Law Outline is to rely on poor and landless peasants to overthrow the landlord class, completely divide the land, and fully satisfy the demands of poor and landless peasants. However, the village has used the Land Law as a tool to promote winter production; it's completely irrelevant. We hope that the responsible parties in Licheng will conduct an inspection and see what misunderstandings or distortions of the Land Law exist in various places, and conduct corrections and education at any time.

### “这样咱们都能翻透身啦！”　贫雇农热烈拥护土地法

　　“这样咱们都能翻透身啦！”
    贫雇农热烈拥护土地法
    【本报消息】中国共产党公布的中国土地法大纲，受到农民的热烈拥护。黎城城关的农民们说：“这样咱们都能翻透身啦！”登着土地法大纲的报纸到了黎城城关，各机关、团体、学校、商店的油灯下围满了人，有的看，看不懂的请别人念。贫农任新年说：“去年斗地主就不彻底；是干部先讨论一下，照顾地主生活。在分配上也不公道。地主的狗食比农民的饭还好，我放了十来年羊，是亲眼见到的。”中农王生才说：“地主王天章、李保元压迫了一辈子人，在年时冬天才搞出他十来亩地。银元、元宝和东西，明知道他有，他能死也不拿。秋天在他窖底下刨出四个大缸，你看地主可恨不可恨！”贫农李金德说：“过去地主富农地多，咱街二十户，就有十八户是给两家受的。你看平等不平等！以前学校机关分的地都是好地，这次平分吧，有了这些地，就差不多够补用了。”二区程家山村二百多个农民在冬学里研究土地法大纲，对于给地主分地的事，大家争论起来。雇农小锐说：“总得先满足了咱农民的要求，可以给他分一份。这是咱们农民对地主的宽大。”武安三王村的农民听干部念土地法大纲，对于“抽多补少”、“抽肥补瘦”顶满意。贫农张留堂说：“平等，平等，错这样不能均了。”
    　　　　自己懂得了再给人解释
    从一些消息看来，有些地方对土地法的认识和宣传还有不正确的地方。左权来稿：报纸到后四区区委会召集各系统干部座谈土地法，赵占魁同志说：“听了这篇报，可是解决了我思想问题啦！”“当日上午就接到了县委来信，召开全区村级主要干部会议，传达中央土地法大纲”，“区委会决定分三个地点，召开村支书及主要干部会议”传达。“李贵富同志因高兴的不得了，早上座谈罢，下乡走时连报纸也给拿走啦！”我们觉得：解释土地法大纲要十分谨慎、细心，应该彻底打通干部思想，整顿好队伍，建立起为雇贫服务的根本观念，才能懂得土地法真正的意思，经过一次座谈就打通了思想是不可能的，急着下到村里传达，这种热情虽然不坏，看来恐怕有些急性病。急性病一定不能正确传达土地法给农民，更不能正确的执行土地法大纲。另据通讯员路进森等人报导：黎城程家山用土地法大纲“稳定了农民情绪，推进了冬季生产”。在冬学里讨论后，“第二天全村的冬季生产都轰轰烈烈的较前起劲了。”贫农程雨宽说：“我过去心想是准备斗争，还等着分果实哩……今年可得在生产中好好干，起带头”。执行土地法大纲是为依靠贫雇农打倒地主阶级彻底平分土地，充分满足贫雇农要求，该村却把土地法当做了推动冬季生产的工具；驴头不对马嘴，希望黎城负责方面做一检查。并看看各地对土地法有什么误解或曲解，随时进行纠正和教育。
