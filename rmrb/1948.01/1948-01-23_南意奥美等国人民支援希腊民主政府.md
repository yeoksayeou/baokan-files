Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: A comprehensive report from Athens states that after the establishment of the Greek Provisional Democratic Government, the US-British imperialists are attempting to rescue their Greek puppets and are carrying out extremely vicious intervention. According to TASS: US imperialism has dispatched a large number of warships to reinforce the Mediterranean, including the aircraft carrier "Midway," carrying 2,000 Marines and several cruisers, preparing to land in Greece if necessary to help the Athens puppet government make a last-ditch struggle or suppress the increasingly high tide of the Italian democratic movement. At the same time, the United States has increased aid to Greece for military spending, actively helping the Athens puppet government expand its army, and frantically suppressing the labor movement. This has aroused the indignation of democratic people around the world, and a movement to aid Greece is booming. The Executive Board of the United Food and Tobacco Workers Union of the CIO in Philadelphia, USA, with 100,000 members, passed a resolution protesting this outrage by the US authorities and demanded that Truman and the State Department "stop all economic and military aid to the Greek royalist government." In order to support the Greek democratic movement, the broad masses of the people of Yugoslavia established the People's Committee to Aid Greece in Belgrade a few days ago. At the closing of the Sixth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party, Italian Communist leader Togliatti called on the Italian people to support the Greek Democratic Army. The Austrian Association of Anti-Fascist Fighters for Freedom held a meeting in Vienna, the capital of Austria, on the 13th to support Greece's struggle for independence and freedom. Professor Lajues, representing the Vienna Greek Anti-Fascist Committee, addressed the meeting and said: "The formation of the democratic government headed by General Markos is powerful evidence of the growth of democratic forces in Greece and the Greek people's victory in winning independence and freedom." He called on all democrats beneficial to the interests of the people and fighting democratic Greece to unite as one.

　　南意奥美等国人民支援希腊民主政府
    【新华社陕北十九日电】综合雅典讯：希腊临时民主政府成立后，美英帝国主义妄图抢救其希腊走狗，正进行穷凶极恶的干涉。据塔斯社讯：美帝国主义已派大量军舰增防地中海，其中包括“中途”号航空母舰，上载有两千名海军陆战队，及若干巡洋舰，准备于必要时登陆希腊，帮助雅典伪政府作垂死挣扎，或镇压日益高涨着的意国民主运动。同时，美国又增加援希军费，积极帮助雅典伪政府扩军，并疯狂镇压劳工运动。因而激起世界民主人士的义愤，一个援希运动正蓬勃开展。美国费城拥有十万会员的产联粮食烟草工会执行局、特通过决议抗议美当局的此种暴举、并要求杜鲁门与国务院“停止对希腊保皇党政府的一切经济与军事帮助”。南斯拉夫广大人民为支援希腊民主运动，于日前在贝尔格莱德成立了援希人民委员会。意大利共产党领袖托格里亚蒂在该党最近六次全国代表大会闭幕时，呼吁意大利人民声援希腊民主军。奥地利争取自由的反法西斯战士会，特于十三日在奥京维也纳召开了声援希腊争取独立与自由的会议。拉觉斯教授代表维也纳希腊反法西斯委员会在会上致词称：“以马科斯将军为首的民主政府之组成，是希腊民主势力成长与希腊人民将赢得独立与自由的有力证据”。他号召有益于利民主人士与战斗的民主希腊团结一致。
