Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 14th: This agency's reporter, Mu Xin, reports on the four-month counter-offensive situation on the Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei battlefields, stating: Since the People's Liberation Army crossed the river on August 23rd of last year, it has advanced a thousand miles south, operating in the vast area south of the Yellow River, north of the Han River, and west of Pinghan (Beijing-Hankou) Railway, achieving four consecutive victories on the western section of the Longhai Railway, the outskirts of Luoyang, the eastern foothills of Funiu Mountain, and the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. On the western front, our army moved south along the ridges of Funiu Mountain and Qinling Mountains, crossed the Dan River, and liberated Shanyang and Zhen'an in southeastern Shaanxi. On the eastern front, our army crossed the Luo River, Yi River, Ru River, Sha River, Bai River, and Tang River, reaching the foothills of Tongbai Mountain, capturing Biyang and Tongbai, with advance troops reaching the Han River bank in northern Hubei. In mid-September, in the first round, our army wiped out six of the eight regiments belonging to the Chiang bandit's Shaanxi Eastern Corps, and the commander-in-chief, Xie Fusan, was dismissed by the Chiang bandits. In early November, the entire 15th Division was completely annihilated, and the division commander, Wu Tinglin, a local tyrant from western Henan with the rank of lieutenant general, was captured alive. In late December, in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, our forces cooperated with the Su-Lu-Yu-Wan (Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui) Army to completely annihilate the Chiang bandit's 5th Army Corps headquarters and the entire 3rd Division. The enemy commander-in-chief, Li Tiejun, fled in a panic.

At the beginning of our army's crossing of the river, there were nine regular enemy brigades on the Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei battlefields. About seven brigades have been wiped out so far. After Li Tiejun's 5th Army Corps was annihilated on the eastern front, the Chiang bandits still have three divisions and six brigades. On the western front, Pei Changhui's Shaanxi Eastern Corps has been replenished to four divisions and seven brigades. In total, the Chiang bandits have seven divisions and thirteen brigades on the Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei battlefields. Chiang bandit's 30th Division and others, who are invading eastward along the Longhai Railway, are trapped in isolated cities along the line, feeling as if they are sitting on pins and needles. Chiang bandit's 65th Division and others, following the Shaanxi Southern Liberation Army, are wandering on the banks of the Dan River. Chiang bandit's 1st Division, which invaded the Lushi mountainous area for "encirclement and suppression," has also achieved nothing in the past two months.

In total, by the end of December, in four months, a total of more than 56,000 Chiang bandit regular and local troops were annihilated, thirty-six county towns liberated, a population of more than nine million liberated, and the liberated area stretched six hundred li from east to west and a thousand li from north to south, connecting with the two major liberated areas of Su-Lu-Yu-Wan and E-Yu-Wan (Hubei-Henan-Anhui) in a vast area. The entire territory's strategic locations have been completely controlled by us. Now, we can threaten Xiangfan to the south, control Tongguan and Luoyang to the north, cooperate with the two major armies of E-Yu-Wan and Su-Lu-Yu-Wan to the east, and form a mutually supporting relationship with the Northwest Liberation Army, creating favorable conditions for flexible maneuverability and large-scale annihilation of the enemy in the future.

Currently, the Liberation Army has firmly established itself in the Funiu Mountain area and is entering a stage of consolidation. Various difficulties in the newly liberated areas are gradually being overcome. Eight sub-districts and administrative offices, more than forty democratic county governments, and the highest political power organ, the Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei Administrative Office, have been established in the entire area. In the past four months, democratic government workers and PLA commanders and fighters have vigorously carried out activities such as opening granaries to help the poor and distributing grain and land, igniting the flames of the people's liberation everywhere. In a sub-district along the Luo River, land distribution has now progressed to the stage of "leveling and supplementing," thus arousing the people's heartfelt support for the democratic government and the Liberation Army. In the battle in the eastern foothills of Funiu Mountain and the large-scale sabotage war in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, the peasants who had initially turned over in areas such as Fangcheng, Lushan, Yancheng, and Xiping, automatically participated in the war to transport the wounded. Wherever the army went, peasants voluntarily joined the army with guns. A large number of young students and people in the education field also participated in the Liberation Army and the work in the liberated areas. People's guerrillas are flourishing. In early October, peasants in four counties of a sub-district seized 927 rifles from landlords. In another sub-district, more than 800 peasants joined local armed forces and militias to protect the fruits of their liberation, and cooperate with field corps to suppress bandits and local bullies, causing most of the bandits to disappear.

　　伏牛山已成巩固解放区
  　记者报导陈谢大军反攻形势
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十四日电】本社记者穆欣报导豫陕鄂战场四个月反攻形势称：去年八月二十三日，解放军渡河以来，南进千里，驰骋于黄河以南，汉水以北，平汉以西广大地区，先后在陇海西线、洛阳外围、伏牛东麓、平汉南段四战四捷。西线我军沿着伏牛山和秦岭的脊峰南下，横渡丹江，解放陕东南的山阳、镇安。东线我军越过洛河、伊江、汝河、沙河、白河、唐河，到达桐柏山麓，攻克泌阳、桐柏，先头部队抵达鄂北汉水沿岸。九月中旬，我军在第一个回合中，就把蒋匪陕东兵团所属八个团歼灭了六个，总指挥谢辅三被蒋贼撤职。十一月初彻底歼灭整十五师，生擒该师中将师长豫西土霸王武廷麟。十二月下旬在平汉南段，又配合苏鲁豫皖大军全部歼灭蒋匪第五兵团团部及整三师，敌总指挥李铁军落荒而逃。
    我军南渡之初，豫陕鄂战场原有敌正规军九个旅，先后被歼约七个旅，东线李铁军第五兵团被歼后，现东线蒋匪尚有三个师六个旅，西线裴昌会陕东兵团又补充至四个师七个旅，豫陕鄂战场蒋匪合计七个师，十三个旅，沿陇海东犯的蒋匪三十师等，正困守沿线孤城，如坐针毯。尾随陕南解放军的蒋匪六十五师等，则徘徊于丹江岸边；侵入卢氏山区“清剿”的蒋匪第一师，两月来亦无所获。
    总计至十二月底，四个月中，共歼灭蒋匪正规军及地方军五万六千余名。解放县城三十六座，解放人口九百余万，解放区东西长六百余里，南北阔千里，与苏鲁豫皖、鄂豫皖两大解放区在广大地区连成一片。全境军略要地已为我完全控制，现我南可威胁襄樊，北可控制潼洛，东与鄂豫皖及苏鲁豫皖两支大军协同作战，并与西北解放军互为猗角，形成今后灵活机动大量歼敌的有利条件。
    现解放军已在伏牛山区立稳脚跟，并进入巩固阶段。新解放区各种困难逐渐克服，全区建立了八个分区和专员公署，四十多个民主县政府及最高政权机构豫陕鄂行政公署。四个月来，民主政府工作人员，及解放军指战员，大力进行开仓济贫、分粮分地，到处点燃群众翻身的烈火。洛河沿岸某分区，分配土地现已进至“填平补齐”阶段，因而激起了人民对于民主政府及解放军的衷心拥戴。在伏牛山东麓战役，及此次平汉南段大破击战中，方城、鲁山、郾城、西平等地区初步翻身的农民，自动参战转运伤员，大军所至，农民纷纷自动带枪参军，大批青年学生及教育界人士，亦参加解放军及解放区工作。人民游击队蓬勃发展，某分区四个县的农民，十月初旬，即自地主手中夺取步枪九百二十七支，另一分区有八百余农民参加地方武装及民兵，保卫翻身果实，配合野战兵团剿捕散匪土顽，使大部地区土匪为之匿迹。
