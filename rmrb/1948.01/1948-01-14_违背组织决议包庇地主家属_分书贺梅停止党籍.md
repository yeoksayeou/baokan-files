　　【Taiyue News】 The Wenxi County Committee has expelled He Mei, a class alien element who sabotaged organizational resolutions and failed to deeply guide the landless peasants and poor peasants in their emancipation movement, from party membership and revoked his work. He Mei came from a landlord background, and his family had already been struggled against. He served as the secretary of the Second District Committee and was also a member of the County Committee. He was arrogant, passive in his work, and stuck to old ways. He was not concerned about the emancipation of landless and poor peasants and planned to have the cadres under his leadership collectively bring their families to the old revolutionary base area. Ten cadres brought in twenty-one family members, more than the number of cadres in the Second District, undermining the County Committee's resolution that no one could go home to bring their families or get married for three to five months during the major movement. He Mei also took in a girl from a family that was struggled against and whose father had been killed, making her a maid for his mother. The masses were very dissatisfied with this. One of the cadres in the Second District was a war criminal. At the County Committee's cadre expansion meeting, it was decided that he should arrest the war criminal, but he pretended to comply while secretly releasing him. At the liaison meeting of district instructors on December 3, everyone pointed out his problems and asked him to thoroughly reflect. Instead of reflecting after the meeting, he didn't even do his work. This time, even after being criticized, he remained obstinate, downplaying the seriousness of his mistakes, and his several speeches showed no sincerity in reflecting. Finally, in order to strictly enforce discipline, everyone decided to expel He Mei from party membership and revoke his work.

  　分书贺梅停止党籍
    【太岳消息】闻喜县委会停止破坏组织决议、不深入雇贫指导翻身运动的阶级异己分子贺梅的党籍，撤销其工作。贺梅出身地主成份，家庭已被斗争，他担任二区分委书记并为县委委员之一，自高自大，工作消极，老一套。他对雇贫翻身不关心，有计划的和他领导下的干部集体到老根据地接家眷。十个干部就叫来二十一个家属，比二区的干部还多，破坏了县委会关于大运动中三个月至五个月不准回家接家属及结婚的决议。贺梅又收留被打死的斗争对象的女孩，给他母亲当使女，群众对此很不满，二区有一个干部是战犯，县委扩干会上决定要他把战犯逮捕起来，他却阳奉阴违，暗地释放了。在十二月三日各区指导员接头会议上，大家给他提出来要他彻底反省，他下去不但不反省，连工作也不做了。这次对他批评，他仍执迷不悟，避重就轻，几次发言，毫无反省诚意。最后为了严整纪律，大家决定停止贺梅党籍，撤销他的工作。
