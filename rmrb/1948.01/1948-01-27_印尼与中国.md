　　Indonesia and China
　　The People's Daily Reference Room
　　After the Japanese devils surrendered, Dutch imperialists, supported by U.S. imperialism, attacked the Indonesian people, suppressing the Indonesian people's national liberation movement. Chiang Kai-shek acted as an accomplice to the U.S. and Dutch imperialists, shamelessly engaging in traitorous diplomacy to please his American daddy. On December 6th of last year, he signed an aviation agreement with the Netherlands, allowing Dutch planes to fly freely over China, using Shanghai, Tianjin, Kunming, and Guangzhou as their airports; selling aviation rights to his American daddy and to the Dutch bandits. In the Security Council, Chiang's representative even proposed that India and the Netherlands each designate a representative, and that India and the Netherlands select a third country's representative to form a committee. This was exactly the same as the proposal made by the Dutch representative. This was an attempt to deny the Security Council's right to deal with the Indonesian issue and to open a separate path for his American daddy to "mediate" (interfere in Indonesia) alone, fully supporting U.S. and Dutch efforts to split Indonesia. On the third day after this conspiracy to split Indonesia was proposed, Chiang Chia-tung, Chiang's consul-general in Batavia, colluded with the Dutch and, without Indonesia's consent, established a so-called "Overseas Chinese Security Corps" special agent organization in the Dutch-occupied areas of Indonesia. At the same time, he demanded that Indonesia also agree to establish a similar special agent organization in the Indonesian liberated areas, but the Indonesian government refused. Chiang Kai-shek established such a special agent organization and prepared to expand it in order to provoke discord between the Indonesian people and the overseas Chinese, to facilitate the aggression of U.S. and Dutch imperialism. A little over ten days after this special agent organization was established, more than 6,000 overseas Chinese fled from the Dutch-occupied areas to the Indonesian liberated areas for refuge; recently, nearly a thousand overseas Chinese compatriots were brutally murdered by the Dutch imperialists, and thousands of overseas Chinese compatriots were arrested and subjected to torture. From this, we can see the ferocious face of the Dutch imperialists and the ugly face of Chiang Kai-shek as their accomplice.
　　The Chinese people and the Indonesian people stand on the same front, resolutely opposing the aggression of U.S. and Dutch imperialism and the fascist rule of Chiang Kai-shek. The Chinese people in Indonesia are very harmonious with the Indonesian people, caring for and sympathizing with each other. For example, the more than 6,000 overseas Chinese who fled from the Dutch-occupied areas of Indonesia due to persecution by Dutch and Chiang special agents were received and assisted by Indonesia when they arrived in the Indonesian liberated areas. In addition to providing food and finding accommodation, they were also given medical treatment. In August of last year, Indonesia promulgated a law protecting overseas Chinese; subsequently, the Indonesian representative also declared in the Security Council that the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the Indonesian region would be protected. The Chinese people in Indonesia, along with the Indian and Filipino people who sympathize with the Indonesian people's liberation movement, formed international columns and fought alongside the Indonesian army to resist the Dutch imperialist aggression. The Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army organized by the Chinese people in Solo also participated in this just resistance. The Chinese people in Yogyakarta donated a large amount of money, sugar, and clothing to the Republic of Indonesia as war funds to support Indonesia's protracted resistance. After this major bloodshed created by the U.S., Dutch, and Chiang forces, the overseas Chinese compatriots in Indonesia will inevitably be more vigilant against the conspiracies and tricks of the U.S., Dutch, and Chiang forces, and will surely join hands with the Indonesian people to fight against the common enemy.

　　印尼与中国
  　本报资料室
    日寇投降后，荷兰帝国主义者就受美帝支持向印尼人民进攻，压制印尼人民的民族解放运动。蒋介石则做了美荷帝国主义者的帮凶，无耻的实行卖国外交，以求得他美国爸爸的欢心。于去年十二月六日与荷兰签订了航空协定，使荷兰飞机也可在中国上空任意飞行，并以上海、天津、昆明、广州四地为其机场；把航空权卖给了他美国爸爸，又卖给荷匪。在安理会上，对印尼问题，蒋贼代表并提议由印、荷各指定一国代表，并由印、荷挑选一第三国之代表，合组一委员会。这和荷代表提出的一模一样。这是企图否认安理会有处理印尼问题之权，并为他美国爸爸单独出面“调停”（干涉印尼）另开一条小路，全力支持美荷分裂印尼。这种分裂印尼阴谋提出的第三天，蒋驻巴城总领事蒋家栋和荷兰勾结，未经印尼同意，擅自在印尼荷占领区成立所谓“华侨保安团”的特务组织。同时更要求印尼也答应在印尼解放区成立同样的特务组织，印尼政府拒绝了他。蒋介石之所以成立这样特务组织，并准备扩大特务组织，是想挑拨印尼人民和华侨间的和睦关系，以便利美荷帝国主义的侵略。这个特务组织成立后十多天，就有六千多华侨从荷占领区逃往印尼解放区避难；最近又有近千侨胞被荷帝惨杀，数千桥胞被逮捕受苦刑，从这就可看出荷帝的凶恶面貌与蒋介石的帮凶丑相。
    中国人民和印尼人民是站在一条战线上的，坚决反对美、荷帝国主义的侵略及蒋介石法西斯统治。在印尼的中国人民，和印尼人民十分和睦，相互爱护、同情。如从印尼荷占区被荷、蒋特务迫害而逃出的六千多华侨，到了印尼解放区，印尼就予以收容救济。除发给粮食、代找住处外，并予以医药治疗。在去年八月间，印尼颁布了保护华侨法令；接着，印尼代表又在安理会声明保护印尼区内华侨生命、财产的安全。而在印尼的中国人民与同情印尼人民解放运动的印度人民及菲律宾人民，则组成国际纵队，与印尼军并肩作战，抵抗荷帝的侵略。在梭罗的中国人民组织的华侨自愿军也参加了这一正义的反抗。在日惹的中国人民曾向印尼共和国捐输大量金钱、食糖及衣料品等，作为战争基金以支援印尼持久抗战。这次美、荷、蒋制造大血案后，在印尼的侨胞，必然会更警惕美、荷、蒋的阴谋诡计，而且必将和印民人民更拉紧手与共同商人作斗争。（舫）
