　　Checking Bureaucracy
　　Guo Wenzhang, a poor hired laborer from Wu'an, had his wife seized by a rich peasant cadre. After fighting the lawsuit for two years and experiencing all kinds of bureaucracy from all levels of government, he finally said, "No place handles things according to the principles of the poor." This sentence paints a portrait, and we all need to take a good look at it.

　　Guo Wenzhang exposed three types of people: The first type is Wang Wenyi, the chairman of the farmers' association. He was a local tyrant in the past and still is now. Wearing the hat of "chairman of the farmers' association," he oppresses hired laborers and does all sorts of evil, casually seizing the wives of poor people. Because of District Chief Guo's landlord background, no one dares to touch a hair on his head. The second type is Section Chief Zhao of the judicial department and District Chief Zhao, who eat the people's public grain and still scold the people. They are handling official business in the government office and don't want to do things for the poor. "The district government can't fight with the district government, and the village can't have conflicts with the village." In his mind, the government is an anti-people sectarian force. In Guo Wenzhang's words, it's called a "corporate government," and this sectarian force doesn't even give the poor hired laborers "two cents of justice." The last type is people who are full and idle all day long, like the county magistrate who can read the newspaper but doesn't bother with the poor people who come to him to file complaints. Even at the special commissioner's office, they can only hear two "fair" words that don't really solve the problems for the poor. The upper levels push it down to the lower levels, and the lower levels are the same. The democratic government is controlled by these people, "officials protecting each other," mutually shielding each other, "all those who talk and laugh are landlords, and there are no poor hired laborers who come and go." They only support Wang Wenyi and don't support Guo Wenzhang. Where can the poor speak?

　　We all need to stand firm, sweep away bureaucracy, thoroughly investigate Guo Wenzhang's grievances, expose all the hidden local rich peasants, and continue to expose all events that violate the interests of the poor in various places. We have not made enough efforts in this area in the past. From now on, this newspaper and the news agency sincerely wish to be the spokespersons for the poor. We welcome poor hired laborers and all aggrieved poor people to speak out all the grievances and everything they want to say and publish it in the newspaper. The Central Bureau and the Border Region Government support you and will stand up for you. Anyone who tries to retaliate will be severely punished.

### 检查官僚主义

　　检查官僚主义
    武安雇贫郭文章，老婆被富农干部霸占，官司打了两年，尝遍了各级政府各式各样的官僚主义，最后说了一句话：“没有一个地方按穷人道理办事”；这句话算是画了一个像，我们都要求好好地照照看。
    郭文章揭发了的有三种人：第一种人是农会主任王文义，过去是恶霸，现在还是恶霸，拿上“农会主任”大帽子，欺压雇贫，无恶不作，随便霸占穷人妇女，靠土地主出身的郭区长，谁敢动人家一根毛。第二种人是司法科长和赵区长，吃老百姓公粮还要骂老百姓，他们办的是衙门里的公事，不想给穷人办事情，“区公所不能同区公所闹蹩扭，村上不能与村上起矛盾”。他心目中的政府是反人民的大宗派，按郭文章的话说，叫作“团体政府”，这个宗派对贫雇是连“二分公理”也不讲。最后一种是饱食终日无所用心的人，比如县长可以看报，却不去理睬找上门来告状的穷人，到了专署也只能听到两句不真正替穷人解决问题的“公道话”。上边推到下边，下边又是如此，民主政府被这些人把持住，“官官相卫”，互相包庇，“谈笑皆地主，往来无贫雇”，只替王文义撑腰，不给郭文章作主，请问哪里还有穷人讲话的地方？
    我们大家都要站稳立场，扫清官僚主义，彻底把郭文章的冤曲弄个水落石出，把隐藏着的地方富农都亮出来，继续揭发各地一切违反穷人利益的事件。我们过去在这方面也未做努力。今后本报及通讯社诚心诚意的愿做贫苦人的代笔人，欢迎贫雇农及一切受委曲的穷人把肚子里一切冤曲，一切想说的话都讲出来，登在报上。中央局和边区政府都替你们撑腰作主，谁要是想来报复，那就要严办他。
