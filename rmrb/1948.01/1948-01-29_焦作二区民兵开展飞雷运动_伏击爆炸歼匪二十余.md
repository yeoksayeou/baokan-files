　　Jiaozuo Second District Militia Launch "Flying Thunder" Movement
  　Ambush Explosions Eliminate Over Twenty Bandits
    [Taihang News] The male and female militia of the Second District of Jiaozuo are currently carrying out a "two thousand Flying Thunder" movement, actively and proactively attacking the enemy. They are burying "Flying Thunders" near enemy strongholds and setting up ambushes, combining the two to strike at invading enemies. Female militia members Liu Fengqin and Lian Xiuying, along with three others from Longdong and Madigou villages, buried six "Flying Thunders" north of Dongxi Wangfeng near an enemy stronghold on the 15th of this month. At dawn the next day, our Second District, the Central and Western Joint Defense Militia Transportation Team, the Seventh Detachment, the Taihang Southern Detachment, and parts of the armed village militias, ambushed the enemy north of Dongxi Wangfeng. Around sunrise, the enemy puppet township government self-defense force, in coordination with a portion of the enemy's regular army, totaling over one hundred and fifty men carrying five machine guns, divided into three routes to seize grain in our Second District's mountain area. When the enemy entered the forward edge of our pre-arranged ambush position, our Jinliu Militia Transportation Team immediately launched a fierce attack on the enemy, scattering them in disarray, causing them to turn and flee in chaos, immediately triggering three "Flying Thunders," blowing the enemy sky-high. Our militia clapped and cheered with delight.
    In this engagement, a total of twenty-five enemies were killed, blown up, or wounded, while we suffered no casualties, creating an exemplary battle record of zero to twenty-five, which was praised by the Jiaozuo Xiuwu Border Area Joint Command. (Wu Rong, Zhe Ying)
