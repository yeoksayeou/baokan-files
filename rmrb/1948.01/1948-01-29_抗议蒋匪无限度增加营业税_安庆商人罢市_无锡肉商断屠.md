Xinhua News Agency, East China, 25th: Shanghai newspapers report: Anqing merchants, in protest against Chiang bandit's unlimited increase in business tax, went on strike for two days starting from the 12th of last month. Last year, Chiang bandit originally set the business tax for the city at 1 billion yuan (Chiang currency), later increasing it to 2.255 billion yuan. When Li Pinsheng, the Chiang bandit's chairman of Anhui Province, inspected in November, it was further increased to 5 billion yuan, and a "Tax Collection Work Team" was organized to forcibly investigate the accounts of various shops and extort money from them. Merchants throughout the city, unable to bear the Chiang bandit's exploitation, rose up and went on strike. In Wuxi, the Chiang bandits originally set the slaughter tax for each pig at 65,000 yuan (Chiang currency). In late January, it was increased to 80,000 yuan, and on the 25th, it was increased again to 90,000 yuan. Butchers and fresh meat merchants, in protest against this exorbitant tax, ceased slaughtering and went on strike from the 22nd of last month, and the matter remained unresolved as of the beginning of this month. Furthermore, in Fuzhou, personnel from the Chiang bandit's district offices, due to long overdue salaries, went on strike collectively on the 19th of last month, gathering in a procession to petition the Chiang bandit's municipal government.

    【新华社华东二十五日电】沪报讯：安庆商人，为抗议蒋匪营业税无限度增加，上月十二日起罢市两天。该市去年营业税，蒋匪原定为蒋币十亿元，后增至二十二亿五千五百万元，至十一月蒋匪皖省主席李品仙视察时，又增到５０亿元，并组织“税捐工作队”，强迫调查各商店帐目，从中勒索。全市商人不堪蒋匪压榨，遂起而罢市。无锡蒋匪原定每头猪的屠宰税，为蒋币六万五千元，上月下旬增为八万元，二十五日再度增至九万元，屠宰商及鲜肉商为反抗此项苛税，自上月二十二日起即断屠罢市，至本月初仍未解决。又：福州蒋匪各区公所人员，因薪水久欠不发，上月十九日全体罢工，集队前往蒋匪市府请愿。
