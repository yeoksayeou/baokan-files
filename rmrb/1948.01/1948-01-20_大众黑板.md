    Last December, the Central Bureau, the highest leading organ of our Border Region's Communist Party, convened a land conference for the entire region. This conference primarily addressed the issue of how to help our peasants divide the land and achieve liberation. At this meeting, nine representatives were elected to form a preparatory committee for the Border Region Peasants' Association. This is because in the future, our villages, districts, and counties will establish peasant representative conferences, and all the peasants in the Border Region will be organized together to establish a region-wide peasant representative conference. This matter is not simple. Our Border Region is vast, and no one knows everyone. To organize a large conference, we must elect people who truly work for the peasants to prepare for it. This is the origin of the Border Region Peasants' Association Preparatory Committee. Today, this preparatory committee issued a "Letter to the Peasants," telling our peasants how to achieve liberation. In the past, our liberation was not well done, and land was not divided fairly because our peasants were not well organized, and in some places, landlords and rich peasants had infiltrated. The future approach is that first, our poor and hired peasants must closely organize together to form poor peasant leagues, and then unite the middle peasants well to establish peasants' associations, so that we can overthrow the landlords. This letter to the peasants will be distributed to the villages, and every peasant must read it carefully, especially our poor and hired peasants. If you are illiterate, ask someone to read it to you. If we understand the principles stated in the "Letter to the Peasants," we can properly handle the thorough and equitable division of land. Only then can we truly liberate ourselves.

    去年十二月，咱们边区共产党的最高领导机关中央局，召开了全区土地会议。这个会主要解决了如何帮助咱们农民分土地闹翻身的事情。在这个会上，选举了九个代表成立了一个边区农会筹备委员会。这是因为咱们将来村里区里县里都要成立农代会，全边区的农民也都要组织到一块成立一个全边区的农代会。这件事就不简单，咱们边区地方很大，谁也认不的谁，要想组织到一＠来开个大会，就得选几个真正为农民办事的人来筹办一下，这就是边区农会筹备会的来由。今天这个筹备会发表了一篇“告农民书”，告诉咱们农民怎样能翻了身。过去咱们的翻身没弄好，土地没分公，是因为咱们农民自己组织的不好，有的地方地主富农也混进来了。今后的办法是首先咱们贫雇农要紧紧组织到一＠，成立贫农团，再好好把中农团结住，成立起农会来，才能把地主打倒。这篇告农民书发到村里，咱们每个农民都要好好看，特别是咱们贫雇农更要好好看，不识字要请人念。懂得了“告农民书”上面说的道理，咱们就能把彻底平分土地这件事办好。咱们自己也才能真正翻身。
