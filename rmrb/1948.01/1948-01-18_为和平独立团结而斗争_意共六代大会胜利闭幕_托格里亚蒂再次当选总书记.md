In his closing remarks, Togliatti strongly stated: "This congress exposed the war-mongers such as American imperialism and the Vatican." He emphasized: "Italy should enjoy full international freedom, which is indispensable for restoring Italian independence." He strongly criticized the Gasperi government's shameful inaction regarding the American attempts to militarily interfere in Italy. He also denounced the malicious slander that the Italian Communist Party was attempting to incite unrest in order to delay the elections.
    According to the Credentials Committee of the Sixth Congress on the 9th, 782 delegates participated in the congress, representing 2,283,048 party members. Among them were 108 female representatives and 422 representatives who had fought in the guerrillas.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th] Rome dispatch: The Sixth Congress of the Italian Communist Party sent a telegram on the 7th to thank the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) for its congratulatory telegram to the congress. It stated: "In order to thank the Soviet delegation for bringing fraternal congratulations to the congress, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to you. Our party is struggling for peace and the people's democracy, and is striving tirelessly to unite all democratic and patriotic forces of the Italian people under the banner of freedom, independence, and friendly relations with all countries. We deeply know the decisive contribution made by the Bolshevik Party under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Stalin to promote our cause. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and its Central Committee, the heroic Soviet people have built the world's first socialist society and are continuing to advance, opening up the road to victory for the forces of peace, democracy, and freedom in the world. Our party and the Italian working people will do everything possible to promote the realization of the great ideals of Italy's future independence and progressive democracy."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th] According to TASS, Rome dispatch: Italian Communist leader Togliatti delivered an important summary report at the closing meeting of the Sixth Congress of the Italian Communist Party on the 10th. He first pointed out: This congress was conducted under the following slogans: struggle for peace, independence, and economic recovery, and struggle for the freedom and unity of the Italian people. Togliatti said: "We need peace, so the speakers at the meeting have been fiercely exposing the war-mongers; the Italian people need unity, so the congress has formulated methods to restore and maintain the unity of democratic forces. The Communists have reiterated their willingness to join forces with the Socialist Party to prevent the destruction of the unity of the working class, which is the bulwark of democracy." Togliatti continued: This congress also engaged in formulating election strategies for the upcoming elections and preparing for the elections. The Communists are eager for the elections. At the same time, we are organizing the Italian people to crush all provocative actions that may come from any side. Togliatti strongly stated: "There is every reason to expect that the Gasperi government may postpone the elections again as before, so the Communists and all democratic forces in Italy must be vigilant and supervise the government to keep its promises." Nicagavi, a spokesperson for the Italian Communist Party's Political Bureau, announced: The Italian Communist Party's future strategy lies in mobilizing the masses through the People's Democratic Front to repel and defeat the attacks of the reactionaries.

　　为和平独立团结而斗争
  　意共六代大会胜利闭幕
    托格里亚蒂再次当选总书记
    【新华社陕北十三日电】米兰讯：意共第六次全国代表大会历时六日，已于十日胜利闭幕。意共领袖托格里亚蒂再次被选为该党总书记。托氏在闭幕词中力称：“本届大会揭穿了美帝国主义及梵蒂冈等战争贩子。”并强调指出：“意大利应享有充分的国际自由，这种自由对恢复意国独立是不可缺少的。”在论及加斯贝利政府对美国企图武装干涉意大利的阴谋毫无反应的可耻行为时，托氏予以强烈的抨击。并痛斥外间所谓意共为了拖延选举企图煽起骚动的恶意诽谤。
    又据六代大会资格审查委员会九日宣布：参与大会代表计七百八十二名，代表该党党员二百二十八万三千零四十八人。其中有一百零八名妇女代表，有四百二十二名代表曾在游击队中作过战。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】罗马讯：意共六代大会于七日致电答谢联共中央委员会对大会的贺电。内称：“为了答谢苏联代表团带给大会兄弟般的祝贺之忱，谨向您们致衷心的感谢。我党正在为和平、和人民的民主而斗争，并为了将全意人民的一切民主和爱国势力团结在自由独立和一切国家友好邦交的旗帜下而奋斗不懈。我们深知在伟大领袖斯大林同志领导下的布尔什维克党，对促进我们这一事业所作的决定性的贡献。在布尔什维克党及其中央委员会领导下，英雄的苏联人民已建设了世界上第一个社会主义社会，并正在继续迈进，为全世界和平民主与自由的势力开辟了走向胜利的道路。我党和意大利劳动人民将竭尽一切努力，以促进意大利未来独立与进步民主的伟大理想的实现。”
    【新华社陕北十四日电】据塔斯社罗马讯：意共领袖托格里亚蒂十日在意共第六次全国代表大会闭幕会上，发表了重要的总结报告。首先指出：这次大会是在如下的口号下进行的，即为和平、独立和经济复兴而斗争，为意大利人民的自由与团结而斗争。托氏说：“我们需要和平，因此会上的发言者一直猛烈揭发战争贩子；意大利人民需要团结，因此大会拟定了恢复和保持民主力量团结的方法。共产党人已重申他们的意愿，愿与社会党联手迈进，以防止破坏工人阶级的团结，而工人阶级的团结，乃是民主的堡垒。”托氏继称：这次大会也曾从事制定不久就将举行的选举策略，并准备选举的事宜，共产党人对选举抱有热望。我们同时正在把意大利人民组织起来，以粉碎可能来自任何方面的一切挑拨行动。托氏力称：“有一切理由预计到加斯贝利政府可能再象以前那样将选举延期，因此共产党人和意国的一切民主力量必须警惕，并监督政府使之践约。”意共政治局发言人尼加维宣布：意共今后的策略，在于经过人民民主阵线发动群众，击退并打垮反动派的进攻。
