　　Investigating Class Background and Attitude in Battle
　　Replacing a Battalion Leader Afraid of Death
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The People's Liberation Army × unit investigated class background and attitude in battle, and removed two battalion leaders from rich peasant backgrounds who were afraid of death and spoke sabotage. Battalion leader Wang Erbao was from a rich peasant background (name hidden, original surname Liu). When he joined the army, he attempted to desert. The previous time in the ×× trench, soldier Zhang Luoxiang bravely shouted to the enemy, but Wang Erbao timidly went to Zhang Luoxiang and whispered, "Don't shout, don't shout! What if the enemy hears us, finds our target, and fires artillery?" During the battle to intercept reinforcements, the enemy fired two shots, and he was so scared that he buried his head in the dirt, stuck his butt up, and cowered, afraid to move. He was afraid of death, unable to command and control the team, and shamelessly said, "I'd rather get hit in the ass than the head." In battle, he said strange things: "Suffering this is not as good as going back on a stretcher!" When soldiers criticized him, he even said, "I've been backward like this for a long time, are you just finding out now?" Qiu Qinglin was from a rich peasant background, had deserted before, and after being forced to return to the team, he said, "I've been a soldier for seven or eight years and I'm still a soldier, I can't even be a squad leader." At that time, the class line was not clear, and without considering background and battlefield performance, only looking at qualifications, and due to a shortage of people, he was promoted to small artillery squad leader. His thinking was bad, he didn't know how to manage a team, the whole squad was not united, and problems often occurred. In the previous battle, he performed even worse; he fired fifty of eighty shells. He didn't measure the distance when firing, didn't look at the point of impact, and didn't organize the soldiers to fire, wasting the shells. At night, he abandoned three soldiers in front to act as guards, and cowardly ran to a small cave in the back to sleep all night. In the trench, when soldier Wang Shu'er was singing for fun, he wouldn't let him sing, and even insulted the soldier, undermining the soldier's morale.
　　After the battle, at the battle appraisal meeting, the soldiers exposed Wang Erbao's and Qiu Qinglin's shameful acts of being afraid of death, and believed that they were not qualified to be battalion leaders. If they were battalion leaders, they would only lead the team astray. Based on everyone's opinions, the leadership announced their dismissal on the spot.

　　战斗中查阶级查态度
  　撤换贪生怕死班长
    【本报消息】人民解放军×部在战斗中查阶级查态度，把两个贪生怕死，说破坏话的富农成份的班长撤职。班长王二保是富农成份，（隐姓、原姓刘）参军时他企图乘机开小差。前次在××战壕里，战士张落祥英勇的向敌人喊话，王二保胆怯的到张落祥的跟前低声说：“别喊了，别喊了！敌人听见发现目标朝咱们打炮怎么办？”打援时，敌人打了两炮，他吓的脑袋向土里钻，屁股一撅，畏缩的不敢动了。他贪生怕死不能指挥掌握队伍，还无耻的说：“我宁叫打着屁股不让打着脑袋”。在战斗中他讲怪话：“受这个罪那如坐担架回去好！”战士批评他，他还说：“我早就这样落后，你才知道吗？”邱庆林富农成份，曾开过小差，被迫归队后，他说：“我当了七八年兵还是个兵，连个班长也当不了”。那时阶级路线不明确，不从出身与战场表现来考虑，单从资格上来看，又因缺人关系，把他提升成小炮班长。他的思想坏，不会管理队伍，全班不团结，时常发生问题，前次战斗中他表现的更坏，八十发炮弹他打了五十发。他打炮不测量距离，不看弹着点，更不组织战士打，把炮弹浪费了。晚上他扔下三个战士在前边担任警戒，自己胆小的跑到后边小窑睡了一夜。在战壕里战士王树二唱着玩，他不让唱，还辱骂战士，打击战士的情绪。
    战后在战评会上，战士们揭发了王二保、邱庆林贪生怕死的丑事，认为他们没有资格当班长，他们当班长，只会把队伍带坏了。领导上根据大家意见，当场宣布撤职。
