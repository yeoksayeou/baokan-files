　　To the Editor:
    I strongly agree with Comrade Fang's suggestion on the second page of your newspaper on January 5th. As a village cadre with limited literacy, I find it easier to understand when things are expressed in a simple way, so that I don't misunderstand the meaning. For example, on page two, in the statement "The Northeast Democratic Allied Army was renamed the People's Liberation Army," there is the phrase: "After Commander-in-Chief Lin suggested it to the Central Military Commission, and it was approved by the Central Military Commission..." Many of us questioned why our Democratic Allied Army had to be renamed the People's Liberation Army and needed the "Central Military Commission" to approve it. What right did they have to approve us!? Later, after other comrades explained that it was an abbreviation for the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and not the Kuomintang Central Military Commission, we realized the misunderstanding. We feel that announcements like these are not good.
    We particularly agree with the "Mass Blackboard" that has been published in the last two issues of your newspaper, which has solved many difficulties for rural areas and people with limited literacy.
    We hope that more similar writings will be published in the future.

　　不通俗容易错会了意思编缉（辑）同志：
    我很同意贵报一月五号二版方同志的健（建）议，因我是个识字少的村干部，觉着通俗点想看，甚至错会不了意思。如二版上：“东北民主联军改称人民解放军”内有：“经林总司令向中央军委健（建）议，并得中央军委批准………”一句话，我们好多人都怀疑，咱民主联军为什么改称人民解放军，还非请“中央军委”批准不可？他有啥资格批咱准！？后来经别的同志讲解，才知是中共中央的简称，不是国民党中央军委，你看这误会成啥了，向（象）这样的通告，我们感到不好。
    我们特别同意，最近两期贵报发表的“大众黑板”，这给农村与识字少的人解决了很多困难。
    希以后多发表类似这样字句。
