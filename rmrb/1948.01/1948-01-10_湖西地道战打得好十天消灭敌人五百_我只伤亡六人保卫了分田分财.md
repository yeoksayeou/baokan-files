[This dispatch from our newspaper in the Jilu Yu region on the 8th] The Lake West tunnel warfare victoriously protected the struggle of the masses in the border areas to distribute grain and wealth. On the 17th of last month, two regiments of the enemy's 88th Division from Dangshan, carrying four howitzers and eight mountain guns, attacked our tunnel area in northern Dangshan. More than 30 of our tunnel warriors fought bravely against the enemy for a whole day, repelling four fierce enemy attacks and killing or wounding 137 enemy soldiers, including a battalion commander. On the 18th, the Peitong County Working Team coordinated with the Balou area of Lizhai in distributing grain and wealth. More than 500 Chiang bandits from Tongshan County surrounded and attacked us. When the 500+ Chiang bandits entered our position, our Working Team unleashed a hail of machine gun fire, killing or wounding more than 20 Chiang bandits. After the Chiang bandits of Tongshan were defeated, they again attacked our Working Team with heavy troops. When the Chiang bandits were lured into our tunnel area, gunfire erupted everywhere, and the Chiang bandits fled in panic, with more than ten Chiang bandits being killed. On the 21st, more than 300 Chiang bandits, carrying several artillery pieces, set out from Huangfu Station and attacked our tunnel area in Huashan County. They began with a fierce artillery barrage. District Chief Yin led the Working Team into the tunnels to fight back. After several hours of fierce fighting, more than 20 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and the enemy abandoned three corpses and fled. From Yutai, part of the enemy's 70th Division, more than 1,500 men, on January 2nd, coordinated with a regiment from Fengxian County, along with four tanks and more than ten vehicles, to surround our Peixian County Working Team. More than 50 of our Working Team members immediately entered the tunnels to fight. After two days and nights of fighting, by the 23rd, a total of more than 200 enemy soldiers had been killed or wounded. On the 23rd at dawn, the Chiang bandits again, accompanied by two tanks and nine vehicles, a total of more than 1,500 men, attacked our tunnel area in western Feng County. After six hours of fierce fighting, more than 30 enemy soldiers, including a battalion commander, were killed or wounded. We only suffered three injuries. On the 26th at dawn, the enemy's 147th Brigade and the Provincial Security Regiment, a total of more than 3,000 men, again attacked our tunnel area in northern Dangshan. The Working Team, totaling more than 70, fought against the enemy and killed more than 70 enemy soldiers in one day. We only suffered three minor injuries. On the 28th at dawn, more than 1,500 enemies, in three directions, surrounded the ××× tunnel area in Fengxian County for battle. More than 30 enemy soldiers were killed in one day.
