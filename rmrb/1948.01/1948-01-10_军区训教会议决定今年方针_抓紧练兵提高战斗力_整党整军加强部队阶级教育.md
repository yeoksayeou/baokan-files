[Report from This Newspaper] The training and education conference held by the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region concluded on December 26th, having begun on December 15th of last year. After reports and discussions, in addition to the participation of the military and political leaders and responsible comrades of the training and education departments of various military regions, columns, and the military academy, Deputy Commanders Xu and Teng also personally participated and presided over the meeting. During the reports and discussions, on the one hand, ruthless exposure and deep self-criticism were made regarding the shortcomings of dogmatism and formalism in the training and education work of the troops. On the other hand, many valuable experiences were also introduced. For example, the 11th Column's experience in night attacks, village battles, and fighting tanks; their conduct of this practical combat education was mainly through battlefield summaries. At the same time, the excellent system of "assessing casualties," which uses combat to teach combat, was also widely established in the 11th Column. The Taihang 41st Regiment, from January to November 17th, 1947, in addition to marching and fighting, secured a total of 98 days for training. After training, their combat effectiveness was greatly improved. Another example is that during the first attack on Yuncheng by a certain column, while the front-line troops were fighting, the second-line troops were still using their time to train. This proves that seizing the gaps between battles for training is not only necessary but also possible. The conference concluded on December 26th. First, Deputy Commander Teng gave a concluding report, focusing on the following issues:

	(1) Regarding strengthening troop training, it is extremely important to seize the gaps between battles for training; we must utilize all available time for training at any time and any place. The idea that frequent battles make training impossible or that training is impossible during gaps between battles is wrong. Troop training must be the responsibility of the leaders, who must personally take action. Any commander who only knows how to fight but does not understand training or neglects training cannot be a good commander; his troops cannot become a victorious army. At the same time, this is also being irresponsible to the people or not fulfilling all responsibilities; it is treating the lives of the people's soldiers as child's play. Therefore, a good commander must regard training and combat as equally important tasks, and leaders at all levels must take responsibility for training.

	(2) The training and education guidelines for 1948 are: In the military aspect: strengthen the technical training of the troops, improve the command ability of cadres, and through training and combat, make our troops able to withstand the test of continuous operations. At the same time, in tactics, we must cultivate a tenacious spirit of attacking fortified positions and learn the skills of attacking fortified positions to adapt to the task of continuous fortified attacks to eliminate the remaining enemies in the inner lines. The specific requirements for military training are: senior cadres should strengthen tactical ideological education, improve theoretical levels, summarize combat experience, and combine theory with practice to improve command ability. Company and battalion cadres should strengthen their ability to organize combat, appropriately use light and heavy weapons, be good at commanding troops, and be proficient in technology. Troop education should focus on improving the ability to attack fortified positions and conduct continuous operations, so that the new corps can be trained into strong main force corps. In particular, it is necessary to improve the troops' skills in shooting, grenade throwing, bayonet fighting, field work, and demolition. Guerrilla units are required to be good at fighting small annihilation battles (annihilating an enemy squad or platoon) and clearly establish the idea of accumulating small victories into big ones. The main task of the militia is to learn flying demolition and fight sparrow warfare. In terms of political education: conduct universal Party and army rectification, start with "speaking bitterness," universally carry out class investigation and ideological investigation movements, and deeply conduct class education on land reform. This is basic education, and all other education must be conducted around class education. It is necessary to strengthen systematic current affairs education, deepen and enhance the confidence in the inevitable defeat of Chiang Kai-shek and our inevitable victory, overcome right-leaning sentiments, eliminate certain pro-American views, and shatter peace illusions from any quarter. Attention should be paid to strengthening the cultural education of the troops: Because 350,000 liberated peasants are enthusiastically joining our People's Liberation Army, it is of particular importance to strengthen the cultural education of the troops and carry out literacy campaigns to improve their cultural level. Therefore, we call on comrades from intellectual backgrounds to enthusiastically help workers and peasants learn culture.

	(3) Regarding the education of cadres on the job: It is stipulated that all agencies above the regimental level should resume the system of two hours of study per day. Party committee secretaries at all levels in the army must be responsible for leading and organizing cadre study; Party committees at all levels must act in accordance with the Party Constitution and regard leading study as one of their regular tasks. In addition, some required documents for cadres on the job are stipulated: Required reading for military and political cadres above the regimental level includes: "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War," "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," "The Outline Land Law of China," "Resolution of the Gutian Conference," Comrade Tan Zheng's report on army political work, "On Coalition Government," "On the Liberated Area Battlefield," "Combined Tactics," "Fear and Fearlessness," "Days and Nights," and "The People Are Immortal." Required reading for military and political cadres at the battalion and company levels includes: "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," "The Outline Land Law of China," "Principles of Tactics," and "Fear and Fearlessness." Guerrilla unit cadres can also read "Russian Sailors" and "Eyewitness Account." Medical cadres must also read the book "Surgeon." Other arms of service and departments should also read one or two professional books.

	(4) Regarding school education: Restore and improve all levels of rotational training teams, and leaders at all levels must strengthen the leadership of schools at all levels. It is now stipulated that the Military and Political University is a school for cultivating talents, cultivating company and battalion cadres for the troops. Rotational training teams at all levels below the military region basically provide rotational training for cadres on the job.

Finally, a very detailed and profound explanation was given regarding the "speak bitterness" movement, the mutual aid movement, the merit-making movement, and the mass line in the troops.

After Deputy Commander Teng's concluding report, Deputy Commander Xu delivered the closing remarks. Deputy Commander Xu repeatedly and emphatically instructed that commanders must be good at fighting and good at training troops, and military cadres must study theory and the mass line in the army. He also clearly put forward: Oppose the Golovlyov-like thinking of being complacent and not learning, and oppose the death tactics of not talking about tactics and not cherishing soldiers.

　　军区训教会议决定今年方针
  　抓紧练兵提高战斗力
    整党整军加强部队阶级教育
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫军区召开的训练教育会议，从去年十二月十五日开始到二十六日总结，经过汇报讨论，除有各军区各纵队及军大的军政首长和训练教育部门的负责同志参加外，徐、滕副司令员还亲自参加主持。在汇报讨论中，一方面对部队训练教育工作的教条主义、形式主义等缺点做了无情的揭发和深刻的检讨，一方面也介绍了许多宝贵的经验。例如：十一纵队的夜间攻击的经验，村落战的经验，打坦克的经验；他们对这些实战教育的进行，主要的是用战场总结的方式。同时，评定伤亡这个以战教战的优良制度，也在十一纵队普遍建立起来。太行四十一团，从一九四七年一月到十一月十七日止，部队除行军作战外，共争取九十八天时间，进行了训练。经过训练，他们的战斗力大大提高了。又如某纵队在第一次攻运城时，第一线的部队在作战，第二线的部队还在利用时间进行练兵。这都证明：抓紧战斗间隙进行练兵，不仅是需要的，而且是可能的。至十二月二十六日，大会进行总结。首由滕副司令员做总结报告，着重指出以下几个问题：
    （一）关于加强部队训练，要抓紧战斗间隙来训练，这是十分重要的问题；要随时随地利用一切可以利用的时间去训练。凡说战斗频繁无法练兵或者战斗间隙不能练兵的思想，都是错误的。部队训练必须首长负责，亲自动手。任何一个指挥员，如果只会打仗，不懂训练或放松训练，他就不能是一个好指挥员；他的部队也就不能成为常胜的军队。同时这也就是对人民不负责任或没有负到全部责任；也就是把人民子弟兵的性命当成儿戏。因此一个好指挥员必须把训练与作战看做同等重要的任务，各级首长必须把训练的责任担负起来。
    （二）一九四八年的训练教育方针；军事方面：加强部队技术训练，提高干部指挥能力，在训练与作战中，使我们部队经得起连续作战的考验。同时在战术上必须养成顽强的攻坚精神，学会攻坚的技能，以适应连续攻坚作战肃清内线残余敌人的任务。军事训练的具体要求是：高级干部在于加强战术思想教育，提高理论水平，总结战斗经验，从实战中来结合理论，以提高指挥能力。连、营干部加强其组织战斗能力，适当运用轻重火器及善于掌握部队，熟练技术。部队教育在于提高攻坚及连续作战能力，使新的兵团锻炼成为坚强的主力兵团。特别要提高部队射击、投弹、刺杀、土工作业、爆破等技术。对游击队，要求善于打小的歼灭战（歼敌一个班、一个排），明确树立积小胜为大胜的思想。民兵主要的要学会飞行爆破和打麻雀战。政治教育方面：进行普遍的整党整军，从诉苦入手，普遍开展查阶级、查思想运动，深入土地改革的阶级教育。这是基本教育，其他一切教育均须围绕阶级教育去进行。要强化系统的时事教育，加深和提高蒋必败我必胜的胜利信心，克服右倾情绪，肃清某些恐美的观点，粉碎来自任何方面的和平幻想。要注意加强部队文化教育：由于三十五万翻身农民热烈涌入我人民解放军，今后加强部队文化教育，开展识字运动，以提高他们的文化水平，是有特殊重要意义的。因此我们号召知识分子出身的同志，必须热诚帮助工农战士学文化。
    （三）关于在职干部教育：规定凡团以上机关，恢复每日两小时学习制度。军队中各级党委书记，须负责领导和组织干部学习；各级党委都要按照党章办事，把领导学习作为自己经常任务之一。此外规定了在职干部的一些必读文件，团以上军政干部之必读文件为：中国革命战争的战略问题、中国革命与中国共产党、中国土地法大纲、古田会议决议案、谭政同志关于军队政治工作的报告、论联合政府、论解放区战场、合同战术、恐惧与无畏、日日夜夜、人民是不朽的。营、连军政干部之必读文件为：中国革命与中国共产党、中国土地法大纲、战术概则、恐惧与无畏。游击部队干部可加读俄罗斯水兵和目击记。医务干部还必须读外科医生一书。其他各兵种各部门，还应读本行业务书籍一、二种。
    （四）关于学校教育：恢复与健全各级轮训队，各级首长须加强对各级学校的领导。今后规定军政大学为培养性质的学校，培养部队连、营干部。军区以下各级轮训队，基本上是轮训在职干部。
    最后，关于诉苦运动，互助运动，立功运动和部队中的群众路线问题，作了极详细深刻的说明。
    滕副司令员总结报告完毕之后，接着由徐副司令员致闭幕词。徐副司令员反复的着重的指示说明：指挥员必须善于作战和善于训练部队，军事干部一定要学理论和军队中的群众路线等问题。他并且明确提出：反对摆老资格不学习的戈尔洛夫思想，反对不讲战术，不爱兵的送死战术。
