　　Right-leaning sentiments swept away
    —— Three months of guerrilla warfare in Qi County
    ·Jiang Sen·
            The situation before September 4th
    Qi County, once the old nest of local bandits in northern Henan like Hu Quanlu and Yang Fu, was liberated by the People's Liberation Army's spring offensive. However, after the main force of the People's Liberation Army transferred, the remnant bandits re-occupied villages such as Da Lizhuang, Xigang, and Yumin as a base for continuing to rule the people of Qi County, achieving their ambition to restore the landlord regime. After a period of organization and preparation, the enemy restored its broken landlord-special agent ruling system, colluding openly and secretly, using superstition and deception, developing secret societies, and infiltrating our internal affairs. Starting with the Baotun incident on August 20th, they began to attack the democratic regime. The Shangcao incident on the 24th and robberies in Lihetun, Mazhuang, Guanzhuang, and the city occurred successively, affecting even Miaokou, which was a base area during the Anti-Japanese War, causing tension. Some cadres in various agencies fled in panic. The government of the Third District went into exile, and the First, Second, Fifth, and Sixth Districts fled to the mountains, some even going up the mountains. The leadership initially considered these to be isolated small matters, but the situation continued to develop, cadres were panicked, the masses were either neutral or panicked, and the leadership's thinking also became chaotic.
    Why did this situation occur? Was the enemy powerful? The answer is definitely no! It was because there were shortcomings in our leadership and work itself. The assessment and understanding of the current situation in northern Henan and the feudal bandit forces remaining in northern Henan were insufficient. The leadership's thinking, cadres' thinking, and the masses became paralyzed, waiting for the main force to counterattack. Work was resisted by these ideas, unified leadership was weak, forces were not concentrated, guerrilla warfare was relaxed, or even abandoned. When distributing land, no assistance was given to the poor and hired laborers to arm themselves, saying "the poor and hired laborers are too honest," or the poor and hired laborers were not mobilized, and the arms were handed over to the landlords and local bullies. Some people even created a theory saying: "It is impossible to launch land reform without taking Qimen." They lingered and turned in the circle of "three insurances," giving the landlord and bully regime a chance to revive.
    　　　　Clarify the policy and arm ourselves to open up the situation
    The leadership studied and reviewed the above situation, accepted the instructions of the prefectural committee on the policy of "the enemy advances, we advance; the enemy does not advance, we also advance" to develop guerrilla warfare, and the characteristics of land reform in the border area and the KMT-controlled area of "holding a gun in one hand and distributing land in the other," broke through all obstacles, unified the thinking of cadres, clarified the policy, concentrated the forces that could be concentrated, and began to counterattack the offensives launched by the Chiang bandits, local bullies and landlords.
    　　　　Yang bandit Wang Xianwen's detachment was annihilated
    On September 4th, six routes of the army marched into Da Lizhuang, Xigang, Yumin, Hekou, Da Checun, Shihe and other villages, hitting the bank of the Wei River. On the night of September 4th, the 49th unit annihilated the Yang Fu and Wang Xianwen detachment stationed in Da Lizhuang, while at the same time, the puppet bandits in Xigang, Yumin and other strongholds fled in panic. By the 5th, there was no trace of the enemy in the entire county.
    On the 6th, after repelling the counterattack by Gao Yongqing and other "secret society" troops of more than 300 people, local armed forces were organized in coordination with Hua County to carry out a pursuit operation. On the night of the 10th, an attack was launched on the three strongholds of Wei Xianji, Gongtang, and Juqiao in Hua County. The puppet bandits were defeated and fled. The Li Fang work team intercepted the fleeing enemies in Jinzhuang, killing and wounding five of them, and seizing one machine gun. In this period, a total of 61 bandits of Yang and Hu were annihilated, 60 local bullies and landlords were captured alive, one machine gun, 36 rifles, three grenade launchers, and many other military supplies were seized.
    　　　　Launch the capture, autumn distribution, and land distribution movement
    The 49th Unit and district cadres occupied Hekou, Doujie, Dachecun, and other places with sudden action, blocking the escape routes of scattered bandits and local bullies. Cadres, militiamen, work teams, and a powerful capture team organized by 600 farmers, an armed turn-over team, were distributed in eight mopping-up areas including Da Lizhuang, Xigang, and Yumin. Using methods such as large encirclements and class standing teams, they launched a sweeping movement of destroying bandit nests, digging out bandit eggs, and moving stones, and more than a thousand local bullies and landlords were caught within seven days. Within nine days, the masses in forty-four administrative villages distributed more than 2,700 dan of landlord grain, 8,900 mu of land, 250 head of livestock, and more than 45,000 pieces of agricultural implements.
    　　　playerCards Battle of Chengguan
    The sweeping autumn distribution and land distribution movement has already been booming, but the argument that "struggle cannot be carried out without taking Qimen" still exists in the minds of some comrades, who doubt this movement. Some comrades even said: "Confiscation and distribution are like burning straw, it will be over soon." Some said: "There are no activists, the poor and hired laborers are too honest, and dare not take the lead..." and so on, shouting in the autumn distribution and land distribution movement. The leadership strictly proposed an examination of this kind of resistance movement's argument, tracing the root cause to: "Saying in the meeting to support the masses and be their master, but staying during the day and leaving at night. The active elements were discovered in Yumin Chengguan on the first day, and they disappeared the next day. They felt that we were not their backers, coupled with the rumors of special agents and bad guys." The real reason was all found, that is, some cadres did not stick to the position with the masses, but fled to the right. At this point, the cadres from top to bottom resolved this problem, and resolved to stick to the position with the masses. Enemy bandits attacked our mopping-up and land distribution movement from the outside. On September 20th, they organized more than 200 people to attack Chengguan. More than 40 militiamen stationed in Chengguan resolutely resisted on the spot, and after smashing three enemy offensives, they cooperated with the militia support team led by District Chief Yan to drive away the enemy and protect the land distribution movement.
    　　　　Right-leaning sentiments swept away
    The masses in Xigang, Huangdui, Jiangzhuang and other villages, who did not dare to approach us at all in the past, now treat us like relatives when they see us, inviting us to their homes for meals and telling us about the affairs of the village. In Shizhuang, Liangxiang and other villages, when enemy situation was discovered, the masses retreated. When the masses in Huangdui discovered the enemy situation, they sent three reports to the district office thirteen li away within half a day. Three farmers in Jiangzhuang volunteered to go to Wei Xianji, where no one dared to go, to scout the enemy's situation. When our army crossed the Wei River to attack the bandit nests, the masses in Dongqiao and Shifosi, after hearing this, automatically took out tables and door panels to build bridges. The masses took off their clothes and went into the icy water as bridge legs to let their army pass.
    Right-leaning sentiments have been washed away by the waves of the mass movement.

　　右倾情绪扫光了
    ——淇县三个月的游击战争
    ·姜森·
            九月四号以前的情况
    曾经是豫北惯匪扈全禄、杨富等老巢的淇县，被人民解放军春季攻势解放了。但是人民解放军主力转移后，该匪残部复又攻占大李庄、西岗、迂民等村，作为继续统治淇县人民的根据地，达到其恢复地主政权的野心。敌人经过一段组织准备，恢复其已被打碎了的地主特务统治连系，明的暗的串通起来，利用迷信和欺骗，发展会门，打入我内部。自八月二十日鲍屯事件起，开始向民主政权进攻了，接连着二十四日上曹事件及李河屯、马庄、关庄以及城里的抢案等事件发生，以致影响到抗日时期即为根据地的庙口都紧张起来。各机关干部有的慌乱逃跑，三区政府流亡，一、二、五、六区跑到山边，有的还上了山。领导上开始认为是些个别的小事，但情势继续发展着，干部恐慌，群众或中立或恐慌，领导思想亦混乱起来了。
    为什么造成这样的局面呢？是敌人厉害吗？应该肯定的说不是！而是我们领导和工作本身有了缺点，对目前豫北的形势及残存在豫北的封建土匪武装估计认识不足，领导思想、干部思想以及群众麻痹起来了，等待着主力的反攻，工作受了这些思想的抵抗，统一领导无力，力量不集中，放松了游击战争，甚或放弃游击战争。分田不帮助雇贫武装起来，说什么“雇贫太老实”，或者不发动雇贫，把武装交到地主奸霸手里，有的人并制造出一种理论说：“不打下淇门，发动分田是不可能的。”而在“三保险”的圈子里徘徊兜转，给奸霸地主政权以死灰复燃的机会。
    　　　　明确方针武装打开局面
    领导上研究检讨了上述情况，接受了地委关于“敌进我进、敌不进我亦进”的开展游击战争方针，和边地、蒋管区“一手持枪、一手分田”土地改革特点的指示，冲破一切阻碍，统一干部思想，明确方针，集中了所能集中的力量，对蒋匪奸霸地主所发动的攻势开始反攻。
    　　　　杨匪王显文中队被歼灭
    九月四日，六路大军进发大李庄、西岗、迂民、河口、大车村、石河等村，打到卫河边岸。九月四日夜，四九部队把驻守大李庄的杨富、王显文中队歼灭，而同时西岗、迂民等据点伪匪闻风逃窜。至五日全县没有敌人踪影。
    六日，击退了“会队”高永清等部三百余人的反扑后，配合滑县地方武装组织了追击作战，于十日夜间出击滑县之魏贤集、公堂、聚桥等三据点，伪匪受创溃逃。李芳武工队于靳庄截击逃敌，毙伤其五名，缴机枪一挺，此段前后共计歼灭“会队”杨、扈匪六十一名，活捉奸霸地主六十名，缴获机枪一挺，步枪三十六支，掷弹筒三个，及其他军用品很多。
    　　　　展开捕捉分秋分田运动
    四九部队及区干部以突然动作，占领了河口、豆街、大车村等，堵住散匪奸霸的逃路，干部民兵武工队及六百农民组织的强大捕捉队，武装翻身队，分布在大李庄、西岗、迂民等八个清剿地区内，用大包围、划阶级站队等方法展开了捣匪巢，掏匪蛋、搬石头的一扫光运动，七天之内有千余奸霸地主落网。四十四个行政村九天之内，群众分得地主粮食两千七百余石，土地八千九百亩，牲口二百五十头，农具四万五千多件。
    　　　　城关战斗
    一扫光分秋分田运动已经轰开了，但是“不打下淇门斗争不能搞”的论调，仍在某些同志头脑里存在着，怀疑这一运动。有些同志甚至这样说：“没收分配是把茅草火、过去就完了。”有的说：“没有积极分子，雇贫太老实，不敢带头………”等，在分秋分田运动里喊叫。领导上对这种抵抗运动的论调，严格的提出检查，追出根源是：“开会说给群众撑腰作主，但白天在、夜里走。迂民城关头天发现积极分子，第二天跑的不见了，他们感到我们不是靠山，再加上特务坏蛋的造谣。”真实原因全部找到了，这就是有些干部没有和群众一块坚持阵地，右倾逃跑。至此干部自上而下解决了这一问题，决心和群众一起坚持阵地。敌匪对我清剿分田运动，从外部打进来，九月二十日组织二百余人进攻城关，我驻在城关的四十多个民兵，就地坚决抵抗，粉碎敌人三次冲锋后，配合阎区长率领之支援民兵队，把敌人打跑了，保卫了分田运动。
    　　　　右倾情绪扫光了
    从前根本不敢接近我们的西岗、黄堆、姜庄等村群众，现在见了我们就象亲人一样，招呼叫到自己家里吃饭，告说村里的事情。史庄、良相等村，发现敌情，群众就退却了，黄堆群众发现敌情，半天内向十三里外的区公所送三次情报，姜庄三个农民自报奋勇到无人敢去的魏贤集侦察敌人情况。我军过卫河出击匪巢，东桥、石佛寺群众听说自动把桌子、门板拿出搭桥，群众脱下衣服下到冰冷的水里当桥腿，让自己的军队过去。
    右倾的情绪，被群众运动的浪头冲洗了。
