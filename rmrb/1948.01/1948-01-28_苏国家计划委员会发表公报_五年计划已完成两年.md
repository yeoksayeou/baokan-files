Compared to the same quarter in 1946, the first quarter increased by only 5%, the second quarter by 18%, the third quarter by 26%, and the fourth quarter reached 30%.

The total urban retail sales reached 22.4 billion rubles, of which the retail volume in the fourth quarter doubled compared to the first quarter. The rationing system for food and consumer goods and the dual-price system for commerce implemented during the war have been abolished, and a unified price system has been implemented nationwide.
