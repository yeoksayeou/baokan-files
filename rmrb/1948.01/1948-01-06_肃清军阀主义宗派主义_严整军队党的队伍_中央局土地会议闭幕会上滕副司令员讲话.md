Comrades! The conference has been going on for two or three months, and it has been very successful. Comrade Yi Bo's summary report clearly indicated our direction, tasks, and methods to complete the tasks. Comrade Xu Xiangqian also spoke very clearly to us about the tasks at the current stage. The central government's policy is clear, and after such a long period of study, research, reflection, and self-criticism, everyone should be clear about it. The current problem is how to resolutely and thoroughly implement it after you go back. Comrade Yi Bo put it well, this is a historical task, the most central task for the whole party at present. If we do it well, we can overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and win the victory of the revolution. The peasants' liberation will also be completely victorious. If we don't do it well, the party and the country will perish, and we will lose our heads. I hope comrades will work hard after returning, and encourage each other with Comrade Yi Bo's report and Comrade Xu Xiangqian's speech. Comrade Yi Bo said everything about the whole issue in the summary. All our party comrades should act according to the summary. This summary is the method that everyone has researched. Here, I will say a few words about the army.

First of all, what I want to say is that the army should, without exception, resolutely and thoroughly implement the task of completely and equally distributing land and rectifying the party. According to the review of this conference, our army has two very wrong ideas: the first is to separate fighting from land reform; thinking that the army is in charge of fighting, and land reform is the business of party affairs workers and mass workers. Therefore, in the entire land reform, the army did not take on the responsibilities it should have. The vast majority adopted an attitude of standing by and being indifferent, and very few directly participated in helping. There were even many people who opposed land reform and did many anti-people and counter-revolutionary things. This is the most obvious manifestation of the army not serving the people. From now on, the army must actively participate in helping, supporting, and defending the peasant emancipation movement, and is not allowed to adopt an attitude of standing by. First of all, we must be clear in our minds that we are the sons and daughters of workers and peasants, and the peasant revolutionary army. Fighting Lao Jiang in the front and fighting the landlord class in the rear is one task, and both are fighting for the emancipation of the peasants. If we encounter landlords resisting the peasants or sabotaging the peasants' actions, the army should, without shirking its responsibility, suppress them. If we ignore them or turn a blind eye, it is an act of betraying the people and surrendering to the landlords. If we turn around and interfere with the peasant emancipation movement to support the landlords, it is a heinous counter-revolutionary act and must be severely punished by discipline. The second wrong idea is that the party in the army is thought to be purer than the local party, so the issue of party rectification in the army is not taken very seriously. This idea was relatively common in the period before the conference, and it cannot be said that it has completely disappeared now. In fact, the impurity of the party in the army is more serious than the local party in some places. Everyone has reviewed a lot, so I won't say it here. However, there is no doubt that the harm to the people from the impurity of the party in the army will be much more serious, because the army has weapons in its hands. If it serves the landlords, it will not only tip them off, secretly instigate them, and undermine the peasants' solidarity and struggle, but it will also armed suppress the peasants, creating a very serious situation. In Jinnan, a staff officer who had been a company commander hid many landlords and guns at home in preparation for an uprising. If he was still a company commander and led a company to revolt, you can see how serious the situation would be! Therefore, even if the impurity of the army is not more serious than the local party, its serious harm cannot be equated with the local party. We must be extremely vigilant. This is not a small matter, especially for comrades who work in the army, we must clearly recognize this point, otherwise we will make serious mistakes. Anyone who ignores this point and relaxes the party rectification in the army, and therefore makes serious mistakes, will be severely punished by party discipline.

So, how should the party in the army be rectified? The political department has convened responsible comrades from various military regions several times to exchange opinions. I have already mentioned some opinions in my last report. The Central Bureau will also issue special instructions. Here, I will only focus on two points:

First, we must rectify warlordism. The main difference and the most basic difference between the warlord army and the people's army is: on the one hand, it defends the interests of the landlord and bourgeoisie, and oppresses, exploits, and enslaves the people for the landlord and bourgeoisie; on the other hand, it defends the interests of the people and serves the people. However, whether it is a warlord army or a people's army, its vast majority of soldiers come from workers and peasants, and they organize, arm, and train the people. In order for the warlord army to make soldiers who originally came from the people oppress, exploit, and enslave the people for the landlord and bourgeoisie, it has to separate the soldiers from the people, make them forget their origins, detach themselves from the people everywhere, and oppose the people. This forms a set of warlord system, using all kinds of deceptive methods to specially educate and train soldiers, turning them into tools for warlords to get promoted and make a fortune, blindly serving the landlord and bourgeoisie, and doing evil on the heads of the people. The people's army must always make them know that they are the sons and daughters of the people, and should always unite with the people and be loyal and filial to the people. According to this standard, let's examine our army. How many truly conform to the essence of the people's army and are fully worthy of being called the people's army? From this conference, we can also see how our army is detached from the masses, how it bullies the people, oppresses the people, and has done many anti-people things. These are the manifestations of warlordism. Since the Anti-Japanese War, because North China was opened up after the Eighth Route Army came, and various political powers and mass organizations were established, some comrades in the army developed a wrong idea, thinking that the world was won by the army, and the people were liberated by the army. They just forgot that the army was originally organized by the people, and the people organized this army for their own liberation. Therefore, they believed that the army had merit and should be superior to others, doing whatever they wanted on the heads of the masses, demanding that the masses reward them for their merits and support them everywhere. As a result, all kinds of anti-people things such as beating and scolding the masses, coercing the masses, and harming the interests of the masses occurred. The attitude of some troops towards the people is even exactly the same as that of the warlord army. This is forgetting one's roots, this is disloyal and unfilial to the people, this is turning from the sons and daughters of the people into traitors and rebels of the people. Traitors and rebels, everyone has the right to punish them. From now on, everyone should stand up to interfere and oppose any anti-people things in the army. Whoever uses arms against the people is like turning the guns around on the front line to shoot at their own troops, and must be treated as a counter-revolutionary crime. If cadres lead soldiers to do anti-people things, the soldiers should not only not accept this counter-revolutionary order, but should also arrest these cadres and hand them over to the people's court. As long as the soldiers' awareness is raised, those anti-people orders that do evil will definitely not be able to be implemented, and will definitely be severely打击.

Second, we must rectify sectarianism in the army. The main manifestation is that the army makes independence from the people and the party, and becomes a hornet's nest that no one can provoke. Whenever problems occur between the army and the people, the army always speaks from the army's side without considering any conditions, as if it were an army gang opposed to the people. This sectarianism is inseparable from warlordism. The main ideological source is the wrong idea that the army has merit and should stand on the heads of the people. Some cadres are even exactly the same as warlords, regarding the army as their own private property, and no one else can provoke them. This is particularly evident in land reform; whenever a military family member is struggled against, the army always demands care without any class stand or principles, or directly shields and covers up. This sectarianism is extremely blind, so it is taken advantage of by landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements. Obviously they are targets of the people's enemy struggle, and once they get into the army, the army treats them as their own and shields and covers them up. These people are clearly using the army to oppress the people, and our army blindly supports them, thinking that they are taking care of cadres and soldiers. For example, the beating of district and village cadres by the Tangyin Brigade and the Sixth Column's return-to-unit battalion was caused by the instigation of one or two bad elements. This sectarianism that makes independence from the people, whether it is blind or not, is essentially anti-people. As a result, the army will become a large anti-people group. Our army is the people's army, and should serve the people wholeheartedly and well. It is not allowed to make independence from the people and become a faction of its own. All views and handling of problems must be based on the interests and opinions of the people. The people are the army's biological parents and adoptive parents. Even if there is merit, it should be attributed to the people. From now on, when problems occur between the army and the people, we must never simply treat it as a relationship between the army and the people. We must also use the class stand, viewpoint, and method to analyze it and see whether it is anti-people or an internal dispute; even if it is an internal dispute, we must clearly point out that this is a manifestation of the army not serving the people well and not fulfilling its responsibility as a loyal and filial son of the people, and should also be criticized and blamed.

In short, serving the people is the essence of the people's army. Without this, it cannot be said to be the people's army. From now on, we must use this standard to check. Moreover, serving the people is not abstract, it should be concrete. It is not only reflected in combat and land reform, but also in all aspects of life and action. The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention are a concrete standard, which can be used for us to check our own troops, how much they have served the people, and whether they are worthy of being called the people's army. If they are not worthy of being called the people's army, the comrades who lead the troops at all levels must reflect on what they have done for the people? Have they eaten millet rice for nothing and not taken responsibility for the people? Is there a problem with their own position? There can be no ambiguity about this.

Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu put forward the three major principles of army building in the report on the coalition government and the report on the liberated areas battlefield in the Seventh National Congress, that is, the three major guidelines for army building. We must use this to check, rectify, and eliminate the serious and widespread sectarianism and warlordism that make independence from the party and the people in the People's Liberation Army.

The conference has been going on for a long time and there has been a lot of discussion. I fully agree with Comrade Yi Bo's summary. I believe that our region will make a big step forward. The whole party rectifies the party and the army at the same time in the land reform. This is another big test for us in the twenty-six years of army building. History will continue to test us, and we should be able to withstand the test.

　　肃清军阀主义宗派主义
  　严整军队党的队伍
    中央局土地会议闭幕会上滕副司令员讲话
    同志们！大会开了两三个月，很成功。一波同志的总结报告指示我们的方针、任务，及完成任务的办法，都很明确，很清楚。徐向前同志向我们谈的对现阶段的任务，也讲得很清楚了。中央的方针是明确的，经过了这样长时间的学习、研究、反省、检讨，大家也应该是明确的了。现在的问题，是大家回去后，如何坚决彻底执行的问题。一波同志说的好，这是一个历史的任务，是全党目前一个最中心的任务，作得好就可以打倒蒋介石，取得革命的胜利，农民的翻身也会彻底得到胜利，作不好就要亡党亡国亡头。希望同志们回去好好的工作，以一波同志的报告，徐向前同志的讲话，共同勉励。整个问题，一波同志在总结中都说了，我们全党的同志，就照总结办事，这个总结是大家研究出来的办法。这里我就军队方面说几句话。
    首先，我要说的，就是军队在这次彻底平分土地与整党的任务中，应该毫无例外地同样坚决彻底执行，根据这次大会的检讨，我们军队有两个非常错误的思想：第一个就是把打仗与土地改革分开；认为军队是管打仗的，土地改革是党务工作群众工作者的事情，所以在整个土地改革中军队未担负起应负的任务，绝大多数是采取袖手旁观，漠不关心的态度，直接参加帮助的很少，甚至还有不少的人反对土地改革，作了许多反人民反革命的事情，这是军队没有为人民服务最明显的表现。今后军队一律要积极参加帮助、拥护、保卫农民翻身运动，不准采取袖手旁观的态度。首先在思想上要明确自己是工农的子弟，是农民革命军，在前方打老蒋与在后方打地主阶级是一个任务，都是为农民翻身而战。如果遇到地主反抗农民，破坏农民的行动，军队应该责无旁贷加以镇压，如果置之不理或熟视无睹，就是背叛人民投降地主的行动；如果还要反过来干涉农民的翻身运动为地主撑腰，那就是罪大恶极的反革命行为，一定要受到严厉的纪律制裁。第二个错误的思想，就是以为军队的党要比地方的党纯洁，因而对军队整党的问题看得不十分严重。这种思想在大会前一个时期是比较普遍的，现在还不能说是就完全没有了。事实上，军队党的不纯，在某些地方是比地方党还严重的，大家都检讨出来了很多，这里不再说。但军队党的不纯，其对人民的危害将更严重得多，这是毫无问题的，因为军队手里拿有武器，他如果给地主服务，就不仅是通风报信，暗中挑拨，破坏农民的团结斗争等等而已，并且会武装镇压农民，造成非常严重的形势；冀南有一个当过连长的参谋，曾在家里隐藏许多地主和枪支准备暴动，要是他还在当连长带着一连人暴动起来，你们看应该是多么严重的情况！所以即使军队的不纯，并不比地方党还严重，但他的危害之严重是不能与地方等量齐观的，我们一定要万分的警惕。这不是什么小题大做，特别是作军队工作的同志，要明确认识这一点，不然是要犯严重错误的。谁要是忽视了这点，放松了军队的整党，因而犯了严重的错误，一定要受到党的纪律的制裁。
    那么，军队党到底应该怎样整呢？政治部已经召集各军区负责同志交换了几次意见，我在上次报告中已经大概提了几点意见，中央局还要专门发出指示，这里我只着重讲两点：
    第一、是要整军阀主义。军阀军队与人民军队主要的区别也是最基本的区别，就是：一方面是保卫地主资产阶级的利益，为地主资产阶级压迫人民、剥削人民、奴役人民的；另一方面是保卫人民的利益，为人民服务的。但是不管是军阀军队或人民军队，他的广大士兵都是来自工农，都是把人民组织、武装、训练起来的。军阀军队为了要使本来出身于人民的兵士去为地主资产阶级压迫、剥削、奴役人民，他就不能不把兵士与人民分开，要他忘记自己的出身，处处脱离人民，反对人民，这就形成了一套军阀制度，用尽一切欺骗蒙蔽的方法，专门教育训练士兵，变成军阀私人升官发财的工具，盲目去为地主资产阶级服务，站在人民头上为非作恶。人民的军队是始终要使他知道自己是人民的子弟，应该永远与人民结合，为人民尽忠尽孝的。根据这个标准来检查我们的军队，大家看看，到底有多少真正合乎人民军队的本质，完全配称为人民的军队？从这次大会中，我们也可以看出我们军队是怎样脱离群众，是怎样欺负人民，压迫人民，曾经作了多少反人民的事情，这些，就是军阀主义的表现。抗战以来，由于华北是在八路军来后才打开局面，建立了各种政权、民众的组织，部队有些同志就发生一种错误的思想，以为天下是军队打下来的，人民是军队解放出来的，恰恰忘记了军队本来是人民组织起来的，人民正是为了自己的解放才组织起这支军队的，因此认为军队有功，应该高人一等，站在群众的头上为所欲为，要求群众向自己报功，处处拥护自己，于是打骂群众，强迫群众，损害群众利益的各种反人民的事情都发生了。有些部队对待人民的态度，甚至和军阀军队完全一样，这就是忘本，这就是对人民不忠不孝，这就是由人民的子弟变成人民的乱臣贼子。乱臣贼子，人人得而诛之。今后军队凡是有反人民的事情，大家都要起来干涉、反对；谁要拿武装去对着人民，这就犹如在火线上倒转枪口向自己的部队打是一样的，一定要当作反革命治罪。要是干部带着战士去作反人民的事情，战士不但不应接受这种反革命的命令，而且应将这种干部逮捕起来，送交人民法庭。只要战士觉悟提高了，那些为非作恶的反人民的命令就一定执行不通的，而且一定要受到严重的打击的。
    第二，是要整军队的宗派主义。主要的表现是军队向人民向党闹独立性，成了惹不得的一窝蜂，凡是军队与人民发生了问题，军队总是不加考虑的毫无条件的站在军队方面讲话，俨然是一个与人民对立的军队帮。这种宗派主义是和军阀主义分不开的，主要的思想根源也就是认为军队有功，应该站在人民头上的错误思想作怪。有些干部还与军阀完全一样，把军队看成自己私人的，别人就惹不得。这在土改中表现得特别明显；凡是军属被斗了，军队总是毫无阶级立场毫无原则性的要求照顾，或直接袒护包庇，这种宗派主义是带着极大的盲目性的，因此被地主富农反革命分子乘隙利用，明明是人民敌对的斗争对象，一钻到部队，部队就把他当做自己人看待而袒护包庇起来，这批人明明是利用军队去欺压人民，我们军队就盲目地去支持他，还以为照顾干部和战士。例如汤阴大队和六纵队的归队营之打区村干部，都是由一两个坏分子挑拨煽动而发生的。这种与人民闹独立性的宗派主义，不管是盲目的与非盲目的，实质上都是反人民的，结果军队就会成为反人民的大集团。我们的军队是人民的军队，应该全心全意，好好为人民服务，不准向人民闹独立性而自成一派。一切问题的看法和处理，都要根据人民的利益和意见，人民是军队的生身父母和养身父母，即使有功也要归于人民。今后军队与人民发生了问题，我们绝不能简单地当作一种军民关系去看，也是要用阶级的立场观点方法去加以分析，看到底是反人民的，还是内部的纠纷问题；即使是内部的纠纷，也要明确的指出，这是军队没有很好为人民服务的表现，没有尽到作人民的忠臣孝子的责任，也应该受到批评和责备。
    总而言之，为人民服务，是人民军队的本质，没有这一点就不能说是人民的军队，我们以后就要根据这个标准来检查。而且为人民服务不是抽象的，应该是具体的，不只是表现在作战和土地改革中，而且也表现在一切生活行动中。三大纪律、八项注意，就是一个具体的标准，这可以供我们来检查自己的部队，到底为人民服务了几分，是否配称为人民的军队，如果不配称为人民的军队，我们各级带兵的同志，就要反省自己为人民作了些什么事情？是否白吃了小米饭不给人民负责任？是否是自己的立场都有了问题？这是一点也不能含糊的。
    毛主席、朱总司令在七大报告的论联合政府和论解放区战场中提出建军的三大原则，即建军的三大方针，我们要以此来检查、整顿，来肃清人民解放军中严重的普遍的向党向人民闹独立性的宗派主义与军阀主义思想。
    大会开的很久，讨论得很多，我完全同意一波同志的总结，我相信我区要大大前进一步。全党在土地改革中同时整党整军，这就是建军二十六年来对我们的又一大考验。历史还要继续的考验我们，我们是应该经得起考验的。
