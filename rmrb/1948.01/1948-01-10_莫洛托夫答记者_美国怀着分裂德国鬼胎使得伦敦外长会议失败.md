    The U.S. Cherishes the Ghost of a Divided Germany, Causing the Failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Moscow Dispatch: In late last year, Molotov, in response to reporters from "Pravda" and "Izvestia" regarding the failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, stated that the "imperialist bloc of the United States, Britain, and France" attempted to "cancel the Potsdam and Yalta agreements, which are consistent with the interests of peace and security in Europe," and that "U.S. imperialism used Western Germany as a base for adventurous aggression," "leading to the failure of the London Conference." He continued, "There were two fundamental issues on which the conference failed to reach an agreement": (1) The issue of a peace treaty with Germany: The Soviet Union believes that "this is a significant issue not only for Germany but also for all European countries striving to establish a solid peace." Therefore, "the Soviet delegation insisted that the preparation work for a peace treaty with Germany could no longer be delayed for a moment and should begin immediately." However, "the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France did not consider the conclusion of peace with Germany as the main issue of the London Conference, and even tried to completely remove it from the agenda. When this was impossible, they delayed it and entangled it with other minor issues." (2) The issue of rebuilding a unified Germany: "The Soviet delegation firmly advocated the immediate establishment of a provisional central government for a democratic Germany. After being opposed by the United States, Britain, and France, it suggested taking the first step of establishing central administrative departments for the German economy, because this is not only related to the national life of the German people but also to the democratization and elimination of militarism throughout the territory of Germany, and will guarantee Germany's fulfillment of its obligations to the Allied countries." "However, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France reduced the task of unification to merely the occupying authorities concluding certain agreements to eliminate tariff barriers for the circulation of goods. Their purpose was only to facilitate the dumping of goods in Germany by their countries' export companies." Molotov further exposed the activities of the United States, Britain, and France in undermining the reconstruction and unification of Germany, stating: "Recently, American and British newspapers have reported news about the preparation of a separate German government in the occupied areas, a constitution has already been drafted, and new currencies are being issued." "Now everyone knows that the United States wants to turn Western Germany into a base for expansion into Europe." "The Marshall Plan provides Western Germany with billions of dollars in loans over four years, so that German and American monopoly capitalists can become more reconciled, jointly exploit the German people, and make it more difficult for German small and medium-sized industrialists." Molotov pointed out that, according to this U.S. plan, the interests of the countries that had been invaded by Germany were naturally disregarded, and opposition was raised to Germany fulfilling its reparations obligations. Obviously, the longer the United States delays the formation of a unified German government, the more time those implementing the U.S. plan have to "do as they please." Finally, Molotov strongly stated: "The responsibility for the failure of the London Conference should be borne by the U.S. ruling class, and Bevin and Bidault also echoed Marshall."

    美国怀着分裂德国鬼胎使得伦敦外长会议失败
    【新华社陕北六日电】莫斯科讯：莫洛托夫于去年底答复“真理报”与“消息报”记者关于伦敦外长会议失败之经过称：由于美英法帝国主义集团企图“取消与欧洲和平安全利益一致的波茨顿、雅尔塔协定”，及“美帝国主义利用西部德国作为冒险侵略基地”，“致使伦敦会议归于失败”。继称：“会议没有达成协议的有两个基本问题”：（一）对德和约问题：苏联认为：“这不只对于德国而且对于一切努力于建立巩固和平的欧洲国家都是一个重大的问题”。因此，“苏联代表团坚持对德和约准备工作不能再有片刻稽延，而且应当立即开始”。然而，“美英法三国代表则不认为对德媾和是伦敦会议的主要问题，甚至力图从议程上完全取消，不可能时即拖延它，把它和其它次要问题纠缠在一起”。（二）重建德国统一问题：“苏联代表团坚决主张立即建立民主德国的临时中央政府，经美英法横加反对后，又建议第一步先设立德国经济中央行政管理部门，因为这不仅关系德国人民的国家生活，而且关系于德国民主化及废除军国主义之在全境实现，并将保证德国对盟国义务之履行”。“然而，美英法代表却把统一的任务，缩小到仅是各占领当局，订立某些为流通货物而取消关税壁垒的协定。其目的只是为了他们底国家的出口公司，便于在德倾销货物”。接着莫氏更进一步揭露美英法破坏德国重建统一的活动称：“最近美英报纸都报导要以占领区准备单独成立德国政府的消息，宪法已经草成了，新货币都在发行”，“现在谁都知道美国想把西部德国造成向欧洲扩张的基地”。“马歇尔计划四年中给西部德国数十亿美元贷款，以使德美两国独占资本家更加和解，共同压榨德国人民及使德国中小工业家陷入更困难的境地”。莫氏指出：根据美国此种计划，自然就丝毫不顾及曾受德国侵略的各国利益，而反对德国履行赔偿义务。显然的，美国拖延组成德国统一政府的时期愈长，则愈使那些执行美国计划的人有更多时间“为所欲为”。最后，莫氏力称：“伦敦会议失败的责任是要由美国统治阶级来担负的，而贝文与比道尔也附和了马歇尔”。
