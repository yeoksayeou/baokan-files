　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th. Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC, went to Mizhi, Suide and other counties at the end of last month to inspect work in order to guide and promote land reform in the border area. On the 2nd of this month, at a conference of cadres of the Suide Party, Government and Military Land Reform Work Group, he gave important instructions on how to divide classes and deal with disaster relief in the land reform, saying: "In land reform, only by correctly analyzing the classes can we correctly implement the Land Law Outline. Attention should be paid to correcting the 'leftist' tendency of classifying middle peasants as rich peasants when dividing classes. When strictly dividing class boundaries, the basis should be whether or not means of production (mainly land in rural areas) are occupied, how much is occupied, and the relationship of exploitation, and tendencies should be discovered and corrected at any time." Regarding disaster relief work, Comrade Zhongxun instructed: "We must closely integrate disaster relief with land reform. In areas with severe disasters, land reform can be suspended and all efforts can be devoted to disaster relief."

　　指导推选土地改革
  　习仲勋同志下乡
    【新华社西北十三日电】中共西北局书记习仲勋同志为指导与推进边区土地改革，于上月底到米脂、绥德等县检查工作。本月二日他在绥德党政军土地改革工作团干部会议上，对于在土地改革中如何划分阶级与救灾问题应着重指示说：“在土地改革工作中只有正确分析阶级才能正确执行土地法大纲。应注意纠正在划分阶级时把中农订成富农的过‘左’倾向。严格划分阶级界限时，应以生产手段（在农村中主要是土地）占有与否、占有多少、及剥削关系为根据，并随时发现倾向，随时纠正。”关于救灾工作，仲勋同志指示说：“我们必须把救灾和土地改革密切结合，灾情严重的地区，可停止土地改革，全力进行救灾。”
