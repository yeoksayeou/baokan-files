Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 1st - The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters has issued its 17th War Communiqué stating: The Northeast battlefield our army braving the extraordinary cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius, launched a powerful winter offensive from December 15th. In the past two weeks (December 15th to 28th), we captured seven cities including Changtu, Kaiyuan, Beizhen, Yutian, Haicheng, Liaozhong, and Zhangwu. We completely annihilated the Chiang bandit 49th Army's 79th Division, one regiment of the 207th Division, one regiment of the Provisional 59th Division, and the Third Column of the Transportation Police. We also completely routed the bandit New 6th Army's New 22nd Division and the 10th Cavalry Division, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 23,000 bandits in total. The main combat details and results are announced as follows: (1) North of Shenyang: Our army recaptured Changtu and Kaiyuan on the 15th and annihilated the bandit Provisional 62nd Division's (Note: A newly formed division belonging to the New 6th Army) 3rd Regiment mortar company at Diaobingshan, 30 miles southeast of Faku, on the same day. A part of our army then besieged Faku. The enemy New 6th Army's entire New 22nd Division and one regiment of the 14th Division rushed to Faku from Tieling to reinforce, but were completely routed by our forces in the Diaobingshan and Shahousuo area (both southeast of Faku) on the 17th, with nearly a thousand annihilated and captured. The remaining enemies abandoned a large number of corpses, wounded soldiers, and ammunition and fled in panic. On the same day, another part of our army completely annihilated the bandit Provisional 59th Division's 2nd Regiment at Dagujiazi, 50 miles south of Faku, killing and capturing over 1,500, including the regimental commander (Note: This bandit now belongs to the New 3rd Army and is formed from local troops). The division's transportation battalion and engineer battalion were also completely wiped out near Shifosi, north of Shenyang, with more than 800 annihilated and captured. On the 23rd, the entire bandit 53rd Army fled from Xin Kaiyuan to Tieling. A part of our army pursued and attacked its rear, capturing more than 600. On the 26th, a part of our cavalry completely routed the enemy 10th Cavalry Division northeast of Xinmin in the Liao River, wounding and capturing more than 300. (2) West and Southwest of Shenyang: Our army destroyed more than 60 miles of the Beining Railway in the Jin (Zhou) Yi (County) section, the Jinzhou to Dalinghe section, and the Yixian to Beipiao section of the Jin-Cheng Railway in the first two days of the offensive. We then marched north and briefly occupied Beizhen County on the 15th, annihilating more than 100 enemy security troops. Another part of our army annihilated two companies of the bandit 49th Army's 26th Division near Xinlitun on the 17th. On the evening of the 21st, we again destroyed a section of the railway from Jinzhou to Jinxi. On the 24th, our army annihilated a battalion of the bandit Provisional 55th Division at Baiqibao, southwest of Xinmin, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 400, including their deputy regimental commander. Another part of our army approached Zhangwu. On the 27th, we cleared the enemy's outer strongholds. On the morning of the 28th, we launched a general offensive at 9:00 a.m. and completely ended the battle at 2:00 p.m., occupying the city. The entire defending 49th Army's 79th Division was annihilated without a single enemy escaping (Note: Two regiments of this division were annihilated in our autumn offensive and this is the newly replenished division), killing, wounding, and capturing over 10,000 enemies. On the same day, we also completely annihilated the bandit 207th Division's 2nd Brigade, 6th Regiment at Wanjintai, more than 60 miles northwest of Shenyang, annihilating and capturing more than 2,000 enemies. (3) South of Shenyang: From the 15th to the 19th, our army successively captured Zhangtaizi Station, Huazigou (i.e., Yantai Coal Mine), Heiyingtai, and Da'anping strongholds on the periphery of Liaoyang, and destroyed more than 60 miles of the Changchun Railway in the Liaoyang to Shenyang section, successively annihilating one battalion of the bandit 52nd Army's Transportation Regiment, the 3rd Battalion of the 75th Regiment of the 25th Division, and the Liaoyang local bandit Yu Zifang's troops, totaling more than 1,700. Another part of our army captured Dashiqiao in one fell swoop on the 19th, completely annihilating the defending Transportation Police 3rd Regiment, killing and wounding more than 1,200 bandits, including the battalion commander. The Haicheng defending enemy 52nd Army's 2nd Division, one regiment, abandoned the city and fled north on the 21st upon hearing the news. The city was then recovered by us. The Chiang bandit security team entrenched in Liaozhong, more than 160 miles southwest of Shenyang, also abandoned the city and fled towards Dahushan, intimidated by our prestige. In addition, our army in eastern Hebei continued to destroy the Beining Railway from Tangshan to Changli, and after recovering Leting on the 12th, we recovered Yutian County on the 18th, and then destroyed the railway from Changli to Beidaihe, providing strong coordination for our army outside the Guan.
