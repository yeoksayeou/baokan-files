Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 21st: Reports from various sources indicate that mass rallies are being held in many Indonesian towns and villages to protest the Dutch imperialists' insidious plot to organize a temporary puppet government (note that earlier this month the reactionary Dutch government approved the decision of the Dutch Governor-General Van Mook to form a temporary puppet government composed of eleven Dutch-occupied areas of Indonesia, including East and West Java, Celebes, Borneo, and Southern Sumatra). At a rally in Yogyakarta attended by thousands, Indonesian Communist Party Secretary Darjiman delivered a speech filled with a sense of certain victory, urging the Indonesian people to strengthen their unity in the struggle against the invaders. In Bandung (Dutch-occupied area), demonstrators, under the threat of enemy bayonets, shouted slogans such as "Dutch aggressors get out of our city," "Down with the traitors," and "West Java is an inseparable part of the Republic of Indonesia." Representatives of the people of Celebes, Borneo, and the Moluccas also gathered in the capital to support the government's determination to fight to the end and demand that the Security Council effectively safeguard the Indonesian people's just right to strive for independence. The Dutch military authorities in cities such as Bandung, in a state of panic, immediately declared a curfew at night and attempted to force the Indonesian people into submission through a policy of indiscriminate killing.

　　抗议荷兰制造傀儡政府
  　印尼城乡开群众大会
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】综合各方讯：印尼许多城镇与乡村都在召开群众大会，抗议荷兰帝国主义组织临时傀儡政府的毒计（按本月初荷兰反动政府已批准荷兰总督范·穆克的决定，即由东、西爪哇、西里伯斯、婆罗洲、苏门答腊南部等十一个印尼荷占区组成临时傀儡政府）。在日惹数千人参加的大会上，印尼共产党书记达维曼发表演说，洋溢着必胜信念，敦促印尼人民在反抗侵略者的斗争中加强团结。万隆（荷占区）示威群众在敌人刺刀的威胁下，高呼“荷兰侵略者滚出我们的城市”、“打倒卖国贼”、“西爪哇是印尼共和国不可分割的部分”等口号。西里伯斯、婆罗洲、摩鹿加诸岛人民代表亦于首都集会，支持政府抗战到底，并要求安理会切实保障印尼人民争取独立之正义权利。就缩万隆等城之荷军当局，惊慌失措，入夜即宣布戒严令，并妄图以滥杀政策压迫印尼人民就范。
