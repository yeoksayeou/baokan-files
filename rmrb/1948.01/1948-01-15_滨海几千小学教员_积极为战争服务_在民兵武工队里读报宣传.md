Xinhua News Agency, East China, 12th: Thousands of elementary school teachers in the Binhai area have actively served the war over the past year. In Rizhao and four other counties, 229 elementary school teachers participated in civilian labor teams. In Ju County and Zhuting (formerly Ganyu) counties, 92 teachers participated in armed work teams. In Tancheng, over a hundred teachers joined local armed forces and militias, fighting alongside them and conducting activities such as reading newspapers and performing entertainment. Teachers in various counties, as part of stretcher-bearer teams accompanying the army, adopted methods such as "acting out what they do, performing wherever they go," organizing marching evening gatherings, reading newspapers, and performing drum songs and folk tunes, greatly boosting the morale of the civilian laborers. Wang Kangqing, the principal of Nan Elementary School in Ju County, served as the chief steward for the civilian laborers, continuing to prepare supplies even after marching hundreds of miles, shouldering burdens alongside the laborers in the wind and rain. Teachers in the rear areas launched political offensives against the enemy. In Xukou and Tingshui districts of Junan County, armed propaganda teams were organized, conducting propaganda and visiting the masses in groups during the day, and coordinating with armed work teams at night to advance into marginal areas, writing slogans, posting leaflets, and convening mass meetings separately. The masses on both sides of the Tai'erzhuang-Weixian highway were familiar with teacher Zhang Jiuqing, and the saying circulated: "Old Zhang, Old Zhang, carrying a small pot and shouldering a big gun, writing slogans everywhere, explaining the truth everywhere." Teachers in Jiacang Township, Rizhao, went deep into the vicinity of the Jiang bandit stronghold of Shijiusuo, visiting local people affected by Jiang's disasters, and won over two Jiang soldiers to return to the fold in one night.

　　滨海几千小学教员
  　积极为战争服务
  　在民兵武工队里读报宣传
    【新华社华东十二日电】滨海区数千小学教师一年来积极为战争服务。日照等五县有二二九名小学教师参加民工队工作。莒县、竹庭（原赣榆）两县有九十二名参加武工队。郯城有百余名参加地武与民兵，并肩作战和进行读报、文娱等活动。各县教师在随军担架队中，采取“做什么演什么，走到哪里演到哪里”等方式，组织行军晚会及读报、大鼓、小调等活动，大大鼓舞了民工们的情绪。莒县南小学校长王康清担任民工司务长，由于行军百里后，仍筹备给养，在风雨中和民工一起挑担子。在后方的教师，则开展对敌政治攻势。莒南县许口、汀水两区组织武装宣传队，白天分组宣传慰问群众，夜间配合武工队挺进边沿区写标语、贴传单，分头召开群众会议。沿台（儿庄）潍（县）公路两侧群众均熟知教师张九卿，流传着“老张老张，提着小罐扛着大枪，到处写标语，到处把道理讲”。日照夹仓乡教师深入蒋匪据点石臼所近郊，慰问当地受蒋灾的群众，一夜间争取二名蒋军来归。
