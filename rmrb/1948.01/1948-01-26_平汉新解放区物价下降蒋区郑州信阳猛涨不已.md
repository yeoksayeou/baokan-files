Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui, 24th: Prices have generally fallen in the newly liberated areas along the Pinghan Railway. After Xuchang was liberated again, the masses who had fled when Chiang's bandits reoccupied Xuchang have returned to their businesses. Business is now very good in the shops, and vendors fill the streets. Four soap factories are increasing production daily, and five cigarette factories are producing 100,000 cigarettes daily. The prices of wheat, pork, cabbage, tofu, tobacco leaves, and other commodities have generally fallen by about 30%. After the liberation of Linying, 60 li south of Xuchang, the number of people attending the market has increased more than threefold. However, prices in Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Xinyang, which are still under Chiang's control, continue to soar. Flour has risen from 6,000 yuan to 14,000 yuan per jin in Chiang currency. The North Sea currency and the Jinan currency issued by the liberated areas' banks enjoy extremely high credit. Twenty-five yuan in Chiang currency can only be exchanged for one yuan in North Sea currency.

　　平汉新解放区物价下降蒋区郑州信阳猛涨不已
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十四日电】平汉路沿线新解放区物价普遍下降，许昌再获解放后，在蒋匪重占许昌时逃出的群众都已纷纷回家营业，现商店生意很好，摊贩满街。四家肥皂厂每天加工增产、五家烟厂，每天出烟十万支。小麦、猪肉、白菜、豆腐、烟叶等物价普遍下降百分之三十左右。许昌南六十里之临颖城解放后，赶集人数较前激增三倍以上。但蒋匪困踞下的开封、郑州和信阳等地的物价则继续猛涨不已，面粉由每斤蒋币六千元涨至一万四千元。解放区银行发行的北海币和冀南币信用极高，每二十五元蒋币才能折合一元北海币。
