　　“Standpoint," "Loopholes," "Satisfaction"
    Reflections on "My Landlord Standpoint in Dealing with Family Issues"
    Su
    After reading the article "My Landlord Standpoint in Dealing with Family Issues" published in the People's Daily on January 7th, I was greatly enlightened by his frank exposure of his landlord ideology, as I am also of landlord origin. I would also like to raise a few more questions for joint study. The purpose is to make us resolutely and thoroughly separate from the landlord class ideologically.
    First, the issue of "two standpoints": Comrade X reflected that after hearing the transmission of the May Fourth Directive, his "first joy (that contradictions in work were resolved) was standing on the work standpoint," and his "second joy (taking care of the family) was standing on the landlord standpoint." Comrade X’s handling of family issues is sufficient to prove that he was on the landlord standpoint, with no so-called work standpoint. He said that the policy of eliminating landlords "resolved contradictions in work." Judging from his family issues, not only were the contradictions not resolved, but they increased a lot. From the phenomenon, these contradictions may have changed somewhat compared to before the May Fourth Directive, but the essence of the contradiction—the contradiction between landlord and peasant—has not changed, and Comrade X's landlord standpoint has also not changed. His landlord family has not been eliminated. The fact that this standpoint has not been completely changed can still be seen in his reflection this time. For example, when Comrade X reflected on the issue of family division, he said: "It was not from the starting point of satisfying the peasants' land demands, but from the original class standpoint, delaying the division of the family, and preserving and shielding the landlord family." Doesn't this mean that if he hadn't delayed the division of the family, he would have been standing on the peasants' standpoint? Isn't this a joke?! In fact, it is precisely because you divided the family that you preserved and shielded the landlord! Instead of examining this point, you reflected on "one becoming two" after the division of the family (this is necessary, but it is far from enough if limited to this), isn't this exposing landlord thoughts from a landlord standpoint?
    Second, the issue of "three loopholes": Comrade X reflected that his mistake in dealing with family issues was exploiting three loopholes. It seems that if there were no three loopholes, he could have stood on the side of the peasants. I don't think this statement is correct. It's not a loophole issue, it's a standpoint issue. It's because he has a firm landlord standpoint and is trying to cope with all changes with the same old tricks. For example, first, he exploited the loophole of the county committee being "emotional." I think first of all, Comrade X treated comrades with landlord emotions. Therefore, the county committee comrades "had a lot of trouble dealing with my (Comrade X's) family." Is it because you (referring to Comrade X, the same below) have the "emotionalism" of the proletariat that makes people "have a lot of trouble"? Second, exploiting the loophole of the masses' lack of awareness, this is saying that the masses are so foolish that they are willing to go hungry and freeze, and don't want land and houses! Is this a fact? Third, exploiting the loophole of the May Fourth Directive, the May Fourth Directive's "taking care of" starts from the interests of the peasants. Who are you planning for?
    Third, the issue of "five satisfactions": What standpoint and what ideological emotions did Comrade X use to examine the "five satisfactions"? Why did he only reflect on his own satisfaction without reflecting on the serious harm to the Party and the masses? You were "taken care of," but what about the poor and hired peasants? The status of the anti-Japanese war veteran landlord was improved, the wife's status was improved, but what about the hired and poor peasants? Your family joined the peasant association, what kind of people did the peasant association become? You did this with the qualifications of a Communist Party county committee member. Has the Communist Party's influence among the masses been tarnished because of you? Secondly, after you did this to your family, in leading the land reform in the county, especially in dealing with the issue of anti-Japanese war veteran landlords, did errors occur in the line? To what extent was the loss to the county's peasant movement serious? Third, due to your landlord standpoint, what was the political and ideological unity of the county committee like? According to you, it was "emotional." If so, what is the harm to the interests of the Party and the people? The county committee resolution allowed you to not implement it for a "long time." What mistakes were made in organizational principles? It is hoped that Comrade X will resolutely stand on the standpoint of the hired and poor peasants, go further, continue to reflect deeply, and expand the results of the battle.

　　　　　　　　　　
    We have successively published two articles on the reflection of landlord thoughts, and today we have published an article containing critical opinions from Comrade Su. In order for everyone to thoroughly eliminate the influence of landlords ideologically and completely separate from the landlords, we hope that comrades working in various positions will actively participate in this movement of self-criticism and criticism. Whether it is self-reflection or opinions raised on others' reflections, all are welcome.

### “立场”“空子”“满意”  对“我对待家庭问题的地主立场”反省意见

　　“立场”“空子”“满意”
    对“我对待家庭问题的地主立场”反省意见
    苏
    我看了一月七日人民日报登载的“我对待家庭问题的地主立潮一文后，由于他坦诚的揭发了自己的地主思想，对于地主出身的我启发不少。此外还有几个问题提出来共同研究。目的在于使我们从思想上与地主阶级坚决的彻底的分开家。
    一、“两个立场”问题：某同志反省在听了五四指示传达以后，“第一高兴（使工作中矛盾得到解决）是站的工作立场”，“第二高兴（照顾家庭）是站的地主立场”。从某同志处理家庭问题上足可证明他是地主立场，没有什么所谓工作立场。他说：消灭地主的政策使“工作中矛盾得到解决”，从他的家庭问题上看，矛盾非但没有解决，反而增加很多。从现象上看，可能这些矛盾与五四指示前有些变化，而矛盾的本质——地主与农民的矛盾是没有改变的，某同志站的地主立场也是没有改变的，他的地主家庭并没有消灭。这个立场之没有完全改变，在他这次反省中还可以看出来的。如某同志反省分家问题时说：“不是从满足农民土地要求出发，而是站在原阶级立场上，拖延分家，保留和包庇了地主家庭”。意思是如果不拖延分家，就是站在农民立场上了。这岂不是笑话！？实际上正是由于你分了家，才保留了与包庇了地主呀！撇开这一点不加检讨，反而把分家后“以一当二”反省了一番（这是必要的，但只限于此就大大不够了），这岂非站在地主立场上揭发地主思想吗？
    二、“三个空子”问题：某同志反省他对待家庭问题错误是钻了三个空子。似乎如果没有这三个空子他就可以站在农民方面了。我看这个提法就不对头，那不是空子问题，是立场问题，是因为他有坚定的地主立场，以不变应万变要出来的花样。譬如，第一，他钻了县委会“感情用事”的空子，我看首先是某同志抱着地主的感情来对待同志的，因此，县委会同志“对我（某同志）家庭处理颇费周折”，难道因为你（指某同志，下同）有无产阶级的“感情用事”，而使人“颇费周折”吗？第二，钻群众觉悟不高的空子，这是说群众愚蠢到甘心情愿挨饿受冻，不要土地和房屋！是事实吗？第三，钻五四指示的空子，五四指示“照顾”是从农民利益出发，你为谁打算？
    三、“五大满意”问题：某同志用什么立场，什么思想情感来检讨，“五大满意”？为什么只反省了自己的满意而没有反省对于党、对于群众的严重危害呢？“照顾”了你，贫农雇农呢？抗属地主地位提高了，老婆地位提高了，雇农贫农呢？你家里入农会了，农会成了什么人的？你以共产党县委委员资格这样干，共产党在群众中的影响是否因你受到沾污？其次，你对你的家庭这样干了之后，在领导全县土地改革中，特别在处理抗属地主问题时，是否发生路线上的错误？对于全县农民运动的损失严重到什么程度？第三，由于你的地主立场，县委会在政治上思想上的团结如何？按你说是“感情用事”的，如此，对于党及人民利益的危害如何？县委会决议你可以“长时间”不执行，组织原则上犯了什么错误？希望某同志坚决的站在雇贫立场上，百尺竿头，更进一步，继续深入反省，扩大战果。    　　　　　　　　　　
    我们已先后发表过两篇对于地主思想反省的文章，今天又发表了苏同志写来的批评意见的文章。为了大家从思想上彻底消灭地主影响，与地主彻底分家。我们希望在各个岗位上的工作同志踊跃参加这一个自我批评与批评的运动。无论是自己反省也好，无论是对别人反省提出的意见也好，均一律欢迎。
