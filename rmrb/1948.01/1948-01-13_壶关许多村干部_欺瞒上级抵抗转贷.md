　　【Taihang Dispatch, 10th】In the second, third, fourth, and sixth districts of Huguan, in order to ensure that hired and poor peasants truly receive loans, district cadres directly inspected the relending situation in the homes of hired and poor peasants, discovering many cases of falsely reported relending (note: relending means converting loans that were not originally given to hired and poor peasants to them). In the Hejungou sub-district of the sixth district, a meeting of village cadres was convened on December 12th last year to inspect loans. It was found that the total of new and old loans was 2,646,000 yuan. Except for 25,000 yuan used in Qiaoshang to help one hired and poor peasant household buy a head of livestock, the rest was lent to village cooperatives and mutual aid teams. At that time, it was decided that the loans should be completely transferred to hired and poor peasants within ten days. Later, when village cadres were asked, they said, "It's been transferred!" On the 25th, district cadres inspected the village and found that only half (1,296,000 yuan) had been relended to hired and poor peasants, and 950,000 yuan had not been relended; Wangjiazhuang and Nanzhang had not relended a single cent. District cadres in the third district held a meeting in Jinzhuang to inspect loans to hired and poor peasants and found that village cadres had falsely reported at the sub-district meeting that "all loans have been transferred to hired and poor peasants." Of the 958,000 yuan in loans, only 10,000 yuan was actually lent to hired and poor peasants, and 748,000 yuan was still being lent to small-scale societies combining various classes, and 200,000 yuan was simply accumulated by village cadres and not lent out. Hired peasant Zhang Qiulu said: "Lent to small-scale societies, we only get 5,000 yuan, the deficit is too big, we can't borrow more even if we want to." District cadres in the second district visited hired and poor peasants in Hanzhuang and found that village cadres were deceiving the hired and poor peasants. After they returned to the village from the district, the 810,000 yuan loan to the small-scale society was not touched at all. Cui Houze (old middle peasant), the vice-chairman of the Guojiatuo cooperative in the fourth district, was even worse. He took back 200,000 yuan in loans and put them in the cooperative without lending them out. When some hired and poor peasants went to borrow, he privately added another three points to the monthly interest rate of three points, scaring the hired and poor peasants who were afraid they couldn't repay the money and didn't dare to borrow. After discovering these false reports, cadre meetings were held in each village to examine and trace the root causes of the problem. Village cadres in Hanzhuang confessed that they were "afraid that the small-scale society would collapse if the loans were relended"; some said they were "afraid that the hired and poor peasants would not be able to repay." These confessions are incomplete; they intend to use these confessions to cover up their selfish and self-interested thoughts of taking advantage of the poor and hired. Now district cadres in each district are supporting the hired and poor peasants, clearing the ideological stumbling blocks of the village cadres, and seizing the time to carry out relending. (We hope to continue to report on exactly how it is done. - Editor)

　　壶关许多村干部
  　欺瞒上级抵抗转贷
    【太行十日电】壶关二、三、四、六区，为了让雇贫真正得到贷款，区干部直接到雇贫家检查转贷，发现了很多假报转贷（按：转贷就是把过去不是贷给雇贫的款转换给他们）的问题。六区河峻沟小区，去年十二月十二号召集村干部检查贷款，发现新旧贷款一共二百六十四万六千元，除桥上用了二万五千元帮助一户雇贫买了一头牲口外，其他都贷到村合作社和互助队。当时决定十天里要把贷款完全转给雇贫。以后问讯村干部，他们说：“转啦！”二十五号区干部到村里检查，发现只有一半（一百二十九万六千元）转贷给雇贫，还有九十五万没有转贷；王家庄、南掌一个钱都没转贷。三区区干部在晋庄召开雇贫贷款检查会，发现村干部在小区会上说：“贷款都转给雇贫了”，都是假报告。九十五万八千元贷款，只有一万元真的贷给了雇贫，七十四万八千元都还在各阶层结合的小型社贷着，有二十万元根本是村干部积压没贷。雇贫张秋录说：“贷给小型社，咱只分了五千元，窟窿太大，想多贷也不行。”二区区干部到韩庄访问雇贫，发现村干部哄骗雇贫。他们从区上回到村，小型社的八十一万元贷款根本没动。四区郭家驼合作社副社长崔侯则（旧中农）更坏，领回二十万元贷款，放到合作社不贷，有些雇贫去贷，本来是月利三分，他私自又加三分，吓得雇贫怕贷上钱还不起，都不敢贷。发现上面这些假报告，各村都召开了干部会，检讨追病根，韩庄村干部检讨说：“怕把款转贷了，小型社垮台”；有的说：“怕雇贫还不起”。这些检讨是不彻底的，他们打算拿这些检讨掩盖那种自私自利、占贫雇便宜的思想。现各区区干部正在给雇贫撑腰，扫除村干部思想绊脚石，抓紧时间，进行转贷。（究竟怎样作的，希望继续报导——编者）
