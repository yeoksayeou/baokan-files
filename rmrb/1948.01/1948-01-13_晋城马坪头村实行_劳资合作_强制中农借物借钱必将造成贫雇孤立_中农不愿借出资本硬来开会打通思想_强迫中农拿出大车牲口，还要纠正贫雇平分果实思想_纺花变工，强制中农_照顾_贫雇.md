[This newspaper's news] The Jincheng Labor People's Daily published a message on the 28th of last month saying: "Mapingtou Village, Third District, has broken through the middle peasant thinking, solved the difficulties of hired and poor peasants, and implemented large-scale mutual aid of labor and animal power." This village did not mobilize the poor and hired peasants by thoroughly struggling against the landlords and fairly and reasonably distributing the fruits to solve the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants. Instead, it "mobilized" the capital and animal power of the middle peasants to "help" the poor and hired peasants who had not yet been liberated. When the middle peasants were unwilling, they went to "get through their thinking." "Breaking through the middle peasant thinking" is actually a top-down mandatory order that harms the interests of the middle peasants to "benefit" the poor and hired peasants. It is also described as "labor-capital cooperation," treating the relationship between middle and poor peasants as a labor-capital relationship, which is completely wrong. We believe that relying on the poor and hired peasants to unite the middle peasants is a complete line for implementing thorough and fair distribution. The practice of Mapingtou Village will create disunity between the middle and poor peasants, isolate the poor and hired peasants, and let the landlords and rich peasants watch the joke from the sidelines and escape the struggle. As a result, it will inevitably harm the fundamental interests of the poor and hired peasants, preventing us from truly realizing the Outline Land Law of China. We are now introducing this news for everyone to study: Mapingtou Village has 126 households, of which 25 are hired and poor peasants, most of whom only have one month's worth of food. The small hired worker Li Nuoshun and his wife have a total of four dou of grain. After giving it to his younger sister, he has to work as a hired hand for others. The carpenter Yuan Wangbao wants to go out to work as a carpenter, but his wife and children have nothing to eat right now; other hired and poor peasants either have no labor or no capital. The village held a village-wide meeting on the night of the 12th to solve the difficulties of the hired and poor peasants and implement labor-capital cooperation. However, it was immediately met with serious resistance from the middle peasants, and some middle peasants believed that this was the "equalization" in last year's land reform. Middle peasant Yuan Beifang said: "No, even if I can't afford to feed my livestock with wheat straw, I can still accumulate manure." After saying that, he left. Yuan Haishui angrily took out the cow he had obtained in the struggle and said: "Give this cow to you to use! Whether it gets thin or fat, even if it dies, it has nothing to do with me." The woman Yuan Xiaocai cursed behind her back after taking out half a donkey at the meeting: "What the hell are we liberating for! Isn't it just for others?" Yuan Lixun's woman didn't sleep all night, thinking that the struggle had come to her. Some even criticized the hired and poor peasants, saying: Can he be called a hired and poor peasant? We are also hired and poor peasants. Two kinds of thoughts also occurred among the hired and poor peasants: one was that this was great, and some of the extra fruits should be distributed; the other was that if there was no grain, there would be grain, and if there was no money to use, there would be money to use. On the second night, separate meetings were held for new and old middle peasants and hired and poor peasants. The old middle peasants discussed the difficulties of the hired and poor peasants and the methods of labor-capital cooperation. In addition to this, the new middle peasants recalled their previous lives as hired and poor peasants in order to enlighten and take the lead in solving the difficulties of the hired and poor peasants. The hired and poor peasants told of their current difficulties, such as lack of labor, livestock, capital, or food, and discussed ways to solve the difficulties. It was not until the third day that the thinking of the middle peasants was reversed: Yuan Xiaocai said: "After we have been liberated, we should also help the hired and poor peasants to be liberated. I am willing to lend half a donkey to the hired and poor peasants to use, so that both parties can benefit, and let the hired and poor peasants get more profit, so as to catch up with us." Yuan Beifang also changed his mind and was willing to help the hired and poor peasants. He said: "I am also willing to take out the cow that I got from the struggle for the hired and poor peasants to use and implement labor-capital cooperation." The old middle peasant Yuan Yuanlin said: "There is a way. In addition to lending our donkey cart to the hired and poor peasants, we also have a cart and three winnowing fans that we will lend out together, as well as woolen pockets. If they are broken, I will repair them, and if the furniture is broken, I will fix it." Shi Wenming said: "I am willing to take out 10,000 yuan to be used as capital for the hired and poor peasants." The hired and poor peasants also corrected the idea of relying on relief or "dividing the fruits" and wanted to implement labor-capital cooperation with the middle peasants. On the third day, the whole village discussed the combination of labor, animal power, and capital. Middle peasant Li Haishui said: "Let's implement a three-way combination. Those who have livestock contribute livestock, those who have labor contribute labor, and those who have money contribute money! After combining, the money earned will first give the hired and poor peasants a 30% dividend, and the rest will be divided according to work points regardless of whether they are hired, poor or middle peasants." Shi Wenming said: "Those who can transport should transport, those who can go down to the coal mines should go down to the coal mines, everyone should provide capital if capital is needed, and everyone should provide livestock if livestock is needed." Yuan Xiaocai said: "Our middle peasant women should help the hired and poor women. When they first learn to spin cotton, two liang can be equivalent to one work point, and weaving five chi of cloth can also be equivalent to one work point (middle peasant women spin four liang of cotton for one work point and weave one zhang of cloth for one work point)." Elderly people who cannot spin or weave can earn work points by twisting cotton rolls and taking care of children. Some people are even willing to give their dividends to the hired and poor peasants first, and then divide them for themselves in the future. The old mutual aid groups were also reorganized, absorbing the hired and poor peasants to help each other and exchange work. The group leaders were re-elected or elected from among the hired and poor peasants or those who came from hired and poor backgrounds. Then, specific organization was carried out, using a self-reporting method. Starting with the fourth group first, people could do whatever they wanted and engage in whatever they wanted. Li Xiaoniu reported that he could not run or carry things, but he could lead the young people in the group to pull coal and collect manure. Textile expert Liu Chunfeng was willing to lead the textile work and patiently pass on her skills to the hired and poor women. Yuan Lixun's woman "was willing" to give a mule cart to the group to use and lend out another 20,000 yuan as capital... Based on the existing conditions, a long-distance transportation group, a short-distance transportation group, and a textile group were established, which were divided into three subgroups: one weaving factory, two spinning factories, as well as a tobacco workshop, and a grenade-throwing handle. Other groups also adopted the self-reporting method to form various subgroups and implemented work exchange between large groups. For example, the first group had more labor, and the sixth group had more animal power, so they also helped each other and exchanged work. Now the whole village has begun large-scale mutual aid and is brewing methods for dividing dividends between the hired and poor peasants and the middle peasants. They also put forward slogans such as "Farmers all over the world are one family, helping hired and poor peasants get rich and settle down, and the famine of hired and poor peasants is our famine!"

　　晋城马坪头村实行“劳资合作”
    强制中农借物借钱必将造成贫雇孤立
    中农不愿借出资本硬来开会打通思想
    强迫中农拿出大车牲口，还要纠正贫雇平分果实思想
    纺花变工，强制中农“照顾”贫雇
    【本报消息】晋城劳动人民报在上月二十八号登了一条消息说：“三区马坪头村突破中农思想，解决雇贫困难，实行劳力、畜力大互助。”该村不是从斗透地主，公平合理分配果实上来发动贫雇，解决贫雇困难，而是“动员”中农的资本、畜力来“帮助”未翻身的贫雇。中农不愿意，就去“打通思想”。“突破中农思想”，实际上是自上而下的强迫命令，损害了中农利益去“为”贫雇，还说成是“劳资合作”，把中贫农关系看做是劳资关系，这是十分错误的。我们认为依靠贫雇农联合中农是执行彻底平分的一条完整的路线，马坪头村的做法，将会造成中贫农之间的不团结，孤立贫雇，让地主富农在一旁看笑话，逃避斗争。其结果必将损害了贫雇的根本利益，使我们不能真正实现中国土地法大纲。现特介绍这篇消息，供大家研究：马坪头村有一百二十六户，其中有廿五户为雇贫，大部只有一月粮食；小雇工李诺顺两口人，总共打四斗粮食，给了妹子外，自己又得给人家当小伙计过活。木匠原王保，想出去作木匠，但老婆孩子当下就没吃的；其他雇贫或没劳力或没本钱。该村即于十二号夜召开全村大会，为雇贫解决困难，实行劳资合作。可是马上遭到中农思想严重抵抗，部分中农认为：这是去年土地改革中的“拉平”。中农原北方说：“不能，哪怕俺的牲口喂不起喂麦楷，也可以积粪。”说完就走了。原海水生气的把在斗争中得到的牛拿出来说：“把这个牛给你们使吧！使瘦了，使胖了，那怕使死了，与我无干。”妇女原小彩在大会上把半个驴拿出来后，背后就骂开了：“翻他妈的什么身！还不是翻给人家了？”原立勋女人一夜没睡着，认为这是斗争到自己头上了。更有的指摘雇贫说：他能叫雇贫？咱也雇贫。在雇贫中亦发生了两种思想：一种是这可好了，多得的果实就该分些出来。另一种是以为没粮食就有粮食了，没钱使倒有钱使了。第二夜就分别召开新老中农与雇贫会议，老中农讨论雇贫困难与劳资合作办法，新中农除此外，还回忆以前的雇贫生活，以便启发及带头解决雇贫困难。在雇贫中诉说目前的苦处，如没劳力、没牲口、没本钱、或没粮食等等困难，并讨论解决困难的办法。第三天才扭转了中农的思想：原小彩说：“咱们翻了身，也要帮助雇贫翻身才对。我愿拿出半个驴来借给雇贫使用，双方得利，让雇贫多得些利，好追上咱们。”原北方也转变了，愿意帮助雇贫，他说：“我也愿意拿出斗争来的牛，给雇贫使用，实行劳资合作。”老中农原元林说：“有办法，除把咱的一辆驴车借给雇贫使用外，咱还有一辆车、三个簸篮也一齐借出来，还有毛连口袋，破了我补，家具坏了我修。”史文明说：“我愿意拿出一万块钱，来给雇贫作本钱。”雇贫中亦纠正了依靠救济或“分果实”的思想，要和中农实行劳资合作。第三天全村讨论劳力、畜力、资本结合办法，中农李海水说：“咱们实行三结合，有牲口出牲口，有劳力出劳力，有钱出钱！结合起来，赚回钱先给雇贫提三分红，其余不管雇贫中农按工分红。”史文明说：“能运输的作运输，能下煤窑的下煤窑，要本钱大家给本钱，要牲口大家给牲口。”原小彩说“咱中农妇女要帮助雇贫妇女，她们初学纺花，二两也可以顶一工，织五尺布也可以顶一工（中农妇女纺四两花一工，织一丈布一工）。”老年人不能纺织，搓花卷看孩子也可以顶工。甚至有些人愿意先把自己红利分给雇贫，将来再给自己分。又将旧有的互助组整顿了一下，吸收了雇贫互助变工，改选或推选雇贫或雇贫出身的组长；随后进行具体组织，将用自报方式，首先从第四组开始，愿意干什么就干什么，愿意搞什么就搞什么，李小牛自报不能跑，不能担，但能带领组里的小青年人拉炭、拾粪。纺织行家刘春凤，愿意领导纺织，并把自己的本领耐心传给雇贫妇女。原立勋女人“愿意”将一辆骡车给组里使用，再借出两万块钱来作资本……。根据现有条件，成立了长途运输组、短程运输组，纺织组又分三个小组：一个织布厂，两个纺花厂，以及烟坊，砍手掷弹把的。其他各组也采用自报方式，组成各小组，而且实行大组与大组变工。如第一组劳力多，第六组畜力多，也互助变工。现全村已开始大互助，并酝酿雇贫与中农的分红办法。他们并且提出了“天下农民是一家，帮助雇贫农发财安家，雇贫农的饥荒，就是我们的饥荒！”等口号。
