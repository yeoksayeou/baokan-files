　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 28th—In the land redistribution movement in various parts of Liaodong and Redong, over 20,000 emancipated farmers have joined the army. In Xingnong and Taiping and other four districts of Hailong County alone, more than 9,000 emancipated farmers signed up in five days in late December last year. After strict review, 4,450 people were selected and gloriously enlisted. Those who were not selected automatically organized reserve teams, preparing to participate in the next round. Following the previous 3,200 soldiers, more than 5,500 emancipated farmers from Dongfeng County poured into the main force on New Year's Day. Since the county held its first Emancipated People's Representative Congress in late December last year, and reorganized the county government, a conscription movement immediately swept through all 24 districts of the county. The masses conducted background and ideological checks on the recruits, checking not only within their own village but also in neighboring villages. In Xin Jin County, Andong Province, after the poor and hired peasant congresses were held in various districts, more than 3,700 young people and adults joined the army in half a month. The upsurge of poor and hired peasants joining the army in Xiu Yan County also caused a sensation throughout the county. Among the more than 7,000 people who joined the army, there were 253 model parents and virtuous wives who sent their sons and husbands to the battlefield. More than 5,000 emancipated farmers in the new and old areas of eastern Rehe joined the People's Liberation Army. In Erdaowanzi District of Jianchang East, the new recruits were formed into three large detachments according to class, platoon, and company before enlisting, staying in place for several days. After the initial land distribution in Yebaishou, everyone also asked to establish their own corps. Following the first establishment of the Yebaishou First Counter-Offensive Regiment, another 2,000 anti-turned farmers established the Yebaishou Second Regiment on the 5th of this month, which is also being planned.

  　辽热两万农民参军
    【新华社东北二十八日电】辽东、热东各地翻身农民在平分土地运动中又有两万余人参军。仅海龙县兴农、太平等四个区于去年十二月下旬五天中即有九千余翻身农民报名，经严格审查后，有四千四百五十人被选，光荣入伍，未被选取者均自动组织预备队，准备下期参加。东丰县翻身农民继上次三千二百人参军后，又有五千五百余人于元旦日涌入主力。该县自去年十二月下旬召开全县首届翻身人民代表大会，重新改组县府后，全县二十四个区立刻卷起了参军运动，群众对入伍者均曾进行查成份查思想，查完本村又查外村。安东省新金县自各区召开了贫雇农大会后，半月内全县即有三千七百多青壮年参军。岫岩县的贫雇农参军热潮也轰动全县，在七千余人参军中，出现二百五十三个模范父母和贤妻送子送夫上战场。热东各地新老地区有五千余翻身农民投入人民解放军。建（昌）东二道湾子区入伍前新战士均按班、排、连编成三个大队，在原地停留多日。叶柏寿初步平分土地后，大家也纷纷要求建立自己的兵团，继第一次成立叶柏寿第一反攻团后，又有两千反身农民于本月五日成立叶柏寿第二团，亦在筹组中。
