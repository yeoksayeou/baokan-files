    The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China has issued a letter to all Party members, telling them to properly implement the Land Law and equally distribute land with their poor brothers. In the past, some people felt that joining the Communist Party made them superior to the common people and allowed them to do whatever they wanted. Some Party members, after becoming village cadres, acted even more recklessly. Now, the Central Bureau has issued an order requiring all Party members to be open and transparent. The names of Party members must be made known to all farmers, so that the poor peasant leagues and farmers' associations can see who is suitable to be a Communist Party member and serve the poor, and who is not. Unsuitable Communist Party members must be expelled. Those who have made mistakes in the past must acknowledge and correct them, and those who have committed crimes must be convicted by the people's court. From now on, Party members will be supervised by the people. They must do whatever the poor peasant leagues and farmers' representatives decide. When dividing land now, no Party member can take more than their share, and they certainly cannot only take the good land. Those who have taken more in the past must return it. In the past, some Party members have sheltered landlord relatives and family members. Now, they must confess their mistakes, accept punishment, and anyone who does it again will be sent to the people's court to be punished. No matter what a Party member does, they must consult with the people and not force or take over everything. The Communist Party will rely on our farm laborers, poor peasants, and all farmers to supervise and educate their Party members. Everyone should give them more suggestions so that they can truly correct their mistakes and become good hired hands for the people.

    中国共产党晋冀鲁豫中央局发表了一个告党员书，告诉所有的共产党员说，教他们好好的跟穷苦弟兄们在一起实行土地法，平分土地。过去有些人觉得他们入了共产党就要比老百姓利害，想干啥就干啥。有些党员当了村干部更是胡作非为。现在中央局下了个命令，教所有的党员全都公开，党员姓甚名谁，都要叫全体农民知道，让贫农团农会看看那些人当共产党员合适，能给穷人办事，那些人不合适。不合适的共产党员一律要开除出去。过去办了错事的现在要认错改错，有了罪的要由人民法庭定罪。今后党员们要受老百姓管，贫农团、农代会决定了啥，他们就得办啥。现在马上就要平分土地，哪个党员也不能多分，更不能光分好地。过去多分了的，要退出来。过去党员里有包庇地主亲戚本家的，现在要坦白认错、受处分，谁要再办，就要送到人民法庭去办罪。不论那个党员办事情都要和老百姓商量通，不兴强迫，不兴包办。共产党要依靠咱们雇农贫农及全体农民来管教他们的党员，大家要多给他们提意见。让他们真正改错，做一个人民的好长工。
