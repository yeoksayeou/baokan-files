　　Border Area Masses Join Forces for Production
  　Middle and Poor Peasants All Get Moving
    [Jiaozuo News] In Gengzuo Village, located in the border area of Jiaozuo, the masses suffered from plunder by the Chiang bandits, resulting in a poor autumn harvest. After each household assessed its assets, they actively organized production to make up for the losses. The poor and hired peasants raised the difficulty of production capital. The government provided loans of 50,000 yuan to ten poor peasant households and two extremely poor households, and lent one *shi* of grain. Geng Jinhai's wife said: "When the enemy occupied the area, people suffered from cold and hunger, and the stubborn troops came to loot and arrest people indiscriminately. Our government provides loans and lends grain, fearing that we will suffer from cold and hunger during production. Everyone discussed that we should help each other in production. The militia persists in guerrilla warfare at the front, and the women in the rear engage in spinning and weaving with extra effort. The self-defense force and the old men open restaurants and make tofu, and three people organize a cart for transportation." Each woman contributes one *jin* of cotton as shares, organizes four spinning and weaving teams to set plans, and challenge each other.
    Later, it was discovered that some middle peasants were unwilling to help each other in production, fearing losses. The root cause was found to be the unclear accounts from last year's mutual aid and substitute farming. Everyone suggested that middle and poor peasants are one family, and not to let anyone suffer losses for nothing, clearing the old accounts, people can invest as shareholders. Each share is 1,000 yuan, more shares more dividends, less shares less dividends. The middle peasants' ideological problems were resolved, and they started working with the poor peasants. The women's spinning and weaving movement is also going very well. There are currently seventeen spinning wheels, and fifteen *jin* have been spun in three days, averaging three *liang* per person per day, and ninety-five *jin* can be spun in a month. Geng Lao'er said: "Don't look down on my wife because she is old, she is not lagging behind you in her work. We will definitely get new clothes before the New Year (lunar new year)!"

　　边地群众搭伙生产
  　中贫农一齐动弹
    【焦作消息】焦作边沿区耿作村群众因受蒋匪掠夺，秋禾歉收；经过各户算家当，积极组织生产来补窟窿。贫雇提出生产资本困难，政府贷款给贫农十户、赤贫二户贷款五万元，借粮一石。耿金孩女人说：敌占时候人们受冻受饿，顽固军又来胡抓八弄，咱们政府给贷款借粮，叫生产怕咱挨饿受冻；大家讨论应该互相帮助搞生产，民兵前方坚持游击战，后方妇女纺织加油干，自卫队和老汉开饭铺、做豆腐，三个人组织一辆大车搞运输。妇女每人入股一斤花，组织四个纺织小组订计划，互相挑战。
    以后发现中农有不愿互助生产，怕吃亏的思想。找出根源是去年互助代耕还出没算清帐。大家提出中贫农是一家，不叫白叫亏，算清了旧帐，可以来入股。每股一千元，入多分多，入少分少。中农思想打通了，跟着贫农干起来。妇女纺织运动也干的很起劲，现有十七个纺车，三天已纺出十五斤，平均每人每天三两，一月可纺九十五斤。耿老二说：你们不要看我老婆老，作活可不落你们后，咱们赶过年（旧年）一定换上新衣裳。（俊卿、满贵、保林、哲影）
