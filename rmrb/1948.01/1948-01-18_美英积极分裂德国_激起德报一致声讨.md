　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. A comprehensive Berlin dispatch: The conspiracy of American and British imperialism to establish a West German government has become more apparent. The authorities of the American and British occupation zones gathered the premiers of eight states and representatives of the Economic Committee of the Anglo-American Joint Occupation Zone to meet in Frankfurt on the 7th and 8th, and passed a vicious plan to split Germany that had been drafted by the US and Britain in advance. The plan stipulates the complete merger of the British and American occupation zones to establish a puppet government and to turn the Economic Committee "into the skeleton of a puppet government in the Joint Occupation Zone" (TASS). After the establishment of the Joint Occupation Zone, according to the Associated Press, Britain is merely a follower of the United States, and "the most important work will be the responsibility of American officials." The traitorous government of France, despite humbling itself before its American master, was still despised by its American master and thrown out of the Frankfurt conference. The Schuman government, feeling ashamed, even made a coquettish protest to the US and British governments on the 11th. This arrogant act of dismembering Germany by American and British imperialism has aroused unanimous condemnation from German democratic public opinion. "Deutsche Nachrichten" strongly criticized the "Frankfurt split conspiracy," pointing out that this was "a dark Thursday in German history" (note that the 8th was a Thursday). The Berliner Zeitung warned: "The unity of Germany has been utterly devastated in Frankfurt." The Neue Zeit angrily denounced this move as "a complete violation of the Potsdam Agreement and a serious blow to the unity of Germany." The Executive Bureau of the Democratic Women's League of Germany pointed out in a resolution on the 9th: "The Frankfurt resolution is a new step in splitting our motherland," calling on "all German women to rise up and participate in the people's movement for unity, justice, and peace."

　　美英积极分裂德国
  　激起德报一致声讨
    【新华社陕北十五日电】综合柏林讯：美英帝国主义建立西部德国政府的阴谋，已更加表面化。美英占领区当局曾纠集八州总理和美英联合占领区经济委员会代表，于七、八两日在佛兰克福开会，并通过了由美英事先拟好的分裂德国的险毒计划。该计划规定完全合并英美占领区，成立傀儡政府，把经济委员会“变成联合占领区傀儡政府的骨架”（塔斯社）；联合占领区建立后，据合众社透露：英国仅为美国的从仆，“最重要的工作将由美官员负责”。法国的卖国政府，虽对美国不惜卑躬屈膝呼爹称奴，但仍遭其美国主人的鄙弃而抛之于佛兰克福会议门外，舒曼政府羞赧之余，竟于十一日向美英政府提出了撒娇式的抗议。美英帝国主义此种肢解德国的狂妄举动，已激起德国民主舆论的一致声讨。“德意志新闻”力责“佛兰克福的分裂阴谋”，指出这是“德国历史上是黑暗的星期四”（按八日是星期四）。柏林新闻警告称：“德国的统一，已在佛兰克福受尽摧残”。新时报怒斥此举“为完全违反波茨顿协定，严重打击了德国的统一”。德国妇女民主联合会执行局九日决议指出：“佛兰克福决议是分裂我祖国的新步骤”，号召“一切德国妇女奋起参加为统一与正义和平的人民运动”。
