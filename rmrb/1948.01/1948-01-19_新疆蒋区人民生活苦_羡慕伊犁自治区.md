Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 15th: According to Shanghai newspapers, the people of Xinjiang under the rule of the Kuomintang bandits are living in dire straits. A survey of southern Xinjiang, known as the most affluent area, revealed that in Keping alone, out of 1,300 people, more than 1,140 had not made a single new piece of clothing in the past four years. In the northern Xinjiang area of Dihua, 80% of the people experience food shortages year after year. Other daily necessities such as tea, sugar, and cloth are unavailable even with money, and prices are constantly soaring. The Kuomintang bandit government is desperately issuing banknotes, and the printing presses are running day and night but still cannot keep up with the Kuomintang bandits' massive financial expenditures, which is the main reason for the soaring prices. Coal prices have risen alarmingly, and a family's coal expenditure is almost equal to its rice expenditure; the daily income of an ordinary civil servant cannot maintain the coal consumption of two small stoves. Therefore, the people in the Kuomintang bandit-controlled areas, living under high prices and material shortages, yearn for the Yili People's Autonomous Region, where prices are cheap.

　　新疆蒋区人民生活苦
  　羡慕伊犁自治区
    【新华社陕北十五日电】据沪报透露：蒋匪统治下新疆人民生活，处于水深火热中。号称最富庶的南疆，据调查结果：仅柯坪一地一千三百人中，就有一千一百四十余人在近四年中未曾制过一件新衣。北疆迪化一带，百分之八十的人民经年发生粮慌。其他的生活日用品茶糖布之类有钱也买不到，物价不断飞涨。蒋匪政府拼命滥发纸币，印刷机日夜赶印还供应不上蒋匪庞大的财政开支，就是造成物价飞涨的主要原因。煤价涨得惊人，一家人烧煤与食米的支出几乎相等；一个普通公务员每日收入不能维持两个小炉子的用煤。所以生活在高物价与物资缺乏下的蒋匪统治区人民，向往着物价便宜的伊犁人民自治区。
