　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 9th. The Financial Office of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region has recently decided that landlords and rich peasants are not allowed to withdraw any material assets they have deposited in public factories, shops, banks, and cooperatives. The government, shops, banks, or cooperatives will be responsible for inventory and registration, which will be allocated to poor farmers in remote mountain villages in the future. When farmers settle accounts for the hidden wealth of landlords and rich peasants, this fund should not be included in the calculation. Private shares and properties belonging to middle peasants and below should also be inventoried and registered, and the original owners should be notified to obtain proof from the new peasant associations in their respective villages, and their ownership should be fully retained. Private funds belonging to cadres should be proven by the original unit that they belong to, verifying that they were indeed obtained through their own hard work and production, and should be fully returned to them; if they were obtained through corruption or other improper means, they should be confiscated. In order to prevent landlords and rich peasants from secretly selling goods during the land reform period, all public enterprises and institutions such as factories and shops must go through the village's poor peasant leagues or new peasant associations when purchasing various goods and raw materials in the villages in the future, and are strictly prohibited from directly or privately purchasing any goods from landlords and rich peasants.

　　晋察冀财办决定冻结合作社地主富农资财
    【新华社晋察冀九日电】晋察冀边区财经办事处顷决定不许提取所有地主富农存放在公营工厂、商店、银行及合作社内之物质资财。由政府和商店、银行或合作社清理登记，将来调剂给山沟穷村贫苦农民。农民清算地主富农浮财时，不必将这项资金计算在内。属于中农以下的私人股金财物，也应清理登记，通知原主取得他所属村的新农会证明，一律保留他的所有权。属干部私人资金，由原主所属机关证明，确实是由自己勤劳生产所得的，一律发给，如果是从贪污和其他不正当方法得来的要没收。为防止土地改革期间地主富农偷卖物品，各工厂、商店等公营企业机关今后到村收买各种物品原料时，必须经过各该村贫农团或新农会，严禁直接或私自向地主富农购买任何物品。
