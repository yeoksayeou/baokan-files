　　Eliminate departmentalism and individualism
  　Our newspaper's purchasing agent punished for smuggling a printing press
    [Our Newspaper News] After the recovery of Shijiazhuang, Comrade Yin Deyi of our newspaper's purchasing department went to purchase printing equipment. On November 25th, he transported back a printing press. According to him, when he arrived in Shimen, the Chiang Kai-shek planes were indiscriminately bombing the urban area. He saw a folio letterpress in the original Railway Bureau printing house and thought, "If it is destroyed by enemy planes, it will be a loss to the revolution." Therefore, without asking for instructions or notifying the municipal authorities, he transported the printing press back. When the newspaper leadership heard Comrade Yin's report, they immediately gave him severe criticism, pointing out that this action was a major mistake. Because if this machine belonged to a merchant, privately transporting it back would cause losses to the merchant. If it was enemy and bandit material seized by the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, privately transporting it back would also violate organizational discipline. Comrade Yin Deyi was ordered to stay in the ongoing Three Check-ups study session in the newspaper at the time to deeply reflect on this "grab a profit" mentality and style, and a letter was sent to Comrade Huang Jing of the Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau to express apologies and self-criticism for lax education and management of cadres. At the same time, opinions on how to handle this matter were requested. Comrade Huang Jing replied, confirming that this machine was indeed enemy and bandit material, and that our region should handle Yin's personal actions ourselves.
    After 25 days of reflection, Comrade Yin realized that behind his thought that "If it is destroyed by enemy planes, it will be a loss to the revolution," there were many personal motives hidden. He thought of showing off and demonstrating his ability to his superiors, comrades, and newly married wife, "to replenish the printing factory completely and make the name Yin Deyi forever remembered in the hearts of the comrades in the factory." Blinded by these many personal motives, he forgot that "this is an act of violating discipline and stealing the fruits of victory achieved by the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region people through bloodshed and sacrifice." Comrade Yin expressed deep remorse and requested the Party to impose severe punishment, and wrote a letter to Comrade Huang Jing reporting the leadership's criticism of him and the detailed process of this matter.
    From Comrade Yin Deyi's reflection, the responsible comrades of this newspaper further understood the truth of the matter, believing that this "grabbing a profit" style was serious departmentalism, which only cared about the interests of one's own small unit and disregarded the overall revolutionary interests, resulting in damage to the Party's influence and urban discipline. This was irresponsible to the people and exploited a temporary chaotic phenomenon in the war. It was decided to give Comrade Yin Deyi a severe reprimand and dismissal from his job, and to give the purchasing department a warning. It was also pointed out that the reason why this matter was dealt with leniently was because the occurrence of this matter was mainly due to many errors and shortcomings in Comrade Yin Deyi's thinking, but also related to the leadership's insufficient education of comrades in the past and the imperfect nature of certain system regulations. Therefore, this matter will be used to educate the entire staff, thoroughly eliminate any departmentalism and individualism. And it is stipulated that from now on, in recovered cities, no personnel such as reporters, purchasers, and distributors are allowed to enter the city without official orders. Those who enter the city on orders must maintain a hard-working style, be honest and self-disciplined, strictly abide by discipline, and not take a single needle or thread, whether public or private property, otherwise they will be subject to severe disciplinary action.

　　肃清本位主义个人主义
  　本报采购员私运印刷机受处分
    【本报消息】本报采购处殷德宇同志在石家庄收复后，前往购买印刷器材。于十一月二十五日运回印刷机一架。据他说：他到石门时，正是蒋机滥炸市区，他在原铁路局印刷所看见一部对开铅印机，想道：“被敌机炸坏了是革命的损失。”于是没有请示与通知市政当局，就把这部印刷机运回来了。当时本报领导上听了殷同志这种报告，立即给予严厉的批评。指出这种行动是一个重大的错误。因为这部机器如果是商民的，私自运回就使商民受了损失。如果是晋察冀边区缴获的敌匪物资，私自运回也违犯了组织纪律。责成殷德宇同志留在当时本报正在进行的三查学习中，深入反省这种“捞一把”的思想和作风，并给晋察冀中央局黄敬同志去信，表示歉意，对教育管理干部不严作了自我批评。同时并商请对这件事情的处理意见。黄敬同志复信证实这部机器确系敌匪物资，对殷个人行动要我区自己处理。
    殷同志经过二十五天的反省，认识到自己在“被敌机炸坏了是革命的损失”的思想后面，藏着许多个人目的。自己想着出个风头，在上级、同志和才结婚的妻子面前表示自己的能干，“把印刷厂补充得完完整整，使殷德宇三个字永记在工厂同志的心目中。”在这许多个人目的的蒙蔽下，就忘记了“这是违犯纪律、盗取晋察冀边区人民流血牺牲的胜利果实的行为。”殷同志表示深为悔悟，请求党给予严重的处分，并把领导上对他的批评和这件事情的详细经过，写信报告了黄敬同志。
    本报负责同志从殷德宇同志的反省中，进一步了解了事情的真象，认为这种“捞摸一把”的作风，是严重的本位主义，是只顾自己小单位的利益，不顾全局革命利益，结果破坏了党的影响和城市纪律。这是对人民不负责任，钻了战争中某种暂时的混乱现象的空子。当决定给予殷德宇同志以严重斥责、撤销工作的处分；给予采购处以警告的处分。并指出：这件事之所以从轻处分，乃因为这件事情的发生，固然主要由于殷德宇同志思想上有许多错误和缺点，但领导上过去对同志们教育不够，某些制度规定的不严也有关系。因此以此事向全馆进行教育，彻底肃清任何本位主义与个人主义思想。并规定纪律：今后收复城市，无论记者、采购、发行等一切人员，非因公奉命不得入城。奉命入城者要保持艰苦作风，廉洁自守，严守纪律，不论公私财物不得拿取一针一线，否则要受到严重的纪律处分。
