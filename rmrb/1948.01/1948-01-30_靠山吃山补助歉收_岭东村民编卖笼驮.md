　　Relying on the Mountain for Subsistence, Subsidies Fail Due to Poor Harvest
  　Lingdong Villagers Weave and Sell Baskets and Saddlebags
    [Huguang News] Lingdong, a small auxiliary village in Baipo Main Village, Sixth District of Huguan, consists of eighteen households with seventy-eight people. This autumn's poor harvest, after calculating household assets, revealed that the entire village will be short of food for an average of three months, shocking the cadres and the masses. Under the leadership of Wang Guo Xi's principle of "relying on the mountain for subsistence," they first contributed three stones and three dou of rice and mortgaged a large hillside in Tucudui village to cut branches. This provided a foundation for winter production. The entire village has twelve full laborers, four semi-laborers, and five auxiliary laborers, totaling nineteen full labor equivalents, and four donkeys, all of which were organized. Starting from the fifteenth day of the tenth lunar month, calculating fifty days before the New Year, they will weave three hundred pairs of baskets and saddlebags, and fifty baskets. Each pair of baskets and saddlebags will be sold for 2,000 yuan, and each basket for 1,500 yuan. After deducting the hillside price, they will earn a total of 642,000 yuan. These tasks will require a total of 721 workdays, with each workday earning an average of 900 yuan. The four donkeys will transport coal to Hejian for sale fifteen times, earning 10,000 yuan each time, for a total of 150,000 yuan. Thus, the total earnings will be 792,000 yuan. Currently, they have woven 79 pairs of baskets and saddlebags, over ten baskets, and the donkeys have transported goods four times, earning over 50,000 yuan. Everyone has high confidence and guarantees to complete the task. (Zeng Fu, Ying Chun)
