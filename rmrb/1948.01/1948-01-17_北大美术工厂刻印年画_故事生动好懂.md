　　Peking University Art Factory Prints New Year Pictures
　　Stories are Vivid and Easy to Understand
　　[Our Newspaper's News] Recently, the Peking University Art Factory is printing three types of New Year pictures: one is a large portrait of Chairman Mao, one is a "Join the Army" picture, and one is a four-panel serial picture of "The White Haired Girl." All are meticulously and finely engraved, using four-color printing. Whether in terms of lines or color schemes, they are very suitable for folk styles. In particular, the "White Haired Girl" serial pictures tell a vivid story and are clearly and easily understood. The masses, after just seeing the samples, are rushing to buy them. They are currently rushing to publish them and will soon be selling them in large quantities. It is said that they had originally engraved several New Year pictures such as "Sending Food" and "New Door Gods." After the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau pointed out their shortcomings, they immediately convened a review meeting for the art group comrades and resolutely stopped printing those flawed pictures. After careful study and research, they engraved new ones. Their spirit of daring to correct mistakes, and preferring to sacrifice their own energy and resources rather than making political mistakes, is worthy of praise. It is hoped that they will create more works based on the stories of land reform in this region and the content of the "Outline Land Law of China" to serve the masses.

　　北大美术工厂刻印年画
  　故事生动好懂
    【本报消息】最近北方大学美术工厂正刻印三种年画：一是大幅毛主席肖像，一是参军图，一是白毛女四扇屏连环画，都是精心细刻，四色套版，无论线条和配色，都很适合民间形式；特别白毛女连环画，故事生动，又刻得明显易懂，群众刚看了样子，就争着要买。现在他们正在赶着出版，不久即将大量出售。据说，原先他们曾刻印了“送饭图”、“新门神”等几种年画，经中央局宣传部指出其缺点后，他们当即召集美术组同志举行检讨，毅然决然停印了那几种有缺点的，又经悉心研讨之后才刻出新的来。他们这种勇于改正错误，宁肯牺牲自己精力物力，不愿政治上犯错误的精神值得表扬。希望他们根据本区土地改革中的故事，和中国土地法大纲的内容，创制更多的作品为群众服务。
