Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Comprehensive report: The people's armed forces in Hunan and Hubei are growing daily, reaching over 25,000 people. According to a Shanghai dispatch on the 6th from the semi-official American news agency United Press, the activities of the people's armed forces have greatly increased in the vast area of 150 to 200 miles (450 to 600 li) along the border of Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Liu Xianghai's unit of over 2,000 men, part of the "South China Democratic Allied Army," recently launched a major attack on Guidong County, which borders Jiangxi and Guangdong, forcing Wang Dongyuan, chairman of the Chiang bandit's Hunan Province, to seek help from Chiang Kai-shek, the bandit chieftain in Nanjing. According to news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas: tens of thousands of the "Poor People's Corps," who revolted in 1946 in Chenxian, Guiyang, and Yongxing counties in southern Hunan to resist grain requisitioning, usury, and high rents, are now operating separately in the Qitianling Mountains between Yizhang and Linwu counties on the Hunan-Guangdong border, and in the Dupangling and Longhukou Mountains in Jianghua, Daoxian, and Yongming areas on the Hunan-Guangxi border. The Qitianling mountain area has now become connected with the powerful people's armed base areas in counties such as Nanxiong in northern Guangdong, and the Dupangling mountain area has become part of the "Guidong Liberated Area." Since the New Fourth Army under General Li Renlin entered Hunan last year, the people on both the east and west banks of Dongting Lake have risen up to organize anti-Chiang armed forces, which now number several thousand. They are active in Xiangyin, Pingjiang, and Liuyang in eastern Hunan, and in Anxiang, Lixian, Shimen, Cili, Dayong, Sangzhi, Yongshun, Baojing, Yuanling in western Hunan, and in Gong'an, Zhijiang, Changyang, Badong, Wufeng, Hefeng, Yi'en, and Laifeng counties in Hubei. A unit operating between Hengyang, Shaoyang, and Xiangxiang is well-organized and disciplined, and the Shanghai newspapers refer to it as the New Fourth Army. In Chaling County, the birthplace of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, at the foot of Jinggang Mountain, and in Youxian and Rucheng, and in Mayang on the border of Hunan and Guizhou, there are anti-Chiang armed activities. According to the above statistics, the people's armed forces are active in 28 counties in Hunan and 8 counties in Hubei, with more than ten units of the people's armed forces. However, all ten commissioners of the Chiang bandits in Hunan admitted at the "Provincial Security Conference" last September that every administrative region was under the threat of the people's armed forces, so the strength of the people's armed forces in Hunan is far greater than the above statistics. According to a dispatch from the United Press in Nanjing on the 5th, the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek has been shocked by the people's armed forces in Hunan Province and has recently established a "Changsha Garrison Headquarters" and a "Hengyang Headquarters" in a vain attempt to resist.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th: Shanghai newspaper reports: In the second half of November last year, the people's armed forces in Jiangsu and Zhejiang continued to attack Chiang bandit towns and transportation lines. On the 17th, a unit of the people's armed forces in the suburbs of Shanghai attacked Panlong Town, 40 li west of Shanghai, rushed into the Chiang bandit town government office, threw multiple hand grenades, and safely withdrew after a fierce battle with the bandits for half an hour. The people's armed forces in Changhua and Yuqian on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui advanced to the suburbs of Changhua City on the 25th and launched a fierce attack on the bunkers outside the city, causing the Chiang bandits to respond in a panic and consume a large amount of ammunition. The Chiang bandit county chiefs of Changhua and Yuqian counties urgently telegraphed the Chiang bandit provincial government for assistance. On the evening of the 27th, a Chiang bandit express train traveling from Jinhua to Hangzhou on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was ambushed by more than 40 people's armed forces near Zhengjiawu in southwestern Zhuji, who fired intensely with machine guns. The train turned off its lights, accelerated, and rushed to Zhuji Station before daring to turn on the lights for inspection. Chen Qi, the quartermaster of the Chiang bandit security team, and five others were injured.

Also: On the 19th, the people's armed forces in Yingde, northern Guangdong, killed Shi Deguang, a Chiang bandit section member who was escorting conscripts, and liberated five conscripts.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Comprehensive news from Chiang-controlled newspapers and periodicals: By the end of last year, the people's armed forces in Yunnan had expanded to over 44,000, more than doubling in one year (less than 20,000 at the end of 1946), occupying vast villages in 35 counties. The quality of the people's armed forces is improving daily. The fact that some teams have raised the patriotic and democratic banner and united with the people is an important reason for their rapid development. The distribution of the people's armed forces is as follows: (1) In the area along the Kuangbi-Shi Railway in southern Yunnan, including Mengzi, Shiping, and Jianshui counties, there are 5,000 to 6,000 men under Xu Shihao, the "First Column of the Democratic Allied Army in Southern Yunnan." This unit was only a small team of several hundred people in 1946, but has now expanded tenfold. Intellectuals from Yunnan Province have joined the unit one after another, organizing propaganda teams to call on peasants to oppose conscription and grain requisitioning. Long Yonghe's unit in Shiping has grown from several hundred people in 1946 to 6,000 to 7,000 people. The ethnic minority armed forces in the Puxiong area of Jianshui County have also grown from several hundred people in 1946 to over 2,000 people. In this area, including Jianjiu, Longwu, Yuanjiang, Xinping and other counties, there are also units under Bai Zhenggui, Bai Xiaoqi, He Guangrong, Xiong Shanzheng, etc., each with several hundred men and guns, actively operating. (2) In the Huxi, Qiubei, and Guangnan areas in the Panjiang River basin in southwestern Yunnan, the "Democratic Allied Army" designation has appeared among the people's armed forces. In this area, Luo Rihui's unit has grown to 2,000 to 3,000 people. Last winter, they repelled a Chiang bandit brigade's "suppression" campaign. Zhao Yonggui's unit of over 500 men in Mile and Kaiyuan routed a Chiang bandit battalion last autumn. Yang Tiyuan's unit in Luliang has grown to 6,000 to 7,000 men and inflicted heavy casualties on the "suppression" Chiang bandits a month ago. (3) In the Yizu armed forces in Yongsheng, Binchuan, Heqing, Dengchuan, and other counties on both sides of the Jinsha River in northwestern Yunnan, there are over 10,000 people. In addition to over 10,000 rifles, they also have over 1,000 pistols and are equipped with American weapons. (4) In Qiaojia, Ludian, Zhenxiong, Weixin and other counties in northeastern Yunnan, there is the minbian armed force of Xiao Lao Fei (note: in the local Jianghu slang, the surname Mao is called "Lao Fei"), Wang San's unit of over 1,000 people, which has also advanced to Bijie County in Guizhou. There is also Lu Xiqi's unit of over 1,000 people, operating across the borders of Yunnan and Kang provinces, and the "Democratic Allied Army" designation has also appeared in this area. (5) In Qujing, Zhanyi, Luoping, Shizong, Pingyi, Xuanwei, and other counties in eastern Yunnan, as well as Xingyi, Panxian, Zhijin, Weining and other counties in Guizhou, there are units under Tao Yongzhong, Li Dexing, Wei Guangxing, Zhao Huanran, An Xixian, Wu Ziyun, and Manzu An Dubang, totaling 4,000 to 5,000 people, actively harassing the Chiang bandits, forcing the 6th Regiment of the Chiang Yunnan Air Force Special Service Brigade and the county governments of various counties to build bunkers for defense. In addition, the units under Gao Cairan and Gao Ruyun in Simao and Ninger on the southern slope of the Mengle Mountains in southern Yunnan have grown to several hundred people. The minbian armed forces in Wuding, Luoci, Anning in the Pudu River basin in northern Yunnan, and Deqin, which borders Kang province in northwestern Yunnan, are all growing.
