【Taihang News】Poor laborers want to engage in winter production but lack capital. In some areas of Taihang, major problems have emerged in the emphasis on fully resolving this difficulty. Some village cadres are harming the interests of middle peasants, feigning "assistance" to poor laborers, and profiting from it themselves. Generally speaking, they use two methods: The first is to give poor laborers "empty shares" (completely copying the old methods of landlords and despots entering "heroic shares"). For example, Shexian First District, Shentou Village, proposed the slogan "Middle peasants should help poor laborers." The Qian Yueyi mutual aid team held a meeting to "mobilize" nine middle peasant households to give poor laborers empty shares. They even solemnly criticized the middle peasants, saying that their past claims of caring for poor laborers were false (last autumn, this team stipulated: for outside sideline work, middle peasants received three jin of rice per work day, while poor laborers received four jin of rice, but because the middle peasants were dissatisfied and resisted, and because the cadres were originally insincere, it was never implemented). They emphatically proposed (actually, they forced): This time, we must truly "care" for them. Subsequently, the nine middle peasant households were forced to say: "Our team actually invested 180,000 yuan (140,000 yuan from nine middle peasant households, 40,000 yuan from eight poor laborer households), and we will distribute dividends based on 240,000 yuan. The dividends from the 60,000 yuan of empty shares will be considered as care for the eight poor laborer households. Because we middle and poor peasants are one family!" Guo Qinglong's team also decided that a poor laborer household would enter 10,000 yuan of empty shares. This is called "middle peasants lending capital, poor laborers sharing dividends." More seriously, in Huyukou Village, First District of Shexian County, after five dark nights of "working on" the middle peasants' thinking, they "obtained" the middle peasants' "consciousness" and "willingness" and decided on a method to "take care of" the poor laborers. The Tonghe mutual aid team's method was: "Each time dividends are distributed (three times a year), middle peasants must 'voluntarily' give 10,000 yuan of dividends to take care of the disabled poor laborers in the team; they must also provide 900 jin of firewood per year to take care of the poor laborers without labor; poor peasants with no or little shares will also share dividends like middle peasants." The actions of cadres in Shentou and Huyukou Villages, who took it upon themselves to harm the interests of middle peasants to "help" poor laborers, also occurred in Xialing in Pinging County and Yangyu in Neiqiu County. They all gave poor laborers empty shares. The second method is to "mobilize" (actually, force) middle peasants to lend money to poor laborers indefinitely and without any compensation. For example, after five dark nights of "working on" the middle peasants' thinking in Huyukou Village, Shexian County, the Gonghe mutual aid team forcibly "mobilized" middle peasants like Liu Jiaxun to lend 190,000 yuan and 42 work days to the poorest peasants as shares. This practice has been very common in many villages in counties such as Zuoquan. This will inevitably lead to serious consequences, which is harming the interests of middle peasants, undermining the unity of poor and middle peasants, and ultimately isolating the poor laborers. At the same time, it undermines the policy of equal exchange in production mutual aid, and as a result, will break up the mutual assistance production of poor and middle peasants. The main reasons for doing so can be found in the following two situations: One is the purely speculative thinking of village cadres, in order to report achievements upwards and show that they are actively "helping the poor laborers"; the other is that village cadres want to cover up their monopoly of loans and over-occupation of fruits. In any case, it actually harms the real interests of poor laborers. For example, cadres in Xialing, Pinging County, kept 547,200 yuan of loans and did not distribute them in the cooperative. They said it was for centrally supporting poor laborers in weaving, but instead they gave poor laborers empty shares. This is clearly not really for the sake of poor laborers. At the same time, in terms of leadership, some places have also unconsciously approved the above-mentioned erroneous actions. They are blinded by narrow class views or blindly believe in their subordinates and make mistakes. For example, the method of "middle peasants lending capital, poor laborers sharing dividends" in Shentou Village, Shexian County, was praised by the county's small newspaper (Issue 58).

　　村干独占贷款投机报功
  　冒充照顾贫雇伤害中农
  　太行有些地方冬季生产毛病大
    【太行消息】雇贫想搞冬季生产，没有本钱。太行有些地方，在强调全力解决这个困难当中，出了很大毛病。有些村干部，用损害中农利益的办法，假意“扶助”雇贫，自己从里边讨便宜。总起来说，他们一般有两种作法：头一种是给雇贫入“空股”（完全抄用了旧时地主恶霸入“好汉股”的一套）。比方涉县一区神头村提出了“中农要扶助雇贫”的口号，钱月义互助组就开会“动员”九户中农给雇贫入空股。还一本正经地批评了中农，说他们过去说照顾雇贫是假的（这组去年秋天规定：出外搞副业，中农一工三斤米，雇贫一工四斤米，因为中农不满、抵抗，加上干部原来也是假意，压根没有执行通），强调提出（实际就是强迫）：这回一定要确实“照顾”。接着，九户中农都被迫的说：“咱组实入股金十八万元（中农九户十四万元，雇贫八户四万元），就按二十四万分红，那空入的六万元股的红利，就算照顾了八户贫雇吧。因为咱中贫农是一家人呀！”郭庆隆组也决定一户雇贫空入一万元股。这叫做“中农借本，雇贫分红”。更严重的是该县一区胡峪村，用五黑夜工夫“打”通中农思想后，“取”得中农“自觉”、“自愿”，决定了“照顾”雇贫的办法。同和互助组是：“每分一次红（一年三次），中农要‘自愿’拿出一万元的红利，照顾本组残废雇贫；一年还要拿九百斤柴，照顾无劳力的雇贫；贫农没有股金或少的，也和中农一样分红。”象神头、胡峪干部包办损害中农利益来“扶助”雇贫的行动，在平定西＠、内邱羊峪也同样发生，他们都是给雇贫入空股。第二种是“动员”（实际是强迫）中农无限期、无任何代价的借钱给雇贫。比方涉县胡峪村经过五黑夜“打”通中农思想，共和互助组硬“动员”中农刘家训等，借给最没法的贫农十九万元，和四十二个工，作为股金。这种作法，在左权等县好些村庄，曾是很普遍的。这必然会造成严重的恶果，就是损害了中农利益，破坏了贫、中农的团结，最后孤立了雇贫。同时从生产互助上，破坏了等价交换政策，结果会挑散了贫中农的互助生产。这么办的主要原因，检查起来不外以下两种情况：一种是村干部纯粹的投机思想，为了向上报功，显示自己是积极“扶助了雇贫”；一种是村干部为了掩盖自己独占贷款和多占果实。无论哪一种，实际上都是危害了雇贫的真正利益。比方平定西＠干部，留下五十四万七千二百元贷款，放在合作社不分。嘴说是为集中扶助雇贫纺织，可是反过来却给雇贫入空股，这明明不是真正为了雇贫的。同时在领导方面，有些地方竟也对上述错误行动不自觉的批准了。他们被狭隘的阶级观点所蒙蔽，或是盲目的听信下级而犯了错误。就象涉县神头“中农借本，贫雇分红”的办法，受到了该县小报（五十八期）的表扬。
