　　Oppose Oppression and Fight for Freedom
  　Jinling University Holds Another Strike
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: Nanjing, 28th -- Jinling University students have decided to strike in protest against the university authorities preventing the establishment of a student union and expelling eight students who presided over the election. Note: This is the second righteous resistance this semester caused by the Chiang Party's obstruction of the establishment of student unions. On November 26th, students at Nanjing Central University also went on strike in protest for the same reason.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Nanjing, 31st -- A demonstration movement for freedom and against oppression broke out here at Central University. More than 3,200 students, holding flags, protested against the Chiang Party's Ministry of Education for depriving the student union of its powers and illegally expelling students, demanding that the acting president of the university reinstate the eight students who were expelled the previous week. The student union delegation's petition pointed out that this illegal expulsion incident should be the responsibility of Sha Xuejun, the newly appointed Dean of Students Affairs, and demanded his resignation. The demonstration lasted for several hours until the acting president of the university agreed to submit the students' demands to the school affairs and administrative meetings, and then the demonstration procession dispersed. Note: This is the second demonstration that has broken out at Central University recently; on November 26th, there was a strike because the Chiang Party interfered with and suppressed the student union elections.

　　反压迫争自由
  　金陵大学再度罢课
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】南京二十八日讯：金陵大学学生为抗议该校当局阻止成立学生自治会并开除八名主持选举之学生已决定罢课。按：此为本学期蒋党阻挠学生成立自治会所引起的第二次正义反抗。上月二十六日南京中央大学学生亦曾因此罢课抗议。
    【新华社陕北四日电】南京三十一日讯：此间中央大学爆发争自由反压迫示威运动。该校学生三千二百余人，手执旗帜，抗议蒋党教育部剥夺学生自治会权力及非法开除学生，要求该校代理校长恢复周前被开除的八名学生的学籍。学生自治会代表团请愿书中指出：这一非法开除事件应由最近接任之训导长沙学浚负责，并要求其辞职。示威延续数小时，直至该校代理校长答应将学生要求提交校务及行政会议后，示威队列始散去。按：此为最近中大所爆发的第二次示威行动，十一月二十六日曾因蒋党干涉及压迫学生自治会选举而罢课。
