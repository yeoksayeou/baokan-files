　　[Our Dispatch] The CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region of the People's Liberation Army sent a telegram to mourn Comrade Zhao Jimei. The original telegram is as follows:
　　To Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng on the Central Plains Front, and Deputy Commander Li, forwarded to the Jianghan 12th Column:
　　Comrade Zhao Jimei dedicated himself to the cause of the proletariat and the liberation of the Chinese people from an early age. He was loyal, brave, simple, and hardworking. He made outstanding contributions to the creation and construction of our Ji-Lu-Yu area and the persistence and development of the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare. This time, upon receiving the order to advance south, he penetrated deep into the enemy's rear to establish a victorious base for the Central Plains campaign. Unfortunately, he fell ill and died during the victorious march. The sad news has reached us, and the military and civilians here express their deep condolences. We hereby express our condolences. In addition to having already sent someone to comfort Comrade Jimei's family, we also hope that all commanders and fighters will inherit Comrade Zhao Jimei's legacy, continue to struggle, and strive for the complete victory of the revolutionary war.
