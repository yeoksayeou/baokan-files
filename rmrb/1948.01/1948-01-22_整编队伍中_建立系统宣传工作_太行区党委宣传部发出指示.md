　　During Troop Reorganization
  　Establish Systematically Propaganda Work
  　Taihang District Party Committee Propaganda Department Issues Instructions
    [Our News] The Taihang District Party Committee Propaganda Department recently instructed the Propaganda Departments of various district committees to earnestly implement the spirit of the Central Bureau's Propaganda Liaison Conference, systematically establish their own work systems during troop reorganization, and establish a reporting system. During the reorganization meeting, pay attention to the general ideological situation of cadres at the beginning of the meeting; the ideological types of cadres of various components discovered through introspection, and their erroneous facts; the ideological leadership of the meeting, especially the experience and existing shortcomings in organizing and carrying out correct ideological struggle within the party; typical ideological materials; and the general ideological gains after studying. According to the decision of the Central Bureau Propaganda Department, after the complete and thorough land redistribution in the entire district is largely completed, prepare to convene a party education work research conference to specifically summarize the ideological situation of party member cadres during the land redistribution period, and the initial experience of building the party ideologically, especially to summarize the branch education work (including during and after the reorganization), so as to be able to formulate a party education plan for the second half of the year at the conference. In the land redistribution movement, the propaganda departments of the party at all levels must quickly establish a system of cultural committee members concurrently serving as party newspaper correspondents within the poor peasant associations, cultivate thousands of genuine worker-peasant correspondents, establish a new communication network to replace the old communication organization, and serve as the grassroots foundation for the true localization of the party newspaper. And prepare to convene a party worker-peasant correspondent conference at the same time as the party education conference, to initially summarize the experience of developing and establishing a worker-peasant communication network, and organizing them to write articles and read newspapers. At the same time, attention should be paid to collecting the reflections of various classes and aspects in the village after the promulgation of the Outline Land Law.
