　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Ji-Lu-Yu, dated the 31st] The Chiang Kai-shek bandits released floodwaters, causing the masses on both banks of the Yellow River to suffer greatly from the flood. In addition, this year, the Tai region experienced continuous rain, with flooded fields in only four districts of Hebei reaching 3.6 million mu, affecting nearly one million disaster victims. The current living conditions of these disaster-stricken masses are very difficult. To address this, the District Party Committee convened a meeting of local committees and decided to "vigorously develop sideline production in disaster areas." The Administrative Office decided to allocate 1.2 billion yuan to relieve disaster-stricken hired and poor farmers. The District Administration, based on the Finance Office's instructions on winter loans, has decided on the following: (1) Winter loans this year must be fully extended to hired and poor farmers. (2) Winter loans in disaster areas should be under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels. Loan recipients should maintain direct contact with the bank, and procedures should be simplified as much as possible. (3) The newly allocated funds must be fully loaned to disaster areas. Loans to non-disaster areas should generally be avoided, except for extremely impoverished villages. (4) Bank loan funds must be fully extended to the masses. No Party or government agencies are allowed to misappropriate them. Any borrowed funds must be immediately recovered. (5) Local authorities should coordinate with the Party committee to create detailed and specific plans for winter loan needs and submit them in writing to the District Bank through the Finance Office by the end of December. (6) When issuing loans, local authorities should encourage the masses to voluntarily organize mutual aid and cooperation, but without excessive emphasis. Loans can also be granted individually to impoverished masses without organizational restrictions. (7) Generally, loans should not be granted to cooperatives at present. However, production mutual aid societies genuinely organized by impoverished masses in extremely poor villages can be appropriately supported if they face difficulties.
    [This dispatch from our newspaper in Ji-Lu-Yu, dated the 31st] Liugu Village in the Fourth District of Qingfeng is preparing to intensify sideline production to overcome the spring famine. The village is a medium-level village, neither rich nor poor, with poor soil quality. Sandy soil accounts for 60%, and river land accounts for 20%. Only a good piece of land lies west of the village. The village has 241 households with 998 people. According to investigations, only 73 households have enough food. The remaining 168 households are short of more than 43,000 jin of grain until the next wheat harvest. The village masses plan to overcome the spring famine by opening small workshops and engaging in transportation. The village has a total of 36 households that regularly sell tofu, and 59 households that make iron tools, steamed buns, and pancakes for sale. There are 11 mutual aid teams, with a total of seven or eight large carts, 22 flatbed carts, and three small carts, running to Shunde and Handan all day long, carrying wheat and returning with iron goods. Bao Qiushan, who sells tofu, has a family of six. He planted 11 mu of autumn crops and harvested a total of 840 jin of grain, with 480 jin remaining. He is short of 196 jin of grain until the next wheat harvest. He is trying to sell tofu, averaging one a day, earning 1,600 yuan, which can buy one dou of sorghum (sorghum costs about 1,500 yuan per dou). Currently, the masses in the village are stepping up the opening of workshops and transportation production to prepare for overcoming the spring famine next year.
