　　[Taiyue News] The local armed forces of the Western Henan Military Sub-district, in the Luoning and Yiyang areas, have been clearing out landlord armed forces. In seven days, they killed, wounded, and captured a total of more than 250 people, achieving great results. On December 29th and 31st, our local corps, militia, and guerrillas jointly repelled the disturbances of the seven bandits Ye Laoliu and Feng Kegong in the riverbed area about 50 miles northeast of Luoning, killing and wounding 52 of them. On January 2nd, another part of our local armed forces ambushed the bandit Zhang Xingkui and his men near Xiaoshijie, more than 30 miles northwest of Luoning, killing and wounding more than 20 of them. On the 4th, at dawn, a part of our local corps ambushed in the Wuyuegou area, more than 60 miles west of Yiyang, and captured the bandit Feng Kegong's squad leader and two others. Because the wind was very strong that day, and visibility was poor, most of the bandits fled towards Yiyang. On the afternoon of the 5th, we again eliminated the local landlord and secret agent armed forces in the Shuigoumiao area, more than 40 miles northeast of Luoning. From 2:00 PM to midnight, we eliminated most of the bandits in the Shuigoumiao, Xiamagou, Dongwang, Gucun, and Bopo areas, killing more than 150 and wounding more than 30.

　　[Taiyue News] Xinan County in western Henan is a newly liberated area. The farmers' militia who have turned over a new leaf have learned the skills of guerrilla warfare and landmine warfare from the militia in the old liberated areas, and have achieved good results. On January 4th, southwest of Hengshi Town, a group of bandits detonated our landmine, killing two and wounding three, as well as killing one of their animals. Another group of bandits also had one man killed by a landmine in Shiduopo. At dawn on the 8th, Comrade Li Zhifang, the head of Xinan County, led the guerrillas of the second and fourth districts and the militia of the first district to surround Wang Shangli's gang of bandits, more than 30 in total, at Wangtou Temple, south of Hengshi Town, and wiped them out cleanly. More than 30 people, including those captured alive and their weapons, were taken. The militia and guerrillas in the Caocun area of ​​West Sixth Bao (more than 40 miles northwest of Xinan County) not only repelled the enemy's attack, but now there are no bandits in West Sixth Bao. We took advantage of the victory to move to the Wangdingshan area, more than 20 miles northwest of Xinan, to carry out work there. These achievements have been praised by the leaders of the military region, who have specifically asked the counties and districts in the newly liberated areas to learn from them.

    【太岳消息】豫西分区地方武装，在洛宁、宜阳一带剿灭地主武装，七天中打死打伤和活捉的一共有二百五十多个，成绩很大。十二月二十九日和三十一日两天，我们的地方兵团和民兵、游击队，在洛宁东北五十来里的河床一带，一块儿打退了七匪叶老六、冯克功的扰害，打死打伤他们五十二个。一月二日，我们另一部分地方武装，在洛宁西北三十多里的小石街一带，打了一个埋伏，把土匪张杏魁带的人马打得死伤了二十多个。四日，那天刚明的时候，我们的一部地方兵团，在宜阳西面六十多里的五岳沟一带打埋伏仗，活捉了土匪冯克功的小队长等两个人，因为那天风刮的很大，看不清楚，大部土匪是朝宜阳逃跑了。五日的下午，我们又在洛宁东北四十多里的水沟庙一带，消灭那里的地主、特务武装，从下午两点钟打到半夜，就把水沟庙、下马沟、东王、古村、伯坡一带土匪大部给消灭，打死一百五十多个，打伤三十多个。
    【太岳消息】豫西新安县是新解放区，翻身民兵跟上老解放区民兵学会了打游击的本领，也学会了地雷战，还搞得有成绩。一月四日那天，横氏镇西南，有一股土匪中了咱们的地雷，炸死他两个人，炸伤三个人，还炸死他一头牲口。另外一股土匪，到石夺坡也叫地雷炸死一个。八日天明，新安县县长李之放同志带着二、四两区游击队和一区民兵把王尚礼这股土匪共三十多人包围在横氏镇南面的望头庙，干干净净消灭了。活捉的连人带枪有三十多，咱们西六保（新安县西北四十多里）曹村一带的民兵游击队，不只打退了敌人进攻，现在西六保已没有土匪。咱们又趁胜出动到新安西北二十里的望顶山一带，在那里开辟工作。这些成绩都受到军区首长的表扬，特别叫新解放区的县区都向他们学习。
