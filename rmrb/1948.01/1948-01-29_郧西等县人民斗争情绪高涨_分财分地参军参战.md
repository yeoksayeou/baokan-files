Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 27th. When a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army advanced along the Hanshui River and liberated the Yunxi and Yunxian areas in northwestern Hubei, the local people showed high fighting spirit. Under the leadership of the democratic county government, they distributed floating wealth and land and actively joined the army and participated in the war. Before the battle to liberate Yunxian, the democratic government planned to mobilize 500 laborers, but more than 800 came voluntarily the next morning. When the troops set out, the masses in villages along the way automatically boiled water and cooked food. The participating laborers carried siege equipment, crossed 140 miles of mountain roads, and sang the song "Support the People's Liberation Army" with high spirits. After the liberation of Yunxian, the masses from all the surrounding villages rushed to help transport materials, and many people also requested to join the People's Liberation Army. When the troops held a celebration meeting in the city, thousands of people inside and outside the city came to congratulate them with gongs and drums, carrying gifts and congratulatory banners, with the names of the gift-givers written on the gifts. The troops refused to accept the gifts, but the masses insisted, "You have done a great service and should accept them."

Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 27th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army advancing into southern Shaanxi has fought successively on both sides of the Dan River, liberating the county towns and vast rural areas of Shangnan, Shanyang, and Zhen'an. Because of frequent battles, there was a shortage of shoes and socks, and many commanders and fighters walked barefoot. However, our army's morale was high, and we always adhered to the mass discipline of not taking a single needle or thread from the people. We also came up with all sorts of ways to overcome difficulties. During lulls in battle, we learned to make cloth shoes, cut hemp and collect grass to make straw sandals. Now, 100% of the army has learned to make straw sandals, and 90% have learned to make cloth shoes, solving the problem of footwear.

　　郧西等县人民斗争情绪高涨
  　分财分地参军参战
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十七日电】解放军某部挺进汉水沿岸，解放鄂西北的郧西和郧县地区时，当地人民斗争情绪高涨，在民主县政府领导下分浮财分土地并积极参军参战。解放郧县战斗前，民主政府计划动员民夫五百名，第二天早晨却自动来了八百多名。部队出动时，沿路各村群众自动烧水、做饭，参战民夫抬着攻城器材，越过一百四十里山路，高唱“拥护解放军”歌，情绪昂奋。郧县解放后，四乡群众都赶来帮助搬运物资，许多人还要求参加解放军。当部队在城关召开贺功大会时，城内城外群众几千人打着锣鼓，带着礼物、贺旗，赶来祝贺，礼物上并写着送礼人的姓名。部队不肯收礼，群众坚持说：“你们有功劳应当接受。”
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十七日电】挺进陕南的解放军某部转战丹江两岸，曾先后解放商南、山阳、镇安等县城及广大乡村。因为征战频繁，发生鞋袜困难，许多指战员都赤脚走路，但是我军士气旺盛，始终坚持秋毫无犯的群众纪律，并想出一切办法克复困难，利用战斗间隙学作布鞋割须雀草打草鞋，现全军已百分之百学会打草鞋，百分之九十学会做布鞋，解决了穿鞋的困难。
