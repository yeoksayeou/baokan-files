Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th. Five-thirds of the urban area of Weihaiwei has been recovered by our forces. From the 20th to the 22nd of last month, our army launched a strong attack on enemy strongholds such as Qiaonan and Qiaobei in the city, seized the enemy's important commanding heights, Baquan Bathhouse, Donghai Restaurant, and other buildings, and effectively controlled the water connection between Liugong Island and the wharves in the city controlled by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. At the same time, the guerrillas active in the city launched fierce bombing campaigns, compressing the enemy into the area around the Whale Bone Garden. The headquarters of the 166th Brigade, the regimental headquarters of the 497th Regiment, and the Public Security Bureau of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, which had moved into the city at the beginning of last month, have fled to Hefei and other villages eight miles northeast of the city. The enemy artillery unit in Whale Garden Village has also fled. At present, the entire urban area, except for six and a half villages including Weigudong Wharf (the southern part of Chengdong Village has been recovered by our forces), the remaining nine and a half villages including Wenquan and Ximenwai have all been recovered. The democratic government has issued interest-free loans and 6,867 catties of grain and 40,706 catties of fuel to relieve the masses. In total, our local military and civilians have annihilated more than 1,500 enemies in heroic battles from October 23rd to the end of last year.

　　威海卫市大部光复
    【新华社华东十五日电】威海卫市区已有五分之三为我收复。我军于上月二十至二十二日强攻市内桥南、桥北等据点，夺取了敌重要制高点宝泉澡堂、东海饭店一带楼房，有力地控制了刘公岛和市内码头间蒋匪的水上联络。同时，活跃于市内的游击队则展开猛烈爆炸战，将敌压缩到鲸骨花园一带。上月初旬始搬入市内的蒋匪一六六旅旅部、四九七团团部及公安局等，已逃往市东北八里之合肥等村。鲸园村敌炮兵部队，亦已逃走。现整个市区除威谷东码头等六个半村（城东村南部为我收复）外，其余温泉、西门外等九个半村全告收复。民主政府已发放无利贷款及粮食六八六七斤，燃料四○七○六斤，救济群众。总计我当地军民自去年十月二十三日至年底期间，在英勇奋战中，共已歼敌一千五百余名。
