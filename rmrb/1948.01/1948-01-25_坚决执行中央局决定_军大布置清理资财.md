　　Resolutely Implement the Central Bureau's Decision
  　Military University Arranges for Inventory of Assets
    [Our Dispatch] At a meeting of all Military University company-grade and above cadres on the 6th of this month, Education Director Zhao, representing the school committee, conveyed the spirit of the military region education conference. When mentioning the Central Bureau's call to support the front lines, he requested all responsible cadres and units in the school to conscientiously summarize all production and register all assets. The main spirit of doing this is to unify financial management, avoid waste, overcome financial difficulties, support the great counter-offensive, and strive for an early victory. Education Director Zhao pointed out: We must resolutely respond to the call of the Central Bureau and military region leaders, thoroughly register all assets, and honestly prepare to hand over every bit. We must oppose hiding things, oppose any departmental or personal plans, proceed from the overall interests, think about the victory of the entire patriotic self-defense war, and consciously, happily, thoroughly, and completely hand everything over. Education Director Zhao also pointed out: We must, in the spirit of land reform study, carefully examine our work style and check whether we have had any behavior of making false reports or drawing pay for nonexistent personnel in the past. We also hope this examination will be conscious and thorough. On this issue, we will not emphasize ideological work. If anyone does not consciously and readily thoroughly register all assets, still hides things, or does not consciously examine themselves, they will be subject to strict disciplinary sanctions.

    【本报消息】本月六日军大全校排级以上干部会上，赵教育长代表校委会，传达军区教育会议精神。提到中央局号召支援前线精神时，要求全校各负责干部、各单位切实认真总结所有生产，登记一切资财。这样作的主要精神，就是统一财政管理，避免浪费，克服财经困难，支援大反攻，争取早日胜利。教育长指出：我们一定要坚决响应中央局及军区首长的号召，把所有资财都彻底清理登记，老老实实一点一滴都准备交出来。反对打埋伏，反对任何本位打算或个人打算，要从整个利益出发，为整个爱国自卫战争的胜利着想，自觉的愉快的彻底干净全部交出来。赵教育长还指出：我们要根据土改学习的精神，好好检查我们的作风，检查我们过去是否有虚报或吃空额等行为，这种检查也希望自觉彻底。在这个问题上，不强调打通思想，不论什么人，若不自觉的痛快的把一切资财彻底清理登记，还打埋伏，不自觉检查等情形，则将受到严格的纪律制裁。
