Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th. Our correspondents report that the KMT bandits trapped in the isolated cities of Jilin and Changchun are short of food, coal, and electricity, and are approaching a dead end. As early as when the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive began last year, the defending enemies in Changchun had already lost the only Jilin-Changchun Railway and the Xiaofengman high-voltage power lines. The puppet organizations that they had prepared to seize autumn grain from the countryside were also wiped out by our counter-attacking army. The KMT bandit troops guarding the city can only fill their stomachs with thin porridge. The doors, windows, boxes, cabinets, farm implements, and nearby trees of the residents in Erdaohaozi and other places have been chopped down by the bandit troops for building bunkers and cooking. As soon as winter began, the bandit soldiers secretly dismantled the newly built bunker wood to burn for warmth. There is no electricity or running water in the city. Only a few high-ranking KMT military officers monopolize the small amount of electricity from the thermal power generators. By the beginning of November, when the coal reserves were exhausted, even this pitiful power source was gone. The KMT bandit troops were forced to defend this isolated city in darkness.

The KMT bandits' supply difficulties have reached the extreme. The New 1st Army, which was once known as the "Sons of Heaven," only has cotton trousers that reach their calves this winter, and half of their hands are exposed from their sleeves. Each person only receives a bowl of sorghum rice a day, mixed with half soybeans. The vegetable allowance of "circulating coupons" is 220 yuan (equivalent to 2,200 KMT currency), which is not even enough to boil water. Dismantling houses has become a money-making avenue for the bandit troops. Hongxi Street near the Higher Court, the buildings at the airport, and the residential areas of the puppet Manchukuo officials formerly known as "South New Capital" are now a scene of rubble. The bandit officers even forced soldiers to collect civilian carts, dismantle them into wood, and sell them on the market. The only way out for the hungry and cold people in the isolated city is to ignore the bandit troops' ban and escape to the liberated areas through the strict KMT military cordon lines. The bandit troops are also surrendering to us one after another, with more than twenty or thirty people every day. On the Jilin-Changchun line controlled by the liberated areas, this kind of fleeing crowd and surrendering KMT soldiers are constantly appearing.

Another isolated city, Jilin, saw the bandit leader and provincial chairman Liang Huasheng, who also happened to be a major grain merchant, take the opportunity to hoard grain during the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive. Rice prices soared, and the bandit soldiers could not eat their fill. For example, soldiers of the 22nd Division ate only two meals of thin porridge a day, and new recruits were only given some bean dregs to fill their stomachs. The mountains and forests of Xiaofengman were occupied and felled by the 60th Army, so the price of firewood also rose sharply. Slippery wood firewood was sold for 500 or 600 yuan per catty. Sorghum rice and mixed noodles have become recognized luxuries, and bean cakes are even sold by the catty. One thousand yuan can only buy a small tube of bean dregs. Under these circumstances of exorbitant prices, people have no way to make a living, and dozens of people die of starvation in the city every day. Many citizens flock to the gate of the KMT provincial government to beg for food, and rice-snatching riots have already occurred. The bandit troops attempted to grab grain from the liberated areas, but were repelled by the local people's armed forces only thirty miles outside the city.

The KMT bandits, who have run out of options in the encirclement of the People's Liberation Army, are in a state of panic day and night. A curfew is imposed after dusk, and gunfire echoes throughout the city all night. Passwords are changed seven or eight times every night. The morale of the KMT army is low, and a mood of homesickness and war-weariness prevails. Following the mutiny of eight soldiers from the 60th Army's direct manpower transportation team on December 13th, who killed their platoon deputy and deserted with their guns, five soldiers from the Jilin Assault Team also defected to the People's Liberation Army with a heavy machine gun. By mid-December, 40 soldiers from the KMT 60th Army had surrendered to our Eastern Manchuria Liberation Regiment. The Second Regiment of the Provisional 52nd Division had dwindled from 1,700 men to only 500. The desertion of the KMT New 1st Army is also increasing day by day. In the month of December last year, the Fourth Company of the 99th Regiment of the New 30th Division under the jurisdiction of the army had more than 40 deserters in just half a month. Although the KMT military officers used the cruel punishment of burying deserters alive to suppress them, it was still ineffective. The soldiers all said, "The more you kill, the more we will escape. Anyway, we can't freeze or starve to death with you."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. According to a Shanghai dispatch from foreign news agencies on the 13th: The Chennault Air Transport Team, established by American imperialists to assist Chiang in smuggling and waging the civil war, recently received an "urgent notice" requiring the team to be responsible for airlifting military supplies from Beiping to Shenyang. The team will also sign a contract with the KMT bandits to transport 7,000 civil servants from Shenyang for evacuation. It is reported that when Fu Zuoyi left Shenyang this time, the plane he was on was crowded with people trying to escape the city, but except for Fu's close cronies, the rest were expelled. The panic of the bandits in the city can be seen from this.

### 长春吉林已成死城　市内粮煤电水都缺　居民蒋军大批逃亡

　　长春吉林已成死城
  　市内粮煤电水都缺
  　居民蒋军大批逃亡
    【新华社东北十六日电】总分社记者报导吉、长蒋匪困守孤城缺粮缺煤缺电，已临日暮途穷的窘境称：早在去年解放军秋季攻势开始时，长春守敌即已失掉仅有的吉长铁路、和小丰满高压电线路，其准备用以抢夺秋粮的回乡伪组织，也被我反攻大军一扫而光。守城蒋匪军只能以稀粥充饥。二道河子等地民家门窗、箱柜、农具和该地附近的树木，都被匪军砍光，作为修地堡、煮饭之用，冬天刚开始，匪兵已将新修好的地堡的木料偷偷拆去烤火。市内没有电和自来水，只有匪军少数高级官员独占着火力发电机的少数电力。到十一月初存煤用完，就连这可怜的电源也没有了，蒋匪军便在黑暗中死守着这座孤城。
    蒋匪补给之困难达于极点，素称“天之骄子”的新一军，今冬棉裤只到腿肚子，两袖露出半截手。每人每天伙食只发一碗高粱米，里面还掺一半大豆，菜金“流通券”二百二十元（合蒋币二千二百元）连烧开水也不够。拆房子成了匪军的生财大道，高等法院附近的洪熙街和飞机场的建筑，及过去称为“南新京”的伪满官吏住宅区，现在都变成一片瓦砾场。匪军官们更强迫士兵征集民间大车，拿来拆成木料在市上出卖。孤城中饥寒交迫的老百姓唯一出路，就是不顾匪军禁令，通过森严的匪军警戒线，逃到解放区来，匪军也纷纷向我投诚，每天都在二三十人以上。在解放区控制的吉长线上，不断的出现着这种逃难的人群与投诚的蒋军。
    另一孤城吉林，在去年解放军秋季攻势期中，身兼大粮商的匪首省主席梁华盛，即乘机大囤粮食，米价大涨，匪军士兵则不得饱食，如二十二师士兵日食两顿稀粥，新兵只发给若干豆渣填肚子。小丰满的山林被匪六十军霸占砍伐，因而柴价也大涨，滑木柴每斤卖到五、六百元，高粱米和杂面成了公认的奢侈品，豆饼也竟论斤买卖，一千元只能买到一小筒豆渣。在此米珠薪桂下，人民无以为生，市内饿死的人每日就有数十人。许多市民拥到蒋匪省府门前要饭，并已发生抢米风潮。匪军曾企图向解放区抢粮，但仅出城三十里就被人民地方武装击退。
    在解放军包围中走头无路的蒋匪，惊慌不可终日，黄昏后即行戒严，市内枪声彻夜不绝，口令每夜更换七、八次。蒋军士气低落，普遍弥漫着思家厌战情绪。继年前十二月十三日匪六十军军直人力输送团八个士兵杀死排副拖枪起义之后，吉林突击队又有五名士兵，携重机枪一挺向解放军投诚。十二月中蒋匪六十军投诚的士兵达到我东满解放团的就有四十人，其暂五十二师第二团，已由一千七百人跑得只剩了五百人。蒋匪新一军的逃亡，也日益增加，仅该军所辖新三十师九十九团第四连，于去年十二月份半个月内，即曾逃亡四十余人。匪军军官们虽以活埋逃兵的酷刑来镇压，仍毫无效果，士兵们都说：“你们越杀，咱越逃，反正不能跟你们冻死饿死”。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】据外国通讯社十三日沪讯：美帝国主义者为助蒋内战进行走私而设之陈纳德空运大队日前接到“紧急通知”，要该队负责自北平空运军用物资至沈，该队并将与蒋匪订立自沈阳载运七千公务员撤退的合同。据悉：傅作义此次离沈时，其所乘飞机即为企图逃离该城的人所挤满，但除傅匪亲信爪牙外，余均被逐，该市匪帮之惶惧，由此可见一般。
