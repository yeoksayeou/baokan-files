Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 28th: Moscow Dispatch: "Izvestia" published an article entitled "The Victory of Planned Economy in New Democratic Countries," stating that South, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and other countries have basically completed their economic plans for last year. The article points out that the economic levels of new democratic countries are extremely uneven. Therefore, the tasks and goals are not entirely the same, but the implementation of the 1947 plan has three important and consistent results: First, it restored the wounds of war and revived their economies at a pace that Western capitalist countries could not achieve; Second, it eliminated economic and technological backwardness and rapidly moved towards industrialization; Third, it consolidated the economic and political independence of the countries. Poland lost 20 billion U.S. dollars in the war, but last year it produced about 60 million tons of coal, five times that of 1945. Last year, it exported 20 million tons of coal, which is a major contribution to the entire European recovery. Poland's steel industry exceeded pre-war production by 28.2 percent. Power plants exceeded 52 percent. Czechoslovakia took seven years to reach pre-war production levels after World War I, but this time, after the war, despite much greater losses than the previous time, it reached this goal within 30 months. The achievements of the recovery work are reflected in the improvement of the living standards of the masses. The real wages of Czech workers exceeded the 1938 index by 34 percent. Yugoslavia established 448 industrial factories last year, establishing its own steel plants, which is unprecedented in history. Bulgaria's industrial production increased by 67 percent compared to 1939. In Hungary, after stabilizing the currency the year before last, real wages increased by 50 percent compared to the pre-war index, and now it has reached 60 percent. The article concludes that the situation in Western Europe is just the opposite. Along with American "aid" comes economic and political enslavement.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 28th: Compiled from various sources: New democratic countries in Eastern Europe continue to vigorously develop the national economy and continue to achieve significant achievements. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, in view of the successful completion of last year's plan, specially called for "completing the two-year plan ahead of schedule," which was enthusiastically responded to by all workers, launching a new wave of production. As of the 20th of this month, the steel industry has exceeded the plan by 2.3 percent, and the coal mining industry has exceeded it by 1.5 percent. Poland recently passed a new budget案 for 1948, in which expenditures increased by 86 percent compared to last year. According to Polish Minister of Industry and Commerce, Minc, under the new budget案, the planned output of cotton textiles this year will increase by 21.1 percent compared to last year, wool textiles by 25 percent, and leather shoes by 26 percent. Minc also described Poland's current abundant food situation, saying that the sugar industry produced 480,000 tons of sugar last year, an increase of 100,000 tons compared to the previous year. There are currently 600,000 tons of grain in storage, and it is estimated that grain can be self-sufficient this year. The development of animal husbandry can supply all the meat needed by the people. After three years of hard work and construction in Hungary after the war, coal production has recovered to 95 percent of pre-war levels, while steel production has exceeded pre-war levels. State-owned enterprises have developed greatly, and the number of workers employed accounts for two-thirds of the country's workers. Due to the general reduction in prices, workers' real wages have increased by 20 to 25 percent. Last year, foreign trade surprisingly had a surplus of 18 million Hungarian currency. Recently, it also passed the first balanced budget in many years. Romania has recently completed currency reforms to end inflation and improve people's lives. According to the President of the National Bank of Romania, the National Bank currently has enough U.S. dollars to guarantee the country's import plan, and the circulating currency has sufficient gold reserves, making Romania's currency extremely solid. Albania has not only healed the wounds of war, but also successfully completed the economic plan for 1947.

　　东欧各新民主国家计划经济胜利前进
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】莫斯科讯：消息报发表专文，论“新民主国家计划经济的胜利”称：南、波、捷、匈、保等国，已基本上完成去年经济计划。该文指出：新民主国家的经济水平极不平衡。因此，任务和目标也不完全相同，可是一九四七年计划的执行，却有三个重要而一致的结果：第一、恢复了战争的创伤，并以西部资本主义国家办不到的步伐复兴它们的经济；第二、消灭经济和技术的落后，迅速走向工业化；第三、巩固了国家的经济和政治的独立。波兰在战争中损失二百亿美元，可是去年却生产了约六千万吨的煤，五倍于一九四五年，去年输出煤达二千万吨，这对整个欧洲复兴是一个重大的贡献。波兰的钢铁工业超过战前产量的百分之二八点二。动力厂超过百分之五十二。捷克在第一次世界大战后，经过七年才达到战前生产水平，而这次战后，损失虽比前次大得多，却在三十个月内就达到这一目标。复兴工作的成就反映在群众生活水平的提高上，捷克工人的实际工资超过一九三八年指数的百分之三十四。南斯拉夫去年建立了四四八所产业工厂，建立起自己的钢铁厂，这都是历史上空前的。保加利亚工业生产较一九三九年增加了百分之六十七。匈牙利在前年稳定币制后，实际工资较战前指数提高了百分之五十，现在则达到百分之六十。该文结语称：西欧的情形恰好相反，随着美国“援助”以俱来的，是经济与政治上的被奴役。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】综合各方讯：东欧新民主主义各国，继续大力发展国民经济，并不断获得重大之成就。捷克共产党中央委员会鉴于去年计划顺利完成，特号召“提前完成两年计划”，获得全体工人热烈响应，展开了新的生产热潮，至本月二十日止，钢铁工业已超过计划百分之二点三，煤矿工业超过百分之一点五。波兰于日前通过了一九四八年度新预算案，其中岁出较去年增加百分之八十六。据波兰工商部长明兹宣称：在新预算案下，计划今年的棉织品产量较去年将增加百分之廿一点一、毛织品百分之二十五、皮鞋百分之二十六。明兹并叙述波兰目前丰足的食品状况称：制糖工业去年产糖四十八万吨，比前年增加了十万吨，现存谷物六十万吨，估计今年谷物可以自给。畜牧业的发展，可以供给人民所需之全部肉食。匈牙利经战后三年的努力建设，使煤的产量已恢复到战前的百分之九十五，钢的产量则已超过战前水平。国营企业大大发展，雇用之工人已占全国工人的三分之二。由于物价的普遍降低，工人的实际工资已提高了百分之二十至二十五，去年全年对外贸易竟破天荒的出超一千八百万匈币，日前更通过了多年来第一次收支平衡的预算。罗马尼亚近已完成终止通货膨胀与改善人民生活的货币改革，据罗国家银行总理谈称：国家银行现存的美金，足以保证国家的输入计划，流通货币具有充分黄金准备，使罗国的货币极度巩固。阿尔巴尼亚不仅治愈了战争的创伤，而且胜利完成了一九四七年的经济计划。
