[Benbao Jinan Frontline 3rd dispatch] During the liberation of Yuncheng campaign, a certain health department, under the slogan of "All efforts to serve the wounded," had more than 40 people volunteer to donate blood, totaling 1800 CC. During the blood transfusions, the director, doctors, and support staff actively participated. The cook, Li Tingsheng, who was in poor health, also volunteered to donate 200 CC of blood. Others advised him to donate less, but he said, "People on the front lines are shedding so much blood, what is donating this little bit? As long as we can cure the wounded and increase the fighting power of our troops to quickly take Yuncheng, it's worth it." Doctor Huang saw a wounded soldier who had just come from the front line, unconscious due to excessive blood loss. He immediately drew 110 CC of blood from himself and transfused it into the wounded soldier. By the time he left the operating table, the wounded soldier was able to speak. Deputy Director Fu himself donated blood and worked for a day and a night without rest.

　　某卫生处在运城战役中
  　争给伤员输血
    【本报晋南前线三日电】解放运城战役中，某卫生处在“一切力量为伤员服务”的口号下，有四十余人自报输血，共输血一千八百ＣＣ。在输血当中，处长、医生、杂务人员踊跃参加。炊事员李廷声身体不好，也自报输血二百ＣＣ，别人劝他少报些，他说：“人家在前方打仗流了那多么的血，咱输这一点算啥？只要能把彩号治好，增加咱们部队的战斗力快把运城拿下来就行。”黄医生看见一个刚从前线下来的彩号，因流血过多昏迷不醒，他就首先从自己身上抽出一百一十ＣＣ血，输到彩号身上，等到下手术台时，这位彩号就会说话了。付处长自己输了血还工作了一天一夜没有休息。
