Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan, January 17th: After the People's Liberation Army entered the Jianghan area, they immediately opened granaries to help the poor and sent a large number of cadres to various places to assist farmers in widely carrying out the land distribution movement. In the past month, twelve democratic county governments have been established in Jingshan, Zhongxiang, Qianjiang, Tianmen, Jianli, Jingmen, Anlu, Yingcheng, Jiangling, Hongshan, Mianyang, and Suixian.
