Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 9th: New York dispatch: Labor unrest in the United States continues to escalate. The strike by Local 16 of the Chicago Printing Union, affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, has persisted for six weeks. This strike, involving 1,600 workers, continues to force Chicago's six major newspapers to maintain publication via mimeograph. The strike by the Transport Workers Union, affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), also erupted simultaneously in New York, Washington, and San Francisco on the 2nd, involving more than 3,500 workers. This included workers from the four major telegraph and telephone companies, thereby "cutting off two-thirds of America's commercial telecommunications with overseas" (Associated Press). The reason for the strike was the employers' rejection of the union's demand for a 30% wage increase in the face of rising prices, and even their counter-proposal of increasing the work week by five hours without increasing wages, a barbaric demand. According to the union, the strike will continue thoroughly. Simultaneously, 1,500 workers from the Government Employees Cafeteria Union, affiliated with the CIO, began a strike on the 5th due to failure to achieve their demand for a wage increase. This action made it difficult for 80,000 government employees who eat in 42 cafeterias to get meals. According to a Washington dispatch, the US Department of Labor released its full-year strike statistics for 1947 in July: Last year, the United States lost 35 million workdays due to worker strikes, with 3,600 strikes occurring.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 9th: San Francisco dispatch: Harry Bridges, president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) affiliated with the CIO, wrote in the union's newspaper, "The Dispatcher," on the 27th of last month that his union is considering refusing to load cargo to certain countries, launching a movement similar to the strike the union launched in 1938 and the refusal to ship scrap iron to Japan in 1939. Bridges also stated that the CIO Executive Board is considering the problem that, within the next month, overseas workers will increasingly demand that our dockworkers "refuse to load arms and materials onto American or foreign ships, which will be used against workers in other countries, to undermine worker strikes, and to disintegrate the struggles of workers against reactionary employers, landlords, and governments."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 9th: According to TASS, New York dispatch: The movement among prominent American social figures against the reactionary policies of the United States in the Far East is growing. Former MacArthur advisor Bisson, W.E.B. Du Bois, leader of the NAACP, and New York Senator Isaacs, among others, have initiated a national conference to be held on the 23rd of this month to discuss plans to counter the current reactionary Far East policies of the United States, and to formulate an outline for a democratic Far East policy. The initiators of the conference, in a statement, condemned the reactionary policies of the United States in China, Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea.

　　反对资本家野蛮剥削
  　美国工人到处罢工
    【新华社陕北九日电】纽约讯：美国工潮激荡不已，劳联所属之芝加哥印刷工会第十六分会的罢工，已坚持六周之久，这个一千六百人的罢工，现仍迫使芝加哥六大报馆不得不以油印维持出报。产联所属之交通工人工会的罢工，亦于二日在纽约、华盛顿、旧金山同时爆发，参加罢工工人达三千五百余人。内包括四大电报、电话公司的工人，从而“切断了美国与海外商业电讯交通的三分之二”（合众社）。罢工原因为资方拒绝工会提出的在物价高涨下增资百分之三十的要求，甚至反提出每周增加工作五小时而不增加工资的野蛮要求。据工会方面表示，罢工将彻底进行。同时，产联所属的政府职员食堂工会工人一千五百人，因要求增加工资未达目的，又于五日开始罢工。此举使在四十二家食堂吃饭的八万政府职员吃饭为难。另据华盛顿讯：美劳工部七月发表的四七年度全年罢工统计：美去年由于工人罢工而损失的工作日达三千五百万个，罢工次数为三千六百次。
    【新华社陕北九日电】旧金山讯：产联的国际码头仓库工人工会主席布利治，上月二十七日在该工会机关报“快讯报”著文称：他的工会正考虑拒绝装货至某些国家，展开类似该工会于三八年发动的罢工及三九年的拒绝装运废铁至日本的运动。布氏又称：产联执行局考虑到一个问题，即在下个月内，海外工人将日渐要求我们码头工人“拒绝替美国船只或外国船只装运军火和物资，而这些军火和物资是用来反对其他各国工人，破坏工人罢工，瓦解工人为反对反动雇主、地主及政府的斗争的”。
    【新华社陕北九日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：美国著名社会人士反对美国在远东反动政策的运动，正在增长。前麦克阿瑟顾问毕生、“全国有色人种协进会”领袖黑人杜波斯、纽约参议员伊萨克斯等人，发起于本月二十三日召开一全国会议，讨论对付美现行反动远东政策的计划，并拟制一个民主的远东政策大纲。该会发起人在声明中，谴责美国在中国、日本、菲律滨及南韩的反动政策。
