Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th - A reporter from this agency reports on the achievements of the Inner Mongolia Self-Defense Army over the past year: Over the past year, the Inner Mongolia Self-Defense Army has fought alongside the Northeast People's Liberation Army, and according to incomplete statistics, a total of 8,758 enemy troops have been annihilated, including the capture of a Major General Staff Officer, a puppet Tongliao County Magistrate, and two Banner Security Detachment Commanders. The captured spoils included 4 artillery pieces, 50 light and heavy machine guns, 2,658 long and short guns, more than 200,000 rounds of ammunition, 6,750 war horses, and many other military supplies. One enemy plane was shot down, and 93 strongholds were recovered. In all battles, the Self-Defense Army units demonstrated the valiant fighting traditions of the Mongolian people. In a battle against an enemy security brigade in May last year, a unit of the Jerim League Frontline Self-Defense Army created a glorious record of zero casualties versus 320 enemy casualties. In July last year, another unit completely routed the entire 3rd Division of the enemy's newly formed 1st Cavalry Army in three consecutive battles, killing 120 enemy soldiers including a regimental commander and capturing 534 enemy soldiers including regimental commanders Li Kuangmin and Li Xianba. During the Autumn Offensive, the unit's cavalry breached the Beining Railway three times, completely demolishing more than 20 miles of railway tracks in six hours. Over the past year, the Self-Defense Army has also cooperated with the Chahar Iron Cavalry, operating behind enemy lines, smashing Fu bandit's large-scale "mopping-up" operations in June and July, suppressing the Fu bandit's collusion with Inner Mongolian reactionaries to plot rebellion, and annihilating the Fu bandit forces in Habaga, a northern key town of Baoyuan, three times. They also completely annihilated the Fu bandit forces east of Xianghuang Banner of Chahar and East Sonid. The Shangdu and Huade armed work teams persisted in and opened up a vast guerrilla area of approximately 2,000 square miles, 400 miles long and 50 miles wide, north of Shangdu, Huade, Kangbao, and Baoyuan, controlling key military locations such as Maodu north of Shangdu, Liuzhijian north of Huade, Zhanggaixue north of Kangbao, and Habaga north of Baoyuan. A certain Inner Mongolian cavalry unit, galloping through the Bayantala and Ulanqab leagues, contained the defense forces of seven counties of Fu bandit, and successively destroyed 42 puppet regimes, restoring a vast area of eastern and western 500 miles, north and south 300 miles, with a population of hundreds of thousands in the two leagues. At present, all areas of the Halun and Xilingol leagues and most areas of the Bayantala and Ulanqab leagues have been liberated.
