Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 15th: Reports from various sources: The agent of U.S. monopoly capital, the American Federation of Labor (AFL), has recently encountered unanimous rejection from workers' organizations in South America in its actions to split the unity of Latin American workers. The latter pointed out the inevitable failure of this attempt. It is reported that labor confederations in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Venezuela have all refused to attend the so-called "Pan-American Workers' Conference" convened by the AFL in Lima, the capital of Peru, on the 10th. Peruvian workers held a powerful demonstration outside the venue when the conference opened. So far, only a small number of representatives from small trade union organizations bought off by the AFL have attended the conference. Nirega, vice chairman of the Argentine National Labor Confederation, stated when announcing the Confederation's refusal to participate that the conference convened by the AFL was an attempt to establish an anti-communist front to clear obstacles in the path of U.S. monopoly capitalism. Toledo, president of the Latin American Labor Confederation, also issued a statement condemning the AFL for doing everything possible to make the people of Latin American countries serve U.S. monopoly capital. However, Toledo emphasized that the AFL's shameful attempt would inevitably fail because "the Latin American Labor Confederation is unprecedentedly strong."

The Soviet Trade Union's organ, "Labor Newspaper," commented on the Lima conference, stating that the purpose of this conference was to establish a new "Pan-American Labor Alliance" to counter the existing Latin American Labor Confederation, which is striving to break away from the oppression of foreign capital. It also stated that the U.S. rulers are using their agents to bribe trade union corrupt elements to buy off those in the trade unions who are prepared to sell out the interests of the working class, and the AFL has set aside two million U.S. dollars for this purpose. However, the newspaper believes that the AFL's attempt to split the workers' movement, like previous attempts that have failed, will inevitably go bankrupt.

　　南美劳工联盟强大
  　美国想分裂它碰了钉子
    【新华社陕北十五日电】各方讯：美国独占资本的代理人——美国劳工联合会，最近分裂拉丁美洲工人团结的行动，遭到南美各国工人组织的一致唾弃，后者并指出此企图的必然失败。据悉，阿根廷、巴西、乌拉圭、玻利维亚、巴拉圭及委内瑞拉等国的劳工联盟，均已拒绝出席美劳联十日在秘鲁首都里马所召集的所谓“泛美职工大会”，秘鲁工人并在该会开幕时，在会场门外举行强大的示威。迄今出席该会者仅有一小撮为劳联所收买的小职工会组织的代表。阿根廷全国劳工联盟副主席尼勒加，在宣布该联盟拒绝与会时称：美国劳联所召开的这一会议，是企图建立反共阵线，以扫清美独占资本主义道路上的障碍。拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席托列达诺亦发表声明，谴责美劳联千方百计使拉丁美洲各国人民为美国独占资本服务。但托氏强调：美国劳联这一可耻企图，必然失败，因为“拉丁美洲劳工联盟已空前的强大了”。
    苏联职工会机关报“劳动报”在评论里马会议时指出：这个会议的目的，在于建立一个新的“泛美劳工联盟，以对抗现存的并努力为摆脱外国资本压迫而奋斗的拉丁美洲劳工联盟。又称：美国统治者正利用其代理人以贿赂职工会腐化分子的方法，来收买职工会中准备出卖工人阶级利益的分子，劳联已为此拿出了二百万美元。但该报认为，美国劳联这一分裂工人运动的企图，正如以前的企图之失败一样，必将趋于破产。
