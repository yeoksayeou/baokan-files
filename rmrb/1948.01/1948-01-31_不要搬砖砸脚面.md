Since the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the Border Region Government has successively promulgated regulations for punishing those who sabotage land reform, and this newspaper has repeatedly pointed out that the Land Law should be seriously publicized and implemented. In some places, very good publicity and explanations have been given to the masses. The poor and hired peasants are very happy, the middle peasants are also very settled, and everyone is united in production, studying how to divide the land equally, which is very good. However, in many places, patient publicity and explanation were not carried out. In some places, there were even distortions, so that the poor and hired peasants did not truly grasp this weapon, the middle peasants showed panic, and the landlords, rich peasants, and some bad cadres secretly sabotaged... These are all unacceptable phenomena.

The basic spirit of the Land Law Outline is to eliminate feudal and semi-feudal land systems and fully satisfy the demands of the poor and hired peasants. Now that the poor and hired peasants are happy, this is very natural. Today, we should patiently and repeatedly publicize and explain to them, dispel their various concerns, and inspire them to become conscious and completely turn themselves around.

The basic spirit of the Land Law Outline is to simultaneously consolidate the unity of all middle peasants. The middle peasants will benefit from the equal distribution movement and will not suffer losses. Some middle peasants will receive land and movable property, some middle peasants will neither contribute nor receive, and only some wealthy middle peasants will take out some surplus land, which will still be done through consultation. Movable property will not be touched at all. Thoroughly eliminating feudalism, overthrowing the landlords who oppressed the middle peasants in the past, and then being able to produce with peace of mind and develop their families freely, the middle peasants should fully support the Land Law. However, some middle peasants have mistakenly believed the rumors, making them suspect that equal distribution of land is "collectivization," so they are not at ease with production and instead indulge in excessive eating and drinking, wasting property. This is actually "lifting a brick to drop it on your own foot." The property is your own. If you waste it today, you will regret it in the future. You should immediately stop doing such stupid things.

The Land Law Outline stipulates that landlords should also be given an equal share. It is good that some landlords are happy to hear this. However, giving him a share is after he has taken out all his property and bowed his head to the peasants. In the past, he oppressed and exploited the peasants. Today, the peasants give him a share, so that he can seek a living through labor. This is the peasants' magnanimity towards him. Therefore, the landlords should honestly wait for the equal distribution and await disposal. Some stubborn elements even want to make trouble, spread rumors, sell property... This is a crime and must be resolutely stopped. If they continue to be stubborn, the peasants will deal with them.

It is a pity that a few district and village cadres in the past occupied more fruits and made mistakes. Hearing the Land Law Outline, instead of considering how to admit their mistakes to the peasants, return the over-gained fruits, repent, and seek the understanding of the peasants, they adopted the method of continuing to make mistakes, such as not letting the peasants know the Land Law Outline, selling and concealing the over-gained fruits, indulging in excessive eating and drinking, and even scaring the peasants and provoking the unity of the peasants... They think they are very clever, but in fact they are very stupid. The peasants know everything they do. If they sell the fruits today, they will have to return them tomorrow. If they have already wasted what they have received, they will no longer be given a share in the future. They have done stupid things themselves, and they will still suffer the loss themselves. They should know that these behaviors are crimes. Knowing it and deliberately committing it, making mistakes on top of mistakes, it will be even more difficult to seek the understanding of the peasants. We once again advise these people to think more clearly. Only by knowing and correcting mistakes is the best way out!

　　不要搬砖砸脚面
    土地法大纲公布后，边区政府接着颁布了破坏土地改革治罪条例，本报也屡次指出，应该认真宣传、执行土地法。有些地方，向群众作了很好的宣传解释，贫雇非常高兴，中农也很安心，大家团结生产，研究如何平分，这是很好的。但也有不少地方，没有进行耐心的宣传解释，有的地方还发生了曲解，以致贫雇没有真正掌握了这个武器，中农表现恐慌，地主富农和某些坏干部暗地破坏……这些都是不能允许的现象。
    土地法大纲的基本精神是消灭封建与半封建的土地制度，充分满足贫雇农的要求。现在贫雇高兴，这是很自然的。今天应该向他们耐心反复的宣传解释，解除他们的各种顾虑，启发他们自觉起来，彻底翻过身来。
    土地法大纲的基本精神是同时必须巩固的团结全体中农。中农在平分运动中会得到好处，不会受到损失。一部分中农要分进土地和浮财，一部分中农不出不入，只有一部分富裕中农拿出些多余的土地，还是商量着办，浮财是完全不动的。彻底消灭封建，把过去压迫中农的地主打倒，以后可以安心生产，放手发家，中农应该完全拥护土地法。但是有些中农误信了谣言，使他们怀疑平分土地是“归伙”，于是不安心生产，反而大吃二喝，浪费财产，这其实是“拿起砖头砸自己的脚”。财产是你自己的，今天浪费了，将来会后悔，应该立刻停止干这种傻事。
    土地法大纲规定分给地主同样一份。有些地主听了高兴，这也是好的。但是，给他一份是在他把全部财产都拿出来，并且向农民低了头以后。过去他压迫剥削农民，今天农民给他一份，使他从劳动中求生活，这是农民对他的宽大。所以地主应该老老实实等待平分，听候处理。竟有些执迷不悟的东西，听说平分，想闹一闹，制造谣言，变卖财产……这是犯了罪，要坚决制止。再执迷不悟，农民会对付他们的。
    可惜的是有少数区村干部过去多占了果实，犯了错误，听到土地法大纲，不是考虑如何向农民承认错误，退出多得果实，痛改前非，求得农民的谅解。而是采取了继续犯错误的方法，如不让农民知道土地法大纲，变卖与隐蔽多得果实，大吃二喝，甚至吓唬农民，挑拨农民的团结……他自己以为很聪明，其实是很傻的。他的事情农民都知道。今天变卖了果实，明天还得退出来。已经拿到的浪费了，将来不再分给他。自己办了糊涂事，吃亏的还是自己。要知道这些行为是犯罪的，明知故犯，错上加错，就更难求得农民的谅解了。我们再一次劝告这些人，还是想明白些。只有知过就改，才是最好的出路！
