Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Prague dispatch: Premier Gottwald of Czechoslovakia delivered a New Year's broadcast speech, extensively discussing the achievements of the national economy last year, stating that by the end of 1947, Czechoslovak industrial production had reached the pre-war level of 1937. Gottwald pointed out: Last year's severe drought (grain harvest only reached 63% of the planned target) was a serious test for the new democratic regime, but "we have won trust" because the new democratic regime and the generous assistance from the Soviet Union and new democratic countries guaranteed the supply to the people. After condemning the reactionary forces' sabotage activities using economic difficulties, Gottwald announced: "1948 will be a happy year for our industry and consumers, and a bleak year for speculators and saboteurs. We must do everything possible to improve the people's living standards and implement the land reform that our farmers are eagerly awaiting. To solve these problems, we must unite all progressive forces, purge the reactionary elements from the republic, and consolidate our national front." Finally, Gottwald asserted: "This year's election will represent the legitimate aspirations of the working people and bring complete failure to the reactionary forces. This year will be a year of further consolidation of our state-owned economy and democratic regime." Furthermore, according to the Czechoslovak Planning Commission, all major industries in Czechoslovakia have completed the 1947 plan. The value of the fourth quarter's output was 60 billion crowns (equivalent to 1.2 billion US dollars), compared to 51.1 billion crowns in the same period of the previous year. After the First World War, it took Czechoslovakia as long as ten years to reach the pre-war industrial level, while after the Second World War, it reached the pre-war level within two years, which is a great victory.

　　捷克国民经济发展工业赶上战前水平
    总理宣布今年实行土地改革
    【新华社陕北十日电】布拉格讯：捷总理哥特瓦尔德于新年发表广播演说，纵谈去年国民经济的成就称：到一九四七年年底，捷工业生产已达到战前一九三七年水平。哥氏指出：去年严重的旱灾（谷物收获只达原定计划的百分之六十三），是对新民主政权的一个严重考验，但“我们已赢得了信任”，因为新民主政权和苏联及新民主国家的慷慨援助，保证了对人民的供应。哥氏在痛斥反动势力利用经济困难所进行的破坏活动后，宣布：“一九四八年对于我国工业和消费者将是快乐的一年，而对于投机商人和破坏者则将是黯淡的一年。我们必须竭尽所能，努力改善人民生活水准，并实行我国农民热切期待着的土地改革。为了解决这些问题，我们必须团结一切进步力量，清洗共和国的反动分子，巩固我们的民族阵线。”最后，哥氏断言：“今年的选举将表示劳动人民的正当愿望，并带给反动势力以完全失败。今年一年将是我们的国有经济和民主政权获得进一步巩固的一年。”又据捷计划委员会公布：捷各主要工业已完成一九四七年计划。第四季的出产品价值六百亿克罗那（等于十二亿美元），前年的同一时期为五百十一亿克罗那。第一次世界大战后，捷克曾费时十年之久，才达到战前工业水平，而在第二次世界大战后，两年之内就达到战前水平，这是一个伟大的胜利。
