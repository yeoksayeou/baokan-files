　　Cadres Must Be Honest About Their Mistakes
  　Critique of "Labor-Capital Cooperation" in Mapingtou, Jincheng
    ·Zhao Shuli·
    On the thirteenth of this month, the People's Daily published a news item on the front page about the implementation of "Labor-Capital Cooperation" in Mapingtou Village, Jincheng, and pointed out that it was a grave error to consider the relationship between middle peasants and poor peasants as one between those selling labor and capitalists.

    In addition to agreeing with the pointing out of this error, I feel that we should also trace it to its roots. The news item states that out of a total of one hundred and twenty-six households in the village, twenty-five are poor peasants, most of whom only have enough grain to eat for one month, which shows that they are extremely poor. In order to solve their difficulties, the entire village held a three-day conference, straightened out the thinking of the middle peasants, and then came up with this "Labor-Capital Cooperation." Since the facts are like this, then we must ask: How was the "filling the gaps and making up the differences" movement carried out in Mapingtou Village over the past year? There are quite a few landlords and rich peasants in Mapingtou, have they been thoroughly struggled against? If they haven't been thoroughly struggled against, why not? If they have been thoroughly struggled against, to whom have the fruits been distributed? Why is it that even now, extremely poor households still account for one-fifth of the village? Why do these one-fifth of the households not have the qualifications to turn over and stand up, and even now can only engage in "Labor-Capital Cooperation" with the middle peasants? Is this the result of "filling the gaps and making up the differences"?

    If the work of "filling the gaps and making up the differences" over the past year has not been done well, the village cadres should take responsibility, and cannot push the twenty-five holes to the middle peasants to fill. If all the landlords and rich peasants in the village have been thoroughly struggled against, and the poor peasants have all turned over and become middle peasants, and the remaining twenty-five extremely poor families are all village cadres, then naturally the masses can be mobilized to fill the gaps; if these twenty-five families are all from the masses, and the village cadres have either relaxed their grip on the landlords and rich peasants, or occupied too much of the fruits themselves, or distributed the fruits to another part of the people and forgot about these twenty-five families, then it cannot be said that the middle peasants and these twenty-five families can just engage in "Labor-Capital Cooperation" to call it quits.

    Fortunately, the Land Law has been promulgated, and acting in accordance with the law can correct this error. How to do it, and who will do it, are stipulated in the Land Law. Poor peasants do not need to worry: in the future, when the Poor Peasants Association is organized, they will be the legal land distributors themselves, and will no longer have to fear being delayed by others. Middle peasants do not need to worry: acting in accordance with the Land Law, middle peasants will not be moved like anything -- those whose land is above the average will only take out a little land, those below the average will have to get a little land, and the floating wealth will not be touched at all, and they can also participate in the Peasants Association and become legal land distributors, and you will never be asked to take out things to engage in "Labor-Capital Cooperation" again. Village cadres, as long as they are not landlords and rich peasants who have taken advantage of the revolution, even if they have made some mistakes, as long as they are honest, they do not need to worry: those who have occupied too much of the fruits, as long as they honestly return them in accordance with the supplementary measures of the Land Law, will be fine; those who have relaxed their grip on the landlords and rich peasants, or have not taken comprehensive care of the distribution of fruits, in the future, the people who implement the Land Law will correct these mistakes for you, and will no longer pursue your responsibility. However, this requires you to be truly honest, and if you did not do a good job in "filling the gaps and making up the differences," and now you want to play some tricks in implementing the Land Law to resist, then you have committed a crime and will be sent to the People's Court to be punished.

### 干部有错要老实　评晋城马坪头“劳资合作”

　　干部有错要老实
  　评晋城马坪头“劳资合作”
    ·赵树理·
    本月十三日，人民日报第一版登出晋城马坪头村实行“劳资合作”的消息，并且指出他把中农与贫雇的关系，算成出卖劳力的人与资本家的关系，是十分错误的。
    我除同意指出这个错误以外，觉着还该追一追根。这消息里边说全村共一百二十六户，就有二十五户是贫雇，这二十五户，大部分只有能吃一个月的粮食，可见还是赤贫。为着给他们解决困难，全村开了三天大会，打通了一回中农思想，才弄成这个“劳资合作”。事实既是这样，那就要问：一年多的填平补齐运动，马坪头村是怎样做的？马坪头的地主富农并不算少，究竟斗透了没有？要是没有斗透为什么不斗？要是斗透了，果实都分给什么人了？为什么直到如今，赤贫户还占全村五分之一？为什么这五分之一的户口，没有翻身资格，直到如今还只能去和中农“劳资合作”？填平补齐的成绩就是这个吗？
    这一年多的填平补齐工作没有作好，村干部应该负责，不能把二十五个窟窿推给中农去填。要是全村的地主富农都斗透了，贫雇都翻了身成了中农，余下的二十五家赤贫尽是些村干部，那自然可以发动群众来填补填补；要是这二十五家尽是群众，村干部或是放松了地主富农，或是自己多占了果实，或是把果实分给另一部分人忘了这二十五家，那就都不能叫中农和这二十五家来“劳资合作”一下算拉倒。
    好在土地法公布出来了，照法办事，就可以纠正了这种错误。怎样做，谁来做，土地法上都有规定。赤贫户不用担心：将来组织贫农团，自己就是合法的分地人，再不要怕被别人耽搁了自己。中农不要担心：照土地法办事，中农跟不动一样——土地在平均数以上的只拿出一点地，在平均数以下的还要得一点地，浮财一点也不动，并且还能参加农会，当合法的分地人，绝不会再叫你拿出东西来搞“劳资合作”。村干部只要不是地主富农钻了革命的空子，虽然出了些错误，只要老实，也用不着担心：多占了果实的，只要照土地法补充办法老老实实退出来，就没了事；放松了地主富农的，或分果实没有照顾到全面的，将来执行土地法的人，会替你把这些错误改正了，也不再追究你的责任。不过这就得你真正老实，要是在填平补齐时候既然没把工作做好，到现在执行土地法又想捣点什么鬼，来抵抗抵抗，那就是犯了罪，就要送到人民法庭去受处分。
