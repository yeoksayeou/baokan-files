　　Before and After the Liberation of Luohe
    Mu Xin, Feng Mu
    At the cost of only a little over a dozen light injuries, the People's Liberation Army liberated Luohe, a famous commercial center on the Pinghan Railway, the first inland river port in central Henan, with a population of 150,000, and a modernized city, in just two or three hours.

    On the afternoon of the 18th of last month, our army, braving the bitter cold after the snow, pointed its spearhead at Yancheng. But just as the enemy was preparing to fight, a crack unit of our army unexpectedly and swiftly crossed the Ru River in secret, advancing in a roundabout way from the east and casting a dragnet over Luohe, five miles southeast of Yancheng. Late at night, the enemy guarding Yancheng was still staring wide-eyed waiting for battle; the enemy guarding Luohe still thought that disaster would not befall them and were peacefully playing mahjong. Meanwhile, the assault troops of the People's Liberation Army had already divided into several routes and went straight into the enemy's heart from the East Gate, the railway station, and the South Gate of Luohe. At this time, the enemy had not yet noticed, and a soldier came to the street to deliver a letter and was captured by our army. He was a prisoner of war who had been released by our army not long ago. After talking with him, he immediately led our army to the location of their troops. At this time, an enemy company commander came out to inspect the sentry post and was also captured by us. Our platoon leader, Li Zhihua, said to him: "Go inside and blow the assembly whistle and tell them to come out and line up." The enemy company commander immediately went in and blew the whistle to form a line. More than 300 enemies were thus captured by our two squads without firing a single shot.

    Before dawn, the East Gate, the railway station, the South Gate, and other places were occupied by our army without any casualties. At this time, the enemy in the inner city realized that the situation was not good, but it was already too late. Subsequently, our attacking troops poured into the inner city from the south and east. The defending enemy scattered like sheep, but none of them could escape the ever-shrinking dragnet. The three crack companies entrenched in the four courtyards, although trying to resist and struggle, were all crushed one by one. This city, twenty miles in circumference, was completely liberated under the bright sunshine of early morning. After detailed investigation, we only sacrificed two people and wounded eighteen, while the number of enemies captured was, according to incomplete statistics, more than 2,800.

    This reporter drove into Luohe on the night of the 19th and was greeted by a long line of prisoners stretching from one street to another. Cars sped back and forth on the wide roads. The railway station was brightly lit, and the noise was a symphony of shouting and the sound of metal. Dozens of train carriages were parked there. The materials we seized were piled up like mountains, including hundreds of thousands of pairs of shoes and 150,000 pairs of American-made goggles. Groups of people were flocking to the railway station to collect rice and flour, including workers, small vendors, merchants, students, as well as wounded soldiers and officers abandoned by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

    Most of the city's 5,000 large and small shops have begun to operate, and the three theaters have also begun to perform. The streets and alleys are filled with crowds welcoming the People's Liberation Army. All kinds of declarations of the People's Liberation Army and the Outline Land Law are crowded with people reading them. No trace of war can be found.

    People collecting grain in front of several large warehouses in the city are also coming and going in an endless stream. More than 40,000 poor people in the city who have no food or clothing are busy collecting relief grain. On Zhongshan Road, some disabled beggars each have piles of food and clothing given to them by passing PLA soldiers. A soldier gently covered a blind old woman with a bed quilt and put seized canned beef in her basket. Another soldier picked up the child beside her and put on him an oversized cotton coat… At the South Gate, the car of a certain general was stopped by several Chiang Kai-shek army officers who requested to join the People's Liberation Army, followed by a small businessman who also came over to request to join the army.

    The enemy in Yancheng, five miles away across the Ru River, was shrinking back and not moving at this time. Although there were still a few sparse gunshots from time to time, the people of Luohe, under the protection of the People's Liberation Army, had begun to live new and happy days.

　　漯河解放前后
    穆欣、冯牧
    解放军以十余人轻伤的代价，在短短两三个钟头内解放了漯河。它是平汉路上著名的商业中心，豫中第一个水旱码头，拥有十五万人口，是一座近代化了的城市。
    上月十八日下午我军冒着雪后的严寒，锋刃指向郾城。但正当敌人准备应战的时候，我某部精锐兵团却出敌意料的秘密和神速的渡过汝河，从东面迂回前进，给郾城东南五里的漯河撒下了天罗地网。深夜，郾城守敌还瞪着眼睛等待战斗；漯河守敌还以为厄运轮不到他们头上，安心的打着麻将。而解放军的突击部队已经分成几路从漯河的东关、车站及南关直入敌人的腹心。这时敌人尚未发觉，一个兵士到街上来送信，被我军捉住了。他是一个不久前才被我军释放的俘虏，接谈之后，立即带领我军到了他们部队的驻地。此时，一个敌军队长出来查哨也被我捉着了，我李之华排长对他说：“你到里面吹集合哨，叫他们出来站队”。敌军队长立刻进去吹哨站队，三百多敌人便胡胡涂涂的被我两班人不发一枪的俘虏了。
    拂晓之前，东关、车站、南关等都被我军毫无伤亡的占领了。这时内城的敌人才发觉情况不好，然而已经晚了。随着，我攻击部队就从南面、东面涌进了内城。守敌象羊群般逃散，但一个也跑不出逐渐缩小的天罗地网。据守在四个院里的三个精锐连虽图抵抗挣扎，都被一一粉碎。这座方圆二十里的城市就在清早明朗的阳光下完全获得了解放。经过详细调查，我仅牺牲两人，受伤十八人，而俘虏敌人仅据不完全统计就有二千八百多人。
    记者于十九日夜乘车驶进漯河，迎面碰见漫长的俘虏行列由这条街拖到另一条街。在宽阔的马路上，汽车穿梭的飞驰着。车站上灯火辉煌，喧嚷声与钢铁器响声交响成一片。数十列车箱停在那里。我缴获的物资堆积如山，鞋子有数十万双，美造风镜有十五万付。成群结队的人民，在涌向车站领米面。其中有工人、小贩商民、学生及被蒋匪遗弃的伤兵和军官。
    市内五千家大小商店已大半开始营业，三家戏院也开始演唱。街头巷尾到处站满欢迎解放军的人群。解放军的各种宣言及土地法大纲前挤满了人在看。再找不到战争痕迹了。
    城里几个大仓库前领粮的人也穿梭不绝。全市有四万多无衣无食的穷人都在忙着领救济粮。中山路上有些残废的乞丐，每个人面前也都堆满了过路解放军战士给他们的食品和衣物。一个战士把床棉被轻轻的盖在一个瞎子老太婆的身上，并把缴获的牛肉罐头放在她筐子里，另一个战士抱起她身旁的小孩，替他穿上一件又大又长的棉衣………。在南门口某将军乘坐的汽车被几个蒋军编余军官拦住，请求参加解放军，接着有一个小商人也过来，请求参军。
    相距五里汝河对岸的郾城敌人，这时龟缩不动，虽时而还传来几声稀疏的炮声，但是漯河人民在人民解放军的拱卫下，已开始过着新的欢乐的日子。
