Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 14th: Comprehensive news: In order to cope with the soaring prices in Shanghai, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities have implemented even more terrifying measures. Chiang's secret agents have arrested more than 200 merchants on the 9th and 10th, confiscating hundreds of billions of yuan in gold and US dollars. However, they still cannot control the Shanghai market. As of the 10th, the price of rice had reached 1.6 million yuan per stone, and rice merchants were only selling to regular customers. Black market merchants dealing in US dollars and gold have all gone underground. Most merchants refuse to sell goods, saying: Gold, currency, and prices will rise even more sharply before the Lunar New Year. A news agency believes that the price surge caused by the Chiang government's issuance of large banknotes this time is more fierce than that caused by the "gold rush" in February last year. Since the Chiang government announced the issuance of large banknotes on the 9th of last month, the price surge has rapidly spread to major cities in all Chiang-controlled areas. In addition to Shanghai, Tianjin, the economic center of the Chiang bandits in North China, also experienced market chaos after the news of the banknote issuance. On the 10th of last month, the prices of daily necessities such as rice, flour, and cooking oil rose by 20% in one day. By the 13th, rice had risen to 1.35 million yuan, and "Warship Brand" flour had risen to over 700,000 yuan, an increase of more than 37%. Corn rose from 5,500 yuan to 7,500 yuan per catty, and corn flour also rose to 7,000 yuan per catty. The lives of the broad working people are severely threatened. On the 15th, four corpses were found in Tianjin due to freezing and starvation. The streets are full of poor people holding small "help" notes. The family members of a rickshaw puller said: "A few days ago, when corn flour was selling for 3,000, we were not willing to come out to ask for help (referring to begging), but now it is really impossible." In Peiping on the 10th of last month, although the large banknotes had not yet arrived, all goods had already shown a "red everywhere" price surge, so that a responsible person of the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Peiping Pacification Headquarters also confessed: "The soaring prices are not a local problem, and it is difficult to talk about any countermeasures."

　　蒋匪发行十万元大票
  　蒋区物价普遍暴涨
    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合消息：为对付上海物价暴涨，蒋匪当局已实行更恐怖之手段，蒋特于九、十两日内先后逮捕商人二百余人，并没收黄金美钞达数百亿元。但仍不能控制上海市场。至十日止大米价格每石曾高达一百六十万元，且米商仅对老主顾出售。美钞黄金黑市商人则均转入地下。大多数商人拒绝出售商品，他们说：旧历年前金钞及物价更将大涨特涨。此次蒋政府发行大钞所引起的物价猛涨，某通讯社认为较去年二月“黄金潮”所引起者更为凶猛。自上月九日蒋政府宣布十日发行大钞后，涨风即迅速波及全蒋管区各大城市。除上海外，华北蒋匪经济中心天津，发钞消息传到后，市场亦顿形混乱，上月十日，一日中大米、面粉、食油等各种日用必需品，即上涨百分之二十，至十三日大米已涨至一百三十五万元。兵船牌面粉涨至七十万元以上，涨百分之三十七强。玉米由每斤五千五百元涨至七千五百元，玉米面亦涨到七千元一斤。广大劳动人民生活受到严重威胁，十五日一日内，津市即发现因冻饿而死之尸首四具。街上到处是手持“求助”小条的穷人，某三轮车夫的家属说：“前几天玉米面卖到三千时还不肯出来求人（指讨乞），现在实在不成了”。北平于上月十日，虽大钞尚未运到，各物即已呈满堂红之暴涨，以致蒋匪北平行辕某负责人亦自供：“物价暴涨非局部问题，难谈有何对策。”
