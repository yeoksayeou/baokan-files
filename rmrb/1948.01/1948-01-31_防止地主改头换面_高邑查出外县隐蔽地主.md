　　Prevent Landlords from Disguising Themselves
　　Gaoyi Uncovers Hidden Landlords from Other Counties
　　[Gaoyi News] In Xiguan of this county, there is a household from Fangdeng Village, Lincheng County, named Zhang Shenyan. Before the incident, his family owned more than 90 mu of land, making him the second-largest landlord in the village. After the incident, Fangdeng Village became a guerrilla zone. The Anti-Japanese government led the people in implementing rent and interest reduction. To avoid being liquidated by the masses, Zhang Shenyan sold more than 40 mu of land and moved his entire family to Xiguan Village in this county in 1942, where they earned a living by grinding flour. Later, they opened a grain shop. After liberation in 1944, in order to conceal his landlord identity, he pretended to be proactive and posed as a poor peasant, and during mass movements, he was allocated houses, land, livestock, and other fruits of the struggle, worth more than 720,000 yuan. Zhang Shenyan even wormed his way into the Gaoyi Public Security Bureau as a production worker. Later, someone in the government discovered that he was a feudal landlord and asked the Xiguan cadres to request a certificate of residency and class status from Fangdeng Village. Zhang Shenyan found an unscrupulous element in Fangdeng Village who stole the village government's official seal and wrote a certificate stating that he was a bankrupt middle peasant and that there was nothing wrong with him being allocated the fruits of the struggle. For a time, they were misled by him. Later, the government wrote to the village chief of Fangdeng Village again to inquire, and the masses in Fangdeng Village realized that he had escaped here and demanded that he be returned for liquidation. The village chief of Fangdeng Village came in person to demand that he return the fruits of the struggle to the masses in Xiguan. However, after inspecting his property, it was only worth (according to the then-current market price) more than 240,000 yuan. In these few years, Zhang Shenyan wasted and stole more than 470,000 yuan of the masses' fruits. We hope that the masses in all regions will be vigilant and prevent feudal landlords from disguising themselves, playing all sorts of tricks, and deceiving and exploiting us.

　　防止地主改头换面
  　高邑查出外县隐蔽地主
    【高邑消息】本县西关有个临城县方等村的住户，叫张慎言，事变前他家有地九十余亩，是村中第二个地主。事变后方等村成了游击区。抗日政府领导人民实行减租减息，张慎言为了躲避群众清算，就卖了四十余亩地，在一九四二年全家逃到本县西关村磨面为生，后来又开了粮店。一九四四年解放后，他为了掩蔽自己的地主面目，假装积极，冒充贫雇，在群众运动时分了房屋土地及牲口等斗争果实，共值七十二万余元。张慎言又钻到高邑公安局当生产员。后来政府有人发现他是一个封建地主，便叫西关干部向他要方等村的迁居成份证明信。张慎言找了一个方等村的不良分子，偷盖村公所公章，写了一个证明信，说他是个破落中农，分果实没有什么。一时被他迷糊住了。后来政府又与方等村长去信，再次追问，方等群众才知道他逃到这里，要求将他要回清算。方等村长亲自来要，叫他把分的果实退给西关群众。但将他的财物检查后，只值（按当时市价）二十四万余元，在这几年中，张慎言浪费窃取群众果实四十七万余元。望各地群众提高警惕，防止封建地主改头换面，耍百般花样，欺骗剥削咱们。
