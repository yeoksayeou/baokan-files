Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Moscow dispatch: The official newspapers of the All-Union Communist Party and the Soviet government, published important editorials on New Year's Day, pointing out the significant achievements of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries in the past year and the impending destructive crisis facing the capitalist world. Izvestia stated: The Soviet people have victoriously completed the recovery plan and are moving towards greater victories. Pravda stated: "Completing the Five-Year Plan in Four Years," a slogan that resounds throughout the Soviet Union, is being transformed into new feats of selfless labor by Soviet patriots. One of the greatest domestic victories of the Soviet Union in 1947 was the abolition of the rationing system, currency reform, and local Soviet elections. The Soviet Union is the main force in the anti-imperialist camp against the mad plans to pursue global political hegemony. Pravda and Izvestia both pointed out: The people of Eastern Europe have shattered the chains of imperialism, causing the capitalist chains to break in several places, establishing new democratic countries here, and are now laying the foundation for the transition to socialism. As for the capitalist world, Pravda pointed out: Apart from destructive crises, the increasing impoverishment of the working people, the pain of unemployment, exploitation, brutal atrocities, the decline of morality and culture, and the horror of world war, there is nothing else to offer the people. Pravda emphasized: Everyone knows that the first sentence of the Communist Manifesto is: "A specter is haunting Europe—the specter of communism." In our era, when the ideas of communism are grasped by hundreds of millions of people, it has become an indestructible and enormous material force proven by the entire course of historical development.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Moscow dispatch: The "New Times" New Year editorial stated: In the past year, the international situation has undergone major changes, which have further polarized the political forces on the international stage. 1947 gave the American and British imperialists a final exposure; they openly opposed international cooperation and attempted to forcibly impose an imperialist peace. 1947 brought many major victories to socialism and democracy. American imperialists have virtually lost the first stage of their battle in Europe. They have aroused the anger and hatred of the masses who disregard being slaves of the aggressors across the Atlantic. The developments in Greece and the events in France and Italy serve as stern warnings. The capitalist world cannot escape the predicament of unsolvable economic difficulties. The United States, which serves as the pillar of the capitalist system, is suffering from a recession and knows that an economic crisis is inevitably approaching. On the other hand, the national economies of the Soviet Union and the democratic countries of Eastern Europe have greatly surpassed pre-war levels. The masters of the capitalist world feel the instability of their position and fear their inevitable failure in peaceful competition with socialism, so they are plotting new conspiracies and formulating evil plans. In addition to economic and political blackmail, they are also using the threat of the atomic bomb. The poisoned arrows of anti-communism have been widely used. Washington has mobilized the right-wing elements of the Socialist Party and the Labour Party to divide the ranks of the working class. However, their attempts cannot stop the growth of the communist movement and its influence among the masses. Not only is the position of European capitalism shaken, but the entire capitalist system is approaching its death. No prescription can cure the serious illness of capitalism, nor can it stop the development of progressive society. Mankind has firmly embarked on the path of socialism—the only path that can liberate us from imperialist exploitation, poverty, and the terror of new wars. We are living in an era where every road leads to communism, and every New Year brings us closer to this great goal.

### 苏联各报论国际形势　苏联胜利完成了复原计划　东欧已打碎帝国主义锁链

　　苏联各报论国际形势
    苏联胜利完成了复原计划
  　东欧已打碎帝国主义锁链
    【新华社陕北四日电】莫斯科讯：联共党与苏联政府机关报，于元旦均发表重要社论，指出一年来苏联与新民主国家的重大的成就与资本主义世界之面临毁灭性危机。消息报称：苏联人民胜利地完成了复原计划，朝着更大的胜利前进。真理报称：“五年计划四年完成”这一响遍全苏的口号，正被变为苏联爱国者奋不顾身的劳作新伟绩。一九四七年苏联内政最大胜利之一，就是废除配给制、货币改革和地方苏维埃选举。苏联是反对追求全世界政治霸权的疯狂计划的反帝阵营的主力。真理报和消息报一致指出：东欧人民已经粉碎了帝国主义锁链，使资本主义的链子崩裂好几环，在这里创立了新民主主义国家，现在正在奠定过渡到社会主义的基础。至于资本主义世界，真理报指出：除了毁灭性危机，除了劳动人民的日益赤贫，除了失业的痛苦、剥削、残酷的暴行、道德与文化的衰退，除了世界大战的恐怖之外，再也不能给人民以什么别的东西。真理报着重指出：大家知道，共产党宣言的第一句话是：“一个幽灵，共产主义的幽灵正在欧洲踯躅”。在我们这时代，当共产主义的思想为千百万人所掌握的时候，它已成了为整个历史发展过程所证明的不可摧毁的巨大物质力量。
    【新华社陕北五日电】莫斯科讯：“新时代”新年社论称：一年来国际形势又发生了重大变化，这种变化，使国际舞台上的政治力量更加各趋一端。一九四七年给了美、英帝国主义者一个最后的暴露，他们公开反对国际合作，企图强行帝国主义和平。一九四七年给社会主义与民主主义带来了许多重大胜利，美帝国主义者在欧洲战斗的第一阶段实际上已经输了，他们激起了不顾当大西洋彼岸侵略者的奴隶的人民群众的愤怒和憎恨。希腊的发展与法、意的事件，正是一个严厉的警告。资本主义世界无法摆脱不能解决的经济困难的苦境。充当资本主义体系台柱的美国，苦于市景萧条，晓得经济危机正在无可避免地日益迫近。另一面，苏联与东南欧民主国家的国民经济大踏步地超过战前水平。资本主义世界的主人们感觉到他们地位的不稳，并且害怕他们在与社会主义作和平竞争中的必然失败，于是便策划新阴谋，拟制罪恶的计划。除了经济与政治的讹诈之外，还辅之以原子弹的吓唬。反共的毒矢又被大肆运用了。华盛顿动员了社会党和工党右翼分子来分裂劳工阶级的行列。可是，他们的企图不能阻止共产主义运动及其在群众中影响的增长，不仅欧洲资本主义的地位动摇了，而且整个资本主义制度正在逼近死亡。任何药方都治不了资本主义的重病，停不住进步社会的发展。人类已经坚定地走上了社会主义的道路——唯一可以从帝国主义剥削、贫穷与新战争恐怖中解放出来的道路。我们所处的正是一个条条道路通达共产主义的时代，而每一个新年都使我们更接近于这伟大的目标。
