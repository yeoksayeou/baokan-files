Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan, 31st: During the battles to destroy the Pinghan and Longhai railways, the masses struggled against landlords and local tyrants everywhere, distributing grain and seized wealth. When the People's Liberation Army advanced to Hanzhuang, 40 li west of Kaifeng, the masses spontaneously settled accounts with a local tyrant landlord surnamed Han, recovering 20,000 jin of grain and more than 10,000 jin of peanuts. The poor people distributed the grain and discussed organizing a "Poor People's Association." As soon as Zhuxian Town was liberated, the masses in the town overthrew Yang Tingchen, the town's first Bao chief, a murderer for the enemy, puppet regime, and the KMT, and a local tyrant who had been drinking the blood of the people for more than a decade. After a public trial, he was sentenced to death. Amidst the rumble of artillery surrounding the four passes of Xuchang, poor peasants and farmhands in Tongzhuang, a dozen li east of Xuchang, joined forces to distribute the grain and wealth of several local tyrant landlords, including one surnamed Liang. After Changge was liberated, the masses in the city distributed the grain of eight local tyrant landlords, including Chen Xiufeng, a member of the KMT Henan Provincial Council. When the People's Liberation Army was stationed in Sangshumiao, eight li southeast of Weichuan, the masses distributed 5,000 jin of grain and all the wealth of Li Ruisheng, the KMT secretary and local tyrant landlord. The Changge County Relief Home was controlled by landlords, and all the orphans were underfed and poorly clothed. The People's Liberation Army used grain, cloth, and cotton to help them, and the children happily sang: "The poor people's army has come to save the suffering people."

Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Yu, Shan, and E, 31st: After the People's Liberation Army entered Zhumadian, Queshan, Suiping and other places along the Pinghan Railway, it immediately opened the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's major warehouses and distributed the mountains of rice and wheat to the poor. The officers and soldiers distributing grain were unable to sleep for several days and nights in order to distribute grain to the masses. In the first three days alone, more than 980,000 jin of grain were distributed, saving more than 20,000 starving people who were on the verge of death under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits.

　　平汉陇海沿线新区
  　农民到处分粮分钱
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线三十一日电】平汉陇海两路破击战中，群众到处斗争地主恶霸，分粮分浮财。解放军挺进到开封西四十里的韩庄时，群众自动向一个姓韩的恶霸地主清算，收回粮食二万斤，花生一万多斤。穷人们一面分粮，一面商量组织“穷人会”。朱仙镇刚才解放，全镇群众就斗倒了镇上第一保保长、敌伪顽三朝凶手、十几年来专喝民血的恶霸杨挺臣。经过公审判处死刑。在围攻许昌四关的隆隆炮声中，许昌东十几里的同庄贫雇农就相互串连将梁姓等数家恶霸地主的粮食浮财分掉。长葛解放后，城内群众就分了伪河南省参议员陈秀峰等八家恶霸地主的粮食。解放军进驻洧川东南八里的桑树庙时，群众就将国民党书记长恶霸地主李瑞生家粮食五千斤和全部浮财分掉。原长葛县救济院被地主把持，全数孤儿吃不饱穿不暖，解放军用粮食、布匹、棉花救济他们，孩子们高兴的唱着：“穷人的队伍来了，救了苦命人。”
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线三十一日电】解放军进入平汉沿线驻马店、确山、遂平等地后，立即打开蒋匪各大仓库，把堆积如山的米麦散发给贫民。我军放粮人员为了分粮给群众，几天几夜不能睡眠。仅最初三天就发粮食九十八万多斤，使两万余在蒋匪统治下快要死亡的饥民得救。
