Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th: Comrade Li Zhuoran, Propaganda Minister of the Northwest Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, made a self-criticism on propaganda work at the Border Region Land Conference, saying: In the war to defend the Border Region, the Party's propaganda work was exposed as the weakest link in all wartime work. The basic error was that the work was divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, and lacked a clear class viewpoint. In terms of cadre education, the leadership did not criticize and struggle against the ideological shortcomings or serious errors of cadres in the land reform and the war, or the criticism was not thorough enough. The issues revealed at this conference, such as sheltering landlords and rich peasants, failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, bureaucracy, warlordism, and petty-bourgeois individualism, etc., were due to the leadership's past bureaucracy, which failed to discover them, or failed to insist on criticizing them thoroughly, and failed to use the typical examples as teaching materials to draw the attention of the entire Party. I deeply feel that I have failed in my duty. This liberal attitude is also one of the reasons why cadre education is divorced from reality. As for studying and summarizing practical experience as educational material, it is a good way to eliminate blindness, and it is also education on specific policies. In the past, our achievements in this area were too poor, which is a manifestation of theoretical work lagging behind practical movements. We must overcome this, and I must also bear the main responsibility for this. Regarding the education of rural Party members, it can only take effect when combined with the actual movements of rural struggles. Education should be carried out in the struggle against the enemy, against landlords and despots, and against cadres who use coercion and commandism and embezzle the fruits of land reform; in production organizations, stretcher transport teams, and various meetings; and when distributing land, distributing floating wealth, determining class status, and accepting or expelling Communist Party members. These are all the most practical education, and as long as there is leadership, Party members can educate themselves. However, some Party member cadres go to the countryside only to arrange work as usual, never look for branches, never look for Party members, and do not do any work to educate Party members. This is an unforgivable mistake. After reviewing the above errors, Comrade Zhuoran analyzed the origins, saying: The current propaganda department's ranks are very impure, with very few poor and lower-middle peasant components, lacking mass feelings, and even completely looking down on the masses. In terms of leadership, there is a lack of mass viewpoints in thinking, a lack of specificity and seriousness in work, and the resulting bureaucracy and liberalism. Without removing these two things, the work cannot be done well. After this meeting, I am determined to remove these two bad things from myself and hope everyone will supervise and help.

Regarding future work, Comrade Zhuoran proposed that the "Double Ten Declaration" of the Chinese People's Liberation Army must be deeply disseminated to the broad masses, calling on them to strive to realize the various policies in the declaration. The current cultural and educational ranks in the Border Region must be rectified according to the spirit of the Land Conference, and a large number of cultural and educational workers must be organized to learn and train in the land reform. Schools should absorb a large number of workers and peasants. Newspapers should strengthen close ties with the masses, so that they can truly become the Party's weapons for guiding work in the war and land reform, and the struggle against "empty talk" must continue. Finally, Comrade Zhuoran emphasized that all Party propaganda work must be closely combined with the masses and reality. Every Party member propaganda worker must constantly review and train themselves to become a fighter who wholeheartedly serves the people.

　　党的一切宣传工作
  　必须提高阶级性
  　西北局李卓然同志检讨
    【新华社西北十三日电】中共西北局宣传部长李卓然同志在边区土地会议上检讨宣教工作说：在保卫边区的战争中，暴露了党的宣传工作是战时各种工作中最薄弱的一环，其基本错误，是在工作中脱离群众、脱离实际、缺乏明确的阶级观点。在干部教育方面，领导上对于土地改革和战争中干部思想上的缺点或严重错误，没有进行批评与斗争，或进行得很不彻底。这次大会揭露的，如包庇地主富农、敌我不分、官僚主义、军阀主义，以及小资产阶级的个人主义等等，就是由于过去领导上官僚主义，没有发现，或没有坚持批评到底，没有把其中的典型例子作为教材，提起全党的注意，我深感自己失职。这种自由主义的态度，也就是使干部教育脱离实际的原因之一。至于研究与总结实际经验作为教育材料，是去掉盲目性的好办法，也就是具体政策的教育，过去我们在这方面的成绩太差，也就是理论工作落后于实际运动的表现，必须克服，这点我也要负主要责任。关于农村党员教育，只有与农村具体斗争实际运动相结合才能生效，要在对敌斗争，向地主恶霸斗争，向强迫命令与贪污土地改革果实的干部斗争时去教育，要在生产组织中、担架运输队中和各种会议中去教育，要在分土地、分浮财、定成份、接收或开除共产党员时去教育，这些都是最实际的教育，只要有人领导，党员自己就可以教育自己。但有些党员干部下乡只是照例布置工作，从来不找支部，不找党员，不做任何教育党员的工作，这是犯了不可容许的错误。关于群众教育，日本投降以后，对外的民族斗争变为国内阶级斗争，但是关于打倒蒋介石消灭地主阶级的宣传，在群众中却做得很差。“全党要作宣传工作”，远在一九三九年边区党二次代表大会上就提出了，但直至今日尚未贯彻。卓然同志于检讨上述错误后，分析与产生根源说：目前宣教部门的队伍很不纯洁，贫雇农成份很少，缺乏群众情感，甚至完全看不起群众。在领导上，则是思想上缺乏群众观点，工作中缺乏具体性与严肃性，及由此而产生的官僚主义与自由主义毛病。不去掉这两个东西，工作便无法做好。这次会议后，我决心把自己身上这两件坏东西去掉，希望大家监督帮助。
    关于今后工作，卓然同志提出必须把中国人民解放军的双十宣言深入传达到广大群众中去，号召他们为实现宣言中的各项政策而奋斗。对目前边区的文教队伍，必须根据土地会议精神加以整顿，并组织大批文教工作者到土地改革中去学习与锻炼。学校应大量吸收工农分子入学。报纸应加强与群众的密切联系，使它真能成为党在战争与土地改革中指导工作的武器，要继续开展反“客里空”斗争。最后卓然同志强调指出党的一切宣传工作，必须密切与群众和实际相结合，每个党员宣传工作者必须经常检讨与锻炼自己，成为全心全意为人民服务的战斗员。
