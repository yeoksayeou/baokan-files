The Taihang Xinhua Daily Calls for Overcoming Misinterpretations of the Land Law

[This Newspaper's News] The Taihang Xinhua Daily published an editorial on the 15th, entitled "Overcoming Misinterpretations and Misunderstandings of the Land Law Outline." The gist of it said: Recently, it has been discovered that a small number of landlord elements, after the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, are taking advantage of the fact that the masses have not yet taken action and the propaganda has not yet penetrated deeply, attempting to provoke disunity among the masses, create chaos, and launch a counter-offensive; or using the excuse that landlords also get a share, threatening the masses by saying that past struggles were wrong; or provoking the unity of middle peasants and poor peasants, saying that future equal distribution will involve dividing the land and property of middle peasants; saying that equal distribution means taking everything everyone owns and dividing it on the street; or intimidating some cadres and activists who have taken too many gains in the past, saying that they will be struggled against in the future; even colluding with a small number of bad elements and corrupt officials who have encroached on the gains of the masses, establishing fake "Poor Peasants' Associations" and "Poor and Hired Peasants Committees." It must be pointed out that these are all conspiracies of a small number of landlord elements, attempts by a small number of local elements to use the low cultural level of the masses or the insufficient mobilization, and to exploit certain weaknesses of cadres and activists, to carry out restorationist criminal acts. The peasants and leading organs throughout the region must pay close attention to these conspiracies and tricks. If they do not cease their activities, the government organs will arrest them according to the law when the equal distribution movement begins, and they will be prosecuted.

Due to the rumors and sabotage of a small number of landlords and bad elements, misunderstandings and unrest have been caused among a section of the masses (especially middle peasants), resulting in phenomena of excessive eating and drinking, wasting property, not engaging in production, and waiting for equal distribution. This is extremely harmful. The policy of equal distribution of land is only to confiscate the land and property of landlords, requisition the surplus land and property of rich peasants, and distribute it to peasants who lack these things (poor peasants, hired peasants, rural workers, and a portion of middle peasants); for well-to-do middle peasants, it is only through consultation and with their consent that they voluntarily contribute a portion of their surplus land. The property, farm tools, livestock, and other movable property of well-to-do middle peasants will not be touched at all, and ordinary middle peasants will not suffer any losses, while lower-middle peasants can even get some land and property. The basic spirit of the Land Law Outline is to completely eliminate feudalism, satisfy the demands of hired and poor peasants, and at the same time, firmly unite the middle peasants. We advise those middle peasant masses who misunderstand the Land Law Outline or have been incited by landlord elements to stop this waste and continue to work diligently in production with peace of mind.

As for the small number of landlords, rich peasants, and a small number of bad elements who have encroached on the gains of the masses, wasting, dispersing, and selling things that should be taken out in the future is a criminal act and will be prosecuted in the future.

There are also a small number of cadres who have taken too many gains in the turnaround movement, stubbornly insist on their mistakes, do not want to withdraw the over-occupied portion according to the law, and in order to maintain this portion of the gains, have already taken some improper measures, such as infringing on middle peasants, expanding the scope of struggle, indiscriminate killings, etc. Now that they hear that there will be equal distribution, they are afraid of taking out their over-occupied gains, afraid that landlords and rich peasants will also get a share, and want to take the opportunity to launch a round of indiscriminate struggle before the equal distribution, sacrificing others to preserve the over-occupied gains. This is detrimental to poor peasants, and it is also a criminal act, which must be strictly stopped. Indiscriminate struggle and indiscriminate killing are no longer allowed to occur. If illegal killings occur, they must be severely punished according to the law.

In addition, at present, villages are brewing the division of classes, and many deviations have occurred in this issue. The main problem is the excessive expansion of the proportion of landlords and rich peasants - "tracing three generations," "weighing Du Lu" (such as one landlord family being divided into forty families, and all forty families being counted as landlords), etc. Even some villages have landlords and rich peasants accounting for 20% to 30% of the population, and individual villages even reaching 60%, which is very dangerous. Due to such a division, many masses (even hired and poor peasants) have become uneasy. We tell the peasants throughout the region: these divisions do not count now. In the future, after the equal distribution begins, they will all be divided according to unified regulations. "Tracing three generations" and "weighing Du Lu" will not be done. The class component of each household must be discussed and approved by the masses. If the village cannot make a clear division or if they have opinions themselves, they can also submit it to the district, county, or agricultural representatives' conferences above the district and county for discussion and decision.

### 太行新华日报号召　克服对土地法的曲解

　　太行新华日报号召
  　克服对土地法的曲解
    【本报消息】太行新华日报在十五日发表了一篇社论，题目叫作“克服对于土地法大纲的曲解和误解”。大意说：近来发现少数地主分子，在土地法大纲公布之后，利用群众尚未行动起来，宣传尚未深入的空子，企图挑拨群众团结，制造混乱现象，进行反攻；或借口地主也分一份，威胁群众说过去斗争错了；或挑拨中农和贫农的团结，说将来平分要分中农的土地财产；说平分就是把各家所有的东西都拿到街上来分；或恐吓某些过去多占果实的干部积极分子，说将来要斗争他们；甚或拉拢少数侵占群众果实的坏分子和贪污腐化分子，成立假“贫农团”、“贫雇委员会”。必须指出这都是少数地主分子的阴谋，是少数地方分子企图利用群众文化程度低或发动不充分，利用干部积极分子的某些弱点，来进行复辟的犯罪行为。对于这种阴谋诡计，全区农民和领导机关必须严密注视，如果他们不停止活动，必要时政府机关即依法逮捕，在平分运动开始之后必将加以究办。
    由于少数地主及少数坏分子的造谣破坏，引起了一部分群众（特别是中农）的误解与动荡，发生大吃大喝，浪费财物，不事生产，坐待平分的现象，这是极端有害的。平分土地的政策只是没收地主的土地财产，征收富农多余的土地财产，分给缺少这些东西的农民（贫农、雇农、乡村工人及一部分中农）；对于富裕中农，也只是用协商的办法，取得他们的同意，自动献出多余的一部分土地，富裕中农的财产、农具、牲口等浮财是丝毫不动的，至于一般的中农则更是不会有任何损失的，下中农还可分到一些土地财产。土地法大纲的基本精神是要彻底消灭封建，满足雇贫要求，同时是坚固的团结中农的。我们劝告这些误解土地法大纲或受了地主分子煽动的中农群众，停止这种浪费，继续安心的努力生产。
    至于少数地主富农和少数侵占群众果实的坏分子，现在浪费、分散、出卖了将来应该拿出来的东西，这是犯罪行为，将来是要究办的。
    还有少数干部人员，在翻身运动中，多占了斗争果实，始终坚持自己的错误，不想依法退出多占部分，并且为了保持这一部分果实，已经采取了一些不正当的办法，如侵害中农，扩大斗争面，乱杀人………等等。现在听说要平分，恐怕拿出自己多占果实，恐怕给地主富农也分一份，又想在平分以前，趁机先乱斗一阵，牺牲别人，来保存多占果实，这是对贫苦农民不利的，这也是犯罪行为，必须严厉制止。再不允许发生乱斗乱杀的现象，如果发生违法杀人的事件一定要依法严惩。
    此外，现在各个村庄，都在酝酿划分阶级，在这一问题上，也发生了很多偏向，主要的问题是过份扩大了地主富农的比重——“追三代”、“掂都芦”（如一家地主分成四十家，四十家都算地主）………，甚至有些村庄地主富农占了户口百分之二十至三十，个别村庄竟占到百分之六十，这是十分危险的。由于这样的划法，引起了许多群众（甚至雇贫）的不安。我们告诉全区的农民：现在这些划法都不算数，将来平分开始以后，都按照统一的规定来划，不“追三代”，不“掂都芦”，每户的阶级成份都要在群众中讨论通过，村里划不清或自己有意见的还可以提交区、县或区县以上的农代会讨论决定。
