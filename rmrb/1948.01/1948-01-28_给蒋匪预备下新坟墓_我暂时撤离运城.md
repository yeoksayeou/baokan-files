Preparing a New Graveyard for Chiang Kai-shek's Bandits
　　We Temporarily Withdraw from Yuncheng

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Since the People's Liberation Army captured Yuncheng and completely eliminated Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in the Jinan Triangle area, the Northwest strategic locations of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, such as Tongguan and Xi'an, have been severely threatened. The bandit leader Hu Zongnan panicked and hurriedly resorted to desperate measures, pulling troops from here and there to make up for losses, and transferring five so-called "elite" divisions, including the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division, the 78th Brigade, two brigades of the 36th Division, and the 27th Brigade of the 30th Division, under the unified command of Dong Zhao, commander of the Reorganized 1st Army. On the 6th of this month, they crossed the river at Lingbao and advanced north along the highway via Jiexian, encountering successive resistance from our local guerrilla forces along the way, filled with fear and trepidation. Shrinking back and crawling slowly, they took six days to cover just over a hundred *li*. They only sneaked into Yuncheng on the 11th. Our strong main forces had already occupied favorable positions, waiting for the opportunity to strike. This Yuncheng, the northern foot of the Zhongtiao Mountains, which shields Xi'an and Luoyang, will once again become the graveyard of these Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

　　给蒋匪预备下新坟墓
  　我暂时撤离运城
    【本报特讯】自解放军打下运城，全部肃清晋南三角地带的蒋匪后，潼关、西安等蒋匪西北战略要地，立即受到严重威胁。匪首胡宗南惊慌失措，急忙东扯西调，剜肉补疮，抽调第一师第一旅、第七十八旅、第三十六师两个旅、三十师二十七旅等五个所谓“劲旅”，由整编第一军军长董钊统一指挥，本月六日在灵宝渡河，经解县沿公路北犯，途中遭我地方游击队节节阻击，胆战心惊。缩头缩脑，一步爬行，一百多里走了六天。十一日才窜据运城，我强大主力部队早已占领有利阵地，待机出动。使这一屏障西安与洛阳的中条山北麓之运城，又将成为这些蒋匪的坟墓。
