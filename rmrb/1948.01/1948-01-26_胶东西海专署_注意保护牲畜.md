The Jiaodong West Sea Prefecture recently decided on the following measures to protect livestock: (1) Female livestock such as cattle, horses, and donkeys shall be exempt from public service for three months before and after giving birth. Breeding livestock and their managers shall be exempt from public service for four months from the Beginning of Spring (Yushui), and no additional service shall be required outside the service period. (2) Households with breeding livestock and female livestock who are poor and unable to raise them may be granted loans by the government for assistance.
