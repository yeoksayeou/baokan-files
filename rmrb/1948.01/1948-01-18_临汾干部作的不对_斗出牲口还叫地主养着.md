　　Linfen Cadres Acted Incorrectly
  　After Confiscating Livestock, They Still Had the Landlords Raise Them
    [Taiyue News] According to a report from a Linfen correspondent: Since Linfen started land reform last July, a lot of livestock have been confiscated. However, in many cases, the cadres had the targets of struggle raise them instead of distributing them to poor peasants and farmhands who lacked livestock. Poor peasants and farmhands were very worried about cultivating the land without livestock. For example, in Lijiachuang, four oxen were confiscated in August, but they were all fed by the targets of struggle, who fed them so well that they could barely walk. In Beiguo Village, the four donkeys that were confiscated were also treated this way. The poor peasants and farmhands of Lijiachuang said, "If the livestock had been distributed earlier, we could have grown the wheat well, the oxen wouldn't have become so thin, and our difficulties would have been resolved. Now, no one wants to buy them."

　　临汾干部作的不对
  　斗出牲口还叫地主养着
    【太岳消息】据临汾通讯员报告：临汾从去年七月闹土地改革到现在，斗出了好多牲口，可是有好多没分给没牲口的雇贫，干部倒叫斗争对象喂起来了。雇贫没牲口，种地干着急。如李家庄在八月份斗出四头牛，都叫斗争对象伙喂，他们把牛喂得连路也走不动了。还有北锅村斗出的四头驴，也弄成这个样子。李家庄雇贫农说：“牲口早分了，麦能种好，牛也瘦不了，咱们困难也得到解决，现在卖也没人要了。”
