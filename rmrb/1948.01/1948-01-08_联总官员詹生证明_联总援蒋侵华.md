　　UN Official Jenson Proves
  　UNRRA Aided Chiang Kai-shek's Aggression Against China

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Shanghai, 28th Dispatch: An article published in the Shanghai-based American "Millard's Review" by Austrian UNRRA official Frederick A. Jenson, proves that UNRRA was a tool for American aid to Chiang Kai-shek's aggression against China. Jenson pointed out that UNRRA's "relief" in China was merely a conspiracy, saying: "There is strong evidence that the entire conspiracy was implemented under the leadership of the U.S. State Department from beginning to end. The State Department opposed UNRRA adopting a non-discriminatory policy." Jenson proved that the U.S. State Department took the lead in preventing relief supplies from being transported to the Liberated Areas. Jenson said: Trucks and locomotives sent to China were used to transport troops fighting the civil war, grain sent to China enabled the government (Kuomintang) to feed its troops, textiles were used for military uniforms, money from the sale of relief supplies was used to support the army, and machinery and technical equipment fell into the hands of the most reactionary bureaucrats, strengthening their power. Relief supplies were used as political bribes following the "Kuomintang" offensive army and to support landlord groups to prevent other political activities. At the same time, millions of people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas who participated in the heroic War of Resistance Against Japan were trapped in hunger and cold and received no relief. Jenson said: UNRRA supported the Kuomintang in engaging in a civil war, the purpose of which was to oppose the Communist Party which was implementing land reform and all people in the Kuomintang-ruled areas who demanded democracy and freedom. However, after the end of World War II, the basic demand of the Chinese people was the redistribution of land as a basis for making a living.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. According to a foreign news agency dispatch from Qingdao on the 1st: Students of Chiang Kai-shek's Shandong University in Qingdao went on strike and demonstrated on New Year's Day, protesting against the university president's embezzlement when distributing UNRRA relief supplies, and selling UNRRA medical equipment such as heroin (narcotics). The striking students demanded a thorough investigation of this corruption case.

　　联总官员詹生证明
  　联总援蒋侵华
    【新华社陕北四日电】上海二十八日消息：联总官员奥地利人弗罗德力克Ａ·詹生在上海美商密勒士评论报上发表的文章，证明联总为美国援蒋侵华工具。詹生指出联总在中国的“救济”只是一个阴谋诡计，他说：“有强有力的证明整个阴谋诡计，从头到尾都是在美国国务院领导之下实现的，国务院反对联总采取不歧视政策。”詹生证明美国务院曾带头来阻止救济物资运往解放区。詹生说：运到中国的卡车和火车头都被用来运输打内战的军队，运到中国的粮食使政府（国民党）能够用它来养活其军队，纺织品用来作军衣，出售救济物资得来的钱用来支持军队，机器与技术设备落入最反动的官僚之手，加强了他们的力量，救济物资被用作紧跟着“国民党”进攻军之后的政治上的收买和用以支持地主团体不作其他政治勾当。同时成千百万参加英勇抗日战争的国民党地区人民，则陷于饥寒交迫，毫未得到救济。詹生说：联总支持国民党从事内战，这个内战的目的是反对实行土地改革的共产党及国民党统治区域一切要求民主自由的人民。但第二次世界大战结束后，中国人民的基本要求就是重新分配土地作为谋生的基础。
    【新华社陕北四日电】据外国通讯社青岛一日讯：青岛蒋记山东大学学生于元旦罢课游行，反对该校校长在分配联总救济物资时贪污，将联总医药器材海洛英（麻醉剂）等出售。罢课游行学生要求澈查此一贪污案。
