　　Poor Peasant Zhang Wanfang of Jile Village Requests to Get Rid of His Landlord Wife
  　Local Leaders Should Resolve This Immediately

Editor Comrade:
    Zhang Wanfang of Jile Village is in his fifties. He worked as a farmhand for others from the age of fourteen until he was over forty, when he finally returned home and bought more than twenty mu of poor land to cultivate. His wife died of worry during the famine of 1942 because they couldn't make a living, leaving behind two daughters who have both married. He lives with his eldest son's wife and two sons (the second son is seventeen, and the third son is over ten, neither of whom are married).
    Last year, in the twelfth lunar month, Zhang married the wife of the village landlord Wang ×× (age fifty-six). Last year, in the first lunar month, his wife's son-in-law came for the holiday. His wife asked Zhang Wanfang to butcher meat and buy wine for her son-in-law (who is also a landlord). Zhang Wanfang refused because he was short of money. This made her unhappy. That evening, she got angry with Zhang Wanfang and lay down on the kang, refusing to get up. Zhang Wanfang, to get through the days, spoke nicely to her, but she wouldn't listen, and he pleaded with her again and again. His wife said, "If you want me to live with you, you must agree to my conditions: first, we must eat noodles every day; second, the clothes for your two sons (referring to Zhang Wanfang's two sons) must be sewn by my two daughters; third, I must have a constant allowance of pocket money." Zhang couldn't answer, and this caused a scene. She lay on the kang, just getting angry and not doing any work. Zhang Wanfang went to the fields to work, and when he came back for dinner in the evening, she had already eaten and gone to sleep, still acting like a landlord; she kept complaining that life wasn't as good as before, often saying how good life was in the landlord's house in the past. She doesn't want to work all day long. Throughout the year, she only made three cloth shirts, two pairs of trousers, and one lined outfit for herself, without doing any sewing for Zhang Wanfang and his three sons. Zhang Wanfang couldn't even say anything even when he had no clothes to wear. There was another quarrel during the Autumn Equinox festival over eating noodles. She also keeps stealing things. Once, she was caught stealing cloth, but she refused to admit it. The matter was brought to the Farmers' Association for struggle, but not only did she not change, but she became even angrier than before. She ran to her former daughter's house and wouldn't come back. After being brought back, she was still angry and wouldn't move. Zhang Wanfang couldn't bear it, and wanted to divorce her. The village cadres said, "If you divorce her, you have to provide for her living expenses for three years. This is the government's policy, otherwise it won't work. Now you can't marry a landlord, and you can't divorce one either." Zhang Wanfang couldn't cope, and he has no heart for production. He is so anxious that he is willing to give up some things, even willing to let her go without anything. Now that the New Year is coming, he has nothing to wear, and the children need clothes. He hopes to know if he can get a divorce, and asks for justice. Please reply. (Lü Zhengtang, Guo Yuxiang, Wang Wanming, Lian Shuangjin)

    Poor peasant Zhang Wanfang suffered a great loss by marrying a landlord's woman, and his request for divorce is completely reasonable. The local leadership should resolve this for him immediately. The village cadres are using laws to obstruct people arbitrarily. Zhang Wanfang has no way to appeal, which is caused by the bureaucracy of the past leadership. This style is very bad. Now we are publishing the reader's original letter, hoping that this matter can be resolved quickly, and that the process of resolution will be written to us. —Editor

### 集乐村贫雇张万方要求摆脱地主老婆　当地领导上应该马上给解决

　　集乐村贫雇张万方要求摆脱地主老婆
  　当地领导上应该马上给解决编辑同志：
    集乐村张万方，年五十几岁，自十四岁与人家当长工，到四十多岁才回家买了二十多亩歹地种。他妻在三十一年灾荒时因没法生活愁死了，丢下二个闺女都嫁了。有三个儿子，大儿子现年二十五岁，三十四年古历七月参军了。张万方与他大儿媳和二个儿子过日子（二儿子十七岁、三子十多岁，都未结婚）。
    去年古历十二月张与本村地主王××之妻（年五十六）结了婚，到去年正月时他妻的女婿来过节，他妻叫张万方与她女婿（亦是个地主）割肉装酒，张万方因钱困难不肯，这就惹起她不如意，晚上与张万方生气躺到炕上不起来，张万方为了过时光，说好话不听，再三再四的劝解央告。他妻说：要与你过，得许我条件：一、每天不断面吃。二、两个儿子（指张万方二个儿子）的衣服叫二个闺女缝。三、要不断零花钱。张没法答复，这就闹起来了，躺到炕上光生气不做活。张万方去地做活，晚上回来吃饭时，她早吃了饭睡了，还象地主那样派头；并嚷着不如从前好过，常说从前在地主家生活如何好。整天的不想劳动，一年中只给自己做了三个布衫、二条单裤、一身夹衣服，没有与张万方父子三人做一点针线。张万方穿不上衣服，还不敢说。过立秋节为吃面又闹了一场。她还不断往外偷东西。有次偷布被捉住，她不服，交到农会斗了一下，她不但不改，而且越比以前更生气了，跑到他从前女儿家不回来，接回来后还是生气不动。张万方没法，要与她离婚，村干部说：你要离管人家三年吃穿，这是政府的政策，不然不行。现在与地主亦不能结，亦不能离。张万方没法，上区公所打听，进门遇见伙夫王黑珠说明这事，珠说：你没手续，快回去吧，区没村手续不管。张万方这样没法过，生产亦没心事了，急的愿出点东西，也愿意不要她。目下过年没啥穿，孩子们要衣服。他希望知道能不能离婚，诉冤，请给答复。（吕正堂、郭玉祥、王万铭、连双金）
    贫雇张万方和地主女人结婚吃了大亏，现在请求离婚，是完全合道理的。当地领导上应立即给他解决才对。村干部用法令乱卡人，张万方告状无门，这是过去领导上的官僚主义造成的，这种作风很不好。现在我们把读者的原信登出，希望这件事能很快得到解决，并将解决的经过写给我们。——编者
