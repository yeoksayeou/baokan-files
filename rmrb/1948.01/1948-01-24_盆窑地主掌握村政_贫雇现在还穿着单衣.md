　　Pen Kiln Landlords Control Village Politics

　　Poor and Hired Laborers Still Wear Thin Clothes

[Qinyang News] Pen Kiln Village in the Second District has 350 households and has always been considered an advanced village in mass movement. However, during an inspection in December last year, it was discovered that the poor and hired peasants had not thoroughly turned over, and feudalism had not been overthrown. Fifteen households of poor and hired peasants still live in extreme poverty: the 63-year-old poor peasant Tian Weishi only has 2.2 mu of hillside land, and last autumn harvested 5.2 dou of corn, of which 4 dou was to be paid to the mutual aid team as wages. She cried for a whole day before negotiating with the mutual aid team to spin four jin of cotton to offset the wages. She has nothing at home. She said, "When dividing the fruits of labor, I wanted a water tank, but the cadre said: You are dying soon, what do you need that for! So they took it back." The poor peasant Ren Dushi and her two daughters still live in a small kiln without a door, which is cold when the door is open during the day and dark when it is closed; at night, they have no lamp or fire and have to go to the neighbor's house to make a living. The impoverished Zhang Tianshi only received a small kiln and 10,000 yuan in the struggle. She is already 63 years old and cannot spin much more cotton. Her life is very difficult. They can only eat two meals of corn grits a day. Wang Bao's wife is still wearing thin clothes. On the other hand, the landlords and rich peasants actually still control the village politics, and the lives of six rich peasant households are still the same as before. There are a total of 14 people detached from production in the village cooperative, of which the objects of struggle account for seven, and one of them even served as a puppet Bao chief for eight years. They serve as managers, runners, and other main cadres, eat at the cooperative (eating white flour every day), use things from the cooperative, do not pay labor, and still receive a monthly salary. Two hundred and eighty households joined the cooperative with a total share capital of 4,693,000 yuan, but only six poor peasant households joined, with a share capital of only 27,000 yuan. Such a cooperative certainly cannot serve the poor and hired peasants. Those with connections can borrow the cooperative's ox carts, but the poor cannot borrow them. Therefore, the poor and hired peasants reflected, "The cooperative belongs to those who are objects of struggle." (Zhipeng, Qifu)

　　盆窑地主掌握村政
  　贫雇现在还穿着单衣
    【沁阳消息】二区盆窑村有三百五十户，一向被认为是群运先进村。但在去年十二月检查时，发现了贫雇翻身很不透，封建更没有打垮。贫雇农里有十五户还过着十分穷困的生活：六十三岁的贫农田魏氏只有坡地二亩二分，去年秋天打了玉茭五斗二升，要给互助组出四斗工资；哭了一天，才和互助组商议好纺四斤花顶替工资。家里什么也没有。她说：“分果实时我想要个水缸，干部说：你快死了，要那干啥！就给顶回来了。”贫农任杜氏母女三人，还住着一个没风门的小窑，白天开门冷、关门黑；黑夜里没灯没火，只得凑到邻家作生活。赤贫张田氏斗争中只分了一孔小窑和一万元钱，她已六十三岁，花都不能多纺了，生活十分困难。她们每天只能吃两顿玉茭圪糁。王保的女人到现在还穿着单衣。在另一方面，地主富农实际上还掌握着村政，有六户富农的生活还和从前一样。村合作社里共有十四个脱离生产人员，其中斗争对象占了七人，有一人还当过八年伪保长。他们当的是经理、跑外等主要干部，吃在社里（每天吃白面），用在社里，不支差，每月还拿薪水。二百八十户在合作社里入了股，股金共计四百六十九万三千元，里面只有六户贫农，股金才二万七千元。这样的合作社当然不能替贫雇办事，社里牛车有法的可以借，穷人就借不出。所以贫雇反映说：“合作社就是人家斗争对象们的”。（志鹏、起富）
