Comrades:

　　Last Double Tenth Festival, our Party Central Committee promulgated the "Outline Land Law of China." From October to December, the Central Bureau convened a regional land conference, conducted strict criticism and self-criticism, resolutely opposed landlord-rich peasant ideology, rogue ideology, and Westernized forgetful ideology. Everyone unanimously supported and prepared to resolutely implement the "Outline Land Law of China." In the upcoming regional land reform review and thorough land distribution movement, we must rely on the poor peasants, consolidate the alliance with the middle peasants, eliminate feudal and semi-feudal exploitative land systems, and meet the demands of landless and land-poor peasants. We must ensure that everyone has land to cultivate, a house to live in, food to eat, and clothes to wear, so that the vast number of poor peasants can completely turn themselves over and become masters of their own destiny. We Communist Party members should resolutely implement the "Outline Land Law of China," consult with peasants on all matters, carefully study thorough land distribution methods with them, and lead all peasants to implement this outline and achieve the complete liberation of the peasants.

　　Our border region's land reform movement has been underway for more than two years. Some areas have done a relatively thorough job, and many Communist Party members have shown exemplary performance in the land reform movement, being brave in struggle and yielding in the distribution of fruits, not taking any advantage, and sharing equally with the masses. In leading the struggle, they proceeded from the perspective of the poor and hired peasants, took care of their interests, consolidated the alliance with the middle peasants, consulted with the masses on all matters, followed the mass line, and did not act until the masses had fully discussed and prepared; they did not force or command, and were able to patiently persuade those few who acted extremely and disregarded the overall situation, without tailism. They honestly served the people as farmhands, without taking credit or being proud, and they served as farmhands very well. They maintained close contact with the masses from beginning to end, and the masses cherished them very much. However, many areas have not been thoroughly reformed, and some are even very far from thorough. Even in areas where land reform has been relatively thorough, there are still problems with unfair distribution of land and property. For example, Party members from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds protect their families and relatives; leading organs, troops, and organizations listen to the one-sided words of landlords and rich peasants, are fooled by them, and become "air-raid shelters" for landlords and rich peasants. Some Party members are selfish and self-interested in land reform, distributing more fruits to themselves, even forcibly occupying and stealing the fruits of the masses, distributing land, houses, clothes, livestock, furniture, etc., that are plentiful and good. In particular, many Party members have very bad work styles, standing on the heads of the people, acting as overlords, not obeying the opinions of the majority of the masses, forcing orders, acting arbitrarily, completely in the style of Kuomintang masters, opening up thinking by “the cadres beat and the masses are persuaded”, mutually covering up, “you defend me, I support you.” Many bad Party members and bad cadres have become anti-people small cliques, "a hornet's nest, untouchable," opposing the poor and hired, becoming enemies of the people, alienating themselves from the masses, and the people are very dissatisfied with them. The land, houses, clothes, livestock, furniture, etc., distributed to the poor and hired are few and bad, and some poor and hired people still have no land to cultivate, no houses to live in, and no clothes to wear, and have no say in the countryside, let alone working in the government or farmers' associations. In the past, the poor and hired were exploited by the landlord class, but today they are oppressed by this part of bad Party members and bad cadres. With the Party so impure and these bad Party members and bad cadres pressing down on the peasants, how can the poor and hired be completely liberated? How can the unity of the middle peasants be consolidated? How can feudalism be completely eliminated? How can land be thoroughly distributed equally? In the upcoming movement to review land reform and distribute land equally, all Communist Party members who have committed the above errors should admit their mistakes to the masses, accept the criticism of the masses, and must correct them in action. The bad Party members and bad cadres in the countryside should be distinguished according to their class nature. Some are landlord elements, rich peasant elements, and rogue elements who have taken the opportunity to infiltrate the Party. These are disguised opportunists and should have their Party membership suspended, investigated, and those who should be expelled should be expelled, and those who should be punished should be punished, without any leniency. Some are Party members and cadres from peasant backgrounds, and their mistakes are also different. Some are selfish and self-interested, obtaining more fruits, or even becoming corrupt and degenerating, forgetting their roots. Those who have forgotten their roots must return the fruits they have over-occupied, correct their mistakes, and be subject to the criticism and punishment of the masses. Some are forcing orders and alienating themselves from the masses in order to complete work tasks. This is making mistakes for the public good. Due to our leadership's bureaucracy, there was no education beforehand and a lack of inspection afterward. We should share the responsibility for their mistakes, but bad work styles should also be corrected. We call on all Party members and cadres who have made mistakes to stand on the position of the Party and the people, sincerely accept criticism, accept punishment, resolutely correct their mistakes, and implement the task of equal land distribution. As long as you admit your mistakes to the masses, return the fruits, bow your heads to the people, and declare that you will obey the people and obey the Party from now on, the people and the Party will still want you, and will treat you warmly, help you correct your mistakes, and continue to serve the people as farmhands. You must not be incited by the landlords and rich peasants to stand on their position and oppose your own brothers, causing internal disunity, which will be very unfavorable to you. Therefore, the Central Bureau reiterates the decision of last May that all Party members should be open to the public and be reviewed and evaluated by the masses. Every Party member should bravely accept the review and evaluation of the masses, and should especially humbly accept the opinions and criticisms of the poor and hired masses. All Party members and cadres who have distributed more or forcibly occupied the fruits of struggle of the masses should unconditionally and quickly return all of them to the masses, and cannot destroy or waste them because they want to return them to the masses. If they destroy or waste them, they will be severely punished. Rectifying the Party ranks is to better serve the people and to ensure that the task of thoroughly distributing land equally can be smoothly completed and that the poor and hired can be completely liberated.

　　In the upcoming movement to implement the review of land reform and equal land distribution, the Central Bureau calls on every Party member to: (1) resolutely implement the "Outline Land Law," and must not have any words or actions that violate the "Outline Land Law"; (2) obey all resolutions and policies of the Party, and must not disobey or make independent moves against the Party; (3) obey all resolutions of the poor peasant leagues, farmers' associations, and peasant representative conferences, and must not disobey, and must wholeheartedly serve the people as farmhands, and must not make independent moves against the masses; (4) when distributing land and property equally, Party members must not distribute more or forcibly occupy; (5) Party members must not protect their own families and relatives, and must not protect the families of soldiers, cadres, and martyrs. Party members who commit crimes should be handed over to the people's court for trial, and leading organs at all levels must not protect them because they are Party members; (6) cherish the fruits of the land struggle, cherish public property, and must not have any destructive or wasteful behavior; (7) the whole Party must unite, unite the peasants, and contact the masses, and must not take any retaliatory actions against the peasants, must not provoke internal unity among the peasants, stir up trouble, and must not participate in the internal sectarian struggles of the peasants; (8) firmly rely on the poor peasants, consolidate the alliance with the middle peasants, consult with the masses on all matters, follow the mass line, and must not be passive and laissez-faire, force orders, or substitute for them; (9) promote the "Outline Land Law," and must not take a liberal attitude; (10) be honest and truthful, seek truth from facts, and must not make false reports, false instructions, be double-dealing, or take a two-faced attitude. Anyone who violates the above ten regulations will be severely punished by the Party and will be judged by the people.

　　Comrades! Our Communist Party is the party of the proletariat, and every Party member must serve the people wholeheartedly at all times, and serve as farmhands for the people. Our Party members must be with the peasants and lead them in carrying out land reform, and every Party member must be a good farmhand in this movement. If you have not been a good farmhand in the past, you must work hard in the future and be a good farmhand.

### 中国共产党晋冀鲁豫中央局　告全体党员书

　　中国共产党晋冀鲁豫中央局
  　告全体党员书同志们：
    去年双十节，我党中央颁布了中国土地法大纲。十月到十二月中央局召开了全区土地会议，进行了严格的批评和自我批评，坚决反对了地主富农思想、流氓思想和洋化忘本思想，全体一致衷心拥护并准备坚决执行中国土地法大纲。在将开始的全区复查土地改革、彻底平分土地的运动中，我们要依靠贫农，巩固的联合中农，消灭封建性及半封建性剥削的土地制度，满足无地少地农民的要求。做到人人有地种、有房住、有饭吃、有衣穿，使广大贫苦农民彻底翻身，起来当家作主。我们共产党员应坚决执行中国土地法大纲，遇事与农民商量，好好的与农民研究彻底平分土地办法，领导全体农民起来实现这个大纲，达到农民的彻底翻身。
    我们边区土地改革运动，已经进行了两年多。有些地区做的比较彻底，不少共产党员在土地改革运动中表现很模范，做到斗争英勇在前，分果实礼让在后，不占分毫便宜，与群众分得一样。在领导斗争中做到从贫雇出发，照顾贫雇利益，巩固的联合中农，遇事与群众商量，走群众路线，群众不酝酿成熟不自己行动；他们不强迫命令，对少数人不顾大体的偏激行为，他们能耐心说服，不尾巴主义。他们老老实实为人民当长工，不居功，不骄傲，他们当长工当得很好。他们与群众自始至终密切连系，群众十分爱护他们。但不少地区还搞得不彻底，甚至还很不彻底。即土地改革进行得比较彻底的地区，也还有土地财物分得不公道的弊病。譬如：地主富农出身的党员，包庇自己的家庭及亲友；领导机关部队和团体听了地主富农片面之词，上了地主富农的当，当了地主富农的“防空洞”。有的党员在土地改革中，自私自利，多分果实，甚至强占窃取了群众的果实，分的土地、房屋、衣服、牲口、家具等又多又好。特别有不少党员作风十分不好，站在人民头上，作威作福，不服从群众多数的意见，强迫命令，独断独行，完全是国民党老爷作风，打通思想，是“干部打，群众通”，互相包庇，“你拥我的护，我撑你的腰”。不少坏党员坏干部已成为反人民的小集团，“一窝蜂，动不得”，与负雇作对，与人民为敌，脱离群众，人民对他们很不满意。贫雇分的土地、房屋、衣服、牲口、家具等又少又坏，甚至有的贫雇，直到今天还没有地种，没有房子住，没有衣服穿，在农村中没有发言权，更谈不到政府、农会里办事。过去贫雇受地主阶级的剥削，今天则受这一部分坏党员坏干部的压迫。党内这样不纯洁，有了这些坏党员坏干部压在农民头上，贫雇怎能彻底翻身？中农怎能巩固团结？封建怎能彻底消灭？土地怎能彻底平分？在今后复查土地改革、平分土地的运动中，所有犯了上述错误的共产党员，都应该向群众承认错误，接受群众的批评，且必须在行动中切实纠正。农村中的坏党员坏干部，从其阶级本质上看，应该加以区别，有的是地主分子、富农分子、流氓分子乘机钻进党内来的，这是伪装的投机分子，应一律停止党籍，进行审查，该开除的开除，该处分的处分，决不准稍有姑息。有的是农民出身的党员和干部，他们的错误亦有所不同。其中有些是自私自利，多得果实，甚或贪污蜕化，忘了本。这些忘了本的分子，多占果实必须退出，所犯错误必须纠正，一任群众批评发落。其中有些则是为了完成工作任务而强迫命令脱离群众，这是为公而犯了错误，由于我们领导上的官僚主义，事前没有教育，事后缺乏检查，他们犯了错误，我们应该分担责任，但不好的作风亦应纠正。我们号召所有犯错误的党员和干部，站在党和人民的立场上，诚恳的接受批评，接受处分，坚决改正错误，贯彻平分土地的任务。只要你们向群众承认错误，退还果实，向人民低头，声明今后服从人民服从党，人民和党还是要你们的，并热情相待，帮助你们改正错误，继续为人民当长工。你们决不要受地主富农的挑拨离间，站在地主富农的立场上，去反对自己的弟兄，使内部不团结，那将对你们是十分不利的。因此，中央局再重申去年五月决定，党员一律公开，由群众来审查鉴定。每个党员应该勇敢的来接受群众的审查鉴定，特别应该虚心接受贫雇群众的意见和批评。所有党员和干部多分或强占群众的斗争果实，应无条件的迅速的全部退还群众，不能因为要退还群众就破坏浪费，如果破坏浪费，要受到严厉处分。把党的队伍整顿好，是为着更好的为人民服务，使彻底平分土地任务能顺利完成，使贫雇能彻底翻身。
    在今后贯彻复查土地改革平分土地运动中，中央局号召每个党员要做到：（一）坚决执行土地法大纲，不得有任何违反土地法大纲的言论和行动；（二）要服从党的一切决议和政策，不得违抗，不得向党闹独立性；（三）要服从贫农团、农会及农代会的一切决议，不得违抗，要全心全意为人民当长工，不得向群众闹独立性；（四）在平分土地财物时，党员不得多分或强占；（五）党员不得包庇本家本姓及其亲友，不得包庇军干烈属，党员犯罪应交人民法庭审判，各级领导机关不得因系党员加以包庇；（六）要爱惜土地斗争果实，爱惜公产公物，不得有任何破坏浪费行为；（七）全党团结，团结农民，联系群众，不得对农民采取任何报复行为，不得挑拨农民内部团结，招是惹非，不得参加农民内部宗派斗争；（八）要紧紧依靠贫农，巩固的联合中农，凡事要与群众商量，走群众路线，不得消极放任，强迫命令或代替包办；（九）要宣传土地法大纲，不得抱自由主义态度；（十）要忠诚老实，实事求是，不得作假报告，假指示，阳奉阴违，两面态度。谁要违犯以上十项规定，就要受到党的严厉制裁，就要受到人民的裁判。
    同志们！我们共产党是无产阶级的政党，每个党员要时时刻刻全心全意为人民服务，给人民当长工。我们党员要同农民在一道并领导农民进行土地改革，每个党员在此次运动中一定要当一个好长工。过去没当好，今后要努力，一定要当好。
