　　Nanquan Village Production for Half a Month
　　Poor and Hired Laborers Earn Seven Dou of Rice Each
    [Changzhi News] Since the final accounting last month in Nanquan Village, Fifth District, mutual aid teams have been reorganized based on the principle of voluntary association among the masses. Men, women, old, and young are all energized for winter production. Recently, due to the high price of rice, the masses saw that although they were earning a lot of money, it was effectively less when converted to rice, as the price of rice had almost doubled. Production enthusiasm was somewhat low, and they wanted to take a break. Cadres discovered this thinking and sought to boost morale by summarizing the achievements of the recent half-month of production. Of the entire village, excluding 26 households targeted for struggle, 117 poor and hired labor households and 53 middle peasant households participated in mutual aid production. In the past half-month, 15 head of livestock earned 900,000 yuan in transport, 13 people carrying loads and pushing carts earned 400,750 yuan, 31 people working in iron smelting and kilns earned 375,000 yuan, 9 people boiling saltpeter earned 135,000 yuan, 10 people working in flour mills, oil mills, and other workshops earned a total of 186,000 yuan, and 6 cotton ginners and carpenters earned 136,000 yuan. Five large and small cooperatives earned a total of 485,000 yuan. 203 women, full and part-time laborers, spun a total of 6,860 catties of cotton, earning 880,000 yuan. The total earned in the half-month was 3,490,000 yuan. 156 poor and hired men and women earned 2,935,000 yuan, averaging 18,800 yuan per person. 86 middle peasants earned 556,250 yuan, averaging 6,468 yuan per person. (Why do middle peasants benefit less than poor and hired laborers? Please answer. – Editor) After this concrete accounting, the masses saw that as long as they worked hard, the profits were still substantial. They all said: Even if rice is expensive, we must produce; the faster rice rises, the faster we earn. Branch Secretary Meng Shuzhi said: We are getting more benefits because of voluntary association and the poor being in power; in half a month, poor and hired laborers can buy seven dou of rice each. Elderly peasant Pei Qingtai said excitedly: As long as we listen to the Communist Party and produce well, we will all have a good life.

　　南泉庄生产半个月
  　贫雇每人赚米七斗
    【长治消息】五区南泉庄自上月总结算帐后，在群众自愿结合的原则下，重新整顿了互助组，男女老少进行冬季生产，都起了劲。最近因米价高涨，群众看到赚钱虽不少，因为米价涨了几乎一倍，合起米来就少了。生产情绪有些低落，想要歇一歇。干部发现了这种思想，从总结最近的半月生产成绩中来提高情绪。全村除二十六户斗争对象外，有一百一十七户贫雇，五十三户中农都参加了互助生产，在最近半月内，牲口十五头运输赚洋九十万元，一十三人担挑、推车赚洋四十万零七千五百元，三十一人打铁下窑，赚洋三十七万五千元，九人熬硝赚洋十三万五千元，十人干粉坊、油坊等作坊共赚洋十八万六千元，弹花工人、木工六人赚洋十三万六千元，大小合作社五座，共赚洋四十八万五千元。纺织妇女全半辅劳力二百零三人，共纺花六千八百六十斤，赚洋八十八万元。以上半月共赚洋三百四十九万元。贫雇男女一百五十六人，赚洋二百九十三万五千元，每人平均一万八千八百元。中农八十六个，赚洋五十五万六千二百五十元，每人平均六千四百六十八元。（中农得利较贫雇少两倍，是什么原因？请答复。——编者）经过这次具体算帐，群众都看到只要努力生产，红利还是很大。都说：米贵了也要生产，米快涨咱快赚。支书孟树只说：咱们得到利多亏了自愿结合，穷人当权了；半月得利，贫雇每人能买七斗米。贫农裴清太老汉很兴奋的说：只要听上共产党好好生产都要过好时光。（双虎、诚良、南泉庄通讯组）
