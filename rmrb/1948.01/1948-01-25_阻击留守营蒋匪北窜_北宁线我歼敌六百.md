Xinhua News Agency, Jidong, 23rd: The section of the Beining Railway between Qinhuangdao and Luanhe has remained closed since it was severely sabotaged by our forces in early December last year. The 56th Division of the Kuomintang's 92nd Army, attempting to reinforce the Northeast, was also blocked in the Liushouying area of Changli. On the 17th, the bandits, with the 168th Regiment providing cover, attempted to flee north, departing from Liushouying Station and proceeding in a tortoise-like pace for about fifteen li. In the vicinity of Shengtieying, they were met head-on by a fierce attack from our local troops. After eighteen hours of intense fighting, four infantry companies and one machine gun/artillery company of the enemy were annihilated, and the remaining bandits retreated in disarray. It is estimated that more than 230 enemies, including Battalion Commander Liu Shuangxi, were killed or wounded, and 377 were captured, including Battalion Commander Zhang Bailu. The captured items included one anti-tank gun, two mortars, six 60mm mortars, thirty-one light and heavy machine guns, two hundred and fourteen rifles of various types, sixteen rifle grenade launchers, and some other military supplies. On the 13th, 15th, and 17th, our other units destroyed three sections of the railway between Tangfang and Lutai.
