　　【Taiyue News】The Tunliu First District convened a conference of all village cadres, cooperative managers, and representatives of hired and poor peasants on the 3rd, to inspect winter production work. 423 people attended. The inspection revealed that the production difficulties of poor peasants and hired laborers had not been resolved. A cadre from Gaodian Village said: "Oil mills and flour mills have been opened, but poor and hired peasants cannot afford to buy shares. For example, Zhang Yutang's family, a rich peasant, invested five shi [a unit of dry measure], while Chen Dexing, a poor peasant, only invested five dou [a smaller unit of dry measure] this autumn. The cooperative has been operating for more than a year, but who is really benefiting?" A cadre from Dongjia Village said: "The Farmers' Association has an oil press, and the poor and hired peasants want to run an oil mill, but they can't afford the capital. The donkeys that were confiscated during the struggle are being sold cheaply for cash, but the poor peasants don't have cash, so they can't afford to buy them even at a low price. The wealthy are taking advantage of this." A cadre from Wei Village said: "Our village opened a flour mill. After checking this year, only three poor and hired peasant families have bought shares. Who do you think this is for?" After discussion and self-criticism, everyone realized that the past claims that winter production had been fully launched were unrealistic, and that so many hired and poor peasants simply could not produce. Therefore, everyone must go back and help the hired and poor peasants solve some of their production difficulties.

　　屯留一区检查生产
  　贫雇困难仍没解决
    【太岳消息】屯留一区在三日召集全区村干部合作社经理和雇贫代表大会，检查冬季生产工作。到会四百廿三人。检查中发现贫雇农生产困难还未解决。高店村干部说：“开了油坊、粉坊，雇贫入不起股，象富农张玉堂一家就入了五石，贫农陈德星今年秋天才入了五斗。合作社开办了一年多，这样倒底谁沾了光？”东贾村干部说：“农会有油碾一套，雇贫农要闹油坊，可是拿不起本钱。斗争出的驴贱价出卖，要现钱，贫农没现钱，贱价也买不起。都叫有钱的讨了便宜。”魏村干部说：“俺村开粉坊，今年检查一下，只有三家贫雇入股，你说这是给谁干的。”经过检讨，大家才弄清楚过去说冬季生产都搞开了是不实在的，还有这么多的雇贫根本没法生产，所以大家回去要好好帮助雇贫解决生产上一些困难。
