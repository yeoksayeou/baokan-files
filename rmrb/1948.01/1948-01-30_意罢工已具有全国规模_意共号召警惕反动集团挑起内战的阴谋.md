　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Rome dispatch: Recent Italian "strikes and demonstrations have risen to a national scale" (TASS). Unemployed workers in Florence, one of the world's largest art centers, held a massive demonstration on the 22nd, demanding improved living standards. In response to the police's unreasonable violence against the demonstrators, the working people of Florence province and its surrounding 49 towns, under the call of the trade union, announced a general strike starting on the 23rd. The Gasperi government was forced to accept the workers' demands, and the strike was declared victorious on the 24th. The city's working people held a celebration rally of tens of thousands of people. Bitossi, the secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, paid tribute to the Italian working people for their solidarity during the strike. Unemployed workers in Milan also held a large demonstration on the 22nd, forcing the reactionary government to concede and allocate 2.5 billion lire to reduce unemployment. In addition, demonstrations demanding "a 40-hour work week to reduce unemployment" have occurred continuously in Turin, Airona, Pisa, Livorno, Naples, and other cities. Turin recently held demonstrations against high prices. Strike events have erupted in Brescia (Sabbath Province), Sesto, Garonti, Lezgio, and Emilia. 100,000 bank employees across the country had just resumed work on the 13th, but due to the reactionary authorities' breach of contract, they announced a general strike again on the 23rd.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: According to TASS Rome dispatch of the 26th: The Italian Communist Party recently issued a special communique regarding the first meeting of the party's leading organs in Rome after the Sixth National Congress, stating: "The Communist Party's leading organs discussed the domestic political situation, pointing out that the authorities' planned provocative actions have aroused increasing vigilance among the democratic working masses. The Gasperi government's use of violence against the legitimate demonstrations of working people and the unemployed has created a tense atmosphere, thereby delaying the election campaign. This proves that the reactionary groups of the ruling class are trying to worsen the political situation as much as possible, and to provoke events of civil war in order to disrupt the elections. The party calls on the people of the whole country to be vigilant against these reactionary plots, and declares that the party will do its utmost to defend the freedom stipulated in the constitution, so as not to suffer any destruction, and to protect the rights of the working people to seek work, wages, and security according to their own interests."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: TASS Rome dispatch of the 23rd: The General Secretary of the Italian Socialist Party, Bassou, pointed out in his report at the 26th party congress that the party has become stronger and saved because the divisive elements within the party were purged at last year's congress (referring to the Saragat reactionaries). He said: "After we successfully opposed the splitters, we have been able to prove that only through the left-wing line can the unity of democratic forces be achieved." Bassou strongly stated that the Socialist and Communist parties must unite their forces to fight for a common cause. After exposing that "the threat of fascism exists in the Christian Democratic Party's cabinet," he emphasized that "there is no such thing as a third force. There are currently only two paths: either allow the reactionary policies leading to a new war to continue, or take the path of the people's democratic front towards the victory of a new democracy." He said: "We must unite all those who are currently fighting for the fundamental reform of our society. This will be the touchstone of both our maturity and the fight for our right to exist." Bassou concluded by shouting: "The time has come to step out of our party's small circle and into the struggle waged by the working masses."

　　意罢工已具有全国规模
  　意共号召警惕反动集团挑起内战的阴谋
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】罗马讯：最近意大利“罢工及示威浪潮之高涨，已具有全国性的规模。”（塔斯社）世界最大艺术中心之一的佛罗伦萨城的失业工人，于二十二日曾举行巨大示威游行，要求改善生活水平。为回答警察对示威者的无理行凶，佛罗伦萨省市及其附近的四十九个城镇的劳动人民，在工会号召下宣布于二十三日起总罢工。加斯贝利政府被迫接受了工人们的要求，罢工因此于二十四日宣布胜利结束。该市劳动人民并为此举行了数万人的庆祝胜利大会。意总工会书记比托西，在会上向在罢工期间表现团结一致的意劳动人民致敬。米兰失业工人也于二十二日举行了大示威，迫使反动政府让步同意拨款二十五亿里拉以减少失业。此外，要求“每周四十小时工作以减少失业”的示威，在都尔、艾隆纳、比萨、里窝那、那不勒斯等城连续发生。都灵最近也举行了反对物价高涨的示威。布立霞（属萨巴第省）、塞索、加隆地、勒佐及爱米里亚等地都爆发了罢工事件。全国十万银行员工，刚于十三日复工，但因反动当局之毁约，又于二十三日宣布大罢工。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据塔斯社罗马二十六日电：意共顷发表关于六大以后该党领导机关在罗马的首次会议的特别公报，略称：“共产党领导机关讨论了国内政治形势，指出：当局有计划的挑衅行为，在民主的劳苦大众中已引起日益增长的警觉。加斯贝利政府利用暴行以反对劳动人民和失业者的合法示威，造成紧张的气氛，借此拖延选举运动。这证明统治阶级的反动集团力图使政治形势尽可能的恶化，并为了破坏选举而挑起内战的事变。本党号召全国人民警惕这些反动阴谋，并声明本党将竭尽全力以保卫宪法所规定的自由，俾免遭受任何破坏，并按照劳动人民的切身利益，保障他们有着求得工作、工资、和安全之权利”。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社罗马二十三日讯：意社会党总书记巴苏，在该党二十六届大会上作报告时指出：该党由于去年上届大会清洗了党内分裂分子（按指萨拉盖特反动派）而更为强大，并因此而得救。他说：“我们胜利地反对了分裂者之后，我们已能证明，只有经由左的路线，才能获得民主力量的团结”。巴苏力称社、共二党必须团结其力量，为共同的事业而斗争。巴苏在揭露“法西斯主义的威胁存在于基督教民主党的内阁中”后，即强调“第三种力量那种东西并不存在。目前只有二条路：或者是让导向新战争的反动政策继续下去，或者是沿人民民主阵线道路走向新民主的胜利”。他说：“我们必须联合目前一切为我国社会的基本改革而奋斗的人们。这将是我们成熟的程度和争取我们生存权利两者的试金石”。巴苏最后高呼：“走出我党的小圈子，到劳苦大众所进行的斗争当中去的时候，已经来到了”。
