Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Shanghai report: After our counter-offensive armies from the two routes of Hubei, Henan, Anhui, and Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei penetrated deep into western Hubei and southern Shaanxi, approaching the northeastern border of Sichuan, the popular uprising armed forces in the Micang Mountain area of ​​Nanjiang, Tongjiang, Bazhong, Cangxi, Guangyuan, and the southern area of ​​the Motian Ridge, Jiangyou, Jiange, Pingwu, Beichuan, and Maoxian became more active. Poor peasants rebelled under the slogans of resisting grain, resisting conscription, resisting taxes, and opposing local tyrants. Chiang Kai-shek's Chongqing headquarters was extremely panicked and hurriedly convened a "Military and Political Conference of Southwest Provinces." Chiang Kai-shek's Sichuan Provincial Government also held a "Defense Conference of Fifteen Counties in Northeastern Sichuan", established a "Military Commission of Sichuan Province" and three garrison headquarters in eastern Sichuan, western Sichuan, and Chengdu, and ordered all counties to attack the popular uprising armed forces regardless of region. Chongqing also plans to set up a "Huarong Mountain Suppression Command Post." In the Dabashan area on the border of Sichuan and Shaanxi, known as the gateway to Sichuan Province, Chiang Kai-shek's troops are even more alarmed. Chiang Kai-shek's Fourth and Sixth Security Brigades of Sichuan Province have been sent to defend. Nine counties including Bazhong and Jiange have established a "Joint Command", and four counties, Wanyuan, Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Bazhong, have also established a "Joint Defense Military Office." All counties are also mobilizing laborers to build bunkers and repair roads, and the people are full of complaints. In addition, according to a Tianjin newspaper report in mid-month: Chiang Kai-shek has specially dispatched a squadron of American-made bombers to Sichuan due to the expansion of the scope of popular uprisings.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: According to a Tianjin newspaper report on the 20th of this month: Luo Rihui's popular uprising armed forces are active in Qiubei, Guangyi, Xingyi, Anlong, Xijiang, Xilin and other counties on the border of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. Chiang Kai-shek's Southwest Chongqing Headquarters was extremely panicked and urgently ordered the Chiang Kai-shek authorities of the three provinces to establish a "Joint Defense Command" in an attempt to "suppress" the popular uprising armed forces there. In addition, a popular uprising armed force of more than 1,000 in southwestern Guangxi arrived near Longjin (Longzhou). The Chiang Kai-shek authorities in Guangxi Province had no troops to deploy and could only send local militias to resist, which was extremely anxious.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: According to Chiang Kai-shek's district report: The popular uprising armed forces in Yunnan are extremely active recently. In Kaiyuan, Gejiu, Jianshui, Shiping, and nearby Pingbian counties along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Gejiu-Bisezhai branch line, there are popular uprising armed forces led by Xu Shihao, Long Yonghe, Bai Zhenggui, Bai Xiaoqi, and Xiong Shanzheng, with a total of more than 1,000 people and guns. They have won victories in counter-"suppression" this month. Xiong's troops once entered Pingbian County on October 27, parading in the streets and demonstrating, without committing any crimes against citizens and merchants. Chiang Kai-shek's government was extremely panicked and dared not intervene.
