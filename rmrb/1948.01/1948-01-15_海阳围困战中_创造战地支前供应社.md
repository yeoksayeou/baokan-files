Xinhua News Agency, East China, 12th. During the Haiyang siege, the support-the-front supply cooperatives organized in various districts near the battlefield created a new form of wartime supply that benefited both the military and the people, enabling timely solutions to the needs of the troops and facilitating purchases by the masses, stabilizing wartime prices. The cooperative was formed by a working group composed of the county government's Industry and Commerce Section, the Chamber of Commerce, and shops, under the unified leadership of the county's Support-the-Front Office. The original district-level cooperative was the central cooperative, and village support-the-front supply cooperatives were established by organizing the capital of various village cooperatives and merchants. Each district reported market conditions and inventory numbers daily for mutual adjustment, exchanging surplus goods for those in short supply. Items that were difficult to procure were wholesaled by supplier shops to the central cooperatives. The central cooperatives retained a portion and then distributed the rest to the village supply cooperatives at the original price. Locally produced items were purchased by the village supply cooperatives, distributed among households, and concentrated as needed. In this way, even though they were ten or twenty li away from the front line, aerial clearing was not affected. If troops were stationed in villages with cooperatives, the cooperatives served as the natural supply cooperative. If the supply could not meet the demand, adjustments were made at the central cooperative. The central cooperative headquarters were mostly located in the rear of the troops. Due to the establishment of this type of supply cooperative, during the siege of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Haiyang last year, cellophane noodles fell from 1,500 yuan to 1,200 yuan per catty, kerosene fell from 2,400 yuan to 2,000 yuan per catty, and the prices of other items remained stable.

### 海阳围困战中　创造战地支前供应社

　　海阳围困战中
  　创造战地支前供应社
    【新华社华东十二日电】海阳围困战中，战地附近各区组织之支前供应社，曾创造了军民两利的战时供应新形式，使部队所需能及时得到解决，并便利群众购买，稳定战时物价。该社由县府实业科、商会、商店联合组成工作组，统一在县支前办事处的领导下，以原区联社为中心社，并组织各村合作社及商人的资本，成立村支前供应社。各区每天汇报行情及存货数目，以便互相调剂，以货物剩余部分换回不足部分。不易采办之物品，由供应商店批发给各中心社，除中心社留一部分外，再按原价发给村供应社。当地出产的物品，由村供应社买好，分散在各户，随要随集中。这样虽离火线一、二十里，亦不影响空中清野。如部队住在有合作社的村庄，合作社即为当然供应社。如供不应求，即到中心社调剂。中心社社址大都设于部队后方所在地。由于这种供应社的建立，在去年海阳蒋匪被围期间，粉条由每斤一千五百元落至一千二百元，火油由每斤两千四百元落至二千元，其他物品，均保持原价。
