Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 20th. Our guerrilla force on the night of the 12th, in one fell swoop, attacked Lancun, a fortified stronghold of the Yan bandits, thirty li northwest of Taiyuan. This place is one of the industrial centers of the Yan bandits, with a paper mill and an electric light company, surrounded by dense power grids, and garrisoned by a battalion of the Japanese-Yan jointly compiled "Shanxi Field Army." Our guerrillas rushed into the bandit army's garrison, immediately eliminating an enemy company headquarters and a squad, capturing seven bandits and killing three. They seized seven light machine guns, two light cannons, and other weapons.
