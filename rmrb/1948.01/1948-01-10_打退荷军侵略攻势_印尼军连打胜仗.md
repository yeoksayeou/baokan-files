Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. A comprehensive report from Batavia and Yogyakarta: On the eve of the New Year, the Indonesian army frequently reported victories, frustrating the Dutch aggressors' military conspiracy to concentrate four divisions at the beginning of last month in a vain attempt to capture Yogyakarta and Solo. According to reports from the Indonesian "Liberation Daily" and other sources: Since the 29th of last month, the Indonesian army has repeatedly repelled the Dutch army's aggressive offensive in Salatiga, Demak and other places in Central Java. At the same time, the Dutch-occupied areas are facing powerful sabotage and encirclement warfare by Indonesian guerrillas. Indonesian guerrillas in West Java have successfully driven out the Dutch defense forces in nine regions and cut off the railway line between Bogor and Yogyakarta. The activities of the Indonesian guerrillas have even approached the suburbs of Batavia. Fierce battles have now broken out around Batavia and in Tangkilong, 24 kilometers from Batavia.
