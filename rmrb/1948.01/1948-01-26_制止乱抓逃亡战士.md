　　Stopping the Random Arrest of Deserting Soldiers
    Last December, the × Column's rear service office wrote a letter of introduction to Lingchuan to find deserting soldiers to return to the team. The rear service office requested the government to order district and village cadres to be responsible. The government agreed and strictly ordered the entire county to do this work in a concentrated manner. At that time, the main cadres of the Gujiao District were not present, and Duan Chengzhi of the × Column's rear service office himself mobilized Niu Lianzhong, a third-class demobilized soldier (currently the manager of the cooperative), in Shangshanghe Village, Gujiao District, to return to the team. Niu Lianzhong was unwilling to go, and Duan Chengzhi beat Lianzhong until he couldn't move. In Hengshui District, a demobilized soldier returned from the sub-district, and they insisted on taking him back in less than ten days. Only after many people spoke up was he allowed to stay. In Gujiao District, a military dependent's son came back to visit relatives, and Duan Chengzhi insisted on taking him. The comrade quickly ran back to his original unit, and Duan Chengzhi beat the military dependent everywhere with a stick, saying that he shouldn't have been taken away. When they find demobilized or retired soldiers, they ask, "Do you have a demobilization certificate?" Once people take it out, they don't give it back. They arrest the retired soldiers and take them to the rear service headquarters. The retired soldiers ask the rear service office for their certificates, but the rear service office says they have been handed over to the higher authorities and won't give them back. They also exchange the new clothes that people wear at home for old and torn ones and send them back without paying travel expenses. Now the administrative office has ordered that no random arrests are allowed without an order from the major military region. It is hoped that the troops will be informed not to arrest people indiscriminately. If there are deserting soldiers, it is hoped that the county and district governments will organize mobilization to stabilize the emotions of retired soldiers and reassure them in their production. (Lian Chuanfang)
    To mobilize deserting soldiers to return to the team, the troops should go through a certain organization and ask the local party and government organs to handle it in a planned and unified manner. The troops directly taking action will inevitably hinder social order and cause unrest among retired soldiers, which cannot be allowed and should be stopped immediately. As for beating people and exchanging and stripping clothes..., these are even more illegal acts. It is hoped that the × Column's rear service office will conduct an in-depth inspection and correction, and it should be noted whether some bad people are causing trouble.

　　制止乱抓逃亡战士
    去年十二月，×纵队留守处写一介绍信来陵川找逃亡战士归队，留守处要求政府命令区村干部负责。政府答应了，严令全县都突击做这工作。当时古郊区主要干部不在，×纵队留守处的段成志自己在古郊区上上河村动员三等荣退军人牛连中（现任合作社经理）归队。牛连中不愿去，段成志就把连中打的不能动了。横水区一个荣退军人从分区退伍回来，不到十天，又非叫他去不行。经好多人说才算是留下了。古郊区有军属儿子回来探亲，段成志非叫他去不行，该同志赶快跑回原部队，段成志拿着棍到处打这个军属，说不该叫走了。他们找着退伍或荣退军人，就问你有退伍证没有？人家一拿出来，就不给人家了。他们把荣退军人都抓到留守总处，荣退军人和留守处要证，但留守处说交了上级，不给人家，并将人家在家穿的新衣服换成破的，不发路费放回来。现在行署有命令：没有大军区命令不准乱抓。希转告该部队不要乱抓，如有逃亡战士，希经县区政府有组织的动员，使荣退军人稳定情绪，安心生产。（连传芳）
    动员逃亡战士归队，部队应该经过一定组织，请地方党政机关有计划的统一处理。部队直接下手，必然会妨碍社会秩序，引起荣退军人不安，这是不能允许的，应该立刻制止。至于打人、换剥衣服……，更是犯法的行为，希望×纵留守处深入检查纠正，并应注意是不是有些坏人从中捣鬼。
