Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 26th—Of the 400,000 disaster victims in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region who have suffered the most from the Chiang Kai-shek-caused disaster, 100,000 are on the verge of starvation, and another 100,000 are surviving on bran and other substitutes. Chairman Lin of the Border Region Government is leading governments at all levels to carry out disaster relief with the greatest effort, putting forward the slogan of fighting "to not let a single person starve to death." Chairman Lin pointed out with indignation that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has suffered inhumane destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, resulting in a serious disaster. A large number of young men were taken away and killed by the enemy. The area of cultivated land has been reduced by 20% to 30%. Over 500,000 mu of seedlings have been trampled, over 150,000 jin of cotton have been lost, over 140,000 trees have been lost, over 170,000 pigs and sheep have been lost, over 65,000 head of cattle, donkeys, and horses have been lost, 230,000 pieces of farm implements have been destroyed, and over 47,000 spinning machines have been destroyed. Chairman Lin emphasized that disaster relief is the most urgent task at present. Disaster relief should be the priority in areas with particularly severe disasters. Disaster relief should be combined with land reform, and the grain confiscated from landlords and requisitioned from rich peasants should be quickly distributed to local disaster victims as their due fruits of struggle. We have already carried out emergency adjustments in some areas. We have allocated 500 shi of public grain from Zhidan County to relieve Zizhou, Hengshan, Zhenchuan, and other counties, and are transporting 5,000 shi of public grain from the Longdong sub-region to distribute to Zizhou, Jingbian, Hengshan, Zichang, Anse, and other counties. Grain is also continuing to be transported from Jin-Sui and other areas, some of which has been given to Sui, Mi, Jia, and other counties. Chairman Lin called on all counties, districts, and villages to make adjustments at any time. Party members and cadres' families with grain reserves should enthusiastically donate or lend them to disaster victims, and buy large quantities of grain from grain-producing areas and transport it to grain-deficient areas for sale at fair prices. Fifty thousand jin of cotton should be quickly distributed to women in disaster areas. Chairman Lin also pointed out that due to suffering from cold and hunger caused by the Chiang disaster, epidemics have occurred in some areas of Jia County and around Panlong Yongping. The government has sent medical teams to provide treatment. In addition, all regions should plan immigration according to specific conditions, organize production and transportation, practice strict economy, and cherish people's labor and resources. Only by forming disaster relief work into a mass movement can we overcome difficulties. Chairman Lin believes that the fraternal assistance of large quantities of grain, cotton, and cloth from other liberated areas has also become an important force for us to overcome the famine, and expresses deep gratitude to the great collectivist spirit of the people of Jin-Sui and other liberated areas for providing massive material assistance. Finally, Chairman Lin sternly reminded that in some disaster areas, Party and government workers at all levels have not seriously solved the hunger and cold problems of disaster victims, and in some non-disaster areas, they have not regarded this as an urgent task to be carried out. This attitude of turning a blind eye to the people's suffering is not worthy of being a good public servant of the people. The Northwest Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China also simultaneously issued a decision on disaster relief in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, specifically stipulating various emergency disaster relief measures.

　　陕甘宁急救蒋造灾荒
  　陇东等地拨粮五千石
    【新华社西北二十六日电】陕甘宁边区遭受蒋灾最重的四十万灾民中，目前已有十万人接近断炊，另有十万人以糠秕等代食品渡日。边府林主席正领导各级政府以最大力量进行救灾。提出为“不让饿死一个人”而斗争的口号。林主席痛愤指出边区遭受蒋胡匪帮惨无人性的破坏，造成严重灾情，大批壮丁被敌人拉走和杀害，耕地面积缩小了百分之二十至三十，青苗被践踏五十余万亩、棉花损失十五万余斤、树木损失十四万余株、猪羊损失十七万余只、牛驴马六万五千余头、农具被毁坏二十三万件、纺织机被毁四万七千余架。林主席强调指出救灾是目前紧急要务，灾情特别严重地区应以救灾第一，要把救灾与土改结合，把没收地主及征收富农长余粮食迅速分给当地灾民作为其应得的斗争果实。我们已在若干地区进行紧急调剂，曾从志丹县拨出五百石公粮救济子洲、横山、镇川等县，并正从陇东分区运出五千石公粮分配给子洲、靖边、横山、子长、安塞等县，晋绥等地亦继续运来粮食，其中一部分已给绥、米、葭等县。林主席号召各县区乡村之间，随时进行调剂，党员干部家庭有存粮，应首先踊跃捐助或借给灾民，并从产粮区大量买粮运至缺粮区实行平粜，五万斤棉花应迅速发给灾民妇女。林主席并提出由于遭受蒋灾挨冻受饿，在葭县部分地区及蟠龙永坪一带已发生流行疫病，政府已派医辽队前往救治。此外，各区按具体情况有计划的移民，组织生产运输，厉行节约，爱惜民力物力。只有把救灾工作形成群众性运动，我们就一定能够渡过困难。林主席认为其他兄弟解放区给予巨量粮食、棉花、布匹的友爱援助，也成为我们战胜灾荒的重要力量，对晋绥及其他解放区人民伟大集体主义精神，以巨量物质援助，表示深切感谢。最后林主席严厉提醒，在部分灾区，各级党政工作人员还没有认真去解决灾民的饿冻问题，而在有些非灾区也没有把这看作一项紧急任务去执行，这种对于人民灾难熟视无睹的态度，不配当人民的好长工。中共西北中央局亦同时发布关于陕甘宁边区救灾问题的决定，具体规定各项紧急救灾措施。
