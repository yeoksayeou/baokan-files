　　Landlords' Harsh Exploitation and Chiang-American Oppression
　　Sharp Decline in Agricultural Production in the Chiang Area
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd】Agricultural production in the Chiang-controlled areas plummeted in the past year. According to Chiang Kai-shek's spokesman, Dong Xian Guang, before the new year: the average wheat harvest in the entire Chiang area in 1947 was about 60%, with an estimated output of 21.5 million metric tons; the rice harvest was about 67%, with an estimated output of 48 million metric tons. According to estimates by "UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" and Chiang Kai-shek's Executive Yuan: agricultural production in 1946 decreased by about 8% to 12% compared with normal pre-war years; 1945 also decreased by only 17% compared with pre-war years; while in 1947, agricultural production in the Chiang area decreased by 33% to 40%. A Shanghai magazine in its December issue, when discussing the reasons for the decline in agricultural production in the Chiang area, pointed out: First, this is because under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, feudal relations of production have restricted the productive forces; less than 10% of landlords and rich peasants occupy 70% to 80% of the land in the entire Chiang area, while 90% of the peasants occupy only 20% to 30% of the land. The harsh exploitation by landlords and rich peasants forces the vast majority of peasants to be unable to continue farming or to leave the land. Second, it is also due to the (American) imperialism invading China and forming an alliance with the Chinese reactionary forces (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang), intensifying the oppression of peasants in the Chiang area, thus increasing the burden on peasants in the Chiang area. The magazine stated that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries have no power to solve the current food crisis in the Chiang area, saying: "The final solution to the (Chiang area) food problem depends on realizing the independent development of the national economy and on changing the existing relations of production to realize land reform where tillers own their land."
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd】According to Shanghai newspaper reports: The budgeted grain requisition amount of the Chiang bandits this year has increased greatly compared with last year. Last year, the Chiang bandits extorted 69.97 million *shi dan* of grain from the people under the names of "grain requisition" and "grain borrowing," while from August 1947 to July 1948, they plan to extract 80 million *shi dan* of grain. Moreover, the Chiang bandits' Ministry of Food announced at the beginning of last month that they would forcibly "add to the purchase" of 3 million large packages of "military rice" (equivalent to about 10 million *shi dan* of paddy rice) in Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei provinces at low prices; combined with the previous amount, it totals as many as 90 million *shi dan*.

　　地主苛刻剥削蒋美压榨
  　蒋区农业生产大减
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】过去一年蒋管区农业生产激降。据蒋匪发言人董显光年前供称：一九四七年全蒋区平均小麦收成约为六成，估计产量为二千一百五十万公吨；稻谷收成约为六成七，估计产量为四千八百万公吨。另据“联总”及蒋匪行总估计：一九四六年农业生产较战前正常年份约减少百分之八至百分之十二；一九四五年亦仅较战前减少百分之十七；而一九四七年蒋区农产竟减少百分之三十三至百分之四十。上海某杂志十二月号在论及蒋区农产减低之原因时指出：第一、这是由于在蒋介石统治下，封建的生产关系，束缚了生产力；不到百分之十的地主富农，占有全蒋区百分之七十至八十的土地，而百分和九十的农民仅占有百分之二十至三十的土地，地主富农的苛刻剥削，迫使广大农民不能继续维持耕作或离开土地。第二、还由于（美）帝国主义侵入中国，并与中国反动势力（按指蒋介石匪帮）结为一体，加紧压榨蒋区农民，因而加重了蒋区农民的负担。该杂志表示蒋介石反动派没有力量解决当前蒋区的粮食危机称：“（蒋区）粮食问题之最后解决，有赖于实现民族经济的独立发展，有赖于改变现存的生产关系，实现耕者有其田的土地改革”。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据沪报消息：本年度蒋匪征粮预算数额较去年大增。去年度蒋匪以“征实”、“征借”等名目向人民勒榨粮食六千九百九十七万市担，而一九四七年八月至一九四八年七月则预定榨取粮食八千万市担。且蒋匪粮食部又于上月初宣布：在四川、湖南及湖北三省用低价强迫“加购”“军米”三百万大包（约合稻谷一千万市担）；连前合计共达九千万市担之多。
