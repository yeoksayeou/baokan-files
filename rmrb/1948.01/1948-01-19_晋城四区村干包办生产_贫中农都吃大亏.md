[Taiyue News] In the fourth district of Jincheng, many villages have harmed the interests of poor and hired peasants and hindered and undermined winter production in the organization of winter production mutual aid. According to Comrade Fu Ting of Jincheng Bank, during a loan work investigation, he found that cadres' "collectivist" thinking and control ideology in production were very serious, and private production was not allowed, and it was forced to be collectivized. The result greatly harmed the interests of poor and hired peasants. For example, in Xiaoji Village, Youfangtou Village, etc., private shops were not allowed, and they were all contracted by cooperatives. The small shops opened by five hired poor families were forcibly closed, and the cooperative opened a large shop. Because there were few shops and many customers, the customers were sent to the homes of the people who originally opened small shops for accommodation, and the cooperative would go to collect the shop money the next day. The hired poor farmers angrily said: "We don't understand what this is called mutual aid." When these words reached the ears of the village cadres, they threatened the masses and said: "This is called selfless devotion to the public, do you want to get rich alone?" The masses had to swallow their anger and dare not ask any more questions. Dongling Village is a village-wide mutual aid, with more than 50 households in the village. Regardless of each other, all production is put together, including spinning, coal kilns, mills, and transportation. Work is not counted by work points, and there are no wages. All the money earned is collectivized, and dividends are not distributed in time. Middle and poor peasants are not satisfied, and their enthusiasm for production is not high. The middle peasants said: "We still don't know who we are running for! No matter how hard we work, we don't know how much dividends we will get." The poor peasants said: "We really can't afford it. We have been working all winter and haven't seen a penny." Three poor hired laborers in Buluo Village engaged in transportation and earned 120,000 yuan. The cadres said: "You can share 50,000 yuan, and 70,000 yuan will be collectivized!" The hired poor had no choice but to follow the cadres' instructions and collectivize 70,000 yuan. The coal kilns, carpentry, and restaurants operated by the Xiaoji Cooperative did not differentiate between skilled workers and apprentices, and were paid four liters of rice per day. Wages were not paid on time. Carpenter Han Fake said: "If we don't get paid for a day, our whole family will starve. The land is frozen, and we still can't wear cotton-padded clothes." The apprentices in the textile factory have already learned how to weave cloth, but they are not paid wages or provided with meals. Hai Zhou's mother said: "We really can't afford it. Our daughter-in-law is learning to weave cloth, and she doesn't earn a penny every day, and we have to send her food there every day." Elsewhere, it costs 800 yuan to spin a catty of cotton, but in Xiaoji it costs 600 yuan. The hired poor farmers said: "We earn less this way, and the cooperative earns more, but we don't have any shares in the cooperative, and we can't get dividends anyway, so we always suffer." Xiaoji sent ten long-term workers away from home in February last year, and they were stopped at home and not allowed to go out. Among them, there were four hired poor, two of whom had nothing to eat at the time, and begged the cadres several times to go out for a trip to earn some money, but the cadres did not allow it. Some cadres were selfish and unwilling to be in production with the hired poor peasants, fearing that they would suffer losses: Geng Changzi, the political director of Zuotang Street, convened a meeting of the masses and shouted to organize mutual aid for production, but after the meeting, he went to transport goods alone. He never asked whether the masses were producing or not. The cadres in Miaoxi Village all went out to produce, but the hired poor peasants sat at home and did nothing because they had no capital. The deputy of Zuojiang Village saw that the coal kiln was not making money, so he forced the masses to dig a coal kiln, but he went to run errands every day. The cadres of Xiaoji Village stipulated that livestock should be handed over to the cooperative for 200 yuan for one day of outside work. A full labor force should pay 100 yuan per day, and a semi-labor force should pay 50 yuan. This greatly reduced the enthusiasm for production. Especially the hired poor farmers who lacked money and livestock, and the money earned by labor was very limited. After deducting 100 yuan a day, they could not earn money and had to lose money, so they did not do it. Old man Guangshun said: "In other villages, you are punished for not working, but in our village, you are guilty of working." Because of this, more than 20 hired poor farmers in the village have not moved since winter production began.
    The above-mentioned things that lack a class stance have greatly harmed the interests of the hired poor peasants and hindered and undermined winter production. Some villages have corrected some of these issues during the winter loan program, but most of the other villages have not resolved them yet.

　　晋城四区村干包办生产
  　贫中农都吃大亏
    【太岳消息】晋城四区有不少村子在组织冬季生产互助中，伤害了贫雇农的利益，阻碍和破坏了冬季生产。据晋城银行辅廷同志在作贷款工作时的调查，发现干部在生产中的“大公家”思想与统制思想很厉害，一切生产不准私人搞，强迫归公。做的结果大大伤害了贫雇农的利益。如小箕村、油坊头等村，不让私人开店，统归合作社包办。把五家雇贫开的小店强迫关了门，合作社开了一个大店。因为店少客多，就把客人送到原来开小店的人家住宿，第二天合作社再去把店钱收回来。雇贫农气的说：“咱懂不得这叫什么互助。”这些话传到村干部的耳朵里，就吓唬群众说：“这叫大公无私，你想一人发财么？”群众只好忍气吞声，再不敢过问。东岭村是全村大互助，全村五十多户，不分你我把一切生产都搞在一起，有纺织、煤窑、磨坊、运输等，做活不计工，也没有工资。赚下的钱统统归公，也不及时分红。中贫农都不满意，生产情绪不高，中农说：“咱这还不知道给谁跑哩！再费大劲还不知分多大点红利。”贫农说：“咱实在贴不起，动了一冬天没见过一个钱。”不落下村三个贫雇搞运输，赚了十二万元，干部说：“你们分上五万，七万归了公吧！”雇贫没法，只好照干部的吩咐把七万元归了公家。小箕合作社经营的煤窑、木作、饭铺用的工人不分技术工人与学徒，每天都按四升米算。工资又不按时发。木匠韩发科说：“咱一天不发工资，全家人就要饿肚，地都冻了，咱还穿不上棉袄。”纺织厂的学徒已经学会了织布，也不给工资也不管饭。海州的娘说：“咱真赔不起人家，媳妇学织布，每天不赚一个钱，还得天天往那里送饭。”别处纺一斤花工资八百元，小箕纺一斤是六百元。雇贫农说：“这样咱赚的少，合作社赚的多，可是合作社咱又没股金，咱又分不上红，反正咱总是吃亏。”小箕从去年二月就派了十个长差，在家里停着不许出门，里面有四个雇贫，其中两人当下就没吃的，哀求了干部几次要出去跑一趟，赚几个钱，干部都不允许。还有的干部自私自利不愿和雇贫农组在一块生产，怕吃了亏：作堂街政治主任耿长兹召集群众开会高喊组织起来互助生产，会后他可一人去运输走了。群众生产不生产他再也没有问过。庙西村的干部都出去生产了，雇贫因为没本钱坐在家里没动。左匠村副看见煤窑不赚钱，硬逼群众打煤窑，他可是天天去跑买卖。小箕村干部规定每天牲口出外一天，交合作社二百元。人出外全劳力每天交一百元。半劳力交五十元。大大压低了生产情绪。特别是雇贫农缺钱没牲口，凭劳力赚钱很有限，一天抽一百元，赚不了钱还得赔本，所以就不干了。广顺老汉说：“别村都是不劳动受罚，咱村是劳动有罪。”就因为这样，全村有二十多个雇贫农从冬季生产以来就没有动弹。
    以上这些没有阶级立场的事情，都大大伤害了雇贫农利益，阻碍和破坏了冬季生产。在冬季贷款中有个别村庄纠正了一些，其他大部村子还没有解决。
