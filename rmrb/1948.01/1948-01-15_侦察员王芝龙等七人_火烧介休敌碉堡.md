Scout Wang Zhilong and Six Others
　　Burn Down Enemy Bunker in Jiexiu

　　[Taiyue News] Wang Zhilong (nicknamed Zhao Zilong), a scout from the First Military Sub-district, along with Song Biao and five others, infiltrated the enemy stronghold in Zhangliang, Jiexiu, on the night of December 24th and set fire to three enemy bunkers. Ever since the battle of Zhangbao, in which one enemy battalion was wiped out, the 61st Army stationed at Zhangliang has been terrified. They dare not sleep in Zhangliang at night, and go to the Yi'an stronghold to spend the night instead. Wang Zhilong learned of this situation and on the night of the 24th, he and Song Biao and the members of the Qiao Degong combat team sneaked to the edge of Zhangliang village. After the enemy's large force had passed, they entered the village, first capturing the puppet village chief and ordering him to lead the way to Liang Bingyuan's courtyard, the location of the puppet village office. From there, they reached the Kuixinglou large bunker in the southeast corner, and used two bundles of sorghum stalks and a match to set the bunker ablaze. The small bunkers on the south and east gate towers were also soon on fire. The flames illuminated the entire village, and the enemies at the North Pass bunker (Hongshan stronghold) and the Yi'an railway station organized heavy firepower to fire towards Zhangliang, but they dared not come down to put out the fire. On the 27th, Wang Zhilong went alone to Neidaxu village, which is a little over a mile north of the station and less than a mile south of Zhangliang. Small groups of "hook-up troops" often passed through here. At lunchtime that day, three hook-up soldiers with rifles slung over their backs walked over from the north and ran into Wang Zhilong. He pulled out his pistol and shouted at the enemies to stop. Two of them disobeyed and turned to run away. Wang Zhilong fired and shot one down. One enemy standing in front of him seized the opportunity to pounce on him, trying to capture him alive. Zhilong threw away his pistol and wrestled with him. After a while, the enemy let out a pig-like scream, covered in blood, and ran away.

　　侦察员王芝龙等七人
  　火烧介休敌碉堡
    【太岳消息】一分区侦察员王芝龙（人叫他赵子龙）、宋彪等七人，十二月二十四日夜，深入介休张良敌据点内，放火烧了敌人的三个碉堡。自从张堡一仗消灭了敌人一个营以后，可把张良据点的六十一军慌坏了。每天黑夜不敢在张良睡觉，都跑到义安据点过夜。王芝龙知道了这种情况后，二十四号黑夜，就和乔德功战斗队的队员宋彪等七人摸到张良村边，等敌人的大队人马过去后，他们就进入村内，先把伪村长捉住，叫他引路到伪村公所梁炳元的院内，从那里到了东南角的奎星楼大碉，用两捆高粱杆和一根火柴就把这个碉堡烧起来，南门与东门楼上的小碉堡不多一会也着了火，这时火光照红全村，北关碉堡（洪山据点）与义安车站的敌人，组织了强大的火力，向张良打来，他们可不敢下来救火。二十七日，王芝龙一人到内大许村，这里北离车站一里多，南离张良还不到一里，三三两两的“勾子军”常常打这里经过，这天午饭时分，三个勾子军大背枪从北面走过来，与王芝龙碰了个对面，他掏出手枪吆喝敌人站住，有两个家伙不听命令，掉头就跑，王芝龙开枪就打倒了一个，站在跟前的一个敌人，瞅这机会就向他扑来，企图活捉，芝龙把手枪一丢就和他扭打在一块，一会儿敌人象杀猪一般的尖叫一声，血淋淋的溜跑了。
