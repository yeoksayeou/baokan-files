Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 28th: Comprehensive news from newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas reveals that farmers are suffering from layers of exploitation and oppression under the Chiang bandits' malignant inflation and harsh monopoly system. Farmers must pay high prices when purchasing agricultural supplies and consumer goods, while agricultural products and export raw materials are devalued under the monopoly rule of the four big families, resulting in a very serious state of unequal exchange between agricultural and industrial products. Taking Shanghai as an example: before the Lunar New Year, the price index of raw materials and food was more than 77,000 times that of the pre-war period, with plant foods being more than 71,000 times; while industrial manufactured goods were more than 161,000 times that of the pre-war period. The latter's increase exceeds the former by more than one time. This unequal state is even more profound in the rural areas of the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas. Taking the rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang at the end of 1946 as an example: the price of white rice was 7,500 times higher than before the war, wheat was 8,400 times higher, and soybeans were 6,800 times higher; while at the same time, twelve pounds of fine cloth was 21,300 times higher than before the war, 20-count cotton yarn was 12,300 times higher, matches were 11,000 times higher, and soap was 11,000 times higher. The China Farmers Bank, affiliated with the CC clique leader Chen Lifu, recently published the ratio of agricultural product prices to farmers' industrial necessities in Sichuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai and other provinces since 1944, and had to admit this disparity. The Dagong Bao, affiliated with the Political Science clique, also said: The price of agricultural products lags far behind agricultural supplies and consumer goods, causing serious damage to farmers; and in malignant inflation, landlords increase rents and deposits, raising their land rent rates; usurers raise interest rates, and miscellaneous taxes also increase. The newspaper was also forced to admit that the Chiang bandit gang's various ruling classes have transferred the burden of inflation to the farmers.

### 蒋区粮食涨价赶不上日用品涨价　农民受蒋匪层层剥削

　　蒋区粮食涨价赶不上日用品涨价
  　农民受蒋匪层层剥削
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：蒋区农民在蒋匪恶性通货膨胀，及严酷垄断制度下，受到一层又一层的剥削和压榨。农民在购买农用品及消费品时，须付出高价，而农产品及出口原料品，在四大家族垄断统治下，价格又被贬低，以致农产品与工业品处在极严重的不等价交换状态中。以上海为例：年前十一月原料品与食品价格指数为战前的七万七千余倍，其中植物食品为七万一千余倍；而工业制造品则为战前的十六万一千余倍。后者之上涨超过前者一倍以上。在蒋区农村中这种不等价状态更为深刻，以一九四六年底的江浙农村为例。白粳米价较战前高七千五百倍，小麦高八千四百倍，黄豆高六千八百倍；而同时期的十二磅细布却较战前高二万一千三百倍，二十支棉纱高一万二千三百倍，火柴高一万一千倍，肥皂高一万一千倍。ＣＣ匪首陈立夫系的中国农民银行最近发表的自一九四四年以来四川、甘肃、宁夏、青海等省农产品价格与农民工业必需品的指数比例，亦不得不承认此种悬殊情形。政学系的大公报也说：农产品价格远落在农用品和消费品之后，使农民受到严重损害；且在恶性通货膨胀中，地主加租加押，提高其地租率；高利贷者提高利息率，苛捐杂税也加多加重。该报也被迫承认，将匪帮各统治阶层内部已把通货膨胀的重负转价到农民身上。
