　　Guancheng Stretcher Team
  　Captures Escaped Chiang Bandits Alive

    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan News] During the Dongming-Kaocheng-Heze campaign, the Guancheng stretcher team captured 11 escaped Chiang bandits alive and killed 3. On the morning of December 30th, a unit of the East China People's Liberation Army captured Dongming. A portion of the enemy forces routed at the four passes of Heze attempted to flee southwest, but were discovered by the Guancheng stretcher team. Platoon Leader Feng immediately led more than ten civilian laborers to pursue them, chasing them for five *li* from Songzhuang in one breath, catching up with the fleeing enemies. Three shots hit three men, and the rest fled in disarray. We captured three enemies, seized one rifle, and twenty-five rounds of ammunition. That evening, another five escaped enemies from Dongming were captured alive. On the night of December 31st, in Liuzhuang and Pengzhuang, Song Yuting and Zan Yucheng, soldiers of the Heze Security Brigade and the 181st Brigade, were also captured alive. After the battle, statistics showed that a total of 11 enemies were eliminated, one light machine gun, nine rifles, 175 rounds of ammunition, and eight hand grenades were seized.
