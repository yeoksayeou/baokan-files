Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th: The Northeast Daily recently published an editorial titled "Striving to Complete the Great Historical Task – Celebrating the Great Victory of Shenbei and the Central Work of 1948." The editorial first extended its highest respect to all commanders and fighters who fought resolutely in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius. It then pointed out the significant meaning of this great victory, saying:
	"Our army's powerful winter offensive was a continuous battle fought in extremely harsh and cold weather. It was a battle directly knocking on the gate of the enemy's nest, Shenyang, and it was conducted under highly centralized forces and unified direct command. Therefore, its scale of operations and victory results far exceeded all previous battles. Moreover, as our army's edge was initially tested in this campaign, it successively captured key towns such as Beipiao, Heishan, Dahushan, and Zhangwu. From then on, the strategic connection between our army's eastern and western battlefields was greatly opened up. The victorious conclusion of the battle of Gongzhutun further created an unprecedented large-scale convergence of our Northeast army on one battlefield. From now on, our army will be able to maneuver more freely and conduct large-scale concentrated operations, laying a solid foundation for completely eliminating the enemy forces in the Northeast in the future, advancing victoriously towards the Beining Line, and coordinating with the People's Liberation Army inside the pass to annihilate a large number of enemies."
	The editorial then discussed the dead end of the Chiang bandits in the Northeast and their inevitable fate of defeat, saying: "The great victory of this campaign also shows the precarious and doomed state of the Chiang Chen bandit army in the Northeast. When our army directly approached the enemy's nest, Shenyang, with unprecedentedly powerful forces, the 'dormant state' of the Northeast battlefield envisioned by the bandit chief Chen Cheng failed. He showed even more panic than during the autumn offensive and had to exhaust all his reserves. Among the forty-four divisions of his total force, he concentrated twenty divisions of troops, gathered around the periphery of Shenyang, and vainly attempted to stake everything on a single battle to save his dying fate. However, in the battle of Gongzhutun, two entire divisions and one military headquarters were completely annihilated, and ten divisions were beaten into headlong flight. All the enemy's struggles ended in a disastrous defeat. The fate of the enemy forces, who are now shrinking into a few towns, is firmly in the hands of the people of the Northeast and their sons and daughters in the army. This situation is becoming increasingly clear."
	The editorial finally pointed out that the sacred and glorious task before the entire Party and army in the Northeast is not only to annihilate more Chiang bandit troops in the Northeast and end the evil rule of "Second Manchuria" within 1948, liberating the people of the Northeast, but also to support the national liberation war with constantly increasing manpower and material resources, and to make the new Northeast, with its abundant human resources, the general base for the national liberation war. To this end, the Northeast Daily called on the entire Party, army, and people of the Northeast to do the following central tasks well: (1) Implement land reform and complete the equal distribution of land in the basic liberated areas and newly recovered areas within six months. (2) Fully build the army and boldly expand the main force. (3) Train a large number of cadres, drawing as many cadres as possible from the basic liberated areas to help the masses in the newly recovered areas to stand up and mobilize the masses; organize large-scale work teams to participate in field work with the army; and various military and political cadre schools should train a large number of cadres needed for combat and training. (4) Strengthen the workers' movement in cities, railways, and mines in the liberated areas, mobilize and organize workers to develop production to serve the war and serve the countryside. Call on urban industrialists and businessmen to strive to produce for military and civilian needs. (5) Mobilize and organize millions of people to complete and exceed the 1948 economic construction plan and develop military and civilian industries. Financially, we must achieve further unification and concentration and ensure sufficient military needs. Party, government, military, and civilian institutions in the rear, including county and district armed forces, must solve the task of partial or major self-sufficiency through agricultural production. (6) Rectify the ideological and work style within the Party. The editorial encouraged the Party, government, army, and people in the front and rear of the Northeast to be a hundred times more ambitious, courageous and determined to make persistent efforts, work together, and continuously move from victory to victory to complete the great and glorious task.

　　今年要结束“二满洲”的统治
  　东北日报祝沈北大捷
    【新华社东北十四日电】东北日报顷发表社论，题为“为完成伟大的历史任务而奋斗——庆祝沈北大捷和一九四八年的中心工作”：社论首对本次冒零下三十度严寒，坚忍作战的全体指战员致崇高敬意，次即指出本次大捷的重大意义说：
    “我军此次强大的冬季攻势，是在冒着极恶劣的严寒气候下连续作战，是直叩敌巢沈阳大门的作战，是在兵力高度集中和统一直接指挥之下进行作战。因此其作战规模和胜利战果，都远远超过前此一切战役，而且由于这一战役中我军的锋刃初试，便连下北票、黑山、打虎山以及彰武诸重镇，从此就使得我军东西两大战场的战略联系大为贯通，而公主屯一役的胜利结束，更造成东北我军在一个战场上取得空前大汇合；从此我军更能机动自如大规模的集中作战，打下了今后全部消灭东北敌军，并向北宁线胜利进军，配合关内解放军大量歼敌的胜利基础。”
    社论继即论述东北蒋匪的穷途末路及其必败的命运说：“这一战役的伟大胜利，同时也显示出东北蒋陈匪军摇摇欲坠的穷途末路。当此次我军以空前强大兵力，直逼敌巢沈阳之时，匪首陈诚所幻想的东北战场的‘休眠状态’落了空，表现了较秋季攻势时更为惊慌失措，不得不竭其全部后备力量，在其全部总兵力的四十四个师中，集中了二十个师的部队，集结沈阳外围，妄图孤注一掷，与我决一雌雄，以挽救其垂死的命运。然而公主屯一战，竟落得两个整师和一个军部的全军覆没，十个师被打得抱头鼠窜，敌军的一切挣扎，都归于惨败。今后龟缩少数城镇的敌军，他们的命运是紧紧的掌握在东北人民及其子弟兵的手里，这情景是愈来愈益显明了。”
    社论最后指出：东北全党全军面前神圣而光荣的任务，就是不仅要在一九四八年之内，更大的歼灭东北蒋匪军，结束“二满洲”的罪恶统治，解放东北人民；而且要以不断增加的人力物力，支援全国解放战争，要把人力资源雄厚的新东北，成为全国解放战争的总基地。为此，东北日报号召东北全党全军全体人民必须做好以下的几项中心工作，就是：（一）贯彻土地改革，要在半年内完成基本解放区和新收复区的平分土地。（二）全力建军，放手壮大主力。（三）大量培养干部，要从基本解放区尽量抽调干部，到新收复区帮助群众翻身，发动群众；组织大规模的工作团，随军参加战地工作；各军政干部学校，要大量训练作战练兵所需的各种干部。（四）加强解放区城市铁路、矿山的职工运动，动员和组织工人发展生产为战争服务，为农村服务。号召城市工商业家，努力为军需民用，进行生产。（五）动员与组织千百万人民，完成与超过一九四八年的经建计划，发展军需民用工业。财政上要实现更进一步的统一集中，并保证军需充足。后方党政军民机关，包括县区武装要以农业生产解决部分或大部自给的任务。（六）整顿党内思想和工作作风。社论勉励东北前后方党政军民，要雄心百倍，勇敢坚定地再接再厉，一致努力，不断的从胜利走向胜利，来完成伟大而光荣的任务。
