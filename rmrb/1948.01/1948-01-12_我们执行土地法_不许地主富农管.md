　　We Implement the Land Law
  　No Landlords or Rich Peasants Allowed to Manage
    ·Zhao Shuli·
    Landlords and old rich peasants are people who exploit us; the land law was created to abolish this exploitative system. When implementing it, landlords and old rich peasants will definitely use schemes to sabotage things. The same sentence, when we say it, is for the purpose of doing things well; when landlords and rich peasants say it, it has ulterior motives. For example, if someone takes too much fruit, or a certain cadre should be replaced, when we bring it up it is democracy and should be praised; when landlords and rich peasants bring it up, it is incitement and should be sent to the People's Court for trial. Because whether the fruit is distributed fairly or whether the cadre is suitable is the business of us, the majority of the exploited masses, and has nothing to do with the landlords and rich peasants. If they want to interfere, even if what they say is factual, it is still incitement and disruption! We must recognize this clearly.
    The land law stipulates that landlords receive the same share and rich peasants retain the same share, in order to allow them to maintain their lives and reform themselves. This is originally the generosity of the majority of our peasants. If they eat this share and then come to stir up trouble, then it becomes a criminal act, and we must not be polite to them.

　　我们执行土地法
  　不许地主富农管
    ·赵树理·
    地主和旧富农，是剥削咱们的人；土地法就是为了取消这种剥削制度才定出来的。在执行的时候，地主和旧富农一定要使些阴谋来破坏什么的。同样的一句话，我们说出来为的是把事情办好，地主富农说出就是别有用心，比方某人多占了果实，某干部应该撤换，我们提出来是民主，应该称赞，地主富农提出来就是挑拨，应送人民法庭受审。因为果实分得公不公，干部合适不合适，都是我们大多数被剥削的群众的事，与地主富农一字无干，他要来管，就是说的事实，也是挑拨、捣乱！这一点我们要认识得清清楚楚。
    土地法里规定给地主分同样的一份，给富农留同样的一份，为的是叫他们维持生活来改造自己，原是我们大多数农民的宽大，要是他们吃上这一份再来挑弄是非，那就成了犯罪行为，我们对他们绝不能客气。
