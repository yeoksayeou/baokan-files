　　The Battle of Liberation of Yuncheng

　　Since the Jin-South People's Liberation Army dealt a devastating blow to the Chiang bandit reinforcements in Yuncheng on November 21st of last year, the bandit army in Yuncheng, seeing that the reinforcements had fled, faced the crisis of being annihilated. Their only option was to rely on fortifications. They painstakingly rebuilt the outer pillboxes that had been destroyed by our army in the previous battle, completely reinforcing them with iron rails and steel plates, and installing telephones, lighting equipment, running water, and underground passages, creating relatively modern defensive works. At the same time, they completely replaced the local bandit troops who had been annihilated in the previous battle while defending the outer strongholds with regular troops. In this way, the bandit army believed they had created an impregnable defense, relying on strong outer strongholds and pillbox clusters to protect the city walls and outer moats, with heavy artillery fire from within the city supporting the outer pillbox fortifications, mutually dependent on each other.

　　However, starting from December 17th, our army continued to completely encircle Yuncheng with superior forces and firepower, and quickly launched a mopping-up operation against the outer strongholds. From the 20th to the 22nd, in just three days, we completely cleared the outer strongholds, destroying more than ten strong pillboxes and more than fifty buried bunkers, annihilating more than 500 bandits (including more than 430 captured alive). At the same time, in this battle, even the bandit army's reliance on solid fortifications, such as the Majiayao in the southwest corner of the city and the Memorial Tower in the north of the city, which were considered two of the four major positions, were flattened by our army's fierce artillery bombardment in less than twenty minutes. Even their reliance on regular troops to hold firm, as in the battles at the large pillbox in the northwest corner of the city and the clusters of pillboxes in the southwest, resulted in the annihilation of entire platoons and companies upon contact with our army, with no one escaping. Even their reliance on artillery support from the city, as in the battle at the Memorial Tower (more than forty meters from the city wall), where the enemies on the city wall could even throw hand grenades, resulted in the complete suppression of the city wall's firepower under the coordinated action of our infantry, artillery, and engineers, and fierce attacks. In short, everything the bandit army relied upon became conditions for the People's Liberation Army to create a brilliant record of siege warfare, demonstrating the complete bankruptcy of the bandit army's foolish tactics of relying on strong fortifications, a large force, and holding out in an isolated city.

　　As the People's Liberation Army completely cleared the bandit army's outer strongholds, the entire Yuncheng was exposed to the People's Liberation Army. On the 27th, the People's Liberation Army launched a general attack on the city wall. At this time, the Chiang bandit army hastily gathered eight brigades, including the First Brigade, the Seventy-eighth Brigade, and the Twenty-eighth Brigade, in the Shanzhou and Lingbao areas, attempting to cross the river and reinforce the city. However, the powerful People's Liberation Army, while fighting the reinforcements, continued to attack the city. The city attack began at 5:00 PM. Under the cover of fierce artillery fire, our brave demolitionists first used a large amount of explosives to blow a gap in the old North Gate, sending the defending bandits from the city wall dozens of meters into the air. Part of our army immediately broke into the city at a speed of thirty minutes. At this time, under the assistance of aircraft and the cover of fierce artillery fire, the bandit army launched more than ten counterattacks, attempting to close the breach and annihilate our army in the city. However, our brave artillerymen, in coordination with the infantry, concentrated even more intense artillery fire on the city wall and into the depth, immediately eliminating five companies of bandits in the city. The bandit army's desperate counterattacks turned into a panicked escape. Our troops rushed to climb the city wall and occupy the high ground of the iron factory, East Garden, Bell and Drum Tower, etc. After fierce fighting until dawn on the 28th, we annihilated more than 7,000 enemies (with more than 5,000 captured alive), and Yuncheng was completely occupied by us. The remaining 3,000 enemy troops, regardless of life or death, waded through the salt lake and fled south in disarray, but the next day they fell into our army's ambush north of Qilipo in Pinglu and were completely annihilated. In total, more than 10,000 enemies were annihilated before and after the battle.

　　解放运城战役经过
    自去年十一月二十一日晋南人民解放军给增援运城蒋匪以歼灭性打击后，运城匪军眼看援兵回窜，将有被歼危机，唯一的办法，就是依靠工事，于是苦心把上次战役被我军摧毁的外围碉堡，完全以铁轨、钢板重新修复，并设置电话、照明器材、自来水及地下交通，构成较近代化的防御工事。同时，又把上次战役遭我歼灭性打击的困守外围据点的地方匪军，完全换成正规军。这样匪军便发现了以外围的强固据点碉堡群，保护城垣与外壕，以城内的强烈炮火，支援外围碉堡工事，互相依存，并自以为铜墙铁壁，不可攻破。
    但是自十二月十七日开始，我军继续以优势的兵力火力，将运城完全包围，并迅速向外围据点展开扫荡，从二十日至二十二日三天当中，即把外围据点完全肃清，计摧毁强固碉堡十余座，及伏地碉五十余个，歼匪五百余名（其中包括活捉四百三十余名）。同时在此次战役中，匪军依靠坚固工事，也不过为城西南角马家窑及城北纪念塔所谓四大阵地之二的那样坚固，但一经我军猛烈炮火轰击，不及二十分钟，就被炸成平地。依靠正规军固守，也不过如城西北角大碉、西南群碉等地战斗那样，一经我军接触，全排全连被歼，无一漏网。依靠城里火力支援，也不过如纪念塔（距城四十余公尺）等地战斗那样，城垣的敌人甚至连手榴弹都可以扔过来，但在我步、炮、工协同动作，猛烈攻击之下，城垣的火力立即全被压下。总之，匪军依靠的一切，适为人民解放军创造攻坚战光辉纪录的条件，并说明匪军与强固工事依靠强大兵力困守孤城的愚笨战术，完全破产。
    随着人民解放军完全扫清匪军外围据点之际，整个运城便赤裸裸暴露于人民解放军面前。廿七日人民解放军就向城垣展开总攻，此时蒋匪军又派出第一旅、七十八旅、二十八旅等八个旅，仓慌集结陕州、灵宝地区，企图过河增援，但是强大的人民解放军，一面与援军作战，一面继续攻城。攻城战斗自下午五时开始，在猛烈炮火掩护下，我英勇的爆炸手，首先以大量的炸药把旧北门掀开一个缺口，把守城匪军从城头掀向数十公尺之高空，我军一部即以三十分钟速度，突入城内，此时匪军在飞机助战及猛烈炮火掩护下，进行十余次反扑，企图合拢突破口，把我军消灭于城中，但我英勇的炮手，配合步兵，集中更多猛烈的炮火，打向城垣、打向纵深，当即消灭城中匪军五个连，匪军的拼命反扑，便变成狼狈逃命。我如万马奔腾、争相登城占领铁工厂、东花园、钟鼓楼等制高点，激战至二十八日拂晓，当歼敌七千余名（仅生俘即有五千余名），运城遂为我完全占领。另外三千残敌，当夜不顾死活，涉过盐池冲出，向南落荒而逃，但第二天即在平陆以北七里坡陷入我军预伏网中，全部被歼，总计前后歼敌万余人。
