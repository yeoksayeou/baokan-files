The cultural work in East China has greatly contributed to the patriotic self-defense war and the peasant liberation movement over the past year.

　　Xinhua branch offices are set up in all front-line columns, and hundreds of people's reporters go deep into the companies. In peacetime, they share weal and woe with the soldiers, and in wartime, they enter the trenches and even fight side by side. Model reporters such as Song Dake and Qian Yi (the eldest son of writer A Ying) and ten others bravely sacrificed their lives, and Wang Chuanguan and four others were gloriously wounded. The army newspapers insisted on publishing during frequent battles. The lead printing factory of the East China Frontline Newspaper of the Political Department of the East China People's Liberation Army has been traveling with the army on trucks for a long time. Each column and regiment has mimeographed newspapers, which have become a powerful weapon to boost morale. Countless literary and art workers, including cultural troupes, drama troupes, film teams, and primary school teachers, go to the front line to serve the soldiers. They cooperate with the propaganda and education workers of the troops to carry out recreational activities in the companies in peacetime, and help dig fortifications and rescue the wounded in wartime. In Jiaodong alone, more than 70 literary and art workers went to the front line to perform films such as "A White Sailboat." The film team of the Political Department of the East China Field Army has been active with the army for a long time, performing Soviet famous films such as "The Battle of Berlin" and its own films such as "Huaibei Light Cavalry." The popular editions of Soviet masterpieces "Fear and Courage," "Days and Nights," "Soldier and Commander," and "Our Sixth Company" reprinted by the Xinhua Bookstore following the army are purchased by the majority of commanders and fighters, and have become the best reading material for educating the troops. The Jiaodong Xinhua Bookstore held book and periodical consolation activities from August to November, purchasing and donating more than 40,000 copies of books and periodicals and more than 2.24 million yuan in cash to the front line. The Binhai Xinhua Bookstore organized a battlefield cultural service team to promote sales on tour.

　　In the rear, Xinhua branch offices are all over the military regions and military sub-districts. The Huazhong Xinhua Branch alone has seven branch offices, more than 600 cadres, and more than 25,000 correspondents. The most articles received daily reach more than 3,000. The Yancheng Public Daily has cultivated worker-peasant reporters, which has made significant achievements in reporting. The newspapers include the East China Public Daily, the Jiaodong Public Daily, the Bohai Daily, the Luzhong Public, the Lunan Times, the Binhai Rural, the Huaihai Daily, the Huanghai Daily, the Subei Daily, the Jianghai Daily, the Dawn Daily, and 34 types of newspapers, popularized public newspapers, and books from various sub-districts and troops. In Bohai, there is also the Islamic Newspaper serving the Hui people. The Yantai Daily and Xinwei Daily, which were temporarily transferred from Yantai and Weihaiwei, still insist on publishing during the war, and all publish news of people's armed activities with the largest coverage. In the Huazhong area, in order to adapt to the development of the new situation, the famous Xinhua Daily Huazhong Edition has been re-published on New Year's Day this year.

　　Xinhua Bookstore branches and distributors are all over the counties and cities and larger market towns. Over the past year, the Shandong Xinhua Bookstore Headquarters has compiled and printed more than 300 kinds of books, including three types of small production series and public libraries that are popular among workers and peasants. A bimonthly "Cultural Liberation" was specially published for liberated peasants and their teachers. The Jiaodong Xinhua Bookstore published a total of 1.8 million books and textbooks. Other large-scale magazines that insisted on and were born in the war include Shandong Culture, Xinhua Digest, Jiaodong Literature and Art, Jianghai Magazine, etc. Among them, Jiaodong Literature and Art alone sells more than 10,000 copies per issue. The Jiaodong Xinhua Bookstore published "New Party Member Reader" and sold 130,000 copies.

　　In the war and the tense support for the front and production review, formal primary schools in every village in Jiaodong still opened as usual, with 600,000 children enrolled. Part-time work and part-time study organizations are popular in various places, with early classes, afternoon classes, and evening classes, using the little teacher system to educate poor and out-of-school children. Many primary school teachers participated in stretcher transport teams for recreational activities, and many poured into the guerrillas and fought side by side with the militia. In the three counties of Ju County, Zhuting, and Tancheng, more than 200 teachers participated in the guerrillas to launch political offensives against the enemy, writing slogans, printing and distributing propaganda materials, etc. In secondary education, Jiaodong alone has 26 secondary schools and above, with more than 6,000 students. Middle schools in Yantai, Weihaiwei, Longkou, and other places that are unwilling to be ruled by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits have also temporarily moved out of the city to continue classes. The Huazhong Second District established a worker-peasant school to improve the political and cultural level of rural hired and poor peasant components and party cadres, and prepare for the transformation and strengthening of district and township governments. The Yancheng District has determined a new policy of "education serving the liberated masses, and schools belonging to the liberated masses," so that schools are run, managed, and studied by the people. Before the land reform, only 10% of the hired and poor students in Zefu Middle School in Ye Ting County were hired, but now it has increased sharply to 60%. Binhai and other places have trained a large number of new winter school teachers and village clerks and accountants to serve the village government after the land reform.

　　In terms of mass cultural activities, nine counties in Huaihai have successively established worker-peasant cultural associations. Over the past year, the masses have created more than 40 complete scripts and more than 10 drum lyrics. Xinghua's liberated peasants in Suzhong have organized 47 drama troupes, of which 17 troupes have created 185 scripts and ditties, performed 325 times, and had 155,000 viewers.

　　There have been many creations in wartime cultural work. Almost every village in Jiaodong has a "broadcasting station" (a high platform built in the center of the village), which has become a new tool for spreading victory news and educating the masses. The "mobile bookstore" in Zhentong has established more than 60 book and newspaper distribution points in the guerrilla environment, selling more than 58,000 copies of various books and newspapers, with more than 200,000 readers. Wherever there is a mass gathering, they carry their schoolbags and rush to it. In the marginal area, the method of carrying burdens is adopted. When the situation comes, the burdens are transferred; when the situation passes, the transaction is normal. During the extremely brutal "encirclement and suppression," the mobile bookstore still shuttles back and forth, trading at night and transferring during the day. Every household of the liberated peasants in Zixin, Maoshan, and other districts has a "Worker-Peasant Reader" or "Singing for Everyone" and other reading materials. The "Mobile Propaganda Team" of Baoying Middle School consists of three people and three guns. They carry a huqin, carry a lime bucket, fight when they encounter the enemy, walk and sing when they encounter the enemy, and write. Cao Dejin of Tai County created a "cultural backpack." He often carries colored paper and mimeographing equipment to follow the troops, and insists on writing propaganda materials in the fields during the most difficult "bloody encirclement and suppression."

　　华东人民的文化军
    华东各地文化工作为爱国自卫战争及农民翻身运动服务，一年来贡献极大。
    在前线各纵队都设有新华支社，成百以上的人民记者深入连队，平时与战士同甘苦，战时则入战壕，甚至并肩作战，先后有模范记者宋大可、钱毅（作家阿英长子）等十人英勇牺牲，王传贯等四人光荣负伤。部队报纸在频繁战斗中坚持出报，华东解放军政治部华东前线报的铅印厂，长时期在卡车上跟部队辗转战地。各纵队、团都有油印报纸，成为鼓舞士气的有力武器，无数文艺工作者包括文工团、剧团、电影队、小学教师等，身临前线为战士服务。他们配合部队的宣教工作者，平时开展连队的文娱工作，战时即帮助挖工事救伤员。单胶东一地就有七十余文艺工作者奔赴战地，胶东军区政治部电影队赴火线出演“一只白帆船”等片。华东野战军政治部电影队则长期随军活动，演出了苏联名片“柏林之战”及自己摄制之“淮北轻骑队”等影片多种。随军新华书店翻印之苏联名著“恐惧与无畏”、“日日夜夜”的通俗本及“兵士兼统帅”、“我们的六连”等书均为广大指战员所争购，并成为教育部队的最好读物。胶东新华书店在八至十一月举办书刊劳军，购赠前线书刊四万余册及现款二二四万余元。滨海新华书店组织了战地文化服务队，巡回推销。
    在后方，新华分支社遍及各军区、军分区。华中新华分社即拥有七个支社，干部六百余人，通讯员两万五千余人。每日来稿最多时达三千余篇。盐阜大众日报培养了工农记者，使报导上获显著成绩。报纸则有华东大众日报、胶东大众报、渤海日报、鲁中大众、鲁南时报、滨海农村、淮海报、黄海日报、苏北日报、江海报、拂晓报及各分区部队报、通俗化大众报、书报等三十四种。在渤海更有为回胞服务的伊斯兰报，从烟台、威海卫两地暂时转移之烟台日报、新威日报，仍在战争中坚持出版，均以最大篇幅登载人民武装活动消息。华中方面，由于适应新形势的发展，过去著名的新华日报华中版已于今年元旦复刊。
    新华书店分支店及代销处遍布各县市及较大集镇。一年来山东新华书店总店编印各种书籍达三百多种，其中为工农喜爱的生产小丛书、大众文库各三三种。并为翻身农民及其教师专门出版了“文化翻身”半月刊。胶东新华书店出版书籍、课本共达一八○万册。其他在战争中坚持和诞生的大型杂志有山东文化、新华文摘、胶东文艺、江海杂志等多种，其中仅胶东文艺每期即销售万余册。胶东新华书店印行之“新党员读本”销售达十三万册。
    在战争与紧张的支前复查与生产中，胶东每村正式小学仍照常开学，入学儿童达六十万。半工半读性的学习组织普及各地，有早班、午班、晚班等，以小先生制教育贫苦失学儿童。许多小学教师参加担架运输队进行文娱活动，许多涌入游击队与民兵并肩作战，莒县、竹庭、郯城三县即有二百余教师参加游击队对敌展开政治攻势，写标语、印发宣传品等。中学教育，仅胶东即有中等以上学校二十六所，学生六千余名。不甘蒋匪统治之烟台、威海卫、龙口等地之中学亦暂迁市外继续上课。华中二分区设立了工农学校，以提高乡村雇贫农成份及党员干部之政治文化水平，作改造和加强区乡政权之准备。盐阜区则确定“教育为翻身群众服务，学校为翻身群众所有”的新方针，使学校为民办、民管、民学。叶挺县泽夫中学土改前雇贫学生仅占百分之十，现已激增到百分之六十。滨海等地训练了大批新的冬学教师及村文书、会计，为土改后的村政权服务。
    群众文化活动方面：淮海九个县相继成立了工农文协，一年来群众自己创作完整的剧本四十多种，鼓词十多种。苏中兴化翻身农民所组织之剧团达四十七个，其中十七个剧团就创作了剧本小调一八五种，演出三二五次，拥有观众十五万五千人。
    战时文化工作更有不少创造，胶东各县几乎村村都有“广播台”（村子中央搭一高台）成为传播胜利消息及教育群众的新工具。溱潼“流动书店”在游击环境中建立了六十多个书报代销处，出售各种书报五万八千多份，拥有读者二十余万人。凡有群众集会处就背起书包赶去。在边沿区则采用挑担子方式，情况一来挑担子转移；情况一过又照常交易。在极残酷的“清剿”中，流动书店仍穿梭往来，夜晚交易，白天转移，梓辛、矛山等区翻身农民每户都有一本“工农读本”或“大家唱”之类的读物。宝应中学的“流动宣传队”由三个人三条枪组成，他们背着胡琴，提着石灰桶，遇敌就打，遇敌走唱、就写。泰县曹德进创造“文化背包”，他经常背着五色纸及油印器具跟随部队行动，在最艰苦的“血洗清剿”中坚持在田野里写宣传品。
