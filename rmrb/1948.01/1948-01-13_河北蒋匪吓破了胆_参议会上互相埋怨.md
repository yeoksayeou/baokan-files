Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Beiping News: At the Chiang bandit Hebei Provincial Council meeting held last month, pseudo-councilors, during infighting and mutual attacks, revealed the panicked state of Chiang bandit officers and soldiers in Hebei under the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army. Last May, when the People's Liberation Army attacked the Doudian Railway Station in Liangxiang, only twenty soldiers occupied the station without firing a single shot; the Chiang bandit garrison had rolled up their bedding in advance and fled. In the battle to attack Matou Town in Zhuoxian County, the Chiang bandit newspapers deceived people by saying, "Many communists were killed," but in fact, the Chiang bandit army fled without firing a single shot again. More than 3,000 Chiang bandit security team members lived near Fangshan County, and when they heard that the People's Liberation Army was about to attack, they quickly withdrew. The day after the People's Liberation Army captured Shijiazhuang, the secretary-general of the Hebei Chiang bandit provincial government escorted more than seventy cars from Baoding to Beiping. The pseudo-councilor himself also said dejectedly, "This meeting is still being held in Beiping. Will the next meeting be able to return to Baoding instead of going to Nanjing or Hong Kong?" The pseudo-councilors' speeches also revealed that Chiang bandit officers and soldiers were extorting the common people everywhere. In Xincheng County, each mu of land yielded nine dou of grain. Even petty officers had to have the local area share the cost of their marriages. Trees as thick as bowls were all cut down. The Chiang bandits took whatever the common people had. The common people in the Chiang-controlled areas compared the Chiang bandits to combs and fine-toothed combs, as everything the common people had was squeezed out.

　　河北蒋匪吓破了胆
  　参议会上互相埋怨
    【新华社陕北九日电】北平消息：在上月开会的蒋匪河北省参议会上，伪参议员在内哄互相攻击中，泄露河北蒋匪官兵在解放军强大攻势中的惊慌情形。去年五月解放军攻良乡的窦店车站时，仅以二十个战士没放一枪就占领了车站，蒋匪驻军预先卷好铺盖逃之夭夭。攻涿县马头镇一役，蒋匪报纸骗人说：“打死了很多共军”，但事实上蒋匪军队又是一枪没放的逃跑了。房山县附近住有蒋匪保安队三千多人，听说解放军要攻击时亦赶快撤走。在解放军攻克石家庄的第二天，河北蒋匪省政府秘书长从保定押着七十余辆汽车逃到北平。该伪参议员自己亦垂头丧气的说：“这次开会还在北平开，下次开会能回保定而不是到南京或香港吗？”伪参议员发言中并泄露蒋匪官兵到处压榨老百姓，新城县每亩出粮到九斗，就连小军官娶老婆也要地方摊派钱，碗口粗的树都给砍光，老百姓有什么他们要什么。蒋区老百姓把蒋匪比做梳子和篦子，老百姓的一切都被勒索精光。
