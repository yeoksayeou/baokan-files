　　[Report from our Taiyue Bureau on the 4th] Since the liberation of Tunliu County, the masses in Dongguan have not been emancipated. The power of the village government is still in the hands of the local tyrant and rich peasant "Xu family." Xu Lizhi has close ties with the Japanese devils and Yang, the captain of the Tunliu County Garrison; he still keeps more than a hundred sheep belonging to the traitor Yang. He even gave his daughter to a Japanese devil who was helping with trials in the county government as a goddaughter. Now, he is the manager of the Dongguan Cooperative. His younger brother, Xu Lizhi, is the accountant and vice chairman of the Farmers' Association. His brother Xu Xilai is also an accountant. Zeng Xihe (chairman of the Farmers' Association) also stands with them and follows the instructions of the Xu family. When collecting grain last month, the masses determined a reasonable burden quota at a mass meeting, with an average of 1.4 dou of grain per share. Nine poor and hired peasant families were not supposed to bear any burden at all. However, the Xu family felt that their burden was too heavy and said, "Can you not bear any burden after liberation?" So they privately revised the burden quota, adding 108 shares to the nine poor and hired peasant families who were not supposed to bear any burden at all. Tian Chuangze's original quota was 1.094 shares, but it was suddenly increased to 18 shares. Bao ×gen's original quota was 9.024 shares, and it was also increased to 18 shares. As a result, the Xu family's share was reduced by 0.41 dou per share, all added to the poor and hired peasants. When winter production began, the higher authorities called for solving the production difficulties of the poor and hired peasants. The Xu brothers felt that there was an opportunity to exploit, so the four brothers, along with their relatives Wang Tinggui, Yang Changfa of the dye shop, and Zeng Xihe, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, etc., took the cooperative's cotton ginning machine and valued it at 80,000 yuan, making it their family's private production equipment. They earned 150 yuan for ginning one jin of cotton, and they could gin 80 to 100 jin per day. They earned 80,000 yuan in one month, giving the money to the cooperative, and the machine became the private property of the eight families. When the poor and hired peasants wanted to take the oil from the cooperative to sell and earn some money, the Xu family flatly refused. They even said, "Our oil mill's oil is not enough to sell!" Gao Changfa and others had no livestock or capital to engage in production, and they were stuck at home with no way to make a living, but the Xu family did not care at all. What is the point of having such a cooperative?

　　屯留东关解放二年
  　奸霸照旧压迫贫雇
    【本报太岳四日电】屯留县解放以来到现在，东关群众就没有翻了身，村政大权都掌握在奸霸富农“徐家”手里；徐立志和日本鬼子、屯留县警备大队长杨某有密切关系，现在还保存着杨逆的一百多只羊。又把闺女认给日本鬼子县政府帮审当干闺女，现在还当东关合作社的经理。他的弟弟徐立之当会计兼农会副主席。他的兄弟徐西来也当会计。曾喜和（农会主席）也和他们站在一个立场上，听从徐家的指使。上月屯粮时，群众大会上评定了合理负担的分数，每一分平均一斗四升粮，有九家贫雇农根本不负担。可是徐家觉得自己太重，就说：“翻了身还能不负担？”就私下修改了负担分数，九家根本不负担的贫雇农就给加上了一百零八分。田创则原来分数是一分九厘四，一下子就加成了十八分。鲍×根原来分数九分二厘四，也加成十八分。这样一来，徐家每分就减了四升一合，都加到贫雇农身上了。冬季生产开始，上级号召解决贫雇农的生产困难，徐家弟兄又觉着有空子可钻，弟兄四人，拿出三头牲口和他的亲戚王廷桂、染房杨长发、农会主席曾喜和等八家把合作社弹花机作了八万价，归他们家生产弹花。每弹一斤一百五十元，每一天能弹八十斤到一百斤。一月中就赚了八万元，把钱归合作社，机器就成了八家的私有。贫雇农想把合作社的油担出贩卖赚几个钱，徐家就一概不行。还说：“咱油房的油不够卖哩！”高长发等根本没有牲口，也没本钱闹生产，在家困着没法办，他们根本不管，象这样的合作社还要他干甚？
