Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 11th: The Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army's field units convened a meeting of Party member cadres in November of last year to convey the spirit and resolutions of the National Land Conference and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Land Conference. The conference decided that the entire army would participate in land reform and simultaneously carry out a general Party rectification and military consolidation movement. At the meeting, General Luo Ruiqing, Deputy Political Commissar of the Military Region, pointed out: Mass work is one of the three major tasks of our army, and today it means participating in land reform. Our predecessor, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, had the glorious tradition of "overthrowing local bullies and distributing land," which we must inherit and promote well today. The headquarters' declaration calls on us to learn two skills: annihilating the enemy and awakening the masses. Awakening the masses means helping the peasants to turn over. The army's participation in land reform can boost the peasants' momentum; and can enhance the army's mass perspective, strengthen the relationship between the army and the people, and between the army and the local government (army and local areas), raise the class consciousness of commanders and fighters, and greatly strengthen the army's combat effectiveness. Party rectification and military consolidation within the army itself is an extremely important condition, so the army should attach extreme importance to the implementation of this political task. Deputy Political Commissar Luo also put forward several principles: (1) Re-conduct land reform education to eliminate ideological obstacles, announce the law on punishing violations of people's interests and the discipline in participating in land reform, and strictly prohibit obstructing and sabotaging land reform, and shielding landlords and rich peasants from illegal activities. (2) The army's participation in land reform is under the unified leadership of the local Party. (3) The company's soldiers' committee will set up a land reform work group to be responsible for land investigation, propaganda, and organization of the masses in the garrison area. (4) The field army will transfer good cadres and soldiers to participate in the land reform work teams in relevant areas. (5) Fixed garrison agencies, schools, and troops will participate in land reform work in the garrisoned villages. (6) All troops and garrison agencies should mobilize all personnel to participate in mass meetings to pour out grievances, cheer for the peasants, carry out class education in the troops, and may also transfer a certain number of people to participate in nearby local work teams. (7) Carry out propaganda and investigation in the Chiang area, and when conditions are ripe, the political organs should cooperate with local organizations to form work teams to mobilize the masses. (8) Protect the peasants' struggle to turn over in the border areas, and be responsible for guarding and covering the distribution of land and floating wealth. (9) Write letters home: encourage hired and poor peasant soldiers to encourage their families to participate in the struggle, and those from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds should advise and warn their families to abide by the land law, obey the new peasant association, and not engage in any illegal activities. (10) Handle the registration and notification of liberated soldiers in accordance with the method of distributing land to liberated soldiers. (11) Resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary armed rebellions that may be launched by landlords and rich peasants.
    Regarding the issue of Party rectification and military consolidation in the army, Deputy Political Commissar Luo said: The impurity within the army's Party and the unhealthy work style are also very serious. In some leadership links, landlords and rich peasants are "in command" for a time, instead of our leading cadres.
    Regarding the specific methods of Party rectification and military consolidation in the army, Deputy Political Commissar Luo pointed out: (1) Carry out a movement to check class background, check ideology, and check work style among all army cadres, and a movement to pour out grievances among the soldiers. (2) Carry out organizational adjustments in important leading organs and several leading links. (3) Clean out class aliens who have infiltrated into rear agencies and production departments. (4) Ideologically degenerate, corrupt, and fallen elements cannot assume leadership positions without correction and testing. (5) Increase the power of Party committees at all levels, and the chiefs should obey the leadership of the Party committee. (6) All matters in the company should go through the branch, so that the branch becomes the highest leading organ in the company. (7) Establish soldiers' committees in companies and food units, giving soldiers economic and political democracy, regularly conduct criticism and appraisal of cadres and Party members, Party members of the branch should be open in the company, and listen to the opinions of the soldiers' meeting on the admission and expulsion of Party members; the company's soldiers' committee should be based on outstanding elements of workers, hired and poor peasants.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 11th: The Political Department of the Ji-Zhong Military Region recently ordered the entire army to participate in the land reform movement. (A) Assist the villages in the garrison area to carry out the following tasks: (1) Investigate the masses' reactions to land reform and the destructive activities of landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements, and promptly report them to the sub-district representative meetings or the poor peasant group representative meetings. (2) Publicize the Outline Land Law and the joint announcement and letter to the peasants. (3) If landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements resist and sabotage land reform, it is necessary to assist the peasants in suppressing them. (4) Assist in the implementation of all resolutions of the poor peasant groups and the new peasant associations. (B) With the organs and troops branches as units, designate special personnel to establish relations with the poor peasant groups and the new peasant associations (or nearby sub-district representative meetings), unconditionally implement the resolutions of the poor peasant groups and the new peasant associations, and it is not allowed to establish relations indiscriminately, or to take over, force orders, or contact bad cadres. The leaders of each unit, the Party committees at all levels, and the branches must organize all personnel to assist the land reform in the garrisoned villages, and take the aforementioned four tasks as one of the important daily tasks. The order also stipulates the discipline during the land reform period, such as not interfering in the masses' struggle, and not encroaching on the fruits of the struggle.

　　晋察冀野战军开会决定
  　全军参加土地改革
    【新华社晋察冀十一日电】晋察冀解放军各野战部队于去年十一月召开党员干部大会，传达全国土地会议及晋察冀边区土地会议精神与各项决议。大会决定全军参加土地改革，同时普遍进行整党整军运动。会上军区副政治委员罗瑞卿将军指出：群众工作是我军三大任务之一，今天说，就是参加土地改革。我们的前身工农红军有过“打土豪分田地”的光荣传统，今天要很好的继承并加以发扬。总部宣言号召我们要学会两套本领，歼灭敌人和唤起民众，唤起民众就是帮农民翻身。军队参加土地改革，可助长农民声势；并可增强军队的群众观点，亲密军民、军地（军队和地方）关系，提高指战员的阶级觉悟，大大加强军队战斗力。对军队本身整党、整军是个极重要的条件，因此军队应当极端重视这个政治任务的执行。罗副政委并提出了几个原则：（一）重新进行土地改革教育，扫除思想障碍，宣布侵犯人民利益治罪法和参加土地改革中的纪律，严禁阻挠破坏土地改革，包庇地主、富农的违法行为。（二）军队参加土地改革受地方党统一领导。（三）连队士兵委员会下设土地改革工作组，负责驻地土地调查、宣传、组织群众等工作。（四）野战军抽调好的干部、战士参加有关地区的土地改革工作团。（五）固定驻军的机关、学校与部队参加驻村土地改革工作。（六）一切部队、机关驻军均应动员全体人员参加群众大会诉苦，为农民助威，进行部队阶级教育，并可抽调一定人员参加邻近地方工作团。（七）在蒋区进行宣传与调查，条件成熟时，由政治机关协同地方组织工作队，发动群众。（八）在边缘区保护农民翻身斗争，担任警戒，掩护分地分浮财。（九）写家信：雇贫农战士鼓励家庭参加斗争，地主、富农出身的要劝说和警告家庭遵守土地法，服从新农会，不得有任何违法行为。（十）按解放战士分田办法，办理解放战士的登记和通知书。（十一）坚决镇压地主、富农可能产生的反革命武装叛乱。
    关于军队整党整军问题，罗副政委说：军队党内不纯，作风不正，同样是很严重的。有些领导环节上一时“挂帅”的是地主、富农，而不是我们的领导干部。
    对军队整党整军具体办法，罗副政委指出：（一）全军干部中开展查阶级、查思想、查作风的运动，战士中开展诉苦运动。（二）在重要领导机关和若干领导环节上，进行组织上的调整。（三）后方机关和生产部门把混进的阶级异己分子清洗出去。（四）思想蜕化贪污坠落分子，不经改正和考验，不能担负领导工作。（五）提高各级党委的权力，首长应服从党委的领导。（六）连队一切经过支部，使支部成为连队的最高领导机关。（七）连队与伙食单位成立士兵委员会，给予士兵以经济民主与政治民主，定期进行对干部党员的批评与鉴定，支部党员在连队公开，听取士兵大会对吸收党员与开除党员的意见；连队士兵委员会应以工人、雇贫农的优秀分子为骨干。
    【新华社晋察冀十一日电】冀中军区政治部顷命令全军参加土地改革运动。（甲）协助驻地村庄进行下列工作：（一）调查群众对土地改革的反映和地主、富农坏分子的破坏活动，及时反映到小区代表会，或贫农团代表会。（二）宣传土地法大纲及联合布告与告农民书。（三）如有地主富农及坏分子反抗、破坏土地改革，必须援助农民予以镇压。（四）协助贫农团、新农会一切决议的执行。（乙）以机关部队支部为单位，指定专人与贫农团、新农会发生关系（或临近的小区代表会），无条件的执行贫农团、新农会的决议，不准乱发生关系和包办代替、强迫命令以及和坏干部联系。各部队首长、各级党委、支部必须组织所有人员协助驻村的土地改革，把前述四项工作作为日常重要工作之一。命令中并规定了在土地改革期间，不准干涉群众斗争，及侵占斗争果实等纪律。
