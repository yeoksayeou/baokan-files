Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 13th: Late News: A certain unit of the local troops of the Jilin Military Region once entered Changchun city in two routes on New Year's Eve, and after severely defeating more than 600 Chiang bandits, they voluntarily withdrew. One route of our army first annihilated a Chiang bandit platoon in Yangjiadian, a suburb of Changchun, before New Year's Eve. At 10:00 PM on the 31st, it attacked the East Daqiao Railway Station in the city, and after fierce fighting until 9:00 AM on the 1st, annihilated the defending enemy, a company, as well as local police and Mongolian cavalry, totaling more than 500 people. Among them, more than 200 were killed or wounded and captured, and a large number of guns, ammunition, and war horses were seized. On the same day, another route of our army attacked Erdaohezi in the city, and after five hours of fierce fighting, captured more than 70 people and guns. Another unit of our army raided the Bali Fort area in the suburbs the day before New Year's Eve and fought the enemy for two hours, capturing more than 50 alive, seizing more than 100 rifles, more than 100 horses, and liberating 40 "prisoners." On the 31st, the battle continued to expand. More than 800 livestock and more than 9,000 stones of grain were obtained, and the livestock and all the grain were distributed to the local poor people.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: After the People's Liberation Army moved into Tutai Village, on the east bank of the Hun River on the outskirts of Shenyang, in less than half an hour, many sallow-faced and emaciated hungry people came with bags to ask the People's Liberation Army to distribute grain. As soon as they saw the comrades of the People's Liberation Army, they excitedly said: "My family hasn't had anything to cook for ten days." "If you don't come, we'd rather rob grain and be beaten to death by the landlord than starve to death with our eyes open." Recently, we once voluntarily held a meeting to discuss organizing all the people who have no food to force the landlords to lend grain, but the landlords knew about it and organized a large regiment to monitor us in the village. Fortunately, you came quickly." On the same day, more than 2,000 stones of grain and floating wealth from the four big landlords in Tutai Village were divided among the poor people, who accounted for more than 80% of the village's population. The masses immediately organized stretcher teams and rushed to the battlefield to actively support the People's Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Under the powerful winter offensive of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, the Chiang bandits in Shenyang were panicked. According to foreign news agencies, the families of Chiang bandit officials and technicians continued to flee Shenyang by plane. Bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek flew to Shenyang in a hurry on the 10th to preside over the so-called "emergency military meeting." Those attending the meeting included Fu Zuoyi, Chen Cheng, Du Yuming, Xiong Shihui, and other bandits. The Chiang bandit returned to Nanjing in a panic on the 12th.

    【新华社东北前线十三日电】迟到消息：吉林军区地方兵团某部曾于除夕二路进入长春市内，痛歼蒋匪六百余名后，主动撤出。我军一路首于除夕前于长春市郊杨家店歼灭蒋匪一个中队，三十一日夜十时即攻入该市东大桥车站，激战至一日晨九时，歼守敌一个连及当地警察与蒙古骑兵等共五百余名，其中毙伤及生俘各二百余名，缴获枪弹战马等甚多。同日我军另一路攻入市内二道河子，与敌激战五小时，俘获其人枪各七十余。我军另部则于除夕前一日奔袭市郊八里堡一带与敌战斗两小时，生俘其五十余，缴获步枪百余支，马百余匹，解放“犯人”四十余人。三十一日继续扩张战斗。又获牲口八百余匹，粮食九千余石，当即将牲口及全部粮食分给当地贫民。
    【新华社东北十三日电】解放军进驻沈阳外围浑河东岸的土台子后，不到半点钟，许多面黄肌瘦的饥民就都带着口袋找解放军要求分粮。他们一见到解放军同志就兴奋的说：“我家已经十天没揭锅了。”“你们再不来，我们宁可抢粮叫地主打死，也不能白瞪着眼饿死”。最近我们曾经自动开会商量过，要把所有没饭吃的人都组织起来，强迫地主借粮，可是地主们晓得了，组织了大团在村里监视我们，幸好你们来得快。”当天，土台子四家大地主的二千多石粮食和浮财，就都被占全村人口百分之八十以上的穷人分了，群众并马上组织了担架队涌上战场，积极支援解放军。
