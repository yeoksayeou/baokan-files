Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Tokyo dispatch: The surfacing of the split within the Japanese Social Democratic Party (i.e., the current ruling party) demonstrates the intensifying infighting among the Japanese reactionary ruling class. Former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the Katayama Cabinet, Rikizo Hirano, and fifteen other right-wing members of the Social Democratic Party, officially announced their departure from the party on the 5th. The Liberal Party also issued a statement on the 7th, declaring its decision to join forces with Hirano and other right-wing Social Democrats in a movement against the Katayama Cabinet when the parliament reconvenes on the 21st, further destabilizing the Katayama Cabinet. This cabinet has greatly weakened the position of the Social Democratic Party in the parliament (reduced from 143 seats to 124 seats, only three more than the Liberal Party). It is reported that Rikizo Hirano is the leading figure in the Japanese feudal fascist organization "Imperial Way Faction." Since Katayama dismissed him from the post of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry last November on the grounds of "failure to cooperate with the cabinet," he has been plotting to organize a new conservative party and engaging in activities to overthrow the cabinet with fascist bureaucrats Shigeru Yoshida and Kijuro Shidehara of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Tokyo dispatch: Inflation in Japan has reached an unprecedented level. At the first meeting of the "Banknote Issuance Committee" convened by Katayama at the end of last year, it was confirmed that the Bank of Japan has been printing an average of 10 billion yen worth of banknotes every month since last October. According to estimates by the Bank of Japan, the number of banknotes issued by the end of last December will reach 114 billion yen, nearly seven times the 31.2 billion yen at the time of Japan's surrender (note that the amount issued by the end of last June was 136 billion yen). Inflation has caused the dire consequence of skyrocketing prices. According to materials released by the Economic Research Section of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department on the 23rd of last month, Japanese prices soared by 35 percent in December last year. Katayama's inflationary policy will deepen his political and economic crisis.

　　日本当权派狗咬狗片山内阁坐不稳了
    【新华社陕北十三日电】东京讯：日本社会民主党（即现政府当权党）内部分裂的表面化，说明日本反动统治阶级内哄日烈。片山内阁前农相平野力三及其他十五名社会民主党右冀分子，已于五日正式宣布脱离该党。自由党又于七日发表声明：决定于二十一日议会重开后，联合平野等社会民主党右派参加反片山内阁的运动，更使片山内阁日趋不稳。此一内阁已使社会民主党在议会中的地位大为削弱（由一四三席灭为一二四席，较自由党仅多三席）。按平野力三系日本封建法西斯组织“皇道会”的主导人物，自去年十一月间片山以“未能与内阁合作”名义撤销其农相职位后，即阴谋组织新保守党，与自由党、民主党之法西斯官僚吉田茂、币原喜重郎等进行倒内阁活动。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】东京讯：日本之通货膨胀已达空前程度，片山于去年底召开之“钞票发行委员会”第一次会议上证实：自去年十月份起，日本银行每月平均印行一百亿日元的钞票。据日本银行估计：至去年十二月底，钞票发行数将达一千一百四十亿日元，较之日本投降时之三百十二亿，几增加七倍（按去年六月底发行额为一千三百六十亿）。通货膨胀已造成物价暴涨的恶果。据东京警视厅经济研究科上月二十三日公布的材料，去年十二月内日本物价剧涨百分之三十五。片山之通货膨胀政策将加深其政治与经济的危机。
