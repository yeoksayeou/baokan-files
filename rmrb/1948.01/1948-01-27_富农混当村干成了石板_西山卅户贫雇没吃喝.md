【Taiyue News】In Xishan Administrative Village, Jincheng Seventh District, after rent and interest reduction in 1942 and land reform in the years before and after last year, there are still hired and poor peasants being pressed under a "stone slab", living a difficult life. Seventeen households currently have nothing to eat, thirteen can only eat until the end of the lunar year, and others can only eat until the second month of spring. The reason why poor and hired peasants have not been able to turn over is mainly because the village's power is still controlled by rich peasant elements. Among the village cadres, there are twelve rich peasants; only two poor peasants, and they are not key cadres. Although poor and hired peasants also obtained some land and houses in the struggle last year, most of the fruits were monopolized by a few people. For example, more than sixty sheep were seized last year, but the poor and hired peasants didn't get one, and they were all divided up by five village cadres. During the land reform, the village cadres advocated "mobilizing" three mu of land from Li Erfu, and the political director Wei Dexin seized one mu of good land to plant, giving the poor and hired peasants small pieces of bad land to cultivate. The poor and hired peasants Mao Hai and Su Tang said, "We don't know how to cultivate good land!" The village cadres also distributed the fruits of labor to the targets of struggle. For example, the rich peasant Da Feng mixed into the women's association as a standing committee member. Her father-in-law committed great crimes and was beaten to death by the masses in struggle. Last year, the chairman of the farmers' association even gave her five sheep, more than one shi of grain, more than one mu of good land, and clothes. During the land reform, Wei Dexin obtained many houses. Although he gave two rooms to the masses, he asked the masses to repair the houses for him. The chairman of the farmers' association, Li Chengliang, beat six basic members of the masses during the mass movement, and many were detained. When the middle-lower peasant Li Xueru had some opinions on preferential treatment for resistance against the enemy, Li Chengliang heard about it and held a meeting the next day to completely criticize Li Xueru. From then on, the hired and poor peasants did not dare to say anything. There are many military families in the village, and the masses are too busy with substitute farming, so they also have to do substitute farming for the cooperative manager Wei Xuexin, which the masses are very dissatisfied with. This time, when they obtained a loan, they did not consult with the masses for the 200,000 loan and bought salt and sheep. When letting the masses burn charcoal, they did not explain how much money per jin, but only said, "Burning charcoal for a month without pay can be counted as a share." The masses did not dare not to do it, but they were very unmotivated. In the past, they could burn eighty to one hundred jin per day, but now they only burn twenty-five jin per day. The masses said, "One bowl of vegetables, vegetables in one bowl, it's just these few people after all."

　　富农混当村干成了石板
  　西山卅户贫雇没吃喝
    【太岳消息】晋城七区西山行政村经过四二年的减租减息和去年前年的土地改革，直到现在，还有雇贫农被压在石板底下，过着困苦的生活。有十七户眼下就没吃的，十三户可吃到旧历年底，其他还有的只能吃到春天二月。贫雇没有翻身，主要是因为村里大权还被富农分子掌握着。村干部里有富农十二个；只有两个贫农，还不是主要干部。去年斗争中贫雇农虽也得了一部分土地和房子，但大部分果实被少数人独占了。如去年斗出六十多个羊，贫雇农没得上一个，都被五个村干部分了。在土地改革时，村干部主张“动员”了李二富三亩地，政治主任卫德信就抢种了一亩好地，把两边的小块坏地给贫雇种了。贫雇农毛孩、宿堂说：“咱不会种好地！”村干部还给斗争对象分了果实，如富农大凤混进妇会当常委，他公公罪恶大被群众斗争打死了，去年农会主席还给她分了五个羊、一石多粮食、一亩多好地和衣服。土地改革时，卫德信得的房子多，虽给群众让出两间，可是又叫群众给他修房。农会主席李成亮在群运中打了六个基本群众，被扣过的很多。下中农李雪如对优抗上有些意见，李成亮听见，第二天开会就把李雪如斗光了。从此以后，雇贫啥话都不敢说了。村里军属很多，群众代耕都忙不过来，还得给合作社经理卫学信代耕，群众很不满意。这次贷款时，他们又把二十万贷款没有通过群众，买成盐及羊。让群众烧木炭，也不说明每斤多少钱，只说：“烧一月木炭不给钱，可以顶成股”。群众都不敢不干，干着又很没劲。过去每天能烧八十斤到一百斤，现在每天只烧二十五斤。群众说：“一碗菜，菜一碗，就是这几个人罢了”。
