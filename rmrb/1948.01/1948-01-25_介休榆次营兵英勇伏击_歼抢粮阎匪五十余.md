　　Jiexiu Yuci Militia Valiantly Ambush
  　Annihilating Over Fifty Grain-Robbing Yan Bandits
    [Taihang News] On the morning of January 14th, our Jiexiu Independent Battalion, in coordination with the militia rotation teams, laid an ambush between Donghulong, Bianzhuangtou, and Lianfudang in the second district of Jiexiu. At about 8 o'clock, over sixty men from the Yan puppet "Security 18th Regiment, 6th Company" from the Nanwangli stronghold went to Donghulong Village to rob grain. One group entered the village through the north gate, and the other group entered through the west gate. When more than thirty enemies entered the village, our 2nd Company Commander Zhang Sanhu used two simultaneous hand grenade explosions as a signal. The assault team bravely charged towards the enemy, showering them with grenades, throwing the enemy into chaos. The fleeing enemies were intercepted head-on by our brothers ambushing outside the village. The battle ended victoriously after fifteen minutes. The tally: four enemies killed, twelve enemies wounded, eighteen enemies captured alive (four squad leaders, fourteen soldiers), three machine guns seized, twelve rifles, five hundred rounds of ammunition, and 7 million Jiao currency.
    [Taihang News] On the 14th of this month, the Yuci Independent Battalion, in coordination with the militia, eliminated twenty-one Yan puppet soldiers in Doufuzhuang in the same county. Two companies and plainclothes team from the Yan puppet Eighth Column, First Regiment, Third Battalion, stationed in Nanyao Village, totaling more than two hundred people, came out to rob grain that day. Our battalion soldiers knew about it in advance and ambushed near Doufuzhuang. When the enemy approached our army, we immediately pounced on the enemy. After fighting for more than forty minutes, a total of fourteen enemies were killed or wounded, and seven enemies were captured alive (including a Taoist leader). Nine rifles, six bayonets, and more than two hundred rounds of ammunition were seized. Our side suffered no casualties.
