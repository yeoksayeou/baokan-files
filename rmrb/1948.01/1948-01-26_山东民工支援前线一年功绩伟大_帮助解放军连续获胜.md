Xinhua News Agency, East China, 23rd: The people of Shandong have continuously supported the front lines with a high degree of enthusiasm in the past year, helping the People's Liberation Army achieve continuous victories, recording a glorious page in the people's war. At the beginning of the year, during the great victory in Lunan, when the People's Liberation Army annihilated the enemy's First Rapid Column, the 26th Division, and the 51st Division, tens of millions of militiamen cleaned the battlefields, guarded and transported large quantities of American-style cannons, tanks, automobiles and other spoils of war. On the night of the 9th, heavy snow covered the highway, and the next morning the masses cleared the snow, making transportation as convenient as usual. In late February, during the Laiwu Campaign, when seven entire brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were annihilated, 500,000 militiamen, combat teams, and demolition teams directly served the battlefield. From central Shandong alone, 12,000 stretchers were dispatched. Transportation teams of vehicles and livestock moved day and night through the valleys. In a certain village, two twelve- or thirteen-year-old children climbed over a 700-meter-high mountain in the pitch-black night to guide the army. In a certain place along a tributary of the Wen River, women braved the biting cold wind and lit torches to illuminate the path for the troops. During the Mengshan blocking battle in late April, Gao Huanfu, the leader of the Penglai stretcher team, and Han Mingyang, the deputy leader, resolutely rescued the last two remaining wounded soldiers under the emergency circumstances where the troops and the stretcher team had already withdrawn, carrying them in one breath to the field hospital thirty miles away. When other laborers were transferring the wounded, they used their own rice bowls to hold the wounded's urine and feces along the way, spent money to buy eggs and white sugar for the wounded to eat, sheltered them from wind and rain, drove away flies, and did everything possible to take care of the wounded. In early May, when the 74th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits was annihilated at Menglianggu, hundreds of thousands of laborers went through all kinds of hardships and overcame various obstacles, everyone considering it a great honor to participate in this victory. At that time, the Wu Ma grain transportation team from Jiaonan County encountered high mountains and dangerous gorges, and automatically took off their clothes to wrap the grain. Each person carried fifty or sixty catties of grain, crossed dozens of miles of bumpy and difficult mountain roads, and then put it on carts to push, thus transporting the grain to the front in a timely manner. During the rainy season in July, the Juxian County South army-following transportation team pushed and pulled carts loaded with ammunition, battling the foot-deep mud and many large rivers on the road, covering the ammunition boxes with raincoats while getting wet themselves, and successfully completed each mission. When the Chen-Su army shifted to the outer lines for counter-offensive, a large number of laborers followed the army on its expedition.

　　In addition, a large number of laborers followed the Xu-Tan army, actively participating in the front lines of Jiaodong. As for the rear and the masses in the war zone, they grinded grain, baked pancakes, made military shoes, and sewed military uniforms for the front day and night. Many women and children also actively shouldered the heavy task of supporting the front in the rear. In the heroic and arduous support work, the political awareness of the participating laborers was further enhanced. The Juxian County South participating masses, who were honored as the "Steel Transportation Team," had 700 members gloriously join the Communist Party, and a large number of other members joined the New Democratic Youth League.

　　山东民工支援前线一年功绩伟大
  　帮助解放军连续获胜
    【新华社华东二十三日电】山东人民在过去一年内不断以高度的积极性支援前线，帮助解放军连续获得胜利，记录下人民战争的伟大一页。年初鲁南大捷，解放军歼灭敌第一快速纵队、整廿六师和五十一师时，成千万民兵打扫战场，看守和搬运大批得美式大炮、坦克、汽车等胜利品。九日夜间大雪埋住公路，第二天一早群众就把积雪打扫干净，使交通运输便利如常。二月下旬莱芜战役，歼灭蒋匪七个整旅时，五十万民兵参战队、爆炸队等直接服务战地，仅鲁中即出动担架一万二千付。运输队的车辆、牲口浩浩荡荡地日夜流动山谷。某村两个十二、三岁的儿童漆黑夜爬过七百多公尺高的山岭给军队带路。汶水支流某地妇女冒着刺骨的冷风，点起火把给队伍照亮。四月下旬蒙山阻击战中，蓬莱担架队分队长高焕富、小队长韩明扬，在部队和担架队都已撤走的紧急情况下，仍坚决地抢救最后留下的两名伤员，一口气背到三十里外的野战医院。其他民工们在转运伤员时，一路上拿自己的饭瓢给伤员盛大小便，出钱买鸡蛋、白糖给伤员吃，遮风雨、赶苍蝇，用尽一切办法照顾伤员。五月上旬孟良崮歼灭蒋匪七十四师时，几十万民工历尽千辛万苦，克服各种险阻，大家都以能参加这次胜仗为极大光荣。当时胶（县）南吴马运粮队碰到高山险峡，自动脱下衣服包装粮食，每人背粮食五、六十斤，翻过几十里凹凸难走的山路，然后再放上小车推送，这样轮番转运，终于将粮食及时送到前方。七月雨季，莒（县）南随军担运队推拉着装满弹药的小车，跟公路上尺把深的烂泥和许多条大水博斗，拿蓑衣盖弹药箱，自己淋雨，每次任务都胜利完成。当陈粟大军转入外线反攻时，大批民工随军出征。
    另有大批民工则随许谭大军活跃胶东前线。至于后方及战地群众日夜为前方磨粮食、烙煎饼、做军鞋、缝军衣，许多妇女儿童也都积极担负了后方繁重的支前任务。在英勇艰苦的支援工作中，参战民工的政治觉悟更提高了，荣获“钢铁担运队”的莒（县）南参战群众，已有七百名队员光荣地加入了共产党，另有大批队员参加新民主主义青年团。
