To all farmer brothers and sisters in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region!

　　For the past two years, our border region has carried out a vigorous land reform movement. About ten million people in the entire border region have been completely liberated, but about twenty million people have not been thoroughly liberated, only half-liberated, or only nominally liberated.

　　Now things are better. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China promulgated the Outline Land Law of China on October 10th last year, which is perfect and will guarantee that every one of our farmers will be completely liberated.

　　In the past, we made mistakes in implementing the "Land to the Tiller" movement in our border region. Some leading organs, groups, and cadres of the troops, either because they themselves were landlords or rich peasants, or because they were not landlords or rich peasants but listened to the opinions of landlords and rich peasants, intentionally or unintentionally shielded some landlords and rich peasants. Some leading organs, groups, and cadres of the troops excessively emphasized taking care of the families of military personnel, cadres, and martyrs. As a result, some landlords and rich peasants among the families of military personnel, cadres, and martyrs were not struggled against or were not struggled against thoroughly. Some families of military personnel, cadres, and martyrs, although not landlords or rich peasants, also received too much fruit. Some places used to distribute the fruits based on problems, whether one was in the farmers' association, and whether one was active in the struggle, resulting in an unfair distribution of fruits, with a few people getting more and most people getting less. In particular, some cadres and activists took advantage of their positions to seize more fruits. As a result, some landlords and rich peasants were not thoroughly struggled against, and even if some landlords and rich peasants were thoroughly struggled against, the distribution of fruits was very unfair, and the poor and hired peasants were still not completely and thoroughly liberated.

　　The Outline Land Law can precisely correct the above faults. Articles 1 to 3 clearly stipulate that all feudal and semi-feudal exploitative land systems must be abolished, and a "Land to the Tiller" land system must be implemented. That is to say, regardless of whether you are a family of military personnel, cadres, and martyrs, or whether you are a county magistrate, commander, or high-ranking cadre, no exceptions are allowed. As long as it is feudal or semi-feudal exploitation, it must be thoroughly abolished and must not be shielded. Article 6 of the Outline Land Law also clearly stipulates that land and property should be uniformly and equally distributed according to population. The method is simple and clear: those with problems get a share, those without problems also get a share, those with merits get a share, those without merits also get a share, landlords are also given a share, and rich peasants are also allowed to keep a share. Some of the middle peasants will have to take out some land, some will have to be allocated some land and property, and the rest will remain largely unchanged. Those who have not been equally distributed in the past must be leveled out, and those who have gained too much must return it. The method of extracting from the excess and supplementing the deficient, extracting from the fat and supplementing the lean must be used to truly achieve leveling and replenishment, so that no one gets more and no one gets less.

　　Who should we rely on to fight against landlords and rich peasants? Who should we rely on to fairly and reasonably distribute land and property? Needless to say, everyone knows that we rely on the peasants themselves to organize and fight, and to distribute land and property themselves. But in this regard, we also made mistakes in the past, that is, the ranks of our peasants were not pure and were not well organized. In some places, landlords, rich peasants, and ruffians sneaked in and seized our leadership, and the poor and hired peasants were instead slandered as "backward elements." How could such a team thoroughly fight feudalism? How could it fairly distribute land and property? In some places, the peasants themselves did not take charge, and everything relied on government staff or cadres from outside to move stones and fight feudalism. As a result, the landlords and rich peasants were fought for a while, but the poor and hired peasants were confused and still not liberated. The Outline Land Law can correct this mistake. Article 5 clearly stipulates that the poor peasant leagues, farmers' associations, and farmer representative conferences are the legal administrative organs for equalizing land distribution. They have the right and power to take the power into the hands of our peasants themselves. No one can restrict them, and no one can infringe on them.

　　How to organize the poor peasant leagues? What is the relationship between them and the farmers' associations? This issue must be clarified. Simply put, poor peasants, hired peasants, rural workers, and other poor people can form poor peasant leagues. They are the backbone, leaders, and main force in carrying out land reform. Then, by linking up with all the middle peasants, we can form farmers' associations, which is the joint army for carrying out land reform. The poor peasant league is the general staff headquarters, which is extremely important. The election of poor peasant league officers must be very serious. We must elect those who have worked for many years, are upright, selfless, and wholeheartedly serve everyone. The election of farmer association officers is also the same, but a few good middle peasants should be added. For members, we must self-report and publicly discuss, compare each other, determine composition, and compare good and bad, so that landlords, rich peasants, and ruffians cannot sneak in.

　　Why must land reform rely on poor and hired peasants to organize poor peasant leagues? Because poor and hired peasants now account for 50 to 70 percent of the rural population. They are the most numerous, working all year round. They till the land, build the houses, and weave the cloth. But they often have no food to eat, no house to live in, and no clothes to wear. They live the hardest lives. They are the most oppressed, the most exploited, and the most despised. Therefore, poor and hired peasants are the most revolutionary. They are born as the revolutionary class. They are naturally the leaders of the liberation movement. Relying on poor and hired peasants is a matter of course. But can we despise or slightly despise the issue of consolidating and uniting the middle peasants? This is absolutely not allowed. Middle peasants are also numerous, now accounting for more than 20 percent of the rural population. They are naturally one family with poor and hired peasants. They are also exploited and oppressed by landlords. They also agree with equalizing land distribution. Without them to participate in the struggle against landlords and rich peasants, the poor and hired peasants will be isolated and will not be able to defeat the resistance of landlords and rich peasants. In the past, we did not understand clearly who we must rely on, who we must unite with, who leads, and who participates. We also did not have such a complete set of organizations, so we had no strength in the struggle.

　　We must strictly prevent landlords and rich peasants from undermining the unity of our peasants. This time, when we re-examine the implementation of land reform and the equal distribution movement, landlords and rich peasants will definitely sow discord and undermine the unity of our peasants. Some people are openly landlords and rich peasants, standing outside us to sow discord and undermine unity. Some people pretend to be our own people (such as landlords, rich peasants, and their lackeys who have infiltrated the ranks of district and village cadres), standing inside us to sow discord and undermine unity. Both types of people are equally bad. We must always be vigilant and prevent being deceived. Our peasants must not undermine their own unity. Whoever sows discord among the peasants and makes them disunited is committing a crime. It is forbidden to attack poor and hired peasants, it is forbidden to exclude middle peasants, and it is forbidden to create disharmony and conflicts between streets, villages, the Zhang family and the Li family, and this religion and that religion. Those who dare to disobey will be severely punished and will not be forgiven.

　　Land reform is a sacred and inviolable cause. The feudal and semi-feudal exploitative land system must be eliminated. If anyone resists or sabotages it, no mercy will be shown, and they must be sent to the people's court for severe punishment. No matter who he is, landlords and rich peasants go without saying, even if he is a group cadre, a government cadre, a military cadre, or a Communist Party member, as long as he sabotages land reform, he will be arrested and handed over to the people's court for severe punishment.

　　Those who protect and support landlords and rich peasants and openly obstruct and sabotage land reform must be opposed. Those who pretend to oppose landlords and rich peasants but secretly engage in activities that harm the interests of peasants must be opposed. Those who surrender and compromise with landlords and rich peasants must be opposed. Those who act as air-raid shelters for landlords must be opposed. Those who encroach on, steal, and waste the fruits of struggle must also be opposed. Those who, under the pretext of suppressing landlords and rich peasants, kill and disrupt their own peasant ranks must be opposed even more.

　　This outline also clearly stipulates that the government is responsible for effectively guaranteeing the people's democratic rights, guaranteeing our peasants the right to criticize and impeach all cadres at all levels in all aspects, and the right to remove and elect all cadres of the government and peasant organizations. No one is allowed to infringe on these basic rights of the people. We must not only liberate ourselves economically, but also politically. A government that cannot guarantee the people's political freedom and democratic rights, we must rise up and transform it. We must not only control the poor peasant leagues and farmers' associations in our own hands, but also control the rural militia armed forces and rural political power in our own hands. We must support good cadres and remove bad cadres. We must also place the Communist Party under our supervision. We must control our own destiny in our own hands. We shout: "All power to the Farmer Representative Conference!"

　　After the completion of land reform, we must also establish a people's representative conference regime from bottom to top. People's governments are elected by people's representative conferences at all levels. Except for reactionaries and those who have been deprived of their civil rights, all may participate in the elections of people's representative conferences at all levels, which is the highest authority in the liberated areas. In the countryside, the farmer representative conference is the highest authority in the countryside. This will ensure that the power is in the hands of our peasants. Peasants are also completely liberated politically.

　　The Outline Land Law of China was promulgated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region issued a letter to party members. The border region government issued a proclamation on the implementation of the Outline Land Law of China and supplementary measures, and promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Crimes Against Land Reform and the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Corruption. The military region issued an order to the army to implement the Outline Land Law of China. From now on, no one can obstruct and sabotage land reform.

　　Our preparatory committee was elected by the all-region land conference last December and is dedicated to preparing all matters for the all-region farmer representative conference. This preparatory committee is temporary. Once the border region farmers' association is officially established and takes charge of all matters in the entire border region, our task will be completed.

### 晋冀鲁豫边区农会筹备委员会　告农民书

专栏：

　　晋冀鲁豫边区农会筹备委员会
  　告农民书全边区农民兄弟姐妹们！
    两年以来，我们边区曾进行了轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动，全边区约有一千万人口已经彻底翻身，但还约有两千万人口翻身不很彻底，翻了半个身，或者只翻了个空身。
    现在好了，中共中央于去年十月十日公布了中国土地法大纲，尽美尽善，它将保证我们每个农民都彻底翻身。
    过去我们边区在实行耕者有其田运动中出了毛病。有些领导机关、团体和部队的干部，或者他自己本身是地主、富农出身、或者他虽不是地主、富农出身，但是他听了地主、富农的议论，有意无意的包庇了一部分地主、富农；有些领导机关、团体和部队的干部，过分强调照顾军干烈属，因而某些军干烈属的地主、富农，没有斗或者斗的不彻底，某些军干烈属虽不是地主、富农，他们也多分了果实；有些地方曾经是按问题、按在不在农会、按斗争积极不积极分果实，结果果实分的不公道，少数人多得，多数人少得。特别有些干部积极分子，利用自己地位，多占了果实。这样一来，有些地主、富农没有斗彻底，有些地主、富农虽然斗的很彻底了，但果实分配的很不公平，贫雇农仍然没有完全彻底翻身。
    土地法大纲恰恰可以纠正以上毛病，第一条至第三条明白规定，废除一切封建性半封建性剥削的土地制度，实行耕者有其田的土地制度。那就是说，不管你是军干烈属也好，不管你是县长、司令、大干部也好，都不准例外，只要是封建性半封建性的剥削，就都得彻底废除，不得包庇。土地法大纲第六条又明白规定，土地财产是按人口统一平均分配，办法简单明了，有问题的分一份，没有问题的也分一份，有功劳的分一份，没有功劳的也分一份，给地主也同样分一份，给富农也同样留一份，中农有一部分要拿出一些土地，有一部分要分进一些土地和财产，另一部分则大体不动。过去没有分平的要填平，多得的要退出，就是用抽多补少、抽肥补瘦的办法，真正做到填平补齐，谁也不多，谁也不少为止。
    依靠谁来和地主、富农作斗争，依靠谁来公平合理的分配土地和财产呢？不用说，这是大家知道的，是靠咱们农民自己组织起来，自己去进行斗争，自己去分配土地和财产。可是在这一点上，咱们过去也出了毛病，就是咱们农民自己的队伍不纯洁，组织不好。有些地方地主、富农、流氓钻进来了，窃取了咱们的领导权，贫雇农民反而被诬蔑为“落后分子”，这样的队伍，哪里能把封建斗彻底？哪里能把土地财产分公平？有些地方农民自己不当家，全靠政府外来工作人员或者人家干部搬石头、斗封建，结果地主、富农是被斗了一阵，可是贫雇农民莫明其妙，仍未翻身。土地法大纲就能纠正这个毛病，它在第五条上明白规定，贫农团、农会、农代会为平分土地的合法办事机关，它有权有力，把大权拿在咱们农民自己手里，谁也不能限制它，谁也不能侵犯它。
    如何组织贫农团、它和农会的关系怎么样？这个问题要弄清楚。简单说，贫农、雇农、乡村工人加上其它贫民，就可以组成贫农团，这是进行土地改革的骨干、领导者、也是主力。再由它串连全体中农，就可以组成农会，这是进行土地改革的联合大军。贫农团是参谋部，顶重要。选举贫农团办事人，要十分认真，要选举长年劳动的、为人正派的、大公无私的、一心给大家办事的。选举农会办事人也是一样，不过要加几个好的中农进来。对团员、会员要自报公议，互相比较，定成份，比好坏，不让地主、富农和流氓混进来。
    为什么土地改革一定要依靠贫农雇农组织贫农团呢？因为，贫农雇农他们现在占乡村人口百分之五十到七十，他们人数最多，长年劳动，地是他们种的，房子是他们盖的，布是他们织的，但他们常常没饭吃、没房住、没衣穿，他们生活最苦，他们最受压迫、最受剥削、最为人所轻视，所以贫农雇农最革命，天生的是革命阶级，他们天然是翻身运动的带头人。依靠贫农雇农是天经地义。但可不可以轻视或者稍微轻视巩固团结中农的问题呢？这，坚决地不可以。中农人数也不少，他们现在占乡村人口百分之二十以上，与贫农雇农天生是一家，一样受地主剥削、压迫，他们也很赞成平分土地。没有他们来参加反对地主、富农的斗争，贫农雇农就要陷于孤立，就不能很好的打败地主、富农的反抗。过去我们就因为没有闹清楚，必须依靠谁，必须团结谁、谁带头、谁参加，也没有这样一套完整的组织，所以斗争起来没有力量。
    要严防地主、富农破坏咱们农民的团结，我们这次复查土地改革贯彻平分运动，地主、富农一定会从中挑拨离间，破坏咱们农民的团结。一种人是公开的地主、富农面貌，站在咱们外面挑拨离间，破坏团结；一种人是装成自己人（如混进区村干部行列中的地主、富农及其狗腿），站在咱们里面挑拨离间，破坏团结。两种人一样坏，要时刻留神，严防上当。咱们农民更不要自己破坏自己团结，谁要挑拨农民内部不和气、不一心，就是犯罪。不准打击贫农、雇农，不准排斥中农，不准制造街与街、村与村、张家与李家、这教和那教的不和与冲突，如敢违抗，要受到严厉制裁，决不宽恕。
    土地改革是神圣不可侵犯的事业，封建性和半封建性剥削的土地制度一定要消灭了，如果有人反抗和破坏，决不留情，一定要送交人民法庭严厉制裁。不管他是什么人，地主、富农固不用多说，就是团体干部也好，政府干部也好，军队干部也好，共产党员也好，只要是破坏土地改革的，就把他抓起来，交人民法庭，严予制裁。
    庇护和支持地主、富农，公然阻碍和破坏土地改革的要反对。表面上装着反对地主、富农的样子，暗地里进行损害农民利益勾当的人要反对。向地主富农投降妥协的要反对。替地主做防空洞的要反对。侵占、窃取和浪费斗争果实的也要反对。借口镇压地主、富农，杀乱了农民自己阵营的人更要反对。
    这个大纲又明白规定，政府负责切实保障人民的民主权利，保障咱们农民有批评和弹劾各方面各级的一切干部的权利。有撤换和选举政府和农民团体的一切干部的权利。不容许任何人侵犯人民的这种基本权利。我们不仅要在经济上翻身，也要在政治上翻身。不能保障人民的政治自由和民主权利的政府，我们就要起来改造它。我们不仅要把贫农团、农会掌握在我们自己手里，也要把乡村民兵武装、乡村政权都掌握到我们自己手里。拥护好干部，撤换坏干部。我们还要把共产党也放在我们的监督之下。我们要把我们自己的命运掌握在我们自己手里。我们高呼：“一切权力归农代会”。
    土地改革完成后，还要自下而上的建立人民代表会议的政权。由各级人民代表会选举人民的政府。各级人民代表会除反动分子和被褫夺了公民权的人以外，均可参加选举，它是解放区的最高权力机关。在乡村里说，农民代表会就是乡村里的最高权力机关。这样就做到把政权掌握在咱们农民手里。农民就在政治上也彻底翻身了。
    中国土地法大纲，是中共中央公布的，中共晋冀鲁豫中央局发表了告党员书，边区政府出了执行中国土地法大纲的布告和补充办法，公布了破坏土地改革治罪暂行条例和惩治贪污暂行条例，军区给军队下了执行中国土地法大纲的命令，以后谁也不能阻碍和破坏土地改革了。
    我们这个筹备会，是去年十二月全区土地会议推选的，专门筹备全区农民代表大会的一切事宜。这个筹备会是临时的，一俟边区农会正式成立，把全边区的事情管起来以后，我们的任务就结束了。
