　　Over the past week, news has come of the further upsurge of democratic forces in the Far East, and news has come of the European people fiercely resisting the Marshall Plan of enslavement. At the same time, people have also seen how frightened and weak American imperialism appears under the counterattack of the people of the world.
　　In the Far East, the Indonesian people continue to persist in the national liberation war, stubbornly and painfully striking the Dutch aggressor troops on various battlefields. A movement against the Dutch imperialist conspiracy of division is rising throughout the country. In areas occupied by the Dutch, such as Bandung, people are risking their lives to hold demonstrations everywhere, shouting, "Dutch aggressors get out of our city!" "Down with the traitors!" The firm voice of Indonesian Communist Party Secretary Daweiman, calling on the 70 million Indonesian people to unite and fight to the end, has spread throughout the country. Daweiman clearly pointed out the future of the Indonesian people's inevitable victory and the Dutch imperialists' inevitable defeat. This firm belief and this call will surely inspire the Indonesian people to carry out a more heroic struggle. At the same time, the Philippine People's Liberation Army responded to the shameless ultimatum of Philippine traitor Roxas for "unconditional surrender" with a wider range of attacks, and its area of activity has extended to within only thirty kilometers of Manila. Tarak, the leader of the People's Liberation Army, stated in a statement his determination to fight until Roxas surrenders. According to last week's news, the Burmese Communist Party has established democratic regimes in central Burma and other places, and insists on the armed struggle for the independence and liberation of the Burmese people. All of this, together with the comprehensive victorious offensive of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, marks the struggle of the people of the Far East against imperialism and feudalism, which is developing on an unprecedented scale.
　　Faced with this situation, American imperialism is greatly frightened and uneasy. Now American imperialism is desperately transfusing blood to the Netherlands, and new US-Dutch loan negotiations are underway in Washington. At the same time, American imperialism is tightening its protection of Japanese fascists. War-monger MacArthur is supporting the underground fascist government of Japanese warlords, preparing to make a comeback. The Far East Economic Subcommittee under American control has also decided to increase Japan's steel production. After releasing major war criminals such as Yoshisuke Ayukawa and Chikuhei Nakajima, Kinan, the prosecutor of the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, proposed to release more than 20 major war criminals. This move exposed before the people of the world how ugly, how isolated, and how weak American imperialism is, so that in order to vainly attempt to stop the further upsurge of the Far Eastern people's liberation movement, they have had to employ these Japanese war criminals who are deeply hated by the people.
　　In Europe, the struggle against the Marshall Plan, directly and indirectly, is unfolding and deepening universally. In Italy, the Sixth Congress of the Italian Communist Party announced its victorious conclusion under the powerful call to strengthen the unity of the working class, expose the conspiracy of war-mongers, and resolutely resist the provocations of American imperialism and its running dogs against the Italian people. Under the leadership of the Italian Communist Party, the Italian people's movement is increasingly powerfully impacting the Gasperi regime, which is pinning its last hope on the Marshall Plan. In places such as Piacenza, Verona, Visaro, and Gala Sarro, farmers and agricultural workers demanding land reform overcame police suppression, occupied the land of landlords, and organized their own management institutions - land committees. All this shows that the new high tide of Italian democracy against imperialism has sufficient conditions and a solid foundation to move towards victory.
　　In France, represented by aircraft industry workers and textile workers who are facing the pain of work stoppages and unemployment due to being threatened by the Marshall Plan, they continue to resolutely resist this enslavement plan, and have gained the participation of farmers. The French Communist Party convened a meeting of farmer representatives, angrily protesting the Schumann government's treasonous "Franco-American Bilateral Agreement" and the harmful heavy tax policies. The fact that French farmers have risen up to fight against enslavement and for democratic freedom is an important feature and noteworthy trend of the deepening French people's movement.
　　In Germany, which is the center of the Marshall Plan, the American and British occupation authorities' conspiracy to split the country by deciding to establish a West German puppet government at the Frankfurt Conference has been unanimously denounced by the German people. The people's movement demanding democratic reunification of Germany is flourishing, and the anti-hunger strike wave sweeping the British occupation zone and spreading to the American occupation zone proves that the workers in western Germany have already begun to generally rise up to struggle under the mobilization of the German Communist Party's slogan of "No work without food." This is an important part of the German democratic independence movement, and it will also be a powerful factor in promoting the final failure of the Marshall Plan.
　　The disastrous "Marshall Plan" has also been resisted by the broad masses of the people in the United States. Even the reactionary New York Times has had to admit: "The people of the American Midwest have expressed opposition to the Marshall Plan."
　　On the other hand, the US Congress is endlessly discussing the "Marshall Plan" and has encountered many difficulties. Even many reactionary Republican and Democratic congressmen have expressed doubts, or dare not openly support it, or have even expressed opposition. According to Republican reactionary leader Vandenberg's announcement on the 6th, the figure of "17 billion US dollars" originally stipulated for aid to Europe under the Marshall Plan is to be cancelled. The semi-official US news agency even reported that Vandenberg had even suggested that the four-year Marshall Plan would not be discussed in Congress. The British Worker's Daily commented on this: "The promise of Marshall's 'four-year aid' is now gradually turning into zero." This at least shows that the so-called Marshall's four-year aid plan has the possibility of miscarriage. The reason why the Marshall Plan has encountered such resistance in the US Congress is mainly because this plan has been opposed by the broad masses of the people inside and outside the United States. Even the reactionary newspapers of Western European countries such as Britain, Denmark, and the Netherlands have expressed anxiety and opposition because the aggressive nature of the Marshall Plan has "become more and more obvious" (TASS). Even Bevin, the servant of American imperialism who had actively campaigned for this, had to express some "negative" views due to the pressure of the British people and other reasons. Secondly, some people within the US ruling class, on the one hand, in order to win the presidential votes this year, are unwilling to be responsible for this "loss of popular support" plan and suffer the future punishment of the American people; on the other hand, they are afraid that this plan will throw a large amount of money into the water because of their own serious economic difficulties and fear of the "rapidly changing situation in certain European countries" (Labor News). In short, the future of the Marshall enslavement plan, which dreams of exchanging the enslavement of Western European countries at a small price and escaping its own economic crisis, is becoming more and more bleak.

### 远东人民革命运动空前发展欧洲工农反美斗争普遍深入

　　远东人民革命运动空前发展欧洲工农反美斗争普遍深入
    过去一周，传来了远东民主力量更加高涨的消息，传来了欧洲人民猛烈抗击马歇尔奴役计划的消息。同时，人们也看到了，在世界人民的反击下，美帝国主义表现得如何恐惧和软弱。
    在远东，印尼人民继续坚持民族解放战争，在各战场上顽强地痛击荷兰侵略军。一个反对荷兰帝国主义分裂阴谋的运动，正在全国兴起。荷占区万隆等地的人民，冒着生命危险，到处举行示威，高喊“荷兰侵略者滚出我们的城市！”“打倒卖国贼！”全国到处传遍了印尼共产党书记达维曼号召印尼七千万人民团结一致抗战到底的坚决声音。达维曼明确地指出了印尼人民必胜与荷兰帝国主义必败的前途。这一坚定信念，这一召唤，必将鼓舞印尼人民进行更英勇的斗争。与此同时，菲律宾人民解放军以更广泛的攻击来回答菲奸罗哈斯“无条件投降”的无耻通牒，活动地区已伸展到距马尼拉仅三十公里。人民解放军领袖塔拉克在声明中，表明非打到罗哈斯投降不止的决心。另据上周消息，缅共已在缅甸中部等地成立了民主政权，坚持缅甸人民独立解放的武装斗争。这一切，配合着中国人民解放军的全面胜利进攻，标志远东人民反帝反封建的斗争，正以空前的规模发展着。
    面对着这一形势，美帝国主义大为恐惧和不安。现在美帝国主义正拼命替荷兰输血，美荷新的贷款谈判，正在华府进行中。同时，美帝国主义更加紧卵翼日本法西斯。战争贩子麦克阿瑟正扶植日本军阀的地下法西斯政府，准备卷土重来。在美国控制下的远东经济小组委员会，亦决议增加日本钢产量。而东京战犯法庭检察长季楠继释放鲇川义介、中岛知久平等主要战犯之后，又提议释放主要战犯二十多名，这一举动，在世界人民面前暴露了美帝国主义是如此丑恶，如此孤立，如此软弱，以至为了妄图阻止远东人民解放运动的进一步高涨，他们已只好起用这些为人民所深恶痛绝的日本战犯了。
    在欧洲，直接间接反对马歇尔计划的斗争，正普遍展开与深入中。在意大利，意共六代大会在加强工人阶级团结、揭穿战争贩子阴谋、和坚决反抗美帝国主义及其走狗对意大利人民的挑衅的强有力号召下，宣告胜利闭幕了。在意共领导下，意大利人民运动正日益有力地冲击着把最后一线希望寄托在马歇尔计划的加斯贝利政权。在配森萨、未罗那、比莎洛及加拉萨罗等地，要求土地改革的农民与农业工人，战胜了警察的镇压、占领了地主的土地，并且组织了自己的经营机构——土地委员会。这一切显示：意大利民主反帝新高潮之走向胜利，具有充分的条件和坚实的基础。
    在法国，以受马歇尔计划威胁而面临停工失业之痛苦的飞机业工人与纺织业工人为代表，继续对这一奴役计划作坚决反抗，而且获得了农民的参加。法共召开的农民代表会议，愤怒地抗议舒曼政府卖国的“法美双边协定”与害民的重税政策。法国农民起来为反奴役和争取民主自由而斗争，这是法国人民运动日益深入的重要特征，和值得注意的动向。
    在作为马歇尔计划中心的德国，美英占领当局在佛兰克福会议上决议成立西德傀儡政府的分裂阴谋，已受到德国人民的一致声讨，要求德国民主统一的人民运动正蓬勃展开，而席卷英占区并波及美占区的反饥饿的罢工浪潮，证明德国西部工人已经在德共“没有吃就不作工”的口号动员下，已开始普遍起来进行斗争了。这是德国民主独立运动的一个重要部分，也将是促使马歇尔计划最后失败的一个有力的因素。
    招致灾难的“马歇尔计划”，在美国国内也遭受了广大人民的抗拒，甚至连反动的纽约时报也不得不承认：“美中西部人民对马歇尔计划表示反对。”
    另一方面，美国国会正在哓哓不休的讨论“马歇尔计划”，而且遇到了重重困难。甚至连许多反动的共和与民主两党议员，也表示疑虑，或不敢公开支持，或竟表示反对。据共和党反动头子范登堡于六日宣布：马歇尔计划原规定援欧款项“一百七十亿美元”的数字，拟予以取销。美国半官方通讯社，甚至报导范登堡且曾建议：为期四年的马歇尔计划，将不在国会中讨论。英国工人日报曾对此评称：“马歇尔‘四年援助’之诺言，现已逐渐化成零了”。这至少已显示所谓马歇尔四年援欧计划已存在着流产的可能。马歇尔计划之所以在美国会内即遭受如此阻力，主要原因是由于这一计划遭受了美国内外广大人民的反对，甚至英国、丹麦、荷兰等西欧等国的反动报纸，也因马歇尔计划侵略性的“更益变得明显”（塔斯社）而表示忧惧而反对。即使曾为此而积极奔波的美帝国主义的从仆贝文，也在英国人民的压力等原因下，而不得不表示有些“消极”。其次，美统治阶级内部的一部分人，一方面为了争取今年的总统选票，不愿为这一“丧失民心”的计划负责，而遭受美国人民的未来惩罚；另一方面，他们因本身经济的严重困难，兼之恐惧欧洲“某些国家局势的急转直下”（劳动报），害怕这个计划会把大批金元投到水里去。总之这个梦想以少的代价来换取对西欧各国的奴役，并逃避本国的经济危机的马歇尔奴役计划，其前途的黯淡，是愈来愈明显了。
