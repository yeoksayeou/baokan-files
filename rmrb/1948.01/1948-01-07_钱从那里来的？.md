    Taiyue Branch Agency dispatch of the 4th: Nan Mingwen, the manager of the cooperative in Xiagzhuang Village, Qin County (also the chairman of the village's various salvation associations), his father died twenty years ago, and his mother remarried to Wu Yuanfan, a big landlord in Nanren Village. During the land reform movement, his mother was executed by the masses. Nan Mingwen moved his mother's corpse back on December 19th of last year to be buried with his father, which is enough to show a loss of position, and a huge waste, costing a piece of grave land, using more than 12 *shi* of rice and flour to build a stone tomb, and spending more than 13 *shi* of patterned rice and wheat for the funeral. A large number of relatives, friends, and neighbors were involved, consuming more than ten *shi* of rice and flour. He hired a music band and made paper crafts worth 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, bought sixteen or seventeen packs of cigarettes and more than thirty packs of dry tobacco. He spent more than 100,000 yuan to slaughter a fat pig, offer sacrifices, and treat guests with five big bowls of food. On the day before the funeral and on the day of the burial, more than 280 cadres and people from all levels in the village participated. From beginning to end, for more than half a month, a total of more than 800 units of labor were wasted. The village cadres were busy arranging the funeral for Nan Mingwen, neglecting to lead the masses in production, and until now the winter production in this village is still at a standstill.

　　钱从那里来的？
    太岳分社四日来电：沁县下庄村合作社经理南明文（兼村各救会主席），他父亲在二十年前死了，他母亲改嫁给南仁村大地主吴园藩。在土地改革运动中其母被群众处死。南明文就在去年十二月十九日，把他母亲的死尸搬回，和他父亲合葬，已够丧失立场，而且大大浪费，费了一块坟地，用米面十二石多打幕砌石，出葬花米麦十三石多。大动亲戚朋友四邻，吃喝米面十几石。雇音乐队做纸扎花三、四万元，买纸烟十六、七条，旱烟三十多包。花十万多元杀肥猪一口，上供请客吃五大碗。在出殡前一天和埋葬那天，村里各级干部和群众有二百八十多人参加。从开始到最后半个多月，共浪费民力八百多个。村干部忙着给南明文办丧事，放下领导群众生产，到现在这个村的冬季生产还在停着。
