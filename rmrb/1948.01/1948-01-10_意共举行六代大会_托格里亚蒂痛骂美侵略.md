　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Reports from Milan: The Italian Communist Party's Sixth National Congress solemnly opened in Milan on the 5th. Attending were 800 delegates representing 2.25 million Italian Communist Party members. Fraternal parties from various countries also sent delegations to attend. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti, in a speech that lasted "six hours without showing any fatigue," vehemently denounced the American imperialist and Vatican policies aimed at enslaving Italy. Togliatti pointed out: "The United States has turned Italy into a beachhead for its anti-Soviet conspiracy. To this end, it is exerting pressure on the Roman government and has found rampant accomplices within the Roman government." Togliatti pointed out that the Gasperi government is manipulated and exploited by American imperialism. This government will soon sell Italy to the United States, and therefore, Italy is in danger of being enslaved and turned into a foreign tool. After pointing out that "the Vatican is another major enemy of Italy," Togliatti emphasized that the Italian working people and the Communist Party resolutely oppose the establishment of a European bloc and advocate establishing friendly relations and trade relations with all countries, especially Eastern European countries, to avoid making Italy a pawn of any country. Togliatti went on to denounce American imperialism and the Vatican as the world's biggest warmongers. He pointed out that the danger of war is the result of the American program of expansion and world hegemony, with the Vatican as its accomplice. But Togliatti said with confidence that the democratic forces of the world today are stronger than the warmongers. As long as peace-loving nations are not intimidated and rise up to stop them, war can be avoided. In his speech on domestic policy, Togliatti pointed out that the Christian Democratic Party and Catholic Action are currently the two major enemies of Italian democracy. Togliatti insisted: "All our goals will be achieved through legal means, but if our enemies want to use force, we are prepared to use the enemies' methods to deal with them."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. According to TASS, Rome, December 30th: Italian Socialist Party leader Nenni recently delivered a speech here, denouncing the aggressive policies of American imperialism, saying: The purpose of the Marshall Plan is to make the European economy subservient to American imperialism. As a result, the United States has intervened in the Mediterranean, supporting the Franco dictatorship in Spain and supporting the Greek fascist government, which are the mortal enemies of democracy. Nenni pointed out the Italian Socialist Party's foreign policy, stating: We firmly oppose the American attempt to establish a Western European bloc. Italy's economic interests require smooth trade with Eastern European countries. We must not allow foreign countries to control Italy's economic life and hinder the social reforms that have been implemented. Nenni stressed: But the current Italian government is unable to guarantee Italy's independence. It is neither able to oppose the greed of industrialists nor willing to resist the growing pressure from reactionaries, who are trying to turn Italy into a second Greece or Spain. Therefore, opposing the current government is a prerequisite for the struggle for peace.

　　意共举行六代大会
  　托格里亚蒂痛骂美侵略
    【新华社陕北八日电】综合米兰讯：意共第六次全国代表大会于五日在米兰隆重揭幕。到有代表二百二十五万意共党员的八百名代表，各国兄弟党亦纷纷派遣代表团列席。意共领袖托格里亚蒂曾在会上“作长达六小时而毫无倦容”的演说中，痛斥美国帝国主义及梵蒂冈企图奴役意国的政策。托氏指出：“美国已将意大利作成其反苏阴谋的滩头阵地，为此目的，它对罗马政府施行压力，并在罗马政府中找到了横行霸道的帮凶。”托氏指出：加斯贝利政府为美帝国主义所操纵利用，这一政府不久将把意大利出卖给美国，因而意大利有被奴役和变为外国工具之危险。托氏在指出“意大利的另一大敌即梵蒂冈”以后，即强调：意大利劳动人民及共产党坚决反对成立欧洲集团，主张与一切国家，特别是与东欧诸国建立友好邦交及商业关系，以避免使意国成为任何国家掌中之物。托氏继痛斥美国帝国主义及梵蒂冈是世界上最大的战争贩子。他指出战争的危险是美国扩张及独霸世界的纲领之结果，并有梵蒂冈为其帮凶。但托氏满怀信心地说：今天全世界的民主力量比好战派的力量强大，只要爱好和平各民族不怕恫吓，奋起制止，战争即能避免。托氏在其国内政策一部分演说中，指出基督教民主党及天主教行动党，是目前意大利民主的两大敌人，托氏坚称：“我们的一切目的，将以合法的办法达成，但是，假如我们的敌人要用武力，我们就准备采用敌人的办法来对付它。”
    【新华社陕北六日电】据塔斯社罗马十二月三十日讯：意社会党领袖南尼，顷在此间发表演说，痛斥美帝国主义的侵略政策称：马歇尔计划的目的，在于使欧洲经济听命于美帝国主义。结果所至，美国已插手干涉地中海，它们支持西班牙佛朗哥独裁，扶植希腊法西斯政府，这些都是民主的死敌。南尼指出意社会党的外交政策称：我们坚决反对美国建立西欧集团的企图，意国的经济利益需要与东欧各国畅通贸易，必须不让外国控制意大利的经济生活及阻碍已实行的社会改革。南尼力称：但意大利现政府无力保障意国独立，它既无力反对工业家的贪求，又不愿反抗反动派增长着的压力，而这些反动派却力图沦意大利为希腊或西班牙第二。因此，反对现政府乃是为和平而斗争的先决条件。
