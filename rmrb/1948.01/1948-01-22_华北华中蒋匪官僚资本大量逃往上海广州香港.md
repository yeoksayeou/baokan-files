　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Under the large-scale offensive of the People's Liberation Army, large amounts of Chiang Kai-shek's bureaucratic capital funds from North and Central China are fleeing to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong and other places. According to magazines in the Chiang-controlled areas: around the time the People's Liberation Army liberated Shijiazhuang in mid-November, eight to nine trillion Chiang coins of Chiang Kai-shek's funds from North China fled to Shanghai. During the same period, twenty billion Hong Kong dollars of Chiang Kai-shek's gold from Central China fled to Hong Kong, which, according to the Central Bank's Hong Kong exchange rate at the time, was equivalent to more than 29 trillion Chiang coins. Large amounts of funds, foreign currency, and cash were transported directly by planes, trains, and ships because it was inconvenient to remit them. On a train on the Yuehan Railway, cash amounting to 30 billion yuan being transported from Hankou to Guangzhou was discovered in a single instance.

　　华北华中蒋匪官僚资本大量逃往上海广州香港
    【新华社陕北二十日电】在人民解放军大攻势下，华北、华中蒋匪官僚资本资金大量逃往上海、广州、香港等地。据蒋区杂志载：十一月中旬解放军解放石家庄前后，华北蒋匪资金逃到上海的就有蒋币八、九万亿元。同时期内华中蒋匪黄金逃到香港的有二十亿港币，依当时中央银行港汇牌价计算，约合蒋币二十九万余亿元。大批资金、外币与现钞因不便汇兑而直接利用飞机、火车和轮船逃运。在粤汉路火车内一次就发现从汉口运往广州的现钞达三百亿元。
