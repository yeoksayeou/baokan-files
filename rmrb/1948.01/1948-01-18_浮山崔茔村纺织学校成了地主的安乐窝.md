　　【Taiyue News】The Cuiying Village Textile School in the Fourth District of Fushan became a haven for the objects of landlord struggle and has recently been dissolved. This textile school was established in February of the 34th year of the Republic (1945). Among the seventeen people inside, only four were hired poor peasant women, three were middle peasants, and ten were daughters and daughters-in-law of landlords. The landlord Li Kuide's family alone had four daughters and daughters-in-law. This "school" hired two teachers, one was the special agent Bai Shengcang, and the other was Shan Yingjie, the daughter of a large landlord (because she was a teacher, she was also given 9 mu of fruit land and two cave dwellings; the 9 mu of land yielded more than 6 shi of grain last year). This "school" used 3 shi and 4 dou of fruit wheat, more than 8 jin of cotton, and more than 3 jin of thread from the masses. It occupied 6 cave dwellings and 23 mu of land (including more than 1 mu of vegetable garden and irrigated land, and more than 20 mu of wheat land, which yielded 6 shi and 2 dou of wheat last summer). In two years and eight months, only one and a half women in this "school" learned to pull the loom, and the accounts were always in the red. The teacher Bai Shengcang had illicit relations with the landlord's daughters and daughters-in-law, Chen Yuexiang and Gao Fengxiang. These two women also became sworn sisters, enticing cadres into corruption. This den of vipers hid in the school, enjoying good food and being lazy, oppressing hired poor women, and living off the labor of hired poor women. For example, hired poor women Zhang Bochun and Weisheng had to cook meals, wash pots, keep watch, and sweep the floor every day, and also spin 4 liang of thread. They were often restrained by these vipers. During the mass movement, these landlord women tried to prevent middle and poor peasant women from participating in the struggle; in production, the spun thread was coarse and the woven cloth was of poor quality, and the income was not enough to cover the expenses. They invested 50,000 yuan of funds in the pig slaughterhouse of the poor peasant Wu Zhenhe, earning a profit of 8,000 yuan a month, and also invested more than 6 shi of wheat in the cooperative to generate profits. In two years and eight months, the masses not only did not benefit, but lost a lot of struggle fruits, raised a group of landlord struggle objects, and continued to oppress and exploit the masses, undermining the work. Some of the middle and poor peasant women inside could not stand their oppression for a long time and slowly escaped, eventually leaving only the landlord struggle objects. Now this "school" has been dissolved.

    　　Why could this "air-raid shelter" exist for more than two years? The leadership should carefully examine it. Dissolving it is not enough; the crimes of these struggle objects should be thoroughly investigated, recorded, and punished in the upcoming land redistribution movement.

　　浮山崔茔村纺织学校成了地主的安乐窝
    【太岳消息】浮山四区崔茔村的纺织学校，成了地主斗争对象的安乐窝，最近把它解散了。这个纺织学校是三十四年二月成立的，里边十七个人，雇贫农妇女只有四个，中农三个，地主的闺女媳妇倒有十个。地主李奎德一家就有闺女媳妇四人。这个“学校”请过两个教员，一个是特务柏生苍，一个是大地主的闺女陕英杰（她因为是教员，还分了果实地九亩，窑二孔，九亩地去年打了六石多粮食）。这个“学校”用去群众的果实麦三石四斗，棉花八斤多，线子三斤多，占用窑洞六孔，地二十三亩（内有菜园水地一亩多，麦地二十多亩，去夏收麦六石二斗）。二年零八个月，这个“学校”中，只有一个半妇女学会拉梭机，每次算帐都是赔钱。教员柏生苍与地主的闺女媳妇陈月香、高凤香胡搞，这两个妇女又结拜为干姊妹，引诱干部腐化。这一窠毒虫藏在学校里，好吃懒做，欺压雇贫妇女，靠雇贫妇女劳动过活。如雇贫妇女张伯春、卫生每天做饭洗锅，看门扫地，还得纺四两线。常常受这些毒虫们的克制。在群众运动时，这些地主妇女想法阻止中贫农妇女参加斗争；在生产上纺的线粗，织的布不好，收入不够开支。她们把资金五万元投入贫农吴振河的杀猪坊，一月收利八千元，又把麦子六石多投入合作社生利。两年零八个月群众不但没有得了利，反而赔了许多斗争果实，养了一群地主斗争对象，继续欺压剥削群众，破坏工作。里边的一些中农雇贫妇女日子长了，受不了她们的压制，慢慢的逃出来，最后完全留下地主斗争对象。现在已经把这个“学校”解散了。
    　　
    这个“防空洞”为什么能存在两年多？领导上应该好好检查。只解散是不够的，应该把这些斗争对象的罪过查清楚，记下来，在就要到来的平分土地运动中惩办他们。
