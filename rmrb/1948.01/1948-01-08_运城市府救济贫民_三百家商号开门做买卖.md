[Report from the Jinan Front, January 5th] Since the liberation of Yuncheng, our democratic city government has been stepping up various recovery efforts. Starting from December 28th, the Public Security Bureau and citizens jointly investigated and identified more than 1,500 criminals and targets of struggle who were attached to the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandits. The investigation is still ongoing, and they are preparing to hand them over to the People's Court for trial. On the 31st, the Trade Bureau convened a meeting of merchants, explaining our currency policy to everyone. On the first day, the entrance of the Jinnan Bank was crowded with people exchanging currency, converting more than 20 million yuan of Chiang Kai-shek currency (50 yuan Chiang bills exchanged for 1 yuan Jinnan bills). More than 300 businesses have reopened. On January 3rd, the democratic city government opened its granaries to provide relief to the poor, taking out 350 shi of grain and distributing it to impoverished citizens, who were very grateful. They said: The government is their "savior." The city government also established a worker's hostel, taking in more than 200 unemployed railway workers, automobile workers, electric company workers, and flour mill workers. The water company, with the help of the city government, has been restored. The reactionary regimes of the Chiang-Yan bandit gang, such as "governing villages" and "occupying villages," have been completely crushed. Three street offices have been established, and each street office has work teams that go among the masses to publicize current events and land reform. On the 3rd, a citizens' meeting was held with more than 20,000 people participating. Mayor Liu Shaobai explained the various policies of the democratic government to the masses, and Political Commissar Li reported the Communist Party's governing principles. The entire crowd fully supported it, passing the word around: "This gives us a way to survive!"

    【本报晋南前线五日电】运城解放以后，咱们的民主市政府就加紧各种恢复工作。从十二月二十八日起，公安局和市民于联合清查出罪犯和依附蒋阎匪的斗争对象一千五百多人。现在还在清查，准备交人民法庭审问。三十一日，贸易局召集商人开会，向大家说明我们的币制政策。第一日冀南银行的门前就挤满了兑换票子的人，共兑换回蒋币二千多万元（五十元蒋票兑一元冀南票），三百多家商号，都开门做买卖了。一月三日，民主市政府开仓济贫，拿出三百五十石粮食，分给贫苦市民吃，他们十分感激。他们说：政府是“再生恩人”。市政府又设立了一个工人招待所，把好多时候失业了的铁路工人，汽车工人，电灯公司工人，面粉公司工人一共二百多人收留起来。自来水公司在市政府的帮助下，已经恢复起来，蒋阎匪帮的“治村”、“据村”等反动政权已完全打垮，成立了三个街公所，各街公所有工作队到群众中宣传时事和土地改革。三日举行市民大会，有两万多人参加，市长刘少白给群众讲民主政府的各种政策，李政委报告共产党的施政主张，全场群众十分拥护，互相传说：“这可有咱们的活路了”。
