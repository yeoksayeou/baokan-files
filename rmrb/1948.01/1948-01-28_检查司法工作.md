　　Inspect Judicial Work
    The Wu'an Detention Center had been striving to explore the class line, and its work had thus been improved to some extent. However, upon inspection, serious problems still exist; a large number of innocent people are still being detained. This is not just a problem of Wu'an County alone. The problems in those detention centers that still have undesirable work styles are worth exploring. Of course, this is not just a problem of detention center work, but mainly a problem of judicial work, because the detention center is directly led by the judicial section and receives the criminals handed over by the judicial section.
    It must be pointed out that judicial work in various places is not all bad. Most of the staff are working hard to serve the people, but they inevitably have unconscious areas, which lead to results that are contrary to their wishes in their work.
    Therefore, we request that all counties in the region conduct a judicial work inspection without exception. Check the class composition of the self-rehabilitated people, check the facts of the self-rehabilitated people's defendants from the class perspective, and from this check our position and viewpoint in handling cases. See if there are any phenomena of wronged masses in the judicial work of the democratic government, and dig out the problems to seek a thorough solution in coordination with the land redistribution movement.
    Based on the experience of Wu'an, the most basic link in the class line of the detention center is to handle mass cases from a class perspective and not to wrong a single member of the masses. When we accept a mass case, especially when sending a member of the masses to a detention center, we must review it with a very serious attitude and never easily deprive a member of the masses of their freedom. Otherwise, we will commit a crime.
    Therefore, the problem of the class line in the detention center cannot be solved from minor details. For example, if the people's position is lost and innocent people are locked up in the detention center, even if class distinctions are made and the lives of the masses are improved in the detention center, etc., although it is much better than doing nothing, it cannot solve the most basic problem. Because this is only a management issue for the self-rehabilitated people. Only after the class line in handling cases is resolved can the class line of managing self-rehabilitated people be raised to the main position of the detention center's work.
    Here, a point of view should be criticized, that is, "self-rehabilitated people manage themselves" without class distinctions. Under the support of this view, some detention centers once appointed local bullies as life squad leaders because they treated all self-rehabilitated people equally. Therefore, in some detention centers, landlords and bullies who were self-rehabilitated people were very arrogant and even attempted to organize prison breaks. For these heinous guys, we must represent the masses and strictly manage them, and not let them manage themselves.
    Finally, I hope that the results of the judicial work inspection in various places will be sent to this newspaper for publication.

### 检查司法工作

　　检查司法工作
    武安看守所，曾是努力摸索着走阶级路线的，因而工作得到一些改进。可是现在检查起来，还存在着严重的毛病，大量的无罪的群众还被羁押着。这不仅仅是武安一个县的问题，那些在实际工作中依然还有不良作风的看守所，其中的问题，是很值得发掘的。当然，这绝不仅仅是看守所工作的问题，而主要的是司法工作的问题，因为看守所是归司法科直接领导，接受司法科送交的案犯的。
    必须指出，各地司法工作不全然是坏的，大多数的工作人员，都是在努力为人民服务的，但也不免有不自觉的地方，以致在工作中弄得事与愿违。
    因此，我们要求全区各县，无例外的把司法工作检查一下，从自新人的阶级成份上检查，从阶级上检查自新人的被告事实，并从此检查我们处理案件的立场观点。看看在民主政府的司法工作中，有没有冤枉了群众的现象，把问题发掘出来，配合平分土地运动、求得彻底解决。
    根据武安的经验来看，看守所的阶级路线，最基本的一环是从阶级性上处理群众案件，不冤枉一个群众。当我们接受一个群众案件，特别要把一个群众送进看守所的时候，必须以十分严萧的态度，加以审查，绝不许轻易的剥夺一个群众的自由。否则，我们就会犯罪。
    所以，不能从枝枝叶叶上来解决看守所的阶级路线问题。比方，丧失了人民的立场，把无罪的群众关到看守所里，这样，即使在看守所里搞划阶级，改善群众的生活等等，虽然比不作要好得多，但它不能解决最基本的问题。因为这仅仅是自新人的管理问题。只有在解决了处理案件时的阶级路线以后，管理自新人的阶级路线才有可能提到看守所工作的主要地位。
    这里应该批判一个观点，就是没有阶级性的“自新人自己管理自己”。在这种观点支持下，有的看守所，曾叫恶霸当生活大队长，因为凡是自新人，他们都一律同等看待。因此，有的看守所里，地主恶霸自新人，就十分狂妄，甚至企图组织越狱。对于这些罪大恶极的家伙，我们必须代表群众，严格的管理他们，而不能让他们自己管理自己。
    最后，希望各地检查司法工作的结果，寄给本报发表。
