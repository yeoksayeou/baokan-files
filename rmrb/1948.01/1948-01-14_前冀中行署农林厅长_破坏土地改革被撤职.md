Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Electric Dispatch: Zhang Sheng-san, the former Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Hebei-Central Hebei Administrative Office, a landlord element who infiltrated the Party, stole important positions, and consistently resisted land reform and sabotaged the peasant movement, has now been removed from his post by the Administrative Office. The Hebei-Central Hebei District Party Committee has also decided to suspend his Party membership. Zhang is from Wangnou Village, Ding County. In 1944, when Hebei-Central Hebei implemented a major rent reduction, Zhang, in order to evade rent reduction and protect his land, privately organized so-called "production mutual aid," which was actually a "mutual aid group" to evade rent reduction. The mutual aid group stipulated that profits should be divided with 40% going to land and capital, and only 60% to labor. He contributed the land and capital, thereby exploiting the peasants in a disguised form. In the winter of 1945, when the peasants of Xihu Village, Ding County, launched a struggle against black land, Zhang expressed extreme dissatisfaction, slandering the peasant movement as "disrupting social order" and "undermining the united front," and saying that the peasants' struggle was "excessive," attempting to obstruct the peasants' struggle against black land under the guise of the people's name. Zhang also returned to the village under the pretext of "inspecting work," "reorganizing" the Wangnou Village branch, and appointing his subordinates from his "mutual aid group" as the branch secretary, which the masses called the "Zhang Sheng-san branch." Last winter, when Hebei-Central Hebei was carrying out land reform, Zhang proposed focusing all efforts on production, thereby diverting the masses' strength. This summer, when Hebei-Central Hebei conducted a review, the district's Production Committee discussed and decided to combine production with the review, but when Zhang drafted production instructions, he did not mention the word "review." At a cadre meeting, he instead said, "The review hinders production." After the review began, the Party called on Party member cadres from landlord backgrounds to play an exemplary role and take the lead in handing over their land and property to the peasants, but Zhang took his mother to live in the Administrative Office to avoid the mass struggle, and also used the influence of his younger brother to send armed men back home to move things.

　　前冀中行署农林厅长
  　破坏土地改革被撤职
    【新华社晋察冀电】前冀中行署农林厅长地主分子张省三混入党内，窃居要职，一贯抵抗土地改革破坏农民运动，现已由行署撤职，冀中区党委并决定停止其党籍。张系定县王耨村人，民国三十三年冀中实行大减租，张为逃避减租和保护土地，私自组织所谓“生产互助”，实际乃是逃避减租“互助组”。互助组规定分红办法，是土地和资本分百分之四十，劳力只分百分之六十，他是出土地和资本的，变相剥削农民。民国三十四年冬天，定县西湖村农民掀起反黑地斗争时，张极表不满，诬蔑农运为“破坏社会秩序”，“破坏统一战线”，并说农民的斗争“过火了”，冒充人民名义，企图阻拦农民反黑地斗争。张又回村以“检查工作名义，把王耨村支部加以“改造”，并将其“互助组”里的手下人当支部书记，群众则称为“张省三支部”。去冬冀中正进行土改时，而张却提出全力搞生产，借此分散群众力量。今夏冀中进行复查，该区生产委员会讨论决定生产与复查结合进行，但张在起草生产指示时，却不提复查二字，在干部会上反说：“复查妨害了生产”。复查开始后，党号召地主出身党员干部起模范作用，首将自己的土地财产拿出来交给农民，但张却把他母亲接到行署去住，躲避群众斗争，还借其弟之势力，派武装回家搬运东西。
