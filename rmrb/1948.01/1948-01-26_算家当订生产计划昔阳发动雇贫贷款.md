　　[Xiyang News] After a recent inspection of winter loans in this county, it was proven that some villages used correct methods to directly lend to the poor and employed, which played a significant role. However, some village cadres arbitrarily distributed the loans, and the difficulties of the poor and employed were not resolved. When Dingyu Village in the Seventh District issued winter loans, they first held a symposium for the poor and employed, discussing past hardships, calculating family assets, understanding the disaster, and formulating winter production plans. For example, the poor and employed Wang Lianhe (an old man) is a good household. The family of three cultivated 7.7 mu of sloping land, harvested three dan of grain last year, and ate an average of 4.5 dou (small dou) of coarse and fine grains per month. They paid 50 jin of burden grain and spent 4 small dou of rice to buy two houses. Now, they only have 2 shi of miscellaneous grains left, which they plan to eat for five months (from November to the end of March). In addition, they planted one mu of wheat, which is estimated to yield one small shi, enough to supplement two and a half months of food, leaving a shortage of one and a half months until the end of July. Based on this calculation, they formulated a production plan: carrying charcoal to Zanhuang, each trip can carry 110 jin, earning 30 yuan per jin, totaling 3,300 yuan. Buying grain on the return trip, they can carry 6 dou, earning 3,600 yuan. The round trip will earn a total of 6,900 yuan. After deducting expenses of 1,600 yuan for the four-day round trip, the net profit is 5,300 yuan. However, they had difficulty with the initial capital, so they borrowed 20,000 yuan. They plan to carry charcoal and sell grain in the winter and the first month of the new year, and with the money earned, in addition to supplementing food, they guarantee to buy a donkey. Also, the poor and employed Gao Sanyin and Yao Wenhua jointly borrowed 30,000 yuan. They rely on the mountains for a living and jointly collect crow plums, having already collected 20 jin, which can be sold for 200 yuan per jin. They also chop cypress branches, planning to chop 30,000 jin in three months, which can produce 300 jin of cypress oil, selling for 500 yuan per jin, totaling 150,000 yuan. After calculation, everyone formulated a production plan. All 400,000 yuan of loans in the village were lent to the poor and employed in a timely manner. Now, they have already bought three donkeys. The 400,000 yuan loan in Nanying Village was also lent to the poor and employed in this way, with plans to increase livestock by 13 heads, of which seven have already been purchased. The second type is the wrong method. Village cadres in Nanyetou Village, regardless of the needs of the masses, used the loans to buy four donkeys and distributed them to the masses, but no one dared to take them. To this day, the livestock are still idle, and the difficulties of the poor and employed have not been resolved. The 230,000 yuan loan in Shangguozhuang Village was distributed to 12 households, and the cadres assigned specific people to manage production, with the lending households and cadres splitting the profits at a two-eight ratio; if money was lost, the lending households were not responsible. The lending households are not satisfied with this method, nor has it met the requirements of the lending households. (Zhao Jinren, Qiao Jianqin)

　　算家当订生产计划昔阳发动雇贫贷款
    【昔阳消息】本县冬季贷款，经过最近检查，证明有的村子用了正确方法，直接贷给了贫雇，起了很大作用。有的却叫村干胡乱支派，贫雇困难没有得到解决。七区丁峪村发放冬季贷款的时候，先开了贫雇座谈会，谈时光算家当，认识灾荒，订出冬季生产计划。象贫雇王连和（老汉）是个好受家。全家三口人，共种坪坡地七亩七分，去年打粮食三大石，每月平均吃粗细粮四斗五升（小斗），出负担米五十斤，买下两间房，用米四小斗，现在只剩下杂粮两石，计划吃五个月（从十一月到三月底）。另外种麦一亩，估量能收一小石，能补两个半月的食用，赶到七月底还缺一个半月的食用。这样一算，就订出生产计划：往赞皇担炭，每回能担一百一十斤，每斤赚三十元，共赚三千三百元。回来贩回粮食，能担六斗，赚三千六百元。来回共赚洋六千九百元。往返四天，除去盘费一千六百元，净赚五千三百元。但是本钱困难，就贷了二万元。计划一冬天和正月担炭贩粮，赚下钱除补缺食外，保证还要买驴一头。又有贫雇高三银和姚文化，伙贷款三万元，靠山吃山，伙打乌枚子，已经打下二十斤，每斤能卖二百元。并捎砍柏圪塔，计划三个月能砍三万斤，能出柏油三百斤，每斤卖五百元，共能卖十五万元。经过计算，大家都订出生产计划。全村四十万贷款，就随时贷到贫雇手里。现在他们已经买下毛驴三头。南营村贷款四十万元，也是这样贷到了贫雇手里，计划增加牲口十三头，现已买下七头。第二种是错误的方法。象南冶头村干部，不管群众要求，把贷款买下四头毛驴，给群众往下贷，群众没人敢要，至今牲口还在那里闲着，贫雇群众的困难，没得到解决。上郭庄村的贷款二十三万元，分给十二户，干部指定专人给生产，赚下红利让贷户和他二八分红，赔了钱贷户不管。这样贷款户不满意，也没有满足了贷户的要求。（赵近仁、乔俭勤）
