【Taiyue News】Tunliu peasants are preparing for spring plowing. Many villages have launched a mutual aid movement to buy livestock, especially to help poor and hired peasants solve their livestock difficulties. Sun Xiuhai of Guocun Village in the First District united 16 middle-peasant households, lent 3.2 million yuan, and helped 6 poor and hired peasant households buy 6 head of livestock. The Changjin Village transportation team helped 8 poor and hired peasant families buy 8 head of livestock. Fourteen middle-peasant households in Donghe Village helped three poor peasant families buy three head of livestock. Dongzhihe Village helped eight poor peasant families buy eight head of livestock. Shanghan Village helped six families buy six head of livestock. Dongxingwang, Miaoqiao, Qiquan and other villages also helped poor and hired peasants buy 23 head of livestock. In this movement, the middle peasants also came to understand that helping poor and hired peasants buy livestock reduces everyone's labor, so they are very willing to help. Poor and hired peasants repay the middle peasants' money in installments, paying back a little as they earn a little. Gathering firewood and accumulating manure is done quite well in many villages.

　　屯留中农帮助贫雇买牲口是否变相损害中农利益
    【太岳消息】屯留农民正在准备春耕。许多村庄展开了互助买牲口运动，特别帮助贫雇农解决牲口困难。一区郭村孙秀孩团结十六家中农，借出三十二万元，帮助六户贫雇农买到牲口六头。长金村运输队帮助八家贫雇农买到八头牲口。东贺村十四家中农帮助三家贫雇农买到三头牲口。东至何村帮助八家贫雇农买到八头牲口。上韩村帮助六家买到六头牲口。东兴旺、苗桥、七泉等村也帮助贫雇农买了二十三头牲口。在这个运动中，中农也想通了，知道帮助贫雇农买牲口，是把大家的劳力都减轻了，所以都很愿意帮助。贫雇农借中农的钱是整借零还，赚一点还一点。打柴积粪，不少村子都做的不坏。
