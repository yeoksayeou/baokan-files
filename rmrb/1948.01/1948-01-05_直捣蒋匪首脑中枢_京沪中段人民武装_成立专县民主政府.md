The People's Armed Forces of Chongming Island, across the river from Shanghai, ambushed two Chiang bandit officials guilty of heinous crimes this month, dragged them out of a truck and executed them, and explained in detail to the other passengers in the truck that the unit's purpose was to fight for the liberation of the people. The People's Armed Forces on the border of Wujin (Changzhou) and Jiangyin in the central section of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway established the Chengxi County Democratic Government, a commissioner's office, and several district and township governments. On November 2nd, the People's Armed Forces of that unit engaged in a fierce battle with Chiang bandit local militia in Hengbei Township, Wujin, for one hour, before taking the initiative to leave after dark.
