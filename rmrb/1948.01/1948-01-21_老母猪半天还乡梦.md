Old Sow's Half-Day Homecoming Dream

This is a dramatically revealing account of feudalism from Rugao County, Suzhong. It has been adapted into a play. Rural theatrical troupes tour and perform it throughout the county, and it is known as a "play within a play." It profoundly educates the audience to recognize how insidious and vicious the feudal forces' plot for restoration is, and how vigilance should be heightened to deal with the feudal corpses and wandering souls.

Old Sow (nickname), whose real name was Wu Qikang, was a notorious feudal tyrant in Donghengjia Daiti in that county. Because he only had one line-like eye, people also called him "Snake-eye Third Master." During the re-examination, he was determined to seek refuge with his relative, Wang Xueshan, the Kuomintang bandit self-defense captain, to carry out a homecoming restoration.

On October 29th, he ran all night, and at dawn, he reached the Tiger Village along the Ru (Gao) Xin (Shenggang) highway. He asked the militiaman on night watch, "What place is this?" When he heard the reply "It's Tiger Village," he dejectedly muttered to himself, "No good, I've been wandering all night, and I've ended up in a New Fourth Army nest!" The militiamen vigilantly approached and comforted him, "Master, it doesn't matter, we are the Clearing-the-Countryside Team." One of them pointed to a person wearing a yellow jacket and said, "He is our deputy of the Township Team." Old Sow hesitated for a while and then believed them. He sat down on the ground and began to curse, "The bandits are so bad, all my family's things have been divided up, I was just about to go to Xueshan, you have to help me get revenge!" The militiamen heard this and determined that he was a reactionary landlord trying to defect to the enemy. They further inquired about his name and address, politely invited him to eat, and at the same time told him that Captain Wang (referring to Wang Xueshan) had set off to clear the countryside to the west today. At this time, another militiaman hurried to Donghengjia Daiti to tell the instructor and Village Chief Wang about the whole situation. Donghengjia Daiti was immediately disguised as a Kuomintang bandit "Encirclement and Suppression Headquarters" and the whole village was placed under martial law.

Before long, four young men dressed as township team members ran to Old Sow breathlessly and reported, "Master! Captain Wang and Platoon Leader Lu are sweeping Donghengjia Daiti and Jiulongkou today. The bandit army's township instructor, village chief, and the common people have not escaped. Captain Wang specially ordered us to take you back to be the Bao head." After hearing this, Old Sow tucked his dry tobacco pipe and took two steps at a time to run towards his home, cursing as he ran, "Damn it, when I get my way, we'll see who struggles against whom!" Upon entering the village, he saw things piled up in front of the village chief's door, and he said harshly, "If anyone loses even a little bit of my stuff, see how they get away with it!" Running further, he saw his piglets crawling out of the grass, and he gritted his teeth and said, "Whoever touches a single pig hair of mine, I will have their life!" Walking into the "headquarters," a tall man stood up with a smile to greet him, "Old Wang is here, do you recognize me!" Old Sow said, "Sir, I don't recognize you." The fake Clearing-the-Countryside team member immediately introduced him, "That's Platoon Leader Lu, also the Head of the Township." The two then ordered, "Now that Old Wang is here, bring the prisoners up for trial!" At this time, the news spread throughout the village, and more than two hundred people excitedly gathered to "watch the play." They all stood outside the door in silence, exchanging glances.

The first to be brought up was the village chief and the instructor. To make sure that the crowd outside the door could hear more clearly, Platoon Leader Lu said to Old Sow, "My ears have been deafened by artillery fire, you have to speak louder for me to hear." Old Sow repeatedly agreed. When he saw the bound instructor, he said fiercely, "He is the instructor, his people are extremely fierce, and he also has a box cannon (actually, he doesn't)." Platoon Leader Lu instructed the soldiers to take him (referring to the instructor) into the room and give him a beating! Old Sow was very pleased, "So you recognize me now, will you divide the land and distribute things again!" When they were pretending to beat two female comrades in the room, Old Sow heard that the sound was not right. He asked from outside, "This is not the sound of hitting flesh!" Platoon Leader Lu pretended to be angry and scolded the executing soldiers a few times, and then really hit a few times. Old Sow nodded when he heard this and said, "That's right!" He completely believed it.

Platoon Leader Lu then asked who else in the village were bad people. Old Sow jumped in and said, "There are many, many, the militiamen, women, and Grandma Ma Si are the worst." He immediately grabbed Grandma Ma Si, made her kneel down, and said with an insulting and self-satisfied air, "You divided my two pieces of clothing and wore them, twisting your hips on the road. Now, you can lead the women to ask me for foreign money!" When Platoon Leader Lu asked how to deal with these "vicious people," Old Sow said with a murderous aura, "The instructor and Grandma Ma Si should be killed with knives, the township chief and village chief should be spared a whole corpse and buried alive; the remaining dozen or so militiamen should be given a little bit of suffering before being shot!" The crowd outside the door were all sticking out their tongues.

Talking about the village's security issues, Platoon Leader Lu asked Old Sow to be the Bao head. He said, "I am too old and illiterate, why not let my eldest son be the deputy Bao head and my nephew be the Bao head." Platoon Leader Lu expressed his respect for his opinion. Then he turned around to flatter Lu, saying, "You National Army troops have worked hard, we should also collect some donations and get a few fat pigs to reward you."

Old Sow, having gained power, immediately convened a village meeting to prepare for formal executions and to reward the "National Army." At this time, Platoon Leader Lu suddenly removed his disguise and said to Old Sow, "Take a closer look, who am I? I am not the Kuomintang bandit's Platoon Leader Lu, I am the one sent by the Democratic District Government..." This shock was extraordinary, scaring Old Sow until his eyes stared straight ahead. The militiamen rushed forward and tied him up. Grandma Ma Si pointed at him and cursed, "You are so vicious. You acted as a fake homecoming corps for half a day and acted so powerful. If you really defected to the Kuomintang bandits, wouldn't you want to wipe out the entire village?" An uproar of beatings resounded from the angry crowd, and some shouted loudly, "The frog wants life and the snake wants to run away, leaving him will be the end of us!"

　　老母猪半天还乡梦
    这是苏中如皋县一个富有戏剧性的暴露封建面目的纪事。已编为剧本。为农村剧团轮回在全县各地演出，有“戏中戏”之称。它深刻地教育了观众认识封建势力的复辟阴谋是如何的狠毒险恶，应该如何提高警惕，来对付封建僵尸和游魂。
    老母猪（绰号）原名吴启康，是该县东横家埭一个封建大恶霸。由于他只有一条线样的独眼，人们又称他“蛇眼三爷”。复查中，他一心想投靠到亲戚蒋匪自卫中队长王学山那里去进行还乡复辟。
    十月廿九日，他跑了一夜，天刚亮，摸到靠如（皋）新（生港）公路的老虎庄，碰到看夜的民兵，他问：“这是什么地方？”当听到回答“是老虎庄”时，他丧气地自语：“不好，摸了一夜，又摸到新四军窝里来了！”民兵们机警地走近去安慰他：“老爷，不碍事，我们是清乡队。”一面指着一个穿黄袄子的说：“他就是我们的乡队附。”老母猪犹豫了一会，就相信了。往地下一坐就骂了起来：“土匪多坏呀，我家的东西都被分光了，我正想上学山那里去，你们要帮我报仇呀！”民兵们一听断定是反动地主想投敌，并进而请教他的姓名和住址，客气地招待他吃饭，同时告诉他王队长（指王学山）今天出发向西清乡去了。这时另一个民兵忙跑到东横家埭，将全部情形告诉了指导员和王村长，东横家埭便立即被化装成一个蒋匪的“清剿营部”全庄戒严。
    不一会，四个扮装乡队员的青年，气喘喘地跑去向老母猪报告：“老爷！王队长卢区队附今天扫荡东横家埭九龙口，匪军的乡指导员、村长、老百姓一个也没有跑掉。王队长特叫我们来接你老人家回去当保长”。老母猪听罢，旱烟杆一夹，就三步作两步的跟着来人向家奔，一面跑来一面骂：“入妈妈的，我得了势，看是谁斗争谁呀！”一进庄，看见村长门口摆满了东西，他手一横说：“那个少掉了我一点东西，看他怎么过关！”再跑跑看见他的猪子从草里钻出来时，他咬牙切齿地说：“谁动了我一根猪毛，我要他偿命！”走进“营部”，一个高个子起身笑脸相迎：“老王来了，你可认识我！”老母猪说：“先生我不认识。”假清乡队员马上介绍说：“卢区队附那是绞乡长。”二人便命令说：“既然老王来了，把犯人带上来审吧！”这时消息传遍了全庄，二百余群众兴奋地集合起来“看排戏去”，他们都一声不响地互相丢着眼色站在门外。
    第一个被带上的是村长和指导员。为使门外群众听得更清楚一些卢区队附对老母猪说：“我的耳朵被炮击震聋了，你说话要高点才听得见。”老母猪连连称是，他一见被绑的指导员，就狠声地说：“他就是指导员，他门人顶凶，他还有支盒子枪（其实是没有）。”卢区队附吩咐士兵把他（指指导员）关到房内去，给他一顿毒打！”老母猪很得意：“你今朝认得我啦，你会分田分东西啦！”当在房内正假装打两个女同志时，老母猪听出响声不对，他在外面发问：“这不是打在肉上的声音呀！”卢区队附故作怒容，把执刑的士兵骂了几句，里面真的打了几下。老母猪一听点点头说：“这倒不错！”便深信不疑了。
    卢区队附再问庄上还有那些坏人，老母猪抢着说：“多徕多徕，民兵妇女还有马四奶奶顶坏。”立即将马四奶奶抓来跪下，老母猪使着侮辱而自鸣得意的神气说：“割分了我两件衣裳还穿在身上扭呀扭的屁股不在路上。今朝你可领着妇女向我要洋钱啦！”当卢区队附问怎样处置这些“狠人”时，老母猪杀气腾腾地说：“指导员、马四奶奶两个要刀杀，乡长村长饶他得个全尸活窑；其余十几个民兵，把点苦给他们吃了再枪毙！”门外的群众听了，个个舌头直伸。
    谈到村里治安问题，卢区队附叫老母猪当保长，他说：“我年纪太大了，又不识字，不如叫我大儿子做副保长，叫我侄儿做正保长。”卢区队附表示尊重他的意见。于是他又转过来拍卢的马屁，他说：“你们国军都辛苦了，我们也要收点捐弄几只肥猪来慰劳你们。”
    老母猪得了势立即召开村民大会准备正式开刀并慰劳“国军”。此时卢区队附骤然卸了伪装对老母猪说：“你再仔细看看，我是谁？我不是蒋匪的什么卢区队附，我是民主区政府里派来的………”这一惊非同小可，把老母猪吓得眼睛直瞪，民兵一拥而上将他绑起，马四奶奶指着他骂道：“你好毒呀，你当了半天假还乡团，就这样威风，要是你真的投靠了蒋匪，全庄的人你还不都想灭掉？”愤怒的人群里响起一阵打声，有的则大声说：“田鸡要命蛇要跑，留下他还有我们！”
