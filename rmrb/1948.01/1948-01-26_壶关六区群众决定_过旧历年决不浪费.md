　　Masses in the Sixth District of Huguan Decide:
  　No Waste During the Old Lunar New Year
    [Huguan News] In Shuzhang, Qiaoshang, and other villages in the sixth district of Huguan, some people are preparing for the New Year by putting down production and planning to have a good feast. Some middle peasants have misunderstood the Land Law and are also thinking of taking advantage of the New Year to eat and drink extravagantly. Most of the women have stopped spinning and are doing needlework, sewing shoes and socks, in preparation for the New Year. Out of a total of 198 women who spin in Shuzhang Village, an actual check revealed that 77 were spinning cotton, 63 were making shoes and socks, and most of the remaining 58, except for a few who had children or were sick, were also doing miscellaneous things for the New Year. Of the 27 constantly working looms in the village, seven have now been idled. The situation is similar in Qiaoshang Village, where women are sewing socks and making shoes, preparing to grind corn flour and steam steamed buns for the New Year. It seems that spinning is about to collapse. The two small-scale cooperatives in Shuzhang are preparing to buy flour and distribute it to the masses for the New Year. Gui Fu said, "I invested 80,000 yuan in this small cooperative to buy some flour and distribute it to the masses to solve the New Year's difficulties." Zhao Jinshui said, "We've turned ourselves around. Others are eating meat. Even if we have to create a famine, we have to buy a dozen or so pounds of flour to celebrate the New Year." Some people have misconceptions about the Land Law and also want to waste. Prosperous middle peasant Qin Song said, "Flour costs 320 yuan per pound. We'll sell some hemp and buy some flour for the New Year." Middle peasant Nie Yongfu from Shatan said, "We have to take advantage of the New Year to eat a few good meals quickly. During the New Year, no one pays much attention. After the New Year, who knows if it's up to us." Based on these situations, first, we thoroughly publicized the principle of equally distributing land, relying on hired and poor peasants, and uniting with middle peasants, so that middle peasants who have misconceptions about the Land Law correctly understand that hired and poor peasants and middle peasants are one family and will not harm the interests of middle peasants. We also raised the question: Do we want to celebrate the New Year by working hard in production to welcome the New Year, or do we want to stop production and wait for the New Year? Is it better to waste during the New Year or to save? Finally, we also proposed to break old customs, not to waste, and to visit fewer relatives. Niu Shuan from Shuzhang said, "My family alone has nine relatives. If we steam steamed buns to visit relatives, my family would have to use at least three dou. It's much easier not to visit, saving effort to spin more cotton, which is much better." Li Hong then said, "The New Year is easy to get through, but the days are hard to get through. If we eat everything during the New Year, we won't have the energy to farm. If we save grain during the New Year and eat it while planting, we'll have extra energy." The old mother of military dependent Wang Nianjiu was worried that she wouldn't have anything good for the New Year. Finally, her son, Gen Gen, solved the problem for her, saying, "During the famine year, we weren't even full on cornmeal on the first day of the New Year. Didn't we still celebrate the New Year? This year is also a famine year, and we can't go into debt to celebrate the New Year again." Women like Ge Lou said, "It's good not to steam steamed buns, saving us from grinding the mill. It also frees up time to spin more." After everyone discussed, the problem was solved ideologically. Everyone not only resumed spinning but also worked harder. Shuzhang launched a half-month (from the eighth to the twenty-third of the lunar month, ending on the twenty-third, after which everyone started preparing for the New Year) intensive spinning campaign, setting a fifteen-day intensive plan. All 198 spinning women in the village were to spin 829 jin of cotton in fifteen days. The whole village did not steam steamed buns, saving an average of two dou per household, totaling 79 shi of grain for 298 households. Women in Qiaoshang Village also spun an additional 260 jin, saving more than two dou of grain per household for the New Year, totaling 49 shi of grain for 215 households in the village. Finally, everyone discussed that they should still improve their lives in the New Year, but they cannot go into debt because of the New Year. As Gui Fu and others said, "If we have flour, we'll eat flour. If we don't have flour, we'll eat elm bark. Glutinous rice and rice and flour pancakes are also fine." Each sub-district is conducting challenges, inspecting each other, and carrying out a heated intensive spinning campaign to ensure that the fruits of winter production are not wasted.

　　壶关六区群众决定
  　过旧历年决不浪费
    【壶关消息】壶关六区树掌、桥上等村，有些人准备过年，放下生产，想着好好的吃一下。有些中农对土地法认识错了，也想乘过年大吃大喝。妇女们大部分停止了纺织，做针工、缝鞋袜，准备过年。树掌村纺织妇女共一百九十八人，实际检查了一下，有七十七人在纺花，六十三人做鞋袜，五十八人除少数生了小孩或有病外，大部也在做过年的杂事情。村里常动的二十七架织布机，目下已有七架休息起来。桥上村也是如此，妇女都在缝袜做鞋，准备推玉茭粉子，蒸馍馍过大年。眼看纺织就要垮台。树掌两个小型合作社准备买来面，分给群众过年吃用。贵富说：“我这个小型社投了八万元，买上些面，分给群众，解决过年困难。”赵金水说：“咱翻了身，人家吃肉哩，咱就弄上个饥荒也得买上十几斤面，过过年”。有些人对土地法有错觉，也想要浪费。富裕中农秦松说：“面成了三百廿元一斤，卖上些麻，也得买些面过个年”。沙滩中农聂永富说：“得趁住过年机会，赶快吃上几顿哩。过年时吃一吃，大家不很注意，过了年还不知由咱不由咱”。根据这些情况，首先把平分土地，依靠雇贫团结中农的原则深入宣传，让对土地法有错觉的中农，正确认识雇贫中农是一家，不会损伤中农利益。又提出年是要过，但是努力生产迎接新年呢？还是停止生产等待过年呢？过年是浪费好哩？还是节约好哩？最后又提出要打破老规矩，不能浪费，少走亲戚。树掌牛拴说：“我一家就有九家亲戚，要是蒸馍馍走亲戚，我家至少也得老斗三斗。不走多省事哩，省下工夫多纺上些花，不比甚强？”李红则说：“年好过日月难过，过个好年吃完了，没劲种地；要是过年省下粮食，吃上种地，分外有劲。”军属王年九的老母亲，发愁过年没有些好东西，最后她的儿子根根给她解决了问题，他说：“灾荒那年，初一玉茭面还没吃饱，咱没过年？今年又是灾荒，咱也不能再登上窟窿去过年。”妇女圪楼等说：“不蒸馍馍可好，省得咱推碾子。又能替出时间多纺织”。经过大家讨论，从思想上解决了问题。大家不但把纺织工作恢复起来，而且更加努力了。树掌开展了白天黑夜半个月（自初八到二十三日结束，二十三以后大家开始做过年生活）的突击纺织运动，订出半个月的突击计划，全村纺织妇女一百九十八人，在十五天内要纺织八百二十九斤。全村不蒸馍馍，每户平均省二斗，二百九十八户共节约粮食七十九石。桥上村妇女也多纺织二百六十斤，每户过年也节省二斗多粮食，全村二百一十五户，共省粮四十九石。最后大家讨论，新年还要改善改善生活，不过不能因过年登下饥荒。如贵富等说：“有面吃面，没面就是榆皮＠＠，糯米闷饭，米面油饼也行。”各小区进行挑战，互相检查，开展着热烈的突击纺织运动，保证不把一冬生产果实浪费了。（六区通讯组、得三、复明、永福、良玉）
