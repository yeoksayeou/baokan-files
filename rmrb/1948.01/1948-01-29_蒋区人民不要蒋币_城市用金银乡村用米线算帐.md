Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Reports from various sources indicate that the malignant inflation and deepening military crisis of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have caused the Chiang currency to lose credibility, and the people in the Chiang-controlled areas have gradually and universally refused to use it. In Shanghai, the heart of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit area, gold bars are used for transactions such as buying machines and taking over houses. Large loans are calculated in US dollars and gold. Even rent collection refuses to use Chiang currency and is based on US dollar value. In Guangzhou, the ruling center of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in South China, all transactions are valued in Hong Kong dollars. A reporter from a Nanjing news agency bought several pieces of clothing in Guangzhou. After the purchase, because he did not have enough money on him, he returned to the hotel to get the money. The round trip took only ten minutes, but because the Hong Kong dollar had risen, he had to add more money to take delivery. In general trading places, telephone inquiries are constantly made about the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate in order to adjust transaction prices. In Jiujiang, a port on the Yangtze River, all major transactions are calculated in silver dollars. At the beginning of last month, each silver dollar was exchanged for more than 100,000 Chiang currency, and it is still rising. In the rural areas of southern Jiangsu, barter has replaced Chiang currency. The most common is the use of rice, and in yarn-producing areas, yarn is used. All borrowing, business, and payments are calculated in yarn or rice. Chiang currency is only used for small payments or when both parties agree. In one county town, even buying furniture is based on the price of yarn. For example, a wooden cabinet costs ten bundles of yarn, and a bed costs fifteen bundles of yarn. Buying a conscript (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' so-called "volunteer soldier") costs about one piece (forty bundles) of yarn or more. Larger gambling and usury are also calculated in yarn, with a monthly interest rate of three bundles per piece of yarn lent. A Shanghai economic magazine pointed out that in the final stage of inflation, this rural barrier against the intrusion of Chiang currency will inevitably become more widely popular throughout the Chiang-controlled areas.

### 蒋区人民不要蒋币　城市用金银乡村用米线算帐

　　蒋区人民不要蒋币
  　城市用金银乡村用米线算帐
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据各方报导：蒋匪的恶性通货膨胀与其军事危机的加深，已使蒋币丧失信用，蒋区人民已逐渐普遍拒用蒋币。蒋匪心脏区域上海，买机器、顶房子等等，都用金条交易，大额借款用美钞黄金计算，甚至收房租亦拒用蒋币而以美钞论值。蒋匪华南统治中心广州，一切交易均以香港钞票计值。南京某通讯社记者在广州购衣料数件、购定后因身上款项不足，返旅店取款，来回不过十分钟，因港钞已涨，即需另行加价，否则即不能取货。一般交易场所，均不断以电话探询港钞汇率，以调整交易价格。长江口岸九江，一切较大交易均以银洋计算。上月初旬，每元银洋已兑蒋币十万余元，现仍在上涨中。江南农村实物通货已代替蒋币。最普通的是用稻米，产纱区则用纱。一切借贷、经营、支付都以纱或米计算，只在零星支付或双方同意时才用蒋币。有一个县城，连买家具都以纱为折价。例如一个木橱十捆纱，一张床十五捆纱。买壮丁（即蒋匪所谓“志愿兵”）一个，大约要一件（四十捆）多纱。较大赌博、放利亦用纱计算，放纱一件月利三捆。沪某经济杂志指出：在通货膨胀末期，这种农村阻遏蒋币侵入的壁垒，必将更为广泛的普及蒋区各地。
