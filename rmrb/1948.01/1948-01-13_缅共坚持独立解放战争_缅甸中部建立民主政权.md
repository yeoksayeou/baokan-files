Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 11th: Rangoon dispatch: The Burmese Communist Party has recently established a democratic regime in the areas of Taungoo, Pyinmana, and Yamethin in central Burma (the above three places are all important cities along the railway line between Rangoon and Mandalay), and is persisting in the Burmese people's independent liberation war. The current Burmese cabinet held a secret meeting and dispatched a large number of armed forces to carry out "encirclement and suppression," vainly attempting to eliminate the Burmese democratic movement according to the intentions of British imperialism, in order to consolidate the rule of the British and Burmese reactionary classes. According to the so-called "Independence Treaty" formally signed by the current Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu and British Prime Minister Attlee on November 17th of last year, Burma "seceded" from British rule and became "independent" on the 4th of this month. The cabinet is composed of reactionary leaders of the "Freedom League" (that is, the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League during the Anti-Japanese War) (Thakin Nu is the vice-chairman of the Freedom League), and the constitution is formulated by the Constituent Assembly controlled by the reactionary class. Since the Burmese landlords and comprador-bureaucrat capitalists threw themselves into the arms of their British masters and colluded with British imperialism to suppress the Burmese revolutionary movement, they have aroused a new wave of the Burmese people's struggle for independence and democracy.

　　缅共坚持独立解放战争
  　缅甸中部建立民主政权
    【新华社陕北十一日电】仰光讯：缅甸共产党已于最近在缅甸中部之倘哥、平蛮及雅默生（上述三地均在仰光与曼德勒之间，为铁道沿线之重要城市）等地区成立民主政权，坚持缅甸人民的独立解放战争。缅甸现内阁曾举行秘密会议，并出动大批武装进行“清剿”，妄想按照英帝国主义的意图，消灭缅甸的民主运动，以巩固英国及缅甸反动阶级的统治。按去年十一月十七日缅甸现内阁总理达钦努与英首相艾德礼正式签定所谓“独立条约”，规定本月四日缅甸“脱离”英国统治而“独立”，内阁以“自由同盟”（即抗日时期的反法西斯人民自由同盟）的反动领袖（达钦努即为自由同盟副主席）组成，由掌握在反动阶级手中的制宪会议制定宪法。自从缅甸大地主、买办官僚资本家投入英国主子怀抱，并勾结英帝国主义镇压缅甸革命运动后，便激起缅甸人民争取独立民主斗争的新浪潮。
