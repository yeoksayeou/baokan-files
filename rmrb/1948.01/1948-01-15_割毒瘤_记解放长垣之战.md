　　Cutting Out the Tumor
    ——A Record of the Liberation of Changyuan
    ·Cui Dianchen·    
　　　　I.
    Changyuan County, east of the Pinghan Railway, was a remaining stronghold in northern Henan, a tumor growing on the people. More than two thousand Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops of the Ji Bao 12th Regiment and local miscellaneous bandits were trapped there. The city was known as Nine Li Thirteen Steps, with all four gates surrounded by walls (three layers of gates). The city walls were two zhang high and about one zhang seven thick, capable of garrisoning a battalion. Every fifty to sixty meters, there was a protruding bunker with three layers of gun holes and tunnels extending directly outside the city. Outside the bunkers, two outer trenches were built around the city, each one zhang six or seven wide and deep, with two wooden walls made of tree trunks and willow branches. Inside the city, large and small碉堡 (diǎobǎo) pillboxes were scattered everywhere. The area outside the city was flat and sparsely populated. Relying on this so-called "impregnable" city wall, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits attempted to resist the people. But they still knew that no fortifications could stop the People's Liberation Army. So they started new busywork, forcing tens of thousands of people around the city every day, filled with trepidation, to rush to build new defensive works.
    　　　　II.
    The masses were waiting day and night for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army to cut off this tumor for them.
    On December 18th, the People's Liberation Army advanced to Mazhuang and Zaoke, north of Changyuan City. It was just after the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' bestial trampling. The pots and bowls of the villagers were smashed, doors and windows were burned, livestock and clothing were looted, and the corpses of the murdered masses lay bleeding by the roadside. On the snow-covered Hebei-Shandong-Henan Plain, people who had been made homeless by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits staggered along, their cries merging into one. When they saw their own soldiers arrive, they knew the day of revenge had come.
    On the morning of the 19th, the 1st Battalion held a combat mobilization meeting. The affected masses, supporting the old and carrying the young, rushed into the meeting place shouting slogans such as "Support the People's Liberation Army in attacking Changyuan and avenging us!" The wife of the militia captain, with disheveled hair, holding her child, wept uncontrollably. She walked up to the soldiers, and choking with sobs, said: "My man...the militia captain...was killed by the enemy this morning..." With a groan, she fainted on the ground. The masses rushed to call out: Wake up! Don't cry! Tell us! Tell our troops! They will surely avenge us!
    "Leaving my four family members behind, how...how...are we going to live!" Another woman cried and fell to the ground. One accusation after another followed. The whole place was silent. From the ranks of soldiers came a roar of hatred: We must avenge the people! We will resolutely take Changyuan City!
    Before the departure, the masses sent many iron shovels for the soldiers to use for fortifications. On the handles of the shovels were pasted bright red strips of paper, on which were written the words "Take Changyuan," what great encouragement!
    The troops set out fully armed. The cheering masses waved two red flags, beat gongs and drums, and shouted slogans such as "Take Changyuan! Get back our things! Bring back our livestock!" Many people even competed to carry large pots and carry luggage for the soldiers. The soldiers declined with the slogan "Resolutely avenge the masses."
    　　　　III.
    At 3:00 PM on the 21st, the general offensive began. More than a hundred artillery pieces of various calibers, including榴弹炮 (liúdànpào) howitzers, field guns, and mountain guns, which the Chiang bandits gave us, along with hundreds of light and heavy machine guns, bombarded the north gate of Changyuan into a sea of fire. The city walls collapsed, bricks and stones flew everywhere, and dust shot straight into the sky. The assault soldiers lying on the ground were all deafened and dizzy. A gap of two or three meters opened in the city wall. The soldiers, carrying ladders, rushed towards the city wall through the smoke and dust. The stubbornly resisting Chiang bandits desperately blocked the gap. Two charges were beaten back by bombs: the company commander and the political instructor were both wounded. At this time, the second platoon leader, Comrade Qin Shaoyi, a hero in killing the enemy, volunteered to act as the company commander. After reorganizing the team, he said to the deputy political instructor: I will definitely complete the assault mission. Then, he led the team to charge. Deputy Battalion Commander Comrade Liu Shaopu immediately shouted: "We must strive to be the first to climb the city!" While shouting, he rushed out. While crossing the first row of chevaux de frise, Comrades Qin and Liu fell one after another. The instructor reorganized the team for the third time and said: "Comrades! We must carry forward the tenacity of the Guitun battle! Respond to the demands of the Changyuan masses, and not lose face for the people!" While the troops were advancing, the instructor was wounded in the waist. Company Commander Li Lin continued to lead the troops straight to the city wall. Squad Leader Wang ShouKui led his squad of six men and quickly crossed the second row of chevaux de frise. The enemy's bombs did not stop their advance. At this time, the gap in the city wall had been expanded more than ten times larger than the first time by our artillery fire. They quickly and nimbly climbed up along the collapsed city wall. At this time, there were fifty or sixty enemies in the protruding part east of the gap, still firing fiercely downwards. Comrade Wang ShouKui shot down the first one. Another turned around to run, but was immediately shot down by Wang ShouKui. By this time, the troops had rushed to the base of the city wall. Seeing that things were not going well, the enemies ran away with their tails between their legs. The troops rushed into the city.
    　　　　IV.
    Zhu Ziwen, the mutual aid team leader of the 2nd Company, 3rd Platoon, was liberated from the Tangyin battle. As soon as the troops rushed into Changyuan Street, he saw the enemy running into a courtyard. He threw bombs while shouting: "The People's Liberation Army gives preferential treatment to prisoners, those who lay down their arms will not be killed!" Then he jumped over the courtyard wall, which was more than a zhang high. The enemy was in chaos, shouting, "It's over! Let's surrender! Let's surrender!" He heard this, quickly stepped forward and shouted loudly: "Don't move! Those who lay down their arms will not be killed! The People's Liberation Army gives preferential treatment to prisoners!"
    "Are you the political instructor?" the enemy asked tremblingly.
    "I am!" he said calmly.
    Twelve enemies obediently put twelve rifles on the ground, raising their hands as prisoners.
    Another part of our army rushed to the Catholic Church where the Ji Bao 12th Regiment was stationed, but the enemy had already fled. The soldiers opened the ammunition depot, and炮弹 (pàodàn) artillery shells, bullets and rifles were piled up in half a room, capturing a total of more than 110,000 rounds of ammunition, more than 100 rifles, more than 130 artillery shells, and many other supplies.

　　割毒瘤
    ——记解放长垣之战
    ·崔殿宸·    
　　　　一、
    平汉路东的长垣县城，是豫北一个残留据点，是长在人民身上的一个毒瘤，蒋匪冀保十二团及地方杂顽两千多人就困守在那里。此城号称九里十三步，四门皆围城（三道门），城高二丈、厚约丈七，上可屯兵一营，每隔五六十米有一突出堡垒，上有三层枪眼，下有坑道直越城外。地堡之外，环城又筑两道外壕，宽深各丈六七，并用树干柳棍扎成两道木城，市内大小碉堡星罗棋布，城外平坦无际，村落稀疏，盘据蒋匪便依仗这座所谓“铜墙铁壁”的城垣，企图对人民进行顽抗。但他们仍是知道：任何工事堡垒是不能阻挡人民解放军的。于是他们又开始了新的忙碌，每天强迫着城周数万人民，胆战心惊的赶筑新的防御工事了。
    　　　　二、
    群众日夜期待着解放军的来临，为他们割掉这个毒瘤。
    十二月十八日，人民解放军挺进长垣城北的马庄、枣科，正是蒋匪兽蹄蹂躏之后，全村群众的锅碗为之粉碎，门窗为之烧毁，牲口、衣物为之抢光，被杀群众，血迹淋淋的陈尸道旁，风雪交加的冀鲁豫平原上蹒跚着被蒋匪害得无家可归的人们，哭声叫声融成一片。当他们看到自己的子弟兵到来的时候，他们想到复仇的日子已经到来。
    十九日上午，一营召开战斗动员大会。被难群众扶老携幼，高呼着：“拥护解放军打长垣，为我们报仇”的口号涌进了会场。民兵队长的女人，披头散发抱着小孩哭不成声。她走到战士们面前，哽哽咽咽的说：“我男人………民兵队长……今早被敌人打……打……打死了”。哼的一声晕倒在地，群众们争相呼唤：醒吧！不要哭了。诉吧！向咱们的队伍诉吧！一定能给咱们报仇的！
    “留下我娘儿们四口，怎……怎……么过呀！”又一个女人哭着倒地了，控诉一个接一个的下去。全场沉寂了，士兵行列里喊出了仇恨的吼声：我们要为老百姓报仇！坚决打下长垣城！
    出发前群众送来许多铁锹，供战士们作工事。铁锹把子上贴着鲜红的纸条，上边写着：“打下长垣”四字，这是多么大的鼓舞啊！
    部队整装出发了，欢送群众打着两面红旗、敲着锣鼓，喊着：“打下长垣！认回我们的东西！拉回我们的牲口”的口号，许多群众并争着抬送大锅，替战士背行李，战士们以“坚决为群众复仇”的口号谢绝了。
    　　　　三、
    二十一日下午三时，总攻开始了。蒋贼送给我们的榴弹炮、野炮、山炮及各种口径的百余门炮火下配合着数百挺轻重机枪，把长垣北门轰击成一片火海，城墙坍塌砖石四飞，尘土直冲云宵，伏在地面的突击战士都震得耳聋头晕了。城墙塌开了两三米的缺口，战士们抬着云梯冒着尘烟直扑城墙，顽抗蒋匪拼命的堵住缺口，两次冲锋都被炸弹打回来：三连长、指导员一齐负伤了，这时二排长杀敌英雄秦绍义同志自报奋勇的代理连长，整顿队伍后，对副指导员说：我一定完成突击任务，说罢，带队即冲。副营长刘绍普同志，当即喊出：“咱们要争取首先登城！”他一边喊一边就跟着冲出去了，在越过第一道鹿柴时，秦刘二同志相继倒下来，教导员又第三次整理好队伍后说：“同志们！我们要发扬贵屯战斗的顽强性！回答长垣群众的要求，不能给人民丢脸！”部队前进中，教导员又腰部负伤，一连长李林同志继续带领队伍直扑城头。九班长王守魁同志带领全班六个人，迅速越过第二道鹿柴后，敌人的炸弹并没有阻止他们的前进，这时城墙的缺口已被我们的炮火轰击得比第一次扩大了十多倍，他们就迅速沿着坍塌的城墙敏捷的攀登上去。这时，缺口以东的突出部有五六十个敌人，还在向下狂烈射击，王守魁同志一枪就打倒了最先的一个，另一个回头就跑，但立刻又被王守魁打倒了。这时部队已冲到城根，敌人看到已经不行了，夹着尾巴都跑了，部队便冲进到城内了。
    　　　　四、
    二连三班互助组长朱子文是汤阴战役解放过来的。队伍一冲进长垣大街，他发现敌人往一个院子里跑，便一面扔炸弹一面喊：“解放军优待俘虏，缴枪不杀！”随即跳过丈多高的院墙，敌人乱作一团，七嘴八舌的嚷吵着：“不行了！缴枪吧！缴枪吧！”他听到了，便手急眼快的抢上一步，大声喝道：“不准动！缴枪不杀！解放军优待俘虏！”
    “你是指导员吗”？敌人战兢兢的问：
    “我就是！”他不慌不忙的说。
    十二个敌人服服贴贴的把十二支步枪放在地下，高举着双手作了俘虏。
    另一部我军直扑冀保十二团所住的天主堂，但敌人已逃窜了，战士们打开弹药库炮弹子弹步枪堆集了半屋，总共缴获了十一万余发子弹，百多条步枪，百三十余发炮弹，及其他许多物资。
