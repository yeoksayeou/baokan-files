Xinhua News Agency,豫陕鄂 Frontline, 21st: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has created a scoring method in the merit and good deed recording movement, which has now become a mass movement of self-education and self-management. Initially, Guo Xiaofeng of the famous Wang Anguo Model Class researched a "Profit and Loss Chart" for regularly recording merits, recording each comrade's merits daily as a certain number of points, and deducting a certain number of points for errors. Later, after further research by everyone, a more refined "Point Increase and Decrease Chart" was created, and based on past experience, the "Three Records" movement of recording points, recording good deeds, and recording merits was launched. The regulations stipulate that good deeds are recorded as points every day, bad deeds are deducted points, ten points constitute one good deed, three good deeds constitute one minor merit, three minor merits constitute one average merit, three average merits constitute one major merit, and three major merits constitute one special merit. This method not only adapts to the level of activists but also to the level of backward elements, and does not bury anyone's slightest achievement. Even backward elements, accumulating day by day, can become heroes and models. For example, Luo An, a soldier in a certain regiment, had performed very poorly in the past, but since the "Three Records" movement was launched, he gradually corrected his past shortcomings, and his score increased day by day, and he was credited for his performance in the Zhenping battle. At this time, the troops were developing a surge of mass mobilization. Li Xuexiang, deputy platoon leader of a certain unit, marched at night and mobilized the masses during the day. He helped four villages carry out land reform in one day. The political department of the unit issued a special order to record his merit. Fifty percent of the people in Guo Xiaofeng's company participated in mobilizing the masses, and therefore the company was credited. The unit generally reflected that after the implementation of the Three Records, the cadres' leadership became much easier. For example, in the past, soldiers drinking cold water could not be stopped, but later it was proposed that whoever drinks cold water will have points deducted, and since then no one has drunk it. Currently, the political department of the unit has made a decision to universally launch the "Three Records" movement.

　　陈谢某部实行“三记”
  　形成群众性的自我教育运动
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十一日电】解放军某部在记功记好运动中创造了记分办法，现已成为群众性的自我教育、自我管理的运动。起初著名的王安国模范班郭小峰研究出一种经常记载功绩的“赔赚表”，把每一个同志的功绩逐日记成若干分，把错误扣去若干分，后来经过大家进一步的研究，制成了比较精细的“记分增减表”，并参酌以往的经验，开展了记分、记好、记功的“三记”运动。规定每天好的记分，不好的扣分，十分为一好，三好为一小功，三小功为一平功，三平功为一大功，三大功为一特功。这种办法不仅适应积极分子的水平，同时也适应落后分子的水平，埋没不了任何人的一点成绩。即使是落后分子，日积月累，亦可成为英雄模范。例如某团战士罗安过去表现很不好，自开展了“三记”运动后，便逐渐改正了过去的毛病，分数逐日增加，镇平战斗中就记了功。在此时期，部队正展开发动群众的热潮，某部副排长李学详黑夜行军，白天发动群众，曾在一天内帮助四个村庄进行土地改革，该部政治部特传令记功。郭小峰所在连有百分之五十的人数参加发动群众，因而记了功。该部普遍的反映，三记实行后，干部领导省事多了，例如过去战士喝冷水制止不了，后来提出谁喝冷水扣谁的分，此后就没有人喝了。现该部政治部作出决定，普遍开展“三记”运动。
