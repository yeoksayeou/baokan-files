　　[Report from our Jinnan office on the 7th] The land reform in Jize in the past was not thorough, and it was difficult for poor peasants to engage in sideline occupations. In Fancun, eight mutual aid groups organized eleven carts to haul manure, earning a profit of 300,000 yuan in fourteen days, and there were also fifteen small carts engaged in transportation. Most of these people were middle peasants with carts, cattle, and capital. Poor peasants Xu Shuxiang, Fan Tongfang, Zhao Dongsheng, and others all said enviously: "People have cattle, carts, and capital, so they can earn so much. We only have one share of cattle, no capital, and no carts, so we can't do anything." In Zhongshendi Village, there were ten carts hauling coal, fifteen small carts for transportation, and sideline occupations such as steamed bun shops, noodle shops, and tofu shops, most of which were also owned by middle-peasant households. Twenty poor peasant families were unable to engage in sideline occupations and were trapped at home. These facts show that the land reform in the past was not thorough, and the poor peasants had not completely turned themselves around. Therefore, solving the difficulties of poor peasants in engaging in sideline occupations became a major problem. Zhao Yanlin, the director of the Fancun Farmers' Association, actively visited various poor peasant families. When they raised difficulties such as lacking capital, carts, or harnesses, Zhao Yanlin immediately mobilized households with carts to pull together with households without carts, and borrowed money from middle peasant families for poor peasants, having already borrowed 75,000 yuan to give to the poor peasants. He also found harnesses for the poor peasants from neighboring villages. In order to support the poor peasants, the village cadres of Zhongshendi Village proposed selling the remaining fruits, wheat, trees, and copper coins in the village for money, which could be sold for 297,000 yuan, to be temporarily lent to the poor peasants.

　　鸡泽是否有同样情形
    【本报冀南七日电】鸡泽过去土地改革不彻底，贫农搞副业有许多困难。范村有八个互助组组织了十一辆大车拉粪，十四天赚利三十万元，还有十五辆小车搞运输。这些人多半是有车有牛有本钱的中农。贫农徐书香、范同房、赵冬生等都眼红的说：“人家有牛有车有本钱，能赚那么多，咱只有一个牛股，又没本钱又没车，什么也不能干。”中申底村有十辆大车拉煤炭，十五辆小车运输，还有馒头坊、挂面坊、豆腐坊等副业，也多数是中农户。有二十家贫农无法搞副业，在家困着。这些事实说明过去土地改革不彻底，贫农还没翻透身，因此解决贫农搞副业的困难就成了大问题。范村农会主任赵言林积极访问各家贫农，当他们提出没本钱没车套等困难时，赵言林立即动员有车户与没车户伙拉，并往各中农家给贫农借钱，已借了七万五千元交给贫农。他又向邻村给贫农找车套。中申底村村干为扶助贫农，提出将村中果实尾巴麦子、树、铜钱卖成钱，可卖二十九万七千元，暂时贷给贫农。
