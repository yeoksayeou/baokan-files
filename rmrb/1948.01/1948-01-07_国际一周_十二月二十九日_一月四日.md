　　International Week
　　December 29th - January 4th

    1947 has passed, and countries around the world have, as usual, made summaries of the past year. This summary paints two distinctly different pictures: light and darkness, happiness and pain. In the Soviet Union, the 1947 production plan has been basically and successfully completed and exceeded, the rationing of daily necessities has been abolished, and the overall industrial and agricultural production and the people's living standards have fully recovered and, in some parts, exceeded pre-war levels. Currently, the Soviet people are working hard and launching a revolutionary competition to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. In the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe, the economy is booming, and the lives of the working people have greatly improved. For example, in Yugoslavia, industrial production in the first eleven months of the first year of the Five-Year Plan exceeded the plan by 6.6 percent, and crop yields in 1947 increased by 2.4 percent compared with the average yield of the past ten years. In 1947, the average wage of workers and staff increased by 27 percent. More than one million working men and women spent their holidays happily in sanatoriums. But on the other side of the world, the corrupt capitalist world is in a state of "destructive crisis." For example, the United States, which made a fortune in the war, has also experienced inflation, soaring prices, the general impoverishment of the people, and a sharp decline in their purchasing power, resulting in unsalable goods and mountains of inventory. At the end of 1947, goods worth 50 billion US dollars were piled up in warehouses. The number of unemployed is also increasing day by day, and it is estimated that it will reach 6 million to 8 million this year. The American government and the public are extremely shocked and pessimistic under the shadow of this impending economic crisis, and even many bourgeois economists have to lament: "An economic crash will occur this year." The situation in Western Europe is even worse, and it is generally in a serious crisis of insufficient production. The British Labor government is even "hesitating to publish the economic outlook for 1948." In "gloomy France" (as the newspaper "New France" says), the economic crisis is particularly serious. The Schumann reactionary government is trying to shift the burden of this crisis onto the shoulders of the French working people, and has therefore adopted a series of reactionary financial and economic measures, such as the emergency tax law, forcing people to buy 130 billion francs of public debt, and laying off large numbers of workers and staff. But this will not only fail to save the French economic crisis, but will also further prompt the starving people to rise up and fight for survival.
    Northwestern Europe, which is in deep crisis, cannot but rely on and seek help from the thriving Eastern Europe. In the past week, in addition to the United Kingdom signing a draft business and loan agreement with the Soviet Union, Sweden, Norway with the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands with Czechoslovakia have successively signed barter agreements, and a Swiss business delegation is also about to go to the Soviet Union to negotiate trade agreements.
    In the past week, the situation in France and Italy has still been seriously concerned by all parties. The reactionary financial and economic measures implemented by the French reactionary authorities to save their economic crisis have aroused strong resistance from the vast number of French people. The French farmers have begun to resolutely rise up to fight. More than 8,000 farmers in Dax County in southwestern France, unafraid of sacrifice and bloodshed, broke through the armed suppression of the police and held a large protest demonstration. "L'Humanité" called on the French people to form an alliance to fight for the protection of their lives. A delegation from the Seine Provincial Chamber of Commerce also visited the Communist Party members of the Economic Committee of the National Assembly, asking them to appeal for a reduction in tax rates and an exemption from emergency taxes. The "National Committee of the Middle Class" lodged a strong protest and warned that it "will take necessary actions to resist all arbitrary decisions." In Italy, the People's Democratic Front, composed of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party and various progressive groups, has been formally announced. This great unity of the Italian people in struggle will be an important symbol of the in-depth development of the Italian people's democratic struggle.

　　国际一周
  　十二月二十九日——一月四日
    一九四七年已经过去了，世界各国照例都作了一番一年来的总结，这个总结描划出了光明与黑暗、幸福与痛苦的两种显然不同的景况。在苏联，基本上已胜利完成并超过了一九四七年的生产计划，取消了日用品配给制，使整个工农业生产与人民生活水平完全恢复了并有一部分超过了战前水平。目前，苏联人民正奋不顾身为四年完成五年计划展开了革命的大竞赛。在东欧新民主主义诸国内，经济蒸蒸日上，劳动人民的生活大为改善。例如在南斯拉夫，五年计划头一年前十一个月的工业生产已超过计划百分之六点六，农作物产量，一九四七年较过去十年的平均产量增加了百分之二点四。一九四七年职工的平均工资增加了百分之二十七。有百余万劳动男女在疗养院中欢度假期。但在世界的另一面腐败的资本主义世界却正处在“毁灭性的危机”中。例如曾在战争中发财致富的美国，亦发生了通货膨胀物价飞涨、人民生活普遍贫困化及其购买力的大大降低，结果使商品卖不出去，存货堆积如山，一九四七年底有价值五百亿美元的货物堆积在货栈里。失业人数也日多，据估计今年将达六百万至八百万。美国朝野在这种迫近的经济危机阴影的笼罩下异常震惊和悲观，甚至许多资产阶级的经济学家，也不得不哀鸣：“今年将发生经济的暴跌。”西欧的情况，则更为恶劣，一般都处在生产不足的严重危机之中。英国工党政府甚至对“发表一九四八年的经济展望，踌躇不决”。在“暗淡的法国”（新法兰西报语），经济危机尤为严重。舒曼反动政府则力图把这一危机的重担转嫁到法国劳苦人民的肩上，因此采取了一连串反动的财政经济措施，如紧急征税法，强迫人民购买一千三百亿法郎的公债，以及解雇大批职工等，但这不仅不能挽救法国的经济危机，而且将更促使饥饿人民奋起为生存而战斗。
    危机深重的西北欧，不能不依赖和仰求于欣欣向荣的东欧。一周来除英国与苏联签订了商务和贷款协定草约外，瑞典、挪威与苏联、荷兰与捷克之间均相继签订了换货协定，瑞士商务代表团亦行将赴苏商订贸易协定了。
    过去一周法意局势仍为各方所严重注意。法国反动当局为了挽救其经济危机所实行的反动的财政经济措施，已激起了法国广大人民强烈的反抗。法国农民已开始坚决地起来斗争了。法国西南部达克斯县的八千余农民不怕牺牲流血，冲破警察的武装弹压举行了抗议大示威。人道报为此号召法国人民组成联盟，为保障生活而斗争。赛纳省商会代表团亦访问国民议会经济委员会共产党议员，要求代其呼吁减低税率和豁免紧急税。“中等阶级全国委员会”提出强硬抗议，并警告“将采取必要行动，以反抗一切专横决定。”在意大利由共、社两党及各进步团体所组成的人民民主阵线已正式宣告成立，意大利人民这种战斗大团结，将是意国人民民主斗争深入展开的重要标帜。
