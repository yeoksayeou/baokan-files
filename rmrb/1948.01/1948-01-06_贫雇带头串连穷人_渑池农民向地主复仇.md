　　Poor and Hired Peasants Lead the Connection of the Poor
　　Mianchi Peasants Avenge Themselves on Landlords
[Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 4th Dispatch] After the liberation of Mianchi County, Western Henan, peasants rose up to denounce and avenge themselves on the landlords and local bullies. After the liberation of Mianchi County, reactionary landlords still wanted to rule the peasants by standing on the heads of the masses. Zhang Bingyi, the head of the reactionary landlord in Dongguan, spread rumors and threatened the masses, saying: "The People's Liberation Army is here, and you are acting recklessly. I, Zhang Bingyi, am famous in Dongguan. Who doesn't know that? The township government can't do without me for every feast. Which of you poor people has ever been to one? The People's Liberation Army is like locusts in the autumn fields; how many times can they jump? The Central Army has been the Central Army for decades." The masses did not believe this. As soon as the movement started, Zhang Bingyi and Li Suqing, this gang of reactionary landlords, were afraid and ran away. After meetings and propaganda, the hired and poor masses knew that the Communist Party was working for the poor, and they slowly began the denunciation and revenge movement. The masses organized themselves to search the mountains and arrest landlords and local bullies. The masses in Nanyu Village investigated the children of the big landlord Zhang Bingyi and went up the mountain with sickles and axes at night to catch them. The villagers in Nanguan captured the father of the landlord Li Shuqing and immediately denounced him. Li Xiaozou and Song Heshang, poor and hired peasants from Zhuobai Village, five miles away from Dongguan, joined the Dongguan Farmers' Association and took the lead in organizing the poor people in their village, automatically distributing the landlords' grain, livestock, and baggage, and asked the working comrades in Dongguan to lead them. They also captured the escaped big local bully Zhang Bingyi and handed him over to the Dongguan peasants. At the rally to struggle against the landlord Zhang Bingyi, the peasant Zhang Qizhi said: "The sky is clear, and I am not afraid of you today, Zhang Bingyi!" Zhang Bingyi's nephew, Zhang Xiaoxue, denounced and beat Zhang Bingyi, saying: "My land has just been plowed and is about to be planted, and you forced me to sell it to you. How did my brother die?! I am not afraid of you today." A few-year-old children also denounced how Zhang Bingyi seized their land and forced them and their elderly grandmothers to beg for food, and they beat him hard. The son of an old woman was killed by Zhang Bingyi. At the rally, she couldn't say a word and just cried loudly, shouting: "Son, my son!" All the peasants in the audience shed tears. Another old woman beat him and said: "Zhang Bingyi, my house burned down, and you were happy to say it should. It is right for me to beat you today."

　　贫雇带头串连穷人
  　渑池农民向地主复仇
    【本报太岳四日电】豫西渑池农民起来，向地主恶霸诉苦复仇。渑池县解放后，反动地主还想站在群众头上统治农民。东关的反动地主头子张秉义造谣威胁群众说：“人民解放军来了，你们胡干，我张秉义在东关是有名的，谁不知道？乡公所哪次请客也离不了我，你们穷人谁去过一次？人民解放军是秋地里的蝗虫，能跳几下？中央军是几十年的中央军了。”群众不信这一套。运动刚开始，张秉义和李肃庆这伙反动地主就害怕跑了。经过开会宣传，雇贫群众知道了共产党是给穷人办事的，慢慢开始了诉苦复仇运动。群众组织起来，自动搜山，捉地主恶霸。南峪村群众调查大地主张秉义的孩子，晚上便拿着镰刀斧头上山去抓。南关抓回地主李书庆的父亲，立刻诉苦。离东关五里地的卓白村贫雇农李小走、宋和尚，参加了东关农会后，带头把本村的穷人组织起来，自动的分了地主的粮食牲口和包袱，要求东关的工作同志领导他们干。还把逃跑了的大恶霸张秉义抓住交给了东关农民。斗争地主张秉义的大会上，农民张其芝说：“天爷可晴啦，张秉义今天我可不怕你了！”张秉义的侄子张小雪又诉又打的向张秉义说：“我的地刚犁过要去种，你就逼着要卖给你，我哥怎么死的？！今天我也不怕你了。”几岁的小孩也诉说了被张秉义霸走土地，逼得和年老的奶奶讨饭，说着便狠狠的打起来。一个老太太的儿子被张秉义害死，大会上她一句话也说不出来，光大声哭，喊着：“儿呀，我的儿呀！”全场农民都流下泪来。另一个老太太一面打，一面说：“张秉义，我的房子火烧了，你高兴的说应该，我今天打你也应该。”
