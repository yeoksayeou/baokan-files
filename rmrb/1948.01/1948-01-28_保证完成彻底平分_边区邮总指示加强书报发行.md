【Postal Administration News】The Border Region Postal Administration recently instructed all bureaus and stations to strengthen newspaper and book distribution in the upcoming land redistribution movement. The instructions pointed out: In distributing Party newspapers, in addition to forwarding subscriptions, attention must be paid to regulating distribution, reflecting distribution conditions and reader opinions to the newspaper offices at any time. The practice of only "subscribing," "collecting money," and "delivering newspapers" should be changed. The task of distributing the People's Daily to the districts must be well guaranteed to eliminate blank areas. All counties in the Taihang District and along the Pinghan-Baijin railway line, where newspapers can reach the post office within three days, should be distributed to the villages according to needs (other districts can also distribute to the villages if needed). The distribution of New Masses must be combined with rural postal services for promotion, combined with farmers' associations, and widely publicized using various methods to develop subscribers. Taihang has launched a campaign to promote 10,000 copies of New Masses, and all districts should make immediate efforts. In order to overcome errors in intermediate transmission and unclear cover rubbing, from February 1st, all bureaus will uniformly implement a "Newspaper Transfer Inspection Form." If there are errors, they can be immediately resealed and sent out according to this comparison, without returning and delaying time. The instructions also called on postal workers to spare time to publicize the Outline Land Law, and to write articles for the newspapers about the people's reactions to the Outline Land Law and the construction of rural postal services. The instructions finally stated: All bureaus, stations, and offices should also pay attention to preventing landlords and rich peasants from using parcel remittances to transfer assets to protect the interests of hired and poor peasants during the land reform period.
