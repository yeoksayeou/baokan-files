Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. According to combined news reports from the Chiang-controlled areas: People's armed forces of varying sizes are densely distributed throughout the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the heartland of Chiang Kai-shek's rule, and have established multiple base areas. The main People's armed forces in Jiangsu are primarily composed of veterans of the New Fourth Army. In 1946, led by Yang Bin, Wu Xian, Li Shunzhi, and others, they began armed resistance against Chiang Kai-shek's persecution. At that time, there was already one detachment and another unit of several hundred people. Later, farmers joined in large numbers, with over a thousand people in Yixing alone. Currently, People's armed forces are active in the Maoshan area, including Jurong, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jintan, Liyang, Jiangyin, Chongming, Fengxian, Chuansha, and other places, as well as the Taihu Pingtaishan area, and have successively established democratic regimes in various locations. After the People's Liberation Army launched a large-scale counter-offensive southward last year, the various People's armed forces became even more active in launching attacks, posing a great threat to Chiang Kai-shek, forcing him to arm the railway lines of Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou). Chiang Kai-shek even issued an order on the 6th of this month to "strengthen the operation against the CCP guerrillas in the Jinghu area." The Chiang Kai-shek Jinghu River Defense Command also held a meeting on the 10th (according to a Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press), which shows the growing prestige of the People's armed forces in Jiangnan.

Zhejiang has five important base areas: (1) The Siming Mountains in eastern Zhejiang, including Ningbo, Cixi, Yuyao, Shangyu, Shengxian, Xinchang, and Chiang Kai-shek's hometown of Fenghua, etc. The main part is the Li Zhiguang unit in this mountain area, with one thousand several hundred people. Now the team is gradually expanding and has established a command headquarters and the Eastern Zhejiang Administrative Office. Another is the Sanbei area, located in the salt-producing area north of Ningbo, Cixi, and Yuyao, with five or six hundred people. The Xu Xiaoyu unit owns more than a hundred small boats, revolving in the land and water areas of Dinghai, Zhenhai, Ninghai, Xiangshan, Nantian and other counties. (2) The Kuaiji Mountains, the Zhou Zhishan unit of more than a thousand people, extending across Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Zhuji and other counties. (3) Southwest of the Kuaiji area is the Ding Guzhi and Wu Shanmin units of the Jin (Hua) Lan (Xi) Basin, with about a thousand people, active in Pujiang, Yiwu, Jiande, Dongyang and other counties. (4) To its southeast are the Kuocang Mountains and Yandang Mountains, including Yongkang, Xianju, Linhai, Huangyan, Wenling, Yueqing, Qingtian, Lishui, Jinyun, Wenzhou, Ruian, Pingyang, Taishun, west along the Fengling Mountains directly to Qingyuan, Longquan, Jiangshan, Changshan, south along the coast to the Fujian border, Fuding, Xiapu and other counties. In 1946, there were already several thousand people led by Cheng Meixing, Huang Longyao, Jin Jinbiao and others under the leadership of the "Fujian-Zhejiang Border Region Headquarters," combined with the local farmers' armed forces "Big Swords Society," taking the area around Fenshuiguan and Qingcao Pass as their base area, developing in all directions. Now the above-mentioned active areas have established the "Zhejiang-Fujian Border Region" base area, and the more prominent leaders among them are Zheng Danfu. (5) The Tianmu Mountain area on the border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. In 1946, there were already over a thousand people from the Wang Shoupeng and Tang Songlin units active. Now, two major guerrilla forces have been established. One part gallops in Anji, Changxing, Wuxing, Deqing, Tongxiang, Lin'an, Yuqian, Changhua and other counties, separated from the Kuaiji Mountains only by the Qiantang River; the other part is the Ning (Guo) Guang (De) (the above two counties are in Anhui) Xiao (Feng) Guerrilla Independent Detachment led by Xu Xiaozhen. The above-mentioned troops are all composed of veterans of the New Fourth Army as their backbone.

The main base area in Anhui is the Huangshan area. In 1946, there were two People's armed forces composed of veterans of the New Fourth Army active: one led by Hu Ming, with over a thousand people and guns, and the other was the Huangshan Detachment led by Feng Lin. After more than a year of development, its military prestige has spread almost throughout southern Anhui. Shexian, Xiuning, Yixian, Qimen, Jixi, Jingde, Ningguo, Xuanzhou, Wuhu along the Jinggan Road, and Taiping, Shitai, Qingyang, Guichi along the Shexian-Tong'anqing Highway, and Jingxian, Nanling, and Fanchang counties between the two roads are all guerrilla areas. In 1947, they successively attacked Jixi and Jingxian.

　　江南人民武装活跃

  　威胁蒋匪心腹区
    【新华社陕北十二日电】综合蒋区报刊消息：蒋匪统治心脏苏浙皖三省密布大小不等之人民武装，并已建立根据地多处。江苏之主要人民武装多以新四军退伍军人为骨干，他们为反抗蒋匪迫害，于一九四六年由杨彬、吴显、李顺之等率领，实行武装抗蒋。当时即有一个支队及另部数百人。以后农民纷纷参加，仅宜兴一地即有千余人。现茅山地区句容、镇江、丹阳、金坛、溧阳、江阴、崇明、奉贤、川沙等地及太湖平台山一带湖面，均有人民武装活动，并已先后在各地建立民主政权。去年人民解放军大举南下反攻之后，各部人民武装更积极出击，予蒋匪极大威胁，迫使其在京沪、沪杭各线武装护路。蒋贼且于本月六日下令“加强对京沪区中共游击队的作战”，蒋匪京沪江防司令部也于十日召开会议（据合众社上海电），足见江南人民武装声威日大。
    浙江重要根据地有五：（一）浙东四明山区，包括宁波、慈溪、余姚、上虞、县、新昌及蒋贼家乡奉化等县，主要一部为该山区李之光部一千数百人，现队伍日渐扩大，已设司令部及浙东行政公署。另为三北区，地处宁波、慈溪、余姚以北的产盐区，有五六百人。徐小玉部则拥小艇百余，回旋于定海、镇海、宁海、象山、南田等县水陆地区。（二）会稽山区周芝山部千余人，纵横于绍兴、萧山、诸暨等县。（三）在会稽地区之西南为金（华）兰（溪）盆地之丁谷之、吴山民等部约千人，活动于浦江、义乌、建德、东阳等县。（四）其东南为括苍山与雁荡山区，包括永康、仙居、临海、黄岩、温岭、乐清、青田、丽水、缙云、温州、瑞安、平阳、泰顺，西沿枫岭山脉直达庆元、龙泉、江山、常山，南傍海岸以迄闽境福鼎、霞浦等县，于四六年即有“闽浙边区总部”领导下之程美兴、黄龙耀、金锦标等率领之数千人，结合当地农民武装“大刀会”以分水关、青草隘一带为根据地，四出发展，现上列活动地区，已建立“浙闽边区”根据地，其中领袖之较著者为郑丹甫。（五）苏浙皖边境天目山区，四六年即有汪寿彭、汤松林部千余人活动，现已建立两大游击部队，一部驰骋于安吉、长兴、吴兴、德清、桐乡、临安、于潜、昌化等县，与会稽山区仅钱塘江一水之隔；另部为许孝珍率领之宁（国）广（德）（上两县在皖境）孝（丰）游击独立支队。上列部队均系以新四军退伍军人为骨干所组成。
    安徽之主要根据地为黄山区，四六年即有新四军退伍军人组成之人民武装两部活动：一为胡明率领，人枪千余，另为冯林领导之黄山支队。经年余发展，军威几遍皖南全境，沿京赣路之歙县、休宁、黟县、祁门、绩溪、旌德、宁国、宣城、芜湖、及歙县通安庆公路沿线之太平、石埭、青阳、贵池与两路之间的泾县、南陵、繁昌等县均为游击区。四七年曾先后攻入绩溪、泾县。
