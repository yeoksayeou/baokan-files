Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 18th: TASS, Moscow: The Soviet newspaper "Labor" strongly condemned the divisive conspiracy of the Frankfurt Resolutions, stating: This is a new manifestation of the imperialistic nature of Anglo-American foreign policy. Dividing Germany is not a new policy of Anglo-American imperialism; this plan was already showing signs during the anti-Hitler war. At that time, the main war aim of the US and Britain was to eliminate German competition in the world market and establish the rule of US and British monopoly capital. The newspaper continued: Now, US monopoly capitalists and their lackeys want to turn western Germany into a semi-colony and use it as a beachhead against the democratic development of Central and Eastern Europe. They dream of dividing Germany, building arsenals in West Germany, and training reactionary German troops, so that they can use the slogan of revenge for their war adventures in the future. The newspaper concluded: The Frankfurt Resolutions are contrary to the interests of peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 18th: Berlin: All progressive forces in Germany have expressed indignation at the Frankfurt Conference, presided over by US and British imperialism, which aims to divide Germany. Walter Ulbricht, Vice Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party, revealed: "The gentlemen of American banks and Konzerns are not satisfied with just ruling the American-occupied zone; they also want to control the British-occupied zone, especially the Ruhr." The Socialist Unity Party of Saxony issued a proclamation to the German people, calling on the people of all occupied zones to smash the plans of the splitters and to make all People's Congresses a powerful pillar of resistance to the division of Germany. The Secretariat of the German People's Congress decided to convene a Standing Committee on the 15th to discuss the urgent task of fighting for German unity and a just peace. The leadership of the Communist Party in the British-occupied zone resolved: "They (referring to the figures participating in the Frankfurt Conference) are attempting to make Germany completely dependent on American monopoly capitalists and turn Germany into a colony based on those plans. The Frankfurt resolution on the establishment of a West German government will continue to worsen our economic situation." The resolution forcefully stated: "The German question should only be decided by the German people themselves. As long as all the people are united, they will certainly be able to thwart the plans of the splitters." The Secretariat of the Communist Party of Bavaria in the American-occupied zone resolved to strongly denounce "the Frankfurt Resolutions as a tool for dividing Germany; they are attempting to establish the rule of large enterprises and landlords in western Germany."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 14th: TASS: The National Federation of Deportees and Detainees from France during the German occupation, as well as anti-fascist resistance fighters and patriots, recently held its third national congress in Lyon. The congress emphasized its attitude of maintaining and opposing fascism. The resolution expressed indignation that French traitors (former Vichy elements and collaborators) were still being pardoned. The congress put forward the following main slogans: Oppose the priority restoration of Germany, eradicate Nazism, severely punish war criminals, eliminate militarism, international co-management of the Ruhr, etc. The congress elected a new national committee, with Curie Lurmanna re-elected as president of the Federation.

　　德国一切进步力量反对“佛兰克福决议”
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联劳动报力斥佛兰克福决议的分裂阴谋称：这是英美外交政策帝国主义性的新表现。分裂德国并非英美帝国主义的新政策，当反希特勒战争尚在进行时，这种计划即露端倪。当时美英主要的战争目的，是消除德国在世界市场上的竞争，并建立美英独占资本的统治。该报继指出：现在，美独占资本家及其从仆，欲将西部德国变为半殖民地，并把它变成反对中东欧民主发展的滩头阵地。他们梦想分裂德国，在西德建立兵工厂并训练德国反动军队，以便将来利用复仇口号来进行其战争冒险。该报结语称：佛兰克福决议是与和平的利益相抵触的。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】柏林讯：德国一切进步力量，对美英帝国主义主持的分裂德国的佛兰克福会议，咸表愤慨。统一社会党副主席关吴里希揭露：美国银行与康采仑的绅士们不满足只统治美占区，他们还想控制英占区尤其是鲁尔。”萨克森州统一社会党为此发表告德国人民书，号召各占区的人民必须粉碎分裂者的计划，并将一切人民代表大会成为抗议德国分裂的有力支柱。德国人民代表大会秘书处决定于十五日召开常置委员会，讨论为德国统一及正义和平而斗争的迫切任务。英占区共产党领导机关决议称：“他们（按指参加佛兰克福会议的人物）企图根据那些计划使德国完全依赖美国垄断资本家。及变德国为殖民地。佛兰克福关于建立西德政府的决议，将使我们的经济地位继续恶化。”决议力称：“德国问题只应由德国人民自己来决定，只要全体人民团结一致，就一定能挫败分裂者的计划”。美占区巴伐利亚共产党书记处决议，力斥“佛兰克福决议为分裂德国的工具，他们企图在德国西部建立大企业及地主的统治”。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据塔斯社十四日电：德国占领期间法国被流放者与被拘留者，以及反法西斯抵抗运动分子与爱国者的全国联合会，最近曾在里昂举行全国第三次代表大会。大会强调指出它对维护和反对法西斯的态度。决议对法奸（前维希分子和通敌分子）仍被宽赦，表示愤慨。代表大会提出下列主要口号：反对优先恢复德国，铲除纳粹，严办战犯，肃清军国主义，鲁尔国际共管等。大会选出新的全国委员会，居里庐曼纳再次当选为联合会主席。
