　　【Benbao Taiyue 5th Dispatch】The Yangcheng Sixth District Cooperative Union's Credit Department, after the county's production meeting, went with district cadres to the villages to inspect their work, revealing serious bureaucratic tendencies and a loss of [political] stance. In the past, they loaned 10,000 yuan to landlord Li Chunyu of Xuequanling, and didn't inquire about it even after six months overdue. When they went to collect the debt this time, the masses had already sealed off Li Chunyu's door. Loans to landlord Zhang Xiaocheng of Baiduo Village and landlord Li Shengqi of Xuegeta were also met with sealed doors from the masses when they went to collect. Last spring, they loaned 200,000 yuan for spring plowing to the masses of Quantou, but none of it reached the peasants; it was used by the village cooperative. The Madi Village Cooperative wrote a letter to the Credit Department introducing a village elementary school teacher for a loan and acting as guarantor. The Credit Department loaned to him without inquiring about his class background or situation. However, when hired and poor peasant Zhang Guosheng wanted to buy an ox and asked for a loan, the cooperative was afraid he couldn't repay it and dared not guarantee it. They carelessly wrote a letter of introduction saying: "Zhang Guosheng wants a loan. If you have funds, lend him some; if not, it's up to you!" In addition, some middle peasants, afraid of being called rich, pretended to be poor and borrowed some money, keeping it at home, and the Credit Department didn't ask about its use before lending it. From these incidents, the Credit Department was unaware of all kinds of inappropriate loans and loans to landlords. After this inspection, they recovered 1,567,300 yuan of loans issued to landlords, rich peasants, cadres, and cooperatives.

　　阳城六区区联社无立场
    贷款发在地主家害怕贫雇还不起
    【本报太岳五日电】阳城六区区联社信用部在县开生产会后，就和区干部下到村里检查一下自己的工作，原来有严重的官僚主义和失掉立场的事情。过去贷给雪泉岭地主李春雨一万元款，过期六个月也不问，这次上门去要，群众早已把李春雨的门封了。贷给柏朵村地主张小成和雪圪塔地主李生奇的款，这次去要，群众也把门封了。去年春天贷给劝头群众春耕款二十万元，但是都没有到了农民手里，叫村里合作社给利用了。麻地村合作社给信用部写了一封信，介绍他村小学教员贷款并作保人。信用部不问成份情况就贷给了。可是雇贫农张郭盛买了牛想贷款，合作社却害怕还不起，不敢担保。马虎的写了封介绍信说：“张郭盛想贷款，有的话贷给他一部，没款你们看吧！”另外有些中农怕人说富，假装穷贷些款，放在家里，信用部也不问用处贷给了。从这些事情看，各种各样的不该贷款和地主贷款，信用部都不知道。这一次检查后，就收回贷给地主富农干部合作社的款一百五十六万七千三百元。
