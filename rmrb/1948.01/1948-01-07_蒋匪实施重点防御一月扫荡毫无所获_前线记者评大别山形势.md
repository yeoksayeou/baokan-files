(Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 5th) Our frontline reporter analyzed the military situation between the enemy and ourselves in the Dabie Mountains over the past month on New Year's Eve, saying: Chiang Kai-shek's troops, feeling that our various counter-offensive armies had penetrated deep into the north bank of the Yangtze River, and that the guerrilla warfare in the south of the Yangtze River was also echoing across the river, creating a situation where they might join forces with our main army to cross the river, severely stinging the heart of the Chiang-controlled areas; and also feeling that the battles in Longhai and Jiaodong had repeatedly suffered defeats, could not but announce that "the key military focus in the future will shift to between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers," and immediately transferred the entire 9th Division, one brigade of the 11th Division, the 20th Division, the 25th Division, and the 28th Division from Longhai and Jiaodong to the Dabie Mountains, and combined them with the original 7th, 10th, 46th, 48th, 52nd, 56th, 58th, 74th, 85th Divisions, and the 202nd and 203rd Divisions of the Youth Army in the Dabie Mountains, totaling 33 brigades, to carry out so-called "sweeping" and "encirclement" operations against our Dabie Mountain area starting on December 1st; that is to say, Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "sweeping" and "encirclement" of the Dabie Mountains occurred under the circumstances of his Yangtze River being shocked, the defeats in Longhai and Jiaodong, and the public announcement and actual retreat from the Yellow River to the Yangtze River, implementing his strategic key defense. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "sweeping" of the Dabie Mountains has been going on for a month now; what has Chiang Kai-shek accomplished in this month? What has he gained? Chiang Kai-shek once followed the mantle of the former commander of the Japanese Army stationed in China, Nobusuke Kishi, who is still in Nanjing today as a guest and top advisor to Chiang Kai-shek, in the "sweeping" of the Eighth Route Army in North China during the War of Resistance, deploying and launching the strength of his 33 brigades. However, due to the weakening of Chiang Kai-shek's forces and the decline of morale, due to the complexity of the terrain in the Dabie Mountains, and especially due to the close connection between the people of the Dabie Mountains and the People's Liberation Army for three months, and the unanimous struggle against the enemy under the land reform movement, the enemy, once entering the Dabie Mountains, was like a blind man groping for fish, and was attacked by the army and people of the Dabie Mountains everywhere. The guerrilla warfare of the common people, combined with the field army, launched anti-"sweeping" and anti-"encirclement" struggles everywhere, killing and wounding Chiang Kai-shek's troops, so that Chiang Kai-shek was either beaten in the front or attacked in the rear. The attacks on Lihuang, Taihu, Yingshan, Susong, Yuexi and other cities by us, and the annihilation of the Youth Army in Guangji City, are all good examples. A captured soldier of the 118th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's 11th Division said: "Coming here is really too hard for us. We walk every day without seeing the common people. We rob the common people of things to eat, but we are still hungry every day. If we are not careful, we will be killed by your militia. Especially, we don't know when we will be annihilated by you, so everyone wants to desert!" This is the best portrayal of Chiang Kai-shek's army. In the past month, Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "sweeping" of the Dabie Mountains has gained nothing. If he has gained anything, it is being exhausted, running around in vain, and losing troops. Chiang Kai-shek also attempted to use the Pinghan Railway as the axis of mobile operations, thinking that this would prevent our army from moving, but this is just a dream. In this month, our army not only quickly deployed our forces to the Tongbai and Jianghan areas west of the Pinghan Road, but also, like autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves, successively captured Tongbai, Zaoyang, Xinye, Qianjiang, Zhongxiang, Tianmen, Jingshan, and Mianyang county towns, annihilating the local Chiang Kai-shek bandits, liberating the people there, and shaking Jianghan; forcing the 85th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army east of the road to rush to the west of the road to deal with it. Recently, due to the great victory of our Su-Lu-Yu-Wan and Yu-Shaan-E field armies in the southern section of the Pinghan Road, and the continued expansion of brilliant results towards Xuchang and Xinyang, annihilating the entire 3rd Division and giving the 20th Division a destructive blow, this is another disastrous defeat in the war situation that Chiang Kai-shek did not expect. Now the Dabie Mountain area has obtained the coordinated actions of our friendly neighboring forces, and in the anti-"sweeping" war, it can expand the results of the war even more. As for crossing the Yangtze River to the south or crossing the Han River to the west in the future, it is even more convenient. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "sweeping" in the Dabie Mountain area for a month has not only gained nothing, but also suffered losses. He has also lost troops and generals west of the Pinghan Road, which makes Chiang Kai-shek even more in a dilemma and unable to laugh or cry in the Dabie Mountains. For the people of the Dabie Mountains: the vivid facts in this Chiang Kai-shek "sweeping" have once again proved to the people that the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army are truly helping the people themselves and establishing patriotic and democratic governments to protect them, while the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and its bandit army are maintaining the rule of landlords, bullies, special agents, and baojia, grabbing grain, conscripting soldiers, oppressing, destroying, and slaughtering the people; only resolutely cooperating with the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army and overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek is the way out. The facts of a month fully prove that the ever-victorious People's Liberation Army and the people of the Dabie Mountains who have awakened and are awakening are not to be trifled with. Chiang Kai-shek should learn a profound lesson from this. General Liu Bocheng said well, he said: "Although the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is anxiously trying to take care of both sides day and night, in the lesson of the line being cut off and the points being surrounded, Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and anti-people war, after its elite has been greatly lost, has been annihilated in a series, and no matter what, both sides cannot be taken care of, and both sides will fail." Of course, we should and will recognize Chiang Kai-shek's activities in the Dabie Mountains. The dying Chiang Kai-shek must make a dying struggle. Therefore, the entire army and people of the Dabie Mountains must further establish a tenacious will on the basis of the victorious confidence of a month of struggle, further strengthen the combination of people's guerrilla warfare and land reform, and the combination with regular operations, and resolutely smash Chiang Kai-shek's dying "sweeping" of the Dabie Mountains.

　　蒋匪实施重点防御一月扫荡毫无所获
    前线记者评大别山形势
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线五日电】前线记者于除夕分析大别山一个月来敌我军事形势说：蒋匪感于我各路反攻大军深入长江北岸，江南游击战争也隔江呼应，大有接应我大军渡江之势，严重的刺痛蒋管区的心脏；同时还感于陇海、胶东的战局接连遭到失败，才不能不宣布所谓“今后军事重点将转移到长江与黄河之间”，并随即将陇海、胶东的整九师一个旅、整十一师、整廿师、整二十五师、整二十八师赶调大别山，并纠合其原在大别山之整七、整十、四十六、四十八、五十二、五十六、五十八、七十四、八十五及青年军之二○二、二○三等师，共计达三十三个旅之众，于十二月一号开始对我大别山区的所谓“扫荡”、“清剿”；这就是说蒋匪对大别山的所谓“扫荡”、“清剿”是在他长江震惊、陇海胶东失败，并公开宣布和实际上从黄河大退，退到长江，实施其战略性的重点防御的状况下出现的。蒋匪对大别山的所谓“扫荡”，直至今天已经进行了一个月了；这一个月中蒋匪有什么作为呢？得到了什么呢？蒋匪曾经依照前日寇驻华派遣军司令，今天仍在南京作蒋匪上宾及最高顾问的战犯冈村宁次在抗战中对华北八路军“扫荡”的衣钵，布署和开展了他三十三个旅的兵力。然而由于蒋匪兵力的削弱和士气的低落，由于大别山地形的复杂，特别是由于大别山人民三个月来已经与人民解放军有着密切的联系，在土地改革运动下一致对敌斗争，使敌人一进到大别山就象瞎子摸鱼，到处遭到大别山军民的打击。老百姓的游击战争与野战军结合起来，到处展开反“扫荡”反“清剿”的斗争，杀伤蒋匪人马，使蒋匪不是前面挨打就是后方受到袭击。立煌、太湖、英山、宿松、岳西等城被我袭击，广济城青年军的被歼灭等都是很好的例子。被俘的蒋匪整十一师一一八旅的士兵说：“到这里来我们实在太苦了，天天走路见不到老百姓，抢老百姓的东西吃还是天天要挨饿，一不小心就被你们的民兵打死，特别是不知道什么时候就会被你们歼灭，所以谁也想开小差！”这就是蒋匪军自己最好的写照。一个月来蒋匪对大别山的所谓“扫荡”并没有得到什么东西，如果得到了的话，那就是疲于奔命，到处扑空和丧师减员。蒋匪也还企图以平汉铁路为机动作战的轴心，认为这就可以阻止我军的活动，但是这只是一个梦想而已。在这一个月中，我军不仅很快的向平汉路西之桐柏、江汉区展开了我军的兵力，而且在那里象秋风扫落叶似的接连打下桐柏、枣阳、新野、潜江、钟祥、天门、京山、沔阳等县城，歼灭那里的土蒋匪，解放那里的人民，威震江汉；使路东之蒋匪军八十五师不得不仓惶调到路西应付。最近更由于我苏鲁豫皖、豫陕鄂各地野战军在平汉路南段破击大胜利后，继续向许昌、信阳间扩张辉煌的战果，歼灭了整三师，并予二十师以歼灭性的打击，这是蒋贼意料所不及的另一方面战局的惨败。现在大别山区获得我友邻部队的协同动作，在反“扫荡”战中就更可以扩张战果，至于今后南渡长江或西渡汉水都更方便了。蒋匪在大别山区一个月的所谓“扫荡”，既是毫无所获，而且遭受损失，在平汉路西又损兵折将，这就更使蒋匪在大别山进退两难啼笑皆非了。对于大别山人民来说：这次蒋匪“扫荡”中活生生的事实又一次给人民证明了共产党解放军是真正帮助人民自身和建立爱国民主政府保护他们的，而蒋介石匪帮及其匪军却是维护地主恶霸特务保甲统治，抢粮抓丁，压迫摧残和屠杀人民的凶手；只有坚决与共产党解放军密切合作，打倒蒋介石才是出路。一个月的事实完全证明常胜的人民解放军和已经觉悟与正在觉悟中的大别山人民是不好惹的，蒋匪应该从这里得到深刻的教训。刘伯承将军说得好，他说：“尽管蒋介石匪帮在领略线线被截断、点点被包围的教训中，日夜苦心焦急，想作到彼此兼顾，但蒋匪卖国的反人民的战争，在其精锐大大丧失之后，又复连串的被歼，无论如何都是彼此都顾不着，彼此都要失败的。”自然我们还应该而且会认识蒋匪对大别山的活动，垂死的蒋匪必然要作垂死的挣扎的。因此大别山全体军民在一个月斗争胜利信心的基础上要更进一步树立起顽强意志，更加强化人民游击战斗与土改的结合及与正规作战的结合，坚决粉碎蒋匪对大别山的垂死“扫荡”。
