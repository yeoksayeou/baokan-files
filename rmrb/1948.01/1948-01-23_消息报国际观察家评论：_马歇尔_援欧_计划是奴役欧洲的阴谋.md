Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Moscow dispatch: An *Izvestia* international observer recently commented: The U.S. government's decision to submit to Congress a mere 15-month "aid to Europe" plan, instead of the previously assumed four-year plan, demonstrates how timely and far-sighted were the warnings of the Soviet Union and European democrats. We said that the Marshall Plan was a plan to enslave Europe, a plan by American monopolists to turn Europe into a tool for conspiracies in the event of a crisis in the United States. This decision once again proves that the American ruling class, in planning their "aid," is only concerned with the interests of American monopolists, and they are striving to force Western European countries to adapt their economies to the economic fluctuations of the United States. The observer continued: American expansionists are also attempting to consolidate their political power in Western Europe. To this end, a large army composed of "special supervisors" will be sent to Western European countries to supervise the "implementation" of the Marshall Plan. These supervisors, numbering about four or five thousand, will include various experts in finance, economics, customs, etc. This large army of supervisors will be subordinate to the military missions composed of U.S. military attachés stationed in the "beneficiary countries," as well as representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (American secret service).

    马歇尔“援欧”计划是奴役欧洲的阴谋
    【新华社陕北二十日电】莫斯科讯：消息报国际观察家顷评论称：美国政府决定，向国会提出只是十五个月的，而不是象前此所假定的四年“援欧”计划。美政府的这一决定，显示了苏联和欧洲民主人士的警告是如何适时而有远见，我们曾说马歇尔计划是奴役欧洲的计划，是美国垄断家在万一美国发生危机时，把欧洲变为一个进行阴谋之工具的计划。这一决定再一次证明了美国统治阶级在计划他们的“援助”时，只是关心美国垄断家的利益，并且他们正努力强迫西欧各国使其经济适应于美国的经济波动。观察家继称：美国扩张主义者亦企图巩固他们在西欧的政治势力。为了这一目的，由“特别监察员”所组成的大军，将要开到西欧各国，以监督马歇尔计划的“实行”。这些监察员约有四、五千人，其中包括财政、经济、关税等各种专家，这一监察员所组成的大军将隶属于美国驻于“受惠国家”之武官所组成的军事使团以及联邦调查局（美国特务机关）的代表。
