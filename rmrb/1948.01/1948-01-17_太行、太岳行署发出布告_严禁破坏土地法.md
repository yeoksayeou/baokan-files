　　Taihang and Taiyue Administrative Offices Issue Public Notice:
　　Strictly Prohibiting the Sabotage of the Land Law
　　[Report from this newspaper] After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law of China and the supplementary measures for the implementation of the Outline Land Law by the border government, the vast number of peasants in the border area, especially the hired and poor peasants, were very happy, sincerely supported it, and prepared to implement it thoroughly immediately. However, many landlords, rich peasants, and all lawbreakers deliberately misinterpreted the Outline Land Law, provoked disunity between hired/poor peasants and middle peasants, transferred, concealed, and dispersed property, and sold and wasted illegally obtained fruits of struggle. These criminal acts of sabotaging the Outline Land Law seriously violated the interests of the peasants. The Taihang Administrative Office has therefore issued a public notice, pointing out: (1) The Outline Land Law is based on the demands of the peasants to thoroughly abolish the feudal and semi-feudal land exploitation system and to satisfy the demands of landless, land-poor, and hired peasants. Landlords and rich peasants must not deliberately misinterpret, provoke, or carry out property transfers and other destructive activities. Those who violate this, once verified by the government, will be severely punished. (2) The land and property of middle peasants, only the surplus land of prosperous middle peasants can be voluntarily extracted through consultation, and their movable property and household property will not be touched. The land and property of other middle peasants will not be touched. Lower-middle peasants can also share the fruits of the struggle. Do not listen to the rumors and provocations of those who struggle against middle peasants. All middle peasants should rise up against such rumors and provocations, concentrate on production and thrift, and maintain close unity with hired and poor peasants. (3) Cadres who occupy too much of the fruits of struggle must return all the excess when the land is equally divided. Before the equal distribution of land, it shall not be transferred, sold, destroyed or wasted. Those who violate this shall, in addition to returning the excess at the time of equal distribution, be punished according to the seriousness of the circumstances. (4) All peasants have the right to file complaints with governments at all levels regarding the above-mentioned illegal acts once discovered, and governments at all levels must investigate and deal with them based on the facts. District and village cadres must not suppress this democratic right of the people. Those who violate this shall be guilty of violating the Outline Land Law.
　　The Taiyue Administrative Office also issued a public notice on the 13th, deciding: (1) During the implementation of the Outline Land Law, all illegal acts such as illegal sales, dispersal, and transfer of land and property are strictly prohibited. (2) No individual, organization, or group may arbitrarily slaughter livestock, cut down trees, or destroy all farm implements, water conservancy projects, and buildings for the purpose of obstructing fair distribution. (3) If any of the above-mentioned illegal acts are found, in addition to confiscating all land and property (to be distributed to landless and land-poor peasants during equal distribution), both buyers and sellers will be sent to the People's Court for severe punishment according to law. (4) All peasants, peasant associations, and poor peasant groups, especially poor and hired peasants, should immediately be vigilant and closely monitor these illegal acts of landlords and rich peasants. If such circumstances occur, they should interfere on the one hand and immediately report to the local county and district governments and peasant associations on the other hand, in order to smash the obstruction and sabotage of these illegal elements. (5) Local governments and peasant associations should accept peasants' accusations and severely punish any illegal elements.

　　太行、太岳行署发出布告
  　严禁破坏土地法
    【本报消息】中国土地法大纲和边府实施土地法大纲补充办法公布后，边区广大农民，特别是雇贫农民十分高兴，衷心拥护，并准备立即彻底实行。但有不少地主富农及一切不法分子故意曲解土地法大纲，挑拨雇贫与中农的团结，转移、隐蔽与分散财产，变卖与浪费非法获得的斗争果实。这些破坏土地法大纲的罪恶行为，严重的违害了农民利益。太行行署特为此发出布告，指出：（一）土地法大纲是根据农民的要求，彻底废除封建性的半封建性的土地剥削制度，满足无地少地雇贫农民的要求。地主富农不得故意曲解、挑拨或进行转移财产及其他破坏活动。违者经政府查之有据，定当严加惩处。（二）中农的土地财产，只富裕中农多余的土地可以协商方式，由其自愿抽出，其浮财及房屋内财一律不动。其他中农的土地财产，一律不动。下中农并可分得斗争果实。不要听信斗争中农的造谣、挑拨，所有中农均应起来反对这种造谣和挑拨的行为，安心生产节约，并保持与雇贫农民的密切团结。（三）干部多占的斗争果实，在平分土地时必须将多占部分全部退出。在未进行平分土地前，不得转移、变卖、破坏或浪费。违者除平分土地时仍须将多占部分照数退出外，并按其情节轻重，给予处罚。（四）对以上各项违法行为，所有农民，一经发现后均有权利向各级政府提出控诉，各级政府定当据实查究。区村干部不得压制这种人民民主权利。违者以违背土地法大纲论罪。
    太岳行署也于十三日发出布告，决定：（一）在实行土地法大纲期间，严格禁止一切违法变卖、分散、转移土地财产等不法行为。（二）不论任何个人机关或团体，不得为着妨碍公平分配之目的而任意宰杀牲口，砍伐树木，及破坏一切农具、水利、建筑等。（三）如有上述违法行为者，一经查出，除土地财产一律没收（平分时分给无地少地农民）外，买卖人员都要送交人民法庭依法严惩。（四）一切农民、农会、贫农团特别是贫农雇农立即警惕起来，严密监视地主富农的这些不法行为，如若发生此种情事，应一面干涉，一面立即向当地县区政府与农会告发，以粉碎这些不法分子的阻碍破坏。（五）各地政府、农会应接受农民的告发，并对任何非法分子予以严惩。
