　　Defeat the Yan Bandit's "Waterlogging" Offensive
　　Yuci Launches Landmine Warfare
　　[Taihang News] In the effort to crush the Yan bandit's "waterlogging" offensive in Yuci, landmine warfare played the greatest role among the militias of the second, third, and fourth districts on the Yuci border. The Yan army's Eighth Column, stationed in Yuci, along with a battalion of the Tenth Column, numbering about a thousand men, launched attacks on our border areas on the 30th and 31st. The border militias of more than ten villages in the fourth, second, and third districts formed a joint defense to resist the enemy. After scouting the enemy's situation in advance, they evacuated the masses from the villages, and the village militias laid landmines on the roads the enemy would pass. When the enemy passed through our pre-laid minefields, the militias fired potshots, scaring the enemy into running around, causing them to be blown up everywhere, and preventing them from looting the villages. In the villages at the forefront, landmines were exploding everywhere. In two days, thirty-two landmines exploded, killing and wounding thirty-six enemies. The female militia of Yangbei Village also laid twenty-six mines, seven of which were triggered by the enemy, wounding seven enemies, scaring the Yan bandits so much that they dared not come out and plunder casually anymore.

　　打垮阎匪“水漫”进攻
  　榆次开展地雷战
    【太行消息】榆次边地二、三、四区的民兵，在粉碎榆次阎匪“水漫”进攻中，地雷战发挥了最大的作用。住榆次的阎军八纵队配合十纵队的一个营共有千把人，在三十号、三十一号连着向我边地进攻时，四、二、三区十多个村的边地民兵，便以联防作战阻击敌人，事先侦探好敌人情况后，把村内的群众转移出来，各村民兵便在敌人经过的道路上埋下地雷，当敌人经过我预先埋好的地雷线时，民兵就打冷枪，吓的敌人乱窜，使敌人到处挨炸，不敢进村乱抢。在最前边的村子，真是村村地雷开花，两天内爆炸的地雷就有三十二个，炸死炸伤敌人三十六名。杨北村的女民兵也埋雷二十六个，敌人踏响七个，炸伤敌人七名，吓得阎匪再也不敢随便出来抢掠了。
