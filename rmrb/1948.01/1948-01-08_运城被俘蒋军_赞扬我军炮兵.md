[This dispatch comes from the Jin-Nan Front] Captured Chiang Kai-shek soldiers in Yuncheng praise our army's artillery:

　　The People's Liberation Army's artillery fire in the attack on Yuncheng was unprecedentedly concentrated and fierce. Captured Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers said upon meeting, "Your artillery fire is truly powerful, one shell can collapse the city tower. When your artillery fires, we can't even raise our heads." The sounds of "Powerful, powerful" reverberated throughout the prisoner group. The People's Liberation Army had over a hundred artillery pieces of various ranges on the northern city front. When various artillery pieces opened fire on the enemy, the entire northern city wall was engulfed in smoke. On the morning of the 15th, our artillery bombarded the Yuncheng Old Victory Gate. Two hundred meters of the city wall was shattered to pieces. Of the two mountain guns of Cheng Lianfang and Wang Yujun, 237 out of 240 shells fired hit their targets. The 7th company of the Chiang Kai-shek 369th regiment, guarding the northern city wall, was either injured or killed by our artillery fire, except for eight men who were taken prisoner. When these Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers, who had laid down their weapons, mentioned the People's Liberation Army's artillery fire, they were truly "terrified at the mere mention of it."

　　运城被俘蒋军
  　赞扬我军炮兵
    【本报晋南前线四日电】人民解放军攻击运城的炮火，空前集中与猛烈。被俘蒋匪官兵见面就说“你们的炮火真厉害，一炮就可以轰塌城楼，你们的炮兵一开火，我们就抬不起头来了”“厉害，厉害”的声音遍及整个俘虏中。人民解放军各种射程炮在城北一线就有百门以上，当各种炮向敌人开火时，整个北城墙上即被烟雾所淹没。十五日晨，我炮兵轰击运城旧胜门，二百米达的城墙，被炸的支离破碎，程连芳、王玉俊的两门山炮，发射二百四十发炮弹中，就有二百三十七发命中，守于北城墙上的蒋匪三六九团七连除八人留作俘虏外，其余皆遭我炮火轰伤或毙命。这些放下武器的蒋军官兵，当他们提起人民解放军的炮火时真有点儿“谈虎变色”。
