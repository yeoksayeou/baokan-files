[This dispatch from our Jilu Yu headquarters on January 15th] Our local troops have once again recovered the city of Dongping, with the majority of the defending enemy forces annihilated. On the evening of January 6th at 10:00 PM, a certain unit of our local troops launched an offensive against Dongping, clearing all the outer strongholds by 3:00 AM on the 7th. At 5:00 AM, a general assault was launched, and within just over ten minutes, they breached the city, engaging the enemy in street fighting. By 12:00 PM, the headquarters of the enemy’s Shandong 3rd Security Brigade, the majority of the brigade's 17th Regiment, and the majority of the Dongping Security Regiment were eliminated. Only the 2nd Battalion of the 17th Regiment and a unit of approximately 500 soldiers of the Dongping Security Regiment fled north, and Dongping was thus recovered by our forces. In this battle, a total of 345 enemy troops including the 3rd Security Brigade's Deputy Commander Zhang Cenxiu were killed or wounded, and 1,030 were captured including the Security Brigade's Deputy Adjutant Director Wang Chaodong and the Dongping Self-Defense Regiment Leader Su Chengyan. The spoils of war included ten light machine guns, 691 rifles, one portable machine gun, one carbine, 45,419 rounds of ammunition of various types, 23 warhorses, one radio station, four telephones, and a large quantity of other military supplies.
