　　Xiuwu Militia Team Actively Protects Grain
  　Repels Chiang Kai-shek/Puppet Troops' Thousand-Man Attack
    [Taihang News] Recently, the Xiuwu Second and Third District Militia Teams and Public Security Plainclothes Teams have been actively operating along the Daoqing Railway Line. On the 14th of this month, in a single day, they captured or wounded another 22 enemy soldiers. When enemies from Xin'an Township, colluding with the puppet Bao'an (security) Regiment of Daiwang Town and the puppet Self-Defense Regiment of Bo'ai, totaling over a thousand men, launched a three-pronged attack to seize grain in the Shangma and Majie villages of the Xiuwu Third District, our Third District Militia Team and Public Security Plainclothes Team bravely resisted and repelled the enemy. The enemy abandoned most of the looted materials and suffered 4 killed and 14 wounded. We also seized one rifle, 30 bullets, three hand grenades, and one overcoat. On the same day, our Second District Militia Team in Shuizhai Village also captured alive four individuals, including the puppet county magistrate's guard and secretary, Wang Shuke, and the police station platoon leader, Fan Yingming, along with two pistols.
