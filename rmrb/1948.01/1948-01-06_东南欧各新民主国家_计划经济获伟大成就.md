Reports from various sources indicate that the planned economies of the new democratic countries in Southeast Europe have achieved considerable success. In Poland, despite the tremendous damage from the war, overall industrial production has reached pre-war levels, with the heavy industry sector exceeding them. Coal miners completed their annual plan ahead of schedule on December 20th, exporting 17 million tons of coal by December 15th. Tractor manufacturing has been established. Production of agricultural machinery and fertilizers exceeds pre-war levels. This year's train freight volume also exceeds pre-war levels. In the western territories alone, there are 1,215 state-owned factories, accounting for 30 percent of the national total, employing 304,000 workers.

In Yugoslavia, production in all industrial sectors this year has exceeded pre-war levels, with production increasing by 58 percent in one year. Investment in the first half of this year was more than double that of the first half of last year. Two hundred large industrial enterprises have begun construction. The largest iron factory near Ljubljana recently began operations. There was a bumper harvest of wheat and corn. American and British reactionaries attempted to create a budget deficit in Yugoslavia by stopping UNRRA aid, but in the first half of this year, Yugoslavia's budget had a surplus of 6 billion dinars in revenue over expenditure.

In Bulgaria, industrial production has also exceeded last year. Industries such as rubber, textiles, paper, and coal mining have increased by more than 28 percent. In the first five months of this year, 49 percent of the annual electrification plan and large industrial construction was completed. The number of industrial workers reached over 166,000, breaking historical records. Foreign trade increased by 88 percent compared to last year.

In Czechoslovakia, the parliament unanimously passed the 1948 budget on the 19th. The new budget reflects the further growth of the Czech economy. The new budget's revenue is 56.9 billion Czech crowns (44.7 billion in 1947), and expenditure is 68.95 billion Czech crowns. Education expenditure accounts for 10.5 percent of the budget (compared to only 5.5 percent before the war). The largest portion of the budget will be used to develop various sectors of the national economy, and defense expenditure has been reduced by 1.3 billion compared to this year.

In Romania, youth volunteer teams built a large gas pipeline, 753 kilometers long, in 40 days. Gas delivery began before December 10th, supplying industrial areas in Bucharest, Prahova, and Brasov.

When the law was passed, all members of parliament and thousands of people outside the venue cheered in unison. After hearing the decision, workers in factories across the country also held meetings, unanimously supporting the government's confiscation of factories and enterprises from capitalists and exploiters; and guaranteed to fully improve product quality and further launch labor competitions. A resolution of the Sofia Citizens' Congress stated: This matter "has historical significance and guarantees Bulgaria's political and economic independence."
