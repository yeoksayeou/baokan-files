　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Moscow dispatch: The movement to "Complete the Five-Year Plan in Four Years" is unfolding in depth throughout the Soviet Union. The recent Trade Union Congress has resolved to call on tens of millions of workers across the Soviet Union to take "completing the Five-Year Plan in Four Years" as the fundamental task after the war. Workers at the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, the largest steel center in Europe, sent a letter to Stalin on the 6th, guaranteeing to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. The miners of the Donbass coal mines, which were almost completely destroyed by the German bandits during the war, unanimously guaranteed to complete the plan one year ahead of schedule. Among them, the miners of the largest Donbass Tolasse even guaranteed to complete the plan by the end of this year. This movement has penetrated into every worker among the most advanced workers in Leningrad, and everyone has made their own plans, and many heroic stories have emerged. Bakunin, a fitter at a train repair shop, completed 11,600 percent of his daily production plan in five hours on the 29th of last month. Stepanov, a Stakhanovite worker at the "Bolshevik" factory, guaranteed to do five years of work in one year. Kisteyevko, Veretimirov, and Otmissolov, workers at the automatic machine factory, each guaranteed to do the work of four to five people.
