　　【Taiyue News】 In the cooperative of seven villages including Hancun in the Fifth District of Changzi County, class enemies were put in charge, squandering the capital of the masses at will. The Changzi County United Cooperative recently conducted an investigation and found that the cooperatives in seven villages in the Fifth District, including Hancun, Zhangzhuang, Duanzhuang, Northeast Changcun, Northwest Daicun, Hecun, and Baodian, did not organize and lead farmers in production, but instead moved from the villages to the towns to engage in trade. Their reasoning was: there are fewer opportunities to make money in the countryside, and running a cooperative in the town will definitely make money. Looking at the actual situation of the Hecun cooperative, it moved to Baodian Town in the ninth month of the lunar calendar last year to open a dye shop and a grocery store. This cooperative collected 80,000 yuan from the sale of seven dan, two dou, seven sheng, and two ge of grain by the farmers of Hecun. So far, it has only earned 50,000 yuan. After deducting the monthly rent of one dan of rice and the food and drink of the five people in the cooperative, it will still lose 8,360 yuan. If the grain invested by the farmers is calculated according to the current market price, seven dan, two dou, seven sheng, and two ge of rice total 138,168 yuan, then it will lose 66,528 yuan. The remaining six cooperatives have lost a total of 2.68 million yuan so far, equivalent to 140 dan and five sheng of millet. If this grain were given to farmers as capital for winter production, how many production difficulties of hired and poor peasants would be solved? After inspection by the County United Cooperative, it was discovered that there were thirteen class enemies in these seven cooperatives, and one was even serving as the manager. They often ate white flour, wasting the capital of the farmers. Now the County United Cooperative has ordered them all to move back to the villages and be reformed by the farmers.

　　【Shexian News】 The Ninth District United Cooperative was newly established in the twelfth month of the lunar calendar last year, and landlords Zhang Pengming, Li Tianhou, and three others infiltrated it. They thought that others could not do the job and that they were indispensable. They often flaunted their power and status in front of the farmers, putting on airs. When he went home, he rode a horse. When selling things to farmers in the store, he insisted on fixed prices, like the old pawnbrokers. He did business in the cooperative for one penny, make one penny, if there was nothing to be made he wouldn't do it, in the first half of the year every yuan earned a dividend of thirteen cents. The masses reflected that investing in the cooperative was not as good as keeping the money at home. During the review, the landlord Li Tianhou even hid his brother in his cabinet to avoid struggle. They secretly bought more than a dozen fountain pens and did not pay taxes, which resulted in the confiscation of the fountain pens by the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. During the three checks, these landlords were squeezed out and replaced with several farmers who showed practical work in all aspects, very actively whether in mass work or business work, one person can do the work of two. The landlords were afraid of work when they were there, now they are looking for work. The landlords made one penny profit with one penny of capital, the current accountant doesn't care whether there is capital or not, he must do the work. There has also been an improvement in cigarette rolling technology. In terms of earning dividends, the landlords earned a dividend of thirteen cents per yuan in the first half of the year. After the landlords were squeezed out, the calculation for four months was that each yuan earned a dividend of more than thirty cents. During the meeting for self-criticism, everyone said: "Being capable is not as good as being practical." Li Sanhai (poor peasant) said: Others did the work, but didn't let us do it, we can't do it, with our skills, just use all of them.

　　长子七个村合作社地主把持大赔本
    【太岳消息】长子县五区韩村等七村合作社，叫斗争对象当了家，随便浪费群众本钱。长子县联社最近做了调查，五区有韩村、章庄、段庄、东北常村、西北带村、河村、鲍店七村合作社，不组织领导农民生产，却从村里搬到城里镇上做买卖。他们的理由是：农村赚钱机会少，到城里办合作社一定能赚钱。实际看看河村合作社，从去年阴历九月就搬到鲍店镇开染坊和杂货铺，这个合作社是河村农民卖了七石二斗七升二合粮食集了八万元的本钱，到现在才赚了五万元，除过每一月一石米的房价和社里的五个人的吃喝，还要赔八千三百六十元。要是把农民入股的粮食按现在市价算，七石二斗七升二合米共折十三万八千一百六十八块钱，那就要赔六万六千五百二十八元。其余的六个合作社，到现在共赔了二百六十八万元，合小米一百四十石零五升。如果把这些粮食交给农民做冬季生产的本钱，要解决多少雇贫农的生产困难？县联社经过检查后，发现了这七个合作社里就有十三个斗争对象，还有一个当着经理，他们经常吃的白面，把农民的本钱都浪费了，现在县联社叫他们都搬回村去，让农民改造。
    【涉县消息】九区区联社是去年阴历腊月新成立的，钻进地主张朋明、李天厚等五人。他们自以为其他人干不了，离了他就不行，在农民面前常抖他的威风，摆他的架子。他回家时骑着马。在门市部卖东西对农民说话是言无二价，象过去的开当铺的。他在社内做生意有一个钱，做一个钱，没有就不干，前半年每元钱赚红利一角三分。群众反映在社里入股还不如在家放着。在复查时地主李天厚还把他兄弟藏在他的柜房里逃避斗争。他们偷买了十几枝钢笔，不给税，结果被工商局查出，钢笔没收了。三查时把这些地主挤走了，换了几个农民干，各方面表现了实干，无论对群众工作、对业务工作都很积极，一个顶两个。地主在是怕有活，现在是找活。地主是一毛本钱做一毛本钱，现在的会计不管有无本钱要干。在卷烟技术上也有提高。在赚红利上，地主在时半年赚红利每元一毛三。地主挤回后，四个月计算，每元赚红利三毛多。在开会检讨时，大家说：“能干不如实干”。李三孩（贫农）说：人家倒干了，就是不给干，咱干不了吧，就咱这些本事，全使上就行。（米换）
