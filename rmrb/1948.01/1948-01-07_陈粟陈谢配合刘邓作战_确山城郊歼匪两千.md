Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan, 5th: After annihilating the Fifth Corps Headquarters and the reorganized Third Division of the Chiang bandits, parts of the Chen Su and Chen Xie armies continued south along the Pinghan Railway to coordinate with the Liu and Deng armies in operations in the Dabie Mountains. On the evening of the 29th, they surrounded the Chiang bandit reorganized 23rd Division, which was reinforcing from the north, in the suburbs of Queshan, a strategic point in southern Henan. After two days of fierce fighting, two battalions of the division were annihilated in Sanlidian and Linzhuang, north of the city, and in the southern suburbs of the city, and more than 2,000 Chiang bandits defending the city were killed or wounded. The Chiang bandits, deeply fearing that Queshan would not be able to be defended and that the People's Liberation Army would take advantage of the victory to go straight to Wuhan, hastily transferred their main forces, such as the reorganized Ninth Division, the reorganized Tenth Division, and the reorganized Eleventh Division, from the Dabie Mountains to reinforce Queshan. Thus, the People's Liberation Army's predetermined mission of annihilating the enemy and mobilizing the enemy has been successfully completed.

　　陈粟陈谢配合刘邓作战
  　确山城郊歼匪两千
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线五日电】陈粟、陈谢大军各一部于歼灭蒋匪第五兵团司令部及整三师后，沿平汉路继续南下配合刘邓大军在大别山作战，于二十九日晚将北援之蒋匪整二十三师包围于豫南战略要点之确山城郊，经两日激战，歼灭该师两个营于城北之三里店、林庄及城之南郊，并毙伤守城蒋匪二千余人。蒋匪深恐确山不保，解放军乘胜直下武汉，遂仓皇自大别山抽调其主力整九师、整十师、整十一师等部增援确山。至此解放军歼敌并调动敌人之预定任务，已胜利完成。
