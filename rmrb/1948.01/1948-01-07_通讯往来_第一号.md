　　Communications Exchange

　　No. 1

　　To Comrades Correspondents in Various Regions:

　　Since the "Outline Land Law of China" was published in the newspaper, we have quickly received news from comrades correspondents in Wu'an, Licheng, Zuoquan, and Huguan, detailing the opinions of poor and hired peasants regarding the equal distribution of land. We hope that everyone will carefully study the Land Law, conscientiously and responsibly publicize and explain this decree to poor and hired peasants and all peasants with little or no land, listen to their opinions, and truthfully write down their opinions. Pay special attention to writing down the heartfelt words of poor and hired peasants, and see what their demands, concerns, and difficulties are. At the same time, write down the opinions of middle peasants and cadres. Regarding the supplementary measures to the Land Law Outline implemented by the Border Region Government, please also truthfully write down the opinions of the masses on the stipulated measures.

　　After the Land Law is implemented, are there any words or actions of landlords and rich peasants in the lower levels who interject, resist, or sabotage our decrees? Are there any people who pretend to support the Land Law and deliberately misread or misinterpret it? What is the biggest obstacle to the implementation of the Land Law in your area? We hope you will boldly expose it. Please prepare organizational reports on the rectification of the ranks by Party committees at all levels.

　　通讯往来
  　第一号各地通讯员同志：
    中国土地法大纲在报上登出后，我们很快就收到武安、黎城、左权、壶关各地通讯员同志写来的消息，说了不少贫雇农民对平分土地的意见。我们希望大家很好的研究土地法，认真负责的找到贫雇农及一切少地无地农民宣传解释这个法令，听他们发表意见，照实的写上他们的意见，特别注意写贫雇农的知心话，看他们有啥要求，有啥顾虑和困难。同时也要写中农及干部的意见。对于边府施行土地法大纲补充办法，所规定的办法，群众有些啥意见，也请你们照实写出来。
    土地法下去后，下面有没有地主、富农插嘴、抵抗和破坏咱们法令的言语行动。有没有人假装拥护土地法，故意把土地法念错讲错的事情。什么是你们那个地方执行土地法的最大的绊脚石，希望大胆揭发出来。各级党委整顿队伍的情形望准备组织报导。
