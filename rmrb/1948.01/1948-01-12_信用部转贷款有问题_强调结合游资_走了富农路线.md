　　Credit Cooperative On-lending Has Problems
  　Emphasizing Combination with Idle Capital
  　Took the Rich Peasant Route
    [Our Dispatch] In the fourth and fifth districts of Changzhi, most of the loans were transferred to credit cooperatives and a small number of cooperatives. In the fifth district, loans of 8,568,300 yuan were transferred to 18 credit cooperatives from 25 administrative villages, 1,080,000 yuan were transferred to four cooperatives, and 1,040,800 yuan were not transferred. In the fourth district, loans of 11,018,000 yuan were transferred to 28 credit cooperatives from 39 administrative villages, 1,730,000 yuan were transferred to six cooperatives, and 1,240,000 yuan were not transferred. Inspections of the on-lending process revealed that, although most of the funds were transferred, they had not truly reached the hands of the poor peasants and farm laborers. For example, in Loudi Village in the fifth district, all 500,000 yuan in loans were used by cadres. In Shitan Yu Village in the fourth district, of the 316,500 yuan in loans, three new middle peasant households borrowed 61,000 yuan, and seven old middle peasant households borrowed 220,500 yuan. One household that had been struggled against borrowed 20,000 yuan, which was used for medicine and noodles. One bankrupt landlord household borrowed 10,000 yuan, which was used to buy public grain. In Qinggang Village in the fifth district, the chairman of the trade union, a well-to-do middle peasant, (?) borrowed 30,000 yuan, did not use it himself, but lent it to the masses, earning a profit of two mao per yuan per month.
    When winter production began, the Credit Department of the Hukuan First District Federation of Cooperatives distributed 700,000 yuan in bank loans to support poor peasants and farm laborers' production, dividing it equally among the seven main villages and two natural villages in the sub-district, regardless of wealth, giving 100,000 yuan to each village.
    Based on the above inspection, in the past, when issuing loans, we only considered repayment ability, emphasizing combining with private capital and the use of funds, so most poor peasants and farm laborers did not dare to borrow, causing loans to be generally lent to middle peasants, and some even took the landlord and rich peasant route. In the on-lending process, we should conduct in-depth investigations and transfer the loans to poor peasants and farm laborers so that they do not feel financially strained during this winter's production.

　　信用部转贷款有问题
  　强调结合游资
  　走了富农路线
    【本报消息】长治四、五区的贷款，大部转到信用部及少数的合作社。五区二十五个行政村转到十八个信用部的贷款八百五十六万八千三百元，转到四个合作社一百零八万元，未转者一百零四万八百元。四区三十九个行政村转到二十八个信用部的贷款一千一百零一万八千元，转到六个合作社一百七十三万元，未转者一百二十四万元。在转贷检查中查出虽然大部都转了，但还没有真正贷到贫雇手里，如五区楼底村贷款五十万元，都是干部使用。四区石炭峪村贷款三十一万六千五百元，新中农三户贷六万一千元，旧中农七户贷廿二万五百元。被斗户一户，贷二万元，吃药吃面用了。破落地主一户，贷一万元，是买了公粮。五区青岗村工会主任是个富裕中农，（？）贷款三万元，自己不用贷给群众，每元每月得利二毛。
    壶关一区联社信用部在冬季生产开始时，把银行发放扶助贫雇生产贷款七十万元，以小区七个主村二个自然村不分贫富一律平均分配，每村十万元。
    根据以上的检查，过去发放贷款，在我们只是考虑偿还力，强调结合私资及用途，所以贫雇大部不敢贷款，使贷款普遍贷到中农身上，还有个别的走了地主富农路线，在转贷中应深入调查，转给贫雇，使他们今冬生产资金不感困难。（冀南三分行信贷小报）
