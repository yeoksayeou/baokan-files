　　Exceeding the Military Region's Enemy Killing Plan by Half
  　Taiyue Annihilates Six Thousand Enemies in Four Months
    [Taiyue News] The Taiyue Military Region troops, in the four months from September to December, eliminated more than six thousand enemies, exceeding the original enemy killing plan by more than two thousand four hundred. Last September, the Taiyue area troops, in order to coordinate with the main force's counter-offensive, launched an enemy-killing competition. The troops of each sub-district, as well as various local corps and guerrilla units, set their enemy-killing plans for the four months from September to December. The four-month enemy-killing plan of the first, second, and third sub-district troops alone was to eliminate four thousand enemies. After the plans were set, each unit hurried to find the enemy and fought many beautiful battles, receiving many commendations from the military region leaders. By the end of December, the three sub-districts had eliminated a total of six thousand seven hundred and sixty-three enemies in four months, killing and wounding two thousand seven hundred and forty-four, and capturing four thousand and nineteen alive. This exceeded the original plan by more than two thousand four hundred. They also seized seven mortars, ten heavy machine guns, one hundred and eighty-two light machine guns, one thousand eight hundred and forty-five rifles, one hundred and twenty-eight pistols, sixteen American submachine guns, forty-one small cannons and grenade launchers, and more than ninety-eight thousand rounds of ammunition. Among them, the first sub-district troops originally planned to eliminate one thousand nine hundred and ten enemies, but because they coordinated with the main force in fighting and undertook special tasks, they also eliminated one thousand three hundred and seventy-four enemies in four months, killing and wounding eight hundred and eighty-nine, and capturing four hundred and eighty-five alive. The second sub-district originally planned to eliminate eight hundred and ten enemies, and completed the four-month plan in fifty days. They eliminated a total of one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one enemies, killing and wounding six hundred and twenty-eight, and capturing one thousand two hundred and twenty-three alive, exceeding the original plan by more than double. The third sub-district eliminated two thousand five hundred and seventy enemies, killing and wounding nine hundred and forty-two, and capturing one thousand six hundred and twenty-eight alive, also exceeding the plan by more than double. There were no large enemy forces within the fourth sub-district's borders long ago. Their task was to clear out bandits and defend the riverfront. They repelled the attack of Zhang Bohua's bandit troops, and successively eliminated two hundred and fifty-five enemies, killing and wounding one hundred and five, and capturing one hundred and fifty alive. The fifth sub-district troops achieved great success in clearing out bandits in the Yuxi new district, making the Yuxi new district more consolidated day by day. In more than two months, they eliminated seven hundred and thirteen enemies, killing and wounding one hundred and eighty, and capturing five hundred and thirty-three alive.
