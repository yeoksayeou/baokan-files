Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. According to Shanghai newspapers: Wuhu, Anhui, one of China's four major rice markets, has seen soaring grain prices due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's exploitation, making it impossible for ordinary poor people to live. A rice-grabbing wave broke out on the 13th of this month. At 3:00 PM that day, more than twenty rickshaw pullers were buying flour at a noodle shop on Fuxing Road. While they were buying, the price of flour suddenly rose from 6,000 yuan to 8,000 yuan per jin. The rickshaw pullers and others were extremely resentful and immediately seized nine bags of flour and left. Poor people along the way responded en masse, swarming into a shop on Beiping Road and seizing rice, flour, and other items worth 2 million Chiang Kai-shek currency. They then moved to Jihe Street, where the crowd seizing rice had expanded to more than two hundred people, and the momentum grew larger and larger. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities panicked and dispatched military police to fire shots to suppress the unrest, and ordered all rice shops in the city to close down and suspend operations. Furthermore, it is reported that a rice-grabbing wave was also triggered in Chengdu at the beginning of the month due to soaring prices.

　　米市芜湖穷人没有饭吃
  　群起抢米抢面
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据沪报消息：中国四大米市之一的安徽芜湖，因蒋匪苛榨，粮价猛涨，一般贫苦人民无法生活，本月十三日爆发抢米风潮。该日下午三时有二十多个车夫在福兴路面店购买面粉，正在买面时，面价突由每斤六千元涨到八千元，车夫等恨极了，马上抢了九袋面粉而去，沿途贫民群起响应，拥入北平路某店抢走价值二百万蒋币的米面等物，再转到吉和街，抢米群众已扩展二百余人，声势愈来愈大。蒋匪当局慌忙出动军警鸣枪镇压，并令全市米店均关门停市。又讯：月初成都亦因物价飞涨，引起抢米风潮。
