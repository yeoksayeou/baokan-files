Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, January 24th:

　　Wang Shaoqi, Chiang Kai-shek bandit Northeast Military Control Bureau No. 134 special agent, who voluntarily confessed at the anti-Chiang Kai-shek meeting of the Harbin Liberated Military Officers Corps last December, recently published an article titled "My Confession" in the "Liberated Armyman" column of the Northeast Daily here, painfully recounting his various counter-revolutionary crimes in the past. The article first states that he is from Zhuoxian County, Hebei Province, and studied at Luhe Middle School in Tongxian County. In 1944, he formally joined the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Military Control Bureau special agent organization. After Japan surrendered, he was sent to Shenyang and Jinzhou to carry out activities. He described his crimes of infiltrating our army, saying: "I took the opportunity to disguise myself and infiltrate the Democratic Allied Army. In Zhangwu and Fuxin, I also bought off two lackeys, Yang Hangzhou and Pei Zhenwu. We secretly carried out various reactionary propaganda in the army. Later, the political commissar discovered that I often liked to talk strangely behind people's backs and sent me to the military region's training team to study. However, he still didn't know I was a special agent. When I left, he said to me: Your thinking is relatively backward, you must study hard.
　　After I arrived at the training team, I continued to carry out activities, and I also met a Kuomintang Youth League special agent, Liu Yating. The two of us then cooperated, often eavesdropping on cadres' meetings and stealing important documents, such as the unit's work plan and the bi-weekly passwords.
　　Once, Liu Yating colluded with the bandit leader Zhang Tongxuan (whom Chiang Kai-shek had appointed as a military commander) to attack the Democratic Allied Army, and we prepared to act as internal support. However, the bandit Hu was ambushed by the Democratic Allied Army on the way and was completely annihilated, so our plan failed. After that, Liu Yating tried to assassinate the political commissar but was caught. Because I was afraid of being implicated, I disguised myself and secretly deserted, fleeing the liberated area."
　　In May 1946, after he fled to Jinzhou, he was sent to Shenyang for training. In Shenyang, he was ordered to use American poison to assassinate a democratic person named Chen in a restaurant. After the murder, he also said that this person died in the restaurant from "cholera" and had the police seal off the restaurant. He described the situation in Shenyang where he was ordered to suppress workers' demands for wage increases and carry out shameless anti-Soviet conspiracies: "In June, workers at the Tiexi Automobile Factory in Shenyang demanded a wage increase. The factory director reported to the (Chiang Kai-shek) commander's office, saying that there were Communist activities among the workers. I and Nos. 137 and 138 workers were sent to investigate. We sneaked into the factory and investigated for a few days without any clues. In order to complete our mission, we fired a few shots one night when people weren't prepared. The workers panicked and ran out, so we falsely accused the workers of attempting to riot and arrested nineteen workers and sent them to the (Chiang Kai-shek) commander's office. Later, I heard that they were dealt with as Communists.
　　In Shenyang, the Military Control Bureau also carried out conspiracies to sabotage Sino-Soviet relations, deliberately fabricating facts, spreading rumors, and sowing discord. Once, I and Nos. 137 and 132 followed a Soviet person and walked near Peace Park. Seeing that person whispering with another person, we thought their actions were suspicious and immediately pounced on them. It turned out that the hair was dyed and the big nose was also fake. After repeated questioning, we realized that it was also a special agent from the Military Control Bureau, specializing in disguising themselves as Soviet people, doing many bad things, and using this to sabotage Sino-Soviet relations. The next day, the newspaper published a news item in large headlines: Soviet spies were active near Peace Park, attempting to assassinate a senior official of ours, fortunately discovered by our detective team, and finally captured after a fierce fight."
　　In the autumn of the same year, he was transferred to the Provisional Third Division and sent to Zhangwu to recruit new soldiers, colluding with bandit Hu to sabotage the Inner Mongolia People's Self-Defense Army and frame our democratic government county and district cadres. A district political commissar was once captured by him and sent to the Shenyang concentration camp. County Magistrate Fan of Lubei (newly established county north of Rehe Kailu) was also ambushed and captured by him, but later rescued by the People's Liberation Army. The Northeast Chiang Kai-shek military authorities, in order to cover up their military failures, carried out deceptive propaganda and forced the captured recruits to admit that they were captured Democratic Allied Army soldiers. He wrote: "The Shenyang (Chiang Kai-shek) commander's office constantly falsely reported to Nanjing that it had captured hundreds or thousands of Eighth Route Army soldiers. Before the (Chiang Kai-shek) Ministry of National Defense sent people to inspect, the (Chiang Kai-shek) commander's office sent people to the new recruits and said: Do you want to wear American military uniforms? Do you want to eat white rice and flour? When the inspection commissioners come, as long as you admit that you are Eighth Route Army prisoners, everything can be solved. These new recruits are like prisoners, how dare they say no? When the inspection commissioners arrived, the new recruits lined up and shouted: We are defectors! We were captured! The three fake prisoner-of-war units were later reorganized into the Youth Training Corps by the (Chiang Kai-shek) Ministry of National Defense. These new recruits had two numbers, belonging to the Provisional Third Division and the Training Corps at the same time. They made two sets of rosters every month and received two sets of salaries. But these new recruits still couldn't wear or eat well, and they couldn't get either salary."
　　Wang Shaoqi deeply hates his past counter-revolutionary crimes of slaughtering the people. At the end of his article, he said: "I have done so many evil things, and now I think I deserve to die. But I never thought that I would be lucky enough to be rescued by the Democratic Allied Army, and they educated me and made me realize my past sins."

　　蒋匪东北军统局特务
  　王少奇自供他干的坏事
    【新华社东北二十四日电】年前十二月曾在哈尔滨解放军官团反蒋大会上自动坦白的蒋匪东北军统局第一三四号特务王少奇，顷在此间东北日报“解放军人”栏，发表“我的自白”一文，痛述其从前反革命种种罪行。该文首述其为河北涿县人，曾在通县潞河中学读书，一九四四年正式参加蒋匪军统局特务组织。日本投降后，被派赴沈阳、锦州一带活动。他叙述其渗入我军种种罪行称：“我乘机伪装渗入民主联军，在彰武、阜新一带，我又收买了杨航舟、裴振武两个腿子。我们在部队里秘密进行各种反动的宣传，过后政委发觉我经常喜欢背人讲怪话，把我送到军区教导队去学习。但他还不知我是特务，临走时还对我说：你的思想比较落后，要好好的学习。
    我到了教导队后依然进行活动，并且我又认识了一个三青团的特务刘亚亭。我们两个便合作一起，时常窃听干部开会和偷盗重要文件，如部队工作计划和半月的口令等，都偷出来过。
    有一次，刘亚亭勾结匪首张桐轩（蒋匪曾委为军长）来袭击民主联军，我们准备作内应。但胡匪在半路遭民主联军伏击，整个被歼，因此我们的计划流产了。此后刘亚亭谋刺政委不成被捉，我因为怕牵连，就化装偷偷的开了小差，逃出解放区。”
    一九四六年五月他逃到锦州后，又被派往沈阳受训。他在沈阳奉命以美国毒药，在饭馆暗杀了一个陈姓的民主人士，害了以后还说此人系在饭馆“患虎烈拉”而死，让警察封闭了那家饭馆。他叙述在沈阳受命镇压工人增资要求及进行无耻反苏阴谋情形称：“六月间，沈阳铁西汽车工厂工人要求增加工资，厂长报告（蒋匪）长官部，说工人里面有共产党活动。我和一三七、一三八号等工人被派去调查。我们混进工厂查了几天毫无头绪。我们为了交代公事，就在一个夜里乘人不备打了几枪。工人们惊慌地跑出来，于是我们诬陷工人企图暴动，便捉了十九个工人送到（蒋匪）长官部，后来听说把他们当作共产党办了。
    在沈阳，军统局还进行破坏中苏邦交的阴谋，故意虚构事实，散布谣言，挑拨是非。有一次，我和一三七、一三二号，跟踪一个苏联人，走到和平公园附近，见那人与另外一人窃窃私语。我们以为行踪可疑，立即扑上前去，原来头发是染色的，大鼻子也是装上的。再三追问，才晓得同样是军统局的特务专门化装成苏联人，做出许多坏事，借此来破坏中苏邦交。第二天，报纸上用大字标题登着一段新闻：苏联间谍在和平公园附近活动，企图暗杀我某高级长官，幸为我侦缉队员发觉，经猛烈格斗后，终将其擒获云。”
    同年秋后，他调至暂编第三师，被派往彰武招募新兵，勾结胡匪，破坏内蒙人民自卫军，陷害我民主政府县区干部。曾有一个区政委被他捕捉送往沈阳集中营，解放区鲁北（热河开鲁北新设县）范县长亦曾为其设伏俘虏，后被解放军救出。东北蒋匪军事当局为掩饰其军事失败，进行欺骗宣传，曾强迫被抓来的新兵承认是被俘的民主联军。他写道：“沈阳（蒋匪）长官部曾不断向南京捏报俘虏八路军几百几千。（蒋匪）国防部派人点检之前，（蒋匪）长官部就派人对新兵说：你们想穿美式军装吗？你们想吃大米白面吗？点检委员来时，只要你们承认是八路俘虏，一切全可解决。这些新兵如同囚犯，他们还敢说个不字吗？点检委员来了，新兵便整队高呼：我们是投诚过来的！我们是被俘来的！三个假俘虏部队，事后被（蒋匪）国防部编为青年训导总队。这批新兵有了两个番号，一方面属于暂三师，同时又是训总队。每月造两份名册，领两份薪养。但这些新兵依旧是穿不上吃不上，两份饷，一份也捞不着。”
    王少奇深恨其以前种种反革命、屠杀人民的罪行，他在文章结尾称：“我做了这许许多多的罪恶事情，现在想来真是死有余辜。但想不到我幸运的获得了民主联军的解救，并教育了我，使我认清了自己过去的罪恶。”
