    To all branch offices and correspondents: We have the following requests for your reference:
    1.  What is the status of studying Chairman Mao's report, the Land Law Outline of China (including supplementary regulations in this region), and other important documents? What are the experiences, problems (we will be responsible for answering), and the experiences in publicizing the Land Law? What are the specific reactions of poor peasants, farm laborers, middle peasants, village cadres, and industrialists and merchants after hearing about the Land Law?
    2.  What behaviors are undermining the Land Law? Have they been stopped? How were they stopped?
    3.  Typical reflections of cadres from different backgrounds in local land conferences.
    4.  What achievements have been made in winter production? Does the leadership fully satisfy the demands of the poor peasants and farm laborers while consolidating the unity of the middle peasants in production? What difficulties do the poor peasants and farm laborers still have? Is there any phenomenon of the interests of the middle peasants being harmed?
    5.  We request correspondents to write down the heartfelt words, calls, and demands of the poor peasants, farm laborers and other farmers on their behalf. What are their dissatisfactions, things they dare not say, or any major grievances? All can be written and sent to us, and we will open a special column to publish them in the future. Regarding the attitude of writing, we suggest referring to the spirit of the third correspondence, promoting the advantages, exposing and criticizing the shortcomings, avoiding one-sidedness, avoiding exaggeration, and being realistic and truthful.

　　通讯往来
  　第四号
    各分社，各地通讯员同志，我们有如下要求供你们参考：
    一、学习毛主席报告、中国土地法大纲（包括本区补充条例）及其它重要文件的情况，经验，各种问题（我们当负责解答）以及宣传土地法的经验和贫雇、中农、村干、工商业者听了土地法后的具体反映？
    二、有那些破坏土地法的行为？是否制止了？如何制止的？
    三、各地土地会议中各种不同出身干部的典型反省。
    四、冬季生产有些啥成绩？领导上是不是充分满足贫雇要求，同时又巩固的团结中农进行生产？贫雇仍有何困难？中农利益有无被损害现象？
    五、要求通讯员为雇贫及农民们代笔，写下他们的知心话、呼声、要求，他们有些什么不满意，不敢说的话，有什么大的冤枉事？都可写来，我们今后专开一栏发表。写稿的态度，建议参考第三号通讯往来的精神，发扬优点，揭露与批评缺点，不要片面，不要夸大，有啥说啥，实事求是。
    六、阴历年关的准备及过年情形。
