[Military Industry Department News] The entire staff of Branch × of one of our factories in the Military Industry Department, in the campaign to strive to become a Liu Bocheng Factory and to support the counter-offensive on the southern front, demonstrated the high degree of creativity and initiative of the working class, starting early and working late every day for production. When things were intense, it was past midnight, and the bellows and iron hammer sounds in the workshop roared. Some worked until after 8 PM to process. Taking March's production as 100%, production increased monthly, reaching 300% in December, an increase of two-fold. There were also significant achievements in improving quality. The scrap rate for tail fins decreased from 1.52% to 0.2%, and the scrap rate for iron sheets decreased from 2.17% to 1.6%. In terms of technical improvements: Comrade Peng Yuqing lengthened the bellows from three feet to three feet six inches, making it more powerful and easier to use than before. It used to only be able to fire three materials, but now it can fire four. The furnace was enlarged, allowing fire to pass through both sides, increasing the number of tail fins mounted each time by 285% compared to before. The tail fin firing was changed from charcoal to coal dust, which not only reduced burning but also greatly saved costs. The number of iron sheet layers was increased from twenty-four to thirty-six, making the product thickness more uniform and increasing the quantity by 135%. The value of voluntary labor for gold conservation last year totaled 1,893,764 yuan.

　　军工处某厂
  　一年内增产两倍
    【军工处消息】我一厂×分厂全体职工在争取刘伯承工厂立功运动和支援南线反攻中，表现出工人阶级的高度创造性和积极性，每天起早搭黑的进行生产，紧张时夜间才过了十二点，工房的风箱和铁头声都吼叫起来，晚上有的加工至八点多钟才歇。生产上如以三月份生产为百分之百，逐月增加，至十二月份增加至百分之三百，增加了二倍。质量的提高也有显著成绩，弹尾报废量由百分之一点五二减至百分之零点二，铁皮报废量由百分之二点一七减至百分之一点六。技术改进上：彭玉清同志把风箱加长，由三尺改成三尺六寸，比从前风大又好用，过去只能烧三根料，现在能烧四根，蒙炉加大，炉里两边都能通火，每次蒙弹尾比前增加百分之二百八十五。弹尾由烧炭改为烧煤面，不但减少烧化，而且大为节约经济。铁皮层数增加，由二十四层加至三十六层，产品厚薄较匀，数量增加百分之一百三十五。黄金节约义务工去年共一百八十九万三千七百六十四元。
