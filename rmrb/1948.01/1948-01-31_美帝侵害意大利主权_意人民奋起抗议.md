　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 29th: Rome dispatch: The Italian working people continue to oppose the outrageous actions of U.S. imperialism in infringing upon Italian sovereignty. The working people of Brindisi and Lecce (both in southern Italy, on the Adriatic coast) have gone on strike to protest the arrival of U.S. warships and marines in Taranto and Brindisi. The executive committee of the Rome trade union has resolved to protest the U.S. imperialist infringement of Italian sovereignty. The executive committee of the People's Democratic Front in Bari has also called on the people of the Apulia Province to rise up and protest the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism. Italian democratic newspapers vehemently condemn the fact that the Gasperi government, fearing the rising democratic forces, does not hesitate to let the wolf into the house and sells the air force base near Tripoli to U.S. imperialism. L'Unità claims this is a "shameless plan by American warmongers to suppress the peoples of the Mediterranean."
