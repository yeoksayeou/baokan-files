Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 6th: After our army liberated Luohe City, it immediately provided widespread relief to the poor, including demobilized KMT military officers and employees of the Executive Yuan's branch office. The newly formed Yellow River Flood Area Refugee Relief Committee provided grain and clothing to thousands of refugees in the city and actively helped them return home to distribute land and houses and rebuild their homes. On the afternoon of the 20th of last month, a political organ of our army convened a forum for unemployed KMT military officers. More than 700 officers, from colonels to second lieutenants, attended. Most of them were "miscellaneous troops" or not from military academies, and some were abandoned because of injuries or disabilities sustained during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the civil war. At the meeting, they all accused the KMT bandits of their crimes. Liu Shaoquan, a demobilized lieutenant adjutant from the 38th Division, had pulled rickshaws, sold oranges, shined shoes, and wandered around Chongqing, Hankou, and Nanjing. He was imprisoned three times by the KMT government and finally deported and ended up in Luohe City as a petty thief. After the Liberation Army arrived this time, each demobilized officer received 100 bags of rice as temporary relief, and later, sufficient travel expenses were issued to those who volunteered to return home. On the first day after the liberation of Luohe, more than 200 people were subsidized to return home. Nineteen employees of the Henan Branch of the Executive Yuan did not leave Luohe, and their lives and property were protected. They had not been paid for three months and requested relief, so our army immediately issued them 2,000 catties of rice. They were deeply moved and automatically helped with the relief work. In total, our army distributed 1 million catties of rice and wheat in Luohe City, and about 50,000 people, one-third of the city's population, received relief. Countless people from the surrounding villages came upon hearing the news. On the first day after liberation, even though the enemy in Yancheng was still shelling, tens of thousands of people were crowded at the station to collect grain.

　　我军解放漯河市后
  　五万贫民得到救济
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线六日电】我军解放漯河市后，即广泛救济贫民，包括编余蒋军军官及行总分署职工。新组成的黄泛区难民救济委员会给市内数千黄泛区难民以粮食及衣物，积极帮助他们回家去分田分房，重整家园。上月二十日下午我军某政治机关曾召集了蒋军失业军官举行座谈会，到会有上校至少尉军官七百多名，他们多半因为是“杂牌”或非军校出身，有的则是在抗战和内战中因伤残废，而被撇弃。会上他们纷纷控诉蒋匪的罪恶。三十八师编余中尉副官刘少泉，拉过洋车、卖过橘子、擦过皮鞋，流浪于重庆、汉口、南京，被蒋匪政府关过三次，最后被驱逐出境而流落漯河市上作小偷。这次解放军到后，各编余军官即得到了一百包大米作为临时救济，后又按各人志愿发给充足的旅费回家。漯河解放后第一天就资助两百多人回家。行总河南分署有十九个职员没有退出漯河，他们的生命财产都得到了保护。他们已有三个月没有发薪，请求救济，我军当即发给他们两千斤大米。他们深受感动，自动帮助进行救济工作。总计我军在漯河市发放了一百万斤大米和小麦，市内三分之一的人口约五万人获得了救济。四乡人民闻讯而来的不计其数。在解放后第一天，虽然郾城敌人还在发炮，车站上领粮的人，已万头钻动，拥挤不堪。
