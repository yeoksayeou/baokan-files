Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. According to comprehensive reports from various sources: American monopoly capital's economic aggression against China, with the full assistance of the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek government, is advancing rapidly. Since Zhang Kou publicly issued a formal statement in August on "Foreign Investment and Technical Cooperation in China," three American companies, namely China Universal Tobacco Company, Nelson Company, and Anderson Meyer & Co., have negotiated to set up factories in China. Universal Tobacco Company plans to set up a cigarette factory and directly engage in planting and distributing tobacco; Nelson Company plans to establish a tannery and promote its products; Meyer Company plans to establish a machine factory in Shanghai to manufacture electrical, medical, and other equipment. In response, Gu Yu@, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chiang gang's National Economic Commission, in order to curry favor with his American masters, obsequiously stated: "The committee has immediately approved this application," and triumphantly told a reporter from the semi-official American news agency United Press that he hoped "foreign capitalists will abandon their doubts and accept China's (Chiang's) invitation," fully exposing the Chiang gang authorities' traitorous and foreign-flattering ugliness. At the same time, American monopoly capital's aggression plans in Central and South China are being actively implemented, such as investing in Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces, with the scope including opening commercial ports, establishing machinery, electricity, shipbuilding, chemical, textile, agriculture, fishery, and other light and heavy industries. Investment in more than 20 enterprises in Guangdong and Guangxi alone amounts to 250 million US dollars. American imperialism is also preparing to raise and control the Shanghai Electric Power United Company with 12 million US dollars.

　　卖国贼蒋介石
  　竟请美国来开大公司
    【新华社陕北六日电】综合各方报导：美国独占资本对中国经济侵略，在蒋介石卖国政府全力协助下，长驱直入。自八月间张口发表“关于外人来华投资及技术合作”的正式声明后不久，即有中国环球烟草公司、纳尔逊公司和安特逊·梅亚有限公司等三家美商洽商来华设厂。环球烟草公司拟设卷烟厂并直接从事种植与分配烟草；纳尔逊公司拟设立制革厂及推销其制品；梅亚公司则拟在上海设立一机器工厂，制造电气、医疗及其他设备。对此蒋匪全国经委会副秘书长顾毓＠为向美国主子邀功，奴气十足地供称：“该会已立即核准此项申请”，并得意忘形地对美半官方通讯社合众社记者表示并希望“外国资本家将放弃彼等之怀疑而应中国（蒋）之邀请”，充分暴露了蒋匪当局卖国媚外丑态。同时美独占资本对华中、华南的侵略计划正在积极实施，如投资两广、湖南、湖北等省，其范围包括开辟商埠，建立机器、电力、造船、化学、纺织、农业、渔业等等各种轻重工业，仅投资于两广二十余企业金额即达二亿五千万美元。美帝国主义并准备以一千二百万美元，筹设及控制上海电力联合公司。
