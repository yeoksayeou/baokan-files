[Jinan News] In response to the masses' reflections that "the regular burden is not felt to be too heavy, but the village grain and miscellaneous expenses are unaffordable," the Wu Yi County government proposed strictly rectifying village finances, requiring mass management, and made the following decisions: 1. Clear up outstanding village-level cases. 2. Strictly implement the rule that villages have no right to allocate grain, and establish a local grain management committee to control village grain expenditures and various systems. In the future, all agencies are not allowed to ask villages for things casually, or borrow from villages for extended periods without approval. When working in the village, the meal system will still be implemented. Comply with the requisitioning regulations. Villages have the right to immediately refuse those who requisition without a requisitioning certificate. Village cadres' training and militia deployment are not allowed to demand money from the village or have extra requests. Manpower, animal power, and vehicles will take turns on duty. Those who violate the system and privately allocate grain funds will be dealt with promptly. 3. Village office expenses must have a certain system and must not be wasted. If there is a special use, a budget can be made and submitted to the district for approval. Education expenses and other expenses will be uniformly collected and reimbursed by the village finance officer. Newspaper expenses will be uniformly distributed by the county.
