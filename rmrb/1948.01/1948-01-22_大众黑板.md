    Let me tell you some good news: the day for us to completely turn ourselves around has arrived! The Land Law Outline stipulates: all the landlords' land and property will be confiscated, the surplus land and property of rich peasants will be taken over, and the village's public land, temple land, and ancestral hall land will also be taken out; we peasants will be in charge of dividing it equally, one share per person, so we can completely turn ourselves around. In previous years, we made revolution, but it wasn't thorough enough. Some landlords and rich men had family members who became cadres, and they shielded their families, so these people weren't struggled against thoroughly. The things that were struggled out weren't divided fairly either; some cadres took more, "big tenants" got more, and military dependents also got more; as a result, we poor people got less.
    Now, by following the Land Law, these problems will be corrected. As long as he is a landlord, no matter who he has in his family or what high-ranking cadre he is; no matter how strong his backing is; his land and property must be completely confiscated. As long as he is a rich peasant, his surplus land and property must be taken over. If they resist, they will have committed a crime, and we will send them to the people's court for punishment.
    Once the land and property are taken over, we peasants will distribute them fairly, one share for everyone. The land and property of the landlords will be taken completely, but they will also be given a share. The rich peasants will give up their surplus, but they will also be left with a share.
    After such an equal distribution, those who cultivate the land will all have land to cultivate, have food to eat, and their lives will be better.

    告诉你一个好消息，咱们翻透身的日子到了。土地法大纲规定的好：把地主的土地、财产都没收了，把富农多余的土地、财产拿过来，把村里的公地、庙里的地、祠堂里的地也拿出来；由咱们农民作主平均分，一人一份，这就可以翻透身了。前些年咱们闹翻身，翻的不透。有些地主老财家有人当了干部，他们包庇家庭，这些人斗的就不彻底。斗出来的东西也没分公道，有些干部拿的多，“大佃户”分的多，军人家属也分的多；这么一来咱们穷人就分的少了。
    如今按着土地法办事，这些毛病就改过来了。只要是地主，不管他家里有什么人，当了什么大干部；也不管他有什么硬腰把子；他的土地、财产都得没收干净。只要是富农，他多余的土地、财产就得拿过来。他们要抵抗，就犯了罪，咱们把他送到人民法庭惩治。
    土地、财产拿过来了，由咱们农民公平分配，人人一份。地主的土地、财产拿干净了，也给他分一份。富农把多余的拿出来，也给他留一份。
    这么平分以后，种庄稼的就都有地种，有饭吃，日子就好过了。
