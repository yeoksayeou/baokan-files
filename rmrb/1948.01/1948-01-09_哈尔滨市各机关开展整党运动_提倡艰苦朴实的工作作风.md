Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th. The Harbin municipal organs' streamlining movement has concluded after more than two months of democratic discussion and has now begun to transition into a party rectification movement. At the beginning of the streamlining, Comrade Li Fuchun of the Northeast Bureau made a mobilization report, pointing out that this streamlining is very different from the "streamlining administration and better troops" campaign during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Today, it is to win the victory of large-scale warfare, build a strong and powerful rear area, advocate a hardworking and simple work style, and extensively carry out the movement to save money to support the front. Subsequently, streamlining committees were established according to each system and unit, and democratic conferences were held, adopting a precise calculation method to examine the work of their own departments, and actively put forward opinions to other units. Then, the responsible comrades of each organ formulated a draft establishment plan, which was submitted to the Northeast Bureau for unified regulations. The regulations were issued by the Central Bureau a few days ago, mainly including the following: reduce overlapping layers, re-examine the original establishment of the unit, reduce unnecessary personnel, and advocate that one person do the work of several people. Except for the heads of the Northeast Bureau who are required to handle confidential documents and are allowed to have one secretary, no one else is allowed to have a personal secretary. Except for the heads stipulated by the Northeast Bureau, other cadres should not use bodyguards. Cadres using orderlies should uniformly change to five people sharing one orderly. Female comrades who participate in work at or above the regimental or county level with one or two children under the age of five can be assigned one nanny; those with three children under the age of five can add one orderly. Female comrades below the county and regimental level who participate in work with one child will share a nanny with another person; those who do not participate in work will not be equipped with a nanny if they have only one child, and those with two children under the age of five can be equipped with one nanny. Each system should establish kindergartens and nurseries under possible conditions to enable female cadres to participate in work and production. In terms of the living system, the supply standards should be strictly observed. The treatment of all cadres must be based on the living standards of middle peasants in the countryside and technical workers in the city, and must not exceed them. Regarding rooms and residences, except for the few top leaders decided by the Northeast Bureau, the rest should be merged with the organs, and no individual residences should be allowed. Unmarried individuals below the section chief level should live together, and all surplus houses should be returned to the public. Regarding transportation, except for a few leaders stipulated by the Northeast Bureau who can be equipped with a car due to work relations, other cadres can adopt a public long-term tram ticket system. All organs should cancel cigarette provisions for hospitality. Meetings and conversations should calculate time to avoid providing meals whenever possible. For entertainment, in addition to evening parties organized by organs and cultural troupes, each organ's personnel are only allowed to watch movies in an organized manner once every half month; those who watch movies at other times will be investigated and punished. The work and study system uniformly implements a ten-hour work and study system, with eight hours of work and two hours of study every day, and uniformly stipulates the time. Office work is also required on Sunday mornings, and discussion meetings can be held in the afternoon. Outgoing personnel must ask for leave, and no visitors are allowed during office hours without special reasons. In order to implement the above system, the Northeast Bureau specially convened a joint conference of all general branches, emphasizing that each branch should mobilize the entire party to make guarantees and conduct regular inspections and supervision. Now all organs have complied with the implementation, and at the same time are carrying out anti-corruption and launching a savings movement, gradually transitioning to the party rectification stage.
