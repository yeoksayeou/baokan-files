　　Shao Ming Coal Mine Ousts Landlords
  　Workers Unite, Production Increases
    [Our Dispatch] The Neiqiu Shao Ming Coal Mine ousted more than 40 speculative landlords last autumn. The workers' enthusiasm for production is greater than before. All the staff and workers of the mine are carrying out a winter production campaign, and everyone has set out the conditions for production increase competition. The factory also guarantees that all materials will be supplied in a timely manner without difficulty. In the past month, various tasks have been improved and enhanced. In terms of production increase: this autumn, one shift produced 20 cans of coal (each can weighing about 700 jin), which is about one can per three people. Before the campaign was launched, the output per worker was 462 jin, about half a can or more. After the campaign started (December), with the increase of new workers and difficult production conditions, the output per worker increased to 609 jin. Worker Hu Chunxi used to only be able to dig 60-70 "fen" (a unit of measurement) of the kiln, but now he can dig 1 meter 15. Cai Renao increased from 70-80 fen to 1 meter 25 - 1 meter 3, and also took time to help others pull carts. In the past, the cans were filled to 80%, but now each shift automatically has someone to check, and they are all filled very full. Meng Qingjian and Li Quanbao, workers who work underground, used to set up three or four supports per shift, but now they have doubled that and can set up eight, and they also chop their own pillars and haul the wood. Zhang Chunde, an old worker in the machine shop, used to make four picks per shift, but now he has increased that to ten. In terms of cherishing tools and saving raw materials: Ning Shunxi does not bring broken cart strips and cart frames to the kiln, but automatically repairs them underground. In order to reduce waste, he automatically pulls out the picks, coal blocks, and old wood from the recesses and fills them in again. Zhang Heiniu puts all his effort into taking care of the wood, so that it is not cut off carelessly. The number of damaged picks in the machine shop has been reduced compared to the past. The worker comrades also carefully study and research, and Zhang Lian'er created a "ku ba" (handle) for the picks, which can reduce the number of broken picks by 50 per shift per month. In terms of unity between new and old workers, class love is fully developed, which has greatly improved the skills of the new workers. Zhang Lian'er and Shi Jinxiang, old workers underground, said: "It's not enough for us to know how, we must also teach the comrades underground." Under their enthusiastic guidance, coal miners Du Zenglong and Bai Shulin learned how to work underground, and now they have become all-rounders underground, learning how to mine coal, pull carts, and set up supports. Yu Xinzheng, who had just been liberated from the Jingxing Mine, is now working with great enthusiasm after the patient help of the old comrades, and he can do both good and bad jobs. Yang Wenchang, a liberated worker from Jingxing, after realizing his ideological awareness, also told the newly arrived workers about the life of the workers in the liberated areas, inspiring everyone to work actively. Little workers Hou Suozi and Li Zengyun gave their willow hats to Yu Binghuai to wear, and gave their shoes to Huang Baoyu to wear, fully demonstrating class love. According to statistics, in one month, more than 100 new workers learned and improved their skills. At present, all the staff and workers of the factory have been involved in the upsurge of the great production movement, and are now working hard to complete the production of 12,000 tons of coal in the five months of winter and spring (December - April).

　　邵明煤矿挤掉地主
  　职工团结产量增加
    【本报消息】内邱邵明煤矿去年秋季挤出投机地主四十多人，工人闹生产劲头比以前更大了，全厂职工开展冬季大生产运动，大家并订出增产竞赛条件；厂方也提出保证一切材料及时供给不受困难。一月来各种工作上都有改进和提高。在增产方面：今年秋季一班出煤二十罐（每罐约七百多斤），约合三人一罐。发动运动前，每工产量为四百六十二斤，约合半罐多。运动开始后（十二月份），在新工人增多及生产条件困难的情况下，每工产量提高到六百零九斤。工人胡春喜原来只能刨六、七十分的窑，现在能刨到一米达一五。蔡热闹则由七○——八○分增到一米达二分五——一米达三，还抽出时间帮别人拉斗。过去装的是八成罐，现在各班自动有专人检查，都装的很满。窑下下棚工人孟清建、李全保过去每班下三四架，现在增加一倍能下到八架，并且还是自己打柱窑拉木头。机务处老工人张春德过去打镐每班打四张，现在提高到打十张。在爱护工具节省原料方面：宁顺喜把坏了的斗条斗架不往窑上弄，自动在窑下修理好。为了减少浪费，他并自动的把研于窝里的镐、炭块、旧木头拉出来再填实。张黑牛用尽心思来设法顾对木头，使不随便瞎截。机务处尖镐比过去减少了尖毁坏的数目。工人同志还精心钻研，张连二创造了镐的裤把（柄），这样每班一月可少坏五十根镐。在新老工人团结上，充分发扬阶级友爱，使得新工人技术大为提高。下棚老工人张连二、石金相说：“光咱会了不行，还要把窑下同志都教会。”在他俩热心指导下，刨煤工人杜增隆、白树林学会了下棚，现在成了窑下的全把式，刨煤、拉斗、下橱都学会了。刚从井陉矿解放来的于新忠，经老同志们耐心帮助，现在他干的很带劲，好坏道都行啦。井陉解放工人杨文昌思想觉悟后，还给新来的工人讲说解放区工人生活，启发大家积极工作。小工人侯锁子、李增云把自己戴的柳帽给了于兵怀戴，并且把鞋送给黄宝玉穿，充分显示出阶级热爱。据统计一月当中，有一百多新工人学会与提高了技术，目前全厂职工人员都已卷入大生产运动热潮里，现正为完成冬春五个月（十二月——四月）一万两千吨煤产量而努力。
