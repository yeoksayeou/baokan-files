Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Prague dispatch: The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party published a letter to all party members and organizations at all levels on the 10th. The letter announced: Preliminary steps towards socialism have been implemented, the economic power of the bourgeoisie has been overthrown, the material foundation of people's democracy has been established, the two-year plan is being successfully implemented, and wages are gradually rising. The letter pointed out: The Czechoslovak Communist Party is the most powerful party not only in the cities but also in the countryside, and it enjoys great prestige among the peasants. The letter continued: Last year, Czechoslovakia was subjected to strong pressure from foreign reactionaries and was refused dollar loans and threatened with economic boycotts. However, the government took resolute and appropriate action, refusing to participate in the Marshall Plan, which aimed to restore the Ruhr heavy industry and establish a bridgehead against democratic countries. The letter emphasized: The alliance with the Soviet Union is a strong guarantee of Czechoslovakia's security and sovereignty. According to the Czechoslovak Communist Party's newspaper, the Czechoslovak Communist Party's influence among the people is expanding further. In the upcoming general election, the Communist Party organization is developing rapidly in industrial areas. Last year, 20,000 people joined the party in the Karlovy Vary region. Among the miners of Kladno, 52 percent of the electors are party members. In many places, more than 40 percent of the electors are party members.
