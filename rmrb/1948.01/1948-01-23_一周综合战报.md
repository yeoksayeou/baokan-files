　　Weekly Comprehensive Battle Report
    Comprehensive battle report for the week of January 15th to 21st:
    Southern Front: On January 9th, the Tongbai Military Region's Liberation Army began besieging Deng County in southwestern Henan. By the morning of the 16th, they had completely annihilated eleven security regiments of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits within the city, totaling over 8,000 men. Deng County was a stronghold of reactionary landlord armed forces in southwestern Henan. When our army swept through the Funiu Mountains and advanced eastward to strike the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, the reactionary forces of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits from various counties successively fled to the Nanyang, Neixiang, and Deng County area, ultimately being captured by us. The victory at Deng County greatly benefited the liberation cause of the people of Henan. From then on, the reactionary local defense forces in Henan Province, regarded as treasures by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, were mostly annihilated. (Note: When the Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui Grand Army crossed the Longhai Railway to the south, they had already annihilated five regiments and one battalion out of the six security regiments of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits east of the Pinghan Railway in Henan Province. Since the Yu, Shaanxi, and Hubei Liberation Army crossed the river, they have annihilated all sixteen security regiments in Luoyang, Shan County, etc., and most of the thirteen security regiments in Luoning, Lushan, etc.).
    The armed forces of the newly liberated peasants are actively cooperating with the main forces in combat, and their strength is growing daily. In the forty days from December to early January, the local armed forces of Yu, Shaanxi, and Hubei fought in Xin'an, Yiyang, Luoning, Lushi, Yun County, Yunxi, Nanzhao, Nanyang, Fangcheng, Wuyang, and along the Longhai Railway in over ninety battles, successively annihilating over two thousand local Chiang Kai-shek troops. The masses also actively searched for and suppressed small groups of reactionary landlord armed forces, with the Sixth and Seventh Military Sub-districts alone seizing nearly seven thousand rifles and short guns from three counties. In the east, the local armed forces captured Linru for the third time. The local armed forces of E, Yu, and Wan cooperated with the field army in sweeping away local Chiang Kai-shek troops in Huangpi, Xincai, and other areas, capturing six strongholds including Liuzigang and Baoxinji from the 5th to the 9th, and destroying forty li of roads.
    In the past month, the Jianghan Military Region has established twelve democratic governments in Jingshan, Zhongxiang, Qianjiang, Tianmen, Jianli, Jingmen, Anlu, Yingcheng, Jiangling, Hongshan, Mianyang, and Sui County. Currently, the county governments are opening granaries to relieve poverty and helping peasants carry out land reform, enabling this fertile new area to take root quickly.
    To coordinate with the southern front operations, our Ji-Lu-Yu local corps uprooted the isolated stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in the inner line, Dongping City, again on the evening of the 6th to the morning of the 7th, annihilating over 1,300 enemy troops, including Zhang Cenxiu, deputy brigade commander of the 3rd Security Brigade. The local armed forces in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have achieved brilliant victories. In the nine months from March to December of last year, they fought 3,064 battles, annihilating 14,000 enemy troops, equivalent to one-fourth of the 60,000 enemy troops annihilated by the Northwest Field Army during the same period. In constant active combat, they have tripled their strength and cooperated with the field army to recover large areas, independently maintaining and establishing new democratic regimes in the four counties of Zhong (bu), Yi (jun), @yi, @xian, Sanyuan and the three districts of Chishui. Around the New Year, guerrilla warfare was extremely active throughout Shandong Province. In Lu Zhong alone, over 3,100 enemy troops were annihilated in December. In Jiaodong, Lunan, Binhai and other areas, over 1,000 enemy troops were annihilated within ten days.
    Northern Front, Northeast Battlefield: After our army annihilated three full divisions and one army headquarters of the enemy in Zhangwu and Gongzhutun, the isolated cities of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Shenyang, Changchun, and Jilin are increasingly trapped in a state of hunger and cold. On the 13th, our army again routed three regiments of the 96th Army and 60th Army of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, who had ventured out from Goubangzi, the connecting point of the Beining Line and Yingkou branch line, near Beizhen, northeast of Jinzhou, annihilating over 1,400 of them. The remnants fled in disarray. Prior to this, the Liberation Army had launched a sabotage campaign on the Goubangzi-Jinzhou section of the Beining Line from the 4th to the 7th of this month, completely annihilating the 200 or so enemy troops guarding the Shishan Station and other locations, and burning down the Guan Jia, Shishan, Yang Quan Zi and other stations. Another unit of our army entered the Jin(zhou)-Yi(xian) section, recovered the Yima Tuan Station, and annihilated over 170 bandits.
    Since the New Year, all commanders and fighters of the Liberation Army have devoted their greatest energy and time to studying Chairman Mao's report, mastering from it the correct direction guided by Chairman Mao to defeat the enemy. The field corps on the southern front, in the intervals between frequent marches and battles, seize the time, combine with combat, combine with land reform, and deeply examine their thinking and rectify their ranks. Each unit generally stipulates a period of three months and treats it as a combat task for study.

　　一周综合战报
    一月十五日至二十一日一周综合战报：
    南线方面：本月九日桐柏军区解放军开始围攻豫西南邓县，至十六日晨全歼城内蒋匪十一个保安团，计八千余人。邓县是豫西南反动地主武装的一个重心，当我军横扫伏牛山区及东进破击平汉南段时，各县蒋匪反动力量，相继奔避于南阳内乡邓县一带，终被我全部捕捉，邓县的胜利，大大有利于河南人民的解放事业。从此蒋匪视为珍宝的河南省反动团队，大部被歼。（按苏鲁豫皖大军南越陇海路时，已将蒋匪平汉路东之河南省六个保安团歼灭了五个团又一个营。豫陕鄂解放军渡河以来，已歼洛阳、陕县等十六个保安团全部，洛宁、鲁山等十三个保安团大部）。
    新区翻身农民武装，积极配合主力作战，力量日益强大。豫陕鄂地方武装十二月至一月上旬的四十天中，即在新安、宜阳、洛宁、卢氏、郧县、郧西、南召、南阳、方城、舞阳以及陇海沿线作战计九十余次，先后歼灭土蒋二千余人，群众并纷纷搜剿小股反动地主武装，仅六分区与七分区三个县即缴获长短枪近七千支。东面地方武装则第三次攻克临汝。鄂豫皖地方武装则配合野战军横扫黄陂、新蔡等区的土蒋，五日至九日即攻克柳子港、包信集等六个据点，破路四十里。
    江汉军区一个月来，已建立京山、钟祥、潜江、天门、监利、荆门、安陆、应城、江陵、洪山、沔阳、随县十二个民主政府。现各县政府正开仓济贫，并帮助农民进行土改，使这一片肥沃的新区迅速生根。
    配合南线作战，我冀鲁豫地方兵团于六日晚至七日晨再次拔除内线蒋匪孤立据点东平城，歼敌保三旅副旅长张岑秀以下一千三百余人。陕甘宁边区地方武装战绩辉煌，自去年三月至十二月的九个月中，作战三○六四次，歼敌一万四千人，等于西北野战兵团同时间内歼敌六万余人的四分之一，在不断的主动作战中，自己壮大了三倍，并配合野战兵团收复了大块地区，独力坚持与建立了中（部）、宜（君）、＠邑、＠县、三原四县及赤水的三个区等新区民主政权。新年前后，山东全境游击队异常活跃，仅鲁中在十二月即歼敌三千一百余名。胶东鲁南滨海等区旬日内歼敌千余名。
    北线方面东北战场：自我军于彰武、公主屯歼敌三个整师一个军部以后，蒋匪沈阳、长春与吉林等孤城愈陷入饥寒困绝的状态，我军又于十三日在锦州东北北镇附近击溃由北宁线及营口支线连接点沟帮子出犯的蒋匪九十六军、六十军等部共三个团，歼灭其一千四百余名，残敌狼狈遁回。先此，解放军曾于本月四日至七日于北宁线沟帮子至锦州段展开破击，将石山车站等守敌二百余人全部歼灭，并烧毁关家、石山、羊圈子等车站。我另部并进入锦（州）义（县）段，收复伊马团车站，歼匪百七十余名。
    新年以来，解放军全体指战员，均以最大的精力与时间投进了学习毛主席报告的热潮中，从中掌握毛主席所指导的正确的战胜敌人的方向，南线各野战兵团在频繁的行军与作战的间隙中，抓紧时间，结合战斗，结合土改，深入检查思想与整顿队伍，各部一般都规定以三个月时间并把它当作一个战斗任务来进行学习。
