One-Sided Emphasis on the Interests of the Poor and Hired Peasants
  　Should Check Whether Middle Peasants Are Satisfied
  　Please Provide a Public Response from the Tongtan Work Group
[Zuoquan News] At the summary meeting of the two-month winter production in Tongtan on January 15th, cadres discussed following the route of poor and hired peasants. Zhao Wanlu, chairman of the farmers' association, said: "When organizing winter production, we talked about patching holes, but we didn't know who had big holes and who had small holes, so we couldn't talk about solving the difficulties of the households with holes. We only saw that the entire village's livestock and labor were organized, very enthusiastic, and making a lot of money, but we didn't see the poor and hired peasants who didn't participate in the movement." Comrade Zhang Lianzhen, manager of the Sixth Brigade Mutual Aid Society, said: "This year's winter production must follow the line of the poor and hired peasants. Before, we didn't know who the poor and hired peasants were. Later, we heard Guo Shihe reflect on the street: Others have livestock and labor and can produce, but we don't have livestock or labor, how can we become rich? I only realized that the poor and hired peasants had difficulties, but it was already more than a month late." Li Farong, manager of the Farmers' Cooperative, said: "The credit cooperative supported transportation with 360,000 yuan, 300,000 yuan to new middle peasants, and 60,000 yuan to old middle peasants, but did not pay attention to the poor and hired peasants who had not been thoroughly turned over." During the discussion, everyone realized that the achievements of this year's winter production were not small, but the poorest of the poor and hired peasants did not get much. Finally, everyone decided: First, we must go deep into the poor and hired peasants, understand their difficulties, and overcome bureaucratic work styles; we cannot only listen to the reports of the team leaders. Second, organize the poor and hired peasants to do whatever they are good at; for example, the old man Zhang Xicai was originally asked to open a shop, but he could neither carry water nor make noodles. Later, we learned that he could peel hemp, so we gave him hemp to peel, earning 600 yuan a day, which he did with great enthusiasm. The old man Zhang Guixi could not do labor, but he could sell some goods, so the mutual aid society let him sell salt every time he went to the market. Third, let the poor and hired peasants do whatever is most profitable. In the past, some good deals were either done exclusively by the mutual aid society or were done by people with labor and skills. For example, the mutual aid society opened a shop, which was very profitable, but the money earned was distributed to others because the poor and hired peasants had few shares. The poor and hired peasants hauled coal every day, which took a lot of effort but earned little money. For example, Shen Heidan earned 20,000 yuan in more than forty days. Later, after calculation, the leakage could not make up for the hole, so he proposed to transform the shop, and earned 10,000 yuan in just half a month. Another example is sending vinegar from the vinegar shop to Xijing in Licheng, which cost 20 yuan per catty and was very profitable. It also included a meal, but the poor and hired peasants were not allowed to do it. Later, Qu Yinxi was allowed to do it, earning 1,600 yuan a day. After this discussion, everyone's thinking became clear and sober, and everyone said in unison: If the working class viewpoint is not clear, there is no way to do a good job. Now everyone is determined to go deep into the poor and hired peasants, listen to their opinions, and strive to serve them. (Tongtan Second Special Work Group, Tongtan Correspondent Group)

Editor's Note: The determination of the Tongtan village cadres to serve the poor and hired peasants is good, but the approach is not very good. It is easy to cause dissatisfaction among the middle peasants and isolate the poor and hired peasants by having the leadership solve the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants in isolation and letting the poor and hired peasants do all the beneficial things. Therefore, the best way is to let the poor and hired peasants rise up themselves, unite the middle peasants, and discuss production together. What are the reactions of the middle peasants to your approach? What are the reactions of the poor and hired peasants? We hope that you can check and give a public reply, so that we can get a correct conclusion on this issue.

　　片面强调贫雇利益
  　应检查中农是否满意
  　请桐滩工作组公开答复
    【左权消息】桐滩干部于一月十五日总结两月冬产会上，座谈走贫雇路线。农会主席赵万禄说：“组织冬季生产时说的是补窟窿，但不知道谁是深窟窿，谁是小窟窿，也就谈不上解决窟窿户的困难。只看到全村牲口劳力都组织了起来，很热烈，赚钱不少，对没参加运动的贫雇却没有看见。”六大队互助社经理张连珍同志说：“今年冬产要走贫雇路线，以前咱也不知道谁是贫雇，后来在街上听见郭世和反映：人家有牲口、有劳力能生产，咱没有牲口、劳力，怎能发家致富？我才知道贫雇有困难，但已误了一个多月。”农民合作社经理李发荣同志说：“信用社扶植运输贷出大洋三十六万元，新中农三十万元，旧中农六万元，而没有注意到未翻透身的贫雇。”在座谈中大家认识了今年冬季生产成绩不小，可是窟窿最大的贫雇，得的不多。最后大家决定：第一、要深入贫雇，了解他们困难，要克服官僚主义作风，不能光听小组长汇报。第二、贫雇会干啥就组织啥；如张喜才老汉原来让他去开店房，可是他既不能担水，又不能下面，后来了解他会拔麻皮，就给他揽麻，一天赚六百元，干的很有劲。张贵喜老汉劳动活不能作，可是他会卖些货，每逢赶集，互助社就让他去卖盐。第三、什么利最大，就让贫雇干，过去有些好买卖，不是互助社独干，就是让有劳力有本事的人干了，如互助社开了店房，很赚钱，可是赚下的钱，贫雇农入的股少，都给旁人分了。贫雇每天拉煤炭，出力大赚钱少。如申黑旦四十多天，赚得二万元，后来计算了一下，漏补不住窟窿，才提出改造店房，干了将够半月，就赚一万元。又如醋房往黎城西井送醋，一斤二十元，利很大，去了还管饭一顿，就没让贫雇去干，后来才让渠银喜干，一天可赚洋一千六百元。经过这次座谈，大家思想上明确了清醒了，一致说：什么工作阶级观点不明确，就没法子做好。现在大家决心深入贫雇，倾听贫雇意见，努力为贫雇服务。（桐滩二专工作组、桐滩通讯组）
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者意见：桐滩村干部为贫雇服务的决心是好的，但做法不大对，由领导上孤立的去解决贫雇困难，把有利的事情都让给贫雇做，这样很容易引起中农的不满，造成贫雇的孤立。因此最好的办法是让贫雇自己起来，团结中农，大家一块儿商量着搞生产。你们的作法中农有啥反映？贫雇有啥反映？望能检查后公开答复，这样我们对这一问题就能得到一个正确的结论。
