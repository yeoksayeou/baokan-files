Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, January 17th: A spokesperson for the People's Liberation Army Command here recently issued the following statement regarding the operational history and the evolution of the battle situation in East China over the past year:

In 1947, the military and civilians of East China crushed Chiang Kai-shek's "key offensive," which concentrated half of the total front-line forces, and in the second half of the year began to shift from interior defense to exterior counter-offensive, liberating vast areas of Su-Lu-Yu-Wan.

At the end of 1946, our army shattered Chiang's dream of "solving the Jiangsu-Northern problem in three months," achieving seven victories in seven battles in Central Jiangsu. In the Su-Bei Campaign in December, the enemy's 69th Reorganized Division was wiped out and the 11th Reorganized Division was dealt a heavy blow. From January 2nd to 4th of last year, in the area between Xiangcheng and Lanling in southern Shandong, the enemy's 26th Reorganized Division and the 1st Rapid Column were completely annihilated in forty hours. Taking advantage of the victory, Yizao was captured successively on January 10th and 19th, and the enemy's 51st Reorganized Division was completely annihilated. The great victory in the Lu-Nan Campaign, coupled with victories in other battlefields, forced Chiang to abandon his strategy of a full-scale offensive against the Liberated Areas and adopt the so-called "key offensive."

In early February, the Chiang bandits concentrated 28 brigades as the first-line force for the offensive in southern Shandong; at the same time, 11 brigades were concentrated in Jinan and 6 brigades were concentrated in Qingdao and Weixian, launching a three-pronged offensive towards the Shandong hinterland, clamoring for a "Shandong battle." After the traitor Hao Pengju's defection, the Chiang bandits became even more elated. Our army dispatched a unit south to capture Hao alive and wiped out his two divisions. The Chiang bandits then assumed that the main force of our army was south of Linyi, unaware that our army had only left a small number of troops in the vicinity of Linyi to engage the enemy's main force, while the main force was marching north at full speed, encircling the Chiang bandit Li Xianzhou's corps which had advanced south along the Jiaoji Railway in the Xintai, Laiwu, and Tusikou line. From the evening of February 20th to the 23rd, after sixty hours of fierce fighting, the enemy's two divisions, seven brigades, and more than 50,000 troops were completely and cleanly annihilated. At the same time, our army in Jiaodong also wiped out more than 4,000 enemy troops from the Chiang bandit 8th Division who had invaded north from Weixian. As a result, the Chiang bandits, advancing from the north and south, paid the price of one route being annihilated and the other being routed, and obtained an empty city of Linyi.

By early April, the Chiang bandits had again gathered 600,000 to 700,000 troops. The Tang Enbo corps invaded north along the Lin-Meng Highway, the Ou Zhen corps invaded east along the Si(shui)-Fei(xian) Highway, and the Wang Jingjiu corps attempted to connect with the Chiang bandits besieged in Jinan from western Shandong. However, before long, our army captured Tai'an on April 26th, completely annihilating the enemy's 72nd Reorganized Division. At that time, Wang Jingjiu's main force was only a day's march from Tai'an but dared not reinforce, and watched as the non-direct troops were annihilated. At the same time, our left-wing corps annihilated the Chiang bandit's "Number One Regiment Under Heaven" between Qingtuo and Duozhuang, and severely damaged its main force, the 11th Reorganized Division, at the foot of Mount Meng. By early May, the Chiang bandits reorganized their ranks and advanced side by side towards the Yimeng Mountains. This was the peak of the Chiang bandits' "key offensive" against East China. With its 74th Reorganized Division, one of its five main forces, as the central assault corps, each with three reorganized divisions on its left and right wings. When the enemy's 74th Reorganized Division advanced south to Tanbu, our army suddenly penetrated the middle of the enemy's two wing corps. After fierce fighting from May 13th to 16th, the entire 74th Reorganized Division was annihilated at Menglianggu, and the Chiang bandits coming to aid from the north and south were routed. From then on, our army began to win the initiative in the East China battlefield.

After June 25th, although the Chiang bandits still mobilized its main force of ten divisions and more than 300,000 troops, advancing towards the Yilu Mountains on a battlefield of less than 50 kilometers, implementing a scorched-earth policy of mass burning and killing, our army counterattacked the flanks and rear of the Chiang bandits, liberating Feixian and vast areas of southern Shandong, and annihilating the 37th Brigade of the 59th Reorganized Division and another regiment. Our western line corps again captured Tai'an, Ningyang, and Dakou, threatening Xuzhou and cutting off the rear supply line of the Chiang bandits attacking the Yilu Mountains. Our central corps inflicted annihilating blows on the Chiang bandits in the Nanma and Linqu areas, with the 11th Reorganized Division and the 8th Reorganized Division suffering the heaviest losses. At this time, our western line corps cooperated with the crossing of the river counter-offensive of the Liu-Deng army, forcing the enemy to withdraw troops from the East China mountains to the west to reinforce, completely disrupting the enemy's deployment, and the Chiang bandits' "key offensive" against the East China battlefield fell into fragmentation.

On September 8th, our westward counter-offensive army annihilated the Chiang bandit's 57th Reorganized Division in Shatuji, western Shandong, and in late September, following the Liu-Deng army, crossed the Longhai Railway southward, liberating more than 20 cities in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, and expanding the new Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Liberated Area. By this time, the Chiang bandits' key offensive was completely ended, forcing the Chiang bandits to adopt a strategic defense. At that time, the Chiang bandits still maintained their local offensive on the Jiaodong battlefield, but since the end of September, our eastern line corps annihilated two and a half enemy brigades in Jiaohe and Yexian, and successively captured Zhucheng and Gaomi. Our army in Jiaodong also shifted to a counter-offensive. Our army, persisting behind the enemy in central China, also developed from guerrilla warfare into a powerful force attacking enemy towns. In the Battle of Yancheng on August 12th, a division of Hao's remnant forces was annihilated.

In early November, our army breached 400 li of the Xulan section of the Longhai Railway, annihilating more than 10,000 troops of the Chiang bandit's 7th Brigade of the 24th Provisional Division and other units. In mid-December, our army again cooperated with the Chen-Xie army to launch a thousand-li strategic breach on the Longhai and Pinghan Railways, and went south along the Pinghan Railway to cooperate in combat, annihilating the Chiang bandit's 5th Corps Headquarters and the 3rd Reorganized Division south of Xiping, and severely damaging the 20th Reorganized Division in Queshan. Another unit of our army liberated Dongming and Kaocheng. From December 13th to 30th, our army annihilated a total of more than 30,000 Chiang bandit troops. The Su-Lu-Yu-Wan and Yu-Shaan-E, E-Yu-Wan three major liberated areas are connected into one vast area, and the three major liberation armies joined forces in the Central Plains, forming an unprecedentedly powerful force.

Our eastern line corps captured Laiyang and Haiyang in November, annihilating more than 10,000 enemy troops, and in December, defeated eight enemy brigades that re-invaded Laiyang, annihilating more than 8,000 enemy troops. After the Chiang bandits successively dispatched its four reorganized divisions, the 9th, 25th, 28th, and 54th, the Chiang bandits could only hold on to a corner of Qingdao, Yantai, and Longkou. Most of the towns and cities returned to our hands, and the situation in Jiaodong fundamentally changed.

After annihilating 9,000 Chiang bandit troops in early December, our army in central China again annihilated the enemy's "Encirclement and Suppression Column," the 51st Reorganized Division (rebuilt), and other units totaling more than 7,000 troops between Ye(ting)nan and Wuyou. By this time, our army, persisting behind the enemy, also seized the strategic initiative.

Our strategic situation today is extremely favorable, completely different from last year when we were under the "key offensive" of the Chiang bandits' 600,000 to 700,000 troops. This power to turn the tide is the result of the wise strategic guidance of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the brilliant command of Chief Commanders Chen and Su, the strong cooperation of the liberated areas, and the heroic, tenacious, fearless, selfless, tireless, and continuous struggle of our military and civilians in East China. Based on the victories we have achieved in 1947, with continued efforts in the future, we firmly believe that in the subsequent cooperation with powerful brotherly corps, we will certainly annihilate more enemies and win the final victory.

　　粉碎蒋匪七十万人“重点进攻”
  　我军转入反攻解放广大新区
    华东解放军发言人谈一年战局
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线十七日电】此间人民解放军司令部发言人顷就华东一年来作战经过及战局演变发表谈话如下：
    一九四七年一年中，华东军民粉碎了蒋介石集中第一线总兵力一半的“重点进攻”，并在下半年开始由内线防御转入外线反攻，解放了苏鲁豫皖广大地区。
    一九四六年底，我军打破了蒋贼“三个月解决苏北问题”的迷梦。在苏中七战七捷。十二月宿北战役，又歼灭蒋匪整六十九师及予整十一师以痛击。再于去年一月二日至四日在鲁南向城及兰陵间四十小时内全歼蒋匪整二十六师及第一快速纵队。乘胜于一月十日十九日先后攻克峄枣，全歼蒋匪整五十一师。鲁南战役的大捷，配合其他战场的胜利，就使蒋匪不得不放弃了对解放区全面进攻的战略而采取所谓“重点进攻”。
    二月初蒋匪集中了二十八个旅作为进攻鲁南的第一线兵力；同时并由济南集中了十一个旅，由青岛潍县集中了六个旅，分三路向山东腹地进攻，叫嚣“山东会战”。在郝逆鹏举叛变后，蒋贼更得意忘形，我军当以一部南下生擒郝逆，并歼其两个师，蒋匪乃以为我军主力在临沂以南，不知我军仅留少数部队在临沂近郊与敌主力周旋，而主力则兼程北上，合围由胶济线南下的蒋匪李仙洲兵团于新泰、莱芜、吐丝口一线。自二月二十日晚至二十三日经六十小时的激战，全部干脆歼灭了敌两个师七个旅五万余众。同时胶东我军也歼灭由潍县北犯的蒋匪第八师四千余人。于是南北对进的蒋匪，以一路被歼，一路被击溃的代价，摸得了一座临沂空城。
    至四月初，蒋匪又集结了六七十万兵力，汤恩伯兵团沿临蒙公路北犯，欧震兵团沿泗（水）费（县）东犯，王敬久兵团则自鲁西与困守济南的蒋匪沟通联系，然而为时不久，我军又于四月二十六日攻克泰安，全歼蒋匪整七十二师，当时王敬久主力距泰安不过一日行程而未敢增援，坐视非嫡系部队被歼。与此同时我左翼兵团于青驼、垛庄间歼灭了蒋匪的“天下第一团”，并重创其主力整十一师于蒙山之麓。到五月初旬，蒋匪重整阵营，向沂蒙山区齐头并进，这是蒋匪对华东“重点进攻”的最高峰。以其五大主力之一的整七十四师为中央突击兵团，各以三个整编师为其左右翼，当蒋匪整七十四师进到坦埠以南时，我军突然深入敌人两翼兵团之中间，经五月十三日至十六日的激战后，于孟良崮全部歼灭整七十四师，并击溃了南北来援的蒋匪。从此我军开始赢得了华东战场的主动权。
    其后六月二十五日起，蒋贼虽仍然调集其主力十个师三十余万之众，在不足五十公里正面的战场，向沂鲁山区前进，施行大烧大杀的毁灭政策，我军则反击蒋匪侧后，解放费县及鲁南广大地区，歼灭了整五十九师的三十七旅及另一个团。我西线兵团再克泰安、宁阳及大汶口，威胁徐（州）＠（州），切断了进攻沂鲁山区的蒋匪后方补给线，我中央兵团则在南麻、临朐地区予蒋匪以歼灭性打击，尤以整十一师、整八师损失最重。这时我西线兵团配合了刘邓大军的渡河反攻，迫使敌不得不自华东山区抽兵西援，完全打乱了敌人的部署，蒋匪对华东战场的“重点进攻”遂陷入支离破碎。
    九月八日我西进反攻大军，在鲁西沙土集歼灭蒋匪整五十七师，并于九月下旬继刘邓大军之后，越陇海路南下，解放了豫皖苏二十余城，扩大了苏鲁豫皖新解放区，至此彻底地结束了蒋匪的重点进攻，逼使蒋匪采取战略防御。当时蒋匪尚在胶东战场保持其局部的攻势，但自九月底，我东线兵团在胶河、掖县歼灭蒋匪两个半旅，续克诸城、高密，胶东我军也转入了反攻。坚持蒋后的华中我军也由游击战争发展为进攻敌人城镇的强大力量。八月十二日攻克盐城之役，歼郝逆残部一个师。
    十一月上旬我军破击陇海路徐兰段四百余里，歼蒋匪暂二十四师第七旅等部万余人。十二月中旬我军又协同陈谢大军对陇海、平汉两路展开千里的战略破击，并沿平汉路南下协同作战，歼蒋匪第五兵团司令部及整三师于西平以南，又在确山重创整二十师。我军另部则解放东明、考城。自十二月十三日至三十日，我军共歼蒋匪三万余人。苏鲁豫皖与豫陕鄂，鄂豫皖三大解放区在广大地区上联成一片，三大解放军会师中原，结成空前强大的劲旅。
    我东线兵团于十一月攻克莱阳、海阳歼敌万余，并于十二月间击溃再犯莱阳的蒋匪八个旅，歼敌八千余名，自蒋匪续调出其九、二十五、二十八及五十四等四个整编师后，蒋匪仅能困守青岛、烟台、龙口一隅，大部城镇重归我手，胶东形势根本改变。
    华中我军于十二月初歼蒋匪九千人后，又在叶（挺）南与伍佑间歼敌“进剿纵队”整五十一师（该师系重建）等部七千余人，至此，坚持蒋后的我军也夺得了战略的主动权。
    我们今天的战略形势极为有利，比起去年处在蒋匪六七十万人的“重点进攻”时，已经完全两样了。这种扭转乾坤的力量是毛主席、朱总司令英明的战略指导，是陈粟首长天才的指挥，是各解放区有力的配合，是我华东军民英勇顽强、不怕牺牲、不辞劳苦、不懈不休地连续奋斗的结果。我们在一九四七年已得的胜利的基础上，加以今后的继续努力，深信在此后与强大的兄弟兵团协同作战中，一定将更大的歼灭敌人，赢得最后的胜利。
