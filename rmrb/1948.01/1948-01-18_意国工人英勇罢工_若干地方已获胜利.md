　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Rome dispatch: The Italian working people are launching a more heroic struggle, and have achieved complete victory in some places. According to a TASS report on the 10th: Several thousand working people in Rome held a meeting to protest the closure of two steel factories in Rome and the illegal actions of the police in using tear gas to force workers to leave the factories. "Unità" pointed out: The closure of factories is a new offensive by the reactionary industrialists' association against the working class in Rome. To prevent the closure of other factories, workers at the Mannorini and Di Vianno factories went on strike and occupied the factories. The Gasperi government, intimidated by the power of the workers, was forced to fully accept the workers' demands, namely that wages be paid as usual during the workers' strike, and that the factory committee must be consulted before any worker is dismissed in the future. Factories that have already been closed will be reopened. Workers in the city of Pistoia (northern Italy) held a general strike and demonstration in support of textile, glass, and lead factory workers in the city who were protesting the factory owners' reduction of production. They also erected obstacles in the streets to prevent and resist police suppression. As a result, the workers also achieved complete victory, all demands were accepted, and the arrested workers were released. At the same time, 100,000 lire in compensation was obtained for workers injured by the blockade of the highway near Boniro. Strike struggles are still expanding in other parts of Italy. The Italian General Confederation of Labor (CGIL) called on 160,000 tax employees to strike on the 13th to support the 100,000 bank employees' general strike, which has lasted for 14 days. The fourth negotiation between the reactionary government and representatives of bank employees broke down because the reactionary government refused to make concessions. This strike "has become a new high tide in the nationwide labor movement, threatening the Italian economy" (Associated Press), paralyzing national finance and various business transactions. According to informal estimates by the Bankers Association, approximately 60 billion lire (US$102 million) worth of business is at a standstill. 1,600 dockworkers in Ancona (on the Adriatic Sea) occupied the shipyard because the capitalists refused to pay wages under the pretext of a lack of funds. Engineers, administrators, and workers jointly maintained operations, and order was good. Workers at the Monti factory in Civitavecchia (in the coastal province of Rome) went on a sit-down strike to protest wage cuts. The demonstrations by local garrisons in several major cities against the postponement of demobilization for soldiers of the 1925 class have been supported by the Italian Communist Party (PCI). The Sixth Congress of the PCI passed a resolution demanding the immediate demobilization of soldiers of the 1925 class. "Unità" revealed: "The parties currently in power in Italy are attempting to challenge the people on the eve of the election." The newspaper stressed: "Obviously, the police and the American army cannot achieve the goal of suppressing the people."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Rome dispatch: The strike wave in Italy continues to rise. At the call of the Italian General Confederation of Labor (CGIL), 160,000 employees of national tax authorities declared a general strike on the morning of the 12th to support the bank employees' strike. The CGIL secretariat held a meeting on the 13th to pay tribute to the 100,000 bank employees who had been fighting valiantly and continuously across the country for two weeks. The secretariat also reiterated its support for the bank employees' struggle. The strike wave has also spread to Naples, where 2,600 miners went on strike to demand improved working conditions and occupied several coal mines.

　　意国工人英勇罢工
  　若干地方已获胜利
    【新华社陕北十四日电】罗马讯：意大利劳动人民正展开更英勇的斗争，若干地方并已取得全部胜利。据塔斯社十日报导：罗马数千劳动人民曾举行大会，抗议罗马两个钢铁工厂关门、以及警察为了迫使工人离厂而施用催泪弹的非法行为。团结报指出：闭厂是反动的工业家联合会反对罗马工人阶级的新攻势。为了预防其他工厂的关门，曼诺里尼及狄维安诺诸厂工人举行罢工，并占领了工厂。加斯贝利政府慑于工人的声威，被迫完全接受工人的要求，即工人罢工期间工资照付，今后开除工人，必须经过工厂小组委员会的讨论。业已关门的工厂仍将开工。彼斯托亚（意北）城工人因声援该城纺织、玻璃和制铅工厂抗议厂主减低生产，曾举行总罢工及示威，并在街上堆起障碍物阻止并抵抗警察的镇压。结果，工人也获得全胜，一切要求已被接受，被捕工人已释放。同时对封锁波尼罗附近公路因而受伤的工人，已取得十万里拉的赔偿金。在意大利其它地方的罢工斗争，仍在扩大。意总工会号召十六万税务员工于十三日罢工，以支援已坚持十四天的十万银行雇员大罢工。反动政府与银行职工代表的第四次谈判，均因反动政府的拒绝让步而告破裂，这一罢工“成为波及全国的劳工运动新高潮，威胁着意大利经济”（美联社），使全国金融及各业交易陷入瘫痪状态。据银行业协会非正式的估计，约有价值六百亿里拉（一亿零二百万美元）的营业，陷于停顿中。安康纳（滨亚得里亚海）码头工人一千六百人，因资方借口缺款拒付工资而将船坞占领，工程师、管理员和工人共同维持工作，秩序良好。塞维塔维加（属罗马省滨海）孟蒂工厂工人因抗议降低工资而进行静坐罢工。为反对一九二五年级士兵延期复员而举行的若干大城市地方守备部队的示威，已得到意共的声援。意共六代大会曾通过决议，要求一九二五年级士兵立即复员。团结报揭露：“目前在意大利当权的各政党，企图在选举前夕向人民挑战”。该报力称：“显然，警察与美军决不能达到制压人民的目的。”
    【新华社陕北十六日电】罗马讯：意大利罢工浪潮继续高涨。在意总工会号召下，全国十六万税务机关雇员已于十二日晨宣布总罢工，以支持银行雇员的罢工。意总工会秘书处于十三日举行会议，向团结一致，在全国范围内进行了持续二周英勇斗争的十万银行雇员致敬，秘书处并再度表示支持银行雇员的斗争。工潮并波及那不勒斯，二千六百名矿工为要求改善劳动条件而进行罢工，并占领煤矿数处。
