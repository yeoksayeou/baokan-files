Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th—As the Lunar New Year approaches, prices in various Chiang-controlled areas are skyrocketing. According to various sources: In Shenyang, as of the 20th of last month, the price of rice had reached 3.5 million Chiang currency per shi (石, a unit of dry measure), more than double the price of rice in Shanghai; flour was 1.4 million per bag; and even sorghum cost 20,000 per jin (斤, a unit of weight). On the 23rd, starving masses stormed two Korean rice shops and completely looted the rice. Lower-level clerks and staff in Chiang's various agencies are also facing severe threats to their lives due to salaries far below prices. From the 20th to the 25th, seven clerks committed suicide due to living problems. Prices in Changchun are also rising daily, and poor students have no food or clothing. Some students are forced to become robbers. On the 17th, a cloth robbery case was cracked in Changchun, committed by one university student and four middle school students driven by hunger. Schools in Changchun have stopped issuing coal due to tight budgets. For example, at the Ninth Branch of the Northeast United Middle School, students are attending classes in the dormitories. More than 600 female students in the Sixth Branch of the United Middle School are taking classes in bed under their blankets. Teachers' salaries have also been unpaid for several months. Prices in Taiyuan, under the rule of the bandit Yan Xishan, continue to soar. Second-class flour had risen to 1.4 million by the 18th, millet was 18,000 per jin, and sorghum flour, which the majority of citizens rely on for food, jumped from 9,000 to 9,500 per jin in a few days. Cotton was 100,500 per jin, and coarse cloth sold for 40,000 to 50,000 per chi (尺, a unit of length). The average price index has reached more than 500,000 times pre-war levels, the highest in the country. In Shanghai and Nanjing, rice prices have risen even more sharply since the end of last month. Coupled with the severe cold weather, people are dying from hunger and cold. By the 21st of last month, more than 300 corpses had been found frozen to death on the streets of Shanghai. On the 20th alone, 64 corpses were found. In addition, in Dihua, Xinjiang, prices have fluctuated dramatically since the issuance of new 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 yuan notes on the 25th of last month. Prices in Xi'an and other places began to soar in the middle of last month. Cotton yarn rose by 6 million in two days, with each bale costing more than 32 million. Since the liberation of Shijiazhuang, prices in Beiping have soared, with the black market price of gold reaching 12 million per tael (两, a unit of weight). Local flour has also risen to 10,000 per jin, and a bowl of cabbage soup, which coolies and vendors eat, costs 1,600.
