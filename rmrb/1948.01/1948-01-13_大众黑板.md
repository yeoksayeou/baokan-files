　　People's Blackboard
    (For use by village blackboard newspapers, rooftop broadcasts, reading groups, and staff).
    On the thirtieth day of the eleventh lunar month, the Border Region Government issued a decree to punish corrupt cadres. This matter is very important. In the past, some cadres had old mindsets, learning the ways of Kuomintang officials and landlords acting like local bullies. Their minds were sharp, always looking for loopholes; their hands were long, grabbing public money and treating it as their own. Not to mention the distant past, just consider some of our village cadres. They didn't distribute the fruits of our struggle against landlords to us poor people, moving things back to their own homes and pocketing the money. When running cooperatives, they only asked us to invest, and after a year or so, there was no accounting. Even if there was, it was a muddled mess. No one knew if it was a profit or a loss, and everyone suspected something fishy, but no one dared to speak up. Even if they did, they'd be falsely accused, and there was no way to deal with it. Now, things are better. With this decree from the Border Region Government, no matter how big or small the cadre, civilian or military, if they are corrupt, we will not be lenient. We will follow the law and send them to the People's Court for trial. Those who are heavily corrupt (embezzling the equivalent of more than 7,000 catties of millet) will be executed, and those who are lightly corrupt (embezzling less than 100 catties of millet equivalent) will be dismissed and given demerits. All embezzled goods must be returned. This way, cadres who don't want to work for us and want to take advantage of us will not be able to get away with it. From now on, we will watch. If any cadre is corrupt, we will accuse them and send them to the People's Court to be judged for their crimes.

    （供乡村黑板报、屋顶广播、读报组、工作人员采用）。
    阴历十一月三十日，边区政府订下了个法令，要惩办贪污干部，这件事很要紧。过去有些干部，他们是旧脑筋，学国民党作官和老财当社首那一套，脑袋很尖，是有空就钻；手很长，抓到公家的钱财就是自家的。远的不说，光说咱们有些村干部，把咱斗争地主的果实，不分给咱穷人，东西搬回自己家、钱揣到自己腰包去了。办合作社，光叫入股，一年半载也不算个帐，就是算也是一笔糊涂帐，蚀本赚钱也没个底，明知里边有鬼，谁也不敢吭。就是吭了，反被人家倒打一扒，也没个法对付。以后好了，有了边府这个法令，不管他大小干部，文武干部，一有贪污，就不客气。按法令办事，送他到人民法庭去审判。重的（贪污合小米七千斤价以上的）要处死，轻的（贪污不到一百斤小米价的）要撤职记过，贪污的东西，都得拿出来。这样一来，想不给咱们办事、想占便宜的干部吃不开了。咱以后看看，不管哪个干部贪污了，咱就告他，送到人民法庭去判他的罪。
