Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Frontline, 12th: Frontline reporters Feng Mu and Wu Daxiang report: As soon as the battle to annihilate the Reorganized 3rd Division ended, Li Yingcai, the Chief of Staff of the Kuomintang's Fifth Army Corps who was captured first, was sent to the regiment headquarters of a certain regiment that was the main attacking force. He was short and stout, wearing a soldier's cotton hat. He had taken off his coat because he couldn't run, leaving only a set of thin clothes, and was draped in a tattered military blanket. He broke his foot when jumping off the city wall, and walked with a limp. When reporters asked about the details of the Reorganized 3rd Division's demise, he said: "This time, we were ordered by Gu Zhutong to march north at full speed to relieve the siege of Yancheng. When we reached Ershilipu, Xiping, and made contact with your army, we immediately realized the situation was serious. We immediately requested reinforcements from Zhengzhou, but the reply said that the 20th Division could not come, and that your army's main force had already moved south, and finally told us to 'handle the situation as appropriate.' We could neither advance nor retreat, so we had to shrink back into two villages to hold out for reinforcements. But as soon as we entered the villages, we found that we had already been surrounded by you on all sides. After being surrounded, the troops' panic, chaos, and weak combat effectiveness were extremely alarming. In the southeast of Zhuwangzhai, our defending soldiers were a Weihe brigade directly under our command. You only had about two thousand people, but as soon as the guns fired, an entire regiment of ours collapsed, leaving less than a hundred people to escape back to the village. When you attacked the 20th Brigade in Jingangsi, we sent a telegram asking them to close in, but before we even received a reply, the battle at Jingangsi was over, and only a few people retreated."

When reporters asked about the final breakthrough, Li Yingcai showed a look of mingled crying and laughing, saying: "Hearing that the 20th Brigade had been annihilated, and the 7th and 8th Regiments on the periphery of Zhuwangzhai had also been battered, we were even more panicked. Li Tiejun rushed over in a panic and told me to escape and gather near Suiping. As I was packing, there was artillery fire outside, and the streets suddenly became chaotic with people shouting and horses neighing. I didn't even have time to pack my things and followed them to the southeast village wall. The officers and soldiers of the army corps headquarters and division headquarters were all scrambling to escape from the city. I held onto a horse's tail and squeezed down the city wall. Above, there were also people pushing horses, crying and screaming. They pushed me down, and I ran to the east village wall. The east was filled with shouts of killing. I ran to the west village wall, and the west was under heavy fire. There was no way, so I had to run back to the southeast. Seeing the more than two-zhang-high village wall, my legs were already shaking. As I was hesitating, I was pushed off the village wall by the people behind me, and my foot was injured as a result. Two guards helped me, but we couldn't walk half a li before the charge sounded from all directions, and I was captured at that time."

When talking about the reasons for the Reorganized 3rd Division's demise, Li Yingcai pointed out: "First, the Chiang bandit headquarters' entire strategic policy was unclear and completely passive. Second, the middle-level commanders were constantly scheming against each other and holding each other back, causing the lower levels to be passively beaten. Third, your army's strategic policy is clear and your tactics are brilliant. We were extremely tired from traveling all day long. If we were a little slow, Zhengzhou would send telegrams, either scolding us or resorting to military law. I rode a horse all day, but I even fainted on horseback at Songshuping, Nanzhao. The fatigue of the lower-level officers is even more unimaginable. This time, when we arrived at Xiping, we were already hoarse and exhausted, and we were finished as soon as we made contact."

Li Yingcai is from Hunan and graduated from the fourth class of Whampoa Military Academy. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as the Chief of Staff of the 87th Division and the Chief of Staff of the New 12th Army. He was assigned to the Reorganized 3rd Division after it was first annihilated at Dayang Lake, first as the Chief of the General Staff and then promoted to Major General Chief of Staff. He is now forty years old. According to his own account, he has been a Major General for thirteen years.

　　“一和人民解放军接触我们就整团的垮了”
    蒋军第五兵团参谋长自供
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十二日电】前线记者冯牧、吴答祥报导：歼灭整三师的战斗刚一结束，首先被俘的蒋军第五兵团参谋长李英才就被送到担任主攻的某团团部来。他身体矮胖，戴着一顶士兵棉帽，衣服因为跑不动脱掉了，只剩一套单衣裤，身上披着一条破军毯，他在跳城墙时跌破了脚，走起来一跛一跛的。记者问起这次整三师覆没的经过，他说：“这次是奉顾祝同命令兼程北上解郾城之围的。当我们走到西平二十里铺和贵军刚一接触就发现情况严重，立刻向郑州求援，但是来电却说二十师不能来，又说贵军主力业已南下，最后叫我们“酌情处理”，我们既进不得又退不得，只好缩到两个寨子里据守待援。但是一进到寨子里，就发现已经被你们四面包围了。被包围后部队的恐慌混乱和战斗力的低弱是非常惊人的。在祝王砦东南我们的守兵是一个围和旅直，你们不过两千人，但是枪刚一响，我们的一个整团就垮了，只剩下不足一百人逃过寨来，你们进攻金刚寺的二十旅时，我们去电要他们靠拢，但是还没等到回电，金刚寺已经解决战斗，退回的只有几个人。
    当记者问起最后突围的情形，李英才显出一幅哭笑不得的神情说：听到二十旅被歼，祝王砦外围的七团、八团也被打得七零八落，我们就更恐慌了。李铁军慌慌张张的跑来叫我逃出后到遂平附近集合，我正收拾东西时，外面炮响了，街上忽然人喊马叫，乱做一团，我东西也来不及收拾就随着他们向东南寨墙跑去。兵团部和师部的官兵都争先恐后的从城上逃下去。我拉着马尾巴挤下了城头，上面也是人挤马跳，哭喊连天。把我挤了下来，我又跑到东寨墙，东面是一片喊杀声，跑到西寨墙，西面炮火正密，没办法只得又跑到东南面，看到两丈多高的塞墙，脚已经发抖了，正犹豫时就被后面的人挤推下寨墙，脚因此跌伤了。两个卫士扶着我走不了半里路，四面都响起冲锋号，我也在这时被俘虏了。
    谈到整三师覆没的原因时，李英才指出：第一、蒋匪统帅部整个战略方针不明确，完全被动。第二、中层各派指挥员处处钩心斗角，互相牵制，致使下面被动挨打。第三、贵军的战略方针明确，战卫高妙。我们终日赶路异常疲劳。稍一慢些，郑州就来电报，不是申斥就是军法从事。我终日骑马，但到南召松树坪时也在马上晕了过去，下级军官的疲惫更不可想象了。这次到了西平已经声嘶力竭，才一接触就完蛋了。
    李英才是湖南人，黄埔四期毕业，抗战中曾任八十七师参谋长，新十二军参谋长等职。整三师第一次被歼于大杨湖后到职，先仟参谋处长后提升为少将参谋长，现年四十岁，据他自谈，任少将已十三年。
