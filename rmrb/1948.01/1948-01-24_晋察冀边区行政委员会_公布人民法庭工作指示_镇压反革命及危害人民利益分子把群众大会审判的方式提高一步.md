Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 21st: The Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee issued the "Instructions on the Work of the People's Tribunals" on the 6th, and notified governments at all levels to establish county-level People's Tribunals rapidly in counties where land reform has begun, in accordance with these instructions. The instructions stated: (1) The People's Tribunal should be a tool for the people to suppress counter-revolutionaries and all elements endangering the people's interests, and an organizational form that takes the form of mass meeting trials and executions of criminals to the next level. During the current land reform period, the People's Tribunal should protect the peasants and resolutely punish all criminals who violate or undermine the Land Law and infringe upon the democratic rights of the people, according to the demands and opinions of the people. Any tolerance and liberalism towards these criminals is wrong. At the same time, the prosecution, trial, and judgment of the People's Tribunal must be realistic, distinguish right from wrong, and any hasty, reckless, emotional, and subjective actions are wrong. (2) In order to make itself an effective revolutionary weapon in the hands of the people, the People's Tribunal must follow the mass line in its work. It must go to the masses to collect the facts and evidence of the defendant's crimes, as well as the masses' demands for the defendant's punishment, conduct investigations and research, verify the evidence, and listen to the defendant's defense. After clarifying the facts, a judgment should be made. The judgment should be announced after being discussed by the masses. At the same time, the work must be done quickly to meet the demands and emotions of the masses. The People's Tribunal should have a principled distinction between the conviction of landlords and rich peasants and the conviction of workers and peasants; the former should be severely punished, and the latter should be leniently punished. (3) Regarding the organization of the People's Tribunal, there is currently no experience. We propose that the county establish a People's Tribunal, handle cases by district, conduct circuit trials, or hold trials in villages. In short, it should be convenient for the masses and meet the requirements of the masses' revolutionary struggle, and there should be no bureaucracy. Each county may appoint five, six, seven, or eight judges (depending on the number of districts) from the county government. Each district will then elect two to four judges from the peasant representative conference (or elected by the district peasant association and approved by the district peasant representative conference), and organize the county People's Tribunal Trial Committee by district (which may be prefixed with the order of the district), and mutually elect a chief judge in each district to preside over the trial, hold meetings, and accumulate experience. Judges should be selected from those who have a firm stance, are not afraid of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, are careful and steady in their work, and are supported by the masses. The county party and government leaders must strengthen their leadership over the People's Tribunal, and the judgment of important criminals must be approved by the county head before execution. Criminals sentenced to death must be executed only after the county head's approval. However, if the criminal is not satisfied with the judgment of the county People's Tribunal, he may request a retrial and may appeal to the commissioner's office. All those who have filed an appeal must wait for the final judgment of the commissioner's office before they can be executed according to law. (4) The work of the People's Tribunal can be roughly divided into the following four steps: (A) Inspection work: Inspectors elected by peasant organizations or inspectors appointed by the government should convene mass accusation meetings in the village where the defendant committed the crime, collect the facts of the defendant's crime and witnesses and physical evidence, and conduct investigations and verification, organize and draft the indictment, and demand punishment of the defendant on behalf of the injured people. This indictment must be reviewed, revised, and passed by the peasant masses before being submitted to the People's Tribunal and orally prosecuted at the court hearing. This step is the most important. A well-written indictment can concentrate the demands of the masses, encourage the emotions of the masses, raise the awareness of the masses, and make it impossible for the criminal to quibble in the face of sufficient and reliable witnesses and physical evidence. (B) Trial work: After receiving the indictment, the People's Tribunal should promptly conduct a preliminary hearing. After all preparations are completed, the date and location of the hearing should be determined, notices should be issued, and the public can freely attend the hearing. With the permission of the judges, the attendees can also speak. The judges shall interrogate the defendant based on the indictment, examine the witnesses and physical evidence, and allow the defendant himself or the defendant's representative to defend himself and present rebuttal evidence. The judges shall study the accusations and defenses and evidence presented by the plaintiff and the defendant, and then determine whether the charges are established. If the evidence is insufficient to constitute a crime, more investigations should be conducted among the masses to collect materials, clarify the facts, and try again next time or declare innocence. This step is to clarify the facts and ensure the truth of the charges. The judges should be realistic, calm, and not afraid to trouble themselves to distinguish right from wrong. (C) Judgment work: After the second step is completed, the trial committee should be convened to formulate the judgment. Before the sentencing, it is necessary to consult with the relevant masses to solicit their opinions. If the masses have any questions, they should be explained to them clearly. If the masses raise objections and have new materials, if the opinions of the masses are correct, they should be accepted, and the court should be reopened for trial, and the committee will revise the original judgment. If the opinions of the masses are incorrect, they should also be explained to them well until they are explained clearly and the masses agree, and then the court should be opened for sentencing. This step is the work from the proposed judgment to the sentencing. It is very important to solicit the consent of the masses and explain to the masses at this time. This can make the work of the People's Tribunal meet the requirements of the masses, and can also educate the masses and raise the awareness of the masses. (D) Execution work: After the sentencing, the judgment should be executed. The fines should be executed by the People's Tribunal and handed over to the village peasant organizations for handling. Those who are sentenced to imprisonment for two or three years or less can generally be handed over to the village for forced labor, but do not give the criminals physical abuse. Criminals sentenced to more than two or three years of imprisonment can generally be handed over to the county prisons (or renamed labor reformatories) to perform forced labor. The prisons run by the administrative offices can also transfer some prisoners for centralized management and use (repairing rivers and roads, etc.). The management and work of the prisons should be rectified and improved, and experience should be accumulated. The death penalty should be carried out by shooting, executed by the People's Tribunal. We believe that it is better to hand over most of the prisoners sentenced to imprisonment to the village for execution, which can adjust the labor force of the masses and reduce the government's management difficulties. (5) The People's Tribunal is absolutely not allowed to use torture to extract confessions or engage in malpractice. The organs and corresponding people's representative conferences that appoint or elect judges may reward, punish, adjust, or replace them at any time according to the work situation of each judge. If there are serious circumstances of favoritism, malpractice, and dereliction of duty, they should be handed over to the People's Tribunal for trial. During the land reform period, village peasant organizations may arrest current offenders who violate the Land Law, but they must promptly report to the People's Tribunal and hand them over to the People's Tribunal for handling, and they must not be detained for a long time. (6) Regarding the work of the People's Tribunal, there is still a lack of experience, so we must let the People's Tribunal do it boldly, create experience, and accumulate experience. We hope that all localities will report their experience in this regard to us at any time.

　　晋察冀边区行政委员会
  　公布人民法庭工作指示
  　镇压反革命及危害人民利益分子把群众大会审判的方式提高一步
    【新华社晋察冀二十一日电】晋察冀边区行政委员会于六日颁发“关于人民法庭工作的指示”，并通知各级政府依据是项指示，于已开始进行土地改革的县份迅速成立县人民法庭。指示称：（一）人民法庭应该是人民镇压反革命及一切危害人民利益分子的工具，是把群众大会审判处决罪犯的形式提高一步的组织形式。在目前土地改革期间，人民法庭应该保卫农民，对于一切违抗或破坏土地法及侵犯人民民主权利的罪犯，必须根据人民群众的要求和意见，坚决予以处分，任何对于这些罪犯的纵容和自由主义都是错误的。同时，人民法庭的起诉、审讯与判决，必须实事求是，明辨是非，任何草率鲁莽及感情用事和主观主义都是错误的。（二）人民法庭为要使自己成为人民手中有效的革命武器，必须遵照群众路线去进行工作，必须到群众中去搜集被告的犯罪事实与证据，及群众对被告处分的要求，加以调查研究，对证及被告的声辩，把事实弄明确后，再行判决。判决经群众讨论后，再行宣布。同时，办事必须迅速，方能适合群众的要求和情绪。人民法庭对于地主、富农罪犯的判罪与工农罪犯的判罪应有原则的区别，前者应从重，后者应从轻。（三）关于人民法庭的组织，目前尚无经验，我们提议县设人民法庭，分区办事，巡回审判或到村就审。总之，要便利群众，要适合群众革命斗争的要求，而不要有任何官僚主义。各县可由县政府委派审判员五、六人或七、八人（按区之多少），各区再由农民代表会各选派（或由区农会选派，区农民代表会批准）审判员二至四人，分区组织县人民法庭审判委员会（可冠以区之次序），并在各区互选主任审判员一人，主持审判、开会，并蓄积经验。审判员应选择立场坚定，不怕镇压反革命，办事细心稳当，并为群众拥护者充任。县党、政负责人必须加强对人民法庭的领导，重要罪犯的判决须经县长批准然后执行，判决死刑之罪犯，必须经县长批准才能执行。但罪犯如对县人民法庭之判决不服可要求复审，并可向专员公署提出声辩，凡已提出声辩者必须等候专员公署最后判决，才能依法执行。（四）人民法庭的工作大体可分为以下四个步骤：（甲）检察工作：由农民团体推选之检察员，或由政府委派的检查员到被告犯罪所在村召开群众控诉会，搜集被告犯罪事实及证人、证物，并加以调查、对证，整理起草控诉书，代表受损害人民要求对被告人处刑。此项控诉书须经农民群众审查、修改通过后，然后递交人民法庭，并在开庭时口头起诉。这一步骤最关重要，起诉书作得好的，可以集中群众要求，鼓励群众情绪，提高群众觉悟，并在充分而确实的人证、物证之前使罪犯无法狡辩。（乙）审讯工作：人民法庭在接到控诉书后，应迅速进行预审。一切准备好了之后，即决定开庭日期、地点，发出通知，开庭时人民可自由旁听，经审判员的允许，旁听人并得发言。审判员根据起诉书审讯被告，审查人证、物证，并允许被告自己或被告的代表辩护，和提出反证。审判员根据原告、被告提出之控诉与辩护及证据加以研究，然后确定罪状是否成立。如证据不足不能构成犯罪者，要再到群众中去调查，搜集材料，弄明事实，下次再审或宣告无罪。这一步骤就是弄清事实，确实罪状的工作，审判人员要实事求是，头脑冷静，不怕麻烦的辨明是非。（丙）判决工作：第二步工作做好后，即召开审判委员会，拟定判决。宣判之前，要先与有关群众商量，征求群众意见，群众如有疑问，应向群众很好的解释清楚，群众如提出反对意见，并有新的材料，如群众的意见是正确的，就应接受群众意见，再开庭审判，委员会将原判加以修改。如果群众的意见不正确，也要很好的向群众解释，直至解释清楚，群众同意后，再开庭宣判。这一步就是从拟判到宣判的工作，在这时征求群众同意，并向群众解释是很重要的，这样可以使人民法庭的工作符合群众的要求，并可教育群众，提高群众的觉悟。（丁）执行工作：宣判之后，要按判决执行，罚款由人民法庭执行，交村农民团体处理。判二年或三年以下徒刑之人犯，一般可以交村罚劳役，但不要给罪犯以肉体上的虐待。判决超过二年或三年徒刑的人犯，一般可交县监所（或改称劳动感化院）执行强迫劳动，各行署所办之监所并可调一些犯人集中管理使用（修河修路等）。监所的管理和工作应加整顿和改善，并蓄积经验。死刑一律用枪决，由人民法庭执行。判决徒刑的人犯我们考虑大部交村执行要好，这样可以调剂群众的劳动力，并可以减少政府管理上的困难。（五）人民法庭绝对不准刑讯，不准舞弊。委派或选派审判人员之机关及相当的人民代表会，得按各审判人员之工作情形随时奖惩、调换。如有营私舞弊，违法失职情节重大者，应交付人民法庭审判。村农民团体在土地改革期间，对于违犯土地法之现行犯，得进行拘捕，但必须迅速报告人民法庭，并交人民法庭处理，不得长久关押。（六）关于人民法庭的工作，现在还缺乏经验，因此要放手让人民法庭去做，创造经验，蓄积经验，望各地随时把这方面的经验报告我们。
