　　My Landlord Standpoint on Family Issues
　　I was born into a feudal family of a small landlord cum commercial capitalist. During the Anti-Japanese War, my family was a landlord family with dual roles. I joined the revolution and the resistance against Japan as a family member of a revolutionary soldier, while my elder brother became a traitor and served as a family member of a traitor. In handling family issues, I failed to distinguish between loyalty and treachery, the lines were blurred, I planned for the exploitative life of the landlord family by placing care and liquidation on equal footing, demonstrating a serious landlord standpoint. After a year, three twists and turns, the family was finally dealt with.
　　After the May 4th Directive, I saw the news report about Chairman Yang of Jize offering his land, and I thought to myself: I'll also "offer land" to pretend to be "enlightened," and I might get praised, making a better impression on superiors, colleagues, and subordinates. But then I thought that my family only has forty-eight mu of land (before the war, we had over seventy mu of land, thirty-two rooms, a shoe shop, one-third share of a coal shop, two mules...) If I offer the land, the family's life will decline even further, so let's wait and see? This false "offering land" idea stemmed entirely from personal vanity.
　　When I attended the Propaganda and Liaison Conference of the Prefectural Committee and conveyed the spirit of the May 4th Directive, I had two big joys: one was that the elimination of feudalism rather than the weakening of feudalism resolved the contradictions in my work. The other was that according to the Nine Articles of Care, my family could avoid being struggled against, and offering land wouldn't matter much. Clearly, my acceptance of the Party's May 4th land policy was based on two standpoints: the first joy was based on the work standpoint, and the second joy was based on the landlord standpoint.
　　My family was originally a landlord family with dual roles, and the County Committee had quite a difficult time dealing with my family. After the Japanese surrender, when the County Committee discussed how to deal with my family, they had a strong sense of embarrassment and helplessness. They thought it would be best to divide the family, only confiscating my brother's share and leaving mine untouched. They said this and then dropped the matter. Later, the Jinnan Administrative Office issued instructions on handling the property of traitors. The County Party Secretary heard the masses' reflections that not dealing with my family would have a bad impact on the masses, so he secretly discussed with the County Chief, thinking that it would still be best to divide the family, confiscating one share and taking care of one share. Then they called me to a meeting, where it was decided to divide the family into three shares, confiscating one share, and setting aside four mu of land from the confiscated share to take care of me. First, I was to go home to divide the family and get my parents to agree. But I didn't go back to divide the family for a long time. It wasn't until the land reform movement in 1946 that the County Committee decided to use the method of "one serving as two," taking out my brother's ten mu of land, considering it "confiscated" and also considered my father's "offering land." The Farmers' Association announced to the masses: confiscating my brother's ten mu of land, and using the remaining four mu of land and a residence as "care" for me.
　　My attitude towards handling the landlord family was not based on the masses. During the County Committee's discussion, I adopted the principle of "saying less and listening more, making up my mind internally." Because the comrades of the County Committee had good feelings towards me, wouldn't they take care of me? I was afraid that saying too much would be unfavorable to my family, and saying too little wouldn't be "enlightened." It was better for others to take care of me than for me to speak up myself. What decision was I making in my heart? I had already made careful plans: I decided to take out the living room, but I didn't say it, to see the County Committee's opinion. If the comrades' opinions exceeded this range, I would complain about the landlord family. If the comrades' opinions were smaller than this range, I would remain silent to express "enlightenment" and agree, showing my strong "Party spirit."
　　When it was being handled, I formally avoided it, but in my heart, I was already relieved because the County Committee had discussed it well. I was very satisfied with the handling result. First, I was satisfied with the "one serving as two" method; second, I was satisfied with the "care" for four mu of land and the "care" for a residence; third, my status as a family member of a revolutionary soldier was enhanced; fourth, my share in the family was enhanced, and my mother's attitude towards my wife improved; fifth, my family could join the Farmers' Association and even be distributed fruits according to the "middle peasant" standard. In fact, all of this was satisfaction representing the landlord's ideology.
　　Through the general meeting's study and self-criticism and the help of comrades, I began to realize that my mistake was: my attitude and decisions towards the landlord family took advantage of the impure elements within the Party, followed the wind, and evaded the historical trial of the landlord class. First, it took advantage of the County Committee's lack of principle and emotionalism. Holding the attitude that if you are emotional, then I will have a landlord standpoint. Second, it took advantage of the masses' lack of awareness (Note: it was not that the masses lacked awareness but that the County Committee and village Farmers' Association did not allow the masses to express their opinions), using the "one serving as two" method, deceiving the masses. It took back the four mu of land and house that should have been confiscated from my brother from the peasants and used them for "care" for me. This took advantage of the May 4th Directive's loophole of care to protect the landlord family. In the land reform, "the decisions I made" were not based on satisfying the peasants' land demands, but stood on the original class standpoint, delaying the division of the family, preserving and protecting the landlord family. It obstructed the masses' emancipation from within the Party.
　　The root cause of this erroneous thinking, after the help of comrades in the general meeting and group, was recognized as the landlord ideology brought from the original class, failing to draw a clear line with the family, not dividing the family from the landlord family, but dividing the family from the Party. This kind of thinking has a consistent historical root. I checked that when I was the Secretary of the District Committee in 1939, because the enemy swept through and took away a mule from my family, I used my familiar relationship with the branch Party members to mobilize money to buy back a mule to compensate for the family's losses, in order to maintain the exploitative life of the landlord family. I used my personal position to usurp the Party and serve the landlord family. (One of the reflections of the representative attending the Central Bureau Land Conference)

### 我对待家庭问题的地主立场

　　我对待家庭问题的地主立场
    我出身于小地主兼商业资本家的封建家庭。抗战期间我家是一身兼二任的地主家庭。我参加革命抗日是抗属，而我哥投敌当了汉奸又是奸属。我在处理家庭问题上是忠奸不分，界线不明，把照顾与清算平列，为地主家庭剥削生活打算，表现了严重的地主立场。经过一年时间，三次周折，最后家庭才得到处理。
    五四指示后，我看到报载鸡泽杨议长献田消息，心里想到：咱也“献田”装个“开明”，也可得到表扬，使上级、同级、下级间对我印象更好些。但又想到家里只有四十八亩地（战前有七十余亩地、三十二间房、鞋铺一座、炭店股三分之一、骡子两头………）献了田家中生活更会下降，还是等等再说吧？这种假“献田”思想，完全是由个人的虚荣心出发的。
    当我参加地委宣联会，传达五四指示精神后，心里有两大高兴：一大高兴是消灭封建而不是削弱封建，使工作中矛盾得到解决。另一高兴是按九条照顾办事，我家就可不被斗，献田就没啥。很明显的对党的五四土地政策的接受是两个立场；第一高兴站的是工作立场，第二高兴是站的地主立场。
    我家原是一身兼二任的地主家庭，县委会对我家庭处理颇费周折。日本投降后，县委讨论如何处理我家时，带有浓厚的不好意思与无可奈何的味道。认为最好是分家，只没收我哥的一份，不动我那一份。说过就放下了，以后冀南行署发下处理汉奸财产指示：县委书记听到下面群众反映，不处理我家对群众影响不好，就和县长背地讨论，认为还是分家，没收一份，照顾一份。接着又找我开了会，会上决定按三股分，没收一股，从没收中再留四亩地照顾我。先由我回家去分家和打通父母的思想。可是我很长时间没回去分家。直到一九四六年土地改革运动中，由县委决定用“以一当二”的办法，拿出我哥那十亩地，算“没收”，又算父亲“献田”。由农会向群众宣布：没收我哥的十亩地，并将其余四亩地及宅院一所作为“照顾”我。
    我对处理地主家庭所抱的态度不是从群众出发的。在县委会讨论时，我采取“少说多听，心里拿主意”的方针。因县委同志和我感情都不错，还能不照顾？自己说多了怕于家不利，少了又不“开明”，人家照顾我比自己说话强。心里拿的是什么主意呢？我早经过了周密的打算：决定把客厅房拿出来，但不说出来，看县委意见。如果同志们的意见超过这个范围，就代表地主家庭诉诉苦。如果同志们的意见比这范围还小，就不吭声表示“开明”同意，表现自己“党性”强。
    当处理时，我在形式上是回避的，其实心里已放心，因是县委讨论好了。对处理结果，我很觉满意。第一满意“一当二用”的办法；第二满意“照顾”了四亩地又“照顾”了一所宅院；第三满意抗属地位提高了；第四在家中我这一股地位提高了，母亲对我老婆态度抬高了；第五，家里可入农会，还按“中农”分了果实。其实这都是代表地主思想的满意。
    经过大会的学习检讨和同志帮助，使我开始认识自己的错误是：我对待地主家庭所抱态度和所拿的主意，是钻了党内不纯的空子，看风使舵，逃避对于地主阶级的历史审判。首先是钻了县委会原则性不强、感情用事的空子。抱着你有感情用事，我就有地主立场的态度。其次是利用了群众觉悟不高的空子（按：并非群众觉悟不高而是县委、村农会不让群众发表意见），以一当二，用欺骗的办法坑了群众。把我哥应没收的四亩地和房子也从农民手中夺回来“照顾”了我。这是利用了五四指示照顾的空子来包庇了地主家庭。在土地改革中“我所拿的主意”，不是从满足农民土地要求出发，而是站在原阶级立场，拖延分家，保留和包庇了地主家庭。从党内来阻碍了群众的翻身。
    形成这种错误思想的根源，经过大会与小组同志帮助，认识到是从原阶级带来的地主思想，和家庭没划清界限，不是和地主家庭分家，而是和党分了家。这种思想是有其一贯历史根源的。检查我一九三九年任区委书记时，因敌人扫荡，牵走我家一头骡子，曾利用我熟悉的支部党员关系，动员了钱买回一头骡子补偿家庭损失，以维持地主家庭剥削生活。利用个人地位来篡夺了党，为地主家庭服务。（参加中央局土地会议代表反省之一）
