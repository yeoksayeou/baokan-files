Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th -- Reports from all sides: A wave of labor unrest against the occupying authorities' starvation policies is sweeping through the British-occupied zone of Germany. Twelve thousand dockworkers in Hamburg announced a strike on the 6th, demanding higher wages, improved working conditions, and increased food rations. The strikers also occupied the port, preventing fifty ships carrying food and goods from unloading. The Hamburg Trade Union (mainly controlled by Social Democrats) ordered a return to work, but was rejected by the strikers. According to a communiqué issued on the 7th by the German Communist Party in the Western occupation zone: "This strike struggle by dockworkers has received the support of all the people of Hamburg." In the Ruhr area cities such as Düsseldorf, Duisburg, Essen, and Cologne, the strike is spreading. In Cologne, thousands of workers at the Westwaggon locomotive factory, ignoring the Social Democratic trade union's order to forcibly return to work, are continuing their strike. Ruhr miners are also fighting against anti-strike measures. Hundreds of workers at the Friedrich-Wilhelm steel factory in Mülheim, Rhine Province, also went on strike on the 3rd to protest the low food rations. The British Minister for Occupation Policy, Mr. Hynd, has flown from London to Cologne as a result, indicating the seriousness of the strike situation.

　　要求增加工资改善生活
  　德国英占区工人罢工
    【新华社陕北十一日电】各方讯：反对占领当局饥饿政策的工潮，正席卷德境英占领区。汉堡一万二千名码头工人于六日宣布罢工，要求增加工资，改善工作条件及提高粮食配给。罢工者并占领了港口，使载有粮食及货物的五十艘船只不能卸货。汉堡职工会（主要为社会民主党人把持）曾下令复工，但为罢工者所拒绝。据西部占领区德共在七日发表的公报：“码头工人这次罢工斗争已得到全体汉堡人民的支持。”在鲁尔区的杜塞尔多夫、杜伊斯堡、埃森、科隆等城市，罢工正在蔓延中。科隆的威斯特瓦岗斯的火车头工厂数千工人，不顾社会民主党职工会的强迫复工令，继续罢工。鲁尔矿工亦正在为反反罢工而斗争。莱茵省穆尔亥谟之佛力德利克·威廉钢铁工厂数百工人，亦于三日举行罢工，抗议太低的粮食配给。英占领政策部长白肯汉已为此自伦敦乘飞机赶抵科隆，可见罢工情势之严重。
