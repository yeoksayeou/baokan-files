[Ji Lu Yu News] The local armed forces of the Fifth Military Sub-district have persisted in the struggle in the area for the past year. In addition to crushing the Chiang bandit's successive "encirclement and suppression" and "mopping-up" operations, they have also coordinated with the main force's outward attacks, opening up new areas north of the Longhai Railway and helping the masses in the new areas to launch a movement to distribute grain and wealth, turning over a new leaf. In the past year, the local armed forces have fought a total of 439 battles, capturing 3,499 Chiang bandits, including Zhang Lanfeng, commander of the Third Column of the Chiang bandits, killing and wounding 2,342, seizing three mortars, 2,263 rifles and carbines, 151 pistols, 12 heavy machine guns, 72 light machine guns, 10 submachine guns, 102,781 rounds of ammunition, 336 shells of various types, 751 hand grenades, 67 war horses, two radio stations, nine telephones, 48,600 catties of wire, nine cars, more than 14,500 catties of grain, 63,054,000 yuan in Chiang currency, destroying 175 li of railway and six bridges.
