　　Gaoyi Cooperatives Fatten Landlords
  　Eat, Drink, and Do Bad Things

　　[Gaoyi News] Many cooperatives in Gaoyi were established with the fruits of struggle, but they are raising a group of landlords who eat and drink all day long and do no good, turning the cooperatives into "retirement homes" for landlords. The Houzhuangtou Cooperative was established with 100,000 yuan of the masses' gains. Landlord Xue Lao Huai was employed as a carpenter, provided with food and drink, and earned five dou of rice each month. The cooperatives made spinning wheels, looms, and waterwheel buckets, but were afraid that the poor peasants and hired laborers would not be able to pay their debts, so they did not sell them to them, but instead sold them on credit to middle peasants and above who had the means. The cooperatives' external debts could not be recovered, and internal consumption was high, leading to their collapse. The Nanqiu Village Cooperative (with 239,000 yuan in shares) had middle peasants as its chairman and accountant, and supported six landlords as cotton ginning workers. They were provided with food, and earned 1,000 yuan for ginning 100 jin of cotton. Nine people ate and drank every day, spending 165,000 yuan a month, plus 341,500 yuan for livestock feed and miscellaneous expenses over two months. The cooperative initially earned a gross profit of 410,000 yuan, but after deducting expenses, only earned 78,500 yuan. The chairman of the farmers' association reviewed and said: "Our village cooperative has become a 'retirement home' for the objects of struggle, and we have been serving the landlords for nothing." The Gu Cheng Cooperative, funded by the hard-earned shares of the masses, never distributed any dividends. Last year, the disaster was severe, and the masses urgently demanded the establishment of a charity granary to store bran and vegetables and organize production, but the cooperative was controlled by a landlord (secretary) who adopted a supportive attitude and ate and drank all day long. After inspection by the masses, the employed poor were extremely angry and dissatisfied, saying that the landlords were not their own people, so how could they do things for them? The masses decided to replace the chairman and secretary with emancipated peasants and earnestly help the masses solve the difficulties of transportation, production, and charcoal burning, and the masses' production began to flourish.

　　高邑合作社喂胖地主
  　大吃大喝办坏事
    【高邑消息】高邑有许多合作社是拿斗争果实办的，里面养活了一群地主，整天大吃二喝，不办好事，把合作社变成了地主的“养老宫”。后庄头合作社是拿十万元群众果实搞起来的。用地主薛老槐作木工，管他吃喝，每月还赚五斗米。合作社做的纺车织布机，水车斗子等，怕贫雇买了还不上帐，不卖给他们，却赊给中农以上的有法的户，合作社的外欠收不回来，社内消耗又大，弄垮了台。南邱村合作社（有股金二十三万九千元）社长会计都是中农，养活六个地主当轧花工人。管吃饭，轧一百斤花还赚一千元。每天九个人吃喝，一月花消十六万五千元，加上牲口草料杂支两月多消耗三十四万一千五百元。合作社一满赚毛利四十一万元，除了消耗只赚七万八千五百元，农会主席检讨说：“咱村合作社成了斗争对象的‘养老宫’，干了半天白给地主服务了。”古城合作社群众千辛万苦集的股金，常年分不到一点红利，去年灾荒严重，群众迫切要求成立义仓，集存糠菜，组织生产，但是合作社由地主（书记）掌权，抱着支应态度，整天大吃大喝。经过群众检查，雇贫非常激愤不满，说地主不是自己人，怎样会给咱们办事。群众决定把社长书记都改换成翻身农民，认真帮助群众解决运输生产烧炭困难，群众生产才开始红火起来。（书科）
