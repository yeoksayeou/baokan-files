Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th: Various regions in East China have overcome the devastation caused by Chiang Kai-shek's forces amidst the war and have universally launched winter production and savings-for-famine-preparedness campaigns, achieving significant results. According to statistics from ten counties in central Shandong, Chiang's bandits looted 14,000 head of livestock, and ten districts were robbed of over 21.8 million jin of grain. To address the winter production difficulties faced by disaster victims, the democratic government first issued large amounts of loans and organized mass production and savings campaigns. Simultaneously, it implemented strict streamlining, cleared out materials, and reduced expenditures to alleviate the people's burden. The central Shandong region has already received a total of 800 million yuan (Beihai currency) in loans and materials from the provincial government, the central Shandong Administrative Office, and the Industry and Commerce Bureau. In addition, a large amount of cotton was lent to develop the textile industry. In Jiaonan County of Jiaodong, in addition to loans of 40 million yuan, 110,000 jin of peanuts were used to support sideline industries such as oil pressing. The Binhai area also issued loans of 100 million yuan. In northern Jiangsu, Lian (shui) East County alone lent out 300,000 jin of wheat seeds. Regarding the resolution of labor shortages, the provincial government has decided to change the system of standing civilian laborers supporting the front to a system of short-term piecework supporting the front on the spot. A large number of civilian laborers who had accompanied the army on expeditions have been demobilized, with 100,000 returning home to production in the Bohai region. Many cadres from government offices and local troops have used significant manpower and livestock power to help the masses cultivate the land. In Yeting and Jianyang (newly established county) in northern Jiangsu, farmers collectively mobilized, and wherever the flags were planted, the wasteland was eliminated. In Yongdun Township, Funing East, over 8,000 mu of idle land in the entire township were cultivated in five days. In the border areas, armed forces provided cover for the masses to seize and cultivate land.

Regarding sideline production: Since its establishment two months ago, the Binhai Transportation and Marketing Headquarters has transported and sold an average of 600,000 jin of salt per day. The various stations have organized a total of 270 bullock carts and handcarts, and 553 pack donkeys. The masses have greatly profited from transportation. The 100 handcarts organized by the headquarters alone earned 7 million yuan by contracting to transport yellow tobacco for the Binhai Tobacco Company. Most transportation teams have managed to transport fish, salt, and brine outward and grain and raw materials inward, storing them for famine preparedness. It is estimated that Binhai can transport 20 million jin of salt this winter. Thanks to the strong assistance of cooperatives, most of the 400,000 spinning wheels and 23,000 looms in the Binhai region have been put into operation, with hundreds of thousands of female spinners engaged in winter textile production. In October alone, more than 25,000 bolts of cloth were produced. Textile production has also been universally launched in various parts of Bohai, with female spinners in three joint defense villages in Guangrao earning over 8 million yuan in half a month. In terms of savings, various government offices are strictly implementing the "Three Major Programs" (streamlining, savings, and clearing assets). Many government offices in central Shandong are even grinding their own grain. Post office staff saved salaries and grain, and the three counties of Mengshan, etc., contributed 8,000 jin of grain. Various localities have also universally prohibited the slaughter of draught cattle, the brewing of wine, and various wasteful phenomena. The East China Field Army's eastern front troops launched donation campaigns to help people in disaster areas restore production. A certain column donated 6 million yuan and some clothing, while the directly subordinate units donated 1 million yuan and 2,600 jin of grain. A certain regiment in Binhai also donated over 43,000 yuan, 1,800 jin of grain, and some clothing and bedding.

　　政府发贷款农副业一齐干
  　华东开展冬季生产
    【新华社华东二十四日电】华东各地在战争环境中战胜蒋灾，普遍开展冬季生产与节约备荒运动，成绩很大。鲁中十个县统计，就被蒋匪抢去牲口一万四千头，十个区就被抢去粮食二千一百八十余万斤。民主政府为解决灾民冬季生产困难，首先是发放大批贷款，组织群众生产节约运动，一面并厉行精简，清理物资，减缩开支，以减轻人民负担。鲁中区已由省府、鲁中行署和工商局发放贷款和物资共八亿元（北海币），另贷放大批棉花发展纺织。胶东胶（县）南县除贷款四千万元外，并以十一万斤花生扶助打油等副业。滨海亦发放一亿元贷款。苏北仅涟（水）东一县即贷出三十万斤麦种。对解决人力问题，省府已经决定将支前常备民工制改为就地支前的短工包工制，随军远征的民工已大批复员，渤海区就有十万人回家生产。有不少机关人员和地方部队，曾以大量人力、畜力帮助群众耕种。苏北叶挺和建阳（新设县）等地农民集体出动，旗子插到哪里，哪里的荒地就被消灭。阜（宁）东永墩乡五天中就耕完全乡八千多亩闲地。边沿区则由武装掩护群众抢耕。
    副业方面：滨海运销总站成立两月以来，平均每天运销食盐六十万斤，各站已组织起牛车、小车共二百七十辆、驮驴五五三头。群众在运输中获利很大，仅总站所组织的一百辆小车，给滨海烟草公司包运黄烟就获利七百万元。大部运输队都做到了向外运出鱼、盐、卤等类，向内运回粮食、原料等，储存储荒。预计滨海今冬可运出食盐两千万斤。由于合作社大力帮助，滨海全区四十万辆纺车、两万三千架织布机已大部开动，几十万纺妇投入冬季纺织，仅十月份即产布二万五千余匹。渤海各地也普遍开展了纺织，广饶三个联防村纺妇半月即获利八百余万元。在节约方面，各机关正厉行“三大方案”（精简、节约、清理资财）。鲁中不少机关更自磨粮食。邮局人员节约薪金、粮食，蒙山等三县即献粮八千多斤。各地并普遍禁杀耕牛、禁酿酒及各种浪费现象。华东解放军东线兵团各部掀起捐款运动，帮助遭蒋灾人民生产，某纵队捐款达六百万元，及衣服一部，直属队献金一百万元及粮食二千六百斤。滨海某团亦捐助四万三千余元、粮食一千八百余斤，及衣被一部。
