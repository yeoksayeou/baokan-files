　　Launching a Movement to Protect Land and Homes During the Anti-"Suppression Campaign"
  　Thousands Enlist in the Army in a Certain County in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Region
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hubei-Henan-Anhui Front, 26th] The people's armed forces in a certain county of the military region have launched a mass movement to protect land, lives, and hometowns during the anti-"suppression campaign." Since the convening of the county's peasant representative congress, the county's grand detachment has expanded by more than 400 people, and the district task forces are also expanding daily. The number of people enlisting in the army throughout the county has now reached over a thousand. In the struggle against the "suppression campaign," the people's armed forces have continuously achieved victories. A certain district task force fought against the Chiang bandits seven times, and in conjunction with the militia, attacked Chiang bandit strongholds, launching guerrilla warfare everywhere, making it impossible for the enemy to gain a foothold. A certain district task force fought seven times in three days, and two squads repelled two platoons of Chiang bandits.
