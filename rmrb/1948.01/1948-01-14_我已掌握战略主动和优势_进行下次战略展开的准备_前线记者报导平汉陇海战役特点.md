Xinhua News Agency, Su Lu Yu Wan Frontline, 12th: A frontline reporter reports on the characteristics of the Pinghan-Longhai Campaign, saying:

(1) The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has won an unprecedented strategic victory, manifested in the meeting and coordinated operations of the Yu-Shaan-E, E-Yu-Wan, and Su-Lu-Yu-Wan PLA forces in vast areas. The PLA has completely mastered the strategic initiative and advantage, opening up a mobile operational battlefield spanning over a thousand miles. This has rapidly expanded the borders of the newly liberated areas to the heartland of the Chiang bandits. This plays a very significant role in crushing Chiang Kai-shek's "key defenses" and accelerating the completion of the PLA's preparations for the next strategic deployment. In this campaign, the PLA cut off the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, a major artery of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, and once again attacked the Longhai Railway, isolating and surrounding Kaifeng, the provincial capital of Henan. This not only seriously threatened Zhengzhou, the strategic command center, but also seized important towns such as Xuchang, Luohe, and Zhumadian, Chiang Kai-shek's troop deployment bases between Zhengzhou and Xinyang, eliminating tens of thousands of Chiang Kai-shek's active forces and disrupting the entire deployment of the Chiang Kai-shek army in the Central Plains. In particular, the Fifth Corps, since its headquarters and the entire 3rd Division were annihilated, and the 20th Division suffered a devastating blow, the entire corps has largely lost its combat effectiveness. Chiang Kai-shek's main force, the 5th Division, ran around in panic, suffering heavy losses of several thousand men. This forced Qiu Qingquan to dare not reinforce Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, dragging his exhausted troops around the Hao (County), Lu (Yi), Huai (Yang), and Tai (Kang) areas. Seeing the urgency of the situation, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to draw troops from the "key defense" forces in the Dabie Mountains at the end of December, including the 9th, 10th, and 11th Divisions, to rescue the Pinghan Railway. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "hollow tactics" have completely failed. Due to the destruction of the Pinghan and Longhai Railways, and the isolation of large cities such as Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, Chiang Kai-shek will have to allocate mobile forces to defend these cities in the future, thus further dispersing and weakening his forces, making it easier for the PLA to annihilate the enemy one by one.

(2) Chiang Kai-shek's insufficient troops and the army's war-weariness have reached a more serious stage. Before this campaign, almost all the forces guarding the Pinghan and Longhai Railways were the remnants of the annihilated troops and puppet miscellaneous security teams, with few main forces. The 115th Regiment of the 39th Brigade of the 40th Division guarding Xuchang, and the 355th Regiment of the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division guarding Lanfeng, were all annihilated three times. The 3rd Division and part of the Independent 26th Brigade were also annihilated twice. Although they had been replenished after being annihilated, they still lacked manpower and weapons. For example, the new recruits of the 355th Regiment had no guns and were just learning to march. The artillery unit of the Independent 26th Brigade had soldiers but no guns, and the heavy weapons battalion of the 1st Cavalry Brigade had guns but no soldiers, which was an empty establishment. Many of the officers and soldiers in these troops had been captured alive by the PLA and then released. They were unwilling to die for Chiang Kai-shek in their hearts, so their combat effectiveness was very weak, and most of them collapsed at the first touch, or surrendered after a slight attack. Many Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, after being surrounded, laid down their weapons in squads, platoons, and companies in an organized and prepared manner. Even Chen De＠, the commander of the 8th Regiment of the 3rd Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line 3rd Division, personally led all the officers and soldiers of the regiment to surrender on the Xiping front. Some soldiers of the 355th Regiment, upon hearing the sound of gunfire, prepared white flags for surrender and hid them on their bodies. Among the weapons captured by the PLA, many guns were still covered with wax oil, proving that Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers laid down their weapons without firing a shot. When the PLA entered Xuchang, a Chiang Kai-shek officer stopped commanding the battle, laid down his weapons, and sat quietly in the room waiting for the PLA for five hours. He said, "We don't know who we are fighting for. It is better to lay down our weapons sooner than to be killed." When Chen Fumin, the Major General Brigade Commander of the 5th Brigade of the Provisional 24th Division, was captured alive, he knelt in front of the PLA commander, crying and saying, "I am a war criminal and will be dealt with as you see fit," and said that his capture was "expected long ago, only a matter of time." This is a new development in the Chiang Kai-shek army's "generals lack fighting spirit" and war-weariness.

(3) After land reform and study, and the grievance-airing movement, the PLA's class consciousness has been unprecedentedly enhanced, discipline is particularly good, and marching and combat capabilities have been greatly enhanced, demonstrating heroic and tenacious heroism in combat. A certain unit marched 130 li overnight and annihilated the enemy's 1st Cavalry Brigade at Guanrenzhai with one regiment. A certain unit completely annihilated the enemy's 20th Brigade of the 3rd Division in the Dongjingang Temple battle in Suiping within four hours. In the first few days of the offensive, the PLA captured several county towns every day, advancing more than 100 li. The speed of the PLA's use of troops made the enemy, after being captured alive, still unaware of where the PLA came from. It is now universally known that our army's discipline is strict and that it cherishes the people, so shops remain open as usual after each unit enters the city. Our army also implemented the policy of opening granaries to relieve the poor. In the two cities of Xuchang and Luohe alone, several million catties of relief grain were distributed within a few days after liberation, and more than 100,000 poor people received relief. The PLA is enthusiastically supported by the broad masses of the people everywhere. When our army entered Xuchang and Chenliu, students lined up to welcome them, shouting "Long live the People's Liberation Army." Many farmers, workers, and young students took the initiative to join the PLA.

　　我已掌握战略主动和优势
  　进行下次战略展开的准备
    前线记者报导平汉陇海战役特点
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线十二日电】前线记者报导平汉、陇海战役的特点说：
    （一）解放军赢得了战略上空前的胜利，表现在豫陕鄂、鄂豫皖和苏鲁豫皖三大解放军在广大地区上会师，并协同作战，完全掌握了战略上的主动和优势，开辟了纵横一千多里机动作战的战场，把新解放区的边沿迅速扩大到蒋匪的心脏地带，这对于粉碎蒋贼的“重点防御”，和加快完成解放军下次战略展开的准备，起了十分重大的作用。解放军在这次战役中，斩断了蒋匪内战大动脉平汉南段，并再次破击陇海路，孤立和包围蒋匪河南省城开封，不仅严重威胁战略指挥中心郑州，而且夺取了郑州、信阳间蒋匪的屯兵基地许昌、漯河、驻马店等重要城镇，歼灭几万名蒋匪的有生力量，打乱了中原蒋匪军的整个部署。尤其是第五兵团，自从司令部和整三师全军覆没，二十师遭歼灭性打击后，全兵团已大部丧失了战斗力。蒋匪主力整五师东奔西跑，被打得焦头烂额，损失几千人，逼得邱清泉不敢增援郑州、开封，拖着疲困的部队在毫（县）鹿（邑）淮（阳）太（康）地区兜圈子。蒋贼看到形势紧急，被迫在十二月底从大别山“重点防御”部队中，抽调整九师、整十师、整十一师等部救援平汉路，蒋贼的所谓“空心战术”已完全破产。由于平汉、陇海两路被破坏，郑州、开封等大城市被孤立，蒋贼今后必须分出机动兵力去守备这些城市，因而兵力将更加分散和削弱，而解放军也就更加容易一一歼灭敌人。
    （二）蒋贼的兵力不足和军心厌战，已达到更严重的地步。这次战役前，守备平汉、陇海两路的几乎全是被歼的残余部队和伪杂保安团队等，没有多少主力。守许昌的整四十师三十九旅一一五团，和守兰封的整六十八师一一九旅三五五团，都是三次被歼灭的。整三师和独立二十六旅一部也都是二次被歼灭的。它们在被歼后虽然也补充过，但兵员、武器仍很缺乏。例如三五五团新抓壮丁没有枪，才学开步走，独立廿六旅的炮兵部队有兵没有炮，骑一旅的重兵器营却是有炮没有兵，是个空头建制。这些部队中有不少官兵是曾经被解放军活捉后又放回去的，他们的内心都不愿替蒋贼送死，因此战斗力很弱，多数是一碰就垮，或是稍为打一下就缴枪投降。有好多蒋军在被包围后成班、成排、成连有准备有组织的放下武器，甚至连蒋贼嫡系整三师第三旅第八团团长陈德＠，也亲率全团官兵在西平火线上投降。三五五团士兵有的一听到枪响就做好投降用的白旗，藏在身边。在解放军缴到的武器中，有不少枪，还封满着腊油，证明蒋匪士兵一枪没打就放下了武器。解放军打进许昌时，蒋匪某军官停止指挥战斗，放下武器静坐在房里等了解放军五个钟头，他说：“我们不知道为谁打仗，与其打死不如早些放下武器。”暂二十四师第五旅少将旅长陈扶民被活捉时，跪在解放军指挥员面前，哭着说：“我是战争罪犯，听凭处理”，并说他的被活捉是“早在预料中，只是时间迟早问题”。这是蒋军“将无斗志”，厌战思想新的发展。
    （三）解放军经过土改学习，诉苦运动后，阶级觉悟空前提高，纪律特别良好，行军和战斗力大大增强，在战斗中表现了英勇顽强的英雄主义。某部一夜急行军一百三十里，以一个团追歼敌骑一旅于官仁砦。某部在遂平东金刚寺战斗中，四个钟头内全部歼灭敌整三师二十旅。在攻势开始几天内，解放军每天拿下几座县城，前进一百多里，用兵的神速，使敌被活捉后还不知道解放军是从那里来的。至我军之纪律严明爱护百姓业已尽人皆知，故各部入城后，商店均照常开门营业。我军并实行开仓济贫，仅许昌、漯河两城市在解放后数天内即放发救济粮三四百万斤，十余万贫苦人民护得救济。解放军处处受到广大人民的热忱拥护，当我军进驻许昌、陈留时，学校学生列队欢迎，高呼“人民解放军万岁”。更有许多农人、工人和青年学生自动要求参加解放军。
