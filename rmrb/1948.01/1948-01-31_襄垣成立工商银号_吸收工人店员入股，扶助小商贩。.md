　　Xiangyuan Establishes Industry and Commerce Bank
　　Absorbs Workers and Shop Assistants as Shareholders, Supports Small Vendors.
　　[Xiangyuan News] The Xiangyuan Chengguan Industry and Commerce United Bank officially opened for business on New Year's Day this year. The source of funds is mobilizing shop assistants and workers to deposit and invest in shares. At a meeting of workers, shop assistants, and managers, Feng Guizi said: "In the past, feudal landlords controlled commerce. Workers earned wages, but were never paid until they died. Today, workers can put their earned money into the bank, so that workers can also generate profits, and commerce can also develop." Immediately, he went to various factories and workshops to mobilize. Five hundred workers and shop assistants invested 7.4 million yuan in the bank, including 400,000 yuan in current deposits. In five days of operation, 7.2 million yuan was loaned to 40 small vendors. (Yan Chang, Quan Yi, Qing Xiu, Ju Xiu)

    【襄垣消息】襄垣城关工商联合银号于今年元旦正式营业。资金来源发动店员、工人存款入股。在工人、店员及经理会议上，冯贵子说：“过去封建地主掌握商业，工人赚上工资老死不付给工人。今天工人挣上钱，可以放到银号，使工人也能生利，商业亦能发展。”随即到各厂坊动员，有五百个工人、店员向银号投资七百四十万元，内有活期存款四十万元。营业五天，贷给了四十家小商贩七百二十万元。（言昌、全义、清秀、巨秀）
