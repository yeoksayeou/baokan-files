　　Cadres Engage in Empty Talk to Mobilize Poor and Hired Peasants; Winter Production is a Mess
　　Editor:
　　In Wu'an, the mobilization of hired and poor peasants for winter production work was greatly delayed due to the public grain campaign. On the 20th of this month (i.e., last month's 20th), the 7th District convened a joint meeting of hired and poor peasant cadres and masses to summarize the army recruitment and public grain campaign, and to arrange for the mobilization of hired and poor peasants for production, actually a month later than elsewhere. The reason for the delay was that the mobilization of hired and poor peasants for winter production was not well connected with the army recruitment and public grain campaign.
　　My village, Wangucheng, is considered a relatively good village among the three base villages of Changting (actually a backward village, "relatively good" is a comparison, and some district cadres are complacent about this, claiming credit from higher levels, which is really inexplicable). This time, after the cadres and masses returned from the meeting, they held a farmers' association meeting on the 25th, conveying all the issues discussed at the meeting and first proposed several issues such as "cleaning up the remaining problems of mutual aid teams," "calculating family property," "rectifying small cooperatives," and "formulating winter production plans," asking the groups to discuss and report back in three days. As a result, the New Year entertainment was very lively, but the group discussions were very perfunctory. According to talks with several group leaders, they only said that the meeting was held, there were no remaining problems with mutual aid, they were thinking of picking up and cutting firewood for winter production, the family property was not specifically calculated, and the specific winter production plan was even less discussed. Upon further questioning, some said: Our group bought another batch of sheep; some said: Our group increased its shares by so much; or these days we are all cutting firewood, etc. They simply did not grasp the basic spirit of mobilizing hired and poor peasants. Not to mention establishing the backbone of poor and hired peasants, even general organized and led production is impossible. In this way, mobilizing hired and poor peasants for winter production will become empty talk.
　　The main reason for this phenomenon is that here they repeatedly instructed at the meeting: "Finding hired and poor peasants" should be carried out secretly, not publicly, so as not to affect the emotions of the middle peasants (this is what the village cadres conveyed, whether it is true or not is unknown). Therefore, the slogans of establishing the backbone of hired and poor peasants, the leadership of hired and poor peasants, etc., dare not be mentioned at all, and everyone is playing dumb. In fact, among the cadres and masses who went to the meeting, some were middle peasants, and a few were bankrupt landlords, and their emotions had long been shaken. Before receiving this instruction, they were grumbling secretly, and after returning from the meeting, they did not convey it at the farmers' association, but they were already grumbling behind their backs. As a result, the emotions of the middle peasants are even worse, the hired and poor peasants do not know when they can be mobilized, and winter production is bound to fail even more. (Ding Mang)

### 干部空谈发动贫雇　冬季生产不象样子

　　干部空谈发动贫雇
  　冬季生产不象样子编辑同志：
    武安对于发动雇贫冬季生产工作，因为义运公粮是大大推迟了些。本月二十日（按即上月二十日）第七区召开雇贫干群联席会，总结参军义运，布置发动雇贫生产，实际上较别处迟了一个月。推迟原因，实际是把发动雇贫冬季生产和参军义运没有很好的联系起来。
    我住村万谷城是长亭基点三个村中一向认为工作较好的村（实际是个落后村，较好是比较而言，而有些区干部以此自满，向上级邀功，真是莫名其妙），这回干部群众开会回来，在二十五日开了一次农会，把这次开会讨论的问题算都传达了，并先提出：“清理互助组遗留问题”，“算家当”，“整顿小型合作社”，“订冬季生产计划”等几个问题，让小组讨论，限三天汇报。而结果新年娱乐闹的怪红火，小组会讨论问题则稀松的很。根据几个小组长谈话，只说开了会了，互助没有遗留问题，冬季生产正想法拾砍，家当没具体算，冬季生产的具体计划更谈不上。再追求下去，有说：俺组又买了一批羊，有说：俺组又增加了多少股金，或这几天都在割柴等等。根本就没掌握住发动雇贫的基本精神，不要说树立贫雇骨干做不到，就是一般的有组织有领导的生产也作不到。这样发动雇贫冬季生产将形成一句空话。
    造成这种现象的主要原因，是这里在会上再三嘱咐：“找雇贫”要秘密进行，不可公开，以免影响中农情绪（这是村干的传达，确否不知）。因此树立雇贫骨干，雇贫领导等口号提都不敢提一声，大家在打闷葫芦。而实际去开会的干部和群众中，有些就是中农，少数是破产地主，他们的情绪早就震荡不定。没得到这个指示以前，他们就在暗中圪嚷，开会回来在农会上不传达，在背后早又圪嚷开了。如此一来，中农情绪更加不好，雇贫也不知何时能发动起来，冬季生产势必更加落空了。（丁芒）
