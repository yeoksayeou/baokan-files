Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. A comprehensive dispatch from Rome: The Italian people's democratic movement continues to expand, and the land reform movement is also surging. Following major cities such as Milan, Turin, Genoa, Pescara, and Florence, the Brescia city (belonging to the Lombardy province) has also established a local organization of the People's Democratic Front. Leaders of the Italian Communist Party and Socialist Party, the Christian Socialist Party, the Garibaldi Guerrilla Brigade, and representatives of various democratic groups participated. A branch of the Southern Italian People's Democratic Front has also been established in Andria, Bari province. In the past two weeks, the movement of Italian peasants and agricultural workers demanding land reform has spread throughout Italy. Agricultural workers in Pezenza (southeast of Milan) occupied a large area of "state-owned land" in the Po River basin and jointly cultivated it. Agricultural workers in Verona, the province of Pesaro (central Italy, on the Adriatic coast), and the province of Catanzaro (southern Italy) rose up and occupied large amounts of land and, in the manner of factory management committees, organized "land committees" to manage the occupied land themselves. Recently, 10,000 agricultural workers in Venice continued their strike, demanding jobs for the unemployed. Agricultural workers and the unemployed also held large demonstrations in Treviso (north of Venice) and Venice. Fifty thousand agricultural workers participated in a strike in the province of Naples. Agricultural workers in the Maga area also went on strike on the 12th, demanding the revision of the enslaving tenancy agreements with landlords. On the same day, the Sicilian Peasants' Congress convened in Palermo, with 2,000 Italian peasant representatives demanding land participating. The congress passed a resolution instructing the land committees to launch a struggle to demand land. Strikes and demonstrations by the Italian working people have emerged in other cities. On the 15th, five hundred disabled veterans demonstrated in front of the Rome Central Police Station, protesting the reactionary government's indifference to their plight and demanding increased pensions and welfare. The working people of Milan, under the leadership of the Italian Communist Party, also held demonstrations in support of the fifteen soldiers from Verona who were arrested during a demonstration protesting the reactionary government's postponement of demobilization. L'Unità warned the reactionary government, saying: "If the arrested are not released immediately, there will be a greater expression tomorrow." The western Italian port of Livorno announced a general strike in protest against unemployment. Six thousand workers from 140 factories of the Montecatini chemical trust (northwest of Florence, Italy), demanding "production bonuses," held a continuous two-hour strike struggle for twelve days and have won victory.
