Sweeping Outlying Strongholds of Anyang
　　Our Army Annihilates 500 Bandits in Four Days
　　[Jinan, Hebei News, 9th] Amidst the New Year's greetings, our army launched a fierce offensive against the enemy in the outskirts of Anyang. On December 25th, six battalions of the 40th Division of the Anyang Chiang bandits and more than 6,000 local bandits looted Shuiye. Our army bravely resisted at Guxian and Mazhang southeast of Shuiye, killing and wounding more than 50 enemies. At 4:00 AM on the 26th, our army attacked the strongholds of Caiyuan, Xihe, and Gezhuang southeast of Anyang in separate routes. After 15 minutes of battle, the three strongholds were recovered, and part of the enemy was annihilated. The remnants fled to Gaoqi and Chengang, and then gathered more than 600 people to counterattack, but were repelled twice by us. On the same day, another unit of our army forcibly attacked Wang Huaimi's department of the Jiang Security Regiment and more than 150 members of the Home Returning Corps of the Jiangtai and Jiangtai (Wadian) west. After about half an hour of fighting, all the enemies were annihilated, and the two strongholds were recovered. At 9:00 AM on the same day, more than 100 enemies from Wangliutun and Zhengsi supported the enemy and counterattacked us twice, but were defeated. On the evening of the 28th, our army raided the Balizhuang stronghold east of Anyang and annihilated the entire enemy Grand Township Office. Another unit attacked the Wangjiadian stronghold. When the enemy's 40th Division intelligence station heard the gunfire, it fled to Anyang. Eight enemies were killed and 66 were captured. In the above battles, a total of 148 enemies were killed or wounded, 398 enemies were captured including the battalion commander Wang Lianyuan, four light machine guns, 82 rifles and carbines, 34 short guns, more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition of various types, 17 grenades, 17 mules and horses, 11 bicycles, and one telephone.
