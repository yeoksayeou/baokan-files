　　【This newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, 6th dispatch】In response to the call from the General Command of War Services to save manpower, reduce the people's burden, and better support the frontline operations, Xu Ji, Zhuxian, Liaoyang and other counties have organized standing stretcher teams. Counties, districts, and villages have successively held meetings of cadres and the masses to explain why standing stretchers are organized and what benefits they bring. After discussion by the masses, the liberated peasants enthusiastically participated in the standing stretcher teams and proposed: "The army at the front is fighting for us, it is right for us to provide stretchers." The farmers and women at home voluntarily proposed: "Help those going to the front with their work, and taking care of the work at home will not be delayed either. You can go to the front with peace of mind!" Currently, Liaoyang already has 870 young adults who have formed standing stretcher teams, ready to set off. Standing stretcher teams in other counties such as Zhuxian are being organized.

　　聊阳等县支援前线
  　组织常备担架队
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】为响应战勤总指挥部节省民力减轻人民负担、更好的支援前线作战的号召，徐冀、筑先、聊阳等县，组织常备担架。各县区、村先后召开了干部与群众会议，说明为什么组织常备担架，有那些好处。经群众讨论后，翻身农民们都踊跃的参加常备担架，并提出：“前方军队为咱打仗，咱出担架理应当。”在家的农民、妇女们，都自愿的提出：“帮助上前方的做活，保管家里活也不误。你们安心上前方吧！”目前聊阳已有八百七十名青壮年组成了常备担架，准备出征。其他筑先等县常备担架，正在组织中。
