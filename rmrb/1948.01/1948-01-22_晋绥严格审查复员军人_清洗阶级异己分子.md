　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 18th. The Jin-Sui Military Region Headquarters Political Department and the Border Region Administrative Office jointly issued a decision and instructions on demobilization work on December 6th, pointing out that: due to the past demobilization regulations not being clear enough, and the relevant authorities not handling it carefully enough, some who should not have been demobilized were, and even class alien elements, speculators, local bullies, riffraff, and hooligans etc. have fraudulently obtained demobilization certificates and preferential treatment, flaunting and undermining government decrees, oppressing the masses, committing all kinds of evil, affecting military-civilian unity, hindering land reform, and causing dissatisfaction among the masses and genuine demobilized soldiers. In order to overcome this chaotic situation, it is decided that:

　　First, all those who have been demobilized should be subjected to strict review in the land reform movement. (1) Demobilized soldiers who meet the demobilization conditions, abide by government laws and decrees, are of good character, actively participate in land reform, work hard in production, or continue to serve the masses, should be appropriately commended and rewarded, and their return-home certificates should be taken back and cancelled. (2) Class alien elements, speculators, enemy and puppet elements, local bullies, etc., should have their certificates confiscated, the preferential materials obtained by fraud recovered, and be unconditionally handled by the masses. (3) Other types of people who should be purged and expelled but have fraudulently obtained demobilized soldier treatment should have their certificates confiscated, the preferential materials obtained by fraud or public funds and materials illegally stolen should be recovered, and be handed over to the masses for supervision, education, and transformation. If the family is poor and the performance after returning home is still good, they can be treated leniently at discretion. (4) Streamlined personnel who do not meet the demobilization conditions should have their demobilized soldier treatment stopped, and their certificates recovered. The preferential materials they have obtained should be retained at discretion according to their history and performance after demobilization. Those without crimes can be treated the same as basic masses. Those who have committed crimes of oppressing and harming the masses must still be handed over to the masses for handling. (5) Those who return home due to lack of labor in the family, although they can be regarded as demobilized soldiers, the preferential treatment they enjoy should be stopped immediately, and they should still return to the team when they meet the conditions for returning to the team. Those who should not have been demobilized but obtained demobilization procedures by taking advantage of work negligence should have their demobilized soldier status cancelled. They must still return to the team when they meet the conditions for returning to the team. (6) Honored soldiers who have been demobilized and are truly disabled due to combat or official duties should be compensated according to the decision method; however, when their disability situation changes or disappears, the county government should designate a doctor to examine them, or the masses should evaluate and change or cancel their rank; those whose rank is cancelled should stop the compensation and recover the honorary certificate, and be treated as general demobilized soldiers. Those who meet the conditions for returning to the team can return to the team. Those who are disabled not due to combat against the enemy or official duties, or disabled prisoners of war captured by us, should have their honorary certificates recovered and the compensation they have enjoyed recovered. If the family is indeed poor, the recovery of some parts can be reduced or exempted at discretion, and the demobilized soldier status can be cancelled or retained. Those who have not been injured or disabled but have fraudulently obtained or bought honorary certificates by taking advantage of work negligence or private relationships, or those who have fraudulently claimed more than one certificate, in addition to confiscating the honorary certificate and recovering the fraudulently obtained compensation materials, must be punished according to law, and the original certificate issuing agency or the certificate seller must be investigated. (7) Those who meet the conditions for elderly preferential treatment should be treated preferentially according to the decision method, and those who do not meet the conditions should have their certificates and preferential treatment revoked (according to past regulations, elderly soldiers who have been in the military for more than five years and less than ten years and have elderly preferential treatment certificates should also have their certificates recovered and preferential treatment stopped. The preferential treatment already enjoyed can be exempted from recovery), those whose certificates are obtained through improper channels, in addition to recovering the certificates and preferential treatment, should be punished according to law, and their related persons should be investigated. Those who obtained honorary certificates due to old age should have their honorary certificates recovered, and if they are indeed in compliance with the conditions for elderly preferential treatment, they can apply to the special commissioner's office for approval to exchange for an elderly certificate. (8) Those who are indeed suffering from serious chronic diseases due to official duties should be treated preferentially according to the decision method, and if they obtained honorary certificates due to illness, the honorary certificates should be recovered. After the county government is responsible for reviewing their history and family situation, if they meet the preferential treatment conditions, they should apply to the administrative office for approval of preferential treatment. (9) Those who meet the conditions for demobilized soldiers, but do not engage in production, engage in speculation and opportunism, are of bad character, oppress the masses, undermine government laws and decrees, obstruct land reform, harm the interests of the masses, and do not repent after repeated education, should have their demobilized soldier status revoked and handed over to the masses for handling. (10) Those who settle in more than two places and fraudulently obtain more than two copies of preferential treatment should have their preferential materials recovered and be punished according to law. Those who transfer their place of residence on their own must obtain proof from the masses and government of the original resettlement location, and be handled at discretion by the masses and government of the current residence. (11) All recovered demobilization certificates, honorary certificates, and elderly certificates should be reported by the county government to the administrative office for cancellation.

　　Second, in order to prevent the continued occurrence of malpractices, so that demobilized persons have a means of livelihood, those in service are actively upward, and truly achieve the purpose of consolidating the troops, in the future when dealing with demobilized personnel, the relevant authorities must carry out this work with the spirit of being responsible to the masses and with a high degree of political responsibility. Resolutely overcome all irresponsible erroneous attitudes such as shirking responsibility and perfunctoriness.

　　Third, the resettlement of demobilized soldiers should pay attention to the following points: (1) Those whose homes are in the liberated area and can return should be introduced to return to their place of origin for production, and should not be introduced to settle in other counties. Demobilized soldiers who have settled down should also be helped to return to their place of origin as much as possible according to their specific circumstances. However, except for those returning to their place of origin, others should generally no longer transfer, in order to solve their land problem in a planned manner. (2) Those whose homes are in non-liberated areas and cannot return should be resettled in rural areas for production as much as possible, and should not be concentrated in a few counties, towns, or a few villages. (3) Except for first and second-class honored soldiers, all demobilized soldiers within the age of military service must perform military service, except those who are disabled, old, and lose their ability to work, and the masses evaluate and give certain labor assistance.

　　晋绥严格审查复员军人
  　清洗阶级异己分子
    【新华社晋绥十八日电】晋绥军区司令部政治部及边区行政公署，于十二月六日联合颁布关于复员工作的决定及指示，指出：由于过去复员条例规定的不够明确，及各有关机关处理时不够慎重，使一些不应复员的也复员了，甚至阶级异己分子、投机分子、恶霸、兵痞、流氓等也骗得了复员证和优待，招摇破坏政府法令，欺压群众，为非作歹，影响军民团结，阻碍了土地改革，引起群众及真正复员军人之不满。为克服这种混乱情形，决定：
    第一、已复员的要在土地改革运动中普遍进行严格审查。（一）凡符合复员条件、遵守政府法令、品行端正、积极参加土地改革、努力生产或继续为群众服务的复员军人，应加以适当的表扬奖励，并继续照顾和优待，其还乡证则应收回注销。（二）阶级异己分子、投机分子、敌伪分子、恶霸等，应没收其证件，追回骗取之优待物资，无条件由群众处理。（三）其他各种应该清洗开除而骗得复员军人待遇者，应没收其证件，追回其骗得之优待物资，或不法窃取之公款公物，交群众监督、教育、改造。如家庭贫苦，还乡后表现尚好者，可酌情从宽处理。（四）不合复员条件之精简人员，应停止其复员军人之待遇，并收回证件，其已得之优待物资，应按其历史与复员后之表现酌情保留，无罪恶者可与基本群众同等待遇。如有欺压群众为害群众罪行者，仍须交群众处理。（五）因家庭缺乏劳动力而还乡者，虽得视为复员军人，其所享受之优待应即停止，有归队条件时仍应归队。本不应复员而利用工作疏忽取得复员手续者，应取消其复员军人资格。有归队条件时仍须归队。（六）已复员之荣誉军人，真正因作战或因公残废者，按决定办法抚恤之；但其残废情况变更或消灭时，应由县政府指定医生检查，或由群众评议变更或取消其等级；等级取消者，停止抚恤，收回荣誉证，按一般复员军人待遇。有归队条件者可归队。非因对敌作战，也非因公而致残废者，或被我俘获之伤残俘虏，应收回荣誉证，追回其已享受之抚恤。家庭确系贫苦者，可酌情减免追回部分，取消或保留其复员军人资格。并未伤残而利用工作疏忽或私人关系骗得或买得荣誉证，或一人拐领双证以上者，除没收荣誉证，追回骗取之抚恤物资外，须依法制裁，并追究原发证件机关或卖证人。（七）符合老年优待条件者，按决定办法优待之，不合者撤销其证件与优待（按过去规定，在五年以上十年以下之老年军人，领有老年优待证者，亦应收回证件停止优待。已享受之优待可免予追回），证件来历不正者，除追回证件及优待外，应依法制裁，并追究其关系人。因年老而取得荣誉证者，收回荣誉证，审查确合老年优待条件时，可呈请专署批准换发老年证。（八）确系因公致患严重慢性病者，按决定办法优待之，如因病而取得荣誉证者，收回荣誉证。经县府负责审查其历史与家境，合于优待条件者，呈请行署批准优待之。（九）符合复员军人条件，但不事生产，投机取巧，品行不正，欺压群众，破坏政府法令，阻挠土地改革，损害群众利益，屡经教育而不悔悟者，应撤销其复员军人资格，交群众处理。（十）两处以上安家，骗取两份以上优待者，应追回其优待物资并依法制裁。自行转移住地者，须取得原安置地群众与政府之证明，并由现住地群众与政府酌情处理。（十一）所有收回之复员证、荣誉证、老年证均应由县政府汇报行署注销。
    第二、为杜绝流弊之继续产生，使复员者生活有寄，在职者积极向上，真正达到巩固部队之目的，今后处理复员人员时，各有关机关必须以为群众负责的精神，以高度政治责任心来从事这个工作。坚决克服一切推诿、敷衍等不负责的错误态度。
    第三、对复员军人的安置，应注意下列各点：（一）家在解放区可能回去者，一律介绍回原籍生产，不得介绍安家于其他县。已安家之复员军人，亦应根据其具体情形，尽量帮助其返回原籍。但除回原籍者外，其他一般应不再转移，以便有计划的解决其土地问题。（二）家在非解放区不能回去者，应尽量分散安置于农村生产，不得集中于少数县份市镇或少数村庄。（三）复员军人除因残疾年老丧失生产能力，由群众评议给予一定之劳力帮助外，一律不得使用军勤。除一二等荣誉军人外，所有在服军勤年龄之复员军人，均须服军勤。
