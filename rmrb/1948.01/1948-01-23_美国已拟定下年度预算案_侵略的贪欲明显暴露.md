Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Washington dispatch: The US budget for the next year (July 1, 1948 to June 30, 1949) was submitted to the US Congress by Truman on the 12th. This budget clearly exposes the aggressive greed of US imperialism. The total expenditure is 39.669 billion US dollars, of which the army, navy and air force expenditure accounts for 28 percent, that is, 11.209 billion US dollars; international expenses account for 18 percent, that is, 7 billion US dollars (of which 4.5 billion US dollars are used for "aid to Europe"); the sum of these two items accounts for more than 46 percent of the total budget, that is, more than 18 billion US dollars. In terms of national income: Truman's proposed budget hopes to increase the total tax revenue to 42.155 billion US dollars, with other miscellaneous income of 2.3 billion US dollars. It is said that as a result of the new budget, the defense cost borne by each American citizen increased from 8 yuan in 1938 to 75 yuan in 1949; the international expenses borne by each American citizen increased from 15 cents in 1939 to 48 yuan in 1949. In 1949, it increased to 48 yuan; the sum of the two items, the cost of aggression borne by each American, reached 123 US dollars. The average weekly wage of American workers in July last year was 48.5 US dollars. The additional burden solely for the benefit of monopoly capital giants will inevitably greatly increase the difficulty for them to support their families and maintain their lives. After the budget was announced, it was strongly opposed by all parties in the United States. On the 12th, when the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee listened to Marshall's statement on the so-called "European Recovery Plan," someone questioned Marshall and said, "Do you think this plan will cause a war?"

　　美国已拟定下年度预算案
  　侵略的贪欲明显暴露
    【新华社陕北二十日电】华盛顿讯：美国下年度（一九四八年七月一日至一九四九年六月三十日）预算案，已于十二日由杜鲁门向美国国会提出；这个预算明显的暴露了美国帝国主义对外侵略的贪欲。该支出总额三百九十六亿六千九百万美元，其中陆海空军费占百分之二十八，即一百十二亿零九百万美元；国际经费占百分之十八，即七十亿美元（其中作“援欧”之用的为四五亿美元）；两项合计占全部预算百分之四十六以上，即一百八十余亿美元。在国家收入方面：杜鲁门提出之预算案，希望将税收总额增至四百二十一亿五千五百万美元，其他杂项收入二十三亿美元。据称：新预算之结果，每一美国公民负担之国防费用，在一九三八年为八元，至一九四九年则增至七十五元；每一美国公民所负担之国际费用，一九三九年为一角五分，至一九四九年则增至四十八元；两项合计，每一美国人所负担的用于侵略的费用，达一百二十三美元。美国工人去年七月平均工资为每周四十八元五角，仅仅为了独占资本巨头们的利益的额外负担，势必大大增加他们赡养家庭与维持生活的困难。这个预算公布后，遭到美国各方强烈反对。十二日，美国众议院外交委员会，聆取马歇尔关于所谓“欧洲复原计划”的声明时，曾有人质问马歇尔说：“君以为此计划将引起战争否？”
