　　[Comprehensive report from this newspaper by Xinhua News Agency] The Jiaodong People's Liberation Army, which has won many victories, eliminated more than 60,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the last four months of last year. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits have been completely squeezed into a small area along the Beihai coast. Beginning in August of last year, after the Chen Su troops marched west, Chiang Kai-shek pieced together six divisions and launched a fierce offensive against the Jiaodong Liberated Area. The Xu Tan army, which remained in Jiaodong, opened its pocket and allowed this mad dog to enter, while lightly turning to the flanks and repeatedly inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. In more than a month, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits lost more than 10,000 men in exchange for a dozen or so empty cities. The enemy's blind offensive suffered a severe blow. After October, our army eliminated more than 10,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits along the Jiahe River, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were forced into a full defensive posture. At this time, our counter-offensive army took advantage of the victory to recover Yexian and Zhucheng, and even advanced into Yantai City for a time. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Muping, Qixia, Zhaoyuan and other counties were also frightened and abandoned their cities and fled, and the vast lost territories of Jiaodong were quickly recovered by us. In November and December, our army continued to win several major victories in Haiyang, Laiyang and other places, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who invaded Jiaodong were finally driven to the narrow and long area of Longkou, Huangxian, Penglai, Fushan and Yantai on the Bohai coast. The time when they will all be annihilated is not far away. The Eastern Front Corps Command of the East China People's Liberation Army summarized the detailed battle achievements of the great victory in Jiaodong in these four months (September to December) as follows (the previously announced annihilation of 300,000 enemies in East China in one year does not include this battle record): (1) A total of 63,067 enemy regular and irregular troops were killed, wounded, or captured, including 21,790 captured alive. This included Zhang Zhongzhong, commander of the 211th Brigade of the Regular Army 45th Division, acting Chief of Staff Lu Chengyu, Director of the News Office Xiao Dingjing, Zhang Xianchen, commander of the 1st Regiment of the Brigade, Wu Zhaocheng, deputy commander, Wang Wenhan, commander of the 3rd Regiment, Chen Jie, commander of the 476th Regiment of the 159th Brigade of the 64th Division, Pan Jiping, deputy commander, and others totaling 15,790 people, Chen Chuqiao, magistrate of Gaomi County, Nie Jinchen, magistrate of Zhucheng County and others totaling 6,000 irregular troops. 41,277 were killed or wounded. Including Jin Mengrong, deputy commander of the 211th Brigade, Li Zhengxi, commander of the 2nd Regiment of the Brigade, Zhang Xiliang, deputy commander of the 3rd Regiment, Li Kewen, deputy commander of the 475th Regiment of the 159th Brigade of the 64th Division, Xiao Fengming, commander of the 170th Regiment of the 57th Brigade of the 74th Division, and others.
