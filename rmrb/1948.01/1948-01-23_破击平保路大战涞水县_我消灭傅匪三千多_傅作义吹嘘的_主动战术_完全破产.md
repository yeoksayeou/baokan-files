Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 21st – The Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Army Front Headquarters has issued Public Communique No. 7, stating: After our army launched a large-scale sabotage operation against the Pingbao Railway on December 27th, we followed up on January 6th with a mopping-up operation against the outskirts of Baoding, immediately clearing out most of the enemy blockhouses on the periphery, causing shock in Baoding. In order to salvage the crisis of the Pingbao line and rescue Baoding, Bandit Fu dispatched the entire 16th Army, the 94th Army, the Provisional 3rd Army, and two divisions of the 35th Army, along with the 12th Brigade of the 4th Cavalry Division, to reinforce Baoding along the west side of the Pingbao Railway. Along the way, they encountered fierce resistance and flanking attacks from our army. By the 10th, the enemy's main force had converged in the northwest of Baoding, attempting to disrupt the Mancheng and Wanxian areas. At the same time, our powerful forces launched a surprise attack on Laishui, completely occupying the four passes on the evening of the 11th. Bandit Fu hurriedly redeployed the main force of the 35th Army, which was reinforcing Baoding, to the north to reinforce Laishui. On the 12th, the enemy advanced to Zhuangtuan (erroneously reported as Zhuangding in yesterday's telegram) southeast of Laishui and was encircled by our army. After 16 hours of fierce fighting, the main force of the New 32nd Division of the enemy's 35th Army in Zhuangtuan, including the division headquarters, most of the 94th and 96th Regiments, part of the 95th Regiment, and an entire mountain artillery company directly under the division, as well as a howitzer battalion directly under the 35th Army, were annihilated by us. The remaining enemy, about a thousand strong, fled to the Lijiacun area northwest of Gaobeidian and was again intercepted and largely annihilated by another unit of our army. The enemy's 101st Division, which advanced to Wucun, was also severely attacked by us, suffering losses, and fled towards Dingxing and Gaobeidian. The Provisional 17th Division of the 35th Army, which was reinforcing from Zhuoxian to the west, was also repelled by us in the northeast of Laishui. By this point, the main force of Bandit Fu's 35th Army, the New 32nd Division, had been largely annihilated, and the 101st Division had also suffered losses. In this battle, we killed or wounded over 2,000 enemy soldiers, including the commander of the New 32nd Division, Li Mingding (killed), the commander of the 94th Regiment, Duan Xixiang, and the deputy commander, Bai Hongjun. We captured over 1,570 enemy soldiers, seized one howitzer, two mountain guns, six mortars, twenty 60mm mortars, six grenade launchers, 139 light and heavy machine guns, over 1,080 rifles, 135 American-made submachine guns, seven grenade launchers, over 80 vehicles, and some ammunition.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 21st – The Jin-Cha-Ji Daily published an editorial celebrating the great victory of the sabotage campaign on the northern Jin-Cha-Ji front, saying: The large-scale sabotage campaign by the Liberated Army against the four major railways of PingSui, PingHan, BeiNing, and JinPu has not only shattered the transportation between Tianjin, Beijing, and Baoding in the heart of North China, but has also disrupted the entire deployment of the Chiang-Fu bandit army. The Liberated Army annihilated most of Bandit Fu's old establishment, the New 32nd Division of the 35th Army, parts of the 101st Division and the howitzer battalion directly under the army, as well as a regiment of the Provisional 11th Division of the Provisional 3rd Army, and part of the Provisional 26th Division of the Provisional 4th Army, in Zhuangtuan east of Laishui on the northern section of the PingHan Railway and in the Yanqing and Yongning areas on the eastern section of the PingSui Railway, and killed Li Mingding, the commander of the New 32nd Division. The so-called "active tactics" that Bandit Fu Zuoyi has been clamoring about for a long time have been declared bankrupt. The editorial called on all commanders and fighters of the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Army to carefully study the experience of this operation, carry forward the glorious tradition of heroic fighting, and annihilate more and larger numbers of the Chiang-Fu bandit army.
