　　Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 19th: The Eyuwan Military Region direct units have launched a study of Chairman Mao's report "The Present Situation and Our Tasks." Various units are using breaks in combat to hold special meetings to conduct study. At the same time, in coordination with checking components, checking ideology, and reorganizing the ranks, they are mobilizing the masses in their stationed areas to carry out land reform. In the work of studying and participating in land reform, many comrades believe that understanding how to analyze rural classes from a class viewpoint is the first lesson that should be learned in doing mass work; otherwise, one will inevitably be detached from the standpoint of the poor and hired peasants. For example, the so-called landlord work and "full jar movement" in the past lacked clear class character. Now, the comrades of the direct units have developed a trend of actively investigating and researching, analyzing rural class relations, talking with the poor and hired peasants, and learning from them. In the past, some people often wanted to live in the good houses of landlords, but now they are willing to live in the homes of poor peasants in order to conduct investigation and research. Each work team and each unit has conducted relatively detailed investigations of the political and economic aspects of the stationed villages. A political liaison officer made a very meaningful investigation and analysis of the population, land, livestock, class relations, Chiang bandit conscription, levies, exploitation, baojia figures, and various methods of oppressing peasants in a stationed village of twenty-five households. In their recent study and land reform work, they have also realized that if each unit wants to do a good job in mass work in the stationed villages, it is impossible to rely solely on a few civilian affairs workers; the leaders must personally take action and organize all cadres and soldiers to participate in the work in order to have strength. This is a work of ideological construction for the troops, and various units are now carrying it out.

　　鄂豫皖军区直属队
  　学习毛主席报告
  　结合三查参加驻村土地改革
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十九日电】鄂豫皖军区直属队展开学习毛主席“目前形势和我们的任务”的报告，各单位利用战斗空隙，召开专门会议，进行学习。同时，配合查成份、查思想、整编队伍，在驻地发动群众进行土地改革。在学习和参加土地改革工作中，许多同志认为懂得如何用阶级观点分析农村阶级，是做群众工作应学习的第一课，否则就必然脱离贫雇群众的立场，如过去所谓房东工作、“满缸运动”，就缺乏明确的阶级性。现在直属队的同志们，产生一种积极调查研究，分析农村阶级关系、找贫雇谈话和向贫雇学习的风气。过去有些人常想住地主的好房子，现在都愿住在贫农家里，以便进行调查研究。每个工作队和各单位，对驻村都做了比较详细的经济政治各方面的调查。有个政治协理员，曾把一个二十五户的驻村人口、土地、牲畜、阶级关系、蒋匪抓丁、派款、剥削、保甲人物、及各种各样欺压农民的办法，做了很有意义的调查和分析。他们在最近的学习和土地改革工作中，还体会到：如果各单位要把驻村群众工作作好，仅依靠少数民运工作人员是办不到的，必须首长亲自动手，把全体干部战士组织起来参加工作，才有力量。这是部队一个思想建设的工作，现在各单位正在进行。
