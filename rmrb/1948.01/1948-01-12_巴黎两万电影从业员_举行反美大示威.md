Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: A major demonstration of 20,000 film industry workers took place in Paris on the 5th, protesting the crimes of French and American reactionaries in strangling the French film industry. As a result of the Blum-Byrnes agreement, American films have massively invaded France, plunging the French film industry, which ranks second in French industry, into a tragic situation, with about 20,000 workers and experts facing the danger of unemployment. This situation has aroused great indignation among the broad masses of French society. As the film industry workers' demonstration passed through the streets of Paris, Parisian students gathered on the sidewalks to pay tribute to the demonstrators. The demonstrators held protest slogans such as "The French Film Industry Wants to Live!" and "Money is Being Spent on American Films, While We Have No Money to Eat!" The newspaper *l'Humanité* published a statement by the famous actress Sullon, who participated in the demonstration, saying: "American tycoons want to destroy our entire culture; they want to strangle our film industry. And the Blum-Byrnes agreement has betrayed our film industry. Our government refuses to reconsider this agreement, which is so shameful! We have warned all political parties, but only the Communist Party is fighting for our film industry. We thank the French Communist Party." Although the demonstration was peaceful in nature, the Socialist Minister of the Interior, Moch, ordered the police to suppress it with armed force, resulting in several injuries to the protesters and 90 arrests.

　　巴黎两万电影从业员
  　举行反美大示威
    【新华社陕北九日电】巴黎讯：此间五日发生两万电影从业员的大示威，抗议法美反动派绞杀法国电影工业的罪行。由于勃鲁姆、贝纳斯协定的结果，美国影片大量侵入法国，使在法国工业中占第二位的电影工业，陷入悲惨境地，约有两万工人与专家面临失业危险。此种情势引起法国广大社会人士的极大愤慨。当电影从业员的示威行列，通过巴黎街头时，巴黎的学生纷纷群集人行道上，向示威者致敬。示威者手执“法国电影界要活命！”“钱正用在美片上，而我们却无钱吃饭！”等抗议标语。人道报刊载参加示威的著名女演员素龙的声明称：“美国大亨想毁灭我们全部文化，他们想扼杀我们的电影工业。而勃鲁姆、贝纳斯协定出卖了我们的电影工业。我们的政府拒绝重新考虑这一协定，这多么丢脸！我们向一切政党提出警告，但是只有共产党是在为我们的电影工业而斗争。我们感谢法共。”虽然示威是和平性质的，但社会党内政部长摩许仍下令警察武装镇压，结果游行者伤数人，九十人被捕。
