Xinhua News Agency reporter's commentary on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's "currency reform plan":

　　Chiang Kai-shek bandit's economic crisis is incurable, so he's playing new tricks to harm the people and sell out the country
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 27th] Just as prices are soaring in the Chiang-controlled areas, and markets in various places are increasingly showing chaos and unrest, the issue of so-called "currency reform" is widely circulating in major cities like Nanjing and Shanghai. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit government has also dispatched comprador magnate Bei Zuyi to the United States to discuss with the US government the "most effective form of assistance." It is said that Bei carries with him a "plan related to currency reform." A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented: As early as last year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government, through Huang Yuanbin (member of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's National Economic Commission), continuously promoted its so-called "currency reform plan." Huang dreamed that as long as his "currency reform plan" was followed, it would stabilize foreign exchange and stabilize prices. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek bandit government officials, including Chiang Kai-shek and Sun Ke, have also been promoting it in the same way. This illustrates: First, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government's economic crisis has reached an incurable point, and the Chiang currency is indeed very difficult to maintain. Second, the series of "emergency measures" taken by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government in the past year have completely failed.
    The Chiang Kai-shek bandit government's "currency reform" is by no means for the sake of "stabilizing prices," but a new conspiracy to plunder the people in the Chiang-controlled areas on an even larger scale. The realization of this conspiracy will render the value of the Chiang currency currently held by the people in the Chiang-controlled areas worthless, thereby concentrating the little living resources in the hands of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas even more into the hands of the four major families, in order to engage in civil war and delay their final collapse. On the other hand, the so-called "currency reform plan" also contains a new conspiracy to sell out the country. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit government raised this issue in order to request loans from the United States, while what the US imperialists want is Chinese sovereignty. The mission of comprador magnate Bei Zuyi's trip to the United States is to negotiate the terms of selling out the country. According to a United Press report on January 14th: "The US State Department is proceeding through semi-official channels," but mainly through informal channels—through "secret" conditions proposed by senior officials in Nanjing and Washington. The US State Department will agree to "request appropriations from Congress" on this basis. This news exposes that new treasonous negotiations are secretly underway between Chiang and the US, which requires the people of the whole country to rise up to oppose it, and must call on the American people to join the Chinese people in stopping the US government's reactionary behavior of aiding Chiang in the civil war and undermining the peaceful friendship between the Chinese and American people.

### 记者评蒋匪“货币改革计划”　蒋匪经济危机没法治又耍新花头害民卖国

　　新华社记者评蒋匪“货币改革计划”
  　蒋匪经济危机没法治又耍新花头害民卖国
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】正当蒋管区物价飞涨，各地市场日益呈现着混乱与不安的时候，所谓“货币改革”的问题广泛的流传于京沪各地，蒋匪政府并派遣了大买办贝祖诒前去美国与美政府讨论“最有效的援助形式”，据说贝氏携有“有关货币改革的计划”。新华社记者评称：早在去年蒋匪政府即通过黄元彬（蒋匪全国经济委员会委员），不断的宣传其所谓“货币改革计划”。黄象做梦似的说，只要按照他的“货币改革计划，便将使得外汇稳定，物价稳定。最近蒋匪政府大小官员，包括蒋介石、孙科在内，也都照样宣传起来。这说明了：第一、蒋匪政府的经济危机已到了无可救药的地步，蒋币已实在很难继续维持下去；第二、过去一年中蒋匪政府一连串的“紧急措施”完全破产。
    蒋匪政府要办“货币改革”，决非为着“稳定物价”，而是更大规模掠夺蒋区人民的新阴谋。这个阴谋的实现，就将使得蒋管区人民现所持有蒋币的价值化为乌有，从而蒋管区人民手中一点少得可怜的生活资料更加集中于四大家族之手，俾从事内战以延缓其最后崩溃的命运。另一方面，所谓“货币改革计划”，又包含着一个新的卖国阴谋，蒋匪政府提出这个题目，为的是向美国要求贷款，而美帝国主义者所要的却是中国主权。大买办贝祖诒赴美的任务就是去谈判卖国条件。据合众社一月十四日电：“美国务院正经由半官方路线”，但主要的还经由非正式的方面——经由南京及华盛顿的高级人士“秘密”的提出条件，美国务院将在这个基础上同意“向国会要求拨款”。这个消息暴露出新的卖国谈判已在蒋美之间秘密进行，需要全国人民起来反对，并须号召美国人民与中国人民一道制止美国政府这种援蒋内战、破坏中美人民和平友谊的反动行为。
