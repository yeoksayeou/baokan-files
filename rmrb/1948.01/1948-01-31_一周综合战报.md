　　Weekly Comprehensive War Report

　　Weekly Comprehensive War Report from January 22nd to 28th:

　　Northern Front: The Jinchaji Military Region, in coordination with the Northeast People's Liberation Army's winter offensive, launched a large-scale sabotage campaign against the Ping-Sui, Ping-Han, Bei-Ning, and Jin-Pu Railways around the New Year. They destroyed approximately 400 miles of railway, cutting off transportation between the key areas of the Chiang bandits in North China: Beiping, Tianjin, Baoding, and Zhangjiakou. This also dealt a serious blow to the Fu bandits, whom Chiang relied on as his Great Wall. On the 7th and 8th, the People's Liberation Army blocked the main forces of the Chiang bandits' Provisional 3rd, 16th, 35th, and 94th Armies, who were moving south to relieve Baoding, on the west side of the Ping-Bao Line, killing and wounding over 4,000 of them. On the 12th, in Zhuang and along the North and South Yi'an line east of Laishui, the PLA annihilated over 2,000 men of the New 32nd Division of the Fu bandits' 35th Army, which was attempting to relieve the siege of Laishui. Army Commander Lu Yinglin and Division Commander Li Mingding were both killed. Its 101st Division was also ambushed in Wucun, ten miles northwest of Dingxing, where over 600 were killed or captured. Additionally, the Jin 17th Division, which had rushed from the Ping-Sui Railway to reinforce, was killed or wounded by 500 men near Songlin Store. On the 13th, another group of approximately one regiment from the Provisional 11th Division of the Fu bandits' Provisional 3rd Army was completely annihilated along the Dashi Ridge to Zhunwan line, about forty miles east of Yongning, eliminating over 1,800 bandits. Thus, since the bandit leader Fu Zuoyi took office as "Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in North China," his so-called "proactive tactics," which he clamored for, were declared bankrupt with a loss of nearly 9,000 men, and the 35th Army, on which the Fu bandits relied for their rise, also suffered a heavy annihilating blow. Although the Chiang bandits' Central News Agency weakly boasted of a "great victory at Laishui," the "Memorial Service for Lu Yinglin and Li Mingding" held in Zhangyuan became a stark irony of this "victory."
　　
　　After the great victory in the sabotage campaign on the northern front, the Jinchaji Military Region launched an offensive operation towards the north of the Daqing River on the 18th, and recaptured the city of Xiongxian, northeast of Baoding, that evening. On the 19th, they continued to advance northeast and recaptured many villages and towns such as Jiugang (twenty miles northeast of Xiongxian), Kaikou (fifteen miles west of Xinzhen), Niutuo (twenty miles southwest of Yongqing), and Chaheji (ten miles west of Baxian). On the 21st, they successively recovered Baxian city. Now, the vast area north of the Daqing River, east to Anci and Shengfang, west to the east bank of the Daqing River, north to the south bank of the Yongding River, and south to Xiongxian and Xinzhen, has been liberated again.

　　The Jidong Military Region continued to sabotage the Bei-Ning Railway. On the 13th, 15th, and 17th, three sections of the railway between Tangfang and Lutai were destroyed. On the 17th, our local corps severely attacked a regiment of the Chiang bandits' 92nd Army 56th Division, which attempted to reinforce the Northeast, near Shengtieying, fifteen miles east of Liushouying, annihilating and capturing over 600 men below the battalion commander. Another unit of ours stormed Ying Shouyingzi, fifty miles north of Xinglong, on the morning of the 19th, eliminating over 130 bandits.

　　Southern Front: The main force of the People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the local armed forces, rounded up and suppressed Chiang bandits, captured local bullies, and recovered many towns and strongholds. On the 17th, the Yu-Shaan-E People's Liberation Army captured Xiangcheng for the third time, capturing over 30 Chiang bandits. On the night of the 18th, they also liberated Yuxian County, northwest of Xuchang, capturing 344 enemy security corps members. In mid-month, our Fourth and Fifth Military Sub-districts successively annihilated and captured over 300 men, including Lieutenant Colonel Li Shunzhen, attached to the Guidance Column of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, in the Qinglong Mountain area bordering Henan and Hubei and in the Wangzhuang area of Linru. On the 20th, the Yu-E-Wan Jianghan Military Region attacked and captured the Tuzhang stronghold of Dongjinwan on the east bank of Xiangyang, killing and capturing 125 enemy security captains and below, threatening Xiangyang and causing the Chiang bandits there to declare martial law. In western Anhui, we swept up Chiang bandits south of Huoshan County earlier this month, killing and capturing over 250 men. On the 15th, our forces around Wuhan ambushed a part of the Chiang bandits' 28th Division on the Xiadian-Xiangbeizui (Lishan) highway. On the same day, another unit captured Bolangdian near Xiangbeizui, killing and capturing a total of 110 Chiang bandits in both battles. On the 13th, the Su-Lu-Yu-Wan People's Liberation Army recaptured Elin City, capturing over 100 local Chiang bandits alive. Fifty-six counties in the Yu-Wan-Su border area have now established democratic regimes. Under the leadership of their highest administrative organ, the Yu-Wan-Su Border Area Administrative Office, the people in the area are enthusiastically carrying out the mass movement of dividing floating wealth and land.

　　On all fronts, our local armed forces, combined with the local people, braved wind, snow, and severe cold to raid and surround the enemy, recovering isolated strongholds. Part of the Shaanxi local armed forces recaptured Fugu County on the 14th, and the enemy in Yulin was completely isolated. On the 18th, they continued to capture Madigou (southwest of Hecheng), defeating two regiments of Qi Zhizhong's Fu bandit security division, annihilating and capturing over 540 enemy battalion commanders and below. The Huaibei local armed forces advanced to the east side of the Jin-Pu Railway, and on the 8th, they raided Gaoji, fifty miles northeast of Lingbi, and on the 10th, they attacked Chantang, eliminating over 170 bandit security captains and below in both battles. On the 14th, the Taihang Militia Guerrilla Detachment defeated over 1,000 bandit-puppet teams who were looting grain in the Majie Village area of Xiuwu. On the same day, they ambushed part of the Yan bandit Security 18th Regiment in the Bianzhuangtou area of Jiexiu. Another unit repelled part of the Yan puppet Eighth Column who were looting grain in Doufuzhuang, Yuci.

　　一周综合战报
    一月二十二日至二十八日一周综合战报：
    北线方面：晋察冀我军配合东北解放军冬季攻势，于新年前后发动对平绥、平汉、北宁、津浦四条铁路的大破击战，破坏铁路全长约四百里，使华北蒋匪要地北平、天津、保定、张家口之间交通断绝，并予蒋匪倚为长城的傅匪以严重打击。解放军于七八两日沿平保线西侧阻击南下救援保定的蒋匪暂三、十六、三十五、及九十四等四个军的主力，杀伤其四千余众。十二日复在涞水城东之庄及南北义安一线，歼灭图解涞水城之围的傅匪三十五军新三十二师两千余人，军长鲁英麟、师长李铭鼎均被击毙。其一○一师亦于定兴西北十里的吴村遭我歼俘其六百余人。另由平绥路赶来增援的晋十七师亦在松林店附近被我毙伤五百余人。十三日又在永宁东约四十里之大石岭至准湾一线，全歼傅匪暂三军暂十一师一部约一个团，歼匪一千八百余名。至此，匪首傅作义就任“华北剿共总司令”以来，叫嚣的所谓“主动战术”，以损兵折将近九千人而宣告破产，而傅匪赖以起家的三十五军也遭到惨重的歼灭性的打击。蒋匪中央社虽有气无力的吹嘘“涞水大捷”，但在张垣召开之“鲁英麟、李铭鼎追悼大会”，恰恰成为此一“胜利”的鲜明的讽刺。
    晋察冀我军于北线破击大捷后，复于十八日向大清河北展开攻势作战，当晚收复保定东北的雄县城。十九日继向东北挺进，收复咎冈（雄县东北二十里）、开口（新镇西十五里）、牛沱（永清西南二十里）、岔河集（霸县西十里）等村镇多处。二十一日相继收复霸县城。现大清河北东至安次、胜芳，西至大清河东岸，北至永定河南岸，南至雄县、新镇之间广大地区重告解放。
    冀东我军继续破击北宁路，十三、十五、十七三日间，毁塘坊至芦台一段铁路三处。十七日我地方兵团在留守营东十五里胜铁营一带痛击企图增援东北的蒋匪九十二军五十六师的一个团，歼俘其营长以下六百余名。我另部十九日晨攻入兴隆北五十里的鹰手营子，歼匪百三十余名。
    南线方面：解放军主力配合地方武装四出兜剿蒋匪，捕捉土顽，收复城镇据点多处。豫陕鄂解放军十七日第三次攻克襄城，俘士蒋匪三十余名。十八日夜又解放许昌西北的禹县县城，俘敌保安团三百四十四名。我四五分区本月中旬在豫鄂交界青龙山地区及临汝王庄地区，先后歼俘蒋匪杂顽西安绥署督导纵队上校支队附李舜真以下三百余名。豫鄂皖江汉军区我军二十日攻克襄阳东岸之东津湾土蒋据点，毙俘守敌保安大队长以下一百二十五人，威逼襄阳，致该地蒋匪宣布戒严。皖西方面本月上旬扫荡霍山县以南地区蒋匪，毙俘二百五十余名。武汉外围我军十五日在夏店向背咀（礼山）公路上伏击蒋匪二十八师一部，同日另部攻克向背咀附近之博郎店，两仗共毙俘蒋匪一百一十人。苏鲁豫皖我军十三日再克鄂陵城，活捉土蒋一百余名。豫皖苏边区现已有五十六个县建立了民主政权，该区人民在其最高行政机关——豫皖苏边区行政公署领导下，正热烈进行分浮财，分土地的群众翻身运动。
    南北各线我地方武装结合当地人民冒风雪严寒，奔袭围困敌人，收复孤立据点。陕北地方武装一部十四日再度收复府谷县城，榆林之敌至此已完全孤立。十八日续克麻地沟（河曲西南），击溃傅匪保安师奇致忠部两个团，歼俘敌营长以下五百四十余名。淮北地方武装挺进津浦路东侧，八日强袭灵璧东北五十里的高集，十日攻打禅堂，两仗共歼灭匪保安大队长以下一百七十余名。太行民兵游击队十四日在修武马界村一带击溃抢粮的匪伪团队千余人，同日在介休卞庄头一带伏击阎匪保安十八团一部，另部在榆次豆腐庄击退抢粮的阎伪第八纵队一部。
