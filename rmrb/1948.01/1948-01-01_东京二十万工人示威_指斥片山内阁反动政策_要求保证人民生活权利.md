Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Tokyo dispatch: The All-Japan Transportation Workers' Union, under the slogan of guaranteeing the people's right to live, launched a large-scale mass rally in Tokyo on the 21st, followed by a grand demonstration. The number of participants reached 150,000 to 200,000. The chairman of the Transportation Workers' Union presided over the meeting. Japanese Communist Party leader Tokuda also attended and gave a speech. In an atmosphere of激愤 (ji fen - intense anger), the conference passed a resolution denouncing the Katayama Socialist Party government for never implementing the socialist policies it proclaimed upon taking office, and the working class has expressed great disappointment with this kind of deception. The resolution continued: Japan's economic crisis is becoming increasingly serious, leading to a total collapse of the national economy. This fact has proven that the reactionary capitalists' construction plans cannot revive the national economy; the only way to complete national construction is to accept the plans proposed by the workers. The resolution emphasized: The nation's workers are fully aware of their great responsibility for national construction, and stated that the task of national construction must be completed based on the principles of people's democracy, including the socialization of industry. The resolution concluded by stating that workers will strive to implement the slogans passed by the conference, including demanding a minimum wage sufficient to maintain a normal life and rescinding the government's recent statement condemning civil servants' "willful" strikes. After the meeting, the masses divided into nine teams to hold demonstrations, one of which was composed of the organizers of the conference, and marched to the Prime Minister's residence, the Diet, the Supreme Court, and other agencies, respectively, to convey the conference resolution to them.
