　　Qinshui Sixth District Loan Group
  　Personally Visits Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers to Issue Loans
    [Our newspaper, Taiyue, 5th dispatch] The method of the Qinshui Sixth District winter production loan group is: to deliver the loans directly to the homes of poor peasants and hired laborers, and help them come up with ideas for production. Comrades from the loan group went to the countryside separately, visiting poor peasants and hired laborers door-to-door to understand their situations. At the home of Wang Xinshan, an old hired laborer in Matoushan, the old couple were initially afraid to borrow because they were afraid they couldn't repay. However, they said that they had never owned a quilt in their lives, and they only exchanged for a new quilt last year by spinning cotton. This winter, they also wanted to get some capital to go to Anze to sell some grain to earn a profit, and explained that they would also be short of grain for two months next spring. At this time, the comrades of the loan group told him to borrow boldly, so he borrowed 20,000 yuan, planning to carry cotton. Tang Jiatai, a poor peasant and hired laborer in Houhe Village, was over fifty years old and had suffered poverty all his life. During the famine years, he herded sheep for people in Fushan and has not returned yet. His wife and a three or four-year-old girl at home were about to run out of food and had no cotton clothes to wear. They wanted to spin cotton but had no money to buy it. When the cotton loan group came to her home and told her that she could get a loan, she immediately said happily: "If I can borrow some money to buy some cotton to spin thread and exchange it for some cloth, and earn some grain, my daughter and I won't starve to death next spring." The comrades of the loan group found the poor peasants and hired laborers to provide loans and did what they said. For example, when the loan group arrived at Handizhuang, five poor peasants and hired laborers wanted to buy some hemp to make some money, but they had no capital. After the loan group discussed it, they first lent them 120,000 yuan. Five days later, they came back and caught up with the distribution. Then, the poor peasants and hired laborers in Houhezhuang also borrowed 30,000 yuan to go to Jincheng for production. In this way, the poor peasants and hired laborers were very happy and believed that the government was really solving their production difficulties.

　　沁水六区贷款组
  　亲访贫雇发贷款
    【本报太岳五日电】沁水六区冬季生产贷款组的办法是：一直到贫雇农家里把贷款送到贫雇农手里，帮他们出主意闹生产。贷款组的同志分头下乡，挨门挨户的到贫雇农家里了解情况，到马头山的一个老雇工王新山家里，老两口开头怕还不起不敢贷，可是说到他两口一辈子没有盖过被子，去年纺花才换了一条新被子，今年冬天还想弄几个本钱到安泽贩些粮食赚着吃，并说明年春天也缺两个月粮食。这时贷款组的同志叫他大胆的贷，他就贷了两万元，准备担棉花。后河村贫雇农唐家太五十多岁了，受了一辈子穷，灾荒年到浮山给人放羊，现在还没回来。老婆和三、四岁的一个女孩在家马上就没吃的，也没穿棉衣裳。想纺花没钱买，棉花贷款组到她家，给她说了能贷款后，她马上高兴的说：“要能贷点款买些花纺线换点布，赚点粮食，我娘们俩明年春天还饿不死。”贷款组的同志找到贫雇农贷款，说到就作到。如贷款组到了韩底庄，五个贫雇农想到长了买一些麻回来赚些钱，没有本钱，贷款组商量以后，就把贷款先借给他们十二万，五天回来，还赶上发放。接着后河庄贫雇农也借了三万到晋城去生产，这样贫雇农很高兴，相信了政府真的解决他们生产上的困难。
