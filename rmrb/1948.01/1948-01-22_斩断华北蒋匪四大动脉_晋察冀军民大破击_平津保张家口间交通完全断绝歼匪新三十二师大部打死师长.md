　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 20th: Belated news: Around the New Year, the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army braved extreme cold and heavy snow to launch a major sabotage campaign simultaneously against the four major arteries of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in North China – the Ping-Han, Bei-Ning, Jin-Pu, and Ping-Sui Railways – annihilating the majority of Fu Zuoyi's 35th Army, New 32nd Division, part of the 101st Division, and one regiment of the Provisional 3rd Army, 12th Division. This campaign began on the night of December 27th. The Liberation Army first completely destroyed approximately 400 li of railway lines on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway from Zhuoxian to Baoding, the Ping-Jin section of the Bei-Ning Railway from Huangcun to Weishanzhuang, the Jin-Pu Railway from Jinghai to Tangguantun, and the Ping-Sui Railway from Shacheng to Qinglongqiao, Nankou to Qinghe, and Julebao to Tianzhen, severing transportation and isolating the bandit-puppet heartlands of Peiping, Tianjin, Baoding, and Zhangjiakou. The destruction of the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, which the bandit-puppets had repaired and reopened for only a few days, was the most thorough, with roadbeds, bridges, rails, and sleepers completely flattened. The Liberation Army re-liberated Caohe Station, Baitapu, Xuheqiao, and Taibaoying on the Ping-Han Railway, Tangguantun, Wulizhuang, Liuhe, and Zhakou on the Jin-Pu Railway, and the important outer strongholds of the bandits on the Ping-Sui Railway, including Gucheng, Yangfang, Xinzhuang, and Baiyangcheng. On the 28th, we annihilated more than 360 of Fu Zuoyi's bandits at Laojuntang, 20 li east of Yanqing City on the Ping-Sui Railway. On the 29th, we killed and wounded more than 500 of Fu Zuoyi's 35th Army, New 32nd Division, at Yangfang, and briefly captured Xiongxian City, 90 li northeast of Baoding. From the 1st to the 11th of this month, the Liberation Army continued its offensive operations. On the 10th, the Liberation Army captured Efang, 20 li south of Fengtai, a key dispatching point on the Bei-Ning Railway, and Jiuzhouzhen, an important stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits about 70 li directly south of Peiping, completely annihilating the 270-plus enemy troops defending it, and routing two regiments of the remnants of the bandit's 92nd Army, 21st Division, which had come to reinforce from Langfang. On the 11th, another unit of the Liberation Army completely annihilated one regiment of the Provisional 3rd Army, Provisional 12th Division, along the Dashiling to Zhunwan line north of the Ping-Sui Railway. On the same day, the Liberation Army on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway launched a fierce attack on Laishui City, immediately occupying the four gates, and annihilating the headquarters of Fu Zuoyi's 35th Army, New 32nd Division, its affiliated mountain artillery company, and the majority of its two subordinate regiments, the 94th and 96th, and part of a howitzer battalion directly under the 35th Army, and part of the 101st Division, at Zhuangcun, more than 10 li east of Laishui City, attempting to rescue Laishui from Dingxing and Gucheng. The commander of the bandit's New 32nd Division, Li Mingding, was killed by our forces in the battle. Detailed battle results are currently being tallied.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Dong, 20th: On the 4th, a certain unit of the Liberation Army launched a major sabotage campaign against the Bei-Ning and Jin-Cheng Railways, annihilating more than 460 enemy troops. Our army, entering the Goubangzi to Jinzhou section, completely annihilated a company of the 184th Division and two traffic police platoons guarding Shishan Station, capturing more than 200 alive and killing more than 80. Another unit of our army, entering the Jin (zhou) - Yi (xian) section, captured Yimatuan Station, annihilating part of the puppet local army's 174th Division, capturing Deputy Battalion Commander Su Jianhui and over 160 others alive, and killing or wounding more than 10, including company commanders. The Chiang bandits stationed at Qinghemen Station in the Fuxin-Yixian section fled south in a panic on the 6th. In the above battles, a total of three 60mm mortars, seven light machine guns, and more than 270 long and short rifles were captured. Shishan, Yangquanzi, and other stations on the Bei-Ning Railway were burned down, three bridges and two water towers were destroyed, and more than 300 rails were dismantled.
