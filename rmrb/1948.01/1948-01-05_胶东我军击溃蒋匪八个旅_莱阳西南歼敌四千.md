　　Our army in Jiaodong completely defeated eight brigades of Chiang Kai-shek bandits who were re-invading Laiyang in the southwest of Laiyang. Pursuing them south for over a hundred li, from December 14th to the end of the month, we annihilated another 4,600 enemy soldiers. Adding to the 3,500+ enemy soldiers annihilated during the previous (December 10th-13th) blocking action, the total annihilation reached 8,100+ enemy soldiers. On the evening of the 4th of last month, when the Liberation Army began to encircle and annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Laiyang city, the bandit chiefs Chiang Kai-shek and Fan Hanjie hastily gathered eight brigades of troops: two brigades from the reorganized 64th Division, all three brigades from the reorganized 54th Division, the 76th Brigade of the reorganized 9th Division, the 42nd Brigade of the Rong 1st Division of the reorganized 8th Army, and the 57th Brigade of the New 74th Division, totaling eight brigades, from Qingdao and Jimo to reinforce northward. They were intercepted by our forces at every step. In the four days from the 10th to the 13th, we annihilated over 3,500 enemy soldiers (as reported previously). When our army captured Laiyang on the evening of the 13th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits reinforcing from the north were still over fifty li away from Laiyang city, held up in the area south of Shuigoutou. On the 14th, our blocking forces, having completed their mission, took the initiative to withdraw from Shuigoutou. At this time, the greedy and cowardly Chiang Kai-shek bandits cautiously passed through the area and ventured north. Except for the 57th and 76th Brigades guarding the traffic line from Lingshan to Shuigoutou, the remaining six brigades, fearing annihilation, crowded together along the way, crawling along under the cover of tanks, airplanes, and howitzers. The Liberation Army continuously struck them, and the enemy only advanced thirty li in ten days, finally crawling to the Taoyuanzhuang line, eighteen li southwest of Laiyang, on the 23rd. For three days, from the 23rd to the 25th, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, under the cover of six tanks, attacked Hejiatuan and Jiangjunding to the east. Two enemy tanks were destroyed by us, and one was captured, along with a tank operator. Our positions stood firm. At this time, another unit of the Liberation Army suddenly inserted itself behind the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on the evening of the 24th, cutting off their traffic line from Lingshan to Shuigoutou in one fell swoop. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits, fearing annihilation by our army, were shaken across the board and turned south to flee in disarray on the 26th, retreating dozens of li in a single day, regardless of the strong winds and heavy snow. On the 28th, our army recovered Shuigoutou and immediately pursued them south. By the 30th, our army had crossed Jiangshanjie (sixty li north of Jimo) and advanced towards Lingshan. At present, there is no trace of the enemy in the vast area north of Lingshan. In total, from the 14th to the end of the month, we continued to annihilate over 4,600 enemy soldiers. Thus, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits reinforcing Laiyang were annihilated by a total of 8,100+ soldiers. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' dream of reoccupying Laiyang under the command of American imperialism has finally been shattered.

　　胶东我军击溃蒋匪八个旅
  　莱阳西南歼敌四千
    【新华社华东前线三日电】解放军在莱阳西南地区完全击溃再犯莱阳蒋匪八个旅，向南追击百余里，自十二月十四日迄月底止，再歼敌四千六百余名。连前（十二月十日至十三日）阻击战中歼敌三千五百余，共歼敌八千一百余名。上月四日晚，当解放军开始围歼莱阳城蒋匪之际，匪首蒋介石、范汉杰即仓皇纠集整六四师两个旅、整五四师全部三个旅及整九师之七六旅、整八军荣一师之四二旅、新七四师之五七旅共八个旅兵力，自青岛、即墨向北增援，当被我节节阻击，十日至十三日四天中，歼敌三千五百余名（已见前报）。当十三日晚我军攻克莱阳时，北援蒋匪尚远离莱阳城五十余里，被阻滞于水沟头以南地区。十四日，我阻击部队以任务已达，乃主动撤离水沟头。此时，贪婪而胆怯的蒋匪，才小心翼翼通过该地向北窜犯。除以五七、七六两旅守备灵山至水沟头一线交通外，其余六个旅惟恐被歼，沿途挤成一团，在坦克、飞机、榴弹炮掩护下，龟步爬行。解放军当予连续打击，敌十日中仅前进三十余里，至二十三日才爬至莱阳西南十八里之桃园庄一线。二十三至二十五日三天，蒋匪以六辆坦克掩护东犯禾家疃及将军顶，被我击毁坦克二辆，缴获一辆，俘坦克手一名，我阵地屹立未动。此时解放军另部已于二十四日晚突然插入蒋匪背后，一举截断其灵山至水沟头的交通，蒋匪惧于我军之歼灭打击，全线震动，乃于二十六日扭头向南回窜，顾不得狂风大雪，一日溃退数十里。二十八日，我军收复水沟头，并即向南跟踪追击，迄三十日，我军已越过姜山集（在即墨北六十里）进迫灵山。现灵山以北广大地区已无敌踪。总计十四日迄月底，我续歼敌四千六百余名。至此，增援莱阳蒋匪共被歼八千一百余名。蒋匪在美帝国主义命令下企图重占莱阳的迷梦，终告粉碎。
