Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 23rd: In the past ten months of the self-defense war, the people of the Border Region have made tremendous contributions to supporting the front. According to incomplete statistics from the four sub-regions of Yanshu, Suide, Longdong, and Sanbian (missing four counties): a total of 843,199 laborers and 715,289 livestock were mobilized, including 20,000 temporary and accompanying stretchers (sporadic mobilization not included). At the beginning of the war, wartime service mobilization lacked strict organization and the work was chaotic, resulting in unfair burdens in some places. It was not until July of last year that the four months of wartime service mobilization work was initially summarized, and the principle of shared labor and wealth was determined, which was supported by poor and lower-middle peasants.

　　Stretcher transport is the main aspect of wartime service mobilization. In the early stages of the war, many areas lacked ideological mobilization and mostly adopted coercive methods. The support teams lacked core leadership, so there were individual cases of desertion. Later, the accompanying stretcher teams were improved. First, cadres were sent to the countryside to conduct ideological mobilization. Each group was equipped with an activist, and county government officials were responsible as the captain and political commissar to establish a leadership core, thus consolidating the organization. Furthermore, due to the army's emphasis on wartime service work, the following achievements and experiences were gained: (1) Army mass work cadres participated in the leadership of the stretcher teams, strengthened ideological education, and respected local cadres, achieving close cooperation. (2) Usually, they are managed centrally, but during wartime they are used in a decentralized manner to reduce waste. (3) Care for the lives of the laborers. During combat, mass work cadres personally take care of the laborers' meals and set up water and food stations for the laborers. (4) Promoting democracy. A mass work cadre of a certain regiment cursed at the laborers during a forced march, but later accepted the laborers' criticism and gained their trust. (5) Paying attention to the safety of the laborers, such as providing timely medical treatment for the laborers and hiding them during wartime to avoid casualties. (6) Commending and rewarding models, such as holding farewell meetings and awarding commendation meetings after the stretcher teams completed their tasks. (7) Promoting the spirit of the people loving the people, mobilizing laborers to help poor people in the驻地（garrison） with production, and strengthening mass discipline. (8) Creating model groups and cultivating model laborers in combat to become the backbone. Sacrifices were given condolences, and a deep friendship was established between the laborers and the troops.

　　十个月爱国自卫战争
  　陕甘宁八十万民工支援前线
    【新华社西北二十三日电】在过去十个月自卫战争中，边区人民对支前贡献了巨大力量，据延属、绥德、陇东与三边四个分区（缺四个县）的不完全统计：共动员民工八十四万三千一百九十九人，牲口七十一万五千二百八十九头，其中临时及随军担架即达两万付。（零星动员尚未计入），战争初期战勤动员缺乏严密组织，工作紊乱，致使在某些地方负担不公，直至去年七月才初步总结了四个月的战勤动员工作，确定劳财共负方针，得到贫雇农拥护。担架运输为战勤动员中主要方面。在战争初期不少地区缺乏思想动员，多采取强迫命令方式，支前队伍缺乏核心领导，因此曾发生个别逃亡现象，后来改进了随军担架队，首先派干部下乡进行思想动员，每组配备一个积极分子，以县府负责干部为大队长、政委，建立领导核心，因之组织巩固。并由于部队重视战勤工作，获得如下成绩及经验：（一）部队民运干部参加担架队的领导，加强思想教育，尊重地方干部，达到密切合作。（二）平时集中管理，战时则分散使用，减少浪费。（三）关心民工生活，战斗时民运干部亲自照料民工的伙食，并为民工设水站、饭站。（四）发扬民主，某团民运干部在急行军中，催促民工骂了两句，后来接受民工批评，获得民工信仰。（五）注意民工安全，如及时为民工治病，战时使其隐蔽，以免伤亡。（六）表功奖模，如在担架队完成任务，开欢送大会，开计功给奖大会。（七）发扬民爱民精神，发动民工帮助驻地贫苦人民生产，加强群众纪律。（八）在战斗中创造模范组，培养模范民工，成为骨干。对牺牲者予以抚衅，民工与部队之间建立了深厚友谊。
