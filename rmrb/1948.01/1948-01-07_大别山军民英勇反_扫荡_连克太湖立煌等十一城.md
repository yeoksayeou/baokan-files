On the 16th, the entire territory of Susong was liberated. At the same time, the troops of our Tongbai and Jianghan Military Regions, west of the Ping-Han Railway, cooperated with the Dabie Mountain anti-"mopping-up" operations and launched offensives in the Tongbai and Jianghan areas. In the Tongbai Military Region: On the evening of the 2nd, four blockhouses were leveled near Liulin, south of Xinyang, and part of the Chiang bandit traffic police team was annihilated.
