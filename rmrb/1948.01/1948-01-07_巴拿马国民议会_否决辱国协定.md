Xinhua News Agency: Under the pressure of unanimous protests and demands from the people of Panama, the Panamanian National Assembly, on the 22nd of last month, resolutely rejected the humiliating treaty signed by the United States and Panama on the 10th regarding the lease of military bases in Panama, delivering a resounding slap to the face of the US imperialists. Upon hearing the news of the rejection, the capital city of Panama erupted in jubilation. Countless masses immediately flooded the streets, dancing and shouting with joy, which quickly transformed into a victorious demonstration of tens of thousands of people. The US imperialists, struck by this blow, were "deeply astonished" and flustered. The State Department and other officials, in a threatening tone, presumptuously referred to this completely legal action by the Panamanian Congress as an "unfortunate event" and a "hostile action," clearly revealing their aggressive fangs. However, in the face of the intense anger of the Panamanian people, the State Department had to retreat and was forced to announce that, starting from the 23rd, it would begin withdrawing its illegally stationed troops in Panama to within the Canal Zone.

　　巴拿马国民议会
  　否决辱国协定
    【新华社讯】巴拿马国民议会，在全国人民一致抗议与要求的压迫下，已于上月二十二日，一致断然否决了美巴两国于十日签订的租借巴国军事基地的辱国协定，给美帝国主义者打了一记清脆的耳光。否决消息传出后，巴京万众欢腾，无数群众立即涌至大街，愉快地舞蹈和狂叫，并立时转化为数万人的胜利示威游行。受此打击的美帝国主义则“至感惊异”，手忙脚乱，国务院及其他官员并以威吓之口吻，妄指巴国会此一完全合法之举为“不幸之事”与“敌对的行动”，明显地露出其侵略者的犬牙。但国务院在巴国人民群情愤激之下，不得不实行退却，并被迫宣布自二十三日起，开始撤退其非法留驻巴国之军队至运河区以内。
