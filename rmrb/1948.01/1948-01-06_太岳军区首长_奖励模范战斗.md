Taiyue Military Region Leaders
　　Reward Model Battles
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch dated 2nd] On New Year's Day, 1948, the leaders of the Taiyue Military Region issued a circular rewarding the model battles of various units throughout the year. In 1947, the military region's troops fought many beautiful battles, eliminating more than 30,000 enemies, and also fought many model battles, receiving commendations from higher authorities. The circular stated: "In 1947, the military region's troops independently organized several relatively large battles, especially the recovery of Yicheng in January and the annihilation of a regiment of Chiang bandit regular troops at Pinglu Temple in July. These were model battles in which local corps were completely concentrated to fight and thoroughly annihilate the enemy. The guerrilla forces in various places either cooperated with the main forces in combat or independently persisted in the struggle against the enemy in their own localities. Most of them took the initiative to actively attack the enemy. Among the guerrilla forces, the Jiexiu Brigade (especially the Third District Detachment), the Linfen Brigade, the Yilin Brigade, and the Anyi and Mengxian Independent Battalions fought the most and the best. They fought flexibly, achieved great results, and had good relations with the masses, which are worthy of everyone's learning. Although the troops of the Fifth Sub-district were in the newly liberated areas of western Henan, where the environment was harsh and there were many bandits, after three months of effort, they eliminated more than 2,000 bandits, and the western Henan sub-district has been consolidated." Finally, it called on everyone to "carry forward this spirit, fight more beautiful battles in 1948, and eliminate more enemies."
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch dated 2nd] The Jiexiu Guerrilla Brigade fought five ambushes in December, all of which were successful, killing a total of 32 Yan bandit soldiers and capturing 3 machine guns and 15 rifles. They did not suffer a single casualty. The leaders of the sub-district and military region have successively issued circulars to commend them, calling on everyone to learn from their spirit of proactive and initiative combat.

　　太岳军区首长
  　奖励模范战斗
    【本报太岳二日电】太岳军区首长，于一九四八年元旦，通令奖励全年各部队的模范战斗。一九四七年中，军区部队打了很多漂亮仗，消灭了三万多敌人，还打了许多模范仗，得到上级表扬。通令中写道：“一九四七年，军区部队单独组织了多次比较大的战斗，特别是一月收复翼城，七月在平陆庙的消灭蒋匪正规军一个团等战斗，都是完全用地方兵团集中作战，彻底消灭敌人的模范战斗；各地游击队或是配合主力作战，或是单独坚持本地的对敌斗争，大部是主动积极的去进攻敌人，游击队里打仗最多的最好的是介休大队（特别是三区分队更好）、临汾大队、猗临大队和安邑、孟县独立营，他们打仗灵活，成绩又大，和群众的关系也好，值得大家学习。五分区部队在豫西新解放区，虽然环境艰苦，土匪很多，可是那里的部队经过三个月的努力，消灭了土匪两千多，豫西分区已经巩固起来。”最后，并号召大家“应发扬这种精神，在一九四八年中，打更多的漂亮仗，消灭更多的敌人。”
    【本报太岳二日电】介休游击大队在十二月里打了五次埋伏，都打胜了，共打死阎匪军三十二人，缴机枪三挺，步枪十五支。自己没有一个伤亡。分区和军区首长，都先后通令表扬，号召大家学习他们这种积极主动的战斗精神。
