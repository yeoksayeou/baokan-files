Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. According to consolidated news from newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek area: The academic community in the Chiang Kai-shek area is carrying out struggles against oppression and hunger. On the 4th of last month, the entire student body of Chongqing University in Sichuan went on strike for a day to protest the illegal arrest of female students Ye Mengjun and Song Misi by Chiang's bandits. On the 24th of last month, first-year students in the judicial groups of Fudan, Hunan, Central, Guangxi, Chaoyang and other public and private universities in the Chiang Kai-shek area went on strike for a week to fight for public funding. Chaoyang students stated: If negotiations are unsuccessful, they will unite with representatives from various universities to petition.

After Chiang's bandits issued banknotes with face values of 100,000, 40,000, and 20,000 last month, prices soared, and the education community in the Tianjin-Beijing area could no longer maintain a minimum standard of living. Professors from Peking University and the private China College both demanded that their salaries be adjusted according to the cost of living index. The joint telegram from the Peking University faculty and staff union stated: "Those with a base salary of 200 yuan (equivalent to 1.2 million yuan in Chiang's currency) earn less than ten yuan before the war. In a few months, public school teachers and staff in the Chiang Kai-shek area will starve to death in their offices and classrooms." The Tianjin Private Middle School Faculty and Staff Association petitioned on the 22nd, demanding the same right to rationed goods as public middle schools. The Beijing Private Middle School Faculty and Staff Association has contacted representatives from Tianjin and will take coordinated action. Furthermore, some private primary and secondary schools in the Tianjin-Beijing area, in order to cope with the rapid depreciation of Chiang's currency, are demanding that students prepay tuition for the next semester, causing endless complaints from parents.

　　反压迫、反饥饿
  　蒋区学生教员到处示威请愿
    【新华社陕北九日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：蒋区学界正进行反压迫反饥饿斗争。上月四日，四川重庆大学全校学生罢课一天，抗议该校女同学叶孟君、宋糜嗣横遭蒋匪非法逮捕。上月二十四日，蒋区复旦、湖南、中央、广西、朝阳等公私立大学司法组一年级学生，为争取公费待遇罢课一周。朝阳学生表示：交涉若无结果，即联合各地大学代表请愿。
    上月十日蒋匪发行票面十万、四万、二万大钞后，物价狂涨，平津教育界已无法维持最低生活。北大及私立中国学院两校教授均要求按照生活指数调整待遇。北大各院校教职员联合会代电中说：“底薪（蒋币）二百元者（按可得蒋币一百二十万元）收入不及战前十元，不出数月，（蒋区）公教人员势将饿毙于办公室与教室中”。天津私立中学教职员联谊会于二十二日请愿，要求与公立中学同样享有配给实物权利。北平私立中学教职员联谊会已派代表与津方取得联系，将协同采取行动。又，平津一部分私立中小学为对付蒋币币值狂跌，要求学生预缴下学期学费，各学生家长叫苦不绝。
