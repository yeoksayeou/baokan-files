　　The Poor Laborers Are Still Starving and Freezing
    Implementing the Land Law is the Only Way to Meet Their Demands
    Eight Poor Laborer Families Cannot Equal One Landlord Family
    [Our News] In areas where land reform has not been thoroughly carried out, hired and poor peasants, rural workers, and all peasants with little or no land are still living in difficult conditions and urgently demand emancipation. The Outline Land Law of China completely meets their demands. The following are their voices and living conditions: Gao Huicheng, a long-term worker in Qianjing Village, Third District of Shahe, who has worked for twenty years, said: "The cadres speak beautifully, but I know the situation in the village. Now the landlords Liu Tian Suo and Liu Bao Gui still have 28 mu of good land, and the Liu Xiaocheng family still has 70 mu of good land, three strings of good courtyards, and two donkeys. Eight of our poor laborer families are not worth one of their families. If it weren't for that, Liu Tian Suo's wife would have shouted in the street that their daughter is worth half a son, and I am worth one and a half sons (referring to getting protection and supplies by marrying a cadre)." Zhang Liran, a poor laborer in Zhangyu Village, said: "If the poor people in our village want to turn over, they still have to kill a fat pig and a fat sheep (meaning: to struggle against Zhang Jingshun, who has been a wealthy man in the village since the Ming Dynasty, now serving as a preferential treatment and resistance committee member, who has 70 mu of land, married two wives, and not only was not struggled against during the land reform but also received fruits, exchanging poor land for good land)." Zhang Heidan said: "This year I came back from Shanxi, and I have no house or land at home. The village distributed four mu of inferior land to me, divided into twelve pieces, which cannot be plowed." An old poor laborer in Zhonggao Village said: "I worked as a long-term worker for more than twenty years and bought two mu of land. I and the landlord jointly dug a well (I invested), and jointly bought a waterwheel. This year, during the struggle, even my half was struggled away." Peng Ni, a poor laborer woman in Liugou Village, her husband starved to death in the famine years, leaving behind three children who survived by begging. Evaluator Geng Yin forced her to marry him, but she refused, so she was not given any fruits.

　　　　Without Cotton Clothes and Quilts, Unable to Go Out to Engage in Production
    In Heshun Tuanbi, Gaojiazhuang, Qingyangshu, and other nine villages, when the district arranged for winter production, it was found that many poor laborers and poor people had no quilts to cover and no cotton clothes to wear, and they could not go out at all. How could there be any winter production? The district cadres later went to the villages to investigate household by household and immediately found that more than 80 poor labor families had no cotton clothes and could not go out. Production funds were even more out of the question. The reason for the incomplete emancipation is that the landlords were not overthrown. During winter production, some bad cadres in the villages even lent money to those who were struggled against to open small shops. In Gaojiazhuang Village, 80,000 yuan was loaned, and middle peasants got half of it. The same situation exists in Xiyang. In Xipingyuan, Third District, poor laborer women automatically requested to spin and weave for the change of seasons, but they had no money and could not buy cotton. Now many women have not put on cotton clothes. The landlords and rich peasants are watching and making sarcastic remarks. For example, the rich peasant Tian Hu Niang落奚落 taunted the wife of poor laborer Wei Cun, saying: "You have turned over, got fruits and learned to spin and weave, but you can't even wear clothes. I was struggled against, but I wear new clothes. Even if you get things that are not your own, you can't hold on to wealth." Tian Chuan Zhao Xiyun said: "I am a widow and used to beg for seven or eight years. Now I am considered a human being, but I am still afraid of people. The women's association secretary and deputy secretary in our village are both big landlords of Hongshui. They only teach 'feudalism' when they engage in spinning and weaving. I wanted to learn, but they pushed me out. How can you not be angry? Later, when I went, they scolded me, saying: 'Society is elevating you now. You just picked up your beggar's shoes and you are a decent person.' I was so angry that I trembled all over, but I didn't dare to raise any objections in the past."

　　　　About to Starve
    Gaoyi County is a county with relatively more paddy fields. Although the harvest this year is not as good as in previous years, it is still stronger than counties like Lincheng and Zanhuang. The cadres have a blind optimism. This time, we investigated the lives of poor laborers and poor peasants in five villages: Dafuzhuang, Xiguan, Wangcun, Zhonghan, and Beijiao. We found that among the 324 households and 1,209 poor laborers in the five villages, 80 households and 286 people had no food at all. Only 56 households and 194 people could eat until February, only 50 households and 194 people could eat until March, 124 households and 508 people could eat until the wheat harvest, and only 14 households and 27 people could eat until autumn. Among the poor laborers in the five villages, only more than two out of every 100 people can eat until autumn.
    We have published the voices of poor laborers separately from the contributions of our correspondents in order to help everyone more clearly understand the living conditions and demands of poor laborers. Many of our comrades shout "rely on poor laborers" and "poor laborer concept" every day, but they have never really lived with poor laborers, never had a heart-to-heart talk with them. They shout "take poor laborers as the backbone for winter production" every day, but the cooperatives and mutual aid groups are controlled by landlords and rich peasants, and the loans are still in their hands. How can poor laborers become the backbone? Lending to poor laborers in Xijiao Village, Pingle, should be right, but the poor laborers have not turned over. They say, "I am worried about not being able to repay the loans I used to take out. How can I borrow this time?" Therefore, without understanding the specific demands of hired and poor peasants, it is impossible to regard relying on hired and poor peasants, rural workers, and all peasants with little or no land as the fundamental class line, and of course, it is impossible to deeply understand the basic spirit of the Outline Land Law of China. We hope that comrades in various places will be spokespersons for hired and poor peasants and write about their lives and demands so that we can better serve hired and poor peasants.

### 贫雇仍在挨饿受冻  执行土地法才能满足他们的要求  八个贫雇家换不了一个地主家

　　贫雇仍在挨饿受冻
    执行土地法才能满足他们的要求 
    八个贫雇家换不了一个地主家
    【本报消息】土地改革做得不彻底的地方，雇贫农、乡村工人及一切少地无地的农民到现在生活都很困难，迫切要求翻身，中国共产党土地法大纲完全符合他们的要求，下面是他们的呼声和生活状况：沙河三区浅井村做过二十年活的长工高会成说：“干部们说的漂亮，全村情形俺知道，现在地主刘田锁、刘保贵还有二十八亩好地，刘小成家还有七十亩好地，三串好院子，两头驴，我们贫雇八户换人家一户，地主也是不换的，要不是那样，人家刘田锁老婆就在街上大喊了说，人家一个闺女半个儿，我是一个闺女一个半儿（指嫁给干部得到了掩护和供给）。”张峪村贫雇张立然说：俺村穷人要想翻身还得杀个肥猪肥羊（意思是说：要斗争该村从明朝以来就是财主的张景顺，现当优抗委员，他有七十亩地，娶两个老婆，在土地改革中不但没斗还分了果实，把赖地换成了好地）。张黑旦说：“今年我从山西回来，家中没房、没地，村上分给我四亩劣地，共十二块，不能犁。”中高村一个贫雇老汉说：“我做了二十多年长工买了二亩地，我和地主伙打了一眼井（我入人股），伙买了个水车，今年斗争时，连我那一半也斗走了。”柳沟村贫雇妇女彭妮，男人在灾荒年饿死了，留下三个孩子要饭活过来。评议员庚银的强迫和她结婚，她不愿意，就没有给她分任何果实。
    　　　　没有棉衣被无法出门闹生产
    和顺团壁、郜家庄、青杨树等九村，在区里布置下冬季生产时，发现有不少的贫雇穷人没有被子盖，没有棉衣穿，根本出不了门，那里能搞什么冬季生产？区干部后来到村里挨户调查，一下子就发现了有八十多家贫雇没棉衣不能出门，生产资金更谈不上了。翻身不彻底是由于地主没打倒，在冬季生产中村里一些坏干部竟把款贷给被斗户开小铺。郜家庄一村贷款八万元，中农就贷了一半。昔阳也有同样情形，三区西平原贫雇妇女自动要求纺织换季，可是没有钱，买不来棉花，现在有不少妇女没穿上棉衣，地主、富农在旁边看着说风凉话，譬如富农田虎娘落奚落贫雇魏存的老婆说：“你可翻了身啦，又得果实又学纺织，连衣裳也穿不上，我倒挨了斗争啦，穿的是新衣裳，不是自己的东西，得到手里也福不住财。”田川赵喜云说：“我是个寡妇，过去要饭七、八年，现在才算成了人，可是现在还怕人家。俺村妇女会正副秘书都是洪水的大地主，人家搞纺织，净教给“封建”，我想去学，人家把我推出来，你看气人不气人。后来去了，她们骂我说：“现在社会抬高你啦，刚揪起讨饭鞋后跟，就是正经人，气得我混身打颤，过去也不敢提意见”。
    　　　　马上就要挨饿
    高邑县是一个水地比较多的县份，今年收成虽不比往年，但比起临城、赞皇等县还是强的。干部们都存在着盲目的乐观情绪，这次调查了大夫庄、西关、王村、中韩、北焦等五村的贫雇农过的光景，发现五个村，三百二十四户，一千二百零九人的贫雇中；当下没吃的就有八十户、二百八十六人，能吃到二月的只五十六户一百九十四人，能吃到三月的只五十户共一百九十四人，能吃到麦收的一百二十四户五百零八人，能吃到秋天的只有十四户二十七人，五个村贫雇中一百个人中只有两个多人能吃到秋天。
    我们从通讯员来稿中把贫雇农民的呼声单独的发表了，为的是帮助大家更清醒的认识贫雇的生活状况和要求，我们有不少同志嘴上天天喊“依靠贫雇”，“贫雇观念”，但从来没有真正同贫雇农民生活在一起，没有谈过一次知心话，天天喊：“以贫雇为骨干进行冬季生产”，可是，合作社、互助组被地主、富农把持了，贷款还掌握在人家手里，贫雇农又如何能成为骨干呢？平定西郊村贷款给贫雇，这应该是对的了吧，可是贫雇农没有翻身，他们说：“以前贷用的款，我都正发愁还不了啦，这次怎能贷？”所以，不了解雇贫农切身的要求，就不可能把依靠雇贫农乡村工人及一切少地无地农民当做根本的阶级路线，当然也就不会深刻地认识中国土地法大纲的基本精神。我们希望各地同志做雇贫农的代言人，写出他们的生活和要求，以便我们更好的为雇贫农服务。
