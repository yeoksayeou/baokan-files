　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Cabinet's regular meeting on the 9th decided that the banks of the Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda zaibatsu would not be included in the scope of the "Economic Decentralization Law." The Japanese Minister of Finance stated, "The Japanese government fears that the collapse of such powerful banks would hinder Japan's economic recovery plan." A Xinhua News Agency reporter recently commented on this:
　　The Japanese Cabinet clearly passed this decision under the instruction of MacArthur. This extremely reactionary decision nakedly exposes the shameful collusion between MacArthur and the Japanese zaibatsu, and also exposes that the purpose of the so-called "Japanese economic recovery plan" is primarily to restore the economic power of the Japanese fascist zaibatsu. Such a policy is a consistent policy of the American reactionaries. As early as last December, Republican Congressman Nolan of the United States clamored loudly, saying, "The policy of eliminating excessive concentration of economic power in Japan is excessive and socialistic."
　　The Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda banks are the nerve centers of Japan's four major zaibatsu. Through them and their affiliated companies, the four major zaibatsu control 70 percent of Japan's industry, the vast majority of import and export trade, and the majority of national savings. Their role in Japan is equivalent to that of Rockefeller's, Morgan's Chase (Citibank), Citibank, and Guarantee Trust Company in the United States. Today's announcement that they will not be included in the economic decentralization bill is an open declaration to continue maintaining the rule of the four major zaibatsu. It is already evident that the four major zaibatsu were the pillars of Japan's past wars of aggression. Mitsui Mining, Nippon Steel (Mitsui), Tokyo Shibaura Electric (Mitsui), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Nippon Yusen (Mitsubishi), Mitsubishi Steel, Mitsubishi Chemical, Sumitomo Metal, Sumitomo Communications, Sumitomo Chemical and other top ten Japanese companies, have always been supporters of Japanese wars. They dominated the so-called six major wartime key industries in Japan's military industry, such as aircraft, ships, steel, chemicals, coal, and light metals, and obtained huge profits. In addition, Ginjiro Fujiwara, managing director of Mitsui Oji Paper, served as an advisor to the Tojo Cabinet and Minister of Munitions in the Koiso Cabinet; Kiyoshi Gōko, president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, served as an advisor to the Tojo Cabinet; and Masatsune Ogura, director of Sumitomo Gomei Kaisha, served as the top economic advisor to the Japanese stationed in the puppet state of Manchukuo. Today, these facts of heinous crimes are still vivid in our minds, and the blood of the martyrs who died for human justice and peace in World War II is not yet dry. The above-mentioned war criminals, although once arrested, have all been released. MacArthur, who is the representative of the Allied control of Japan, and Congressman Nolan and others have gone even further, frantically and openly tearing up the Potsdam Declaration, making people see more clearly the true colors of these war mongers. What they want to protect is not human justice and peace at all, but the money in the pockets of a few financial giants. If the four major Japanese zaibatsu were really dissolved, wouldn't the huge investments of Morgan's General Electric, Mellon's Westinghouse Electric, Rockefeller's Standard Oil, DuPont, and German chemical trusts in the electrical, military, and chemical enterprises operated by Mitsui and Mitsubishi be reduced to nothing?

### 战争贩子面目暴露得更清楚了　美帝勾结日本四大财阀  想恢复法西斯经济力量

　　战争贩子面目暴露得更清楚了
  　美帝勾结日本四大财阀  想恢复法西斯经济力量
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】东京讯：日内阁九日常会决定三井、三菱、住友、安田四大财阀银行不列于“经济分散法”范围之内。日藏相谈称：“日本政府因恐此种有力银行之倒闭，妨害日本之经济复原计划。”新华社记者顷就此评称：
    日内阁显然是在麦克阿瑟授意之下通过此一决定的。这个极端反动的决定，赤裸裸的暴露了麦克阿瑟与日本财阀的可耻的勾结，也暴露了所谓“日本经济复原计划”的目的，是首先在于恢复日本法西斯财阀的经济力量。这样的政策，乃是美国反动派一贯的政策。早在去年十二月，美共和党议员诺兰就曾高声叫嚣说：“消灭日本经济过度集中现象的政策，是过火的与社会主义的。”
    三井、三菱、住友、安田四大银行，是日本四大财阀的神经中枢。通过它们及其附属公司，四大财阀控制了日本工业的百分之七十，输出入贸易的绝大部分与国民储蓄的大部分。其在日本国内的作用，相当于洛克菲勒、摩根的大通（柴氏）银行、花旗银行与保证信托银行之于美国。今天宣布其不列入于经济分散法案之内，就是公开声明继续维持四大财阀的统治。而四大财阀之为日本历次侵略战争之支柱，已有目共睹。三井矿山、日本制钢（三井）、东京芝浦电气（三井）、三菱重工业、日本邮船（三菱）、三菱制钢、三菱化学、住友金属、住友通讯、住友化学等日本十大公司，一直是日本战争的支持者，它们支配着日本军需工业中飞机、船舶、钢铁、化学、石炭、轻金属等所谓战时六大重点工业，并获得巨额利润。此外，三井王子制纸会社常务理事藤原银次郎，曾任东条内阁顾问、小矶内阁军需大臣，三菱重工业会社社长乡古洁，曾任东条内阁顾问，住友合资会社理事长小仓正恒，曾任日本驻伪宁最高经济顾问。今天这些罪恶昭彰的事实犹历历在目，第二次大战中为人类的正义与和平而死去的烈士们，犹血迹未干。上述战犯虽经一度逮捕，都已全部释放。身为盟国管制日本代表的麦克阿瑟与国会议员诺兰之流，更进而丧心病狂地公开撕毁波茨顿宣言，使人们更看清楚了这批战争贩子的真面目。他们要的保卫本来就不是人类的正义和平，而是少数金融巨头口袋里的钱财。如果日本四大财团真的解散，那末摩根集团的通用电气公司、梅隆的集团威斯汀豪斯电气公司、洛克菲勒的美孚油公司、杜邦公司、德国化学托辣斯等在三井、三菱所经营的电气军火化学等企业中的巨额投资，不是化为乌有了？
