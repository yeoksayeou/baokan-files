Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 13th: The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters has just released Operations Communiqué No. 20, announcing the complete annihilation of the enemy's 195th Division and 43rd Division, two entire divisions, and the details and results of the annihilation of the New 5th Army headquarters, stating:

During the winter offensive, our army captured Zhangwu, completely annihilated the enemy's 79th Division and one regiment of the 207th Division, and routed the Provisional 59th Division, the 10th Cavalry Brigade, and other units. We also completely surrounded the enemy's Provisional 62nd Division of the New 6th Army in Faku, directly threatening Shenyang. The bandit leader Chen Cheng then hastily transferred the entire New 1st Army and more than two divisions of the 71st Army from Changchun to reinforce the south. By the end of last year, within a circle centered on Shenyang with a radius of one hundred li, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits had amassed half of their Northeast regular army, totaling 29 divisions, and 15 divisions of local troops, for a total force of 44 divisions. The majority of these forces, namely: the entire New 1st Army and New 3rd Army, totaling six divisions; the 195th and 43rd divisions of the New 5th Army; the New 22nd and 169th divisions of the New 6th Army; the 130th Division of the 53rd Army; the 87th and 91st divisions of the 71st Army; one regiment of the 88th Division; two regiments of the 207th Division; the Provisional 55th Division, and others, totaling 15 divisions, were deployed along the banks of the Liao River on a front of just over two hundred li between Xinmin in the northwest of Shenyang and Tieling. Starting on New Year's Day, they advanced westward and northward in a fan shape at a slow, steady pace, attempting to drive away our army, thereby ensuring the safety of Shenyang and further relieving the siege of Faku. When the enemy's left wing advanced northward to the vicinity of Gongzhutun (forty li northeast of Xinmin), our powerful army corps, with the force of thunder, cleaved through the dense enemy阵地 starting on the 5th of this month, wedging into the side and rear of the enemy's left wing from the northeast suburbs of Xinmin and Liaobinta northeast of the city, completing the pincer encirclement of the 195th Division and 43rd Division of the New 5th Army. The remaining enemies, no longer daring to attempt to relieve Faku, hurriedly reinforced the Gongzhutun direction to the west. Our army corps responsible for blocking rose up to block the reinforcing enemy. From then on, a large-scale annihilation battle and blocking battle unfolded fiercely outside the bandit nest of Shenyang. Starting at 14:00 on the 5th, our army launched a general offensive against the surrounded enemy. In an area of over one hundred li, from Gongzhutun in the north to the near suburbs of Xinmin in the south, our army, with high morale, braved the extreme cold of Guanwai, treading on ice and snow, sweeping across the area, using intense firepower to fight for every village and house, destroying the enemy's stubborn resistance, dividing them one by one, and successively annihilating the bandit troops in Anfutun, Qianhou Wenjiatai, Huangjiashan, and other places. By 20:00 on the 7th, after a total of 54 hours of fierce fighting, the entire unit was finally wiped out. At the same time, our army corps responsible for blocking, in a protruding arc-shaped area thirty li wide and one hundred and sixty li long from Shenyang to Shifosi, north of Shenyang, and west of the highway, blocked the entire three divisions of the New 3rd Army, the New 28th and 169th divisions of the New 6th Army, the New 30th Division of the New 1st Army, the 87th and 91st divisions of the 71st Army, the Provisional 55th Division of the 49th Army, and the 2nd Division of the 52nd Army (coming to reinforce from Shenyang), totaling more than ten divisions. Under the bombardment of enemy aircraft, tanks, and fierce artillery fire, our soldiers bravely charged forward, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, repeatedly fighting for every ice-covered and snow-covered terrain and feature, resolutely forcing the enemy, several times our number, to stop at the predetermined blocking positions, failing to cross our lines even a step, and killing and wounding more than 4,000 of them, enabling our army to smoothly carry out the encirclement and annihilation of the New 5th Army headquarters and the 195th and 43rd divisions, making a great contribution. The results of this battle are now announced as follows:

    (1) A total of over 16,000 officers and soldiers of the New 5th Army headquarters and the 195th and 43rd divisions were killed, wounded, or captured, including the death of Chen Hualong, deputy division commander of the 43rd Division, and the killing and wounding of over 4,000 officers and soldiers of the aforementioned units. The following enemy personnel were captured alive: Xie Daizheng, division commander of the 195th Division; Miao Guangtian, division commander of the 43rd Division; Chen Shijie, chief of staff of the 195th Division; Yi Xiyin, chief of staff of the 43rd Division; Zhou Zhenyu, commander of the 583rd Regiment; Zhang Genwen, commander of the 584th Regiment; Li Zhongxi, commander of the 585th Regiment; Ding Bolin, commander of the 128th Regiment; and over 12,000 other officers and soldiers.

    (2) Captured: 2 heavy artillery pieces, 4 field guns, 7 mountain guns, 8 infantry guns, 5 chemical mortars, 43 mortars, 13 rocket launchers, 142 60mm mortars, 70 grenade launchers, 121 heavy machine guns, 647 light machine guns, 952 submachine guns, 5,374 various guns, 2,192,158 rounds of various bullets, 9,185 rounds of various artillery shells, 13 radio stations, 3 automobiles, and 1,409 mules and horses.
