Xinhua News Agency, Front Line of Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui, 17th. General Su Yu delivered Chairman Mao's report at a cadre meeting of directly subordinate units in a certain area on the front line on the afternoon of the 12th, calling on the entire army to study it in depth in connection with reality, and at the same time summed up the achievements of the East China People's Liberation Army in the past year. He said: In the past year, we have annihilated 300,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits. If we add the achievements of the East Line Corps, the Central China People's Liberation Army, and the East China Local Armed Forces after August, we have annihilated at least more than 400,000 enemies. This is the result of the joint struggle of the entire party, government, army and people under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Our army is six times stronger than it was a year ago, and we have captured a large number of enemy weapons in battles, which has improved our equipment. Our artillery has become fifteen times stronger in the past year. In recent battles, we have effectively eliminated the enemy with a large number of automatic weapons such as Thompson submachine guns, carbines, and submachine guns. Now our army has all the new weapons of the enemy, and can use them skillfully. Combat technology has been greatly improved, especially after the merit campaign, land reform study, and grievance campaign, the class consciousness has been greatly improved. When talking about the changes in the East China war situation in the past year, General Su Yu said: "After a year of hard fighting in Shandong in the first half of last year, our army finally smashed Chiang Kai-shek's 'key offensive' of 600,000 to 700,000 troops, and enabled our army to switch to a strategic counter-offensive. We have not only defended the basic areas of East China, restored the vast areas of central Shandong, southern Shandong, Binhai, Jiaodong, southwestern Shandong and central China, but also opened up the new liberated areas of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan and Anhui, and connected them with the two major liberated areas of Hubei-Henan-Anhui and Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei." Finally, he asked the entire army to continue to work hard, overcome its own weaknesses, and complete six major tasks: (1) Annihilate a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's regular and local troops. (2) Extensively mobilize the masses to build and consolidate the new liberated areas of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan and Anhui. The entire army should regard doing a good job in mass work as equally important as combat. Even in a certain period, mass work is more important than combat. (3) The entire army is required to complete land reform study for the troops in the near future, and implement the three investigations and three rectifications - investigate class, investigate ideology, investigate work, rectify organization, rectify discipline, and rectify system. In order to consolidate and strengthen the combat effectiveness of our army, so that every commander and fighter can wholeheartedly fight for the complete liberation of the Chinese people. (4) Oppose localism, remaining sectarianism and mountain-stronghold mentality. (5) Advocate the style of hard work and simplicity, improve work efficiency, streamline the organs, and strengthen the company. (6) Improve military technology, especially learn to attack fortifications, in order to usher in a greater victory in 1948.

　　粟裕将军
  　传达毛主席报告
  　号召全军完成六大任务
    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线十七日电】粟裕将军于十二日下午在前线某地直属队干部大会上传达毛主席报告，号召全军联系实际，深入学习，并同时总结华东解放军一年来战绩。他说：我们在过去一年中歼灭了蒋匪三十万人，如果加上八月以后东线兵团、华中解放军及华东地方武装的战绩则至少歼敌四十万以上，这是全体党政军民在毛主席领导下共同奋斗的结果。我军较去年今日壮大了六倍，而且在战斗中大量的缴获了敌人的武器，改善了我们的装备。我军炮兵一年来就强大了十五倍。在最近的战斗中，我们已经以大量的汤姆枪、卡宾枪、手提冲锋枪等自动火器有效的消灭敌人。现在敌人所有的新式武器，我军都有了，而且能熟练的使用它。战斗技术大大提高，特别是经过立功运动，土地改革学习，诉苦运动之后，阶级觉悟大大提高。粟裕将军于讲到一年来华东战局的变化时称：“我军经过去年上半年在山东艰苦奋战，终于粉碎了蒋介石六七十万军队的‘重点进攻’，并使我军转入了战略反攻。我们不但保卫了华东的基本地区，恢复了鲁中、鲁南、滨海、胶东、鲁西南及华中的广大地区，而且开辟了苏鲁豫皖新解放区，与鄂豫皖、豫陕鄂两大解放区连成了一片”。最后，他要求全军继续努力，克服自己的弱点，完成六大任务：（一）大量歼灭蒋匪正规军与地方军。（二）广泛发动群众，建设与巩固苏鲁豫皖新解放区，全军应把做好群众工作与作战当作同等重要的任务。甚至在某一时期，群众工作比作战还更重要。（三）全军要求最近期间完成部队土地改革学习，实行三查、三整——查阶级、查思想、查工作，整组织、整纪律、整制度。以巩固和加强我军战斗力，使每个指战员都能全心全意的为中国人民的彻底解放而奋斗到底。（四）反对本位主义、残存的宗派主义与山头主义。（五）提倡艰苦朴素的作风，提高工作效率，精简机关，加强连队。（六）提高军事技术尤其要学习攻坚，以迎接一九四八年更伟大的胜利。
