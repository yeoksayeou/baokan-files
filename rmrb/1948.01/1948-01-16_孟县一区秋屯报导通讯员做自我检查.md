　　[Taiyue News] Wang Shouzhi, a correspondent from Qiutun in the first district of Meng County, who was a "leading employer of the poor," made a self-criticism on December 30th of last year regarding his speculative thinking and "armchair strategist" style. He said: When I read the article in the No. 5 newspaper about the leading cadres in the first district of Meng County lacking a class viewpoint and harming the hired and poor peasants in Qiutun, I was very unhappy and my attitude was not calm. Later, after reviewing the situation, I realized that I had the following shortcomings in my writing: (1) My starting point at the time was to rush, for example, when I mentioned "leading employer of the poor," the leaders of the first district did not mention this matter; they mentioned "leading cadres." (2) I did not conduct in-depth investigations. The facts I reported were based solely on reports from a few comrades and village cadres, which I treated as valuable material and wrote into news, resulting in detachment from reality. Some things were only superficially understood, and the writing was incomplete. For example, the three households in Xizhen, including Tang Jiu Suo, handing in public grain, was only mentioned, not produced, but I distorted the facts in my reporting. (3) I lacked a class viewpoint in viewing the problems. For example, Zhang Lanying from Nanzhen handed in ten kilograms of public grain, and the women pushed the mill to grind public grain. This was originally the leadership forcing the poor peasants to hand in public grain. I did not think about how they would live after handing in the public grain and praised them in general terms. This is a lack of class viewpoint in understanding the issue and a failure to start from the immediate interests of the hired and poor peasants. My review is like this, but it is still not profound enough. I hope everyone will offer more suggestions so that I can make greater progress in my writing in the future, and only in this way can I progress.

　　孟县一区秋屯报导通讯员做自我检查
    【太岳消息】表扬孟县一区秋屯中“雇贫带头”的通讯员王守智同志在去年十二月三十日，对他的投机思想和“客里空”作风做了自我批评。他说：五号报上登出孟县一区领导干部缺乏阶级观点，秋屯中伤害了雇贫农。当时我看了这个稿子，心里很不高兴，态度也不冷静。后来经过检讨，我才认识到自己在写稿当中有这样几个缺点：（一）当时出发点是为了赶时间，如我提的“雇贫带头”，一区领导上并没有提这回事，他们提的是“干部带头”。（二）不做深入的调查，我报导的事实光是听了几个同志和村干部的汇报，就当成可贵材料，写成新闻，结果脱离了实际。有些事情只是皮毛的了解，写的不完全，如西镇汤艽锁等三户交公粮，只是说了，没有出，但自己报导时歪曲了事实。（三）看问题缺乏阶级观点，如南镇张兰英交公粮十斤，妇女们推碾公粮，这本是领导上强迫贫农拿公粮，我没有想想他们出了公粮怎么生活，就笼统表扬。这是认识问题缺乏阶级观点，不能从雇贫切身利益出发。我是这样的检讨了，还很不深刻，希望大家多提意见，以便今后写作上有更大的进步，同时也只有这样才能进步。
