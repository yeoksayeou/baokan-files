　　Landlords Cause Trouble, Village Cadres Monopolize
  　Poor and Hired Peasants in Nan Yanchi Fear Loans

    [Our Dispatch] In the past, loan work in the fourth district of Jize had many problems. Village cadres monopolized everything, and poor and hired peasants who really needed money often could not get loans. This time, in order to break out of the circle of village cadres and thoroughly follow the mass line, district cadres prepared to first create some experience and then extend loans to all villages. District Chief Qin and eight others went to Nan Yanchi Village and went down separately to understand the situation and opinions of poor peasant households. At that time, the landlords took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying, "There will be struggles again, investigating bad people..." Some poor peasants barricaded their doors, and some locked their doors, unwilling to let the cadres go to their homes. When Li Wentai's father saw a cadre turn into the alley leading to his house, he ran home from the side, saying to his wife, "Hurry out, the cadre is coming to our house, isn't it an investigation? You hurry out." His wife locked the door and went out in a panic. District Chief Qin went to the home of Zao Lan Niang, the poorest, and stated that our attitude towards loans was to help poor peasants with their difficulties and engage in sideline production. Zao Lan Niang said, "Loans of grain and money can't reach our hands." The cadre asked, "Why can't they reach you?" She said, "Last spring, I heard that the government was providing loans, so I went to the village chief Zhao Huanzhao and asked him to let me use a little! The village chief said no, you can't use it, you beg for food all day long, you don't have any valuable things at home, what are you going to repay with? I went home and was so angry that I couldn't do anything. I thought: The Eighth Route Army always says to let the poor people stand up, but I can't even use this little money? I found two poor peasants who hadn't received any money and went to District Chief Chen in the district, and the district chief said they could use it and gave me a letter. When I told the village chief about it, the village chief said that I had sued him in the district. He and the militia captain called the three of us to the team headquarters and scolded us severely, and also said they would beat us and hang us, scaring us to death. I dare not use money anymore." She also said, "In the autumn, there were loans again, and I said a thousand good words, and finally used four thousand yuan. A few days ago, the government was collecting money, and after calculating, it was four thousand five hundred yuan including principal and interest. I couldn't pay it back, so the village cadres detained me, and there was no way to do anything. My family only had that door left, and the director took it away, calculated as selling for five thousand yuan. District Chief, don't say any more, I dare not use this loan this time, I'm afraid they will tear down my one and a half small houses again." After the cadres learned about these reflections from the poor and hired peasants, nine people divided into three groups and went deep into the three streets to mobilize the poor peasants and organize poor peasant groups, totaling forty households. A poor peasant meeting was held to expose the rumors and conspiracies of saboteurs, explaining the biases of past loans and that this time it must be loaned to the poor peasants. After the poor people's thinking was cleared, they recognized that the Communist Party was seeking benefits for the poor and allowing the poor to be masters of their own affairs. The poor peasants all made sideline production plans, and the whole village needed a total capital of 774,000 yuan, which solved the difficulties of the poor peasants in sideline production. The village's poor peasant group has been initially organized and is being expanded, and various sideline industries are also being developed. (Zhen An, Jin Bo)

    The situation in Nan Yanchi Village exposes two serious problems: (1) The landlords have not been completely defeated and are still secretly active, spreading rumors and scaring the poor and hired peasants. (2) The village cadres are oppressing the poor and hired peasants, not only not giving them loans, but simply not treating them as human beings. When they can't repay the debt on time, they even take away their doors. It is good that the district cadres went directly to the poor and hired peasants to ask about their difficulties in order to solve their problems. However, is this approach truly relying on the poor and hired peasants and mobilizing the class line of the poor and hired peasants? The news does not make this clear. If the poor and hired peasants are not truly in charge, the landlords can never be defeated, and the cadres cannot be reformed. Enshrinement from top to bottom by district cadres cannot solve the problem.

　　地主捣乱村干包办
  　南砚池贫雇怕贷款
    【本报消息】鸡泽四区过去的贷款工作有好多毛病，村干部包办一切，真正需要钱用的贫雇农往往借不到款。这次贷款为了跳出村干部的圈子，彻底走群众路线，区里干部准备先创造一些经验，再普遍往各村贷。秦区长等九人到了南砚池村，分头深入下去，了解贫农户的情况和意见。当时地主乘机造谣说：“又要斗争哩，调查坏人啦……”贫农有的将门上住，有的将门锁住，都不愿叫干部去他家。李文太父亲见干部往他家那个过道一拐，就从一边大跑着回到家里，对他老婆子说：“赶快出去吧，干部正往咱家走哩，还不是调查吗？你快出去吧。”他老婆子锁住门，慌慌张张的就出去了。秦区长到最穷的皂兰娘家，表明了我们贷款的态度是为了帮助贫农困难，搞副业生产；皂兰娘说：“贷粮贷款使不到咱手里。”干部问：“怎么使不到？”她说：“年时春天我听说政府贷款哩，就去找村长赵焕朝，说叫我少使点吧！村长说不中，你不能使，你成天要饭，家里没有值钱毛，凭啥归还呢？俺回到家气的一点法儿也没有。我又想：八路军成天说叫穷人翻身，使这俩钱就不中？我找了两个没使到钱的贫农，到区里找陈区长，区长说能使，给开了个信。回村给村长一说，村长说俺往区里告他哩。他和民兵队长将俺三人叫到队部里，好训一顿，又说要打呀，吊呀，吓死人。俺是再也不敢使钱了。”她又说：“到秋天又贷款，俺说了好话万千，总算使了四千元。前几天政府收款哩，算了算，连本带利四千五百元。俺还不起，村干就将俺扣起来，没有一点办法了。我家就落了那个门，主任给拆走了，算卖五千元。区长别说了，这次贷款俺可不敢使了，俺怕再将这一间半小平房给拆了。”干部们了解到贫雇这些反映，九个人分成三个组，深入到三道街内发动贫农，组织贫农组，共组织了四十户。开了贫农会，揭发破坏分子的造谣阴谋，说明过去贷款的偏向，这次一定要贷到贫农手里。穷人思想打通后，认清了共产党是为穷人谋利益，叫穷人当家作主。贫农都订出了副业生产计划，全村共需资本七十七万四千元，就解决了贫农在副业中的困难。该村的贫农小组初步组织起来正在扩大中，各样副业亦在开展。（振安、金波）
    南砚池村的情况暴露了两个严重的问题：（一）地主根本没有斗垮，还在暗中活动，大造谣言，吓唬贫雇。（二）村干部压在贫雇头上，不但不给贫雇贷款，简直不把贫雇当人，到期还不了帐，把门都给拿走了。区干部为了解决贫雇的困难，直接深入贫雇访问，这种热情是好的。但是，这种作法真正是依靠贫雇、发动贫雇的阶级路线吗？消息里没有说清楚。贫雇如果没有真正当家，绝不能打倒地主，改造干部。区干部从上而下的恩赐是不能解决问题的。
