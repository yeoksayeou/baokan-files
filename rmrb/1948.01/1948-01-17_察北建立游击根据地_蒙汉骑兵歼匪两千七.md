Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Cha-Re-Liao, 15th. Our correspondent reports that the iron cavalry of the Mongolian and Han people in Chahar North, fighting alongside the Inner Mongolia People's Self-Defense Army for the past year, have galloped across the grasslands and established a guerrilla base in Chahar North. By the end of October, the Chahar North People's Iron Cavalry had fought 168 battles, annihilating 2,758 enemies, seizing 18 machine guns, 728 rifles and pistols, over 40,000 rounds of ammunition, 3,455 warhorses, and a large quantity of other military supplies. They have secured key military locations such as Baimiaotan, Dahulun, Pingdingbao, Dushikou east of Zhangbei, Daliangdi and Daerhao southwest of Duolun, and Datan on the Rehe-Chahar border. They are also constantly active near the cities of Zhangbei, Kangbao, and Baoyuan. Currently, a large area stretching 400 li from near Zhangjiakou to south of Duolun, with a width of 150 li and an area of 60,000 square li, containing a population of 140,000, is under the control of the People's Iron Cavalry. Three democratic county governments have been established in Zhangbei, Baoyuan, and Duolun, along with fifteen district governments. Land reform has been carried out in over 200 villages.
