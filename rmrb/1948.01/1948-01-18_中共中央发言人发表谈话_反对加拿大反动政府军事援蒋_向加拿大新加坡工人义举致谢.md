Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. The spokesperson of the CPC Central Committee extends thanks to the Canadian Seamen's Union and the Singapore Federation of Trade Unions for their lofty international friendship towards the Chinese people. These two trade unions are currently resisting the Canadian reactionary government's transportation of weapons and military equipment to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The spokesperson of the CPC Central Committee stated: The Canadian reactionary government, following in the footsteps of American imperialists, has provided the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang with a loan of 60 million US dollars and 150 Mosquito bombers to help it carry out the civil war to slaughter the Chinese people, which has aroused great anger among the Chinese people. The Canadian reactionary government's so-called "loan" of 60 million US dollars is actually a synonym for munitions, and all its assistance to the Chiang bandits is actually military assistance. The sinister and brutal conspiracies of the imperialists, and the ferocious faces hidden behind the so-called "democracy" mask, are now completely exposed, and are being righteously opposed by workers in Canada and Singapore. The Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude to the Canadian Seamen's Union and the Singapore Federation of Trade Unions for their assistance to the Chinese people. This lofty spirit of international solidarity demonstrated by Canadian and Singaporean workers has greatly increased the courage of the Chinese people to fight for liberation, and believes that the people of the world will surely win in the struggle against imperialism and for people's democracy, because the spirit of close unity among the people of all countries is a great and unparalleled force, and in the face of this force, the enemies of the people will ultimately fail.

　　中共中央发言人发表谈话
    反对加拿大反动政府军事援蒋
  　向加拿大新加坡工人义举致谢
    【新华社陕北十五日电】中共中央发言人对加拿大海员工会与新加坡工会联合会向中国人民所表示的崇高的国际友谊致谢。该两工会现正在抵制加拿大反动政府运送武器及兵工器材给蒋介石匪帮。中共中央发言人称：加拿大反动政府追随美国帝国主义者之后，给蒋介石匪帮以六千万美元的借款和蚊式轰炸机一百五十架，帮助其进行屠杀中国人民的内战，已引起中国人民的很大愤怒。加拿大反动政府的六千万美元的所谓“借款”原来就是军火的代名词，其给与蒋匪的全部援助，原来都是军事援助。帝国主义者的不可告人的残暴阴谋，所谓“民主主义”面具后面掩盖着的狰狞面目，现在是揭穿无遗，而且遭受到加拿大与新加坡工人的正义的反对了。加拿大海员工会与新加坡工会联合会对于中国人民的援助，中国人民表示衷心的感谢。加拿大海员工人与新加坡工人所表现的这种崇高的国际团结的精神，大大增高了中国人民为解放而斗争的勇气，并且相信全世界人民在反对帝国主义及争取人民民主的斗争中必能胜利，因为各国人民亲密团结的精神乃是伟大无比的力量，在这个力量的面前，人民的敌人必将最后失败。
