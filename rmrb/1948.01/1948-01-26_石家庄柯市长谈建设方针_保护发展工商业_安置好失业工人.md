Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 24th: Late-breaking news: On January 1st, Shijiazhuang Democratic Government Mayor Ke Qingshi elaborated in detail on the democratic government's determination to build Shijiazhuang City at a symposium with people from all walks of life in Shijiazhuang. Mayor Ke first explained to the attendees that the construction of Shijiazhuang is a set policy of the democratic government. This is because after the liberation of Shijiazhuang, it is no longer a war fortification or isolated island under the rule of bandits and puppets. Now, Shijiazhuang is integrated with the vast towns and villages of the liberated areas. Regarding the issue of protecting national industry and commerce, Mayor Ke emphasized that protecting and developing industry and commerce in the city and carrying out land reform and eliminating feudalism in the countryside are two different things and two different policies. The "Land Law Outline of China" and the "Manifesto of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" both have clear stipulations. In the future, the main task of state-owned stores will be to guarantee supply and stabilize prices, not to eliminate private industry and commerce. Regarding the protection of legitimate industry and commerce, Mayor Ke explained that the democratic municipal government has done the following major work: (1) The trade company has transported a large number of daily necessities, ensuring the needs of the citizens. (2) The bank has set reasonable exchange rates for exchanging KMT currency, and at the same time, prohibited the transaction of raw gold and silver, stabilizing the financial market and causing prices to drop sharply. (3) The phenomenon of some outsiders rushing to purchase materials has been prohibited, and KMT bandits who robbed stores have been punished. (4) Exorbitant taxes and levies have been abolished, and reasonable burdens have been implemented, reducing the burden on the people and industry and commerce. Regarding the resettlement of unemployed workers, Mayor Ke said: Those who can resume work should be assisted in resuming work as much as possible. For those who cannot resume work, the government will take the following measures: (1) Those whose homes are in the liberated areas will be called upon to return home to divide land and divide spoils. (2) Change careers. (3) Establish technical schools. Finally, Mayor Ke emphasized the issue of the construction of the democratic regime in Shijiazhuang, saying: Today's government is a democratic coalition government, not a dictatorship of the proletariat, nor a dictatorship of the peasants, but a local coalition government of a broad united front composed of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants from all walks of life.

　　石家庄柯市长谈建设方针
  　保护发展工商业
    安置好失业工人
    【新华社晋察冀二十四日电】迟到消息：一月一日石家庄民主市政府柯庆施市长，于石市各界座谈会上，对民主政府决心建设石家庄市方针阐述颇详。柯氏首向与会各界人士说明建设石家庄乃是民主政府既定方针。这是由于石市解放后，已非匪伪统治时期的内战碉堡或孤岛，现时石市业与解放区广大城镇乡村结合起来。关于保护民族工商业问题，柯市长着重说明，在城市里保护和发展工商业，和农村实行土地改革、消灭封建是两件事，两个政策。中国土地法大纲及解放军宣言均有明文规定。今后公营商店主要任务乃为保证供给，平抑物价，而不是消灭私人工商业。关于保护正当工商业方面，柯市长说明民主市政府已做了如下主要工作：（一）贸易公司运来大批日用物资，保证了市民的需要。（二）银行规定了合理的牌价，兑换蒋币，同时禁止生金银交易，稳定了金融市场，使物价急剧下降。（三）禁止了某些外来人员抢购物资的现象，惩办了抢劫商店的蒋家匪徒。（四）废除了苛捐杂税与摊派制度，实行合理负担，减轻人民与工商业负担。关于安置失业工人，柯市长说：能复工者当尽量设法协助复工。不能复工者，政府将采取以下措施：（一）家在解放区者，号召其回家分土地分浮财。（二）转业。（三）开办技工学校。最后柯市长着重谈及石市民主政权建设问题时说：今天的政府是民主联合政府，不是无产阶级专政，也不是农民专政，而是工、农、兵、学、商各界组成的广泛统一战线的地方性的联合政府。
