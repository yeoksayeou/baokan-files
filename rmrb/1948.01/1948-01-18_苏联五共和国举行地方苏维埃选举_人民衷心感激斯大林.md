Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Moscow dispatch: Local Soviet elections were held in five Soviet republics, including Byelorussia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and Azerbaijan, on the 11th. Men and women in urban workers' residential areas and villages had already gathered at the entrances of the polling stations to wait before the scheduled election time. The situation was even more enthusiastic in places where the great Stalin and his closest comrades Molotov, Zhdanov, and other Party and government leaders were candidates. All regions joyfully celebrated the election day. In Gori, Stalin's birthplace, every house was decorated with flags and streamers, and plastered with slogans and catchphrases. Early in the morning, thousands of local residents flocked to the election districts to exercise their sacred civil rights. A cotton planter from Kyrgyzstan, who participated in the voting, vividly expressed the enthusiasm of millions of people in his speech. He said, "In my youth, I and our people suffered tremendous hardships. The landlords often whipped us, and I hated that time! Now our place is bathed in sunshine. This is the sun that Stalin gave us, and we sincerely thank him."
