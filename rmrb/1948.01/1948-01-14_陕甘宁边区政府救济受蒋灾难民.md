　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 10th. After the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region suffered severe damage from Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, 400,000 people are facing famine. According to incomplete statistics, 195 out of the 217 districts in the entire Border Region were ravaged by Chiang Kai-shek's bestial hooves, resulting in losses of 190,000 shi of grain, over 62,000 head of cattle, over 100,000 pieces of farm equipment, and the abandonment of over 3.6 million mu of cultivated land. The damage was particularly severe in counties such as Mizhi, Zhenchuan, Jiaxian, Hengshan, Zizhou, Jingbian, Yanchuan, Anse, and Zichang. In addition to dispatching several relief teams to various disaster areas around October and allocating huge amounts of grain and funds for relief, the Border Region Government has also implemented austerity measures in local government agencies to save resources for disaster relief and launched mass disaster relief campaigns. All employees of the Northwest Printing Factory have been saving four liang of millet per person per day since the 9th of last month to help disaster victims. County-level government agencies in Yanchuan County launched a mass donation campaign of "one sheng of rice, one piece of clothing, one basket of dates, and one bowl." Cadres save one liang of rice per person per day and organize disaster area visiting groups for emergency relief. At the recent summary meeting on production and disaster relief, Jia Tuofu, Deputy Director of the Northwest Financial and Economic Office, pointed out ten measures for disaster relief production: combining land reform, organizing winter sideline production, developing rural small-scale cooperation, mobilizing the masses for mutual aid, launching grain protection struggles, allocating and using rural public property, practicing thrift and planned migration, and providing government loans to prepare for spring production. He also pointed out to all cadres who are about to depart for the disaster areas again: they must establish a class perspective, be hardworking and endure hardship, serve the impoverished disaster victims faithfully, and fight to overcome the severe Chiang's calamities.

　　陕甘宁边区政府救济受蒋灾难民
    【新华社西北十日电】陕甘宁边区遭受蒋匪严重破坏后，有四十万人民面临饥馑。据不完全统计，全边区二百十七个区遭受蒋匪兽蹄破坏者，即达一百九十五个区，损失粮食十九万石，牛六万二千余头，农具十余万件，荒芜耕地三百六十余万亩，而在米脂、镇川、葭县、横山、子洲、靖边、延川、安塞、子长等县受害尤为严重。边府除已于十月前后分派若干救济小组赴各灾区，拨发巨额粮款赈济外，各地政府机关均节约救灾，开展群众性的救灾运动。西北印刷厂全体职工自上月九日起每人每日节省小米四两救济灾民。延川县级机关发起“一升米，一件衣，一筐枣，一个碗”的群众性募捐运动。干部每人每天节省米一两，并组织救灾区访问团紧急救济。最近在生产救灾总结大会上，西北财经办事处副主任贾拓夫指出救灾生产十项办法：结合土改，组织冬季副业生产，发展农村小型合作，发动群众互救互助，展开护粮斗争，分配使用农村公产，节衣缩食有计划的移民，政府贷款准备春季生产等。并对即将再次出发灾区全体干部指出：要确立阶级观点，刻苦耐劳，为贫苦灾民忠诚服务，为战胜严重蒋灾而斗争。
