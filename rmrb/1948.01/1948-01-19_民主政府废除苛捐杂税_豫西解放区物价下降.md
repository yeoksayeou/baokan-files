　　Democratic Government Abolishes Heavy Taxes and Levies
  　Prices Fall in the Western Henan Liberated Area
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E (Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei) 15th dispatch] After the democratic government of the Yu-Shaan-E Liberated Area abolished heavy taxes and levies, prices have generally fallen. Before liberation in the Nanzhao and Nanyang areas, wheat sold for more than 210,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency per斗 (dǒu, a unit of dry measure), but now it only costs 80,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency per斗. In the Biyang and Wuyang areas, cotton has fallen from 38,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency per斤 (jīn, a unit of weight, roughly a pound) to only 28,000 yuan. The prices of other commodities have fallen by 20 to 30 percent. However, in the neighboring Kuomintang-occupied areas, prices are constantly rising. In Zhumadian (reoccupied by the Kuomintang bandits), pork sells for 14,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency per斤, and it is still difficult to buy. But in the liberated areas of Biyang and Fangcheng, it only costs 7,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency per斤. In the heartland of the Liberated Area, the exchange rate of Jicha (Hebei-Chahar) currency to Kuomintang currency has also increased from 1:10 to 1:20. Kuomintang currency with a face value of 500 yuan has become waste paper.

　　民主政府废除苛捐杂税
  　豫西解放区物价下降
    【新华社豫陕鄂十五日电】豫陕鄂解放区民主政府废除苛捐杂税后，物价普遍下降。南召、南阳地区解放前，麦子每斗卖蒋币二十一万多元，现在每斗只合蒋币八万元。泌阳、舞阳地区棉花从每斤蒋币三万八千降到只合二万八千元。别的物价都下降了百分之二十到三十。但邻近的蒋占区内，物价却不断上涨。驻马店（蒋匪重占）的猪肉每斤卖蒋币一万四千元，还难买到。但在解放区泌阳、方城，每斤只合蒋币七千元。解放区腹心地区，冀钞兑蒋币也从一比十提高到一比二十。票面五百元的蒋币，已成废纸。
