Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Beiping News: Disregarding the life and death of stall vendors, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Beiping Municipal Government authorities decided last month to implement "centralized management" of stall vendors in order to facilitate tax extraction. The total number of stall vendors in Beiping reaches more than 120,000. Some have been vendors for many years, and many are merchants who were bankrupted under the tyranny of the Chiang Kai-shek government and were forced to take up small businesses. Some set up small general merchandise stalls in front of shops, while others peddle along the streets, such as selling sliced cakes, sweet potatoes, and buying old goods (commonly known as "buying junk" in Beiping). At present, prices are constantly rising, and the purchasing power of citizens is decreasing daily. The income of many stall vendors is not even enough to make a living. If business is concentrated, business will become even more sluggish, and the lives of 120,000 people will be in dire straits. Therefore, stall vendor representatives from all over Beiping have convened to discuss how to deal with this brutal measure of the Chiang Kai-shek authorities.

　　北平十二万做小生意的被蒋匪逼得生活不下去
    【新华社陕北十九日电】北平消息：蒋匪北平市政府当局，不顾摊贩死活，为了便于榨取税收，已于上月决定实行“集中管理”摊贩。北平摊贩总数达十二万余，一部分系多年摊贩，有许多则是蒋匪政府暴政下陷于破产，而被迫改做小本生意的商人。他们有的在商店前摆个小杂货摊，有的则沿街叫卖。如卖切糕、红薯及收买旧物（北平俗称买破烂）等。目前物价不断高涨，市民购买力日低，许多摊贩收入已不足糊口，如果集中营业，生意将更加清淡，十二万人的生活将陷入绝境。因此北平全市摊贩已派出代表会商应付蒋匪当局此种残民措施。
