Criticism and Suggestions

	Forcing the Masses to Invest is Wrong

	The shares of the Yangjiaxigou Cooperative in the Ninth District of Lin County were mostly obtained from the fruits of struggle. Later, the cooperative adopted a decentralized approach, becoming seven or eight small cooperatives. As a result, there were many workers, and no rice to eat. The village cadres forced the masses to invest one dou of rice per household, and also held a mass meeting, saying, "The cooperative serves the masses, so everyone must invest. No one is allowed to leave until they sign up." The masses had no choice but to sign. Forty-five poor and hired peasant households, and seventy-five middle peasant households, accumulated a total of seven shi and eight dou of rice, and those without rice contributed five thousand five hundred yuan. Some poor and hired peasants couldn't afford it, and it's still recorded in the books. The rice was valued at 174,000 yuan at market price.

	The village cadres also held a women's meeting. Village Chief Yang Zhonghua said, "Our village is establishing a dyeing workshop, so you can dye cloth cheaply in the future." The masses were silent. The village chief said, "Everyone must invest, it won't work if you don't." No one spoke. The village chief said, "You don't know what's good for you. Whoever doesn't invest, lock the door and stand guard. No one is allowed to leave until they sign up." The women had no choice but to sign, accumulating a total of 110,600 yuan before the meeting was dismissed. (Zhen Nan, Qing Xin)

	It was already wrong to start a cooperative with the fruits of struggle. It's even more wrong to have mismanaged it and squandered the capital. To forcibly compel poor and hired peasants and middle peasants to invest, locking the door and standing guard, not allowing anyone to leave until they invest, is simply extortion. Forcible orders and oppression of the masses are utterly outrageous. We hope that the leaders of Lin County's county and district levels will immediately conduct a serious inspection and handle this matter, and write to us about the handling situation.

　　不该强迫群众入股
    林县九区杨家西沟合作社的股金，大部是斗争果实。以后合作社采取了分散方法，成了七、八个小型合作社。结果工人多，吃的没有了米。村干部强迫群众一户入一斗米，还召开了群众会，说：“合作社为群众服务，都得入股，谁不写不准走。”群众没法子，只好写。贫雇农四十五户，中农七十五户，共积了七石八斗米，没米的凑了五千五百元。有些贫雇出不起，现还在帐上记着。把米按市价作了十七万四千元。
    村干部还召开了妇女会，村长杨忠花说：“咱村成立染房，你们以后染布便宜。”群众不作声。村长说：“都得入，不入不行。”没人说话。村长说：“不知好歹，谁不入股，把门关住，站上岗。谁不写，不能走。”妇女没有办法，只得写吧，共积了十一万零六百元才散会。（振南、清新）
    用斗争果实开合作社，本来就不对。因为办理不好，把本钱吃光了，更不对。还要强迫贫雇和中农入股，关住门站上岗，不入股不能走，这简直是勒索。强迫命令，压迫群众，可算胡闹极了。希望林县县、区领导上立刻认真的检查处理，并把处理情形写给我们。　　　　　　——编者
