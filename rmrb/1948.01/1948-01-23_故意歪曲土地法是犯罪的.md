To the Editor:

　　Zhao Wenhua, the political director of Guanzhuang Village, Ninth District of Lin County, after receiving the newspaper and seeing the Outline Land Law, took it back to his own home. When the masses asked to read it, he said, "The higher authorities haven't instructed us, so we can't look at it casually!" After the cadres of Tongtou Village saw the Outline Land Law, they put it in their pockets. The masses were brewing to see it, but couldn't. This kind of thing should be stopped immediately.

To the Editor:

　　Shi Jinchang, a teacher from Shitai Village, Seventh District of She County (of landlord origin), deliberately wrote the Land Law on the public blackboard as: "The fruits distributed to the masses should be returned in their entirety and divided equally with the landlords and rich peasants. Those who violate this and don't return them will be dealt with by the People's Court in the future." The village head and political director discovered this and questioned him, and then he erased it. We hope that the She County Education Section will conduct an inspection of Shi Jinchang and severely punish all those who undermine the Land Law.

　　故意歪曲土地法是犯罪的编辑同志：
    林县九区官庄村政治主任赵文花，接到报纸，看见土地法大纲后，即拿回自己家，群众纷纷要求叫读，他却说：“上级没布置，不能随便看！”同头村干部看到土地法大纲后，装在口袋里，群众酝酿着要看，却看不上，对于这种事情，应该立刻制止。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　侯振南、郭怀、宋天聚编辑同志：
    涉县七区史邰村教员史金昌（地主出身），在大众黑板上写土地法，故意写成：“群众分的果实，应一律退出来，和地主富农平分，违反不退，将来交人民法庭处理。”村长、政治主任发现后去质问他，才擦掉了。希望涉县教育科对史金昌作一检查，严办一切破坏土地法的人。
