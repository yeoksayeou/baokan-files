(Report from our newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 1st) A correspondent from our branch office commented on the military struggle situation in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area over the past year, stating: Over the past year, local regiments, county brigades, and militia protect-the-fields teams in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, with their heroic and tenacious posture, persisted in their positions amidst the enemy's and our army's seesaw guerrilla warfare, crushed Chiang Kai-shek's "encirclement and suppression," coordinated with the main force's operations, assisted the masses in land reform, and strengthened their own armed forces. The military struggle situation in Hebei-Shandong-Henan over the past year can be divided into four stages:

From January to March, the enemy's offensive arrogance could still reach north of the Yellow River, occupying Puyang, Hua County, Qingfeng, Nanle, and Pu County, Guan County, Fan County, and other places, and carrying out frenzied "encirclement and suppression" in county towns and townships south of the Yellow River. However, our local armed forces were still able to adopt the tactics of "the enemy advances, we advance; turning to the enemy's rear" to persist in the struggle in the rural hinterland, containing the enemy's forces, putting the enemy's seven divisions into the predicament of defending cities and highway transportation lines, and reducing the burden on our main force's operations. In early February, Liu Deng's army captured Juye, Jiaxiang, Dingtao, and Cao County, annihilating more than 10,000 enemies, and launched an attack on the Longhai Railway, drawing the enemy back. During this period, the enemy launched more than 20 consecutive "encirclement and suppression" operations involving more than 1,000 people, but our local armed forces tenaciously persisted in this struggle, laying the foundation for independent and sustained struggle.

From March to the end of June, a period of four months, was a period of independent persistence for our local armed forces. In early March, our main force crossed the Yellow River northward and moved west to northern Henan. At this time, the enemy's eight divisions were distributed in counties, townships, and along transportation lines south of the Yellow River, attempting to extinguish our thriving guerrilla warfare south of the Yellow River, and using local "homecoming legions" to guard the Yellow River, replacing his 400,000 troops. Therefore, the war in Henan was unprecedentedly frequent. Especially in the Huxi and southwestern Shandong sub-districts, at this moment, the local regiments launched external attacks to subdue the enemy behind enemy lines, while the inland militia, with one hand holding a gun and the other distributing land, launched tunnel warfare. The tunnels in the 3rd and 5th sub-districts were as dense as spider webs, and Chiang Kai-shek's main force and local diehards were in awe and dared not take a step forward. The people of the four sub-districts of Henan, under the principle of "one hand holding a gun and the other distributing land," mostly received land and armed themselves, preparing for our main force's southward counter-offensive.

From July to October was the third stage. In early July, Liu Deng's counter-offensive army crossed the natural barrier of the Yellow River, continuously annihilating nine and a half enemy brigades, and then crossed the Longhai Railway southward. The situation in Henan returned to a situation of seesaw warfare between the enemy and our forces. In the most tense 50 days, there was an average of one seesaw battle every five days. During this period, our local armed forces actively coordinated with the main force's operations, achieving a victory of annihilating 3,000 enemies. Our vast countryside completed the task of supporting the field army.

After October, the situation in Hebei-Shandong-Henan greatly changed, and the focus of the war shifted to the Longhai Railway and its southern areas. Our local armed forces then turned to actively attacking the enemy, and the enemy was in a defensive and passive position. The few remaining enemies scattered in Henan, such as the 73rd Division, 84th Brigade, 70th Division, 20th Division, 68th Division, 55th Division, and 41st Brigade, were also often trapped in strongholds and dared not easily commit crimes. Last month, the local armed forces of the Huxi sub-district captured the major stronghold of Zhao Zhuangji, and the local armed forces of the 1st sub-district entered Shiheng Town. This month, our local regiments launched attacks in two directions, east and west. The eastern local regiment captured Dongping, and in the Yundong campaign, annihilated more than 1,000 enemies, recovering a vast area of 70 miles on both sides of the Grand Canal. The 1st and 7th sub-districts have already been united. The western corps attacking northern Henan captured Changyuan, annihilating more than 500 enemies.

The branch correspondent concluded: Over the past year, the local armed forces in Hebei-Shandong-Henan annihilated more than 27,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits. At the beginning of the year, we only occupied 10 county towns, but now we occupy 26 cities, expanding the area by two times compared to the beginning of the year. The nine sub-districts of the entire region have been united, and the local armed forces have increased more than ninefold in the war, and have considerable equipment. The remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandits trapped in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, unable to extricate themselves, will be completely finished under the powerful iron fist of the local armed forces in due course.

　　冀鲁豫战局改观
  　全区联成一片武装扩大九倍
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】分社记者评论一年来冀鲁豫区军事斗争形势称：一年来冀鲁豫地方兵团县大队、民兵保田队，在敌我大拉锯的游击战争形势下，以英勇顽强的姿态，坚持了阵地，粉碎了蒋匪的“清剿”，配合了主力军作战和帮助群众土地改革，并壮大了自己的武装。一年来冀鲁豫军事斗争的形势可分为四个阶段：从一月至三月，敌人的进攻气焰还能达到黄河以北，侵占了濮阳、滑县、清丰、南乐及濮县、观县、范县等地，并在黄河南岸县城及乡镇点线进行疯狂的“清剿”，但我地方武装仍能采取敌进我进、转入敌后坚持农村腹地斗争，牵制了敌人兵力，使敌七个师之众，陷入守备城市及公路交通线的困境，减轻了我主力兵团作战的负担。二月初，刘邓大军攻克钜野、嘉祥、定陶、曹县、歼敌万余，并出击陇海路，将敌人拉回去；这一个时期，敌千人以上的连续“清剿”达二十余次，但我地方武装顽强的坚持了这一斗争，打下了独立坚持斗争的基础。从三月至六月底四个月中，是我地方武装独立坚持局面的时期，我主力于三月上旬北渡黄河西向豫北，这时敌八个师分布在黄河南岸各县乡镇及交通线，企图扑灭我黄河南岸如火如荼的游击战争，而以土杂“还乡团”把守黄河，代替他的四十万大军，因此河南战争是空前的频繁；特别是湖西及鲁西南分区，此刻地方兵团则外线出击敌后制服敌人，内地民兵则一手拿枪一手分田，展开了地道斗争，三、五分区地道密如蛛网，蒋匪主力及土顽望而生畏，不敢向地道前进一步。河南四个分区的人民在一手拿枪一手分田的原则下，大部分分得了土地并武装了自己，给我主力南下反攻作了准备。从七月到十月为第三阶段。七月上旬，刘邓反攻大军渡过了黄河天险，连续歼灭敌人九个半旅，后越陇海路南下，河南形势又转入敌我重兵拉锯的形势，在最紧张的五十天内，平均每五天拉锯一次，这一个时期，我地方武装积极配合主力作战，获得了歼敌三千的胜利。我们广大的农村完成了支援野战军的任务。十月以后，冀鲁豫形势大为改观，战争重点转入陇海线及其以南地区，我地方武装即转入主动向敌人出击，敌人处于防守被动挨打的形势，散布在河南的七三师、八四旅、七○师、二○师、六八师、五五师、四十一旅等寥寥无几的残敌，亦经常困守于据点不敢轻易出犯。上月，湖西分区地方武装攻克了赵庄集大据点，一分区地武攻入了石横镇，本月来我地方兵团东西两路出击，东路地方兵团攻克东平，在运东战役中则歼敌千余名，收复运河两岸七十里之广大地区，一、七分区已打成一片，西路出击豫北之兵团，攻克长垣，歼敌五百余。分社记者最后称：一年来冀鲁豫地方武装歼灭蒋匪二万七千余，年初我仅占有县城十座，现在为我占领城市二十六座，比年初扩大地区面积两倍，全区九个分区已联成一片，地方武装在战争中增加了九倍以上，并且有相当可观的装配。陷在冀鲁豫不能自拔的残余蒋匪，在一定时间内，将会在强大的地方武装铁拳下完蛋的。
