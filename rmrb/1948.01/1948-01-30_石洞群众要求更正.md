　　Stone Cave Residents Request Correction
    After the People's Daily, which published an article about the domineering behavior of the Stone Cave branch secretary on the 15th of this month, arrived in Stone Cave Village, Duan Tiancun, who had been attacked by Duan Bingnan, pointed to Duan Tianchu's name in the newspaper and said, "The incident reported is about me, but the name is not mine. The newspaper made a mistake in one character. My name is Duan Tiancun, but the newspaper says Duan Tianchu." He also pointed to Zhang Shutang's name and said, "It's Zhang Shoutang, not Zhang Shutang." Another resident said, "The district cadre Xing Erxi is written as Yang Erxi."
    It is not good practice to fail to properly ascertain the names of those involved before writing an article. Now that the parties involved have made corrections, the comrade who wrote the article should conduct a self-criticism and permanently correct this irresponsible habit. - Editor

　　石洞群众要求更正
    本月十五日登载石洞支书横行霸道的人民日报传到石洞村后，曾被段炳南打击过的段天存，指着报纸上段天初的名字说：“事情登的是我的事情，名字不是我的，上边错了一个字，我叫段天存，报上是段天初。”他又指着张书堂的名字说：“是张守堂不是张书堂。”又一个群众说：“区干邢二喜给写成杨二喜了。”
    写稿前没有好好弄清楚当事人的姓名，这种作风不大好。现经当事人更正，写稿的同志应该作检查，并把这种不负责任的习惯永远改正才好。——编者
