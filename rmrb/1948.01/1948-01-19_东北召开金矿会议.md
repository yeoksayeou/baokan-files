　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 17th—The first Northeast Liberated Area Gold Mine Conference successfully concluded on the 31st of last month after nine days. In addition to formulating a plan to increase overall production tasks, the conference also summarized the work of the past year, pointing out that gold mine work has played a significant role in supporting the front lines and the national liberation war, and has gained preliminary experience in management and production. For example, the Jiapigou Gold Mine was scheduled to resume work in three months, but with the efforts of the workers, it was completed in one and a half months. The output in November last year exceeded the average monthly output during the puppet Manchukuo period by 28 percent. The conference emphasized that to increase production, it is necessary to mobilize gold mine workers and break the past erroneous concept of "being afraid that mobilizing workers will delay production." The conference also formulated "Provisional Regulations on Gold Mine Management in the Northeast Liberated Area" to strengthen unified management, and conducted in-depth discussions on the ideological style of cadres, advocating a hard-working and simple style, and going deep into the worker masses.

　　东北召开金矿会议
    【新华社东北十七日电】东北解放区第一届金矿会议历时九日，于上月三十一日胜利结束。大会除制定提高总生产任务计划外，还总结了过去一年中的工作，指出金矿工作在支援前线和支援全国解放战争上起了不少的作用，在管理和生产上也都获得了初步经验。如夹皮沟金矿预定三个月恢复工作，由于工人的努力，一个半月就全部完成。去年十一月份的产量，已超过伪满时每月平均产量的百分之二十八。大会着重指出：提高生产，必须发动金矿工人，打破过去“怕发动工人耽误生产”的错误观念。大会并制定“东北解放区金矿管理暂行条例”，以加强统一管理，对干部思想作风问题也进行了深入的讨论，提倡艰苦朴实，深入工人群众的作风。
