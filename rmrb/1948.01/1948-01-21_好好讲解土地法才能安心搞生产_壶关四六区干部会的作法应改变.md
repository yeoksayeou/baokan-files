　　Explaining the Land Law Well is Essential for Secure Production
　　The Approach of the Fourth and Sixth District Cadre Meetings in Huguan Should Be Changed
　　[Taihang News] After the Fourth and Sixth Districts of Huguan saw the Land Law Outline and a large number of district cadres went to study it, the village cadres' thinking became confused and uneasy. They wanted to rush to divide the land and had no heart to lead winter production. On the 9th of this month, the Sixth District convened a meeting of village chiefs, political directors, production directors, and other cadres, focusing on discussing what the current central task was. The Nan Zhang political director said, "Now we still have to produce well and earn rice. We will divide the land next spring, and we still have to eat rice when planting in the autumn." The Qiaoshang political director said, "We now have to grasp the principle of relying on hired and poor peasants, uniting with middle peasants, and overthrowing landlords to divide the land for propaganda. We are not going to divide the land immediately, but we still have to focus on leading production well and pay attention to bad guys destroying it." Everyone began to clarify that the current focus is still on leading winter production to make up for the deficit. The Fourth District, in order to organize strong village cadres and strengthen the leadership of winter production in various villages through mutual assistance and research methods, convened a joint meeting of village chiefs, political directors, and teachers on the 6th of this month to discuss specific matters. In the beginning, they mobilized from the aspect of "a large deficit due to last year's poor harvest," arousing everyone's enthusiasm to continue leading production, and reflected on the rest and self-flow phenomena of the past few days, and formulated a twenty-day winter production plan.
　　Since the cadres have doubts about the Land Law and express unease, the problem cannot be solved solely by guiding production. It should be explained in conjunction with the Central Bureau's letter to party members and the Land Law Outline that has been published in this newspaper. Only in this way can winter production continue. The leadership in this area should change this formalistic approach.

　　好好讲解土地法才能安心搞生产
  　壶关四六区干部会的作法应改变
    【太行消息】壶关四、六区看到土地法大纲和大批区干部去学习后，各村干部思想上混乱不安，想赶快平分，没心领导冬季生产。六区在本月九日，召开了村长、政治主任、生产主任等干部会，着重讨论当前中心到底搞啥？南掌政治主任说：“现在还是得好好生产赚米，明春平分土地，种秋还得吃米呀。”桥上政治主任说：“咱现在掌握住依靠雇贫、团结中农、打倒地主平分土地的原则宣传，不是马上就要平分，还是好好领导生产为主，注意坏蛋破坏。”大家开始明确了当下还是领导冬产补窟窿为主。四区更为了把强的村干部组织起来，用互助研究办法，加强各村冬季生产的领导，本月六日，召开各村长、政治主任、教员联合会，具体讨论。开始，是从“去年歉收窟窿很大”这方面动员，鼓起大家继续领导生产的情绪，并纷纷对前几天的休息、自流现象作了反省，订出二十天的冬季生产计划。
    干部既已对土地法发生怀疑，表现不安，就不能单从引导生产上来解决问题，应该结合本报已发表的中央局的告党员书，及土地法大纲进行解释，也只有这样，冬季生产才能继续进行。该地领导上应转变这种形式主义的作法才对。
