　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 15th: A serious phenomenon of landlords and rich peasants secretly slaughtering and abusing livestock has been discovered in various areas of this region. Li Zengliang, a rich peasant in Lijiawan, Xing County, deliberately damaged the hooves of an ox used for pulling coal and used this as an excuse to slaughter it. Yang Peiji and Yang Bingyin, landlords in Yangjiapo Village, and five or six other landlord families, did not properly feed their livestock, causing them to become thin and sick. Landlords in the village also burned large quantities of fodder as firewood, leaving peasants with no grass to feed their cattle after the distribution. The Jin-Sui Border Region Administrative Office and the Provisional Committee of the Farmers' Association have jointly issued a circular, calling on all peasants to be vigilant and defeat the landlords' plot to resist land reform and sabotage production. The circular stipulates that the slaughter and deliberate damaging of livestock is strictly prohibited. Violators will be charged with sabotage of production and handed over to the masses for handling or sent to the government for legal action. If livestock are indeed sick or disabled and cannot be treated, they must be inspected by the peasant representative council and approved by the government tax bureau before they can be slaughtered. In villages where land reform has not yet been carried out, the livestock of landlords and rich peasants should be immediately handed over to poor peasants who lack livestock for feeding and use, along with fodder, in preparation for formal distribution in the future. In villages where land reform is underway but not yet formally distributed, the livestock of landlords and rich peasants shall be managed by the peasant representative council, and the fodder of landlords and rich peasants shall also be managed by the Farmers' Association. In villages where land reform has already been carried out, peasants should also supervise each other and strictly prohibit the slaughter of livestock.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 15th: The Border Region Administrative Office recently publicly exposed in the Jin-Sui Daily that several departments and several leading comrades of this organization had made mistakes that resulted in the slaughter of oxen and harmed the interests of the working people due to impure thoughts and bureaucracy. In July of last year, the Administrative Office Tax Bureau discovered the phenomenon of selling and slaughtering cattle in Xing County, but did not pay serious attention to it. It only stipulated that anyone selling or slaughtering cattle must hold a certificate from the village farmers' association, believing that this would prevent the indiscriminate slaughter of cattle. However, from July to November of last year, the Xing County Tax Bureau approved the slaughter and sale of as many as 48 head of cattle (in previous years, only 10 head were approved annually), and beef on the market was much cheaper than pork and mutton. Wang Dingmin, head of the Tax Section of the Administrative Office and director of the Tax Bureau of the First District, not only failed to conduct an in-depth investigation of this phenomenon, but instead instructed his subordinates to buy cattle to improve their lives. As a result, three catering units of the Administrative Office competed to buy cattle for slaughter. Sun Jianfeng, the person in charge of the Secretariat, also believed that eating beef was good, "It does not exceed the supply standard and can improve the food." At that time, iron needles, copper coins, and iron wires were peeled out of the stomachs of the cattle, but everyone was not alert or concerned about this, and only satisfied with eating beef. At the end of September, Comrade Wu Xinyu, Director of the Administrative Office, returned from outside and discovered the eating of beef. He immediately inquired and asked Sun Jianfeng to be alert to the landlords' and rich peasants' conspiracy to sabotage production, and ordered Chen Naijun, head of the Agriculture Section of the Construction Department, to immediately investigate the slaughter of cattle and draft a ban on the slaughter of cattle; however, Sun and Chen ignored this instruction and delayed it for two months under the pretext of insufficient investigation materials, while the phenomenon of slaughtering cattle within the organization continued to develop. By the end of last year, based on the materials of slaughtering cattle within the organization and in Xing County, it was discovered that this problem had developed to a serious extent. Director Wu immediately launched the entire organization to conduct an inspection as a specific content of the ongoing three-check study. He also urgently telegraphed to all counties to strictly prohibit the slaughter of livestock. Director Wu also conducted a strict self-criticism. In addition, it was decided by the Political Affairs Conference to give the following three people the following punishments: Sun Jianfeng was given a demerit, Chen Naijun was dismissed, and Wang Dingmin was given a warning.

　　晋绥地主富农暗杀牲畜
  　行署农会下令禁止
    【新华社晋绥十五日电】本区各地已发现地主富农暗地宰杀和虐害牲畜的严重现象。兴县李家湾富农李增良用耕牛拉炭，故意弄坏牛蹄，借此宰杀。该县杨家坡杨培基、杨秉寅等五六家地主，不好好喂养牲畜，使牲畜瘦病。该村地主并大量以饲草当柴烧，使农民分牛后无草可喂。晋绥边区行署及农会临时委员会顷特发表联合通令，号召全体农民警觉起来，击破地主阶级反抗土地改革破坏生产的毒计。通令并规定，严禁宰杀和故意弄坏牲畜，违者以破坏生产论罪，交群众处理或送政府法办。如确系有病或残废而又无法治疗之牲畜，须经农民代表会查验及政府税局批准，方可宰杀。尚未进行土地改革之村庄，地主富农之牲畜应立即交与缺乏牲畜之贫苦农民喂养使用，并附带草料，以备将来正式分配。凡尚未正式分配而正在进行土地改革之村庄，地主富农牲畜由农民代表会管制，地主富农之饲草亦应交由农会管制。凡已经土地改革之村庄，农民亦应相互监督，严禁宰杀牲畜。
    【新华社晋绥十五日电】边区行政公署顷在晋绥日报公开揭发本机关几个部门和几位领导同志，由于思想不纯和官僚主义，造成宰杀耕牛，损害劳动人民利益的错误。去年七月，行署税务局发现兴县卖牛杀牛现象，但未予以严重注意，只规定凡卖牛宰牛者须持有本村农会证明信，认为这样就可防止乱杀耕牛。但从去年七月到十一月，兴县税局验准杀卖之耕牛达四十八头（往年全年仅验准十头），市场上牛肉比猪羊肉便宜很多。行署税务科长兼一分区税务局长王定民对此现象不仅未深入检查，反吩咐下级买牛改善生活。于是行署机关三个伙食单位竞相买牛宰杀。秘书室负责人孙剑峰也认为吃牛肉好，“不超过供给标准，又可改善伙食。”当时曾从牛胃中剥出铁针铜钱铁丝等物，大家对此也毫不警惕和过问，以吃牛肉为满足。九月底，行署主任武新宇同志自外归来，发现吃牛肉，立即查问，要孙剑峰警惕地主富农破坏生产的阴谋，并责成建设处农业科长陈乃君立即调查杀牛情况，草拟杀牛禁令；但孙、陈漠视此一指示，借口调查材料不够而拖延两月之久，本机关内部杀牛现象则继续发展。至去年年底，根据机关内部及兴县杀牛材料，发现这一问题已发展到严重程度，武主任立即发动整个机关进行检查，作为正在进行三查学习的具体内容之一。并已紧急电告各县，严禁宰杀牲畜。武主任亦进行了严格的自我批评。另经政务会议决定给予下列三人以处分：孙剑峰记过、陈乃君撤职、王定民警告。
