　　Returning Misappropriated Loans and Concentrating Distribution to Poor and Hired Peasants
  　Taihang Second Special District Office Issues Instructions
    [Our Dispatch] The Taihang Second Special District Office issued an instruction on January 6th, stating that this year's winter production in many places is cloaked in the guise of the poor and hired peasant line, but is actually guided by the old spirit and old methods. The main force is concentrated on transportation, finding ways for livestock, but not finding ways and thinking about solutions for the poor and hired peasants who have not yet turned over. Problem considerations do not start from the interests of the poor and hired peasants. Some areas have grand-scale and brilliant achievements in the winter production movement, which need to be thoroughly checked. We must not be satisfied with some general calculations of achievements, but should focus on checking the guiding ideology of leading winter production. It also pointed out that the following work must be carried out at present: (1) First of all, loans must be concentrated and lent to poor and hired peasants. All the winter loans issued this winter and various loans in cash this year, as well as the inappropriately issued funds checked in the past, should be taken out and examined and approved by the loan committee of the poor and hired peasants who have not yet turned over, and concentratedly lent to the poor and hired peasants who have not yet turned over. (2) District and village cadres and cooperatives who borrow, use, encroach upon, or misappropriate loans must immediately take them all out and lend them to the poor and hired peasants who have not yet turned over. Otherwise, once found, they will be subject to disciplinary action and will not be forgiven. Village cadres must listen to the opinions of the poor and hired peasants when distributing loans, and must not exploit the poor and hired peasants or disrespect their interests. (3) In terms of methods, regardless of border areas, hinterland, old areas, or new areas, a top-down and bottom-up inspection of the winter production movement should be carried out without exception to check who are the people who have benefited greatly from this movement and who are the people who have not moved and have not benefited, and what are the reasons. The loans must truly mobilize the poor and hired peasants to check. (Second Special District Communications Group)

　　归还挪用贷款集中发给贫雇
  　太行二专署发出指示
    【本报消息】太行二专署在一月六号发了一个指示，说今年冬季生产在不少地方都是披了贫雇路线的外衣，实际是用旧的精神旧的方法指导。把主要力量集中在运输上，给牲口找出路，而没给未翻身的贫雇找出路、想办法，考虑问题没从贫雇利益出发。有些地区冬季生产运动规模宏大，成绩辉煌，是须要深入检查的，绝不能满足于一些笼统的成绩计算，而应着重检查领导冬季生产的指导思想。并指出目前必须进行以下工作：（一）首先把贷款要集中贷给贫雇农。将今冬发放的冬贷及今年各种贷款现款以及检查过去发放不合适的款项全部拿出，经未翻身的贫雇贷款委员会审查批准，集中的贷给未翻身的贫雇。（二）区村干部，合作社借用动用侵占挪用贷款的，要马上全部拿出来贷给未翻身的贫雇，否则一经查出，定予纪律处分，绝不宽恕。村干部在分配贷款上，必须倾听贫雇意见，不得有利用贫雇不尊重贫雇利益的行为。（三）在作法上不论边地、腹地、老区、新区毫无例外的开展一个自上而下的自下而上的检查冬季生产运动，检查这段动起来的得利大的是哪些人，没动起来没得利的是哪些人，原因是什么，贷款一定要真正发动贫雇农来检查。（二专通讯组）
