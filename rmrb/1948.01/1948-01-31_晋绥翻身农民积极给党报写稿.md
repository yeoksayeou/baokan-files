Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, January 27th: During the land reform and anti-"Kelikong" movement, many liberated peasants actively wrote for their own newspaper. The third and fourth districts of Baode have already organized 47 peasant correspondents, and the district peasant representative meeting specifically discussed the communication work. Literate liberated peasants are brewing to participate in the communication group, and some illiterate peasants also voluntarily provide materials and join the group to participate in discussions. At present, ten communication groups have been established in the two districts, and 23 submissions have been made to the newspaper, which has published 16 of them in prominent positions and praised them. The biggest feature of these articles is that the content is practical, reflecting the local work and the demands of the masses, and the language is lively and mass-oriented. Peasant correspondents pay great attention to the authenticity and political significance of their articles, and are absolutely responsible to their newspapers. Before writing, they discuss it first; after writing, they read it aloud to everyone and have it reviewed by the group, and then send it to the district committee for review (important manuscripts are sent to the county committee for review). After the newspaper publishes it, they read the newspaper again to see if the editor's revisions are correct and why such revisions are needed, in order to learn writing. The newspaper editorial department also gives the greatest care to the manuscripts of peasant correspondents, and whether they are published or not, they humbly provide opinions to the authors in order to cultivate peasant correspondents as the most important task.

　　晋绥翻身农民积极给党报写稿
    【新华社晋绥二十七日电】在土地改革与反“客里空”运动中，许多翻身农民积极为自己的报纸写稿。保德三、四两区业已组织四十七名农民通讯员，区农民代表会并专门讨论了通讯工作。识字的翻身农民酝酿参加通讯小组，有些不识字的农民也自愿供给材料和加入小组参加讨论。现该两区已建立十个通讯小组，向报纸投稿二十三件，报纸则以显著地位刊用十六件并予以赞扬。这些稿件的最大特点，是内容实际，反映了当地工作和群众要求，语言生动和群众化。农民通讯员们对稿件的真实性和政治意义极为注意，对自己报纸绝对负责。写稿之前先讨论，写好后念给大家听，经小组审查，再送区委审查（重要稿件送县委审查）。经报纸刊用后，他们又读报，看编辑修改得对不对和为什么需要这样修改，以学习写作。报纸编辑部对农民通讯员的稿件也同样予以最大的关心，无论刊用与否都虚心地对作者提供意见，以培养农民通讯员为最重要的业务。
