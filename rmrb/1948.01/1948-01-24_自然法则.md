Natural Law
    Ehrenburg

  　Who is it?
    Hundreds of American newspapers, several organs of the British Conservative Party, and some French newspapers bought off by foreigners, write every day: "The Russians—they are imperialists," "The Soviet Union thirsts for expansion," "Moscow threatens peace." An old trick: the thief runs away shouting "Catch the thief!" Who puts a pistol on the table while talking about peace? Who establishes military bases on the five continents of the world? Who interferes in the internal affairs of other countries, and says that the people of other countries are the protected? Who is conducting or secretly encouraging the war in Greece, the war in Indonesia, the war in China, the war in the Near East? Who is sending cannons, warships, instructors and supervisors to China and Turkey, to Iran and Greece now? Who despises the beauty of Naples, the cigars of Manila, the radio stations of Algiers, the slums of Shanghai, the islands of the Azores, the oil of Iran, the deposits of Nepal? Who openly interferes in the internal affairs of other countries, and says that he "cannot tolerate communists"? Who hypocritically criticizes the elections of democratic countries, such as Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, but deprives millions of so-called "colored" citizens of the right to vote in his own country? Who, in order to save Tsaldaris (Prime Minister of Greece - translator), curses Jefferson (drafting the American Declaration of Independence), in order to help Salazar (Prime Minister of Portugal - translator) cites the Atlantic Charter, and in order to support Franco, praises the genius of Cervantes? Who has gathered all the executioners, all the surrenderers, all the model officials in his own country—today they work in cannon factories, and tomorrow they will become cannon fodder? They repeatedly talk about these "migratory figures," these new "crusaders." Wouldn't it be better to say migratory fascism?
    When they want to seize certain countries, they are not limited by distance. The "Monroe Doctrine" is against Europeans interfering in the affairs of Americans, but after deciding to send military experts to the Dardanelles and the Aegean coast, the American imperialists calmly said: this—is—a "development of the Monroe Doctrine." They want to prohibit Europeans from interfering in European affairs. Maybe they will say that the Acropolis is on the banks of Missouri (an American state)? If the Genoese discovered America in 1492, why can't the Chicagoans "discover" Attica in 1947?…
    Not long ago, General de Gaulle made a speech against the French Republic. The godfather across the sea is not too picky, and the impression of the godson is not bad. When General de Gaulle represented the French nation in 1942, the Americans thought he was better than Admiral Darlan, who carried the flavor of Vichy (the seat of the pro-German puppet government during the anti-German war). Now that de Gaulle represents the French reactionaries, Bryte (the American bastard who desperately advocated supporting Chiang Kai-shek) also welcomes him.
    Using lofty words to cover up base deeds
    American thugs like to use lofty words to cover up base deeds. When they pour fuel oil on black people and burn them in Mississippi or Georgia, a group of murderers blow their horns, another group pray, and the third group silently recites "the victory of justice," and the daughter of the majestic race theorist, who doesn't skimp on a gallon of gasoline in this matter, sings sentimental romances. After the atomic bomb was tested on Bikini Island, American hypocrites spent a lot of money to build a monument to the killed goats. Yes, these gentlemen have bombs in one pocket and Easter eggs in the other. They have said so many touching words, and are now saying "aid to the democracy of Greece and Turkey," this honey is disgusting even to Walter Lippmann, who is used to seeing everything. He wrote: "America's strength—is on the ocean and in the sky. If we want to compete with the Red Army, we should have bases not too far from the important centers of the Soviet Union: the only strategic passage is from the Black Sea to Ukraine and the Caucasus. The eastern Mediterranean, the Aegean Sea and the Dardanelles Strait—the gateway to the Black Sea... should no longer burden itself with interpretations that have nothing in common with the nature and the resolutions passed. No one can force us to 'aid'. There is no need to say 'democracy', because everyone understands that the current Greek government is the most pathetic model of 'democracy', and Turkey, she has a very 'respected' government, but cannot be called democratic. The White House and the State Department believe that the strategic initiative of the American people has not yet matured, and they believe that the proper solution should be to add oil, add water, and add sugar in order to reassure the people. In my opinion, they made this mistake."
    Let them know
    Don't all these gentlemen understand that we were able to stand still in the face of Hitler's army, and will we tremble after listening to a dozen scary speeches and hundreds of suffocating essays? I know how little the average American knows about everything that is happening now and has happened in the past outside the borders of the United States. Let them respect the march of the pioneers of fascism in 1919 against the young Soviet Republic. Our country was weak and unarmed at the time, and the powers advancing towards us were dizzy with military victories. Let the average American know that we were weak and unarmed in Odessa, Arkhangelsk, and Vladivostok, and we expelled the invaders, although we were not able to punish them for the suffering of our people. Industrialists still believe that the anti-Soviet people's war is an unprofitable enterprise, and they will get sores instead of dividends. A quarter of a century has passed. The mad German corporal (Hitler), on the one hand, made his people stupid, and on the other hand, massively reenacted the ambitions of the interventionists. Let the average American recall how this ended: we not only expelled the invaders, but we also punished them. The fascists who fantasized about imposing their order on us first got the "Warrior's Cross" on their necks, and then an ordinary rope. Let the average American look at the scorched "Cross recipients" and think about the crosses on German graves. The people of Stalingrad cannot be intimidated.
    We are not isolated
    We shed a lot of blood in the struggle for freedom. We exchanged victory for our own blood, saved ourselves and saved the world. Not long ago, the American Major General Deane published a book, he was the head of the American military mission in Moscow. The book is entitled "The Strange Alliance". Yes, now this strange general feels that the fighting alliance of the two peoples is "strange." When we stood on the Volga River, when we drove the Germans from the Volga to the Dnieper River, when the Americans and British were enjoying the peace given to them by the fighting of the Red Army, it took us two years to sew the last button on the new uniform. At that time, General Deane felt that the fighting alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States was very natural. What is "strange" to him is that we won—this was beyond his expectations.
    Why did he lose his mental balance, eloquence and common sense? There is a well-known poem by Tyutchev:
    Winter is not angry in vain,
    It's time for her to leave—
    Spring knocks on the window,
    Sweeping in the courtyard.
    The evil witch (referring to winter) is crazy,
    Before leaving, grabbed a pile of snow,
    Thrown at that beautiful child…
    Spring's suffering will pass easily,
    She washed in the snow,
    No matter how fierce the enemy is,
    The complexion is even more ruddy.
    I will explain immediately: it is impossible to wash in the articles of "The New York Times", "Daily Telegraph" or "Time" (American reactionary newspapers and periodicals). However, the witch that Tyutchev saw was written very truthfully, the reason why the witch is crazy is because it is time for her to leave.
    We are not alone, with us, there are the people of all Europe. They know how much blood the Russians shed in the struggle against the hateful fascists. I said in the book "The Road to Europe" that the Red Army helped liberate Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. This angered Mr. Gerwise, who sent a reproach in the "New York Times": "I did not find a description of hundreds of millions of gold yuan, about the Lend-Lease Act..." How to explain to these half-merchant and half-official people that there is no income and expenditure ledger that has one page recording rivers of blood and another page recording hundreds of millions of gold yuan. There are hundreds of cities in Europe that now have "Stalingrad Street", and I have never seen a "Lend-Lease Act Street" anywhere...
    We are not alone: with us, there are the people of the whole world. The Americans who oppose us, they also oppose the American people. The British who oppose us, they also oppose the British people. The French who oppose us, they also oppose the French people. With us, there are all the people, because we are defending peace. We have shown that we can fight in the years of war; but this does not mean that we like war. We firmly believe that mothers give birth to sons, not for "crusades", people build houses, not for bombs, and people won the terrible anti-fascist war, not to allow migratory fascism to plan another more terrible war a few years later.
    Mr. Lippmann studies to what extent Americans have grown up and to what extent they have not grown up. The political vision of the average American is limited. The average American has not yet grown up enough to understand how Mr. Lippmann and other "strategic" enthusiasts fool them three times a day. However, the average American has grown up to the point of understanding common sense. That is why the American imperialists are trying to "add oil, add water, and add sugar" to their own inhumane ideas. That is why the American people, according to Mr. Lippmann, are "stable." Mr. Ayer once openly admitted: "An attack on the Soviet Union is impossible now because the American people are too naive." Yes, the American people are still very naive, so they believe the lies spread to them under the guise of objective news about the imaginary "Red imperialism." Yes, the American people are still very naive, so they didn't send Mr. Ayer from the government to the asylum. However, the average American is not so naive to die for the dividends of crazy oil tycoons, arms dealers and other atomic merchants. The American people have brains, conscience, and humanity. They are now worried about the future, worried about the coming crisis, the greed of entrepreneurs, the rise in prices, and the rise of reactionary forces. They are not great politicians, but the average American is a living person. They want to live, to work, and to have fun. It is impossible to drive them back to military transport ships.
    The winter of mankind will not return
    Even if there is still a slight chill and bad weather ahead—the winter of mankind will not return. The city of London endured the terrible bombing winter and now lives through a dark, hungry, and poor winter after victory, not to return to the shameful days of "gentlemen's agreements," "non-interference policies," and Chamberlain and the like. The British people have experienced a lot, and they will not be willing to join the new "crusade" to be a poor drummer. British miners, metallurgists, and workers will not give speeches in Fulton. They cannot be responsible for those solo performances or harmonious duets. Who forces the people to forget the dark days of the occupation of France. The deaths of anti-enemy heroes, border guards and guerrillas, is it so that Paul, Reynaud or other gravediggers of France can translate the words of Wall Street into French "ATOUT (play) him"?
    Did the suffering and fighting of the people of Yugoslavia, Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Albania is for the purpose of allowing the displaced kings, generals, and gendarmes to migrate back to them, is it so that autonomous countries become the Philippines of Europe and Greece where Americans replace the British as supervisors?
    Ten years ago, I greeted May Day in Spain. The Spanish people bravely repelled the power of the fascists. Germany and Italy once supported the executioner Franco. Now there is a change here: Britain and the United States are supporting the executioner Franco. However, the Spanish people's war for their own freedom is continuing, and the people will win in this war.
    Only great poets can write the tragedy of the Greek people. This people once fought heroically against the fascist invaders. But after they won, they were deprived of their freedom, and were sent "good nannies" with good machine guns. Every day, Greek patriots are suffering and going to the execution ground, just like in the years of German occupation. However, the Greek people's war for their own freedom is continuing, and the people will win in this war.

　　自然法则
    爱伦堡
  　是谁呢？
    几百家美国报纸，英国保守党的几家机关报，一些被外国人收买去的法国报纸，他们每天写着：“俄国人——这是帝国主义者”，“苏联渴想扩张”，“莫斯科威胁和平”。一个老法子：贼跑走的时候高叫“捉贼！”是谁把手枪摆在桌上而讲和平？是谁在世界的五大洲建立军事基地？是谁干涉别国的内政，并且说别国人民为被保护者？是谁在进行或者秘密鼓励希腊的战争、印度尼西亚的战争、中国的战争，近东的战争？现在派往中国和土耳其，派往伊朗和希腊的是谁的大炮，谁的兵船，谁的教官和监督人？谁蔑视拿波里的美丽，马尼刺的雪茄，阿尔及耳的无线电台，上海贫民窟，阿左尔的岛屿，伊朗的石油，尼泊尔的蕴藏？谁公开干涉别国的内政，而说他“不能容纳共产主义者”？谁伪善地非难民主国家的选举，如南斯拉夫和保加利亚，而在自己家里却剥夺了千百万所谓“有色”公民的投票权？谁为了拯救蔡尔达里斯（希腊总理——译者），而咀咒杰斐逊（美国独立宣言起草人），为了帮助萨拉柴（葡萄牙总理——译者）而引用大西洋宪章，以及为了支持佛朗哥，而称赞塞万提斯的天才？谁在自己家里征集了所有的绞刑吏，所有的投降者，所有的典刑官——他们今天在大炮工厂工作，明天他们就将成为炮灰？他们屡屡谈起这些“迁移人物”，这些新的“十字军人”。说是迁移的法西斯主义，不是更好吗？
    渴望夺取某些国家的时候，他们是不受距离的限制的。“门罗主义”是反对欧洲人干涉美洲人的事，在决定派遣军事专家到鞑靼尼尔和爱琴海岸上去之后，美帝国主义者非常冷静地说：这——是——“门罗主义的发展”。他们想禁止欧洲人干预欧洲的事。也许他们会说，阿克罗波尔是在米苏里（美国的一个州）岸上的吧？如果热拿亚人在一四九二年发现了美洲，为什么芝加哥人在一九四七年不能“发现”阿蒂卡呢？……
    不久前，戴高乐将军曾经发表演说反对法兰西共和国。海那边的干爸爸并不过分挑剔，干儿子的印象也不坏。当一九四二年戴高乐将军代表法兰西国家的时候，美国人认为他比带着维希（抗德战争时期法奸伪政府所在地）水味的海军上将达尔朗好些。现在戴高乐代表着法兰西的反动派，布里特（就是竭力主张援蒋的那个美国坏蛋）也欢迎他。
    说高等的话遮下等的事
    美国的匪徒们，喜欢以高等的话来遮掩下等的事。当他们在密西西比州或乔治亚州用燃料油浇在黑人身上烧的时候，一批凶手吹起号角，另一批作着祈祷，第三批暗诵着“正义的胜利”，而在这件事情上不怜惜一加仑汽油的威严的人种论者的女儿，在唱感伤的罗曼斯曲。原子弹在比基尼岛试验之后，美国的伪君子们，为给炸死的山羊修建纪念碑而化去了大量的钱。是的，这些先生们的一个口袋里是炸弹，另一个口袋里是复活节的小鸡蛋。他们曾经说了这末多动人的话，并且现在也在说“援助希腊和土耳其的民主”，这种蜜糖，甚至连一切都看惯的瓦尔特·李普曼先生也恶心了。他写道：“美国的力量——是在海洋上和天空中。如果要与红军较量，我们就应当有不能离苏联重要中心过远的基地：唯一的战略通道，是由黑海到乌克兰及高加索。地中海东部、爱琴海和鞑靼尼尔海峡——这个黑海的门户……不应当再使自己负担那在本质上和通过的决议没有丝毫共同点的解释。谁也不能强迫我们‘援助’。不需要说‘民主’，因为大家都明白，现在的希腊政府，是‘民主’的最可怜的典型，而土耳其，她有一个十分受人‘尊敬’的政府，但不能称为民主的。白宫和国务院认为美国人民的战略主动尚未成熟，他们认为正当解决，应该是加油，加水，加糖，为的是使人民安心。照我的意见，他们就犯了这个错误。”
    让他们知道
    难道所有这些先生们都不了解，我们既能在希特勒军队面前屹立不动，我们会听了十来篇吓人的演说和成百篇窒息人的小文章而战抖吗？我知道，普通的美国人，对于美国国境以外现在发生的和过去已经发生过的一切，知道得多么少。让他们去尊敬一九一九年法西斯主义先驱者们对年青苏维埃共和国的行军吧。我们的国家，当时是衰弱而又无武装，而向着我们前进的列强们，给军事上的胜利冲昏了头脑。让普通的美国人知道奥德萨、阿尔汗格尔斯克、海参崴的我们当时是衰弱又无武装的，我们驱逐了侵略者，虽然我们没有能因为我们人民的受难而惩罚他们。实业界人士们还是相信，反苏维埃人民的战争，是不上算的企业，他们会得到代替红利的疡伤。四分之一世纪过去了。疯狂的德国上等兵（希特勒），一方面使自己的人民变得愚卤，一方面大规模地重演干涉者的野心。让普通美国人回忆这是怎样结束的：我们不仅驱逐了侵略者，我们也惩罚了他们。幻想在我们这里推行他们秩序的法西斯主义者，最初在劲子上得到了“勇士十字”章，而后来就是一根平常的绳子。让普通美国人看看烧焦的“十字章领得者”，想想德国坟墓上的十字架。斯大林格勒的人民是恫吓不了的。
    我们不是孤立的
    我们在为自由的斗争中，流了许多血。我们以自己的血，换来了胜利，救了自己和救了世界。不久之前，美国出版了狄那少将的一本书，他曾任美国驻莫斯科军事代表团的团长。这书题名为“奇异的盟邦”。是的，现在这位奇异的将军觉得两种人民的战斗同盟是“奇异的”。当我们屹立在伏尔加河上的时候，当我们把德国人从伏尔加驱逐到德伯河的时候，当美国人和英国人一起在享受红军的战斗所给与他们的太平的时候，两年的时光，我们才把最后的钮扣钉上了新的制服。那时候，狄那将军觉得苏联和美国的战斗同盟是十分自然的。他“奇异”的是我们胜利了，——这是出乎他意料之外的。
    为什么他失去了心灵的平衡、通辑和常识呢？有一首众人皆知的邱特切夫的诗：
    冬天不是徒然凶恶，
    是她临去的时光了——
    春天敲着窗子，
    在庭院里扫荡。
    凶恶的巫婆（指冬天）痴狂了，
    临走时抓起一堆雪，
    投向那美丽的孩子……
    春天的苦难很容易过去，
    她在雪里洗了一洗，
    不管敌人怎样凶猛，
    脸色反而更红润了。
    我马上要解释：在“纽约时报”，“每日电讯报”或“时代”（美国反动派的报纸和刊物）的文章里是无法洗的。然而邱特切夫所看到的巫婆却写得非常真实，巫婆之所以痴狂，因为是她临去的时光了。
    我们不是孤独的，同我们一起，有全欧洲人民。他们知道，在反抗可恶的法西斯主义者的斗争中，俄国人流了多少血。我在“欧洲之路”这本书里曾经说到，红军帮助解放了南斯拉夫和保加利亚。这就触怒了杰尔维斯先生，他在“纽约时报”中投来责备说：“我没有找到关于千百万金元，关于租借法案的叙述……”如何对这些半商半官的人解释，没有一本收支流水帐簿上是一页记着成渠的血液，而另一页上记着千百万金元的。欧洲有几百个城市里现在有“斯大林格勒街”，无论什么地方我都没有看见“租借法案街”……
    我们不是孤独的：同我们一起，有全世界的人民。反对我们的美国人，他们也反对美国人民。反对我们的英国人，他们也反对英国人民。反对我们的法国人，他们也反对法国人民。同我们一起，有一切的人民，因为我们是在保卫和平。我们在战争的年代中表现出我们能战；但这并不就是说我们喜欢战争。我们坚强地相信，母亲生儿子，不是为了“十字军”，人们造房子，不是为了炸弹，人民赢得可怕的反法西斯战争，不是为了使迁移的法西斯主义在过了几年之后再计划一次更可怕的大战。
    李普曼先生研究美国人已经成长到什么程度和没有成长到什么程度。普通美国人的政治眼光是有限的。普通美国人还没有成长到足以懂得李普曼先生和其他的“战略”爱好家们怎样每天愚弄他们三次。然而普通美国人已经成长到懂得常识的程度。这就是为什么美帝国主义者们竭力“加油加水加糖”到他们自己毫无人性的思想中去。这就是为什么美国人民，照李普曼先生的话，是“安定的”。艾尔先生曾经公开承认：“进攻苏联现在不可能，因为美国人民过于天真了。”是的，美国人民还很天真，所以他们相信那些在客观消息外貌之下对他们散播关于假想出来的“赤色帝国主义”的谎言。是的，美国人民还很天真，所以他们没有把艾尔先生从政府里送进疯人院。然而，要他们去为疯狂的石油商、军火商和其余的原子商人的红利送死，普通美国人就不这样天真了。美国人民有头脑、有良心、有人性。他们现在担心着未来，担心着行将来临的危机、企业家们的贪婪、物价的高涨和反动势力的高涨。他们不是什么了不起的政治家，但是普通美国人是活的人。他们要活，要工作，要娱乐。要将他们赶回军用运输舰上去是不可能的了。
    人类的冬天不会回来
    即使前面还有微寒和坏天气——人类的冬天不会回来的。伦敦城忍受惨酷轰炸的冬天和现在在胜利以后还过着阴暗、饥饿、贫穷的冬天，并不是为了要回到“绅士协定”、“不干涉政策”和张伯伦之流的可耻日子里。英国人民经历了许多，他们不会愿意参加新“十字军”去作一名可怜的吹鼓手。英国的矿工、冶金工人、职工都不会在富尔敦发表演说。无论对那些独唱表演或是谐和二重奏，他们都不能负责。谁迫使人民忘记占领法兰西年代的黑暗日子。抗敌英雄们，边防军和游击队之死，难道是为了让保罗、莱诺或别的法兰西的掘墓人把华尔街的话翻译为法国话“ＡＴＯＵＴ（打）他”吗？
    南斯拉夫、波兰、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、阿尔巴尼亚的人民的受苦和作战　，难道是为了让迁移的国王、将军和宪兵迁移回他们那里去，难道是为了自主的国家变成欧洲的菲律宾和由美国人取代英国人的监督者地位的希腊吗？
    十年前，我在西班牙迎接五一节。西班牙人民勇敢地打退了法西斯主义者的政权。德国和意大利曾经支持刽子手佛朗哥。现在这里又有了改变：英国和美国支持着刽子手佛朗哥。然而，西班牙人民为自己的自由而作的战争正在继续中，在这战争中胜利的将是人民。
    只有伟大的诗人才能够写出希腊人民的悲剧。这人民曾英勇地对法西斯侵略者抗争过。但当他们胜利之后，他们却被夺去了自由，而给他们派了带着好机关枪的“好保姆”。每一天，希腊的爱国者在受苦难，在走向刑场，好象在德国占领的年代一样。然而，希腊人民为自己的自由的战争正在继续中，在这战争中胜利的将是人民。
