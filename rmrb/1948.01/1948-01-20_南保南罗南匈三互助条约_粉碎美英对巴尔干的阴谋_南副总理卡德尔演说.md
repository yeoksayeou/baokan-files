Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. Belgrade Dispatch: Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj, after the Presidium of the Yugoslav People's Assembly approved the South-Bulgaria, South-Romania, and South-Hungary Treaties of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, made a speech stating: "These treaties have ended the long-term bloody conspiracy of imperialism in the Balkans and the Danube Basin, and destroyed the 'powder keg' arranged here by imperialism to enslave these countries." Kardelj pointed out: "This is the result of the long and tenacious anti-imperialist enslavement struggle of the people of the four countries. These treaties have also ended the political and economic subordinate status of the relevant nations." Kardelj pointed out: "Peace in the Balkans has not yet been finally established. Greece, as a victim of imperialist aggressors, its heroic people have now risen up to fight for freedom and independence. The fate of the Greek people is exactly the fate that imperialists want to impose on all Balkan people. But we want to warn these great gentlemen that it is absolutely impossible to return the Balkan people to the old way of life. No one, whether in Greece or other countries, can stop the final victory of the people who are fighting for themselves, for peace and the future, and for lasting peace and cooperation among nations."

　　南保南罗南匈三互助条约
    粉碎美英对巴尔干的阴谋
  　南副总理卡德尔演说
    【新华社陕北十七日电】贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫部长会议副主席卡德尔，近在南国人民议会主席团批准南保、南罗、南匈三友好合作互助条约后，发表演说称：“这些条约已结束了帝国主义在巴尔干与多脑河盆地的长期的血腥阴谋，毁灭了帝国主义为奴役这些国家而在这里安排下的“火药库”。卡氏指出：“这是四国人民进行长期而顽强的、反帝国主义奴役斗争的结果。这些条约亦结束了各有关民族在政治经济上的附属国地位”。卡氏指出：“巴尔干和平尚未最后奠定，作为帝国主义侵略者的牺牲品的希腊，其英勇人民现在已经起来，为争取自由独立而战斗着。希腊人民的命运，就正是帝国主义者所欲加之于所有巴尔干人民的命运。但我们要正告这些大人先生们，要巴尔干人民回复到旧的生活方式去，是决不可能的，不论在希腊或其他国家内，任何人都阻止不了为自己、为和平与未来、为各国间持久和平与合作而战斗着的人民的最后胜利。”
