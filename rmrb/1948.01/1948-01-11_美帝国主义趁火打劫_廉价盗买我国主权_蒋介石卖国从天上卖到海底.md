　　American Imperialism Exploits the Crisis
  　Plundering Our Sovereignty at Low Prices
    Chiang Kai-shek Sells Out the Nation from the Sky to the Seabed
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th] Recently, during the repeated negotiations between American imperialism and the Chiang bandits, the former took advantage of the latter's increasing difficulties and crisis to intensify its exploitation. According to various sources, American imperialism has made demands to the Chiang bandits for various "preferential rights" to thoroughly destroy China, and the Chiang bandit Kai-shek has completely agreed. The United States has decided to greatly expand its military advisory group in China and greatly increase the powers of the group, including completely controlling the Chiang bandit army's training institutions and the entire command of the Chiang gang bandit army. To adapt to this plan, the United States has decided to send Major General Baer, the Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of personnel of the US Ground Forces Headquarters, to China to replace the current head of the US Military Advisory Group in China, Rooks, who has left China and returned to the United States. It is said that the US military advisory group will be increased to at least about 5,600 people. Moreover, the Nanjing radio broadcast on December 12 confirmed that in the "Naval Agreement" signed between the Chiang family bandit gang and the United States, the sovereignty of the naval base has been completely sold out to American imperialism. The broadcast stated that the agreement stipulates that Chiang and the United States will "jointly defend the Pacific coast and help consolidate Pacific bases," which means allowing the US Navy to completely occupy the Chinese coast and placing the Chiang bandit's entire navy under direct American control. In addition, on December 12, Chiang bandit Foreign Minister Wang Shijie publicly stated at the Nanjing "State Council" meeting that he would follow the US policy in dealing with the issue of recognizing the new pro-fascist government. After American imperialism obtained the guarantee from the Chiang bandits to sell out China's national sovereignty, the US Congress passed a not-so-surprising $18 million on December 19 as so-called "temporary assistance" to Chiang Kai-shek. Moreover, the use of this meager amount will be supervised by the United States.

　　美帝国主义趁火打劫
  　廉价盗买我国主权
    蒋介石卖国从天上卖到海底
    【新华社陕北八日电】最近美帝国主义和蒋匪屡次谈判中，利用蒋匪日益增加的困难危机，放手加紧趁火打劫。据各方消息披露：美帝国主义曾向蒋匪提出彻底灭亡中国的各种“特惠权”的要求，蒋匪介石已完全同意。美国已决定将其驻华军事顾问团大加扩充，并将该团职权大大提高，其中包括彻底掌握蒋匪陆军训练机构，并掌握蒋帮匪军的全部指挥权。为适应此项计划，美国已决定派遣现任美国地面部队总司令部综管人事之少将副参谋长巴尔来华，接替现任驻华美军事顾问团团长鲁克斯，鲁克斯已离华返美。据说美军顾问团将增至最少五千六百人左右。并且十二月十二日的南京电台广播，证实了蒋家匪帮与美国签订之“海军协定”中，已将海军基地主权全部断送给美帝国主义。该广播供称：协定已规定蒋美“共同保卫太平洋海岸和帮助巩固太平洋基地”，这就是说让美国海军完全占有中国海岸，并将蒋匪全部海军置于美国直接操纵下。此外，十二月十二日蒋匪外交部长王世杰在南京“国务会议”上公开声称：对待还罗法西斯新政权问题上将遵照美国的政策。美帝国主义在得到了蒋匪出卖中国各项国家主权的保证后，美国国会已于十二月十九日通过数目并不惊人的一千八百万美元，作为对蒋介石所谓“临时援助”。并且这区区数目，还要由美国监督其使用。
