　　Selling National Sovereignty for American Imperialist Aid
　　Chiang Kai-shek's Big Comprador Bei Zuyi Goes to the United States to Wag His Tail and Beg for Favors
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: According to Washington sources, the so-called technical delegation of Chiang Kai-shek's clique, headed by the big comprador Bei Zuyi, has been actively lobbying since arriving in Washington on the 16th, seeking aid from its American masters in exchange for treasonous conditions. Before his departure, Bei Zuyi had specially collected data on the economic, financial, transportation, agricultural, forestry, and resource aspects of the Chiang-controlled areas, which he took with him to the United States. In the first meeting between Bei and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Thorp and others on the 19th, the Director of the Investment Development Division of the U.S. Department of State, Haverly, participated. On the day of Bei's arrival in the United States, Hunter, a former U.S. diplomat in China and now a well-known U.S. exporter to China, spoke on behalf of major American monopolists, calling for American capital to be invested in railways, factories, agriculture, and forestry in South China. A few days before Bei's arrival, on January 9th, Kong Xiangxi, one of the four major financial magnates of Chiang Kai-shek's clique, openly told American capitalists at the "Far East Industrial and Commercial Association Committee" (formerly the "Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Association") in the United States that as long as the United States gave Chiang Kai-shek's clique "appropriate assistance," the Chiang government would encourage and protect foreign (American) capital, "allowing it to participate in the general development of China's latent natural resources." He Yingqin, another reactionary ringleader of Chiang Kai-shek's clique remaining in the United States, also shamelessly proposed in a speech in Ligonier to exchange China's natural resources and manpower, as well as China's important strategic bases, for American dollars. All this indicates that the exchange condition for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's begging for American aid is the sale of all of China's sovereignty.

　　出卖全国主权换取美帝援助
  　蒋匪大买办贝祖诒到美国去摇尾乞怜
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】据华盛顿消息：蒋匪的所谓技术代表团，以大买办贝祖诒为首，于十六日抵达华盛顿后，正积极活动，以卖国条件换取其美国主子的援助。贝祖诒启程前，曾特别搜集了蒋区经济、财政、交通、农林、资源等各方面的资料，携住美国。贝等十九日Ａ与美助理国务卿索尔甫等所举行的第一次会议中，有美国务院投资开发司司长海佛立克参加。在贝等抵达美国的当天，前美驻华外交人员现为美国著名对华出口商的亨特，即代表美国大独占资本家呼吁，应以美国资本投入华南铁路、工厂和农林等事业中。贝等到达的前几天，即一月九日，蒋匪四大财阀之一孔祥熙，在美国；“远东工商业协会委员会”（前身为“中美工商业协会”）上，公开告诉美国资本家说：只要美国给蒋匪以“适当援助”，蒋政府将鼓励和保护外（美）资，“使之参加中国潜藏的天然资源的一般开发”。蒋匪另一个留在美国的反动头子何应钦，在立棋莫特地方的演说中，也恬不知耻地提议，以中国的天然富源和人力以及中国的重要战略基地换取美金。这一切都表示，卖国贼蒋介石乞求美国援助的交换条件，即是全中国主权的出卖。
