Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Moscow Radio recently broadcast Marcinow's commentary on the Chiang government's recent "economic emergency measures," stating: The Kuomintang has recently announced so-called emergency measures and established a "Financial Control Bureau." Kuomintang spokesmen claim that the establishment of this agency is intended to sanction speculators and stabilize prices. Similar emergency measures were announced in great numbers last spring, but the result was even more severe inflation and speculation. At the end of the year before last, the total amount of currency in circulation was 7 trillion yuan; by last spring, it had reached 18 trillion yuan, causing the legal tender to depreciate eightfold and the cost of living to increase tenfold. The Kuomintang's budget also increased further, which was the result of implementing emergency financial measures.

To shirk responsibility for this unprecedented bankruptcy, the Kuomintang reactionary authorities falsely claimed that it was due to the sabotage of the Chinese Communist Party. However, the Chinese people know that the Kuomintang authorities are the real culprits behind the financial and economic crisis in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. People only need to compare the different economic situations in the two regions of China to expose the Kuomintang reactionaries' absurd rumors and slanders. The Liberated Areas are economically relatively backward regions, not only suffering from the attacks of the Kuomintang army but also subject to economic blockade. However, the Liberated Areas can be self-reliant without foreign aid, and there is no hyperinflation or economic crisis. Conversely, the Kuomintang-controlled areas include major industrial, financial, and commercial regions, and they enjoy substantial aid from the United States, yet they are increasingly mired in economic bankruptcy. The reason for the difference between these two regions is that they are implementing two different policies: the achievements of the Liberated Areas in revitalizing and developing the national economy are primarily due to the establishment of a genuine democratic government here. Conversely, the Kuomintang-controlled areas are ruled by a reactionary government. The American magazine *Amerasia* pointed out that those in power should be held responsible for the crisis. In Kuomintang China, those bureaucratic economic groups who control economic and political power use their power and the huge private monopolies supported by the government to seize economic dominance in China. A Chinese economist wrote in the *Far Eastern Economic Review* that Kuomintang monopoly capitalists use military and political power, manipulate import and export and banking privileges, buy goods at low prices, and sell them at high prices, obtaining huge profits. They are waging an anti-democratic civil war for these super-profits. Kuomintang monopoly capitalists have also engaged in strangling China's productive forces – China's national industry and commerce and agriculture. To feed their own army and police, maintain a huge bureaucracy, and ensure the super-profits of the four big families, they ruthlessly exploit the wealth of the Chinese people. The inflation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the poverty and famine suffered by the people, and the massive bankruptcy of national industry and commerce are the sources of wealth for the four big feudal comprador families. And the Kuomintang's many measures nominally aimed at curbing speculation are the reasons for increasing speculation and accelerating the crisis. In reality, this is merely transferring the power of speculation to speculators and the power to supervise prices to those who monopolize currency. The power of the newly established Financial Control Bureau is also entirely in the hands of the Kuomintang financial magnates who are getting rich. This new agency is clearly not fighting against prices but fighting for the profits of the four big families.

### 蒋党成立“金融管理局”　实际是为四大家族发财  马西努评蒋家“经济紧急措施”

　　蒋党成立“金融管理局”
  　实际是为四大家族发财
    马西努评蒋家“经济紧急措施”
    【新华社陕北六日电】莫斯科电台近发表马西努对蒋政府最近的“经济紧急措施”评论称：国民党最近又宣布了所谓非常设施，成立“金融管理局”。国民党发言人声称：他们成立这个机关，是希望制裁投机商人和稳定物价。象这样的非常措施在去年春天曾宣布过一大串，结果通货膨胀和投机更加厉害了。前年年底流通钞总额为七万亿元，去年春天已达到了十八万亿元，于是法币价格下跌八倍，生活费则增加了十倍，国民党的预算也更加增加了，这就是实施非常财政设施的结果。
    国民党反动当局为了卸脱这种空前破产应负的责任，就撒谎说这是由于中国共产党的破坏。可是中国人民都知道，国民党当局是国民党统治区财政经济危机的真正罪人。人们只要比较一下中国两种地区不同的经济情况，就能揭穿国民党反动派造谣诽谤的无稽。解放区在经济上是比较落后的地区，不仅遭受着国民党军队的进攻，且受着经济上的封锁，但解放区并无外国援助而能自力更生，在解放区没有恶性通货膨胀和经济危机；相反的，国民党统治区是包括着主要工业和金融商业的区域，它享受着美国方面的大量援助，可是他们却日益陷入了经济破产的泥沼中。这两个区域所以不同，是由于两个区域实行着两种不同的政策：解放区在复兴和发展国民经济方面的成绩，首先是由于在这里成立了真正的民主政权，相反的国民党统治区是反动政府当权。美国的美亚杂志曾指出那些掌握政权的人，对危机应该负起责任，在国民党中国，那些掌握经济和政治权力的官僚、经济集团，他们利用权势及由政府扶持的庞大私人的垄断，夺取了在中国的经济地位。中国一位经济学家在“远东经济评论”杂志上著文指出：国民党独占资本家利用军事和政治大权，利用操纵进出口和银行特权，按低价收买货物，再以高价出卖，获得巨大利润，他们正是为了这超额利润而进行着反民主的内战。国民党独占资本家同时还进行了绞杀中国生产力——中国民族工商业及农业的工作。他们为了饲养自己的军队和警察，为了维持庞大的官僚机关，为了四大家族的超额利润，而残忍的剥削中国人民的财富。国民党统治区的通货膨胀，人民遭受贫困和饥荒、民族工商业大批破产，这就是四大封建买办家族发财致富的来源。而国民党名为制裁投机的许多措施，就是增加投机和推进危机的原因，实际上这只不过是将投机的权力转交给投机分子，把物价的监督权力转交给那些垄断货币的分子。现在新设金融管理局的权力，也是完全掌握在发财致富的国民党财政大王手中的，这个新机构显然不是与物价作斗争，而是为四大家族的利润而斗争。
