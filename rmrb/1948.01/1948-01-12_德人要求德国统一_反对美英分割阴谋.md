Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th dispatch: Berlin News: A mass movement demanding German unification and a just peace is vigorously unfolding throughout Germany. The Ruhr and Rhine District Committee of the German Communist Party recently issued a declaration calling on "all German people to form a strong democratic national united front, to fight for a unified German Republic, and to fight against the establishment of any West German government." People's Congresses demanding German unification have been held successively in various parts of the Soviet occupation zone. This movement has even spread to the smallest villages. Trade union leaders and factory committee members of the Chemnitz district recently held a joint meeting, deciding to organize People's Congress committees in all factories. The demand for democratic unification of Germany is also a widespread call in the western occupation zones. According to the Berlin News, when 10,000 residents in the Rhine and Ruhr areas of the British occupation zone were asked, 76 percent of them favored German unification. People's Congresses have been scheduled to be held successively in Bremen, Düsseldorf, Bavaria, Munich and other places this month. The call of the Communist Party in the French occupation zone to convene a People's Congress has received widespread support from the people in the area. The Executive Bureau of the German Social Democratic Party, listening to the will of the United States and Britain, has once again used its usual tricks to prohibit its members from participating in the People's Congress, but young Social Democrats are becoming increasingly aware and are actively participating in the German unification movement. The Berlin District Committee of the Social Democratic youth group "Young Eagles" passed a resolution opposing all attempts to harbor party bias and ignore the will of the majority of the people.

　　德人要求德国统一
  　反对美英分割阴谋
    【新华社陕北十日电】柏林讯：要求德国统一及正义和平的群众运动，正在全德蓬勃展开。德共鲁尔、莱茵区党委顷发表宣言，号召“全体德国人民结成强大的民主民族阵线，为统一的德国共和国而斗争，为反对成立任何西德政府而斗争。”要求德国统一的人民代表大会，已在苏占区各地陆续举行。这一运动并已扩展到最小的乡村。柴斯区工会领袖与职工会工厂委员会委员最近举行联席会议，决定在一切工厂组织人民代表大会委员会。要求德国民主统一，也是西部占领区普遍的呼声。据柏林新闻讯：英占区莱茵和鲁尔区一万居民在答复问题时，其中百分之七十六赞成德国统一。不来梅、杜塞尔多夫、巴伐利亚、慕尼黑等地，都已决定在本月陆续召开人民代表大会。法占区共产党召开人民代表大会的呼吁，已得到该区人民广泛的支持。听从美英意志的德国社会民主党执行局，又施展惯技，禁止该党党员参加人民代表大会，但是年青的社会党人都日益觉悟，纷纷参加德国统一运动。社会民主党青年团体“苍鹰”柏林区党委曾通过决议，反对一切存有党见而忽视大多数人民意志的企图。
