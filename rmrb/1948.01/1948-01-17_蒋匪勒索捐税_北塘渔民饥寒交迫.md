Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. According to news from the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas: Beitang in Bohai Bay, Tianjin, a famous fish-producing area in China, has become impossible for the vast number of fishermen to live in due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities' control of the fishing industry and the levying of exorbitant taxes and levies. Beitang fishermen originally had more than 1,600 boats, but now only have 580 due to their inability to repair them. The exorbitant taxes and levies have also made it impossible for fishermen to live. In Dongheyan, Beitang, there is an old fishing household with 21 people, 6 of whom are able to work. Their annual income is 13.5 million yuan (Chiang Kai-shek currency), while their minimum annual living expenses are 14.4 million yuan, a shortfall of 900,000 yuan, but they still have to bear 700,000 to 800,000 yuan (Chiang Kai-shek currency) in "public funds" for the Chiang Kai-shek local government. This forces fishermen to borrow money everywhere and sell their furniture and belongings, unable to sustain even one meal a day.

　　蒋匪勒索捐税
  　北塘渔民饥寒交迫
    【新华社陕北十四日电】据蒋区消息：中国著名产鱼区天津渤海北塘，因蒋匪当局统制渔业及勒征苛捐杂税，广大渔民已无法生活。北塘渔民原有船只一千数百只，因无力修补，现仅有五百八十只。苛捐杂税又使渔民无法生活，北塘东河沿有一老渔户，家有二十一口人，能生产者六人，全年收入为一千三百五十万元（蒋币），全年最低生活费为一千四百四十万元，不敷九十万，但仍要负担蒋匪地方政府“公款”七八十万元（蒋币）。因此迫使渔民到处借贷，变卖家具什物，每日不能维持一餐。
