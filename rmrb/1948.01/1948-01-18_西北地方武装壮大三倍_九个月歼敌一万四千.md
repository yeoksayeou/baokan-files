Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th: The Northwest Joint Defense Headquarters recently announced the battle results of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region's local armed forces, guerrillas, and militia in the past nine months (from March 12 to the end of the year) as follows: (1) 3,064 battles fought, annihilating 14,013 enemies, including 4,919 killed or wounded, 8,274 captured alive, and 820 who revolted and surrendered. According to the regular establishment of the enemy army, the number of enemies annihilated is equivalent to two brigades, two regiments, and two battalions. (2) 8 enemy officers at the regimental level, 14 at the battalion level, and 67 at the company and platoon level were captured alive. (3) Captured one mountain gun, one rocket launcher, and 27 artillery pieces of various calibers, 89 grenade launchers and rifle grenade launchers, 231 machine guns of various types, 3,709 rifles and pistols, 2,752 artillery shells, 9,673 grenades, rifle grenades, and hand grenades, 538,377 rounds of ammunition, 264 war horses, 1,166 livestock, 3 radio stations, 3 reporting machines, 42 telephones, 3,604 *shi* of grain, and a portion of other military supplies, and 25 vehicles. Destroyed 1,671碉堡 fortifications, two bridges, and shot down two airplanes.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th: General Wang Weizhou, Deputy Commander of the Northwest Joint Defense Army, spoke on the battle achievements of the local armed forces in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region over the past nine months, saying: During the same period that the Northwest People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 61,000 enemies, our local armed forces and guerrillas also annihilated more than 14,000 enemies. Now, not only is the field army much stronger than in the past, but the local armed forces have also grown more than threefold. The enemies on the Northwest battlefield have become increasingly weakened and insignificant in the face of our tremendous military victories. Deputy Commander Wang recalled that in these nine months, the people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region transitioned from ten years of peaceful life to all-out war, which was a major transformation and test. However, the people of the Border Region, tempered by the Land Revolution War, were not frightened by the ferocious enemy, but quickly organized themselves, armed themselves, and resolutely eliminated all invading bandit troops. Now the enemy has not only lost a lot of soldiers and equipment, but also been forced into a defensive position. In the future, our field army will attack and eliminate large groups of enemies, while our local armed forces will eliminate small groups of enemies and surround and harass isolated enemies.

Deputy Commander Wang summarized the current situation between the enemy and us, saying: The Chiang-Hu bandit troops are now only trapped in isolated cities and some narrow areas such as Yan'an, Ganquan, ＠ County, Qingyang, Heshui, Zhenyuan, Yanchi, Dingbian, and Anbian, while vast areas have been recovered by us. The original Border Region now has the following county towns (including newly established counties) in our hands: Suide, Mizhi, Qingjian, Wubao, ＠ County, Zizhou, Zhenchuan, Hengshan, Yanchuan, Yanchang, Gulin, Zichang, Ansai, Zhidan, Jingbian, Wuqi, Huanxian, Quzi, Huachi, Xinzheng, Xinmin, Chishui, Chunyao, and other more than 20 cities, and with the continuous attacks of our local armed forces, new liberated areas have been developed and many new democratic regimes have been established. In the Guanzhong sub-district, in addition to expanding the three new districts of Tuqiao, Guanzhuang, and Liangzhuang in Chishui County, the people's power has been newly established in the four counties of Zhong (bu) Yi (jun), Gouyi, ＠ County, and Sanyuan, and the area has expanded almost doubled compared to the past. In the Yuheng area, in addition to expanding several districts and townships in ＠ County and Zhenchuan, the city of Shenmu has also been liberated, and the decrees of the democratic regime can directly reach the suburbs of Yulin. The Huanglong Mountain area, a military stronghold of the Chiang-Hu bandit army, is also controlled by our guerrillas, and the reactionary Baojia system has been destroyed in many villages in the area, and people's armed forces and political power have been established. The 120,000 people of Huanglong Mountain, who have been squeezed by the Chiang-Hu bandit army for many years, will more actively participate in the struggle.

Deputy Commander Wang then made an appropriate analysis and assessment of the great role of the local armed forces in the nine-month self-defense war, pointing out: (1) They cooperated with the main force to strike and contain the enemy, and recovered and controlled the enemy-occupied areas. For example, our local armed forces fought 3,064 battles in nine months, annihilating 14,013 enemies, averaging about eleven battles per day, and annihilating more than fifty enemies per day. This frequent and proactive attack, the tactic of accumulating small victories into big victories, made it difficult for the enemy to move, often being beaten, and increasingly weakened. Our local armed forces can also use tactics of concentrating forces and joint attacks to achieve victory. For example, the Chunyao guerrillas captured Shipo, the ＠ County, Ganquan, and Zhidan county guerrillas captured Zhangcun and Zhiluozhen, the Yan'an guerrillas attacked Lijiaqu, and the Ansai guerrillas attacked Yandianzi and Xiaobiangou, forcing the Chiang-Hu bandits to shrink their occupied areas and retreat to isolated cities. The enemy once attempted to concentrate its forces to "suppress" the suburbs, but it was crushed by our guerrillas who dispersed and persisted in the struggle in their original locations. At present, our local armed forces are still active in the near suburbs of Yan'an City, and leaflets and slogans are still transmitted to the urban area as usual. In addition, guerrillas participated in battles such as Yangmahe, Panlong, and Chakou. A certain unit of the Suide local corps encircled and annihilated the Hu bandit assault division, and a certain unit of the Sanbian local corps repulsed the fleeing enemy Ma bandit Bao Fourth Regiment, which played a direct cooperative role. (2) They attacked the Chiang area, destroyed the Baojia system, and expanded and established new liberated areas. For example, the Guanzhong sub-district and Yuheng area have been expanded, and democratic regimes have been established in the vast villages of the Huanglong Mountain area. When our army besieged Hancheng, the local masses mobilized 500 carts and hundreds of stretchers to help us transport supplies and rescue the wounded. (3) They persisted in the anti-"suppression" struggle and protected the safety of the masses. Guerrillas in various places covered the transfer of the masses during the "suppression" by the Chiang-Hu bandit army, armed and defended production, and cracked down on the enemy's conspiracies and atrocities of looting grain, conscripting men, and merging villages.

Finally, Deputy Commander Wang encouraged the local armed forces in the Border Region to work harder on the basis of victory, avoid complacency, and further cooperate with the main force in an organized and planned manner to eliminate the Chiang-Hu bandit army in the Border Region and welcome the victorious 1948.

　　西北地方武装壮大三倍
  　九个月歼敌一万四千
    【新华社西北十六日电】西北联防军司令部顷公布陕甘宁边区地方武装、游击队及民兵去年九个月（自三月十二日至年底）战绩如下：（一）作战三千零六十四次，歼敌一万四千零一十三名，内毙伤敌四千九百一十九名，生俘八千二百七十四名，起义投诚八百二十名。按照敌军正规编制计算，歼敌数目相等于两个旅两个团又两个营。（二）生俘敌团级军官八名，营级军官十四名，连排级军官六十七名。（三）缴获山炮、火箭炮各一门及各种口径炮二十七门，掷弹筒及枪榴弹筒共八十九个，各种机枪二百三十一挺，长短枪三千七百零九支，炮弹二千七百五十二发，掷弹、枪榴弹及手榴弹共九千六百七十三颗，子弹五十三万八千三百七十七发，战马二百六十四匹，牲口一千一百六十六匹，电台三部，话报机三部，电话机四十二部，粮食三千六百零四石及其他军用品一部，汽车二十五辆。摧毁碉堡工事一千六百七十一座，桥梁二座，击毁飞机二架。
    【新华社西北十六日电】西北联防军副司令员王维舟将军，对九个月来陕甘宁边区地方武装战绩发表谈话说：在西北人民解放军歼敌六万一千多人的同一期间，我地方武装和游击队也歼敌一万四千多人。现在不仅野战军比过去强大得多，地方武装也壮大了三倍以上。西北战场上的敌人在我们军事的巨大胜利面前，变得日益衰弱和渺小了。王副司令员回忆这九个多月中，陕甘宁边区人民从十年的和平生活转到全面战争，这是一个重大的转变和考验。但是经过土地革命战争锻炼出来的边区人民，并没有被张牙舞爪的敌人吓退，而是迅速地组织起来，武装起来，坚决消灭一切进犯匪军。现在敌人不但损失了很多兵员和装备，而且被迫处于防御地位。今后我们的野战军将进攻并消灭大股的敌人，我们的地方武装，则消灭小股敌人和围困袭扰孤立的敌人。
    王副司令员概述目前敌我形势说：蒋胡匪军现在仅困守延安、甘泉、＠县、庆阳、合水、镇原、盐池、定边、安边等孤城和一些狭窄地带，广大地区都被我收复。原边区现在我手中的县城（包括新设县）有：绥德、米脂、清涧、吴堡、＠县、子洲、镇川、横山、延川、延长、固临、子长、安塞、志丹、靖边、吴旗、环县、曲子、华池、新正、新民、赤水、淳耀等二十余城，并且在我地方武装不断出击下，发展了新解放区，建立许多新的民主政权。关中分区除赤水县扩大了土桥、官庄、梁庄三个新区，新正县除收复了二十九年被蒋胡匪军侵占的五六两区外，并新建立了中（部）宜（君）、枸邑、＠县、三原四个县的人民政权，地区比较过去扩大了几近一倍。榆横方面除＠县、镇川扩大若干区乡外，并解放了神木县城，民主政权的政令可以直达榆林城郊。蒋胡匪军军事要地黄龙山区也被我游击队控制，已在该地许多乡村里摧毁了反动的保甲制度，建立了人民的武装和政权。被蒋胡匪军压榨多年的黄龙山十二万人民将更加积极的参加斗争。
    王副司令员继对九个月自卫战争中，地方武装的巨大作用，作了恰当的分析和估计，他指出：（一）配合主力打击和牵制了敌人，收复和控制了敌占区。如我地方武装九个月作战三千零六十四次，歼敌一万四千零十三名，平均每天作战约十一次，每天歼敌在五十人以上，这种频繁主动的袭击，积小胜为大胜的战术，使敌人行动困难，时常挨打，日益削弱。我地方武装并能运用集中力量、联合进攻的战术，取得胜利。如淳耀游击队攻克市坡，＠县、甘泉、志丹三县游击队攻克张村、直罗镇，延安游击队袭入李家渠，安塞游击队袭入阎店子、小砭沟，迫使蒋胡匪不得不缩小占领地区，退守孤城。敌人曾经企图集中兵力“清剿”城郊，但在我游击队化整为零，坚持原地斗争下，遭到粉碎。目前我地方武装仍活跃在延安市近郊，传单标语照常传到市区内。此外如羊马河、蟠龙、岔口等战役中，游击队均参加作战。绥德地方兵团某部围歼胡匪突击师，三边地方兵团某部击溃逃敌马匪保四团，都起了直接的配合作用。（二）出击蒋区，摧毁保甲，扩大与建立了新解放区。如关中分区、榆横地区均已扩大，黄龙山区广大乡村亦已建立民主政权。在我军围攻韩城时，当地群众就动员了五百辆大车，数百付担架，帮助我转运物资，救护伤员。（三）坚持反“清剿”斗争，保护群众安全。各地游击队在蒋胡匪军“清剿”中掩护群众转移，武装保卫生产，打击了敌人抢粮、抓丁、并村的阴谋与暴行。
    最后王副司令员勉励边区地方武装，在胜利的基础上加倍努力，切忌骄傲自满，应进一步有组织有计划的配合主力，消灭蒋胡匪军于边区内，迎接胜利的一九四八年。
