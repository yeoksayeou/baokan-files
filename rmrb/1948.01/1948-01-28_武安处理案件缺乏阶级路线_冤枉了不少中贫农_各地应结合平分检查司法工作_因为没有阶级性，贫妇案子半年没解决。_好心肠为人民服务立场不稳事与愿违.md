[Our Newspaper's News] It is important to clarify the composition of newly reformed individuals and the nature of their crimes, and to see if the masses have been wronged. A reporter investigated the Wuan detention center. According to Director Gao, as of January 21, among the 77 newly reformed individuals, 12 were poor peasants, 23 were middle peasants (including one local tyrant), 12 were rich peasants, and 31 were landlords. Poor and middle peasants accounted for 45 percent of the total. This was the situation after the detention center checked their class status. Looking further back, the problems were even greater. In the last ten days of October last year, there were 28 poor peasant newly reformed individuals, 27 middle peasants, 13 rich peasants, and 26 landlords, totaling 94. Poor and middle peasants accounted for more than 58 percent. What crimes did they commit? According to Director Gao, based on their confessions: Xu Gengde (female), a poor peasant from Nancangjing Village, experienced a famine in 1943, and her family could not survive. Her husband, Cao Guo, left home without a word. Initially, someone in the village saw him in Nanyangyi, but there has been no news since. In 1945, Cao Baogui sued Xu Gengde, claiming she killed her husband. Cao Baogui was a landlord and a special agent, and also served as a militiaman. He was Xu Gengde's uncle. Earlier, he had given Xu Gengde's family eight mu of land. During rent reduction and debt liquidation, he wanted to reclaim the land, but Xu Gengde refused. This sowed deep hatred. The government initially did not clarify these matters and detained Xu Gengde for six or seven months. Later, after things were clarified, Xu Gengde was released. Upon returning home, she had nothing to eat or burn. Political Director Pei Chengcai took the opportunity to find her to sleep with, but she refused. The Political Director also gave her money, but she refused and even cursed him. From this, the Political Director hated her deeply. In June of last year, out of nowhere, cadres wanted to revisit "old cases" and insisted that Cao Guo was killed by Xu Gengde. They hung Xu Gengde seven times and beat her until she was black and blue, even threatening to burn her with a branding iron, forcing her to "confess." Unable to withstand the torture, Xu Gengde made a false confession, even implicating her lover, Zhao Yu, saying that they both murdered Cao Guo. The cadres then convicted them of "adultery and murder," confiscated Xu Gengde's property, and sent them to the detention center twice. Zhao Yu is also a poor peasant, who had nothing at home since childhood. He relied on doing small jobs for neighbors to eat from the age of eight or nine. Later, he went outside to mend pots for others for twelve years. He then repaired bicycles in a bicycle shop. After seven or eight years, he borrowed a house, rented four or five mu of land, and returned home to farm. He never managed to marry a wife. He and Xu Gengde had been lovers for eleven years. He was also imprisoned in the detention center for the first time because of Cao Baogui's accusation. Cao Baogui believed that Zhao Yu was behind Xu Gengde's refusal to let him reclaim the land. He was determined to punish him, but could not find any fault with him, so he went to the district cadres and said that Cao Guo was killed by Zhao Yu and Xu Gengde. (Last June, the village found out that Cao Baogui was a special agent, and he confessed to this, saying that Zhao Yu killing the man was "not true, the man left.") The district cadre questioned Zhao Yu for a while and then went to exhume the body. They dug for a morning without finding anything. They went again in the evening. At this time, Xu Gengde said to search Cao Baogui's body first, but Cao Baogui refused. As a result, two bones were found, but the masses did not say anything. Later, district cadre Li Yumin said, "The bones are wrong, they are not human bones." At that time, Zhao Yu had already been sent to the detention center and had been detained for two months before being released on bail due to illness. After returning to the village, he did not dare to have a relationship with Xu Gengde. Last June, Xu Gengde's case was "revisited." A district worker asked Zhao Yu about the murder, and Zhao Yu said that he did not kill anyone. They ordered him to take off his clothes and tied him up, put a branding iron next to him, and told him to "confess." He was afraid and had no choice but to "confess." In this way, he was sent to the detention center again. Another wrongly accused newly reformed individual is Zhang Lizhen, who is from Longwu Village and is 25 years old this year. His father used to beg for food and work as a hired laborer before renting hillside land in Xianling Village and settling down. Zhang Lizhen started working part-time for others at the age of twelve. When he was eighteen, his father died, and his mother remarried. From then on, he had no one and no home, and life was unbearable. At the age of twenty, he carved inkstones and made counterfeit money, but he failed, and the village reported him. He was sentenced to three months of imprisonment by the Third Special District Commissioner's Office. After returning to the village, he joined the army. Soon, he deserted. Unable to survive at home, he stole two dou of corn from Li Dongfang, and after being found out, he was fined a quilt. At the age of twenty-one, he couldn't survive in the village, so he went to the Northeast and worked in the Fengtian Iron Mine. Later, he made and sold pots in a pot factory. Later, he worked as a worker in a cigarette company. Later, he worked as a laborer on the street. In May of the year before last, he went around Shanghai, Nanjing, and Xuzhou before heading home. Passing through Zhangde, he was captured by the troops of the traitor Li Ying and detained for five days before being incorporated into Sun Dianying's troops. In September, he deserted in Huixian. He suffered in Tunzhuang, Tangyin, hauling water and feeding livestock for others. Last May, he went to Cuijiatian's shop to roll cigarettes for others for three months. After the village was liberated, he was sent to the Wuan detention center because he was an outsider. What laws did these people who have suffered all their lives break? The Judicial Section asked a lot of questions but did not base their judgment on these confessions, quickly clarify their cases, release them, and allow them to enjoy a democratic and free life. Some newly reformed individuals, such as Liu Tianmin, a poor man from Chengguan, have clear cases, and the Judicial Section has said they would release them. However, because he has no land or house, not even chopsticks, he is unwilling to go home and prefers to stay in the detention center. This is truly a desperate situation. The Judicial Section has not made any suggestions to the local government to solve his difficulties. These situations, where people are not being properly held responsible, are worth examining. It should be stated here that, with the deepening of the land reform movement, the comrades working in the detention center are also working hard to explore the path of the class line and have already achieved results. For example, due to class differentiation, the lives of poor and middle peasant newly reformed individuals have been improved, and the destructive activities of landlord newly reformed individuals have been cracked down. However, because the concept of class is not clear, and they did not first see if the masses had been wronged and quickly resolve these wrongful cases, as a result, so many people are still detained in the detention center, living a life without freedom. This should attract our greatest attention, and we should thoroughly inspect and improve judicial work.

　　武安处理案件缺乏阶级路线
  　冤枉了不少中贫农
  　各地应结合平分检查司法工作
  　因为没有阶级性，贫妇案子半年没解决。
  　好心肠为人民服务立场不稳事与愿违
    【本报消息】把自新人的成份弄清楚，罪名弄清楚，看是不是冤枉了群众，记者到武安看守所调查了一下。听高所长说：到一月二十一日为止，全所七十七个自新人当中，有十二个贫农，二十三个中农（里面有个恶霸），十二个富农，三十一个地主。算起来，贫农中农成份占百分之四十五。这还是看守所经过查阶级以后的情形。朝远处看看，问题就更多些。去年十月下十天，贫农自新人是二十八个，中农二十七个，富农十三个，地主二十六个，一满九十四个，贫农中农成份占了百分之五十八还多。他们犯的啥罪呢？高所长根据口供说：贫农徐更的（女），南丛井村人。民国三十二年，闹灾荒，家里时光没法过。丈夫曹国的，一声没吭，离开家远走高飞。开头村上有人在南阳邑见过他，后来就一直没有音信。民国三十四年，曹宝贵告了徐更的一状，说她害死丈夫。曹宝贵是地主，又是特务，还当着民兵，是徐更的的小叔。早先，当给过徐更的家八亩地。减租清债的时候，他要抽地，徐更的不让抽。这就种下了大仇。政府开头没有弄清这些事情，把徐更的扣了六、七个月。后来，事情总算是弄明白了，才把徐更的放了回去。徐更的回到家里，吃没吃，烧没烧。政治主任裴成才就趁空找她睡觉，她不愿意。政治主任又给她票子，她也顶回去了，还骂了政治主任一句。从这里，政治主任恨透了她。去年六月，不知道哪里来的风，干部们要翻“旧案”，硬说曹国的是徐更的害死的。把徐更的连吊了七回，打得浑身黑烂青，还要拿烙铁烫她，逼着她“坦白”。徐更的受不住这些刑罚，屈打承招，连她相好的赵玉也“咬”出来，说曹国的是她俩谋害的。干部们就给定了“通奸杀人”的罪名，把徐更的的家产一遭没收，二次把她俩送到看守所。赵玉也是贫农，从小家里啥也没有。八九岁就靠给邻家做小活吃饭。后来跟别人到外面补锅，一直干了十二年。又到自行车铺修车子。过了七八年，又借了房子，租了四五亩地，回家务农。一直没有娶起老婆。他和徐更的相好已经十一年。头一回蹲看守所，也是曹宝贵告的。因为曹宝贵认为徐更的不让抽地，是赵玉在里面捣的鬼。一心要整他，又找不到他的错处，就到区干部那里，说曹国的是赵玉和徐更的俩人害死的。（去年六月，村上查出曹宝贵是特务，他也坦白了这一点，说赵玉害死人“不实际，男人是走了”。）区干部问了赵玉一阵子，就去刨尸。刨了一早晨，没有啥。晚上又去刨。这时，徐更的说先搜搜曹宝贵的身上，曹宝贵不叫搜。结果刨出两根骨头，群众没吭气。后来区干部李玉民说：“骨头弄错啦，不是人骨头。”那时，赵玉早送到看守所了，蹲了两月，后来因为害病，才保出来。回村以后，没敢和徐更的发生关系。去年六月，徐更的的案子“翻”了。一个区工作员问赵玉害死人的事，赵玉说确实没有害死人。就叫他脱了衣服捆起来，旁边放上烙铁，叫他“坦白”。他害了怕，不能不“招承”。这样，又把他送进看守所。另一个有冤枉的自新人，叫张立祯，老家是龙雾村，今年二十五岁。他父亲要过饭，当过长工，后来才到仙岭村租种山坡地，安了家。张立祯十二岁就给人家打短工。十八岁上父亲死去，母亲改嫁。从这以后，人没人，家没家，生活没法。二十岁，因为刻砚瓦做假票子，没做成，村上报告了他，在三专署罚了三个月的徒刑。回村以后，参加部队。不久，开了小差。在家没法过，偷了李东方二斗玉茭，叫人查出来，罚了一条被子。二十一岁，他在村上实在过不下去了，下了关东，在奉天铁矿做工。以后到锅工厂做锅、卖锅。后来又到卷烟公司当工人。以后又在街上当小工。前年五月，从上海、南京、徐州转了一圈，朝家走。路过彰德，叫汉奸李英的部队查住，扣了五天，编到孙殿英的部队里。九月里开到辉县，他开了小差。流落在汤阴屯庄受苦，给人家挑水喂牲口。去年五月，又到崔家田的铺子里给人家卷烟，干了三个月，这村解放，因为他是外路人，就送到武安看守所。象这些受了一辈子罪的人，倒底犯了什么法？司法科问了一大堆口供，就没有根据这些口供，给他们作主，很快把他们的案子弄清楚，开销他们，还一直把他们开在看守所里，不让他们过民主自由的时光。有些自新人，案子已经弄得清清白白，司法科也说要放走他们，象城关的贫民刘田民。可是因为他家里没地没房，连个碗筷子也没有，他就不愿意回家，情愿蹲在看守所里，这真是万般无奈的作法。司法科也没有向地方上提意见，解决他的困难。这些对人民没有好好负起责任来的情形，值得好好检讨。这里应该说明，随着土地改革运动的深入，看守所的工作同志，也是在努力摸索着走阶级路线的，并且已经收到成绩。比方，由于划阶级，改善了贫农、中农自新人的生活，打击了地主自新人的破坏活动。可是因为阶级观念不明确，没有首先看一看是不是冤枉了群众，并很快解决这些冤枉案子，结果到现在还有这么多群众关在看守所里，过着不自由的日子，这应该引起我们最大的注意，彻底检查和改进司法工作。
