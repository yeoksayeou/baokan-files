　　Yuncheng Battle Communication
  　Battle for the City Wall
    The troops had just ascended the north city wall of Yuncheng when the enemy immediately counterattacked. Many enemy cannons fired at the breach (the opening in the city wall we had broken), with seven or eight shells exploding simultaneously. Heavy and light machine guns also fired at the same spot, bullets raining down like hail. The breach was shrouded in smoke and fire, making it impossible to see. The enemy desperately tried to block the opening, preventing the People's Liberation Army from entering the city. However, the heroic assault队员were not afraid of this. No matter how intense the firepower, they only advanced and never retreated. Zhao Chengjin was shot in three fingers at the assault point, but he still charged forward regardless. He fired at the enemy without even lying down. After firing just one bullet, the magazine stopped working. Anxious, he realized it had been damaged by the enemy. He quickly replaced the magazine and continued firing with his bloody hands. Under the powerful bombardment of our artillery, the dozen or so enemies standing on the city wall quickly retreated into the smoke and fire. An enemy explosive charge landed in front of Bai Mingsheng. The fuse hissed and sparked. He quickly grabbed the tail of the charge and threw it down at the enemy below, where it landed on the back of an enemy soldier and immediately ignited. The other enemies were frightened and ran away. Then, the enemy charged again. In a very dangerous situation, Yuan Mingting and Che Mengqing stood at the front, firing at the enemy. Soon, they were both wounded, but they continued to throw grenades. Che Mengqing said in a firm voice: "Comrades! I've been hit, but don't be afraid. Resolutely complete the mission. Insisting for ten more minutes to cover the advance of the troops is our victory." This was his second time being wounded. The few remaining comrades looked at each other in the tense situation and said in unison: "We are determined!" Before they could finish speaking, more than a dozen enemies rushed up with hand grenades. Our assault队员's machine guns fired incessantly. Jin Deyou, while holding a hand grenade, said to everyone: "Rather advance an inch than retreat an inch!" He had just thrown his third hand grenade when a bullet knocked him down. At this moment, no one looked at anyone else, but bravely and calmly threw grenades again. The enemy's several counterattacks on the west side of the north city wall were repelled in this way. The brother troops advancing to the east side of the north city wall simultaneously charged and assaulted the enemy. As soon as the 队员reached the top of the city wall, more than twenty enemies rushed towards them. Mao Deli dispersed them with a barrage of hand grenades, and Wang Zhaowa bravely pursued them, capturing two enemies alive. At this time, the enemy was shooting from inside the bunkers. The assault队员 advanced bravely under the rain of bullets and destroyed two city wall bunkers in a row. The enemy in the third bunker was still resisting stubbornly, so the assault队员 threw in nine bombs, destroying the enemy and the bunker together. Che Fuzhong's face was injured, but he did not leave the front line. He and Zhang Fuliang and three others stood at the front. At this time, six or seven enemies charged over. At the platoon leader's command, a volley of hand grenades was thrown. Che Fuzhong ran out into the smoke and seized an enemy rifle. The enemy retreated, rolling and crawling.
    Before long, the enemy counterattacked again. From afar, they saw one enemy in the lead, running over menacingly with a shiny saber in his hand. Our assault队员 quietly lay prone on the fortifications, tightly gripping their hand grenades. Before the enemy could get close, they unleashed a barrage of hand grenades, disrupting the enemy's formation. Only the foremost enemy charged forward regardless of his life, raising his saber to slash at Che Fuzhong. A soldier jumped out and snatched the enemy's saber, slashing back at the enemy, wounding his arm and capturing him. At this point, the enemy's ferocity was gone. Although there were three consecutive counterattacks, they were repelled time and time again by our heroic assault队员. Our troops then successively entered the city.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Ke Ren)

　　运城战斗通讯
  　城头争夺战
    部队刚刚上了运城的北城楼，敌人马上就反冲过来。敌人很多炮一齐向这个突破口（城墙上被我们打破的口子）打来，同时就有七八颗炮弹爆炸，轻重机枪也一齐向这里打来，子弹就象下雹雨一般。突破口被烟火罩得人也看不见了。敌人想拼命的把这个口子堵住，不让人民解放军进城。可是英勇的突击队员，是不怕这些的，就有再大的火力，他们也是只有前进，没有后退。赵成金在冲锋口上就被一颗子弹打伤了三个指头，他还是不顾一切冲上去，来不及卧倒就向敌人射击，刚打了一颗子弹，转盘就不动了，急得他没有办法，一看才知道是被敌人打坏了，他赶紧换了一个转盘，用血淋淋的手射击起来。在我们的强大炮火打击下，站在城上的十几个敌人，往烟火里赶紧退回去。敌人的一个炸药包扔在白明生的面前，导火绳燃的嗤嗤嗤的响，他急忙抓起弹尾扔给城下的敌人，正好落在一个敌人的背上，马上燃烧起来，其余的敌人都吓得跑了。接着敌人又冲过来了，在很危险的情况下，原明廷、车梦清始终站在前面，向敌人开火，不大一会他们都受了伤，还是不断的投手榴弹。车梦清用刚强的口音说：同志们！我挂了彩，大家不要害怕，坚决完成任务，多坚持十分钟，掩护部队前进就是我们的胜利。他自己是第二次负伤了，仅有的几个同志在紧张的情况下，互相看了一眼，齐声说：“我们有决心”，话还没有说完，十几个敌人提着手榴弹又上来了，我突击队员们的机枪哒哒哒地不停的打起来。靳得有一面提着手榴弹、一面向大家说：“宁前进一尺，也不后退一寸”，他把第三颗手榴弹刚打出去，一颗子弹就把他打倒了，这时候谁也没有看谁，就又勇敢沉着的投掷手榴弹了。北城头西面敌人的几次反扑，就这样的被打下去了。向北城墙上的东面发展的兄弟部队，同时向敌人冲锋突击，队员们刚上了城头，二十几个敌人就迎面扑来，被毛德礼一阵手榴弹打溃的时候，王赵娃勇猛追上去，活捉了两个敌人。这时敌人钻在地堡里射击，突击队员们冒着弹雨奋勇前进，一连解决了两个城头碉堡，第三个碉堡的敌人还在顽抗，突击队员们就扔进九颗炸弹，敌人和碉堡便一同消灭了。车福忠的脸被打伤了，他也不下火线，还是和张福亮们四人站在最前面坚持，这时六七个敌人冲来，排长一声口令，一个排子手榴弹打出来，车福忠在烟雾里跑出去夺了敌人一支步枪，敌人就连滚带爬的退下去了。
    不大一会，敌人就又反攻上来，远远的看见最前面的一个敌人，手里拿着雪亮的砍刀，气势凶凶的跑过来，我们的突击队员们静悄悄的爬在工事上，紧紧的握着手榴弹，未等敌人接近，就打出一阵手榴弹，把敌人的阵势打乱，只有最前边的一个敌人不顾死活的冲过来，举起大刀向车福忠砍去，一个战士一下子跳出来，把敌人的刀子夺掉反向敌人砍去，砍伤他的胳膊，把他捉住，这时敌人的凶劲已经没有了，虽然连续来了三次反扑，都被我们的英勇突击队员一次一次的打退，我们的部队就陆续开入城内。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（克仁）
