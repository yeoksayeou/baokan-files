　　Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan, 8th: In the battles where the Liberation Army captured Dongming and Kaocheng, and fiercely attacked the defending enemies in the suburbs of Heze, over 10,000 enemy troops were annihilated in three days. The offensive began on the night of December 28th. That evening, Kaocheng was captured, and strongholds such as Wanghaotun and Machang on the Heze-Kaocheng highway were eliminated. The defending enemy, the artillery battalion of the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division (previously mistakenly reported as the logistics battalion), the First Battalion of the 543rd Regiment of the 55th Division, the puppet Kaocheng County Government Security Team, and other puppet miscellaneous troops, totaling 3,000 men, were completely annihilated. At 3:00 PM on the 30th, the general attack on Dongming City commenced, and the battle concluded in just one hour. The Chiang bandit Hebei Provincial 14th Commissioner's Office and the Special Service Battalion and Security Regiment of the Commissioner's District Security Headquarters, six puppet county governments of Dongming, Puyang, Nanle, Daming, Qingfeng, and Guangping, as well as the "returning home corps" landlords and local bullies, were all captured in one fell swoop. Over 7,000 Chiang bandit troops, including Ding Shuben, the Commissioner of the 14th District of Hebei Province and Lieutenant General Security Commander, were captured. Chiang bandit troops entrenched in Damazhuang, Jizhuang, Yuelou, and Chenhai areas in the suburbs of Heze, as well as the county brigades of Juancheng and Dingtao counties, and the "returning home corps" of the Heze Third District Office, totaling over 1,000 men, collapsed at the first touch during our mopping-up operation on the night of the 28th. The Liberation Army captured over 500 enemies in 20 minutes, and the rest were captured alive one by one by the local county and district teams and militia. That night, the Liberation Army took advantage of the victory and attacked into the four gates of Heze City, capturing a part of the 541st Regiment of the enemy, and liberating over 1,000 conscripted soldiers. They then launched a fierce artillery bombardment on the enemy in the city, inflicting heavy casualties. At this point, Heze was completely isolated.
