　　Local Armed Forces in Northern Henan Launch Full-Scale Offensive
  　Annihilate Over 400 Enemy Troops in Seven Days
    Advance into Enemy Rear Areas of Xiuwu and Huojia, Capturing Over Ten Strongholds

    [News from Northern Henan] Local armed forces of the Fourth Military Subdistrict of the Taihang Region have launched a full-scale guerrilla offensive against the enemy, proactively attacking the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops entrenched in strongholds such as Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, and Huojia. On December 18th, our unit once again entered the villages of Dongfengfeng and Xifengfeng, west of Jiaozuo. The Chiang bandits fled without daring to resist, and we promptly destroyed all the enemy fortifications and pillboxes in Dongfengfeng Village. On the 20th, our Pinghan Detachment advanced into the enemy's rear, penetrating the Xiu(wu)-Huo(jia)-Wu(zhi) triangle area three times. We successively recovered more than ten strongholds, large and small, including Xieqiying, Xuying, Xuanyangyi, and Sungang. We also completely destroyed the Pinghan Railway section from ZhanDian to Zhongyi, north of Xinxiang, killing or wounding five enemy soldiers, capturing 109, seizing two machine guns, one 60mm mortar, more than 100 rifles, seven war horses, seven bicycles, and one telephone. The Chiang bandits entrenched in Huojia, Wuzhi, and the Yellow River Railway Bridge were terrified and had to ask the Chiang bandits entrenched in Jiaozuo and Xinxiang for help. On the same day, our Eastward Advance Detachment attacked the enemy stronghold in Yuba Village, southeast of Wuzhi on the bank of the Yellow River. The stationed enemy fled, and the puppet self-defense captain was captured. On the 21st, the militia rotation teams of the 3rd and 4th districts of Xiuwu ambushed the Chiang bandit transport team of the Zhengzhou Command, stationed in Xinxiang, at the Lihe Railway Station, ten miles east of Jiaozuo. Except for one enemy platoon leader who escaped, we captured more than 30 people, seized 39 mules, and suffered no casualties. On the evening of the 22nd, our unit raided Encun Village, five miles south of Jiaozuo, capturing one enemy soldier. On the 23rd, the unit launched a surprise attack on the south gate of Jiaozuo, capturing six Chiang puppet self-defense members and seizing six rifles. On the 24th, Wang Delin, the puppet bandit leader of Beizhu Village, personally led more than 1,000 bandit troops to attack our Xiaoliangzhuang (southwest of Jiaozuo), but was repelled by our Qinbo Column. More than 50 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, four were captured, and five rifles were seized. On the same day, two battalions of the Chiang bandit's 38th Division, combined with local puppet bandits, attacked Zhaowangxiang Village in our Xiu-Huo-Wu area. They were met with a head-on blow from our Pinghan Detachment, which killed or wounded more than 200 regular Chiang bandit soldiers, captured one enemy company commander, four platoon leaders, and five soldiers. On the evening of the 25th, a part of our Boqin Column captured ten puppet self-defense soldiers outside the south gate of Jiaozuo, seizing seven rifles, 438 rounds of ammunition, and liberating more than 20 conscripted laborers.
