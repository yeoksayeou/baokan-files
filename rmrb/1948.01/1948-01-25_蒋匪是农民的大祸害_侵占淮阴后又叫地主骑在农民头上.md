Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. A dispatch from Central Jiangsu: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is actively restoring the feudal system of exploitation in Huaiyin County, its occupied area in Central Jiangsu. More than 200,000 peasants in the county are once again subjected to the cruel exploitation of more than 1,600 feudal landlords in the county. Chen, the Chiang bandit magistrate of Huaiyin County who is carrying out this reactionary measure, was appointed by Chiang Kai-shek with a personal "edict." After the bandit Chen "took office" last spring, he immediately colluded with local despots and evil gentry to organize a so-called "Land Rights Mediation Committee," and seized more than 480,000 mu of land that the peasants had obtained during the land reform carried out by the democratic government. He also ordered the peasants to register their "lease contracts" and forced them to pay rent to the landlords. A large number of peasants lost their land again and lived by working as farmhands. The Chiang bandits also stipulated that hired laborers must not "absent themselves from work without reason," and those who violate this regulation will have their wages deducted on a daily basis. The "China Farmers Bank" and "Cooperative Treasury" of the bandit chief Chen Lifu also took the opportunity to invade the rural areas of Huaiyin, colluding with the Chiang bandit county government of the county to set up so-called "cooperative farms," forcing self-cultivating farmers to invest their land and property as shares, and issuing the shareholding peasants a "land certificate," which in effect nullified the peasants' land ownership.

　　蒋匪是农民的大祸害
    侵占淮阴后又叫地主骑在农民头上
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】苏中通讯：蒋介石匪帮近在其苏中侵占区淮阴县积极恢复封建剥削制度，该县二十多万农民又重新被放在该县一千六百多户封建地主的残酷剥削下。执行此项反动措施的蒋匪淮阴县长陈某，系蒋介石亲下“手谕”委派者。陈匪于去春“到任”后，即纠合当地土豪劣绅组织所谓“地权调处委员会”，到处夺取民主政府进行土地改革时期农民取得的土地共四十八万余亩，并勒令农民办理“租约登记”，强迫农民向地主交纳地租。大批农民又失掉土地，而以帮工为生。蒋匪复规定：雇农不得“无故旷工”，违者按日扣除工资。匪首陈立夫的“中国农民银行”和“合作金库”也乘机侵入淮阴农村，与该县蒋匪县政府勾结，举办所谓“合作农场”，逼着自耕农将土地和财产入股，发给入股农民一纸“土地证券”，实际上是将农民土地所有权化为乌有。
