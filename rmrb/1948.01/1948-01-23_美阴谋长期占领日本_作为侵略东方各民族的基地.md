　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 21st: Shanghai report: In November of last year, MacArthur's headquarters and Japanese government officials successively announced a "startling news," saying that there was a "secret government" in Japan, and that the American occupation forces and their so-called "Japan reform plan" were being "severely threatened" by this so-called "secret government's" "extensive underground movement." MacArthur's real intention in this trick is to deliberately create a chaotic situation and a tense atmosphere, in order to prove that the American imperialists must occupy Japan indefinitely. This point has now been exposed by commentators in Shanghai. According to the news of the so-called Japanese "secret government," it was officially reported by MacArthur's headquarters in November last year. Colonel Cardo, deputy chief of the American military government, declared in a statement: The current basic political struggle is being carried out "between the supremacy of law and the secret rule of bandits. The latter is using figures from various camps such as former diplomats, members of parliament, and industrialists." At the same time, confidants of Japanese Prime Minister Katayama explained that these underground lurking elements were former army and navy officers. They were unwilling to accept defeat, so they organized an underground government. A Japanese government spokesman explained this fact as "a natural product of the failure to restore economic stability after the war." In order to resist this situation, "some Japanese leaders even advocated that the American occupation forces should not withdraw even after the peace treaty is signed." Commentators in Shanghai believe that this remark by the Japanese spokesman, who was described by Reuters' Tokyo correspondent at the time as "closest to Prime Minister Katayama," has completely revealed the conspiracy of the reactionaries of the United States and Japan. The person pointed out: The entire conspiracy of the American imperialists is to occupy Japan for a long time as a base for aggression against the eastern nations. This conspiracy is not only manifested in the propaganda of the so-called "Japanese secret government," but also in MacArthur's entire policy of deliberately creating a domestic political and economic crisis in Japan, and the Japanese army and navy officers, former diplomats, members of parliament, industrialists, etc., who are related to the "secret government" and accused of being used by bandits, are not being used by any other bandits, but are being used by MacArthur, the number one bandit. It is no longer a secret that MacArthur not only indulges but also actively uses this group of war criminals to play the puppet show of mutual infighting with his other group of lackeys such as Katayama, so that the United States can delay the occupation period as much as possible in the chaos.
　　The person further pointed out: MacArthur's strategy is consistent with the rumors that MacArthur suggested to Marshall. MacArthur suggested that the time for the occupation of Japan must be extended, and for this purpose, the signing of a peace treaty with Japan must be delayed under various pretexts. MacArthur believes that the United States must maintain American naval and air bases in Japan, China, and Korea, and even after the signing of a peace treaty with Japan, the United States should still retain its military power in order to completely consolidate the United States' position in the Far East. MacArthur also believes that in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to continue to deepen the deterioration of the political and economic situation in Japan and strengthen the propaganda of the tense situation in Japan, so that public opinion feels that the long-term occupation of Japan by the United States is forced and justified. Commentators in Shanghai especially reminded the Chinese people to pay attention to MacArthur's conspiracy, which is now actively unfolding, and the unreasonable actions of the US government regarding the peace conference with Japan, deliberately using the cancellation of the four-power veto and convening the so-called eleven-nation conference to replace the four-nation conference, making the peace conference with Japan impossible to start, are completely in line with this conspiracy. The US policy of delaying the peace treaty with Japan obviously serves the same purpose as its policy of occupying Japan, that is, to occupy Japan indefinitely to invade the eastern nations.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 19th: Comprehensive reports from various sources: The US imperialists' ambition to vigorously promote the growth of Japanese aggressive forces is even more rampant. The Far East Economic Group, under MacArthur's control, decided on the 7th that after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, Japan could produce 5.5 million tons of steel annually (Note: equivalent to the level of steel production in 1933-1935 before the Japanese bandits launched the "July 7th Incident"). On the 10th, MacArthur's headquarters approved the Los Angeles Yallars Import and Export Company and the Japan Foreign Trade Bureau to sign a trade contract worth 7 million US dollars for steel and coal. The contract stipulates that Japan will exchange 20,000 tons of steel plates and 5,000 tons of waste electrical steel plates for 320,000 tons of American coking coal, and the first batch of 8,500 tons of coal shipped from the United States to Japan arrived in Japan on the same day. It is generally believed that this is a signal for Japan to rebuild large-scale world trade. At the same time, American banks such as "Citibank," "American," and "Import and Export" are conducting new loan negotiations with Japanese businessmen. In order to facilitate Japanese financial groups to conduct comprador-like transactions directly and openly with US monopoly capital, the Katayama cabinet's Standing Committee recently decided that banks affiliated with Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda can be exempted from the "Economic Decentralization Act"; Nakajima Kumakichi, chairman of the Japan Foreign Trade Association, even advocated that the Japanese economy "merge into the US economic system." Under the policy of "close cooperation" between Japanese financial groups and American gold dollars, Japan's economic aggression against foreign countries (especially the Chiang-controlled area) will become even more rampant. "Asahi Shimbun" revealed on the 5th that Katayama, in his "Five-Year Economic Stabilization Plan," expects Japan's total exports this year to be 519 million US dollars (last year Japan's total exports were 491 million US dollars, and the main export product was cotton textiles), and imports will reach 781 million US dollars. By 1952, exports will increase sharply to 1.395 billion US dollars, and imports will increase to 1.494 billion US dollars. And the United States is the biggest profit sucker in this trade. The New York Herald Tribune commented on the US imperialists' strengthening of control over the Japanese economy and openly confessed, "Japan has now actually become a protectorate of the United States."

　　美阴谋长期占领日本
  　作为侵略东方各民族的基地
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】上海讯：去年十一月间麦克阿瑟总部与日本政府官员曾先后宣布一项“惊人消息”，说日本存在着一个“秘密政府”，而美国占领军及其所谓“对日改革方案”则正受着这个所谓“秘密政府”的“广泛地下运动”的“严重威胁”。麦克阿瑟这个把戏的真实企图乃是故意制造混乱的形势与紧张的空气，借以证明美国帝国主义者必须无限期地占领日本。此点现已为上海评论界人士所揭破。按所谓日本“秘密政府”的消息，系于去年十一月由麦克阿瑟总部正式报导。美国军政府副长官卡道上校于声明中宣称：目前的基本政治斗争是进行在“法律至上与匪徒的秘密统治之间。后者正利用过去的外交官、议会议员及工业家等各阵营人物”。同时，日本首相片山的亲信们则解释称：这些地下潜伏分子，乃是过去的陆海军官。他们不愿接受战败，所以组织地下政府。日本政府发言人解释这个事实是“战争之后未恢复经济稳定前所有的自然产物”。为了抵抗这个情势，“若干日本领袖甚至主张签订和约后美国占领军也不能撤退”。上海评论界人士认为此一被路透社驻东京记者当时描写为“最为片山首相接近的”日本发言人的谈话，实已将美日两国反动派的阴谋和盘托出。该人士指出：美国帝国主义者的全部阴谋就是长期占领日本作为侵略东方各民族的基地。这个阴谋不仅表现于所谓“日本秘密政府”的宣传，并且表现于麦克阿瑟故意制造日本国内政治经济危机的全部政策，而所谓与“秘密政府”有关并被控为受匪徒利用的日本陆海军官、前外交官、议会议员、工业家等，并不是被任何旁的匪徒所利用，恰恰就是被麦克阿瑟这个头号匪徒所利用。麦克阿瑟不但放纵并且积极利用这批战犯，使他们与他的另一批走狗片山等人扮演互相混战的傀儡戏，以便美国在混乱之中尽量拖延占领期，这早已不是秘密了。
    该人士进一步指出：麦克阿瑟的这个策略与外传麦氏向马歇尔的建议是相符合的。麦氏建议必须延长占领日本的时间，为此并须在各种借口下拖延签订对日和约。麦氏认为美国在日本、中国和朝鲜必须保有美国海空军基地，甚至即在签订对日和约以后，仍应保留美国的军事力量，这样才能完全巩固美国在远东的地位。麦氏又认为，为达到此项目的就必须继续加深日本政治、经济情况的恶化，并加强宣传日本的紧张形势，使舆论觉得美国长期占领日本是被迫的和正当的。上海评论界人士特别提醒中国人民注意麦克阿瑟的这一阴谋现在积极展开，而美国政府关于对日和会故意借取消四强否决权与召开所谓十一国会议以代替四国会议的无理取闹行动，使对日和会无从开起，正与这一阴谋完全合拍。美国关于拖延对日和会的政策，显然与其占领日本的政策服务于同一目的，即无限期占领日本以侵略东方各民族。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】综合各方讯：美帝国主义力促日本侵略势力成长之野心，更形猖獗。在麦克阿瑟一手控制下的远东经济小组于七日决定，待对日和约签订后，日本每年可产钢五百五十万吨（按：相当于一九三三——三五年日寇发动“七七事变”前夕之产钢水平）。十日麦克阿瑟总部即批准洛杉矶雅拉斯进出口公司与日本对外贸易局签订价值七百万美元之钢铁与煤的贸易合同。该合同规定：日本以二万吨钢板和五千吨废电钢板，交换三十二万吨美国焦煤，美国输日首批八千五百吨煤已于同日运抵日本。一般认为这是日本重建大规模世界贸易之信号。与此同时，美国“花旗”、“美利坚”、“进出口”等银行又与日商进行新的贷款谈判。为便于日本财阀能与美独占资本直接和公开地进行买办性交易计，片山内阁常委会于最近决定，三井、三菱、住友、安田所属银行，可不受“经济分散法案”之约束；日本对外贸易协会主席中岛久马吉甚至主张日本经济“并入美国经济体系中”，在日本财阀与美国金元“密切合作”政策下，日本对外（特别是对蒋管区）之经济侵略将更形嚣张。“朝日新闻”五日透露：片山于其“五年经济稳定计划”中，预料本年度日本输出总额为五亿一千九百万美元（按去年日本输出总额为四亿九千一百万美元，输出品主要系棉织物），输入将达七亿八千一百万美元，至一九五二年输出将急增至十三亿九千五百万美元，输入增至十四亿九千四百万美元。而此项贸易美国乃最大之利润吸吮者。纽约先驱论坛报评美帝加强控制日本经济时，公开自供称：“日本现在实际上已成为美国的保卫国”。
