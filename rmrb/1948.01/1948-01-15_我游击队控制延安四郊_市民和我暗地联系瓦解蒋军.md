Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th -- The Yan'an suburban guerrilla forces have shattered Hu bandit's repeated cruel "village consolidation" and "creation of uninhabited villages" "encirclement and suppression", and have regained control of the four suburban areas of Yan'an. After the "Letter to the Elders of Yan'an" written by Yao Anji, the mayor of our democratic government, was smuggled into the city, citizens secretly spread it, saying, "Our guerrillas are back!" Once, the masses in a certain village carried soft rice cakes through the enemy's tight blockade and delivered them to the guerrillas. The guerrillas also received cotton-padded clothes, shoes, socks, and cloth brought from the city, as well as more than seven hundred bullets. Children in the city collected bullets and sent them to the guerrillas. A citizen in the suburbs was forced by Hu bandit to carry bullets, and escaped on the way and gave the bullets to the guerrillas. Citizens cleverly explained the People's Liberation Army's policy on prisoners to the Chiang Hu soldiers. When Xue, a pseudo-Shaanxi Northern Administrative Office official, tried to escape, an old woman told him, "If you run twenty miles along the Shun River, you will reach the Red area." Many Chiang Hu soldiers escaped the tiger's mouth under the guidance of the people.

　　我游击队控制延安四郊
  　市民和我暗地联系瓦解蒋军
    【新华社西北十三日电】延安市郊游击队粉碎了胡匪屡次“并村”、“制造无人村”的残酷“清剿”，重新控制延市四郊。当我民主政府市长姚安吉写的“给延安父老的一封信”传入市区后，市民秘密传播，他们说：“咱们的游击队回来啦！”某村群众有一次抬了软米糕通过敌人严密的封锁，送到游击队里。游击队并收到由市里捎来的棉衣、鞋袜、布匹，还有七百多发子弹。市内孩子们纷纷收集子弹送去，城郊某市民被胡匪拉去挑子弹，途中逃出把子弹送给游击队。市民机警的给蒋胡士兵，解释解放军的俘虏政策。伪陕北行署薛某想逃跑，一个老太太就告诉他“顺川跑出二十里就是红区”。许多蒋胡士兵在老百姓指引下逃出虎口。
