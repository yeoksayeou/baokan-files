Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: New York dispatch: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Representative to the United Nations, Gromyko, recently delivered a speech at a banquet for over a thousand American Jewish leaders, strongly urging the swift implementation of the United Nations' decision to partition Palestine. Gromyko condemned "certain elements" who are doing their utmost to obstruct the implementation of the partition, causing continuous conflicts and casualties between Arabs and Jews for over a month. Gromyko pointed out: "The Soviet Union cannot agree with the argument that the so-called partition plan is used to oppose the Arabs. The Soviet Union firmly believes that this decision is in line with the vital interests of both the Arab and Jewish peoples. The basic principle of the Soviet Union's national policy is national equality and self-determination." Gromyko stressed: "The UN General Assembly's decision to divide Palestine into two independent states will end the bankrupt mandate rule, which is of great historical significance." Gromyko finally pointed out: "It is rumored that the British authorities are trying to prevent the United Nations Palestine Commission from entering Palestine before the British troops withdraw." He called on Britain to cooperate with the Commission not only in words but also in deeds to solve this problem. Since the UN passed the partition plan on November 29th last year, British and American imperialism have been creating chaos, attempting to delay the implementation of this plan in order to continue their rule in Palestine. They have used the British intelligence chief Clayton to instigate their lackeys among the ruling classes of Arab countries (such as the notorious King Abdullah of Transjordan, the Grand Mufti Husseini, etc.) to oppose the partition plan by exploiting the extreme national sentiments of the Arabs, using the crazy and hypocritical slogans of "Down with America, down with Britain, down with the Soviet Union, down with the United Nations" as a guise, but in fact, they are plotting to strangle the progressive forces that truly represent the Arab people. For example, the pro-fascist organization "Muslim Brotherhood" in Syria burned down the headquarters of the Syrian Communist Party under the pretext of anti-partition demonstrations, and the Syrian government also announced the dissolution of the Syrian Communist Party under various pretexts. In addition, similar persecutions of communists have occurred in Lebanon. At the same time, the Arab League also advocated the formation of a large Arab army to unify Palestine by force, making the Middle East present a strong atmosphere of war for a time. For more than a month, unfortunate conflicts have continued to occur between Arab and Jewish residents in Jerusalem, Jaffa, and other places, resulting in hundreds of casualties. Recent news shows that the Arab people have gradually awakened through long-term bloodshed experience. For example, when several British police officers instigated villagers in the Arab Alahu-ber district to attack the Jews in neighboring villages, they were angrily driven away by the Arabs in the village.

　　揭穿美英挑拨阴谋
  　主张分治巴勒斯坦
  　葛罗米柯发表演说
    【新华社陕北十八日电】纽约讯：苏联外次兼驻联合国代表葛罗米柯，近在千余美籍犹太领袖之宴会上发表演说，力促尽速实现联合国分治巴勒斯坦之决定。葛氏谴责“某种分子”正竭力进行阻挠实行分治之活动，致引起阿拉伯人与犹太人间月余以来不断的冲突和死伤。葛氏指出：“对于所谓分治计划乃用以反对阿拉伯人之言论，苏联不能同意。苏联坚信此一决定实与阿、犹两民族之切身利益相符。苏联民族政策之基本原则，即为民族平等与自决”。葛氏力称：“联大划分巴勒斯坦为两个独立国之决定，将结束业已破产之委任统治，这具有重大的历史意义。”葛氏最后指出：“传闻英国当局企图阻止联合国巴勒斯坦委员会在英军撤退以前进入巴勒斯坦”，他呼吁英国不仅在口头上，且在实际上与该委员会合作，以解决此一问题。按自联大于去年十一月二十九日通过分治计划后，英美帝国主义即制造纷乱，企图延缓此项计划之实行，以便继续其在巴勒斯坦之统治。它们曾通过英国特务头子克莱顿将军唆使其在阿拉伯诸国统治阶级中之走狗（如臭名昭著之外约但王阿布杜拉、回教主胡赛尼等），利用阿拉伯人偏激之民族感情，反对分治计划，以“打倒美国，打倒英国，打倒苏联，打倒联合国”之疯狂虚伪口号为幌子，实则阴谋扼杀真正代表阿拉伯人民之进步力量。例如叙利亚亲法西斯组织“回教兄弟会”即借反分治游行焚毁叙共总部，叙政府亦以各种借口宣布解散叙共。此外在黎巴嫩亦有类似之迫害共产党事件。同时阿拉伯联盟并倡议筹组阿拉伯大军，以武力统一巴勒斯坦，使中东一时呈现浓厚之战争气氛。月余以来，在耶路撒冷、雅法诸地，阿、犹居民间曾不断发生不幸之冲突，死伤已达数百人。最近消息，阿拉伯人民在长期流血经验中，已逐渐觉悟，如最近若干英国警察在煽动阿拉伯阿拉虎伯区村民攻击邻村之犹太人时，即遭该村阿人愤怒驱逐。
