Taihang Winter Production Material Proves
　　Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Line Was Not Well Implemented
    Mainly Due to Leaders Satisfied with the Old Formalistic Approach
    [Our Newspaper News] This year's winter production in Taihang lasted for nearly three months. The slogan raised in various places was "Facing the Poor and Hired Peasants," following the "Poor and Hired Peasant Line." Now, many places have proven that this poor and hired peasant line is fake. There are mainly three situations:

    The first situation is that the leadership and the cooperative that organizes winter production are controlled by landlords and rich peasants. This is the first stumbling block. In Nanhui Mountain, Lincheng, 240,000 yuan was loaned out, and five households that had been struggled against received 100,000 yuan. In Yitou Village, Lingchuan, ten out of sixteen people in the cooperative were landlords, completely controlled by landlords, directly exploiting the masses. The Su Village cooperative in Pingding used most of its funds to purchase fifty-two spinning wheels, but only eleven were given to the fifty-eight poor and hired peasant households, failing to prioritize meeting the needs of poor and hired peasants. The rest were distributed to middle peasants and above, with seven going to landlords and two to rich peasants. During the inspection of Dongguan, Xiyang, the poor and hired peasants summarized this situation: "People who are eloquent and capable get things done, resulting in leading some tails (referring to landlords). Leading the poor and hired peasants is also considered difficult." This shows that we did not have a clear class viewpoint in the past in winter production, and as a result, landlords infiltrated.

    The second situation is the resistance of cadres: Some cadres are landlords and rich peasants who have infiltrated; some are middle peasants and cannot fully understand the suffering of the poor and hired peasants; some were originally poor and hired peasants, but after turning over and gaining more fruits, they forgot their roots. Therefore, they resist helping the poor and hired peasants with production. The cadres of Gaodian Village, Tunliu, said, "The leadership told us to follow the poor and hired peasant line. We have been leading the masses to turn over for several years! Isn't it all for the poor? How else should we proceed?" But an inspection revealed that "the poor and hired peasants contribute the most labor," and "in the agricultural association's oil mill, the poor peasants only have three shares." Some local cadres openly satirized the poor and hired peasants, saying, "Even if there is a 'thousand-mile horse,' there must be a 'thousand-mile person'," looking down on the ability of the poor and hired peasants to produce. Li Wusuo, a poor and hired peasant in Anyang Village, Pingshun, fearing that people would say he didn't know how to live, said that he himself was "cultivating one and having a surplus of one." Some even adopted a method of open collapse: "In Cheshangpu Village, Zuoquan, the cooperative director, group leaders, and shop loans were all pushed to the poor and hired peasants, nominally saying that the poor and hired peasants were in charge, but in reality, the cadres were engaged in production separately." "After a poor and hired peasant in Panlong, Wuxiang, became the mutual aid group leader, he had the title but no power. He said: 'When can I take off this Dragon King robe?'" The more "mobilization" there was, the more isolated and helpless the poor and hired peasants became. In Chitou Village, Lucheng, it was not until the inspection of winter production that the village cadres checked door-to-door, discovered twenty-five poor and hired peasant households, and convened a meeting of poor and hired peasants. Finally, it was decided that the political director would take out 5,000 yuan, the cooperative manager would take out 5,000 yuan and ten shi of surplus grain, and the agricultural association director would also take out 5,000 yuan. Following their "influence," thirteen new middle peasants, twenty-three old middle peasants, and eleven wealthy middle peasants, a total of fifty households, actively "donated," contributing a total of 212,000 yuan. They wanted to use "charity" and donating from middle peasants to make up for the poor and hired peasants' deficits. Under these circumstances, the poor and hired peasants had even less opportunity to be in power.

    The third situation is that the leadership is satisfied with the old set of formalistic methods of ideological breakthrough, satisfied with "bestowing" temporary economic benefits on the poor and hired peasants, and satisfied with the formalistic change of components, thus producing various distortions of the poor and hired peasant line. In Zhaidian Village, Lucheng, starting from accounting to "enlighten" the cadres' concept of the poor and hired peasants, they decided to adopt "an inspection of one labor and one animal, rather than an inspection of one door and one household." The final slogan put forward was: "Even if you have a thousand gold, don't forget to make a fraction of a cent every day." This slogan does not represent the poor and hired peasants, but completely represents the wealthy people's point of view. In the summary of winter production in the first district of Pingshun, it was considered that the new middle peasants benefited more than the old middle peasants, which was a success of the poor and hired peasant line. Whether there were still poor and hired peasants who had not turned over besides the new middle peasants, and whether the poor and hired peasants had truly consciously started production were not mentioned. Mobilizing the poor and hired peasants does not mean "bestowing" some benefits to them, but truly letting them consciously participate in the leadership of production organizations. In addition, some places believed that as long as a few poor and hired peasants were placed in the cooperative, the poor and hired peasant line had been followed, and "great achievements" had been obtained, without consciously understanding that the poor and hired peasants are the class we rely on, and formalistic transformation alone is not enough.

    The above three situations prove that the "poor and hired peasant line" in this year's winter production is fake in many places. Recent materials have exposed that the real difficulties of the poor and hired peasants in many areas have not been resolved. We are only satisfied with a set of formalistic methods from top to bottom, such as "poor and hired peasants taking the lead" and "ideological mobilization," without understanding that only when we truly clarify that the poor and hired peasants are the class we rely on, must we resolutely rely on the poor and hired peasants, unite the middle peasants, and completely eliminate the past set of formalistic and substituting practices, can we do a good job in winter production and embark on a truly poor and hired peasant line.

### 太行冬季生产材料证明　贫雇路线没走好  主要是领导上满足旧的形式主义一套

　　太行冬季生产材料证明
  　贫雇路线没走好
    主要是领导上满足旧的形式主义一套
    【本报消息】今年太行各地的冬季生产一共闹了将近三个月，各地方提的口号是“面向雇贫”，走“雇贫路线”，如今有不少地方证明这种雇贫路线是假的，主要有三种情况：
    第一种情况是领导与组织冬季生产的合作社被地主富农掌握了，这就是第一个绊脚石。临城南辉山贷款二十四万元，五个被斗户就贷了十万元。陵川冶头村合作社十六人中，十人是地主，完全被地主统制，直接剥削群众。平定苏村合作社用大部资金割了五十二辆纺花车，但五十八户雇贫只得了十一辆，根本没有首先满足雇贫要求；其他都发给了中农以上成份，有七架给了地主，两架给了富农。昔阳东关检查中雇贫对这种情况做了个总结：“人家能说会道干了做，结果是带领了一些尾巴（指地主），带领雇贫还嫌费力。”这就说明了我们过去在冬季生产上没有明确的阶级观点，结果地主钻进来了。
    第二种情况是干部的抵抗：干部中有的是地主富农混进来的；有的是中农成份，不太能理解雇贫的苦；有的虽然原来就是雇贫，翻了身，多得了果实后便忘了本，因此他们是抵抗扶助雇贫生产的。屯留高店村的干部说：“领导上叫我们走雇贫路线呢，我们领导群众翻身几年啦！还不是为了穷人，还该怎样走？”但一检查才发现“支差是雇贫支的多”，“农会里的油坊，贫农只有三股”。有的地方干部公开讽刺雇贫说：“有千里马，还得有千里人”，看不起雇贫能生产。平顺安阳村雇贫李五锁，因为害怕说他不会过，便说他自己“耕一余一”了。有的更采取了公开垮台的办法：“左权车上铺村把合作社长，小组长，店房贷款等都推给雇贫，名义上说让雇贫掌权，实际上干部又另外搞生产。”“武乡蟠龙某雇贫当了互助小组长后，有职无权，他说：什么时候就脱了这个龙王爷袍了。”这样越“发动”，雇贫越孤立，越没办法。潞城赤头村是直到检查冬季生产，村干部才挨门挨户检查，发现了有二十五户雇贫，召开雇贫会，最后决议政治主任拿五千元，合作社经理拿五千元及余粮十石，农会主任也拿出五千元，接着烈属富裕中农拿出一万元；在他们的“影响”下有十三户新中农，二十三户旧中农，十一户富裕中农，共五十户积极“捐款”，共帮助出二十一万二千元。他们想用“恩赐”与捐中农的办法来补雇贫窟窿，在这种情形下，雇贫就更无从当权了。
    第三种情况是领导上满足于旧的一套形式的打通思想的方法，满足于“恩赐”雇贫一时经济利益，满足于形式上的成份改换，因而便产生了各种各样对雇贫路线的曲解。潞城翟店村，从算帐“启发”干部的雇贫观念，便决定了采取“一劳一畜检查而不是一门一户的检查”。最后提出的口号是：“家有千金不要忘了日进分文。”这种口号不是代表雇贫的，完全代表有钱人的说法。平顺一区在总结冬季生产中认为新中农比旧中农得利多就是雇贫路线有成绩，新中农以外是否还有未翻身雇贫？雇贫是不是真正自觉起来生产均未提到。发动雇贫并不等于“恩赐”给他一些利益，而是真正让他们自觉起来参加生产组织的领导。此外还有的地方认为只要在合作社里按上几个贫雇，便是走了雇贫路线，便“获得很大成绩”，而没有自觉的去了解雇贫是我们要依靠的阶级，仅有形式的改造是不够的。
    以上三种情况，证明今年冬季生产的“雇贫路线”很多地方是假的，最近的材料暴露了不少地区雇贫的真正困难并未解决，我们只是满足了自上而下的一套形式主义办法，什么“雇贫带头”，“思想发动”，不了解只有我们真正明确了雇贫是我们所依靠的阶级，必须坚决依靠雇贫，团结中农，完完全全取消过去一套形式主义与代替包办的作法，才能搞好冬季生产，走上真正的雇贫路线。
