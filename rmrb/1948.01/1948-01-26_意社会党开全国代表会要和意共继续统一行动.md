Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 24th: Rome dispatch: The 26th National Congress of the Italian Socialist Party commenced in Rome on the 20th. Representatives from the Socialist Parties of nine countries, including France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, attended. Several thousand people gathered together. When Italian Socialist Party General Secretary Pietro Nenni delivered his report to the congress, he first announced that the party's membership had exceeded 900,000. He then strongly advocated continuing to abide by the united action treaty between the Italian Communist Party and the Italian Socialist Party in all respects. (Note: This treaty was signed in Rome on October 27, 1946). Nenni severely criticized the Christian Democratic Party for following the reactionary policies of the United States. He said, "In our struggle against capitalism and to defend our country's independence, we are not only defending the rights of the Italian working class, but also the rights of the American working class." Nenni condemned the so-called "Third Force" saying, "Experience proves that this force often fails." Regarding the tasks of the Italian People's Democratic Front in the upcoming elections, Nenni pointed out, "This front must unite all people who are fighting to change our country's social structure." Palmiro Togliatti, representing the Italian Communist Party, delivered a brief congratulatory message to the congress. In discussing the elections to be held in April, Togliatti forcefully stated, "Our country is reaching a decisive stage in history." "The victory of the future elections depends on the unity of the Communist and Socialist parties." Togliatti urged the Socialist Party to fight to defend the principles of the Italian Constitution and to defend the victorious achievements of the working class.
