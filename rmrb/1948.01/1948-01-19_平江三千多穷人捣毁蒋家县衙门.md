Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: A dispatch from Changsha: In November of last year, in Pingjiang, northern Hunan, over three thousand poor people destroyed the county government and beat the Chiang bandit county chief in a heroic act. Because there were many poor people in the county, the peasants opposed the fact that all of the emergency relief supplies fell into the hands of the landlords and local bullies. When they were arrested by the Chiang bandit county government, they gathered over three thousand people and went to the police station to petition for their release. The police station stated that they were acting under the orders of the county government. Therefore, the large group, shouting the slogan "Return our people!", rushed into the county government. The Chiang bandit guards were shocked and scattered. The masses destroyed everything and dragged the Chiang bandit county chief from his tiger skin chair and beat him severely.

Another dispatch: Because more and more peasants in western Hunan counties are rising up to resist Chiang, the Chiang bandits are extremely anxious. They have designated Yongshun and other counties as "political suppression zones." Wang Dongyuan, chairman of the Chiang bandit provincial government, personally went to various places to give "instructions."

　　平江三千多穷人捣毁蒋家县衙门
    【新华社陕北十六日电】长沙讯：年前十一月间湘北平江发生三千余穷人捣毁县府痛殴蒋匪县长壮举。该县农民因有穷人多人，为了反对急赈物资全都落入地主土劣手中，被蒋匪县政府逮捕，就集会三千余人结队赴警察局请愿，要求释放。警局表示系受县府命令办理，于是大队就在“还我人来！”的口号声中拥入县府，蒋匪警卫大惊四散，群众捣毁一切，并将蒋匪县长从虎皮椅拖下痛殴一顿。
    又讯：蒋匪因湘西各县农民起义抗蒋者日多，焦虑异常，划永顺等县为“政治清剿区”，蒋匪省府主席王东原并亲往各地“训导”。
