　　Scenes of the Meeting of Chen Su and Chen Xie
　　季音
　　At 3:30 AM on the snowy night of December 25th, amidst a sudden and tremendous explosion, the two routes of the People's Liberation Army began their joint attack on the 20th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 3rd Division at Jingang Temple (south of Xiping). The assault team of Guo Jisheng's company from the Chen Su forces climbed over the deep trenches and high ground of Jingang Temple, broke into the north gate, and quickly occupied the commanding height of the Jingang Temple courtyard. At the same time, Zhang Yao's battalion of the Chen Xie forces, braving the intense firepower of the enemy's thirteen light machine guns, broke into Sun Village (west of Jingang Temple) in one fell swoop, compressing an enemy battalion into five courtyards. The enemy set fire to the houses in an attempt to stop the PLA's advance, and repeatedly launched desperate counterattacks, but were all beaten back by Guo Jisheng's company. Our follow-up troops poured into the breakthrough and fiercely advanced towards the main street. The enemy wavered, throwing their guns one by one outside the doors and shouting in the houses, "We surrender!" The remaining thousand-plus remnants fled wildly to the southwest. The soldiers of Yang's regiment from the Chen Su forces chased closely, and Zhang Feng's battalion of the Chen Xie forces, ambushed in Sun Village, greeted the fleeing Chiang bandits with dense bullets, ultimately preventing the Chiang bandits from escaping the dragnet.
　　After the battle, the soldiers of the two great armies, covered in snowflakes, rushed up together and shook hands warmly. A soldier from the Chen Su forces said, "Last New Year, our Central China troops and Shandong troops met, and the first battle was to annihilate the 26th Division and the 1st Rapid Column. This year, we meet with you and fought another beautiful battle." Then the soldiers of the Chen Xie forces asked about the Laiwu Victory and the Menglianggu Victory. A political instructor from the Chen Xie forces was recounting the scene of crossing the Yellow River.
　　Fan, the company commander of the Chen Xie forces, insisted on giving a machine gun and thirty-odd prisoners they had just captured to the comrades of the Chen Su forces who were pursuing the Chiang bandits. The soldiers of the Chen Su forces insisted on giving a large pile of rifles to the comrades of the Chen Xie forces. Everyone yielded to each other. Instructor Yao led a pack animal and insisted on letting a wounded soldier of the Chen Su forces, Guo Yun, ride back, saying, "We want to learn from you!" The reply was the same voice: "We want to learn from you!"

　　陈粟陈谢会师情景
    季音
    十二月二十五日雪夜三点半钟，在一片突然的巨大的爆响里，两路解放军开始夹攻金刚寺（西平南）蒋匪整三师第二十旅。陈粟部队郭继胜连突击队爬过了金刚寺的深沟高地突入北门，迅速占领制高点金刚寺大院。同时陈谢部队张姚营冒着敌人十三挺轻机枪的强大火网，一举突入孙庄（金刚寺西）。把敌人一个营压缩到五个院子里。敌人点燃了房子，企图阻止解放军前进，并且一次又一次的作最后挣扎性的反扑，都被郭继胜连打下去。我后续部队涌进了突破口，猛烈的向大街发展。敌人动摇了，把枪一支支的丢到门外，并在屋子里喊着：“我们缴枪啦！”其余一千多个残敌便连滚带爬的向西南狂奔，陈粟部队杨团的战士紧紧的追赶，预伏在孙庄的陈谢部队张锋营用密集的子弹迎接逃窜过来的蒋匪，终使蒋匪逃不出天罗地网。
    两支大军的战士们在战斗结束后，披着满身雪花一齐涌上来亲密的握手。一个陈粟部队的战士说：“去年新年我们华中部队和山东部队会合，第一仗就是歼灭了二十六师和第一快连纵队。今年我们和你们会合，又打了个漂亮仗。”接着陈谢部队战士就问莱芜大捷和孟良崮大捷的经过。一个陈谢部队的指导员则在叙述抢渡黄河的情景。
    陈谢部队范连长一定要把刚才缴的一挺机枪和三十几个俘虏送给追击蒋匪的陈粟部队的同志，陈粟部队的战士一定要把一大堆步枪送给陈谢部队同志，大家互相推让，姚教导员牵来一匹牲口，一定要一个负伤的陈粟部队郭运战士骑着回去。还说：“我们要向你们学习”，回答的却是同样一个声音：“我们要向你们学习！”
