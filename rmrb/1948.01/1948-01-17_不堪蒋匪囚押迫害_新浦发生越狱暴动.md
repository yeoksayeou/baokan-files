Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th. Qingdao newspapers report: Those detained in the Chiang bandit Donghai Court detention center in Xinpu, at the eastern end of the Longhai Railway, unable to endure persecution by the Chiang bandits, rose up in mutiny and broke out of prison. At 1:00 AM on November 30th, when the Chiang bandit guards were changing shifts, more than forty detainees in the west wing of the prison took the opportunity to extinguish the lights and simultaneously pushed down the cell door. More than forty detainees in the east wing had already loosened the mud and wood under the wooden bars. At this point they also pushed down the door, and together they rushed into the courtyard. While monitoring the guards, they rushed into the guard room to seize handguns. After locking up all the Chiang bandit guards, the more than ninety detainees jumped over the wall with ease and gained their freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. According to a Reuter's dispatch from Peiping on the 11th: "Rice riots have occurred in Changchun." Another report: All newspapers in Changchun have ceased publication and are issuing a joint edition.
