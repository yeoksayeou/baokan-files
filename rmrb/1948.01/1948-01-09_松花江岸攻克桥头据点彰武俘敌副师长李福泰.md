　　Songhua River Bank: Conquering the Bridgehead Stronghold, Capturing Enemy Deputy Division Commander Li Futai in Zhangwu
Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 7th. Our reporter Gao Ge reports: The bridgehead stronghold, isolated on the north bank of the Songhua River and fortified by permanent fortifications built by the Chiang bandits, was recovered by the Northeast People's Liberation Army on the 19th of last month. An enemy company from the 50th Division of the New First Army that broke through was completely annihilated on the 21st near Dafangshen, Dehui, on the south bank of the Songhua River. The reporter pointed out: The recapture of this bridgehead stronghold with permanent fortifications foreshadows the fate of Jilin and Changchun. After the Chiang bandits occupied the Songhua River bridgehead in the past, they worked on top of the original fortifications, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to spend tens of billions of Chiang currency, using Japanese and American technology, to build eighty-odd permanent above-ground and underground bunker complexes, touting this small piece of land as an "advance base to take Harbin in ten days"; however, in just one year, the People's Liberation Army has moved south thousands of miles, and all the Chiang bandit remnants in isolated strongholds in the liberated areas now have only two futures: either surrender or be annihilated.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 7th. In continuous operations by the Northeast People's Liberation Army, the names of Chiang bandit officers of the rank of colonel and above who have been killed or captured are being verified one after another. Currently, there is Li Futai, deputy division commander of the 79th Division, captured alive in the Zhangwu battle, and Cui Fuyi, lieutenant colonel and deputy regiment commander of the First Brigade of the Cavalry Officer Training Corps, Liu Kuangeng, major and deputy regiment commander, Gu Jingru, major and deputy battalion commander, and many other officers of the bandit cavalry captured alive in the Liguanpu battle outside Shenyang. Furthermore, on the 28th of last month, in the Wanjintai battle northwest of Shenyang, Cai Ji and Chen Jingzhi, the regimental commander and deputy regimental commander of the Sixth Regiment of the Second Brigade of the Bandit 207th Division, were both killed in action.

　　松花江岸攻克桥头据点彰武俘敌副师长李福泰
    【新华社东北前线七日电】本社记者高歌报导：孤悬松花江北岸，蒋匪建有永久性工事的桥头据点，已为东北解放军于上月十九日收复。突围之敌新一军五十师一个连，二十一日在松花江南岸德惠大房身附近被全部消灭。记者指出：这一筑有永久性工事桥头据点的收复，预示着吉林、长春命运的前途。蒋匪过去侵占松江桥头后，曾在原有的工事基础上，工上加工，强迫数十万人民，花费数十亿蒋币，借助日本、美国的技术，修成八十几个永久性明暗碉堡群，把这块弹丸之地，吹做“十天拿下哈尔滨的前进基地”；但是仅只一年，解放军已南下千里，一切残留在解放区孤立据点的蒋匪，不论是修筑多么坚固的工事，现在就只有两个前途：不是投降，就是被歼。
    【新华社东北前线七日电】东北人民解放军连日作战中，毙俘蒋匪校级以上军官陆续查明的，现又有彰武战斗中活捉之匪七十九师副师长李福泰，及沈阳外团李官堡战斗中活捉之匪骑兵军官训练队第一旅中校副团长崔富宜、少校团副刘宽庚、少校副营长古镜如等多名。又：上月二十八日，沈阳西北万金台战斗中，匪二○七师二旅六团正副团长蔡继、陈镜之均被击毙。
