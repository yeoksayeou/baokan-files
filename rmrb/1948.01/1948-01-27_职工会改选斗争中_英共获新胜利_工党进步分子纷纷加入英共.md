Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: London dispatch: According to the "Worker's Daily", in the recent trade union re-election struggle, the British Communist Party continues to achieve new and brilliant victories. In the election of the Transport and General Workers' Union (note: this is the largest trade union in Britain, with 1.3 million members), several well-known communists, such as Lement and Slack, have been re-elected as executive committee members of the union. In South Wales, despite official opposition, British Communist Party member Harris was re-elected as the national representative of the urban branch of the union. The Manchester Trades Council has rejected the unreasonable demand of Labor Party reactionary member Wallers to prohibit Communist Party members from being elected in trade union organizations, and expressed their love for the British Communist Party by electing Communist Party member Gorua as the chairman of the union. British Communist Party member Tilbury has been elected as a member of the London District Committee of the Electrical Trades Union. The number of votes he received was more than the total number of votes of the other four candidates. At the same time, local trade unions in London are rising up to resolutely fight against the anti-communist conspiracy of the Labor Party. The London West Branch of the Association of Scientific Workers has recently rejected the reactionary proposal of some reactionary trade union bureaucrats to remove Communist Party members from leading positions in trade unions. The Kennington (South London) Trades Council, as well as three local trade unions, including the machinists and electrical workers, have resolved to condemn the anti-communist movement launched by Labor Party leader Philip. Progressive elements in the Labor Party are increasingly dissatisfied with the party's reactionary policies. For example, Simpson, a well-known member of the Scottish Denny and East Dunbartonshire Labor Party local party and city council member, Livingstone, the vice-chairman of the Denny Labor Party branch, and MacGrinles, the branch secretary of the party, have recently voluntarily left the party and joined the British Communist Party.

  　英共获新胜利
  　工党进步分子纷纷加入英共
    【新华社陕北廿五日电】伦敦讯：据工人日报讯：最近数日英共在职工会改选斗争中，继续获得新的辉煌胜利。在运输业及各业工人工会（按这是英国最大的职工会，有一百卅万会员）的选举中，著名共产党人莱孟特与斯拉克等数人，已再度当选为该工会执行委员。在南威尔士，即使有官方的反对，英共哈里斯仍被连选连任为该工会城市区支部的全国代表。曼彻斯特工会委员会已否决工党反动党员瓦勒斯所提不准英共党人在工会团体中当选的无理要求，并以选举共产党人高鲁亚为该工会主席，来表示他们对英共的爱戴。英共党员梯尔伯利，已被选为电汽工会伦敦区委员会委员。他所获得的票数，比其他四个候选人的总票数还要多。同时，伦敦各地方工会纷起与工党反共阴谋作坚决斗争。科学工人协会伦敦西区分会，顷已否决了某些反动工会官僚所提革除共产党人在职工会中领导地位的反动建议。堪伯威尔（伦敦南部）工会委员会职工以及机器匠及电汽工人等三个地方工会，决议谴责工党头子菲利浦所发动的反共运动。工党中的进步分子对该党反动政策日益不满。例如苏格兰的丁尼与东尼白斯工党地方党著名党员市议会议员辛浦生、丁尼工党支部副主席李文斯东与该党支书麦克格林勒斯，最近已自动脱离该党加入英共。
