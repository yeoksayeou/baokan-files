　　Northeast Winter Offensive Scores Another Great Victory
  　Annihilation of the Enemy's Division at Xinlitun
  　Democratic Government Established in Xinmin County, Distributing Grain to Hired Laborers and Poor Peasants, Resolutely Implementing the Policy of Uniting with Middle Peasants and Protecting Industry and Commerce
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, Urgent Telegram, 27th] The Northeast People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the Nationalist strategic stronghold of Xinlitun's defending enemy, the 26th Division of the 49th Army, yesterday morning. The results of the battle are currently being investigated. The destruction of the 26th Division is the fourth complete division annihilated since the start of our Northeast Winter Offensive. Xinlitun is located more than 200 li east of Shenyang, and is an important connecting point for the two railways of Da (Hushan)-Tong (Liao) and Xin (Litun)-Yi (County).
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th] After the Liberation Army recovered the vast rural areas of Xinmin County in the Winter Offensive, it immediately assisted the local masses in establishing democratic government and local armed forces, launching a vigorous grain distribution movement. Democratic governments have been universally established at the county, district, and village levels, and militias have been established in each village. The local armed forces in the county and districts have also developed rapidly, with farmers seizing 700 guns from landlords. Poor peasant leagues have been established in 117 natural villages in the sixth, seventh, eighth, and third districts of the county, and class division is being further carried out in preparation for equal distribution of land. The poor peasants in more than 40 villages in the south of the county have recently launched accusations of suffering, distributing grain and windfall wealth, and seizing more than 400 guns from landlords. South of the Beining Railway, the masses prepared bags to distribute grain as soon as they saw our army. When our army was fighting in Manduhu, nearly 2,000 farmers in the area automatically distributed the grain of Nationalist landlords. Many farmers automatically requested to join our army. In helping the masses distribute grain, the Liberation Army resolutely implemented the policy of uniting with middle peasants (such as not taking grain from those at or below the level of middle peasants) and protecting industry and commerce. Another report: The Red East Sub-district Battlefield Work Group went deep into the Nationalist-occupied areas with the army to mobilize the masses. In mid-November of last year, it mobilized more than 30 villages including Daziying between the Jinzhou-Chengde Railway and the Daling and Xiaoling Rivers, and the farmers distributed more than one million jin of grain and a large amount of other windfall wealth. On average, each person received 300 jin of grain, two pieces of clothing and bedding, two farm tools, and one head of livestock. Poor peasant groups also began to be established during the distribution of grain and windfall wealth.

　　东北冬季攻势又获一大胜利
  　新立屯歼守敌一师
  　新民县已建立民主政权分粮食给雇贫坚决贯彻团结中农保护工商业的政策
    【新华社东北前线二十七日急电】东北人民解放军昨天上午全部歼灭蒋匪战略要点新立屯守敌四十九军二十六师，战果正清查中。二十六师的覆没为东北我冬季攻势展开后被歼灭的第四个整师。按新立屯东距沈阳二百余里，系大（虎山）通（辽）与新（立屯）义（县）两铁路重要连接点。
    【新华社东北二十七日电】解放军在冬季攻势中收复新民县广大乡村后，即协助当地群众成立民主政权与地方武装，掀起猛烈的分粮运动。该县县、区、村民主政权已普遍建立，各村并均建立民兵，县区地方武装也迅速发展，农民收缴地主枪支达七百支。该县六、七、八三区一百十七个自然村都已成立贫雇团，并进一步进行划分阶级，准备平分土地。该县南部四十余村贫雇，最近也都掀起诉苦，分粮分浮财，收缴地主枪支四百余支。北宁路南，群众一见我军就拿口袋准备分粮。我军在满都户作战时，该地近二千农民即自动分了蒋匪地主的粮食。不少农民均自动要求参加我军。解放军在帮助群众分粮中，坚决贯彻了团结中农（如不吃中农以下的粮食等）与保护工商业的政策。另讯：热东分区战地工作团，随军深入蒋占区发动群众，去年十一月中旬，在锦承铁路与大小凌河间发动了达子营等三十余村，农民分粮达百万余斤及其他浮财甚多。平均每人分得粮食三百斤，衣服被褥二件，农具两件，牲口一头。并在分粮分浮财中开始建立起贫雇小组。
