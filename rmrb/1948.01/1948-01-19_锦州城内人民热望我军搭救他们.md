Xinhua News Agency, Ji Cha Re Liao, 14th: Under the influence of the continuous victories of the People's Liberation Army's winter offensive, the Chiang bandits in Jinzhou are extremely panicked. The general public, on the other hand, are eager for the People's Liberation Army to rescue them as soon as possible. Recently, the Chiang bandits only dare to patrol ten or eight li outside the city during the day, and shrink back into the city at night. The landlords and local bullies in the countryside are in a state of constant anxiety, and they have fled into the city one after another. Not only is the atmosphere in the city tense, with several scares a day, but also prices are soaring and miscellaneous taxes are heavy. In mid-last month, sorghum rice rose from 50,000 to 80,000 Chiang bandit's circulating currency per dou, and coal rose to 300 yuan per jin. The heavy miscellaneous taxes can be illustrated by the case of a poor household of three in Beiguan, who have no land or property: in October of last year, the household was forced to pay 1,500 yuan for consolation fees, 25,000 yuan for city defense fees, and 1,000 yuan for the district office's operating expenses. Han Bin, the principal of the municipal senior primary school, cannot afford to eat with his monthly salary and has to make a living by selling scraps in his spare time. A tragedy occurred in Beiguan where a poor household of five hanged themselves because they were driven to a dead end by the Chiang bandits' debt collection. In order to survive, more than 20,000 poor people in the city gathered together and robbed both the Beidoukou and the city's two grain markets. While robbing, they shouted: "If we don't rob grain, we will starve to death. The common people cannot survive in the areas occupied by the Central Government (Chiang bandits)!" The citizens, living in dire straits, are looking forward to the People's Liberation Army entering the city day and night. The people who were forced to repair the city moat said, "This is digging a grave for the Central Army (Chiang bandits)." They hate Chiang Kai-shek and call Chiang Kai-shek's "birthday fee" a funeral fee. The Chiang bandit soldiers guarding the city said, "We will hand over our guns when the Eighth Route Army comes!" The currency of our democratic government in Rehe Province enjoys extremely high credit among the people in the Chiang area. In the past, the exchange rate with the Chiang bandit's circulating currency was one to one, but by the 15th of last month, it had risen to one to five. People holding Chiang currency in Nuanchitang, Hongluoxian, Gaoqiao and other places have converted it into the democratic government's banknotes for safekeeping.

　　锦州城内人民热望我军搭救他们
    【新华社冀察热辽十四日电】解放军冬季攻势连续胜利影响下，锦州蒋匪慌张异常。一般市民则都渴望解放军快些搭救他们。近来蒋匪白天放哨仅敢出城十里八里，晚间即龟缩城中。四乡地主恶霸惶惶不可终日，纷纷逃入城内。而城内不仅风声鹤唳，一日数惊，且又物价狂涨，苛杂繁重。上月中旬，高粱米每斗由蒋匪流通券五万元涨到八万元，煤涨至每斤三百元。苛杂繁重可引北关一家房地全无的三口人的穷户为例：年前十月份该户被迫交慰劳费一千五百元、城防费二万五千元、区公所办公费一千元。市立高小校长韩滨月薪不够吃饭，只好靠课余卖破烂维生。北关曾发生一家五口穷户被蒋匪催逼走头无路上吊自杀的惨剧。为求生存全市二万多贫民曾集合起来将北斗口及市内两粮市一起抢光，他们一面抢一面高喊：“不抢粮咱们就得饿死，中央（蒋匪）占的地方老百姓活不成了！”市民在水深火热中日夜盼望着人民解放军进城。被迫修城壕的人民说：“这是给中央军（蒋匪）挖坟墓”。他们痛恨蒋介石，把蒋介石的“寿日费”称为送丧费。守城的蒋匪士兵则说“八路军来了我们就交枪！”我民主政府的热河省钞，在蒋区人民中信用极高，过去与蒋匪流通券兑换率为一比一，到上月十五已涨到一比五。暖池塘、虹螺岘、高桥等地持有蒋币人民，纷纷将之兑换成民主政府钞票保藏。
