　　Stone Cave Branch Secretary Runs Rampant
  　Masses Rise Up to Impeach Him
    [Our Dispatch] Duan Bingnan, the branch secretary of Shidong Village in Wu'an, embezzled fruits of victory and bullied the masses. This time, he also refused to join the army. The people rose up to take charge and impeach him. The story is as follows: During the conscription movement last November, the masses in each group were brewing the idea that "the political director should join the army," but no one dared to mobilize him. Later, Duan Pianyou and two others were willing to join the army and challenged Duan Bingnan. Pianyou's father said, "Shouldn't Duan Bingnan join the army? Considering the number of brothers (he has three), he should go. Considering the example set by cadres, he should also go." (He had signed up for the army three times in the past, but he was just lying and never went.) At the meeting, the masses proposed, "We are all willing to join the army and request the political director (i.e., the branch secretary) to lead us together." Duan Bingnan arrogantly said, "I will not lead you rabble." The masses raised a stern question: "What is your thinking if you don't join the army? If you don't want to go, who will you mobilize? Will our village's conscription work be done or not?" Duan Bingnan unreasonably said, "I will not join the army. I have two and a half jin to rely on (referring to his head). My thinking is not as good as a backward person. If the conscription work is not done, then it is completed." After Duan finished speaking, everyone was very angry. Comrade Yang Erxi, a district cadre, believed that this situation affected the conscription work and immediately detained Duan.
    After Duan was detained, the masses' concerns were: "Now that he is detained, after the new soldiers leave, he will still be the political director and will definitely retaliate, and we will still be bullied." Therefore, they were still unwilling to actively carry out the conscription work. Later, the district office decided that this time it must protect the democratic rights of the masses and support the masses. District Chief Wang personally went to Shidong to announce to the masses: "Duan Bingnan's problem will be completely handled by the masses. Whether he will be a cadre in the future will be decided by the masses." In the summary of the conscription meeting, the masses proposed: Duan Bingnan must be dismissed because he has done too many bad things. In the struggle last spring, the emancipated peasant Duan Xianghua bought a house in the same courtyard as Duan Bingnan. Duan Bingnan wanted to occupy it exclusively, so he sent the head of the peasants' association to talk to Duan Xianghua: "Exchange your house for the house of the political director's uncle (whose property belonged to Duan Bingnan after his death). If you are unwilling to exchange, Duan Bingnan said that you delivered eggs to the Japanese in Yetao Village in the past, so you have a problem." Duan Xianghua was unwilling to exchange and cried all night in anger. Later, a public security officer also went to threaten him, saying, "Exchange it with them, or it will be terrible." Duan Xianghua was forced and had no choice but to exchange houses. When the village distributed the fruits of struggle, it was not decided by the masses' discussion. At the meeting, Duan Bingnan said that whoever he wanted to give it to, he would give it to. Zhang Shutang, the head of the cooperative, was a Communist Party member of hired worker origin. Seeing this bad behavior, he criticized him. Duan Bingnan arrogantly said, "I am the branch secretary. I am solely responsible for whether the work is done well or badly." In the leveling and replenishment work, Duan Tianchu said in private, "Why do the cadres get more fruits of victory than us?" After Duan Bingnan found out, he "mobilized" a small number of people to attack him, saying that he was disrupting and sabotaging, and wanted to beat him and hang him up. Zhang Shutang begged the masses to intercede for him, and he was not beaten. As a result, Duan Bingnan decided: "Duan Tianchu is fined to return all the fruits of struggle he was given, and he is forbidden to attend meetings and speak for twenty days." Duan Bingnan was a declining rich peasant. In the struggle, he pretended to be a poor peasant and was given more than ten mu of good land and a good house. He was in charge of various accounts such as village finances and the fruits of struggle. The masses discussed one after another: "Duan Bingnan doesn't work hard, why can he eat and dress well, and buy a big donkey?" As a result, after auditing the accounts of the fruits of victory that he managed, he embezzled more than 60,000 yuan. Last August, the cooperative sold two donkeys. He deliberately set the price very low. The method of buying was for households without donkeys to decide by drawing paper balls. Whoever got it would buy it. A total of six people bought it. Duan Bingnan secretly colluded with four people to draw paper balls for him. Under his manipulation, he bought a big donkey. He was involved in corruption with the family member of a soldier fighting the enemy [抗属]. The masses raised opinions, asking him to confess and reflect, and said that if he reflected well, he could still participate in the peasants' association. If he did not reflect well, he would temporarily withdraw from the peasants' association. Duan Bingnan was unwilling to reflect, but arrogantly said, "That's just how I think." The masses decided to temporarily expel him from the peasants' association and return the donkey he bought at a low price.
    The district office expressed its full agreement and support for the opinions of the masses in Shidong. Comrade Zhang Xiuliang, the district secretary, said: "We are determined to let the masses impeach and transform bad cadres like Duan Bingnan, and we will never tolerate them." (Fang Dong)

　　石洞支书横行霸道
  　群众起来将他罢免
    【本报消息】武安石洞村支部书记段炳南，贪污果实，欺侮群众，这次又拒绝参军，老百姓起来当了一次家，把他罢免了。事情的经过是：去年十一月参军运动中，各组群众都酝酿：“政治主任应当去参军”，但谁也不敢去动员他。后来段偏有等三人愿去参军，提出和段炳南挑战；偏有爹说：“段炳南就不应该去参军吗？论兄弟多少（他兄弟三个）他应当去，论干部带头他也应当去”。（他过去曾三次报名参军，但都是骗人，始终未去。）在大会上群众提出：“我们都愿意参军，要求政治主任（即支部书记）带领我们一同去”。段炳南傲慢地说：“我就不带领你们这伙群众。”群众提出严正质问：“你不参军是啥思想？你不愿去，动员谁去，咱村的参军工作还做不做？”段炳南蛮不讲理地说：“我就不去参军，我有二斤半顶着（指头），我的思想还不如一个落后群众，参军工作不做就算完成。”段讲完后，大家很气愤，区干杨二喜同志认为这种情况影响参军工作，立即将段扣起。
    段被扣后，群众的思想顾虑是：“现在把人家扣着，新战士走后，人家还是政治主任，一定要报复，咱们还得受欺压。”因此仍不愿积极进行参军工作。后由区署决定，这次一定要保障群众的民主权利，给群众撑腰。王区长并亲自去石洞向群众宣布：“段炳南的问题，完全交群众处理，今后他当不当干部，由群众决定。”在总结参军会议中，群众提出：段炳南必须撤职，因为他办的坏事太多了。去年春天斗争中，翻身农民段祥华买了一座房子，和段炳南同院，段炳南想独占，便派农会主任和段祥华谈：“你的房子和政治主任伯父（年老死后财产是段炳南的）房子换一下，你若不愿换，段炳南说过去你给冶陶村日本人送过鸡蛋，有问题。”段祥华不愿换，气得哭了一夜。后来公安员也去威胁说：“和人家换吧，不换不得了。”段祥华被迫无法，只得换房。村里分斗争果实，不是群众评议的，在大会上段炳南说分给谁就分给谁。合作社长张书堂是雇工出身的共产党员，看到这种恶劣行为，曾批评过他，段炳南骄傲地说：“我是支部书记，工作做好做坏，由我一人负责。”填平补齐中，段天初背地说：“干部分的果实，为啥都比咱们多？”段炳南知道后“发动”少数群众攻击他，说他破坏捣乱，要打他吊他。张书堂向群众哀求说情，才算没有被打，结果段炳南决定：“罚段天初把分的斗争果实全部退出来，并且罚他二十天不准开会说话。”段炳南是一个破落的富农，他在斗争中冒充贫民，分好地十余亩，好房一座，他管着村财政、斗争果实等各种帐目。群众纷纷议论：“段炳南不好好劳动，为啥能吃好穿好，还买个大驴？”结果把他管的果实帐清算后，贪污六万余元。去年八月合作社卖两个驴，他故意把价格订得很低，买的办法是没驴户拿纸蛋决定，谁拿着谁买，共有六个人买，段炳南就暗中串通四个人替他拿纸蛋，在他操纵下，买到一个大驴。他和抗属××搞腐化，群众提出意见，要他坦白反省，并说反省的好，让他仍然参加农会，若不好好反省就暂时退出农会。段炳南不愿反省，反而傲慢地说：“我的思想就是这样。”群众决定把他暂时开除农会，并将他贱价买的驴退回。
    区署对石洞群众的意见表示十分赞同与支持，区书张秀亮同志说：“我们对段炳南这样的坏干部，下决心让群众去罢免他改造他，决不姑息。”（方动）
