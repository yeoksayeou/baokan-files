Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Moscow dispatch: Labor Daily commented on the "Marshall Plan" on the 9th, stating that Vandenberg, a proponent of the "Marshall Plan," intends to cross out the "17 billion dollar figure" in the "Marshall Plan" bill, reflecting: First, the "Marshall Plan" has encountered strong opposition from the broad masses of the American people. Second, due to the impending US presidential election, both the Democratic and Republican parties are unwilling to bear the responsibility for the "Marshall Plan," as the plan is extremely unpopular among the broad masses in the United States, in order to win votes. Third, the rapid deterioration of the situation in some countries under the dollar yoke. For example, Greece, despite the "aid" of gold dollars, has still led to the defeat of the royalist fascists. Fourth, the members of the US Congress have been shocked by the perilous state of the economic crisis in Western European countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: News from various sources: Just as the US Congress is discussing the "Marshall Plan," newspapers in Western European countries, from progressive to reactionary, are criticizing it, indicating that the aggressiveness of the "Marshall Plan" is becoming increasingly "obvious" (TASS). The British Communist Party's organ, the Daily Worker, stated on the 7th: "The truth is now clear: the United States intends to dump certain goods in Europe, and for this purpose, it will restrict the production of goods in Europe that would compete with the United States." The reactionary "Daily Express" also said on the 8th: "According to the 'Marshall Plan,' more than half of the total value of American supplies to Britain is used for non-essential goods, so it is absurd for Britain to think that the plan can save it from economic disaster." The Danish newspaper "Holbaek Amts Social-Demokrat" stated on the 12th: "The 'charitable face' of the Marshall Plan is only to achieve a commercial purpose, and those who are aided must accept conditions equivalent to the orders of a leader." Some Danish newspapers have even protested against the United States' desire to sell old ships to Denmark, and even the government organ "Social-Demokraten" and the conservative "Berlingske Tidende" have "satirically commented on the Marshall Plan" in their columns. "Berlingske Tidende" also published a cartoon comparing Denmark to a cow longing for doughnuts, while mocking the Marshall Plan for giving it tobacco instead. The Rotterdam business community's organ, "Rotterdamsch Nieuwsblad," stated on the 12th: "During the war, the United States built a large number of merchant ships, which are now outdated, and now the United States wants to 'lend' them to the Netherlands. If the American demands are met, our shipbuilding industry and other revitalizing industries will suffer a heavy blow."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Washington dispatch: The American people fiercely oppose the Marshall Plan. The American afternoon newspaper has recently published many letters from readers, all of which are opposed to the Marshall Plan. One of them, Adoulay, wrote: "The Marshall Plan is a carefully formulated plan by Wall Street, with the assistance of the US government, to dominate the world." Picolet is convinced that this plan "cannot solve the economic difficulties of Western Europe." Jennings wrote: This will "amount to establishing fascist governments in Western Europe." Slaton believes that the Marshall Plan is "doomed to failure" because it will "greatly accelerate inflation in the United States." Vorner said: "The Marshall Plan will sow the seeds of discord and lead to new wars." Agilas said: "The purpose of this plan is to combat the progress and liberalism of various countries under the guise of 'red terror,' but this plan sows the seeds of hatred and will inevitably reap its own consequences." Even the reactionary New York Times was forced to admit the opposition of the broad masses of the American people to the Marshall Plan. The newspaper published the results of its reporter's survey of public opinion in more than a dozen major cities on the 6th, stating: "People in the central and western regions of the United States have expressed opposition to the Marshall Plan," and "people in many regions have expressed considerable indifference."

　　“老鼠过街人人喊打”
  　马歇尔计划继续遭痛斥
    【新华社陕北十六日电】莫斯科讯：劳动报于九日评论“马歇尔计划”称：鼓励“马歇尔计划”的辩护人范登。堡拟将“马歇尔计划”法案中的“一百七十亿美元的数字”勾销一事，反映了：第一、“马歇尔计划”遇到了美国广大人民的强烈反对。第二、由于美总统选举期近，为了争取选票，民主和共和两党都不愿多担负“马歇尔计划”的责任，因该计划在美国广大群众中非常不得人心。第三、在美元枷锁下的某些国家局势的急转直下。例如希腊，尽管金元怎样“援助”，但仍使保皇党法西斯分子遭受失败。第四、美国国会议员已被西欧各国的经济危机的险境所震惊。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】各方讯：正当美国会讨论“马歇尔计划”的时候，西欧各国报纸，从进步的到反动的都纷纷予以抨斥，这表示“马歇尔计划”的侵略性，更益“变得明显”（塔斯社）。英共机关报工人日报七日称：“真相现已大白，美国是打算在欧洲倾销某些货品，为此就要限制欧洲生产那些会与美国竞争的货品。”反动的“每日快报”亦于八日说：“按照‘马歇尔计划’，美国对英供应的总值，其中用于非必需品的，占了一半以上，所以，对英国来说，认为该计划可以把英国从经济灾难中拯救出来，是荒谬的。”丹麦的“荷尔贝卡茨社会民主党人报”于十二日称：“马歇尔计划的‘慈善面孔’，只是要达到一种商业目的，被援助者必须接受等于领袖命令的一些条件”。若干丹麦报纸更抗议美国想把旧船卖给丹麦，连政府机关报“社会民主党人”报和保守的“贝林斯克日报”，也在专栏中“讽剌地评论马歇尔计划”。“贝林斯克日报”还刊载了一幅漫画，把丹麦比成一条渴望油饼的母牛，而讥剌马歇尔计划却给它以烟草。荷兰鹿特丹企业界的机关报“鹿特丹新闻”于十二日称：“在战争期中，美国造了大量商船，这些商船已陈旧，而现在美国却想把它们‘借’给荷兰，假如满足了美国要求，我们的造船业及其他复兴工业，将遭受沉重的打击。”
    【新华社陕北十六日电】华盛顿讯：美国人民猛烈反对马歇尔计划。美国下午报最近连续发表了许多读者来信，都是反对马歇尔计划的，其中阿都莱写道：“马歇尔计划是代表华尔街在美国政府协助下精心拟定的统治全世界的计划”。皮柯莱深信：这计划“不能解决西欧经济困难问题”。金宁斯写道：这将“等于建立西欧各法西斯政府”。斯莱顿认为马歇尔计划“注定了要失败”，因为它将“大大地加速美国的通货膨胀”。佛纳称：“马歇尔计划将散下纠纷的种子、导向新战争”。阿吉拉斯说：“这种计划的目的是要在‘红色恐怖’的掩饰下打击各国的进步和自由主义，但这一计划种下的是仇恨的种子，必将自食其果”。即使反动的纽约时报亦被迫供认美国广大人民反对马歇尔计划的情形。该报于六日发表其记者在十余个主要都市测验民意的结果称：“美国中部与西部地区人民对马歇尔计划表示反对”，“很多地区人民颇表冷淡”。
