Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: TASS, Belgrade, reported on the 26th of last month: The Greek Provisional Government recently issued a declaration to the whole country stating: In view of the urgent need created by the foreign imperialists' attempt to destroy Greek national independence, in view of the actual non-existence of the Greek national government, and in view of the development of the Greek national democratic movement, the growth of the democratic army and its combat effectiveness, we have established the Greek Provisional Democratic Government. The main and urgent task of the democratic government is to work with the masses of the people to make every effort to liberate Greece from the shackles of foreign imperialism and its running dogs, and to strive for the restoration of independence and the victory of Greek democracy. The democratic government will take all measures to develop people's democratic institutions, people's courts, national education and carry out reforms (including land reform) to meet the basic needs of the people in the liberated areas and newly liberated areas, and strive for national unity based on national independence and respect for the democratic rights and freedoms of the people. The democratic government will restore friendly relations with the people and governments of all democratic countries. The democratic government firmly believes that its strength and power come from the people, and as soon as conditions permit, it will immediately convene a National Assembly - a unicameral people's representative body. The declaration pointed out that the destruction of Greek national independence by American and British imperialism and the destruction of democracy by the royalist fascists have made the establishment of a democratic government necessary as a manifestation of the highest interests of the Greek nation. The declaration thoroughly exposed the shameful acts of the Tsaldaris-Sophoulis group and its running dogs, and strongly condemned the ambitions of British and American imperialism, saying: They are trying to turn Greece into a slave state and turn it into a base for enslaving the people, opposing the Balkan democratic countries and the great ally of the Greek people, the Soviet Union's imperialist policy.
