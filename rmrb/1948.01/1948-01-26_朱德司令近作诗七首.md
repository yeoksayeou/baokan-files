　　Seven Recent Poems by Commander Zhu De

　　Rural Areas After Land Reform

　　Thousands of households rejoice in the morning glow,
　　Purple auroras appear everywhere in the villages.
　　Liberated farmers sing joyfully,
　　The domineering iron clouds fly high away.
　　Land is divided, and plowing is a pleasure;
　　Sweeping away the remnants, worries disappear.
　　The rising youth are mostly talented and handsome,
　　In the high autumn, test the horses, strong and fat.

　　The War Situation and the Current Situation

　　From the Hinggan Mountains to the Chu River's head,
　　Ten thousand miles of war fire meet the bleak autumn.
　　The reason for annihilating the enemy is the widespread land distribution,
　　Raising troops is only to relieve the people's sorrow.
　　Fascism acts like jackals and tigers,
　　The democratic upsurge surpasses America and Europe.
　　Four hundred million people strive for liberation,
　　Eradicate feudalism and build a divine land.

　　The Counter-Offensive

　　War has always been like playing chess,
　　If the moves are decisive, there will be no grief.
　　The people's liberation creates a new life,
　　The demise of feudalism is different from the past.
　　The northern land has long become a solid rock,
　　The southern expedition still complains of slow progress.
　　Autumn wind sends geese returning with a message:
　　Unite to destroy the Chiang bandits, think no more.

　　To the Generals of the Southern Expedition

　　Generals of the southern expedition, build great achievements,
　　Victory is entirely in your grasp.
　　The traitorous warlords are terrified like falling leaves,
　　The morale of the mighty army surpasses the autumn wind.
　　The dictatorial regime sinks into dark clouds,
　　Liberation flags are red across the land.
　　Clean up the beautiful rivers and mountains,
　　Let all the people be masters of their own destiny.

　　To the Generals of the Northeast

　　Southern people going north, winding and long,
　　Garrisoning Liaoyang, entering the mountain slopes.
　　Glory and achievements are happily achieved together,
　　Beautiful flowers bloom splendidly on connected branches.
　　Friendly neighbors often inquire,
　　Benevolent communities are peaceful and secure forever.
　　The day of sweeping away Fascism and returning horses,
　　The whole world will admire your great fame.

　　Annihilating Chiang Kai-shek's Third Army

　　The setting sun slants in Nanhai Village,
　　Frequent cries for help, hoping for aid from Nanjing.
　　To rescue Baoding, the Third Army is annihilated,
　　Mistakenly crossing Hutuo River in the ninth month.
　　Disarming, they all speak of returning to their hometowns,
　　Leaving the camp, the bugle is no longer heard.
　　Please look at the deep autumn moon above the border,
　　Brightly illuminating the flowers of victory in the border region.

　　Recovering Shijiazhuang

　　Shijiazhuang blocked the Taihang Mountains,
　　The brave warriors opened it with ease.
　　Annihilating the entire army and recovering the important town,
　　Not allowing the barbarian horses to return to the Qin Pass.
　　Opening a new chapter in siege tactics,
　　The long-suffering people break into smiles.
　　Our Party's heroes emerge in true succession,
　　From now on, no need to worry about gray hair.

　　朱德司令近作诗七首
　　土改后的农村
　
    千门万户喜朝晖　处处村头现紫微
    解放农人歌自得　专横铁乌云高飞
    平田有分躬耕乐　扫地无余心事违
    后起青年多俊秀　秋高试马壮而肥
　
　　战局时局
　
    兴安岭下楚江头　万里烽烟接素秋
    灭敌原因分地遍　兴师只为解民愁
    法西当道如豺虎　民主高潮胜美欧
    四万万人争解放　铲除封建建神州
　
　　反攻
　
    战事从来似奕棋　举棋若定自无悲
    人民解放成新生　封建灭亡异昔时
    北地早成磐石固　南征犹怨旌旗迟
    秋风送雁归传语　共灭蒋獠莫再思
　
　　寄南征诸将
　
    南征诸将建奇功　胜算全操在掌中
    国贼军心惊落叶　雄师士气胜秋风
    独裁政体沉云黑　解放旌旗满地红
    锦绣山河收拾好　万民尽作主人翁
　
　　寄东北诸将
　
    南人北去自逶迤　远戍辽阳入岭陂
    勋业辉煌欣共举　名花灿烂喜连枝
    邻居友善长相问　仁里安康永莫移
    扫尽法西归马日　寰球同仰大名垂
　
　　消灭蒋匪第三军
　
    南合村中晓日斜　频呼救命望京华
    为援保定三军灭　错渡呼图九月槎
    卸甲咸云归故里　离营从此不闻笳
    请看塞上深秋月　朗照边区胜利花
　
　　收复石门
　
    石门封锁太行山　勇士掀开指顾间
    消灭全师收重镇　不教胡马返秦关
    攻坚战术开新面　久困人民开笑颜
    我党英雄真辈出　从今不虑月鬓毛斑
