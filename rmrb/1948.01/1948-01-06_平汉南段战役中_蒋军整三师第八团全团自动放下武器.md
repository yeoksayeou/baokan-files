Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 31st – During the battle in the Xiping area of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, the 8th Regiment of the 3rd Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line 3rd Division, led by Regiment Commander Chen Dehua, voluntarily laid down their arms. On the evening of the 26th, before the final general offensive to encircle and annihilate the 3rd Division, our troops heavily surrounded the regiment in an area 30 li southwest of Zaoziya Village. After a brief engagement, our commanders and soldiers began shouting to the regiment. The soldiers of the regiment stopped firing one after another. Tian, the political commissar of one of our regiments, issued a warning to the officers and soldiers of the regiment at 5:10 PM, ordering them to voluntarily lay down their arms before 6:00 PM. Those who violated the order would be annihilated, and those who complied with the order would receive preferential treatment. At 5:30 PM, Chen Dehua sent his Major Regimental Adjutant Zhu Jinxin to contact the Liberation Army, bringing with him a letter in his own handwriting stating: They would come with their troops at 6:00 PM and requesting a designated location. From 6:10 PM to 6:30 PM, Regiment Commander Chen, together with Lieutenant Colonel Deputy Regiment Commander Zhou Jianzhong, Major Battalion Commander of the 1st Battalion Chen Yili, and others, personally led 764 officers and soldiers to lay down their arms in order. They surrendered seven mortars, 59 various machine guns, and other weapons and ammunition. Our troops then escorted them safely to the liberated area. This regiment was the main force of the 3rd Division, and officers at all levels were military academy students. Its 3rd Battalion Commander had been wounded by our forces, the 7th Company was annihilated in Luohe on the 19th, and the 9th Company was annihilated in Luozhuang on the 25th. The 2nd Battalion had gone to the Zhengzhou area to receive new recruits and had not returned. According to Regiment Commander Chen, "I feel that it is too worthless to sacrifice myself for a dictator's civil war. If we continue to fight against your army, the entire division will be annihilated. The vast majority of soldiers also unanimously expressed their willingness to come over, because this side is better than that side."
