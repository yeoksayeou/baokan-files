Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, January 17th: The people of the Northeast Liberated Areas added a total of 1,529 kilometers of railways last year. The total operating mileage of railways in the Northeast Liberated Areas is now 6,800 kilometers. In North Manchuria, the newly built railways that have been opened to traffic since the beginning of this year total 920 kilometers, including the Jiamusi-Fujin line, the Ningnian-Nenjiang line, and the Suihua-Jiamusi line. The Jiamusi Bridge, which was restored, is second in size only to the Yellow River Railway Bridge. The Binjiang-Suifenhe line, the Huolonggou Forestry Branch Line (from Baishan to Huolonggou), the Wuchang to Lafa section of the Lafa-Binjiang line, the Lafa to Erdaogou section of the Changchun-Tumen line, and the Shuanggang to Zhengjiatun (Liaoyuan) section of the Siping-Qiqihar line have also been repaired. The Zhengjiatun-Tongliao line is currently under construction. In South Manchuria, the railway lines recovered by the People's Liberation Army during last summer's offensive were successively opened to traffic by last November after the efforts of railway workers to repair them. These include the Meihekou to Shuanghezhen section of the Jilin-Shenyang line, the Meihekou to Qingyuan section, the Meihekou to Xi'an section of the Siping-Meihekou line, and the Yayuanchu branch line (from Yayuan to Linjiang) of the Meihekou-Jian line, totaling 600 kilometers. The entire Meihekou-Jian line is expected to be open to traffic by the end of February this year. The vast majority of the road workers are emancipated peasants, so even though the weather is freezing and the ground is as hard as iron, they still get up early and work late to enthusiastically repair the railways. For example, road workers in South Manchuria built 273 kilometers of railways, 30 large and small bridges, and erected 250 kilometers of power lines in 57 days. They also automatically organized "Material Collection Committees" to collect various materials. Dong'an County alone collected more than 50,000 track spikes. On New Year's Day this year, grand opening ceremonies were held for the Jiafu line, the Labin line, and other lines. The Railway Bureau offered free rides to all passengers on that day to thank the people and military and government agencies for their assistance.

　　东北翻身农民去年增修铁路三千里
    【新华社东北十七日电】东北解放区人民去年一年中共增修铁路一千五百二十九公里。现在东北解放区铁路通车里程已共有六千八百公里。北满方面今年年初新修铁路先后通车的有九百二十公里，计有佳（木斯）富（锦）线，宁（年）嫩（江）线，绥（化）佳（木斯）线，其中修复之佳木斯大桥仅小于黄河铁桥，滨（江）绥（芬河）线，火龙沟林业支线（白山到火龙沟），拉（法）滨（江）线的五常到拉法段，长（春）图（们）线的拉法到二道沟段，以及平（四平）齐（齐哈尔）线的双岗到郑家屯（辽源）段。正修建的有郑（家屯）通（辽）线。南满方面：去年夏委攻势解放军收复之各线铁路，经铁路员工努力抢修，到去年十一月份先后通车的有吉（林）沈（阳）线的梅河口到双河镇段，和梅河口到清原段，四（平）梅（河口）线的梅河口到西安段，梅（河口）辑（安）线的鸭园支线（鸭园到临江），总计六百公里。梅辑全线今年二月底可通车。修建的路工绝大部分都是翻身农民，因此虽天寒地冻，地硬得象铁板，他们仍起早搭黑热烈抢修，如南满路工在五十七天内就修建铁道二百七十三公里，大小桥梁三十座，架设电线二百五十公里。他们还自动组织“收集材料委员会”收集各种资材，东安一县就收集道钉五万多颗。今年元旦佳富线，拉滨线等都举行了很隆重的通车典礼，铁路局为酬谢人民和军政机关的帮助，当天乘客完全免费。
