Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) 15th: The Shijiazhuang Democratic Municipal Government has recently issued a proclamation to protect and develop national industry and commerce in the city. The proclamation states: (1) The legitimate property and business of industrialists and merchants shall be protected, and no one shall infringe upon them. The so-called rumors of "equal distribution" of factories and shops are completely ignorant fallacies and conspiracies by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents to deliberately sabotage our industry and commerce. (2) In the event of disputes with factories, workshops, or shops that cannot be resolved independently (whether individual or group), they shall be permitted to file a lawsuit in court and resolve it in accordance with legal procedures. Illegal means such as "transfer," sale, or fines and confiscation shall not be taken privately; violators will be subject to appropriate punishment. (3) Labor-capital relations and owner-partner relations in industry and commerce shall be based on the principles of developing business, prospering the economy, and mutually beneficial cooperation. Contracts shall be concluded through equal consultation (neither party shall coerce the other) and jointly observed, so as to ensure that operators are profitable and workers and shop assistants' lives are effectively guaranteed. Industrial and commercial owners shall not dismiss or abuse workers or shop assistants without reason; workers or shop assistants shall also abide by work regulations, be loyal to their duties, and improve work efficiency. If both parties encounter disputes that cannot be resolved independently, they shall request the government to mediate or adjudicate. Neither party shall take measures that exceed the law. (4) All industrial and commercial owners must not close factories, suspend operations, dismantle machinery, bury materials, or engage in speculation and manipulation of the market without reason. They must quickly resume production and try to open businesses, abide by laws and regulations, and conduct fair transactions to ensure the normal development of industry and commerce and safeguard the livelihood of citizens. (5) Industrial and commercial households with shares of enemy and puppet personnel or hiding enemy and puppet materials shall immediately report to the government for separate handling to effectively protect the legitimate business of private individuals. Those who resist or fail to report will be subject to legal sanctions once discovered.
