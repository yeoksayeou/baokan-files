    The joint cooperative in the sixth district of Yangcheng county inspected its work and found that they had handled things poorly because they had put on official airs in the past. They were afraid that poor people would not be able to repay their debts, so they lent loans to landlords. The originally scheduled repayment date had passed six months ago, but they didn't ask about it. This time, after investigation, it turned out that the borrowing landlord had long been blockaded by our farmers. The cooperative in Ge Village, Shahe, was opened with the fruits of our struggle, but the landlord acted as the manager, enjoying good food and drink. The workers didn't handle this matter, only trying to create more variety, and even opened small flower shops. They said they were run by poor and hired peasants, but the accounts were managed by the landlord, and the main ideas still came from him. Everyone can see how disappointing this is. Before the solar New Year, the Border Region Government issued another 350,000 yuan in winter loans. This money is to be lent to poor people for production. Everyone should check who these loans have been lent to, and not allow landlords to exploit loopholes again.

    （供乡村黑板报、屋顶广播、读报组、工作人员采用）。
    阳城六区区上的联合社检查了一下工作，查出来他们因为过去摆官架子，把事情办坏了。他们怕穷人还不了帐，把贷款借给地主，按原来定的还帐日子已经过了六个月，他们也没问，这次一查，原来借款地主早被咱农民封了门。沙河葛村的合作社是用咱们的斗争果实开的，但地主当掌柜，好吃好喝。工作员没给办这事，光图多闹花样，又让开小花坊。明里说叫贫雇办，但帐又是地主管，主要还是人家出主意。大家看这事该有多败兴。阳历年前，边区政府又发了三十五万万元冬季贷款，这些钱都是要借给穷人闹生产的，大家都要查查这批钱借给了谁，不能再让地主钻空子。
