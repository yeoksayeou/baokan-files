　　Zuoquan's Hired and Poor Discuss Land Redistribution
　　Peasants Still Have Misunderstandings, Widespread Education Urgently Needed
　　[Our Newspaper's News] After hearing about the Land Law Outline, the vast number of poor and hired peasants in the first, second, third, fifth, and seventh districts of Zuoquan County were very excited. In particular, they expressed enthusiastic support for the article stipulating that the peasant association and the poor peasant leagues should be in charge of affairs. Many people said, "Those cadres only talk nicely, but we don't know if they can really do it. Now we can be masters of our own affairs, so we are safe." A poor hired peasant from Cheshangpu in the seventh district said, "Chairman Mao's words are really good. We should be given land first in the redistribution and landlords must be thoroughly overthrown before they can be given a share." Guo Xiangliang, a hired peasant from Xiafenghou Village in the first district, said, "I have always wanted to cultivate a good piece of land, but I have never cultivated even an inch in my lifetime. Now that it is to be evenly distributed, and the fertile land is to be used to compensate the barren land, it should be my turn to cultivate a good piece of land." Zhao Xiaosan said, "I was so happy when I heard about the Outline. When we turned over last year, we didn't get a good piece of land. The good land was still cultivated by the rich peasants. After the redistribution, I can get a good piece of land." Wang Yulun said, "My land is only enough for one person to cultivate. I have always wanted to marry a wife, but I don't dare to marry without anything. This time, with the redistribution, each person will get a larger share, so there is a way." The poor hired peasants in Liangjia Village initially couldn't understand why landlords should be given a share. Many people said, "The landlord in our village still cultivates the good land and lives in a building, while we are still poor. What do we have to give him?" Later, after it was made clear that the landlords would be thoroughly overthrown first and then given a share, they agreed. A young female village head of a poor hired peasant from Gaojiajing in the fifth district said, "In the past, our poor people would dig the landlord's barren slopes, and he wouldn't allow it. Now we're giving him a share, which is really cheap for him. But everyone should understand that the equal distribution of land is a matter for us poor and hired peasants, and has nothing to do with the landlords."
　　However, there are many misunderstandings and distortions of the Land Law that have been discovered in various districts, which are worth noting: First, wealthy middle peasants are only affected by their land, not their movable property. Many villages have not clearly publicized this point, causing anxiety among the middle peasants. Winter production in Lichang Village in the first district has come to a standstill. Cadres and middle peasants are eating and drinking lavishly, wasting a lot. Six sheep were killed in two days in Duanyu Village. Women in Zhangba Village in the third district have stopped spinning, and men are no longer engaged in transportation. Second, the equal distribution of land is misunderstood as "communism." As a result, some old middle peasants have developed a fear of "partnership." The middle peasants in Kutidi and six other villages in the first district said, "Equal distribution is communism. It's better to live a collective life together. Anyway, nothing belongs to anyone, and everything must be divided equally." Third, no attention has been paid to the landlords taking advantage of loopholes to spread rumors. For example, Li Jiliang, a landlord in Fuyu Village in the first district, said, "Is this time's equal distribution of land because the past struggles were wrong?" After hearing the Land Law Outline, the landlord of Qinghe Shop actually sang a local opera on the street and said, "This is nothing to be afraid of, it's getting better!" Fourth, some cadres who have taken too many fruits have begun to disperse and sell their property secretly. For example, the director of the Wang Peasant Association closed the flour mill and slaughtered six pigs, and the political director sold forty catties of hemp. (Baoguo)

　　左权雇贫谈平分土地
  　农民仍有误解急需普遍教育
    【本报消息】左权一、二、三、五、七各区广大贫雇农民听到土地法大纲后，都非常兴奋，特别是对农民大会和贫农团要掌权办事一条，更表示热烈拥护。许多人说：“那些干部光说得好，也不知道能不能真作，现在我们自己可以当家作主，那就保住险了。”七区车上铺一贫雇说：“毛主席的话真好，平分先给咱分上，把地主彻底斗垮了，然后才能够给他分一份。”一区下丰堠村雇贫郭祥良说：“咱老想种一亩好地，可是想了几辈子没种上一分，现在要平分，要抽肥补瘦，可该轮到我种一亩好地了。”赵小三说：“我听了大纲高兴得可厉害哩，去年翻身咱没有分上一块好地，好地还是让富农他们种着。平分一下来，咱可以换块好地了。”王玉伦说：“咱地只够一个人种，年年想娶个老婆，没东西又不敢娶，这回平分，一口人的要多分些，可就有了办法了。”梁家庄贫雇开始对给地主一份思想上打不通，许多人说：“俺村地主还是种的好地，住的楼房，咱穷还是穷，拿啥去给人家分呀！”后来闹清楚是先把地主彻底斗垮，再分给他一份，就同意了。五区高家井贫雇青年女村长说：“咱们穷人过去刨地主些荒坡，他都不让，现在咱们也给他分一份，实在够便宜他了。不过大家要闹清楚，平分土地是咱贫雇的事，不与地主一字相干。”
    但是各区已发现不少对土地法误解和曲解的现象值得注意：第一、富裕中农只动土地不动浮财。不少村因为没有明确宣传这一点，致引起中农不安，一区里长村冬季生产都停顿了，干部和中农大吃二喝，浪费的很厉害。段峪村两天杀了六只羊。三区丈八村妇女已不纺花了，男人也不搞运输了。第二、把平分土地误解成“共产”。因此有些老中农产生了怕“合伙”思想，一区库堤等六村中农说：“平分就是共产呀，不如合伙了过集体生活，反正东西谁也不是谁的，都得共同平分。”第三、没有注意地主钻空子造谣。如一区扶峪村地主李计良说：“这次平分土地呀，不是过去斗争得不对了吧！”清河店地主听了土地法大纲，竟在大街上唱梆子腔。并说：“这可不怕了，快好呀！”第四、有些多占果实的干部，已开始分散偷卖财产。如果王农会主任把粉坊停闭，杀了六口猪，政治主任卖了四十斤麻。（保国）
