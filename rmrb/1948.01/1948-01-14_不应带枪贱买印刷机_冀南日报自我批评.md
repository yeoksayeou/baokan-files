　　“Should Not Have Brought Guns to Cheaply Buy a Printing Press”
  　Ji'nan Daily Self-Criticism
    [Ji'nan News] The Ji'nan Daily has made a public self-criticism regarding the cheap purchase of a printing press in Shijiazhuang. The self-criticism first described the circumstances of the cheap purchase of the printing press (completely consistent with what was published in this newspaper on the 6th of this month). It then stated that the Propaganda Department of the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Central Bureau believed that this matter was "grabbing a handful" in a newly liberated city, harming the people, and harming industrial and commercial interests. It immediately sent a telegram to the District Party Committee, instructing us to conduct a strict examination of this matter. After our self-examination, it was indeed as the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau pointed out: it was "grabbing a handful" in a newly liberated city, only caring about ourselves, harming the people, and harming industrial and commercial interests. After Shimen was liberated, we sent three purchasing agents to buy lead type, wanting to take advantage of "cheap" prices. We didn't realize that this kind of "cheap" price arose from the newly liberated merchants having been deceived by enemy propaganda in the past and not understanding us. Taking advantage of their "cheap" prices is harming the interests of the people. We originally intended to only buy lead type, but because it was not sold separately, we bought the machines and other items together. We didn't realize that doing so violated our Party's policy of protecting national industry and commerce and promoting the prosperity of the city. Our starting point was a simple "small-group interest." The ideological root of this starting point is, on the one hand, the remnants of the erroneous thinking from the guerrilla war period of treating large cities as colonies and grabbing a handful; and on the other hand, the consistent opposition of the interests of the organization to the interests of the masses, only caring about the organization and not caring about the masses, making the masses obey the organization, and acting independently from the overall interests of the people and the Party's policies. These are also reflections of a kind of exploitative and sectarian thinking in our specific work. In addition, in the thinking and attitude of our purchasing agents, they were also wielding the so-called "official" prestige, not caring whether others truly wanted to sell or not, feeling happy as long as they got it into their own hands. Furthermore, because they were wearing military uniforms and carrying guns, they went to buy it twice, which further increased Chang Zhanggui's panic and suspicion, and fueled his idea of selling at a cheap price. We completely accept the education and criticism of us from the New Shimen Daily and the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau. We specially publish our mistakes in the newspaper, completely agree with the measures of the Materials Management Committee, and educate all comrades in the newspaper office, so that similar mistakes do not happen again.

　　“不应带枪贱买印刷机”
  　冀南日报自我批评
    【冀南消息】冀南日报对于在石家庄贱买印刷机的事情，作了公开检讨；检讨首先叙述了贱买印刷机的经过情形（与本月六日本报所载完全相符），接着说晋冀鲁豫中央局宣传部认为这件事是到新解放城市抓一把，损害人民，损害工商业利益，立即打电报给区党委，让我们就这件事作严格检查。经过我们检讨，确如中央局宣传部所指，是到新解放城市里抓一把，光顾自己，损害人民，损害工商业利益。当石门解放后，我们就派了三个采购员去买铅字，想乘机拣“便宜”，没认识这种“便宜”是新解放的商人过去受了敌人的欺骗宣传，对我们不了解的情况下产生的。拣他们的“便宜”就是损害人民利益。去时打算只买铅字，因为不单卖，就连机器等一同买了。没认识这样做就违背了我党保护民族工商业和繁荣城市的方针。我们的出发点是单纯的“小本位利益”，这种出发点的思想根源一方面是游击战争时期，把大城市当作殖民地，乱抓一把的错误思想残余，再一方面是一贯的把机关利益与群众利益相对立，只为机关，不顾群众，叫群众服从机关，向人民整体利益与党的政策闹独立性。这些也是一种剥削思想及宗派思想在我们具体工作上的反映。另外在我们采购员同志的思想及态度上，也是挟持着所谓“公家”的威风，不管别人真愿卖假愿卖，只要拿到自己手里就痛快。又由于穿着军装，带着枪，连着两次去买，这样就更增加了常掌柜的恐慌和怀疑，助长了他贱价卖出的想法。我们完全接受新石门日报及中央局宣传部对我们的教育和批评，特在报上公开发表我们的错误，完全同意物资管理委员会的办法，并在报社内教育全体同志，不再发生类似的错误。
