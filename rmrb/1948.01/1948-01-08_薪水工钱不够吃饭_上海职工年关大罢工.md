Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: According to various sources, a massive year-end labor strike has erupted in Shanghai. The 12,000 workers of the British American Tobacco Company's Yizhong Cigarette Factory began a strike on the 30th of last month. Customs employees also began a work slowdown and hunger strike on the same day, and sent representatives to petition. Several thousand workers from another twelve factories are also conducting "strike-slowdowns." All employees are unanimously demanding improved treatment and a year-end bonus equal to more than two months' salary, rejecting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities' approval of only one month's bonus paid in two installments. According to the workers, "Our salaries are not enough to feed us, so we have no choice but to slow down our work." Customs employees also said, "Our salaries are not enough to buy adequate food, so we cannot be expected to work 'adequately'." The Chiang Kai-shek Shanghai Municipal Government announced at the end of the new calendar year that the December cost of living index for workers was 68,200 times the base level, and for employees 58,600 times, far less than half of the actual price index of 145,000 times. The news further incited extreme public outrage among the workers. In other news: Pilots and sailors in Tianjin began a strike on the 28th of last month to protest the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's shooting at merchant ships entering the port with rifles and machine guns on the 26th, and the indiscriminate arrest of a chief mate and two crew members. Currently, shipping in Tianjin port is paralyzed.

　　薪水工钱不够吃饭
  　上海职工年关大罢工
    【新华社陕北四日电】据各方消息：上海已发生巨大年关工潮。英美烟草公司之颐中烟厂一万二千工人，于上月三十日起开始罢工。海关职员亦于同日起怠工并绝食，并派代表请愿。另有十二个工厂的数千工人，亦正在进行“罢怠”。职工们均一致要求改善待遇，及发给等于两个月以上工资的年赏，拒绝蒋匪当局所批准的只发一个月年赏分两期付款。据工人们说：“薪水不够我们吃饱饭，我们不得不放慢工作”。海关职员也说：“薪水不够买适当的粮食，因此就不能希望我们‘适当地’工作”。据蒋匪沪市政府于新历年底宣布十二月份生活费指数工人为六万八千二百倍；职员为五万八千六百倍，远不及实际物价指数十四万五千倍之二分之一。此消息传出后，更激起工人们的极度公愤。另息：天津领港及水手，于上月二十八日开始罢工，抗议蒋匪军于二十六日以步枪、机枪射击进港商轮，及滥肆逮捕大副及两船员。现天津港口船运已陷于麻痹状态。
