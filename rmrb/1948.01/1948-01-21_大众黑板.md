Commander Liu led a large army south and established a base area in the Dabie Mountains, where he inflicted heavy defeats on the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the area bordering Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui. From late August to late December in the Gregorian calendar, in four months they captured alive, killed, or wounded more than 50,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops, and captured 33 county towns. After the Gregorian New Year, they captured Sui County and Yun County west of Hankou, eliminating more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops. The Jianghan Military Region, which our New Fourth Army opened up during the Anti-Japanese War, has been restored, and twelve new democratic county governments have been established. The peasants in this area are also distributing land and eliminating feudalism. In the southwest corner of Henan Province, Deng County was recently captured, destroying the old nests of the landlords' forces in that area and eliminating more than 8,000 "security guards" who protected the landlords. This lifted a large stone slab off the peasants in that large area.

The armies led by General Chen Yi and General Chen Geng squeezed out the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the Pinghan Railway from the east and west sides before the Lunar New Year. On New Year's Day in the Gregorian calendar, Chiang Kai-shek troops sneaked into Xuchang City again, but were driven out by our army again four or five days later. Linru City west of Pinghan Road has also been taken back into our hands. In the four months before the end of the Lunar New Year, the army led by General Chen Geng captured alive, killed, or wounded more than 56,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops and captured 36 county towns. They have now gained a firm foothold in the Funiu Mountains and have established eight commissioner's offices and more than forty democratic county governments, and the masses are also distributing land and turning over a new leaf. The army led by General Chen Yi eliminated more than 30,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops and captured 18 county towns in the month before the end of the Gregorian calendar. Kaifeng, the provincial capital of Henan, has been surrounded by us on all sides and has become a white spot.

    刘司令员带领大军打到南边去以后，在大别山建立了块根据地，就在这湖南、湖北、安徽交界地方把蒋匪军打得落花流水。从阳历八月底到十二月底，四个月里一共活捉、打死、打伤蒋匪五万多人，打下来三十三座县城。过来阳历年以后，又在汉口西边打下了随县、郧县，又把蒋匪消灭了一千多人。抗日时期咱新四军开辟的江汉军区已经恢复，新成立了十二个民主县政府，这地面上的农民也正在平分土地，消灭封建。在河南省西南角，前几天又打下邓县，捣了那一片地方上地主队伍的老窝，消灭了给地主保镖的“保安团”八千多人。给那一大片地方的农民掀掉了一块大石板。
    陈毅将军和陈赓将军带的军队，阴历年前从东西两面把平汉铁路的蒋匪挤掉。过阳历年那一天，蒋匪又窜进许昌城，过了四五天就又叫咱们军队赶跑啦。平汉路西的临汝城也又拿到了咱手里。阴历年年底以前那四个月里，陈赓将军带的军队一共活捉、打死、打伤蒋匪五万六千多，打下三十六座县城。眼下已经在伏牛山站稳脚跟，成立了八个专员公署、四十多个民主县政府，群众也都正在分地翻身。陈毅将军带的军队阳历年底以前一个月就消灭蒋匪三万多，打下县城十八座。蒋匪河南省城开封已经叫咱四面包围起来，成了个白点子。
