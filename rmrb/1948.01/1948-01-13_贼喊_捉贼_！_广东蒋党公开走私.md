Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: A dispatch from Guangzhou: Smuggling in Guangdong is becoming increasingly rampant. According to statistics, the value of smuggled goods seized by the Guangdong Customs in 1946 alone amounted to over 10 billion yuan. In the six months from May to October 1947, the value of seized smuggled goods had already exceeded 20 billion yuan. The market in Guangzhou is now flooded with smuggled goods. In addition to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and coastal waterways, smuggling routes also include air smuggling. Nanpeng Island, under the jurisdiction of Yangjiang County, and Dapeng Bay, under the jurisdiction of Bao'an County, are major bases for smuggling tungsten ore. It is said that smuggling tungsten ore from Guangzhou to Hong Kong can yield a profit of 100%. Large-scale smuggling is different from sporadic smuggling by those who make a living from it. In recent years, smuggling organizations in Guangdong, as is well known, are led by the bureaucratic capital groups of the Chiang government. They are all armed escorts, or they bribe customs officials, and they proceed by water, land, and air. For example, the "tax-free sugar" smuggled and imported by the Sino-American Industrial Company jointly run by Soong Mei-ling and Chennault a couple of months ago is already a public matter. Smuggling by the Executive Headquarters' ships is also an open secret. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit government's daily calls for "strengthening anti-smuggling" have no impact on these wealthy and powerful smuggling groups. They will continue to make fortunes as before, and smuggling will become their exclusive business.

　　贼喊“捉贼”！
  　广东蒋党公开走私
    【新华社陕北六日电】广州通讯：广东走私日益猖獗，据统计，一九四六年一年粤海关缉获的私货约达一百亿元以上，而一九四七年五月至十月六个月中，缉获私货价值已有二百余亿元，现广州市上充满私货。走私路线除广九路和沿海水路以外，还有空中走私。在阳江县属的南鹏岛和宝安县属的大鹏湾则为钨矿走私的大本营，据说由广州私运钨矿至香港可获利一倍，大规模的走私是与以走私养活家的零星走私者不同的。年来的广东走私机构，如众所周知，是由蒋政府的官僚资本集团所领导，都是武装护运，或通过对关卡人员的贿买，由水、陆、空三路并进。如两三个月以前宋美龄与陈纳德合办的中美实业公司走私进口的“无税糖”已是公开的事。行总船只走私也是公开的秘密。蒋匪政府终日所叫喊的“加强缉私”，对这些有钱有势走私集团，是丝毫没有影响的，他们将如以往一样照旧发财下去，而且走私将成为他们的独占生意。
