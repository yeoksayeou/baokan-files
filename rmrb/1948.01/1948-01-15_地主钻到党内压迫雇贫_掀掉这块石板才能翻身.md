Landlords Infiltrate the Party to Oppress Hired and Poor Peasants
  Overthrowing This Slab is the Only Way to Turn Things Around
[Our Dispatch] A large portion of us poor people haven't thoroughly turned things around, and that's because we have a big slab weighing us down. Some landlords and rich peasants have infiltrated the Communist Party, become leaders of branches, shielding landlords, embezzling fruits of victory, and committing all kinds of evil. Some Party members who came from peasant backgrounds have been influenced by landlords and have forgotten their roots. These bad Party members are "a swarm of bees," causing trouble so that even after more than a year of land reform, we still lack clothing and food and dare not speak out.

In Cixian County's Beiguo Village, there were seven Party members, four of whom were landlords. Although three were purged during rent and interest reduction, the landlords' power in the branch was not eliminated. Later, the number of Party members increased to ten (two poor peasants, five middle peasants, one landlord, and one rich peasant). Influenced by the 50-year-old clan struggle of landlords in the village, the branch was also divided into two factions, each protecting their landlord backers. When struggling against the landlord Du Laoshou of the western faction, the western faction members were dissatisfied and didn't move, while the eastern faction members were very "active." When the western faction struggled against the eastern faction's landlord, Sun Chengxian, the chairman of the peasant association summoned the eastern faction members and said, "Chengxian is one of our own, we must find a way to help him." So he was shielded and not struggled against. In Cixian County's Tianzhuang, a landlord infiltrated the branch and became the anti-deserter director. In the land reform, he not only shielded his own family but also his relatives. He himself was even allocated 48 mu of land and eight rooms. Seven bankrupt landlords and eleven rich peasants infiltrated this branch during the land reform. The power of the branch in Cixian County's Donggufuo Village was also controlled by landlords. The large landlord Zhang Fengge owned more than 1,300 mu of land before he divided his family. During the land reform, he "donated" more than 80 mu, and the branch said he was "enlightened." The bully Li Weijin, who had forced people to death, was related to the branch secretary, and he was only lightly struggled against and then it was over.

Li Mabao, a Party member in Wuxiang's Shuxin Village, became a big bully in the village. Shi Minglin, a dirt-poor, honorably discharged soldier who came from a shepherding background, was at odds with Li Mabao. He was allocated two rooms, but then they were taken away. However, Li Mabao's brother-in-law came to Shuxin from the first district, without any formal procedures, but was allocated a string of the best brick courtyards. Li Mabao, Zhao Hujiang, Liu Fuchang, Wang Zhenbiao, and other four major cadres took the lead in eating and drinking extravagantly when calculating the fruits of victory, consuming a total of 160,000 yuan. They came up with a new trick called "handling fees," using the excuse of "handling fees" to seize a portion when the masses were distributing the fruits of victory. An old man was allocated a table, a wooden board, and a piece of clothing. The wooden board was taken by the cadres for official use, and the table was taken by the village head Liu Fuchang, saying it was a "handling fee." The old man only received the piece of clothing. The poor peasant Chen Guoxing was allocated a big tree, and Li Mabao repeatedly sent people to buy it, but Guoxing refused to sell. Li Mabao then "mobilized" the "masses" to struggle against Guoxing, accusing him of embezzling as a representative. This caused Guoxing to be ruined. During the land reform, these "four major cadres" embezzled fruits of victory worth more than 700,000 yuan (excluding houses and land), accounting for 80% of the total fruits of victory. The old poor peasant Wang Jinmu liked to speak his mind and sometimes criticized the cadres. Li Mabao and his cohorts were very dissatisfied with him. During the land reform, Jinmu calculated his wages with the landlord, but the cadres forced Jinmu to return them to the landlord.

In Shexian County's Huaigeta Village, the branch secretary and peasant association chairman Dong Yongkuan, the public security officer Dong Fujiang, the civil education director Dong Luxiu, and the peasant association propagandist Dong Guanglu were all landlords. The village head Dong Jianxiang was a rich peasant. They controlled all the power in the village, embezzled the fruits of victory, and arbitrarily beat the masses. The masses gnashed their teeth at them, calling them life-threatening demons. The landlords who had personal grudges with them were struggled against, but Dong Yicheng, who was related to them, was classified as a middle peasant and not struggled against at all.

The Erlongmiao branch in Linxian County was ruled by middle peasants. The middle peasant Chen Wenxing was the village head and also the branch secretary. In the branch, there were fifteen people: three dirt-poor peasants, six poor peasants, one lower-middle peasant, four middle peasants, and one rich peasant. The ones with the most power were the middle peasants who had connections with landlords and rich peasants. Chen Wenxing led the struggle, saying that the landlords' remaining houses should be "enough to live in" and the remaining land should be "enough to cultivate." When the masses wanted to beat the landlord, Chen Wenxing said, "It's getting late, let's adjourn the meeting!" The masses said that the struggle against the landlord Wang Fushan was not thorough enough. Chen Wenxing said that Wang Fushan had been robbed by bandits once and lost a lot of things. His father had silver dollars, died of a sudden illness, and Wang Fushan didn't know where the silver dollars were. Wang Fushan was a gambler and lost a lot of family property. When the masses went to Wang Fushan's house to move things during the struggle, Chen Wenxing said that you could only take one of two things, but if there was only one, you couldn't take it. When struggling against the feudal rich peasant Yan Jingyun, the women wanted to divide the spinning wheels and looms, but Chen Wenxing said, "They still need to produce, let's quickly send them back."

Our Opinion
This slab must be overthrown today. If this slab is not overthrown, we poor people cannot thoroughly defeat the landlords, we will have no food to eat, no clothes to wear, no houses to live in, and we cannot live a happy life with our wives and children. The Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China's Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region has issued a letter to Party members to help us overthrow this slab. To overthrow this slab, we poor people must unite, not be afraid, not worry about face, criticize those bad elements who should be criticized, punish those who should be punished, eliminate the landlords and rich peasants who resolutely oppose us, and transform those who can still work for us. The world is created by us. As long as we all work together with one heart, we are sure to win.

Those Party member cadres who have done bad things, you must know: your behavior is a serious mistake, a crime. Today, you should honestly listen to the people's judgment, be expelled if you should be expelled, and be punished if you should be punished. If you are not aware of this at this time, do not act in accordance with the Land Law, and continue to commit crimes, you will be severely punished by the Party and the people. As long as you stand on the side of the Party and the people, sincerely accept criticism and punishment, resolutely correct your mistakes, bow your heads to the people, and declare that you will obey the people and the Party in the future, the people and the Party still want you, and will treat you warmly, help you correct your mistakes, and continue to be hired laborers for the people.

　　地主钻到党内压迫雇贫
  　掀掉这块石板才能翻身
    【本报消息】咱们穷人当中有好大一部分没有彻底翻身，就是因为咱们身上有一块大石板。有些地主、富农钻进共产党内，当了支部的领头人，包庇地主，贪污果实，无恶不作。有些农民出身的党员受了地主的影响，也忘了本。这些坏党员是“一窝蜂”，闹得土地改革进行了一年多，咱们仍然少衣缺食，不敢说话。
    磁县北郭村七个党员，里面有四个地主。减租减息中虽然清洗了三个，但地主在支部中的权力并没有打掉。以后党员成了十个（两个贫农、五个中农、一个地主、一个富农），受村中五十年来地主宗派斗争的影响，支部也分成两个宗派，各保各的地主后台。斗争西派地主杜老寿时，西派党员不满不动，东派的党员很“积极”。西派斗争东派地主孙成先时，农会主任召集东派的人说：“成先好坏是自己的人，我们要给他想办法。”于是包庇下来没有斗。磁县田庄地主钻入支部，当了抗勤主任，在土地改革中不但包庇了他自己的家庭，还包庇了本家。他自己还分了四十八亩地、八间房子。有七个破产地主、十一个富农在土地改革中钻进了这个支部。磁县东古佛村支部的大权也操在地主手中，大地主张丰格没分家前占有土地一千三百多亩，在土地改革中“献”了八十多亩，支部就说他“开明”。曾逼死过人命的恶霸李维金和支部书记是本家，只轻轻的斗争了一下就算完事。
    武乡树辛村党员李马保成了村里的大恶霸。放羊出身的赤贫、荣誉军人石明林和李马保不对，分了两间房子，以后又不给了。但是李马保的大舅子从一区到了树辛，没有什么正式手续，却分了一串最好的砖院。李马保、赵虎江、刘富昌、王振标等四大干部在算果实帐时领头大吃大喝，一共吃了十六万元。他们想出一种“经手费”的新花样，群众分果实时，他们借口“经手费”要霸占一部分。一个老人分到一张桌子、一块木板、一件衣服，木板被干部挂牌用了，桌子被村长刘富昌拿走了，说是“经手费”。这个老人就只得到了一件衣服。贫农陈国兴分到一棵大树，李马保三番五次着人去买，国兴不卖。李马保就“发动”“群众”斗争国兴，说他当代表贪污了。闹得国兴倾家荡产。在土地改革中，这“四大干部”贪污了果实价值七十多万（不算房屋和土地），占全部果实百分之八十。贫农王金木老汉爱说直理，有时也批评干部。李马保们对他很不满意，土地改革中金木向地主算出工资，干部们又强迫金木给地主退了回去。
    涉县槐圪塔村的支部书记兼农会主任董永宽、公安员董福江、民教主任董禄秀、农会宣传董光禄都是地主，村长董建香是富农，他们掌握全村大权，贪污果实，随意吊打群众，群众对他们咬牙切齿，称他们为要命阎王。和他们有私仇的地主就斗争了，和他们有关系的董义成被他们划成中农，根本没有斗争。
    林县二龙庙支部是中农当政。中农陈文兴是村长，又是支部书记。支部里十五个人，三个赤贫，六个贫农，一个下中农，四个中农，一个富农，顶有权力的是和地主富农有拉扯的中农。陈文兴领导斗争，给地主留的房子要“够住”，留的地要“够种”。群众要打地主时，陈文兴说：“天不早了，散会吧！”群众说地主王甫山斗争的不彻底，陈文兴说王甫山被土匪抢过一次，损失东西很多。他爹有现洋，得急病死了，王甫山不知道现洋在什么地方。王甫山好赌，输的家业不少。斗争时群众到王甫山家搬东西，陈文兴说有两样才能拿一样，有一样的不能拿。斗争封建富农阎景云时，妇女们要分纺花车、织布机，陈文兴说：“人家还要生产啦，快给人家送回去吧。”
    　　　　我们的意见
    这块石板，今天是非掀掉不可了，不掀掉这块石板，咱们穷人就不能彻底搞垮地主，就没有饭吃，没有衣穿，没有房住，就不能和老婆孩子在一起过痛快的日子。中国共产党晋冀鲁豫中央局发表了告党员书，就是为了帮助咱们掀掉这块石板。要掀掉这块石板，就得咱们穷人团结起来，不要害怕，不讲面子，对这些坏分子该批评的批评，该惩治的惩治，去掉坚决反对咱们的地主富农，改造还能给咱们办事的人。世界是咱们创造的，只要咱们大家一心的干，保险能得到胜利。
    这些作了坏事的党员干部，你们要知道：你们的行为是严重的错误，是犯了罪的。今天应该老老实实的听从人民的处理，该开除的开除，该处分的处分。如果在这时候还不觉悟，不按土地法办事，继续犯罪，就要受到党和人民的严厉制裁。你们只要站在党和人民立场上，诚恳的接受批评处分，坚决的改正错误，向人民低头，声明今后服从人民服从党，人民和党还是要你们的，并热情相待，帮助你们改正错误，继续当人民的长工。
