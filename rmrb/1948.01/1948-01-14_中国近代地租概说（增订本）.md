　　An Overview of Land Rent in Modern China (Revised Edition)
    By Chen Boda
    This is part of the manuscript "Modern Chinese Agriculture and the Various Classes in Chinese Rural Areas" written by Comrade Chen Boda, temporarily published for everyone's reference.
    Land rent is the most cruel and barbaric way for the feudal class to exploit peasants. Understanding its full content will help us understand why poor peasants were exploited to the point of "being stripped to the bone," living lives that were simply not humanly possible! It will also help us further understand why land reform is the fundamental task of the Chinese revolution!
    Chapter Five of this book cites many materials to illustrate the situation of land rent plunder in the Kuomintang-controlled areas during the war—the four major families of big landlords, big compradors, and big bureaucratic groups used extremely primitive, extremely barbaric, and extremely cruel methods to exploit peasants and increase their wealth, making many peasants reach the final limit of complete intolerance. Reading this chapter can deepen our understanding of how urgently we need to undertake the task of liberating China, and it also deepens our understanding of one of the reasons for the rapid arrival of the national revolutionary upsurge.

　　中国近代地租概说（增订本）
    陈伯达著
    这是陈伯达同志写作中的“近代中国农业与中国农村各阶级”的一部分稿子，暂先发表出来，供大家参考。
    地租，是封建阶级一种剥削农民最残酷、最野蛮的方式，了解了它的全部内容，便了解了贫苦农民为什么会被剥削得“剥肌见髓”，过着简直不是人类所能过的生活！也便能进一步的了解，为什么土地改革是中国革命的基本任务！
    本书第五章，更引证了许多材料，说明战时蒋介石统治区地租掠夺的情况，——大地主、大买办、大官僚集团的四大家族，用了极原始、极野蛮、极残酷的方法，来剥削农民，增加自己的财富；使得许多农民已到了完全不能忍受的最后限度。读了这一章，可使我们更深的认识解放中国的任务，是那样迫切的要我们担负起来，也使我们更深的认识全国革命高潮，目前迅速到来的一个原因。
