　　Active Combat Assists Land Reform
  　A Certain Brigade Receives Commendation from Commanders Liu and Deng Through Circular Order
    [Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 20th] Commanders Liu, Deng, Zhang and others issued a circular order commending a certain brigade of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army for its war achievements and land reform work, and awarded it a major merit. The unit actively suppressed bandits in the Ying Shan area and helped complete land reform in most of the area north of its mountains. In the battle to capture Guangji County, it also created a victory by independently annihilating the regimental direct subordinate units and two battalions of the 6th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade of the 203rd Division of the Kuomintang Youth Army, totaling 1,050 men. The circular pointed out that the brigade's active combat and assistance in carrying out land reform work is of great significance for crushing the so-called "offensive" of the Kuomintang bandits.
