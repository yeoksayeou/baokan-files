"I want to fight back to Taiwan!"
　　An Autobiography of Industrial Worker Zeng Fuyuan
　　Recorded by Bai Hua
　　My name is Zeng Fuyuan, and I used to be an industrial worker in a sugar factory. There are three major ethnic groups in Taiwan: the Gaoshan people, who are the largest and oldest; the Guangdong people; and the Fujian people. I am a Guangdong person from Hsinchu County.
　　My family had no fields, no land, and no house. When I was three years old, my mother died from overwork because we didn't have money for medicine. When I was eleven, the Japanese devils levied taxes and fees, and my father, working alone, couldn't make a living. The landlord forced my older sister away. After a few months, my father also coughed up blood from exhaustion. He wanted to eat something, but we had no money to buy anything. Day after day, he just dragged on until he breathed his last. I heard him say a few words: "The wealthy landlord has taken your sister to use her like livestock. I'm so sick that I'm dying and can't even afford a coffin. Our family has been looked down upon for generations. You must be successful, you must..."
　　I was in elementary school at the time. I knew how my father had scrimped and saved to send me to school on a half-empty stomach. The more resentful I felt, the more I thought: "The police are the most powerful! In the future, I'm going to take the police academy entrance exams. After graduating, I'll let my sister live a good life, and kill a few landlords and rich men to avenge my parents!"
　　At the time, being young, poorly educated, and unqualified was one thing, but we didn't even have anything to eat. What could I do? Life became increasingly difficult. We lived on sweet potatoes with salt water. On top of that, the Japanese devils wanted taxes, and if we couldn't pay, they would fine us, beat us, and curse us. As a result, a long strip of paper sealed our door.
　　Year after year passed with difficulty. When I turned fourteen, the Japanese devils conscripted my older brother to be a military laborer in Southeast Asia. Later, he worked in a refreshment shop, working fourteen hours a day for only forty cents. My brother couldn't take care of himself, let alone me. I couldn't just drink the northwest wind on an empty stomach! So I had to go to work as a child laborer in the sugar factory, working twelve hours a day. I was so tired that I often fainted. Looking around, wanting to rest for a while, "Bakayarō!" "Bang!" The Japanese supervisor, holding a short wooden stick, beat and scolded me: "You coolie devils! Earning fifty cents a day, not working hard, tearing, tearing!" — It scared the soul right out of me!
　　"Okay! I'll earn money later, study hard, and take the police academy exams!" At the time, while being beaten, I still wanted to become a police officer to take revenge. — I didn't know that the police were the running dogs of the Japanese devils and the rich men; becoming a police officer would only increase the claws of those cronies, unable to save my poor family and my fate of being beaten and abused. …
　　The factory was damp and stuffy. I developed sores on my head, but they wouldn't give me medical treatment. Labor, labor, I developed sores, pus flowed all over my body, and they let me go. After my friends helped me heal, the factory owner deducted the wages for the past few dozen days, even taking away my original earnings. …
　　These were all minor matters. The dangerous thing was when I was seventeen — during the hot days of 1944 and 1945, American planes desperately bombed Taiwan. I was assigned to repair the airport. People on the ground ran around in chaos, planes buzzed overhead, and bombs dropped non-stop with a deafening roar. We wanted to run, but the Japanese devils' machine guns nearby had already been set up. They couldn't hit the American planes, so like mad dogs, they just shouted and strafed us workers. A fellow worker fell! Then a second, a third, all the way to dozens. …
　　I just lay on the ground, praying to the gods to protect us suffering workers. …
　　The planes passed, and the strafing stopped. Looking around, dozens of people had died! — Deceived by the Japanese devils in the past, I thought that we should "serve the Emperor loyally, and death is predetermined!" But now I think: Weren't these dead people all our class brothers, sacrificed in the Japanese fascists' war? Capitalists and landlords enjoyed themselves in comfort, not coming to repair the airport, not getting killed; thinking about it, what "Emperor" and "Gods" aren't all deceiving us workers?! Rich men and Japanese devils all treat us as less than human, calling us to be their cannon fodder. …
　　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★
　　In October of the same year, the Kuomintang army came to Taiwan. We all thought: The "Central Army" has come and will definitely help us! We will definitely not live a hard life again! From then on, we saw the blue sky — I arrived in my own motherland.
　　But what was the reality? The Kuomintang army brought even more ferocious burning, killing, raping, and plundering than the Japanese devils. Receiving officials flew everywhere, factories closed down, food was scarce, stores closed, and people were panicking. And incidents of swindling money, conscripting soldiers, raping, and killing became more and more frequent.
　　"Those who wish to enlist will receive a monthly salary of three thousand yuan, complete equality; you can learn boxing and culture, and be allowed to go home once every two weeks; at most two years, those who wish to continue can continue, those who do not wish to can retire to their fields or engage in other professions. …"
　　— What a beautiful "dignified" facade of the Kuomintang army's "recruiting"! How many Taiwanese youths were deceived! …
　　I was an unemployed sugar worker, making sugar for others but suffering all my life. If I had known that the factory closures and our workers' lack of food were caused by this group of devils, I would rather have died than enlisted! And if I had known that the "disaster army" inside was so cruel to me, starving me, beating me, deceiving me left and right, and actually sending me to the civil war battlefield in North China to be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek, to slaughter our own class brothers, I, my conscience! My conscience! I would have jumped into the sea or escaped early or fought them!
　　I... knew nothing; we only complained about our bad luck, or said a few words: "The dog (Japan) is gone, and the pig (Chiang Kai-shek) has come, — the dog can still guard the door, what's the use of the pig?" to vent the anger in our chests. I... we only knew that we were not living a human life. Taiwan, poor and rich Taiwan, was still ruled by beasts! Old people shed tears, sighing and swallowing their voices; poor young people were livestock in the past, and are still cattle and horses today; young girls, who were originally beautiful, are now covered with endless pain and shame. According to our elders, we haven't seen the sun or light for a long time. "Motherland!" "Motherland!" The Kuomintang army "Motherland" that we enthusiastically celebrated and welcomed with tears! What they gave us was to lead us further into darkness, disaster, pain, hunger, and death!
　　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★
　　A great stroke of luck! This day last year — January 9th, the day of the major battle on the outskirts of Jining and Yutai; Heaven has eyes, I... we were finally liberated by the Communist People's Liberation Army!
　　"Liberated soldier," I used to feel sad when I heard about it; "Liberated over!" Isn't that just being captured?! Shame, dishonor, fear, feigning illness, eating and drinking, dazed... filled with bad ideas; in short, I was determined at the time: "No matter who I fight for, I will never fight again!"
　　After one month, two months, three months... hearing and seeing; military and political education; the liberated area is really different! Poor old people are in charge, struggle against landlords, struggle against despots, distribute fields, distribute land, distribute houses, distribute property, distribute livestock; PLA leaders have no official airs, they are both loving and polite to themselves; feigning illness, the hospital clearly knows but still takes care of and treats them in every possible way; later, Chairman Mao also told the military region leaders to transfer us from the front to the military and political university to study. A worker who had always been oppressed, bullied, and looked down upon in the old society, today, unexpectedly, the hard times have come to an end, and he has become a "liberated soldier," truly liberated! Sugar worker, sugar worker, my poor sugar worker, finally tasted the first sweetness in the world, and became a college student in Chairman Mao's university. Thinking back to when I was deceived by the "disaster army" to "learn culture," the result was that they wanted us to be their cannon fodder for traitors. Unexpectedly, in the study at the Military and Political University, acting, singing, learning to read, attending classes, doing exercises, the culture of the motherland, the culture of the motherland, I never dreamed that it would be given to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao after liberation! …
　　I am beginning to truly understand the deep and great meaning of the four words "liberated soldier"! The more I think about it, the happier I am, and the more motivated I become. A few days ago, I read the "Land Law Outline," I read it over and over again, and also made some notes; thinking that my family has had no fields, no land, and no house for generations; if we fight back to Taiwan and establish a new Taiwan, thoroughly dividing the land according to the "Land Law" promulgated by the CCP Central Committee, struggling against landlords, and turning things over; then, my sister, brother, and all poor brothers and sisters will be extremely happy!
　　This day last year — January 9th, I felt annoyed, angry, and sad whenever I mentioned or thought about it. Now I know that "January 9th" is equal to the revolutionary festival of the "February 28th" movement in which our Taiwan people opposed the heinous rule of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Chen Yi and his ilk, showing our rebirth, and being the most glorious, most joyful, and most happy day when we moved from darkness to light and from hell to paradise!
　　Since that day, after various facts and education, I have gradually realized that this new world we have arrived at, this liberated area of the people, is precisely the real motherland we have longed for for a long time, the one we have encountered in all our disappointments! This, this is precisely the model of the new world that our Taiwan people need to fight for with blood and sweat to win!
　　Even more interesting and promising is that from September 17th last year, a big red flower bloomed in my life — I, a sugar worker, a "liberated soldier," was approved by the Military University Party Committee to become a member of the proletarian vanguard — the Communist Party!
　　This is really... joyful, earth-shattering, something I would never have thought of in generations. At the time, I wrote this in my "motives for joining the Party":
　　"I saw in the battles at the front that the Communist PLA is indeed good, liberating me, and liberating many brothers like me. I also saw that Communist Party members are heroic, resolute and take the lead in completing tasks. From there, I felt that the Communist Party is good, and becoming one is glorious.
　　After arriving at the school, I understood more about what the Communist Party does in Party classes; so in the class discussion, I asked to join the Communist Party.
　　I am joining the Communist Party because it is a party that seeks happiness for the poor people; after joining, it is good to fight back to Taiwan under the leadership of the Communist Party and establish a new Taiwan where our workers and peasants are the masters."
　　Yes! These words I wrote cannot be forgotten, not even a single word. This is an oath to the Party, and it is the direction of all my future actions and efforts!
　　I am very young and very naive; I can't explain many things clearly, and I understand very few principles. However, Director Li of the Political Department gave us instructions on behalf of the Party Committee:
　　"Everyone must step up military, political, and cultural learning, improve tactics and techniques, and further clarify the class viewpoint; Taiwan is Taiwan of the workers and peasants of Taiwan, and Taiwan of the Chinese people! Liberating Taiwan requires the joint efforts of the people of the whole country! Especially our Taiwanese comrades, Taiwanese Communist Party members, must be even more prepared with their own strength! Recognize the situation, recognize the enemy and ourselves; recognize the task of liberating ourselves, first of all, we must rely on ourselves to have wisdom, courage, and strength to shoulder it! To resolutely complete and strive for the final victory!..." — This, this brief and powerful teaching, I can never forget it.
　　"Liberating Taiwan is first of all our own task! As a glorious young Communist Party member, this should be even more my own task!" — That night under the light, I firmly wrote these words in my diary again.

　　“我要打回台湾去！”
  　产业工人曾福源的自述
    柏桦记录
    我原来是个糖厂的产业工人，姓曾名福源。台湾有三大族：高山族最大也最久；还有广东族和福建族，我就是广东族新竹县人。
    家里无田、无地、无房屋。三岁上，母亲因操劳过度，没钱吃药累死了。十一岁上，日本鬼抽税抽款，父亲一人劳动，不能维持生活，地主就硬逼着把我姐姐霸去了。不几月，父亲又累得吐血；想吃点东西，无钱买，一天一天拖着，就一直拖到断气的时候，听他说了几句话：“有钱的地主把你姐姐霸去当牲畜使唤，我病到这样死了连棺材也准备不起；咱们几辈子遭人白眼，你们一定要有出息，要有……”
    我当时正念小学，我知道爸爸是怎样在饥一顿，饱一顿供我去念书的，心里越忿就越想：“警官是最威风的！将来我要去考警官学校，毕业后好叫我姐姐过几天好日子，杀几个地主老财，给我父母报了那冤仇！……”
    当时，年纪小、程度差、资格低不用说，眼前连吃的都没有，可怎么办呢？生活越来越苦，盐水配着红薯过日子，加上日本鬼要税金，咱交不上，罚钱、打骂，结果一纸长条还封闭了我家门。
    一年一年艰难的过去了，到了十四岁时，日本鬼又把哥哥征去南洋当军夫，后来入冷果店做工；一天做十四个钟头，只得四毛钱。哥哥顾不了自己，更顾不了我；我饿着肚子也不能餐餐喝西北风呀！就只得跑到糖工厂做童工，一天劳动十二点钟，累得我常常昏倒过去；瞅瞅四周，想歇一会儿吧！“八格牙牙罗！”“乒！”拿着短木棒的日本监工，连打连骂：“你们这些苦力小鬼！一天挣五毛钱，不好好干活，撕了撕了的！”——简直把我的魂都骇掉了！
    “好吧！以后我赚了钱，念好书考了警官再说！”当时，我一边挨了打，一边还是想当警官报复报复的。——我不知道警官就是日本鬼子、老财们的走狗；当了警官只更增加那些狐群狗党的爪牙，救不了我那可怜的家庭和我这挨打受气的命。……
    工厂潮湿而又闷气，头生疮了，不给医治；劳动、劳动，生了疮，一直流脓流到满身，放出去，等朋友们帮忙治好，结果，厂主又把过去几十天的工资，连老本也给我克去了。……
    这些，也还是一堆小事，是危险的，那就是十七岁——四五年的热天，美国的飞机拼命的轰炸台湾，我被派去修理飞机场；地上的人乱跑，天上的飞机嗡嗡地东飞西飞，轰隆隆的不停的扔炸弹；我们想跑吧，附近日本鬼子的机枪又早已安置好了；它打不上美国飞机，就象疯狗样只是吆喝着，扫射着咱们这些做工的人们；一个工友倒下去了！接着是第二、第三，一直到数十个。……
    我当时只是卧倒在地上，祈祷着神灵，要保佑我们这些受苦受难的工人………。
    飞机过去了，扫射也停止了，周围一看，死了几十个人啊！——过去受日本鬼子的骗，只以为应该“尽忠天皇陛下，死了也是命定的！”而现在想想：死了的这些人还不都是我们阶级的兄弟，作了日本法西斯战争的牺牲品，资本家、地主自在享福，既不来修飞机场，又不致被打死；想来想去，什么“天皇”、“神仙”，还不都是期侮咱工人！？老财、日本鬼，还不都是把咱不当人，叫咱替他作送死鬼么。……
    　　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★
    同一年十月，国民党军队开到台湾来了。我们都想：“中央军”来了一定要救济咱们的！一定再不过苦日子了！我们从此见了青天——我到了自己的祖国了。
    但是，事实是怎样呢？国民党军队带来的，却是比日本仔更凶的烧、杀、淫、掠；接收大员满天飞，工厂倒闭，粮食恐慌，商店关门，人心惶惶；而骗钱、骗兵、奸淫、杀人的事情，更是越来越多了。
    “愿当兵者，每月饷金三千元，完全平等；可学打拳与文化，每两周准许回家一次；最多两年时间，愿再干者可干下去，不愿者可解甲归田或从事其他职业。……”
    ——好漂亮的“堂堂乎”国民党军“招兵”的幌子呵！把多少台湾青年都哄骗进去了！……
    我是个失业的糖工，给别人制糖，自己却吃了一辈子苦。我如果知道当时工厂倒闭，咱们这伙工人没饭吃就是这群混世魔王搞的鬼，我宁死也绝不去当兵！又如果知道“遭殃军”里边是那么坑我、饿我、打我，左欺右骗的竟把我送到华北内战战场上替蒋介石当炮灰，来屠杀的又是咱们自己的阶级弟兄，我，天良！天良！我也是要跳海或早逃跑或与他干起来的！
    我……什么也不知道；我们当时只是埋怨命运不好，或说几句：“狗（日本）走了，猪（蒋介石）又来了，——狗还能看门，猪来何用？”以发泄发泄胸中郁气。我……我们只知道过的不是人过的生活；台湾，可怜的富庶的台湾，仍然被禽兽统治着！老人们流着眼泪，叹气吞声；穷苦的青年人过去当牲畜，今天还是当牛马；青春的姑娘，本来是漂亮，今天却蒙上了说不完的痛苦和羞辱。我们，据老辈子说，老早就见不到太阳，见不到光明；“祖国！”“祖国！”我们所热烈狂欢，流着眼泪所迎来的国民党军“祖国”呵！给我们的，都是叫我们更加走向黑暗、灾难、痛苦、饥饿、死亡！
    　　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★
    天大的幸事！去年的今天——一月九日，金乡鱼台外围大战的那一天；苍天有眼，我……我们总算被共产党解放军把我解放过来了！
    “解放战士”，以前我一听说就难过；“解放过来了！”那还不就是俘虏过来了吗！？羞耻、不光荣、害怕、装病、吃吃喝喝，昏昏沉沉……装满了一脑袋坏主意；总之，我当时狠了几狠：“不管为谁打，我是再也不愿打仗了！”
    经过一月、两月、三月……耳闻、目见；军事、政治，开会教育；解放区可真是不同！穷苦老百姓当家、斗地主、斗恶霸、分田、分地、分房子、分财产、分牲畜；解放军首长没官架子，对自己既爱护又客气；自己装病，医院明知道还是百般照顾、治疗；以后，毛主席又告诉军区首长，从前方调咱们来军政大学学习，一个在旧社会从来被人压迫、欺侮、瞧不起的工人，今天，想不到，苦尽甜来，当了“解放战士”，果真得了解放！糖工，糖工，我好苦命的糖工，竟尝到了人世间的第一次甜头，当了毛主席大学里的大学生了。想当年被“遭殃军”骗去“学文化”，结果是要我们当他们卖国贼的炮灰。想不到，在军政大学的学习里，演戏、唱歌、识字、上课、出操，祖国的文化，祖国的文化呵，连作梦也想不到，竟在被解放后由共产党、毛主席给与我们了！………
    我是开始真正懂得“解放战士”这四个字的又深又大的意义了！我越想越高兴，也就越有了劲。前几天，我看了“土地法大纲”，我读了一遍又一遍，还作了一些笔记；想着自己几辈子没田、没地、没房屋；如果打回台湾去，建立起新台湾，按照中共中央公布的“土地法”彻底平分土地、斗地主、闹翻身；咱，咱姐姐、哥哥，所有穷兄弟、姊妹，可也就快活得不行了！
    去年的今天——一月九日，当时一提起，一思想，就感到恼火，气忿，伤心。现在已经知道了，“一·九”正等于咱们台湾人民反对蒋匪陈仪辈狗徒的万恶统治，所爆发的“二·二八”运动的革命节日一样，是显示了我们的新生，是我们由黑暗走向光明、由地狱进入天堂的最光荣、最愉快、最感觉幸福的一天了！
    从那天起，经过各种事实的证明与教育，使我渐渐认识到，我们所到了的这新天地，这人民的解放区，这不就正是我们渴望了很久，在一切的失望中所遇到的真正的祖国！这，这不就正是咱们台湾人民需要用血汗去斗争以赢得的新天地的模型！？
    更有一桩使我最感兴趣，最感前途远大的，就是：从去年九月十七日起，我的生命里开了一朵大红花——我，一个糖工，一个“解放战士”，被军大党委批准成为无产阶级先锋队——共产党的一员了！
    这对于我实在是………欢天喜地，惊天动地，几辈子。也不会想到有今天的。我当时在“入党的动机的”里这么写着：
    “我在前方战斗里，看见共产党解放军的确是好，解放了我，也解放了和我一样的许多弟兄。我也看见共产党员英勇、坚决带头完成任务。从那里我就感到共产党好，当上光荣。
    到学校后，上党课更明白共产党是干什么的了；所以在班里讨论时，我就要求参加共产党。
    我参加共产党，是因为这是个替穷苦人民谋幸福的党；参加后，好在共产党领导下，打回台湾去，建立咱们工农当主人的新台湾。”
    是的！我写的这些话是一句一字也不能忘记的。这是对党的誓言，也就是我今后一切行动努力的方向！
    我很年青，很幼稚；许多意思都说不太清楚，懂道理也懂得很少。但，政治部李主任代表党委给我们的指示：
    “大家必需要加紧军、政、文化学习，提高战术与技术，进一步明确阶级观点；台湾是台湾工农的台湾，中国人民的台湾！解放台湾要全国人民共同努力！特别是我们台湾同志，台湾的共产党员，要更加准备好自己的力量！认清时局，认清敌我；认清自己解放自己的任务，首先要靠自己有智谋，有勇气，有力量去担当！去坚决的完成与争取最后的胜利！……”——这，这简短而有力的教导呵，我是永远不能忘记的。
    “解放台湾，这首先是我们自己的任务！我，作为一个光荣的年青的共产党员，这更应当是我自己的任务！”——当天夜里在灯光下，我又结结实实的把这些话记在了自己的日记本上。
