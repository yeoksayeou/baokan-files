Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 22nd: A movement opposing the US and British imperialist plot to split Germany is vigorously unfolding throughout Germany. Each occupation zone is holding its own people's representative conferences, and is sending representatives to attend the Second National People's Congress to be held in Berlin on March 18th. The movement demanding German unification and a just peace has not only won the support of the majority of the people, but has also received an enthusiastic response from the vast number of party members of all parties. Kluge, the vice chairman of the Free Democratic Party in Bad Pyrmont (southwest of Hanover), recently declared his unconditional support for the congress. The chairman of the Lower Saxony Party in the Nordham district (mouth of the Elbe River) expressed his willingness to participate in the People's Congress. Even within the Social Democratic Party of the imperialist lackey Schumacher, an increasing number of party members are demanding to participate in the congress. The "Young Eagles," the youth organization of the Braunschweig Social Democratic Party, has decided to send representatives to the Bremen conference. The party's reactionary leading organs are attempting to use the despicable means of expelling party members to prevent their participation in the People's Congress, which has aroused the indignation of party members. Wilhelm Mieth, the second chairman of the Nuremberg Social Democratic Party, who was expelled from the party for participating in the first National People's Congress in Berlin, recently published an open letter in the German News, fiercely criticizing the reactionary policies of the Social Democratic Party's leading organs. Dick, a member of the "German Committee for Peace" in Bavaria in the US occupation zone (a Social Democrat), also criticized: Expelling party members who participate in the People's Congress is a dictatorial method. He demanded that a referendum be held by party members to decide on the attitude towards the People's Congress.

　　反对美英分裂德国
  　德人民纷开代表大会
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】综合柏林讯：一个反对美、英帝国主义分裂德国阴谋的运动，正在全德蓬勃展开。各占区正在召开各自的人民代表大会，并选派代表出席将于三月十八日在柏林召开之第二次全国人民代表大会。要求德国统一及正义和平的运动，不仅得到大多数人民的拥护，而且得到各党派广大党员的热烈响应。巴配蒙（汉诺威西南）的自由民主党副主席克鲁格，顷宜布他无保留地支持大会。诺德汉区（易北河口）的下萨克森党主席表示愿意参加人民大会。甚至在帝国主义走狗舒马赫的社会民主党内部，要求参加大会的党员亦日益增多。布隆斯威社会民主党青年组织“苍鹰”，已决定派代表参加不来梅大会。该党反动领导机关企图用开除党籍的卑劣手段，来阻止党员的参加人民大会，此举已引起该党党员的愤懑。因参加柏林的首次全国人民大会被开除党籍的努连堡社会民主党第二主席威廉密岳，近在德意志新闻发表一封公开信，猛烈抨击社会民主党领导机关的反动政策。美占区巴伐利亚“德国争取和平”委员会委员狄克（社会民主党员），亦抨击称：开除参加人民大会的党员，是独裁的办法。他要求由党员举行复决，以决定对人民代表大会的态度。
