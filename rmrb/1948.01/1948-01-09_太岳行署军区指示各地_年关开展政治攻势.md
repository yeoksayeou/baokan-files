Taiyue Administrative Office Military Region Directs All Areas to Launch Political Offensive During the New Year
[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 6th] The Administrative Office Military Region issued a joint notice instructing all areas to launch a political offensive against the enemy during the New Year, using various relationships to distribute "Deserter Reception Certificates" to disintegrate the bandit army. Each county, district, and village bordering the enemy should: (1) establish reception stations for Chiang and Yan soldiers who desert, giving sympathy and comfort to Chiang and Yan soldiers who surrender to our side or flee home, and providing food and lodging; (2) for those who come over with weapons, in addition to giving them spiritual comfort, their weapons can be disarmed immediately, and the people and guns transferred to the sub-district. If they are local tyrannical regime personnel, they can be sent to the commissioner's office for separate reports to the military region or administrative office for handling; (3) contraband, documents, and public funds brought by fleeing Chiang bandit soldiers should be stored and transferred to higher levels along with the person, and private property of deserters should not be confiscated or bought; (4) Chiang and Yan personnel released by us should be escorted out of the border according to the designated route, so that they can return home safely, in order to expand political influence. The Administrative Office Military Region has also established reward measures for personnel who come over with weapons.
