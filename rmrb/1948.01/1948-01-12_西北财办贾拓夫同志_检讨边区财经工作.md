Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 8th. Comrade Jia Tuofu, Deputy Director of the Northwest Financial and Economic Office, conducted a self-criticism on the financial and economic work of the border region in the past two years at the Northwest Bureau cadre conference. He first criticized his mistake of emphasizing finance and neglecting the economy, and emphasizing commerce and neglecting production, in the implementation of the general policy of developing the economy, ensuring supply, and taking into account both public and private interests. He then separately reviewed the work in trade, finance, and other areas. He said: Trade work should originally serve public and private production, but before October of the previous year, the border region trade company neglected the exchange and adjustment of internally produced goods and the storage of materials, and only paid attention to absorbing large amounts of currency, gold, and silver. As a result, after October, it felt that there was a shortage of materials, and financial and commodity prices fluctuated. Because of the neglect of the internal market, a passive and indifferent attitude was adopted towards the business of cooperatives, and it was preferred to sell goods through private merchants. Moreover, the cooperatives were mostly controlled by wealthy peasants and speculative merchants, and followed a commercial speculation route. Production was divorced from the masses, and internal trade freedom became self-flowing, essentially allowing speculative profiteers to exploit and control the people's economic life. In foreign trade, the effort to tightly control exports of local products was also not successful, resulting in a reduction in the sales volume of salt, and losses in prices. In particular, the lifting of the ban on cigarettes and other luxury goods in March of the previous year resulted in the leakage of funds equivalent to 20,000 shi of millet from the border region within six months.

Finance should also take developing the economy as its main task, but the currency issued in the previous year was used more for financial expenditures and less for economic development. The amount of loans issued was also less than in previous years. There was also a bias towards commerce and away from agriculture in loan targets, especially the erroneous policy of the bank attempting to invest in commerce and expand its capital base, which resulted in facilitating commercial speculation and smuggling. In addition, public-owned economic entities, in implementing the policy of centralized leadership and decentralized management, experienced serious departmentalism, failed to unite into a unified force, and even violated government laws and regulations. As a result, the rise in commodity prices and financial chaos in the border region in the previous year increased the burden on the people.

In past production movements, there was a lack of a class line. For example, in agriculture, the Wu Manyou direction was promoted, but there was no serious assistance to the vast number of hired and poor peasants in production, and most of the agricultural loans were not distributed to hired and poor peasants. Some areas did not distribute them at all. The assistance to hired and poor peasant family handicraft sideline production was neglected, while emphasis was placed on assisting the factories, workshops, or transportation businesses of wealthy peasants and even landlords. The wholesale business of the trade company actually helped the wealthy. In the labor model movement, very few hired and poor peasants were elected as heroes, proving that this movement had a weak connection with hired and poor peasants. In terms of burdens, there was also a bias towards heavy burdens on agriculture and light burdens on commerce, and heavy burdens on the poor and light burdens on the rich. Then, Comrade Tuofu analyzed the root causes of this bias, which were the impure composition of financial and economic cadres and the lack of a mentality of serving the vast number of poor workers and peasants. Financial and economic cadres, especially in state-owned stores, were infiltrated by many landlords, wealthy peasants, and old merchants, and even counter-revolutionaries. As a result, all kinds of non-proletarian ideas occurred and spread extensively during this period. Comrade Tuofu made a self-criticism, saying: "Although I myself was not born into a landlord or wealthy peasant family, I also accepted the influence of their ideas, and blurred my class viewpoint in the long-term peaceful environment. At the same time, in terms of thinking methods, the test of practical work during this period also proved that I still had the problem of subjectivism and old experience, and committed conservative tendencies. This proves that although I have gone through long-term work, rectification, and the Seventh National Congress education, I have not learned well, and I am even more aware of how difficult it is to be a student of Chairman Mao." He then criticized his leadership style for having the shortcomings of bureaucracy and liberalism, failing to use cadres carefully and solve problems in a timely manner, which led to serious development. For example, errors such as a small number of personnel engaging in private gain at public expense, muddying the waters to fish for profits, embezzlement and corruption, and some cadres panicking and losing public grain and large quantities of materials during the early stages of the battle. Comrade Tuofu further criticized the relationship between the financial and economic departments and the Party, believing that there was a tendency to seek independence from the Party. He also made a self-criticism, saying: "Sometimes, when the Party's opinions did not suit my own interests, I thought they were not feasible and resisted them. This attitude is actually a tendency to break away from the Party's leadership. The result is to harm the interests of the Party and the people." He stated that he was determined to serve the people wholeheartedly in the future, resolutely implement the Party's financial and economic policies, and overcome all difficulties to strive for victory in the war to liberate the Northwest.

　　西北财办贾拓夫同志
  　检讨边区财经工作
    【新华社西北八日电】西北财经办事处副主任贾拓夫同志在西北局干部大会上检讨近两年来边区财经工作。他首先检讨在执行发展经济保证供给及公私兼顾的总方针中，犯了偏重财政忽视经济和重商业轻生产的偏向。接着分别检讨贸易、金融等工作。他说：贸易工作原应为公私生产服务，但边区贸易公司在前年十月前忽视了内部市场生产品的交流调剂及储存物资，只注意大量吸收货币金银，于是十月后感到物资不足，金融物价波动。因对内部市场忽视，对合作社业务又采消极不理态度，宁肯经过私商销售货物；而合作社又多为富农及投机商人所把持，走了商业投机路线，生产脱离群众，内部贸易自由变成自流，实质上是让投机奸商去剥削和控制人民的经济生活。在对外贸易上。也未抓紧输出土产品，使食盐销售量减少，价格上也吃了亏。特别是前年三月对纸烟迷信品等的开禁，六个月内即使边区漏出资金折合达二万石小米。
    金融亦应以发展经济为其主要任务，但前年发行的通货用于财政开支多，用于发展经济的少。发放贷款的数量，也比历年都少。贷款对象又有重商轻农偏向，特别是银行企图投资商业、壮大基金的错误方针，结果便利了商业投机和走私。加之公营经济在执行集中领导分散经营方针中，发生严重的本位主义，未能团结为统一力量，甚至违反政府法令，于是造成了前年边区物价的上涨和金融混乱，加重了人民负担。
    在过去的生产运动中，缺乏阶级路线，如农业中提倡吴满有方向，但没有认真帮助广大雇贫农生产，农贷也大多未放到雇贫农手中，个别区根本未放下去。忽视扶助雇贫农家庭手工副业生产，而偏重扶助富农甚至地主的工厂作坊或运输业。贸易公司的批发，实际上也是帮助了富有者。在劳模运动中，雇贫农当选英雄者很少，证明这一运动与雇贫农联系很弱。在负担上，也有农重商轻，贫重富轻的偏向。接着，拓夫同志分析产生这种偏向的根源，是财经干部成份不纯，及缺乏为广大贫苦工农群众服务的思想。财经干部，特别是公营商店，混进不少地主富农及旧商人，甚至反革命分子。因而各种各样非无产阶级的思想，在这一时期就大量的发生与蔓延起来了。拓夫同志自我检讨说：“我自己虽非出身于地主富农阶级，但也接受了他们思想的影响，并在长期和平环境中模糊了自己的阶级观点。同时在思想方法上，这一期间实际工作的考验，也证明还有主观主义的毛病和守旧经验，犯了保守倾向。这证明我虽经过长期工作，整风和七大教育，但还没有学好，更觉悟到作毛主席的小学生何等不易。”他接着检讨自己领导作风上有官僚主义自由主义的毛病，未能慎重使用干部，及时解决问题，以致发展到严重程度。如少数人员假公济私、混水摸鱼、贪污腐化，及战斗初期某些干部惊惶失措，丢失公粮及大批物资等错误。拓夫同志进一步检讨财经部门与党的关系时，认为有对党闹独立的倾向。他并自我检讨说：“有时党的意见不适合我自己的兴趣，我就认为行不通而加以抵抗，这种态度其实际就是脱离党的领导的倾向。其结果便是损害党与人民的利益。”他表明今后决心全心全意为人民服务，坚决贯彻党对财经工作的方针政策，克服一切困难以争取解放西北战争的胜利。
