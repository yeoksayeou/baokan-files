　　Platoon Leader Wang Minghuan Sabotages Land Reform
　　Military and Civilians Publicly Try Him and Announce Death Sentence
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 2nd] On December 7th of last year, the Jinan People's Liberation Army × unit and the local masses held a public trial of Wang Minghuan, platoon leader of the 2nd Company of the × Regiment. He was found guilty of stealing the fruits of the masses' struggle, stabbing the masses who captured him, sabotaging land reform, and violating the discipline of the People's Liberation Army. He has been sentenced to death by the army. On December 4th, Wang Minghuan visited the exhibition of the fruits of the masses' struggle in the village where he was stationed (Xiading Village, Wenxi County) and stole a glass, which contained a small Buddha statue and other items. The masses saw him and asked him to return it. Not only did he not admit his mistake and return the items, but he also cursed: "Without us fighting at the front, how could you have turned yourselves over?" "The stuff belonged to the landlord; none of it is yours!" When the civil affairs cadre found out, he forced him to return the items to the village. Wang Minghuan harbored resentment from then on and wanted to retaliate. He even incited individual soldiers, preparing to kill the militiamen. The militiamen were very afraid and reported to the militia company commander. The militia company commander saw that the matter was serious and went to detain Wang Minghuan, preparing to hand him over to the higher authorities for processing. Wang Minghuan saw the militiamen coming to detain him, and while cursing, he snatched the militiamen's gun and slapped them several times, tying up the militiamen. Many militiamen and masses waiting outside for news saw that the people who went in had not come out for a long time, fearing something had happened, and squeezed inside to see. Wang Minghuan picked up a bayonet and stabbed an old man in the stomach, creating a two-inch-long wound. The masses quickly found the district chief, and Wang Minghuan punched the district chief several times. After this incident, the leaders of the unit believed that Wang Minghuan, as a cadre, casually stole the fruits of the masses' struggle, stabbed the masses who captured him, beat the district chief of the democratic government, sabotaged land reform, and violated the discipline of the People's Liberation Army. His crime was very serious and could not be forgiven. Therefore, on December 7th, a public trial was held, he was expelled from the military, and handed over to military law for processing. The army accepted the opinions of the masses, and according to army rules, sentenced Wang Minghuan to death. Wang Gengchen, a soldier who had been deceived by him, confessed his mistakes on the spot and was given a lenient sentence.
