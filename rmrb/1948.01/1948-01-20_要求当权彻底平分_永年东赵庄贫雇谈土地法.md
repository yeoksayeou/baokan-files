Demanding Power to Thoroughly Distribute
　　Poor and Hired Peasants of Dongzhao Village, Yongnian, Discuss the Land Law

[Yongnian News] On the evening of January 11th, Dongzhao Village in the Sixth District of Yongnian held a forum for poor and hired peasants and publicized the Outline Land Law. Four impoverished people (all hired laborers) and two poor peasants, who had just moved from the temple, participated. They first discussed the situation of emancipation. Old Lady Li said, "I am an impoverished household and have been allocated a cabinet seat." Li Encheng said, "I am a poor peasant, and people only gave me two flower vases." Then everyone scrambled to talk about the struggle in the second half of last year: "From the struggle that started on the second day of the sixth lunar month, we struggled for five or six months. The meetings delayed production, and we divided some land, but we didn't harvest any grain in the autumn. Now it's all eaten up. But up to now, the village peasant association still has more than two qing of good irrigated land, three hundred or so cloth bags (four dou per bag) of grain, vegetables, and furniture… that have not been distributed. Sixteen or seventeen livestock are all starved to the bone, and one recently died." When talking about the reasons for not being thoroughly emancipated, everyone unanimously said: "Poor people's words don't count. There are thirty or so poor peasant households in the whole village, and not a single one is a cadre." When the central government's Outline Land Law was told to everyone, they listened very attentively. When it came to the thorough distribution of land, first satisfying the demands of the poor and hired peasants, they said: "That's how it should be. That's what you call true emancipation; otherwise, it will still be uneven." When it came to peasants being in charge, they were particularly interested: "In the past, it was the middle peasants who were emancipated. We at the bottom still haven't been lifted up," "If the poor don't take charge, it will never be thorough." Finally, everyone unanimously stated that this matter should be handled quickly.

　　要求当权彻底平分
  　永年东赵庄贫雇谈土地法
    【永年消息】一月十一号晚上，永年六区东赵庄开了一个贫雇座谈会，并宣传土地法大纲，参加的有四个赤贫（都是雇工），两个贫农，他们是刚从庙里搬来的。先谈到翻身情形，李老太太说：“我是赤贫户，分了一个柜座。”李恩成说：“我是贫农，人家只给我两个插瓶。”于是大家又抢着谈去年下半年的斗争：“从阴历六月初二斗争起，一直斗了五、六个月，开会误了生产，分了点地，秋天没打下粮食，现在早吃光了，可是到现在村农会还有两顷多好水地，三百来布袋（一布袋四斗）粮食、菜蔬和家具……没有分。十六、七条牲口，都饿成骨架了，最近还死了一头”。谈到没翻透身的原因时，大家一致说是：“穷人说话不顶事，全村贫农三十来户，一个当干部的也没有。”当把中央颁布的土地法大纲告诉大家的时候，他们非常静心的倾听，说到彻底平分土地，首先满足贫雇要求，他们说：“就该这样，那才叫真翻身哩，不然还是高低不平。”说到要农民当家，他们特别感到兴趣：“过去是中间的翻身啦，咱底下的还是没翻上来”，“穷人不当家永弄不彻底。”最后大家一致表示，这事要快点办才好。（文云）
