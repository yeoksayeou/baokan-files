Taiyue News: The Army Region Health Department's hospital work over the past year, under the call of "develop new therapies and medical service to love soldiers and establish meritorious service movement, achieve 90% of wounds not festering, 50% of new injuries discharged within a month, and fractured bones healed in three months," has completed and exceeded the task. On the issue of developing new therapies, the old routine of "changing dressings every day" was broken. This old routine had become a habit for both the wounded soldiers and the doctors. If a wounded soldier didn't have their dressing changed for a day, they would scold the doctor for being irresponsible; the doctors also thought it wouldn't work if a wounded soldier's dressing wasn't changed every other day. Later, the hospital promoted new therapies. Education was conducted for the wounded soldiers and all hospital medical staff from the theoretical to the practical effects, opening up everyone's minds, and great achievements were obtained, increasing the number of discharges and expanding the capacity, achieving a new record of rapidly restoring combat effectiveness and reducing the suffering of the wounded and sick. According to the statistics of the past year: new therapies achieved more than 80% of the wounded not festering, in a 300-person capacity clinic, only 60 to 80 people needed dressing changes a day. This saved a lot of manpower and resources, allowed for better care of the wounded soldiers, reduced the pain of the wounded soldiers, and was able to accommodate more wounded and sick. The annual capacity of each clinic has been increased two to three times. The Fourth Field Hospital's capacity in November reached more than three times, and the work was still in good order. The number of new injuries being discharged within one month also reached 50% completely. Because dressings were not changed every day, a lot of materials were saved: for example, the Nineteenth Sub-district directly subordinate clinic, in the past, each wounded soldier used 2.18 chi of powder cloth and 7.1 liang of cotton per day, since the implementation of new therapies, only 1.5 chi of powder cloth and 1.1 liang of cotton are used per month. At the same time, the mortality rate of patients was reduced: 200 old osteomyelitis injuries that could not be cured by Huang Tianbao, Yang Xinting, etc., were all cured within three months; especially more than 100 comrades like Liu Fugui, who had the most difficult-to-treat fracture sores, were also cured and discharged within three months.
    In nursing work, for the past year, the nurses and staff have taken care of the patients with an extremely kind and patient attitude, feeding them water and meals, helping them with urination and defecation, tidying up the beds, wiping their bodies, washing their feet, preventing bedsores, making mosquito nets, weaving baskets, making brooms, and other work. In the winter, a three-warm movement of warm meals, [unclear], and warm bedding was proposed. For example, nurse Zhang Suogui used heated bricks under the feet of seriously wounded soldiers at night, changing them three times a night, making the wounded soldiers feel very comfortable. Qin Wenzhi fed Han Deqi, who was seriously injured in the head and unconscious, milk four times a day and water twenty times a day, making the wounded soldier regain consciousness within five days and get through the danger period. In order to do the work well even when the tasks were heavy, the nurses also organized three major mutual aid programs: work mutual aid, learning mutual aid, and ideological mutual aid. Clear division of labor, active mutual assistance, carrying out learning in the work, and collectively studying to improve the work.
    In this situation, the convalescing comrades were also moved. They automatically organized themselves to help the hospital work. For example, Mao Jidu, the leader of the convalescent class of the Fifth Hospital, led ten people to help the hospital deliver boiled water and meals during the day, and sent boiled water to the convalescents in groups at night. The convalescents of the Fourth Field Hospital developed from one "Love Diligence Class" to eight "Love Diligence Classes." The wounded and sick soldiers all worked hard to help the hospital with everything they could. Over the past year, the wounded and sick soldiers and staff have encouraged each other, praised each other, and jointly carried out meritorious service, and everyone got along like a family. In particular, the affiliated hospital launched the Zhao Zhiyong learning movement among the convalescents, making the hospital convalescent life school-like, which has achieved many results in improving the political awareness and cultural level of the convalescents.

### 太岳卫生部一年的医院工作　使用新疗法有显著成绩

　　太岳卫生部一年的医院工作
  　使用新疗法有显著成绩
    【太岳消息】军区卫生部一年来的医院工作，在“开展新疗法及医务爱兵立功运动、实现百分之九十的创伤不化脓，新伤一月内治疗百分之五十的出院数，三个月治好一个骨折伤”的号召下，完成并超过了任务。在开展新疗法问题上，打破了“天天换药”的老一套治疗法，这一种老一套的办法在伤员与医生中，都成了习惯。伤员一天不换药，就要骂医生不负责；医生也认为伤员隔一天不换药，那还能行？以后医院推行新疗法。从理论到实际效果向伤员和全院医务干部进行教育，打通了大家的思想，获得了很大的成绩，增加了出院数与扩大了收容量，做到了迅速恢复战斗力减少伤病员痛苦的新记录。据去年一年的统计：新疗法达到了百分之八十以上的伤员不化脓，收容三百人的卫生所里，一天只有六十至八十人需要换药。这就节省出很多人力与物力，可以更好的护理伤员，减少伤员的痛苦，并能收容更多的伤病员。全年各所的收容量，有的提高到二倍至三倍。野四所十一月份的收容量达到三倍以上，还是井然有序的工作。新伤一月治疗百分之五十的出院数也完全作到了。由于不每天换药，就大大节省了材料：如十九分区直属所，过去每个伤员每日用粉布二尺一寸八，棉花七两一钱，自施用新疗法后，每月只用粉布一尺五寸，棉花一两一钱。同时减低了病员的伤亡率：黄天保、杨心亭等二百个治不愈的老骨槽伤，三个月内全治好了；特别是刘福贵等百余名，最难治的犯骨折疮的同志三个月内也治愈出院了。
    在护理工作上，一年来看护员、工作人员都以极亲切的耐心的态度去照护病员，替病员喂水喂饭，接应大小便，整理铺位，擦澡、洗脚，防止褥疮，做蚊帐，编筐子、做扫帚等工作。冬天的时候，又提出暖饭、××、暖被褥的三暖运动。如看护张所桂下夜时，用砖烧热放在重伤员的脚下，一夜换三次，使伤员感到非常舒适，秦文治给头部重伤人事不省的韩德其一天喂四次牛乳，廿次水，五天内使伤员意识清醒，渡过危险期。为了在任务繁重还要把工作做好，看护员又组织了三大互助：就是工作互助，学习互助，思想互助。明确的分工，积极的互相帮助，在工作中开展学习，集体研究改进工作。
    在这样的情况下，休养员同志也被感动了。他们自动组织起来，帮助医院工作。如五所休养班长毛继度，带领十个人白天帮助病院送开水打饭，晚上分组给休养员送开水。野四所休养员由一个“爱勤班”，发展到八个“爱勤班”。伤病员都努力帮助医院做一切能做的工作。一年来伤病员与工作人员互相慰勉，互相表扬，共同进行了立功，大家和睦得象一个家庭。特别是附属医院，在休养员中，展开了赵志勇学习运动，使医院休养员生活学校化，对提高休养员的政治觉悟与文化水平上，是有不少成绩的。
