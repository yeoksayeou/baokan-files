　　[News from this newspaper] In Zuoquan, Tongtan's production has been known as a model in the whole county. Since the winter production season, after detailed accounting by county, district, and village cadres, it was found that the cadres only emphasized the model village, and the masses made false reports of "cultivate three, surplus one," which led to a spontaneous flow of winter production. The village cadres thought: "We are a model village! How could we calculate a deficit?" At that time, several calculations were made, but the goal of "cultivate three, surplus one" was not achieved. The cadres complained that the masses' "thinking was not straightened out," and they mobilized the masses again, saying, "You haven't calculated enough? The government people don't help either. If the calculation can complete the surplus grain plan, you will have both fame and fortune." After the mobilization, the masses reflected, "No matter how we calculate, we will reach the surplus, otherwise the 'ya' (referring to village cadres) will say we are backward!" In this way, more than 20 households in Brigade One all achieved "cultivate three, surplus one." The village cadres said happily, "This year's leadership has made no small achievements in production." Comrade Cao Haizhu, a county-level work team member stationed in the village, went to the home of an old farmer, Jia Jisuo, for dinner. During casual conversation, he discovered that "cultivate three, surplus one" was not realistic, and the cadres were taking care of family calculations. For example, Jia Jisuo's family had 15.5 mu of land, and the actual grain harvest this year was 13.8 shi. When checking "cultivate three, surplus one," they were afraid of not reaching the goal, so they overstated it by seven shi. Xu Zhongwei boasted that he had a surplus of three shi of grain, saying, "I am a surplus household, so it doesn't matter if I do less work during the winter production season." He spent 6,000 yuan to hire laborers to transport grain, while he stayed idle at home. After the matter was discovered, the cadres first made ideological self-criticisms. The deputy township head said, "I thought our village was a model village, and failure to complete the surplus grain would affect our work!" At the meeting, Comrade Cao Haizhu said, "If you can't do the accounting for the masses, you can't manage their affairs." Then, the whole town had a second round of family calculations. After calculating 13 households, they were short 74 shi of grain. The myth of "cultivate three, surplus one" was shattered among the cadres and the masses, and the deficit was exposed. The remedial measures are: to reorganize the mutual aid teams in the summer and autumn harvests, increase procurement, provide the masses with paid transportation work, have full laborers drive livestock, and have semi-laborers concentrate on accumulating fertilizer, etc., to find ways to make up for the deficit.

　　桐滩干部欺骗群众谎报耕三余一
    【本报消息】左权桐滩生产，在全县说来向称模范，冬季生产以来，经县区村干作了详细算帐，检查出干部只强调模范村，群众空报耕三余一·一致使冬季生产形成自流。村干认为：“咱是模范村哩！还能算出窟窿来吗？”在当时作了几个计算，未达到耕三余一，干部们埋怨：群众“思想没打通”，又向群众作动员，“你们算的不够了？政府伢也不帮助，如算的能完成耕余计划，名利双全”，群众经过动员，反映是“咱不管怎样算的达到耕余吧，不然伢（指村干）就说咱落后哩”！这样，一大队二十多户都达到了耕三余一，村干部高兴的说：“今年领导的生产成绩不小”。县里住村工作员曹海珠同志，到老农民贾计锁家吃饭，闲拉起家常来，才发现耕三余一不实际，是干部包办算家当。如贾计锁全家有地十五亩半，今年实收粮十三石八，检查耕三余一时，怕达不到，多说了七石。许忠维因算出余粮三石，自骄说：“我是耕余户，冬季生产少动些也没要紧，运粮时花了六千元雇脚，自己在家闲着。事情发觉后，干部先作了思想检查，副镇长说：“我认识咱村是模范村，完不成耕余可影响工作啦！”会上，曹海珠同志说：“给群众算不了帐，也就是给群众当不了家。”接着全镇又来了个二次算家当。计算了十三户，就短粮七十四石，耕三余一在干群里打破了，窟窿露的挺大。补救办法是：把夏秋季互助大队重整顿，另增加采购，给群众包脚运货，全劳力赶牲口，半劳力突击积肥等，想法补窟窿。（海珠、田）
