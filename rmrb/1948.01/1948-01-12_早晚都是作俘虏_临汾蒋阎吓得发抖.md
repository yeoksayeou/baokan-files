Sooner or Later They Will Be Captives
  Linfen Chiang and Yan Tremble with Fear
    [Taiyue News] Our army captured Yuncheng. The Chiang and Yan bandit troops in Linfen were terrified. Chiang bandit Thirty Brigade Commander Yin Yingzhou gathered his 88th Regiment and 90th Regiment in the "Old First Battalion" in the city for a meeting, asking his soldiers, "Can Linfen City be defended?" No one made a sound, and Yin Yingzhou was very discouraged. Yan bandit Liang Peihuang, the local commander-in-chief of Linfen, Pei Cong, director of the Linfen Office of the Shanxi Provincial Government, and some family members took a plane and fled back to Taiyuan. More than a dozen Yan bandit county governments exiled here, including Changzhi, Jincheng, Anze, Qinshui, Fushan, Hongdong, Zhao Cheng, Xiangning, Jixian, Puxian, Fenxi, Xinjiang, and Xiangling, disguised themselves and fled to Lingshi. Chiang bandit transferred all the garrison troops in the eastern suburbs of the city outside the airport and the electric light company into the city. A small airport was newly built in the northwest corner of the city. The airport outside the city did not dare to take off and land planes. The barbed wire was dismantled and surrounded the city walls. There was a bunker every ten feet on the city, with a total of twenty-seven large bunkers. They are still desperately grabbing the common people to build fortifications and demolishing houses within five miles outside the city. Yan bandit and local stubborn elements were driven out of the city by Chiang bandit to serve as guards, and their morale was extremely low. They said, "The People's Liberation Army is fighting outside, and the Kuomintang troops are fighting from the city outward. We are caught in the middle to die." Regardless of the Chiang and Yan bandit troops, they have no confidence in being trapped in Linfen. A saying is popular among them: "Isn't it just eating millet sooner or later in Linfen!" This means that they will be captured sooner or later.

　　早晚都是作俘虏
  　临汾蒋阎吓得发抖
    【太岳消息】我军打下运城。临汾蒋阎匪军就吓坏了。蒋匪三十旅旅长尹瀛洲集合他的八十八团、九十团在城里“老一营”开会，问他的士兵说：“临汾城能不能守得住？”大家都不哼气，尹瀛洲十分泄气。阎匪临汾地方总指挥梁培璜，山西省政府临汾办事处主任裴琮和一些家眷都坐上飞机逃回太原去了。流亡在这里的阎匪县政府有长治、晋城、安泽、沁水、浮山、洪洞、赵城、乡宁、吉县、蒲县、汾西、新绛、襄陵等十几个都化装往灵石逃走。蒋匪把在城外飞机场电灯公司东关地方的守备部队统统调进城里，还在城内西北角新修了一个小飞机场，城外飞机场也不敢起落飞机，把铁丝网拆回来围在城墙上，城上每隔三丈就有一个碉堡，共有二十七个大碉，现在还拼命抓老百姓修工事，拆毁城外五里以内的民房。阎匪和地方杂顽被蒋匪赶出城里担任守备，士气低落透了。他们说：“人民解放军在外面打，国民党队伍从城里往外打，咱们是夹在中间送死。”不论蒋阎匪军，对困守临汾毫无一点信心，在他们中间流行着这样一句话：“在临汾迟早还不是吃小米！”这个意思是说迟早都是当俘虏。
