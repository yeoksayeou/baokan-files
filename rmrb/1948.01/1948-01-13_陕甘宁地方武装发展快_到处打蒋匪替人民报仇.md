Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 11th: The local armed forces and guerrillas in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region are growing stronger day by day. The Yan'an County Feng Yuanxi Guerrilla Unit, which was commended by the Border Government, has killed, wounded, and captured 96 enemy officers and soldiers below the regimental and battalion level in the past nine months, and uprooted one puppet township office. The number of guerrillas in the Yan'an Reclamation Area has more than quadrupled in nine months of struggle behind enemy lines, killing and wounding 130 enemy troops below the battalion commander level and capturing 312 enemy soldiers. The Anse Tian Qiyuan Guerrilla Unit annihilated 89 enemy troops below the battalion commander level in the anti-"mopping-up" operations from September to November. The No. 4 Detachment of the Ganquan Guerrilla Unit destroyed four puppet township and bao offices in nearly three months, and mobilized the masses to establish two democratic township governments, organizing local people to voice their grievances and join the army to avenge themselves. The detachment has now doubled in size and frequently strikes the enemy on both sides of the Xianyang-Yan'an Highway south of Ganquan.

Around the New Year, the guerrilla units in various parts of the Yan'an Sub-district became more active. On December 26, the puppet Anse County Chief, protected by 20 members of the Bao Police Team, was attacked by our guerrillas on his way to Hezhuangping for the New Year, wiping out 12 of them and seizing New Year's goods such as pork. The guerrilla units in various districts of Yanchuan have been upgraded to local corps, purging impure elements. The companies are now engaged in a competition of military training and literacy.

On New Year's Eve, two local armed units in the Guanzhong Sub-district routed the enemy Chunhua "Self-Defense Battalion" headquarters and its 5th company at dawn. A total of 24 enemy troops were killed or wounded, and 87 were captured alive. In November, the local armed forces in the area annihilated 142 enemy troops and won over Wu Baozhen, the squad leader of the 3rd Regiment of the Security Corps, and 28 others to come over with their weapons.

　　陕甘宁地方武装发展快
  　到处打蒋匪替人民报仇
    【新华社西北十一日电】陕甘宁边区地方武装和游击队正日益壮大。曾得到边府嘉奖的延安县封元喜游击队，九个月来，毙伤俘敌团、营级军官以下官兵九十六名，拔除伪乡公所一座，该队人数发展了十倍。延属垦区游击队在九个月敌后斗争中壮大了四倍多，共毙伤敌营长以下一百卅名，俘敌三百十二名。安塞田启元游击队自九月到十一月，反“清剿”作战中歼敌营长以下八十九名。甘泉游击队四大队在近三个月中摧毁伪乡公所、保公所四个，并发动群众建立两个民主乡政府，组织当地人民伸冤诉苦，参军报仇。该队现已扩大两倍，经常在甘泉以南咸（阳）延（安）公路两侧打击敌人。
    新年前后，延属分区各地游击队更为活跃。十二月二十六日伪安塞县长由保警队二十人保护下往何庄坪过年，途中被我游击队袭击，歼其十二名，并缴到猪肉等各种过年物品。延川各区游击队并已升级为地方兵团，洗刷了成份不纯的分子，现各连正展开练武学文的竞赛。
    关中分区地方武装两部，于除夕日拂晓击溃敌淳化“自卫营”营部及其第五连。计毙伤敌二十四名，生俘八十七名。该区地方武装在十一月份内即歼敌一百四十二名，并争取敌保三团班长吴保珍等二十九人携械来归。
