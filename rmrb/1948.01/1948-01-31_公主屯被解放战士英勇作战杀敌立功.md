Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th: In the Gongzhutun campaign in northern Shenyang, many liberated soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, due to enlightenment and education, gained class consciousness and were able to fight bravely and kill enemies to achieve meritorious deeds. Liberated soldier Feng Ziqing of the eighth company of a certain battalion wrote in his application to join the Party: "My performance in combat is ordinary." Before this battle, he was determined to "not be ordinary." After the battle began, he single-handedly rushed into the enemy's house and threw several grenades, and twenty-two enemies surrendered their guns to him. He handed the prisoners over to the platoon leader and immediately jumped over the courtyard wall and rushed into another room. At this time, the enemy's bayonet was already in front of him. He deflected the bayonet and, in a moment of wit, shouted: "Comrades outside! Rush in! Those who surrender their weapons will be treated with leniency, those who don't will be killed!" Twelve enemies trembled with fear and handed over their guns together. Then, during the general attack, he disarmed thirty Chiang Kai-shek soldiers in a large courtyard. Li Qingyuan, deputy squad leader of the second squad of the ninth company of a certain battalion, who had been commended twice for his merits, was liberated from Chiang Kai-shek's 195th Division last year. In this Wenjiatai battle, the squad leader was wounded, and he immediately commanded the entire squad to continue fighting. They rushed into a small house and wiped out the enemies. However, the enemies surrounded them from the outside. Li Qingyuan did not panic. He placed four soldiers in four corners of the room, and he guarded the window. The enemy's machine gun ten meters away was aimed directly at them. He first shot down the enemy's machine gunner. At this time, the enemy's mountain artillery shells hit, and the sulfur smoke made them dizzy. The enemies rushed up. Li Qingyuan said to the soldiers: "If we hold this house and seize the mountain artillery, we can achieve meritorious deeds." He immediately threw a package of explosives, killing eight enemies. The Chiang bandits then set fire to the house, and they finally broke through the encirclement. Hou Shaojun, a soldier of the seventh squad of the third company of a certain unit, was liberated from Chiang Kai-shek's Qing 2nd Division. In this battle, the squad was an assault team, and the assault point was a gap blasted open. As soon as the entire squad rushed to the wall, the enemy sealed the gap with four light and heavy machine guns. The soldiers were all wounded before the assault. Hou Shaojun untied the grenades from the wounded soldiers and threw them at the enemy, throwing more than thirty in succession. His arm was sore, and the grenades were exhausted. He picked up his rifle and continued to fight until the follow-up troops rushed up and finally wiped out the enemies.

　　公主屯被解放战士英勇作战杀敌立功
    【新华社东北二十九日电】沈北公主屯战役中，解放军某部的许多解放战士，因经过启发教育，有了阶级觉悟，都能英勇作战，杀敌立功。某营八连解放战士冯子青，他在入党志愿书上写着：“战斗中表现平常”，这次战斗前，他下定了决心，一定要“不平常”。战斗开始后，他就单人独枪冲进敌人的屋子去扔了几颗手榴弹，二十二个敌人向他缴了枪。他把俘虏缴给排长，马上又跳过院墙，冲进另一间屋子，这时敌人的刺刀已经到了他的眼前，他拨开刺刀，急中生智地喊：“外面的同志们！冲进来！缴枪的优待，不缴枪的打死”。十二个敌人胆颤心惊，一齐交出枪来。接着在总攻击时，他又在一个大院子里解除了三十个蒋匪军的武装。记过两次功的某营九连二班副班长李庆元，是去年从蒋军一九五师解放过来的，这次文家台战斗，班长负了伤，他即指挥全班，继续作战，他们冲进一个小屋子，把敌人消灭了之后，敌人却在外面把他们包围起来，李庆元毫不慌张，将四个战士布置在四个屋角，他守住窗口，十米达外的敌人机枪正对准扫射，他首先射倒了敌人的机枪射手。这时，敌人山炮弹打过来，硫磺烟将他们熏得头昏脑胀，敌人冲上来了，李庆元向战士说：“我们守住这座房子，夺来山炮，就能立功”，立即把一包炸药投出去，炸死了八个敌人，蒋匪又放火烧房子，他们最后终于突出包围。某部三连七班战士侯少钧，是从蒋军青二师解放过来的，这次战斗中，该班是突击队，突击点是轰炸开的缺口，全班刚突到围墙跟前，敌人以四挺轻重机枪把缺口封锁住，战士们在突击前都负了伤，侯少钧把负伤战士的手榴弹解下来，向敌人打去，先后投了三十多个，胳膊酸了，手榴弹也打光了，他拿起步枪继续战斗，直到后续部队冲上来，终于把敌人消灭。
