　　Landlords Live Well with Good Land, Poor Laborers Lack Land and Go Hungry
  　Incomplete Land Reform in Beizhaolin Village, Qi County
    [Jinan News] Land reform in Beizhaolin Village, Qi County, is far from complete. Landlords still have good houses, good land, and a good life, while poor peasants lack houses and land and still go hungry. During the democratic struggle in the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), this village was not mobilized. In the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), a "laborer and poor peasant movement" was launched, weakening the landlords and rich peasants somewhat. Last year's major movement was still very incomplete. The village has a total of 350 households, with 38 landlord households, but only 20 were struggled against. There were 36 rich peasant households, but only 15 had their tails cut off, and half of those were not thoroughly struggled against. All of them retained a life above the middle peasant level, with each person averaging more than four mu of land. For example, Cheng Degui, Feng Laocu, and Xu Gui each still average seven mu of land; the households that were struggled against still live in many good houses. Yu Laode and Zhang Jingchun, both with eight people in their families, still have 20 tile-roofed houses. Yu Tingyuan and Yu Tingjie still have their original tile-roofed houses. Xu Huai still has a courtyard with two entrances. Qiao Rizhang's house was struggled out, and some people advocated demolishing it, but he took money and bought back part of it at a low price. The lives of the landlords have not changed at all after being struggled against. For example, Qiao Rizhang, Qiao Risheng, Cheng Degui, Zhang Jingchun, Xu Gui, Ma Shuming, and others still raise cattle. Xu Dexue and Xu Jinhai eat and dress even better after being struggled against than before. Only two households out of the more than 30 that were struggled against produced silver dollars, and no underground treasures were unearthed. The Yu family landlords in this village have been wealthy since the Ming Dynasty, and they still live in good houses. The floating wealth that was struggled out was very light, and the underground treasures were not even investigated. When the struggle was going on, Yu Tingzuo ran away. Afterwards, he rode around on a bicycle, dressed lavishly, swaggering down the street, saying that he was in a public hospital and that he and the chief of the Public Security Bureau, Ma Fanglin, were sworn brothers, in order to scare the masses. Therefore, other landlords who had been struggled against also raised their heads greatly. Twenty-nine landlord and rich peasant households that escaped the net (they now have 39 households after dividing their families), with a total of 209 people, still have 1,200 mu of good land, averaging six mu per person, and all raise cattle. Xu Jinxiang raises two large cattle, Dang Quanfu raises one and a half, and Yu Jinglian raises a large mule. Each person averages two rooms. Zhang Jinxiu, with a family of eight, still has 24 rooms and more than 40 mu of good land. Feng Tingkui and Dang Mingfeng each still average eight mu of good land. The landlord feudal forces in this village still occupy an advantage in the economy. Before the movement, the 130 poor peasant households in the village had a total of 1,172.5 mu of land, which increased to 1,902 mu after the movement. Last year's major movement struggled out a total of 1,414 mu of land, and the poor peasant class was divided a total of 730 mu. The poor peasants, a total of 468 people, now average slightly more than four mu per person. The poor peasants now have a total of 523 houses (including 109 newly built), and the village struggled out a total of 182 houses (161 were demolished). Including the new mud houses built by the poor peasants this year, each person averages slightly more than one room. Sixty-nine households in the village are immediately requesting a solution to the housing problem. This year, all the poor peasants harvested a total of 155,850 jin of grain. After paying 23,000 jin of public grain, 50 households will not receive grain this spring. Last year's major movement struggled out a total of 34,000 jin of grain, and the poor peasants were only divided 13,000 jin. A total of 20 cattle and 8 mules were struggled out, and the poor peasants only received 15 cattle. A total of 21 carts were struggled out, and the poor peasants only received 4. A total of 50 pieces of plows, harrows, drills, etc., were struggled out, and the poor peasants only received 15 pieces. Now, the 130 poor peasant households have a total of 31 cattle, 23 plows, 17 harrows, 14 drills, and 6 carts.

　　地主好地好生活贫雇缺地还挨饿
  　企之北召林土地改革不彻底
    【冀南消息】企之北召林村土地改革还差的很远，地主还是好房好地好生活，贫农是缺房少地还挨饿。民国三十四年民主斗争时，这村没有发动。三十五年开展了“雇佃贫运动”，把地主富农削弱了一下。去年大动还是很不彻底。全村共三百五十户，有地主三十八户，只斗了二十户。富农三十六户，只割了十五户尾巴，并且有一半斗的很不彻底，全部都留了中农以上生活，每人都平均四亩地以上。如程德贵、冯老粗、徐贵每人还平均七亩地；被斗户还住着很多好房。于老德、张景春都是八口人，都还有二十间瓦房。于廷元、于廷杰还是原来的瓦房。徐怀还是一进二的院子。乔日章的房子斗出了，有人主张拆，他又拿钱低价换回一部分。地主被斗后，生活根本没变。如乔日章、乔日省、程德贵、张景春、徐贵、马书明等都还喂着牛，徐德学、徐金海斗后比斗前吃穿还好。全村斗了三十多户，只有两户斗出银元，地下宝全没搞出来。这村于家地主从明朝就是财主，还住着好房，浮财斗的也很轻，地下宝更没有问。斗争时于廷佐跑了，事后骑着车子，穿的阔阔的，在街上大摇大摆，说他在公家医院，和什么公安局长麻芳林是换贴来吓唬群众。因此别的被斗地主也大大抬头。漏网地主富农廿九户（他们现下分家计卅九户），共二百零九人，还有好地一千二百亩，每人平均六亩，都喂着牛。徐金镶喂着两头大牛，党全福喂着个半，于敬连喂着大骡，每人平均房子两间。张尽修八口人，还有房子二十四间，有好地四十多亩。冯廷奎、党明凤每人还平均好地八亩。这村地主封建势力在经济上还占着优势。全村一百三十户贫农，运动前共有地一千一百七十二亩五分，运动后增到一千九百零二亩。去年大动共斗出地一千四百一十四亩，贫农阶层共分了七百三十亩。贫农共四百六十八人，每人现在平均四亩稍多。现在贫农共有房子五百二十三间（内新盖一百零九间），全村共斗出一百八十二间房，（拆了一百六十一间），连贫农今年新盖土房子，每人平均一间稍多。全村马上要求解决房子问题的有六十九户。全体贫农今年共收粮食一五五八五○斤，除缴公粮二三○○○斤外，有五十户接不到今年春天。去年大动共斗出粮食三四○○○斤，贫农只分了一三○○○斤。共斗出牛二十头、骡八头，贫农只分到牛十五头。共斗出大车二十一辆，贫农只分到四辆。共斗出犁、耙、耧等五十件，贫农只分到十五件。现在一百三十户贫农，共有牛三十一头，犁二十三件，耙十七件，耧十四件，大车六辆。
