Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: According to a Nanning dispatch in the Hong Kong-based "Masses Weekly": The people's armed forces of Guangxi Province have spread throughout the entire territory. From Xing'an and Quanxian in the north, to Longzhou and Pingxiang in the south, from Huaiji and Rongxian in the east, to Xilong, Zhenbian, Jingde, Baise, Jingxi, Dongtian, and Guode in the west, popular uprisings are erupting everywhere. The Guode people's armed forces have cut off the Jiang bandit's transportation artery, the highway from Yongning to Baise, and the water transportation on the You River. Automobiles and small steamers have been unable to pass for many days. The people's armed forces in Yongchun and Hengxian in the lower reaches of the Yong River have also cut off another important water transportation route of the Jiang bandits, the Yong (ning) to Wu (zhou) line, and steamers have been unable to pass for half a month. The people's armed forces in Shangsi and Sui in southern Guangxi are also actively operating, seriously threatening the Jiang bandit's transportation line from Longzhou to Nanning. Even in Wutang, Sanguan and other places near Yongning, the former provincial capital of Guangxi, people's armed forces have appeared, and the Jiang bandits in the city often announce martial law in a panic. In order to suppress the growing people's armed forces, the Jiang bandits do not hesitate to withdraw two regiments of Guangxi troops from the front to return to Guangxi, and cooperate with the province's security corps and police corps to carry out large-scale massacres of the people, and restore the landlord armed militia organizations of ten years ago. In Guode, Tiandong, Shanglin and other places, the number of innocent people killed cannot be counted. Villages in the Taoxu area of Hengxian have been razed to the ground. Guilin shot eleven so-called bandit suspects in one day. Under the guise of "cooperating in suppressing bandits," the Jiang bandits have formulated "emergency security fee conscription measures," extorting 24 billion Jiang coins from seven cities including Wuzhou, Liuzhou, Yongning, Guilin, and Guixian, coupled with the heavy exploitation of land taxes, county public grain, and township public grain, and this year's poor harvest, the people of Guangxi are almost unable to survive, which has provided extremely favorable conditions for the development of the people's armed forces.

　　广西农民没法活下去
  　人民武装遍布全省
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据香港群众周刊南宁通讯：桂省人民武装已遍布全境。北自兴安、全县，南达龙州、凭祥，东起怀集、容县，西至西隆、镇边、敬德、百色、靖西、东田、果德等地，民变蜂起。果德人民武装已将蒋匪交通干线邕宁至百色的公路及右江水上交通切断，汽车及小汽船已多日无法通过。邕江下游永淳、横县的人民武装，又将蒋匪另一水上交通要道邕（宁）梧（州）线切断，汽船已半月无法通行。桂南上思、绥的人民武装亦积极活动，严重威胁着蒋匪自龙州至南宁的交通线，甚至桂蒋匪前省会邕宁附近五塘、三官等地亦出现人民武装，城内蒋匪常常慌慌张张的宣布戒严。为了镇压日益壮大的人民武装，蒋匪不惜从前方抽调两团桂系军队返广西，协同全省保安队、保警队大规模屠杀人民，并恢复十年前的地主武装民团组织。在果德、田东、上林等地，无辜人民被杀者无法统计。横县陶墟一带乡村已被夷为平地。桂林在一天内就枪毙了十一名所谓匪犯的嫌疑分子。蒋匪在“配合剿匪”的幌子下定出了“紧急保安费征借办法”，向梧州、柳州、邕宁、桂林、贵县等七城市敲榨蒋币二百四十亿元，再加上田赋、县公粮、乡公粮重重苛杂的榨取与今年的歉收，广西人民几已无法生活下去，这就使人民武装的发展获得了极有利的条件。
