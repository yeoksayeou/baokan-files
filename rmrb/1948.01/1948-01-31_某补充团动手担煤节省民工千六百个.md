(Taihang News) After a recent period of political education, a replenishment regiment of a certain brigade immediately launched a military training competition. In order to ensure the smooth completion of the military training plan, put the slogan of "supporting the government and cherishing the people" into practical action, cultivate soldiers' labor concepts, and improve their own food, they took three days out of the intense military training to carry coal from a place more than a hundred miles away from their station. Prior to this, thorough mobilization was carried out in each battalion and company through large and small meetings, and the entire regiment was swept up in a coal-carrying upsurge. A total of 1,182 people participated for three days, carrying back more than 50,000 catties of coal, saving more than 2.8 million yuan according to the market price at the time, and saving more than 1,600 civilian labor days. In this coal-carrying effort, many heroic models emerged. Comrade Zhao Fugui of the Fourth Battalion carried 80 catties himself and explained to other comrades, "Aren't we, the People's Liberation Army, still carrying things the same way when we are civilians at home? Besides, this is also to improve our lives, so we have to do a good job." Comrade Bai Shouchun of the Fifth Company of the Second Battalion has always been active in his work, and this time he was even more energetic in carrying coal, carrying 54 catties. Every time they arrived at a station, they took the initiative to find houses, cook meals, and borrow things. After returning first, he went to pick up others. The Third Squad Leader of the Second Platoon of the First Battalion carried coal at the front, singing songs and shouting slogans to encourage everyone's morale during breaks. Battalion Commander Zhang Xiaotian of the Second Battalion was sick himself, but he personally went to pick up the soldiers and carried for them. The soldiers reflected, "The advantage of the People's Liberation Army is here, the leaders work the same way as us, truly sharing blessings and working together." Squad Leader Qin Longshan of the Recuperation Company has always been a good comrade. This time, he carried 75 catties and promptly boosted everyone's morale, successfully completing the task. After this coal-carrying effort, the soldiers' labor concepts were improved, and many difficulties in their lives were resolved. (Gao Kui, Qi Yun, Jing Zhong, Chen Sheng)
