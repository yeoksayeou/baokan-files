    Our Border Region government has been reorganized! This is a big deal. Chairman Yang tells us: the old government had shortcomings, government cadres had old society bureaucratic habits, the government's organization wasn't about putting the right people in place to do what the people needed, but rather a framework learned from the Kuomintang. In the end, the things the people wanted to do, the government either couldn't do or couldn't do well. Many of the government cadres came from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds, and they had landlord and rich peasant ideas, not being of one mind with us peasants. For example, when it came to emancipation, the government didn't offer us much help. Although the government put in effort on the matter of reasonable burden, there are still many places where it is unfairly implemented.
    This reorganization of the government is for the convenience of distributing land and fighting Chiang Kai-shek. We will establish positions for those who can do what the people need. Government cadres should act as farmhands for the people and not put on airs of authority. Government decisions should be made based on the opinions of the peasant representatives and poor and landless peasants. The government will do two things well this year: The first is to fairly distribute land. The second is to reasonably share the burden. From now on, if we peasants have any difficulties, we can directly raise them with the government, or we can raise them with the peasant representatives.

    咱们的边区政府改组了！这是一件大事情。杨主席转告咱们说：过去的政府有缺点，政府干部有旧社会的官僚习气，政府的组织不是看老百姓需要做什么摆上什么人，是从国民党那里学的一套架子。闹了半天，老百姓要办的事，政府有的办不了，有的办不好。政府里的干部地主富农出身的很多，他们有地主富农思想，跟咱们农民不是一心。比如闹翻身这件事，政府给咱出的主意就不多。合理负担政府虽然费过力气，但到现在还有好多地方办的不公道。
    这回改组政府，是为了分土地和打老蒋的方便，老百姓需要什么样办事的人，就设什么样的办事人。政府干部要给老百姓当长工，不能摆官架。政府办事做决定要听农代会和贫雇农的话。政府今年要办好两件事：第一件是平分土地。第二件是合理负担。咱们农民今后有啥困难，可以直接给政府提，也可以给农代会提。
