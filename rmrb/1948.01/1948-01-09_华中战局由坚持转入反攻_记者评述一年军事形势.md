Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th: This reporter from the Central China Branch commented on the military struggle situation in Central China over the past year, saying: "The military struggle in Central China over the past year has progressed from victorious perseverance to victorious counter-offensive."

　　At the end of 1946, the Central China Liberated Area, which threatened the heart of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, was completely behind enemy lines. The enemy concentrated up to twenty regular army brigades, plus security forces, totaling 200,000 men, to conduct a brutal and inhumane comprehensive "encirclement and suppression" of this area. Their deployment was as follows: the southern line used Taixing, Taizhou, Jingjiang, Rugao, Nantong, Qidong, Haimen and other places along the Yangtze River in central Jiangsu as strongholds; the northern line used Donghai, Guanyun, Shuyang, Suqian and other places south of the Longhai Railway as strongholds; the central line used Siyang, Huaiyin, Huai'an, Baoying, Gaoyou, and Qintong along the Grand Canal as strongholds; and the western line used the area west of the Grand Canal and east of the Jinpu Railway in northern and southern Huai as strongholds, cooperating with each other to repeatedly encircle and attack, attempting to achieve the conspiracy of completely controlling Central China. They also implemented the "Three Alls" policy, attempting to exterminate all of our people. In total, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits slaughtered more than 40,000 people, raped more than 100,000 women, and burned and looted countless properties in Central China over the past year. But the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' failure lies here, because they do not want the people, they want to kill all the people, while the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army protect the people and help the people to turn over, so wherever the Chiang Kai-shek army burns and kills, the flames of people's guerrilla warfare will burn.

　　From January to March 1947, large-scale guerrilla warfare unfolded throughout Central China, from the Longhai Railway in the north to the Yangtze River in the south, and from the Jinpu Railway in the west. Even children and old women were involved in the struggle. Chen, a 70-year-old grandmother in the Huai'an border area, performed the heroic act of sacrificing her son and destroying her house in order to rescue nine guerrillas. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits concentrated their forces to "encircle and suppress" our central area, we immediately inserted ourselves into the enemy's heart, sweeping away their old nests, and successively annihilated more than 9,300 enemies along the Huai(an)-Lian(shui) line and in Nantong, Haimen and other places. At the same time, mass political offensives were combined with anti-conscription, anti-taxation, anti-burning and killing, and anti-rape, and movements such as "torch parades," "wiping out black spots," "stubborn family meetings," and "writing letters to Chiang Kai-shek soldiers" were launched to win over and disintegrate more than 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits. However, due to the disparity in strength between the enemy and us at that time, we did encounter great difficulties in persisting: there was a stronghold every two or three miles in the "encirclement and suppression" area, and the highway bunkers were sealed off layer by layer. When the troops from northern and southern Huai penetrated deep behind the Chiang Kai-shek lines, they were followed and "pursued and suppressed" by eight regiments of enemies, eating only one meal a day and night, fighting several times a day and marching hundreds of miles at night, but not only were they not scattered by the enemy, but they also annihilated more than 6,000 enemies. Therefore, although the Chiang Kai-shek bandits occupied some of our areas in these three months, they could not extinguish our vital forces. At the end of March and the beginning of April, the enemy concentrated more than 60,000 troops from the 49th Division, the 4th Division, and local bandits to "encircle and suppress" the area south of the Hai(an)-Tai(zhou) line and Baoying, Gaoyou, Jiangdu, Qintong and other places along the Grand Canal, and advanced towards our central areas such as Xinghua and north of Dongtai, but just as they were being blocked by the flames of guerrilla warfare, the iron fist of our main force had already struck into the Hai(an)-Tai(zhou) line, captured the strong stronghold of Libao, and annihilated more than 2,700 men of the 49th Division. And when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were in a hurry to transfer reinforcements to the Hai(an)-Tai(zhou) line, our main force annihilated an enemy regiment at Dazhongji and captured the important town of Baiju on the Tong(zhou)-Yu(tai) road, smashing the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' comprehensive "encirclement and suppression" of central Jiangsu. Our local armed forces took advantage of the enemy's chaos to launch extensive and comprehensive attacks, and the mass self-defense movement was also in full swing. Rugao, Taixing and other counties broke out in heroic acts of 100,000 people surrounding strongholds, and Rudong and other counties launched the "one person killed, ten thousand people avenge" movement, and the masses in the border areas also launched anti-donation and anti-cutting green struggle. In northern Jiangsu, just as the enemy concentrated its forces to "encircle and suppress" the counties south of the Longhai Railway, our main force and local armed forces jointly launched a fierce attack on their flanks, capturing many strongholds on the Shu(yang)-Huai(yin) line and the Lian(shui)-Xin(Anzhen) line, annihilating nearly a thousand enemies, and the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" plan was completely shattered. From April to mid-July, our annihilation of bandits increased to more than 20,000. We established a favorable situation of persisting behind enemy lines and recovered large areas of lost territory, while the enemy began to decline.

　　From August, our army turned to strategic counter-offensive, becoming a flank of the southern counter-offensive army. On August 12, the Liberation Army recovered Yeting City in one fell swoop, annihilating more than 7,000 bandits and disrupting the entire deployment of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' "encirclement and suppression" of Central China. The comprehensive "encirclement and suppression" had turned into a complete standstill, and even the struggling "encirclement and suppression" and "sweeping" were limited to local areas and were merely economic plundering. Then our army swept north and south, captured Xin'anzhen and other places in October, and returned south on November 31 to recapture Libao, sweeping away all strongholds within 150 miles of the line. Local armed guerrillas everywhere coordinated their attacks, successively removing more than 70 strongholds, annihilating more than 9,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the entire battle. The peasants who had turned over and been persecuted by the enemy's repeated "encirclement and suppression" shouted in unison: "The counter-offensive has begun, the day of revenge has arrived!" Millions of people acted together, took up all their hoes and rakes, and leveled all the traffic blockades to the ground. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' defense system in central Jiangsu was smashed to pieces, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits shrank into isolated strongholds, panicking. At the same time, our troops from northern Huai successively captured Siyang County and dozens of large and small strongholds, recovering large areas of lost territory in Suining, Siling Sui, Ding Fengjia, Siyang, and Wuhe counties, which had been lost for a year, liberating a population of one million. Southern Huai has also penetrated into the Tianchang area south of Hongze Lake and is developing in depth. From August to the present five months, our annihilation of bandits has jumped to 50,000.

　　Through a year of heroic fighting by the army and the people, we have paid a heavy price and achieved brilliant results. A total of 82,400 Chiang Kai-shek bandits were annihilated, and 118 artillery pieces and 21,645 machine guns and rifles were captured. Now we control eight tenths of the countryside and two thirds of the towns, restoring the situation before the "encirclement and suppression." The reporter finally pointed out: "In the coming year, the army and people of Central China will complete the comprehensive large-scale counter-offensive mission in the Central China region, recover all towns and cities, and completely and thoroughly eliminate all Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

　　华中战局由坚持转入反攻
  　记者评述一年军事形势
    【新华社华东七日电】华中分社记者此次评述华中一年来军事斗争形势称：一年来华中的军事斗争是从胜利坚持到胜利反攻。
    一九四六年底威胁蒋匪心脏的华中解放区已完全处于敌后。敌集中兵力最多时达正规军二十个旅，连保安队等达二十万人，对这一地区进行毫无人性，惨绝人性的全面“清剿”。其部署是：南线以苏中沿江的泰兴、泰州、靖江、如皋、南通、启东、海门等为据点，北线以陇海线以南之东海、灌云、沭阳、宿迁等为据点，中线以运河线之泗阳、淮阴、淮安、宝应、高邮、溱潼等为据点，西线以运河线以西津浦线以东之淮南淮北为据点，互相配合，反复包围合击，妄图达到完全控制华中之阴谋。且进行三光政策，欲灭绝我全体人民。总计蒋匪一年来在华中屠杀人民四万余，强奸妇女十万余，烧毁房屋及掠劫财物则不计其数。但蒋匪的失败也就在这里，因为他不要人民，要杀尽人民，而共产党解放军则保护人民，帮助人民翻身，因此蒋军烧杀到哪里，人民游击战的烽火就燃烧到哪里。
    一九四七年一月至三月，北起陇海、南抵长江、西至津浦整个华中全面展开了规模巨大的游击战争，连小孩和老太婆都卷入了斗争。淮安边区七十岁陈老奶奶为了营救九个游击队员，作了舍子毁屋的壮举。当蒋匪集中兵力“清剿”我中心区时，我即插入敌心脏，扫除其老窠，先后在淮（安）涟（水）线，南通、海门等地歼敌九千三百余。同时群众性的政治攻势与反抽丁、反捐税、反烧杀、反奸淫等结合，开展“火炬游行”，“擦黑点”，“顽属会议”及“写蒋军家书”等运动，争取瓦解蒋匪达三千余人。但由于当时敌我力量悬殊，在坚持中我确也碰到极大困难：“清剿”区中二三里路即有一个据点，公路碉堡层层封锁。淮北、淮南子弟兵深入蒋后，曾被八个团敌人跟着“追剿”，一天一夜只吃一顿饭，日战数次，夜行百里，但不仅没有被敌人打散，而且歼敌六千余名。因此这三个月中蒋匪虽然占了我某些地区，但却不能扑灭我有生力量。三月尾四月初敌人集中了四十九师、四师及土顽等六万余兵力向海泰、海＠线以南及运河沿线之宝应、高邮、江都、溱潼等地“清剿”，并向我兴化、东台以北等中心地区跃进，但正当其被阻于游击烽火时，我主力的铁拳已打入海＠线拿下强大据点李堡，歼敌四十九师二千七百余人。而当蒋匪慌忙调援海＠线时，我主力又于大中集歼敌一个团，并克通榆路上白驹重镇；将蒋匪对苏中的全面“清剿”打得七零八落。我地方武装更乘敌慌乱之际，广泛的全面出击，群众性自卫运动亦如火如荼，如皋、泰兴等县都爆发了十万群众包围据点的壮举，如东等县展开“一人被杀，万人复仇”运动，边沿区群众亦纷纷展开反捐、反割青斗争。在苏北，正当敌集中兵力“清剿”陇海路以南各县时，我主力及地武乃联合猛击其侧背，连克沭（阳）淮（阴）线及涟（水）新（安镇）线之据点多处歼敌近千，敌之“清剿”计划遂全部粉碎。自四月到七月中，我歼匪增至二万余人。确立了坚持敌后的有利形势，恢复了大块失地，而敌人则开始走下坡路。
    从八月起，我军转入战略反攻，成为南线反攻大军的一个侧翼。八月十二日解放军一举收复叶挺城，歼匪七千余人还把蒋匪对华中“清剿”的整个部署打得零落不堪，全面“清剿”已变成全面停顿，就是还有一些挣扎性的“清剿”“扫荡”，亦仅限于局部地区，并且仅属经济性的掠夺罢了。接着我大军即向南北扫荡，十月攻克新安镇等地，十一月三十一日回师南下再克李堡，并扫平该线一百五十里内所有据点，各地地方武装游击队到处配合出击，接连拔除据点七十余，全役共歼蒋匪九千余人。被敌反复“清剿”所逼害的翻身农民此时众口一声喊着：“反攻了，复仇的日子到了”，千万人一齐行动，拿起所有的锄头、钉耙，把所有交通封锁线平毁一光，敌人在苏中的防御体系、被打得稀烂，蒋匪龟缩孤立据点，惶惶不安。同时，我淮北子弟兵连克泗县县城及大小据点数十处，恢复沦陷一年之睢宁、泗灵睢、盯凤嘉、泗县、五河等县大块失地，解放人口达一百万。淮南也已插入洪泽湖以南天长一带，并向纵深发展。从八月到现在的五个月，我歼匪跃至五万人。
    经过一年来军民的英勇战斗，我们付出了重大的代价，而获得了辉煌的战绩。共歼蒋匪八万二千四百余人，缴获各种炮一百一十八门，机步枪二万一千六百四十五支。现我控制乡村十分之八，市镇三分之二，恢复到“清剿”以前的态势。记者最后指出：今后“年华中军民将在华中地区完成全面的大举反攻任务，收复一切城镇，干净彻底消灭一切蒋匪。
