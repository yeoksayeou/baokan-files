　　Communication and Exchange
　　No. 3
    Recently, various branch offices and correspondents have made great efforts to expose various errors in work and phenomena that violate the interests of the people, which is very good. However, it should be brought to everyone's attention in a timely manner: our criticism and exposure of various errors does not equate to promoting one-sidedness and exaggeration. In the past, when commendation was advocated, the news from various places was all good. Now? Everything is bad again. We believe that this is still not a pragmatic style, and doing so will develop the "Kremlin style" (客里空作风). We require all branch offices and correspondents to earnestly proceed from reality, to be right if it is right, and wrong if it is wrong, to be honest, not to boast, not to steal, not to feign, to promote the spirit of being responsible to the people and seeking truth from facts, to expose errors, correct errors, and promote achievements and advantages. All erroneous things, we must bravely criticize from a class standpoint. On the other hand, all good achievements that benefit the people, good work styles and models for serving the people, we must also commend. When we report on a work, we must also measure its advantages and disadvantages from the standpoint of the interests of hired and poor laborers, in order to better transform cadres and improve work.

　　通讯往来
  　第三号
    最近各分社及通讯员努力揭发了各种工作上的错误及各种违犯人民利益的现象，是很好的；但是应当引起大家及时注意：我们批评及揭发各种错误，并不等于助长片面性和夸大，过去提倡表扬了，各地来的消息便一切都是好的。现在呢？又是一切都是坏的了。我们认为这仍然不是实事求是的作风，这样做，又会发展“客里空作风”。我们要求各分社及通讯员认真从实际出发，对是对，非是非，老老实实，不吹不偷不装，发扬对人民负责、实事求是的精神，揭发错误，纠正错误，发扬成绩和优点。一切错误的东西，我们都要站在阶级立场上勇于批判，另一方面，一切于人民有利的好成绩，为人民服务好的作风和表率，我们同样要加以表扬，我们报导一件工作，同样也要站在雇贫利益的立场上衡量其优缺点，以便更好的改造干部改进工作。
