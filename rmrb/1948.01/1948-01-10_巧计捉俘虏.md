　　Clever Plan to Capture Prisoners
　　When Wang Mingde saw that Wang Sangfu was wounded in the leg, he quickly ran over, carried him on his back, and ran to a cave under the east city wall of Yuncheng. Suddenly, he saw six or seven bright bayonets inside. Wang Mingde loudly asked, "Which unit are you from?" The reply was: 369th Regiment. The resourceful and quick-witted Wang Mingde was startled, but immediately came up with a plan. He shouted loudly, "Brothers, don't move! The People's Liberation Army is outside laying explosives! We won't survive if we don't surrender our guns!" This frightened the enemy into trembling. One fellow got up and said, "Please contact them quickly, and we will surrender our guns." Wang Mingde ran out and shouted loudly, "Comrades of the 7th Company, don't fire! They are our own people." He returned and gave the order: "Quickly put the guns in a pile!" The enemy surrendered their guns to Wang Mingde one by one. They also moved a telephone and more than 8,000 rounds of ammunition out of the cave. The enemy asked Wang Mingde to go out and make contact again. Wang Mingde went out without shouting or saying anything. He only brought back squad leader Xing Shiru. At this time, the twelve enemies realized that Wang Mingde was a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, but since they had already surrendered their guns, they had no choice but to obediently become prisoners.

　　巧计捉俘虏
    王明德看见王桑福腿上负了伤，他就赶紧跑到跟前背起来就跑，跑到运城东城墙下一个窑洞跟前，忽然看见里面有六七支明晃晃的刺刀，王明德就大声问道：“你们是哪一部分？”回答是：三六九团，机智灵活的王明德吃了一惊，马上计上心来，就大声说：“弟兄们不要动弹，外面的人民解放军在下炸药哩！不缴枪咱就活不成了”，把敌人吓的发抖。有一个家伙爬起来说：“请你赶快连络一下，我们就缴枪。”王明德就跑出来放大嗓子说：“七连的同志们不要打了，都是自己人。”返回来就下命令：“快把枪放在一块”！敌人就一支一支的把枪缴给王明德，还有电话机和八千多发子弹也往窑洞内搬出来了。敌人又叫王明德出去连络，王明德出去没有叫喊，也没有说啥，只把组长邢世如一人引来，这时候十二个敌人才明白了王明德就是人民解放军，可是枪都缴了，只好服服贴贴的当了俘虏。（幕兵）
