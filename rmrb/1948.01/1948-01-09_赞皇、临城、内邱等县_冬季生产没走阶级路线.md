Zanhuang, Lincheng, Neiqiu and other counties
Winter production did not follow the class line

[Jixi News] The Taihang Prefectural Commissioner's Office recently convened county magistrates, chairmen of the Relief Associations, and directors of County Cooperative Societies to inspect winter production. Investigations from various locations revealed that many poor and hired peasants were still suffering from hunger and cold:

(1) Who exactly is experiencing the disaster? In the past, the leadership in Zanhuang was not very clear on this. According to an investigation in Nanxule, there are 12 poor peasant households with 34 people, with 8.76 *shi* of grain. Each person has an average of only 2.57 *dou*. There are 13 middle peasant households (one old middle peasant) with 66 people, with 44.2 *shi* of grain. Each person has an average of 6.7 *dou*. In Dawangbang, an old area in Jingxing with serious disaster conditions, 17 old middle peasant households with 47 people have an average of 1.34 *shi* of grain per person, which, at a daily consumption of 0.5 *jin*, can last for one year and three months. 71 new middle peasant households with 207 people who benefited from rent reduction have an average of 3.5 *dou* of grain per person, which can only last for four months. 72 poor peasant households with 231 people who just turned over have an average of 2.87 *dou* of grain per person, which can only last for three months. Zhang Village in the Fifth District of Neiqiu is a village with a harvest of 100% this year. During recruitment, it was discovered that the militia captain currently has nothing to eat. Two other militiamen who signed up with him have not yet received their cotton-padded clothes. These facts show that the disaster is most serious for poor and hired peasants.

(2) Who exactly is facing the greatest production difficulties, and who lacks the ability to overcome the famine through production? Looking at the ownership of textile tools in Buyao Village, Lincheng: out of 149 households in the village, there are 55 weaving machines. 64 poor peasant households have only 9 machines, averaging more than 7 households per machine. 68 middle peasant households have 43 machines, averaging 1.5 machines per household. 8 rich peasant households have 3 machines, averaging one machine per 2.5 households. In Shicheng Village, out of 278 households, 57 are poor and hired peasants. Out of 58 weaving machines in the village, poor and hired peasants own only 9. According to a survey of 28 poor and hired peasant households, 18 households lack textile capital. This shows that poor and hired peasants lack production tools and capital in winter production and lack the ability to overcome the famine.

(3) Has past lending helped poor and hired peasants? In Nanhui Mountain, Lincheng, 240,000 yuan was loaned, and five households that were struggled against received 100,000 yuan. In Buyao Village, two old middle peasant households borrowed 130,000 yuan, while 15 poor peasant households borrowed 80,000 yuan. In Beiyangjiao, Zanhuang, the organization of poor and hired peasants to inspect loans found that three households that were struggled against borrowed 25,000 yuan, while only 16 out of 59 poor peasant households borrowed 130,000 yuan, and 23 middle peasant households borrowed 200,500 yuan. In the past, emphasis was placed on combining with idle capital. This year, Chengdi Village, Lincheng, borrowed money to buy 17 mules, but not a single poor or hired peasant bought one. The purpose of lending in Shahe emphasized textiles and transportation, but some poor and hired peasants could not engage in textiles and transportation and could not get loans to buy peanut, sweet potato, or tofu seedlings. In Zanhuang's Fourth District, loan procedures had time limits, required guarantors and mortgages, etc., so poor and hired peasants did not dare to borrow. Cadres were afraid that they would not be able to repay, so they did not dare to lend to them. This shows that our lending violated the principle of helping poor and hired peasants.

　　赞皇、临城、内邱等县
    冬季生产没走阶级路线
    【冀西消息】太行专署最近召集各县县长救联主席、县联社社长检查冬季生产：从各地调查事实发现雇贫在生活上，还有不少人正在挨饿受冻：
    （一）究竟谁有灾荒？赞皇过去领导上是不很明确的，根据调查南徐乐有贫农十二户三十四人，现有粮八石七斗六升，每人平均只二斗五升七。中农十三户（一老中农）六十六人，现有粮四十四石二斗，每人平均六斗七。井陉灾情严重的老区大王帮旧中农十七户四十七人，每人平均粮一石三斗四，以日吃五合计，能吃一年零三个月，减租后的新中农七十一户二百零七人，每人平均粮三斗五，只能吃四个月，才翻身的贫农七十二户二百三十一人，每人平均粮二斗八升七合，能吃三个月。内邱五区张村今年是十成年景的村庄，在参军中发现民兵队长现下就没吃的，还有两个民兵与他一块报名参军，还未穿上棉衣。而仅从这些事实看出贫雇灾荒是最严重的。
    （二）究竟谁生产中最困难，谁没有生产渡荒能力？从临城补腰村纺织工具的占有上看；全村一百四十九户五十五张织布机，贫农六十四户只有九张，平均七户多一张，中农六十八户四十三张机，平均一户半一张机，富农八户三张。平均二户半一机。石城村二百七十八户，贫雇五十七户，全村五十八张织机，贫雇只有九张。又据二十八户贫雇会上调查，就有十八户没纺织资本。这说明了贫雇在冬季生产中，是缺乏生产工具及资本，没有渡荒能力。
    （三）检查过去贷款是否扶助了贫雇？临城南辉山贷款二十四万，五个被斗户就贷了十万；补腰村老中农二户贷了十三万，贫农十五户贷八万。赞皇北羊角组织贫雇检查贷款中发现被斗户三户贷二万五千元，贫农五十九户只十六户贷了十三万，中农二十三户贷了二十万零五百元。过去强调结合游资，临城澄底村今年贷款买骡子十七匹，而贫雇没买到一个。沙河贷款用途，强调纺织运输，而有些贫雇不能进行纺织运输，想买花生红薯豆腐秧却贷不到款。赞皇四区贷款手续上有限期、找保抵押等，贫雇不敢贷，干部怕还不起，也不敢贷给，这说明了我们贷款是违背了扶助贫雇原则的。　　　　　　　　　　（紫云、芸阁）
