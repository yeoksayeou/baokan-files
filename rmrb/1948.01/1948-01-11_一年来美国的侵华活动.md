U.S. Aggression Against China Over the Past Year
    ·Wang Zongyi·
    Over the past year, due to the frantic aggression of U.S. imperialism and the frantic betrayal of the country by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT-controlled areas have become further colonized.
    Militarily. The U.S. Military Advisory Group in China has gradually developed into the highest military supervision agency over the Chiang bandit-controlled areas. Since September of last year, the personnel of the Advisory Group have formally controlled and supervised the work of various departments of the Chiang bandit's highest military institution, the Ministry of National Defense. During the period when Wedemeyer came to China, the group also obtained the right to train the Chiang bandit army and is planning to obtain full command of the Chiang bandit army through the establishment of a joint staff. As early as the beginning of the civil war, the United States, through the U.S. military officer corps sent to the Chiang army troops, participated in the command of the Chiang army in some areas. The Chiang-US "Naval Agreement" signed on December 8 last year established the U.S. imperialists' regulatory power over the Chiang bandit navy. In addition, the U.S. imperialists have obtained from Chiang Kai-shek the land, sea, and air force bases in Qingdao, Xi'an, Tianshui, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Dihua, Huangpu, Sanzao Island, Yulin Port, and Keelung, Kaohsiung, Taipei, Taichung, and Pingtung in Taiwan, thus forming a network of U.S. aggressive bases in China in the air, sea, and land. The "note" of the Chiang bandit Foreign Ministry on October 17 allowing the U.S. military to be stationed in China formally gave Chinese territory to the United States as a U.S. troop garrison. The U.S. Military Advisory Group, U.S. troops stationed, plus the U.S. military base network in China, constitute a complete military supervision system of the United States over the Chiang bandit-controlled areas.
    Secondly, economically. In terms of finance, in early September, the American Young took office as advisor to the Chiang bandit "Stabilization Fund Committee," obtaining the regulatory power over the Chiang bandit's financial foreign exchange. The Chiang-US "Relief Agreement" of October 27 determined the U.S. supervisory power over the Chiang bandit's production, trade, commercial distribution, and finance, and Washington has established a "China Relief Committee" to be responsible for implementing this supervisory power. In November, Chiang Kai-shek also gave the customs sovereignty to the United States as collateral for obtaining U.S. loans. In terms of industry, in August last year, Chiang bandit Executive President Zhang Qun's statement on "foreign investment and technical cooperation in China" allowed the United States to invest in all light and heavy industrial sectors in the KMT-controlled areas, strengthening and expanding the right of American monopoly capitalists to monopolize Chinese industry. In terms of agriculture, the Chiang bandit government, in order to implement its American master's colonial production plan of "raw materials China," passed a "Sino-American Agricultural Cooperation Plan for the 37th Year" in November last year, from agricultural research, agricultural extension, fisheries research, to agricultural education and land surveying, all agricultural sovereignty was betrayed to U.S. imperialism. The United States has also decided to reorganize the Chiang bandit agricultural institutions so that the United States can directly control them. In October, the Chiang bandit authorities, in accordance with U.S. orders, established the "Rehabilitation Affairs Committee" to inherit the work of UNRRA in China, which has become a specialized supervisory agency for the United States to supervise Chinese agriculture after UNRRA. The UNRRA authorities have publicly declared that the "board of directors" of the association, which is presided over by Americans, has the right to implement "supervision" in all aspects of agriculture in the Chiang-controlled areas. As a result of the above-mentioned steps taken by the US-Chiang collusion, the colonial nature of the Chiang-controlled area's economy has become more profound.
    While the United States stepped up its military and economic aggression against China, U.S. imperialism also particularly strengthened its cultural and ideological aggression against China. Its content is to cover up the aggressive true face of U.S. imperialism by various means of despicable and obscene rumors and deceptions. U.S. imperialists are striving to use fabricated concepts such as "Sino-American cooperation" and "one family in the world" as an excuse to strangle China's independence. And they have used the long-bankrupt "anti-communism" smoke screen to spread shameless slanders such as "Soviet ambitions for China" to cover up their aggressive actions against China. The large-scale plunder of China's sovereignty by the United States and the bloody crimes of the United States slaughtering the Chinese people in the hands of Chiang Kai-shek are described as "maintaining China's freedom and independence," and the Chiang family bandits and all American lackeys are portrayed as "patriotic elements," and the true patriotic and democratic elements are slandered as "not understanding the responsibility of being a national," and openly warning the Chinese people that "there is no need to resist foreign aggression now." The die-hard U.S. imperialist, Judd, even publicly called on the Chiang bandit authorities in Nanjing in October to learn from Mussolini and carry out "lies" propaganda to the Chinese people. The "Relief Agreement" specifically stipulates that the Chiang bandit authorities must use all their strength to carry out "full and continuous propaganda about American aid" in order to fool the Chinese national consciousness. In particular, the U.S.-China Education Fund Agreement signed on November 10 decided to establish a "U.S. Education Foundation in China" completely controlled by Americans as the highest supervisory agency for U.S. cultural education to the Chiang bandits, so as to thoroughly transform Chinese education into colonial slave education in accordance with U.S. imperialist viewpoints. The U.S. imperialists were overjoyed because Chiang Kai-shek had completely sold out the sovereignty of Chinese cultural education, believing that this was a "model of understanding" obtained by the United States at a "low price" between it and its lackeys, and that its lackey Chiang Kai-shek actively supported the U.S. imperialist "world education center status" as the "first important step" (U.S. Minneapolis Tribune Morning News editorial).
    In addition to the above three aspects of military, economic, and cultural, the Chiang bandit authorities have also given the supervisory power of Chinese judicial administration to U.S. imperialism. The American Pound took office as advisor to the Chiang bandit Ministry of Justice and Administration at the end of September, responsible for completely transforming China's code. The U.S. Embassy in China has long become the center of U.S. regulatory activities over the Chiang bandit regime, and the embassy's agricultural counselors, cultural specialists, financial counselors, and military counselors directly participate in the Chiang bandit's internal affairs. U.S. imperialism, through its embassy in China, directs every political action of the Chiang bandit authorities. In the past year, the suppression and destruction of the patriotic democratic movement in the Chiang area, the playing of the pseudo-"National Congress," and many other political conspiracies of the Chiang bandit authorities were all carried out under U.S. guidance.
    In the past year, U.S. imperialism has also stepped up its support for Japanese aggression forces as a tool for U.S. aggression against China. In August last year, the United States ordered the Chiang bandit authorities to open trade with Japan, the purpose of which was to make China still a dumping market for Japanese goods and a supplier of raw materials. The Chiang bandit authorities have now decided to send their first and second batches of trade representatives to Japan in order to profit the four major families from the sale of national blood. U.S. imperialism is trying to form a Far East economic group, including its Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and Korean lackeys into one, as a convenient form for the United States to enslave the entire Asia and the Far East, and especially to enslave the Chinese people. The United States has brought Japanese aggression forces back to Taiwan. Under the encouragement of MacArthur, the Japanese warlords have re-issued their arrogant demands for Chinese territory. MacArthur is prepared to make the Japanese warlords re-assume the task of "guarding China."
    The reason why Chiang Kai-shek is so actively selling out national sovereignty at all costs is to exchange for U.S. aid to support his anti-people civil war. The purpose of U.S. imperialism is to exchange China's national sovereignty from Chiang Kai-shek in exchange for U.S. money. However, the greedy and stingy U.S. usurer, its policy is to exchange as much Chinese sovereignty as possible for as little U.S. money as possible. The deeper Chiang Kai-shek's rule crisis becomes, the harsher the conditions for U.S. aid become. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek, the U.S. slave, is selling China more and more cheaply. In order to obtain 27.7 million U.S. dollars of U.S. supplies, Chiang Kai-shek gave the United States all the supervisory power of China's production, trade, commercial distribution, and its finances, and promised to carry out "gratitude" propaganda for the United States. In order to beg for further U.S. assistance, Chiang Kai-shek simply sold out China's customs and completely auctioned off Taiwan, but what the United States continued to give Chiang Kai-shek was only the temporary assistance of a mere 18 million U.S. dollars passed by the U.S. Congress on December 19. Apart from this, what Chiang Kai-shek received from the United States in the past year was the 60 million U.S. dollars of military ammunition loans granted by the U.S. dog, the Canadian government, in September, and a series of U.S. weapons and ammunition sold by the United States, and the seventeen Japanese military factories given in the form of Japanese reparations materials. U.S. financial tycoons believe that selling arms to Chiang Kai-shek is a good deal, which can both make money and slaughter the Chinese people. This is also the reason why U.S. imperialism actively advocates increasing military aid to Chiang. In order to destroy China, U.S. imperialists will never stop or relax their aid to Chiang Kai-shek, and Chiang Kai-shek, in order to exchange U.S. aid to save his life, will sell out China more shamelessly and thoroughly.
    In the face of Chiang Kai-shek's military defeat and his deepening rule crisis, U.S. imperialists have shifted the focus of their aggression against China to South China and Southwest China. While the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary rule in Northeast China, North China, and even Central China is coming to an end, he has sold the rights and interests of the entire South China and Southwest China to the United States as a gift to his American master for continuing to support his dying rule. When Wedemeyer came to China for inspection, he made a thorough inspection of South China and suggested that South China be used as a U.S.-Chiang ruling base. The United States has shown special concern for the form of the political power in South China. Song Ziwen's appointment as chairman of the Chiang bandit Guangdong Province, and then being appointed as director of the Chiang bandit Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, came from the U.S. plan. The purpose of the U.S. collusion with the Chiang bandit authorities to instigate the "peace movement" conspiracy in South China by Song Ziwen and others is also to vainly attempt to maintain the US-Chiang feudal colonial rule in South China. Recently, the investment and inspection of Americans in Guangdong, Hunan and other places, the construction of railways such as Yuehan, Xiang-Gui-Qian, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Chengdu-Chongqing, Sichuan-Kang-Yunnan under the supervision of Americans, and the expansion of the US sea and air base network in South China all show the intensification of American aggression in South China and Southwest China. Related to the US aggression activities in South China is the strengthening of the US forces in Taiwan. Chiang Kai-shek has agreed to the US to completely occupy Taiwan and include it in the US occupation system in Japan.
    But no matter what assistance U.S. imperialism gives to Chiang Kai-shek, or what other struggling steps it takes, the dying fate of US-Chiang rule in China cannot be reversed. The United States once gave Chiang Kai-shek more than 4 billion U.S. dollars in aid, trying to eliminate the Chinese people's democratic independence movement, but the result was Chiang Kai-shek's military defeat and the emergence of a new upsurge in the national anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution in China, which moved Chiang Kai-shek to the edge of the grave. Although U.S. imperialism now seems to have understood that Chiang Kai-shek's army commanded and equipped by the United States is "nothing more than a transshipment personnel of U.S. weapons" (Washington Post), understands that the end result of U.S. aid to Chiang Kai-shek will only be worse than the end result of aid to the Greek reactionaries (New York Herald Tribune), and understands that "neither U.S. money nor U.S. weapons will give Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist war much support" (Associated Press), but U.S. imperialists have no other way but to continue to follow the old path of assisting Chiang Kai-shek and drag Chiang Kai-shek and U.S. rule in China into the grave. As for the great goal of the Chinese people's struggle, it is to completely liberate the whole of China, completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous rule, completely sweep the forces of imperialism out of China, and this infinitely bright day is not far away.

　　一年来美国的侵华活动
    ·王宗一·
    过去一年来，由于美帝国主义的疯狂侵略，和卖国贼蒋介石的疯狂卖国，蒋管区已更进一步地殖民地化。
    在军事上。驻华美国军事顾问团，已逐渐发展为对蒋匪统治区的最高军事监督机关。顾问团人员自去年九月起，正式控制及监督了蒋匪最高军事机构国防部各部门工作。该团在魏德迈来华时期，又取得了对蒋匪陆军的训练权，并正计划经过建立联合参谋部的步骤，获取对蒋匪军队的全部指挥权。早在内战初期，美国即经过其派往蒋军部队中的美军将校干部队，参与了若干地区的蒋军指挥。去年十二月八日签订的蒋美“海军协定”，又确立了美帝国主义对蒋匪海军的监管权。此外，美帝国主义已从蒋介石手中取得青岛、西安、天水、兰州、成都、迪化、黄埔、三灶岛、榆林港以及台湾的基隆、高雄、台北、台中、屏东等陆海空军基地，从而组成了美国在华空中、海上和陆上侵略基地网。十月十七日蒋匪外交部允许美军驻华的“照会”，正式把中国领土送给美国作为美国屯兵场。美国军事顾问团，美国驻军，加上美国在华军事基地网，就构成了美国对蒋匪统治区的整套军事监管体系。
    其次是经济上。财政金融方面，九月初美人杨格就任蒋匪“平准基金委员会”顾问，取得了对蒋匪金融外汇的监督权。十月二十七日的蒋美“救济协定”，确定了美国对于蒋匪生产、贸易、商业分配以及财政的监督权，华盛顿方面已成立“中国救济委员会”，负责执行此项监督权。十一月间蒋介石又把海关主权送给了美国，当作取得美国贷款的抵押品。工业方面，去年八月蒋匪行政院长张群关于“外人来华投资及技术合作”的声明，允许美国投资蒋管区一切轻重工业部门，加强和扩大了美国独占资本家垄断中国工业的权利。农业方面，蒋匪政府为执行其美国主子之“原料中国”殖民地生产计划，已于去年十一月间通过一“三十七年度中美农业合作计划方案”，从农业研究、农业推广、水产研究，直到农业教育、土地测量，全部农业主权，都断送给美国帝国主义。美国并已决定将蒋匪农业机构加以改组，以便美国直接控制。十月间蒋匪当局依照美国命令成立用以继承联总在华工作的“善后事业委员会”，已继联总之后成为美国对中国农业的专门监督机关，联总当局已公开声明由美人参加主持之该会“董事会”，有对蒋管区农业实行各方面“监督”之权利。由于美蒋勾结实行上述各项步骤的结果，蒋管区经济上的殖民地性质，已更加深刻。
    与美国加紧实行军事和经济侵华同时，美帝国主义并特别加强了对于中国的文化思想侵略。其内容，就是以各种卑污下流的造谣欺骗手段，掩饰美帝国主义的侵略真面目。美帝国主义者努力以“中美合作”“天下一家”等杜撰的观念，作为绞杀中国独立的借口。并袭用早已破产了的“反共产主义”烟幕，散布所谓“苏联对中国的野心”等无耻诽谤，掩饰其侵华行动。将美国对中国主权的大肆掠夺，和美国假手蒋介石屠杀中国人民的血腥罪行，描述为“维护中国自由与独立”，将蒋家匪帮及一切美国走狗形容为“爱国分子”，将真正的爱国民主分子诬蔑为“不懂得作国民的责任”，并公然警告中国人民“现在不需要再抵抗外来侵略”。美国死硬帝国主义分子楚德，十月间且曾在南京公开号召蒋匪当局学墨索里尼的样子，向中国人民进行“谎言”宣传。“救济协定中”，特别规定了蒋匪当局必须用一切力量进行“关于美国援助之充分与不断之宣传”，以愚弄中国民族意识。尤其是十一月十日签订的美国对华教育基金协定，决定成立一完全由美人掌握的“美国在华教育基金会”，作为美国对蒋匪文化教育的最高监督机关，以便按照美帝国主义观点，将中国教育彻底改造为殖民地奴隶教育。美帝国主义者因为蒋介石对中国文化教育主权的全部出卖，而喜不自禁，认为这是美国以“低廉之代价”与其走狗间所获得的“谅解之模范”，是其走狗蒋介石积极支持美帝国主义“世界教育中心地位”的“第一重要步骤”（美国密尼亚波利斯论坛晨报社论）。
    除以上军事、经济、文化三方面外，蒋匪当局并已将中国司法行政的监督权送给了美帝国主义。美人庞德已于九月底就任蒋匪司法行政部顾问，负责全部改造中国的法典。驻华美国大使馆，则早已成为美国对蒋匪政权的监管活动中心，大使馆农业参赞、文化专员、财政参赞及军事参赞等，皆直接参与蒋匪内政事务。美帝国主义通过其驻华大使馆，指挥着蒋匪当局的每一个政治行动。过去一年中，蒋匪当局对于蒋区爱国民主运动的镇压摧残，伪“国大”的扮演，以及其他许多政治阴谋，无一不是在美国指导下进行的。
    在过去一年中，美帝国主义并加紧扶植日本侵略势力，作为美国侵华工具。去年八月间美国命令蒋匪当局开放对日贸易，其目的即为使中国照旧成为日本商品的倾销市场和原料供应地。蒋匪当局现已决定将其第一、二批贸易代表派往日本，以便从出卖民族鲜血中，为四大家族牟利。美帝国主义正力图组成远东经济集团，将其中、日、菲、韩走狗包容于一体，作为美国奴役整个亚洲及远东，而特别是奴役中国人民的简便形式，美国已将日本侵略势力重新带到台湾。日本军阀在麦克阿瑟鼓励下，重新发出了对中国领土的狂妄要求。麦克阿瑟已准备使日本军阀重新担负起“警卫中国”的任务。
    蒋介石之所以这样积极的不惜一切的出卖国家主权，是为的换取美国援助，支持其反人民的内战。而美帝国主义的目的，也正是为了以美国金元从蒋介石手中换取中国国家主权。但贪婪而吝啬的美国高利贷者，它所持的政策，是以尽量少的美国钱换取尽量多的中国主权。蒋介石的统治危机愈是加深，美国的援助的条件就愈是苛刻。因此美国奴才蒋介石的出卖中国，也愈来愈廉价。为取得二千七百七十万美元的美国物资，蒋介石一下子就把中国生产、贸易、商业分配及其财政的监督权，全部送给美国帝国主义，并答应为美国进行“感恩”宣传。为乞求美国进一步的援助，蒋介石又干脆出卖了中国的海关，并全部拍卖了台湾，但美国继续给蒋介石的，就只是十二月十九日美国国会所通过的临时援助区区一千八百万美元。除此以外，过去一年中，蒋介石从美国手中所得到的，就是九月间美国走狗加拿大政府所给予的六千万美元军火贷款，和美国连续售给的一些美国武器和军火，以及以日本赔价物资形式给予的十七座日本兵工厂。美国财阀认为出售军火给蒋介石是一个好买卖，既能赚钱，又能屠杀中国人民，这也正是美国帝国主义积极主张增加军事援蒋的原因。美帝国主义者为了灭亡中国，是决不会停止或放松对于蒋介石的援助的，而蒋介石为了换取美国援助救命，将会更无耻更彻底地出卖中国。
    在蒋介石军事失败和其统治危机日益加深的情况下，美帝国主义者已将侵华的重点转向华南和中国西南。汉奸蒋介石在其东北、华北甚至华中的反革命统治正在走向末路的时候，将整个华南和西南的权益出卖给美国，作为对其美国主子继续支持其垂死统治的献礼。魏德迈来华考察时，曾在华南作了周密的考察，并建议将华南作为蒋美统治基地。美国对华南政权形式表现了特别的关心，宋子文之出任蒋匪广东省主席，和接着被任为蒋匪广州行辕主任，即出自美国之计划。美国勾结蒋匪当局嗾使宋子文等所进行的华南“和平运动”阴谋，其目的亦在妄图保持华南美蒋封建殖民地统治。最近美人在两广、湖南等地之投资和考察粤汉、湘桂黔、浙赣、成渝、川康滇等铁路之由美人督令修建，华南美海空基地网之扩展，皆表现美国对华南及西南侵略之加紧。与美国华南侵略活动相联系着的，是美国在台湾势力之加强，蒋介石已同意美国完全占有台湾，并将之包括入美国在日本的占领体系中。
    但不管美帝国主义还给蒋介石什么援助，或采取另外的什么挣扎步骤，美蒋在中国的统治的死亡命运是已经不能挽回了。美国曾经给了蒋介石四十多万万美元的援助，试图消灭中国人民的民主独立运动，但其结果，是蒋介石的军事失败和中国全国反帝反封建革命新高潮的出现，是把蒋介石搬到了坟墓的边缘。美帝国主义虽然现在似乎已经领会到：美国指挥和美国装备的蒋介石军队“无非是美国武器的转运人员”（华盛顿邮报），领会到美国援助蒋介石的结局只会比援助希腊反动派的结局更坏些（纽约先驱论坛报），领会到“不论是美国金钱还是美国武器都不会使蒋介石的反共战争有多大支撑力了”（美联社），但美帝国主义者却毫无别的办法，只能继续沿着援助蒋介石的这条老路，把蒋介石和美国的在华统治拖进坟墓里去。至于中国人民斗争的伟大目标，则是彻底解放全中国，彻底消灭蒋介石的卖国统治，把帝国主义的势力完全扫除出中国，而且这个无限光明的日子已经为期不远了。
