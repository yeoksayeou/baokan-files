Taihang Second Military Sub-district New Recruit Training
	Great Results from Using Poor and Hired Peasants as Backbone

[Taihang News] Summary report on the political education of new recruits in the Second Regiment of the Taihang Second Military Sub-district: During the regiment's one-and-a-half-month training period, the entire regiment spent half a month conducting the "Three Checks" (checking class origin, checking work attitude, and checking combat will). Another five days were spent studying the People's Liberation Army Declaration. Political training focused on in-depth land reform and class education, with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, resulting in significant effectiveness. Firstly, upon gathering the new recruits, a comprehensive education was conducted for all soldiers regarding current affairs, enabling everyone to understand the scale of our victory today and establish faith in a bright future. At the general assembly of the entire regiment, some poor and hired soldiers made accusations, narrating their own histories of blood, sweat, and tears, and exposing the exploiting crimes of the landlord class, so that everyone was aware from the beginning that they were taking up arms to completely turn themselves over and defend their liberation; at the same time, everyone clarified the nature of the People's Liberation Army today, and established the concept of liberating the laboring brothers. From this, a movement to examine the motives for joining the army was launched, and everyone conducted reviews, returning those who were unqualified. After everyone had initially corrected their attitude towards the Liberation Army, they universally started with poor and hired peasants leading the way in speaking out about their suffering, from discussing suffering within the squad (group) to organizing the entire company to speak out about suffering. For example, after several typical accusations of suffering by the Twelfth Company, everyone's class emotions were stirred. When Ge Suxi recounted how his family was exploited by landlords, starved to death, five members in a row, with no land to bury them, and how he threw his sister in the wilderness, letting wolves bite her, the whole audience shed tears. Finally, he said with grief and indignation: "I am the only one left. I escaped and lived through blizzards barefoot. Now I want to avenge my brothers and sisters!" After this meeting, the soldiers who wanted to go home also turned to complaining about their suffering, and the comrades who superficially complained about suffering also turned to deep thinking and detailed discussions, and the learning situation was opened up from then on. The activists who emerged during the movement quickly formed poor and hired peasant groups to lead everyone in learning, and enabled the middle peasants to achieve solid unity. In this way, the movement quickly pushed towards a climax on a clear class line, and then ideological alignment was carried out. Those with good understanding and high consciousness were selected by everyone, and the previous squad and platoon cadres designated from above were replaced with new, active poor and hired peasants after democratic evaluation. In the final stage, during the People's Liberation Army education, everyone clarified from the contrast between the poor and rich in the old society who created the land and how the landlords took away their land. Everyone quickly recognized from defending the land that the essence of today's war is: "Chiang Kai-shek is fighting the civil war to protect the landlords and take away our land; we are fighting Chiang Kai-shek to defend our land and return home." Therefore, Zhang Laiyu of the Eleventh Company of the Third Battalion said during the study: "If you want to turn over completely, you must practice good skills to dig up Chiang's roots. If you want to dig up Chiang's roots, you must attack Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive." The awareness of the entire regiment of armed struggle and people's war has also been greatly improved. The entire regiment is now moving towards further training.

　　太行二分区新兵整训
  　贫雇作骨干收效大
    【太行消息】太行二分区补充第二团新兵政治教育总结报告：该团在一个半月的整训期中，全团用了半个月时间进行三查，另以五天学习人民解放军宣言，政治训练是以深入土改的阶级教育为基本内容，以贫雇战士为骨干，因而收效很大。首先在新兵集中后，便以当前时事向所有战士进行全面的教育，使大家了解今天我们胜利的规模，确立光明前途的信念。在全团成立大会上，有的贫雇战士进行了控诉，叙述自己流血、流汗、流泪的历史，揭露地主阶级的剥削罪恶，使大家在思想上，一开始就意识到自己是为了彻底翻身和保卫翻身而来掌握武装的；同时也使大家明确今天人民解放军的性质，树立解放劳苦兄弟的观念。从这当中，便展开了检查入伍动机运动，大家进行审查，将不合格的退回。在大家初步端正了对解放军的态度后，就普遍的以贫雇带头进行诉苦，由班内（小组）谈苦到组织全连诉苦，如十二连经过几个典型诉苦，便调动了大家的阶级情绪。当葛苏喜诉到他家被地主剥削一连饿死五口人，家没了地土、无处可埋，将自己姐姐扔在野地，让狼咬了时，全场都落了泪。最后他悲愤的说：“剩下我一个人，冒着雪赤着脚逃难过活，活到现在，我要为我的兄弟姐姐来报仇”！经过这个大会，有想家的战士也转向了诉苦，浮皮诉苦的同志也走向了深思细谈，学习局面从此打开。在运动中涌出的积极分子便很快组成了贫雇小组，领导大家进行学习，并使中贫农达到了巩固的团结。这样便使运动在明确的阶级路线上很快的推向了高潮，随即就进行了思想站队，认识好、觉悟高的被大家选了出来，把以前由上而下指定的班排干部，经过民主评定，换上了新的积极贫雇。最后一段，在进行解放军教育中，大家从旧社会的穷富对比中，明确了谁创造土地，地主如何夺去自己土地后，大家很快便从保卫土地上又进一步认识了今天战争的本质：“蒋介石打内战是为了保护地主夺去我们的土地，我们打蒋介石是为了保卫自己的土地还家。”因而，三营十一连的张来玉在学习中就说：“要想大翻身必须练好本领刨蒋根，要想刨蒋根，就要打到南京城，活捉蒋介石。”全团战士对武装对人民战争的自觉性也大为提高。现全团已走向进一步的整训。
