　　[Reported by our newspaper from Shahe] In Zhengzhao Village, during an in-depth investigation into the production difficulties of hired and poor peasants, it was discovered that because the hired and poor peasants did not have power to manage affairs, the fruits of labor allocated by the Farmers' Association were not distributed to the masses. At the 54 meetings of male and female hired and poor peasants, those who were reluctant to speak out began to take action after several days of investigation, mobilization, and assistance in solving their difficulties. In the review, Zhang Ju said: "The grain I harvested last year was not enough to eat. This year, even after wearing the 'turnover hat,' I still can't make ends meet. I couldn't afford to water the seedlings, so I had to go out and work for a few days before I could water them. After putting away the hoe, I worked as a carpenter for a few more days to buy some wheat seeds. But then I worried about plowing and harrowing the land because I didn't have any livestock. Later, I tightened my belt and sold some cloth and a bag of grain to buy some. Now that I have livestock, I don't even have fodder." Qi Zheng said: "We three families share a broken donkey. When planting, everyone wants to plant first. Later, we sold the donkey and bought a smaller one, still owing more than ten thousand yuan. The waterwheels and carts distributed to each team by the Farmers' Association have been left unused for a year because the middle peasants already have them. People with livestock use the carts for transportation, but only two of the seven carts in our third team are still usable. For households with waterwheels, either the buckets are missing, or they have all been replaced." Zhang Bing of the sixth team said: "Our team didn't get any waterwheels. The middle peasants, who have livestock, just pull them over and use them, and some even put their own waterwheels aside and use the ones from the team." Hou Bai of the second team said: "Our team leader (three middle peasants, one bankrupt landlord, and two poor peasants) let the middle peasants occupy the waterwheels. Their land is all in large plots of more than ten mu each. Once they're set up, they don't move. Our allocated land is one mu here and two mu there. When we want to use the waterwheel, they say: Can't you just use a well winch to water your little bit of land? We shouldn't use waterwheels because we have so little land." Ma Chenyou of the fifth team said: "Also, the Farmers' Association distributed two looms to each team, with thread on them, but they haven't been distributed yet. The parts on the machines are all gone, and no one can use them." Hou Fulai said: "Speaking of the distribution of fruits, I have a lot of complaints. In the past, my children and I worked as long-term laborers outside, and the women begged for food at home. Since the arrival of the Eighth Route Army, we've barely managed to survive. Later, during the struggle and distribution of fruits, our family didn't get anything, and we didn't dare to ask for it. The village cadres gave me a few mu of poor land that no one else wanted. When I wanted to exchange it for better land, I went to the director of the Farmers' Association, and he said: You still complain about the poor land? How much money did you contribute? From then on, I never said another word. I see that the middle peasants are much better off than us, and the land they got is better. Shi Zhenguo, the director, feeds two mules, wears woolen clothes and cotton-padded coats, and even wears a leather coat on top; he smokes cigarettes every day, which is enough for my family to eat millet." Li Xi said: "Speaking of this, I'm even more miserable. My family has nothing. A few days ago, my wife was in confinement, and there was no fire in the house, and no oil for the lamp. My wife sat on the cold kang, unable to move. I held her, and finally my mother brought a lamp of oil and helped me take care of the child. After the child was born, I bought two jin of white flour, but my wife couldn't bear to eat it. In the autumn, I bought a donkey, but by autumn there was no grass. I couldn't borrow any, and I didn't have money to buy any. I decided to sell the donkey. The team called me to a meeting and asked if I had any difficulties. I explained the situation, and the cadres asked me to haul coal to barely survive." Then everyone reviewed the past distribution of fruits and the work style of the cadres. Many middle peasant households received more fruits than the hired and poor peasants. Li Xi also said: "Look at those councilors, they are all middle peasants. How can the distribution be fair?" Qi Zheng said: "See who is running the village?" Some said it was the councilors, some said it was the village chief and director, and some said it was the leaders of the large and small teams. Bai said: "There are six or seven leaders of large and small teams in our street, but only two of them are poor peasants. How can they be close to us?" Then everyone started to investigate to see who actually controlled the village. Among the 46 cadres and leaders of large and small teams in the village, only 18 were poor and hired peasants, 26 were middle peasants, and 2 were bankrupt landlords. Among the poor and hired peasants, there were also a few who were ineffective. The power was all in the hands of the middle peasant cadres. From then on, everyone clearly realized that they suffered a great loss because they had no power.

　　正招村贫雇反对分果实不公
    大车水车分给互助组
  　贫雇没权想用不能用
    【本报沙河讯】正招村在深入检查雇贫农民的生产困难中，发现了因为雇贫没当权管事，农会分配果实没分到群众手中。在五十四个男女雇贫会上，不好吭气的人，经过几天来的检查发动和帮助解决困难，一部分雇贫开始行动起来。在检讨中张具的说：“去年我打的粮食就不够吃，今年戴上‘翻身帽’还是吃不下来，浇不起小苗，还出去做了几天活才浇了苗。挂锄钩后又去干了几天木匠活，才买了些麦种，可是犁耩地又发愁，没牲口使，后来就紧紧裤腰带卖了些布和一布袋粮食才买下，有了牲口，当下连草料都没有”。齐正的说：“俺们三家伙着一个破驴，种地时谁也想先种，后来把驴卖了，换个小驴，还欠一万多元钱。农会里分到各组的水车大车，因为中农们有的使，放了一年不给分，人家有牲口拉上大车搞运输，俺第三组七辆大车到如今只有两辆能用了。有水车的户不是把斗子没了，就是都换了。”第六大组张兵的说：“俺组的水车没分，中农有牲口拉上就去使换了，有些把自己的水车放下用组内的水车。”第二大组侯白的说：“俺组的组长（三个中农一个破落地主两个贫农）把水车让中农们占住了，人家的地一片都是十几亩，安上就不动了，咱分的地这里一亩，那里二亩，咱想使吧，人家说：你那一点地不会安上辘辘浇吗？咱这地少就不该使水车”。第五组马臣有说：“还有农会分到每组两个织布机，上边还带着线子，至今没分，把机上的零件都没有了，谁也不能用”。侯福来说：“说起分果实来我很有意见，过去我和俺孩在外边当长工，妇女在家要饭吃，自从八路军过来，算糊住吃了。后来搞斗争分果实咱家里啥也没有，也不敢说要，村干部把别人都不要的赖地分给了我几亩，我想换点好地，就去找农会主任，他说：你还嫌地赖哩？你出了几个钱？从那时我再也不吭一声了。眼看着中农们比咱时光强的多，比咱得的地还好，石振国当了主任，喂着两条骡子，穿着毛衣棉袄，外边还披着大皮袄；每天吸纸烟，就够俺一家吃小米。”李锡说：“说起这事我更苦了，我家里啥都没有，前几天老婆坐月子，家里连火都没生，灯也没油，老婆坐在凉炕沿上，生下小孩就板在凉炕上，老婆凉的也不能动了，我就扶住她，好容易满的娘才给拿来一灯油，帮助我收拾起孩子来。生下小孩来秤了二斤白面，老婆都舍不得吃。秋天买下一头驴，到秋后没有草了，借借不下，买吧没钱，我打定主意要卖驴，组里叫我开会，问我有啥困难，我说了说，干部就叫我拉起煤来，才算糊住嘴。”接着大家把过去分配果实、干部作风等都作了检查，好多中农户比雇贫分的果实还多。李锡又说：“咱看看那些评议员都是些中农，怎样能分配公平了？”齐正的说：“看看村里的事是谁当着家呢？”有的说是评议员，有的说是村长、主任，有的说是大小组长。白的说：“俺街大小组长六、七个，只有两个是贫农，你算算怎能和咱们近呢？”随即大家展开检查，看看村里的大权到底掌握在谁手？全村四十六个干部和大小组长，其中贫雇农只有十八个，中农二十六个，破落地主两个，贫雇中还有几个不顶事，大权都掌握在中农干部手中。从此大家都明确认识到自己没权才吃了大亏。（荣的、太山、奎林）
