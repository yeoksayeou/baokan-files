Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Henan, Shaanxi and Hubei, 29th—Most of the soldiers of the Reorganized 3rd Division who were captured in Xiping have joined the People's Liberation Army. They have been denouncing the crimes of the Chiang bandits at meetings to recount their suffering. In one unit, over 300 liberated fighters from the Reorganized 3rd Division, more than half of them poured out their grievances and expressed their determination to take revenge in the campaign to recount sufferings and seek revenge. A man named Liu Deshan from Shaanxi province recounted that his family used to be able to make a living, but later most of their property was taken away by the Ba長 [head of a sub-district]. Once, the house of a security captain named Gong was robbed, and Liu Deshan's family was falsely accused of the robbery. The whole family was arrested, and later they borrowed money from all sides to redeem the whole family. His father soon died from illness and anger. His older brother was conscripted into the army, and he and his mother fled to Ankang. As soon as they arrived, he was drafted by the Ba長. After he escaped, he was chased by the Ba長 until he had nowhere to go, so he jumped into the river and was carried several miles by the water before he was rescued. Later, he secretly returned, but was mistakenly labeled a bandit by the Ba長 Wu Yingzhang, who hung him up and beat him all night before selling him as a conscript. His mother was so angry that she went blind. He was押 [escorted] to the 94th Division, his body covered with sores, and he was as thin as a dead man, but he still had to dig fortifications, digging until the skin on his hands broke and bled, and he was even beaten by the company commander with a wooden stick. The Chiang bandits often stripped seriously ill people naked, tied three or five of them together, and buried them alive. He and other sick people were also carried to the field. Many sick people screamed, "Don't bury me! I can still live!" But they were still pushed into the pit one by one. Later, because the Chiang bandits had not finished burying them, the troops assembled, and Liu Deshan was left with his life. Speaking of this, he seemed even more resentful. He said, "As long as I live, I will never forget this blood feud!"

　　整三师被俘士兵
  　参加我军报蒋仇
    【新华社豫陕鄂前线廿九日电】在西平获得解放的整三师士兵大部参加了解放军，他们纷纷在诉苦会上控诉蒋匪罪恶。某部三百余整三师解放战士，在诉苦复仇运动中，一半以上的人尽情的倒出了苦水，表示了复仇的决心。一个叫刘德山的陕西人控诉说，他家里原来还可以过活，后来家产大部被保长要走了。有一次一个姓弓的保安队长家被抢了，硬诬是刘德山家抢的。把一家人都捉了去，后来东借西卖凑钱把全家赎出来，父亲连病带气很快就死了。哥哥被抓去当兵，他和母亲逃到安康，刚到就被保长派了壮丁。他逃跑后，被保长追得走头无路，便跳了河被河水冲了几里路才被救起。以后他偷偷回去，但又被保长吴营章误批为匪，吊打一夜后，卖了壮丁，他娘因此气得瞎了眼。他被押到九十四师，浑身长了疮，瘦得象死人，可是还得挖工事，挖得两手皮破，鲜血淋漓，还被连长用木棍打。蒋匪对重病号常是剥光衣服，三五个捆在一起活埋。他也和其他病号被抬到野外，许多病号都惨叫着：“不要埋我呀！我还能活呀！”但仍被一个个推进坑里。后来因为蒋匪还没有埋完，队伍就集合了，刘德山留得了一条活命。他说到这里，更加显得愤恨，他说：“我活着一天，就永忘不了这血海深仇”！
