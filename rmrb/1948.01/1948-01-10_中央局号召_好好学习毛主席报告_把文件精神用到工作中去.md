  　Diligently Study Chairman Mao's Report
    Apply the Spirit of the Document to Work
    [Report from this newspaper] In addition to the Central Bureau's Propaganda Department previously informing Party, government, military, and civilian cadres in various regions to diligently organize the study of Chairman Mao's important document, "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," the Central Bureau also convened a meeting of leading comrades at the department level and above on the 6th of this month. The meeting was specifically for studying Chairman Mao's report word by word, paragraph by paragraph, engaging in repeated discussions, and raising many questions. The meeting pointed out that Chairman Mao's report is the central focus of cadre study at present. It called on every cadre to carefully study the report in connection with their own work and to implement the spirit of the document in all their work. To this end, responsible comrades are required to collect opinions and questions about Chairman Mao's report from directly affiliated organs. The Central Bureau plans to continue to hold meetings to discuss and study these, in conjunction with the specific thinking of the cadres, and to make a general report at a larger meeting.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 6th: The CPC Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau recently instructed all localities and departments to immediately organize the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's report "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," and to widely promote it among the masses through various means. The instruction stated: Comrade Mao Zedong's report will further unite and strengthen the power of the Chinese people, ultimately defeat Chiang Kai-shek, defeat the enslavement plan of American imperialism, and push the Chinese revolution towards national victory. At the same time, this document has great guiding and inspiring effects not only for the Chinese people but also for the entire Eastern nations and the people of the world. The instruction requires the heads of all organs to lead by example, diligently study the report, and be responsible for organizing Party members and non-Party members in their units to study and discuss it together, making it the main content of cadre study during this period. The class investigation and thought reform movement should be carried out around this study, using this document as a weapon to transform thought and enhance political understanding. Comrades participating in land reform in various localities should take time out from their work to study and discuss, so that they can grasp the spirit of this report when implementing policies. At the same time, they should promote this report to the peasants in conjunction with the Land Law, so that they understand how to combine their own vital interests with the fundamental interests of the Chinese revolution. The troops should take this report as the central material for military and political education, and repeatedly educate cadres and soldiers, in order to improve their political and ideological, and strategic and tactical thinking. All secondary schools and above should take this report as the central material for political education.
