Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 31st – Xi'an dispatch: Since the People's Liberation Army under Generals Chen Geng and Kong Congzhou entered the Henan-Hubei border region and expanded their offensive, the bandit gangs of Hu Zongnan and Zhu Shaozhou have been as anxious as ants on a hot pot. In addition to forcing citizens to store three months' worth of grain and levying over one million yuan in Chiang currency to reinforce city defenses, they have also carried out large-scale bloody massacres of innocent people and former subordinates of Zhao Shoushan and Kong Congzhou. Ma Qingwan, long despised by the people of Shaanxi, has been re-employed in an attempt to win over Northwest Army officers. The Hu bandits and others are also attempting to establish "Self-Defense Regiments" in various counties, one regiment for first-class counties, one battalion for second-class counties, and one company for third-class counties. In early September, Pan Yuan, the Chiang bandit county magistrate of Weinan County, falsely reported to Zhu Shaozhou that the "Self-Defense Regiment" had been established on schedule. Unexpectedly, two or three hours later, eight or nine vehicles arrived from Xi'an to transport the "Self-Defense Regiment" to the front lines. The county magistrate was in a cold sweat and had to send the "Self-Defense Regiment," hired to defend the city for 300,000 gold yuan a month. Despite the Hu bandits' strict blockade of news, the news of the annihilation of the Hu bandit's main force, the 76th Division, in Qingjian in October, and the capture of Liao Ang, still reached the ears of the common people, greatly encouraging the people of Xi'an. A farmer surnamed Xing in Lintong said, "The Kuomintang has plundered my two main rooms, one courtyard of foundations, eighteen mu of land, one cow, and one big girl. After selling all the grain, I sold the trees, and now I have to sell the farm tools. We hope the Eighth Route Army will come quickly!"

　　豫陕鄂我攻势强大
    西安蒋匪慌忙设防
    临潼农民盼望我军
    【新华社西北三十一日电】西安讯：陈赓、孔从周将军所部解放军进入豫、鄂边区扩展攻势后，胡宗南、祝绍周匪帮急得象热锅上的蚂蚁，除迫令市民储粮三月，摊派蒋币百余万万元用以加厚城防工事外，并大举血腥屠杀无辜人民与赵寿山、孔从周旧部。早为陕西人民所鄙弃的马青宛，已被起用，借以笼络西北军军官。胡匪等并企图在各县成立“自卫团”，甲等县一个团，乙等县一个营，丙等县一个连。九月初蒋匪渭南县县长潘元向祝绍周谎报“自卫团”已如期成立。不料过了两三个钟头，西安就派来八、九辆汽车，要装“自卫团”开赴前线。该县长急得满头大汗，只得把用三十万金一月雇来守城的“自卫团”送去。尽管胡匪严密封锁消息，十月间胡匪主力七十六师在清涧被歼、廖昂被俘的新闻，仍传到了老百姓的耳朵，大大鼓舞了西安人民。临潼一个邢姓农民说：“刮（国）民党把我两间上房一院庄基、十八亩地、一头牛、一个大姑娘全盘刮光了，卖完了粮卖树，现在只得卖农具了，八路军快些来嘛！”
