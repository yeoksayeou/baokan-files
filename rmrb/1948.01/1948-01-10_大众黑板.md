　　Our Northeast Army won another great victory the day before yesterday (the 7th), wiping out two entire divisions of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, none of whom escaped. A truly magnificent victory!
　　In southern Shanxi: Our army captured Yuncheng, scaring the Yan Xishan troops occupying Anyi, who abandoned Anyi and fled to Xinjiang County. There, our troops and militia blocked and annihilated over 1,300 of them.
　　The militia district cadre team of our Fourth Sub-district of Taihang launched an offensive against the enemy in Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, Wushe, and Huojia, eliminating over 400 enemies in seven days.
　　In western Shandong Province: In the two battles of Kaocheng and Dongming, we eliminated over 10,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in three days. In the Huxi area of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, relying on tunnels, we fought Chiang Kai-shek's army, eliminating over 500 of them in ten days, while we only suffered six casualties. This rendered the enemy's howitzers and tanks helpless, protecting our land and grain distribution.

    关东咱们军队在大前天（七号）又打一个大胜仗，消灭蒋介石两个整师，一个也没跑了。真是打得好！
    在山西南边：咱们军队打下运城，吓得占安邑城的阎锡山部队，扔下安邑就跑了，跑到新绛县，又叫咱们部队和民兵堵住、消灭了他一千三百多人。
    咱太行四分区的民兵区干队，向焦作、修武、武涉、获嘉几个地方的敌人进攻，七天里就消灭敌人四百多。
    在山东省西边：咱们打考城和东明两仗中，三天消灭蒋介石一万多人。在冀鲁豫湖西区，咱们凭着地道打蒋介石军队，十天消灭他五百多人，我只死伤六个人，弄得敌人的榴弹炮和坦克也莫奈何，保护了自己分田分粮。
