Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Paris dispatch: "Bidault has sold France to Truman," this is what *L'Humanité* said of Bidault's signing of the "Franco-American Bilateral Agreement" with American Ambassador to France, Caffery, on the 2nd. The agreement stipulates that France will receive $69 million from the $522.2 million "US Interim Aid Law for France, Italy, and Austria," and France agrees to: (1) The "aid" items can be distributed not only by the government but also by private groups under American supervision; (2) Except for oil and petroleum products, goods should be purchased in the United States; (3) France should deposit an amount of francs equivalent to the dollar price of the goods delivered to France, and the unused balance at the end of June will be used for France. This traitorous agreement has caused widespread unease in French public opinion. According to *L'Humanité's* analysis on the 3rd, this agreement "is actually proof of France's economic surrender to the United States." The method of distributing goods not only facilitates French monopoly groups in seeking private gain, but the clause to deposit francs and use them in France will greatly increase American investment in France. After the rumored devaluation of the franc becomes a reality, this investment will allow the United States to buy French factories with less expense and enslave the French economy more deeply. Moreover, *L'Humanité* stated on the 6th that the agreement also "opens the borders for the activities of the American fifth column, and American controllers and supervisors will be able to demand all the information they want."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Paris dispatch: On the same day that the French reactionaries signed the "Franco-American Bilateral Agreement" selling out their country to the United States, they re-submitted the Mayer tax plan, which had been amended and passed by the parliament at the end of last year, to the parliament, and it was passed without reservation by the parliament's reactionary coalition vote on the 5th and 6th. The Schuman reactionary authorities believed that the previously passed tax law was not "strict" enough, so in the revised plan, the tax burden of 125 billion francs was completely imposed on workers, peasants, small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businesses, and freelancers. This plan, a "cruel attack on the common people" (*L'Humanité*), immediately aroused dissatisfaction among a wide range of French people. A new protest movement is brewing. The General Confederation of Labor convened a national committee in Paris on the day the Mayer bill was passed in the National Assembly (the 5th) to discuss the situation; and on the 7th, it issued a "Letter to the Working People," calling on them to rise up and demand wage increases to cope with the increase in living expenses. The National Committee opposes the Marshall Plan and criticizes the "Workers' Force" traitors, declaring that these traitors are largely responsible for the workers' unmet demands. The National Committee calls on the working people to strengthen unity because "the division of the working class clears the way for poverty and dictatorship." At the same time, the National Committee issued a "Letter to the Youth," which pointed out the strength of French young workers in recent strikes and called on them to continue the struggle to improve living standards. The letter called on French youth to launch a nationwide movement to strive for the convening of a French Labor Youth Congress this spring.

Many shops in the Paris area announced a market strike on the 6th to protest the new tax law. On the 7th, Parisian merchants held a mass protest meeting, and the participants unanimously decided not to elect those members of parliament who defended the bill in parliament, and not to trust or assist the government until the government reduces budget expenditures and implements administrative reforms. *L'Humanité*, in denouncing the bill, said: "As a result of the passage of the Mayer bill, tens of thousands of small and medium-sized factories face bankruptcy, and a large number of employees will lose their jobs. They obey American orders and increase taxes in France, which has become part of the notorious dollar 'aid'."

　　比道尔出卖法国给杜鲁门
  　签订“法美双边协定”
    巴黎罢市抗议新税收法
    【新华社陕北十一日电】巴黎讯：“比道尔把法国卖给杜鲁门了”，这是人道报对比道尔与美驻法大使卡佛利于二日签订“法美双边协定”的评语。该协定规定法国自“美对法、意、奥临时援助法”五亿二千二百万元项下，获得六千九百万美元的“援助”，而法国同意：（一）“援助”之物品，在美国监督下，不仅可由政府而且也可由私人团体分配；（二）除石油与石油产品外，货物应在美国购买；（三）法国应存放一笔法郎，其价值应与交予法国之货物的美元价格相当，到六月底结存的未动用余款将用于法国。这一卖国协定引起了法国舆论广泛的不安。据人道报三日之分析，这一协定“实际上是法国经济投降美国的证据”。货物的分配法，不仅便利法国垄断集团营私舞弊，而存放一笔法郎并使用于法国的条款，将使美国对法的投资大形增加，在传闻中的法郎贬值成为事实后，这笔投资将使美国以更少的花费购买法国工厂，而更深入地奴役法国经济。不仅如此，六日人道报称该协定并“为美国第五纵队的活动打开疆界，美国管制人与监督人将能要求一切他所想要的情报”。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】巴黎讯：法国反动当局于签订拍卖祖国于美国的“法美双边协定”同一天，又将去年年底已由议会修正通过的迈耶税收计划加以重订，再次提交议会，并于五、六两日由议会的反动联合票无保留地通过。舒曼反动当局认为前此通过之税收法不“严厉”，因此在重订之计划中，将一千二百五十亿法郎的税收负担，完全强加于工人、农民、中小工商业及自由职业者身上。这一“对小百姓残酷”（人道报）进攻的计划，立即引起法国广泛阶层的不满。新的抗议运动正在酝酿中。总工会于迈耶法案在国民议会通过之日（五日），即于巴黎召开全国委员会，讨论形势；并于七日发表“告劳动人民书”，号召他们起来要求增资以应付生活费的增涨。全委会反对马歇尔计划，并抨击“工人力量”叛徒，宣称工人要求之未获得满足，这些叛徒应负大部分责任。全委会号召劳动人民加强团结，因为“工人阶级的分裂是为贫穷和独裁统治扫清道路”。同时全委会发表“告青年书”，该书指出法国青年工人在最近罢工中的坚强性，并号召他们继续斗争，争取提高生活标准。该书号召法国青年发动全国性运动，争取今春召开法国劳动青年代表大会。
    巴黎区很多商店则于六日宣布罢市，抗议新税收法。七日巴黎商人并举行群众抗议大会，参加会议者一致决定：不选举那些在议会中维护该法案的议员，并且在政府减低预算支出和实施行政改革以前，不信任政府，不援助政府。人道报在痛斥此一法案时说：“由于迈耶法案通过的结果，成万的中小工厂面临破产，并将有大批职工失业。他们服从美国命令，在法国加税，这成为臭名远扬的美元‘援助’的一部分。”
