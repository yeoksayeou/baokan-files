Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd: The General Political Department of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, in order to adapt to the current combat tasks and the rapid promotion of lower-level cadres whose abilities urgently need improvement, has issued instructions on changing the leadership style and methods of political work. It states briefly: In the past, leadership organs adopted working methods such as issuing instructions, issuing plans, convening meetings from top to bottom to arrange work, and general inspections and general summaries, which can no longer adapt to the current situation. It is necessary to immediately implement the leadership policy of "unified planning, decentralized leadership": that is, after collective consultation, responsible cadres from the column to the regiment level should take turns going down to the lower levels regularly for on-the-spot guidance, on-the-spot supervision and inspection, on-the-spot summary of experience, and on-the-spot education of cadres. Leadership organs at all levels must take most of their work down to the lower levels, and link the understanding of the situation, the implementation of leadership, the completion of tasks, and the study of experience to avoid the phenomenon of separation between upper and lower levels. It is necessary to check work in a timely manner, discover problems in a timely manner, correct deviations, and exchange experiences, without waiting for a battle or a task to be completely completed before proceeding. To realize this leadership method, it is necessary to mobilize all cadres to carry forward the spirit of hard work, not to make a fuss about status, and to conscientiously and responsibly do their work well.

　　适应部队目前作战需要东北政工采用新领导法
    【新华社东北二十三日电】东北解放军总政治部为适应目前战斗任务的需要及下级干部提拔快，能力亟需提高等具体情况，特发出关于改变政治工作领导作风与领导方法的指示。略称：过去领导机关采用发指示，发计划，由上而下召集会议，布置工作，和一般检查，一般总结等工作方法，已不能适应目前情况。必须立即实行“统一计划，分散领导”的领导方针：即在集体会商之后，从纵队到团的各级负责干部轮流定期到下面去就地指导，就地督促、检查，就地总结经验和就地教育干部。各级领导机关要把大部分工作都拿到下面去做，要把了解情况、实施领导、完成任务和研究经验四者互相联系起来，以避免上下隔膜的现象。要适时检查工作，及时发现问题，纠正偏向和交流经验，不要等待一个战役和一件工作完全结束之后才去进行，要实现这种领导方法，就要动员所有干部发扬艰苦精神，不闹地位，认真负责把工作做好。
