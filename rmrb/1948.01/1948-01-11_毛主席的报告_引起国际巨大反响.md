　　Chairman Mao's Report
　　Arouses Great International Repercussions
    [Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch] According to foreign news agencies: Chairman Mao's historic document, "The Current Situation and Our Tasks," has aroused great repercussions internationally. Moscow newspapers published the full text of Chairman Mao's report, and Moscow Radio also broadcast the full text, along with news recordings. The reactionary American bourgeoisie, on the other hand, was panic-stricken by the worldwide impact of this article. The Howard newspaper chain exclaimed that the broadcast of Mao Zedong's article was "more significant" than the establishment of the Greek democratic government and the deepening division within the American bourgeoisie (Wallace's participation in the US presidential election).

　　毛主席的报告
  　引起国际巨大反响
    【新华社九日电】据外国通讯社消息：毛主席“目前形势和我们的任务”此一历史性文件，在国际上引起巨大反响。莫斯科各报纸刊载毛主席报告全文，莫斯科电台亦予全文广播，并发记录新闻。反动的美国资产阶级则对此文世界影响惊惶万状。霍华德系报纸惊呼毛泽东文章的广播较之希腊民主政府的成立。美国资产阶级内部分裂加深（华莱士参加美总统竞选）两事“意义更为重大”。
