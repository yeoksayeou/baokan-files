Taihang News: The Zuoquan United Stone Printing Factory has successfully experimented with using calendered paper to replace chemographic paper. There are three differences in the usage method compared to chemographic paper: (1) When writing, the lithographic ink should be slightly thicker than when writing on chemographic paper. (2) When putting it on the printing stone, use more water than with chemographic paper. Because calendered paper has no viscosity, but also absorbs ink, it is not afraid of blurred writing even with more water. (3) The pressing time, the first time should be more than ten minutes, and then when pressing again, about a quarter of an hour, the writing can be pressed on. When applying water the second time, be careful not to lift the base paper when removing the lead sheet, the water should be applied to the paper pasted on the printing stone, to avoid the base paper moving and being damaged. This invention was researched by the factory many times. First, they tried coating a layer of peach gum on glossy paper, but it was not successful. Later, "kraft paper" was also unsuccessful. Using glossy calendered paper was the result of the final experiment. After the experiment was successful, the factory printed a thousand copies of share account books using glossy calendered paper for the first time, and the quality was the same as that printed with chemographic paper. Now, except for printing fine work that requires chemographic paper, they use glossy calendered paper for general rough work. This not only saves money, but also greatly overcomes the difficulty of obtaining chemographic paper.

　　用粉连纸代替药纸
  　左权石印厂试验成功
    【太行消息】左权联合石印厂，用油光粉连纸代替药纸的实验已经成功。使用办法与药纸有三点不同：（一）写字时候，药墨比往药纸上写要浓一些。（二）上版时候，用水要比药纸大一些，因为油光粉连纸无粘性，但本身也吃墨，水大也不怕字迹模糊。（三）压的时间，第一次要在十分钟以上，再压时，用一刻钟左右，字就可压上；二次上水，掀铅皮注意不要连底版带起，水要上到贴版纸上，避免底版纸移动拉坏。这个发明曾经过该厂多次研究，先是用油光纸涂上一层桃胶，没有成功。后又用“牛皮纸”亦未成功。用油光粉连纸是最后试验的结果。在试验成功后，该厂第一次用油光粉连纸印股金帐，一下就印了一千多份，质量和药纸印的一样。现在他们除印细活用药纸外，一般粗活都用油光粉连纸。不但节省了经济，并大大克服了药纸来源困难。
