　　Village Military Committee Director's Extravagant Wedding
  　District Discovers, Removes from Post, and Returns Extorted Gifts
    [Gaoyi News] Dong Xintai, the Director of the Gaoyi Licun Military Committee, held his wedding in the village on the 29th of last month. Before the wedding, he first mobilized support in the Farmers' Association, urging the basic masses to "take the lead," and then mobilized again at the People's School, "mobilizing" for 128,900 Jicha banknotes. In reality, the masses were very dissatisfied because it was a form of extortion, ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 per household, with only three households in Xilicun not paying. Even elementary school students contributed 10,500 yuan in silver dollars. During the wedding, children performed Yangko dances for half a day, carried on sedan chairs by the masses, without receiving any payment, and held a large banquet with over 200 people eating and more than 30 catties of liquor consumed. Such extravagance is truly rare. Upon discovering this, the district leadership, based on the above facts, not only removed the director of the Military Committee from his post but also returned the items extorted from the masses to their original owners.

　　里村武委会主任结婚大浪费
  　区上发觉撤职退回摊派礼物
    【高邑消息】高邑里村武委会主任董新太上月廿九号在本村结婚，结婚前先在农会动员拥护，叫基本群众“带头”，然后在民校又动员，“动员”冀钞十二万八千九百元。实际是群众很不满意，是摊派式的，每户一千至二千，西里村仅三户未出钱。小学生还出大洋一万五百元。在结婚时儿童扭秧歌半天，坐群众轿，分文不给，大排酒席，吃饭的有二百余人，喝酒三十多斤。这种浪费现象，实在少有。区领导上发觉，根据以上事实，除撤职武委会主任，并将群众东西原物退还。（福保、世杰）
