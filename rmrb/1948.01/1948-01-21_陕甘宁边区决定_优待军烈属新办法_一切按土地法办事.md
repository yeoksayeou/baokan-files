Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 18th: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, in order to correct the serious phenomenon in various localities of indiscriminately providing preferential treatment to military, martyr, and worker dependents regardless of their wealth, increasing the burden on peasants, and creating a situation where the lives of cadres' family members are special and detached from the masses; and regarding the handling of demobilized soldiers, has made the following decisions: (1) All poor military, martyr, and worker dependents and themselves should be allocated a share of land, livestock, farm tools, grain, and other property in accordance with the principle of equal distribution of land. The widowed, orphaned, and childless elderly should be taken care of with the consent of the masses, helping them to lay the foundation for establishing a household and achieving self-sufficiency in production. (2) All material preferential treatment for worker dependents should be stopped (extremely poor and weak worker dependents who cannot maintain their lives for the time being should be given appropriate relief). (3) Military and martyr dependents who are middle peasants or above will not be given any material preferential treatment. (4) Poor military and martyr dependents who have labor power will also not be given material preferential treatment after they have obtained land and means of production in the land reform. Those who lack labor power may be given assistance with labor or plowing, and subsidies for firewood, etc., but this must be reviewed and evaluated by the village poor peasant leagues or peasant congresses and reported to the county government for unified implementation. (5) Poor demobilized soldiers who have not settled down should be given consideration by the masses when distributing land and property in the land reform. Disabled and demobilized soldiers who have been resettled in rural areas over the years should be reviewed by the masses. Good ones should be commended, and those who oppress the masses should be educated by the masses, and even have their disability certificates or demobilization certificates confiscated, and all preferential treatment they should enjoy should be revoked. (6) Poor military and martyr dependents and disabled or demobilized soldiers who are actively engaged in production and have good relations with the masses should be given more encouragement and comfort in politics and spirit.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th: The Delegates' Conference of Honored Soldiers here opened on December 22nd of last year and closed on the 5th of this month. A total of 2,049 delegates and responsible personnel from provinces, military regions, and counties in charge of managing honored soldiers attended the meeting. The honored soldier delegates received a warm welcome and respect. Frontline troops sent telegrams of condolence one after another. Workers, shop assistants, students, and representatives of various agencies in Harbin jointly presented flags and慰问品 to them. Luo Ronghuan, Deputy Political Commissar of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, and Lin Feng and Gao Chongmin, Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Northeast Political Committee, respectively, attended and delivered speeches. Comrade Zhou Huan, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, conveyed the "Decision on Handling Honored Soldiers," and then group meetings were held, and everyone reflected deeply in connection with themselves and launched debates. Because the spirit of criticism and self-criticism was brought into play, the meeting achieved two important gains: First, it corrected the one-sided emphasis of many delegates on the shortcomings of the local work on honored soldiers, while neglecting the examination of their own thoughts, such as the interference in the peasant struggle, beating and scolding people, selling public property, and not being content with work that occurred among some honored soldiers. Everyone expressed that they would strictly abide by government decrees and military discipline, support the peasant struggle, actively participate in various tasks, those who can go to the front will return to the front, and those who cannot go to the front will actively participate in production and work in the rear, and strive to support the front. Second, comrades in charge of managing honored soldiers in various provinces, military regions, and counties also made strict self-criticisms, such as the bureaucratic and irresponsible attitude in handling the work of honored soldiers. After days of discussion, the honored soldier representatives of various provinces signed the "Honored Soldier Competition Treaty," and on the 5th, the "Decision of the Honored Soldier Delegates' Conference" was unanimously adopted. It was also decided that in the old lunar New Year, each province would convene a delegates' conference of honored soldiers to convey the decisions of this conference and conduct a comprehensive rectification of thought and discipline. Comrade Zhou Huan said at the closing ceremony: In the future, honored soldiers in the localities should be supervised by the poor and hired peasants, and the peasant associations can review the honored soldiers regularly. Finally, the conference unanimously passed a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, expressing that they would abide by the revolutionary discipline of honored soldiers, and determined to continue to exert their strength, take on various jobs, and do their best to support the front, so as to strive for the early arrival of victory.

    【新华社东北十八日电】此间荣誉军人代表大会在去年十二月廿二日开幕，到本月五日闭幕。到会代表及各省、军区和县负责管理荣军的工作人员共二千零四十九人。荣军代表们受到了热烈的欢迎和尊敬。前方部队纷纷来电慰问。哈市工人、店员、学生与各机关代表联合向他们献旗赠送慰劳品。东北解放军副政委罗荣桓，东北政委会正副主席林枫、高崇民等均出席致词。东北解放军政治部副主任周桓同志传达“关于处理荣誉军人决定”后，即分开小组会，大家联系自己深刻反省，展开争论。由于发挥了批评与自我批评的精神，使会议得到两个重要收获：一是纠正了许多代表片面强调地方上对荣军工作的缺点，而忽略了对自己思想的检查，如某些荣军中发生的干涉农民斗争，打人骂人，变卖公物，不安心工作等。大家都表示今后一定严守政府法令和军队纪律，支持农民斗争，积极参加各种工作，能上前方的重返前线，不能上前方的，则积极参加后方生产和工作，努力支援前线。二是各省、军区和县管理荣军工作的同志也作了严格的自我检讨，如对处理荣军工作存在着的官僚主义和不负责任的态度等。经过连日讨论，各省荣军代表们签订了“荣军竞赛条约”，五日全体一致通过“荣军代表大会决定”。并决定在旧历年关，各省召开荣军代表大会，传达此次大会的决定，普遍的整顿思想和纪律。周桓同志在闭幕大会上说：今后荣军在地方上要受贫雇农的监督，农会可以定期的审查荣军。最后大会一致通过致电毛主席、朱总司令，表示今后决遵守荣誉军人的革命纪律，决心继续发挥力量，走上各种工作岗位，尽力支援前线，以争取胜利的早日到来。
