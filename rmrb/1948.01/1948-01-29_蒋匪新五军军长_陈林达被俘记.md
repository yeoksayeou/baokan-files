Xinhua News Agency Northeast, 26th Dispatch: Reporter Chang Gong reports on the capture of Chen Linda, Commander of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's New 5th Army: Chen Linda was identified on the seventh day after being captured. He was the first Chiang Kai-shek army commander captured since the Northeast People's Liberation Army's major counter-offensive. When the People's Liberation Army shelled Wenjiatai, he was squatting in the 43rd Division headquarters bunker supervising the battle. Later, the People's Liberation Army's artillery fire became increasingly intense, and not only did the soldiers collapse and scatter, but even the division commander and regimental commander who were supervising the battle with him fled in all directions. He himself desperately led seven guards out of the bunker in an attempt to escape. But before he could run a hundred meters, he was captured by the People's Liberation Army.

After being captured, he pretended to be a secretary in the military headquarters and even changed his name. He wore an oil-stained coat, broken shoes, and smeared a layer of black ash on his face, hiding in a dark corner, not saying a word all day long. But his subordinate officers finally revealed his secret. At first, he didn't admit it, but when he saw the human and material evidence, he had to stammer, "There's no need for me to hide it anymore. I know your policies, and I know you won't kill me." Regarding the annihilation of the New 5th Army, he believes this was a heavy blow to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Northeast China. Because the New 5th Army was the "important mobile force" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Northeast China. Its subordinate 195th Division used to be the main force of the 52nd Army, and the 43rd Division was the main force of the 94th Army. Although in terms of equipment and training it was not as good as the New 1st Army and New 6th Army, in terms of marching ability and combat effectiveness, it surpassed them. He believes that the reason for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' failure in the Gongzhuling campaign, in addition to the mistakes in command by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' Northeast Headquarters and himself, was mainly because the People's Liberation Army's tactics were unpredictable, and especially the bravery and tenacity of the commanders and fighters were unmatched by them. He said, "I have been through hundreds of battles and have never seen such a capable army." Therefore, he believes that the future of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Northeast China is very pessimistic. Chen Linda is from Xiangtan, Hunan, is 45 years old this year, and graduated from the fourth class of the Whampoa Military Academy.

　　蒋匪新五军军长
  　陈林达被俘记
    【新华社东北二十六日电】分社记者常工报导蒋匪新五军军长陈林达被俘情形：陈林达是被俘后的第七天查出来的，他是东北解放军大反攻以来俘获的第一名蒋匪军长。当解放军炮击文家台时，他正蹲在四十三师师部掩蔽部督战。后来解放军炮火愈来愈猛，不仅士兵纷纷溃散，连和他一起督战的师长、团长也都四散逃生。他自己狼狈的带了七个卫士从掩蔽部跑出来，企图逃走。但没有跑出一百米达远，就被解放军俘获了。
    他被俘以后假装是军部的书记官，并且还换了个名字。身上穿着一件油污的大衣，脚上踏着一双破鞋，又在脸上涂上一层黑灰，整天躲在阴暗的屋角里不吭气。那知他的下级军官终于揭穿了他的秘密。开始他还不承认，后来看到人证物证，只好嗫嚅地说：“我用不着再隐瞒了，你们的政策我是知道的，你们不杀我也是知道的。”对于这次新五军的覆没，他认为这是给东北蒋匪一个沉重的打击。因为新五军是东北蒋匪的“重要机动部队”，其所辖一九五师过去是五十二军的主力，四十三师是九十四军的主力，虽然在装备和训练上不如新一军、新六军，但在行军力和战斗力上则超过它们。他认为蒋匪在公主屯战役的失败原因，除了蒋匪东北行辕和他的指挥错误外，主要还是解放军战术变化莫测，尤其是指战员的勇猛顽强是他们无法比拟的。他说：“我经过数百次战斗，没有看见过这样能打的部队”，因此他认为东北蒋匪的前途非常悲观。陈林达是湖南湘潭人，现年四十五岁，黄埔四期毕业。
