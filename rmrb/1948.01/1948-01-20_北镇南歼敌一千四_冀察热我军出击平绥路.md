Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 18th: On the morning of the 13th, one regiment of the Chiang bandit's 93rd Army and two regiments of the 184th Division of the 60th Army, entrenched at Goubangzi, the connecting point of the Beining Railway and the Yingkou branch line, launched a three-pronged attack on Xiaogujiazi, Jiuzhan, Ertaizi and other places south of Beizhen. The People's Liberation Army bravely countered, and after fierce fighting until 6:00 PM, all the enemy forces were defeated by us. The remnants fled in disorder back to Goubangzi and Qingduizi. In this battle, a total of 818 enemy officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, and 625 were captured alive. We seized nine 60mm mortars, 38 light and heavy machine guns, 52 submachine guns, and 361 rifles and carbines. Note: The county seat of Beizhen was once occupied by the People's Liberation Army at the beginning of the winter offensive. After annihilating a portion of the bandit security team in the county on the 5th of this month, it re-entered and stationed in the city.

On the evening of the 27th of last month, we captured the Zhongyangfang stronghold, located more than 20 li northeast of Yanqing, and destroyed a section of the Kangzhuang to Chadao railway, including eight iron bridge spans. On the 29th, another unit of the People's Liberation Army sabotaged a section of the Ping-Sui Railway between Shahe and Qinghe, and simultaneously attacked the Gaoshansi stronghold east of Yanqing, annihilating most of the defending police force, forcing the Chiang bandits along the line to live in constant anxiety.
