Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Moscow dispatch: Soviet newspapers have recently been criticizing the expansionist policies of U.S. imperialism. The *Pravda* published Zhukov's travelogue on the United States, stating: "The economic and diplomatic brokers of Wall Street are intensifying their aggression in order to monopolize the world market, squeeze out the already weakened Britain, infringe on Britain's 'spheres of influence,' colonies, and dominions, and treat Western Europe as an American semi-colony. But despite this, the 'boom' in exports still cannot solve America's economic problems." *Red Star* exposed how American warmongers are creating a set of "preemptive war theories" in reactionary magazines such as "American Aviation" and "National Geographic." They use the lie that the United States will be attacked by enemies "to threaten the American people," and then clamor that the enemy must be "extinguished" and "destroyed." *Labor* reminded readers to pay attention to the United States' activities in the Mediterranean, stating: "What the United States is doing in the Mediterranean is enough to prove the insatiable greed of U.S. imperialism. It is eager to extinguish the resistance of the Greek people, and is doing its utmost to increase support for the Turkish reactionary regime. It is sending more reinforcements to the Mediterranean in an attempt to carry out its new adventurous conspiracy." *Labor* also pointed out: "This frantic behavior of the American reactionaries reflects the anxiety of the Wall Street rulers about the growing resistance of the broad masses of people in the Mediterranean region."

　　害怕人民力量日益增涨美帝加紧侵略欧洲各国
    【新华社陕北廿五日电】莫斯科讯：苏联各报近纷纷抨斥美帝国主义的扩张政策。真理报发表朱可夫的游美通讯称：“华尔街的经济和外交掮客，正变本加厉的进行侵略，以期独占世界市场，排挤着已经衰弱的英国，侵犯英国的‘势力范围’、殖民地和自治领，把西欧当作美国输出的半殖民地。但尽管如此，出口‘景气’仍不能解决美国的经济问题”。红星报揭露美国的战争贩子在“美国航空”、“全国地理”等反动杂志上，制造一套“先发制人的战争理论”。他们以美国将遭敌人进攻的谎言“来威胁美国老百姓”，“然后就叫嚣必须‘扑灭’和‘摧毁’敌人。”劳动报提醒读者注意美国在地中海的活动称：“美国在地中海的所作所为，正足以证明美帝国主义的贪得无厌。它急于要扑灭希腊人民的反抗，竭力增加对土耳其反动政权的支持。并派遣更多的援军到地中海，以图实行其新的冒险阴谋”。劳动报并指出：“美国反动派的这种手忙脚乱，正反映出华尔街统治者对地中海地区广大人民日益增长的反抗表示焦急”。
