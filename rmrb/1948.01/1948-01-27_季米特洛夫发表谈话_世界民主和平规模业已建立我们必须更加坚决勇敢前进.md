　　Dimitrov Speaks
  　The Scale of World Democracy and Peace Has Been Established; We Must Advance More Firmly and Bravely
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Bucharest dispatch: Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov, after signing the Bulgarian-Romanian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, held a press conference here and stated, "The international significance of the Bulgarian-Romanian treaty is very significant. This indicates that not only in the Balkans and the Danube River basin, but even throughout Europe and the world, a lasting foundation for the edifice of future democracy and peace has been established." Dimitrov solemnly pointed out, "In order to further consolidate the anti-imperialist front in the Balkans, we must advance more resolutely and courageously along the path of genuine people's democracy, consolidate the national economy so as to finally eliminate all dependence on foreign countries, and systematically eliminate the roots of all fascist reactionaries and foreign agents." Dimitrov stated, "We are extremely willing to establish economic cooperation and trade relations with Western countries, but we will never allow foreign monopoly capital to dictate to us. It must be based on equality and mutual benefit." Dimitrov also explained that the governments of Bulgaria and Romania have decided to build several large bridges on the Danube River, which serves as the boundary between the two countries. This is of great significance not only for Bulgaria and Romania, but also for the economic and political development of the countries along the Danube River and even throughout Europe.
