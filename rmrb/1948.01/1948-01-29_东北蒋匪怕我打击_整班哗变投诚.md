Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th: Under the victorious and awe-inspiring power of the People's Liberation Army's winter offensive, the morale of Chiang's bandit troops is increasingly depressed. Soldiers have moved from sporadic defections to small-scale mutinies. In early last month, the 3rd Squad of the 1st Platoon of the 2nd Company of the 1st Battalion of the 60th Army Manpower Transport Regiment near Jilin mutinied as an entire squad, killing the platoon deputy Su Chunming, and dragging out one Type 92 machine gun and four rifles. The 8th Squad of the 2nd Platoon of the 1st Company of the Engineer Battalion of the Temporary 21st Division of that army mutinied, killing the squad leader Qian Zhenye, and dragging out one Canadian machine gun and two rifles, and defected to our army. On the 24th of last month, the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the Temporary 55th Division of the 49th Army of Xinmin was being transported by train to Dahutun. When they arrived near the Liutiaogou railway bridge, they discovered that the bridge had been destroyed. When the train stopped, more than half of the entire battalion of 360 men ran away. Within four days, 66 Chiang bandits from Faku brought weapons and defected to our army. Many junior officers of Chiang's bandits also fled to the liberated areas. Last month, nine Chiang bandit lieutenants in Siping successively defected to our garrison in Bamiancheng. Among those who came to defect to our army from Changchun, three Chiang bandit air force mechanics, Ma Jie and others, were also found. In addition, there have also been small-scale mutinies in Fu bandits' units in Chahar Province, because they are unwilling to be cannon fodder for the Fu bandits. In the past month alone, more than 40 people including Wu Bishan of the 2nd Cavalry Column, more than 40 people including Guo Si of the 9th Regiment of the 5th Cavalry Brigade, more than 30 people including Yu Zhanhai of the puppet Chahar Provincial Cavalry First Column, and more than 20 people including Song Si of the puppet Huade County Police Team have successively mutinied.
