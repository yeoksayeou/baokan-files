　　Landlords in Hanjia Garden Create Fake Peasant Association
  　Tie Up and Beat Poor Peasants, Rule the Masses
    [Huolu News] The three major landlords in Hanjia Garden have been riding on the backs of the peasants and oppressing the poor for many years. Recently, upon hearing that the hired and poor peasants were about to rise up and completely turn things over, the landlord bullies resorted to conspiracies, threatening and utilizing their lackeys to establish a fake peasant association and undermine land reform. The landlord Zhang Shengui bribed the rogue Zhang Gougou to be the deputy village chief, and also ordered Zhang Hongniu, the landlord's family manager, to be the head of the peasant association. The landlord Zhang Ersheng pretended to be "enlightened," giving Zhang Jinzi thirteen mu of land, telling him to be his lackey. The power in this village was completely controlled by the three major landlords. The fake "Peasant Association" praised the landlords, saying, "The wealthy are doing good deeds, giving all their land to the masses." They also feigned sincerity, saying, "Just leave a little bit for their family to live on."

    Before the New Year, the work team arrived in the village. They discovered the landlord's trickery and ignored the fake "Peasant Association," personally staying in the homes of poor peasants, eating and working with them. Starting from reminiscing about the past and discussing family assets, they guided more than ten poor and hired households to tell of the landlords' crimes. The poor peasants revealed that the landlord Zhang Jingyu and others had raped ×××'s wife in turns, and led the tying up and beating of three poor peasants. The landlord Zhang Sansheng refused to pay public grain and made the poor pay for him. The cowherd Feng Fasheng became ill while herding cows for his family and couldn't even drink a mouthful of rice soup. The villagers sent him a bowl of soup, but the landlord cursed, "Is Fasheng your father? Why are you serving him?" The work team used bitterness to evoke bitterness, and the suffering of the poor and hired was truly endless. An old woman with white hair grabbed Comrade Yang's sleeve and said, "Brother! With you here, I have family! Look at my leg, I haven't been able to move for twenty years, it was injured by the landlord!..." Many poor women, with tears in their eyes, urgently requested the Communist Party to lead them in abolishing the fake peasant association and completely turning things over. (Yu Qing, Xu Ting)

  　捆打贫农统治群众
    【获鹿消息】韩家园三个大地主，骑在农民头上压迫穷人老多年啦，最近听到雇贫农民要起来彻底闹翻身。地主恶霸就摆布阴谋手段，威胁利用狗腿子，成立假农会，破坏土地改革。地主张盛贵收买流氓张狗狗当副村长，又叫地主当家的张红牛当农会长。地主张二盛，假装“开明”，给张金子十三亩地，叫替他当狗腿子。这村大权完全掌握在三家大地主手里，假“农会”就替地主吹捧，说是“财主行善，拿出全部土地分给群众”。还装蒜说：“随便给他家留下点子生活就行。”
    新年前工作员到村里，发现了地主捣鬼，不理假“农会”，亲自住到贫农家里，吃饭干活，从扯时光摆家当，引导十多户贫雇诉出地主的罪恶，贫农说出地主张景玉等曾轮奸过×××的老婆，领头捆打三个贫农。地主张三盛，不出公粮叫穷人替他出。牛工冯发生，给他家放牛弄病了，连口米汤也不能喝，乡亲们给送去一碗汤。地主就骂：“发生是你爹吗，为啥伺候他”？工作员以苦引苦，贫雇的痛苦真是说不尽。一位白发苍苍的老太婆，扯住干部杨同志的衣袖说：“兄弟呀！你们来了我就有了亲人啦！你看我这腿二十年不能动弹，就是被地主的伤呀！……”许多贫苦妇女，都含着眼泪，迫切要求共产党领导她们取消假农会，彻底闹翻身。（玉清、绪亭）
