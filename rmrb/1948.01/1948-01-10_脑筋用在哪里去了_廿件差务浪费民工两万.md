　　Where Did Their Brains Go?
　　Twenty Tasks Waste 20,000 Laborers
　　[Our News] Some staff members eat their fill all day long, without using their minds at all. They put on airs of bureaucracy and do not care about the interests of the people, causing over twenty tasks to waste more than 20,000 laborers. The Yuabei Special Commissioner's Office of Taiyue has reviewed this serious situation. On December 11th, the Yuabei Special Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of dispatch officers from ten counties in the district. After seven days of reporting, discussion, and research, they rigorously criticized the erroneous thinking of "handling official business as official business" that had existed in the past in dispatch work, which led to a failure to use their minds and find solutions, resulting in serious waste in dispatch tasks. During the reports at the meeting, among the twenty-four examples cited by nine counties, due to unnecessary or random requests, poorly planned, unclear collection points, requesting more than needed, weighing shortages or putting on airs when the warehouse received grain, cadres leading laborers being irresponsible or insisting on doing the impossible, careless writing in official documents and phone calls when allocating tasks, and mechanically executing dispatch systems, there was a waste of 22,736 laborers and 505 animal labor days. For example, this year, more than 10,000 dan of public grain in Pingjie were moved to the mountains using more than 10,000 laborers. Because it was not carefully considered, the grain was concentrated in one place. When the enemy became active in the mountains, more than 10,000 laborers were used to disperse it again. In November, Qinyuan requested 122 laborers from the first district to carry electric poles to the Dalin area. The phone call said to cut electric poles, but the laborers returned without carrying them. As a result, another 120 people were sent. In September, Nanbu Station requested 50 donkeys from Huo County, but after using them all, they even returned 11 extras. Two family members of the Fourth Column, from Fushan to Anze and Shan, requested three donkeys for the two of them, carrying flowers, salt, and other items for production. The Fourth Column's garrison office requested seven carts from Changzi, but they only came to pick up the carts five days after the agreed date, and the laborers waited for five days. Examples like these exist in every county. The comrades leading the dispatch tasks simply followed the procedures without stopping or suggesting any changes. At this point, everyone deeply realized that it was not we who contributed the strength, but the masses who contributed the strength, and we wasted it due to our irresponsibility. Director Liang pointed out in his summary that the most important thing to pay attention to in dispatch tasks today is to use our brains and think more, and not to do work mechanically, doing exactly what is ordered. Secondly, we must strengthen our leadership over districts and villages, and criticize, expose, and punish those who do not cherish labor, and commend the good ones. In terms of ideology, we must make it clear that doing a good job in dispatch work is a good service to the people. We must not adopt an irresponsible attitude.

　　脑筋用在哪里去了
  　廿件差务浪费民工两万
    【本报消息】有些工作人员饱食终日，无所用心，摆官僚主义，不关心人民的利益，闹得二十几次差务就浪费了两万多民工。太岳岳北专署已检讨出这种严重的事实。岳北专署于十二月十一日召开全区十县差务干事会议，经过七天的汇报讨论研究，严格地批判了由于过去在差务工作上存在着“公事公办”的错误思想，因而不开动机器不想办法，造成了差务上的严重浪费现象。只在会议上大家汇报时，九个县所举的二十四个例子当中，由于不该要乱要、计划不周到、集合地弄不清、用不了多要、仓库收粮时秤少或摆架子、带民工干部不负责任办不到硬办、拨差时写公事和电话上马虎和机械执行差务制度等，就浪费民力两万二千七百三十六个，牲口工五百零五个。就大的例子说：今年平介一万多石公粮，用一万多民工移到山上，因一时没考虑好就集中放起来，到敌人活动到山上时，才又用一万多民工分散了。十一月份沁源向一区要一百二十二个民工到大林区扛电杆，电话上说成砍电杆，民工去后不扛就回来了，结果又派了一百二十人。九月份南堡兵站向霍县要了五十个毛驴，去后尽用了还长回十一个。四纵队两个家属，从浮山到安泽和山，两个人要了三个毛驴，驮着花盐等东西搞生产。四纵留守处向长子要七辆大车，结果到约定日期的五天后才来带车，民工就等了五天。象这样的例子各县都有，领导办差的同志，只照样行事，既不制止，又不建议。至此大家深刻认识到我们不是拿出了力量，而是群众拿出的力量，我们不负责任而浪费了它。梁主任在总结中最后指出：今天在差务上必须首先注意的是要用脑子多考虑，决不是机器式的做工作，叫做多少就做多少。其次要抓紧对区村的领导，对不爱惜民力的要批评、揭发、处罚，好的表扬。在思想上要明确了做好差务工作，就是很好的为人民服了务。不能采取不负责的态度。
