　　Shuimen Village's Poor and Hired Laborers Fail to Overcome Poverty
　　"Cultivate Three, Retain One" is a Rich Peasant Route
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] In the past, Xingtai's Shuimen Village was a "production model." Judging from the village's overall income and expenditure, it achieved "cultivate three, retain one" this year. A further examination of the actual income and expenditure of each class reveals a significant difference. The 43 old middle-peasant households had an average surplus of 8.5 *dou* of grain per person; among them, the 14 upper-middle peasant households had an average surplus of 1.28 *shi* of grain. The richest household had an average surplus of 1.5 *shi* of grain per person. The 58 poor and hired laborer households had an average surplus of 5.7 *dou* of grain per person, just reaching "cultivate three, retain one"; among them, 20 households had an average surplus of only 3.6 *dou* of grain, barely enough to be self-sufficient. The 14 landlord households had a total income of 115 *shi*, with an average surplus of 2.2 *dou* of grain per person, while the six households that had declined into the middle-peasant category had an average surplus of 9.8 *dou* of grain per person; the three rich peasant households had an average surplus of 1.49 *shi* of grain per person.
　　Looking at the peasants: the old middle peasants had the most surplus, but when looking at the entire poor and hired laborer class, they only just achieved "cultivate three, retain one," and 20 lower-middle peasant households were only self-sufficient. Looking at the landlords and rich peasants: their surplus was not much, but the ones who declined into the middle-peasant category and the rich peasants all exceeded "cultivate three, retain one." When statistics were taken by household, 13 households of poor and hired laborers were only just self-sufficient, and five households were not self-sufficient; among the old middle peasants, 15 households were only just self-sufficient, and two households were not self-sufficient; among the landlords and rich peasants, two households reached "cultivate one, retain one."
　　The fundamental reason for the above phenomenon is that the unreasonable situation in the ownership and distribution of production means by each class still exists seriously. This shows that the land reform in the old liberated areas is still not thorough. The old middle peasants occupy more irrigated land, livestock, and agricultural tools; the poor and hired laborers, because they have not been thoroughly liberated, generally lack land and production capital. Some of the landlords and rich peasants, especially those who have changed their appearance or the rich peasants, have not been properly liquidated. They only offered some bad land and still own irrigated land and livestock exceeding the village average. From the comparison of the occupancy of irrigated land, output, and livestock in the whole village: the old middle peasants have an average of 0.7 *mu* of irrigated land per person, with an output of 2.46 *shi*, and each head of livestock cultivates an average of 5.5 *mu* of land; the poor and hired laborer class has an average of 0.46 *mu* of irrigated land, with an output of 2.23 *shi*, and each livestock cultivates an average of 9 *mu* of land; the landlords and rich peasants have an average of 0.64 *mu* of irrigated land (second only to the middle peasants), with an output of 1.65 *shi*, and each livestock cultivates an average of 10 *mu* of land; and the three rich peasant households have an average of 1.3 *mu* of irrigated land, with an output of 3.85 *shi*. Secondly, the village's class viewpoint is vague in production work, and not enough attention is paid to the interests of the poor and hired laborers. For example, in agricultural vegetable matters, the general average wage is suppressed, causing the poor and hired laborers to suffer. The exchange of labor for side occupations and agriculture in Group 5 is not equivalent. The cooperative only pays attention to helping middle peasants buy livestock and turns a blind eye to the lack of livestock of the vast number of poor and hired peasants, making the poor and hired laborer class have to exchange unequal labor with other classes in agricultural and sideline production.
　　In addition, after the poor and hired laborer class have been newly liberated, the replenishment of various means of production and the necessary household construction cost a lot, which is not included in the calculation. If this consumption is included, the actual surplus of the poor and hired laborers will be even less. Therefore, there is a big question as to whether the entire poor and hired laborer class can really reach "cultivate three, retain one." This calculation of "cultivate three, retain one" does not include clothing and daily necessities. The village's income mainly relies on fruit trees and sideline income, and grain income only accounts for 48% of the total income. And whether the surplus can all be turned into grain is still a question. From these materials, it can also be explained that achieving "cultivate three, retain one" is not the goal of the poor and hired peasants' struggle. More important is to solve their liberation problem.

　　This investigation material shows that land has not been thoroughly distributed equally, and advocating "cultivate three, retain one" is a rich peasant route. We hope that the comrades who conducted the investigation and the comrades who studied this material will continue to provide opinions on whether the class analysis method in the investigation is correct. --Editor

### 水门贫雇没翻身　耕三余一是富农路线

　　水门贫雇没翻身
  　耕三余一是富农路线
    【本报消息】邢台水门村过去是“生产模范”，从全村总的收支上看，今年达到了“耕三余一”。进一步从各阶层的实际收支检查，相差很大。老中农共四十三户，每人平均余粮八斗五升；而其中上中农十四户，平均余粮一石二斗八。最富的一户，平均每人余粮一石五斗。贫雇阶层五十八户，每人平均余粮五斗七升，刚达到“耕三余一”；而其中二十户，只平均余粮三斗六升，仅能自给。地主十四户，总收入一百十五石，每人平均余粮二斗二升，而其中降中六户，平均每人余粮九斗八升；富农三户，平均每人余粮一石四斗九。
    从农民中看：剩余最多的是老中农，但从整个贫雇阶层看：刚达到了“耕三余一”，但其中有二十户下中却仅足自给。再从地主富农方面看：所余不多，但其中之降中和富农却都超过了“耕三余一”。如以户为单位，分别统计：贫雇层尚有十三户仅够自给，五户自给不足；老中农中十五户仅足自给，二户自给不足；地主富农中尚有二户达到“耕一余一”。
    造成以上现象的基本原因：首先是各阶层生产手段占有和分配上不合理的状况依然严重存在。说明老区土地改革仍不彻底。老中农占有较多的水地牲畜和农具；贫雇则由于没有翻透身，普遍缺乏土地及生产资本。地主富农中尚有个别化形的或富农没有受到应有的清算，只献了一部分坏地，仍拥有超过全村平均水准的水地和牲畜。从全村水地占有产量和牲畜占有比较上看：老中农每人平均水地七分，产量二石四斗六，牲畜每头平均耕地五亩五分；贫雇层则平均水地四分六，产量二石二斗三，牲口平均耕地九亩；地主富农平均水地六分四（仅次于中农），产量一石六斗五，牲畜平均耕地十亩；而其中三户富农则平均水地一亩三，产量三石八斗五升。其次由于该村在生产工作中阶级观点模糊，对贫雇利益注意不够。如在农菜上，一般的平均压低工资，致使贫雇吃了亏。五组副业和农业的变工上不等价。合作社只注意帮助中农买牲口，对广大贫雇农的牲口缺乏则熟视无睹，使贫雇阶层不得不在农副业生产中以劳力和其它阶层做不等价的交换。
    加之贫雇阶层新翻身之后，各种生产资料的补充和必要的家务建设花费很大，并未计算在内，如将这笔消耗计算的话，贫雇的实际剩余就更少了。因之整个贫雇阶层是否真能达到耕三余一是个很大的疑问。这一耕三余一的计算，未包括穿衣日用在内，该村收入又主要依靠果木和副业收入，粮食收入只占总收入百分之四十八。而余款是否能够全部变成粮食，还是个问题。从这些材料中亦就可以说明达到耕三余一，还不是贫雇农的奋斗目标，更重要的是解决他们的翻身问题。

    这一调查材料，说明土地未能彻底平分，提倡“耕三余一”就是富农路线，调查中的阶级分析方法是否正确，希望调查的同志与研究这一材料的同志继续提供意见。——编者
