　　[Our newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, 7th dispatch] After our army recovered Changyuan City, the democratic government opened warehouses to relieve the poor according to the demands of the masses. When distributing grain, in order to take care of the poor farmers in the whole city, poor households were first registered, and relief was carried out according to different living conditions. When the warehouse was opened, it was crowded with hungry and poor people. The poor people near the city heard about the opening of the warehouse for relief and rushed over. They complained to the working comrades one after another. Poor peasant Niu Haoli said: "When the Eighth Route Army opened Changyuan before, I received beans and ate them for more than a month. When the Kuomintang army was here, I begged for food every day." Grain was distributed according to living conditions, with some households receiving four dou, and some receiving seven or eight dou. An old man in his seventies, Yan Derong, received several dou of wheat and couldn't carry it. The working comrades helped him deliver it to his home. This time, a total of 18,456 jin of grain was distributed, and more than 2,500 poor people were relieved.

　　长垣市民重见天日民主政府开仓济贫
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】我军收复长垣城后，民主政府根据群众要求，打开仓库，救济穷人。分粮时，为了照顾全城贫苦农民，首先进行贫苦户口登记，根据不同的生活情况，进行救济。当打开仓库时，门前挤满着饥寒贫苦的群众，城附近的贫苦群众听说开仓救济，也赶来了，他们纷纷向工作同志诉苦。贫农牛好礼说：“以前八路打开长垣时，我领了豆子，吃了个多月。国民党军在这里，我天天要饭。”按生活情况发粮，每户有分了四斗的，有分到七、八斗的。七十多岁老汉阎德荣分到几斗麦子背不动，工作同志就帮他送到家里。此次共发粮一万八千四百五十六斤，二千五百余穷人得到救济。
