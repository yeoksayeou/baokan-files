　　Penetrating Deep Behind Enemy Lines to Annihilate an Enemy Company
　　Military Region Commends Yuci Independent Battalion
    [Our Dispatch] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region issued a circular today, commending the 1st Company of the Yuci Independent Battalion for penetrating deep behind enemy lines and actively killing the enemy. This unit penetrated the rear of the Yan bandit forces at dawn on the 8th of this month, setting up an ambush in Dongzhuangzi Village, Yuci. On that day, a new recruit company from the 3rd Regiment of the 8th Column of Yan Xishan's bandit army came out of Yuci City, intending to plunder grain from Zhuangzi Village. After only 20 minutes of combat, they were completely wiped out by our ambushing troops. A total of eight enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, twenty-four captured, and eleven rifles, one hundred and sixty rounds of ammunition, and six bayonets were seized. We suffered no casualties. It was truly a well-fought battle of annihilation.

　　深入敌后歼敌一连
  　军区表扬榆次独立营
    【本报消息】晋冀鲁豫军区今天发了一个通令，表扬深入敌后，积极杀敌的榆次独立营一连。这部分队伍在本月八日天刚明的时候伸入阎匪后方，在榆次东庄子村定下了埋伏，那天阎锡山匪军八总三团一个新兵连从榆次城出来，想到庄子村抢粮，只经过廿分钟战斗，就被我伏兵全部解决了，共总打死打伤敌八名，俘廿四名，缴步枪十一支，子弹一百六十发，剌刀六把，我们没有一个伤亡。真是打得好的一个歼灭战。
