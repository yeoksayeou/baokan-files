(Xinhua News Agency, Su, Lu, Yu, and Wan Front, 12th) Li Yingcai, Chief of Staff of Chiang's Fifth Army Corps Headquarters, and others, before laying down their arms in the Pinghan Southern Line Campaign, denounced Chiang's crimes of instigating civil war and, filled with righteous indignation, jointly telegraphed their defection from the Kuomintang. The telegram begins with a somber reflection, saying: "We eat the people's food, wear the people's clothes, and use the people's resources, but for whom are we fighting? And against whom?" After denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's crimes, it continues: "The Chinese Kuomintang has become a tool of the murdering demon. Today, we announce our departure from the Kuomintang monopolized by Chiang Kai-shek with boundless grief and indignation." The telegram was signed by twenty-five general and field grade officers, including: Li Yingcai, Major General and Chief of Staff of the Fifth Army Corps; Sun Yan, Major General and Deputy Chief of Staff; Lu Kezhen, Major General and Deputy Division Commander of the 3rd Reorganized Division; Rao Yabo, Colonel and Chief of Staff of the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Reorganized Division; Li Bingyao, Colonel and Chief of Staff of the 16th Sub-Supervisory Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters; Shen Binghong, Lieutenant Colonel and Chief of Staff of the 20th Brigade of the 3rd Reorganized Division; Zhang Tingzhong, Colonel and Chief of Personnel Section of the Fifth Army Corps Headquarters; and Fang Yongji, Colonel and Secretary.
