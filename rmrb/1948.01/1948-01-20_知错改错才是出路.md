　　Knowing and Correcting Mistakes is the Only Way Out
　　After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the Border Region Government also issued measures to punish those who sabotage land reform. This order from the Border Region Government means that no one can disobey the Land Law Outline. If some people have done wrong things in the past, they become afraid when they hear today's laws, fearing that the masses will deal with them according to the law. These people used to be lawless, had no regard for the masses, took too much fruit, and had bad work styles. Today, understanding the fear of the law and the masses is a transformation. But being afraid should lead them to admit their mistakes to the masses, return the fruit, and change their work styles. As long as they do this, the masses can forgive them and will give these people a chance to correct their mistakes. There is no need to panic and be suspicious. As for some people who still want to take advantage of the fact that the poor peasant leagues and peasant representative conferences have not yet been organized, and don't want to honestly admit their mistakes and return the fruit; on the contrary, they are still secretly burying or selling things. Some are indulging in extravagant eating and drinking to sabotage. Still others are using more subtle methods. They are afraid that the poor peasant leagues will give them opinions, so they secretly bribe poor peasants and give them "donations." These actions are even more foolish. The previous mistakes have not been resolved, and they are committing crimes of sabotaging land reform again. The more they do this, the worse the outcome will be. Crimes found today will be punished today (some people think that crimes cannot be punished today because the people's court has not been established yet, which is wrong, and should be stopped according to the law). Crimes found in the future will be punished in the future. We hope these people will be honest immediately and not add mistakes to mistakes. Finally, we earnestly tell these people that only by being honest, admitting past mistakes, returning the fruit they have taken too much of, and compensating for what they have embezzled, and being able to honestly correct mistakes, can they have a way out. Only those who do not admit their mistakes and act recklessly will not be forgiven by the masses.

　　知错改错才是出路
    土地法大纲发表后，边区政府又发表了破坏土地改革的治罪的办法；边区政府的这一道命令，就是说谁也不能不按土地法大纲办事；如有的人过去做了些错事，听到今天的法令，便害怕起来，怕群众依法办他们。这些人过去无法无天，目无群众，多占果实，作风不好，今天懂得了怕法令怕群众，是个转变；但害怕就应该向群众承认错误，退出果实，改变作风，只要如此，群众是可以原谅的，会给这些人以改正错误的机会的，用不着惊惶失措，疑神疑鬼。至于有的人还想趁贫农团、农代会没有组织起来以前钻空子，不想老老实实承认错误，退出果实；相反的还在那里把东西偷偷埋藏起来或者卖出去，有的大吃大喝进行破坏，还有的用的办法更巧妙，他们害怕贫农团给他们提意见，便暗中收买贫农，给贫农“捐款”。这些行动更是糊涂，以前的错误还没解决，便又来犯破坏土地改革的罪，越这样干下去，越没有好下场。今天查出，今天办罪，（有些人以为今天没有成立了人民法庭便不能办罪是不对的，应该依法制止。）将来查出，将来办罪。希望这些人立刻老实起来，不要错上加错。最后我们很恳切的告诉这些人，只有老老实实，过去做错了的认错，多拿了果实的退出，贪污了的赔偿。有了错误能老实改正，就一定有出路，只有不认错而又胡闹的人，是群众不能原谅的。
