Guns Should Not Be Used to Cheaply Buy Printing Presses
　　Jinnan Daily Must Conduct a Serious Investigation
    [This Newspaper Reported] On December 22nd of last year, the Xin Shimen Daily, published in Shijiazhuang City, ran a news item titled "Protecting Industry and Commerce," which roughly stated: "Chang Furen, the acting manager of Zhongxing Stationery Store in this city, had previously listened to the nonsense of the Chiang bandits. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, he feared that business would be difficult and intended to sell his printing machines (eight-page letterpress machine, etc.) and materials. Coincidentally, a purchasing agent from Jinnan Daily went to buy them, setting the price at 42 million yuan (the actual price should be 6 million yuan). A contract was drawn up, and 300,000 yuan of border currency was paid as a deposit. Due to martial law, the machines were not transported. Later, the Materials Management Committee found out about this and asked him why he was selling them so cheaply. He said: 'Firstly, I wanted to sell at the time, and secondly, people in military uniforms carrying guns came twice, and I was afraid not to sell. The deal was final, and besides, I had already signed a contract with them, so what could I say?' In order to protect urban industry and commerce from damage, the Management Committee told him to disregard the contract and return the money to Jinnan Daily and not sell the machines." Upon seeing this news, the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region immediately notified propaganda organs in all districts to conduct a serious investigation based on this news to see if there were similar cases of seizing opportunities in newly liberated cities, only caring about oneself, disregarding the masses, and harming the people and the interests of industry and commerce. It also sent a telegram to the Jinnan District Party Committee, instructing Jinnan Daily to conduct a strict investigation into this matter and publish it openly in the newspaper.

　　不应带枪贱买印刷机
  　冀南日报社要认真检查
    【本报讯】去年十二月二十二日石家庄市出版的新石门日报以“保护工商业”为题，登了一条消息，大略说：“本市中兴文具店代理掌柜常辅仁过去听了蒋匪胡说，石家庄解放后，他害怕生意不好干，便要把自己的印刷机器（八页铅印机等）和材料卖掉。恰巧有冀南日报的采办员去买，说定价钱四千二百万元，（实价须六百万元）立了合同，先付三十万元边币定钱，因戒严关系，机器没有运出。后来给物资管理委员会查出来，问他为什么这样贱卖掉，他说：‘一则当时想卖，一则人家穿军衣带枪的连来两次，不卖怕不行。买卖是一言为定，况且已和人家立了合同，还有什么说的？’管委会为了保护城市工商业不受损害，便叫他不用管合同不合同，把钱退还冀南日报，机器别卖了。”晋冀鲁豫中央局宣传部看到这条消息，立即通知各区宣传机关，根据这条消息认真去检查有没有同样到新解放城市抓一把，光顾自己，不顾群众，损害人民，损害工商业利益的事。并打电报给冀南区党委，让冀南日报就这件事作严格检查，公开在报上发表。
