The Valiant People of Eastern Chahar Fight Courageously

　　Soon after the People's Liberation Army withdrew from the Ping-Sui Railway line last year, the bandit Fu [Fu Zuoyi] occupied Zhao Chuan Fort, Longguan, Chicheng, and Diaobao with 50,000 troops, pressing towards Chongli, Yanqing, and Yongning, and opened up the highways from Zhao Chuan to Longguan, Chicheng to Diaobao, Yanjia Ping to Yanqing, and Huailai, dividing eastern Chahar into several small pieces in all directions. However, the people of eastern Chahar did not retreat because of the harsh environment. On the contrary, they fought the enemy more heroically. In the freezing weather, cadres of the democratic government, in coordination with local military groups, used fire to melt the frozen earth, buried landmines, and bombed the enemy, constantly shooting at them. A militiaman in Longguan, in order to monitor the enemy on the mountain, had his feet frozen to his shoes. When he took them off, his skin and flesh came off with them.

　　Under the heroic resistance of the people, the bandit Fu, in order to protect the Ping-Sui Railway and control eastern Chahar, used two divisions to repeatedly "mop up" and "suppress" areas such as Longguan, Chicheng, Huailai, and Yanqing. Last winter, when the enemy "mopped up" the old base areas of eastern Chahar, such as Jining Fort, Damiaozi, Shitou Fort, and Yantong Temple villages, they burned every house they saw in every small ditch and village, smashed every pot, and burned down even the houses that the Japanese invaders had not destroyed during the War of Resistance. The people fought heroically with the enemy. The people of Jining Fort and other places refused to go down the mountain for three days without food. Zhao Shun, a famous model of supporting the army in northern Hebei, led the militia of Yingzhuangzi to fight the enemy three times in ten days, which ultimately prevented the enemy from entering the village. Cadres of the democratic government and the people sometimes ate cold food in the snow and sometimes marched through the snowy mountains all night during the anti-"mopping up" campaign, without wavering. Comrade Wang, a cadre in the seventh district of Huailai, who insisted on working in Babao Mountain, was caught by enemy agents, taken to the security office, hung on a tree, and had his muscles cut with a knife, causing him to bleed profusely, but he did not say a word and finally died heroically. After the heroic and arduous struggle of the people, all the enemy's "mopping up" operations finally failed. The Chicheng militia independently fought 287 battles in half a year, killing and capturing 517 Chiang-Fu bandits, and removing more than a dozen large and small strongholds such as Muling, besieging the enemy in several isolated strongholds. Since last autumn, in order to make a final struggle, the Chiang-Fu bandits created inhumane "no-man's-lands" in Chongli and other border areas, driving all peaceful residents, men, women, old and young, from the villages into "human circles," scattering pigs, dogs, cattle, and sheep, and leaving the courtyards in the villages overgrown with weeds. The people who were driven into the "human circles" were without clothes or food, suffering from hunger and cold. Men were captured to serve as soldiers, and women were brutally raped. However, after the heroic struggle of the people of eastern Chahar, under the cover of the main forces, the masses, supporting the old and carrying the young, escaped from the "human circles," and the "no-man's-lands" have been revitalized, creating an isolated siege of the enemy's strongholds, forcing the enemy on the Diaobao to Huaiqing highway to retreat, besieging strongholds such as Longguan and Zhao Chuan Fort, and returning large areas of eastern Chahar to the hands of the people. Recently, local armed forces have been constantly launching active and extensive attacks on the enemy. The Huailai local armed forces set fire to the city gate of Huailai; the Chongli local armed forces annihilated more than 120 enemies in one battle; the democratic government of the Yanqing area has approached the city gate, and even our staff are frequently active in areas more than ten miles outside Zhangjiakou. Under the siege of the people's army, the bandit Fu is terrified.

　　英勇斗争的察东人民
    当前年解放军退出平绥线不久，傅匪即以五万大军占领了赵川堡、龙关、赤城、雕堡，进迫崇礼、延庆、永宁，并打通赵川至龙关；赤城至雕堡、阎家坪至延庆、怀来各公路，把察东分成东西南北若干小块。但是察东人民并没有因为环境残酷而退缩，相反的他们更英勇的和敌人进行搏斗。在冰天雪地里，民主政府的干部协同地方兵团曾用火将冻了的土地化开，埋下地雷，爆炸敌人。不断射击敌人。龙关的一个民兵为了在山上监视敌人，把脚都冻的贴在鞋上，回来一脱，皮肉都掉下来。
    在人民英勇抗击下，傅匪为了保护平绥路，控制察东，曾用两个师兵力，反复“扫荡”、“清剿”龙关、赤城、怀来、延庆等地区。前年冬天敌人“扫荡”察东老根据地纪宁堡、大庙子、石头堡、烟筒寺等村时，每一小沟，小村见房便烧，有锅便打，将抗战中日寇未曾烧毁的房屋也烧得精光，人民英勇的和敌人搏斗，纪宁堡等地人民，三天不吃东西也不下山。有名的平北拥军模范，六十多岁的老人赵顺，曾率领英庄子民兵与敌人在十天中战斗三次，终使敌人未敢进庄。民主政府的干部和人民在反“扫荡”时，有时在雪地里吃冷饭，有时彻夜在雪山中行进，毫不动摇。坚持八宝山工作的怀来七区干部王同志，被敌特抓住，带到保安，吊在树上，用刀割身上肌肉、鲜血直流，但他只字不吐，最后仍然英勇就义。经过人民英勇的艰苦奋斗，敌人的一切“扫荡”终于失败。赤城民兵在半年中曾独立作战二百八十七次，毙俘蒋傅匪军五百一十七名，拔除墓岭等大小据点十余处，将敌人围困在几个孤立据点内。去年入秋以来，蒋傅匪为了最后挣扎，曾在崇礼等边沿区制造惨无人道的“无人区”，将男女老幼所有和平居民从村中赶入“人圈”、猪、狗、牛、羊四散，村中庭院野草丛生。而被赶到“人圈”的人民，则无衣无食，饥寒交迫，男子被抓去当兵，妇女惨遭奸污。但经过察东人民英勇奋斗，在大部队的掩护下，群众扶老携幼从“人圈”逃回，“无人区”已重新恢复活跃气象，反过来造成对敌据点的孤立围困，逼退了雕堡到怀庆公路上的敌人，围困了龙关、赵川堡等据点，使察东广大地区重入人民之手。最近各地方武装不断主动广泛出击敌人。怀来地武曾火烧怀来城门；崇礼地武一次即歼敌百二十余；延庆地区民主政府工作已逼近城关，甚至张家口十里以外地区经常也有我们工作人员活动。在人民大军群起围攻下，傅匪胆战心惊。
