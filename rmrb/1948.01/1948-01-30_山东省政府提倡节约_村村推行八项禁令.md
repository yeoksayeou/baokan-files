Xinhua News Agency, East China, January 25th: The Shandong Provincial Government announced eight prohibitions and ten requirements before New Year's Day, ordering everyone to publicize and every village to implement them in order to reduce the people's burden, actively engage in production and thrift, get through the spring famine, ensure the completion of land reform, and strive for victory in the people's revolutionary war.

The eight prohibitions are: 1. Ban extravagant eating and drinking; simplify banquets and gift-giving. Practice thrift and learn from poor peasants in all aspects of life. 2. Ban apportionment; prohibit all extra burdens. All village finances must be discussed, inspected, and supervised by the masses and approved by governments above the county level. 3. No conscription is allowed without the decision of the military region or the provincial government. 4. Ban raising money for comfort missions. 5. Ban private occupation of floating wealth and fruits; ban corruption, waste, destruction, occupation, transfer, or theft of floating wealth and public property. Offenders will be punished with hard labor and compensation. 6. Ban the slaughter and injury of draught cattle and the destruction of farm tools. 7. Ban the free assignment of labor, wasting people's strength, and freezing labor. From now on, the mobilization and use of civilian labor must comply with government regulations. All frozen labor must be sent back to production. 8. Ban corruption, waste, and loss of public grain and public grass; ban false reporting and excessive collection. From now on, those who are found to have falsely reported and excessively collected public grain and public grass will be held accountable along with the leaders of the affiliated agency. Finally, it is stipulated that any citizen has the democratic right to report and supervise violations of the prohibitions, and those who infringe on this democratic right will be punished twice as severely.

The ten requirements are: 1. Disaster areas (i.e., areas once occupied and ravaged by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits) should eat bran and wild herbs in winter to save grain, so that there will be grain to plant and work in the fields next spring. 2. Every household should plant spring vegetables early to supplement grain, so as not to regret it when there is a shortage of grain and vegetables. 3. Fields and spring land should be planted with vegetables in stages, so as not to have another disaster when the old crops run out and the new crops are not yet ready. 4. Protect elm, willow, poplar, and locust trees, so there will be tree vegetables to eat next spring. 5. Plant more spring wheat and spring corn, so that the summer wheat will not fail and affect the autumn harvest. 6. Government agencies and troops should help more in their spare time, and the masses should not comfort them with every meal or drop of porridge. 7. Every household should practice thrift and develop production, and not just eat today without regard for tomorrow. 8. Hired and poor peasants should share the fruits of struggle, and cadres should not be corrupt or monopolize them. 9. Understand that the fruits of struggle are originally the blood and sweat of hired and poor peasants, and should not be regarded as external wealth and used improperly. 10. Organize cattle raising and make cattle available fairly, so that cattle owners do not suffer losses and sell their cattle, leaving land without cattle to plow.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, January 25th: Cadres of organs in the Binhai area have begun to respond to the Shandong Provincial Government's eight prohibitions and ten requirements. The Binhai Pictorial has published a special issue to publicize them in depth. After receiving the prohibitions, the Ju County government immediately reprinted and distributed them, and required all villages to hold discussions and reflections in winter schools to achieve implementation in every village. The Cultural and Education Office of Rizhao County compiled the prohibitions into songs and sent them to elementary schools to teach the masses. Cadres of district offices in Jufeng District and Luyang District of Zhuting (newly established county, formerly Ganyu County) reviewed themselves based on the prohibitions and formulated future production and thrift plans. After studying the prohibitions, cadres of the southern border area of Ju (County) turned over all of their three-month surplus vegetable money, more than 40,000 yuan, and more than 700 jin of coarse grains to the public. Cadres and militiamen in Dadian Town, Dadian District, automatically proposed to strictly prohibit extravagant eating and drinking and immediately carried manure baskets to engage in production. Cadres in Pingshang Village collectively quit drinking and made self-criticisms to the villagers, asking for their supervision.
