　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has gained valuable experience through the mass line in cultivating models. Ren Jizhen, deputy platoon leader of the unit, from Yishui, Shandong, and of peasant origin, has consistently worked actively since joining the army, and has therefore been repeatedly selected as a "model" and meritorious worker. The unit even issued a circular to the entire column to learn from him. However, just as the column was launching the Ren Jizhen campaign, it was discovered that there were various slanders against Ren Jizhen in the company. Some soldiers also began to doubt Ren's exemplary actions, and the rumors became more and more numerous. After the leadership discovered this, they immediately investigated, conducting individual interviews and forums to clarify the facts. At the forums, soldiers who had been helped by Comrade Ren Jizhen refuted many of the strange rumors slandering Ren Jizhen based on the facts and promoted his hard-working style. The investigation revealed that this dissatisfaction was mainly due to: First, the leadership neglected to praise and encourage the general masses, thus creating an isolated model, detached from the masses, and causing internal disobedience and jealousy. For example, Sun Dejun, one of those who created this disturbance, originally learned from Ren Jizhen and admired him very much. However, after he and Ren Jizhen retrieved machine gun parts together, the leadership only praised Ren and did not praise Sun. Similarly, after the summer offensive, Ren Jizhen and the company clerk Zhang Xiangming participated in mass work together. The leadership only awarded Ren Jizhen the title of "Peasant Meritorious Worker" and recorded a special merit, while not mentioning Zhang at all. Later, although Zhang Xiangming's merit was supplemented, it had already aroused Zhang's dissatisfaction. Second, in the process of cultivating and creating models, there was a tendency to "abandon the old for the new." For example, Feng Baoda of the company said: The instructor has talked to him a lot, so it is easy to become a model. But me! I haven’t been talked to even once. Third, the leadership did not appropriately point out the shortcomings of the model itself. For example, Ren Jizhen had two shortcomings before class education (now corrected): one was that if the person being helped did not change after two or three conversations, he would no longer talk to him. The second was that when he discovered violations of discipline, he was blunt and impatient in his methods of stopping them. In the past, when praising Ren Jizhen, only his advantages were praised, and his shortcomings were not pointed out, arousing the dissatisfaction of some of the masses. These show that to implement the mass line in cultivating models, one should not neglect to encourage and praise the general masses when praising models. On the one hand, focus on key points, organize the masses to learn from the model, and create a large number of reserve forces for models. On the other hand, one should not neglect to point out the shortcomings of the model and should actively educate the model through the masses and correct them. This will not only prevent the model from being prominent and isolated, but also can connect with the masses and improve the model.

　　某部取得带兵经验走群众路线创造典型
    【新华社东北十日电】解放军某部经过群众路线培养典型取得宝贵经验。该部副排长任纪贞同志，山东沂水人，雇农出身，入伍后一贯积极工作，因此屡次被选为“模范”及功臣，该部并通令全纵队向他学习。但正当纵队展开任纪贞运动时，发现连队里对任纪贞有种种诽谤，有些战士对任的模范行动也发生怀疑，流言并越来越多，领导上发现后，立即调查，进行个别谈话和座谈会，以弄清事实，座谈会上受过任纪贞同志帮助的战士都根据事实将诽谤任纪贞的许多怪话，一一加以驳斥，并发扬他的艰苦作风。经调查结果，发生这种不满情绪主要是由于：第一领导上忽视了对一般群众的表扬与鼓励，因此造成典型孤立，脱离群众和引起内部的不服与妒忌。如制造这场风波之一的孙德俊，原来是向任纪贞学习，而且对他很佩服的，但他那次与任纪贞一起取回机枪零件后，领导上只表扬了任而没有表扬孙。又如夏季攻势后，任纪贞曾与该连文书张相明一起参加群运，领导上只赠任纪贞为“农民功臣”，记以特功，而对张却一字未提，后来虽替张相明补功，但已引起张的不满。第二、在培养与创造典型过程中，有“有新抛旧”的偏向，如该连冯保达说：指导员和他谈过很多话，当然容易成为模范，我呢！一次话也没谈过。第三、领导上对典型本身存在的缺点没有适当的加以指出，如任纪贞在阶级教育前，有两个缺点：（现在已经改正）一是对被帮助者如果经过两三次谈话没有转变，他就不再找他谈了。二是当他发现有违犯纪律现象时，在制止的方法上表现生硬急燥。过去表扬任纪贞时，只表扬优点，而不指出他的缺点，引起一部分群众的不服。这些说明要贯彻群众路线培养典型，在表扬典型时不应忽视对一般群众的鼓励与表扬，一方面抓住重点，组织群众向典型学习，创造出大批典型的后备军，另方面应不忽视指出典型的缺点，应积极通过群众，教育典型，加以纠正。这样既不致使典型突出孤立，而且能联系群众，提高典型。
