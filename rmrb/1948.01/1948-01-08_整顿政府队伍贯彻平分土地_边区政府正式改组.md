　　Reorganize Government Ranks, Implement Equal Land Distribution
  　Border Region Government Formally Reorganized
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Border Region Government was formally reorganized on the morning of the 5th of this month. At the reorganization meeting, Chairman Yang, with a spirit of self-criticism, conducted a rigorous examination of the government's work and briefly explained the significance of the reorganization. It is to adapt to the new situation of implementing land reform, serving the peasants in the border region, and adapting to the victorious development of the patriotic self-defense war, to more effectively support the front lines. Therefore, it is necessary to rectify the government ranks, change the organization, and transform the work style. Among the government personnel, cadres from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds account for a large proportion. Their class viewpoints are not clear, and landlord and rich peasant ideology and bureaucratic work styles seriously exist. They have not been good "long-term workers" for the people of the border region. Secondly, the organizational structure of our government is not suitable for the New Democracy, but rather inherits the old ways of the Kuomintang government, which is neither suitable for the patriotic self-defense war nor for the needs of our work. Today, this old set of organizations must be reorganized, and certain personnel must be adjusted. However, today's reorganization is only the first step in streamlining the government organization. It is from top to bottom, not from bottom to top through the review of workers and peasants in the border region; therefore, it is preliminary, transitional, and temporary. Chairman Yang said that the methods and spirit of the reorganization are: (1) To strengthen financial and economic work, the Joint Military-Political Financial Office, which was necessary to establish in the past and has achieved results, will be merged with the Border Region Government to strengthen its power. Because the poor and lower-middle peasants have just turned themselves around after land reform, and there are still many difficulties that need to be greatly helped to solve, and their burdens cannot be increased. But we must also launch a major counter-offensive and fight major battles, which consumes a lot, which requires us to do a good job in financial and economic work. Overcome any departmentalism, corruption, and waste, and consider every bit for supporting the front lines and serving the masses. Therefore, this year, in addition to land reform, financial and economic construction, especially the development of production, is the central task of the government, which is the basic direction of combining land reform, serving the poor and hired, and consolidating the results of land reform. (2) The organizational structure must firmly grasp the principle of streamlining personnel, setting up positions according to tasks, not setting up positions according to people. Work should be divided into urgent and slow, and we will do whatever the masses need. Whatever organs are needed for work, we will set up those organs. The old organization that has been inherited from the Kuomintang government for a long time must be broken, and the bureaucratic work style that is high above and does not understand the suffering of the masses must be eradicated. Now, according to the economic development of our region and the urgent demands of the peasants, this government needs to re-establish the following institutions, namely seven departments of Finance, Cooperation, Industry, Trade, Transportation, Education, and Audit and Inspection, one Secretariat, the Public Security Bureau, and the Jinnan Bank. The directly affiliated agencies are the Border Region Postal Administration, the Health Bureau, the Trade Corporation, the Industrial Research Institute, and the Opium Suppression Bureau. (3) In the use of cadres, in addition to considering work needs and their work ability, in the past, more attention was paid to cultural level and work ability, and insufficient attention was paid to the training, promotion, and bold use of cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds, which is not right. In the future, we must pay attention to the composition and quality of cadres. Each department must not use personnel indiscriminately, and would rather have vacancies than disorder. Sometimes, for the sake of work, cadres should even be demoted to use, so that one person can do the work of one or even two people, improving work efficiency. In the past, there were too many levels in the government, and some departments had commanders but few soldiers, which was not good for leadership. This problem needs to be resolutely overcome.
    Regarding the leadership issue after the reorganization of the Border Region Government, Chairman Yang especially emphasized promoting the spirit of democracy and centralism. (1) The chairman and vice-chairmen should lead collectively, and appropriately divide the work on the basis of collective leadership, so as to overcome the past phenomenon of each taking care of their own affairs. The entire leadership should be exercised through the Political Affairs Conference. This conference should be composed of the chairman and vice-chairmen, the directors and deputy directors of the departments, the secretary-general and deputy secretary-general, the director and deputy director of the Public Security Bureau, and the general manager and deputy general manager of the bank; relevant departments may attend. Before the establishment of the Border Region Peasants' Representative Conference, this conference needs to respect and listen to the opinions of the preparatory committee of the Border Region Peasants' Representative Conference, and listen to the opinions of poor peasants, farm laborers, and workers, so as to improve the work. (2) Each department should establish a certain working conference system, and important issues must be discussed through meetings to promote the enthusiasm of each person. This meeting system must be adhered to and implemented, and must not be optional. (3) Establish a joint office (collective office) system, but it must not be reduced to formalism. Each person should work at least eight hours a day to break the lax phenomenon of "eating one's fill and doing nothing." Here, Chairman Yang called on all government personnel to continue the Three Check-Ups study, thoroughly overcome landlord and rich peasant ideology and bureaucracy, establish the idea of serving the poor and hired peasants and workers, and wholeheartedly and conscientiously be long-term workers for the people. Sitting and eating the people's millet is a criminal act.
    Finally, Chairman Yang announced the list of personnel after the reorganization of the Border Region Government and the powers of each department: Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Border Region Government, Zhang Youyu, and Rong Wusheng, Vice-Chairmen, are responsible for the overall leadership. Rong Wusheng, concurrently Vice-Chairman and Director of the Finance Department, is responsible for food, finance, taxation, war service, drafting budgets, and managing the treasury and public property. Yang Xiufeng, concurrently Chairman and Director of the Cooperation Department, is responsible for cooperative undertakings, water conservancy, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and mass sideline occupations. Xu Daben, Director of the Industry Department, and Lai Jifa, Deputy Director, are responsible for the military industry, the industrial and mining industries operated by the Border Region Government and various administrative offices, and the guidance and management of private industries. Lin Haiyun, Director of the Trade Department, is responsible for import and export management, import and export tax collection, monopoly of tobacco, alcohol, and salt and their taxes, and guidance and management of trade organs at all levels and private trade. Wu Jingtian, Director of the Transportation Department, and Zhang Wen'ang, Deputy Director, are responsible for railways, highways, roads, postal services, telecommunications, public transportation in the border region, and the guidance and management of people's transportation undertakings. Chao Zhefu, Director of the Education Department, is responsible for cultural education and childcare. Zhou Yucheng, Director of the Audit and Inspection Department, and Huang Songling, Deputy Director, are responsible for inspecting the revenue and expenditure of finance and banks, and the operations of various public enterprises; reviewing the annual budget and final accounts and all major extra-budgetary expenditures. When a certain use of funds is found to be inappropriate, they have the right to stop its use or suspend its work. Zhang Youyu, concurrently Vice-Chairman and Secretary-General, is responsible for documents, confidentiality, general affairs, retired soldiers and preferential treatment of soldiers, health, personnel transfers, investigation and research, and communication. Hu Jingsheng and Chen Xiyu, General Manager and Deputy General Manager of the Border Region Bank (Jinnan Bank), are responsible for managing issuance, loans, foreign exchange, banks at all levels, and their directly operated paper mills and printing plants. Bu Shengguang, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and Xu Qiwen, Deputy Director, are responsible for public security affairs. Bu Shengguang, concurrently Director of the Opium Suppression Bureau, and Yu Manyun, Deputy Director, are responsible for strictly prohibiting opium and drugs, and crushing the enemy's drug policy.

　　整顿政府队伍贯彻平分土地
  　边区政府正式改组
    【本报讯】边区政府于本月五日上午，正式改组。在改组会上，杨主席以自我批评精神，把政府工作做了严格的检查，并扼要说明改组意义，是为适合贯彻土地改革、服务边区农民与适应爱国自卫战争胜利开展的新形势，更有力的支援前线。因而必须整顿政府的队伍，改变组织，改造作风。在政府人员当中，地主、富农出身干部，占得比例数很大，阶级观点不明确，严重存在着地主、富农思想和官僚主义作风，没有做到当边区人民的好长工。其次，我们政府的组织机构，也不是适合于新民主主义的，而是因袭了国民党政府的老一套，既不适合于爱国自卫战争，也不适合于我们工作的需要。今天必需把这老一套组织改组，某些人员必须加以调整。不过今天的改组，只是整编政府组织的第一步，是自上而下的，还不是自下而上经过边区工人、农民群众审查过的；因此是初步的、过渡的和暂时的。改组的办法和精神，杨主席说：（一）为加强财经工作，把过去有必要设立并有成绩的军政联合财经办事处和边区政府合并起来，以加强力量。因为土地改革后，贫雇农群众刚刚翻过身，还有许多困难，需要大力帮助解决，更不能加重他们的负担。但我们还要大反攻，打大仗，消耗很大，这就要求我们把财经工作努力搞好。克服任何本位、贪污浪费现象，一点一滴都为支援前线与服务群众打算。因而今年除土地改革外，财经建设特别是发展生产工作是政府的中心工作，也即是结合土地改革，服务贫雇，巩固土地改革成果的基本方向。（二）组织机构要切实掌握精干原则，因事设人，不因人设事，工作要分别急缓，群众需要什么，我们就做什么。工作需要，设什么机关就设什么机关，长期因袭国民党政府的那套旧组织，必须打破，高高在上，不了解群众痛苦的官僚主义作风，必须铲除。现在根据我区经济情况的发展和农民的迫切要求，本府需要重新设立下列机构，即财政、合作、工业、贸易、交通、教育、审检七个厅，一个秘书处、公安总局、冀南银行。直属机关设有边区邮政总局，卫生局，贸易总公司，工业研究所、禁烟总局。（三）在干部使用上，除根据工作需要及其工作能力外，过去多注意文化水平，工作能力，而对工农出身干部的培养、提拔和大胆使用注意得太差，这是不对的。今后要讲究干部的成份和品质。各个部门，不能随便乱用人员，宁缺勿乱。有时为了工作，干部还要降级使用，做到一个人顶一个，甚至顶两个，提高工作效率。过去政府里等级太多，某些部门有司令而兵很少的现象，不好领导，这个毛病需要坚决克服。
    关于边府改组后的领导问题，杨主席特别强调发扬民主与集中的精神。（一）正副主席集体领导，在集体领导的基础上适当的分工，以克服过去的各顾各现象。整个领导，通过政务会议。这个会议，由正副主席、正副厅长、正副秘书长、公安总局正副局长、银行正副总经理组成；有关部门，可以列席参加。这个会议，在边区农民代表大会成立前，需要尊重与倾听边区农代会筹备委员会的意见，倾听贫农雇农工人的意见，以改进工作。（二）各部门要建立一定的工作会议制度，重要问题，必须经过会议讨论，发扬每个人的积极性。这种会议制度，要坚持贯彻，不得可有可无。（三）建立联合办公（集体办公）制度，但要不流于形式主义，每人每天最少做八小时工作，打破“饱食终日、无所用心”的松弛现象。在这里，杨主席号召所有政府人员，继续三查学习，彻底克服地主富农思想与官僚主义，树立为贫雇农民、工人服务思想，全心全意，兢兢业业为人民当长工。坐吃人民的小米，是一种犯罪行为。
    最后，杨主席宣布此次边府改组后的人员名单及各部门的职权：边府主席杨秀峰，副主席张友渔、戎伍胜，负责整个领导工作。财政厅厅长戎副主席兼，负责粮食、财政、税收、战勤，起草预算，掌管金库及公产管理。合作厅厅长杨主席兼，负责合作事业、水利、农林、畜牧、群众副业。工业厅厅长徐达本，副厅长赖际发，负责军工、边府和各行署经营的工矿业及民营工业的指导管理。贸易厅厅长林海云，负责出入口管理，出入口税收征收，烟酒、盐专卖及其税收，各级贸易机关及私人贸易指导管理。交通厅厅长武竞天，副厅长张文昂，负责铁路、公路、道路、邮政、电讯、边区公营运输事业、人民交通运输事业的指导管理。教育厅厅长晁哲甫，负责文化教育、儿童保育。审检厅厅长周玉成，副厅长黄松龄，负责检查财政、银行收支发行往来及各公营企业状况；审核全年预决算及一切预算外的较大项开支。发现某种用款开支不当时，并有权停止其使用或暂停其工作。秘书长张副主席兼，负责文书、机要、总务、荣退军人及优军、卫生、人事调动、调查研究、交际等工作。边区银行（冀南银行）正副总经理胡景生、陈希愈，负责管理发行、贷款、外汇，各级银行及其直接经营的纸厂、印刷厂。公安总局正副局长卜盛光、徐启文，负责公安事宜。禁烟总局局长卜盛光兼，副局长余漫云，负责厉行禁烟禁毒，粉碎敌人的毒化政策。
