　　The Landlord Hasn't Bowed His Head Yet
Comrade Editor:
    Recently in Majiu Village, Zuoquan, it was discovered that the landlords and old rich men have not yet bowed their heads. They are still secretly hiding their valuables. On the afternoon of January 6th, Comrade Bai Lantian, a correspondent of this unit, discovered a black package in a wall crack. The comrade immediately took it out and found that it contained silverware and other valuables. These things have now been handed over to the local masses. Based on the occurrence of this incident, we believe that the landlords and old rich men have not yet bowed their heads to the masses. The land reform is not yet thorough. We should still break the mentality of "almost there" and continue to struggle against the landlords until they are eliminated.

　　地主还没低头编辑同志：
    最近在左权马厩村，发现地主老财尚未低头，仍在暗暗的藏着内货，在一月六号的下午，本部通讯员白兰天同志，发现在一墙缝中有黑包一个，该同志立即拿出，原来是银器杂碎等内物。现在已将这些东西交给当地群众。根据这一事情的发生，我们认为地主老财还没有向群众低头，土改尚未彻底，仍应打破差不多的思想，将地主继续的斗争下去，直到消灭为止。
