　　Taihang Supplementary Fourth Regiment Sues for Grievances and Digs Up Roots
    Landlords Killed Parents and Wives; They Lifted Stone Slabs to Avenge their Enemies
    [Our News] The Taihang Supplementary Fourth Regiment, after "contributing ideas and resolving knots," with soldiers from poor peasant and hired laborer backgrounds as the backbone, launched a grievance-airing and root-digging movement starting on the 16th. Comrade Zhou Chengzhang of the Guard Company said: "I remember when my grandfather was alive, he had nothing to eat and starved to death. My father initially begged for food, and later became a long-term laborer for a wealthy man and was poisoned to death by the landlord. My fifth younger brother suffered outside. The landlord insisted on treating him like an adult, paying him wages according to a child's labor. He hated the landlord in his heart, developed sores, and died of anger. Seeing that life was unbearable, my mother starved and froze, ate little, and wore nothing. She hardened her heart and strangled two younger siblings to death, becoming a wet nurse for the landlord to make a living. Our family of five was starved to death, forced to death, and angered to death by the landlord." He burst into tears after finishing his story. Comrade Jia Heqing sadly recounted his grievances, saying: "My grandmother had a difficult life in the past. She had nothing to eat, nothing to wear, and no house to live in. She cooked for the rich man and worked as a servant. When she got old, the landlord kicked her out to beg for food, and she starved to death later. The hateful landlord refused to let her be buried in the grave. I took over the rich man's dilapidated house, but I didn't have the money to pay him, so I was kicked out again and lived in the temple. My father still begged for food, and my mother threw the baby, who was not even a month old, off the cliff to its death."
    The soldiers had wives forced away by landlords, were worked to death as long-term laborers, had fathers forced to death and not allowed to be buried, had to beg for food for three generations, had to repay nine shi for borrowing one shi, had landlords who let dogs eat dumplings but not the poor, were forced to flee famine and sell their children, and starved to death... There were too many painful things. In airing grievances in each class, everyone cried bitterly. Many comrades couldn't continue speaking when they reached the painful parts, and the comrades recording couldn't continue writing.
    After airing grievances, statistics showed that 768 parents, siblings, and children were forced to death, starved to death, frozen to death, angered to death, beaten to death, or poisoned to death by the landlord class. The families of the soldiers of the First Battalion had 214 people killed by the landlords, 60 people forced to be sold, and another 13 children forced to death. 401 houses were seized, 730 mu of land, 64 head of livestock, 62 sheep, 800 pieces of furniture, farm implements, and clothing, and 15,000 jin of grain. The families of the soldiers of the First Company had 20 people killed by the landlords, 23 starved to death, 44 forced to death, 18 missing, 10 child brides, and 13 children given away because they could not afford to raise them. 17 women from the families of the soldiers of the Thirteenth Company were raped by landlords.
    During the airing of grievances, everyone's class consciousness was raised. They clearly realized that the suffering was given by the landlord class, and that without overthrowing the landlords and the landlord's root, Chiang Kai-shek, they and their class brothers could not thoroughly turn over. Some people who had ideological barriers when joining the army also understood at this time. Li Youqing, the Ninth Squad Leader of the Third Company, said: "I begged for food for three generations and was driven out of the village by the landlord. My aunt was thrown into the river and drowned, and my uncle was angered to death. I cannot forget my family's history of suffering. I wanted to desert when I came, and I prepared a pass. I forgot my roots and was not worthy of being called a human being. From now on, I will study hard." Under the new understanding, all the soldiers enlightened and checked each other and contributed many passes. Everyone was determined to fight to the Yangtze River to liberate the poor brothers in the Chiang-controlled areas.
    On the 28th, each battalion held a memorial and revenge rally to mourn the 768 parents, siblings, and children who died in the disaster. All officers and soldiers wore a mourning flower on their chests. On the altar were the spiritual tablets of the victims. Everyone recalled the past suffering and shed tears. Wang Zhi of the Third Battalion said at the altar: "My family used to have no house or land. My parents and brothers were forced to death by the landlord. Now only I am left. I will resolutely avenge my parents. I have joined the army three or four times, but I have not been approved. This time, I must fight to Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and avenge my hatred. I have made a plan to ensure that I will complete it. First, I will learn the skills of killing the enemy militarily and politically. Second, I will not violate mass discipline and will serve the masses to the end, uncovering the stone slabs for the class brothers. Third, I guarantee that I will not desert, will not be captured, will exercise my body, and will not fall behind on the march. Fourth, I will obey the leadership, listen to commands, learn from each other, and complete the task. Fifth, I will kill ten enemies at the front." Comrade Kang Zhirong said simply: "My parents were forced to death by the puppet Baochang. This time, I volunteered to join the army to avenge my hatred. I will perform meritorious service for the people at the front, kill twenty enemies, capture twenty rifles and one machine gun, fight to Nanjing, and personally capture Chiang Kai-shek." The meeting ended in an atmosphere of "turning grief into strength and never returning home without capturing the bandit Chiang." (Jiang Tao, Wang Zhenchao, He Wanhua)
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    (In the army, airing grievances and digging up old roots makes the soldiers realize the pain of the landlord class and Chiang Kai-shek forcing their parents and wives to death, causing their families to be destroyed. They will inevitably demand revenge. In addition to guiding them to study hard and practice martial arts to "fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive," the leadership should also guide them to participate in the equal distribution of land, support the peasants, overthrow the landlords, and help the class brothers thoroughly turn over. -- Editor)

　　太行补充四团诉苦刨根
    地主害死父母妻子掀起石板大报冤仇
    【本报消息】太行补充四团经过“献思想，解疙瘩”，全团由贫雇出身的战士当骨干，从十六号起展开诉苦刨老根运动。警卫连周成章同志说：“我记得祖父活着的时候就没啥吃，活活饿死了。父亲起初要饭，后来给老财当长工，被地主毒死了。俺五弟在外受苦，地主硬要当大人使唤，按孩子的劳力开给工钱。他心中痛恨地主，长疮气死了。俺娘看见时光实在没法过，挨饿受冻，少吃没穿，狠了狠心把弟妹二人掐死，给地主当奶妈糊口。俺一家被地主饿死、逼死、气死五口。”说完泪流满面。贾和庆同志悲痛的诉苦说：“俺奶奶过去时光困难，没吃没穿，没房子住。给老财做饭当小使。年纪大了，被地主撵出来要饭，后来就饿死了。可恨地主硬不叫往坟里埋。俺当了老财的破房子，没钱给人家，又被撵出来，住到庙里。父亲还是要饭，母亲把没有满月的孩子从崖上扔下来跌死。”
    战士们被地主把老婆逼走的、当长工累死的、把父亲逼死不叫埋的、要三辈饭的、借一石还九石的、叫狗吃饺子不叫穷人吃的、被逼逃荒卖儿卖女的、饿死的………痛苦事情实在太多了。各班在诉苦中都是痛哭流涕，好多同志说到痛处说不下去，记录的同志也记不下去了。
    诉苦后统计：被地主阶级逼死、饿死、冻死、气死、打死、毒死的父母兄弟姊妹有七百六十八人。一营战士的家属被地主害死的二百一十四人，逼卖的六十人，另外逼死小孩十三人。抢走房子四百零一间，地七百三十亩，牲口六十四头，羊六十二只，桌椅、农具、衣服八百件，粮食一万五千斤。一连战士家属被地主杀死廿人，饿死廿三人，逼死四十四人，失踪十八人，童养媳十人，养不起把小孩送给别人十三人。十三连战士家属妇女被地主强奸十七人。
    诉苦中大家的阶级觉悟提高了。明确的认识了苦是地主阶级给的，不打倒地主和地主的老根蒋介石。自己和阶级弟兄不能彻底翻身。有些人参军时思想不通，这时也通了。三连九班长李有清说：“俺要了三辈子饭，被地主赶出村，把大娘扔在河里淹死，把大爷气死，我家的历史痛苦不能忘了。来时想开小差，准备了路条，我忘了本，不算人。从今以后要努力学习。”全体战士在新的认识下，互相启发检查献出了许多路条。大家都下决心打到长江边，解放蒋区穷弟兄。
    二十八日，各营召开追悼复仇大会。追悼被难的七百六十八位父母兄弟姊妹。全体指战员每人胸前带哀花一朵，灵台上有被难者的灵位，大家回忆起过去的痛苦，流出了眼泪。三营王志的在灵台上说：“我家过去房无一间，地无一垄，父母和兄弟被地主逼死，现在只剩下我一人，我要坚决为父母报仇。我已参军三四次了，没有验上。这次一定要打到南京，活捉蒋介石，报仇雪恨。我订出了计划，保证一定完成。一、军事政治上学习杀敌本领。二、不违犯群众纪律，为群众服务到底，为阶级弟兄揭石板。三、保证不开小差，不当俘虏，锻炼自己身体，行军保证不掉队。四、服从领导听指挥，互相学习完成任务。五、到前方要杀十个敌人。”康志荣同志干脆的说：“我父母都是被伪保长逼死的，这次自愿参军报仇，到前方为民立功，杀二十个敌人，缴二十支步枪，一挺机枪，打到南京去，亲自下手捉住蒋介石。”会议在“把悲痛变为力量，捉不住蒋贼决不回家”的情绪中结束。（江韬、王振朝、贺万华）
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    （在部队里诉苦刨老根，战士们认识了地主阶级和蒋介石逼死自己的父母妻子，使得自己家破人亡的痛苦，必然要求报仇，领导上除了应该引导他们好好学习练武“打到南京去，活捉蒋介石”以外，还应该引导他们参加平分土地，支援农民，打倒地主，帮助阶级弟兄彻底翻身。——编者）
