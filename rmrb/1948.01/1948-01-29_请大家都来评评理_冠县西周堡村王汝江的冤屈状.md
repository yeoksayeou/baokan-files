　　Please Everyone Judge Fairly
　　To the responsible comrade of the People's Daily:
　　Please publish my major grievance! I will talk about the exploitation I suffered at the hands of the evil landlord and the judicial section chief within the democratic government who shielded the landlord:

　　I. The landlord's exploitation of me:
　　In about 1930, Wang Yan (deceased) and Wang Xibai of this village asked my father to be their guarantor, borrowing 200 silver dollars from Feng Shuren (the landlord) at 3% monthly interest. After several years of interest payments, my father and Wang Yan had a falling out due to some issues and stopped communicating. Later, the creditor, Feng Shuren, urgently demanded repayment. At this point, the principal and interest totaled 220 dollars. Wang Yan and Wang Xibai privately entrusted Wang Ruming of the same village to mediate, giving Feng a plot of seven mu of land to repay the debt. This was not done through the guarantor. At the time, Feng said the land was worth 20 dollars per mu, while Wang Yan and Wang Xibai said it should be calculated at 30 dollars per mu. Feng said there was still a shortfall of 80 dollars and forced my father to cover it. My family was unable to pay, so he pressured my father to hand over four mu of our land as security. Feng said at the time, "If that seven mu sells for enough to cover the 220 dollars, I won't make your father pay." Later, Feng also calculated Wang Yan and Wang Xibai's land back to the owners, at 40 dollars per mu, totaling 280 dollars for the seven mu, which was handed over to Feng Shuren through Wang Ruming. However, Feng turned around and demanded the four mu of land that my father had guaranteed. My father refused. In the spring, my sorghum had grown over a foot tall, and Feng sent people to plow it over with a ridging plow. The villagers intervened, preventing them from plowing it all. When the sorghum ripened, Feng led a group of people with guns, both long and short, to harvest my family's sorghum. We firmly refused. Feng cursed us and said, "If I can't take you down, I'll change my surname!" They immediately hitched up a mule-drawn carriage and forced my father to go to Guan County to file a lawsuit. My father had no choice but to go with them to Guan County. I was only fourteen years old then; I'm thirty-two now. At that time, Feng had the final say in the old government; he had money and influence. The government immediately issued a summons and used administrative pressure to force my father to admit wrongdoing. The officials all told my father to endure it, saying that he couldn't win against Feng, even with ten people like him. My father had no choice but to swallow his anger. After mediation, he was told to compensate Feng 100 silver dollars and pay for two tables of guests, costing another 20 silver dollars. They wouldn't let us leave the city gate that day until we paid in cash. We were poor people; how could we have so much cash? We had to ask Wang Yushan and Wang Guangxin of the same village to be our guarantors, borrowing 100 silver dollars from Du Tingju of Du Zhaozhuang in the Third District of the county at 3% monthly interest, which was immediately given to Feng to settle the matter. After using Du Tingju's 100 dollars and paying interest for several years, we sold eighteen mu of our own land to repay this unjust debt. After the Eighth Route Army arrived in 1938, various salvation organizations were formed. At that time, I was making oil for a living and joined the Youth Salvation Association, serving as the director of the village Youth Salvation Association, often going to the district government committee meetings. The superiors repeatedly said that anyone with grievances should bring them up. At this time, I approached Feng Shuren once and said, "Mr. Feng! Today we're going to settle old scores." Because I was Feng's nephew, Feng Shuren said, "Nephew, why would we settle accounts? If you have nothing to eat or drink, I have plenty. Just say the word, and I'll send someone to farm and deliver it to you." I said, "Don't just talk nicely. We must see this through." Feng immediately hired some "busy bodies," who, carrying box cannons and riding horses, went to my house and threatened us. Under those circumstances, I didn't dare to say anything definitive. I said, "Since you're all here, I've told you my grievances. You can decide what to do!" After Wang Qinghe and seven or eight others of the same village mediated, they gave me 50 yuan in legal tender, and that was the end of it. But I always felt that the injustice in my heart hadn't been vented. At this time, in December 1939, I joined the revolutionary work. During the mass movement in 1945, I again sued Feng Shuren, going to all levels of government, but the case was never resolved fairly after two years. Therefore, I am reporting the facts to your newspaper, hoping that you will help to clarify the truth and redress the people's grievances.

　　II. The handling of the case by various levels of government:

　　I initially sued at the Xin County X District Office, where Fan Shangchen was the judicial assistant. The first time I went to the district office, I presented my written complaint and explained it in person. I asked him to summon the defendant, but he said he was too busy and told me to come back in a few days. The second time I went, bringing witnesses, I asked Assistant Fan to summon the defendant for cross-examination, but he still didn't summon the defendant. Fan Shangchen said, "Feng Shuren is a landlord; it's so hot, he won't come even if I summon him. I'll talk to the village cadres of his village first and ask about it. You can go back now." In the district office, he never confronted Feng Shuren directly. Seeing that the problem couldn't be solved, I appealed to the Xin County Democratic Government, where Niu Xiangfu (a landlord who was being struggled against) was the judicial section chief. He and Feng Shuren were old acquaintances. During the trial, he sided with the landlord Feng Shuren instead of the poor and hired peasants, eating and drinking at the landlord's house. During the court session, because I was working for the Guan County government, I didn't appear in court; my father went to Jiaozhuang for the hearing with the witnesses Wang Ruming and Wang Xibai. But Section Chief Niu had two different attitudes when questioning them: he had a forceful and oppressive attitude when questioning my father and the witnesses, but a welcoming and natural attitude with a smile when questioning the landlord Feng Shuren. He even secretly asked the witnesses, "How much money did the plaintiff Wang Rujiang promise you?" And he threatened the witnesses, "You must tell the truth, or I will severely punish you." After the court session, the witnesses went home and cried bitterly, saying, "They still talk about democracy now, but is this how it is? The words of the poor are still like farts!" When they returned, my father was so angry that he fell ill for several days, coughing and barely alive (he was in his sixties or seventies). After a long time, a judgment was finally issued, stating: "The debt covering is not proved, not convenient to investigate." We had both witnesses and material evidence. At that time, I asked the government to detain Feng Shuren, saying that if it was found that I was falsely accusing him, I would take the blame. But the government didn't listen, and Feng Shuren and his son have now defected to the enemy (in Jinan). I felt very distressed, so I appealed to the Special Commissioner's Office, but when the case was tried, the judicial staff member Li Yanling sided with the landlord Feng Shuren and not with the poor and hired peasants. Fortunately, the judicial section chief, Comrade Song Shaoliang, had a firm proletarian stance. Later, he issued a judgment to me, which stated: "Wang Rujiang's debt has been proven true from all sides, and the county judgment is overturned, and Feng Shuren should compensate Wang Rujiang 3,000 yuan." I felt that the current trial of cases should side with the poor and hired peasants. In the past, the dark governments all sided with the landlords; now it should be changed to side with the poor, and the landlords should be made to run a little. At this time, the judgment proved the facts, and no matter how much the judgment was for, politically, it was considered a victory, so let it go! But according to rumors, the village cadres said to Feng Shuren, "Appeal to the Administrative Office!" and said, "Our village's wealth cannot be taken by outsiders." Because I am from Xizhou Village, Third District, Guan County, which is not the same county or village, Feng Shuren appealed to the Administrative Office. But when the Administrative Office summoned the case, the landlord Feng and the village cadres of his village arrived, but I did not. My father was too old and unable to travel easily, so he did not appear in court either. Because I was at my work post, at that time, my understanding was that I couldn't abandon my entire job to handle my own affairs, so I wrote a letter to the Judicial Office of the Administrative Office. I felt that our Administrative Office couldn't handle it sloppily. Who would have thought that the Administrative Office would have made a sloppy judgment? When I received the judgment and read it, my heart was inflamed. The judgment stated that "the Special Commissioner's Office judgment has no basis and should be overturned, and that the covering debt is not true. Even if it were true, it was in 1938, it has been resolved once, and should not be pursued again." I immediately went to the Administrative Office again (still on work business), but a certain Cao of the Judicial Office scolded me. Cao said, "Why didn't you come on time when the case was summoned?" I said that because I was busy with work, if I didn't come, shouldn't you investigate clearly before handling it? He said, "This is how I handle it. Do as you please. There's also Director Meng and the Border Region Government. You can find whoever you want; do as you see fit!" I wanted to go to the Border Region Government, but because my work couldn't be left, and my father was too old to take the witnesses, and there were no travel expenses, I had no choice but to swallow my anger and endure it! I kept this anger in my stomach until today, and I feel that there are people who can make the decision for me.

　　The purpose of my reporting these grievances is: First, to raise the class consciousness of the poor and hired peasants. Second, to rectify the organization and eliminate the destructive elements of landlord ideology. Third, to clarify the truth of my major grievances.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Respectfully submitted by,
　　　Wang Rujiang

　　请大家都来评评理
  　冠县西周堡村王汝江的冤屈状人民报社负责同志：
    请你们与我登一下冤枉大事吧！我谈谈万恶地主对我的剥削及民主政府里边的司法科长包庇地主的行为：
    一、地主剥削我的情形：
    本村王阎氏（已死）、王西白远在民国十九年间，央我父作保，以三分生息，揭贷冯树仁（地主）银币二百元。生息几年后，我父与使钱户王阎氏因事弄怨，不通语言，后来债权人冯树仁迫切叫归还帐目，这时连本代（带）利共欠冯二百廿元。使钱户王阎氏、王西白亲另托本村王汝明说合，交给冯某地七亩，以归还所欠之帐目，并未经担帐人的手。当时冯说地算每亩二十元，使钱户说按每亩三十元计算，冯言说还短八十元，强迫我父垫帐，我家无力垫付，当压迫我父将业地批给冯四亩作为铺保。当时冯言说：如果那七亩卖够二百廿元了，就不让我父垫帐。后来冯又将王阎氏、王西白之地又算给本主，每亩以四十元计算，七亩共折二百八十元，经王汝明之手，交给冯树仁，但冯却又反来还要我家作保的四亩业地。我父不允，到了春天我种的高粱已出来长有一尺多高，冯派人将我的高粱苗用耩地耧＠去，经本村群众管说，没有＠完。等高粱熟时，冯领着人马并代（带）长短钢枪，割我家的高粱，我们坚决不允，冯大骂一顿，并说：“我要正（整）不下你去，将冯字就改了。”他们回去马上套了骡马轿车，叫我父坐着他们车尾巴去冠县城里打官司。我父被迫无耐（奈），就跟着他们进了冠县城。那时我才十四岁，我今年三十二岁了。那时冯在旧政府里说一不二，有钱又有势力，当天政府就出票过堂，以行政压力，迫我父认错。管事人都说我父你忍耐了吧，你与他打官司，十个你也不行，我父无耐（奈），只好任（忍）气吞声，经管事人调说，垫偿给冯银币一百元，又叫我父承席请客，用了两席，又用银币二十元。当天不叫我们出城门，即要现洋。我们是个贫苦人，那有怎些现洋呢？无奈又托人，有本村王玉山、王广心二人作保，三分行息，揭到本县三区杜赵庄杜廷举银币百元，即交冯即算完事。使的杜廷举此百元，行息数年，我们地又少，年年打的粮食不够吃，那有余利钱上呢？后来连本代（带）利，将自己业地十八亩便（变）卖出，才归还了这笔冤枉大帐。待至民国二十七年，咱八路军来到后，各地组织救亡团体，那时我在家打油为生，便参加了青救会担任村青救会主任，常到区政委会去开会。上级屡次讲，谁有冤枉都提出来，在这时我就找了冯树仁一次，我说：“冯先生！今天咱要算旧帐了。”因我是他冯家外甥，冯树仁声称：“外甥咱还算的什么帐啦，你无吃的，无喝的，咱都有，只要说句话，我派种地的与你送去。”我说：“你别光好嘴了，这一会咱们一定要干到底。”冯马上托了些“大管闲事”，都代（带）着盒子枪骑着大马找到我家去了，都说些三七、二八话，将我们威胁了一顿，在那个时局之下，我也没干（敢）说坚决怎样，我说：“你们大家都来啦，我的冤曲（屈）说给你们了，你们看着办吧！”经本村王清合等七、八个人调说，给了我法币票伍拾元，即算了事。我肚里的冤曲（屈）总觉没倒出来。在这时即民国二十八年十二月间，我即参加了革命工作。待至民国三十四年群运时，我又诉讼了冯树仁，走遍了各级政府，官司打了二年，终久未得到合理解决，为此又向贵社诉明事实，万望你们将此问题代为分清皂白，以解民冤。
    二、各级政府处理经过情形：
    初次诉讼到莘县×区区公所，适赶范商臣担任司法助理。第一次我到该区区公所，我并手持呈文又面诉了一遍，我要求他传案，他即说没有空，等几天你再来吧！我二次去，并代（带）领证人，我又叫范助理传案对词，他又不传被告。范商臣口称：“冯树仁是个地主，天气怎热，传他也不来。我给他村村干谈谈吧，先问问，你们就回去好了。”在区里终久没给冯树仁对了头。我看着不能解决问题，我即上诉到莘县民主政府，适赶牛相甫（被斗户）担任司法科长，他与冯树仁是个老交情。在就审时，他不凑贫雇咱们这头，他便凑地主冯树仁那头，在地主家吃喝。过堂时，因我在冠县政府工作，我未到案，我父前往听审，同证人王汝明王西白以（一）并前往焦庄过堂。但牛科长讯问时两样态度：问我父和证人时是一种强迫态度，代（带）有压制性的，问地主冯树仁时是一种影（迎）面代（带）笑的态度，是自然性。并且背地问证人：“原告王汝江许给你多少钱呢？”并威胁证人：你们要说实话，不然我一定重办你们。等过完堂，证人回到家后大哭一场，证人便说：“现在还说实行民主，这样还是有的说么是么啦！穷人说话还是算放庇（屁）”等话。等回去后，我父气的病了数日，正（整）天哼咳，气死气活的（六七十岁了）。等了很久，才发来判决书一份，此书主文所注：“垫帐不实，不便追究。”我们又有人证还有物证，在当时我要求政府将冯树仁扣押起来，我并说如果调查出我是诬告他，由我来顶罪，但政府不听不理，结果冯树仁父子两个，现已投敌（济南）。我觉得心里非常苦脑（恼），我又上诉专署，但专署就审时，司法科员李彦令又是凑地主冯树仁家，没在贫雇咱们这里。判决时幸有司法科长宋绍良同志有坚定的无产阶级立场，后来发给我判决书一份，此判决并注明：“王汝江势帐从各方证明确实，县判予以驳斥，并由冯树仁赔偿王汝江三千元”。我觉得现就审案件应当凑贫雇，在过去黑暗政府都是凑地主，现在就应改变一下凑穷人，叫地主跑两步腿也应该了。在这时已判决证明事实，无论判款多少，在政治上算占了上风，即算了事吧！但据传言说：他村村干部说：“冯树仁你上诉行署给打吧”，并说“咱村里的财百（帛）不能让外村侵占。”因我是冠县三区西周人，又不一县又不一村，故此冯树仁便上诉行署。但行署传案，地主冯和他村村干部到了，我又无到，我父年纪太大，行走不便，也未到案。因我在工作岗位上，当时我的认识不能将正（整）个工作丢下去办自己的事去，故此向行署司法处写信寄去，我觉得咱行署不能马马湖湖（糊糊）的处理。谁料相（想）行署“兮连湖度”下了金殿呢？就判决了，我接到判决书以（一）看，心火就上升了。此判决注明“专署判决毛（毫）无根据，应予以驳倒，并说垫帐不实，即便真是垫帐，前在民国二十七年了，过一次事了，不应再追究。”我即又找到行署（还是因工作去的），但司法处曹某人将我撞了一顿，曹某人并说：“在传案时你为什么不按时来呢？”我说因工作忙我不来你就不考查清就处理吗？他说：“我就这样的处理法，随你的便，也有孟主任，也有边区政府，你愿意找谁就找谁，你看着办吧！”我有心到边区政府，奈因工作不能脱离，我父岁数太大，代（带）着证人去又无盘费，只好任（忍）气吞声，自己劝自己任（忍）耐了吧！将这一口气又闷在肚里了，以致（一直）放到今天，我觉得才有给作主的人了。
    我诉出这些冤枉的目的，第一、为了提高贫雇农民的阶级觉悟性。第二、为了整理组织产（铲）除地主思想的破坏分子。第三、为了将我的冤枉大事分清皂白。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　具字人
