　　According to reports from this newspaper: Licheng examined the reasons why winter production was not successful. According to a survey by the county office, in most cases it was because landlord and rich peasant cadres and landlord and rich peasant elements controlled the major power in the villages. In Jinjia Street, the one who held power was Yu Wenhusen, a feudal rich peasant who had been the village head for three generations, father and son, for more than ten years, and many of the main cadres were his loyal informants. Zhang Enkui and Zhang Junming, the main targets of struggle in the village, served as the chairman and accountant of the cooperative, respectively. Zhang Shenhai, a poor peasant and hired laborer, was the director of the Armed Forces Committee, but those landlord and rich peasant cadres insisted that he had "special agent activities," suppressed him, and replaced him with the lackey Wang Songjiang. Sun Laohu, the political director of Xiwu, was a bankrupt landlord. These people opened their mouths to the higher authorities and said, "The masses" are like this and like that, and used the hat of "special agent activities" to suppress the peasants. They used these two methods to maintain their position.

　　　　Using various methods to attack poor and hired peasants
They were most afraid of the poor and hired peasants rising up, and used various ruthless methods to attack them. When Jinjia Street carried out land reform, they said, "The scope of struggle should not be too wide," and pushed the village head's two uncles from the first category of struggle targets to the third category. The poor and hired peasants were so angry that they said, "If there are no targets of struggle, what are we fighting for?" They tried to lead the land reform to counter-espionage, and used various bad methods to bite out many "special agents" among the peasants, and even beat some people to death. However, the real special agent, Wang Shuqin, was given a pass by them and let go. Zhang Jianü, Zhang Jiduan, Zhang Wentian, and Zhang Xiandan were the backbone of the poor peasant and hired laborer groups. They labeled these poor and hired peasants as "special agents," beat Zhang Jianü three times, put her under control, and sent her to the flour mill to carry water; beat Zhang Wentian half to death; squeezed Zhang Xiandan out; isolated Zhang Jiduan; and ruined this poor peasant and hired laborer group. Subsequently, they organized a "poor peasant group" led by hooligans, each averaging eight mu of land. Ten peasant families in Kengxi were allocated a mule, which was taken away by the cooperative for no reason. When the mule owners went to carry the trough, they were labeled as "special agents" and beaten half to death.

　　　　Cooperatives have become "air-raid shelters" for landlords and rich peasants
Many cooperatives have become "air-raid shelters" for landlords and rich peasants. In the Jinjia Street cooperative, out of eleven people, there were three landlords, four feudal rich peasants, and four old middle peasants. The 100,000 yuan loan was put into the cooperative by them, earning dividends for their consumption. More than 1.9 million yuan was consumed in a year, and they also embezzled ten big shis of Yicang wheat into the cooperative. The masses reflected, "After being struggled at home, they become ancestors in the cooperative!" They suppressed the funds of millions of peasants, and the peasants had no capital for production. Dong Yizheng, a special agent landlord in Beishe, organized a small textile factory and asked the masses to pool shares to buy an iron machine, but it was used exclusively by five landlord women. The Xiwu cooperative also supported several landlords, who, in addition to earning wages, also asked the peasants to cultivate 15 to 17 mu of land for them. In Beishe, there were more than a dozen production security groups, and the heads of nine of the groups were landlords and rich peasants. Under the pretext of production, they controlled the peasants so that they could not move.

　　　　Surrounding county and district cadres to conceal their crimes
These bad guys oppressed and bullied the peasants, and surrounded, deceived, and bought off the cadres from the county and district. In Xiwu, when dispatching meals and finding houses for the district cadres, they always chose places with many landlords and rich peasants. They lent wheat, oil, firewood, and water to the district cadres living in the village, settled their families, and sold fruits and fur coats to them at low prices. As soon as Comrade Li Lanting arrived at Jinjia Street to work, the village cadres provided a pile of "special agent" materials (actually materials on peasant activities). After Comrade Li Lanting himself reviewed, he moved from the political director's home to the director of the Armed Forces Committee's home to find poor and hired peasants. The political director moved the quilt over again, lit a big fire, laid white felt, and put up large and small tables and chairs in Comrade Li's residence. Later, four more cadres came to this village, and the meals at noon were all white flour, and there was even noodle soup at night. The next noon, it was all dumplings. Young women served the meals, poured water, and lit the fire. At night, the village cadres sent four or five quilts, as well as two boxes of children's cigarettes. Several cadres came in and out here alternately. If there was a meal and the district cadres were not seen, the village cadres would go to the whole village to find them. When asked about the situation of winter production, the village cadres said, "Winter production has been organized and started!" After the inspection, only thirteen or fourteen households in the village were working. Poor and hired peasants wanted to produce but had no funds. The village head sold four fruit carts, one for 7,500 yuan, all to middle peasants and above. They did not lend the money to the poor and hired peasants, but said to the district cadres, "The funding for the poor and hired peasants has been resolved!" Xiwu's base point convened a poor peasant meeting through the village cadres. Some lackeys and informants from various villages came to monitor the poor and hired peasants. This meeting did not get any substantive materials.
The poor and hired peasants are very dissatisfied with these things. Yuan Zhong'an, a poor and hired peasant in Xiwu, led the masses to block the accounts of embezzled fruits and demanded an immediate solution. The district cadres were afraid of hurting the "emotions" of the village cadres, and used the method of shielding and delaying. Comrade Li Lanting only found poor and hired peasants to investigate materials, but did not solve the problem, which angered the poor and hired peasants, who said, "If it is not resolved, we will hand over the accounts to the county and quit!" The poor and hired peasants demanded to seize the cooperatives controlled by the landlords and rich peasants and use them to organize their own production.

### 黎城五村调查发现大毛病　地主富农压迫贫雇弄得冬季生产塌台

　　黎城五村调查发现大毛病
  　地主富农压迫贫雇弄得冬季生产塌台
    【本报消息】黎城检查冬季生产没有搞好的原因，据县办公室调查，大都是因为地主富农干部和地主富农分子掌握了村里大权。靳家街顶专权的是十几年来父子三代当村长的封建富农宇文虎森，不少主要干部又是他的忠实耳目。村里主要斗争对象张恩奎、张俊明担任着合作社的社长和会计。贫雇农张申海是武委会主任，那些地主富农干部硬说他有“特务活动”，把他打击下去，换上狗腿王松江。西仵政治主任孙老虎是个破产地主。这些人对上边张口就说：“群众”如何如何，对农民拿“特务活动”的帽子压制。用这两套手腕，维持他们的地位。
    　　　　用各种方法打击贫雇农
    他们顶害怕贫雇农起来，用种种凶狠的方法打击贫雇农。靳家街进行土地改革时，他们说：“斗争面不能宽”，把村长的两个叔叔从头类斗争对象推到三类上。气得贫雇农说：“这倒没有斗争对象啦，还斗个蛋？”他们想法把土地改革引到反特务上，用各种坏法子，在农民中咬出好多“特务”，还打死了一些人。真正的特务王书芹倒叫他们开路条放走了。张嘉女、张记端、张文田、张县旦是贫雇小组的骨干，他们给这些贫雇农带了个“特务”帽，把张嘉女打了三顿，管理起来，送到粉坊里担水；把张文田打了个半死；把张县旦挤出去；把张记端孤立起来；把这个贫雇小组弄垮了。随后他们就组织了一个由流氓当头子、每人平均到八亩地的“贫雇组”。坑西十一家农民分到一头骡子，无缘无故被合作社拉走了。骡户去抬槽，他们扣上个“特务”帽，把骡户打了个半死。
    　　　　合作社成了地主富农的“防空洞”
    好多合作社成了地主富农的“防空洞”。靳家街合作社中十一个人，有三个地主、四个封建富农、四个旧中农。十万元贷款都被他们放到合作社中，赚上红利给他们消耗，一年消耗了一百九十多万元，还贪污了十大石义仓麦到合作社中。群众反映：“斗了家里，人家到了合作社成了老祖宗啦！”他们压着几百万农民的资金，农民想生产没有本钱。北社特务地主董义正组织了一个小型纺织厂，叫群众集股买了一架铁机，却让五个地主妇女专用起来。西仵合作社也养活了几个地主，这些家伙除了赚工钱，还叫农民给他们代耕十五亩到十七亩地。北社有十几个生产治安组，有九个组的组长是地主富农，他们借口生产，把农民管得不能动。
    　　　　包围县区干部，掩蔽自己的罪恶
    这些坏家伙压迫、欺侮农民，对县上、区上来的干部是包围、欺骗和收买。西仵给区干部派饭找房子，总是在地主富农多的地方。他们给住村的区干部借麦子、借油、弄柴、弄水、安置家属、贱卖给果实皮袄。李兰廷同志才到靳家街工作，村干部就供给了一堆“特务”材料（实际是农民活动材料）。李兰廷同志自己经过检讨，从政治主任家搬到武委会主任家去找贫雇，政治主任又搬上被子找了来，在李同志住的地方生上大火、铺上白毡、摆上大小桌椅。后来又有四个干部来到这村，晌午派饭都是白面，黑夜还作了面汤，第二天晌午全是饺子，端饭、倒水、点火全由青年妇女伺候。黑夜村干部给送来四、五条被子，还有两盒小孩烟。几个干部在这里交替进出，要有一顿饭的时候看不见区干部，村干部就到全村去找。问到冬季生产的情形，村干部说：“冬季生产都组织起来干开啦！”以后检查，村里只有十三、四户在动，贫雇农想生产没有资金，村长卖了四辆果实大车，一辆七千五百元，都卖给中农以上成份。钱也不借给贫雇农，却对区干部说：“贫雇资金解决啦！”西仵基点通过村干部召开了一个贫雇会，各村都来了一些狗腿、耳目监视贫雇农，这个会没有得到什么实在的材料。
    贫雇农对这些事情是很不满意的。西仵贫雇原忠安领导群众卡住贪污果实帐，要求立时解决。区干部怕打击了村干部的“情绪”，用了包庇拖延的办法。李兰廷同志光找贫雇调查材料，不解决问题，气的贫雇说：“再不解决我们把帐交到县上不干啦！”贫雇农要求夺取被地主富农掌握的合作社，拿来组织自己的生产。
