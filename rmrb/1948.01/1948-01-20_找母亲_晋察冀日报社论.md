　　“Finding the Mother”
　　Jin-Cha-Ji Daily Editorial
　　[Xinhua News Agency Jin-Cha-Ji Dispatch] The Jin-Cha-Ji Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Finding the Mother," pointing out that the North Yue District Party Committee's invitation to non-Party employed poor peasants to participate in land reform meetings had a significant impact on the equal distribution of land and the rectification of the ranks. The editorial first sharply criticized the erroneous view held by some that "employed poor peasants are neither Party members nor cadres, how can they participate in Party meetings?" Then it pointed out: "These people want to make our Party leave the ground, trick us into mid-air, and strangle us. We should not fall for their trap." The article then listed the sixth point of the conclusion of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and the comrades Lenin and Stalin's discussions on the connection between the Party and the masses, advising everyone, and stating: "Our Party is not a sect, but a revolutionary team representing the proletariat and acting as a vanguard for the people; therefore, we must find the mother, listen to the mother, and regard the good opinions of the masses as valuable instructions." The editorial continued: "In the land reform meetings held in various places, more employed poor peasants and active members of the masses should be invited to participate. However, when employed poor peasants first arrive at Party meetings, they often dare not speak boldly, and the leadership should encourage them to speak and support them. At the Fuping meeting, because the employed poor peasants spoke boldly and criticized the bad cadres, the good and the bad were distinguished at the meeting, righteousness rose, and evil declined. Many cadres also saw their own shortcomings and mistakes clearly and repented. Those who had encroached on the fruits also withdrew them voluntarily. This was mainly because they found the mother and understood in their hearts." The editorial concluded, "The participation of employed poor peasants and active members of the masses in Party meetings is of great help to Party members and cadres. In addition, their participation in discussing our Party's policies and plans makes them understand even more in their hearts. When they return to the village, they will be more active, more progressive, more improved, and more capable. They will have more ways to lead the struggle. This is the children finding the mother, the mother educating the children, and the children also educating the mother; it is also our Party connecting with the masses, the masses teaching us, and we also teaching the masses. In this way, cadres will be trained, the struggle will be correctly led, and fewer mistakes will be made."

　　“找母亲”
  　晋察冀日报社论
    【新华社晋察冀电】晋察冀日报日前发表题为“找母亲”社论，指出北岳区党委邀请党外雇贫农群众参加土地改革会议，对于平分土地与整顿队伍作用很大。社论首先尖锐批评了某些人关于“雇贫农既不是党员又不是干部，怎么能参加党的会议”的错误说法后，指出：“这些人想使我们党离开地面，把我们骗到半空中，捏死我们，我们不应上他们的当。”该文继列举联共党史结束语第六条及列宁斯大林同志论党和群众的联系，告诫大家，并称：“我们的党不是一个宗派，而是代表无产阶级，代表人民打先锋的革命队伍；因此要找母亲，听母亲的话，将群众好的意见当做宝贵的指示。”社论继称：“各地所召开的土地改革会议，应多请一些雇贫农积极群众参加。但雇贫农初到党的会议上，往往不敢大胆发言，领导上即应鼓励他们讲话，给他们撑腰。阜平会议由于雇贫农大胆讲话，批评了坏干部，因此在会上使好坏分清，正气上升，邪气下降，许多干部对自己的缺点、错误亦看得清楚了，反省了。侵占果实的亦自动退出。这主要是找到了母亲，心里明白了。”社论最后称“雇贫农积极群众参加党的会议，对党员和干部帮助很大，另外他们参加讨论我们党的政策、计划，使他们心里更明白了。回到村里就更积极、更进步、更提高、更能干了，就更有办法领导斗争，这就是儿女找母亲，母亲教育儿女，儿女亦教育母亲；亦就是我们的党联系群众，群众给我们上课，我们亦给群众上课，这样就培养了干部，就能正确的领导斗争，就会少犯错误。”
