Stop Cadres from Monopolizing and Distributing the Fruits of Victory Arbitrarily
Act According to the Land Law, Otherwise it is Illegal

[This Newspaper's News] In some areas of Taihang, the fruits of victory are being investigated and distributed to hired and poor peasants to boost winter production. Why have these fruits not been distributed for so long? Is the current distribution truly for the benefit of hired and poor peasants? Is the distribution completely fair and in line with the spirit of the Land Law? Has the class line of mobilizing hired and poor peasants truly been followed? These questions are not explained in the correspondent's submission. This distribution of fruits is being carried out through a top-down cadre line. In many places, landlords and rich peasants are still manipulating the major power in the villages. The rich peasant line and the style of suppressing the masses among the cadres have not been resolved, and the hired and poor peasants have not yet been emancipated. Under these circumstances, a very hasty distribution will certainly not truly satisfy the demands of the hired and poor peasants, and it will not be able to comply with the spirit of the Outline Land Law of China. From the perspective of the long-term interests of hired and poor peasants, rural workers, and all peasants with little or no land, this approach is not good. The following are various materials provided for everyone to study.

Lucheng's Fifth District held a village cadre meeting on the 27th of last month to inspect winter production and found that many hired and poor peasants were unable to participate in production. "Li Yuzhe was a hired peasant, and he was not thoroughly emancipated during the movement. The village cadres mobilized him to repair the road, but he did not go. The cadres all said he was lazy and had a hedonistic mentality. Later, after the cadres talked to him individually, they discovered that the reason he was unwilling to go out to work was because he had no quilt to cover himself with." Afterwards, the cadres began to examine themselves. Gao Renbao, the village chief of Gaozhuang Village, said: "I have been emancipated, bought a big mule, and only care about my own production, forgetting the poor." "Everyone unanimously agreed that they should not blame the hired and poor peasants for not participating in production, but that the cadres themselves had not gone deep enough to solve their difficulties." Everyone proposed distributing the remaining fruits of struggle. According to the district's statistics, there are currently 10,860,500 yuan of fruits of victory, which will be completely distributed to the hired and poor masses as production funds. In addition, 8,692,000 yuan of fruits of victory previously placed in the cooperative will be distributed to the hired and poor masses as production funds.

	It is the Cadres Who Solve the Difficulties of Hired and Poor Peasants

The shares of the Nanzhuang Cooperative in Changzhi's Second District are mostly fruits of struggle. Various physical objects are estimated to be worth 1,763,000 yuan at current market prices. A total of 283,000 yuan was invested by the whole village, including 44 households of hired and poor peasants, 64 households of middle peasants, 21 households of rich middle peasants, 6 households of rich peasants, and 23 households of struggle targets. The hired and poor peasants suffered a great loss due to profit sharing according to shares. There are two accountants, one is Jin Shuanghao, a member of the "Three People's Principles Youth League," and the other is Wang Zhaohai, who has "three guarantees." Wang Zhaohai has been an accountant in the village for more than 20 years, not working, and has been in power in the village. They messed up the cooperative completely. The total gross profit was 399,900 yuan, and their food expenses alone were 399,900 yuan. On the 23rd, a meeting of 75 hired and poor peasant households was held, and it was decided to distribute all the fruits of the cooperative to the hired and poor peasants and the families of revolutionary martyrs who had no labor force. Everyone said: "This is great, the government is really seeking benefits for us!"

	The Government Convened a Meeting of Hired and Poor Peasants and Distributed the Fruits All at Once

A meeting of hired and poor peasants was held in Zhengzhao Village, Shahe. "Everyone clearly realized that they had suffered a great loss in the past because they had no power." It was decided to "take out the things from the farmers' association and use them as capital for us." Zhang Ju said: "There are trees and wood in the farmers' association. Let's form a small wood factory, so we can have work and firewood. We must also discuss together how to use the money, and how much each person should use. We guarantee that we will not waste it or eat what we buy with the money. The fruits of the farmers' association and the village finances should be sorted out quickly, and as much as is sorted out should be taken out first and handed over to us for production." "The next day, the village cadres started to sort things out..." After a whole day, the farmers' association had sorted out the following: trees worth 500,000 yuan, 300,000 yuan used by the militia grocery store, three cypress coffins, 200 kilograms of tin, 100 kilograms of cotton seeds, three bags of black beans, two gold rings, and one gold hairpin. In addition, the masses also borrowed 100,000 yuan in cash. Other items need to be quickly converted into cash. The village cadres examined themselves and said: "We didn't see these people in the past, it's our fault for being shortsighted."

	The Village Chief Breaks Through the Thinking of the Poor and Hired Peasants Before Distributing the Fruits Again

Village cadres in Gaoyi's Second District held a meeting to inspect winter production. Talking about future practices, the village chief of Qianzhuangtou Village said: "Go back and hold a meeting of hired and poor peasants first, break through their thinking, and organize the hired and poor peasants who have not participated. All the fruits of the cooperative should be returned and given to the hired and poor peasants who cannot produce." The head of the @Shan Cooperative said at the meeting: "Go back and return all the fruits of struggle from the cooperative and distribute them to the hired and poor peasants who cannot produce. We must not abuse the fruits like we did before, using the fruits of struggle to make up for all the expenses of the village and to patch up the loopholes of middle peasants."

	Our Opinion

The fact that the broad masses of hired and poor peasants have not been thoroughly emancipated and are expressing dissatisfaction in winter production, demanding to be masters of their own affairs, and demanding a reasonable distribution of the fruits of victory is an extremely gratifying phenomenon. This enthusiasm is extremely valuable and is the foundation for the victory of implementing the Land Law. Li Shuangli, an old-time farmhand in Zhengzhao Village, Shahe, said it well: "It's not that we couldn't do it in the past, it's that we had no power." The hired and poor peasants' demand to "be masters of their own affairs" and "liberate themselves" is completely consistent with the spirit of the Land Law and the Central Bureau's Land Conference's regulations to "organize farmers' associations and farmers' representative conferences with poor peasants as the foundation" and "all power belongs to the farmers' representative conferences." The "cadre monopoly," "condescending viewpoint," and "top-down organization of hired and poor peasant meetings to break through their thinking" mentioned in this news are all wrong and not in line with the class line. They cannot form a class force with hired and poor peasants as the backbone to fight against landlords and rich peasants and fully satisfy the demands of the peasants. We believe that today, when the Land Law has been promulgated, everything should be done in accordance with the spirit of the Land Law and the Central Bureau's Land Conference. All methods that violate the Land Law are called "illegal." It is best to leave the undistributed fruits in a thorough and equal distribution. The difficulties of hired and poor peasants in winter production can be solved by seeking solutions from loans. In some places where there are special difficulties and distribution is unavoidable, it is necessary to consult the higher authorities with extreme caution and responsibility and act in accordance with the principles of the Chinese Land Law. Here, we want to remind everyone that after the Land Law is promulgated, some cadres may be eager to push the fruits that have not been distributed for many years to the hired and poor peasants in a perfunctory manner to cover up their past mistakes. This is illegal and criminal behavior, and if discovered, they will be held accountable in the future. We also hope that cadres and correspondents in various places will reflect all thoughts and practices that violate the Land Law with a responsible attitude towards the people.

　　停止干部包办乱分果实
  　要按土地法办事，否则便是违法
    【本报消息】太行有些地方，正在清查果实，分给雇贫农闹冬季生产。这些果实为什么好长时间没有分？现在才分，到底是不是真正为了雇贫的利益？分的是不是完全公道合乎土地法精神？是不是真正走了发动雇贫的阶级路线？在通讯员的来稿中，这些问题都没有说明，这次分配果实，是通过自上而下的干部路线来进行的，不少地方地主富农仍在操纵村里大权，干部中富农路线及压制群众作风没有解决，雇贫仍未翻身。在这种情形下，来一个十分草率的分配，可以肯定的说，绝不会真正的满足雇贫的要求，更无法符合中国土地法大纲的精神。从雇贫农、乡村工人及一切少地无地农民的长久利益来打算，这样做，是不好的。下面是各种材料提供大家研究。
    潞城五区在上月二十七日召开村干部会议，检查冬季生产，发现有好多雇贫没法参加生产。“李玉则是雇农出身，在运动中没有翻透身。村干部动员他去修路，他不去。干部都说他是懒汉，有享乐思想。后来经过干部和他个别谈话，发现了不愿出门干活的原因是没有被子盖。”以后干部就检讨起来，高庄村长高仁保说：“自己翻了身，买上了大骡子，只管自己生产，倒把穷人忘了。”“大家一致认为不该怨雇贫不参加生产，是干部自己没有深入给他们解决困难”。大家提出分配遗留的斗争果实。据全区的统计现存果实洋一千零八十六万零五百元，完全分给雇贫群众作为生产资金。另把以前放到合作社的果实八百六十九万二千元分给雇贫群众，作为生产资金。
    　　　　是干部解决雇贫困难
    长治二区南庄合作社的股金大部是斗争果实，各种实物按现在市价估计，能值一百七十六万三千元。全村共入股二十八万三千多元，里面有四十四户雇贫、六十四户中农、二十一户富中农、六户富农、二十三户斗争对象入股，按股分红，雇贫吃了大亏。里面有两个会计，一个是“三青团”靳双好，一个是“三保险”王招孩，王招孩过去在村上当了二十多年会计，不劳动，在村上就掌权。他们把合作社弄得一塌糊涂，总共赚了毛利三十九万九千多元，他们的伙食开支就有三十九万九千多元。在二十三日，召开了七十五户雇贫会议，决定把合作社所有果实，全部分配给雇贫与没劳力军烈属。大家说：“这可好啦，政府真是给咱谋利益哩！”
    　　　　政府召开雇贫会议一下子就把果实分了
    沙河正招村开了雇贫会议，“大家明确认识到过去自己没权吃了大亏。”决定“把农会的东西拿出来给咱当本钱”。张具的说：“农会里有树和木材，咱们伙成小木厂，又有活作又有柴烧。使钱也要咱们共同研究，看谁该使多少，就使多少。保证不能浪费或把钱买的吃了。农会果实和村财政要快整理，整出多少就先拿出来交给咱搞生产。”“第二天村干部们就下手整理……”经过一整天的时间，农会已整出的有：树木共值五十万元，民兵杂货铺用款三十万元，三个柏木棺材、锡二百斤、籽花一百斤、黑豆三布袋、金戒指两个、金簪子一个，另外群众还借用现款十万元。其他要迅速变款，村干部们检讨道：“过去咱就没有看见这伙人，可怨咱们眼光错了”。
    　　　　村长打通贫雇思想再分果实
    高邑二区村干部开会检查冬季生产，谈到今后的作法，前庄头村长说：“回去先开雇贫农会议，打通思想，把没有参加的雇贫也组织起来，合作社果实，一律退出，还给无法生产的雇贫”。＠珊合作社长在会上这样说：“回去把合作社的斗争果实，一律退出，分给无法生产的雇贫农。不能象以前那样；愁不愁，斗争果实一块肉的滥用果实，来补村上一切开支，补中农被门户窟窿。”
    　　　　我们的意见
    广大雇贫农翻身不彻底，在冬季生产中表示不满，要求当家，要求合理分配果实，是极其可喜的现象，这种热情极其宝贵，是执行土地法的胜利基础，沙河正招村几十年老长工李双立说的好：“过去也不是咱不能干，是咱没有权的过”。雇贫要求“当家”，“自己解放自己”，这种要求与土地法的精神及中央局土地会议“以贫农作为基础组织农会及农代会”，“一切权力归农代会”的规定，是完全一致的。这个消息中指的“干部包办”，“恩赐观点”，“自上而下的组织雇贫会议打通思想”等作法都不对，不是阶级路线，不能形成以雇贫为骨干的阶级力量来向地主富农斗争，来充分满足农民要求。我们认为在土地法已经公布的今天，一切都应按土地法及中央局土地会议的精神办事，一切违犯土地法的办法都叫“违法”，各地未分的果实，最好留在彻底平分中合理分配，雇贫农冬季生产困难，可从贷款中想办法，有些地方有特殊困难，非分不可，那就要极其慎重极其负责地请示上级，按照中国土地法原则来办，在这里，我们要提醒大家，土地法公布后，可能有一部分干部急于把长年不分的果实马马虎虎地推给雇贫，掩盖自己过去的错误，这是违法犯罪行为，如有发现，将来一定追究。并希望各地干部及通讯员以对人民负责的态度，反映一切违背土地法的思想和做法。
