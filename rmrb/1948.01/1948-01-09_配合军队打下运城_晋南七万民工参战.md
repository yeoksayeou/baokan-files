　　Coordinating with the Army to Capture Yuncheng
　　70,000 Civilian Laborers from Southern Shanxi Participate in the Battle
　　[This newspaper's dispatch from the Southern Shanxi Front on the 6th] When the People's Liberation Army attacked Yuncheng, 75,000 civilian laborers and 9,000 carts from the entire Taiyue area bravely participated in the operation. When the civilian laborers set out, they were all determined to resolutely complete their tasks. The Yangcheng Yucheng District Team put forward four "no fears": no fear of hardship, no fear of difficulties, no fear of going to the front lines, and no fear of long hours. The stretcher team from Hongdong wrote a guarantee to their superiors stating: "Resolutely complete the task, fear no sacrifice, and rescue the wounded under enemy fire." From the start of the battle on the 17th, they worked day and night, launching a campaign to care for the wounded. The Hongdong Xing Quanbao stretcher team, ignoring meals, carried the wounded, saying, "It doesn't matter if we miss a meal or two." Yangcheng civilian laborer Zhang Xianglong and five others were tasked with transporting equipment, but they went to the front lines and rescued the wounded under artillery fire. The civilian laborers of Wanquan fought alongside the troops, demolishing a wall in an hour, clearing the way for artillery fire. Jincheng civilian laborer Chen Tingfu led everyone in digging fortifications under enemy fire, enabling the troops to quickly complete their combat preparations. The transportation teams showed unprecedented speed. One transportation team, transporting siege equipment from ×× to the front lines, traveled 120 li in 14 hours, enabling the troops to receive the equipment in time and construct fortifications. Twenty-seven militia platoons from the First, Second, and Fourth Military Sub-districts actively undertook the arduous tasks of escorting the wounded, transporting ammunition, and guarding prisoners. Civilian laborers from Tunliu also bravely cooperated with the troops, undertaking flank security. On the day Yuncheng was captured, 2,000 carts transported supplies day and night without stopping.
　　[This newspaper's dispatch from the Southern Shanxi Front on the 6th] There are more than 300 large and small bunkers inside and outside Yuncheng, including tall and large "high bunkers" and "ground bunkers" that crawl on the ground. They are all made of steel rails, steel plates, and foreign lime, making them very strong. The enemy called them "copper walls and iron ramparts, impossible to break through," but this did not stop the People's Liberation Army from attacking. Yuncheng was quickly captured by the People's Liberation Army. More than 20,000 civilian laborers have now begun to dismantle these tortoise shells and will soon completely dismantle them.

　　配合军队打下运城
  　晋南七万民工参战
    【本报晋南前线六日电】人民解放军打运城的时候，太岳全区七万五千民工和九千辆大车，很勇敢的参加作战。民工在出发的时候，都抱定决心，要坚决完成任务。阳城钰成区队提出四不怕：不怕吃苦，不怕困难，不怕上火线，不怕时间长。洪洞担架小组给上级写的保证书上说：坚决完成任务，不怕牺牲，在敌人炮火下，抢救伤员。从十七日战斗开始，他们即日夜紧张工作，展开爱护伤员运动。洪洞邢全保担架队不顾吃饭，抬送伤员，他们说：“一两顿饭不吃没有什么要紧。”阳城民工张翔龙等六个人，是运输器材的任务，可是他们走到阵地上，还冒着炮火抢救伤员。万泉民工与部队并肩作战，一点钟内拆毁一座墙，给炮兵扫除了射击障碍。晋城民工陈廷福，领导大家在敌人炮火下挖工事，使部队很快完成作战准备。运输队表现空前的快，某运输队，从××运攻坚器材到前线，十四点钟就走了一百二十里，使部队及时得到器材，构筑工事。一、二、四分区二十七个民兵连，都积极的担负护送伤员、押运弹药、看守俘虏的艰苦任务。屯留民工还英勇的配合部队，担负侧翼的警戒。攻克运城的当天，两千辆大车日夜不停的搬运物资。
    【本报晋南前线六日电】运城内外一共有三百多个大小碉堡，有又高又大的“高碉”，也有爬在地上的“伏地碉”，都是用钢轨、钢板、洋石灰做成的，很结实，敌人说是“铜墙铁壁，攻打不破”，可是这也没有挡住人民解放军的攻打，运城很快就被人民解放军打下来了。现在已有二万多民工，动手拆毁这些乌龟壳，很快就能把他完全拆尽。
