　　Land Law Must Not Be Violated!
  　Bai Shan Village Exposes Illegal Acts of Registered Landlords
    [Taihang News] Bai Shan Village, She County, 7th District, used the Taihang Administrative Office's proclamation prohibiting the violation of the Land Law as a weapon to stop the illegal acts of landlords selling buried property. On the 16th, when the village cadres discussed the Administrative Office's proclamation, Political Director Wang Zhuyuan said before the words had even faded, "The landlord Niu Faqi is undermining our Land Law. Yesterday, he secretly sold a tung tree from the lumber mill." Then Chen Shuqi also said, "The feudal rich peasant Niu Gun's heard about the equal distribution of land and is rushing to sell his flock of sheep." Discovering these two things, the village cadres became more vigilant about the destructive activities of the landlords. That night, they convened a small-scale cooperative of the entire village to check the things the landlords had secretly sold and the shares of the people. They discovered many more things: The shares of the landlords Niu Qingwen and Niu Yuanzhou in the small-scale cooperative amounted to 61,000 yuan, and they secretly took away 45,000 yuan the day before. The landlord Chen Guibao hid a donkey at his relatives' house. Wang Shouyi secretly sold a small donkey. The landlord Niu Jizhao was recklessly prostituting himself, cutting away the paper mulberry bark already distributed to the poor peasants, and the peasants dared not say anything. Some landlords even altered our slogans. Now these things have all been registered, ready to be dealt with when the land is equally distributed.
    Editor's note: It is very good that the village cadres are paying attention to and are vigilant about the landlords' violation of the Land Law. However, it is more important to earnestly and deeply penetrate among the poor and hired peasants, and patiently explain and interpret the law to them. Only when the poor and hired peasants consciously grasp the weapon of the land can they more forcefully stop the landlords' sabotage and make ideological preparations for the upcoming land distribution movement.

　　土地法不容破坏！
  　白芟登记地主非法行为
    【太行消息】涉县七区白芟村拿太行行署禁止破坏土地法的布告作武器，制止地主变卖埋藏财物的非法行为。十六号该村村干部讨论行署布告时，声音未落，政治主任王竹元就说：“地主牛发其破坏咱们的土地法，昨天找木工厂偷卖桐树一棵”。接着陈树其也说：“封建富农牛滚的听到土地平分，正急着卖他那一群羊”。发现了这两宗事情，村干部对地主的破坏活动更警惕起来，当天黑夜便召集全村小型合作社，检查地主偷卖的东西和人的股金，又发现了好多事情：地主牛庆文、牛元周在小型合作社存的股金有六万一千元，前日偷取去四万五千元。地主陈贵保在他亲戚家隐藏着一头驴。王守义偷卖了一头小驴。地主牛计召嫖猖狂，把已分给贫民的楮皮割去，农民不敢吭声。有些地主甚至擦改我们的标语，现在这些事情都已登记起来，准备平分土地时处理。
    按编者：村干部注意与警惕了地主破坏土地法这是很好的。但是，更重要的是认真深入贫雇，向他们耐心的宣传解释；只有贫雇自觉的掌握了土地个武器，才能更有力的制止地主的破坏，并给就要到来的都分土地运动，作了的思想准备。
