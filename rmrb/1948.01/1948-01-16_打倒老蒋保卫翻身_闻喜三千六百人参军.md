　　Down with Old Chiang, Defend Our Liberation
  　Wenxi: 3,600 People Join the Army
    [Taiyue News] In Wenxi County, liberated peasants, in order to defend the fruits of their liberation and thoroughly defeat Chiang Kai-shek, have launched a wave of enthusiasm for joining the army under the call of the Wenxi County Committee of the Communist Party and the Farmers' Association. As of the 2nd, 3,600 young and strong men in the county had signed up for the army. Sang Yuxi, a poor peasant from Nancun in the First District, said: "I fought in the 359th Brigade of the Eighth Route Army for more than eight years during the War of Resistance Against Japan. I retired because I was getting old. I am willing to send my son to join the People's Liberation Army." Niu Dehe from Niuzhuang in the Second District said: "The Eighth Route Army is led by the Communist Party. People who are not Communist Party members still join the army. We are Communist Party members, so we should go even more." In Weicun in the Third District, the method of discussing the past and comparing it with the present was used, arousing everyone's resentment towards Chiang Kai-shek. Young men and women in Weicun all scrambled to sign up for the army. Li Anwa from Jieyuan Village in the Fourth District said: "In the past, I was oppressed by bandits, which made me unable to eat or dress warmly. Now that I have been liberated, I have food and clothing, and I have also joined the Communist Party. I want to play an exemplary role and go to the front line, and I will only come back to see everyone after capturing Chiang Kai-shek alive." His wife, Zhang Yumei, said on the spot: "Good, good, you go to join the army, I will take care of the family affairs, you don't have to worry about it!"
