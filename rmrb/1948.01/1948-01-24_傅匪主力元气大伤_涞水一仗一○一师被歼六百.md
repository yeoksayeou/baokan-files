Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 22nd. Our reporter Yang Shuo reports: The 101st Division of the 35th Army, known as the main force of Fu Zuoyi's bandit army, was badly battered this time southeast of Laishui, and fled in terror. When the People's Liberation Army attacked the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway at the end of December, the division rushed from its old nest in Zhangjiakou to reinforce it. However, it was ambushed and flanked along the way, and was beaten into a daze. On the evening of the 11th of this month, our regiment attacked Laishui. Bandit Fu hurriedly sent Guo Jingyun, the commander of the division, with the 301st and 303rd regiments, to rescue them from Dingxing at dawn on the 12th. Just nine miles across the Juma River, they were surrounded by the People's Liberation Army in Wucun, Gaoluo and other places 20 miles southeast of Laishui. The fog was heavy that day, and at 5 p.m. we began to attack from the south, west and north. The artillery fire was fierce, and the soldiers fought bravely, beating the bandits into a state of despair. Division Commander Guo Jingyun supervised the battle in Wucun and, seeing that the situation was unsustainable, ordered the 303rd Regiment to risk their lives to retreat from Gaoluo to Wucun overnight. Before dawn, he personally led the newly withdrawn regiment across the river and fled to Bainanhouchun Village, leaving the 301st Regiment struggling desperately to cover the wounded. At this time, the puppet army Liu Hua's troops were stationed in Dingxing, although they were only ten miles away, they dared not come to the rescue. On the afternoon of the 13th, we began the general attack. The artillery fire was strong and accurate, and the enemy was beaten into a chaotic retreat. Ignoring the cold water, they rushed across the river to escape to Dingxing. At this time, some of our soldiers tracked and pursued them. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy turned around and ran towards Gaobeidian, but the pursuing artillery fire bloomed everywhere, forcing the enemy to flee westward again. All that could be seen was the collision of vehicles and horses, and the overturning of men and horses, creating utter chaos. Our soldiers chased back and forth, annihilating more than 600 enemies one after another, and the enemy fled back to the stronghold of Gaobeidian. The 101st Division of the 35th Army, on which Fu Zuoyi relied to make his fortune, has since suffered a great loss of vitality.

　　傅匪主力元气大伤
  　涞水一仗一○一师被歼六百
    【新华社晋察冀前线廿二日电】本社记者杨朔报导：号称傅匪作义主力的三十五军一○一师这回在涞水东南被我打得头破血流，胆战心惊，四散奔逃。解放军在十二月底破击平汉北段时，该师从张家口老巢仓皇赶来增援。可是沿途遭我阻击、侧击，被打得昏头昏脑。本月十一日晚，我团攻涞水，傅匪慌忙派该师师长郭景云带着三○一和三○三两团在十二日黎明从定兴跑来援救，刚过拒马河九里地，就被解放军包围在涞水东南二十里的吴村、高洛等地。当天大雾迷蒙，下午五点我从南、西、北三面开始攻击，炮火猛烈，战士奋勇，把傅匪打得丧魂落魄，师长郭景云在吴村督战，见大势不支，连夜叫三○三团冒死从高洛撤到吴村，天色未亮就又亲自带着刚撤来的该团过河向白南侯村逃去，剩下三○一团拼命挣扎，掩护伤兵轻重。此时，伪军刘化南部驻于定兴，虽相隔十里，而不敢出救。十三日下午我开始总攻，炮兵火力旺盛准确，敌人被打得乱跑，不顾水冷，急忙过河向定兴逃命。这时，我一部战士跟踪追击，敌人见势不对，扭头又朝高碑店跑，可是追击炮火遍地开花，逼得敌人又往西窜。只见车马辎重乱碰乱撞，人仰马翻，乱成一团。我军战士往来追赶，先后歼敌六百余人，歼敌逃回高碑店据点。傅作义赖以发家的三十五军一○一师，自此已经元气大伤了。
