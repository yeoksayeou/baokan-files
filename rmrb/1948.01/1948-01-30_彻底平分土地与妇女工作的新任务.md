　　Thorough Land Redistribution and New Tasks for Women's Work
    Deng Yingchao

    In the past two years, under the leadership of our Party, the peasants in the liberated areas have carried out a vigorous land reform movement and achieved great victories. Tens of millions of landless and land-poor peasants and the broad masses of rural working women have been involved in this movement. They have destroyed the feudal forces in the countryside that had existed for thousands of years. They have not only acquired land and means of production but have also greatly raised their class consciousness and political enthusiasm. Therefore, they have turned themselves over economically and politically. In particular, the great strength of working women has been more clearly demonstrated in this movement. They have shown unprecedented scale and heroic posture in various anti-feudal struggles in the land reform movement, on the production front, in supporting the front and undertaking rear service work, and in various work positions in the countryside replacing men. In the struggle against landlords, their suffering often played a leading role. In pursuing the hidden wealth of landlords, they often carefully and meticulously broke the enemy's tricks in places that ordinary people easily overlooked. In some areas, men fought Chiang Kai-shek's troops at the front, while women distributed land and dug up Chiang's roots in the rear. In some areas, the broad masses of women have become the main force of production; in some areas, working women have stood in positions of power in the countryside; in some areas, women have made significant contributions to supporting the front, such as making shoes, sewing clothes, milling flour, husking rice, short-distance transportation, and caring for the wounded and sick. These all illustrate that women are an extremely important force that cannot be ignored in reforming the land system and in the patriotic self-defense war. Therefore, mobilizing the broad masses of working women to actively participate in land reform is an indispensable and extremely important component of the entire movement. Facts tell us that without mobilizing the rural working women to participate in land reform, it is impossible to completely and thoroughly eliminate feudal remnants.

    However, the Party committees in various liberated areas have not paid enough attention to mobilizing and leading women to participate in land reform. Except for a few areas where there is a clear understanding and active, conscious, and planned attention is given, women's work is generally neglected, spontaneous, and without leadership. Therefore, the National Land Conference, in summing up the experience of land reform in the past two years, emphasized that in order to thoroughly redistribute land and eliminate feudal forces in the future, the Party's leadership organs at all levels must enhance and strengthen women's work.

    Recently, the Central Committee of our Party promulgated the "Outline Land Law of China," which, based on the demands of the peasants and the experience of land reform, stipulates the elimination of feudal and semi-feudal exploitation of the land system and the implementation of a land system where those who till the land own it. The promulgation of this land law outline, which has great historical significance, will set off a more enthusiastic and magnificent high tide of the land revolution movement among millions of peasants, especially in the liberated areas. Party committees at all levels must attract broad masses of rural working women to actively participate in this great revolutionary movement, calling on women to unite closely with the broad masses of peasants for their own liberation, in order to form a strong force to launch and implement the land reform movement and complete the basic tasks of the Chinese revolution.

    Therefore, in order to achieve this goal, the National Land Conference, based on the experience of land reform in various liberated areas, emphasized that the following points should be given special attention in current women's work:

    (1) Take land reform as the center, integrate women's work with land reform, and integrate the women's movement with the peasant movement. The close combination of the two can promote each other and complement each other. Rural working women and other peasants suffer from the exploitation and oppression of the landlord class and have common demands and common interests. Therefore, in the movement to thoroughly redistribute land in various places, it is necessary to mobilize the rural working women at the same time as mobilizing the peasant masses. There should be no distinction between prioritizing men and subordinating women, let alone the practice of casually bringing them along or taking advantage of them, or abandoning or avoiding the work of deeply mobilizing the broad masses of poor and hired peasant women under various pretexts such as backwardness, verbosity, trouble, annoyance, and difficulty, causing women's work to fall into a state of spontaneity and drift.

    (2) In mobilizing and organizing rural women, poor and hired peasant women should be the backbone, uniting middle peasant women, and implementing the mass line in all aspects. In the past, the class viewpoint and class line in rural women's work were long blurred, and in practice, it revolved around landlord and rich peasant women above the middle peasant level, floated on the upper level, monopolized and replaced, and thus became detached from the basic rural women masses. This error must be corrected in the future. We should go deep into the masses of poor and hired peasant women, work patiently and meticulously, become one with them, understand and understand their sufferings and demands, and wholeheartedly serve them. Start with older and middle-aged women first, and use methods such as turning hearts, telling sufferings, dividing classes, tracing the roots of poverty, comparing sufferings, comparing prospects, and comparing days to enlighten their class consciousness and make them distinguish themselves from landlords and rich peasants. In the movement, special attention should be paid to cultivating and promoting women activists to participate in various leadership positions. At the same time, the "Outline Land Law" should be more widely publicized and explained among the peasant and women masses, and this outline should be effectively implemented to truly ensure that women receive land in the same way as men and have ownership. When distributing floating wealth, attention should be paid to the different needs between men and women and families, so that women can raise their interest in land from their love of floating wealth, and raise their awareness of the interests of the entire class from their personal demands. Unite with all the oppressed peasants to eliminate the common enemy—the landlord class. Only in this way can millions of women be bravely engaged in the movement of thoroughly redistributing land to eliminate the feudal exploitation of the land system and achieve thorough economic and political liberation.

    (3) In the countryside, working, peasant, and poor women should be absorbed into the poor peasant associations, peasant associations, cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and literacy groups according to their social components. The rural women's federation should work under the unified leadership of the peasant association. The peasant association can set up a women's department (also known as the women's federation). In the peasant representative meeting and its committee, attention must be paid to absorbing women activists to participate. The method of organizing women members, whether mixed with peasants or organized separately, can be selected in consultation with local conditions and the peasant and women masses. However, no matter what form is adopted, attention should be paid to giving women members equal opportunities for training and improving their political awareness and work ability as a principle. Rural women's federations that have not yet joined the peasant association should join immediately, and the composition of the members of the women's federation should be reviewed, and landlord and rich peasant elements should be eliminated.

    (4) In places where land reform has been completed, all efforts should be made to mobilize and organize the broad masses of working women to participate in the production movement. Women have made great contributions to production and supporting the front in the past. For example, in some areas, in order to supply the troops with food during combat, women milled flour and husked rice, reaching hundreds of thousands to more than one million kilograms per day. In order to solve the needs of field army clothing, the women in Southern Hebei completed the supply of 800,000 bolts of cloth one and a half months ahead of schedule. In some areas of Shandong and Taihang, this year's spring plowing was mainly completed by women. Now that the scale of the war is expanding, a large number of young and middle-aged men are constantly going to the front, so women have a glorious task in developing production and supporting the long-term self-defense war to achieve the final victory. For this reason, many systematic propaganda and organizational work are needed. In terms of production, the focus should be on organizing women to participate in agricultural labor, and according to local conditions, develop various side businesses and handicrafts, and special attention should be paid to organizing women to learn various production techniques, especially agricultural techniques. We must be good at organizing rural labor mutual aid, breaking the customs that women are ashamed to go to the fields and foot binding, which hinder women from participating in production, so as to greatly develop production and adapt to the huge needs of supporting the war. Various front-line support work also needs to be better organized for women to participate. In all kinds of work, the principle of women's consciousness and voluntariness should be taken as the principle, and the style of forced command should be corrected.

    (5) During and after the completion of land reform, when mobilizing the people to carry out the democratic movement, it is necessary to mobilize women to actively participate in order to more extensively transform democratic governments, mass organizations, and various organizations and cadres of the Party, as well as the struggle against bureaucratic degenerates, so that the development of the democratic movement can reach greater depth and breadth. At the same time, in accordance with the principles of equality between men and women and democratic freedom, the various democratic rights that women deserve should be realized, and special attention should be paid to promoting activists from among the working, peasant, and poor women to participate in democratic governments, mass organizations, and various work of the Party at all levels. The leading organs of party committees and various organizations at all levels must often provide them with the most concerned help and training, train their ability to handle affairs, production skills, and improve their cultural and political level, so that in the situation where a large number of men continue to go to the front, women can replace men in various work in the rear. In mobilizing women to actively participate in the land reform, production, and democratic movements of the entire masses, conscious attention should be paid to gradually solving women's own problems (such as forced arranged marriages and some feudal bad habits that restrict women's freedom to participate in social activities), and women's movements should not be separated from the entire mass movement, that is to say, in the entire movement, the oppression and shackles left by the feudal system on women should be broken, as well as the old rules, old morals, and old ideas of women left over from the patriarchal society, so that women who are undergoing major changes can improve and improve their status in the family and in society and establish new rules, new morals, and new ideas. In carrying out these tasks, the sympathy of the peasants should be won, and long-term ideological education work should be carried out among the masses in order to completely eliminate the remnants of the feudal system.

    (6) In the land reform, production movement, and front-line support work in the past two years, a large number of new women cadres have emerged. At the same time, some of the original women cadres have also gone to the countryside to participate in grassroots practical work, but it is far from meeting the needs of the development of the movement. For the greater development and needs of various movements, a large number of female cadres should be sent to work. We call on all female cadres who can go to the countryside to overcome all difficulties, go deep into the working, peasant, and poor women, insist on working and learning and exercising. Party committees at all levels should pay close attention to cultivating and promoting female comrades who can do this to participate in various leading organs, and support them in solving various difficulties, so that they can get opportunities to learn and transform. The female cadres themselves must work hard to study, transform, and improve themselves from the education of the people in the great land reform, so that they can be diligent servants who are good at serving the people, especially the most oppressed women.

    At the National Land Conference, it was emphasized that the basic key to whether the above points can be thoroughly carried out lies in the fact that the Party committees at all levels must have a fully clear mass viewpoint in their leading ideology, attach importance to the strength of the women, and overcome the viewpoint of excluding women and the thought of belittling women. The leading organs should raise women's work to the task of the entire Party, and should not regard it as only the work of a few female comrades. Every party member should serve the broad masses of working women. Women's work can be done not only by female comrades, but also by male comrades. Moreover, the facts in some areas have proved that as long as male comrades overcome some ideological obstacles that they cannot do women's work, they can also do it very well.

    From the materials of the National Land Conference, it can be seen that women's work in some areas has not only made new progress, but also has a clear understanding. We believe that the National Land Conference will become a historically significant turning point in the women's work of the entire Party. In the future, with the efforts of the entire Party, in the high tide of the land revolution in the entire liberated area and in the development of production and democratic movements, women's work will present a new look. The broad masses of labor, including women, will be liberated from all feudal shackles. And they will have more power and more quickly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, thoroughly overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's rule in the entire country, and strive for the thorough victory of the New Democratic Revolution in the whole of China.

　　彻底平分土地与妇女工作的新任务
    邓颖超
    两年来解放区的农民在我党领导之下，进行了轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动，获得了伟大的胜利。成千万无地少地农民与广大农村劳动妇女都卷入了这个运动。他们摧毁了乡村里数千年的封建势力，他们不仅获得了土地和生产工具，而且大大地提高了阶级觉悟和政治积极性。因此，他们在经济上和政治上都翻了身。特别是劳动妇女的伟大力量，在这一运动中更明显地表现出来了。她们在土地改革运动的各种反封建斗争中，在生产战线上，在支援前线与担负后方勤务工作上，以及在农村里代替男子的各种工作岗位上，都表现了前所未有的规模与英雄的姿态。在斗争地主时，她们的诉苦，往往起了带头作用。在追索地主浮财时，她们往往在一般人易于疏忽的地方仔细入微地击破了敌人的诡计，甚至在有些地区男人在前方打蒋匪，女人在后方分田地、挖蒋根。有些地区广大的妇女成为生产的主力军；有些地区劳动妇女在乡村中已站在当权的地位；有些地区妇女在支援前线工作中，如做鞋、缝衣、磨面、碾米、短距离抬运、看护伤病员等工作上，也都作了重大的贡献。这些都说明了妇女是改革土地制度和爱国自卫战争中一个不可忽视的极重要的力量。因此，在土地改革中，发动广大劳动妇女群众来积极参加，实在是整个运动中不可缺少与极重要的组成部分。事实告诉我们：不发动农村劳动妇女群众参加土地改革，就不可能彻底完全消灭封建残余。
    但解放区各地党对于发动与领导妇女群众参加土地改革，除个别地区有明确的认识并主动地有意识有计划地予以注意外，一般说来，还重视得不够。在大多数地区，妇女工作仍是被忽视的、自流的、没有领导的。因此，全国土地会议在总结两年来土改的经验时，着重指出：今后为了彻底平分土地、消灭封建势力，党的各级领导机关必须提高与加强妇女工作。
    最近我党中央公布了“中国土地法大纲”，它根据农民的要求及土地改革的经验，规定了消灭封建性及半封建性剥削的土地制度，实行耕者有其田的土地制度。这一个具有伟大历史意义的土地法大纲之公布，将要在全国特别是在解放区千百万农民群众中，掀起更热烈更雄伟的土地革命运动的高潮。各地党委必须吸引广大的农村劳动妇女，积极参加这一伟大的革命运动，号召妇女群众为了自己的解放与广大农民密切团结在一起，以便组成一支强有力的队伍，去展开及贯彻土地改革运动，完成中国革命的基本任务。
    因此，全国土地会议为了达到这个目的，根据各解放区土地改革的经验，曾着重指出当前妇女工作应特别注意下列几点：
    （一）要以土地改革为中心，使妇女工作与土地改革结合，妇女运动与农民运动结合。两者密切结合，可以相互推动，相得益彰。农村劳动妇女与其他农民同受地主阶级的剥削和压迫，具有共同的要求，共同的利害。因此，在各地进行彻底平分土地的运动中，发动农民群众时，必须同时发动农村劳动妇女群众，不应有先男后女主从之分，更不应有捎带一下、利用一下的做法，或以落后、＠嗦、麻烦、讨厌、困难种种借口，即放弃或避开深入发动广大贫雇农妇女的工作，使妇女工作陷于自发自流的状态。
    （二）在发动与组织农村妇女群众时，要以贫雇农妇女为骨干，团结中农妇女，贯彻群众路线于各方面。过去农村妇女工作中的阶级观点与阶级路线是长期模糊的，实际是在中农以上的地主富农妇女中兜圈子，浮在上层，包办代替，因而脱离了农村基本妇女群众。今后必须纠正这个错误，应深入贫雇农妇女群众中去，不卷的耐心地进行工作，和她们打成一片，熟悉和了解她们的痛苦与要求，衷心为她们服务。首先从老、壮年妇女入手，可采用翻心、诉苦、划阶级、追穷根、比苦、比光景、比日子等方式启发她们的阶级觉悟，使她们与地主富农分清界线。在运动中，更要特别注意培养与提拔妇女积极分子去参加各种领导工作，同时在农民与妇女群众中更广泛地宣传和解释土地法大纲，并切实贯彻这个大纲，真正作到妇女与男子一样分得土地，并有所有权。在分配浮财时，要注意男女及家庭之间的不同需要，使妇女从喜爱浮财提高到对土地的兴趣，从个人的要求出发，提高到对整个阶级利益的认识。同被压迫的全体农民团结在一起，去消灭共同的敌人——地主阶级。只有这样，在平分土地的运动中，才能使千百万妇女群众勇敢的去进行消灭封建剥削的土地制度，达到经济上、政治上的彻底解放。
    （三）在乡村中，工农贫民妇女应按各人社会成份吸收她们加入贫农团、农会、合作社及互助组、识字组中，乡村妇女联合会应在农会统一领导下工作，农会可设妇女部（亦即妇联会），在农民代表会及其委员会中，必须注意吸收妇女的积极分子参加。妇女会员编组的方法，无论是与农民混合编组或单独编组，可依照当地情况与农民及妇女群众商量选定，但不管采用何种形式，均应注意给女会员以同等锻炼的机会，提高她们的政治觉悟和工作能力为原则。农村妇联会尚未加入农会者，应即加入，并审查妇联会的会员的成份，淘汰地主、富农分子。
    （四）在土地改革完成的地方，应以全力发动和组织广大劳动妇女参加生产运动。妇女在生产与支前中，过去曾作了巨大的贡献。如有些地区为了供应部队作战时的给养，妇女们磨面、碾米，每天达数十万至百余万斤。为了解决野战军服装的需要，冀南的妇女于一个半月内提早完成了八十万匹布的供给。在山东、太行某些地区，今年的春耕主要是依靠妇女完成的。现在战争规模日益扩大，大批的青壮年男子不断上前线，因此，妇女在发展生产支援长期自卫战争以取得最后胜利上，负有光荣的任务。为此，需要进行许多有系统的宣传、组织工作。在生产方面，应以组织妇女参加农业劳动为主，并根据各地的条件，发展各种副业及手工业，尤应注意进行组织妇女学习各种生产技术，特别是农业技术的训练。要善于组织农村的劳动互助，打破妇女下地为耻及缠足等各种阻碍妇女参加生产的习俗，以便大量地发展生产，适应支援战争的巨大需要。各种支前工作，也需要更好的组织妇女参加。在各种工作中，都要以妇女群众的自觉和自愿为原则，纠正强迫命令的作风。
    （五）在土地改革的过程中及完成以后，发动人民群众进行民主运动时，必须发动妇女群众积极参加，以便更广泛地进行改造民主政府、群众团体及党的各种组织与干部，以及反对官僚蜕化分子的斗争，使民主运动的发展能够达到更大的深度和广度。同时，依照男女平等及民主自由的原则，实现妇女应得的各种民主权利，并应切实注意提拔工农贫民妇女中的积极分子，参加各级民主政府、群众团体及党的各种工作。各级党委及各种组织的领导机关，要经常对她们进行最关心的帮助与培养，训练她们的办事能力、生产技术及提高她们的文化和政治水平，以便在大批男子不断走上前线的情况下，妇女能够代替男子在后方进行各种工作。应在发动妇女群众积极参加整个群众的土地改革、生产与民主运动中，有意识地注意逐渐解决妇女本身的各项问题（如强迫包办婚姻，以及限制妇女参加社会活动自由的一些封建陋习），不要使妇女运动离开了整个群众运动，即是说，在整个运动过程中，要打破封建制度残留在妇女方面的压迫与束缚，以及宗法社会遗留下来的对妇女旧规矩、旧道德、旧思想，使正在起着重大变化的妇女在家庭里、在社会上的地位能更加改进与提高，建立起新规矩、新道德、新思想。在进行这些工作时，应争取农民的同情，并应在群众中进行长期的思想教育工作，以便彻底消灭封建制度的残余。
    （六）在两年来的土地改革、生产运动与支援前线的工作中，已经涌现出了新的大批的妇女干部，同时，原有的妇女干部中也有一部分到农村参加了下层实际工作，但还远不能适应运动发展的需要。为了各种运动更大的开展和需要，应有大批的女干部去进行工作。我们号召一切可以下乡的妇女干部应克服一切困难，深入到工农贫民妇女中去，坚持工作并学习与锻炼。各级党委对能够这样做的女同志，应切实注意培养与提拔她们参加各种领导机关，并支助她们解决各种困难，使她们能够得到学习与改造的机会。而女干部自己更要在伟大的土地改革中，从人民群众的教育中，努力学习改造自己、提高自己，使自己能够做一个善于为人民服务，特别是为最受压迫的妇女群众服务的勤务员。
    在全国土地会议上，曾着重地指出：以上各点能否彻底进行，基本的关键就在于党的各级党委必须在领导思想上有充分明确的群众观点，重视妇女群众的力量，要克服妇女除外的观点及轻视妇女的思想。领导机关应把妇女工作提高成为全党的任务，不应把它看成只是少数女同志的工作。每个党员都要为广大劳动妇女服务，妇女工作不仅女同志能做，男同志也同样能做，而且有些地区的事实证明，男同志只要克服了不能做妇女工作的一些思想障碍后，亦能做得很好。
    从全国土地会议上的材料可以看出，某些地区的妇女工作，不仅有了新的进步，并且有了明确的认识，我们相信全国土地会议将成为全党妇女工作的有历史意义的转折点，今后在全党努力之下，在全解放区土地革命的高潮及开展生产与民主运动中，妇女工作将要呈现一个新的面貌。包括妇女在内的广大的劳动群众，将从一切封建束缚之下解放出来。并且更有力量更迅速地消灭蒋匪军，在全国范围内彻底推翻蒋介石的统治，争取新民主主义革命在全中国的彻底胜利。
