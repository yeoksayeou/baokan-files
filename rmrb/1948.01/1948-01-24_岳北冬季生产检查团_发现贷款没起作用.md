　　Yuebei Winter Production Inspection Team
  　Discovers Loans Were Ineffective
    [Taiyue News] The Yuebei Prefectural Commissioner's Office Winter Production Inspection Team inspected the loan work in Qinyuan, Qin County, Anze, Changzi and other counties and found that in some places, due to bureaucracy during the loan disbursement process, the meaning of the loans was not clearly explained. Some hired peasants did not know how to use the loans and feared they would not be able to repay them if they lost money. Additionally, due to other difficulties, they were afraid to take out loans. For example, one hired peasant in the Xiaohe Lian Village of Qin County firmly refused to take out a loan. Furthermore, some hired peasants still faced unresolved difficulties after taking out loans, making production impossible. For example, one hired peasant in Hanyang Village of Anze County had many difficulties after taking out a loan and could not find a way to engage in production. Fearing he would lose money, but also realizing that he had to pay interest even if he did not use the loan, he went up the mountain to chop firewood in order to prepare the interest payment, turning the loan into a burden. He said: "Regardless of whether I produce or not, I have to prepare the interest for the government." In some places, another problem occurred: substitution and monopolization. For example, in Hong＠ Village of Anze County, after the loans were issued, the production was managed centrally by the "lu" (a neighborhood unit), which dissatisfied the hired peasants who said: "We took out a loan, but we didn't even see what a Jinnan currency note looks like!" In Xiaonanshi Village of Changzi County, some hired peasants put the loans into cooperatives, and regardless of profit or loss, they were given two "jin" of cotton as a dividend per ten thousand yuan per month. In Sangqu, Anze, hired peasants were centrally organized to engage in speculative production by buying and selling grain and liquor. After understanding these serious phenomena, the Prefectural Commissioner's Office has telegraphed all counties to immediately correct them.

　　岳北冬季生产检查团
  　发现贷款没起作用
    【太岳消息】岳北专署冬季生产检查团，检查了沁源、沁县、安泽、长子等县的贷款工作，发现有些地方因为放款时官僚主义，没把贷款的意思说清楚，有些雇贫不知道怎样使用贷款，怕赔了还不起；又因为还有别的困难，就不敢贷。象沁县小河联村有个雇贫，就坚决不贷。又有些雇贫贷款后，还有困难没解决，没法生产。象安泽河阳村有个雇贫贷款后困难多，找不到生产门路，怕赔了钱，可是放着不用也得出利息，就上山砍柴，准备利钱，贷款变成了负担。他说：“生产不生产，得给公家准备上利钱。”又有些地方发生另一种毛病：代替包办。象安泽洪＠村贷款后，是以闾为单位集中经营生产，雇贫都不满意的说：“咱贷了一回款，连冀南票是个啥样都没见！”长子小南石村，有的雇贫把款入了合作社，不管赔赚，每万元每月给二斤花的红利。安泽桑曲是集中雇贫贷款搞投机生产，买卖粮食烧酒。专署了解了这些严重现象，已电令各县马上纠正。
