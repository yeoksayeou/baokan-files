　　Every Village Should Conduct Inspections
  　Xingcheng's Eight Impoverished Households Suffer Hunger and Cold
    [Ping Shun News] Xingcheng Village in the seventh district of Pingshun County is considered a large village in the entire district. The work on the surface appears to be good, but in reality, the impoverished peasants have not achieved liberation. The cadres are very active in their work, but they have a problem in their thinking. They believe that the impoverished peasants have already been thoroughly liberated. On January 13th, a household-by-household inspection was conducted in the village, going deep into the homes of impoverished peasants. In the three days until the 15th, it was discovered that eight households had no quilts to cover themselves, and one household had no cotton clothes to change into. For example, the impoverished peasant Shen Jixing's family has four members and six mu of land (inferior land, producing a total of four shi of grain), averaging one shi of grain per person. During the filling and leveling compensation last year, he repeatedly requested a quilt, but the village cadres did not respond. He was very active at the beginning of the struggle, but he didn't even get a quilt, and he didn't dare to ask for other fruits of the revolution. Li Wu is the most honest farmer, living in a mountain gully. His family has two members, cultivating hillside land. Now, there is no food at home to make a living. Not only is there no quilt on the kang, but there isn't even a broken mat. We asked him why he hadn't achieved thorough liberation. He said, "I am an honest farmer, and nothing I say matters." Li Panghan's family has four members and seven mu of land, actually harvesting five shi of grain. He said that he is an outsider. His father came here to work as a long-term laborer to make a living, and he also worked as a long-term laborer for three years. He started herding cattle at the age of eight and has been herding cattle for eleven years until he turned eighteen. The kang at home is covered with a broken quilt, with no benefits at all, just a pile of rags. He said, "When the village cadres notify us of meetings and errands, we arrive immediately. But when it comes to distributing the fruits of the revolution, they look down on us, and nothing we say matters. There isn't even a water vat at home. I said I wanted a small water vat, but the village cadres wouldn't allow it, scaring me so much that I didn't dare to mention anything. I think I am an outsider and can't get anywhere." His father continued, "I heard on the street that land will be divided soon, allowing the poor to take power and achieve liberation. I think I can achieve thorough liberation this time." In addition, there are five other households whose liberation is not thorough enough, and they currently have no quilts to cover themselves. After discovering this problem, the village chief, political director, and cooperative director were brought to personally inspect the homes of the eight impoverished peasants. The village cadres were speechless. A village cadre meeting was held at night to review whether there were any impoverished peasant viewpoints. The village chief, political director, and cooperative director reviewed: In the past, we shouted slogans about following the impoverished peasant line all winter, but as a result, the difficulties of the impoverished peasants were not resolved. From the rent reduction movement and struggle in 1942 until now, there are still these impoverished peasants without quilts, proving that the work is not thorough. After the review, everyone was determined to first solve the immediate difficulties of these families. (Jin Shui, De Quan)

　　村村都应做检查
  　杏城八户雇贫挨饿受冻
    【平顺消息】平顺七区杏城村，以全区说是个大村子，一般的工作表面上看是不错的，实际上雇贫农没有翻身。干部工作非常积极，但在思想上有个毛病，他们以为雇贫都翻透身了。一月十三日在该村进行了挨户检查，深入雇贫农，至十五日三天时间，检查出有八户没被子盖，有一户没换上棉衣。如雇贫申计兴家有人四口，土地六亩（下等地，产粮共四石），每人平均收粮一石。去年填平补齐时他再三要求分条被子，村干部没有答复。开始斗争，自己也很积极，连条被子也没有分上，其他果实也没敢要求。李五则是最老实的农民，住山沟里，家有两口人，种的是山坡地，现在家中就没粮糊口，炕上不但没有被子，连个破席子也没铺。我们问他为什么你就没翻透身，他说：“我是个老实农民，说什么也不顶事。”李胖汉家有人四口，土地七亩，实收粮五石。他说是外来户，他父亲来到这里住长工度生活，他也住了三年长工，他第八岁上放牛，到现在十八岁，放了十一年牛。家里炕上盖着一条破被子，没一点好处，是一堆碎套子。他说：“开会支差，村干部通知，马上得到，分果实时就看不起来，咱说什么也不顶事。家中没有个水缸，我说要个小水缸，村干部都不许可，吓的我什么东西也不敢提了，我想我是外来户，吃不开。”他父亲接着说：“我在街上听说不久要平分土地，让穷人掌权翻身，我想这一回我能翻透身。”另外还有五户翻身都不够彻底，现在都没有被子盖。发现这问题后，便引上村长、政治主任、合作社长亲自到八户雇贫家实际检查，村干部张着嘴没啥说。黑夜召开村干部会议，检讨是否有雇贫观点，村长、政治主任、合作社长检讨：过去空喊了一冬天走雇贫路线，结果雇贫的困难没解决，自四二年减租运动斗争到现在，现在还有这些雇贫农没有被子盖，证明工作不深入。检讨后，大家决心先解决这几家的眼前的困难。（金水、德全）
