　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Rome dispatch: A wave of demonstrations and strikes has swept across Italy again. According to TASS: Local garrison soldiers in Bologna, Milan, Udine, Rome, and Palermo held demonstrations on the 5th and 6th, protesting the delayed demobilization of soldiers of the 1925 class. The reactionary Italian government, attempting to increase its troop strength by 3,000 soldiers for the purpose of suppressing the people in the upcoming spring elections, therefore adopted this reactionary decision to delay demobilization. The strikes in Italy continue to expand. According to UPI estimates, "200,000 workers are involved, with twelve strikes occurring, and increasingly large and fierce battles are breaking out everywhere with the De Gasperi government." The strike of 100,000 bank employees nationwide, demanding wage increases, is still continuing. Fishermen in the Adriatic Sea, due to unsuccessful negotiations with shipowners for wage increases, have also announced a strike. A general strike has also occurred in Fano (Adriatic coast) to support the demands of unemployed workers and to protest the employers' violation of promises made in negotiations with trade unions.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Milan dispatch: The Sixth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party, which opened on the 5th, is still continuing. When Soviet representative Yudin and Grigory, French Communist leader Thorez, British Communist leader Pollitt, and representatives of the fraternal parties of eight countries attended the meeting, the congress responded with warm cheers. Vittorio, secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, in his report to the congress, emphasized that the achievements of the General Confederation of Labour are mainly due to the Communist Party having become an invincible fortress for the working masses and the victory of New Democracy. Vittorio pointed out that trade unions need to be more united and expressed his belief that the People's Democratic Front will bring a government of working people to Italy. Gregory, the representative from Weilless City, condemned the De Gasperi government for defending U.S. imperialism and called for seeking new ways to expel De Gasperi and the Christian Democrats. Representatives of various fraternal parties paid their respects to the congress and delivered speeches. When French Communist leader Thorez delivered a congratulatory message to the congress and criticized U.S. imperialism for obstructing all economic and political progress, the entire congress stood up, sang the Marseillaise, and paid their respects to him.

　　Also reported: U.S. Communist Party representative Weiss, who was to attend the Italian Communist Party Congress, was prevented from going because the U.S. imperialist authorities refused to issue him a passport. The Central Committee of the U.S. Communist Party has protested to the U.S. State Department. Pieck and Kroetig, leaders of the German Socialist Unity Party, have sent telegrams congratulating the Sixth Congress of the Italian Communist Party and expressing their indignation at the U.S. and British occupation authorities for refusing to issue passports, preventing them from attending the meeting.
