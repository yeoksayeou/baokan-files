Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Moscow Radio broadcast a New Year's commentary by Masinu on the 8th, stating: The Chinese reactionary camp and the Chinese democratic camp welcomed the New Year with two completely different emotions. The reactionaries felt that their situation was completely hopeless and doomed to final failure, and expressed pessimism and disappointment. A Reuters reporter in Nanjing, summarizing his impressions, wrote: Senior officials in Nanjing are deeply convinced that the end of the Kuomintang's life is imminent. In his New Year's broadcast, Chiang Kai-shek admitted that the people supported the Communist Party, that the Kuomintang's "general mobilization" could not be realized, and that he was in crisis. The Chinese democratic camp, on the other hand, was full of confidence in victory due to its growing strength. An American journalist, Rhine, who had recently visited the Liberated Areas, saw this situation and specifically pointed out: Everywhere in the Liberated Areas expressed full confidence in victory. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, said in his report: "The revolutionary war of the Chinese people has now reached a turning point." Masinu continued: The failure of the Chinese reactionary camp's plans and the success of the democratic camp's plans are by no means, as stated in the Reuters Nanjing reporter's dispatch, "one of the main factors is that the current Chinese (Chiang) government has not received significant assistance from the United States." All facts show that since the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang has received and continues to receive significant assistance from the United States government. This assistance has already greatly exceeded 4.4 billion US dollars, and a large number of American weapons and military supplies are constantly and increasingly being transported to the Kuomintang-controlled areas. American military advisors have moved to the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense to work, and many American officers personally participate in the work of the Kuomintang front-line headquarters. They have provided great assistance to the reactionary army's offensive, but the result is still Chiang Kai-shek's miserable failure. Mao Zedong pointed out: The Kuomintang's military superiority and American aid are only temporary factors; while the nature of the war and the will of the people are constant factors, and the People's Liberation Army has an advantage in this regard. The experience of eighteen months of war has fully proved the correctness of this argument. Masinu concluded: This is the reason why the Chinese democratic camp is full of confidence in victory.

### 一个中国两样新年　蒋介石自知必败哭丧悲观解放区人民充满胜利信心

　　一个中国两样新年
  　蒋介石自知必败哭丧悲观解放区人民充满胜利信心
    【新华社陕北十八日电】莫斯科电台八日广播马西努新年评论称：中国反动阵营和中国民主阵营，是怀着完全不同的两种情绪迎接了新年。反动派感到自己所处的景况完全没有出路和必然遭到最后失败，而表示悲观失望。路透社南京记者在总结自己的印象时写道：在南京的高级官员中深信国民党的寿命的终结已经是指日可待了。蒋介石在自己的新年广播中，承认人民拥护共产党，承认国民党的“总动员”不能实现，承认自己处在危机中。而中国民主阵营则对于自己日益强大的力量充满胜利信心。不久以前到过解放区的美国记者莱茵就看到了这种情形，他特别指出：在解放区到处都表示出对于胜利的充分信心。中国共产党主席毛泽东在他的报告中说：“中国人民的革命战争，现在已经达到了一个转折点”。马西努继称：中国反动阵营计划的失败，民主阵营计划的成功，绝非如上述路透社南京记者的通讯所说：“其主要因素之一是现今的中国（蒋）政府没有得到美国的重大援助”。一切事实说明，日本投降以来，国民党已得到和继续得到美国政府重大援助，这种援助过去已大大超过四十万万美元，而美国大批武器与军用物资正不断的日益增加的运往国民党统治区，美国的军事顾问们，都搬到国民党国防部去办公，许多美国军官亲自参加国民党前线司令部的工作。他们已为反动军队的进攻做了很大的援助，但其结果仍然是蒋介石的悲惨失败。毛泽东指出：国民党军事力量的优势、美国的援助，只是临时起作用的因素；而战争的性质，人心的向背，则是经常起作用的因素，人民解放军在这方面则占着优势。十八个月战争的经验，充分证明了这一个论断的正确。马西努末称：中国民主阵营所以充满胜利信心，其原因即在此。
