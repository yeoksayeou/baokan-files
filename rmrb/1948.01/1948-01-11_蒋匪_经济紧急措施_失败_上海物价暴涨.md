Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. According to various sources: After the New Year holiday, various commodity prices in Shanghai have risen again. The price of rice has increased by 400,000 yuan in three or four days since the 2nd. By the 5th, the price per dan (approximately 50 kg) had reached 1.5 million yuan, 150,000 times the price before the War of Resistance. The black market exchange rate for US dollars rose to 165,000 yuan, almost double the official rate of 89,000 yuan. Prices of other goods also rose sharply across the board. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities' "economic emergency measures" have completely failed. Faced with soaring rice prices, Chiang Kai-shek's Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen was helpless and horrified, and hurriedly telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek's government's Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun for assistance. According to various sources, a large number of 5,000 yuan Customs Gold Units (equivalent to 100,000 yuan of Chiang Kai-shek currency) appeared on the market during the New Year holiday, which stimulated price increases. Furthermore, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's Ministry of Food, in cooperation with its bureaucratic banks, the Farmers Bank, massively purchased rice in rice-producing areas such as Wuxi, which is one of the reasons for the recent surge in rice prices.

　　蒋匪“经济紧急措施”失败
  　上海物价暴涨
    【新华社陕北七日电】据各方消息：年假以后，上海各种物价又作新的上涨。米价自二日以来三四日内已上涨四十万元，至五日每担价格已高达一百五十万元，为抗战前的十五万倍。美钞黑市汇价又涨至十六万五千元，较官定市价八万九千元几乎高出一倍，其他各物亦一致急剧上涨。蒋匪当局之“经济紧急措施”完全宣告破产。在米价暴涨下，蒋匪上海市长吴国桢已束手无策惊骇不已，急忙致电蒋匪政府行政院长张群呼吁援助。据各方称：年假期间大量五千元的关金券（合蒋币十万元）出现市场，为刺激物价之原因。而蒋匪粮食部与其官僚银行农民银行合作在产米区芜锡等地大量搜购大米，又为近日米价狂涨原因之一。
