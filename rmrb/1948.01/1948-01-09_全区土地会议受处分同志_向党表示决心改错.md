　　Comrades Punished at the Regional Land Conference
  　Express Determination to Correct Mistakes to the Party
　　[News from this newspaper] At the Regional Land Conference, after investigating class background, ideology, and work style, comrades who were punished by the Party for making mistakes in the past land reform expressed their willingness to humbly accept the punishment. Many comrades wrote letters to the presidium of the conference, saying that they are determined to deeply reflect, correct their mistakes, and serve the people to the end in the future. Li Guanglu said: "Because of my landlord ideology and actions to protect landlords, and unclear economic procedures, the Party decided to expel me from the Party, which I fully agree with. But I am still willing to work under the leadership of the Party and be a more complete proletarian fighter." Wu Sixing also expressed the same sentiment. After Liu Peng was expelled from the Party, he said that this punishment was absolutely necessary, as it was for the sake of the Party's purity and consolidation. He self-critically stated: "I am not weeping for my Party membership being revoked, but only hate my serious mistakes that have harmed my more than seventeen years of political life. This is even more painful than being shot. Today I have lost my mother—the Party, but I will never be discouraged. I believe I have the courage to pick up new weapons and fight against these mistakes, and I will work as a hired laborer for the people until death." The presidium expressed unlimited welcome to their attitude and sent their applications to the Organization Department of the Central Bureau for filing. The Central Bureau believes that the Party has adopted a serious attitude towards the mistakes they have committed and must punish them. However, as long as they are determined to correct their mistakes and honestly serve the people in action, the Party will still embrace them with full enthusiasm and hope, and will definitely help them and give them the opportunity to reform.

　　全区土地会议受处分同志
  　向党表示决心改错
    【本报消息】全区土地会议上，经过查阶级、查思想、查作风后，因过去在土地改革中犯错误而受到党处分的同志，表示虚心接收。不少同志写信给大会主席团，说今后决心深入反省，改正错误，为人民服务到底。李光禄说：“因我地主思想和包庇地主行动，经济手续不清，党决定开除我的党籍，我很同意。但仍愿在党的领导下工作，作一个较完整的无产阶级战士。”吴思行亦有同样表示。刘鹏被开除党籍后，他说这个处分完全必要，这是为了党的纯洁和巩固。他自我检讨道：“我不是痛哭我的党籍被开除，只有痛恨我严重的错误害了我十七年多的政治生命。这比枪毙我还痛心。今天我失掉了母亲——党，但我决不灰心，我相信我有勇气拿起新的武器，和这些错误作斗争，生死要为人民当长工。”主席团，对他们这种态度，表示无限欢迎，当将他们申请书送交中央局组织部归了档案。中央局认为党对他们所犯的错误，是采取严肃的态度，必须予以处分，但只要他们决心改正错误，在行动上老老实实为人民服务，党对他们仍抱有满腔热忱和希望，一定帮助他们，给予改过机会。
