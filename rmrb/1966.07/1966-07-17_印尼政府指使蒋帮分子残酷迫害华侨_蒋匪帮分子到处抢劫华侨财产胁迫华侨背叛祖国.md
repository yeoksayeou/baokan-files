The Indonesian government has become even more brazen in recent two months, utilizing American imperialist lackeys, the Chiang Kai-shek gangsters, to brutally persecute overseas Chinese and politically frame them.

Under the protection and incitement of the Indonesian government and right-wing military, the Chiang Kai-shek gangsters have been extremely arrogant. On the afternoon of June 1, more than ten Chiang Kai-shek gangsters, including He Bingguang, Chen Xinglong, and Lin Genben, from West Java's Maoshan, with the cover of right-wing military, barged into the local overseas Chinese association's meeting to hold an anti-China gathering. Right-wing military officer Xiao Shao Shao first spoke at the meeting, viciously attacking the People's Republic of China. He Bingguang and Lin Genben also spoke, slandering China and expressing their loyalty to the right-wing military regime of Indonesia. After the meeting, the right-wing military and Chiang Kai-shek gangsters feasted together. Chen Xinglong also requested that Xiao Shao Shao use the overseas Chinese association's building as their "Chinese Action Committee" office and "borrow" the overseas Chinese school to establish a Chiang Kai-shek gangster school. On the morning of May 21, a small group of Chiang Kai-shek gangsters in North Sumatra held a "loyalty rally" at the local sports field. After the rally, they marched into the city, specifically attacking and destroying patriotic overseas Chinese shops, tearing down the national flag of the People's Republic of China, and looting overseas Chinese property. Local military and police turned a blind eye to the gangsters' atrocities, causing severe losses to patriotic overseas Chinese shops.

The Indonesian government uses the Chiang Kai-shek gangsters as henchmen to close and seize overseas Chinese organizations and schools. On April 21, the military government and right-wing thugs in North Sulawesi's Manado, along with local Chiang Kai-shek gangsters, boarded more than ten trucks to "take over" the Chinese primary school and overseas Chinese high school, as well as the Manado Overseas Chinese Association, Hainanese Association, and Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Association. Over a thousand overseas Chinese primary school students and more than four hundred high school students were forced to drop out, and dozens of overseas Chinese teachers lost their jobs. Under the orders of the right-wing government, the Chiang Kai-shek gangsters in Medan, North Sumatra, also established a secret reactionary organization called the "Crush the Agents of the People's Republic of China United Action Organization" to serve as the right-wing military regime's henchmen, specifically engaging in the evil deeds of harming patriotic overseas Chinese.

Under the instigation of the right-wing government, the Chiang Kai-shek gangsters in various parts of Indonesia also threaten overseas Chinese to participate in anti-China rallies and parades, threaten them to betray their motherland and "loyalty" to Suharto, and politically frame them to serve the Indonesian government's anti-China conspiracy. The Chiang Kai-shek spy gangsters in Medan, North Sumatra, including Zhang Shaofan, who had long worked at the American consulate in Medan, and other Chiang Kai-shek gangsters, held an anti-China rally and parade on May 7 and attacked the Chinese consulate in Medan. In East Java's Gresik, the right-wing military of Indonesia convened a meeting of representatives from the overseas Chinese associations of Gresik and Mojokerto counties on May 2. The Gresik garrison commander read a so-called "condemnation" statement drafted by the local Chiang Kai-shek gangster Cai Yunhui, accusing the Chinese government of "interfering" in Indonesian internal affairs and the Beijing radio station of "slandering" the Indonesian army. They demanded that the representatives of the overseas Chinese associations sign the statement, which was firmly rejected by the representatives. The Chiang Kai-shek gangsters in Jakarta frequently publicly threaten overseas Chinese to be "loyal" to Suharto and "fully assist the armed forces of the Republic of Indonesia"; they even follow the right-wing of Indonesia shouting to send overseas Chinese preparing to return to the mainland to Taiwan.

Since last October, the Chiang Kai-shek gangsters hiding in Indonesia have emerged one after another. Those who were previously expelled by the former Indonesian government have also returned to Indonesia one after another. Under the indulgence and orders of the Indonesian government, these Chiang Kai-shek gangsters have recently strengthened their contact with the Chiang Kai-shek gangsters in Taiwan. For example, the Chiang Kai-shek gangsters in Medan, including Fu Hebing, have gone to Hong Kong and then to Taiwan to make contact.

　　印尼政府指使蒋帮分子残酷迫害华侨
　　蒋匪帮分子到处抢劫华侨财产胁迫华侨背叛祖国
    新华社十六日讯　最近两个多月来，印度尼西亚政府更加明目张胆地利用美帝国主义走狗蒋匪帮分子残酷迫害华侨，并对华侨进行政治陷害。
    在印度尼西亚政府和右派军人的庇护、怂恿下，蒋匪帮分子气焰十分嚣张。六月一日下午，西爪哇茂物的蒋匪帮分子何炳光、陈兴隆、林根本等十多人，在印度尼西亚右派军人的掩护下，闯进当地侨团华侨公会开反华会议。右派军人摩莫少校首先在会上讲话，大肆攻击中华人民共和国。何炳光、林根本等也发言污蔑中国，并表示效忠印度尼西亚右派军人政权。会后，右派军人和蒋匪帮分子一起大吃大喝。蒋匪帮分子陈兴隆并向摩莫少校要求把华侨公会会所作为他们的
  “华人行动委员会”的办事处，还要“借”华侨公学开办蒋帮学校。五月二十一日上午九时，北苏门答腊地区一小撮蒋匪帮分子在当地运动广场举行“效忠大会”。散会后，他们游行进入市区，专门袭击和破坏爱国华侨的商店，撕毁中华人民共和国国旗，抢劫华侨财产。当地军警对蒋匪帮分子的这种暴行视若无睹，使爱国华侨的商店遭受到严重损失。
    印度尼西亚政府利用蒋匪帮分子作为封闭和强占华侨团体、华侨学校的打手。四月二十一日，北苏拉威西万鸦佬的军政当局和右派暴徒，伙同当地的蒋匪帮分子，分乘十多辆卡车，前往“接管”中华小学和华侨中学，以及万鸦佬华侨总会、琼崖同乡会、华侨互助会等华侨团体，使一千多名华侨小学生和四百多名中学生失学，几十名华侨教师失业。在右派当局的指使下，北苏门答腊棉兰的蒋匪帮分子还成立了所谓“粉碎中华人民共和国走卒统一行动机构”的秘密反动组织，作为印度尼西亚右派军人政权的爪牙，专门从事暗害爱国华侨的罪恶勾当。
    在右派当局的怂恿下，蒋匪帮分子还在印度尼西亚各地威胁华侨参加反华集会和游行，威胁华侨背叛祖国，“效忠”苏哈托，并对华侨进行政治陷害，为印度尼西亚政府的反华阴谋效劳。北苏门答腊棉兰的蒋匪帮特务分子、长期在美国驻棉兰领事馆工作的曾少藩以及其他蒋匪帮分子，在五月七日举行了反华集会和游行，并且袭击了中国驻棉兰领事馆。在东爪哇的柬议里，印度尼西亚右派军人在五月二日召集柬议里和茉莉芬两州县的华侨总会代表开会，柬议里卫戍司令在会上宣读了当地蒋匪帮分子蔡云辉草拟的所谓“谴责”中国政府“干涉”印度尼西亚内政和北京电台“诽谤”印度尼西亚陆军的“声明”，并要华侨总会代表在声明上签字，遭到华侨总会代表的严正拒绝。雅加达的蒋匪帮分子，经常公开出面胁迫华侨“效忠”苏哈托，“全力协助印度尼西亚共和国武装部队”；甚至跟着印度尼西亚右派叫喊要把准备回国的华侨送到台湾去。
    从去年十月以来，潜伏在印度尼西亚的蒋匪帮分子纷纷出笼。过去曾经被前印度尼西亚政府驱逐出境的蒋匪帮分子也陆续回到印度尼西亚。在印度尼西亚政府的纵容和指使下，这些蒋匪帮分子最近加强了与台湾蒋匪帮的联系，如棉兰的蒋匪帮分子符和炳等就曾前往香港转赴台湾进行联系。
