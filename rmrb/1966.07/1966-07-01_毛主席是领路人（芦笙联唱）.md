	Chairman Mao is the Guide
	(Lusong Ensemble) In Mengla County, Xishuangbanna, those who can play the lusong will play, and those who cannot play the lusong will sing. The Communist Party is like the red sun, shining its light over the land. With determination to be self-reliant, the frontier's face changes daily. The revolutionary spirit will forever be upheld. Chairman Mao is the guide. The collective power is boundless, able to manage the earth and the sky. Learn from Dazhai and catch up with Dazhai, turning barren mountains into gardens. The sunlight warms the hearts of people, adding vigor and enthusiasm. The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is held high, the mountains laugh and the waters rejoice!

    毛主席是领路人
    （芦笙联唱）西双版纳勐腊县小田坝俱乐部会跳笙的来跳笙，不会跳笙的来歌唱。共产党象红太阳，阳光普照大地上。自力更生有决心，边疆面貌日日新。革命精神永发扬，毛主席是领路人。集体力量大无边，能管地来能管天。学习大寨赶大寨，要把荒山变园田。阳光照得人心暖，意气风发干劲添。毛泽东思想红旗高高举，山也笑来水也欢！
