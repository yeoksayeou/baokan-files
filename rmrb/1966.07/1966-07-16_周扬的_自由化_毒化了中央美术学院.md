    **Raise High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought**
    **Open Fire on the Literary and Artistic Black Line Led by Zhou Yang**
    **— Selection of Big-Character Posters —**

    **Editor's Note:** Today, our newspaper publishes several more big-character posters exposing the ugly face of Zhou Yang's anti-party and anti-socialist activities. From these posters, we once again see that Zhou Yang, the ringleader of the literary and artistic black line, is truly a man of heinous crimes and boundless evil.

    Zhou Yang's tentacles reach too far. Whenever he gets the chance, he spreads poison everywhere. He uses his authority to issue orders, preventing the masses from promoting Mao Zedong Thought in cultural work stations and halls. He attempts to seize control of the rural cultural front, using ghost plays and performances of emperors, generals, and romantic tales to numb the minds of laboring peasants. Under the pretext of learning "culture" and gaining "knowledge," he lures young peasants away from politics and prevents them from studying Chairman Mao's works.

    Zhou Yang has long held onto the theater as his stronghold. He brazenly opposes theater reform and the performance of revolutionary modern plays, allowing god plays, ghost plays, foreign plays, and ancient plays—all sorts of trash—to flood the theater stages, making our theater world a mess.

    Wherever Zhou Yang's tentacles reach, the demons and monsters there applaud and peddle feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism.

    Zhou Yang's activities in the cultural and artistic world are the most widespread, and his poisonous influence is profound. Now that we have caught him, we must thoroughly criticize and expose him.

    **"Revolutionary big-character posters are the magic mirrors that expose all demons and monsters."** The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary literary and artistic workers must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and make full use of this powerful weapon of revolutionary big-character posters to sweep away the black gang of Zhou Yang and all demons and monsters.

    For a long time, Zhou Yang and other agents of the bourgeoisie within the party, who have usurped the leadership of the literary and artistic world, have consistently refused to implement the literary and artistic line of Mao Zedong. They stubbornly adhere to and promote the bourgeois, revisionist literary and artistic black line.

    In 1956, at the expanded meeting of the Secretariat of the Chinese Artists Association, Zhou Yang vigorously denied the existence of class struggle in socialist society. He then proposed a bourgeois liberalization plan that opposed proletarian literature and art. He advocated "free competition," saying that "politics should not be understood too narrowly" and that "it is not only by painting workers, peasants, and soldiers that one can serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. This view not only narrows the scope of art but also narrows the scope of politics."

    In 1959, at the national cultural work conference, Zhou Yang's speech closely aligned with the right-opportunist attack on the party, firing another poisonous arrow. In this report, he repeated his old revisionist tune, proposing the slogan of "literature and art for all the people" and further demanding that our plays become "common plays of the world." Zhou Yang's advocacy of "literature and art for all the people" was nothing but a copy of the "world art" proposed by Western bourgeoisie.

    Zhou Yang shamelessly echoed modern revisionism, advocating "personal happiness" as the highest ideal, and further promoting the theme of "love and death" in literature and art, claiming it to be an "eternal theme." Zhou Yang praised the descriptions of love above all and the promotion of bourgeois individualism in "La Traviata" and "The Legend of the White Snake" as "loyalty and self-sacrifice." In contrast, he slandered our literature as "hypocritical" and proposed the reactionary theory of "writing the truth."

    In 1962, when an anti-China chorus emerged internationally and a black wind of anti-party and anti-socialism blew domestically, Zhou Yang's black gang hastily put forward a thoroughly revisionist literary and artistic program. They deliberately distorted the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," criticizing some party cadres for being rude and arbitrary, self-righteous, and obstructing the "free discussion" of art. They also said, "The needs of cultural life are diverse.... As long as it can 'broaden the horizons of the people,' 'improve the aesthetic and appreciation level of the people,' it is for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, it is for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and for socialism."

    After Zhou Yang and his gang put forward this thoroughly revisionist literary and artistic program, the literary and artistic world showed a tendency toward bourgeois liberalization. In the art academy, various bourgeois and feudal arts flourished, and past poisonous weeds were all hailed as fresh flowers. In the printmaking studio, Matisse and Picasso's Fauvist art was openly peddled. Outside the studio, small salons were established, taking the decadent bourgeois art of the 20th century as their model. Under the guidance of Zhou Yang and others, who advocated "stabilizing the teaching order," the entire set of bourgeois teaching directions, systems, content, and methods could not be changed. They implemented bourgeois dictatorship over the Central Academy of Fine Arts.

    It was under the influence of this revisionist literary and artistic line that the academic committee of the art academy concentrated a large number of demons and monsters. In the printmaking department, the studio system was fully implemented, and within the studio, everything was decided by the "experts" and "authorities." From top to bottom, party leadership was excluded, realizing what the rightists had failed to achieve—the professors' rule over the school. No wonder some bourgeois experts joyfully exclaimed, "Excellent! A monument should be erected, and it should never be changed again!" Now the facts are clear, and the evidence is irrefutable. No matter how cunning and treacherous Zhou Yang, the chameleon, is, he cannot escape the judgment of the revolutionary people.

    Zhou Yang also attempted to turn various associations into Petőfi Clubs, eliminating party leadership. He once proposed that the Chinese Artists Association should be an "independent organization" that excludes party leadership, with the leadership structure consisting of the Communist Party as only one side and non-party members making up more than half. This is a thoroughly anti-party, right-wing statement of the bourgeoisie.

    We must thoroughly overthrow the literary and artistic black line and black gang led by Zhou Yang, who are anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, and completely eliminate the influence of Zhou Yang's revisionist black line in the literary and artistic world, carrying the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
　　向周扬为首的文艺黑线开火
　　——大字报选——
    编者按：今天本报又发表几篇揭露周扬反党反社会主义丑恶面目的大字报。从这些大字报中，我们再一次看到，周扬这个文艺界黑线的总头目，真是罪行累累，恶贯满盈。
    周扬的魔爪伸得太长了，只要一有机会，他就到处放毒。他利用职权发号施令，不让群众文化工作馆、站宣传毛泽东思想。他妄图霸占农村文化阵地，用演鬼戏，演帝王将相、才子佳人等坏戏，麻痹劳动农民的思想。他借口学“文化”、长“知识”，引诱青年农民脱离政治，不去学习毛主席著作。
    周扬的魔爪长期抓住戏曲这个阵地不放。他猖狂反对戏曲改革，反对演革命现代戏，使神戏、鬼戏、洋戏、古戏等乌七八糟的东西，充满戏曲舞台，把我们的戏曲界搞得不象个样子。
    周扬的魔爪伸到哪个艺术院校，那里的牛鬼蛇神就拍手称道，大肆贩卖封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的黑货。
    周扬在文化艺术界的活动最广，遗毒特多，为害非浅。我们现在把他抓住了，非把他彻底批垮、斗臭不可。
    “革命的大字报是暴露一切牛鬼蛇神的照妖镜”。广大的工农兵群众、革命干部、革命的文艺工作者，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更充分运用革命的大字报这个有力武器，横扫周扬一伙黑帮，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。
　　周扬的“自由化”毒化了中央美术学院
　　中央美术学院版画系革命师生
    长期以来，窃取文艺界领导权的周扬等党内资产阶级代理人，始终拒绝执行毛泽东同志的文艺路线，顽固地坚持和推行资产阶级、修正主义的文艺黑线。
    一九五六年，周扬在美术家协会秘书长扩大会议上，极力否认社会主义社会有阶级斗争。接着就抛出一个与无产阶级文艺相对抗的资产阶级自由化方案。他鼓吹要“放手自由竞赛”，说什么“不要把政治理解得太狭隘”，“不是只画工农兵才能为工农兵服务，这种观点不但把艺术看得太狭隘，也把政治看得太狭隘。”
    一九五九年，周扬在全国文化工作会议上的讲话，紧密地配合右倾机会主义的进攻，向党发出了又一支毒箭。在这个报告里，重弹了他的修正主义老调，提出“全民文艺”的口号，进而要求我们的“剧目成为世界的共同剧目”。原来周扬提倡的“全民文艺”，只不过是西方资产阶级提出的“世界艺术”的翻版而已。
    周扬还恬不知耻地与现代修正主义一唱一和，把“个人幸福”作为最高的理想，并进一步提倡文艺要描写“爱和死”的主题，胡说这是“永恒的主题”。周扬把描写爱情至上、宣扬资产阶级个人主义的《茶花女》和《白蛇传》，吹捧为“坚贞不二，自我牺牲的精神”。反过来又诬蔑我们的文学是“虚伪”的，提出“写真实”的反动理论。
    一九六二年，国际上出现了反华大合唱，国内刮起一股反党、反社会主义的黑风。这时，周扬一伙黑帮也急急忙忙抛出了一个彻头彻尾的修正主义文艺纲领，极力歪曲“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，责备某些党员干部简单粗暴，独断独行，自以为是，妨碍了艺术的“自由探讨”。又说“对文化生活上的需要，是多种多样的。……”只要能“扩大人民的眼界”，“提高人民的审美能力和欣赏水平，都是为工农兵所需要，都是为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务的”。
    在周扬等一伙提出了这个彻头彻尾的修正主义文艺纲领之后，文艺界出现了资产阶级自由化的倾向。在美术学院，形形色色的资产阶级、封建阶级艺术大泛滥，过去不敢拿出来的毒草，统统奉为鲜花。在版画系画室中，公开贩卖马蒂斯、毕加索的野兽派艺术。在画室外又成立小沙龙，以二十世纪没落的资产阶级艺术为追求的榜样。一整套资产阶级的教学方向，教学体制，教学内容，教学方法，在周扬等提出“稳定教学秩序”的指示下，一点也不能更改。他们对中央美术学院，实行了资产阶级专政。
    正是在这条修正主义文艺路线的影响下，美术学院院务委员会集中了大批牛鬼蛇神。在版画系全面推行了画室制，在画室里完全由“专家、权威”说了算，上上下下都排除了党的领导，实现了右派分子所未能实现的教授治校。难怪有的资产阶级专家兴高采烈地欢呼：“好极了！应该立个碑，以后再不要变了！”现在事实俱在，铁证如山，不管周扬这个变色龙多么阴险狡猾，也逃脱不了革命人民对你的审判。
    周扬还企图使各协会变为裴多菲俱乐部，取消党的领导。他曾经倡议美协应该是排斥党的领导的“独立性的组织”，领导机构中，共产党只能作为一个方面参加，非党人士必须超过半数。这是彻头彻尾反对党的领导的资产阶级右派言论。
    我们一定要把以周扬为首的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的文艺黑线和文艺黑帮统统打倒，彻底清除周扬的修正主义黑线在文艺界的影响，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
