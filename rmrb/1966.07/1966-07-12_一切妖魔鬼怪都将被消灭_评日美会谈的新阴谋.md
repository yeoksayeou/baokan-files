All monsters and demons will be annihilated
—Commenting on the New Conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan Talks

The U.S. Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, personally led the recent talks with the Sato government in Japan. This is a new conspiracy of American imperialism. Its purpose is to tighten the collusion with Japanese reactionaries, plot the expansion of the Vietnam War, forge a new aggressive military alliance in Asia, and further unite with the Soviet revisionist leadership to oppose China and the peoples of Asia.

The Johnson administration brazenly bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the second-largest city, Haiphong, playing the trick of "bombing for peace." Not only did this not improve its predicament in the Vietnam War, but it also provoked the strongest protests from people around the world and sparked even more resolute and courageous resistance from the Vietnamese people. The situation in the Vietnam War is increasingly unfavorable for the United States. It is precisely under these circumstances that Rusk hurried to Japan, attempting to make the Japanese reactionaries further serve its continued expansion of the Vietnam War.

In this round of U.S.-Japan talks, the Sato government fully exposed its hideous face as a lackey of American imperialism. The U.S. imperialist bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, and its further expansion of the Vietnam War, has aroused the indignation of people worldwide and has been strongly condemned by global public opinion. Yet, the Sato government dared to defy the world's outrage and publicly expressed support for the Johnson administration. Thus, the Sato government once again placed itself in a position of enmity with the Vietnamese people and the peoples of Asia.

Another content of the U.S.-Japan talks is to gather all the servants, puppets, and lackeys of American imperialism in Asia and the Pacific region to establish an aggressive military alliance in the Asia-Pacific region with Japan as the core, directing its spearhead towards socialist China, Korea, and Vietnam, and towards the peoples of various Asian countries. In this conspiracy, the Soviet revisionist leadership is by no means an outsider. Listen to this: Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu spoke at length about the so-called "successes" of "Japan-Soviet friendly diplomacy"; Rusk also praised Japan's collusion with the Soviet revisionist leadership and advocated that the basic line of U.S.-Soviet cooperation would not change. The facts are clear: American imperialism and Japanese reactionaries are tightening their collusion with the Soviet revisionist leadership, attempting to strengthen the encirclement of China to oppose the Chinese people and suppress the revolutionary movements of the peoples of Asia.

Today, American imperialism in Vietnam and Asia appears to be still ferocious and aggressive, crazily launching counterattacks and struggles. However, whether it is American imperialism or its servants and lackeys, they cannot stop the anti-imperialist revolutionary tide of the Asian peoples. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The people of the whole world must have courage, dare to fight, not be afraid of difficulties, and go forward unyieldingly. In that case, the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All devils will be annihilated." This is no exception in Asia. The flames of the anti-imperialist revolution of the Asian peoples will eventually reduce the American aggressors and all reactionary forces to ashes. Asia belongs to the awakened, fighting peoples of Asia.

　　一切妖魔鬼怪都将被消灭
　　——评日美会谈的新阴谋
　　本报评论员
    美国国务卿腊斯克亲自出马，最近到日本同佐藤政府举行了会谈。这是美帝国主义的一个新阴谋。其目的在加紧勾结日本反动派，策划扩大侵越战争，在亚洲拼凑新的侵略性的军事同盟，并且进一步联合苏联修正主义领导集团，以反对中国、反对亚洲人民。
    约翰逊政府悍然轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内和第二大城市海防，玩弄“以炸迫和”的把戏，不但没有改善它在侵越战争中的困境，反而遭到了全世界人民最强烈的抗议，激起了全越南人民更加坚决英勇的抵抗。侵越战争的形势对美国越来越不利。正是在这样的情况下，腊斯克匆匆跑到日本，企图使日本反动派为它继续扩大侵越战争进一步效劳。
    在这次日美会谈中，佐藤政府充分暴露了它作为美帝国主义帮凶的狰狞面目。美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防、进一步扩大侵越战争的罪行，激起了全世界人民的公愤，遭到全世界舆论的强烈谴责。而佐藤政府竟然敢于冒天下之大不韪，公开表示支持约翰逊政府。这样，佐藤政府就又一次把自己置于同越南人民和亚洲人民为敌的地位。
    日美会谈的另一个内容，是要把美帝国主义在亚洲和太平洋地区的一切仆从、傀儡和走狗，搜罗在一起，建立一个以日本为核心的侵略性的亚洲太平洋地区军事同盟，把矛头指向社会主义的中国、朝鲜和越南，指向亚洲各国人民。在这一阴谋活动中，苏联修正主义领导集团决非是局外人。请听：日本外务大臣椎名在会上大谈所谓“日苏亲善外交”的“成果”；腊斯克也赞许日本勾结苏联修正主义领导集团的作法，并且宣扬美苏合作的基本路线不会变化。事实十分明显，美帝国主义和日本反动派正在加紧勾结苏联修正主义领导集团，妄图加强对中国的包围圈，来反对中国人民，并镇压亚洲人民的革命运动。
    今天，美帝国主义在越南，在亚洲，表面上还是气势汹汹，张牙舞爪，疯狂地进行反扑和挣扎。但是，不管是美帝国主义也罢，或者再加上它的仆从和帮凶也罢，都阻挡不住亚洲人民反帝革命的洪流。毛主席指出：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”这在亚洲也绝不例外。亚洲人民反帝革命的烈火，终将把美国侵略者和一切反动势力烧成灰烬。亚洲属于觉醒的、战斗的亚洲人民。
