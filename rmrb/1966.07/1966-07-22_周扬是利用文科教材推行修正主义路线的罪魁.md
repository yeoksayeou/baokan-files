Zhou Yang is a thoroughgoing revisionist. He is not only the "patriarch" of promoting the revisionist line in the literary and artistic circles but also the chief culprit of opposing Mao Zedong Thought in the humanities departments of colleges and universities and promoting the revisionist line.

In the latter half of 1960, Zhou Yang extended his black hand into the humanities departments of colleges and universities. At that time, it was the moment when domestic and foreign reactionaries joined forces to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, on socialism, and on the great Mao Zedong Thought. Zhou Yang understood that the humanities departments of colleges and universities train personnel in the ideological field, and many of them will eventually control the superstructure of the state. Moreover, a large number of "authorities" and "experts" in the field of philosophy and social sciences had already gathered there, and they were Zhou Yang's main reliance for spreading feudal, capitalist, and revisionist thoughts. Zhou Yang wanted to prepare public opinion and personnel for the restoration of capitalism in China. The humanities departments of colleges and universities were an important battlefield that he must control. He said: "I hope for the youth, the work relies on the old." This means that he wanted to rely on a group of feudal remnants, anti-communist experts, and bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities" to cultivate the younger generation into the successors of the bourgeoisie. These two sentences fully reveal the wolfish ambition of Zhou Yang, the leader of the counter-revolutionary gang.

As soon as Zhou Yang set foot on the base of university humanities, the first thing he did was to launch a ferocious counterattack and revenge against the educational revolution of 1958 and the criticism of bourgeois academic thought by the proletariat. In October 1960, he distorted the revolutionary slogan of the historical field, "guiding history with theory," into "replacing history with theory," and launched a vicious attack, firing the first shot for the bourgeois counterattack and revenge. In February 1961, he first proposed the slogan of "no destruction without construction" in Shanghai, opposing the educational revolution. Then, in April of the same year, he presided over the National Conference on the Planning of Humanities Textbooks for Colleges and Universities, putting forward a systematic and comprehensive revisionist educational line. From then on, for the past five or six years, he has been tirelessly promoting this line, recruiting and enlisting followers, and actively implementing this line, vigorously opposing the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought.

The heinous crimes committed by Zhou Yang in taking advantage of his leadership in the construction of humanities textbooks must be thoroughly exposed.

Zhou Yang proposed a set of revisionist policies for humanities education.

Zhou Yang's political ambition to control the humanities departments of colleges and universities is concentrated in the following words he often said: "Through textbook construction, cultivate talents and develop academic studies."

By "cultivating talents," Zhou Yang meant cultivating bourgeois spiritual aristocrats who are only specialized but not red.

In his speech at the National Conference on the Planning of Humanities Textbooks for Colleges and Universities in April 1961, and in the "teaching plans" for the seven majors of humanities that he personally presided over, Zhou Yang put forward a thoroughly revisionist line against Mao Zedong Thought for humanities education.

Zhou Yang directed his attacks at the educational policy personally formulated by Chairman Mao: "Our educational policy should enable the educated to develop in moral, intellectual, and physical education and become socially conscious, cultured laborers."

Zhou Yang was particularly resentful of the need to cultivate "laborers." He maliciously distorted the meaning, saying: "Ordinary laborers refer to an attitude and a style, not really letting college graduates become 'ordinary laborers.' What nonsense! Zhou Yang's intention was that college graduates, first, should not be 'ordinary' but special; second, should not be 'laborers' but spiritual aristocrats who stand above the laboring people. Therefore, he believed that the training goal of the humanities departments of colleges and universities should be "teaching and research talents." This means that college graduates can only become "professors" and "researchers" and cannot become workers, peasants, or soldiers.

Zhou Yang also opposed the Party's educational policy, which emphasizes the need to cultivate new people with socialist consciousness. He blatantly proposed: "Do not demand too much redness from university students," "Do not require university graduates to all become Marxists... become political activists." In terms of professional skills, he advocated strict so-called "training" in "basic theory, basic knowledge, and basic skills." He repeatedly claimed that people with backward thoughts can also "serve" socialism. He said: "Let those with backward thoughts study archaeology. Are you afraid they will steal and sell antiques?" It is clear that Zhou Yang was advocating the cultivation of bourgeois spiritual aristocrats who are only specialized but not red.

Starting from this goal, Zhou Yang put forward a set of revisionist policies for a series of related issues in humanities education:

Regarding the relationship between redness and expertise, politics and professional skills, he consistently opposed emphasizing proletarian politics and Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead. He attacked our learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought as "simplification and vulgarization," slandering that now schools are "politics occupying everything," Mao Zedong Thought "replacing everything"; it is supposed to replace generals with commanders, souls with bodies, turning the "red line" into "red cloth," politics "hindering professional learning," and so on. He also cursed "too much politics" would "kill people," "politics all day long, where can there be so much politics." He also wanted people to learn from Confucius, saying that Confucius thousands of years ago "did not hang his worldview on his mouth, he was very clever, his political leadership was integrated into his professional skills...".

Regarding the relationship between living knowledge and book knowledge, Zhou Yang consistently emphasized "studying in seclusion." He advocated filling students' minds with a lot of useless book knowledge, making them more stupid and more superstitious about ancient and foreign people, losing interest in real political struggles, looking down on the laboring people, and not wanting to engage in manual labor.

Regarding the relationship between theory and history, he fiercely attacked guiding academic research with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, attacking learning and applying revolutionary theory as "empty talk," "using ready-made formulas to fit everywhere," "sticking labels randomly."

Regarding the relationship between ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, Zhou Yang deliberately promoted the idea that ancient history is longer than modern history, and the ratio of teaching time for ancient history to modern history is "three to one is still too little." He also proposed: "The method of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, is a comprehensive historical perspective. Without the ancient, there is no historical perspective; without the foreign, there is no comprehensive perspective." Zhou Yang vigorously spread the thoughts of revering the past and foreign countries to oppose the principles of emphasizing the present and using the past for the present.

Regarding the relationship between literature and morality, Zhou Yang cursed: "Now the relationship between literature and morality is absolutized," he slandered that school ideological education is "thinking without learning, discussing without learning, theorizing without learning," turning literature into a carrier of morality, developing it into morality replacing literature, turning language textbooks into political course textbooks, and so on. He opposed teaching proletarian revolutionary principles, Marxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought in teaching materials.

Zhou Yang talked about so many "relationships," but in reality, he did not want Mao Zedong Thought to take the lead but wanted bourgeois "professional skills" to take the lead; it was not about emphasizing proletarian politics but about emphasizing bourgeois politics. His purpose was only one: to use the revisionist educational line to oppose Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's educational policy. Students trained according to Zhou Yang's set of policies could only be bourgeois intellectuals who are only specialized but not red, who only read books but do not labor. Such students have their minds filled with big, foreign, and ancient things, filled with the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. They could not be the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause but would inevitably be the successors of the bourgeoisie.

Zhou Yang's humanities textbooks are weeds that spread feudalism and capitalism.

Once Zhou Yang's claws reached into the battlefield of humanities textbooks for colleges and universities, he sentenced several hundred humanities textbooks edited by the broad masses of teachers and students during the educational revolution of 1958 to "death," mainly on the charge of "low level." He said: "Due to the excessive denial of old heritage and old experts, the young people's knowledge preparation was very insufficient, plus the tendency of exaggeration at that time, these textbooks generally had low levels and could not continue to be adopted." This is the evidence of Zhou Yang's ferocious counterattack against the educational revolution. Towards feudalism and capitalism, Zhou Yang once shouted loudly, advocating "no construction without destruction"; but at the same time, towards the new things produced in the socialist revolution, he wielded a big stick, "destroying first and then saying," killing everything with one stick. All revolutionary teachers and students could not help but feel extremely indignant about this.

After Zhou Yang strangled the new things in the cradle, he immediately revealed his so-called plan for the compilation of humanities textbooks for colleges and universities. This plan included a total of 273 projects, of which 80% were selections and reference materials of feudal and capitalist heritage. This was a blatant attempt to stuff students with a lot of ancient and foreign poisonous things, opposing the arming of students' minds with Mao Zedong Thought. This was an important measure of Zhou Yang's implementation of the "peaceful evolution" policy.

Zhou Yang put forward three requirements for the quality of humanities textbooks: first, the viewpoint should be "basically stable"; second, the materials should be "rich and reliable"; third, the language should be "vivid and concise." What was Zhou Yang's intention in proposing these three requirements? Look at his confession: "Using Marxist ready-made conclusions as clichés, empty talk, and sticking labels randomly cannot play the role of textbooks in transmitting knowledge, and first of all, it is anti-Marxist.... It is not necessary to require every textbook to have a complete Marxist-Leninist viewpoint. Forced requirements can only promote the tendency of vulgarization and simplification." It is very clear that the main purpose of his three "requirements" is to oppose using Marxist-Leninist viewpoints to guide materials and oppose Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead.

Under Zhou Yang's control, a large number of things that beautify feudalism and capitalism, anti-Marxist-Leninist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought emerged. As soon as these things emerged, they quickly encountered opposition and criticism from the broad masses of teachers and students in colleges and universities and readers in society. Zhou Yang stubbornly rejected criticism, sent people to "resist the wind," and notified various newspapers and periodicals not to publish book reviews for most of the trial humanities textbooks. He himself went everywhere to propagandize that the quality of this batch of textbooks was "generally better than the self-edited ones of various schools in the past."

Zhou Yang's denigration and negation of the collective editing of textbooks by revolutionary teachers and students aimed to negate the educational revolution of 1958 from the textbooks and give the bourgeois "scholars" a public and legal position to spread the poison of feudalism and capitalism.

Zhou Yang attempted to develop bourgeois "academic studies" through the compilation of humanities textbooks. His action program was: "Through textbook construction, cultivate talents and develop academic studies." He often propagandized that the construction of humanities textbooks was not only a basic construction of colleges and universities but also an important "academic construction," "ideological construction," "theoretical construction," a "century-long project," and a "long-term cause." He expressed his determination to "endure hardships and taste gall," sharing life and death with textbook construction.

The so-called "academic construction" that Zhou Yang attempted to build was a genuine bourgeois product.

His so-called "academic construction" was to use bourgeois ideology to replace proletarian ideology, to promote the bourgeois and eliminate the proletarian.

A review of Zhou Yang's speeches at the humanities textbook conferences shows that his so-called "academic construction" roughly includes the following contents: first, "accumulating knowledge"; second, "summarizing laws"; third, "forming schools." He always talked about "knowledge" but not politics; only talked about "accumulation" but not criticism; only talked about "construction" but not revolution.

First, let's look at his so-called "accumulating knowledge."

Zhou Yang slandered that in terms of knowledge preparation, the present generation was "one generation worse than the previous one." On May 24, 1961, at a meeting of the aesthetics group, he once said: "Our generation does not have as much preparation (knowledge) as Liang Qichao and Hu Shi.... You read even less than us, that is one generation worse than the previous one." This was a blatant boost to the prestige of bourgeois reactionary "scholars" and a suppression of the spirit of the proletariat. This was an attempt to mold the young generation of the proletariat according to the pattern of feudal conservatives and imperialist running dogs. This was absolutely impossible.

Where should one seek knowledge? Zhou Yang never forgot the "warehouse" in the backyard of the "Confucian shop," the "Japanese showcase" of the Meiji Restoration era, and the "translation bureau" of Peter the Great's era in Russia. He said: The slogan of "overthrowing the Confucian shop" proposed during the May Fourth era was too "one-sided," "do not forget that the Confucian shop has a very large warehouse in the backyard, where there are several thousand years of Chinese cultural heritage"; the "Japanese showcase" of the Meiji Restoration era had "everything"; Peter the Great of Russia "did not have much of his own creation, but he could absorb other people's things," "quickly obtained foreign materials." Zhou Yang also advocated that young people should dare to "explore," go to "check archives," "check three generations," and achieve the fusion of "ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign." This was the "knowledge" that Zhou Yang wanted to "accumulate" and the way to seek knowledge.

Chairman Mao has always taught us that knowledge comes from practice, and the humanities must take society as a factory. Humanities students must go to the three great revolutionary movements, learn from workers and peasants, and increase their knowledge and abilities. Zhou Yang opposed these instructions of Chairman Mao. His approach was to lead young people into the pile of old papers, thus deviating from the revolutionary track of the proletariat.

Next, let's look at Zhou Yang's so-called "summarizing laws."

Zhou Yang opposed the class nature of Marxism-Leninism theory and emphasized "common things of humanity," "common laws," and "commonality." He said: "To have good food and love, one cannot deny that these are the needs of all humanity"; "the spirit of self-sacrifice is necessary to maintain collective life, and all classes advocate it, and bourgeois individualism also talks about their love." He believed that Wang Fuzhi's proposal of "right and wrong, merit and demerit" could be used as a "common standard" for evaluating historical figures; Xunzi's proposal of teaching and learning from each other was the "common law" of education for all classes; "a certain color, a certain line, a certain sound, would give people a sense of beauty," meaning that this was the "common" aesthetic standard of all classes. He also said: "Pull out a tuft of hair and ask if it has class nature.... One cannot say that everything a landlord says has class nature. The class nature of people's thoughts and feelings is not always there; otherwise, people cannot live." This was a ferocious attack on Chairman Mao's theory of class and class struggle.

Zhou Yang opposed the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and only talked about "special laws" and "individuality." Zhou Yang tried every means to make people find "special laws." He said: "Political leadership, mass line, theory linked with practice, etc., are general principles, and there must be special principles."

What were the special principles he talked about?

When talking about the Party's leadership, Zhou Yang emphasized professional leadership. He said: "Now some people emphasize outsiders leading insiders, but do not emphasize turning outsiders into insiders, as if the more outsiders the better. This encourages general work, replacing the special with the general." This was actually opposing political leadership over professional work and opposing the Party's leadership.

Zhou Yang also emphasized the so-called "characteristics of imagery thinking." He said: "Imagery thinking is thinking according to the logic of life, not borrowing concepts to think, nor borrowing concepts to express." Zhou Yang peddled the non-existent "imagery thinking," which was opposing Marxist epistemology. This meant that literature could not accept the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

When talking about worldview, Zhou Yang emphasized: "One cannot say that without a changed worldview, one cannot serve socialism. A doctor can use surgery to serve socialism, but his worldview may not have been changed." Regarding the relationship between worldview and creation, Zhou Yang emphasized "talent, skills, and experience." He said that some people had the same worldview, but their achievements were different. Obviously, Zhou Yang was fundamentally opposed to changing the bourgeois worldview.

Third, let's look at Zhou Yang's so-called "forming schools."

Zhou Yang often said: "A school without good teachers and good textbooks cannot form schools and good academic styles."

What was the "school" he talked about? And how was it formed? At a symposium, Zhou Yang mentioned some ancient "scholars" with great admiration, saying that it was often the case that a great scholar in a region brought a group of students, passed on his teachings, and taught his skills. Among these students, one stood out, inherited his teacher's morality and learning, and brought another group of disciples.... In this way, "one brings a group, a group produces one," knowledge accumulates, academic studies are passed down, and thus a "school" is formed. Therefore, Zhou Yang strongly emphasized the need for "old teachers to bring apprentices." He said: "Old experts, first, must bring apprentices; second, must write books." "Old experts are not many, and those who can write books are just these people. When they reach seventy or eighty, it will be difficult to write books. We are not going to excavate folk cultural heritage? These people have heritage in their brains, and it should be excavated." It was very clear that the "school" Zhou Yang wanted to establish was completely excluding Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. He wanted those feudal and capitalist "old scholars" to have "successors," so that feudal and capitalist thoughts could be passed down from generation to generation.

In summary, we can clearly see that Zhou Yang's so-called "academic construction," from "accumulating knowledge" to "summarizing laws" to "forming schools," was a thoroughgoing revisionist educational line aimed at restoring feudalism and capitalism in China.

To implement his revisionist educational line, Zhou Yang, under the banner of "opposing sectarianism," attacked and excluded the leftists in organizational terms and actively promoted the bourgeois expert line.

He used the most vicious language in the counter-revolutionary arsenal to curse the leftists in the educational revolution of 1958 as "moralists," "Puritans," cursing them as having "only passion but no truth," "only one skill, which is to fight people," and so on. He said: "Intellectuals who became leaders to persecute intellectuals were especially fierce. They thought they were representatives of the proletariat, just like peasants who became landlords, workers who became foremen, and oppressed more fiercely." Look at what he said! He slandered our revolutionary comrades as landlords who oppress peasants and foremen who oppress workers, specializing in "oppressing" people. This was sheer counter-revolutionary talk.

Zhou Yang's bourgeois expert line was specifically reflected in the following issues:

First, advocating professor-led schools. Zhou Yang's ideal university president in his mind was an "authority" like Cai Yuanpei. He said: "Whether a school is good or not mainly depends on whether you have good professors." "Whether the work of the president and the Party secretary is good or not depends on how many famous professors your school has. The authority of the president is established on the basis of the authority of professors. If your teachers are first-class, your textbooks are first-class, and your graduates are first-class, the president will have authority. Cai Yuanpei himself was not an authority in academia, but he gathered a group of authority professors in Peking University, and he had authority."

Look, this was Zhou Yang's "ideal blueprint" for the leadership of colleges and universities.

Second, in the textbook compilation work, he promoted the "chief editor responsibility system." Among the 145 humanities textbooks that Zhou Yang had already determined, there were 136 chief editors, most of whom were bourgeois experts.

Zhou Yang stipulated that "all centrally compiled books must have a chief editor"; the compilation of each textbook was implemented under the "chief editor responsibility system." What was the "chief editor responsibility system"? According to Zhou Yang's explanation: "The chief editor has the final decision on all issues of the book's compilation and debate." This meant that who to invite to participate in the compilation of a book was decided by the chief editor; according to what guiding ideology and academic viewpoint to compile was decided by the chief editor; how the final draft of a book was decided, and how to revise it after publication was all decided by the chief editor. This was the promotion of the bourgeois expert "one-man rule" in collective book compilation, opposing the proletarian democratic centralism.

Third, establishing "professional groups composed of experts" to lead the textbook compilation work. People like Jian Bozan were promoted by Zhou Yang to the position of the head of the history professional group, thus having the opportunity to peddle his reactionary historical outline.

To promote his bourgeois expert line, Zhou Yang often praised the abilities of some bourgeois "authorities," saying that "he had knowledge and views that others did not have, and his words had authority, which was called authority"; saying that "great writers had rich experience, and their words were different"; saying that "creative things could only be studied by experts"; he shamelessly said: "You should use the authority of authority to speak, and if you quote the words of authority, people will look at it with respect"; "You read less than half of him, and you cannot refute him," and so on. Zhou Yang's worship of bourgeois "authorities" was truly to the point of bowing down!

It was clear that Zhou Yang's vigorous praise of bourgeois "authorities" was to restore the superstition of bourgeois "authorities" that began to be broken in 1958, to put spiritual shackles on the thoughts of the working people again.

In the textbook compilation work, Zhou Yang encouraged some ghosts and snakes to boldly spread poison on several occasions. He said: "If others put a hat on you, I will take responsibility, I will support you. You take academic responsibility, and I take political responsibility." What a "support"! Here, Zhou Yang admitted that he was the "patriarch" of the academic gang and the big boss of counter-revolutionaries.

Not only that, Zhou Yang also used his authority to openly order the surrender of traitors. He said: "We should carefully investigate the rightists and right-opportunists. If they can engage in academic studies, we should adopt an active policy and cherish talents"; "We have worked together for more than ten years, and we cannot say there is no feeling." After the death of the war criminal Hu Shi, Zhou Yang regretted: "Hu Shi still made contributions to Chinese academia. If he did not leave, he would not be ignored." This deep affection for counter-revolutionaries nakedly exposed Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary face.

Zhou Yang was a gang leader in the literary and artistic circles, a representative of the bourgeoisie who infiltrated the Party. He was a hybrid of Chinese feudal scholars, European decadents of the 19th century, and modern revisionists. At a symposium of the foreign language group on July 1, 1961, he once admitted: "We are all products of the 19th century. The prestige of the 19th century in our minds is like that of Confucius." Therefore, Zhou Yang's ideal humanities departments of colleges and universities were the "academies" from the time of Confucius to Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao; the "talents" he wanted to cultivate were scholars like Hu Shi, Liang Qichao, and even Feng Youlan; the humanities textbooks he wanted to "build" were things like Jian Bozan's "Outline of Chinese History," Feng Youlan's "New Edition of Chinese Philosophy History," and Zhou Yousong's "Selected Chinese Historical Documents." This clearly exposed Zhou Yang's deep hatred for the entire socialist system. He wanted to restore capitalism in China through cultural, educational, academic, and humanities textbook construction.

In recent years, Chairman Mao has given a series of extremely important instructions on the fundamental policy of running humanities departments in colleges and universities. This black gang leader, Zhou Yang, has consistently paid lip service but acted in opposition, refusing to implement it. He used his authority to do many counter-revolutionary activities, leading the humanities departments of colleges and universities in a revisionist direction, producing many bad textbooks, and causing widespread harm. He was a time bomb buried within our Party. In the great proletarian cultural revolution led directly by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, this black gang was exposed, and this time bomb was dug out. This was a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly expose, criticize, and settle accounts with Zhou Yang's crimes of opposing the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. We will not stop until we achieve complete victory!

    周扬是利用文科教材推行修正主义路线的罪魁
    文新生
    周扬是一个彻头彻尾的修正主义者，他不仅是在文艺界推行修正主义路线的“祖师爷”，也是在高等学校文科反对毛泽东思想，推行修正主义路线的罪魁祸首。
    一九六○年下半年，周扬的黑手，伸进了高等学校文科。这时，正是国内外反动派纠合到一起，向党、向社会主义、向伟大的毛泽东思想发动猖狂进攻的时刻。周扬懂得，高等学校文科培养的人材，是搞意识形态的，不少人将来是要掌握国家的上层建筑的；而且在这里已集中了一大批哲学社会科学界的资产阶级“权威”、“专家”，他们是周扬宣传封建主义、资本主义、修正主义思想的主要依靠力量。周扬要为在中国复辟资本主义进行舆论准备和干部准备，高等学校文科是他必须加以控制的重要阵地。周扬说：“希望在青年，工作靠老年。”这就是说，他要依靠一批封建余孽、反共专家和资产阶级的“学者”、“权威”，把青年一代培养成资产阶级的接班人。短短两句话，道尽了周扬这个反革命黑帮首领的狼子野心。
    周扬一踏上大学文科这块基地，做的第一件事情，就是对一九五八年的教育革命和无产阶级对资产阶级学术思想的批判，进行猖狂的反攻倒算。一九六○年十月，他把“以论带史”这个史学界的革命口号，歪曲为“以论代史”，并且横加攻击，为资产阶级的反攻倒算放了第一枪。一九六一年二月，他在上海首先提出
  “未立不破”的口号，反对教育革命。接着，在同年四月，他主持召开了全国高等学校文科教材编选计划会议，抛出了系统的、全面的修正主义教育路线。从此以后，五、六年来，他一直不遗余力地反复宣传这条路线，并且招兵买马，招降纳叛，积极推行这条路线，大肆反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想。
    周扬利用领导文科教材建设工作的机会所犯下的滔天罪行，必须彻底揭发。
    对文科教学提出一整套修正主义方针
    周扬阴谋控制高等学校文科的政治野心，集中反映在他经常讲的如下一句话上，即“通过教材建设，培养人材，发展学术”。
    周扬所谓的“培养人材”，就是要培养只专不红的资产阶级精神贵族。
    周扬在一九六一年四月的高等学校文科教材编选计划会议上的讲话，以及在他亲自主持下炮制出来的文科七个专业的“教学方案”中，对文科教学，提出了一条反毛泽东思想的、彻头彻尾的修正主义路线。
    周扬把攻击的矛头，直接指向了毛主席亲手制定的教育方针，即“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。
    对于这个方针，周扬特别反感的是要培养“劳动者”。周扬恶意地歪曲说：“普通劳动者，是讲一种态度，一种作风”，不是真的要让大学毕业生去当“普通劳动者”。这是什么话！周扬的意思是说，大学毕业生，第一，不应该是“普通的”，而应该是特殊的；第二，不应该是“劳动者”，而应该是高踞在劳动人民之上的精神贵族。所以，他认为，高等学校文科的培养目标应该是“教学、研究人材”。这就是说，大学毕业生，只能够去当“教授”，当“研究员”，而不能够去当工人、农民、士兵。
    周扬还反对党的教育方针中所强调的要培养“有社会主义觉悟”的新人。他明目张胆地提出：“对大学生红的要求不要太高”，“不能要求大学毕业生都成为马克思主义者……成为政治活动家”。在业务方面，他则主张进行严格的所谓“基本理论、基本知识、基本技能”的“训练”。他一再宣称，思想落后的人也可以为社会主义“服务”。他说：“叫思想落后的去研究考古，难道怕他盗卖古物？”很明显，周扬是在提倡培养只专不红的资产阶级精神贵族。
    从这个目标出发，周扬对文科教学中的一系列关系问题，提出了一整套修正主义方针：
    关于红和专、政治和业务的关系，他一贯反对突出无产阶级政治，反对毛泽东思想挂帅。他攻击我们学习和运用毛泽东思想是“简单化、庸俗化”，污蔑现在学校里是政治“占据一切”，是毛泽东思想“代替一切”；是所谓以统帅代替兵将，以灵魂代替肉体，把“红线”变成了“红布”，政治“妨碍了业务学习”等等。他还大骂“政治太多”“就胀死人”，“一天到晚政治，哪来那么多政治”。他还要人们向孔夫子学习，说几千年前的孔夫子“不是把世界观挂在嘴上的，他很高明，他的政治挂帅挂到业务里去了……。”
    关于活的知识和书本知识的关系，周扬一贯强调的是“关门读书”。他主张用一大堆无用的书本知识充塞学生的头脑，使他们越学越蠢，越学越迷信古人、洋人，对现实政治斗争不发生兴趣，越学越瞧不起劳动人民，越不愿从事体力劳动。
    关于论与史的关系，他疯狂地攻击在学术研究中以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指导，到处攻击学习和运用革命理论是什么“空发议论”，“用现成的公式到处乱套”，“乱贴标签”。
    关于古今中外的关系，周扬别有用心地大肆宣扬所谓古代历史比现代的长，古代史和现代史教学时间的比例，“三比一还太少了”。他还提出：“古今中外的方法，就是全面的历史的观点。只有今，没有古，就没有历史观点；只有中，没有外，就没有全面观点。”周扬极力散布复古崇洋的思想，以此来对抗厚今薄古、古为今用的原则。
    关于文与道的关系，周扬大骂“现在把文与道的关系搞得绝对化了”，他污蔑学校的思想教育是“思而不学，议而不学，论而不学”，“把文以载道发展到道以代文”，把语文教材“搞成了政治课教材”等等。他反对在教学中教材中讲无产阶级的革命道理，讲马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。
    周扬讲了那么多的“关系”，实际上就是不要毛泽东思想挂帅，而要资产阶级“业务”挂帅；不是突出无产阶级政治，而是突出资产阶级政治。他的目的只有一个，就是用修正主义教育路线，来对抗毛泽东思想和党的教育方针。按照周扬所提的那一套方针培养出来的学生，只能是只专不红，只念书不劳动的资产阶级知识分子。这种学生，满脑子装的是大、洋、古，装的是封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的毒素。他们不可能是无产阶级革命事业的接班人，而必然是资产阶级的接班人。
    大量编选散布封建主义、资本主义毒素的教材
    周扬主持编选的文科教材，是宣扬封建主义、资本主义的毒草。
    周扬的魔爪一伸进高等学校文科教材这个阵地，就对一九五八年教育革命中广大师生编出的几百种文科教材，判处了“死刑”，主要的“罪名”是“水平不高”。他说：“由于对旧遗产和老专家否定过多，青年人知识准备又很不足，加上当时一些浮夸作风，这批教材一般水平都低，大都不能继续采用。”这是周扬对教育革命进行疯狂反扑的罪证。对待封建主义、资本主义的东西，周扬曾经大叫大嚷，要“未立不破”；可是，在同一个时间，同一个地点，他对于社会主义革命中产生的新生事物，却是挥舞大棒，“先破了再说”，一棍子打死。一切革命的师生，对此不能不表示万分愤慨。
    周扬把新生事物扼杀在摇篮以后，紧接着就全盘托出自己的所谓高等学校文科教材编选计划。这份计划共计二百七十三个项目，其中百分之八十是封建主义、资本主义遗产的选本和参考资料。这是明目张胆地要把一大堆古代的外国的有毒的东西，塞给学生，反对以毛泽东思想武装学生的头脑。这是周扬推行“和平演变”政策的一个重要措施。
    周扬对文科教材的质量，提出了三条要求：一、观点只要“大体稳妥”；二、材料必须“充实可靠”；三、文字要“生动简洁”。周扬提出这三条要求的意图何在呢？请看他的自供：“把马克思主义的现成结论作为套语，空发议论，乱贴标签，不能起教科书应有的传授知识的作用，而且首先是反马克思主义的。……不能要求每一本教材都具有完备的马克思列宁主义的观点，勉强要求，只能助长庸俗化、简单化的倾向。”这就十分清楚，他的三条“要求”，最主要的目的是反对用马克思列宁主义的观点统帅材料，反对毛泽东思想挂帅。
    在周扬的把持下，大量美化封建主义、资本主义的反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的东西出笼了。这些东西一出笼，就很快遭到了高等学校和社会上广大读者的反对和批评。周扬顽固地拒绝批评，派人四出“顶风”，通知各报刊对大部分试用的文科教材，不得公开发表书评。他自己则到处宣扬说，这批教材的质量，“一般比过去各校自编的都有所提高”。
    周扬贬低和否定广大革命师生集体编写教材，目的是从教材入手，否定一九五八年的教育革命，给资产阶级“学者”散布封建主义、资本主义毒素以公开合法的地位。
    大搞资产阶级的“学术建设”
    周扬妄图通过文科教材的编订，发展资产阶级的“学术”。他的行动纲领是：“通过教材建设，培养人材，发展学术。”他经常宣传，文科教材建设，不只是高等学校的一项基本建设，而且是一项重要的“学术建设”、“思想建设”、“理论建设”，是“百年大计”，“长期事业”。他表示要“卧薪尝胆”，“同教材建设共存亡”。
    周扬妄图“建设”的所谓“学术”，是地地道道的资产阶级货色。
    他所谓的“学术建设”，就是要用资产阶级的意识形态来代替无产阶级的意识形态，就是要兴资灭无。
    综观周扬在文科教材会议上的历次讲话，可以看出，他所说的“学术建设”，大致包括如下内容：一曰“积累知识”，二曰“总结规律”，三曰“形成学派”。他一向只讲“知识”，不讲政治；只讲“积累”，不讲批判；只讲“建设”，不讲革命。
    首先，我们来看看他的所谓“积累知识”。
    周扬污蔑说：在知识的准备方面，今人比起前人来，是“一代不如一代”。一九六一年五月二十四日，他在美学组的一次会上曾讲：“我们这一代人，就没有梁启超、胡适之他们准备的（知识）多。……你们再比我们读的少，那就是一代不如一代了。”这是公然长资产阶级反动“学者”的威风，灭无产阶级的志气。这是企图按照封建保皇党人和帝国主义走狗的样板来塑造无产阶级的年轻一代。这是绝对办不到的。
    到哪里去求知识呢？周扬念念不忘的，一个是“孔家店后院”的“仓库”，一个是明治维新时代的“日本橱窗”，还有一个是彼得大帝时代俄国的“翻译馆”。他说：“五四”时代提出的“打倒孔家店”的口号，太“片面了”，“不要忘记，孔家店的后院还有一个很大的仓库，那里有中国几千年的文化遗产”；明治维新时代的“日本橱窗”，里面“什么都放”；俄国的彼得大帝，“自己的创造不大，但能吸收别人的东西”，“很快就搞到外国资料”。周扬还提倡青年人要敢于“探险”，要去“查档案”、“查三代”，做到把“古今中外，熔于一炉”。这就是周扬所要“积累”的“知识”和寻求知识的途径。
    毛主席历来教导我们，知识来源于实践，文科必须以社会为工厂，文科学生必须到三大革命运动中，拜工农为师，去增长知识，增长才干。周扬反对毛主席的这些指示，他搞的这一套，就是要把青年人引向故纸堆，从而背离无产阶级革命的轨道。
    其次，看看周扬的所谓“总结规律”。
    周扬反对马克思列宁主义理论的阶级性，他强调的是“人类共同的东西”、“共同的规律”、“共性”。他说：“要衣食好，要恋爱，不能不说是全人类的需要”；“自我牺牲精神，总是维持集体生活所必需的，各个阶级都提倡，资产阶级个人主义也还讲他们的博爱”。他认为，王船山提出的“邪正、是非、功过”，可以作为评价历史人物的“共同标准”；荀子提出的教学相长，“就是各个阶级教育的共同规律”；“一定的色彩、一定的线条、一定的声音，就给人以美感”，意思是说，这就是各个阶级“共同的”审美标准。他还说：“拔下一撮头发，问有无阶级性，……也不能说地主讲的一切话都有阶级性。人的思想感情的阶级性，并非任何时候都有，否则人就不能活了。”这是对毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的学说的疯狂攻击。
    周扬反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的普遍真理，他只讲“特殊规律”，只讲“个性”。周扬千方百计要人们去寻找“特殊规律”。他说：“政治挂帅、群众路线、理论联系实际等，是一般原则，还要有特殊原则。”
    他所讲的特殊原则是什么呢？
    在讲党的领导的时候，周扬强调的是业务领导。他说：“现在有人强调外行领导内行，而不强调变外行为内行，好象越外行越好。这是鼓励工作一般化，以一般代替特殊。”这实际上是反对政治统帅业务，反对党的领导。
    周扬还强调所谓“形象思维”的特点。他说：“形象思维，是按生活的逻辑，不借概念进行思维，也不借概念来表述。”周扬贩卖根本不存在的“形象思维”，就是反对马克思主义的认识论。这就是说，文艺可以不接受马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指导。
    讲到世界观，周扬强调的是：“不能说世界观不改造好就不能为社会主义服务。医生可以用开刀为社会主义服务，但他的世界观可能没有改造好。”对世界观和创作的关系，周扬强调的是“才能、技巧和经验”。他说，有些人“世界观一样，但成就却不同。”显然，周扬是根本反对改造资产阶级世界观的。
    第三，看看周扬的所谓“形成学派”。
    周扬常说：“学校没有好教师、好教科书，学派和好的学风是形成不起来的。”
    他所说的“学派”到底是什么东西呢？又怎样形成呢？在一次座谈会上，周扬不胜景仰地提到古代一些“学者”说，常常是一个地区，出了一个大儒，带一批学生，传其道，授其业。在这一批学生中，出来一个冒尖的，继承了他老师的道德学问，再带一批徒弟，……这样“一个带一批，一批出一个”，知识就积累起来，学术就流传下去了，于是也就“形成学派了”。所以，周扬十分强调要“老教师带徒弟”。他说：“老专家，第一要带徒弟；第二要写书。”“老专家没有多少，能著书立说的就是这么一些人，等到七八十岁再著书就困难了。我们不是要挖掘民间文化遗产吗？这些人脑子里就有遗产，应该去挖掘。”这就很清楚了，周扬所要建立的“学派”，是完全排斥马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的，他是要那些封建主义、资本主义的“遗老”，
  “后继有人”，是要封建主义、资本主义思想能够传宗接代。
    综上所述，我们可以清楚地看到，周扬的所谓“学术建设”，即从“积累知识”，到“总结规律”，到“形成学派”，是一条彻头彻尾的在中国恢复封建主义、资本主义的修正主义教育路线。
    推行资产阶级专家路线
    周扬为了贯彻他的修正主义教育路线，在组织上，打着“反对宗派主义”的旗号，打击和排斥左派，积极推行资产阶级的专家路线。
    他使用了反革命武库中能够找到的最恶毒的语言，咒骂一九五八年教育革命中的左派为“道学家”、“清教徒”，骂他们“光有热情而无真理”，“只有一个本领，就是斗人”，等等。他说：“知识分子做了领导，去整知识分子就特别厉害，他觉得自己是无产阶级的代表了，就象农民做了地主，工人当了工头，压迫起来更厉害。”请看，这是什么话！他把我们革命派污蔑为骑在农民头上的地主、压在工人头上的工头，专门“压迫”人。这是不折不扣的反革命黑话。
    周扬的资产阶级专家路线，具体表现在如下几个问题上：
    第一、提倡教授治校。周扬心目中最为理想的大学校长是蔡元培那样的“权威”。他说：“一个学校好不好，主要看你有没有好教授。”“校长、党委书记的工作做得好不好，就看你这个学校有多少名教授。校长的权威就建立在教授权威的基础上。你的教师是第一流的，教材是第一流的，培养出来的学生是第一流的，校长就有权威了。蔡元培自己在学术上并不是什么权威，但他兼收并蓄，在北京大学集中了一批权威教授，他就有了权威。”
    请看，这就是周扬为高等学校绘制的一幅“好领导”的“理想的蓝图”。
    第二、在教材编选工作中推行“主编负责制”。周扬已经确定编选的一百四十五种文科教材，共有一百三十六个主编，其中大多数是资产阶级专家。
    周扬规定，“凡集中编选的书，都要有主编”；每本教材的编选，实行“主编负责制”。什么叫主编负责制呢？照周扬的解释：“全书的编选和争论的问题，主编有最后决定之权。”这就是说，一本书，请谁参加编写，要由主编挑选；按什么指导思想、什么学术观点编选，要由主编决定；一本书最后如何定稿，出版后如何修订，都取决于主编一个人的意见。这就是在集体编书中推行资产阶级专家“一长制”，反对无产阶级的民主集中制。
    第三、建立“由专家组成的”专业组，领导教材编选工作。象翦伯赞这样的人，就被周扬捧上了历史专业组组长的宝座，因而得有机会兜售他的反动史学纲领。
    周扬为了推行他的资产阶级专家路线，经常吹嘘一些资产阶级“权威”的能耐，说“他有人家所没有的知识和观点，讲话就有权，就叫权威”；说“大作家经验丰富，讲出话来就是不同”；“创造性的东西，只能专家去研究”；他无耻地说：“要借权威的身分来说话，你引证权威的话，可以使人看了肃然起敬”；“你读书不到他一半，就批不倒他”，等等。周扬对资产阶级“权威”的崇拜真是到了五体投地的地步！
    很明显，周扬这样大肆吹嘘资产阶级“权威”，其目的是要把在一九五八年开始破除的对资产阶级“权威”的迷信，重新恢复起来，是要在工农群众的思想上重新加上一副精神镣铐。
    在教材编选工作中，周扬不止一次地鼓励一些牛鬼蛇神大胆放毒。他说：“如果别人向你扣帽子，我来负责，我来撑腰。你负学术责任，我负政治责任。”好一个“我来撑腰”！在这里，周扬不打自招，承认了自己是学术界黑帮的“祖师爷”，反革命的大头目。
    不仅如此，周扬还利用职权，公开下令招降纳叛。他说：“要好好清查一下，右派、右倾机会主义分子，如能搞学问的，应采取积极的方针，要爱惜人材”；“共事十几年了，也不能说没有一点感情。”战犯胡适死了以后，周扬不胜惋惜地说：“胡适对中国的学术还是有贡献的，他要不走，不会不重视他的。”这种对反革命分子的深情厚意，赤裸裸地暴露了周扬的反革命面目。
    周扬是一个文艺界的黑帮头子，一个混入党内的资产阶级代表人物。他是中国封建士大夫、欧洲十九世纪颓废派和现代修正主义的混血儿。他在一九六一年七月一日的一次外语组座谈会上，曾经供认：“我们都是十九世纪培养出来的。十九世纪在我们脑子里的威信，等于孔夫子。”因此，周扬理想的高等学校文科，是“从孔夫子一直到康有为、梁启超”时代的“书院”，是蔡元培时代的“北京大学”；他想培养的“人材”，就是胡适之、梁启超以至冯友兰式的“学者”；他想“建设”的文科教材，就是翦伯赞的《中国史纲要》、冯友兰的《中国哲学史新编》、周予同的《中国历史文选》之类的东西。这就明显地暴露了周扬对整个社会主义制度的刻骨仇恨，他是想通过抓文化、抓教育、抓学术、抓文科教材建设，在中国复辟资本主义。
    近几年来，毛主席对高等学校文科办学的根本方针，作了一系列极为重要的指示。周扬这个黑帮头子，一贯阳奉阴违，拒不执行。他利用职权，搞了很多反革命勾当，把高等学校文科，引导到一个修正主义的方向，编出了不少坏教材，流毒甚广。他是埋藏在我们党内的一颗定时炸弹。在党中央、毛主席直接领导下的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，揪出了这个黑帮，挖出了这颗定时炸弹，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对周扬反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行，进行彻底揭发，彻底批判，彻底清算，不获全胜，决不收兵！
