Under the close care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the call of the new Beijing Municipal Committee to strive for a double harvest in the cultural revolution and agricultural production, the vast number of cadres and community members in the Beijing suburbs have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully carried forward the revolutionary spirit, and achieved decisive victory in the summer harvest while denouncing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary gang.

This year, the summer crop area in the Beijing suburbs increased by 80 percent compared to last year, and correspondingly increased the summer sowing tasks. However, under the leadership of the State Council and the new municipal committee work team, and with the strong support of the Beijing garrison troops of the People's Liberation Army, the suburban communes overcame numerous difficulties, and the vast majority of communes completed the "Three Summer" tasks quickly and well.

As the "Three Summer" work progressed, the entire suburban area launched a mass campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. The Beijing garrison troops supporting the wheat harvest, in the course of participating in labor, read Chairman Mao's books with the community members, and spoke extensively about Mao Zedong Thought, becoming a very active propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought. This played a significant role in promoting the masses to carry out the movement to study Chairman Mao's works. During the wheat harvest, many cadres and community members, whether in the field or in the fields, carried Chairman Mao's quotations, quotation cards, and newspapers, and studied whenever they had a spare moment.

The vast number of cadres and community members, after reading Chairman Mao's books, underwent a tremendous change in their spiritual outlook. "Politics should take command, not material incentives," "Fight a political battle, not a work points battle," became the strongest voices of the vast number of cadres and community members. Everyone angrily denounced the evil activities of the former Beijing Municipal Committee in promoting the revisionist line. Many cadres revealed that the former Beijing Municipal Committee, especially during the busy farming season, pushed even harder their revisionist goods of high work points and material incentives, fostering capitalist thoughts and blurring the political direction of some cadres and community members. This was a blatant opposition to Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone said that this year, by following Chairman Mao's instructions, insisting on politics taking command, not implementing high work points, the community members' enthusiasm was greater than any other year, the number of people going to work was more than any other year, and the labor efficiency was higher than any other year.

    北京郊区“三夏”生产报捷
    在党中央、毛主席的亲切关怀下，在北京新市委关于争取文化革命和农业生产双丰收的号召下，北京郊区广大干部、社员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，充分发扬革命精神，在口诛笔伐反革命黑帮的同时，取得了夏收的决定性胜利。
    今年，北京郊区的夏收作物面积比去年增加了百分之八十，相应增加了夏种的任务。但是，京郊社队在国务院、新市委工作队的领导下，在解放军驻京部队的大力支援下，克服了重重困难，绝大部分社队“三夏”任务完成得又快又好。
    随着“三夏”工作的进行，整个郊区展开了群众性的活学活用毛主席著作的活动。支援麦收的解放军驻京部队，在参加劳动中，和社员同读毛主席的书，大讲毛泽东思想，成为一支极为活跃的毛泽东思想宣传队，对推动群众开展学习毛主席著作运动，发挥了很大作用。在麦收当中，很多干部、社员不论上场和下地，都带着毛主席语录、语录牌、报纸，一有空隙就学习。
    广大干部和社员，读了毛主席的书，精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。“要政治挂帅，不要物质刺激”，“打政治仗，不打工分仗”，成为广大干部、社员最强烈的声音。大家愤怒声讨了前北京市委推行修正主义路线的罪恶活动。许多干部揭露说，前北京市委越是在农忙时，越是加劲地推销他们那套搞高工分，搞物质刺激的修正主义货色，助长了资本主义思想，模糊了部分干部、社员的政治方向，这是明目张胆地和毛泽东思想相对抗。大家说，今年按毛主席指示办事，坚持政治挂帅，没搞高工分，社员干劲比哪一年都大，出工比哪一年都多，劳动效率比哪一年都高。
