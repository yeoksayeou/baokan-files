	During de Gaulle's visit to the Soviet Union, talks were held between France and the Soviet Union. The Soviet leaders, in collaboration with U.S. imperialism's need to expand the war, are pushing for "detente" in Europe to promote the U.S. peace talks ruse.

	New China News Agency, July 4th: Moscow reports that at the invitation of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and the Soviet government, French President Charles de Gaulle visited the Soviet Union from June 20th to July 1st for an official visit. Various sources indicate that the Soviet leaders, through this round of talks, continue to promote the U.S. "peace talks" ruse on the Vietnam issue, betraying the fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people.

	De Gaulle's visit received a grand reception and great attention from the Soviet side. During the visit, Soviet leaders Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Podgorny held talks with de Gaulle, mainly discussing the situation in Southeast Asia, European issues, and Franco-Soviet relations. According to TASS, both sides reached "broad agreement" on the issues discussed.

	On June 30th, a "Soviet-French Declaration" was issued in Moscow, signed by Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Podgorny and French President de Gaulle regarding this round of talks. TASS issued a commentary on the same day, praising it as a "peace program" that "will open a new chapter in international relations." Various sources reveal that the Vietnam issue was an important topic discussed between the Soviet leaders and de Gaulle. On June 20th, Podgorny, in his speech at the banquet held for de Gaulle, had expressed the hope that the two countries would "strengthen mutual understanding and expand cooperation" on European issues and "other certain regions of the world," especially "those regions where the fires of war are still burning today." According to the Associated Press quoting a well-informed French source in Moscow, during the Franco-Soviet talks on June 21st, Podgorny once again expressed that "the Soviet Union is eager not only to cooperate with France in Europe but also in other regions where wars are currently taking place." This news agency said, "This is understood as a hint that the Soviets might try again with de Gaulle to bring the Vietnam War to the negotiating table." The Associated Press said that during the talks on June 22nd, de Gaulle also "requested Soviet support for possible new joint actions to convene a Vietnam peace conference when the time is right." According to Agence France-Presse, French Foreign Minister Debré, in his speech to French radio and television network reporters on June 24th, revealed that the Franco-Soviet talks had reached a consensus on the "necessity of ending the Vietnam War." This exposes the Soviet leaders' plot to continue promoting the U.S. "peace talks" ruse during the Franco-Soviet talks.

	According to the "Soviet-French Declaration," both sides "exchanged views" on European security and the German issue. Western news agencies reported that during the talks on European security issues, the Soviet leaders once again proposed the idea of convening a so-called European Security Conference to cooperate with the U.S. in expanding the aggression war in Southeast Asia and pushing for "detente" in Europe. France, for its own considerations, did not reach a completely unanimous agreement with the Soviet leaders on European security and the German issue. According to the "Soviet-French Declaration," the consensus position of both sides is: "European issues should first be discussed within the European scope"; European countries "should create a relaxed atmosphere between Eastern and Western countries." The declaration also states, "With the desire to finally open effective cooperation channels for all of Europe," the "endeavor to normalize the European situation" should be "continued." According to the Associated Press report on June 30th, French sources in Moscow revealed that to create a "favorable atmosphere" in Europe, the Soviet leaders had "firmly guaranteed in secret talks" that they would not create any crises (including the Berlin crisis) but would solve problems, because creating crises is not in the interest of the Soviet Union.

	The "Soviet-French Declaration" expressed the hope to "seek all possible means to maximize the development" of trade and cooperation between the two countries. According to TASS, the foreign ministers of the two countries signed a Franco-Soviet scientific and economic cooperation agreement and a ten-year agreement on cooperation in space research on the same day the declaration was issued in Moscow. Both sides also decided to establish a direct "hotline" connection between the Kremlin and the Élysée Palace to "strengthen high-level contact."

	The "Soviet-French Declaration" states that de Gaulle invited Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Podgorny to make an official visit to France. Brezhnev and the others accepted the invitation.

    在戴高乐访苏期间举行的法苏会谈中
    苏联领导人为美国推销和谈骗局
    配合美帝扩大战争需要大搞欧洲“缓和”
    新华社四日讯　莫斯科消息：应苏联最高苏维埃主席团和苏联政府的邀请，法国总统戴高乐从六月二十日到七月一日在苏联进行了正式访问。各方面透露的消息表明，苏联领导人通过这次会谈继续在越南问题上为美国推行“和谈”骗局，出卖越南人民的根本利益。
    戴高乐的这次访问，受到了苏联方面隆重的接待和极大的重视。在访问期间，苏联领导人勃列日涅夫、柯西金和波德戈尔内同戴高乐举行了会谈，主要讨论了东南亚局势、欧洲问题和法苏关系。据塔斯社报道，双方就所会谈的问题“取得了广泛一致的意见”。
    六月三十日，在莫斯科发表了由苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席波德戈尔内和法国总统戴高乐就这次会谈签署的“苏法宣言”。塔斯社当天发表评论，宣扬这是一个“和平纲领”，“将开辟国际关系的新阶段”。据各方面消息透露，越南问题是苏联领导人同戴高乐讨论的一个重要问题。六月二十日，波德戈尔内在为戴高乐举行的宴会上讲话时，就曾经表示希望苏法两国在欧洲问题和世界“其他某些地区”，特别是“那些今天战火还在燃烧的地区”的问题上“加强相互谅解和扩大合作”。据合众国际社援引在莫斯科的法国消息灵通人士的话说，在苏法双方六月二十一日会谈时，波德戈尔内再次表示，“苏联不仅迫切想同法国在欧洲合作，而且也想在其他正在进行战争的地区合作”。这家通讯社说，“这被理解为暗示苏联人可能同戴高乐一起再次设法把越南战争带到会议桌上”。合众国际社说，六月二十二日会谈时，戴高乐也曾“要求苏联支持可能采取的新的联合行动，以便在他认为时机适当时召开越南和平会议”。据法新社报道，法国外交部长德姆维尔六月二十四日对法国电台和电视网记者发表谈话时透露，法苏会谈就“结束越南战争的必要性”“取得了一致意见”。这就暴露了苏联领导人在苏法会谈中继续为美国推行“和谈骗局”的阴谋。
    据“苏法宣言”宣布，双方就欧洲安全和德国问题“交换了观点”。西方通讯社报道说，在就欧洲安全问题举行会谈时，苏联领导人再次提出召开所谓欧洲安全会议的建议，以便配合美国在东南亚扩大侵略战争的需要，在欧洲大搞“缓和”。法国出于自己的考虑，没有就欧洲安全和德国问题同苏联领导人达成完全一致的协议。据“苏法宣言”宣布，双方一致的立场是：“欧洲问题首先应当在欧洲范围内进行讨论”；欧洲各国“应当形成东西方各国之间的一种和缓气氛”。宣言还说，“应当抱着最后开辟全欧洲有成效的合作途径的愿望”把“使欧洲局势正常化的事业”“继续下去”。据美联社六月三十日报道，在莫斯科的法国人士透露，为了在欧洲创造“有利气氛”，苏联领导人在“秘密会谈”中“已经坚决保证不制造任何危机（包括柏林危机），而是要解决问题，因为制造危机是不符合苏联利益的”。
    “苏法宣言”在谈到苏法两国关系时表示“希望寻求一切可能，最大限度地发展”双方的贸易和合作。据塔斯社报道，两国外长在宣言发表的同一天在莫斯科签订了苏法科学和经济合作协定，以及一项为期十年的关于在研究宇宙方面进行合作的协定。双方还决定在克里姆林宫和爱丽舍宫之间建立直达“热线”联系，以“加强最高级的相互接触”。
    “苏法宣言”说，戴高乐邀请勃列日涅夫、柯西金和波德戈尔内对法国进行正式访问。勃列日涅夫等接受了这一邀请。
