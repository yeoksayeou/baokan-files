New China News Agency, July 22 -- The full text of the speech by Tao Zhu, Member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, at the Capital's Rally of Various Circles in Support of the Vietnamese People's Struggle Against U.S. Aggression for National Salvation is as follows:

Comrades and friends,

At a time when U.S. imperialism is escalating its aggression against Vietnam, the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, issued a partial mobilization order and published an "Open Letter to the Nation." Chairman Ho Chi Minh called on the 31 million Vietnamese people to unite as one, to persevere, to overcome difficulties, and to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors. This is a significant revolutionary action taken by the Vietnamese people, who are steadfast in proletarian internationalism and patriotism, in their great struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The Chinese people fully support this. The statement just read by Chairman Liu Shaoqi and the telegram from Chairman Zhu De to Chairman Le Duan embody the resolute determination of the 700 million Chinese people to aid Vietnam and resist U.S. aggression. Here, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, I express our highest respect to the Vietnamese people who are fighting in the trenches.

U.S. imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Vietnamese people. It has always dreamed of permanently occupying Vietnamese territory and enslaving the Vietnamese people. To realize this arrogant ambition, the U.S. aggressors have used the most barbaric means of war, slaughtering tens of thousands of people in South Vietnam, and destroying countless Vietnamese cities and villages. Unable to win its war of aggression in the South, it has extended the war to the North. Now, the U.S. forces in South Vietnam have increased to nearly 300,000, and the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam has extended to the capital, Hanoi. U.S. imperialism attempts to use the tactic of "escalating the war" to force the Vietnamese people to surrender. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Open Letter to the Nation" gives a powerful response to this policy of war blackmail by U.S. imperialism.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh solemnly declares: "The U.S. imperialists can send 500,000, 1 million, or even more troops to strengthen their war of aggression in South Vietnam. They can use thousands of planes to intensify their bombing of North Vietnam. But they cannot shake the iron will and determination of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation." "The war can last 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, or even longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be intimidated! There is nothing more precious than independence and freedom." "When the day of victory comes," the Vietnamese people "will rebuild their country more magnificently and splendidly!"

Chairman Ho Chi Minh solemnly declares: "The U.S. must stop its war of aggression against Vietnam and must withdraw all its troops and mercenaries from Vietnam, and then peace will be immediately restored." "The Vietnamese people love peace, love true peace, peace based on independence and freedom, not the false peace, the 'peace' of the American style."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh's words express the common resolve of the 31 million Vietnamese people to decisively defeat the U.S. aggressors, and are the solemn vow of the Vietnamese people to stand firm. The ferocious U.S. imperialists have been beaten to a standstill by the Vietnamese people, and no matter how desperately they struggle, they cannot escape their inevitable defeat in the face of the Vietnamese people who are fearless and determined to fight a protracted war.

Chairman Mao has said: "In the history of mankind, all reactionary forces that are about to perish always make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces, and some revolutionaries are often deceived by this external strength and internal weakness for a period, failing to see that the enemy is about to be eliminated and they are about to win." The U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is precisely a manifestation of its desperate struggle. At this moment, the Vietnamese people are not afraid of destroying their pots and pans, not afraid of making great sacrifices, and are determined to fight to the end with U.S. imperialism. This spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win will undoubtedly play a decisive role in the Vietnamese people's complete victory over the U.S. aggressors and in achieving complete victory in the struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

In the face of U.S. imperialism's escalation of its war of aggression against Vietnam, the Soviet revisionist leadership has always played the role of the chief accomplice. Especially in the face of the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong and the implementation of the "bombing to force peace" plot, the activities of the Soviet leadership have been even more enthusiastic. At a time when people all over the world are condemning the U.S. barbaric bombing, the Soviet representative shamelessly declared that the U.S. bombing does not affect U.S.-Soviet cooperation and the conclusion of disarmament agreements. On the other hand, the Soviet revisionist leadership is promoting so-called détente in Europe, allowing U.S. imperialism to concentrate its forces on the aggression against Vietnam. This is the greatest cooperation and assistance to U.S. imperialism.

Recently, the Indian Prime Minister proposed the so-called "peace" initiative to reconvene the Geneva Conference before his visit to Moscow. As soon as the Indian Prime Minister left, the British Prime Minister hurriedly went. Moscow has become the center for helping the U.S. to promote the "peace" fraud.

The recent Soviet-Indian joint statement also exposed the tracks of serving the U.S. imperialist plot. This statement made no condemnation of the serious crimes of the U.S. escalation of aggression against Vietnam, but instead, without distinguishing right from wrong, called on "all governments to abandon the use of force." This is an attempt to force the 31 million Vietnamese people, in the face of the U.S. escalation of aggression, to lay down their arms and give up the national war of resistance, which the heroic Vietnamese people absolutely cannot accept.

This statement says that the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam should be stopped immediately, and that the solution to the Vietnamese problem can only be found within the scope of the 1954 Geneva Agreement on Indochina. Everyone knows that the core of the current Vietnamese problem is absolutely not just the issue of stopping the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Emphasizing the unilateral cessation of bombing is precisely in line with the needs of U.S. imperialism's policy of blackmail. The purpose of the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam is to make people beg for it to stop bombing and accept its surrender terms. One is "bombing to force peace," and the other says that as long as the bombing stops, peace talks can be held. This is openly colluding with U.S. imperialism.

At a time when the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation is at a critical juncture, someone, under the instructions of the U.S., has picked up the Geneva Agreement to serve U.S. imperialism, which is unacceptable. It must be pointed out that U.S. imperialism has long since torn up the Geneva Agreement. The Geneva Agreement has been resisted and sabotaged by the U.S. from the very beginning. The U.S. refused to sign the Geneva Agreement and replaced France in Vietnam, turning South Vietnam into a base for U.S. aggression. From then on, the restrictions and boundaries set by the Geneva Agreement have been broken. U.S. imperialism's war of aggression in South Vietnam further broke these restrictions and boundaries. The U.S. bombing of North Vietnam completely broke the boundaries between South and North Vietnam. Now, the U.S. has bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which has finally buried the Geneva Agreement, and all the restrictions and boundaries set by it have been completely abolished.

Under these circumstances, anyone who still tries to use the Geneva Agreement to tie the hands of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of the world is absolutely impossible!

Under these circumstances, whatever actions the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of the world take to counterattack the U.S. aggressors are completely justified!

Under these circumstances, China's support and assistance to the Vietnamese people will be even more unrestricted and unconstrained. The Chinese people have made up their minds and are prepared to take any necessary actions, together with the peoples of China and Vietnam, to strike back at the U.S. aggressors at any time and in any place.

The Geneva Agreement no longer exists! Under the current situation, to talk about the Geneva Agreement, the U.S. must unconditionally, immediately, completely, thoroughly, and cleanly withdraw all its armed forces from Vietnam, otherwise, it is to allow the U.S. to occupy Vietnam and enslave the Vietnamese people. This is something that the heroic Vietnamese people absolutely cannot tolerate. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's proclamation has already given a resounding answer.

Comrades and friends,

China and Vietnam are socialist countries that are as close as lips and teeth, and our peoples are brothers who share weal and woe. In the long struggle against imperialism, our two peoples have forged a deep bond of combat friendship. In the face of our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, there is no force in the world that can separate us. The trend of historical development determines that our two peoples will unite, fight together, and win together.

The Vietnamese people have already achieved brilliant victories and will certainly achieve final victory. The 700 million Chinese people are the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people. The vast territory of China is the reliable rear area of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people are determined to take any risks and pay any price to resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying out their struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation to the end.

U.S. aggressors, get out of Vietnam!

Long live the heroic Vietnamese people!

Long live the revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam!

    在首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会上
    陶铸副总理的讲话
    新华社二十二日讯　中共中央书记处书记、国务院副总理陶铸同志在首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会上的讲话，全文如下：同志们，朋友们：
    在美帝国主义加紧侵略越南的时候，越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席颁布了局部动员令，发表了《告全国同胞书》。胡志明主席号召三千一百万越南人民，团结一致，再接再厉，坚持斗争，不怕困难，彻底打败美国侵略者。这是坚持无产阶级国际主义和爱国主义的越南人民，在抗美救国的伟大斗争中采取的具有重大意义的革命行动。中国人民对此表示最坚决的支持。刚刚宣读的刘少奇主席的声明和朱德委员长给长征主席的电报，体现了七亿中国人民援越抗美的坚定决心。在这里，我代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民向战斗中的兄弟的越南人民致以最崇高的敬意。
    美帝国主义是越南人民不共戴天的敌人。它一直梦想长期霸占越南的国土，奴役越南人民。为了实现这个狂妄的野心，美国侵略者使用了最野蛮的战争手段，屠杀了几十万越南南方人民，毁坏了无数的越南城市和乡村。它在南方的侵略战争打不赢，就把战火扩大到北方。现在，美国在越南南方的侵略军已经增加到近三十万人，美国对越南北方的轰炸已经扩展到越南民主共和国首都河内。美帝国主义妄图用“战争升级”的办法，迫使越南人民屈服投降。胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》，对美帝国主义的这种战争讹诈政策，作出了最强有力的回答。
    胡志明主席庄严宣告：美帝国主义“可以出动五十万、一百万或者更多的军队来加强对越南南方的侵略战争。他们可以使用成千架飞机来加强对越南北方的轰炸。但是，他们绝不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。”“战争可以延长五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，河内、海防和其他一些城市、企业可能被摧毁，但是越南人民是不会被吓倒的！没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。”“在胜利的日子到来的时候”，越南人民“将重新把自己的祖国建设得更加堂皇，更加壮丽！”
    胡志明主席庄严宣告：“美国必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须把美国军队和它的帮凶军全部撤出越南，这样和平就会立即恢复。”“越南人民十分热爱和平，热爱真正的和平，在独立、自由基础上的和平，而不是假和平、美国式的‘和平’。”
    胡志明主席的这些话，表达了三千一百万越南人民坚决打败美国侵略者的共同决心，是越南人民气壮山河的誓言。穷凶极恶的美帝国主义已经被越南人民打得焦头烂额、走投无路，不管它还将进行怎样疯狂的挣扎，在天不怕、地不怕、决心进行长期抗战的越南人民面前，都无法逃脱它必然失败的命运。
    毛主席曾经说过：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的，而有些革命的人们也往往在一个期间内被这种外强中干的现象所迷惑，看不出敌人快要消灭，自己快要胜利的实质。”美国对河内、海防的轰炸，正是它进行绝望挣扎的表现。在这样的时刻，越南人民不怕打烂坛坛罐罐，不怕作出重大牺牲，决心同美帝国主义干到底，这种敢于斗争，敢于胜利的精神，必将对越南人民彻底打败美国侵略者，争取抗美救国斗争的完全胜利，产生决定性的作用。
    在美帝国主义扩大侵略越南的战争中，苏联修正主义领导集团一直扮演着头号帮凶的角色。特别是在美国轰炸河内、海防，推行“以炸迫和”的阴谋中，苏联领导集团的配合活动更加卖力。在全世界人民愤怒谴责美国的野蛮轰炸的时候，苏联代表竟然丧心病狂地宣称，美国的轰炸并不影响美苏合作、达成裁军协议。另一方面，苏联修正主义领导集团却在欧洲大搞所谓和缓，使美帝国主义得以集中力量侵略越南。这是对美帝国主义最大的配合和帮忙。
    最近，印度总理在出发访问莫斯科之前，提出了重新召开日内瓦会议的所谓“和平”建议。印度总理刚刚离开，英国首相匆忙赶去。莫斯科已经成为帮助美国推销“和谈”骗局的中心。
    前几天发表的苏印联合公报，也露出了为美帝国主义阴谋效劳的马脚。这个公报对美国扩大侵略越南的严重罪行，没有进行任何谴责，反而不分是非地呼吁“所有的政府放弃使用武力”。这就是妄图迫使三千
  一百万越南人民，在美国加紧扩大侵略战争的面前，放下武器，放弃全民族的反侵略战争，这是英雄的越南人民绝对不能答应的。
    这个公报说什么对越南民主共和国的轰炸应当立即停止，只有在一九五四年关于印度支那的日内瓦协议范围内才能找到解决越南问题的办法。谁都知道，当前越南问题的核心，绝不是什么仅仅停止对越南民主共和国轰炸的问题。片面强调停止轰炸，正是适应了美帝国主义讹诈政策的需要。美国轰炸越南北方的目的，就是要人们向它求饶，乞求它停止轰炸，接受它的投降条件。一个是“以炸迫和”，一个说只要停止轰炸，就可以和谈，这是公开地同美帝国主义一唱一和。
    正当越南人民的抗美救国战争处于决战决胜的关头，竟然有人在美国的授意之下拣起了日内瓦协议，为美帝国主义效劳，这是不能容许的。必须指出，美帝国主义早已把日内瓦协议撕光了。日内瓦协议从一开始就遭到了美国的抵制和破坏。美国拒绝在日内瓦协议上签字，并且取代了法国在越南的地位，把越南南方变成美国的侵略基地。从那时起，日内瓦协议规定的限制和界限，就已经被美国打破了。美帝国主义在越南南方发动侵略战争，进一步打破了这种限制和界限。美国轰炸越南北方，更彻底打破了越南南方和北方的界限。现在，美国轰炸了越南民主共和国的首都，这就最后埋葬了日内瓦协议，日内瓦协议的一切限制和界限被统统地取消了。
    在这种情况下，任何人还企图用日内瓦协议来束缚越南人民的手脚，束缚中国人民的手脚，束缚世界革命人民的手脚，那是绝对办不到的！
    在这种情况下，越南人民、中国人民、世界革命人民，不论采取什么行动，来反击美国侵略者，都是天经地义的！
    在这种情况下，中国人民对越南人民的支持和援助，就更加不受任何限制和约束了。中国人民下定了决心，做好了各种准备，随时随地采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动，共同打击美国侵略者。
    日内瓦协议已经不存在了！在目前形势下，要谈日内瓦协议，就必须要美国无条件地立即、全部、彻底、干净地撤出它在越南的武装力量，否则，就是听任美国霸占越南，听任美国奴役越南人民。这是英雄的越南人民绝对不能容忍的。胡志明主席的文告，已经做了响亮的回答。
    同志们，朋友们：
    中越两国是唇齿相依的社会主义国家，我们两国人民是患难与共的兄弟。我们两国人民在反对帝国主义的长期斗争中，结成了深厚的战斗友谊。面对着我们两国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义，世界上更没有任何力量能够把我们分开。历史发展的趋势决定了我们两国人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    越南人民已经取得了辉煌的胜利，一定会取得最后胜利。七亿中国人民，是越南人民的坚强后盾。辽阔的中国国土，是越南人民的可靠后方。中国人民决心不怕冒任何风险，不惜付出任何重大代价，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国的斗争进行到最后胜利。
    美国侵略者从越南滚出去！
    英雄的越南人民万岁！
    中越两国人民的革命友谊万岁！
