New China News Agency, July 22 -- The full text of the speech by Tao Zhu, Member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, at the Capital's Rally of Various Circles in Support of the Vietnamese People's Struggle Against U.S. Aggression for National Salvation is as follows:

Comrades and friends,

At a time when U.S. imperialism is escalating its aggression against Vietnam, the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, issued a partial mobilization order and published an "Open Letter to the Nation." Chairman Ho Chi Minh called on the 31 million Vietnamese people to unite as one, to persevere, to overcome difficulties, and to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors. This is a significant revolutionary action taken by the Vietnamese people, who are steadfast in proletarian internationalism and patriotism, in their great struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The Chinese people fully support this. The statement just read by Chairman Liu Shaoqi and the telegram from Chairman Zhu De to Chairman Le Duan embody the resolute determination of the 700 million Chinese people to aid Vietnam and resist U.S. aggression. Here, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, I express our highest respect to the Vietnamese people who are fighting in the trenches.

U.S. imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Vietnamese people. It has always dreamed of permanently occupying Vietnamese territory and enslaving the Vietnamese people. To realize this arrogant ambition, the U.S. aggressors have used the most barbaric means of war, slaughtering tens of thousands of people in South Vietnam, and destroying countless Vietnamese cities and villages. Unable to win its war of aggression in the South, it has extended the war to the North. Now, the U.S. forces in South Vietnam have increased to nearly 300,000, and the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam has extended to the capital, Hanoi. U.S. imperialism attempts to use the tactic of "escalating the war" to force the Vietnamese people to surrender. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Open Letter to the Nation" gives a powerful response to this policy of war blackmail by U.S. imperialism.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh solemnly declares: "The U.S. imperialists can send 500,000, 1 million, or even more troops to strengthen their war of aggression in South Vietnam. They can use thousands of planes to intensify their bombing of North Vietnam. But they cannot shake the iron will and determination of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation." "The war can last 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, or even longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be intimidated! There is nothing more precious than independence and freedom." "When the day of victory comes," the Vietnamese people "will rebuild their country more magnificently and splendidly!"

Chairman Ho Chi Minh solemnly declares: "The U.S. must stop its war of aggression against Vietnam and must withdraw all its troops and mercenaries from Vietnam, and then peace will be immediately restored." "The Vietnamese people love peace, love true peace, peace based on independence and freedom, not the false peace, the 'peace' of the American style."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh's words express the common resolve of the 31 million Vietnamese people to decisively defeat the U.S. aggressors, and are the solemn vow of the Vietnamese people to stand firm. The ferocious U.S. imperialists have been beaten to a standstill by the Vietnamese people, and no matter how desperately they struggle, they cannot escape their inevitable defeat in the face of the Vietnamese people who are fearless and determined to fight a protracted war.

Chairman Mao has said: "In the history of mankind, all reactionary forces that are about to perish always make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces, and some revolutionaries are often deceived by this external strength and internal weakness for a period, failing to see that the enemy is about to be eliminated and they are about to win." The U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is precisely a manifestation of its desperate struggle. At this moment, the Vietnamese people are not afraid of destroying their pots and pans, not afraid of making great sacrifices, and are determined to fight to the end with U.S. imperialism. This spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win will undoubtedly play a decisive role in the Vietnamese people's complete victory over the U.S. aggressors and in achieving complete victory in the struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

In the face of U.S. imperialism's escalation of its war of aggression against Vietnam, the Soviet revisionist leadership has always played the role of the chief accomplice. Especially in the face of the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong and the implementation of the "bombing to force peace" plot, the activities of the Soviet leadership have been even more enthusiastic. At a time when people all over the world are condemning the U.S. barbaric bombing, the Soviet representative shamelessly declared that the U.S. bombing does not affect U.S.-Soviet cooperation and the conclusion of disarmament agreements. On the other hand, the Soviet revisionist leadership is promoting so-called d√©tente in Europe, allowing U.S. imperialism to concentrate its forces on the aggression against Vietnam. This is the greatest cooperation and assistance to U.S. imperialism.

Recently, the Indian Prime Minister proposed the so-called "peace" initiative to reconvene the Geneva Conference before his visit to Moscow. As soon as the Indian Prime Minister left, the British Prime Minister hurriedly went. Moscow has become the center for helping the U.S. to promote the "peace" fraud.

The recent Soviet-Indian joint statement also exposed the tracks of serving the U.S. imperialist plot. This statement made no condemnation of the serious crimes of the U.S. escalation of aggression against Vietnam, but instead, without distinguishing right from wrong, called on "all governments to abandon the use of force." This is an attempt to force the 31 million Vietnamese people, in the face of the U.S. escalation of aggression, to lay down their arms and give up the national war of resistance, which the heroic Vietnamese people absolutely cannot accept.

This statement says that the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam should be stopped immediately, and that the solution to the Vietnamese problem can only be found within the scope of the 1954 Geneva Agreement on Indochina. Everyone knows that the core of the current Vietnamese problem is absolutely not just the issue of stopping the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Emphasizing the unilateral cessation of bombing is precisely in line with the needs of U.S. imperialism's policy of blackmail. The purpose of the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam is to make people beg for it to stop bombing and accept its surrender terms. One is "bombing to force peace," and the other says that as long as the bombing stops, peace talks can be held. This is openly colluding with U.S. imperialism.

At a time when the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation is at a critical juncture, someone, under the instructions of the U.S., has picked up the Geneva Agreement to serve U.S. imperialism, which is unacceptable. It must be pointed out that U.S. imperialism has long since torn up the Geneva Agreement. The Geneva Agreement has been resisted and sabotaged by the U.S. from the very beginning. The U.S. refused to sign the Geneva Agreement and replaced France in Vietnam, turning South Vietnam into a base for U.S. aggression. From then on, the restrictions and boundaries set by the Geneva Agreement have been broken. U.S. imperialism's war of aggression in South Vietnam further broke these restrictions and boundaries. The U.S. bombing of North Vietnam completely broke the boundaries between South and North Vietnam. Now, the U.S. has bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which has finally buried the Geneva Agreement, and all the restrictions and boundaries set by it have been completely abolished.

Under these circumstances, anyone who still tries to use the Geneva Agreement to tie the hands of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of the world is absolutely impossible!

Under these circumstances, whatever actions the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of the world take to counterattack the U.S. aggressors are completely justified!

Under these circumstances, China's support and assistance to the Vietnamese people will be even more unrestricted and unconstrained. The Chinese people have made up their minds and are prepared to take any necessary actions, together with the peoples of China and Vietnam, to strike back at the U.S. aggressors at any time and in any place.

The Geneva Agreement no longer exists! Under the current situation, to talk about the Geneva Agreement, the U.S. must unconditionally, immediately, completely, thoroughly, and cleanly withdraw all its armed forces from Vietnam, otherwise, it is to allow the U.S. to occupy Vietnam and enslave the Vietnamese people. This is something that the heroic Vietnamese people absolutely cannot tolerate. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's proclamation has already given a resounding answer.

Comrades and friends,

China and Vietnam are socialist countries that are as close as lips and teeth, and our peoples are brothers who share weal and woe. In the long struggle against imperialism, our two peoples have forged a deep bond of combat friendship. In the face of our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, there is no force in the world that can separate us. The trend of historical development determines that our two peoples will unite, fight together, and win together.

The Vietnamese people have already achieved brilliant victories and will certainly achieve final victory. The 700 million Chinese people are the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people. The vast territory of China is the reliable rear area of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people are determined to take any risks and pay any price to resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying out their struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation to the end.

U.S. aggressors, get out of Vietnam!

Long live the heroic Vietnamese people!

Long live the revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam!
