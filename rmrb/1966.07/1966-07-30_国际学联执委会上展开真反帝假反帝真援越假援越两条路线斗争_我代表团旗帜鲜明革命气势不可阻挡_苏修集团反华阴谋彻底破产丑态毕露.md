The struggle between true anti-imperialism and false anti-imperialism, true support for Vietnam and false support for Vietnam unfolded at the International Students Union Executive Committee. Our delegation, with a clear revolutionary banner and an unstoppable revolutionary spirit, exposed the true face of the Soviet revisionist group as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. The Chinese delegation's firm revolutionary line and clear revolutionary banner received praise and support from many representatives, forming an unstoppable revolutionary momentum. The various anti-China plots played by the Soviet revisionists at the meeting were weak and exposed in all their ugliness under the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought, leading to their complete failure.

This meeting was held from July 11 to July 20. The characteristics of this meeting are as follows: First, the meeting was convened after Johnson ordered the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong. Moscow was brewing a new Munich conspiracy to betray the Vietnamese people. Therefore, whether to strongly condemn U.S. imperialism's bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong and its plot of "bombing to force negotiations," and whether to strongly condemn the Soviet leadership's role as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism and expose the conspiracy to reconvene the Geneva Conference in Moscow, became the focal point of the struggle at the meeting. Second, the meeting was held after the 23rd Congress of the CPSU and the 15th Congress of the Soviet Komsomol. The reactionary nature of the Soviet revisionist leadership's manipulation and use of the International Students Union to promote its revisionist line was more exposed.

From the beginning of the meeting, a fierce struggle unfolded over the first agenda item, the Vietnam issue. On the first day of the meeting, the Chinese delegation submitted an urgent appeal on the Vietnam issue, requesting that the meeting discuss and adopt it. After Chairman Ho Chi Minh issued his "Letter to the Nation" on July 17, on the morning of the 18th, the Chinese delegation submitted a motion to send a telegram in firm support of Chairman Ho's "Letter to the Nation." Finally, a draft resolution on the Vietnam issue was proposed.

In their speeches on the Vietnam issue, China and many other representatives strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, escalating the war in Vietnam to a new and more serious stage. The Chinese representative said, "U.S. imperialism has completely torn up the Geneva Agreement and broken the boundaries of war. The Chinese students and people firmly support the Chinese government's statement of July 3, which will, without restriction and in all possible ways, support the struggle of the Vietnamese people according to their interests and demands." The Venezuelan representative said, "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Vietnamese people and the Venezuelan people. The best support for the Vietnamese people is to firmly fight against U.S. imperialism."

The Ecuadorian representative said in his speech, "As long as there is one American soldier on Vietnamese soil, there can be no negotiations. As long as the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is not recognized as the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people, there can be no negotiations."

The Chinese representative also exposed the true face of the Soviet leadership as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism on the Vietnam issue. The draft resolution on the Vietnam issue proposed by China stated: "The Soviet leadership, in order to bring the Vietnam issue into the track of 'Sino-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world,' has been colluding with U.S. imperialism, playing tricks of false support and true betrayal of the Vietnamese people. The Soviet leadership, in order to meet the needs of U.S. imperialism, has never stopped promoting its 'peace talks' conspiracy and, in the recent conspiracy to reconvene the Geneva Conference, has played the most despicable and shameful role. The Soviet leadership, in order to cooperate with the strategic shift of U.S. imperialism to the East, is conspiring to achieve reconciliation and disarmament in Europe, so that U.S. imperialism can concentrate on its aggression against Vietnam." The draft resolution pointed out that the Soviet leadership also spread rumors and slandered China for obstructing the transit of aid to Vietnam, attempting to sow discord between China and Vietnam, and shamelessly attacking China.

However, the Soviet revisionist group harbored hostility towards the Chinese delegation's firm support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and adopted fascist methods to brutally suppress the three documents related to the Vietnam issue proposed by China, not allowing them to be discussed or adopted at the meeting. This proved that their support for Vietnam was completely false, and their true intention was to betray the revolutionary cause of the Vietnamese people and act as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism.

In the speeches on the second agenda item, the Chinese representative exposed the Soviet revisionist control over the International Students Union, which followed a line of capitulationism, splitism, and anti-China. He cited a series of facts to expose how the leaders of the Soviet student organizations imposed a line of "Sino-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," "peaceful coexistence," "complete and thorough disarmament," and anti-China on the International Students Union. He pointed out that the Soviet leaders loudly proclaimed "united action," but in reality, it was a united action against China, a united action with the Kuomintang against China, and a united action with the tools of U.S. imperialism, the United Nations, and all reactionaries against the national liberation movement and the people's revolutionary struggle. To closely cooperate with the strategic needs of U.S. imperialism, they are quickly colluding with the reactionaries in Asia, degenerating to the point of conspiring with Japanese militarists, the Kuomintang bandits, the South Vietnamese and South Korean puppets to attempt to build a "wall to contain China" around China. The latest anti-China evidence that occurred at this meeting is: in the report of the second agenda item of the International Students Union, the conspiracy of creating "two Chinas" was deliberately manufactured. In the report of the International Students Union, Taiwan, a part of Chinese territory, was listed alongside other countries. The Chinese delegation strongly protested this, considering it a serious provocation against the Chinese people.

The Chinese representative also exposed that the Soviet revisionists, while actively engaging in anti-China activities within the International Students Union, were also actively collaborating with imperialism. He said that under the pretext of promoting international student unity and cooperation, the Soviet revisionists had once proposed the extremely erroneous suggestion to dissolve the International Students Union and merge it with the reactionary "International Student Conference," which was a concrete manifestation of their complete organizational capitulation and pursuit of Sino-Soviet cooperation.

To change the entire set of erroneous lines of the International Students Union, which advocates "Sino-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world" and united action against China, the Chinese delegation finally proposed a draft general resolution, calling for a severe condemnation of the Soviet revisionist line and the establishment of a broad and genuine international united front against imperialism led by the United States, supporting the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and supporting the armed struggles and people's wars of the peoples of various countries. At this time, the Soviet delegation and its followers attempted to prevent the meeting from discussing this draft general resolution, but they were opposed by representatives from the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, the Federation of Black African Students in France, and others. The Soviet representative instructed the chairman (an Indian) to suppress the discussion and immediately put the motion proposed by the Sudanese representative, that the meeting had no right to discuss the line issue, to a vote.

In the speeches on the third agenda item, the Chinese representative expressed firm support for the struggles of the peoples of African and Arab countries against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States.

The meeting adopted a large number of resolutions from the evening of the 19th to the morning of the 20th. The Chinese delegation issued a general voting statement, stating that the Chinese delegation voted in favor of the resolutions in support of the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. However, since the resolutions did not include content opposing the Soviet revisionists as accomplices of U.S. imperialism, the Chinese delegation had reservations about this.

Finally, the Chinese delegation issued a general statement on the meeting, expressing the Chinese delegation's firm stance in supporting the anti-imperialist struggles of the students and peoples of Vietnam and Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The general statement pointed out: All revolutionary peoples have raised their awareness through this meeting. All revolutionary students and peoples should abandon their illusions about U.S. imperialism and its accomplice, the Soviet revisionists. They should oppose Soviet revisionism to continue the struggle against U.S. imperialism to victory. Without struggling against Soviet revisionism, it is impossible to carry the anti-imperialist struggle to complete victory.

The progress of this meeting shows that the Soviet revisionist group is politically extremely weak, unable to deny their own accomplice crimes and dare not engage in substantive discussions with others. Therefore, they had to resort to thorough fascist methods to deal with the exposure and condemnation by revolutionaries. They manipulated the meeting, and whenever China and other revolutionaries spoke, they either had the chairman rudely interrupt, or cut off the power to the microphone, or had their thugs bang on the table, shout loudly, and stomp their feet to create a disturbance. They were terrified of any truly anti-imperialist and truly revolutionary suggestions, so they dared not discuss them. Some suggestions made them so flustered that they hastily announced a recess.

The Soviet revisionist group, not daring to engage in a struggle at the meeting, also resorted to various shameless and despicable methods outside the meeting to blackmail and bribe representatives who did not listen to them. One of them once took a camera to a representative of a certain country and said, "Hey! If you support the Soviet line, this camera is yours." The unfortunate fellow's response was, "Take back your thing. We would rather be beheaded or imprisoned than take your camera!"

Some representatives who had previously participated in meetings of the International Students Union said that the International Students Union still had a bit of false democracy on the surface, but this time even this bit of false democratic cover was completely stripped away. Some representatives who participated in the International Students Union meeting for the first time said that just this once, we saw through it: the International Students Union is an organization that confuses friends and enemies; it is a tool serving imperialism and opposing revolutionary China and other revolutionary organizations. Some said, this is simply the United Nations, its future can only be doomed!

Yes, whether it is U.S. imperialism or its accomplice, Soviet revisionism, their future can only be doomed. As Chairman Mao said: "All the people of the world must have the courage to fight, dare to struggle, fear no difficulties, and press on regardless of the cost. Then, the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All demons will be destroyed."

    国际学联执委会上展开真反帝假反帝真援越假援越两条路线斗争
    我代表团旗帜鲜明革命气势不可阻挡
    苏修集团反华阴谋彻底破产丑态毕露
    据新华社二十九日讯  开罗消息：最近在开罗举行的国际学生联合会执行委员会会议上，中国学生代表团高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争，坚决反对苏联修正主义领导集团充当美帝国主义帮凶，坚决反对苏联修正主义领导集团把国际学联当作推行它的投降主义和分裂主义错误路线的工具。中国代表团在会上揭露了苏修作为美帝头号帮凶的真面目。
    中国坚定的革命路线，鲜明的革命旗帜，得到了许多代表的赞扬和支持，在会上形成了一股不可阻挡的革命气势。而苏联修正主义在会上玩弄的种种反华阴谋，却显得虚弱不堪，在毛泽东思想的照妖镜下，丑态毕露，纷纷宣告破产。
    这次会议是在七月十一日到二十日举行的。这次会议的特点是：第一，会议是在约翰逊下令轰炸河内、海防以后召开的，莫斯科正在酝酿一个出卖越南人民的新慕尼黑大阴谋。因此，要不要强烈谴责美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防的罪行和“以炸迫和”的阴谋，要不要强烈谴责苏联领导集团充当美帝国主义帮凶、揭露在莫斯科策划的重新召开日内瓦会议的阴谋，就成为会议斗争的焦点。第二，会议是在苏共二十三大和苏联共青团十五大以后召开的。苏联修正主义领导集团操纵和利用国际学联推行它的修正主义路线的反动面目更加暴露。
    会议一开始，就在第一项议程越南问题上展开了激烈的斗争。会议开始的第一天，中国代表团就提出了越南问题的紧急呼吁书，要求会议讨论、通过。在胡志明主席七月十七日发表《告全国同胞书》后，十八日上午，中国代表团又提出临时动议，要求会议发电报坚决支持胡主席的《告全国同胞书》。最后又提出了关于越南问题的决议草案。
    中国和其他许多代表在关于越南问题的发言中，强烈谴责美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防，把侵越战争升级到一个新的更严重的阶段。中国代表说，美帝国主义已经彻底撕碎日内瓦协议，打破了战争的界限。中国学生和人民坚决支持中国政府七月三日的声明，将根据越南人民的利益和要求，不受限制地、用一切可能的方式支援越南人民的斗争。委内瑞拉代表说，美帝国主义是越南人民和委内瑞拉人民的共同敌人。对越南人民最好的声援，就是坚决同美帝国主义进行斗争。
    厄瓜多尔代表在发言中说，“只要在越南领土上，还有一个美国兵，就不能和谈，只要不承认越南南方民族解放阵线为南越人民唯一真正代表，就不能和谈。”
    中国代表还揭露了苏联领导集团在越南问题上充当美帝国主义帮凶的真相。中国提出的关于越南问题的决议草案说：“苏联领导集团为了把越南问题纳入‘苏美合作主宰世界’的轨道，一直在同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，玩弄对越南人民假支持真出卖的诡计。苏联领导集团为了迎合美帝国主义的需要，从来没有停止推行它的‘和谈’阴谋，并且在最近的重新召开日内瓦会议的阴谋中，扮演了最卑鄙、最可耻的角色。苏联领导集团为了配合美帝国主义的战略重点东移，阴谋在欧洲进行和解和裁军，以便美帝国主义能放手加紧它对越南的侵略。”决议草案指出，苏联领导集团还造谣污蔑中国阻挠援越物资过境运往越南，企图挑拨中国和越南之间的关系，并无耻地攻击中国。
    但是，苏联修正主义集团仇视中国代表团坚决支持越南抗美救国斗争的立场，对中国提出的三个有关越南问题的文件，采取了法西斯手段，粗暴地加以扼杀，根本不许在会上讨论、通过。这就证明：他们支持越南完全是假的，出卖越南人民革命事业、充当美帝国主义帮凶才是真的。
    在第二项议程的发言中，中国代表揭露了苏联修正主义控制国际学联奉行投降主义、分裂主义和反华的路线。他列举一系列事实，揭露苏联学生组织领导人把一条“苏美合作主宰世界”、“和平共处”、“全面彻底裁军”和反华的错误路线强加于国际学联。他指出，苏联领导人大肆叫嚷什么“联合行动”，实际上是联美反华，联蒋反华，联合美帝国主义的工具联合国和一切反动派反对民族解放运动，反对人民革命斗争。为了密切配合美帝国主义战略需要，他们正加紧同亚洲反动派勾结，堕落到同日本军国主义者、蒋匪帮、南越、南朝鲜傀儡一起，妄图在中国周围建立一道“遏制中国的墙”。而发生在这次会议上的最新反华罪证是：在国际学联第二项议程的报告中蓄意制造“两个中国”的阴谋。在国际学联的报告中，竟把中国领土的一部分台湾同其他国家并列，中国代表团对此提出了最强烈的抗议，认为这是对中国人民的严重挑衅。
    中国代表还揭露，苏联修正主义者在国际学联组织内一面积极反华，一面却同帝国主义大搞团结合作。他说，苏联修正主义在增进国际学生统一、合作的幌子下，曾经提出取消国际学联，与反动的“国际学生会议”合并的极其错误的主张，这是他们在组织上彻底投降、追求美苏合作的具体表现。
    为了改变国际学联的“苏美合作主宰世界”、联美反华的一整套错误路线，中国代表团在最后提出一项总决议草案，要求严厉谴责苏联修正主义的这条路线，而建立反对以美国为首的帝国主义的广泛的、真正的国际统一战线，支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动，支持各国人民的武装斗争、人民战争等革命的路线。这时，苏联代表团及其追随者企图根本不让会议讨论这个总决议草案，但是，遭到了多米尼加、厄瓜多尔、留法黑非洲学生联合会等代表的反对。苏联代表指使执行主席（印度人）压制讨论，立即把苏丹代表提出的所谓会议无权讨论路线问题的动议付诸表决。
    在第三项议程的发言中，中国代表表示坚决支持非洲和阿拉伯各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争。
    会议从十九日晚上到二十日上午通过了为数众多的决议。中国代表团发表总投票声明，说明中国代表团对声援亚非拉各国人民反帝斗争的决议，投了赞成票。但是决议中没有包括反对美帝国主义帮凶苏联修正主义的内容，中国代表团对此是有保留的。
    最后中国代表团发表了对这次会议的总声明，表明了中国代表团支持越南和亚非拉各国学生和人民的反帝斗争的坚定立场。总声明指出：所有要革命的人民，都通过这次会议，提高了自己的觉悟。所有革命的学生和人民应当丢掉对美帝国主义及其帮凶苏联修正主义者的幻想。他们应当反对苏联修正主义，以便胜利地继续进行反对美帝国主义的斗争。不同苏联修正主义进行斗争，就不可能把反帝斗争彻底进行到胜利。
    这次会议的进程表明，苏联修正主义集团在政治上无比虚弱，既不能否认他们自己的帮凶罪行，又不敢同别人就实质问题进行争论。因此，他们不得不求助于彻头彻尾的法西斯手段，来对付革命者的揭露和谴责。他们操纵会场，每当中国和其他革命者发言时，或者由会议主席蛮横地加以阻止，阻止不了就切断扩音器的电源，或者由他们的打手在会场上猛敲桌子，大声叫喊，跺脚起哄。他们对提出的任何真正反帝、真正革命的建议，都怕得要死，因而根本不敢讨论，有些建议弄得他们狼狈不堪，慌了手脚，便匆忙宣布休会。
    苏联修正主义集团在会上不敢交锋，还求助于会外各种无耻下流的手段，对不听他们的话的代表进行讹诈、收买。他们这伙中的一个，有一天拿了一架照相机找到某个国家的代表，说：“喂！你如果支持苏联的路线，这架照相机就是你的了。”这个倒霉的家伙得到的回答是：“收回你这玩意儿吧。我们宁肯杀头，坐牢，也不要你的照相机！”
    一些过去曾经参加过国际学联会议的代表说，过去国际学联表面上还有一点点假民主，这次连这点假民主的遮羞布也彻底脱光了。一些第一次参加国际学联会议的代表说，只这一次我们就看穿了，国际学联是个认敌为友、认友为敌的组织；是个为帝国主义服务、反对革命的中国和其它革命组织的工具。有人说，这里简直是联合国，它的前途只能是完蛋！
    是的，美帝国主义也好，它的帮凶苏联修正主义也好，它们的前途只能是完蛋。正如毛主席所说：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
