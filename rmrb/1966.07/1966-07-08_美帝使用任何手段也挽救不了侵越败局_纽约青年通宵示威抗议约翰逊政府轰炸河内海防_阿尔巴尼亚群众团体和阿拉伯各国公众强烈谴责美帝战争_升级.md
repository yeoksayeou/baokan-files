A batch of New York youth on the 6th once again held up anti-U.S. aggression in Vietnam signs in front of the office building of the U.S. mission to the United Nations, holding an all-night protest against the U.S. government's brazen bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong. The protesters angrily demanded an immediate end to this criminal war of aggression.

According to a dispatch from New China News Agency, Tirana, July 6: The trade unions, youth, and women's organizations of Albania issued separate statements condemning the U.S. imperialists' further escalation of the Vietnam War and the savage bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.

The statement of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Albania said, "The working class of Albania strongly condemns the aggressive war and savage actions of U.S. imperialism and strongly condemns the political intrigues of the Johnson administration and the demagogic propaganda of the Soviet revisionist leaders."

The statement said, "The working class of Albania once again expresses its unconditional support for the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

The statement of the Central Committee of the Albanian Youth League pointed out that the participation of the Khrushchev revisionists in the "peace talks" plot of U.S. imperialism once again shows that they are only concerned with friendship with U.S. imperialism and Soviet-American cooperation.

The Central Council of the Albanian Women's Union issued a statement representing the women of the whole of Albania, expressing great indignation at the savage bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by the American bandits.

According to a dispatch from New China News Agency, July 7: The maddened aggression and war actions of U.S. imperialism in bombing Hanoi and Haiphong have aroused the great indignation of the peoples of the Arab countries. Many mass organizations and newspapers in the Arab countries have issued statements and comments in recent days, strongly condemning this savage crime of U.S. imperialism and expressing full support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The Liberation Front of Occupied South Yemen, Cairo Office, issued a statement saying that the U.S. government's bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is "a serious provocation to the peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples of the world."

The statement reiterated that the Liberation Front of Occupied South Yemen sincerely supports the Vietnamese people's just struggle to eliminate the U.S. aggressors and achieve national liberation.

The Palestinian Trade Union Federation issued a statement saying that this savage act of aggression by the United States exposes the true face of the United States' so-called "peace appeal." The Federation decided to launch a boycott of U.S. goods to support the Vietnamese people.

The Arab Lawyers Union, the Arab Trade Union International Federation, the Lebanese Trade Union, and the Women's Rights Committee all issued statements in Cairo and Beirut, strongly condemning the U.S. savage bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.
