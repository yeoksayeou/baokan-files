Edition: 8

The emergency conference of Asian and African writers held in Beijing from June 27 to July 9, 1966, studied the current situation in Yemen (Yemen Republic, Aden colony, and East and West Aden protectorates) based on the information provided by the Yemen writers' delegation to the conference. Therefore:

1. Asian and African writers believe that the current situation in northern and southern Yemen is highly favorable for the struggling people of Yemen. The people of Yemen are fighting to liberate the occupied southern Yemen from the clutches of British imperialism, to oppose the world imperialism led by American imperialism, to oppose neo-colonialism and Arab reactionary forces, to consolidate the independence of the north, and to thoroughly liberate the occupied regions in the north—these are the two fundamental steps towards the reunification of Yemen and the liberation, democracy, and social progress of the Yemeni people. This situation is unfavorable for the forces of imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, and reactionaries.

2. Asian and African writers believe that the prerequisite for the Yemeni people to enjoy their legitimate rights to liberation, unity, and social progress is to expel British imperialism, remove its invasion bases in the occupied southern Yemen, completely drive out all foreign troops from Yemeni territory, and enable the Yemeni people to exercise their right to self-determination and independently manage their internal affairs.

3. Asian and African writers condemn the British so-called "independence in 1968" and "withdrawal of military bases in 1968" conspiracy. This conspiracy aims to deceive international public opinion and the people of the occupied southern Yemen. This conspiracy is merely a farce, and its true purpose is to hand over the administration of the occupied southern Yemen to a small group of aristocrats, feudal lords, and their lackeys. This will not change British rule but will only strengthen British rule through the despicable plan of exiting through the front door and entering through the window. Similarly, Asian and African writers condemn the British imperialist decision to hold a "People's Congress" for the occupied southern Yemen in London next month, which is a plot to deceive public opinion in Yemen and the world.

	Asian and African writers support the armed struggle of the Yemeni people against British occupation.

4. Asian and African writers condemn the series of plans by American imperialism to control northern Yemen and replace Britain in southern Yemen, and call on progressive Yemeni writers to further unite and immediately expose and smash these evil plans.

5. Asian and African writers believe that the resolutions of the United Nations and the so-called United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization cannot realize the demands and wishes of the people of the occupied southern Yemen. Asian and African writers emphasize that the United Nations, as a tool for implementing imperialist plans in the world, has no right to interfere in any matters concerning the Yemeni people until it changes its methods and is reformed. Asian and African writers believe that the only way for the Yemeni people to achieve their goals is through armed struggle, and it can only be through armed struggle.

6. Asian and African writers support all unions, progressive political groups, and revolutionary writers in Yemen in their struggle against American and British imperialism and reactionaries, for the liberation and reunification of Yemen. Asian and African writers condemn the assassination, imprisonment, exile, and surveillance of Yemeni writers, journalists, union workers, and political activists.

7. Asian and African writers call on all writers, journalists, organizations, and individuals in Asia, Africa, and the world to raise their voices, support the just struggle of the Yemeni people against American and British imperialism and reactionaries, to expel all foreign troops, dismantle military bases, and reunify Yemen.

    关于也门的决议
    一九六六年六月二十七日至七月九日于北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议，根据也门作家代表团向大会提供的情况，研究了自然也门（也门共和国，亚丁殖民地和东西亚丁保护地）目前的情况。据此：
    一、亚非作家认为也门南北部目前的形势，十分有利于全体斗争中的也门人民。也门人民正在为从英帝国主义的魔爪下解放被占领的南也门而斗争，为反对以美帝国主义为首的世界帝国主义，反对新殖民主义和阿拉伯反动势力，以巩固北方的独立，彻底解放北方被占领的地区——这是重新统一也门，实现也门人民的解放、民主和社会进步的两个基本步骤——而斗争。而这一形势不利于帝国主义、殖民主义、新殖民主义和反动派的势力。
    二、亚非作家认为，也门人民享受解放、统一和社会进步的合法权利的先决条件就是驱逐英帝国主义，撤除它在被占领的南也门的侵略基地，彻底、全部地赶走也门领土上的外国军队，使也门人民能自己行使自决权利，独立地管理自己的内部事务。
    三、亚非作家谴责英国所谓“一九六八年独立”，“一九六八年撤除军事基地”的阴谋。这一阴谋目的在于蒙骗国际公众舆论，蒙蔽被占领的南也门人民。这一阴谋仅仅是一场丑剧，其背后的目的，是要把被占领的南也门的管理权交给一小撮贵族、封建领主和他们的走狗。这丝毫不会改变英国的统治，而通过使英帝国主义继续留在被占领的南也门合法化的企图，通过执行其从大门里出去，从窗户里进来的卑鄙计划，只会加强英国的统治。同样，亚非作家谴责英帝国主义决定下月在伦敦召开被占领的南也门的“人民大会”，这一策划是企图蒙蔽世界上和也门的公众舆论。
    亚非作家支持也门人民为反对英国占领而进行的武装斗争。
    四、亚非作家谴责美帝国主义阴谋统治也门北部，并取代英国在南也门的地位的一系列计划，号召也门进步作家进一步团结起来，立即揭露和粉碎这些罪恶的计划。
    五、亚非作家认为：联合国的决议，及所谓联合国非殖民化委员会的活动，不能实现被占领的南也门人民的要求和愿望。亚非作家强调：联合国，作为在世界上执行帝国主义计划的一个工具，在它还没有改变做法、进行改组以前，无权过问也门人民的任何问题。亚非作家认为：也门人民达到自己目的的唯一道路是武装斗争，也只能是武装斗争。
    六、亚非作家支持也门的一切工会，进步政治团体和革命作家，为反对美英帝国主义和反动派，为解放和重新统一也门而进行的斗争。亚非作家谴责对也门的作家、新闻记者、工会工作者和政治活动家进行暗杀、监禁、流放和跟踪。
    七、亚非作家号召亚非及全世界的一切作家、新闻工作者、团体和个人，发出呼声，支持也门人民为反对美英帝国主义及反动派，为驱逐一切外国军队，撤销军事基地，重新统一也门所进行的正义斗争。
