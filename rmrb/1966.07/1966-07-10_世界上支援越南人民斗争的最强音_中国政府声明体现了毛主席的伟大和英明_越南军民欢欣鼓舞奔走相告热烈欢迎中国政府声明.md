The strongest voice in the world supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle
The Chinese government's statement reflects the greatness and wisdom of Chairman Mao
Vietnamese military and civilians are jubilant, spreading the news, and warmly welcoming the Chinese government's statement

Hanoi, July 9 (Xinhua) — Our correspondent reports: The strong statement issued by the Chinese government on July 3, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' brazen bombing of Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the second-largest city of Haiphong, has been warmly welcomed by the heroic Vietnamese military and civilians.

In recent days, within the anti-aircraft defense units protecting Hanoi, soldiers and officers have enthusiastically discussed the Chinese government's statement and the news of mass rallies held by the Chinese people in various places to denounce the U.S. bandits' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong. The soldiers are full of confidence and say: "The U.S. imperialists are most afraid of China. China, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, has always wholeheartedly supported us. Now, because the U.S. imperialists have escalated their aggression to a new and more serious stage, the Chinese government solemnly declares that the Chinese people's support and aid to us are even more unrestricted. This is the highest expression of the proletarian internationalism of the Chinese people, and it is a manifestation of the brotherly bond between the peoples of Vietnam and China."

After hearing the Chinese government's statement on the radio, various sectors of the people in Hanoi were overjoyed and spread the news. When newspapers such as the Vietnamese "People's Daily" and "Hanoi Capital Daily," which carried the Chinese government's statement, were delivered to factories like the Hanoi Soap Factory and the Thang Long Cigarette Factory, the workers read and said, "The Chinese people's feelings for us are the most sincere, and their support is the strongest." Some factories even broadcast the full text of the Chinese government's statement repeatedly over the factory's internal broadcast system to all workers and nearby residents.

The workers at the Gia Lam Locomotive Repair Factory said that the Chinese government's statement is the strongest voice in the world supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle. A self-defense force member, Ly Tu, who participated in the defense of Hanoi on June 29 and 30, told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent: "The Chinese government's statement greatly encourages us. The U.S. imperialists want us to give up the struggle to support the South, which is impossible. We will fight to the end. Chairman Mao said that the U.S. imperialists are paper tigers, they can be completely defeated, and the final victory will be ours."

Some southern personnel gathered in northern Vietnam also expressed to Xinhua News Agency correspondents that they were greatly encouraged by this statement, and they believe that their fellow countrymen fighting in the South will be even more encouraged. A southern cadre, Nguyen Xinh Chung, excitedly said: "The Chinese people have deep feelings for us Vietnamese people, their support is generous and selfless, their stance is firm, and their attitude is clear. We must follow the teachings of Chairman Hu, wage a long-term struggle, and thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors."

In recent days, the "Chinese Photo Exhibition" located by the Hoan Kiem Lake in the center of Hanoi has seen an unprecedented number of visitors. Many Vietnamese military and civilians stood in front of a large picture of Chairman Mao talking and firmly shaking hands with a representative of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, reluctant to leave. Many visitors excitedly discussed the Chinese government's statement of July 3 and wrote down enthusiastic words in the guestbook. Worker Tran Ngoc Du wrote: "The greatness and wisdom of Chairman Mao have been manifested in the actual actions of supporting us Vietnamese people. We believe that under the boundless enthusiasm of the great People's Republic of China, our national liberation revolutionary cause will surely achieve victory!"

    世界上支援越南人民斗争的最强音
    中国政府声明体现了毛主席的伟大和英明
    越南军民欢欣鼓舞奔走相告热烈欢迎中国政府声明
    新华社河内九日电　本社记者报道：中国政府七月三日强烈谴责美帝国主义悍然轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市和第二大城市海防市的强有力声明，受到英雄的越南军民的热烈欢迎。
    这几天，在保卫着越南首都河内市的防空部队里，指战员们热情地谈论着中国政府的声明和中国各地人民集会声讨美国强盗轰炸河内、海防罪行的消息。战士们满怀信心地说：“美帝国主义最害怕中国。中国有毛主席的英明领导，一贯全心全力支援我们。现在，由于美帝国主义把侵略战争发展到了一个新的更加严重的阶段，中国政府庄严声明说中国人民对我们的支持和援助更加不受任何约束和限制。这是中国人民最崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神的表现，是越中两国人民唇齿相依的兄弟情谊的表现。”
    河内市各界人民从广播中听到中国政府的声明后，欢欣鼓舞地奔走相告。当刊载着中国政府声明的越南《人民报》、《首都河内报》等报纸送到河内肥皂厂、升龙卷烟厂等工厂时，广大职工边读边说：“中国人民对我们的感情最真挚，支援最有力。”有的工厂还通过厂里的有线广播，向全厂职工和附近地区的人民，反复播送了中国政府声明的全文。
    嘉林机车修理厂的工人们说，中国政府的声明是世界上支援越南人民斗争的最强有力的声音。一位曾经参加过六月二十九日和三十日河内保卫战的自卫队员梁四向新华社记者说：“中国政府的声明大大鼓舞着我们。美帝国主义妄想要我们放弃支援南方的斗争，是永远办不到的。我们一定要抗战到底。毛主席说过，美帝国主义是纸老虎，它是完全可以打败的，最后胜利一定属于我们。”
    一些集结在越南北方的南方人员，也纷纷向新华社记者表示，不仅他们听了这个声明感到无限鼓舞，而且，他们相信，战斗在南方的同胞会更加受到鼓舞。一位南方集结干部阮心忠激动地说：“中国人民对我们越南人民情深义重，对我们的支援慷慨无私，立场坚定，态度鲜明。我们一定要按照胡主席的教导，长期抗战，彻底打败美国侵略者。”
    这几天，座落在河内市中心还剑湖畔的“中国图片展览”，观众空前踊跃。许多越南军民都站在毛主席同越南南方民族解放阵线代表谈话和紧紧握手的那张大幅图片前面，久久地舍不得离开。许多观众兴奋而激动地谈论着中国政府七月三日的声明，并且在留言簿上纷纷写下热烈的话。工人郑玉游写道：“毛主席的伟大，毛主席的英明，在支援我们越南人民的实际行动中已经体现出来。我们相信，在伟大的中华人民共和国的无限热情的支援下，我们的民族解放革命事业一定取得胜利！”
