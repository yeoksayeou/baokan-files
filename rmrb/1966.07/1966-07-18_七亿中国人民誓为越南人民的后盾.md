The four documents issued by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, including Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots," the order issued by Chairman Ho Chi Minh to mobilize part of the reserve forces, the decision made by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to mobilize part of the reserve forces, and the communiqué of the Supreme National Defense Council of Vietnam, express the Vietnamese people's resolute will to carry the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end. They also express the Vietnamese people's unshakable determination to fight to the finish and win. The Chinese people firmly support the heroic Vietnamese people's steadfast stand.

The U.S. imperialists are the sworn enemies of the 31 million Vietnamese people. Over the past twelve years since 1954, the U.S. aggressors have used the most barbaric means of war to slaughter tens of thousands of people in South Vietnam. In the past two years, they have extended the war to North Vietnam. Now, nearly 300,000 U.S. aggressor troops are killing people in South Vietnam every day. Thousands of bandit planes are bombing North Vietnam every day. The situation is so ruthless: either the Vietnamese people thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors, or the U.S. imperialists turn the whole of Vietnam into their colony. The struggle between the Vietnamese people and U.S. imperialism is a life-and-death struggle.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh solemnly declared, "The U.S. imperialists can send 500,000, 1 million, or even more troops to strengthen their aggression against South Vietnam. They can use thousands of planes to intensify their bombing of North Vietnam. But they will never be able to shake the iron will and determination of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation." "The war can last five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be intimidated! Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom." This is a resolute pledge made on behalf of the 31 million Vietnamese people. In the face of such a heroic nation, the only thing the U.S. aggressors can find is their own grave!

The Johnson administration's bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is a sign of its repeated defeats and desperation in the Vietnam War. It attempts to use intensified warfare to force the Vietnamese people to surrender and accept its "peace talks" deception. It is at this critical moment that those who serve the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" conspiracy are coming out in droves and becoming increasingly active. As Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: Whenever the U.S. aggressors prepare to intensify their criminal war, they play the trick of so-called "peace negotiations" to deceive world public opinion.

In the Johnson administration's criminal activities of "bombing to force peace," the Soviet revisionist leadership clique plays the role of the chief accomplice. In recent days, Moscow has been bustling with visitors, with the Indian Prime Minister and the British Prime Minister arriving one after another. There, it has become the center of U.S. "peace talks" conspiracy activities. The main slogan shouted by U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, and the Indian reactionaries is, "Immediately convene the Geneva Conference." They shout, "All parties must sit down at the negotiating table within the scope of the Geneva Agreement." People can see at a glance that this is a product of U.S.-Soviet "joint action," a thorough deception and conspiracy.

The Vietnamese issue can only be resolved according to the will and wishes of the Vietnamese people. Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out: "The United States must stop its aggression against Vietnam and withdraw all its troops and mercenary forces from Vietnam, and then peace will be immediately restored. The position of Vietnam is clear: this is the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. There is no other way!"

The whole world can see clearly that the Geneva Agreement has long been torn to shreds by the aggressive hands of U.S. imperialism and has been burned to ashes by the flames of U.S. imperialism's aggression. In the face of such facts, how can one talk about resolving the Vietnamese issue on the basis of the Geneva Agreement? To talk about the Geneva Agreement, the U.S. aggressor troops must immediately, completely, thoroughly, and cleanly withdraw from Vietnam, not leaving a single soldier. If the U.S. aggressor troops do not withdraw, there is no question of the Geneva Agreement, let alone reconvening the Geneva Conference.

The Chinese people's resolute support for the Vietnamese people's stand of carrying the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end is unshakable. Our 700 million people are the backbone of the Vietnamese people. Our vast territory is the rear base of the Vietnamese people. We have already made it clear that we will keep our word. The U.S. imperialists' aggression against Hanoi and Haiphong has further broken the boundaries of war, giving us even greater freedom to support our Vietnamese brothers. We will not allow the U.S. imperialists to continue their wanton actions. The Chinese government has solemnly declared: We will take necessary actions according to the interests and demands of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people will not be intimidated by any war threats from U.S. imperialism, nor will they be deceived by any sweet talk from U.S. imperialism. We are determined to take any risks and pay any price to stand firmly with our Vietnamese brothers and with the revolutionary people of the world, to resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people until the U.S. aggressors are thoroughly defeated.

The U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam will surely end in complete failure. The final victory will definitely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people!

### 七亿中国人民誓为越南人民的后盾

　　七亿中国人民誓为越南人民的后盾
    越南民主共和国胡志明主席《告全国同胞书》，胡志明主席颁布的关于动员一部分后备兵员的命令，越南民主共和国国会常务委员会关于动员一部分后备兵员的决定，和越南最高国防会议公报等四个文件，表达了越南人民决心把抗美救国斗争进行到底的坚强意志，表达了越南人民决战决胜的不可动摇的信念。中国人民对英雄的越南人民这种坚定的立场，表示最坚决的支持。
    美帝国主义是三千一百万越南人民不共戴天的敌人。从一九五四年以来的十二年间，美国侵略者用最野蛮的战争手段，屠杀了数十万越南南方人民，近两年来，又把战争扩大到越南北方。现在，美国近三十万侵略军，正在越南南方天天杀人。成千架强盗飞机，正在越南北方天天轰炸。事情就是这样无情，要么就是越南人民彻底打败美国侵略者，要么就是美帝国主义把整个越南变为它的殖民地。越南人民同美帝国主义的斗争，是一场你死我活的斗争。
    胡志明主席庄严宣告，美帝国主义“可以出动五十万、一百万或者更多的军队来加强对越南南方的侵略战争。他们可以使用成千架飞机来加强对越南北方的轰炸。但是，他们绝不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。”“战争可以延长五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，河内、海防和其他一些城市、企业可能被摧毁，但是越南人民是不会被吓倒的！没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。”这是代表三千一百万越南人民发出的气壮山河的誓言。在这样一个英雄民族的面前，美国侵略者所能找到的，只能是自己的坟墓！
    约翰逊政府轰炸河内、海防，是它在侵越战争中连吃败仗、走投无路的表现。它妄图用疯狂的战争升级，来迫使越南人民屈服，接受它的“和谈”骗局。正是在这个时候，那些为美帝国主义“和谈”阴谋效劳的人，纷纷出笼，大肆活跃起来。正如胡志明主席所说：美国强盗每逢准备加强罪恶战争时，就玩弄所谓“和平谈判”的骗人把戏，妄图蒙骗世界舆论。
    在约翰逊政府“以炸迫和”的罪恶活动中，苏联修正主义领导集团担当了头号帮凶的角色。这几天来，莫斯科门庭若市，印度总理、英国首相，接踵而至。那里已经成为美国“和谈”阴谋活动的中心。美帝国主义、苏联修正主义领导集团和印度反动派打出的一个主要口号是，“立即召开日内瓦会议”。它们叫嚷“必须让各方在日内瓦协议的范围内坐到谈判桌边来。”人们一眼就可以看穿，这是美苏“联合行动”的产物，是一个彻头彻尾的大骗局、大阴谋。
    越南问题只能按照越南人民的意志和愿望解决。胡志明主席指出：“美国必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须把美国军队和它的帮凶军全部撤出越南，这样和平就会立即恢复。越南的立场是明确的：这就是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。此外，没有其他办法！”
    全世界都看得清清楚楚，日内瓦协议早已被美帝国主义的侵略魔手撕得粉碎了，早已被美帝国主义所点燃的侵略烈火烧成灰烬了。在这样的事实面前，怎么能谈得上以日内瓦协议为基础来“解决”越南问题呢？要谈日内瓦协议，美国侵略军就必须立即、全部、彻底、干净地从越南撤走，一兵一卒也不得剩下。美国侵略军不撤走，就根本谈不上日内瓦协议，更谈不上重新召开日内瓦会议。
    中国人民坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底的立场是坚定不移的。我们七亿人民，是越南人民的后盾。我们辽阔的国土，是越南人民的后方。我们早就把话说在前面了，我们说了话是算数的。美帝国主义以轰炸河内和海防的侵略行动进一步打破了战争的界限，这就给予了我们更加不受任何约束地支援越南兄弟的权利。我们决不能听任美帝国主义继续胡作非为。中国政府已经郑重声明：我们将根据越南人民的利益，根据越南人民的要求，随时采取我们认为必要的行动。美帝国主义的任何战争讹诈也吓不倒中国人民，美帝国主义的种种花言巧语也迷惑不了中国人民。我们决心不怕冒任何风险，不惜付出任何代价，坚决同兄弟的越南人民站在一起，同全世界的革命人民站在一起，坚决支援越南人民的正义斗争，直到彻底打败美国侵略者。
    美帝国主义的侵越战争必将以彻底失败而告终。最后胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民！
