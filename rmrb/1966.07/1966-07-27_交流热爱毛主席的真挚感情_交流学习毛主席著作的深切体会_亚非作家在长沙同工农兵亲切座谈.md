	Participating representatives from the Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers held a cordial meeting and discussion with advanced workers, peasants, and soldiers from Hunan Province, as well as active learners of Chairman Mao's works, on July 22 in Changsha. They enthusiastically shared their genuine affection for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, as well as their insights and achievements from studying Chairman Mao's works. Some foreign friends said, "This meeting was very good. It deepened our understanding of Mao Zedong Thought and made us love it even more."

	During the group discussions, Liu Xiuying, a model worker from the Hunan Provincial Communications System and a telephone operator from the Changsha Post Office, shared her experiences of studying Chairman Mao's works with deep class feelings. Liu Xiuying was a poor child who begged for rice in the old society. She said, "Chairman Mao's books are revolutionary books that speak to our hearts. I follow Chairman Mao's teachings, thinking of myself as a telephone operator serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. To serve well, I first need to understand and familiarize myself with the users. After investigating the users, I understood their patterns and improved my work." A Syrian friend was deeply moved and said, "I believe that in China, there are more young people like you who have grown up under Chairman Mao's guidance, dedicating themselves to the people." Finally, Liu Xiuying, with boundless love and admiration for Chairman Mao, recited a poem she wrote to the foreign guests. The fiery verses expressed Liu Xiuying's deep class feelings of love for Chairman Mao from the heart, which moved the foreign guests. A representative from Madagascar said to Liu Xiuying, "You are a revolutionary, and your poem is a revolutionary poem."

	Yang Jingtang, a model worker from the Hunan Provincial Communications System and a miner from Xiangtan Manganese Mine, introduced the situation of his family studying Chairman Mao's works. He said, "Reading Chairman Mao's books made me understand that one should live to make revolution and liberate all the working people in the world." Yang Jingtang's entire family of eight became a "red family." The Asian and African friends were very happy and applauded warmly.

	The Asian and African friends listened with great interest to the speeches of Hunan Province's active learners of Chairman Mao's works, such as farmer meteorologist Duan Chunzuo and worker Zhao Jingxing from the Xiangjiang Machinery Manufacturing Company. They spoke about how studying Chairman Mao's works made them intelligent, brave, daring to scale the heights of science and technology, and daring to fight against all ghosts and snakes. Zhao Jingxing, after studying Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," armed his mind and brightened his eyes. In January 1965, after watching the film "Recruiting Soldiers," he recognized it as a poisonous weed. Overcoming his low cultural level, he wrote a critical article that was published in the "Liberation Army Daily" on May 3, firing the first shot in criticizing the bad film. He said, "Chairman Mao's words are all truths, one sentence is worth ten thousand. Mastering Mao Zedong Thought, one dares to fight against heaven, earth, imperialism, and revisionism, and dares to defeat all enemies." The Asian and African friends, after listening to their introductions, further deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's works. A friend from Swaziland said, "I used to know that Chairman Mao's works are great revolutionary truths. Today, after listening to your introductions, I further realize the great significance of studying Chairman Mao's works well. Chinese writers propose to learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to actively apply Chairman Mao's works like workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is completely correct. All writers should learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers and actively apply Chairman Mao's works like workers, peasants, and soldiers."

	During the discussion, Guo Siliang, a model militia representative and active learner of Chairman Mao's works from Hunan Province, and Yang Zaile, a soldier from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, also shared their experiences of studying Chairman Mao's works. Yang Zaile said, "Chairman Mao's books made me understand for whom to be a soldier, how to fight, and how to live. To make a revolution, one cannot be without Mao Zedong Thought for a moment." A member of the Syrian delegation, Salamah Obeid, said happily after hearing this, "Your speeches have educated and inspired us. We are happy to see that under Chairman Mao's guidance, you not only have the Chinese revolution in your minds but also the world revolution." A friend from Zimbabwe said excitedly, "When we started our revolution in Zimbabwe, some people proposed to take the parliamentary struggle path. Later, our leaders had the opportunity to read Chairman Mao's works and realized that we must use armed struggle to deal with the enemy. Based on several years of experience, we Zimbabweans and British imperialism can never compromise. The only path is to use Mao Zedong Thought to educate our people to engage in armed struggle, and thus victory will definitely be ours."

    交流热爱毛主席的真挚感情　交流学习毛主席著作的深切体会
    亚非作家在长沙同工农兵亲切座谈
    据新华社长沙二十六日电　参加亚非作家紧急会议的部分代表，二十二日在长沙和湖南省工农兵先进人物、学习毛主席著作积极分子，进行了亲切的会见和座谈。他们兴致勃勃地交流了热爱毛主席、热爱毛泽东思想的真挚感情，学习毛主席著作的心得和成就。有些外国朋友说：“这次会见很好，使我们加深了对毛泽东思想的认识，更加热爱毛泽东思想。”
    在分组进行的座谈会上，湖南省工交系统学习毛主席著作标兵、长沙市邮电局话务员刘秀英，向亚非朋友介绍了她带着深厚的阶级感情学习毛主席著作的体会。刘秀英在旧社会是个讨米的穷孩子。她说，毛主席的书是闹革命的书，都是讲的我们心里的话。我按照毛主席的教导，想到我是个话务员，话务工作是为工农兵服务的，要服务好，首先要去了解熟悉用户。经过到用户中去调查，摸清用户的规律，使工作得到了改进。一位叙利亚朋友听了很感动。他说：“我相信，在中国有更多象你这样的青年，他们都是在毛主席教导下成长起来的，全心全意为人民服务的。”最后，刘秀英怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限敬仰的心情，向外宾们朗诵了自己写的一首诗。火样的诗句，表达了刘秀英从内心发出的对毛主席无比热爱的深厚阶级感情，这种感情，激动了外宾们，马尔加什代表对刘秀英说：“你是革命的人，你的诗是革命的诗。”
    省工交系统五好职工、湘潭锰矿工人杨敬庭介绍了他自己和全家学习毛主席著作的情况。他说：“读毛主席的书使我懂得了一个人活着就要干革命，使全世界的劳动人民都能得到翻身解放。”杨敬庭全家八口人做到了全家红。亚非朋友听了，都非常高兴，热烈鼓掌。
    亚非朋友们以极大的兴趣听取了湖南省学习毛主席著作积极分子、农民气象员段春作，湘江机器制造公司飞轮小组工人左景星等学习毛主席著作后，使他们聪明、勇敢，敢于攀登科学技术高峰，敢于向一切牛鬼蛇神开火的发言。左景星学习了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》后武装了头脑，擦亮了眼睛，一九六五年一月看了电影《抓壮丁》，认识到这是大毒草，他克服了文化水平低的困难，写出了一篇批判文章，今年五月三日登在《解放军报》上，对批判这部坏电影打出了第一炮。他说：“毛主席的话，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。掌握了毛泽东思想，就敢于和天斗，和地斗，和帝国主义、修正主义斗，敢于战胜一切敌人。”亚非朋友们听了他们的介绍，进一步加深了对毛主席著作的认识。斯威士兰的朋友说：“过去我也知道毛主席著作是伟大的革命真理，今天听了你们的介绍，更使我认识到学好毛主席著作的重大意义。中国作家提出向工农兵学习，象工农兵那样活学活用毛主席著作，这完全是正确的，所有的作家都应该向工农兵学习，象工农兵那样活学活用毛主席著作。”
    在座谈会上，五好民兵代表、湖南省学习毛主席著作积极分子郭思廉和解放军某部战士、学习毛主席著作积极分子杨再烈，也介绍了自己学习毛主席著作的体会。杨再烈说：“毛主席的书使我懂得了为谁当兵，怎样战斗，怎样生活，要革命就一刻也离不开毛泽东思想。”叙利亚代表团团员萨拉马赫·奥贝德听后高兴地说：“你们的发言，教育了我们、鼓舞了我们，我们高兴地看到，你们在毛主席的教导下，脑子里不但有中国革命，还有世界革命。”津巴布韦的一位朋友听后激动地说：“我们津巴布韦开始搞革命时，有些人提出要走议会斗争的道路，后来我国的领导人有机会读到毛主席著作，才认识到必须用武装斗争来对付敌人。根据几年的经验来看，我们津巴布韦与英帝国主义之间，根本不可能妥协，唯一的道路就是要用毛泽东思想教育我国人民进行武装斗争，这样胜利就一定属于我们的。”
