The meeting considered the speech by the representative of North Kalimantan and decided:

To fully support the armed struggle of the people of North Kalimantan, and to fully support the following points proposed by the North Kalimantan representative for the revolutionary struggle of the people of North Kalimantan:

1. Take up arms to resolutely fight against American and British imperialism and the reactionary puppet regime of Rahman, and thoroughly smash the new colonialist product—“Malaysia.” Only by doing so can the people of North Kalimantan achieve genuine national liberation.

2. Mobilize the peasant masses and take root in the countryside, especially among the extremely poor peasants who make up the vast majority of the population and are urgently in need of revolution. Without taking root among the poorest peasants, it is impossible to advance according to the great strategic thought of surrounding the cities from the countryside.

3. With the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation, unite as broadly as possible all classes and nationalities that can be united, and win over more than 95% of the masses to the side of the revolutionary forces.

4. Continuously expose the so-called “democracy” of the ruling clique, which is only “democracy” within the scope that does not harm the interests of imperialism and the reactionary puppet regime in exploiting and oppressing the people. Beyond this scope, they will resort to brutal suppression.

5. Fully apply the brilliant truth of “people first,” resolutely wage a people’s war, rely on the masses, rely on the main forces, local forces, guerrillas, and militias, and foster a spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, to defeat all imperialist invaders armed with the latest weapons and nuclear teeth.

6. Revolutionary war is a struggle by the people to liberate themselves, and therefore, self-reliance must be upheld. Without self-reliance, the people cannot be tempered into heroic people, cannot persist in the long, tortuous, and arduous revolutionary struggle. Only through self-reliance can one withstand any risks and stand unshakable.

    关于北加里曼丹的决议
    会议考虑了北加里曼丹代表的发言以后：
    完全支持北加里曼丹人民的武装斗争，并完全支持北加里曼丹代表为北加里曼丹人民的革命斗争所提出的下列观点：
    一、拿起武器向美、英帝国主义和拉赫曼反动傀儡集团作坚决的斗争，彻底粉碎新殖民主义产物——“马来西亚”；只有这样做，北加里曼丹人民才能取得真正的民族解放。
    二、放手发动农民群众和扎根于农村之中，特别是放手发动和扎根于十分贫困、迫切要求革命、占人口中绝大多数的各民族农民之中。不在最贫困的各民族农民中扎根，就不可能根据农村包围城市这个伟大的战略思想前进。
    三、以工农联盟为基础，广泛地团结一切可以团结的各阶级、各民族的力量，把百分之九十五以上的群众争取到革命力量这一边来。
    四、要不断地揭露统治集团的所谓“民主”，只不过是在不损害帝国主义和反动傀儡集团的剥削和压迫人民的利益范围内的“民主”，超出了这个范围，它们就会进行残酷镇压。
    五、最大限度地发挥“人的因素第一”这个光辉的真理的作用，坚决进行人民战争，依靠人民群众，依靠主力部队、地方部队、游击队和民兵，发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的精神，打败所有用最新武器和核牙齿装备起来的帝国主义侵略军。
    六、革命战争是人民起来争取自身解放的斗争，因此，必须坚持自力更生。不自力更生，人民就不能锻炼成为英雄的人民，就不能坚持长期、曲折、艰苦的革命斗争。只有自力更生，才能经得起任何风险，而立于不败之地。
