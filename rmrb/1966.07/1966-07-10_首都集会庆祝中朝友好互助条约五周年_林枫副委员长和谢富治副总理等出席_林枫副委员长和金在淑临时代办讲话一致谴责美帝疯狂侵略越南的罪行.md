More than 1,500 people from various circles in the capital held a rally today to enthusiastically celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-North Korean Friendship and Mutual Assistance Treaty.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the Sino-North Korean Friendship Association Lin Feng, Vice Premier of the State Council Xie Fuzhi, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gao Chongmin, and others attended the meeting.

Vice Chairman Lin Feng and Acting Charge d'Affaires Kim Jae-suk of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China spoke at the meeting. They both pointed out that the signing of the Sino-North Korean Friendship and Mutual Assistance Treaty has brought the fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and North Korea, forged in blood, to a new and higher stage. It has made a tremendous contribution to safeguarding the independence of the two countries and their socialist cause, and to maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

In his speech, Lin Feng reiterated that the Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Korean people against American imperialism and will stand together with them and the revolutionary peoples of Asia and the world to fight to the end to smash all the plots of aggression and counter-revolutionary schemes hatched by American imperialism and its lackeys and running dogs.

Lin Feng strongly condemned American imperialism for violating the Korean Armistice Agreement, still occupying South Korea, and being the chief culprit obstructing Korean reunification. He said that without driving American imperialism out of South Korea, there can be no talk of achieving Korean reunification.

Lin Feng said that Chairman Mao said: "Create chaos, fail, create more chaos, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the cause of the people." American imperialism will not deviate from this logic.

Lin Feng condemned the recent frenzied bombing by American imperialism of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the second-largest city, Haiphong, pushing the war of aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious stage.

He condemned American imperialism for further using Japanese militaristic forces, creating the "Korean-Japanese Treaty," and holding the anti-communist conference in Seoul.

He said that all this is not only directed against the Vietnamese people and the Korean people but is also an important step in the strategic shift of American imperialism to the East, intensifying its military encirclement of China, and an important step in its expansion of the war of aggression in Asia and the suppression of the revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries in Asia. The outrageous actions of American imperialism fully expose it as the common enemy of the peoples of various countries in Asia.

Lin Feng condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership clique for playing the shameful role of American imperialism's lackey. He stressed that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has degenerated to the point of colluding with the lackeys and puppets of American imperialism, becoming the saboteurs of the revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries in Asia. To effectively oppose American imperialism and its lackeys, it is necessary to simultaneously oppose Soviet modern revisionism and absolutely not to engage in any "joint actions" with them. For the sake of the revolution, this principle must not be ambiguous.

He said that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, like American imperialism, is the best negative example. We believe that all true anti-imperialists, through the practice of struggle, will gradually come to understand the truth that anti-imperialism must also be anti-revisionism.

He said that to the greatest extent possible, isolate and strike the common enemy, American imperialism, all countries and peoples who have been invaded, controlled, interfered with, and bullied by the United States should unite, forming the broadest and most genuine, rather than narrow and hypocritical, international anti-American united front.

Lin Feng said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China is to further consolidate our proletarian dictatorship, uproot the roots of revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and will have an immeasurable impact on our socialist revolution and socialist construction. This cultural revolution is the great practice of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is the great practice of the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals using Mao Zedong Thought to carry the socialist revolution in our country to the end.

Kim Jae-suk, in his speech, strongly condemned American imperialism for continuing to occupy South Korea and intensifying its plots of aggression, preparing for a new war frenziedly.

He said that the new war provocations by American imperialism in South Korea are closely linked to their plot to make South Korea a major link in their military strategic system for invading Asia.

He emphasized that American imperialism is the arch-criminal of aggression and war, the fortress of world reactionaries, and the international gendarme, and is the sworn enemy of the peoples of Korea and China and all the peoples of the world.

Kim Jae-suk condemned American imperialism for bombing the residential areas and economic facilities of the peaceful people in the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the city of Haiphong, plotting to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. He also condemned American imperialism's aggressive activities in other regions of Asia.

He said that no matter what plots American imperialism hatches, they will never be able to suppress the unyielding will and determination of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting for independence and liberation.

Kim Jae-suk said that the great vitality of the friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China, established in the long struggle against Japanese imperialism, was further inherited and developed in the Korean people's struggle against the armed invasion of American imperialism in the Fatherland Liberation War.

Kim Jae-suk said that the Korean people are convinced that, as in the past, in the future, no matter what storms may come, in the struggle against imperialism, against modern revisionism and dogmatism, and for the victory of the Marxist-Leninist cause, the friendly cooperative relationship between our two peoples will continue to develop.

Today's meeting was jointly sponsored by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Sino-North Korean Friendship Association. The meeting was presided over by Zhang Ziyu, President of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. Attendees included Wang Binnan, Yang Yong, Li Qi, Li Qiang, Yang Lin, Pan Zhenwu, Wei Chuan, and other responsible persons from relevant departments and people's organizations.

Diplomats from the North Korean Embassy in China and other North Korean friends in Beijing were invited to attend the meeting.

After the meeting, the film "Maritime Cultural Work Team" and "Song of Military Reclamation" were screened.

The New China News Agency reported on July 9 that the Sino-North Korean Friendship Association sent a telegram to the North Korean-Chinese Friendship Association, extending warm congratulations to the Korean people on the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-North Korean Friendship and Mutual Assistance Treaty.

In the telegram, the Sino-North Korean Friendship Association expressed that the Chinese people will, as always, stand firmly with the fraternal Korean people, the Vietnamese people, the peoples of various countries in Asia, and all the revolutionary peoples of the world, and fight to the end to smash all the plots of aggression and counter-revolutionary schemes hatched by American imperialism and its lackeys.

    首都集会庆祝中朝友好互助条约五周年
    林枫副委员长和谢富治副总理等出席
    林枫副委员长和金在淑临时代办讲话一致谴责美帝疯狂侵略越南的罪行
    新华社九日讯　首都各界一千五百多人今天举行集会，热烈庆祝中朝友好合作互助条约签订五周年。
    人大常委会副委员长、中朝友协会长林枫，国务院副总理谢富治，政协全国委员会副主席高崇民等出席了大会。
    林枫副委员长和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办金在淑在大会上讲话，他们一致指出，中朝友好合作互助条约的签订，使中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊发展到了一个新的更高的阶段，对保障两国的独立和两国的社会主义事业、对维护亚洲和世界和平作出了巨大贡献。
    林枫在讲话中重申，中国人民坚决支持朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义的正义斗争，并将同他们以及亚洲和世界各国革命人民紧密团结在一起，为粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶和走狗所策划的一切侵略阴谋和反革命计划而奋斗到底。
    林枫强烈谴责美帝国主义破坏朝鲜停战协定，至今霸占着南朝鲜，是阻挠朝鲜统一的罪魁祸首。他说，不把美帝国主义从南朝鲜赶出去，就谈不上实现朝鲜的统一。
    林枫说，毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑”，美帝国主义也决不会违背这个逻辑。
    林枫谴责美帝国主义最近疯狂轰炸越南民主共和国的首都河内和第二大城市海防，把侵略越南的战争推进到一个新的更加严重的阶段。
    他谴责美帝国主义进一步起用日本军国主义势力，制造“韩日条约”，举行汉城反共会议。
    他说，这一切不仅针对越南人民、朝鲜人民，而且是美帝国主义战略重点东移、加紧对中国进行军事包围的重要步骤，也是它在亚洲扩大侵略战争、镇压亚洲各国人民革命运动的重要步骤。美帝国主义的这些倒行逆施，充分暴露了它是亚洲各国人民的共同敌人。
    林枫谴责苏联修正主义领导集团充当了美帝国主义帮凶的可耻角色。他强调指出，苏联修正主义领导集团已经堕落到同美帝国主义的走狗和傀儡同流合污，成为亚洲各国人民革命的破坏者。要有效地反对美帝国主义及其走狗，就必须同时反对苏联现代修正主义，绝不能同他们搞什么“联合行动”。为了革命的利益，在这个原则问题上决不能模棱两可。
    他说，苏联修正主义领导集团，象美帝国主义一样，是最好的反面教员。我们相信，一切真正反帝的人，经过斗争的实践，一定会逐步认识到反帝必须同时反修的真理。
    他说，为了最大限度地孤立和打击共同的敌人美帝国主义，所有受到美国侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家和人民应该团结起来，结成最广泛而不是狭隘的、最真实而不是虚伪的国际反美统一战线。
    林枫说，目前中国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，是为了进一步巩固我国的无产阶级专政，铲除修正主义的根子，防止资本主义的复辟，对于我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设将产生不可估量的影响。这场文化大革命，是毛泽东思想的伟大实践，是广大工、农、兵群众、革命干部、革命知识分子运用毛泽东思想把我国社会主义革命进行到底的伟大实践。
    金在淑在讲话中强烈谴责美帝国主义继续霸占着南朝鲜，加紧进行侵略阴谋活动，疯狂地准备新战争。
    他说，美帝国主义在南朝鲜推行的新战争挑衅活动，是同它们企图将南朝鲜作为在侵略亚洲的军事战略体系中的主要一环的阴谋密切相结合的。
    他强调指出，美帝国主义是侵略和战争的元凶，是世界反动派的堡垒和国际宪兵，是朝中两国人民和全世界人民不共戴天的死敌。
    金在淑谴责美帝国主义对越南民主共和国首都河内和海防市的和平居民区和经济设施进行狂轰滥炸，阴谋扩大侵越战争。他还谴责美帝国主义在亚洲其他地区的侵略活动。
    他说，美帝国主义的任何阴谋活动，都绝不能压制为独立和解放而展开正义斗争的亚非拉各国人民不屈不挠的斗志和决心。
    金在淑说，朝中两国人民在反对日本帝国主义的长期斗争中建立的友谊和团结的伟大生命力，在朝鲜人民抗击美帝国主义武装侵略的祖国解放战争中，进一步得到了继承和发展。
    金在淑说，朝鲜人民确信：和过去一样，今后不论在任何风浪中，在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和教条主义、争取马克思列宁主义事业胜利的斗争中，我们两国人民的友好合作关系将继续发展。
    今天的大会是对外文化联络委员会和中国朝鲜友好协会联合举办的。大会由对外文委主任张奚若主持。出席大会的，还有王炳南、杨勇、李琦、李强、杨琳、潘振武、魏传统等有关方面和人民团体的负责人。
    朝鲜驻华使馆外交官员和在北京的其他朝鲜朋友，应邀出席大会。
    大会结束后，放映了中国电影《海上文化工作队》和《军垦战歌》。
    新华社九日讯　中朝友好协会今天打电报给朝中友好协会，向朝鲜人民热烈祝贺中朝友好合作互助条约签订五周年。
    中朝友协在电报中表示，中国人民将坚定不移地同兄弟的朝鲜人民、越南人民、亚洲各国以及全世界革命的人民在一起，为粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗所策划的一切侵略阴谋和反革命计划而斗争到底。
