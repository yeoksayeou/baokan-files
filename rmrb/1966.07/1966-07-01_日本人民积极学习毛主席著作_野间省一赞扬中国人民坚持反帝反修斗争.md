Japanese people wholeheartedly love Chairman Mao and actively study the works of Mao Zedong.

Currently, the works of Mao Zedong and revolutionary publications from China are very popular in Japan. In Japan, "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" are sold not only in Japanese but also in Chinese and English editions. Many Japanese friends, in order to better understand Mao Zedong Thought, purchase the Chinese edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" for reading and study. Some Japanese friends, although they cannot read Chinese yet, still buy the Chinese edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and express their determination to learn Chinese so that they can read it soon.

According to several bookstore owners in Tokyo who sell Chinese publications, the "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" (both editions A and B) published by the People's Publishing House, as well as the individual volumes of Chairman Mao's philosophical works "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," are very popular and sell well in Japan. Many universities and Chinese language schools in Japan use "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" as textbooks. The Japanese bookstore Da'an, which specializes in selling Chinese publications, has compiled "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" into a collection to meet the needs of a wide range of readers, and it has been selling well. In addition to the above editions, the individual volumes of "Four Philosophical Essays by Chairman Mao" published by the People's Publishing House and "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art" published by the People's Literature Publishing House are also popular.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tokyo on the 28th, Yano Seiichi, president of the Japan Book Publishers Association and president of Bungei Shunju, recently published his impressions of his visit to China in the organ of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, "Nichi-Chu Bunka Koryu." He wrote, "The Chinese people, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with politics in command and unity, are handling domestic and international issues, which deeply moved me." He said, "The Chinese people take an uncompromising stance against American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism and are accelerating the construction of socialism in their own country."

    据新华社二十七日讯　日本人民衷心热爱毛主席并且积极学习毛泽东著作。
    目前，毛泽东著作和中国的革命书刊在日本极为畅销。在日本出售的《毛泽东选集》，除日文版外，还有中文版和英文版。有不少日本朋友为了能够更加准确地领会毛泽东思想，购买了《毛泽东选集》中文版来阅读和学习。有的日本朋友虽然现在还看不懂中文，但是，他们也买下了《毛泽东选集》中文版，并且表示要努力学习中文，以便在短期内能够阅读。
    据东京几家经售中文书刊的书店主人说，人民出版社出版的《毛泽东著作选读》甲种本和乙种本，毛主席的哲学名著《实践论》和《矛盾论》的单行本，在日本都极受欢迎，甚为畅销。日本的不少大学和中国语讲习会把《实践论》和《矛盾论》当作教科书使用。专门经售中国书刊的日本大安书店为了满足广大读者的需要，特地把《实践论》和《矛盾论》汇编成集，销路一直很好。除以上版本外，人民出版社出版的《毛主席的四篇哲学论文》和人民文学出版社出版的《毛泽东论文学和艺术》等中文单行本也颇为畅销。
    据新华社东京二十八日电　日本书籍出版协会会长、《讲谈社》社长野间省一，最近在日本中国文化交流协会机关刊物《日中文化交流》上发表访华观感。他写道，中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，政治挂帅，团结一致，处理国内和国际问题，使他“深受感动”。他说，中国人民对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义“采取不妥协的态度，正在加快步伐从事本国的社会主义建设”。
