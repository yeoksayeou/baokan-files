The U.S. Empire and its accomplices are collaborating on a new "peace talk" conspiracy. Soviet leaders are serving the U.S. and betraying the Vietnamese people. The Soviet, British, Indian, and Canadian governments are hurriedly planning to hold the Geneva Conference, fully catering to the needs of the U.S. Empire.

New China News Agency, July 10th: Our reporter reports: The Johnson administration, while continuously bombing Hanoi and Haiphong and crazily expanding the war in Vietnam, is also instigating its lackeys and accomplices to push for "peace talks." This fully exposes the Johnson administration's conspiracy of "bombing to force talks," and also exposes the ugly faces of the accomplices who are serving this U.S. conspiracy.

Those who are actively running around for the Johnson administration's conspiracy of "bombing to force talks" are still the joint venture of the imperialist, Soviet revisionist leadership, and the Indian reactionaries, with Moscow as the center of activity. One of their main slogans this time is the so-called "immediate convening of the Geneva Conference," that is, on the basis of the 1954 Geneva Agreement, which has been completely destroyed by the U.S., to discuss the "solution" to the Vietnamese problem.

After the Johnson administration began bombing Hanoi and Haiphong on June 29th, the British Labour Party government announced on July 6th that British Prime Minister Wilson, who had just visited the Soviet Union in February, would visit the Soviet Union again from July 16th to 18th to discuss the Vietnamese situation with Soviet Premier Kosygin. British Foreign Secretary Stewart said in the House of Commons on July 7th that as the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, Britain and the Soviet Union have a "heavy responsibility to promote negotiations," and Wilson would make every effort to urge the Soviet Union to "urgently need negotiations" during his visit to the Soviet Union. Stewart also reiterated that talks come first and troops withdraw later, but in reality, he is playing a deceitful trick of only talking and not withdrawing. He emphasized, "Conceding to all the demands of the communists is definitely not the way to achieve peace." This fully exposes the essence of the new "peace talk" trick they are plotting. It is reported that after Wilson ends his visit to the Soviet Union, he will visit the United States on July 29th.

On the same day (July 7th), Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi announced that she would go to the Soviet Union to discuss the Vietnamese problem with Kosygin and "do everything possible to achieve peace in Vietnam." She further proposed that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference should immediately convene the Geneva Conference. She, following the tune of Washington, loudly propagandized that there is no other way except "peacefully resolving the Vietnamese conflict," and "all parties must sit at the negotiating table within the scope of the Geneva Agreement," and so on. It is reported that a week before Gandhi publicly proposed this suggestion, she had already conveyed this suggestion to Washington.

After Gandhi made this speech, she immediately boarded a plane to Cairo; afterward, she would also go to Belgrade and Moscow. The Indian News Agency reported on July 8th: Gandhi would discuss her proposal with Tito and Kosygin and others. ... She would personally appeal to the Soviet Premier to help convene the Geneva Conference.

Washington immediately expressed "enthusiastic" "welcome" to Wilson's Moscow trip and Gandhi's "proposal." The U.S. State Department spokesman, Wright, issued a statement on July 7th saying: "Wilson's concern for the peaceful resolution of the Vietnamese conflict is well known. If he maintains this concern during his visit to Moscow, no one will be surprised," "his efforts will definitely receive our support." Wright did not even deny that Wilson's visit to the Soviet Union was a "joint action" of Britain and the U.S. on the Vietnamese issue.

On July 8th, Wright issued another statement, "welcoming Gandhi's proposal to convene (the Geneva) conference." Wright bluntly exposed the U.S. background of this "proposal." He said that the U.S. "has long supported the reconvening of the Geneva Conference to seek a solution to the Vietnamese problem on the basis of the 1954 and 1962 Geneva Agreements."

On July 9th, Rusk, after returning to Washington from his Asian trip, said that he would be "happy to promote the realization" of the Indian Prime Minister's proposal.

It is significant that, at this time when the so-called "peace talks" based on the Geneva Agreement are making a lot of noise, the Soviet revisionist leadership claims that it still "strictly adheres to the Geneva Agreement." According to Gandhi's speech before she left for Cairo on July 7th, when the Indian Foreign Ministry conveyed this proposal to the representatives of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the members of the International Control Commission for Vietnam, their reaction "was not unfavorable."

On July 8th, Canadian Foreign Minister Martin also revealed that he had discussed the issue of convening the Geneva Conference with the current Soviet Deputy Premier Polyansky, who is active in Canada, three days before Gandhi proposed this proposal (July 4th); on July 11th, they would hold another meeting.

According to Canadian newspapers, Polyansky, on his way from British Columbia to Montreal on July 3rd, had made a statement to reporters, urging the Canadian government to "take active measures to stop (the Vietnamese) war." At the banquet held by Canadian Foreign Minister Martin for him on June 28th, after Martin defended the U.S. policy of invading Vietnam, he actually advocated that it was important to "join hands" and strive for peace and friendship.

All of this fully shows that a new Munich conspiracy closely coordinated with the Johnson administration's war blackmail crimes is being plotted, and in this great conspiracy, the Soviet revisionist leadership is playing the most despicable and shameful role of betraying the Vietnamese people.

It is worth noting that while the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries are collaborating to push the "peace talk" trick, U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara held a two-day "top-secret military meeting" in Honolulu on July 7th with the Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Armed Forces in the Pacific, Sharp, to discuss "all aspects" of expanding the war in Vietnam. At the same time, Washington also announced that U.S. Secretary of the Navy, Nitze, would visit South Vietnam from July 9th to 17th to inspect the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps in Vietnam and the Seventh Fleet, and plot new war conspiracies.

The heroic Vietnamese people have once again shown that they are neither intimidated by bombs and war escalation nor deceived by any conspiracy. The Geneva Agreement has long been torn to pieces by the Johnson administration's war actions and no longer exists. Its conspiracy to use this broken sign to achieve its purpose of invading Vietnam will not succeed, and the result will only be another failure of the U.S. aggressors and the exposure of the faces of the demons who serve them to the world. All people who resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism and support the struggle of the Vietnamese people will not be fooled by these demons.

　　美帝及其帮凶合伙大搞“和谈”新阴谋  苏联领导为美奔走效劳出卖越南人民
　　苏英印加等国加紧策划召开日内瓦会议完全迎合美帝需要
    新华社十日讯　本社记者报道：约翰逊政府在连续轰炸河内、海防，疯狂扩大侵越战争的同时，又策动它的娄罗和帮凶出面大搞“和谈”阴谋。这就彻底暴露了约翰逊政府“以炸迫和”的阴谋，同时也暴露了为美国这个阴谋效劳的帮凶们的丑恶面目。
    正在为约翰逊政府“以炸迫和”阴谋积极奔走的，仍然是帝国主义、苏联修正主义领导集团和印度反动派的合股公司，而活动的中心则在莫斯科。它们这次活动的一个主要口号是所谓“立即召开日内瓦会议”，即在已被美国彻底破坏的一九五四年日内瓦协议的基础上，讨论越南问题的“解决办法”。
    在约翰逊政府从六月二十九日开始对河内和海防进行狂轰滥炸之后，英国工党政府六日宣布，刚刚在今年二月去过苏联的英国首相威尔逊，将在七月十六日到十八日再次访苏，同苏联部长会议主席柯西金讨论越南局势等问题。英国外交大臣斯图尔特七日在下院声称，作为日内瓦会议两主席的英国和苏联，负有“促进谈判的沉重义务”，威尔逊访苏时将竭力向苏联申诉“迫切需要谈判”。斯图尔特还重申先谈判、后撤军，而实际上是玩弄只谈不撤的欺骗把戏。他强调说，“向共产党的一切要求让步是决不能实现和平的”。这就完全暴露了他们正在策划的“和谈”新骗局的实质。据报道，威尔逊在结束访苏后，将于七月二十九日访美。
    同一天（七日），印度总理甘地夫人宣布要去苏联同柯西金讨论越南问题，“尽一切努力使越南实现和平”。她并且在广播讲话中进一步提出由日内瓦会议两主席立即召开日内瓦会议的“创议”。她按照华盛顿的调子，大肆宣传除了“和平解决越南冲突外”，别无他途，“必须让各方在日内瓦协议的范围内坐到谈判桌边来”等等。据报道，甘地夫人在公开提出这个建议的一周前，已经把这个建议告诉了华盛顿。
    甘地夫人在发表这个讲话后即乘飞机去开罗；之后，她还将去贝尔格莱德和莫斯科。印度报业托辣斯八日报道说：甘地夫人将同铁托和柯西金等讨论她的建议。……她将亲自呼吁苏联总理帮助召开日内瓦会议。
    华盛顿对威尔逊的莫斯科之行和甘地夫人提出的“建议”，迅即表示了热烈的“欢迎”。美国国务院发言人赖特七日发表声明说：“威尔逊首相之关心和平解决越南冲突是尽人皆知的。如果他在莫斯科时继续保持这种关心，人们不会感到意外”，“他的努力肯定将获得我们的赞同”。赖特甚至并不否认，威尔逊访苏是英美在越南问题上的一项“共同行动”。
    八日，赖特又发表声明，“欢迎甘地总理关于召开（日内瓦）会议的主张”。赖特一语道破了这个“建议”的美国背景。他说，美国“早就支持重新召开日内瓦会议，以求在一九五四年和一九六二年日内瓦协议基础上实现（越南问题的）解决”。
    九日，腊斯克在结束了他的亚洲之行回到华盛顿时说，对印度总理的建议，他将“乐于促使其实现”。
    意味深长的是，正在这样一片所谓根据日内瓦协议进行“和谈”的喧嚷声甚嚣尘上的时候，苏联修正主义领导集团声称它仍然“恪守日内瓦协议”。据甘地夫人在七日动身去开罗前发表谈话时透露，在印度外交部把她的这项建议通知苏联、英国的代表和越南问题国际监督委员会的委员们时，他们的反应“并不是不利的”。
    八日，加拿大外长马丁也透露，他早在甘地夫人提出这项建议前三天（七月四日）就曾同目前正在加拿大活动的苏联部长会议第一副主席波利扬斯基讨论过召开日内瓦会议的问题；十一日，他们还将再次举行会谈。
    据加拿大报纸报道，波利扬斯基三日从英属哥伦比亚前往蒙特利尔途中，曾对记者发表谈话，要求加拿大政府“采取积极措施，来制止（越南）这场战争”。而在六月二十八日加拿大外长马丁为他举行的宴会上，在马丁为美国侵略越南的政策辩护后，他竟然鼓吹什么“重要的是‘携起手来’，为和平和友谊而努力”。
    这一切充分表明，一个同约翰逊政府的战争讹诈罪行密切配合的新的慕尼黑大阴谋正在策划中，而在这个大阴谋中，苏联修正主义领导集团扮演了出卖越南人民的最卑鄙、最可耻的主要角色。
    值得注意的是，在帝、修、反合伙大搞“和谈”骗局的同时，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉在七日到檀香山同太平洋美国武装部队总司令夏普举行了两天的“绝密军事会议”，讨论扩大侵越战争的“一切方面”。同时，华盛顿还宣布，美国海军部长尼采将在九日到十七日访问南越，视察侵越美海军和海军陆战队以及第七舰队，策划新的战争阴谋。
    英雄的越南人民已经再次表明，他们既不是炸弹和战争升级所能吓倒的，也不是任何阴谋骗局所能骗得了的。日内瓦协议早已被约翰逊政府的战争行动撕得粉碎，根本不存在了。它想利用这块破招牌实现侵越目的的阴谋，决不会得逞，结果只能是美国侵略者的又一次失败和为它效劳的牛鬼蛇神的面目暴露于世人面前。一切坚决反对美帝国主义和支持越南人民斗争的人民，决不会上这些魔鬼的当。
