The joyous news of our great leader Chairman Mao swimming in the Yangtze has swiftly spread across the nation, stirring an unprecedented wave of enthusiasm among the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces.

"Long live Chairman Mao forever!" "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Cheers echoed from the frontlines of the border and coastal defenses, from the decks of ships, from airfields and barracks, resonating through the skies and seas, and across the land.

"Chairman Mao, we will forever follow you!" "Study Chairman Mao's great works and revolutionary practices, and advance bravely along the revolutionary path blazed by Chairman Mao!"

Statements of resolve, pledges, and banners appeared on artillery positions, high-altitude outposts, naval and air force bases, and along the ten-thousand-li coastal and border defenses.

The news spread, and the entire army was filled with joy, with everyone's spirits soaring. They rushed to share the news: Our great leader Chairman Mao is in such good health, which is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and the greatest happiness for the revolutionary people of the world!

The news reached a certain island on the coastal defense line. The soldiers of the Third Company of a certain unit immediately held high a portrait of Chairman Mao and gathered to listen to the broadcast of Chairman Mao swimming in the Yangtze. After listening, the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" drowned out the roaring waves. Huang Shengyou, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works from a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region, heard the joyous news of Chairman Mao swimming in the Yangtze and immediately sang "The East Is Red" with all his heart. On July 16, Liu Xinfa, a platoon leader from a certain unit of the Wuhan Military Region, who personally saw Chairman Mao swimming in the Yangtze, reported to his comrades with deep emotion: "I saw Chairman Mao swimming in the Yangtze. Chairman Mao's face was radiant, and his health was excellent!" At this, all the soldiers in the platoon jumped for joy.

In the units where Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Liu Yingjun once served, many soldiers held discussions after hearing the news, filled with excitement. Battle hero Mai Xiande, seeing the photo and news of Chairman Mao swimming in the Yangtze in the newspaper, was extremely excited and eagerly asked a nurse to read it to him. When she read, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts," he shouted passionately, "Long live Chairman Mao!" After reading, Mai Xiande wrote in his notebook: "The joyous news of Chairman Mao swimming in the Yangtze inspires the heart! Chairman Mao is so healthy, which is our greatest happiness!"

Chairman Mao's great revolutionary spirit of swimming in the Yangtze has brought immense inspiration to all the soldiers, adding boundless confidence and strength. Ji Ruixian, a reconnaissance hero who has crossed the sea dozens of times to enemy-occupied islands to capture "tongues" and gather intelligence, said, "We are the vanguard guarding the coastal frontlines. We must take Chairman Mao's fearless revolutionary spirit as our example, fearing neither heaven nor earth, and annihilate all enemies who dare to invade." A soldier from a certain artillery company of the Beijing Military Region, who was awarded a third-class merit for his actions in the "Sea Storm," said, "We are Chairman Mao's soldiers. We must dare to climb mountains of knives and walk through fires, fearing no storms or waves, and advance bravely along the revolutionary path blazed by Chairman Mao, carrying out the Chinese and world revolution to the end." A reconnaissance company of a certain unit of the Nanjing Military Region, which was about to set out for swimming training in the rivers and lakes, took the joyous news of Chairman Mao swimming in the Yangtze as the highest mobilization order. The entire company was filled with fighting spirit, determined to set out immediately to confront the waves. A certain regiment of the Kunming Military Region, which enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "go to the great rivers and seas for training" two years ago, had the entire regiment cross the Jinsha River. This time, upon hearing the joyous news of Chairman Mao swimming in the Yangtze, eleven companies of officers and soldiers swam across the Jinsha River on the same day.

The broad masses of soldiers in various units further launched a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and learning from Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practices. They said, "We must learn Chairman Mao's great revolutionary theories and also learn from Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practices. Chairman Mao's practices in decades of revolutionary struggles are all examples for our actions."

    据新华社二十六日讯　我国各族人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席畅游长江的喜讯，风快传遍全国，在中国人民解放军陆海空军各部队中，激起了一片空前热烈的欢腾。
    “毛主席万寿无疆！”“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
    欢呼声从边防、海防前哨响起，从舰艇甲板响起，从机场、营房响起，响彻天空和海洋，响彻祖国大地。
    “毛主席，我们永远跟着您！”“学习毛主席的伟大著作和伟大革命实践，沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道奋勇前进！”
    决心书、保证书、标语板，出现在炮兵阵地，出现在高原哨所，出现在海空军基地，出现在万里海防边防前线……。
    喜讯传开，全军上下，一片欢腾，人人精神振奋，奔走相告：我们伟大的领袖毛主席身体这样健康，真是我们全中国人民的最大幸福，全世界革命人民的最大幸福！喜讯传到海防前哨某岛，某部三连指战员，当即高高地举着毛主席象，围坐在一起倾听广播毛主席畅游长江的消息。听完以后，“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声压倒了汹涌澎湃的海涛声。广州部队某部学习毛主席著作积极分子黄声友，听到毛主席畅游长江的喜讯，立刻纵情高唱《东方红》。七月十六日亲眼看到毛主席畅游长江的武汉部队某部排长刘新发，怀着感动的心情，向同志们报告：“我看到毛主席畅游长江了。毛主席红光满面，身体非常健康！”这时，全排战士都高兴得欢呼跳跃起来。在雷锋、王杰、刘英俊生前所在的部队，许多指战员听到喜讯后，都激动地举行了座谈。战斗英雄麦贤得在报纸上看到毛主席畅游长江的照片和消息，极为兴奋，迫不及待地请护士给他朗读。当读到“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳”时，他满怀激情地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”读完后，麦贤得在笔记本上写道：“毛主席畅游长江的喜讯，振奋人心！毛主席这样健康，是我们最大的幸福！”
    毛主席畅游长江的伟大革命气魄，给全军指战员带来了巨大的鼓舞，增添了无限的信心和力量。曾几十次渡海到敌占岛屿抓“舌头”、摸敌情的侦察英雄纪瑞瑄说，我们是守卫在海防前哨的尖兵，一定要以毛主席这种大无畏的革命精神为榜样，天不怕，地不怕，把一切胆敢来犯的敌人消灭光。在“战海啸”中荣立三等功的北京部队某部炮连战士说，我们是毛主席的战士，一定要刀山敢上，火海敢下，不怕任何狂风巨浪，在毛主席开辟的革命航道上奋勇前进，将中国和世界革命进行到底。正在整装待发到大江大湖里去进行游泳训练的南京部队某部侦察连，把毛主席畅游长江的喜讯，当作最高的动员令，全连人员斗志昂扬，决心马上出发去迎战风浪。昆明部队某团，两年前热烈响应毛主席“到大江大海去锻炼”的伟大号召，全团横渡过金沙江，这次听到毛主席畅游长江的喜讯，当天就有十一个连的干部战士泅渡了金沙江。
    各部队广大指战员进一步掀起了活学活用毛主席著作和学习毛主席伟大革命实践的热潮。他们说，我们要学习毛主席的伟大革命理论，也要学习毛主席的伟大革命实践。毛主席在几十年革命斗争中的实践，无一不是我们行动的典范。
