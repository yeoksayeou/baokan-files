Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has illuminated the path for the proletarian cultural revolution. Active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the Shenyang Military Region and artists from the Hubei Experimental Opera Troupe have expressed their boundless love, faith, and admiration for this epoch-making document. They have resolved to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the anti-party, anti-socialist literary and artistic black line, and establish a new proletarian art.

	Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 6th - After the republication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the active learners of Chairman Mao's works and the broad masses of soldiers in the Shenyang Military Region, like the entire army, held meetings with excitement. They discussed the great significance of the republication of the "Talks" and denounced the anti-party, anti-socialist crimes of Zhou Yang, the "ancestor" of the literary and artistic black line. In their speeches, they pointed out that Chairman Mao's brilliant work has illuminated the path for our country's proletarian cultural revolution and sounded the charge for a total offensive against the anti-party, anti-socialist black line. We must use the "Talks" as a powerful ideological weapon to thoroughly smash the anti-party clique led by Zhou Yang, sweep away all ghosts and monsters, and carry the cultural revolution to the end.

	Using Chairman Mao's "Talks" as a weapon, launch a total offensive against the lair of the bourgeois black line

	Deputy Political Director of a certain regiment, Liao Chujiang, said: Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has illuminated the path for the proletarian cultural revolution. As long as we firmly grasp this powerful ideological weapon, we will surely uproot the anti-party, anti-socialist black line in the cultural realm. The republication of the "Talks" marks the beginning of a new stage in the cultural revolution. With this most complete, most thorough, and most correct Marxist-Leninist literary line, we will surely smash the counter-revolutionary plot of the bourgeoisie represented by Zhou Yang on the literary and artistic front.

	Deputy Director of the Organization Department of a certain unit, Special Grade Combat Hero Jia Shunyi, said: The republication of Chairman Mao's "Talks" is a severe blow to those stubborn bourgeois "authorities," smashing open the lair of the anti-party, anti-socialist clique. Zhou Yang, this old hand at anti-party activities, no matter how arrogant he is, we will surely pull him down from his horse and trample him underfoot. With the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with the "Talks" as a powerful spiritual weapon, their spines are stiffer, their eyes are clearer, fearing neither heaven nor earth. No matter how stubborn the fortresses, we will blow them to smithereens.

	Deputy Political Instructor of a certain platoon, Wang Daoming, said: The republication of the "Talks" is a new battle command and deployment issued to us. We will surely expose the true colors of the black clique led by Zhou Yang with the brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao's "Talks." In the 1930s, they feared Lu Xun to death and hated him to death; now they fear and hate the workers and peasants who have grasped Mao Zedong Thought to death, wanting to kick them aside to dominate the cultural and historical stage and realize their plot of capitalist restoration. As Chairman Mao said in the "Talks": "Your way is no good, the proletariat cannot accommodate you; if we accommodate you, it is actually accommodating the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and there is the danger of party and national destruction." We must shut the door and beat the dogs, beat them down. We workers and peasants, armed with the "Talks" as a powerful ideological weapon, are like Sun Wukong with a thousand-catty cudgel, beating all ghosts and monsters into a state of withered flowers and broken spirits.

	Deputy Political Instructor of the Red Ninth Company of a certain unit, Qiao Yunqi, said: Chairman Mao, in this epoch-making important speech delivered 24 years ago, systematically criticized the bourgeois literary line of the 1930s represented by Zhou Yang. Zhou Yang, the "ancestor" of the anti-revolutionary black clique in the literary world, like all reactionaries, has not changed his reactionary nature. He uses more concealed and cunning methods to control the literary world, fiercely attacking the great Mao Zedong Thought. For many years, they have collaborated with domestic and foreign class enemies to launch a struggle against us. Now is the time to settle accounts with the counter-revolutionary crimes of Zhou Yang and uproot this black root. We must use the "Talks" as the sharpest ideological weapon, concentrating our firepower on the lair of the black clique, fighting a battle of annihilation.

	Completely eliminate Zhou Yang's revisionist literary black line and establish new proletarian literature and art

	The current platoon leader of the platoon where Lei Feng once served, Qu Jianwen, said: Chairman Mao's "Talks" is indeed a mirror that reveals monsters. Reviewing the "Talks," we can see what kind of monster Zhou Yang is. From the 1930s to the 1960s, he has stubbornly insisted on the revisionist literary black line, opposing Chairman Mao's literary line. This time, pulling him out again shows the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. We workers and peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought as a mirror that reveals monsters, Zhou Yang and his gang will not be able to escape.

	Wang Daoming said: Zhou Yang advocates "literature and art for the whole people," which is feudal, capitalist, and revisionist reactionary literature and art. He waves the black flag of "literature and art for the whole people" to peddle revisionist black goods, paving the way for Khrushchev's revisionist "whole people's party" and "whole people's state." Chairman Mao teaches us: "You are a bourgeois artist, you sing the praises of the bourgeoisie; you are a proletarian artist, you sing the praises of the proletariat and the laboring people: the two must be one or the other." Zhou Yang maliciously slanders the fundamental direction of literature and art serving the proletariat, attempting to use bourgeois ideology to transform and dominate us, which is absolutely impossible. Zhou Yang and his gang sing the praises of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, while we insist on singing the praises of the great Party, the great leader Chairman Mao, and the great socialist cause. We must let the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat occupy all ideological positions. Our company has monthly performances, songs everywhere, activities on holidays, and every activity serves proletarian politics. All the programs we self-write, self-perform, and self-sing to propagate Mao Zedong Thought are the most inspiring, the most educational, and the most problem-solving. The bourgeois goods peddled by Zhou Yang, we not only do not need but also firmly oppose!

	Female cook of a certain platoon, Wang Yifeng, said: Zhou Yang absurdly says, "The art of any class is not only for its own class but for all classes, arousing the resonance of all people." Chairman Mao teaches us: "In a class society, there is only class-characterized humanity, and there is no such thing as super-class humanity. We advocate proletarian humanity, the humanity of the people, while the landlord and bourgeoisie advocate the humanity of the landlord and bourgeoisie, but they do not say so in words, instead saying it becomes the only humanity." Using Chairman Mao's words to illuminate, one can immediately see through Zhou Yang's stubborn opposition to the class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, attempting to cancel the class character of revolutionary literature and art and replace it with the class character of the bourgeoisie. He attempts to use the reactionary black goods produced under his command, such as "Stage Sisters," "Thousand Miles Against the Wind," and "The Enemy at the Gate," to corrupt us, achieving their despicable goal of seizing political power from the people.

	Cook of a certain platoon, Zhang Dao, said: Grasping Chairman Mao's "Talks," our eyes are bright, and our noses are keen. We can clearly distinguish between flowers and weeds. The anti-party, anti-socialist black clique in the cultural world led by Zhou Yang will not escape. All the weeds produced by this black clique must be eradicated. If it is a flower, we will guard it; if it is a weed, we will uproot it.

	Firmly following Chairman Mao's teachings, workers and peasants must grasp cultural power

	Liao Chujiang said: Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is the theoretical weapon for the people of our country, and indeed the world, to truly grasp cultural power. Culture was originally created by the laboring people but has long been monopolized by the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie, used to oppress and enslave us. This cultural revolution, led by Chairman Mao, allows us to seize cultural power. We must and will grasp cultural power. Chairman Mao said: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." We will not only be able to thoroughly drive the "ancestor" of the black clique from the cultural stage but also be able to stride onto the cultural stage with heads held high. Before I enlisted, I only studied for three years. On this July 1st, with boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao, I wrote a poem for the newspaper for the first time. I have endless words in my heart. The facts prove that the broad masses of workers and peasants can become the masters of culture. We must firmly grasp the gun and the pen, using these "two tools" to defend the proletarian dictatorship and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

	Wang Daoming said: Revolutionary soldiers love the great Party and the great leader Chairman Mao the most. I and my fellow artists in the company's art group have worked for several months to decorate the "Red Army Room," painting the routes our company marched during the Long March, painting heroes who bravely fought with the enemy in bayonet combat, and painting how we are educated by Mao Zedong Thought. In winter, when our hands are frozen, we go out to practice bayonet combat and then come back to paint, sometimes working all night. But in school, under the command of Zhou Yang's black line, we were only asked to copy portraits of beauties and birds, attempting to cultivate us into successors of the bourgeoisie. This is the great plot of Zhou Yang and his gang. With the "Talks" as our compass, and with class struggle practice, we will surely be able to paint the newest and most beautiful pictures in the world.

	Wang Yifeng said: Chairman Mao's "Talks" greatly boosted our confidence in grasping cultural power. Recently, I watched the Shenyang Music Week where workers, peasants, and soldiers sang and performed to praise the Party and Chairman Mao. Especially the famous active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Li Suwen, personally took the stage to lead the singing, passionately praising Chairman Mao. I was full of energy on the stage, feeling that shouting "Long live Chairman Mao" a hundred times could not express what I wanted to say. Our class used to have poor cultural activities, but during the cultural revolution, after learning the "Talks," we realized that this is a life-and-death class struggle to seize power and souls. Singing a revolutionary song or performing a revolutionary program is propagating Mao Zedong Thought and firing a bullet at the anti-party, anti-socialist black clique. Everyone took action, self-writing and self-performing songs to praise the great leader Chairman Mao. New soldier Zhao Xianlan, despite the furnace heat drying his throat, learned to sing new songs praising the cultural revolution while cooking. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would treat the "Talks" as the highest directive, believing it without doubt, and resolutely following it to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 6th - Recently, artists from the Hubei Experimental Opera Troupe held a symposium to celebrate the republication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." They re-read Chairman Mao's instructions, expressing boundless love, faith, and admiration for this epoch-making important document; and intense indignation towards the bourgeoisie, revisionism, and the so-called literary black line of the 1930s. They resolved to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

	For more than a decade, this opera troupe has been a battleground for the sharp struggle between the proletarian literary red line and the bourgeois literary black line, and the struggle between peaceful evolution and anti-peaceful evolution. In this struggle, they deeply felt that whenever they paid more attention to studying and implementing Chairman Mao's works and seriously carrying out Mao Zedong's literary thoughts, excellent operas like "Red Guards on the Honghu Lake" were produced, and the troupe presented a new situation, winning the enthusiastic support of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Whenever they were more influenced by the impact of the anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought literary black line represented by Zhou Yang, the troupe achieved nothing, became detached from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and was opposed by the masses. From their personal experiences, they deeply understood that Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is the eternal red sun in the literary world, the sharp weapon, the family treasure, and the lifeline of the literary world. Every sentence and every point in the "Talks" is the work guideline for the literary world. Everyone expressed that they would study Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, do revolutionary work for a lifetime, and transform their thoughts for a lifetime, treating Chairman Mao's works and the "Talks" as the highest directive for literary workers, becoming steadfast proletarian literary warriors.

	The process of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers is a process of class struggle

	Chairman Mao said in the "Talks": "Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by workers, peasants, and soldiers." Participants in the symposium, based on their experiences and lessons from more than a decade of practice, felt that serving whom is a matter of stance, a matter of revolution or not. Actor Wang Yuzhen and Xia Kuiqin said: Chairman Mao taught us to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, but sometimes we did not implement it decisively and thoroughly. The facts of more than a decade tell us that whenever we listened to Chairman Mao's words and acted according to his words, sincerely and wholeheartedly serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, our direction was clear, our path was correct, we broke superstitions, and like young calves, we were fearless, full of energy and spirit, creating excellent works like "Red Guards on the Honghu Lake" that are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers. Conversely, sometimes we did not listen to Chairman Mao's words and did not act according to his words, becoming detached from workers, peasants, and soldiers, temporarily losing our direction, and being opposed by workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	Participants in the symposium believed: The process of insisting on serving workers, peasants, and soldiers is a process of class struggle, a process of struggle between the proletarian red line and the bourgeois black line. The question of serving whom has been a year-round struggle within the troupe, sometimes extremely fierce. Playwright Mei Shaoshan said that the black clique of Zhou Yang had spared no effort to advocate the troupe's realization of so-called "professionalization, standardization, and theaterization," with extremely malicious intentions. They wanted us not to be revolutionary literary workers and not to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. Their anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought literary black line, although it did not subdue us, still had an impact, even causing some difficulties in the work. Despite this, because we listened to the Party and Chairman Mao's words, focused on class struggle, we still resisted the black wind blown by Zhou Yang and his black clique, insisting on the fundamental direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	The party branch secretary Liu Enxian and deputy secretary Guo Zhiying systematically recalled the history of class struggle within the troupe on the issue of serving whom over the past few years. They said that after the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, we have always insisted on performing revolutionary modern plays. However, during the period of 1961 and 1962, due to the impact and influence of the black line in the literary world, the troupe produced strange light music, some people pursued personal fame and gain, were unwilling to go deep into workers, peasants, and soldiers, and some people saw that others were performing "The Peony Pavilion" and "The Injustice to Dou E," and were also eager to try. This shows that class struggle is sometimes hidden and sometimes repeated; each victory in the struggle brings us closer to Mao Zedong Thought. Today, we are re-learning the "Talks," and we must be more resolute in studying and implementing Mao Zedong's works, treating Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive. Only in this way can our literary work have a clear direction and correct path, can we create and make progress.

	The rich life of the people is the only source of literature and art

	Chairman Mao said: "The life of the people is rich in literary and artistic raw materials, which are natural forms, rough forms, but also the most vivid, most abundant, and most fundamental things; in this sense, they make all literature and art pale in comparison, and they are the inexhaustible and endless source of all literature and art." The troupe members felt from their practice that only by following Chairman Mao's teachings, going deep into life, and participating in the people's revolutionary struggle, can we create plays that workers, peasants, and soldiers like and better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	Many comrades used their personal experiences to refute the fallacies advocated by the black clique of Zhou Yang, especially the "authority" in the theatrical world, Tian Han, who, in a symposium, talked about how "creation without tradition is like water without a source and wood without roots," which aroused the indignation of the attendees. Music creator Zhang Jing'an said: Tian Han's words are sheer nonsense. Only the people's struggle life is the sole source of creation. We once participated in the land reform struggle in the revolutionary old base area of Honghu. The revolutionary spirit of the Honghu people educated us greatly, making us feel as if we had returned to the revolutionary era, becoming members of the Honghu Red Guards, loving the revolution and Honghu like them, hating the enemy with the same hatred, and having the same firm belief in the Party and the communist cause. This set the tone for the music of this opera. Especially the sublime revolutionary qualities of many revolutionary martyrs provided the basis for shaping the musical images of the characters in the play.

	Actor Wang Yuzhen said: As a revolutionary literary worker, one must go deep into life and participate in the struggle. I created the image of the heroine Han Ying, which also proves this point. Originally, there was a very important line in the play, which was Han Ying's teaching to Liu Chang: "As long as we are like the sunflower facing the sun, always united with the Party, we will have the power to move mountains and rivers." At first, I only thought about how to use typical actions to highlight the meaning of this line, but my heart was empty. Later, I went deep into Honghu to live and perform, listening to old revolutionaries telling many stories about how Comrade He Long led the masses to fight bravely against the enemy, receiving profound class education. I then had new feelings. Later, when I said that line, I had genuine feelings for the Party and the revolution.

	Directly participating in the three great revolutions is the true way to go deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers

	Chairman Mao said in the "Talks": "Proletarian literature and art are part of the proletarian revolutionary cause as a whole." He also said: "We intellectuals who are literary workers must change our thoughts and feelings, undergo a transformation. Without this change and transformation, nothing can be done well, everything will be out of place." The troupe members felt particularly close to this teaching when they reviewed it. Actor Zhang Jichao said: We literary workers are first and foremost revolutionary soldiers and must have a high sense of responsibility for the proletarian revolutionary cause. Only in this way can we wholeheartedly participate in the people's revolutionary struggle, sharing weal and woe with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and truly changing our class feelings. Playwright Mei Shaoshan used their experience of creating two scripts to specifically illustrate the importance of literary workers directly participating in the people's revolutionary struggle practice. He said that before creating "Red Guards on the Honghu Lake," we went deep into the center of the revolutionary old base area of Xiang-E-Hu, Honghu, six times. Once, we directly participated in the land reform movement there, living and sharing fate with the poor and lower-middle peasants for a long time. At that time, we did not think about creating any script at all, but only about making a revolution with the people of Honghu. In participating in the land reform struggle, the revolutionary spirit of the Honghu people deeply educated us, making us understand their revolutionary heroic spirit shown in the long-term arduous struggle. In the days of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we participated in the struggle of the Honghu people to build a new socialist Honghu, and their sky-high enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit moved us even more. Therefore, when we began to create "Red Guards on the Honghu Lake" at the end of 1958, the initial draft was completed in a very short time. In the process of creating "Sparks of War in E'cheng" in 1960, although we went to Hong'an County, due to the emergence of personal selfish thoughts, we were eager to create a script, looking for materials, and conducting interviews, but did not participate in the struggle against natural disasters with the people of Hong'an who were affected by natural disasters. Our thoughts and feelings were out of place with the people of Hong'an. Although we collected some materials, the creation still failed. Therefore, going deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers must be sincere and honest, absolutely no pretenses, and must directly participate in revolutionary struggle practice, not as a bystander.

	Study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, transform one's worldview for a lifetime

	Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." Participants in the symposium unanimously agreed that to be a revolutionary literary worker, one must work hard on transforming one's worldview. This requires studying and implementing Chairman Mao's works, arming one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought. Wang Yuzhen said that the Party and Chairman Mao teach us that literary workers must establish a worldview of not seeking fame or gain, not fearing hardship or death, wholeheartedly for the revolution, and wholeheartedly for the people, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers for a lifetime. While Zhou Yang and these black clique figures advocate "three fame-ism" (famous writer, famous director, famous actor) and implement "three high policies" (high salary, high manuscript fee, high bonus), attempting to pull us proletarian literary warriors onto the capitalist, revisionist evil path, paving the way for their capitalist restoration. We must thoroughly criticize "three fame-ism" and "three high policies," transform our worldview for a lifetime, vow to be proletarian literary warriors, and resolutely serve workers, peasants, and soldiers for a lifetime. Orchestra member Liu Yugang said: "In the past, I always thought that I grew up under the red flag, that everything I have is given by the Party, and that doing the revolution was not a problem. It seemed that transforming my worldview had nothing to do with me. However, when the troupe needed me to play the erhu, I immediately thought, I have studied the flute for eight years, why do they ask me to play the erhu? The erhu is 'rustic,' and I won't get any fame or gain from it. The Party timely pointed out my wrong thinking, and I studied Chairman Mao's relevant works with this question in mind, comparing myself with Zhang Zedong and Norman Bethune, making me realize that the problem of the flute and the erhu is essentially a problem of worldview, a problem of serving the people or serving oneself. Thus, I decided to pick up the erhu to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, putting the people's interests first.

	Participants in the symposium said that studying Chairman Mao's works in a room is not good, and closing the door to talk about transforming one's worldview is also not transforming it. Only by long-term involvement in the fiery struggle can one truly grasp Chairman Mao's thoughts and transform one's worldview.

	All participants in the symposium unanimously agreed that in the great tide of the proletarian cultural revolution sweeping the country, on the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the republication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has extremely important and far-reaching significance. They expressed their determination to respond to the call of the "Talks," to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to go among workers, peasants, and soldiers, to go into the fiery struggle, to actively participate in this proletarian cultural revolution, to thoroughly smash the bourgeois black den, to firmly establish the proletarian red flag, to vow with the people of the whole country to smash all the so-called "experts," "authorities," "old heads," and "ancestors" of the 1930s literature and art, to thoroughly destroy all ghosts and monsters, and to establish a brand new proletarian socialist culture.

### 毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》照亮了无产阶级文化大革命的道路

    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》照亮了无产阶级文化大革命的道路
    沈阳部队学习毛主席著作积极分子和湖北实验歌剧团文艺工作者无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜这个有划时代意义的文献，决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底粉碎反党反社会主义文艺黑线，建立无产阶级新文艺
    新华社沈阳六日电　毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》重新发表后，人民解放军沈阳部队学习毛主席著作积极分子和广大官兵一样，怀着兴奋的心情纷纷集会，畅谈重新发表《讲话》的重大意义，怒斥反党反社会主义文艺黑线“祖师爷”周扬的反党反社会主义罪行。他们在发言中指出，毛主席这篇光辉著作，照亮了我国无产阶级文化大革命的道路，吹响了向反党反社会主义黑线发起总攻的进军号。我们一定要把《讲话》当作强大的思想武器，彻底粉碎周扬一伙反党黑帮，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把文化大革命进行到底。
    用毛主席的《讲话》作武器，向资产阶级黑线老巢发起总攻
    某团政治处副主任廖初江说：毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，照亮了无产阶级文化大革命的道路。只要我们紧紧掌握住这个强大的思想武器，就一定会把文化领域里的反党反社会主义的黑线连根拔掉。这个《讲话》的重新发表，标志着文化大革命进入一个新的阶段。我们有这一条最完整、最彻底、最正确的马克思列宁主义文艺路线，就一定能够粉碎文艺战线上以周扬为代表的资产阶级反党反社会主义的复辟阴谋。
    某部组织科副科长、特级战斗英雄郅顺义说：毛主席这篇《讲话》的重新发表，是对那些负隅顽抗的资产阶级“权威”的迎头痛击，捣开了反党反社会主义黑帮的老巢。周扬这个反党老手，不管他有多大威风，一定把他拉下马来，踩在脚下。广大工农兵群众，有了《讲话》这样强大的精神武器，腰杆更硬，眼睛更明，天不怕，地不怕，无论怎样顽固的碉堡，也要把它炸得粉碎。
    某连副政治指导员王道明说：重新发表《讲话》，就是向我们发出了新的战斗命令，下达了新的战斗部署。我们用毛主席这篇《讲话》的光辉思想，一定能把周扬这伙黑帮照得原形毕露。三十年代他们怕鲁迅怕得要死，恨得要死；现在他们对掌握了毛泽东思想的工农兵群众，也怕得要死，恨得要死，想一脚把工农兵踢开，好让他们主宰文化历史舞台，实现资本主义复辟的阴谋。正如毛主席在《讲话》中所说：“你们那一套是不行的，无产阶级是不能迁就你们的，依了你们，实际上就是依了大地主大资产阶级，就有亡党亡国的危险。”我们对他们就是要关门打狗，打就打垮。我们工农兵掌握了《讲话》这个强大思想武器，就象孙悟空手里有了千钧棒，要把一切牛鬼蛇神打得落花流水、断命绝种。
    某部红九连副政治指导员乔云岐说：毛主席早在二十四年前发表的这篇划时代的重要讲话里，对以周扬为代表的三十年代资产阶级文艺路线作了系统的批判。周扬这个文艺界反革命黑帮“祖师爷”，和一切反动派一样，反动本性丝毫没有改变，他采取更加隐蔽狡猾的手法把持文艺界，猖狂攻击伟大的毛泽东思想。多年以来，他们配合国内外的阶级敌人，向我们展开了争夺战。现在是彻底清算周扬反革命分子的罪行、彻底挖掉这条黑根的时候了。我们要以《讲话》这个最锐利的思想武器，集中火力指向黑帮老巢，打一场彻底的歼灭战。
    彻底清除周扬的修正主义文艺黑线，建立无产阶级新文艺
    雷锋生前所在班的现任班长曲建文说：毛主席这篇《讲话》确实是个照妖镜，重温这篇《讲话》，我们就可以照出周扬是个什么样的大妖。他从三十年代到六十年代，一直顽固地坚持修正主义的文艺黑线，与毛主席的文艺路线相对抗。这次把他揪出来，又一次显示了毛泽东思想的巨大威力。我们工农兵有了毛泽东思想这个照妖镜，周扬和他那一伙谁也休想溜掉。
    王道明说：周扬鼓吹的“全民的文艺”，就是封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的反动文艺，他打着“全民的文艺”的黑旗，贩卖修正主义的黑货，就是为赫鲁晓夫修正主义“全民党”“全民国家”开辟道路。毛主席教导我们：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”周扬肆意诋毁文艺为无产阶级服务的根本方向，就是妄想用资产阶级思想来改造我们，统治我们，这是绝对办不到的。周扬一伙拚命歌颂帝王将相、才子佳人，我们硬是要歌颂伟大的党，伟大的领袖毛主席，伟大的社会主义事业。就是要让无产阶级的革命精神，占领一切思想阵地。我们连队月月有晚会，处处有歌声，假日有活动，每项活动都是为无产阶级政治服务的。我们为宣传毛泽东思想，自编自演自唱的所有节目，最鼓舞人，最教育人，最解决问题。周扬贩卖的那一套资产阶级货色，我们不但不需要而且坚决反对！
    某连女炊事班长王宜文说：周扬胡说什么“任何一个阶级的艺术绝不只是给本阶级看的，它是给所有的阶级看的，引起所有人的共鸣”。毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会里就是只有带着阶级性的人性，而没有什么超阶级的人性。我们主张无产阶级的人性，人民大众的人性，而地主阶级资产阶级则主张地主阶级资产阶级的人性，不过他们口头上不这样说，却说成为唯一的人性。”用毛主席这段话一照，一眼就可以看穿周扬是顽固地反对无产阶级对资产阶级的阶级斗争，企图取消革命文艺的无产阶级的阶级性，而代之以资产阶级的阶级性。他企图用在他指挥下炮制出来的《舞台姐妹》《逆风千里》《兵临城下》等等资产阶级的反动黑货来腐蚀我们，达到他们夺取人民政权的可恶目的。
    某连炊事班长张道路说：掌握毛主席这篇《讲话》，我们的眼睛就亮，我们的鼻子就灵，哪是香花，哪是毒草，全都分得清清楚楚，以周扬为首的文化界的反党反社会主义黑帮分子，一个也跑不掉。由这伙黑帮制作的一切毒草，一株也不能留。是香花我们就“站岗”，是毒草我们就铲除。
    坚决遵照毛主席教导，工农兵一定要掌握文化大权
    廖初江说：毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是我国人民，也是世界人民真正掌握文化大权的理论武器。文化本来就是劳动人民创造的，长期以来被封建地主阶级和资产阶级垄断去，反过来作为压迫奴化我们的工具。这次文化大革命，毛主席领导我们夺回文化大权，我们一定要掌握、也一定能掌握文化大权。毛主席说：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”我们不仅能把黑帮“祖师爷”从文化舞台上彻底打下去，而且能雄赳赳气昂昂地登上文化舞台。我入伍以前只上过三年学，今年“七一”，怀着对党对毛主席无限热爱的心情，第一次给报纸写诗，我心里有说不完的话。事实证明，广大工农兵同志是能成为文化的主人的。我们要紧握枪杆子，要紧握笔杆子，用这“两杆子”来保卫无产阶级专政，保卫伟大的毛泽东思想。
    王道明说：革命战士最爱伟大的党，伟大的领袖毛主席。我和连队美术组的同志们苦战了几个月布置“红军室”，画连队长征时走过的路线，画勇敢跟敌人拚刺刀的英雄，画一次受一次毛泽东思想的教育。冬天手冻了，就出去练一阵刺杀回来再画，一来劲，就干他一个通宵。而在学校时，在周扬的黑线指挥下，只叫我们临摹仕女图、百鸟图，妄图把我们培养成为资产阶级接班人。这是周扬一伙人的大阴谋。我们有了《讲话》这个指南针，有阶级斗争的实践，就一定能够画出世界上最新最美的图画。
    王宜文说：毛主席这篇讲话，大大鼓舞了我们掌握文化大权的信心。最近，看了沈阳音乐周工农兵大唱大演歌颂党歌颂毛主席的盛大演出，特别是著名的学习毛主席著作积极分子李素文，亲自登台领唱，热情歌颂毛主席，我在台下浑身是劲，觉得喊一百句毛主席万岁，也表达不出心里要说的话。我们班过去文娱活动开展得不够好，在文化大革命中，学了《讲话》，认识到这是一场夺权夺魂的你死我活的阶级大搏斗，唱一次革命歌，演一个革命节目，就是宣传一次毛泽东思想，就是射向反党反社会主义黑帮的一颗子弹，大家都行动起来，自编自演歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲。新战士赵先兰不顾炉火烤得口干舌燥，边烧火，边学唱歌颂文化大革命的新歌。大家一致表示，一定要把《讲话》当作最高指示，坚信不疑，坚决照办，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    据新华社武汉六日电　湖北省实验歌剧团的文艺工作者最近举行座谈，欢呼毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》重新发表。他们重温毛主席的指示，对这个划时代的重要文献表示无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜；对资产阶级、修正主义和所谓三十年代文艺的黑线无比愤慨，决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    十几年来，在这个歌剧团中，同样贯穿着无产阶级文艺红线和资产阶级文艺黑线的尖锐斗争，贯穿着和平演变与反和平演变的尖锐斗争。在这一斗争中，他们深刻体会到：什么时候他们比较注意活学活用毛主席著作，比较认真地贯彻执行毛泽东文艺思想，象《洪湖赤卫队》这样优秀的歌剧就产生出来，剧团就出现了崭新的局面，就得到工农兵群众的热烈拥护。什么时候他们受到以周扬为代表的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的文艺黑线的冲击和影响比较大，剧团就一无所成，就脱离了工农兵，就为工农兵群众所反对。他们从切身体会中深深地认识到，毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，就是文艺界的永远不落的红太阳，就是文艺界的锐利武器，就是文艺界的传家宝，就是文艺界的命根子，《讲话》的每一句每一条都是文艺界的工作纲领。大家表示，要读一辈子毛主席的书，干一辈子革命，改造一辈子思想，把毛主席著作，把毛主席的《讲话》当作文艺工作者的最高指示，做坚强的无产阶级的文艺战士。
    坚持为工农兵服务的过程，是阶级斗争的过程
    毛主席在《讲话》中说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”参加座谈会的同志根据自己十几年来实践的经验和教训，体会到为谁服务是个立场问题，是个革命不革命的问题。演员王玉珍、夏奎斌说：毛主席教育我们为工农兵服务，可是我们有时执行得不够坚决，解决得不够彻底。十几年来的事实告诉我们，什么时候听了毛主席的话，按毛主席的话去做，全心全意地真诚地为工农兵服务，我们就方向明、路子正，就能破除迷信，就象初生牛犊不怕虎，有的是干劲，有的是精神，就能创造出象《洪湖赤卫队》这样受工农兵欢迎的优秀剧目。相反地，我们有时候没有很好地听毛主席的话，没有按毛主席的话去做，就脱离工农兵，就一时迷失方向，受到工农兵的反对。
    参加座谈会的人们认为：坚持为工农兵服务的过程是个阶级斗争的过程，是无产阶级红线与资产阶级黑线斗争的过程。究竟为什么人服务？围绕这个问题所展开的斗争在他们剧团内几乎年年都在进行，有时进行得非常激烈。编剧梅少山说，周扬黑帮们曾经不遗余力地提倡剧团实现什么“专业化，正规化，剧院化”，用心是十分恶毒的。他就是要我们不要做革命的文艺工作者，不要为工农兵服务。他们这条反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的文艺黑线，虽然没有把我们压服，但冲击还是有的，甚至给工作带来了一些困难。尽管这样，由于我们听了党和毛主席的话，大抓阶级斗争，还是抵制了周扬这伙黑帮吹起的这股黑风，坚持了为工农兵服务这个根本方向。
    剧团的支部书记刘恩显和副书记郭智冰系统地回忆了剧团在为谁服务问题上这几年来阶级斗争的历史。他们说，一九五七年反右派斗争以后，我们一直坚持演革命现代戏。但是一九六一年和一九六二年这个期间，由于受到文艺界黑帮黑线的冲击和影响，剧团里出现了古里古怪的轻音乐，有些人追求个人名利，不愿深入工农兵，也有人看到别处上演《桃花扇》、《窦娥冤》，便也跃跃欲试。这说明阶级斗争是时隐时现的，是不断反复的；斗争每胜利一次，就使我们和毛泽东思想接近一步。我们今天重新学习《讲话》，就要更加坚定活学活用毛泽东著作，把毛主席的书当作最高指示，这是根本的根本。只有这样，我们的文艺工作才能方向明、道路正，才能有所创造，有所前进。
    丰富的人民生活，是文学艺术的唯一源泉
    毛主席说：“人民生活中本来存在着文学艺术原料的矿藏，这是自然形态的东西，是粗糙的东西，但也是最生动、最丰富、最基本的东西；在这点上说，它们使一切文学艺术相形见绌，它们是一切文学艺术的取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一的源泉。”剧团的同志们从实践中体会到：只有遵循毛主席的这一教导，深入生活，参加到群众的革命斗争中去，才能创作出为工农兵所喜爱的戏，才能更好地为工农兵服务。
    许多同志都用自己的切身感受批驳了周扬黑帮所宣扬的什么“全盘继承”等谬论。特别是这伙黑帮在戏剧界的“权威”田汉，在一次座谈会上，大谈什么“创作离开了传统，就等于无源之水，无根之木”，更引起到会同志的愤慨。音乐创作人员张敬安说：田汉的这些话，完全是胡说八道。只有人民的斗争生活才是创作的唯一源泉。我们曾经在革命老根据地洪湖参加土改斗争。洪湖人民的革命精神对我们教育很大，使我们也好象回到了大革命时代，成为洪湖赤卫队员之一，同他们一样热爱革命，热爱洪湖，同他们一样对敌人怀着无比的仇恨，也和他们一样，对党对共产主义事业怀着坚贞的信念。这样就为这部歌剧的音乐定下了基调。特别是许多革命先烈的崇高的革命品质，更为塑造剧中人物的音乐形象提供了根据。
    演员王玉珍说：作为一个革命的文艺工作者，必须深入生活，参加斗争，我创造韩英这个英雄形象的过程，也证明了这一点。原来，剧中有一段很重要的台词，就是韩英教导刘闯说的：“只要我们象葵花向阳那样，时刻和党连在一起，我们就有力量排山倒海。”开始，我对这段台词只想到如何用典型的动作来突出这段话的意义，而内心却是空虚的。后来，我深入到洪湖去生活和演出，听老革命同志讲了许多当年贺龙同志怎样领导群众对敌人进行英勇斗争的故事，受到深刻的阶级教育，我才有了新的感受。以后再说那段台词，就有了对党对革命的真实感情。
    直接参加三大革命，才能真正深入工农兵
    毛主席在《讲话》中说：“无产阶级的文学艺术是无产阶级整个革命事业的一部分”。又说：“我们知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”剧团的同志们在重温这一教导时感到特别亲切。演员章继超说：我们文艺工作者，首先是个革命战士，必须对无产阶级革命事业具有高度的责任感，只有这样，才能全心全意地参加群众的革命斗争，同工农兵同甘共苦，阶级感情才能彻底变化。编剧梅少山用他们创作两个剧本的经过，具体说明文艺工作者直接参加群众革命斗争实践的重要性。他说，我们创作《洪湖赤卫队》之前，曾经先后六次深入到湘鄂西革命老根据地的中心——洪湖，其中一次是直接参加那里的土地改革运动，长期同贫下中农同呼吸共命运。那时，我们根本没有想到创作什么剧本，只是想着和洪湖人民一道闹革命，闹翻身。在参加土改斗争中，洪湖人民的革命精神深深教育了我们，对他们过去在长期艰苦的斗争中所表现的革命英雄气概有所认识。在一九五八年大跃进的日子里，我们又参加了洪湖人民建设社会主义新洪湖的斗争，他们所表现的冲天干劲和革命精神，更加激动我们。因此，我们在一九五八年底开始创作《洪湖赤卫队》时，剧本初稿只用很短时间就完成了。在一九六○年创作《鄂东烽火》的过程中，虽然到了红安县，但由于产生了个人私心杂念，急于创作剧本，一心找材料，搞访问，而没有和受到自然灾害袭击的红安人民一起同自然灾害进行斗争，思想感情上与红安人民格格不入。尽管搜集了一些材料，创作还是失败了。所以，深入工农兵，必须老老实实，绝对来不得半点虚假，必须直接参加到革命斗争实践中去，而不能作旁观者。
    学习一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子世界观
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变。”参加座谈的同志一致认为，要做一个革命的文艺工作者，必须在改造世界观上狠下工夫。这就要活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑。王玉珍说，党和毛主席教导我们，文艺工作者要树立不为名、不为利，不怕苦、不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民的无产阶级世界观，为工农兵服务一辈子，而周扬等这些黑帮人物却要鼓吹“三名主义”（名作家、名导演、名演员），推行“三高政策”（高薪金、高稿酬、高奖金），企图把我们无产阶级文艺战士拉到资本主义、修正主义的邪路上去，为他们实现资本主义复辟铺平道路。我们必须彻底批判“三名主义”和“三高政策”，改造一辈子世界观，誓当无产阶级的文艺战士，决心为工农兵服务一辈子。乐队队员刘御强说：“过去我总认为，自己是在红旗下长大的，我的一切都是党给的，干革命是不成问题的，改造世界观好象跟我也没关系。可是，当剧团需要我拉二胡的时候，当时我就想，我学了八年长笛，为什么叫我拉二胡呢？二胡是“土产”，我学了它得不到什么名利。党及时指出了我的错误思想，我带着这个问题学习了毛主席的有关著作，对照张思德、白求恩，使我认识到，原来长笛和二胡的问题，实质上就是个世界观的问题，是为人民服务还是为自己服务的问题。于是，我决心拿起二胡为工农兵服务，把人民的利益摆在第一位。
    参加座谈会的同志们说，坐在屋子里学习毛主席著作是学习不好的，关起门空谈改造世界观也是改造不了的。只有长期投身到火热的斗争中去，才能把毛主席思想学到手，才能改造世界观。
    参加座谈会的全体同志一致认为，在全国波澜壮阔、汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，在中国共产党成立四十五周年纪念日之际，重新发表毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，具有极其重大的现实意义和深远意义。他们表示，坚决响应《讲话》的号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，到工农兵中去，到火热的斗争中去，积极参加这场无产阶级文化大革命，大破资产阶级黑店，大立无产阶级红旗，誓同全国人民一道，把那些所谓三十年代文艺的“专家”、“权威”、“老头子”、“祖师爷”，统统打个落花流水，把一切牛鬼蛇神彻底摧毁，建立起崭新的无产阶级的社会主义的文化。
