Heroes Learn from Heroes

Combat hero Ma Xiande, who is currently recuperating in a hospital, after studying the brilliant deeds of the great communist warrior Liu Yingjun, excitedly declared: "I will be like Liu Yingjun, and more consciously, more actively, and more resolutely study and apply Chairman Mao's works. I will treat Chairman Mao's books as the highest directives for all my actions, and deeply engrave in my heart the communist worldview of 'revolution means struggle, struggle means happiness,' and 'live for the revolution, die for the revolution.'"

On the 14th, when the hospital nurse for the first time read to him from the newspaper about Liu Yingjun's deeds, Ma Xiande was so moved that he almost shed tears. He said, "Liu Yingjun will not die. He died for the people's interests, heavier than Mount Tai. He will forever live in our hearts."

In recent days, Ma Xiande has been eagerly reading the newspaper reports about Liu Yingjun's heroic deeds, or asking nurses to read them to him. To ensure he gets enough rest, nurses sometimes suggest he study less, but he always shakes his head and says, "No, it's okay!" When discussing how Liu Yingjun studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, treating Mao's books as the highest directives, and being a model executor of these directives, Ma Xiande, looking at the portrait of Liu Yingjun with deep emotion, said, "Learn from Liu Yingjun! He is Chairman Mao's good soldier, a model who reads Chairman Mao's books, listens to Chairman Mao's words, and acts according to Chairman Mao's directives. He is a model of selflessness, serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly."

Ma Xiande highly praises Liu Yingjun's firm stance, clear distinctions, and clear class and class struggle consciousness. He admires Liu Yingjun's revolutionary spirit of resolutely and bravely fighting against words and deeds that go against Mao Zedong Thought. He told the nurses, "We must be like Liu Yingjun, stand firmly on the proletarian stance, resolutely defend Mao Zedong Thought, and smash all counter-revolutionary gangs and all ghosts and monsters!" When he heard from the radio that American imperialists were bombing Hanoi and Haiphong in Vietnam, he angrily said, "We will learn from Liu Yingjun's spirit of 'live for the revolution, die for the revolution,' and be ready at any time to aid Vietnam and resist America. To annihilate American imperialism, we are not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice, and will bravely devote ourselves to the revolution."

After learning from Liu Yingjun, Ma Xiande has been studying Chairman Mao's works even more diligently. He repeatedly studies the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's sayings about class and class struggle, particularly focusing on the "use" aspect. Now, every morning after getting up, he always volunteers to sweep the floor, empty the spittoons, sometimes even fetches water for injured comrades, and assists those who have difficulty moving to go to the toilet or take a walk. When comrades praise him, he waves his hand and says, "No, we all need to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be like Liu Yingjun, becoming great communist warriors!"

To express his resolve to learn from Liu Yingjun and forever be Chairman Mao's good soldier, Ma Xiande wrote the following oath on July 19:

	To be like Liu Yingjun,
	Strive to study the highest directives,
	Faithfully execute the highest directives,
	Actively propagate the highest directives,
	Resolutely defend the highest directives,
	This is my lifelong mission!

    英雄学英雄
    麦贤得写下誓言：要象刘英俊那样，努力学习最高指示，忠实执行最高指示，积极宣传最高指示，坚决捍卫最高指示
    新华社广州二十一日电  正在医院养伤的战斗英雄麦贤得，在学习了伟大共产主义战士刘英俊同志的光辉事迹后，激动地表示：要象刘英俊那样，更自觉、更积极、更坚决地活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的书当作一切行动的最高指示，使“革命就要斗争，斗争就是幸福”、“生为革命生，死为革命死”的共产主义世界观深深地刻在心坎上。
    十四日，当医院护士长第一次给他读报纸上发表的刘英俊同志的事迹时，麦贤得激动得几乎流下眼泪，他说：“刘英俊同志不会死。他为人民利益而死，比泰山还重。他永远活在我们心里。”
    近几天，报纸上登载的刘英俊同志的英雄事迹，麦贤得总是爱不释手地拿着阅读，或请护士读给他听。为了照顾他休息，护士有时劝他少学习一会儿，他总摇摇头说：“不要，没关系！”谈到刘英俊同志活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的书当作一切行动的最高指示，是最高指示的模范执行者时，麦贤得无限深情地望着刘英俊烈士遗象，激动地说：“学习刘英俊同志！他是毛主席的好战士，是读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按照毛主席指示办事的模范，是毫不利己专门利人，完全、彻底为人民服务的榜样。”
    麦贤得非常称赞刘英俊同志立场坚定、爱憎分明、有明确的阶级和阶级斗争观念。钦佩他对违背毛泽东思想的言论和行动进行坚决、勇敢斗争的革命精神。他对护士说：“我们要象刘英俊那样，站稳无产阶级立场，坚决捍卫毛泽东思想，把一切反革命黑帮、一切牛鬼蛇神统统打垮！”当他从广播中听到美帝国主义轰炸越南河内市和海防市时，他愤怒地说：“我们学习刘英俊‘生为革命生，死为革命死’的精神，随时准备援越抗美。为了消灭美帝国主义，不怕流血牺牲，勇敢献身革命。”
    学习刘英俊以后，麦贤得学习毛主席著作抓得更紧了，他不断地反复地学习“老三篇”，学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的语录，特别在“用”字上狠下功夫。现在，每天早上起床后，他总是争着拖地板，倒痰盂，有时还给伤病员打洗脸水，搀扶着行动不方便的伤病员去大小便或散步。同志们表扬他时，他却摆摆手说：“不要，我们都要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，象刘英俊那样，做伟大的共产主义战士！”
    为了表达向刘英俊同志学习的决心，永远做毛主席的好战士，麦贤得在七月十九日写下了以下誓言：
    要象刘英俊那样，
    努力学习最高指示，
    忠实执行最高指示，
    积极宣传最高指示，
    坚决捍卫最高指示，
    这是我毕生的战斗任务！
