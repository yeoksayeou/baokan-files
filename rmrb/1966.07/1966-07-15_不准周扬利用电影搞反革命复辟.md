Title: Do Not Allow Zhou Yang to Use Film to Stage a Counter-Revolutionary Restoration

For sixteen years, under the control and influence of the literary and artistic black line led by Zhou Yang, and under the direct command of the black gang members of the Ministry of Culture such as Xia Yan, the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture did not implement the policy of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Instead, it carried out a bourgeois, revisionist literary and artistic black line. They used film as a tool to attack the proletariat and as a means to restore capitalism.

Now, we will expose the three major crimes of the anti-party, anti-socialist black gang led by Zhou Yang from the perspective of film distribution and screening:

1. Under the control of Zhou Yang's so-called "serving the entire people" reactionary program, a large number of so-called "light-hearted and enjoyable" films and so-called "traditional art" opera films were produced and distributed, spreading feudalism, capitalism, and revisionist poisonous ideas among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Zhou Yang has always advocated for so-called "light-hearted and enjoyable" films. In May 1963, in his speech at the National Story Film Factory Directors and Party Committee Secretaries Meeting, he blabbered about how "harmless and beneficial are difficult to distinguish," and "films should be beneficial, but not necessarily all politically strong works." Under the influence of Zhou Yang's reactionary advocacy, many so-called "light-hearted and enjoyable" films emerged. These films do not discuss class and class struggle, nor do they discuss the socialist revolution. Instead, they extensively promote the ideas of "love above all," "personal struggle," "eating, drinking, and playing," and the bourgeois lifestyle.

Zhou Yang and others vigorously promoted so-called "traditional art" opera films. In August 1960, in his speech at the Dramatists' Association Working Meeting, he shouted: "Making the repertoire of plays monotonous is not only against the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, but also against communism." The evil wind of promoting so-called "traditional plays" also blew into the film industry. In 1962 alone, various factories produced thirteen opera films, accounting for 38% of the total number of feature films produced that year. Over the past decade, a large number of opera films have been distributed and screened. These films all promote emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, ghosts, and demons, spreading feudal morality and superstition.

Chairman Mao taught us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." Zhou Yang's vigorous promotion of so-called "harmless and beneficial," "light-hearted and enjoyable" films is to poison the people with the thoughts of the exploiting class and prepare conditions for the restoration of capitalism.

2. Under the influence of Zhou Yang's advocacy of so-called "exposing the dark side" and the "spirit of Hai Rui's Memorial," many reactionary films attacking the socialist system and the Party Central Committee were produced and screened.

Zhou Yang vigorously advocated for so-called satirical comedies to distort and attack the socialist system. In 1955, Zhou Yang actively promoted so-called "comedies" at the Film Script Workshop. Under his promotion, in 1956 and 1957, a batch of poisonous weeds that distorted workers, peasants, and soldiers, defamed old cadres, and attacked the socialist system were produced. In February 1961, Zhou Yang said at the Shanghai Film Bureau's Spring Festival Tea Party: "Life is already very tense now, don't make people so tense when watching a play. After people are tense, let them relax and enjoy themselves a bit, which is also a form of coordination, so we should produce some light-hearted and enjoyable things... We can produce a lot of comedies and slapstick films." Under his direct promotion, films such as "Fan of Football" and "Big Li, Small Li, and Old Li" were produced or screened, maliciously defaming workers, peasants, and soldiers, and attacking the new society.

During the three years of difficulty, Zhou Yang, in collaboration with the domestic and foreign class enemies' attacks, went all out, openly advocating the "spirit of Hai Rui's Memorial," praising the "backbone" of counter-revolutionaries, and shouting to direct the spearhead of struggle against the Party Central Committee. On June 22, 1961, he said at the Film Creation Conference: "We must cultivate the spirit of 'Hai Rui's Memorial.'" Under his incitement and instruction, films such as "Sun An's Memorial" and "The Peony Pavilion" were produced, which are big poisonous weeds against the Party and socialism. To deceive people, in 1957, Zhou Yang also pretended to say at the Literary Workshop: "Scholars rebelling, three years are not enough... Intellectuals are only strong with their mouths and pens, and are not strong in other ways, so we should be at ease and not fear a great disorder in the world." In 1957, the second year after the Hungarian Petofi Club counter-revolutionary rebellion, Zhou Yang shouted about "not fearing a great disorder in the world." He was openly inciting scholars to rebel and stage a counter-revolutionary riot, wasn't he?

3. Under the control of Zhou Yang's literary and artistic black line, a large number of films from the 1930s and films adapted from 18th and 19th-century European bourgeois literary works were screened, spreading poison nationwide.

Under Zhou Yang's leadership, the film production plan of the former Ministry of Culture Party Group in 1955 wrote: "Appropriately emphasize the adaptation work of classical and outstanding literary, dramatic works and folk legends since the May Fourth Movement, etc." Thus, a batch of "1930s" films emerged.

Zhou Yang also vigorously advocated learning from the bourgeois literary works of the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe. He said: "The works of the 18th and 19th centuries in foreign countries should be taken first, and this method should be firmly adopted." In the film industry, so-called art masterpieces such as "The Idiot" and "White Nights" were screened. These films spread bourgeois decadent and reactionary ideas among the broad audience.

Our struggle against the Zhou Yang black gang is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between Marxism and revisionism. In this struggle, we must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overthrow this counter-revolutionary black gang, defeat it, and thoroughly eliminate its poison in the film industry!

### 不准周扬利用电影搞反革命复辟

　　不准周扬利用电影搞反革命复辟
　　文化部电影局杨桦等四人
    十六年来，在以周扬为首的文艺黑线的控制和影响下，在文化部黑帮分子夏衍等人的直接指挥下，文化部电影局不执行为工农兵服务的方针，而是执行了一条资产阶级、修正主义的文艺黑线。他们把电影作为向无产阶级进攻的工具，作为复辟资本主义的手段。
    现在，我们从电影的发行和放映方面来揭发周扬这伙反党反社会主义黑帮的三大罪状：
    一、在周扬所谓的“为全体人民服务”反动纲领控制下，大量摄制和发行所谓“轻松愉快”的影片，以及所谓“传统艺术”的戏曲片，在广大工农兵群众中散布封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的思想毒素。
    周扬一贯主张搞所谓“轻松愉快”的影片。一九六三年五月，他在全国故事片厂厂长、党委书记会议上的讲话中，胡说什么“无害与有益是很难分的”，“电影要搞有益的，但不一定都是政治性很强的作品。”在周扬这个反动主张的影响下，许多所谓“轻松愉快”的影片纷纷出笼。这些影片都不讲阶级和阶级斗争，不讲社会主义革命，而是大肆宣扬“爱情至上”、“个人奋斗”、“吃喝玩乐”等资产阶级思想和资产阶级生活方式。
    周扬等人竭力提倡所谓“传统艺术”戏曲片。一九六○年八月，他在剧协工作会议上的讲话中，叫嚷：“把戏剧剧目弄得单调，不仅是违背百花齐放的政策，而且对共产主义不利。”周扬大搞所谓“传统剧目”的妖风也刮到了电影方面。仅一九六二年，各厂就摄制了戏曲片十三部，占全年故事片产量总数的百分之三十八。十几年来，市场上发行放映了大量戏曲片。这些影片，都是宣扬帝王将相、才子佳人、鬼怪妖魔，散布封建道德、迷信思想的。
    毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”周扬竭力提倡搞所谓“无害有益”、“轻松愉快”的影片，就是要用剥削阶级思想来毒害人民，为资本主义复辟准备条件。
    二、在周扬提倡所谓“暴露黑暗面”、提倡“海瑞上本”精神的影响下，摄制和上映了许多攻击社会主义制度、攻击党中央领导的反动影片。
    周扬竭力提倡所谓讽刺喜剧，以歪曲和攻击社会主义制度。一九五五年，周扬在电影剧作讲习会上积极提倡所谓“喜剧”。在他的提倡下，一九五六年和一九五七年，摄制了一批歪曲工农兵、丑化老干部、攻击社会主义制度的毒草。一九六一年二月，周扬在上海市电影局的春节茶话会上说：“现在生活已经很紧张了，不要在看戏的时候，也都搞得那么紧张，在人们紧张之余，叫人们轻松愉快一下，也是一种配合，所以要搞些轻松愉快的东西出来，……可以大搞喜剧片，大搞滑稽片。”就在他的直接提倡下，摄制或上映了《球迷》、《大李、小李和老李》等一批坏电影，恶毒地丑化工农兵，攻击新社会。
    在三年困难时期，周扬配合国内外阶级敌人的进攻，赤膊上阵，公开提倡“海瑞上疏”的精神，赞扬反革命分子的“骨气”，叫嚣把斗争的锋芒直接指向党中央。一九六一年六月二十二日，他在电影创作会议上说：“我们要培养这种‘海瑞上本’的精神。”在他的这种鼓动和指使下，摄制了《孙安动本》《桃花扇》等反党反社会主义的大毒草。为了迷惑人们的耳目，一九五七年周扬在文学讲习所还假意地说：“秀才造反，三年不成。……知识分子只有嘴巴厉害、笔厉害，其他是并不厉害的，所以我们要放心，不要怕天下大乱。”一九五七年是匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部反革命叛乱发生后的第二年，周扬竟然说什么“不要怕天下大乱”，他这样大喊大叫，不是明目张胆地煽动秀才起来造反，搞反革命暴乱吗？
    三、在周扬文艺黑线的支配下，大量放映了三十年代的影片以及根据十八、十九世纪欧洲资产阶级文艺作品改编的影片，流毒全国。
    在周扬主持下，一九五五年的前文化部党组的制片题材计划写道：“适当重视古典和五四以来的优秀文学、戏剧作品和民间传说等等的改编工作。”于是，一批“三十年代”的影片就纷纷出笼。
    周扬还竭力提倡学习欧洲十八、十九世纪的资产阶级文艺作品。他说：“十八、十九世纪的外国作品，都要首先拿来看看，坚决采取这个方式。”在电影方面，上映了所谓文艺巨片如《白痴》、《白夜》等等。这些影片在广大观众中散布了资产阶级的腐朽的反动思想。
    我们和周扬黑帮的斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级、马克思主义和修正主义之间的你死我活的斗争。在这一场斗争中，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把这个反革命的黑帮斗倒，打垮，彻底肃清它在电影界的流毒！
