The Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference has successfully concluded today.

Your conference, which has hoisted the banner of struggle against U.S.-led imperialism and old and new colonialism, has powerfully supported the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the Asian, African, and world peoples, and has powerfully supported the heroic Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. Your conference has carried forward the spirit of democratic consultation, fully discussed the development of new national cultures and literatures in Asia and Africa, and achieved great successes. This is a revolutionary conference. This is a conference of unity. This is a conference of victory.

Now, I and Comrades Kang Sheng, Chen Boda, and Tao Zhu, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, extend our warm congratulations to you. At the same time, on behalf of the entire Chinese people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the leadership of the Communist Party of China, who are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we extend revolutionary and militant greetings to you, the Asian-African writers!

During your conference, U.S. imperialism escalated its war of aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious stage. The U.S. is now loudly proclaiming that it will fight to the end in South Vietnam, obviously aiming to force the Vietnamese people to surrender, or else it will destroy Vietnam. However, the heroic Vietnamese people will never yield to U.S. war blackmail, and all truly supportive countries and peoples in the struggle against U.S. aggression in Vietnam will never waver in the face of U.S. war blackmail. The U.S. will never achieve its goals.

At this crucial moment when U.S. imperialism is expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, all truly supportive countries and peoples in the struggle against U.S. aggression in Vietnam can only respond to U.S. imperialism's challenge with one answer: to support the Vietnamese people in driving the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam with all their might, in all political, military, economic, and moral aspects, without any reservations. The Chinese people and the Chinese government have been doing this since the first day of U.S. aggression against Vietnam. We are determined to take any risks and pay any price to support our Vietnamese brothers until final victory is achieved.

This is a life-and-death struggle. Either we defeat U.S. imperialism, or we submit to U.S. imperialism. There is no middle ground. All revolutionary peoples of the world must abandon any illusions, believe in the power of the people, rely on the power of the people, unite as one, persist in the struggle, and thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors.

It is precisely at this crucial moment that the Indian government proposed to reconvene the Geneva Conference. This proposal is clearly intended to confuse the world's people and weaken the fighting spirit of the Vietnamese people. It is obvious that this is serving the interests of the U.S.

China was a participant in the 1954 Geneva Conference. It must be pointed out that the Geneva Agreement has long been completely torn up by the U.S. To talk about the Geneva Agreement, the U.S. must unconditionally, immediately, completely, thoroughly, and cleanly withdraw all its armed forces from Vietnam. The U.S. troops do not withdraw, and there is no question of reconvening the Geneva Conference.

It is precisely at this crucial moment that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique shamelessly declared: U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong does not affect U.S.-Soviet cooperation and the conclusion of disarmament agreements, while the U.S. in Vietnam is expanding its military operations. This is the most open and blatant betrayal of the Vietnamese people.

Everyone can see that in the expansion of U.S. imperialism's war of aggression against Vietnam, the Indian reactionaries and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique are playing such a shameful role. To the greatest extent possible, to isolate and strike at U.S. imperialism, the Asian, African, and world peoples need to continuously expand and strengthen the united front against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys from all sides. This united front should be based on the great unity of all revolutionary peoples of the world, including all countries and peoples suffering from U.S. imperialism's aggression, interference, control, and bullying, but it must not include the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and the Indian reactionaries. On the contrary, they can only be the objects of struggle in the international anti-U.S. united front.

Comrades and friends! The peoples of Asian and African countries know from their own experiences that to achieve true freedom and liberation, they must, while striving for complete political independence and economic self-reliance, launch a great cultural and ideological revolution. To smash the decayed, reactionary old cultures and ideas of imperialism and colonialism, and to establish and develop anti-imperialist revolutionary, popular, and national new cultures and ideas, is a common task facing the peoples of our Asian and African countries. In this regard, your conference has made outstanding contributions. We believe that your work will greatly aid the great struggle of Asian and African peoples for unity against imperialism.

Friends and comrades! At this conference, you warmly celebrated the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. Many representatives enthusiastically praised our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong and the great Mao Zedong Thought, and highly evaluated our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a manifestation of your great trust and support for the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. This is an encouragement and exhortation for the Chinese people to better learn and apply Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. For this, we express our heartfelt thanks to all our friends. You can be sure that the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people will forever be loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought and will never let down the expectations of the world's people.

Now, we propose:

To the brilliant victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation,

To the great unity of Asian-African writers and Asian-African peoples in the anti-imperialist revolution,

To the great victory of the struggle of the Asian, African, and world peoples against U.S.-led imperialism and old and new colonialism,

To the health of the friends and comrades present,

Cheers!

    中国人民永远忠于伟大的毛泽东思想  中国人民永远不辜负世界人民的期望
    周恩来总理在庆祝亚非作家紧急会议闭幕宴会上的讲话亲爱的来宾们，亲爱的朋友们，同志们：
    亚非作家紧急会议，今天胜利闭幕了。
    你们这次会议高举反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的战斗旗帜，有力地支持了亚非人民和世界人民的反帝革命斗争，有力地支持了英雄的越南人民的抗美救国斗争。你们的会议发扬了民主协商精神，就发展亚非民族新文化、新文艺的问题进行了充分的讨论，取得了巨大的成就。这是一次革命的大会。这是一次团结的大会。这是一次胜利的大会。
    现在，我和康生、陈伯达、陶铸三同志一起代表中国人民和中国政府，向你们表示热烈的祝贺；同时，还代表全中国在毛泽东思想指引下，在中国共产党领导下，进行文化大革命的工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，向你们——亚非作家们，致以革命的战斗的敬礼！
    在你们的会议进行期间，美帝国主义把侵略越南的战争上升到一个新的更加严重的阶段。美国现在口口声声要在越南南方打到底，其目的显然是，要压迫越南人民求和，否则就要摧毁越南。但是，英雄的越南人民决不会在美国的战争讹诈面前屈服，一切真正支持越南人民进行抗美战争的国家和人民，也决不会在美国的战争讹诈面前动摇。美国的目的，永远不会得逞。
    在美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的关键时刻，一切真正支持越南人民进行抗美战争的国家和人民，对美帝国主义的挑战只能有一个回答，那就是，用一切力量，在政治、军事、经济、道义各个方面，无保留地支持越南人民把美国强盗从越南赶出去。中国人民和中国政府从美国侵略越南的第一天起，就是这样做的。我们决心不怕冒任何风险，不惜付出任何代价，支援兄弟的越南人民，直到取得最后胜利。
    这是一场你死我活的斗争。要末就是战胜美帝国主义，要末就是屈伏于美帝国主义。中间的道路是没有的。全世界一切革命的人民，必须丢掉任何幻想，相信人民的力量，依靠人民的力量，团结一致，坚持斗争，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    正是在这关键的时刻，印度政府提出了重新召开日内瓦会议的建议。这个建议，完全是为了模糊世界人民的视线，涣散越南人民的斗志。一看就知道，这是为美国效劳。
    中国是一九五四年日内瓦会议的参加国。必须指出，日内瓦协议早就被美国彻底撕光了。要谈日内瓦协议，美国就必须无条件地立即、全部、彻底、干净地从越南撤走它的武装力量。美国兵不撤走，就根本谈不上重新召开日内瓦会议。
    又正是在这关键的时刻，苏联修正主义领导集团竟然丧心病狂地宣称：美国轰炸河内、海防，并不影响美苏合作、达成裁军协议，而美国在越南正是扩军扩战。这是对越南人民最公开露骨的出卖。
    大家可以看到，在美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争中，印度反动派和苏联修正主义领导集团扮演的是怎样一种可耻的角色。为了最大限度地孤立和打击美帝国主义，亚非人民和全世界人民有必要从各方面不断扩大和加强反对美帝国主义及其走狗的统一战线。这个统一战线，应当以全世界革命人民的大团结为基础，包括一切受到美帝国主义侵略、干涉、控制和欺负的国家和人民，但是绝不能包括苏联修正主义领导集团和印度反动派。相反，他们只能是国际反美统一战线斗争的对象。
    同志们，朋友们！亚非各国人民从自己的切身经验中知道，要求得真正的自由和解放，就必须在争取政治上的完全独立和经济上的自力更生的同时，展开一场文化思想方面的大革命。粉碎帝国主义和殖民主义的腐朽的反动的旧文化、旧思想，建立和发展反帝革命的、人民大众的、民族的新文化、新思想，是我们亚非各国人民所面临的共同任务。在这方面，你们的会议作出了杰出的贡献。我们相信，你们的工作必将大大有助于亚非人民团结反帝的伟大斗争。
    朋友们，同志们！你们在这次会议上热烈祝贺了中国共产党成立四十五周年。许多代表热烈颂扬了我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席和伟大的毛泽东思想，高度评价了我国社会主义文化大革命。这是对中国共产党和毛泽东主席的无比信任和支持，这是对中国人民更好地学习和运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的鼓舞和勉励。对此，我们向各位朋友们表示衷心的感谢。你们可以相信，中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，将永远忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，永远不辜负世界人民对于我们的殷切期望。
    现在，我们提议：
    为越南人民抗美救国斗争的辉煌胜利，
    为亚非作家和亚非人民的反帝革命的大团结，
    为亚非人民、全世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义斗争的伟大胜利，
    为在座的朋友们、同志们的健康，
    干杯！
