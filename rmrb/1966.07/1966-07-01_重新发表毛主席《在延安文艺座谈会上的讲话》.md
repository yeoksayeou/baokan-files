    The magazine "Red Flag" reissues Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" to commemorate the Party's birthday and promote the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    The editorial department has written a preface titled "The Compass of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" and published an article criticizing Zhou Yang's revisionist literary line.

    New China News Agency, June 30th: The ninth issue of the "Red Flag" magazine will be published on July 1st.

    To commemorate the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China and to promote the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, this issue of "Red Flag" reissues Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." The editorial department of "Red Flag" has written a preface titled "The Compass of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

    This issue of "Red Flag" publishes two editorials on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. One is titled "Trust the Masses, Rely on the Masses," and the other is "Thoroughly Criticize the Revisionist Line of Some Major Responsibles of the Former Beijing Municipal Committee."

    This issue of "Red Flag" publishes an article by Yuan Ming and Yuan Ruoying titled "Zhou Yang's Subversive Arrow Against History - A Critique of a Note in Volume Six of the Complete Works of Lu Xun." This article exposes the conspiracy of Zhou Yang and others to distort history. Zhou Yang and others openly contradict Mao Zedong's summary of the literary movement of the 1930s, attacking the great banner of the left-wing literary movement, Lu Xun, and portraying a bourgeois, revisionist literary black line as the Marxist-Leninist literary line. They portray a bourgeois capitulationist slogan of "National Defense Literature" as a proletarian slogan. Their goal is to openly raise the banner of the literary black line of the 1930s, opposing the Party and Mao Zedong's literary line.

    The article points out that Zhou Yang is the leader of the anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought literary black line. He strongly opposes the class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and opposes literature serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. He advocates for so-called "people's literature," which is actually capitalist, feudal, and revisionist reactionary literature, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

    This issue of "Red Flag" also publishes Mu Xin's article "National Defense Literature is the Slogan of Wang Ming's Right-Opportunist Line." This article analyzes the erroneous nature of the "National Defense Literature" slogan proposed by Zhou Yang in the 1930s. The article points out that this slogan is the slogan of Wang Ming's right-opportunist line, which abandons the proletarian standpoint, eliminates proletarian leadership, and is a thoroughgoing class capitulationism, a blatant betrayal of proletarian interests. Chairman Mao has long criticized Zhou Yang and the literary line he represents from the 1930s. However, Zhou Yang and his gang, while outwardly complying, inwardly resist. They do not accept Mao Zedong's criticism and, while pretending to comply, engage in a series of conspiracies behind the Party Central Committee, playing counterpoint to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

    The article concludes that the truth is now clear: the "ancestor" of the literary black line of the 1930s is Zhou Yang. Tian Han and Xia Yan once respectively proclaimed themselves as the "old man" of the theater and film circles of the 1930s, and they were very enthusiastic in promoting the "literary movement of the 1930s," but the one who wielded the baton behind them was Zhou Yang. The representative of the revisionist black line, who carried it from the 1930s to the 1960s, was Zhou Yang. Since liberation, all the bad elements in China's literary and art circles have almost all come from Zhou Yang, this "ancestor" of revisionist literature and art. In the fierce class struggle on the literary and art front, Zhou Yang has become a "big red umbrella" that shelters all ghosts and monsters. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly eliminate the influence of Zhou Yang's revisionist black line in literary and art work, and unswervingly carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

### 重新发表毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》

    《红旗》杂志为纪念党的生日　推动无产阶级文化大革命
    重新发表毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》
    编辑部为此发表题为《无产阶级文化大革命的指南针》的按语并发表文章揭露批判周扬的修正主义的文艺路线
    新华社三十日讯　一九六六年第九期《红旗》杂志，将于七月一日出版。
    为着纪念中国共产党四十五周年的生日，为着推动我国无产阶级文化大革命的发展，这期《红旗》重新发表了毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，《红旗》杂志编辑部为此写了按语，题目是《无产阶级文化大革命的指南针》。
    这期《红旗》发表了关于无产阶级文化大革命的两篇社论。一篇题为《信任群众，依靠群众》，另一篇是《彻底批判前北京市委一些主要负责人的修正主义路线》。
    这期《红旗》发表了阮铭、阮若瑛写的一篇文章，题目是《周扬颠倒历史的一支暗箭——评〈鲁迅全集〉第六卷的一条注释》。这篇文章揭露了周扬等人颠倒历史的阴谋。周扬等人公然同毛泽东同志对三十年代文艺运动的历史总结唱反调，攻击左翼文艺运动的伟大旗手鲁迅，把一条资产阶级、修正主义的文艺黑线说成是马克思列宁主义的文艺路线，把一个资产阶级投降主义的“国防文学”口号说成是无产阶级的口号。他们的目的，是为了公开打出“三十年代”文艺黑线的旗号，反对党和毛泽东同志的文艺路线。
    文章指出，周扬是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的文艺黑线首领。他极力反对无产阶级对资产阶级的阶级斗争，反对为工农兵服务的文艺，大搞所谓“全民的文艺”，也就是资本主义、封建主义、修正主义的反动文艺，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。
    这期《红旗》还发表了穆欣写的《“国防文学”是王明右倾机会主义路线的口号》一文。这篇文章分析了周扬在三十年代提出的“国防文学”口号的错误本质。文章指出，这个口号，是王明右倾机会主义的口号，它放弃无产阶级立场，取消无产阶级领导，是彻底的阶级投降主义，是对无产阶级利益的公开背叛。毛主席早就批评了周扬和他所代表的三十年代文艺路线。可是周扬及其一伙，对于毛泽东同志的批评，阳奉阴违。他们心里不服，在表面上作了一些伪装，背着党中央，进行了一系列的阴谋活动，同党中央、毛主席唱对台戏。
    文章最后指出，现在，真相已经大白：三十年代文艺黑线的“祖师爷”，正是周扬。田汉和夏衍曾分别自封为三十年代戏剧界和电影界的“老头子”，他们在鼓吹“三十年代文艺”的问题上都是很卖力气的吹鼓手，但是站在他们背后挥舞指挥棒的却是周扬。代表修正主义的黑线，把它从三十年代贯到六十年代的，正是周扬。解放以来，我国文艺界的一切坏东西，几乎都来源于周扬这个修正主义文艺的“祖师爷”。在文艺战线上激烈的阶级斗争中，周扬成了包庇一切牛鬼蛇神的“大红伞”。我们必须高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，彻底清除周扬这条修正主义黑线在文艺工作中的影响，坚定不移地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
