Ivory Coast representative Ernest Kojo said at the plenary session of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers today that imperialism means suffering for the people of all countries and is a hell for them. There is no peace between imperialism and us, and there is no cooperation between the oppressors and us. It is absolutely impossible for the American imperialists to coexist peacefully with the people of the world.

Kojo said that this emergency conference of Asian and African writers, despite the schemes and tricks of imperialism and reactionaries and the sabotage and split activities of revisionists, was finally held with the participation of representatives from more than fifty countries. This is a great victory for all revolutionaries in the world and a defeat for imperialism and its lackeys. He expressed agreement with the Indonesian delegation's proposal to hold the Third Asian and African Writers Conference in Beijing.

Kojo condemned American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. He expressed that the people of Ivory Coast unreservedly and firmly support the Vietnamese people's just war of liberation, and denounce Johnson's "peace talks" fraud.

He said that the sacred task of Asian and African writers is to use their pens to show the people the way to struggle, to mobilize the workers and peasants, and to persistently oppose imperialism, colonialism, and their running dogs.

Kojo spoke about China's Cultural Revolution, saying that it proves that the People's Republic of China is the center of the world revolution, and Chairman Mao Zedong is the supreme commander of the world revolution. The revolutionary people of the world are right in saying that Uncle Mao is their faithful friend, and Uncle Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist revolutionary of our time.

    象牙海岸代表恩内斯特的发言
    新华社四日讯　象牙海岸代表科乔·恩内斯特今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，帝国主义意味着各国人民的苦难，是各国人民的地狱。帝国主义和我们之间没有和平，压迫者和我们之间没有合作。美帝国主义与世界人民之间是绝对不可能和平共处的。
    恩内斯特说，这次亚非作家紧急会议不顾帝国主义和反动派的阴谋诡计，不顾修正主义者的破坏和分裂活动，终于在有五十多个国家的代表参加下举行，这是全世界革命者的伟大胜利，是帝国主义及其仆从的失败。他表示同意印度尼西亚代表团关于第三届亚非作家会议在北京举行的建议。
    恩内斯特谴责美帝国主义对越南的侵略。他表示象牙海岸的人民毫无保留地、坚定地支持越南人民正义的解放战争，谴责约翰逊的“和谈”骗局。
    他说，亚非作家的神圣任务是用他们的笔杆给人民的斗争指明道路，用笔杆动员工农群众，坚持不懈地去反对帝国主义、殖民主义及其走狗。
    恩内斯特谈到中国的文化大革命，他说，这证明了中华人民共和国是世界革命的中心，毛泽东主席是世界革命的最高统帅。世界革命人民说得对，毛伯伯是他们的忠实的朋友，毛伯伯是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义的革命家。
