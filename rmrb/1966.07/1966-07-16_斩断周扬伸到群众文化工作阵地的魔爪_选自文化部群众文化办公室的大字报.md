Sever the Magic Claws of Zhou Yang Reaching into the Field of Mass Cultural Work

	—Excerpt from a Big-Character Poster from the Mass Culture Office of the Ministry of Culture

Zhou Yang, this black gang leader, has long extended his anti-party, anti-socialist black hands into the field of mass cultural work, engaging in extensive conspiratorial activities.

Zhou Yang vigorously opposes Mao Zedong Thought. The instructions he formulated regarding the work of cultural centers and stations are a thoroughly revisionist program.

In December 1953, the Ministry of Culture issued the "Instructions on Rectifying and Strengthening the Work of Cultural Centers and Stations." This "instruction" was personally revised and finalized by Zhou Yang and issued under the "Zhou" document number.

The fundamental task of cultural centers and stations is to propagate Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers; to propagate the party's line, policies, and principles; to organize and guide workers and peasants in studying Chairman Mao's works; to organize and guide workers and peasants in engaging in socialist amateur cultural activities, to consolidate and expand the socialist ideological and cultural front, and to continuously raise the ideological consciousness of the people towards socialism and communism. However, Zhou Yang, this conspirator of bourgeois revisionism, negated and eliminated this fundamental task in this "instruction," not mentioning it from beginning to end.

In 1953, our party's general line for the transitional period had already been promulgated, and a vigorous wave of mutual aid and cooperation movements had swept across the vast countryside. Under such a favorable situation, cultural centers and stations should have vigorously propagated Mao Zedong Thought, the party's general line for the transitional period, and the principles and policies of mutual aid and cooperation, as well as their superiority. However, in this "instruction," Zhou Yang emphasized: "All activities of cultural centers and stations must respect local customs and traditions, as well as the inherent traditions of ethnic minorities and the masses."

Everyone knows that there is much feudalism and capitalist dross in "ethnic and folk traditions." Chairman Mao has long taught us to take the essence and discard the dross from ethnic and folk traditions. However, Zhou Yang wants cultural centers and stations to respect and inherit this dross in "all activities," with the intention of opposing Mao Zedong Thought and trying every means to turn cultural centers and stations into tools for capitalist restoration.

Under the influence of Zhou Yang's bourgeois, revisionist black line, many cultural centers and stations do not propagate Mao Zedong Thought, do not propagate the party's general line, do not propagate the principles and policies of mutual aid and cooperation, and do not organize and guide the masses in studying Chairman Mao's works. Instead, they are keen on setting up amateur theater troupes, performing ancient plays, and not performing revolutionary modern plays; performing emperors, generals, and scholars, and not performing workers, peasants, and soldiers, spreading feudalist and capitalist poison, allowing those reactionary, obscene, and feudal superstitions to spread everywhere, poisoning the people. This root of evil is Zhou Yang.

Zhou Yang also vigorously obstructed and opposed the organization and guidance of rural clubs in studying Chairman Mao's works.

In March 1963, the Hebei Provincial Cultural Bureau held a symposium on rural club work. At this time, the nationwide mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the countryside had been launched and had achieved remarkable results. Under such a favorable situation, rural clubs should have placed the organization and guidance of the broad masses in studying Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. The cultural activities of rural clubs should perform revolutionary modern plays, sing the praises of heroes, and commend good deeds. However, Zhou Yang vigorously opposed and restricted rural clubs from doing so. He said at this symposium: "How to organize youth to study Chairman Mao's works also needs to be studied." "The number of people in study groups of Chairman Mao's works does not necessarily have to be large." In the face of the broad masses' urgent demand to study Chairman Mao's works, Zhou Yang still said that clubs organizing the study of Chairman Mao's works "need to be studied" and that the number of people participating in study groups of Chairman Mao's works "does not necessarily have to be large." Look, Zhou Yang is so cunning and treacherous in opposing and restricting the masses from studying Chairman Mao's works.

While opposing and restricting the masses from studying Chairman Mao's works, Zhou Yang also shot poisonous arrows of bourgeois "reading, writing, and arithmetic." He said: "Reading is acceptable and is fundamental. The cultural foundation is reading, writing, and arithmetic, which are fundamental abilities and the foundation of all culture. Everyone should be able to read, write, and calculate." Zhou Yang used such treacherous methods to deceive and poison the broad masses of rural youth.

On February 26, 1964, he said in a speech to the entire team of the Central Rural Cultural Work Team in Zunhua County: "So-called culture is mainly reading and writing, and the amount of knowledge mainly depends on the amount of reading. The intellectualization of workers and peasants is basically the intellectualization of book knowledge."

The next day, he said at a symposium with representatives of returned youth participating in agricultural production in Zhouqiao Village, Xindianzi Commune, Six District, Zunhua County: "So-called culture is mainly reading and writing, learning knowledge. A big intellectual is someone who reads a lot and knows a lot; a small intellectual is someone who reads a little and knows a little."

Zhou Yang thus attempted to use the means of learning culture and increasing knowledge to oppose and restrict rural youth from studying Chairman Mao's works.

Zhou Yang's magic claws have reached too far. We, who work in the field of mass culture, must sever his magic claws. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, on the front of mass cultural work, uproot Zhou Yang's black line.

　　斩断周扬伸到群众文化工作阵地的魔爪
　　——选自文化部群众文化办公室的大字报
    周扬这个黑帮头子的手特别长，老早就把他的反党反社会主义的黑手伸到了群众文化工作方面来，大肆进行阴谋活动。
    周扬极力反对毛泽东思想，他所制订的关于文化馆、站工作的指示，是一个彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领。
    一九五三年十二月，文化部发布了《关于整顿和加强文化馆、站工作的指示》。这个“指示”，是周扬亲笔修改、定稿，并以“周字”文号下达的。
    文化馆、站的根本任务，是向广大工农兵群众宣传马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，宣传党的路线、方针、政策；组织和辅导工农群众学习毛主席著作；组织和辅导工农群众进行社会主义的业余文艺活动，以巩固和扩大社会主义的思想文化阵地，不断提高人民群众的社会主义和共产主义的思想觉悟。而周扬这个资产阶级修正主义的阴谋家，在这个“指示”中，把文化馆、站这一根本任务给否定了，砍掉了，从头到尾，只字未提。
    一九五三年，我们党的过渡时期总路线已经颁布了，广大农村掀起了轰轰烈烈的互助合作运动高潮。在这种大好形势下，文化馆、站应该大力宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的过渡时期总路线，宣传互助合作的方针、政策及其优越性。但是周扬在这个“指示”中，却强调：“文化馆、站的一切活动，均必须尊重当地的风俗习惯和民族、民间的固有传统。”
    谁都知道，在“民族、民间的固有传统”中，有很多封建主义、资本主义糟粕。毛主席早就教导我们，对民族民间的传统要取其精华，去其糟粕。而周扬却要文化馆、站在“一切活动”中，尊重和继承这些糟粕，其目的是反对毛泽东思想，千方百计地使文化馆、站变成搞资本主义复辟的工具。
    在周扬的资产阶级、修正主义黑线影响下，许多地方的文化馆、站不去宣传毛泽东思想，不去宣传党的总路线，不去宣传互助合作的方针政策，不去组织和辅导群众学习毛主席著作，而热中于搞业余剧团，演古戏，不演革命现代戏；演帝王将相、才子佳人，不演工农兵，散布封建主义、资本主义的毒素，使那些反动的、淫秽的、封建迷信的牛鬼蛇神到处泛滥，毒害人民。这个祸根，就是周扬。
    周扬还极力阻止和反对农村俱乐部组织和辅导群众学习毛主席著作。
    一九六三年三月，河北省文化局召开了农村俱乐部工作座谈会。这个时候，全国农村群众性的活学活用毛主席著作运动已经开展起来，并取得了显著效果。在这种情况下，农村俱乐部应该把组织和辅导广大群众学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。农村俱乐部的文艺活动，应当演革命现代戏，歌颂英雄人物，表扬好人好事。而周扬却极力反对和限制农村俱乐部这样做。他在这次座谈会上说：“毛主席著作怎么组织青年学，也要研究一下。”“学习毛著小组，人不一定很多。”在广大群众迫切要求学习毛主席著作的大好形势下，周扬对俱乐部组织毛主席著作学习，竟还“要研究一下”，还说参加毛主席著作学习小组的人“不一定很多”。看，周扬就是这样狡猾地阴险地反对和限制群众学习毛主席著作。
    周扬一面反对和限制群众学习毛主席著作，一面射出资产阶级“读、写、算”的毒箭。他说：“读书是可以的，而且是基本的。文化基础是读、写、算，这是基本的能力，是一切文化的基础，所有的人都应该会读、会写、会算。”周扬就是用这种阴险的手法，来欺骗和毒害农村广大青年。
    一九六四年二月二十六日，他在遵化县对中央农村文化工作队全体队员讲话时说：“所谓文化，主要是读书识字，知识多少主要是读书多少。工农分子知识化，基本上是书本知识化。”
    第二天，他又在遵化县六区新店子公社周桥大队还乡参加农业生产的知识青年代表座谈会上说：“所谓文化，主要是读书识字，学知识。大知识分子就是读书多，知识多；小知识分子就是读书少，知识少。”
    周扬就是这样妄图用学文化、长知识的手段，反对和限制农村青年学习毛主席著作。
    周扬的魔爪伸得太长了，我们做群众文化工作的同志，一定要斩断他的魔爪。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在群众文化工作阵地上把周扬的黑线连根拔掉。
