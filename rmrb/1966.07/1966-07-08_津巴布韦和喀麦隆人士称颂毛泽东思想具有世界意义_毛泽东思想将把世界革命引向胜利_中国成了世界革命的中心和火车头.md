Zimbabwean and Cameroonian figures praise the global significance of Mao Zedong Thought
Mao Zedong Thought will lead the world revolution to victory; China has become the center and locomotive of the world revolution

According to Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, July 6th: A member of the Zimbabwe African National Union delegation attending the recent Asia-Africa Journalists Association Secretariat meeting in Beijing, Zimbabwe journalist Andrew Muchenje, said: Chairman Mao is a great leader, a contemporary Lenin. The People's Republic of China is the "center and locomotive of the world revolution."

He emphasized, "Chairman Mao is not only the leader of China and the Chinese revolution, but also the leader of all progressive forces and the world revolution."

He also said that patriots and democratic fighters in Zimbabwe and around the world have found that Mao Zedong Thought is suitable for the revolutionary conditions in their own countries and regions. They are applying Mao Zedong Thought and achieving ever greater victories.

He pointed out, "Chairman Mao teaches us that all reactionaries are paper tigers, they are strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and they can be defeated. He also teaches us that the logic of all imperialist forces towards the people's cause is to create chaos, fail, create more chaos, fail again, until they perish. Chairman Mao teaches us how to deal with reactionary violence. Chairman Mao's theory of people's war is very brilliant."

He said passionately, "What a great leader Chairman Mao is! To have a contemporary Lenin in our world is a great honor. This contemporary Lenin is in the People's Republic of China—the center and locomotive of the world revolution."

He said, the general line and the policy of self-reliance embody Mao Zedong Thought. He believes that the Chinese people, using Mao Zedong Thought, will promote China's great leap forward. He said, "Taking an uncompromising stance against modern revisionism, domestic reactionaries, and imperialism led by the United States, and waging an unrelenting struggle against them, makes me firmly believe that China is a genuine Marxist-Leninist socialist country."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, July 7th: Cameroonian Union member Ngum Andre said to a Xinhua News Agency reporter here, the Chinese revolution is the greatest revolution in the world, and the victory of the Chinese revolution is due to the achievement of Mao Zedong Thought, which will also lead the world revolution to victory.

He said, for many years, he has read Mao Zedong's works every day and found new revolutionary truths in them every day. He said, "I believe that all true revolutionaries must read Mao Zedong's works."

Ngum Andre pointed out, "Chairman Mao has creatively enriched Marxism-Leninism. His works have global significance. Mao Zedong Thought is a beacon, without which revolution cannot be carried out."

He talked about the sincere members of the Cameroonian Union who enthusiastically and seriously study Mao Zedong's works and engage in heated discussions.

He said, among his simple belongings, there is a copy of "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong." He said, "This is indispensable to me. I can lose other things, but I must keep this book at all costs."

    津巴布韦和喀麦隆人士称颂毛泽东思想具有世界意义
    毛泽东思想将把世界革命引向胜利  中国成了世界革命的中心和火车头
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆六日电　出席最近在北京举行的亚非新闻工作者协会书记处会议的津巴布韦非洲民族联盟代表团团员、津巴布韦新闻工作者安德鲁·穆琴杰说：毛泽东主席是伟大的领袖，是当代的列宁。中华人民共和国是“世界革命的中心和火车头”。
    他强调指出：“毛主席不仅是中国和中国革命的领袖，也是一切进步力量和世界革命的领袖。”
    他还说，津巴布韦以及全世界各地的爱国和民主战士，都发现毛泽东思想适合于他们本国和本地区存在的革命条件。他们正在运用毛泽东思想并且取得日益巨大的胜利。
    他指出：“毛主席教导说，一切反动派都是纸老虎，他们外强中干，他们是可以被战胜的。他还教导我们，一切帝国主义势力对待人民事业的逻辑是，捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡。毛主席教导我们怎样对付反动暴力，毛主席关于人民战争的学说是非常光辉的。”
    他怀着激情说：“毛主席是一位多么伟大的领袖！在我们的世界上有了一位当代的列宁，这是莫大的光荣。这位当代的列宁就在中华人民共和国——世界革命的中心和火车头。”
    他说，总路线和自力更生方针体现了毛泽东思想。他相信，中国人民运用毛泽东思想将促进中国的大跃进。他说：“对现代修正主义、国内反动派和以美国为首的帝国主义采取不妥协的态度，并且同它们进行毫不留情的斗争，这使我对中国是一个真正的马克思列宁主义的社会主义国家这点深信不疑。”
    据新华社阿尔及尔七日电　喀麦隆人民联盟盟员恩古姆·安德烈在这里对新华社记者说，中国革命是世界上最大的一次革命，中国革命的胜利是由于毛泽东思想取得的，毛泽东思想也将把世界革命引向胜利。
    他说，他好几年以来每天都读毛泽东著作，每天都从中发现了新的革命道理。他说：“我认为，所有真正的革命者都必须阅读毛泽东的著作。”
    恩古姆·安德烈指出：“毛泽东主席创造性地丰富了马克思列宁主义。他的著作具有世界意义。毛泽东思想是灯塔，没有它就不能进行革命。”
    他谈到喀麦隆人民联盟真诚的盟员们满怀热情地认真学习毛泽东著作，并进行热烈的讨论。
    他说，在他简单的行李中就有一本《毛泽东军事文选》。他说：“这对我来说是必不可少的，我的其他东西都可以丢，但我无论如何要保留这本书。”
