	Indonesian Right-Wing Thugs Continue to Rampage Against Chinese
	Brazenly Seize the Office of Xinhua News Agency's Jakarta Branch

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 2nd, news from Jakarta: Twenty-plus "KAMI" thugs fostered by the right-wing military regime in Indonesia, at 11:30 AM on the 2nd, once again savagely attacked the office of Xinhua News Agency's Jakarta branch and forcibly evicted the watchmen, seizing the office.

	After breaking into the Xinhua News Agency's Jakarta branch compound by climbing over the wall, the thugs forcibly hoisted the Indonesian national flag and used weapons to smash open the doors of the office and dormitory, ransacking the place and wantonly destroying property. The thugs also entered the rooms, threatening the watchmen Xie Yinsheng and Liu Yinfu and their family members with iron and wooden rods, demanding that they hand over all the keys to the rooms and threatening, "If you don't hand over all the keys, we'll kill you!" Xie Yinsheng immediately sternly told them, "We are sent by the Chinese Embassy to guard the house. If you have any business, go to the Embassy!" The thugs then savagely beat him, forcibly searched him, and cursed, "Who cares about your Embassy! Get out of here immediately!"

	After the incident, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia immediately called the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the police authorities to protest and demanded that they immediately expel the thugs who had seized the Xinhua News Agency's branch office.

    印尼右派暴徒继续疯狂反华
    竟悍然霸占新华社雅加达分社办公处
    据新华社二日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权豢养的“卡米”暴徒二十多人，二日上午十一时半，再次野蛮地袭击了新华社雅加达分社办公处，并且殴打和赶出分社看守雇员，强行霸占了分社办公处。
    这批暴徒在翻墙侵入新华社雅加达分社院内以后，强行挂起印度尼西亚国旗，并用凶器砸破了办公室和宿舍的房门，翻箱倒柜，恣意破坏。暴徒们还进入屋里，用铁棒、木棒等威胁看守雇员谢银生、刘银发和他们的家属，强迫他们交出所有房间的钥匙，并威胁说：“如不交出全部钥匙，就打死你们！”雇员谢银生当即严正地对他们说：“我们是中国大使馆派来看房子的，你们有事找大使馆去！”暴徒们就野蛮地打他，强行搜身，并且辱骂说：“管你们什么大使馆！你们立即滚出去！”
    事件发生以后，中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆当即打电话给印度尼西亚外交部和警察当局提出抗议，并且要求它们立即驱逐这批强占新华社分社办公处的暴徒。
