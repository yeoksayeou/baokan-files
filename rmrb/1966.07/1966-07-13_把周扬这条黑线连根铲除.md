The surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with its majestic and overwhelming momentum, is sweeping away all monsters and demons. Under the radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, a handful of anti-Party elements have been exposed, revealing their true colors and hideous faces. Now, Zhou Yang, the "patriarch" of revisionist literature and art, has been dragged out. Good! This is another great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

As early as 1942, in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Chairman Mao taught us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a definite class and are geared to a definite political line. Art for art's sake, art above classes, and art divorced from politics are frauds. They are products of the bourgeoisie."

The history of class struggle has repeatedly proven the brilliance of Chairman Mao's thesis. All anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought monsters and demons have always tried every means to erase the class nature of literature and art, spreading the poisonous fog of "art above classes" and peddling bourgeois and revisionist goods to pave the way for the restoration of capitalism. Zhou Yang, who claims to be a "Marxist," has openly shouted:

	"…The relationship between resonance and class nature is not great. The art of any class is not just for its own class to see; it is for all classes to see, resonating with all people. Therefore, artistic works can be accepted by any class, and works produced by a class cannot be enjoyed only by that class; otherwise, the work is a failure."

What kind of goods is Zhou Yang peddling? Which temple's "god" is he? Isn't it clear?

Chairman Mao says: "In class society, every individual lives in a definite class position, and every kind of thought inevitably bears the stamp of a class."

Every piece of literature and art is created by people of a definite class, and their works inevitably bear the "stamp" of their class. Since opposing classes have fundamentally different interests, their literature and art must be fundamentally opposed. How can one imagine that the bourgeoisie and the proletariat can have a common language? Can the new ballet "White-Haired Girl" arouse the sympathy of the landlord class? Can the film "Thousand Miles Against the Wind" inspire the fighting spirit of revolutionary soldiers? After the publication of "Diary of Lei Feng," "Diary of Wang Jie," and "Song of Ouyang Hai," the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers eagerly bought these books and regarded them as vivid teaching materials for our ideological revolution. We say these are good books that inspire our revolutionary spirit. But can these books arouse the "resonance" of Zhou Yang and his group of bourgeois spokesmen? Can they be "accepted" by them? The matter is clear: proletarian works will never arouse the resonance of the bourgeoisie, and vice versa, bourgeois works will never arouse the resonance of the proletariat! As long as classes and class struggle exist, art that can arouse the resonance of all classes will never appear! Is Zhou Yang talking in his sleep? No, Zhou Yang blatantly denies the class nature of literature and art with the purpose of poisoning the masses, organizing minions to attack the Party, socialism, Mao Zedong Thought, and revolutionary people, and preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism!

Under the mirror of Chairman Mao's "Talks," Zhou Yang's true colors have been exposed! The anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black line in the literary and artistic circles has been unearthed! This is a great thing! Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." We are revolutionary fighters trained by Chairman Mao. The gun is in our hands, and the pen is also in our hands. The most powerful weapon in the world—Mao Zedong Thought—has armed us. We must uproot the black line of literature and art that is anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, and let the red flag of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought fly forever!

　　把周扬这条黑线连根铲除
　　中国人民解放军某部　杨澄
    无产阶级文化大革命的浪潮，正以排山倒海的雄伟气势，汹涌向前，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。在毛泽东思想的灿烂的阳光下，一小撮反党分子被揭穿了画皮，现了原形，露出了狰狞丑恶的嘴脸。现在，周扬这个修正主义文艺的“祖师爷”也被揪出来了，揪得好！这是无产阶级文化大革命又一重大的胜利，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    毛主席早在一九四二年发表的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中就教导我们说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。”
    阶级斗争的历史，一再地印证了毛主席这一光辉的论断。一切反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的牛鬼蛇神，总是千方百计地打着各色旗号，竭力抹煞文艺的阶级性，放出
  “超阶级”的毒雾，贩卖资产阶级、修正主义黑货，为资本主义复辟开路。自命为“马克思主义者”的周扬，在这个问题上，就这样公开叫嚷过：
      “……共鸣与阶级性的关系不大。任何一个阶级的艺术绝不只是给本阶级看，它是给所有阶级看的，引起所有的人的共鸣，……所以，艺术作品是任何一个阶级都可以接受的，一个阶级产生的作品不能只供本阶级欣赏，否则这个作品是失败的。”
    周扬贩卖的是什么货色，他是哪个庙里的“神”，难道还不清楚吗？
    毛主席说：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”
    任何一部文学艺术作品都是属于一定阶级的人创作出来的，他们的作品必然打着本阶级的“烙印”。既然对立的阶级有着根本不同的利害关系，那么他们的文艺也必然是根本对立的。怎么能想象资产阶级与无产阶级会有共同的语言呢？难道新编芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》能引起地主阶级的同情吗？难道电影《逆风千里》这株大毒草能够激发起革命战士的斗志吗？《雷锋日记》《王杰日记》《欧阳海之歌》出版以后，广大工农兵争相购阅，把这些书当成我们思想革命化的生动教材，我们说，这是鼓舞我们革命斗志的好书，可是这些书能引起周扬这伙资产阶级代言人的“共鸣”吗？能被他们“接受”吗？事情很清楚：无产阶级作品决不会引起资产阶级的共鸣，反之，资产阶级的作品也决不会引起无产阶级的共鸣！只要阶级和阶级斗争存在一天，能引起各个阶级共鸣的文艺就永远不会出现！周扬是在说梦话吗？不，周扬明目张胆地否认文艺的阶级性，目的是毒害群众，组织虾兵蟹将向党、向社会主义、向毛泽东思想、向革命人民进攻，为资本主义复辟进行舆论准备！
    在毛主席《讲话》的照妖镜下，周扬的原形毕露了。文艺界反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑线挖出来了！这是一件大好事！毛主席教导我们说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们是毛主席教导出来的革命战士，枪在我们手中，笔也在我们手中，世界上最锐利的武器——毛泽东思想武装了我们。我们一定要把反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的文艺黑线连根铲除，让毛泽东文艺思想的红旗永远高高飘扬！
