The friendship between Chinese and Japanese youth is unbreakable.

The Japanese Socialist Youth League has decided to participate in the second China-Japan Youth Friendship Festival.

The representative of the Japanese Democratic Youth League reiterated that they will not participate in this year's China-Japan Youth Friendship Festival.

	New China News Agency, July 12th: Japanese Socialist Youth League Chairman Fukaoka Hatsuo said at a reception held by the Japanese Youth Federation to see off the Chinese Youth Delegation to Japan on the 8th, "Strengthening the friendship and camaraderie between the peoples and youth of China and Japan is a powerful way to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people."

	Fukaoka expressed that the Japanese Socialist Youth League sincerely accepts the warm invitation from the three Chinese organizations (China-Japan Friendship Association, All-China Youth Federation, All-China Students' Federation) and decided to participate in the second China-Japan Youth Friendship Festival.

	He said, "Only a small number of people are unwilling to participate in the second China-Japan Youth Friendship Festival."

	He said, "If one does not support this youth friendship festival, one cannot talk about opposing the common enemy of the two peoples, the U.S. imperialists; one cannot talk about strongly supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people."

	Japanese Youth Federation Vice Chairman Narasaki Yuji said at the reception that the first China-Japan Youth Friendship Festival achieved great success, and today we have received the invitation from the three Chinese organizations. We enthusiastically accept this invitation and will participate in the second China-Japan Youth Friendship Festival.

	He said, "We will fight to the end against all attempts to obstruct China-Japan friendship and strive to strengthen the friendship between the peoples and youth of China and Japan."

	Chinese Youth Delegation to Japan leader Wen Chi said in his speech that he warmly welcomes the Japanese friends' decision to accept the invitation to participate in the second China-Japan Youth Friendship Festival.

	He said, "China-Japan friendship is the mainstream, and this trend is unstoppable. The friendship between the peoples and youth of China and Japan is unbreakable. Chinese youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought will forever be friends with Japanese friends, developing friendship in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and in supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people."

	The representative of the Japanese Democratic Youth League reiterated at the reception the statement made by the leader of this league in the Japanese Communist Party's central organ, the Red Flag, on the 6th, stating that the Japanese Democratic Youth League will not participate in this year's China-Japan Youth Friendship Festival.

	Socialist Party Diet member Okada Haruo, Socialist Party Youth Bureau Chief and Diet member Nara Kiyoshi, Japan-China Friendship Association Secretary-General Miyoshi Kazuo, Tokyo Laborers' Music Federation Chairman Okamoto Hiroshi, and film critic Urikawa Tadashi attended the reception.

	New China News Agency, Tokyo, July 12th: The Chinese Youth Delegation to Japan, led by Wen Chi, concluded its friendly visit to Japan, carrying the fighting friendship of the Japanese people and youth, and departed from Tokyo by plane at noon on the 11th to return to their home country.

　　中日青年的友谊是任何人也破坏不了的
　　日本社会主义青年同盟等决定参加第二届日中青年友好大联欢
　　日本民主青年同盟代表重申将不参加今年日中青年友好大联欢
    新华社十二日讯日　本社会主义青年同盟委员长深田肇，八日在日本青年团协议会举行的欢送中国青年访日代表团的酒会上说：“加强日中两国人民和青年的友好联欢，正是加强反对美帝国主义的斗争；正是有力地支持越南人民的斗争。”
    深田表示，日本社会主义青年同盟热诚地接受中国三团体（中日友协、全国青联、全国学联）的亲切邀请，决定参加第二届日中青年友好大联欢。
    他说：“不愿意参加第二届日中青年友好大联欢，仅仅是一小部分人。”
    他说：“如果不赞成这种青年友好大联欢，就谈不上反对两国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义；谈不上有力地支持越南人民的斗争。”
    日本青年团协议会副会长成泽勇记在酒会上致词中说，去年日中青年友好大联欢取得了重大成就，今天我们已接到中国三团体的邀请，我们满腔热忱地接受这一邀请，参加第二届日中青年友好大联欢。
    他说，我们将与阻碍日中友好的一切企图斗争到底，为加强日中两国人民和青年友谊而努力。
    中国青年访日代表团团长文迟在讲话中，对日本朋友决定应邀参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢表示热烈欢迎。
    他说，中日友好是主流，这一潮流是阻挡不住的，中日两国人民和青年的友好是任何人也破坏不了的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国青年将同日本朋友世世代代友好下去，在反对美帝国主义的斗争中，在支持越南人民的斗争中，把友谊发展下去。
    日本民主青年同盟代表在酒会上的讲话中，重申了这个同盟的负责人六日在日本共产党中央机关报《赤旗报》上发表的谈话，表示日本民主青年同盟不参加今年日中青年友好大联欢。
    社会党众议院议员冈田春夫、社会党青少年局局长、众议院议员楢崎弥之助、日中友协事务局长三好一、东京勤劳者音乐协议会委员长冈本弘、电影评论家瓜生忠夫等出席了酒会。
    新华社东京十二日电　由文迟率领的中国青年访日代表团结束了对日本的友好访问，满载日本人民和青年的战斗友谊，十一日中午乘飞机离开东京回国。
    到机场欢送代表团的，有日本青年团协议会、日中友好协会、社会主义青年同盟、日本工会总评议会青年对策部等团体负责人以及参加第一届中日青年友好大联欢的日本朋友。
    廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所代表陈抗等也到机场欢送。
    代表团是在六月二十五日到达东京的，在日本各地进行访问时，同日本青年朋友进行了广泛接触，加深了中日两国人民和青年之间的了解和友谊。
