Leaders of many factories and enterprises in the industrial, transportation, and construction sectors of Hefei City have followed the teachings of Chairman Mao's essay "Care for the Masses' Livelihood, Pay Attention to Methods of Work." They are striving to do a good job in preventing heatstroke and reducing temperatures, caring for workers' lives from various aspects, and ensuring workers' safety and production during the summer.

Leaders of various factories and enterprises have taken different measures. Some have gone to high-temperature workshops to participate in labor; some have sent refreshing drinks to the production front lines; and some have simplified meetings to ensure that workers can rest well.

Many factories and enterprises have fully utilized their heatstroke prevention and temperature reduction equipment. For example, the high-temperature workshops in the First Agricultural Machinery Factory have implemented temperature reduction measures, keeping the workshop temperature around 36 degrees Celsius.

    确保夏季工人安全生产
    合肥工厂企业注意防暑降温
    合肥市工业、交通、建筑系统许多工厂企业的领导干部，遵照毛主席《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》一文的教导，努力做好防暑降温工作，从多方面关心职工生活，确保夏季工人安全生产。
    各工厂企业的干部们，有的到高温车间去参加劳动；有的把清凉饮料送到生产第一线；有的设法精简会议，保证工人能够休息得好。
    许多工厂企业的防暑降温设备，现在已经充分发挥作用。农机一厂的高温车间采取降温措施后，车间温度保持在摄氏三十六度左右。
