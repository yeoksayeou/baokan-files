The People's Republic of China's Premier Zhou Enlai sent a telegram on July 28 to congratulate the 12th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, which opened in Tokyo on July 30. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the 12th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs:

On the occasion of the opening of the 12th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, I, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, extend warm congratulations to the conference, express high respect to the delegates from various countries and to the Japanese people, and express deep sympathy and condolences to the victims and families of the victims of the atomic and hydrogen bombs in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Bikini.

The Japanese movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs has a glorious tradition. Previous conferences have raised the banner of opposing U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war, the banner of opposing the surrenderism and splitism of the Soviet revisionist leadership, and the banner of supporting the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These actions have earned the deep sympathy and broad support of the Japanese people and the people of the world. We believe that as long as this conference continues to raise these banners of struggle, strengthens unity, and adheres to and carries forward the correct direction of previous conferences, it will certainly further inspire and strengthen the anti-imperialist struggle of the Japanese people and the people of the world, making new contributions to the realization of the comprehensive prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and to the defense of world peace.

It is well known that the threat of nuclear war comes from U.S. imperialism. It has always brandished nuclear weapons to intimidate the peoples of various countries. It continues to develop and mass-produce nuclear weapons and is constantly expanding its nuclear bases around the world, especially those around China, intensifying nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats against China and other peace-loving countries. At the same time, U.S. imperialism is colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership to actively promote the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty," attempting to consolidate their nuclear monopoly and deprive peace-loving countries of the right to develop nuclear weapons to resist nuclear threats. This is another big deception following the Moscow Three-Power Treaty. In the struggle to realize the comprehensive prohibition of nuclear weapons and the prevention of nuclear war, the people of the world must thoroughly expose and smash this evil plot.

This evening at 10:30 PM, after Liu Ningyi, the leader of the delegation, and all members of the delegation got off the plane, the crowds from various sectors enthusiastically applauded, expressing their welcome and sympathy. The Young Pioneers presented fresh flowers to all members of the delegation. The faces of the people still bore expressions of anger, strongly protesting the serious crimes committed by the Japanese government of Sato and its various old and new partners in destroying the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan.

Those who came to the airport to welcome the delegation this evening included Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, Zhao Yimin, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, Nan Hanchen, Vice Chairman of the China-Japan Friendship Association, and leaders from various people's organizations, including Ma Shugu, Kang Yonghe, Gu Daizhen, Zhang Tianmin, Di Zicai, Huang Minwei, Wang Jiyang, Li Shubin, Chen Yu, Shao Jingwa, Liu Qingyang, Wu Yunfu, Yong Longgui, Wang Jiren, Wang Chuanbin, Qian Dawai, and Wu Shaozu.

Japanese friends who came to the airport to welcome the delegation included Nishisonoji Koichi and others. The Japanese friends shook hands warmly with Liu Ningyi and others and expressed their deep regret and indignation at the unreasonable behavior of the Sato government in obstructing the Chinese delegation's visit to Japan.

At the airport, Liu Ningyi, the leader of the delegation, and the members of the delegation took a group photo with the leaders of various people's organizations in China and Japanese friends. The applause from the welcoming crowd lasted for a long time.

The Chinese delegation returned to Guangzhou by train this afternoon and was warmly welcomed by more than 300 people from various people's organizations in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City. Those who came to the station to welcome the delegation included Li Jaren, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, Luo Peiyuan, Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Branch of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and Liao Liming, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.

The Chinese government and the Chinese people have always advocated the comprehensive prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and have made unremitting efforts for this cause. However, only when peace-loving countries possess nuclear weapons and break the nuclear monopoly can nuclear war be prevented and nuclear weapons ultimately eliminated. The Chinese government has repeatedly solemnly declared to the world that China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons under any circumstances. The Chinese government has also proposed convening a summit of world leaders to discuss the issue of the comprehensive prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and to first reach an agreement on not using nuclear weapons. U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism only talk about banning nuclear tests and preventing nuclear proliferation, but they do not mention the most fundamental and crucial issue of banning the use of nuclear weapons. This precisely exposes the vicious nature of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation" in implementing nuclear monopoly, threatening and undermining the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations. We believe that as long as the people of the world strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, nuclear war can be stopped, and nuclear weapons can be prohibited.

The 12th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is being held at a time when U.S. imperialism has escalated its war of aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious stage. Opposing the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam is an important issue to be discussed at this conference. U.S. imperialism, in order to save its war of aggression in Vietnam from total failure, is increasing the number of troops sent to South Vietnam while colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership to promote the big conspiracy of "bombing to force negotiations." It has brazenly bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the second-largest city, Haiphong. This crazy and barbaric war action has aroused the indignation and strong protests of the people of the world. Chairman Ho Chi Minh issued a "Letter to the Nation" on July 17, calling on the Vietnamese people to unite and fight to defeat the American aggressors. This is a powerful response to the conspiracy of "bombing to force negotiations." The Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation is the focal point of the world's anti-U.S. struggle today and a major contribution to the struggle of the peoples of various countries to achieve and maintain national independence and defend world peace. Supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation is the sacred duty of all countries and peoples in the world who are engaged in anti-imperialist struggles and love peace. The Chinese people have made up their minds and are fully prepared to take any actions deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam at any time to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's just struggle until final victory.

To the greatest extent possible, the people of the world must isolate and strike U.S. imperialism by establishing the broadest and most genuine international united front against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. However, this united front must be based on the anti-imperialist unity of the people of the world. The modern revisionism centered on the CPSU leadership has long been colluding with U.S. imperialism and has become its accomplice. Therefore, they must not be included in the international anti-U.S. united front, and even less should any "joint actions" be carried out with them. Any proposal to carry out "joint actions" with them will only help them deceive the people of the world and cover up their traitorous faces of fake anti-imperialism and true surrender, fake support and true betrayal, and fake unity and true division.

In the struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression, the Japanese people have always been a glorious vanguard. The Japanese people are fighting vigorously and unremittingly to launch massive people's movements, striving for Japan's independence and democracy, demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the Japan-South Korea "Treaty," demanding the removal of U.S. military bases and the withdrawal of U.S. troops, demanding the return of Japan's territories of Okinawa and the Bonin Islands, and resolutely opposing the entry of U.S. nuclear submarines and nuclear aircraft into Japan. The Japanese people have launched a massive people's movement to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The Japanese people resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's revival of Japanese militarism and the use of Japan as a base for invading Vietnam and other Asian countries. The struggle of the Japanese people is a great support for the Chinese people and the people of the world in their struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression and for the defense of world peace.

The peoples of China and Japan have established fraternal combat friendship in their common struggle against U.S. imperialism. To strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialism, it is necessary to consolidate and develop this combat friendship and unity. This is the strong wish of the peoples of China and Japan and an irresistible historical trend. U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and Japanese militarist forces are doing everything they can to try to sabotage the combat unity of the peoples of China and Japan and to realize their plot of "containing China." All these efforts are in vain. The Japanese people, through their struggle, have seen clearly who their true friends are, who their false friends are, and who their enemies are. The Chinese people have always regarded the Japanese people as their close friends. On the forward path of the peoples of China and Japan fighting side by side against their common enemy, various obstacles and twists and turns have already appeared and will continue to appear. However, no matter what happens, no matter what storms arise, the Chinese people will steadfastly stand together with the Japanese people and with the peoples of the world, and strive together to oppose U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war and to defend world peace.

I wish the conference success.

Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai

    周总理电贺第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会
    只要继续高举反帝反修的战斗旗帜就能为禁止和销毁核武器作出新贡献
    全世界人民必须彻底揭露和粉碎美苏勾结策划所谓“防止核扩散条约”的罪恶阴谋。任何要同苏修搞“联合行动”的主张，
    都只会帮助他们欺骗世界人民，粉饰他们假反帝真投降、假支持真出卖、假团结真分裂的丑恶的叛徒面目。
    新华社三十日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来二十八日打电报祝贺三十日在东京开幕的第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会。贺电全文如下：日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会转第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会：
    值此第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会召开之际，我代表中国政府和中国人民，向大会表示热烈的祝贺，向出席大会的各国代表和日本人民致以崇高的敬意，向广岛、长崎和比基尼原子弹氢弹受害者和死难者家属表示深切的同情和慰问。
    日本禁止原子弹氢弹运动具有光荣的传统。历届大会高举反对美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的旗帜，高举反对苏联修正主义领导集团投降主义和分裂主义的旗帜，高举支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民民族解放斗争的旗帜，获得了日本人民和世界人民的深切同情和广泛支持。我们相信，本届大会只要继续高举这些战斗的旗帜，加强团结，坚持和发扬历届大会的正确方向，就一定能够进一步鼓舞和加强日本人民和世界人民的反帝斗争，为实现全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器，为保卫世界和平，作出新的贡献。
    举世周知，核战争的威胁来自美帝国主义。它一直挥舞核武器恐吓世界各国人民。它继续发展和大量生产核武器，并且不断扩大它在全世界的核基地，特别是在中国周围的核基地，加紧对中国和其它爱好和平的国家进行核讹诈和核威胁。与此同时，美帝国主义正在勾结苏联修正主义领导集团，积极策划所谓“防止核扩散条约”，企图巩固它们的核垄断地位，剥夺爱好和平的国家发展核武器抵抗核威胁的防御权利。这是继莫斯科三国条约之后的又一个大骗局。全世界人民在为实现全面禁止核武器和防止核战争的斗争中，必须彻底揭露和粉碎这一罪恶阴谋。
    今晚十时三十分，刘宁一团长和代表团全体成员走下飞机以后，各界群众热烈鼓掌，向他们表示欢迎和慰问。少先队员向代表团全体成员献了鲜花。人们的脸上还带着愤怒的表情，强烈地抗议日本佐藤政府及其形形色色的新旧伙伴破坏中日两国人民友好关系的严重罪行。
    今晚到机场欢迎的，有中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志，中国和委会副主席赵毅敏，中日友协副会长南汉宸，以及各人民团体的负责人马纯古、康永和、顾大椿、张天民、狄子才、黄民伟、王家扬、栗树彬、陈宇、邵井蛙、刘清扬、伍云甫、勇龙桂、王吉仁、王传斌、钱大卫、伍绍祖等。
    前往机场欢迎的日本朋友有西园寺公一等。日本朋友们同刘宁一等热烈握手，并且表示，他们对佐藤政府阻挠中国代表团前往日本的无理行为，感到十分遗憾和愤慨。
    在机场上，刘宁一团长和代表团成员，同我国各人民团体的负责人以及日本朋友合影。欢迎队伍中发出的热烈掌声，长久不停。
    中国代表团今天下午乘火车返回广州时，受到广东省、广州市各人民团体负责人和各界群众三百多人的热烈欢迎。到车站欢迎的有，中国和委会广东省分会主席李嘉人，中国和委会广州市分会主席罗培元，广东省总工会副主席廖立民等。
    中国政府和中国人民一贯主张全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器，并且为此进行了不懈的努力。但是，只有爱好和平的国家掌握了核武器，打破核垄断，才能防止核战争，才能最终消灭核武器。中国政府曾经多次向全世界郑重宣告，中国在任何时候，任何情况下，都不会首先使用核武器。中国政府还建议召开世界各国首脑会议，讨论全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器问题，首先就不使用核武器达成协议。美帝国主义和苏联修正主义只是侈谈什么禁止核试验和防止核扩散，而绝口不谈禁止使用核武器这一最根本最关键的问题。这恰恰暴露了“美苏合作”实行核垄断，威胁和破坏一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争的凶恶面目。我们相信，只要全世界人民加强团结，坚持斗争，核战争是可以制止的，核武器是可以禁止的。
    第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会，是在美帝国主义把侵略越南的战争上升到一个新的更严重的阶段的时候召开的。反对美国在越南的侵略战争，是这次大会要讨论的重要问题。美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南的侵略战争彻底失败的命运，在大量增派侵略军到越南南方的同时，正勾结苏联修正主义领导集团，推行“以炸迫和”的大阴谋，悍然轰炸越南民主共和国的首都河内和第二大城市海防。美帝国主义这一疯狂和野蛮的战争行动，激起了全世界人民的愤怒声讨和强烈抗议。胡志明主席已于七月十七日发表了《告全国同胞书》，号召越南人民团结一致坚持斗争，彻底打败美国侵略者。这是对“以炸迫和”阴谋的强有力回答。越南人民的抗美救国斗争，是当前世界人民反美斗争的焦点，是对世界各国人民争取和维护民族独立、保卫世界和平事业的重大贡献。支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，是全世界一切进行反帝斗争和爱好和平的国家和人民的神圣义务。中国人民已经下定了决心，做好了各种准备，随时随地采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动，坚决支援越南人民的正义斗争，直到取得最后胜利。
    全世界人民为了最大限度地孤立和打击美帝国主义，必须建立一个最广泛的、最真实的、反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线。但是，这条统一战线应当以全世界人民的反帝团结为基础。以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，早已同美帝国主义勾结在一起，成为美帝国主义的帮凶。因此，绝不能把他们包括在国际反美统一战线之内，更不能同他们搞什么“联合行动”。任何要同他们搞“联合行动”的主张，只会帮助他们欺骗世界人民，粉饰他们假反帝、真投降，假支持、真出卖，假团结、真分裂的叛徒面目。
    日本人民在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，一向是一支光荣的突击队。日本人民斗志昂扬，坚持不懈地开展规模巨大的群众运动，争取日本的独立和民主，要求废除日美“安全条约”和“日韩条约”，要求撤除美国军事基地和撤走美国军队，要求归还日本的领土冲绳和小笠原群岛，坚决反对美国核潜艇和核飞机进驻日本。日本人民掀起声势浩大的群众运动，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。日本人民坚决反对美帝国主义复活日本军国主义势力，利用日本作为侵略越南和亚洲各国的基地。日本人民的斗争，对于中国人民和世界人民反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争是一个极大的支持。
    中日两国人民在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中，建立了兄弟般的战斗友谊。为了加强反对美帝国主义的斗争，必须巩固和发展这种战斗友谊和团结。这是中日两国人民的强烈愿望，是不可阻挡的历史潮流。美帝国主义、现代修正主义和日本军国主义势力，千方百计地企图破坏中日两国人民的战斗团结，妄图实现“遏制中国”的阴谋。这一切都是枉费心机的。日本人民通过斗争实践，看清楚了谁是他们的真朋友，谁是他们的假朋友，谁是他们的敌人。中国人民一向把日本人民作为自己亲密的朋友。在中日两国人民反对共同敌人、并肩战斗的前进道路上，已经出现并且还会出现各种各样的障碍和曲折。但是，不管发生什么情况，不管出现什么风暴，中国人民将坚定不移地同日本人民团结在一起，同世界各国人民团结在一起，为反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策、为保卫世界和平而共同奋斗。
    祝大会成功。
