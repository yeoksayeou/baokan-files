    Turning Bad Things into Good Things
    Medical Orderly, Fú Kāngnián

    Anti-party and anti-socialist representatives of the bourgeoisie have been exposed one after another. We must have a deep understanding of this serious class struggle.

    Anti-party and anti-socialist representatives of the bourgeoisie have, for a long time, waved the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, shooting out countless poisoned arrows and sugar-coated bullets, making the ideological and cultural front a mess of smoke and stench. For a period of time, these monsters and demons have taken control, which is certainly not a good thing but a bad thing. However, we must "not only see the positive side of things but also the negative side." Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals across the country have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launched an unprecedented Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and struck back at the anti-party and anti-people black line. We have uprooted the "time bombs" buried within and dragged out the "tigers" sleeping beside us, planted the roots of Mao Zedong Thought deeper, made the socialist state more solid, swept away the arrogance of all bourgeois "authorities," and enabled workers, peasants, and soldiers to become the masters of culture. Isn't this an unprecedented great thing that the people of the whole country and the world are celebrating?

    Bad things and good things are a pair of contradictions. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The contradictory and opposing sides of things struggle with each other, and without exception, they transform into each other under certain conditions. Here, conditions are important." For example: if a person has a boil, it becomes infected, swollen, and painful, and it must be lanced to drain the pus. Lancing and draining the pus is painful, but after draining the pus and removing the infection, the boil will heal. The work of lancing and draining the pus is the condition for healing the boil.

    In the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we must strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and use Chairman Mao's standpoint, viewpoint, and method to analyze and criticize all monsters and demons. This is the fundamental condition for turning bad things into good things. When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals, the bourgeois and revisionist thoughts will have no foothold. This will turn bad things into good things. The more we consciously study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the storm of class struggle, the faster this transformation will be, and the faster we will promote the rapid development of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Therefore, we must firmly plant Mao Zedong Thought in our minds and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.

    把坏事变成好事
    卫生员　傅康年
    反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物陆陆续续被揭发出来了。对这场严重的阶级斗争，我们应当有深刻的认识。
    反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物，长期以来，打着“红旗”反红旗，放出了那么多的毒箭和糖弹，把一些思想文化阵地搞得乌烟瘴气，在一段时间里，让这些牛鬼蛇神专了政，这当然不是好事而是坏事。但是，我们“不但要看到事物的正面，也要看到它的反面”。在党中央和毛主席的领导下，全国工农兵和革命知识分子，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，开展了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，向反党反人民的黑线发起反击，挖掉了埋在内部的“定时炸弹”，揪出了睡在我们身边的“老虎”，把毛泽东思想的根子扎得更深了，使社会主义江山更牢固了，一切资产阶级“权威”的威风扫地了，工农兵开始成为文化的主人了，这不是开天辟地头一回、全国和全世界人民欢呼的大好事吗？
    坏事和好事是一对矛盾。毛主席教导我们：“矛盾着的对立的双方互相斗争的结果，无不在一定条件下互相转化，在这里，条件是重要的。”比方说：人身上害了疖子，化脓了，又肿又疼，必须开刀，才能去毒。开刀挤脓是痛的，但是挤了脓，去了毒，疖子才会好。这个开刀挤脓的工作就是治好疖子的条件。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，努力学习毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，用毛主席的立场、观点和方法分析和批判一切牛鬼蛇神，这就是把坏事变成好事的根本条件。毛泽东思想被广大的工农兵和革命知识分子掌握了，资产阶级、修正主义思想就没有了阵地。这就使坏事向好事方面转化。我们越是自觉地在阶级斗争的风浪里活学活用毛主席著作，就越能加快这种转化，就越能推动社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的飞速发展。因此，我们一定要把毛泽东思想在自己头脑里扎下深根，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
