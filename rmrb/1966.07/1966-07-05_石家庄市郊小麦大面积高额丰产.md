The cadres and commune members in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, creating a model of large-area high-yield wheat. Currently, the 70,000-plus mu of wheat in the suburbs have been harvested. According to initial threshing results, the yield per unit area has increased by more than 20 percent compared to last year.

Cadres and commune members generally feel that the summer harvest is a result of Mao Zedong Thought, achieved by following Chairman Mao's instructions to focus on ideological revolutionization.

In 1958, the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City raised the three red banners high, carried out extensive agricultural water conservancy construction, and basically achieved water control and electrification, creating good conditions for stable and high agricultural production. Over the past few years, the suburbs have made significant achievements in grain production. Some cadres and commune members thought that since the conditions were good, they became complacent and relaxed.

The Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China addressed this issue by mobilizing the masses to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to break down the "favorable conditions" and arrogant complacency. Many cadres and commune members studied Chairman Mao's works, established the idea of farming for the revolution, overcame complacency, and were determined to achieve a bumper harvest this year. Therefore, the wheat in the entire suburbs was sown and managed well. After a winter and a spring of hard work, a bumper harvest was finally achieved. Han Shuangxi, deputy chairman of the poor peasants' association of Shiqiao Brigade, Liuying Commune, said: "Conditions can be as good as they want, but if you don't listen to Chairman Mao's words, you won't be able to produce grain. In the past, we ate state grain every year. Chairman Mao told us to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong. We listened, and this year's wheat harvest was a success. In the past, farming depended on water and fertilizer, but in the future, it must depend on Chairman Mao's thought!"

    石家庄市郊小麦大面积高额丰产
    河北省石家庄市郊区的广大干部和社员，活学活用毛主席著作，创造了小麦大面积高额丰产典型。目前，市郊的七万多亩小麦已经登场，根据初步碾打情况来看，单位面积产量比去年增长百分之二十以上。
    干部和社员普遍反映，夏季丰收是靠毛泽东思想得来的，是他们根据毛主席的指示，狠抓思想革命化的结果。
    石家庄市郊区在一九五八年高举三面红旗，大搞农田水利基本建设，全郊区基本上实现了水利化、电气化，为农业的稳产高产创造了良好的条件。几年来，全郊区的粮食生产取得了很大的成绩。一些干部、社员认为条件好，因而产生了自满松劲情绪。
    中共石家庄市委针对社员、干部中的这个活思想，发动群众以毛泽东思想为武器，大破“条件优越论”和骄傲自满思想。许多社员、干部学习毛主席著作，树立了为革命种田的思想，克服了自满思想，决心争取今年丰收。因此，全郊区的小麦种得好，管理得好。经过一冬一春的苦干实干，终于获得了丰收。留营公社石桥大队贫协副主席韩双喜说：“条件千好万好，不听毛主席的话，也打不来粮食。过去我们年年吃国家的粮食，毛主席让我们发扬愚公移山的革命精神，我们听了，今年的小麦就丰收了。过去种地靠水、肥，今后必须靠毛主席思想才行！”
