		At the very moment when American imperialism brazenly bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army annihilated an entire tank and armored vehicle unit of the U.S. First Infantry Division in Tuyen Duc Province. The news of victory is exhilarating. We warmly congratulate the South Vietnamese people on their great victory in the anti-American, national salvation battlefield. This is another severe punishment that the South Vietnamese people have meted out to the American aggressors.

		The new victory of the South Vietnamese people once again proves that in the South Vietnamese battlefield, the truly powerful are the South Vietnamese people, not the American aggressors and their lackeys. Although the American aggressors have been continuously sending in troops and "escalating," in reality, they are extremely weak. The American aggressors suffered one defeat after another in the dry season in South Vietnam, and now, shortly after the rainy season began, they have again been struck a heavy blow by the iron fist of the South Vietnamese people. The facts show that the South Vietnamese people are growing stronger with each battle; they not only have the ability to shatter the American aggressors' repeated "sweeps" and attacks but can also wipe out entire units of the American aggressor forces. The current situation in the South Vietnamese war is increasingly unfavorable for American imperialism.

		The Johnson administration is brandishing bombs and viciously blackmailing the people of North Vietnam, attempting to force a "negotiated settlement." This will not succeed. The heroic Vietnamese people are not to be intimidated or frightened by any means of American imperialism. The barbaric crime of American air pirates bombing Hanoi and Haiphong can only arouse the indignation of the 31 million Vietnamese people, only strengthening their great resolve to defeat the American aggressors, liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the country. The victory of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army in annihilating an entire U.S. armored unit in Tuyen Duc Province is a powerful response to the Johnson administration's policy of "gradual escalation."

    严惩美国侵略者
    本报评论员
    正当美帝国主义悍然轰炸河内和海防的时候，南越解放军在土龙木省全歼美军第一步兵师的一个坦克和装甲车战团。捷报传来，振奋人心。我们热烈祝贺南越人民在抗美救国战场上取得的这一巨大胜利。这是南越人民对美国侵略强盗又一次严厉的惩罚。
    南越人民的新胜利，再一次证明，在南越战场上，真正强大的是南越人民，而不是美国侵略者及其走狗。美国侵略者虽然不断增兵，不断“升级”，实际上却十分虚弱。美国侵略者在南越旱季中刚刚遭到接二连三的惨败，现在雨季开始不久，又遭到南越人民铁拳的沉重打击。事实表明，南越人民越战越强，不仅有能力粉碎美国侵略者一次又一次的“扫荡”和进攻，而且能够整团整团地吃掉美国侵略军。当前南越战争的形势，对美帝国主义是越来越不妙了。
    约翰逊政府挥舞着炸弹，穷凶极恶地对越南北方人民进行讹诈，妄图压出一个“和谈”的局面来，这是办不到的。英雄的越南人民，是美帝国主义的任何手段也压不服、吓不倒的。美国空中强盗轰炸河内和海防的野蛮罪行，只能激起三千一百万越南人民的同仇敌忾，只能增强他们打败美国侵略者、解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的伟大决心。南越解放军在土龙木省全歼美军一个装甲战团的胜利，就是对约翰逊政府“逐步升级”的讹诈政策的最有力的回答。
