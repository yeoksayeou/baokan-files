The Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China held a meeting to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely denounce the black gang leader of the literary and artistic circles, Zhou Yang. The meeting unanimously declared that they would thoroughly uproot the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought revisionist literary and artistic black line represented by Zhou Yang, completely eliminate the poison of this counter-revolutionary black line, and resolutely seize and firmly occupy all positions usurped by Zhou Yang and his gang.

The New China News Agency reported on July 28 that the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China recently held a meeting to denounce the heinous crimes of Zhou Yang, the black gang leader of the literary and artistic circles, who is anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought.

The meeting was presided over by Zhang Pinghua, Vice Minister of the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China.

The attendees exposed a large amount of evidence proving that Zhou Yang is a representative of the bourgeoisie who has infiltrated the party, a thoroughgoing counter-revolutionary revisionist, and the chief culprit of the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black line in the literary and artistic circles. This cunning conspirator, who waves the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, has consistently used counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics since the 1930s to the 1960s, strenuously opposing Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and art, and stubbornly promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line. At the same time, he has been actively recruiting and collaborating, forming a counter-revolutionary revisionist clique with Lin Mo Han, Xia Yan, Tian Han, Yang Han Sheng, and Shao Yuan Lin as the core, and usurping the leadership positions in the literary and artistic circles. They used these positions to corrupt and sabotage our literary and artistic teams, carrying out extensive "peaceful evolution," and engaging in heinous anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities, plotting to usurp party power and restore capitalism. Zhou Yang's black hands not only reached into the literary and artistic circles but also into the fields of education, academia, publishing, and other ideological domains. The attendees were filled with righteous indignation and unanimously declared that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly expose all of Zhou Yang's evil activities, thoroughly uproot the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line represented by Zhou Yang, completely eliminate the poison of this black line, and resolutely seize and firmly occupy all positions usurped by Zhou Yang and his gang.

Zhou Yang has consistently waved the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, consistently using the counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics of pretending to be a leftist while being a rightist; ironclad facts prove that he is a political thief, a counter-revolutionary conspirator, and a revisionist.

From the 1930s to the 1960s, Zhou Yang has always self-proclaimed himself as the "commander" of the Chinese revolutionary literary and artistic movement, dressing himself up as the "theorist of the party's literature and art," the "highest authority" in the literary and artistic circles, and the representative of the "correct line" in the literary and artistic circles. At the National Conference of Active Young Amateur Literary Creation in 1965, he gave a lengthy speech, "summarizing" the "experience" of major struggles on the literary and artistic front since the founding of New China. The attendees at the meeting used a large amount of facts to angrily tear off Zhou Yang's mask, exposing his counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics of waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, playing one game in public and another in private, and his bourgeois conspiratorial ugly face of cheating everywhere. After our country's revolution entered the socialist stage, the major struggles we have waged on the cultural front, such as the criticism of the film "Wu Xun," the criticism of "Research on the Dream of the Red Chamber," the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, the struggle against the right-wing bourgeoisie, and this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, were all personally led by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. These major struggles were all confrontations between the Marxist-Leninist, Mao Zedong Thought literary and artistic line on one side and the literary and artistic black line represented by Zhou Yang on the other. Zhou Yang harbored deep hatred for these major struggles led by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In the critical moments of these struggles, he always firmly stood on the side of the right-wing bourgeoisie and counter-revolutionary revisionism, singing the opposite tune to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and joining the right-wing elements and counter-revolutionaries in their frenzied attacks on the party and socialism. However, when Zhou Yang realized that his counter-revolutionary conspiracy could not succeed, he immediately changed his disguise, transforming himself into a "hero" figure against Hu Feng and the right-wing elements, shamelessly appropriating the fruits of victory and recording them in his "merit book," reaping political capital. In the spring of 1957, anti-China and anti-communist dark clouds rolled in both domestically and internationally, and ghosts and monsters emerged. Zhou Yang was a vanguard of the right-wing bourgeoisie. He gave speeches everywhere, fanning the flames, and used the most vicious language to attack the party's leadership, attack the dictatorship of the proletariat, distort the party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and openly advocate for the establishment of "joint publications," fighting for freedom of speech and leadership for counter-revolutionaries and right-wing elements, attempting to achieve the restoration of capitalism. Many right-wing elements in the literary and artistic circles, incited by Zhou Yang, rose up and launched a frenzied attack on the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Soon, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the entire country launched a powerful counterattack against the right-wing elements. The opportunistic Zhou Yang, seeing the trend was not in his favor, immediately usurped the leadership of the anti-rightist struggle in the literary and artistic circles. A right-wing bourgeoisie thus disguised himself as a "hero" in the anti-rightist struggle in the literary and artistic circles. In the struggle against modern revisionism, Zhou Yang played the same tricks. At the Third National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers in 1960 and the Fourth Enlarged Meeting of the Philosophy and Social Sciences Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1963, as the presiding officer, Zhou Yang raised the banner of anti-revisionism, singing high praises of anti-revisionism, and dressing himself up as an "anti-revisionist fighter." In reality, as with all major struggles, he played a double game, saying one thing in the meeting and another thing in small meetings and outside the meeting; he was a person in public but a ghost in private. At the same time as he gave his anti-revisionist speech, Zhou Yang peddled a large amount of revisionist black goods to the literary, academic, and educational circles, launching vicious attacks on the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. At the Third Congress of Literary and Art Workers, Zhou Yang shouted on the surface that he wanted to criticize bourgeois and revisionist literature and art, but behind the scenes, he colluded with Lin Mo Han to promote and advocate for the screening of films that spread capitalist and revisionist poisons. The Fourth Enlarged Meeting of the Philosophy and Social Sciences Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was held under the direct care of the Central Committee. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave an important speech to the representatives, calling on philosophy and social science workers to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and clearly instructing that philosophy and social sciences must take anti-modern revisionism as the guiding principle. The cunning and treacherous Zhou Yang, on the one hand, plagiarized the important instructions of the Central Committee, giving an anti-revisionist speech at the meeting to reap political capital for himself, and on the other hand, in small meetings or outside the meeting, he spread counter-revolutionary black goods that were diametrically opposed to the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions, openly inciting the academic circles to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, resist the anti-revisionist struggle, and spread reactionary fallacies such as "reading books is anti-revisionism," "archaeology is a contribution to anti-revisionism," and "performing 'The Drunken Beauty' is in line with anti-revisionism." Ironclad facts prove that Zhou Yang is such a political thief, a counter-revolutionary conspirator, and a revisionist.

The attendees exposed that Zhou Yang had begun his conspiratorial activities as a political opportunist as early as the 1930s. He consistently carried out the bourgeois literary line, acting as an agent of the bourgeoisie within the party, and was a forger of history and a liar. In the 1930s, he first proposed the bourgeois literary slogan of "National Defense Literature," which was opposed to Lu Xun's proletarian literary slogan of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War of the Masses." At the same time, he and his gang also practiced sectarianism and factionalism in organization, attacking the great flag-bearer of the left-wing literary movement, Lu Xun, splitting and destroying the left-wing literary movement. Lu Xun fought a principled battle against the bourgeois literary line represented by Zhou Yang and the "National Defense Literature" slogan proposed by Zhou Yang. Chairman Mao made a conclusion on this in the early 1940s, highly praising Lu Xun's contributions to the new cultural movement and criticizing the bourgeois literary line represented by Zhou Yang. This bourgeois political opportunist, Zhou Yang, has long harbored resentment towards Lu Xun's struggle against him in the 1930s and Chairman Mao's historical conclusions on the literary movement of the 1930s. In his view, without overthrowing Lu Xun and cutting down the revolutionary red flag of Lu Xun, and without overturning Chairman Mao's historical conclusions on the literary movement of the 1930s, he could not establish his own monument and firmly grasp the leadership of the literary and artistic circles today. Therefore, he has been scheming to distort and reverse the history of the literary movement of the 1930s, using every opportunity to slander Lu Xun and seek to overturn the historical conclusions made by Chairman Mao on the literary movement of the 1930s.

After national liberation, Zhou Yang extolled the "merits" of the 1930s in various settings and strenuously sought to rehabilitate the "National Defense Literature" slogan. Under Zhou Yang's incitement and support, a black wind of extolling the 1930s swept through the literary and artistic circles, and many representatives of the literary and artistic black line of the 1930s came out to establish their own reputations and to promote Zhou Yang. They used every platform and opportunity to shout loudly about the need to inherit the traditions of the 1930s and viciously attack Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and art.

The attendees angrily exposed that Zhou Yang had consistently opposed Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and art and stubbornly resisted the implementation of Chairman Mao's literary line. By 1962, when domestic and foreign class enemies were frenziedly anti-China, he had reached the height of madness. He brazenly put forward a complete and systematic revisionist literary program, concocting the "Ten Articles on Literature and Art," and thoroughly distorting the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers established by Chairman Mao. Zhou Yang absurdly claimed that the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers had "become outdated," and therefore the "entire people," including the bourgeoisie, should all be the objects of our literary service. The attendees pointed out that Zhou Yang's "literature and art for the whole people" slogan is a direct continuation of his "National Defense Literature" slogan and "literature of the whole nation" theory proposed in the 1930s, and is directly in response to Khrushchev's reactionary slogan of the "state of the whole people" and the "party of the whole people." It is a product of Khrushchev's modern revisionist political line. Zhou Yang's advocacy of the fallacy of "literature and art for the whole people" is aimed at transforming proletarian revolutionary literature and art into bourgeois and revisionist literature and art, preparing the spiritual conditions for the restoration of capitalism. Chairman Mao taught us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." In a class society, every class must establish literature and art that serve the interests of their own class, and literature and art that can be accepted by all classes and resonate with all classes do not actually exist. Zhou Yang's theory of "literature and art for the whole people" is a genuine revisionist product.

The attendees exposed that Zhou Yang deliberately distorted the party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," turning this extremely firm class policy into a "free competition" and "free discussion." He vigorously advocated the revisionist line formulated by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, using the anti-Stalin and anti-"cult of personality" evil winds stirred up by Khrushchev to promote bourgeois liberalization, inciting and supporting the emergence of ghosts and monsters, spreading poisonous weeds, and attacking the party.

The attendees listed a large number of Zhou Yang's peddled bourgeois reactionary literary views to prove that he is the most concentrated representative of bourgeois, revisionist literary thought and so-called "literature of the 1930s" and all reactionary literary thoughts. Zhou Yang deliberately obscured people's class nature, advocating bourgeois humanism; he opposed Marxist-Leninist epistemology, promoting bourgeois idealist "imaginary thinking theory"; he vigorously opposed the use of Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding direction for literary creation, absurdly claiming that literary creation "starting from the main theme" is the root cause of formulaic and conceptual writing; he opposed Chairman Mao's proposed method of combining revolutionary realism with revolutionary romanticism, vigorously advocating bourgeois critical realism and the "write what you see" theory, exposing the so-called "dark side" of socialist society; he vigorously opposed the writing of ideal workers, peasants, and soldiers heroes, peddling the theory of "intermediate characters"; he vigorously opposed writers and artists from expressing the great era of Mao Zedong, opposing the writing of major themes, using the pretext of "theme determines" to advocate for writers and artists to have "full freedom" in choosing themes, and emphasizing the creation of so-called "harmless," "interesting," and "elevating appreciation level and interest" works; he opposed literature and art serving proletarian politics, advocating the theory of "indirect cooperation," fundamentally changing the subordinate relationship of literature and art to politics; he fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's principle that literary criticism should first be political and secondly artistic, absurdly claiming that "art is decisive," and "art is first, politics is second." The attendees pointed out that these reactionary bourgeois literary views of Zhou Yang must be thoroughly criticized and thoroughly eliminated from their influence and poisoning of the literary and artistic circles and the masses.

Another crime of Zhou Yang's opposition to Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and art is his vigorous advocacy of worshipping foreign cultures and resisting the socialist transformation of literature and art. Since liberation, the reason why the stage of Chinese drama has been dominated by emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, dead people, and foreigners for a long time is due to the instigation and advocacy of the literary and artistic black gang led by Zhou Yang for feudal, capitalist, and revisionist literature and art. Zhou Yang's frenzied advocacy of feudal, capitalist, and revisionist literature and art is fundamentally aimed at resisting and eliminating proletarian literature and art, allowing all ghosts and monsters to emerge, allowing all poisonous weeds to spread, and corrupting the souls and wills of revolutionary people to achieve the restoration of capitalism.

The attendees angrily exposed that Zhou Yang, in order to ensure the smooth implementation of his counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line, used his usurped position as Vice Minister of the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China to implement a revisionist organizational line. He used every means to recruit and collaborate, forming and expanding his counter-revolutionary revisionist black gang. Since the founding of New China, Zhou Yang has extensively recruited traitors, collaborators, right-wing elements, counter-revolutionaries, bourgeois reactionary literati, and remnants of the old society, extensively appointing the big shots of the literary and artistic black line of the 1930s such as Xia Yan, Tian Han, Yang Han Sheng, and Shao Yuan Lin to leadership positions in the Ministry of Culture and various departments of the literary and artistic circles, implementing the black line dictatorship led by Zhou Yang. Zhou Yang also used the despicable tactic of deceiving superiors and subordinates, using the name of the Central Propaganda Department to appoint Tian Han and Yang Han Sheng as the party group secretaries of the Drama Association and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, respectively. The Drama Association and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles were thus controlled for more than a decade by the two "black secretaries" Tian Han and Yang Han Sheng. For these ghosts and monsters, Zhou Yang not only protected them politically, cared for them in their work, but also cared for them in their lives. For example, the notorious and extremely reactionary traitor Zhou Zuoren, the right-wing elements Ding Ling and Chen Qixia, all became the objects of Zhou Yang's protection. Zhou Yang's favorite disciple and evil element Kong Jue, while in labor reform, wrote a letter to Zhou Yang requesting early release, and Zhou Yang not only agreed to his request but also appointed him as an editor at the Rural Reading Materials Publishing House, allowing this extremely ugly soul to poison the laboring people again. These pieces of evidence fully prove that Zhou Yang is the representative of landlord class elements, bourgeois elements, and degenerate elements.

Zhou Yang, on the one hand, recruited and collaborated, forming a counter-revolutionary revisionist clique and usurping the leadership of the literary and artistic circles; on the other hand, he peddled the revisionist black goods of the "three famous" policy of famous writers, directors, and actors, and the "three high" policy of high salaries, high manuscript fees, and high bonuses, advocating "opening windows" and urging literary and artistic workers to learn from capitalist and modern revisionist literature and art from abroad. This chief culprit of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique is thus using every means to corrupt our literary and artistic teams, attempting to cultivate a bourgeois literary and artistic team to corrupt our party, corrupt our people, and change the color of our country.

The attendees angrily denounced that Zhou Yang and his counter-revolutionary revisionist diehards had stubbornly resisted the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's series of extremely important instructions and severe criticisms on literary and artistic work in recent years, and frenziedly sabotaged the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In recent years, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have given a series of extremely important instructions and severe criticisms on literary and artistic work, but Zhou Yang has always refused to implement them, refused to examine himself, and strictly sealed them from being passed down, stubbornly insisting on promoting his counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, preparing spiritual conditions for the restoration of capitalism. In 1962, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "never forget class struggle" at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and also gave important instructions on literary and artistic work, pointing out that some people use novels to engage in anti-party activities, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Zhou Yang is a booster and supporter of anti-party novels. After the Eighth Plenary Session, he made every effort to exonerate and defend his anti-party words and deeds, and did not examine and criticize anti-party works. Zhou Yang has always opposed the promotion of the old and the new of feudalism and capitalism, and hypocritically advocated the so-called "three-in-one" policy of traditional plays, new historical plays, and modern plays, actually aiming to perform traditional plays and historical plays to squeeze out modern plays. In December 1963, Chairman Mao instructed that various forms of art—drama, folk art, music, fine arts, dance, film, poetry, and literature, etc.—have many problems, many people, and the socialist transformation in many departments has so far achieved very little. Many departments are still dominated by "dead people." Chairman Mao also said that many communists enthusiastically advocate feudal and capitalist art but are not enthusiastic about advocating socialist art, which is a strange thing. Zhou Yang did not examine the problems of the literary and artistic circles and his own problems according to Chairman Mao's instructions, but instead collected the so-called "new situation" of the literary and artistic circles and wrote a report to the Central Committee, singing the opposite tune to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. However, the report on the "new situation" was not yet completed when Chairman Mao, in June 1964, at the rectification of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and its affiliated associations, pointed out: These associations and the publications they control (it is said that there are a few good ones) have basically (not all people) not implemented the party's policies for fifteen years, acted as officials and lords, not approached the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and not reflected the socialist revolution and construction. In recent years, they have even slipped to the brink of revisionism. If they are not seriously reformed, they will inevitably become organizations like the Petofi Club in Hungary on some future day.

Chairman Mao's great instruction hit the sore spot of Zhou Yang and his gang. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist diehards of Zhou Yang and his gang still stubbornly resisted. Their conspiracy to create a fake rectification in the literary and artistic circles is a piece of evidence of their resistance to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and opposition to the cultural revolution.

In this so-called "rectification," Zhou Yang did not allow the public criticism of a group of anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black gang members in the literary and artistic circles, and for the few black gang members who had to be publicly criticized, such as Tian Han, Xia Yan, and Shao Yuan Lin, he played a trick of fake criticism and real protection, and set various rules and regulations for public criticism, restricting revolutionary masses from thoroughly exposing and criticizing these anti-party ghosts and monsters.

The attendees were extremely angry and denounced Zhou Yang's crimes of sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. After the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued important instructions on the criticism of "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," Zhou Yang, who had personally instigated and concocted "Hai Rui's Memorial," not only strenuously resisted and sealed the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao but also publicly presided over the writing of an article signed by Fang Qiu, using the evil method of compromise to cover up the anti-party essence of "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," attempting to limit this political struggle to the circle of "pure academic" discussion. The attendees unanimously pointed out that Zhou Yang's frenzied resistance to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and his various means of sabotaging the cultural revolution were all in vain. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary cultural and artistic workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are sweeping away all ghosts and monsters with a mighty force. Now Zhou Yang's reactionary face has been completely exposed in broad daylight, and it is necessary to thoroughly smash the Yama Palace, overthrow this living Yama, fight him down and make him stink, and never allow him to spread poison and harm the people again.

The meeting exposed a large amount of evidence showing that Zhou Yang, the black gang leader of the literary and artistic circles, was extremely frenzied in his opposition to the general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes, the leadership of the party, and the socialist system of our country.

Since 1958, under the inspiration of the general line for socialist construction proposed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the entire country have been full of vigor and enthusiasm, daring to think, daring to speak, daring to do, and daring to pioneer, making our socialist cause present an unprecedented situation of great leaps forward. It was at this moment that Zhou Yang, in coordination with the anti-China chorus of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary forces of various countries and the frenzied counterattack of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and right-wing elements at home, shot one poisonous arrow after another at the party. He absurdly claimed that whether the general line was correct "has not been proven" and slandered that the "all-out leap" of 1958 caused economic imbalances, and so on. In 1962, Zhou Yang, at the Dalian Creative Conference, vigorously advocated the single household responsibility system, absurdly claiming that "as long as the production is contracted to the household, production will rise." Zhou Yang's unrestrained poisoning was still not "free enough" and "lacking democracy," and he further directed his attacks at the leadership of the party and the dictatorship of the proletariat. He said: "In ancient times, there were the way of the king and the way of the hegemon. If socialism does not speak of democracy, it is the way of the hegemon." The attendees pointed out that for the reactionary bourgeois representatives like Zhou Yang, we must, as Chairman Mao taught, implement dictatorship and speak the way of the hegemon, allowing them to be well-behaved and not allowing them to speak and act recklessly.

The attendees expressed great indignation at Zhou Yang's vicious attacks on our great leader Chairman Mao and his heartless and insane slanders and defamations of the great Mao Zedong Thought. In order to defame the high prestige of Mao Zedong Thought among revolutionary people, Zhou Yang did not hesitate to distort Chairman Mao's brilliant theories and, like a mad dog barking at the sun, attempted to belittle Chairman Mao's great development of Marxism-Leninism. When revolutionary literary and artistic workers sang praises of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought with revolutionary passion, this black gang leader of the literary and artistic circles always jumped up in rage, suppressing and obstructing. The study of Chairman Mao's works by the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers also suffered vicious attacks from Zhou Yang. Zhou Yang even used the same methods as Khrushchev, after distorting the history of the cultural movement of the 1930s, attempting to distort the entire history of the party, opposing the highlighting of Mao Zedong Thought in the exhibition of revolutionary historical relics and the compilation of textbooks, opposing the reflection of Chairman Mao's consistently correct, brilliant, and outstanding leadership role in our revolutionary history as it is.

The attendees said that Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and all revolutionary people of the world, and Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. No matter how Zhou Yang and his ilk hate and curse, they cannot harm the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. They unanimously declared that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, thoroughly overthrow the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black gang led by Zhou Yang, and thoroughly expose and uproot the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line represented by Zhou Yang.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗愤怒声讨文艺界黑帮头子周扬
    一致表示一定要彻底挖掉周扬所代表的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的修正主义文艺黑线彻底干净地清除这条反革命黑线的流毒，坚决夺回和巩固地占领被周扬一伙窃踞的一切阵地
    新华社二十八日讯　中共中央宣传部最近举行会议，愤怒声讨文艺界黑线总头目周扬反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。
    会议由中共中央宣传部副部长张平化主持。
    到会同志揭露的大量事实证明，周扬是一个混进党内的资产阶级代表人物，是一个彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义者，是文艺界反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑线的罪魁祸首。这个打着“红旗”反红旗的大阴谋家，从三十年代到六十年代一贯玩弄反革命两面手法，竭力反对毛泽东文艺思想，顽固地推行反革命修正主义文艺路线。同时，他竭力招降纳叛，结党营私，纠集了林默涵、夏衍、田汉、阳翰笙、邵荃麟等反党老手，以这批文艺黑线代表人物为核心结成反革命修正主义集团，窃踞着文艺界的领导地位。他们利用这种地位，腐蚀和破坏我们的文艺队伍，大搞“和平演变”，疯狂地进行反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动，阴谋篡党夺权，实行资本主义复辟。周扬这双黑手，不仅触及文艺界，而且触及教育、学术、出版等意识形态领域的各个方面。到会同志义愤填膺，一致表示一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底揭露周扬的一切罪恶活动，彻底挖掉周扬所代表的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，彻底干净地清除这条黑线的流毒，坚决夺回和巩固地占领被周扬一伙窃踞的一切阵地。
    周扬一贯打着“红旗”反红旗，一贯玩弄假左派、真右派的反革命两面手法；铁的事实证明他是一个政治盗窃犯，反党的阴谋家，反革命修正主义分子
    从三十年代到六十年代，周扬一直自封为中国革命文艺运动的“主帅”，把自己打扮成“党的文艺理论家”，文艺界的“最高权威”和文艺界“正确路线”的代表。在一九六五年举行的全国青年业余文学创作积极分子大会上，他就曾大作报告，“总结”新中国成立以来文艺战线上历次重大斗争的“经验”。周扬在历次斗争中究竟扮演的是什么角色？到会的同志用大量的事实，愤怒地撕下了周扬的画皮，把他一贯打着“红旗”反红旗，一贯玩弄明一套暗一套，假左派、真右派的反革命两面手法，把他到处招摇撞骗，盗窃政治资本的资产阶级阴谋家的丑恶嘴脸，统统暴露在光天化日之下。在我国革命进入社会主义阶段以后，我们在文化战线上所进行的一系列重大的斗争，如对影片《武训传》的批判，对《〈红楼梦〉研究》的批判，对胡风反革命集团的斗争，反对资产阶级右派的斗争，以及这一次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命等等，都是党中央和毛主席亲自领导的。这些重大斗争都是以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的文艺路线为一方，同以周扬所代表的文艺黑线为另一方的针锋相对的斗争。周扬对党中央、毛主席亲自领导的这些重大斗争，怀着刻骨的仇恨。在历次斗争的紧要关头，他都坚决地站在资产阶级右派、反革命修正主义的立场上，同党中央和毛主席唱对台戏，跟右派分子、反革命分子一起猖狂地向党向社会主义进攻。但是，当周扬知道他的反革命阴谋不能得逞时，便马上乔装打扮，摇身一变，扮成反胡风、反右派的“英雄”人物，恬不知耻地贪天之功为己功，把斗争的胜利果实记在自己的“功劳簿”上，大捞政治资本。一九五七年春，国内外反华、反共的黑云翻滚，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，周扬就是资产阶级右派队伍中的一名急先锋。他到处演说，煽风点火，用最恶毒的语言，攻击党的领导，攻击无产阶级专政，歪曲党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，公然提倡兴办“同人刊物”，为反革命分子、右派分子争言论自由、争领导权，妄图实现资本主义复辟。文艺界的许多右派分子，在周扬的煽动下，闻风而起，向党中央和毛主席发动了猖狂进攻。不久，全国人民在党中央和毛主席领导下对右派分子进行了有力的反击，惯于见风使舵的周扬，一看势头不对，立刻窃取了文艺界反右派斗争的领导权。一个资产阶级大右派，就这样伪装成了文艺界反右派斗争的“英雄”。在反对现代修正主义的斗争中，周扬玩弄了同样的把戏。在一九六○年的中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会上，在一九六三年的中国科学院哲学社会科学部委员会第四次扩大会议上，作为会议主持人的周扬打起了反修旗号，大唱反修高调，把自己装成“反修斗士”。实际上，同历次重大斗争一样，他大耍反革命的两面手法，在大会上说的是一套，在小会和会外讲的又是一套；他明中装人，暗中是鬼。就在他大做反修报告的同时，周扬向文艺、学术、教育界倾销了大量的修正主义黑货，向党中央和毛主席进行了恶毒的攻击。周扬在第三次文代会上，表面大喊要批判资产阶级和修正主义的文学艺术，会下却同林默涵一起策动和鼓吹放映宣扬资本主义和修正主义毒素的影片。中国科学院哲学社会科学部委员会第四次扩大会议是在中央直接关怀下召开的。中共中央副主席刘少奇同志在会上向代表做了重要讲话，号召哲学社会科学工作人员学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，明确指示哲学社会科学必须以反对现代修正主义为纲。阴险狡猾的周扬，一面剽窃党中央的重要指示，在大会上大做反修报告，为自己捞取政治资本，一面又在小会或会外散布与中央指示精神针锋相对的反革命黑货，公开煽动学术界反对毛泽东思想，抵制反修斗争，胡说什么“不能都去反修”，要“各得其所”，并且散布“读书就是反修”、“考古也是对反修的贡献”、“演《贵妃醉酒》也是配合反修”等等反动谬论。铁的事实证明，周扬就是这样一个政治盗窃犯，反党的阴谋家，反革命修正主义分子。
    周扬早在三十年代就开始政治投机家的阴谋活动，一贯执行资产阶级文艺路线，充当了资产阶级在党内的代理人
    到会同志揭露：周扬早在三十年代就开始政治投机家的阴谋活动了。他不仅一贯执行资产阶级文艺路线，做了资产阶级在党内的代理人，而且是一个伪造历史、制造谎言的骗子手。在三十年代，他首先提出
  “国防文学”这个资产阶级的文学口号，同鲁迅提出的“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个无产阶级的文学口号相对立。同时，他和他的一伙还在组织上实行关门主义和宗派主义，攻击左翼文艺运动的伟大旗手鲁迅，分裂和破坏左翼文艺运动。鲁迅对以周扬为代表的资产阶级文艺路线和周扬提出的“国防文学”口号进行了原则性的斗争。毛主席在四十年代初期就对此作了结论，高度评价了鲁迅对新文化运动的贡献，批评了以周扬为代表的资产阶级文艺路线。周扬这个资产阶级政治野心家，对于三十年代鲁迅对他的斗争，对毛主席所做的关于三十年代文艺运动的历史结论，一直怀恨在心。在他看来，不打倒鲁迅，不砍倒鲁迅这面革命的红旗，不推翻毛主席对三十年代文艺运动所作的历史结论，他就不能为自己树碑立传，就不能稳固地把持今天文艺界的领导大权。于是，他处心积虑地篡改和颠倒三十年代文艺运动的历史，利用一切机会大肆污蔑鲁迅，为他所代表的“三十年代”资产阶级文艺路线翻案。
    全国解放以后，周扬在各种场合大肆宣扬“三十年代”的功绩，并竭力为“国防文学”口号翻案。在周扬的煽动和支持下，文艺界刮起了一股宣扬“三十年代”的黑风，许多“三十年代”文艺黑线的代表人物纷纷粉墨登场，为自己立传，为周扬捧场。他们利用一切阵地、一切机会，疯狂叫嚷要继承“三十年代”的传统，恶毒地攻击毛泽东文艺思想。
    周扬明目张胆地抛出一套完整的反革命修正主义的“全民文艺”纲领，全面篡改毛主席制定的为工农兵服务的文艺方向
    到会同志愤怒揭发，周扬一贯反对毛泽东文艺思想，顽固地抗拒执行毛主席的文艺路线，到一九六二年国内外阶级敌人猖狂反华时，达到了极端疯狂的地步。他明目张胆地抛出一套完整的系统的反革命修正主义文艺纲领，炮制了“文艺十条”，全面地篡改了毛主席制定的为工农兵服务的文艺方向。周扬胡说文艺为工农兵服务的方向“已经过时了”，因此包括资产阶级在内的“全体人民”都应该是我们文艺服务的对象。到会同志指出，周扬的“全民文艺”口号同他在三十年代提出的“国防文学”口号、“全民族文学”论是一脉相承的，是同赫鲁晓夫的“全民国家”、“全民党”的反动口号直接呼应的，它是赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义的政治路线的产物。周扬鼓吹“全民文艺”的谬论，目的就是要把无产阶级革命文艺演变成资产阶级、修正主义文艺，为复辟资本主义准备精神条件。毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”在阶级社会里，任何阶级都要建立为本阶级利益服务的文学和艺术，为所有阶级所接受、能引起所有阶级共鸣的文艺，实际上是根本不存在的。周扬的“全民文艺”论，是地地道道的修正主义货色。
    到会同志揭发，周扬蓄意歪曲党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，把这一极端坚定的阶级政策曲解成
  “自由竞赛”、“自由讨论”。他竭力鼓吹苏共二十次代表大会所制定的修正主义路线，借赫鲁晓夫大反斯大林、大反所谓“个人迷信”的妖风，疯狂地推行资产阶级自由化，煽动和支持牛鬼蛇神一齐出笼，大放毒草，向党进攻。
    到会同志列举周扬大量贩卖的资产阶级反动文艺观的黑货证明，他是资产阶级、修正主义文艺思想和所谓“三十年代”文艺等一切反动文艺思想的最集中的代表。周扬故意抹煞人的阶级性，鼓吹资产阶级人性论；他反对马克思列宁主义的认识论，宣扬资产阶级唯心主义的“形象思维论”；他竭力反对以毛泽东思想作为文艺创作的指导方向，胡说什么文艺创作“从主题思想出发”是导致公式化、概念化的根源；他反对毛主席提出的革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，大力提倡资产阶级的批判现实主义和“写真实”论，暴露社会主义社会的所谓“阴暗面”；他竭力反对写理想的工农兵英雄人物，大肆贩卖“中间人物”论；他竭力反对作家艺术家去表现伟大的毛泽东时代，反对写重大题材，以反“题材决定”论为名鼓吹作家艺术家要有选择题材的“充分自由”，并强调大搞所谓“无害的”、“有味的”、“能提高欣赏水平和欣赏兴趣”的作品；他反对文艺为无产阶级政治服务，提倡什么“间接配合”论，从根本上改变文艺对政治的从属关系；他猖狂地反对毛主席提出的文艺批评要以政治标准第一、艺术标准第二的原则，胡说什么艺术是“起决定作用的”，“艺术好才能政治第一”。到会同志指出，周扬的这些反动的资产阶级文艺观，必须彻底批判，彻底清除它对文艺界和群众的影响和毒害。
    周扬反对毛泽东文艺思想的另一条罪状是大肆鼓吹崇洋复古，抗拒对文艺的社会主义改造。解放以来，我国戏剧舞台所以被帝王将相、才子佳人、死人洋人长期统治，都是由于以周扬为首的文艺界黑帮策动和鼓吹封建主义、资本主义和修正主义文艺所造成的。周扬疯狂地鼓吹封建主义、资本主义和修正主义文艺的根本目的，是为了抵制和挤掉无产阶级文艺，让一切牛鬼蛇神出笼，让各种毒草泛滥，以腐蚀革命人民的灵魂和意志，实现资本主义的复辟。
    周扬推行一套反革命修正主义组织路线，千方百计招降纳叛，结党营私，在文艺界实行以周扬为首的黑线专政
    到会同志愤怒揭发，周扬为了保证他的反革命修正主义文艺路线的顺利推行，利用他所窃踞的中共中央宣传部副部长的领导职权，推行了一套反革命修正主义的组织路线。他千方百计地招降纳叛，结党营私，拼凑并扩大他的反革命修正主义黑帮。新中国成立以来，周扬大肆搜罗叛徒、汉奸、右派分子、反革命分子、资产阶级反动文人、遗老遗少等社会渣滓，大量起用“三十年代”文艺黑线的大将夏衍、田汉、阳翰笙、邵荃麟等人，把这批反党老手安插在文化部和文艺界各部门的领导岗位，实行以周扬为首的黑线专政。周扬还采取瞒上欺下的卑鄙手段，盗用中央宣传部名义，让田汉、阳翰笙分别担任剧协和文联党组书记职务。剧协和文联，就这样由田汉、阳翰笙两个
  “黑书记”专了十几年政。对于这些牛鬼蛇神，周扬不仅在政治上加以庇护，工作上给予照顾，生活上还给以无微不至的关怀。比如，臭名昭著、反动透顶的大汉奸周作人，右派分子丁玲、陈企霞，都成了周扬的庇护对象。周扬的得意门生、坏分子孔厥，在劳改时写信给周扬，要求提前释放，周扬不仅答应了他的要求，还把他安插在农村读物出版社当编辑，让这个灵魂极端丑恶的坏家伙又去毒害劳动人民。这些罪证，充分证明周扬是地主阶级分子、资产阶级分子和蜕化变质分子的代表。
    周扬一手招降纳叛，结党营私，窃夺文艺界领导大权；一手贩卖名作家、名导演、名演员的“三名主义”和高工资、高稿酬、高奖金的“三高政策”的修正主义黑货，提倡“打开窗户”，要文艺工作者以外国的资本主义、现代修正主义文艺为师。这个反革命修正主义集团的罪魁祸首，就是这样千方百计地腐蚀我们的文艺队伍，妄图培养一支资产阶级文艺队伍来腐蚀我们的党，腐蚀我们的人民，使我们的国家改变颜色。
    周扬一伙反革命修正主义死党，顽固地抗拒党中央和毛主席对文艺工作一系列的极为重要的指示和严厉的批评，疯狂地破坏无产阶级文化大革命
    近几年来，党中央和毛主席对文艺工作作了一系列极为重要的指示和严厉的批评，但周扬总是拒不执行，拒不检查，并且严密封锁不向下传达，顽固地坚持推行他的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，为资产阶级复辟准备精神条件。一九六二年，毛主席在党的八届十中全会上发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，对文艺工作也作了重要指示，指出有人利用写小说进行反党活动，是为资本主义复辟制造舆论。周扬是反党小说的吹捧者和支持者。他在十中全会以后为自己的反党言行极力开脱、辩解，对反党作品更不检查批判。周扬还一贯反对推封建主义、资本主义之陈，出社会主义之新，虚伪地提倡所谓传统戏、新编历史戏、现代戏“三者并举”，实际上是要大演传统戏、历史戏来挤掉现代戏。一九六三年十二月，毛主席指示说，各种艺术形式——戏剧、曲艺、音乐、美术、舞蹈、电影、诗和文学等等，问题不少，人数很多，社会主义改造在许多部门中，至今收效甚微。许多部门至今还是“死人”统治着。毛主席还说，许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不热心提倡社会主义的艺术，岂非咄咄怪事。周扬不仅不按照毛主席指示检查文艺界和自己的问题，反而搜集文艺界的所谓“新气象”给中央写报告，同党中央和毛主席唱对台戏。但是，“新气象”的报告尚未写完，毛主席于一九六四年六月在全国文联和所属各协会整风时又指出：这些协会和他们所掌握的刊物的大多数
  （据说有少数几个好的），十五年来，基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。
    毛主席的这一伟大指示，击中了周扬一伙人的痛处。可是，周扬一伙反革命修正主义死党，仍然负隅顽抗。他们在文艺界制造的假整风的阴谋，就是抗拒党中央和毛主席、反对文化革命的一个罪证。
    在这次所谓“整风”中，周扬对于文艺界一伙反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮，大都不准公开批判，而对田汉、夏衍、邵荃麟等少数几个不得不进行公开批判的黑帮分子，则玩弄一套假批判真包庇的花招，并为公开批判定了种种清规戒律，限制革命群众彻底揭发和批判这帮反党的牛鬼蛇神。
    到会同志十分愤怒地声讨了周扬破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪行。在党中央、毛主席作出关于批判《海瑞罢官》的重要指示以后，曾经亲手策动和炮制《海瑞上疏》的周扬，不仅竭力抵制和封锁党中央和毛主席的指示，而且公然主持撰写了署名方求的文章，用折衷主义的恶劣手法掩盖《海瑞罢官》的反党实质，企图把这场政治斗争限制在“纯学术”讨论的圈子里。到会同志一致指出，周扬如此疯狂地抗拒党中央和毛主席的指示，千方百计破坏文化大革命，完全是痴心妄想。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命文化艺术工作者，正以排山倒海之势，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。现在周扬的反动嘴脸已经完全暴露在光天化日之下，必须彻底砸碎阎王殿，打倒这个活阎王，把他斗倒斗臭，绝不能再让他到处放毒，危害人民。
    周扬配合帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派的反华大合唱和国内地富反坏右的疯狂反扑，猖狂反对总路线、大跃进和人民公社，反对党的领导和无产阶级专政
    声讨会上揭发的大量事实表明，周扬这个文艺黑线头目，反对社会主义建设总路线，反对大跃进和人民公社，反对党的领导和我国社会主义制度，是极其猖狂的。
    从一九五八年起，全国人民在党中央、毛主席提出的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，意气风发，斗志昂扬，敢想，敢说，敢做，敢闯，使我国社会主义事业出现了一个前所未有的大跃进的局面。就在这个时候，周扬配合帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派的反华大合唱和国内地富反坏右的疯狂反扑，向党射出了一支又一支的毒箭。他胡说什么总路线是不是正确“还没有得到证明”，造谣诬蔑“一九五八年的‘全面跃进’引起了经济失调”，等等。一九六二年，周扬在大连创作座谈会上大肆鼓吹单干风，胡说什么“只要包产到户，生产就上升”。周扬这样肆无忌惮地放毒，还嫌“不够自由”，“没有民主”，又进一步把进攻的矛头指向党的领导和无产阶级专政。他说：“古代有王道和霸道。社会主义如果不讲民主，就是霸道”。到会同志指出，我们对周扬之流的反动资产阶级代表人物，就是要象毛主席教导的那样实行专政，就是要对他们讲霸道，只许他们规规矩矩，不准他们乱说乱动。
    到会同志对周扬恶毒地攻击我们伟大的领袖毛主席，丧心病狂地诬蔑、诋毁伟大的毛泽东思想，表示极大的愤慨。周扬为了诋毁毛泽东思想在革命人民中的崇高威信，竟不择手段地歪曲毛主席的天才学说，同时象狂犬吠日一样妄图贬低毛主席对马克思列宁主义的伟大发展。当革命的文艺工作者满怀革命激情歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席、歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想时，这个文艺黑线头目总是暴跳如雷，进行压制和阻挠。工农兵群众学习毛主席著作，也遭到了周扬的恶毒攻击。周扬甚至采用和赫鲁晓夫同样的手段，在篡改了三十年代文化运动的历史以后，又妄图篡改整个党的历史，反对在我国革命历史的展品陈列中和教材编写中突出毛泽东思想，反对按照历史如实地反映毛主席一贯正确的、英明的、杰出的领导作用。
    到会同志说，毛主席是中国人民和全世界革命人民心中的红太阳，毛泽东思想是帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义，周扬之流无论怎样仇视、谩骂都无损于毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。他们一致表示，一定要高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同广大工农兵群众一道，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把以周扬为首的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮彻底打倒，把周扬所代表的一条反革命修正主义文艺黑线批深批透、彻底挖掉。
