In all fronts, striking hard against the U.S. imperialists' plot to increase troops and expand the war

In South Vietnam, military and civilian forces annihilate over 40,000 U.S. troops and destroy over 1,400 enemy aircraft in half a year

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 14th, the Liberation Communications Agency of South Vietnam reported: The Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam issued a news bulletin on the 6th stating that, according to incomplete statistics, the military and civilian forces of South Vietnam have engaged in nearly 9,000 large and small battles in the first half of this year, killing, wounding, and capturing nearly 112,000 enemy personnel, including 47,000 U.S. aggressors and their puppets. If the approximately 50,000 deserters and collective defectors from the puppet army are included, the total number of enemy personnel annihilated and disintegrated reaches 162,000.

The bulletin said that in the first half of this year, the annihilated enemy units included: 21 infantry battalions (including 10 battalions of U.S. troops), 8 armored battalions, 131 companies (including 26 companies of U.S. troops), and 150 platoons (including 15 platoons of U.S. troops). During this period, the military and civilian forces of South Vietnam also shot down and destroyed 1,429 enemy aircraft; destroyed and damaged over 1,100 enemy vehicles, including 530 M-113 and other types of tanks and amphibious armored vehicles; sank 22 enemy ships; blew up and destroyed 20 military trains; captured and forced the enemy to withdraw from 3 military strongholds, 42 outposts and sentry posts, and 47 bunkers; destroyed 133 bridges and 7 culverts; seized nearly 7,000 pieces of various weapons; and liberated 22 communes with tens of thousands of residents.

The bulletin pointed out that the U.S.-puppet clique cannot stop the growth of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam. On the contrary, the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam are becoming stronger and more victorious with each battle, growing rapidly. The bulletin said that the U.S. massive increase in troops to South Vietnam still cannot stop the collapse and disintegration of the puppet army and puppet regime, still cannot change the passive situation, but rather makes them more passive and in a more difficult situation.

The bulletin pointed out that the brilliant victories achieved by the military and civilian forces of South Vietnam in the first half of this year have extremely important strategic significance. The bulletin said that the military and civilian forces of South Vietnam have shattered all large and small military "sweeps" by the U.S.-puppet forces, putting the U.S.-puppet forces in an even more passive position. The U.S.-puppet clique has launched nearly 2,000 "sweeps" with a battalion or more in all regions of South Vietnam in the first half of this year, including more than 200 with the entire regiment and division, but they still cannot achieve their strategic intentions and are instead beaten to a standstill by the military and civilian forces of South Vietnam. They suffer losses ranging from hundreds to thousands or even entire battalions and regiments. The bulletin said that the military and civilian forces of South Vietnam have taken the initiative to attack the enemy on all battlefields from the central to the southern regions, striking the enemy's various transportation lines, attacking enemy strongholds and outposts, penetrating the enemy's rear, annihilating many of the enemy's combat forces, and forcing them to be on the defensive everywhere. Wherever the U.S. aggressors are stationed, there are encirclement zones to annihilate the Americans. These encirclement zones are expanding, the experience of annihilating the U.S. troops is becoming richer, and they are attracting the participation of a wide range of masses. In the northern part of Go Vap District, Cu Chi County, just the guerrilla forces of the encirclement zone to annihilate the Americans from January 24 to February 25 annihilated 2,210 enemy personnel, the vast majority of whom were U.S. aggressors; destroyed 17 vehicles, and shot down and damaged 8 aircraft. The number of attacks on airfields has also increased compared to 1965, destroying 600 aircraft and annihilating more than 3,000 enemy personnel. The bulletin said that the enemy's various water and land transportation lines are continuously being attacked and destroyed.

The bulletin said that the three types of armed forces of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam are continuously growing and rapidly developing in the course of the battle, increasingly gaining the advantage of attacking the enemy. The military and civilian forces of South Vietnam have annihilated the enemy, destroyed and shaken the enemy's "strategic hamlets," reduced the enemy-occupied areas, expanded the liberated areas, and liberated tens of thousands of people, achieving great results that have made the U.S.-puppet clique extremely panic-stricken.

The bulletin pointed out that the obvious facts of the past six months have further strengthened the confidence of the military and civilian forces of South Vietnam in future victory and have further proven that the aggressors and traitors cannot escape their doomed failure.

　　在各条战线上狠狠打击美帝增兵扩战阴谋
　　南越军民半年歼美军四万多毁敌机千四百多架
    据新华社河内十四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方解放武装力量指挥部六日发表新闻公报说，据不完全统计，越南南方军民今年上半年共进行大小战斗近九千次，打死打伤和俘虏敌人近十一万二千名，其中包括美国侵略军和帮凶军四万七千多名。如果连开小差和集体逃跑的约五万伪军计算在内，则被歼灭和瓦解的敌人总数达到了十六万二千名。
    公报说，今年上半年，被歼的敌军单位有：二十一个步兵营（其中美军占十个营），八个装甲营，一百三十一个连（美军占二十六个连），一百五十个排（美军占十五个排）。在上述期间，越南南方军民还击落和击毁敌机一千四百二十九架；击毁击伤敌人军车一千一百多辆，其中包括M—113和其他类型坦克以及两栖装甲车五百三十辆；炸沉敌舰艇二十二艘；炸翻和击毁军用火车二十列；攻克和迫使敌人撤出三个军事支区、四十二个据点、哨所和四十七个碉堡；破坏一百三十三座桥梁和七个涵洞；缴获各种武器近七千件；解放了拥有成十万居民的二十二个乡。
    公报指出，美伪集团阻止不了越南南方解放武装力量的壮大，相反地，越南南方解放武装力量越战越强，越强越胜，越加迅速成长。公报说，美国向南方大举增兵，仍然不能阻止伪军和伪政权的崩溃和瓦解，仍然不能改变被动局面，相反地，使它们更加被动和陷于窘境。
    公报指出，今年上半年越南南方军民取得的辉煌胜利具有非常重要的战略意义。公报说，越南南方军民粉碎了美伪军所有规模大小不等的军事“扫荡”，使美伪军陷于更加被动的地位。美伪集团在今年上半年已经全面地向南方各地区发动了一个营以上兵力的近二千次“扫荡”，其中有二百多次出动了整个旅和师的兵力，但是它们仍然无法实现它们的战略意图，反而被越南南方军民打得焦头烂额，它们少则成百，多则成千或整个营、整个战团被歼灭。公报说，越南南方军民已经主动地在从中部到南部的所有各个战场上向敌人发动进攻，袭击敌人的各个交通线，进攻敌人据点和哨所，深入敌人的后方，歼灭了美伪军的许多有生力量，迫使它们到处被动应付。美国侵略军驻扎在哪里，哪里就出现歼美包围圈。这些包围圈日益得到发展，歼灭美军的经验日益丰富，并且吸引了广大的群众参加。仅嘉定省古芝县北河乡歼美包围圈的游击队从一月二十四日到二月二十五日就歼灭敌人二千二百一十名，其中绝大部分是美国侵略军；击毁军车十七辆，击毁击伤敌机八架。袭击机场的次数也比一九六五年增加，击毁敌机达六百架，消灭敌人三千多名。公报说，敌人的各条水陆交通运输线不断遭到袭击和破坏。
    公报说，越南南方解放武装力量的三种武装力量在战斗的过程中不断壮大和迅速成长，越来越取得进攻敌人的优势。南方军民歼灭敌人，摧毁和动摇敌人的“战略村”，缩小敌占区，扩大解放区，解放成十万人民等巨大成绩，使美伪集团极为惊慌失措。
    公报指出，六个月来的明显事实，使越南南方军民更增强了对未来胜利的信心，并且更加证明侵略者和卖国者不能逃避注定失败的命运。
