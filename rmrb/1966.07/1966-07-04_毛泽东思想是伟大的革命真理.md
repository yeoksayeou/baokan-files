	Mao Zedong Thought is a Great Revolutionary Truth
	National People's Congress Representative, Combat Hero Shū Jīchéng
	Battalion Commander of a certain unit who was awarded a collective first-class merit in the "August 6" naval battle Wáng Ruìchāng
	Boat Captain of a certain unit who was awarded a collective first-class merit in the Chongwu naval battle Tán Zūnshù
	Navigator of a certain unit who was awarded a collective first-class merit in a certain air battle Wáng Lìzhū

	In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the anti-party clique raised the black flag of "equality before truth." "Equality" plus "truth" seems grand and righteous. However, we workers, peasants, and soldiers have grasped Mao Zedong Thought, this great revolutionary truth. No matter what tricks you play, we can thoroughly expose them.

	What is truth? What is fallacy? We see it most clearly!

	Gentlemen of the bourgeoisie, you keep shouting "truth." We want to ask: Do you really understand what truth is?

	Truth is class-based. In a class society, there is only class truth, absolutely no abstract, super-class truth, absolutely no truth for the entire people. What the reactionary class regards as "truth" is fallacy to the revolutionary class; what the revolutionary class regards as truth, the reactionary class slanders as heresy. Different class standpoints mean there can be no common views or common language.

	In the old society, landlords exploited peasants. In the eyes of the landlord class, peasants renting land from landlords and paying rent to landlords was a natural "truth"; but in the eyes of the laboring people, the landlords' land was seized from the peasants, and the grain was created by the peasants' labor. The landlords were blood-sucking parasites who did not labor.

	"One does not live for oneself, but for the sake of others, heaven and earth will punish you," "It is better to live miserably than to die well," these are the "truths" of the bourgeoisie, the moral standards of all exploiting classes; while "completely, thoroughly" serving the people, living to be heavier than Mount Tai and dying to be heavier than Mount Tai, these are the worldviews of our proletarian revolutionary fighters, the moral standards of revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

	Chairman Mao teaches us that in a class society, "all kinds of thoughts are imprinted with class characteristics." Due to class interests, the reactionary and decadent bourgeoisie cannot possibly recognize truth. Only the proletariat, which represents the direction of social progress, can recognize and grasp truth. However, when you are loudly proclaiming so-called "truth," you are trying to strip truth of its class content to peddle your anti-party, anti-socialist black goods. Your calculations are wrong. Workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought cannot be deceived or intimidated by you. The more tricks you play, the more thoroughly you expose yourselves.

	The proletariat and the bourgeoisie cannot have an equal relationship

	Gentlemen of the bourgeoisie! In the old society, you madly oppressed us and cruelly exploited us. Did you ever talk about equality with us then? Now, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we have established a proletarian dictatorship, seized the guns and printing presses. Now you are talking about this "equality" and that "equality."

	Between opposing classes, there is only a dictatorship, absolutely no equality. Gentlemen of the bourgeoisie, if you have forgotten, listen to our accusations!

	Comrade Tán Zūnshù started working for a landlord's family at the age of eleven, herding cows. The cows had to be fed full, but he could only eat two bowls of thin porridge per meal. When he was extremely hungry, he had to pick "grass needles" to fill his stomach. If the cow's belly did not bulge, he would add a few more wounds to his body. The landlord would beat him while cursing that he was not as valuable as a cow.

	Comrade Shū Jīchéng's family rented land from landlords for over thirty years in the old society. Not only were the rent and taxes heavy, but countless corvee labor and unpaid labor pressed the poor people so that they could not stand up straight or breathe. One year on the last day of the lunar year, his father did not go to work for the landlord. The next day, the first day of the lunar new year, the landlord forced his father to dig a cold, bone-chilling pond all day. When he returned home, he fell seriously ill...

	Look! This is your "equality." Your "equality" is simple: drink our blood, eat our flesh, and not even spit out a bone! These things, you gentlemen may have "forgotten," but we will never forget.

	From our personal experiences, we deeply feel that for thousands of years, from the feudal emperors to Chiang Kai-shek, the laboring people have never been given any equality. Only under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao have we been liberated from a life worse than that of cattle and horses, truly becoming the masters of the state. Take us four, for example! Some, from impoverished peasants before liberation, were elected as representatives of the National People's Congress, sitting with Party and state leaders to discuss state affairs; some, from illiterate cowherds, became boat captains, patrolling day and night on the coastal frontlines, protecting the motherland; some, from ordinary students, mastered the highly complex skills of aircraft navigation, guiding our warplanes to shoot down one after another of the American and Kuomintang bandits' planes; some, from ordinary peasants, became military commanders, becoming glorious soldiers defending the motherland. All these things, who would have dared to dream of them in the old society? But in the new society, they are living realities.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: In the world, there are only cases of cats making friends with cats, not cats making friends with mice. The proletariat and the bourgeoisie cannot be friends, cannot talk about equality; revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries cannot be friends, cannot talk about equality; Marxists-Leninists and revisionists cannot be friends, cannot talk about equality. If we become friends with the enemy and talk about equality, it means we have betrayed the revolution. China will change color, the laboring people will be beheaded, and the beautiful mountains and rivers seized by revolutionary martyrs will fall back into the hands of the bourgeoisie gentlemen. The world revolution will suffer a setback, and we will commit the greatest crime against our descendants!

	Using the names of "truth" and "equality" to carry out anti-party and anti-socialist activities

	The so-called "truth" and "equality" of the bourgeoisie have long been refuted by Marxism-Leninism. Now you have picked up these rubbish again to deceive the masses. In fact, you know best that when you shout "truth" and "equality," you are only using the names of "truth" and "equality" to carry out anti-party and anti-socialist activities.

	The evidence is irrefutable. Look! When you launched a frantic attack on the Party, "breaking down the door," poisonous weeds were widely published, black words were widely spoken, bad plays were widely performed, and rightists were widely praised; but the revolutionary articles of workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works were banished to the cold palace and not published. Where did your "equality" go then? When you occupied the propaganda agencies and newspaper fronts of Beijing, you only allowed ghosts and monsters to spread poison in large quantities. The criticisms of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary leftists against the black gang were either thrown into the wastepaper basket or long detained in your "hell." Where did your "equality" go then? Under your control at Beijing University, students from exploiting class families were given all kinds of conveniences and special treatments, carefully nurtured, while students from worker and peasant families were either "advised" to drop out on the pretext of poor performance, or were "graduated early" and expelled from the school. Where did your "equality" go then?

	Your so-called "equality" is, in essence, to protect the bourgeoisie, oppose the proletariat; protect the rightists, oppose the leftists; protect revisionism, oppose Mao Zedong Thought. You attempt to replace Mao Zedong Thought with reactionary bourgeois ideology, to "peacefully transform" our proletarian dictatorship state, ultimately seize power, and turn it into a bourgeois dictatorship state. But all reactionaries always overestimate their strength and underestimate the strength of the people. In the face of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, all your schemes have already completely failed.

	Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought is our mortal enemy

	Our era is the era of the comprehensive collapse of imperialism and the victory of socialism throughout the world. In this great era, what guides us to victory is Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the great truth of the proletarian revolution.

	Truth is the reflection of objective laws. Mao Zedong Thought is the truth that conforms to the laws of socialist society development and the laws of natural development. The earth-shaking changes in New China, we have intimate feelings. We, as pilots, every time we fly in the sky of our motherland, see either a reservoir being built here or a factory being built there, we cannot help but shout from the bottom of our hearts: Long live Mao Zedong Thought! All these are not the beautiful pictures drawn by the laboring people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought? We not only built our own ten-thousand-ton ships and ten-thousand-ton hydraulic presses, but also have nuclear weapons that have been long monopolized by American imperialism and modern revisionism. Now, we drive our own planes and warships to defend the airspace and territorial waters of our motherland. Is this not the best proof of the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought?

	Mao Zedong Thought is the truth that best meets the needs of the proletarian revolution. Whether it is the Chinese revolution or the world revolution, if we act according to Mao Zedong Thought, we will achieve victory after victory. If we go against Mao Zedong Thought, we will suffer defeat. Mao Zedong Thought is the common spiritual wealth of the Chinese people and the people of the world. Chairman Mao is the embodiment of the great revolutionary truth.

	For this reason, Mao Zedong Thought has become the greatest obstacle to the anti-party clique's plot to restore the bourgeoisie. They viciously curse and fiercely attack Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao has long taught us: "In the world, there is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason." Class struggle, clear camps. This is a group of bourgeois agents who have infiltrated our Party. They know that to restore the old system and ride on the heads of the people again, they must first oppose Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, they are filled with hatred for Mao Zedong Thought and regard Chairman Mao's works as thorns in their eyes and flesh in their hearts. But we workers, peasants, and soldiers are very clear that Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Chairman Mao loves us workers and peasants the most, understands us the deepest, knows our hearts the best, and understands our wish to stand up the most. Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought is digging out our hearts. No matter how high their "position" or how great their "reputation," they are our mortal enemies who share no common fate.

	In our era, whether to support or oppose Mao Zedong Thought, to love or hate it, is the only mark to distinguish true revolutionaries from false revolutionaries, revolutionaries from counter-revolutionaries, Marxism-Leninism from revisionism. Revolutionary truth is irresistible, and the great power of Mao Zedong Thought is irresistible. All ghosts and monsters, whether they attack under the "red flag" or the "white flag," under the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will forever escape the fate of failure.

	We shout: Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

    毛泽东思想是伟大的革命真理
    全国人民代表大会代表、战斗英雄　舒积成
    “八·六”海战中荣立集体一等功的某部中队长　王瑞昌
    崇武海战中荣立集体一等功的某部艇长　谈遵树
    某次空战中荣立集体一等功的某部领航员　王立珠
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，反党黑帮们打出了“在真理面前人人平等”的黑旗。“平等”再加上“真理”，看起来似乎冠冕堂皇。可是，我们工农兵掌握了毛泽东思想这个伟大的革命真理，不管你什么骗人的把戏，我们都能彻底揭穿。
    什么是真理？什么是谬论？我们看得最清楚！
    资产阶级老爷们，你们口口声声喊什么“真理”，我们倒要问一问：你们究竟懂得什么是真理？
    真理是有阶级性的。在有阶级的社会里，只有阶级的真理，绝对没有抽象的超阶级的真理，绝对没有全民的真理。反动阶级奉为“真理”的东西，对于革命阶级来说就是谬论；革命阶级认为的真理，反动阶级就诬蔑为邪说。阶级立场不同，就不可能有共同的观点，共同的语言。
    在旧社会里，地主剥削农民，在地主阶级看来，农民租地主的地，向地主缴租，这是天经地义的“真理”；而在劳动人民看来，地主的地是从农民手里抢去的，粮食是农民劳动创造的，地主是不劳而获的吸血鬼。
    “人不为己，天诛地灭”、“好死不如赖活着”，这是资产阶级的“真理”，是一切剥削阶级的道德标准；而“毫不利己专门利人”，“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务，活要活得重于泰山，死要死得重于泰山，这是我们无产阶级革命战士的世界观，是我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命者的道德标准。
    毛主席教导我们，在阶级社会中，“各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印”。由于阶级利益的限制，反动、腐朽的资产阶级根本不可能认识真理，只有代表着社会前进方向的无产阶级，才能认识真理，掌握真理。可是，你们在大肆宣扬所谓“真理”的时候，却挖空心思地想抽掉真理的阶级内容，以便贩卖你们反党反社会主义的黑货。你们的算盘打错了，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵是你们骗不了、吓不倒的。你们越耍花招，就暴露得越彻底。
    无产阶级和资产阶级不可能有平等关系
    资产阶级老爷们！在旧社会，你们疯狂地压迫我们，残酷地剥削我们，那时，你们跟我们讲过平等吗？现在，我们在党和毛主席的英明领导下，建立了无产阶级政权，抓住了枪杆子、印把子，这时候你们却提出这个“平等”、那个“平等”来了。
    在互相对立的阶级之间，只有专政的关系，根本没有什么平等的关系。资产阶级老爷们，如果你们犯了“健忘症”的话，就听听我们对你们的控诉吧！
    谈遵树同志从十一岁起，就给地主家放牛。牛天天要吃得饱饱的，而他每顿只能吃到两碗稀麦糊，饿极了只好拔“茅针”充饥。那一天牛肚不鼓，他身上就要添几条伤痕。地主老财一面打他，一面骂他不如牛值钱。
    舒积成同志的家在旧社会租了三十多年地主的地。重租重捐还不说，数不清的差役和无偿劳动，压得穷人直不起腰，透不过气来。有一年腊月三十，他父亲没有到地主家干活，第二天大年初一，地主就逼着他父亲下到冰冷刺骨的池塘里，掏了一天塘水，回到家里就生了一场大病……。
    看！这就是你们对我们的“平等”。你们的“平等”很简单，就是喝尽我们的血，吃光我们的肉，连根骨头都不吐！这些事情你们这些老爷们可能都“忘记”了吧！可是我们永远不会忘记。
    我们从亲身经历中深深地体会到：几千年来，从封建皇帝到蒋介石，对劳动人民从来都没有给过一点什么平等。只有在党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们才从牛马不如的生活中解放出来，真正当了国家的主人。就说我们这四个人吧！有的从解放前的贫苦农民，当选为全国人民代表大会的代表，跟党和国家领导同志坐在一起讨论国家大事；有的从一字不识的放牛娃，担任了艇长，日夜巡逻在海防前线，保卫着祖国；有的从一个普通的学生，掌握了高度复杂的飞机领航的本领，引导我们的战鹰击落美蒋匪帮一架又一架的飞机；有的从一个普通的农民，当上了军事指挥员，成为保卫祖国的光荣战士。这一切一切，在旧社会谁敢想过？但是，在新社会却是活生生的现实。
    毛主席教导我们说：世界上只有猫和猫做朋友的事，没有猫和老鼠做朋友的事。无产阶级跟资产阶级决不能做什么朋友，讲什么平等；革命者跟反革命决不能做什么朋友，讲什么平等；马克思列宁主义者跟修正主义者决不能做什么朋友，讲什么平等。如果我们跟敌人做了朋友，讲了平等，那就意味着我们叛变了革命，中国就会变颜色，劳动人民就会人头落地，革命先烈夺下的美好江山，就会重新落到资产阶级老爷们的手里，世界革命就要受到挫折，我们就会对子子孙孙犯下最大的罪恶！
    借“真理”、“平等”之名，行反党反社会主义之实
    资产阶级所说的什么“真理”呀！什么“平等”呀！早已被马克思列宁主义驳得体无完肤。现在你们又把这些破烂拾了起来，欺骗群众。其实，你们自己最清楚，你们叫嚷“真理”、“平等”，不过是假“真理”、“平等”之名，行反党反社会主义之实而已。
    铁证俱在，不容抵赖。请看！当你们向党猖狂进攻，“破门而出”的时候，毒草大登特登，黑话大讲特讲，坏戏大演特演，对右派大捧特捧；对工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的革命文章呢，却打入冷宫，不予发表。这时候，你们的“平等”到那里去了呢？当你们霸占了北京市的宣传机构、报刊阵地的时候，只准牛鬼蛇神大量放毒，广大工农兵、革命左派批判黑帮的文章，不是被你们丢入纸篓，就是在你们的“阎王殿”长期扣压。这时候，你们的“平等”又到那里去了呢？在你们控制下的北京大学，对剥削阶级家庭出身的学生，百般照顾，破格安排，给予各种方便条件和特殊待遇，精心培养，而对工农家庭出身的学生，不是借口成绩不好，“劝告”退学，就是美其名曰“提前毕业”，赶出校门。这时候，你们的“平等”又到那里去了呢？
    你们所谓的“平等”，说穿了，就是保护资产阶级，反对无产阶级；保护右派，反对左派；保护修正主义，反对毛泽东思想。你们企图以反动的资产阶级思想，代替毛泽东思想，把我们无产阶级专政的国家，“和平演变”过去，最后夺取政权，变为资产阶级专政的国家。可是，一切反动派总是过高地估计自己的力量，过低地估计人民的力量。在用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵面前，你们的一切都已经彻底完蛋了。
    谁反对毛泽东思想，谁就是我们的死敌
    我们的时代，是帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。在这个伟大的时代，指导我们胜利前进的是毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是无产阶级革命的伟大真理。
    真理是客观规律的反映。毛泽东思想是符合社会主义社会发展规律的真理，是符合自然界发展规律的真理。新中国翻天覆地的变化，我们有亲切的感受。我们当飞行员的，每当飞到祖国的天空，看到不是这里修起了一个水库，就是那里又盖起了一座工厂，我们都不禁从心底里欢呼：毛泽东思想万岁！这一切，不都是在毛泽东思想指导下，劳动人民画出来的美好图画吗？我们不但自己造了万吨轮船、万吨水压机，而且有了被美帝国主义、现代修正主义长期垄断的核武器。现在，我们驾驶着自己造的飞机和军舰，保卫祖国的领空和领海。这不是最好地说明了毛泽东思想的无比威力吗？
    毛泽东思想是最符合无产阶级革命需要的真理，不论是中国革命还是世界革命，按照毛泽东思想办事，就节节胜利，违背毛泽东思想，就遭到失败。毛泽东思想是中国人民和世界人民共同的精神财富。毛主席是伟大的革命真理的化身。
    正因为这样，毛泽东思想就成了反党黑帮们实现资产阶级复辟阴谋的最大障碍。他们对毛泽东思想恶毒咒骂，疯狂攻击。毛主席早就教导过我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”阶级对垒，阵营分明。这是一伙钻进我们党内的资产阶级代理人。他们知道，要恢复旧制度，重新骑在人民的头上，首先就要反对毛泽东思想。因此，他们对毛泽东思想充满着恨，把毛主席著作看成眼中钉、肉中刺。但是，我们工农兵十分清楚，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。毛主席对我们工农兵爱得最深，了解最透，毛主席最懂得我们的心，最理解我们翻身的愿望。谁要是反对毛泽东思想，那就是挖我们的心肝，不论他“地位”多高，“声誉”多大，都是我们不共戴天的死敌。
    在我们这个时代，对毛泽东思想拥护还是反对，热爱还是敌视，这是区分真革命和假革命、革命和反革命、马克思列宁主义和修正主义的唯一标志。革命真理是不可抗拒的，毛泽东思想的伟大威力是不可抗拒的。一切牛鬼蛇神，不论是打着“红旗”进攻也好，打着白旗进攻也好，在伟大的不可战胜的毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，都永远逃脱不了失败的命运。
    我们高呼：毛泽东思想万岁！万岁！万万岁！
