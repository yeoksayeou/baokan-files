	Azania (South Africa) representative Morrison today delivered a report at the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers. In his report, he emphasized that the great victories achieved in the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation have powerfully proven the correctness of Chairman Mao Zedong's statement that "weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; it is people, not things, that are decisive." He said that no force in the world can stop the Vietnamese people from ultimately defeating U.S. imperialism.

	Morrison said that this emergency meeting of Asian and African writers is being held at a crucial moment in the global struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism, led by war-mongering America. The anti-imperialist revolutionary people of Azania, including anti-imperialist patriotic writers, are deeply concerned about the just struggles of the peoples and writers of Asia and Africa.

	Morrison said that writers from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as other progressive writers, thoroughly oppose the apologists and mouthpieces of imperialism, and those who have become captives of the reactionary bourgeois ideologies of individualism, humanitarianism, and pacifism.

	He said that Asian and African writers have a serious responsibility, especially towards the Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting against U.S. imperialist aggression. Support for the Vietnamese people is inseparable from the anti-imperialist national liberation struggles of the countries of the two continents. In addition to providing all possible direct material support, the peoples of Asia and Africa should fully launch a struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism and all their local lackeys, which is the best support for the heroic Vietnamese people.

	He said that Asian and African writers must condemn the pseudo-revolutionaries centered around the Soviet Union. They talk big and spread nets, trying to make the world's people fall into their traps, claiming that they support the struggle of the Vietnamese people. However, their actual actions are to seek "control" over the situation in Vietnam to help U.S. imperialism prolong its existence there.

	Morrison pointed out that it is more evident than ever that a broad united front against U.S. imperialism is needed. He said that such a united front should and can only include truly anti-imperialist forces. It should not and cannot include forces that are not truly anti-imperialist. It should not and cannot include those who have surrendered to imperialism, those who collude with imperialists to seize the world, the apologists of imperialism, and those who have become divisive elements in our anti-imperialist organizations and movements.

	He said that talking about "extinguishing the flames of war" is to confuse friends and enemies, to confuse the U.S. aggressors and the Vietnamese people, and to betray. Our task is not to "extinguish the flames of war," but to smash and defeat U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam, to launch a full-scale attack on imperialism led by the United States in all parts of the world, until imperialism is reduced to ashes in the flames of the people's just wars.

	Morrison condemned some so-called "friends" who are using their writers to curse people's wars. He said that these people are actually saying that the peoples of all countries should not take up arms to defend themselves, should not smash all imperialist aggression, subversion, and interference. In fact, they are against the Vietnamese people, wanting the Vietnamese people to go to the negotiating table. They oppose the people's wars currently being waged in Vietnam and other parts of the world, and talk about "united actions" and "peaceful negotiations." Their true intention in talking about "peace" is to surrender, to let imperialism and its lackeys run rampant, to invade, plunder, and pillage, and to make us lay down our arms.

	Morrison said that for revolutionary writers, there are various kinds of peace and various kinds of war. Revolutionaries want peace that is beneficial to the revolution, we support revolutionary wars, and we wage revolutionary wars with firm resolve and perseverance.

	Morrison condemned those "writers" who serve imperialism under the banner of "socialism," singing the praises of a thoroughly capitulationist literary line, especially their survivalism. He said that when these "friends" praise and peddle their "peace" themes in their works, refusing to unambiguously support the just four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the sole basis for achieving true peace, they become the thorough accomplices of U.S. imperialism. They hurl such vicious curses at the just people's war of the Vietnamese people, peddling the filthy goods of bourgeois pacifism, and are preaching such an idea: that surrender is better than struggle, that peace is above all, and that living is the highest purpose.

	He said that Asian and African writers should become tools of the Asian and African revolution, tools for expressing principled people's anti-imperialist struggles, and should use literary works as powerful weapons. The duty of all Asian and African writers and all anti-imperialist writers is to expose these accomplices of imperialism.

	Morrison quoted Chairman Mao Zedong's words: "All revolutionary writers and artists must link themselves with the masses, express the thoughts and feelings of the masses, and become the faithful spokesmen of the masses. Only then will their work have significance."

	Morrison condemned the imperialist counter-revolutionary onslaughts in Indonesia, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Palestine, and other Asian and African countries and regions. He said that wherever the imperialists, colonialists, and their lackeys launch counter-revolutionary attacks on the people, they face one counterattack after another. There is no doubt that victory is on the side of the people, and no force in the world can stop the people from advancing. No force in the world can save the imperialists from complete defeat. The peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America are firmly holding high the banner of resolute struggle, waging a tit-for-tat struggle against imperialist aggression.

	Morrison condemned the Soviet splitters for collaborating with imperialism in attacking the world's peoples. He said that the recent plot by the pseudo-revolutionaries centered around the Soviet Union to split the Asian and African writers' movement is being condemned by all Asian and African writers and peoples. These pseudo-revolutionaries are desperately trying to bring all Asian and African anti-imperialist movements under their control. The Soviet Union should take direct responsibility for the split conference in Cairo.

	Morrison said that it is time for the Asian and African peoples to expel from their ranks the culprits who have infiltrated some of our Asian and African organizations and engaged in splitist activities—the Soviet Union. They pose a great danger to our unity and solidarity. They must be kicked out, they must be driven out en masse.

	In discussing the high tide of the world's peoples' struggle against imperialist cultural aggression, Morrison said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution underway in People's China is a fatal blow to imperialism and all its schemes. This cultural revolution has made China an even stronger anti-imperialist base.

    阿扎尼亚（南非）代表摩里逊的报告
    新华社三十日讯　阿扎尼亚（南非）代表摩里逊今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上作报告。他在报告中强调指出，越南人民抗美救国斗争所取得的伟大胜利，有力地证实了毛泽东主席所说的“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物”这句名言的正确。他说，世界上没有任何力量能阻止越南人民最后战胜美帝国主义。
    摩里逊说，这次亚非作家紧急会议，是在世界范围内反对以好战的美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争面临一个重要时刻举行的。阿扎尼亚反帝的革命人民，包括反帝的爱国作家，十分关切地注视着亚非人民和作家的正义斗争。
    摩里逊说，亚非拉和其他进步作家都彻底反对帝国主义的辩护士和喉舌，反对那些今天已经成为个人主义、人道主义、和平主义这些反动的资产阶级思想的俘虏的人。
    他说，我们亚非作家的反帝力量，特别是对目前正在为反对美帝国主义侵略而进行英勇斗争的越南人民，负有严重的责任。对越南人民的声援是和我们两大洲各国的反帝民族解放斗争不可分割地联系在一起的。除了在一切可能的直接的物质支援外，亚非人民大力充分开展反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义及其一切当地走狗的斗争，就是对英雄的越南人民最好的支持。
    他说，亚非作家必须谴责以苏联为中心的伪革命者。他们侃侃而谈，大张罗网，想让世界人民上他们的圈套，认为他们是支持越南人民斗争的。而他们的实际行动，却是为了实现对越南局势的“控制”，以便帮助美帝国主义在越南苟延残喘。
    摩里逊指出，今天比任何时候都更明显，需要建立一个反对美帝国主义的广泛统一战线。他说，这样的一个统一战线只应该而且只能包括那些真正的反帝的力量。它不应该也不可能包括那些不是真正反帝的力量。它不应该也不可能包括那些已经投降帝国主义的人，那些和帝国主义者勾结起来以图霸占世界的人，那些帝国主义的辩护士，那些已成为分裂我们反帝组织和运动的人。
    他说，谈论“扑灭战火”，就是不分敌友，不分美国侵略者和越南人民，就是出卖。我们的任务不是“扑灭战火”，而是粉碎和打败美帝国主义在越南的侵略，是在世界各地充分开展对以美国为首的帝国主义的全面进攻，直到帝国主义在正义的人民战争的烈火中烧成灰烬。
    摩里逊谴责一些所谓“朋友”正在利用他们的作家咒骂人民战争。他说，这些人实际上是说，世界各国人民不应该拿起武器来保卫自己，不应该粉碎一切帝国主义的侵略、颠覆和干涉。实际上他们是反对越南人民的，是要越南人民到谈判桌上来。他们反对目前正在越南和世界其他地区进行的人民战争，而大谈什么“联合行动”和“和平谈判”。他们谈论“和平”的真正用意就是投降，就是放手让帝国主义及其走狗飞扬跋扈，进行侵略、抢劫和掠夺，就是要我们放下武器。
    摩里逊说，对我们革命作家来说，存在着各种和平和各种战争。革命者要的是对革命有利的和平，我们拥护革命战争，支持革命战争，并以坚定的决心和毅力进行革命战争。
    摩里逊谴责那些为帝国主义服务，挂着“社会主义”招牌的“作家”，歌颂那种彻头彻尾的投降主义的文艺路线，特别是他们的活命论。他说，当那些“朋友”在他们的作品中颂扬和贩卖他们的“和平”主题，拒绝毫不含糊地支持以越南民主共和国正义的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明作为争取真正和平的唯一基础的时候，他们也就成了美帝国主义的彻头彻尾的帮凶。他们对越南人民所进行的正义的人民战争抛出如此恶毒的咒骂，端出资产阶级和平主义的肮脏货色，就是宣扬这样一种思想：即投降比战斗好，和平高于一切，活着就是最高目的。
    他说，亚非作家要成为亚非革命的工具，要成为表达有原则性的人民反帝斗争的工具，要用文学作品作为强大的武器。一切亚非作家和一切反帝作家的职责，就是要揭露这些帝国主义的帮凶。
    摩里逊引用毛泽东主席说过的话：“一切革命的文学家艺术家只有联系群众，表现群众，把自己当作群众的忠实的代言人，他们的工作才有意义”。
    摩里逊谴责了帝国主义在印度尼西亚、加纳、津巴布韦、巴勒斯坦等亚非国家和地区发动了一场疯狂的反革命攻势。他说，在帝国主义者、殖民主义者及其走狗对人民发动反革命进攻的任何地方，他们都遭到一个又一个的反击。毫无疑问，胜利是在人民一边，世界上没有任何力量能够阻止人民前进。世界上没有任何力量能使帝国主义者免遭彻底的失败。非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲的人民正在坚定地高举坚决斗争的旗帜，同帝国主义的侵略进行针锋相对的斗争。
    摩里逊谴责苏联分裂主义者配合帝国主义向世界人民进攻，他说，以苏联为中心的假革命最近所策划的分裂亚非作家运动的阴谋，正在遭到所有亚非作家和人民的谴责。这些假革命者拚命地企图把所有亚非反帝运动纳入他们的轨道和置于他们的控制之下。苏联要对开罗分裂会议负直接责任。
    摩里逊说，现在是亚非人民把钻进我们一些亚非组织并制造分裂活动的祸首——苏联从自己的队伍中清除出去的时候了。他们构成了对我们的统一和团结的巨大危险。他们必须滚开，必须将他们一股脑儿撵出去。
    在谈到世界人民反对帝国主义文化侵略的高潮时，摩里逊说，正在人民中国进行的文化大革命是对帝国主义及其一切阴谋的致命打击。这场文化大革命使中国成为一个更强大的反帝根据地。
