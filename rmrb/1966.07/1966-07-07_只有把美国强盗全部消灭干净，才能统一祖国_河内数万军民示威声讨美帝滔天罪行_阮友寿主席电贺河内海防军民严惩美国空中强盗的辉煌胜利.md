Only by eliminating all American aggressors can the nation be unified

Hanoi: Tens of thousands of military personnel and civilians demonstrate to denounce the heinous crimes of American imperialism

Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho sends a telegram congratulating the military and civilians of Hanoi and Haiphong on their glorious victory in severely punishing American air aggressors

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 6th: Our correspondent reports: On the evening of the 6th, the entire city of Hanoi was in an uproar, waves of anger surged, and tens of thousands of military personnel and civilians took to the streets, holding a grand demonstration. They severely denounced the heinous crimes of American imperialism's bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, and expressed their iron will to defeat the American aggressors.

The city echoed with the resounding cries: "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Johnson!" "Eliminate the American aggressors!" "Defend the capital!"

A large group of captured American pilots, escorted by the heroic Vietnamese People's Army soldiers, marched through the streets of Hanoi amidst the surging waves of anger. They were like rats crossing the street, everyone shouting to beat them. Wherever they went, the people angrily waved their iron fists and shouted in unison: "Defeat the American aggressors!" "Severely punish the war criminals!" "American aggressors, get out of Vietnam!" "The Vietnamese people will surely win!"

The grand demonstration on the evening of the 6th also included many representatives from the suburbs of Hanoi and various parts of North Vietnam. They joined the military and civilians of Hanoi, furiously denouncing the American air pirates in public.

Heroic city, heroic people. Tonight, in the battle-ready night, they held a grand review of victory, once again demonstrating their indomitable will and strength.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 6th: In recent days, military personnel and civilians from various parts of North Vietnam have held meetings to strongly protest and denounce the heinous crimes of American air aggressors bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. The 17 million heroic military personnel and civilians roared, "Concentrate hatred on the muzzles of guns and cannons, severely punish the American aggressors!"

At the meetings, party, government, and military leaders at various levels all unanimously pointed out that American imperialism's brazen bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong does not indicate its strength but rather its weakness. The military personnel and civilians of North Vietnam are determined to fight side by side with the military personnel and civilians of the South, supporting each other, and thoroughly defeating the American aggressors.

The People's Army units have launched the "Hate the Americans" campaign, holding denunciation meetings on the front lines. The soldiers of the fourth anti-aircraft artillery battery of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit also organized a public trial of the war criminal Johnson. All the officers and soldiers are determined to turn hatred into strength, launch a campaign to kill the enemy and achieve merits, and strive to become "decisive units" and "decisive soldiers." The second company of a certain infantry unit in the Third Military Region marched eight kilometers on foot to the scene of the bombing by American air aggressors and held a protest meeting with the local people. At the meeting, an old man named Kai, whose two grandsons were recently killed by American air pirates, said: "Only by eliminating all American aggressors can our country be unified!" After the meeting, the soldiers immediately helped the local people dig transportation trenches, build fortifications, shelters, and establish combat villages.

The people of various circles in the provinces and cities of Quang Binh, Bac Thai, Ha Tinh, Phu Tho, Lang Son, Haiphong, and Nam Dinh all expressed at the meetings: No matter how far the American aggressors expand the war and how ferocious they become, they cannot intimidate the heroic Vietnamese people and cannot save American imperialism from its defeat in both North and South Vietnam.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 6th: According to the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, on June 30th, Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam National Liberation Front, sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, warmly congratulating the military and civilians of Hanoi and Haiphong and the people's air force on their glorious victory in striking the American air aggressors.

The telegram emphasized that this victory strengthened the confidence of the people in the South in the powerful North and strengthened the confidence of the Vietnamese people in the final victory of the anti-American, national salvation cause.

Nguyen Huu Tho strongly condemned in the telegram American imperialism's bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, pointing out that this is a mad new crime of "escalation" of the war. The aggressors' actions can only further arouse the hatred of all Vietnamese military personnel and civilians and the opposition of world public opinion, making them faster to their thorough and shameful defeat. This new crime of American imperialism also further exposes the hypocrisy and shamelessness of the U.S. government's plot to rehash the already bankrupt "peace talks" rhetoric.

The telegram finally expressed that the military and civilians in the South will take the military and civilians in the North and Hanoi and Haiphong as examples, fiercely fight, and continuously fight, avenge the compatriots nationwide, and defeat American imperialism and its lackeys.

    只有把美国强盗全部消灭干净，才能统一祖国
    河内数万军民示威声讨美帝滔天罪行
    阮友寿主席电贺河内海防军民严惩美国空中强盗的辉煌胜利
    据新华社河内六日电  本社记者报道：六日晚上，河内市全城沸腾，怒潮汹涌，数万军民拥上街头，举行了声势浩大的示威游行，严厉声讨美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防市的滔天罪行，并且表达他们决心战胜美国侵略强盗的钢铁意志。
    气壮山河的怒吼声响彻全城：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒约翰逊！”“消灭美国强盗！”“保卫首都！”
    一大群被活捉的美国飞行员，被雄赳赳气昂昂的英雄的越南人民军战士押解着，穿过怒潮汹涌的河内市街，游行示众。他们象老鼠过街，人人喊打，走到哪里，哪里的人民就愤怒地挥舞起钢铁般的拳头，齐声高呼：“打败美国侵略强盗！”“严惩战争罪犯！”“美国侵略者从越南滚出去！”“越南人民一定胜利！”
    参加六日晚大示威的还有从河内市郊区和越南北方各地赶来的许多群众代表。他们同河内市军民一起，怒不可遏地当众怒斥美国飞贼。
    英雄的城市，英雄的人民，今天，他们在严阵以待的战斗夜晚，进行了一场胜利的大检阅，再一次显示了自己不可战胜的意志和力量。
    据新华社河内六日电越南北方各地军民连日来纷纷举行集会，强烈抗议和愤怒声讨美国强盗飞机轰炸河内和海防的滔天罪行。一千七百万英雄军民厉声高呼“把仇恨集中到枪口上、炮口上，狠狠惩罚美国强盗！”
    参加集会的各级党政军负责人在讲话中都一致强调指出，美帝国主义悍然轰炸河内、海防，并不表明它的强大，而恰恰表明它的虚弱。越南北方军民决心同南方军民一道，互相支援，并肩战斗，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    人民军各部队都展开了“仇恨美帝”运动，在阵地上举行声讨会。高射炮某部第四高炮班的战士们还组织了审判战犯约翰逊的公审大会。全体指战员决心把仇恨化为力量开展杀敌立功竞赛，争取成为“决胜单位”和“决胜战士”。第三军区某步兵单位第二连全体指战员徒步行军八公里，赶到美国空中强盗轰炸的现场，和当地人民一起举行抗议集会。在集会上，一位有两个孙子最近被美国飞贼炸死的凯大爷说：“只有把美国强盗全部消灭干净，我们的祖国才能统一！”战士们参加集会后，立即动手帮助当地同胞挖掘交通壕、构筑工事、避弹所和建立战斗村。
    广平、北太、河西、富寿、谅山、海防、南定等省市的各界人民，在集会上都一致表示：不管美国强盗把战争扩大到哪里，凶恶到什么程度，也吓不倒英雄的越南人民，挽救不了美帝国主义在越南南北两方的惨败。
    据新华社河内六日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿，六月三十日打电报给越南祖国战线中央委员会，热烈祝贺河内、海防军民和人民空军痛击美国空中强盗的辉煌胜利。
    电报强调指出，这一胜利增强了南方军民对强大的北方的信心，增强了越南人民对抗美救国事业最后胜利的信心。
    阮友寿在电报中强烈谴责美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防的行动，指出这是一种疯狂的新的战争“升级”罪行，美国侵略者的这一行动只能更加激起全体越南军民的仇恨和世界舆论的反对，使它们更快地走向彻底和可耻的失败。美帝国主义的这一新的罪行，也进一步揭穿了美国当局阴谋重弹早已破产了的“和谈”论调的虚伪性和它的无耻的嘴脸。
    电报最后表示，南方军民将以北方军民和河内、海防军民为榜样，狠狠地打，连续地打，为全国同胞报仇，打败美帝国主义及其走狗。
