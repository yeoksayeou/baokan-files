On the battlefield of Vietnam, — an iron wall! On the battlefield of Vietnam, — a graveyard for the American aggressors! Here there are traps, there are sharp stakes; here bullets of revenge fly, there hand grenades roar and shake the sky! The flames of anti-American fury burn fiercely. The people of South Vietnam fight on and grow stronger. With iron fists, they beat the paper tiger, and the American aggressors face death everywhere! An initial summary, extraordinary: more than 60,000 American soldiers have been buried here!

On the battlefield of Vietnam, — an iron wall! On the battlefield of Vietnam, — a net spread out on the ground and in the sky! The military and the people are united, their fighting spirit is high, their hearts are united in resisting America and saving the country, and they resolutely eliminate the American wolves! What "air superiority"! The American aggressors boast loudly, but it turns out to be a tin sword, unable to withstand real steel! An initial summary, extraordinary: more than 1,200 American aircraft have been smashed to pieces on the ground!

The glorious victory is spreading far and wide, and revolutionary people everywhere are singing in joy. We are not afraid of the American aggressors jumping the wall in desperation; we will definitely annihilate all the bandits!

    英雄痛打纸老虎
    天马
    一越南战场，——铁壁铜墙！越南战场，——美国佬的坟场！这里是陷阱，那里有尖桩；这里飞来复仇的子弹，那里手雷轰隆震天响！反美怒火熊熊燃烧，南越人民越战越强，铁拳痛打纸老虎，美国佬到处面临死亡！初步总结，非比寻常：美国兵六万多名，在这儿被彻底埋葬！
    二越南战场，——铁壁铜墙；越南战场，——布下天罗地网！军民一致，斗志昂扬，抗美救国心一条，坚决消灭美国狼！什么“空中优势”，美国佬牛皮吹得怪响，却原是银样镴枪头，见不得真刀真枪！初步总结，非比寻常：一千二百多架美国飞机，粉身碎骨栽地上！
    三辉煌胜利传四方，革命人民齐欢唱。不怕美国佬狗急跳墙，定把强盗消灭光。
