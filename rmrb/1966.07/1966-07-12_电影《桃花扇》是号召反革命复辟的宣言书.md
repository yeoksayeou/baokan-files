    There is error, it must be criticized; there is poisonous weed, it must be fought against.
    - Mao Zedong

    The film "The Peony Pavilion" is a declaration for counter-revolutionary restoration.

    Editor's note: Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class, belong to a certain political line." This is the fundamental starting point for us to observe every piece of literature and art. Using Chairman Mao's teaching to analyze the film "The Peony Pavilion," we can see that it is a poisonous weed against the Party and socialism, and we can strip off the historical facade of "The Peony Pavilion," exposing its evil political purpose of advocating counter-revolutionary "integrity" and calling for counter-revolutionary restoration.

    The film "The Peony Pavilion," which is about to be released, emerged in 1962 when the class struggle was extremely sharp both domestically and internationally. Why, during the three years of difficulty, did reactionary dramas like "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "Li Huimang," "Xie Yaohuan," and reactionary films like "North of the Yangtze River," "Early Spring in February," "The Enemy at the Gate," and "The Peony Pavilion," along with a batch of reactionary art and music works, all come out? Is this situation accidental? No, it is not. The demons and monsters in the literary and artistic circles are so rampant because of their class instinct to oppose the Party and socialism, which is an immutable law of class struggle. At the same time, there is a backer supporting them. This person is the chief of the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line in the literary and artistic circles, Zhou Yang. It is precisely because of the support and protection of the black gang led by Zhou Yang that poisonous weeds can spread, and demons and monsters dare to stir up trouble.

    The black gang led by Zhou Yang has usurped the leadership of the literary and artistic circles. They use the tools of the proletarian dictatorship to carry out bourgeois dictatorship and peddle revisionist goods, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. In this current Cultural Revolution, we must not only refute and expose these poisonous weeds but also uproot their roots. To eliminate poisonous weeds like "The Peony Pavilion" and uproot the roots of poisonous weeds like "The Peony Pavilion" is a sharp class struggle. We must thoroughly smash the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang led by Zhou Yang in the literary and artistic circles. Only then can the proletariat occupy the literary and artistic front, and the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought can forever fly high on the socialist literary and artistic front.

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "Those intellectuals who harbor hostile attitudes toward our country are a very small number. These people do not like our proletarian dictatorship country; they yearn for the old society. Once they get the chance, they will stir up trouble, trying to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old China."

    The film "The Peony Pavilion" (script by Mei Qian and Sun Jing, directed by Sun Jing, produced by Xi'an Film Studio) is precisely a small group of counter-revolutionary intellectuals who, for the purpose of "overthrowing the Communist Party and restoring the old China," meticulously produced a thoroughly counter-revolutionary film.

    The literary script of this film was written in 1962. The film was completed the following year. This was a time when the class struggle was extremely sharp and intense both internationally and domestically. At that time, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries were launching a frenzied anti-China wave; the Kuomintang bandits who fled to Taiwan, with the support and encouragement of American imperialism, were attempting to take advantage of our temporary difficulties to prepare for a large-scale military adventure, invading the coastal areas of the mainland; domestically, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, along with all demons and monsters, were stirring, preparing to attack the proletarian dictatorship with knives and guns, dreaming of "changing the sky," and hoping that the Kuomintang bandits would "return to the mainland." The film "The Peony Pavilion" appeared precisely at this critical moment of class struggle.

    The play "The Peony Pavilion" has never been an ordinary love story; it is a political play. Kong Shangren's original play "The Peony Pavilion" was performed in the early Qing Dynasty, and many "old scholars" wept over it. Later, many people praised this play, also from a political perspective. The film "The Peony Pavilion" appeared with a changed appearance, also for political purposes. The director repeatedly emphasized: "The Peony Pavilion" is using the theme of love to express the feeling of rise and fall." This sentence is very clear: in this play, the author's political intentions and purposes are deeply embedded.

    As long as we put the film in the context of the overall class struggle at that time, it is not difficult to see: the "feeling of rise and fall" that the author expresses here is nothing but an endless lament for the collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek regime and a strong longing for the restoration of the Chiang Kai-shek regime. The film vigorously advocates the counter-revolutionary "integrity" of dying for the overthrown old regime, maliciously curses the Communist Party and the proletarian dictatorship, and eagerly sings the praises of the "Donglin spirit" that is opposed to the socialist system to the end. It directly calls for counter-revolutionary rebellion. It is through these aspects that it serves the restoration of the Chiang Kai-shek regime.

    Advocating the counter-revolutionary "integrity" of dying for the overthrown old regime

    During a discussion with the actors about the script, the director clearly pointed out: "Our theme is to sing the praises of patriotic and upright people." He also said: the theme of the film is "life is precious, but love is even more precious, if for the sake of integrity, both can be abandoned." "Integrity is the theme throughout the film."

    To highlight this theme, the author carefully chose two lines of poetry as the theme of the entire film: "In life, be a hero; in death, be a ghost hero." These two lines of poetry appear three times in the film, in the mouths of the protagonists Hou Zong and Li Xiangjun: the first time, in the morning after Hou and Li's love confession, this is the political foundation of their union; the second time, at the moment of Hou and Li's separation, this is their political oath; the third time, at the end of the entire play, it is Li Xiangjun using it to "condemn" Hou Zong for breaking his oath, indicating that she will adhere to this oath to the end of her life. All of these are additions made by the author during the adaptation. It is the crystallization of the director's thoughts, the most representative of the author's intentions.

    What kind of "hero" do they want to be? For what kind of "ghost hero"?

    Li Xiangjun has a straightforward answer to this question. After the Ming Dynasty was overthrown, she shouted loudly: "I, Li Xiangjun, was born a person of the Great Ming Dynasty and will die a ghost of the Great Ming Dynasty." In a nutshell, what they want to be is a "hero" and "ghost hero" who are loyal to the overthrown old regime to the death.

    In the three hundred years since the fall of the Ming Dynasty, why do the film directors spend so much effort to sing the praises and advocate the spirit of being loyal to the old regime to the death?

    Is it to advocate national integrity?

    No! If the purpose of the film is to advocate national integrity, why is there not even a shadow of the description of national invasion in the film? We do not see a single Qing soldier in the film, nor do we see a single people's group resisting national invasion. The only "hero" that appears is Shi Kefa, who has the blood of the peasant uprising on his hands and is always eager to cooperate with the Qing soldiers to suppress the peasant uprising. The film's description of Shi Kefa does not focus on resisting the Qing but on advocating the feudal "loyalty to the emperor" ideology of "dying for the country is the duty of a subject." What he said, "to leave a righteous spirit for the world," is nothing but this reactionary "integrity" of being loyal to the overthrown old regime!

    Is it to advocate patriotism?

    This raises a question: what "country" does the author want people to love?

    Everyone knows that the Ming Dynasty was an extremely reactionary feudal regime under the dictatorship of the landlord class. It was overthrown in the revolutionary storm of the nationwide peasant uprising. Hou Zong is a landlord who fled from Henan to Nanjing to avoid the blows of Li Zicheng's peasant uprising, living in extreme decadence, and exuding the stench of the exploiting class. He harbors deep hatred for the peasant uprising that overthrew the Ming Dynasty. In the film script, there is such a dialogue: Yang Longyou asked: "Brother Zong, how is the situation in Henan this time?" Hou Zong sighed and replied: "It's unbearable! The countryside is in ruins, and the people are suffering. Li Zicheng has swept half the sky. It is said that the Qing soldiers outside the Great Wall are eyeing the opportunity to invade. The situation of the country is truly unbearable." "Alas! The Great Ming Dynasty is truly in a state of turmoil!" Note that Hou Zong's description of "the countryside is in ruins, and the people are suffering" refers to the situation in Henan under the control of Li Zicheng's peasant army. This is not a condemnation of the Ming Dynasty but a curse on the peasant uprising army. He said, "the situation of the country is truly unbearable," mainly referring to the fact that the Ming Dynasty was on the verge of collapse under the blows of the peasant uprising. As for the "Qing soldiers outside the Great Wall," they are only "eyeing the opportunity to invade." Later, the director, feeling guilty, deleted the sentence "Li Zicheng has swept half the sky" that openly attacks the peasant uprising army in the film, but everything else remains the same, not changing the original meaning of this dialogue at all. The matter is clear: the "country" that Hou Zong loves is none other than the "country" of the landlord class facing the fate of annihilation in the peasant uprising; the "integrity" that they advocate is precisely the counter-revolutionary "integrity" of being loyal to this reactionary regime to the death.

    Li Xiangjun's identity in the film is a prostitute, but in reality, she is a completely politicized figure. Hou Zong sighed on the corridor of the Qinhuai River: "The singing girl does not know the sorrow of the country's fall," immediately receiving the resonance from the painted boat of Li Xiangjun: "Those who do not know the sorrow of the country's fall are not just the singing girls!" Later, the author repeatedly shows her unshakable loyalty to the "Great Ming Dynasty" and her unyielding stance against the "traitorous party." For this person, we must not understand her according to the identity that the director gives her on the surface. Otherwise, we will be deceived. She actually embodies the feelings, wishes, and will of the old ruling class and the exploiting class. The author, with extreme reverence, deliberately creates and portrays such a character. This common love and loyalty to the Ming Dynasty, and hatred and enmity towards the peasant uprising army, is precisely the political foundation of the union between Hou Zong and Li Xiangjun.

    This counter-revolutionary fugitive landlord, Hou Zong, fled from Henan to Nanjing, which was still under the rule of the "Chongzhen Emperor," and found his "heaven" again. How does the film depict Nanjing at the end of the Chongzhen era? The author describes it with a heart full of longing. In the storyboard, it is noted: at the beginning of the film, it should show "a scene of prosperity with lively music and bustling activity." It is also noted: pushing open the window from the Mi Xiang Lou, one sees "the Qinhuai River in the spring under the morning sun." The initial scenes in the brothel are also unfolded in a joyful and lively rhythm. The director repeatedly emphasizes these scenes: "The description of this scene is cheerful, joyful, and relaxed," "this scene is the joyful climax of the entire play." The brothel, which is originally the darkest, most decadent, and dirtiest place in the old society, is presented to the audience as so tranquil, elegant, and full of poetry and painting. This is not a brothel at all; it is clearly a "paradise" of endless joy. The Ming Dynasty, in the eyes of the broad masses of peasants, is a hell on earth stained with blood under the dictatorship of the landlord class; but in the eyes of the film directors, it is a heaven on earth where one can indulge in pleasure. Here, the film directors deliberately beautify the prosperous and peaceful scenery of Qinhuai, which, in essence, is to make a small group of "old scholars" and counter-revolutionaries who still yearn for the Chiang Kai-shek regime that was overthrown more than ten years ago by the people, have a sense of nostalgia, express their "feeling of rise and fall," reminisce about the lost "heaven," and rekindle their loyalty to the restoration of the Chiang Kai-shek regime.

    The film directors' intentions for this film can be said to be heart-wrenching. In the film script, there were originally two scenes where the "Chongzhen Emperor," who committed suicide in the peasant revolutionary storm, appeared with his spirit tablet. The author later worried that in 1962, bringing out the spirit tablet of the "Chongzhen Emperor" again and again, it was too similar to some landlords and rich peasants who brought out their hidden "change the sky" accounts to encourage revenge, making their counter-revolutionary tail too obvious, too contrary to the covert and circuitous counter-revolutionary tactics. The director had to change these two scenes. However, the more they cover it up, the more it reveals. Their evidence of using the film "The Peony Pavilion" to directly incite counter-revolutionary restoration cannot be covered up.

    Now, we can see very clearly: the "integrity" that the directors are so enthusiastic about singing the praises of is what kind of thing. The cry of "where is the country, where is the home?" in the film script after the fall of the Ming Dynasty is precisely the voice of all counter-revolutionaries after the fall of the Chiang Kai-shek regime. Li Xiangjun's loud shout in the film, "born a person of the Great Ming Dynasty, die a ghost of the Great Ming Dynasty!" restored to its original meaning, is precisely the "born a person of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, die a ghost of the Chiang Kai-shek regime!" in the hearts of the directors. When the Kuomintang bandits were crazily shouting "counterattack the mainland," dreaming of counter-revolutionary restoration, the directors shouted so loudly to advocate this spirit of being loyal to the overthrown Ming Dynasty to the death, precisely calling on all counter-revolutionaries to be loyal to the Chiang Kai-shek regime to the death, preparing to be loyal to the Kuomintang bandits' "anti-communist restoration." Is this not clear enough? Indirectly hinting, maliciously cursing the Communist Party and the proletarian dictatorship

    After the peasant uprising army of Li Zicheng occupied Beijing and the "Chongzhen Emperor" hanged himself, the landlord class immediately enthroned the "Prince of Fu" in Nanjing, with Ma Shiying and others in power, continuing to fight against the peasant uprising army. This regime is known as the "Southern Ming" in history.

    The author of the film "The Peony Pavilion" used a long sequence of shots, expending all their effort, to curse the same "Great Ming Dynasty" of the "Southern Ming." The author extremely hated this new regime and tried to "expose the tyranny of Ma and Yuan," to "show the disaster of the Ma and Yuan ruling class to the people through the destruction of Hou and Li's happiness." He used completely opposite colors and tones to describe Nanjing before and after Ma and Yuan took power. In the film, there are two scenes where Hou Zong enters the Mi Xiang Lou and pushes open the window to overlook the Qinhuai River: the first time is at the end of the Chongzhen era, when the sun was shining brightly, and everything was full of vitality; the second time is after Ma and Yuan took power, the scene suddenly became filled with smoke and desolation, forming a very strong contrast.

    Since the "Chongzhen Emperor" and the "Prince of Fu" both belong to the Ming Dynasty, why does the author sometimes describe them as a "happy" heaven and sometimes curse them as a dark hell? If it is said that it is because the Southern Ming has the "tyranny of Ma and Yuan," then during the Chongzhen era, was it not also a naked landlord class tyranny? Wasn't the corruption of the "court" at that time well-known to all? The author's contradictions are so obvious that they cannot be self-explanatory, and there is another intention. According to the logic of the film itself, after the Chongzhen's death, the target of its attack should naturally be the peasant uprising army that overthrew this landlord class regime. However, the film directors know that doing so would expose themselves too clearly. Therefore, they had to adopt this more circuitous method, using the "Southern Ming" as a pretext to make a big deal out of it.

    In the director's explanation, with a piercing tone, it is emphasized: "After the Prince of Fu ascended the throne and Ma and Yuan took power, 'this scene mainly describes the atmosphere of the times.'"

    What a "atmosphere of the times"! In one sentence, the film directors' ulterior motives are exposed, and their secrets are revealed. They want to use the "Southern Ming" to shadow the new China after liberation, using the most vicious language to curse the proletarian dictatorship, curse the Communist Party, and curse socialism. A bundle of arrows of hatred towards the new society is thus shamelessly shot out!

    Look, what kind of "atmosphere of the times" does the author want to describe?

    It is an era of tyranny and darkness. The rulers at that time indulged in plunder and debauchery, completely destroying all freedom of speech and assembly, and ruthlessly persecuting all "commentators on state affairs" intellectuals, determined to "eradicate them root and branch." On the screen, we can see groups of intellectuals who are dissatisfied with the status quo being taken away in shackles; places where intellectuals gather to discuss are sealed off with seals; "outside, people are being arrested everywhere"; the happy marriage of Hou and Li is forcibly torn apart, and their happy life becomes a bubble.

    It is also an era of widespread suffering and misery. In the film script, we can read such words: "Ten out of ten houses are empty on the roadside, villages are desolate, and the main roads are filled with homeless refugees, with dirty faces, rolling in the ditches." "Groups of refugees, walking with heavy steps. The setting sun casts their long shadows on the barren ridges."

    Enough, enough! Those with discerning eyes can understand: why does the film director want to loudly condemn the so-called tyranny of the Southern Ming in 1962 and 1963? Who, in the brilliant socialist new China, harbors such a cold and icy heart? Who, in the new China where the laboring people are the masters, feels persecuted everywhere, has no freedom, laments the collapse of their happiness? Who, when the Chinese people are high-spirited and overcoming all difficulties with the three red banners, feels desolate and barren everywhere? It is not someone else, but a small group of exploiting class elements who have lost their original "heaven," a small group of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have been overthrown by the people. The film "The Peony Pavilion" so prominently describes these things at that time, only to take the opportunity to reflect the voice of this small group of demons and monsters!

    The film directors, unable to suppress their deep hatred for the Party and socialism, in the "forced marriage" scene, let Li Xiangjun curse through her mouth:

    "You bunch of servants, don't push it too far!" "Even if the power of the prime minister is great, it is not greater than a life!"

    At this time, the sky is filled with dark clouds, and a cold wind blows, making the moon dim. The off-screen singing voice is: "The whole building is covered with frost and moonlight, and the hatred does not disappear at dawn." The author fully expresses his "hatred" here. In their eyes, the surroundings are endless night, pitch black, but they will not "surrender," waiting for "dawn." Even then, their "hatred" will not disappear. They are preparing for a class revenge.

    Following this, the author carefully designed the "banquet of curses" scene, "thoroughly and satisfyingly" expressing their counter-revolutionary spirit of "cursing," saying that it is to "curse the traitorous party in public," making "the audience worry about Xiangjun's fate, but also feel greatly satisfied," forming the climax of the entire play. Isn't this the same tune as Wu Han's repeated emphasis on wanting to "curse very satisfyingly," "curse a bit on the stage, feel satisfied," and so on?

    However, even such "cursing," the playwright still fears that people might not understand, still feels unsatisfied, and still cannot dispel the long-accumulated hatred in their hearts. Therefore, after cursing a round, they added through Li Xiangjun's mouth, with heavier tones, singing: "Cursing loudly, see if you understand," and immediately arranged a scene where Yang Longyou visits Li Xiangjun, letting Li Xiangjun say such extremely poisonous words: "Born with such a temper, seeing those traitors, I can't help but want to tear off a piece of their skin!" They feel: only by cursing like this can they vent that extreme counter-revolutionary class hatred towards the Communist Party, and only by doing so can they arouse the strong resonance of all demons and monsters, inspiring them to rise up together and engage in counter-revolutionary restoration activities.

    "Hate" and "curse," this is precisely the common voice of all landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and all demons and monsters at that time. They truly hate the Communist Party and the new China with "unquenchable hatred," and they are indeed harboring deep hatred. "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is cursing, "Li Huimang" is cursing, "Xie Yaohuan" is cursing, and all class enemies at home and abroad are cursing with gritted teeth. This spirit of counter-revolutionary diehards who are enemies of the Chinese people to the end is also an important content of the counter-revolutionary "integrity" advocated by the film "The Peony Pavilion."

    Fervently singing the praises of the "Donglin spirit," advocating counter-revolutionary rebellion

    To vigorously advocate this counter-revolutionary "integrity," the film directors summarize it, concretize it, and raise a banner called the "Donglin spirit."

    Everyone knows that in history, Donglin and Fuxiang were opposition parties of the landlord class. The Donglin Party, at that time, precisely with "integrity" as their banner, claiming to "not follow the crowd," constantly "evaluating people and criticizing the court," once in the feudal literati, many "followed the righteous criticism to Donglin." Fuxiang rose after Donglin, known as the "little Donglin." These were originally just manifestations of contradictions between some big dogs, small dogs, fat dogs, and hungry dogs within the landlord class, occupying no important position in history, and today are not worth a glance at the corpses!

    Yet, it is precisely this insignificant corpse that was suddenly favored by the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang in recent years. Deng Tuo enthusiastically praised the "political aspirations of the Donglin Party people," praising them for "firmly resisting the evil ministers and unyielding," calling them "a group of good men of the Donglin era." Zhou Yisheng emphasized "the Donglin Party people are not to be bullied." Li Pingxin was a staunch supporter of Donglin. Mei Qian and Sun Jing also praised the Donglin and Fuxiang spirit to the skies in "The Peony Pavilion"!

    At the beginning of the film, we can see: a group of Fuxiang literati gather together, boasting to each other: "We scholars first value integrity." Li Xiangjun loves Hou Zong, not for any other reason, but because "Mr. Hou is a famous scholar of the day, a pure stream of Fuxiang." Su Kunsheng immediately adds: "Haven't you heard that every household's husband is Donglin?" In the "banquet of curses" scene, it is even sung through Li Xiangjun's mouth, word by word: "Donglin brothers, we in the green house all respect them." In fact, the image of Li Xiangjun in the film is itself a tool used by the author to represent the "Donglin spirit." She is a big poisonous snake disguised in a peony skin. We must strike her down!

    The corpse of Donglin and Fuxiang from three hundred years ago, in the 1960s of the 20th century, aroused such great interest from this group of counter-revolutionary black gang, this is naturally not out of some historical interest, but to adapt to their realistic needs for counter-revolutionary restoration.

    They are so eager to promote Donglin and Fuxiang, only to advocate the spirit of "opposition" that it represents!

    They are so eager to promote Donglin and Fuxiang, only to use the banner of "Donglin" to advocate their counter-revolutionary "integrity" of being loyal to Chiang Kai-shek and being enemies of the new China to the end.

    They are so eager to promote Donglin and Fuxiang, and through the mouth of the Fuxiang literati, say: "You say the state affairs are unbearable, but if we don't ask, who will?" It is precisely to use the "Donglin spirit" to inspire all counter-revolutionary intellectuals to take the lead in the restoration of the Chiang Kai-shek regime. In their eyes, today, this group of counter-revolutionary intellectuals still have the capital to compete with socialism. They need this group of intellectuals to mobilize public opinion and prepare for counter-revolutionary restoration. Advocating the so-called "Donglin spirit" is precisely to give these counter-revolutionary intellectuals and all demons and monsters spiritual encouragement and support, to fight against the Communist Party to the end!

    The author also tries to gather all possible intellectuals who can be used by them under their counter-revolutionary banner. The Hou Zong in the film, although he wears a long braid to "Baocheng Observatory" after surrendering to the Qing, is severely rebuked by Li Xiangjun. However, from the entire film, the surrendered and betrayed Hou Zong is extremely beautified and praised. His escape from Yangzhou in danger is said to be "a scholar's death is useless." His taking the imperial examination is also because "the country has changed hands, and the state is in ruins," a temporary expedient. The "Baocheng Observatory" scene is completely added on. Even in this scene, Hou Zong still maintains a "gentleman's" demeanor, showing his inner pain. This is the author's expression of loyalty to their master, indicating that they are working in the new China today, but their hearts are with the Han. The author, for those who, in their eyes, have some lack of "Donglin spirit" and are already working for the new society, both criticizes and expects, urging them not to follow the Communist Party, to turn back, and join them in rebellion. The Yang Longyou in the film is also a character carefully carved by the author with deep meaning. According to the director's explanation, this is a "non-offensive" "good man," but the result is "suffering on all sides," and finally takes the path of breaking with Ma and Yuan. They precisely want to use this character to call on those intellectuals who, in their eyes, are in an "intermediate state," not to have illusions about the Communist Party, not to fear "offending" the Communist Party, but to rise up and fight against the Communist Party!

    "Do not say that scholars are empty talkers, their heads are thrown where the blood is red." Deng Tuo's two lines of poetry praising the Donglin Party reveal the mystery. They do this, not for "empty talkers." "Zhuang Jian dances with a sword, intending to stab Pei." Their purpose is all for seizing power. They are already prepared to "throw their heads where the blood is red," ready to fight to the death with the Communist Party. They attempt to achieve counter-revolutionary restoration, pulling China back into the abyss of semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, and throwing the laboring people back into a sea of blood!

    Listen to the off-screen singing at the end of the film: "The deep love of the young couple is erased in one stroke, under the peony fan, sending off the Southern Dynasty, tearing apart, tearing apart, one by one, and again, the blood is red on the peony fan, the peony is red!" When the singing reaches "again, the blood is red on the peony fan," the film's camera immediately turns to a blooming red peony, and the entire play ends with the singing. They are openly calling on all counter-revolutionaries to rise up, engage in counter-revolutionary rebellion, and "again, the blood is red on the peony fan" to attack the revolutionary people with knives and guns, overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system, restore their lost "heaven," and realize their long-cherished dream of counter-revolutionary restoration.

    On the screen, we can already see the flashing sword lights and the strong smell of blood!

    It is worth noting that: Mei Qian and Sun Jing are originally extremely filthy people in history. Sun Jing was a right-winger in the film industry in the 1930s and collaborated with the enemy during the War of Resistance. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he sold himself to the Kuomintang and made reactionary films that sang the praises of Kuomintang spies. After liberation, he was consistently reactionary. Mei Qian is no different. In those years, the Chinese people suffered some temporary difficulties, and the class enemies at home and abroad were once rampant. The Kuomintang bandits were actively preparing to invade the mainland, and imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries were frantically anti-China. Under such a situation, the Zhou Yang black gang also convened meetings and held study classes in the film industry, stirring up trouble. Zhou Yang shouted at the national feature film creation conference, "We must cultivate the spirit of Hai Rui's memorial," requiring writers to "take the world as their responsibility," have their own ideals and standards, and strive to discover "people with will and action." Mei Qian and Sun Jing were greatly inspired. They thought the time had come, thinking that the Communist Party's rule was in a state of "turmoil," and hurriedly wrote the script in Beijing, eagerly joining the battle, shouting "the collapse of tyranny," and throwing out their declaration for counter-revolutionary restoration, hoping that China would change color.

    But they were blind! The iron mountain of the Chinese laboring people is unshakable. How can a few ants shake this towering tree! The development of objective things is always contrary to the subjective wishes of this group of counter-revolutionaries. What they did not only did not gain any benefits but instead completely exposed their extremely ugly reactionary faces.

    Now, a great wave of the proletarian cultural revolution has risen across the country. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have risen up to fight, sweeping away all demons and monsters. This is the roaring waves of the sea, this is the storm of the times! Wherever the blade points, demons and monsters reveal their true colors, have nowhere to hide, and will be buried in this revolutionary torrent!

    有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争。

　　电影《桃花扇》是号召反革命复辟的宣言书
　　东锋
    编者按：毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”这是我们观察每一件文学艺术作品的根本出发点。用毛主席的这个教导分析电影《桃花扇》，就能看出这是一株反党反社会主义的大毒草，就能剥开《桃花扇》所谓历史题材的画皮，暴露出它宣扬反革命“气节”，号召反革命复辟的罪恶的政治目的。
    即将放映的电影《桃花扇》，是在一九六二年国内外阶级斗争十分尖锐的形势下出笼的。为什么在三年困难时期，象《海瑞罢官》、《李慧娘》、《谢瑶环》等反动戏剧，《北国江南》、《早春二月》、《兵临城下》、《桃花扇》等反动电影，以及一批反动的美术、音乐等作品，都抛头露面了呢？这种情况是偶然的吗？不是的。文艺界的牛鬼蛇神如此嚣张，出于他们反党反社会主义的阶级本能，这是不以人们意志为转移的阶级斗争规律。同时因为有一个后台老板支持他们。此人就是文艺界反党反社会主义黑线的主帅周扬。正是由于以周扬为首的一伙黑帮的支持和庇护，毒草才能泛滥，牛鬼蛇神才敢兴风作浪。
    周扬这伙黑帮，篡夺了文艺界的领导权。他们利用无产阶级专政的工具，大搞资产阶级专政，大贩修正主义货色，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。在当前这场文化大革命中，不仅要把这些毒草驳倒、斗臭，而且要把它们的老根挖出来。铲除《桃花扇》之类的毒草，挖出《桃花扇》之类毒草的老根，是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。我们必须把文艺界反党反社会主义的以周扬为首的黑帮彻底打垮。这样，无产阶级才能占领文艺阵地，毛泽东思想的伟大红旗才能在社会主义文艺阵地上永远飘扬。
    毛主席教导我们：“对于我们的国家抱着敌对情绪的知识分子，是极少数。这种人不喜欢我们这个无产阶级专政的国家，他们留恋旧社会。一遇机会，他们就会兴风作浪，想要推翻共产党，恢复旧中国。”
    电影《桃花扇》（梅阡、孙敬编剧，孙敬导演，西安电影制片厂出品），正是这样一小撮反革命的知识分子为着“推翻共产党，恢复旧中国”而精心制作的一部彻头彻尾反革命的影片。
    这部影片的文学剧本写于一九六二年。影片于次年拍摄完成。这正是国际国内阶级斗争十分尖锐、十分激烈的年代。那时候，帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派正在掀起疯狂的反华浪潮；逃往台湾的蒋介石匪帮，正在美帝国主义的支持和鼓励下，妄图利用我们某些暂时的困难，准备进行大规模的军事冒险，窜犯大陆的沿海地区；国内的地富反坏右和一切牛鬼蛇神蠢蠢欲动，准备对无产阶级专政动刀动枪，大做其“变天”梦，妄想蒋介石匪帮“重返大陆”。电影《桃花扇》正是在阶级斗争这样一个严重时刻出现的。
    《桃花扇》这部戏，从来不是一部普通的爱情戏，而是一部政治戏。孔尚任作的《桃花扇》传奇本在清初演出时，许多“遗老遗少”为之“欷歔不已”。后来许多人吹捧这个戏，也是从政治上着眼的。电影《桃花扇》改头换面地出现，也是出于政治上的目的。影片编导一再强调：“《桃花扇》是借离合之情，抒兴亡之感。”这句话点得很明白：在这部戏里，是深深地寄托着作者的政治意图和政治目的的。
    只要把影片放到当时阶级斗争的全局中来考察，不难看出：作者在这里所抒的“兴亡之感”，不是别的，正是对蒋家王朝覆灭的无限哀叹，对蒋家王朝复辟的强烈期待。影片大肆宣扬至死效忠于被推翻的旧王朝的反革命“气节”，恶毒咒骂共产党和无产阶级专政，竭力歌颂同社会主义制度为敌到底的“东林精神”，直接号召反革命暴乱。它正是通过这些方面来为蒋家王朝的复辟服务的。
    宣扬至死效忠于被推翻的旧王朝的反革命“气节”
    影片导演在同演员谈剧本时，明白指出：“我们的主题是歌颂爱国的、有气节的人。”他又说：影片的主题是“生命诚可贵，爱情价更高，若为气节故，两者皆可抛。”“气节是贯穿全片的。”
    为了突出这一主题，作者精心选择了两句诗作为贯穿全片的主题诗：“生当作人杰，死亦为鬼雄。”这两句诗，在片中主人公侯朝宗、李香君的口中反复出现了三次：第一次，在侯、李定情的次晨，这是两人结合的政治基础；第二次，在侯、李分手的时刻，这是两人相约的政治盟誓；第三次，在全剧的最终，是李香君用来“谴责”侯朝宗背弃誓约，表示自己要至死奉行这个誓约。这些，都是作者在改编时特意添加的。它是影片编导思想的结晶，是最能代表作者制作意图的精心之笔。
    他们所要作的是什么“人杰”？为的是什么“鬼雄”？
    对这个问题，李香君有一个直截了当的回答。她在明朝被推翻以后，大声疾呼地说：“我李香君生为大明朝的人，死作大明朝的鬼。”一句话，他们所要做的，就是至死效忠于被推翻的旧王朝的“人杰”和“鬼雄”。
    在朱明王朝已经被推翻了三百多年后的今天，为什么电影编导要花这么大的力量，歌颂和宣扬他们这种至死效忠于旧王朝的精神呢？
    是为了宣扬民族气节吗？
    不！如果影片的目的是要宣扬民族气节，为什么在片子里对当时民族侵略的描写连一点影子都没有？我们在影片中看不到一个清兵，看不到一个反抗民族侵略的人民群众。唯一出现的一个“英雄”，是双手沾满农民起义军鲜血、念念不忘要和清兵合作来镇压农民起义军的史可法。而影片对史可法的描写，着力点也不在于抗清，而在于宣扬“以死报国，原是作臣子的本分”那种封建“忠君”思想。他所说的“要为天地之间留下一股正气”，无非还是这种至死效忠于旧王朝的反动“气节”罢了！
    是为了宣扬爱国思想吗？
    这就提出了一个问题：作者要人们去爱的是什么
  “国”？谁都知道，朱明王朝是一个极端反动的地主阶级专政下的封建王朝。它是在全国农民大起义的革命风暴中被推翻的。侯朝宗是一个为逃避李自成农民起义军的打击而从河南逃到南京、生活极端糜烂、浑身散发着剥削阶级臭气的逃亡地主。他对农民起义军起来推翻明王朝怀着刻骨的仇恨。在电影文学剧本中有着这样一段对话：杨龙友问道：“朝宗兄这次从河南来，那里的情形怎么样？”侯朝宗感慨地回答：“不能提了！哀鸿遍野，民不聊生，李闯席卷了半边天。听说关外清兵正虎视眈眈，想乘虚而入。国事真不堪问了。”“唉！大明朝的天下，真是风雨飘摇了！”请注意，侯朝宗所说的“哀鸿遍野，民不聊生”，是指当时在李自成农民军控制下的河南的情景。这不是对朱明王朝的谴责，而是对农民起义军的咒骂。他所说的“国事真不堪问”，主要是指明王朝在农民起义的打击下已经摇摇欲坠，至于“关外清兵”，不过是“想乘虚而入”而已。后来，编导者做贼心虚，在影片中把“李闯席卷了半边天”这句露骨攻击农民起义军的话删去，但其他仍然一切照旧，丝毫也没有改变这段对话的原意。事情很明白：侯朝宗所爱的“国”，不是别的，正是在农民大起义烽火中面临灭亡命运的地主阶级的“国”；他们所标榜的“气节”，正是至死效忠于这个反动王朝的反革命“气节”。
    李香君在影片中的身份是妓女，但她实际上却是个完全政治化的人物。侯朝宗在秦淮河的游廊上发出这样的感叹：“商女不知亡国恨”，立刻就得到了画舫上李香君的共鸣：“不知亡国恨的，岂止是商女！”以后，作者更处处表现她对“大明朝”的忠贞不移以及她对“奸党”的誓不两立。对这个人，我们决不能按照影片编导者表面上给予她的那个身份去理解。那样，我们就上当了。她实际上正集中地体现了旧的统治阶级和剥削阶级的感情、愿望和意志。作者怀着极度崇敬的心情着意塑造和刻划的就是这样的性格。而这种共同的对朱明王朝的爱和忠，对农民起义军的仇和恨，正是侯朝宗和李香君结合的政治基础。
    这个反革命的逃亡地主侯朝宗，从河南逃到了当时还在“崇祯皇帝”统治下的南京，重新找到了他的“天堂”。影片是怎样来描绘“崇祯”末年的南京的呢？作者是怀着无限眷恋的心情来描写它的。在分镜头剧本上注明：电影一开始，要表现出“急管繁弦，一片升平景象。”又注明：从媚香楼推开窗户，看到的是“朝阳映照下的春天的秦淮河”。妓院的最初几场戏，更是在欢乐、轻快的节奏中展开的。影片编导对这几场戏一再强调：“这场戏的描绘是调子愉快的、欢乐的、轻松的”，“这场戏是全剧欢乐的高潮。”妓院，这本来是旧社会中最黑暗、最腐朽、最肮脏的地方，但影片展现在人们面前的，却是那样地恬静清雅、富有诗情画意。这哪里是什么妓院？分明是一个无限欢乐的“安乐窝”。朱明王朝，在广大农民看来，是一座地主阶级专政下的血迹斑斑的人间地狱；而在影片编导看来，却是可以恣意享乐的人间天堂。这里，电影编导着意美化的歌舞升平的秦淮景色，说穿了，就是要一小撮至今念念不忘十多年前被人民推翻的蒋家小朝廷的“遗老遗少”和反革命分子，来一个触景生情，抒一番“兴亡之感”，追怀一下已经失去的“天堂”，再燃起他们对恢复蒋家王朝的忠心而已。
    电影编导对这部片子的用心，可说是呕心沥血的。在电影文学剧本中，原来曾两次出现过那个在农民革命风暴中被迫自杀的地主阶级总头子“崇祯皇帝”的牌位。作者后来担心，在一九六二年，这样一而再地把“崇祯皇帝”的灵牌捧出来，搞得跟当时一些地富分子把自己收藏的变天账捧出来鼓励复仇，未免太相象了，容易把自己的反革命尾巴露得太明显，太违背了隐晦曲折的反革命手法，编导者不得不把这两个镜头改掉。可是欲盖弥彰，他们利用电影《桃花扇》进行直接的反革命复辟鼓动的罪证，是怎么也掩盖不了的。
    现在，我们已经可以十分清楚地看到：编导者如此热情地歌颂的“气节”，究竟是种什么样的东西。电影文学剧本中李香君在朱家王朝覆灭后所发出的“国在哪里，家在哪里？”的惨叫，正是喊出了蒋家王朝覆灭后一切反革命分子的心声。李香君在影片中大声疾呼地喊出的“生为大明朝的人，死作大明朝的鬼！”还它的本来面目，就是编导者心中的“生为蒋家王朝的人，死作蒋家王朝的鬼！”当蒋介石匪帮疯狂叫嚣“反攻大陆”，梦想反革命复辟的时候，编导者如此声嘶力竭地宣扬这种至死效忠于被推翻的朱明王朝的精神，就是号召一切反革命分子至死效忠于蒋家王朝，准备为蒋介石匪帮的“反共复国”效忠。这不是再明白也没有了吗？含沙射影，恶毒咒骂共产党和无产阶级专政
    在李自成的农民起义军占领北京、“崇祯”吊死以后，地主阶级立刻在南京拥立“福王”，由马士英等当政，继续与农民起义军为敌。这个政权，在历史上被称作“南明”。
    电影《桃花扇》的作者，使用了很长的画面，费尽了吃奶的力气，痛骂同样是一个“大明朝”的“南明”。作者极端痛恨这个新政权，极力渲染要“暴露马阮的暴政”，要“通过侯李幸福的破灭，表现马阮统治阶级给人民的灾难”。他用截然相反的色彩和笔调，来描写马阮当政前的南京和马阮当政后的南京。在影片中，曾经两次描写侯朝宗进入媚香楼，两次推开窗户眺望秦淮河：第一次是“崇祯”末年，那时是阳光灿烂，一切都洋溢着蓬勃的生气；第二次是马阮当政以后，画面上顿然烟雾弥漫，一片萧索景象，形成了十分强烈的对比。
      “崇祯皇帝”和“福王”既然同属于一个朱明王朝，为什么作者把他们一忽儿说成“幸福”的天堂，一忽儿骂成黑暗的地狱？如果说，那是因为南明有着马阮的“暴政”，那么，在“崇祯”统治时期，难道不同样也是赤裸裸的地主阶级暴政吗？那时“朝政”的腐败，在历史上不也是尽人皆知的吗？作者所以如此地破绽百出，是无法自圆其说的，是别有一番用心的。按影片本身的逻辑，在“崇祯”死后，它攻击的矛头自然地要集中指向推翻这个地主阶级王朝的农民起义军。但是，电影编导知道，这样做就把自己暴露得太明显了。因此，不得不采取这种更加曲折的方式，拿“南明”来借题发挥，大做文章。
    在影片导演所作的阐述中，以刺耳的声调强调说：“福王”登基、马阮当政以后，“这段戏主要是描写时代的气氛。”
    好一个“时代气氛”！一句话暴露了电影编导者居心叵测，泄漏了他们的天机。他们是要借“南明”来影射解放后的新中国，以最恶毒的语言咒骂无产阶级专政，咒骂共产党，咒骂社会主义。一束仇恨新社会的怨毒之箭，就这样放肆地射出来了！
    请看，作者所要着力描写的是一种什么样的“时代气氛”呢？
    那是一个专制暴虐、暗无天日的时代。当时的统治者尽情搜刮，享乐腐化，对一切言论集会的自由都摧折无遗，对一切“评论朝政”的知识分子都横施迫害，务必“斩草除根”而后快。在银幕上，我们可以看到，一群群不满现状的知识分子被带上脚镣手铐，送入大牢；一处处知识分子聚居议论的场所门户紧锁，贴上封条；“外面到处在抓人”；侯、李的美满姻缘被活活拆散，幸福的生活全成泡影。
    那也是一个哀鸿遍野，民不聊生的时代。在电影文学剧本中，我们可以读到这样的词句：“路边十室九空，村户萧条，大道上流离失所的难民，蓬首垢面，辗转沟壑。”“三三五五的流民，迈着沉重的脚步。斜阳把他们瘦长的影子印在荒芜的田埂上。”
    够了，够了！明眼人一看就懂得：电影的编导为什么要在一九六二年、一九六三年这样大声疾呼地起来反对所谓南明的暴政呢？是谁在光辉灿烂的社会主义新中国怀着如此阴森冰凉的心情？是谁在劳动人民当家作主人的新中国处处感到受着迫害，没有自由，哀叹自己幸福的幻灭？是谁在中国人民高举三面红旗战胜一切困难阔步前进的时候，感到满目凄凉，一片荒芜？不是别人，正是一小撮失去了原有“天堂”的剥削阶级分子，正是一小撮被人民专了政的地富反坏右。影片《桃花扇》，所以在当时要突出地描写这些，不过是为了借题发挥，反映这一小撮牛鬼蛇神的心声！
    影片编导按捺不下那股对党对社会主义的刻骨仇恨，在“逼嫁”这场戏中，借李香君的嘴破口大骂：
  “你们这群奴才，不要欺人太甚！”“相府权势再大，大不过一条命去！”这时，天空乌云片片，寒风阵阵吹来，月亮也暗淡无光。画外歌声是：“满楼霜月夜迢迢，天明恨不消。”作者在这里充分地发泄了内心的“恨”。在他们看来，周围是长夜漫漫，一片漆黑，但是他们决不“屈服”，期待着“天明”。就是到那个时候，他们的“恨”还不消。他们是准备着进行一场阶级大报复的。
    接着，作者又精心设计了“骂宴”这场戏，“痛快淋漓”地发挥了他们反革命的“骂”的精神，说是要在“大庭广众之下义骂奸党”，使“观众为香君的命运担心，但也大快人心”，形成了全剧的最高潮。这不是和吴晗反复强调的什么要“骂得非常之痛快”，什么“在戏上骂骂，痛快一下，也是好的”等等，唱的是一个调子吗？
    可是，就连这样的“骂”，剧作者还怕人不懂，还觉得不够满足，还不能消解他们长期郁积的心头之恨，因此，在痛骂一顿之后，又借李香君之口，加重语气地唱出：“声声骂，看你懂不懂”，并且紧接着又特地安排杨龙友探望李香君的一场戏，让李香君说出这样一段极端刻毒的话来：“生就的脾气，见了那一般奸党，就恨不得撕下他们一块皮来！”他们觉得：只有这样骂，才能发泄那种对共产党的极端强烈的反革命阶级仇恨，才能激起一切牛鬼蛇神的强烈共鸣，鼓舞他们一齐起来，从事反革命的复辟活动。
    一“恨”二“骂”，这正是当时国内一切地富反坏右、一切牛鬼蛇神的共同心声。他们对共产党，对新中国确实是“恨不消”的，确实是这样憋着满腔仇恨的。《海瑞罢官》在骂，《李慧娘》在骂，《谢瑶环》在骂，国内外一切阶级敌人无不这样咬牙切齿地在骂。这种与中国人民为敌到底的反革命死硬精神，也是电影《桃花扇》所鼓吹的反革命“气节”的又一个重要内容。
  狂热歌颂“东林精神”，鼓吹反革命暴乱
    为了极力鼓吹这种反革命的“气节”，电影编导把它概括起来，具体化起来，打出一面旗号，叫做“东林精神”。
    大家知道，在历史上，东林、复社都是地主阶级在野的反对派。东林党人，当时正是以“气节”相标榜，自称“不随流俗”，不断“裁量人物、訾议朝政”，一时在封建士大夫中多“以清议归于东林”。复社继东林而起，有“小东林”之称。这些，原来都只是地主阶级内部一些大狗、小狗、饱狗、饿狗之间的矛盾表现，在历史上并不占什么重要的位置，到今天更是不值人们一顾的僵尸！
    可是，就是这具微不足道的僵尸，前几年却突然受到那群反党反社会主义的黑帮的青睐。邓拓极力赞扬“东林党人在政治上的抱负”，称颂他们“力抗权奸志不移，东林一代好男儿”。周予同极力强调“东林党人不可欺”。李平心一意为东林张目。梅阡、孙敬在《桃花扇》中同样也把东林、复社精神捧上了天！
    影片一开始，我们就可以看到：一大群复社文人聚会在一起，相互标榜：“我们读书人首先重气节。”李香君所以爱侯朝宗，不为别的，就因为“侯公子是当今名士，复社清流。”苏昆生接着就插上一句：“你没听说，家家夫婿是东林的话吗？”在“骂宴”一场中，更借李香君之口，一字一顿地唱出：“东林伯仲，俺青楼皆知敬重。”事实上，电影中李香君的形象本身就是作者借来表现“东林精神”的工具。她是一条披着桃花似的画皮的大毒蛇。我们一定要拦头打死这条毒蛇！
    三百多年前东林、复社的僵尸，到二十世纪六十年代的今天，引起这伙反革命黑帮如此浓厚的兴趣，这自然不是出于什么历史的爱好，而是为了适应他们现实的反革命复辟需要。
    他们所以这样热中于宣传东林、复社，只是为了要鼓吹它所代表的那种“反对派”的精神！
    他们所以这样热中于宣传东林、复社，只是为了借“东林”的旗号宣扬他们那套为蒋介石效忠、同新中国为敌到底的反革命“气节”。
    他们所以这样热中于宣传东林、复社，并且借复社文人之口说：“你说国事不堪问，可是我们不问有谁来问呢？”就是为了用“东林精神”，来鼓舞一切反革命的知识分子起来为蒋家王朝的复辟打头阵。在他们看来，今天，这一群反革命的知识分子还是比较有资本同社会主义较量一番的。需要由这批知识分子出来动员舆论，为反革命复辟作准备。鼓吹所谓“东林精神”，又正是为了使这些反革命的知识分子以及一切牛鬼蛇神，从思想上得到鼓舞，在精神上找到支持的力量，同共产党“斗争”到底！
    作者还力图将一切可能为他们利用的知识分子都集合到他们的反革命旗号下。影片中的侯朝宗，投清后虽然拖着一条长辫子到“葆贞观”来，受到李香君的“严厉斥责”。但是，从整个影片来看，投降变节的侯朝宗是被极力美化、极力歌颂的。他在扬州危急时的溜走，被说成是“书生徒死无益”。他的应试，也是因为“江山易主，社稷全非”，不得已而为之的一种权宜之计。“葆贞观”那场戏完全是外加的。就在这场戏中，侯朝宗也还是那么一派“正人君子”的风度，表现出内心十分痛苦。这是作者向他们的主子表明心迹，说明自己今天在新中国工作，是“身在曹营心在汉”。作者对那些在他们眼中“东林精神”已有所欠缺、已经在为新社会工作的旧知识分子，既有所指责，又寄以期望，督促他们不要老跟着共产党走，要回过头来，跟他们一起造反。影片中的杨龙友，也是经过作者精心雕琢寓有深意的人物。照导演在阐述中说，这是个“两不得罪”的“好好先生”，结果却“四面受难”，最后也走上和马阮决绝的道路。他们正是想通过这个人物，号召那些在他们看来处于“中间状态”的知识分子，不要对共产党存在幻想，不要怕“得罪”共产党，也要起来和共产党斗争！
      “莫谓书生空议论，头颅掷处血斑斑”。邓拓这两句歌颂东林党人的诗句，一语道破了谜底。他们这样做，决不是什么“书生空议论”。“项庄舞剑，意在沛公”。他们的一切目的，都是为了夺取政权。他们已经不惜“头颅掷处血斑斑”，准备和共产党作拚死的斗争了。他们妄图实现反革命的复辟，把中国重新拉回到半殖民地半封建社会的万丈深渊去，把劳动人民重新抛到一片血泊之中！
    请听影片结尾时的画外歌声：“儿女浓情一笔销，桃花扇底送南朝，扯碎扯碎一条条，再一番鲜血满扇开红桃，开红桃！”当歌声唱到“再一番鲜血满扇开红桃”时，电影的镜头立刻转到一株盛开的红桃，全剧就在歌声中结束。他们是在公开号召一切反革命分子起来，进行反革命暴乱，“再一番鲜血满扇”地对革命人民动刀枪，推翻无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，恢复他们已经失去的“天堂”，实现他们梦寐以求的反革命复辟。
    在银幕上，我们已经可以看到闪闪的刀光剑影，已经可以闻到一股浓烈的血腥气了！
    值得严重注意的是：梅阡、孙敬这两个人原来都是历史极其肮脏的家伙。孙敬是三十年代电影界的右翼，在抗战时期做过汉奸。抗日战争胜利后，又卖身投靠国民党，拍摄过专门歌颂国民党特务的反动影片。解放后，又一贯表现反动。梅阡同他也是一丘之貉。那几年，中国人民遭受了一些暂时的困难，国内外阶级敌人一度气势嚣张，蒋介石匪帮积极地准备窜犯大陆，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派也在拚命反华。在这种形势下，周扬黑帮也在电影界召集会议，举办学习班，煽风点火。周扬在全国故事片创作会议上高喊“我们要培养海瑞上本的精神”，要求作家
  “以天下为己任”，“有自己的理想标准”，努力去发掘“有意志、能行动的理想人物”。梅阡、孙敬大受鼓舞。他们以为时机到了，以为共产党的江山已经处在“风雨飘摇”中了，于是急忙忙在北京写出剧本，兴冲冲地拍马上阵，叫嚷着“暴政的崩溃”，抛出了他们号召反革命复辟的宣言书，盼望中国改变颜色。
    可是，他们瞎了眼！中国劳动人民的江山是铁打的江山。小小几条蚍蜉怎能撼动这参天的大树！客观事物的发展，总是和这批反革命分子的主观愿望背道而驰。他们那样做，不但没有捞到任何好处，相反，却把自己极端丑恶的反动嘴脸来了个彻底的大暴露。
    现在，一个伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的高潮已经在全国范围内兴起。广大工农兵群众已经奋起斗争，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。这是大海的怒涛，这是时代的狂飚！锋芒所向，牛鬼蛇神原形毕露，藏身无地，他们将葬身于这个革命洪流之中！
