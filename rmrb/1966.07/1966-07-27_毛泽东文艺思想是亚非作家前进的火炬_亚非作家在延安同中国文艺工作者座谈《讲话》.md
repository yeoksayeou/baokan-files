On July 1st, the magazine *Red Flag* reprinted Chairman Mao's *Talks at the Yanan Forum on Literature and Art*. On the morning of July 19th, some representatives attending the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers, with hearts full of longing for Yan'an, arrived at the place where Chairman Mao once lived—Yangjialing. It was here in May 1942 that Chairman Mao delivered this *Talk*. The representatives entered the conference room of the original office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which was the venue for the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art at that time. Here, the Asian and African writers, along with some Chinese writers and Yan'an's literary and artistic workers, held a symposium.

After a Chinese writer introduced the historical background and great significance of Chairman Mao's *Talk*, the Asian and African writers took the floor one after another, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao Zedong's work. They believed that Mao Zedong's literary thought, which creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory, is a torch illuminating the path for Asian and African writers.

The Philippine writer Hernandez said at the meeting that he had read Chairman Mao's work several times. He firmly believed that Chairman Mao is not only a great revolutionary leader, a brilliant politician, and economist, but also a cultural giant. This Philippine friend emphasized that Asian and African revolutionary writers should follow Chairman Mao's instructions given 24 years ago. The famous Angolan writer Dakru said that Chairman Mao Zedong's work is not something that can be fully understood by reading it once or visiting Yan'an once; it requires a lifetime of revolutionary struggle to learn. He pointed out that Chairman Mao's *Talk* is very important for the people of Africa. Mao Zedong's literary thought was developed in the struggle against various enemies. Mao Zedong thought is the guiding ideology for all revolutions. It not only guides the world's revolutionary literary and artistic workers but also guides the oppressed peoples of various countries in the world. Only by uniting under the banner of Mao Zedong can we achieve victory.

The famous Thai writer Kula Siparat said that in this work, Chairman Mao gave a detailed and clear answer to the question of whom literature and art should serve. Literature and art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers well, and literary and artistic workers must integrate with the masses. This is a very precious instruction. This work has left a deep impression on us. It is a torch illuminating the direction of our country's literary creation. Under the illumination of this torch, our literature and art are becoming revolutionary weapons in the current struggle against American imperialism.

The Indonesian writer Wisbi said that Chairman Mao's *Talk* has opened up a brilliant future for revolutionary literary and artistic workers. He expressed that in the future, he would better learn from the masses, better integrate with the masses, and better study Mao Zedong Thought.

The writer Hongzhang from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam praised Chairman Mao's *Talk* as a great contribution to Marxist-Leninist literary theory because it answers many fundamental questions in the field of literature and art.

When the symposium ended, the deputy commissioner of the Yan'an Special District, Tu Jinzhang, on behalf of the people of Yan'an, presented the Asian and African friends with English and French translations of Chairman Mao's *Talk*, as well as ceramic models of the cave where Chairman Mao once lived in Yangjialing. The representatives cherished these gifts. Some excitedly held the gifts in their arms; some carefully wrapped the gifts with handkerchiefs; some sat on benches and read them immediately. The representative from the Comoros Islands, Buwana, said, "I will take these gifts back and place them on my desk to show my relatives and friends."

The Asian and African writers participated in labor at the fields where Chairman Mao once worked in Yangjialing. The representative from Sierra Leone, Mrs. Grant, enthusiastically weeded and hoed corn while chatting. Some foreign friends linked Mao Zedong's discussion on the need for literary and artistic workers to undergo ideological transformation and shared their thoughts. The Indonesian representative Wisbi said that Chairman Mao said that literary and artistic workers should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, which is an absolute truth. Many representatives agreed that Chairman Mao was right, and all revolutionary literary and artistic workers should follow Chairman Mao's instructions.

In the small auditorium in Zao Yuan, where Chairman Mao often met with the masses, the representatives sat with Han Qixiang, vice chairman of the Chinese Folk Artists Association and a folk artist. Han Qixiang, the son of a poor peasant, had worked for landlords in the old society and later joined the revolutionary literary and artistic work. From 1944 to the present, he has created more than 350 pieces of literature. He often goes deep into the countryside, lives with the peasants, seeks their opinions on his works, and performs for them. Han Qixiang, through his personal experience, talked about how Chairman Mao's words are all truths, and revolutionary literary and artistic workers should follow Chairman Mao's teachings throughout their lives, go deep into the countryside for a long time, and wholeheartedly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Then, he sang a segment from his self-composed *The Story of Liberation* for the foreign friends. His sincere literature aroused prolonged applause from the representatives. As soon as the three-stringed instrument stopped, many representatives rushed up to shake hands or hug him.

After returning to the hotel, the Thai representative Kula Siparat held Han Qixiang's hand and said, "Your achievements are the result of Mao Zedong Thought, faithfully executing Mao Zedong's literary line, integrating with the masses, and the spirit of hard work. You are a good example for us to learn from."

During their visit to China, the Asian and African writers watched professional literary and artistic workers perform revolutionary modern Beijing operas, spoken dramas, revolutionary ballets, operas, as well as performances by the Guangzhou Military Region's marine cultural work team and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Ulan Mus. They not only saw the thriving revolutionary literature and art guided by Mao Zedong's literary thought serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers but also saw that the workers, peasants, and soldiers have become the masters of today's Chinese stage. This visit to Yan'an allowed them to come into contact with some amateur literary and artistic workers, and everyone was surprised and highly admired that the workers, peasants, and soldiers in Yan'an could write poetry, compose scripts, write lyrics, and compose music.

After Chairman Mao delivered the *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*, Li Youyuan, a poor peasant from northern Shaanxi, created the world-famous lyrics for *The East Is Red* under the guidance of the *Talk*, expressing the boundless love of the broad masses of laboring people for the Party and Chairman Mao. Now, this song has become the most beloved revolutionary song of the people of the whole country and the world. An African friend, after learning about this, excitedly said, "I like *The East Is Red* the most."

The amateur writer from Yan'an, Liu Deqin, who had attended the National Conference of Active Young Amateur Literary Creators, told her friends that she is a member of the Liu Lin Production Brigade, and many members of this brigade have already mastered the weapon of literature and art, creating many poems and scripts praising the Communist Party, praising Chairman Mao, and praising the heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought. These works have inspired the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm and promoted socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Thai friend nodded in agreement, and Kula Siparat said, "China has such a young generation. Imperialism's hope of restoring capitalism by relying on the third generation will definitely be dashed. The Japanese friend Terada Nobuyoshi said, "The 700 million people of China, under the guidance of Chairman Mao, will definitely produce more workers, peasants, and soldiers writers. The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will definitely promote the works of Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers writers to achieve greater progress. He expressed his belief that Chairman Mao's *Talk* has taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit among the 700 million people of China.

Before leaving Yan'an, many representatives, with excited hearts, talked about how their visit to Yan'an, observation, and symposium deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's work. An African friend said, "Undoubtedly, Mao Zedong's literary thought is the highest, most comprehensive, most systematic, and most thorough contribution to Marxist-Leninist literary thought." Many foreign friends expressed that they would continue to study Mao Zedong's literary thought well, embody it in revolutionary practice, and definitely spread Mao Zedong's literary thought to Asian and African revolutionary writers and the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    毛泽东文艺思想是亚非作家前进的火炬
    ——亚非作家在延安同中国文艺工作者座谈《讲话》
    七月一日，《红旗》杂志重新发表了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。七月十九日上午，出席亚非作家紧急会议的部分代表怀着对延安无限向往的心情，来到了毛主席曾经居住过的地方——杨家岭。一九四二年五月，毛主席就是在这里发表这篇《讲话》的。代表们步入中共中央原办公厅的会议室，这里是当年延安文艺座谈会会址。在这里，亚非作家们同一些中国作家，延安的文艺工作者一起举行座谈会。
    一位中国作家介绍了毛主席发表《讲话》的历史背景和伟大意义以后，亚非作家相继发言，热烈颂扬毛泽东主席的这部著作，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论，毛泽东文艺思想是照亮亚非作家前进的火炬。
    菲律宾作家埃尔南德斯在会上说，毛主席这篇著作他已读过数遍，他深信，毛主席不仅是一位伟大的革命领袖，一位天才的政治家和经济学家，也是一位文化巨人。这位菲律宾朋友强调指出，亚非革命作家都应该很好地遵循毛主席在二十四年前所发表的这一指示。安哥拉著名作家达克鲁斯说，毛泽东主席这篇著作决不是读一遍，或访问一次延安就能够完全理解的，需要我们在终身的革命斗争中去学习。他指出，毛主席的这篇《讲话》对非洲儿女是非常重要的。毛泽东文艺思想是在同形形色色的敌人的斗争中发展起来的。毛泽东思想是一切革命的指导思想，它不仅指导世界革命的文艺工作者，也指导着世界上被压迫的各国人民。只有在毛泽东旗帜下团结起来，才能获得胜利。
    泰国著名作家古腊·柿巴立说，毛主席在这篇著作中对于文艺应该为谁服务的问题，作出了详细的、明确的答案。文艺要很好地为工农兵服务，文艺工作者就必须和群众相结合。这是十分宝贵的指示。这篇著作给我们留下了深刻的印象，它是一把照亮我国文艺创作方向的火炬。我们的文艺在这把火炬的照耀下，正在成为目前进行反对美帝国主义的革命武器。
    印度尼西亚作家维斯比说，毛主席这篇《讲话》给革命的文艺工作者的前途开辟了光辉的道路。他表示，今后要更好地向人民群众学习，更好地和人民群众打成一片，更好地学习毛泽东思想。
    越南民主共和国作家鸿章赞扬毛主席这篇《讲话》是对马克思列宁主义的文艺理论的一个巨大贡献，因为它解答了文艺领域内的许多基本问题。
    座谈会结束的时候，延安专员公署副专员土金璋代表延安人民把毛主席的《讲话》英、法文译本，和毛主席在杨家岭住过的窑洞的陶瓷模型等送给亚非朋友，代表们非常珍视这些礼品，有的激动地把礼品抱在怀里；有的精心地用手帕把礼品包起来；有的当时就坐在板凳上读起来。科摩罗群岛代表布瓦纳说，“我要把这些礼品带回去摆在我的案头上，告诉我的亲戚朋友。”
    亚非作家们在杨家岭毛主席种过的地里参加了劳动。塞拉勒窝内代表格兰特夫人，兴致勃勃地一边给玉米培土，一边用手拔草。有的外国朋友联系毛主席关于文艺工作者要进行思想改造的论述，发表了不少感想。印度尼西亚代表维斯比说，毛主席说，文艺工作者应该为工农兵服务，这是千真万确的真理。许多代表认为，毛主席说得很对，一切革命的文艺工作者都应该遵循毛主席的这个指示去做。
    在当年毛主席经常接见群众的枣园小礼堂，代表们和中国曲艺工作者协会副主席、民间艺人韩起祥一起座谈。韩起祥是个贫农的儿子，在旧社会给地主揽过工，后来参加了革命的文艺工作。从一九四四年到现在，他共创作了书词三百五十多篇。他经常深入农村，和农民一起生活，征求农民对他的作品的意见，并为他们演唱。韩起祥以他亲身的经历谈到，毛主席的话句句是真理，革命的文艺工作者应该终身按照毛主席的教导去做，长期深入农村，全心全意为工农兵服务。接着，他为外国朋友们弹唱了自编的书词《翻身记》中的一段。他的充满真挚感情的书词激起了代表们长时间的热烈掌声。三弦声刚停，不少代表就拥上来，争着跟他握手或拥抱。
    回到宾馆后，泰国代表古腊·柿巴立握着韩起祥的手说，你的成就是毛泽东思想哺育的结果，是忠实地执行毛泽东的文艺路线，是深入群众和群众相结合，以及艰苦奋斗的精神取得的。你是我们学习的好榜样。
    亚非作家们这次来到中国，先后观看了专业文艺工作者演出的革命现代京剧、话剧、革命的芭蕾舞剧、歌剧以及广州部队海上文化工作队和内蒙古自治区乌兰牧骑等的演出。大家不仅看到了在毛泽东文艺思想指导下，为工农兵服务的革命文艺欣欣向荣的情况，也看到了工农兵已成为今天中国舞台上的主人。这次访问延安，他们又接触了一些业余文艺工作者，大家对延安工农兵群众能够写诗、编剧、作词、作曲，更表示了惊讶和十分钦佩。
    毛主席发表《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》以后，陕北贫农李有源在《讲话》的指引下，创作了闻名世界的《东方红》歌词，表达了广大劳动人民对党和毛主席无比的热爱。现在，这首歌已成为全国、全世界革命人民最爱唱的一首革命歌曲。一位非洲朋友得知这个情况后，兴奋地说，我最喜欢《东方红》。
    延安的农民业余作者、曾经出席过全国青年业余文学创作积极分子大会的刘德琴，告诉朋友们她是柳林生产大队的社员，这个大队的不少社员已经掌握了文艺武器，创作了许多歌颂共产党、歌颂毛主席、歌颂用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物的诗歌和剧本。这些作品，鼓舞了群众的革命干劲，推动了社会主义革命和社会主义建设。泰国朋友听了连连点头，差慝·柿巴立说，中国有这样的年轻一代，帝国主义把复辟资本主义的希望寄托在第三代身上，是一定会落空的。日本朋友寺田信义说，中国的七亿人民在毛主席的教导下，肯定会出现更多的工农兵作家。当前中国的文化大革命运动，一定会促使中国工农兵作家的作品，取得更大的进步。他表示深信，毛主席的《讲话》，已在中国七亿人民中扎了根、开了花、结了果。
    离开延安前，许多代表以激动的心情谈到通过对延安的参观、访问和座谈，进一步加深了对毛泽东主席这篇著作的理解。一位非洲朋友说，毫无疑问，毛泽东的文艺思想，是对马克思列宁主义文艺思想的最高、最全面、最系统、最彻底的贡献。不少外国朋友表示，要继续很好地学习毛泽东文艺思想，把它体现在革命的实践中。一定要把毛泽东文艺思想深入到亚非革命作家和工农兵群众中去。　（新华社记者、新华社通讯员）
