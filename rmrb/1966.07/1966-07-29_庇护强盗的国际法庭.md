The International Court of the United Nations, after six years of so-called "trial," recently brazenly rejected all the accusations made by independent African countries against the South African government's colonial rule in South West Africa. This is no surprise. The United Nations has long since degenerated into a tool of American imperialism. How could its International Court do anything good?

Both American imperialists and Soviet revisionists have been boasting about the United Nations, claiming that it is a "catalyst" for helping African countries and "guaranteeing their independence," and that it will "eliminate colonial rule." It seems as if the United Nations is the great savior of oppressed nations. Such lies are becoming less and less convincing.

The people of South West Africa have been under the colonial rule of South African white racists for forty-six years. The United Nations, which is supposed to "ultimately eliminate all forms of colonialism," not only has not "helped" the people of South West Africa gain independence, but has also rejected the accusations against the South African government's colonial rule. The reason is simple: the South African government and the United Nations' backers are both American imperialists. It is no secret that American imperialists are vigorously strengthening their political and economic infiltration of South Africa, aiming to turn it into a military base for their aggression against Africa.

The facts prove that the people of South West Africa and all oppressed nations and peoples, if they want to achieve their own freedom and liberation, must not place their hopes on the mercy of robbers. Robbers will never show mercy. Chairman Mao has long said: "Freedom is fought for by the people, not bestowed by anyone." Oppressed nations must break the illusion of the United Nations and, through their own resolute struggle, bury the colonial system and achieve independence, freedom, and liberation.

The chief representative of the South West Africa People's Organization in Tanzania, Boes, said well: "The inherent right of the people of South West Africa to achieve independence is an inalienable right that cannot be decided by any court." No matter how the imperialists and their accomplices and lackeys struggle, the day when the people of South West Africa overthrow the colonial mountain pressing down on them and take control of their own destiny will surely come.

### 庇护强盗的国际法庭

    庇护强盗的国际法庭
    联合国的国际法庭经过六年之久的“审理”，最近悍然否决了所有非洲独立国家提出的对于南非当局在西南非洲实行殖民统治的控诉。这是毫不奇怪的。联合国早已堕落成美帝国主义的工具，它所属下的国际法庭难道会干出什么好事情来吗？
    美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者都竭力吹捧联合国，说什么联合国是“帮助”非洲国家和“保证它们的独立的催化剂”，要“由联合国来消除殖民主义统治制度”，似乎联合国真是被压迫民族的大救星。这种鬼话越来越骗不了人了。
    西南非洲人民遭到南非白人种族主义者的殖民统治，已经四十六年。据说是要“最终消灭形形色色的殖民主义”的联合国，却不但没有“帮助”西南非洲人民得到独立，而且连对南非当局的殖民统治的控诉也加以否决。原因很简单，这是因为南非当局同联合国的后台老板，都是美帝国主义。美帝国主义竭力加强对南非的政治、经济上的渗透，要把南非变成它侵略非洲的军事基地，早已不是什么秘密了。
    事实证明，西南非洲人民和一切被压迫民族、被压迫人民，要想得到自己的自由和解放，决不能把希望寄托在强盗发善心上。强盗决不会发善心。毛主席早就说过：“自由是人民争来的，不是什么人恩赐的。”被压迫民族只有破除对联合国之类的迷信，经过自己的坚决的斗争，才能埋葬殖民主义制度，获得独立、自由和解放。
    西南非洲民族联盟驻坦桑尼亚的首席代表博伊斯说得好，西南非洲人民“实现独立的天赋权利是不能剥夺的权利，是不能由任何法院作出决定的。”不管帝国主义及其帮凶和走狗怎样挣扎，西南非洲人民推翻压在他们头上的殖民主义大山、掌握自己命运的一天，是一定要到来的。
