Farmers in Hongdong County, Shanxi Province, specifically those in the Yangzhuang Production Brigade of Yandi Commune, have embodied the spirit of self-reliance and daring innovation. They have successfully created a manual vacuum water pump. This manual vacuum water pump operates by using a leather water bucket to pull water, facilitating irrigation. Its water lifting efficiency is high; one laborer can irrigate 1.5 to 2 mu of land in eight hours, with a lifting height of up to seven meters.

This manual vacuum water pump belongs to the piston pump category but has several advantages that other pumps do not possess. These advantages include: low cost, with each unit requiring only 3 to 5 yuan in addition to the pipes, making it feasible for production teams to manufacture and repair themselves; easy mobility, simple installation, and straightforward operation. The entire machine can be moved by one person and installed within an hour to start pumping water, making it highly popular among the masses.

　　洪洞农民敢想敢干
　　制成人力真空抽水器
    山西省洪洞县淹底公社杨张生产大队的社员，发扬自力更生、敢想敢干的革命精神，创造成功一种人力真空抽水器。这种人力真空抽水器，是靠皮水斗对水的抽拉作用，提水进行灌溉。它的提水率较高，一个劳动力操作，八小时可浇地一亩半到二亩，提程可达到七米。
    这种人力真空抽水器，原理属于活塞水泵类，但它有许多优点是其它水泵所没有的。这些优点是：成本低，除管子外，每台只要三到五元钱，生产队就可自造自修；移动方便，安装容易，操作技术也很简单，全部机体一个人即可搬动，最多用一小时就可安装好进行抽水，因此很受群众欢迎。
