Many delegates were greatly inspired and encouraged.

	During the performance, representatives from various countries followed the plot development, sometimes expressing indignation and sometimes applauding enthusiastically. Their emotions blended with those of the actors portraying the Congolese people's battle life. After the performance, the entire audience stood up, and the applause was like a storm, lasting for a long time. Representatives from various countries presented flower baskets to the actors.
