First, allow me to represent the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China to convey the warmest and most militant greetings of solidarity to the Chinese representatives and friends attending today's rally, as well as to friends from various countries.

Comrades and friends:

Recently, starting from June 29, U.S. imperialism dispatched aircraft to bomb the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the suburbs of Hai Phong, our country's second-largest city in the north. This is a new "escalation" in the U.S. imperialists' dirty war of aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, a blatant violation of Vietnam's sovereignty and national independence, and a brazen provocation against socialist countries and all peace-loving and justice-seeking countries in the world.

The aforementioned crimes of U.S. imperialism not only fail to intimidate the Vietnamese people but, on the contrary, reflect the military and political desperation faced by the U.S. and its lackeys in South Vietnam, especially after suffering heavy defeats in the recent dry season.

It is well known that after suffering a severe setback in implementing the "special war" strategy, U.S. imperialism increased its troop deployment to South Vietnam, pushing the war of aggression to a new and more intense stage. In the recent dry season, U.S. imperialism mobilized a massive force of 250,000 U.S. troops, 30,000 mercenaries, and 400,000 puppet troops, and concentrated its air force, firepower, and absolute superiority in troops to launch the "dry season strategic offensive," aiming to annihilate the armed forces of South Vietnam, occupy the liberated areas, threaten the people of South Vietnam, pacify the countryside, and stabilize the cities, regain the initiative on the battlefield, and ultimately achieve decisive victory. However, they miscalculated. In reality, the situation on the South Vietnam battlefield has developed in the opposite direction of their arrogant fantasies. According to statistics, from November 1965 to March 1966, a total of 43,000 U.S. and mercenary troops and 71,000 puppet troops were annihilated; 1,440 U.S. aircraft were shot down or destroyed; 1,310 various military vehicles were destroyed.

The glorious victory achieved by the military and civilian people of South Vietnam is of immense significance. The people of South Vietnam have defeated the U.S. imperialists' local war from the very beginning. The military and civilian people of South Vietnam not only defeated the enemy, annihilated a significant portion of the U.S. puppet troops' fighting force, but also preserved and developed their own strength; not only held onto but also liberated more land. This victory fully demonstrates the high resolve of the people of South Vietnam, their determination to fight the Americans, defeat the Americans, crush the puppet troops, fear no sacrifice, endure hardships, maintain and strengthen their initiative, launch continuous attacks, and resolutely smash the U.S. imperialists' dry season offensive plans. This victory also eloquently shows that the people of South Vietnam have correctly applied the strategies and tactics of people's war. Under the wise leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, all the advantages of the people's war in South Vietnam have been demonstrated; it is invincible and can completely defeat the so-called strongest and most modern U.S. expeditionary invasion forces in the capitalist world in South Vietnam. This victory has already caused a huge response among the puppet troops, puppet government, and the people of various strata in the cities, making the anti-U.S. forces within the enemy's lair and among the U.S. combat units even more developed, making the already decaying puppet troops more disintegrated than ever. Currently, the people's struggle in various cities is like a storm, especially the mass movements since mid-March 1966, which have made the enemy extremely panicked.

Faced with continuous defeats, U.S. imperialism is trying every means to salvage the situation. It is striving to continue increasing troops, bringing more weapons and war materials into South Vietnam. Currently, the number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam has reached over 280,000, ten times the number at the beginning of 1965. It is forcing Park Chung-hee, Australia, the Philippines, Thailand, and other lackeys to send more mercenaries to South Vietnam and instructing other lackeys, such as Japan and West Germany, to provide war equipment and combat materials for the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression in South Vietnam. The U.S. expeditionary forces are continuously conducting "sweeps," killing and arson, dispatching B-52 aircraft to continuously bomb densely populated areas, and using chemical poisons and gases on a large scale in South Vietnam, committing extremely barbaric crimes. Recently, on July 1, 1966, U.S. imperialism dispatched aircraft to barbarically bomb and strafe a primary school and a large market in the New Yen area of Bien Hoa Province, resulting in over 60 casualties, most of whom were schoolchildren.

While vigorously intensifying and expanding the Vietnam War, strengthening the war of aggression against Laos, provoking and sabotaging the independence and neutrality of Cambodia, and creating a highly tense situation in Indochina and Southeast Asia, the U.S. authorities are constantly shouting about "peace," "unconditional discussions," and other slogans to deceive world public opinion. However, people can see clearly that all the arguments of U.S. imperialism, despite their variations, have only one content: to stubbornly stay in South Vietnam, strive to maintain the puppet government it has set up, and attempt to permanently divide Vietnam's territory, refusing to acknowledge the Vietnamese people's right to resolve their internal affairs. The Vietnamese people and the people of the world have already rejected the deceptive means of seeking "peace" played by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices like Tito, Indira Gandhi, and Wilson.

The actual situation on the South Vietnam battlefield shows that the more U.S. aggressor troops are sent to South Vietnam, the more are annihilated, and the more miserable their defeats. Every time the U.S. bandits "escalate" the war in North Vietnam, it further arouses the indignation of the military and civilian people of South Vietnam, making them fight even more fiercely. On June 30, the day after the U.S. bandits bombed the suburbs of Hanoi and Hai Phong, the military and civilian people of South Vietnam completely annihilated a tank and armored car regiment of the U.S. First Infantry Division on National Highway 13, north of the Keo Ray Bridge, about 100 kilometers north of Saigon, destroying over 40 tanks and armored cars and annihilating all the enemy troops on the vehicles. On July 1 and 2, they completely annihilated an entire battalion of the U.S. First Infantry Division in the Cat Lo area, about 10 kilometers northwest of the Keo Ray Bridge in Tuyen Duc Province. This glorious victory shows that the military and civilian people of South Vietnam have implemented the words of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in its March 22, 1965, declaration: "If the U.S. imperialists invade our northern homeland once, the military and people of the South are determined to retaliate against them twofold, threefold." The victories at Keo Ray Bridge and dozens of other engagements since May have annihilated and severely depleted the enemy's more than ten battalions and dozens of companies, shattering the war-mongering Johnson's boast that the military situation in South Vietnam is "improving," and is also a powerful proof of the rapid growth of the military and civilian people of South Vietnam.

While the military and civilian people of South Vietnam are achieving victory after victory, our compatriots in North Vietnam are also continuously dealing heavy blows to the enemy. As of July 8, 1966, 1,182 U.S. bandit aircraft have been shot down over the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and this is not the final number. If U.S. imperialism continues to stubbornly carry out its foolish "escalation," the number will only increase.

The Vietnamese people have punished the U.S. aggressors with fatal blows, using actual actions to tell them that all conspiracies and threats cannot make the Vietnamese nation surrender. U.S. imperialism cannot use the bombing of North Vietnam as a means to threaten the people of South Vietnam, forcing the military and civilian people of South Vietnam to lay down their arms and surrender. The military and civilian people of South Vietnam are determined to fight to the end, defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and will definitely achieve their sacred wish: independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and ultimately the reunification of the motherland.

Comrades and friends:

In the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, the people of South Vietnam have received invaluable and increasingly powerful sympathy and support from the people of socialist countries, the international working class, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all peace-loving people around the world. On this occasion, please allow us to express our heartfelt thanks to the people of various countries who have enthusiastically supported us.

From the very beginning of our struggle in South Vietnam, filled with sacrifice and hardship, the Chinese people have stood with us, fully sympathizing with and supporting us. Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out in his statement on August 29, 1963: "We Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam. I am deeply convinced that the people of South Vietnam will definitely achieve the goal of liberating South Vietnam through struggle and make a contribution to the peaceful reunification of the motherland."

Recently, the statement issued by the Government of the People's Republic of China on July 3, 1966, clearly pointed out: "China has always, unconditionally, and to the best of its ability supported and aided Vietnam politically, morally, materially, and in other ways. Now, due to the development of the U.S. imperialist war of aggression to a new and more serious stage, our support and aid are even more unrestricted and unlimited. We will take actions we deem necessary at any time, based on the interests of the Vietnamese people and the demands of the Vietnamese people." This is the voice of the great 700 million Chinese people, and it is the iron will of every Chinese person.

In recent years, the "Support Vietnam, Resist America" movement has been flourishing across the vast land of China. In the army, factories, enterprises, people's communes, construction sites, and schools, everyone is competing to increase production and make contributions to support Vietnam. People of all strata in China, regardless of gender or age, even schoolchildren, have joined the "Support Vietnam, Resist America" movement. We receive letters from the Chinese people every day, expressing their determination to support the people of South Vietnam in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and their readiness to share life and death with the people of South Vietnam. So far, tens of thousands of Chinese people have volunteered to go to South Vietnam to fight side by side with the people of South Vietnam. This is a brilliant manifestation of the combat unity and friendship between the people of China and Vietnam.

We highly appreciate the most resolute, most powerful, and most effective support from the Chinese people. It is this great support and the support from the people of other brother countries that has greatly enhanced the fighting potential of the people of South Vietnam and brought them great inspiration.

Here, allow me to once again express the deep gratitude of the people of South Vietnam and the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to the great Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party led by the beloved Chairman Mao.

Comrades and friends:

The current actions of U.S. imperialism to intensify and expand the war in South Vietnam show that their aggressive and war-mongering nature will not change. Therefore, the only correct path for the people of South Vietnam to achieve final victory is, as pointed out by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in its March 22, 1965, declaration, to take the path of decisive battle, defeat the enemy, liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the motherland.

We, the people of South Vietnam, firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the only true representative of the people of South Vietnam—the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, with the united support of all our compatriots in the North, and with the sympathy and support of the Chinese people and the people of various countries around the world, the people of South Vietnam, who are united and determined to fight, will definitely achieve final victory.

Vietnam will win!
The U.S. imperialists will be defeated!
Long live the indestructible combat unity between the peoples of Vietnam and China!
Long live the combat unity of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all peace-loving and justice-seeking peoples around the world in their common struggle for national independence, democracy, peace, and social progress!

　　陈文成团长在首都群众大会上讲话
　　美帝的阴谋诡计威胁恫吓都不能使越南屈服  中国最有效的支持是对南越人民的巨大鼓舞
    首先，请允许我代表越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团，向出席今天大会的各位中国代表和朋友们以及各国朋友转达越南南方人民最热烈的战斗团结的敬意。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    最近，从六月二十九日开始，美帝国主义派遣飞机轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内，和我们祖国北方第二个大城市海防的郊区。这是美帝国主义在侵略越南民主共和国的肮脏战争中新的“升级”，是对越南人民的主权和民族独立的明目张胆的侵犯，是对社会主义国家以及世界上一切热爱和平和主持正义的国家肆无忌惮的挑衅。
    美帝国主义的上述罪行，不仅丝毫也威胁不了越南人民，相反地更加反映了美国及其走狗在越南南方，尤其是在最近旱季中不断遭到沉重失败之后所面临的军事和政治上的山穷水尽的困境。
    众所周知，美帝国主义推行“特种战争”的战略遭到惨重失败之后，就向越南南方大量增兵，把侵略战争推进到一个新的更加激烈的阶段。在最近的旱季中，美帝国主义调遣了包括二十五万美军、三万仆从军队和四十万伪军的庞大兵力，并高度集中空军、火力和绝对优势的兵力发动“旱季战略攻势”，妄图消灭越南南方解放武装力量，侵占解放区，威胁越南南方人民，平定农村和稳定城市，夺回战场上的主动权，进而取得决定性的胜利。但是，它们打错了算盘。实际上，南方战场形势的发展，同它们狂妄的幻想完全相反。据统计，一九六五年十一月到一九六六年三月，共歼灭美军和仆从军四万三千名，伪军七万一千名；击落和击毁美机一千四百四十架；击毁各种军用车辆一千三百一十辆。
    越南南方军民所取得的这个辉煌胜利，具有无比重大的意义。越南南方人民早在初期就战胜了美帝国主义发动的局部战争。越南南方军民不仅战胜了敌人，消灭了美伪军一部分重要的有生力量，而且还保存和发展了自己的力量；不仅保住了，而且还解放了更多的土地。这个胜利充分体现了越南南方人民高度的决心，敢打美国佬，决心战胜美国佬，压倒伪军，不畏牺牲，不怕艰苦，不断保持和加强主动地位，连续发动进攻，坚决粉碎美帝国主义旱季攻势的计划。这个胜利还雄辩地表明，越南南方人民正确地运用了人民战争的战略战术。在越南南方民族解放阵线的英明领导下，越南南方人民战争的一切优越性已经表明，它是所向无敌的，完全能够打败在越南南方的号称资本主义世界最强大和最现代化的美国远征侵略军。这个胜利，已经在伪军、伪政权以及城市各阶层人民中引起巨大的反响，使得在敌人巢穴中和在美国战斗部队中的反美力量也更加发展，使得早就衰败的伪军比任何时候都更加土崩瓦解。当前各城市人民的斗争运动犹如暴风骤雨，特别是从一九六六年三月中旬以来的群众运动，使敌人非常惊慌失措。
    美帝国主义在不断遭到失败的情况下，想尽一切办法来挽救败局。它正在竭力继续增兵，把更多的武器和战争物资运进越南南方。目前，在越南南方的美军已经达到二十八万多名，相当于一九六五年初的十倍。它正在迫使朴正熙、澳大利亚、菲律宾、泰国等仆从把更多的雇佣军派到越南南方，并且指使其他走卒，如日本、西德等反动派为美帝国主义侵略越南南方的战争提供战争装备和作战物资。美国远征军接连不断地进行“扫荡”，杀人放火，派遣B52型飞机连续轰炸人口稠密的地区，在越南南方大规模地使用化学毒药和毒气，犯下无比野蛮的罪行。最近，美帝国主义于一九六六年七月一日派遣飞机野蛮地轰炸和扫射边和省新渊地区一所小学和一个人数众多的市集，使六十多人遭到伤亡，其中大部分是小学生。
    美国当局在竭力强化和扩大越南战争，加强对老挝的侵略战争，对柬埔寨的独立和中立进行挑衅和破坏，在印度支那和东南亚制造十分紧张的局势的同时，却又不断地叫嚷什么“和平”、“无条件讨论”等，以欺骗世界舆论。然而，人们看得很清楚，美帝国主义的一切论调，万变不离其宗，唯一的内容是，死赖在越南南方不走，竭力维持它一手扶植起来的傀儡政权，妄图长期分割越南的领土，不承认越南人民拥有解决自己内部事务的权利。越南人民和世界人民已经唾弃了美帝国主义及铁托、甘地夫人、威尔逊式的美国同伙者所玩弄的所谓“寻求和平”的欺骗手段。
    越南南方战场的实际情况表明，美国侵略军增派到越南南方愈多，被歼灭的愈多，失败得愈惨。美国强盗在越南北方的每一次战争“升级”，就更加激起越南南方军民的同仇敌忾，将更加把它们打得焦头烂额。六月三十日，在美国强盗轰炸河内和海防郊区的第二天，越南南方军民就在西贡以北一百多公里的芹黎桥北面，第十三号公路上，全歼美国第一步兵师的一个坦克和装甲车团，击毁坦克和装甲车四十多辆，全歼车上的敌军。七月一日和二日，又在土龙木省芹黎桥西北面十公里的卡茸地区全歼美国第一步兵师一个整营。这个辉煌胜利表明，越南南方军民已经实现了越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会在一九六五年三月二十二日声明中所说的话：“如果美帝国主义者侵犯我们祖国的北方一次，南方的军队和人民决心要两倍、三倍地狠狠回击他们。”芹黎桥以及五月份以来几十次战绩，歼灭和严重消耗敌军十多个营和几十个连，粉碎了好战分子约翰逊所吹嘘的它们在越南南方的军事形势“正在好转”的骗人鬼话，同时也是越南南方军民极其迅速成长的有力证明。
    在越南南方军民节节胜利的同时，我们越南北方的同胞也接连不断地给予敌人以沉重的打击。截至一九六六年七月八日止，已经有一千一百八十二架美国强盗飞机在越南民主共和国领土上被击落，这还不是最后的数字，如果美帝国主义仍然顽固地继续实行它的愚蠢的“升级”的话。
    越南人民以致命的打击惩罚了美国侵略者，用实际行动告诉它们，一切阴谋诡计，一切威胁恫吓手段，决不能使越南民族屈服。美帝国主义休想以轰炸越南北方作为手段来威胁越南南方人民，迫使越南南方军民放下武器，向它们投降。越南南方军民坚决战斗到底，打败美帝国主义及其走狗，一定实现自己的神圣愿望：独立、民主、和平、中立，进而统一祖国。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    在抗美救国的斗争中，越南南方人民得到了社会主义国家的人民、国际工人阶级、亚非拉各国人民以及全世界一切爱好和平的人民无比宝贵和日益强有力的同情和支持。借此机会，请允许我们对热情支持我们的各国人民表示衷心的感谢。
    早在我们越南南方人民充满牺牲和艰苦斗争的最初的日子里，中国人民就和我们站在一起，完全同情和支持我们。毛泽东主席在一九六三年八月二十九日的声明中就指出：“我们中国人民是坚决支持越南南方人民的正义斗争的。我深信，越南南方人民一定能够通过斗争实现解放越南南方的目标，并且为祖国的和平统一作出贡献。”
    最近，中华人民共和国政府一九六六年七月三日发表的声明肯定地指出：“中国从来一贯地、无保留地、尽一切可能从政治上、道义上、物质上并且从其他方面给予越南以支持和援助。现在，由于美帝国主义侵略战争发展到了一个新的更加严重的阶段，使我们的这种支持和援助，更加不受任何约束和限制。我们将根据越南人民的利益，根据越南人民的要求，随时采取我们认为必要的行动。”这是伟大的七亿中国人民共同的声音，这是每一个中国人民的钢铁般的意志。
    几年来，“援越抗美”高潮，正在遍及中国广阔的土地上蓬勃发展。在部队，工厂、企业、人民公社、工地、学校，人人开展竞赛，积极增加生产，为支援越南作出贡献。中国各阶层人民，不分男女老幼，甚至小学生也投身于“援越抗美”运动中。我们每天都收到中国人民大量的热情洋溢的来信，表示了支持越南南方人民抗美救国斗争的决心，随时准备同越南南方人民共存亡。直到目前为止，中国人民已经有成千上万人报名志愿到越南南方去，同越南南方人民并肩战斗。这是中越两国人民战斗团结友谊的光辉表现。
    我们对于中国人民这种最坚决的、最强有力、最有效的支持给予很高的评价。正是这种巨大的支持和其他兄弟国家人民的支持，大大地增强了越南南方人民战斗的潜力，并给越南南方人民带来了巨大的鼓舞。
    在这里，请允许我再一次表达越南南方人民、越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党的深挚谢意。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    目前美帝国主义强化和扩大越南南方战争的行动表明，它们的侵略好战本性决不会改变。所以，越南南方人民取得最后胜利的唯一正确的道路，仍然如越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一九六五年三月二十二日声明所指出的那样，走决战决胜、打败敌人、解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的道路。
    我们越南南方人民坚信，在越南南方人民唯一真正的代表——越南南方民族解放阵线的英明领导下，有全体北方骨肉同胞同心协力的支援，有中国人民以及世界各国人民的同情和支持，具有团结一致的坚决斗争精神的越南南方人民必将取得最后胜利。
    越南必胜！
    美帝必败！
    越中两国人民牢不可破的战斗团结万岁！
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民以及全世界热爱和平和主持正义的人民，在为争取民族独立、民主、和平和社会进步的共同斗争中的战斗团结万岁！
