Shanghai workers on the industrial front have decided to thoroughly implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, resolving to turn factories into big schools for studying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought and to forge an industrial army as proletarian and combat-ready as the People's Liberation Army.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai on the 16th, the cadres and workers on Shanghai's industrial front have felt a deep sense of closeness and great inspiration from Comrade Lin Biao's letter regarding the study and application of Chairman Mao's works on the industrial and transportation front. They say that Comrade Lin Biao's letter is a highly important directive for the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in our country. By following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers will surely reach new heights, greatly promoting the development of our country's revolutionary cause.

In his letter, Comrade Lin Biao points out that our country's 700 million people "need a unified ideology, a revolutionary ideology, a correct ideology, and that is Mao Zedong Thought. With this ideology, we can maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit and have a firm and correct political direction."

These words deeply express the feelings of the Shanghai working class, who have an infinite love, faith, and reverence for Mao Zedong Thought. Through long-term revolutionary and construction practices, Shanghai workers have deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental principle of the revolution. With Mao Zedong Thought, there is everything for the people; without Mao Zedong Thought, there is nothing for the people.

Workers such as Yin Yuehong, a fine-spinning frame operator at the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill, Liu Xunzhi, a maintenance worker, and Wang Xiaoying, a lathe operator at the New China Pen Factory, all agree: Mao Zedong Thought is the great truth of this great era. The People's Liberation Army, following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, has made Chairman Mao's words the highest directive for all its work, forging an invincible revolutionary army and producing outstanding communist warriors like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ou Yanghai, Mai Xiande, and Zhang Chunyu. We, the working class, must also follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, making Mao Zedong Thought the highest directive for all our work, and forging a workforce as proletarian and combat-ready as the People's Liberation Army. In this way, our country will prosper even more, and our contributions to the people of the world will be even greater.

Yang Fuzhen, a model worker in Shanghai for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and a weaver, said: "Comrade Lin Biao's words hit the mark. From my practice, I deeply feel that if one completely and thoroughly listens to Chairman Mao, the loom will completely and thoroughly listen to the person, and one can make greater and greater contributions to the socialist cause." Over the past decade, Yang Fuzhen, under the Party's cultivation and education, has read Chairman Mao's books and listened to Chairman Mao's words, devoting herself wholeheartedly to the revolution. She has grown from an ordinary worker into an advanced warrior of the proletariat, achieving extraordinary results in her ordinary work. Since 1953, she has consistently overfulfilled the state plan every month and has always maintained the honorable titles of advanced producer and five-good worker.

Chen Xinyu, the Party branch secretary of the De Xin Metal Smelting Plant, recalled the plant's journey over the past eight years and found Comrade Lin Biao's letter particularly heartwarming. He said: "This letter is as if it were written about our factory. In 1957, when our factory was just established by merging several handicraft workshops, it was called a 'junk factory.' Since 1958, we have organized workers to study Chairman Mao's works, firmly grasping class struggle as the key link. The workers' spiritual outlook has undergone a profound change, from fearing difficulties and avoiding them to seeking them out and overcoming them. In the three great revolutionary movements, we have achieved victory after victory, turning the 'junk factory' into a Dazhai-style enterprise."

The work of an enterprise is complex and varied. Only by following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions and placing the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work can we ensure that the enterprise advances along the socialist path. Otherwise, we will lose our direction and may even go astray. This is the common experience of many factory cadres in Shanghai. This year, the state-owned Shanghai No. 5 Cotton Textile Mill has consciously organized cadres and workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, overcoming some incorrect thoughts, promoting the thought revolutionization of people, and making the enterprise more prosperous. The responsible person of this factory, after studying Comrade Lin Biao's letter, deeply felt: Whether or not we can place the study of Chairman Mao's works in the first position and maintain a firm and correct political direction is a major issue concerning whether a socialist enterprise gradually advances towards communism or regresses towards capitalism. Only with people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can we uphold the socialist and communist direction and truly run the factory well. In this regard, the PLA is several years ahead of us. Now Comrade Lin Biao has issued a call to us, and we must catch up quickly.

Comrade Lin Biao points out that Mao Zedong Thought is not spontaneously generated by the working people; it must be imparted to workers and peasants through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to change the spiritual outlook of the working people. Shanghai workers believe this is an absolute truth. Wang Shunxiang, an outstanding propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought, deputy chairwoman of the union and women's committee of the New China Pen Factory, and a five-good worker, has a deep understanding of this instruction from Comrade Lin Biao. Wang Shunxiang, who had been a child worker in the old society and suffered greatly, only saw the light of day in the new society. However, it was only after studying Chairman Mao's works that she became enlightened and truly understood why people live and how to live meaningfully. Since then, Wang Shunxiang, with a burning class sentiment and high revolutionary consciousness, has visited over 250 worker households in more than six years, helping many workers solve practical difficulties. She not only studies Chairman Mao's works herself but also uses the great Mao Zedong Thought to promote the revolutionization of workers and their families.

Some enterprise leaders in Shanghai say that the process of imparting Mao Zedong Thought to the worker masses is a serious class struggle. Chen Deming, head of the propaganda department of the political department of the Shanghai Qiu Xin Shipbuilding Factory, says: "Since our factory launched the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in 1958, this serious struggle has never stopped. Various representatives of the bourgeoisie are extremely hostile and fearful of Mao Zedong Thought and extremely hostile and fearful of our workers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Over the past eight years, they have continuously thrown out sticks like 'rough workers cannot study philosophy' to fiercely attack our factory's mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Under the leadership and support of the higher-level Party committee, our factory workers have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and waged a head-on struggle with them, achieving continuous victories. In the struggle against class enemies, we have studied Chairman Mao's works more thoroughly, used them more actively, understood them more deeply, and accelerated the change in people's spiritual outlook.

Many leading cadres on Shanghai's industrial front, after studying Comrade Lin Biao's letter, have come to realize: Socialist enterprises must make the cultivation of revolutionary talents their primary strategic task and turn factories into big schools for studying Mao Zedong Thought. They have expressed their determination to take the lead in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good students of Chairman Mao.

### 上海广大职工学习林彪同志给工业交通战线的信　工厂要办成学习毛泽东思想的大学校　职工要炼成象解放军那样的产业大军

　　上海广大职工学习林彪同志给工业交通战线的信
　　工厂要办成学习毛泽东思想的大学校  职工要炼成象解放军那样的产业大军
    据新华社上海十六日电　上海工业战线的干部和工人，决心认真贯彻执行林彪同志的指示，立志把工厂企业办成毛泽东思想的大学校，培养和造就一支象解放军那样非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的产业大军。
    林彪同志就工业交通战线活学活用毛主席著作写的一封信发表后，上海广大职工感到十分亲切，从中受到极大的鼓舞。他们说，林彪同志这封信，是对我国广大工农兵活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的极其重要的指示。遵照林彪同志的指示去做，必将进一步促进广大工农兵活学活用毛主席著作走向新的高潮，这将大大推动我国革命事业的发展。
    林彪同志在信中指出，我国七亿人口“需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。有了这个思想，才能保持旺盛的革命干劲，才有坚定正确的政治方向。”
    这段话深刻地表达了上海工人阶级对毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情。上海职工从长期革命和建设的实践中深切体会到：毛泽东思想是革命的根本。有了毛泽东思想，才有人民的一切；离开了毛泽东思想，就没有人民的一切。
    国营上海第一棉纺织厂细纱挡车工殷月红，保养工刘训治，新华金笔厂车工汪小英等人一致认为：毛泽东思想是我们这个伟大时代的伟大真理。中国人民解放军按照林彪同志的指示，全军上下把毛主席的话当作各项工作的最高指示，锻炼成为一支战无不胜的革命军队，出现了雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、麦贤得、张春玉这样优秀的共产主义战士；我们工人阶级也一定要按照林彪同志的指示，把毛泽东思想作为各项工作的最高指示，培养和造就象解放军那样的非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的职工队伍。这样，我们的国家就会更加兴旺，我们对世界人民的贡献也就更大了。
    上海活学活用毛主席著作的标兵、织布女工杨富珍说：“林彪同志的话，句句说到我的心坎里。我从实践中深深体会到，人完全彻底听毛主席的话，布机就能完全彻底听人的话，就能为社会主义事业作出越来越大的贡献。”十多年来，杨富珍在党的培养教育下，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，一心一意为革命，从一个普通工人成长为无产阶级的先进战士，在平凡的工作中做出了不平凡的成绩。从一九五三年以来，她月月超额完成国家计划，一直保持着先进生产者和五好工人等光荣称号。
    德新金属冶炼厂的党支部书记陈鑫煜回忆他们厂八年来走过的道路，对林彪同志的信感到特别亲切。他说：这封信就象写到了我们工厂。一九五七年，我们厂刚由一些手工业作坊合并建立起来的时候，被人们称为“垃圾工厂”。一九五八年以来，我们组织职工学习毛主席著作，牢牢抓住阶级斗争这个纲，职工的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，从怕困难、躲困难，到找困难、斗困难，在三大革命运动中取得了节节胜利，把“垃圾工厂”办成了大庆式的企业。
    一个企业的工作千头万绪，只有按照林彪同志的指示，把大学毛主席著作放在各项工作的首位，才能保证企业沿着社会主义的道路前进。否则，就会迷失方向，甚至走入歧途。这是上海不少工厂干部共同的体会。今年以来，国营上海第五棉纺厂领导比较自觉地组织干部和工人活学活用毛主席著作，克服了一些不正确的思想，促进了人的思想革命化，企业越办越兴旺。这家厂的负责人学习了林彪同志的信，深有体会地说：能不能把大学毛主席著作放在第一位，坚持坚定正确的政治方向，是关系到社会主义企业向共产主义逐步前进还是向资本主义倒退的大问题。只有有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，才能坚持社会主义、共产主义的方向，才能真正办好工厂。在这方面，解放军比我们早走了好几年。现在林彪同志向我们发出了号召，我们要急起直追。
    林彪同志指出，毛泽东思想并不是劳动人民自发产生的，必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌。上海职工认为，这是千真万确的真理。毛泽东思想的优秀宣传员、新华金笔厂工会副主席兼女工委员、五好工人王顺香，对林彪同志的这个指示有深切的体会。王顺香在旧社会做过童工，吃尽了苦，在新社会才重见天日。可是，只是在学习了毛主席著作以后，她才心明眼亮，真正懂得了人为什么活着，怎样活着才有意义。从此，王顺香以火热的阶级感情和高度的革命自觉，在六年多时间内，先后访问了二百五十多户职工家庭，帮助许多职工解决了一些实际困难。她不但自己学习毛主席著作，而且用伟大的毛泽东思想去促进职工和职工家庭的革命化。
    上海有些企业的领导干部说，向职工群众灌输毛泽东思想过程，是一场严重的阶级斗争的过程。中共上海求新造船厂政治部宣传部部长陈德明说：我们厂从一九五八年开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动以来，这一场严重的斗争从来没有间断过。形形色色的资产阶级代表人物，十分仇视和害怕毛泽东思想，十分仇视和害怕我们职工活学活用毛主席著作。八年来，他们接连抛出了“大老粗不能学哲学”等等棍子，拚命攻击我们厂活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。我们厂职工在上级党委的领导和支持下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同他们展开了针锋相对的斗争，连连取得了胜利。在同阶级敌人的斗争中，我们对毛主席著作学得更透，用得更活，领会更深，加速改变了人的精神面貌。
    上海工业战线许多领导干部学了林彪同志的信认识到：社会主义企业要把造就革命化的人材当作首要的战略任务，要把工厂企业办成学习毛泽东思想的大学校。他们表示，决心在群众性的活学活用毛主席著作的革命运动中，带头读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好学生。
