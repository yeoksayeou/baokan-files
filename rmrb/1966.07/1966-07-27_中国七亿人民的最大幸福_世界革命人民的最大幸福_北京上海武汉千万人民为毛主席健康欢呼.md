The news that our most beloved leader Chairman Mao swam the Yangtze River against the wind and waves has greatly inspired the people of the capital. People rushed to tell each other: Chairman Mao is so healthy and full of energy, just like ten years ago, he swam in the surging and rapid currents of the Yangtze River, "unfazed by wind and waves, as if strolling in a courtyard." This is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people and also the greatest happiness for the revolutionary people of the world. Many people, upon seeing the photos of Chairman Mao looking radiant in the newspaper, could not help but sing "The East Is Red" and recite Chairman Mao's poems, "Water Melody (Swimming)," over and over again, and repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years!" They sincerely wished Chairman Mao eternal life. Many people also held discussions, wrote big-character posters, and wrote letters to the newspaper to express their boundless love for the great leader.

The people of the capital, who are deeply engaged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They not only want to swim and train in rivers, lakes, and seas but also want to follow Chairman Mao in advancing through the storms and waves of class struggle and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Students from Class 603 of the Engineering Physics Department at Tsinghua University immediately wrote a letter of respect to Chairman Mao upon hearing the news. The letter read: Chairman Mao led us to overthrow the three great mountains, carry out socialist revolution and construction, overcome countless obstacles, cross mountains and rivers, sail against the wind and waves, and achieve one victory after another. Even with countless words, we cannot express our boundless love, admiration, and reverence for Chairman Mao.

Students from Class 3 of the Chinese Department, Year 3, at Beijing Normal University expressed their determination to study Mao Zedong Thought more diligently, follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, broaden their horizons, sail against the wind and waves, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Not long ago, the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 4 Middle School, who had expressed their enthusiastic support for the abolition of the old examination system to Chairman Mao, vowed to uphold the revolutionary spirit of fearing neither heaven nor earth and wage a resolute struggle against class enemies in the storms and waves of the Cultural Revolution.

The news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River reached the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Ulan Muqi Performing Troupe, which was performing in the capital. Actors from five ethnic groups—Mongolian, Han, Daur, Ewenki, and Korean—were filled with passion and wrote a song praising the beloved leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao:

	Red ribbons dance swiftly,
	Songs of praise resound,
	We sing of you, Chairman Mao,
	Our red sun!
	Long live Chairman Mao,
	Long live the Communist Party,
	Generations to come will sing,
	Wishing you eternal life!

	Yesterday evening and tonight, as soon as they mentioned the news of the great leader Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River on stage, the entire audience erupted in thunderous applause, fully expressing the deep love and admiration of the broad masses of people for the great leader Chairman Mao.

From the news agency in Shanghai, July 26th: The news of the great leader Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River in Wuhan spread to Shanghai, and a million workers in Shanghai unanimously cheered for Chairman Mao's health and wished him eternal life, determined to follow Chairman Mao forever in the storms and waves.

Yesterday morning, when the masses of workers heard the news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River on the radio, they rushed to tell each other, filled with joy and inspiration. By today, nearly a million copies of the newspaper reporting Chairman Mao's swimming of the Yangtze River have been sold in Shanghai.

The news reached the Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill, which Chairman Mao had inspected in 1957, and the workers and revolutionary cadres engaged in the Cultural Revolution were greatly inspired.

They said, in 1957, our beloved leader Chairman Mao personally came to see our big-character posters, giving us boundless strength and immense inspiration. Now, we must hold high the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, forever following Chairman Mao and becoming steadfast and thorough revolutionaries.

The news reached the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant, where Chairman Mao had celebrated "May Day" with the workers in 1961. The excellent worker and Communist Youth League cadre Wang Rongzhang said: "From the bottom of my heart, I shout: Long live Chairman Mao! This is the boundless care and encouragement of Chairman Mao for our younger generation! We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the three great revolutionary movements, face the wind and rain, gain experience, and temper ourselves in the storms and waves!"

In the advanced units like the Dede New Metal Smelting Plant and Shanghai Weihai Iron Works, in the Shanghai No. 9 Cotton Mill, Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant, and the Quxin Shipyard, which has been promoting the study of Chairman Mao's works for eight years, the workers, upon hearing the news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River, were moved and held discussions, posted big red notices, expressing their boundless love, faith, and admiration for the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people—Chairman Mao.

From the news agency in Wuhan, July 26th: Chairman Mao's swimming of the Yangtze River on July 16th has greatly inspired the people of Wuhan.

After the 11th Wuhan Cross-Yangtze Swimming Competition ended, participants and spectators returned to their workplaces or homes, and the first thing they did was to tell everyone they met: I saw Chairman Mao today, what happiness! Chairman Mao is very healthy! "Long live Chairman Mao" echoed through the factories, schools, and streets. Many people gathered to discuss, write resolutions, and write to the newspaper, expressing their boundless love, admiration, and reverence for the great leader Chairman Mao. They vowed to follow Chairman Mao forever.

Soldiers from a certain unit of the PLA stationed in Wuhan, Ai Duntan, Zhao Mingfu, Wang Haishi, and Zhang Deli, swam the Yangtze River with the great leader Chairman Mao this time. They felt boundless happiness. They unanimously expressed that in the future, they would better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, temper themselves in the storms and waves of class struggle, train their combat skills, and defend the Party Central Committee, Mao Zedong Thought, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the socialist mountains and rivers.

Wu Han Heavy Machinery Factory's excellent worker Cai Chunsheng saw Chairman Mao with his own eyes while swimming. When he heard Chairman Mao shout "Long live the people," he was so moved that he shed tears. He said, "No matter how stormy the journey ahead, with Chairman Mao by our side, we have boundless strength. We dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire."

In 1961, Wu Han Normal University student Yuan Xianliang, who had accompanied Chairman Mao to swim across the Yangtze River, was at the forefront this time. When he saw Chairman Mao, he was so excited that he could not speak for a long time. He said, "We must advance bravely on the ten-thousand-li navigation route across the Yangtze River opened by Chairman Mao; we must also advance bravely in the three great revolutionary movements, following the direction indicated by Chairman Mao."

Students Liu Jun and Wang Shengli from Wuhan No. 14 Middle School, who participated in the cross-Yangtze swimming, wrote in the Wuhan Evening News: "Chairman Mao, rest assured, we, the youth of this generation, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely shoulder the responsibility of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution."
