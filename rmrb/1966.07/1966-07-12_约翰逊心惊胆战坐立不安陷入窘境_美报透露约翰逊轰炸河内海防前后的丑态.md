Johnson Trembles with Fear, Unable to Sit Still, in a Predicament
U.S. Media Reveals Johnson's Cowardly Behavior Before and After Bombing Hanoi and Haiphong

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on July 11, New York: Recent reports from U.S. newspapers and news agencies have revealed Johnson's cowardly behavior before and after deciding to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong, fully exposing the desperate plight of U.S. imperialism.

	United Press International correspondent Merriam Smith wrote on July 8 that before deciding to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong, Johnson "became a bit like an animal in a cage, pacing back and forth, frequently circling around this issue."

	Smith also wrote: "Johnson was very worried about the possibility of leaks beforehand, fearing that premature disclosure or broadcasting of his plans would increase U.S. losses or provoke the North Vietnamese to..."

	On the same day, an article in the U.S. magazine *Time* revealed that during the U.S. bandit planes' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong on June 29, "McNamara's office was lit up all night."

	At three in the morning, "in the White House, in the second-floor room where Lyndon Johnson sleeps, a bedside lamp was on, and the president was quietly talking to the situation room in the basement, repeatedly inquiring about the 'operational situation' in the Far East."

	This article indicates that Johnson eagerly wanted to reassure domestic critics and foreign skeptics once again that the United States is determined to fulfill its commitments to Vietnam. He was also anxious to present some concrete evidence of victory before the November congressional elections.

　　约翰逊心惊胆战坐立不安陷入窘境
　　美报透露约翰逊轰炸河内海防前后的丑态
    据新华社十一日讯　纽约消息：美国报刊和通讯社最近透露了约翰逊在决定轰炸河内、海防前后心惊胆战坐立不安的丑态，充分暴露了美帝国主义狗急跳墙的一副窘相。
    合众国际社记者梅里曼·史密斯八日写道，在决定轰炸河内、海防以前的长时间里，约翰逊“变得有点象关在笼子中的动物，不时走动，经常环绕着这个问题说话”。
    史密斯还写道：“约翰逊对于可能的事先泄露十分担心，害怕过早地公布或广播他的计划会使美国的损失增加，或促使北越人进行……反击。”
    同一天，美国《时代》周刊的一篇文章透露，在美国强盗飞机六月二十九日轰炸河内、海防期间，“麦克纳马拉的办公室中全夜灯火通明。”
    清晨三点钟，“在白宫，林登·约翰逊睡觉的二楼的房间里，一盏床边的灯亮着，总统低声地在同西厢地下室里的情况室在说话”，一再了解远东的“作战情况”。
    这篇文章表明，约翰逊切望要向国内的批评者和国外的怀疑者再次表明，美国决心履行它对越南的承诺。他还急于要在十一月举行国会选举之前拿出某种确实的胜利的证据。
