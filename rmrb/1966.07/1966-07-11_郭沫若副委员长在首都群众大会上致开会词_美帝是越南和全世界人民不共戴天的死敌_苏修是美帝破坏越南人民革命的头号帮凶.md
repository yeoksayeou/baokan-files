The capital's people from various circles condemn U.S. imperialism's bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, and support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The meeting now begins.

Since June 29, U.S. imperialism has brazenly and continuously bombed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's capital Hanoi and its second-largest city Haiphong, sparking outrage and condemnation from peace-loving countries and people who uphold justice around the world. Our government has already issued a solemn statement on July 3. At this solemn meeting today, first of all, let me, on behalf of all the people of China, express our full support for our government's statement, strongly condemn U.S. imperialism's heinous and aggressive war actions, reaffirm our firm resolve to aid Vietnam and fight the U.S., and pay the highest respect to the Vietnamese people who are fighting on the frontlines against U.S. aggression.

U.S. imperialism has pushed the Vietnam War to a new and more serious stage in its madness, attempting to use air strikes to blackmail and force a "negotiated settlement." However, the military and civilians of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have struck back hard at the U.S. air pirates. The armed forces in South Vietnam and their compatriots in the North have united in their hatred of the enemy, punishing the U.S. invaders day after day. Let our meeting extend warm congratulations to our heroic Vietnamese brothers and sisters, and wish them more and greater victories.

The Johnson administration's bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, and its "bomb to negotiate" scheme, have fully exposed the vicious face of U.S. imperialism's escalating aggression, and once again revealed the traitorous nature of the Soviet revisionist leadership in serving U.S. imperialism's negotiation plot and betraying the Vietnamese people. U.S. imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Vietnamese people, and the Soviet revisionist leadership is the chief accomplice in U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle.

Chairman Mao has told us: "To create disorder, fail, create disorder again, fail again, until they perish—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." U.S. imperialism's new war adventure in Vietnam is merely a desperate struggle, a sign of weakness. As the war of aggression escalates and the negotiation plot fails, U.S. imperialism will inevitably approach its grave.

The Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation is a great people's war. It has shown, and will continue to show, all oppressed nations and peoples that the decisive factor in war is people, not things. Revolutionary masses are the true iron wall. United people are the strongest fighting fortress. Only by believing in the power of the people, relying on the power of the people, strengthening unity, and persisting in the struggle, can one achieve liberation.

Fight on, heroic Vietnamese people! Seven hundred million Chinese people stand with you, and all revolutionary people around the world stand with you, firmly supporting your just struggle until all U.S. aggressors are completely, thoroughly, and cleanly driven out of Vietnam, and you achieve the great cause of liberating the South and unifying the country. The Vietnamese people will surely win! U.S. imperialism will surely fail!

    郭沫若副委员长在首都群众大会上致开会词
　　美帝是越南和全世界人民不共戴天的死敌  苏修是美帝破坏越南人民革命的头号帮凶
    首都各界人民谴责美帝轰炸河内、海防，支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会现在开始。
    六月二十九日以来，美帝国主义悍然连续轰炸越南民主共和国的首都河内和第二大城市海防，激起了世界上爱好和平的国家和主持正义的人们的愤怒声讨。我国政府已经在七月三日发表了严正的声明。在今天这个庄严的大会上，首先，让我以全中国人民的名义，表示完全拥护我国政府的声明，最强烈地谴责美帝国主义这种罪恶滔天的侵略和战争行动，重申我们援越抗美的坚强意志，并向战斗在反美斗争最前线的越南人民表示崇高的敬意。
    美帝国主义疯狂地把侵越战争推到一个新的更严重的阶段，妄图用空袭讹诈逼出一个“和谈”的局面来。但是，越南民主共和国的军民狠狠地打击了美国空中强盗。越南南方武装力量和北方同胞同仇敌忾，连日严惩了美国侵略者。让我们的大会向英勇的越南兄弟热烈祝贺，预祝他们取得更多更大的胜利。
    约翰逊政府轰炸河内、海防和它“以炸迫和”的罪恶勾当，完全暴露了美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的凶恶面目，也再一次暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团为美帝国主义的和谈阴谋效劳，出卖越南人民的叛徒面目。美帝国主义是越南人民不共戴天的死敌，苏联修正主义领导集团就是美帝国主义破坏越南人民革命斗争的头号帮凶。
    毛主席告诉我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美帝国主义在越南的新的战争冒险，只是一种垂死挣扎，是虚弱的表现。侵略战争不断升级，“和谈”阴谋不断破产，美帝国主义就必然逐渐走近坟墓。
    越南人民的抗美救国战争，是一场伟大的人民战争。它向一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民表明，并将进一步表明：决定战争胜负的因素是人、不是物。革命的群众是真正的铜墙铁壁。团结起来的人民是最坚固的战斗堡垒。只有相信人民群众的力量，依靠人民群众的力量，加强团结，坚持斗争，才是争取解放的正确道路。
    战斗吧，英雄的越南人民！七亿中国人民同你们站在一起，全世界的革命人民同你们站在一起，坚决支持你们的正义斗争，直到把美国侵略者全部、彻底、干净地赶出越南，实现你们解放南方、统一祖国的大业。越南人民必胜！美帝国主义必败！
    同志们，朋友们：
    今天的大会是由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国越南友好协会等十三个团体联合主办的。出席我们大会的，有党和国家领导人，有各民主党派的领导人，还有有关团体的负责人。应邀参加我们大会的，有越南民主共和国驻我国陈子平大使、越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团陈文成团长和其他在京的越南的同志们，让我们向他们表示最热烈的欢迎。参加大会的，还有出席亚非作家紧急会议的各国代表以及在北京的各国朋友们，让我们向他们表示感谢和热烈欢迎。
