	The radiance of Chairman Mao
	(Catholic Song of the Evenki People)

	The sea is not as wide as our grasslands,
	Our grasslands are wider than the sea!
	The stars in the sky are not as numerous as our flocks,
	Our flocks are more numerous than the stars in the sky!
	The golden sunflower is not as beautiful as our lives,
	Our lives are more beautiful than the sunflower!
	The mountains that touch the clouds are not as high as the Party's kindness,
	The Party's kindness is higher than the mountains!
	The sun is not as warm as Chairman Mao's radiance,
	Chairman Mao's radiance is warmer than the sun!

    毛主席的光辉
    （鄂温克族民歌）宽不过那蓝色的大海，我们的草原比大海还宽哩！多不过那天上的星星，我们的羊群比天上的星星还多
  哩！美不过那金色的那日伦，＊我们的生活比那日伦还美哩！高不过那入云的山峰，共产党的恩情比山峰还高哩！暖不过那火热的太阳，毛主席的光辉比太阳还暖哩！
    ＊那日伦，即葵花
