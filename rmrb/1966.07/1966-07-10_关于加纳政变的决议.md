We, the representatives of Asian and African writers who participated in the emergency conference of Asian and African writers held in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, from June 27 to July 9, 1966, to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, have studied the serious situation created by the military coup in Ghana.

After hearing the report by the representative of the Ghana Writers' Association on the situation in Ghana, we strongly condemn the military coup in Ghana and express our ardent support for the government of the Convention People's Party led by President Kwame Nkrumah and the people of Ghana who are now under military rule.

On February 24, 1966, the United States, in collusion with West Germany and Britain, orchestrated a military coup in Ghana. As a result, 2,500 men and women were killed, and 3,000 were injured. Six thousand party workers and members, as well as all legislators, were imprisoned. The constitution was temporarily suspended, and the parliament was dissolved. The Convention People's Party and all other progressive organizations were banned.

The coup was not caused by widespread dissatisfaction among the Ghanaian people with the government of the Convention People's Party led by President Nkrumah, nor was it due to economic difficulties as claimed by the so-called National Liberation Council. If Ghana faced economic difficulties, the chairman of the so-called National Liberation Council, Ankrah, would have no reason to raise his own and the other members' salaries, as this implies an increase in income.

The developments after the coup clearly prove that the purpose of the coup was to weaken Asian-African solidarity and strengthen the imperialist camp.

All experts from socialist countries who were working in Ghana's universities and industrial construction projects were expelled. Regrettably, some of these experts were beaten. A few days later, experts from the United States, Britain, and West Germany hurriedly arrived in Ghana.

The so-called National Liberation Council is not the new government of Ghana. It is merely a group of military and police adventurers who are destroying and undermining the economic, political, and social achievements of the Ghanaian people. In this wicked deed, they are driven by the neo-colonialists and their agents, who use force to oppress the Ghanaian people.

We, the representatives of Asian and African writers who participated in the emergency conference to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, after thoroughly studying the situation in Ghana, unanimously adopted the following resolution:

	- To strongly condemn the military coup in Ghana.
	- To express support for the Ghanaian people in their struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism led by the United States.

We strongly condemn the reactionary coup that sent all African nationalists who were residing in Ghana as political refugees to Fernando Po and the so-called Portuguese Guinea. This criminal act violates all fundamental principles of human rights and human dignity, and all fundamental principles of Asian-African solidarity.

We call on progressive international organizations to take steps to ensure the safety of these brave freedom fighters.

The conference is convinced that the Ghanaian people will surely win the final victory.

### 关于加纳政变的决议

    关于加纳政变的决议
    我们参加一九六六年六月二十七日至七月九日在中华人民共和国首都北京举行的支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的亚非作家紧急会议的亚非国家作家的代表，研究了加纳军事政变所造成的严重局势。
    在听取了加纳作家协会的代表所作的关于加纳形势的报告后，我们以极大的愤怒谴责加纳的军事政变，并且表示热烈支持以克瓦米·恩克鲁玛总统为首的人民大会党政府和现在处于军事统治压迫下的加纳人民。
    一九六六年二月二十四日，美国勾结西德和英国在加纳策动了一次军事政变。这次政变的结果，有二千五百名男女死亡，三千人受伤。六千名党的工作人员和党员、以及所有的议员被监禁。宪法被暂时停止执行，议会被解散。人民大会党和所有其他的进步组织均遭取缔。
    政变不是因为加纳人民对以恩克鲁玛总统为首的人民大会党政府普遍不满而引起的，也不是象所谓全国解放委员会所宣称的那样是经济困难而引起的。如果加纳有经济困难，所谓的全国解放委员会主席安卡拉就没有理由替自己和该委员会的其他成员提级了，因为提级意味着增加薪金。
    政变后的事态不容置疑地证明了政变的目的在于削弱亚非团结和加强帝国主义阵营。
    在加纳各大学中的和从事工业建设的社会主义国家的所有专家都被驱逐了。遗憾的是其中有些专家遭到毒打。几天以后，美国、英国和西德的专家匆忙地来到了加纳。
    所谓全国解放委员会并不是加纳的新政府。它只不过是一个正在摧毁和挫败加纳人民所取得的经济、政治和社会成就的军事和警察冒险家集团。在这个穷凶极恶的勾当中，他们受到新殖民主义者及其代理人的推动，这些人使用武力压迫加纳人民。
    我们参加支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的亚非作家紧急会议的亚非作家代表，在对加纳局势进行了全面研究后，一致通过了下列决议：
    ——严厉谴责加纳的军事政变。
    ——表示支持加纳人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义、殖民主义和新殖民主义的斗争。
    我们大力谴责在反动政变时把作为政治避难者而居住在加纳的所有非洲民族主义者送到费尔南多·波和所谓的葡属几内亚。这一罪恶行为违反人权和人类尊严的一切根本原则，违反亚非团结的一切根本原则。
    我们呼吁进步国际组织采取步骤，保证这些勇敢的自由战士的安全。
    会议深信加纳人民一定能赢得最后胜利。
