Uganda's representative Ben Musa today said at the plenary session of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers that the Vietnamese people's war against U.S. imperialist aggression is a just people's war, and the people of Uganda will take resolute action to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people. In his speech, he pointed out that it was wise, timely, and correct to hold this conference in Beijing, the capital of the revolutionary people of China. Beijing is the only suitable place. He said that the revolutionary people of China, under the effective, correct, and inspiring leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, stand at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and all reactionary forces in the world.

Ben Musa condemned the split activities of the Soviet revisionists and expressed that the Ugandan delegation fully supports all the steps taken by the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers against the illegal Cairo split conference. He said, "We Asian and African writers thank and support the revolutionaries of great leader Chairman Mao in their struggle against Soviet modern revisionism—the great danger in our anti-imperialist cause."

He expressed his support for holding the Third Conference of Asian and African Writers in Beijing.
