Here is the Miracle of the World Created by Mao Zedong Thought
– Foreign Friends Attending the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference Visit Shashiya Village

Foreign writers attending the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference braved the rain on the 11th to visit Shashiya Village in Yuxian County, Hebei Province, to see the "Living Qu Yuan of the Modern Era" who have created astonishing achievements. During the visit, many foreign friends expressed their heartfelt praise. They said: Here, we see how Mao Zedong Thought has been put into practice. The facts have proven that once the great Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it can change the heavens and the earth, creating all miracles of the world.

The famous "Living Qu Yuan of the Modern Era" – the members of Shashiya Village, under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, with the revolutionary spirit of "striving for progress and self-reliance" and the indomitable will of "moving mountains like Qu Yuan," have worked tirelessly, diligently, and ingeniously for over a decade. They have transformed a poor mountain village, where "the soil is like pearls and the water is like oil, with rocks everywhere," into a socialist new countryside with terraced fields and fruit trees covering the mountains. They have become a model for actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and changing the natural landscape.

The foreign friends listened attentively to the introduction by Zhang Guishun, the Party branch secretary of Shashiya Village, about the tremendous changes in Shashiya before and after liberation. Before liberation, in this poor mountain village where there was only rock and no land, and where water and grain were scarce, out of 78 households, 67 households ate chaff and wild vegetables all year round, and 10 households had "half a year of chaff and wild vegetables and half a year of grain." The entire village had 13 households that begged for food all year round. After liberation, the people of Shashiya organized themselves, followed Chairman Mao's teachings, and fought against the heavens and the earth. They turned the mountains of rocks into terraced fields and turned the barren mountains into green forests. Since 1957, the people of Shashiya have been able to sell surplus grain to the state, totaling over 410,000 catties in recent years. Zhang Guishun told the foreign friends: The people of Shashiya believe in this saying: "To listen to words, listen to Chairman Mao's words; to talk about revolution, no difficulty is feared." This is the source of the endless strength of the people of Shashiya.

The foreign friends, with great interest, held hands with the villagers and walked up the muddy and slippery mountain paths to the high northern slope. The guests listened to Zhang Guishun's narration and followed his gestures to look around. They saw that in the midst of the surrounding mountains, layer upon layer of level terraced fields were filled with thriving corn; the green "Youth Forest" and "Women's Forest" stretched endlessly; among the trees, the rows of villagers' houses were visible, creating a scene of lush greenery, mountains of flowers and fruits, and a prosperous landscape. Seeing how Mao Zedong Thought has been transformed into a great material force here, they repeatedly exclaimed and praised: "Too great!" "Amazing!" "Wonderful!" The representative from Cameroon, Fei Ze, told Li Shuzhen, one of the 31 "Iron Girls" of Shashiya and the deputy village head, "Mao Zedong's saying that the human factor is the first is completely correct. Today, I have seen how Mao Zedong Thought is being practiced here. Not only should you study Chairman Mao's works, but we should also learn from them." The representative from Somalia, Hersi, said: "The tremendous changes in Shashiya and the tremendous changes in all of China are the great victory of Mao Zedong's self-reliance thought."

Zhang Guishun led the foreign friends to a water reservoir and introduced one of the many extraordinary achievements created by the people of Shashiya. In the past, in this mountain village where water was as precious as oil, people had to go five miles away to fetch water. To find water sources, they dug many wells on the rocky mountains but never saw a drop of water. Finally, they dug this reservoir on the rocky mountain, using five whole years, relying on hammering and chiseling, with over 13,000 labor units, to complete it. Last year, they built a mountain-crossing water pipe to bring water from behind the mountain into this reservoir, thus basically solving the drinking water problem for the entire village and also having some water for irrigation. This is not an ordinary reservoir; it represents the will, thoughts, and style of the people. The representative from Pakistan, Ishfaq Ahmad Khan, picked up a stone and said, "I will take this stone back to tell my countrymen how you fought against nature. Nature has been defeated by you, and you have conquered it."

The foreign friends came to a cornfield where a stone monument stood with the inscription: "Ten thousand miles and a thousand loads for one mu of land, creating high yields on green stone slabs." Zhang Guishun pointed to the monument and told the guests another miraculous story. The young people of Shashiya, to expand the cultivated land area, carried soil from five miles away and spread it on large areas of green stone slabs, creating one mu of good land. They traveled a total of ten thousand miles and carried a thousand loads of soil, and also created a high-yield record. This monument is a shining symbol of the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Many foreign friends took photos here to commemorate the occasion. The representative from Angola, Dakru, exclaimed, "You are truly iron men," "You are creating a new world." He said, "Here, we have seen the brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Your experience has global significance."

On the way down the mountain, the foreign friends were excited and discussed enthusiastically. A representative from Sudan told an old villager, Yan Dechun, "Your achievements show the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. You study Chairman Mao's works, and we are also studying Chairman Mao's works. You love Chairman Mao so much, and we also love Chairman Mao very much. Chairman Mao is a person we all respect." The representative from the Philippines, Hernandez, told a young villager, "You have achieved such great results because you have the leadership of Mao Zedong. The Chinese people have such an enlightened leader, which is your happiness. Mao Zedong is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also the leader of all the people of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for the Chinese people and all revolutionary people of the world." The poor and lower-middle-class peasant representative, Li Yongfa, told the Indonesian representative, Weisbi, "We listened to Chairman Mao's words, fearing neither difficulties nor poverty, fighting against the heavens and the earth, and finally changed the face of the world." Weisbi said, "Seeing your present, we are full of confidence in the future of Indonesia. We must learn well from the experience of the Chinese revolution and construction."

At noon, more than 50 households of villagers enthusiastically invited the foreign friends to their homes. They had lunch together, took photos, exchanged gifts, and had cordial conversations about the fighting friendship and the common struggle against imperialism between the Chinese people and the people of Asia and Africa.

The delegation from South Vietnam visited the home of Wang Zhenkui. The delegation leader, Chen Tingyun, repeatedly said, "You have created a great cause that changes the world, and we are very happy. We will definitely bring back your self-reliant spirit to South Vietnam to inspire the South Vietnamese people to better overcome difficulties and fight." Wang Zhenkui said, "We will definitely support the struggle of the Vietnamese people and support the revolution of the people of the world. Please remember, South Vietnamese comrades: We will support you to fight to the end with all our strength." Chen Tingyun was very moved and gave Wang Zhenkui's family his famous work, "Living Like Him," and a badge of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

At the home of Zhang Guishun, the Party branch secretary, the Indian friend Sahota was so excited and moved that as soon as he sat on the kang (traditional heated bed), he said, "Too great, too good! These astonishing achievements, if not seen with one's own eyes, are truly unimaginable. Without Chairman Mao's teachings, it would be impossible to achieve these results." When he heard that the local people are currently in the midst of a wave of studying Chairman Mao's works, he tightly clenched his fist and said with force, "This is the source of the boundless power of the Chinese people!" He said, "Chairman Mao's works come from practice and are put into practice. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest stage of the development of Marxism-Leninism." When Sahota talked about his compatriots still suffering, Zhang Guishun firmly said, "We will not forget the oppressed people of the world. We must support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries." Sahota looked at this ordinary Chinese peasant in amazement and said, "I never imagined that Mao Zedong Thought had raised the awareness of the Chinese people to such a height!"

One of the "Iron Men," Zhou Fenglin, had a very cordial and harmonious conversation with the Syrian representatives, Zadat Rikaibi and Salamah Ubaid. Zhou Fenglin said: The people of Shashiya are determined to struggle for supporting the world revolution. The guests were very moved, and Rikaibi excitedly said, "The Chinese peasants' thoughts are so broad, which is the result of Mao Zedong Thought's guidance. Today's visit has made me see that Mao Zedong Thought has been grasped by the revolutionary peasants of China, producing great power."

Time passed quickly, and the guests had to say goodbye. Each host family presented the guests with walnuts, red dates, and other local products. They bid farewell to the foreign friends with pure and sincere feelings, using the most beautiful language. The guests also bid farewell to the villagers with reluctant hearts, shaking hands warmly and embracing each other.

After the car started, the Asian-African writers, with excited hearts, repeatedly waved goodbye to the villagers.

    这里是毛泽东思想创造的人间奇迹
    ——出席亚非作家紧急会议的各国朋友访问沙石峪大队
    出席亚非作家紧急会议的各国作家，十一日冒着大雨到河北省遵化县岳各庄公社沙石峪大队，访问了创造惊天动地业绩的“当代活愚公”。在参观当中，许多外国朋友从内心深处发出了热情的赞颂。他们说：在这里，我们看到了毛泽东思想是怎样得到了实践。事实证明，伟大的毛泽东思想一旦被人民群众所掌握，就能改天换地，创造一切人间奇迹。
    闻名全国的“当代活愚公”——沙石峪大队的社员们，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，以“奋发图强、自力更生”的革命精神和“愚公移山”的坚强毅力，穷干、苦干、巧干十多年，把一个“土如珍珠水如油，满山遍野大石头”的穷山村，建设成一个梯田层层，果树满山的社会主义新农村，成为活学活用毛主席著作、改变自然面貌的突出典型。
    各国朋友们怀着激动的心情听取了沙石峪大队党支部书记张贵顺关于沙石峪解放前后巨大变化的介绍。解放前，在这个光有石头没有地、缺水更缺粮的穷山村里，七十八户人家就有六十七户常年吃糠咽菜，有十户“半年糠菜半年粮”，全村有十三户常年讨饭。解放后，沙石峪人组织起来，遵循毛主席的教导，战天斗地，硬是把一座座石山削成梯田，把荒山变成绿林。从一九五七年开始，沙石峪人能够向国家交售余粮了，几年来共交售余粮四十一万多斤。张贵顺对各国朋友说：沙石峪人相信这样一句话：“听话要听毛主席的话，要说干革命，什么困难也不怕。”这就是沙石峪人无穷无尽力量的源泉。
    各国朋友怀着浓厚的兴趣，和社员们手搀着手，踏着泥泞、溜滑的山路，登上高耸的北山坡。客人们听着张贵顺的讲述，顺着他的手势四面眺望。只见在群山环抱之中，一层层平整的梯田里，生长着茁壮的玉米；碧绿的“青年林”、“妇女林”一片连着一片；林荫之中，隐现着社员们成排的房舍，真是满目青翠，满山花果，一派欣欣向荣的大好景色。看到毛泽东思想怎样在这里变成巨大的物质力量，他们都不断地惊叹和称赞：“太伟大了！”“真了不起！”“太精采了！”喀麦隆代表费则对沙石峪有名的三十一名“铁姑娘”之一、副大队长李述珍说：“毛泽东主席说人的因素第一，是完全正确的。我今天看到了毛泽东思想是怎样在这里得到实践的。不但你们应该学习毛主席著作，我们也应该学习。”索马里代表赫尔西说：“沙石峪面貌的巨大改变，整个中国面貌的巨大改变，是毛泽东的自力更生思想的伟大胜利。”
    张贵顺领着各国朋友来到一个蓄水池前面，介绍了沙石峪人创造的许多不平凡业绩中的一个。过去，在这个饮水贵如油的山村里，人们要到五里以外的地方去挑水吃。为了寻找水源，他们在石山上打过许多井，都没见过一滴水，最后他们在这座石山上，用了整整五年的时间，全凭着一锤锤、一凿凿，用工一万三千多个，才挖成了这个蓄水池。去年，他们又修了一条翻山引水管道，从山后把水引进这个蓄水池，从此，基本上解决了全村的饮水问题，还可有一部分用于灌溉。这不是一个普通的蓄水池，它代表着人们的意志，人们的思想，人们的风格。巴基斯坦代表伊什法克·艾哈迈德·汗拾起一块石头，他说：“我要把这块石头带回去，告诉我国人民，你们是怎样同自然作斗争的。自然界被你们打败了，你们把它征服了。”
    各国朋友来到一片玉米地边，这里竖着一座石碑，上面刻着：“万里千担一亩田，青石板上创高产。”张贵顺指着石碑，向客人们讲述了另一个奇迹般的故事。沙石峪的青年们，为了扩大耕地面积，从五里路以外搬来泥土，铺在大片青石板上，造成了一亩良田，总计往返万里路，挑土一千担，而且创造了高产纪录。这块石碑，是毛泽东思想胜利的光辉标志，许多外国朋友在这里摄影留念。安哥拉代表达克鲁斯赞叹说：“你们真是铁人”，“你们是在创造新世界”。他说：“在这里，我们看到了毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。你们的经验具有世界意义。”
    下山的路上，各国朋友心情激动，议论纷纷。一位苏丹代表对老社员阎德春说：“你们的成就显示了毛泽东思想的胜利。你们学习毛主席著作，我们也在学习毛主席著作。你们这样热爱毛主席，我们也十分热爱毛主席。毛主席是我们共同敬爱的人。”菲律宾代表埃尔南德斯对一位青年社员说：“你们取得这样大的成就，是因为有毛泽东主席的领导。中国人民有毛泽东这样英明的领袖，是你们的幸福。毛泽东不仅是中国人民的领袖，而且是全世界人民的领袖。毛泽东思想是中国人民和全世界革命人民的灯塔。”大队贫农、下中农协会主席李永发对印度尼西亚代表维斯比说：“我们听了毛主席的话，不怕难，不怕穷，与天斗，与地斗，终于改变了面貌。”维斯比说：“看到你们的今天，使我们对印度尼西亚的未来充满了信心。我们要很好地学习中国革命和建设的经验。”
    中午，有五十多户社员热情邀请各国朋友到自己家里去作客。他们共进午餐，合影留念，互赠礼品，亲切地交谈中国人民同亚非各国人民的战斗友谊和团结反帝的共同斗争。
    越南南方代表团在社员王振奎家里作客。代表团团长陈庭云一再说：“你们创造出翻天覆地的伟大事业，我们太高兴了。我们一定把你们这种自力更生的精神带回越南南方，鼓舞南方人民去更好地战胜困难，进行斗争。”王振奎说：“我们一定坚决支援越南人民的斗争，支持世界人民的革命。请越南同志记住：我们一定用一切力量支持你们战斗到底。”陈庭云很激动，他把自己那本著名作品《象他那样生活》和越南南方民族解放阵线纪念章赠送给王振奎一家。
    在大队党支部书记张贵顺家里作客的是印度朋友萨霍塔，这位印度朋友是那样地兴奋和激动，他一坐到炕上就说：“太伟大了，太好了！这惊天动地的成就，要不是亲眼看见，真不能想象。不是毛泽东主席的教导，要取得这些成就是不可能的。”当他听说当地群众目前已经掀起了学习毛主席著作的热潮时，就紧握拳头有力地说：“这是中国人民具有无穷力量的原因所在！”他说：“毛泽东主席的著作来自实践，又付诸实践。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的最高阶段。”当萨霍塔谈起自己的同胞还处于苦难之中的时候，张贵顺坚毅地说：“我们不会忘记世界上被压迫的人民，我们一定要支持全世界各国人民的革命斗争。”萨霍塔惊异地望着这位普通的中国农民说：“没想到毛泽东思想把中国人民的觉悟提到了如此的高度！”
      “铁汉子”之一的周风林在家里同叙利亚代表扎达特·里卡比和萨拉马赫·奥贝德交谈得非常亲切、融洽。周风林说：沙石峪人决心为支援世界革命而奋斗。客人听了十分激动，里卡比激动地说，“中国农民的思想这样开阔，这是毛泽东思想教导的结果。今天的参观访问，使我看到了毛泽东思想已被中国革命的农民所掌握，产生了巨大的力量。”
    时间过得很快，客人们要告别了，各家主人分别向客人赠送了核桃、红枣等土产，他们怀着纯朴诚挚的感情，用最美好的语言送别各国朋友。客人们也怀着恋恋不舍的心情和社员们亲切握手，热烈拥抱。
    汽车开动后，亚非作家们怀着激动的心情，一再招手向社员们告别。
