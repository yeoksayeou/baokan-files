The emergency conference of Asian and African writers, held in Beijing on June 27, 1966, with the participation of 53 countries and regions, believes that the Kashmir issue must be resolved by the Kashmir people through the exercise of their right to self-determination.

The conference firmly believes that this issue can be reasonably resolved soon and demands that all foreign troops must immediately withdraw from Kashmir, allowing the Kashmir people the opportunity to determine their own future according to their free will. The conference also demands the immediate release of Sheikh Abdullah, who has been imprisoned in Indian jails for many years, and all other patriotic leaders of Kashmir.

The conference fully supports the liberation movement of the Kashmir people, who, despite inhuman atrocities and suppression, are fighting against the Indian occupying forces to achieve their cherished goal of self-determination.

This conference of revolutionary and patriotic writers from Asia and Africa expresses deep concern over the explosive situation in Kashmir and firmly believes that the resolution of the Kashmir issue will not only strengthen the national liberation movements in the Asian and African world but will also be a severe blow to the imperialist countries and their lackeys who are exploiting this serious situation for their selfish interests.

    关于克什米尔的决议
    一九六六年六月二十七日在北京召开的五十三个国家和地区参加的这次亚非作家紧急会议认为，克什米尔问题必须由克什米尔人民根据自决权加以解决。
    会议坚信这个问题能够早日获得合理的解决，并且要求所有外国军队必须立即撤出克什米尔，使克什米尔人民有机会根据自己的自由意志来决定自己的前途。会议还要求立即释放多年来一直被关在印度监狱里的沙赫·阿布杜拉和克什米尔所有其他爱国领导人。
    会议全力支持克什米尔人民的解放运动，他们不顾惨无人道的暴行和镇压，正在对印度占领军进行斗争，以达到他们向往的目标——自决权。
    亚非国家革命和爱国作家的这次会议，对克什米尔的爆炸性局势深表关切，坚信克什米尔问题的解决不仅将加强亚非世界的民族解放运动，同时对于为了自私的利益正在利用这一严重局势的帝国主义国家及其走狗也将是一个惨重的打击。
