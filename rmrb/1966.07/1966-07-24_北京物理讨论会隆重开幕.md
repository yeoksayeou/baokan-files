Scientists from Four Continents Bring Research Achievements and Anti-Imperialist Resolve

The Beijing Physics Discussion Conference Grandly Opens

The conference reads Premier Zhou's congratulatory message; twenty-eight scientists deliver speeches, wishing the conference a successful opening

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen emphasized in his speech:

The scientific and cultural achievements of the people of the four continents serve the people's anti-imperialist revolutionary cause. If imperialism is not overthrown and its remnants are not eliminated, the people's scientific undertakings cannot develop. Without genuine national independence and liberation, it is impossible for national scientific undertakings to develop and improve independently.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated July 23, an international scientific conference of great significance in the history of scientific development on four continents—the 1966 Summer Physics Discussion Conference of the Beijing Science Discussion Conference—opened grandly in Beijing today.

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen, on behalf of the Chinese government, the Chinese people, and Chinese scientists, delivered a congratulatory speech at the opening ceremony (full text on page four), sincerely wishing this discussion conference will write a brilliant chapter in the new development of physics and firmly believing that this conference will continue to carry forward the spirit of the 1964 Beijing Science Discussion Conference, making new contributions to the common cause of unity among scientists and people of the four continents to oppose imperialism and develop national scientific and cultural undertakings. Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen said that all scientific and cultural achievements in the world belong to a certain class and serve the political line of a certain class. Imperialist scientific and cultural achievements serve imperialist politics. The scientific and cultural achievements of the people of the four continents serve the people's anti-imperialist revolutionary cause. He stressed that in these countries that have long been invaded and oppressed, the issue of scientific development is first and foremost a political issue. If imperialism is not overthrown and its remnants are not eliminated, the people's scientific undertakings cannot develop. Without genuine national independence and liberation, it is impossible for national scientific undertakings to develop and improve independently.

Premier Zhou Enlai specially sent a congratulatory message to this conference. When this message was read at today's conference, the entire audience applauded enthusiastically for a long time.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Lin Fen, and Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and President of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology Li Siguang also attended today's opening ceremony, congratulating the successful opening of the discussion conference to more than a hundred scientists from over thirty countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania.

Scientists from the four continents not only brought many new research achievements to this discussion conference but also brought the precious friendship of the people of the four continents to the Chinese people. When Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen and other Chinese leaders and members of the conference presidium ascended the stage, the orchestra played a welcome song, and the entire audience applauded enthusiastically for a long time. Young students from the capital rushed onto the stage to present flowers to the scientists from various countries of the four continents.

The center of the conference stage prominently displayed the giant emblem of this discussion conference, with sixteen vibrant red flags on either side. The stage was adorned with blooming flowers and evergreen palm trees. The opening ceremony began at 9:30 AM, and Vice Chairman of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology and leader of the Chinese Scientists Delegation Zhou Peiyuan delivered the welcoming speech (full text on page five), expressing warm welcome to the scientists from the four continents. He said, these countries of ours in the four continents have always been regarded by imperialists, old and new colonialists, and modern revisionists as "underdeveloped" countries. Today, we, the so-called "underdeveloped" countries' scientific workers, gather together to organize such a large-scale single-discipline academic discussion conference, which is a very encouraging event. This is a victory for the people of the four continents and a victory for the scientific and technological community of the four continents. Zhou Peiyuan said, at this discussion conference, the Chinese Scientists Delegation will humbly learn from the scientists of various countries and, together with the scientists of various countries, will, in the spirit of democratic consultation, unity and cooperation, mutual learning, and common improvement, make the conference a success.

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen then delivered a congratulatory speech at the conference. His speech repeatedly aroused long and enthusiastic applause in the venue.

Twenty-eight scientists from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania also took the stage one after another amid the enthusiastic applause of the entire audience (summaries of the speeches on page five) to congratulate the successful opening of this discussion conference and wish the conference a complete success. Many scientists pointed out that to establish and develop national, people's mass scientific and cultural undertakings, scientists and people of the four continents must resolutely oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism and strive unremittingly for national independence.

The scientists from various countries who delivered speeches at today's conference are: Wei Ruqun from Vietnam, Grunbone from Uruguay, Osman from the United Arab Republic, Mulani from Uganda, Zimali from Tunisia, a physicist from Togo, Azam from Syria, Hegazi from Sudan, Jallo from Sierra Leone, Sakkar from Pakistan, Wazani from Morocco, a scientist from Mexico, Morijiro Noshita from Japan, Jita from Iraq, Sukariyo from Indonesia, Seidu from Guinea, Romero from Ecuador, Emmanuel from Congo (Brazzaville), Gamba Escalion from Colombia, Alviar from Chile, Kannangara from Ceylon, Jichun from Cambodia, U Jao Min from Burma, Roberts from Australia, a scientist from Argentina, Yusuf from Algeria, Gaisi from the East African Academy of Sciences, and Ebadi from Afghanistan.

Before the opening ceremony, leaders such as Nie Rongzhen, Guo Moruo, Lin Fen, and Li Siguang met with the members of the conference presidium.

Among them were Chen Wencheng, head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Nishizono Koji from Japan, Willy from Indonesia, Paron, representative of the Patriotic Front of Thailand abroad, Madame Kuning from Laos, Galb, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Beijing, and Christensen, a radio astronomer from Australia.

    大会宣读周总理贺电，二十八位科学家致词，共祝会议胜利召开
    聂荣臻副总理在贺词中强调指出：
    四大洲人民的科学文化，为人民反帝革命事业服务。帝国主义不打倒，帝国主义的遗毒不清除，人民的科学事业就不能发展。没有真正的民族独立和解放，就不可能有民族科学事业的独立发展和提高。
    据新华社二十三日讯  在四大洲科学发展史上具有重要意义的一次国际科学会议——北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会，今天在北京隆重开幕。
