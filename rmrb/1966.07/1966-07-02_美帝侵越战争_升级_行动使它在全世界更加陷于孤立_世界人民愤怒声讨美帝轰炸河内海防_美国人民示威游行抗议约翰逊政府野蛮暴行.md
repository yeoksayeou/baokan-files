	Worldwide condemnation of U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong
	U.S. citizens protest Johnson administration's barbaric acts

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on July 1st, people and public opinion from various countries around the world have strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' heinous crime of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong in Vietnam.

	The editorial board of Albania's "People's Voice" newspaper published an article on June 30th stating that the U.S. air pirates bombing Hanoi and Haiphong is another new crime committed by the U.S. aggressors in their escalation of the Vietnam War.

	The article states that this barbaric air raid on Hanoi and Haiphong is part of the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy on the Vietnam issue. The article points out that, with the active assistance and support of the Khrushchev revisionists, the U.S. has been waving the olive branch of "peace talks" on the Vietnam issue to implement the encirclement of socialist China.

	The article states that the Albanian people firmly believe that no matter how heinous and barbaric the crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors, they will not be able to conquer the Vietnamese people.

	The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association issued a statement on June 30th strongly condemning the vicious, barbaric, and cowardly act of aggression by the U.S. imperialists. The statement said that the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association calls on all Asian-African journalists and all revolutionary and fighting forces in the world to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's uncompromising and heroic struggle against the U.S. aggressors.

	The statement said that the Asian-African Journalists Association declares that the Vietnamese people's war is an inseparable part of the struggle of the progressive forces of the world, especially the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, against the aggression of imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys.

	The statement said that Asian-African journalists strongly condemn any attempt, regardless of its source or disguise, that aims to legalize U.S. aggression in Vietnam under the guise of "assisting the Vietnamese people." At the same time, they strongly condemn any attempt to split the genuine anti-U.S. imperialist forces in Asia and Africa and the anti-U.S. imperialist movement.

	The Pathet Lao radio station issued a commentary on July 1st pointing out: The stubborn, adventurous, and crazy actions of U.S. imperialism do not indicate its strength; on the contrary, they only show that despite bringing nearly 300,000 of its troops and those of its lackeys into South Vietnam to strengthen the war of aggression and using all the most barbaric killing tools, U.S. imperialism is suffering increasingly severe defeats.

	The commentary said that the Lao people and the Lao Patriotic Front Party fully support the Vietnamese people's stance in their struggle against U.S. aggression and to save the nation. The Lao people and the Lao Patriotic Front Party expressed their extreme outrage and strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' criminal act of aggression in escalating the war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	On June 30th, people from various parts of the United States held demonstrations and marches, strongly protesting the Johnson administration's bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.

	In Des Moines, Iowa, when U.S. President Johnson arrived at a convention hall to deliver a speech advocating the U.S. policy of war blackmail in Vietnam, hundreds of people demonstrated outside the venue, expressing their protest. The demonstrators waved placards reading, "Stop the bombing!"

	On the same day, many citizens in Washington, D.C., held a sit-in demonstration outside the White House, protesting the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.

	In New York City, 800 demonstrators marched around a military recruitment station, and a group of people held an all-night sit-in demonstration outside the office of the U.S. mission to the United Nations.

	In London, citizens held demonstrations and marches in front of the U.S. Embassy on June 29th and 30th, protesting the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.

	The demonstrators held up placards reading, "U.S. out of Vietnam!" and "Stop the U.S. killers now!" They also distributed leaflets demanding "Wilson must go," protesting the British Wilson government's support for U.S. aggression.

	The demonstrators shouted angrily in the face of police threats: "Hands off Vietnam!" "U.S. imperialists out, out!" "War-mongering U.S. out, out!" Some shouted, "Johnson, how many people did you kill today?"

	The demonstrators handed a letter of protest to the U.S. Embassy. The letter said that the U.S. unprovoked attack on Hanoi and Haiphong is a "crime against humanity."

	British philosopher Bertrand Russell issued a statement on June 30th saying: U.S. President Johnson is "as shameless and as dangerous as Hitler. People all over the world should solemnly resolve to use all their strength to demonstrate, protest, and resist this lightning attack by the United States."

	In Wellington, New Zealand, over 300 union workers, university professors, clergy, and writers held a demonstration on July 1st, protesting the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.

	The demonstrators issued a statement condemning the U.S. action of expanding the war and condemning the New Zealand government for siding with the U.S. aggressors.

	The demonstrators also demanded the immediate withdrawal of New Zealand troops from South Vietnam.

	In recent days, the New Zealand public has sent numerous telegrams to the New Zealand Prime Minister, protesting the U.S. escalation of bombing in North Vietnam. In Auckland, the U.S. Consulate received non-stop protest calls all day.

	In Sydney, Australia, over 200 women, students, and members of the "Vietnam Action Committee" demonstrated outside the U.S. Consulate on the evening of June 30th, protesting the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.

	In Melbourne, many union workers held a meeting, condemning the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong as a heinous crime.

    文章说，这次对河内和海防的野蛮空袭是美帝国主义在越南问题上反革命两手策略的组成部分。文章指出，在赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的积极帮助和支持下为了实行对社会主义中国的包围，美国一直在越南问题上大摇其“和谈”的橄榄枝。
    文章说，阿尔巴尼亚人民表示坚信，美国侵略者任何令人发指的野蛮罪行都不能征服越南人民。

    老挝巴特寮电台一日发表评论指出：美帝国主义这种顽固、冒险和疯狂的行动，并不表明它的强大，恰恰相反，只是说明美帝国主义尽管把它和它的仆从的近三十万军队运进越南南方加强侵略战争，并使用了一切最野蛮的杀人工具，但它正在遭到越来越严重的失败。
    评论说，老挝人民和老挝爱国战线党完全支持越南人民在抗美救国斗争中的立场，老挝人民和老挝爱国战线党表示无比愤怒，严厉谴责美帝国主义对越南民主共和国进行的这一罪恶的侵略“升级”。

    示威者把一封抗议信交给美国大使馆。信中说，美国无端袭击河内和海防是“对人类犯下的罪行”。
    英国著名哲学家罗素三十日发表声明说：美国总统约翰逊“同希特勒一样无耻、一样危险。全世界的人们都应当庄严地决心尽一切力量对美国的这种闪电袭击举行示威、抗议并且加以抵制。”
