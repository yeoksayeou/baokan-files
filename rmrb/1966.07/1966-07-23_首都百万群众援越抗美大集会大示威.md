The people of the world must have courage, dare to fight, be unafraid of difficulties, and advance bravely. Then, the whole world will surely belong to the people.

Title: Hundreds of Thousands of Beijing Citizens Hold a Mass Rally and Demonstration to Support Vietnam and Oppose U.S. Aggression

On July 22, nearly a million people gathered in Tiananmen Square to hold a grand rally and demonstration, expressing the Chinese people's most resolute and enthusiastic support for the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots," and their most resolute and enthusiastic support for the Vietnamese people to carry out their great struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end.

The rally solemnly declared that in the Vietnamese people's great struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, the 700 million Chinese people are the Vietnamese people's strong rear guard. The vast territory of China is the Vietnamese people's reliable rear base. The fighting friendship and solid unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam are the most reliable guarantee for defeating the U.S. aggressors. The Chinese people have made up their minds and are fully prepared to take any actions deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam at any time and place to jointly strike at the U.S. aggressors.

Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the People's Republic of China Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China Song Qingling, Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China Dong Biwu, Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Zhu De, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Deng Xiaoping, attended the mass rally today.

Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China Chen Ziping, and Head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China Chen Wencheng, were invited to attend the rally.

When they ascended the Tiananmen Gate Tower, the entire audience erupted in cheers, with people enthusiastically shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho!"

At today's rally, a statement by Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the People's Republic of China was read, as well as a telegram from Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Zhu De to Chairman Long of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Book Record of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council Tao Zhu delivered an important speech at the rally (full text on page 2).

Book Record of the Communist Party of China, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Xuefeng presided over today's rally.

The Party and state leaders who ascended the Tiananmen Gate Tower also included Political Bureau Member of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, and He Long, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Chen Boda, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Kang Sheng, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Ye Jianying, Member of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council Xie Fuzhi, Member of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Lin Feng, Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Yang Mingxuan, Peng Chuan, and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Xu Bing, Gao Chongmin, Li Siguang, Xu Deheng, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Fu Zuoyi, Cai Tingkai, President of the Supreme People's Court Yang Xiufeng, and Prosecutor General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng.

Mr. Li Zongren also participated in the rally on the Tiananmen Gate Tower.

The rally began at 8:00 AM. Early in the morning, nearly a million workers, commune members, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, fully armed militia, students, cadres, and residents from all over the city, carrying countless red flags and banners, singing revolutionary battle songs, gathered from all directions to Tiananmen Square and East and West Chang'an Streets. The people were full of fighting spirit and indignation, and the square was filled with angry denunciations of U.S. imperialism: "Victory to Vietnam! Defeat to the U.S.! Drive the U.S. imperialists out of Vietnam! Out of Asia! Out of Africa! Out of Latin America! Out of all the places they have occupied!"

Today, in the center of the red wall of the Tiananmen Gate Tower, there hung a giant portrait of Chairman Mao. On both sides of the tower, eight red flags fluttered in the wind. In the center of the square, there stood a huge banner stretching dozens of meters long: "People of the world, unite! Resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation! Overthrow U.S. imperialism!" Along the edges of the square, twelve large red balloons were raised, with giant banners hanging from them.

In the front of the square, fully armed male and female militia units were lined up. Behind the militia were the well-ordered formations of the ground, naval, and air forces of the People's Liberation Army. This heroic army had participated in the Korean War and was ready to fight side by side with the Vietnamese people to completely annihilate the evil U.S. aggressors.

The square and East and West Chang'an Streets were filled with ranks of workers, peasants, students, revolutionary cadres, and other groups from the capital. From east to west, the crowd stretched for several kilometers. They were people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, filled with revolutionary passion, and determined to stand with their Vietnamese brothers, no matter the risks or sacrifices.

Book Record of the Communist Party of China, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Xuefeng delivered the opening remarks at the rally (full text on page 2). He pointed out that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's words boosted the morale of all oppressed nations and peoples and struck down the arrogance of U.S. imperialism. The U.S. aggressors must be driven out of Vietnam, every last one of them! If they do not withdraw, we will annihilate them all!

Following that, the rally read Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement. This statement sparked a strong response throughout the audience, with a million people enthusiastically applauding and shouting for a long time: "Resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation!" "The Chinese people are determined to be the rear guard of the Vietnamese people! China is the rear base!" "Resolutely support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's battle call on July 17!"

Then, the telegram from Chairman Zhu De to Chairman Long was read.

Book Record of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council Tao Zhu, in his speech at the rally, pointed out that the publication of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" and the issuance of the partial mobilization order are significant revolutionary actions taken by the Vietnamese people in their great struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, in adherence to proletarian internationalism and patriotism. He also pointed out that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement and Chairman Zhu De's telegram to Chairman Long embody the firm determination of the 700 million Chinese people to support Vietnam and oppose U.S. aggression.

He said that U.S. imperialism attempts to use the "escalation of war" to force the Vietnamese people to surrender. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" is the strongest response to U.S. imperialism's policy of war blackmail.

He emphasized that the Vietnamese people are not afraid of destroying their pots and pans, not afraid of making great sacrifices, and are determined to fight U.S. imperialism to the end. This spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win will have a decisive impact on the Vietnamese people's complete victory over the U.S. aggressors and the ultimate victory in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

He said that in the face of U.S. imperialism's escalation of aggression in Vietnam, the Soviet revisionist leadership group has always played the role of the number one accomplice. Especially in the face of U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong and the implementation of the "bombing to force surrender" plot, the Soviet leadership group's collaborative actions have been even more enthusiastic. Recently, Moscow has become the center for helping the U.S. peddle the "peace talks" hoax.

He pointed out that the core of the current Vietnamese issue is absolutely not just the issue of stopping the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The recently issued Sino-Indian joint statement, which one-sidedly emphasizes stopping the bombing and seeks to find a solution to the Vietnamese issue within the framework of the 1954 Geneva Agreement, is precisely in line with the needs of U.S. imperialism's blackmail policy. One is "bombing to force surrender," and the other says that as long as the bombing stops, peace talks can be held. This is openly colluding with U.S. imperialism.

He pointed out that U.S. imperialism has already torn up the Geneva Agreement. Now, the U.S. has bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which has finally buried the Geneva Agreement, and all its restrictions and boundaries have been completely abolished.

He said, the Geneva Agreement no longer exists! In the current situation, to talk about the Geneva Agreement, the U.S. must unconditionally, immediately, completely, thoroughly, and cleanly withdraw all its armed forces from Vietnam. Otherwise, it would be allowing the U.S. to occupy Vietnam and enslave the Vietnamese people.

He stressed that under these circumstances, anyone who still tries to bind the hands of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of the world with the Geneva Agreement is absolutely impossible!

Under these circumstances, whatever actions the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of the world take to counter the U.S. aggressors are justified!

Under these circumstances, China's support and assistance to the Vietnamese people are even more unrestricted and unconstrained. The Chinese people have made up their minds and are fully prepared to take any actions deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam at any time and place to jointly strike at the U.S. aggressors.

Vice Premier Tao Zhu reiterated: The Chinese people are determined to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end, no matter the risks or sacrifices.

Vice Premier Tao Zhu finally enthusiastically expressed that the peoples of China and Vietnam have forged a deep fighting friendship in their long struggle against imperialism. He said that in the face of our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, there is no force in the world that can separate us. The trend of historical development determines that our two peoples will unite, fight together, and win together.

Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China Chen Ziping spoke at the rally (full text on page 2). He said that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's solemn and resolute call has ignited the patriotic spirit, hatred, and revolutionary courage of our 31 million Vietnamese people, urging us to advance bravely in the new and fierce stage of the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

Ambassador Chen Ziping strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's mad bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, the use of all barbaric war methods, and all deceitful tricks, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to surrender. He said that under this new situation, there are only two paths before the Vietnamese people: either to surrender to the threats of U.S. imperialism or to advance to victory, completely defeat the U.S. aggressors, and achieve final victory. Chairman Ho's call has pointed out the only correct path, which is: the Vietnamese people will never surrender to U.S. imperialism, and the Vietnamese people are determined to concentrate all their strength to defeat it. This is the thought, feeling, and will of the 31 million Vietnamese people, and it is the attitude of the Vietnamese people towards the new test.

He said that as long as the Vietnamese people have not achieved their basic and minimum goals: independence, unity, and territorial integrity, then they will never lay down their arms and are determined to fight, fight to the end, until there is not a single trace of an aggressor on their land. All the threats and deceitful tricks of the U.S. will suffer a miserable failure. Currently, all the accomplices who are acting as brokers for the U.S. "peace talks" hoax, such as British Prime Minister Wilson, Japanese Prime Minister Sato, and the traitor Tito, will definitely suffer a humiliating defeat.

He said that the stern warning from the powerful People's Republic of China, which is deeply and broadly carrying out the Cultural Revolution, and the 700 million Chinese people armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, is a powerful blow to the U.S. imperialism's plot to intensify the war of aggression. The sympathy and support of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Communist Party of China for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation are immense and full of proletarian internationalism. On behalf of the Vietnamese people, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Vietnam Workers' Party, I once again express my most sincere and heartfelt thanks to the Chinese people, the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China, and the respected Chairman Mao.

Ambassador Chen Ziping finally said that the people of the entire country of Vietnam are ready to launch a new battle to defeat the mortal enemy, U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism is and will continue to suffer a head-on defeat. The Vietnamese people will definitely fulfill their duty to their homeland and to the anti-U.S. cause of the peoples of all countries.

Head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China Chen Wencheng, in his speech (full text on page 3), pointed out that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" is a declaration of salvation, a heroic battle call to mobilize the 31 million Vietnamese people to advance and annihilate the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys.

Chen Wencheng, when talking about the brilliant victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, said that the victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam prove that people's war is invincible and can completely defeat the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys.

Chen Wencheng said with full confidence that the people of South Vietnam enthusiastically respond to Chairman Ho's call. Under the glorious banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, with deep hatred for the U.S. aggressors and traitorous lackeys, they will continue to bravely charge into battle with a spirit of surging flames, giving the enemy a hundredfold, a thousandfold blow. The people of South Vietnam will surely achieve brilliant victory.

He said that in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, the people of South Vietnam have already received the most resolute, powerful, and effective sympathy and support from the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Communist Party of China led by the respected Chairman Mao. Today, this large-scale rally is one of the many concrete expressions of the solidarity and common struggle of the Vietnamese people and their brotherly Chinese people.

He finally, on behalf of the people of South Vietnam and the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, expressed sincere thanks to the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Communist Party of China.

Member of the Communist Party of China, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Liu Ningyi, representing all people's organizations, all democratic parties, and non-party democrats in China, spoke at the rally (full text on page 3), expressing resolute support for Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots," resolute support for Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement and Chairman Zhu De's telegram.

He pointed out that the fact that U.S. imperialism has suffered repeated defeats in the Vietnam battlefield once again proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. He said that the larger the scale of U.S. imperialism's war of aggression in Vietnam, the more miserable its defeat will be.

He condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership group for constantly trying to bring the Vietnamese issue into the track of U.S.-Soviet cooperation and for always serving U.S. imperialism. He said that facts tell us that to oppose imperialism, we must also oppose revisionism. In the hot struggle against U.S. imperialism, we must not engage in any joint actions with the accomplices of U.S. imperialism.

Liu Ningyi stressed that we are an invincible people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We will take any actions deemed necessary by the Vietnamese people at any time and place. We will support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation in every way until we completely defeat the U.S. aggressors and achieve final victory.

The telegram from Chairman Zhu De and the speeches by Vice Premier Tao Zhu, Ambassador Chen Ziping, Head Chen Wencheng, and Liu Ningyi at the rally sparked thunderous applause throughout the audience, with people continuously shouting: "Salute to the heroic Vietnamese people!" "People of the world, unite! Overthrow U.S. imperialism!" "The people of the world will win! U.S. imperialism will be defeated!"

Today, the Vietnamese representatives who were invited to ascend the Tiananmen Gate Tower to participate in the rally also included: Deputy Head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China Nguyen Minh Phuong, Head of the Vietnamese Scientific Delegation to the Beijing Summer Physics Seminar Wei Ruqun Song, Head of the Vietnamese Delegation to the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers Chen Tingyun, and other Vietnamese comrades in Beijing Ding Shijin, Nguyen Van Luc.

Foreign friends on the Tiananmen Gate Tower also included: Political Bureau Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belgium Wang Delin Tong, famous Black American leader Robert Williams and his wife, General Secretary of the Asian-African Journalists' Association Qia Huaduo, American friends Coverland and Aidele, Japanese peace activist Nishizono Koji, President of the Lao Women's Federation Gui Ning, Indonesian peace activist Wei Li, Chief of the Palestine Liberation Organization Office in Beijing Jie Bu, Representative of the Thai Patriotic Front abroad Parong, and Sudanese peace activist Kai Er.

There were also some foreign friends from Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe, and other regions of the world participating in the rally on the viewing platform. Among them were: representatives from various countries attending the Beijing Summer Physics Seminar, visiting guests in Beijing, experts from various countries helping with China's construction, as well as Vietnamese and other countries' students and trainees.

Participants in the rally also included leaders from various departments of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, leaders of the People's Liberation Army, leaders of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and leaders of Beijing Municipality.

The rally ended at 9:30 AM, with a million people continuously shouting slogans such as "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho!" "Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards," the revolutionary spirit of the people was extremely high, and the entire square was filled with a surging, thunderous atmosphere.

Subsequently, the crowds set off from Tiananmen Square and East and West Chang'an Streets in separate groups to hold a grand demonstration march. The entire city of Beijing was filled with a strong atmosphere of supporting Vietnam and opposing U.S. aggression. (Accompanied by pictures)

    全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。
    首都百万群众援越抗美大集会大示威
    刘少奇宋庆龄董必武周恩来朱德邓小平等党和国家领导人出席大会
    大会宣读了刘少奇主席代表七亿中国人民向全世界发出的庄严声明
    李雪峰同志致开会词　陶铸副总理陈子平大使陈文成团长刘宁一同志讲话
    新华社二十二日讯　首都今天上午有近百万人汇集天安门广场，举行声势浩大的集会和游行，表示中国人民最坚决、最热烈地支持越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》，最坚决、最热烈地支持越南人民把伟大的抗美救国斗争进行到最后胜利。
    大会庄严宣告，在越南人民伟大的抗美救国斗争中，七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾。中国辽阔的国土，是越南人民的可靠后方。中越两国人民的战斗友谊和坚强团结，是战胜美国侵略者的最可靠的保证。中国人民下定了决心，做好了各种准备，随时随地采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动，共同打击美国侵略者。
    中共中央副主席、中华人民共和国主席刘少奇，中华人民共和国副主席宋庆龄，中共中央政治局委员、中华人民共和国副主席董必武，中共中央副主席、国务院总理周恩来，中共中央副主席、全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长朱德，中共中央总书记邓小平，参加了今天的群众大会。
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使陈子平，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长陈文成，应邀出席了大会。
    当他们登上天安门城楼时，全场发出一片欢呼，人们热烈高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“胡主席万岁！”
    在今天的大会上，宣读了中华人民共和国主席刘少奇的声明，还宣读了全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长朱德致越南民主共和国国会常务委员会主席长征的电报。
    中共中央书记处书记、国务院副总理陶铸，在大会上发表了重要讲话（全文见第二版）。
    中共中央书记处书记、中共北京市委第一书记、人大常委会副委员长李雪峰，主持今天的大会。
    登上天安门城楼的党和国家领导人，还有中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅、李富春、贺龙，中共中央政治局候补委员陈伯达，中共中央政治局候补委员、中央书记处书记、人大常委会副委员长康生，中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理薄一波，中共中央书记处书记、国防委员会副主席叶剑英，中共中央委员、国务院副总理谢富治，中共中央委员、人大常委会副委员长林枫、刘宁一，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若、杨明轩、程潜，以及政协全国委员会副主席徐冰、高崇民、李四光、许德珩，国防委员会副主席傅作义、蔡廷锴，最高人民法院院长杨秀峰，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞。
    李宗仁先生也在天安门城楼参加了大会。
    大会在上午八时开始举行。清早，近百万首都工人、人民公社社员、中国人民解放军指战员、全副武装的民兵、大中学生、机关干部、街道居民等，就举着数不清的红旗和标语牌，高唱着革命的战斗歌曲，从四面八方向天安门广场和东西长安街汇集。人们斗志昂扬，群情激愤，会场上响彻着对美帝国主义愤怒的声讨声：“越南必胜！美帝必败！”“美帝国主义从越南滚出去！从亚洲滚出去！从非洲滚出去！从拉丁美洲滚出去！从它侵占的一切地方滚出去！”
    今天，天安门城楼的红墙正中，挂着毛主席的巨幅画象。城楼两侧，八面红旗迎风招展。在广场中央，竖立着一幅横贯数十米长的大标语：“全世界人民团结起来，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争，打倒美帝国主义！”沿着广场四周，升起了十二个红色大气球，气球上悬挂着巨幅标语。
    在广场的最前面，排列着全副武装的男女民兵队伍。民兵的后面是中国人民解放军陆海空军部队严整的队形。这支英雄的部队过去参加过抗美援朝战争，今天，他们随时准备同越南人民并肩作战，彻底消灭万恶的美国强盗。
    广场上，和东西长安街上，站满了首都工人、农民、学生、革命干部及其他各界群众的队伍。自东到西，人群延伸了数公里长。他们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民，他们满怀着革命激情，他们表示不管冒任何风险，不管付出多大代价，都要和兄弟的越南人民站在一起。
    中共中央书记处书记、中共北京市委第一书记、人大常委会副委员长李雪峰在大会上致开会词（全文见第二版）。他指出，胡志明主席的话，长了一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民的志气，灭了美帝国主义的威风。美国强盗必须一个不剩地从越南滚出去！它们不撤走，就把它们统统消灭掉！
    随后，大会上宣读了刘少奇主席的声明。这个声明在全场激起了强烈的反响，百万群众热烈鼓掌，长时间地高呼：“坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争！”“中国人民誓为越南人民的后盾！中国是越南的后方！”“坚决支持胡志明主席七月十七日的战斗号召！”
    接着，宣读了朱德委员长致长征主席的电报。
    中共中央书记处书记、国务院副总理陶铸在大会上的讲话中指出，胡志明主席《告全国同胞书》的发表和局部动员令的颁布，是坚持无产阶级国际主义和爱国主义的越南人民在抗美救国的伟大斗争中所采取的具有重大意义的革命行动。他还指出，刘少奇主席的声明和朱德委员长给长征主席的电报，体现了七亿中国人民援越抗美的坚定决心。
    他说，美帝国主义妄图用“战争升级”的办法，迫使越南人民屈服投降。胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》，是对美帝国主义的这种战争讹诈政策最强有力的回答。
    他强调指出，越南人民不怕打烂坛坛罐罐，不怕作出重大牺牲，决心同美帝国主义干到底，这种敢于斗争，敢于胜利的精神，必将对越南人民彻底打败美国侵略者，争取抗美救国斗争的完全胜利，产生决定性的作用。
    他说，在美帝国主义扩大侵略越南的战争中，苏联修正主义领导集团一直扮演着头号帮凶的角色。特别是在美国轰炸河内、海防，推行“以炸迫和”的阴谋中，苏联领导集团的配合活动更加卖力。最近，莫斯科已经成为帮助美国推销“和谈”骗局的中心。
    他说，当前越南问题的核心，绝不是什么仅仅停止对越南民主共和国轰炸的问题。最近发表的苏印联合公报，片面强调停止轰炸，要在一九五四年的日内瓦协议范围内找到解决越南问题的办法，这正是适应美帝国主义讹诈政策的需要。一个是“以炸迫和”，一个说只要停止轰炸，就可以和谈，这是公开地同美帝国主义一唱一和。
    他指出，美帝国主义早已把日内瓦协议撕光了。现在，美国轰炸了越南民主共和国的首都，这就最后埋葬了日内瓦协议，日内瓦协议的一切限制和界限被统统地取消了。
    他说，日内瓦协议已经不存在了！在目前形势下，要谈日内瓦协议，就必须要美国无条件地立即、全部、彻底、干净地撤出它在越南的武装力量。否则，就是听任美国霸占越南，奴役越南人民。
    他强调说，在这种情况下，任何人还企图用日内瓦协议来束缚越南人民的手脚，束缚中国人民的手脚，束缚世界革命人民的手脚，那是绝对办不到的！
    在这种情况下，越南人民、中国人民、世界革命人民，不论采取什么行动，来反击美国侵略者，都是天经地义的！
    在这种情况下，中国人民对越南人民的支持和援助，就更加不受任何限制和约束了。中国人民下定了决心，做好了各种准备，随时随地采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动，共同打击美国侵略者。
    陶铸副总理重申：中国人民决心不怕冒任何风险，不惜付出任何重大代价，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国的斗争进行到最后胜利。
    陶铸副总理最后热烈地表示，中越两国人民在反对帝国主义的长期斗争中，结成了深厚的战斗友谊。他说，面对着我们两国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义，世界上更没有任何力量能够把我们分开。历史发展的趋势决定了我们两国人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使陈子平在大会上讲话
  （全文见第二版），他说，胡志明主席庄严的坚强的号召，激起了我们三千一百万越南人民的爱国心、仇恨的火焰和革命的勇气，号召我们越南人民在抗美救国事业的新的激烈阶段中英勇前进。
    陈子平大使强烈谴责美帝国主义疯狂轰炸河内、海防，采取一切野蛮的战争手段和一切欺骗的伎俩，妄图迫使越南人民屈服。他说，在这种新的形势下，摆在我们越南人民面前的只有两条道路：或者是屈服于美帝国主义的威胁，或者是乘胜前进，彻底打败美国侵略强盗，争取最后胜利。胡主席的号召书已经指出了唯一的正确道路，这条道路就是：越南人民绝不屈服于美帝国主义，越南人民决心集中全力打败它。这是三千一百万越南人民的思想、感情和愿望，是越南人民对待新的考验的态度。
    他说，只要越南人民还没有达到基本和起码的目标：独立、统一和领土完整，那么，他们决不放下武器，决心打，打到底，直到在自己的国土上再也没有一个侵略者的影子时才罢休。美国的一切恫吓和一切欺骗手段必将遭到惨痛的破产。目前正在为美国的
  “和谈”骗局充当掮客的美国所有的帮凶，如英国首相威尔逊、日本首相佐藤、叛徒铁托之流，一定将遭到可耻的失败。
    他说，正在深入、广泛地进行文化大革命的强大的中华人民共和国以及用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民的严厉警告，是对美帝国主义策划加紧进行侵略战争的阴谋的有力打击。中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党对越南人民抗美救国事业的同情和支援是无比巨大的，是充满无产阶级国际主义精神的。我代表越南人民、越南民主共和国政府和越南劳动党，再一次向中国人民、中国政府、中国共产党和敬爱的毛主席表示最真诚、最深切的感谢。
    陈子平大使最后说，越南全国人民已经准备投入新的战斗，击败死敌美帝国主义。美帝国主义正在而且将要继续遭到迎头痛击。越南人民一定要对自己的祖国、对世界各国人民的反美事业尽到自己的义务。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长陈文成在讲话（全文见第三版）中指出，胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》，是救国的宣言，是动员三千一百万越南人民冲向前，消灭美国强盗及其走狗的雄壮的战斗号角。
    陈文成谈到越南南方军民在抗美救国斗争中所取得的辉煌胜利时说，越南南方军民所取得的胜利证明了，人民战争是所向无敌的，它完全可以打败美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗。
    陈文成满怀信心地说，越南南方人民热烈响应胡主席的号召，他们在越南南方民族解放阵线的光荣旗帜下，怀着对美国侵略强盗及卖国走狗的深仇大恨，将继续以烈火冲天的气魄，勇敢地向敌人冲锋陷阵，给予它们以一百倍、一千倍的打击。越南南方人民必将最后取得辉煌胜利。
    他说，越南南方人民在反美救国斗争中，已经得到以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党最坚决、最有力和最有效的同情和支持。今天，这个大规模集会，就是越南人民和兄弟的中国人民团结战斗和生死与共的情谊的许多具体表现之一。
    他最后代表越南南方人民、越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会向中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党表示真诚的谢意。
    中共中央委员、人大常委会副委员长、中华全国总工会主席刘宁一，代表我国各人民团体、各民主党派和无党派民主人士在大会上讲话（全文见第三版），表示坚决支持胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》，坚决拥护刘少奇主席的声明和朱德委员长的电报。
    他指出，美帝国主义在越南战场上屡战屡败的事实，再一次证明了毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎这一论断的正确。他说，美帝国主义侵略越南的战争，规模越大，它的失败就越惨。
    他谴责苏联修正主义领导集团念念不忘把越南问题纳入美苏合作的轨道，一贯为美帝国主义效劳。他说，事实告诉我们，反帝必须反修，在反对美帝国主义火热的斗争中，决不能同美帝国主义的帮凶搞什么联合行动。
