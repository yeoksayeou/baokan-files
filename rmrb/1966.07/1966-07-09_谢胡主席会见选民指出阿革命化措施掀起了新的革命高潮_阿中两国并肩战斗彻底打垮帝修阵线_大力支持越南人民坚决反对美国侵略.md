According to a report by the New China News Agency in Tirana on the 6th, the Albanian News Agency reported: On the 4th, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, Shehu, spoke to voters in Tirana, saying that the Albanian government and all the Albanian people strongly support the just struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people against the aggressors of American imperialism. We strongly protest the criminal acts of the American aggressors in bombing the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the city of Haiphong. We are firmly convinced that the fraternal Vietnamese people, through their resolute struggle, will foil the conspiracies of the imperialists and revisionists and will defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys to achieve final victory. Shehu made these remarks when meeting with voters in the 206th electoral district of Tirana.

Shehu pointed out in this speech that from the last election in 1962 to the present day, it has been a period of the most severe test for our people and our Party since the national liberation struggle. Socialist Albania, under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour, has been advancing along the path indicated by them. It has been unyielding in its struggle against the most rabid revisionists and the most ferocious imperialists, and it has not knelt down. Instead, it has raised high the sacred banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and with revolutionary heroism, it has smashed their attacks and sabotage activities in the political, ideological, and economic spheres. In this struggle, we have learned who our true friends are and who our enemies are.

Shehu said, “The great people of China under the leadership of Mao Zedong are our greatest and most loyal ally, and we will never forget this. Great China is the standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism and socialism, and the banner against imperialism and revisionism. Together with the people of China, we will, as always, stand at the forefront of our historic revolutionary struggle, a struggle that concerns not only the fate of socialism in China and Albania but also the fate of socialism in the world. We will fight side by side to the end until we thoroughly defeat the imperialist and revisionist lines.” He said, “The strength of Marxism-Leninism, the strength against imperialism, the strength against revisionism, and the strength against reactionaries, in fact, in this life-and-death struggle, are in the majority. There is no doubt that in this struggle, the final victory will belong to the peoples of the world and Marxism-Leninism. History has determined that imperialism and revisionism will suffer a thorough defeat.”

Shehu said that 1966 is a year of important revolutionary turning points for Albania. Because in this year, Albania has launched a new revolutionary high tide, further revolutionizing the life and consciousness of our people, with the aim not only of carrying the socialist revolution to the end but also of blocking all roads to the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in our country.

Chairman Shehu said, “The freedom of our people was won by the gun. To ensure that it is not harmed by anyone, we must take up the gun to defend freedom throughout the entire historical period when there is a danger of freedom being destroyed and the danger of capitalism being restored. Therefore, our Party has given the gun to the people so that the people always feel that they are in power.

“In addition to the weapons of war, that is, the gun, our Party has always and will continue to arm our people with the most powerful weapon in the world, a weapon that no force can destroy—the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism. This enables the people to always distinguish friends from enemies, right from wrong, what is Marxism-Leninism and what is revisionism, what is revolutionary and what is counter-revolutionary, what is loyal to the interests of the people and what is betrayal of the interests of the people. When the people firmly grasp these two weapons, compared to the weapons of war, the ideological weapon of the proletariat must always take the leading position. In this way, the people are invincible; foreign enemies will not be able to attack our country militarily, and traitors like Khrushchev who betray the people and seize the leadership of the Party and the state will not be able to act.”

Shehu then discussed the issue of conducting communist education to eliminate bourgeois ideological influences in people's minds. He said, “Revolutionaries are people, and counter-revolutionaries are also people. If we are well prepared ideologically, if we have the tempering of wholehearted revolutionaries, if we are prepared to overcome every difficulty, endure all hardships and sufferings, no matter how severe the situation is, in a word, we have the Party, and the working masses who are ideologically qualified and tempered by the revolution, we will be able to accomplish the revolutionary tasks, and no external force will be able to defeat us.” He said, “Therefore, our Party believes that in determining the fate of the revolution and socialism, internal factors are decisive, and external factors are secondary. Therefore, our Party has put forward the issue of ideological and political education and revolutionary tempering of people, the working masses, especially cadres and youth, as the most important task at present.”

    谢胡主席会见选民指出阿革命化措施掀起了新的革命高潮
    阿中两国并肩战斗彻底打垮帝修阵线  大力支持越南人民坚决反对美国侵略
    据新华社地拉那六日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡四日在地拉那向选民讲话时说，阿尔巴尼亚政府和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民大力支持英勇的越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略者的正义斗争。我们强烈抗议美国侵略者轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内和海防市的罪恶行动。我们深信，兄弟的越南人民通过他们的坚决斗争，将会挫败帝国主义者和修正主义者的阴谋，将会战胜美国侵略者及其走狗而取得最后胜利。谢胡是在同地拉那第二百零六选区的选民会见时讲这些话的。
    谢胡在这次讲话中指出，从一九六二年上次选举到今天，对于我国人民和我们的党来说，是民族解放斗争之后最严酷的考验的时期。社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚沿着以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党所指明的道路向前迈进，它坚持不懈地努力奋斗。它对最疯狂的修正主义者和最凶恶的帝国主义者进行了针锋相对的斗争，它并没有屈膝，而是高举马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的神圣旗帜，以革命的英雄气概，粉碎了他们在政治上、意识形态上、经济上的进攻和破坏活动。在这场斗争中，我们懂得了谁是我们真正的朋友，谁是我们的敌人。
    谢胡说，“毛泽东的人民中国是同我们站在一起的最伟大最忠实的盟友，我们永远不会忘记这一点。伟大的中国是马克思列宁主义和社会主义的旗手，是反对帝国主义和反对修正主义的旗帜。我们同人民中国一起，将一如既往，始终站在具有历史意义的我们的革命斗争的最前线，这一斗争不仅关系到中国和阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义的命运，也关系到全世界的社会主义的命运。我们将并肩战斗到底，直到彻底打垮帝国主义阵线和修正主义阵线为止。他说，“马克思列宁主义的力量、反对帝国主义的力量、反对修正主义的力量以及反对反动派的力量，实际上在这场你死我活的总斗争中占多数。毫无疑问，在这场斗争中，最后胜利一定属于各国人民和马克思列宁主义，历史注定帝国主义和修正主义必将遭到彻底失败。”
    谢胡说，一九六六年是阿尔巴尼亚发生重要的革命转折点的一年。因为，在这一年，阿尔巴尼亚掀起了新的革命高潮，使我国的生活和人的觉悟进一步革命化，其目的不仅是把社会主义革命进行到底，而且是堵塞在我国产生修正主义和资本主义复辟的一切道路。
    谢胡主席说，“我国人民的自由是靠枪杆子得来的。为了使它不受任何人的损害，就必须在人民自由有消灭的危险和有复辟资本主义的危险的整个历史时期，拿起枪杆子来保卫自由。因此我们的党把枪杆子交给了人民，好使人民经常感觉到自己掌握着政权。
   “除了作战的武器，即枪杆子以外，我们的党过去和现在始终用世界上另一种最强有力的、任何力量都摧毁不了的武器——马克思列宁主义的思想武器更好地武装我国人民，使人民始终能分清谁是朋友、谁是敌人，分清是非，分清什么是马克思列宁主义、什么是修正主义，分清革命和反革命，分清什么是忠于人民的利益，什么是出卖人民的利益。当人民牢固地掌握了这两种武器的时候，同作战的武器相比，无产阶级思想的武器必须始终占首要地位，这样，人民是不可战胜的；外来的敌人休想在军事上进攻我国，象赫鲁晓夫那样背叛人民和篡夺党和国家的领导权的人休想动手。”
    谢胡接着谈到进行共产主义教育在人的思想中消灭资产阶级思想影响的问题。他说，“干革命的是人，搞反革命活动的也是人。如果我们在思想上有了很好的准备，如果我们有全心全意的革命者的锻炼，如果我们准备好克服每一个困难，忍受一切痛苦和艰难，不管情况怎样严重，一句话，我们有党，有在思想上合乎要求并经受过革命锻炼的劳动群众，我们将能完成革命任务，任何外来的力量都战胜不了我们。”他说，“因此我们的党认为，在决定革命、社会主义的命运方面，内因是决定性的，外因是次要的。因此我们的党提出了对人、对劳动群众，特别是对干部和青年进行思想政治教育和革命锻炼的问题，作为当前最重要的任务。”
