In our platoon's dormitory hallway, there hangs a green mailbox. Whenever comrades come to mail letters, they naturally think of the origin of this mailbox. In the past, the platoon did not have a mailbox, so comrades would write letters and place them on the table in the platoon office or on the windowsill in groups of threes and fours. Liu Yingjun noticed this and took it to heart. He found some wooden boards and, during his rest time, made a small mailbox. He painted it green and wrote two big red characters on it: "Mailbox." From then on, whoever wrote a letter would simply drop it in, and the communications officer would collect them all and send them to the post office. The comrades praised it enthusiastically.

In the autumn of 1965, the second squad was on duty alone. The weather was getting colder, and they needed to build a stove for heating. However, the space was too small to build one; and to build a fire wall, there weren't enough materials. What to do? Liu Yingjun pondered this in his heart. He walked around the area and finally found an old tin bucket. He and his squadmate, Su Xuedong, hammered and banged on it, installed a grate, and made a small stove. After testing it, it worked very well. This heating problem was solved without spending a single penny.

This February, Liu Yingjun was transferred to the third squad. At that time, the third squad had added a horse, but there weren't enough horse bits. Following Chairman Mao's teachings on thrift, Liu Yingjun found several old, discarded horse bits. He took a piece of leather from one and a few iron rings from another, pieced them together, and made a usable horse bit.

After Liu Yingjun's martyrdom, we recalled the many good deeds he had done in the platoon. He treated doing good deeds as a revolutionary practice, using practice to temper and transform himself. In the past, we didn't pay much attention to these things; some we didn't even know about. Now, looking back, on the training ground, in the classroom, in the kitchen, in the club, and in every corner of the platoon, there are traces of his good deeds everywhere. His spirit of loving the collective and acting in the public interest deeply educates us!

　　按照毛主席的教导去实践
　　　　　　　群集
    在我们连宿舍的走廊里，挂着一只绿色的信箱。每当同志们来寄信的时候，自然地要想起这只信箱的来历。过去，连里没有信箱，同志们写了信，就三三两两地放在连部桌子上、窗台上。刘英俊看在眼里，记在心上。他找来几块木板，利用休息时间，做了一个小信箱，还在上面涂上了绿颜色，写了红红的两个大字：“信箱”。从此，谁要是写了信，往里一投，到时候由通信员一起送往邮局。同志们连声称好。
    一九六五年秋天，二班单独在外执勤。天气渐渐冷了，屋里要砌一个取暖的火炉。可是，地方太小，砌不开；要修个火墙，又没有那么多材料。怎么办呢？刘英俊心里暗暗考虑。他在驻地周围到处转，终于找到一个破铅桶。他和同班的苏旭东同志一起，敲敲打打，装上个炉条，做成了一个小火炉，经过试烧，很管用。这个取暖的难题，就这么一文不花地解决了。
    今年二月，刘英俊调到三班。这时，三班补充了一匹马，马嚼子不够用了。刘英俊同志遵照毛主席勤俭节约的教导，找出几副已经报废的马嚼子，从这一副上拆下一节皮子，从那一副上解下几个铁环，七拼八凑，搞成了一副堪用的马嚼子。
    刘英俊同志牺牲以后，我们回忆了他生前在连队做的大量的好事。他把做好事当作革命的实践，通过实践来锻炼改造自己。过去，我们对这些都不大在意，有的根本不知道。现在一看，在操场，在课堂，在炊事房，在俱乐部，在连队的每个角落里，到处都有他做好事的遗迹。他那种热爱集体、事事为公的精神，深深地教育了我们！
