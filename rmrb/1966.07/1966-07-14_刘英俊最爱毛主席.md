Our artillery battery's comrades, whenever we see the portrait of Chairman Mao that Liu Yingjun comrade hung on the wall with his own hands, we recall the scenes of his deep love for our great leader Chairman Mao.

The comrades in our squad all remember that on the day Liu Yingjun comrade was transferred to the third squad, he brought with him four portraits of Chairman Mao. He did not unpack his bag or tidy his bed, but first cleaned the walls all around. Then, he hung up the portraits of Chairman Mao, one by one, neatly and properly. Later, the comrades also noticed that Liu Yingjun would always tidy up the portraits of Chairman Mao in the morning, straightening them and gently wiping off the dust. In the evening, after duty, he would always go to the portraits of Chairman Mao, gazing up at Chairman Mao's benevolent and affectionate face. Year after year, day after day, it was always like this.

At one time, the wall was damp and leaking, to protect the portraits of Chairman Mao, he specially used a piece of oil paper to back the frames. Once, he returned from an outing and found that one of the portraits of Chairman Mao had a missing pin at the edge. He quickly found a pin to replace it.

Liu Yingjun, this son of a poor peasant, harbored such deep proletarian revolutionary feelings for our great leader Chairman Mao!

He felt proud, honored, and happy to have been born in the era of Mao Zedong. He could not go a day without Chairman Mao.

Once, our squad was to be transferred to a certain place to carry out a mission. Liu Yingjun first took down the portraits of Chairman Mao, wrapping them layer after layer with white paper; upon arriving at the new station, he immediately hung up the portraits of Chairman Mao again. This deep affection for the leader from the heart deeply influenced the surrounding comrades.

One evening, he and Deputy Squad Leader Wang Chunming went for a walk and had a heart-to-heart talk. When they talked about the current situation of the world's people's revolutionary struggle, Liu Yingjun excitedly said:

"I loved to sing 'There is a North Star in the sky, and there is Mao Zedong on the earth' when I was young. But it was only in these past few years that I truly understood this sentence." At this time, he pointed to the bright North Star and said: "Chairman Mao is the 'North Star' of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao is also the 'North Star' of the world's people!"

Before the Spring Festival this year, the leadership approved Liu Yingjun comrade to visit his family. When he was about to leave the company, he specially instructed the squad leader: "Squad leader, if our squad moves, there must be someone responsible for the portraits of Chairman Mao. When we arrive at the new station, hang up the portraits of Chairman Mao first, so that the comrades can see Chairman Mao every day."

The squad leader was very moved and said: "You can rest assured, we will not forget!" When asked if there was anything else, he said: "There is nothing else, I just have this one concern."

He had four portraits of Chairman Mao, which he personally framed and hung on the walls of the dormitory, so that the comrades could see Chairman Mao every day and never forget Chairman Mao's teachings. This is the squad leader Li Hongji (second from the right) of the squad where Liu Yingjun comrade used to be, introducing the story of Liu Yingjun's boundless love for Chairman Mao to the visiting comrades.

### 刘英俊最爱毛主席

　　刘英俊最爱毛主席
    我们炮连的同志，每当看到刘英俊同志生前亲手挂在墙上的毛主席像，就回想起他热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席的情景来。
    我们班的同志都记得，刘英俊同志刚调到三班来的那一天，随身带来了四幅毛主席象。他背包不解，铺位不整，先把四周墙壁打扫一遍，然后，把毛主席象一幅一幅、端端正正地悬挂起来。以后，同志们还发现，刘英俊清晨整理内务，总是先把毛主席象正一正，用手轻轻地拂去象上的灰尘。晚上，执勤回来，他总要到毛主席象前，深情仰望毛主席慈祥亲切的面容。常年累月，天天如此。
    有一个时期，墙上潮湿渗水，为了保护好毛主席象，他专门用一块油毡纸衬托在象框的背面。一次，他外出归来，发现一张毛主席象的边上少了一颗图钉，他赶忙找了一颗补上。
    刘英俊，这个贫农的儿子，心里蕴藏着对我们伟大领袖毛主席多么深挚的无产阶级的革命感情啊！
    他为生长在毛泽东时代而感到骄傲、自豪和幸福。他一天也离不开毛主席。
    一次，我们班要调到某地去执行任务。刘英俊首先把毛主席象取下来，用白纸包了一层又一层；到了新的驻地后，他又马上把毛主席象挂起来。这种对领袖出于内心的感情，深深地感染了周围的同志。
    一天傍晚，他和副班长王春明一起散步谈心。当他们谈到当前世界人民革命斗争的胜利形势时，刘英俊兴奋地说：
  “我小时候就爱唱‘天上有个北斗星，地上有个毛泽东’这个歌。不过真正懂得这句话，还是在这几年。”这时，他指着明亮的北斗星说：“毛主席是中国人民的‘北斗星’，毛主席也是世界人民的‘北斗星’！”
    今年春节前夕，领导上批准刘英俊同志探家。他临离开连队的时候，专门向班长作了交代：“班长啊！咱们班要是挪动地方，毛主席象一定要有专人负责。到了新的驻地，先把毛主席象挂起来，好让同志们天天看到毛主席。”
    班长听了很受感动，说：“你放心好了，我们一定不会忘！”问他还有什么事？他说：“没有别的，我就这一件心事。”
