British Prime Minister Wilson, at the behest of Johnson, arrives in Moscow to meet with Kosygin

	Newspaper: People's Daily
	Date: July 17, 1966

	British Prime Minister Wilson, at the invitation of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Kosygin, arrived in Moscow on the 16th and immediately held talks with Kosygin.

	Wilson arrived on the same day that Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi concluded her activities in Moscow. Both Gandhi and Wilson are accomplices in the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, and their successive visits to the Soviet Union are not coincidental. This is a highly coordinated action aimed at colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership to intensify efforts to serve the U.S. "bombing for peace" plot.

	This is Wilson's second visit to Moscow in five months. Although the Soviet side is still trying to deceive by claiming that Wilson is there to "visit an exhibition," the British side has explicitly stated from the outset that Wilson is going to discuss a "peaceful solution" to the Vietnam issue with Soviet leaders. Wilson himself, before leaving London on the 16th, clearly stated that he was going to discuss the Vietnam issue. He emphasized that he and his "friends" believe that "negotiations" are "necessary" to end the Vietnam War. It is reported that the "proposals" he took to Moscow include reconvening the Geneva Conference and "strengthening" the so-called "International Control Commission," using it as another "pathway" for "peace testers." British newspapers acknowledge that before Wilson announced his mission to Moscow to "seek peace in Vietnam," he had conducted "full consultations" with U.S. President Johnson. By the end of this month, he will also go to Washington to report on his visit to the Soviet Union to Johnson. The U.S. government also does not deny that this is a "joint action" by the U.S. and Britain. Therefore, before Wilson's departure, Washington repeatedly reaffirmed the U.S. position of "welcoming" the reopening of the Geneva Conference.

	According to the Washington Post, the Johnson administration has high hopes for Wilson's visit to Moscow because the U.S. side believes that "the Soviets have always been eager for peace." The British Sun newspaper also says: "The Russians have shown that they are very willing to discuss (the possibility of peace) on the Vietnam issue." Because "they are very troubled by the Vietnam War," they "may hope to finally prepare conditions for a breakthrough in peace talks."

	However, any "peace talks" plot by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will never succeed. The heroic Vietnamese people have given a firm response to these deceptive tricks: as long as there is still one invader on Vietnamese soil, the Vietnamese people will continue to fight, using force to drive the American bandits out of Vietnam.

### 英苏加紧勾结为美帝和谈阴谋效劳　威尔逊奉约翰逊之命到莫斯科同柯西金会谈

　　英苏加紧勾结为美帝和谈阴谋效劳
　　威尔逊奉约翰逊之命到莫斯科同柯西金会谈
    新华社十七日讯　英国首相威尔逊应苏联部长会议主席柯西金的邀请，已经在十六日到达莫斯科，并且立即同柯西金举行了会谈。
    威尔逊是在印度总理英迪拉·甘地夫人结束她在莫斯科的活动的同一天到达的。甘地夫人和威尔逊都是美国侵略越南的帮凶，他们接踵访问苏联并非偶然。这是一个十分紧密地配合着的行动，目的是为了勾结苏联修正主义领导集团，加紧为美国“以炸迫和”的阴谋效劳。
    威尔逊的这次莫斯科之行是五个月里的第二次。尽管苏联方面还在掩耳盗铃，说什么威尔逊是去“参观展览会”的，但是，英国方面一开始就明白表示，威尔逊是去同苏联领导人商谈越南问题的“和平解决”方案的。威尔逊本人在十六日离开伦敦前也明确谈到他是去谈越南问题的。他强调，他和他的“朋友们”认为，“谈判”对于结束越南战争是“必要的”。据报道，他带到莫斯科去的“建议”中，包括重新召开日内瓦会议和“加强”所谓“国际监督委员会”，把它作为“和平试探者”的另一条“途径”。英报纸承认，威尔逊在宣布到莫斯科去执行这次“寻求越南和平的使命”之前，曾经同美国总统约翰逊进行了“充分的磋商”。在本月底，他还将去华盛顿向约翰逊报告访苏情况。美国官方也不否认，这是一次美英“共同行动”。因此，在威尔逊启程前，华盛顿接连重申了美国“欢迎”重开日内瓦会议的立场。
    据《华盛顿邮报》报道，约翰逊政府对威尔逊的莫斯科之行抱有希望，因为美国方面认为，“苏联人一直是切望和平的”。英国的《太阳报》也说：“俄国人已经表明他们非常愿意讨论（在越南问题上）和平的可能性”。由于“他们被越南战争弄得很为难”，所以他们“可能希望终于为和平谈判来一个突破准备条件”。
    但是，美帝国主义及其走卒们的任何“和谈”阴谋都是绝对不能得逞的。英雄的越南人民对这些欺骗花招已经作出了坚定的回答：只要在越南土地上还有一个侵略者，越南人民就要继续战斗，用武力把美国强盗赶出越南。
