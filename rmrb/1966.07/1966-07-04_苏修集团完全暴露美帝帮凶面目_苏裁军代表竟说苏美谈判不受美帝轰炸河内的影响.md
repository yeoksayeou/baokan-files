The Soviet revisionist group has completely exposed its role as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism. A Soviet representative at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, Roshin, stated in an interview with reporters that the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong would not affect Soviet-American negotiations on disarmament and the reaching of an agreement. This once again exposes the Soviet leadership as accomplices to the U.S. "bombing to coerce" conspiracy.

According to a Reuters news agency report dated June 30 from Geneva, a reporter asked Roshin, "In light of the latest developments in Vietnam, does he think it is possible to reach an agreement?" Roshin replied, "If we did not think there was such a possibility, we would not be here."

According to this news agency, although Roshin expressed "protest" against the U.S. bombing in that day's disarmament conference, "he did not link the events in Vietnam with the progress of the conference."

    苏修集团完全暴露美帝帮凶面目
    苏裁军代表竟说苏美谈判不受美帝轰炸河内的影响
    新华社二日讯　在美国进一步扩大战争，悍然轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内和海防以后，苏联出席日内瓦十七国裁军会议的代表罗申在向记者谈话中表示，这并不会影响苏联同美国就裁军问题继续谈判并达成协议。这再次暴露了苏联领导集团是美国“以炸逼和”阴谋的帮凶。据路透社六月三十日一条发自日内瓦的消息说，有记者问罗申，“鉴于越南的最新事态的发展，他是否认为达成协议是可能的”。罗申说：“如果我们并不认为有这种可能性，我们就不会在这里了。”
    据这家通讯社报道，罗申在这一天的裁军会议上尽管对美国的轰炸表示了“抗议”，“但是他没有把越南的事件同（裁军）会议的进展联系起来”。
