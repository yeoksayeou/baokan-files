	Chairman Mao's Quotations

	People will always die, but the meaning of death differs. ... To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai; to work for the fascists, to die for the exploiters and oppressors of the people, is lighter than a feather.		_In Memory of Norman Bethune_

    毛主席语录
    人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。……为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。		《为人民服务》
