	Highly Raise the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought
	Open Fire on the Literary and Artistic Black Line Led by Zhou Yang
	—Excerpts from Big-Character Posters—

	Editor's Note: The big-character posters published today further expose the shameful crimes of Zhou Yang, the ringleader of the literary and artistic black line. With the most vicious language and the most despicable methods, he slanders, strikes, and suppresses revolutionary songs; he fiercely obstructs and restricts the publication of popular readings that serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers; he strenuously opposes running schools according to the educational policies of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and opposes inheriting and carrying forward the revolutionary traditions of our Party and army's performing troupes and teams. In short, whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, and whatever is beneficial to the workers, peasants, and soldiers and loved by them, he opposes.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." In our struggle against the literary and artistic black line led by Zhou Yang, we should follow Chairman Mao's teaching, confront them head-on, and "do the opposite of what they do." We must highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly adhere to the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics. The heinous crimes committed by the Zhou Yang gang against the people must be thoroughly settled!

	What Does Zhou Yang's Fierce Opposition to Revolutionary Songs Mean?
	—Excerpt from a Big-Character Poster by the Central National Orchestra—

	Revolutionary songs are powerful weapons for uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy. Comrade Lin Biao said: "Teaching a good song is actually an important political class and also a cultural class."

	However, Zhou Yang harbors extreme hostility towards revolutionary songs. He uses the most vicious language and the most despicable methods to slander, suppress, and strangle revolutionary songs.

	We sing "The East Is Red, the Sun Rises," and "Mao Zedong Thought is the Sun That Never Sets," but Zhou Yang slanders these songs as "clichéd slogans."

	We praise the people's communes and the Three Red Banners, but Zhou Yang maliciously says, "You can't use the resolutions of the people's communes for choral singing."

	We joyfully sing "The Sky in the Liberated Areas Is Bright," but Zhou Yang gnashes his teeth and says, "The sky in the liberated areas has no cloudy days?"

	As long as it is a revolutionary song, Zhou Yang opposes and suppresses it. The song Zhou Yang curses the most fiercely and strikes the hardest is the revolutionary song "Socialism Is Good."

	"Socialism Is Good" was created in 1957 to counter the rampant attacks of the bourgeois rightists. As soon as the song was written, it immediately faced strong resistance from the Zhou Yang gang. The newspapers they controlled did not publish it, so we had to print it on oil paper and distribute it. After a long time, when the revolutionary masses sang "Socialism Is Good" to fiercely attack the bourgeois rightists, the song was finally published. We want to ask the Zhou Yang gang, when the bourgeois rightists were rampantly attacking the Party and socialism, you were so elated and opened the door wide, but when we counterattacked the bourgeois rightists, why did you put on a stern face like the King of Hell and deprive us of our right to speak? Isn't this openly colluding with the bourgeois rightists and implementing dictatorship over the proletariat?

	The Zhou Yang gang's plot to prevent the publication of this revolutionary song did not succeed, but their hearts are not dead. After this song became popular among the masses, they maliciously slandered and struck at it for a long time. In this regard, Zhou Yang has many malicious words and ruthless methods. Now we list a few and expose them to the public, so everyone can see Zhou Yang's ugly face.

	Zhou Yang sneered, "Socialism is good, socialism is good, you sing a few times and socialism is good? Ha ha!" From these few words, it is clear that Zhou Yang harbors deep hatred for socialism and harbors an enemy attitude towards the masses singing revolutionary songs. A malicious sneer contains his deep hatred. We must warn Zhou Yang: Socialism is good, and you can't curse it down. We will definitely praise the Party and praise socialism!

	Zhou Yang fiercely shouted, "'Socialism Is Good,' during parades, it's okay to shout slogans, but you can't say 'Socialism Is Good' all the time! You can't say 'Thank the Communist Party, thank Chairman Mao' all the time!" We want to ask Zhou Yang: What's wrong with socialism? If we don't thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, who should we thank? You want to seal our mouths, not let us praise the Communist Party, not let us praise socialism, not let us praise the great leader Chairman Mao, this is absolutely impossible, a million times impossible!

	Zhou Yang insidiously said, "The writers of the 1930s had strong revolutionary passion and were very clear about what kind of enemy to oppose. But in the socialist revolutionary period today, it is not so clear what kind of enemy to oppose, so there is a lack of moving works and passionate emotions like then, so songs like 'Socialism Is Good' appear." In Zhou Yang's eyes, the bourgeois literature of the 1930s is very good, extremely wonderful; on the contrary, proletarian literature is very bad, really unacceptable. He tries to use the bourgeois literature of the 1930s to reform our proletarian literature, turning our literature into bourgeois literature, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. The Zhou Yang gang's intentions are so malicious!

	Zhou Yang also insidiously incited, "Anger is the driving force. 'The Yellow River Cantata' has anger, but 'Socialism Is Good' does not have the passion and indignation of 'The Yellow River Cantata'." Zhou Yang, what kind of "anger" do you want? Is it the counter-revolutionary sentiment in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"? Then you definitely won't find it in "Socialism Is Good." We believe that "Socialism Is Good" has a clear class hatred. This love is the boundless love of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for the Party, Chairman Mao, and socialism; this hatred is the strong hatred of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for the bourgeois rightists, imperialism, and all reactionaries. When billions of workers, peasants, and soldiers sing this song to counterattack the bourgeois rightists, you, the enemies of socialism, are afraid, trembling, and thus shouting to cover up your fear.

	What "passion," what "anger," all are malicious words. While Zhou Yang is erasing "Socialism Is Good," he takes the opportunity to talk about how "anger is the driving force," but he is just trying to incite a small group of people with ulterior motives to rise up against the Party, against the proletarian dictatorship, and against socialism!

	Since 1957, the Zhou Yang gang has cursed, suppressed, and struck at "Socialism Is Good" for seven years, until the "Red Flag" magazine republished this song in 1965, they were forced to stop. During these seven years, the Zhou Yang gang would say one time that this song is wrong, and another time that this song is no good, using every possible means to try to strangle it, with a determination to never coexist. Let us tell you, Zhou Yang gang, our struggle with you is not just a struggle over one song, but a struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, a struggle between supporting socialism and opposing socialism. You want to oppose the proletarian dictatorship of the socialist state, you can't; you want to overthrow proletarian revolutionary songs, you can't. The more you oppose socialism, the more we will firmly defend socialism; the more you oppose "Socialism Is Good," the more we will sing this revolutionary song. Zhou Yang gang, listen: "Socialism is good, socialism is good! The socialist state is protected by the people; the people's state is firmly seated, and the reactionaries want to rebel but can't. The socialist society will definitely be victorious, and the communist society will definitely come!"

### 周扬疯狂反对革命歌曲意味着什么？——选自中央民族乐团的大字报

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
　　向以周扬为首的文艺黑线开火
　　——大字报选——
    编者按：今天发表的几张大字报，从不同的侧面进一步揭露了周扬这个文艺黑线总头目的可耻罪行。他用最恶毒的语言，最卑鄙的手段，诬蔑、打击和扼杀革命歌曲；他疯狂地阻挠和限制出版为工农兵服务的通俗读物；他竭力反对按照党中央和毛主席的教育方针办学校，反对继承和发扬我党我军文工团、队的革命传统……。一句话，凡是符合毛泽东思想的，凡是有益于工农兵群众并为他们所喜爱的，他都反对。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们跟以周扬为首的文艺黑线的斗争，就应当遵循毛主席的这一教导，针锋相对，“反其道而行之”。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持文艺为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的方向。周扬黑帮对人民犯下的滔天罪行，我们一定要彻底清算！
　　周扬疯狂反对革命歌曲意味着什么？
　　——选自中央民族乐团的大字报
    革命歌曲是团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器。林彪同志说：“教一个好的歌子，实际上也是一堂重要的政治课，又是文化课。”
    然而，周扬对革命歌曲却极端仇视。他用最恶毒的语言，最卑鄙的手段，诬蔑、压制和扼杀革命歌曲。
    我们高唱“东方红，太阳升”，高唱“毛泽东思想是不落的太阳”，周扬却诬蔑这些歌曲是“千篇一律”的“标语口号”。
    我们歌颂人民公社，歌颂三面红旗，周扬却恶毒地说：“不能用人民公社的决议搞合唱。”
    我们欢欣鼓舞地唱“解放区的天是明朗的天”，周扬却咬牙切齿地说：“解放区的天就没有阴天？”
    只要是革命歌曲，周扬一概反对，一概压制。而周扬咒骂得最凶，打击得最狠的，是革命歌曲《社会主义好》。
    《社会主义好》是一九五七年为反击资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻而创作的。歌曲一写成，立即遭到了周扬黑帮的强烈抵制。他们控制的报刊，不予发表，因而我们只好油印成歌篇向外散发。过了好久，当革命群众高唱《社会主义好》向资产阶级右派猛烈开火的时候，才刊登了这首歌曲。我们要质问周扬黑帮，在资产阶级右派向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的时候，你们是那样的兴高采烈，大开方便之门，而当我们向资产阶级右派反击的时候，为什么你们却板起一副阎王爷的面孔，剥夺我们的发言权？这不是公然与资产阶级右派串通一气，向无产阶级实行专政，又是什么呢？
    周扬黑帮不让这首革命歌曲发表的阴谋没有得逞，但是他们的心不死。当这首歌在广大群众中唱开之后，他们长时期地、不择手段地诬蔑和打击这首歌曲。在这方面，周扬的黑话很多，手段很辣。现在列出几条，公布示众，让大家看看周扬的丑恶嘴脸。
    周扬冷嘲热讽地说：“社会主义好，社会主义好，你们唱那么几遍社会主义就好啦？呵呵！”从这几句话里可以清楚地看到，周扬对社会主义怀有刻骨的仇恨，对群众高唱革命歌曲，抱着敌视的态度。一声阴毒的冷笑，包含着他的几多仇恨。我们要正告周扬：社会主义就是好，你骂是骂不倒的，我们一定要歌颂党，歌颂社会主义！
    周扬恶狠狠地叫嚷道：“‘社会主义好’，在游行的时候，喊喊口号是可以的，但不能什么时候都说‘社会主义好’啊！不能什么时候都喊感谢共产党，感谢毛主席啊！”我们要质问周扬：社会主义有什么不好呢？我们不感谢共产党，不感谢毛主席，又感谢谁呢？你想封住我们的口，不让我们歌颂共产党，不让我们歌颂社会主义，不让我们歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席，这一千个办不到，一万个办不到！
    周扬别有用心地说：“三十年代的作家，都有强烈的革命激情，对于应该反对什么样的敌人，都很清楚。而今天社会主义革命时期，对于应该反对什么样的敌人，却不那么清楚，因此就缺少象那时那样动人的作品，缺少激动的感情，所以出现了象《社会主义好》这样的歌曲。”在周扬看来，三十年代的资产阶级文艺好得很，无比的美妙；相反，无产阶级的文艺却糟得很，实在要不得。他企图用三十年代的资产阶级文艺来改造我们无产阶级的文艺，把我们的文艺变为资产阶级的文艺，为资本主义复辟准备舆论。周扬黑帮的用心多么恶毒！
    周扬还别有用心地煽动道：“愤怒是动力。《黄河大合唱》有愤怒，《社会主义好》却没有《黄河大合唱》那样的热情、义愤。”周扬，你要的是什么样的“愤怒”呢？是《海瑞上疏》里那样的反革命的情绪吗？那么《社会主义好》里你肯定是找不到的。我们认为《社会主义好》是有鲜明的阶级爱憎的。这种爱，是广大工农兵群众对党对毛主席对社会主义无比的热爱；这种恨，是广大工农兵群众对资产阶级右派、对帝国主义和一切反动派强烈的憎恨。当亿万工农兵唱着这首歌曲向资产阶级右派反击的时候，你们这些社会主义的敌人害怕了，发抖了，因而发出这样的叫嚣，来掩饰你们的恐惧。
    什么“激情”，什么“愤怒”，统统是黑话。周扬在抹煞《社会主义好》的同时，借题发挥，大谈什么“愤怒是动力”，不过是想煽动一小撮心怀叵测的人起来反对党，反对无产阶级专政，反对社会主义！
    从一九五七年以来，周扬黑帮对《社会主义好》的咒骂、压制、打击，前后达七年之久，一直到一九六五年《红旗》杂志重新发表这首歌曲之后，才被迫收敛。这七年中，周扬黑帮一忽儿说这首歌怎样不对，一忽儿又说这首歌怎样不行，千方百计想把它扼杀掉，大有不共戴天之势。告诉你，周扬黑帮，我们与你们的斗争，不仅是一首歌的斗争，而是革命与反革命的斗争，是拥护社会主义还是反对社会主义的斗争。你们想反对无产阶级专政的社会主义江山，是反对不了的，你们想打倒无产阶级革命歌曲，是打倒不了的。你们越是反对社会主义，我们越要牢牢地保卫社会主义；你们越是反对《社会主义好》，我们越要高唱这首革命歌曲。周扬黑帮听着：“社会主义好，社会主义好！社会主义江山人民保；人民江山坐得牢，反动派想反也反不了。社会主义社会一定胜利，共产主义社会一定来到！”
