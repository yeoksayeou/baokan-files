	The Canary Islands representative Antonio Cubillo today at the emergency meeting of the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference said that Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth, and that Comrade Mao Zedong has developed Marxism-Leninism, making China the helmsman of the world revolutionary movement and the standard-bearer of the laboring people's victorious struggle. All of Chairman Mao's revolutionary thoughts are for the happiness of the Chinese and the world's peoples.

	Cubillo, in his speech, represented the people and writers of the Canary Islands, which are still under Spanish colonial rule, and the Canary Islands' nationalist organizations, expressing their high respect to writers from various countries.

	Cubillo, in his speech, expressed his highest respect to the great leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Chairman Liu Shaoqi. He said that the Chinese Communist Party is the standard-bearer of world socialism, the inheritor of the doctrines of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, and the initiator of the miraculous changes of the Chinese people under the banner of Marxism-Leninism.

	He said with great enthusiasm that Chairman Mao Zedong is a great poet and a great revolutionary. He has turned all the hopes and revolutionary thoughts for the happiness of the Chinese and the world's peoples into living realities.

	In discussing the Vietnam issue, he said that the Vietnamese people today have become a model of selfless heroism and sacrifice for all revolutionaries in the world. We regard this emergency conference as a great manifestation of the Permanent Bureau's support for the work of the Vietnamese people and their revolutionary loyalty.

	He finally, on behalf of the Canary Islands' nationalist organizations, condemned all so-called "peace talks" that attempt to save face for the United States and go against the fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people.
