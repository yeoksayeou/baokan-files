Our country's vast militia resolutely support the stern warning issued by our country's government on July 3rd to the American imperialists.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 8th, the vast militia of our country most resolutely support the stern warning issued by our country's government on July 3rd to the American imperialists.

From Hainan Island, which is opposite Vietnam across the sea, to the banks of the Red River on the China-Vietnam border, and to the northern city of Harbin, the vast militia have been holding meetings in recent days, strongly condemning the American imperialists' new acts of aggression and war of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. They warned the American imperialists at the meetings: The hundreds of millions of militia in China have made all preparations to oppose the American imperialists' aggression. No matter where the American imperialists expand the war, the hundreds of millions of militia in China will spare no effort to firmly support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end. They pointed out that if this leads to the American imperialists invading China, then we welcome it to come sooner, and we will, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, burn this wild cow of American imperialism in the fire of people's war sooner.

The militia also enthusiastically applauded the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their counterattacks against the American imperialists' aggression. They pointed out that Chairman Mao had long ago pointed out that American imperialism is a paper tiger, and this paper tiger has now revealed its true colors in Vietnam. The heroic Vietnamese people will surely achieve a thorough victory in the anti-aggression war.

The more than 2,000 militia members of the state-owned South China Fisheries Company on the coast of the Beibu Gulf in northern Hainan Island held meetings on fishing boats and at the docks. At sea, militia member Yu Guicheng said, "Our government's statement represents the firm will of our country's 700 million people to support Vietnam and resist America. Vietnam is our neighboring country with which we share a common fate. The United States' aggression against Vietnam is a prelude to aggression against our country, and we cannot stand idly by. We, more than 2,000 militia members, are ready at any time to contribute our greatest efforts to support the Vietnamese people."

In Yunnan Province, from the banks of the Red River on the China-Vietnam border to the foothills of the Great Snow Mountains in the northwest, the militia held meetings to support the Vietnamese people. The militia in Hekou Yao Autonomous County, which shares mountains and rivers with the Vietnamese people, unanimously expressed at the condemnation meeting that under the education of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people, holding high the banner of proletarian internationalism, most resolutely stand with the 31 million Vietnamese people.

In the frontline cities of Fuzhou and Xiamen facing Haiphong, male and female militia members held meetings in the rain in recent days. They sternly warned the American imperialists: You have no limits in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, and we have no limits in opposing aggression and supporting Vietnam to resist America. We, the frontline militia armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have rich experience in fighting the enemy. We are in the fields and factories, keeping an eye on your thieves' claws, ready to support the Vietnamese people at any time.

In Shanxi Province, the entire militia of the "Liu Huilan" militia squad in Yunzhouxi Village, Wenxian County, expressed that they could not sit idly by and watch the American imperialists brazenly bomb Hanoi and Haiphong, which is extremely barbaric and rampant. The militia in Changxing Commune, Hukou County, the revolutionary old base area of the Taihang Mountains, also held meetings immediately after hearing the news of the American planes bombing Hanoi and Haiphong.

At the First Automobile Works in Changchun, the excellent worker and militia member Shao Guozhong said at a meeting in the factory, "Automobile workers will, like the people of the entire country, firmly support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end until we drive out all the American aggressors from Vietnam and achieve the final victory."

In Zhengzhou, Liu Peide, a representative of the National Militia Congress and deputy platoon leader of the militia from Zhengzhou Diesel Engine Factory, was extremely angry about the American imperialists' rampant bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong. He said, "We must study Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war well, train our skills to fight the enemy, and be prepared to give the American aggressors a heavy blow."

The militia in the mountain city of Guiyang strongly condemned the extremely rampant war actions of the American bandits.

In Hangzhou, the militia of Meijiawu Production Brigade in Xihu Commune, who had received many visits from Vietnamese friends in the past few years, expressed at the meeting that all 700 million people in China stand with the Vietnamese people, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

In the northern city of Harbin, part of the militia of Harbin Normal University held a condemnation meeting immediately after hearing the news of the American bandits' continuous bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.
