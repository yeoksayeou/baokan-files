Vice Premier Chen Yi tonight strongly condemned the "joint action" of U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Indian reactionaries in pushing the big conspiracy of "bombing to force peace" on the Vietnamese issue.

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the so-called seven-point proposal for "peace" in Vietnam, hastily thrown out by the Indian government, "is an outright proposal serving the purpose of the United States continuing to occupy South Vietnam and permanently splitting Vietnam." He also pointed out, "The fate of U.S. imperialism's complete failure in Vietnam is predestined. All the ghosts and demons serving it will not have a good ending."

Vice Premier Chen Yi made these remarks at a banquet held by the acting charge d'affaires of the Korean Embassy in China, Kim Jae-suk, to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Korean Friendship Cooperation Mutual Assistance Treaty.

He said: "The U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong shows that the Johnson administration is at a loss in the war of aggression against Vietnam, desperately trying to use the military blackmail of escalating air raids to force the Vietnamese people to surrender and accept the 'peace talks' fraud. As expected, those who have always been running around for the 'peace talks' fraud have become very active again in coordination with the U.S. imperialists' mad bombing. The Indian government has hastily thrown out the so-called seven-point proposal for 'peace' in Vietnam. The 'joint action' of U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Indian reactionaries in pushing the big conspiracy of 'bombing to force peace' has finally been exposed in broad daylight."

He said: "What kind of goods is the Indian government's proposal? It is a replica of the so-called unconditional negotiations that the United States has been shouting about all along. It is a proposal that, under the banner of the Geneva Agreement, completely violates the Geneva Agreement. It ignores the clear provisions of the Geneva Agreement and does not demand that the United States immediately stop its aggression against the entire Vietnam and immediately withdraw all its troops of aggression from South Vietnam. It puts the aggressor and the victim of aggression on an equal footing, demanding that the Vietnamese people negotiate with the American bandits while the U.S. troops of aggression are still in Vietnam. This is an outright proposal serving the purpose of the United States continuing to occupy South Vietnam and permanently splitting Vietnam."

He stressed: "In the situation where U.S. imperialism refuses to withdraw all its troops of aggression and is escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam, to peddle any form of 'peace talks' can only be to sell out the interests of the Vietnamese people and serve U.S. imperialism. The Vietnamese people will not agree, and the revolutionary people of the whole world will not agree. The fate of U.S. imperialism's complete failure in Vietnam is predestined. All the ghosts and demons serving it will not have a good ending. The Chinese people will continue to stand with the Korean people and all the revolutionary people of the world to fully support the great struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression and for national salvation until they achieve final victory."

Vice Premier Chen Yi also said: "The U.S. imperialists brazenly bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the second largest city, Haiphong, escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam to a more serious stage. The new crime of U.S. imperialism's escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam has aroused the extreme indignation of the Vietnamese people, the Korean people, the Chinese people, and all the revolutionary people of the world. The people of the world see more clearly the ugly face of U.S. imperialism and are launching an unprecedentedly powerful wave of anti-U.S. and aid-Vietnam struggle."

　　陈毅副总理揭露印度反动派配合美帝狂轰滥炸抛出所谓“和平”建议
　　强烈谴责美苏印推行“以炸迫和”的大阴谋
　　兜售任何方式的“和平谈判”，只能是出卖越南人民的利益，为美帝国主义效劳
　　美帝在越南彻底失败的命运已经注定，为它效劳的一切牛鬼蛇神决不会有好下场
    新华社十二日讯　陈毅副总理今晚强烈谴责美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和印度反动派“联合行动”，正在越南问题上推行“以炸迫和”的大阴谋。
    陈毅副总理指出，印度政府迫不及待地抛出的所谓在越南实现“和平”的七点建议，“是一个不折不扣地为美国继续霸占南越、永远分裂越南的目的服务的建议”。他还指出，“美帝国主义在越南彻底失败的命运，是注定了的。为它效劳的一切牛鬼蛇神也决不会有好下场”。
    陈毅副总理是在朝鲜驻中国大使馆临时代办金在淑为庆祝中朝友好合作互助条约签订五周年而举行的宴会上讲这些话的。
    他说：“美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防，表明约翰逊政府在侵略越南战争中走投无路，妄想用扩大空袭的军事讹诈，来迫使越南人民屈服，接受‘和谈’骗局。果然，同美帝国主义的狂轰滥炸相配合，历来为‘和谈’骗局奔走的人，又大肆活跃起来。印度政府迫不及待地抛出了所谓在越南实现‘和平’的七点建议。美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和印度反动派‘联合行动’，推行‘以炸迫和’的大阴谋，终于暴露在光天化日之下。”
    他说：“印度政府的建议，究竟是什么样的货色呢？它是美国一直叫嚷的所谓无条件谈判的建议的翻版。它是打着日内瓦协议旗帜，彻底违反日内瓦协议的建议。它无视日内瓦协议的明确规定，根本没有要求美国立即停止对整个越南的侵略，没有要求美国立即从南越撤出它的全部侵略军队。它把侵略者和侵略的受害者摆在同等地位，要求越南人民在美国侵略军还留在越南国土上的时候，就同美国强盗谈判。这是一个不折不扣地为美国继续霸占南越、永远分裂越南的目的服务的建议。”
    他强调指出：“在美帝国主义拒绝全部撤退它的侵略军队、加紧扩大侵略越南战争的情况下，兜售任何方式的‘和平谈判’，只能是出卖越南人民的利益，为美帝国主义效劳。越南人民不会答应，全世界的革命人民也不会答应。美帝国主义在越南彻底失败的命运，是注定了的。为它效劳的一切牛鬼蛇神也决不会有好下场。中国人民将继续同朝鲜人民和全世界一切革命的人民一道，全力支持越南人民伟大的抗美救国斗争，直到他们取得最后的胜利。”
    陈毅副总理还说：“美帝国主义悍然轰炸越南民主共和国的首都河内和第二大城市海防，把侵略越南的战争上升到一个更加严重的阶段。美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的新罪行，激起了越南人民、朝鲜人民、中国人民和全世界一切革命人民的无比愤怒。全世界人民更加看清了美帝国主义的狰狞面目，正在掀起一个声势空前浩大的反美援越的斗争浪潮。”
