In view of the fact that the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference can no longer be held in Indonesia, the emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers held in Beijing from June 27 to July 9, 1966, endorses the proposal by the Indonesian delegation that the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference be held in China.

The meeting entrusts the Permanent Bureau of Afro-Asian Writers with the task of negotiating with the host country to make specific arrangements for this conference.

The meeting appreciates the valuable contributions made by the progressive writers of Indonesia in this regard.

    关于第三届亚非作家大会的决议
    鉴于第三届亚非作家大会已不再可能在印度尼西亚举行，一九六六年六月二十七日至七月九日在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议赞同印度尼西亚代表团提出的第三届亚非作家大会在中国举行的建议。
    会议委托亚非作家常设局承担与东道国协商进行有关这次大会的具体安排的任务。
    会议赞赏印度尼西亚进步作家在这方面所作出的宝贵的贡献。
