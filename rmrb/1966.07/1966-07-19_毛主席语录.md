	We must all learn from his spirit of complete selflessness. From this point on, we can become people who are greatly beneficial to the people. A person's abilities may vary in size, but as long as they have this spirit, they are a person of noble character, a person of purity, a person of morality, a person who has risen above vulgar interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people.

　　毛主席语录
    我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。
                                         《纪念白求恩》
