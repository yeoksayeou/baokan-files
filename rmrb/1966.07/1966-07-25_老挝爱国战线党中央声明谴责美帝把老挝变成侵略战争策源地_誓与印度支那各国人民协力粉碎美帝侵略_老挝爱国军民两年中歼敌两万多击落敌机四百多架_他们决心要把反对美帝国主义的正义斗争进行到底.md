The Central Committee of the Lao People's Party issued a statement on July 23, the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Agreement on the Laos issue, strongly denouncing and condemning the U.S. imperialists for deliberately sabotaging the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos and attempting to turn Laos into a base for aggressive war.

This statement was signed by Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao People's Party.

The statement warned: "If the U.S. government and its followers blindly continue down the path of aggression and war, the Lao People's Party and the entire Lao people, in order to thwart the aggressive intentions of U.S. imperialism and to liberate the entire country, will take all necessary measures to counterattack. The Lao people are determined to unite and, together with the peoples of the Indochina countries, to join forces in the struggle to foil all the evil schemes of U.S. imperialism, to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Indochina countries, and to contribute to the maintenance of peace in Asia and the world."

The statement exposed the recent U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam and Laos, as well as the intensified military provocations and threats against Cambodia. It also pointed out that the U.S. is actively preparing to bring American ground troops into Laos to fight. The statement said that this is a shameless new military adventure, which will not only escalate the war in Laos but also spread the flames of war throughout Southeast Asia.

The statement said: "The U.S. imperialists must understand that such actions will only strengthen the mutual support and cooperation of the peoples of Indochina in their struggle to foil all the evil schemes of U.S. imperialism, and will only strengthen the support and assistance of the peoples of Asia in their defense of peace in this region of the world. The consequences of the actions of U.S. imperialism are unpredictable, and the U.S. imperialists must bear full responsibility for their actions." The statement also said: "The lackeys and servants who are firmly attached to U.S. imperialism, especially the reactionary leaders of Bangkok who have sold their country to the Americans and are willing to let the Americans turn their country into a springboard for aggression against the Indochina countries, will not escape the punishment of the peoples of this region."

The statement said that over the past four years, U.S. imperialism has continuously sent military personnel and mercenary troops into Laos (with over 5,000 American advisors alone, most of whom are disguised as soldiers). It has continuously increased the supply of weapons, ammunition, and military equipment to the right-wing forces in Laos, expanding their army from 40,000 to 70,000; it has continuously built and expanded numerous warehouses, airfields, and strategic roads, especially in the Vientiane area and central and southern Laos, inciting its mercenaries to launch hundreds of incursions of various scales over the past four years, in many of which dozens of battalions of troops were deployed, supported by artillery and air force, and with the participation of Thai troops, in an attempt to occupy the liberated areas.

Under the control of U.S. imperialism, its lackeys have disrupted the economy and finance in the areas they control, making the lives of the people there uncertain from day to day. In the areas under its control, it implements extremely reactionary policies of suppressing the people.

The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism has sabotaged the negotiations among the three parties in Laos and shifted the responsibility for the stalemate in the negotiations to the Lao People's Party.

The statement said that the most serious thing is that since May 17, 1964, the Johnson administration, in collusion with Prince Souvanna Phouma, has brazenly dispatched air forces from the U.S. Seventh Fleet and from its bases in Thailand and South Vietnam to carry out barbaric, round-the-clock bombing of the liberated areas. This bloody crime has thoroughly exposed the imperialist nature of the Washington ruling clique, its extremely base and inhuman nature as bandits, and its true nature as the most dangerous war criminals.

The statement pointed out that Prince Souvanna Phouma, as an accomplice in the above-mentioned evil deeds of U.S. imperialism, has committed the heinous crime of inviting the wolf into the house, a crime that will be recorded in history and exposed before public opinion, thus exposing his false "neutralism" and "nationalism."

The statement said that in summary, the interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism over the past four years—indeed, over the past twelve years—is the fundamental cause of the current renewed tensions in Laos.

The statement pointed out that the Indian and Canadian members of the International Control Commission in Laos, who are manipulated by U.S. imperialism, shamelessly sabotaged the Geneva Agreement and seriously infringed upon the sovereignty of Laos. They have turned the International Control Commission in Laos into an instrument aimed at sheltering and aiding U.S. imperialism in its war of aggression.

The statement said that the U.S. imperialists intend to use force to subdue the Lao people and seize Laos. This is definitely not possible. Over the past four years, the Lao people and the Lao patriotic forces have foiled all the attacks of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, whether on the ground or in the air. In the past two years alone, the Lao People's Liberation Army and the patriotic neutral armed forces, with the support and cooperation of the people, have annihilated more than 20,000 enemy troops, shot down more than 400 U.S. and mercenary planes, captured a large number of U.S. bandits and their lackeys, and defended and consolidated the liberated areas, which cover two-thirds of the national territory and half of the Lao population. The unity of the Lao people has been strengthened.

The statement firmly demands that the U.S. government stop its war of aggression against Laos, withdraw all U.S. military personnel, weapons, ammunition, and war materials, as well as the military personnel and troops of its mercenaries from Laos, and allow the Lao people to solve their own problems. It also demands an immediate halt to all bombings of the liberated areas.

The statement calls on the Lao patriotic military and people to unite more closely, heighten vigilance, and be prepared to foil all the evil schemes and actions of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys at any time.

The statement appeals to the peoples and governments of Asian countries and to all peace-loving peoples and organizations around the world, for the sake of peace and justice, to strengthen their heartfelt support and assistance to the Lao people in their just struggle against U.S. imperialism and to save the nation, and to timely stop the evil schemes of U.S. imperialism against the Lao people.

The statement finally emphasizes: "The Lao patriotic military and people are determined to carry out the glorious and just struggle against U.S. imperialism and to save the nation to the end. Believing in the invincible power of national unity and the support and assistance of all friends and progressive humanity around the world, the Lao people will surely make the U.S. imperialist aggressors suffer a thorough defeat and will surely win the final victory."

    老挝爱国战线党中央声明谴责美帝把老挝变成侵略战争策源地
    誓与印度支那各国人民协力粉碎美帝侵略
    老挝爱国军民两年中歼敌两万多击落敌机四百多架
    他们决心要把反对美帝国主义的正义斗争进行到底
    新华社康开二十三日电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会就关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议签订四周年（七月二十三日）发表声明，强烈控诉和谴责美帝国主义有计划地破坏了一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，并且企图把老挝变成侵略战争的策源地。
    这个声明是由老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王签署的。
    声明警告说：“如果美国政府及其追随者盲目地在侵略和战争的罪恶道路上走下去，那么老挝爱国战线党和全体老挝人民，为了粉碎美帝国主义的侵略目的，为了解放全部国土，将采取一切适当的措施予以反击。老挝人民决心团结起来，并且同印度支那各国人民紧密地协力进行斗争，来挫败美帝国主义的一切险恶图谋，以便保卫印度支那各国的独立和主权，从而为维护亚洲和世界和平作出贡献。”
    声明揭露美帝国主义最近在越南、老挝扩大侵略行动，并且加紧向柬埔寨进行军事挑衅和恫吓，还积极准备把美国地面部队引进老挝参战。声明指出，这是一个极其无耻的新的军事冒险，它不仅会加剧老挝战争，而且会把战火扩大到整个东南亚。
    声明说：“美帝国主义者必须懂得，这种行动只会加强印度支那各国人民的战斗的相互支援和合作，来粉碎美帝国主义者所有的险恶图谋，只会加强亚洲各国人民为捍卫世界这一地区的和平而给予他们的支持和援助。美帝国主义的行径的后果是难以预测的，美帝国主义者必须对他们的行动负全部责任。”声明还说：“死死依附美帝国主义者的走狗和仆从，特别是把自己的国家出卖给美国的曼谷的反动领导人，甘愿让美国把他们的国家变成侵略印度支那各国的跳板，这些人决不能逃脱这一地区的各国人民的惩罚。”
    声明说，四年来，美帝国主义不断地把军事人员和仆从的军事人员和部队开进老挝（单单美国顾问就达五千多人，大部分是伪装起来的军人）。它不断加紧向老挝右派提供武器、弹药和军事装备，使右派军队从四万人增为七万人；不断大力建立和扩建许多仓库、机场和战略公路，特别是在万象地区和中下寮，唆使它的雇佣军四年来进行了数百次各种规模的蚕食进攻，在其中许多次战斗中出动了几十个营的军队，配有炮兵和空军，并有泰国军队参加，妄图侵占解放区。
    美帝国主义通过它豢养的一批卖国贼走狗，在其走狗统治区扰乱经济和财政，使那里的各阶层人民的生活朝不保夕。在它控制之下的地区推行镇压人民的极端反动的政策。
    声明指出，美帝国主义破坏老挝三方的谈判，并且把谈判陷入僵局的责任推在爱国战线党身上。
    声明说，十分严重的是，约翰逊政府自从一九六四年五月十七日以来，同富马亲王合谋，悍然派遣从美国第七舰队以及从它在泰国和南越的基地起飞的空军，夜以继日地对解放区进行野蛮的狂轰滥炸。这种血腥罪行彻底暴露了华盛顿统治集团的侵略成性的帝国主义卑鄙之极的真面目，它的野蛮的、灭绝人性的强盗本性和同野兽一样的最危险的战犯的真正本质。
    声明指出，富马亲王充当美帝国主义上述罪恶勾当的同谋，因而犯下了引狼入室的可恶罪行，这一罪行将被载入史册，而且在舆论面前揭穿了他的“中立主义”和“民族主义”的假招牌。
    声明说，总之，美帝国主义四年来——事实上是十二年以来所进行的干涉和侵略，是目前老挝重新出现紧张局势的根本原因。
    声明指出，老挝国际监督委员会中为美帝国主义所操纵的印度和加拿大委员，无耻地破坏了日内瓦协议，严重地侵犯了老挝主权。他们把老挝国际委员会变成了目的在于庇护和帮助美帝国主义进行侵略战争的工具。
    声明说，美帝国主义者打算用武力来压倒老挝人民和霸占老挝。这肯定是办不到的。在过去的四年中，老挝人民和老挝爱国力量粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗的一切进攻，不管是地面的还是空中的。单单在最近两年中，老挝人民解放军同爱国的中立武装力量，在人民的配合和支援下，已经歼灭了两万多敌军，击落了美国及其仆从的强盗飞机四百多架，俘虏了大批美国强盗及其走狗，保卫住和巩固了占全国土地三分之二和占老挝人口半数的解放区。老挝人民的团结加强了。
    声明坚决要求美国政府停止对老挝的侵略战争，从老挝撤走美国的一切军事人员、武器、弹药和战争物资以及美国的仆从的军事人员和军队，让老挝人民自己来解决自己的问题，并且立即停止对解放区的一切轰炸。
    声明号召老挝爱国军民更加紧密地团结起来，提高警惕，准备随时挫败美帝国主义及其走狗的一切罪恶企图和行动。
    声明呼吁亚洲各国人民和政府以及全世界爱好和平的人民和团体，为了和平与正义的利益，加强他们对老挝人民为反对美帝国主义和拯救国家而进行的正义斗争的衷心支持和支援，并且及时制止美帝国主义者反对老挝人民的罪恶企图。
    声明最后强调说：“老挝爱国军民下定决心要把反对美帝国主义和挽救国家的光荣的正义斗争进行到底。深信民族团结的不可战胜的力量，深信全世界一切朋友和进步人类支持和支援的老挝人民，必将使美帝国主义侵略者遭到彻底失败，必将赢得最后胜利。”
