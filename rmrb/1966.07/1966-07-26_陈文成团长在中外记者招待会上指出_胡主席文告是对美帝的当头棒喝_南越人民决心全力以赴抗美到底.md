Chen Wencheng, Head of the Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam Resident in China, said at a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists today that the 14 million people of South Vietnam enthusiastically respond to the call of the beloved leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Hu Zhiming, in his "Proclamation to All Compatriots," and are determined to fight to the end in the struggle to resist America and save the country.

Chen Wencheng said that the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on July 20, enthusiastically supporting Chairman Hu Zhiming's "Proclamation to All Compatriots." He said that Chairman Hu Zhiming's proclamation is a brilliant declaration of national salvation, fully embodying the iron will and sacred wishes of the entire Vietnamese people.

Chen Wencheng pointed out that the Vietnamese people have achieved tremendous victories in the struggle to resist America and save the country. The so-called "gradual escalation" policy of the American bandits has suffered a shameful failure, and they are now in a desperate situation.

Chen Wencheng denounced: The American imperialists continue to escalate the war of aggression, brazenly bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, attempting to intimidate the military and people of South Vietnam, and exerting "pressure" to force the Vietnamese people "to the negotiating table," to negotiate according to their absurd conditions. They repeat the same old lies about "peace talks," claiming to be ready to negotiate at any time and in any place, and dispatch their lackeys Wilson, Sato, Tito, and others to peddle the American "peace" scam, in order to cover up their crimes and deceive world public opinion.

Chen Wencheng emphasized that in this situation, Chairman Hu's call and the statement of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam are a wake-up call to American imperialism.

He said that the statement of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam shows the unshakable determination of the people of South Vietnam: All the people of South Vietnam and the liberation armed forces are determined to contribute all their material and spiritual strength to fulfill their duty to the motherland. The people of South Vietnam will not hesitate to make any sacrifice, no matter what the cost, to complete this task.

At the press conference, a documentary film titled "Flames of Dong Xoai" reflecting the great victories of the people of South Vietnam in their struggle to resist America and save the country was shown.

    陈文成团长在中外记者招待会上指出
    胡主席文告是对美帝的当头棒喝
    南越人民决心全力以赴抗美到底
    新华社二十五日讯　越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长陈文成今天在他举行的中外记者招待会上说，一千四百万越南南方人民热烈响应越南人民敬爱的领袖胡志明主席在《告全国同胞书》中发出的号召，决心全力以赴，把抗美救国斗争进行到底。
    陈文成说，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团七月二十日发表声明，热烈拥护胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》。他说，胡志明主席的文告，是一个闪耀着正义光辉的救国宣言，它最充分地体现了全越南人民钢铁般的意志和神圣的愿望。
    陈文成指出，越南人民在抗美救国斗争中，已经获得了无比重大的胜利。美国强盗的所谓“逐步升级”的政策遭到可耻失败，它正在陷于日暮途穷的困境。
    陈文成谴责说：美帝国主义继续扩大侵略战争，悍然轰炸河内和海防，妄图恫吓越南南方军民，施加“压力”来迫使越南人民“到谈判桌上来”，按照它们的荒谬条件进行谈判。它们重弹什么“和谈”、随时准备在任何时候和任何地方都可以进行“和谈”的骗人的陈词滥调，并且驱使它的爪牙威尔逊、佐藤、铁托……等等四出奔走，兜售美国的“和平”骗局，借以掩盖它的罪恶，欺骗世界舆论。
    陈文成强调说，在这种形势下，胡主席的号召和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团的声明，是对美帝国主义的当头棒喝。
    他说，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团的声明，表明了越南南方人民坚如磐石般的决心是：全体南方人民和解放武装力量决心献出自己的全部物质和精神力量来完成对祖国所承担的义务。南方人民决不惜任何牺牲，不管要付出多大代价，也要完成这一任务。
    在记者招待会上，放映了反映越南南方人民抗美救国斗争伟大胜利的纪录影片《东帅烈火》。
