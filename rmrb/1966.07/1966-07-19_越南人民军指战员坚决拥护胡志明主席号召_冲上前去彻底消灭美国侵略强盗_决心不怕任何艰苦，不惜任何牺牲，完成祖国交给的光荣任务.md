A certain anti-aircraft artillery company, which had the honor of being inspected by Chairman Ho, held a solemn meeting on their positions while carrying out their combat duties. They decided to immediately launch a campaign to respond to Chairman Ho's call, kill the enemy, and achieve merits. All soldiers and officers of the company unanimously expressed: "We will take heroes Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Dai Thuan as examples, bravely and tenaciously fight, and be ready at any time to shed the last drop of blood for the unification of the country and the defense of the capital, Hanoi. Even if only one person and one gun remain, we will continue to fight and annihilate all the American air pirates."
