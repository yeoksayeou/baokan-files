Praising Heroes

There are many "firsts" in the life of Liu Yingjun.

During a wild camp relocation, the first thing he did was to hang up a portrait of Chairman Mao, "so that comrades can see Chairman Mao every day."

Every day, no matter what he did, he always put studying Chairman Mao's works first. At night, after he repaired the holes in the window, he would read "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again.

When he served as an external tutor, the first time he spoke to the children, he talked about reading Chairman Mao's books.

When he wrote letters to his comrades and relatives, he also wrote Chairman Mao's quotations on the envelopes, so that the recipients would see Chairman Mao's words first.

This first, that first, ultimately, is because he had the greatest first in his heart: loving Chairman Mao first, and listening to Chairman Mao's words first!

Engraved in the Heart

Five Good Soldiers Liu Ping'an

Liu Yingjun, during his lifetime, wrote "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng" in his diary, on the wall, carved it on the handle of his hoe, and imprinted it in his heart, and put it into action.

He truly responded to Chairman Mao's great call and indeed did "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng"!

We also write it in our diaries, and on the walls. Some even carve it on their tools. These are certainly important. But, comparing ourselves to Liu Yingjun, we should ask ourselves: Have I deeply engraved Chairman Mao's words in my heart? Have I deeply engraved the image of the hero in my heart?

"Cannot Let Go"

Clerk Zhou Shengren

In a critical moment, Liu Yingjun tightly grasped the reins.

The crowd on the scene shouted urgently: "Let go, let go!" If he let go, he could escape danger.

But Liu Yingjun firmly replied: "Cannot let go, cannot let go!" Because he knew that if he let go, the six beloved children would be in danger.

What a "cannot let go"! These three words contain so much rich meaning! Here is the question of "when faced with a matter, think of others first"; here is the question of how to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people; and here is the question of "for whom to live and for whom to die." These three words are the most powerful answers from Mao Zedong Thought to this series of questions.

In revolutionary work and revolutionary struggles, the more difficult and challenging the times, the more we should remember the three golden words "cannot let go"!

Three "No's"

Certain Unit's Third and Fourth Squads Gao Yan

Liu Yingjun did good deeds with three "no's": first, do not leave a name; second, do not report; third, do not record.

We are not unfamiliar with these three "no's." Lei Feng also never left a name when doing good deeds. Wang Jie also had three "no's": do not reach out for honor, do not reach out for treatment, and do not reach out for material things.

Chairman Mao taught us to "completely selfless and dedicated to others." These three "no's" are precisely the embodiment of this noble communist ideological quality.

For those bourgeois gentlemen with "me" in their minds, they will never be able to do these three "no's," and they will never understand these three "no's."

We are revolutionary soldiers of the great Mao Zedong era. We must, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly answer with "no" in front of "me."

Beating Pulse

Soldier Zhang Xianyin

Liu Yingjun gloriously sacrificed himself for the people, and the doctor still felt his pulse, feeling that "the hero's pulse is still beating."

Yes, it is still beating, and it will beat forever!

Listen, his words of loving Chairman Mao are not being praised everywhere? Look, the spirit of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is not being learned by everyone? We feel not only his beating pulse, but also his footsteps, his image, his lofty thoughts. He will forever live among us.

Chairman Mao said: "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai." Mount Tai is eternal.

Let the revisionists' philosophy of survival go to hell! They may live a few more years, but their souls, their lives, have long been lost!

    赞英雄
    第一……
    战士  齐高赞
    刘英俊生活里有好多个“第一”。
    野营移防，他的第一件事，是把毛主席象挂起来，“让同志们天天看到毛主席”。
    他每天不论做什么事，都把学习毛主席著作放在第一位。夜里，他补好了窗上的洞，还要再读一遍《纪念白求恩》。
    他当校外辅导员，第一次给小朋友们讲话，讲的是要读毛主席的书。
    他给战友和亲属们写信，还在信封上写上毛主席语录，让收信人第一眼就看到毛主席的话。
    这第一，那第一，归根到底，是因为他心中有着一个最伟大的第一，那就是：热爱毛主席第一，听毛主席的话第一！
    刻在心上
    五好战士　刘平安
    刘英俊生前把“向雷锋同志学习”几个字，记在日记上，写在墙壁上，刻在锄柄上，印在心坎上，落在行动上。
    他是真正地响应了毛主席的伟大号召，确确实实地做到了“向雷锋同志学习”！
    我们也在日记上记，也在墙上写，有的也刻在工具上，这些当然都是重要的。但是，对照刘英俊，我们更应当问问自己：我是不是把毛主席的话深深地刻在心上了？是不是把英雄形象深深地刻在心上了？
    “不能撒”
    文书　周盛仁
    在紧急时刻，刘英俊紧紧抓住马缰绳。
    在场的群众急声高呼：“快撒手，快撒手！”只要一撒手，他就可以脱离险境。
    但是，刘英俊坚定地回答：“不能撒，不能撒！”因为他知道，只要一撒手，那六个可爱的孩子就有生命危险。
    好一个“不能撒”！这三个字里包含着多么丰富的内容啊！这里有“一事当前，先替谁打算”的问题；有怎样才算是“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务的问题，还有“为谁而生，为谁而死”的问题。这三个字，是用毛泽东思想对这一系列问题最有力的回答。
    在革命工作中，在革命斗争中，越是艰难困苦的时候，我们不是越要记住“不能撒”这三个金光闪闪的大字吗！
    三个“不”字
    某部三四分队　高言
    刘英俊做好事有三个“不”：一不留姓名，二不汇报，三不记载。
    对这三个“不”，我们并不陌生。雷锋做好事也是从来不留姓名的。王杰也有个三不伸手：在荣誉上不伸手，在待遇上不伸手，在物质上不伸手。
    毛主席教导我们，要“毫不利己专门利人”。三个“不”字，正是这种崇高的共产主义思想品质的体现。
    对于那些满脑子“我”字的资产阶级老爷们来说，他们永远做不到这三个“不”字，也永远不能理解这三个“不”字。
    我们是伟大毛泽东时代的革命战士，我们要按照毛主席的教导，在“我”字面前，永远坚定地用“不”字来回答。
    跳动的脉搏
    战士　张显印
    刘英俊为人民光荣地牺牲了，大夫还按着他的脉搏，觉得“英雄的脉搏还在跳动”。
    是的，还在跳动，并且将永远跳动！
    你听，他热爱毛主席的话语，不是到处在传颂吗？你看，他活学活用毛主席著作的精神，不是大家都在学习吗？我们感受到的，不仅是他跳动的脉搏，而且是他的脚步，他的形象，他崇高的思想。他，永远活在我们中间。
    毛主席说：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。泰山是永世长存的。
    让修正主义分子那一套活命哲学见鬼去吧！他们也许多活几年，但是，他们的灵魂，他们的生命，早已丧失净尽了！　（原载二十一日《解放军报》）
