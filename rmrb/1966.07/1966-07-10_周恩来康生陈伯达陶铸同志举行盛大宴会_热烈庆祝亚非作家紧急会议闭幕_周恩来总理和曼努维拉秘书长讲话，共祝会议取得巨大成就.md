	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, July 9 -- Comrade Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council, Comrade Kang Sheng, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Secretary of the Secretariat, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Comrade Chen Boda, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Director of the Cultural Revolution Group, and Comrade Tao Zhu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Minister of Propaganda, and Vice Premier of the State Council, held a grand banquet at the Great Hall of the People this evening to warmly celebrate the successful conclusion of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers.

	Premier Zhou spoke first at the banquet. He praised the conference, saying that it had raised the banner of struggle against imperialism led by the United States and neocolonialism, both old and new, and had strongly supported the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the Asian and African peoples and the people of the world. It had also strongly supported the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression for national liberation. The conference had fully discussed the development of new national culture and literature in Asia and Africa, demonstrating a spirit of democratic consultation and achieving great success. It was a revolutionary conference. It was a conference of unity. It was a conference of victory. Premier Zhou said, "I, together with Comrades Kang Sheng, Chen Boda, and Tao Zhu, represent the Chinese people and the Chinese government in extending warm congratulations to the Asian and African writers. At the same time, on behalf of all the workers, peasants, and soldiers of China, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals who are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the leadership of the Communist Party of China, we extend revolutionary greetings of struggle to the Asian and African writers."

	In his speech, Premier Zhou strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for escalating their aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious level. Premier Zhou reiterated: The Chinese people and the Chinese government are determined to support the Vietnamese people, our brothers, at any risk and at any cost, until final victory is achieved. Premier Zhou emphasized that the struggle against U.S. imperialism is a life-and-death struggle. Either we defeat U.S. imperialism, or we submit to it. There is no middle ground. All the revolutionary peoples of the world must abandon any illusions, believe in the power of the people, rely on the power of the people, unite as one, persist in the struggle, and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

	Premier Zhou condemned the reactionary cliques of India and the Soviet revisionist leadership for playing a shameful role in the U.S. imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam. Premier Zhou pointed out that in the international anti-imperialist united front, the Soviet revisionist leadership and the Indian reactionaries cannot be included. On the contrary, they can only be the objects of struggle in the international anti-imperialist united front.

	Premier Zhou said that smashing the decadent, reactionary old culture and old ideas of imperialism and colonialism, and establishing and developing a new culture and new ideas of anti-imperialist revolution, of the people, and of the nation, is a common task facing the peoples of Asia and Africa. In this regard, the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers has made outstanding contributions.

	Premier Zhou said that at this emergency conference, the representatives of various countries warmly congratulated the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. Many representatives highly praised our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong and the great Mao Zedong Thought, and gave high evaluations to our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a manifestation of their boundless trust and support for the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. This is an encouragement and exhortation for the Chinese people to better learn and apply Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. For this, we express our heartfelt thanks to all our friends. You can be assured that the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people will forever be loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought and will never disappoint the expectations of the peoples of the world.

	Party and state leaders Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, He Long, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, Bo Yibo, Li Xuefeng, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, Ye Jianying, Xie Fuzhi, Guo Moruo, Lin Feng, Liu Ningyi, Yang Mingxuan, Peng Dehuai, Zhang Zhizhong, as well as Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Shen Yanbing, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Fu Zuoyi and Cai Tingkai, attended the banquet and celebrated with the representatives of Asian and African writers and other friends from various countries the great achievements of the historically significant Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers.

	Secretary-General Manuvera of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers spoke at the banquet. He expressed heartfelt thanks on behalf of the writers from various Asian and African countries participating in the emergency conference to Premier Zhou Enlai, Kang Sheng, Chen Boda, and Tao Zhu. He said that the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers had achieved victory and completed its predetermined tasks. We have an even firmer resolve to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the liberation struggles of the Asian and African peoples, and to develop the new culture and literature of the Asian and African peoples.

	In his speech, Manuvera highly praised the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said that our trust in you is once again manifested in our unanimous decision at this conference that the Third Conference of Asian and African Writers will be held in your country. He concluded by raising a toast, wishing the Third Conference of Asian and African Writers, which will be held next year, a great success, wishing further unity among Asian and African writers and peoples, and wishing new victories in the struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people.

	The banquet hall was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere. During the banquet, the orchestra played Chinese revolutionary songs such as "People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Unite!" The artists of the Guinea Zoliba Dance Troupe, who were invited to the banquet, sang songs praising Chairman Mao.
