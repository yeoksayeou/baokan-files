	Just Congo (Brazzaville) representative Claude Enndala said at the emergency conference of Asian and African writers today, the victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle shows that American imperialism is a paper tiger. As long as the people of the world dare to fight, they will surely win.

	He said, American imperialism represents unprecedented barbarism, cunning, cowardice, and ferocity. The struggle of the Vietnamese people reflects the desire of all people in the world for freedom and independence.

	Enndala said, the people of Congo (Brazzaville) have united with Asian and African brothers in the common struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States. We declare that we fully support our Vietnamese brothers who are bravely fighting for the progress of humanity. We not only want the Americans to get out of Vietnam, but also out of Congo (Kinshasa), the Dominican Republic, South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, and other parts of the world.

	Enndala said, we are the true strong ones, imperialism is only strong in appearance.

    刚果（布）代表恩达拉的发言
    新华社二日讯　刚果（布）代表克洛德·恩达拉今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，越南人民斗争的胜利说明，美帝国主义是纸老虎。全世界人民只要敢于斗争，就必然会取得胜利。
    他说，美帝国主义象征着史无前例的野蛮、奸诈、卑怯和凶恶。越南人民的斗争反映了全世界人民对自由和独立的渴望。
    恩达拉说，刚果（布）人民在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中，已经和亚非兄弟结合在一起了。我们宣布，我们完全声援为了进步人类而英勇战斗的越南兄弟。我们不仅要美国佬从越南滚出去，而且要它从刚果（利）、从圣多明各、从南朝鲜、从印度尼西亚、从台湾、从世界其他各地滚出去。
    恩达拉说，我们是真正的强者，帝国主义只不过外表强大而已。
