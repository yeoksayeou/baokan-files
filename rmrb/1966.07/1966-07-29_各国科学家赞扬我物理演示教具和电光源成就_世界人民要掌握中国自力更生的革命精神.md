Today, another group of scientists attending the Beijing Physics Symposium visited the exhibition halls for physics demonstration equipment and light sources. They expressed admiration for the achievements made by Chinese scientists and the broad masses of teachers and students, who, with a spirit of hard work, self-reliance, thrift, and building the country, have created these results. They also wished that "China's great spirit of self-reliance could quickly influence the whole world and be grasped by the people of the world."

Many pieces of mechanical, electrical, and optical demonstration equipment, made with the spirit of doing more with less, left a deep impression on the foreign scientists.

Pakistani scientist Hussain repeatedly praised, "Excellent! Excellent!" Japanese scientist Minato Akio, after the visit, asked his Chinese friends to write the four Chinese characters "thrift in building the country" in his notebook.

The foreign guests showed particular interest in the modern physics section. The microwave demonstration apparatus, laser communication equipment, and other teaching aids on display are usually expensive precision instruments. However, Chinese teachers and students, with a liberated mind, dared to break through superstitions, dared to think and act, and made these designs and manufactured them themselves.

In front of the electron diffraction demonstration apparatus, which demonstrates one of the basic phenomena of atomic physics experiments, Mexican scientist Seto carefully drew its structural diagram and made detailed annotations. Today, she was visiting for the second time. She and another Mexican scientist, Pena, both said they had benefited greatly from this exhibition and expressed their intention to take back the design ideas and methods of these teaching aids to Mexico. When the guide used a cloud chamber to demonstrate the trajectories of charged particles emitted by a radioactive source, Japanese scientist Dansei immediately photographed this fleeting phenomenon and expressed heartfelt admiration for the Chinese teachers' efforts in turning difficult conditions into favorable ones.

In the light source exhibition hall, the guide was a young scientist from the light source laboratory of the physics department of Fudan University in Shanghai, led by Cai Zucuan. The foreign guests continuously raised questions and discussed with him. They expressed admiration for the self-reliant path taken by Cai Zucuan, a worker expert armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The young Chinese scientist concluded with a quote from Chairman Mao: "People's social existence determines people's thoughts. And the correct thoughts representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force to transform society and the world." At this moment, the Japanese friends immediately requested the guide to light up the photographic iodine-tungsten lamp created by Cai Zucuan and eagerly stood in front of the large red-and-gold plaque with Chairman Mao's words, taking memorable photos of each other.

At the end of the visit, Afghan scientist Wulam Sidiq Muhibi wished the Chinese scientific workers greater achievements in the future. Japanese scientist Minato Akio, with a moved heart, wrote in the guestbook: "I hope that China's spirit of self-reliance can quickly influence the whole world and be grasped by the people of the world."

### 各国科学家赞扬我物理演示教具和电光源成就  世界人民要掌握中国自力更生的革命精神

    各国科学家赞扬我物理演示教具和电光源成就
    世界人民要掌握中国自力更生的革命精神
    新华社二十八日讯  今天，又有一部分出席北京物理讨论会的科学家参观了物理演示教具陈列室和电光源陈列室。他们对中国科学家和广大师生本着艰苦奋斗，奋发图强，自力更生，勤俭建国的革命精神所创造出来的成绩表示钦佩，并且祝愿“中国伟大的自力更生精神能够很快影响全世界，为全世界人民所掌握。”
    许多本着少花钱，多办事的精神而制成的力学、电学和光学演示教具给各国科学家留下深刻的印象。
    巴基斯坦科学家侯赛因连声赞扬说：“很好！很好！”日本科学家岬晓夫在参观以后，请中国朋友在他的笔记本上写下“勤俭建国”四个中国字。
    外宾们对近代物理部分特别感兴趣。这里陈列的微波示教仪、激光通讯装置等教具，本来都是要花较多的钱才能买到的精密仪器。但是，中国师生们解放思想，破除迷信，敢想敢干，自己动手把它们设计和制造了出来。
    在演示原子物理的基本实验现象之一的电子衍射演示仪前面，墨西哥科学家塞托认真地画下了它的结构图，并且作了详细的注解。今天，她已经是第二次来参观了。她和另一位墨西哥科学家佩纳都说看了这个展览受了很大教益，并且表示要把这些教具的设计思想和方法带回墨西哥去。当讲解员用云室来演示放射源放射出来的带电粒子的径迹时，日本科学家丹生洁马上用照相机拍下这个瞬息即逝的现象，并且对善于把困难条件转变为有利条件的中国教师们所作的努力，表示由衷的敬佩。
    在电光源陈列室，担任讲解的是蔡祖泉所领导的上海复旦大学物理系电光源实验室的一个青年科学工作者。外宾们不断提出问题同他进行探讨。他们对于蔡祖泉这样一个以毛泽东思想武装了头脑的工人专家所走的自力更生的道路表示钦佩。这位中国青年科学工作者最后以毛主席的这段语录来说明蔡祖泉和他的战友取得成就的力量所在：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”这时，日本朋友们立即要求讲解员点亮蔡祖泉所创制的摄影用碘钨灯，并且纷纷站到书写着毛主席这段话的红底金字的巨幅语录牌前，互相拍摄下这个值得留念的镜头。
    在结束参观时，阿富汗科学家吴拉姆·西迪克·穆希比祝愿中国科学工作者今后取得更巨大的成绩。日本科学家岬晓夫怀着激动的心情在留言簿上写道：希望中国的自力更生精神能够很快影响全世界，为全世界人民所掌握。
