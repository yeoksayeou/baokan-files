	Born for the Revolution, Great in Life;
	Died for the Revolution, Glorious in Death

	People's Liberation Army Unit, Wang Zheng

	"How should one spend one's life?" This is the question that the communist warrior Liu Yingjun, in the style of Ouyang Hai, posed in a diary entry for his own life, and it is also a question that Liu Yingjun posed to every proletarian revolutionary, a question worth deep thought.

	Liu Yingjun answered this fundamental question with his revolutionary practice. He lived for the people's interests, living greatly, living heavier than Mount Tai; he died for the people's interests, dying gloriously, dying heavier than Mount Tai.

	Different classes have diametrically opposed attitudes towards life and death.

	"Man does not live for himself, but for the sake of others." This is the attitude of all exploiting classes towards life and death. This view of life and death revolves around the "self," with life and death revolving around the "self." Modern revisionists believe in the "philosophy of survival," as long as they can eat "beef and potatoes," they don't care if they kneel down, betray, and surrender. They place their lives in the "wisdom" of imperialism, in the "goodwill" of imperialism. "A good death is better than a miserable life" is their philosophy of life.

	The attitude of proletarian revolutionaries towards life and death is completely different from that of all exploiting classes. Life and death are both opposed and united. Without life, there is no death. Without death, there is no life. Without a few people sacrificing for the revolution, there would be no survival for the majority. The sacrifice of a few for the revolution is precisely for the survival of the majority. Therefore, the proletariat's attitude towards life and death is to live for the people and die for the people; to live for the revolution and die for the revolution. Life and death revolve around the people and the revolution. Liu Hulan bravely sacrificed herself to preserve the party organization. Huang Jiguang sacrificed himself to block the gun port, avoiding heavy casualties for the following troops. Wang Jie threw himself at the explosion point, protecting the lives of twelve class brothers. Though they died, they live on, dying to live forever.

	Life and death, ultimately, are a matter of worldview. Liu Yingjun's worldview is to dedicate himself to the people—Chinese people and people of the world; to dedicate himself to the revolution—Chinese revolution and world revolution. As long as it is for the people, as long as it is for the revolution, personal life and death are all disregarded. Facing life, he vowed to the people of his country: "I am willing to dedicate my youth and life to you, to the most magnificent cause in the world"; facing death, he said: "As long as I dedicate myself to the country, to the people, to the truth, even if I sacrifice my life and lose my youth, I will still feel proud and honored...." From life to death, he made the earth brighter and the sun and moon more radiant.

	How did Liu Yingjun establish his communist worldview of dedicating himself to the people and the revolution? The key is that he truly regarded Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide his practical activities.

	The process of establishing a communist worldview is the process of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Every time Liu Yingjun studied a work by Chairman Mao, he would ask himself four questions: ① How did Chairman Mao say it? ② How do I think about it? ③ How do I do it? ④ How should I do it in the future? He would handle every problem by "connecting it with Chairman Mao's works, finding the answers in Chairman Mao's works." In short, he actively learned and applied, focusing on the "application" and truly achieving unity of learning and practice, putting it into action. Using Mao Zedong Thought to transform his own thoughts and guide his actions, this is the secret of Liu Yingjun truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought and establishing a communist worldview. We should learn from Liu Yingjun, learning to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, establishing a communist worldview.

	In the current Cultural Revolution, a handful of anti-party and anti-socialist elements are frantically attacking Mao Zedong Thought, maliciously slandering the workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Mao Zedong Thought as "simplification" and "vulgarization." Liu Yingjun actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm his mind and guide his actions. His heroic deed of sacrificing himself to protect the lives of the people is a resounding slap in the face of these black elements.

### 为革命而生，生的伟大  为革命而死，死的光荣

    为革命而生，生的伟大
    为革命而死，死的光荣

    “一个人的一生应怎样的度过？”这是欧阳海式的共产主义战士刘英俊同志在一篇日记里为自己的一生提出的问题，也是刘英俊同志向每一个无产阶级革命者提出的一个值得深思的问题。
    刘英俊同志用自己的革命实践回答了这个根本问题。他为人民的利益而生，生的伟大，生的重于泰山；他为人民的利益而死，死的光荣，死的也比那泰山还重。
    对待生和死，不同的阶级有着截然不同的态度。
    “人不为己，天诛地灭”。这是一切剥削阶级对待生死的态度。这种生死观，以“我”为核心，生和死，唯“我”是从。现代修正主义信奉的是“活命哲学”，只要能吃上“牛肉烧土豆”，哪管它屈膝下跪、叛变投降。他们把生寄托在帝国主义的“明智”上，寄托在帝国主义的“善心”上，“好死不如赖活”，就是他们的人生哲学。
    无产阶级革命者对待生和死的态度，和一切剥削阶级迥然不同。生和死，既是对立的，又是统一的。没有生，就没有死。没有死，就没有生。没有少数人为革命牺牲，就没有多数人的生存。少数人的为革命牺牲，正是为了多数人的生存。因此，无产阶级对待生死，是为人民而生，为人民而死；为革命而生，为革命而死。生和死，唯人民是从，唯革命是从。刘胡兰慷慨就义，保全了党的组织。黄继光舍身堵枪眼，避免了后续部队大量伤亡。王杰扑向炸点，保卫了十二个阶级兄弟的生命。他们虽死犹生，死而永生。
    生和死，归根结底是个世界观问题。刘英俊同志的世界观，就是一心为人民——中国人民和世界人民；就是一心为革命——中国革命和世界革命。只要为了人民，只要为了革命，个人的生死安危，一概置之度外。面对着生，他向祖国人民宣誓：“愿把我的青春和生命献给你，献给世界上最壮丽的事业”；面对着死，他说：“只要我一心一意为了祖国，为了人民，为了真理，哪怕牺牲了自己的生命，失去了自己的青春，我也感到骄傲和自豪……。”他从生到死，足使大地增光，日月增辉。
    刘英俊同志一心为人民，一心为革命的共产主义世界观是怎样树立起来的？关键在于他真正把毛主席的书当作最高指示，用毛泽东思想指导自己的实践活动。
    树立共产主义世界观的过程，就是活学活用毛泽东思想的过程。刘英俊同志每学一篇毛主席著作，都要向自己提出四个问题：①毛主席是怎样讲的？②我是怎样想的？③我是怎样做的？④今后应当怎样去做？他每处理一个问题，都“要联系毛主席著作，要从毛主席著作上找答案”。一句话，他活学活用，在“用”字上狠下功夫，真正做到了学用一致，身体力行。用毛泽东思想改造自己的思想，指导自己的行动，这就是刘英俊同志真正把毛泽东思想学到手，树立起共产主义世界观的秘密所在。我们学习刘英俊同志，就是要学习他活学活用毛泽东思想，树立起共产主义的世界观。
    在当前的文化大革命中，一小撮反党反社会主义分子拚命攻击毛泽东思想，大肆诬蔑工农兵群众学习毛泽东思想是“简单化”“庸俗化”。刘英俊同志活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，指导自己的行动。他为了保卫人民群众生命安全而英勇献身的英雄行为，正好给了这伙黑帮分子一记响亮的耳光。
