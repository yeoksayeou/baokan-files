The great call by Chairman Mao to "definitely cure the Hai River" has inspired the people of Hebei Province. The large-scale water control project in the Heilonggang River basin, which began last autumn, has been basically completed in just four months by more than 400,000 workers. This is a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a new victory for the people of Hebei in implementing the Party's policy of self-reliance and frugal water control.

The completion of this large-scale water control project has ensured that more than 20 million mu of farmland is basically free from waterlogging, creating conditions for a significant increase in production and changing the face of agricultural production in Hebei Province. It has also provided valuable experience for future large-scale water control projects.

The Heilonggang River water control project is a major undertaking in the effort to control the Hai River. It involves the simultaneous expansion and dredging of nine main rivers and 35 smaller rivers, the construction of 840 bridges and 60 culverts. The total volume of earthwork is 180 million cubic meters. The scale and difficulty of this project are unprecedented in the history of water control in Hebei Province. Under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of Hebei Province have completed all the main projects and corresponding bridges and culverts ahead of schedule by more than 30 days. Currently, the excavation of tributary rivers is being accelerated. The total investment for the main and tributary river projects is about 20% less than the planned investment. The quality of all completed projects meets national standards and achieves the goals of being fast, good, and economical.

Currently, the nine main rivers in the Heilonggang River area, totaling 900 kilometers in length, have been universally deepened and widened, and some new drainage rivers have been opened. The drainage capacity of the rivers has increased several times to more than ten times. Even if a large-scale waterlogging event like the one in 1964 were to occur again, more than 20 million mu of farmland would be basically free from waterlogging.

Several million young trees planted on both sides of the dikes along the various rivers have taken root. The new bridges spanning the main rivers are now open to traffic. The 700,000 mu of terraces built by the construction units using the excavated soil have already been planted with crops. The wheat in the areas along the rivers has had a good harvest this year. A new and beautiful picture of the Heilonggang River area is beginning to emerge. The people of the Heilonggang River area, who have long dreamed of this, have seen their wishes come true in the great era of Mao Zedong. The broad masses of the people are overjoyed and praise the newly dredged and excavated rivers as "rivers of happiness" and the newly built dikes as "socialist dikes." Everyone sings the praises of the beloved leader Chairman Mao and the great Communist Party.

The Heilonggang River basin is located in the southeastern part of Hebei Province, bordered by the Zhang River to the south, the South Canal to the east, and the Hongyang River and Ziya River to the west. It includes more than 40 counties (cities) east of the line from Handan to Xingtai and west of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, covering an area of 19,700 square kilometers. This area was previously surrounded by floodwaters and had no outlet for drainage. Waterlogging often occurred, submerging vast tracts of farmland and causing severe salinization of the soil.

After liberation, the Communist Party and the people's government led the masses in large-scale water control projects. In late 1959, a large-scale drainage project, the South Drainage River, was started. However, due to the low standards of this project, it failed to eliminate the waterlogging in this area.

Inspired by Chairman Mao's great call to "definitely cure the Hai River," the Hebei Provincial leadership, in accordance with the unified plan for controlling the Hai River, began the Heilonggang River drainage project on October 15, 1965. More than 400,000 workers were mobilized to launch a "decisive battle" in this area.

To win this decisive battle, before the start of construction, the people in various places studied Chairman Mao's instruction to "definitely cure the Hai River." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call. The number of people signing up for work quickly exceeded the number of workers needed by several times to more than ten times. The enthusiasm of the people in the construction areas for water control was even higher. In addition to actively participating in the work, they also voluntarily vacated rooms and provided their own tools and furniture for the workers to use.

More than 70% of the workers participating in this construction were poor and lower-middle peasants. During the construction process, they regarded Mao Zedong's works as the highest directives and insisted on studying and applying them. Many study groups of Mao Zedong's works were established on the construction sites, and more than 27,000 activists who studied Mao Zedong's works were selected from among the workers to serve as study guides. Through their studies, the workers' revolutionary spirit was greatly inspired. Many people said, "Mao Zedong's works are omnipotent. Wherever you study, you will be enlightened. No matter how difficult it is, it will not be difficult after reading Chairman Mao's books." The excavation of the Hongle Drainage River was particularly arduous. The cadres organized the workers to bring their problems and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Everyone used their brains to find solutions, creating the "rolling trench excavation method" to solve the problem of uneven soil moisture in the upper and lower layers, greatly improving work efficiency. The construction tasks for a winter and a spring were completed in just over 60 days.

During the construction process, the broad masses of cadres and workers also followed the Party and Chairman Mao's teachings, seriously implementing the policy of self-reliance and frugal water control, and sparing no effort to save national expenses. After the workers studied and applied Mao Zedong's works, their class consciousness was greatly enhanced. According to incomplete statistics, more than 700 worker units have been rated as advanced collectives, and more than 150,000 people have been rated as "five-good" workers.

The successful completion of the Heilonggang River water control project is also the result of the planning and design personnel's high举毛泽东思想伟大红旗, breaking the authority of the bourgeoisie, and carrying out a revolution in design. For the excavation of the South Drainage River alone, the amount of earthwork was reduced by 52 million cubic meters compared to the original design, saving 3 million man-days and 29 million yuan in investment. Moreover, this project can simultaneously achieve the benefits of flood control, drainage, salinization control, and irrigation.

    毛主席“一定要根治海河”的伟大号召鼓舞河北全省人民
    黑龙港流域排水工程四个月基本完成
    二千多万亩耕地基本上免除涝灾，为大面积增产创造了条件
    据新华社保定六日电  河北人民响应毛主席“一定要根治海河”的伟大号召，在去年秋后动工兴修的一项大规模根治海河的工程——黑龙港流域排水工程，经过四十多万民工，一百二十天的艰苦奋斗，已经在最近基本完成。这是毛泽东思想的一次新胜利，也是河北人民执行党的自力更生、勤俭治水方针的一次新胜利。
    这项大规模治水工程的完成，使二千多万亩耕地基本上免除涝灾，为大面积增产、改变河北省农业生产面貌创造了条件。同时，还为今后更大规模的根治海河创造了丰富经验。
    黑龙港排水工程是根治海河的一项大工程。它包括同时扩大疏浚九条骨干河道，三十五条小河，建造八百四十多座桥梁和六十座涵闸。全部工程的土方有一亿八千多万立米，工程之艰巨，规模之大，是河北省水利建设史上少有的。敢于革命的河北省人民，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，提前三十多天超额完成了全部骨干工程和相应桥梁涵闸建筑物。目前，开挖支流河道的工程正在加紧施工。全部干支流工程的投资，比计划投资节约了百分之二十左右。已经完成的各项工程质量，全部符合国家标准，达到多快好省的要求。
    目前，黑龙港地区总长九百公里的九条骨干河道的河身已经普遍加深加宽，并且新开辟了一些排水河道。河道的排水能力提高了几倍到十几倍。即使再发生象一九六四年那样大的沥水，也可以使二千多万亩耕地基本免除沥涝灾害。
    在各条河道大堤两旁新栽的几百万棵幼树已经成活。横跨在各条干流上的新落成的桥梁全部通行车辆。各施工单位利用挖河弃土修起的七万多亩台田，有一部分已经种上了庄稼。河道两岸地区小麦今年获得了较好的收成。一幅黑龙港地区最新最美的图画，开始展现在人们的面前。黑龙港地区的人民群众千百年来梦寐以求的事情，在伟大的毛泽东时代实现了。广大人民群众欢欣鼓舞，称赞新疏浚新开挖的河道是“幸福河”，新筑起的大堤是“社会主义大堤”。人人歌颂敬爱的领袖毛主席，歌颂伟大的共产党。
    黑龙港流域在河北省的东南部，南至漳河，东至南运河，西至滏阳河，子牙河，包括邯郸、邢台一线以东、津浦铁路以西的四十多个县（市），是一片大平原，面积达一万九千七百平方公里。这里四周过去一直为洪水河道所围绕，排水无出路。常常发生涝灾，淹没大片农田，并使土地严重盐碱化。
    解放后，共产党和人民政府领导人民群众进行了大规模的水利建设。一九五九年年底，曾经动工兴建一项大型的排水工程——南大排水河工程。但是，由于这项工程标准偏低，仍然未能根除这个地区的涝灾。
    为了彻底改变这个地区沥涝多灾的面貌，在毛主席“一定要根治海河”的伟大号召鼓舞下，河北省领导机关按照根治海河的统一规划，于一九六五年十月十五日开始，集中了四十多万民工，在这个地区打了一个“歼灭战”：兴修黑龙港地区排水工程。
    为了打好这场歼灭战，开工前，各地人民学习了毛主席“一定要根治海河”的指示。各地广大贫农下中农社员带头响应毛主席的号召。报名出工的人数，很快超过了出工人数几倍到十几倍。施工地区的社员们，治河的革命热情更高。他们除了积极出工以外，还主动腾房子，拿出自己的工具和家具，给民工使用。
    这次参加施工的民工中，贫农下中农占百分之七十以上。他们在施工过程中，把毛主席的书当作最高指示，坚持活学活用毛主席著作。工地建立了很多学习毛主席著作的组织，从民工中选拔了二万七千多名学习毛主席著作积极分子，担任学习辅导员。广大民工通过学习，革命精神大振。许多人说：“毛主席著作是万能，那里学了那里灵。千难万难，读了毛主席的书就不难。”开挖滏乐排河的工程十分艰巨。干部组织民工们带着问题，反复学习了毛主席的《矛盾论》、《愚公移山》等著作，大家动脑筋想办法，创造出“滚沟开挖法”，解决了上下层土干湿不均的大难题，大大提高了工效。一冬一春的施工任务，只用了六十多天就全部完工了。
    在施工过程中，广大干部和民工还按照党和毛主席的教导，认真执行自力更生、勤俭治河方针，千方百计为国家节省开支。民工活学活用毛主席著作后，阶级觉悟有了很大提高。据不完全统计，已有七百多个民工单位被评为先进集体，有十五万多人被评为“五好”民工。
    黑龙港流域治水工程的胜利完成，也是规划设计人员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，破资产阶级“权威”，大搞设计革命化的结果。只开挖南大排水河一项工程，就比原来设计减少土方量五百二十万立米，少用三百万个工，节省投资二百九十多万元，而且这项工程可以同时收到防洪、除涝、治碱、灌溉等效益。
