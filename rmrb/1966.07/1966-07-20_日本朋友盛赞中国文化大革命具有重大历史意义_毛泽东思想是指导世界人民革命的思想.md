Japanese friends from the second batch of the Yamagata Prefecture delegation of the Japanese Socialist Party and the Hokkaido delegation to China praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the Chinese people under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought as a movement of great historical significance on the eve of their return home. They said that Mao Zedong Thought is not only the guiding ideology for the Chinese people's revolution but also for the revolution of the people of the world.

Watanabe Saburo, leader of the Yamagata Prefecture delegation, said that the past month in China has been a month of wholeheartedly studying the works of Chairman Mao. We have learned how the Chinese people, especially the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice. We believe that after returning home, we must further strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to solve the various major problems facing Japan.

Many Japanese friends enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Saito Naomi, leader of the Hokkaido delegation, said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution carried out by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and students in China is a brilliant product of great Mao Zedong Thought.

The Japanese friends spoke passionately about their deep impressions of visiting the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an and Mao Zedong's hometown of Shaoshan, praising the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Takuchi Tatsuo, a member of the Yamagata Prefecture delegation, said, "In Yan'an, we saw the brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought. I am deeply impressed by Mao Zedong Thought."

Maeno Goro, deputy leader of the Yamagata Prefecture delegation, said, "Chairman Mao wrote many books in the simple rooms of Yan'an, among which the two articles 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' and 'Serve the People' left a deep impression on me."

He said, "Chairman Mao, who praised the selfless spirit of Norman Bethune, himself possesses noble virtues."

　　日本朋友盛赞中国文化大革命具有重大历史意义
　　毛泽东思想是指导世界人民革命的思想
    据新华社广州十八日电　第二批日本社会党活动家山形县访华代表团和北海道访华代表团的日本朋友们，回国前夕在这里盛赞中国人民在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下进行的无产阶级文化大革命运动，是具有历史意义的运动。他们说，毛泽东思想不单是指导中国人民革命的思想，而且是指导世界人民革命的思想。
    山形县代表团团长渡边三郎说，在中国的一个月里，是我们全心全意学习毛主席著作的一个月。
    我们学习了中国人民特别是广大工农兵群众怎样把毛泽东思想运用到实际中去的经验。我们认为，回国后要进一步加强毛主席著作的学习，并且要很好地用毛泽东思想，去解决日本面临的各项重大问题。
    许多日本朋友热情赞扬中国文化大革命运动。北海道代表团团长斋藤直巳说，中国广大工农兵、学生广泛开展的文化大革命运动，是伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉产物。
    日本朋友满怀激情地谈到了访问革命圣地延安和毛主席故乡韶山冲的深刻印象，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想。山形县代表团团员高内达雄说，在延安我们看到了伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。我对毛泽东思想感到非常钦佩。
    山形县代表团副团长前野五郎说，毛主席在延安简陋的房子里，写了许多书，其中《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》两篇文章给我很深刻的印象。
    他说，赞扬白求恩毫不利己精神的毛主席，本身就具有高贵的品德。
