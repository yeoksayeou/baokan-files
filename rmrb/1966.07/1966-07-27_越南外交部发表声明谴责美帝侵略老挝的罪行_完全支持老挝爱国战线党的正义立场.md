The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on July 25 condemning the U.S. government's blatant violation of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos. The statement demands that the U.S. government must cease all acts of interference and aggression against Laos, halt all U.S. air activities in Laos, withdraw all U.S. and allied military personnel from Laos, and genuinely respect Laos' peace, neutrality, sovereignty, and independence.

The statement points out that over the past four years, U.S. imperialism, the pro-U.S. faction in Laos, and some countries following the U.S. have systematically violated the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos. The U.S. directed its puppets to stage a coup on April 19, 1964, attempting to dissolve the tripartite coalition government of Laos. The U.S. installed a pro-U.S. regime as a tool to intensify its interference and aggression in Laos. The U.S. illegally sent thousands of military advisors and some Thai army units to Laos; using the pro-U.S. military in Laos, as well as bandits and paramilitary forces, to launch continuous incursions against areas controlled by Lao patriotic forces. For over two years, U.S. planes flying from bases in Thailand, South Vietnam, and the U.S. Seventh Fleet, as well as B-52 bombers from U.S. bases in the Pacific, have been continuously bombing and strafing Lao territory in a barbaric manner. At the same time, the U.S. frequently sends its planes from Thailand to cross into Lao airspace and bomb the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Most seriously, while intensifying the war in Vietnam and continuously provoking Cambodia with armed forces, the U.S. is now planning to send tens of thousands of U.S. troops to Laos, preparing to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina Peninsula. The U.S.'s blatant acts of sabotage and conspiracies against Laos pose a grave threat to the peace and security of the entire Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The statement says that the U.S. imperialist's criminal actions have been met with appropriate punishment from the Lao people and patriotic armed forces. Tens of thousands of U.S. puppet soldiers have been annihilated; hundreds of U.S. aggressor planes have been shot down; and all U.S. and puppet incursions have been thwarted. The liberated areas of Laos have been consolidated. Under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao people's just struggle to defend their revolutionary achievements has increasingly gained the strong sympathy and support of the world's progressive public opinion.

The statement says that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully agrees with the views expressed in the statement issued by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front on July 23, 1966, and thoroughly supports the correct stance of this statement.

The statement concludes by saying that the Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are immensely pleased with the victories achieved by the fraternal Lao people over the past four years, and firmly believe that the Lao people and patriotic armed forces will certainly smash all U.S. imperialist plots of aggression and lead Laos to a path of peace, neutrality, independence, unity, democracy, and prosperity.

    越南外交部发表声明谴责美帝侵略老挝的罪行
    完全支持老挝爱国战线党的正义立场
    新华社河内二十六日电　越南民主共和国外交部二十五日就一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议签订四周年发表声明，严厉谴责美国政府明目张胆地破坏这个协议；坚决要求美国政府必须停止干涉和侵略老挝的一切行动和阴谋，必须停止美国空军在老挝的一切活动，把美国及其仆从的军事人员全部撤出老挝，必须真正地尊重老挝的和平、中立、主权和独立。
    声明指出，四年来，美帝国主义、老挝亲美派以及追随美国的一些国家，一直有系统地破坏了一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。
    美国指使它的走狗，于一九六四年四月十九日发动了政变，企图取消老挝三方民族团结政府。美国扶植了一个亲美政权作为它加紧对老挝的干涉和侵略的工具。美国非法向老挝派遣了数以千计的美国军事顾问和一些泰国陆军部队；利用老挝亲美派的军队以及土匪和别动队，连续向老挝爱国力量所控制的地区发动蚕食进攻。两年多来，从泰国、越南南方各基地和第七舰队起飞的美国飞机、以及从太平洋地区美国基地起飞的B—52型飞机，每天连续不断地对老挝领土进行极其野蛮的轰炸和扫射。同时，美国还经常出动它在泰国的飞机越过老挝领空侵入越南民主共和国进行轰炸。特别严重的是，美国在加强侵越战争和接连不断地对柬埔寨进行武装挑衅的同时，目前正打算派遣成万名美军进驻老挝，准备把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那。美国对老挝的明目张胆的破坏行动和阴谋，极其严重地威胁着整个印度支那和东南亚的和平与安全。
    声明说，美帝国主义的这一罪恶行动，遭到了老挝人民和爱国武装力量的应有惩罚。数以万计的美国走狗军队被歼灭；数以百计的美国强盗飞机被击落；美国及其走狗的各次蚕食进攻被粉碎。老挝的解放区获得了巩固。在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，老挝人民为保卫革命成果所进行的正义斗争，日益赢得了世界进步舆论的强有力的同情和支持。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府完全赞同老挝爱国战线党中央委员会一九六六年七月二十三日声明中所阐明的观点，并彻底支持这一声明的正确立场。
    声明最后说，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府对兄弟的老挝人民四年来所取得的胜利感到无限高兴，并且深信，老挝人民和老挝爱国武装力量必将粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋，并使老挝走上和平、中立、独立、统一、民主和繁荣的道路。（附图片）
