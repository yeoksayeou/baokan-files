The Canadian "Progressive Workers' Movement" published a statement in its August issue of the magazine *Progressive Worker* to commemorate the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. The statement said that the outstanding contributions made by the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong to Marxism-Leninism have universal significance and applicability. "The Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong have set a great revolutionary example for us."

The statement said: "After the CPSU leadership betrayed Marxism-Leninism and became the center of revisionist thought serving the reactionary and aggressive policies of imperialism, the victory of the Communist Party of China and the tremendous experience gained in the struggle under the leadership of Mao Zedong have shown their extraordinary importance. Because of the firm stand taken by the Communist Party of China, Marxist-Leninists around the world have been able to quickly rally their forces to effectively resist the revisionists and their imperialist masters."

The statement said, "The peoples of the world are infinitely grateful to the Communist Party of China and the Chinese revolutionary people who remain steadfast in the face of all threats and attacks by the combined forces of revisionism and imperialism, and to their great leader and outstanding thinker, Mao Zedong."

The statement reviewed the history of the Communist Party of China. It said that the process of the Communist Party of China growing stronger and advancing from victory to victory "irrefutably proves the invincible power of Marxism-Leninism, and proves that the great Communist Party of China, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, correctly interprets Marxism-Leninism and applies it to the conditions of China. Mao Zedong is the helmsman who ensures the great victories of the Chinese people."

In praising the current Cultural Revolution in China, the statement said: "In defending the victories of the revolution, revolutionary cadres have never relaxed their vigilance for a moment. Even today, long after seizing power, the Chinese people, under the leadership of their great and tested Communist Party, are striving to carry out the socialist cultural revolution, to eradicate the remnants of the bourgeoisie, and to purge the revisionist elements that have infiltrated the Party."

    据新华社渥太华二十三日电　加拿大“进步工人运动”在它的机关刊物《进步工人》八月号上发表一篇声明说，中国共产党和毛泽东主席对“马克思列宁主义理论作出的杰出贡献”对世界“有着普遍的意义和适用性”，“中国共产党和毛泽东主席为我们树立了伟大的革命榜样”。
    这篇纪念中国共产党成立四十五周年的声明说：“在苏共领导背叛马克思列宁主义，成为替帝国主义的反动和侵略政策效劳的修正主义思想的世界中心以后，中国共产党的胜利和它在毛泽东指引下进行斗争所取得的巨大经验的非凡重要性已经清楚地表现出来了。由于中国共产党的坚定立场，世界各地的马克思列宁主义者才能够迅速地重新集结他们的力量，对修正主义者及其帝国主义主子进行有效的抵抗。”
    声明说，“世界各国人民无限地感谢在修正主义和帝国主义联合力量的一切威胁和攻击面前坚定不移的中国共产党和中国革命人民，无限地感谢他们的伟大领袖和最杰出的思想家毛泽东。”
    声明追述了中国共产党党史。声明说，中国共产党成长壮大、从胜利走向胜利的过程“无可辩驳地证明了马克思列宁主义无坚不摧的力量，证明了伟大的中国共产党在毛泽东领导下正确解释马克思列宁主义并且用于中国的条件。毛泽东是舵手，他保证了中国人民的巨大胜利。”
    声明在赞扬目前在中国进行的社会主义文化大革命时说：在保卫革命胜利方面，革命干部一时一刻没有放松过警惕。甚至在今天，在取得政权很久以后，中国人民在他们的伟大和久经考验的共产党的领导下，正在努力致力于进行社会主义文化大革命，根除资产阶级的残余影响，清除混入党内的修正主义分子。
