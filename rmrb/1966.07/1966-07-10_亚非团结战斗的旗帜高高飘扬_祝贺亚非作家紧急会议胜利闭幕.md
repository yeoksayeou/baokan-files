The highly anticipated Emergency Conference of Asian-African Writers has successfully concluded. Over the past ten days, more than 160 representatives from 53 countries and regions in Asia and Africa have engaged in thorough, passionate, extensive, and democratic discussions on the most urgent common tasks of the Asian-African peoples. They have adopted the conference communiqué and 37 resolutions, making significant contributions to the cause of Asian-African unity and anti-imperialism. This conference marks a historic milestone in the history of the Asian-African writers' movement, a revolutionary gathering, a gathering of unity, and a gathering of victory.

This Emergency Conference of Asian-African Writers is a grand demonstration by the 2 billion people of Asia and Africa against imperialism led by the United States. Recently, imperialism and its lackeys have been shouting loudly, claiming that Asian-African unity is in crisis and that the Asian-African spirit no longer exists. However, imperialism and its lackeys are rejoicing too soon. The brilliant achievements of this Beijing conference vividly prove that the spirit of Asian-African anti-imperialist unity is invincible and full of vitality. The Asian-African peoples have achieved another great victory, while imperialism and its lackeys have suffered another shameful defeat.

Under the golden sunlight, the banner of Asian-African anti-imperialist unity proudly waves in the wind! The Beijing conference has brought the Asian-African writers' movement to a new stage. The revolutionary spirit of anti-imperialism pervades this Beijing conference. The communiqué and resolutions adopted by the conference firmly oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism, especially the aggressive and war policies of the United States, the number one enemy of the Asian-African peoples. The conference resolutely supports the liberation struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations in Asia, Africa, and the world. The communiqué sternly condemns all vile plots to sabotage Asian-African writers' unity. The conference also adopted resolutions to firmly oppose Western imperialist cultural aggression against Asian-African countries and to promote the development of anti-imperialist, revolutionary, and national new cultures of the Asian-African peoples. All of this reflects the shared will of the Asian-African peoples to unite, to be independent, to be free, and to carry the anti-imperialist revolution through to the end.

Vietnam is currently the most intense battlefield in international struggles and the frontline of the Asian-African peoples' anti-imperialist struggle. The central theme of this conference is to oppose the U.S. imperialist armed aggression against Vietnam and to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The 2 billion people of Asia and Africa stand with the heroic Vietnamese people. With the support of the Asian-African peoples and the people of the world, the Vietnamese people, by persevering in their anti-U.S. war, will certainly drive the U.S. aggressors out of their country entirely and achieve the final victory in their struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. Those who run errands for U.S. imperialism, openly and secretly peddling the "peace talks" fraud of the Johnson administration, are not only betraying the Vietnamese people's revolutionary cause but also betraying the Asian-African peoples' revolutionary cause. Their dirty dealings will be exposed and smashed in the anti-U.S. torrent of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world.

At present, the revolutionary peoples of the world, especially the Asian-African peoples, are engaged in an unprecedentedly fierce struggle against the counter-revolutionary forces led by U.S. imperialism. Tens of millions of people are continuously surging into the revolutionary torrent, while a small number of pseudo-revolutionaries and counter-revolutionary scum and dregs will inevitably be washed away and swept out. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is striving to sabotage Asian-African unity and the revolutionary cause of the Asian-African peoples, and has degenerated into a lackey of U.S. imperialism, placing themselves in a position opposed to the Asian-African peoples and the peoples of the world. The Asian-African peoples and the peoples of the world are further expanding and strengthening the international united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. This is a genuine, not a hypocritical, broad, not narrow, international united front. It should include all countries and peoples who are subjected to U.S. imperialist aggression, interference, control, and bullying, but it must not include the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, because they are lackeys and accomplices of U.S. imperialism. It is not accidental that the representatives at the conference pointed out in their speeches that opposing imperialism must mean opposing revisionism.

At this Beijing conference, many representatives from various countries, with the most sincere feelings and the most beautiful language, praised Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They said: Chairman Mao is the "great teacher and leader of the peoples of the world," the "great helmsman of China and the world," and the "greatest hope of the oppressed peoples." They said that the great Mao Zedong Thought is the "peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism," the "unquenchable torch and red sun of all revolutionaries in the world," and a "weapon more powerful than the atomic bomb."

The Chinese people sincerely thank the Emergency Conference of Asian-African Writers for its correct international evaluation of the great Mao Zedong Thought and for their praise of the Chinese revolution and construction experience. The Chinese people attach great importance to the anti-imperialist struggle experience of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and to the revolutionary experience of the peoples of Europe and America, believing that these experiences are worth learning from.

This conference is being held at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is flourishing in our country. The conference shows that the revolutionary peoples and progressive writers of various Asian-African countries, from their own personal experiences, deeply feel that oppressed nations and oppressed peoples must thoroughly liberate themselves. They must not only strive for complete political independence and economic self-reliance but must also resolutely overthrow the reactionary and decadent old culture and old ideas of imperialist colonialism and establish and develop their own anti-imperialist, revolutionary, national new culture and new ideas. The contributions made by this conference in this regard will greatly aid the development of the Asian-African peoples' anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle and will greatly inspire the Chinese people.

The broad masses of the Chinese people have expressed their heartfelt welcome to the Asian-African writers and their enthusiastic support for this conference. This vividly embodies the great unity and fighting friendship between the Chinese people and the Asian-African peoples. We are particularly pleased that the Third Conference of Asian-African Writers will be held in Beijing. We eagerly look forward to meeting again with the representatives of the writers of various Asian-African countries next year to exchange experiences in the struggle.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Imperialism fears most the awakening of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the awakening of the peoples of the world. We must unite and drive U.S. imperialism out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America back to its old home." Asian-African writers, Asian-African peoples, unite! Let us raise higher the banner of struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, and march forward bravely towards a bright future!

### 亚非团结战斗的旗帜高高飘扬——祝贺亚非作家紧急会议胜利闭幕

    亚非团结战斗的旗帜高高飘扬
    ——祝贺亚非作家紧急会议胜利闭幕
    举世瞩目的亚非作家紧急会议，已于昨天胜利闭幕了。在过去十多天里，亚非五十三个国家和地区的一百六十多名作家代表，就亚非人民当前最迫切的共同斗争任务，进行了充分的、热烈的、广泛的、民主的讨论，通过了会议公报和三十七项决议，对亚非人民团结反帝事业作出了重大贡献。这是亚非作家运动史上的划时代的里程碑，是亚非人民的一次革命的大会，团结的大会，胜利的大会。
    这次亚非作家紧急会议，是亚非二十亿人民向以美国为首的帝国主义的一次大示威。最近以来，帝国主义及其帮凶，大叫大嚷，胡说什么亚非团结“发生危机”，亚非精神“不再存在”了。但是帝国主义及其帮凶高兴得太早了。这次北京会议的具有历史意义的光辉成就生动地证明，亚非反帝团结的精神，具有无比旺盛和不可战胜的生命力。亚非人民取得了又一次伟大的胜利，帝国主义及其帮凶遭到了又一次可耻的破产。
    亚非反帝团结的旗帜，在金色阳光的照耀下，多么骄傲地迎风飘扬！北京会议把亚非作家运动推进到了一个崭新的阶段。反帝革命的磅礴气概，洋溢在这次北京会议上。会议通过的公报和决议，坚决反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，特别是坚决反对亚非人民头号敌人美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，坚决支持亚洲、非洲和全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放斗争。会议的公报严正地谴责了破坏亚非作家团结的一切卑鄙阴谋。会议还通过决议，坚决反对西方帝国主义对亚非国家的文化侵略，要求发展亚非各国反帝革命的、人民大众的民族新文化。所有这一切，反映了亚非人民要团结、要独立、要自由，要把反帝革命进行到底的共同意志。
    越南是当前国际斗争中最激烈的战场，也是亚非人民反帝斗争的第一线。这次会议的中心议题，就是反对美帝国主义武装侵略越南，支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。亚非二十亿人民是同英勇战斗的越南人民站在一起的。越南人民在亚非人民和全世界人民的支持下，坚持抗美战争，就一定能够把美国侵略者从自己的国土上全部赶出去，取得抗美救国事业的最后胜利。而那些为美帝国主义奔走效劳，公开和暗中兜售约翰逊政府的“和谈”骗局的人，不仅是对越南人民革命事业的卑鄙出卖，也是对亚非人民革命事业的卑鄙出卖。他们这种肮脏的勾当，必将在越南人民和全世界人民反美的洪流中被揭露、被粉碎。
    目前，全世界的革命人民，特别是亚非人民，正在同以美国为首的帝国主义反革命力量进行着一场空前激烈的大搏斗。亿万人民不断地涌进革命的洪流，而一小部分假革命、反革命的垃圾和渣滓，必不可免地要被冲洗和扫除出去。苏联修正主义领导集团，竭力破坏亚非团结和亚非人民的革命事业，已经堕落成为美帝国主义的帮凶，它们就把自己放在同亚非人民和世界人民相敌对的地位。亚非人民和全世界人民正在进一步扩大和加强反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线。这是真正的而不是虚伪的、广泛的而不是狭隘的国际统一战线。它应当包括一切受到美帝国主义侵略、干涉、控制和欺负的国家和人民，但是绝不能包括苏联修正主义领导集团，因为它们是美帝国主义的帮凶和同谋者。在会议代表们的发言中，指出反对帝国主义必须反对修正主义，这完全不是偶然的。
    在这次北京的大会上，许多国家的代表在发言中，用最真挚的感情和最美好的语言来歌颂毛主席，歌颂毛泽东思想。他们说：毛主席是“世界人民的伟大导师和领袖”，是“中国和全世界的伟大舵手”，是“被压迫人民的最大希望”。他们说，伟大的毛泽东思想是“当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰”，是“全世界革命者的扑不灭的火炬和红太阳”，是“比原子弹更为强大的武器”。
    中国人民衷心地感谢亚非作家紧急会议对伟大的毛泽东思想作出的正确的国际的评价，感谢他们对中国革命和建设经验的赞扬。中国人民十分重视亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的反帝斗争经验，十分重视欧美人民的革命经验，认为这些经验都是值得中国人民学习的。
    这次会议正举行在我国无产阶级文化大革命蓬勃开展的高潮中。会议表明，亚非各国革命人民和进步作家从自己的切身经验深深体会到，被压迫民族和被压迫人民要彻底解放，不但要争取政治上的完全独立和经济上的自力更生，而且还必须坚决打倒帝国主义殖民主义的反动腐朽的旧文化旧思想，建立和发展自己的反帝革命的、人民大众的、民族的新文化新思想。这次会议在这方面作出的贡献，将大大有助于亚非人民反帝革命斗争的开展，并将给中国人民以巨大的鼓舞。
    我国广大人民对亚非作家朋友们表示了衷心的欢迎，对这次大会表示了热烈的支持。这生动地体现了中国人民和亚非人民之间的伟大团结和战斗友谊。我们尤其高兴的是，第三届亚非作家大会将要在北京举行。我们热烈地期待，在明年同亚非各国作家代表们再一次进行战斗的会晤，交流斗争的经验。
    毛主席指出：“帝国主义最怕的是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民觉悟，怕世界各国人民的觉悟。我们要团结起来把美帝国主义从亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲赶回它的老家去。”亚非作家、亚非人民团结起来！让我们更高地举起反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的战斗旗帜，向着光明的未来，奋勇前进！
