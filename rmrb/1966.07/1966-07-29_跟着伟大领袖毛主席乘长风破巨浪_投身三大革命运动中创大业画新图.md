All ethnic groups across the nation are overjoyed with class feelings and enthusiastically cheer for Chairman Mao's magnificent feat of swimming the Yangtze River. They resolutely decide to follow the great leader Chairman Mao with an indomitable revolutionary spirit, to fight against imperialism, revisionism, and representatives of the bourgeoisie, to trample all ghosts and monsters underfoot, to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and to build a more beautiful socialist motherland.

	New China News Agency, July 28th: People across the nation continue to cheer for the joyous news of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River. People are jubilant and inspired, pointing out that Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice is a great inspiration and education for the people of the entire nation. The sea voyage relies on the helmsman; we must forever follow Chairman Mao, with an indomitable revolutionary spirit, to fight against imperialism, revisionism, and representatives of the bourgeoisie, to trample all ghosts and monsters underfoot, to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and to build an even more beautiful socialist motherland.

	The joyous news reached the revolutionary old base areas of Yan'an, Jinggangshan, and Ruijin. The people in these areas are particularly elated. Everyone, with the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao, cheered: Long live Chairman Mao! We sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life.

	The people of Yan'an said: Since 1947, when Chairman Mao left Yan'an, the people of Yan'an have missed him day and night. Now, seeing our beloved leader Chairman Mao in such good health, this is the greatest happiness for the people of Yan'an. The Red Army soldiers and Eighth Route Army soldiers at the August 1st Old Soldiers' Home in Yan'an listened to this joyous news on the radio and some were so moved that they shed tears. Hu Peiyuan, an old Red Army soldier who followed Chairman Mao to Long March to Shaanxi, said: "Chairman Mao is the great revolutionary helmsman. No matter how big the waves are, with Chairman Mao at the helm, we can ride the wind and break the waves, invincible. On the Long March, we encountered all kinds of ghosts and monsters, faced countless difficulties, but because of Chairman Mao's correct leadership, we fear neither heaven nor earth, fear neither ghosts nor monsters, fear no hardships, and finally arrived in Shaanxi. I have been revolutionary with Chairman Mao for decades and deeply feel that following Chairman Mao is victory."

	Bai Yude, an old Red Guard who once led the people of Yan'an to welcome Chairman Mao, said: "Hearing the news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River, I am full of energy and can't help but shout long live Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the great savior of the people. We love Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao loves us. The people of Yan'an have gone through countless storms and difficulties with Chairman Mao, overcome one difficulty after another, and defeated one enemy after another. The people of Yan'an will forever be with Chairman Mao, generation after generation, forever following Chairman Mao."

	The poor and lower-middle peasants in the places where Chairman Mao stayed in Yan'an, such as Fenghuang Mountain, Zaoyuan, Yangjialing, and Wangjiaping, were particularly elated upon hearing this joyous news. Yang Chengfu, the former head of Zaoyuan Township, said: "Chairman Mao has always been fearless for the people. Chairman Mao's revolutionary will is the strongest. We must live to an old age, learn to an old age, and revolutionize to an old age with Chairman Mao." Yang Zaqing, an old poor peasant from Yangjialing Brigade, read in the newspaper that Chairman Mao said: "The Yangtze River, which everyone says is very big, is actually not frightening. Isn't the U.S. imperialism very big? We gave it a push, and it's nothing. So, some big things in the world are actually not frightening." He nodded repeatedly: "Chairman Mao's words are all truths. Twenty years ago, Chairman Mao told an American reporter in Yangjialing that 'all reactionaries are paper tigers.' Indeed, within three years, we used rice and rifles to defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries' planes and cannons; a few years later, we defeated the U.S. imperialism together with the Korean people. With Chairman Mao's good leadership, no matter what enemy or difficulty, it's nothing, all are paper tigers."

	The revolutionary teachers and students of Yan'an University, upon hearing the joyous news, sang "The East Is Red" in the afternoon and marched in formation to the Yanhe River for swimming. In the past few days, Yan'an region has had continuous heavy rain, making the Yanhe River's water rapid and the waves large, but the revolutionary teachers and students who went to the Yanhe River for swimming were unending every day. They, inspired by Chairman Mao's indomitable revolutionary spirit, decided to temper their revolutionary will to be even stronger in the great winds and waves.

	The people of Jinggangshan, the first revolutionary base area personally established by Chairman Mao, expressed that they followed Chairman Mao to revolutionize in the past, follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize now, and will forever follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize in the future.

	In the glorious old soldiers' home, revolutionary elders held a symposium with unlimited excitement. Revolutionary elder Ma Xiaoji said: "Chairman Mao's health and longevity are the most reliable guarantee for our country's socialist construction and the most reliable guarantee for anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism. I sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life." Luo Dongxiang, the former secretary of the New Sui Border Defense Special District Government, said excitedly: "Chairman Mao swam nearly thirty li in the Yangtze River, which is the greatest encouragement to all Chinese people. Chairman Mao teaches us that any difficulty is a paper tiger, and the U.S. imperialism is also a paper tiger. With Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, I believe that all difficulties can be overcome, and the U.S. imperialism will definitely be overthrown." Old Red Army platoon leader Lin Yunui said: "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts and the lighthouse for revolutionary people all over the world. With Chairman Mao's leadership, we fear no risks. The struggle led by Chairman Mao in Jinggangshan ignited the whole of China, and now revolutionary people all over the world are enthusiastically studying Chairman Mao's works. In the near future, the spark will definitely ignite the whole world."

	In the red capital Ruijin County, retired Long March old Red Army soldier and active learner of Chairman Mao's works Zeng Benzhen heard this joyous news on the radio and said excitedly: "Chairman Mao's health is our greatest happiness and pride. Hearing this news, I feel as if I have become younger, strengthening my determination to revolutionize forever and thoroughly in the great winds and waves. Although I have retired, my thoughts have not retired. In the future, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works even more diligently, forever follow the Party and Chairman Mao, continue to contribute to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and carry the revolution through to the end." Yang Yanqiu, an old Red Guard and national militia representative from Shazhou Bank Commune Shazhou Brigade, said: "Chairman Mao's health is the greatest happiness for the people of the red capital. Chairman Mao taught us in the land revolution period: to overcome all difficulties and bravely advance. Our Red Army followed Chairman Mao's instructions and won victories. In the future, I will follow the course opened by Chairman Mao, break the waves and advance, and pass on Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation."

	The joyous news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River also greatly inspired the people of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Zhejiang, Jilin, and other places. In the Nanjing Radio Factory, where Chairman Mao inspected ten years ago, Zhou Aqing, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and labor model of Nanjing City, heard the joyous news and reread the article "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" He said: "Three years ago, Chairman Mao specially wrote an article calling on us to throw ourselves into the three great revolutionary movements. Today, he swims in the surging Yangtze River, with great revolutionary practice, calling on us to temper ourselves in the great winds and waves. Chairman Mao, we will revolutionize for a lifetime, listen to your words for a lifetime, and act according to your instructions for a lifetime!" Yao Guangrong, a 54-year-old member of the Nanjing City Poor People's Association and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, looked at the photo of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River and laughed non-stop. She said: "Chairman Mao calls on us to temper ourselves in the great winds and waves, which is a call for us poor and lower-middle peasants to firmly fight against imperialism, revisionism, representatives of the bourgeoisie, and all ghosts and monsters! We will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words and pass on Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation."

	In Anhui, Sun Baohang, a model worker from the national model unit, Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, said: "Chairman Mao always encourages people to swim in rivers, lakes, and seas to temper their bodies, will, and courage, to struggle with nature, and to struggle with class enemies. We must forever follow Chairman Mao in the great winds and waves, fear no ghosts and monsters, fear no hardships, and bravely struggle for the thorough victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, for further improving socialist construction, and for promoting the world revolution." Wang Yuanliang, a model worker from the coal mining system and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works from the excavation area of Li Er Mine in Huainan Coal Mine, said: "The sea voyage relies on the helmsman. We workers will forever follow Chairman Mao, ride the wind and break the waves, and advance bravely!" Inspired by Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River, three thousand workers, peasants, students, and militiamen from Huainan City swam in the Huai River in the afternoon of the 25th, and the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao" echoed along both banks of the Huai River.

	Workers Wang Shumin from Jinan Locomotive Factory and Sun Shengyuan, a model militiaman from Jinan Automobile Manufacturing General Plant, upon hearing the joyous news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River, expressed their determination to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, grasp the laws of class struggle, carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end, and be prepared for all aspects of supporting Vietnam and fighting against the U.S. Hangzhou City is preparing to carry out large-scale activities to swim across the Qiantang River in response to Chairman Mao's great call. Zhu Dianjun, a poor peasant from Lanjia Commune in the suburbs of Changchun City, heard the joyous news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River and said: "Chairman Mao is the guide for us poor and lower-middle peasants. Under his leadership, we poor and lower-middle peasants have been liberated since liberation and have taken the path of cooperativization and communalization. His kindness to us poor and lower-middle peasants is higher than the sky and deeper than the sea. We will forever listen to Chairman Mao's words and advance with Chairman Mao."

	The joyous news of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River reached the front line of a certain artillery regiment in Fujian. The soldiers cheered for Chairman Mao's health and wished Chairman Mao a long life, determined to forever follow Chairman Mao in the great winds and waves.

    各族人民满怀阶级感情纵情欢呼毛主席畅游长江的壮举
    跟着伟大领袖毛主席乘长风破巨浪
    投身三大革命运动中创大业画新图
    决心以大无畏的革命精神，跟帝国主义斗，跟修正主义斗，跟资产阶级代表人物斗，把一切牛鬼蛇神踩在脚下，把社会主义革命进行到底，把社会主义祖国建设得更美好
    新华社二十八日讯  全国各民族人民继续欢呼最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席畅游长江的喜讯。人们欢欣鼓舞地指出，毛主席的伟大革命实践，是对全国人民的伟大启示和教育。大海航行靠舵手，我们一定要永远跟着毛主席，以大无畏的革命精神，跟帝国主义斗，跟修正主义斗，跟资产阶级代表人物斗，把一切牛鬼蛇神踩在脚下，把社会主义革命进行到底，把社会主义祖国建设得更加美好。
    喜讯传到革命老根据地延安、井冈山和瑞金等地区，这些地区的人民心情特别振奋。大家怀着对毛主席最深厚的感情欢呼：毛主席万岁，衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆。
    延安的人民说：毛主席自从一九四七年离开延安，延安人民日夜都想念着他。现在，看到我们敬爱的领袖毛主席身体这样健康，这是我们延安人民的最大幸福。延安八一敬老院的红军战士和八路军战士从收音机里听到这一喜讯时，有的激动得流了泪。跟随毛主席长征到达陕北的红军老战士胡培元说：“毛主席是伟大的革命舵手，不管风浪多大，有了毛主席掌舵，我们就能乘风破浪，无往不胜。在长征路上，我们遇到了种种牛鬼蛇神，碰到了重重困难，但是，由于毛主席的正确领导，我们不怕天，不怕地，不怕一切牛鬼蛇神，不怕任何艰难困苦，终于胜利地到达了陕北。我跟毛主席革命几十年，深深体会到，跟着毛主席走，就是胜利。”当年曾经领着延安人民迎接毛主席的老赤卫队员白玉德说：“听到毛主席畅游长江的消息，我浑身都是劲，不由得高呼毛主席万岁。毛主席是人民的大救星，我们爱毛主席，毛主席爱我们，我们延安人民跟着毛主席经过了多少大风大浪，克服了一个又一个的困难，打垮了一个又一个的敌人。我们延安人民永远和毛主席在一起，子子孙孙、世世代代都要永远跟着毛主席。”
    毛主席在延安住过的凤凰山、枣园、杨家岭、王家坪等地的贫农下中农，听到这一喜讯后格外振奋。当年枣园乡的乡长杨成富说：“毛主席为人民，向来不怕风险。毛主席的革命意志最坚强，我们一定要活到老，学到老，跟着毛主席革命到老。”杨家岭大队老贫农杨在青在报纸上看到毛主席说：长江，别人都说很大，其实，大，并不可怕。美帝国主义不是很大吗？我们顶了他一下，也没有啥。所以，世界上有些大的东西，其实并不可怕。他连连点头说：“毛主席的话句句是真理。二十年前毛主席就在我们杨家岭对一位美国记者说过‘一切反动派都是纸老虎’，果然，不出三年我们就用小米加步枪打垮了国民党反动派的飞机加大炮；再过几年，我们又同朝鲜人民一起打败了美帝国主义。我们有毛主席的好领导，不管是什么敌人，什么困难，都不在话下，都是纸老虎。”
    延安大学革命师生听到喜讯后，当天下午就高唱着《东方红》，整队前往延河游泳。最近几天延安地区连降暴雨，延河水急浪大，但是到延河游泳的革命师生，天天不断。他们在毛主席大无畏的革命气魄鼓舞下，决心在大风大浪中，把自己的革命意志锻炼得更加坚强。
    毛主席亲手创建的第一个革命根据地井冈山的人民表示，井冈山人民过去跟着毛主席干革命，现在跟着毛主席干革命，将来永远跟着毛主席干革命。
    在光荣敬老院里，革命老人怀着无限激动的心情举行了座谈会。革命老人马夏姬说：“毛主席健康长寿，是我国社会主义建设的最可靠的保证，是反帝反修的最可靠的保证。我衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆。”当年新遂边防特别区工农兵政府秘书罗冬祥激动地说：“毛主席畅游长江近三十里，这是对全中国人民的最大鼓舞。毛主席教导我们，任何困难都是纸老虎，美帝国主义也是纸老虎。有了毛主席的英明领导，我相信什么困难都可以克服，美帝国主义也一定能被打倒。”当年老红军排长林润贵说：“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，是全世界革命人民的灯塔，有了毛主席的领导，任何风险也不怕。毛主席领导的井冈山斗争，星星之火燃遍了全中国，现在全世界革命人民都在热烈学习毛主席著作，不久的将来，星星之火也一定要燃遍全世界。”
    在红色故都瑞金县，退休长征老红军、学习毛主席著作积极分子曾本津从广播中听到这个喜讯后，激动地说：“毛主席的健康，是我们莫大的幸福和骄傲。我听到这个消息，仿佛年轻了好多，增强了我在大风大浪中永远革命、彻底革命的决心。我虽然人退休了，但我的思想没有退休，今后我一定更加努力学习毛主席著作。永远跟着党和毛主席，继续为中国革命和世界革命贡献出自己的力量，将革命进行到底。”沙洲坝公社沙洲大队老赤卫队员、全国民兵代表杨衍球说：“毛主席的健康是我们红都人民的最大幸福。毛主席在土地革命时期就教导我们：要克服一切困难，勇敢前进。我们红军遵照毛主席的指示，就打胜仗，取得了胜利。今后，我要沿着毛主席开辟的航道，破浪前进，把毛泽东思想代代相传。”
    毛主席畅游长江的喜讯，也极大地鼓舞了江苏、安徽、山东、浙江、吉林等地的人民群众。在毛主席十年前视察过的南京无线电厂，学习毛主席著作积极分子、南京市劳动模范周阿庆听到喜讯后，又重读了《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》这篇文章，他说：“三年前，毛主席专门写文章号召我们投身到三大革命运动中去，今天他又到汹涌的长江中去游泳，以伟大的革命实践，号召我们到大风大浪中去锻炼。毛主席，我们要革命一辈子，要一辈子听您的话，一辈子照您的指示办事！”五十四岁的南京市贫协委员、学习毛主席著作积极分子姚光荣，激动地望着毛主席畅游长江的照片笑个不停，她说：“毛主席号召我们要到大风大浪中去经受锻炼，就是号召我们贫农下中农要坚决跟帝国主义斗、跟修正主义斗、跟资产阶级代表人物斗、跟一切牛鬼蛇神斗！我们要坚决听毛主席的话，要把毛泽东思想世世代代传下去。”
    在安徽，全国大庆式先进单位、马鞍山钢铁公司的五好工人孙保航说：“毛主席总是鼓励人们到江河湖海里去锻炼身体，锻炼意志和勇敢，去同大自然搏斗，同阶级敌人搏斗。我们一定要永远跟着毛主席在大风浪中前进，不怕一切牛鬼蛇神，不怕一切艰难困苦，为无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，为进一步搞好社会主义建设，为促进世界革命而勇敢斗争。”淮南煤矿李二矿掘进区五好职工、全国煤炭系统学习毛主席著作积极分子翁元良说：“大海航行靠舵手，我们工人将永远跟着毛主席，乘风破浪，奋勇前进！”在毛主席畅游长江的鼓舞下，淮南市三千名工人、农民、学生和民兵，在二十五日下午来到淮河里游泳，“毛主席万岁”的口号声响彻淮河两岸。
    济南机车工厂工人王淑敏、济南汽车制造总厂五好民兵孙胜远，听到毛主席畅游长江的喜讯后，表示决心活学活用毛主席著作，掌握阶级斗争的规律，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；并做好援越抗美的一切准备。杭州市为了响应毛主席的伟大号召，正准备开展大规模的横渡钱塘江的活动。长春市郊区兰家公社贫农社员朱殿君听到毛主席畅游长江的喜讯后说：“毛主席是咱贫农下中农的引路人。在他的领导下，解放后咱们贫农下中农翻了身，又走上合作化、公社化的道路。他对咱贫农下中农的恩情比天还高，比海还深。我们要永远听毛主席的话，跟着毛主席前进。”（附图片）
