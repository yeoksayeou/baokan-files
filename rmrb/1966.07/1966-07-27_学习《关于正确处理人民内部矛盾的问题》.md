The editorial board of the *Liberation Army Daily* notes: Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is a brilliant document of Marxism-Leninism with epoch-making significance. In this great work, Chairman Mao, summarizing the historical experiences of the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship in China and internationally, for the first time comprehensively, systematically, and profoundly analyzed the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society. He put forward the brilliant judgment of correctly distinguishing and correctly handling two types of contradictions of different natures. He creatively inherited and developed the Marxist-Leninist theory on the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, laying the theoretical foundation for our party's line, policies, and principles during the entire period of socialist revolution and socialist construction. This great work is the great guideline for us to successfully carry out the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. It is a powerful ideological weapon for us to oppose imperialism, oppose modern revisionism, and prevent the restoration of capitalism. It has extremely important practical significance and profound strategic significance for advancing China's socialist cause, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensuring China's gradual transition to communism. It also has a significant impact on promoting the development of the international communist movement.

Currently, China is deeply engaged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for power, and a great ideological revolution for the masses to educate themselves. In this extremely complex, sharp, and profound class struggle, there are both contradictions between the enemy and us, and contradictions among the people. The two types of contradictions and struggles of different natures are intertwined. Under these circumstances, the primary task facing the revolutionary warriors of the proletariat is to correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions of different natures, to differentiate between the enemy and us, and to discern right from wrong. Only by correctly solving this problem can we expose the small handful of anti-party, anti-socialist counter-revolutionary cliques disguised in various ways and, through struggle, thoroughly defeat them. Only by correctly solving this problem can we unite more than 95% of the cadres and more than 95% of the masses, promote the ideological transformation of the broad masses, mobilize all positive factors, and build socialism quickly, efficiently, and economically.

The brilliant thoughts in Chairman Mao's great work are the guiding light for our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the political telescope and microscope, the sole criterion for distinguishing between flowers and weeds, between revolution and counter-revolution, between true revolution and false revolution, between Marxism and revisionism. It is the most powerful ideological weapon for us to thoroughly defeat all ghosts and monsters, thoroughly criticize all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. The cadres and soldiers of our army must, in the great waves of class struggle, better study and apply Chairman Mao's great work, master and use this invincible ideological weapon, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

To help comrades study this great work, we have compiled this guide for reference by the comrades in the units.

Historical Background

"On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was a speech given by Chairman Mao at the Eleventh (Expanded) Session of the State Council on February 27, 1957, and published in the *People's Daily* on June 19 of the same year.

In 1957, China had basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, establishing a socialist economic system based on public ownership of the means of production. At the same time, the first Five-Year Plan for national economic development was completed ahead of schedule, laying the initial foundation for socialist industrialization. The Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, were united in carrying out the great socialist construction.

However, there were still contradictions between the enemy and us, and contradictions among the people in Chinese society. The main situation was as follows: (1) The large-scale, stormy class struggles of the revolutionary period had basically ended, but the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador class still existed, the bourgeoisie still existed, and the petty bourgeoisie had just begun to be transformed. Class struggle had not ended. (2) The broad masses, mainly the urban and rural petty bourgeoisie, welcomed the new system on the one hand, but on the other hand, due to the influence of old habits, they were not very accustomed to or adapted to the new system. (3) The experience of government officials was still not rich, and there were still some shortcomings and mistakes in specific work. Some specific policy issues still needed to be further investigated and explored. This caused some contradictions between the government and the people.

Due to the existence of two types of contradictions of different natures and the fact that class struggle permeated these contradictions, a complex struggle situation was formed. Some enemies hid among the people, using the contradictions among the people to sow discord, stir up trouble, and attempt to achieve counter-revolutionary restoration. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, which was the main contradiction of the socialist period, and the struggle between socialism and capitalism, in some areas, manifested as fierce, life-and-death contradictions between the enemy and us. In most cases, it manifested as contradictions among the people.

In the face of this complex class struggle situation, many people were confused in their thinking. Some people did not admit that there were still contradictions in socialist society, making them hesitant and passive in the face of social contradictions. Some people thought that there were no more counter-revolutionaries, no more class struggles, and that the world was peaceful, often leading them to confuse the enemy with us. Some people did not dare to openly admit that there were still contradictions among the Chinese people and did not understand that it was these contradictions that pushed our society forward. This made them panic when certain contradictions among the people surfaced, treating contradictions among the people as contradictions between the enemy and us. In this situation, how to draw the line between the two types of contradictions of different natures and correctly handle the contradictions among the people became a major issue facing the entire Party and the people of the whole country.

At that time, in the international communist movement, a countercurrent emerged. In February 1956, at the infamous 20th Congress of the CPSU, the traitor Khrushchev launched a massive attack on Stalin, proposing a revisionist line of peaceful coexistence, peaceful transition, and peaceful competition, fundamentally denying the Marxist-Leninist theory on class, class struggle, proletarian revolution, and proletarian dictatorship. This took the leadership of the CPSU onto the decisive first step on the road to restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union. Due to the betrayal of the CPSU leadership and the incitement of imperialism and reactionaries in various countries, a counter-revolutionary countercurrent emerged in various places around the world. The counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary in October 1956 was a prominent event. This caused great confusion in the international communist movement, and the revisionist tide began to spread widely.

The sharp and complex class struggles at home and abroad raised a series of fundamental questions about proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship that needed to be answered. It was under this situation that Chairman Mao delivered this great work, correctly answering and solving these fundamental questions.

Great Significance

Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is a great, brilliant work of Marxism-Leninism. In this work, Chairman Mao not only scientifically summarized the basic experiences of the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship in China but also scientifically summarized the basic experiences of the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship since the Great October Socialist Revolution. For the first time, he comprehensively and profoundly analyzed the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society, and put forward the brilliant judgment of correctly distinguishing and correctly handling the two types of contradictions of different natures. He creatively inherited and developed the Marxist-Leninist theory on proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao's great work is a great contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory. Its publication has epoch-making significance in the development of China's revolution and the international communist movement.

In this great work, Chairman Mao insisted on and developed the thorough revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism, laying the theoretical foundation for our party's line, policies, and principles during the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The brilliant thoughts in this work are the great guideline for us to successfully carry out the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. It is a powerful ideological weapon for us to oppose modern revisionism and prevent the restoration of capitalism. It is the highest directive for us to successfully carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction. It is the sole criterion for us to distinguish between the enemy and us and to discern right from wrong. At the same time, this work also clarified some confused notions that had long existed in the international communist movement, powerfully refuted the attacks of imperialism and traitors of the proletariat on the socialist system, and became a programmatic document for uniting all revolutionary people, opposing modern revisionism centered on the CPSU leadership, and advancing the international communist movement.

Chairman Mao's work and "On the Work of Propaganda in the Party" are the latest summaries of the historical experiences of revolutionary thought and art movements in China and other countries. They are the new development of Marxist-Leninist worldview and art theory. They are powerful ideological weapons for eliminating the old and establishing the new, and sweeping away all ghosts and monsters. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seriously studying this work has extremely important practical guiding significance.

Main Content

In this work, Chairman Mao discussed twelve issues.

1. Two Types of Contradictions of Different Natures. In China, there are two types of social contradictions: contradictions between the enemy and us, and contradictions among the people. All classes, strata, and social groups that support, endorse, and participate in the socialist construction cause belong to the people's ranks. All social forces and social groups that resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to and sabotage socialist construction are the people's enemies. The nature of the contradictions is different, and the methods of resolving the contradictions are also different. Use the method of dictatorship to resolve contradictions between the enemy and us. Use the method of democracy to resolve contradictions among the people.

The law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe. This law exists universally in nature, human society, and human thought. There are still contradictions in socialist society. The basic contradiction remains that between the productive relations and productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base. However, it is fundamentally different from the contradictions in the old society. In China, class, class contradictions, and class struggle still exist. At this time, it is necessary to correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions.

2. The Problem of Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries. The problem of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is a problem of struggle between the enemy and us. We have basically suppressed the counter-revolutionaries thoroughly, which is one of the important reasons for the consolidation of our country. The achievements of our suppression work are primary. The principle of our suppression work is: "Suppress counter-revolutionaries where there are any, and correct mistakes where there are any." Our line in suppression work is the line of mass suppression. The hidden counter-revolutionaries who have not been suppressed will not give up. The American imperialists and the Kuomintang clique still frequently send spies to our country to carry out sabotage activities. It is possible that new counter-revolutionaries will appear in China. We must never let down our guard.

3. The Problem of Agricultural Cooperativization. China has more than 500 million agricultural population. The situation of the peasants is crucial to the development of China's economy and the consolidation of political power. After the establishment of cooperatives, it is still necessary to go through many struggles to gradually consolidate them. It is necessary to constantly pay attention to handling various contradictions in production and distribution issues. Correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual.

4. The Problem of Industrialists and Businessmen. The transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises into joint state-private enterprises has not completely resolved the contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie still has two aspects. In the process of building socialism, everyone needs to be transformed, but the transformation of the exploiters and the laborers is of two different natures.

5. The Problem of Intellectuals. All intellectuals who genuinely wish to serve the socialist cause should be trusted, united, and educated, and their talents should be utilized. The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation. Intellectuals must continue to transform themselves, discard the bourgeois worldview, and establish the proletarian worldview. Without correct political views, it is as if one has no soul. It is necessary to strengthen ideological and political work among intellectuals and young students. Our educational policy should enable the educated to develop in all aspects of moral education, intellectual education, and physical education, becoming socially conscious and cultured laborers. It is necessary to conduct education on thrift and self-reliance among the youth.

6. The Problem of National Minorities. The relationship between the Han nationality and the national minorities must be handled well. Whether it is Han chauvinism or local nationalism, it is not conducive to the unity of all nationalities, which is a kind of contradiction among the people that needs to be overcome.

7. Comprehensive Planning and Appropriate Arrangement. When we make plans, do things, and think about problems, we must start from the fact that China has 600 million people. We must mobilize all positive factors, unite all possible people, and as far as possible, turn negative factors into positive factors to serve the great cause of building a socialist society.

8. On the Policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," and "Long-Term Coexistence and Mutual Supervision." The policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is a policy to promote the development of art and the progress of science, and a policy to promote the prosperity of socialist culture in China. In China, class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very fierce. The struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological realm will take a considerable amount of time to resolve. Marxism develops in struggle. The thoughts of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie will inevitably be reflected tenaciously. There are errors that need to be criticized, and there are weeds that need to be fought against. Revisionism is a bourgeois trend of thought, and it is more dangerous than dogmatism. It is the best assistant for the bourgeoisie to restore capitalism. There are six political criteria for distinguishing between flowers and weeds, the most important of which are the socialist road and the leadership of the Party. All democratic parties must pay attention to ideological transformation, strive to coexist and supervise each other with the Communist Party for a long time, and adapt to the needs of the new society.

9. On the Problem of a Few People Causing Trouble. We do not approve of causing trouble, as it is not conducive to the development of the socialist cause. It is necessary to resolutely overcome bureaucracy and strengthen ideological and political education, and appropriately handle various contradictions. If trouble is caused, it should be used as a special means to improve work, educate cadres, and the masses. For a few people who commit crimes, necessary legal sanctions must be imposed.

10. Can Bad Things Turn into Good Things? We must learn to look at problems comprehensively. Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results. The opposing sides of a contradiction, in their struggle with each other, inevitably transform into each other under certain conditions. Our attitude towards imperialism launching wars is the same as our attitude towards all "troubles": first, oppose; second, do not fear.

11. On Thrift. The 600 million people in China must all practice increased production and thrift, opposing extravagance and waste. This has not only great economic significance but also great political significance. To make China rich and strong, it will take decades of hard struggle, including the implementation of the policy of thrift and self-reliance.

12. The Road to China's Industrialization. China is a large agricultural country, and the development of industry must be carried out simultaneously with the development of agriculture. Without agriculture, there is no light industry. With the development of agriculture and light industry, heavy industry will have a market and funds, and will develop even faster. The contradiction between the objective laws of economic development in socialist society and our subjective understanding needs to be resolved in practice.

Key Points to Grasp

In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when studying Chairman Mao's great work, the following points should be emphasized:

1. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm will, for a considerable period, be a very complex, sharp, and life-and-death struggle.

Chairman Mao said: "In China, although the socialist transformation in terms of ownership has been basically completed, and the large-scale, stormy class struggles of the revolutionary period have basically ended, the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador class still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie has just begun to be transformed. Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm are long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very fierce. The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview. In this regard, the question of who wins between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved." To thoroughly resolve this question, it will take a hundred to several hundred years, and it will require extremely complex and sharp class struggles. If the proletariat does not insist on class struggle against the bourgeoisie and does not resolutely carry the socialist revolution through to the end, our party and state will change color, capitalism will be restored in China, and the victory of the world revolution will be greatly delayed.

The class struggle in the ideological realm is a very important front. Revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries both attach importance to the role of ideology. We must develop the proletarian ideology to promote social progress. Domestic and foreign class enemies, in their conspiracy to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration, first focus on ideology, superstructure, theory, academia, literature, and other spiritual aspects, creating public opinion for their counter-revolutionary restoration. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the exposed "Three Families" are frantically seizing the ideological realm, preparing public opinion for their restoration of capitalism. We must never underestimate the class struggle in the ideological realm.

The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm is long-term. Because the transformation of the worldview of the bourgeoisie and its intellectuals is long-term. The economic base that produces this worldview no longer exists, but the reactionary worldview that reflects the old system and serves the old system will still exist for a long time. The exploitative classes ruled over the laboring people for thousands of years, and their reactionary thoughts and culture cannot but have a wide influence in society. The spontaneous capitalist tendencies and habits of the petty bourgeoisie are the soil in which the reactionary thoughts and culture of the exploitative classes exist and spread their influence. At the same time, international imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries constantly and unceasingly, through various channels and in various ways, spread bourgeois ideological poison, attempting to achieve the "peaceful evolution" of capitalism in China. To thoroughly defeat bourgeois ideology and thoroughly eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology and culture, it cannot but be a long-term and serious class struggle. If we do not have a sufficient understanding of the long-term nature of this struggle, we will make great mistakes.

The class struggle in the ideological realm is extremely complex. This struggle manifests both as contradictions between the enemy and us, and as contradictions among the people, and these two types of contradictions of different natures are often intertwined. In the context of the powerful dictatorship of the proletariat, the love of all the people for Chairman Mao, and the deep-rooted Mao Zedong Thought in China, a new feature of the counter-revolutionaries' anti-party and anti-socialist activities is to wave the "red flag" to oppose the "red flag," wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The class struggle in society will inevitably be reflected within our party. The domestic class struggle is also always linked with the international class struggle. This requires us to heighten our revolutionary vigilance, be good at analyzing various situations, timely expose the conspiracies of counter-revolutionaries, and correctly distinguish and handle the two types of contradictions of different natures.

The struggle to eliminate the old and establish the new in the ideological realm is sometimes very fierce. Although the landlord and bourgeoisie have been overthrown, they are still alive and their hearts are not dead. They strive to defend the ideological realm, the last stronghold, placing their hopes for restoration on the struggle in the ideological realm. If you do not fight them, they will fight you; if you do not defeat them, they will defeat you. This is a life-and-death struggle of restoration and anti-restoration. The proletariat must thoroughly smash all challenges and attacks of the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm to achieve the final victory.

The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a very complex, sharp, and profound class struggle in the ideological realm. This struggle, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, is to gradually resolve the question of who wins between socialism and capitalism in the ideological realm and to carry the socialist revolution through to the end. Our army is the most obedient tool of the Party, created by Chairman Mao, and the main pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Every cadre and soldier must actively participate in this great struggle, together with the revolutionary people of the whole country, hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly criticize the crimes of the anti-party cliques, smash their counter-revolutionary conspiracies in the ideological realm to restore capitalism, thoroughly criticize the old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie, create new thoughts, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat, and be tempered and improved in the great waves of class struggle.

2. Correctly Distinguish the Two Types of Contradictions of Different Natures and Draw the Line Between the Enemy and Us.

Correctly distinguishing between contradictions between the enemy and us and contradictions among the people, and drawing the line between the enemy and us, is the prerequisite for correctly handling the two types of contradictions of different natures.

Chairman Mao pointed out: The concepts of the people and the enemy have different contents in different countries and in different historical periods of various countries. In the current stage of China, "In the period of building socialism, all classes, strata, and social groups that support, endorse, and participate in the socialist construction cause belong to the people's ranks; all social forces and social groups that resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to and sabotage socialist construction are the people's enemies." The contradictions between the enemy and us are antagonistic contradictions, which are fundamental conflicts of interest between opposing classes. "The contradictions among the people, among the laboring people, are non-antagonistic; among the exploited classes and the exploiting classes, in addition to the antagonistic aspect, there is also a non-antagonistic aspect." "Generally speaking, the contradictions among the people are contradictions based on the fundamental unity of the people's interests." Chairman Mao's instructions are the fundamental basis for us to distinguish between the enemy and us and correctly distinguish the two types of contradictions.

China's socialist revolution and socialist construction are being carried out under the correct leadership of our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Great Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our party, the guiding light for us to carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and a powerful ideological weapon for us to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. All revolutionary enemies who conspire to restore the old system and carry out counter-revolutionary coups direct their attacks at Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, the dividing line between the people and the enemy is concentrated on whether one supports or opposes Mao Zedong Thought.

In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, all the ghosts and monsters exposed are those who deeply hate and attack Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to overthrow the Party's leadership, abolish the socialist system, and achieve the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, the contradictions between them and us are contradictions between the enemy and us, which are irreconcilable life-and-death struggles. The target of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the small handful of representatives of the bourgeoisie who are anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. As for the general bourgeois intellectuals, as long as they are not anti-communist and anti-people, and are willing to transform their worldview under the leadership of our party using Mao Zedong Thought, criticize and overcome their bourgeois thoughts, and walk the socialist road with the people of the whole country, then the contradictions between them and us still belong to contradictions among the people.

In this great work, Chairman Mao also specially reminded us that the class struggle in the socialist period is extremely complex, and the contradictions between the enemy and us and the contradictions among the people are often intertwined, making it easy to confuse them. Therefore, it is necessary to pay special attention to drawing the line between the enemy and us. The representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party, government, army, and cultural circles, occupying important positions, wave the "red flag" to oppose the "red flag," wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Those hidden counter-revolutionaries will also appear in "revolutionary" disguises, taking the opportunity to cause trouble and sabotage our revolutionary cause. Therefore, in this complex class struggle, whether or not we can correctly draw the line between the two types of contradictions and accurately expose various disguised enemies is the key to correctly handling the two types of contradictions.

In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, how can we correctly distinguish the two types of contradictions and expose the disguised enemies? The fundamental issue is that only by mastering and using Mao Zedong Thought, this political microscope and telescope, can we see through the surface and grasp the essence, dispel the fog, and see through everything, making all kinds of ghosts and monsters have nowhere to hide. At the same time, we must, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, trust the masses, rely on the masses, and mobilize the masses to launch mass movements. We, with Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, and closely relying on the broad masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, can, in the complex class struggle, correctly distinguish the two types of contradictions of different natures, draw the line between the enemy and us, and expose all ghosts and monsters in broad daylight.

3. According to the Different Nature of the Contradictions, Adopt Different Methods to Correctly Handle the Contradictions Between the Enemy and Us and the Contradictions Among the People.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The methods of resolving the two types of contradictions of different natures, between the enemy and us and among the people, are different." For the contradictions between the enemy and us, we must adopt the method of dictatorship to resolve them, that is, to suppress the class enemies, deprive them of their right to speak, allow them to behave only in an orderly manner, and not allow them to make trouble. If we do not do this, the revolution will fail, the people will suffer, and the country will perish.

For the contradictions among the people, we must adopt democratic methods, methods of discussion, criticism, persuasion, and education to resolve them, and not use coercive and suppressive methods. Chairman Mao summarized our party's historical experience in correctly handling the contradictions among the people, summing it up in a formula: unity—criticism—unity. That is, starting from the desire for unity, through criticism or struggle, the contradictions are resolved, and on this basis, new unity is achieved. This is our consistent and unshakable policy for correctly handling the contradictions among the people. Currently, the target of the struggle in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to concentrate forces to strike at the small handful of counter-revolutionaries who make up a few percent of the total population, who are die-hard anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought elements. For the vast majority, we have been, are, and will continue to adopt the policy of unity—criticism—unity.

To correctly handle the two types of contradictions of different natures, we must insist on the Party's leadership. All the undertakings and struggles of the Chinese people have been achieved under the correct leadership of our party. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can only be victorious under the leadership of the party. Our party is a glorious, great, and correct party. Our party has the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the ideological foundation for the unity and revolution of the whole party, and has the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Chairman Mao as the core. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the organizations of our party at all levels, our party members, and our party cadres are mostly good, loyal to the proletariat, loyal to the communist cause, and loyal to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The anti-party and anti-socialist elements are only a small handful. Some party members, although temporarily deceived by the class enemies who have infiltrated the party, immediately take action and join the battle after these class enemies are exposed. Some party members, although they have different degrees of shortcomings and mistakes, can be corrected under the help, education, and supervision of the party and the masses, through criticism and self-criticism. Many can be corrected.

Organized and led actions are the most effective revolutionary actions. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must, under the correct leadership of the party, organize more closely, unite more closely, heighten class consciousness, heighten revolutionary vigilance, and prevent the enemy from taking advantage of loopholes. We must closely monitor the actions of the class enemies, timely expose all their conspiracies and tricks, and never allow them to fish in troubled waters and gain advantages.

Insisting on the Party's leadership is to insist on acting according to the Party's policies. The Party's line, principles, and policies are formulated with Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding light. The Party's policies are our magic weapon for defeating the enemy. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must consistently implement the Party's policies, pay attention to the methods and strategies of struggle. Only in this way can the struggle advance victoriously on the track determined by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, correctly handle the two types of contradictions of different natures, promote the transformation of contradictions in a direction favorable to us, and turn bad things into good things.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to correctly handle the two types of contradictions of different natures, we must, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, mobilize the masses, give the policies to the masses, firmly rely on the proletarian leftists and the broad revolutionary masses, to distinguish between the enemy and us, discern right from wrong, and only through struggle can we unite more than 95% of the people, thoroughly isolate and defeat the small handful of class enemies who are anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, and while struggling against the class enemies, promote the ideological transformation of the broad masses.

4. Implement the Party's Policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," Use the Political Standards of the Proletariat to Distinguish Between Flowers and Weeds, and Thoroughly Criticize All Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Counter-Revolutionary Words and Deeds.

Chairman Mao said, the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is "proposed on the basis of acknowledging that various contradictions still exist in socialist society, and on the urgent need of the state to rapidly develop the economy and culture." This policy is a policy to promote the development of art and the progress of science, and a policy to promote the prosperity of socialist culture in China. This slogan is proposed from the standpoint of the proletariat, from the standpoint of consolidating the socialist system and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and from the standpoint of developing the new thoughts, new culture, new customs, and new habits of socialism, criticizing and eliminating the old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. Therefore, the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is the firm revolutionary class policy of the proletariat, and not the bourgeois "liberalization."

In the ideological and cultural realm, we allow people to freely discuss and debate different opinions among the people, and through free discussion and debate, discern right from wrong. However, for those anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought weeds, we absolutely cannot give them this freedom, and we absolutely cannot give them the right to exist legally. Chairman Mao said: "There are errors that need to be criticized, and there are weeds that need to be fought against." A small handful of representatives of the bourgeoisie maliciously distort the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," erasing its class content. They treat weeds as flowers and, under the pretext of "letting them blossom," allow the bourgeois "experts," "scholars," and "authorities" to spread poison, allow all ghosts and monsters to come out, and do not allow the proletariat to counterattack. This is a big conspiracy.

Chairman Mao, based on the interests of the proletariat, proposed six political criteria for distinguishing between flowers and weeds: "(1) Beneficial to uniting the people of all nationalities in China, not to splitting the people; (2) Beneficial to the socialist transformation and socialist construction, not detrimental to the socialist transformation and socialist construction; (3) Beneficial to consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, not to undermining or weakening this dictatorship; (4) Beneficial to consolidating the democratic centralism, not to undermining or weakening this system; (5) Beneficial to consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party, not to abandoning or weakening this leadership; (6) Beneficial to the international unity of socialism and the international unity of all peace-loving people in the world, not to harming these unities. Among these six criteria, the most important are the socialist road and the leadership of the Party." Great Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our party and the guiding light for us to walk the socialist road. Therefore, the fundamental dividing line between flowers and weeds is whether they support or oppose Mao Zedong Thought.

The small handful of representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party treat the political issue of being anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought as a "purely academic" issue. This is pure deception. In a society with class struggle, any academic discipline serves either this class or that class. They use the pretext of "purely academic" issues to cover up the ghosts and monsters, trying to reverse the political direction of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is sheer fantasy.

The policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" proposed by Chairman Mao embodies our party's mass line and the class line of the proletariat. Only the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main body of "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have become the main force of the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, seizing the cultural hegemony from the bourgeois "authorities." This is a matter of epoch-making significance.

5. All Revolutionary Intellectuals and Revolutionaries Must Transform Their Worldview and Achieve Ideological Transformation. The Cultural and Educational Departments and All Other Departments Must Promote Proletarian Politics, Use Mao Zedong Thought to Guide Everything, and Transform Everything.

Chairman Mao said: "Without correct political views, it is as if one has no soul." Chairman Mao raised a very important issue here, which is that all revolutionaries must use proletarian thoughts to guide their thoughts and actions, to transform their worldview; the cultural and educational departments and all other departments must implement proletarian politics. In a word, politics must be prominent.

Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation. At present, most intellectuals cannot be said to have completed this transformation." In the more than ten years since liberation, although the transformation of intellectuals has achieved some results, except for a small handful of reactionary bourgeois intellectuals who are extremely hostile to the socialist cause, most intellectuals have made varying degrees of progress. However, the transformation of worldview is a fundamental change in class standpoint and class feelings. Without high self-awareness, without going through a long-term, arduous process of practical tempering and ideological struggle, it is impossible to truly complete this transformation. From the problems exposed in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some intellectuals, influenced by the black line, consciously or unconsciously follow it and serve it, precisely because their bourgeois worldview has not been fundamentally transformed. Therefore, all revolutionary intellectuals and revolutionaries must, in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that touches the soul, resolutely draw a clear line with the small handful of black gang members, thoroughly criticize their counter-revolutionary words and deeds, and at the same time, seriously cleanse the bourgeois thoughts from their minds, accelerate the ideological transformation, and make our work better and better.

In the cultural and educational departments and all departments, promoting proletarian politics is a fundamental issue. Whether or not to promote proletarian politics, whether or not to carry out the ideological transformation of people, whether or not to carry out class struggle, is the issue of whether or not to adhere to the socialist direction, whether or not to have the dictatorship of the proletariat, and whether or not to have the leadership of the proletarian party. Ultimately, it is the issue of whether or not to hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, whether or not to adhere to the revolution. This is related to whether the socialist society develops and progresses or regresses and degenerates.

Our work has thousands of items, but the most important first item is to promote politics and promote Mao Zedong Thought. The view that puts business and technology in the first place is actually a bourgeois politics. It leads people to the road of bourgeois individualism and the road of revisionism.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Our country is a great socialist country under the dictatorship of the proletariat, with 700 million people, and it needs a unified thought, a revolutionary thought, a correct thought, which is Mao Zedong Thought. 'We must, through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, spread Mao Zedong Thought among the workers and peasants, so as to change the spiritual face of the laboring people, and transform spiritual strength into great material strength.' The cultural and educational departments and all departments must promote proletarian politics, hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and must take Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive for all work. The literary and artistic line and educational policy of Chairman Mao must be firmly implemented, and the educational system must be thoroughly reformed. It is necessary to strengthen political and ideological work, take Chairman Mao's books as a compulsory course, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform everything, guide everything, mobilize all positive factors, and strive for the great cause of socialism and communism to the end."

    学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》
    《解放军报》编者按：毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，是一部具有划时代意义的马克思列宁主义的光辉文献。毛主席在这部伟大著作中，总结了我国和国际无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的历史经验，第一次全面地、系统地、深刻地分析了社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争，提出了正确区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾的英明论断，天才地、创造性地继承和发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说，为我们党在整个社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期的路线、方针、政策奠定了理论基础。这部伟大著作，是指导我们胜利地开展阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验这三大革命运动的伟大纲领，是我们反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义、防止资本主义复辟的强大的思想武器。它对于推进我国的社会主义事业，巩固无产阶级专政，并保证我国逐步向共产主义过渡，对于推动国际共产主义运动的发展，具有极其重大的现实意义和极其深远的战略意义。
    当前，我国正在深入开展的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场无产阶级同资产阶级之间你死我活的夺权斗争，也是一场广大群众进行自我教育的思想革命运动。在这场极其复杂、极其尖锐和极其深刻的阶级斗争中，既有敌我矛盾，又有人民内部矛盾，两类不同性质的矛盾和斗争交织在一起。在这种情况下，摆在我们无产阶级革命战士面前的一个首要的问题，就是正确区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，分清敌我，明辨是非。只有正确地解决这个问题，才能把披着形形色色伪装的一小撮反党反社会主义的反革命黑帮揪出来，经过斗争，彻底战胜他们。也只有正确地解决了这个问题，才能团结百分之九十五以上的干部，团结百分之九十五以上的群众，促进广大群众的思想革命化，调动起一切积极因素，多快好省地建设社会主义。
    毛主席这部伟大著作的光辉思想，是我们无产阶级文化大革命的指路明灯，是我们政治上的望远镜和显微镜，是我们识别香花与毒草，识别革命与反革命、真革命与假革命、马克思主义与修正主义的唯一标准，是我们彻底战胜一切牛鬼蛇神，彻底批判一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的最强大的思想武器。
    我军干部战士一定要在这场阶级斗争的大风大浪中，更好地活学活用毛主席这部伟大著作，掌握和运用这个战无不胜的思想武器，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    为了帮助同志们学好这部伟大著作，我们编写了这个辅导材料，供连队的同志们学习参考。
    历史背景
    《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》是一九五七年二月二十七日，毛主席在最高国务会议第十一次
  （扩大）会议上的讲话。同年六月十九日在《人民日报》发表。
    一九五七年，正是我国基本上完成了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，建立了以生产资料公有制为基础的社会主义经济体系。同时，提前完成了第一个发展国民经济的五年计划，建立了社会主义工业化的初步基础。我国人民正在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，团结一致地进行着伟大的社会主义建设。
    但是，我国社会还存在着敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。主要情况是：（一）革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争已经基本结束，但是，被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。（二）广大群众，主要是城乡小资产阶级，一面欢迎新制度，一面又由于旧的习惯势力的影响，对新制度感到不大习惯、不大适应。（三）政府工作人员的经验还不够丰富，在具体工作中还存在着一些缺点和错误，对一些具体政策的问题，还需要继续考察和探索。这就使得政府和人民之间，还存在着一定的矛盾。
    由于两类不同性质的矛盾的存在，由于阶级斗争贯穿在两类不同性质的矛盾中，这就形成了一个错综复杂的斗争形势。有些敌人钻在人民内部，利用人民内部的矛盾，挑拨离间，兴风作浪，企图实现反革命的复辟；作为社会主义时期主要矛盾的无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，在某些范围内表现为激烈的、你死我活的敌我矛盾，而在大多数情况下表现为人民内部的矛盾。
    在这种错综复杂的阶级斗争的新形势面前，有许多人在思想上是模糊不清的。有些人不承认社会主义社会还有矛盾，因而使他们在社会矛盾面前缩手缩脚，处于被动地位；有些人认为已经没有反革命了，没有阶级斗争了，天下太平了，这就往往使他们不分敌我，认敌为我；有些人不敢公开承认我国人民内部还存在着矛盾，不懂得正是这些矛盾推动着我们的社会向前发展，这就使他们在遇到某些人民内部矛盾表面化的时候惊慌失措，以致把人民内部矛盾当作敌我矛盾。在这种情况下，怎样划分敌我和人民内部两类矛盾的界线，怎样正确处理人民内部的矛盾，就成为摆在全党和全国人民面前的一个重大的问题。
    当时，在国际共产主义运动中，出现了一股逆流。一九五六年二月，在臭名远扬的苏共第二十次代表大会上，叛徒赫鲁晓夫大反斯大林，提出了一条和平共处、和平过渡、和平竞赛的修正主义的路线，从根本上否定了马克思列宁主义关于阶级和阶级斗争、无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。这就使苏共领导在苏联复辟资本主义的道路上，走上了决定性的第一步。由于苏共领导的背叛，由于帝国主义和各国反动派的煽动，在世界各地出现了一股反共反人民的反革命逆流。一九五六年十月匈牙利的反革命叛乱，就是一个突出的事件。这就在国际共产主义运动的队伍中，引起了极大的思想混乱，修正主义思潮从此也大为泛滥起来。
    国内外尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，提出了一系列关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的根本问题，需要给予回答。毛主席就是在这种形势下发表了这部伟大著作，正确地回答和解决了这些根本问题。
    伟大意义
    毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，是一部伟大的、天才的马克思列宁主义著作。毛主席在这部著作中，不但对我国无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的基本经验作了科学的总结，也对伟大十月社会主义革命以来国际无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的基本经验作了科学的总结，第一次全面地、深刻地分析了社会主义社会的矛盾，社会主义社会的阶级和阶级斗争，提出了正确区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾的光辉论断，创造性地继承和发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。毛主席的这部伟大著作，是对马克思列宁主义理论的伟大贡献，它的发表，在我国革命发展史上，在国际共产主义运动发展史上，具有划时代的伟大意义。
    毛主席在这部伟大著作中，坚持和发展了马克思列宁主义的彻底革命精神，为我们党在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期的路线、方针、政策奠定了理论基础。这部著作的光辉思想，是指导我们胜利地开展阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验这三大革命运动的伟大纲领，是我们反对现代修正主义和防止资本主义复辟的强大思想武器，是我们胜利地进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的最高指示，是我们分清敌我、明辨是非的唯一标准。同时，这部著作也澄清了国际共产主义运动中长期以来存在的一些糊涂观念，有力地粉碎了帝国主义和无产阶级的叛徒们对社会主义制度的攻击，成为团结一切革命人民，反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义，推进国际共产主义运动的纲领性文献。
    毛主席的这部著作和《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》，是我国和各国革命思想运动、文艺运动的历史经验的最新的总结，是马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论的新发展，是兴无灭资、横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的强大的思想武器。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，认真地学习这部著作，具有极其重大的现实指导意义。
    内容大意
    毛主席在这部著作中讲了十二个问题。
    一、两类不同性质的矛盾。在我国有着两类不同性质的社会矛盾，即：敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。一切赞成、拥护和参加社会主义建设事业的阶级、阶层和社会集团，都属于人民的范围；一切反抗社会主义革命和敌视、破坏社会主义建设的社会势力和社会集团，都是人民的敌人。矛盾的性质不同，解决矛盾的方法也不同。用专政的方法解决敌我之间的矛盾。用民主的方法解决人民内部的矛盾。
    对立统一规律是宇宙的根本规律。这个规律，不论在自然界、人类社会和人们的思想中，都是普遍存在的。社会主义社会还有矛盾，基本的矛盾仍然是生产关系和生产力之间的矛盾，上层建筑和经济基础之间的矛盾。但是它和旧社会的矛盾，具有根本不同的性质和情况。在我国，仍然存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争。在这个时候，提出正确划分和处理两类矛盾是十分必要的。
    二、肃反问题。肃清反革命分子的问题是敌我矛盾的斗争问题。相当彻底地肃清了反革命，是我们国家巩固的重要原因之一。我们的肃反工作，成绩是主要的。肃反工作的方针是：“有反必肃，有错必纠”。我们在肃反工作中的路线是群众肃反的路线。没有肃清的暗藏的反革命分子是不会死心的，美帝国主义者和蒋介石集团经常还在派遣特务到我们这里来进行破坏活动，在我国还可能出现一些新的反革命分子。我们决不能丧失警惕。
    三、农业合作化问题。我国有五亿多农业人口，农民的情况如何，对于我国经济的发展和政权的巩固，关系极大。合作社建立以后，还必须经过许多的斗争，才能逐步巩固起来。必须经常注意处理生产问题和分配问题上的各种矛盾。正确处理国家、集体、个人三者的关系。
    四、工商业者问题。私营工商业改变为公私合营企业，工人阶级和资产阶级之间的矛盾还没有完全解决。资产阶级仍然存在着两面性。在建设社会主义过程中，人人需要改造，但是剥削者的改造和劳动者的改造是两种不同性质的改造。
    五、知识分子问题。凡是真正愿意为社会主义事业服务的知识分子，都应当给予信任，团结教育他们，发挥他们的才能。世界观的转变是一个根本的转变。知识分子必须继续改造自己，抛弃资产阶级的世界观，树立无产阶级的世界观。没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。在知识分子和青年学生中需要加强思想政治工作。我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。在青年中要进行勤俭建国的教育。
    六、少数民族问题。汉族和少数民族的关系一定要搞好。无论是大汉族主义或者地方民族主义，都不利于各族人民的团结，这是应当克服的一种人民内部的矛盾。
    七、统筹兼顾、适当安排。我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发。要调动一切积极因素，团结一切可能团结的人，并且尽可能地将消极因素转变为积极因素，为建设社会主义社会这个伟大的事业服务。
    八、关于百花齐放、百家争鸣、长期共存、互相监督。百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，是促进艺术发展和科学进步的方针，是促进我国的社会主义文化繁荣的方针。在我国，阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面谁胜谁负的斗争，需要相当长的时间才能解决。马克思主义是在斗争中发展起来的。资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想总要顽强地反映出来。有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争。修正主义是一种资产阶级思潮，它比教条主义有更大的危险性，它是资产阶级复辟资本主义的最好助手。识别香花和毒草有六条政治标准，其中最重要的是社会主义道路和党的领导。各民主党派都要注意思想改造，争取和共产党一道长期共存、互相监督，以适应新社会的需要。
    九、关于少数人闹事问题。我们不赞成闹事，闹事不利于社会主义事业的发展。必须坚决地克服官僚主义，加强思想政治教育，恰当地处理各种矛盾。如果闹了事，就应当利用闹事作为改善工作、教育干部和群众的一种特殊手段。对于少数行凶犯法的人，必须给予必要的法律的制裁。
    十、坏事能否变成好事？我们必须学会全面地看问题。在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果。矛盾着的对立的双方互相斗争的结果，无不在一定条件下互相转化。我们对待帝国主义发动战争，同对待一切“乱子”的态度一样，第一条，反对；第二条，不怕。十一、关于节约。我国六亿人口都要实行增产节约，反对铺张浪费。这不但在经济上有重大意义，在政治上也有重大意义。要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。
    十二、中国工业化的道路。我国是一个大农业国，发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举。没有农业就没有轻工业。农业和轻工业发展了，重工业有了市场和资金，就会更快地发展起来。社会主义社会经济发展的客观规律和我们主观认识之间的矛盾，需要在实践中去解决。
    要着重领会的问题
    在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，学习毛主席的这部伟大著作，要着重领会以下几个问题：
    一、无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态领域里的阶级斗争，在一个相当长的时间里，还是一场极其复杂、极其尖锐的你死我活的斗争。
    毛主席说：“在我国，虽然社会主义改造，在所有制方面说来，已经基本完成，革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争已经基本结束，但是，被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”要彻底解决这个问题，需要一百年到几百年的时间，需要经过极其复杂、极其尖锐的阶级搏斗。无产阶级不坚持对资产阶级的阶级斗争，不坚决把社会主义革命进行到底，我们的党和国家就要变颜色，资本主义就要在中国复辟，世界革命的胜利就要大大推迟。
    意识形态领域里的阶级斗争，是一条极为重要的战线。革命者和反革命者都重视意识形态的作用。我们要发展无产阶级的意识形态，来推动社会的前进。国内外阶级敌人要阴谋搞反革命复辟，也都首先搞意识形态，搞上层建筑，搞理论、学术、文艺等等精神方面的东西，为他们的反革命复辟制造舆论。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中揭露出来的大小“三家村”，就是拚命地抓意识形态，为他们复辟资本主义作舆论准备。我们千万不能轻视意识形态领域里的阶级斗争。
    无产阶级同资产阶级在意识形态领域里谁战胜谁的斗争，是长期的。因为资产阶级及其知识分子的世界观的改造是长期的。产生这种世界观的经济基础已经不存在了，但是反映旧制度并为旧制度服务的反动的世界观，还会长期地存在。剥削阶级统治了劳动人民几千年，他们反动的思想文化，在社会上不能不有广泛的影响。小资产阶级的自发资本主义倾向和习惯势力，又是剥削阶级反动的思想文化得以存在并散布其影响的土壤。同时，国际上帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，经常不断地通过各种渠道，采取各种方式，向我们施放资产阶级的思想毒素，妄图在我国实现资本主义的“和平演变”。要彻底战胜资产阶级的思想，彻底肃清资产阶级思想文化的影响，不能不是一场长期的、严重的阶级斗争。对于这场斗争的长期性认识不足，我们就要犯绝大的错误。
    意识形态领域里的阶级斗争，是极其复杂的。这种斗争既表现为敌我矛盾，也表现为人民内部矛盾，这两类不同性质的矛盾往往交织在一起。在我国存在着强大的无产阶级专政，全国人民无限热爱毛主席，毛泽东思想已经深入人心的情况下，反革命分子反党反社会主义的一个新的特点，就是打着“红旗”反红旗，披着马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的外衣，反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。社会上的阶级斗争，必然会反映到我们党内来。国内的阶级斗争也总是同国际上的阶级斗争互相联系着。这就要求我们必须提高革命警惕，善于分析各种情况，及时识破反革命分子的阴谋，正确地区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾。
    意识形态领域里兴无灭资的斗争，有时也是很激烈的。地主资产阶级虽然被推翻了，但是他们人还在，心不死。他们力图据守思想领域这个最后的阵地，把复辟的希望寄托在意识形态领域的斗争上。你不斗它，它要斗你；你不打倒它，它要打倒你。这是一场复辟和反复辟的你死我活的斗争。无产阶级只有彻底粉碎资产阶级在意识形态领域里的一切挑战和进攻，才能取得最后胜利。
    当前的无产阶级文化大革命，就是一场极其复杂、极其尖锐、极其深刻的意识形态领域里的阶级斗争。这场斗争，是在党中央和毛主席领导下，为了逐步解决意识形态领域里社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题，把社会主义革命进行到底。我军是毛主席亲手缔造的党的最驯服的工具，是无产阶级专政的主要支柱。我们每个干部战士，都要积极投入到这场伟大的斗争中去，和全国革命人民一起高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判反党黑帮的罪行，粉碎它们在意识形态领域里搞资本主义复辟的反革命阴谋，彻底批判资产阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，创造无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中经受考验，得到锻炼和提高。
    二、正确地区分两类不同性质的矛盾，划清敌我界线。
    正确地区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，划清敌我界线，是正确地处理两类不同性质的矛盾的前提。
    毛主席指出：人民和敌人的概念，在不同的国家和各个国家的不同的历史时期，有着不同的内容。在我国现阶段，“在建设社会主义的时期，一切赞成、拥护和参加社会主义建设事业的阶级、阶层和社会集团，都属于人民的范围；一切反抗社会主义革命和敌视、破坏社会主义建设的社会势力和社会集团，都是人民的敌人。”敌我矛盾是对抗性的矛盾，是敌对阶级之间的根本利害的冲突。“人民内部的矛盾，在劳动人民之间说来，是非对抗性的；在被剥削阶级和剥削阶级之间说来，除了对抗性的一面以外，还有非对抗性的一面。”“一般说来，人民内部的矛盾，是在人民利益根本一致的基础上的矛盾。”毛主席的这些指示，是我们分清敌我，正确区分两类矛盾的根本依据。
    我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，是在我们党中央和毛主席的正确领导下进行的。伟大的毛泽东思想，是我们党的灵魂，是我们进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的指针，是我们反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的强大的思想武器。一切革命的敌人要阴谋复辟，要搞反革命政变，都把攻击的矛头指向毛泽东思想。因此，人民和敌人的分界线，集中到一点，就是看他拥护还是反对毛泽东思想。
    在当前无产阶级文化大革命中揭露出来的一切牛鬼蛇神，他们就是刻骨地仇恨和攻击毛泽东思想，妄图推翻党的领导，取消社会主义制度，以达到复辟资本主义的目的。所以他们同我们之间的矛盾，是敌我矛盾，是不可调和的你死我活的斗争。这次无产阶级文化大革命的矛头，就是指向这一小撮反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级代表人物。至于一般的资产阶级知识分子，只要他们不是反共反人民的，愿意在我们党的领导下，用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，批判和克服自己的资产阶级思想，跟全国人民一道走社会主义道路，那么，他们同我们之间的矛盾，还是属于人民内部矛盾。
    毛主席在这篇伟大的著作中，还特别提醒我们，社会主义时期的阶级斗争极为复杂，敌我矛盾同人民内部矛盾往往交织在一起，很容易混淆，因此需要特别注意划清敌我界线。混进党里、政府里、军队里和文化界里，窃踞重要职务的资产阶级代表人物，他们打着“红旗”反红旗，披着马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的外衣，反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。那些暗藏的反革命分子，也会以“革命”的面目出现，乘机捣乱，破坏我们的革命事业。因此，在这种错综复杂的阶级斗争中，能否正确划分两类矛盾的界线，准确地把各种伪装的敌人揪出来，就成为能否正确地处理两类矛盾的关键。
    在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，怎样才能正确区分两类矛盾，识破伪装的敌人呢？最根本的问题是只有掌握和运用毛泽东思想这个政治上的显微镜和望远镜，才能透过现象，看清本质，拨开迷雾，洞察一切，使各种各样的牛鬼蛇神无处藏身。同时，还必须根据毛主席历来的指示，信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。我们以毛泽东思想为武器，又紧紧依靠用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大群众，这样，就能够在复杂的阶级斗争中，正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾，划清敌我界线，就能够把一切牛鬼蛇神暴露在光天化日之下。
    三、根据矛盾的不同性质，采取不同的方法，正确处理敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。
    毛主席教导我们：“敌我之间和人民内部这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同。”对于敌我矛盾必须采取专政的方法解决，就是要压迫阶级敌人，剥夺他们的发言权，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。不这样，革命就要失败，人民就要遭殃，国家就要灭亡。
    人民内部矛盾，必须采取民主的方法，讨论的方法，批评的方法，说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。毛主席总结了我党历史上正确处理人民内部矛盾的经验，概括为一个公式：团结——批评——团结。就是从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争使矛盾得到解决，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结。这是我们正确处理人民内部矛盾一贯的坚定不移的政策。当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命的斗争矛头，是集中力量打击那些只占全人口百分之几的一小撮死心塌地的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命分子。对绝大多数人，我们过去是、现在是、将来也仍然是采取团结——批评——团结的政策。
    正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，必须坚持党的领导。我国人民的一切事业，一切斗争，都是在我们党的正确领导下取得胜利的。无产阶级文化大革命，也只有在党的领导下才能取得胜利。我们的党是光荣、伟大、正确的党。我们的党，有伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为全党团结和革命的思想基础，有以毛主席为核心的党中央的坚强领导。在党中央和毛主席的领导下，我们党的各级组织，我们的党员，我们党的干部，大多数是好的，是忠于无产阶级，忠于共产主义事业，忠于马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的。反党反社会主义的分子只是一小撮，有的党员虽然一时受了混进党内的阶级敌人的蒙蔽，但是在这些阶级敌人被揭露以后，他们立即行动起来，投入战斗。有的党员虽有不同程度的缺点和错误，但是，他们在党和群众的帮助、教育和监督下，经过批评和自我批评，许多人是可以改正过来的。
    有组织、有领导的行动，才是最有效的革命行动。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要在党的正确领导下，更严密地组织起来，更紧密地团结起来，提高阶级嗅觉，提高革命警惕，防止敌人钻空子。我们要密切注视阶级敌人的一举一动，及时识破他们的一切阴谋诡计，决不能让他们混水摸鱼，捞到便宜。
    坚持党的领导，就是要坚决按照党的政策办事。党的路线、方针、政策是以毛泽东思想为指针制订的。党的政策是我们克敌制胜的法宝。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要始终如一地贯彻执行党的政策，讲究斗争方法和斗争策略。只有这样，斗争才能在党中央和毛主席确定的轨道上胜利前进，才能正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，促使矛盾向着有利于我们的方向转化，把坏事变为好事。
    在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，要正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，必须遵照毛主席的教导，放手发动群众，把政策交给群众，坚定地依靠无产阶级左派和广大革命群众，去分清敌我，明辨是非，才能经过斗争团结占全人口百分之九十五以上的人民群众，彻底孤立和战胜一小撮反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的阶级敌人，才能在同阶级敌人作斗争的同时，促进广大群众的思想革命化。
    四、贯彻执行党的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，用无产阶级的政治标准鉴别香花和毒草，彻底批判一切反党反社会主义的反革命言行。
    毛主席说，百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，“是在承认社会主义社会仍然存在着各种矛盾的基础上提出来的，是在国家需要迅速发展经济和文化的迫切要求上提出来的。百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，是促进艺术发展和科学进步的方针，是促进我国的社会主义文化繁荣的方针。”这个口号的提出，是从无产阶级立场出发的，是从巩固社会主义制度、巩固无产阶级专政出发的，是从发展社会主义的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，批判和消灭资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯出发的。所以，百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，是无产阶级坚定的革命的阶级政策，而绝不是资产阶级的“自由化”。
    在思想文化领域里，我们对于人民内部的不同意见，允许人们自由的讨论，自由的争辩，通过自由的讨论和争辩，分清是非。但是，对于那些反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的毒草，绝不能给它们这种自由，绝不能给它们合法存在的权利。毛主席说：“有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争。”一小撮资产阶级代表人物，他们恶意歪曲百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，抹煞它的阶级内容。他们拿毒草当香花，并且借口“放”，让资产阶级的“专家”、“学者”、“权威”大肆放毒，让一切牛鬼蛇神出笼，不允许无产阶级反击。这是一个大阴谋。
    毛主席根据无产阶级的利益，提出了辨别香花和毒草的六条政治标准：“（一）有利于团结全国各族人民，而不是分裂人民；（二）有利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设，而不是不利于社会主义改造和社会主义建设；（三）有利于巩固人民民主专政，而不是破坏或者削弱这个专政；（四）有利于巩固民主集中制，而不是破坏或者削弱这个制度；（五）有利于巩固共产党的领导，而不是摆脱或者削弱这种领导；（六）有利于社会主义的国际团结和全世界爱好和平人民的国际团结，而不是有损于这些团结。这六条标准中，最重要的是社会主义道路和党的领导两条。”伟大的毛泽东思想是我们党的灵魂，是我们走社会主义道路的指路明灯。因此，区分香花还是毒草的根本界限，就是看它是拥护毛泽东思想，还是反对毛泽东思想。
    钻进党内的一小撮资产阶级代表人物，把反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的政治问题，说成是“纯学术”问题，这纯粹是骗人的鬼话。在有阶级斗争的社会里，任何一种学术，不是为这个阶级服务，就是为那个阶级服务。他们打着“纯学术”问题的幌子，妄图掩护牛鬼蛇神过关，扭转无产阶级文化大革命的政治方向。这完全是痴心妄想。
    毛主席提出的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，体现了我们党的群众路线和无产阶级的阶级路线。只有广大工农兵群众，才是百花齐放、百家争鸣的主体。广大工农兵成为当前我国无产阶级文化大革命的主力军，从资产阶级的“权威”手里夺回了文化的统治大权，这是一件具有划时代意义的事情。
    五、愿意革命的知识分子和一切革命者都必须改造世界观，实现思想革命化。文化教育部门和其他一切部门，必须突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，改造一切。
    毛主席说：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”毛主席在这里提出了一个极为重要的问题，这就是，一切革命者必须用无产阶级的思想来统帅自己的思想和行动，来改造自己的世界观；文化教育部门和其他一切部门，必须实行无产阶级的政治挂帅。一句话，必须突出政治。
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变，现在多数知识分子还不能说已经完成了这个转变。”解放十几年来，虽然知识分子的改造取得了一定的成绩，除了一小撮极端仇视社会主义事业的反动的资产阶级知识分子以外，大多数知识分子都有了程度不同的进步，但是，世界观的转变是阶级立场和阶级感情的根本改变，没有高度的自觉性，不经过长期艰苦的实践锻炼和思想斗争过程，是不可能真正完成这个转变的。从这次无产阶级文化大革命中暴露出来的问题看，有些知识分子受了黑线的影响，自觉不自觉地跟着它走，为它效劳，正是由于自己的资产阶级世界观没有得到根本改造。因此，愿意革命的知识分子和一切革命者，一定要在这次触及人们灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命中，坚决同一小撮黑帮分子划清界线，彻底批判他们的反革命言行，同时，认真清除自己头脑里的资产阶级思想，加速实现思想革命化，把我们的各项工作做得好上加好。
    在文化教育部门和一切部门中突出无产阶级政治，这是一个根本问题。突出不突出无产阶级政治，搞不搞人的思想革命化，搞不搞阶级斗争，是坚持不坚持社会主义方向的问题，是要不要无产阶级专政的问题，是要不要无产阶级政党的领导的问题，归根到底，就是高举不高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的问题，坚持革命还是不坚持革命的问题。这是关系到社会主义社会是发展前进，还是倒退变质的问题。
    我们的工作有千件万件，但是最最重要的第一件就是突出政治，突出毛泽东思想。那种把业务、技术摆在第一位的观点，实际上是一种资产阶级政治。它要把人们引向资产阶级个人主义的道路上去，把人们引向修正主义的道路上去。
    林彪同志说：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”文化教育部门和一切部门，都必须突出无产阶级政治，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，都必须把毛主席的书当作各项工作的最高指示。毛主席的文艺路线和教育方针必须坚决贯彻，教育制度必须彻底改革。必须切实加强政治思想工作，把毛主席的书当作必修课，用毛泽东思想去改造一切，统帅一切，调动一切积极因素，为社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业奋斗到底。
