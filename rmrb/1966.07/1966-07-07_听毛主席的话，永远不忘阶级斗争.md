In the old society, my entire family was trampled underfoot by the three great lords as hereditary serfs, unable to live and unable to die. In 1959, the storm of democratic revolution swept through my hometown. At the mass meeting to struggle against the rebel leader and agent of the landlords, Awang Zaxi, I could no longer suppress the anger in my heart. I rushed onto the stage and grabbed him, shouting, "Do you recognize me, Awang Zaxi!" At that moment, I could have eaten him alive to avenge my family's generations of hatred. It was this wolf that killed my father, raped my mother, and stole our family's meager cattle, sheep, and grain. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who liberated me. Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the liberated serfs! That year, everyone elected me as the village agricultural association chairman. In 1964, I became the deputy secretary of the district committee, and last year, everyone elected me as the deputy county magistrate.

The hatred is not personal; it is the hatred of the entire class.

I joined the work with a belly full of vengeful thoughts. The agent of the landlords, Awang Zaxi, had harmed my entire family, and I hated him to the core. However, due to my lack of understanding of the class nature of the landlords at that time, I felt that the former owner, Namu Jie, was not bad. In his household, although I worked hard, the food was at least a bit better. Sometimes, when my family had nothing to eat, I could borrow a little from him. At the beginning of the democratic reform, the agent of the landlords, Namu Jie, tried to win me over by having me take off my ragged clothes and exchange them for a new dress and a nobleman's coat from his wife. Others saw this and said, "You look like a nobleman!" At that time, I felt quite pleased. Later, he also made me a pair of new embroidered shoes. At that time, I mistakenly thought that not all landlords were the same; some were evil-hearted, and some were kind-hearted. When struggling against him, I did not speak out about my grievances. Later, I went with district and village cadres to various villages to lead the masses in struggling against the lords. When I encountered lords or agents of the landlords I knew, I also went on stage to participate in the struggle. During the mass meetings in various villages, I heard some people expose that Lord Namu Jie had the highest usury interest rates, actively supported the rebels by selling seeds to buy horses for them, and in the following spring, there was nothing to sow. Listening to others' sufferings and thinking of my own, I finally understood: he deceived and won me over to prevent me from exposing his crimes. It turned out that there were no good landlords. Others had sufferings, and so did I. The suffering was not just mine; it was the suffering of the entire serf class. My personal vengeance was not enough; I had to avenge the entire serf class. After realizing this, I immediately mobilized the masses to further expose Namu Jie's crimes. With the approval of the county committee, we thoroughly struggled against this two-faced scoundrel.

The revolution has just begun; how can we retreat?

The democratic reform achieved great victories. At that time, I thought: the class enemies have been overthrown, the liberated serfs have taken control, and now we should develop production. My body is so strong; I can go back home to be a farmer. As long as I can manage production well, I won't have to worry about a good life. At this time, the organization assigned me to Lhasa for training. In the training class, I spoke about the sufferings of the old society. Through remembrance of bitterness and sweetness, and discussions with other cadres about class struggles in various places, my thoughts began to stir. Especially after we studied Chairman Mao's instructions on class and class struggle, my mind became clearer. Chairman Mao said: After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist. They will inevitably struggle to the death with us, and we must not underestimate these enemies. These words made me think deeply. I realized that in our district and villages, the class enemies with guns had been overthrown, but they were not subdued! They were still trying to win over cadres and backward masses, and their arrogance had not been completely crushed. This was not a thorough revolution, was it? At that time, the leading comrades told me: Chairman Mao told us that after the victory of the democratic revolution, we have only completed the first step of the long march of ten thousand li. In the future, we will carry out socialist revolution, and the struggle between socialism and capitalism will be a long-term task. The situation in our district is exactly like this. After the democratic reform, there appeared a polarization between the rich and the poor. The poor farmer Dobuje from Bailang Village sold all the things he had received a year after the democratic reform. He ate the unripe crops and burned grass for fuel, but the livestock had nothing to eat. Previously, I thought this was due to his laziness, but now I realized that this was the result of polarization! Clearly, the revolution had just begun; how could I think of retreating? The more I thought about it, the more painful it became. It was Chairman Mao who educated me. I must dedicate my life to the revolution for the complete liberation of the laboring people and study Chairman Mao's works for life. In December 1961, I proudly joined the Communist Party of China. I swore: "I will fight to the end for the complete liberation of the Chinese people and all the people of the world!"

Consider the benefits to the poor farmers in everything.

In his work "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," Chairman Mao said: "Without the poor peasants, there is no revolution. If you deny them, you deny the revolution. If you attack them, you attack the revolution." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, I firmly implement the party's class line in all my work. I first consider whether something is beneficial to the poor farmers, and if it is, I will resolutely carry it out.

In 1962, when I went to work in Bailang Village, I saw that there were many problems with the mutual aid teams. Some teams were organized on the surface, but in reality, many people were still working individually. What was the problem? At that time, I was not clear. Later, I studied some of Chairman Mao's articles on mutual aid and cooperation. In 1955, Chairman Mao said: The spontaneous capitalist tendencies in the countryside are developing day by day. Many well-off middle peasants want to become rich peasants, and some poor peasants are being exploited. This is polarization. I had a clear understanding. I went deep into the fourth mutual aid team to find out the problem. This team had ten households, nine of which were poor farmers, and one was a middle peasant. The nine poor farmers had a total of 114 mu of land (one mu is approximately 0.165 acres), with an average yield of 2 mu per mu (each mu yields 28 jin, approximately 14 kilograms). However, the middle peasant had 98 mu of land, with an average yield of 6 mu. I had a discussion with a few poor farmers and found that a considerable number of people thought: fighting against the lords relied on poor farmers, but developing production relied on middle peasants because middle peasants had skills, tools, and experience. Therefore, whether it was a meeting or arranging farm work, it was actually this middle peasant who called the shots. However, this middle peasant often used small favors to win over some poor farmers to work for him. But when the seedlings in his field had already sprouted, some poor farmers' fields had not even been sown! After understanding the situation, I thought: if we continue like this, it will be like a horse race, with those who have strength running forward. What kind of mutual aid is this? If we continue like this, won't the old society unknowingly return? When I worked with them, I told them about the party's reliance on poor farmers' class line and analyzed the pros and cons of continuing this way. Everyone became aware. They said, "This is exploitation of us!" Through further discussions, everyone clearly understood that this was a concrete manifestation of the struggle between the two lines. They realized that poor farmers must take the lead in the team to manage the mutual aid team well. They said: With the party's leadership, we have been liberated; with the party's leadership, we will definitely be able to develop production well. I also found the middle peasant and criticized his mistakes, pointing out that his past actions were exploitative behavior towards poor farmers. I said, in the old society, you also suffered from the exploitation of the three great lords. You also had endless corvee labor, and you also knew how bitter it was to be oppressed. Today, the party leads us to be liberated, so why do you also take the road of exploiting others? After our repeated criticisms, the middle peasant admitted his mistakes. The leadership of the mutual aid team was in the hands of the poor farmers, and production changed. After two years of hard work and state support, this team's 212 mu of land had an average yield of 6 mu and 10 jin in 1964. The nine poor farmers sold surplus grain to the state for the first time.

I have initially learned to handle two types of contradictions.

Chairman Mao often teaches us: In the socialist period, class struggle is long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense. However, where is the long-term, tortuous, and intense struggle? I did not understand this deeply. When I worked in Kebu Village, something like this happened: the village cadres gave me a petition with many opinions about Deputy Village Head Quzhen. I was puzzled: the work in this village had been lagging behind in the past, but why did the masses have so many opinions about Quzhen? I rushed to the village and found that there was not a single plow for plowing the land, while other villages had already started plowing. I did not ask the reason but first found a poor farmer's home to stay. A few days later, I heard the masses say that Quzhen was very close to the agent of the landlords, and everyone opposed her being the deputy village head. I found a few poor farmers to ask for their opinions on Quzhen and to hear their views. The poor farmer Sangmu Dan said, "Quzhen has problems, but whether she is colluding with the agent of the landlords or the agent of the landlords is colluding with her, I am not sure." Some people said that someone wanted to nominate the former shaman Lozhu to be the village head. What was really going on? The problem was like a tangled mess of wool with no head or tail. At that time, I was a bit anxious, but I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Without investigation, there is no right to speak," "All practical workers must go down to investigate." I felt that I had a way out. I thought: this might be the work of the class enemy. But why were the masses so fiercely opposed to Quzhen? I thought for a long time. Finally, I thought: it is still better to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and mobilize the masses. If it is mainly a contradiction among the people, this incident will be an education for the cadres; if there are two types of contradictions, we should first solve the contradictions among the people and then mobilize the broad masses to rely on the masses, isolate the enemy, and strike the enemy. After reporting to the higher authorities, I decided to do this.

I visited a few basic households and also listened to the opinions of other village cadres. I decided to talk to Quzhen again. She was hesitant and a bit afraid at first. I said, "Quzhen, you and I were both slaves of the same lord in the past. The party saved us from the fire pit and made us cadres. We cannot always hide in the mountains. You were elected by the masses, so why do you always collude with the agent of the landlords?" This reminded her of the old society. That night, we talked for a long time. Finally, she said painfully, "Sister, I have made mistakes. I was tempted by convenience and borrowed clothes from the agent of the landlords to wear. The agent of the landlords also made wine for me. I did not listen to the party and Chairman Mao. My class stance has problems." Finally, Quzhen burst into tears. I further asked her how she borrowed clothes from the agent of the landlords. She said, "The agent of the landlords came to my door to lend them to me." When I told her that the agent of the landlords told the masses that she had confiscated his clothes to wear herself, Quzhen said it was not the case at all. The enemy's heart is so evil! The truth came to light, and I was so angry. At that time, I really wanted to directly find the agent of the landlords and scold him. But then I thought, Chairman Mao teaches us: when the masses are not yet aware, if we attack, that is adventurism. It is better to first clarify the masses' thoughts and solve the contradictions among the people.

Later, we convened a meeting of village cadres. At the meeting, Quzhen frankly checked her problems and first conducted a class education for the village cadres. The village cadre Zaxi Jiebu, who had the most opinions about Quzhen, was shocked after hearing Quzhen's self-examination and said, "Quzhen has shortcomings, but I did not clarify the right and wrong and the enemy relationship in the past and followed everyone else. I was also wrong." More village cadres said: We were deceived by the class enemy. It was the agent of the landlords who sowed discord among the cadres and between the village committee and the masses. Finally, I said: The class enemy used the shortcomings and mistakes of the cadres to create chaos. The problem among the cadres was solved, and we then discussed how to further connect and mobilize the masses. Everyone decided to go to connect with the masses in groups and explain the true situation. Quzhen herself also went to the mutual aid team where she had the most opinions to check her problems, and the masses criticized her. After this work, many masses said: Quzhen can admit her mistakes and is determined to correct them, which is good; we were deceived by the agent, and we must struggle against him! Some masses further exposed the agent of the landlords' crimes of attempting to restore the old society. Everyone was very excited. Some said, "I always thought the agent had changed, but I didn't expect him to still be a wolf in sheep's clothing!" The masses clarified the right and wrong, and the conditions for holding a struggle meeting were ripe. After reporting to the county committee for approval, I went with the village cadres to directly find the agent of the landlords, pointing out his criminal activities, and ordered him to honestly confess to the masses. At the struggle meeting, many poor farmers eagerly spoke, and those who previously opposed Quzhen this time pointed at the agent of the landlords' nose and angrily said, "In the old society, you oppressed us for many years. Today, you still don't open your eyes to see where the sun rises from. You still want to restore the old society? You are blind! We only now see clearly that the wolf will never become a sheep." In the masses' angry denunciation, the agent of the landlords admitted his crimes.

Through this struggle against the enemy, I initially learned to use Mao Zedong Thought to handle two types of contradictions, and also made the masses see their own strength and increased their confidence in liberating themselves.

Use class analysis to solve problems in the masses' thoughts and production.

In leading production, I also use the class analysis perspective to solve specific problems in the masses' thoughts and production. When I went to Chongdui Village in Langkang Village for universal suffrage, I learned that 62 poor farmer households had many difficulties in production and life. Spring plowing was about to begin, and some poor households in the village still followed the old habit of not applying fertilizer. I was also worried about this. At this time, I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: When you encounter a problem you cannot solve, go to the masses and walk around. After investigating and researching, the solution will come out. I stayed in the home of the poorest farmer in the village, Baimayangjin. When she knew that I was also a liberated serf, she told me: The party calls on us to accumulate fertilizer, not that our village lacks fertilizer. Just take the toilet as an example; many families have it, but no one wants to clean it. Later, I learned from other poor farmers that in the village of several dozen households, only two people specialized in cleaning toilets for others. Everyone laughed at these two people as the most "lowly" people. Everyone thought that cleaning toilets was an inauspicious thing, and some people who cleaned it also burned pine branches to dispel the "evil air." The problem was found, and I chose the village's labor-poor, impoverished, and fertilizer-rich families, Benda and Pengduo, as examples to help them dig toilets and use them to promote the rest. That day, I crawled into the toilet and shoveled out the filth with my feet stepping on it, shoveling for more than two hours. At this time, many people came to watch, and they commented, "The cadres are cleaning toilets, which is unheard of!" I did not say anything. That night, I went to these few households to talk. They said that cleaning toilets was inauspicious. I said, in the old society, cleaning toilets for others was done by us poor people. Considering cleaning toilets as inauspicious was because the landlords disliked dirt and feared the smell, so they called the people who cleaned toilets the most "lowly" people. Today, we accumulate fertilizer for our own fields, produce more grain, improve our lives, and this is glorious. What is "lowly" about it? Why do we still follow the old society's ways? After education, combined with the actual actions of the two households, the entire village was influenced, breaking the habit of not digging toilets and not applying fertilizer. Every household dug toilets, and the vast majority of people applied fertilizer to the land.

A series of facts made me further realize: Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will produce tremendous material force! In the future, I will better study and apply Chairman Mao's works and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

    听毛主席的话，永远不忘阶级斗争
    西藏自治区林周县副县长　茨登卓玛
    在旧社会，我们全家是被三大领主踩在脚底下的世袭农奴，活不成也死不了。一九五九年，民主革命的风暴刮到了我的家乡。在斗争叛匪头目、农奴主代理人阿旺扎西的群众大会上，我再也按不住心里的怒火，跑上台去，揪住他说：“你还认识我吗，阿旺扎西！”当时就是一口把他吃了，也解不了我家世代的仇恨。就是这只吃人的狼，害死了我的阿爸，强奸了我的阿妈，抢走了我家仅有的牛羊和粮食。是党和毛主席解放了我，毛主席是我们翻身农奴心中的红太阳！这年，大家选我当了乡农会主任，一九六四年担任区委副书记，去年大家又选我当了副县长。
    仇，不是个人的，是整个阶级的
    我是带着一肚子报仇的思想参加工作的。农奴主代理人阿旺扎西害了我们全家，我恨透了他。可是由于我当时对农奴主的阶级本质认识不清，对原来的主人南木杰却觉得不错。我在他家，虽说活累一点，但吃的总算稍好点，有时我家没吃的，向他借还能借一点。在民主改革开始时，农奴主代理人南木杰，为了拉拢我，叫我把破衣服脱下来，把他老婆的一件新衣服和一件贵族的外套给我换上了。别人看到说：“你象个贵族了！”当时我心里还挺美。以后他又给我做了双新花鞋。这时我错误地认为，农奴主不都一样，有坏心的，也有好心的。斗争他的时候，我没有诉苦。后来我跟区乡干部一起，到各乡去以苦引苦，发动群众，斗争领主，碰上我认识的领主或农奴主代理人，我也上台参加斗争。在各乡群众诉苦的时候，我听到一些人揭发领主南木杰放高利贷利息比谁都高，他积极支援叛匪，把种子卖了换马给叛匪，第二年春天都种不上地。听了别人的苦，联想到我自己，这时我才明白了：他对我是欺骗和拉拢，是为了叫我不揭发他的罪恶。原来农奴主没有一个好的。别人有苦，我也有苦，受苦的不是我一个人，是整个农奴阶级。我个人报了仇不行，还要为整个农奴阶级报仇。明白以后，我立即发动群众，进一步揭发了南木杰的罪恶，经县委批准，把这个两面三刀的家伙狠狠地斗了一顿。
    革命刚刚开始，怎么能后退
    民主改革取得了伟大胜利。我当时想：阶级敌人被斗倒了，翻身农奴掌握了印把子，以后该发展生产了。我身体这么好，回家当个农民，只要把生产搞好，不愁没好日子过。这时候，组织上把我调到拉萨去学习。在训练班里，我诉了旧社会的苦，通过忆苦思甜，和其他干部摆各地阶级斗争的事实，使我思想上又动了起来。特别是我们学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的指示以后，我的心里更亮了。毛主席说：在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。这段话，我越想越觉得毛主席是对着我的思想说的。联想起我们区乡，带枪的阶级敌人是被打倒了，但是他们并没有老实呀！他们还在拉拢干部和后进群众，他们的威风并没有被彻底打掉。这不是革命还不彻底吗？当时领导同志向我讲：毛主席告诉我们，民主革命胜利后，只是万里长征走完了第一步，将来还要搞社会主义革命，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，还是长期的任务。我们区里的情况正是这样。民主改革后，又出现了穷的穷、富的富的两极分化。白朗乡的贫苦农民多布杰，民主改革后一年就把分的东西卖光了，庄稼没有全熟，就把熟穗吃光了，草当柴烧，牲口却没吃的。过去还认为那是他懒的缘故，这回才明白，这就是两极分化的结果啊！明明是革命刚刚开始，我怎么就想后退呢？越想越难过。又是毛主席教育了我，我一定要为劳动人民的彻底解放干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席的书。一九六一年十二月我光荣地参加了中国共产党，我宣誓说：“要为中国人民和全世界人民的彻底解放干到底！”
    遇事先想想对贫苦农民有没有好处
    毛主席在《湖南农民运动考察报告》一文中说：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。”按照毛主席的指示，我不论做什么工作，都要坚决地贯彻党的阶级路线，遇事首先想想对贫苦农民有没有好处，有好处我就坚决地去做。
    一九六二年我到白朗乡工作的时候，看到互助组的问题不少。有的互助组表面上组织起来，但实际上不少人还是单干。这是个什么问题呢？当时还不清楚，后来我学了毛主席关于互助合作的一些文章。一九五五年，毛主席讲过：农村的资本主义自发势力一天一天地在发展，有许多富裕中农想当富农，一些贫农受剥削，这就是两极分化。我心里有底了，就深入第四互助组，看看到底问题在哪里。这个组一共有十户，其中九户是贫苦农民，一户中等农民。九户贫苦农民共一百一十四克地（一克相当于一亩），平均单产是二克（每克二十八斤），但一户中等农民就有九十八克地，单产都是六克。我找了几户贫苦农民座谈，原来有相当一部分人认为：斗争领主靠贫苦农民，发展生产还得靠中等农民，因为中等农民有技术、有工具、有经验。所以开会也好，安排农活也好，实际上是这户中等农民说了算数。而这户中等农民也常用一些小恩小惠拉拢一些贫苦农民给他干活。可是当他地里的小苗已经出土的时候，一些贫苦农民的地还没种上呢！情况摸清了以后我就想：这样下去真跟赛马一样，谁有劲谁就往前跑，这叫什么互助呢？这么发展下去，旧社会不是不知不觉地又回来了吗？我跟他们一起劳动的时候，向他们讲了党依靠贫苦农民的阶级路线，分析了这么干下去的利害关系，大家觉悟了。他们说：“这是剥削我们！”又通过进一步座谈，使大家明确认识了这就是两条道路斗争的具体反映，懂得了贫苦农民必须掌握组内的领导权才能办好互助组的道理。他们表示：有党的领导，我们翻了身；有党的领导，我们一定能把生产搞好。我又找了这户中等农民，对他的错误进行了批评，指出了他过去的作法是对贫苦农民的剥削行为。我说，旧社会你也受三大领主的剥削，你也有支不完的差役，你也知道受压迫的味道不好受。今天，党领导我们翻了身，你怎么也走上了剥削别人的道路呢？经过我们多次批评，这户中等农民承认了错误。互助组的领导权掌握在贫苦农民手里，生产就变了样。经过两年的辛勤劳动和国家的扶持，这个组二百一十二克地，一九六四年的平均单产达到了六克十升，九户贫苦农民第一次向国家卖了余粮。
    初步学会处理两类不同的矛盾
    毛主席常常教导我们：在社会主义时期，阶级斗争还是长期的、曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。但是长期、曲折、激烈在什么地方，我体会得不深。我在克布乡工作的时候，曾发生过这样一件事：乡干部交给我一份意见书，对副乡长曲珍提了很多意见。我当时很奇怪：这个乡的工作过去是落后一些，但群众为什么对曲珍有这么多意见？我赶到这个乡一看，一副耕地的犁也没有，这时别的乡早就开犁了。我没问原因，先找了一户贫苦农民家住下。几天以后，听到群众说曲珍和农奴主代理人拉扯得很热乎，大家都反对她当副乡长。我找了几户贫苦农民来征求对曲珍有什么意见，请大家谈谈看法。贫苦农民桑木丹说：“曲珍是有问题，但究竟是她拉农奴主代理人还是农奴主代理人拉她，搞不清楚。”有的人说，已经有人要把过去一个跳神的洛珠推举当乡长。这到底是怎么回事？问题象乱羊毛似的没个头绪。我当时心里有些急，但一想到毛主席的教导：“没有调查就没有发言权”，“一切实际工作者必须向下作调查”。我觉得又有了办法。我想：这里很可能是阶级敌人搞的鬼。但是群众为什么这样激烈地反对曲珍呢？我思考了很久。最后我想，还是按毛主席的教导，相信群众，依靠群众，发动群众。如果主要是人民内部矛盾，通过这件事对干部是个教育；如果两类矛盾都有，就先解决人民内部矛盾，再把广大群众动员起来，依靠群众，孤立敌人、打击敌人。我向上级请示以后，就决定这么办。
    我访问了几户基本群众，也听了其他乡干部的意见，决定再找曲珍谈谈。她开始吞吞吐吐，有些害怕。我就说：“曲珍，咱们俩过去是一家领主的奴隶。党把我们从火坑里救了出来，当了干部，我们可不能老往山沟里钻哪。你是群众选出来的，为什么老跟农奴主代理人勾勾搭搭呢？”这么一说，引起了她对旧社会的回忆。这天晚上我们谈了很久，最后她沉痛地说：“阿加（姐姐），我有错误，我贪图便宜，借了农奴主代理人的衣服穿，农奴主代理人给我做过酒。我没听党和毛主席的话，我的阶级立场有问题。”最后曲珍抱头哭了。我进一步追问她怎样向农奴主代理人借衣服穿。她说：“是农奴主代理人找上门来借给我的。”当我告诉她“农奴主代理人对群众说是你没收了他的衣服留作自己穿”的时候，曲珍说完全不是这么回事。敌人的心真毒！真相大白了，把我也气得够呛。当时我真想直接找那个农奴主代理人去训他一顿。可是又一想，毛主席教导我们：当群众还不觉悟的时候，我们要去进攻，那就是冒险主义。还是先把群众思想搞通，先解决人民内部的矛盾。
    后来，我们就召开了乡干部会。会上，曲珍如实地检查了自己的问题，对乡干部先进行了一次阶级教育。乡干部扎西杰布原来对曲珍的意见最多，他听了曲珍的检查以后，吃惊地说：“曲珍是有缺点，我过去没弄清是非和敌我关系，也跟着大家跑，我也不对。”更多的乡干部说：我们上了阶级敌人的当，是农奴主代理人挑拨了干部之间的关系，挑拨了乡委会和群众的关系。最后我说：阶级敌人是利用了干部中的缺点、错误，制造了混乱。干部之间的问题解决了，我们就研究怎样进一步串连发动群众。大家决定，分头去串连群众，说明事实真相。曲珍自己也到对她意见最多的互助组里去检查自己的问题，群众对她进行了批评。经过这步工作之后，很多群众表示：曲珍能认错，决心改正就行；我们上了代理人的当，非斗争他不行！还有一些群众进一步揭发了农奴主代理人妄想复辟的罪行。大家情绪很激动。有的说：“我过去总以为代理人变好了，没想到他还是一只披着羊皮的狼！”群众辨明了是非，开斗争会的条件已经成熟。请示县委批准后，我就和乡干部一起直接找农奴主代理人，指出了他的罪恶活动，命令他老老实实地向群众交代。斗争会上很多贫苦农民争着发言，过去反对曲珍的人，这回指着农奴主代理人的鼻子愤怒地说：“旧社会你欺压了我们多少年，今天你也不睁眼看看，太阳是从哪方出来的，你还想恢复旧社会？你瞎了眼睛！我们今天才看透了狼永远不会变成羊。”在群众愤怒的声讨中，农奴主代理人承认了自己的罪行。
    通过这次对敌斗争，我初步学会了用毛泽东思想处理两类不同性质的矛盾，也使群众看清了自己的力量，增强了群众自己解放自己的信心。
    用阶级观点分析群众思想、生产上的问题
    在领导生产中，我也以阶级分析观点去解决群众思想上、生产上的具体问题。我到冲堆乡拉康村搞普选的时候，了解到六十二户贫苦农民的生产、生活有不少困难。春耕快开始了，村里一些贫苦户还按过去的老习惯，不上肥料。我为这事也很发愁。这时，我想起了毛主席教导的：你碰到解决不了的问题，就到群众中去走一走，调查研究完了，办法也就出来了。我在全村最穷的白玛央金家住下了。当她知道我也是一个翻身农奴的时候，她告诉我说：党号召我们积肥，不是我们村肥少，就拿厕所来说，很多家都有，就是没人愿意掏。以后我又从其他贫苦农民那里了解到：村里几十户人家，只有两人专门给人家掏厕所。对这两个人，大家笑话他们是最“下贱”的人。大家认为掏厕所是件很不吉利的事，有的人掏了也要烧松枝，表示除“瘴气”。问题摸出来了，我就选择了村里劳力少、穷困、肥多的边巴、彭多两家人作为点，先帮他们挖厕所，用点来推动面。那天，我钻到厕所里边，两脚踩在粪便上，一锹一锹地往外掏，足足掏了两个多小时。这时，很多人来看热闹，他们议论说：干部也掏起厕所来了，真是没听说过的事！听着这些议论，我没吭声。晚上，我又到这几户人家去谈。他们说，掏厕所的人不吉祥。我说，旧社会给人家掏厕所，都是咱们穷人。认为掏厕所不吉利，是因为农奴主们嫌脏、怕臭，他们才把掏厕所的人叫作最“下贱”的人。今天，我们积肥往自己地里上，多打粮食，改善生活，这是光荣的，有什么“下贱”呢？咱们为什么还听旧社会那套呢？经过教育，加上那两户的实际行动，影响了全村，打破了不挖厕所不施肥的习惯，家家户户掏了厕所，绝大多数的人，给土地施了肥。
    一系列的事实使我进一步体会到：毛泽东思想一旦被群众所掌握，就会产生巨大的物质力量！我今后要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，照毛主席的指示办事。
