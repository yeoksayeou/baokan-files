One day in June 1964, our class helped the commune weed in the sorghum fields. Everyone worked together with the commune members in the same plot, competing with each other, full of enthusiasm. Liu Yingjun swung his hoe, striking accurately and weeding thoroughly. In the time it takes to smoke a cigarette, he reached the end of the plot and then turned around to help others.

The commune members, seeing his work, praised him, saying, "This young man works with such vigor!" "Great, he looks like he comes from a farming family."

Just as everyone was discussing, the work recorder, Xiao Zhang, noticed that Liu Yingjun's hoe handle had the words of Chairman Mao:
"Learn from Comrade Lei Feng."

On the back, it was also carved with "The revolution will always have successors."

This discovery quickly spread. During the break, everyone gathered around to look at this hoe. Commune member Zhu Fengshan seemed to have a sudden realization and said, "No wonder Liu Yingjun works so happily! It turns out that Chairman Mao's words are carved on the hoe handle."

Zhu Fengshan was right. When Liu Yingjun carved these seven characters, he had told his classmate, Li Quan-sheng, "When I think of Chairman Mao's call, I feel like I have boundless energy!"

　　“想起毛主席的号召……”
　　班长　李尚友
    一九六四年六月的一天，我们班帮助公社在高粱地里铲草。大家和社员在一块地里干活，你追我赶，热气腾腾。刘英俊扬起锄头，下得准，铲得净，一袋烟的功夫，就铲到了地头，转身又去帮助别人。
    社员们看他干的活计，满口称赞说：“这小伙子干活真虎势！”“行，看样子也是庄稼人出身。”
    大家正在议论的时候，记工员小张发现刘英俊的锄杠上刻着毛主席的题词：
      “向雷锋同志学习”。
    在背面还刻上了“革命自有后来人”。
    这个发现，很快就被传开了。休息的时候，大伙儿围上来看这把锄头。社员朱凤山好象恍然大悟地说：“怪不得刘英俊干得这么欢呢！原来这锄杠上刻着毛主席的题词。”
    朱凤山说对了，刘英俊在刻这七个字的时候，就对同班的李全胜同志说过：“想起毛主席的号召，浑身就有使不完的劲！”
