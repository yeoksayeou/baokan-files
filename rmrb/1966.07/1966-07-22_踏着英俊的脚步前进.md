I opened the newspaper reporting the heroic sacrifice of Comrade Liu Yingjun with an unusually excited heart. A familiar face appeared before me, and I could hardly believe that this was my cousin, Yingjun! I read it over and over, deeply moved by his heroic deeds. My younger brother did the right thing; he did everything that a young person in the great era of Mao Zedong should do. Before his death, he said, "Life is short, but as long as one follows the example of Comrades Lei Feng and Wang Jie, devoting oneself to the revolution and the people, a short life can shine with an everlasting light." He said it beautifully, and he did it beautifully.

It was the sunlight and rain of Mao Zedong Thought that made this young sapling grow strong and healthy, and it was the revolutionary crucible that tempered him into such a strong person. His growth path is the common path that every young person in our era should take. He did not disappoint the Party's nurturing and the people's expectations. I will learn from him, finish reading Chairman Mao's books that he did not finish, walk the path he did not complete, and write the diary he did not finish. I will, like him, dedicate everything, even my life, for the people's interests.

My younger brother often wrote to me, sharing his thoughts on studying Chairman Mao's works. He said, "I studied 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' and understood what kind of person I should be. Although I cannot compare to Norman Bethune, I have the resolve to be like him, selfless and dedicated to the cause of liberating all humanity, contributing my blood and strength."

"I studied 'The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains' and learned how to face work and difficulties, gaining strength throughout my body."

He loved those armed with Mao Zedong Thought the most. In 1963, in response to Chairman Mao's great call, the country launched a campaign to learn from Comrade Lei Feng. He was the first to copy Lei Feng's diary for me and send me a photo of Lei Feng. From his letters, I could see that he was deeply influenced by Lei Feng's noble qualities. He said, "We must, like Comrade Lei Feng, dedicate our limited lives to the infinite service of the people, becoming a rust-free screw and an unnamed hero!" Later, he wrote many times, always writing Lei Feng's words on the envelope, encouraging us to learn from each other. In 1965, when another great communist warrior, Wang Jie, appeared, he was the first to write to me, introducing Wang Jie's heroic deeds. He strictly examined himself, saying, "I have not been like Comrade Wang Jie, wholeheartedly for the revolution and the people, sometimes with personal considerations. How can I be a revolutionary warrior? I truly hate myself, and in the future, I will learn from Comrade Wang Jie, fearing neither hardship nor death, completely and thoroughly serving the people." He also said, "The American imperialists are madly invading Vietnam. I wish I could rush to Vietnam and open fire on the American imperialists. I have made all preparations, including sacrifice. As soon as the Party gives the order, I will rush to the front line, dedicating my youth and life to the moment when the world's people need it most." It is clear that he had long been prepared to sacrifice himself bravely.

He was always eager to help others and willing to accept criticism and help from others. He often cut out Mao Zedong's quotations from the newspaper, pasted them on the envelope, and sent them to me, urging me to study hard and firmly root myself in the forest area. He also encouraged me to be as strong as evergreen pines in winter and summer, to grow and temper myself in harsh environments. He said, "A revolutionary youth must be able to withstand the test of difficulties and struggles..." This spring festival, he returned to Changchun on leave, and from his words and deeds, I felt that he had truly become a revolutionary warrior. However, he always felt that his progress was not fast enough and that he was still far from the Party's requirements. He said, "In the future, I will strive to transform my thoughts and keep up with the pace of the times!"

Comrade Liu Yingjun has left us forever. When I think that he can no longer contribute his strength to the construction of socialism, I am saddened; but when I think of his heroic deeds, I feel full of strength. In the future, I will, like him, study and apply Chairman Mao's works; like him, sincerely serve the people, and with several times the effort, complete the work he did not finish, advancing in his footsteps!

    踏着英俊的脚步前进
    郭淑芝
    我怀着异常激动的心情，打开了报道刘英俊同志英勇献身的报纸，一副最熟悉的面孔出现在我的面前，我真不敢相信这就是我的表弟英俊！我一遍又一遍读着，读着，被他的英雄行为深深地感动着。弟弟做对了，他做了伟大的毛泽东时代一个青年所应该做的一切。他生前说过，人的生命是短暂的，但是只要象雷锋、王杰同志那样，一心为革命，一心为人民，短暂的生命就会放射出永不熄灭的光彩。他说的太好了，做的太好了。
    是毛泽东思想的阳光雨露，使这棵幼苗健康茁壮地成长起来，是革命大熔炉，把他炼得如此坚强。他的成长道路是我们时代每个青年所应走的共同道路。他没有辜负党的培养和人民的期望。我要向他学习，把他没有读完的毛主席的书读下去，把他没有走完的路走下去，把他没有写完的日记写下去。象他那样，为人民的利益贡献出自己的一切，甚至生命。
    弟弟生前经常给我来信，谈他学习毛主席著作的体会。他说：“我学习了《为人民服务》，懂得了生和死的意义，我要生为人民生，死为人民死，象张思德那样，党叫干啥就干啥，决不碌碌无为地虚度年华。”又说：“我学习了《纪念白求恩》，知道了应该做个什么样的人，我虽然不能和白求恩相比，但我有决心象他那样，毫不利己，专门利人，为全人类的解放事业，贡献出自己的鲜血和力量。”
    “我学习了《愚公移山》，知道了应该怎样对待工作和困难，浑身增加了力量。”
    他最热爱用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。一九六三年，全国各地热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，开展了向雷锋同志学习的活动。是他，第一个把雷锋同志的日记抄给我，把雷锋同志的照片剪下来寄给我。从他的来信中，可以看出，他被雷锋同志的崇高品质强烈地感染着。他说：“我们一定要象雷锋同志那样，把有限的生命，投入到无限的为人民服务之中去，做一个永不生锈的螺丝钉，当一个无名的英雄！”以后，他多次来信，都在信封上写上了雷锋的话，愿我们共勉。一九六五年，当又一个伟大的共产主义战士王杰出现以后，又是他第一个来信向我介绍了王杰同志的英雄事迹。他严格对照检查了自己，说：“我没有象王杰同志那样，一心为革命，一心为人民，有时还有个人打算，怎么能配做一个革命战士呢？我真恨自己，今后一定向王杰同志学习，不怕苦，不怕死，‘完全’、‘彻底’地为人民服务。”他还说：“美帝国主义象发了疯似地侵略越南，我恨不得立刻奔向越南，向美帝国主义开炮。我已做好了一切准备，包括牺牲在内。只要党一声号令，我立刻奔向最前线，把青春和生命献给世界人民最需要的时刻。”可见，他早就有了英勇献身的思想准备。
    他能够热心地帮助别人，也最乐于接受别人的批评和帮助。他经常把报纸上刊登的毛主席语录剪下来，贴在信封上寄给我，叫我努力学习，坚定在林区扎根的思想。他还鼓励我，要“象冬夏常青的松柏一样坚强”，要“在艰苦的环境里锻炼成长”。他说：“一个革命青年，必须经得起困难和斗争的考验……”。今年春节，他请假回到长春，我从他的言谈举止当中，觉得他真是变了，变成一个真正的革命战士了。可是，他总是感到自己进步还不快，距离党的要求还很远。他说：“我今后还要努力改造思想，跟上时代前进的步伐！”
    刘英俊同志永远地离开了我们。当我想到他再也不能为社会主义建设贡献自己力量的时候，我悲痛；但我想到他的英雄壮举，又感到浑身充满了力量。今后我决心象他那样，活学活用毛主席著作；象他那样真心实意地为人民服务，用几倍的力量来把他没有做完的工作做好，踏着他的脚步前进！		（新华社二十一日讯）
