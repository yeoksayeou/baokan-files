	Botswana representative Dikobe Ontumez today at the emergency conference of Asian and African writers pointed out that the Cairo split meeting convened by pseudo-revolutionaries enabled us to distinguish who our true friends are and who our true enemies are, thereby allowing us to heighten our vigilance and fight against imperialism and neocolonialism led by the United States, including their lackeys and reactionaries.

	He said, we unanimously support the statement of the permanent bureau of Asian and African writers that the splitters from the Soviet Union have fundamentally severed themselves from the ranks of Asian and African writers and have forever lost all rights and positions in the permanent bureau of Asian and African writers.

	Ontumez expressed firm support for the struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialism. He said, the struggle of the Vietnamese people against the enemy of humanity, U.S. imperialism, is a great and significant contribution to the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as to all oppressed peoples in the world. He said, the struggle of the Vietnamese people is our struggle, and the victory of the Vietnamese people is our victory. We must condemn and expose those counter-revolutionaries and pseudo-revolutionaries who only give lip service to the support of the Vietnamese people.

	He said, writers from Asian and African countries and regions have the task of using their pens to promote the struggle of oppressed peoples against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States. We have the responsibility to make our literary and artistic works revolutionary in all fields to serve the interests of the peoples of Africa, Asia, and the world.

	Ontumez said, undoubtedly, the socialist cultural revolution in China is an inspiration to Asian and African writers and has given us great courage to carry out our duties as writers. Our works in all fields should be directed against imperialism, old and new colonialism, including reactionaries and lackeys of imperialism. Our duty is to use our revolutionary views to fight for and maintain national independence.

    贝专纳代表翁图梅兹的发言
    新华社三十日讯　贝专纳代表迪科贝·翁图梅兹今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上指出，由假革命者召开的开罗分裂会议，使我们能够辨别谁是我们真正的朋友，谁是我们真正的敌人，从而使我们能够提高警惕，同以美国为首的帝国主义殖民主义和新殖民主义，包括他们的走狗和反动派进行斗争。
    他说，我们一致支持亚非作家常设局会议的声明，即分裂主义的苏联作家已经从根本上自绝于亚非作家的队伍，并且永远丧失了在亚非作家常设局的一切权利和地位。
    翁图梅兹对越南人民反对美帝国主义的斗争表示坚决的支持。他说，越南人民反对人类敌人美帝国主义的斗争是对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民以及世界上所有被压迫人民的巨大和重要的贡献。他说，越南人民的斗争就是我们的斗争，越南人民的胜利也是我们的胜利。我们应当谴责和揭露那些对越南人民的支持只有一些口惠的反革命和假革命者。
    他说，亚非国家和地区的作家都有任务用他们的笔杆，来促进被压迫人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义的斗争。我们有责任使我们在一切领域里的文艺作品革命化，来为非洲、亚洲和全世界人民的利益服务。
    翁图梅兹说，毫无疑问，中国的社会主义文化大革命是对亚非作家的鼓舞，并给了我们巨大的勇气来执行作家的任务。我们在一切领域中的作品应当把矛头指向帝国主义、新老殖民主义，包括反动派和帝国主义的走狗。我们的职责是应当用我们的革命观点来争取和维护民族独立。
