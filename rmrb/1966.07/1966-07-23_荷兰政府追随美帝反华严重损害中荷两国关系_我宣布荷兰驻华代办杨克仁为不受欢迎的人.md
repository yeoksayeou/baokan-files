The Dutch government has long followed U.S. imperialism and pursued an anti-China policy, seriously damaging Sino-Dutch relations. I hereby declare the Dutch Charge d'Affaires in China, Yang Keren, as an unwelcome person.

	New China News Agency, July 22nd: On July 22nd, Xie Li, Director of the Western European Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, summoned the Dutch Charge d'Affaires in China, Yang Keren, and announced on behalf of the Chinese government that he is an unwelcome person.

	Xie Li pointed out sternly that the Dutch government has long followed U.S. imperialism and pursued an anti-China policy. Recently, during the International Institute of Welding conference held in the Netherlands, the Dutch government actually allowed American spies to illegally attempt to seduce members of the Chinese delegation to betray their country. After this plot by U.S. imperialism failed, on July 19th, the Dutch government unreasonably declared the Chinese Charge d'Affaires in the Netherlands, Li Enqiu, as an "unwelcome person" and ordered him to leave within a specified period. At the same time, it unreasonably restricted the members of the Chinese delegation attending the International Institute of Welding conference from leaving the Netherlands and issued subpoenas to illegally interrogate them. The Dutch government's actions blatantly violate basic international norms and seriously damage Sino-Dutch relations. Xie Li pointed out that the attitude of the Dutch government is extremely arrogant and unreasonable. Therefore, the Chinese government has no choice but to declare the Dutch Charge d'Affaires in China, Yang Keren, as an unwelcome person. However, until the Chinese delegation attending the International Institute of Welding conference safely leaves the Netherlands, he will not be allowed to leave China.

    荷兰政府追随美帝反华严重损害中荷两国关系
    我宣布荷兰驻华代办杨克仁为不受欢迎的人
    新华社二十二日讯　七月二十二日，外交部西欧司司长谢黎召见了荷兰驻中国代办杨克仁，代表中国政府宣布他为不受欢迎的人。
    谢黎司长严正指出，荷兰政府长期以来追随美帝国主义，奉行反华政策。最近，在国际焊接学会会议在荷兰召开期间，荷兰政府竟然纵容美国特务，向出席该会议的中国代表团人员非法进行策动他们背叛祖国的阴谋活动。在美帝国主义的这一阴谋失败后，七月十九日，荷兰政府竟无理地宣布中华人民共和国驻荷兰代办李恩求为“不受欢迎的人”，并限期离境。同时，又无理限制中国出席国际焊接学会会议的代表团人员离开荷兰，并发出传票，要对他们进行非法传讯。荷兰政府的这种做法，粗暴地破坏了起码的国际关系准则，严重地损害了中荷两国关系。谢黎司长指出，荷兰政府的态度是极端蛮横无理的，为此，中国政府不能不宣布荷兰驻中国代办杨克仁为不受欢迎的人，但在中国出席国际焊接学会会议的代表团人员安全离开荷兰之前，暂时不能离开中国。
