The last fragment of the bullet in the head of combat hero Mai Xiande has been successfully removed, and his health is rapidly recovering. The news has brought immense excitement.

The medical staff who participated in this complex surgery said it well: "This is another triumph for Mao Zedong Thought!"

Throughout the process of this extraordinary surgery, all medical staff held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, acting strictly in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. They did exactly as Chairman Mao said. Following Mao's teachings on strategic contempt for the enemy and tactical respect for the enemy, they did not engage in battles without preparation or without confidence. They made the most thorough preparations for this surgery. They conducted meticulous investigations and research on Mai Xiande's condition, and repeatedly discussed and revised the surgical plan. Using the great Mao Zedong Thought as guidance was the decisive factor in successfully completing this surgery.

The Party and Chairman Mao's affectionate care for Mai Xiande, the nation's boundless love for the hero, and the enthusiastic support from many medical units—all of this fully demonstrated the blood bond between the Party and the masses, the deep fraternity of the class, the spirit of communist cooperation, and the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system.

Mai Xiande sustained a severe head injury but continued to fight for three hours, which is a miracle. To heal Mai Xiande's severe injuries is another miracle. From this, we see once again that as long as we arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, any human miracle can be created.

We have good news to report to our readers: Under the affectionate care of the Party and Chairman Mao, and after the concerted efforts of experts and medical staff from all over the country, the combat hero Mai Xiande, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has successfully undergone his final surgery. The bullet fragment in his skull has been removed, and his health is gradually recovering. His memory and cognitive abilities are improving, and he is able to speak more each day. The medical staff who treated Mai Xiande said: "This is another triumph for Mao Zedong Thought!"

We must heal Mai Xiande's injuries!

Combat hero Mai Xiande was sent to the Guangzhou Military Region General Hospital in mid-August last year. After admission, the medical staff spared no effort, using the most effective treatment methods, day and night fighting against the life-threatening head injury. They overcame brain swelling, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, bacterial infections, and other threats, ensuring Mai Xiande's safety. However, a bullet fragment remained in his skull, his cognitive abilities were severely impaired, he could only speak simple words, his right limb was slightly paralyzed, and sometimes he exhibited mental symptoms due to the brain injury.

During this period, Comrades He Long and Ye Jianying visited the hospital to express Mai Xiande's greetings from Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao. Comrades Dong Biwu and Tao Zhu also visited Mai Xiande. After learning about Mai Xiande's recovery and treatment, Tao Zhu instructed the medical staff to definitely remove the bullet fragment from Mai Xiande's skull and solemnly reminded them: "Mai Xiande is a hero armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Use every means to help him recover his health. Spare no effort, provide whatever medicine is needed, and ensure he gets whatever he needs. Definitely heal Mai Xiande's injuries!"

During this period, the leaders of the Guangzhou Military Region and the Navy Party Committee also gave Mai Xiande multifaceted care and attention.

The people of the entire nation were also deeply concerned for the hero. Letters of encouragement poured in like snowflakes, with up to 780 letters received in a single day. A soldier stationed in the capital sent Mai Xiande a small packet of pine seeds from Tiananmen, wishing him a speedy recovery and to stand tall like a revolutionary pine tree. Red scarves brought the sincere hearts of Young Pioneers to Mai Xiande's side. People from all over the country sent countless prescriptions for treating brain injuries and mild paralysis, along with batches of gifts. Everyone shared a common wish: to heal Mai Xiande's injuries as soon as possible!

The Days and Nights Before the Surgery

The Party and the people's affectionate care for Mai Xiande inspired the medical staff to work day and night to prepare for the surgery to remove the bullet fragment from Mai Xiande's head.

The hospital party committee issued a call to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, eliminate all personal desires, make the most thorough preparations, and strive for a complete victory in the surgery." They repeatedly organized medical staff to study "Three Articles," "Two Articles," and Chairman Mao's teachings on strategy and tactics, urging everyone to establish the thought of "completely and thoroughly" serving the people and use the method of "one divides into two" to analyze the condition and focus on the key points. They ensured that Mao Zedong Thought took root in the minds of all medical staff.

The entire neurosurgery department, responsible for the main treatment of removing the bullet fragment from Mai Xiande's head, followed Chairman Mao's instructions under the leadership of the party branch. They conducted thorough investigations, analyses, and research on Mai Xiande's condition and proposed a surgical plan. The hospital party committee organized relevant experts within the hospital to repeatedly discuss and revise the surgical plan six times based on Mai Xiande's condition.

To accurately locate the bullet fragment, the chief of neurosurgery spent countless sleepless nights until he was certain of the bullet fragment's position in Mai Xiande's skull, only then did he feel at ease.

The special care team worked more than twelve hours a day, sparing no effort to help Mai Xiande recover his health, strengthen his physique, and prepare for the surgery. They went to great lengths to ensure Mai Xiande ate more food and vegetables. The laboratory established a special testing group, assigning the best technicians to handle related testing work.

Mai Xiande also actively cooperated with the doctors and nurses, strengthening his physique and preparing for the surgery. When Nurse Li Jin'e told him about the surgery, he excitedly said, "Good, after the surgery, recover health, and return to the front lines!" Two weeks before the surgery, he needed to be injected with insulin daily. When the nurse told him it was to prepare for the surgery, he immediately said, "Go ahead, I'm not afraid!" On some days, due to the heat, he lost interest in food, but he diligently studied Chairman Mao's words, "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." He decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, eat heartily, and strengthen his body to prepare for the surgery.

Support from All Directions

As soon as the news of the surgery to remove the bullet fragment from Mai Xiande's skull spread, warm hands reached out from all directions.

After learning that Mai Xiande needed a membrane to repair the skull defect after the bullet fragment was removed, the Institute of Blood Research under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences immediately sent their newly developed fibrin membrane by plane.

When a large amount of blood was needed for Mai Xiande's major surgery, the soldiers of a certain unit in the Navy, upon hearing the news, eagerly donated blood.

Medical staff from various medical units across the country also enthusiastically contributed their wisdom and strength to ensure the success of Mai Xiande's surgery.

In Guangzhou, experts from the neurosurgery and neurology departments of Sun Yat-sen University and the First People's Hospital gathered at the General Hospital, seriously discussing the surgical plan and offering advice.

Almost at the same time, surgical treatment plans were sent to various places.

The Beijing Union Medical College, Xuanwu Hospital, Shenyang Military Region General Hospital, and the attached hospital of a certain military medical university in Xi'an received the plan and held discussions organized by their party committees. They carefully reviewed every detail of the plan and solemnly replied to the General Hospital with their surgical opinions.

When the General Hospital requested relevant experts to participate in the surgery to ensure Mai Xiande's absolute safety, medical units in Beijing, Shenyang, Xi'an, and other places immediately dispatched top neurosurgery experts to assist. Their wish was: not to disappoint the expectations of the people across the country, to ensure the surgery's success, and to help Mai Xiande recover as soon as possible.

Fighting for the Best Outcome of the Surgery

The moment to remove the bullet fragment had arrived!

On the evening of May 17, a tense pre-surgery mobilization meeting was underway. Party Committee Secretary Wei Haoran read a letter from the Political Department of the Guangzhou Military Region:

"…This surgery is not an ordinary surgery; it is a surgery that reflects the Party and our beloved leader Chairman Mao's deep concern for the combat hero. It is a surgery entrusted by the people of the entire nation…." Wei Haoran called on all medical staff to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and fight for the best outcome of the surgery!

At 9:00 AM on May 18, the battle to remove the bullet fragment from the head of the combat hero, presided over by Party Committee Secretary Wei Haoran, began.

Leaders from various units of the Guangzhou Military Region and the Navy cast their concerned gazes into the operating room. Inside the operating room, the atmosphere was serious and tense. Under the guidance of a nationally renowned neurosurgery expert, the surgeons followed the original plan, performing the surgery with tension, calmness, boldness, and meticulousness. They did not drink a drop of water or eat a bite of food during the six-hour surgery. Operating room nurse Chen Huifang remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on being extremely responsible for work, accurately, timely, and error-free handing over surgical instruments to the surgeons.

Outside the operating room, everyone indirectly participating in this battle actively contributed their strength to ensure the surgery's smooth progress. The driver parked the car at the operating room door, ready for emergencies; the power supply personnel carefully guarded the backup generator, ready to use it in case of a power outage. The Guangzhou Power Supply Company, to ensure normal power supply, specially dispatched two of their best technicians to monitor the lines. These two technicians, from 7:00 AM to the end of the surgery, stood by the transformer, watching the lines. Hospital staff tried to persuade them to rest inside, but they refused; at noon, when called to the dining hall for meals, they politely declined. They said: "This is a battle station, and the battle has not ended, so we cannot leave our post!"

Time passed second by second. The surgery proceeded tensely but in an orderly manner. The surgeon skillfully opened Mai Xiande's skull, cut the dura mater, and searched for the bullet fragment. After two hours and ten minutes of intense battle, they successfully removed the bullet fragment, measuring two centimeters long and one and a half centimeters wide, from Mai Xiande's brain. After removing the brain scar and suturing the dura mater and repairing the skull, the six-hour and thirty-minute surgery battle was victorious.

To Ensure Mai Xiande's Quick Recovery

After the surgery, the responsible comrades of the General Hospital and the participating medical staff continuously stayed by Mai Xiande's side, carefully observing his breathing, consciousness, and limb movements, accurately measuring his blood pressure and body temperature, and meticulously feeling his pulse. Every slow and steady pulse beat of Mai Xiande caused them concern.

To ensure Mai Xiande's quick recovery after the surgery, the doctors took turns on duty in the post-operative observation room, closely monitoring changes in his condition, and the party committee personally presided over daily consultations three times a day.

The special care team of nurses stayed by Mai Xiande's side for more than ten days after the surgery, working sixteen hours a day, watching his every move without rest. When they were extremely tired, they ate sour plums, drank strong tea, and washed their faces with cold water to refresh their spirits. To restore Mai Xiande's consciousness and cognitive abilities, the nurses read Chairman Mao's quotations to him every day, told revolutionary stories, and brought a small blackboard to teach him to write and do arithmetic.

Mai Xiande himself, with great heroism, endured all the pain and strengthened his exercises. The day after the surgery, the nurses found fluid accumulation at the incision site, which needed to be drained immediately. Draining the fluid was extremely painful. Mai Xiande said, "No fear, go ahead!" To reduce his pain, Nurse Yang Shengtao told Mai Xiande, "Sing a song!" Mai Xiande immediately sang "The East Is Red" loudly, followed by "The Ship Sails with the Helmsman." Before the fluid was completely drained, he tightly held Nurse Li Jin'e's hand and said, "Tell me a story about Ouyang Hai!" Nurse Yang Shengtao, moved, told him a story about how Ouyang Hai fought against difficulties. Finally, the fluid was drained, and Mai Xiande was covered in cold sweat from the pain, but he did not utter a sound from beginning to end. Yang Shengtao said, "Little Mai, you are truly amazing!" He smiled and said, "Recover health, return to the front lines!"

More than ten days later, Mai Xiande walked out of the surgical ward and went outside for exercise. He practiced gripping strength, played badminton and basketball, and actively participated in all activities that could strengthen his physique.

The efforts of the medical staff and Mai Xiande's persistent exercises brought the hero's health back. Compared to before the surgery, Mai Xiande's consciousness was clearer, his speech was more articulate, his vocabulary increased, and his limbs were more agile. Since early June, he has actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. When the nurse read him the news of the Central Committee's decision to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Committee, he excitedly raised his arm and shouted, "Firmly support the Central Committee's decision, eliminate all enemies." "Long live Chairman Mao!"

According to relevant medical staff, it will not be long before Mai Xiande can be transferred to a convalescent hospital for recovery treatment, and after a period, he will return to his work post.

Mao Zedong Thought armed combat hero Mai Xiande. Medical staff armed with Mao Zedong Thought saved Mai Xiande's life. The Party, Chairman Mao, and the people of the entire nation gave Mai Xiande a new life to fight. From the victorious battle to restore Mai Xiande's health, people clearly saw the Party and the people's deep concern for an ordinary soldier and were deeply proud to have a great Party and a great leader, Chairman Mao!

    毛泽东思想的又一首凯歌
    ——记摘除战斗英雄麦贤得头部弹片前后
    编者按：战斗英雄麦贤得头颅中最后一块弹片已经顺利取出，健康正在迅速恢复。消息传来，令人万分兴奋。
    参加这次复杂手术的医务人员说得好：“这是毛泽东思想的又一首凯歌！”
    在进行这次极不寻常的手术的过程中，全体医务人员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，自始至终按照毛主席的指示办事。毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做。他们遵循毛主席关于在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人，不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗的教导，为这次手术做了最充分的准备。他们对麦贤得的伤情进行了周密细致的调查研究，对手术方案做了反复讨论、反复修改。用伟大的毛泽东思想作指导，是圆满完成这次手术的决定性关键。
    党和毛主席对麦贤得的亲切关怀，全国人民对英雄的无限热爱，许多医疗单位的热情支援，这一切的一切，充分体现了党和群众的血肉关系，体现了阶级弟兄的深厚情谊，体现了共产主义协作精神，体现了我们国家社会主义制度的无比优越。
    麦贤得同志头部负重伤，仍然坚持战斗三小时，是一个奇迹。能把麦贤得如此严重的创伤治好，这又是一个奇迹。从这里，我们再一次看到，只要认真用毛泽东思想武装头脑，任何人间奇迹都能创造出来。
    我们向读者报告个好消息：在党和毛主席的亲切关怀下，经过全国各地专家和医务人员全力治疗，用毛泽东思想武装起来的战斗英雄麦贤得已经顺利地完成最后一次手术，取出了存留在颅内的弹片，健康逐渐恢复，记忆力和思维能力增强，能讲的话也一天比一天多起来了。参加治疗麦贤得的医务人员说：“这是毛泽东思想的又一首凯歌！”
    一定要把麦贤得的伤治好！
    战斗英雄麦贤得，是去年八月中旬被送到广州部队总医院的。入院后，医务人员千方百计，用最有效的治疗方法，日日夜夜同威胁麦贤得生命的头部重伤作斗争，战胜了脑水肿、脑脊液鼻漏、细菌感染等威胁，保证了麦贤得的生命安全。但他颅内仍存留着一块弹片，思维能力很差，只能讲简单的话，右肢轻度瘫痪，有时还由于脑外伤引起一些精神症状。
    这期间，贺龙、叶剑英同志曾到医院探望麦贤得，向他转达了毛主席、林彪副主席的亲切问候。董必武、陶铸同志也到医院探望过麦贤得。陶铸同志详细了解了麦贤得的健康恢复情况及治疗情况以后，指示医务人员一定要把麦贤得颅内的弹片摘除，并郑重地叮嘱医务人员：“麦贤得是毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄，要用一切办法帮助他恢复健康，不惜一切力量，要用什么药给什么药，要吃什么给什么，一定要把麦贤得的伤治好！”
    这期间，广州部队负责人、海军党委和领导人，也都给予麦贤得以多方面的关怀和照顾。
    全国人民也满腔热情，关怀英雄。慰问信象雪片飞来，最多一天达七百八十多封。驻守在首都的哨兵，给麦贤得寄来一小包天安门的松籽，祝麦贤得早日恢复健康，永作一株凌风傲雪的革命青松。一条条红领巾，带来一颗颗少先队员的赤诚的心，飞到麦贤得身边……。人们还从天南地北寄来数不清的治疗脑外伤和轻度瘫痪的秘方和一批批的慰问品。大家都有一个共同的愿望：早日把麦贤得的伤治好！
    手术前的日日夜夜
    党和人民对麦贤得的亲切关怀，鼓舞着医务人员日日夜夜为做好摘除麦贤得头部弹片手术出力。
    医院党委发出“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，排除一切私心杂念，作好最充分的准备，为取得手术的彻底胜利而努力”的号召，并且反复组织医护人员学习“老三篇”、“两论”和毛主席有关战略战术的论述，要求大家树立起“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想，运用“一分为二”的方法去分析病情，抓关键。让毛泽东思想在全体医务人员头脑里扎根。
    担任摘除麦贤得头部弹片主要治疗任务的脑神经外科全体同志在党支部的领导下，按照毛主席的指示，对麦贤得的病情，作了周密细致的调查、分析、研究，提出手术方案。医院党委根据麦贤得伤情组织院内有关专家反复讨论，六次修改手术方案。
    为了准确地找到弹片的位置，脑外科主任费尽心思，不知熬过多少不眠之夜，直到把麦贤得颅内弹片的位置弄得没有丝毫误差，方才放心。
    特护小组的同志，每天都工作十二小时以上，千方百计地去帮助麦贤得恢复健康，增强体质，迎接手术。他们为了使麦贤得多吃一口饭、一口菜，不知费尽多少心血。化验科专门成立化验小组，指定技术最好的技师担任有关的化验工作。
    麦贤得也主动和医生护士配合，增强体质，迎接开刀。当护士长李金爱把开刀的事情告诉他的时候，他兴奋地说：“好，开完刀，恢复健康，重返前线！”开刀前两个星期，每天要注射胰岛素，当护士告诉他是为了迎接开刀的需要以后，他立刻说：“来吧，我不怕！”有几天，天热，他对饭菜不感兴趣，就认真学习毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的语录，表示下决心象毛主席教导的那样去做，为了增强体力、迎接开刀，便大口大口地吃起来。
    四面八方热情支援
    为麦贤得做颅内弹片摘除手术消息一传开，四面八方伸出了温暖的手。
    给麦贤得取出弹片后需要修补脑膜缺损，中国医学科学院输血及血液研究所知道后，立刻由飞机送来他们最新研究出来的纤维蛋白膜。
    给麦贤得进行大手术时需要大量输血。海军某部战士获悉这一消息后，人人争相献血。
    各地医疗单位医务人员，也热情为麦贤得做好手术贡献自己的智慧和力量。
    在广州，中山医学院、市第一人民医院的脑神经外科、脑内科专家云集总医院，认真讨论着手术方案，出谋献计。
    几乎同一时刻，手术治疗方案寄到各地。
    北京协和医院、宣武医院，沈阳部队总医院，驻西安某军医大学附属医院接到方案后，党委专门召集有关人员举行讨论，认真研究审查方案的每一个细节。最后郑重地把手术意见回复总医院。
    当总医院提出请有关专家来参加手术，以保证麦贤得同志的绝对安全时，北京、沈阳、西安等地医疗单位，立即派出了全国第一流的脑外科专家，赶来协助。他们的心愿是：决不辜负全国人民的期望，保证手术顺利，帮助麦贤得尽快恢复健康。
    为手术的最好效果而战斗
    摘除弹片战斗的时刻到了！
    五月十七日晚上，手术前动员大会紧张地进行着。党委书记魏浩然读着广州部队政治部寄来的一封信：
  “……这次手术，绝不是一次平常的手术，而是倾注了党和我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席对战斗英雄深切关怀的一次手术，是全国人民众望所托的一次手术……。”魏浩然号召全体医务人员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬无产阶级革命精神，为手术的最好效果而战斗！
    五月十八日上午九时，由党委书记魏浩然亲自主持的、为摘除战斗英雄头部弹片的战斗开始了。
    广州部队和海军一些单位的负责人在手术室外向手术室投进无限关切的目光。手术室内，一片严肃紧张的气氛。在全国著名的脑外科专家指导下，手术者按照原定方案，紧张、沉着、大胆、细致地进行手术。他们在六个多小时的手术中，不进一滴水，不吃一口饭。手术室护士长陈惠芳牢记毛主席关于对工作极端负责的教导，准确、及时、毫无差错地把手术器械一件件递到手术者手中。
    手术室外，间接参加这场战斗的每个人，都积极为手术的顺利进行贡献力量。汽车司机把车子开到手术室门口，以待急用；供电人员认真地看守着备用的发电机，以便一旦供电中断时立即使用；广州市供电公司为了保证正常供电，特地派了两名技术最好的电工来看管线路。这两位电工从上午七点多钟开始到手术完毕，一直守在变压器旁边，凝视着线路，医院的同志劝他们到屋内去休息一会，他们不去；中午叫他们到饭堂吃饭，他们婉言谢绝。他们说：“这是战斗岗位，战斗没有结束，就不能离开岗位！”
    时间一分一秒地过去。手术紧张而有条不紊地进行。手术医生熟悉地给麦贤得打开颅骨，切开硬脑膜，探查弹片……。经过二小时又十分钟的紧张战斗，终于顺利地把留在麦贤得脑子里的长二厘米、阔一厘米多的弹片取出；再经过摘除脑瘢疤，缝合脑膜、修补颅骨……前后历时六个钟头又三十分钟，手术战斗胜利了。
    为了麦贤得尽快恢复健康
    手术后，总医院负责同志、参加手术的医务人员，不间断地守候在麦贤得的身边，细心观察麦贤得的呼吸、意识和肢体活动情况，认真量度血压和体温，细致按摸脉搏的跳动。麦贤得每次快快慢慢的脉搏跳动，都引起他们操心。
    为了麦贤得手术后尽快恢复健康，医生们在手术后观察室里，轮流值班，严密观察病情变化，并由党委亲自主持坚持每天三次会诊。
    特护小组的护士们在麦贤得手术后十多天里，每天工作十六小时，守候在麦贤得身边，分秒不歇地仔细察看着麦贤得的动静。疲倦极了，就吃酸梨、喝浓茶、洗冷水脸，提醒精神。为了恢复麦贤得的意识思维能力，护士每天都给他念毛主席语录，讲革命故事，还拿来一块小黑板，给他上课，一笔一划地教他写字，做算术……。
    麦贤得自己也以高度的英雄气概，忍受一切痛楚，加强锻炼。开刀后的第二天，护士发现他刀口处有积液，必须立即抽出，抽积液是异常疼痛的。麦贤得却说：“不怕，抽吧！”为了减轻他的疼痛，护士杨声桃对麦贤得说：“唱个歌吧！”麦贤得立即高声唱起《东方红》，接着又唱《大海航行靠舵手》。积液还没有抽完，他紧紧攒着护士长李金爱的手说：“再讲一段欧阳海吧！”护士杨声桃激动地给他讲了一段欧阳海怎样和困难作斗争的故事。积液终于抽完了，麦贤得疼得出了一身冷汗，可他从头到尾，连一声也没吭。杨声桃说：“小麦，你可真了不起啊！”他笑笑说：“恢复健康，重返前线！”
    十几天后，麦贤得走出了手术病房，就到外面去锻炼。他一会练握力，一会又去打羽毛球和篮球，凡是能够增强体质的活动，他都积极参加。
    医护人员的心血和麦贤得的顽强锻炼，换来了英雄身体的健康。较之手术前，麦贤得意识更加清醒，发音比较清晰，语汇增多，四肢也比较灵活了。六月初以来，他积极参加了无产阶级文化大革命。当护士给他读中共中央决定改组北京市委的消息的时候，他激动地举臂高呼：“坚决拥护党中央的决定，消灭一切敌人。”“毛主席万岁！”
    据有关医务人员说，用不了多久，麦贤得就可以转到疗养院去进行恢复治疗，再过一段时间，就将重返工作岗位了。
    毛泽东思想武装了战斗英雄麦贤得。毛泽东思想武装起来的医务人员，又把麦贤得垂危的生命救活过来。党、毛主席和全国人民给了麦贤得新的战斗生命。人们从为麦贤得恢复健康的胜利战斗中，清楚地看到党和人民对一个普通战士的深切关怀，深深为我们有伟大的党和伟大领袖毛主席而自豪！
