The conference is convinced that it represents the peace-loving, freedom-loving, and justice-seeking peoples of Asia and Africa, as well as the progressive public opinion of the world. The conference unanimously notes:

The American imperialists and their puppets in Bangkok and Saigon have been continually violating Cambodia's airspace, bombing peaceful villages along the border, and indiscriminately slaughtering men, women, children, and livestock. The U.S. South Vietnamese artillery and armored units frequently invade Cambodia, committing massacres, looting, and destroying villages in Cambodia's border provinces. These beasts spread chemical poisons, causing severe damage to crops, killing livestock and residents.

In the north, the Bangkok puppets have sent their troops to the border regions between Cambodia and Thailand, attacking Cambodian outposts, killing residents, looting livestock, and destroying railways, roads, and paths, thereby undermining Cambodia's economic foundation.

Recently, the Bangkok puppets of American imperialism have once again seized the Preah Vihear Temple, which they had previously seized and were forced to return to Cambodia by the International Court of Justice in The Hague in 1962.

American imperialism, through its seemingly harmless cultural institutions, interferes with and corrupts Cambodia's national culture. To eradicate this poison, under the wise leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Royal Government of Cambodia expelled the Americans and all their cultural organizations.

The conference firmly supports the peaceful, neutral, independent policy led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the People's Socialist Community, and the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

    关于柬埔寨的决议
    会议确信它是亚非爱好和平、自由、正义人民以及世界进步舆论的代表，会议一致注意到：
    美帝国主义和它的曼谷、西贡的仆从不断侵犯柬埔寨领空，轰炸边境上的和平村庄，任意屠杀男人、妇女、儿童和牲口。美国南越炮兵和装甲部队经常侵犯柬埔寨，进行屠杀、抢劫，破坏柬埔寨边境省份的村庄。这些野兽在那里散布化学毒药给庄稼造成严重损失，杀死牲畜和居民。
    在北方，曼谷仆从把它的军队派到柬埔寨和泰国的边境地区，袭击柬埔寨的警所，杀害居民，抢劫牲口，破坏铁路、公路和小路，破坏柬埔寨经济基础。
    近来，美帝国主义的曼谷仆从又从柬埔寨夺去了过去他们曾经夺去而在一九六二年被海牙国际法庭迫使归还给柬埔寨的隆端古寺。
    美帝国主义通过它的表面上看来没有危害的文化机构干预和败坏柬埔寨的民族文化。为了根除这个毒害，在诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王的英明领导下，柬埔寨王国政府赶走了美国人和他们的一切文化组织。
    会议坚决支持诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王领导的人民社会同盟的和平、中立、独立的政策和柬埔寨王国的领土完整。
