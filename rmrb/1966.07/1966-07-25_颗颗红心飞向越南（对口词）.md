	甲: Where there is aggression,
	乙: There is resistance!
	甲: Look!
	乙: The Red River surges with angry waves,
	甲: The bamboo forests stand tall with guns.
	甲: Every palm tree,
	乙: Is a steel sword of revenge;
	甲: Every inch of soil,
	乙: Ignites the flame of struggle.
	甲: The indomitable Vietnamese people,
	乙: Hold deep hatred in their hearts.
	甲: Setting traps,
	乙: Shooting arrows,
	甲: Sharpening bamboo spikes,
	乙: Wielding knives and guns.
	甲: Fight!
	乙: Fight!
	甲: Fight until the paper tiger,
	乙: Is battered and bleeding;
	甲: Beat until the American devils,
	乙: Are terrified and fleeing.
	甲: This is the fate of those who play with fire,
	乙: This is the end of aggressors.
	甲: Good news comes from all directions,

	甲: Never forget class struggle.
	甲: Watch the world,

	甲: At the country's command,

	甲: U.S. imperialists—
	乙: If they come from the sky,
	甲: We'll send them tumbling down;
	乙: If they come from the sea,
	甲: We'll sink them to the bottom of the ocean!
	甲: Wherever they come,
	乙: We'll fight them there;
	甲: No matter how many come,
	乙: We'll fight them all!
	甲: We fear neither hardship nor death;
