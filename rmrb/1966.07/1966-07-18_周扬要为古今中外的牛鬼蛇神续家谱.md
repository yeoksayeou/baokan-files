Zhou Yang has been in control of the leadership in the compilation of textbooks for higher art and liberal arts colleges. Under the guise of compiling textbooks, he has produced a large number of poisonous weeds to extend the genealogy of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign monsters and demons. He attempts, through these "textbooks," to ensure that his gang of black elements can pass on their legacy, turning our revolutionary youth into sacrificial victims for their anti-party and anti-socialist causes.

When compiling textbooks, Zhou Yang was shamelessly aggressive. In the editorial group for "Aesthetics" and "Introduction to Art," he brazenly declared, "Aesthetics did not emerge only after Mao Zedong's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art.'" He attempted to diminish the great significance of the pinnacle of proletarian literary theory—Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." He distorted right and wrong, praising foreigners from thousands of years ago, saying, "Aristotle's 'Poetics' is superior to ours." He praised old revisionists and traitors to the proletariat, saying, "Plekhanov's contributions to Marxist-Leninist aesthetics have not been surpassed by anyone," openly opposing Mao Zedong's "Talks." He also publicly opposed our young teachers from studying Marxism, saying, "Don't read Marxism-Leninism every day; you won't find anything in it." "Of course, reading only Mao Zedong's 'Talks' won't produce revisionism, but it will produce dogmatism." He even shouted, "Put Marxism-Leninism aside and use it as a dictionary to look things up." Zhou Yang, isn't this a public challenge to Marxism-Leninism? Isn't this a blatant attack on the revolutionary people? These ironclad facts prove that you are a thorough and complete revisionist. Zhou Yang, we will never reconcile with you; as long as there are workers, peasants, and soldiers, there will be no place for you! Zhou Yang, your howls and counterattacks not only do not diminish the brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought but, on the contrary, hasten your doom.

Our great leader Mao Zedong's "Talks" brilliantly and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory, marking a new era. It proposed the most complete, thorough, and correct Marxist-Leninist literary line. We workers, peasants, and soldiers have boundless love, faith, and reverence for Mao Zedong's works. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, decisively smash and shatter the bourgeois, revisionist literary black line represented by Zhou Yang, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

　　周扬要为古今中外的牛鬼蛇神续家谱
　　中央美术学院藏族学生　意希敦曾
    周扬一直把持着高等艺术院校和文科院校教材编写工作的领导大权。他以编写教材为名，制造出一大批为古今中外牛鬼蛇神续家谱的毒草。妄图通过这些“教材”，为他们这伙黑帮传宗接代，把我们革命青年变成他们反党反社会主义的殉葬者。
    在编写教材的时候，周扬赤膊上阵，猖狂到了极点。在《美学》和《艺术概论》编写组，他大放厥词，说什么：“美学不是在《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》之后才有的。”妄图抹煞无产阶级文艺理论的顶峰——毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的伟大意义。他颠倒黑白，吹捧几千年前的洋人，说“亚里士多德的《诗学》比我们高”；他吹捧老修正主义者、无产阶级的叛徒，说“普列汉诺夫对马克思列宁主义美学的贡献还没有人超过”，公然与毛主席的《讲话》对抗。他还公开反对我们青年教师学习马克思主义，说“不要天天看马克思列宁主义，从马克思列宁主义本身看不出什么来。”“光看毛主席的《讲话》当然不会出修正主义，但会出教条主义。”还叫嚷：“把马克思列宁主义放到旁边，当字典查查就行了。”周扬，你这不是公开向马克思列宁主义挑战是什么？你这不是明目张胆地向革命人民进攻是什么？这铁一般的事实，足以证明你是一个彻头彻尾的修正主义分子。周扬，我们与你誓不两立，有我们工农兵就没有你！周扬，你的狂叫，你的反扑，不但无损于伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉，相反地，更加速了你们的末日的到来。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席的《讲话》，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论，是划时代的重要文献，它提出了一条最完整、最彻底、最正确的马克思列宁主义文艺路线。我们工农兵对毛主席著作无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把以周扬为代表的资产阶级、修正主义文艺黑线坚决打垮、砸烂，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
