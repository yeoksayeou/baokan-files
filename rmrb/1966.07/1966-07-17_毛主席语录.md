	Chairman Mao's Quotations
	The class enemy will definitely seek opportunities to reveal themselves. They are not reconciled to the loss of the country and communism. No matter how much the Communist Party warns in advance and publicly discloses its fundamental strategic principles to its enemies, the enemies will still launch attacks. Class struggle is an objective existence, independent of human will. That is to say, it is inevitable. Human will cannot avoid it, and it is impossible to do so. One can only follow the trend and seize victory.

　　毛主席语录
    阶级敌人是一定要寻找机会表现他们自己的。他们对于亡国、共产是不甘心的。不管共产党怎样事先警告，把根本战略方针公开告诉自己的敌人，敌人还要进攻的。阶级斗争是客观存在，不依人的意志为转移的。就是说，不可避免的。人的意志想要避免，也不可能。只能因势利导，夺取胜利。
