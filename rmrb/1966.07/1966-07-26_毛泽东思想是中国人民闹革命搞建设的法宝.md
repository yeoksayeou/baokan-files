According to the Xinhua News Agency, on the 25th, Cai Zucuan, the deputy leader of the Chinese Scientists Delegation and an expert in electric light sources who came from a worker's background, gave an academic report titled "Making Lamps for the Revolution" at the full meeting of the Beijing Physics Discussion Conference. He pointed out: Mao Zedong Thought boosts our revolutionary spirit. Mao Zedong Thought illuminates our path forward. Mao Zedong Thought is our magic weapon for making revolution and building the country. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force.

Cai Zucuan's report cited numerous vivid examples, introducing how he and the entire team at the Electric Light Source Experimental Laboratory of Fudan University, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strove to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldview. In scientific research, they followed Mao Zedong's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" as their guiding principles, insisting on the path of self-reliance. With the strong cooperation of relevant units, they completed in just three to four years what capitalist countries in the West took twenty to thirty years to achieve in the research of new types of electric light sources, breaking the imperialists' and modern revisionists' blockade on electric light source technology. Currently, Cai Zucuan and his team have successfully researched more than ten types of new electric light sources from scratch. The long-arc xenon lamp, known as the "second revolution in the history of lighting," was also successfully trial-produced in a short period, reaching the world's advanced level. The atomic spectrum lamps they researched and trial-produced for use as instrument light sources number in the dozens. Cai Zucuan's report resonated strongly with the scientists from various countries of the four continents attending the conference.

Cai Zucuan mentioned in his report today that we must not only make lamps but also forge people; only with revolutionary people can we make lamps for the revolution. Forging people means using Mao Zedong Thought to transform our standpoints, viewpoints, and methods. He said: With Mao Zedong Thought, we have boundless courage and high morale. With Mao Zedong Thought, we fear neither heaven nor earth, daring to fight imperialism, modern revisionism, reactionaries of all countries, and scientific backwardness. With Mao Zedong Thought, we dare to overcome all difficulties, strive for victory, and blaze our own trail.

After Cai Zucuan's report, scientists from Cambodia, Iraq, Japan, Ecuador, North Korea, Mexico, Tanzania, and the United Arab Republic eagerly shook hands with Cai Zucuan, congratulating Chinese scientists on achieving world-level success in pioneering new types of electric light sources. The leader of the Cambodian Scientists Delegation, Ji Chun, said, "After hearing Cai Zucuan's report, we understand the power of Mao Zedong Thought in scientific practice." The Tanzanian scientist Ntamila firmly grasped Cai Zucuan's hand and said, "You Chinese scientists are truly fortunate!" He asked Cai Zucuan to sign his copy of the report "Making Lamps for the Revolution" as a keepsake. The scientist from the United Arab Republic, Akad, said to Cai Zucuan, "Your scientific achievements are also our pride and glory, boosting our morale." The Algerian scientist Ramadan told the member of the Chinese Scientists Delegation, Meng Xianzhen, "Cai Zucuan's report is excellent and sets a model for other countries. Such reports are unheard of in Western academic conferences."

At today's full meeting, the North Korean scientist Zheng Qixuan gave an academic report titled "The Regularity of Internal Friction in Powdered Metals." Sintered powdered metals are a new type of material widely used in industry, but they have many internal defects and are not uniform. Previously, there was a lack of systematic and comprehensive research in this area. In recent years, the reporter and his colleagues have studied the internal defects and non-uniformity of these materials from the perspective of internal energy loss during mechanical vibration, conducting a large number of systematic experiments. They discovered many new physical phenomena related to the microscopic processes of metals and alloys and explored and studied the mechanisms of these phenomena, finding some regularities. This provides conditions for further understanding the internal defects and non-uniformity of sintered powdered metals. The North Korean scientists' report was also widely welcomed at the conference.

This morning, scientists from the four continents continued to hold academic conferences in groups, engaging in academic exchange activities. Eleven scientists from five countries read their papers at the group academic conferences.

At the basic particle group academic conference, the Japanese physicist Namiki Yoshihiro read a paper titled "Theory of Basic Particle Structure and High-Energy Reactions." This paper introduced the author's and some Japanese scientists' views on the structure of basic particles, as well as their research situation and results. Chinese physicists Li Bing'an, Du Dongsheng, and Song Xingchang, representing the Beijing Basic Particle Theory Group, read three papers on the "Quark Model" at the conference. These three papers showed that Chinese physicists actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong's philosophical viewpoint of "two into one" in scientific research, implementing the mass line, and strengthening cooperation. Thus, they achieved significant new results in exploring an important and difficult basic physics question that few people have explored: the internal structure of basic particles.

At the nuclear physics group academic conference, Japanese scientists read three papers. Yoshiki Yoshiki's paper "Interaction of Atomic Nuclei—Formation of Quasi-Molecules" provided an interesting theoretical discussion and explanation of the phenomenon where two atomic nuclei can form quasi-molecules under certain conditions. Yoshizawa Yasushi's paper "Systematic Properties of Atomic Nuclei" and Kuriyama Jun, representing the Kyoto Working Group of Japan, read a paper "Nuclear Forces and Nuclear Structure," which discussed their research work and views on the systematic properties and structure of atomic nuclei.

After Yoshiki read his paper, the executive chairman of this group's academic conference, the Chinese scientist Wu Shizhu, introduced that the Japanese scientists overcame numerous obstacles in their struggle against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to come to Beijing to attend this physics discussion conference. At this moment, scientists from various countries attending the conference applauded warmly, expressing their respect for the Japanese friends.

At the solid-state physics group academic conference, four scientists read their papers. The Moroccan scientist Bellamah Wazani's paper "Relationship Between Elasticity (Sound Velocity) and Magnetization of Several Transition Metal Alloys" theoretically explained the relationship between elasticity and magnetism, interpreting some abnormal phenomena in certain transition metal alloys and verifying them experimentally. The Sri Lankan scientist Kannangara introduced the situation and results of his research on the variation of the geomagnetic field in the equatorial region of Colombo. The scientist from the United Arab Republic, Hetti, read a paper titled "Crystallographic Analysis of Certain Silicates and Related Minerals" at the conference. The Chinese scientist Feng Duan, representing the Metal Physics Teaching and Research Room of Nanjing University, read a paper introducing their theoretical research results on dislocations and other defects in refractory metals.

Scientists from various countries participating in the physics teaching group visited the physics demonstration equipment exhibition room and the electric light source exhibition room this morning.

According to the Xinhua News Agency, on the 25th, Li Siguang, the president of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology, held a reception tonight, warmly welcoming more than one hundred scientists from over thirty countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania attending the 1966 summer physics discussion conference in Beijing.

Li Siguang, in his speech at the reception, expressed warm welcome and sincere greetings to the scientists from various countries, paying high respect to the Vietnamese scientists who came from the frontline of the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to attend this conference.

He said that the holding of this conference not only shows the common wish of scientists from the four continents to unite and cooperate and learn from each other, but also shows our determination to oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism, break their control and monopoly over science and technology, develop national science and culture, and serve the cause of national independence, world peace, and human progress.

The convener of the Beijing Physics Discussion Conference Presidium and the leader of the Japanese Scientists Delegation, Yoshiki Yoshiki, gave an enthusiastic speech at the reception. He pointed out that only by struggling against imperialism and safeguarding national independence can the scientific cause of the four continents develop. In our contact with scientists from various countries, we find that this view is shared.

He said in his speech that at yesterday's and today's academic conferences, friends from various countries gave reports based on the characteristics of their countries' scientific research work, which moved him deeply. He mentioned that he had participated in many large international academic conferences in the past, where people showed off their personal scientific research achievements, but here there was a warm and cooperative atmosphere. He said again that our unity is sincere, not just in words.

He expressed his firm belief that this physics discussion conference will achieve great success, just like the 1964 Beijing Science Discussion Conference.

Attending the reception were leaders from various departments, Han Guang, Hao Deqing, Liu Zizai, and all members of the Chinese Scientists Delegation.

The reception was filled with a friendly and united atmosphere. During the banquet, Chinese and foreign scientists had cordial conversations. Scientists from various countries frequently raised their glasses, toasting the strengthening unity of the peoples and scientists of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania.

After the reception, scientists from various countries watched the naval political department's performing arts troupe's performance of the play "Drums of the Equator."

    蔡祖泉在北京物理讨论会上作学术报告受到热烈欢迎
    毛泽东思想是中国人民闹革命搞建设的法宝
    五个国家的十一位科学家在分组会议上宣读了论文李四光举行招待会热烈欢迎四大洲科学家
    据新华社二十五日讯  中国科学家代表团副团长、工人出身的电光源专家蔡祖泉，今天下午在北京物理讨论会全体会议上所作的《为革命造灯》的学术报告中指出：毛泽东思想长我们革命的志气。毛泽东思想照亮我们前进的道路。毛泽东思想是我们闹革命搞建设的法宝。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最大的战斗力。
    蔡祖泉的报告列举大量生动事例，介绍了他和他所领导的复旦大学电光源实验室全体人员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，在科学研究中以毛主席的《实践论》和《矛盾论》为指针，坚持走自力更生的道路，在有关单位的大力协作下，只用了三、四年的时间，就走完了西方资本主义国家在研究新型电光源方面花了二、三十年才走完的路程，打破了帝国主义和现代修正主义在电光源技术方面对我们的封锁。目前，蔡祖泉他们已经从无到有地研究成功十多个品种的新型电光源。被誉为世界照明史上第二次革命的长弧氙灯
  （俗称小太阳），他们也在很短的时间内便试制成功，并且赶上了世界先进水平。他们研究和试制成功的作为仪器光源用的原子光谱灯，已经有几十种之多。蔡祖泉的报告，在参加会的四大洲各国科学家中引起了强烈的反响。
    蔡祖泉在他今天的报告中说，我们既要造灯，更要炼人；有了革命化的人，才能为革命而造灯。炼人就是用毛泽东思想改造自己的立场、观点、方法。他说：有了毛泽东思想，我们就勇气无穷，斗志昂扬。有了毛泽东思想，我们就天不怕，地不怕，敢于同帝国主义斗，同现代修正主义斗，同各国反动派斗，同科学落后斗。有了毛泽东思想，我们就敢于排除万难，去争取胜利，闯出自己的一条路来。
    蔡祖泉报告以后，柬埔寨、伊拉克、日本、厄瓜多尔、朝鲜、墨西哥、坦桑尼亚、阿联等国家的科学家，纷纷同蔡祖泉热情握手，祝贺中国科学工作者在开辟新型电光源方面取得了世界水平的成就。柬埔寨科学家代表团团长吉春说，听了蔡祖泉的报告，我们懂得了毛泽东思想在科学实践中的威力。坦桑尼亚科学家恩塔米拉紧紧握着蔡祖泉的手说：“你们中国科学家真幸福！”他请蔡祖泉在大会发给他的《为革命造灯》那篇报告上签名留念。阿联科学家阿卡德对蔡祖泉说：“你们取得的科学成就，也是我们的骄傲和光彩，长了我们的志气。”阿尔及利亚科学家拉姆丹对中国科学家代表团团员孟宪振说：“蔡祖泉的报告很好，给其他国家树立了榜样。象这样的报告，在西方的学术会议上是听不到的。”
    在今天下午的全体会议上，朝鲜科学家郑启宣作了题为《粉末金属中内耗的规律性》的学术报告。烧结的粉末金属在工业上是一种运用比较广泛的新型材料，但是这种材料内部缺陷较多，不均匀性较大，过去在这方面对它缺乏系统全面的研究。近年来，报告人及其合作者从机械振动时的内部能量损耗来研究它的内部缺陷和不均匀性的运动规律和变化过程，进行了大量的系统性的实验，发现了许多有关金属和合金微观过程的新的物理现象，并对于这些物理现象的机制进行了探索和研究，找出了一些规律性，为今后进一步了解烧结粉末金属中内部的缺陷和不均匀性提供了条件。朝鲜科学家的报告也在会上受到了普遍的欢迎。
    今天上午，四大洲各国科学家继续分组举行学术会议，进行学术交流活动。有五个国家的十一位科学家，在各组学术会议上宣读了他们的论文。
    在基本粒子组学术会议上，日本物理学家并木美喜雄，宣读了题为《基本粒子结构理论和高能反应》的论文。这篇论文，介绍了作者和日本部分科学家有关基本粒子结构的一些观点，以及其研究情况和结果。中国物理学工作者李炳安、杜东生和宋行长，代表北京基本粒子理论组，分别在会上宣读了三篇有关“层子模型”的论文。这三篇论文说明，中国物理学工作者活学活用毛主席著作，在科学研究中运用毛主席的“一分为二”的哲学观点，贯彻群众路线和加强协作，从而在探讨目前还很少有人探讨的一个重要的、困难的物理学基本课题，即基本粒子内部结构问题方面，取得了有意义的新成果。
    在原子核物理组学术会议上，日本科学家宣读了三篇论文。野上茂吉郎的论文《原子核的相互作用——准分子的形成》，对两个原子核在一定条件下能够形成准分子的现象在理论上作了有趣的讨论和说明。吉泽康和的论文《原子核的系统性质》和栗山淳代表日本京都工作组宣读的论文《核力与核结构》，阐述了他们对原子核系统性质和核结构的研究工作和一些看法。
    野上宣读了他的论文以后，这个组学术会议的执行主席、中国科学工作者吴式枢介绍说，日本科学家是经过对美日反动派的斗争，克服重重障碍，才来到北京出席这次物理讨论会的。这时，与会各国科学家热烈鼓掌，向日本朋友表示敬意。
    在固体物理组学术会议上，有四位科学家宣读了他们的论文。摩洛哥科学家贝勒马希·瓦扎尼的题为《几种过渡族金属合金的弹性（声速）与磁化率的关系》的论文，从理论上说明了弹性和磁性之间的关系，解释了一些过渡族金属合金中出现的某些反常现象，并在实验上作了验证。锡兰科学家坎南加拉的论文，介绍了作者对赤道附近科伦坡地区地磁场变化进行研究的情况和结果。阿联科学家赫提，在会上宣读了题为《某些硅酸盐和有关矿物的结晶学分析》的论文。中国科学工作者冯端，代表南京大学金属物理教研室宣读的一篇论文，介绍了他们对难熔金属中的位错和其他缺陷进行理论研究的成果。
    参加物理教学组的各国科学家们，今天上午参观了物理演示教具陈列室和电光源陈列室。
    据新华社二十五日讯  中国科学技术协会主席李四光今晚举行招待会，热烈欢迎参加北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲三十多个国家的一百多位科学家。
    李四光在招待会上致词，向各国科学家表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的问候，向从紧张的抗美救国斗争前线赶来参加这次讨论会的越南科学家致以崇高的敬意。
    他说，这次讨论会的召开，不仅表现了我们四大洲科学家团结合作和相互学习的共同愿望，也表现了我们四大洲科学家反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，打破他们对科学技术的控制和垄断，发展民族科学文化，为争取和维护民族独立，保卫世界和平和促进人类进步事业服务的决心。
    北京物理讨论会主席团会议召集人、日本科学家代表团团长野上茂吉郎在招待会上发表了热情的讲话。他指出，只有同帝国主义作斗争，维护民族独立，才能发展四大洲的科学事业。在我们同各国科学家的接触中，我们发现这一看法是共同的。
    他在讲话中说，在昨天和今天的学术会议上，各国朋友都根据本国科学研究工作的特点作了报告，这使我很感动。他谈到过去参加过许多大的国际学术会议，在那里人们是炫耀个人的科学研究成果，而在这里却充满亲切的、团结合作的气氛。他又说，我们的团结是真诚的，而不是口头上的。
    他表示坚信，这次物理讨论会定将和一九六四年北京科学讨论会一样，取得巨大成就。
    出席招待会作陪的，有各部门的负责人韩光、郝德青、刘子载和中国科学家代表团的全体成员。
    招待会始终洋溢着团结友好的气氛，席间中外科学家进行了亲切的交谈。各国科学家频频举杯共祝亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、大洋洲各国人民和科学家的团结日益加强。
    招待会后，各国科学家观看了中国人民解放军海军政治部文工团演出的话剧《赤道战鼓》。
