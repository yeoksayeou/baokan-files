The Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Youth League on July 19 wrote a letter to all members of the labor youth league and young men and women throughout the country, calling on them to resolutely respond to Chairman Ho's great battle call with concrete actions, to advance bravely, and to defeat the American aggressors.

The letter said, "Uncle Ho's words most vividly and profoundly reflect the iron will and determination of the Vietnamese people and youth to persist in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation until complete victory." The letter said, "We will never be slaves to the American aggressors, and we are willing to sacrifice everything to defeat them, until there is not a single American aggressor left on our land."

The letter from the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Youth League said, "In response to the sacred call for national salvation from our country, the Party, and Uncle Ho, all our cadres, league members, and youth are determined to devote all our strength, wisdom, and perseverance, and our entire youth, to the independence and freedom of our motherland."

The letter said, "For a long time, out of deep hatred for the American aggressors, we have been eagerly waiting to join the army, to take up arms, and to fight against the enemy for national salvation. We warmly welcome Uncle Ho's mobilization order and report to Uncle Ho: We have made all preparations. We are waiting for the Party and Uncle Ho's orders to go to any place where the motherland needs us, to defeat the American aggressors."

The Hanoi City People's Self-Defense Force held a grand award ceremony on the evening of July 19 to warmly commend and reward the outstanding units and heroes who emerged in the battle against American aggressor planes bombing Hanoi.

The conference passed a resolution to the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, pledging: The 100,000 armed self-defense forces in the capital Hanoi will warmly respond to and resolutely carry out Chairman Ho's great battle call, fight bravely, produce actively, display the invincible might of the people's war, turn the heroic capital into a steel fortress, and make the American aggressors suffer heavy losses!

Since the American aggressor planes began continuous bombing of Hanoi on June 29, the entire city of Hanoi has become a city of soldiers. Together with the people's army air defense forces, they have fearlessly fought and sacrificed, dealing heavy blows to the American aggressors, shooting down more than ten American planes, and capturing a large number of American air pirates.

The conference warmly praised many outstanding combat units. For example, a self-defense team on the 13th construction site bravely fought against the enemy planes while rushing into dangerous areas to extinguish fires and rescue national property. A female machine gun team from the Viet Hung commune in Gia Lam County, despite American bombs exploding just seven or eight meters away, burying them in sand, still stood up, encouraged each other, shouted battle slogans, and bravely fired at the enemy planes. In Mei Lin Commune, Dong Ying County, female self-defense soldier Nguyen Thi Khanh used her body as a machine gun stand, allowing her comrades to hit the enemy planes more fiercely and accurately. Another female self-defense soldier, Huang Thi Phuong, was injured in the abdomen by shrapnel, but she remained unyielding and continued to encourage her comrades to fight on, annihilating the American air pirates!

Many self-defense units and individuals who actively supported the air defense forces in combat and achieved outstanding results were also warmly praised at this conference.

Leaders of the Hanoi Municipal Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Municipal Administrative Committee, as well as commanders of the Capital Garrison Command, spoke at the conference. They encouraged all self-defense forces in the capital to resolutely implement Chairman Ho's great call, fight bravely with all the people and soldiers of Vietnam, produce actively, overcome all difficulties, and achieve complete victory in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation.

    新华社河内二十一日电　越南劳动青年团中央委员会十九日写信给全国劳动青年团员和男女青年，号召他们坚决以实际行动响应胡主席的伟大战斗号召，奋勇前进，战胜美国侵略强盗。
    信中说，胡伯伯的话最集中、最深刻地体现了越南人民和青年坚持抗美救国斗争到彻底胜利的钢铁意志和决心。信中说：“我们誓死不愿做美国强盗的奴隶，不惜牺牲一切来打败它，直到在我国的土地上永远没有一个美国侵略者为止。”
    越南劳动青年团中央委员会的信说，为了响应祖国、党和胡伯伯的神圣救国号召，我们全体干部、团员和青年决心把自己的全部力量、智慧和毅力，把自己的整个青春，献给祖国的独立和自由。
    信中说，“很久以来，由于对美国强盗的万分仇恨，我们一直盼望着入伍，拿起枪来杀敌救国。我们热烈欢迎胡伯伯的动员令，并向胡伯伯报告：我们已经作好了一切准备。我们正等待着党和胡伯伯的命令，到祖国需要的任何地方去，以战胜美国强盗。”
    新华社河内二十一日电越南民主共和国首都河内市的民兵自卫队代表十九日晚隆重举行授奖大会，热烈表彰和奖励在反击美国强盗飞机轰炸河内的战斗中涌现出来的大批优秀单位和英雄人物。
    大会通过的给越南劳动党中央和胡志明主席的决心书保证：武装起来的河内市成十万民兵自卫队员热烈响应和坚决执行胡主席的伟大战斗号召，英勇战斗，积极生产，发扬人民战争的无敌威力，把英雄首都变成钢铁的战斗堡垒，让美国侵略强盗碰得头破血流！
    从六月二十九日美国强盗飞机连续轰炸河内以来，河内市全民皆兵，他们同人民军防空部队一起，不怕艰苦牺牲，英勇战斗，给了美国侵略强盗以沉重打击，先后共击落美国飞机十多架，并活捉一大批美国飞贼。
    这次会议热烈表扬了许多优秀的战斗单位。如第十三号工地上的一支自卫队，在敌机轰炸下，一面英勇战斗，一面奋不顾身地冲进危险的地区，扑灭火焰，抢救国家财产。嘉林县越兴乡民兵的一个女机枪小组，尽管美国的炸弹就在距离组员们七、八米的地方爆炸，沙土把她们掩埋了，但是，她们仍然顽强地站起来，互相鼓舞，高呼战斗口号，英勇地向敌机射击。东英县梅林乡女民兵阮氏顽用自己的身体当重机枪的枪架，让战友们更狠、更准地打击敌机，另一位女民兵黄氏芳被弹片打伤了腹部，但是她顽强不屈，仍然坚定地鼓励她的战友们继续战斗，消灭美国空中强盗！
    许多积极支援防空部队战斗而荣立战功的民兵自卫队单位和个人，也受到了这次大会的热烈表扬。
    越南劳动党河内市委员会和市行政委员会的负责人，以及首都卫戍司令部的指挥员，在大会上讲了话。他们勉励首都全体民兵自卫队员，坚决实现胡主席的伟大号召，同全越南军民一起，更加英勇地战斗，积极生产，克服一切困难，彻底打败美国侵略强盗，争取抗美救国斗争的完全胜利。
