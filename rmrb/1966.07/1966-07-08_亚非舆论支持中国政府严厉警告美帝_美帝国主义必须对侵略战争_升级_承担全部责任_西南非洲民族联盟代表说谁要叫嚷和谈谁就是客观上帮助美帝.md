The Asian and African public opinion supports the Chinese government's severe warning to US imperialism. US imperialism must bear full responsibility for the escalation of the aggression war. A representative of the South West Africa People's Organization said that whoever shouts for peace talks is objectively helping US imperialism.

	NEW DELHI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian newspaper "Motherland" commented on July 5 on the statement issued by China on July 3, saying: "The People's Republic of China has once again solemnly declared: If US imperialism insists on escalating its aggression, China is already prepared for war. China means what it says."

	The commentary pointed out: "This statement is of great significance." The commentary said: "If a war breaks out between China and US imperialism, then US imperialism must bear full responsibility."

	The commentary said: "If US imperialism insists on gradually escalating, it will inevitably clash with the People's Republic of China. At that time, the imperialists will not be able to escape."

	DAR ES SALAAM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Enkobo, the treasurer of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa), said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency here that he welcomes the Chinese government's strongest condemnation of US imperialism's bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong issued on July 3.

	Enkobo said that the Chinese government has clearly stated that China is prepared, and once the war starts, there will be no boundaries. He said, "We welcome the timely warning issued by the People's Republic of China against US imperialism's gradual escalation of the aggression war."

	He said that China's warning is beneficial to the people of the world and world peace.

	CAIRO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A representative of the South West Africa People's Organization, M. Kajiunga, issued a statement in Cairo on the current situation of the Vietnamese people's struggle against US aggression for national salvation. The statement said: "Whoever shouts for peace talks is objectively helping US imperialism."

	The statement said: "Peace in Vietnam is not possible and will not be achieved by begging US imperialism or yielding to Johnson's so-called peace talks, but by clearly, firmly, and resolutely supporting the heroic Vietnamese people to drive the US butchers out of their country."

	The statement emphasized: "At this decisive stage of fighting against US imperialism, one must not waver, shout for so-called peace talks, or capitulate to US imperialism in humiliation, but must make the greatest and most resolute determination to defeat US imperialism."
