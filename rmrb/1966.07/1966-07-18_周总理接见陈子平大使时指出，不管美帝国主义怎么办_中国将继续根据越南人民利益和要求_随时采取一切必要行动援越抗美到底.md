	Premier Zhou Enlaid, during his meeting with Ambassador Chen Ziping, stated that regardless of what the U.S. imperialists do, China will continue to act in accordance with the interests and demands of the Vietnamese people, and will take all necessary actions to support Vietnam in its struggle against the U.S. to the very end.

	Despite the efforts of U.S. imperialists, reactionaries from various countries, and modern revisionists to slander and instigate discord between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, the course of history has determined that the peoples of China and Vietnam will stand together, fight together, and achieve victory together. This is an inevitable trend in historical development, beyond the control of human will.

	Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China met with Chen Ziping, the Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, this afternoon.

	Ambassador Chen Ziping presented Premier Zhou Enlai with a copy of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Nation," dated July 17th.

	Ambassador Chen Ziping stated that the Vietnamese people will not yield to enemy threats. The people of North and South Vietnam will deliver heavier blows to the enemy and shatter the U.S. imperialists' plot to force Vietnam to surrender through war threats. The Vietnamese people will overcome all difficulties and make any sacrifice necessary to carry the struggle against the U.S. and for national liberation to the end.

	On behalf of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Vietnamese people, Ambassador Chen Ziping expressed gratitude to the Communist Party of China, the Government of China, and the Chinese people for their unwavering, timely, powerful, and effective support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S. and for national liberation. Ambassador Chen Ziping pointed out that the Communist Party of China is a great and glorious party of Marxism-Leninism, the Chinese people are a great people armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and China is a thoroughly revolutionary country. With the support of 700 million Chinese people and the people of all socialist countries, the Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S. and for national liberation will surely achieve final victory.

	Premier Zhou Enlai thanked Ambassador Chen Ziping for delivering Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Nation" and expressed warm praise and support for the firm resolve of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and all the Vietnamese people to carry the struggle against the U.S. and for national liberation to final victory.

	Premier Zhou Enlai said, "China and Vietnam are two socialist countries that are as closely related as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. In the struggle against imperialism, our two peoples have always sympathized with and supported each other. At present, it is the great struggle of the Vietnamese people against the U.S. and for national liberation that supports us. It is the sacred internationalist duty of the Chinese people to fully support the Vietnamese people. Regardless of what the U.S. imperialists do, China will continue to act in accordance with the interests and demands of the Vietnamese people, and will take all necessary actions at any time to support the great struggle of the Vietnamese people until final victory."

	In discussing the revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam, Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that despite the efforts of U.S. imperialists, reactionaries from various countries, and modern revisionists to slander and instigate discord between our two peoples, the course of history has determined that our two peoples will stand together, fight together, and achieve victory together. This is an inevitable trend in historical development, beyond the control of human will.

	Premier Zhou Enlai expressed his belief that, under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the 31 million Vietnamese people, through resolute struggle and making any sacrifice necessary, will surely achieve final victory.
