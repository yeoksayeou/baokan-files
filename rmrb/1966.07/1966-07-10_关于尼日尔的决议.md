	Resolution on Niger
	1. In view of the mutual support that has existed and will continue to exist among the peoples of Asia and Africa, the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers held in Beijing from June 27 to July 9, 1966, supports the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of Asia and Africa against their common enemy, American imperialism. The conference resolutely and actively supports the people of Niger under the leadership of the Sawaba Party. For the past two years, this party has taken up its historical responsibility, launched armed actions to end compromise and concessions, smashed the reactionary rule of French neocolonialism, and struggled for democracy, freedom, and genuine independence.

	The conference strongly condemns the savage and brutal massacres carried out by the puppet regime of Boubou-Hama-Diori-Zaramba, manipulated today by American imperialism, West Germany, and Israeli fascists, against unarmed Nigerien writers, intellectuals, workers, and peasants. The conference calls on all participating countries to provide political and moral support to the heroic people of Niger in their struggle, and to tirelessly acclaim their daily victories on the battlefield and in politics. The conference exposes and condemns the bloody repression and atrocities committed by the domestic reactionaries under the protection of their imperialist masters.

	2. The conference exposes and condemns the apartheid system and the intolerable, illegal regime of Ian Smith, which has for many years subjected the majority of our African brothers to concentration camps and barbaric, bloody torture.

	3. The conference gives firm support to the peoples of Congo (Leopoldville), Cameroon, Azania, Zimbabwe, "French" Somaliland, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and Southwest Africa.

    关于尼日尔的决议
    一、鉴于亚非各国人民之间的支持过去是、今后一贯也是相互的，一九六六年六月二十七日至七月九日在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议支持越南人民和亚非人民反对他们的共同敌人——美帝国主义的共同斗争。会议坚决地、积极地支持在萨瓦巴党领导下的尼日尔人民。这个党两年以来在历史面前承担了自己的责任，采取了武装行动，以结束妥协让步、粉碎法国新殖民主义的反动统治、争取民主自由和真正的独立。
    会议严厉谴责法国殖民主义一手制造的、今天由美帝国主义、西德和以色列法西斯分子所操纵的布布——迪奥里——强巴拉傀儡政权对手无寸铁的尼日尔作家、知识分子、工人和农民所进行的疯狂残暴的屠杀。会议还要求全体参加会议的国家在政治上和道义上援助正在进行斗争的英勇的尼日尔人民，不倦地欢呼他们在战场上和政治上每日每时所取得的胜利。会议揭露并谴责国内反动派在其主子帝国主义的庇护下对人民进行的一切血腥镇压和暴行。
    二、会议揭露并谴责种族隔离和令人不能容忍的、非法的伊恩·史密斯政权，它多年来使我们大多数非洲兄弟在集中营里、在野蛮血腥的酷刑下呻吟。
    三、会议特别对刚果（利）、喀麦隆、阿扎尼亚、津巴布韦、“法属”索马里海岸、安哥拉、几内亚（比绍）、莫三鼻给、西南非等人民给予坚决的支持。
