Most of Shandong Province's cotton crops are growing well, with some early-planted cotton already beginning to bud.

This year, during the cotton planting period, many areas in Shandong Province experienced droughts. To ensure timely planting, various levels of party committees organized large numbers of cadres to go deep into the grassroots, establish work points, and organize the masses to study Chairman Mao's works. After extensively studying articles such as "Quitting Mount Lu" and "Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," the broad masses of commune members resolved to rely on the collective strength of the people's communes, make full use of water resources, and create moisture for planting. In some areas severely affected by drought, water was carried to plant the seeds, and in some places, seedlings were transplanted to improve the planting quality. According to reports from relevant departments, this year, about 80% of the cotton fields in various places have achieved full coverage.

    山东大部棉花长势很好
    山东省棉花大部分长势很好，有些早播的棉花已开始现蕾。
    今年，山东省棉花播种期间，不少地区遇到了干旱，为了适时完成播种计划，各级党委组织大批干部深入基层蹲点，组织群众大学毛主席著作。广大社员反复学习《愚公移山》、《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》等文章以后，下定决心，不靠天、不等雨，依靠人民公社集体力量，充分利用水源，造墒播种。有些干旱特别严重的地区都挑水点播，有些地方还采用芽苗移栽的方法，提高播种质量。据有关部门检查，今年各地百分之八十左右的棉田达到了基本全苗。
