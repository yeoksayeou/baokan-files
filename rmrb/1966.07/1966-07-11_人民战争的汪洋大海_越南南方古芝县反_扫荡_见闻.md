The people's guerrilla warfare, from the perspective of the entire revolutionary war, is the left and right hand of the main force of the Red Army. Without the people's guerrilla warfare, the main force of the Red Army is like a one-armed general. The conditions of the base areas, specifically speaking, especially for combat, are the armed people. The enemy regards this as a formidable obstacle, mainly because of this point.

The Sea of People's War—Observations of the Counter-"Sweeping" in Ancient Chi County, South Vietnam

    Xú Huái Zhōng, Cóng Shēn

After returning from South Vietnam, many comrades asked us, "How do the military and people of South Vietnam fight so beautifully? They have defeated more than twenty million American troops and fifty to sixty million puppet troops, making them disoriented and in chaos. How do they fight?"

We spent a short time in the south, visited few places, and know little. However, we would like to tell everyone: the narrow strip of land in South Vietnam on the map cannot be viewed with ordinary geographical eyes. No, that is not an ordinary piece of subtropical land, but a vast sea of waves, a sea that can drown the enemy!

We experienced a magnificent counter-"sweeping" in the Chi County base area on the outskirts of Saigon. Chi County is just a small part of the vast sea in the entire south. Here, we record the roaring waves and the splashes we heard and saw in this small corner.

The Steel Blade Stirring in the Enemy's Heart

If the situation of surrounding the countryside with the city in the south is compared to countless ropes binding a giant beast, then the Chi County base area is like a steel blade inserted into the beast's heart. This base area is too close to the center of American puppet rule, Saigon. The people of Chi County can ride bicycles to Saigon to buy things after breakfast and return in time for lunch. The people of Chi County feel more urgent about liberating Saigon than anyone else. They say, "It's only thirty kilometers to Saigon!"

Not only is the strategic position of the Chi County base area enough to cause the enemy great trouble, but this steel blade has been stirring in the enemy's heart all along. The Liberation Army and guerrilla forces, using Chi County and other base areas as a foothold, frequently appear in the suburbs of Saigon to harass and attack the enemy, even inserting the blade tip into the city. The police cars in Saigon are on duty twenty-four hours a day, and military police and secret agents patrol the streets, but they cannot prevent the continuous bombing of the American puppet headquarters, officers' quarters, and pilots' buildings.

The Chi County base area is on the left bank of the Saigon River, cutting off the enemy's waterway, and on the right side, it controls the enemy's main artery, Highway No. 1. The people's armed forces in Chi County, in cooperation with the people in the suburbs of Saigon, tightly surround the enemy's large and small strongholds. Many strongholds have become prisons for the enemy. As soon as the puppet soldiers in the bunkers show their heads, the guerrilla's bullets will fly over. Some bunkers, the enemy has to wrap their feces in paper and throw them out of the wall. Some bunkers have no water wells, and the puppet soldiers have to ask the guerrillas for permission to fetch water: "Comrade Viet Cong! Can we go out to fetch some water?" Some bunkers, the enemy cannot get a haircut, and everyone's hair grows frighteningly long. Old women mock them, saying, "You should be like women, using clips to tie up your hair." Their superiors send supplies to each stronghold once a month, and each time they have to send out a battalion or more, with air and artillery cover, to deliver the supplies.

For several years, the enemy has tried every means to eradicate this fatal steel blade. American advisors have led the puppet army to "sweep" the base area many times, but each time they come in with good intentions and leave in disarray. Last May, the puppet army sent out two regiments. As soon as they entered the base area, they lost a regiment headquarters and a whole battalion, and the rest fled in defeat. A fleeing American advisor encountered the scattered puppet soldiers and mistook them for "Viet Cong" pursuing them, hurriedly throwing down his gun and surrendering to the puppet soldiers, making the puppet soldiers laugh and cry, saying, "Advisor, we are also running for our lives!" Since that "sweeping," for more than eight months, the enemy has not dared to enter the base area. The servant is no good, so the master has to take action. Now the American army has come in person.

The More the Enemy Struggles, the More Fierce They Are

The enemy struggles more desperately, the more fierce they become. The Chi County base area is triangular, with the longest side only about twenty kilometers, but suddenly seven thousand American troops were sent in, with more than two hundred aircraft, one hundred and fifty cannons, six hundred military vehicles, armored vehicles, and tanks.

One morning, as we were brushing our teeth, the tight drumming of the American "sweeping" began. First, B-52 "strategic bombers" bombed heavily, followed by various tactical bombers bombing indiscriminately, and then the cannons around the base area all fired into the base area. We stood in the shelter and looked out, seeing planes covering the sky with smoke and dust, and the sound of bombs, gasoline bombs, rockets, and artillery shells exploding mixed with the roar and strafing of enemy planes.

"American devils want to scare us with planes and cannons, we are not afraid! We only have hatred! The more the enemy bombs, the greater our hatred!" This is the heart-rending voice of an old peasant woman. This voice drowned out the roar of the enemy planes and cannons!

Hatred! The people of Chi County are all embodiments of hatred! On this land, they fought for nine years and defeated the French bandits who killed and burned. On this land, there were once countless execution machines of the American running dog Ngo Dinh Diem, and the people of Chi County shed rivers of blood. The farmers in every village built "hatred monuments," carving the names of all the men, women, children, and infants in the village who were killed on the monuments and in their hearts! At the same time, they took up bamboo spears, machetes, and bows and arrows, and all the simple weapons they could find to fight to the death with the enemy. For years, American imperialism has bombed and shelled Chi County day and night, and every crater, every ruined house, and every scorched tree is a new "hatred monument"! A platoon leader, Nguyen Thang, told us that his wife and children were all killed by American shells, and looking at the white jade ring his wife gave him when they got married, he said to us, "I have no sadness, only hatred! We are all victims of American imperialist aggression, and my family is one of them. This national hatred and family grudge must be avenged!"

Now, the American devils have come, the enemy of the people of Chi County has come, the enemy of the Vietnamese people has come, the enemy of the people of the world has come! "In this world, there is either them or us!" The men, women, old, and young living in the "hatred monument" village, all those who can hold weapons have taken up weapons!

In the few hours when the planes and cannons were rampant, the people hid in their fortifications with weapons in hand, waiting for the enemy to come. Houses were destroyed, villages turned into ruins, and the young women of the farming families, Six Sister, looked at the thick smoke in front of her and said, "Let them bomb! Bomb the old ones, and we will build new ones!" The orange groves were blown up, and the precious durian trees were uprooted. The owners did not care, they did not want anything, they only wanted the enemy's lives!

After a long period of artillery preparation, seven thousand American troops landed in the rear of the base area in helicopters and armored vehicles. The time for the people of Chi County to take revenge and for the fighting villages to show their strength had finally come.

The people of Chi County are highly organized. Under the unified leadership of the Party organization, each village is a strong fighting collective. The fighting villages are long-term constructions, with various fortifications above and below ground, inside and outside the village, like a spider's web. The American invaders arrogantly called the first phase of the "sweeping" the "scorched earth march." Scorched earth they can create with a million dollars, but "marching" is not something that can be exchanged with dollars. They have to pay a price in blood for every step they take. As soon as the American troops landed, revenge bullets and grenades rained down on them, and wherever they went, there were people shooting. Every village fights, everyone fights; experienced guerrilla fighters fight, ordinary people who have never held a gun also fight; men fight, women also fight; young and strong fight, old people and children also fight. There are not enough guns, everyone fights for them, takes turns, and those who cannot find weapons carry ammunition, treat the wounded, and do laundry and cook for those who are directly fighting... The old women voluntarily organized the "anti-American rice ball team," letting those who hold guns eat sweet and filling rice balls to kill more enemies. Tens of thousands of Chi County people have only one thought: fight! fight! fight!

A young woman who had never participated in battle, Nguyen Thi Nhi, asked for a landmine and buried it under the caterpillar track of an American tank in the parking lot. The tank was destroyed as soon as it moved. With this achievement, she confidently received a rifle and consecutively killed sixteen American soldiers, becoming an excellent anti-American hero. A primary school teacher, Nguyen Van Vinh, asked for a gun, but he was not given one because he was too weak and was only allowed to be a medic. A guerrilla fighter was injured, and he immediately picked up the injured person's gun and consecutively killed seven enemies. This weak scholar also became a second-class anti-American hero. A nurse, Nguyen Thi Cam, followed a guerrilla fighter to help press bullets. The fighter consecutively killed many enemies and was too tired to hold the gun. He took the opportunity to take the gun and continue to fight, killing seven American soldiers with fourteen bullets. Later, he regretfully told us, "I have never shot a gun, my aim is poor, and one devil rolled on the ground. I used four bullets to kill him."

There was a girl whose bullets ran out, and she went to her father to "borrow" some. Her father said, "I only have thirty bullets left. If I give them to you, what will I use to fight?" Unable to bear her daughter's nagging, he reluctantly gave her fifteen bullets. How many such moving stories there are!

In the first three days of the counter-"sweeping," because there were too many enemies, the command center temporarily could not contact each village, and in the absence of unified command, each village still annihilated a large number of enemies. Sometimes the fighting groups within the same village lost contact with each other, but a small group still fought independently, and a person also fought independently! Each village fights on its own, and each person fights on their own!

Guerrilla Warfare Shines

The American devils have nothing but rely on planes and cannons to show off, but this trick is completely ineffective against the local armed forces and guerrilla forces in Chi County. The dispersed troops and guerrilla groups mix with the enemy, eat, sleep, and fight near the enemy, making it impossible for planes and cannons to operate. The American army also relies on its numbers, pushing and shoving everywhere, rushing into villages to find guerrillas. This is exactly what the guerrilla fighters want. A guerrilla fighter, Nguyen Van Na, said, "When the enemy comes to our village to fight, it is more convenient for us. Even if we cover our eyes, we know where it is bright and where it is dark, where we can hide and shoot, and where we can retreat after shooting. We can walk anywhere on the ground, and everywhere is connected underground. We can fight fiercely, and if it is not good, we can find a place to rest and then continue." These words are well said. This is determined by the people's war and is unchangeable. What can the American invaders do?

As soon as the American soldiers hear gunshots, they immediately want to form a battle array to prepare for combat, but with whom to fight? Where to counterattack? They don't know. Where are the "Viet Cong"? They are everywhere, but no one has seen them. Thousands of radios and walkie-talkies shout all day, thousands of binoculars look all day, and thousands of military maps are checked all day, but to what avail? They cannot change the situation of being blind and deaf to both people and terrain.

The guerrilla fighters fully exploit their own advantages of being sharp-eyed and brave, and everywhere they seize the weaknesses of the American soldiers' deafness, blindness, and cowardice; every tree, every bamboo grove, every ditch, and every crater is a good place to shoot. The American soldiers are shot at on the road and dare not hide in the trees by the roadside, because the map does not indicate where there are spike traps and landmines.

There are landmines on the ground and in the air. Nguyen Van Na saw American soldiers gathering in an open field, and he climbed to the top of a tree by the field and hung a landmine made by a local factory. As soon as a group of American soldiers stood in formation, he connected the wire on the side, killing and injuring dozens of them. The landmine took to the air, this is the guerrilla's "tactical bomber," and its power is even greater than the American "strategic bomber."

Let me tell another story of combining landmine warfare and trench warfare. A platoon of American soldiers searched forward along the road to De Co Commune, and suddenly a gunshot rang out, killing an American soldier. The American officer in charge was stunned and hurriedly asked the interpreter, "Where was the gunshot?" The interpreter stammered, "I... I don't know!" In fact, the muzzle was right under their feet, coming from a trench shooting hole hidden in the grass. The southern comrades call this trench shooting hole a fighting point. There was a three-person guerrilla group in this fighting point, and coincidentally, one of them understood English. He heard the enemy still discussing the source of the bullet and fired three more shots. The enemy then dragged four corpses away in a panic and fled back the way they came. However, it is easier to come than to go. The guerrilla small group had already quickly run out of the trench to the road and buried a landmine, waiting for the enemy to be most concentrated before igniting it, killing another thirty or so.

At night, it is the people's war. On the Korean battlefield, a captured American officer once complained about the volunteer army's night raids, saying that they did not follow the "rest time" set by God. The Vietnamese people also do not care about the "rest time" set by God. On the first night the American soldiers stayed in the temple village, the guerrilla commander Nguyen Hong Duy hugged a landmine and placed it under the American tent, destroying twelve tents and letting thirty-six American soldiers rest forever according to "God's time."

The first phase of the counter-"sweeping" lasted eleven days. In just eleven days, the people of Chi County annihilated more than 1,600 American soldiers, including 1,300 killed! There was no major battle, just a few killed here and a few dozen killed there, eating a few bites today and a few bites tomorrow, it was a guerrilla war blooming everywhere! The enemy was annihilated by 1,600, but the casualties of the guerrilla forces and the army were only twenty-one, with a death ratio of 100 to 1!

The Decisive Factor is People

Chairman Mao said, "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." This unshakable truth is particularly evident in the people of Chi County's counter-"sweeping" battle.

If we put the single-shot rifles used by the people of Chi County together with the machine guns, rapid-fire rifles, and 203mm cannons used by the American army, and the homemade landmines and grenades with half-ton bombs, the difference is not too great? However, there is another way to compare. We asked the guerrilla commander of De Co Commune, Phan Van Canh, "Which has more power, your grenade or the American bomb?" He replied very frankly, "The American bomb explodes in our forest, and my grenade explodes in the American crowd!" This is both an obvious fact and a profound philosophy. Let the world hear the bold voice of this guerrilla commander!

Phan Van Canh, this twenty-five-year-old rubber plantation worker, before this counter-"sweeping," had used grenades, rifles, and homemade guns to annihilate fifty-four fully equipped puppet soldiers, and during this counter-"sweeping," he created a record of annihilating 124 American soldiers with grenades, rifles, and landmines! Zero to one hundred and seventy-eight.

Why do the advantages and disadvantages of weapons and the victories and defeats of battles form an inverse proportion? The words of a female guerrilla fighter, Nguyen Thi Nhi, reveal the fundamental reason: "We have revolutionary ideals, so our weapons have targets; the enemy soldiers do not know why they are fighting, so their weapons naturally have no targets." Yes, Phan Van Canh and Nguyen Thi Nhi are people with revolutionary ideals, people with class consciousness, people who can see both the immediate and distant targets.

Phan Van Canh said, "I am fighting for the class, I am fighting for the people, so I am not afraid of sacrifice. If I sacrifice myself, our class lives, our people live, and the people will have a good life in the future. It is glorious to sacrifice oneself for this goal!" It is precisely because of such a lofty ideal and ambitious spirit that Phan Van Canh and his comrades-in-arms produce the tremendous power to overcome all enemies!

People with lofty revolutionary ideals are fearless. A brave man known as Ren Ge, in the dead of night, sneaked into the enemy's lair alone, crossing five barbed wire fences and minefields, and sneaked into the American command post. Unfortunately, he stepped on a flare mine, and the enemy fired at him fiercely, but he was fearless, using a submachine gun and grenades to kill the enemy in turn. He was seriously injured but still bravely supported his body, firing the last few bullets and throwing the last grenade. Seeing the fifty-fourth American soldier fall, Ren Ge closed his eyes!

Look at the American soldiers, each one is as timid as a mouse, and life is everything. As soon as they hear gunshots, men in their twenties and thirties cry! The people of Chi County have heard this unpleasant crying too many times. The guerrilla commander Nguyen Hong Duy shot at a group of American soldiers resting in a big temple, and as soon as he killed one, the rest started crying. Some cried while shooting wildly, and some cried while making the sign of the cross on their chests. We asked Nguyen Hong Duy, "How many people did you see crying at that time?" He laughed happily, "I can't count! Almost all of them cried! The crying was so loud, woo—woo—wa—wa, it almost drowned out the sound of the enemy planes!" Remember: this is the crying of the first infantry division of the United States, which has a history of more than one hundred years! If Nguyen Hong Duy had brought a tape recorder, recorded this crying on the spot, and made it into a record, it would be very interesting. One side could be the "crazy symphony" of American planes and cannons, and the other side could be the "mixed chorus of weeping" of the American invaders.

For the American soldiers who regard life as their "ideal," any hardship is unbearable. They cannot live without helicopters, and food, water, and clothes to change must be delivered by helicopters on time. Even crossing a rice field, they have to call a helicopter to pick them up. The American soldiers are also strangely afraid of heat. When living in a wilderness camp, they use water pumps to pump river water onto the tents, and also transport a large amount of ice blocks from the city to put in buckets. People squat in them, and even so, more than thirty people died of heat!

The fear and despair of the American soldiers increased rapidly with the number of casualties. Many people tore up photos of their relatives and letters from home and deserted back to Saigon. Some would rather be imprisoned and sentenced to heavy penalties than go to the front line.

The fighting spirit of the people of Chi County became more vigorous with each victory. In the second and third phases of the counter-"sweeping," the American army was concentrated in the small area of the southern half of the base area. The villages in the south fought, and the villages in the north also rushed to the "anti-American area" to fight. The leadership had to divide the "anti-American area" into several small sections and assign them to various units. However, if a small section did not encounter American soldiers for a day, they would shout, "We are idle here, let's swap!" Everyone wanted to be an "anti-American hero," and "anti-American heroes" emerged in large numbers.

It is these innocent and lovely young men, slender girls, middle-aged men with calloused hands, and old men chewing betel nuts who scare the tall and strong, well-equipped American devils, making them tremble all over and cry in pain! It is these ordinary workers and peasants who, when fighting, are worth several, several dozen, several hundred people. Because they have an invincible spiritual weapon!

When we reluctantly left South Vietnam, the counter-"sweeping" battle of the people of Chi County was still raging. The enemy originally thought that after a few days of "scorched earth march," they could "victoriously end" this "sweeping," but the people of Chi County firmly held them back and fought them to a standstill. The first infantry division of the American army was injured and frightened, and the surviving ones were so scared that they lost their souls. They could not hold on any longer and had to bring in several thousand soldiers from the American 25th Infantry Division to be cannon fodder in Chi County. The people of Chi County were very happy. They not only achieved a great victory of annihilating thousands of enemies but also tied down a large number of American soldiers for a long time, making the enemy unable to withdraw their legs and sink deeper and deeper. This is another great victory. Tying down the American army can continue to eat them bit by bit; tying down the American army is equivalent to reducing a large number of American mobile forces, strongly supporting other battlefields, and strongly supporting the mobile operations of the powerful main force of the Liberation Army.

In more than twenty million American troops invading Vietnam, only a few tens of thousands of troops can be mobilized in the southern battlefield. However, a small Chi County has tied down nearly ten thousand of them! No wonder the commander of the American troops invading Vietnam, Westmoreland, was in a hurry and called for an increase in troops to four hundred thousand. In fact, five hundred thousand or six hundred thousand would not be enough. How many tens of thousands of American troops can fill an ocean of surging waves?

American imperialism is sinking deeper and deeper in the south, and the southern people are fighting stronger and stronger.

The people of Chi County have directly confronted the American invaders for the first time this year. Previously, they had no experience. After a few months of confrontation, they have thoroughly understood the temperament and nature of American imperialism. At the victory celebration, an anti-American hero said, "In the past, I heard people say that Chairman Mao said that American imperialism is a paper tiger, and I did not quite understand what it meant. This time, after a confrontation with the Americans, I understood, and the saying of a paper tiger is the most appropriate!" Another anti-American hero said, "American imperialism is really not scary. As long as you dare to fight and know how to fight, you can fight with any weapon, any terrain, and any weather!" This is the personal experience of the people of Chi County, this is the personal experience of the Vietnamese people. All those who live under the gun of American imperialism, all those who groan under the iron hoof of American imperialism, learn from the precious experience of the Vietnamese people, and take up any weapon you can get and fight!

    人民的游击战争，从整个革命战争的观点看来，和主力红军是互为左右手，只有主力红军而无人民的游击战争，就象一个独臂将军。根据地的人民条件，具体地说来，特别是对于作战说来，就是有武装起来了的人民。敌人视为畏途，主要地也在这一点。

　　人民战争的汪洋大海
　　——越南南方古芝县反“扫荡”见闻
　　徐怀中　丛深
    我们从越南南方回来以后，很多同志问我们：“越南南方军民怎么打得那样漂亮？把二十多万美军，还有五六十万伪军打得晕头转向，一塌糊涂，究竟是怎样打的呢？”我们在南方访问的时间很短，走的地方很少，知道的东西太少。不过，我们想告诉大家：地图上越南南方那个狭长的地带，不能用普通的地理眼光去看它，不，那不是一块普通的亚热带土地，而是一片波浪滔天的汪洋大海，是“陷敌于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海”啊！
    我们曾经在西贡外围的古芝县根据地里经历过一次轰轰烈烈的反“扫荡”。古芝，只不过是全南方汪洋大海的一个小小的组成部分，这里就记述一下，我们在这个小角落里听见的奔腾呼号的海啸声，和看见的一些浪花吧。
  钢刀在敌人心腹中搅动
    如果把南方农村包围城市的形势比作无数条绳索捆住一只巨大的野兽，那么，古芝根据地就象插进野兽心腹里的一把钢刀。这块根据地距离美伪统治中心西贡市实在太近了，根据地的人吃过早饭，骑自行车去西贡买东西，可以从从容容赶回来吃午饭。古芝人对于解放西贡比任何人的感觉都要迫近，他们说：“离西贡只有三十公里了！”
    单是古芝根据地所处的战略位置，已经足以构成敌人的心腹大患了，又何况这把钢刀一直在敌人心腹里搅动呢。解放军和游击队以古芝及其它根据地为依托，经常出现在西贡市郊骚扰与打击敌人，甚至把刀尖一直插进市内去。西贡市内警备车一天二十四小时不敢灭火，军警特务遍街巡察，却无法防止美伪首脑机关和军官宿舍、飞行员大楼连续被炸。
    古芝根据地左靠西贡河，切断了敌人的航道，右侧又扼住了敌人的大动脉一号公路。古芝的人民武装，还配合西贡郊区人民紧紧地包围了敌人的大小据点，很多据点完全变成囚禁敌人的监狱。碉堡里伪军稍一露头，游击队的子弹就会立即飞去。有的碉堡，敌人大便要用纸包上扔到墙外来。有的碉堡里没有水井，伪军每次打水要先请示游击队：“越共先生！我们出去打点水行不行？”有的碉堡敌人不能理发，个个头发长得吓人，老大娘嘲笑他们说：“你们应该象女人那样，弄些卡子把头发卡上。”他们上司每月派人给各据点送一次粮饷，每次都要出动一个营以上兵力，还要有飞机大炮的掩护，才能送到。
    几年来敌人千方百计地企图拔除这把致命的钢刀，美军顾问督率伪军多次进根据地“扫荡”，但每次都是有好来没好去。去年五月伪军出动两个团，刚进根据地就被吃掉一个团部和一个整营，其余的大败而逃，一个落荒而逃的美军顾问，迎面遇上跑散了的伪军，误以为是“越共”来追击，急忙扔下枪向伪军举手投降，弄得伪军啼笑皆非地说：“顾问先生！我们也是逃命的！”从那次“扫荡”以后，八个多月的长时间里敌人再没敢走进根据地一步。奴才不行了，只好主子亲自出马，现在美军亲自来了。
  村村是战场　人人是战士
    敌人越是垂死挣扎，就越疯狂。古芝根据地是三角形的，最长一边不过二十几公里，竟然一下子投进来七千多美军，出动二百多架飞机，一百五十多门大炮，六百多辆军用车、装甲车和坦克。
    一天早晨，我们正在刷牙，美军“扫荡”前的紧锣密鼓敲起来了。先是B—52型“战略轰炸机”狂轰，接着是各种战术轰炸机滥炸，然后是周围各据点的大炮一齐向根据地里乱打。我们站在掩蔽部里向外看，只见飞机漫天烟尘盖地，炸弹、汽油弹、火箭、炮弹的爆炸声和敌机嘶吼与扫射声混成一片。
      “美国鬼子想用飞机大炮吓住我们，我们不会害怕！我们只有仇恨！敌人炸得越凶我们的仇恨越大！”这是一位农民老大娘的震撼人心的声音。这声音盖过敌人飞机大炮的吼叫！
    仇恨！古芝人民人人都是仇恨的化身！在这块土地上，他们曾经血战九年，打败了杀人放火的法国强盗。在这块土地上，曾经遍布美国走狗吴庭艳的杀头机，古芝人民血流成河，农民们在每个村庄都建立起“仇恨碑”，把全村被害的男女老少和婴儿的名字全都刻在碑上，刻在心上！同时，人们拿起竹矛、砍刀和弓箭，拿起一切可以复仇的简陋武器和敌人拚死搏斗。几年来美帝国主义日日夜夜向古芝轰炸打炮，每一个弹坑，每一处房屋废墟，每一棵烧焦的树木都是新增添的“仇恨碑”！一位连指导员阮胜同志告诉我们，他的妻儿老小全被美国炮弹杀害了，他看着手上那只结婚时妻子送的白玉戒指对我们说：“我没有悲伤，只有仇恨！我们全体越南人民都是美帝国主义侵略的受害者，其中也有我的家庭，这国恨家仇是一定要报的！”
    现在，美国鬼子来了，古芝人民的仇敌来了，越南人民的仇敌来了，全世界人民的仇敌来了！“在这个世界上有他们就没有我们！”生活在“仇恨碑”村里的男女老少，凡是能拿动武器的都拿起武器来了！
    在飞机大炮逞凶的几个小时里，人们握紧手中武器隐蔽在工事里，等待敌人前来。房屋炸毁了，村庄变成废墟，农家姑娘六姐望着面前的浓烟说：“让他们炸好啦！炸了旧的我们再盖新的！”桔子林炸烂了，珍贵的流连果树连根拔起，主人们理也不理，他们什么都不想要，只想要敌人的命！
    在长时间的火力准备之后，七千美军坐着直升飞机和装甲车在根据地后方着陆，古芝人民复仇的时刻，战斗村发挥威力的时刻终于来到了。
    古芝人民是高度组织起来的，在党组织的统一领导下，每个村都是一个坚强的战斗集体。战斗村是长期建设起来的，村内村外地上地下各种工事星罗棋布，密如蛛网。美国侵略者把第一阶段“扫荡”狂妄地叫作“焦土行军”，焦土他们是可以用千万美元的代价制造出来的，至于“行军”可就不是美元能换得的了，他们每行一步都要付出血的代价。美军刚一落地，复仇的子弹和手榴弹就劈头盖脑打过来，走到哪里哪里都有人打。村村打，人人打；身经百战的游击队员打，没摸过枪的普通群众也打；男人打，妇女也打；青壮年打，老人和孩子也打。枪不够用，大家抢着打，换着打，摸不到武器的人就运送弹药，救护伤员，为直接参战的人洗衣作饭……老大娘们自动组织起“歼美粽子团”，让拿枪的人吃上香甜耐饿的粽子，好打死更多敌人。几万个古芝人只有一个念头：打！打！打！
    从未参加过战斗的农民姑娘阮文尼，要了一颗地雷，埋到停车场的一辆美国坦克履带下面，坦克一开就炸毁了。凭着这个战绩，她又理直气壮地领到一支步枪，接连打死十六个美军，被评为优秀级歼美勇士。小学教员阮文坞要枪人家不给，说他身体太弱，只许可当救护员，有一个游击组员负了伤，他立即拿起伤员的枪，先后打死七个敌人，这个文弱书生也成为二级歼美勇士。护士阮文禁跟在一个游击组员身后帮忙压子弹，那个组员连续打死很多敌人、累得手拿不稳枪了，他乘机接过枪来继续打，用十四发子弹打死七个美军，事后却不无遗憾地对我们说：“我没打过枪，准头差，有一个鬼子满地乱滚，我费了四粒子弹才把他打死。”
    有一个女孩子，子弹打光了，找父亲去“借”，父亲说：“我就剩下三十发了，给了你我拿什么打？”耐不过女儿的磨缠，只好分十五发给她。有多少这样激动人心的故事啊！
    反“扫荡”开始的头三天，因为敌人太多，指挥部一时无法和各乡各村联系，在失去统一指挥的情况下，各乡各村照样消灭大量敌人。有时同村的各战斗小组之间也失掉联系，但是一个小组也照样独立战斗，一个人也照样独立战斗！村自为战，人自为战！
      游击战大显神通
    美国鬼没别的，就是仗着飞机大炮逞威风，可是，这一套对古芝地方武装和游击队完全失灵。分散部队和游击小组，就和敌人搅在一起，靠近敌人吃、睡、打，弄得飞机大炮没法施展。美军还仗着人多，拥拥挤挤到处乱闯，扑到村子里寻找游击队。这倒正合游击队员们的意思。游击队员阮文纳说：“敌人到我们村来打，我们可就方便多了。我们蒙上眼睛也知道哪里是明处，哪里是暗处，哪里可以隐住身子打枪，打完可以往哪里转移。我们地上随便走，地下处处通，能打只管狠打，看着不行找个地方歇歇再说。美国鬼子呢？从天上掉下来，昏头转向，要射击找不到目标，只能给我们当射击目标。”这话讲得多好。这是人民战争决定了的，永远不可改变的。美国侵略者有什么办法呢？
    美国兵一听枪响，马上就想摆开阵势准备战斗，可是跟谁战斗？向哪里还击？不知道。哪里有“越共”？哪里都有，但是谁也没看见。成千部电台和步谈机整天在喊，成千架望远镜整天在看，成千张军用地图整天在查，但是有什么用，他们根本无法改变人地两生、又聋又瞎的窘境。
    游击队员们充分发挥自己耳聪眼明和勇敢灵活的特长，处处抓住美军耳聋眼瞎和胆小笨拙的弱点；每一棵树，每一丛竹，每一道田埂，每一个弹坑，都是打冷枪的好地方。美军走在路上挨了打，都不敢钻进路边树林里去隐蔽，因为地图上没有标明什么地方有尖桩陷阱和地雷。
    地面有地雷，空中也有地雷。阮文纳看见美军要到一个空场上集合，他爬到空场边的树头挂上一个乡兵工厂造的地雷，一连美军刚站好队，他在旁边一接电线，炸死炸伤好几十个。地雷升空，这是游击队的“战术轰炸机”，它比美国的“战略轰炸机”威力还大哩。
    再说一个地雷战和地道战相结合的故事吧。有一连美军沿路向德协乡搜索前进，忽然一声枪响，一个美军倒毙，带队的美国军官怔住了，急忙问翻译：“哪里打枪？”翻译战战兢兢地说：“我……我也不知道！”其实枪口就在他们脚下，是隐蔽在草丛中的一个地道射击口里打出来的，南方同志把这种地道射击口叫作战斗点。这个战斗点里有个三人游击组，恰巧其中有一个人懂英语，听见敌人还在讨论子弹发源地问题，又连打三枪，敌人这才拖上四具死尸慌乱地向来路逃跑。但是来时容易去时难，游击小组已经敏捷地从地道里跑到路上，埋上了一个地雷，单等敌人最密集的时候才接火，又给报销了三十多个。
    夜间更是人民战争的天下了。在朝鲜战场上，一个被俘的美国军官曾经抱怨志愿军的夜袭，说是“不遵守上帝规定的休息时间”，越南人民也是不理会上帝规定的。美军住在庙村的第一个夜晚，游击队长阮红决就抱一个地雷，放在美军帐篷脚下，一下子炸毁十二架帐篷，让三十六个美军按照“上帝规定的时间”永远休息了。
    反“扫荡”第一阶段历时十一天，在短短的十一天里，古芝人民消灭了一千六百多美军！其中打死一千三！没有什么大战斗，就是这里打死几个，那里炸死几十，今天吃几口，明天吃几口，就是遍地开花的游击战！歼敌一千六，游击队加上部队的伤亡总数却是二十一人，敌我死亡比例是一百比一！
      决定的因素是人
    毛主席说：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”这一颠扑不破的真理，在古芝人民反“扫荡”战斗中显露得格外鲜明。
    如果把古芝人民使用的单发步枪跟美军使用的机关枪、高速冲锋枪和二○三口径的大炮放在一起，把土造地雷、手榴弹跟半吨重的大炸弹放在一起，相比之下不是相差得太悬殊吗？但是，也还有另外一种比法。我们问德协乡游击队长潘文根：“你的手榴弹和美国的炸弹比起来哪个威力大？”他很干脆地回答说：“美国的炸弹在我们的树林里爆炸，我的手榴弹在美军的人群里爆炸！”说得真好啊！这既是显而易见的事实，又是寓意深长的哲理，让全世界都听听这位游击队长豪迈的声音吧！
    潘文根，这个二十五岁的橡胶园工人，在这次反“扫荡”以前，曾经用手榴弹、步枪和土枪消灭过五十四个全副美械装备的伪军，在这次反“扫荡”期间他又用手榴弹、步枪和地雷创造了一个人消灭一百二十四个美军的光辉纪录！零比一百七十八。
    为什么武器的优劣和战斗的胜败形成反比例？女游击队员阮氏妮的一句话，道出最根本的原因：“我们有革命理想，所以武器有目标；敌人士兵不知道为什么打仗，武器自然也就没有目标。”是的，潘文根和阮氏妮他们是有革命理想的人，是有阶级觉悟的人，是既能看清眼前目标又能看清远大目标的人。
    潘文根说：“我是为阶级而战的，我是为人民而战的，所以我不怕牺牲。个人牺牲了，我们的阶级活着，我们的人民活着，人民将来能过好日子，为这个目标牺牲个人是光荣的！”正因为怀有这样的崇高理想和凌云壮志，才使得潘文根和他的战友们产生压倒一切敌人的巨大力量！
    有崇高的革命理想的人是无所畏惧的。一个大家称为仁哥的勇士，深夜里只身深入虎穴，越过五道铁丝网和布雷区，摸进美军指挥所。不幸踩中一个照明地雷，敌人向他猛烈的射击，但他毫无惧色，轮番用冲锋枪和手榴弹杀伤敌人。他负了重伤，仍然顽强地支撑着身体，打完最后的几粒子弹，投出最后的一颗手榴弹，看见第五十四个美军倒下去，仁哥才闭上眼睛！
    再看看美军吧，一个个胆小如鼠，活命就是一切。一听见枪声，二三十岁的汉子哇哇哭！这难听的哭声，古芝人民听得太多了。游击队长阮红决，向休息在大庙里的一群美军打冷枪，刚打死一个，其余的就哭起来。有的一边哭一边乱打枪，有的一边哭一边在胸前划十字。我们问阮红决同志：“你当时看见有多少人哭？”他开心地笑着说：“数不过来！差不多都哭！哭声很大，乌——乌——哇——哇，简直要盖过敌人飞机的声音了！”要知道：这是具有一百多年历史的美国王牌军第一步兵师的哭声啊！如果阮红决他们带一台录音机，把这哭声当场录下音来该多有意思，可以制成这样一张唱片，这一面是美国飞机大炮的“疯狂大合奏”，另一面是美国侵略军的“混声大合哭”。
    对于活命就是“理想”的美军来说，任何一点艰苦也都是无法忍受的。他们离了直升飞机就不能活，吃饭、喝水和换洗的衣服都要由直升飞机按时送来，就是穿越一片稻田，也要叫直升飞机来接运。美军怕热也怕得出奇，住在野外营地，要用抽水机抽河水在帐篷上浇，还从城里运来大量的冰块装在桶里，人蹲进去，就这样还热死三十多人哩！
    美军的恐惧与绝望情绪随着死伤人数而迅速增长，许多人撕碎亲人的照片，撕碎家信，开小差逃回西贡去了。有的宁肯坐牢，被判重刑，就是不上前线。
    古芝人民的斗志则随着胜利而日益旺盛。反“扫荡”的第二、第三阶段，美军麕集在根据地南半部的狭小地区，南部各乡各村打，北部的各乡各村也都争着抢着到那个
  “打美地区”去打，领导上只好把“打美地区”划成若干小段，分给各单位。但是有的小段一天打不上美军，就叫喊了：“在这里闲着我们不干，跟他们换换！”人人争当“歼美勇士”，“歼美勇士”大量涌现出来。
    就是这些天真可爱的小伙子，身材瘦小的姑娘，满手厚茧的中年人，还有嚼着槟榔的老人，就是他们把那些身高体胖、武器精良的美国佬吓得浑身发抖，打得叫苦连天！就是这些普普通通的工人农民，打起仗来一个人顶几个人、几十个人、几百个人。因为他们有威力无穷的精神武器！
    当我们依依不舍地离开越南南方的时候，古芝人民的反“扫荡”战斗还正在激烈地进行着。敌人原想经过几天“焦土行军”就可以“胜利结束”这场“扫荡”，但古芝人民硬是拖住他们，打得他们收不了场。美军第一步兵师死伤累累，活着的也被吓得丢魂丧胆，实在支持不住了，不得不换来美军第二十五步兵师的几千人，住在古芝当替死鬼。古芝人民太高兴了，他们不但取得了歼敌数千的巨大胜利，而且长期拖住了大批美军，使得敌人拔不出腿去，越陷越深，这又是一个巨大的胜利。拖住美军就可以继续一口一口地吃下去；拖住美军就等于减掉一大批美军的机动兵力，有力地支援其它战场，有力地支援强大的解放军主力部队的机动作战。
    二十多万侵越美军中，能够抽出来在南方战场机动作战的只有几万兵力，而一个小小的古芝就拖住了将近一万人！难怪侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰火烧火燎地叫喊，要求增兵到四十万人。其实五十万六十万也不够开销，多少万美军才能填满一个怒涛滚滚的汪洋大海呢？
    美帝国主义在南方越陷越深，南方人民越战越强。
    古芝人民今年是初次和美国侵略军直接交锋，以前没有经验，经过几个月的较量，把美帝国主义的脾气禀性摸透了。在庆功大会上，一位歼美勇士说：“过去听人讲，毛主席说美帝国主义是纸老虎，我还不大懂得是什么意思，这回和美国人一交手，我懂得了，纸老虎这个说法再好不过了！”另一位歼美勇士说：“美帝国主义实在没有什么可怕，只要你敢打、会打，什么武器也能打，什么地形也能打，什么天气也能打！”这是古芝人民的切身经验，这是越南人民的切身经验，一切生活在美帝国主义炮口下的人们，一切呻吟在美帝国主义铁蹄下的人们，记取越南人民宝贵的经验，拿起你能够拿到的任何武器战斗吧！

    每一棵树，每一丛竹，每一道田埂，每一个弹坑，都是打冷枪的好地方。
    从未参加过战斗的农民姑娘阮文尼，要了一颗地雷，埋到停车场的一辆美国坦克履带下面，坦克一开就炸毁了。
