Recently, over fifty small hydropower stations (including waterwheel pump stations capable of generating electricity) in the rural areas of Hainan Liang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Guangdong Province have started generating electricity and releasing water. This has enabled a number of Liang and Miao households to use electric lights for illumination and to use electric power to operate machinery for threshing, milling rice, and pressing sugar. Large tracts of arid farmland have also received irrigation.

During the construction of these small hydropower stations, the broad masses of Liang and Miao community members have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully embodying the spirit of self-reliance. The Changhao Brigade of Changhao Commune in Baoting County, located in the Wuzhishan area, emphasized politics during the socialist education movement. Brigade cadres and community members studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, determined to take the road of self-reliance, raising funds and materials on their own. As a result, they spent very little money to build a small hydropower station, allowing all households in the brigade, as well as the commune's offices and schools, to use electric lights. It also provided power for a small sugar mill and a rice mill.

    海南黎族苗族自治州新建一批水电站
    广东省海南黎族苗族自治州农村，最近又有五十多座小型水电站（包括可以发电的水轮泵站）发电放水，使一批黎族苗族农户开始用电灯照明，用电力带动机器打谷、碾米、榨糖，大片干旱耕地获得了灌溉。
    在建设小型水电站过程中，广大黎族苗族社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，充分发扬了自力更生的精神。地处五指山区的保亭县畅好公社畅好大队，在社会主义教育运动中，大队的干部和社员突出政治，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，决心走自力更生道路，自己筹集资金、材料。结果花了很少的钱，就办起一座小型水电站，使全队农户、公社机关和学校可以用电灯照明，还给一座小糖厂和碾米厂提供了动力。
