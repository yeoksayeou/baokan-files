It is an art of Marxism-Leninism to be good at turning the Party's policies into actions of the masses, to be good at making every one of our movements and every one of our struggles understood not only by the leading cadres but also by the broad masses, so that they can all grasp them. The boundary of whether our work makes mistakes or not lies here.

    毛主席语录
    善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。我们的工作犯不犯错误，其界限也在这里。
