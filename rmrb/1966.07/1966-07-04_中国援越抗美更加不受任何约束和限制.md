The Chinese government issued a statement strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' brazen and continuous bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.

Since the boundaries have been broken by the United States, the Vietnamese people are no longer bound by any constraints. All countries and peoples that truly support the Vietnamese people's anti-American war are also no longer bound by any constraints. How the war will proceed next is no longer up to the Americans. If the U.S. imperialists come from the air and the sea, why can't others come from the land?

	New China News Agency, July 3rd: The government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on the 3rd, expressing extreme indignation and the strongest condemnation of the U.S. imperialists' brazen and continuous bombing of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the second-largest city, Haiphong.

	The statement points out that the U.S. imperialists have long since completely destroyed the Geneva Agreement and have long since broken the boundaries between South and North Vietnam. Now, they are bombing the capital of the heroic Vietnamese people, further breaking the boundaries between South and North Vietnam. All serious consequences arising from this must be borne by the United States.

	The statement says that China has always, unconditionally, and to the utmost of its ability, supported Vietnam politically, morally, materially, and in other ways. Now, due to the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression reaching a new and more serious stage, our support and aid to Vietnam have become even more unrestrained and unconstrained. We will, according to the interests and requirements of the Vietnamese people, take whatever actions we deem necessary at any time.

	The statement reaffirms the statements made by the Chinese government and Premier Zhou Enlai on many solemn occasions: the Chinese people keep their word, China is prepared, and if the war breaks out, there will be no boundaries. The statement says that we must warn the U.S. imperialists that no matter where they want to expand the war, no matter what the cost, we will firmly support our Vietnamese brothers to the end, until we drive the U.S. aggressors completely and thoroughly out of Vietnam and achieve final victory. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China

	July 3, 1966

	Starting on June 29, 1966, the U.S. imperialists brazenly and continuously bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the second-largest city, Haiphong. The Chinese government and people express extreme indignation and the strongest condemnation of this savage, crazy, criminal act of aggression and war by the U.S. imperialists.

	Since the U.S. imperialists first bombed North Vietnam, they have started a full-scale war of aggression against the 31 million people of Vietnam. Now, the U.S. imperialists have brought the war to the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, escalating this war of aggression to a new and more serious stage.

	The U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi does not show their strength but their weakness, showing that they are at their wits' end in their war of aggression against Vietnam. Johnson's order to bomb Hanoi reflects the U.S. imperialists' desperate internal and external situation, a sign of a cornered dog jumping over a wall.

	The U.S. imperialists attempt to use the bombing of Hanoi to intimidate the Vietnamese people into surrendering and accepting their "peace talks" deception. The U.S. imperialists' wishful thinking is to use bombing to force "peace," permanently occupying South Vietnam, using South Vietnam as a base to invade North Vietnam, the entire Indochina, China, and the entire Asia. This is all a pipe dream. All the heroic Vietnamese people, whether in the South or the North, on the ground or in the air, have continuously given the U.S. imperialists heavy blows, which is a powerful response to the U.S. bandits.

	In the situation where the U.S. imperialists refuse to completely withdraw their troops of aggression and are escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam, anyone, in any form, trying to peddle "peace talks" on the Vietnam issue, even colluding with the U.S. behind the scenes, is betraying the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and serving the U.S. imperialists.

	The U.S. imperialists have long since completely destroyed the Geneva Agreement and have long since broken the boundaries between South and North Vietnam. Now, they are bombing the capital of the heroic Vietnamese people, further breaking the boundaries between South and North Vietnam. All serious consequences arising from this must be borne by the United States.

	Since the boundaries have been broken by the United States, the Vietnamese people are no longer bound by any constraints. All countries and peoples that truly support the Vietnamese people's anti-American war are also no longer bound by any constraints. How the war will proceed next is no longer up to the Americans. If the U.S. imperialists come from the air and the sea, why can't others come from the land?

	All 31 million people of Vietnam taking all measures to defend their motherland are just. The support of the North Vietnamese people for the South Vietnamese people is a sacred right of the Vietnamese people.

	Internationally, all countries and peoples that truly oppose U.S. imperialism taking all measures to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression are just. They can at any time take actions they deem most effective to support the Vietnamese people, which is completely their sacred right.

	The Chinese government and people firmly support the statement issued by the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's Foreign Ministry on June 30th. The Chinese government and people firmly support the just call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh representing the Vietnamese government and people. Chairman Ho Chi Minh said on December 8, 1965: "Vietnam is one country, the Vietnamese nation is one entity. As flesh-and-blood compatriots, the northern people will wholeheartedly support the anti-American patriotic struggle of the southern compatriots, just as the southern people wholeheartedly contribute to the defense of their northern motherland." He also said, "We will not surrender to the U.S. imperialists' aggression," "Our people are determined to fight on, endure sacrifices, for ten years, twenty years, or even longer, until we achieve complete victory."

	China and Vietnam are neighboring countries that depend on each other like lips and teeth, the closest socialist fraternal countries. China has always, unconditionally, and to the utmost of its ability, supported Vietnam politically, morally, materially, and in other ways. Now, due to the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression reaching a new and more serious stage, our support and aid to Vietnam have become even more unrestrained and unconstrained. We will, according to the interests and requirements of the Vietnamese people, take whatever actions we deem necessary at any time. This is our unshirkable proletarian internationalist duty.

	The Chinese government and Premier Zhou Enlai have repeatedly solemnly declared that the Chinese people keep their word, China is prepared, and if the war breaks out, there will be no boundaries. We must warn the U.S. imperialists that no matter where they want to expand the war, no matter what the cost, we will firmly support our Vietnamese brothers to the end, until we drive the U.S. aggressors completely and thoroughly out of Vietnam and achieve final victory.

	The U.S. imperialists will surely be defeated, and the Vietnamese people will surely be victorious!

    我国政府发表声明最强烈谴责美帝悍然连续轰炸河内海防
    中国援越抗美更加不受任何约束和限制
    界限既然被美国打破了，越南人民就不受任何约束了，一切真正支持越南人民抗美战争的国家和人民，也就不受任何约束了。战争下一步怎样打法，就由不得美国了。美帝国主义既然从空中来，从海上来，难道别人就不能从陆上去吗？
    新华社三日讯　中华人民共和国政府三日发表声明，对美帝国主义悍然连续轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市和第二大城市海防市，表示无比的愤怒和最强烈的谴责。
    声明指出，美帝国主义早已彻底破坏了日内瓦协议，早已打破越南南方和北方之间的界限。现在，它轰炸英雄的越南人民的首都，这就进一步打破了越南南方和北方的界限。由此而产生的一切严重后果，都必须由美国承担。
    声明说，中国从来一贯地、无保留地、尽一切可能从政治上、道义上、物质上并且从其他方面给予越南以支持和援助。现在，由于美帝国主义侵略战争发展到了一个新的更加严重的阶段，使我们的这种支持和援助，更加不受任何约束和限制。我们将根据越南人民的利益，根据越南人民的要求，随时采取我们认为必要的行动。
    声明重申了中国政府和周恩来总理多次郑重发表的声明：中国人民说了话是算数的，中国是作了准备的，战争打起来就没有界限了。声明说，我们要正告美帝国主义者，不管你们要把战争扩大到什么地方，不管要付出多大的代价，我们都将坚定不移地支持兄弟的越南人民打到底，直到把美国侵略者全部彻底赶出越南，取得最后胜利。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府声明
    一九六六年七月三日
    一九六六年六月二十九日开始，美帝国主义悍然连续轰炸了越南民主共和国的首都河内市和第二大城市海防市。对于美帝国主义这种野蛮的疯狂的犯罪的侵略和战争行动，中国政府和中国人民表示无比的愤怒和最强烈的谴责。
    从美帝国主义第一次轰炸越南北方以后，就开始了对越南三千一百万人民的全面的侵略战争。现在美帝国主义把战火烧到越南民主共和国的首都，使这个侵略战争上升到一个新的更严重的阶段。
    美帝国主义轰炸河内的行动，并不说明它强大，而说明它虚弱，说明它在侵略越南的战争中已经走投无路。约翰逊下令轰炸河内，反映了美帝国主义内外交困的窘境，是一种狗急跳墙的表现。
    美帝国主义企图用轰炸河内来胁迫越南人民屈服，接受它的“和谈”骗局。美帝国主义的如意算盘是“以炸迫和”，让它永远占领越南南方，把越南南方作为它侵略越南北方，侵略整个印度支那，侵略中国，侵略整个亚洲的基地。这完全是梦想。全体的英雄的越南人民，不管南方和北方，在地面上，在空中，不断给美帝国主义以沉重的打击，就是对美国强盗的强有力的回答。
    在美帝国主义拒绝全部彻底撤退它的侵略军队，加紧扩大侵略越南战争的情况下，不管什么人，不管采取什么形式，在越南问题上兜售“和平谈判”，甚至同美国搞幕后交易，配合美国实现“以炸迫和”的阴谋，都是出卖越南人民的抗美救国斗争，为美帝国主义效劳。
    美帝国主义早已彻底破坏了日内瓦协议，早已打破越南南方和北方之间的界限。现在，它轰炸英雄的越南人民的首都，这就进一步打破了越南南方和北方的界限。由此而产生的一切严重后果，都必须由美国承担。
    界限既然被美国打破了，越南人民就不受任何约束了，一切真正支持越南人民抗美战争的国家和人民，也就不受任何约束了。战争下一步怎样打法，就由不得美国了。美帝国主义既然从空中来，从海上来，难道别人就不能从陆上去吗？
    全越南三千一百万人民采取一切办法来保卫自己的祖国，都是正义的。越南北方人民对于越南南方的一切支援，都是越南人民的神圣权利。
    国际上一切真正反对美帝国主义的国家和人民，采取一切办法支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，都是正义的。他们可以随时采取自己认为最有效的支援越南人民的行动，这完全是他们的神圣权利。
    中国政府和中国人民坚决支持越南民主共和国外交部六月三十日的声明。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持胡志明主席代表越南政府和越南人民的正义呼声。胡志明主席一九六五年十二月八日说：“越南是一个国家，越南民族是一个整体。作为骨肉的同胞，北方人民一定全心全力支援南方同胞的抗美爱国斗争，正如南方人民全心全力地为保卫自己祖国的北方而作出贡献一样。”他又说：“我们决不屈服于美帝国主义的侵略”，“我国人民决心坚持战斗，忍受牺牲，不管十年、二十年或更长的时间，直到取得完全胜利。”
    中国和越南是唇齿相依的邻邦，是最亲密的社会主义兄弟国家。中国从来一贯地、无保留地、尽一切可能从政治上、道义上、物质上并且从其他方面给予越南以支持和援助。现在，由于美帝国主义侵略战争发展到了一个新的更加严重的阶段，使我们的这种支持和援助，更加不受任何约束和限制。我们将根据越南人民的利益，根据越南人民的要求，随时采取我们认为必要的行动。这是我们无可推卸的无产阶级国际主义义务。
    中国政府和周恩来总理多次郑重声明，中国人民说了话是算数的，中国是作了准备的，战争打起来就没有界限了。我们要正告美帝国主义者，不管你们要把战争扩大到什么地方，不管要付出多大的代价，我们都将坚定不移地支持兄弟的越南人民打到底，直到把美国侵略者全部彻底赶出越南，取得最后胜利。
    美帝国主义必败，越南人民必胜！
