Egyptian Ambassador Hosts National Day Reception
Ambassador Imam and Vice Premier Li Xiannian Mutually Wish for Continued Development of Bilateral Friendship
Vice Premier Li Xiannian Reiterates China's Firm Stance on Supporting Vietnam Against U.S. Aggression

BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) — Egyptian Ambassador to China Adli Imam hosted a reception at the Egyptian Embassy today to celebrate Egypt's National Day.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Yang Mingxuan, and President of the Supreme People's Court Yang Xifeng attended the reception at the invitation.

Ambassador Imam and Vice Premier Li Xiannian both spoke at the reception, expressing their wishes for the continued development of friendship between the peoples of China and Egypt.

In his speech, Vice Premier Li Xiannian emphasized that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's solemn declaration on July 22 once again expressed the Chinese government and people's firm stance in resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national liberation. He said that now, the Chinese people's support and assistance to the Vietnamese people are no longer subject to any restrictions or constraints. He condemned that some international demons are helping the U.S. carry out the conspiracy of "bombing for peace" on the Vietnam issue, further exposing their true faces as henchmen and lackeys of U.S. imperialism.

Ambassador Imam introduced Egypt's achievements in construction and its foreign policy. He said that Egypt insists on African unity and opposes the attempt to establish an Islamic pact because this pact is a religious smokescreen for the conspiracy of colonialism and reactionaries against independence and social development, against the liberation movement and the people who stand up. It is also the root cause of harming and threatening any united action against the common Arab enemy — Israel. Egypt is also committed to the struggle for the liberation of Palestine.

The ambassador said that Egypt supports the self-determination of all peoples. The Egyptian people hope that the wishes and aspirations of the Vietnamese people will be realized. The bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by U.S. aircraft is a very serious matter, causing deep concern and regret.

He said that the relationship between Egypt and the People's Republic of China is continuously advancing. This relationship is based on the principles of friendship, mutual cooperation, and mutual respect guided by the Ten Principles of Bandung and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He hopes that the economic and cultural cooperation between Egypt and China will be further consolidated and strengthened, thereby strengthening Asian-African solidarity.

Ambassador Imam also mentioned President Nasser's speech on July 22 at a mass rally regarding the issue of importing wheat from the U.S. The ambassador said that Egypt will never sell its freedom in exchange for wheat or anything else.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian praised the Egyptian people for their efforts and achievements in opposing imperialism, maintaining national independence, and building the country.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian condemned that some international demons are actively helping the U.S. carry out the grand conspiracy of "bombing for peace" on the Vietnam issue. He pointed out that these demons do not condemn the U.S. for its heinous crimes of expanding aggression in Vietnam but instead, without distinguishing right from wrong, call for "all governments to abandon the use of force." They completely ignore the fact that the U.S. has thoroughly torn up the Geneva Accords, yet still propose to reconvene the Geneva Conference, saying that only within the framework of the Geneva Accords can a solution to the Vietnam issue be found. Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out that any proposal that does not demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops and merely talks about the Geneva Accords is a betrayal of the Vietnamese people and serves the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to occupy South Vietnam and split Vietnam.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that the partial mobilization order issued by the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and his "Letter to All Compatriots" are a great revolutionary action of the Vietnamese people in upholding internationalism and patriotism, fully expressing the Vietnamese people's iron will and confidence in victory to carry the struggle against U.S. aggression for national liberation to the end.

He mentioned Chairman Liu Shaoqi's solemn declaration on July 22, saying that no matter how long or where the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national liberation goes on, the 700 million Chinese people are the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. Now, the Chinese people's support and assistance to the Vietnamese people are no longer subject to any restrictions or constraints. The Chinese people have made up their minds and are fully prepared to take any actions deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam at any time and place, to jointly strike down the U.S. aggressors, to fight on, to fight to the end, and to fight until the final victory.

He said that the struggle of the Vietnamese people powerfully supports the peoples of the Indochina countries, powerfully supports the Chinese people, the Arab people, and all peoples fighting against imperialism and colonialism. The struggle of the Arab people against U.S. imperialism and Zionism also powerfully supports the Chinese people, the Vietnamese people, and all peoples fighting against imperialism and colonialism.

He condemned the recent more brazen actions of U.S. imperialism in arming Israel and supporting Israel's new provocations against Syria. He said that the Chinese people cannot but feel concerned about this. We firmly support the just struggle of the Arab peoples to defend and maintain national independence and to oppose U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel. We firmly support the just struggle of the Palestinian Arab people to restore all their rights in Palestine. This is the unshakable stance of the Chinese government and people.

Also present at the reception were Zhang Zaiwo, Zhang Su, Qi Pengfei, Zhang Zongxun, Lei Renmin, Li Yingji, and other relevant officials.

Ambassadors from various countries to China were also invited to the reception.

    阿联驻华大使举行国庆招待会
    伊马姆大使和李先念副总理互祝两国友谊不断发展
    李先念副总理重申中国人民援越抗美坚定立场
    新华社二十三日讯　阿拉伯联合共和国驻中国大使阿德利·伊马姆，今天下午为阿联国庆在大使馆举行招待会。
    李先念副总理，杨明轩副委员长，最高人民法院院长杨秀峰，应邀出席了招待会。
    伊马姆大使和李先念副总理在招待会上先后讲话，共祝中国和阿联两国人民之间的友谊不断发展。
    李先念副总理在讲话中强调指出，刘少奇主席在二十二日发表的庄严声明，又一次表达了中国政府和中国人民坚决支援越南人民抗美救国斗争的坚定立场。他说，现在中国人民对越南人民的支持和援助，已经不受任何限制和约束了。他谴责说，现在国际上的一些牛鬼蛇神，在越南问题上帮助美国推行“以炸迫和”的阴谋，已进一步暴露了他们充当美帝国主义帮凶和走卒的真面目。
    伊马姆大使在讲话中介绍了阿联在建设中取得的成就和阿联的对外政策。他说，阿联坚持非洲团结，反对建立伊斯兰条约的企图，因为这个条约是殖民主义和反动派阴谋反对独立及社会发展，反对解放运动和站起来的人民的崇高革命目标的一个宗教烟幕，也是危害和威胁任何反对阿拉伯共同敌人——以色列的联合行动的根源。阿联还致力于解放巴勒斯坦的斗争。
    大使说，阿联支持各国人民的自决权。阿联人民期望越南人民的意愿和希望能得以实现。美国飞机对河内和海防的侵犯是一件极端严重的事情，令人感到深切忧虑和十分遗憾。
    他说，阿联与人民中国之间的关系在不断进展，这种关系是建立在万隆十项原则及和平共处五项原则指导下的友好、互相合作、互相尊重的基础上的。他希望阿联和中国之间的经济和文化合作关系进一步巩固和加强，从而加强亚非团结。
    伊马姆大使在讲话中介绍了纳赛尔总统二十二日在一次群众大会上就从美国进口小麦问题谈到的阿联和美国的关系。大使说，阿联绝不出卖自己的自由来换取小麦和任何其他东西。
    李先念副总理在讲话中赞扬阿联人民在反对帝国主义、维护民族独立和建设国家等方面，进行了很多努力，取得了显著的成就。
    李先念副总理谴责国际上的一些牛鬼蛇神纷纷活动，在越南问题上帮助美国推行“以炸迫和”的大阴谋。他指出，这些牛鬼蛇神毫不谴责美国扩大侵略越南的滔天罪行，反而不分是非地呼吁什么“所有的政府放弃使用武力”。他们根本不顾美国早已彻底撕毁日内瓦协议的事实，虽然还提出什么重新召开日内瓦会议的建议，说什么只有在日内瓦协议范围内才能找到解决越南问题的办法。李先念副总理指出，任何不要美国撤军，空谈日内瓦协议的建议，就是对越南人民的出卖，就是为美帝国主义霸占南越、分裂越南的阴谋效劳。
    李先念副总理说，越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席颁布的局部动员令和发表的《告全国同胞书》，是越南人民坚持国际主义和爱国主义的伟大革命行动，充分表达了越南人民决心把抗美救国斗争进行到底的钢铁意志和必胜信心。
    他谈到刘少奇主席二十二日发表的庄严声明时说，不管越南人民抗美救国战争打到什么时候，打到什么地方，七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，中国辽阔的国土是越南人民的可靠后方。现在，中国人民对越南人民的支持和援助，已经不受任何限制和约束了。中国人民下定了决心，做好了各种准备，随时随地采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动，共同打击美国侵略者，打下去，打到底，打到最后胜利。
    他说，越南人民的斗争有力地支持了印度支那各国人民，有力地支持了中国人民、阿拉伯人民和所有反帝反殖的各国人民。阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义和犹太复国主义的斗争，也同样支持了中国人民、越南人民和所有反帝反殖的各国人民。
    他谴责美帝国主义最近更加明目张胆地加紧武装以色列，并且支持以色列对叙利亚进行新的挑衅。他说，中国人民对此不能不感到关切。我们坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民争取和维护民族独立、反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的正义斗争。我们坚决支持巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民恢复他们在巴勒斯坦的一切权利的正义斗争。这是中国政府和中国人民坚定不移的立场。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有张奚若、张苏、姬鹏飞、张宗逊、雷任民、李应吉等有关方面的负责人。
    各国驻中国的使节也应邀出席了招待会。
