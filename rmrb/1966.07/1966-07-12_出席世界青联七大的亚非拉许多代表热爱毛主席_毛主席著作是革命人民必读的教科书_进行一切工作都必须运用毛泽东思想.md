Many Asian, African, and Latin American representatives attending the Seventh World Youth Festival love Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's works are essential reading for revolutionary people. All work must be conducted using Mao Zedong Thought.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Sofia on the 11th, among the representatives from Asian, African, and Latin American countries who participated in the recently concluded Seventh World Youth Festival in Sofia, there was a profound and sincere sentiment of love and respect for Chairman Mao Zedong and praise for Mao Zedong Thought.

Throughout the entire conference, despite the Soviet delegation's efforts to incite anti-China sentiment both inside and outside the venue, attempting to defame China in every possible way, representatives from many Asian, African, and Latin American countries eagerly shook hands with the Chinese youth delegation and enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao Zedong and the People's Republic of China. They also praised the Chinese youth delegation for its firm stance in opposing American imperialism and modern revisionism and for resolutely supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

On June 17th, after the conference closed, the Chinese youth delegation held a film screening to entertain representatives from Asian, African, and Latin American countries. On the spot, many representatives requested Chairman Mao's works from the Chinese representatives. As soon as the Chinese delegation presented Chairman Mao's works, they were quickly taken. People treasured them as precious gems, holding them tightly to their chests and revealing their inner joy. One representative said, "I will take it back to my homeland to study and research it thoroughly."

Many representatives from Asia, Africa, and Latin America highly praised Chairman Mao's works and Mao Zedong Thought. A representative from the "June 14th" Revolutionary Movement in the Dominican Republic said, "In the Dominican Republic, many people study Mao Zedong's works as important revolutionary documents. Mao Zedong's theories are revolutionary theories, fighting theories. Especially Chairman Mao's theories on armed struggle, not only have significant practical implications for the Dominican people but also have important implications for all countries fighting against imperialism and for national liberation." Another representative from the same organization said, "Chairman Mao's assertion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is absolutely correct. The struggle of the Dominican people fully proves this assertion."

A representative from Venezuela said, "The people of our country greatly admire Chairman Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong's works are our essential reading. We not only study Mao Zedong's works for armed struggle but also for all our work, we must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought."

A youth representative from Rwanda said, "The majority of our organization's members greatly love Chairman Mao. We use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon of struggle." When talking about the anti-imperialist struggle, he said, "We must use violence to counter violence, just as the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, said, 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'"

A representative from Zimbabwe said, "I have read many of Chairman Mao Zedong's works. His articles, although discussing Chinese issues, are as if talking about our country's affairs. For countries like ours that have not yet been liberated, Mao Zedong's works have extremely significant implications."

An African youth representative living in a certain Eastern European country said, "In the country where I live, they have already distorted Marxism-Leninism. To study genuine Marxism-Leninism, one must go to China." He also said, "Some people deliberately distort Mao Zedong Thought. I will fight to defend Mao Zedong Thought."

    出席世界青联七大的亚非拉许多代表热爱毛主席
　　毛主席著作是革命人民必读的教科书  进行一切工作都必须运用毛泽东思想
    据新华社索非亚十一日电　在参加不久前在索非亚举行的世界民主青年联盟第七次代表大会的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家代表中间，洋溢着热爱和崇敬毛泽东主席、赞扬毛泽东思想的十分真挚的感情。
    在整个大会期间，尽管苏联代表团在会场内外竭力煽动反华，千方百计地企图诋毁中国，但是，来自亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲许多国家的青年代表们，都争着同中国青年代表亲切握手，热烈赞扬毛泽东主席和人民中国，赞扬中国青年代表团在会上坚持反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义、坚决支持各国人民的革命斗争的原则立场。
    六月十七日，大会闭幕后，中国青年代表团举行电影招待会，招待亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家的青年代表，当场有不少代表向中国代表要毛主席的著作。中国青年代表团一拿出毛主席著作，就被一分而光。人们如获至宝，把它紧紧地抱在怀里，流露出内心的喜悦。一位代表说：“我要把它带回我的祖国去，要好好地学习和研究它”。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的许多代表高度赞扬毛主席的著作和毛泽东思想。多米尼加“六月十四日”革命运动组织的代表说：“在多米尼加，很多人把毛泽东的著作当成重要的革命文献来学习。因为毛泽东的理论是革命的理论，是战斗的理论。特别是毛主席关于武装斗争的理论，不仅对我们多米尼加人民有重大的现实意义，而且对所有正在进行反对帝国主义和争取民族解放斗争的国家都有重要意义。”这个组织的另一位代表说：“毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断非常正确。我们多米尼加人民的斗争实践充分地证明了这一论断。”
    委内瑞拉的一位代表说：“我们国家的人民对毛泽东主席非常敬仰。毛泽东的著作是我们必读的教科书，我们不仅进行武装斗争要学习毛泽东著作，而且进行一切工作都必须学习和运用毛泽东思想。”
    卢旺达一位青年代表说，“我们组织的绝大多数成员都十分热爱毛主席，我们是以毛泽东思想作为斗争武器的。”他在谈到反帝斗争时说，“必须以暴力对付暴力，正象中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席说的那样‘枪杆子里面出政权’。”
    津巴布韦一位代表说，“我读了很多毛泽东主席的著作，他的许多文章讲的虽然是中国的问题，但就象是谈我们国家的事情一样。对我们这些还没有解放的国家来说，毛泽东的著作有着非常重大的意义。”
    一位居住在东欧某个国家的非洲青年代表说：“在我居住的那个国家里，他们已经把马克思列宁主义篡改了。要想学习真正的马克思列宁主义，必须到中国去。”他还说，“有的人故意歪曲毛泽东思想，我要为捍卫毛泽东思想而斗争。”
