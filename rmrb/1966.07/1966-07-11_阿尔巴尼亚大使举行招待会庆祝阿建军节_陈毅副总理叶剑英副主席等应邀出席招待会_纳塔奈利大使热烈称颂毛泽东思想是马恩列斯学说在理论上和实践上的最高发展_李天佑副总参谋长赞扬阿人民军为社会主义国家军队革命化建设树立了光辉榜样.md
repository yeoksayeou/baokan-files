Albanian Ambassador Vasili Nataneli hosted a reception tonight to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Ye Jianying, and Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Li Tianyou and Wang Xinting, along with Deputy Director of the General Political Department Yuan Ziqin, were invited to attend the reception.

Nataneli and Li Tianyou both spoke at the reception, expressing their wishes for the great and unbreakable friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Albania to continue to strengthen and develop.

In his speech, Nataneli recounted the glorious achievements of the Albanian People's Army since its founding. He said that the Albanian People's Army is a powerful weapon of the dictatorship of the proletariat, tasked with smashing the plots and tricks of domestic and foreign enemies, defending and developing revolutionary achievements. The people's army stands ready at all times to defend the motherland from invasion; when necessary, to defend the interests of the socialist revolution, it will fulfill its internationalist duty.

Nataneli condemned the heinous crime of the U.S. imperialists bombing Hanoi and Haiphong in Vietnam, and the betrayal of the Soviet leadership in serving Johnson's peace fraud. He said that the Albanian people and their army have always steadfastly supported the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and believe that, no matter how long or how arduous the struggle of the Vietnamese people, it will ultimately end with the complete defeat of the U.S. imperialist invaders and their lackeys, the Soviet revisionists.

Nataneli enthusiastically praised the great thought of Mao Zedong. He said that the world revolution will continue to advance and will achieve victory because today, the revolutionary peoples, oppressed nations, and oppressed peoples of the world have a powerful weapon against imperialism and revisionism—the thought of Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong thought is the highest development of the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, both in theory and practice.

The ambassador said that there is an eternal, unbreakable friendship between the peoples and armies of Albania and China. In recent years, this deep friendship has been further strengthened. Under the leadership of Enver Hoxha and Mao Zedong, the peoples and armies of the two countries have raised high the banner of revolution, fighting to maintain the purity of Marxism-Leninism and to oppose the imperialist aggressors led by the United States and the modern revisionists represented by the Soviet leadership.

Li Tianyou, on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended the warmest holiday greetings to all the officers and soldiers of the Albanian People's Army. He praised the Albanian People's Army and the entire people for their great achievements in resisting imperialist aggression and modern revisionist subversion and sabotage, in defending the independence and security of their motherland. He said that the facts have proven that the Albanian people are indeed heroic, and the Albanian People's Army is indeed a heroic army.

Li Tianyou said that the Albanian People's Army is a highly conscious proletarian army, armed with Marxism-Leninism. Especially this year, the Albanian People's Army has resolutely implemented the major measures proposed by the Albanian Party of Labor to strengthen revolutionary construction, and the entire army has shown a new revolutionary spirit and high morale. The Albanian People's Army adheres to the revolutionary line of building the army, firmly defends the dictatorship of the proletariat, not only for the defense of their socialist motherland and the defense of European and world peace, but also sets a brilliant example for the revolutionary construction of the army in socialist countries.

Li Tianyou, in his speech, expressed great indignation at the recent crazy aggression of the U.S. imperialists bombing Hanoi and Haiphong in Vietnam, and condemned the reactionary policy and traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist clique in the Vietnamese issue. He said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army firmly supports the statement of our government on July 3. Since the U.S. imperialists have broken the boundaries of expanding the war in Vietnam, our support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation also has no boundaries. We, together with the heroic Albanian people and the peoples of the world, firmly support our Vietnamese brothers to fight to the end, until all American invaders are driven out of Vietnam and achieve final victory.

Li Tianyou said that the peoples and armies of China and Albania have a great friendship and unity in struggle. We are firmly convinced that in the future, no matter what storms and waves appear on the road of revolution, our two peoples and armies will always stand together, fighting side by side for our common ideals, against the imperialists led by the United States and their running dogs, and the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet leadership, and marching forward to the end.

Tonight, those who attended the reception also included Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Xiuquan, Wang Bingnan, and various departments, military branches, and relevant personnel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, such as Zhang Tianyun, Wu Faxian, Du Yide, Liu Shaowen, Xiang Shouzhi, Tan Youlin, Luo Huasheng, and Pan Zhenwu.

    新华社十日讯　阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使瓦西里·纳塔奈利今晚举行招待会，庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军二十三周年。
    国务院副总理陈毅，国防委员会副主席叶剑英，中国人民解放军副总参谋长李天佑、王新亭，总政治部副主任袁子钦等应邀出席了招待会。
    纳塔奈利大使和李天佑副总参谋长先后在招待会上讲了话。共祝中阿两国人民和两国军队之间牢不可破的伟大的战斗友谊日益巩固和发展。
    纳塔奈利大使在讲话中，叙述了阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军以来取得的辉煌成就。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民军是无产阶级专政的强大武器，它有着粉碎国内外敌人的阴谋诡计、保卫和发展革命成果的使命。人民军时刻严阵以待，保卫祖国免受侵犯；一旦需要，为了保卫社会主义革命的利益，它将履行自己的国际主义义务。
    纳塔奈利大使谴责美帝国主义悍然轰炸越南河内和海防的滔天罪行；谴责苏共领导集团背叛越南人民为约翰逊的和谈骗局效劳。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民及其人民军始终不渝地支持越南人民的正义斗争，并且相信，越南人民的斗争，不管持续多久，多么艰苦，必将以美帝国主义侵略者及其奴仆苏联修正主义者的彻底失败而告终。
    纳塔奈利大使热烈称颂伟大的毛泽东思想。他说，世界革命必将继续前进，必将取得胜利，因为今天世界上各国革命人民、被压迫民族和被压迫人民掌握着反对帝国主义和修正主义的强大武器——毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说在理论上和实践上的最高发展。
    大使说，阿中两国人民和两国军队之间有着永恒的、牢不可破的友谊。近年来，这种深厚的友谊得到了进一步的增强。两国人民和两国军队在以恩维尔·霍查同志和以毛泽东主席为首的两个马克思列宁主义政党的教育下，高举着鲜明的革命旗帜，为维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性、为反对以美国为首的帝国主义侵略者和以苏共领导为代表的现代修正主义者而斗争。
    李天佑副总参谋长在招待会上代表中国人民解放军全体指战员，向阿尔巴尼亚人民军全体指战员表示最热烈的节日祝贺。他赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民军和全国人民一道，在抗击帝国主义侵略、现代修正主义的颠覆和破坏的斗争中，为保卫祖国的独立和安全，取得了伟大的成就。他说，事实证明，阿尔巴尼亚人民不愧为英雄的人民，阿尔巴尼亚人民军不愧为英雄的人民军队。
    李天佑说，阿尔巴尼亚人民军是一支有着高度无产阶级觉悟的军队，是一支用马克思列宁主义武装起来的军队，特别是今年以来，阿尔巴尼亚人民军坚决地贯彻了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党提出的加强革命化建设的重大措施，全军出现了精神焕发、斗志昂扬的一派革命新气象。阿尔巴尼亚人民军坚持革命化建军路线，坚定地维护无产阶级专政，不仅对于保卫自己的社会主义祖国、保卫欧洲和世界和平有着深远的意义，而且为社会主义国家在军队革命化建设上，树立了一个光辉榜样。
    李天佑在讲话中对美帝国主义最近轰炸越南河内和海防的疯狂侵略罪行，表示极大的愤慨，并谴责苏联修正主义集团在越南问题上假支持、真出卖的反动政策和叛徒嘴脸。他说，中国人民解放军坚决拥护我国政府七月三日的声明。美帝国主义既然打破了扩大侵越战争的界限，我们支援越南人民抗美救国斗争也就没有界限。我们同英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民一道，同世界各国人民一道，坚定不移地支持兄弟的越南人民打到底，直到把美帝国主义侵略者全部赶出越南，取得最后胜利。
    李天佑说，中阿两国人民、两国军队，有着伟大的战斗友谊和团结。我们坚信，今后，在前进的革命道路上，不管出现什么惊涛骇浪，我们两国人民和军队都将永远团结在一起，为实现我们共同理想、为反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的共同斗争，并肩前进，战斗到底。
    今晚出席招待会的，还有外交部副部长伍修权、王炳南以及中国人民解放军各总部，各军种、兵种和有关方面负责人张天云、吴法宪、杜义德、刘少文、向守志、谭友林、罗华生、潘振武等。
