The People's Army Newspaper of Vietnam denounces the various "peace talks" fallacies serving the U.S. imperialists in the Vietnam issue. It emphasizes that opposing aggression cannot be a matter of bargaining. Advocating "peace talks" is aiding the U.S. imperialists.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, July 23rd - The People's Army Newspaper of Vietnam published an editorial on the 19th, condemning various "peace talks" fallacies serving the U.S. imperialists in the Vietnam issue.

The article points out that in the political life of the world, the Vietnam War issue is at the center. Regarding the resolution of the Vietnam War, fundamentally, there are three main viewpoints:

(1) The U.S. authorities repeatedly say that they "hope for peaceful discussions," "hope to end the war," and that "the key to peace is in the hands of Hanoi."

(2) Others who claim to be "very concerned about the Vietnam issue" emphasize the need to "hold meetings for discussions." They believe that "Hanoi should sit at the negotiating table to show its peaceful intentions."

(3) Our people have repeatedly clarified their stance. Chairman Hu in his recent "Letter to the Nation" again stressed: "The U.S. must stop its aggression against Vietnam and withdraw all U.S. troops and their mercenaries from Vietnam. Then peace will be immediately restored. Vietnam's stance is clear: This is the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. There is no other way!"

The article analyzes these viewpoints.

After listing numerous facts of U.S. President Johnson's manipulation of "peace talks" plots, the article points out that the so-called "peace" and "discussions" advocated by the U.S. government are essentially aimed at achieving the goal of invading Vietnam in every possible way. The U.S. stance is to use force to compel the Vietnamese people to surrender, engage in negotiations, and accept its intentions. Its intention is to prolong the U.S. military occupation of the South, to force the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to lay down their arms and surrender, and to make the Vietnamese people accept the new colonialist regime of the U.S. in the South.

The article points out that those who claim to be "very concerned about the Vietnam issue" are vigorously advocating "peace talks." Their proposed procedures are as follows: The U.S. "stops bombing" North Vietnam; convene a "peace talks meeting"; discuss the "ceasefire" issue; discuss the issue of "withdrawing foreign troops"; exchange views on "solving internal political issues."

The article says, at first glance, it seems to be a completely different attitude from that of the U.S. Is it really so? No! The U.S. blatantly attacks the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which is a blatant invasion of an independent and sovereign state. The U.S. crimes must be punished. The U.S. must stop bombing the North, and it must do so immediately, unconditionally, and permanently. There is no room for "bargaining" or "concessions."

The article points out that raising the issue of negotiating with the U.S. and demanding that the people of South Vietnam discuss a "ceasefire" with the U.S. while the U.S. stubbornly refuses all the sacred basic national rights of the Vietnamese people, intensifies its aggression against Vietnam, and relentlessly uses military pressure, is encouraging the U.S. aggressors to be more aggressive. The U.S. launched an invasion of Vietnam, so why not force the U.S. to stop its evil actions, but instead discuss it?

The article says, what does discussing the issue of "withdrawing foreign troops" mean? Who is the only foreign troop currently in the South? It is clear that only the U.S. expeditionary forces and their mercenaries are the "foreign troops" that must be withdrawn. The U.S. government withdraws its troops from South Vietnam and destroys military bases, and the war will immediately stop. If the U.S. does not do this, and if it continues to hold meetings and discussions with it, is it not acknowledging that the U.S. invasion of Vietnam is justified? The above peace talks arguments are basically the same as the U.S.'s cunning "peace talks" arguments.

The article says, the Vietnamese people resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression, defending the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of the Vietnamese homeland. The four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of the South, fully reflected in Chairman Hu's recent "Letter to the Nation," are an unshakable stance. The Vietnamese people will resolutely defend their sacred national rights, no matter what sacrifices they have to make. The Vietnamese people will also resolutely defend them. This is a matter of principle that cannot be bargained over. The argument that the Vietnamese people are too "hardline" is aimed at creating political pressure, attempting to force our people to retreat and abandon their legitimate national rights. This is obviously aiding the U.S. aggressors.

The article concludes by saying that the U.S. imperialists are currently intensifying their war of aggression to an extremely fierce level. The U.S.'s false peace talks are nothing but a cover for its mad "escalation" actions. Facing the aggressors' actions, the Vietnamese people have only one path: resolutely resist the aggression to the end. As long as there is one U.S. invader on Vietnamese soil, we will fight. This is the unshakable resolve of the entire Vietnamese people.

### 越南《人民军队报》痛斥为美帝效劳的“和谈”谬论  反对侵略不能讨价还价  鼓动“和谈”就是美帝帮凶

    越南《人民军队报》痛斥为美帝效劳的“和谈”谬论
    反对侵略不能讨价还价  鼓动“和谈”就是美帝帮凶
    新华社河内二十三日电　越南《人民军队报》十九日发表评论员文章，谴责在越南问题上为美帝国主义效劳的各种“和谈”谬论。
    文章指出，在全世界的政治生活中，越南战争问题正占着中心位置。对于解决越南战争，归根结蒂有如下三种主要意见：
    （一）美国当局喋喋不休地说，它十分“希望和平讨论”，“希望结束战争”，“和平的钥匙掌握在河内的手中”。
    （二）自称为“对越南问题十分担心”的其他一些人，强调要“召开会议来讨论”。他们认为，“河内应该坐到会议桌上来以表示自己的和平诚意”。
    （三）我国人民曾多次阐明自己的立场，胡主席在最近发表的《告全国同胞书》中又强调指出：“美国必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须把美国军队和它的帮凶军全部撤出越南，这样和平就会立即恢复。越南的立场是很明确的：这就是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。此外，没有其他办法！”
    文章对上述意见作了分析。
    文章在列举美国总统约翰逊玩弄“和谈”阴谋的大量事实后指出，美国政府叫嚷的所谓“和平”、“讨论”，其实质是要千方百计地达到侵略越南的目的。美国的立场是，要以实力来迫使越南人民屈服，进行谈判，接受它的意图。它的意图就是，延长美国军队对南方的占领，要越南南方民族解放阵线放下武器投降，要越南人民接受美国在南方的新殖民主义制度。
    文章指出，自称“对越南问题十分担心”的人正在极力鼓动“和平谈判”。他们提出的计划程序如下：美国“停止轰炸”越南北方；召开“和平谈判会议”；讨论“停火”问题；讨论“撤走外国军队”问题；就“解决内部政治问题”交换意见。
    文章说，乍看起来，好象这是和美国的立场完全不同的态度。真是这样吗？不！美国悍然袭击越南民主共和国，是对一个独立和拥有主权的国家的明目张胆的侵犯。美国的罪行必须受到惩罚。美国当然必须停止轰炸北方，而且要立即无条件和永远地停止，没有什么“讨价还价”，没有什么“让步”的。
    文章指出，提出同美国谈判的问题，要求越南南方人民在美国一味顽固地拒绝越南人民的一切神圣的基本民族权利，加强对越南的侵略战争和极力使用军事压力的时候同美国“停火”，这是鼓励美国侵略者得寸进尺。美国发动了对越南的侵略战争，为什么不迫使美国必须停止它的罪恶行动，反而要求讨论呢？
    文章说，讨论“撤走外国军队”问题意味着什么呢？谁是目前在南方的唯一的外国军队？很明显，只有美国远征军和它的帮凶军是必须撤走的“外国军队”。美国政府从越南南方撤走军队和销毁军事基地，战火就会立即停止。美国不这样做，如果一味同它开会讨论，不就是承认美国出兵侵略越南是正当的吗？上述和平谈判论调基本上同美国狡诈的“和平谈判”论调一样。
    文章说，越南人民坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略战争，以保卫越南祖国的主权、独立、统一和领土完整。充分体现在胡主席最近发表的《告全国同胞书》中的越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，是不可动摇的立场。越南人民要坚决保卫神圣的民族权利，不管要付出多大的牺牲，越南人民也坚决保卫它。这是不能讨价还价的原则问题。认为越南人民太“强硬”的论调，是旨在制造政治压力，妄图迫使我国人民退缩，放弃自己的正当民族权利。这显然是袒护美国侵略者。
    文章最后说，美帝国主义目前正在加紧把侵略战争加强到极其剧烈的程度。美国的假和平论调不外是掩盖它的疯狂“升级”行动。面对侵略者的这种行动，越南人民只有一条路，就是坚决抵抗侵略到底。只要越南土地上还有一个美国强盗，我们就要打。这就是越南全体人民不可动摇的决心。
