The head of the Indonesian delegation, Sukhario, read a paper at the Beijing Physics Conference today, strongly condemning the brutal persecution of progressive Indonesian scientists by the U.S.-backed fascist military regime in Indonesia and exposing U.S. imperialist cultural infiltration. He said that U.S. imperialism, in order to strangle the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people against imperialism and old and new colonialism, instigated the reactionary clique led by Nasution and Suharto to seize state power, establishing a fascist military regime. This counter-revolutionary fascist military regime is ruthlessly expelling progressive scientists and students from universities, throwing them into prison, and even executing them without proper legal procedures.

He said that the U.S.-backed fascist military regime in Indonesia has also closed progressive associations and universities, banned all activities of progressive scientists and student organizations, reinstated reactionary teachers who were dismissed before the military coup for their hostile attitude towards the Indonesian revolution, organized reactionary students to carry out savage terrorist acts against progressive and democratic individuals, and created the most vicious anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese racism terror. He said that all this has put Indonesian science and academic life in a very miserable state.

Sukhario also mentioned that U.S. imperialism is vigorously promoting its neo-colonialist policies in Indonesia, infiltrating Indonesian culture, and attempting to completely control Indonesian intellectuals to serve its conquest of the Indonesian people and plunder of Indonesia's rich resources. Sukhario pointed out that with the help of U.S. imperialist lackeys, many progressive Indonesian books have been burned, and a large number of reactionary books promoting American culture have been imported, with the so-called "American way of life" spreading everywhere, all of which are destroying Indonesian national science and culture and poisoning the Indonesian people.

Sukhario emphasized that U.S. imperialist cultural infiltration and the fascist military regime supported by U.S. imperialism have become serious obstacles to the development of Indonesian national science and culture, and these obstacles must be completely eliminated.

The paper read by the Indonesian scientists was warmly welcomed with enthusiastic applause in the conference hall. Zhou Peiyuan, the head of the Chinese delegation, said at the meeting, "Comrade Sukhario read a very good paper, which raised some very meaningful questions for the development of national science and culture in the four continents." He said, "The Chinese people firmly support the Indonesian people's heroic struggle against U.S. imperialism, against the fascist military regime, and for national independence."

Dr. Hegazy, a Sudanese scientist, gave a lecture titled "Some Problems in Physics Teaching at Sudan University" at the plenary session, also touching on the importance of eliminating colonial influences for the development of the country's educational undertakings. He mentioned that Sudan is training its own teachers of physics and other natural sciences, compiling appropriate textbooks that keep up with the development trend, and gradually changing the current situation where foreign teachers who do not understand Sudanese language teach physics and natural sciences in English in Sudan's middle schools and universities.

Japanese young scientist Tsuda Kiyoshi, in a paper titled "The Establishment Process of the 'Group System' in the Physics Department of Hokkaido University," said that Japanese young researchers have been working with the people to make their country independent and peaceful, and have been working to develop independent and democratic scientific research. He said that to achieve such a requirement, not only researchers themselves must unite, but they must also closely unite with the people.

The Beijing Physics Conference held a plenary session this morning and academic sessions in groups this afternoon. In today's morning plenary session, scientists from three countries also gave academic reports.

Cambodian scientist Chokoma read an academic report titled "Essential Teaching Tools for Training Physicists," co-authored with the head of the Cambodian delegation, Chhun, which outlined the fundamental knowledge required for training physicists at the Institute of Technology.

Iraqi scientist Jabir gave a report titled "Research on Secondary Electron Emission of Certain Solids." The reporter proposed that electrons can be emitted to the surfaces of various metal or semiconductor targets to study the distribution of electron energy and the efficiency of various metal targets.

Japanese scientist Hayakawa Yukio, in a report titled "Progress in Japanese Cosmic Ray Research," briefly described the development of cosmic ray research in nuclear physics in Japan from 1930 to 1960.

In the afternoon's nuclear physics group academic session, a paper read by a Sri Lankan scientist introduced how they used isotope penetration technology to study the early movement of filaria after entering the host. Chilean scientist Martinoya's paper used physical and mathematical methods to conduct an interesting study on the complex phenomenon of exchange between the inside and outside of a tube when blood flows through a blood vessel. Chinese scientist Wu Chengli, representing the Theoretical Physics Teaching and Research Group of Jilin University, read a paper on the residual interactions of light nuclei, introducing their meaningful exploration of the laws of residual force interactions between nucleons within the nucleus under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, starting from a detailed grasp of materials and not being superstitious about books.

In the solid-state physics group academic session, Japanese scientist Utsui Tsuneo read a paper titled "Dynamics of Quantum Statistical Condensates." Algerian scientist Yusuf's paper studied the problem of electron temperature in vacuum diode emission. Pakistani scientist Sakar read a paper co-authored with another Pakistani scientist, studying the problem of excess noise generated when reverse bias current passes through a phototriode. In the physics education group academic session, Japanese scientist Namiki Yoshihiro read a paper titled "Physics Teaching at Waseda University School of Science and Engineering."

Tonight, scientists from various countries watched the wide-screen color film "The East Is Red."

专栏：

    印度尼西亚代表团长在北京物理讨论会上宣读论文
    谴责美帝文化渗透和印尼法西斯政权迫害科学家
    周培源团长表示中国人民坚决支持印尼人民争取独立的斗争
    苏丹日本柬埔寨伊拉克锡兰智利阿尔及利亚巴基斯坦科学家宣读论文或作报告
    新华社二十八日讯　一些国家的科学家今天在北京物理讨论会上宣读的论文或学术报告，以大量无可辩驳的事例向人们表明，长期遭受帝国主义侵略和压迫的国家要想发展本民族的科学文化事业，必须把反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争进行到底，彻底清除帝国主义的遗毒和文化渗透。
    印度尼西亚科学家代表团团长苏哈里约宣读的一篇论文，强烈谴责受到美帝国主义支持的印度尼西亚法西斯军事政权对印度尼西亚进步科学家的残酷迫害，揭露了美帝国主义对印度尼西亚的文化渗透。他说，美帝国主义为了扼杀印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义的革命斗争高潮，策动了以纳苏蒂安、苏哈托为首的将领委员会反动集团攫取国家政权，建立了法西斯军事政权。这个反革命的法西斯军事政权正在横蛮地把进步科学家和学生从大学里开除出去，把他们投进监狱，甚至不经过正常的法律程序就把他们处死。
    他说，受到美帝国主义支持的印度尼西亚法西斯军事政权还关闭进步学会和大学，禁止所有进步科学家和学生组织的活动，重新任用反动军事政变以前因为对印度尼西亚革命抱敌对态度而被解聘的反动教师，组织反动学生发动反对进步和民主人士的野蛮的恐怖行为，制造最恶毒的反华排华的种族主义恐怖。他说，这一切就使得印度尼西亚当前的科学事业和学术生活处于极为可悲的境地。
    苏哈里约还谈到，美帝国主义正在印度尼西亚极力推行它的新殖民主义政策，对印度尼西亚进行文化渗透，企图完全控制印度尼西亚的知识分子，以便为它们征服印度尼西亚人民和掠夺印度尼西亚的丰富资源服务。苏哈里约指出，在美帝国主义仆从的帮助下，许多印度尼西亚进步书籍被焚毁，大量宣扬美国文化的反动书籍源源进口，所谓“美国生活方式”到处泛滥，这些都正在摧残着印度尼西亚的民族科学文化和毒害着印度尼西亚人民。
    苏哈里约强调指出，美帝国主义的文化渗透和受到美帝支持的反人民、反民主的法西斯军事政权，已经构成对发展印度尼西亚民族科学文化的严重障碍，这些障碍都必须予以彻底清除。
    印度尼西亚科学家宣读的论文，在会场上受到了特别热烈的鼓掌欢迎。中国科学家代表团团长周培源在会上说：“苏哈里约团长给我们宣读了一篇很好的论文，它提出了一些对于我们四大洲各国发展民族科学文化都很有意义的问题。”他说：“中国人民坚决支持印度尼西亚人民反对美帝国主义、反对法西斯军事政权、争取民族独立的英勇斗争。”
    苏丹科学家赫加齐博士在全体会议上所作的一篇题为《苏丹大学物理教学中的一些问题》的学术报告，也涉及了清除殖民主义影响对发展本国教育事业的重要性。他谈到，苏丹正在培养本民族的物理学和其他自然科学的教师，编制能跟上发展趋势的适当的教科书，逐步改变目前苏丹的中学和大学由不懂苏丹话的外国人用英语讲授物理和自然科学的情况。
    日本青年科学家持田洁在一篇题为《北海道大学物理系“小组制”建立经过》的论文中说，日本青年研究人员一直在和人民一道为使自己的国家获得独立和和平而工作，一直在为发展独立的、民主的科学研究事业而工作。他说，要实现这样的要求，不但研究人员自己要联合起来，而且要同人民紧密地联合起来。
    北京物理讨论会今天上午举行全体会议，下午分组举行学术会议。在今天上午的全体会议上，还有三个国家的科学家作了学术报告。
    柬埔寨科学家乔科马，宣读了他和柬埔寨科学家代表团团长吉春合写的题为《培养物理学者所需要的教学工具》的学术报告，概述了理工学院培养物理学者所不可缺少的基础知识问题。
    伊拉克科学家加利卜作了题为《某些固体的二次电子发射的研究》的报告。报告人提出，可以把电子发射到各种金属靶或者半导体靶的表面上，来研究电子能量的分布情况和各种金属靶的效率。
    日本科学家早川幸男在题为《日本宇宙射线研究的进展》的报告中，简述了日本从一九三○年到一九六○年间核物理方面宇宙射线研究的发展情况。
    在今天下午举行的原子核物理组学术会议上，锡兰科学家宣读的一篇有关放射性同位素技术应用的论文，介绍了他们如何利用同位素渗入技术研究丝虫进入寄主后的早期移动情况。智利科学家马丁诺亚宣读的论文，用物理和数学的方法，对血液在血管中流过时管内外交换的复杂现象，作了有趣的研究。中国科学工作者吴成礼代表吉林大学理论物理教研室宣读的关于轻核残余相互作用的论文，介绍了他们在毛泽东思想指导下，不迷信书本，从详细地占有材料入手，对原子核内核子间残余力相互作用的规律作了有意义的探讨。
    在固体物理组学术会议上，日本科学家碓井恒丸宣读了题为《量子统计凝聚体的动力学》的论文。阿尔及利亚科学家优素福的一篇论文，研究了二极管在真空中发射的电子温度问题。巴基斯坦科学家萨卡尔宣读了他和巴基斯坦另一位科学家合写的一篇论文。论文作者研究了反向偏压电流通过光三极管时所产生的多余噪音问题。在物理教学组学术会议上，日本科学家并木美喜雄宣读了题为《早稻田大学理工学院的物理教学》的论文。
