At the Guizhou Province Industrial, Transportation, and Basic Construction System Technical Innovation and Technological Revolution Exhibition, a pole car in the postal and telecommunications section attracted great interest from visitors.

This pole car has a simple structure: a pole with a fixed small wooden box at one end, equipped with two small iron wheels underneath; the other end has a sliding wooden frame. The wooden box is used to carry letters and important mail, while the wooden frame is used to secure mailbags, packages, newspapers, and other items. On flat roads or gentle slopes, the wooden frame can be pulled to the side of the wooden box, allowing it to be pulled or pushed like a cart. When encountering steep slopes or rivers, the wooden frame can be pulled back to the end of the pole, allowing it to be carried. The pole car itself weighs only about five kilograms and can carry a load of forty kilograms, navigating paths as narrow as one meter. It is agile and convenient, significantly reducing the workload of rural mail carriers in mountainous areas.

The designer and manufacturer of the pole car is Zhou Defen, a Miao ethnic rural mail carrier from Tianzhu County who has been working in the mountains for fifteen years. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    减轻邮递员劳动强度
    贵州创造两用扁担车
    在贵州省工业、交通和基本建设系统技术革新技术革命展览会的邮电馆里，有一种扁担车，引起了参观者的极大兴趣。
    这种扁担车构造简单：一根扁担，一头有一个固定的小木箱，下面装着两个小铁轮；另一头有一个可以滑动的小木架。木箱装信件和重要邮件，木架用来捆绑邮袋包裹、书报等物。在平路或坡度不大的山路上，把木架拽到木箱一边，可以当车子拖着或推着走。遇到上大坡、过溪河时，再把木架拽回扁担的一头，可以挑起来走。扁担车本身重量只有五公斤左右，能载重四十来公斤，在一尺多宽的小路上行走。它灵巧轻便，可以大大减轻山区乡邮员的劳动强度。
    设计制造扁担车的，是在山区工作了十五年的天柱县邮电局苗族乡邮员周德文。（据新华社）
