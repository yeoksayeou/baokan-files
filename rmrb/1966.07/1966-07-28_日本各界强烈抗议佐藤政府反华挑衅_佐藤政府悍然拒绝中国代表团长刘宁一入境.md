Japanese Circles Strongly Protest Sato Government's Provocations Against China
Sato Government Brazenly Refuses Entry to Chinese Delegation Head Liu Ningyi

New China News Agency, July 27th: Tokyo News: The Sato government of Japan brazenly announced on the 26th that it would refuse to issue an entry visa to Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese delegation to the 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, scheduled to be held at the end of this month. Liu Ningyi is also the vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. This is another serious step by the Sato government to intensify its pro-American, anti-Soviet, and anti-China policy, deliberately obstructing and sabotaging the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan.

It is worth noting that the Sato government made this unreasonable decision at a time when Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko was visiting Japan, consorting with Japanese reactionaries, and jointly plotting anti-China conspiracies. The Sato government's decision, which caters to the anti-China needs of the United States and the Soviet Union, fully exposes its reactionary nature of hostility towards China and hatred towards the Chinese people. It once again exposes the Sato government's recent propaganda about improving Sino-Japanese relations as sheer lies.

According to reports, the Sato government's reactionary decision was made by the Immigration Bureau of the Ministry of Justice based on the "official instructions" of Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina and Justice Minister Mitsujiro Ishii. It was announced during a meeting on the evening of the 26th with representatives of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, including the executive director Masaharu Hatana.

Various Japanese mass organizations strongly protested the Sato government's reactionary decision to sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship. The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and other organizations took simultaneous action on the 27th to protest the Sato government's illegal and unreasonable decision to refuse entry to the heads of the Chinese delegation, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

Executive director Masaharu Hatana and secretary-general Yoshikiyo Yoshida of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs went to the Ministry of Justice to lodge a strong protest, pointing out that the Sato government's "reason for not issuing entry visas is groundless and cannot be accepted." They demanded that the Sato government revoke this decision.

The Japan-China Friendship Association issued a statement condemning the Sato government, stating: "This refusal to issue entry visas is a clear sign that the government is deliberately sabotaging Sino-Japanese relations and is a provocative action in response to the U.S. gradual expansion of the Vietnam War."

The Japan-Vietnam Friendship Association, the Japan Peace Committee, and Socialist Party Diet member Haruo Okada separately went to the Ministry of Justice to submit letters demanding that the Sato government allow all delegates applying to enter Japan to attend the World Conference.

    日本各界强烈抗议佐藤政府反华挑衅
    佐藤政府悍然拒绝中国代表团长刘宁一入境
    新华社二十七日讯  东京消息：日本佐藤政府二十六日悍然宣布拒绝发给出席在本月底举行的第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的中国代表团团长、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席、中华全国总工会主席刘宁一入境签证。这是佐藤政府加紧推行亲美、联苏、反华路线，蓄意阻挠和破坏中日两国人民友好关系的又一个严重步骤。
    值得注意的是，佐藤政府这个无理决定是在苏联外交部长葛罗米柯正在日本“访问”，同日本反动派搞得火热，共同策划反华阴谋的时候作出的。佐藤政府这一迎合美苏反华需要的决定，充分暴露了它敌视中国和仇视中国人民的反动面目，再一次揭穿佐藤政府最近散布的所谓要改善日中关系的论调，完全是骗人的鬼话。
    据报道，佐藤政府的这一反动决定，是由法务省入国管理局根据外务大臣椎名悦三郎和法务大臣石井光次郎的“正式指示”，在二十六日晚上会见日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会代表理事畑中政春等人时宣布的。
    日本各群众团体强烈抗议佐藤政府的这一破坏中日友好的反动决定。日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会、日中友好协会等团体二十七日同时采取行动，抗议日本佐藤政府非法地和毫无道理地拒绝中国代表团团长刘宁一和越南民主共和国、越南南方民族解放阵线、以及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表团入境参加第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的决定。
    禁止原子弹氢弹协议会代表理事畑中政春和事务局长吉田嘉清前往法务省提出严正抗议，他们指出佐藤政府“不发入境签证的理由是毫无道理的，不能予以承认。”他们要求佐藤政府撤销这一决定。
    日中友好协会发表声明谴责日本佐藤政府说：“这种拒不发入境签证的做法，是政府蓄意破坏日中关系的明确迹象，是响应美国逐步扩大侵越战争的挑衅性行动。”
    日越友好协会、日本和平委员会和社会党国会议员冈田春夫分别前往法务省递交信件，要求佐藤政府让申请入境出席世界大会的全体代表团进入日本。
