The emergency conference of Asian and African writers, held in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, from June 27 to July 9, 1966, with over 160 representatives from cultural organizations in 53 Asian and African countries and regions, expressed deep concern after hearing the report by the delegation of the Patriotic Cultural Association of Laos on the situation in Laos. The conference unanimously agreed with the report and adopted the following resolution:

(1) The conference strongly and resolutely opposes and condemns the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys for their persistent violations of the Geneva Agreement on Laos and the various agreements signed by the three sides in Laos. The conference condemns the evil plots of the U.S. imperialists to further escalate and expand the war of aggression in Laos, and condemns the inhuman atrocities they have committed against the people of Laos.

(2) The conference expresses admiration for the courage and determination of the people of Laos and the patriotic forces of Laos in defending their sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity. The conference fully supports the just struggle of the people of Laos and the patriotic forces of Laos against U.S. imperialism for national salvation, recognizing this struggle as an important part of the common cause of defending world peace and achieving national liberation. The conference fully endorses the four-point stance and five measures adopted by the National Political Consultative Conference of Laos on October 13, 1965, and considers these stances and measures to be the sole correct basis for resolving the Laos issue.

(3) The conference unanimously demands that U.S. imperialism strictly and thoroughly implement the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos. The conference demands that all military personnel, semi-military organizations, disguised military organizations, and illegally imported weapons, ammunition, and other war materials of the United States and its lackeys must be immediately and completely withdrawn from Laos. At the same time, the conference demands that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys immediately cease using military aircraft and B-52 strategic bombers to bomb and strafe the liberated areas of the patriotic forces of Laos.

(4) To concentrate all efforts to accelerate the failure of the U.S. imperialist war of aggression, the conference calls on the broad masses of Asian and African peoples, especially all writers and artists in Asia and Africa, to use all their means and redouble their efforts to support the heroic struggle of the people of Laos and the patriotic forces of Laos against U.S. imperialist aggression and to defend Laos' sovereignty, independence, peace, and neutrality.
