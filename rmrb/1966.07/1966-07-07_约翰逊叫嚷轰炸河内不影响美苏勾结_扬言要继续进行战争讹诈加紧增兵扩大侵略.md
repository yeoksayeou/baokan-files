According to a report from New China News Agency on July 6, Washington: On July 5, U.S. President Johnson, in a press conference, once again admitted in the tone of a complete bandit that the imperialist ambitions of U.S. imperialism are boundless. He believed that "at this time, taking this action (referring to the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong) is what the current situation requires," and "we intend to continue doing so."

He threatened that in the future, he would "do everything possible to encourage" and "support" the U.S. troops invading Vietnam; and would continue to purchase military supplies for the invasion of Vietnam, expand the military at home, and dispatch more U.S. troops to South Vietnam.

Johnson also revealed that the United States is hastening to plan specific steps to expand the war in Vietnam. He announced that U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara will soon go to Honolulu to listen to the report of Pacific Command Commander Sharp on "military operations in Southeast Asia," and will discuss with Sharp the "logistics plans for supporting future operations."

A reporter asked Johnson whether the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong would affect the agreement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on "preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons." To this, Johnson bluntly replied: "I don't think it will cause any damage. We are doing everything possible to reach such an agreement. We very much hope to reach such an agreement."

Johnson's remarks are in complete harmony with the speech of Soviet representative Roshchin at the Geneva Disarmament Conference. Roshchin and Johnson's singing in unison fully exposed the criminal nature of the Soviet revisionist leadership in their fake support and actual betrayal on the Vietnam issue.

    约翰逊叫嚷轰炸河内不影响美苏勾结
    扬言要继续进行战争讹诈加紧增兵扩大侵略
    据新华社六日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊五日在记者招待会上用十足的强盗口吻再一次供认，美帝国主义的侵略野心是无止境的。他认为，“在这个时候采取这个行动（按指轰炸河内、海防）是当前的事态所需要的”，“我们打算继续这样作。”
    他扬言，今后他还将“尽一切力量鼓励”和“支持”侵越美军；并将继续增购侵越军火继续在国内扩军和增派美军去南越。
    约翰逊还透露，美国正在加紧策划扩大侵越战争的具体步骤。他宣布，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉即将去檀香山听取太平洋地区美军司令夏普“关于东南亚军事行动计划的报告”，并将同夏普讨论“有关支持今后作战的后勤计划”。
    有记者问约翰逊，美国轰炸河内、海防，会不会影响美苏在“防止扩散核武器”方面达成协议。对此，约翰逊断然回答说：“我认为没有损害。我们正在尽一切可能以就这样一项条约达成协议。我们非常希望达成这种协议。”
    约翰逊这番话同参加日内瓦裁军会议的苏联代表罗申的讲话如出一辙、十分合拍。罗申和约翰逊的一唱一和，充分暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团在越南问题上的假支持、真出卖的罪恶面目。
