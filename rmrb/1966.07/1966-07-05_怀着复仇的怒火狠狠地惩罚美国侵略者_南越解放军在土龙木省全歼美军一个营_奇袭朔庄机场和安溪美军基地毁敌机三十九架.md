The Liberation Army of South Vietnam, with vengeful fury, severely punished the American aggressors who dared to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong. On July 1 and 2, in the Karong area northwest of the Cham Ly Bridge in Tuy Hoa Province, they annihilated an entire battalion of the U.S. First Infantry Division. This is another glorious victory following the complete annihilation of a U.S. tank and armored vehicle unit by the Liberation Army in the Cham Ly Bridge area on June 30.

The report said that after suffering heavy losses in Cham Ly Bridge on June 30, the U.S. aggressors were not willing to admit defeat. On July 1, they air-dropped troops into the Karong area, about ten kilometers northwest of Cham Ly Bridge. As soon as this U.S. force landed and advanced towards Ban Me Thuot, they were immediately ambushed by local guerrillas and militia. At 3:30 PM, the U.S. aggressors again dropped another unit into the Karong area, attempting to link up with the U.S. forces in Ban Me Thuot, but they were intercepted and partially annihilated by the guerrillas and militia.

At 5:00 PM, a unit of the Liberation Army arrived in the Karong area and, catching the enemy off guard, immediately launched an attack. They killed hundreds of enemy soldiers and surrounded the remaining enemy forces. The Liberation Army soldiers, determined to punish the American aggressors and avenge their northern brethren, fought tenaciously throughout the night, tightly gripping the enemy and creating favorable conditions for their comrades to annihilate the enemy.

On the morning of July 2, various units of the Liberation Army launched a simultaneous assault on the U.S. camp in Karong. The soldiers, burning with a vengeful flame, swiftly and bravely charged into the enemy ranks, splitting and annihilating them. In just one hour of fierce hand-to-hand combat, they completely annihilated a battalion of the U.S. First Infantry Division, shot down four helicopters, and seized a large amount of weapons and ammunition.

The Vietnam People's Army Newspaper commented on July 4 that the South Vietnamese Liberation Forces, with their victory in Karong, have warned the American aggressors: for every doubling of their attacks on North Vietnam, they will face tenfold retaliation.

The Liberation Forces of South Vietnam recently launched another surprise attack on the Soai Rap Airbase and the An Khe U.S. military base, severely punishing the American aggressors. Preliminary reports indicate that a total of thirty-nine military aircraft were destroyed, and more than eighty U.S. aggressors were killed.

On the night of June 21 to the early morning of June 22, the Liberation Forces in Soai Rap Province launched a fierce assault on the Soai Rap Airbase, destroying twenty-seven types of U.S. aircraft and seven warehouses filled with military equipment, and killing many U.S. soldiers.

On the night of June 5, the Liberation Forces in Gia Lai Province launched a fierce attack on the base of the U.S. First Cavalry Division in An Khe. Preliminary reports indicate that twelve helicopters were destroyed, more than seventy U.S. aggressors were killed, and many barracks and bunkers were demolished. This is the ninth attack on the Soai Rap Airbase and the second attack on the U.S. base in An Khe by the Liberation Forces.

    南越解放军在土龙木省全歼美军一个营
    奇袭朔庄机场和安溪美军基地毁敌机三十九架
    据新华社河内四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放军痛惩胆敢轰炸河内、海防的美国强盗，七月一日和二日，在土龙木省芹黎桥西北面的卡茸地区全歼美国第一步兵师一个整营。这是继六月三十日解放军在土龙木省芹黎桥地区全歼美军一个坦克和装甲车战团之后，取得的又一次辉煌胜利。
    报道说，美国侵略军六月三十日在芹黎桥遭到沉重的打击之后，并不甘心失败，七月一日又空投军队到芹黎桥西北十多公里的卡茸地区。当这支美军着陆后向保诺方面前进时，立即遭到当地游击队和地方部队的狙击。下午三时三十分，美国侵略军又在卡茸地区投下另一支部队，企图同在保诺的那支美军汇合，又遭到游击队和地方部队的截击，并被歼一部。
    下午五时，解放军的一支部队到达卡茸地区后，出敌不意立即投入战斗，歼敌数百，并把剩下的敌人围困起来。解放军战士们决心惩罚美国侵略强盗，为北方骨肉同胞报仇，同敌人进行了整整一个晚上的顽强战斗，紧紧地咬住敌人不放，为兄弟部队全歼敌人创造了有利条件。
    七月二日清晨，解放军的各路部队一齐向卡茸美军营地发起进攻。战士们胸中燃烧着复仇的火焰，迅速勇猛地插入敌群，把敌人分割围歼。仅仅经过一小时的激烈肉搏战，就全部歼灭了美国第一步兵师的一个营，击落直升飞机四架，缴获大批武器和弹药。
    越南《人民军队报》四日发表评论指出，南方解放武装力量用卡茸大捷警告美国强盗：它对越南北方的袭击增加一倍，就要遭到成十倍的打击。
    新华社河内四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量最近再次奇袭朔庄机场和安溪美军基地，严惩美国强盗。据初步消息，共击毁各种军用飞机三十九架，打死美国侵略军八十多名。
    六月二十一日深夜到二十二日凌晨，朔庄省解放武装力量向朔庄机场发动猛烈进攻，击毁各种类型美国飞机二十七架，摧毁装满军用设备的仓库七座，打死美军多名。
    嘉莱省解放武装力量六月五日深夜猛烈袭击美国第一骑兵师在安溪的基地。据初步消息，共击毁直升飞机十二架，打死美国侵略军七十多名，摧毁许多兵营和碉堡。这是解放武装力量第九次袭击朔庄机场和第二次进攻美军安溪基地。
