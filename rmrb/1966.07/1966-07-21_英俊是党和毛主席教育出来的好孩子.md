Upon hearing that Yingjun had sacrificed himself, both my husband and I were overcome with grief and shed tears. We only have this one son, how could we not be heartbroken? But then we thought, Yingjun sacrificed himself to protect the lives of the people, he did the right thing, he did well. Chairman Mao said, "To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai..." Yingjun's death is weightier than Mount Tai. He did not disappoint the Party's hopes, he did not disappoint Chairman Mao's hopes, and he did not disappoint our hopes.

Just a few days after Yingjun's sacrifice, my husband and I went to Jiamusi to attend the memorial service. Many comrades said, "Yingjun is our good example, he will forever live in our hearts." The local people also said, "Yingjun is your son, but he is also the son of the 300,000 people of Jiamusi. He sacrificed himself for us, we will forever remember him and learn from him." Hearing these words, I felt even more that my child had died a glorious death. With tears in my eyes, I looked at Chairman Mao's portrait and thought: Chairman Mao, it is you who saved us from the sea of suffering, it is you who educated Yingjun into a good child. I will follow your words forever, I will follow you forever.

When Yingjun was young, he often asked us to tell him about the hardships of the old society. Sometimes, when we talked about how his uncle was killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, he would get so angry that his small eyes would bulge, and he would raise his little fist and say, "When I grow up, I will definitely join the army to avenge my uncle!" Sometimes, when we talked about how the Party and Chairman Mao led us laboring people to rebel and take the socialist road, he would get so excited that he would shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

He was born in the old society and grew up in the new society, so he did not suffer much. When he was a bit older, he even did not want to wear clothes with patches. I thought he was forgetting his roots. To educate him not to forget the past, I took him to see the old brick kiln where we used to live. Yingjun asked me, "Mom, why did we come to this place?" I said, "Yingjun, this was our home in the old society!" He said, "This place is so low that one cannot even stand up straight, how can people live here?" I said, "Child, it was in this place that I gave birth to you. At that time, your father and I fled from Dalian to here to do hard labor, and we did not even have a place to stay, so we had to live in this broken kiln. When I gave birth to you, I did not have a single grain of food for three days, not even a sip of hot water! At that time, the clothes I wore were so torn that the back was worn out, but we did not even have money to buy a patch of cloth! Think about the past and look at the present, you grew up in the new society and do not even want to wear clothes with patches, isn't this forgetting your roots? If it were not for the Party and Chairman Mao saving us from the fire, we would not even have our lives, let alone clothes to wear..." Yingjun listened and listened, and with tears in his eyes, he said to me, "Mom, I was wrong..." After that, he changed a lot in many ways. He used his pocket money to buy two portraits of Chairman Mao, framed them, and hung them on the wall. He truly loved our great leader Chairman Mao from the bottom of his heart. Every morning when he went to school and every evening when he came back from school, he would always look at Chairman Mao's portrait and sing, "There is a North Star in the sky, and there is Mao Zedong on the earth..." After that, he studied even harder, took the initiative to do all kinds of labor, and tried his best to help others when he saw someone in trouble. During his school days, he was rated as an exemplary student of diligent work and study, an outstanding Young Pioneer, and was also rewarded and praised by the district and municipal Communist Youth League organizations.

In 1962, with the support of American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek wanted to invade the mainland. My husband and I were very angry when we heard this and firmly supported our son joining the army to defend our people's country. Yingjun left, and I was both relieved and worried. I was relieved because I had handed my son over to our army, and there would be no mistakes; I was worried because, although Yingjun had grown up, he was still a child after all, and he was always a bit reckless. So, after he had been gone for more than two months, I went to the army to see him. When I saw him, he was wearing a well-fitting military uniform and looked very spirited. The leaders were very considerate of me and had Yingjun accompany me. He happily told me, "The army is great, the old comrades, platoon leaders, and company leaders take care of us so well, even at night when the blanket kicks off, they cover it for us." He showed me a book of Chairman Mao's writings and said, "Our first lesson after enlisting was to learn Chairman Mao's 'In Memory of Norman Bethune.'" I thought, the child has taken the bright path pointed out by Chairman Mao, what do I have to worry about? Seeing that the work in the army was very busy, I only stayed for three days and then returned home.

In May 1964, I went to see Yingjun for the second time. At that time, he was working in the production area, and the company specially sent someone to call him back. When he entered the door, I could hardly recognize him. He had grown taller, stronger, and much fatter than when he was at home, with a ruddy complexion. I pulled him to me and looked at him again and again, laughing so much that I could not close my mouth. At night, it was past ten o'clock, and we two lay in bed chatting. Suddenly, he got up and went out. It turned out that he remembered that the seeds for tomorrow's production were not enough, and there was a shortage of horse harnesses. After talking to the political instructor, he prepared the things needed for production and then came back to continue talking with me.

That night, he specially talked to me about his gains from studying Chairman Mao's works. He said that after studying Chairman Mao's works, his mind was so bright! He understood how a person should live meaningfully. He told me how Zhang Zedong devoted himself to the people, and Chairman Mao said his death was weightier than Mount Tai; Dr. Bethune was a foreigner, over fifty years old, who crossed the ocean to come to China to help our revolution, with no personal gain. He said he would definitely learn from Zhang Zedong and Dr. Bethune, dedicating everything to the people. I felt that he had read Chairman Mao's books and listened to Chairman Mao's words, and his mind was full of revolutionary greatness. He was truly progressing with each reading of Chairman Mao's books. When I left, I told him, "Child, you must listen to Chairman Mao's words and walk the right path." He happily said, "Mom, don't worry, I will definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works well!" He did this himself and also helped us do it, often writing to us to talk about Chairman Mao's words, urging us to firmly follow the Party. Just before his sacrifice, he still wrote on the back of an envelope of a letter to his family the following words of Chairman Mao:

"In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and every thought is stamped with the mark of class."

He told us to listen to Chairman Mao's words, never forget class struggle, and always stand firmly on the proletarian position.

This spring festival, Yingjun came home on leave, carrying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" with him. As soon as he got home, he went to the military department to find work. He had free time to do mass work, doing good deeds everywhere, visiting the families of comrades-in-arms, doing ideological work for students, and every day he came home very late. But no matter how late it was, he would study Chairman Mao's works for a while and write some thoughts. He said, "I must learn from Lei Feng and Wang Jie, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." Once, some relatives came to visit him and asked Yingjun when he would be demobilized. He said, "American imperialism is still killing and burning in Vietnam, Chiang Kai-shek is still in Taiwan, and there are still millions of people suffering in the world, I cannot be demobilized, the revolution needs me to do it for as long as it needs me. Our struggle goal is to achieve communism throughout the world." He also said, "I now belong to the people, the people's needs are my wishes." The child had truly taken Chairman Mao's books to heart, he stood higher and saw farther. My husband and I were both happy about his progress, and this was all the result of Chairman Mao's education!

Yingjun is now gone, but I see that everyone is learning from him, proposing to learn from Chairman Mao's highest instructions, faithfully execute the highest instructions, enthusiastically propagate the highest instructions, and bravely defend the highest instructions. My heart is filled with joy. Chairman Mao is the great savior of the laboring people, Chairman Mao's books are the lifeblood of the laboring people, no matter what, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. My husband and I, although we are old, also have the determination to learn from our son. Chairman Mao's books, I will read them for a lifetime; Chairman Mao's words, I will listen to them for a lifetime; Chairman Mao's instructions, I will execute them for a lifetime; the revolutionary path pointed out by Chairman Mao, I will walk it for a lifetime. Whoever wants to oppose us learning Mao Zedong Thought, whoever wants to restore capitalism in China, promote revisionism, and make us go back, we will fight to the end!

    英俊是党和毛主席教育出来的好孩子
    长春市二道河子区新晨农场社员、刘英俊烈士的母亲　朱秀兰
    乍一听到英俊牺牲，我和他爸爸都难过得落下了泪，俺老两口就这么一个儿子，怎能叫人不悲痛呢？可是我们又一想，英俊是为了保卫人民生命牺牲的，他做得对，做得好。毛主席他老人家说过：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重……”英俊的死是比泰山还重的。他没有辜负党的希望，没有辜负毛主席的希望，也没有辜负我们的希望。
    英俊牺牲不几天，我和老伴到佳木斯去参加追悼大会。许多同志都说：“英俊是我们的好榜样，他永远活在我们的心里。”当地群众也说：“英俊是你的儿子，也是我们佳木斯三十万人民的儿子。他为我们牺牲了，我们要永远纪念他，向他学习。”听了这些话，我更觉得孩子死得光荣。我含着热泪，望着毛主席象，心想：毛主席啊！是您老人家把俺们从苦海里救了出来，是您老人家把英俊教育成了一个好孩子。我要象儿子那样，永远听您老人家的话，永远跟着您走。
    英俊小时在家，就经常叫我们给他讲旧社会的苦日子。有时，我们讲到他叔叔被国民党反动派杀害的情形，他气得小眼睛瞪得溜圆，举起小拳头说：“我长大了一定参军给叔叔报仇！”有时，我们讲党和毛主席领导咱劳动人民翻身闹革命，走上社会主义大道，他激动得高喊“毛主席万岁”！
    他生在旧社会，长在新社会，没有受过更多的苦，年岁稍大点时，连带补钉的衣服都不爱穿了。我想这不是忘本了吗？为了教育他别忘过去，我就把他带到我们家住过的破砖窑那里去看看。英俊问我：“妈！到这个地方来干什么？”我说：“英俊啊！在旧社会，这可是咱们的家啊！”他说：“这个地方连腰都直不起来，怎能住人呢？”我说：“孩子，妈就是在这个地方生的你。那时候，妈跟你爹从大连跑到这里做苦工，连个落脚的地方都没有，咱只好住在这个破窑里。妈生你的时候，一连三天没有一颗粮下肚，连口热水都喝不上呀！那时候，妈穿的破衣服，后背都磨光了，可连块补钉布都没钱买啊！想想过去，看看现在，你长在新社会连带补钉的衣裳都不愿意穿了，这不是忘本了吗？要不是党和毛主席从火海里把咱救出来，别说穿衣服，咱们的命也不知到哪去了……”英俊听着听着含着泪跟我说：“妈，我错了……”从这以后，他各方面都有了不少的变化。他用节省下来的零花钱，买了两张毛主席象，做了两个镜框镶起来，挂在墙上。他打心眼里热爱咱们的伟大领袖毛主席。早晨上学，晚上放学，他总要望一望毛主席的象，嘴里唱着：“天上有颗北斗星，地上有个毛泽东……”以后，他学习也更加用心了，各种劳动活都抢着干，遇见别人有困难，想尽办法去帮助。在他念书的时候，就被评为勤工俭学的模范，优秀少先队员，还受到过区、市共青团组织的奖励和表扬。
    一九六二年，蒋介石在美帝国主义这个野心狼的支持下，想要窜犯大陆，我和老伴听了都非常气愤，坚决支持儿子参军去保卫咱人民的江山。英俊走了，我心里是又放心又担心，放心的是把儿子交给了咱们的队伍，准没个错儿；不放心的是，虽说英俊长大了，可他到底还是个孩子，干什么事儿都毛毛愣愣的。所以在他走了两个多月的时候，我就到部队去看他。一见面，我看他穿着一套合身的军装，显得特别精神。领导上对我特别关照，还叫英俊陪着我。他欢欢喜喜地跟我说：“部队太好了，老同志、班长、排长照顾得可周到啦，连晚上蹬了被子都给盖好。”他拿着一本毛主席的书给我看了看说：“我们入伍第一课就学毛主席写的《为人民服务》。”我想，孩子走上了毛主席指出的光明大道，我还有啥不放心的呢！看到队伍上工作很忙，我只住了三天就回来了。
    一九六四年“五一”节，我第二次去看英俊。当时，他正在生产地劳动，连里专门派人把他叫了回来。他一进门，我简直不敢认了。个头长大了，体格长壮了，比在家时胖多了，脸上黑里透红。我把他拉到跟前看了又看，乐得嘴都闭不上了。晚上，十点多了，我们娘俩躺在床上拉家常。忽然，他起来出去了。原来，他想起明天生产用的种子不够了，还缺牲口套。他和指导员说了以后，把生产用的东西准备好，才回来继续和我谈。
    这天晚上，他特别跟我谈了学习毛主席著作的收获。他说，他学了毛主席著作以后，心里可亮堂啦！懂得了一个人应该怎样活着才有意义。他给我讲张思德怎样一心一意为人民服务，毛主席说他的死比泰山还重；白求恩是外国人，五十多岁了，漂洋过海来到中国，帮助咱们革命，一点私心也没有。他说他一定要向张思德、白求恩学习，把自己的一切交给人民。我觉得他读了毛主席的书，听了毛主席的话，脑子里想的净是革命的大事，真是越读毛主席的书越进步。临走时，我跟他说：“孩子，你可一定要听毛主席的话走大道。”他高兴地说：“妈，你放心好了，我一定要好好地活学活用毛主席著作！”他自己这样做了，也帮助我们这样做，经常给我们来信讲毛主席的话，叫我们坚决跟党走。就在他牺牲前不久，还在写给家里一封信的信封背后，端端正正地抄上了这样一条毛主席语录：
    “在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”
    他告诉我们要听毛主席的话，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，千万要站稳无产阶级立场。
    今年春节，英俊探家回来，随身带着《毛泽东选集》。他一到家就到武装部联系，要求给他找活干。他有空就去做群众工作，到处做好事，看望战友的家庭，向同学做思想工作，每天都是很晚才回到家来。可是不论多晚，他都要学一阵子毛主席著作，写一段心得。他说：“我一定要向雷锋、王杰学习，做毛主席的好战士。”一次，有些亲友来看他，问英俊多咱复员，他说：“美帝国主义还在越南杀人放火，蒋介石还在台湾，世界上还有千千万万的人民受苦难，我不能复员，革命需要我干多久，我就干多久。在全世界实现共产主义，才是我们的奋斗目标。”他还说：“我现在是属于人民的，人民的需要就是我的志愿。”孩子把毛主席的书都学到心里去了，他站得更高、看得更远了。我们老两口都为他的进步感到高兴，这都是毛主席他老人家教育的结果啊！
    英俊现在虽然离开了我们，但是，我看到大家都在向他学习，提出了要象他那样努力地学习最高指示，忠实地执行最高指示，热情地宣传最高指示，勇敢地捍卫最高指示，俺的心里就越想越高兴。毛主席是咱劳动人民的大救星，毛主席的书，是咱劳动人民的命根子，咱们不论啥时候，都要听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。我和他爹，虽然是上年纪的人了，但也有决心向儿子学习。毛主席的书，俺要读一辈子；毛主席的话，俺要听一辈子；毛主席的指示，俺要执行一辈子；毛主席指出的革命的路，俺要走一辈子。谁要想反对咱们学习毛泽东思想，谁要想在中国复辟资本主义，推行修正主义，叫我们再走回头路，我们就坚决和他们拚到底！　（《解放军报》供稿）
