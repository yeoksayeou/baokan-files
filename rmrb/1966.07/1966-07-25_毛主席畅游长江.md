Our great leader Chairman Mao, on July 16, 1966, once again braved the winds and waves to swim the Yangtze River.

On this day, Wuhan was under a clear blue sky, and the banks of the Yangtze River were filled with joyous crowds.

Ten years ago in June, Chairman Mao had swum across the Yangtze River in Wuhan three times and wrote the brilliant and heroic poem "Swimming" (Water Melody). Ten years later, today, Chairman Mao once again swam in the great river, spending one hour and five minutes, covering nearly thirty li, "No matter how the wind blows or the waves beat, it is like strolling in a courtyard."

The news of Chairman Mao's second swim across the Yangtze River quickly spread throughout Wuhan. The men, women, old, and young of Wuhan were overjoyed and excited, spreading the word: "Our beloved leader Chairman Mao is so healthy; this is the greatest happiness for all the people of China! This is the greatest happiness for all revolutionary people around the world!"

On the morning of July 16, five thousand swimmers in Wuhan, following Chairman Mao's instruction to swim in the great rivers and seas to train, held the 11th Yangtze River Swimming Competition on the route opened by Chairman Mao. At this time, our great leader inspected the swimmers participating in the competition on a speedboat, which greatly encouraged all the people of Wuhan.

On July 16, the surface of the Yangtze River was smiling, and along both banks, countless flags, large banners, and cheering crowds created a scene of unprecedented festivity.

At 9:20 AM, the loudspeakers on both banks of the river played the song "The East is Red," praising our beloved leader Chairman Mao, stirring the hearts of the people. People thought: It is Chairman Mao who has opened a smooth path for us on the Yangtze River. If Chairman Mao could come to see us swim across the Yangtze River today, that would be wonderful!

Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, and Chairman Mao is always with us. Just as the competition was about to begin, a speedboat broke through the waves from the east where the sun rises. At this moment, someone among the swimmers spotted Chairman Mao on the speedboat and immediately shouted excitedly: "Chairman Mao is here! Long live Chairman Mao!" Immediately, the swimming army raised hundreds of red flags and swam towards Chairman Mao. On the flag-reddened river surface and on both banks of the river, millions of people's gazes were directed towards Chairman Mao! Millions of people expressed the same wish: Long live the great Chairman Mao! Millions of people voiced the same sentiment: Long live Chairman Mao! At the same time, the anchored ships blew their whistles in unison to express their respect for the great leader. The cheers and the whistles blended into one, shaking the skies over Wuhan.

Chairman Mao, with a radiant face and a spirited demeanor, inspected the swimming army on the deck of the speedboat. At this moment, on the vast river surface, the athletes held high red flags, and some pushed tall Chairman Mao quotation boards, forming a waterborne Great Wall, parting the thousand-layered waves, and advancing bravely. The quotation boards read: "Unity, tension, seriousness, liveliness." "The imperialists bully us like this, and this needs to be dealt with seriously." "Determine to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." Seeing the swimmers' spirited and vigorous revolutionary spirit, Chairman Mao was very pleased. He walked from one side of the speedboat to the other, waving to everyone in the midst of enthusiastic cheers and shouting, "Comrades, good! Long live the comrades!"

A group of over two hundred primary school students, mostly aged eight to fourteen, received special attention from Chairman Mao. These "Little Red Guards" gathered around the quotation board "Study hard and make progress every day," singing "We Are the Successors of Communism," braving the waves, and advancing with determination, displaying the revolutionary spirit of the red youth of the Mao Zedong era. When the children swam over, Chairman Mao directed the speedboat towards the Young Pioneers. The Young Pioneers, seeing Chairman Mao, enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao smiled kindly and waved to them, saying, "Children, you are doing well!"

Chairman Mao's encouragement gave the children boundless strength. They braved the rolling waves and swam towards the finish line.

Among the swimming teams, Nei Changshen, a militiaman from the Hankou Power Plant, saw Chairman Mao and was so excited that he forgot he was swimming. He raised both hands and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" He jumped up and then sank down, swallowing a few mouthfuls of water. He felt the river water was especially sweet. Thus, five thousand swimmers passed by Chairman Mao in batches, continuously shouting "Long live Chairman Mao" and reaching the finish line in victory.

The swimmers landed on the shore at the finish line and turned around to cheer with tens of thousands of people, enthusiastically welcoming Chairman Mao on the speedboat in the river. The speedboat approached the shore, and Chairman Mao stood at the bow, continuously waving to everyone and shouting, "Long live the people!" The crowd on the shore became excited, and the earth-shaking cheers drowned out the sound of the rolling Yangtze River.

Just at this moment of joy and excitement, Chairman Mao's speedboat reached near the mouth of the Wuchang embankment. Chairman Mao, with steady steps, descended from the ship's ladder, first dipped into the water, and then stretched out his arms and swam freely. It was exactly 11:00 AM.

The Yangtze River in the flood season had rapid currents and rolling waves, crashing against the banks. Chairman Mao, on the vast river surface, sometimes swung his arms to the side, parting the layers of waves and advancing; sometimes he lay on his back, gazing at the boundless blue sky. Accompanying Chairman Mao in swimming were Wang Renzhong, the second secretary of the Central-South Bureau of the Communist Party and the first secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee, and a group of agile young men and women.

Chairman Mao, while swimming, chatted and laughed with the surrounding comrades. A young woman told Chairman Mao, "This is my second time swimming in the Yangtze River." Chairman Mao smiled and said to her, "The Yangtze River is wide and deep, it is a good place for swimming." Another young woman accompanying Chairman Mao could only swim in one posture. Chairman Mao noticed this and kindly taught her to swim on her back. Chairman Mao said, "The Yangtze River is deep and has strong currents, it can train the body and willpower."

In 1957, when Chairman Mao swam across the Yangtze River for the fourth time, he taught us: The Yangtze River, everyone says it is very big, but actually, being big is not scary. The American imperialists are very big, but we pushed them back a bit, and there was nothing to it. Therefore, some big things in the world are actually not scary.

While swimming, Chairman Mao also talked with Wang Renzhong beside him. Chairman Mao asked, "How is the swimming activity among Wuhan's youth?" Wang Renzhong said, "More and more young people are swimming. Their characteristics are: they are bold, brave, and learn quickly, generally they can swim after five or six days of practice." Chairman Mao then asked, "Out of three people, is one person able to swim?" Wang Renzhong replied, "Yes." Chairman Mao was pleased and said, "That's good!" Wang Renzhong also reported to Chairman Mao: Last year, the People's Liberation Army and the militia crossed the Yangtze River armed; students of Wuhan Water Conservancy and Electric Power Institute crossed the East Lake in winter, and more and more people know how to swim. The number of people who can swim across the Yangtze River is increasing every year.

In 1956, Chairman Mao swam across the Yangtze River for the first time, inspiring the masses. In recent years, millions of young people and the masses, following Chairman Mao's instruction, "Swimming is a struggle with nature, you should go to the great rivers and seas to train," have more widely carried out the activity of swimming across the river. At the first Yangtze River Swimming Competition, there were only about twenty female athletes, but now there are thousands in each competition, including female militia armed swimmers. At that time, only one child participated in crossing the river, but now they have become the vanguard; many children born after Chairman Mao's first swim across the Yangtze River have now become young swimmers.

Around noon, a five-level wind blew across the vast river surface, and the waves rolled. The speedboat waiting in the middle of the river approached Chairman Mao, ready to welcome him aboard. Wang Renzhong repeatedly invited Chairman Mao to rest. Chairman Mao asked, "How long have I swum?" The surrounding comrades said, "Forty-five minutes." Chairman Mao, full of enthusiasm, said, "It's not even an hour yet!" Then he continued to swim eastward. After swimming for one hour and five minutes, Wang Renzhong invited Chairman Mao to rest again. Chairman Mao humorously said, "You are the first secretary of the provincial committee here, I will follow your orders."

Chairman Mao swam from the mouth of the Wuchang embankment downstream to near the Wuhan Steel Company, covering nearly thirty li. When Chairman Mao boarded the speedboat, he was full of energy and showed no signs of fatigue.

The news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River inspired everyone's heart and brought great encouragement and strength to the people.

Wei Yue'an, a model in studying Chairman Mao's works in the Yangtze River navigation system and the leader of the 205th team of the Wuhan Port Bureau, returned to his team and reported to his comrades the grand scene of Chairman Mao inspecting the swimmers and swimming the Yangtze River. He said excitedly, "I, a dock worker who has lived on the water for decades, have suffered greatly in the old society. After liberation, the people have become the masters of the country. Today, I can swim the Yangtze River with Chairman Mao, which is truly unforgettable. In the future, I will definitely listen better to Chairman Mao's words, with my body on the Yangtze River, my heart for the motherland, and my eyes on the world, study and apply Chairman Mao's works thoroughly, carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat thoroughly, and work hard on production to build a great motherland and support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to repay the care of the Party and Chairman Mao."

In the ship management department of the Yangtze River navigation management bureau, more than three hundred workers and their families will never forget July 16th. Because on that day, they saw their beloved leader Chairman Mao in such good health and spirits, feeling limitless happiness. That afternoon, the workers wrote a large number of guarantee letters in the workshop, expressing their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, repair ships quickly, economically, and well, support national construction, support the Vietnamese people, and defeat American imperialism.

Liu Wucai, a worker swimmer from the Hankou Power Plant, made a vow when he saw Chairman Mao in the river: "Chairman Mao! I will definitely read your books better, like Comrade Liu Yingjun, strive to study the highest instructions, faithfully execute the highest instructions, enthusiastically propagate the highest instructions, and bravely defend the highest instructions." On the way back to the factory, Liu Wucai, full of passion, sang "The East is Red" with everyone. A Young Pioneer, after finishing the swim, with boundless happiness and immense excitement, took out his small notebook and wrote down the most unforgettable event of his life: "At 10:35 AM on July 16, 1966, I saw Chairman Mao."

Foreign friends visiting Wuhan to attend the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers saw their long-awaited great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, on this day when they watched the grand scene of the Wuhan masses swimming across the Yangtze River. At that time, the foreign friends cheered enthusiastically, and the yacht was in a state of excitement. The representatives from Niger had collectively written a poem in Beijing to express their love for Chairman Mao. They wrote: "Mao Zedong, you are our teacher, Mao Zedong, you are our lighthouse, illuminating the darkest and most distant horizons brightly, brightly..." Today, they saw Chairman Mao with their own eyes, how could they suppress their excitement! Some friends shouted repeatedly, "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!" Some shouted in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Some foreign friends clapped continuously on the ship. Friends from Indonesia, after seeing Chairman Mao, were extremely excited. They cheered continuously and sang revolutionary songs aloud.

Chairman Mao enthusiastically waved and clapped for the foreign friends. The foreign friends, seeing Chairman Mao in such good health, were very excited. Some foreign friends said, "Chairman Mao is in excellent health!" An African friend said, "Chairman Mao, at such an old age, swam across the Yangtze River. Chairman Mao's health and longevity are the happiness of the oppressed people of the world, the happiness of all people in the world!"

The foreign friends highly praised Chairman Mao's initiative to swim across the Yangtze River and his personal example, considering it a great event of great significance. They said, Chairman Mao led the way to swim across the Yangtze River, and the Chinese people launched a nationwide swimming movement. This is a great innovation, which shows the courage of the Chinese people and their fearlessness of any difficulties. Syrian representative Zadat Rikaibi said, "Today's athletes swimming across the Yangtze River are all strong, enthusiastic, and brave. Chairman Mao's excellent initiative can train young people's bodies and establish a good mentality, no matter how big the difficulties are, no matter how wide the rivers are, they can all be overcome." These friends said, the Yangtze River can be conquered, and any difficulties can be fearless. We see from here the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought!

Chairman Mao's feat of swimming nearly thirty li across the Yangtze River once again stirred everyone's heart. The cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao" continued for more than four hours on both banks of the Yangtze River. This moving scene expressed the boundless love and admiration of the Chinese people for the great leader Chairman Mao. Under the guidance of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, seven hundred million people open their eyes to the future and advance bravely, riding the winds and waves!

    毛主席畅游长江
    新华社武汉二十四日电　我们伟大的领袖毛主席，在一九六六年七月十六日，再一次乘风破浪，畅游长江。
    这一天，武汉晴空万里，长江两岸万众欢腾。
    十年前的六月，毛主席曾经三次在武汉横渡长江，并且写下了光辉豪迈的诗篇《水调歌头》（游泳）。十年后的今天，毛主席又在大江中遨游，历时一小时零五分，游程近三十华里，“不管风吹浪打，胜似闲庭信步”。
    毛主席再次畅游长江的喜讯，很快传遍了武汉。武汉全城男女老少，欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告：“我们敬爱的领袖毛主席这样健康，这是全中国人民的最大幸福！是全世界革命人民的最大幸福！”
    七月十六日上午，武汉市五千游泳健儿，遵循毛主席到大江大海去游泳去锻炼的教导，在毛主席开辟的航道上，热烈举行第十一届横渡长江游泳比赛。我们的伟大领袖在这个时候乘快艇检阅了参加比赛的游泳健儿，这给了武汉全体人民以无比巨大的鼓舞。
    七月十六日这一天，长江水面笑逐颜开，沿江两岸大地上，无数的彩旗，巨幅的标语，欢呼的人群，呈现出一片无比欢腾的节日景象。
    上午九时二十分，大江两岸的扩音器，播送出歌颂我们敬爱的领袖毛主席的乐曲《东方红》，激动着人们的心。人们想着：是毛主席为我们在长江上开辟了平坦大道，今天，毛主席要是能来看我们横渡长江，那该多好！
    毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，毛主席永远和我们在一起。就在比赛刚刚开始的时刻，从东方太阳升起的江面上，一艘快艇破浪驶来。这时，不知是游泳健儿中的哪一个，第一眼看见了快艇上的毛主席，立即情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席来了！毛主席万岁！”紧接着，游泳大军高举百面红旗，朝着毛主席的方向游了过去。在旗帜映红的江面上，在两岸江堤上，千千万万人的目光向着毛主席！千千万万人表达着同一个祝愿：伟大的毛主席万寿无疆！千千万万人发出了同一个心声：毛主席万岁！与此同时，停港的船舶，汽笛齐声长鸣，向伟大的领袖表示敬意。欢呼声、汽笛声汇成一片，震撼着武汉上空。
    毛主席红光满面，神采奕奕，在甲板上检阅正在与江水搏斗的游泳大军。这时，宽阔的江面上，健儿们有的高举红旗，有的推着高大的毛主席语录牌，组成一条水上长城，拨开千层波浪，奋勇前进。语录牌上写着：“团结、紧张、严肃、活泼。”“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席看到游泳健儿们这种意气风发、斗志昂扬的革命精神，十分高兴，一会儿走到快艇这一边，一会儿走到快艇那一边，在热烈的欢呼声中向大家频频招手，并高呼：“同志们好！同志们万岁！”
    由两百多名小学生组成的少年儿童游泳队伍，受到了毛主席特别的关怀。这批大多是八岁到十四岁的“红领巾”，簇拥着“好好学习，天天向上”的语录牌，齐唱《我们是共产主义接班人》，乘风破浪，努力前进，表现出毛泽东时代红色少年的革命气概。当孩子们游过来的时候，毛主席让快艇向少先队员们驶去。少先队员们看到了毛主席，热烈高呼：“毛主席万岁！”毛主席慈祥地微笑着，向他们招手，亲切地说：“少年们，你们好！”
    毛主席的鼓励，给孩子们增添了无限的力量，他们迎着滚滚波涛，游向终点。
    游泳队伍中的汉口火力发电厂民兵聂长燊见到了毛主席，兴奋得忘记了自己是在游泳，他举起双手高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”他跃起来又沉下去，喝了几口水，他觉得江水特别特别的甜。就是这样，五千游泳健儿分批从毛主席身边游过，连续高呼“毛主席万岁”，胜利到达终点。
    游泳健儿们登上比赛终点的江岸，掉转身来，和成千上万的群众一起，热烈地向江中快艇上的毛主席欢呼。快艇向岸边驶去，毛主席站在船头上，不断向大家招手，高呼“人民万岁！”岸上的人群沸腾起来了，震天动地的欢呼声，淹没了滚滚长江的风浪声。
    就在这人欢水笑、群情沸腾的时候，毛主席乘坐的快艇开到武昌大堤口附近。毛主席迈着稳健的步伐，从船舷的扶梯走下来，先在水里浸了一下，然后便伸开双臂畅游起来。这时是上午十一时整。
    汛期的长江，水流湍急，浪涛滚滚，拍打江岸。毛主席在浩瀚的江面上，时而挥臂侧游，拨开层层波涛，破浪前进；时而仰卧水面，看万里碧空。陪同游泳的中共中央中南局第二书记、湖北省委第一书记王任重同志，和一群矫健的男女青年，紧跟在毛主席身边。
    毛主席一面击浪前进，一面同周围的同志们谈笑风生。一位女青年告诉毛主席：“我这是第二次在长江里游泳了。”毛主席笑着对她说：“长江又宽、又深，是游泳的好地方。”陪同毛主席游泳的另一位女青年，只能游一种姿势，毛主席发现了，便亲切地教她仰游。毛主席说：“长江水深流急，可以锻炼身体，可以锻炼意志。”
    一九五七年，毛主席第四次横渡长江的时候，曾经教导过我们：长江，别人都说很大，其实，大，并不可怕。美帝国主义不是很大吗？我们顶了他一下，也没有啥。所以，世界上有些大的东西，其实并不可怕。
    毛主席在游泳时，还同身旁的王任重同志交谈起来。毛主席问：“武汉青少年游泳活动开展得怎样？”王任重同志说：“青少年游泳的越来越多。他们的特点是：胆子大，勇敢，学起来也快，一般学五六天就可以下水了。”毛主席又问：“三个人当中有一个人会游泳吗？”王任重同志回答：“有。”毛主席满意地说：“这很好！”王任重同志还向毛主席报告：去年人民解放军和民兵，武装泅渡过长江；武汉水利电力学院学生冬天横渡过武汉的东湖，会游水的人越来越多了。能够横渡长江的人也一年比一年多了。
    一九五六年，毛主席第一次横渡长江，鼓舞了广大群众。近几年来，千万青少年和广大群众遵循着毛主席“游泳是同大自然作斗争的一种运动，你们应该到大江大海去锻炼”的教导，更加广泛地开展了渡江游泳活动。第一届横渡长江时，女运动员只有二十多名，现在每届都有上千名，其中还有女民兵武装泅渡。那时，参加渡江的少年儿童只有一个，而现在他们已经成了渡江的先锋；许多在毛主席第一次横渡长江以后出生的儿童，如今也成了横渡长江的小将。
    将近十二点，辽阔的江面上刮起五级风，浩浩江面波涛滚滚。停候在江心的快艇向毛主席开来，准备迎接毛主席上船。王任重同志几次请毛主席上去休息。毛主席问：游了多少时间？周围同志说：四十五分钟了。毛主席兴致勃勃地说：“还不到一小时嘛！”接着又继续向东游去。游过一小时零五分，王任重同志再一次请毛主席上船休息。毛主席风趣地说：“你是这里的省委第一书记，我听你的命令。”
    毛主席从武昌大堤口顺流而下，一直游到武汉钢铁公司附近，游程将近三十华里。毛主席登上快艇的时候，精神焕发，毫无倦意。
    毛主席畅游长江的消息，振奋了每一个人的心，给人们带来了巨大的鼓舞和力量。
    长江航运系统学习毛主席著作标兵、武汉港务局二○五队指导员魏月安，回到队里以后，向同志们介绍了毛主席检阅游泳健儿并畅游长江的盛况，激动地说：“我这个在水上生活了几十年的码头工人，饱尝了旧社会的苦难。解放后，人民成了国家的主人，今天我能和毛主席同游长江，真使我终生难忘。今后我一定要更好地听毛主席的话，人在长江，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，活学活用毛主席著作，彻底搞好无产阶级文化大革命，搞好生产，为建设伟大祖国，为支援亚非拉人民反帝革命斗争作出贡献，来报答党和毛主席的关怀。”
    在长江航运管理局船舶管理部航修站，三百多名职工和家属永远忘不了七月十六日这一天。因为他们在这一天看到了敬爱的领袖毛主席身体这样健康，精神这样好，感到无限幸福。这一天下午，工人们就在车间里写了大批保证书，表示一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，多快好省地修好船，支援国家建设，支援越南人民，打败美帝国主义。
    汉口火力发电厂的工人游泳运动员刘武卿，在江心看到毛主席的时候，就发出了誓言：“毛主席！我一定要更好地读你的书，象刘英俊同志那样，努力地学习最高指示，忠实地执行最高指示，热情地宣传最高指示，勇敢地捍卫最高指示。”在回厂的路上，刘武卿满怀激情地和大家一起高唱《东方红》。一个少先队员在游泳完毕以后，怀着无限幸福和无比激动的心情，拿出小日记本，工工整整地写下了他一生最最难忘的一件事：“一九六六年七月十六日十时三十五分，我见到了毛主席。”
    到武汉访问的出席亚非作家紧急会议的各国朋友，在这一天乘船观看武汉群众横渡长江比赛的盛况时，他们会见了向往已久的中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席。当时，外国朋友们热烈欢呼，游轮上一片沸腾。尼日尔的代表在北京开会时，曾集体赋诗表达他们对毛主席热爱的心情。他们写道：“毛泽东，你是我们的导师，毛泽东，你是我们的灯塔，把最阴暗、最遥远的地平线，照耀得通亮、通亮。……”今天，他们亲眼看到了毛主席，怎能抑制激动的心情！有的朋友连声高呼：“毛主席！毛主席！”有的用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”有的外国朋友在船上不停地鼓掌。来自印度尼西亚的朋友们，看到毛主席以后，心情异常激动，他们不停地欢呼，并且放声高唱起革命歌曲。
    毛主席热情地向各国朋友们招手、鼓掌。外国朋友们看到毛主席是那样的健康，都非常兴奋。有的外国朋友说，“毛主席的身体好极了！”一位非洲朋友说：“毛主席这样大的年纪都渡过了长江，毛主席健康长寿，这是世界被压迫人民的幸福，是全世界人民的幸福！”
    外国朋友们对毛主席倡议横渡长江并身体力行，都极为称赞，认为这是一件具有伟大意义的事情。他们说，毛主席带头横渡长江，中国人民掀起全民性的游泳运动，这是一个伟大的创举，它显示了中国人民的勇气，不畏任何艰险。叙利亚代表扎达特·里卡比说：“今天横渡长江的运动员，个个都显得健壮、热情、勇敢。毛主席提出的这一非常好的倡议，可以使青年人锻炼身体，而且树立一个很好的思想，不管困难多大，江河有多宽，都能闯过去。”这些朋友们说，长江天险可以征服，任何困难都无所畏惧，我们从这里也看到了毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉！
    毛主席再一次踏破长江水、畅游天堑近三十华里的壮举，激荡着每一个人的心。“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声，在长江两岸一直持续了四个多小时。这动人的情景，表达了我国人民对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和敬仰，在光辉的毛泽东思想的指引下，七亿人民放开眼界看未来，乘风破浪向前进！　（附图片）
