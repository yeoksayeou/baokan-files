Edition: 5

Representatives from 53 countries and regions in Asia and Africa, totaling 161 people, along with five international organizations' observers, responded enthusiastically to the invitation from the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers and gathered in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, to attend the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers held from June 27 to July 9, 1966. The conference discussed the following agenda:

1. Supporting the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American imperialist aggression, to liberate the South, defend the North, and unify the country.
2. The tasks of writers in the struggle of Asian and African peoples against imperialism led by the United States, and in the struggle to achieve and maintain national independence.
3. Opposing cultural aggression by imperialism and old and new colonialism, and developing the national cultures of the peoples of Asian and African countries.

This conference, the most representative and largest of its kind in the two continents, was successfully held, effectively foiling the conspiracies of imperialism and its accomplices to sabotage the meeting.

The conference heard the general report from the Secretary-General of the Permanent Bureau, as well as two special reports on the Vietnam issue from the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The conference also heard several other sub-reports.

The conference expressed sincere gratitude to the leaders of various countries, political parties, trade unions, and people's organizations for their congratulatory and encouraging messages.

To respond promptly to the savage bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, the capital and port city of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and to express the deep indignation of the peoples of Asian and African countries, the conference issued an urgent appeal. The appeal strongly condemned the banditry of American imperialism and resolutely supported the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. The conference believed that since American imperialism has further escalated the war of aggression, the peoples of all countries have the right to support the Vietnamese people in every way possible.

The conference unanimously adopted a resolution on the Vietnam issue, fully endorsing and unconditionally supporting the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The conference believed that these are the only correct positions to resolve the Vietnam issue. The conference simultaneously called on the peoples of Asia and Africa to expose and condemn the various "peace talks" deceptions of American imperialism and its accomplices. The conference believed that the stance of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in rejecting the so-called "peace talks" of American imperialism is completely just.

The conference called on the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the people of the world, to do their utmost to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. This support should continue and be strengthened until the American aggressors are thoroughly defeated and completely driven out of Vietnam.

The conference also adopted a series of resolutions, resolutely supporting the struggles of the peoples of Asian and African countries against imperialism and colonialism led by the United States, Britain, France, Portugal, Spain, and Belgium, against racism and Zionism, and for the achievement and maintenance of national independence. The conference fully supported the armed struggles and all forms of patriotic struggles against imperialism led by the United States in Laos, Thailand, Malaysia (including Singapore), North Kalimantan, Indonesia, Kashmir, and other places in Asia; in Palestine, occupied South Yemen, Oman, and other Arab countries divided and re-divided by imperialism; and in Congo (Leopoldville), Angola, Mozambique, Niger, "Portuguese" Guinea, Ghana, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Azania, Basutoland, and other African countries divided by imperialism.

The conference unanimously agreed that the current main task of the peoples of Asia and Africa is to thoroughly sweep away the forces and influences of imperialism and colonialism in the political, economic, and cultural spheres, and to carry the struggle for national liberation to the end.

The conference emphasized that American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and of the people of the world. Therefore, the urgent task of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and of the people of the world, is to form a genuine and powerful international united front to eliminate these evil forces, namely, American imperialism and its accomplices. The writers of Asia and Africa are determined to make their greatest contribution to this united front against American imperialism.

The conference believed that the writers of Asia and Africa must defend, create, develop, and enrich their national cultures. Therefore, they should immediately create a new culture and literature that is anti-imperialist, revolutionary, and for the people and the nation, and wage unremitting struggles against all imperialist, old and new colonialist, and other reactionary and decadent cultures and literatures. The writers of Asia and Africa believe that fulfilling this resolve is their sacred duty, and they will dedicate their works to the struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

To safeguard and defend the movement of Asian and African writers and to oppose the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and its accomplices, the conference supported the solemn declaration issued by the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers on June 23, 1966, condemning the split conference. The conference believed that all the illegal decisions made by the split conference, including the decision to hold a so-called Asian and African Writers Conference in Baku, are acts of splitting the unity of Asian and African writers and undermining the united anti-imperialist struggle of all the peoples of Asia and Africa.

The conference strongly supported the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers meeting in Beijing and declared that before the convening of the Third Congress, the Permanent Bureau is the only body responsible for the administration and activities of Asian and African writers.

The conference preemptively condemned all possible conspiracies and attempts to split before the next congress.

To further strengthen the movement of Asian and African writers and the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers, and to make the greatest contribution to the struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa, the conference decided that the Third Congress of Asian and African Writers will be held in the People's Republic of China.

    我们两大洲这类会议中最有代表性、规模空前的这次会议的胜利召开有力地粉碎了帝国主义及其帮凶蓄意破坏会议的阴谋。
    会议听取了常设局秘书长的总报告，听取了越南民主共和国代表团和越南南方民族解放阵线代表团所作的关于越南问题的两个特别报告，还听取了其他几个分报告。
    会议热诚感谢各国首脑，政治、工会及人民团体所发来的致贺和鼓励的文电。
    为了对越南民主共和国的首都河内和海防市所遭到的狂轰滥炸及时作出反应，并表达亚非各国人民的无比愤慨，会议发出了一个紧急呼吁书，强烈谴责美帝国主义的这种强盗行径，坚决支持越南兄弟的正义斗争。会议认为，既然美帝国主义进一步扩大了侵略战争，各国人民就有一切权利以他们所能使用的各种方式支援越南人民。
    会议一致通过了一项关于越南问题的决议，完全赞同并无保留地支持越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，认为它们是解决越南问题的唯一正确的立场。会议同时号召亚非人民揭露和谴责美帝国主义及其帮凶的形形色色的“和谈”骗局。会议认为越南民主共和国和越南南方民族解放阵线拒绝美帝国主义的所谓“和平谈判”的立场是完全正义的。
    会议号召亚非拉人民和全世界人民，尽其所能大力支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。这种支持应当继续下去并且不断加强，直到美国侵略者被彻底打垮，并且被全部赶出越南。
    会议还通过了一系列决议，坚决支持亚非各国人民反对以美国为首的英国、法国、葡萄牙、西班牙和比利时帝国主义和新老殖民主义，反对种族主义和犹太复国主义，争取和维护民族独立的斗争。会议全力支持在老挝、泰国、马来亚（包括新加坡）、北加里曼丹、印度尼西亚、克什米尔和亚洲其他地方的反对以美国为首的帝国主义的武装斗争和其他一切形式的爱国斗争；全力支持在巴勒斯坦、被占领的南也门、阿曼和其他被帝国主义分割及再分割的阿拉伯国家的反对以美国为首的帝国主义的武装斗争和其他一切形式的爱国斗争；全力支持在刚果（利）、安哥拉、莫三鼻给、尼日尔、“葡属”几内亚、加纳、马尔加什、津巴布韦、阿扎尼亚、巴苏陀兰和南部非洲其他被分割的国家中的反对以美国为首的帝国主义的武装斗争和其他一切形式的爱国斗争。

    会议强调指出，美帝国主义是亚非拉人民和全世界人民的最凶恶的敌人。因此，亚非拉和全世界人民的迫切任务在于结成真实的和强大的国际统一战线，以便消灭这些邪恶势力，即：美帝国主义及其帮凶。亚非作家们决心要为这个反对美帝国主义的统一战线作出自己最大的贡献。
    会议认为，亚非作家必须捍卫、创造、发展和丰富他们的民族文化。因此，他们应该立即创造反帝革命的、人民大众的、民族的新文化和新文艺，与一切帝国主义、新老殖民主义及其他反动腐朽的文化和文艺进行不懈的斗争。亚非作家认为实现这种决心是自己的神圣任务，并将把自己的作品贡献给亚非人民的斗争。
    为了维护和保卫亚非作家运动和反对帝国主义及其帮凶的阴谋诡计，会议支持亚非作家常设局于一九六六年六月二十三日谴责分裂会议的庄严声明。会议认为，分裂会议所作出的一切非法决定，包括关于在巴库举行一个所谓亚非作家会议的决定，都是破坏亚非作家团结和破坏全体亚非人民团结反帝事业的行为。
