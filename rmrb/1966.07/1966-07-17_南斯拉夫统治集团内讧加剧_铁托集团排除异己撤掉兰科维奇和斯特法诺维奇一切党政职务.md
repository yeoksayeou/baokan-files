	Yugoslavia's ruling clique has seen a sharp escalation in internal conflicts. The Tito faction has removed Aleksandar Rankovic, Secretary of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and Vice President, and his close associate, Stevan Stefanovic, a member of the Central Committee of the League of Communists and Chairman of the Federal Executive Council's Interior Committee, from all party and government positions. Stefanovic has also been expelled from the League of Communists.

	This is the result of further exacerbation of Yugoslavia's political and economic crises.

	According to reports, after careful planning, the Tito faction convened the Fourth Plenum of the League of Communists on July 1st, using a surprise attack to oust Rankovic and Stefanovic from the leadership of the League. Subsequently, the Yugoslav Parliament removed Stefanovic and Rankovic from their administrative posts on July 6th and 14th, respectively.

	According to materials published in Yugoslav newspapers, the Tito faction accused Rankovic and his group of fostering personal loyalties, forming "factional groups," establishing an "alternative political platform," opposing the "line of the League of Communists," engaging in a "struggle for power," and placing police and intelligence organizations under their control, above the League of Communists and society. They were also accused of abusing their power, installing eavesdropping devices, and listening to the conversations of Tito and others. According to Yugoslav newspaper reports, both Rankovic and Stefanovic denied these accusations.

	The infighting and power struggles within the Yugoslav revisionist ruling clique have been ongoing for some time. Tito mentioned in the Fourth Plenum that this struggle is not "new," but has been ongoing for a decade. In March 1962, the Enlarged Meeting of the Central Committee of the League of Communists discussed the issue of "relationships among leaders." Now, this struggle for power has resurfaced in a more intense and serious form. The internal strife exposed at the Fourth Plenum of the League of Communists indicates that the severe difficulties and crises in politics, economics, and other areas, resulting from the restoration of capitalism in Yugoslavia, have sparked strong dissatisfaction among the Yugoslav people. This has intensified the contradictions among different interest groups within the new bourgeois privileged class. At the same time, intertwined with the conflicts of interest among these groups are the further deterioration of national contradictions within the country.

	The power struggles within the Tito revisionist ruling clique will not end with Rankovic's removal. In his speech at the plenary session, Tito declared that there would be a "reorganization and purge" of the League of Communists and the state security apparatus. He said that not only would the leadership of the Central Committee of the League of Communists be "reorganized," but also the leadership of the League of Communists in the federal republics and the "examination of cadres." The plenary session also established a special committee to study the issue of convening an "extraordinary congress" of the League of Communists.

　　南斯拉夫统治集团内讧加剧
　　铁托集团排除异己撤掉兰科维奇和斯特法诺维奇一切党政职务
    新华社十六日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫修正主义统治集团内部矛盾最近急剧发展，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会书记、副总统兰科维奇和他的亲信南共联盟中央委员、联邦执行委员会内务委员会主席斯特法诺维奇被解除了一切党政职务，斯特法诺维奇并被开除出南共联盟。
    这是南斯拉夫国内政治、经济危机进一步激化的结果。
    据报道，铁托集团经过周密部署后，在七月一日召开共产主义者联盟四中全会，用突然袭击的手段把兰科维奇和斯特法诺维奇从联盟的领导集团中赶出去。紧接着，南斯拉夫议会先后在七月六日和十四日解除了斯特法诺维奇和兰科维奇的行政职务。
    据南斯拉夫报刊公布的材料，铁托集团指责兰科维奇及其一伙是：培植亲信，私组“宗派集团”，另立“政治纲领”，“反对南共联盟的路线”，进行“争夺权利的斗争”，把他所领导的内务和保安等警察和特务组织“置于南共联盟和社会之上”，并且“滥用职权”，安装窃听器，窃听铁托等人的讲话。据南斯拉夫报刊报道，兰科维奇和斯特法诺维奇都拒绝了上述指责。
    南斯拉夫修正主义统治集团内部勾心斗角、争权夺利的斗争由来已久。铁托在四中全会上说，这一斗争不是“最新的事情”，而在十年前就已开始了。一九六二年三月，南共联盟中央委员会扩大会议曾经讨论过“领导人的关系”问题，现在这种争夺权利的斗争“又重新以更激烈更严重的形式出现了”。南共联盟四中全会上所暴露出来的统治集团的内讧表明：南斯拉夫由于资本主义复辟而在政治、经济等方面出现的严重困难和危机，引起了南斯拉夫广大人民的强烈不满，促使了南斯拉夫新兴资产阶级特权阶层中不同利益集团之间的矛盾日益尖锐化。同时，同这些集团的利害冲突交织在一起的，是国内民族矛盾的进一步恶化。
    铁托修正主义统治集团内部的争权夺利的斗争，没有、也不可能以兰科维奇的下台而告终。铁托在全会讲话中宣称，要对南共联盟和国家保安部门进行“改组和清洗”。他说，不仅要“改组”南共联盟中央的“领导”，还要
  “改组”联邦各共和国共产主义者联盟的“领导”和“审查干部”。全会还成立了一个专门委员会，研究召开南共联盟“非常代表大会”的问题。
