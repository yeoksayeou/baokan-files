Pakistani representative Shoakat Siddiqui today announced at the plenary session of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers that the Pakistani people fully support the liberation struggle of the freedom-loving people and patriots of Vietnam. We will always stand with the Vietnamese people.

He said, only the Vietnamese people can decide the fate of Vietnam. The final victory will surely belong to the Vietnamese people.

In his speech, Shoakat Siddiqui enthusiastically paid tribute to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. He said, Mao Zedong is the reliance of the oppressed and enslaved peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the center of hope for all the peoples of the world. Mao Zedong is the greatest person of the contemporary era, the brilliant torch of human destiny. Today, Mao Zedong is not just a name; he is the symbol of freedom and liberation. His theories and thoughts have added new luster to wisdom, and he has lit the lamp that brings light and warmth to humanity today. When we mention this great people's leader, the one billion people of Pakistan feel proud.

He praised Beijing as the center of government of a great nation. He said, here, the socialist revolution is experiencing a successful course and is advancing towards its great goals. We are pleased that the friendship between the peoples of Pakistan and China is increasingly consolidated and deepened. We guarantee that in every struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism, the one billion people of Pakistan and the seven hundred million people of China will stand shoulder to shoulder.

He spoke about the history of the anti-imperialist struggle of the Pakistani people and the struggle of the Kashmiri people for freedom and liberation. He condemned the Indian ruling clique for shamelessly declaring Kashmir to be an inseparable part of India. He said, all freedom-loving people of Asia and Africa and all just and revolutionary writers will surely give full support to the struggle of the Kashmiri people for the right to self-determination.

He finally expressed his support for the third Conference of Asian and African Writers to be held in Beijing.

    肖卡特·西迪基在发言中满腔热情地向中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席致敬。他说，毛泽东主席是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲被压迫被奴役人民的依靠，是全世界人民希望的中心。毛泽东是当代最伟大的人，是人类前途的光辉火炬，毛泽东今天不是一个人的名字，他是自由和解放的象征。他的学说和思想使智慧增加了新的光彩，他点亮了人类今天得到光明和热量的明灯。当我们提这位伟大的人民领袖时，巴基斯坦一亿人民都为之感到自豪。
