Cotton plants across the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are growing vigorously. In the Turpan Basin, cotton buds have already begun to form. Currently, commune members and farm workers are strengthening field management to strive for another bumper cotton harvest this year.

This spring, Xinjiang experienced a late frost, delaying the cotton sowing time. In the southern part of Xinjiang, sowing was delayed by 10 days to half a month compared to previous years. However, due to thorough preparation for sowing, most areas completed sowing within seven days. Additionally, due to good field management, each mu generally has more than 6,000 seedlings, with uniform and robust growth. This year, not only is the quality of cotton sowing good in various places in Xinjiang, but the area of cotton fields has also increased compared to last year.

    新疆各地棉株生长茁壮
    新疆维吾尔自治区各地棉株长势很好，吐鲁番盆地棉蕾已含苞初放。公社社员和农场职工目前正加强田间管理工作，力争今年棉花再丰收。
    新疆今年春寒，棉花播种时间推迟，南疆各地比往年晚了十天到半个月。但是由于备耕工作做得充分，大部分地区七天就播完了。并且由于田间管理工作做得好，一般每亩保苗六千株以上，苗全苗匀，棉株茁壮喜人。今年新疆各地的棉花不仅播种质量好，棉田面积也比去年增加。
