I studied for over two years, learned a few characters, and for many years was addicted to reading old novels. After reading them, I followed their teachings: things like "be content with your lot," "submit to fate," "kneel more, speak less" ... and so on. I muddled through life like this for half my life. Chairman Mao's books awakened me, making me understand that this is a wrong ideology that does not distinguish between classes or between enemies and ourselves. From studying Chairman Mao's works, I also came to realize that being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. This way, I dare to expose and struggle against bad people and bad things. In the future, for the revolution, I will fight against all phenomena that are not beneficial to socialism. The poor and lower-middle peasants elected me as the head of the poor peasants' association, and I will not let down the people's trust. Now, whenever I think of the revolution, I am happy to do anything.

    我敢于揭发和斗争坏人坏事了
    贫协组长　杨树泉
    我念了二年多的书，认识几个字，多年来读旧小说入了迷。读了，也就照着去做，什么“安分守己”啦，“顺时听天”啦，“多磕头、少说话”啦……就这么混混沌沌过了半辈子。毛主席的书，唤醒了我，使我懂得了这是不分阶级、不分敌我的错误思想。我从学习毛主席著作中还认识到被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。这样，我就敢于揭发和斗争坏人坏事了。今后为了革命，我要和一切不利于社会主义的现象作斗争。贫下中农选我当贫协组长，我决不辜负人民的重托。现在，我一想到为革命，干啥事也高兴。
