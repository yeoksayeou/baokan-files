Highly raising the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (commonly known as the Anti-Japanese University) is the most advanced, revolutionary, and progressive school established under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Thirty years ago, our country was on the eve of the great Anti-Japanese National Revolutionary War. To meet the new situation of the revolutionary struggle and to cultivate a large number of anti-Japanese, revolutionary, and strong cadres, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao established the Chinese Anti-Japanese Red Army University in Wa Yaobang, Shaanxi, in June 1936. In early 1937, it was renamed the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and Political University and moved to Yan'an, the holy land of the Chinese revolution. As the revolutionary situation developed, twelve branches of the Anti-Japanese University were established in various anti-Japanese base areas. From 1936 to 1945, the main campus and branches of the Anti-Japanese University trained more than ten million cadres who were loyal to the Party, the people, and the cause of proletarian liberation. They made great contributions to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the Chinese People's Revolutionary War.

The Anti-Japanese University is a revolutionary school established entirely according to Chairman Mao's educational thoughts, serving as a model for proletarian education. The most glorious tradition of the Anti-Japanese University is to highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics, use Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks, learn, implement, and spread Mao Zedong Thought, and arm all revolutionary cadres with Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao personally served as the chairman of the Anti-Japanese University Education Committee, gave lectures and reports, and appointed Comrade Lin Biao as the president and political commissar. Chairman Mao personally formulated the educational policy of the Anti-Japanese University: firm and correct political direction, hardworking and frugal work style, flexible and mobile strategies and tactics. The school spirit of the Anti-Japanese University is: unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness. The educational center of the Anti-Japanese University is political education, aiming to raise proletarian consciousness. The teaching principle of the Anti-Japanese University is to connect theory with practice, be concise and precise, and short and few. The teaching method of the Anti-Japanese University is to combine inspiration, research, and practice. The faculty and students of the Anti-Japanese University, following Chairman Mao's instructions, inherited the glorious tradition of the Red Army's hard work and overcoming difficulties, and implemented the combination of education and productive labor. They worked hard to study while persisting in production, digging caves, building school buildings, cultivating land, planting vegetables, spinning and weaving. The students of each term of the Anti-Japanese University, in this revolutionary furnace, learned the theories and practical experiences of revolutionary struggle, transformed non-proletarian thoughts, gradually established a great revolutionary ideal and proletarian worldview, and cultivated a brave, firm, calm, and selfless revolutionary spirit. After only half a year to eight months of study, they rushed to the front lines of the Anti-Japanese War, directly participated in the fight against the enemy, and continued to learn, temper, and improve in actual struggles. Thus, the Anti-Japanese University cultivated and trained a large number of revolutionary talents for the cause of liberation of the Chinese people.

The tradition of the Anti-Japanese University is a glorious tradition of proletarian education in our country. In the current great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Anti-Japanese University is of great significance. We must highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly expose and criticize those anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois representatives who have usurped the educational front, thoroughly settle accounts with and uproot the bourgeois and revisionist black lines in the educational field. We must inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the Anti-Japanese University, and turn all schools in the country into truly Anti-Japanese University-style schools, cultivating a large number of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and making new contributions to the proletarian revolution in our country and the world revolution.

	Anti-Japanese University was established under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Our beloved leader Chairman Mao has often personally come to the Anti-Japanese University to give lectures and reports. Important works such as "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," "On Practice," and "On Contradiction" have all been lectured by Chairman Mao at the Anti-Japanese University.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    最新型、最革命、最进步的学校
    ——中国人民抗日军事政治大学介绍
    中国人民抗日军事政治大学（简称抗大），是在党中央和毛主席直接领导下创办的最新型、最革命、最进步的学校。三十年前，我国正处在伟大的抗日民族革命战争的前夜，为了迎接革命斗争的新形势，造就大批抗日的、革命的坚强干部，党中央、毛主席于一九三六年六月，在陕北革命根据地的瓦窑堡，创办了中国抗日红军大学。一九三七年初，改名为中国人民抗日军政大学，并迁至延安这个中国革命的圣地。以后随着革命形势的发展，各抗日根据地先后建立了十二所抗大分校。从一九三六年到一九四五年，抗大总校、分校共培养了十余万忠于党、忠于人民、忠于无产阶级解放事业的革命干部，对抗日战争和中国人民革命战争的胜利，作出了伟大的贡献。
    抗大，是完全按照毛主席的教育思想办起来的革命化的学校，是无产阶级教育事业的样板。抗大的光荣传统，最核心的就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，以毛主席著作为基本教材，学习毛泽东思想，贯彻毛泽东思想，传播毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装广大革命干部。毛主席亲自兼任抗大教育委员会主席，亲自讲课作报告，并选派林彪同志担任校长兼政治委员。毛主席亲手制定的抗大的教育方针是：坚定正确的政治方向，艰苦朴素的工作作风，灵活机动的战略战术。抗大的校风是：团结、紧张、严肃、活泼。抗大的教育中心是政治教育，提高人的无产阶级觉悟。抗大的教学原则是理论与实际相联系，少而精，短而少。抗大的教学方法是启发、研究和实践相结合。抗大教职学员遵照毛主席的指示，继承红军艰苦奋斗、克服困难的光荣传统，实行教育与生产劳动相结合，一面努力学习，一面坚持生产，自己动手挖窑洞，建校舍，开荒种菜，纺纱织布。抗大各期学员，在这所革命的熔炉里，学习革命斗争的理论和实际经验，改造非无产阶级思想，逐步树立起远大的革命理想和无产阶级世界观，培养起勇敢、坚定、沉着、不怕牺牲的革命精神。他们只经过半年至八个月的学习，便奔赴抗日战争的最前线，直接参加对敌斗争，并在实际斗争中继续学习、锻炼和提高。抗大就这样为中国人民的解放事业培养和造就了大批革命人材。
    抗大的传统，是我国无产阶级教育事业的光荣传统。在当前伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，纪念抗大建校三十周年是有重大意义的。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底揭露和批判那些窃踞在教育阵地上的反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物，彻底清算和挖掉教育事业中资产阶级和修正主义的黑线。我们一定要继承和发扬抗大的光荣传统，把全国所有院校都办成真正抗大式的学校，造就大批用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命事业接班人，为我国无产阶级革命和世界革命作出新的贡献。
