Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, after holding talks with Soviet leaders to plot the reconvening of the Geneva Conference, held a press conference in New Delhi on July 19, where she extensively promoted her "peace" initiatives on the Vietnam issue. She also revealed that Indian diplomatic missions are "actively promoting" this deception. In the midst of U.S. imperialism's "bombing for negotiations" evil activities, the Indian Prime Minister once again stepped forward, acting as a very active go-between.

Before her visit to the Soviet Union, the Indian Prime Minister had already put forward her so-called "seven-point proposal" to end the Vietnam War. The joint statement from the Sino-Indian talks also proposed "stopping the bombing" and "resolving the Vietnam issue within the framework of the Geneva Agreement," and demanded that "all governments abandon the use of force," among other things. Its tune is completely in line with the "seven-point proposal" of the Indian reactionaries.

"Stopping the bombing" is originally a slogan serving U.S. imperialism's war extortion policy. Now, after the Johnson administration dropped bombs on the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, what does this slogan mean? Isn't this blatantly advocating that as long as the U.S. aggressors stop bombing, the Vietnamese people should kneel and seek peace, a logic of bandits?

The Geneva Agreement has been torn to shreds by U.S. imperialism. At this time, to talk so much about resolving the Vietnam issue according to this agreement is sheer nonsense. To have the Vietnamese people sit down with U.S. imperialism to discuss how to "maintain" an agreement that no longer exists is not the most shameless betrayal of the national interests of the 31 million Vietnamese people?

The Sino-Indian joint statement also openly proposed that "all governments abandon the use of force." I ask, in the Vietnam issue, apart from U.S. imperialism, who else must "abandon the use of force"? They spread such arguments, which is openly threatening the Vietnamese people to stop resisting and surrender. The successors of the "three Ns company" are doing such a blatant joint action, isn't it too obvious?

It is worth noting that recently, the Johnson administration's blatant bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong has been universally condemned by the just public opinion of the world. It is precisely in this context that the Indian Prime Minister proposed the so-called "seven-point proposal" and then rushed to Moscow for talks, so unabashed, so hardworking, what is the purpose? Originally, on the day after the Indian Prime Minister proposed the so-called "seven-point proposal," the United States immediately granted India a loan of 150 million U.S. dollars. The Soviet revisionist leadership group also agreed to provide 1 billion rubles as a reward before this. This is truly "great rewards, brave men."

Gandhi's visit to Moscow not only exposed the ugly face of the Indian reactionaries to the world, but also further exposed the traitorous nature of the Soviet revisionist leadership group. In her moment of triumph, the Indian Prime Minister boasted at the press conference in New Delhi, but she revealed the tracks of her second boss. She said, "People welcome (India's) this proposal," "I do not believe" that the Soviet leaders "want to give up" the initiative of "peace talks." No matter how many times Moscow "denies" on the left and "denies" on the right, the Indian Prime Minister's words have once again exposed the joint action of the U.S.-Soviet collusion to "bomb for negotiations."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Nation" is a powerful rebuttal to U.S. imperialism's war extortion policy and a blow to the head of all kinds of "peace talk" go-betweens. The Indian reactionaries are running around for the Johnson administration's "peace talk" conspiracy, which will never shake the iron will of the 31 million Vietnamese people to fight to the final victory. The result can only be to expose their true colors and make themselves stink more and more on the international political stage.

    原形毕露
    本报评论员
    印度总理甘地夫人在同苏联领导人举行会谈，策划重新召开日内瓦会议的阴谋之后，七月十九日在新德里举行记者招待会，大肆鼓吹她在越南问题上的“和平”倡议，并透露印度驻外使团“正在积极地推行”这个骗局。在美帝国主义“以炸迫和”的罪恶活动中，印度总理又一次抛头露面，充当一名十分活跃的掮客。
    印度总理在访苏之前，就已经抛出了所谓结束越南战争的“七点建议”。苏印会谈的联合公报也提出了“停止轰炸”，“在日内瓦协议的范围内”解决越南问题，还要求“所有的政府放弃使用武力”，等等。它的调调儿同印度反动派的“七点建议”完全一致。
    “停止轰炸”，原来就是为美帝国主义战争讹诈政策效劳的口号。现在，当约翰逊政府把炸弹扔到越南民主共和国首都河内之后，这个口号又意味什么呢？这岂不是明目张胆地鼓吹，只要美国侵略者一停炸，越南人民就应该屈膝求和的强盗逻辑吗？
    日内瓦协议已经被美帝国主义撕得粉碎了，在这个时候还要大谈特谈按照这个协议来解决越南问题，不是活见鬼吗？要越南人民同美帝国主义坐在一起，讨论什么“维护”早已不存在的这个协议，这不是对三千一百万越南人民的民族利益最无耻的出卖吗？
    苏印公报中还公然提出“所有的政府放弃使用武力”。试问，在越南问题上，除了美帝国主义应该立即停止侵略战争以外，还有谁必须“放弃使用武力”呢？他们散布这种论调，就是公然胁迫越南人民停止抵抗，屈膝投降。“三尼公司”的继任者们的这种联合行动，不是做得太露骨了吗？
    值得注意的是，最近，约翰逊政府悍然轰炸河内、海防这一罪行遭到了世界公正舆论的普遍谴责。正是在这种情况下，印度总理却一会儿提出所谓“七点建议”，一会儿又赶到莫斯科去进行会谈，如此不避嫌疑，如此大卖力气，这是所为何来呢？原来在印度总理提出所谓“七点建议”的第二天，美国就立即赐给印度一亿五千万美元的贷款。苏联修正主义领导集团在这之前，也答应拿出十亿卢布来作为酬劳。这真是“重赏之下，必有勇夫”。
    甘地夫人的莫斯科之行，不仅把印度反动派丑恶嘴脸公诸于世，也进一步暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团的叛徒面目。印度总理得意之余，在新德里的记者招待会上为自己吹牛的时候，却露出了她的二老板的马脚。她说，“人们欢迎（印度）这个建议”，“我不相信”苏联领导人“想放弃”搞“和谈”的“主动”。不管莫斯科左一个“辟谣”，右一个“辟谣”，印度总理的这一番话，又一次拆穿了苏美串通一气搞“以炸迫和”的联合行动的西洋镜。
    胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》，是对美帝国主义战争讹诈政策的有力回击，也是对形形色色的“和谈”掮客的当头一棒。印度反动派为约翰逊政府的“和谈”阴谋奔波效劳，绝不可能动摇三千一百万越南人民坚决战斗直到最后胜利的钢铁意志。其结果只能使自己原形毕露，在国际政治舞台上越搞越臭。
