The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association issued a statement on July 21, firmly supporting Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" issued on July 17 and the enthusiastic response of the entire Vietnamese people to this letter. The statement said: "The Asian-African journalists and the people of various countries who resolutely oppose imperialism led by the United States and the old and new colonialism have drawn immense inspiration from the resolve of the Vietnamese people."

The statement said: "The 'Letter to All Compatriots' and the resolute response of the Vietnamese people are a heavy blow to the war escalation and the 'peace talks' deception tactics played by the American imperialists and their accomplices."

The statement said: "The Asian-African journalists unreservedly support all measures that the Vietnamese people may take to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors."

The statement pointed out: "The United States is the sole violator of the 1954 Geneva Accords. It has intervened in and invaded Vietnam, tearing the accord to shreds. Now, any attempt to forcibly reconvene the Geneva Conference or to 'solve' the Vietnamese problem on the basis of the Geneva Accords, as the Soviet leaders and the Indian reactionaries are currently hastily trying to do, is in fact just a variant of Johnson's 'peace talks' deception."

The statement said: "Unless the American aggressors withdraw from Vietnam completely, there can be no peace in Vietnam, no reconvening of the Geneva Conference, and no talk of the Geneva Accords. The Vietnamese problem can only be solved according to the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam."

The statement concluded by expressing the firm belief that "the Vietnamese people will surely win, and American imperialism and its accomplices will surely be defeated, just as dawn will surely come after the night."

    亚非记协书记处支持越南人民打败美国侵略者
    胡志明主席文告是对美帝及其帮凶的沉重打击
    新华社二十一日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处二十一日发表声明，坚决支持胡志明主席七月十七日发表的《告全国同胞书》和全体越南人民对这一文告的热烈响应。声明说：“亚非新闻工作者和坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的各国人民，从越南人民的决心中得到了无限的鼓舞。”
    声明说：“《告全国同胞书》以及越南人民的坚决响应，是对美帝国主义者及其帮凶所玩弄的战争升级和‘和谈’骗局的两面手法的沉重打击。”
    声明说：“亚非新闻工作者无保留地支持越南人民为了彻底打败美国侵略者而可能采取的一切措施。”
    声明指出：“美国是一九五四年日内瓦协议的唯一破坏者，它在越南进行干涉和侵略，早已把这个协议撕得粉碎。现在要强行重新召开日内瓦会议或者说什么以日内瓦协议为基础来‘解决’越南问题的任何企图，就象苏联领导人和印度反动派当前正在急急忙忙联合游说的那样，事实上只是约翰逊‘和谈’骗局的变种。”
    声明说：“除非美国侵略者一个不留地撤出越南，否则就不可能在越南实现和平，也不可能重新召开日内瓦会议，也谈不上日内瓦协议。只能按照越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明来解决越南问题。”
    声明最后表示深信，“越南人民必胜，美帝国主义及其帮凶必败，就象黑夜之后黎明必将到来一样。”
