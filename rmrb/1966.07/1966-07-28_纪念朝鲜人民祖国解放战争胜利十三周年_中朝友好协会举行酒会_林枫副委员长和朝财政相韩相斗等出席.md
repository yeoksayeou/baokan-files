The Chinese-Korean Friendship Association held a reception tonight to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the victory of the Korean People's War of National Liberation.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the Chinese-Korean Friendship Association Lin Feng, and other relevant leaders such as Yang Yong, Han Nianlong, Chu Tuonan, Li Qiang, Ding Xilin, Li Yingji, and Wang Chuanbin attended the reception.

The acting charge d'affaires of the Korean Embassy in China, Kim Jaesuk, and embassy officials, as well as Korean students and trainees in Beijing, were invited to attend the reception.

Kim Youngnam, the Korean Minister of Finance, who passed through Beijing after participating in the celebrations of the 45th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim Yongnam were also invited to attend the reception.

Vice President of the Chinese-Korean Friendship Association Wei Chuantong spoke at the reception. He first extended warm congratulations to the fraternal Korean people. He said that the victory of the Korean people's just struggle against American imperialism has fully demonstrated to the oppressed peoples and nations of the world that as long as the revolutionary people dare to fight and dare to win, American imperialism and its running dogs will be burned to ashes in the flames of people's war.

Wei Chuantong condemned the obstruction of Korean unification and the occupation of South Korea by American imperialism. He said that the Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Korean people and firmly believe that the heroic Korean people, with the strong support of the people of the world, will definitely drive the American aggressors out of their own territory and achieve the unification of Korea. He also exposed the collusion between the Soviet modern revisionists and American imperialism on the Vietnam issue. He pointed out that this is the most open and shameless betrayal of the Vietnamese people.

Wei Chuantong said that the Chinese people firmly support the steadfast position of the heroic Vietnamese people. We firmly endorse Chairman Liu Shaoqi's solemn declaration. The 700 million Chinese people are determined to be the rear guard of the Vietnamese people. He concluded by saying that the Chinese people will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely unite with the fraternal Korean people and the Vietnamese people, and unite closely with the revolutionary people of the world to resolutely carry the struggle against American imperialism and its accomplices to the end.

Kim Jaesuk, the acting charge d'affaires, said at the reception that the Korean people were not alone in their just war against the American imperialist invaders. The fraternal Chinese people, in the most difficult times of our people, raised the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, sent their finest sons to the front lines of Korea, and aided the Korean people with their blood. He expressed that the Korean people will never forget the heroic deeds and images of the Chinese People's Volunteers who fought bravely on the highlands and in the villages of Korea.

Kim Jaesuk condemned the continued occupation of South Korea by American imperialism and the introduction of Japanese militarism into South Korea.

Kim Jaesuk said that the Korean people fully support the struggle of the Vietnamese people. No matter how frantically American imperialism engages in stupid plots, it will inevitably suffer a miserable defeat in the war fire it has ignited.

After the reception, the film "Underground War" was screened.
