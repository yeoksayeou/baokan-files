The representatives of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers all stood up to warmly congratulate the 45th anniversary of the founding of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China. They shouted, “Long live Mao Zedong! Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of living Marxism-Leninism!”

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on July 1st, the representatives attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, while continuing their full-session meeting for discussions today, warmly congratulated the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China on its 45th anniversary. The representatives shouted, “Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Mao Zedong! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!” Some Asian and African representatives who spoke at the meeting enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought as “the beacon of the world’s people” and “a spiritual atomic bomb.”

At today’s full-session meeting, the leader of the Yemeni delegation, Salah Dahhan, suggested that the conference warmly congratulate the birthday of the Communist Party of China. He said, “Today is an eternal, great, and glorious day. Today is the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. We revolutionary Asian and African writers, on this very day, in this glorious country—the People’s Republic of China, the homeland of the great Communist Party of China, and the birthplace of Mao Zedong Thought, feel extremely fortunate.” Salah Dahhan, on behalf of the Yemeni delegation, proposed that Asian and African revolutionary writers express their congratulations on this great festival. At this moment, the entire audience stood up and gave a prolonged, stormy applause to express their warmest congratulations to the Communist Party of China. Salah Dahhan shouted from the podium, “Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Mao Zedong! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!”

Today, some representatives expressed their sincere love for Chairman Mao in their speeches and elaborated on the great significance of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Malaysian representative, Sharma, said in his speech: Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon of the world’s working class and people. It has given them the theory of people’s war and taught them the great truth that “political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” He said: Mao Zedong Thought has great material power because it embodies the living revolutionary principles of the contemporary world. It is the peak of living Marxism-Leninism.

He said: The oppressed nations and peoples of the world all hail Mao Zedong Thought as their spiritual atomic bomb. With Mao Zedong Thought, the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples can smash imperialism led by the United States and the old and new colonialism, as well as modern revisionism led by the Soviet leadership.

Sharma said that the Malaysian people, inspired by Mao Zedong Thought, are strengthening their struggle against the enemy—the British and American imperialists and their puppets in the country—in all aspects, especially in armed struggle.

Sharma highly praised the cultural revolution of the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. He said that this revolution on the cultural front not only promotes the socialist cause of the Chinese people but also has an immeasurable influence on the present and future of the world. Imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionism are trembling with fear, but the working class and people of the world are cheering.

The Malian representative, Mamadou Gologo, said that respected Chairman Mao is the beacon of contemporary revolution, illuminating the broad revolutionary path for the world’s people. Gologo expressed his respect and admiration for the great leader of the Chinese people.

The Philippine representative, Amado Hernandez, praised Chairman Mao as “the great teacher and leader of the world’s people, the inspirational force and beacon of all emerging countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.” In his speech, he shouted, “Long live our beloved Chairman Mao, the invincible leader who leads the People’s Republic of China to prosperity and happiness!”

The Botswanan representative, Enzi Mohale, said that Mao Zedong Thought is the unquenchable torch and red sun for all revolutionaries in the world. Chairman Mao is one of the greatest thinkers and writers of our time. He quoted Chairman Mao’s “Talks at the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art,” hoping that Asian and African writers would take up their pens and fight alongside the Asian and African peoples to defeat imperialism.

The Ceylonese representative, Jayaratne, said in his speech: Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people are high-spiritedly carrying out the cultural revolution with the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. At this moment, our gathering of Asian and African writers in Beijing is of great significance. Because the cultural revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is not only a part of the world socialist movement but also a part of the anti-imperialist and national liberation movement.

The representatives from Mali, Nepal, the Philippines, Morocco, Malaysia, Iran, Botswana, Ceylon, and other countries spoke at today’s meeting. (Summaries of speeches by representatives of various countries will be published on the sixth page today.)

A congratulatory telegram from the Albanian Writers’ Union to this conference was read at today’s meeting.

The executive chairpersons for today’s morning meeting were representatives from India, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Yemen, Algeria, Ivory Coast, and Somalia. Representatives from Cambodia, Ceylon, Pakistan, Rwanda, the Somali Coast, and Southwest Africa (regions) served as the executive chairpersons for today’s afternoon meeting.

    马来亚代表沙尔玛在发言中说：毛泽东思想是世界工人阶级和人民的灯塔，它给了他们以人民战争的理论，教给了他们“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大真理。他说：毛泽东思想有着伟大的物质力量，因为它体现了当代世界的活的革命原则，它是活的马克思列宁主义的顶峰。
    他说：全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民都欢呼毛泽东思想是他们的精神原子弹。亚非拉人民有了毛泽东思想，就可以粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，以及以苏联领导集团为首的现代修正主义。
    沙尔玛说，马来亚人民在毛泽东思想鼓舞下，正在各方面，特别是在武装斗争方面，加强反对敌人——英美帝国主义者及其在当地的傀儡的斗争。
    沙尔玛高度评价在毛泽东思想指导下的中国人民的文化大革命。他说，这个文化战线上的革命，不仅推进着中国人民的社会主义事业，而且对世界的现在与未来发挥着不可估量的影响。帝国主义、反动派和现代修正主义正在吓得发抖，但是，工人阶级和全世界人民都为之欢呼。
