    Zimbabwe representative Elias Rusike said at the emergency meeting of the Asian-African Writers' Conference today that the people of Zimbabwe are waging a war against the evil forces of colonialism and imperialism.

    In his speech, he strongly condemned the brutal rule and oppression of imperialism and colonialists against the people of Zimbabwe. He said, the Africans in Zimbabwe are directly and concretely engaged in military confrontation with the white settler colonialism and British colonialism within our country. This war is just, and we are definitely going to win it. Our military actions within the country have received tremendous support from the broad masses of the people.

    He said, the current struggle of the Zimbabwean people is for the complete liberation of Zimbabwe and the Zimbabwean people. Zimbabwe is ours, and it will forever be ours. For the cause of liberation, we are willing to sacrifice everything.

    He spoke about the bloody repression suffered by the African people since the Smith regime unilaterally declared independence in Zimbabwe, and the heroic struggle waged by the Zimbabwe African National Union. He said, the current armed struggle of the Zimbabwe African National Union has inspired the people of Zimbabwe, prompting them to take even more intense resistance actions. All this is only the beginning of our liberation war, and this war will definitely be victorious.

    Elias Rusike also strongly condemned the bloody massacres and aggression of American imperialism against the Vietnamese people at the meeting, and paid tribute to the Vietnamese people who are fighting. He said, the people of Zimbabwe support the liberation war of the Vietnamese people. The spirit of dedication and determination of the Vietnamese people is a great inspiration to the four million Zimbabwean people who are waging the same liberation war.

    Rusike condemned the divisive activities of modern revisionists in his speech. He said, the writers of Zimbabwe have confidence in the permanent bureau of Asian-African writers. He reminded all Asian-African writers to be vigilant and not to fall into the cunning traps of the enemy.

    他说，目前津巴布韦人民的斗争，是为了津巴布韦和津巴布韦人民的彻底解放。津巴布韦是我们的，世世代代永远是我们的。为了解放事业我们不惜牺牲一切。
