The emergency conference of Asian and African writers concluded successfully this morning. All speakers expressed their firm resolve to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. They also expressed the revolutionary spirit of the Asian and African peoples in their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle, and their confidence in a decisive victory over the enemy. The representatives from various countries unanimously praised Chairman Mao as the greatest hope for the oppressed peoples.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 5th, the emergency conference of Asian and African writers concluded its discussions this morning. The presiding chairman of the plenary session, Suleiman Amadou from Niger, declared at the conclusion of the discussions, "We can announce to the world that our conference has been a success. This success is reflected in our unanimous views: Over the past few days, all speakers have expressed their unwavering resolve to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation; they have expressed the spirit of solidarity in the struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa; they have expressed the revolutionary spirit of the Asian and African peoples in their anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle, and their confidence in a decisive victory over the enemy; they have expressed their trust and love for the Chinese people."

He said, "This victory is a common one for the peoples of Asia and Africa because we are fighting a common enemy and have common goals in our struggle."

The plenary session of the emergency conference of Asian and African writers, which began on June 28th and concluded this morning, featured reports from representatives of ten countries (regions). Representatives and observers from forty-six countries (regions) and five international organizations also spoke at the conference.

Suleiman Amadou, the presiding chairman of today's morning session, spoke about the discussions over the past few days, saying, "The speeches from various countries have expressed their unlimited trust in the Chinese people. The Chinese people, especially Chairman Mao Zedong, have supported the just struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa with unyielding efforts and all their strength."

He said, "The representatives from various countries believe that if the next conference of Asian and African writers is held in Beijing, it will certainly provide all kinds of conditions for genuine anti-imperialist, anti-colonial, and anti-racist Asian and African writers. We all hope that we can meet again in this revolutionary holy land. He also hoped that all revolutionary writers, after this conference, would strengthen their struggles against the aggression and all evil activities of imperialism."

At today's morning session, speakers continued to strongly condemn the heinous crimes of American imperialism in bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, protesting against the new "escalation" of American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, and enthusiastically celebrating the great victories recently achieved by the heroic Vietnamese people. They pointed out that American imperialism is trying to use savage bombing to impose a "peace talk" fraud on the Vietnamese people, which is absolutely impossible. The Vietnamese people will certainly deal a more severe blow to the enemy until they achieve final victory.

Whenever a speaker mentioned the beloved Chairman Mao Zedong, the entire hall erupted in thunderous applause. Some speakers, amidst the resounding and enthusiastic applause, shouted, "Let us advance together under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought—the invincible weapon! The representatives from various countries sincerely praised Chairman Mao Zedong, pointing out, "Imperialism and reactionaries all hate Mao Zedong, while the oppressed peoples of the world all love Mao Zedong," "The name of Mao Zedong and the works of Mao Zedong will live forever," "Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest hope for the oppressed peoples."

Speakers at today's morning session included representatives from Algeria and Lebanon, an observer from Mozambique, and representatives from India and Pakistan. (Summaries of the speeches are on page six.)

The Algerian representative, at the end of his speech, presented a flag of Algeria to the delegation of writers from the fighting South of Vietnam. Today marks the fourth anniversary of Algeria's independence. At the suggestion of the conference chairman, the entire audience stood in silence to honor the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the Algerian national liberation struggle.

The representatives from Lebanon, India, and Pakistan, in their speeches, all expressed support for the proposal to hold the Third Conference of Asian and African Writers in Beijing.

The presiding chairmen of today's morning session were representatives from South Vietnam, Yemen, Cambodia, Morocco, Niger, and other countries (regions).

This afternoon, the conference began group discussions.
