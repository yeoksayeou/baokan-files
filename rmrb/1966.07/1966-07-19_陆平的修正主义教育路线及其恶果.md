In 1958, the Party Central Committee proposed the educational policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor." Under the guidance of the Party's educational policy, our country launched an educational revolution. The bourgeois educational system and ideology were attacked, and the old teaching order was broken. This inevitably caused panic and hatred among all representatives of the bourgeoisie within and outside the Party.

At that time, Lu Ping, who had usurped the leadership of Peking University, was under the pressure of the educational revolution. He had to pretend to support the revolutionary actions of the broad masses of teachers and students participating in half-work, half-study, and academic criticism. However, by 1959, they began to sabotage the educational revolution and gradually restore the old teaching order. In 1960, when our country faced temporary economic difficulties, Lu Ping saw the opportunity and launched a full-scale counterattack against the educational revolution since 1958.

In early 1962, after a series of preparations, Lu Ping proposed the revisionist educational policy of "learning from the Soviet Union and referring to Britain and America." He also proposed to "take Moscow University as the learning target" and turn Peking University into a revisionist university. Under the control of the Khrushchev revisionist clique, the Soviet Union's education had actually become capitalist. Lu Ping emphasized the need to "learn from the Soviet Union" to bring the revisionist educational system to our country and oppose the Party's educational policy. Lu Ping's revisionist proposals were fully supported by the bourgeois intellectuals. They actively worked for Lu Ping, using the black goods from the old universities of the imperialist United States and the Kuomintang regime to enrich Lu Ping's revisionist content.

Lu Ping's educational policy of "learning from the Soviet Union and referring to Britain and America" was essentially a hodgepodge of revisionism, imperialism, and feudalism, and a replica of the educational policy of semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China.

From Lu Ping's revised teaching plans, we can clearly see the counter-revolutionary nature of his educational policy.

First, in terms of teaching content, the following prominent situations appeared in the liberal arts:

1. Completely excluding Mao Zedong Thought. Many majors did not open or canceled courses on Mao Zedong's works; some majors that still retained some courses on Mao Zedong's works only used them as a decoration, and the teaching content and methods were diametrically opposed to Mao Zedong Thought. For example, in the political economy major, the course on selected works of Mao Zedong was only 75 hours over five years; while contemporary bourgeois economic theories were included in the major foundation courses for 72 hours. In the 18 specialized and elective courses, there was not a single course on Mao Zedong's economic thought, while bourgeois academic thought, economic history, and courses on capitalist countries' economies amounted to 14 courses. In the Chinese literature and Chinese history majors, there were no courses on Mao Zedong's literary and historical thought over five years. The Political Department taught modern Chinese revolutionary history without using Chairman Mao's works as the guideline. Some teachers even openly opposed teaching political science with Mao Zedong Thought.

2. Serious emphasis on the past and neglect of the present, detachment from reality, and pedantic philosophy. Lu Ping resolutely resisted Chairman Mao's instructions on teaching content to be "emphasize the present and de-emphasize the past" and "less but better." The revised teaching plans for the departments of literature, history, philosophy, and economics were dominated by ancient and foreign courses. For example, in the political economy major, 14 out of the 18 specialized and elective courses were of this type; the philosophy major offered more than 40 specialized and elective courses, with 30 of them being of this type. Under the guidance of the idea of "business first," Lu Ping actively promoted "more andÊùÇ" teaching content and engaged in pedantic philosophy. Some majors or specialized courses were divided into finer parts, and some courses that were originally one were split into several. The number of class hours increased significantly, adding to the students' burden and seriously hindering the all-around development of students' morality, intelligence, and physical fitness.

3. Completely handing over the leadership of teaching and scientific research to bourgeois professors. Almost all bourgeois scholars, as long as they were considered to have "one skill," regardless of their quality, were promoted to the lectern. Bourgeois reactionary philosophy, literature, history, economics, law, sociology, and psychology were all released. These materials, according to Lu Ping's requirements, were to be "introduced comprehensively and truthfully" to the students. Lu Ping personally mobilized bourgeois professors to take the lectern, saying, "Speak out and it's good, speak out and it's serving socialism." Under Lu Ping's incitement, many bourgeois "authorities" spread the bourgeois reactionary and decadent goods they had long peddled before liberation to the students unchanged. The Lu Ping clique also tried to bring in reactionary legal and sociological "authorities" from outside the school; they even ran around inviting rightists, former Trotskyites, and traitors from outside the school to give lectures at Peking University. This turned the new Peking University of New China back into the old Peking University of the Kuomintang period, seriously poisoning the students' political thoughts.

During this period, the "teaching reform" in the sciences, in terms of course settings and class hour arrangements, completely followed the model of Moscow University. In the process of revising the teaching plans, Lu Ping instructed to use the 1960 teaching plans of Moscow University's mathematics, mechanics, physics, and chemistry majors as the basis for revision. Therefore, the revised teaching plans for the major science departments were basically copies of Moscow University.

Second, in terms of productive labor, Lu Ping completely denied the experience of half-work, half-study in 1958, saying, "Part-time work and study restricts the systematic theoretical training of lower-grade students," and that half-work, half-study hindered "teaching as the main focus." He not only denied half-work, half-study but also reduced the students' labor time to the minimum, i.e., not more than one month per year on average, and not more than 26 weeks over six years for science majors. Moreover, he did not emphasize going to factories and villages, not emphasize combining with workers and peasants, and not emphasize ideological reform. When students requested to go to factories and villages and combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Lu Ping clique did not support them but obstructed them. Lu Ping emphasized, "Participation in production struggles and class struggles by students must be based on professional characteristics." He used the excuse of "professional characteristics" to actually oppose students going to workers and peasants to participate in class struggles and production struggles. Under Lu Ping's guidance, the school used students as small workers, making them dig ditches, build fireplaces, and repair the Yuyuan canteen for bourgeois professors during labor. Teachers' labor time was compressed to half a month per year, with most of the time spent cleaning the campus. As for Lu Ping and other leading cadres, they did not participate in physical labor at all and had no contact with workers and peasants.

From this, we can see that Lu Ping's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational policy has two prominent features: First, it extremely hates Mao Zedong Thought. It completely implements the Khrushchev revisionist educational line, preserves the capitalist and feudal educational system, and completely excludes Mao Zedong Thought from leading, making education deviate from serving proletarian politics and become a tool of bourgeois dictatorship. Second, it extremely hates the combination of education and productive labor, excluding students from participating in the three great revolutionary movements. It opposes students combining with workers and peasants, cultivating students to become successors of the bourgeoisie, and leading them onto the counter-revolutionary road.

The revisionist educational policy of the Lu Ping clique stubbornly opposed the Party's implementation of the class line in higher education and ruthlessly excluded, attacked, and persecuted worker and peasant students. They distorted the policy of "emphasizing performance," regardless of class origin and political conditions, and opened the school gates wide for the children of the reactionary classes, while excluding a large number of excellent worker and peasant students outside the gates.

In terms of enrollment and examinations, the Lu Ping clique implemented the policy of "grades first." They believed that being good at business was being good at politics, and their so-called "emphasizing performance" was completely based on bourgeois political standards. Therefore, the students they enrolled, appreciated, and valued were often those with bad class origins, backward or reactionary political thoughts. They always looked down on and were extremely disgusted and hostile towards worker and peasant students.

In 1958, under the pressure of the educational revolution at that time, Peking University had enrolled a relatively large number of worker and peasant youths. This batch of worker and peasant students, after entering the school, suffered from the jealousy and hatred of the Lu Ping clique. They adopted various means of harassment and restrictions on this batch of worker and peasant students, making them face great difficulties in their studies. Finally, Lu Ping even proposed the method of "purging" to force them to shorten their study period, repeat a grade, or drop out, "purging" them out. Lu Ping slandered worker and peasant students as "leaky teacups" and "coarse porcelain teacups," saying that "coarse porcelain teacups cannot be carved with flowers," believing that worker and peasant students were not worth cultivating. In the eyes of the Lu Ping clique, worker and peasant students had no right to enter Peking University, and Peking University should not open its doors to the children of workers and peasants. They thought that Peking University opening its doors to the children of workers and peasants was a "strange phenomenon."

They, out of their reactionary bourgeois nature, always regarded worker and peasant students as "born idiots." They ignored all the factors that caused difficulties for worker and peasant students in their studies. When worker and peasant students requested the necessary care according to state regulations, they scolded them as "privilege seekers" and worker and peasant students as the "privileged class." The Lu Ping clique completely treated worker and peasant students with the attitude of the exploiting class towards the laboring people. They protected and supported bourgeois intellectuals in humiliating and harassing worker and peasant students, using the methods of promotion, demotion, and expulsion as means to persecute worker and peasant students. Many worker and peasant students often suffered ridicule and mockery from teachers in the classroom, making some worker and peasant students dare not go to teachers for tutoring. The Lu Ping clique completely followed the opinions of bourgeois intellectuals, mechanically and rigidly using the methods of promotion, demotion, and expulsion to persecute worker and peasant students. Lu Ping said, "What class line, if you can't study, you drop out!" As long as they thought that worker and peasant students violated their regulations, they would take decisive and merciless measures without asking any questions, leaving no room for negotiation. Under the rule of the Lu Ping clique, the right of worker and peasant students to receive education was not guaranteed. A worker and peasant student who complained about the persecution he suffered at Peking University said, "I have suffered two persecutions from landlords, one when I was a child herding cattle for a landlord in my hometown, and one during my study period at Peking University from the 'landlord' of Peking University." Under the control of the Lu Ping clique, Peking University indeed became an organ of dictatorship by capitalists and landlords over the children of workers and peasants, and the Lu Ping clique was a group of capitalist and landlord lords.

The revisionist educational line of the Lu Ping clique inevitably excluded worker and peasant students. They wanted to achieve the "peaceful evolution" of capitalism in our country and cultivate revisionist successors, so they had to limit the school's opening to workers and peasants. The Lu Ping clique declared, "In the future, the dominant force in the intellectual world will not be the children of workers and peasants, but the children of high-level intellectuals and clerical families." The high-level intellectuals and clerical families mentioned here, of course, include the bourgeoisie, which does not need to be said. According to their view, the intellectual world of our country in the future will not be proletarian but bourgeois. What else is this if not their dream of "peaceful evolution"?

Chairman Mao said, "Our educational policy should enable the educated to develop in moral, intellectual, and physical education and become socially conscious, cultured laborers."

The revisionist educational policy of the Lu Ping clique is completely opposed to Chairman Mao's instructions. Lu Ping proposed, "Comprehensive universities cultivate teaching staff, scientific research personnel, and practical working cadres in all major scientific fields and in industry, agriculture, culture, and education." The cultivation target of Lu Ping is essentially to cultivate bourgeois experts, not socially conscious, cultured laborers. Under the guidance of Lu Ping's cultivation target, many young people, with the idea of becoming experts and leading cadres and seeking fame and fortune, entered Peking University.

From the day students entered the school, the Lu Ping clique worked hard from all aspects to cultivate them into successors of the bourgeoisie.

First, the Lu Ping clique obstructed and sabotaged the mass movement of voluntarily studying Chairman Mao's works. After 1958 and after 1964, the masses voluntarily launched two high tides of studying Chairman Mao's works, both of which were sabotaged by the Lu Ping clique. The Lu Ping clique's intentions were extremely vicious. They harbored deep hatred for Mao Zedong Thought because they were very clear that once Mao Zedong Thought was mastered by the broad masses, their revisionism would be difficult to conceal, and their plot to restore capitalism would be doomed to failure.

Second, the Lu Ping clique implemented bourgeois "genius education." During the enrollment and examinations, they paid attention to selecting "elite students," regardless of their political situation, as long as they were "elite students," they would be appreciated and valued. Those they considered to have "cultivation prospects" were given various special treatments, and experienced teachers were assigned to cultivate them carefully. Even some rightist students, who were considered to have linguistic genius, were specially assigned two teachers to tutor them in learning a third foreign language. They were completely business-oriented. A bourgeois scholar described this educational method as follows: "For example, swimming across a river, those who swim across will reach the other side, and those who cannot swim will drown." Many young people were led by them to walk the road of bourgeois individual struggle and pursue personal fame and fortune.

Third, through the classroom, they systematically instilled bourgeois and revisionist thoughts into students, advocating the decadent and corrupt worldviews of the bourgeoisie and feudal class, poisoning young students, and gradually changing their thoughts. Some students recalled the process of their poisoning, saying that they had a "three-part series" towards bourgeois things: disgust, adaptation, and pursuit. In a certain foreign language department, a few students who had just entered the school wanted to progress and were dissatisfied with the school's evil winds. After a few years, these few people had regressed compared to before. They learned a lot of Western bourgeois things and mastered the set of eating, drinking, playing, and enjoying. Before each graduation, complex thought situations appeared among the students, seeking comfort, lingering in big cities, fearing to go to remote areas, and fearing to participate in physical labor became relatively common phenomena.

Fourth, the Lu Ping clique also tried to lure young teachers to walk the road of bourgeois fame and fortune. In 1962, Lu Ping formulated a "teacher training method," stipulating a strict hierarchy and promotion conditions between assistant lecturers, lecturers, associate professors, and professors. This was purely a bourgeois method of "business first." The Lu Ping clique explained, "As long as one is not politically anti-Party and anti-socialism," but meets the "method's" requirements in business, one can be promoted in academic rank. They canceled the political standards for teachers and required teachers to struggle for academic ranks and personal fame and fortune.

Lu Ping also selected 87 teachers from the entire school as key training targets, letting them basically detach from teaching work, study in seclusion, and write articles. Many of them were only experts, not red, and some had systematic revisionist thoughts.

Fifth, the Lu Ping clique completely handed over the cultivation of young teachers and graduate students to bourgeois professors. Starting from 1959, Lu Ping let young teachers "match" with old professors, using old professors as targets to catch up with. Many people were subtly influenced by bourgeois experts and fell into the water. Some young people followed bourgeois experts to write books and translations, and after making foreign money, their requirements for political progress gradually faded. They gradually became the second generation of bourgeois experts.

The selection and cultivation of graduate students were also handed over to bourgeois professors, abandoning management and political ideological work, making many graduate students accept the educational thoughts, academic thoughts, and lifestyles of bourgeois scholars. Many of them only focused on business, ignored politics, and became spiritual nobles.

In Peking University, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat for the younger generation was extremely sharp and complex, and it was a life-and-death struggle.

Our Party's educational policy is a thorough revolutionary policy, serving to thoroughly eliminate the three great differences and thoroughly eliminate all remnants of the exploiting classes and exploiting systems. Therefore, as soon as the Party's educational policy was proposed, it was fiercely opposed by all anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois representatives and all ghosts and monsters. All the counter-revolutionary measures taken by the Lu Ping clique in Peking University were aimed at our Party's educational policy. They tried to preserve, deepen, and expand the three great differences, accumulate strength, and wait for the opportunity to fully restore the capitalist exploitation system in our country. We must learn from the struggle against the Lu Ping counter-revolutionary clique. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely implement the Party's educational policy, thoroughly reform the old educational system, thoroughly reform the old Peking University, thoroughly settle accounts with the reactionary bourgeois educational line of the Lu Ping clique, and thoroughly uproot the revisionist roots of Peking University.
