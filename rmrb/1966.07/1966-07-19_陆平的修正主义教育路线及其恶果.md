In 1958, the Party Central Committee proposed the educational policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor." Under the guidance of the Party's educational policy, our country launched an educational revolution. The bourgeois educational system and ideology were attacked, and the old teaching order was broken. This inevitably caused panic and hatred among all representatives of the bourgeoisie within and outside the Party.

At that time, Lu Ping, who had usurped the leadership of Peking University, was under the pressure of the educational revolution. He had to pretend to support the revolutionary actions of the broad masses of teachers and students participating in half-work, half-study, and academic criticism. However, by 1959, they began to sabotage the educational revolution and gradually restore the old teaching order. In 1960, when our country faced temporary economic difficulties, Lu Ping saw the opportunity and launched a full-scale counterattack against the educational revolution since 1958.

In early 1962, after a series of preparations, Lu Ping proposed the revisionist educational policy of "learning from the Soviet Union and referring to Britain and America." He also proposed to "take Moscow University as the learning target" and turn Peking University into a revisionist university. Under the control of the Khrushchev revisionist clique, the Soviet Union's education had actually become capitalist. Lu Ping emphasized the need to "learn from the Soviet Union" to bring the revisionist educational system to our country and oppose the Party's educational policy. Lu Ping's revisionist proposals were fully supported by the bourgeois intellectuals. They actively worked for Lu Ping, using the black goods from the old universities of the imperialist United States and the Kuomintang regime to enrich Lu Ping's revisionist content.

Lu Ping's educational policy of "learning from the Soviet Union and referring to Britain and America" was essentially a hodgepodge of revisionism, imperialism, and feudalism, and a replica of the educational policy of semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China.

From Lu Ping's revised teaching plans, we can clearly see the counter-revolutionary nature of his educational policy.

First, in terms of teaching content, the following prominent situations appeared in the liberal arts:

1. Completely excluding Mao Zedong Thought. Many majors did not open or canceled courses on Mao Zedong's works; some majors that still retained some courses on Mao Zedong's works only used them as a decoration, and the teaching content and methods were diametrically opposed to Mao Zedong Thought. For example, in the political economy major, the course on selected works of Mao Zedong was only 75 hours over five years; while contemporary bourgeois economic theories were included in the major foundation courses for 72 hours. In the 18 specialized and elective courses, there was not a single course on Mao Zedong's economic thought, while bourgeois academic thought, economic history, and courses on capitalist countries' economies amounted to 14 courses. In the Chinese literature and Chinese history majors, there were no courses on Mao Zedong's literary and historical thought over five years. The Political Department taught modern Chinese revolutionary history without using Chairman Mao's works as the guideline. Some teachers even openly opposed teaching political science with Mao Zedong Thought.

2. Serious emphasis on the past and neglect of the present, detachment from reality, and pedantic philosophy. Lu Ping resolutely resisted Chairman Mao's instructions on teaching content to be "emphasize the present and de-emphasize the past" and "less but better." The revised teaching plans for the departments of literature, history, philosophy, and economics were dominated by ancient and foreign courses. For example, in the political economy major, 14 out of the 18 specialized and elective courses were of this type; the philosophy major offered more than 40 specialized and elective courses, with 30 of them being of this type. Under the guidance of the idea of "business first," Lu Ping actively promoted "more and杂" teaching content and engaged in pedantic philosophy. Some majors or specialized courses were divided into finer parts, and some courses that were originally one were split into several. The number of class hours increased significantly, adding to the students' burden and seriously hindering the all-around development of students' morality, intelligence, and physical fitness.

3. Completely handing over the leadership of teaching and scientific research to bourgeois professors. Almost all bourgeois scholars, as long as they were considered to have "one skill," regardless of their quality, were promoted to the lectern. Bourgeois reactionary philosophy, literature, history, economics, law, sociology, and psychology were all released. These materials, according to Lu Ping's requirements, were to be "introduced comprehensively and truthfully" to the students. Lu Ping personally mobilized bourgeois professors to take the lectern, saying, "Speak out and it's good, speak out and it's serving socialism." Under Lu Ping's incitement, many bourgeois "authorities" spread the bourgeois reactionary and decadent goods they had long peddled before liberation to the students unchanged. The Lu Ping clique also tried to bring in reactionary legal and sociological "authorities" from outside the school; they even ran around inviting rightists, former Trotskyites, and traitors from outside the school to give lectures at Peking University. This turned the new Peking University of New China back into the old Peking University of the Kuomintang period, seriously poisoning the students' political thoughts.

During this period, the "teaching reform" in the sciences, in terms of course settings and class hour arrangements, completely followed the model of Moscow University. In the process of revising the teaching plans, Lu Ping instructed to use the 1960 teaching plans of Moscow University's mathematics, mechanics, physics, and chemistry majors as the basis for revision. Therefore, the revised teaching plans for the major science departments were basically copies of Moscow University.

Second, in terms of productive labor, Lu Ping completely denied the experience of half-work, half-study in 1958, saying, "Part-time work and study restricts the systematic theoretical training of lower-grade students," and that half-work, half-study hindered "teaching as the main focus." He not only denied half-work, half-study but also reduced the students' labor time to the minimum, i.e., not more than one month per year on average, and not more than 26 weeks over six years for science majors. Moreover, he did not emphasize going to factories and villages, not emphasize combining with workers and peasants, and not emphasize ideological reform. When students requested to go to factories and villages and combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Lu Ping clique did not support them but obstructed them. Lu Ping emphasized, "Participation in production struggles and class struggles by students must be based on professional characteristics." He used the excuse of "professional characteristics" to actually oppose students going to workers and peasants to participate in class struggles and production struggles. Under Lu Ping's guidance, the school used students as small workers, making them dig ditches, build fireplaces, and repair the Yuyuan canteen for bourgeois professors during labor. Teachers' labor time was compressed to half a month per year, with most of the time spent cleaning the campus. As for Lu Ping and other leading cadres, they did not participate in physical labor at all and had no contact with workers and peasants.

From this, we can see that Lu Ping's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational policy has two prominent features: First, it extremely hates Mao Zedong Thought. It completely implements the Khrushchev revisionist educational line, preserves the capitalist and feudal educational system, and completely excludes Mao Zedong Thought from leading, making education deviate from serving proletarian politics and become a tool of bourgeois dictatorship. Second, it extremely hates the combination of education and productive labor, excluding students from participating in the three great revolutionary movements. It opposes students combining with workers and peasants, cultivating students to become successors of the bourgeoisie, and leading them onto the counter-revolutionary road.

The revisionist educational policy of the Lu Ping clique stubbornly opposed the Party's implementation of the class line in higher education and ruthlessly excluded, attacked, and persecuted worker and peasant students. They distorted the policy of "emphasizing performance," regardless of class origin and political conditions, and opened the school gates wide for the children of the reactionary classes, while excluding a large number of excellent worker and peasant students outside the gates.

In terms of enrollment and examinations, the Lu Ping clique implemented the policy of "grades first." They believed that being good at business was being good at politics, and their so-called "emphasizing performance" was completely based on bourgeois political standards. Therefore, the students they enrolled, appreciated, and valued were often those with bad class origins, backward or reactionary political thoughts. They always looked down on and were extremely disgusted and hostile towards worker and peasant students.

In 1958, under the pressure of the educational revolution at that time, Peking University had enrolled a relatively large number of worker and peasant youths. This batch of worker and peasant students, after entering the school, suffered from the jealousy and hatred of the Lu Ping clique. They adopted various means of harassment and restrictions on this batch of worker and peasant students, making them face great difficulties in their studies. Finally, Lu Ping even proposed the method of "purging" to force them to shorten their study period, repeat a grade, or drop out, "purging" them out. Lu Ping slandered worker and peasant students as "leaky teacups" and "coarse porcelain teacups," saying that "coarse porcelain teacups cannot be carved with flowers," believing that worker and peasant students were not worth cultivating. In the eyes of the Lu Ping clique, worker and peasant students had no right to enter Peking University, and Peking University should not open its doors to the children of workers and peasants. They thought that Peking University opening its doors to the children of workers and peasants was a "strange phenomenon."

They, out of their reactionary bourgeois nature, always regarded worker and peasant students as "born idiots." They ignored all the factors that caused difficulties for worker and peasant students in their studies. When worker and peasant students requested the necessary care according to state regulations, they scolded them as "privilege seekers" and worker and peasant students as the "privileged class." The Lu Ping clique completely treated worker and peasant students with the attitude of the exploiting class towards the laboring people. They protected and supported bourgeois intellectuals in humiliating and harassing worker and peasant students, using the methods of promotion, demotion, and expulsion as means to persecute worker and peasant students. Many worker and peasant students often suffered ridicule and mockery from teachers in the classroom, making some worker and peasant students dare not go to teachers for tutoring. The Lu Ping clique completely followed the opinions of bourgeois intellectuals, mechanically and rigidly using the methods of promotion, demotion, and expulsion to persecute worker and peasant students. Lu Ping said, "What class line, if you can't study, you drop out!" As long as they thought that worker and peasant students violated their regulations, they would take decisive and merciless measures without asking any questions, leaving no room for negotiation. Under the rule of the Lu Ping clique, the right of worker and peasant students to receive education was not guaranteed. A worker and peasant student who complained about the persecution he suffered at Peking University said, "I have suffered two persecutions from landlords, one when I was a child herding cattle for a landlord in my hometown, and one during my study period at Peking University from the 'landlord' of Peking University." Under the control of the Lu Ping clique, Peking University indeed became an organ of dictatorship by capitalists and landlords over the children of workers and peasants, and the Lu Ping clique was a group of capitalist and landlord lords.

The revisionist educational line of the Lu Ping clique inevitably excluded worker and peasant students. They wanted to achieve the "peaceful evolution" of capitalism in our country and cultivate revisionist successors, so they had to limit the school's opening to workers and peasants. The Lu Ping clique declared, "In the future, the dominant force in the intellectual world will not be the children of workers and peasants, but the children of high-level intellectuals and clerical families." The high-level intellectuals and clerical families mentioned here, of course, include the bourgeoisie, which does not need to be said. According to their view, the intellectual world of our country in the future will not be proletarian but bourgeois. What else is this if not their dream of "peaceful evolution"?

Chairman Mao said, "Our educational policy should enable the educated to develop in moral, intellectual, and physical education and become socially conscious, cultured laborers."

The revisionist educational policy of the Lu Ping clique is completely opposed to Chairman Mao's instructions. Lu Ping proposed, "Comprehensive universities cultivate teaching staff, scientific research personnel, and practical working cadres in all major scientific fields and in industry, agriculture, culture, and education." The cultivation target of Lu Ping is essentially to cultivate bourgeois experts, not socially conscious, cultured laborers. Under the guidance of Lu Ping's cultivation target, many young people, with the idea of becoming experts and leading cadres and seeking fame and fortune, entered Peking University.

From the day students entered the school, the Lu Ping clique worked hard from all aspects to cultivate them into successors of the bourgeoisie.

First, the Lu Ping clique obstructed and sabotaged the mass movement of voluntarily studying Chairman Mao's works. After 1958 and after 1964, the masses voluntarily launched two high tides of studying Chairman Mao's works, both of which were sabotaged by the Lu Ping clique. The Lu Ping clique's intentions were extremely vicious. They harbored deep hatred for Mao Zedong Thought because they were very clear that once Mao Zedong Thought was mastered by the broad masses, their revisionism would be difficult to conceal, and their plot to restore capitalism would be doomed to failure.

Second, the Lu Ping clique implemented bourgeois "genius education." During the enrollment and examinations, they paid attention to selecting "elite students," regardless of their political situation, as long as they were "elite students," they would be appreciated and valued. Those they considered to have "cultivation prospects" were given various special treatments, and experienced teachers were assigned to cultivate them carefully. Even some rightist students, who were considered to have linguistic genius, were specially assigned two teachers to tutor them in learning a third foreign language. They were completely business-oriented. A bourgeois scholar described this educational method as follows: "For example, swimming across a river, those who swim across will reach the other side, and those who cannot swim will drown." Many young people were led by them to walk the road of bourgeois individual struggle and pursue personal fame and fortune.

Third, through the classroom, they systematically instilled bourgeois and revisionist thoughts into students, advocating the decadent and corrupt worldviews of the bourgeoisie and feudal class, poisoning young students, and gradually changing their thoughts. Some students recalled the process of their poisoning, saying that they had a "three-part series" towards bourgeois things: disgust, adaptation, and pursuit. In a certain foreign language department, a few students who had just entered the school wanted to progress and were dissatisfied with the school's evil winds. After a few years, these few people had regressed compared to before. They learned a lot of Western bourgeois things and mastered the set of eating, drinking, playing, and enjoying. Before each graduation, complex thought situations appeared among the students, seeking comfort, lingering in big cities, fearing to go to remote areas, and fearing to participate in physical labor became relatively common phenomena.

Fourth, the Lu Ping clique also tried to lure young teachers to walk the road of bourgeois fame and fortune. In 1962, Lu Ping formulated a "teacher training method," stipulating a strict hierarchy and promotion conditions between assistant lecturers, lecturers, associate professors, and professors. This was purely a bourgeois method of "business first." The Lu Ping clique explained, "As long as one is not politically anti-Party and anti-socialism," but meets the "method's" requirements in business, one can be promoted in academic rank. They canceled the political standards for teachers and required teachers to struggle for academic ranks and personal fame and fortune.

Lu Ping also selected 87 teachers from the entire school as key training targets, letting them basically detach from teaching work, study in seclusion, and write articles. Many of them were only experts, not red, and some had systematic revisionist thoughts.

Fifth, the Lu Ping clique completely handed over the cultivation of young teachers and graduate students to bourgeois professors. Starting from 1959, Lu Ping let young teachers "match" with old professors, using old professors as targets to catch up with. Many people were subtly influenced by bourgeois experts and fell into the water. Some young people followed bourgeois experts to write books and translations, and after making foreign money, their requirements for political progress gradually faded. They gradually became the second generation of bourgeois experts.

The selection and cultivation of graduate students were also handed over to bourgeois professors, abandoning management and political ideological work, making many graduate students accept the educational thoughts, academic thoughts, and lifestyles of bourgeois scholars. Many of them only focused on business, ignored politics, and became spiritual nobles.

In Peking University, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat for the younger generation was extremely sharp and complex, and it was a life-and-death struggle.

Our Party's educational policy is a thorough revolutionary policy, serving to thoroughly eliminate the three great differences and thoroughly eliminate all remnants of the exploiting classes and exploiting systems. Therefore, as soon as the Party's educational policy was proposed, it was fiercely opposed by all anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois representatives and all ghosts and monsters. All the counter-revolutionary measures taken by the Lu Ping clique in Peking University were aimed at our Party's educational policy. They tried to preserve, deepen, and expand the three great differences, accumulate strength, and wait for the opportunity to fully restore the capitalist exploitation system in our country. We must learn from the struggle against the Lu Ping counter-revolutionary clique. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely implement the Party's educational policy, thoroughly reform the old educational system, thoroughly reform the old Peking University, thoroughly settle accounts with the reactionary bourgeois educational line of the Lu Ping clique, and thoroughly uproot the revisionist roots of Peking University.

    陆平的修正主义教育路线及其恶果
　　孔繁
    一九五八年，党中央提出“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合”的教育方针。在党的教育方针指导下，我国兴起了一场教育大革命，资产阶级的教育制度和教育思想受到冲击，旧的教学秩序被打破了，这就不能不引起党内外一切资产阶级代表人物的恐慌和仇恨。
    当时窃据了北京大学领导的陆平反革命黑帮，在教育大革命的形势压迫之下，对于广大革命师生积极参加半工半读和学术批判的革命行动，不能不假装附和。但是到了一九五九年，他们就开始破坏教育革命，逐步恢复旧的教学秩序。一九六○年，在我国经济遇到暂时困难的情况下，陆平以为时机已到，便对一九五八年以来的教育大革命进行全面反扑。
　　一
    一九六二年初，陆平在经过一系列准备之后，提出了“学习苏联，参考英美”的修正主义教育方针。他还提出要“以莫斯科大学为学习目标”，把北京大学办成修正主义的大学。在赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团把持下，苏联的教育实际上已经资本主义化了。陆平强调要“学习苏联”，目的是要把修正主义的教育制度搬到我国来，对抗我党的教育方针。陆平的修正主义主张完全得到了资产阶级知识分子的拥护。他们积极为陆平卖力，用英美帝国主义和国民党统治时期旧大学的黑货，来充实陆平的修正主义内容。
    陆平的“学习苏联，参考英美”的教育方针，实质上是修正主义、帝国主义、封建主义的大杂烩，也是旧中国半殖民地半封建教育方针的翻版。
    我们从陆平修改后的教学规划，可以清楚地看到他的教育方针的反革命本质。
    第一，在教学内容方面，文科出现以下一些突出的情况：
    一、完全排斥毛泽东思想。许多专业不开或者取消了毛泽东著作课；有些专业虽然还保留一点毛泽东著作课，也不过是一种陪衬，而且教学内容与方法和毛泽东思想背道而驰。例如政治经济学专业，五年内，毛泽东著作选读课仅七十五学时；而当代资产阶级经济学说列入专业基础课的有七十二学时。在十八门专门课和选修课中根本没有毛泽东经济思想，而资产阶级学术思想、经济史和资本主义国家经济的课程达十四门之多。中国文学和中国史两个专业五年课程中，根本没有毛泽东文艺思想和史学思想的课程。政治系讲授中国现代革命史不以毛主席著作为纲。有的教师竟公开反对以毛泽东思想讲授政治学。
    二、严重的厚古薄今，脱离实际和烦琐哲学。陆平坚决抵制毛主席关于教学内容要厚今薄古和“少而精”的指示。文、史、哲、经等系修订后的教学计划，其中以古的、洋的课程占绝对多数。例如政治经济学专业十八门专门课和选修课，这类课程达十四门之多；哲学专业开设四十多门专门课和选修课，这类课程占了三十多门。在业务挂帅的思想指导下，陆平积极提倡教学内容“多而杂”，大搞烦琐哲学。有些专业或专门化课程越分越细，有些课本来是一门，却分几门。学时大为增加，加重了学生的负担，严重妨碍了学生德、智、体的全面发展。
    三、把教学和科学研究的领导权完全让给资产阶级教授。几乎所有的资产阶级学者，只要是被认为有“一技之长”，不管是什么货色，都被捧上讲台。资产阶级反动的哲学、文学、史学、经济学、法学、社会学、心理学，全部出笼。这些货色按照陆平的要求，都要向学生“作比较全面、如实的介绍”。陆平还亲自出马动员资产阶级教授登上讲台，他说：“讲出来就好，讲出来就是为社会主义服务”。在陆平的鼓动下，许多资产阶级“权威”，把他们解放前长期贩卖的资产阶级反动腐朽的货色，原封不动地向学生散播。陆平黑帮还竭力把校外的反动的法学、社会学“权威”拉入北大；甚至四出奔跑邀请校外的右派、过去当过托派、汉奸的人来北大讲学。这就把新中国的北大又变成了国民党时期的旧北大，使学生政治思想受到严重的毒害。
    这一时期，理科的“教学改革”，在课程设置、学时安排等问题上，完全以莫斯科大学为蓝本。在修订教学计划过程中，陆平指示将莫斯科大学数学、力学、物理、化学等专业一九六○年的教学计划，作为修订的依据。因此，理科各主要专业修订的教学计划基本上是莫斯科大学的翻版。
    第二，在生产劳动方面，陆平彻底否定了一九五八年半工半读的经验，他说：“边工边读对低年级学生系统基础理论上的训练是受到一定的限制”，认为半工半读妨碍“以教学为主”。他不仅否定了半工半读，而且把学生生产劳动的时间压缩到最低限度，即每年平均不超过一个月，理科各专业六年内劳动时间不超过二十六周。而且在劳动时间不强调下厂下乡，不强调和工农相结合，不强调思想改造。同学要求下厂下乡和工农兵相结合，陆平黑帮不支持，反而加以阻挠。陆平强调：“对于学生参加生产斗争、社会阶级斗争，必须从专业特点出发。”他借口“专业特点”，实际上是反对学生到工农兵中去参加阶级斗争和生产斗争。在陆平的这种思想指导下，学校把学生当作小工使用，让学生在劳动时给资产阶级教授挖阴沟、砌壁炉、修勺园餐厅等等。教师中每年劳动压缩到半个月，大部分时间用于清扫校园。至于陆平等领导干部则根本不参加体力劳动，根本不和工农兵接触。
    由此可以看出，陆平的反革命的修正主义教育方针有两个显著的特点：第一，极端地仇恨毛泽东思想。它完全推行赫鲁晓夫修正主义的教育路线，保存资本主义、封建主义的教育制度；完全排除毛泽东思想挂帅，使教育脱离为无产阶级政治服务的轨道，变成资产阶级专政的工具。第二，极端仇恨教育与生产劳动相结合，排斥学生参加三大革命运动。反对学生和工农兵相结合，培养学生成为资产阶级接班人，把他们引上反革命的道路。
　　二
    陆平黑帮的修正主义教育方针，顽固地反对党在高等学校中贯彻阶级路线，残酷地排斥、打击、迫害工农学生。他们歪曲“重在表现”的政策，不问阶级出身，不看政治条件，为反动阶级的子女大开校门，而将大批优秀的工农兵劳动人民的子女排斥在校门外。
    陆平黑帮在招生考试方面实行分数挂帅，他们认为业务好就是政治好，他们所谓的“重在表现”则完全是以资产阶级的政治标准作为尺度的。因此，为他们所招收、欣赏、重视的学生，有许多是出身不好、政治思想落后或者反动的。对于工农学生，他们总是看不顺眼，极端厌恶和仇视。
    一九五八年，在当时教育大革命的形势逼迫下，北京大学曾经招收较多的工农青年入学。这批工农同学入学后，遭到陆平黑帮的嫉恨仇视。他们对这批工农同学采取种种刁难和限制，使他们在学习中遇到很大困难。最后陆平竟然提出用“泻肚子”的办法，强迫他们缩短学习年限、留级或者退学，把他们“泻”了出去。陆平诬蔑工农同学是“漏水茶碗”，“粗瓷茶碗”，说“粗瓷茶碗不能硬雕花”，认为工农同学不堪培养。在陆平黑帮眼里，工农学生根本没有资格进北京大学，北京大学也不应当向工农子弟开门，他们认为要北大向工农子弟开门是“怪现象”。
    他们出于反动的资产阶级本性，总是把工农学生看成天生的“笨蛋”。对于造成工农学生在学习上困难的各种因素，他们一概不管。而对于工农学生提出按照国家的规定给以应有的照顾时，他们则骂为“特权要求”，骂工农学生为“特权阶层”。陆平黑帮完全以剥削阶级对待劳动人民的态度对待工农学生。他们包庇、支持资产阶级知识分子侮辱、刁难工农学生，把升、留级和退学办法当成惩罚工农学生的手段。许多工农学生经常在课堂受到教师的讥讽、嘲弄，使得一些工农同学不敢去找教师辅导。陆平黑帮完全按照资产阶级知识分子的意见办事，机械、生硬地搬用升、留级和退学办法，对工农学生进行阶级迫害。陆平说：“什么阶级路线，学不好，就退学！”只要他们认为工农学生违反了他们的规定，便不问任何情况，采取坚决无情的措施，丝毫没有商量的余地。在陆平黑帮统治的北京大学，工农子弟受教育的权利是没有保障的，有一个工农同学控诉他在北京大学遭受迫害的情况时说：“我受过两次地主的迫害，一次是我幼年在家乡给地主放牛时受到的地主的迫害，一次是在北大学习期间所受到的北大的‘地主’的迫害”。在陆平黑帮把持下的北京大学，确实成了资本家和地主对工农子女专政的机关，陆平黑帮就是一群资本家和地主老爷。
    陆平黑帮的修正主义教育路线，必然要排斥工农学生。他们要在我国实现资本主义的“和平演变”，培养修正主义的接班人，就必然要限制学校对工农开门。陆平黑帮断言：“将来知识界中占优势的不是工农子弟，而是高级知识分子和职员家庭的子弟。”这里所说的高级知识分子和职员当然是包括资产阶级在内，这是用不着多说的。按照他们的看法，将来我国的知识界将不是无产阶级的，而是资产阶级的。这不是他们的“和平演变”美梦又是什么？
　　三
    毛主席说：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”
    陆平黑帮的修正主义教育方针同毛主席的指示完全是针锋相对的。陆平提出：“综合大学培养一切主要科学方面的师资、科学研究人材和工业、农业、文教等各方面的实际工作干部”。陆平的这个培养目标实质上是培养资产阶级专家，而不是培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。在陆平的这个培养目标的引诱下，许多青年抱着当专家当领导干部等名利打算，考入北大。
    从学生入学的头一天起，陆平黑帮便从各方面努力把他们培养成为资产阶级的接班人。
    第一，陆平黑帮阻挠和破坏群众自觉学习毛主席著作的运动。一九五八年以后和一九六四年以后，群众两次自觉掀起学习毛主席著作的高潮，都被陆平黑帮破坏了。陆平黑帮的用心是极其狠毒的，他们对毛泽东思想怀有刻骨的仇恨，因为他们很清楚，毛泽东思想一旦被广大群众所掌握，他们的修正主义便难以掩盖，他们搞资本主义复辟的阴谋也就要破产了。
    第二，陆平黑帮实行资产阶级的“天才教育”。在招生考试时，他们就注意选拔“尖子”，不问其政治情况如何，只要是“尖子”，就会得到欣赏、重视。凡是他们认为有“培养前途”的“高材生”，则给以种种特殊照顾，指定有经验的教师精心加以培养。甚至有的右派学生，被认为有外语天才，特地派两个教师为他辅导学习第三种外国语。他们完全是以业务挂帅，有一位资产阶级学者对这种教育方法作了这样的描述：“譬如浮水过河，浮过去的就能到达对岸，浮不过去的只好淹死”。许多青年被他们引到走资产阶级个人奋斗，追逐个人名利的道路上去。
    第三，通过课堂，向学生系统地灌输资产阶级思想、修正主义思想，宣扬资产阶级、封建阶级腐朽颓废的人生观，毒害青年学生，使他们思想上慢慢发生演变。有些同学回忆他们所受毒害的经过时说，他们对于资产阶级的东西有一个“三部曲”：厌恶、适应、追求。外语某系有几位同学，刚入学时要求进步，对学校的歪风邪气不满，经过几年，这几个人都比原来退步了。学了大量西方资产阶级的东西，吃、喝、玩、乐一套都学会了。每届毕业的前夕，在学生中出现极复杂的思想情况，贪图安逸，留恋大城市，怕到边远地区，怕参加体力劳动，成为较普遍的现象。
    第四，陆平黑帮还竭力引诱青年教师走资产阶级成名成家的道路。一九六二年陆平制定了一个“师资培养办法”，规定了助教、讲师、副教授、教授之间森严的等级制度和提升的条件。这纯粹是一个资产阶级的业务挂帅的办法。陆平黑帮解释说，“只要政治上不反党反社会主义”，而在业务上符合“办法”的要求，就可以提升学衔。他们取消了教师的政治标准，要教师专门去为争取学衔、争取个人名利而奋斗。
    陆平还在全校选了八十七名教师作为培养重点，让他们基本上脱离教学工作，关门读书，写文章。他们中许多人只专不红，有些人政治极端落后，或者有系统的修正主义思想。
    第五，陆平黑帮把青年教师和研究生的培养完全交给资产阶级教授。从一九五九年开始，陆平就让青年教师与老教授“对号”，以老教授作为追赶目标。有不少人被资产阶级专家潜移默化拉下了水。有些青年人跟随资产阶级专家搞著作、搞翻译，发了洋财之后，便对政治进步的要求逐渐淡薄了。他们逐渐变成资产阶级专家的第二代。
    研究生的选拔和培养也放手交给资产阶级教授，放弃了管理和政治思想工作，使许多研究生接受了资产阶级学者的教育思想、学术思想和生活方式。他们之中许多人只钻业务，不问政治，成了精神贵族。
    在北大，资产阶级和无产阶级争夺青年一代的斗争是极其尖锐复杂的，是你死我活的。
    我们党的教育方针，是彻底革命的方针，是为彻底消灭三大差别，彻底消灭一切剥削阶级和剥削制度的残余服务的。因此，党的教育方针一提出，就遭到那些反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物和一切牛鬼蛇神的拚命反抗。陆平黑帮在北京大学实行的一切反革命措施，都是针对我们党的教育方针的，他们竭力保留、加深和扩大三大差别，积蓄力量等待时机，在我国全面恢复资本主义的剥削制度。我们必须从同陆平反革命黑帮的斗争中吸取教训。我们要坚定不移地高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极地参加无产阶级文化大革命，坚决贯彻执行党的教育方针，彻底改革旧的教育制度，彻底改造旧北大，彻底清算陆平黑帮反动的资产阶级教育路线，彻底挖掉北京大学的修正主义根子。
