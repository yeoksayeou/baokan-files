In the wake of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's July 17th issuance of his "Letter to the Nation," the entire North Vietnam, from the capital to the countryside, from the mountains to the coasts, has seen its 17 million heroic people hold meetings and demonstrations over the past few days, enthusiastically responding to and resolutely carrying out Chairman Ho's great battle call. They are determined to overcome all hardships and sacrifices to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

Over the past three days, hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians in the capital Hanoi have participated in various meetings and demonstrations. 260,000 young people in Hanoi have unanimously expressed their full support for the nation's partial mobilization order, ready to enlist at any time and march to the front lines. All reserve officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers have ensured they are fully equipped and ready to go. 270,000 women in Hanoi wrote to Chairman Ho, stating: "No matter how the American aggressors bomb Hanoi, no matter what difficulties we encounter in production and life, we will resolutely complete the 'three responsibilities' and carry the anti-American, national salvation struggle to the end."

The people and armed forces of major cities such as Hai Phong, Nam Dinh, and Thai Nguyen have also been holding meetings and demonstrations since July 17th. The vast number of young people, workers, cadres, and students in these cities, upon hearing the nation's partial mobilization order, immediately volunteered to enlist. Representatives of 160,000 young people in Hai Phong held a "Military Enlistment Assembly," ready to enlist and march to the front lines to fight the enemy.

The people of various ethnic groups, militia, and armed forces in various provinces and regions of North Vietnam gathered in tens of thousands around radios and loudspeakers in the early hours of July 17th to listen to Chairman Ho's "Letter to the Nation" and the partial mobilization order. They spread the word that day, holding meetings in battle positions, factories, and fields, expressing their enthusiastic response and resolute execution of Chairman Ho's call. The people and soldiers in the provinces of Ha Tay, Phu Tho, Quang Ninh, and Ninh Binh also held mass oath-taking assemblies. The people and soldiers fighting in the forward areas of the Vinh Linh district and the provinces of Quang Binh, Nghe An, and Ha Tinh also held meetings and demonstrations. The young people of various ethnic groups in the province of Lao Cai, near the Vietnam-China border, held a meeting stating: They have made all preparations, and as soon as the motherland gives the order, they will march to the front lines and resolutely annihilate the American aggressors!

The people from the South who have gathered in North Vietnam, upon hearing Chairman Ho's great battle call, were extremely moved and their fighting spirit soared. At their meetings, they unanimously passed a resolution to Chairman Ho stating: We are always ready to return to the South to fight, and we will resolutely and thoroughly annihilate the American aggressors.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, July 19th - The newspapers "Nhan Dan" and "Tien Phong" both published editorials praising the four million young people in North Vietnam for resolutely responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's battle call and the partial mobilization order, eagerly volunteering to enlist, and being ready to march to the front lines to strike the American aggressors at any time.

The editorial in "Nhan Dan" on July 19th stated, since the American imperialists suffered a humiliating defeat in South Vietnam and crazily expanded their destructive war to the North, the broad masses of young people in Vietnam, with the high determination of "defeating the American aggressors," have enthusiastically participated in the "three preparations" movement. In the past two years, hundreds of thousands of young people have eagerly enlisted, tens of thousands of young men and women have joined the "Anti-American, National Salvation Youth Shock Brigades," and millions of young men and women have eagerly joined the militia and self-defense forces. They have made active contributions to defending the motherland and production on various fronts.

The editorial said, since July 17th, young people from all walks of life across Vietnam have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Ho's call and the partial mobilization order with boundless excitement and pride. Young people across the country have unanimously pledged: Reserve officers and soldiers are ready to re-enlist at any time; young members of the Labor Youth League and young volunteers will enlist, ready to go to any place the motherland needs to strike the American aggressors.

The editorial said, the youth of the entire nation will, together with the whole people, turn the Party and the state's determination into the determination of the broad masses, turn Chairman Ho's call to resist America and save the nation into actual actions, resolutely become the Party's capable assistants and the revolutionary shock troops, and become the successors of the nation's heroic cause.

The editorial in "Tien Phong" on July 18th stated, the youth of Vietnam are determined to lead the implementation of Chairman Ho's call, lead the implementation of the call of the Supreme National Defense Council. The editorial said, the young generation of Vietnam is a generation of heroes who are always ready to sacrifice for the motherland and for the lofty revolutionary ideals. The youth of Vietnam have an invincible weapon, which is the people's war of revolution and the sufficient strength and willpower to definitely defeat the American aggressors.
