Editor's Note: The clay sculpture "The Rent Collection Courtyard," born in the great proletarian cultural revolution, is an unprecedented and great innovation in the history of Chinese sculpture. It has been approved by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and has been warmly welcomed by audiences both domestically and internationally. The success of "The Rent Collection Courtyard" once again vividly demonstrates the brilliant victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought.

Mao Zedong Thought armed the minds of the creators of "The Rent Collection Courtyard," illuminating their path of ideological transformation and artistic creation. They followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "make one's works welcome by the masses by transforming and reforming one's thoughts and emotions." They focused on the fundamental issue of worldview transformation, seriously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, humbly learning from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and uniting with them in thought and emotion. Therefore, they were able to create artistic works warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Because they armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, they dared to think, act, and revolutionize during the creation process. They dared to thoroughly break away from the frameworks revered as sacred by the bourgeoisie, establishing something new for socialism and something different for the proletariat, and opening up a new era for proletarian sculpture in China. All revolutionary literary and artistic workers, as long as they firmly follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, will definitely create more and better brilliant works worthy of our great era.

Sculpture and Revolution

Chairman Mao taught revolutionary literary and artistic workers in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "Our literature and art are for the people, first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for them and used by them." However, for many years, under the control and influence of the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought bourgeois literary and artistic black line represented by Zhou Yang, Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line was not only not implemented but also met with resistance and opposition. Take sculpture, for example. A small group of so-called bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" in sculpture stubbornly clung to their old ways, saying, "The revolution has ruined sculpture," "politics cannot produce art," and "politics has turned art into models." Therefore, they strongly resisted the revolution in sculpture. However, the majority of revolutionary comrades believed that "politics must lead art, and with the great development of socialist revolution, sculpture must keep up with the times and undergo a great revolution."

The essence of the problem is not a dispute between large memorials and small sculptures, nor between stone carvings, wood carvings, and clay sculptures. It is a dispute over which path sculpture should take, whether it should serve proletarian politics or bourgeois politics.

When we first took on the task of "The Rent Collection Courtyard," some comrades thought it was "hopeless," "just making illustrations and models, with no artistic value," and "even if it's good, no one will know about it in the countryside." What is this about? It is about whether art serves proletarian politics, socialism, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers, or whether it serves the personal fame and profit of the bourgeoisie. In response to these active thoughts, the leadership instructed us to seriously study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." We have read this speech countless times, but each time we learn something new. This time, sitting in the rent collection courtyard and studying with questions in mind, we gained a deeper understanding. We felt that in the past, our sculptures were not created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, let alone used by them. This creation was a good opportunity to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We should abandon all selfish thoughts, wholeheartedly listen to Chairman Mao's words, and let sculpture serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, so that farmers can see, understand, and appreciate it. After studying the speech, everyone felt that "The Rent Collection Courtyard" had great potential.

However, creating such a magnificent sculpture as "The Rent Collection Courtyard" was a first for us: it was the first time we consciously used Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought to guide our creation; the first time we directly depicted such a major class struggle theme; the first time we sculpted such a large continuous narrative of figures; the first time we used a combination of "native" and "foreign" sculpting methods; the first time so many people worked together in a collective creation...

A first time—this means no experience and great difficulties. What should we do? Should we not do it? Should we retreat? No! Chairman Mao taught us: We are doing what our predecessors have not done. We should resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, dare to think, dare to venture, and dare to do, to open up our own path and engage in a new proletarian cause. Revolutionaries have always been fearless in the face of difficulties, and it is shameful to retreat. The leadership said well, "Don't be afraid to revolutionize sculpture, and if you fail, at most it's just a pile of clay. Summarize the experience and start over!" At the same time, the leadership also taught us to rely on three treasures: Chairman Mao's works, the Party's leadership, and the help of the peasant masses. With these three treasures, there is no difficulty we cannot overcome.

Flipping through the history of Chinese sculpture, it is full of ancient Buddhas; flipping through the history of Western sculpture, it is full of foreign Buddhas. Some people's minds are filled with Greece, Rome, the Northern Wei, the Tang Dynasty, Jesus, the Virgin Mary, David, Venus, Buddha, and Guanyin. They are infatuated with and worship these imperial kings, generals, scholars, and beauties from the West and the past, praising them as the world's pinnacle and exaggerating them beyond belief. For more than a decade since liberation, although some images of workers, peasants, and soldiers have been sculpted, they are still Davids and Venuses dressed in workers', peasants', and soldiers' clothing. Foreign dogmas have become golden rules, and the tiger's ass is untouchable.

Chairman Mao said: "In literature and art, the uncritical hard imitation and copying of ancient and foreign works are the most unpromising and harmful literary and artistic dogmatism." "Foreign Buddhas" and "ancient Buddhas" are not easily shattered. Improving on the basis of "foreign" and "ancient" is absolutely not acceptable. We made up our minds to have a thorough revolution, from content to form, inside and out, completely new.

Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, we dare to despise the so-called world's pinnacle in creation. Whether it is the "Renaissance" of the West or the "heyday" of the Tang Dynasty in China, even if it is praised to the sky, it is still feudalism and bourgeoisie, not proletarian. They are nothing special and are not unattainable. We firmly believe that as long as we follow the direction indicated in Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," we can climb new heights in the world.

Transforming Emotions

Chairman Mao said: "We intellectuals who are literary and artistic workers must transform and reform our thoughts and emotions to make our works welcome by the masses. Without this transformation and reform, nothing can be done well, and everything will be out of place." Throughout the creation of the sculpture "The Rent Collection Courtyard," we deeply felt that only by bringing a strong desire for ideological transformation and deeply entering the masses, learning from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, transforming our thoughts and emotions, loving what the workers, peasants, and soldiers love, and hating what they hate, can we create sculptures permeated with proletarian emotions. Only sculptures permeated with proletarian emotions can give the audience class education.

The sculpture "The Rent Collection Courtyard" began in June last year and ended in October. From planting rice to harvesting and paying public grain, in front of the courtyard, the commune's threshing machine roared, and the queue to pay public grain passed by the door. Group after group of commune members, with happy and joyful smiles, entered the rent collection courtyard to see our sculptures, and with excited tears, they left. A heaven and a hell, the contrast between before and after liberation is so stark! For us young authors, who are on average under thirty years old, it is difficult to understand and imagine.

The peasants said: "Now when we hear the threshing machine, our hearts are joyful. Before liberation, when the threshing machine roared, the landlord had gold and silver, and the peasants had tears flowing." The peasants said: "Now holding the handle of the sickle means a bumper harvest; before liberation, dropping the handle of the sickle meant begging." The peasants said: "Now paying public grain, our feet are like oiled, running fast; before liberation, giving rent to the landlord was like carrying a mountain, unable to walk."

Cold Yueying told us about her experience of being pulled into a water prison for not paying enough rent and cried uncontrollably. Luo Erni showed us the scars on her breasts, accusing Liu Wenhai of forcing her to be a wet nurse, biting her until blood flowed. Han Dama, recalling her husband being drafted and dragging her children to beg for food, could not stop crying. Old peasants also told us stories of fighting against oppression, such as carrying corpses to the court, going to the mountains to fight guerrillas, etc. The contrast between past and present, love and hate, was so strong. They not only provided us with rich life materials but, more importantly, gave us a profound lesson in class struggle and emotional understanding. From the beginning to the end of the work, they educated us ideologically, supported us materially, supervised us, helped us, acted as our consultants, and served as references for our sculpting. This made some comrades feel ashamed and regretful for their past experiences of going to the countryside to "experience life," collecting materials for creation for personal fame and profit; it also made us understand why past sculptures lacked emotion and why the emotion they had was not that of the laboring people.

In the past, we often put on the airs of "artists," being "observers" in front of life and "educators" in front of the masses, actually reversing the first and second things. Summarizing past experiences and lessons, based on Chairman Mao's instructions and the leadership's guidance, we must set the direction correctly and correct our attitudes. This requires us: to study Chairman Mao's books first and professional books later; to have ideological revolution first and sculpture revolution later; to be educated first and to educate others later; to have ideological transformation first and to experience life later. In short, to use Mao Zedong Thought to lead everything. Therefore, as soon as we arrived at the landlord's mansion exhibition hall in Daxian, Sichuan, we first studied Chairman Mao's works and then began our work. First, we received education as "audience" by visiting the exhibition, not as "staff" to understand the situation. When visiting peasants, we first received class education and emotional influence, not to collect materials. When conceiving, designing, and making, we first thought of ourselves as the audience and then as the authors.

Because our thoughts and emotions have changed, we have begun to shift our standpoint to the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, whether in the overall design of the creation or in the specific handling, we can learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, always thinking from their perspective, striving to let the farmers see, understand, and appreciate. Take the embedding of eyeballs, for example. For a long time, there have been two foreign methods for making eyes: one is to make a spherical shape without a pupil, and the masses say it is "blind"; the other method is to dig a hole and use the shadow as a pupil, and the masses say it is "eye without soul." This time, we used the folk method to embed eyeballs. Some comrades initially felt uncomfortable, saying it "destroyed the overall feeling" and was "incoherent." After embedding, they also wanted to take it out. But the masses said it was "good," "bright," and "full of spirit." We followed the masses' opinion. After some time, the comrades who were uncomfortable also got used to it and felt it was very good.

The creation process of "The Rent Collection Courtyard" is a process of ideological transformation. It is a class for studying Chairman Mao's works and a training class for sculpture creation. We feel even more the great significance of studying Chairman Mao's works and learning from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and we understand the truth that emphasizing politics makes everything smooth.

Class Struggle, Class Standpoint, Class Emotion—One Line

Chairman Mao said: "We must look at the essence of things and regard their phenomena only as guides to entry. Once we enter, we must grasp their essence, and this is a reliable and scientific method of analysis." When we first went to the rent collection courtyard, although we lived there, we had not yet "entered the door" because we had not seen the essence of the rent collection courtyard. We only knew that this was the scene where peasants paid rent and landlords collected rent, and we thought it was not much different from a trading hall or a market. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's works, our understanding improved, and after interacting with thousands of peasants, we gradually understood and felt that this place was soaked with the blood and sweat of the peasants. The landlords' carved beams and painted rafters were all piled up with white bones, and the mountain delicacies and seafood they ate were all soaked in blood and tears. The rent collection courtyard was the main battlefield for landlords to exploit peasants. The peasants said, "The landlords' rent collection courtyard is the poor people's death gate." At the two ends of the rent collection courtyard, one end was debauchery and luxury; the other end was separation and death. At the same time of rent collection, the cruelty and laughter of the landlords and their henchmen were in sharp contrast to the peasants' misery and hatred, like fire and water! The rent collection courtyard was not a trading hall, and the peasants did not come here to go to the market. The rent collection courtyard was a battlefield of class struggle, the focal point of exploitation and oppression, and a matter of life and death. The process of rent collection was not a simple procedural process but a process of economic exploitation and political persecution by the landlord class against the peasants. Paying and collecting rent was a phenomenon, while class struggle was the essence. Only by deeply understanding this, we grasped the essence and truly "entered the door."

One thread. After grasping the thread of class struggle, what thread should we use to string together this 96-meter-long, 114-person queue, and in this complex phenomenon, find a clue? The easiest thread to find is paying rent—checking rent—threshing—measuring—accounting. But this is only a procedural thread. What this process expresses is the ideological thread, which is not easy to grasp. We learned to use the viewpoint and dialectical method of "On Contradiction" to understand and arrange the plot. The process of rent collection is the process of class struggle, the process of the development of contradictions. At the beginning, poor peasants endured hunger and were forced to hand over the fruits of their year-round labor to the landlord, under the surveillance of the landlord's henchmen, enemies meeting, especially resentful, suppressing a full chest of anger, contradictions hidden. After going through the checks of rent, threshing, and measuring, the landlord's cunning and vicious methods of exploitation ignited the peasants' suppressed anger, and contradictions gradually unfolded. When it came to accounting, the contradictions reached a boiling point, with the peasant masses on one side and the big landlord and evil tyrant Liu Wenhai and his henchmen on the other, standing in sharp opposition. But under the suppression of the reactionaries' gun barrels and seals, the peasants suffered cruel persecution, which was the situation of forced rent collection. The contradiction did not end but was brewing new contradictions, that is, the peasants' road to struggle and revolution. From low to high, and then from high to higher, the ups and downs were not only for artistic effects but also the inevitable law of the development of things. From the first old woman suffering deeply to the last young peasant who realized that only revolution was the way out, the development of contradictions from spontaneous to conscious, from struggling to death to revolution, from quantitative change to qualitative change. In this way, the origin and result, the cause and effect, had a dialectical logical connection, and the plot and the red thread running through it were clear. The facts taught us: unity in diversity, ups and downs, and other artistic forms must have, but more importantly, the thought guiding this change. Without Mao Zedong Thought guiding, the more than 100 people in "The Rent Collection Courtyard" would not be able to stand in line, and it would definitely be chaotic. With Chairman Mao's works guiding us, it was like a key opening a thousand locks to solve the problem.

One Rent Collection Courtyard and the Entire Old Society. "Liu Wenhai is Liu Wenhai" and "The Rent Collection Courtyard is the Rent Collection Courtyard." Our mechanical view was overcome only after studying "On Contradiction" and "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society." Liu Wenhai did not exist in isolation; he had complex class and social relations. He was a warlord, bureaucrat, landlord, and reactionary sectarian "four-in-one" big tyrant, colluding with imperialism and also a capitalist. He held a gun in one hand and a seal in the other. This was a typical product of semi-feudal, semi-colonial old China. It was very important to express this. In fact, one rent collection courtyard was a microcosm of the entire old society. In the "Forced Rent Collection" section, when designing the negative characters of the conscription and house search incident, we initially used only two landlord henchmen. After understanding the class and social relations of the old society, we brought out all kinds of characters, from a single henchman to eleven kinds of negative characters. The bodyguards of Liu Wenhai included reactionary officers, bandit leaders, and sectarian thugs, as well as high-level henchmen like accountants and low-level dogs like wind workers. The appearance of various negative characters more deeply reflected the class and social essence and enriched the character images. Rent collection was a typical event, the rent collection courtyard was a typical environment, and Liu Wenhai was a typical character. Grasping the typical to reveal the essence, using the particular to represent the general, could make one represent ten, and from one rent collection courtyard, one could see the entire old society.

Standing today, recalling yesterday, for tomorrow. What effect should the audience achieve after seeing "The Rent Collection Courtyard"? Initially, some comrades only thought of the word "cry." They thought that if the audience could be moved to tears, it would be great. Indeed, few sculpture works can make the audience shed tears. But is this our pursuit? No. Haven't some bad works deceived the audience's tears with bourgeois humanitarianism? We have seen a bias, that is, one-sidedly and excessively exaggerating misery and horror to win the audience's sympathy and tears. We also had this bias in our creation. In the initial draft design, there appeared peasants begging and pleading with the landlord, lacking the spirit of "poor but hard-boned" and "poor but not poor in spirit," lacking the spirit of resistance and struggle, and the motive was to move the audience to tears. There were also comrades who advocated bringing out all of Liu Wenhai's cruel punishments, gouging eyes, cutting ears, and disemboweling, and the motive was also to move the audience. Such one-sidedness and superficiality, pursuing sensory stimulation, not deeply exposing class struggle, economic exploitation, and political persecution, would inevitably slip into naturalism, old realism, and bourgeois "humanism." Chairman Mao said: "In class society, there is only classed humanity." Today's audience is the audience of the socialist era. They visit "The Rent Collection Courtyard" to receive class education, not just to shed tears. They are in the socialist society, recalling the bitterness of the old society, fighting for the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and for the complete liberation of mankind. In other words, the audience stands today, recalls yesterday, and fights for tomorrow. If we do not clarify the relationship between "today," "yesterday," and "tomorrow," we will not only fail to use the creative method of combining revolutionary realism with revolutionary romanticism but may also make dangerous and wrong mistakes. After study and debate, our understanding improved, developing from the word "cry" to the three words "cry, hate, and spirit." That is, recalling the bitterness of the old society, hating the reactionaries, loving the Party and Chairman Mao, and striving for the Chinese revolution and world revolution with full spirit. In general, we should express both the brutality and cowardice of the landlord class and their weakness and fear; we should express both the misery and suffering of the peasants and their hatred and resistance; we should express both the cruel reality at that time and the bright future. Let the audience see one rent collection courtyard and think of the entire old society, and then connect it with today's revolutionary struggle around the world.

The inner determines the outer, and the outer reflects the inner. Chairman Mao said: "In class society, every person lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are stamped with the mark of class." This is our guiding ideology for analyzing, understanding, and sculpting the characters in "The Rent Collection Courtyard." This class mark is stamped on the inner thoughts and emotions, as well as on the outer appearance and actions. The relationship between inner and outer is: the inner determines the outer, and the outer reflects the inner. For example, the blind old peasant, he is blind, a poor peasant, and he should have the characteristics of a laborer. Because he could not pay enough rent, he was forced to sell his little granddaughter. His heart is full of sorrow, bitterness, and hatred. His actions and expressions from head to toe should be sorrowful, bitter, and hateful. Again, for example, the guard at the door, listless and empty, he seems indifferent to the living being dragged in and the dead being carried out beside him, his eyelids drooping, looking nowhere, a vulgar appearance. This attitude of "bystander" towards others' separation and death is precisely to expose his special ugly soul. Again, for example, the last young peasant, he is full of class hatred, realizing that only revolution is the way out. His right fist is clenched as if sweating, and the pole in his left hand seems to have already become a gun. His angry gaze is directed at the place of accounting, and his heart seems to be saying: "Wait and see, there will be a time for us to settle accounts with you!"

The Approval of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers is the Highest Award

During the sculpting of "The Rent Collection Courtyard," news spread far and wide, and many peasants came in groups from hundreds of miles away to see it. They watched with strong class emotions and returned with strong class emotions. They said: "Without explanation, it is clear and clear"; "This is the statue made for us"; "It speaks for us and speaks for us."

Workers said: "Workers and peasants are one family. The bitterness of peasants is our bitterness. We will never forget class bitterness and will always remember blood and tears. We will carry the revolution to the end."

Soldiers said: "The landlord class and reactionaries oppress and exploit peasants because they hold the seals and guns. Now the seals and guns are in our hands. We will definitely hold our guns tightly and defend the people's mountains and rivers."

Some audience members wrote in the comment book: "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

These comments are different from the language of critics. They have no so many adjectives, but they are full of proletarian emotions. They are both accurate and practical. We believe this is the highest evaluation, more precious than any award.

The facts educate us: the revolution needs revolutionary sculpture, and workers, peasants, and soldiers need revolutionary sculpture to serve them. However, under the control of those bourgeois "authorities" and "experts," sculpture creation does not serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers at all. Therefore, we must carry out the revolution in sculpture to create revolutionary sculpture works, making sculpture art "become a part of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, strike the enemy, and annihilate the enemy."

The success of "The Rent Collection Courtyard" is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought; it is the fruit of the great proletarian cultural revolution; it is the product of the combination of leadership, masses, and authors; it is the crystallization of the collective labor of professional and amateur workers. Through this creation, we have felt: only the art created according to Chairman Mao's instructions is proletarian revolutionary art. Only the works approved by workers, peasants, and soldiers are good revolutionary works. The life of workers, peasants, and soldiers is our source, workers, peasants, and soldiers are our service objects, and workers, peasants, and soldiers are the best connoisseurs.

The Mao Zedong era is an era of heroes. We need to enthusiastically sing the praises of brilliant deeds and heroes like Daqing, Dazhai, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Jiao Yulu. In revolutionary history, we need to powerfully depict stories like the Long March, anti-Japanese heroes, revolutionary martyrs, anti-American struggles, and anti-bourgeois exploitation and oppression. Let us hoist high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, and advance bravely!

### 先革思想的命　再革雕塑的命

　　先革思想的命　再革雕塑的命
　　雕塑《收租院》创作组
    编者按：在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中诞生的泥塑《收租院》，是我国雕塑史上一个空前的、伟大的创举。它已经得到广大工农兵群众的批准，在国内外观众中受到了极大的欢迎。《收租院》创作的成功，再一次极其生动地显示了毛泽东文艺思想的光辉胜利。
    毛泽东思想武装了《收租院》作者的头脑，照亮了他们思想改造和艺术创作的道路。他们遵循着毛主席“要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造”的教导，首先在世界观改造这一根本问题上狠下功夫，认真活学活用毛主席著作，虚心向工农兵群众学习，并且从思想感情上和工农兵群众打成一片。因此，他们就能创作出为广大工农兵热烈欢迎的艺术作品。
    正因为用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，他们在创作过程中，就敢想、敢干、敢闯、敢革命，敢于彻底破除资产阶级“权威”奉为神明的条条框框，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，开创了我国无产阶级雕塑艺术的新时代。一切革命的文艺工作者，只要象《收租院》的作者一样，坚定地沿着毛主席所指引的方向前进，一定会创造出更多更好的无愧于我们伟大时代的光辉作品。
          雕塑和革命
    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中教导革命文艺工作者：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”可是，多少年来，在以周扬为代表的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级文艺黑线的控制和影响下，毛主席的文艺路线，不仅没有得到贯彻，而且遭到他们的抵制和反对。就以雕塑艺术来说，一小批资产阶级的所谓雕塑“专家”、“权威”，顽固地死抱住他们老一套不放，说“革命把雕塑革得没有命了”，“政治不能出艺术”，“政治把艺术变成了模型”。因此他们极力抵制雕塑革命。而大多数革命同志则认为“政治必须统帅艺术，社会主义革命大发展，雕塑艺术要跟上形势，必须来一次大革命”。
    问题的实质不是作大纪念碑和小型雕塑之争，也不是石刻、木雕和泥塑之争，而是雕塑艺术走什么样的道路之争，是雕塑为无产阶级政治服务和为资产阶级政治服务之争。
    我们刚接受《收租院》任务时，有同志认为“没有搞头”，“是作图解，搞模型，没有艺术性”，“在农村搞，再好也没人知道。”这是什么问题？这是艺术为无产阶级政治服务、为社会主义服务、为工农兵服务呢，还是为资产阶级个人名利服务的问题。针对这些活思想，领导指示我们认真学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。这篇讲话我们不知读过多少遍，但每学一次都有新的收获。这次我们坐在收租院里带着问题学，体会更深。我们觉得，过去，我们的雕塑，没有为工农兵而创作，更谈不上为工农兵所利用。这次创作，正是为工农兵服务的好时机。我们应该抛弃一切私心杂念，一心一意听毛主席的话，让雕塑艺术为工农兵所利用，让农民看得到，看得懂，看得好。学了《讲话》，大家都觉得《收租院》“大有搞头”了。
    但是，创作《收租院》这样宏伟的雕塑，对我们说来是头一回：头一回自觉地用毛主席文艺思想指导我们的创作；头一回直接表现这样重大的阶级斗争题材；头一回塑造这样庞大的情节连续的群象；头一回采用“土”“洋”结合的雕塑办法；头一回这样多方面的人在一起集体创作……。
    头一回——这意味着没有经验，困难很大。怎么办？我们就不做了吗？就打退堂鼓吗？不！毛主席教导说：我们正在做前人所没有做过的事情。我们应该坚决听毛主席的话，敢想、敢闯、敢做，去开辟自己的道路，去做无产阶级崭新的事业。革命者从来是知难而进的，在困难面前畏缩不前，是可耻的懦怯者。
    革命没有不费劲的，没有困难就说不上革命。领导说得好，“革雕塑的命不要怕失败，失败了，充其量是堆泥，总结经验再重来！”同时，领导还教育我们要紧紧依靠三样宝：毛主席著作，党的领导，农民群众的帮助。有这三样宝，就没有克服不了的困难。
    翻开中国雕刻史，尽是古菩萨；翻开西洋雕刻史，尽是洋菩萨。有些人心目中只有希腊、罗马、北魏、唐代，只有耶稣、圣母、大卫、维纳斯、佛爷、观音。他们对这些洋的古的帝王将相、才子佳人的作品倾倒拜服，捧为世界高峰，吹得神乎其神。解放十几年来，虽然雕塑了一些工农兵形象，但仍然是穿工农兵衣服的大卫和维纳斯，洋教条变成了金科玉律，老虎的屁股摸不得。
    毛主席说：“文学艺术中对于古人和外国人的毫无批判的硬搬和模仿，乃是最没有出息的最害人的文学教条主义和艺术教条主义。”“洋菩萨”和“古菩萨”不是很容易打碎的。在“洋”和“古”的基础上改良改良是绝对不行的。我们下定了决心，一定要来一个彻底大翻身，从内容到形式，里外翻新，彻底革命。
    毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，在创作上我们就敢于藐视所谓世界高峰。不论是西方的“文艺复兴”，也不论是中国唐代的“极盛时期”，说上了天，也是封建主义和资产阶级的，而不是无产阶级的。它们没什么了不起，更不是高不可攀。我们坚信：只要我们遵循毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中所指示的方向前进，我们就可以攀登世界新的高峰。
        使感情来一个变化
    毛主席说：“我们知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”在雕塑《收租院》的整个创作过程中，我们深深感到只有带着改造思想的强烈愿望深入群众，向工农兵群众学习，使自己的思想感情来一番变化，爱工农兵之所爱，憎工农兵之所憎，才能创作出渗透着无产阶级感情的雕塑，也只有渗透着无产阶级感情的雕塑，才能给观众以阶级教育。
    雕塑《收租院》是去年六月开始到十月结束的。从插秧到收割交公粮，就在收租院前的院坝里，公社的风谷机轰轰响，交公粮的队伍从门口络绎而过。一群群社员，带着幸福喜悦的笑脸跨进收租院来看我们塑象，又含着激动的泪花出去。一个天堂，一个地狱，解放前后，对比是多么强烈！对于我们这些平均年龄不到三十岁的青年作者说来，是难以体会和想象的。
    农民说：“现在一听风谷机响，心里欢畅。解放前哪，风谷机响，地主是黄金万两，农民是眼泪长淌。”　
    农民说：“现在捏着镰刀把儿就丰收；解放前哪，丢下镰刀把儿就讨口（收割完毕，交租以后，被迫外出乞讨）。”　　　　　　　
    农民说：“现在交公粮，脚板象抹上清油跑得快；解放前哪，给地主交租象扛一座山，走不动。”
    冷月英给我们讲述她因交不够地租被拉去坐水牢的情景时痛哭不止。罗二娘露出奶头上的伤痕控诉刘文彩逼她当奶妈、咬得她鲜血直流的罪行。阚大娘讲到她丈夫被抓壮丁，拖儿带女去讨饭时就泣不成声。老农民还给我们讲述万人抬尸闹公堂，上山打游击等斗争故事。……今昔对比，爱憎强烈，他们不仅给我们提供了丰富的生活素材，更重要的是在阶级斗争观念上和思想感情上给我们上了深刻的一课。从工作开始到结束，他们给我们以思想上的教育，物质上的支援，督促我们，帮助我们，当我们的顾问，作我们塑造形象的参考。这些，使一些同志对以往下乡“体验生活”，捞素材搞创作为个人名利服务，感到痛心和惭愧；也使我们懂得了为什么过去的雕塑没有感情，有了感情又不是劳动人民的感情的原因所在。
    过去我们常常摆出“艺术家”的架子，在生活面前是“观察家”，在群众面前是“教育者”，实际上把第一位和第二位的东西颠倒了。总结以往的经验教训，根据毛主席的教导，根据领导的指示，必须把方向摆准，态度放正。这要求我们：学习毛主席的书在前，学业务书在后；思想革命在前，雕塑革命在后；受教育在前，教育别人在后；思想改造在前，体验生活在后。总之，用毛泽东思想来统帅业务，统帅一切。因此，我们一到四川大邑地主庄园陈列馆，先学毛主席著作，然后开始工作。先以“观众”身份参观展览受教育，而不是以“工作人员”的身份了解情况。访问农民时，首先受阶级教育和阶级感情的熏陶，而不是捞素材。在构思设计和制作的时候，先想到自己是观众，然后才是作者。
    正因为我们的思想感情有了变化，开始把立足点移到工农兵方面来了，所以我们不论在创作的总体设计上，或是具体的处理上，都能以工农兵为师，处处从工农兵角度着想，力求让农民看到、看懂和看好。就以嵌眼珠来说，长期以来作眼睛有两个洋办法，一个是作个球形不作瞳孔，群众看了说是“睁眼瞎”；一个办法是挖个洞，利用阴影作瞳孔，群众说是“有眼无珠”。这次我们采用民间土办法嵌眼珠，有的同志起初感到不习惯，说“破坏了整体感”“不协调”，嵌进去了也想取出来。可是群众说“好”，“有光彩，有种气”，我们就按群众的意见办。过些时候，不习惯的同志也习惯了，而且觉得好得很。
    《收租院》创作过程是思想改造的过程。它是学习毛主席著作训练班，也是雕塑创作训练班。我们更加感到学习毛主席著作，向工农兵群众学习的伟大意义，也体会到突出政治一通百通的道理。
      阶级斗争、阶级观点、阶级感情
    一条纲。毛主席说：“我们看事情必须要看它的实质，而把它的现象只看作入门的向导，一进了门就要抓住它的实质，这才是可靠的科学的分析方法。”我们刚去收租院的时候，虽然住在收租院里，但是并没有“入门”，因为没有看到收租院的实质，只知道这是农民交租、地主收租的现场，还以为跟一个交易所、集市没有多大区别。后来学习了毛主席著作，提高了认识，和上千个农民接触，才逐渐了解和感觉到这个地方浸透了多少农民的血汗。地主住的雕梁画栋全是白骨堆起，吃的山珍海味尽是血泪泡成，而收租院正是地主剥削农民的主要关口。农民说“地主收租院，穷人催命关”。在收租院的两端，一端是荒淫无耻，富贵豪华；一端是生离死别，家破人亡。在收租的同一个时候，地主及其爪牙们的残暴和奸笑与农民的悲苦和仇恨感情是多么尖锐的对立，水火不容！收租院不是交易所，农民不是到这里来赶集。收租院是阶级斗争场地，是剥削压迫与被剥削压迫的焦点所在，是生死关口。收租院的收租过程不是简单的事务过程，是地主阶级对农民进行经济剥削与政治迫害的过程。交租收租是现象，阶级斗争才是实质。只有深刻理解了这一点，才抓住了实质，真正上了“纲”。
    一根线。抓到了阶级斗争这个纲，用一根什么线把这九十六米长、一百一十四个人的队伍串起来，在这繁杂的现象中理出一个头绪呢？最容易找到的线是交租——验租——风谷——过斗——算账。但这只是一条事务性的线。通过这个过程表现什么，这才是思想性的线，不容易抓住的线。我们学着运用《矛盾论》的观点，辩证的方法去认识和安排情节。收租的过程就是阶级斗争的过程，矛盾发展的过程。一开始贫苦农民忍饥挨饿被迫将终年劳动的果实给地主交来，受到狗腿子的监视，仇人相见，分外眼红，积压着满腔怒火，矛盾隐蔽着。经过验租、风谷、过斗几道关，地主奸猾阴险的剥削手段把农民积压的怒火引燃，矛盾逐渐展开。到了算账的时候，矛盾白热化，以农民群众为一方，以大地主恶霸刘文彩及其爪牙为一方，尖锐地对峙。但在反动派的枪杆子印把子镇压下，农民遭到残酷的迫害，这就是逼租的情况。矛盾并未结束，却酝酿着新的矛盾，那就是农民走向斗争和革命的道路。由低潮逐渐到高潮，再由高潮到更高潮的起伏变化，不仅是为了求得艺术上的效果，同时它本来就是事物发展的必然规律。从第一个苦难深重的孤老太婆起，到最末一个觉悟到只有革命才是出路的壮年农民止，在矛盾斗争中发展，从自发到自觉，从拚命到革命，从量变到质变。这样，来龙去脉，前因后果，就有了一个辩证逻辑的联系，不仅故事情节清楚，贯穿情节的红线也清楚了。事实教育我们：多样统一、起伏变化等这些艺术形式上的东西必须有，但更重要的是指导这种变化的思想。没有毛泽东思想指导，《收租院》里一百多个人是站不好队的，必定是杂乱无章。有了毛主席著作指导我们，就象一把钥匙通开千把锁那样解决问题。
    一个收租院和整个旧社会。“刘文彩就是刘文彩”“收租院就是收租院”。我们这种机械看法是学了《矛盾论》和《中国社会各阶级的分析》以后才克服的。刘文彩不是孤立地存在着，他有复杂的阶级关系和社会关系。他是一个军阀、官僚、地主、反动会道门“四位一体”的大恶霸，跟帝国主义也有勾结，还兼资本家。他一手拿枪，一手掌印。这正是旧中国半封建半殖民地的典型产物。表现这一点是十分重要的。实际上一个收租院是整个旧社会的缩影。“逼租”一段中，设计抓丁抄家这个情节的反面人物时，最初只用了两个地主狗腿子。认识到旧社会阶级和社会关系以后，就拉出了各色各样人物，从单一的狗腿子变成了十一种反面人物。给刘文彩保镖的就有反动军官、土匪头子和袍哥打手，有账房师爷那样“高级”的狗腿子和风风匠那样“低级”的走狗。各色各样的反派人物出现，更深刻地反映了阶级和社会本质，丰富了人物形象。收租是个典型事件，收租院是个典型环境，刘文彩是个典型人物。抓住典型揭示本质，以特殊体现一般，才能以一当十，才能从一个收租院看到整个旧社会。
    站在今天，回忆昨天，为了明天。让观众看了《收租院》以后达到什么效果，起初有些同志只想到一个“哭”字。认为能让观众感动得哭就是了不起。的确，雕塑作品能让观众看了掉眼泪的还很少。但这就是我们追求的目的吗？不是。有些坏作品不是用资产阶级人道主义骗取过观众的眼泪吗？我们曾见到过一种偏向，即片面过分地渲染悲惨和恐怖，以赢得观众的同情和眼泪。我们在创作中也曾出现过这种偏向。在初稿设计中，出现过农民向地主求饶讲情，缺乏“穷人骨头硬”“人穷志不穷”的气质，缺乏反抗斗争精神，动机是想让观众感动流泪。也有同志主张把刘文彩的残酷刑法全搬出来，挖眼睛，割耳朵，破肠肚，动机也是想让观众感动。这样的片面性和表面性，追求感官刺激，不深刻地从阶级斗争、经济剥削和政治迫害上去揭露，势必滑进自然主义、旧现实主义和资产阶级“人性论”的泥坑。毛主席说：“在阶级社会里就是只有带着阶级性的人性”。今天的观众是社会主义时代的观众。他们参观《收租院》，是为了受阶级教育，不是光为了掉眼泪。他们是身在社会主义社会，回忆旧社会的苦难，为了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，为了人类的彻底解放而奋斗的革命群众。就是说，观众是站在今天，回忆昨天，为了明天。不把“今天”、“昨天”和“明天”的关系弄清楚，不但不能运用革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，而且将会出现危险和错误。经过学习和辩论，认识提高了，由一个“哭”字发展到“哭、恨、劲”三个字。就是说，回忆旧社会的苦，仇恨反动派，热爱党和毛主席，鼓足干劲为中国革命和世界革命而奋斗。总的说来，既要表现地主阶级的残暴凶狠，也要表现他们的虚弱恐惧；既要表现农民的悲惨痛苦，也要表现他们的仇恨和反抗；既要表现当时的冷酷现实，也要预示光明未来。让观众看到一个收租院，联想整个旧社会，进而联系今天全世界的革命斗争。
    内决定外，外体现内。毛主席说：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”这是我们分析理解和塑造《收租院》人物的指导思想。这个阶级的烙印，打在内在思想感情上，也打在外部形体动作上。这个内外关系是：内决定外，外体现内。例如瞎子老农，他是瞎子，是贫苦农民，他要有劳动者的特征。他由于交不够租子，被迫卖了小孙女。内心充满着悲、苦、恨。他全身从头到脚的动作表情都应当悲、苦、恨。又例如守门的兵痞，委靡空虚，在他身旁活的拉进去，死的抬出来，于他似乎无动于衷，眼皮搭拉下来，哪儿也不看，一派下流相。这种对别人生离死别抱“旁观”的态度，正是要揭示他特殊的丑恶灵魂。再如最末一个壮年农民，他带着满腔的阶级仇恨，觉悟到只有革命才是出路，他右手拳头捏得象要出汗，左手提的扁担似乎已经是枪了，愤怒的目光直射算账的地方，心里似乎在说：“等着瞧，有我们给你算账的时候！”
        工农兵的批准是最高的奖励
    《收租院》塑造期间就远传千里，好多农民成群结队，从几百里以外前来观看。带着强烈的阶级感情看，带着强烈的阶级感情回去。他们说：“不用解说就看得一清二楚，明明白白”；“这是给我们塑的象”；“替我们控诉，替我们说话”。
    工人看了说：“工人农民是一家，农民的苦就是我们的苦，永远不忘阶级苦，永远牢记血泪仇，将革命进行到底。”
    解放军战士看了说：“地主阶级和反动派压迫剥削农民就是因为掌握了印把子和枪杆子，现在印把子枪杆子掌握在我们手里，一定紧握手中枪，捍卫人民的江山。”
    有的观众在留言簿上大书“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    这些评语与评论家的语言不同，没有那么多形容词，可是充满无产阶级的感情。既准确又实际。我们认为这是最崇高的评价，比什么奖赏都可贵。
    事实教育我们，革命是多么需要革命的雕塑，工农兵是多么需要革命的雕塑为他们服务。但是，在那些资产阶级的“权威”和“专家”把持下的雕塑创作，根本不为工农兵服务。因此，我们一定要进行雕塑革命，才能创作出革命的雕塑作品，使雕塑艺术“成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。
    《收租院》创作的成功，是毛泽东思想的胜利；是无产阶级文化大革命的成果；是领导、群众和作者三结合的产物；是专业和业余工作者集体劳动的结晶。通过这次创作，我们体会到：只有照毛主席指示创作出来的艺术才是无产阶级革命的艺术。只有工农兵批准的作品才是革命的好作品。工农兵生活是我们的源泉，工农兵是我们服务的对象，工农兵是最好的鉴赏家。
    毛泽东时代是英雄辈出的时代，象大庆、大寨、雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄那样光辉的事迹和英雄人物需要我们去热情歌颂。在革命历史上，象长征故事、抗日英雄、革命烈士、反美斗争、反资产阶级的剥削压迫，需要我们去大力表现。让我们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决贯彻毛主席的文艺路线，奋勇前进！
