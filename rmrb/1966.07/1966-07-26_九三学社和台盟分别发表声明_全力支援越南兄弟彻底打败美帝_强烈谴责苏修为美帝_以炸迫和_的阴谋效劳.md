	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, July 25th—The Jiusan Society issued a statement expressing that all members of the Jiusan Society resolutely respond to the call of our country's government. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, together with the people of the entire nation, they will support the Vietnamese people with practical actions. They will strive to the end to drive all U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam.

	The statement strongly condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership clique for serving the U.S. imperialists' plot of "bombing to force peace," playing a most disgraceful role. The statement says that the fate of the U.S. imperialists' complete failure in Vietnam is predetermined. All the demons and snakes serving the U.S. imperialists will not have a good ending.
