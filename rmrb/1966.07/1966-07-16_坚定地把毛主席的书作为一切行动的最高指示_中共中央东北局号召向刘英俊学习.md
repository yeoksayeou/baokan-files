Mao Zedong Thought is the brilliant, comprehensive, systematic, complete, and creative development of Marxism-Leninism, the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, and the most active and living Marxism-Leninism.

The notice points out: The People's Liberation Army is a heroic force personally created by Chairman Mao, a force that has been tested and proven to be highly proletarian and highly combat-ready. It is a model for actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The People's Liberation Army is not only a mighty armed force but also a productive and cultural force, a school for studying Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Liu Yingjun is a outstanding soldier who grew up in this great school under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. We must enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call, seriously learn from the People's Liberation Army, and forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Emphasize politics, adhere to the four firsts, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

All levels of party organizations must prioritize learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in all work, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, promote everything, and transform everything. Resolutely carry out the proletarian cultural revolution and socialist education in cities and countryside to the end, carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction to the end, thoroughly uproot the roots of capitalism, feudalism, and revisionism, make Mao Zedong Thought more widespread among the masses, and deepen its roots. Push the mass movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new height, ensure that our party and state will never change, and make the communist cause thrive forever.
