Chairman Mao's "Talk at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has been republished, and we, the broad masses of workers, are extremely excited. We read it over and over again, recite it over and over again. Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, illuminating the hearts of workers! Chairman Mao's brilliant work is a truth in every sentence, giving us great wisdom and strength. It issues a call to arms to the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and provides us with a powerful weapon for battle. Chairman Mao's brilliant work will forever be the highest directive for our literary and artistic work.

Since the founding of the nation, many literary and artistic departments have had their leadership usurped by bourgeois "authorities," who have been spreading feudal, capitalist, and revisionist ideas everywhere, attempting to prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." The bourgeois "authorities" use the forms of literature and art to launch a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism, dreaming of seizing the reins of power from the proletariat. This completely proves that Chairman Mao's teachings on the class nature of literature and art, and on class and class struggle, are infinitely correct and unshakable truths.

Chairman Mao also points out: "Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Looking back at our factory's literary and artistic activities, we deeply feel that whatever is done according to Chairman Mao's words, whatever is in line with Chairman Mao's directives, is correct and deeply welcomed by the broad masses of workers, and can make literature and art a powerful weapon for "uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy." Whatever goes against Chairman Mao's directives and engages in bourgeois revisionist nonsense like big, foreign, and old stuff, will inevitably lose its way and make mistakes.

In the past, our factory's cultural front has also been influenced by the bourgeois and revisionist black line in literature and art, staging many ghost plays and bad plays. These plays not only failed to have a positive effect but also spread feudal and capitalist poison among the worker masses. Since 1964, we have staged many revolutionary modern plays, and we have received great education. The ideological level of the entire factory's workers has also risen rapidly. We have come to realize that we must remember Chairman Mao's teachings and let literature and art serve proletarian politics. Only then can literature and art play a fighting role. We workers engaging in amateur literary and artistic activities must closely connect with the broad masses of workers, singing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought, the Party, socialism, and advanced individuals, which is the only correct direction. After clarifying the direction, we often combine propaganda with major political movements and use various forms of art to perform in the workshops, receiving praise from the broad masses of workers.

To support class education, we recently self-wrote and performed the sculpture play "The Opium Den." Many old workers, tears streaming down their faces, excitedly said: "This play speaks our hearts, we love to watch such plays." Many young people said: "Those landlord capitalists who eat people are too bad, watching this play has raised our awareness of class struggle, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow the Party forever!" Through this performance, we also received a profound education. We declare that we will forever be the main force on the literary and artistic front, and let revolutionary plays forever occupy our factory's cultural front!

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are developed in struggle. In the past, our factory workers have created some short and powerful revolutionary works, which are the victories of the Party and Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. They are the result of our holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fighting against the bourgeois and revisionist literary and artistic line represented by Zhou Yang. Today, we have restudied Chairman Mao's "Talk," and our minds are clearer, our eyes are brighter, and our revolutionary spirit is higher. We further realize: loving or not loving Chairman Mao's "Talk," loving or not loving the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, is the touchstone for true revolution and false revolution, and the dividing line between Marxism and revisionism. We must resolutely smash the bourgeois and revisionist black line in literature and art represented by Zhou Yang, forever sing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and let Mao Zedong Thought shine forever on the cultural front!

　　毛主席的《讲话》句句是真理
　　北京第一机床厂业余创作组　张连生　刘才　袁国良
    毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》重新发表以后，我们广大职工兴奋异常，读了又读，念了又念。毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，照亮了我们工人的心！毛主席这篇光辉的著作，句句是真理，给了我们极大的智慧和力量。它向我们亿万工农兵发出了战斗的号召，给了我们强大的战斗武器。毛主席的光辉著作，永远是我们文艺工作的最高指示。
    建国以来，许多文学艺术部门被资产阶级的“权威”窃取了领导权，他们到处宣扬封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的思想，企图为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。毛主席早就指出：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”资产阶级的“权威”老爷们利用文艺的形式向党向社会主义猖狂进攻，梦想夺取无产阶级的印把子，完全证明了毛主席关于文艺的阶级性、关于阶级和阶级斗争的学说是无比正确的，是颠扑不破的真理。
    毛主席还指出：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”回顾我厂的文艺活动，我们深深感到，凡是照毛主席的话去做的，凡是符合毛主席指示的，就做对了，就深受广大职工的欢迎，就能使文艺成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的有力武器。凡是违反毛主席指示办事，去搞资产阶级修正主义那一套大、洋、古的玩艺，就必然迷失方向，必然犯错误。
    过去我厂的文化阵地，也受过资产阶级、修正主义文艺黑线的影响，演出过不少鬼戏、坏戏。这些戏，不但没有起积极作用，反而在职工群众中散布了封建主义和资本主义的毒素。一九六四年以来大演革命现代戏，我们受到了很大的教育，全厂职工的思想水平也提高得很快。我们体会到，必须牢记毛主席的教导，让文艺为无产阶级的政治服务，文艺才能发挥战斗的作用。我们工人搞业余文艺活动，只有密切联系广大职工群众，歌颂毛泽东思想、歌颂党、歌颂社会主义、歌颂先进人物，才是唯一正确的方向。明确了方向以后，我们经常配合重大的政治运动进行宣传，利用各种文艺形式在车间演出，得到了广大职工的好评。
    为了配合阶级教育，不久前我们自编自演了雕塑剧《收租院》，不少老工人流着热泪激动地说：“这出戏说出了我们的心里话，我们就是爱看这样的戏。”不少青年说：“这些吃人的地主资本家太坏了，看了这出戏，提高了对阶级斗争的认识，我们一定要听毛主席的话，永远跟党走！”通过这次演出，我们也受到一次深刻的教育，我们表示，一定要永远做文艺战线上的主力军，让革命的戏永远占领我们工厂的文化阵地！
    马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想都是在斗争中发展的。以往我厂职工创作过一些短小精悍的革命的作品，那是党和毛主席文艺路线的胜利，是我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同以周扬为代表的资产阶级、修正主义文艺路线进行斗争的结果。今天，我们重新学习了毛主席的《讲话》，心更明了，眼更亮了，革命斗志更高了。我们进一步认识到：爱不爱毛主席的《讲话》，爱不爱广大工农兵，是真革命和假革命的试金石，是马克思主义和修正主义的分水岭。我们要坚决粉碎以周扬为代表的修正主义文艺黑线，永远歌颂毛泽东思想，保卫毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想在文化阵地上永远光芒万丈！
