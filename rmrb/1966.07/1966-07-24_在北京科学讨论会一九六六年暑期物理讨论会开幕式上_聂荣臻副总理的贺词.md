Chairman, distinguished representatives, friends, and comrades:

The 1966 Summer Physics Discussion of the Beijing Science Conference is now open. This conference is being held in Beijing, and we, as the hosts, feel greatly honored. On behalf of the Chinese government, the Chinese people, and Chinese scientists, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the conference and express my warm welcome to the scientists from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania who are attending.

Today, we have gathered here, representing over a hundred scientists from more than thirty countries across four continents. Among you are renowned physicists, distinguished scientific researchers, and leaders of scientific departments and organizations. Your countries and peoples are engaged in fierce struggles against imperialism and old and new colonialism. You have brought with you the latest achievements in scientific research. These are the results of the hard work of scientists from various countries and also the outcomes of the struggles of peoples against nature and against imperialism and old and new colonialism. Such scientific achievements are the most precious. I take this opportunity to express my highest respect to the scientists from various countries who have dedicated themselves to the development of national and people's scientific causes in the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle.

Modern physics is on the verge of new breakthroughs and leaps. Over the past half-century, especially in the last two to three decades, whether in the microcosm or the macrocosm, many new phenomena and facts have been discovered. A wealth of materials and data have been accumulated through observations and experiments. It can be predicted that as long as we grasp the correct epistemology and methodology, break away from all idealism, metaphysics, agnosticism, and other decadent "theories" of the Western bourgeoisie, and dare to make continuous revolutions, breaking through all kinds of prejudices and old frameworks that shackle our minds, we can make great strides in understanding the objective material world. We will be able to develop new theories to explain and predict the deeper laws of material motion. Chairman Mao Zedong said: "A correct understanding often requires repeated cycles from matter to spirit and from spirit to matter, that is, from practice to cognition and from cognition to practice." Chairman Mao Zedong also pointed out: "In the realms of production struggle and scientific experimentation, humanity is constantly developing, and nature is constantly developing. It will never stop at a certain level. Therefore, humanity must constantly summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress." Modern physics is entering a new era of great revolution. I believe that on this point, the scientists present will have a deeper understanding. Chinese scientists are willing to work together with scientists from the four continents, learning from each other, helping each other, and engaging in creative labor. I sincerely hope and wish that this discussion conference will write a brilliant chapter in the new development of physics.

This physics discussion conference is held in accordance with the initiative of the 1964 Beijing Science Conference and is another important international scientific conference. The 1964 Beijing Science Conference showed that the peoples and scientific workers of the four continents have awakened and are determined to break the control and monopoly of imperialism and old and new colonialism over science, to grasp science in their own hands; to insist on self-reliance, strengthen unity and cooperation, and push our science and culture into a new era of revival and prosperity; to develop our national science and culture to serve the cause of fighting for and defending national independence, safeguarding world peace, and promoting human progress. This conference is held to continue this lofty spirit and undertake this historical mission. We are confident that with the joint efforts of scientists from various countries, this conference will make new contributions to the glorious cause of the 1964 Beijing Science Conference.

All sciences and cultures in the world belong to certain classes and serve the political lines of certain classes. The science and culture of imperialism serve the politics of imperialism. The science and culture of the peoples of the four continents serve the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of the people.

The people and scientists of Western imperialist countries have indeed made outstanding contributions and achieved great successes in the field of science and technology. However, their scientific undertakings are completely controlled by imperialism, and the talents of scientists cannot be fully developed. The results of scientific research are completely used to serve the purposes of exploitation, oppression, enslavement, and massacre of their own people and the people of other countries. The U.S. imperialists shamelessly misuse scientific achievements to manufacture large-scale weapons of mass destruction, brutally suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. In Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is crazily escalating the war of aggression, dropping thousands of tons of bombs and napalm bombs every day, and even inhumanely using poison gas and various chemical poisons to harm and massacre the Vietnamese people. The criminal acts of U.S. imperialism have thoroughly exposed the ugly essence of American scientific civilization, arousing the great indignation and strong opposition of the peoples and scientific workers of the world.

Among the more than two billion people in the four continents, the vast majority have long suffered from the oppression and slavery of imperialism and colonialism. We must develop our scientific undertakings on our own path and absolutely should not follow the old path of the Western imperialist countries. The only correct path for these countries to develop scientific undertakings is to truly grasp science in the hands of their own nations and peoples, truly serving to fight for and defend national independence, develop the national economy, improve people's lives, and serve the cause of safeguarding world peace and promoting human progress. Such scientific undertakings will definitely gain the support and backing of the people and will definitely have a broad and limitless future.

More and more scientists are realizing that in these countries that have long been invaded and oppressed, the issue of scientific development is first and foremost a political issue. Imperialism must be overthrown, and the remnants of imperialism must be eliminated before the people's scientific undertakings can develop. Without true national independence and liberation, it is impossible to have independent development and improvement of national scientific undertakings. For the development of science and social progress, all countries without independence must first engage in national liberation struggles to achieve political independence. Countries that have already achieved independence must also strive to maintain and consolidate national independence, carry the national revolution to the end, thoroughly eliminate all forces and influences of old and new colonialism, and persist in opposing the aggression, interference, control, and subversion of imperialism.

Since liberation, our country's scientific undertakings have achieved tremendous development. In the practice of developing our country's science and technology, we have deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought has pointed the way forward and the path for our people to develop socialist scientific undertakings. Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for us to recognize and transform society, and it is also the sharpest weapon for us to recognize and transform nature. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, emphasizing proletarian politics, letting politics command business, adhering to the general line for socialist construction, adhering to the policy of self-reliance and hard work, making intellectuals combine with the workers and peasants, making scientific experiments combine with production practice, establishing and strengthening a team of scientists who are both red and expert, implementing the combination of leadership, experts, and the masses, implementing the combination of production, scientific research, and education, fully implementing the mass line, continuously promoting the scientific and technological revolution, making it serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and serving the people of the whole country and the people of the whole world. This is the path of development for our country's science and technology. Our country's scientific and technological personnel have already understood from practice that to achieve results in science and technology, one must insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to guide scientific experiments, transform people's worldviews, liberate thoughts, and eliminate superstitions. Those old ideas, habits, and traditions of worshiping the West, worshiping authorities, and worshiping books must not be eliminated, otherwise, they will greatly hinder the development of science and technology. Currently, the great proletarian cultural revolution that is vigorously unfolding in our country is precisely to thoroughly eliminate the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits that poison the people from imperialism and the exploiting classes, and to create and form new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of socialism among the broad masses of the people.

In this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, the broad masses of workers and peasants and revolutionary intellectuals in our country are, under the leadership of the Party, seriously exposing and criticizing a small handful of people who have always been anti-Party and anti-socialist in politics and ideology, who are ignorant and unlearned, and who are so-called "academic authorities" of the bourgeoisie. For the vast majority of patriotic intellectuals and scientists who are politically progressive and diligently serve the people's cause, the Party and the government have always adhered to the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming them. Through this cultural revolution, the broad masses of intellectuals and scientists will be better able to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, transform their worldviews, and raise their socialist consciousness. In this way, they will be able to advance on the path of being both red and expert, dare to make revolutions and be good at making revolutions in scientific and technological work, and contribute fruitful scientific experimental results, better serving the people wholeheartedly.

Establishing and developing the scientific undertakings of our own nations and peoples is the common wish of the peoples and scientists of the four continents. We not only have the determination but also completely have the ability to do this. The countries of the four continents have a long history of culture and science, vast lands, and rich resources. More importantly, they have diligent, brave, and wise peoples. After achieving a thorough victory in the national revolution, the wisdom and talents of the broad masses of the people will be liberated and will display boundless creative power. As long as scientists work together with the people, thoroughly eliminate all reactionary influences of imperialism, make full use of all favorable factors in their own countries, absorb as much as possible the advanced scientific and technological achievements from around the world, and vigorously develop scientific and technological exchanges and mutual assistance and cooperation among the peoples of the four continents, they will definitely be able to revive and prosper the scientific undertakings of their own nations and peoples. The peoples of the four continents are people with aspirations. They are determined to change the backward and poor faces of their own countries. What the West can do, we can also do. What the West cannot do, we will definitely be able to do. It can be fully expected that in the not-too-distant historical period, we will definitely catch up with and surpass the West in the field of science and technology, and leave the West far behind.

Friends and comrades! Our era is the era of the comprehensive collapse of imperialism and the global victory of socialism. The revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary forces of the world, especially the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the imperialist-led United States and its running dogs and accomplices, are engaged in a great struggle.

U.S. imperialism is the most brutal and arrogant aggressor in history. Its ambition is greater than anyone else's. Its hands reach farther than anyone else's. It persists in pursuing a policy of aggression and war worldwide. It not only wants to annihilate socialist countries and annex vast regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America but also implements a policy of "the strong devouring the weak" against its allies in Western Europe, North America, and Oceania. It is an enemy of the people of the world. All peoples and nations that want revolution and liberation, all countries and peoples that want independence and sovereignty, and all countries and peoples that want to safeguard world peace cannot but direct the main thrust of their struggle against U.S. imperialism.

The Johnson administration is escalating the war of aggression in Vietnam and has recently bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the first major port of Vietnam, Haiphong, pushing the war of aggression to a new stage. For the Vietnamese people, the struggle against U.S. imperialism is a life-and-death struggle. Either they defeat U.S. imperialism, or they are annihilated by U.S. imperialism. There is no middle ground. The current Vietnamese issue is an issue of aggression and anti-aggression, and it is not an issue of "peace talks" at all. The aggressive troops of the United States and its vassal states will not withdraw from Vietnam completely, and they will not stop their bloody aggression, so there is no question of peace in Vietnam. On July 17, President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a "Letter to the Nation," expressing the Vietnamese people's resolute will to carry the struggle against the Americans and to save the nation to the end and their unshakable belief in decisive victory. On July 22, Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the People's Republic of China issued a solemn statement to the world, expressing that the Chinese people and the Chinese government most resolutely and enthusiastically support President Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Nation." The statement said that the Chinese government reiterates that U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam is an aggression against China. The 700 million people of China are the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people. The vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people have made up their minds and are well-prepared to take necessary actions with the peoples of China and Vietnam at any time and in any place to jointly strike the U.S. aggressors.

U.S. imperialism dares to push its aggressive and war policies so brazenly around the world because it has received encouragement, support, and cooperation from the Soviet revisionist leadership. The Soviet revisionist leadership is eager to seek U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world, helping U.S. imperialism and its running dogs maintain reactionary rule, and undermining the unity of the world's peoples in the anti-imperialist struggle. It acts as a volunteer fire brigade to extinguish the flames of revolution in the Asia, Africa, and Latin America regions. It actively cooperates with U.S. imperialism in pushing the "peace talks" deception and the counter-revolutionary conspiracy of "bombing to force peace" on the Vietnamese issue. More and more facts show that the Soviet revisionist leadership is the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism and the greatest betrayer of the Vietnamese people, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the peoples of the world. To oppose U.S. imperialism, one must also oppose modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership.

Opposing U.S.-led imperialism and old and new colonialism, fighting for and defending national independence, and safeguarding world peace are the common tasks of struggle for the peoples of the four continents. To achieve our common tasks of struggle, the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania must unite. To the greatest extent possible, isolate and strike U.S. imperialism, the revolutionary peoples of the world must unite, and all forces opposing U.S. imperialism in the world must unite to establish the broadest and most genuine international anti-U.S. united front. This united front should include all countries and peoples suffering from U.S. imperialism's aggression, interference, control, and subversion, but it must not include the running dogs, accomplices, and conspirators of U.S. imperialism, and it must not include the Soviet revisionist leadership.

Friends and comrades! Your coming to Beijing to participate in the physics discussion conference is not only a great help and promotion to the development of our country's scientific undertakings but also brings the deep friendship of the peoples of various countries to our people. For this, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you. The Chinese people have always attached great importance to developing friendship with the peoples of various countries and firmly support the just causes of the peoples of various countries. The Chinese people are very concerned about the holding of this conference and enthusiastically support your lofty work. The Chinese people will forever stand with you and with the peoples of the four continents to strive together for new victories in our common cause.

I wish the Beijing Physics Discussion Conference a great success!

I wish all friends and comrades good health and smooth work!

    在北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会开幕式上
    聂荣臻副总理的贺词
    新华社二十三日讯　聂荣臻副总理在北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会开幕式上的贺词，全文如下：主席、各位代表，朋友们、同志们：
    北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会，今天开幕了。这次会议在北京召开，我们作为东道主，感到十分荣幸。我代表中国政府、中国人民和中国科学家，向会议表示衷心的祝贺，向出席会议的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲的各国科学家表示热烈的欢迎。
    今天，在这里济济一堂，有来自四大洲三十多个国家的一百多位代表。你们中间有的是国际上著名的物理学家，有的是卓有成就的科学研究工作者，有的是科学部门和团体的领导人。你们的国家和人民，正在同帝国主义和新老殖民主义进行着火热的斗争。你们给这次会议带来了科学研究的新成果。这是各国科学家辛勤劳动的结果，同时也是各国人民同自然界作斗争，同帝国主义、新老殖民主义作斗争的结果。这样的科学研究成果是最可贵的。我愿借此机会，向在反帝革命斗争中为发展民族的、人民大众的科学事业而献身的各国科学家，致以崇高的敬意。
    现代物理学正在酝酿着新的突破和跃进。半个世纪以来，特别是最近二、三十年以来，无论在微观世界或是宏观世界，都发现了许多新的现象和事实，在观测和实验中又积累了大量的材料和数据。可以预言，只要我们掌握正确的认识论和方法论，破除一切唯心主义、形而上学、不可知论等西方资产阶级的腐朽“理论”，只要我们敢于不断革命，突破束缚我们头脑的各种成见和老框框，我们就可以在认识客观物质世界的道路上大大前进一步，就有可能发展新的理论，来阐明和预见有关物质运动的更深刻的规律。毛泽东主席说：“一个正确的认识，往往需要经过由物质到精神，由精神到物质，即由实践到认识，由认识到实践这样多次的反复，才能够完成。”毛泽东主席还指出：“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”现代物理学正在进入一个大革命的新时期。我相信，在这一点上，在座的各位科学家一定会有更深刻的体会。中国的科学家愿意同四大洲的科学家在一起，互相学习，互相帮助，共同进行创造性的劳动。我衷心地希望并且预祝这次讨论会，将为物理学的新发展写下光辉的篇章。
    这次物理讨论会，是根据一九六四年北京科学讨论会的倡议而举行的，是又一次具有重要意义的国际科学会议。一九六四年北京科学讨论会表明：我们四大洲的人民和科学工作者已经觉醒起来，决心打破帝国主义和新老殖民主义对科学的控制和垄断，把科学掌握在自己手里；决心坚持自力更生，加强团结合作，把我们的科学文化推进到一个复兴和繁荣的新时期；决心发展我们各国的科学文化，为争取和维护民族独立、保卫世界和平和促进人类进步的事业服务。这次会议，是为了继续贯彻这个崇高精神，负起这个历史使命。我们深信，在各国科学家的共同努力下，这次会议必将对一九六四年北京科学讨论会的光辉事业作出新的贡献。
    世界上的一切科学文化都是属于一定的阶级，为一定阶级的政治路线服务的。帝国主义的科学文化，为帝国主义政治服务。我们四大洲人民的科学文化，为人民反帝革命事业服务。
    西方帝国主义国家的人民和科学家，的确在科学技术方面作出了卓越的贡献，取得了很大的成就。但是，那里的科学事业完全被帝国主义所控制，科学家的才能得不到充分的发挥，科学研究成果完全被用来为剥削、压迫、奴役和屠杀本国人民和别国人民的目的服务。美帝国主义肆无忌惮地滥用科学成果，制造大规模杀人武器，血腥镇压亚非拉和世界各国人民的革命斗争。在越南，美帝国主义正在疯狂地推进侵略战争，每天投下成千上万吨的炸弹和凝固汽油弹，甚至灭绝人性地使用毒气和各种化学毒剂，残害和屠杀越南人民。美帝国主义的这种罪恶行为，彻底暴露了美国科学文明的丑恶本质，激起了世界各国人民和科学工作者的极大愤慨和强烈反对。
    在我们四大洲二十几亿人口中，绝大多数都是长期遭受帝国主义、殖民主义统治和奴役的被压迫民族。我们发展科学事业必须走自己的道路，绝对不应该走西方帝国主义国家走过的老路。我们这些国家发展科学事业的唯一正确道路，就是要把科学真正掌握在本民族和本国人民手里，真正为争取和维护民族独立、发展民族经济、改善人民生活服务，为保卫世界和平和促进人类进步的事业服务。这样的科学事业，一定能够得到人民的拥护和支持，一定会有无限广阔的发展前途。
    越来越多的科学家认识到：在我们这些长期被侵略、被压迫的国家里，科学的发展问题，首先是政治问题。帝国主义不打倒，帝国主义的遗毒不清除，人民的科学事业就不能发展。没有真正的民族独立和解放，就不可能有民族科学事业的独立发展和提高。为了科学的发展和社会的进步，一切没有独立的国家，首先需要进行民族解放斗争，取得政治上的独立。已经独立的国家，还需要努力维护和巩固民族独立，把民族革命进行到底，彻底肃清新老殖民主义的一切势力和影响，坚持反对帝国主义的侵略、干涉、控制和颠覆。
    我国的科学事业在解放以来取得了巨大的发展。在发展我国科学技术的实践中，我们深刻地体会到：毛泽东思想为我国人民发展社会主义的科学事业指引了前进的方向和道路。毛泽东思想是我们认识和改造社会的最锐利的武器，同样，也是我们认识和改造自然的最锐利的武器。高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，以毛泽东思想为指针，突出无产阶级政治，以政治统帅业务，坚持社会主义建设总路线，坚持奋发图强、自力更生的方针，使知识分子同工农群众相结合，使科学实验同生产实践相结合，建立和壮大又红又专的科学技术队伍，实行领导、专家、群众的三结合，实行生产、科学研究、教育的三结合，大力贯彻群众路线，不断推进科学技术革命，使之为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，为全中国人民和全世界人民服务。这就是我国科学技术的发展道路。我国科学技术人员从实践中已经懂得，要在科学技术方面取得成果，就必须坚持用毛泽东思想指导科学实验，改造人的世界观，解放思想，破除迷信。那种迷信西方、迷信权威、迷信本本的旧思想、旧习惯、旧传统不破除，就会极大地妨碍科学技术的发展。目前，我国轰轰烈烈展开的社会主义文化大革命，正是为了彻底破除帝国主义和剥削阶级毒害人民的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，在广大人民群众中创造和形成社会主义的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯。
    在这场史无前例的社会主义文化大革命中，我国广大的工农群众和革命知识分子，正在党的领导下，对一小撮在政治上、思想上一贯地反党反社会主义的不学无术的资产阶级所谓“学术权威”，进行严肃的揭露和批判。对于绝大多数爱国的、政治上要求进步的、勤勤恳恳为人民事业服务的知识分子和科学家，党和政府一贯采取团结、教育、改造的方针。通过这场文化大革命，广大知识分子和科学家，将会更好地用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，改造自己的世界观，提高社会主义觉悟。这样，他们就能够在又红又专的道路上前进，在科学技术工作中敢于革命、善于革命，贡献出丰硕的科学实验成果，更好地全心全意地为人民服务。
    建立和发展本民族的和本国人民的科学事业，是我们四大洲人民和科学家的共同愿望。我们不仅有决心，而且完全有能力做到这一点。我们四大洲的国家，有着悠久的文化和科学传统，有着辽阔的土地和丰富的资源，更重要的是有着勤劳、勇敢、智慧的人民。在取得民族革命的彻底胜利之后，广大人民群众的智慧和才能就会解放出来，发挥出无穷无尽的创造力量。各国科学家只要同人民一道，彻底破除帝国主义的一切反动影响，充分利用本国的一切有利因素，尽量吸取世界上一切先进的科学技术成果，并且大力发展我们四大洲各国人民之间的科学技术交流和互助合作，就一定能够把本民族和本国人民的科学事业复兴和繁荣起来。我们四大洲各国人民，是有志气的人民，决心改变自己国家一穷二白的面貌。西方可以做到的，我们也能够做到，西方所做不到的，我们也一定能够做到。完全可以预期，在不太长的历史时期内，我们在科学技术方面，就一定能够后来居上，赶上和超过西方，并且把西方远远地抛在我们的后面。
    朋友们、同志们！我们的时代，是帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。全世界革命势力和反革命势力之间，特别是亚非拉人民同以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶之间，正在进行着一场大搏斗。
    美帝国主义是历史上最残暴、最狂妄的侵略者。它的野心比谁都大。它的手伸得比谁都长。它在全世界坚持推行侵略政策和战争政策。它不仅要消灭社会主义国家，囊括亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的广大地区，而且对它在西欧、北美和大洋洲的盟国，也实行“弱肉强食”的政策。它同全世界人民为敌。全世界一切要革命、要解放的人民和民族，一切要争取独立、维护主权的国家和人民，一切要保卫世界和平的国家和人民，都不能不把斗争的主要锋芒指向美帝国主义。
    约翰逊政府变本加厉地在越南扩大侵略战争，最近又轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内和越南第一大港海防，把侵略战争推进到一个新的阶段。对越南人民说来，同美帝国主义的斗争，是一场你死我活的斗争。要末就是战胜美帝国主义，要末就是被美帝国主义灭亡。中间的道路是没有的。当前的越南问题，是一个侵略与反侵略的问题，根本不是什么“和谈”的问题。美国及其附庸国的侵略军队不从越南全部撤走，不停止血腥的侵略，就根本谈不上什么越南的和平。七月十七日，越南民主共和国主席胡志明发表《告全国同胞书》，表达了越南人民决心把抗美救国斗争进行到底的坚强意志，表达了越南人民决战决胜的不可动摇的信念。七月二十二日，中华人民共和国主席刘少奇向全世界发表庄严声明，中国人民和中国政府最坚决地、最热烈地支持胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》。声明中说，中国政府重申，美帝国主义对越南的侵略，就是对中国的侵略。中国七亿人民是越南人民的坚强后盾。中国辽阔的国土，是越南人民的可靠后方。中国人民下定了决心，做好了各种准备，随时随地采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动，共同打击美国侵略者。
    美帝国主义敢于如此放肆地在全世界推行侵略政策和战争政策，是由于它得到了苏联修正主义领导集团的鼓励、支持和配合。苏联修正主义领导集团一心谋求美苏合作主宰世界，帮助美帝国主义及其走狗维持反动统治，瓦解世界人民团结反帝的队伍。它在亚非拉地区，为美帝国主义扑灭革命斗争的烈火充当义务消防队。它在越南问题上，积极配合美帝国主义推行“和谈”欺骗、“以炸迫和”的反革命阴谋。越来越多的事实表明，苏联修正主义领导集团是美帝国主义的头号帮凶，是越南人民、亚非拉人民和全世界人民的最大背叛者。要反对美帝国主义，必须同时反对以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义。
    反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立，保卫世界和平，是我们四大洲各国人民共同的斗争任务。为了实现我们共同的斗争任务，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲各国人民要团结起来。为了最大限度地孤立和打击美帝国主义，全世界革命人民要团结起来，全世界一切反对美帝国主义的力量要团结起来，建立一个最广泛、最真实的国际反美统一战线。这个统一战线，应当包括一切受到美帝国主义侵略、干涉、控制和颠覆的国家和人民，但是绝不能包括美帝国主义的走狗、帮凶和同谋者，绝不能包括苏联修正主义领导集团。
    朋友们、同志们！你们这次来北京参加物理讨论会，不仅对我国科学事业的发展是一个很大的帮助和推动，而且给我国人民带来了各国人民的深情厚谊。对此，我要向你们表示衷心的感谢。中国人民一向重视发展同各国人民的友谊，坚决支持各国人民的正义事业。中国人民非常关注这次会议的举行，热烈支持你们的崇高工作。中国人民将永远同你们一起，同四大洲各国人民一起，为争取我们共同事业的新胜利并肩前进。
    祝北京物理讨论会成功！
    祝各国朋友们、同志们身体健康，工作顺利！
