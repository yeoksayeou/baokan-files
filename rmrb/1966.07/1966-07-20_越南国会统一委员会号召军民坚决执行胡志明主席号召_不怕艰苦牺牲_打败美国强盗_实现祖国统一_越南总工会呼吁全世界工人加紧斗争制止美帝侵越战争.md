The Vietnamese National Assembly Standing Committee has called on the military and civilians to resolutely carry out Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to bravely advance, fear no hardships or sacrifices, and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors to achieve national unification.

	The committee's statement said: Recently, the U.S. imperialists have dared to bomb and strafe the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. "This is a very dangerous new 'escalation' of the war by U.S. imperialism. It once again exposes the warlike and bloodthirsty nature of U.S. imperialism, and at the same time, it exposes the deceitfulness of the 'unconditional negotiations' advocated by the Johnson clique."

	The statement pointed out, "Obviously, U.S. imperialism has trampled on all the provisions of the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Vietnamese question, blatantly violated international law, and provoked socialist countries and peace-loving people around the world."

	The statement said, under the glorious banner of the National Liberation Front, the people of South Vietnam are fighting more vigorously and have achieved brilliant victories. After bravely smashing the U.S. aggressors' "dry season offensive," the southern military and civilians are now launching victorious attacks against the enemy on all fronts. In the North, our people and soldiers, with the determination to defeat the American aggressors, have achieved many great successes in production and combat.

	The statement said, "Our entire nation of 31 million people is more united than ever, resolutely fighting against the U.S. aggressors and their puppet regime, and are ready at any time to smash their every adventurous act."

	The statement said, "Obviously, our situation is one of victory. In the future, even if U.S. imperialism sends tens of thousands more troops and further intensifies its war of aggression in South Vietnam and its war of destruction in the North, our military and civilians will definitely defeat it and drive it out of our country."

	The statement said, the Vietnamese National Assembly Standing Committee fully supports Chairman Ho's call and the important decisions made by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly and the Central Military Commission. It calls on the entire army and people to resolutely carry out the partial mobilization order issued by Chairman Ho, to constantly heighten vigilance, deepen hatred towards the enemy, and continue to promote production and combat, smashing all the U.S. aggressors' war 'escalation' actions.

	According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese General Federation of Labor has called on workers worldwide to intensify their struggle against the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam and stop this criminal war by U.S. imperialism.

	In a telegram to workers of various countries, the Vietnamese General Federation of Labor condemned the heinous crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam. The telegram pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' intensified and expanded war activities, as well as their "peace" deception, will not save U.S. imperialism from its doom and will not enable them to escape the strong condemnation of world public opinion.

	The telegram pointed out that the only way out for U.S. imperialism is for the U.S. government to formally accept the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, which clearly state the correct position of the Vietnamese people, and to implement it in practice. This includes stopping the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam; withdrawing all U.S. troops and war materials from South Vietnam and allowing the South Vietnamese people to settle their internal affairs themselves.

	The telegram expressed heartfelt thanks to the workers and peace-loving and justice-seeking people of various countries for their sympathy and great support for the Vietnamese people. The telegram said that these precious spiritual and material assistance and support have greatly encouraged the struggle of the Vietnamese people and have played a huge role in their victory.

	The telegram called on workers of various countries to further advance the movement to oppose U.S. aggression in Vietnam, including holding meetings, demonstrations, and strikes; conducting large-scale propaganda in various ways to condemn the U.S. imperialists' evil plots and barbaric crimes in Vietnam, and exposing the deceptive "peace" talks of Johnson, McNamara, and Rusk; boycotting the production, loading, and transportation of U.S. weapons and war materials sent to South Vietnam; and widely introducing the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people and the just position of the Vietnamese people on the solution to the Vietnamese question.

	On July 17, soldiers of the Hanoi People's Armed Public Security Forces wrote a letter to Chairman Ho, expressing their determination to carry the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to a thorough victory.

　　越南国会统一委员会号召军民坚决执行胡志明主席号召
　　不怕艰苦牺牲　打败美国强盗　实现祖国统一

    新华社河内十九日电　越南民主共和国国会统一委员会十八日发表声明，号召越南全国军民，坚决响应胡主席的号召，英勇前进，不怕一切艰苦牺牲，彻底打败美国侵略强盗，实现祖国的统一。
    声明说：最近美帝国主义竟然冒险轰炸和扫射河内和海防市区，“这是美帝国主义极其危险的新的战争‘升级’。它再一次暴露了美帝国主义的好战和嗜血成性的本质，同时也暴露了约翰逊集团一直叫嚷的‘无条件谈判’的论调的欺骗性。”
    声明指出，“显然，美帝国主义已经践踏了一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议的各项条款，明目张胆地违反了国际法，对社会主义国家和世界爱好和平人民进行了挑衅。”
    声明说，越南南方同胞在民族解放阵线的光荣旗帜下，越战越强，取得了辉煌的胜利。南方军民在英勇粉碎了美国侵略者的“旱季攻势”以后，已经并且正在所有战线上胜利地进攻敌人。在北方，我国人民和战士本着决心战胜美国强盗的精神，在生产和战斗中取得了许多巨大的成绩。
    声明说，“我们全国三千一百万人民比任何时候都要团结一致，坚决进行抗击美国侵略军和走狗集团的斗争，并随时准备粉碎它们的一切冒险行动。”
    声明说：“显然，我们的形势是胜利者的形势。今后，即使美帝国主义再增派几十万军队，进一步加强侵略越南南方的战争和对北方的破坏性战争，我国军民也一定要战胜它，并且把它赶出我国国土。”
    声明说，越南民主共和国国会统一委员会完全拥护胡主席的号召和国会常务委员会以及最高国防会议作出的重要决定，并且号召全军全民坚决执行胡主席颁布的局部动员令，不断提高警惕，时刻加深对敌人的仇恨，再接再厉，促进生产和战斗，粉碎美国强盗的一切战争“升级”行动。
    新华社河内十九日电据越南通讯社报道，越南总工会呼吁全世界工人加紧反对美国侵越战争的斗争，制止美帝国主义的这场罪恶战争。
    越南总工会在给各国工人的电报中谴责了美国侵略者在越南犯下的滔天罪行。电报指出，美帝国主义加紧和扩大战争的活动以及他们的“和平”骗局，都挽救不了美帝国主义的灭亡，也无法使他们逃脱世界舆论的强烈谴责。
    电报指出，美帝国主义的出路只有一条，那就是：美国政府必须正式接受越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明所清楚阐明的越南人民的正确立场，并以实际行动加以执行，包括停止美国的侵越战争；从越南南方撤出全部美军和战争物资，让越南南方人民自己来解决他们的内部事务。
    电报对世界各国工人以及爱好和平和伸张正义的人民所给予越南人民的同情和巨大支持表示最热烈的感谢。电报说，这些宝贵的精神和物质的援助和支持，大大地鼓舞了越南人民的斗争，对他们的胜利起了巨大的作用。
    电报要求各国工人进一步推进反对美国侵略越南的斗争运动，包括：举行会议，示威，举行罢工；用各种方式开展大规模宣传工作，谴责美帝国主义者在越南所干的罪恶阴谋和野蛮罪行，揭露约翰逊、麦克纳马拉和腊斯克的骗人的“和平”言谈；抵制生产、装卸和运输美国送往南越的武器和战争物资；广泛地介绍越南人民所取得的巨大胜利和越南人民关于解决越南问题的办法的正义立场。（附图片）
