Observer Nariyuki Narita of the Permanent Secretariat of the Conference of Asian and African Legal Workers said at the plenary session of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers today that imperialism will not leave unless it is driven out and will not fall unless it is overthrown. The nature of imperialism will never change.

He said that the desperate struggles of imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, although they may create a temporary uproar, will never change the historical direction of the Asian and African peoples to oppose imperialism, to make revolution, and to achieve thorough liberation. As long as the Asian and African peoples remain vigilant, strengthen their unity, and persist in their struggle, they will definitely be able to drive imperialism and old and new colonialism out of Asia and Africa.

Nariyuki Narita said that at present, the peoples of the world, especially the Asian and African peoples, are engaged in a fierce struggle against imperialism led by the United States. The struggle of the Asian and African peoples against American imperialism is developing more deeply and widely, and a new, greater, and more intense anti-imperialist revolutionary storm is about to rise.

He said that the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression for national salvation is the current focus of the world's anti-American struggle. The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression for national salvation has set a brilliant example for the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations.

He condemned American imperialism for escalating the aggression war on one hand and playing the "peace talks" trick on the other. He also condemned those pseudo-revolutionaries who, under the banner of "aiding Vietnam and opposing America," are working hard to serve the U.S. "peace talks" plot. He said that the great Vietnamese people are neither intimidated nor deceived. The various struggles of American imperialism and its accomplices on the Vietnamese issue will only hasten their doom.

    亚非法律工作者会议观察员成田的发言
    新华社四日讯　亚非法律工作者会议常设书记处观察员成田良雄今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，帝国主义是不赶不走，不打不倒的。帝国主义的本性是永远不会改变的。
    他说，帝国主义和各国反动派的垂死挣扎，尽管可以喧嚣一时，但决不能改变亚非人民要反帝，要革命，要彻底解放的历史发展方向。亚非人民只要提高警惕，加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够把帝国主义和新老殖民主义从亚非统统赶出去。
    成田良雄说，目前，全世界人民，特别是亚非人民正在同以美国为首的帝国主义进行激烈的搏斗。亚非人民反对美帝国主义的斗争正在更加深入、更加广泛的发展，一个新的、更大的、更激烈的反帝革命风暴即将兴起。
    他说，越南人民的抗美救国斗争是当前世界人民反美斗争的焦点。英雄的越南人民抗美救国斗争的胜利，为一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的反帝革命斗争树立了一个光辉的榜样。
    他谴责美帝国主义一面加紧侵略战争的升级，一面又大肆玩弄“和谈”骗局。他还谴责那些打着“援越反美”旗号的假革命者竭力为美国“和谈”阴谋效劳。他说，伟大的越南人民是吓不倒，也骗不了的。美帝国主义及其帮凶在越南问题上的种种挣扎，只会加速它们末日的到来。
