Members of the militia self-defense team at the machine factory in Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, are intensifying their military training to shoot down more American aggressor planes.

On the evening of July 17, 1966, the military and civilians of Hanoi held an armed parade. The parade, carrying banners that read "The capital's military and civilians respond to Chairman Hu's call, unite as one, fear no hardships or sacrifices, and resolutely defeat the American invading aggressors," marched forward.

The Liberation Army of South Vietnam, active in the water network area of the central region, strikes against the U.S.-puppet forces.

On July 6, tens of thousands of military and civilians in Hanoi held a grand demonstration to strongly condemn the heinous crimes of the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong. The image shows a large group of captured American pilots being paraded through the streets of Hanoi by the Vietnamese People's Army.
