Major General Ho Van Lau, head of the Vietnamese People's Army General Staff Liaison Mission, sent an urgent telegram to the chairman of the International Control Commission in Vietnam on July 7, strongly protesting the repeated aerial bombardment and strafing of residential areas and economic facilities in Haiphong, the second-largest city in North Vietnam, by multiple batches of U.S. aggressor aircraft on July 7. The aircraft also fired rockets at ships docked in Haiphong Port.

U.S. aircraft also bombed the capital of the North Vietnam Autonomous Region, Thanh Hoa City, and the provincial capital of Thua Thien Province, Thua Thien City, on July 7.

The telegram pointed out that this is the second time in less than ten days that U.S. air pirates have bombed Haiphong City since their savage bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong on June 29, committing another unforgivable crime against the Vietnamese people.

The telegram pointed out that these heinous war crimes by U.S. imperialism fully expose the warlike and brutal nature of U.S. aggression and once again expose the fraudulent "peace" charade of Johnson.

    何文楼大校抗议美机再次轰炸海防
    据新华社河内七日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校七日打紧急电报给越南国际委员会主席，强烈抗议美国强盗飞机多批，七日再次滥肆轰炸和扫射越南北方第二大城市海防市内的居民区和经济设施，并且对停泊在海防港内的船只发射火箭。
    美国飞机七日还再次轰炸越北自治区首府太原市和太平省省会太平市。
    电报指出，这是美国空中强盗继六月二十九日野蛮轰炸河内和海防以后，在不到十天内第二次轰炸海防市，再次对越南人民犯下了不可饶恕的罪行。
    电报指出，美帝国主义的这些罪大恶极的战争行动，彻底暴露了美国当局的好战和残暴的侵略本质，并且再一次揭穿了约翰逊玩弄的假和平的骗局。
