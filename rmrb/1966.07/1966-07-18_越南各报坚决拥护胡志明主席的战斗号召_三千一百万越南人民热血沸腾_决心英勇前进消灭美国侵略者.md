Determined to bravely advance and annihilate the American aggressors

Hanoi, July 17 (Xinhua) - Vietnamese newspapers published editorials on July 17, enthusiastically responding to and resolutely supporting Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great battle call.

The editorial of the "People's Daily" said that the sacred cause of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation is a heroic epic that resounds through the ages. In this magnificent heroic epic, every call of Chairman Ho, the beloved leader of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Vietnamese nation, is a resounding bugle call that ignites the patriotic fervor, hatred for the enemy, and revolutionary spirit of the Vietnamese people, driving them to bravely attack and defeat the enemy.

The editorial said that at present, the people of the whole country are listening to Chairman Ho's call: "Comrades and soldiers throughout the country, advance bravely!" This is the call of the Vietnamese motherland. It embodies the iron will of the 31 million Vietnamese people to defeat the American aggressors and struggle for national freedom and independence. The patriotic blood of the 31 million Vietnamese people is boiling, determined to charge forward and annihilate the enemy, and will not disappoint this sublime call.

The editorial said that the will of the entire Vietnamese nation and people is to defeat the American aggressors! Fight, fight fiercely, fight until the final victory!

The editorial said that the situation in Vietnam is excellent, and our strength is growing. The Vietnamese people not only have absolute superiority in political and spiritual aspects but also have the strategic and tactical advantages of a people's war that is invincible. We have an ironclad people's armed force. The Vietnamese people are just, and we will definitely win!

The editorial of the "Hanoi Capital Daily" said that the military and people of Hanoi, together with the military and people of the whole country, not only do not fear the American bandits but will also definitely defeat them. The military and people of Hanoi are already ready. No matter how much the American bandits escalate the war, no matter how great the sacrifices and hardships they endure, the military and people of Hanoi's iron will and determination to defeat the American aggressors and drive them out of South Vietnam are unshakable.

The editorial of the "New Era Daily" said that the Vietnamese people say what they mean and do what they say. The Vietnamese people are irreconcilable with the American bandits and are determined to fight until there is not a single American bandit left on the sacred soil of Vietnam.
