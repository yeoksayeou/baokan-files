Soldier Liu Yingjun of the artillery company of a certain unit in the Shenyang Military Region sacrificed his life to protect the safety of the people. He is another hero like Ouyang Hai in our army, and a great communist warrior of our times like Lei Feng and Wang Jie.

Liu Yingjun is the son of a poor peasant. Like countless young people from worker and poor peasant families in our country, he loves our great Party and our great leader Chairman Mao deeply. After enlisting, he enthusiastically responded to the call of the Central Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao to study Chairman Mao's works actively and apply them in practice. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and through revolutionary struggles, he grew rapidly. Liu Yingjun's heroic sacrifice once again proves that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the highest moral qualities and can withstand the most severe tests.

Liu Yingjun truly regarded Chairman Mao's books as supreme instructions. He studied the supreme instructions diligently, executed them faithfully, propagated them enthusiastically, and defended them bravely. This is the most worthy aspect of Liu Yingjun for us to learn from.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Never forget class struggle. Liu Yingjun firmly remembered this teaching. He said, "Studying Chairman Mao's works 'helped me understand who our enemies are and who our friends are, this primary question of the revolution. It also helped me understand class struggle, proletarian revolution, proletarian dictatorship, and communism.' He paid great attention to major class struggles both domestically and internationally. He remained highly vigilant and alert against imperialist armed aggression and the "peaceful evolution" plots of domestic and foreign class enemies. He stood firmly on principle, clearly distinguishing between love and hate, filled with class brotherhood towards comrades and the people, and harbored deep hatred towards the enemy.

Class and class struggle, proletarian revolution, and proletarian dictatorship are the core of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Practice has proven that without the perspective of class struggle, one cannot see the political situation clearly, cannot correctly understand and execute the Party's policies, cannot distinguish between enemies and friends or right and wrong, and cannot wholeheartedly serve the people. Without the perspective of class struggle, one will lose political direction, become confused, develop rightist thoughts, and make serious mistakes. Liu Yingjun became a good soldier of Chairman Mao primarily because he armed himself with Chairman Mao's thoughts on class and class struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must use the weapon of self-criticism and the method of strengthening study to reform ourselves, making ourselves suitable for the needs of the Party and the revolution." Liu Yingjun firmly executed this instruction. He studied Chairman Mao's works, focusing on reforming his worldview. He repeatedly studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "Opposing Liberalism," often using them to examine and check himself, waging a struggle within his own thoughts to promote proletarian ideals and eliminate bourgeois ones. His diary is filled with self-criticism, recording his conscious revolution and self-reform guided by Mao Zedong Thought. He learned and then practiced, daring to take action. He devoted almost all his spare time to doing many good deeds for the company and the people. He never left his name when doing good deeds, never told his leaders and comrades, and never wrote about them in his diary. In his diary, there is a sentence: "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai, and to live for the people's interests is also heavier than Mount Tai." He combined his grand ideal of struggling for communism with doing practical, bit-by-bit good deeds for the people. In his concrete practice of serving the people, he continuously raised his class consciousness, gradually establishing a proletarian worldview of "living for the revolution, dying for the revolution," "revolution means struggle, struggle means happiness," being both a domestic and an international revolutionary.

Studying Chairman Mao's works must solve the fundamental problem of worldview. To become a true Communist Party member and a true proletarian revolutionary warrior, one must, like Liu Yingjun, definitely use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, use the weapon of self-criticism, consciously wage a struggle to promote proletarian ideals and eliminate bourgeois ones. One must definitely participate in revolutionary practice, tempering and reforming oneself in hard work and the great storms of class struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Politics is the commander, the soul; political work is the lifeline of our army. Liu Yingjun firmly executed this instruction. He paid great attention to the company's political and ideological construction, often proposing suggestions to the leadership, and voluntarily doing a lot of political and ideological work. In 1964, when some people were influenced by the pure military viewpoint and developed a tendency to neglect politics, he unshakably put studying Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all work, insisting on the direction of the "Four Firsts." In carrying out company cultural activities, he consciously implemented Chairman Mao's directive that literature and art should serve proletarian politics. He was a vanguard on the company's ideological and cultural front.

A comrade, regardless of the position he holds, as long as he can, like Liu Yingjun, truly regard Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instructions for all work, as the highest standard for distinguishing right from wrong, he can stand high and see far, always highlighting proletarian politics, and never losing direction in any situation.

Liu Yingjun not only seriously studied and implemented Mao Zedong Thought but also actively propagated it. He propagated Mao Zedong Thought within the company and among the people. The more he experienced, the more he realized that the revolution could not do without Mao Zedong Thought, the more urgently he hoped that more people would master Mao Zedong Thought. He regarded spreading Mao Zedong Thought as his lifelong career.

Domestic and foreign class enemies are most afraid of Mao Zedong Thought. They use every means to attack and slander it. The spread of Mao Zedong Thought inevitably encounters their stubborn resistance and opposition. Every step forward in the Mao Zedong Thought front must go through fierce struggles. Liu Yingjun maintained the vigilance of a proletarian revolutionary warrior against those fallacies that oppose the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. Once exposed, he actively fought and resolutely counterattacked. He was a brave defender of Mao Zedong Thought.

Liu Yingjun was such a person who loved and believed in Mao Zedong Thought limitlessly, who firmly implemented and defended Mao Zedong Thought.

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is being carried out vigorously. This is a very sharp and complex class struggle, a life-and-death struggle between the restoration of capitalism and the prevention of its restoration by the proletariat, a long and fierce struggle in the ideological realm between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over who will prevail. Every cadre and soldier must actively participate in this struggle, thoroughly smash the capitalist offensive, resolutely defend the socialist system, defend proletarian dictatorship, and defend Mao Zedong Thought. We must, like Liu Yingjun, forever be loyal to the Party, to the people, to Chairman Mao, and to Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Lin Biao calls on us to continue emphasizing politics, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and focus on the "application" aspect, regarding Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instructions for all military work. Learning from Liu Yingjun has great significance for implementing this instruction. The implementation of emphasizing politics is to strengthen Mao Zedong Thought education, grasp living thoughts, and cultivate tens of thousands of good soldiers of Chairman Mao like Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Liu Yingjun.

　　学习最高指示　执行最高指示  宣传最高指示　捍卫最高指示
　　——向毛主席的好战士刘英俊同志学习
    沈阳部队某部炮连战士刘英俊同志，为了保卫人民群众的生命安全，英勇牺牲了。这是我军又一个欧阳海式的英雄人物，是我们时代又一个雷锋、王杰式的伟大的共产主义战士。
    刘英俊同志是贫农的儿子。他象我国千千万万个出身于工人阶级和贫下中农家庭的青年一样，无比地热爱我们伟大的党，热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席。他入伍以后，热烈响应中央军委和林彪同志的号召，活学活用毛主席著作，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在革命斗争的锻炼中迅速成长起来。刘英俊同志的英勇献身，又一次证明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，有最高尚的思想品质，经得起最严峻的考验。
    刘英俊同志真正做到了把毛主席的书当作最高指示。他努力地学习最高指示，忠实地执行最高指示，热情地宣传最高指示，勇敢地捍卫最高指示。这是刘英俊同志最值得我们学习的地方。
    毛主席教导我们：千万不要忘记阶级斗争。刘英俊同志牢牢记住这一教导。他说，学习毛主席著作，“使我了解了谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友这个革命的首要问题。又使我了解了阶级斗争，无产阶级革命，无产阶级专政，共产主义”。他十分关心国内外阶级斗争的大事。他对帝国主义的武装侵略，对国内外阶级敌人“和平演变”的阴谋，都保持着高度的警惕和戒备。他立场坚定，爱憎分明，对同志、对人民充满着阶级兄弟的感情，对敌人怀着刻骨的仇恨。
    阶级和阶级斗争，无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的核心。实践证明，没有阶级斗争的观点，就不能看清政治形势，就不能正确地理解和执行党的政策，就不能分清敌我、辨明是非，就不能全心全意为人民服务。没有阶级斗争的观点，就会迷失政治方向，当糊涂人，就会产生右倾思想，犯大错误。刘英俊同志所以成为毛主席的好战士，首先是因为用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的思想武装了自己。
    毛主席教导我们：“要用自我批评的武器和加强学习的方法，来改造自己，使适合于党与革命的需要。”刘英俊同志坚决执行这一指示。他学习毛主席著作，紧紧抓住了世界观的改造。他反反复复学习“老三篇”和《反对自由主义》，经常用来对照和检查自己，在自己思想上开展兴无灭资的斗争。他的日记充满着自我批评，是一部以毛泽东思想为指针进行自觉革命、自我改造的记录。他学了就用，勇于实践。他拿出几乎全部的业余时间，为连队、为人民群众做了大量好事。他做好事，从来不留姓名，不向领导和同志们说，也不写在日记里。在他的日记中有这样一句话：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重，为人民利益而活着的人，也比那泰山还重。”他把为共产主义事业奋斗的远大理想，同踏踏实实、一点一滴地做有益于人民的事情结合了起来。他在为人民服务的具体实践中，不断地提高自己的阶级觉悟，逐步树立了“生为革命生，死为革命死”，“革命就要斗争，斗争就是幸福”，既做国内革命派，又做国际革命派的无产阶级世界观。
    学习毛主席著作，必须解决世界观这个根本问题。我们要做一个真正的共产党员、真正的无产阶级革命战士，就应当象刘英俊同志那样，一定要以毛泽东思想为指针，运用自我批评的武器，自觉地进行兴无灭资的斗争。一定要参加革命的实践，在艰苦的工作和阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼和改造自己。
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是我军的生命线。刘英俊同志坚决执行这一指示。他十分关心连队的政治思想建设，经常向领导提出建议，自动地做了许多政治思想工作。一九六四年，当一些人受到单纯军事观点影响，产生忽视政治的倾向时，他毫不动摇地把学习毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位，坚持了四个第一的方向。他在开展连队文化活动中，自觉地贯彻执行了毛主席关于文艺为无产阶级政治服务的方针。他是连队思想文化战线上的一个尖兵。
    一个同志，不管他担任什么职务，只要他能够象刘英俊同志那样，真正把毛主席的书当作一切工作的最高指示，当作辨别一切是非的最高标准，他就能站得高，看得远，在任何情况下都突出无产阶级政治，在任何时候都不迷失方向。
    刘英俊同志不仅认真学习和贯彻毛泽东思想，而且积极宣传毛泽东思想。他在连队宣传毛泽东思想，在人民群众中宣传毛泽东思想。他从自己的体验中越是认识到革命离不开毛泽东思想，就越是迫切地希望更多的人掌握毛泽东思想。他把传播毛泽东思想当作了自己毕生的事业。
    国内外的阶级敌人最害怕毛泽东思想，他们千方百计地攻击和污蔑毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想的传播，必然要遇到他们顽强的抵制和反对。毛泽东思想的阵地每扩大一步，都不能不经过激烈的斗争。刘英俊同志对那些反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的谬论，保持了无产阶级革命战士应有的警觉，一经识破，就积极战斗，坚决反击。他是一个勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想的战斗员。
    刘英俊同志就是这样一个对毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰的人，就是这样一个坚决贯彻、坚决捍卫毛泽东思想的人。
    目前，我国无产阶级文化大革命正在轰轰烈烈地开展。这是一场十分尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，是资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的你死我活的斗争，是意识形态领域中无产阶级和资产阶级谁战胜谁的激烈而又长期的斗争。我们每一个干部战士，都要积极参加这场斗争，彻底粉碎资产阶级的进攻，坚决保卫社会主义制度，保卫无产阶级专政，保卫毛泽东思想。我们要象刘英俊同志那样，永远忠于党，忠于人民，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想。
    林彪同志号召我们继续突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，把毛主席的书当作全军各项工作的最高指示。学习刘英俊同志，对于贯彻执行这一指示，有着很大的意义。突出政治的落实，就是要大力加强毛泽东思想的教育，大抓活思想，培养出千千万万个象雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊这样的毛主席的好战士。
