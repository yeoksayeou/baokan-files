	Liu Yingjun's heart is the reddest,
	With boundless love for Chairman Mao.
	He studies Chairman Mao's works daily,
	Striving diligently to apply them in practice.
	He never forgets class struggle,
	And leads the way in emphasizing politics.

	Liu Yingjun's bones are the strongest,
	With the people's interests in his heart.
	He risks his life to control the horse,
	And bravely faces great dangers.
	His blood writes a heroic epic,
	His life and death are heavier than Mount Tai.

	The revolutionary furnace forges heroes,
	Heroes with red hearts and the strongest bones.
	Everyone learns from Liu Yingjun,
	Devoting their hearts to the revolution.
	To liberate all humanity,
	Forever follow Chairman Mao.
