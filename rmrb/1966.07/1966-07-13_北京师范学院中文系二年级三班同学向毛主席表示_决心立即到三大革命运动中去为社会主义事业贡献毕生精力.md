Dear Party Central Committee and Most Respected Leader Chairman Mao:

We listened to the letter from seven students of Renmin University to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and we were so excited that we jumped up.

Dear Party, Respected Chairman Mao, for many years, from primary school to middle school and university, we have been constrained by the educational system of the bourgeoisie and the feudal class. We have been poisoned a lot. Especially Beijing Normal University, which is directly controlled by the former Beijing Municipal Committee, they implemented a series of revisionist measures in our school, such as material incentives, cutting off our political activities, and squeezing out the time for us to study "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." They have committed heinous crimes in our school. Now, we increasingly realize that the former Beijing Municipal Committee intended to cultivate us all into successors of bourgeois revisionism. Today, we will use Mao Zedong Thought to detoxify and declare war on the feudal and bourgeois educational system! For this, we propose the following suggestions:

1. Through the first stage of three months of half-work, half-study and half-farming, half-study, the poor and lower-middle peasants' education of us has been particularly great. We deeply feel that to transform ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause that the Party and the people need, to serve the Chinese people and the people of the world, we must leave the study room, go downstairs, and go to the countryside to study. Literary students who do not go to the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants cannot thoroughly reform their thoughts and truly master Mao Zedong Thought. Based on our experience, literary students must take the path of half-work, half-study and half-farming, half-study.

2. We are already second-year students. We urgently request to graduate early. The reasons are:
   1. What we lack the most is the class struggle viewpoint and proletarian feelings. Only the three great revolutionary movements are good battlefields for strengthening our class viewpoint, cultivating proletarian feelings, and actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought.
   2. We are a new force on the educational front. Currently, there are still many poor and lower-middle peasants who have not read or written! There are still many children of poor and lower-middle peasants who have not entered school! Today, we want to go to the workers and peasants, to return our knowledge to the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. We hope to go out and contribute our strength soon. Let us go to the vast world to temper ourselves!

3. We are students of Beijing Normal University. In the past, the scope of graduation allocation was limited to Beijing. Now, we firmly request to break this unreasonable allocation system. Revolutionary youth have aspirations in all directions. Where it is the most arduous, we will appear there. Workers and poor and lower-middle peasants need us, and we need workers and poor and lower-middle peasants more. Where there are workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, we will go there.

In the past, before graduation, we had to fill out a wish form, and the organization would allocate according to personal wishes and work needs. This created an excuse for some people with serious bourgeois thoughts to not obey the allocation. Chairman Mao teaches us to serve the people completely and thoroughly, but the method of filling out wish forms fosters some people's selfish thoughts. Therefore, we suggest reforming this system. Allocation should be completely arranged by the state.

Dear Party Central Committee, Respected Chairman Mao: Sunflowers face the sun, red hearts face the Party. We are ready to go to the three great revolutionary movements at your command, to contribute our lives to the socialist revolution and socialist construction!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Wish our most respected leader Chairman Mao eternal life!

	Beijing Normal University, Chinese Department, Class 3, Grade 2, All Students

　　北京师范学院中文系二年级三班同学向毛主席表示
　　决心立即到三大革命运动中去为社会主义事业贡献毕生精力亲爱的党中央最最敬爱的领袖毛主席：
    我们听了人民大学七位同学给党中央和毛主席的信，我们激动得跳了起来。
    亲爱的党，敬爱的毛主席，我们从小学读到中学、大学，十几年来一直受着资产阶级、封建阶级教育制度的束缚，受了不少毒。尤其北京师范学院是在前北京市委直接控制下的学校，他们在我院搞物质刺激，实行一系列修正主义措施，砍掉了我们的政治活动，挤掉了我们学习《毛泽东选集》的时间……，他们在我院犯下了滔天罪行。现在，我们越来越清楚地认识到，前北京市委是想把我们都培养成资产阶级修正主义接班人。今天，我们要用毛泽东思想消毒，向封建、资产阶级教育制度开战！为此我们提出以下几点建议：
    一，通过前一阶段三个月的半工半读、半农半读，贫下中农对我们的教育特别大，我们深深地体会到：要想把自己改造成党和人民需要的无产阶级革命事业接班人，为中国人民、为世界人民服务，就必须离开书斋，下楼出院，到农村去办学。文科学生不到工人、贫下中农中去，就不能彻底改造思想，不能真正把毛泽东思想学到手。根据我们的体会，文科学生必须走半工半读、半农半读的道路。
    二，我们已经是二年级的学生了，我们迫切要求提前毕业，理由是：
    1、我们最最缺少的是阶级斗争观点和无产阶级感情，只有三大革命运动，才是增强我们的阶级观点，培养无产阶级感情，活学活用毛泽东思想的好战场。
    2、我们是教育战线上的一支生力军。目前，还有多少贫下中农没读过书、写过字啊！还有多少贫下中农子女没有入学呵！我们今天要到工农中去，把知识还给工人，还给贫下中农，我们希望早些出去贡献自己的力量，快让我们到广阔的天地中去锻炼吧！
    三，我们是北京师范学院的学生，过去毕业分配的范围仅限北京。现在我们坚决要求打破这一不合理的分配制度。革命青年志在四方，哪里最艰苦，就出现在哪里。工人、贫下中农需要我们，我们更需要工人、贫下中农。哪里有工人、贫下中农，我们就到哪里去。
    过去毕业前夕，要填志愿表，组织上根据个人志愿和工作需要进行分配。这样给一些资产阶级思想严重的人造成不服从分配的借口。毛主席教导我们要完全彻底地为人民服务，而那种填写志愿表的办法却助长了一些人的私心杂念，所以，我们建议要改革这种制度，分配完全应该由国家安排。
    亲爱的党中央，敬爱的毛主席：葵花向阳，红心向党，只等党和毛主席一声令下，我们立即到三大革命运动中去，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设贡献毕生精力！
    中国共产党万岁！
    祝我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
        北京师范学院中文系二年级三班全体同学
