African and Asian writers participating in the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Conference have continued their visits to various places, including Changsha, Xiangtan, Anshan, Shenyang, Nanchang, and Xi'an. During these visits, they have enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought and hailed Chairman Mao as the red sun in the hearts of the people of all countries.

Mao's Words Guide the World Revolution

On July 20, foreign friends visited the exhibition hall of revolutionary relics from Mao Zedong's youth at the First Normal School of Hunan Province in Changsha. Mohamed Dahane from the French Somaliland said, "Every word of Chairman Mao is precious. Each word is related to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Since 1919, Chairman Mao has not only been engaged in revolutionary activities to transform all of Chinese society but also in activities to transform the entire world, making China the cradle of the world revolution."

On July 21, Afro-Asian friends arrived in Xiangtan County, Shaoshan, to visit the former residence of Comrade Mao Zedong. After listening to the introduction about how young Mao Zedong often pounded rice in this small house, Abusalam Bahulu from Mozambique could no longer contain his excitement and stepped onto the pestle to pound rice. He said, "After visiting the place where Chairman Mao Zedong worked, I feel that Chairman Mao has never been separated from the peasants. He is a true Marxist. He is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also the leader of the revolutionary people of the world. The people of the world place their hopes in Mao Zedong Thought." After visiting the exhibition hall of the former residence, which displays pictures and artifacts, Afro-Asian friends wrote in the guest book, enthusiastically praising the great Mao Zedong Thought. Kongolo Kibwe Constantine from Congo (Leopoldville) wrote, "The Congolese people have always revered Mao Zedong Thought. Because Mao Zedong Thought is a torch that illuminates all humanity and a compass that points the way for the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

On July 23, Afro-Asian friends arrived in Nanchang and visited the August 1 Uprising Memorial Hall. Kongolo Kibwe Constantine, who came from the front lines of anti-imperialist and anti-colonial armed struggle in Congo (Leopoldville), said, "This visit allowed us to see the arduous struggle process of the Chinese revolution, which took more than twenty years of armed struggle to achieve victory. This victory was achieved under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party. This is a very good experience for the people of other countries, such as our country. To achieve revolutionary victory, one must learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought; otherwise, one will take the wrong path."

Mao Zedong Thought is the Unsetting Sun

On July 20, Lao representative Julamani visited Anshan Steel Works and said, "With Mao Zedong Thought, any human miracle can be created. Anshan Steel Works, from small to large, from few to many, from weak to strong, and from low-quality to high-quality products, is the result of the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought. The great achievements of Anshan Steel Works show that Mao Zedong Thought has deeply entered people's hearts. Mao Zedong Thought is the unsetting sun."

Cameroon representative Musong said, "People all over the world love Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought has universal significance. It belongs not only to the Chinese people but also to the revolutionary people of the world. Imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism fiercely oppose Mao Zedong Thought, which fully shows the unparalleled correctness of Mao Zedong Thought. The more they oppose it, the more we must defend it. This is not only the task of the Chinese people but also the task of the Cameroonian people."

On July 21, another group of Afro-Asian friends visited the "Eighth Route Army Xi'an Office Memorial Hall" and the Xi'an High-Voltage Ceramic Factory. The workers of the factory introduced that after the Soviet revisionists tore up the agreement and withdrew their experts, the entire factory, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle to establish the factory. Nancy Grant, a writer from Sierra Leone, excitedly said, "This is what we like to see the most. It is inspiring for us African countries." While visiting some equipment and instruments supplied by the Soviet revisionist leadership that were fundamentally unusable, Philippine representative Amado Hernandez said, "Although this is a bad thing, it is also a good thing. It can be placed here for the Afro-Asian people to see and better recognize the true face of Soviet revisionism."

On July 23, Afro-Asian writer friends visited the national model unit Xi'an People's Enamel Factory. When friends learned that this factory was established by all the workers under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, starting from scratch, self-reliant, and through hard struggle, they praised it highly. Thai representative Chabap Luepali said, "Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will produce tremendous power. I believe you will study Chairman Mao's works better and make continuous progress."

Mao Zedong Thought Guides the World People in Anti-Imperialism and Anti-Revisionism

On July 21, some Afro-Asian writer friends visiting the Northeast region held a symposium with a group of active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the industrial, commercial, financial, and educational systems of Liaoning Province and Shenyang City. Pakistani representative Shakkat Sidiki excitedly said, "Mao Zedong Thought has become your driving force. It is Chairman Mao's teachings that make you understand that you should serve the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. I decide to translate 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' into our national language when I return home, so that our people can understand how the Chinese people have achieved their successes."

On July 22, Nancy Grant, a writer from Sierra Leone, visited the state-owned Northwest Fourth Cotton Textile Mill and the state-owned First Dyeing Factory. During a talk with workers in the workers' dormitory, she said, "We love Chairman Mao's works as much as you do. I have finished reading all four volumes of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong.' Chairman Mao's judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is particularly important. Imperialism and socialism are opposed to each other. How can they coexist peacefully? While opposing American imperialism, we must also oppose the running dogs of American imperialism. When I go back, I will educate the women in our country to take Chinese women as an example to learn from."

On July 23, Afro-Asian friends visited the national model unit Xi'an People's Enamel Factory and had a symposium with workers, peasants, and soldiers who actively study Chairman Mao's works. Angolan representative Viriato da Cruz said, Mao Zedong Thought is the universal truth of the world revolution. Now, China is the center of the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought guides the people of the world to oppose American imperialism and modern revisionism.

    亚非作家在各地参观访问时热烈歌颂毛主席
    毛泽东思想照亮了全人类
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：参加亚非作家紧急会议的各国代表，分别在长沙、湘潭、鞍山、沈阳、南昌、西安等地继续进行参观访问时，热烈赞扬毛泽东思想，歌颂毛主席是各国人民心中的红太阳。
    毛主席每一句话都关系到世界革命
    外国朋友二十日在长沙湖南省第一师范学校里，参观了毛主席青年时代革命文物陈列室。索马里海岸（法属）代表穆罕默德·达汉说：“毛主席的每一句话都是很宝贵的，每一句话都关系到中国革命和世界革命。从一九一九年起，毛主席就不仅从事改造整个中国社会的革命活动，而且从事改造整个世界的革命活动，使中国成为世界革命的摇篮。”
    二十一日，亚非朋友到达湘潭县韶山参观毛泽东同志的旧居。莫三鼻给的阿布萨隆·巴胡尔在参观毛主席旧居的碓屋，听了介绍少年时代的毛泽东同志常常在这间小屋子里踩着这架石碓舂米的情况后，再也按捺不住内心的激动，便走上碓架，踩起石碓来。他说：“参观了毛泽东主席劳动过的地方，我感到毛泽东主席从来没有脱离过农民。他是一个真正的马克思主义者。他不仅是中国人民的领袖，也是世界革命人民的领袖，全世界人民都把希望寄托于毛泽东思想。”亚非朋友们参观了旧居陈列馆里的图片、实物以后，在留言簿上题词，热情赞扬伟大的毛泽东思想。刚果（利）代表基布韦·康士坦丁在题词中写道：“刚果人民一向尊崇毛泽东思想。因为毛泽东思想是一支照亮全人类的火炬，是为被压迫的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民指出方向的罗盘。”
    二十三日亚非朋友到达南昌，在参观南昌“八一”起义纪念馆时，来自反帝反殖武装斗争前线的刚果
  （利）朋友基布韦·康士坦丁说：我们这次参观，看到了中国革命经过二十多年的武装斗争取得胜利的艰苦斗争过程。这一胜利是在毛泽东同志和中国共产党的领导下取得的，这对于其他国家的人民，比如我们国家的人民，是个很好的经验。要取得革命的胜利，必须学习和运用毛泽东思想，否则就会走上错误的道路。
    毛泽东思想是不落的太阳
    二十日，老挝代表朱拉马尼访问鞍钢时说：“有了毛泽东思想，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来。鞍钢从小到大，从少到多，从力量单薄到力量强大，产品从质量低到质量高，就是毛泽东思想光芒照射的结果。鞍钢的巨大成就，说明了毛泽东思想已深入人心，毛泽东思想是不落的太阳。”
    喀麦隆代表木松说：“全世界人民都热爱毛主席。毛泽东思想具有普遍意义，它不仅属于中国人民，也属于全世界革命人民。帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义竭力反对毛泽东思想，这就充分说明毛泽东思想的无比正确，他们越反对，我们就越要捍卫，这不仅是中国人民的任务，也是喀麦隆人民的任务。”
    二十一日，另一部分亚非朋友们怀着极大的兴趣，参观了“八路军西安办事处纪念馆”和西安高压电瓷厂。高压电瓷厂的职工介绍说，这个工厂是苏联修正主义撕毁协议撤走专家以后，全厂职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神建立起来的。塞拉勒窝内作家南西·格兰特夫人激动地说：“这是我们最喜欢看的，这对我们非洲国家是个鼓舞。”在参观苏联修正主义领导集团供应的一些根本不能使用的设备器材时，菲律宾代表阿马多·埃尔南德斯说，这虽然是件坏事，但也是好事，放在这里，可以给亚非人民看看，能更加认清苏联修正主义的真面目。
    二十三日，亚非作家朋友参观了全国大庆式先进单位西安人民搪瓷厂。当朋友们知道这个工厂是全体职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，白手起家、自力更生、艰苦奋斗建立起来的新型社会主义企业时，称赞不已。泰国代表差慝·柿巴立说：“毛泽东思想一旦被人民群众所掌握，就会产生了不起的威力，相信你们会更好地学习毛主席著作，不断地进步。”
    毛泽东思想指引世界人民反帝反修
    二十一日，访问东北地区的部分亚非作家朋友们同辽宁省和沈阳市工业、财贸、文教系统的一批学习毛主席著作积极分子举行座谈。巴基斯坦代表肖卡特·西迪基激动地说：“毛泽东思想已经成为你们的动力。是毛主席的教导，使你们懂得要为中国革命和世界革命服务。我决定回国把《毛泽东选集》翻译成我们国家的文字，使我国人民了解中国人民是如何取得成就的。”
    塞拉勒窝内作家南西·格兰特夫人二十二日在访问国营西北第四棉纺织厂和国营第一印染厂时，在工人宿舍里和工人座谈时说：“我们和你们一样热爱毛主席著作，我把《毛泽东选集》四卷都已读完了，毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断特别重要。帝国主义和社会主义是对立的，怎么能在一起和平共处呢？在反对美帝国主义的同时，一定要反对美帝国主义的帮凶。我回去以后，要教育我们国家的妇女，把中国妇女当成学习的榜样。”
    二十三日，亚非朋友在参观大庆式先进单位西安人民搪瓷厂时，还和工农兵学习毛主席著作积极分子座谈。安哥拉代表维里亚托·达克鲁斯说，毛泽东思想是世界革命的普遍真理。现在，中国是世界革命的中心，毛泽东思想指引着全世界人民反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义。
