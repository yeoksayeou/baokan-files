Now, the call to oppose American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and to support the Vietnamese people's brave struggle for national liberation and self-defense has become a nationwide sentiment among the Japanese people. The Japanese people are waging struggles across the country to oppose American imperialism's use of Japan, under the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," as the largest supply, training, and rest base for U.S. troops invading Vietnam; and to oppose the reactionary forces in Japan providing active assistance to the United States. This is a great encouragement to the Asian and African peoples who are fighting bravely to shatter the imperialism and neocolonialism led by American imperialism.

While expanding its aggression against Vietnam, American imperialism is strengthening the military and economic aggression system linking Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan to repair its so-called "containment" policy against China, plotting to gather the puppet regimes in Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia together; and the Japanese reactionary forces are taking advantage of this to collude with the United States, increasingly revealing their ambition to invade Asia again. The emergency meeting of Asian and African writers held in Beijing noted this, believing that smashing this plot is an extremely urgent task for the peoples of Asia and the world in their struggle for independence and peace, and fully supporting the struggle of the Japanese people against this plot.

The meeting firmly supports the Japanese people in their persistent struggle against American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam; to abolish the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," oppose the so-called "two Chinas" policy, promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, smash the "Japan-South Korea Treaty," support the independent reunification of North and South Korea, demand the return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, withdraw U.S. military bases and troops from Japan, prevent U.S. nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers from entering Japanese ports, oppose Japan's nuclear armament and the establishment of nuclear bases, oppose the dispatch of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" abroad, oppose the revision of the Japanese Constitution, oppose the small electoral district system, and prevent the revival of Japanese militarism, and other policies, and to wage a broad and powerful struggle.

    关于支持日本人民斗争的决议
    现在，反对美帝国主义侵略越南、支持越南人民英勇的抗美救国斗争的呼声，已经成为日本人民全国性的舆论。日本人民正在全国各地开展斗争，反对美帝国主义根据“日美安全条约”把日本用来作为侵越美军的最大补给、训练和休养基地；反对日本反动势力给予美国积极协助。这对于为争取粉碎以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义而坚持英勇斗争的亚非人民也是巨大的鼓舞。
    美帝国主义在扩大侵略越南的同时，为修补所谓“遏制”中国政策，正在加强连结日本、南朝鲜、台湾的军事侵略经济体制，阴谋把东北亚和东南亚傀儡政权纠集在一起；而日本反动势力也正在乘机和美国勾结，日益明显地暴露出它再度侵略亚洲的野心。在北京举行的支援越南的亚非作家紧急会议注意到这一点，认为粉碎这种阴谋是亚洲和世界人民争取独立和和平的极为紧急的任务，全面支持日本人民反对这种阴谋的斗争。
    会议坚决支持日本人民坚持反对美帝国主义侵略越南；废除“日美安全条约”，反对所谓“两个中国”的政策，促进中日恢复邦交，粉碎“日韩条约”，支持南北朝鲜自主统一，要求归还冲绳和小笠原群岛，撤除在日本的美国军事基地和撤退美军，阻止美国核潜艇和核舰队进驻日本港口，反对日本核武装和核基地化，反对日本“自卫队”派往国外，反对修改日本宪法，反对小选举区制，阻止复活日本军国主义等各项方针，而展开的广泛、强有力的斗争。
