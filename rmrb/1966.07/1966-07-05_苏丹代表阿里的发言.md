	Sudanese Representative Muhammad Ali spoke at the emergency conference of Asian and African writers, stating that the heroic Vietnamese people's resolute struggle against American aggressors has become the focal point of international struggle. Therefore, our genuine support for the Vietnamese people is also support for the cause of the peoples of Asia and Africa, and support for all peoples fighting for national liberation. He pointed out that the failure of American imperialism in the Vietnam War further confirms the words of Comrade Mao Zedong: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers."

	He said, just as American imperialism is tottering under the powerful blows of the Vietnamese people, the new leadership of the Soviet Union has put forward the so-called "joint action" slogan. He pointed out that the Soviet revisionists have already betrayed proletarian internationalism; the starting point of their policies and lines is Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world. He said, there is no "joint action" with those who betray the people's cause, no "joint action" with those who join the ranks opposing the national liberation movement, and no "joint action" with those who aim to sabotage the socialist camp and the national liberation movement. The heroic Vietnamese people will continue their just war, and all revolutionary peoples support them. They will surely defeat the American aggressors.

	He said, the national liberation wars waged by the peoples of various countries against imperialism, which are forced by imperialism, are absolutely not and will never be factors that increase international tension. These wars are sacred and just wars. The more they strengthen, expand, and develop, the more the imperialist and war forces will be weakened. Therefore, they are important factors in maintaining world peace and eliminating the roots of new wars.

	He pointed out that the current international situation is good, favorable for revolution, and favorable for the national liberation cause. Despite the sabotage by revisionists attempting to split our ranks and disperse our strength, the situation is still developing in a direction favorable for revolution and for all revolutionaries around the world.

	He expressed his support for the Third Conference of Asian and African Writers to be held in Beijing.

    苏丹代表阿里的发言
    新华社四日讯　苏丹代表穆罕默德·阿里在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，英雄的越南人民反对美国侵略者的顽强斗争，已成为国际斗争的焦点。因此，我们向越南人民提供的真正支持，也就是对亚非各国人民事业的支持，是对所有争取民族解放而斗争的人民的支持。他指出，美帝国主义在侵略越南战争中的失败，更加证实了毛泽东同志的话：“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”。
    他说，正当美帝国主义在越南人民强有力的打击下摇摇欲坠的时候，苏联新领导提出了所谓“联合行动”的口号。他指出，苏联修正主义者已经违背了无产阶级国际主义，他们的政策和路线的出发点就是苏美合作主宰世界。他说，跟出卖人民事业的人没有什么“联合行动”，跟加入反对民族解放运动行列的人，没有什么“联合行动”，跟一心想破坏社会主义阵营、破坏民族解放运动的人，没有什么“联合行动”。英雄的越南人民将继续他们的正义战争，所有革命的人民都支持他们，他们必将战胜美国侵略者。
    他说，各国人民为反对帝国主义而被迫进行的民族解放战争，绝没有也绝不会成为增加国际紧张局势的因素。这些战争是神圣的、正义的战争，它越加强、越扩大、越发展，帝国主义和战争势力就越削弱，所以它是维护世界和平和消灭新战争根源的重要因素。
    他指出，当前的国际形势很好，有利于革命，有利于民族解放事业。尽管修正主义者进行破坏，企图分裂我们的队伍，分散我们的力量，但形势还是朝着有利于革命，有利于全世界革命者的方向发展。
    他表示赞成第三届亚非作家会议在北京举行。
