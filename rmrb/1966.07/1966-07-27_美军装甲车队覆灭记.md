A U.S. Armored Convoy Annihilated

Ambush in the Forest

On the morning of June 8 this year, the sun shone brightly over a dense forest in the southern region of Dong Nai Province in South Vietnam. The 13th Highway, which runs through Lai Thieu, Han Tu, Luc Ninh, and Binh Long, stretches through the forest into the distance.

An American reconnaissance plane took off slowly from Tan Phuoc Town, flying low and close to the ground. Then, enemy helicopters, "Skyraiders," and jet fighters roared in, indiscriminately bombing the forest on both sides of the highway.

At this time, in the command post of a certain unit of the Liberation Army, reports were coming in one after another:

"The 3rd Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division of the U.S. Army in Lai Thieu is stirring."

"The U.S. tank and armored car convoys are preparing to move out..."

At 11:30 a.m., a U.S. armored car regiment advanced along the 13th Highway, groping its way towards Binh Long City. In the sky, various enemy planes were circling. The enemy's artillery from Tan Phuoc and Han Tu was indiscriminately shelling the forest. The troops of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division were also advancing along the 13th Highway to rescue the puppet troops who had been besieged by the Liberation Army in Luc Ninh, Han Tu, and other places since May. However, they did not realize that they had already entered the death zone.

Despite being in their vehicles and having soldiers from the puppet 5th Division clearing the way, these American invaders still fired randomly along the way to boost their own morale.

Cutting Off the Convoy

At 1:15 p.m., the front few enemy vehicles had already crossed the Du U Bridge and entered the Dry Pond Bridge area. Suddenly, the battle began. The U.S. forces were hit by a sudden, fierce attack and were immediately cut in two. One unit of the Liberation Army quickly rushed onto the highway, blocking the advance of the enemy convoy. Another unit of the Liberation Army quickly blocked the last vehicle of the enemy convoy. Thus, the Liberation Army surrounded the entire enemy convoy in a narrow strip of land about three kilometers long.

The Liberation Army soldiers fought like tigers, striking the enemy fiercely and gaining the upper hand from the outset. At the same time, the Liberation Army units also launched attacks on the puppet troops guarding the road.

At this point, the U.S. convoy was like a headless snake, panicked and in chaos. The enemy planes in the sky could not communicate with the ground forces and were also subjected to fierce ground fire from the Liberation Army, forcing them to flee the battlefield. Some American air pirates daringly flew over the battlefield to drop smoke bombs, but they were quickly shot down by the Liberation Army's artillery.

Heroic Bravery

The battle intensified. The brave deputy squad leader Ah Cheng used two anti-tank shells to destroy one M-41 tank and one M-113 armored car. As the American soldiers lifted the tank hatch, ready to fire their machine guns, the Liberation Army soldier, deputy squad leader Ah Hai, quickly jumped onto the tank. Seeing the situation, the American soldier hastily closed the hatch, but Ah Hai was quick and accurate, grabbing the soldier's head with one hand and quickly stuffing a hand grenade into the tank, destroying it.

Gunner Ah Nam was firing intensively, covering his comrades. When he turned his head, he suddenly saw an M-41 tank charging towards him, only two meters away. He quickly rolled under the tank, avoiding the moving tracks. As the tank passed over him, he quickly got up and blew it up with a hand grenade.

Complete Annihilation

The entire armored car regiment was completely annihilated by the Liberation Army. The American invaders hastily dispatched a convoy, including five M-41 tanks, four M-113 armored cars, and six military transport vehicles, to bring reinforcements from Chau Doc. The Liberation Army soldiers, with the courage to defeat the American bandits, immediately intercepted this enemy reinforcement, destroying three M-41 tanks, four M-113 armored cars, and six military transport vehicles. The remaining two M-41 tanks, frightened, rolled back to Chau Doc.

The sound of gunfire on the battlefield gradually subsided. The wreckage of tanks, armored cars, and military transport vehicles lay scattered across the battlefield, emitting black smoke and a burning smell. The bodies of U.S. and puppet soldiers lay haphazardly on the roadside and in the vehicles. Some American soldiers did not even have time to fire a shot before they were killed.

The victorious Liberation Army soldiers, carrying their spoils, safely withdrew from the battlefield.

### 美军装甲车队覆灭记

    美军装甲车队覆灭记
    密林埋伏
    今年六月八日早晨，灿烂的阳光照耀着越南南方南部东区土龙木省一片茂密的森林。横贯莱眺、汉管、禄宁、平龙四地的第十三号公路穿过森林伸向远方。
    一架美国侦察机从真诚镇缓缓起飞，侧着身子挨近路面飞来。接着，敌人的直升飞机、“空中袭击者”驱逐机和喷气式飞机气势汹汹地飞来，对公路两旁的森林进行狂轰滥炸。
    这时，在解放军某部的指挥所里，收到了接踵而来的报告：
    “莱溪美军第一步兵师第三旅正蠢蠢欲动。”
    “美军坦克车队和装甲车队正准备出动……”
    十一点三十分。美军一个装甲车团沿着十三号公路开来，朝着平龙市的方向摸索前进。天上，各种敌机在盘旋。敌人的大炮，从真诚和汉管向森林滥肆轰击。美国第一步兵师的部队也沿着第十三号公路，前往解救五月以来被解放军围困在禄宁、汉管等地的伪军。但是，他们没想到自己已进入了死亡区。
    这些美国侵略军尽管躲在车子里，又有伪军第五师的士兵为它开路，但沿途仍然胡乱地开枪扫射，来壮自己的胆子。
    拦腰切断
    下午一点十五分，前面几辆敌人军车已经驶过斗乌桥，并且进入干潭桥地区。突然，战斗打响了。美军遭到了突如其来的猛烈打击，一下子被切成两截。一支解放军部队迅速地冲上公路，挡住了敌军车队的先头部分。另一支解放军部队也迅速卡住了敌人车队的最后一辆。这样，解放军把全部敌人的车队都包围在三公里长的狭窄地带里。
    解放军战士们勇如猛虎，狠狠地打击敌人，在战斗一开始就占了压倒的优势。与此同时，解放军的部队还向护路的伪军发动袭击。
    这时，美军车队便象一条断了头的蛇一样，六神无主，一片混乱。天空的美机不能和地面上的敌人取得联系，又遭到解放军的地面炮火的猛烈射击，不得不逃离阵地上空。有些美国空中强盗冒险冲到阵地上空投烟幕弹，但很快就被解放军的炮火打落了。
    英雄虎胆
    战斗越打越激烈。英勇的解放军副排长阿成用两发反坦克炮弹就击毁M—41型坦克车和M—113型装甲车各一辆。美国兵刚掀开坦克车盖子，准备用机枪扫射，已经逼近了坦克车的解放军战士、副班长阿海迅速跳上坦克，这名美军见势不妙，慌忙关起车盖子，但阿海眼明手快，一只手揪住这家伙的脑袋，另一只手迅速把一颗手雷塞进车子里，炸毁了这辆坦克。
    射击手阿南正在猛烈射击，掩护战友们。当他转过头来，忽然发现一辆M—41型坦克朝他冲过来，而且离他只有两米远了。他立刻敏捷地往坦克车底的中心滚去。他的动作无比准确、迅速，避开了滚动着的履带。这辆坦克刚从他身上越过，他又霍地爬起来，用手雷把它炸毁。
    彻底歼灭
    整个装甲车团被解放军完全彻底消灭了。美国侵略者又急急忙忙派出包括M—41型坦克五辆，M—113型装甲车四辆和军用运输车六辆的一个车队，把援军从佐城运来。解放军战士以决心战胜美国强盗的英勇作风，立即截击了这股敌人援军，消灭了M—41型坦克三辆、M—113型装甲车四辆和军用运输车六辆。残存的两辆M—41型坦克不敢继续战斗，落魂丧胆地滚回佐城。
    阵地上的枪声逐渐稀落。横七竖八地躺在阵地上的坦克车、装甲车、军用运输车的残骸升起股股黑烟，并发出一阵阵焦臭味。美军、伪军的尸体在路边和车子里胡乱地躺满了。有的美军还来不及开一枪便丧了命。
    胜利完成战斗任务的解放军战士们带着战利品，安全地撤出了阵地。
