The Albanian "People's Voice" newspaper has exposed how the American imperialists are eagerly "building bridges" with the Soviet modern revisionists, encouraging the "peaceful evolution" of the Soviet Union. The article emphasizes that without resolute and determined struggle against both imperialism and modern revisionism, it is impossible to achieve victory in the struggle against imperialism, to defend freedom and national independence, and to build socialism.

The article points out that U.S. President Johnson recently reiterated that the U.S. government will continue to "build bridges" over the chasm that separates the United States from Eastern Europe. Johnson links this "initiative" with the policy of American imperialism, which has been trying every means to encourage the peaceful evolution of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, with the aim of restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union.

The article further points out that the American imperialists want to "build bridges" with the Khrushchev revisionist leaders because they have betrayed the highest interests of socialist countries. They have become the greatest splitters of the communist movement and the most dangerous saboteurs of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. The deception of the revisionists cannot conceal this truth.

The article states that the Soviet leaders, in collusion with American imperialism and other reactionaries, are constantly working to establish a "ring of fire" around China. They are committing unprecedented treacherous crimes against the Vietnamese people, pretending to be friends of the Vietnamese people, and loudly proclaiming their "aid." They verbally condemn American imperialism but in reality, they are sabotaging the struggle of the Vietnamese people and helping American imperialism to extricate itself from its predicament. The material or political "aid" they provide to Vietnam is not only insignificant but also dangerous. They are doing this to find a way to intervene in the Vietnamese issue and to resolve it within the scope of Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world.

The Soviet leaders, while pretending to support the Vietnamese people, are using and plotting every means and trick to lead the Vietnamese people to the negotiating table with the aggressors, in order to help American imperialism and save it from inevitable disaster. They are trying to exchange the blood of the Vietnamese people for the friendship of imperialism.

The article also exposes how the Soviet leaders are making a fuss about European security and the danger of West German revanchism, but they themselves are sabotaging the fair resolution of the German issue and betraying the highest interests of the German Democratic Republic and the German people.

The article emphasizes that all this proves that modern revisionism, with the Soviet revisionist group at its helm, is now the most satisfactory top ally of American imperialism in its policy of aggression against the peoples of various countries. It is precisely this great help—the great betrayal of the Khrushchev revisionists—that has prompted American imperialism to build these "bridges" and to extend its bloody claws into the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries. For imperialism, it is now more appropriate and advantageous to pursue a strategy of peaceful evolution and capitalist restoration in revisionist countries, or as they say, a strategy of "building bridges," rather than a strategy of military force.

The article concludes by saying that only by continually defeating revisionism and by unremittingly and resolutely struggling to politically and ideologically eliminate revisionism can the revolutionary movement of the proletariat and the peoples of oppressed countries be rapidly expanded and strengthened. Only then can the proletariat and the peoples of oppressed countries more decisively and with greater confidence in ultimate victory wage their present and future revolutionary struggles.

　　阿《人民之声报》指出苏修集团已成美帝头号盟友
　　苏修妄图以越南人民鲜血换取美帝友谊
　　约翰逊加紧同苏“搭桥”促使苏联和东欧国家复辟资本主义
    据新华社地拉那十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央机关报《人民之声报》八日发表一篇编辑部文章，揭露美帝国主义竭力同苏联现代修正主义“搭桥”，鼓励苏联“和平演变”的阴谋。文章强调指出，如果不以同样的坚决态度和决心进行反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义两条战线的斗争，就不能胜利地进行反对帝国主义的斗争，就不能捍卫自由和民族独立，就不能建设社会主义。
    文章指出，美国总统约翰逊最近再次声称，美国政府将继续在把美国同东欧分开的鸿沟上面
  “搭桥”。约翰逊把这种“主动”同美帝国主义迄今奉行的政策联系起来，这种政策是想尽办法鼓励苏联和东欧国家的和平演变，其目的在于在苏联复辟资本主义。
    文章接着指出，美帝国主义者所以要同赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导人“搭桥”，那是因为他们出卖了社会主义各国的最高利益，因为他们已成为共产主义运动的最大的分裂者和各国人民革命斗争的最危险的破坏者。修正主义者的欺骗是决计掩盖不了这一真相的。
    文章说，苏联领导人勾结美帝国主义和其他反动派，每日每时都在为建立对中国的“火力包围圈”而不断出力。他们正在对越南人民犯下无耻的大叛卖的空前滔天罪行，他们假装成是越南人民的朋友，大肆宣传他们的“援助”，他们在口头上骂美帝国主义，实际上竭力破坏越南人民的斗争和帮助美帝国主义摆脱它陷进的绝境。他们给予越南的物质或政治“援助”，不仅是微不足道的，而且是危险的。他们这样做是为了寻找一个办法，以便插手越南问题和在苏美合作主宰世界的范围内来解决越南问题。
    苏联领导人假装支持越南人民，使用和策划了一切手段和阴谋，要把越南人民引到同侵略者进行“和谈”的桌子旁边，以便帮助美帝国主义和使美帝国主义免于不可避免的灾难。他们企图用越南人民的鲜血换取帝国主义向他们表示的友谊。
    文章还揭露苏联领导人正就欧洲安全和西德复仇主义的危险大肆喧嚷，但是他们自己破坏了德国问题的公正解决，出卖民主德国和德国人民的最高利益。
    文章强调指出，这一切证明，以苏联修正主义集团为首的现代修正主义现在是美帝国主义对各国人民推行侵略政策的最称心的头号盟友。正是这种大帮忙——赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的这种大叛卖，才促使美帝国主义搭这些“桥”和把它的血腥魔爪伸进苏联和其他东欧国家。对帝国主义来说，现在对修正主义国家推行和平演变、推行复辟资本主义的策略或者如同他们所说的“搭桥”的策略，比采取武力的策略更为适宜和有利。
    文章最后说，只有使修正主义不断地遭到失败，只有不懈地和坚决地为从政治上和意识形态上彻底消灭修正主义而斗争，才有可能迅速地扩大和加强无产阶级和被压迫各国人民的革命运动，无产阶级和被压迫各国人民才有可能更加果断地和对最后胜利更加满怀信心地进行现在和将来的革命斗争。
