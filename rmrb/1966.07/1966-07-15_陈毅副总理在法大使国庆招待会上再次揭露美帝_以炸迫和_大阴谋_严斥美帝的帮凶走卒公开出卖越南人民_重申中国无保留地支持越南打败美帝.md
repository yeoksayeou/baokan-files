Vice Premier Chen Yi, at the French Ambassador's National Day reception, once again exposed the U.S. imperialism's "bombing to force peace" plot, severely denounced the U.S. imperialism's henchmen for openly betraying the Vietnamese people, and reaffirmed China's unconditional support for Vietnam in defeating U.S. imperialism.

New China News Agency, July 14th: French Ambassador to China, Lucien Paye, held a reception at the embassy this afternoon to celebrate the National Day of the French Republic.

Vice Premier Chen Yi was invited and delivered a speech. In his speech, he strongly condemned that the henchmen of U.S. imperialism are openly serving the U.S. imperialism's "bombing to force peace" plot on the Vietnamese issue. He also reaffirmed that the Chinese people will, as always, unconditionally support the Vietnamese people in driving the American aggressors out of Vietnam.

Those invited to the reception also included Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Fu Zuoyi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Bingnan, and other relevant officials from our country.

After the reception began, Ambassador Paye spoke first. In his speech, he reviewed the progress made in the past year in expanding cultural exchanges and economic ties between China and France, and expressed his hope for further development in this relationship.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France, the two countries have continuously strengthened their economic, trade, and cultural ties, and people-to-people exchanges have also increased. All of this is in line with the common aspirations of the peoples of both countries and will be beneficial for the further development of bilateral relations.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, in his speech, condemned that U.S. imperialism is following the same path as Hitler's fascism more than twenty years ago, persistently pursuing a policy of aggression and war worldwide, seriously threatening world peace. He said, U.S. imperialism is a greater aggressor than Hitler's fascism, and is the most dangerous enemy of all the peoples of the world. All countries and peoples that have been subjected to U.S. aggression, interference, control, and bullying are increasingly uniting to oppose U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war, and to defend world peace.

He emphasized that the heroic Vietnamese people are waging a just war of resistance against the U.S. and for national salvation. They are not only fighting to defend their own country and for national liberation but also for the maintenance of peace in Asia and the world. They have earned the great respect and firm support of all peace-loving countries and peoples around the world.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that while the U.S. imperialism brazenly bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, further escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam, the henchmen of U.S. imperialism were actively promoting so-called peaceful solutions to the Vietnamese issue, proposing what is essentially "unconditional negotiations." They completely ignored the fact that the U.S. had already thoroughly torn up the Geneva Accords and was carrying out naked aggression against the Vietnamese people. They did not dare to demand that the U.S. immediately stop its aggression against the entire Vietnam. They did not dare to demand that the U.S. immediately withdraw all its troops of aggression from Vietnam. This is openly serving the U.S. imperialism's "bombing to force peace" plot. This is the most open and blatant betrayal of the Vietnamese people.

Vice Premier Chen Yi stressed that as a participant in the Geneva Conference, China will always firmly support the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. We will, as always, unconditionally support the Vietnamese people in driving the American aggressors out of Vietnam. The 700 million Chinese people are determined to take any risks and pay any price to support our Vietnamese brothers until they achieve final victory.

He also said that all peace-loving countries and peoples around the world, as long as they unite and strive together, can defeat the U.S. imperialism's plans of aggression and war, and maintain world peace. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the French people for this goal.

Ambassadors from various countries to China were also invited to the reception.

　　陈毅副总理在法大使国庆招待会上再次揭露美帝“以炸迫和”大阴谋
　　严斥美帝的帮凶走卒公开出卖越南人民  重申中国无保留地支持越南打败美帝
    新华社十四日讯　法国驻中国大使吕西恩·佩耶今天下午在大使馆举行招待会，庆祝法兰西共和国国庆。
    陈毅副总理应邀出席并讲了话。他在讲话中再一次强烈谴责美帝国主义的帮凶和走卒正在越南问题上公然为美帝国主义“以炸迫和”的大阴谋效劳，并且重申中国人民将一如既往地无保留地支持越南人民把美国强盗从越南赶出去。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有人大常委会副委员长杨明轩，政协全国委员会副主席傅作义，外交部副部长王炳南，以及我国其他有关方面的负责人。
    招待会开始以后，佩耶大使首先讲话。他在讲话中回顾了过去一年里中法两国在扩大文化交流和经济往来方面所取得的进展，并且希望这种关系获得进一步发展。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，中法建交以来，两国经济、贸易、文化等各方面的关系不断增进，人民友好往来也日益增加。这一切都是符合两国人民的共同愿望的，并且将有助于今后两国关系的进一步发展。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中谴责美帝国主义正在走希特勒法西斯二十多年前的老路，在全世界坚持推行侵略政策和战争政策，严重地威胁着世界和平。他说，美帝国主义是比希特勒法西斯野心更大的侵略者，是全世界人民最危险的敌人。一切受到美国侵略、干涉、控制和欺负的国家和人民，正在日益广泛地联合起来，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫世界和平。
    他着重指出，英雄的越南人民正在胜利地进行着抗美救国的正义战争。他们不仅是为保卫自己祖国和争取民族解放而战斗，而且是为维护亚洲和世界和平而战斗。他们赢得了全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的极大尊敬和坚决支持。
    陈毅副总理说，正当美帝国主义悍然轰炸河内和海防，进一步扩大侵略越南战争的时候，美帝国主义的帮凶和走卒却大肆活动，鼓吹什么和平解决越南问题，提出实际上是“无条件谈判”的建议。他们根本不顾美国早就彻底撕毁了日内瓦协议、并且对越南人民进行了赤裸裸的侵略的事实。他们根本不敢要求美国立即停止对整个越南的侵略。他们根本不敢要求美国立即从越南撤出它的全部侵略军队。这是公然为美帝国主义“以炸迫和”的大阴谋效劳。这是对越南人民最公开露骨的出卖。
    陈毅副总理强调说，作为日内瓦会议的参加国，中国将始终不渝地支持越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。我们将一如既往，无保留地支持越南人民把美国强盗从越南赶出去。七亿中国人民决心不怕冒任何风险，不惜付出任何代价，支援兄弟的越南人民，直到取得最后胜利。
    他还说，全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民，只要团结起来，共同奋斗，美帝国主义的侵略和战争计划是可以挫败的，世界和平是可以维护的。中国人民愿意同法国人民为此而共同努力。
    各国驻华使节也应邀出席了招待会。
