The Beijing Physics Discussion Meeting of the 1966 Summer Science Discussion is now in session. On behalf of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology and the Chinese delegation of scientists attending the discussion meeting, I extend a warm welcome and cordial greetings to more than one hundred scientists from over thirty countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania who have come to participate in this meeting.

Under the joint efforts of scientists from the four continents, the Beijing Science Discussion Meeting was successfully held in Beijing in 1964. The communiqué of that meeting stated: "The conference hopes that between 1965 and 1968, some countries will be able to hold single-discipline or thematic scientific discussion meetings." Based on this common aspiration, the physicists from various countries who attended the Beijing Science Discussion Meeting unanimously suggested that a physics conference be held in Beijing in 1966. Over the past year, physicists from various countries have made tremendous efforts to convene this meeting. Relevant parties have carried out various preparatory work, and many friends have given us valuable assistance and support. Now, the physics discussion meeting that physicists from the four continents are concerned about has finally opened on schedule. The countries of the four continents have long been regarded by imperialists, old and new colonialists, and modern revisionists as "underdeveloped" countries. Today, we, the so-called "underdeveloped" countries' scientific workers, have gathered together to organize such a large-scale single-discipline academic discussion meeting. This is a very encouraging thing. It is a victory for the peoples of the four continents and a victory for the scientific and technological communities of the four continents.

Respected foreign colleagues, you have come to our capital to participate in this discussion meeting, overcoming various obstacles and difficulties. This shows your lofty aspirations for the development of science, technology, and culture in the four continents. Your participation in this discussion meeting not only brings your achievements in physics but also brings the friendship of the peoples of various countries to our country and people. We warmly welcome you to visit our country. You can see with your own eyes that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people and scientists are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, striving for self-reliance and working hard in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, achieving brilliant results. The scientific and technological foundation left by old China is extremely weak, and the achievements of our scientific and technological personnel are still far from meeting the needs of the country. At this discussion meeting, the delegates of the Chinese delegation of scientists will humbly learn from the scientists of various countries and, together with the scientists of various countries, will, in the spirit of democratic consultation, unity and cooperation, mutual learning, and common improvement, make this discussion meeting a success.

I wish all the representatives, friends, and comrades good health and smooth work!

    在北京物理讨论会开幕式上
    周培源团长的欢迎词
    新华社二十三日讯　中国科学技术协会副主席、中国科学家代表团团长周培源在北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会开幕式上的欢迎词，全文如下：亲爱的朋友们、同志们：
    北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会，今天隆重地开幕了。我代表中国科学技术协会和出席讨论会的中国科学家代表团，向前来参加讨论会的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲的三十多个国家的一百多位科学家表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的问候。
    在我们四大洲科学家的共同努力下，一九六四年在北京成功地举行了北京科学讨论会。在那次讨论会的公报上写着：“会议希望在一九六五年至一九六八年间，在一些国家能够举行单科性或专题性的科学讨论会。”根据这个共同愿望，当时出席北京科学讨论会的各国物理学家一致建议，一九六六年在北京举办一次物理学方面的国际学术会议。一年多以来，各国物理学家为召开这次会议作出了巨大努力。有关方面进行了各种筹备工作，许多朋友给了我们可贵的帮助和支持。现在，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲广大物理学家所关心的物理讨论会，终于如期地开幕了。我们四大洲的国家，一向被帝国主义者、新老殖民主义者和现代修正主义者看作是“不发达”的国家。今天，我们这些所谓“不发达”国家的科学工作者聚集在一起，组织这样大规模的单科性学术讨论会，这是一件令人十分鼓舞的事。这是四大洲人民的胜利，是四大洲科学技术界的胜利。
    尊敬的国外同行们，你们不辞劳苦，有的还克服了种种阻挠和困难，来到我国首都参加这次讨论会，这表示了你们对发展四大洲科学技术文化事业的崇高意愿。你们参加这次讨论会，不仅带来了你们在物理学上的成就，还带来了各国人民对我们国家和人民的友谊。我们热情地欢迎你们来我国访问。你们可以亲眼看到，我国人民和科学家在中国共产党和毛主席的英明正确领导下，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，自力更生，奋发图强，取得了辉煌成就。旧中国遗留下来的科学技术基础是极为薄弱的，我们科学技术人员所作出的成绩，还远不能满足国家的需要。在这次讨论会上，中国科学家代表团的同志们，将向与会的各国科学家虚心学习，并将同各国科学家一道，本着民主协商、团结合作、相互学习、共同提高的精神，把讨论会开好。
    祝各国代表们、朋友们、同志们身体健康，工作顺利！（附图片）
