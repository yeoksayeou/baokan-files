Workers, peasants, and soldiers must take the stage of socialist literature and art

Shanghai County, Hongqiao Commune, Shanghai City, Lù Xiǎoquán, Wáng Yǒngxiān

The republication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has greatly boosted the morale of us poor and lower-middle peasants and has thoroughly crushed the arrogance of all ghosts and monsters. The "Talks" shine like a beacon, illuminating our path forward and inspiring us to bravely fight against the black gang in the literary and artistic circles.

For a long time, people like Zhou Yang have opposed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois and revisionist black line in literature and art. They have seized key positions within the Party, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, distorting the proletarian direction of literature and art, and advocating for "literature and art for the whole people," turning proletarian literature and art into literature and art for landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They have allowed emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, foreigners, and the dead to dominate the proletarian literary and artistic front, attempting to achieve the restoration of capitalism. These people are truly heartless and treacherous. We, the laboring people, have worked hard to fatten you up, but you turn around and oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought. Let me tell you: You will never succeed!

"Different trees bloom different flowers, different classes speak different words." People like Zhou Yang have never looked upon us poor and lower-middle peasants as human beings. They have never created works that truly serve us workers, peasants, and soldiers, fully exposing their bourgeois reactionary nature. We belong to different classes, so we cannot understand each other, and we cannot walk the same path. The struggle between us is a life-and-death class struggle.

We poor and lower-middle peasants have revolutionary spirit. Although we have not attended foreign schools or received foreign education, we have the great Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, enabling us to participate in the three great revolutionary movements and achieve victory. We know whom to praise and whom to oppose. There are many new people and new things around us worth writing about. Under the shining light of the three red banners, our Hongqiao Commune has achieved a vegetable yield of ten thousand jin per mu for seven consecutive years. The leadership has called upon us to ensure that vegetables delivered to the market are the same in rainy and sunny weather, in slack and peak seasons, at the bottom and top of the basket, and with or without inspection, fully serving the urban laboring people. Upon hearing the call, the commune members were all spirited and full of fighting spirit, taking immediate action to sweat a little more and exert a little more effort to achieve the "four sameness." To boost the morale of the commune members, we created and performed the song "Planting Vegetables with the Eaters in Mind" based on many real-life examples. The performance at the "Shanghai Spring" was praised by workers, peasants, and soldiers as a song that expresses the revolutionary spirit of new farmers in the socialist era. We also performed at the television station, radio station, and more than ten factories, receiving enthusiastic support and congratulations from the broad revolutionary masses. The cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants in our commune all reflected: "The more we watch, the more energetic we feel; the more we sing, the happier we are. The performance on stage is hot and lively, and the audience below is captivated. We have more energy for production." Through this performance, we deeply felt that as long as we listen to Chairman Mao and act according to his instructions, creating works that truly serve workers, peasants, and soldiers and proletarian politics, we can gain the welcome of the broad masses and achieve the effect of uniting the people, educating the people, and striking and annihilating the enemy.

In the old society, farmers, who were always slandered by landlords and the bourgeoisie as "mud-legged," have today broken through the old rules and regulations of the masters and taken the stage of literature and art. This rare event in the world is a heavy blow to the "authorities" and "ancestors" of bourgeois literature and art! We warn people like Zhou Yang: Today is the era of the laboring people, and today's stage belongs to the laboring people! Since we poor and lower-middle peasants have the ability to turn barren mountains into grain fields, we also have the ability to take the stage of socialist literature and art.

Rereading "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has increased our fighting spirit. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overthrow all kinds of bourgeois "authorities," and let proletarian literature and art forever occupy the socialist literary and artistic front!

　　工农兵一定要登上社会主义的文艺舞台
　　上海市上海县虹桥公社　陆晓权　王永仙
    《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的重新发表，大长了我们贫下中农的志气，大灭了一切牛鬼蛇神的威风。《讲话》象灯塔一样照亮了我们前进的道路，鼓舞着我们更加勇敢地同文艺界黑帮坚决斗争。
    长期以来，周扬等人反对毛主席的文艺路线，顽固地坚持资产阶级、修正主义的文艺黑线。他们窃据党内要职，打着“红旗”反红旗，篡改文艺的工农兵方向，提倡什么
  “全民文艺”，把无产阶级文艺变为地富反坏右的文艺。他们让帝王将相、才子佳人、洋人、死人等统治着无产阶级的文艺阵地，企图实现资本主义的复辟。这些家伙真是狼心狗肺。我们劳动人民辛辛苦苦养肥了你们，你们却要反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想。告诉你们：绝对办不到！
      “什么树开什么花，什么阶级说什么话。”周扬等一伙人从来不把我们贫下中农劳动人民放在眼里，从来没有创作过真正为我们工农兵服务的作品，这就充分暴露了你们的资产阶级反动本质。我们和你们是不同阶级，说不到一块儿，走不到一条道，我们与你们之间的斗争是你死我活的阶级斗争。
    我们贫下中农是有革命志气的。我们虽然没有进过洋学堂、受过洋教育，但我们有伟大的毛泽东思想作武器，就能胜利地参加三大革命运动。我们懂得歌颂谁、反对谁。我们的身边就有许多新人新事值得我们大写特写。在三面红旗的光辉照耀下，我们虹桥公社连续七年蔬菜亩产达到万斤。领导上号召我们要在稳产、高产的基础上，上市的蔬菜做到四个一样：雨天和晴天一样，淡季和旺季一样，篮底和篮面一样，不检验和检验一样，全心全意为城市劳动人民服务。社员们听到号召后，个个意气风发，斗志昂扬，立即行动，为做到“四个一样”多流一点汗，多出一分力。为了鼓舞社员的斗志，我们就根据许多活生生的事例，创作了表演唱《种菜想着吃菜人》。节目在“上海之春”演出后，工农兵群众都说这支歌唱出了社会主义时代新农民的革命心声。我们还到电视台、广播电台和十几个工厂演唱，也受到广大革命职工的热情支持和祝贺。我们公社的干部和贫下中农都反映：“越看越有劲，越唱越开心，台上唱得热呼呼，台下看得出了神，生产起来更有劲。”通过这次演出，我们深深体会到，只要我们听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，创作真正为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的作品，就能得到广大群众的欢迎，起到团结人民、教育人民，打击敌人、消灭敌人的作用。
    在旧社会一向被地主和资产阶级的老爷们诬蔑为“泥腿子”的农民，今天冲破了老爷们的清规戒律，登上了文艺的舞台。这件世界上少有的事，对资产阶级文艺的“权威”、“祖师爷”，是当头一棒！我们正告周扬这伙人：今天是我们劳动人民的天下，今天的舞台是我们劳动人民的舞台！我们贫下中农既然有能力变荒山为粮田，也就有能力登上社会主义的文艺舞台。
    重新学习《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，增强了我们战斗的勇气。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，打倒形形色色的资产阶级“权威”，让无产阶级的文艺永远占领社会主义的文艺阵地！
