This issue of the economic news uses vivid facts to tell us that once the broad masses of the people grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought, they will generate tremendous material force!

Why can the people of the Dongting Lake area complete the electric power irrigation project a year ahead of schedule? Why can the people of Ren County, Hebei, achieve nearly a doubling of wheat production despite severe drought? Why can the people of Feidong County, Anhui, complete more than double the amount of guaranteed agricultural land in just over a year? The fundamental reason is that the people in these areas, with deep class sentiments, voluntarily and actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, mastering Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon. The spiritual face of the broad masses has changed, and the production landscape has undergone a fundamental transformation.

In the current tumultuous Cultural Revolution, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the struggle, more consciously study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must ride the east wind of the Cultural Revolution, grasp the key to class struggle, promote the thought revolutionization of people, and while resolutely carrying out the Cultural Revolution, resolutely carry out industrial and agricultural production and other construction projects, striving for a double victory in the Cultural Revolution and industrial and agricultural production.

Promoting the Thought Revolutionization of People through Mao Zedong Thought

Significant Development in Agricultural Water Conservancy Construction in Hunan

With the electric power irrigation project in the Dongting Lake area as the center, the basic agricultural construction task has been completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled; the electric power irrigation capacity increased over the past two years and more is equivalent to more than three times the total of the previous fourteen years before 1963; the effective irrigation area in the entire province has reached over 40 million mu

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 15th: Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing politics, and following the Dazhai path, Hunan Province has achieved significant results in basic agricultural construction centered on the electric power irrigation project in the Dongting Lake area.

The electric power irrigation project construction task, which began in April 1964 and was planned to be completed in three years, was completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled by May of this year. This includes 6,100-plus kilometers of agricultural high-voltage power lines, more than 60 large cross-iron towers, 90 substations, and 1,580-plus irrigation stations. The electric power irrigation capacity increased over the past two years and more is equivalent to more than three times the total of the previous fourteen years before 1963. Relevant departments pointed out that the construction speed of these electric power irrigation projects in the Dongting Lake area is unprecedented, and they have achieved the requirement of seeking both good quality and economy. The project quality meets the design standards, and the project cost has been gradually reduced year by year. According to statistics, the total investment for the entire electric power irrigation project is more than 20% less than the original state plan; at the same time, 74 large and medium-sized reservoirs built in 1958 and 1959 have basically completed their matching tasks, with water storage capacity increasing several times and expanding the beneficiary area.

Through construction and learning simultaneously, more than 30,000 professional and part-time technical teams have been trained. The growth of this technical team will play a significant role in future water conservancy construction and water conservancy facility maintenance and management, as well as in the development of agricultural mechanization and electrification.

The significant development in water conservancy construction has greatly improved the agricultural water conservancy conditions. The effective irrigation area in the entire province has reached 40.8 million mu, of which the drought-resistant and flood-resistant agricultural land has increased from 15 million mu in 1963 to over 24 million mu. The yield of beneficiary farmland has generally increased. In Changsha County's Jinggang District, due to the completion of the electric power irrigation network, water conservancy has basically been resolved, and the labor saved from drainage and drought resistance has been used for fine farming. Last year, the district achieved a bumper harvest of grain, with an average yield of over 900 jin per mu.

The significant development of basic agricultural construction centered on the electric power irrigation project has allowed the broad masses of commune members to see the happy and beautiful scene of a socialist new countryside, further recognizing the great superiority of the collective power of the people's commune. Every time a new project is put into production and benefits, the masses shout, "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The significant achievements made by Hunan Province in basic agricultural construction centered on the lake area electric power irrigation project in just over two years, realizing the requirements of being fast, good, and economical, are fundamentally due to reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Using Mao Zedong Thought to promote the thought revolutionization of people, thereby accelerating the entire project construction, is ultimately the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

In 1964, when the project construction just began, many construction sites established study groups for Chairman Mao's works, and some even set up communist night schools. They worked on construction during the day and studied Chairman Mao's works at night. Hundreds of thousands of cadres, workers, and laborers generally studied Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "Moving the Mountain," and "Pay Attention to Methods of Work" and other articles. They also discussed and praised good people and good deeds that emerged from studying Chairman Mao's works. Studying "Serve the People" praised selfless, public-spirited good examples; studying "Moving the Mountain" praised brave, persevering good examples who face difficulties head-on. In this way, many construction sites quickly presented a good situation of not seeking fame or profit, not fearing hardship, building water conservancy for the revolution, and building water conservancy with revolutionary spirit. They overcame various difficulties in project construction, such as lack of experience, technology, equipment, funds, and materials, and won the glorious victory of completing the Dongting Lake area electric power irrigation project ahead of schedule.

### 用毛泽东思想促进人的思想革命化　湖南农田水利基本建设大发展

    编者按：这一版经济新闻，用活生生的事实告诉我们，广大人民群众一旦掌握了伟大的毛泽东思想，将会产生多么巨大的物质力量！
    为什么洞庭湖区的人民，能够提前约一年时间建成电力排灌工程？为什么河北任县人民，在严重干旱的情况下，仍然使小麦增产近一倍？为什么安徽肥东县人民，在一年多时间内建成的保收农田，超过原有总数的一倍？根本的原因，是这些地区的人民怀着无比深厚的阶级感情，自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，掌握了毛泽东思想这一最锐利的武器。广大群众的精神面貌起了变化，生产的面貌也就随着发生了翻天覆地的变化。
    在当前轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，应该更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在斗争中更自觉地活学活用毛主席著作。我们要乘无产阶级文化大革命的东风，抓住阶级斗争的纲，促进人的思想革命化，在坚决搞好文化大革命的同时，坚决搞好工农业生产和其他各项建设事业，争取文化大革命和工农业生产双胜利。
    用毛泽东思想促进人的思想革命化
    湖南农田水利基本建设大发展
    以洞庭湖区电力排灌工程为中心的农田基本建设任务提前超额完成；两年多来增加的电力排灌能力等于一九六三年以前十四年总和的三倍多；全省有效灌溉面积已达四千多万亩
    新华社长沙十五日电高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，走大寨道路，湖南省以洞庭湖区电力排灌工程为中心的农田基本建设，取得了重大成就。
    从一九六四年四月开始的，计划三年完成的电力排灌工程建设任务，到今年五月就提前超额完成了。其中，包括农用高压输电线路六千一百多公里，大型跨越铁塔六十多座，变电站九十处，排灌站一千五百八十多处。两年多来增加的电力排灌能力，等于一九六三年以前十四年总和的三点一倍。有关部门指出，洞庭湖区这些电力排灌工程的建设速度是空前的，而且达到了好中求省的要求，工程质量符合设计标准，工程造价逐年降低，据统计，整个电力排灌工程所用的投资，比国家原来的计划减少了百分之二十以上；同时，一九五八年和一九五九年修建的七十四处大、中型水库，已基本上完成了配套任务，蓄水量成倍增加，扩大了受益面积。
    通过边建设、边学习，还培养了专业的和亦工亦农的技术队伍三万多人。这支技术队伍的成长，对今后的水利建设和水利设施的维护管理，对农村机械化、电气化事业的发展等都将发挥巨大作用。
    水利建设的大发展，大大地改善了农田水利条件。全省有效灌溉面积已达到四千零八十万亩，其中旱涝保收农田由一九六三年的一千五百万亩，增加到二千四百多万亩。受益农田的产量普遍有所提高。长沙县靖港区由于建成了电力排灌网，水利基本过关，把节约出来的排渍、抗旱的劳力用于精耕细作，去年粮食获得大面积丰收，全区平均亩产九百斤以上。
    以电力排灌工程为中心的农田基本建设的大发展，使广大社员看到了社会主义新农村的幸福美景，更加认清了人民公社集体力量的巨大优越性。每当新建的工程投产受益时，群众就高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    湖南省以湖区电力排灌为中心的农田基本建设，能够在两年多时间里取得这么伟大的成就，实现了多快好省的要求，最根本的经验就是读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，用毛泽东思想促进人的思想革命化，从而加速了整个工程建设，归根到底是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    一九六四年，工程建设刚开始，许多工地就建立了毛主席著作学习小组，有些还举办了共产主义夜校，白天搞建设，晚上学习毛主席著作，上百万的干部、工人和民工，普遍学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》等文章，并且对照张思德、白求恩、老愚公，联系思想和工作实际，开展讨论，大力表扬学习毛主席著作中涌现出来的好人好事。学习《为人民服务》，就表扬舍己为人、一心为公的好典型；学习《愚公移山》，就表扬英勇顽强、迎难而上的好典型。这样，许多工地很快就出现了不图名、不图利、不怕苦，为革命修水利，用革命精神修水利的大好局面，战胜了工程建设中缺经验、缺技术、缺设备、缺资金、缺器材等各种各样的困难，赢得了提前完成洞庭湖区电力排灌工程修建任务的辉煌胜利。
