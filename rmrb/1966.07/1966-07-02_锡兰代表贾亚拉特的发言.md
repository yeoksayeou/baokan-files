	Ceylon Representative Jayaratne's Speech

	Xinhua News Agency, July 1st: Ceylon Representative Jayaratne strongly condemned Soviet revisionists at the plenary session of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers today. He said, from our own experience, we know that modern revisionists will never support revolutionary peoples and struggles. They shout about supporting Vietnam, but in practice, they are completely collaborating with American imperialists to suppress and oppress the Vietnamese people.

	In his speech, Jayaratne also mentioned that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, are vigorously carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. At this moment, our gathering in Beijing as Asian and African writers is of great significance. The Cultural Revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is not only part of the world socialist movement but also part of the anti-imperialist and national liberation movement.

	Jayaratne pointed out that the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers was convened after the failure of the despicable and shameful plots of the Soviet revisionists. He pointed out that the decisions of the Cairo Conference were completely illegal. The Secretary-General of the Permanent Bureau, Senanayake, has made contributions to the establishment and consolidation of the Asian and African Writers' Organization. He stands at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism. If Senanayake has committed any serious crime, it is that he has never surrendered and never betrayed our cause.

	Jayaratne exposed that since the 1961 meeting of the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers in Colombo, Soviet revisionists have consistently colluded with imperialism to carry out a series of sabotage activities. When talking about the Soviet revisionists' strong opposition to holding an emergency meeting in Beijing at that time, he said, traitors to the revolution now do not even have the courage to come to the revolutionary center—Beijing, and those who have shaken hands with the blood-stained imperialists today do not even have the courage to shake hands with the upright and brave Asian and African writers.

	Jayaratne said, we understand the harm of revisionism, not through Beijing Radio, not through the Beijing *People's Daily*, and not through various publications in Beijing. Our experiences in Ceylon are enough for us to understand the dangers of revisionism.

	He condemned the collusion of Soviet revisionists and imperialists in attacking Ceylon and their plot to split all anti-imperialist organizations in Ceylon. He pointed out, is there any greater help for imperialism than this?

	He indignantly said, we know that you gentlemen have no poverty and oppression. You are afraid that your "happiness" will be destroyed in the anti-imperialist revolutionary war, which we do not find surprising. But we, the oppressed peoples of Asia and Africa, have no such concerns. We have nothing to lose, and what we will gain is the whole world. He said, "We want liberation, we want struggle. History has proven that bowing down to imperialism, being subservient, will not bring liberation. The only path to liberation is struggle. We are not afraid of struggle, and in struggle, we will not retreat. We are not hesitant about struggle, we are prepared for struggle, and in struggle, we do not hope to receive any assistance from you revisionist gentlemen."

	He said, we only demand one thing, that is, please take off the anti-imperialist mask and throw it aside, do not stand in our way, do not block our vision, do not cover up for imperialism, do not hinder our struggle, otherwise, we will sweep you away along with imperialism. We will firmly do this, because this is also part of the anti-imperialist struggle.

	He said, we love peace, we want peace, but imperialism does not allow us to live in peace. There can be no peace until imperialism is eliminated. Imperialism will not voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage with its weapons and privileges. To eliminate imperialism, we must arm the people.

	He said, the struggle in Vietnam is also our struggle. The struggle in Vietnam is the common struggle of the Asian and African peoples threatened by imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the arch-enemy of humanity, the United States. We have the responsibility and the duty to more strongly and actively support the heroic Vietnamese people.

	He said, it is a historical truth that the fate of the world is decided by the people, not by weapons. Led by the great revolutionary Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China leads the Chinese people to sweep away imperialism and its running dogs.

	Jayaratne said, we Asian and African writers cannot provide the Vietnamese people with guns, but we have our pens. We will use this pen to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people and strengthen the anti-American struggle of the peoples of various countries.

	When talking about the cultural aggression of imperialism, he said, as writers, we must use our pens to create, educate the people, awaken the people, enhance the people's combativeness, and organize the masses. This is our responsibility, this is our task.

    锡兰代表贾亚拉特的发言
    新华社一日讯　锡兰代表贾亚拉特今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上强烈谴责苏联修正主义者。他说，从我们的切身经验中知道，现代修正主义者永远不会支持革命的人民和斗争。他们叫嚷支持越南，而在行动上却完全是同美帝国主义者合作来镇压和压迫越南人民。
    贾亚拉特在发言中还谈到，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，正在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗胜利地进行文化大革命，在这样的时刻，我们亚非作家聚会北京是具有重大意义的。毛泽东思想指导下的这个文化大革命不仅是世界社会主义运动的一部分，而且也是反帝和民族解放运动的一部分。
    贾亚拉特指出，亚非作家紧急会议是在苏联修正主义者所进行的卑鄙可耻的阴谋活动失败以后召开的。他指出，开罗会议的决定是完全非法的。常设局秘书长森纳那亚克为建立和巩固亚非作家组织作出了贡献，他站在反对帝国主义、殖民主义和新殖民主义斗争的最前线。如果说森纳那亚克犯了什么严重的罪行，那就是他从来没有屈服过，从来没有出卖过我们的事业。
    贾亚拉特揭露了苏联修正主义者从一九六一年在科伦坡举行亚非作家常设局会议以来，就一贯勾结帝国主义进行一系列的破坏活动。在谈到苏联修正主义者当时极力反对在北京召开紧急会议时，他说，背叛革命的人现在连到革命中心——北京来的勇气都没有，同沾满鲜血的帝国主义者握过手的人今天连同正直的勇敢的亚非作家握手的勇气都没有。
    贾亚拉特说，我们了解修正主义的危害性，并不是通过北京电台，不是通过北京的《人民日报》，也不是通过北京的各种刊物。我们在锡兰取得的经验，使我们足以了解修正主义的危险性。
    他谴责苏联修正主义者和帝国主义互相勾结攻击锡兰，以及他们在锡兰分裂所有反帝　组织的阴谋活动。他指出，对帝国主义来说，难道还有比这更大的帮助吗？
    他愤慨地说，我们知道，你们这些老爷们没有什么贫困和压迫，你们害怕你们的“幸福”会在反帝革命的战争中毁灭，这我们并不感到奇怪。但是，我们亚非被压迫的人民没有这种顾虑，我们不会失去什么，我们将得到的是整个世界。他说，“我们要解放，我们要斗争。历史证明，对帝国主义卑躬屈膝，千依百顺，是不能得到解放的。解放的唯一道路是斗争。我们不害怕斗争，在斗争中我们决不退却，对于斗争，我们毫不犹豫，我们准备着斗争，在斗争中我们决不希望得到你们这些修正主义的老爷们的什么援助。”
    他说，我们要求的只有一个，那就是请你们把反对帝国主义的假面具摘下来丢到一边，不要站在我们的面前阻止我们，不要挡住我们的视线，不要掩护帝国主义，不要阻止我们的斗争，否则，我们就要把你们连同帝国主义一起，扫除干净。我们将坚定地这样作，因为这也是反帝斗争的一部分。
    他说，我们爱和平，我们要和平，但是帝国主义不允许我们平安地生活，帝国主义没有消灭以前不可能有和平。帝国主义不会放弃武力和特权，自动地退出历史舞台，要消灭帝国主义，只有通过武装人民。
    他说，越南的斗争也是我们的斗争。越南的斗争是遭受美国——以这个人类的死敌为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义威胁的亚非人民的共同斗争。我们有责任更有力更积极地支援英雄的越南人民。
    他说，决定世界命运的是人民不是武器，这是被历史证明了的真理。以伟大的革命家毛泽东为首的中国共产党领导中国人民，扫除了帝国主义及其走狗。
    贾亚拉特说，我们亚非作家无法给越南人民以枪炮，但是我们有我们的笔，我们要用这支笔来支持越南人民的斗争，加强各国人民的反美斗争。
    他在谈到帝国主义的文化侵略时说，作为作家，我们要用自己的笔进行创作，使人民得到教育，使人民觉醒，提高人民的战斗性，把人民群众组织起来，这就是我们的责任，这就是我们的任务。
