Members of the Guangzhou Military Region's Sea Cultural Work Team have learned from their own practice that Chairman Mao's direction for the arts is the only correct direction; being united with workers, peasants, and soldiers is the only correct and bright path for revolutionary artists.

Members of the Guangzhou Military Region's Sea Cultural Work Team, who have just returned from serving in the islands, excitedly said: "In the midst of the high tide of the Cultural Revolution, the re-publication of Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' has immense significance. It is a great encouragement and education for us. Our Sea Cultural Work Team has grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's great work is the sharpest weapon for defeating modern revisionism and various bourgeois artistic thoughts, and it is also the compass guiding us to thoroughly carry out the Cultural Revolution."

Since the Sea Cultural Work Team was established more than a year ago, they have gradually forged themselves into a proletarian art team with strong ideology, style, and skills by adhering to Chairman Mao's artistic direction. They have come to realize from their own practice that Chairman Mao's artistic direction is the only correct direction; deeply integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, learning from them, and achieving unity with them is the only correct and bright path for revolutionary artists. They said, "We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly eliminate the revisionist artistic black line represented by Zhou Yang, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end."

Serving the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Is the Only Correct Direction for Revolutionary Art

Members of the Sea Cultural Work Team all said that Chairman Mao pointed out as early as twenty-four years ago: "Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by them." When they joined the cultural work team and threw themselves into the fiery struggle of serving the soldiers, they deeply felt the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's instruction.

They said that more than a year ago, when the Sea Cultural Work Team was just established, many people, with the thought of seeking fame and fortune in their minds, believed that engaging in cultural work was only the task of a few, and that most people should concentrate on improving their skills and creating weighty performances; they also thought that talented performers engaging in cultural work were underutilizing their talents, and that performing small shows in units could not improve their skills, and so on. After they went deep into the units, they saw with their own eyes how the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, regarding the islands as their home, had been standing guard for the motherland and the people of the world for years and decades, defending the seas. Because they were far from cities, the soldiers had not seen any artistic performances for a long time, and when they saw the Sea Cultural Work Team, they treated the team members as family. At this time, they reread "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and revisited Chairman Mao's instruction, asking themselves a series of questions: What is the purpose of engaging in art? Is it for personal fame and fortune? Or is it to use art as a weapon to serve proletarian politics? Is it to be infatuated with performing big shows, foreign shows, and ancient shows in big cities for a few people? Or is it to go deep into the grassroots and serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers? They learned Chairman Mao's instructions over and over again, repeatedly examined their thoughts, and gradually realized that the question of who art serves and which path to take is a struggle between two classes and two lines of thought. Serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the fundamental direction of proletarian revolutionary art and the dividing line between proletarian revolutionary art and feudalist and capitalist art. Without a firm proletarian standpoint, it is impossible to adhere to the correct direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The question of serving whom is a matter of class standpoint and fundamental attitude for artists.

Five Good Member Chen Guang said that although the cultural troupe sometimes organized small performance teams to go to the units, many people went only to collect materials and experience life for their personal fame and fortune. Therefore, although they ran to many units, they did not truly act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Comparing the past with the present, they deeply felt that the change in artistic views was essentially a change in worldview. Only by overthrowing the "self" and eliminating bourgeois individualism can one adhere to the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and consciously serve them. Zhou Yang and other black gang members distorted socialist art into "art for all the people," which was a barefaced opposition to Chairman Mao's fundamental direction of art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and a revision of Chairman Mao's artistic line. We must expose their reactionary essence of revisionism.

Only by uniting with the workers, peasants, and soldiers in thought and emotion can one better serve them

Members of the Sea Cultural Work Team have realized from their own practice that the units are revolutionary furnaces, and the soldiers are the best teachers. Only in the fiery struggle of serving the soldiers can one constantly transform one's worldview, unite with the workers, peasants, and soldiers in thought and emotion, and achieve unity with them, thus better serving them. Now, they are once again studying Chairman Mao's instruction that "artists of intellectual origin must change and transform their thoughts and emotions to make their works welcome by the masses." This makes them more determined to take the path of uniting with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and to move their standpoint to the proletarian side in thought and emotion. They said that if one's thoughts and emotions are not transformed, even if one wears the clothes of workers, peasants, and soldiers, performs revolutionary plays, sings revolutionary songs, and dances revolutionary dances, the mood is still that of petty bourgeoisie and bourgeoisie. How can one talk about serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers!

Five Good Member Xu Chunmei, when she first went to the unit, felt that the soldiers had a smell of sweat. Once, she and the soldiers went to the seaside to carry sand in the wind and rain. The soldiers, carrying heavy loads up the mountain, with their clothes soaked by rain and sweat, were still laughing and singing as they ran back and forth. Xu Chunmei asked a soldier beside her, "Are you not tired?" The soldier said, "Revolution has no tiredness!" She asked again, "Why are you so happy?" The soldier said, "How can revolution not be happy!" At this time, she had a deeper understanding of these soldiers with faces tanned by the sun and bodies full of sweat. They were the most noble and pure in character and thought! As an artistic soldier, being able to serve such soldiers was the greatest honor and happiness. In the past, when she sang for the soldiers, the soldiers said her singing had a strong intellectual flavor and lacked spirit. When her thoughts and emotions changed, she sang with more strength and inspiration, inspiring people.

Graduated from the Drama Academy in 1964, Guan Jianyu, initially, due to her lack of understanding of the soldiers' sublime patriotism and internationalism, lacked fighting spirit when reciting "Fight, Heroic Brothers of South Vietnam." Although she paid attention to language techniques and body movements, she always lacked fighting passion. She lived with the soldiers in the unit for a long time, and the soldiers' revolutionary spirit of being on the islands and having a global perspective educated her. Gradually, she had common thoughts and emotions with the soldiers. When she recited the poem again, she only felt the fire burning in her chest, and her whole body was full of strength. The soldiers listened and listened, and stood up from their seats, waving their arms and shouting, "Down with American imperialism!" "Support the Vietnamese brothers!"

Long-Term, Unconditional Integration with Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, Serving Them for Life

Chairman Mao said: "Chinese revolutionary writers and artists, writers and artists with a future, must go to the masses, must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly." Members of the Sea Cultural Work Team, linking their gains from participating in the cultural work team, restudied Chairman Mao's instruction and deeply felt that to firmly establish the thought of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to constantly strengthen the thoughts and emotions of the workers, peasants, and soldiers in one's mind, the key is to firmly and unshakably carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, never to leave the fiery struggle, and never to leave the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Zhou Yang and his anti-party, anti-socialist black gang opposed art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and opposed artists integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They attempted to lead our artistic work onto the path of capitalism and revisionism. We must smash this black gang's evil plot and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life.

The experience of Five Good Member Chen Guang illustrates this point. Chen Guang joined the military cultural troupe in 1949 and served as a propagandist in a certain regiment of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. She used art as a weapon to inspire the soldiers to fight bravely, and the soldiers' great internationalism and patriotism deeply educated her. Her thoughts and emotions were closely united with those of the soldiers. Later, she became a professional dancer and stayed in big cities performing big shows for a long time, away from the fiery struggle and the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, her feelings for the soldiers became weak, and she gradually forgot the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. When she first joined the Sea Cultural Work Team, she thought about how to perform some difficult and high-skill dance programs. But she gradually found that the soldiers' reaction to these programs was very cold. She initially thought that the soldiers did not understand dance art and did not like dance. Later, she studied Chairman Mao's works with the soldiers, worked and practiced martial arts with them, and her thoughts and emotions gradually intertwined with those of the soldiers. At this time, she realized that it was not that the soldiers did not like dance, but that she had been away from the units for a long time, her thoughts and emotions had changed, and the dances she performed lacked fighting spirit and could not inspire fighting spirit. She and two other team members, Tao Hongying and Wang Zhensheng, jointly studied and compiled songs that the soldiers liked most, such as "Sailing the Sea Depends on the Helmsman," "Speak of Battle," and "I Am a Soldier," into dances. They performed in the units and were warmly welcomed by the officers and soldiers. Every time she talked about this, Chen Guang would deeply say: "Revolutionary artists cannot leave the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a moment. Leaving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is forgetting the revolution! I will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, deeply integrate with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time and unconditionally, and wholeheartedly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life!"

Treat Chairman Mao's Book as the Highest Directive, Create Socialist New Culture

The Guangzhou Military Region's Sea Cultural Work Team has long been deep in the islands, serving the soldiers. The broad masses of officers and soldiers praise them as the propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought and the red artistic cavalry. However, some bourgeois "authorities" and "experts" attacked them, saying that their performance level was low and that this was not the direction of a professional cultural troupe. Members of the Sea Cultural Work Team who adhere to Chairman Mao's artistic direction firmly and powerfully responded: Serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the most correct direction for revolutionary artists, and uniting with the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the only bright path. Leaving this direction and this path will lead to the quagmire of revisionism and capitalism.

The team members firmly said that Chairman Mao taught us that when evaluating artistic works, political standards come first, and artistic standards come second. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the true masters of culture, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the highest authorities and the best critics to judge the good and bad of artistic works. Soldiers evaluate programs first by whether they highlight politics and whether they propagate Mao Zedong Thought. This is political standards first and artistic standards second. The Sea Cultural Work Team adheres to this standard to evaluate all programs, insisting on letting the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers choose and approve. Programs that the broad masses of officers and soldiers think are good are retained, those that need to be modified are modified immediately, and those that are considered bad are firmly discarded.

Members of the Sea Cultural Work Team are thus firmly and unshakably treating Chairman Mao's great work as the highest directive, firmly carrying out and defending Chairman Mao's artistic line, and smashing the infiltration of the anti-party, anti-socialist black line in the artistic field. They said: "Mao Zedong Thought is forever the red sun in our hearts, and Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' is forever our beacon! Supporting or opposing Mao Zedong's artistic line is the dividing line between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution. Our struggle with Zhou Yang and other black gang members is a life-and-death class struggle. We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, firmly follow Chairman Mao's instructions, go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, go to the fiery struggle, actively participate in the Cultural Revolution, and together with the broad masses of workers and peasants, firmly eliminate the bourgeois, revisionist, and so-called 1930s artistic black line, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end, creating proletarian socialist new culture!"

### 毛主席的话永远是我们的指路明灯

    毛主席的话永远是我们的指路明灯
    广州部队海上文化工作队队员们从自己的实践中体会到：毛主席指出的文艺方向，是唯一正确的方向；同工农兵结合，是革命文艺工作者唯一正确的光明大道。
    刚从海岛当兵回来的广州部队海上文化工作队队员激动地说：“在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，重新发表毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，有着极为重大的意义，对我们是巨大的鼓舞和教育。我们海上文化工作队，就是在毛泽东思想的哺育下成长的。毛主席的这篇伟大著作，是战胜现代修正主义和形形色色资产阶级文艺思想的最锐利的武器，也是指导我们彻底搞好无产阶级文化大革命的指南针。”
    海上文化工作队成立一年多来，在坚持毛主席文艺方向的过程中，逐步把自己锻炼成一支思想、作风、技巧都过得硬的无产阶级文艺队伍。他们从自己亲身的实践中体会到：毛主席所指出的文艺方向，是唯一正确的方向；深入工农兵，学习工农兵，实现和工农兵相结合，是革命文艺工作者唯一正确的光明大道。他们说，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底清除以周扬为代表的修正主义文艺黑线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    为工农兵服务，是革命文艺唯一正确的方向
    海上文化工作队队员都说，毛主席早在二十四年以前就教导说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”当他们参加文化工作队，投身到为兵服务的火热斗争之后，更加深刻体会到毛主席这一指示的无比正确。
    他们说，一年多以前，海上文化工作队刚成立的时候，不少人由于脑子里装着成名成家的思想，认为搞文化工作队只是少数人的任务，多数人应该集中力量提高业务，搞有分量的大戏；又认为本领高的演员干文化工作队是大才小用，下连队演小戏，不能提高，等等。他们深入连队以后，亲眼看到广大干部、战士以岛为家，几年、十几年如一日，为祖国人民和世界人民站岗放哨，保卫海防。由于远离城镇，战士们长期看不到文艺演出，见到海上文化工作队，都把队员们当作亲人。这时，他们重新阅读《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，重温毛主席的那段教导，给自己提出了一连串的问题：搞文艺究竟是为了什么，是为个人成名成家呢，还是把文艺作为武器，为无产阶级政治服务？究竟是迷恋大城市演大戏、洋戏、古戏，为少数人服务呢，还是深入基层，为广大工农兵服务？他们一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的指示，反复检查自己的思想，逐渐认识到文艺为谁服务和走什么样道路的问题，是两个阶级、两种思想的斗争。为工农兵服务，是无产阶级革命文艺的根本方向，是无产阶级革命文艺区别于封建主义、资本主义文艺的分水岭。没有坚定的无产阶级立场，就不可能坚持文艺为工农兵服务的正确方向。为谁服务的问题，是文艺工作者的阶级立场和根本态度的问题。
    五好队员晨光说，过去文工团虽然有时也组织小型演出队下连，但是，不少人下去只是为了收集材料，体验生活，为个人成名成家捞取资本。因此，人在连队，心在城市，虽然跑了许多部队，但没有真正按照毛主席的指示去做。对比过去，深深感到文艺观的改变，实质上是世界观的改变。只有斗倒“我”字，清除资产阶级个人主义思想，才能够坚持为工农兵服务的方向，自觉地为工农兵服务。周扬等黑帮分子，把社会主义文艺歪曲为“全民文艺”，这是明目张胆地反对毛主席提出的文艺为工农兵服务的根本方向，篡改毛主席的文艺路线。我们一定要揭露他们的修正主义反动本质。
    只有思想感情和工农兵打成一片，才能更好地为工农兵服务
    海上文化工作队队员们从亲身实践中体会到：连队是革命的熔炉，战士是最好的老师，只有在为兵服务的火热斗争中，不断改造自己的世界观，在思想感情上和工农兵打成一片，和工农兵结合，才能更好地为工农兵服务。现在，他们再一次学习了毛主席关于“知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的”这一指示，使他们更加坚定了走与工农兵结合的道路，更好地从思想感情上把立脚点移到无产阶级方面来的决心。他们说，如果思想感情不来一番改造，尽管穿上工农兵衣服，演的是革命戏，唱的是革命歌，跳的是革命舞，情调还是小资产阶级、资产阶级的，怎能谈得上为工农兵服务！
    五好队员许纯梅，刚下连队的时候，和战士接触都觉得有股汗臭味。有一次她和战士一起顶风冒雨到海边挑沙子。战士们挑着重担爬大山，雨水、汗水湿透了衣服，还是有说有笑，哼着歌曲来回小跑。许纯梅就问身旁一个战士：“你累不累？”战士说：“干革命哪有不累的！”她又问：“你为啥哪么高兴呀？”战士说：“干革命怎么不高兴！”这时候，她对这些脸被阳光晒得黑黑的，满身汗味的战士有了较深的了解，他们是品质最高尚、思想最干净的人！作为一个文艺战士，能够为这样的战士服务，是最大的光荣和幸福。过去，她给战士歌唱，战士说她唱的知识分子味道浓，没有劲。当她思想感情变了，再唱起歌来就变得坚强有力，振奋人心了。
    一九六四年从戏剧学院毕业的关建宇，最初由于她对战士崇高的爱国主义、国际主义精神缺乏理解，朗诵《战斗吧，英雄的越南南方兄弟》时，尽管很注意语言技巧和形体动作，但总是缺乏战斗激情。她在连队和战士一起生活时间长了，战士们身在海岛、胸怀全球的革命精神教育了她，逐渐和战士有了共同的思想感情，再朗诵这首诗时，只觉得怒火在胸中燃烧，浑身都是力量。战士们听着，听着，从座位上站起来振臂高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“支援越南兄弟！”
    长期地无条件地深入工农兵，为工农兵服务一辈子
    毛主席说：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”。海上文化工作队队员们，联系自己参加文化工作队的收获，重新学习毛主席的这一教导，都更加深刻体会到，要牢固树立为工农兵服务的思想，不断地在自己头脑里增强工农兵的思想感情，关键在于坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的指示，永远不脱离火热的斗争，不脱离工农兵群众。周扬这伙反党反社会主义黑帮分子，反对文艺为工农兵服务，反对文艺工作者深入工农兵。妄图把我们的文艺工作带到资本主义、修正主义道路上去。我们一定要粉碎这伙黑帮的罪恶阴谋，为工农兵服务一辈子。
    五好队员晨光经历的一段曲折过程，有力地说明了这一点。晨光在一九四九年就参加部队文工队，抗美援朝战争时，在志愿军某团当宣传员。她以文艺为武器，鼓舞战士英勇战斗，战士们的伟大国际主义和爱国主义精神，又深深地教育了她，她和战士们的思想感情，紧密结合在一起。以后，她当了专业舞蹈演员，长期蹲在大城市演大戏，脱离了火热的斗争，脱离了工农兵群众，对战士的感情淡薄了，逐渐忘记了为工农兵服务的方向。刚参加海上文化工作队的时候，她心里想的是，下去怎样表演一些难度大、技巧高的舞蹈节目。可是，她渐渐发现战士们对这些节目反应很冷淡。她开始还认为是战士不懂舞蹈艺术，不喜欢舞蹈。以后，她和战士一起学习毛主席著作，一起劳动，一起练武，思想感情又逐渐与战士们交织在一起了。这时，她才知道，并不是战士不喜欢舞蹈，而是自己长期脱离连队，思想感情变了，跳的舞蹈缺乏战斗气氛，不能鼓舞斗志。她和另外两名队员陶洪英、王振生共同研究，把战士最喜欢的《大海航行靠舵手》、《说打就打》、《我是一个兵》等歌曲编成舞蹈，在连队演出，受到指战员的热烈欢迎。每当和人谈起这些，晨光就深有体会地说：“革命的文艺工作者，一时一刻也不能脱离工农兵，脱离了工农兵，就是忘记革命！我要坚决按照毛主席的教导，长期地无条件地深入到工农兵群众中去，全心全意为工农兵服务一辈子！”
    把毛主席的书当作最高指示，创造社会主义的新文化
    广州部队海上文化工作队长期深入海岛，为兵服务，广大指战员称赞他们是毛泽东思想的宣传队，是红色的文艺轻骑队。可是也有一些资产阶级“权威”、“专家”攻击他们，说他们的演出水平低，这不是专业文工团的方向。坚持毛主席文艺方向的海上文化工作队队员们坚定有力地回答：为工农兵服务是革命文艺工作者最正确的方向，同工农兵相结合是唯一的光明大道，离开这个方向和这条道路，就会陷入修正主义和资本主义的泥坑。
    队员们坚定地说，毛主席教导我们，评论文艺作品，政治标准第一，艺术标准第二。广大工农兵是文化的真正主人，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵，是鉴别文艺作品好坏的最高权威和最好的评论家。战士们评论节目，首先是看节目有没有突出政治，是不是宣传毛泽东思想。这就是政治标准第一，艺术标准第二。海上文化工作队坚持按照这个标准鉴别所有的节目，坚持让广大工农兵来选择批准。广大指战员认为好的就保留，认为要修改的立即修改，认为是不好的就坚决摒弃。
    海上文化工作队的队员们，就是这样坚定不移地把毛主席的这一伟大著作当作最高指示，坚决贯彻、捍卫了毛主席的文艺路线，粉碎了文艺界反党反社会主义黑线的侵蚀。他们说：“毛泽东思想永远是我们心中的红太阳，毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》永远是我们的指路明灯！拥护还是反对毛泽东文艺路线，是马列主义和修正主义的分界线，是革命和反革命的分界线。我们和周扬等黑帮的斗争，是你死我活的阶级斗争。我们一定要把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗高举更高举，坚定不移地遵循毛主席的教导，到工农兵中去，到火热的斗争中去，积极投入文化大革命，和广大工农群众一道，坚决搞掉资产阶级、修正主义和所谓三十年代文艺的黑线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，创造无产阶级的社会主义的新文化！”
