The *People's Army* magazine recently published an article by Longshan from South Vietnam, discussing the dry-season victories of the South Vietnamese military and people. The article states that the U.S. imperialists' dry-season plan was a strategic counteroffensive aimed at regaining the initiative on the battlefield and reversing the overall situation. However, the U.S. suffered a heavy defeat. Its military objectives were not achieved. Instead of gaining the initiative, the U.S. became even more passive. A significant portion of the U.S.-puppet forces' key combat units were eliminated, and most of their mobile units suffered heavy losses and severe depletion. Meanwhile, the South Vietnamese military and people remained vigorous, maintaining and continuing to develop their initiative on all fronts.

The article states that this is a significant victory for the South Vietnamese military and people against the U.S. imperialists' aggressive war. It is a comprehensive victory in both military and political terms.

The article emphasizes that the determination to thwart the enemy's dry-season counteroffensive is the resolve of the entire Vietnamese nation, the 31 million people of Vietnam. The Vietnamese nation is one, and the Vietnamese homeland is one. The South and the North are close kin. The U.S. imperialist aggressors are the common enemy of the entire Vietnamese people. Our strategic resolve during the dry season embodies the immense power of the entire Vietnamese nation to achieve victory.

The article states that the South Vietnamese military and people are on the front lines of the global struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression. They have fought and defeated the U.S. imperialists in both political and military terms. This demonstrates that the Vietnamese people are one of the most resolute nations in opposing imperialist aggression, a nation that has never been subdued by any enemy's threats. The South Vietnamese military and people have proven through their practical struggle against the U.S. imperialists that a united and resolute nation can defeat any imperialist aggressor, even if it is the main stronghold of international reactionary forces and the most powerful imperialist in the capitalist world.

The article states that when a nation unites into a steel-like collective in the face of aggression, when their hatred for American aggressors burns like a raging fire, and when their patriotic feelings, deeper than the East Sea, permeate every cell, the nation's power is immeasurable! The Vietnamese people, standing on the front lines against the U.S., have shown themselves to be invincible and will forever be invincible because we possess an invincible weapon: the most advanced revolutionary ideological stance, deep patriotic fervor, and a genuine internationalist position. This has become the ironclad resolve of the entire Vietnamese people to defeat the American aggressors and strive for independence, democracy, peace, and national reunification.

The article provides a detailed analysis of the situation where the U.S. aggressor forces are doomed to failure and the Vietnamese people are destined to victory. The article states that when the U.S. aggressively sent troops to the South and launched large-scale military operations, its policies, strategies, and tactics were riddled with contradictions:

The U.S. imperialists sent their expeditionary forces to massacre the Vietnamese people, exacerbating the already sharp contradictions between the U.S. and the Vietnamese nation; the contradictions between the U.S. and the puppet regime also deepened. Although the U.S. government sent a large number of troops, their mobility was still insufficient, and the contradictions between concentration and dispersion, occupation, and mobility deepened. Additionally, the U.S. military's training, organization, equipment, and tactics were mismatched, leading to crises in the implementation of strategies and tactics, and ultimately, a dead end.

The article states that by seeing through the surface to the essence, one can correctly assess the U.S. imperialists. The U.S. is strong in material and technological aspects but faces the brave and cunning Vietnamese people. Its various modern weapons and technologies cannot exert the power it imagines, thus greatly weakening this advantage. The U.S. military is politically and spiritually weak. This fundamental weakness largely dictates all its combat activities. Therefore, the aggressive and warlike demeanor is only a temporary surface phenomenon, while pessimism and wavering are the essence of the U.S. military's strategy and spirit.

The article states that it is necessary to use the correct stance and methods to examine the factors governing the military situation and forces of both sides, such as political-spiritual, strategic position, subjective guidance, armed forces, etc. In the political-spiritual aspect, we are absolutely strong due to the control of the war's purpose, while the enemy is absolutely weak. The enemy has already been defeated politically. The more we fight, the more united we become, and our morale soars, while the enemy's contradictions deepen and morale plummets. The South Vietnamese military and people's strategic position is one of victory, a proactive strategic position developing from low to high. When the U.S. military passively launched a large-scale dry-season strategic counteroffensive, the South Vietnamese military and people maintained and developed their proactive offensive, causing the enemy to suffer greater defeats and becoming more passive in military strategy. Even if the enemy sends more troops, it cannot reverse the situation and turn defeat into victory. The South Vietnamese military and people, guided by dialectical materialism and revolutionary military views, can objectively and scientifically assess the strengths of both sides in the war, leverage the superiority of people's war, overcome material shortages, turn political power into military power, and turn political advantages into military advantages. They deepen the enemy's weaknesses, making them increasingly passive. During the dry season, the South Vietnamese military and people seized the U.S. imperialists' strategic intentions and passive strategic position, proactively striking their key strategic positions, consolidating their footholds, and thwarting the enemy's various strategic counteroffensives. All the elite units of the enemy in the South Vietnamese battlefield have been hit, and almost none remain intact, making the enemy even more passive.

The article analyzes the comparison of armed forces between the enemy and us. The article states that the strength of armed forces lies not only in quantity but mainly in quality. In terms of quantity, the U.S. and puppet forces had about 700,000 during the dry season, and this number will increase in the future. However, they cannot have an absolute advantage over the South Vietnamese military and people because the South Vietnamese military and people have a rapidly growing armed force, including three types of armies, and an inexhaustible supply of reinforcements in the rear. In terms of weapons and equipment, the South Vietnamese military and people are at a disadvantage compared to the U.S. However, if we consider the main force that decides the outcome of the battlefield—infantery—then it is not the U.S. that is stronger. Moreover, under the specific war conditions in South Vietnam, we do not necessarily need to have concentrated forces equal to or close to the enemy's to form an advantage and defeat them.

The article states that through the above summary analysis and assessment, we can conclude that in the military aspect, although we are weaker in material and technology, we have many fundamental strengths; the enemy, although stronger in material and technology, has many insurmountable fundamental weaknesses. We can certainly use our strengths to attack the enemy's weaknesses, inflict heavy losses on the enemy, and gradually annihilate the enemy's important parts. Only in this way can we explain why we defeated the U.S.'s "special war" and thwarted its dry-season strategic counteroffensive, why we continued to maintain and develop our initiative, while the U.S. became increasingly passive. Only in this way can we have unwavering confidence in victory under any circumstances.

The article points out that the U.S.'s failure in the dry season is the result of a reactionary policy and erroneous strategy. This is not a phenomenon but the essence, not accidental but inevitable, not a temporary error and failure but a fundamental error and failure. Undoubtedly, these errors and failures are expanding, and the result is that the U.S. imperialists, by pursuing a neo-colonialist policy of aggressive war, are digging their own graves in South Vietnam.

The article states that why have we achieved brilliant victories and consecutively defeated the U.S. expeditionary forces' strategies and tactics? The battlefield practice has answered: based on achieving the advantage of strategic initiative and making a highly correct strategic decision, we have correct and creative command and execution in strategy and tactics. The spirit of this strategy and tactics is to force the enemy to fight according to our rules, making them weaker and weaker, and ten times weaker. The South Vietnamese military and people fight according to their own rules, making them stronger and stronger, and ten times stronger.

The article then lists several aspects of the South Vietnamese military and people's correct guidance and execution of strategy and tactics:

First, continue to use the idea of attack, resolute attack, and continuous attack, seize time, and proactively strike the enemy, making the enemy lose the initiative from the start.

Second, choose the correct direction of attack and flexible, creative, and targeted attack methods; combine military struggle with political struggle and troop supply work; coordinate various battlefields and closely coordinate the three types of armed forces, guerrilla warfare, and concentrated warfare.

Third, closely combine and promote various forms of people's war: destroy transportation, fight in the encirclement of annihilating the U.S., attack the enemy's rear bases, fight concentrated battles, making the enemy passively defend everywhere and suffer heavy losses.

Fourth, in tactics, we have made further progress in creating and using many powerful, rich, and non-monotonous tactical forms to attack and annihilate the U.S.-puppet forces. These tactical forms deeply embody the idea of annihilating the enemy's combat power, protecting and strengthening our forces, and closely combining the annihilation of the enemy, liberation of land, and winning over the people. The invincible power of these tactics is the power of revolutionary people and political-spiritual factors, combined with our other extremely fundamental strengths in the military. We vigorously develop the characteristics of mobile warfare, actively fight at night and strive to fight during the day, making close combat, direct infiltration into the enemy's ranks to split the enemy, and close combat a universal means of combat to achieve quick attacks and annihilate the enemy.

The article states that in reality, our tactics have forced the enemy to be unable to fight according to their specialized tactics, making their tactics continuously fail. These tactics make us always maintain the initiative, turning few into many, and ten times stronger, while making the enemy confused from the start, passive, turning many into few, strong into weak, and ten times weaker.

The article points out that the dry-season military victory is first and foremost the victory of our correct political line and military strategy, the victory of the art of guiding the people's war in Vietnam, and the victory of unique and creative military art. It is the result of the entire Vietnamese people's resolve, bravery, and wisdom in the fight against U.S. aggression and national salvation. It is the result of the precious support of our brothers and friends around the world.

The article states that the dry-season military victory provides us with a practical basis to once again conclude the inevitable trend of our struggle. In the future, even if the U.S. imperialists send more troops, making the U.S. and puppet forces reach one million, and use more modern weapons and technological equipment, the South Vietnamese military and people will still be able to defeat their local wars.

    长山发表文章指出：越南祖国是一个整体，美帝是越南全民族不共戴天的敌人
    越南人民彻底革命统一祖国的决心是无敌的
    旱季大捷是南方军民在军事上和政治上的全面胜利
    新华社河内六日电  越南《人民军队》杂志最近一期刊登长山从越南南方寄来的论述越南南方军民旱季胜利的第二篇文章。
    文章说，美帝国主义的旱季计划是个战略反攻计划，其目的是企图夺回战场上的主动权，扭转整个战局。然而，美国遭到了惨重失败！它的军事活动的目的没有达到。美国不仅没有取得主动，反而更加被动。美伪集团的一部分重要有生力量被消灭，它们的大部分机动单位遭到沉重打击和严重消耗。而南方军民精力充沛，保持和继续发展在各个战线上的主动地位。
    文章说，这是越南南方军民对于美帝国主义发动的侵略战争的一个重大胜利。这是在军事上和政治上的全面胜利。
    文章说，挫败敌人的旱季反攻计划的决心，是越南全民族、是越南三千一百万人民的决心。越南民族是一个整体，越南祖国是一个整体。南方和北方是亲骨肉。美帝国主义侵略者是越南全民族的不共戴天的敌人。我们在旱季中的战略性决心蕴藏着越南全民族的无比巨大的战胜力量。
    文章说，南方军民正站在世界人民反对美帝国主义侵略者的斗争的第一线上。南方军民在政治上和军事上同美帝国主义进行斗争，并且战胜了它。这表现了越南民族是一个从来都没有为敌人的任何威武所屈服的、最坚决反对帝国主义侵略者的民族之一。南方军民用自己同美帝国主义战斗并战胜它的实践活动证明：一个团结一致、坚决战斗的民族，完全可以战胜任何一个帝国主义侵略者，即使它是一个国际宪兵、国际反动势力的主要营垒、资本主义世界中最强大的帝国主义。
    文章说，当一个民族在遭受侵略的情况下团结成钢铁般的坚强集体，当他们仇恨美国强盗的烈火万丈高，当他们比东海还深的爱国情感已渗透到每个细胞的时候，这个民族的力量是无可估量的！站在反美第一线上的越南民族已经表现出是无敌的，并且永远是无敌的，因为我们拥有无敌的武器，那就是最先进的彻底革命的思想立场，就是深厚的爱国热忱和真正的国际主义的立场。它变成了越南全民决心战胜美国强盗，争取独立、民主、和平和祖国统一的钢铁决心。
    文章详细分析了美国侵略军必败和越南人民必胜的形势。文章说，当美国气势汹汹地出兵南方，疯狂地发动大规模的军事活动的时候，它的路线、政策、战略和战术矛盾百出：
    美帝国主义把它的远征军开来屠杀越南人民，使得它同越南民族之间已经尖锐的矛盾变得更加尖锐；美伪之间的矛盾也日益深化；美国政府虽然开来了大批军队，但机动力量仍然不足，集中与分散、占地与机动之间的矛盾日益加深，再加上美国军队的建军、组织、装备和训练是一套，但打的却是另一套，因此，它正遇到战略与战术之间、战术与技术之间、主观愿望与战场实践之间的矛盾，等等，从而导致在指导和执行战略、战术等方面的危机，并且走投无路。
    文章说，透过现象看到本质，才能正确地估价美帝国主义。美国在物质和技术方面强，但却要对付勇敢和机智的越南人民，它的各种现代化武器和技术并不能够发挥它所想象的威力，因此它的这一长处被大大地削弱了。美军在政治和精神上非常虚弱。这个根本弱点在很大程度上支配了它的一切战斗活动。因此，来势汹汹、疯狂好战，只不过是一时的表面现象，而悲观、动摇，才是美军的战略和精神的实质。
    文章说，必须运用正确的立场和方法来考察支配着敌我双方的军事形势和军事力量的一些因素，诸如政治—精神、战略地位、主观指导、武装力量，等等。在政治—精神方面，由于战争目的的支配，我们绝对的强，敌人绝对的弱。敌人在政治上已经被打败。我们越打越团结一致，斗志越昂扬，敌人越打矛盾越深，士气越低落；南方军民的战略地位是胜利的战略地位，是从低发展到高的主动战略地位。当美军被动地大规模开进来实行旱季战略反攻计划的时候，南方军民保持和发展主动的进攻，使敌人遭受更大的失败，在军事战略上更加被动挨打，即使敌人再增派多少军队也无法扭转战局，转败为胜；南方军民由于有辩证唯物主义的世界观和革命的军事观点，在指导战争中能够客观地、科学地估计敌我双方力量，能够发挥人民战争的优越性，能够克服在物质方面的短缺，把政治力量变成军事力量，把政治优势变成军事优势，加深敌人的弱点，使它们陷于日益被动的处境。在旱季，南方军民紧紧地抓住美帝国主义的战略意图和战略上的被动地位，主动地直捣它们的重要战略地盘，巩固自己的立脚点，粉碎敌人的各次战略反攻。敌人在南方战场上的所有精锐兵团都挨了打，几乎没有一个兵团还保持完整，使得敌人更加深陷被动的地位。
    文章对敌我双方武装力量的对比作了分析。文章说，武装力量的强大不仅仅在于数量，而主要在于质量。从数量来说，美军和伪军在旱季中约有七十万左右，今后还会增加，但也不能占有压倒南方军民的绝对优势，因为南方军民拥有飞跃壮大中的、包括三种军队的武装力量，拥有在后方取之不尽的补充力量。在武器装备方面，南方军民同美国比是居于劣势。但是如果单就决定战场胜负的主要力量——步兵来考察，那就不是美国比我们强。而且，在越南南方的具体战争条件下，我们不一定要有同敌人接近或相等的集中兵力才能够形成优势，才能够战胜它们。
    文章说，通过对上述的概括分析和估计，我们可以得出这样的结论：在军事方面，我们虽然物质、技术较弱，但是却有着许多最根本的长处；敌人虽然物质、技术较强，但是却有着许多无法克服的最根本的弱点。我们完全有可能以己之长，攻敌之短，大量消耗敌人，并把敌军的重要部分逐个地予以全歼。只有这样肯定了，才能够解释为什么我们打败了美国的“特种战争”，粉碎了它的旱季战略反攻计划，为什么我们继续保持和发展了主动地位，而美国却日益深陷被动地位。只有这样肯定了，才能够在不论任何局势下都有坚定的必胜信心。
    文章指出，美国在旱季中的失败是一种反动政策和错误战略的后果。这不是现象而是本质，不是偶然而是必然，不是暂时的错误和失败而是根本的错误和失败。毫无疑问，这些错误和失败正在扩大，其结果是，美帝国主义由于推行新殖民主义侵略战争政策，正在越南南方挖掘着埋葬自己的坟墓。
    文章说，为什么我们取得了辉煌胜利，接连打败了美国远征军的战略战术呢？战场上的实践已经回答：在取得战略主动的优势和下定高度的正确的战略决心的基础上，我们在战略战术上有着正确和创造性的指挥和执行。这种战略战术的精神是，迫使敌人按照我们规定的打法来打，使它们由多变少，由强变弱，变成十倍虚弱。南方军民按照自己的打法来打，这种打法使我们由少变多，由弱变强，变成十倍强大。
    文章接着举出南方军民正确地指导和执行战略战术的几个方面：
    第一、继续运用进攻、坚决进攻和连续进攻的思想，争取时间，主动抢先打击敌人，使敌人一开始就失掉主动。
    第二、选择正确的进攻方向以及灵活的、富有创造性的和针对对方的进攻方法；把军事斗争同政治斗争和兵运工作结合起来；各战场协调地配合，三种武装力量紧密配合，游击战和集中作战紧密配合。
    第三、紧密结合和促进人民战争的各种作战方式：破坏交通，在歼美包围圈中打，打敌人后方基地，打集中战，使敌人到处被动招架，遭受惨重损失。
    第四、在战术上，我们在创造和运用许多最厉害的、丰富的和不单调的战术形式方面又前进了一步，以攻打和歼灭美伪军。这些战术形式深刻贯穿着消灭敌人有生力量、保卫和壮大我们的力量的思想，把消灭敌人、解放土地和争取人民这几方面十分紧密地结合起来。这些战术的无敌力量就是革命的人的因素和政治—精神因素的力量，加上我们在军事上的其他极根本的长处。我们在战术上大力发挥打运动战的特长，积极打夜战和争取打日战，把美军最害怕的打近战、直插入敌阵分割敌人和打白刃战作为普遍的战斗手段，以便实现快攻，全歼敌人。
    文章说，实际上，我们的战术已迫使敌人无法根据它们的专长战术来战斗，使得它们的战术接连遭到破产。这种战术使我们时刻保持主动权，少而变多，变成十倍强大，而使敌人自始至终不知所措，陷于被动，多却变少，强却变弱，变成十倍虚弱。
    文章指出，旱季军事胜利首先是我们正确的政治路线和军事战略的胜利，是越南人民战争的指导艺术的胜利，是独特的和创造的军事艺术的胜利。它是我国全军全民抗美救国战斗决心、英勇战斗精神和智慧的结果。它是我们在世界上的兄弟和朋友的宝贵支援的结果。
    文章说，旱季军事胜利给我们提供了实际基础，以便再次对我们的战斗的必然趋向作出结论，今后，即使美帝国主义再增兵，使美军和伪军达到一百万名，并使用更多的现代化武器和技术装备，越南南方军民还是必定能够打败它们的局部战争的。
