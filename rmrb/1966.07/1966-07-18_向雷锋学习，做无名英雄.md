	*Editor’s Note from the Liberation Army Daily*: Comrade Liu Yingjun did many good deeds in his short life that benefited the masses and the collective of the unit.

	Comrade Liu Yingjun did good deeds without ever seeking personal recognition. He dedicated his entire energy to the revolution and the people with sincerity and selflessness.

	Doing good deeds is a revolutionary practice, it is putting Chairman Mao's teachings into action, and it is consciously and unconditionally executing the highest directives. Comrade Liu Yingjun once said: "Only those who dedicate everything to the revolution are true human beings. Whether I can become such a person remains to be tested in practice. I truly understand that 'practice is the sole criterion for testing truth,' and I will be tested by practice." He followed Chairman Mao's teachings, gradually raised his proletarian consciousness, and established a communist worldview through concrete practice in serving the people.

	The counter-revolutionary Deng Tuo, in the opening of his "Yanshan Black Speech," raised the issue of "one-third of life," advocating for people to pursue personal fame and gain, and promoting a bourgeois lifestyle and worldview. In contrast, Comrade Liu Yingjun dedicated his entire life to serving the people. Most of the good deeds he did were in his spare time, which is what Deng Tuo and his ilk call "one-third of life." For us proletarian revolutionaries, we must revolutionize during work hours and also during spare time. There is no time that is not for the revolution, no time that is not for the people.

	Comrade Liu Yingjun once said: "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai, and to live for the people's interests is also heavier than Mount Tai." This statement is very appropriate in evaluating Comrade Liu Yingjun himself. He sacrificed his life to protect the people's lives, and his death is heavier than Mount Tai; he dedicated his entire time and energy to the people, and his life is also heavier than Mount Tai.

	We should follow Comrade Liu Yingjun's example, adhere to Chairman Mao's teachings, dare to practice, temper ourselves, love the people, and sincerely serve the people, dedicating ourselves wholeheartedly until our last breath.

	This child, Yingjun, not only sacrificed his life to save a child in a critical moment but also, in his daily life, always had the people in his heart and none of himself.

	In the depths of winter, the water well in our neighborhood committee had frozen into a small "ice mountain," making it inconvenient for everyone to draw water. One Sunday morning, around eight o'clock, I was sitting in the house when I saw a soldier standing outside. I went out and asked, "Comrade, what can I do for you?" He said, "Auntie, I want to borrow a pickaxe and a shovel to dig up the ice around the well!" I lent him the pickaxe and shovel, and he took off his coat and started working. After a while, I went out to check and saw that his small white shirt was soaked with sweat. I said, "Look at this child, studying Chairman Mao's works has truly armed his mind, working so hard!" I put the coat on him and said, "It's not far, you should go back and rest!" He didn't rest but borrowed a basket from me to move the ice to the ditch, working until eleven o'clock before going back.

	He used his rest time to dig several times before finally removing the "ice mountain," making the well area flat and neat, and even added sand. I asked him his surname, and he laughed and said, "Auntie, I am surnamed Wang." Then he turned and left.

	One day, it happened that my child was at home. I saw him come again, so I said, "Fuzhi, go out and see if Comrade Wang is borrowing a pickaxe or a shovel." My child looked and said, "Mom, that's not my Liu brother! He is Liu Yingjun!" I said, "How do you know him?" He said, "We played ball together!" I said, "Then quickly invite your Liu brother in!" He came in, and I said, "Hey! Why did you deceive Auntie? You learn from Lei Feng, learn from Wang Jie, do good deeds, and be an unnamed hero! If it weren't for your little brother being at home, I would still think you really have the surname Wang!" Yingjun, this child, truly has Chairman Mao's thoughts in his mind and carved in his heart! The good deeds he has done are truly too many! Last winter, I went to the grain shop to buy grain. As soon as I topped the grain on my head and walked out of the shop door, someone took the grain from behind me. I turned around and saw it was Yingjun. I said, "Child, where did you come from?" He said, "I also came to buy things. I'll take the flour and send it back to your home!" I said, "You're carrying something heavy!" He said, "Aren't you also carrying something heavy?" He insisted on helping me carry the grain back home. As he was leaving, I said, "Go back and read more of Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words!" He said, "Auntie, don't worry, I will definitely not forget Chairman Mao's words!"

	Liu Yingjun saved the second generation, and his heroic deeds also educated the second generation. My home is a nursery, and whenever I have time, I tell the children about Liu Yingjun's deeds. I asked the children, "Uncle Liu sacrificed for whom?" The children said, "For all of us." I said, "How will you learn from him?" The children said, "We will listen to Chairman Mao's words like Uncle Liu!" Some children said, "Don't look down on us because we are small. When we grow up, we will also join the PLA and fight the American devils!"

### 向雷锋学习，做无名英雄

专栏：

    《解放军报》编者按：刘英俊同志在短短的一生中，做了很多很多有益于人民群众，有益于连队集体的好事。
    刘英俊同志做好事，从来没有一点显示自己的意思。他一心为公，诚心诚意地把自己的全部精力贡献给革命，贡献给人民。
    做好事就是革命的实践，就是学了毛主席著作在“用”字上狠下功夫，就是自觉地、无条件地执行最高指示。刘英俊同志说过：“为革命贡献自己一切的人，才算是一个真正的人。我能否成为这样的人，还有待于实践。我确实深深体会到，‘实践是检验真理的试金石’，我将受实践的考验。”他就是遵照毛主席的教导，在为人民服务的具体实践中，逐步地提高了无产阶级觉悟，树立了共产主义世界观。
    反革命分子邓拓，在他的“燕山黑话”的开篇里，提出什么“生命的三分之一”的问题，鼓吹人们追求个人名利，追求资产阶级生活方式，推销资产阶级世界观。和资产阶级的世界观相反，刘英俊同志把全部生命，投入到为人民服务中去。他所做的好事，大都是在业余时间，即邓拓之流所谓“生命的三分之一”的时间里做的。对于我们无产阶级革命者来说，工作时间要革命，业余时间也要革命。无时不是为革命，无时不是为人民。
    刘英俊同志说过：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重，为人民利益而活着的人，也比那泰山还重。”我们用这句话来评价刘英俊同志自己是十分恰当的。他为保护人民生命而英勇献身，他的死比泰山还重；他一心为公，把全部时间、全部精力贡献给人民，他活着的时候，也比那泰山还重。
    我们应该象刘英俊同志那样，遵照毛主席的教导，勇于到实践中去锻炼，去改造，热爱人民，真诚地为人民服务，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。
　　向雷锋学习，做无名英雄
　　李桂英
    英俊这孩子，不但在紧要关头，能够舍了生命救孩子，就是在平时，他心里也只有人民，没有自己。
    数九寒冬，我们居民委员会的水井边冻出了一个小“冰山”，大家打水挺不方便。一个星期天的早晨，八点多钟，我正在屋里坐着，看见一个战士站在门外。我走出去问：“同志，有什么事吗？”他说：“大娘，我想借个镐，借把锹，把那个井刨一刨！”我把镐、锹借给他，他把棉衣脱下，就干了起来。过了一会儿，我出去一看，他那小白布衫被汗水湿得透透的。我说：“你瞅，这孩子学习毛主席著作真是武装了头脑，这活干得多猛呀！”我把棉衣给他披上，说：“不大离，你就回去休息休息吧！”他不休息，又跟我借了土筐，把刨下来的冰弄到壕沟里去，一直干到十一点多钟才回去。
    他一连利用休息时间刨了几次，才把那座“冰山”搬倒，把水井旁修得平平整整的，还给垫上了砂子。我问他姓啥？他笑呵呵地说：“大娘，我姓王。”转身就走了。
    有一天，正赶上我的孩子在家，我看他又来了，我说：“福子，你出去看看王同志是借镐，还是借锹？”我孩子一瞅，歪着头对我说：“妈，那不是我刘哥哥吗？他叫刘英俊呀！”我说：“你怎么认识？”他说：“我们在一起打过球嘛！”我说：“那你赶快请你刘哥哥进来！”他一进屋，我就说：“咳！你怎么诓大娘呢？你跟雷锋学，跟王杰学，净做好事，当无名的英雄！要不是你小弟弟在家，我还以为你真姓王呢！”
    英俊这孩子，真是把毛泽东思想都记在脑子里，刻在心上啦！他做的好事实在太多了！头年腊月，我去粮店买粮，刚把粮食顶在脑袋上走出店门，就有人从后边把粮食拿过去了。我回头一瞅，是英俊。我说：“孩子，你从哪儿来？”他说：“我也是买东西来了，我把面给你老人家送回去吧！”我说：“你拿着挺沉的！”他说：“你拿着不是也沉吗？”硬是帮助我把粮食送到了家。临走时，我说：“回去要多读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话！”他说：“大娘，你放心吧，毛主席的话我坚决不能忘！”
    刘英俊救了第二代，他的英雄行为也教育了第二代。我家是托儿站，我一有空就给孩子们讲刘英俊的事。我问孩子们：“刘叔叔是为谁牺牲的？”孩子们说：“是为我们大伙。”我说：“你们怎么向他学习？”孩子们说：“我们要象刘叔叔那样，听毛主席的话！”有的小孩说：“你别看我们小，我们长大了也去当解放军，打美国鬼子！”
