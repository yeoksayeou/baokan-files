Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is a landmark document of great significance. It is a powerful weapon for defeating bourgeois, revisionist, and all kinds of reactionary literary and artistic thought. We workers, peasants, and soldiers have an infinite love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao's works. With "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as our mirror, we can expose any demon or ghost, no matter where it hides, and drag it out into the open!

With this weapon, we workers, peasants, and soldiers have driven out the "emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties" who have long dominated the literary and artistic stage. Their thrones have been smashed to pieces! We are deeply grateful to Chairman Mao, who has enabled us workers and soldiers to hold our heads high and allowed our heroic images to take the stage, truly becoming the masters of the stage.

Every word in Chairman Mao's "Talks" is the truth, striking at the heart of the working class. However, a small clique of anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought elements in the literary and artistic circles, led by Zhou Yang, are terrified of this "Talks." They fiercely oppose it. While advocating "literature and art for the whole people," Zhou Yang also claims that Chairman Mao's "Talks" is outdated, absurdly saying that "the situation is different now from the time of the Yan'an Forum." Their goal is to erase the historical significance of Chairman Mao's "Talks." Zhou Yang's words are no different from Khrushchev's slander that "Marxism-Leninism is outdated"—they are barking at the sun!

Chairman Mao teaches us that to overthrow a regime, one must first seize the superstructure, first seize the ideology, and prepare public opinion. This is true for the revolutionary class and also for the counter-revolutionary class.

Since liberation, the bourgeois literary and artistic black line, represented by Zhou Yang, has launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. Isn't this an attempt to first prepare public opinion and then realize the dream of restoring capitalism? If so, we, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, must be a hundred times more vigilant. We must not think that "scholars rebelling takes three years to succeed" and that a few literati fighting with pens and ink is of little consequence. We must actively participate in the current Cultural Revolution, engage in a head-on struggle against all anti-party and anti-socialist demons and ghosts, and fight them down, fight them to the stench, and fight them to ruin. We must resolutely defend Mao Zedong Thought and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is the compass and battle cry of the Cultural Revolution. It is also the mirror that exposes all demons and ghosts. We workers, peasants, and soldiers are thrilled and deeply moved by the re-publication of this "Talks." Imperialists, reactionaries, revisionists, and all demons and ghosts, however, are trembling with fear and anxiety. Let them curse and shiver! We will study this "Talks" a thousand times, ten thousand times, better learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We will carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

　　粉碎他们复辟资本主义的美梦
　　北京印染厂工人　袁永庆　赵金桢
    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，是一部划时代的重要文献，是战胜资产阶级、修正主义及形形色色反动的文艺思想的强大武器。我们工农兵群众对毛主席的著作无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜。有了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这一照妖镜，什么牛鬼蛇神也逃不出我们的眼睛，不管它藏在哪里，我们也能把它揪出来！
    我们工农兵群众用《讲话》这一武器，把多少年来一直霸占文艺舞台的“帝王将相、才子佳人”统统给赶跑了。他们的宝座被我们砸了个粉碎！我们万分感激毛主席，是毛主席让我们工农兵扬眉吐气，让我们的英雄形象登上舞台，真正成了舞台上的主人。
    毛主席的《讲话》，句句是真理，句句都说到了我们工人阶级的心窝上。而文艺界以周扬为首的一小撮反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮，却对毛主席的这篇《讲话》怕得要死，他们拚命地反对《讲话》。周扬在鼓吹“全民文艺”的同时，还扬言毛主席的《讲话》已经过时，胡说什么现在“和延安座谈会时不同”了，其目的就是企图抹煞毛主席的《讲话》的历史意义。周扬这番话，完全同赫鲁晓夫污蔑“马列主义已经过时”一样，是狂犬吠日！
    毛主席教导我们，要推翻一个政权，必须先抓上层建筑，先抓意识形态，作好舆论准备，革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。
    解放以来，以周扬为代表的资产阶级文艺黑线向党、向社会主义发动的猖狂进攻，不正是企图先作好舆论准备，然后实现复辟资本主义的美梦吗？既然是这样，我们广大工农兵群众就必须百倍地提高警惕，不要以为“秀才造反，三年不成”，几个文人“打笔墨官司，无足轻重”，而一定要积极投入当前的文化大革命运动，对一切反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神进行针锋相对的斗争，把它们斗倒，斗臭，斗垮，以坚决捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫无产阶级专政。
    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是无产阶级文化大革命的指南针和进军号，也是无产阶级横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的照妖镜。我们工农兵群众对这一讲话的重新发表，感到欢欣鼓舞，万分亲切；而帝国主义、反动派、修正主义，以及一切牛鬼蛇神却感到心惊肉跳、坐卧不安，那就让他们在那里咒骂吧，发抖吧！我们一定要一千遍一万遍地学习这一篇讲话，更好地活学活用毛主席的一切著作，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
