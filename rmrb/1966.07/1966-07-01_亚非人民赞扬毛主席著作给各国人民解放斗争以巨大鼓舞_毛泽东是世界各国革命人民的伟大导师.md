	Asian and African peoples warmly praise Chairman Mao Zedong as the great teacher of the revolutionary peoples of the whole world, and point out that Chairman Mao Zedong's works have brought great encouragement to the peoples who are struggling for independence, freedom, and liberation.

	A teacher in Lahore, Pakistan, said: "I admire Mao Zedong because Chairman Mao Zedong has led 650 million Chinese people to create miracles in building their own country. Mao Zedong guides and inspires the broad masses of the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to break free from imperialist rule. Mao Zedong is the greatest revolutionary of our time."

	A lawyer in Rawalpindi said: "Mao Zedong is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the peoples of the whole world. Mao Zedong's works have brought great encouragement to the peoples who are struggling for independence, freedom, and liberation."

	The people of Pakistan express their gratitude to Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese people for supporting the Pakistani people in their resistance against Indian aggression and the struggle of the Kashmiri people for the right to self-determination. A young pilot at an airbase in Sargodha, West Pakistan, enthusiastically told a reporter: "Please convey my respects to Mao Zedong. You have helped us in our difficult times. The Chinese people under the leadership of Mao Zedong shine brightly in our hearts. We will never forget it."

	On the 28th, the director of the Syrian Arab East News Agency, Fazi Alraf, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "Chairman Mao is undoubtedly the greatest world leader."

	He said that Chairman Mao Zedong led the Chinese people to victory. "He taught the Chinese people that whether in work or in battle, it is not only for China but also for the peoples of the world." When talking about his impressions of his visit to China, he said, "I saw the great achievements China has made in all aspects, and these great achievements reflect the power of Mao Zedong Thought. Wherever Mao Zedong Thought is grasped, there is victory. China's achievements are inseparable from the leadership of Chairman Mao."

	He said that it should be mentioned that he found that many Syrian intellectuals are studying Chairman Mao's works. He believes that Chairman Mao's works should be published in various languages to meet the needs of the peoples of the world, so that the torch of Mao Zedong Thought can illuminate all dark corners and let the peoples of all countries know how to serve the people and how to win victory.

	The people of Mali respect and love Chairman Mao Zedong and love his works.

	A Malian worker named Musa said: "After reading Mao Zedong's works, I think Mao Zedong is very concerned about the poor people. He is dedicated to the liberation of the poor people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. After reading Mao Zedong's books, I am willing to devote myself to my country." A technician said: "Chairman Mao works not only for the happiness of the Chinese people but also for the happiness of the African people. His works inspire the Chinese people and the peoples of the world who are struggling against imperialism and for liberation."

	An engineer said: "After reading Chairman Mao's works, I deeply understand that Chairman Mao is not only the great teacher of the Chinese people but also the great teacher of the revolutionary peoples of various countries. His works are closely linked to reality and are easy to understand."

	A workshop supervisor at a Malian factory said: "Chairman Mao is not only the great revolutionary leader of the Chinese people but also the great revolutionary leader of the peoples of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is not only the guide for the Chinese people but also the guide for the peoples of the world." He also said: "Chairman Mao's works have given me strength and courage.
