	Niger's representative, Sully Amadou, said at the general meeting of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers held today that the disastrous defeat suffered by American imperialism in its special warfare in South Vietnam has proven that, as Chairman Mao Zedong said, "a people, no matter how small, when they are united and fight for their liberation, are invincible."

	He said, "At this crucial moment in the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, some people advocate 'peaceful coexistence' between the oppressors and the oppressed, and encourage people to believe in and support the so-called 'peace talks' of American imperialism." He refuted this, saying, "We cannot make any concessions to those who try to induce us to mortgage our national liberation."

	He said, "The revolutionary writers of Niger unreservedly support the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. He called on Asian, African, and Latin American revolutionary writers and all anti-imperialist writers in the world to contribute to supporting the glorious Vietnamese people."

	He exposed the cultural aggression of imperialism against Asian and African countries. He said, "Asia and Africa should be the center of the world cultural revolution. No one can stop the historical wheels of these two continents from moving forward."

	In the final part of his speech, he quoted a passage from Chairman Mao Zedong, hoping that writers would go to the masses, live with the masses, learn from the masses, and serve the masses.

    尼日尔代表阿马杜的发言
    新华社二日讯　尼日尔代表苏利·阿马杜在亚非作家紧急会议今天举行的全体会议上说，美帝国主义在南越所进行的特种战争遭到的惨败，证实了毛泽东主席所说的，一个国家的人民，不论多少，一旦团结起来进行人民解放的正义斗争，就是不可战胜的。
    他说，在越南人民进行抗美救国斗争的决定性时刻，有人却鼓吹压迫者与被压迫者之间实行“和平共处”，要人们相信和鼓励美帝国主义的所谓“和平谈判”。他驳斥说，对那种要诱使我们把我们的民族解放抵押出去的人，我们不能作任何让步。
    他说，尼日尔的革命作家无保留地支持越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，他号召亚非拉的革命作家和所有世界上反帝的作家为声援光荣的越南人民而作出自己的贡献。
    他揭露了帝国主义对亚非国家进行的文化侵略。他说，亚洲非洲应该作为世界文化革命风暴的中心。没有任何人能够制止我们两大洲的历史车轮前进。
    他在发言的最后部分，引用了毛泽东主席的一段话，希望作家到群众中去，跟群众一起生活，向群众学习，为群众服务。
