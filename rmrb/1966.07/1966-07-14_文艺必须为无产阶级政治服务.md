Just as we, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, are sweeping away all ghosts and monsters with the force of a thunderbolt, the republication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has greatly encouraged us. This great, brilliant, and luminous work by Chairman Mao has developed and established a complete, thorough, and correct Marxist-Leninist literary line. It vividly embodies the class interests of the proletariat and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. For this reason, those with ulterior motives who are anti-party and anti-socialist always try every means to resist the "Talks," distorting the Marxist-Leninist literary line established by Chairman Mao, attempting to make us deviate from the path of Mao Zedong Thought, deviate from the path of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and deviate from the path of serving proletarian politics. This is absolutely unacceptable. Our literary creation must be based on the needs of the Party and the revolution, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving proletarian politics, serving socialism, and serving the three great revolutionary movements.

Our amateur literary troupe in the locomotive depot has grown and flourished under the leadership of the Party and nourished by Mao Zedong Thought, following the correct line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Over the past few years, by adhering to Chairman Mao's teachings and implementing the policy of literature serving proletarian politics, we have closely followed the central revolutionary tasks of each period, creating and performing a large number of literary works. These works truly reflect the great achievements of socialist revolution and socialist construction, praising the heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and have powerfully promoted the three great revolutionary movements, receiving the enthusiastic support and warm welcome of the broad masses of workers.

Regarding the great Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies, we have unwavering faith. In propaganda, we strive to be in sync and in harmony.

During the three years of difficulty, the Party called on us to be self-reliant, strive for strength, work hard, and build the country with thrift. Our workers' amateur creation group promptly created a batch of plays, poems, and performance materials. The workers said after watching them, "These little performances really quench our thirst, and after watching them, we gain strength."

The Party called on us to increase production and save resources, opposing waste. We wrote poems, quick-talk, and plays based on the workers' thrifty deeds. The workers felt that saving a bit of oil, a piece of coal, a screw... is contributing to the socialist revolution and socialist construction, establishing the noble ethos of thrift as honor and waste as shame.

Since the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued the call to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, our amateur writers have stepped forward, standing at the forefront of the cultural revolution, sweeping away all ghosts and monsters. We wrote more than 2,000 articles criticizing the anti-party, anti-socialist clique; a large number of poems praising the Party and Chairman Mao, plays and revolutionary stories praising the revolutionary spirit of the working class, and various forms of works, greatly boosting the revolutionary spirit of the working class and greatly dampening the arrogance of the bourgeois "experts" and "scholars." The workers enthusiastically praised these works as the flowers of the cultural revolution. They encouraged their amateur writers, saying, "You dare to do it! Write a lot! As long as it is good for socialism, we workers will love to read, sing, listen to, and watch it. We workers will consider it a good work." Those so-called "limiting the scope of literary themes, affecting the multi-faceted development of artistic creation," and "making the literary path very narrow, the quality of the works very low" are all revisionist fallacies.

In the practice of class struggle, we deeply feel that creating for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving proletarian politics, serving socialist revolution and socialist construction, the path of creation is broader, the themes are richer, the quality is higher, the combat effectiveness is stronger, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers welcome it more.

### 文艺必须为无产阶级政治服务

　　文艺必须为无产阶级政治服务
　　天津机务段工人　徐树德
    正当我们广大工农兵以雷霆万钧之力，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的时候，重新发表毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，给了我们极大的鼓舞。毛主席这一伟大、天才、光辉的著作，发展和创立了一条最完整、最彻底、最正确的马克思列宁主义的文艺路线。它鲜明地体现了无产阶级的阶级利益和广大工农兵群众的根本利益。正因为这样，那些别有用心的反党反社会主义的家伙们，总是千方百计抵制《讲话》，篡改毛主席创立的这条马克思列宁主义文艺路线，企图让我们离开毛泽东思想的轨道，离开为工农兵服务的轨道，离开为无产阶级政治服务的轨道。这是万万办不到的。我们搞文艺创作就是要根据党的需要，革命的需要，为工农兵而创作，为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义服务，为三大革命运动服务。
    我们机务段的工人业余文艺队伍，就是在党的领导下，在毛泽东思想哺育下，沿着为工农兵服务的正确路线，日益成长壮大起来的。几年来，由于我们按照毛主席的教导，坚持贯彻文艺为无产阶级政治服务的方针，紧跟每个时期的革命中心任务，创作和演出了大量的文艺作品。这些作品，真实地反映了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大业绩，歌颂了用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物，有力地促进了三大革命运动，受到了广大职工的热情支持和热烈欢迎。
    对于伟大的毛泽东思想，对于党的方针政策，我们坚信不疑，在宣传上，我们力求做到紧跟、合拍。
    在三年困难时期，党号召我们自力更生，奋发图强，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国。我们工人业余创作组就及时地创作了一批话剧、诗歌和演唱材料。工人们看了以后说：“这些小节目真解渴，看了以后就长劲。”
    党号召我们增产节约，反对浪费。我们就根据工人们勤俭节约的事迹写了一些诗歌、快板和戏。工人们看了以后，都感到节约一点油，一块煤，一个螺丝钉……就是为社会主义革命和社会主义建设贡献一份力量，树立了节约为荣、浪费为耻的崇高风尚。
    自从党中央和毛主席发出把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的号召以后，我们业余作者就挺身而出，站在文化大革命前列，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。我们写了两千多篇批判反党反社会主义黑帮的文章；写了大量的歌颂党、歌颂毛主席的诗歌，歌颂工人阶级革命豪情的话剧、革命故事等各种形式的作品，大长工人阶级的革命志气，大灭资产阶级“专家”“学者”的威风。职工们热情地赞扬这些作品是文化革命之花。他们鼓励自己的业余作者说：“你们大胆干吧！大量写吧！只要对社会主义有好处的，我们工人就爱读、爱唱、爱听、爱看。我们工人就认为那是好作品。”那些所谓“写中心限制文艺的题材范围，影响艺术创作的多方面发展”，会“把文艺路子搞得很窄，作品质量很低”等说法，统统是修正主义的谬论。
    我们在阶级斗争的实践中搞业余创作深刻体会到：为工农兵而创作，为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，创作的路子就越广，题材就越丰富，质量就越高，战斗力就越强，工农兵就越欢迎。
