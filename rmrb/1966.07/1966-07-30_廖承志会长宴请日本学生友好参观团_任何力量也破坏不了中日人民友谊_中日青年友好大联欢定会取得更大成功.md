Chairman Liao Chengzhi Hosts Banquet for Japanese Student Friendship Visiting Group

Any Force Cannot Destroy Sino-Japanese Friendship

The Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival Will Surely Achieve Greater Success

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the 29th, Chairman Liao Chengzhi of the China-Japan Friendship Association hosted a banquet to warmly welcome the Japanese Student Friendship Visiting Group led by Ohyama Seiya.

Liao Chengzhi, Ohyama Seiya, and Vice Chairman Qian Dawen of the All-China Youth Federation all spoke at the banquet, wishing for the friendship between the peoples and youth of China and Japan to last for generations.

Liao Chengzhi said, we welcome more and more Japanese friends to visit China. We hope that this year, more Japanese youth will come to our country to participate in the second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. We are confident that this year's festival will achieve even greater success. Liao Chengzhi said, the friendship between the peoples and youth of China and Japan cannot be destroyed by any force. Anyone who tries to destroy the friendship between the peoples and youth of China and Japan is our common enemy.

Ohyama Seiya said, we have come to China and seen the power of friendship between the peoples and youth of China and Japan. He promised that Japanese youth will continue to work for the development of friendship between the peoples and youth of China and Japan and for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

Qian Dawen said, the upcoming second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival is in line with the common wishes of the peoples and youth of China and Japan to unite and oppose U.S. imperialism. A small anti-current against the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival absolutely cannot obstruct the development of friendship between the youth of China and Japan. He said, Chinese youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought will forever be loyal to the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship. In the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and accomplices, we will forever stand with the people and youth of Japan. The banquet was filled with a warm atmosphere of friendship and joy. The youth of both countries performed songs and dances. In the end, they also joined hands and sang "Tokyo-Beijing" together.

Also present at the banquet with the Japanese friends were relevant officials Zhao Anbo, Wang Xiaoyun, Wan Fu, and Wu Shaozu.

Japanese peace activist Nishisonji Koji and other Japanese friends in Beijing were also invited to the banquet.

The Japanese Student Friendship Visiting Group, consisting of 118 people, arrived in Beijing this morning. They were warmly welcomed by the capital's youth and students, as well as relevant officials at the Beijing Railway Station.

    廖承志会长宴请日本学生友好参观团
    任何力量也破坏不了中日人民友谊
    中日青年友好大联欢定会取得更大成功
    据新华社二十九日讯  中国日本友好协会会长廖承志今晚举行酒会，热烈欢迎以大山圣也为首的日本学生友好参观团。
    廖承志、大山圣也和中华全国青年联合会副主席钱大卫先后在酒会上讲话，祝中日两国人民和青年世世代代友好下去。
    廖承志说，我们欢迎越来越多的日本朋友来中国访问，希望今年有更多的日本青年朋友来我国参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢，相信今年的大联欢一定会取得更大的成功。廖承志说，中日两国人民和青年的友谊是任何力量也破坏不了的，谁想破坏中日两国人民和青年的友谊，谁就是我们的共同敌人。
    大山圣也说，我们来到中国，看到了中日两国人民和青年之间友谊的力量。他保证，日本青年将继续为发展日中两国人民和青年的友谊，为恢复日中邦交而努力。
    钱大卫说，将要举行的第二届中日青年友好大联欢，是符合中日两国人民和青年团结起来反对美帝国主义的共同愿望的。一小股反对中日青年友好大联欢的逆流，绝对阻挡不了中日两国青年友谊的发展。他说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国青年，永远忠于中日友好事业，在反对美帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶的斗争中，我们永远同日本人民和青年在一起。酒会上，中日两国青年沉浸在一片友谊和欢乐的气氛中。两国青年表演了歌舞节目。最后，他们还手挽手同声高唱《东京—北京》。
    今晚同日本朋友欢聚的，还有各有关方面负责人赵安博、王晓云、万复、伍绍祖等。
    在北京的日本和平人士西园寺公一和其他日本朋友应邀出席了酒会。
    日本学生友好参观团一行一百一十八人，是今天上午到达北京的。他们在北京车站上受到了首都青年和学生，以及各有关方面人士的热情欢迎。
