Japanese Social Party member Nanamotō Katsumi, who recently visited China and returned to Japan, has published a series of articles in the "Chōshū Shinbun" praising China's significant achievements in revolutionary ideological education and its sincere and substantial support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism. The articles also condemn the hypocritical behavior of the Soviet revisionist leadership in pretending to aid Vietnam while actually colluding with the United States.

Nanamotō wrote in his articles that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and guided by Mao Zedong Thought, are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The political awareness of workers and peasants is greatly enhanced. The Chinese people love socialism, they think boldly, act courageously, and concentrate all their efforts on building socialism.

The articles state that China uses Soviet revisionism as a negative example, striving to avoid repeating the mistakes of the Soviet Union. In China, people recognize that the second and third generations have not experienced the hardships of the old society and lack revolutionary struggle experience. Therefore, special emphasis is placed on educating young people in revolutionary ideology, the masses' viewpoint, the labor viewpoint, and internationalism. The articles point out, "China's second and third generations will become the true masters of socialist construction, impervious to revisionism." It is laughable for U.S. Secretary of State Rusk to "hope for the second and third generations in China."

Nanamotō Katsumi also enthusiastically praises the tremendous efforts made by the Chinese people to support Vietnam's struggle against American imperialism. He points out that China is more resolute than any other country in supporting and aiding the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people.

Nanamotō Katsumi refutes the slander by the Soviet leadership that "China obstructs the passage of Soviet military aid to Vietnam." He says, "The Soviet side claims that the Soviet Union and Vietnam do not share a border, but does it share a border with India and Cuba?" He further points out that in the Vietnamese issue, "the Soviet Union's passive attitude and nominal aid only make American imperialist aggression more ferocious and brutal." He says, "The Soviet Union is not genuinely engaged in anti-imperialist struggle but is aiding American imperialist aggression."

　　日本访华人士赞扬中国真正支援越南人民反美斗争
　　毛主席指导文化大革命提高了工农觉悟
    新华社东京十三日电　最近访问中国后回到日本的日本社会党党员楠本拮美在《长周新闻》上连续发表文章，热情赞扬中国的革命思想教育的巨大成就，赞扬中国人民真诚地大力进行援越抗美的斗争。文章还谴责苏联修正主义领导假援越真联美的无耻行为。
    楠本在文章中写道，中国人民正在中国共产党的领导下，以毛泽东思想为指导，进行文化大革命，
            工人和农民的思想觉悟正在大大提高。中国人民热爱社会主义，他们大胆地思考，勇敢地行动，集中全力建设社会主义。
    文章说，中国把苏联修正主义作为反面教员，努力防止重蹈苏联的覆辙。在中国，人们鉴于第二代、第三代没有体验过旧社会之苦，没有革命斗争的经验，因此特别重视对青少年进行革命思想教育、群众观点和劳动观点的教育以及国际主义的教育。文章指出，“中国的第二代、第三代将成为修正主义所无法侵蚀的、真正的社会主义建设的主人翁”。美国国务卿腊斯克妄想“寄希望于中国的第二代、第三代”，真是可笑已极。
    楠本拮美在文章里还热情赞扬中国人民为援越抗美而作的巨大努力。他指出，中国比任何一个国家都坚决地支持和援助越南人民的英勇斗争。
    楠本拮美驳斥了苏联领导集团制造的所谓“中国阻挠苏联援越军事物资过境”的诽谤。他说，“苏联领导方面说，苏联和越南国境不相连，可是，难道它与印度和古巴之间有共同的国境线吗？”他接着进一步指出，在越南问题上，“苏联的消极态度，虚有其名的援助，只能使美帝国主义的侵略越来越疯狂残暴。”他说，“苏联不是真正在搞反帝斗争，而是在帮助美帝国主义侵略。”
