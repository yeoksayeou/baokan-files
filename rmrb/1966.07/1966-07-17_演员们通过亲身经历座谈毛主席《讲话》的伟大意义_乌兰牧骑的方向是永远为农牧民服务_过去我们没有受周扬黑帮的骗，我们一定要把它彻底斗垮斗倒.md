The actors of the First Team of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Directly Affiliated Ulanqab Cultural Troupe, currently performing in the capital, recently shared their personal experiences of growing up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. They discussed the profound significance of the re-publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and vehemently denounced the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of the literary and art black gang led by Zhou Yang. They stated in the discussion that Mao Zedong's brilliant work is the lifeline of Ulanqab Cultural Troupe actors and all revolutionary literary and art workers, and it is the red sun in our hearts. It has illuminated our path and direction, and it has always inspired us to live in the grasslands and villages for many years, serving the various ethnic farmers and herdsmen wholeheartedly and unconditionally. The actors unanimously expressed that they will resolutely defend Chairman Mao's literary and art line during the nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary plot of the bourgeoisie on the literary and art front, represented by Zhou Yang, to restore capitalism.

Mao Zedong Thought Illuminated the Path for Ulanqab Cultural Troupe

Ulanqab Cultural Troupe grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, and every achievement of Ulanqab Cultural Troupe shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. Over the years, we have developed an extremely deep affection for Mao Zedong Thought and have studied "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" dozens of times. We do as Chairman Mao says. From the day Ulanqab Cultural Troupe was established, we have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's instructions. During our tours in the grasslands, we eat, live, and work with the farmers and herdsmen. We closely follow the Party's central tasks in each period, singing praises to the dear Communist Party of China, to the great leader of all ethnic peoples, Chairman Mao, and to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We go where it is most difficult and perform songs and dances, and we go where it is most needed to propagate and mobilize. By doing so, not only have our thoughts been tempered and transformed, but we have also explored a set of organizational forms and working methods to serve the farmers and herdsmen. This is: a small and efficient team, simple props and costumes, and actors who are versatile. Because of this, the masses warmly welcome us, regarding us as relatives sent by Chairman Mao, and praising us as good actors educated by Chairman Mao. Practice fully proves that Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has provided us with the most complete, thorough, and correct literary and art line. However, the anti-Party black gang led by Zhou Yang has maliciously distorted Chairman Mao's literary and art direction, raising the black banner of "popular art" to attack us for following the Party's central tasks, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving proletarian politics as "simplification" and "dogmatism." Just by looking at the attacks and slanders of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries against us, one can fully see that Zhou Yang's anti-Mao Zedong Thought revisionist literary and art black goods are precisely for preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

Mongolian actor Sambuu and Han actor Feng Jinying pointed out during the discussion that the small group of bourgeois representatives led by Zhou Yang, the "patriarch," distorted Chairman Mao's literary and art direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, saying that "the art of any class is not just for the class itself, but for all classes, and it resonates with everyone." They vigorously promote "popular art." Chairman Mao has long taught us: "You are a bourgeois artist, you sing praises to the bourgeoisie; you are a proletarian artist, you sing praises to the proletariat and the laboring people: one must choose one of the two." Chairman Mao's words have taught us that art is subordinate to politics and there is absolutely no such thing as "popular art" as Zhou Yang said. The purpose of these bad guys in saying these words is to promote class reconciliation and conspire to restore capitalism in China, which is absolutely impossible. The great Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated our path forward. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings and forever serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serve proletarian politics, and serve socialism!

The actors who participated in the discussion unanimously pointed out that the Zhou Yang black gang distorted Chairman Mao's literary and art line, opposed literary and art workers integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and transforming their bourgeois worldview. They attempted to pull our proletarian literary and art warriors onto the capitalist and revisionist evil path to serve their restoration of capitalism. We in Ulanqab Cultural Troupe do not pay any attention to their tricks. We resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's literary and art line, enthusiastically sing praises to the great Mao Zedong Thought, sing praises to the heroic figures of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and sing the opposite song on the stage dominated by emperors, generals, talents, and beauties. We engage in a face-to-face struggle with the literary and art black line. Because of this, the Zhou Yang anti-Party black gang maliciously slanders us for having too much "gunpowder." We say, "gunpowder" is good, the more the better! We are determined to fight against this black line. We are determined to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, sing revolutionary battle songs, and fight against this small black gang until we smash and overthrow them, and we will not stop until we achieve complete victory!

Act According to Chairman Mao's Instructions, Starting from the Needs of the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

The actors severely refuted the reactionary fallacies of the small black gang in the literary and art world, such as Zhou Yang, who slandered them for being "neither fish nor fowl" and having a low level for years of deep integration with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They pointed out that these black gang members are not just slandering us in Ulanqab Cultural Troupe, but are also maliciously attacking Chairman Mao's statements on the issue of popularization and elevation of literature and art. Chairman Mao said: "Our literature and art, since they are basically for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, then so-called popularization is popularization among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and so-called elevation is elevation from the workers, peasants, and soldiers." We act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, starting from the needs of the various ethnic farmers and herdsmen instead of the needs of the bourgeoisie. We implement being versatile, carrying out popularization work among the farmers and herdsmen; at the same time, we pay special attention to improving our performance level and creation quality in the process of integrating with the farmers and herdsmen to meet the needs of the farmers and herdsmen. The so-called "elevation" that Zhou Yang and other black gang members want is completely away from the direction of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. It is not elevation from the foundation of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but elevation from the foundation of the bourgeoisie, attempting to make us in Ulanqab Cultural Troupe elevate our literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers to the so-called "height" of the bourgeoisie. We resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions. As long as the workers, peasants, and soldiers issue an "approval," our literature and art are both correct and high.

Mongolian actor Darjmaa said: "During the tour performances, I personally felt the urgent desire of the laboring people for revolutionary literature and art. They not only want to watch songs and dances but also want to watch lantern slides and listen to music. Chairman Mao taught us to start from the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. I act according to Chairman Mao's teachings. If the farmers and herdsmen need me to sing, I sing; if they need me to dance, I dance; if they need me to act, I act; if they need me to play music, I play music; if they need me to do something, I do it; if they need me to do it in a certain way, I do it in that way. I am the son of a poor herdsman with a low cultural level, and I have encountered many difficulties in doing this. But Chairman Mao's instructions and the needs of the farmers and herdsmen have given me courage. Over the years, I have learned to sing, dance, act, paint, and play various instruments such as the horse-head fiddle, accordion, erhu, pipa, sanxian, yangqin, and others. I have also mastered some simple techniques for giving farmers and herdsmen haircuts, repairing watches, and repairing radios. Therefore, the masses praise me for being good at everything. The facts have refuted the fallacies of the Zhou Yang black gang. Deep integration with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, not only can literature and art be popularized but also can be continuously elevated.

Han actress Li Guiying said: As the Zhou Yang black gang distorted Chairman Mao's literary and art line, the strong demand of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for revolutionary literature and art has long been unsatisfied. We literary and art workers should of course "add flowers to brocade" and create dazzling socialist new literature and art in human history; but what is more important at present is to "deliver coal in the snow" and carry out the popularization of literature and art. Over the years, I have acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, learned from the farmers and herdsmen during the tour performances, and carried out ideological transformation. At the same time, I have created spoken and sung performances such as "Red Family," "Sending My Brother to Enlist," and "Eliminating the Weeds of Intoxicated Horses Like Eliminating Ghosts and Snakes." I have made great progress in my career. I feel that literary and art workers can only truly elevate themselves by acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, honestly integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only by participating in the work of "delivering coal in the snow" can we gradually achieve "adding flowers to brocade." If we detach ourselves from the workers, peasants, and soldiers and do not serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we cannot even talk about "adding flowers to brocade," and we cannot possibly have the elevation needed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The evil purpose of the Zhou Yang gang in slandering us as "neither fish nor fowl" and having a low level is precisely to oppose literary and art workers integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and it is precisely to oppose Chairman Mao's instructions on the literary and art direction.

The actors talked about the scenes where they were warmly welcomed by the farmers and herdsmen despite their hardships. They pointed out: During the tour performances in the vast grasslands, we often have to walk dozens of miles a day, sometimes even seventy or eighty miles. Upon arrival at the destination, we have to busy ourselves with makeup and perform for several hours. Sometimes, to let the farmers and herdsmen who came late also see the performance, we have to perform continuously without regard for fatigue. This life is very hard and tense, but it is also extremely glorious. The broad masses of farmers and herdsmen all praise us as "good actors educated by Chairman Mao," complimenting us on our performances and praising us. They warmly care for us and help us. Once, we performed for the herdsmen in the cold, performing outdoors while the community members watched outdoors. Our hands and feet were frozen numb, but no one complained, and we persisted to the end. After the performance, a few old women ran over, unbuttoned their upper clothes, and pulled the female actors into their arms to warm them with their body heat, saying, "Chairman Mao cares so much for us herdsmen, sending you to perform in the cold, we must work hard to improve production!" The broad masses welcome and care for us so much, making us see even more clearly the reactionary face of the Zhou Yang black gang. You black gang members, listen: Even in the coldest winter, we will not freeze our determination to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers; even in the hottest summer, we will not melt our will to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers; your black words, no matter how malicious, will not shake our confidence in serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The road of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we have decided to walk!

Study Chairman Mao's Works for a Lifetime, Propagate Mao Zedong Thought for a Lifetime

Mongolian actors Jin Hua and Qimuoge also angrily refuted the reactionary fallacies of the Zhou Yang black gang's so-called "formulaic" and "uniform." They said: Zhou Yang and his gang are using the pretext of opposing "formulaic" and "uniform" to obstruct literary and art workers from singing praises to the glorious and correct Communist Party of China, opposing us from singing praises to the great leader of all ethnic peoples, Chairman Mao, and singing praises to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This is completely a pipe dream and a wild fantasy! Ulanqab Cultural Troupe is a new type of literary and art troupe that has grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. We have not been deceived by them in the past, and we will not be deceived by them in the future! We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and wherever we go, we will sing praises to the Party and Chairman Mao, and wherever we go, we will spread Mao Zedong Thought!

The comrades who participated in the discussion cited a large number of facts to show that the various ethnic peoples of Inner Mongolia have unlimited love for the Party and Chairman Mao and unlimited faith in the great Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, literary and art performances that sing praises to the Party and Chairman Mao and sing praises to Mao Zedong Thought always resonate strongly with them and are warmly welcomed by them. We support it, the enemy opposes it; we sing praises to it, the enemy hates it, which precisely shows that this is a life-and-death class struggle between two classes, two standpoints, and two roads. The actors unanimously expressed that they will forever be good students of Chairman Mao, forever regard Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as the highest instruction, forever be red propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought for a lifetime. Singing a revolutionary song, dancing a revolutionary dance, and performing a revolutionary performance are all propagations of Mao Zedong Thought and are all bullets fired at the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black gang.

We will forever be steadfast proletarian revolutionary literary and art warriors.

    演员们通过亲身经历座谈毛主席《讲话》的伟大意义
　　乌兰牧骑的方向是永远为农牧民服务
　　过去我们没有受周扬黑帮的骗，我们一定要把它彻底斗垮斗倒
    新华社十六日讯　正在首都公演的内蒙古自治区直属乌兰牧骑第一队的演员们，最近用他们在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的亲身经历，畅谈毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》重新发表的重大意义，怒斥文艺黑帮首领周扬反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。他们在座谈中说，毛主席的这部光辉著作是我们乌兰牧骑演员和一切革命文艺工作者的命根子，是我们心中的红太阳。它为我们照亮了前进的方向和道路，它永远鼓舞着我们长年生活在草原农村，全心全意地无条件地为各族农牧民服务。演员们一致表示，一定要在全国无产阶级文化大革命中，坚决捍卫毛主席文艺路线，彻底粉碎文艺战线上以周扬为代表的资产阶级反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的复辟阴谋。
　  毛泽东思想给乌兰牧骑照亮了前进的道路
    达斡尔族演员乌嫩齐说：乌兰牧骑是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的，乌兰牧骑的每一点成绩都闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉。几年来，我们对毛泽东思想怀着无比深厚的感情，几十遍地学习《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。我们乌兰牧骑从建队的那一天起，就坚决执行毛主席的指示，在草原上巡回演出时，和农牧民同吃、同住、同劳动。我们紧密配合党在各个时期的中心任务，歌颂亲爱的中国共产党、歌颂各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，哪里最艰苦就到哪里去送歌献舞，哪里最需要就到哪里去宣传鼓动。这样做，不光使我们的思想得到了锻炼和改造，而且还摸索出一套为农牧民服务的组织形式和工作方法，这就是：队伍短小精干，道具服装简便，演员一专多能。正因为这样，所以群众热烈欢迎我们，把我们当作毛主席派来的亲人，称赞我们是毛主席教导出来的好演员。实践充分说明，毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》给我们提出了最完整、最彻底、最正确的文艺路线。但是周扬一伙反党黑帮却恶毒地篡改毛主席的文艺方向，扯起“全民文艺”的修正主义黑旗，攻击我们配合党的中心任务、为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务是“简单化”、“教条主义”。只要看看帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派攻击和诬蔑我们的言论，就完全可以看出，周扬的那一套与毛泽东思想相对抗的修正主义文艺黑货，正是为资本主义复辟作舆论准备的。
    蒙古族桑布和汉族冯金英等演员在座谈时指出，以周扬这个“祖师爷”为首的一小撮资产阶级代表人物，篡改毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，说什么“任何一个阶级的艺术，绝不只是给本阶级看的，它是给所有阶级看的，引起了所有人的共鸣”，他们拚命鼓吹“全民文艺”。毛主席早就教导我们：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”毛主席这段话教导了我们，艺术是从属于政治的，绝没有象周扬所说的
  “全民文艺”。周扬这一伙坏家伙说这些话的目的是要搞阶级调和，阴谋在中国复辟资本主义，这是绝对办不到的。伟大的毛泽东思想已经给我们照亮了前进的道路，我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，永远为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义服务！
    参加座谈的演员一致指出，周扬黑帮篡改毛主席的文艺路线，反对文艺工作者与工农兵相结合，改造资产阶级世界观，企图把我们无产阶级的文艺战士拉到资本主义、修正主义的邪路上去，为他们实现资本主义复辟效劳。我们乌兰牧骑根本不理睬那一套，坚决执行毛主席的文艺路线，热烈歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想，歌颂工农兵英雄人物，与帝王将相、才子佳人统治的舞台大唱对台戏，同文艺黑线进行针锋相对的斗争，正因为这样，所以周扬反党黑帮恶毒地诬蔑我们“火药味”太浓。我们说，“火药味”好得很，越浓越好！我们就是要和你们这条黑线斗，我们就是要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，大唱革命战歌，把你们这一小撮黑帮斗垮、斗倒，不获全胜，决不收兵！
    照毛主席指示办事，从工农兵需要出发
    演员们对周扬等一小撮文艺界黑帮诬蔑他们一专多能是“四不象”，长年深入工农兵“水平不高”等反动谬论，进行了严厉驳斥。他们指出，这些黑帮分子在这里绝不只是诬蔑我们乌兰牧骑，而是对毛主席关于文艺普及与提高问题的论述进行恶毒攻击。毛主席说：“我们的文艺，既然基本上是为工农兵，那末所谓普及，也就是向工农兵普及，所谓提高，也就是从工农兵提高。”我们按照毛主席的教导，从各族农牧民的需要出发而不是从资产阶级的需要出发，实行了一专多能，向农牧民进行文艺普及工作；同时，我们还特别注意在深入农牧民群众的过程中，不断提高自己的演出水平，提高创作质量，来满足农牧民群众的需要。周扬等黑帮所要的“提高”，完全是离开工农兵群众的方向，不是从工农兵群众的基础上去提高，而是从资产阶级的基础上去提高，企图叫我们乌兰牧骑把为工农兵服务的文艺提到资产阶级的所谓“高度”上去。我们坚决执行毛主席的指示，只要工农兵群众发了“批准书”，我们的文艺就是象，就是高。
    蒙古族演员达日玛说：“在巡回演出中，我亲身感受到劳动人民渴望革命文艺的急切心情。他们不光要看歌舞，还要看幻灯、听音乐。毛主席教导我们从工农兵出发，为工农兵服务，我就按毛主席的教导去做。农牧民需要我唱歌我就唱歌，需要我跳舞我就跳舞，需要我演戏我就演戏，需要我奏乐我就奏乐，需要我干什么我就干什么，需要我怎么干我就怎么干。我是个贫苦牧民的儿子，文化水平低，这样做遇到过不少困难。但毛主席的指示和农牧民的需要给我鼓了劲。几年来，我学会了唱歌、跳舞、演戏，学会了绘画和马头琴、手风琴、二胡、板胡、四胡、三弦、扬琴等多种乐器，还掌握了为农牧民理发、修表、修收音机的简单技术。因此群众夸赞我干什么都象。事实无情地驳斥了周扬黑帮的谬论，深入工农兵，为工农兵服务，文艺工作不仅能够得到普及，而且能够得到不断的提高。
    汉族女演员李桂英说：由于周扬黑帮篡改了毛主席的文艺路线，广大工农兵群众对革命文艺的强烈要求长期得不到满足。我们文艺工作者当然要“锦上添花”，创造人类历史上光辉灿烂的社会主义新文艺；但当前更重要的是为工农兵群众“雪里送炭”，进行文艺的普及工作。这几年我根据毛主席的指示，在巡回演出中向农牧民学习，进行思想改造，同时创作了《红色家庭》、《送哥哥去参军》、《象铲除醉马草一样把牛鬼蛇神铲光》等说唱节目，在业务上有了很大提高。我体会到，文艺工作者只有按照毛主席的指示办事，老老实实地深入工农兵，为工农兵服务，才能得到真正的提高；只有参加“雪里送炭”的工作，才能逐步做到“锦上添花”。如果脱离工农兵，不为工农兵服务，就根本谈不上“锦上添花”，就根本不可能有为工农兵所需要的提高。而周扬之流诬蔑我们“四不象”“水平不高”的罪恶目的，正是反对文艺工作者深入工农兵，为工农兵服务，正是反对毛主席指示的文艺方向。
    演员们谈到他们不辞劳苦为农牧民服务受到热烈欢迎的情景。他们指出：在大草原上巡回演出，常常一天要走几十里路以至七八十里路。到了目的地，又要忙着化装，进行几个小时的演出，有时候，为了使来晚了的农牧民也能看到节目，还要不顾疲劳地连续演出。这种生活是很艰苦很紧张的。但也是极其光荣的。广大农牧民都称赞我们是“毛主席教育出来的好演员”，夸奖我们演得象、演得好，热情地关怀我们、帮助我们。有一次，我们冒着严寒为牧民演出，我们在露天演，社员们在露天看。手脚冻麻了，但谁也没叫苦，一直坚持到底。演出结束后，几个牧民老大娘跑过来，解开自己的上衣，把我们的女演员拉到怀里，用自己的体温给女演员取暖，嘴里还说：“毛主席这样关心我们牧民，大冷的天派你们来演戏，我们一定要把生产搞好！”广大群众对我们如此欢迎和体贴，更使我们看清了周扬黑帮的反动嘴脸。你们这些黑帮分子听着：冬天再冷冻不掉我们为工农兵服务的决心，夏天再热化不了我们为工农兵服务的意志，你们的黑话再恶毒动摇不了我们为工农兵服务的信心，为工农兵服务的道路，我们是走定了！
    学习一辈子毛主席著作，宣传一辈子毛泽东思想
    蒙古族演员金花和其木格等人，还愤怒驳斥了周扬黑帮的所谓“公式化”“千篇一律”的反动谬论。她们说：周扬这帮家伙打着反对“公式化”“千篇一律”的幌子，目的是要阻挠文艺工作者歌颂光荣正确的中国共产党，反对我们歌颂各族人民伟大的领袖毛主席和歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想。这完全是白日做梦，痴心妄想！我们乌兰牧骑演出队是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的一支新型文艺队伍，过去没有受他们的骗，今后也决不会上他们的当！我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，走到哪里就在哪里高唱党和毛主席的颂歌，走到哪里就在哪里传播毛泽东思想！
    参加座谈会的同志列举大量事实说明，内蒙古各族人民无限热爱党和毛主席，无限信仰伟大的毛泽东思想，因此歌颂党和毛主席、歌颂毛泽东思想的文艺节目，总是激起他们强烈的共鸣，受到他们热烈的欢迎。我们拥护，敌人反对，我们歌颂，敌人仇视，正好说明这是一场两个阶级、两个立场、两条道路的誓不两立的、你死我活的阶级斗争。演员们一致表示：要永远做毛主席的好学生，永远把毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》当作最高指示，永远做毛泽东思想的红色宣传员，一辈子学习毛主席著作，一辈子宣传毛泽东思想。唱一次革命歌，跳一次革命舞，演一个革命节目，都是宣传一次毛泽东思想，都是向反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮射出的子弹。
    我们要永远做坚强的无产阶级革命文艺战士。
