A Communist Party member should be open and aboveboard, loyal, and active. He should regard the interests of the revolution as his first and foremost concern, and subordinate his personal interests to the interests of the revolution. He should stand firm for the correct principles and wage tireless struggles against all incorrect thoughts and actions, so as to consolidate the collective life of the Party and strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses. He should care more for the Party and the masses than for himself, and more for others than for himself. Only thus can he be considered a Communist Party member.

From "Oppose Liberalism"

    毛主席语录
    一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益；无论何时何地，坚持正确的原则，同一切不正确的思想和行为作不疲倦的斗争，用以巩固党的集体生活，巩固党和群众的联系；关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。这样才算得一个共产党员。
