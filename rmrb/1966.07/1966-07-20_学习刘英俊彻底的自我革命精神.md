The great thought of Mao Zedong has nurtured great communist warriors. Liu Yingjun, like countless heroes and models of our time, grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. His diary is a vivid record of his active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect.

Liu Yingjun's active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works have several distinct features.

He particularly emphasized learning Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, establishing a clear understanding of class and class struggle.

It was from the perspective of class struggle and revolutionary needs that he focused on transforming his worldview and engaging in self-criticism during his studies. He frequently conducted self-criticism and welcomed criticism from others. He did not hide or overlook his shortcomings; once identified, he would criticize and correct them in light of Chairman Mao's instructions. He believed that failing to overcome shortcomings would affect the quality of service to the people, while accepting criticism would enable better service to the people. In exposing and overcoming his own shortcomings and errors, he was a fearless and thorough materialist.

He dared to practice, insisting on learning and using knowledge for the revolution, fully integrating theory with practice, and transforming both the subjective and objective worlds. In revolutionary practice, his attitude was sincere. He once said, "Only those who contribute everything for the revolution are true humans. Whether I can become such a person remains to be tested in practice. I truly understand that 'practice is the sole criterion for testing truth'; I will be tested by practice." In revolutionary practice, he steadily and step-by-step transformed himself, as he said, "Starting from small goals, advancing towards big goals," until he could voluntarily dedicate everything, including his life, to the great cause of communism.

Chairman Mao said that the philosophy of the proletariat is a philosophy of struggle.

Liu Yingjun truly understood Chairman Mao's teaching. He believed that revolution means struggle, and struggle brings happiness. He struggled against class enemies, against bourgeois fallacies, against pure military views, and against difficulties in work. To achieve victory in these struggles, he first struggled against non-proletarian ideological consciousness in his own mind.

His diary is filled with active ideological struggles and strict self-criticism, serving as a record of his conscious self-revolution and self-transformation under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Without destruction, there can be no construction. The proletarian worldview can only be established through struggle against the bourgeois worldview and against all old ideas and habits. Liu Yingjun's ability to quickly establish a proletarian worldview is inseparable from his spirit of thorough revolution and self-criticism.

When Liu Yingjun heroically sacrificed himself, he was only twenty-one years old. However, because he truly regarded Chairman Mao's books as the highest directives, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, learning and applying in struggle, and focusing on transforming his worldview, he had already grown into what Chairman Mao described as a person of high moral character, a pure person, a person with integrity, a person free from vulgar interests, and a person beneficial to the people, despite his young age.

People have rightly said, "Liu Yingjun has a thousand good points, ten thousand good points, but ultimately, it is because he actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works."

To learn from Liu Yingjun, we must learn to consciously and actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works.

We must, like him, start from the perspective of class struggle, fully recognizing the importance of self-transformation.

We must, like him, frequently engage in strict self-criticism.

We must, like him, sincerely strengthen ourselves through revolutionary struggle.

We must, like him, use Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, consciously and thoroughly engage in self-revolution.

### 学习刘英俊彻底的自我革命精神

    学习刘英俊彻底的自我革命精神
    伟大的毛泽东思想，造就了伟大的共产主义战士。刘英俊，同我们时代的千千万万个英雄模范一样，是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的。他的日记，就是一部活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫的生动写实。
    刘英俊活学活用毛主席著作，有几个明显的特点。
    他特别重视学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，树立了明确的阶级和阶级斗争的观点。
    他正是从阶级斗争的需要，从革命的需要出发，在学习中狠抓世界观的改造，狠抓自我批评，不断地进行自己思想上的兴无灭资的斗争。他自己经常进行自我批评，也非常欢迎别人的批评。他对自己的缺点，是一点也不掩饰，不放松的，一旦发现，就对照毛主席的指示，加以批判，加以改正。他认为，不克服缺点，就影响为人民服务的质量，接受批评，就能为人民服务得更好。在暴露和克服自己的缺点和错误方面，他是一个无所畏惧的彻底的唯物主义者。
    他勇于实践，坚持为革命而学，为革命而用，把理论和实践完全结合起来，把改造主观世界和改造客观世界完全结合起来。在革命的实践中，他的态度是老老实实的。他说过：“为革命贡献自己一切的人，才算是一个真正的人。我能否成为这样的人，还有待于实践。我确实深深体会到，‘实践是检验真理的试金石’，我将受实践的考验。”他在革命的实践中，踏踏实实、一步一步地改造自己，就象他自己所说的，“从小的目标开始，向大的目标前进”，直到能够自觉自愿地把自己的一切，以至生命，完全贡献给伟大的共产主义事业。
    毛主席说，无产阶级的哲学，是斗争的哲学。
    刘英俊是真正理解毛主席的这个教导的。他认为，革命就要斗争，斗争就是幸福。他同阶级敌人斗，同资产阶级的谬论斗，同单纯军事观点斗，同工作中的困难斗。为了取得这些斗争的胜利，他首先同自己头脑中的非无产阶级思想意识斗。
    他的日记，充满着积极的思想斗争，充满着严格的自我批评，是一部以毛泽东思想为指针，自觉地进行自我革命、自我改造的记录。
    没有破，就没有立。无产阶级世界观，只有在同资产阶级世界观的斗争中，在同一切旧思想、旧习惯的斗争中，才能树立起来。刘英俊所以能够比较快地树立起无产阶级世界观，是同他的彻底革命精神和自我批评精神分不开的。
    刘英俊同志英勇牺牲的时候，只有二十一岁。但是，由于他真正把毛主席的书当作最高指示，活学活用毛主席著作，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，特别在改造世界观上狠下功夫。所以，他尽管还很年轻，却已经成长为如毛主席所说的，一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。
    人们说得好：“刘英俊有一千个好，一万个好，归根到底是活学活用毛主席著作好。”
    学习刘英俊，就要学习他自觉地活学活用毛主席著作。
    就要象他那样，从阶级斗争的观点出发，充分认识到自我改造的重要性。
    就要象他那样，经常地进行严格的自我批评。
    就要象他那样，老老实实地在革命斗争的实践中加强锻炼。
    就要象他那样，以毛泽东思想为指针，自觉地、彻底地进行自我革命。
