	Japan recently published the 1966 "New China Yearbook" edited by the China Research Institute, which introduces the movement of studying Chairman Mao's works at the People's University of China.

	The yearbook states that China is currently in the era where, as Marx said, once theory is grasped by the masses, it will also become a material force. In recent years, the Chinese people have, through the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's works, not only made party members, young communists, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army recognize that "all work is for the revolution," but have also ensured that this is put into practice. Workers in all industries have linked their work with the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

	The yearbook introduces the story of Li Suwen, a salesperson at the Shenyang Peace Food Store, who studies and applies Chairman Mao's works. The yearbook says that Li Suwen, through studying Chairman Mao's works, has come to understand that Mao Zedong Thought is an inexhaustible revolutionary treasure trove, and that Chairman Mao's works are the compass of revolution, the driving force of action, and the source of strength.

　　日本编辑出版《新中国年鉴》
　　介绍中国人民大学毛主席著作运动
    新华社东京十一日电　最近在日本由中国研究所编辑出版的一九六六年《新中国年鉴》介绍了中国劳动人民大学毛主席著作的运动。
    年鉴说，中国正处在马克思所说的理论一经掌握群众，也会变成物质力量的时代。最近一两年，中国人民通过开展活学活用毛泽东主席著作的运动，不仅共产党员、共青团员、解放军战士，而且所有行业的广大群众，都认识到“一切工作都是为了革命”，同时把它贯彻到行动中去。各行业的广大职工群众，都把自己的工作同中国革命和世界革命联系起来。
    年鉴介绍了沈阳市和平副食品商店营业员李素文活学活用毛主席著作的事迹。年鉴说，李素文从学习毛主席的著作中，认识到毛泽东思想是取之不尽、用之不竭的革命宝库，毛泽东主席的著作是革命的指针、行动的动力、力量的源泉。
