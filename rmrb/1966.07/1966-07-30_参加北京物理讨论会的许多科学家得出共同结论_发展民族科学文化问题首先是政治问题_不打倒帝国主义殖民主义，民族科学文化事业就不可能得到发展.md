In many countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania that have long suffered from imperialist aggression and oppression, what is the fundamental issue in developing national scientific and cultural affairs? Many scientists participating in the Beijing Physics Discussion Meeting reached a common conclusion through heated discussions over the past few days: this is primarily a political issue. Without overthrowing imperialism and colonialism and achieving genuine national independence and liberation, the development of national scientific and cultural affairs is impossible.

The discussion on this issue was initiated by an Argentine scientist at the academic meeting of the physics teaching group. This scientist mentioned that due to Argentina being controlled by foreign powers, there is no freedom in education and scientific research. Many foreign companies control Argentina's economic lifelines and do not employ Argentine scientific researchers, who often face unemployment. This Argentine scientist concluded that the fundamental issue of education is not education itself but a political issue. Education cannot be separated from society, just as form cannot be separated from content.

The Argentine scientist's remarks sparked a heated response at the meeting. Scientists from various countries shared their experiences and personal observations based on their countries' situations. Sierra Leonean scientist Jallo mentioned in his paper that some universities in Africa have educational systems designed to meet the demands of colonial powers, with some universities even having their curricula and teaching outlines dictated by foreigners. He pointed out that a radical change is needed to alter this situation. In many African countries, only by fundamentally breaking free from imperialist control can the educational issue be resolved. Colombian scientist Gamba, in a paper he read, pointed out that science cannot be separated from social conditions, and it is wrong to separate physics teaching from political issues.

Due to the reactionary ruling class in Japan following the policies of the U.S. imperialists, Japan's education is increasingly Americanized. Japanese scientist Yoshiki Morita mentioned that after World War II, Japan adopted a set of American educational methods in physics teaching, causing the educational sector to lose its national characteristics. He said that teaching methods are also constrained by social conditions, and good teaching methods are not feasible under Japan's current reality. Japanese scientist Mikio Nagi also mentioned that there is currently a serious problem in Japan where university graduates cannot find jobs. This situation must be attributed to political causes, which are a result of the social system.

The leader of the Indonesian scientific delegation, Suhariyo, presented a paper at the meeting that deeply illustrated the different experiences of Indonesian national scientific and cultural affairs in different historical periods, showing that the development of national scientific and cultural affairs is inseparable from the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial revolution. His paper further deepened the understanding of scientists from various countries on this issue.

Suhariyo mentioned that during the Dutch colonial period, Indonesian schools were tools for colonial rule and exploitation of Indonesia. After the Dutch were expelled, Indonesia's national economy and scientific culture saw some development. However, the Americans quickly took control of important economic sectors such as Indonesian oil development, and American teachers replaced Dutch teachers in school education. American textbooks replaced Dutch textbooks. The massive cultural infiltration by the U.S. seriously hindered the development of Indonesian national scientific and cultural affairs. Last October, the U.S. imperialists, in order to suppress the anti-imperialist revolutionary high tide of the Indonesian people, orchestrated a counter-revolutionary military coup, further placing Indonesian national scientific affairs and academic life in a deplorable situation. He pointed out that historical experience tells us that the development of national scientific and cultural affairs must be closely linked to the tasks of national democratic revolution. During the discussion, scientists also pointed out that many newly independent countries in the four continents must quickly eliminate the influence of imperialism, develop national scientific and cultural affairs, and urgently cultivate local teachers, compile local textbooks, and use local languages for teaching. Chinese physicists, in the discussion, cited some situations in old Chinese universities to illustrate that using textbooks from Western capitalist countries and teaching in foreign languages would make students blindly admire the West, lose national pride, and develop a sense of national inferiority, paving the way for imperialist cultural infiltration. The leader of the Vietnamese scientific delegation, Wei Ruqiong, after introducing Vietnam's achievements in abolishing Western textbooks and compiling their own textbooks in Vietnamese, pointed out that without using the national language for teaching, national scientific and cultural development is not possible. A Sri Lankan scientist pointed out that we cannot use English to popularize science among the people; we must use the national language they are familiar with to achieve this.

    参加北京物理讨论会的许多科学家得出共同结论 
    发展民族科学文化问题首先是政治问题
    不打倒帝国主义殖民主义，民族科学文化事业就不可能得到发展
    新华社二十九日讯  在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲许多长期遭受帝国主义侵略和压迫的国家里，发展民族科学文化事业的根本问题是什么？参加北京物理讨论会的许多科学家，在连日来的热烈讨论中得出了共同的结论：这首先是一个政治问题。不打倒帝国主义和殖民主义，没有真正的民族独立和解放，民族科学文化事业是不可能得到发展的。
    对这个问题的讨论，是由一位阿根廷科学家在物理教学组学术会议上首先提出来的。这位科学家谈到，由于阿根廷受到外国的控制，那里没有教育和科学研究的自由。许多外国的大公司掌握着阿根廷的经济命脉，它们不任用阿根廷籍的科学研究人员，这些研究人员得到的命运是经常失业。这位阿根廷科学家由此得出结论说：教育的根本问题不是教育问题本身，而是一个政治问题。教育不能与社会分开，正象形式不能与内容分开一样。
    阿根廷科学家的发言，在讨论会上引起了热烈的反响。科学家们纷纷根据自己国家的遭遇和本人的亲身经历，就这个问题发表自己的意见。塞拉勒窝内科学家贾洛在他的论文中谈到，非洲有些大学的教育制度是适应殖民主义国家的要求制定的，有些大学连科目和教学大纲都是由外国制定的，这种状况需要一个剧烈的变革才能改变。他还指出，在非洲的许多国家里，只有从根本上摆脱帝国主义的控制，才能解决教育问题。哥伦比亚科学家甘巴在他宣读的一篇论文中指出，我们不能把科学与社会情况分开，如果把物理教学与政治问题分开是错误的。
    由于日本反动统治阶级执行追随美帝国主义的政策，日本在教育方面也日益美国化。日本科学家野上茂吉郎谈到，第二次世界大战以后的日本，在物理教学方面执行了一整套美国的教育方法，使得教育事业丧失了日本的民族特点。他说，教学方法也受到社会条件的限制，在日本的现实条件下，好的教学方法是行不通的。日本科学家并木美喜雄还谈到，目前在日本发生了大学毕业生找不到工作的严重问题。这种情况不能不归结为政治原因，即是由社会制度造成的。
    印度尼西亚科学家代表团团长苏哈里约在讨论会上宣读的一篇论文，以印度尼西亚民族科学文化在不同历史时期的不同遭遇深刻地说明，民族科学文化的发展是同反帝、反殖的革命分不开的。他的论文，使各国科学家对这个问题的认识更深入了一步。
    苏哈里约谈到，在荷兰殖民主义者的统治时期，印度尼西亚的学校是殖民主义者统治和掠夺印度尼西亚的工具。荷兰人被赶走以后，印度尼西亚的民族经济和科学文化是比以前有了一些发展。但是，美国人紧接着荷兰人控制了印度尼西亚的石油开发等重要经济命脉，在学校教育中也由美国教师代替了荷兰教师。美国教科书代替了荷兰教科书。美国的大量文化渗透，严重地阻碍了印度尼西亚民族科学文化事业的发展。去年十月美帝国主义为了扼杀印度尼西亚人民反帝革命的高潮而策动的反动军事政变，更把印度尼西亚的民族科学事业和学术生活置于极为可悲的境地。他指出，历史的经验告诉我们，民族科学文化事业的发展必须同民族民主革命的任务紧密地联系在一起。在讨论中，科学家们还指出，四大洲许多新独立国家要彻底清除帝国主义的影响，发展各国民族科学文化事业，还必须迅速培养本民族的师资，编制本民族的教科书，使用本民族的语言教学。中国物理学工作者在讨论中引证旧中国大学中的一些情况说明，利用西方资本主义国家的教科书，用外国语讲课，会使学生盲目地崇拜西方，丧失民族自尊心，产生民族自卑感，为帝国主义的文化侵略开辟道路。越南科学家代表团团长魏如昆嵩在发言中介绍了越南废除西方教科书和用越南文编写自己的教科书方面取得的成就之后指出，不用本国的语言教学，就不能发展民族的科学文化。一位锡兰科学家指出，我们决不能用英语把科学普及到人民当中去，必须用他们所熟悉的本国语言去普及。
