“Mao Zedong brings blessings to the Chinese people, so the Chinese people praise him; Mao Zedong brings blessings to the people of the world, so the people of the world respect him.” This was the exclamation of an Algerian audience member after watching a performance by the Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe from China, expressing the broad masses of African people's love for Chairman Mao.

From January to June this year, the Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe visited Sudan, Somalia, Morocco, and Algeria, four African countries, for nearly half a year of performances. They traveled over 30,000 li, performed 82 shows in 44 cities of various sizes, and had 140,000 audience members appreciate Chinese acrobatic arts. Wherever the Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe went, the local people expressed their love for Chairman Mao in various ways, revealing their affection for the revolutionary arts of China under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought.

During a performance in the port of Kismayo in Somalia, a group of Somali youths repeatedly shouted in Chinese, “Long live Mao Zedong!” At that moment, the entire audience was emotionally stirred, with shouts of praise, applause, and music blending into one. A middle school principal told the Chinese acrobatic performers, “We admire the Chinese people’s spirit of steadfastly opposing imperialism. We firmly stand on the side of the Chinese people and are determined to follow the Chinese path.” A high-ranking official said, “Our African countries have exchanges with the great China, and we feel very proud. Some people do not like this, but we do not care.” In the places the acrobatic troupe visited, shouts of “Long live the People’s Republic of China!” “Long live China-Somalia friendship!” and “Down with imperialism!” could be heard everywhere.

In Sudan, the chairman of the football association in a small city, Medani, warmly invited the Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe to his home. When the acrobatic troupe performed in this city, he specially hung a framed embroidered portrait of Chairman Mao, which he had carefully preserved, in the dressing room of the Chinese acrobatic performers, expressing his admiration for Chairman Mao. In Kosti, a boxer affectionately told the Chinese acrobatic performers, “I love Mao Zedong and the new China. I have read Mao Zedong’s articles on guerrilla warfare.” He said, “The Chinese people have a passionate, brave, and strong character. They are the vanguard in opposing imperialist aggression and the most resolute supporters of oppressed nations.”

In Algeria, countless Algerian friends told the members of the Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe: “We know Mao Zedong. It was he who, in the most difficult years of our liberation war, gave us selfless aid and support; it was he who taught us how to use guerrilla warfare to strike the enemy. In one of the Algerian revolutionary bases, the Aurès Mountains, during the years of the liberation war, people read Chairman Mao’s works, which were brought to the guerrilla zones by Algerian underground workers at the risk of their lives. They told us: Mao Zedong’s works were their most precious possession during their guerrilla warfare. When the acrobatic troupe performed there, some audience members could not help but shout, ‘Long live Mao Zedong!’ three times. In the eastern border city of Souk Ahras, although it was surrounded by layers of the ‘Maurice Line’ of colonialists before independence, Mao Zedong’s works still managed to cross this barrier and reach the hands of the people of Souk Ahras. When the performers sang ‘Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman,’ some audience members excitedly shouted, ‘Long live Mao Zedong!’ The director of the National Theater in Constantine said, “Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, your art serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers, which is very correct. We are also exploring how to serve the current reality of struggle. Mao Zedong’s teachings inspire us to overcome difficulties and march forward to victory.”

In Morocco, an actor in a large theater excitedly told the Chinese performers, “I admire Mao Zedong.” He requested the Chinese performers to convey his greetings and respect to Chairman Mao.

The African people love Chairman Mao and the new China. They regard the Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe as an art troupe sent by Chairman Mao, and therefore, they welcome the Chinese acrobatic troupe with particularly deep feelings and appreciate Chinese acrobatic arts.

In the city of Laghouat in Algeria, with a population of only 30,000, a single performance attracted 5,000 spectators from all directions. The crowd packed the outdoor venue of the Chinese acrobatic troupe’s performance so tightly that it was waterproof. In some places, people watched once, twice, and even followed the Chinese acrobatic troupe to nearby places to watch a third time.

An Algerian audience member told the Chinese acrobatic performers, “Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, your art serves the people. Your performances are rich in life’s breath and have a strong national flavor.” The governor of Ghardaïa Province said, “Your performers are so young but perform so well, which shows that your younger generation is growing up healthily and has a bright future.” A friend working in the theater said, “Through your acrobatic arts, one can see the great power and remarkable future of revolutionary China. The reason the United States is so afraid of China is that China is revolutionary and possesses great power.”

The revolutionary art of China, nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought and cultivated by the Communist Party of China, is a flourishing flower that receives love and praise from the revolutionary people of Africa everywhere.

　　非洲人民欢迎毛主席派来的艺术团
    “毛泽东为中国人民造福，所以中国人民歌颂他；毛泽东为世界人民造福，所以世界人民敬爱他。”这是一位阿尔及利亚观众看了中国太原杂技团的演出后发出的欢呼，表达了广大非洲人民热爱毛主席的心情。
    从今年一月到六月，中国太原杂技团到苏丹、索马里、摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚四个非洲国家进行了将近半年的访问演出，行程三万多里，在四十四个大小城市演出了八十二场，有十四万观众欣赏了中国杂技艺术。太原杂技团走到哪里，哪里的群众都以各种不同的方式，表达他们热爱毛泽东主席的感情，流露出他们对毛泽东思想光辉照耀下的中国的革命艺术喜爱的心情。
    在索马里基西马约港口演出时，一群索马里青年一再用中国话欢呼：“毛泽东万岁！”那时候全场情绪激动，欢呼声、鼓掌声和音乐声响成一片。一位中学校长对中国杂技演员说：“我们钦佩中国人民坚持反对帝国主义的精神。我们坚决站在中国人民一边，决心走中国的道路。”一位高级官员说：“我们非洲国家和伟大的中国进行交往，我们感到很骄傲。有人不喜欢这一点，我们不管它。”在杂技团访问过的地方，到处都听到人们的欢呼声：“中华人民共和国万岁！”“中国索马里友谊万岁！”“打倒帝国主义！”
    在苏丹，一个小城市——麦达尼的足球协会主席热情地邀请太原杂技团到他家里去作客。当杂技团在这个城市演出时，他特别把他精心保存的一幅毛主席织锦肖象配上镜框，挂在中国杂技演员的化妆室里，表达他对毛主席的爱戴。在考斯提，一位拳击家对中国杂技演员亲切地说：“我热爱毛泽东，热爱新中国。我读过毛泽东论游击战的文章。”他说：“中国人民具有热情、勇敢、刚强的性格，他们是反对帝国主义侵略的急先锋，是被压迫民族最坚决的支持者。”
    在阿尔及利亚，无数阿尔及利亚朋友对中国杂技团人员说：我们知道毛泽东。是他，在我们解放战争最困难的年代，给了我们无私的援助和支持；是他，告诉我们怎样用游击战争打击敌人。在阿尔及利亚革命根据地之一奥雷斯山区，在解放战争年代里，人们读的毛主席著作是阿尔及利亚地下工作者冒着生命危险带到游击区去的。人们告诉我们：他们在打游击的时候，最宝贵的就是毛泽东著作。当杂技团到那里演出时，有的观众情不自禁地一次、两次、三次地高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”阿尔及利亚东部边境城市苏卡赫拉斯，在独立前虽然被殖民主义者的“莫里斯防线”层层包围，但是毛泽东著作却仍然越过这道防线传到了苏卡赫拉斯人的手中。当杂技团演员们歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》的时候，有的观众兴奋地高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”君士坦丁国家剧院院长说：“在毛泽东主席领导下，你们的艺术为工、农、兵服务，这是很正确的。我们也正在探索怎样为当前的现实斗争服务。毛泽东的教导鼓舞着我们战胜困难胜利前进。”
    在摩洛哥，一个大剧院的演员激动地对中国演员说：“我敬仰毛泽东。”他要求中国演员转达他对毛主席的问候和敬意。
    非洲人民热爱毛主席、热爱新中国。他们把太原杂技团看作是毛主席派来的艺术团，因此以特别深厚的感情来接待中国杂技团，并且赞赏中国的杂技艺术。
    阿尔及利亚的拉格瓦特城只有三万人口，一次演出就有五千名观众从四面八方涌来。人群把中国杂技团演出的露天广场挤得水泄不通。有些地方的人们看了一次、两次，还要追着中国杂技团到邻近的地方再看第三次。
    阿尔及利亚的一位观众对中国杂技演员说：“在毛泽东思想指导下，你们的艺术是为人民服务的。你们的演出有浓厚的生活气息和强烈的民族色彩”。绿州省省长说：“你们的演员很年轻，却演得这么好，可以看出你们年轻的一代在健康地成长，有着光辉的未来。”一位在剧院工作的朋友说：“通过你们的杂技艺术，可以看到革命中国的伟大力量和了不起的未来。美国所以那么怕中国，就是因为中国是革命的，具有伟大的力量。”
    中国的革命的艺术，是在毛泽东思想哺育下，由中国共产党所培植出来的欣欣向荣的花朵，它到处都得到革命的非洲人民的热爱和赞赏。
