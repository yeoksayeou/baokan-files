The Vietnamese people are waging a fierce struggle against the American imperialists. When the enemy is aggressive, they fight bravely; when the enemy retreats, they speed up production. In Hanoi, a mass movement of hatred towards and victory over American imperialism is unfolding. The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army strongly protests against the American imperialists' further increase in troops to South Vietnam, escalating the war.

American imperialism is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. We must keep a clear head, which includes not believing the imperialists' "good words" and not being afraid of their threats.

    美国帝国主义是外强中干的。我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的“好话”和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。
