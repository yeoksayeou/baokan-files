	“Small Programs Should Have a Big Direction”
	—Recalling Comrade Liu Yingjun’s Suggestion

	Platoon Leader Zhang Buyuan

	Comrade Liu Yingjun was a member of our platoon’s revolutionary military committee. During the development of cultural and entertainment activities in the platoon, he conscientiously carried out the highest directives.

	One day in December 1965, I was preparing a lesson in the platoon headquarters when Liu Yingjun came in and said, “Platoon Leader, I have a suggestion. Our platoon has shifted from dispersed missions to concentrated study. In this situation, shouldn’t we better develop cultural and entertainment activities?” I thought this suggestion was good and said, “The political commissars are not here, so you should give more ideas!” Liu Yingjun said, “It would be best to reorganize the performance troupe and then have you give a speech.” I said, “I can’t perform, and I can’t sing. What should I talk about?” Liu Yingjun said, “I think we should thoroughly discuss Chairman Mao’s ‘Talks at the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art’ with us, clarify the direction after the discussion, and then we will specially study it….”

	As soon as he mentioned Chairman Mao’s “Talks at the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art,” Liu Yingjun’s words flowed like a river. He spoke to me endlessly, “Platoon Leader! Have you seen the movie ‘The Enemy at the Gate’? You can see that the movie neither conforms to Chairman Mao’s literary and artistic line nor to his military thought; the direction is wrong! Although our platoon’s performance troupe only performs small programs, small programs should have a big direction! We must do as required in Chairman Mao’s ‘Talks,’ making literature and art serve proletarian politics, emphasizing politics and grasping living thoughts. This year, our platoon has many good people and good deeds from studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works. The current task of the performance troupe is to sing the praises of good people and good deeds who act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions….”

	The problems he thought of and raised deeply inspired me. I felt that he had a firm and correct political direction. I suggested that he become the leader of the performance troupe, but he modestly said, “Let someone else be the leader, and I’ll just give some ideas when the time comes.” Later, according to his suggestion, everyone elected Zhang Mingyi as the leader. From this, I saw that his purpose in actively advocating for the development of cultural and entertainment activities was only one: to firmly emphasize politics and serve to enhance the combat effectiveness of the troops.

	After the performance troupe was organized, I, according to Liu Yingjun’s suggestion, explained the spirit of “Talks at the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art” to everyone, hoping that everyone would firmly act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions… With the direction correct and high spirits, in just a few days, they rehearsed a set of evening programs with good ideological content.

	In more than three months, the performance troupe closely coordinated with ideological education, class education, and the promotion of good people and good deeds. They wrote and performed more than ten programs such as “Vietnamese Heroes Fight Well” and “A Good Model of Learning.” Each performance was well-received by the platoon’s officers and soldiers. Many of these programs were personally created, adapted, or helped to revise by Liu Yingjun. For every program he worked on, he studied Chairman Mao’s works. I saw him study “Talks at the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art” several times.

	Recalling his suggestion, I feel that he deeply understood Chairman Mao’s words. His suggestion was completely in line with the spirit of the “Talks,” and his actions were completely in accordance with the highest directives. He made the suggestion, using the spirit of the highest directives to “direct” my work, making our platoon’s performance activities adhere to Chairman Mao’s literary and artistic line, emphasizing politics, consolidating and expanding the ideological position of the proletariat, and playing a combat role.

　　“小节目要有大方向”
　　——回忆刘英俊同志的一次建议
　　连长　张步远
    刘英俊同志是我们连的革命军人委员会委员。在开展连队文化娱乐活动中，他非常自觉地执行了最高指示。
    一九六五年十二月的一天，我正在连部备课，刘英俊同志进来说：“连长，我想提一个建议。咱们连已经由分散执行任务变成集中学习了，在这种情况下，是不是把文化娱乐活动更好地开展起来？”我觉得这个建议很好，就说：“指导员他们都不在家，你多给出点主意吧！”刘英俊同志说：“最好把演唱组重新组织起来，然后请你给讲讲话。”我说：“我一不会演，二不会唱，你看我讲什么好呀？”刘英俊同志说：“我看要把毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的内容给我们好好讲一讲，讲完了，我们再专门学一学，好明确方向……。”
    一提到毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，刘英俊同志的话匣子就打开了。他滔滔不绝地对我说：“连长啊！你看过《兵临城下》电影没有？你一看就知道了，那个电影既不符合毛主席的文艺路线又不符合毛主席的军事思想，方向不对头！咱们连队演唱组虽然净编小节目，演小节目，可小节目要有大方向啊！一定要按照毛主席《讲话》里要求的那样去做，使文艺为无产阶级政治服务，为突出政治、抓活思想服务。今年，咱们连活学活用毛主席著作出的好人好事特别多，演唱组当前的任务，就是要歌颂按照毛主席指示办事的好人好事……。”
    他想到的问题，提出的问题，深深地启发了我，我觉得他有坚定正确的政治方向。我提出让他当演唱组组长，他非常谦虚地说：“组长让别人当吧，到时候我出出主意就行了。”后来，根据他的建议，大家选举张铭义当了组长。从这里我看到，他积极要求开展文娱活动的目的只有一个，那就是：坚定不移地突出政治，为提高部队的战斗力服务。
    演唱组组织起来以后，我根据刘英俊同志的建议，给大家讲了《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的精神，希望大家坚决按照毛主席的指示办事……。方向对，情绪高，不几天，他们就排出了一套思想内容很好的晚会节目。
    在三个多月的时间里，演唱组紧密配合形势教育、阶级教育，结合宣扬好人好事，编写排演了《越南英雄打得好》、《学习的好模范》等十多个节目，每次演出都很受连队干部战士的欢迎。这些节目当中，有许多都是刘英俊同志亲自创作、改编或帮助修改的。他每搞一个节目都学习毛主席著作，光我就看见他几次学习《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。
    回忆他那次建议，感到他对毛主席的话领会很深。他的建议，完全是按照《讲话》精神提出来的，他的行动，完全是符合最高指示的。他提建议，就是用最高指示的精神“指示”了我的工作，使我们连的演唱活动坚持了毛主席的文艺路线，为突出政治，巩固和扩大无产阶级思想阵地，发挥了战斗作用。　（本版转载《解放军报》）（附图片）
