	At the banquet welcoming scientists from various countries to the Beijing Physics Discussion Meeting, Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen delivered a speech. The full text is as follows:

	Distinguished guests, friends, comrades!

	More than one hundred physicists and scientists from over thirty countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania have gathered in our capital today to participate in the 1966 Summer Physics Discussion Meeting of the Beijing Science Discussion Meeting. On behalf of the Chinese government, the Chinese people, and Chinese scientists, I extend a warm welcome to you all. Your efforts to come to Beijing for this meeting, despite the hardships, demonstrate the support, trust, and friendship of the peoples and scientists of the four continents towards the Chinese people and scientists. We express our heartfelt gratitude.

	This meeting is a single-discipline scientific discussion held on the basis of the 1964 Beijing Science Discussion Meeting. The 1964 Beijing Science Discussion Meeting fully promoted the spirit of democratic consultation, mutual respect, and mutual support. It achieved great success in exchanging academic experiences, exploring the path of scientific development, and promoting the friendship and unity of scientists from various countries. I believe that this Physics Discussion Meeting, with the joint efforts of the representatives from various countries, will continue to uphold this spirit and will definitely achieve complete success.

	Strengthening the unity of the peoples and scientists of the four continents is our common aspiration. In the development of the national and people's scientific undertakings of various countries, the peoples and scientists of the four continents have forged a great and combative friendship. The convening of the 1964 Beijing Science Discussion Meeting further consolidated and developed this friendship. Today, we are holding this single-discipline Physics Discussion Meeting to exchange the scientific research results and experiences of physicists from the four continents. We are pleased to know that the physicists from various countries attending this discussion meeting will present high-level academic papers. This will provide a strong guarantee for the success of this discussion meeting and once again demonstrate our determination to strengthen unity and cooperation among the peoples and scientists of the four continents to develop national and people's science.

	For a long time, imperialism has monopolized science, controlled and strangled the national sciences of various countries, and misused scientific achievements to serve their policies of aggression and war. The peoples and scientists of the four continents, for our common cause, need to strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation. This mutual assistance and cooperation is based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual help, mutual learning, and common progress. Relying on and strengthening this mutual assistance and cooperation, we can break the monopoly and control of imperialism, revive, and prosper the national and people's scientific undertakings of the various countries of the four continents. The peoples of the four continents, some of whom have gone through long struggles to achieve national independence, and others who are fighting fiercely against imperialism and old and new colonialism for national liberation, will definitely be able to catch up with and surpass the Western imperialist countries in developing national science and scaling the heights of world science.

	Friends, comrades! Opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States is the basis for the unity of the peoples of the four continents. The unity of scientists from the four continents is an important component of the anti-imperialist united front of the peoples of the four continents. Undoubtedly, strengthening the unity and cooperation of scientists from the four continents will help promote the common cause of defending world peace and advancing human progress. The Chinese people, following the teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong, have consistently and resolutely opposed imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, and have always stood firmly with the peoples of the four continents. We firmly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. We firmly support the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We firmly support the struggles of the working class and laboring people in capitalist countries in Oceania, Europe, and North America against monopoly capital and their own reactionaries. We firmly support the anti-imperialist patriotic struggles of all countries and peoples oppressed and bullied by American imperialism.

	Friends, comrades! The Chinese people and scientists, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao Zedong's teachings on liberating the mind and breaking superstitions, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to innovate, and dare to make revolution, are resolutely taking their own path in developing their own scientific undertakings; at the same time, they have always followed Chairman Mao Zedong's teachings, seriously and humbly learning from the achievements and advanced experiences of various peoples in science and technology. The convening of this Physics Discussion Meeting provides a good opportunity for our physics community to learn. We will definitely learn well from the scientists of various countries. We are also willing to provide our research results for the reference and discussion of the scientists from various countries attending the meeting. I believe that through mutual exchange and inspiration, we will definitely make new contributions to the development of science and culture in the four continents.

	Now, I propose a toast:

	To the great unity of the peoples and scientists of the four continents,
	To the revival and prosperity of the scientific undertakings of the peoples of the four continents,
	To world peace and human progress,
	To the health of our friends and comrades from various countries,
	Cheers!

    在欢迎北京物理讨论会各国科学家的宴会上
    聂荣臻副总理的讲话
    新华社二十三日讯　聂荣臻副总理在欢迎参加北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会各国科学家宴会上的讲话，全文如下：各位来宾，朋友们、同志们！
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲三十多个国家一百多位物理学家和科学家，今天欢聚在我国首都，参加北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会。我代表中国政府、中国人民和中国科学家，对你们表示热烈的欢迎。你们不辞劳苦来到北京开会，这是四大洲人民和科学家，对中国人民和科学家支持、信任和友好的表现，我们表示衷心的感谢。
    这次会议，是在一九六四年北京科学讨论会的基础上召开的一次单科性的科学讨论会。一九六四年的北京科学讨论会，充分发扬了民主协商、互相尊重、互相支持的精神，在交流学术经验、探讨发展科学道路、促进各国科学家的友谊和团结方面，取得了很大的成就。我相信，这次物理讨论会，在到会的各国代表共同努力下，继续发扬这种精神，一定会获得圆满成功。
    加强四大洲人民和科学家之间的团结，是我们的共同愿望。在发展各国民族的、人民大众的科学事业中，四大洲的人民和科学家已经结成了伟大的、战斗的友谊。一九六四年北京科学讨论会的召开，使这种友谊得到进一步的巩固和发展。今天，我们又举行这个单科性的物理讨论会，交流我们四大洲物理学家科学研究的成果和经验。我们很高兴地知道，出席这次讨论会的各国物理学家，将提出具有高度水平的学术论文。这就为开好这次讨论会，提供了有力的保证，并且再一次显示了我们四大洲人民和科学家加强团结合作，发展民族的、人民大众的科学的决心。
    长期以来，帝国主义一直垄断科学，控制和扼杀各国的民族科学，滥用科学成果为它们侵略政策和战争政策服务。我们四大洲的人民和科学家，为了我们的共同事业，需要大力加强互助合作。这种互助合作，是建立在平等互利、互相帮助、互相学习、共同提高的基础之上的。依靠和加强这种互助合作，就可以打破帝国主义的垄断和控制，复兴和繁荣我们四大洲各国本民族和本国人民的科学事业。我们四大洲人民，有的经过长期斗争，已经取得了民族独立；有的正在为争取民族解放，进行着反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的如火如荼的斗争。越来越多的事实表明，我们四大洲人民，摆脱殖民主义枷锁、获得民族独立以后，在发展民族科学、攀登世界科学高峰方面，一定能够赶上和超过西方帝国主义国家。
    朋友们，同志们！反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，是我们四大洲人民团结的基础。我们四大洲科学家的团结，是四大洲人民反美统一战线的一个重要组成部分。毫无疑问，加强四大洲科学家的团结合作，必将有助于推进保卫世界和平和促进人类进步的共同事业。我国人民遵循毛泽东主席的教导，一贯坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，始终不渝地同四大洲人民站在一起。我们坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。我们坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动。我们坚决支持大洋洲、欧洲和北美洲资本主义国家的工人阶级和劳动人民反对垄断资本和本国反动派的斗争。我们坚决支持一切受美帝国主义侵略和欺负的国家和人民的反美爱国斗争。
    朋友们，同志们！中国人民和科学家，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵循毛泽东主席关于解放思想、破除迷信的教导，敢想、敢说、敢做、敢闯、敢革命，在发展自己的科学事业方面，坚决走自己的道路；同时，也一向遵循毛泽东主席的教导，认真地、虚心地学习各国人民在科学技术上所取得的成果和先进经验。这次物理讨论会的召开，为我国物理学界提供了一个良好的学习机会。我们一定很好地向各国科学家学习，我们也愿意把我们的研究成果提供给到会的各国科学家参考和探讨。我相信，通过相互切磋和相互启发，一定会对我们四大洲的科学文化的发展作出新的贡献。
    现在我提议：
    为四大洲人民和科学家的大团结，
    为四大洲人民科学事业的复兴和繁荣，
    为世界和平和人类进步，
    为各国朋友们、同志们的健康，
    干杯！（附图片）
