Recently, at the meeting of outstanding representatives from the industry, transportation, finance, and commerce sectors held in Jinan, the attendees carefully studied a letter written by Comrade Lin Biao on the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the industrial and transportation sectors. Everyone was deeply moved and inspired. They said: This is a very important document, every sentence strikes a chord in our hearts, and we must resolutely implement it.

Mao Zedong Thought is the unified, revolutionary, and correct thought of our country. Only with Mao Zedong Thought can we have a firm and correct political direction.

The representatives unanimously reflected that Comrade Lin Biao's letter has profound significance and provides great enlightenment and deep education. It is not only written for the industrial and transportation sectors but also calls on the 700 million people of the entire country to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Comrade Lin Biao said in the letter: "Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat with a population of 700 million. We need a unified, revolutionary, and correct thought, which is Mao Zedong Thought. Only with this thought can we maintain vigorous revolutionary spirit and have a firm and correct political direction." The representatives unanimously agreed that Comrade Lin Biao's words are correct and good, fully resonating with the hearts of the workers. The practice of the Chinese revolution and socialist construction, as well as the practice of world revolution, have fully proven that Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of victory, an invincible and unassailable powerful weapon. The history of our country's revolution is the history of the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. In every period and every aspect, wherever Mao Zedong Thought has been upheld, the revolution has achieved continuous victories; wherever Mao Zedong Thought has not been upheld, the revolution has suffered setbacks and failures.

Many representatives used the personal experiences of their factories, shops, teams, and individuals to illustrate that whoever places the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the foremost position of all work, and arms their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, can enhance proletarian consciousness and thus generate tremendous material force. Representative Wang Zikai from the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Plant said: Our factory was originally a car parts plant with poor equipment, low technology, and poor conditions. No one dared to think of manufacturing cars in the past. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "among all things in the world, man is the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created," the workers' minds were armed. Everyone said: "Workers educated by Chairman Mao are made of iron and bone. No matter how great the difficulty, we must produce cars!" They broke through various obstacles set by the bourgeois "authorities," overcame superstitions and rigid frameworks, and finally successfully developed the 8-ton Huanghe brand truck, which is now in mass production.

Comrade Lin Biao's letter states: "Mao Zedong Thought reflects the objective laws of class struggle at home and abroad and reflects the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the laboring people." It also says: "Mao Zedong Thought is the thought that Chairman Mao, based on great revolutionary practice, has brilliantly inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism, summing up the new experiences of the international communist movement, and has raised Marxism-Leninism to a new and higher stage." The representatives repeatedly studied and understood these words of Comrade Lin Biao. They said, Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world. Chairman Mao's books are not only the magic weapon of the Chinese people's revolution but also the magic weapon of liberating all mankind. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most active Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works have great practical significance and profound historical significance for guiding our country's revolution and the world revolution. Representative Zhang Yulan from the Jinan Chengtong Cotton Mill's rear spinning workshop's bobbin car class A team said: Chairman Mao is the helmsman of the world revolution, and all revolutionary people of the world look towards Beijing. The higher we hold the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, the greater the victories we achieve, the greater our contribution to the world revolution, and the sooner we will make imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries perish. Representative Ma Xingyi from the Zaili Coal Mine used the facts of his unit to illustrate the need to place the study of Chairman Mao's works as the first item in the policy of all work. Before 1963, this coal mine did not emphasize the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, focusing only on production and safety, but the production tasks were still not completed. Later, by placing the study of Chairman Mao's works in the foremost position of all work, the ideological transformation of the workers was promoted, the 1965 tasks were completed well, the coal quality reached the national standard, the safety situation improved significantly, and it was rated as an advanced enterprise in Zibo City.

The representatives unanimously reflected that they deeply felt Comrade Lin Biao's pointing out that Mao Zedong Thought is not spontaneously produced by the laboring people. It must be through the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works to infuse Chairman Mao's thoughts into the workers and peasants, transforming them into tremendous material force. They expressed their determination to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their own thoughts, to be forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and to be forever good students of Chairman Mao. Representative Hao Jianxiu from the Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 8 said: I was nurtured by the Party, but because of the burden of being a "born red," I did not study Chairman Mao's works well in the past. To thoroughly transform myself, be loyal to the revolution, and be revolutionary forever, I resolutely follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, treat the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works as the primary compulsory course, the most fundamental basic skill, and a lifelong mission, letting Mao Zedong Thought take root in my mind, and struggle for the Party's cause all my life, never changing. Representative Zhou Xili, a truck driver from the Weifang Automobile Transport Company, said: My family has suffered for generations. I joined the revolution at a young age and was awarded in the army. After being transferred to local work, I was an advanced producer. I deeply feel that a driver must first have a "steering wheel" in his mind. One must use the "steering wheel" in one's mind to control the steering wheel on the car. To keep the "steering wheel" in one's mind steady, one must actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform oneself, and truly become a revolutionary warrior of the proletariat.

After studying, the representatives further recognized that Mao Zedong Thought is the magic weapon for revolution and the fundamental principle for running enterprises well. Socialist enterprises are not only the battlefield for production struggles but more importantly, the battlefield for class struggles. The primary task of socialist enterprises is to use Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate and train a proletarian revolutionary workforce. Only with a revolutionary workforce can there be a revolutionary enterprise, and only then can good products and good economic results be produced. Only with the people of Daqing can there be the Daqing Oil Field; only with the people of Dazhai can there be the Dazhai Fields. Only those armed with Mao Zedong Thought can change the heavens and the earth and transform everything. The representatives unanimously expressed their determination to implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions and run the enterprises as large schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

The representatives expressed that they would definitely play a leading, bridging role in the great task of turning the factory into a large school of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and push the mass movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights.

    山东省工交财贸方面五好代表认真学习林彪同志的信
    决心把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮
    据新华社济南六日电最近在济南举行的山东省工业、交通、财贸方面五好代表会议上，到会代表认真学习了林彪同志就工业交通战线活学活用毛主席著作写的一封信，个个心情激动，人人受到鼓舞和教育。他们说：这是一个极为重要的文件，句句说到我们心坎里，我们一定要坚决贯彻执行。
   毛泽东思想是我国统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想。有了毛泽东思想，才有坚定正确的政治方向
    代表们一致反映：林彪同志的信，意义极其深远，对人启发大，教育深，不仅是给工业交通战线写的，而且也是对全国七亿人民发出的进一步活学活用毛主席著作的号召。林彪同志在信中说：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。有了这个思想，才能保持旺盛的革命干劲，才有坚定正确的政治方向。”代表们一致认为：林彪同志的话说得对，说得好，完全说到职工们的心里了。中国革命和社会主义建设的实践，以及世界革命的实践，都已经完全证明：毛泽东思想是胜利的旗帜，是战无不胜、攻无不克的最强大武器。我国革命胜利的历史就是毛泽东思想胜利的历史。无论那一个时期，那一个方面，凡是坚持了毛泽东思想挂帅，革命就能不断取得胜利；凡是没有坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，革命就要遭到挫折和失败。
    许多代表以本工厂、本商店、本小组和个人亲身经历的事实说明：谁把活学活用毛主席著作放在全部工作的第一位，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，谁就能提高无产阶级觉悟，从而产生巨大的物质力量。济南汽车制造总厂代表王子开说：我们厂原来是个设备简陋、技术低、条件差的汽车配件厂，过去谁也不敢想制造汽车。后来学习了毛主席的“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来”的教导，武装了职工的头脑。大家说：“毛主席教育出来的工人是铁打的硬骨头，有天大的困难，也一定要生产出汽车来！”他们打破了资产阶级“权威”设置的种种障碍，破除迷信和框框，终于试制成功载重八吨的黄河牌汽车，并已大量生产。
  毛主席天才地把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。我们必须把大学毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位
    林彪同志的信中说：“毛泽东思想，反映了国内国际阶级斗争的客观规律，反映了无产阶级、劳动人民的根本利益。”又说：毛泽东思想，是“毛主席在伟大的革命实践基础上天才地继承和发展了马克思列宁主义的思想，是综合了国际共产主义运动的新经验，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。”代表们对林彪同志的这些话，作了反复地学习领会。他们说，毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。毛主席的书，不仅是中国人民革命的法宝，也是解放全人类的法宝。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义。因此，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，对指导我国革命和世界革命都具有伟大的现实意义和深远的历史意义。济南成通棉纺厂后纺车间筒子车甲班一组代表张玉兰说：毛主席是世界革命的舵手，全世界革命人民都向往着北京。我们把毛泽东思想红旗举得越高，取得的胜利越大，对世界革命的贡献就越大，就会使帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派早日完蛋。寨里煤矿代表马兴义以本单位的事实，说明必须把大学毛主席著作做为全部工作方针的第一项。这个煤矿在一九六三年以前，没有大抓活学活用毛主席著作，只抓生产、抓安全，抓来抓去，生产任务还是完不成。后来把大学毛主席著作放在全部工作的第一位，促进了职工的思想革命化，一九六五年任务完成得好，煤炭质量达到了国家规定标准，安全状况大为改善，被评为淄博市的先进企业。
  毛泽东思想并不是劳动人民自发地产生的。必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，转化为巨大的物质力量
    代表们对林彪同志指出的，毛泽东思想并不是劳动人民自发地产生的，必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去这个问题，一致反映感受最深。他们表示，决心用毛泽东思想改造自己的思想，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远做毛主席的好学生。青岛国棉八厂代表郝建秀说：我是在党的培养下长大的，因为背着“自来红”的包袱，过去对毛主席著作学习得不够好。为了彻底改造自己，忠于革命，永远革命，我坚决听从林彪同志的指示，把活学活用毛主席著作，当做首要的必修课，当做最根本的基本功，当做毕生的任务，让毛泽东思想在我的头脑里扎根，为党的事业奋斗一生，永不变色。潍坊汽车运输公司汽车司机周希来说：我家几辈子受苦。我从小参加革命，在部队上立过功。转业做地方工作后，是先进生产者。我深深体会到，一个司机首先必须有个思想上的“方向盘”。要用思想上的“方向盘”指挥汽车上的方向盘。要把稳思想上的“方向盘”，就必须活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想改造自己，使自己真正成为无产阶级的革命战士。
    坚决执行林彪同志的指示，把企业办成毛泽东思想的大学校
    代表们经过学习，进一步认识到，毛泽东思想是干革命的法宝，是办好企业的根本。社会主义企业，不仅是进行生产斗争的阵地，而更重要的是进行阶级斗争的阵地。社会主义企业的首要任务是用毛泽东思想培养和造就无产阶级的革命化的职工队伍，有了革命化的队伍，才能有革命化的企业，才能出好的产品，出好的经济效果。有了大庆人，才有大庆油田；有了大寨人，才有大寨田。只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，才能改天换地，改造一切。代表们一致表示：坚决贯彻执行林彪同志的指示，把企业办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    代表们纷纷表示：一定要在把工厂办成毛泽东思想的大学校的伟大任务中，起骨干、带头、桥梁作用，大力宣传毛泽东思想，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的高潮。
