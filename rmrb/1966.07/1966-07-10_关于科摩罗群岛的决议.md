    关于科摩罗群岛的决议
    自一九六六年六月二十七日至七月九日在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议，在听取了科摩罗群岛民族解放运动代表团所做的关于科摩罗人民反对法国殖民主义的斗争的报告之后，
    ——承认科摩罗群岛民族解放运动是科摩罗人民的真正代言者；
    ——支持科摩罗人民的解放斗争；
    ——强烈谴责法国在群岛进行的惨无人道和反民主的活动，以及它不准科摩罗群岛人民为争取独立而进行政治活动的作法；
    ——请求亚非作家对科摩罗群岛民族解放运动所进行的解放斗争给予一切精神与物质援助；
    ——要求法国政府承认科摩罗群岛人民为争取群岛的政治、经济和社会的发展而建立政治组织与群众组织这一当然的不可剥夺的权利。
