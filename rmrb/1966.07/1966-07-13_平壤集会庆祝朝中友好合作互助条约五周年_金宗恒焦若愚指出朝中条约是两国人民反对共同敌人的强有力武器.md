	Pyongyang held a gathering on the evening of July 11 to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-North Korean Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance Treaty. Kim Jong-hyun and Jiao Ruoju pointed out that the treaty is a powerful weapon for the two countries' peoples to oppose their common enemy.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 12: On the evening of July 11, the workers of Pyongyang held a gathering to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-North Korean Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance Treaty.

	Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Pak Kum-chol, Vice Premier Li Chu-yuan, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pak Sung-chol, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly Paek Nam-un, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Sino-North Korean Friendship Association and Minister of Higher Education Kim Jong-hyun, Minister of Posts Pak Yong-chun, Chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal People's Committee Kang Hae-won, Lieutenant General Choe Chong-hyon of the Korean People's Army, and leaders of various social organizations attended the meeting.

	Chinese Ambassador to North Korea Jiao Ruoju and diplomatic officials from the embassy, as well as Chinese experts and students in Pyongyang, were also invited to attend the meeting.

	Kim Jong-hyun said in his speech that the Sino-North Korean Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance Treaty further consolidates and develops the friendship and cooperative relationship between the two peoples that has been formed over a long historical period. It is a reliable guarantee for safeguarding the security and socialist achievements of the two countries and maintaining peace in Asia, and a serious warning to imperialist aggressors.

	Kim Jong-hyun condemned the increasingly blatant aggressive activities of American imperialism around the world. He pointed out that American imperialism is turning South Korea into its colony and military base for invading Asia. American imperialism is occupying Taiwan, an inseparable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China. Under the protection of American imperialism, the revived Japanese militarists, harboring the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," are brazenly taking the road of re-invading Asia.

	Kim Jong-hyun condemned the American imperialist bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, saying that this is a new and dangerous step in the "gradual escalation" of the aggression against Vietnam.

	Kim Jong-hyun said that the peoples of the two countries will stop and smash the imperialists' aggressive and war plots, and closely cooperate with each other in the struggle for the victory of the common cause of peace and socialism.

	Ambassador Jiao Ruoju said in his speech that the Sino-North Korean Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance Treaty is a powerful weapon for our two peoples to oppose our common enemy and a security guarantee for each of our countries to build socialism.

	He said that the Chinese government and people have always firmly supported the North Korean government and people's just stance against American imperialism and for the reunification of the fatherland, and firmly supported the anti-American patriotic struggle of the South Korean people.

	Ambassador Jiao Ruoju condemned the recent continuous bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by American imperialism and expressed the determination of the Chinese people to do their utmost to support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people until their anti-American national salvation struggle achieves final victory.

	He pointed out that it is necessary to resolutely oppose modern revisionism in order to successfully oppose American imperialism and to form the broadest and most genuine international anti-American united front, not a narrow and hypocritical one.

	Ambassador Jiao Ruoju finally said that the friendship and unity between the peoples of the two countries are forged in blood and are based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. It can withstand any storm and cannot be destroyed by any reactionary forces. The Chinese people will forever stand together with the brotherly Korean people to fight to the end against the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism and to defend our common security.

    据新华社平壤十二日电　平壤市劳动人民十一日晚举行集会，庆祝朝中友好合作互助条约签订五周年。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴金喆，内阁副首相李周渊，外务相朴成哲，最高人民会议常任委员会副委员长白南云，朝中友好协会中央委员会委员长、高等教育相金宗恒，递信相朴永淳，平壤市人民委员会委员长姜希源，朝鲜人民军少将崔钟健以及各社会团体负责人出席了大会。
    中国驻朝鲜大使焦若愚和大使馆外交官员以及在平壤的中国专家、留学生也应邀出席了大会。
    金宗恒在讲话中说，朝中友好合作互助条约进一步巩固和发展了两国人民经过长期历史时期形成的友谊和合作关系。它是保卫两国安全和社会主义成果、维护亚洲和平的可靠保证，是对帝国主义侵略者的严重警告。
    金宗恒谴责美帝国主义越来越露骨地在世界各地进行侵略活动。他指出，美帝国主义正在把南朝鲜变成它的殖民地和侵略亚洲的军事基地。美帝国主义霸占着中华人民共和国不可分割的领土台湾。在美帝国主义庇护下重新复活的日本军国主义者，怀着实现“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦，明目张胆地走上重新侵略亚洲的道路。
    金宗恒谴责美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防的暴行说，这是在侵略越南战争“逐步升级”中迈出的新的危险的一步。
    金宗恒说，朝中两国人民将制止和粉碎帝国主义者的侵略和战争阴谋活动，在争取和平和社会主义共同事业胜利的斗争中相互紧密合作前进。
    焦若愚大使在讲话中说，中朝友好合作互助条约，是我们两国人民反对我们共同敌人的强有力的武器，是我们两国各自建设社会主义的安全保障。
    他说，中国政府和中国人民一向坚决支持朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义，统一祖国的严正立场，坚决支持南朝鲜人民的反美爱国斗争。
    焦若愚大使谴责了美帝国主义最近连续轰炸河内和海防的滔天罪行，并表达了中国人民将竭尽全力支持越南人民的正义斗争，直到他们的抗美救国斗争取得最后胜利的决心。
    他指出，必须坚决地反对现代修正主义才能胜利地反对美帝国主义，必须结成最广泛而不是狭隘的、最真实而不是虚伪的国际反美统一战线。
    焦若愚大使最后说，中朝两国人民的友谊和团结，是用鲜血凝成的，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的，它是经得起任何风浪考验的，是任何反动力量所破坏不了的。中国人民将和兄弟的朝鲜人民永远团结在一起，为反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，捍卫我们两国的共同安全而奋斗到底。
