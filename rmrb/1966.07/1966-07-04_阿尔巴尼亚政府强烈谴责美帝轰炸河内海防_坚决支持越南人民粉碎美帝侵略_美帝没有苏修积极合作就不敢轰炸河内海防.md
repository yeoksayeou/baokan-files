Albanian Government Strongly Condemns U.S. Bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong
Firmly Supports Vietnamese People in Smashing U.S. Aggression
U.S. Would Not Dare Bomb Hanoi and Haiphong Without Active Cooperation of Soviet Revisionists

Tirana, July 2 (New China News Agency) — The Albanian People's Republic government issued a statement on July 2 strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' heinous crime of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, and firmly supporting the Vietnamese people's just struggle.

The statement said, the U.S. imperialists are attempting, through this savage bombing and this vicious crime, to intimidate the Vietnamese people, make them kneel, and force them to the so-called peace talks, seeking to obtain through the "peaceful" path what they cannot get on the battlefield. The U.S. imperialists' evil deeds once again expose their true colors as the sworn enemies of the freedom and independence of all peoples and of peace.

The statement pointed out: "In this conspiracy against the heroic Vietnamese people, U.S. imperialism is actively relying on U.S.-Soviet collaboration. Without this collaboration, the U.S. imperialists would not only not dare to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong but would not even dare to stay on Vietnamese soil for a single day."

The statement pointed out: "The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people has already shattered the myth of the invincibility of the biggest imperialist country, the United States, and the myth, propagated by the lackeys of imperialism, that modern weapons are all-powerful."

The statement said, the heroic Vietnamese people are indomitable. They are waging a glorious, exemplary, and inspiring just struggle and have earned the love, respect, and admiration of the peoples of the world. The brave Vietnamese people, both in the North and the South, who love freedom, are ready to make any sacrifice and have already given the U.S. aggressors the punishment they deserve. They are fighting more heroically and selflessly to smash the aggression and achieve final victory. The blackmail, pressure, and savage crimes committed by the U.S. imperialists have never frightened the heroic Vietnamese people and the revolutionary peoples of the world. On the contrary, they have only aroused their anger, indignation, and hatred against the U.S. imperialists to a greater extent and have greatly expanded the struggle of the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism.

The statement emphasized: "The Albanian people and the Albanian People's Republic government express their extreme indignation and strongly condemn the new dangerous moves of the U.S. government to expand its aggression against Vietnam and Southeast Asia. The Albanian people have always regarded, and will continue to regard, the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people for liberation against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys as their own struggle. The Albanian people have always supported, and will continue to support, the glorious Vietnamese people with all their might until they defeat the U.S. aggressors and achieve final victory. The Albanian People's Republic government reiterates that the only correct way to solve the Vietnamese question is to realize the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam."

The statement strongly protests against the crimes of U.S. imperialism and expresses warm and firm support to the fraternal Vietnamese people. The statement concludes by expressing its complete belief that the sacred struggle of the Vietnamese people will be victorious and that the U.S. imperialists will be defeated.

    阿尔巴尼亚政府强烈谴责美帝轰炸河内海防
    坚决支持越南人民粉碎美帝侵略
    美帝没有苏修积极合作就不敢轰炸河内海防
    新华社地拉那二日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府二日发表声明，强烈谴责美国轰炸河内和海防的滔天罪行，坚决支持越南人民的正义斗争。
    声明说，美帝国主义者妄图通过这种野蛮的轰炸、通过这种凶恶的罪行来恫吓越南人民，使他们屈膝并迫使他们走到所谓和谈的会议桌旁，妄图通过“和平途径”取得他们在战场上得不到的东西。美帝国主义者的恶毒行径再一次暴露了他们是各国人民的自由与独立以及和平的死敌的真面目。
    声明指出：“在针对英雄的越南人民的这一阴谋中，美帝国主义积极依靠苏美合作。没有这种合作，美帝国主义者就会不仅不敢轰炸河内和海防，而且甚至一天也不会赖在越南土地上。”
    声明指出：“越南人民的英勇斗争已经破除了最大的帝国主义国家美国不可战胜的神话，破除了帝国主义的仆从们大肆宣扬的关于现代化武器置人于死地的神话。”
    声明说，英雄的越南人民是压不倒的，他们正在进行一场光荣的、堪称典范的、鼓舞人心的正义斗争，并且得到了世界各国人民的热爱、尊敬和钦佩。越南北方和南方的热爱自由的勇敢的越南人民不惜作出任何牺牲，已经给予美帝国主义侵略者以应得的回击，他们正更加英勇和奋不顾身地进行着战斗，以粉碎侵略和争取最后的胜利。美帝国主义者进行的讹诈、施加的压力和犯下的野蛮罪行从来就吓不倒英雄的越南人民和世界各国的革命人民，恰恰相反，只是更加激起了他们对美帝国主义者的愤怒、愤慨和痛恨，在很大程度上扩大了各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    声明强调说，“阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府对美国政府为了扩大对越南和对东南亚的侵略而采取的新的危险行径，表示无比愤怒，强烈地予以谴责。阿尔巴尼亚人民过去和现在，一向把兄弟越南人民为反对美帝国主义及其走狗所进行的可歌可泣的解放斗争看作是自己的斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民过去、现在和将来都全力支持光荣的越南人民，直到打败美国侵略者而取得最后胜利。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府重申，解决越南问题的唯一正确的途径就是实现越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明中提出的要求。”
    声明坚决抗议美帝国主义者的罪行，并向兄弟越南人民表示热诚和坚决的支持。声明最后表示完全相信，越南人民的神圣斗争必胜，美帝国主义者必败。
