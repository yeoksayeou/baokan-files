A farce centered in Moscow to promote the U.S. imperialists' peace talks conspiracy
Indian Prime Minister and British Prime Minister successively visit the Soviet Union to conspire with Soviet leaders to convene a Geneva Conference
Johnson and others shout for Soviet leaders to "seize the opportunity" to carry out the peace talks deception

New China News Agency, July 19th: Our correspondent reports: At the invitation of the Soviet government, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi visited the Soviet Union from July 12th to 16th and held talks with Soviet leaders on the issue of convening a Geneva Conference. This is an important part of the recent activities centered in Moscow to promote the U.S. imperialists' "bombing to force peace" conspiracy.

Soviet-Indian Conspiracy, Birds of a Feather
According to reports, during Gandhi's visit to the Soviet Union, Soviet leaders Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others held multiple talks with her on the Vietnam issue and other international issues. The "Soviet-Indian Joint Statement" issued on the 16th said that the two sides' views on a large number of international issues "are consistent or close." This statement does not condemn the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, completely ignores the fact that the U.S. has thoroughly torn up the Geneva Agreement, and fully follows the U.S. tune to advocate that "only within the scope of the 1954 Geneva Agreement on Indochina can a solution to the Vietnam problem be found." The statement does not propose that the U.S. should immediately stop its aggression against the entire Vietnam and withdraw all its troops of aggression from South Vietnam, nor does it mention supporting the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Instead, it maliciously says that "immediate cessation of bombing against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam." It does not oppose the U.S. policy of aggression, nor does it distinguish between just and unjust wars, putting the Vietnamese people and other anti-aggression peoples on an equal footing with the U.S. imperialists, talking about so-called "opposition to all attempts to exacerbate international tensions," and demanding that "all governments abandon the use of force." The statement fully exposes that the leaders of the Soviet Union and India are birds of a feather, attempting to make the Vietnamese people abandon the use of force to resist U.S. armed aggression, abandon the revolution, and kneel in surrender.

U.S. Pulling Strings from Behind the Scenes
Gandhi's visit to the Soviet Union was entirely directed by the Washington ruling clique. According to the Indian weekly "Blitz" on July 9th, before Gandhi's visit to the Soviet Union, the U.S. had "once again contacted the Indian Prime Minister," expressing that the U.S. "hopes to find some way to stop the Vietnam War without giving up its basic position," that is, continuing to occupy South Vietnam. To meet this U.S. need, Gandhi put forward the so-called "seven-point proposal for peace in Vietnam" in New Delhi on July 7th, calling for the "reconvening of the Geneva Conference" to discuss the Vietnam issue. Before publicly proposing this proposal, she had informed Washington and obtained U.S. approval. On the day after she publicly put forward the seven-point proposal (July 8th), the U.S. rewarded India with a $150 million loan. Before this, the Soviet revisionist leadership had already agreed to lend India about 1 billion rubles, rewarding Gandhi for her active anti-China stance and for her schemes to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression.

Gandhi carried her seven-point proposal to Cairo on July 8th and 9th for talks with Egyptian President Nasser, and then to Yugoslavia on July 10th to 12th for secret consultations with Tito, the U.S. imperialists' lackey. On July 12th, she hurried from Yugoslavia to Moscow by plane. Western news agencies reported that before and after Gandhi's visit to the Soviet Union, U.S. President Johnson and Secretary of State Rusk repeatedly shouted for Soviet leaders to "seize the opportunity," "fulfill the responsibilities of the chairman of the Geneva Conference," and "directly and responsibly work to create peace in (Vietnam)," to help the U.S. carry out the "peace talks" deception.

The so-called "peaceful solution" to the Vietnam problem proposed by the Indian Prime Minister to coordinate with the U.S. "peace talks" deception is so blatant that in the "Soviet-Indian Joint Statement" and in the speeches made by Soviet leaders during Gandhi's visit to the Soviet Union, they did not dare to directly mention this proposal. However, the Soviet authorities actually took a positive stance on India's proposal. On the 14th, Soviet Premier Kosygin, in his speech at the "Soviet-Indian Friendship Meeting" in Moscow, praised "India's active participation in solving world problems." On the 16th, Kosygin, in a press conference in Moscow, also said that the Soviet-Indian sides "jointly believe that we should do everything we can to prevent war." According to the United Press International, when the Indian Prime Minister returned to New Delhi on the 17th, she told reporters that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Indian government's proposal was "not negative." The "Indian Times" reporter reported from Moscow on the 13th that the Soviet government "definitely welcomes early negotiations," but it does not want to "make public statements on this issue at present."

Indian Prime Minister's Anti-China Stance in the Soviet Union
During the Indian Prime Minister's visit to the Soviet Union, the Soviet leaders also provided various occasions for her to openly attack China. On July 15th, Gandhi, in her speech at the reception held by the Soviet government for her, insinuated that China "forgot the commitments it signed in Bandung and rejected peaceful coexistence," and "attempted to exacerbate tensions to justify its dogmatic belief in the inevitability of war and the use of force to solve problems." The day before (July 14th), she also publicly named and insinuated attacks on China in her speech at the "Soviet-Indian Friendship Meeting," saying that China had carried out "military aggression" against India, etc. At this time, the leaders Brezhnev and Kosygin sitting on the podium of the meeting applauded her anti-China clamor, openly expressing their approval.

The Soviet authorities invited the Indian Prime Minister to visit the Soviet Union, conspired with her to serve the U.S. imperialists' "bombing to force peace" conspiracy, and openly expressed their approval of her public anti-China stance. This is another major exposure of the treacherous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership, who pretend to be anti-imperialist but are actually surrendering, pretend to support but actually betray, and pretend to unite but actually split.

New China News Agency, July 19th: Moscow: Following Indian Prime Minister Gandhi's visit, British Prime Minister Wilson, at the invitation of Soviet Premier Kosygin, visited Moscow for three days. After secret consultations with Kosygin on the Vietnam issue, he left Moscow for his country on the 19th. This is another farce centered in Moscow to serve the U.S. "bombing to force peace" conspiracy.

U.S. Orchestrates British-Soviet Secret Talks
Wilson's visit to Moscow was hastily arranged after the U.S. heavily bombed Hanoi and Haiphong. Before leaving London on the 16th, Wilson had clearly stated that he was going to discuss the Vietnam issue. According to reports, his proposals to Moscow included: "reconvening the Geneva Conference," "strengthening" the so-called "International Control Commission," and using it as another "pathway" for "peace testers." Before going to the Soviet Union, he had conducted "full consultations" with U.S. President Johnson.

During his three-day visit to Moscow, Wilson held a series of intense and frequent talks with Kosygin. On the 18th alone, the two sides' talks lasted a total of seven hours. According to reports, they discussed the Vietnam issue for most of the time, "secretly discussed all aspects of the Vietnam situation." That evening, Kosygin and Wilson had another two-hour "face-to-face," "only with interpreters present" secret talk, during which they conducted "the most intimate exchange of views," "talking in unusually detailed manner."

The Soviet revisionist leadership, fearing exposure of their collusion with the British government to serve the U.S. "bombing to force peace" conspiracy, had the head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Press Department, Zamiyakin, hold an "unusual" midnight press conference on the evening of the 18th, hyping up the supposed "differences" between the Soviet and British positions on the Vietnam issue. However, people noticed that this Soviet Foreign Ministry official did not express whether the Soviet Union opposed the U.S.-planned deception to force the heroic Vietnamese people to surrender. Instead, he talked about demanding that the U.S. aggressors "respect" the Geneva Agreement, which they had already thoroughly torn up.

According to Western news agencies on the 18th, citing "British sources" in Moscow, "British officials seemed satisfied with the outcome of the talks," these sources said that Wilson had "closer contacts" with Kosygin and had a "deep understanding" of the Soviet Union's attitude towards East-West relations. It was revealed that the two sides also discussed the German issue, European security, and the prevention of nuclear proliferation during their talks.

　　一幕以莫斯科为中心推销美帝和谈阴谋的丑剧
　　印度总理和英国首相接连访苏同苏联领导人策划召开日内瓦会议
　　约翰逊等叫嚷要苏联领导人“抓住机会”推行和谈骗局
    新华社十九日讯　本社记者报道：应苏联政府的邀请，印度总理英迪拉·甘地夫人在七月十二日到十六日访问了苏联，同苏联领导人就策划召开日内瓦会议问题举行了会谈。这是最近以莫斯科为中心推行美帝国主义“以炸迫和”的阴谋活动的一个重要组成部分。
    苏印合谋一丘之貉
    据报道，在印度总理访苏期间，苏联领导人勃列日涅夫、柯西金等，曾同她就越南问题和其他国际问题，多次举行会谈。十六日发表的“苏印联合公报”说，双方“对大量的国际问题的观点是吻合的或接近的”。这个公报通篇不谴责美国对越南的侵略，根本不顾美国早就彻底撕毁了日内瓦协议这一事实，完全按照美国的腔调鼓吹“只有在一九五四年关于印度支那的日内瓦协议的范围内才能找到解决越南问题的办法”。公报根本没有提出美国应立即停止对整个越南的侵略，立即从南越撤出它的全部侵略军队，也根本不提支持越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，而是别有用心地说什么“立即停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸”。它不反对美国的侵略政策，也不区别正义战争和非正义战争，把越南人民和其他反侵略的人民同美帝国主义者放在同等地位，大谈所谓“反对各种目的在于加剧国际紧张局势的企图”，要“所有的政府放弃使用武力”。公报完全暴露了苏印两国领导人完全是一丘之貉，他们妄图使越南人民放弃用武力反对美国的武装侵略，放弃革命，屈膝投降。
    美国幕后一手操纵
    甘地夫人这次访问苏联完全是华盛顿统治集团一手导演的。据印度《闪电》周刊七月九日报道说，在甘地夫人这次访苏之前，美国曾“再一次同印度总理联系”，表示美国“希望在不放弃它的基本立场”，即继续霸占南越的情况下，“寻找某种解决办法来制止越南战争”。适应美国的这一需要，甘地夫人于七月七日在新德里抛出了所谓在越南实现“和平”的七点建议，要求重新“召开日内瓦会议”，讨论越南问题。在公开提出这个建议以前，她曾把这个建议告诉了华盛顿，得到了美国的许诺。在她公开抛出七点建议的第二天
  （七月八日），美国就赏给印度一亿五千万美元的贷款作为酬劳。在这以前，苏联修正主义领导集团已经答应给印度约十亿卢布的贷款，嘉奖甘地夫人积极反华和为扑灭越南人民的抗美救国斗争的革命怒火出谋献策。
    甘地夫人带着她的七点建议，在七月八日至九日到开罗同阿联总统纳赛尔举行了会谈，十日到十二日到南斯拉夫同美帝国主义的走狗铁托作了密商。七月十二日，她又从南斯拉夫乘飞机匆匆赶到莫斯科。西方通讯社的消息透露，在甘地夫人访苏前后，美国总统约翰逊和国务卿腊斯克等不断叫嚷，要苏联领导人“抓住机会”，“履行日内瓦会议主席的职责”，“负责地、直接地致力于（在越南）缔造和平的工作”，以帮助美国推行“和谈”骗局。
    印度总理为配合美国“和谈”骗局而提出的所谓“和平解决”越南问题的七点建议是如此露骨，因此在“苏印联合公报”中，以及苏联领导人在甘地夫人访苏期间公开发表的谈话中，都不敢直接提到这个建议。然而，苏联当局对印度的建议实际上是采取积极支持的立场的。十四日，苏联部长会议主席柯西金在莫斯科举行的“苏印友好大会”上讲话时，就赞赏“印度正积极地参加解决世界问题”。十六日，柯西金在莫斯科举行的一次记者招待会上也说，苏印双方“共同认为，我们应尽我们所能作的一切来防止战争”。据合众国际社报道，印度总理十七日回到新德里时曾对记者说，苏联对印度政府的建议所采取的态度“并不是否定的”。《印度时报》记者十三日自莫斯科报道苏印会谈时也说，“苏联政府肯定欢迎早日举行谈判”，但是它目前不想“就这个问题公开发表意见”。
    印度总理在苏反华
    在印度总理访苏期间，苏联领导人还为她提供各种场合，让她放肆地攻击中国。七月十五日，甘地夫人在苏联政府为她举行的招待会上讲话时，含沙射影地诬蔑中国“忘记了它在万隆所签过字的保证，并且拒绝和平共处”，“企图加剧紧张，以便为它们的战争是不可避免的和使用侵略力量来解决问题的教条主义信念辩解”。在这前一天（十四日），她在“苏印友好大会”上讲话时也多次公开指名和影射攻击中国，说什么中国对印度进行了“军事侵略”等等。这时，坐在大会主席台上的领导人勃列日涅夫和柯西金竟为她的反华叫嚣带头鼓掌，公开表示赞扬。
    苏联当局邀请印度总理访苏，同她一起密谋为美帝国主义“以炸迫和”阴谋效劳，并对她的公开反华表示赞许，这是苏联修正主义领导集团假反帝、真投降，假支持、真出卖，假团结、真分裂的叛徒面目的又一次大暴露。
    新华社十九日讯　莫斯科消息：继印度总理甘地夫人之后，英国首相威尔逊应苏联部长会议主席柯西金的邀请，在莫斯科进行了三天访问。他同柯西金就越南问题进行了秘密磋商后，在十九日离莫斯科回国。这是又一幕以莫斯科为中心替美国“以炸迫和”阴谋效劳的丑剧。
    美国牵线英苏密谈
    威尔逊的莫斯科之行是在美国大肆轰炸河内和海防之后匆匆安排的。威尔逊在十六日离开伦敦前曾经明确表示，他是去谈越南问题的。据报道，他带到莫斯科的建议中有：重新“召开日内瓦会议”、“加强”所谓“国际监督委员会”，把它作为“和平试探者”的另一条“途径”。他在去苏联以前，曾经和美国总统约翰逊进行了“充分的磋商”。
    威尔逊在访问莫斯科的三天中，同柯西金进行了一系列的紧张而频繁的会谈。单是在十八日白天，双方的会谈前后共持续七小时之久。据报道，他们大部分时间谈了越南问题，“密谈了越南局势的一切方面”。当天晚上，柯西金和威尔逊又进行了两小时“面对面的”、“仅有译员在场”的“密谈”，就在这时进行了“最亲密的意见交换”，“谈得不寻常的详细”。
    苏联修正主义领导集团作贼心虚，为了掩饰他们勾结英国政府为美国的
  “以炸迫和”的阴谋效劳，由苏联外交部新闻司司长扎米亚京出面，在十八日晚间举行了一次被路透社记者称之为“异乎寻常的”深夜记者招待会，大肆渲染什么苏英双方对越南问题的立场“不同”。但是，人们注意到，这位苏联外交部官员丝毫没有表示苏联是否反对美国策划的诱使英雄的越南人民屈膝投降的“和平”阴谋。他却大谈要美国侵略者“尊重”早已被他们自己彻底撕毁了的日内瓦协议。
    据西方通讯社十八日援引在莫斯科的“英国人士”的话说，“英国官员看来对这次会谈结果感到满意”，这些人士说，威尔逊“同柯西金有更密切的‘联系’，并且‘深刻地’了解苏联对东西方的态度”。据透露，双方在会谈中还讨论了德国问题、欧洲安全和防止核扩散等问题。
