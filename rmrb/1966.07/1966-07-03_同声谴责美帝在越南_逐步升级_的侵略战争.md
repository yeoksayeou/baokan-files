	Yesterday, representatives from various countries at the emergency conference of Asian and African writers unanimously condemned U.S. imperialism's war policy and aggression policy, opposing its "step-by-step escalation" of aggression in Vietnam.

	At today's meeting, many representatives, in their speeches, demonstrated the revolutionary spirit of Asian and African peoples who dare to struggle and dare to win. They greatly boosted the morale of Asian and African peoples and struck a heavy blow to the arrogance of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The representatives pointed out that the victories of the Vietnamese people and the people of various countries show that U.S. imperialism is merely a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. The true strength does not lie with imperialism but with the people who dare to struggle. Once the people unite, take up arms, and resolutely fight, they will surely achieve victory.

	The representatives also emphasized that the struggles of the people of various countries once again prove that revolutionary violence must be used to counter imperialism and colonialism's violence.

	In their speeches, the representatives also condemned the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union for acting as accomplices of U.S. imperialism and for plotting to hold the Cairo split meeting, thereby sabotaging the Asian and African writers' movement.

	At the morning session today, Niger representative Souley Amadou, amidst warm applause, stepped onto the stage and enthusiastically recited a poem dedicated to Chairman Mao by the Niger delegation to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. Before reciting, he said: "Forty-five years ago, the Communist Party of China was born in Shanghai, on Chinese soil that was oppressed and exploited by imperialists from various countries, under extremely difficult conditions for the national liberation movement. Due to the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has undergone tremendous changes. The birth of New China is a great event. We, the Niger delegation, want to pay tribute to Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China on behalf of the fighting people. Without you, there would be no New China!"

	Amidst the continuous applause of all the representatives, he recited passionately: "Mao Zedong, you are our teacher, Mao Zedong, you are our beacon, illuminating the darkest and most distant horizons brightly. The people, nations, and the entire continent there, in order to live happily in honor and joy, have always sought your radiance and your wise thoughts."

	When he finished reciting, the entire audience stood up and gave thunderous applause, expressing their sincere and enthusiastic congratulations to the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

	At today's meeting, many representatives spoke highly of Chairman Mao in their speeches.

	At the end of the morning session, the presiding chairman, Indonesian representative Risagada, said at the meeting: "Mao Zedong's path is the path of the Asian and African peoples, and it is also the path of all the people of the world."

	The representative from Guinea gave a report at today's meeting. Representatives from Jordan, Niger, Japan, Somalia, Congo (Brazzaville), the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Madagascar, the Somali Coast, Southwest Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, and other countries (regions) also spoke at the meeting. (Summaries of speeches by representatives from various countries can be found on the sixth page of today's issue.)

	At today's conference, a congratulatory message from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions was read.

	The conference also read a statement from the Secretariat of the Asian and African Journalists Association. The statement strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' crime of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong in Vietnam and warmly celebrated the victory of the Vietnamese military and people in striking down the enemy planes.

	The presiding chairpersons for the morning session were representatives from Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Swaziland, and Tanzania. The presiding chairpersons for the afternoon session were representatives from Japan, Jordan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Uganda, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
