	XINHUA, ZANZIBAR — On the eve of the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, Sayyid Bakari, Deputy Chairman of the Youth Department of the Afro-Shirazi Party of Zanzibar, told a Xinhua correspondent here: "Chairman Mao's cause and works belong not only to China but are of great help to all oppressed peoples."

	He said that studying China's experience in revolutionary struggle and construction is the task of revolutionary countries.

	Bakari said, "We cherish Chairman Mao's teachings." He said that Chairman Mao has successfully led 700 million Chinese people to liberate their country and, through self-reliance, has turned China into a socialist country. Therefore, all the youth of Zanzibar understand and highly evaluate his revolutionary cause. At the same time, oppressed workers and peasants all over the world cherish and will forever remember his cause.

	Bakari said that due to Chairman Mao's cause and struggle, many Zanzibar youth love to read his works. He said: "I have read many of his works. Many Zanzibar youth have also read many of his works. They strive to understand the essence of his works, learn and practice, and make themselves more advanced."

	Bakari went on to say that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, some tasks proposed by Marxism-Leninism have been realized in China. He emphasized: "Everything Chairman Mao has done is for the interests of the workers and peasants."

	This young leader, who participated in leading the Zanzibar armed revolution of January 1964, said when talking about Chairman Mao's famous thesis of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun": "The people of Zanzibar will never forget this. Because Zanzibar, like all other brother countries that have liberated themselves through armed force, has obtained liberation through the gun."

	According to Xinhua, Dares Salaam — Werner Mamugwe, Secretary for Pan-African and Foreign Affairs of the South West Africa People's Organization, recently told a Xinhua correspondent here: "Chairman Mao's works have great significance for the working class and peoples still living under the yoke of foreign rule and oppression." He said, "For us who are fighting against colonialism and foreign slavery, Chairman Mao's works are a source of endless courage."

	He said that Chairman Mao's works "make us understand the current world situation in this era of sharp contradictions between international imperialism and the people," "thereby arming us to correctly fight against the erroneous and poisonous propaganda of so-called 'peaceful coexistence'." He said, "By studying Chairman Mao's works 'On Practice' and 'On Contradiction,' we can clearly understand the contradictions between the oppressed and the oppressors."

	He said that Chairman Mao's works "are written in plain language and are profound in meaning, and many people can read and understand them." He said that the cadres of the South West Africa People's Organization are studying Mao Zedong's precious works to solve the problems they encounter in their daily lives.

	He said that the people of South West Africa will definitely defeat imperialism.

    新华社桑给巴尔电  桑给巴尔非洲—设拉子党青年部副主席赛义夫·巴卡里在中国共产党成立四十五周年前夕在这里对新华社记者说：“毛主席的事业和著作不仅是属于中国的，而且对所有被压迫的人民是巨大的帮助。”
    他说，研究中国在革命斗争和建设方面的经验，是革命的国家的任务。
    巴卡里说：“我们珍视毛主席的教导。”他说，毛主席胜利地领导七亿中国人民解放了他们的国家，使中国通过自力更生变成社会主义国家，所以全体桑给巴尔青年都了解和高度评价他的革命事业。同时，全世界受压迫的工人和农民也都珍视和永远记住他的事业。
    巴卡里说，由于毛主席所从事的事业和进行的斗争，许多桑给巴尔青年都爱读他的著作。他说：我读了他的很多著作。许多桑给巴尔青年也读了他的很多著作。他们努力了解他的著作中的实质内容，一边学习，一边实践，使自己变得更加先进。”
    巴卡里接着说，由于毛主席和中国共产党的领导，马克思列宁主义所提出的某些任务在中国已经实现。他强调指出：“毛主席所做的一切都是为了工人和农民的利益。”
    这位曾经参加领导桑给巴尔一九六四年一月武装革命的青年领袖在谈到毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”的著名论断时说：“我们桑给巴尔人民永远不会忘记这一点。因为桑给巴尔象所有其他通过武装力量解放自己的兄弟国家一样，是用枪杆子得到解放的。”
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　西南非洲民族联盟泛非和外交事务书记韦尔纳·马穆格韦最近在这里对新华社记者说：“毛主席的著作对于仍然生活在外国统治和压迫的枷锁下的工人阶级和各国人民，具有伟大的意义。”他说，“对于正在为反对殖民主义和外国奴役而斗争的我们来说，毛主席的著作是我们获得无穷勇气的源泉。”
    他说，毛主席的著作“使我们懂得了在国际帝国主义和人民之间存在着尖锐矛盾的这个时代中的当前世界局势”，“从而武装了我们，使我们能够正确地同所谓‘和平共处’这种错误的有毒的宣传进行斗争”。他说，“学习了毛主席的著作《实践论》和《矛盾论》，我们就能够清楚地了解被压迫者和压迫者之间的矛盾”。
    他说，毛主席的著作“写得通俗易懂，而且含义深刻，许多人都能看懂和了解”。他说，西南非洲民族联盟的干部正在学习毛泽东的珍贵著作，来解决他们日常碰到的问题。
    他说，西南非洲人民一定能够战胜帝国主义。
