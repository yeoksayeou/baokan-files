A Great Revolutionary Warrior - Message from South Vietnam

Dear Comrade!

In the stories of the South Vietnamese struggle that you have read, you must remember the hero who used his body to block the gun port, Zhu Wenqiao! I am now in the dense forest near the Saigon River in Tuyen Duc Province, South Vietnam, visiting the heroic unit where Zhu Wenqiao was once stationed. "One person falls, ten thousand stand up." Zhu Wenqiao's revolutionary heroism has greatly inspired the unit, prompting me to write down everything I have seen and heard here with an excited heart and share it with you!

Zhu Wenqiao sacrificed himself on October 18, 1963, during the attack on the Cai Long outpost. In this unit, everyone praises Zhu Wenqiao's heroic deeds. His name is like a bird with wings, flying over the mountains and plains of South Vietnam, entering the hearts of all the soldiers. Here, I met many of Zhu Wenqiao's former comrades, including the commander of the Cai Long battle, now the battalion commander Wu Zetong, Zhu Wenqiao's fellow villager and deputy platoon leader Yang Faxian, who fought alongside him for over a year, the platoon leader Pan Jincheng, who trained in reconnaissance with Zhu Wenqiao before the Cai Long battle, and many other soldiers who worked and fought with Zhu Wenqiao. They were all happy to hear that I wanted to learn about Zhu Wenqiao, saying, "Great! Our hero is going to fly to great China!"

Yang Faxian, the talkative young man, spoke up. He asked me, "Do you know about the 'Great Victory at Beicun'? I and Zhu Wenqiao are from the same village, Beicun!" He told me that Zhu Wenqiao, from a young age, herded cows for the landlord and worked as a hired hand, living in a house made of bamboo poles. "Bamboo house," you hear this term for the first time, right! The life of hired farmers in South Vietnam is very hard, with no job security. If the landlord doesn't want them after a few days, they have to kick down the house and find another job. Under such cruel oppression, Zhu Wenqiao developed a silent personality. In the unit, he didn't like to chat, but whenever he heard that other units had won battles, he would worry that his own unit hadn't fought yet!

Cai Long is a small outpost west of Highway 13, only about five or six kilometers from where we are talking now. Before that battle, Zhu Wenqiao and Pan Jincheng were studying together in a reconnaissance training class. One night, while discussing how to carry explosives during an assault, Zhu Wenqiao said, "In critical moments, a revolutionary soldier should use his own body as the last package of explosives." When Pan Jincheng recalled this, he was very emotional. He said, "Zhu Wenqiao was truly a man of his word! In the Cai Long battle, he used this 'last package of explosives' to set an example of a great warrior!"

"Yes! He was indeed a great warrior!" Battalion Commander Wu Zetong rolled a cigarette and said to me, "I commanded the Cai Long battle, and it was I who carried Zhu Wenqiao's body down to bury him." Saying this, he took out a piece of written material titled, "The 'Last Package of Explosives' - The Deeds of Hero Zhu Wenqiao." The battalion commander looked at the material and said thoughtfully, "Before the battle, on the march, I asked Ah Qiao, 'How is it? Are you confident?' He replied, 'Comrade Commander, please rest assured, I will definitely complete the mission!' It was dark then, and I couldn't see his face, but hearing his thunderous voice, I was reassured. At the most critical moment of the battle, when the enemy's pillbox fire was the fiercest, the communication officer reported that Ah Qiao had been seriously injured in the leg. I was very worried, and suddenly the enemy's pillbox fire stopped. Under the light of the flare, I saw Ah Qiao dragging his injured leg, pouncing on the burning gun port..."

The battalion commander's voice choked up. His feelings of mourning, respect, and pride made me suddenly remember a performance not long after I entered Vietnam. When the hero in the dance drama "Zhu Wenqiao" pounced on the gun port, the famous female hero Nguyen Thi Dinh, deputy commander of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, sitting next to me, led the applause. She said to me with respect and pride, "Look, this is our revolutionary struggle, the heroic soldiers of the Vietnamese people!" Her words had barely fallen when the stage had already started a loud recitation:

	We are shedding blood here today to irrigate a beautiful tomorrow...
	Comrade, the "last package of explosives" of Comrade Zhu Wenqiao, did it only destroy an enemy fire point? No! Absolutely not! It ignited the anger in the hearts of the Vietnamese people, and it resonated in the hearts of millions of heroic soldiers! The material given to me by the battalion commander reads: "...Now, Comrade Zhu Wenqiao can no longer fight with us, but his heroic image will forever live in our hearts and be recorded in the annals of the South Vietnamese people's struggle against the Americans. Now, Comrade Zhu Wenqiao has sacrificed himself, but on the road he stained with his blood, thousands and thousands of Zhu Wenqiaos are growing up."

Yes! In this heroic unit, I saw many warriors in the style of Zhu Wenqiao. It can also be said that the entire unit is armed with the spirit of Zhu Wenqiao's revolutionary heroism. "Learn from Zhu Wenqiao," "Fight like Zhu Wenqiao," has become the voluntary oath of every soldier. Look, in the more than two years since Zhu Wenqiao's sacrifice, this unit has collectively won six merit medals, and more than a hundred comrades have been awarded the title of "Beicun Soldier" or "Anti-American Hero."

Dear comrade! Let me introduce a few warriors in the style of Zhu Wenqiao to you. Now, sitting with me under the dim oil lamp are the platoon leader Fan Wenmian, who has destroyed six American M-113 armored vehicles, the old soldier Chen Wenmeng, who shot down a helicopter with a recoilless rifle, and the new soldier Hu Wending, who became an "Anti-American Hero" in his first battle after just two months of enlistment. These young soldiers are very brave and very humble. They always say that their personal achievements are gained under the party's education and the inspiration of Zhu Wenqiao's spirit.

Chen Wenmeng is a recoilless rifle gunner. The recoilless rifle is a direct-fire weapon. However, Chen Wenmeng used a direct-fire rifle to shoot down a helicopter, creating a miracle. He said to me, "The key to battle is the spirit of the people, not the weapons in their hands. With the revolutionary spirit of Zhu Wenqiao, there is no enemy that cannot be defeated!" Later, the battalion commander told me that after Chen Wenmeng shot down the helicopter, his arm was injured, and his blood stained his gun. But he seemed not to know he was injured, only looking at the helicopter split in two and the seven or eight dead enemies, laughing happily.

Zhu Wenqiao's revolutionary spirit gave the soldiers great power in battle. Fan Wenmian said: After I destroyed two American tanks, my ears were deafened by the shelling. Immediately, the third tank came over, and the machine gun on the tank fired fiercely. At this moment, the image of Zhu Wenqiao flashed in my mind, and I immediately braved the enemy's fire, throwing a grenade over, and the third tank also caught fire...

"The Anti-American Hero" Hu Wending is a new soldier. In his first battle, he destroyed a tank and killed seven or eight American bandits. But he didn't want to talk much about his battle situation, only repeating: I came to the unit where Zhu Wenqiao used to be on my first day, and I knew that Zhu Wenqiao did not forget the bitterness of his class, did not forget the hatred of his nation, did not forget the divided homeland, and even more did not forget the savage crimes of the American invaders. In future battles, I will definitely be as brave and tenacious as Zhu Wenqiao, fearless of sacrifice, and use my body as the "last package of explosives."

Dear comrade! Listen, these are not the oaths from the hearts of South Vietnamese soldiers! Who says Zhu Wenqiao has fallen? Hatred is burning, anger is surging, these thousands and thousands of living comrades are growing up rapidly, are they not all like Zhu Wenqiao! In the face of such soldiers, what "elite" troops, what "air superiority," are all to be completely annihilated!

Zhu Wenqiao sacrificed himself bravely, but the people of South Vietnam and North Vietnam have deeply engraved this hero in their hearts. "Zhu Wenqiao Combat Group," "Zhu Wenqiao Guerrilla Squad," "Zhu Wenqiao Training Class," are spread throughout the fighting South and North...

When I was traveling back and forth on the Saigon River, I saw the green river water rushing eastward. On both sides of the riverbank, trees towered, shading half of the river. The wooden bridge built by the engineers under the water had a special battlefield color. The river water flows endlessly, people walk on the river, the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation is advancing victoriously despite its difficulties and twists and turns. The party's education is nurturing a new generation, and Zhu Wenqiao's revolutionary spirit, like the surging eastward Saigon River, is nurturing and inspiring a new generation, as a poem writes:

	With a fiery chest, block the enemy's
	gun port,
	Zhu Wenqiao's revolutionary spirit is
	everlasting!
	The heroic sons and daughters of South Vietnam are
	thousands and thousands,
	The Saigon River flows on forever!

    一个伟大的革命战士
    ——南越寄语
    马真划
    亲爱的战友！在你读过的南越战斗故事中，你一定还记得那位用身体堵枪眼的英雄储文措吧！现在，我正在南越土龙木省西贡河附近的密林里，访问储文措生前所在的英雄部队。“一个人倒下去，千万人站起来”。储文措的革命英雄主义精神对部队的巨大鼓舞，促使我以激动的心情把在这里见到和听到的一切，迫不及待地写给你！
    储文措是一九六三年十月十八日攻打丐长据点时英勇献身的。在这支部队里，人们都传颂着储文措的英雄事迹。他的名字象是长上了翅膀，飞遍了南越的高山平原，飞进了全体战士的心里。在这里，我见到许多储文措生前的战友，其中有丐长战斗的指挥员、现任营长武则同志，有储文措的同乡、在一起战斗一年多的副排长杨发贤同志，有丐长战斗前和储文措同志一起学习战斗侦察的班长潘进成同志，还有许多和储文措一起工作、一起战斗的战士。他们听说我要了解储文措，都高兴地说：“好啊！我们的英雄要飞到伟大的中国去啦！”其实，储文措的事迹早已传到了中国。
    杨发贤这个爱说话的小伙子开腔了。他先问我：“你知道‘北村大捷’吗？我和储文措是同乡，都是北村人呀！”他告诉我，储文措从小给地主放牛，当雇工，住的是用竹杆搭起来的踢房。“踢房”，你第一次听到这个名词吧！南越的雇农生活很苦，职业毫无保障，干了几天地主不要了，就只好把房子踢倒，另找活干。储文措在这种残酷压迫下，形成了一种闷声不响的性格。在部队里，他不喜欢谈笑，但一听到别的部队打胜仗，他就为自己部队打不上仗而着急！
    丐长是十三号公路西面的一个小据点，离我们现在谈话的地方只有五六公里。那次战斗之前，储文措和潘进成一起在侦察训练班学习。有一天晚上，大家在讨论攻坚中如何携带炸药时，储文措说：“在紧要的时候，革命战士应该把自己的身体，当做最后一包炸药。”潘进成回忆起这件事的时候，感情非常激动。他说：“储文措真是个说到做到的人！在丐长战斗中，他用这‘最后一包炸药’，树立了一个伟大战士的形象！”
    “是的！他确实是一个伟大的战士！”营长武则同志卷了枝纸烟，对我说：“丐长战斗是我指挥的，储文措的遗体也是我抱下来安葬的。”说着，他找出一份文字材料，题目是：《“最后一包炸药”——英雄储文措的事迹》。营长望着这份材料，沉思地说：“战前行军路上，我问过阿措：‘怎么样，有把握吗？’他回答说：‘首长，请放心，我一定完成任务！’那时天黑，看不清脸孔，但听到他那闷雷似的声音，我就放心了。在战斗最紧急、敌人暗堡的火力最猛烈的时候，通讯员报告说阿措腿上负了重伤。我很着急，忽然，敌人暗堡的火力中断了。借着照明弹的光亮，我看到阿措拖着条负伤的腿，扑在冒火的枪眼上……在最紧急的时候，他使用了‘最后一包炸药’。”……
    营长的声音哽住了。他这种充满了悼念、崇敬和自豪的感情，使我忽然想起了入越不久的一次晚会。当舞剧《储文措》里的英雄扑向枪眼的时候，坐在我旁边的南越解放军副司令员、著名的女英雄阮氏定同志带头鼓起掌来。她怀着崇敬和自豪的情感对我说：“你看，这就是我们的革命斗争，越南人民的英雄战士！”她的话音刚落，舞台上已经开始了高声的朗诵：
    我们今天在这儿流血，是为了灌溉美好的明天……
    战友同志啊！储文措同志的“最后一包炸药”，仅仅炸毁敌人一个火力点吗？不！绝不！它燃起了越南人民心中的怒火，它引起了千百万英雄战士心底的共鸣！营长给我的这份材料上写着：“……现在，储文措同志再也不能和我们一起战斗了，但他那英雄的形象，却永远活在我们心中，记载在南越人民反美斗争的史册上。如今，储文措同志牺牲了，但是，在他用鲜血染红的道路上，千千万万储文措正茁壮地成长起来。”
    是的！我在这支英雄部队里，看到许多储文措式的战士。也可以这样说，整个部队就是用储文措那种革命英雄主义精神武装起来的。“学习储文措”，
  “象储文措那样战斗”，成了每个战士自觉的誓言。你看，在储文措牺牲后的两年多时间里，这支部队就集体获得了六枚战功勋章，上百个同志被评为“北村战士”或“歼美勇士”。
    亲爱的战友！让我向你介绍几位储文措式的战士吧。现在，在昏暗的小油灯下和我坐在一起的，有先后打毁六辆美国M—113装甲车的班长范文绵，有用无后座力炮打下一架直升飞机的老战士陈文猛，也有入伍刚两个月、第一次作战就成为“歼美勇士”的新战士胡文东。这些年青的战士，非常勇敢，又非常谦虚。他们总是说，个人取得的成绩，是在党的教育和储文措精神的鼓舞下获得的。
    陈文猛是无后座力炮的炮手。无后座力炮是平射的。可是陈文猛却用平射炮打下了直升飞机，创造了奇迹。他对我说：“战斗，重要的是人的精神，而不是手里的武器。有了储文措那样的革命精神，就没有打不垮的敌人！”后来营长告诉我，陈文猛打下直升飞机以后，膀子上负了伤，鲜血染红了他的炮身。可是，他好象不知道自己负了伤，只顾望着被炸成两截的直升飞机和死掉的七八个敌人，乐得哈哈直笑。
    储文措的革命精神，在战斗中给了战士以巨大的力量。范文绵说：我打坏两辆美国战车以后，耳朵给炮弹震聋了。紧接着，第三辆战车又开了过来，战车上的机枪猛烈地射击。这时，我脑子里闪过了储文措的形象，立刻冒着敌人的火力，把手雷投过去，第三辆战车又烧了起来……。
    “歼美勇士”胡文东是个新战士，刚打第一仗，就打毁了一辆战车，消灭了七八个美国强盗。但他不愿多谈自己战斗的情况，只反复地说：我第一天来到储文措生前所在的部队，就知道储文措不忘阶级的苦，不忘民族的仇，不忘被分割的祖国，更不忘美国侵略者的野蛮罪行。在今后的战斗中，我一定要象储文措那样英勇顽强，不怕牺牲，把身体当做“最后一包炸药”。
    亲爱的战友啊！你听听，这不都是南越战士发自内心的誓言么！谁说储文措已经倒了下去？仇在燃烧，恨在奔腾，这千千万万活着的同志，不正在迅速成长起来，不个个都象储文措么！在这样的战士面前，什么“王牌”呀，什么“海空优势”呀，都是要被彻底消灭的！
    储文措英勇牺牲了，越南南方和北方的人民，却把这位英雄深深地刻在心里。“储文措战斗小组”，
  “储文措游击小队”，“储文措训练班”，遍布整个战斗的南方和北方。……在我往返于西贡河上的时候，我曾看到碧绿的河水，急促地向东奔去。河堤两边，树木参天，斜盖着半边河面。那工兵架造的水下木桥，有着一种特殊的战地色彩。河水不断流，人从河上走，越南人民的抗美救国斗争就是这样艰难曲折但又是胜利地前进着。党的教育，哺育着新的一代，储文措的革命精神，就象这滔滔东去的西贡河水，哺育着、启示着新的一代，正如一首诗所写的：
    用火热的胸膛堵敌人
      的枪口，
    储文措的革命精神永
      垂不朽！
    南越的英雄儿女千千
      万啊，
    西贡河水永远不尽
      流！
