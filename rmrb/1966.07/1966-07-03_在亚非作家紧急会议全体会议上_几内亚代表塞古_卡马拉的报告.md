	In the general meeting of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, the representative of Guinea, Sekou Camara, delivered a report today. He enthusiastically praised the victories of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against the U.S. imperialist war of aggression. He said, the Vietnamese people have concretely proven that the people who fight for independence are invincible. They have demonstrated on their own land that it is people, not things, that decide the outcome of a war, as Chairman Mao Zedong has said.

	He expressed his firm support for the struggle of the Vietnamese people. He said, regardless of the consequences, we will always stand with the Vietnamese people.

	He condemned the splitist meeting held in Cairo. He said, we have given a resolute rebuff to this challenge. The entire revolutionary Africa's attendance at the Beijing meeting is sufficient proof of our opposition to this disruptive action.

	He said, the National Zoliba Dance Troupe of Guinea that recently arrived in Beijing is a product of the cultural revolution in Guinea. The dance troupe will express the feelings of the Guinean people towards the great Chinese people and their leader, Chairman Mao Zedong.

	In discussing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, he said, our situation enables us to understand well the great cultural revolution currently underway in China for the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is nothing else; it is the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism. Without Mao Zedong Thought, there is no revolutionary practice.

    在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上
    几内亚代表塞古·卡马拉的报告
    新华社二日讯　几内亚代表塞古·卡马拉今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上作报告，热烈赞扬越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略战争的胜利。他说，越南人民具体证明了为争取独立而进行斗争的人民是不可战胜的。他们在自己的土地上证实了毛泽东的话，决定战争胜负的是人，而不是物。
    他表示坚决支持越南人民的斗争。他说，不论后果如何，我们总是永远和越南人民在一起的。
    他谴责开罗的分裂会议。他说，我们对这种挑战进行了迎头痛击，整个革命非洲出席北京的会议足以证明我们对这个破坏性行动的反对。
    他说，最近到达北京的几内亚国立佐利巴舞蹈团就是几内亚进行文化方面革命的产物。舞蹈团将表现出几内亚人民对伟大的中国人民及其领袖——毛泽东主席的感情。
    在谈到中国的文化大革命时，他说，我们的处境使我们很了解为了毛泽东思想的胜利，目前正在中国开展的伟大的文化革命。毛泽东思想不是别的，它是马克思列宁主义的革命理论，没有毛泽东思想就没有革命的实践。
