The petroleum industry workers of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have continued to emphasize politics this year, placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. They have striven to achieve the revolutionization of thoughts and enterprises, thereby promoting the comprehensive leap forward in production and construction. This year, the original oil and major petroleum products such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil have all exceeded the state plan, and there has been a significant increase compared to the same period last year. The total recovery rate of oil products and other major technical and economic indicators have also surpassed the fourth quarter of last year, reaching a historic high.

The quality of petroleum products has improved. Since the beginning of the year, all car engine oils produced by various factories have been added with an additive that can extend the usage time, making one ton of engine oil equivalent to two tons of the original, saving the country a large amount of lubricating oil. Other oil products such as car gasoline and diesel have also improved significantly in quality due to improved processes or the adoption of new technologies and processes.

Various refineries across the country have also successfully developed a batch of high-grade new products for various sectors of the national economy this year.

In oil field exploration, development, and basic construction, a good situation has emerged. New oil structures have been discovered, and oil flows with industrial exploitation value have been identified. A batch of new oil wells and new refining equipment have been put into production one after another, with excellent engineering quality, all achieving successful production in one go.

Over the past few years, the petroleum industry workers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, achieving great results in the three great revolutionary movements. They not only shed the label of backwardness in the petroleum industry, achieving self-sufficiency in petroleum products, but also forged themselves into a force armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with strong thoughts, style, and technology. Especially the emergence of advanced enterprises like the Daqing Oilfield, which have embarked on the path of running enterprises with Mao Zedong Thought, setting an example for China's socialist industrial construction.

This year, petroleum industry workers across the country have raised the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher to seize greater victories. They have emphasized politics, taking class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key, further promoting the revolutionization of leadership, workers' thoughts, and enterprises. So far, all petroleum enterprises and geological exploration teams across the country have launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. A large number of active members of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works have emerged from workshops and construction sites. The political atmosphere in various units is becoming stronger, and the spiritual outlook of the workers is improving. The idea of not seeking fame or personal gain, not fearing hardship or death, and dedicating oneself wholeheartedly to the revolution has taken root. Especially in the current great proletarian cultural revolution, petroleum industry workers across the country are even more eager to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, actively participating in the denunciation, exposure, and criticism of the anti-party and anti-socialist black gangs, sweeping away all ghosts and snakes, thereby greatly enhancing class consciousness and surging revolutionary enthusiasm. They say: "The oil field is the battlefield of class struggle, and the drill bit is a weapon to strike down the anti-party and anti-socialist black gangs. Drill more wells, produce more oil, and strike down these ghosts and snakes forever!" The 1803 drilling team of the Daqing Oilfield has, in the cultural revolution, emphasized politics, repeatedly studied "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," thoroughly criticized the bourgeois "authority," and on June 18, once again created the world record of 72.94 meters of long core rock.

Many unit leaders, through the mass mobilization of great debate and great outspokenness since the beginning of the year, as well as the systematic summary of experiences and lessons from the Great Leap Forward, have further realized that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is fundamental to promoting the revolutionization of leadership and achieving the revolutionization of enterprises. Units such as the Daqing Oilfield and the Shengli Oilfield have organized comprehensive work teams (which are also political work teams) led by the main leaders of the enterprises, going deep into the grassroots to stay and work. They labor, study Chairman Mao's works, and participate in the proletarian cultural revolution with the workers, helping to solve problems in grassroots work, and are deeply welcomed by the workers. After a period of staying and working, various units have discovered some important problems in grassroots work and enterprise management, accumulated some work experience, and laid a better foundation for further achieving the revolutionization of enterprises.

    把活学活用毛主席著作摆在一切工作首位  努力实现职工思想革命化和企业革命化
    石油工业生产建设继续全面跃进
    上半年主要石油产品全部超额完成计划，主要技术经济指标创历史最高水平
    据新华社八日讯　用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国石油工业职工今年以来继续大力突出政治，把活学活用毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位，努力实现思想革命化和企业革命化，从而推进了生产建设的全面跃进。今年上半年，他们生产的原油以及汽油、煤油、柴油、润滑油等主要石油产品，全都超额完成了国家计划，并且比去年同期有了很大增长。油品的总收率和其他主要技术经济指标，也都超过了去年第四季度，创造了历史最高水平。
    石油产品的质量更好了。年初以来，各厂生产的车用机油，全部加了一种能够延长使用时间的添加剂，使一吨机油能顶原来的两吨用，为国家节省了大量的润滑油。其他油品象车用汽油、柴油等，也由于改进了工艺，或采用了新工艺、新技术，质量比过去有显著提高。
    各地炼油厂今年还为国民经济各部门，试制成功了一批高级的新产品。
    在油田勘探、开发和基本建设方面，也出现一派大好形势。又找到了新的石油构造，探明了有工业开采价值的油流。又有一批新油井和新的炼油装置先后投入了生产，工程质量优良，全部作到了一次投产成功。
    石油工业职工在过去几年中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，在三大革命运动中取得了巨大的成果。他们不但甩掉了石油工业的落后帽子，使我国石油产品作到自给，并且也把自己锻炼成了一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的思想、作风、技术都过得硬的队伍，特别是出现了象大庆油田这样高度革命化的先进企业，走上了用毛泽东思想办企业的道路，为我国社会主义工业建设创造了范例。
    今年以来，各地石油工业职工为了夺取更大的胜利，更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，狠抓突出政治，以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，进一步促进了领导革命化、职工思想革命化和企业革命化。到目前为止，全国所有的石油企业和地质勘探队，都掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。大批活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子，从车间、从工地不断涌现了出来。各单位的政治空气越来越浓，职工的精神面貌越来越好，不为名、不为利、不怕苦、不怕死，一心一意为革命的思想深入人心。
    特别是在当前这场气势磅礴的无产阶级文化大革命中，各地石油企业职工更是如饥如渴地活学活用毛主席著作，积极参加声讨、揭发、批判反党反社会主义黑帮，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，因而大大提高了阶级觉悟，革命怒潮汹涌澎湃。他们说：“井场就是阶级斗争的战场，钻头也是打击反党反社会主义黑帮的武器，多打井，多出油，打得这些牛鬼蛇神永世不得翻身！”大庆油田一八○三钻井队，在文化大革命中大力突出政治，反复学习《矛盾论》和《实践论》，大破资产阶级“权威”，在六月十八日再一次创造了长筒岩心七十二点九四米的世界最高纪录。
    许多单位的领导干部，通过年初以来发动群众大鸣大放，开展政治和业务关系的大辩论，以及系统地总结大跃进以来的经验教训，进一步认识了活学活用毛主席著作，是促进领导革命化，实现企业革命化的根本。大庆油田、胜利油田等单位，都组织了由企业主要领导干部率领的大批综合工作队（也是政治工作队），深入基层蹲点。他们同工人一起劳动，一起学习毛主席著作，一起参加无产阶级文化大革命，帮助和解决基层工作中的问题，因而深受工人群众的欢迎。经过前一个时期的蹲点，各单位都发现了一些基层工作和企业管理中的重要问题，积累了一些工作经验，为进一步实现企业革命化奠定了更好的基础。
