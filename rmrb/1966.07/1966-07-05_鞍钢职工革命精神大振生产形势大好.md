Anshan Steel workers are more consciously arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Their class consciousness has reached an unprecedented height, and their revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity have been given full play. In the first five months of this year, the steel they produced in excess of the same period last year is enough to manufacture over 50,000 heavy-duty trucks. The funds they have accumulated for the state are sufficient to build over 40 large blast furnaces.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, the steel industry base of our country, has seen a very good production situation this year. The increase in output, the variety and quality of products, and the reduction in costs are all unprecedented in the history of Anshan Steel.

The fact that Anshan Steel has made a comprehensive leap forward in production this year vividly shows that Mao Zedong Thought is an inexhaustible source of power. The radiance of Mao Zedong Thought shines on the blast furnaces, and people fear no difficulties and dare to scale new heights in iron smelting technology. Iron smelting workers have used Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" to tame the blast furnaces, making the production situation of the furnaces better and better. The utilization coefficient and coke consumption, which have already reached international advanced levels last year, have reached new heights this year.

The radiance of Mao Zedong Thought shines on the open-hearth furnaces, making people's hearts redder and the furnace fires brighter. Since this year, steel smelting workers have conducted extensive scientific experiments on the open-hearth furnaces. The number of low-alloy steel varieties they have successfully smelted this year is more than the entire year of last year, and the production of low-alloy steel has increased several times compared to last year.

The radiance of Mao Zedong Thought shines on the rolling mills, and the revolutionary spirit of the workers is more vigorous, producing more new steel varieties. They have already successfully developed more new products this year than the entire year of last year. The quality of the original thousands of steel specifications has reached a new height, and the production of economical and wear-resistant steel has greatly increased.

The radiance of Mao Zedong Thought shines on the enterprise management departments, and a large number of technical and management personnel are full of vigor. They have all walked out of their offices and gone to the production front lines, devoting themselves to production and conducting scientific experiments with the workers to seriously reform their non-proletarian thoughts.

At the beginning of this year, the Anshan Steel Party Committee mobilized the broad masses of workers to use Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly, comprehensively, and systematically summarize the experience of learning from the People's Liberation Army and learning from Daqing. They proposed the goal for 1966 to "raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, emphasize politics, take class struggle as the key link, learn extensively from the People's Liberation Army and Daqing, thoroughly implement the revolutionization of enterprises, and catch up with and surpass the most advanced levels domestically and internationally." Anshan Steel workers, centering on this goal, have made strenuous efforts to win a brilliant battle in the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan and support the production and construction of various sectors of our national economy.

In the extensive debate on the relationship between politics and business, the broad masses of Anshan Steel workers have further realized that only by relying on Mao Zedong Thought can they shoulder the heavy responsibilities of the revolution. They confidently say, "No matter how difficult it is, it will not be difficult if we master Mao Zedong Thought." Therefore, they have launched a new wave of eager learning and applying Chairman Mao's works from the beginning of this year. Especially after the great proletarian cultural revolution has been launched, the enthusiasm of the workers to learn and apply Chairman Mao's works has soared even higher. They use Mao Zedong Thought to solve their own ideological problems, to explore the laws of production, and to solve key production problems.

    更自觉地用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑
    鞍钢职工革命精神大振生产形势大好
    今年头五个多月内比去年同期超产的钢材，可供制造五万多辆解放牌载重汽车，为国家积累的资金，足够建设四十多座大型高炉
    据新华社鞍山电　我国钢铁工业基地鞍钢的广大职工，在汹涌澎湃的文化大革命中更自觉地用毛泽东思想武装自己，阶级觉悟空前提高，革命积极性和创造性得到了更充分的发挥。他们在今年头五个多月内比去年同期超产的钢材，可供制造五万多辆解放牌载重汽车，他们为国家积累的资金，足够建设四十多座大型高炉。
    今年鞍钢的生产形势很好，产量上升幅度之大，品种质量之好，成本下降之多，在鞍钢历史上都是极少见的。
    鞍钢今年生产全面跃进的事实生动地表明，毛泽东思想是无穷威力的源泉。毛泽东思想的光芒照射在炼铁高炉上，人们就不畏艰难，勇于攀登世界炼铁技术新高峰。炼铁职工运用毛主席的《矛盾论》《实践论》驯服了高炉，使高炉生产情况越来越好，利用系数、焦炭消耗等指标在去年已经达到国际先进水平的基础上，今年以来又登上了新的高峰。
    毛泽东思想的光芒照射在炼钢平炉上，人心更红，炉火更旺。今年以来，炼钢职工在平炉上大搞科学试验，冶炼成功的低合金钢种比去年全年还多，低合金钢的产量比去年全年还增加了几倍。
    毛泽东思想的光芒照射在轧钢机上，工人群众的革命精神更加奋发，造出了更多的新钢材品种。他们今年已经试制成功的新产品比去年全年还多出一倍。原有的数千种规格的钢材，质量又达到了一个新高度，经济、耐磨的钢材大大增加了。
    毛泽东思想的光芒照射到企业管理部门，大批技术人员、管理人员意气风发。他们纷纷走出办公室，深入生产第一线，全心全意为生产服务，同工人一起挥汗搞科学试验，认真改造自己的非无产阶级思想。
    今年初，鞍钢党委发动广大职工群众，运用毛泽东思想，认真、全面、系统地总结了学习解放军、学习大庆的经验，并且提出了一九六六年要“更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，以阶级斗争为纲，大学解放军、大学大庆、彻底实现企业革命化，赶超国内外最先进水平”的奋斗目标。鞍钢职工围绕这个目标，奋发努力，决心在第三个五年计划的头一年打一个漂亮仗，支援我国国民经济各部门的生产建设。
    鞍钢广大职工在深入开展的关于政治与业务关系的大辩论中，进一步认识到只有依靠毛泽东思想，才能担当起革命的重担子。他们信心十足地说：“千难万难，掌握了毛泽东思想就不难。”因此，他们在今年一开始就掀起了如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作的新热潮。特别是在无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈展开以后，职工们活学活用毛主席著作的热情更加高涨。他们运用毛泽东思想去解决自己的思想问题，去探讨生产规律，解决生产上的关键问题。
