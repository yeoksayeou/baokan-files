The initiative always belongs to the fighting people of South Vietnam

The armed forces of the South Vietnamese liberation movement launched a surprise attack on the Batu Me military airfield in the province of Kien Phong on July 7, destroying and damaging 50 enemy aircraft in just 12 minutes and killing or wounding more than 150 American invaders. The news of this victory has invigorated the people. We heartily congratulate the heroic armed forces of the South Vietnamese liberation movement.

Recently, American imperialism has been at a loss in the Vietnam War, continuing to send large numbers of troops to South Vietnam while more frenziedly intensifying its bombing of North Vietnam, all in a desperate attempt to force a negotiated settlement through bombing. American military and political leaders and propaganda machines have been spreading a so-called "optimistic" atmosphere about the Vietnam situation, boasting that the initiative has shifted to the United States, claiming that the United States has finally begun to win the war militarily. The resounding victory achieved by the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces in their surprise attack on the Batu Me airfield is a mocking rebuke to the American aggressors' boasting and another powerful response to the American imperialists' scheme of "bombing to force negotiations."

The South Vietnamese military and people have attacked American airfields before. In the past, after suffering defeats, American aggressors would always use the excuse of insufficient defense forces to cover up their failures. Now, the American aggressors have increased their forces to nearly 300,000, but their passive and helpless situation remains unchanged, with no improvement whatsoever. The American aggressors are deluded, hoping to gain the initiative in the war. However, as Chairman Mao pointed out, the initiative in war is the freedom of the army. If an army loses the initiative and is forced into a passive position, it is no longer free and faces the danger of being annihilated or defeated. As soon as the American aggressor army set foot on South Vietnamese soil, it was engulfed in the vast ocean of the South Vietnamese people's war, losing its freedom. Meanwhile, the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces, on their own land and with the support of the South Vietnamese people, can flexibly disperse, concentrate, attack, and maneuver, always maintaining the initiative in the war. No matter how many American aggressor troops are increased, or what new weapons or tactics they use, they will not be able to change their passive and helpless situation. The initiative will always be in the hands of the South Vietnamese people. The great victory at Batu Me has once again proven this.

### 主动权永远属于战斗的南越人民

　　主动权永远属于战斗的南越人民
    越南南方解放武装力量七月七日奇袭芹苴省巴图美伪军用机场，在十二分钟之内，一举毁伤敌机五十架，打死打伤美国侵略军一百五十多名。捷报传来，人心振奋。我们谨向英勇的越南南方解放武装力量表示热烈的祝贺。
    最近，美帝国主义在侵越战争中走投无路，一面继续大量增兵越南南方，一面更疯狂地加强对越南北方的轰炸，大搞“以炸迫和”的阴谋。美国的军政首脑和宣传机器大事散布对越南战局的所谓“乐观”空气，叫嚷什么“主动权已转到”美国手中了，什么美国“在军事上终于开始打赢这场战争”了。越南南方解放武装力量在对巴图机场的奇袭中所取得的辉煌胜利，是对美国侵略者这种吹牛皮的无情嘲笑，也是对美帝国主义“以炸迫和”阴谋的又一个有力的回答。
    越南南方军民袭击美军机场，这并不是第一次。过去美国侵略者吃了败仗以后，总是以守卫兵力不足来掩饰自己的败绩。现在，美国侵略者已经把兵力增加到近三十万之众，但是它被动挨打的狼狈处境，却依然如故，没有得到一丝一毫的改善。美国侵略者痴心妄想，力图获得战争的主动权。但是，正如毛主席所指出的，战争的主动权，即是军队的自由权。军队失掉了主动权，被逼处于被动地位，这个军队就不自由，就有被消灭或被打败的危险。美国侵略军队一踏上南越的土地，就陷入了南越人民战争的汪洋大海之中，就丧失了自由权。而越南南方解放武装力量，在自己的土地上，在南越人民的支持下，却能灵活地分散、集中、进攻、转移，始终保持战争的主动权。不管美国侵略军增加到多少，也不管它再搬出什么样的新式武器，运用什么样的新式战术，都不可能改变它被动挨打的局面。主动权永远掌握在南越人民的手中。巴图大捷再一次证明了这一点。
