In response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call to arms, young workers, agricultural cooperatives, students, and reserve soldiers from various parts of North Vietnam have been enthusiastically enlisting and applying to return to the front lines in recent days. They have demonstrated their determination to defeat the American aggressors with concrete actions, resolutely responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's order to mobilize part of the reserve forces.

In the capital, Hanoi, more than 200,000 young people and all reserve soldiers have unanimously pledged to Chairman Ho: "We are always ready. As soon as the motherland calls, we will immediately rush to the front lines and bravely fight the enemy." In recent days, under the slogan "Firmly take up arms and thoroughly bury the American aggressors," they have intensified military training and battle preparations while eagerly enlisting. All reserve soldiers at the Son Long Cigarette Factory wrote letters of determination to return to the front lines the day after Chairman Ho issued his call to arms, promising to report as soon as they are called. Their work and production tasks can immediately be taken over by women participating in the "Three Assumptions" movement. Meanwhile, more than a thousand young people and women in the factory have volunteered to enlist or serve in the battle. The broad masses of young workers at the Peace Automobile Repair Factory, which has a glorious tradition of resisting the French, have also responded to Chairman Ho's call with enthusiastic enlistment and hard work in production.

In the provinces and cities of Hai Phong, Quang Binh, Ninh Binh, Nghe An, Quang Ninh, and Cao Bang, young men and women have been inspired by Chairman Ho's call to arms, their fighting spirit soaring. They have been eager to rush to the front lines and directly participate in the battle against the enemy. According to incomplete statistics from more than 30 labor youth league branches in Hai Phong City, more than 3,000 league members and young people have enlisted in the past few days. Tens of thousands of young people in Cao Bang Province have decided to carry on the revolutionary tradition, resolutely enlisting. In Ninh Binh Province, thousands of demobilized soldiers, reserve soldiers, and militia members have submitted applications to relevant departments in recent days, expressing their desire to enlist and return to the front lines to fight. Young people in Quang Ninh Province have also launched a wave of enlistment, eagerly requesting to go to the front lines. Nguyen Van Bi, deputy platoon leader of the workers' militia in the Ha Tinh mining area, and female cadre Le Thi Hien recently received notices to study abroad and attend university, respectively. However, after hearing Chairman Ho's call to arms, they both resolutely enlisted.

In the entire North Vietnam, many touching stories of mothers sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, and couples both enlisting have emerged in recent days. Everywhere, one can hear the bold words of determination to defeat the American aggressors. Mrs. Vu Thi Giao from Dong Da District in Hanoi has six sons, five of whom are currently fighting on the front lines. After studying Chairman Ho's "Letter to the Nation," she personally went to the enlistment office to request that her sixth son be allowed to enlist and fight the enemy. This heroic mother said, "Sending sons to the army is the pride of the whole family and the pride of being a mother. Chairman Ho teaches us that only with national independence and freedom will we have everything. Only by thoroughly defeating and driving out the American aggressors can our country and every family have true reunification." Worker Tran Duy Khoi from the Hanoi An Phu Power Plant has already sent four sons to the front lines for the great cause of resisting America and saving the nation. Now he is requesting that his fifth son be sent to the army. He said excitedly, "Against the American aggressors, there is only one way: to fight decisively and fight fiercely. Even if it takes several generations, we are determined to defeat them."

Vietnamese People's Army soldiers are determined to train themselves to be excellent fighters, ready to strike the American aggressors at any time. (Vietnam News Agency, Xinhua News Agency)

    越南青年踊跃参军响应胡主席动员令
    河内二十多万青年发出战斗誓言：只要祖国一声令下，立即奔赴前线杀敌
    新华社河内二十六日电　本社记者报道：在胡志明主席的伟大战斗号召下，越南北方各地的广大青年职工、农业社社员、学生和预备役军人连日来纷纷报名参军和申请重返部队，以决心战胜美国侵略强盗的实际行动，坚决响应胡志明主席关于动员一部分后备兵员的命令。
    在首都河内市，二十多万青年和所有预备役军人，一致向胡主席提出保证：时刻作好准备，只要祖国一声令下，便立即奔赴前线，英勇杀敌。连日来，他们在“坚决拿起武器，彻底埋葬美国侵略强盗”的口号下，一方面加紧军事训练和战斗准备，一方面踊跃报名参军。升龙卷烟厂的全体预备役军人，在胡主席发出战斗号召的第二天，都写了申请重返前线的决心书，保证随召随到，而他们的工作和生产任务立即可以由参加“三承担”运动的妇女承担起来。同时，全厂一千多名青年和妇女，也自愿报名参军或为战斗服务。具有抗法斗争光荣传统的和平汽车修理厂，广大青年职工也以热烈报名参军和努力生产的实际行动来响应胡主席的号召。
    海防、广平、河静、义安、广宁、高平等省市的广大青年男女在胡主席的战斗号召鼓舞下，也斗志昂扬，纷纷要求立即奔赴前线，直接参加杀敌战斗。仅据海防市三十多个劳动青年团支部的不完全统计，这几天来就有三千多名团员和青年报名参军。高平省数以万计的青年，决心发扬革命光荣传统，毅然报名参军。在河静省，这几天来也有成千上万的复员军人、预备役军人和民兵自卫队员，怀着保卫祖国的战斗激情，向有关部门递交了申请书，要求参军和重返前线参加战斗。广宁省青年也掀起从军热潮，并纷纷要求奔赴前线。河临矿区工人自卫队副排长阮文笔和女干部黎氏宪，最近都分别接到出国留学和升大学的通知书，但在听到胡主席的战斗号召以后，他们都毅然决然地报名参军。
    在整个越南北方，这几天来出现了许多母亲送儿子、妻子送丈夫和夫妻双双要求参军的动人事迹。到处都可以听到决心战胜美国侵略强盗的豪言壮语。河内市栋多区吴氏交老大娘，共有六个儿子，目前已有五个儿子在前线参加战斗。她在学习了胡主席的《告全国同胞书》后，又亲自到入伍登记处，要求批准她的第六个儿子参军杀敌。这位英雄母亲说：“送儿子参军是全家的光荣，也是做母亲的光荣。胡主席教导我们，有了民族的独立和自由，才会有一切。只有把美国强盗彻底打垮、赶走了，我们国家、我们每个家庭才能有真正的团聚。”河内安付发电厂工人任德怀，为了抗美救国的伟大事业，已把四个儿子送上前线，现在他又要求把第五个儿子送到部队。他激动地说，“对付美国侵略强盗，只有一个办法，这就是：坚决地打，狠狠地打。即使要同它打几代，我们也决心把它打败。”
