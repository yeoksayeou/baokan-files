	The light shines over the entire world
	( Hui Ethnic Minority Folk Song )

	Chairman Mao's works are excellent, every word and sentence is a treasure.
	The light shines over the entire world, the revolutionary red flag flutters in the wind.
	It is the pillar of the revolution, it is our guiding star;
	The direction is clear, the will is firm, unshaken by storms and waves.
	Chairman Mao's works are excellent, every word and sentence is a treasure.
	We study diligently every day, our stance is firm and our consciousness is high.
	The mind has a compass, seeing far and standing high;
	Seeing far, standing high, no difficulty can frighten us.
	Chairman Mao's works are excellent, every word and sentence is a treasure.
	The true theory of revolution is in our hands, class struggle must be remembered.
	Forever following Chairman Mao, the hearts of all ethnic peoples are united.
	The revolutionary red flag is held high, the construction of the motherland makes great leaps.

    光芒照耀全世界
    （回族民歌）毛主席著作就是好，一字一句都是宝。光芒照耀全世界，革命红旗迎风飘。它是革命的擎天柱，它是我们的指路标；方向明，意志坚，大风大浪不动摇。毛主席著作就是好，一字一句都是宝。咱们天天勤学习，立场坚定觉悟高。思想有了方向盘，看得远来站得高；看得远，站得高，任何困难吓不倒。毛主席著作就是好，一字一句都是宝。革命真理学到手，阶级斗争要记牢。永远跟着毛主席，各族人民心一条。革命红旗高高举，祖国建设大飞跃。
