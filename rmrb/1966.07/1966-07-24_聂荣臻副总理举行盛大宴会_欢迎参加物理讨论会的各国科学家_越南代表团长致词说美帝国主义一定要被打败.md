Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen held a grand banquet tonight to warmly welcome the physicists and scientists from more than 30 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania who are attending the 1966 Summer Physics Discussion Meeting of the Beijing Science Discussion Meeting.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Guo Moruo, and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and President of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology Li Siguang attended the banquet.

The grand banquet was held in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People. When our leaders and scientists from the four continents entered the brightly lit banquet hall together, the orchestra played the welcoming music, and hundreds of Chinese and foreign guests applauded warmly. The entire banquet hall was filled with a friendly and united atmosphere.

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen said in his speech at the banquet that in the development of the national and people's scientific undertakings, the peoples and scientists of the four continents have already forged a great and fighting friendship. The convening of this physics discussion meeting once again demonstrates our determination to strengthen unity and cooperation among the peoples and scientists of the four continents and to develop national and people's science.

He pointed out that by relying on and strengthening the cooperation among the peoples and scientists of the four continents, which is based on equality, mutual benefit, mutual assistance, mutual learning, and common progress, we can break the monopoly and control of imperialism and revive and flourish the scientific undertakings of our own nations and peoples. He said that after the peoples of the four continents have cast off the shackles of colonialism and gained national independence, we will definitely catch up with and surpass the imperialist countries of the West in the development of national science and the ascent to the heights of world science.

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen said that opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States is the basis for the unity of the peoples of the four continents. The unity of the scientists of the four continents is an important component of the anti-imperialist united front of the peoples of the four continents. He said that the Chinese people, following the teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong, have consistently and resolutely opposed imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, and resolutely support the anti-imperialist patriotic struggles of all countries and peoples invaded and bullied by American imperialism.

Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen finally said that the Chinese people and scientists, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, following the teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong on liberating the mind and breaking superstitions, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to innovate, and dare to make a revolution, will definitely walk our own path in developing our own scientific undertakings; at the same time, we have always followed the teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong, earnestly and humbly learning the achievements and advanced experiences of various countries' peoples in science and technology. The convening of this physics discussion meeting provides a good opportunity for our physics community to learn. We will definitely learn well from the scientists of various countries. We are also willing to provide our research results to the scientists of the participating countries for reference and discussion.

The leader of the Vietnamese scientific delegation, Wei Rukun Song, made a toast at the banquet. He said that in the current life-and-death struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialist aggression, as Chairman Liu Shaoqi announced, 700 million Chinese people are the strong backing of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear area of the Vietnamese people. The firm unity and fighting friendship between the two peoples of Vietnam and China are the most reliable guarantee for defeating the American aggressors. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, 31 million Vietnamese people are full of confidence in victory, tightly grasping their guns, determined to rise up and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors. The victory of the Vietnamese people's anti-American war is also the victory of the progressive people of the whole world. The common enemy of the peoples of all countries, American imperialism, will definitely be defeated. He concluded by shouting in Chinese, "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Foreign famous scientists, peace activists, and friends from other fields who are in Beijing were also invited to attend the banquet. Among them were Nishisonji Kazuichi from Japan, Madame Keuning from Laos, Willy from Indonesia, Paron from Thailand, Kair from Sudan, and radio astronomer Christiansen from Australia.

Leaders from various relevant departments in China, such as Liao Chengzhi, Liu Xiao, Han Guang, Chu Tunan, Hao Deqing, and Liu Zizai, as well as the entire delegation of Chinese scientists led by Zhou Peiyuan, attended the banquet tonight to accompany and warmly gather with the scientists from the four continents.

    越南代表团长致词说美帝国主义一定要被打败
    据新华社二十三日讯　国务院副总理聂荣臻今晚举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎出席北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、大洋洲三十多个国家的一百多位物理学家和科学家。
    国务院副总理陈毅，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国科学院院长郭沫若，政协全国委员会副主席、中国科学技术协会主席李四光，出席了今晚的宴会。
    盛大的宴会在人民大会堂宴会厅举行。当我国领导人同来自四大洲的各国科学家一起进入灯火辉煌的宴会大厅时，乐队奏迎宾曲，数百名中外来宾热烈鼓掌。整个宴会大厅里，充满了亲切的友好团结气氛。
    聂荣臻副总理在宴会上讲话说，在发展各国民族的、人民大众的科学事业中，四大洲的人民和科学家已经结成了伟大的、战斗的友谊。这次物理讨论会的召开，再一次显示了我们四大洲人民和科学家加强团结合作，发展民族的、人民大众的科学的决心。
    他指出，依靠和加强四大洲人民和科学家建立在平等互利、互相帮助、互相学习、共同提高的基础之上的互相合作，就可以打破帝国主义的垄断和控制，复兴和繁荣我们四大洲各国本民族和本国人民的科学事业。他说，我们四大洲人民摆脱殖民主义枷锁、获得民族独立以后，在发展民族科学、攀登世界科学高峰方面，一定能够赶上和超过西方帝国主义国家。
    聂荣臻副总理说，反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，是我们四大洲人民团结的基础。我们四大洲科学家的团结，是四大洲人民反美统一战线的一个重要组成部分。他说，中国人民遵循毛泽东主席的教导，一贯坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，坚决支持一切受美帝国主义侵略和欺负的国家和人民的反美爱国斗争。
    聂荣臻副总理最后说，中国人民和科学家，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵循毛泽东主席关于解放思想、破除迷信的教导，敢想、敢说、敢做、敢闯、敢革命，在发展自己的科学事业方面，坚决走自己的道路；同时，也一向遵循毛泽东主席的教导，认真地、虚心地学习各国人民在科学技术上所取得的成果和先进经验。这次物理讨论会的召开，为我国物理学界提供了一个良好的学习机会。我们一定很好地向各国科学家学习，我们也愿意把我们的研究成果提供给到会的各国科学家参考和探讨。
    越南科学家代表团团长魏如昆嵩在宴会上致词祝酒。他说，在当前越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的生死存亡的斗争中，正如刘少奇主席所宣布的，七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，中国辽阔的国土是越南人民的可靠后方。越中两国人民的坚强团结和战斗友谊是战胜美国侵略者的最可靠的保证。在胡志明主席的英明领导下，三千一百万越南人民满怀决胜的信心，紧握手中枪，决心奋起彻底打败美国侵略强盗。越南人民反美战争的胜利，也就是全世界进步人民的胜利，各国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义一定将被打败。他最后用中国话高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    在北京的外国著名科学家、和平人士和其他方面的朋友，也应邀出席宴会。他们当中有日本的西园寺公一，老挝的贵宁夫人，印度尼西亚的威利，泰国的帕荣，苏丹的凯尔，澳大利亚的射电天文学家克里斯琴森等。
    我国各有关方面的负责人廖承志、刘晓、韩光、楚图南、郝德青、刘子载，以周培源为首的中国科学家代表团全体成员，今晚都出席宴会作陪，同来自四大洲的各国科学家们亲切欢聚。
