    Chairman Mao and the Buyi People
    Buyi Community Member Wang Xianglin

    The sun has risen, the flowers in the green leaves are smiling;
    We, the Buyi people, miss our leader Chairman Mao.
    The sunlight shines into our homes,
    Chairman Mao is with the Buyi people!
    The rice is ripe, thousands of baskets are stored in the granary;
    We hold the new rice, thinking of our leader Chairman Mao.
    Chairman Mao is by our side,
    The Buyi people's days are sweet like this!

    毛主席和布朗人在一起
    布朗族社员　王香婻太阳出来了，绿叶中的花朵笑迷迷；我们布朗人，想念领袖毛主席。太阳的光芒照进我们的家，毛主席和布朗人在一起！稻谷成熟了，千箩万箩送进粮仓里；我们端着新米饭，想起领袖毛主席。毛主席就在我们身边啊，布朗人的日子才有这样甜蜜！
