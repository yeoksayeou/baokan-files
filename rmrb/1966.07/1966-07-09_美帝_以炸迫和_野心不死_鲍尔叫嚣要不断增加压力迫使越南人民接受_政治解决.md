The U.S. Empire's "Bombing to Force Peace" Ambitions Remain Unchanged

U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Ball Blusters About Continuing to Increase Pressure to Force the Vietnamese People to Accept a "Political Solution"

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated July 7: Washington news: U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Ball held a press conference on July 6, blustering that the United States will further engage in war blackmail against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attempting to force a "negotiated settlement."

Ball brazenly said, "We have always believed that military efforts help achieve a political solution, and today's attitude is the same." He shamelessly admitted that the U.S. bandits' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is another step the United States has taken "in the continuous increase of pressure."

A reporter asked Ball whether the United States would impose a "blockade" on oil tankers heading to North Vietnam. In his response, Ball admitted that after the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, there have been many suggestions about what actions the U.S. government can take next. "The one you mentioned is one of them."

Ball also pointed out that U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara is about to go to Honolulu to plan steps to escalate the war of aggression. He said that McNamara will discuss "all aspects of the struggle in South Vietnam."

To peddle the U.S. "negotiation" plot, Ball also strongly advocated for tightening ties with the Soviet revisionist clique, attempting to make a deal on the issue of "preventing nuclear proliferation."

He said that the United States has already proposed a draft treaty on "preventing nuclear proliferation" in Geneva and has been "continuously studying how to modify the wording to facilitate an agreement in Geneva." He also said, "If modifying the wording can solve the problem, this is obviously something we will do, and we will continue to do so."

    美帝“以炸迫和”野心不死
    鲍尔叫嚣要不断增加压力迫使越南人民接受“政治解决”
    据新华社七日讯　华盛顿消息：美国副国务卿鲍尔六日举行记者招待会，叫嚷美国要进一步对越南民主共和国进行战争讹诈，力图压出一个“和谈”来。
    鲍尔露骨地说，“我们一向认为军事努力有助于取得政治解决，今天的态度还是这样”。他厚颜无耻地承认，美国强盗轰炸河内与海防是美国在“不断增加压力方面采取的又一步骤”。
    有记者问鲍尔，美国是否会对驶往越南北方的油船实行“封锁”，鲍尔在回答时承认，在轰炸河内和海防以后关于美国政府“究竟可以再采取那些行动，这方面有许多建议。你提到的就是其中之一”。
    鲍尔还指出，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉即将前往檀香山，策划扩大侵略战争的步骤。他说，麦克纳马拉将就“南越斗争的一切方面”进行磋商。
    为了兜售美国的“和谈”阴谋，鲍尔还大力鼓吹同苏联修正主义集团加紧勾结，设法在“防止核扩散”问题上作成交易。
    他说，美国已经在日内瓦提出一个关于“防止核扩散”的条约草案，并且“一直在研究究竟怎样修改措词，以促使在日内瓦达成协议。”他还说，“如果修改一下措词就可以使问题得到解决，这显然是我们将会做的事，而且我们将继续这样做。”
