Young teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School enthusiastically celebrate the re-publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." They angrily refute the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought literary clique led by Zhou Yang.

A group of young teachers and students from the Shanghai Dance School expressed their excitement during a study meeting, stating that the ballet "White-Haired Girl" won the enthusiastic welcome of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, entirely due to Mao Zedong Thought. It was Mao Zedong Thought that pointed out the correct direction for ballet revolution, providing us with wisdom and strength. This allowed us to fearlessly and consistently fight against the revisionist literary thoughts of Zhou Yang and others, ultimately achieving victory.

The composer of "White-Haired Girl," Yan Jinxuan, said: The bourgeois "authorities" used phrases like "Swan Lake is the pinnacle of ballet art that cannot be surpassed" to intimidate us, preventing us from revolutionizing ballet. We are not afraid! We follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "use foreign for domestic" and "use ancient for modern," transforming foreign and classical ballet forms into revolutionary ballet. Based on Chairman Mao's statement that "there is only concrete humanity, not abstract humanity. In a class society, there is only class humanity, not some super-class humanity," we used class analysis to strive to create the towering images of revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants like Xier, Yang Bailao, Wang Dashun, and Zhao Dashu. When composing the music for this ballet, we also followed Chairman Mao's teachings, first considering revolutionary content and ensuring that workers, peasants, and soldiers could understand and accept it. We added a lot of singing to express the characters' thoughts and emotions, which was warmly welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In short, we relied on the powerful force of Mao Zedong Thought to create a revolutionary modern ballet that the decadent bourgeois ballet art could not match.

Yan Jinxuan also revealed in the meeting how a small clique of party and non-party bourgeois "authorities" and "experts" obstructed their efforts to create revolutionary ballet. She said: The bourgeois "authorities" shouted that "White-Haired Girl" was "too revolutionary," "too full of gunpowder," and "too class-conscious." We do not heed such nonsense. We say that proletarian literature and art must hoist the revolutionary banner high and sing revolutionary songs loudly; it must be full of gunpowder and bury all ghosts and snakes.

Yan Jinxuan also mentioned that even when they performed "White-Haired Girl" in Beijing this May, there were still people in the newspapers opposing the addition of singing in the ballet, claiming that "using language (i.e., singing) is a sign of the dancer's incompetence" and that it would not promote the ballet's ability to "refine and perfect the depiction of life." They said that adding a lot of singing would narrow the path of making the ballet revolutionary, national, and popular, believing that the main aspect of ballet is "not using singing and language." We were not influenced by these fallacies. We insisted on taking the broad road of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The workers, peasants, and soldiers said that adding singing made it easier to understand and had a greater educational effect, so we added singing and remained unwavering.

The performers of Xier, Gu Qiaomei, and the crowd, Zhang Dawei, said that the anti-party, anti-socialist literary black line leader, Zhou Yang, dared to advocate that literary and art workers should not accept the party's leadership and "not listen" to the party, saying that they should have "their own thoughts." This is a blatant incitement for literary and art workers to oppose the party's leadership and Mao Zedong Thought. Hearing this, it is truly infuriating. Zhou Yang's claim that the party's leadership has "low professional standards and low political standards" is a complete slander! Our revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl" was created from beginning to end under the party's wise leadership and the shining guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. When creating "White-Haired Girl," the party initially told us that to revolutionize ballet, we must rely on the masses and work together, not yearn for bourgeois "experts," and rely on highlighting Mao Zedong Thought, not be intimidated by techniques. The party's instructions helped us overcome all difficulties and achieve victory. During the creation of "White-Haired Girl," the party organization repeatedly gave us specific instructions: to stand firmly in the socialist era to handle the theme of "White-Haired Girl," to highlight class struggle, to show that where there is oppression and exploitation, there is resistance to oppression and exploitation, to highlight that political power comes from the barrel of a gun, and to express the idea of people's war. It was the party that taught us that poor and lower-middle peasants are the most resolute and thorough in their revolution in the countryside, and proletarian literary and art workers must strive to create heroic images of poor and lower-middle peasants. The party's teachings helped us deeply understand the theme of "White-Haired Girl," dare to recreate it based on the original opera, and dare to break free from the various constraints of Western bourgeois ballet art, transforming this art form, which had long served a small number of bourgeois, into a brand-new ballet art that is revolutionary and loved by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Participants in the discussion from the Shanghai Dance School's revolutionary teachers and students used Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as a revolutionary mirror to expose and criticize the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought literary "ancestors" led by Zhou Yang, who erased the class nature of literature and art and advocated the so-called "literature and art for all people." One of the directors of "White-Haired Girl," Fu Aidie, pointed out: The party's bourgeois representative in the literary and art field, Zhou Yang, from the 1930s advocating the surrenderist slogan of "National Defense Literature" to the 1960s advocating the revisionist proposal of "literature and art for all people," has consistently followed an anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black line. He advocated that literature and art should be "accepted by all kinds of people," that "all people are the objects of service," and that literature and art should "unite other classes (referring to non-proletarian classes)." This is pure revisionist nonsense. Zhou Yang's fallacies are to subvert the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers proposed by Mao Zedong, to advocate for a Khrushchev-style "literature and art for all people," and to prevent us from revolutionizing. Chairman Mao said: "You are a bourgeois literary and art worker, you do not sing the praises of the proletariat but sing the praises of the bourgeoisie; you are a proletarian literary and art worker, you do not sing the praises of the bourgeoisie but sing the praises of the proletariat and laboring people: the two must be one." Chairman Mao's words are like a mirror that exposes the true nature of Zhou Yang and others' revisionist literary and art thoughts. One of the performers of Xier's four friends, Zhang Meizhen, said that Chairman Mao taught us: "To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the army with guns. But having only this kind of army is not enough; we must also have a cultural army, which is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." Chairman Mao's words helped me further understand that if we do not deeply understand this truth, we will give the bourgeois a chance to open the door to restoration. Because all those who attempt to restore the bourgeoisie also know that to seize political power, they must rely on literature and art to prepare ideologically and spiritually. Therefore, we must use literary and art weapons to directly participate in the revolution, participate in the class struggle in the ideological realm, and defend the socialist homeland. Zhou Yang vigorously advocates that literary and art works "can have no political content" and emphasizes that literature and art should "satisfy their (referring to various classes) artistic appreciation requirements," which is a complete fallacy against Mao Zedong Thought. We firmly oppose this.

The performer of the underground party member Zhao Dashu in "White-Haired Girl," Kong Lingzhang, said that before the creation of this ballet, some so-called ballet "authorities" required us to first "study, understand, imitate, and perform well" Western bourgeois ballet, and then go on to reform it. This means that we should kneel before bourgeois art and not allow us to revolutionize. We do not heed their nonsense. Chairman Mao taught us: "The question of who serves whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." We firmly follow Chairman Mao's instructions, breaking through various foreign dogmas and frameworks, creating a revolutionary ballet that is loved by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We also deeply feel that only by serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics can literature and art play a great role in promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie, be accepted and utilized by workers, peasants, and soldiers, and become the art of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The young students participating in the creation and performance of "White-Haired Girl" also specially discussed a passage from Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "We literary and art workers of intellectual origin must change and reform our thoughts and emotions to make our works welcome by the masses. Without this change and reform, we cannot do anything well; we will be out of place." They unanimously agreed that from this precious instruction of Chairman Mao, we more clearly understand that only by going to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, constantly reforming our thoughts, gradually shifting our standpoint to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to the side of the proletariat, can we become revolutionaries and truly serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. One of the performers of Xier, Cai Guoying, said that recalling the early rehearsals of "White-Haired Girl," I did not have the class feelings of a poor peasant girl Xier but only imitated the image of Xier from the movie "White-Haired Girl," so I did not portray the fighting character of a poor peasant girl deeply oppressed by the class. Initially, I thought it was because my technique was not good enough and I had difficulties. Later, the leadership and comrades told me that the technique was not difficult; the biggest difficulty was the lack of deep class feelings. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome all difficulties and achieve victory. Later, I participated in the socialist education movement in the countryside with everyone, and my thoughts and emotions changed somewhat. I felt the poor and lower-middle peasants' clear hatred and love, firm stance, and resolute struggle, which gave me great education. Later, during rehearsals, I no longer felt that Xier was a rabbit about to be eaten by a tiger in front of the enemy but felt the enemy's insignificance and that Xier was the representative of several hundred million peasants deeply oppressed by the class in old China, a fearless hero who dared to fight and win. This made me perform with immense hatred towards the class enemy and my body full of revolutionary strength.

Many young students participating in the performance of "White-Haired Girl" also unanimously expressed that in the future, they will definitely study "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" better, use this invincible revolutionary ideological weapon to distinguish between flowers and weeds, discern who is a true revolutionary and who is a false revolutionary, and fiercely refute Zhou Yang and others' revisionist arguments against literary and art workers participating in labor practice and against literary and art workers deeply entering the lives and struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers to reform their worldviews. They are determined to actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further deeply enter the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, constantly reform their thoughts, become unyielding revolutionary literary and art warriors, and become successors of Mao Zedong Thought.

    上海舞蹈学校青年师生欢呼《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》重新发表
    毛泽东思想给我们开辟了为工农兵服务的广阔道路
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的诞生是粉碎了周扬黑帮疯狂破坏的巨大胜利
    新华社上海八日电  参加革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》创作和演出的上海市舞蹈学校青年师生，热烈欢呼毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》重新发表，愤怒驳斥以周扬为首的资产阶级、修正主义的文艺黑帮。
    上海市舞蹈学校的一些青年师生在学习座谈会上都激动地表示，芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》所以赢得广大工农兵群众极其热烈的欢迎，完完全全应该归功于毛泽东思想。是毛泽东思想给我们指出了芭蕾革命的正确方向，给了我们智慧和力量，使我们能无所畏惧地始终和周扬等人的修正主义文艺思想展开不调和的斗争，并取得了胜利。
    《白毛女》作曲者严金萱说：资产阶级“权威”用“《天鹅湖》是芭蕾艺术不可逾越的顶峰”之类的鬼话来吓唬我们，不许我们闹芭蕾革命。我们不怕！我们听毛主席的话，遵照毛主席指示的“外为中用”、“古为今用”的原则，把外来的、古典的芭蕾艺术形式改造成为革命的芭蕾。我们根据毛主席所说的“只有具体的人性，没有抽象的人性。在阶级社会里就是只有带着阶级性的人性，而没有什么超阶级的人性”这一真理，运用阶级分析的方法，努力塑造了喜儿、杨白劳、王大春、赵大叔等革命的贫下中农的高大形象。我们在写这个舞剧的音乐时，也遵循毛主席的教导，首先考虑的是从革命内容出发，从工农兵群众听得懂、容易接受出发，并且加了大量伴唱，来表现人物的思想感情，受到工农兵观众热烈的欢迎。一句话，我们靠了毛泽东思想的强大威力，创造了没落颓废的资产阶级芭蕾艺术所无法比拟的革命现代芭蕾舞剧。
    严金萱还在座谈会上揭露一小撮党内外资产阶级“权威”“专家”阻止他们搞革命芭蕾舞的罪行。她说：资产阶级“权威”叫嚷什么《白毛女》“太革命了”，“火药味太浓了”，“阶级性太多了”，我们不理这些鬼话。我们说，无产阶级的文艺就是要高高举起革命大旗，大唱特唱革命战歌；就是要把火药味搞得浓浓的，把一切牛鬼蛇神统统埋葬。
    严金萱还说，直到我们今年五月在北京演出《白毛女》时，还有人在报上反对我们在这个舞剧中加大量伴唱，胡说什么“使用语言（即伴唱）是舞蹈者无能的表现”，不能促进“芭蕾舞蹈精益求精表现生活的能力”，说什么大量伴唱使芭蕾舞剧革命化、民族化和群众化的路走得不“宽”了，认为芭蕾舞剧主要的还是“不使用歌唱和语言”。我们没有受这些谬论的影响，我们坚持走为工农兵群众服务的广阔道路。工农兵说，加伴唱听得懂，教育作用大，我们就加伴唱，决不动摇。
    《白毛女》剧中扮演喜儿的顾峡美和扮演群众的张大为说，反党反社会主义文艺黑线的首领周扬，胆敢叫嚣文艺工作者不要接受党的领导，“不听”党的话，说什么要有“自己的思想”，这是明目张胆地煽动文艺工作者起来反对党的领导，反对毛泽东思想。听了这话，实在令人气愤。周扬胡说什么党的领导“业务水平不高，政治水平也不高”，这完全是诬蔑！我们的革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，自始至终是在党的英明领导下，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下创作出来的。在创作《白毛女》的时候，是党一开始就告诉我们，闹芭蕾革命要依靠群众，大家动手，不要去向往那些资产阶级“专家”，要靠突出毛泽东思想，不要被那些技巧吓倒。党的指示，使我们排除万难，夺取了胜利。在我们创作《白毛女》的过程中，党组织又多次具体指示我们：要立足社会主义时代来处理《白毛女》的主题思想，要突出阶级斗争，表现哪里有压迫、有剥削，哪里就有反压迫、反剥削，要突出枪杆子里出政权，表现人民战争的思想。是党教导我们，贫下中农在农村中革命最坚决、最彻底，无产阶级文艺工作者就是要努力塑造贫下中农的英雄形象。党对我们的这些教导，使我们对《白毛女》的主题思想有了深刻的认识，敢于在原歌剧的基础上进行再创造，更敢于冲破西方资产阶级芭蕾艺术的种种束缚，把这种长期为少数资产阶级服务的艺术形式加以脱胎换骨的改造，变成革命的为广大工农兵所喜爱的崭新的芭蕾艺术。
    参加座谈的上海市舞蹈学校的革命师生，纷纷用毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这一革命的照妖镜，揭发和批判了反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的文艺“祖师爷”周扬抹煞文艺的阶级性、鼓吹所谓“全民文艺”的反动观点。《白毛女》的编导之一傅艾棣指出：窃据文艺界领导的党内资产阶级代表人物周扬，从三十年代鼓吹投降主义的“国防文学”口号，到六十年代鼓吹修正主义的“全民文艺”的主张，贯串着一条反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑线。他鼓吹什么文艺要“为各种人接受”，“全国人民都是服务的对象”，文艺要“把其他阶级（按：指非无产阶级）也团结起来”，这是道道地地的修正主义货色。周扬这种谬论，就是要篡改毛主席提出的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，就是要提倡赫鲁晓夫式的“全民文艺”，就是叫我们不要革命。毛主席说：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”毛主席的话象照妖镜一样，从骨子里照透了周扬等人这种修正主义文艺思想的真面目。喜儿的四女友扮演者之一张美珍说，毛主席教导我们：“我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”毛主席的话使我进一步体会到，如果不深刻认识这一真理，就会给资产阶级打开复辟的缺口。因为一切妄图复辟的资产阶级野心家，他们也懂得，要夺取政权，就要依靠文艺从思想上、精神上作舆论准备。所以，我们就是要用文艺武器直接参加革命，参加意识形态领域的阶级斗争，保卫社会主义江山。周扬竭力鼓吹文艺作品“可以没有政治内容”，强调文艺要“满足他们的（按：指各阶级）艺术欣赏的要求”，这完全是反毛泽东思想的谬论。我们坚决反对。
    《白毛女》中扮演地下党员赵大叔的孔令璋说，《白毛女》这个舞剧开始创作前，一些所谓芭蕾舞的“权威”，曾经要求我们先要对西方资产阶级的芭蕾舞“学深、学透、学象、演好”，然后再去改造。这就是说，要我们拜倒在资产阶级艺术的脚下，不准我们革命，我们根本不理睬他们这一套。毛主席教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”我们坚决按照毛主席的指示，打破了种种洋教条、洋框框，创造了为广大工农兵群众所喜闻乐见的革命芭蕾舞剧。我们还深深感到：只有为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，文艺才能发挥兴无灭资的巨大作用，才能为工农兵所接受、所利用，才能成为工农兵自己的艺术。
    参加《白毛女》创作和演出的青年学生，还特别谈到了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中的这样一段话：“我们知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”他们一致认为，从毛主席这一宝贵的指示中，更清楚地认识到，只有长期到工农兵群众中去，不断改造思想，逐渐把立足点移到工农兵方面来，移到无产阶级方面来，做革命人，才能演好革命戏，才能真正为工农兵服务。喜儿扮演者之一蔡国英说，回忆开始排练《白毛女》时，我没有贫农喜儿那样的阶级感情，只是模仿电影《白毛女》中的喜儿形象来表演，所以把深受阶级压迫的贫农女儿的斗争性格刻划得不够坚强。当初，我曾经认为是自己技术不过硬，有困难，后来，领导上和同志们告诉我，技术不难，缺乏深厚的阶级感情才是最大的困难，有了毛泽东思想，就能排除万难，取得胜利。以后，我和大家一起参加了农村社会主义教育运动，思想感情起了一些变化。我感受到贫下中农爱憎分明，立场坚定，斗争坚决，给了我很大的教育。以后排练时，我再也不象以前那样觉得喜儿在敌人面前是将被老虎吃掉的兔子，而是感到敌人的渺小，感到喜儿是旧中国深受阶级压迫的几亿农民的代表，是敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏的英雄，使我在演出时满怀着对阶级敌人的无比憎恨，浑身充满着革命的力量。
    参加《白毛女》演出的许多青年学生，还一致表示：今后，一定要更好地学习《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，用这个战无不胜的革命思想武器，去辨别香花和毒草，鉴别谁是真革命，谁是假革命，狠狠地痛斥周扬等人反对文艺工作者参加劳动锻炼，反对文艺工作者深入到工农兵群众生活和斗争中去改造世界观等修正主义论调，彻底打倒一切牛鬼蛇神。他们决心积极投入无产阶级文化大革命，进一步深入到工农兵群众中去，不断地改造思想，做永不变色的革命文艺战士，做毛泽东思想的接班人。
