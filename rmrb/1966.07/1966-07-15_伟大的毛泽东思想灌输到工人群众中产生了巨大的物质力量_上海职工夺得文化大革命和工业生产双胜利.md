The great thoughts of Mao Zedong infused into the masses of workers have produced enormous material force. Shanghai workers have achieved double victories in the Cultural Revolution and industrial production.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee has called on all levels of leadership in the industrial sector to seize the current momentum of the Cultural Revolution, grasp the class struggle, and use the Cultural Revolution as a powerful force to promote the thought revolution of the people, pushing forward all production and business work.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 14 - Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of workers in Shanghai have achieved double victories in the Cultural Revolution and industrial production in the first half of this year. In the Cultural Revolution, the class consciousness of the workers has rapidly increased, their revolutionary spirit is extremely high, and their spiritual force has been transformed into enormous material force, driving the movement to increase production and reduce waste, with a focus on improving product quality and developing product varieties, to develop more deeply and healthily.

The broad masses of workers are holding a pen in one hand and a hammer in the other, with high spirits, determined to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution to the end, a revolution that concerns the fate and future of our Party and state, and the fate and future of the world revolution; at the same time, resolutely carry out production well, striving to make Shanghai, this old industrial base, make greater contributions to the country during the third five-year plan.

In the first half of the year, the industrial production situation in Shanghai is very good. By the end of June, the total industrial output value of the city has completed 51% of the annual plan, with a significant increase compared to the same period last year. The industrial production of the city has continued to rise steadily. The output of important products urgently needed by the state, such as steel, steel materials, metal cutting machine tools, three-wheeled trucks, walk-behind tractors, fertilizers, pesticides, plastics, dyes, cotton yarn, paper, and paperboard, has increased significantly compared to the same period last year, with some increasing by more than onefold. The quality of major products has been largely stable, with a small part improving over the best quality of the fourth quarter last year, and a number of major new products have been successfully trial-produced. Profits remitted to the state have increased, and costs have been reduced. The effects of saving coal, timber, electricity, metal materials, and chemical raw materials are remarkable. All this eloquently shows that by grasping the revolution and promoting production, and by actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, infusing Chairman Mao's thoughts into the masses of workers, an incredibly great material force can be produced. The Cultural Revolution has rapidly promoted the further revolutionization of the workforce and powerfully driven industrial production forward.

Since this year, the masses of workers in Shanghai have had an unprecedented strong awareness of the need to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works; their enthusiasm for learning has reached an unprecedented high; and the scale of learning has been unprecedentedly broad. In the Cultural Revolution, they have used Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful and sharpest weapon, to sweep away all ghosts and snakes, to open fire on all representatives of the bourgeoisie, and to powerfully impact old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, breaking the spiritual shackles that bind the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm, sweeping away evil winds and promoting revolutionary spirit. All this has formed an extremely powerful force driving production forward. Many new products with a 1960s level have been successfully trial-produced; some long-standing quality problems have been solved; more new technologies, new materials, new technologies, new equipment, and new designs have been applied to production more quickly; and some long-standing issues of concern to the masses have been solved in a few days. The great revolutionary spirit of the workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, which has burst forth in the Cultural Revolution, is rapidly changing the face of Shanghai's industrial production. They can create any conditions, overcome any difficulties, and accomplish any task!

The idea of being complacent and doing nothing in improving quality and developing varieties has been strongly impacted. Most of Shanghai's industrial products have already met or exceeded quality standards. Since this year, the workers of many factories have set higher standards for themselves, striving for higher levels, constantly finding gaps from domestic and international advanced levels, from user requirements, and from the latest achievements of scientific research. Recently, important products such as 25,000-kilowatt steam turbines, electronic potentiometers, car engines, agricultural submersible pumps, lecithin, and fiberboard have seen their quality leap to a new level.

Some factories in the paper, rubber, and textile industries have faced some unfavorable influences on production due to changes in raw material conditions. The workers, after studying Chairman Mao's discussions on the transformation of contradictions in "On Contradiction," have decided to turn disadvantages into advantages. They said that inferior raw materials are a good opportunity to temper their skills, and actively explored the production laws of new raw materials, overcoming difficulties in a short time and producing qualified products with inferior raw materials. In the current Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have crushed the arrogance of bourgeois technical "experts" and "authorities," seized their power, and their revolutionary pioneering spirit is even more soaring. They dare to compete with the strongest in the world's technology, and their confidence in catching up with and surpassing the most advanced level of science and technology is even stronger. According to the analysis of 264 new products from 58 machinery, electrical, and instrument factories, independently designed and learned-created products have exceeded 90% of the total, a significant increase from last year. This situation shows that the Shanghai working class, armed with the great thoughts of Mao Zedong, is truly a thorough revolutionary who dares to break and dare to establish, fearing nothing. They not only thoroughly break the old situation where bourgeois technical "authorities" and "experts" monopolize the scientific and technological front, but also act as the vanguard in climbing the technological peak. They have opened up a broad path for the development of technology according to Mao Zedong Thought through their practice.

What the bourgeois technical "experts" dare not do, the workers do; what the bourgeois technical "authorities" cannot do, the workers do. The bourgeois technical "authorities" and "experts" have been overthrown, and the young technical personnel and workers have taken on the responsibility. Now, more and more workers are directly participating in product design. Some factories have hired workers as part-time designers, and some factories have selected production workers to join design teams. These new worker design teams, with the mandate of the class, full of class feelings, repeatedly study Chairman Mao's "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and related quotations, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, break foreign frameworks and foreign dogmas, insist on practice, insist on scientific experiments, and the new products they design have distinct Chinese characteristics. This year, the Shanghai Refining Plant has completed 26 out of 36 new products it undertook to trial-produce in the first half of the year.

In the Cultural Revolution, Shanghai industrial enterprises have become more determined to run industry according to Mao Zedong Thought. In the first half of the year, the workers have more consciously insisted on Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead, putting the needs of the state and the people first. Currently, some factory workers have begun to criticize the entire set of reactionary fallacies of profit-first and money-first advocated by Sun Yefang and others, further clarifying their vision. Since this year, the broad masses of workers have more consciously insisted on implementing the policy of quality first, more for less, faster for more, and saving for more. The workers believe that whether an enterprise insists on quality first is an important sign of whether it has a socialist management ideology or a capitalist management ideology, and a sharp struggle between running industry according to Mao Zedong Thought and running industry according to capitalist thoughts. At any time, quality first must be insisted on. Quality is the greatest savings. When quality and variety conflict with production and cannot be unified for the time being, quality and variety take precedence; when quality and variety conflict with savings and cannot be unified for the time being, savings serve quality and variety. Each enterprise must produce based on the needs of the state and the people, constantly tap internal potential, actively increase the production of key products urgently needed by the state, and actively complete key projects to catch up with and surpass advanced levels.

Currently, Shanghai is in the midst of a high tide of the Cultural Revolution and a new high tide of industrial production. All indications show that to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end and to push the new high tide of industrial production to a new peak, the key is to further actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. In the struggles of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, the broad masses of workers have increasingly deeply realized that Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most active Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought reflects the objective laws of domestic and international class struggle and reflects the fundamental interests of our proletariat and working people. The workers say, by seriously reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, people will have red hearts and bright eyes, clear directions, stable stands, be the smartest and bravest, conquer any difficulties, dare to climb any peak, work better and better, and achieve one victory after another.

Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Committee has instructed the leadership of the industrial front to seize the current momentum of the Cultural Revolution, grasp the class struggle, use the Cultural Revolution as a powerful force to promote all production and business work, boldly lead the production struggle, and seriously carry out production. In production, quality and variety should be put first, efforts should be made to complete the key tasks assigned to Shanghai by the state, and scientific research, new product trial production, and design work should be vigorously promoted. The more enthusiastic the masses of workers are, the more the cadres should care about the lives of the masses, pay attention to the combination of work and rest, and strive to fully complete and overfulfill the tasks assigned to Shanghai by the state.

Now, the enthusiasm of the workers on the industrial front in Shanghai is even greater, and their passion is even higher. Many department and factory leaders, according to the instructions of the Municipal Committee, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and have further strengthened their leadership. The masses of workers are determined to even higher raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership of various levels of Party organizations, to fight a brilliant battle in the Cultural Revolution, and to fight a brilliant battle in the production struggle and scientific experiment.

Shanghai Electric Furnace Factory workers follow Chairman Mao's teachings, liberate their minds, break superstitions, and recently, with the cooperation of other units, successfully trial-produced an electronic bombardment furnace with a 1960s world technology level.

　　伟大的毛泽东思想灌输到工人群众中产生了巨大的物质力量
　　上海职工夺得文化大革命和工业生产双胜利
    上海市委要求工业战线各级领导，乘当前无产阶级文化大革命的东风，抓住阶级斗争的纲，把无产阶级文化大革命作为促进人的思想革命化，推动各项生产、业务工作的巨大动力。
    新华社上海十四日电　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进的上海广大职工，今年上半年取得了无产阶级文化大革命和工业生产的双胜利。职工群众在无产阶级文化大革命中，阶级觉悟迅速提高，革命精神极为昂扬，精神力量转化成为巨大的物质力量，推动着以提高产品质量、发展产品品种为中心的增产节约运动更深入、更健康地向前发展。
    广大职工一手拿笔杆，一手拿鎯头，斗志昂扬地表示：一定以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，坚决把这场关系到我们党和国家命运和前途、关系到世界革命命运和前途的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；同时，坚决把关系到我国社会主义建设、工农业生产和城乡人民生活的生产搞好，力争使上海这个老工业基地，在第三个五年计划期间，对国家作出更大贡献。
    上半年，上海工业生产形势很好。到六月底为止，全市工业总产值已完成年度计划的百分之五十一，比去年同期有较大幅度的增长。全市工业生产持续稳步上升，国家急需的重要产品，如钢、钢材、金属切削机床、三轮卡车、手扶拖拉机、化肥、农药、塑料、染料、棉纱、纸及纸版等，产量都比去年同期有较多的增长，有的增长一倍以上。主要产品的质量，绝大部分稳定，一小部分比去年质量最好的第四季度又有提高，并且试制成功一批重大新产品。上缴利润增加，成本下降。煤炭、木材、电力、金属材料、化工原料等节约效果显著。这一切雄辩地说明，抓革命促生产，通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人群众中去，就会产生无比巨大的物质力量。无产阶级文化大革命，迅猛地促进了职工队伍进一步革命化，有力地推动着工业生产向前跃进。
    今年以来，上海职工群众活学活用毛主席著作的自觉要求，空前强烈；学习的积极性，空前高涨；学习的规模，空前广泛。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们以毛泽东思想这一最强大、最锐利的武器，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，向一切资产阶级代表人物开火，也有力地冲击着旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，打破了束缚群众革命积极性的精神枷锁，歪风邪气扫地，革命正气大兴。这一切形成了一股推动生产前进的极其强大的力量。许多具有六十年代水平的重大新产品试制成功了；一些质量上的“老大难”问题解决了；更多的新工艺、新材料、新技术、新设备、新设计更快地用于生产了；一些拖了很久、群众关心的切身问题，几天之内就解决了。用毛泽东思想武装起来的职工群众在无产阶级文化大革命中迸发出来的巨大的革命精神，正迅速改变着上海工业生产的面貌，什么条件他们都可以创造，什么困难都可以克服，什么事情都可以办好！
    那种在提高质量、发展品种上安于现状、无所作为的思想，受到猛烈的冲击。上海的工业产品，绝大部分已经符合和超过质量标准。今年以来，许多厂的职工以更高标准要求自己，向更高水平前进，不断从国内外先进水平中找差距，从用户要求中找差距，从科学研究的最新成果中找差距。最近，二万五千瓩汽轮机、电子电位差计、轿车的发动机、农用潜水电泵、乐果，以及纤维板等重要产品，质量又跃升到一个新的水平。
    造纸、橡胶、纺织行业的一些工厂，由于原料条件的变化，给生产带来一些不利的影响。职工群众学习了毛主席在《矛盾论》中有关矛盾转化的论述，决心变不利为有利。他们说，原料差，正是锻炼过硬本领的好机会，就积极摸索新原料的生产规律，在较短时间内克服了困难，用较次的原料生产出了合格的产品。在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，广大职工群众以毛泽东思想为武器，灭了资产阶级技术
  “专家”、“权威”的威风，夺了他们的权，革命的首创精神更加高昂，敢于同世界技术中最强者较量的革命精神更加发扬，赶上和超过一切最先进的科学技术水平的信心更足了。根据对五十八家机电、仪表等工厂的二百六十四项新产品的分析，独立设计和学创结合的产品，已超过总数的百分之九十，比去年有很大提高。这一情况表明，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的上海工人阶级，真正是敢破敢立、无所畏惧的彻底革命派，他们不仅大破一切资产阶级技术“权威”“专家”霸占科学技术阵地的旧局面，而且充当攀登技术顶峰的急先锋。他们用自己的实践，开辟出一条按毛泽东思想发展技术的广阔道路。
    资产阶级技术“专家”不敢干的，工人群众自己干；资产阶级技术“权威”做不到的，工人群众做到了。资产阶级技术“权威”、“专家”被打倒了，年轻的技术人员和工人把担子挑起来。现在，有越来越多的工人群众直接参加了产品的设计。有的厂聘请工人为业余设计员，有的厂抽调生产工人参加设计小组。这些新的工人设计队伍，带着阶级的委托，满怀阶级感情，反复学习毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》和有关语录，以毛泽东思想为武器，大破洋框框洋教条，坚持实践，坚持科学实验，设计的新产品具有鲜明的中国特色。今年，上海炼油厂承担试制的三十六项新产品，上半年已经完成了二十六项。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，上海工业企业按照毛泽东思想办工业的方向更加坚定了。上半年，职工群众更自觉地坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，把国家需要、人民的需要放在第一位。当前，有的厂职工开始批判孙冶方等人一整套的利润挂帅、钞票挂帅的修正主义反动谬论，进一步擦亮了眼睛。今年以来，广大职工群众更自觉地坚持执行好字当头、好中求多、好中求快、好中求省的方针。职工们认定，一个企业是不是坚持好字当头，这是社会主义经营思想还是资本主义经营思想的一个重要标志，是按照毛泽东思想办工业还是按照资本主义思想办工业两条道路尖锐的斗争。任何时候，都要坚持好字当头。质量好是最大的节约。如果质量品种和产量发生矛盾一时不能统一的时候，以质量品种为主；质量品种和节约发生矛盾一时不能统一的时候，节约服从质量品种。每个企业，生产必须从国家需要、人民需要出发，不断挖掘内部潜力，积极增产国家急需的重点产品，积极完成赶超先进水平的重点项目。
    当前，上海正处在无产阶级文化大革命高潮之中，正处在工业生产新高潮之中。一切情况表明，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，要把工业生产新高潮推向一个新的高峰，关键在于进一步活学活用毛主席著作。在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验中，广大职工越来越深刻地认识到，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想，反映了国内国际阶级斗争的客观规律，反映了我们无产阶级、劳动人民的根本利益。职工们说，认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，人就心红眼亮，方向明，站得稳，最聪明，最勇敢，任何困难能征服，任何高峰敢攀登，工作会越做越好，斗争就能取得一个又一个胜利。
    最近，中共上海市委指示上海工业战线各级领导，要乘当前无产阶级文化大革命的东风，抓住阶级斗争的纲，把无产阶级文化大革命作为推动各项生产、业务工作的巨大动力，大胆领导生产斗争，认真地把生产搞好。在生产方面，要把质量品种放在第一位，要努力完成国家交给上海的重点任务，要大力抓紧科学研究、新产品试制和设计工作。职工群众的积极性越是高涨，干部越是要关心群众的生活，注意劳逸结合，力争全面完成和超额完成国家交给上海的任务。
    现在，上海工业战线职工群众干劲更大，热情更高。不少部门和工厂领导干部根据市委指示，相信群众，依靠群众，进一步加强了领导。职工群众决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在各级党组织的领导下，在无产阶级文化大革命中打个漂亮仗，在生产斗争和科学实验中打个漂亮仗。（附图片）
