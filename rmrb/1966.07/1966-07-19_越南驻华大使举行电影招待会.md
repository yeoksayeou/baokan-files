Representatives from various relevant sectors in China, including Wu Xiuquan, Han Nianlong, Ding Xilin, Li Qiang, Shi Huibing, Pan Zhenwu, Zhang Tianmin, and Sun Xiaocun, were invited to attend the event.

Deputy Head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Nguyen Minh Phuong, also attended the screening.

During the event, the documentary film "Heroic Hon Giao Island" and the feature film "Sea of Fire" were shown. Hon Giao Island is located at the forefront of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's resistance against American aggression. The U.S. imperialists have repeatedly bombed the island. The film documents the heroic deeds of the Vietnamese People's Army defending Hon Giao Island, fiercely striking back at the American aggressors, and safeguarding every inch of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's territory under the relentless bombing by U.S. imperialism. The indomitable fighting spirit of the Vietnamese military and civilians was highly praised by the audience.
