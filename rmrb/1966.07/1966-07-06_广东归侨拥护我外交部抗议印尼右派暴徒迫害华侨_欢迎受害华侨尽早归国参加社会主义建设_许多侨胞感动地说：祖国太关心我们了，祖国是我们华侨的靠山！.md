Guangdong's returned overseas Chinese strongly support the Chinese Foreign Ministry's protest against the persecution of overseas Chinese by Indonesian right-wing thugs. They welcome the early return of the victims to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Many overseas Chinese have been moved to say: "The motherland cares so much for us! The motherland is our overseas Chinese's backbone!"

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 5th: The returned overseas Chinese in Guangdong Province pointed out that the note sent by the Chinese Foreign Ministry to the Indonesian Embassy in China on June 29th spoke the hearts of millions of overseas Chinese and fully reflected the motherland's concern for the overseas Chinese in Indonesia who have been harmed. They resolutely demand that the Indonesian government immediately stop all persecution of overseas Chinese and ensure that the victims who wish to return to the motherland can return as soon as possible and smoothly.

On July 2nd, returned overseas Chinese representatives from Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City held a meeting in Guangzhou. The meeting was presided over by the Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Yi Meihou. Vice Chairman Huang Jie of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and Chairman Fang Junzhuang of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese both spoke at the meeting. They firmly support the note from the Chinese Foreign Ministry and strongly protest the new fascist anti-China atrocity committed by Indonesian right-wing thugs on June 28th, attacking the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and assaulting Chinese diplomats. They demanded that the Indonesian government immediately apologize and punish the culprits. In their speeches, they also, on behalf of the returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, expressed cordial greetings to the broad patriotic overseas Chinese who are suffering in Indonesia and welcomed them to return to the motherland as soon as possible to contribute to the great socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

In recent days, many Indonesian returned overseas Chinese in Guangzhou have refuted the lies of the Indonesian government with their personal experiences and observations, such as the claim that they "protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese" and that "no overseas Chinese have requested to return to the motherland." They pointed out that the Indonesian right-wing thugs in cities and rural areas in Indonesia have looted and burned many overseas Chinese shops and homes, causing many overseas Chinese to lose their livelihoods. Just from the various rural areas of Bali Island, hundreds of overseas Chinese have fled to the Chinese General Association and other overseas Chinese organizations for refuge. Now, there are thousands of overseas Chinese on Bali Island waiting to return to the motherland. There are also thousands of overseas Chinese on Sumatra Island who have been persecuted by right-wing reactionary forces and are urgently waiting for the motherland to send ships to bring them back. Returned overseas Chinese from Medan pointed out that Indonesian right-wing thugs killed more than twenty overseas Chinese in one day in the area, and more than four hundred overseas Chinese were injured. Many overseas Chinese even had their houses demolished by right-wing thugs. This is what the Indonesian government calls "protecting overseas Chinese." Tan Xianshan, a worker from the Guangzhou Electrical Appliance and Hardware Factory who returned from Indonesia in 1957, said that his sister and brother are still in Indonesia, and the overseas Chinese in their residential areas have been looted by Indonesian right-wing thugs in the anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese reverse tide, and they are urgently requesting to return to the motherland. He and his mother are also eagerly waiting for their relatives to escape from suffering and return to the motherland for reunification. The Indonesian government fabricates lies that overseas Chinese do not want to return to the motherland, simply to evade their responsibility for obstructing and destroying China's rescue of the victims. Their request for China to provide a list of overseas Chinese who wish to return to the motherland is nothing more than to further persecute overseas Chinese. Xiao Hong, a student who returned from Indonesia in June, said: "When our government sent a note to the Indonesian government on May 18th to send ships to bring back the victims, I had not yet returned to the motherland. Many of my relatives and friends heard the news on the radio and were so happy that they jumped up. Some people had tears in their eyes and said, 'The motherland cares so much for us overseas Chinese!' 'Socialist motherland is indeed a powerful backbone for overseas Chinese!' Since then, everyone has been eagerly waiting for the motherland's ships to arrive. However, the Indonesian government has created various excuses to try to obstruct the victims from returning to the motherland according to their own wishes, which is truly despicable."

The returned overseas Chinese pointed out that with a powerful socialist motherland as a backbone, the era of overseas Chinese being bullied by others has passed. The atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces against overseas Chinese will surely be thoroughly settled one day, and the victims who wish to return to the motherland will surely break through all obstacles and return to the motherland's embrace.

    广东归侨拥护我外交部抗议印尼右派暴徒迫害华侨
    欢迎受害华侨尽早归国参加社会主义建设
    许多侨胞感动地说：祖国太关心我们了，祖国是我们华侨的靠山！
    据新华社广州五日电  广东省的归国华侨们指出，我国外交部六月二十九日给印度尼西亚驻中国大使馆的照会，说出了千万华侨的心里话，充分体现了祖国对印度尼西亚受害华侨的关怀。他们坚决要求印度尼西亚政府立即停止对华侨的一切迫害，并保证自愿返国的受害华侨能够尽快顺利地回到祖国。
    广东省、广州市的归侨代表二日在广州举行了集会。大会由广东省归国华侨联合会主席蚁美厚主持。广东省侨联副主席黄洁、广州市侨联主席方君壮都在会上发言，他们坚决拥护我国外交部的照会，并且对印度尼西亚右派暴徒在六月二十八日袭扰我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆，扑打中国外交官员的法西斯反华新暴行表示强烈的抗议，要求印度尼西亚政府立即道歉惩凶。他们在发言中还代表广东省、广州市归国华侨和侨眷，对正在印度尼西亚横遭迫害的广大爱国华侨表示亲切的慰问，并且欢迎他们早日回到祖国，在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，为祖国伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业作出贡献。
    在广州的许多印度尼西亚归侨，这几天用他们亲身经历和目睹的事实，驳斥了印度尼西亚政府所谓“保护华侨生命财产”和“没有华侨提出回国要求”的无耻谎言。他们指出，印度尼西亚右派暴徒在印度尼西亚的城市和乡村里把许多华侨的商店、住宅抢光、烧光，使广大华侨丧失生计，仅从巴厘岛各地乡村跑到巴塘中华总会和其它华侨社团容身的华侨，就有好几百人。现在，巴厘岛上就有上千的华侨等待回国。苏门答腊岛上也有几千名华侨被右派反动势力迫害得生活无着，急待祖国派船接运返国。棉兰的归侨指出，印度尼西亚右派暴徒一次在当地一天就杀死了二十多名华侨，另外有四百多名华侨受伤。许多华侨连房子都被右派暴徒拆光，这就是印度尼西亚政府所谓“保护华侨”的所作所为。一九五七年从印度尼西亚归国的广州电器五金制造厂工人谭显南说，他的姐姐和弟弟等都还在印度尼西亚，他们侨居地区的华侨在印度尼西亚右派暴徒掀起的反华排华逆流中，遭到右派暴徒的洗劫，都迫切要求返回祖国，他和他的母亲也日夜盼望自己的亲人早日脱离苦海，回国团聚。印度尼西亚政府捏造什么华侨不愿回国的谎言，无非是要抵赖他们阻挠和破坏我国接运受害华侨的罪责，他们要求我国提供自愿返国的华侨名单，也不外是要对华侨进一步进行迫害。六月间从印度尼西亚回国的学生萧红说：“我国政府五月十八日向印度尼西亚政府提出派船接运受害华侨回国的照会时，我还未动身回国，我的许多亲戚朋友从收音机里一听到这个消息，都高兴得跳起来，有的人热泪盈眶地说：‘祖国太关心我们华侨了！’‘社会主义祖国真是华侨有力的靠山！’此后，大家天天都在焦急地盼望着祖国的船只到来。但是，印度尼西亚政府竟然制造种种借口，妄图阻挠受害华侨根据自己的意愿返回祖国，真是卑鄙无耻”。
    归侨们指出，有强大的社会主义祖国做靠山，海外华侨任人宰割的时代已经一去不复返。印度尼西亚右派反动势力迫害华侨的暴行终有被彻底清算的一天，自愿回国的印度尼西亚受害华侨，终将冲破重重障碍，回到祖国的怀抱。
