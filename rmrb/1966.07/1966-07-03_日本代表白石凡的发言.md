Japanese representative Shiraishi Bann today at the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers condemned the splitist activities of Soviet splitists in the Asian and African writers' movement.

Shiraishi Bann said, "This Beijing meeting has the urgent and sacred task and great significance of consolidating the friendship and unity of writers throughout the Asian and African region and supporting the Vietnamese people in their struggle. However, just as the meeting is about to convene, Soviet splitists illegally carried out sabotage against this emergency meeting in Cairo. Not only that, they also publicly issued a statement, sabotaging the only legitimate organization of Asian and African writers fighting against imperialism, old and new colonialism, for national independence, peace, and democracy—the Asian and African Writers' Conference." Shiraishi Bann said, "We strongly condemn this splitist action with indignation."

In his speech, Shiraishi Bann also condemned the crimes of American imperialism in vigorously reviving Japanese militarism. He said that the Japanese people are waging an unyielding struggle to abolish the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," smash the "Japan-Korea Treaty," and oppose American imperialism's containment of China. This struggle is growing stronger and the front is expanding.

Shiraishi Bann expressed firm support for the struggle of the Vietnamese people in his speech.

Shiraishi Bann also condemned the brutal atrocities of the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia and expressed outrage and grief at the persecution of outstanding Indonesian writers by the right-wing reactionary forces. He demanded an immediate halt to the mad actions of the right-wing reactionary forces and the immediate release of patriotic democrats who have been illegally arrested.

    新华社二日讯　日本代表白石凡今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上谴责了苏联分裂主义者在亚非作家运动中进行分裂破坏活动。
    白石凡说，“这次北京会议具有巩固整个亚非地区作家的友谊和团结、支援战斗中的越南人民的紧急而神圣的任务和重大的意义。然而就在会议即将召开的时候，苏联分裂主义者在开罗非法地干出破坏这次紧急会议的行径。不仅如此，它还公开地发表声明，破坏亚非作家为反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义争取民族独立、和平、民主而斗争的唯一合法组织——亚非作家会议。”白石凡说：“我们以激怒的心情谴责这种分裂行动”。
    白石凡在发言中还谴责了美帝国主义大力加紧复活日本军国主义的罪行。他说，日本人民在为废除“日美安全条约”、粉碎“日韩条约”、反对美帝国主义的“遏制”中国而进行着不屈不挠的斗争。这种斗争正在日益增强，战线日益扩大。
    白石凡在发言中表示坚决支持越南人民的斗争。
    白石凡还谴责了印度尼西亚右派反动势力的残酷暴行，对印度尼西亚优秀作家遭到右派反动势力的迫害感到愤怒和痛心。他要求立即制止右派反动势力的疯狂行动，立即释放被非法逮捕的爱国民主人士。
