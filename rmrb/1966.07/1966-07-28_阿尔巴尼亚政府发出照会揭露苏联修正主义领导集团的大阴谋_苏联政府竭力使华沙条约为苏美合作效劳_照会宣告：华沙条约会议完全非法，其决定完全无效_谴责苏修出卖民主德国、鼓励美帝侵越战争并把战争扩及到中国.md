The Albanian government has issued a note exposing the big conspiracy of the Soviet revisionist leadership group. The Soviet government is striving to make the Warsaw Pact serve Soviet-American cooperation. The note declares: The Warsaw Pact conference is completely illegal, and its decisions are completely invalid. It condemns the Soviet revisionists for betraying the German Democratic Republic, encouraging the U.S. imperialist war of aggression in Vietnam, and extending the war to China.

NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, Tirana, July 27 — At the request of the government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Albania handed a note to the diplomatic representatives of other Warsaw Pact member countries in Tirana on July 19. The note condemns the Soviet government for illegally depriving the Albanian government of its lawful right to participate in the Political Consultative Committee meeting of the Warsaw Pact held in Bucharest from July 4 to 6. It points out that this meeting was completely illegal and its decisions are completely invalid. The note also condemns the Soviet government for striving to use the Warsaw Pact as a tool to push its great-power chauvinist policy and as a means to capitulate to U.S. imperialism, increasingly making the Warsaw Pact serve the policy of Soviet-American cooperation, and betraying the interests of the peoples of socialist countries. The full text of the note is as follows:

From July 4 to 6, 1966, the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Pact held an illegal meeting in Bucharest. The People's Republic of Albania was not invited to participate in this meeting. The government of the People's Republic of Albania deems it necessary to make the following statement on this matter:

The government of the People's Republic of Albania, as the government of a sovereign state and a member of the Warsaw Pact with full equal rights, was not invited to participate in the Political Consultative Committee meeting held in Bucharest. This discriminatory act is a new arbitrary violation of the provisions and spirit of the Warsaw Pact, seriously infringing upon the lawful rights of the People's Republic of Albania as stipulated in the Warsaw Pact, and damaging the interests and prestige of the pact itself. The Political Consultative Committee meeting of the Warsaw Pact is part of the series of illegal and hostile actions that the Soviet government and other member governments have taken against the People's Republic of Albania within the Warsaw Pact in recent years.

The line followed by the organizers of this Political Consultative Committee meeting of the Warsaw Pact once again proves that the Soviet government blatantly disregards the sovereignty of the Warsaw Pact member countries, continues to blatantly trample on the principles and basic provisions of this pact, and strives to use this pact as a tool to push its great-power chauvinist policy and as a means to capitulate to U.S. imperialism.

The Soviet government is pushing the Warsaw Pact down this path, which is completely contrary to the noble purposes on which this organization was established. The principles on which the Warsaw Pact is based are not only shamelessly trampled upon but are also distorted beyond recognition and have lost their true meaning. The Soviet government is increasingly making the Warsaw Pact serve the policy of Soviet-American cooperation, betraying the interests of the peoples of socialist countries.

Under these extremely serious circumstances, the government of the People's Republic of Albania has timely exposed all the hostile and treacherous actions taken by the Soviet government, and it reminds the Warsaw Pact member countries of the dangers of this path and its extremely serious consequences for the future of the peoples of socialist countries and, in general, for the future of peace.

The government of the People's Republic of Albania publicly and resolutely condemns the Soviet government for infringing upon the sovereignty and inviolable rights of the People's Republic of Albania in the Warsaw Pact, the sole reason for which is that the People's Republic of Albania has not submitted to the anti-Marxist line and dictatorial style of the Soviet leadership and great-power chauvinism. The People's Republic of Albania has defended the noble principles of equality, mutual respect, independence, sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs recognized by the pact.

In the letter to the Political Consultative Committee meeting of the Warsaw Pact held in January 1965, the government of the People's Republic of Albania clearly and unambiguously explained its position on participating in the meetings of this pact. The events that have occurred so far prove that not only have the other countries that are members of the Warsaw Pact not taken any steps to create the necessary conditions for the People's Republic of Albania to participate in the meetings of the Warsaw Pact, but the Khrushchev-style leaders continue to take serious anti-socialist and anti-Albanian actions, which can be clearly seen in the recent meeting.

Based on the above situation, the government of the People's Republic of Albania considers that the Warsaw Pact meeting held this July is illegal, invalid, and worthless, and its decisions are completely invalid.

At the same time, the Albanian government cannot but condemn the dangerous conspiracy actions taken at this Warsaw Pact meeting as indicated in the official communiqué and the press.

According to the official news reported in the press, the Political Consultative Committee meeting of the Warsaw Pact discussed the issue of peace and security in Europe and the issue of U.S. aggression in Vietnam, and adopted relevant declarations and statements.

The "Declaration on the Consolidation of Peace and Security in Europe" and the "Statement on U.S. Aggression in Vietnam" clearly show that the Soviet government and its followers used the Bucharest meeting as a platform to intensify their deceitful propaganda, aiming to deceive the peoples of various countries and plot new conspiracies against the vital interests of socialist countries and peace.

Based on the general spirit of dividing spheres of influence and the two superpowers dominating the world in the context of Soviet-American cooperation, the "Declaration on the Consolidation of Peace and Security in Europe" clearly exposes their fundamental purpose of intensifying collusion with imperialist countries, rather than for the future of the socialist camp, or for seeking peace and security in Europe and the world on the basis of solid principles. This declaration, starting from an anti-socialist position and one that harms the vital interests of the peoples of the world, does not truly reflect the relations between European countries and the situation in the world, but falsely claims that the conditions for "taking constructive measures" to strengthen peace and security in Europe have been created, which can be achieved through "convening a pan-European conference." The declaration even expresses the hope of concluding "an agreement to abolish military organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact."

The Warsaw Pact was concluded after the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism and its European partners had caused the situation in Europe to deteriorate and international tensions to escalate. One of the main purposes of establishing the Warsaw Pact was to deal with the danger posed to socialist countries and peace by the remilitarization of West Germany and its participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military alliance, aiming to guarantee the security of socialist countries and to defend European peace from any aggression by imperialists and the North Atlantic military alliance controlled by the United States.

Various facts prove that the international situation has not eased in Europe and the world, the United States is increasingly strengthening its military power, and is constantly taking aggressive actions against the freedom and independence of the peoples of various countries. The United States stubbornly continues its vicious policy of blackmail, continues to plot conspiracies, and openly invades Vietnam and other places in the world, and is frantically preparing for a third world war.

In Europe, the United States has been and continues to pursue a policy of issuing orders and subjugating Western countries, it has unprecedentedly strengthened its military bases equipped with the most modern weapons up to thermonuclear weapons, it directly promotes the revival of the "Bundeswehr," and goes all out to equip West German troops with nuclear weapons. The U.S. fleet is roaming the seas of Europe, ready to open fire at any time. At the same time, the United States pursues a deceptive policy of "bridging" and "peaceful evolution" towards socialist countries. The "Declaration on the Consolidation of Peace and Security in Europe" adopted in Bucharest is in line with this policy and serves this policy.

The German question is one of the main links in guaranteeing European security, and this question has always been pending. It is known that not long ago, all the socialist member countries that joined the Warsaw Pact believed that the main problem to be solved as soon as possible was the unresolved problem left over from the end of the Second World War, and first of all, the German question and the Berlin question should be solved by concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanys or by concluding a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic. Considering the importance of this question to the fate of the German people and the entire European people, all the socialist member countries that joined the Warsaw Pact clearly declared at the Political Consultative Committee meeting of the Warsaw Pact held in February 1960: "Concluding a peace treaty, abandoning all thoughts of revenge and changing borders, and abandoning the policy of remilitarization and nuclear armament of Germany, this is the best way to guarantee the security of the peoples of all European countries and the peaceful future of the German people." However, the signatories of the "Declaration on the Consolidation of Peace and Security in Europe" now say that they intend to "continue to seek a solution to this question," which in fact means that they want to drag out the issue of the German peace treaty indefinitely. The declaration signed in Bucharest abandons and betrays the German Democratic Republic and the German people, thereby encouraging the expansionist and revenge policy of the Federal Republic of Germany, leading to the deterioration of the situation in Europe.

At a time when U.S. imperialism is openly invading the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and preparing to attack the People's Republic of China, to talk about the possibility of concluding agreements between some socialist countries and Western countries, including the United States, and on this basis seeking détente, security, and peace in Europe, is to collude with U.S. imperialists against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China, and to conspire with the United States against socialist brother countries. This once again proves that the Soviet government is going further and further down the road of great betrayal.

At present, the proposal to dissolve the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is only beneficial to the United States. This proposal is to create a relatively calm situation for U.S. imperialism in Europe and, on the basis of such an alleged "agreement," to allow the United States to use the troops stationed in Europe to wage the evil war against heroic Vietnam, to concentrate its forces in Asia against the People's Republic of China, and against other Southeast Asian countries, and against the peoples of various countries who are fighting for freedom, national independence, social progress, and peace.

Even before the basic issues are resolved, to demand the abolition of the Warsaw Pact through the conclusion of corresponding "agreements" with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries is to betray the principles on which the Warsaw Pact was established, to blatantly trample on the clear provisions of the pact. Such a proposal is completely contrary to Article 7 of the pact, which clearly stipulates that the contracting parties undertake "not to conclude any agreement contrary to the purpose of this pact."

The statement on U.S. aggression in Vietnam, using deceptive methods, claims that member countries supposedly "support" the struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggressors, "most resolutely" warn the U.S. government against aggression against the Vietnamese people, express their intention to send volunteers to Vietnam to provide "increasingly strong moral and political support and multi-faceted assistance" to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, call for joint action by socialist countries, and so on.

Everyone can clearly see that the hypocritical statements of the Khrushchev revisionists are one thing, and their actual actions are another. The facts have proven that the Soviet revisionist leaders collude and conspire with U.S. imperialists against the heroic Vietnamese people, proving that they do not care about the victory of the Vietnamese people, they strive to support the U.S. imperialist war of aggression and global strategy, and they join forces with the United States through open or secret agreements to try to save the failure of the United States, because the failure of the United States is generally a disaster for the revisionists themselves.

The deceptive methods of the Soviet revisionist leaders in the issue of U.S. aggression in Vietnam have also been clearly exposed in recent events: the ink on the statement signed in Bucharest on the Vietnam issue has not yet dried, and the Soviet revisionist leaders have made new deals with the agents of U.S. imperialism to harm the heroic Vietnamese people.

The Party of Labor of Albania and the government of the People's Republic of Albania have not once clearly pointed out that the so-called "support" of the Khrushchev revisionists for the struggle of the Vietnamese people is mere boasting, and their "assistance" is insignificant and worthless in the face of the heroic spirit and sacrifice of the Vietnamese people. In the letter to the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party dated February 11, 1966, the Party of Labor of Albania clearly exposed the hypocrisy of the Khrushchev revisionists' call for "joint action," and the Party of Labor of Albania explicitly said that the Khrushchev revisionists intend to use the slogan of "joint action" to make all socialist countries complicit in this crime, because it is now clear that the Khrushchev revisionists do not intend to help Vietnam but to sabotage its struggle, to cover up their new crimes, which is the new crime of encouraging and supporting the imperialists to prepare to attack the People's Republic of China, which resolutely resists U.S. imperialism and actively and unreservedly aids the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people. In addition, the statement on U.S. aggression in Vietnam signed in Bucharest also exposes another conspiracy of the Khrushchev revisionists. This statement mentions the danger caused to Cambodia and Laos and other countries by U.S. aggression in Vietnam, but it deliberately conceals the fact that the ultimate goal of U.S. aggression in Vietnam is to launch an aggression against the People's Republic of China, which is now clear to the whole world. At a time when the United States is intensifying provocations and taking hostile actions against the People's Republic of China, the Bucharest statement remains silent on this issue, which in fact means that the United States can use all its strength to achieve its evil purposes against China. This further exposes the treacherous actions of the current Soviet government and its role as a conspirator in the U.S. imperialist plan to establish a "ring of fire" and prepare for open aggression against the People's Republic of China.

The decisions announced at the Political Consultative Committee meeting of the Warsaw Pact held in Bucharest are nothing but a concession to U.S. imperialism in Europe, so that U.S. imperialism can expand the war in Vietnam and extend the war to the People's Republic of China.

In addition, the Party of Labor of Albania said in its letter of February 11, 1966, "In the Vietnamese incident, the only principled and feasible position for truly Marxist-Leninist parties and socialist countries is: to actively, fully, and unreservedly support the brotherly Vietnamese people, and to wage an unyielding and uncompromising struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, including severing all relations with U.S. imperialist aggressors." The Soviet revisionist traitors and their followers have not done this and will never do this.

Therefore, the Political Consultative Committee meeting of the Warsaw Pact held in Bucharest is a big conspiracy that not only does not benefit the cause of peace, European security, and the victory of the brotherly Vietnamese people, but clearly shows that the current Soviet leadership and its supporters are prepared to sacrifice the fundamental interests of the German Democratic Republic, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries, the fruits of socialism, and the very existence of the socialist camp to the altar of the Soviet-American alliance. This conspiracy incites West German militarism to pursue expansionist and revenge policies, serves the policy of U.S. imperialist aggression in Asia and other parts of the world, and will ultimately lead to the destruction of peace and security in Europe and the world.

The government of the People's Republic of Albania deems it necessary to point out that the People's Republic of Albania has always firmly advocated the guarantee of collective security in Europe, while firmly believing that the guarantee of European security and the maintenance of European peace cannot be separated from the guarantee of international security and the maintenance of world peace. The agreement on European collective security proposed in the Bucharest Declaration, which is based on the betrayal of the solidarity and fundamental interests of the member countries of the socialist camp and the betrayal of the freedom of the peoples of various countries and world peace, is a real crime against the peoples of the socialist camp countries, the peoples of European countries, communism, and peace.

Therefore, the government of the People's Republic of Albania, which firmly advocates a true peace policy and resolutely fights against world imperialism led by U.S. imperialism, and which regards the fate of its own people, the peoples of socialist countries, and the brotherly peoples of other peace-loving countries as paramount, resolutely condemns this new conspiracy plotted at the Bucharest meeting. The governments of the participating countries, especially the Soviet government, bear serious responsibility for this, and the government of the People's Republic of Albania believes that these governments will one day have to account to their peoples, to the peoples of the socialist camp countries, and to the peoples of the world for the enormous damage they have caused to the cause of socialism and world peace.

    阿尔巴尼亚政府发出照会揭露苏联修正主义领导集团的大阴谋
    苏联政府竭力使华沙条约为苏美合作效劳
    照会宣告：华沙条约会议完全非法，其决定完全无效
    谴责苏修出卖民主德国、鼓励美帝侵越战争并把战争扩及到中国
    新华社地拉那二十七日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国外交部受政府的委托，在七月十九日把一项照会交给华沙条约其它成员国驻地拉那的外交代表。照会谴责苏联政府非法剥夺阿尔巴尼亚政府参加七月四日到六日在布加勒斯特举行的华沙条约政治协商委员会会议的合法权利，指出这次会议是完全非法的，它的决定是完全无效的。照会还谴责苏联政府竭力把华沙条约作为推行它的大国沙文主义政策的工具和投降美帝国主义的手段，日益促使华沙条约为苏美合作政策效劳，出卖社会主义各国人民的利益。照会全文如下：
    华沙条约政治协商委员会从一九六六年七月四日到六日，在布加勒斯特举行了一次非法的会议，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国没有被邀请参加这次会议。对此，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府认为有必要作如下的申述：
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府作为一个主权国家的政府和享有完全和平等权利的华沙条约（组织）的成员，没有被邀请参加在布加勒斯特举行的政治协商委员会会议。这一歧视行为，是对华沙条约的条款和精神的新的专横的破坏，严重地侵犯了阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国根据华沙条约所享有的合法权利，并且损害了条约本身的利益和威望。华沙条约政治协商委员会的这次会议本身，就是最近这几年以来，苏联政府和其它成员国政府在华沙条约（组织）内部对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国接连采取的非法和敌对行为的组成部分。
    华沙条约政治协商委员会的这次会议的组织者所遵循的路线再一次证明，苏联政府粗暴地无视华沙条约成员国的主权，继续明目张胆地践踏这一条约的各项原则和基本条款，竭力把这一条约作为推行它的大国沙文主义政策的工具和投降美帝国主义的手段。
    苏联政府把华沙条约推上这样一条道路，根本不符合这个组织赖以建立的崇高宗旨。华沙条约所依据的原则不仅遭到无耻的践踏，而且被篡改得面目全非而丧失了真正的意义。苏联政府日益促使华沙条约为苏美合作政策效劳，出卖社会主义各国人民的利益。
    在这种十分严重的情况下，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府及时地揭露了苏联政府连续采取的一切敌对的阴险的行动，它提醒华沙条约成员国注意这条道路的危险性及其对社会主义各国人民的前途，以及总的说来对和平的前途的十分严重的后果。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府公开和坚决地谴责苏联政府侵犯阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国在华沙条约（组织）中享有的主权和不可侵犯的权利，苏联政府这样作的唯一原因就是因为，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国没有向苏联领导的反马克思主义路线和大国沙文主义的独裁作风屈服，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国保卫了条约所确认的平等、相互尊重、独立、主权和互不干涉内政的崇高原则。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府在一九六五年一月十五日写给于同年一月举行的华沙条约政治协商委员会会议的信中明确地、毫不含糊地阐明了它对于参加这个条约的会议所采取的立场。到目前为止所发生的事件证明，不仅参加华沙条约的其他国家没有采取任何步骤为阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国参加华沙条约的会议创造必需的条件，而且，赫鲁晓夫式的领导人继续采取反社会主义和反阿尔巴尼亚的严重行动，这一点在最近这次会上也可以清楚地看出来。
    根据上述情况，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府认为，今年七月举行的这次华沙条约会议是违反规定的、非法的、一文不值的，它的决定是完全无效的。
    同时，阿尔巴尼亚政府不能不谴责正式公报和报刊所表明的、在这次华沙条约会议上所采取的危险的阴谋行动。
    据报刊报道的正式消息，在这次华沙条约政治协商委员会会议上，讨论了关于欧洲和平与安全的问题以及美国侵略越南的问题，并且通过了有关的宣言和声明。
    “关于巩固欧洲和平与安全”的宣言以及“关于美国侵略越南”的声明，都清楚地表明，苏联政府及其追随者利用布加勒斯特会议作为讲坛，加紧进行蛊惑人心的宣传，目的是要欺骗各国人民和策划新的阴谋，反对社会主义国家的切身利益，反对和平。
    在苏美合作划分势力范围和两大国主宰世界这一总的精神的基础上搞出来的“关于巩固欧洲和平与安全”的宣言，清楚地暴露了它们的根本目的是加紧同帝国主义国家的勾结，而决不是为了社会主义阵营的前途，决不是为了在牢固的原则的基础上谋求欧洲和世界的和平与安全。这一宣言由于从反社会主义的和损害世界各国人民切身利益的立场出发，并不真正反映欧洲国家之间的关系和世界的形势，却硬说什么已经具备了“采取建设性的措施”以加强欧洲的和平与安全的条件，而这可以通过“召开一次全欧洲的会议”来实现。宣言甚至表示希望缔结“一项取消北大西洋公约（组织）和华沙条约（组织）那样的军事机构的协议”。
    华沙条约是在美帝国主义及其欧洲伙伴的侵略政策造成了欧洲局势恶化和国际紧张局势加剧之后缔结的。建立华沙条约（组织）的主要目的之一，是对付重新军国主义化并且参加了北大西洋公约组织军事集团的西德对社会主义国家和和平造成的危险，其目的是为了保障社会主义国家的安全，以及保卫欧洲的和平，使之免受帝国主义者以及为美国所控制的北大西洋军事集团的任何侵略。
    种种事实证明，在欧洲和全世界，国际紧张局势并没有缓和，美国在日益加强它的军事力量，并且不断地采取侵略行动反对各国人民的自由和独立。美国顽固地继续奉行凶恶的讹诈政策，继续策划阴谋，对越南及世界其他地方的各国进行公开的侵略，并且在拚命准备第三次世界大战。
    在欧洲，美国过去和现在一直在对西方国家奉行发号施令和使它们屈服的政策，它空前地加强了它用最现代化的武器直到热核武器装备起来的军事基地，它直接助长了“德国国防军”的复活，千方百计地使西德军队配备核武器，美国舰队在欧洲的海面到处游弋，随时准备开火。同时，美国对社会主义国家奉行“搭桥”和“和平演变”的欺骗性的政策。“关于巩固欧洲和平与安全”的布加勒斯特宣言，正是符合这种政策并且为这种政策效劳的。
    德国问题是保障欧洲安全的主要环节之一，这一问题始终有待解决。大家知道，不久以前参加华沙条约的所有社会主义成员国都认为，必须尽快解决的主要问题是第二次世界大战之后遗留下来的悬而未决的问题，而首先就是通过同两个德国缔结和约，或者是单独同德意志民主共和国缔结和约来解决德国问题和西柏林问题。考虑到这一问题对德国人民以及整个欧洲人民的命运是如此重要，参加华沙条约的所有社会主义成员国在一九六○年二月举行的华沙条约政治协商委员会会议上明确地宣告：“缔结和约，放弃复仇和修改疆界的一切念头，放弃德国重新军国主义化和原子武装的政策，这就是保证欧洲所有国家人民的安全和德国人民和平未来的最好道路。”但是，“关于巩固欧洲和平与安全”的宣言的签字国现在却说它们打算“继续寻求这一问题的解决办法”，事实上这就是说，它们要把对德和约问题无休止地拖下去。在布加勒斯特签署的宣言，抛弃和出卖了德意志民主共和国和德国人民，从而怂恿了德意志联邦共和国的扩张政策，导致欧洲局势的恶化。
    正当美帝国主义在亚洲公开侵略越南民主共和国这样一个社会主义兄弟国家，并且准备进攻中华人民共和国的时候，谈论什么在某些社会主义国家和包括美国在内的西方国家之间可以缔结协定，并在这个基础上谋求欧洲的缓和、安全与和平，这就是同美帝国主义者狼狈为奸反对越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国，也就是同美国同谋反对社会主义兄弟国家。这就再次证明，苏联政府在大出卖的道路上越走越远。
    当前，解散华沙条约组织和北大西洋公约组织的建议，只对美国有利，这个建议是为了在欧洲为美帝国主义创造一种相对平静的局面，并且在这样一个所谓“协定”的基础上，让美国放手使用驻在欧洲的军队进行反对英雄的越南的罪恶战争，让美国集中力量在亚洲反对中华人民共和国，其他东南亚国家，以及正在为自由、民族独立、社会进步与和平而斗争的各国人民。
    甚至在基本问题得到解决之前，就要求通过同北大西洋公约组织国家缔结相应的“协定”，来取消华沙条约（组织），这种行为就是背叛华沙条约（组织）据以建立的原则，公开地悍然践踏条约的明确条款。这样的建议是同条约第七条完全相违背的，这一条文明确规定，缔约国各方保证“不缔结和本条约的目的相违反的任何协定”。
    关于美国侵略越南的声明以蛊惑人心的手法声称成员国对于越南人民抗击美国侵略者的斗争的所谓“支持”，“最坚决地”警告美国政府对越南人民的侵略，表示它们“打算”派遣志愿人员去越南，以便向越南民主共和国提供“越来越有力的道义和政治支持和多方面的援助”，呼吁社会主义国家采取“联合行动”等等。
    大家看得很清楚，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的如此伪善的说法是一回事，而他们的实际行动则又是一回事。事实已经证明，苏联修正主义领导人同美帝国主义者勾结和合谋来反对越南兄弟人民，证明他们关心的不是越南人民的胜利，他们竭力支持美帝国主义的侵略战争和全球战略，他们同美国通过公开的或秘密的协议联合起来，千方百计地力图挽救美国的失败，因为美国的失败总的来说也是修正主义者本身的灾难。
    苏联修正主义领导人在美帝国主义侵略越南的问题上采取的蛊惑人心的手法在最近的事件中也明显地暴露出来：在布加勒斯特就越南问题签署的声明墨迹未干，苏联修正主义领导人就同美帝国主义派出的代理人搞新的交易，来损害英雄的越南人民。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府已经不止一次地清楚地指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者所谈的对越南人民的斗争的“支持”只是吹牛，他们的“援助”是微不足道的，事实上在越南人民的英雄气概和牺牲面前是一文不值的。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在一九六六年二月十一日致波兰统一工人党中央委员会的信中明确地揭露了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者关于“联合行动”的呼吁的虚伪性，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党明白地说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者打算利用“联合行动”的口号使所有的社会主义国家在这一罪行中充当同谋犯，因为现在很明显，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者并不打算帮助越南，而是要破坏它的斗争，掩饰他们的新的罪行的罪迹，这一新罪行就是鼓励和支持帝国主义者准备对坚决抗击美帝国主义和无保留地、积极地援助越南人民英雄斗争的中华人民共和国发动的进攻。此外，在布加勒斯特签署的关于美国侵略越南的声明也暴露出赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的另一阴谋，这一声明提到由于美国侵略越南也对柬埔寨及老挝等国家所造成的危险，但是却别有用心地掩盖了这一事实，即美国侵略越南的最终目的是要对中华人民共和国发动侵略，现在全世界都清楚地看出这一点。正当美国对人民中国加紧进行挑衅和采取敌对行动的时候，布加勒斯特声明却对这一问题保持沉默，事实上这意味着，对中国，美国可以使用它的全部力量来实现它的罪恶目的。这就更加明显地暴露了苏联现政府的背叛行动以及它是美帝国主义对中华人民共和国建立“火力包围圈”计划和准备公开侵略的同谋者。
    已经宣布的在布加勒斯特举行的华沙条约政治协商委员会会议的决定无非是在欧洲向美帝国主义表示妥协，以便美帝国主义在越南扩大战争并把战争扩及中华人民共和国。
    此外，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在它一九六六年二月十一日的信中说，“在越南事件中，真正的马克思列宁主义的政党和社会主义国家唯一的原则的和可行的立场是：积极地、全面地和毫无保留地支持兄弟的越南人民，以及同美帝国主义侵略者进行针锋相对的，毫不妥协的斗争，其中包括同美帝国主义侵略者断绝一切关系。”苏联修正主义叛徒及其追随者并没有这样做，他们永远不会这样做。
    因此，在布加勒斯特举行的华沙条约政治协商委员会会议是一个大阴谋，它不仅不利于和平、欧洲安全的事业和兄弟的越南人民的胜利，相反，它明确地表明，苏联现领导及其支持者准备把德意志民主共和国、越南民主共和国、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的根本利益、社会主义果实和社会主义阵营的存在本身奉献给苏美联盟的祭坛。这个阴谋鼓动了西德军国主义推行扩张和复仇政策，为美帝国主义在亚洲和世界其他地区的侵略政策效劳，并终将把欧洲和世界和平和安全引向毁灭。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府认为有必要指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国一贯坚决主张保障欧洲的集体安全，同时坚决认为，保障欧洲的安全和维护欧洲和平不能同保障国际安全和维护世界和平分开，而象布加勒斯特宣言中建议的那种建立在背叛社会主义阵营成员国的团结和根本利益、背叛各国人民的自由和世界和平的基础上的关于欧洲集体安全的协定，是对社会主义阵营各国人民、欧洲各国人民、共产主义与和平犯下名副其实的罪行。
    因此，奉行真正的和平政策和对以美帝国主义为首的世界帝国主义进行坚决斗争，并以本国人民、社会主义国家和其它爱好和平国家的兄弟人民命运为重的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，坚决谴责布加勒斯特会议上策划的这一新阴谋，与会国的政府，首先是苏联政府，对此负有严重责任，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府相信，这些国家的政府总有一天要向他们的人民、向社会主义阵营的各国人民和全世界人民，就它们给社会主义和世界和平事业造成的巨大损害作出交代。
