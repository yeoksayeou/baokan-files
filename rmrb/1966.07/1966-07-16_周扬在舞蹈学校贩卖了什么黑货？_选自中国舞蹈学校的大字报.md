Chairman Mao teaches us: “Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and are for their use.”

Zhou Yang, however, says: “Our art is not the art of a few; it is the art of the whole people. Our culture is the culture of the whole people.”

This is a blatant distortion of the proletarian direction of art, a brazen challenge to Chairman Mao’s artistic thought.

Zhou Yang’s disciples fervently promote Zhou Yang’s “art for the whole people” theory, transplanting it wholesale into the dance school. Over the past twelve years, they have turned the dance school into a “Swan Lake” school, a “young master and miss” school. Under the banner of “dance is for everyone to appreciate” and the pretext of “adhering to the laws of dance,” our school has opened the green light for all kinds of poisonous weeds of feudalism, bourgeoisie, and revisionism. Over the past twelve years, our school has produced and performed many bad programs, such as “Swan Lake,” “The Little Mermaid,” and “Spring River and Flower Moon Night,” which are representative works that Zhou Yang and his gang have falsely claimed to be “indirectly serving politics.”

Zhou Yang’s “art for the whole people” is thus, with its most distinct reactionary class nature, challenging proletarian art and serving the restoration of capitalism.

During the period when our country’s economy faced temporary difficulties, the anti-party and anti-socialist activities of Zhou Yang and his gang reached their peak. Under their command, the arts world was swept by a wave of revisionism and bourgeois “freedom.” Ghosts and monsters emerged in droves.

It was precisely during these three years that our school was turned into a chaotic mess by Zhou Yang and his gang. They proposed the slogan of “stabilizing the curriculum” and attempted to solidify the entire set of bourgeois goods in writing and spread them nationwide to poison the people. They suppressed revolutionary modern dance dramas like “Liu Huilan” and “Huang Jiguang”; they propagated bourgeois humanism and the reactionary idea of “love above all”; they even planned to shoot the even more absurd dance drama “The White Snake” and perform the reactionary ghost play “Li Huiniang.” They were so arrogant and reckless that their anti-party and anti-socialist behavior reached its height!

Zhou Yang, under the guise of “learning from and inheriting” foreign culture, actually promoted the worship of foreign and ancient cultures. He took advantage of the serious “foreign as ancestor” mentality prevalent among music and dance workers at the time, saying: “We have not absorbed enough from foreign countries; as long as we do not ‘blindly copy,’ it is fine.” Facing a stage dominated by “dead people,” Zhou Yang said: “Every new thing comes from the old; we should give feudal culture a certain historical position.” Under Zhou Yang’s “big red umbrella,” his disciples followed suit, shouting to summarize the ten-year experience of basic training in Chinese classical dance, advocating the study of the styles of feudal emperors, kings, and scholars and beauties, and promoting what they called the “Dunhuang School,” the “Law School,” and so on. But they did not represent the struggles of today’s workers, peasants, and soldiers.

At the 1963 arts education conference, Zhou Yang said: “Breaking is clearing the way and the base, but it cannot clear everything into a desolate wasteland; it cannot just break without establishing.” This is Zhou Yang’s black talk!

Chairman Mao teaches us: The elimination of all old things and the growth of new things are first broken and then established, with breaking as the priority and establishment in the process. But Zhou Yang says “it cannot clear everything into a desolate wasteland,” “it cannot just break without establishing.” His purpose is to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, to oppose the smashing of bourgeois ideology, to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to oppose our struggle against these big black gangs. In other words, this set of capitalist, revisionist, and feudalist mixed curriculum in our school should not be broken, should not be overthrown, but should be stabilized, maintained, and continued to be used to cultivate bourgeois successors. Under this revisionist arts line, we will gradually “peacefully transition” and serve the restoration of capitalism.

　　周扬在舞蹈学校贩卖了什么黑货？
　　——选自中国舞蹈学校的大字报
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”
    周扬却说：“我们的文艺不是少数人的文艺，是全民的文艺，我们的文化是全民的文化。”
    这是公然篡改文艺的工农兵方向，明目张胆地同毛主席的文艺思想唱反调。
    周扬的门徒狂热地宣扬周扬的“全民文艺”论，把它全盘地搬到了舞蹈学校。十二年来，把舞蹈学校办成了“天鹅王子”学校、“少爷小姐”学校。在“舞蹈是为一切人欣赏”的口号下，在所谓“遵守舞蹈规律”的幌子下，我校为所有封建主义的、资产阶级的、修正主义的大毒草开绿灯。十二年来，我校演出和创作了很多坏节目，如《天鹅湖》《鱼美人》《春江花月夜》等，这是被周扬一伙胡说成“间接为政治服务”的代表作。
    周扬的“全民文艺”，就是这样以其最鲜明的反动阶级性，来向无产阶级文艺进行挑战和为资本主义复辟服务的。
    在我国经济遭受暂时困难时期，周扬一伙的反党反社会主义的活动达到了顶峰。在他们的指挥下，文艺界掀起了一股修正主义、资产阶级“自由化”的妖风，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼。
    恰恰在这三年里，我校被周扬一伙搞得乌烟瘴气。他们提出了“稳定教材”的口号，企图把整套资产阶级货色用文字稳定下来，在全国推广和放毒。他们扼杀了《刘胡兰》、《黄继光》等革命现代舞剧；他们宣扬资产阶级“人道主义”、“爱情至上”等反动思想；甚至还准备拍摄更加荒唐的舞剧《白娘子》和排演反动的鬼戏《李慧娘》。他们得意忘形，反党反社会主义猖狂到了极点！
    周扬借“借鉴、继承”之名，行崇洋复古之实。他利用当时音乐舞蹈工作者中严重存在的“以洋为祖”的思想，说：“我们对外国的吸收还很不够，对外国遗产只要不是‘硬搬’就行。”面对“死人”统治着的舞台，周扬说：“哪个新事物都是从旧事物中产生的，应当给封建文化一定的历史地位。”在周扬这一“大红伞”下，他的门徒跟着叫嚷要总结中国古典舞基本训练的十年经验，叫喊要大学封建帝王将相、才子佳人的流派，大搞什么“敦煌派”、“规律派”等等，但是唯独不表现今天工农兵的斗争生活。
    周扬在一九六三年的文艺教育会议上说：“破是扫清道路，扫清基地，但是不能扫成一片荒凉，不能光破不立。”这是周扬的黑话！
    毛主席教导我们：一切旧事物的消灭，新事物的生长，都是先破后立，破字当头，立在其中。而周扬却说“不能扫成一片荒凉”，“不能光破不立”，其目的就是要反对毛泽东思想，反对大破资产阶级思想，反对无产阶级专政，反对我们斗倒他们这些大黑帮。这也就是说，我校的这套资本主义、修正主义和封建主义大杂烩的教材不要破它，不要革它的命，而要稳定它，维护它，继续用这套反动教材来培养资产阶级接班人，使我们在这条修正主义文艺路线下逐渐地“和平过渡”，为资本主义复辟效劳。
