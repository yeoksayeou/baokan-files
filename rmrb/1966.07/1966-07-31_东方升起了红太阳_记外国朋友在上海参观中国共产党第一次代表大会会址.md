Forty-five years ago, on July 1st, when China was in the depths of darkness, a thunderous roar echoed from the East, and the great Chinese Communist Party was born. Chairman Mao said, "The birth of the Communist Party in China is a great event that has changed the course of history."

In Shanghai, on an ordinary street named Xingye Road, there stands an ordinary stone-gate house. This is the site of the first National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, where the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party was born. Forty-five years ago, representatives from various regions, including Comrade Mao Zedong and eleven others, were elected by communist groups across the country. They represented the fifty-seven party members nationwide and convened the first National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party here. From that day forward, the Chinese revolution underwent a fundamental change, and the face of the Chinese revolution was transformed.

Over the past forty-five years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which was personally founded by Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have overcome countless hardships and storms. Guided by the brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong, they have defeated powerful class enemies both domestically and internationally, overthrown the three mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism that had oppressed the Chinese people, and are now leading the Chinese people in a victorious socialist revolution and socialist construction. Since the birth of the Chinese Communist Party, it has been like a radiant red sun, illuminating all of China and the world. Since July 1952, over one hundred countries and regions have sent more than ten thousand foreign friends to visit the site of the first National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. Many of them came here with strong revolutionary fervor to study the thoughts of Mao Zedong and draw inspiration from the experiences of the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese revolution. The glorious journey of the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese people in their heroic struggle and victory has greatly inspired their revolutionary resolve and strengthened their confidence in achieving revolutionary victory.

A Sacred Place of Revolution Yearned for by the World's People

Many foreign friends visiting Shanghai have referred to the site of the first National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party as a "sacred place of revolution" and consider the day of their visit as "the happiest day of their life" and "the most revolutionary moment of their life."

Foreign friends yearn so much for the birthplace of the Chinese Communist Party because it is a place to learn the thoughts of Mao Zedong and draw revolutionary strength. Some friends from Asia said that visiting this place of great historical significance is a matter of great importance. It is not only because the first National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party was held here, but also because the spark that was ignited here has become a blazing revolutionary fire all over the world. A friend from Bolivia said that he came all the way from distant Latin America to Shanghai with sincere intentions to visit this place, because this place is not only of great significance to China but also of great significance to the world communist movement. A friend from an Indonesian trade union delegation said: This place is like a torch illuminating the next generation of revolutionaries. A friend from the Guinean trade union delegation said: Our visit to the birthplace of the Chinese Communist Party is to regard this memorial hall as a hall of truth. It is not only a memorial hall for the Chinese people but also for the Guinean people and all the people of the world.

Foreign friends who came to visit here all enthusiastically praised the great historical significance of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party. Some said, "The victory of the October Revolution in Russia shook the world, and the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party shook the world again." Others said, "The founding of the Chinese Communist Party is the most significant event in the history of the Chinese people and the international communist and workers' movements." Still, others said, "The establishment of the Chinese Communist Party is a great milestone in the development of world revolutionary forces." They thought of the history of the Chinese Communist Party's daring to struggle and daring to win, and praised the Chinese Communist Party as a great, glorious, and correct party, a true Marxist-Leninist revolutionary party.

Through the visit, more and more foreign friends came to understand deeply: The Chinese Communist Party has the great and invincible thought of Mao Zedong as the ideological foundation for the unity and revolution of the entire party, and the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao. The Chinese Communist Party was established according to Chairman Mao's thoughts on party building and revolutionary style, and is a proletarian revolutionary party that combines theory with practice, is closely linked with the masses, and has the spirit of self-criticism. Chairman Mao has always stood at the forefront of the revolutionary storm in various historical periods of the Chinese Communist Party. Facing the extremely complex situation of the Chinese revolution, Chairman Mao correctly proposed and solved a series of theoretical and strategic issues. The reason why the Chinese revolution could avoid one reef after another, capture one position after another, and move from victory to greater victory is fundamentally because there was Chairman Mao and the invincible thought of Mao Zedong.

Foreign friends have unlimited love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao. When they heard that Chairman Mao participated in the first National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in this small room, they could not suppress their excitement. They asked eagerly: Did Chairman Mao sit on this chair? Many foreign friends paid great attention to the early revolutionary publications and manuscripts of Chairman Mao on display here. They looked at them carefully, one after another, and some even made detailed notes. In their messages, they enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao. A friend from Thailand wrote a poem praising Chairman Mao:

	The power of the people is the greatest power,
	The human factor is first, not weapons,
	This is the teaching of our beloved teacher,
	This is an undeniable truth!

During the visit, such touching scenes often occurred: When foreign friends saw that the first photo in the souvenir pictures given to them by the staff was a photo of Chairman Mao taken in 1925, they were overjoyed, holding Chairman Mao's photo with both hands, and some even held the photo high, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" They said, "This is the most precious gift," "I am the happiest to have this photo." Some foreign friends sang enthusiastically with their Chinese friends who received them, singing songs like "The East Is Red," "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and "Unity Is Strength." The more they sang, the louder their voices became, and the more excited they felt. Many people sang with tears of excitement and joy in their eyes, spontaneously shouting, "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!"

"The Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" Is an Irrefutable Truth

Many foreign friends have visited the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an and the revolutionary cradle of Jinggangshan and have a deep impression of the heroic struggle of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the people to victory in the course of the Chinese revolution. Now they come here, in the exhibition room attached to the site of the first National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, and see the eight golden words "The Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" copied from Chairman Mao's handwriting, they feel particularly familiar. They know that this is a great saying proposed by Chairman Mao more than thirty years ago when the Chinese revolution was in a very difficult period. Now, this prophecy has already become a reality. The revolutionary storm has swept across the vast lands of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Foreign friends, during their visit, recall Chairman Mao's words. They call the words "The Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" an "irrefutable truth" and the "source of revolutionary power." Some foreign friends even shouted, "Long live the spark that can start a prairie fire!" A friend from Laos said that the birth of the Chinese Communist Party and its experience fully prove: The power of revolution, although weak at the beginning, can, once it thoroughly understands and masters the theory of proletarian revolution, lead and unite the people to fight thoroughly against national enemies and enemies of the proletariat, believe in their own strength, rely on their own strength, and then they will definitely win. This experience is of great value to the Laotian people who have risen and are rising to fight for their country's independence and to the people of the world. An Argentine journalist said: This place is the best proof for all Marxist-Leninists in the world, proving that as long as there is a correct revolutionary line that combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific realities of one's own country, the spark can definitely start a prairie fire.

The great truth of "The Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" has particularly inspired many foreign friends who have long been on the front lines of revolutionary armed struggle, further strengthening their resolve to dare to struggle and their confidence to dare to win. A friend from the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam said: If the Chinese revolution started from a spark and achieved today's victory in a harsh struggle environment, then our South Vietnamese people will definitely achieve brilliant victories. A friend from Angola said: Chairman Mao's words are correct. The development of the revolution is from small to large. As long as revolutionaries have the correct line and revolutionary determination, the revolutionary cause can continue to develop and grow. Although the revolutionary struggle in Angola has encountered many difficulties, we will definitely overcome them! A friend from Congo (Kinshasa) said: The spark has already been ignited on the Congolese plain. Although we still have to pay a great price, even our lives, the Congolese people will eventually defeat the seemingly powerful imperialism and achieve the final victory of the revolution.

Learn from Mao Zedong Thought and Carry the Revolution Through to the End

Many revolutionary friends from the five continents, after visiting the site of the first National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, deeply realized that the victory of the Chinese revolution was achieved through the invincible thought of Mao Zedong. They all expressed their determination to read Chairman Mao's books diligently, further learn from Mao Zedong Thought, and draw revolutionary strength from Mao Zedong Thought.

A Japanese friend said: Today, the Japanese people's affection for Mao Zedong Thought is deeper and deeper. Mao Zedong Thought has a greater and greater influence on the Japanese people who have long been engaged in the struggle against American imperialism. This is the decisive force promoting the continuous revolution of the Japanese people.

A friend from Ceylon said: Mao Zedong Thought is very important to the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Mao Zedong Thought guides the oppressed people of the world forward. Without Mao Zedong Thought, it would be impossible to wage a struggle for national liberation; without Mao Zedong Thought, it would be impossible to wage a world revolution.

Many young friends from Asia, Africa, and Latin America said that in their countries, study groups for Chairman Mao's works are becoming more and more numerous, and Chairman Mao's works are the books they love to read the most and the best guides for revolutionary work. They were deeply impressed by seeing in China that after the workers and peasants actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, they generated boundless strength. After visiting the site of the first National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, their desire to learn from Mao Zedong Thought was further aroused.

A friend from Guinea, who brought Chairman Mao's works with him to visit China, said: "I love to read Chairman Mao's works. During my visit to China, I read them even on the plane. I have read 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' several times, but I will read it over and over again. Because Mao Zedong Thought is the driving force for the revolution, we cannot be separated from Mao Zedong Thought for a moment."

Every time foreign friends finished their visit, they would shake hands firmly with their Chinese friends who received them, take photos together, and leave messages. Many people expressed in their messages their belief that with Mao Zedong Thought and China as an example, they would fear no enemies and no difficulties would stop them from advancing victoriously on the road of revolution. A friend from an African trade union delegation said: In 1917, the Soviet Union established the first socialist state, but now the Soviet Communist Party leadership has become modern revisionists. It is precisely because the Chinese Communist Party has risen to oppose modern revisionism and defend Marxism-Leninism that we have not followed the Soviet modern revisionists astray and lost our way.

A Japanese friend said: It is not easy to carry the revolution through to the end. With the Chinese Communist Party, which is guided by Mao Zedong Thought and has consistently fought against imperialism and revisionism, as a shining example, we are determined to make the flames of the Japanese people's revolution burn even brighter until the whole world is liberated.

A friend from Chile said: We have a powerful weapon in our hands—Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Although our revolutionary forces are still weak at present, as Chairman Mao said, progressive forces always grow from small to large, and we will definitely become strong.

Revolutionary youths from Italy and Austria said that the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong is the pathfinder of the world revolution. Through this visit, we have gained new strength and increased our revolutionary confidence. Although our revolutionary forces are still small, we believe they will definitely grow stronger. We must contribute to the defense of Marxism-Leninism and the opposition to modern revisionism, and to the struggle for the liberation of our country and all humanity.

Many foreign friends described the visit as a "shock to the soul," "a once-in-a-lifetime experience," and "an event to be forever remembered." They said that in the future, no matter how many difficulties they encounter on the road of revolution, as long as they think of this small house in Shanghai with world significance, they will be full of confidence and forge ahead bravely.

    东方升起了红太阳
    ——记外国朋友在上海参观中国共产党第一次代表大会会址
    四十五年前的七月一日，当中国正处在深沉的黑夜的时候，一声春雷从东方响起，伟大的中国共产党诞生了。毛主席说：“中国产生了共产党，这是开天辟地的大事变。”
    在上海一条普通的马路——兴业路上，有幢沿街的普通石库门房子，这就是中国共产党第一次代表大会会址，就是伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党诞生的地方。四十五年前，各地共产主义小组选举了毛泽东同志等十二位代表，代表当时全国的五十七个党员，在这里举行了中国共产党第一次代表大会。从此开始，中国革命起了根本的变化，中国革命的面貌就焕然一新。
    四十五年来，毛主席亲手缔造的中国共产党领导全国人民，经过千难万苦，大风大浪，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，战胜了国内外强大的阶级敌人，推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，并且正在领导全国人民胜利地进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设。中国共产党，从她诞生的那一天起，就象一轮光芒四射的红太阳，照耀着全中国，照耀着全世界。从一九五二年七月以来，已有一百多个国家和地区的一万多名外国朋友，前来中国共产党第一次代表大会会址参观。许多人怀着强烈的革命激情到这里来学习毛泽东思想，来汲取中国共产党领导中国革命的经验。中国共产党领导中国人民英勇斗争、夺取胜利的光辉历程，大大地鼓舞了他们革命的决心，增强了他们取得革命胜利的信心。
    世界人民无限向往的革命圣地
    来到上海访问的许多外国朋友，把中国共产党第一次代表大会会址称为“崇高的革命圣地”；把前来参观的这一天看作是“一生中最幸福的日子”，“生平最富有革命意义的时刻”。
    外国朋友如此向往中国共产党的诞生地，是因为这里是学习毛泽东思想，汲取革命力量的好地方。亚洲的一些朋友说，参观这个富有历史意义的地方是一件极为重大的事，这不仅因为中国共产党第一次代表大会是在这里举行的，还因为在这里燃起的星星之火，已经成为全世界到处燃烧的革命烈火。一位玻利维亚朋友说，他从遥远的拉丁美洲来到上海，就是真心诚意来参观这个地方的，因为这个地方不仅对中国具有伟大意义，对世界共产主义运动来说也具有伟大的意义。印度尼西亚一个工会代表团的朋友说：这地方象火炬一样照亮了革命的下一代。几内亚工会代表团的朋友说：我们参观中国共产党诞生地，是把这个纪念馆当作真理馆，它不仅是中国人民的纪念馆，而且也是我们几内亚人民和全世界人民的纪念馆。
    前来这里参观的外国朋友都热烈称颂中国共产党诞生的伟大历史意义。有的说：“俄国十月革命的胜利，震撼了全世界，中国共产党的成立，又一次震撼了全世界。”有的说：“中国共产党的创立，是中国人民和整个国际共产主义运动和工人运动中最有意义的事件。”有的说：“中国共产党的成立是世界革命力量发展中的一个伟大的里程碑。”他们联想起中国共产党敢于斗争敢于胜利的历史，连声赞扬中国共产党不愧为伟大的、光荣的、正确的党，不愧为真正的马克思列宁主义的革命政党。
    通过参观，越来越多的外国朋友更为深刻地懂得：中国共产党有伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为全党团结和革命的思想基础，有以毛主席为首的党中央的坚强领导。中国共产党是按照毛主席的建党思想和革命风格建立起来的，是一个理论和实践相结合的、密切联系群众的、有自我批评精神的无产阶级革命党。毛主席在中国共产党的各个历史时期，始终站在革命斗争风暴的最前头。毛主席面临中国革命极其复杂的情况，正确地提出了和解决了一系列的理论和策略问题。中国革命所以能够绕过一个又一个暗礁，夺取一个又一个阵地，从胜利走向更大的胜利，根本原因就在于有了毛主席，有了百战百胜的毛泽东思想。
    外国朋友对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜。当他们听到毛主席当年就是在这间小屋里参加中国共产党第一次代表大会时，压抑不住内心的激动。他们十分关心地问：毛主席当年坐在那张椅子上？很多外国朋友对这里陈列着的毛主席早期编写出版的革命刊物和毛主席的手稿等，非常重视。他们认真地看了一遍又一遍，有的还作了详细摘录。他们在留言中，热烈地歌颂了伟大领袖毛主席。一位泰国朋友写诗歌颂毛主席说：
    人民的力量是最伟大的力量，
    人的因素第一，而不是武器，
    这是我们敬爱老师的教导，
    这是一条千真万确的真理！
    在参观中，常常出现这样动人的情景：当外国朋友们在工作人员送给他们的纪念图片里见到第一张就是一九二五年拍摄的毛主席的照片时，欢喜万分，双手捧住毛主席的照片，有的还把照片高高举起，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”他们说“这是最最珍贵的礼物”，“我最幸福的就是得到这张照片”。有些外国朋友当场和接待他们的中国朋友一起，热情洋溢地高唱起《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《团结就是力量》等歌曲，越唱歌声越响，人们的心情越加激动。不少人在歌唱时，眼眶里含着兴奋、欢乐的泪花，情不自禁地高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”“毛泽东主席万岁！”
    “星星之火，可以燎原”是颠扑不破的真理
    不少外国朋友去过革命圣地延安，访问过革命摇篮井冈山，对中国共产党和毛主席领导全国人民夺取革命胜利历程中所进行的英勇斗争，有着十分深刻的印象。现在他们来到这里，在中国共产党第一次代表大会会址附设的陈列室里，看到了根据毛主席手迹复制的八个金光闪闪的大字：“星星之火，可以燎原”，感到特别亲切。他们知道，这是毛主席在三十多年前中国革命处在非常艰难的时期提出来的一句伟大的名言。如今，这一预言早已变为现实。革命的风暴已经席卷了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲广阔的土地。外国朋友在参观中，重温毛主席的这句名言。他们把“星星之火，可以燎原”这句话称为“颠扑不破的真理”，“革命力量的源泉”。有的外国朋友还欢呼：“星星之火万岁！”老挝朋友说，中国共产党的诞生及其经验充分证明：革命的力量，尽管开始的时候比较弱，但一旦透彻理解和掌握了无产阶级革命的学说，坚决地领导和团结人民同民族敌人和无产阶级的敌人进行彻底的斗争，相信自己的力量，依靠自己的力量，那末，就一定能够胜利。这个经验对已经起来和正在起来为自己祖国独立而战斗的老挝人民和世界人民，都具有极高的价值。阿根廷新闻工作者说：这个地方对全世界的马克思列宁主义者是一个最好的证明，证明了只要有一条把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同本国人民的具体实际相结合的正确的革命路线，星星之火，就一定可以燎原。
    “星星之火，可以燎原”这个伟大的真理，特别使一些来自长期坚持革命武装斗争前线的外国朋友受到莫大鼓舞，使他们进一步增强了敢于斗争的决心，进一步坚定了敢于胜利的信心。越南南方民族解放阵线的朋友说：如果说，过去中国革命是从星星之火开始燃烧起来，并在艰苦的斗争环境中取得了象今天那样的胜利，那么，我们越南南方人民也一定会取得辉煌的胜利。安哥拉朋友说：毛主席的话说得对。革命的发展都是从小到大的，革命者只要有正确的路线和革命的决心，革命事业就能不断地发展、壮大。安哥拉的革命斗争虽然遭到不少困难，但是，我们一定能战胜它！刚果（金）朋友说：星星之火已经在刚果平原点燃起来了，虽然我们还要付出很大的代价，甚至要付出自己的生命，但是刚果人民终将战胜貌似强大的帝国主义，取得革命的最后胜利。
    学习毛泽东思想，把革命进行到底
    来自五大洲的许多革命朋友，参观了中国共产党第一次代表大会的会址，都深刻地认识到，中国革命的胜利，是靠了百战百胜的毛泽东思想取得的。他们都表示，要努力读毛主席的书，进一步学习毛泽东思想，从毛泽东思想中不断汲取革命力量。
    日本朋友说：今天，日本人民对毛泽东思想的亲切感越来越深，毛泽东思想对长期以来从事反对美帝国主义斗争的日本人民的影响越来越大，这是促进日本人民不断革命的决定性力量。
    锡兰朋友说：毛泽东思想对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲革命人民都非常重要。毛泽东思想指引世界上被压迫的人民前进。没有毛泽东思想，就不可能进行争取民族解放的斗争；没有毛泽东思想，就不可能进行世界革命。
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的许多青年朋友说，在他们国家里，毛主席著作的学习小组越来越多，毛主席著作是他们最爱读的书，是指导革命工作最好的书。他们在中国到处看到，工农群众活学活用毛主席著作后，产生了无穷无尽的力量，这使他们留下了极为深刻的印象。参观了中国共产党第一次代表大会会址后，更激发了他们对学习毛泽东思想的强烈要求。
    一位随身带着毛主席著作到中国来访问的几内亚朋友说：“我最爱读毛主席著作，访问中国期间，在飞机上也读。《毛泽东选集》我已经读了好几遍，但我还要一遍一遍地读。因为毛泽东思想是指导革命的动力，我们一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想。”
    外国朋友每当参观完毕，总要和接待他们的中国朋友紧紧握手，合影留念，并纷纷题词。许多人在留言中表示坚信：有了毛泽东思想，有了中国做榜样，他们就什么敌人都不怕，就没有什么困难能挡住他们在革命的道路上胜利前进。非洲一个工会代表团的朋友说：一九一七年苏联建立了第一个社会主义国家，但是现在苏共领导集团已经变成了现代修正主义者。正由于中国共产党起来反对现代修正主义，捍卫马克思列宁主义，才使我们不至于跟着苏联现代修正主义瞎跑，不至于迷失方向。
    日本朋友说：要把革命进行到底是不容易的。有了以毛泽东思想为指导的、一贯坚持反帝反修斗争的中国共产党作为光辉的榜样，我们有决心把日本人民革命的火焰烧得更旺，直到全世界获得解放。
    智利朋友说：我们手里有个强大的武器——马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。虽然我国目前革命力量还弱小，但正如毛主席所说的那样，进步力量总是从小到大的，我们一定会强大起来。
    意大利和奥地利的革命青年说，以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党是世界革命的带路人，通过这次参观，我们得到了新的力量，增强了革命信心。目前我们的革命力量还小，但我们相信一定会发展壮大，我们一定要为保卫马克思列宁主义和反对现代修正主义，为争取祖国和全人类的解放，作出自己的贡献。
    许多外国朋友把参观称为“震撼心灵”“毕生难忘”“永志心中”的大事。他们说，今后，不管在革命道路上遇到多大的困难，只要想到上海这座具有世界意义的小房子，就会信心百倍，勇往直前。
