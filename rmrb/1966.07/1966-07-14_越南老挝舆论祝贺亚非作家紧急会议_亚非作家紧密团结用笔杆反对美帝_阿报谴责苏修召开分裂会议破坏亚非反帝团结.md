Vietnamese and Lao Public Opinion Congratulates the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers

Asian and African Writers Unite to Oppose U.S. Imperialism with Their Pens

Albanian Newspaper Condemns Soviet Revisionists for Holding a Split Conference, Damaging Asian and African Anti-Imperialist Unity

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 13th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary on July 12th, congratulating the Asian and African Writers Emergency Conference held in Beijing for achieving significant victories.

The commentary said that the Asian and African Writers Emergency Conference held in Beijing is of great significance to the struggle of Asian and African writers and peoples against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by U.S. imperialism. Asian and African writers have used their pens to denounce the U.S. aggression and war policies, the U.S. tactics of bribery and division, the cultural enslavement of imperialism, and the traitorous cliques that serve as imperialist running dogs and bring misfortune to their countries.

In discussing the resolution on the Vietnamese issue, the commentary pointed out that the resolution on the Vietnamese issue adopted by the Asian and African Writers Emergency Conference and the speeches made by the representatives at the conference on the Vietnamese issue are valuable support for Vietnamese writers and people. The commentary said that the complete success of the Asian and African Writers Emergency Conference held in Beijing is inseparable from the help and support of the Chinese Party, government, and people. The leaders of the Chinese Party and state expressed strong support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation when they met with the representatives of the conference.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Khamkeut: "The Voice of Laos" radio station published a commentary on July 5th, saying that the Asian and African Writers Emergency Conference held in Beijing once again affirmed the firm stance of Asian and African writers against new and old colonialism and imperialism led by the United States, and demonstrated the broad and close unity of Asian and African writers and peoples.

The commentary said: "The choice of Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, as the venue for the Asian and African Writers Emergency Conference is very correct and appropriate, because the People's Republic of China is the most resolute country in opposing new and old colonialism and imperialism led by the United States, and at the same time, it is an unshakable fortress that can withstand any storm. The broad and deep friendship of 700 million Chinese people with Asian and African friends is as endless as the sea. Therefore, the Asian and African Writers Emergency Conference held in Beijing received the wholehearted support and assistance of the Chinese government and people. The peoples of various Asian and African countries warmly welcome and support the conference, and warmly welcome the great contributions made by the Chinese government and people to the conference."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana: The editorial of the Albanian Writers Union's organ, "The Light Daily," recently published an article supporting the Asian and African Writers Emergency Conference held in Beijing and condemning the Soviet revisionists for plotting to hold a split conference in Cairo, damaging the anti-imperialist struggle and unity of Asian and African peoples.

The article said that the illegal split conference held in Cairo by the Soviet revisionists to oppose the unity of Asian and African progressive forces and create divisions is completely absurd. The broad representativeness and fighting spirit shown by the Asian and African Writers Emergency Conference held in Beijing indicate that the conference was a complete success, foiling the plots and tricks of the imperialists and revisionists.

The article said that Albanian writers and artists congratulate the Asian and African Writers Emergency Conference and express their fighting friendship and support to the progressive writers of the two continents of Asia and Africa.

　　越南老挝舆论祝贺亚非作家紧急会议
　　亚非作家紧密团结用笔杆反对美帝
　　阿报谴责苏修召开分裂会议破坏亚非反帝团结
    据新华社河内十三日电　越南《人民报》十二日发表评论，祝贺在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议取得重大胜利。
    评论说，在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议，是对亚非作家和亚非人民反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争有着重大意义的事件。亚非作家用自己的笔杆控诉美国的侵略和战争政策，控诉美国的收买和分裂手段，控诉帝国主义的奴役文化，控诉充当帝国主义走狗的祸国殃民的反动集团。
    评论在谈到关于越南问题决议时指出，亚非作家紧急会议关于越南问题的决议和代表们在会议上就越南问题所作的发言，是对越南作家和人民的宝贵支持。评论说，在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议取得完满成功，是同中国党、政府和人民的帮助和支持分不开的。中国党和国家领导人在同会议的代表们接触的时候，热情支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。
    据新华社康开电　“老挝之声”电台五日发表评论说，在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议，再一次肯定了亚非作家反对新老殖民主义和以美国为首的帝国主义的坚定立场，显示了亚非作家和人民的广泛的紧密团结。
    评论说：“亚非作家紧急会议选择中华人民共和国首都北京作为开会地点是十分正确和适合的，因为中华人民共和国是反对新老殖民主义和以美国为首的帝国主义最坚决的国家，同时也是任何风暴都动摇不了的坚固堡垒。七亿中国人民对亚非朋友的广泛和深厚的团结情谊，象大海一样永不枯竭。因此，亚非作家紧急会议在北京召开，得到了中国政府和人民的全心全意的支持和帮助。亚非各国人民热烈欢迎和支持上述会议，并热烈欢迎中国政府和人民对会议作出的巨大贡献。”
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚作家协会机关报《光明报》最近发表编辑部文章，支持在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议，谴责苏联修正主义者策划召开开罗分裂会议，破坏亚非人民反帝斗争和团结。
    文章说，苏联修正主义者为了反对亚非进步力量的团结，制造分裂，在开罗召开的非法的分裂会议是完全荒谬的。在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议所具有的广泛的代表性和会议表现出的战斗精神表明，这个会议取得了完全的成功，挫败了帝国主义者和修正主义者的阴谋诡计。
    文章说，阿尔巴尼亚作家、艺术家祝贺亚非作家紧急会议，并对亚非两大洲的进步作家表示他们的战斗友谊和支持。
