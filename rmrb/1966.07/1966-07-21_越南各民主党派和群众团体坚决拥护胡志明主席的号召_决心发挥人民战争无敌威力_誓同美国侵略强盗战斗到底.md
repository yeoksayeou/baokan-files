Vietnamese democratic parties and mass organizations have issued statements and calls to action, enthusiastically responding to and resolutely supporting Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great battle call. They are determined to carry forward the heroic traditions of the Vietnamese people, to unleash the invincible power of people's war, to thoroughly defeat American imperialism, and to strive for complete victory in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

A statement issued by the Vietnamese Democratic Party on the 20th said: Chairman Ho's call is a magnificent battle cry, inspiring all the Vietnamese people to press forward bravely, determined to annihilate the American aggressors and to defend the sacred independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the motherland. The Vietnamese Democratic Party, together with all the people, sternly warns American imperialism: Do not dream, do not foolishly imagine. All your deceitful "peace" talks and cunning "negotiation" schemes will deceive no one. The Vietnamese people, inheriting the tradition of resisting foreign invaders, will not waver in the face of the brutal and mad war actions and cunning deception of the American imperialist paper tiger.

The statement points out that even if American imperialism dares to bomb the capital Hanoi, bomb other cities and enterprises, even if the Vietnamese people have to endure countless hardships, even if they have to face storms and tempests, the Vietnamese people will remain loyal to the revolution and will resolutely contribute all their strength to support their compatriots in the South in annihilating the American aggressors.

A statement issued by the Vietnamese Socialist Party on the 18th said: The Vietnamese Socialist Party, together with patriotic people of all strata throughout the country, will respond to Chairman Ho's call, determined to fight for five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer, ready to overcome all difficulties and make any sacrifice, and definitely to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

The statement expresses that the Vietnamese working class and laboring people, more than ever, will carry forward the revolutionary vanguard role of the working class and the heroic fighting traditions of the nation, fearing neither the threats and sabotage of American imperialism nor hardships and sacrifices, constantly enhancing revolutionary vigilance and self-reliance. The statement says: "With the iron will of all our military and civilian people, with the invincible people's war that has won a hundred battles and a hundred victories, the just cause of our working class and people to resist American aggression and save the nation will definitely win! American imperialism will definitely be thoroughly defeated!"

The Vietnamese Women's Union issued a call to action saying: Vietnamese women can endure all hardships and sacrifices, but they cannot endure the humiliation of national subjugation. For the survival of the motherland, Vietnamese women will unite as one, bravely press forward, and make the American aggressors pay for their blood debts! They are willing to shed their last drop of blood to defend the motherland. They have an unshakable resolve to unleash the invincible power of the Vietnamese nation and women, definitely to defeat the aggression of American imperialism, and to bravely fight on until complete victory.
