Scientists from Various Countries at the Beijing Physics Symposium Resolve to Uphold Self-Reliance, Break Imperialist Monopoly, and Develop National Science and Culture

Seventy-eight scientists from seventeen countries presented a total of eighty-three papers or reports.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 29th, today was the last day of academic exchanges at the 1966 Summer Physics Symposium of the Beijing Science Symposium. Through six days of rich and varied academic exchanges, scientists from four continents have further strengthened their confidence in developing national scientific endeavors on the basis of anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism, and self-reliance.

Scientists from seventeen countries presented a total of eighty-three academic papers or reports at the plenary session or academic meetings held in groups. In addition to those presented at the meeting, sixteen more papers were distributed to scientists from various countries.

Many scientists pointed out that this Beijing Physics Symposium once again demonstrates that the era of imperialist monopoly over science has passed. As long as scientists and peoples from four continents continue to fight imperialism and neo-colonialism to the end, adhere to the principle of self-reliance, and strengthen mutual unity and cooperation, they will definitely be able to accelerate the development of national science and culture and catch up with the world's advanced level.

During the six days of academic exchanges, scientists from various countries freely expressed their views, and the meeting was filled with a democratic atmosphere of free debate. At the meeting, every scientist could freely submit a paper, either orally or in writing. Each paper presented at the meeting was seriously discussed. Many scientists who were previously unfamiliar with each other not only engaged in heated discussions at the meeting but also gathered in small groups after the meeting to exchange academic views and discuss common interests. Some foreign scientists who had participated in many international academic conferences pointed out that the atmosphere of mutual respect, mutual learning, unity, and common progress at the Beijing Physics Symposium was something never seen at Western academic conferences.

This morning, Pakistani scientist Professor Abdus Salam, who had just arrived in Beijing to participate in this physics symposium, gave an academic report to scientists from various countries at the plenary session.

In his report, Salam introduced the development of basic particle theory in the West over the past decade and some of his recent work. Salam admitted that many phenomena cannot be explained by the previously popular symmetry theory, indicating that basic particles should have internal structure. He has been exploring some issues related to the weak decay of strongly interacting particles from the perspective that basic particles have structure since the beginning of this year. Salam said he was deeply impressed by the work of the Beijing Basic Particle Theory Group on the structure of basic particles. He hoped that by the time the Beijing Science Symposium is held in 1968, significant progress will have been made in basic particle theory. Salam's report aroused great interest among scientists from various countries, who engaged in heated discussions at the meeting.

After listening to Salam's report, scientists from various countries continued to hold academic meetings in groups.

At the academic meeting of the basic particle physics group, Chinese physicist Wang Zhengzhi, representing the basic particle physics group of the Physics Department of Shandong University, presented a paper on symmetry theory. The paper introduced how the faculty and students of the Physics Department of Shandong University, guided by Chairman Mao's philosophy of "one divides into two," used rigorous methods to conduct a large number of calculations and comparisons with experiments in a short period, proving that the study of basic particle classification using phenomenological symmetry theory has great limitations. This paper further demonstrated the importance of studying the structure of basic particles. Mexican scientist Pena presented a paper titled "A New Nonlinear Equation for Describing Basic Particles."

Japanese scientists Yosimasa Yokoi, Hiroshi Tawara, and Kiyoshi Danjo made specialized presentations on the conservation laws of basic particle weak interactions and some issues related to astrophysics and cosmic rays.

Japanese scientists Yasuhisa Yoshizawa and Kyu Hisa, at the academic meeting of the nuclear physics group, presented their papers "Nuclear Energy Spectrum Research in Japan" and "Recent Nuclear Research Based on Nucleons." Iraqi scientist Jita, Peter Geishi representing the East African Academy of Sciences, Sri Lankan scientist Disanayaka, North Korean scientist Kim Young-bong, Pakistani scientist Siddiq, and Japanese scientist Yasuhisa Yoshizawa successively introduced the research situation in nuclear physics in their countries.

Chinese scientist Tang Yaqing, representing the Material Structure Research Group of Jilin University, presented a paper titled "Research on Ligand Field Theory" at the academic meeting of the solid-state physics group, which attracted the attention of the attendees. The paper showed that the scientific workers of the Material Structure Research Group of Jilin University used Chairman Mao's works as the guiding direction for scientific experiments, dared to think and act, and in a short period enriched and developed the theory of ligand fields, providing new theoretical bases for the development of China's chemical industry catalysts and laser-induced emission and other scientific technologies.

Japanese scientists Hiroshi Fujimoto, Hiroshi Momota, Shinichiro Nagasaka, and Keiji Yamada presented four papers at the meeting. Their paper titles were: "Development of Plasma Physics in Japan," "Research and Control of Thermonuclear Fusion in Japan," "Creative Development of Solid-State Physics in Japan," and "Activities of the Solid-State Physics Group at Nagoya University."

At the academic meeting of the physics education group, four scientists presented papers: Colombian scientist Gamba's "Basic Views on Modern Physics Education," Sierra Leonean scientist Jallo's "Physics Education in an African University," Japanese scientist Seiichi Wakai's "Democracy and Scientific Activities of the Laboratory Committee," and Chinese physicist Wang Chengrui, representing the Physics Department of Shandong University, presented "Experience in Organizing Physics Students to Participate in Technological Innovation."

    北京物理讨论会各国科学家决心贯彻自力更生精神
    打破帝国主义垄断　发展民族科学文化
    十七国的七十八位科学家分别宣读八十三篇论文或报告
    据新华社二十九日讯  今天是北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会进行学术交流活动的最后一天。四大洲各国科学家通过六天来丰富多采的学术交流，进一步增强了在反帝反殖、自力更生的基础上发展各国民族科学事业的信心。
    有十七个国家的七十八位科学家，在讨论会的全体会议上或者分组举行的学术会议上，分别宣读了八十三篇学术论文或学术报告，广泛地讨论了物理学各个领域中的学术问题。除了在会上宣读的以外，还有十六篇论文在会上散发给了各国科学家。
    许多科学家指出，这次北京物理讨论会再一次向人们表明，帝国主义垄断科学的时代已经一去不复返了，四大洲各国科学家和人民只要继续把反对帝国主义和反对新老殖民主义的斗争进行到底，贯彻自力更生的方针，加强相互间的团结合作，就一定可以加速发展本国的民族科学文化事业，赶上世界先进水平。
    在六天来的学术交流活动中，各国科学家各抒己见，畅所欲言，会上充满了自由争论的学术民主空气。会上，每一位科学家都可以自由地提出论文，或者口头宣读，或者书面散发。会上宣读的每一篇论文，都得到了认真的讨论。许多过去互不相识的各国科学家，不仅在会上展开热烈的讨论，会后还三五成群地交流学术见解，探讨共同感兴趣的问题。一些曾经参加过多次国际学术会议的外国科学家指出，洋溢在北京物理讨论会上的那一股互相尊重、互相学习、团结合作、共同提高的动人气氛，在西方学术会议上是从来看不到的。
    今天上午，刚刚赶到北京参加这次物理讨论会的巴基斯坦科学家萨拉姆教授，在全体会议上向各国科学家作了学术报告。
    萨拉姆教授在报告中介绍了西方基本粒子理论十年来的发展情况和他在最近所进行的一部分工作。萨拉姆在报告中承认，有不少现象是过去流行的对称性理论所不能说明的，这表明基本粒子应具有内部结构。他从今年初已经开始以基本粒子有结构的观点，初步探讨了强相互作用粒子弱衰变的一些问题。萨拉姆说，他看到了北京基本粒子理论组在基本粒子结构方面所进行的工作，印象很深刻。他希望在一九六八年北京科学讨论会举行的时候，基本粒子理论能取得长足的进展。萨拉姆的报告引起各国科学家的很大兴趣。他们在会上进行了热烈的讨论。
    在听了萨拉姆的报告之后，各国科学家继续分组举行了学术会议。
    在基本粒子物理组学术会议上，中国物理学工作者王政之代表山东大学物理系基本粒子物理组宣读的一篇有关对称性理论的论文，介绍了山东大学物理系师生以毛主席的“一分为二”的哲学思想为指导，在短时间内用严密的方法进行大量计算并和实验作比较，证明了用唯象对称性理论来研究基本粒子的分类是有很大局限性的。这篇论文从另一个方面说明了研究基本粒子结构的重要性。墨西哥科学家佩纳，在会上宣读了题为《一种新的描述基本粒子的非线性方程》的论文。
    日本科学家横尾由松、田原博人和丹生洁，分别就基本粒子弱相互作用的守恒定律以及天体物理和宇宙线方面的一些问题，在会上作了专题性的发言。
    日本科学家吉泽康和、阿部恭久，在原子核物理组学术会议上分别宣读了他们的论文《日本的原子核能谱学研究》和《最近一些以核子为基础的原子核研究》。伊拉克科学家吉塔，东非科学院代表彼得·盖希，锡兰科学家迪萨奈克，朝鲜科学家金应丰，巴基斯坦科学家西迪克和日本科学家吉泽康和，先后介绍了他们国家在原子核物理方面的研究情况。
    中国科学工作者唐敖庆，在固体物理组学术会议上代表吉林大学物质结构研究组宣读的一篇论文《配位场理论的研究》，引起了到会者的重视。这篇论文说明，吉林大学物质结构研究组的科学工作者，把毛主席著作当作科学实验的指导方向，敢想敢干，在较短的时间内丰富和发展了配位场的理论，为发展我国化学工业的催化剂和受激光发射等科学技术提供了新的理论根据。
    日本科学家藤本孝、百田弘、长坂慎一郎和山田庆治，分别在会上宣读了四篇论文。他们的论文题目是：《日本等离子体物理的发展》、《日本等离子体物理的研究及控制热核熔解》、《日本固体物理创造性发展的情况》和《名古屋大学固体物理小组的活动》。
    在物理教学组学术会议上有四位科学家宣读了论文，这就是哥伦比亚科学家甘巴的《关于现代物理教学的基本看法》，塞拉勒窝内科学家贾洛的《非洲一个大学的物理教学》，日本科学家若泉诚一的《试验室委员会的民主和科学活动》，中国物理学工作者王承瑞代表山东大学物理系宣读的《组织物理系学生参加技术革新的体会》。
