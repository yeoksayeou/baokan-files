The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam calls on all military and civilian personnel to advance bravely and strive for greater victories. Defeating the American imperialists is the unshakable iron will of the South Vietnamese military and civilians. Actively promote the three high tides of armed struggle, political struggle, and the dissolution of the puppet soldiers.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, July 18th - According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency: The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a call on July 10th to commemorate the 12th anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Agreement on July 20th. The call urges all military and civilian personnel to build on the great victories already achieved, to unite closely, to advance bravely with one heart and one mind, to decisively defeat the American imperialists' war of aggression, to overthrow the puppet regime, to actively promote the three high tides of armed struggle, political struggle, and the dissolution of the puppet soldiers, to strive for even greater new victories, and to achieve a thorough victory in the people's war of national salvation.

The full text of the call is as follows:

Dear fellow countrymen, cadres, and soldiers:

For the past twelve years, our 14 million compatriots in South Vietnam have inherited the unyielding tradition of our ancestors and the nine-year tradition of victory against French colonial invaders and American interventionists. We have risen up again to fight against American aggressors and traitorous lackeys, to struggle for our right to exist, our right to freedom, and our right to build a happy life. The people and the liberation army of South Vietnam have overcome countless difficulties and hardships, stepping on the enemy to advance, achieving one victory after another: We have destroyed the "strategic hamlets," which were the basis of the fascist dictatorship of the American-Brutal regime, defeated the "special war" of the American-puppet group, and in the 1965-1966 dry season, maintained the initiative on the battlefield, initially defeated the American imperialists' plan to strengthen and expand the war of aggression, and won the first round against the most powerful and modern army of imperialism—the U.S. expeditionary forces! Our vast liberated areas have been further consolidated and expanded. The patriotic movement of the urban compatriots in the South is surging. The prestige and influence of the National Liberation Front, both domestically and internationally, are increasingly expanding. We have achieved tremendous victories in military, political, and diplomatic fields.

The American imperialists are increasingly isolated, mired in a quagmire, and in a desperate situation. The whole world is condemning them. The puppet army and puppet regime are increasingly disintegrating and have reached the height of decay. The American imperialists will suffer a thorough defeat in their war of aggression against our country. The complete collapse and disintegration of the puppet army and puppet regime in the South is inevitable.

With bare hands, we have achieved such glorious victories because our 14 million compatriots are united, highly displaying heroic spirit, willing to sacrifice everything rather than kneel and surrender to become slaves of the aggressors, determined to fight to the end and win independence and freedom. We have also received the wholehearted support of our 17 million compatriots in the North, as well as the precious sympathy and support of the socialist countries and the brothers and sisters and friends of the five continents, including the American people.

Dear compatriots, cadres, and soldiers!

Although the American bandits have suffered a crushing defeat, they remain very obstinate, still lingering in our South Vietnam, still intensifying the war of aggression against the South and expanding the war of destruction against the North; on the other hand, they are incessantly repeating the deceptive rhetoric of "peace talks" to deceive public opinion. They are using extremely brutal means of war on both the South and the North, and they have meticulously planned very cunning conspiracies.

At present, in the South, 300,000 American and allied troops are rampant, their iron hooves trampled the streets of the cities and the fields of our compatriots, using guns, planes, tanks, napalm, poison gas, and chemical poisons to kill people, plunder wealth, burn houses, destroy temples, churches, and sanctuaries, bomb schools, and ravage our homeland.

In the North, they continue to expand the war of destruction, bombing the capital Hanoi and the city of Haiphong.

The American bandits and their lackeys have committed and are committing the most brutal crimes in the history of mankind on our land. The beautiful rivers and mountains that our ancestors have built through generations of hard work are today sold to the American bandits by the treacherous group of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky.

No matter how brutal and cunning the conspiracies and means are, they cannot stop us from advancing. As long as the American imperialists continue to wage war of aggression against the South, our people will resolutely fight to the end. We are not afraid of how long the war will last, we are not afraid of difficulties and hardships, we are determined to defeat the American imperialists' war of aggression, overthrow the puppet regime, liberate the South, defend the North, achieve an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral South Vietnam, and ultimately reunify the country. This is the unshakable iron will of all our military and civilian personnel.

Our current situation is limitlessly good!

Our current strength is unprecedentedly strong!

The hatred of all our compatriots for the American aggressors and traitorous lackeys is burning more fiercely than ever.

We have enough material and spiritual foundations to win the final victory. We will certainly achieve complete victory in any situation.

Dear compatriots, cadres, and soldiers!

Our nation is living in a great historical moment!

Our motherland is calling!

The whole country has risen!

All progressive humanity is watching us. We are determined to fulfill our glorious historical mission.

All our military and civilian personnel must build on the great victories already achieved, unite closely, advance bravely with one heart and one mind, decisively defeat the American imperialists' war of aggression, overthrow the puppet regime, actively promote the three high tides of armed struggle, political struggle, and the dissolution of the puppet soldiers, strive for even greater new victories, and achieve a thorough victory in the people's war of national salvation!

The liberation armed forces and the militia guerrilla units must highly display the creativity of the people's war, continuously attack and annihilate more American-puppet troops, maintain and develop our initiative, frustrate the enemy's various "sweeping" operations, shatter the American bandits' aggressive ambitions, vigorously and extensively develop guerrilla warfare, always uphold the people-serving viewpoint, care for and protect the people's lives and property, strive to build our forces to grow rapidly, advance bravely, and strive for greater victories in the rainy and dry seasons and on all battlefields!

The compatriots in the mountain base areas and rural liberated areas must strengthen unity, actively consolidate and expand the base areas and rural liberated areas, display the spirit of the people being the masters of the liberated areas, shatter the American "pacification," encroachment, and concentration of residents plans, shatter spy activities, care for and protect lives and property, promote production, gradually improve material and spiritual life, develop cultural, health, and educational undertakings, actively contribute manpower and resources to the anti-American, national salvation war! The compatriots in the rural areas temporarily controlled by the enemy must rise up, destroy the enemy's ruling organs, oppose the enemy's oppression, exploitation, and deception, vigorously promote political and armed struggle!

The workers, laborers, students, university students, youth, small traders, handicraftsmen, intellectuals, businesspeople, prominent figures, and religious believers in the cities of South Vietnam! The source of all oppression and suffering of our compatriots in the cities of South Vietnam is the appearance of the American expeditionary forces, the blatant intervention and aggression policy of American imperialism, and the fascist dictatorship of the American lackeys Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky. The recent perpetrators of the bloody massacres in various cities in the South are precisely them! To expand the great national unity front, continuously attack the enemy, persist in and develop the movement against the American aggressors and their lackeys Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky, struggle for national sovereignty and various democratic rights, demand that the Americans must stop the war of aggression, destroy the enemy's ruling organs, organize self-defense forces, oppose suppression and persecution, oppose conscription, oppose plundering and exploitation, oppose the demolition of civilian houses and the seizure of land, oppose decadent culture, shatter the deceptions of "building democracy," "electing a constituent assembly," "military-civilian consultation committee," "stabilizing the economy," "social revolution," etc., demand the freedom of assembly, association, demonstrations, marches, freedom of speech, and freedom of belief, demand the improvement of living conditions and the establishment of an independent and self-reliant economy. Only by uniting, resolutely opposing American imperialism to the end, shattering the intervention and aggression policy of American imperialism, overthrowing the treacherous group of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky, and establishing a genuine people's government representing the will and wishes of the entire people, can we achieve national independence, democracy, freedom, peace, and improved living conditions!

Overseas compatriots! Display patriotism, turn your hearts to the motherland, and support the anti-American, national salvation war of the entire people in all possible ways!

All patriotic Vietnamese, put national affairs first, the motherland above all! For the survival of the nation, for the freedom and happiness of the entire people, set aside differences in political views and tendencies, unite with the National Liberation Front, work together, oppose the American aggressors and traitorous lackeys!

Soldiers and civil servants in the puppet regime of the South! Do not follow the orders of the American bandits and the treacherous group of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky to kill compatriots and destroy homes! Turn your guns on the American bandits and the extremely evil lackeys, surrender with weapons and join the people to save the country and the family! Officers in the puppet army of the South! The American bandits and the group of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky are using the blood of puppet army officers to maintain their rule, but they ruthlessly suppress and persecute all officers and soldiers with national spirit. For the sake of the country's interests and your personal future, rely on the people, unite with the National Liberation Front, and together drive away the American aggressors and traitorous lackeys, seize back independence and freedom!

Under the banner of the victorious National Liberation Front, all our military and civilian personnel must bravely advance, overcome all difficulties and hardships, and be determined to perfectly complete the glorious historical mission!

We are determined to thoroughly defeat the American imperialists' war of aggression!

We will certainly achieve complete victory!

　　南越民族解放阵线中央号召全体军民奋勇前进争取更大胜利
　　打败美帝是南越军民不可动摇的钢铁决心
　　积极促进武装斗争、政治斗争和瓦解伪军士兵三个高潮
    新华社河内十八日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会十日就“七·二○”日内瓦协议签订十二周年发表号召书，号召全体军民必须发扬已取得的巨大胜利，紧密团结，万众一心，奋勇前进，决心打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，推翻走狗伪政权，积极促进武装斗争、政治斗争和瓦解伪军士兵三个高潮，争取更加巨大的新胜利，使越南人民的救国抗战取得彻底胜利。号召书全文如下：亲爱的全体同胞、干部和战士们：
    一千四百万我国南方同胞继承先辈的不屈不挠传统，和九年胜利地反对法国殖民侵略者和美国干涉者的抗战传统，在过去十二年中又起来反对美国侵略强盗和卖国走狗，争取自己的生存权利、自由权利和建设幸福的权利。南方人民和解放军克服无数艰难困苦，把敌人踩在脚下前进，接连取得一个又一个的胜利：我们捣毁了作为美吴法西斯独裁统治基础的“战略村”，打败了美伪集团的“特种战争”，并在一九六五年——一九六六年旱季中，保持了战场上的主动权，初步打败了美帝国主义加强和扩大侵略战争的计划，在第一回合中战胜了帝国主义最强大和最现代化的军队——美国远征军！我们广大的解放区进一步得到巩固和扩大。南方城市同胞的爱国运动汹涌澎湃。民族解放阵线在国内和国际上的威信和影响日益扩大。我们在军事、政治和外交方面都取得了十分巨大的胜利。
    美帝国主义日益遭到孤立，深陷泥潭和穷途末路的处境。全世界正在谴责它。伪军和伪政权日益瓦解，腐朽到了顶点。美帝国主义在侵略我国战争中遭到彻底失败，南方伪军和伪政权的彻底崩溃和瓦解是不可避免的。
    赤手空拳起来取得如此辉煌胜利，是因为我们一千四百万同胞团结一致，高度发扬英雄气概，宁愿牺牲一切而不屈膝投降甘当侵略者的奴隶，决心不惜牺牲地战斗，必定要争取到独立和自由。我们又得到一千七百万北方骨肉同胞的全心全力的支持，以及社会主义国家和包括美国人民在内的五大洲兄弟姐妹和朋友的宝贵的同情和支持。
    亲爱的同胞、干部和战士们！
    美国强盗虽然遭到了惨败，仍然表现十分顽固，仍然赖在我国南方不走，仍然加紧加强侵略南方的战争，扩大对北方的破坏性战争；另一方面，它又喋喋不休地重弹“和平讨论”的欺骗论调，以便蒙骗舆论。它在南北两方采取极端残暴的战争手段，它精心策划了十分狡猾的阴谋。
    目前，在南方，三十万名美国和仆从国军队横行霸道，它们的铁蹄踏遍了城市的街道和我国同胞的田园，使用枪炮、飞机、坦克、凝固汽油弹、毒气、化学毒药，大肆杀人，抢夺财富，烧毁房屋，破坏寺庙、教堂和圣室，轰炸学校，毁坏我们的故乡。
    在北方，它们不断扩大破坏性战争，轰炸首都河内和海防市。
    美国强盗及其走狗已经和正在我国土地上犯下人类历史上最残暴的罪行。我们祖辈经过世世代代的辛勤劳动所创建的锦绣河山，今天被阮文绍—阮高其叛国集团出卖给美国强盗。
    任何阴谋和手段，不管残暴和狡猾到什么程度，也不能使我们停止前进。美帝国主义还在继续进行侵略南方的战争，我国人民就坚决抗战到底。我们不怕要打多久，我们不怕艰难困苦，决心打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，推翻走狗政权，解放南方，保卫北方，实现独立、民主、和平和中立的越南南方，进而统一祖国。这就是我们全体军民不可动摇的钢铁决心。
    我们目前的形势无限好！
    我们目前的力量空前强大！
    我们全体同胞对美国侵略强盗和卖国走狗集团的仇恨烈火燃烧的空前旺盛。
    我们有了足够的物质和精神基础争取最后胜利。我们必将在任何情况下获得全胜。
    亲爱的同胞、干部和战士们！
    我们民族正生活在重大的历史时刻里！
    我们的祖国在召唤！
    全国站起来了！
    全体进步人类正注视着我们。我们决心完成光荣的历史使命。
    我们全军和全民必须发扬已取得的巨大胜利，紧密团结，万众一心，奋勇前进，决心打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，推翻走狗伪政权，积极促进武装斗争、政治斗争和瓦解伪军士兵三个高潮，争取更加巨大的新胜利，使我国人民的救国抗战取得彻底胜利！
    解放武装力量和民兵游击队必须高度发挥人民战争的创造性，连续进攻和消灭更多的美伪军有生力量，保持和发展我们的主动权，挫败敌人的各次“扫荡”，粉碎美国强盗的侵略野心，大力和广泛发展游击战争，经常树立为人民服务的观点，关怀和保卫人民的生命和财产，努力建设我们的力量使之迅速壮大，奋勇前进，在雨季和旱季中，在各个战场上，争取日益巨大的胜利！
    山区根据地和农村解放区的同胞们，必须加强团结，积极巩固和扩大根据地和农村解放区，发扬我们人民做解放区主人的精神，粉碎美国的“绥靖”、蚕食和集中居民的计划，粉碎间谍活动，关怀和保卫生命和财产，促进生产，逐步改善物质和精神生活，发展文化、卫生和教育事业，积极为抗战贡献人力物力，以便进行抗美救国的抗战！敌人暂时控制的农村地区的同胞们，必须举行起义，摧毁敌人的统治机构，反对敌人的压迫、剥削和欺骗，大力促进政治和武装斗争！
    南方城市的工人、劳动者、学生、大学生、青年、小商贩、手工业者、知识分子、工商界人士、知名人士和宗教徒们！我国南方城市同胞目前的一切压抑和痛苦的来源，是美国远征军的出现，是美帝国主义的明目张胆的干涉和侵略政策，是美国走狗阮文绍—阮高其集团的法西斯独裁统治制度。最近在南方各城市制造血腥屠杀事件的主犯正是它们！要扩大民族大团结阵线，连续进攻敌人，坚持和发展反对美国侵略者及其走狗阮文绍—阮高其集团的运动，为争取民族主权和各项民主权利而进行斗争，要求美国必须停止侵略战争，摧毁敌人的统治机构，组织武装自卫队，反对镇压与迫害，反对抓兵，反对搜括、剥削，反对拆除民房、强占土地，反对颓废的文化，粉碎“建设民主”、“选举立宪国会”、“军民谘询委员会”、“稳定经济”、
  “社会革命”等骗局，要求集会、结社、示威游行的自由，言论自由、信仰自由，要求改善生活和建立独立自主的经济。只有团结起来，坚决反对美帝国主义到底，粉碎美帝国主义的干涉和侵略政策，推翻阮文绍—阮高其越奸集团、建立一个代表全民的意志和愿望的真正的人民政权，才能有民族独立、民主自由、和平和改善生活！
    海外侨胞们！发扬爱国精神，心向祖国，以各种方式大力支援我国全民的抗美救国抗战！
    所有每个爱国的越南人，以国事为重，祖国高于一切！为了民族的生存，为了全民的自由和幸福，放弃政见和倾向方面的分歧，同民族解放阵线统一行动，同心协力，反对美国侵略强盗和卖国走狗！
    南方伪政权中的士兵和公务员们！不要听从美国强盗和阮文绍—阮高其卖国集团的命令而屠杀同胞、破坏家园！要把枪口转向美国强盗和罪大恶极的走狗，携械投诚同人民一起救国救家！南方伪军中的军官们！美国强盗和阮文绍—阮高其集团正在利用伪军军官的鲜血来维持它们的统治，却毫不留情地对一切具有民族精神的军官和士兵进行镇压和迫害。为了祖国的利益，为了个人的前途，你们要依靠人民，同解放阵线联合行动，共同把美国侵略强盗和卖国走狗赶走，把独立和自由夺回来！
    在民族解放阵线必胜的救国旗帜下，我们全体军民要勇敢前进，克服一切艰难困苦，决心要最完满地完成光荣的历史任务！
    我们决心彻底打败美帝国主义的侵略战争！
    我们必将取得全胜！
