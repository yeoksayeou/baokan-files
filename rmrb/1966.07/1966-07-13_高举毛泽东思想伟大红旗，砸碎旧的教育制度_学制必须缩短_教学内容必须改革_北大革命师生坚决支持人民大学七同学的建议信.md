Hoist High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Smash the Old Educational System

Shorten the School System, Reform the Teaching Content

Revolutionary Teachers and Students in Beijing Strongly Support the Suggestion Letter from Seven Students of Renmin University

BEIJING, July 12 — Revolutionary teachers and students at Peking University have enthusiastically responded to and supported the suggestion letter from seven students of Renmin University to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao regarding the reform of the liberal arts university system. On July 12, representatives from some classes and teachers held a meeting to denounce how the old system and educational institutions obstruct the youth from taking the revolutionary path.

On the morning of July 12, after students saw the suggestion letter from the seven students of Renmin University in the People's Daily, they immediately posted big-character posters and wrote letters of congratulations, expressing their firm support. Students believe that this suggestion is a book of accusations against the old educational system, a challenge to thoroughly break with the old educational system, and a declaration to create a new proletarian educational system. Many revolutionary teachers and students at the meeting expressed that the suggestion from Renmin University students spoke their minds, representing the common wishes and demands of the students. They will definitely hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, smash all old educational systems, and establish a brand-new socialist educational system.

A third-year student in the Law Department, Ai Caiguo, said at the meeting, "The letter from the seven students of Renmin University spoke our minds. We request the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to approve our early graduation, allowing us to go to the three great revolutionary movements to reform ourselves and contribute everything to the liberation cause of the Chinese and world laboring people." He said, "I am the son of a poor peasant. In 1963, I entered Peking University with the ardent hopes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, hoping to become a successor to the cause of the proletarian revolution. However, Peking University at that time was not a school for the laboring people. The black gang of Lu Ping stubbornly pushed the revisionist educational line, intending to train us into successors of bourgeois revisionism. We, the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, have an infinite love for Mao Zedong Thought, believing that the Law Department should make the works of Chairman Mao compulsory courses. We should go to the three great revolutionary movements, combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and make class struggle the main course. However, the black gang of Lu Ping tried every means to prevent us from studying the works of Chairman Mao and opposed our combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers. They used the excuse of training legal professionals to emphasize book knowledge alone, guiding students to detach from politics and delve into ancient books. Some students were poisoned and slid to the edge of revisionism; some students from worker and peasant families, after studying for a few years, even had their class feelings diluted."

A fifth-year student in the Philosophy Department, Sun Yongqing, said, "After studying in Peking University for five years, I deeply feel that the old educational system is a tool for training successors of revisionism. The old Peking University was a big dye vat of revisionism. We demand to thoroughly smash the old educational system and carry the Cultural Revolution of Peking University to the end, thoroughly overturning revisionism." He said, "The black gang of Lu Ping wanted us to find 'dialectics' in the pile of ancient and dead people, kneel down before Confucius, but did not allow us to study the works of Chairman Mao. The black gang members and revisionist elements who gave us lectures poisoned us in the classroom, attacking Mao Zedong Thought and the three red banners, opposing the combination of theory with practice. The four philosophical essays of Chairman Mao, they never seriously lectured on, but they propagated poisonous weeds like 'Yanshan Night Talk.' I fully agree with the suggestion from the seven students of Renmin University. I am about to graduate, and I promise to the Party and Chairman Mao that I will now firmly join the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, open fire on the black gang, and thoroughly eliminate their influence. I firmly request to be assigned to the most arduous and needed places, to the border, countryside, and grassroots, to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to contribute my life to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution."

Students Wang Xintian from the Library Science Department, Ren Yaofang from the International Politics Department, and Li Zongrong from the Chinese Department strongly denounced the harm of the old educational system in their speeches. Wang Xintian said, "The Library Science Department was originally a two-year program, then changed to three years, four years, and starting from 1964, even graduate students were recruited. The anti-party and anti-socialist black gang in the department openly told students that after graduation, they would all stay in urban libraries as researchers and managers, and there was no need to go to the countryside. He even said, 'You are serving a few (bourgeois) experts.' This is such a dangerous and vicious method of poisoning students! We firmly demand to smash the old educational system and firmly go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers." Li Zongrong said, "Under the control of the black gang of Lu Ping, the old Peking University obstructed us from studying the works of Chairman Mao and combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers everywhere. They lectured, opening with Plekhanov and closing with Belinsky, intending to seal our mouths with ancient and foreign things, dissolving our proletarian thoughts with bourgeois ideas." Ren Yaofang said, "To smash the old educational system, we must first seize the leadership of the school from the hands of the bourgeois anti-party and anti-socialist black gang, open fire on all bourgeois 'authorities' and 'experts,' and only then can we hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and build a true socialist new Peking University."

A fourth-year student in the Biology Department, Chen Hongkui, said, "The ten crimes of the current system proposed by the seven students of Renmin University not only exist in the liberal arts; they also exist in the sciences. We also propose: the science system must be reformed."

A teacher from the Chinese Department, Yang Fuxin, said, "The seven students of Renmin University proposed what we had thought of but dared not propose. Currently, the university system is generally five years, and graduate school is three to four years, just studying in Peking University would take nine years, but nine years of revolutionary struggle can train how many revolutionary successors! More seriously, the old universities not only have long systems, but their teaching content is detached from reality, and the students trained are not more sympathetic to workers and peasants but become more stupid and unwilling to go to the masses of workers and peasants and grassroots units to serve the people. The system must be shortened, and the teaching content must be reformed. The old educational system must be thoroughly smashed to uproot revisionism." He said, "I support the suggestion from the seven students of Renmin University a thousand times, ten thousand times!"

Graduate students Ye Changlin from the History Department, Sun Yuecai from the Philosophy Department, and Xu Shu'an from the Chinese Department, through their own experiences, denounced the old liberal arts graduate system, which is an unreasonable system that guides students to detach from class struggle and reality, and urgently needs thorough reform.

　　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，砸碎旧的教育制度
　　学制必须缩短　教学内容必须改革
　　北大革命师生坚决支持人民大学七同学的建议信
    本报讯　北京大学的革命师生热烈地响应和支持中国人民大学七位同学关于改革文科大学学制给党中央和毛主席的建议信。部分班级的学生和教师代表十二日举行了座谈会，控诉旧的学制和教育制度阻碍青年走上革命化的道路。
    十二日晨，当同学们从《人民日报》上看到人民大学七位同学的建议信以后，立即贴出大字报，有的还写了祝贺信，表示坚决的响应和支持。同学们认为，这个建议是向旧的教育制度的控诉书，是同旧的教育制度彻底决裂的挑战书，也是为创造无产阶级新的教育制度的宣言书。许多革命师生在座谈会上表示，人民大学同学的建议说出了他们的心里话，代表了同学们的共同愿望和要求。他们一定高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，砸碎一切旧的教育制度，建立一个崭新的社会主义的教育制度。
    法律系三年级学生艾才国在座谈会上说，人民大学七位同学的信，说出了我们的心里话。我们请求党中央和毛主席批准我们提前毕业，让我们到三大革命运动中去改造自己，为中国和全世界劳动人民的解放事业贡献一切力量。他说，我是贫农的儿子。一九六三年，我带着贫下中农的殷切希望考进北京大学，希望成为一个无产阶级革命事业的接班人。可是，北大当时不是劳动人民的学校。陆平黑帮顽固地推行修正主义教育路线，要把我们培养成资产阶级修正主义的接班人。我们贫下中农子弟对毛泽东思想无限热爱，认为法律系应该把毛主席著作当作必修课。要到三大革命运动中去，同工农兵结合，以阶级斗争为主课。可是，陆平黑帮想方设法阻止我们学习毛主席著作，反对我们同工农兵结合。他们以培养法律专门人材为借口，单纯强调书本知识，引导学生脱离政治，钻到古书中去。有的同学受了毒害，滑到修正主义的边缘；有的工农家庭出身的同学读书几年，连工农阶级感情也淡漠了。
    哲学系五年级学生孙永庆说，在北大念了五年书，使我深深感到旧的教育制度是培养修正主义接班人的工具，过去的北大是个修正主义的大染缸。我们要求彻底粉碎旧的教育制度，把北大的文化大革命进行到底，彻底反掉修正主义。他说，陆平黑帮要我们到古人、死人堆里找“辩证法”，拜倒在孔子的脚下，却不让我们学习毛主席著作。给我们讲课的一些黑帮分子和修正主义分子在课堂上大肆放毒，攻击毛泽东思想和三面红旗，反对理论联系实际。毛主席的四篇哲学论文，他们始终没有认真讲过，却大肆宣传《燕山夜话》等毒草。他说，我非常同意中国人民大学七位同学的建议。我即将毕业，我向党和毛主席保证，现在坚决投入无产阶级文化大革命中去，向黑帮开火，彻底肃清他们的影响。我坚决要求把我分配到最艰苦、最需要的地方去，到边疆、农村、基层去，到工农兵群众中去，为中国革命和世界革命贡献自己的一生。
    图书馆学系的王心田、国际政治系的任雅芳、中文系的李祚荣等同学，在发言中都强烈地控诉旧教育制度对他们的毒害。王心田说，图书馆学系本来是二年制，以后改为三年制、四年制，一九六四年起还招了研究生。系里原来的反党反社会主义黑帮分子公开告诉学生：你们毕业以后，都留在大城市图书馆当研究人员和管理人员，不必到农村去。他甚至说：“你们就是为少数（资产阶级）专家服务的。”这是多么危险，又是多么狠毒的毒害学生的手段呵！我们坚决要求打烂旧的教育制度，坚决到工农兵群众中去。李祚荣说，在陆平黑帮控制下的旧北大，处处阻止我们学习毛主席著作，阻止我们和工农兵结合。他们讲课，开口普列汉诺夫，闭口别林斯基，就是企图用古的、洋的东西封我们的嘴，用资产阶级思想把我们的无产阶级思想溶化掉。任雅芳说，要打碎旧教育制度，首先要把学校领导权从资产阶级反党反社会主义黑帮手中夺过来，要向一切资产阶级“权威”“专家”开火，才能树立起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，建设起真正的社会主义新北大。
    生物系四年级学生陈鸿奎说，中国人民大学七位同学所提出的现行学制的十大罪状，不仅文科存在；理科也存在；我们也倡议：理科的学制必须改革。
    中文系教师杨富新说，人民大学七同学提出了我们过去想到而没有敢提出的愿望。目前大学学制一般五年，研究生三年到四年，仅在北大读书就要九年，而九年革命斗争能锻炼出多少革命接班人呵！更严重的是旧大学不仅学制长，教学内容脱离实际，培养出来的学生不是工农感情增加了，而是愈学愈蠢，愈不愿意到工农群众中去，到基层单位去为人民服务了。学制一定要缩短，教学内容一定要改革。旧教育制度不彻底粉碎，就不能挖掉修正主义的根子。他说，我对中国人民大学七位同学的建议，一千个支持，一万个支持！
    历史系研究生叶昌纲、哲学系研究生孙月才和中文系研究生许树安等人在发言中，通过他们自己的切身体验，控诉旧的文科研究生制度，是引导学生脱离阶级斗争、脱离实际的不合理的制度，也迫切需要进行彻底改革。
