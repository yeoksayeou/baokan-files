	The Liberation Armed Forces Headquarters of South Vietnam condemns the U.S. imperialist bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong
	Tenfold punishment for the U.S. imperialists to achieve greater victories
	The Hanoi Municipal Committee calls on the military and civilians to fight tenaciously and resolutely defend the capital

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 2 – According to a report from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces Headquarters of South Vietnam sent a telegram to the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army on June 30, expressing great indignation at the U.S. aggressor planes attacking Hanoi and Haiphong, and stating that the military and civilians in the South are determined to fight harder and more accurately, severely punish the U.S. aggressors, and avenge the compatriots in the North and South.

	The telegram pointed out that the Washington authorities' mad, bandit-like actions are a new and extremely serious step in the "escalation" of the war, a provocation to the determination of the entire Vietnamese people to defeat the U.S. aggressors. This action exposes the weakness and passive situation of the U.S. aggressors, and it cannot make the Vietnamese people retreat in their just cause.

	The telegram pointed out that even if the sky falls and the earth crumbles, it cannot shake the iron will of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam to decisively defeat the U.S. aggressors. For every crime the U.S. aggressors commit against the Vietnamese people, the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam will resolutely punish them fivefold, tenfold. The Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam are determined to fight fiercely, accurately, and continuously, to fight on the supply lines, in the enemy's lairs, to annihilate more U.S. and puppet troops, and to achieve more and greater victories.

	On the same day, the Saigon-Gia Dinh Region National Liberation Front Committee and the Liberation Armed Forces Headquarters also sent a telegram to the military and civilians of Hanoi, saying that the "escalation" of the war by the U.S. aggressors and their puppet clique is a stupid move by the U.S. aggressors. The Vietnamese people are even more outraged by the new crimes of the U.S. aggressors and are determined to advance bravely and annihilate them!

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 2 – The Hanoi Municipal Committee of the Vietnamese Workers' Party and the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee called on the entire city's military and civilians to remain vigilant, fight tenaciously, and resolutely defend the capital.

	This call was made in an open letter to the Hanoi People's Armed Forces.

	The letter warmly praised the heroic and tenacious fighting of the military and civilians of Hanoi on June 29 and 30, shooting down six U.S. planes and capturing a batch of U.S. pilots, achieving a glorious victory.

	The letter said that this glorious achievement shows the capital's military and civilians' deep hatred for the enemy and their spirit of decisive victory. This glorious achievement also demonstrates the capital's military and civilians' determination to defend their beloved capital and resolutely drive out the U.S. aggressors together with the people of the entire country. This achievement is a stern warning to the U.S. aggressors: all their evil and despicable actions will be severely punished. The letter said that the U.S. aggressors are very stubborn and have many more vicious and despicable actions. They are suffering a miserable defeat in the South. To save the situation, they are continuing down the path of "escalating" destruction in the North and against our capital.

	The letter called on the capital's military and civilians to further heighten their vigilance, deepen their hatred for the U.S. aggressors, continuously enhance their heroic and tenacious fighting spirit, continue to strengthen tactical and technical training, be ready for battle at any time, shoot down more U.S. aggressor planes, and defend the beloved capital.

	In his speech to the military and civilians of Hanoi, Chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee, Tran Van Hien, called on the military and civilians of Hanoi to harbor deep hatred for the U.S. aggressors, further heighten their vigilance, and be ready for battle at any time. To defend the beloved capital, to defend the lives of the people, and to defend all the fruits of socialist construction in the capital, the capital's military and civilians must grasp their guns firmly, timely summarize combat experience, and accurately shoot down more U.S. aggressor planes.
