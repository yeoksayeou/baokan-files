Mountain city Guiyang's people of all ethnic groups, totaling 200,000, held a grand rally and demonstration on the 23rd, resolving to spare no effort to support Vietnamese brothers in thoroughly driving out the U.S. aggressors from Vietnam.

The first secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Jia Qiyuan, and other leaders of the province, city, and military, including Wu Su, Miao Chunting, Chen Luoru, Xu Jiangsheng, Zhang Yiqiao, Zhang Jianmin, Wu Shi, Dai Xiaodong, He Guangyu, and Cheng Ke, as well as leaders of various people's organizations and democratic parties in the province and city, attended the meeting.

Zhang Yiqiao, secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and first secretary of the Guiyang Municipal Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao said: 'Create trouble, fail, create trouble again, fail again... until they are utterly destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when they deal with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic.' In the face of the heroic Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world, the U.S. aggressors will get nothing; what they get is their own grave!"

Li Mingyuan, representative of various people's organizations and democratic parties in Guizhou Province and Guiyang City, and Wang Zhiguo, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in Guiyang City, also spoke at the meeting. They expressed the determination of the people of the entire province to resolutely support the Vietnamese people.

After the meeting, a massive demonstration march was held.
