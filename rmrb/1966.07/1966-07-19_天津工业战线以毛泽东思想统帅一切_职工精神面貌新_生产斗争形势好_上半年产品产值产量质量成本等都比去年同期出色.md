Tianjin's industrial sector has been led by Mao Zedong Thought in all aspects. Workers' spiritual outlook has improved, and the production situation is good. In the first half of the year, product value, output, quality, and cost have all outperformed the same period last year.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 18th: Tianjin's industrial sector has seen a great revolutionary situation in the first half of this year. This great situation once again proves that emphasizing proletarian politics, emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought, taking class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key, infusing Mao Zedong Thought into the workers, and using Mao Zedong Thought to lead everything, promotes the revolutionization of people's thoughts and enterprises, is the fundamental guarantee for achieving all victories.

Statistics show that from January to June this year, the city's total industrial output value has already completed more than half of the annual plan, showing a significant increase compared to the same period last year. The output of agricultural machinery, some important raw materials, and key products urgently needed by the state has all increased significantly compared to the same period last year. The quality of most major products has either improved or remained stable. The city's industrial production costs have been reduced, profits turned in have increased, and labor productivity has also shown a significant increase compared to the same period last year.

Since the beginning of this year, Tianjin's industrial system has taken class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key, and conducted a four-month discussion on emphasizing politics. In the discussion on emphasizing politics and the subsequent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they used Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to criticize various bourgeois ideas and revisionist views such as "profit-oriented," "index-oriented," "task-oriented," and "bonus-oriented"; they criticized the capitalist line of running enterprises with "management" as the key, relying on a few people, and relying on bourgeois "experts" to run enterprises in a cold and desolate manner. Through this great discussion and criticism, the broad masses of workers have strengthened their class consciousness and awareness of class struggle, further understood Chairman Mao's teachings that politics is the commander, the soul, and that politics is the struggle between classes; they have realized the importance of running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, and firmly grasping class struggle, the struggle between the two lines, and the struggle in the ideological realm to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie, thereby greatly enhancing the revolutionary consciousness of the workers.

The Tianjin Clock and Watch Factory had many problems in political work, enterprise management, and production technology in the past because it did not emphasize proletarian politics, and these problems have not been well resolved. The factory has been in a state of backward production. In the first half of this year, the broad masses of workers firmly grasped the key of class struggle, followed Chairman Mao's teachings, and conducted a struggle against various capitalist management views and wrong thoughts in the enterprise. Through the struggle, they expanded the revolutionary workforce armed with Mao Zedong Thought, clarified the political direction of running the enterprise according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and the factory's appearance has been renewed. The three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment have all achieved good results.

The broad masses of workers in Tianjin have deeply felt from revolutionary practice that the working class must be the master of the enterprise. Not only must they charge into the front lines of production, but more importantly, in the socialist revolution, they must dare to be critics of the old world, fight against all non-proletarian thoughts, break the monopoly of bourgeois thoughts and technical "authorities" over the enterprise, grasp the leadership of technology, and consolidate the proletarian position in socialist enterprises. In the discussion on emphasizing politics and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers have held this belief, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, used big-character posters, criticism meetings, and other forms to thoroughly criticize bourgeois technical "authorities," sweep away all ghosts and monsters, temper and expand the revolutionary ranks, consolidate the leadership of the working class, and make the wisdom and high revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers fully manifest under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought. In the first half of this year, the city's mass technical innovation activities have been carried out in depth and solidly, achieving more than nineteen thousand innovation projects, most of which are of relatively high level.

The broad masses of workers in Tianjin have further realized in the three great revolutionary movements that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest and most active Marxism-Leninism of our time, is the sharpest weapon for carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, and is the source of all power. With Mao Zedong Thought in mind, there is a clear political direction; with Mao Zedong Thought guiding practice, there is no failure. Therefore, the broad masses of workers have unlimited love, faith, and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought, further raising the consciousness of reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, powerfully promoting the mass movement of learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. Many industrial departments and factories have held study classes, training classes, and political schools for Chairman Mao's works; they have promoted the experience of the People's Liberation Army in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, held lectures, study sessions, story sessions, and established slogan boards, infusing Mao Zedong Thought into the broad masses of workers, turning factories and enterprises into large schools of Mao Zedong Thought, and into furnaces for tempering and training the proletarian revolutionary industrial army.

In the situation of a great revolutionary situation in the first half of the year, the broad masses of workers in Tianjin use Chairman Mao's teachings of the "two combined into one" viewpoint, affirming achievements while setting higher standards for themselves, comparing with the advanced and finding gaps. They are determined to continue to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, ride the east wind of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, deeply study Chairman Mao's works, deeply study the letter written by Comrade Lin Biao on the industrial and transportation lines actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, firmly grasp class struggle, emphasize politics, and resolutely run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan.

　　天津工业战线以毛泽东思想统帅一切
　　职工精神面貌新　生产斗争形势好
　　上半年产品产值产量质量成本等都比去年同期出色
    据新华社天津十八日电　天津市工业战线今年上半年出现了一片大好革命形势。这个大好形势的出现，再一次雄辩地证明：突出无产阶级政治，突出毛泽东思想，以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，把毛泽东思想灌输到工人中去，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，促进人的思想革命化和企业革命化，是取得一切胜利的根本保证。
    据统计，今年一至六月，全市工业总产值已经完成全年计划的一半以上，比去年同期有较大幅度的增长。农业机械、一些重要原材料和国家急需的重要产品的产量，都比去年同期有较多的增长。绝大部分主要产品的质量，有的比去年进一步提高，有的保持稳定。全市工业生产成本降低，上缴利润增加，劳动生产率也比去年同期有较大幅度的增长。
    从今年年初开始，天津市工业系统以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，开展了四个多月的突出政治大讨论。在突出政治的大讨论和相继开展的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们以毛泽东思想为锐利武器，批判了“利润挂帅”、“指标挂帅”、“任务挂帅”、“奖金挂帅”等形形色色的资产阶级思想和修正主义观点以及“突出政治要落实在业务上”等错误观点；批判了在企业中“管”字当头，依靠少数人，依靠资产阶级“专家”冷冷清清地办企业的资本主义路线。通过这场大讨论、大批判，广大职工群众增强了阶级和阶级斗争的观念，进一步领会了毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治是阶级对阶级的斗争的教导；明确了要按照毛泽东思想办企业，必须突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争、两条道路斗争和意识形态方面兴无灭资斗争的重要意义，从而大大增强了职工群众的革命自觉性。
    天津钟表厂过去因为没有突出无产阶级政治，在政治工作、企业管理工作、生产技术工作等方面遗留下来许多问题，一直没有得到很好解决，生产落后状态一直没有很好改变。今年上半年，广大职工群众紧紧抓住阶级斗争这个纲，按照毛主席的教导，对企业里形形色色的资本主义经营观点和错误思想，进行了针锋相对的斗争。通过斗争，壮大了用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命的职工队伍，明确了遵照毛主席的指示办企业的政治方向，工厂面貌焕然一新，阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动，都取得了很好的成绩。
    天津市广大职工从革命实践中深深体会到，工人阶级要做企业的主人，不光要在生产上冲锋陷阵，更重要的是在社会主义革命中，敢于做旧世界的批判者，向一切非无产阶级思想作斗争，打破资产阶级思想和技术“权威”对企业的垄断，掌握技术的领导权，巩固社会主义企业的无产阶级阵地。在突出政治大讨论和无产阶级文化大革命中，广大的工人群众就是抱着这个信念，活学活用毛主席著作，用大字报、批判会等形式，大破资产阶级技术“权威”，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，锻炼壮大了革命队伍，巩固了工人阶级的领导地位，使广大职工的聪明才智和高涨的革命热情，在毛泽东思想阳光的照耀下充分发挥了出来。今年上半年，全市群众性的技术革新活动开展得深入扎实，实现了一万九千多项革新项目，其中大部分是水平比较高的项目。
    天津市广大职工在三大革命运动中，进一步认识到，毛泽东思想是当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设最锐利的武器，是一切力量的源泉。头脑里有了毛泽东思想，就有了明确的政治方向；用毛泽东思想指导实践，就无往而不胜。因而，广大工人对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，进一步提高了读毛主席的书、听毛主席的话、照毛主席的指示办事的自觉性，有力地推动了群众性的活学活用毛主席著作的运动。许多工业部门和工厂企业，举办了毛主席著作学习班、训练班、政治学校；推广解放军活学活用毛主席著作的经验，举办了讲用会、学用会、故事会，建立了语录牌，把毛泽东思想灌输到广大工人群众中去，把工厂企业办成毛泽东思想的大学校，办成培养和锻炼无产阶级的革命化的产业大军的熔炉。
    在上半年出现一片大好形势的情况下，天津市的广大职工运用毛主席教导的“一分为二”观点，既肯定成绩，更以高标准要求自己，比先进、找差距。他们决心继续更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘无产阶级文化大革命的东风，大学毛主席著作，深入学习林彪同志就工业交通战线活学活用毛主席著作写的一封信，狠抓阶级斗争，大力突出政治，坚决按照毛泽东思想办企业，夺取第三个五年计划第一年的全面胜利。
