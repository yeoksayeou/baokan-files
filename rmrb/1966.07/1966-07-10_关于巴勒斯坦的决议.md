Edition: 7

The Asian-African Writers' Conference firmly believes that people have the right to freedom, independence, and self-determination. We are committed to the revolutionary principles of this conference, which state that the peoples of all countries share a common goal and fate in their struggle against colonialism and imperialism. Therefore,

1. The conference holds that Zionism, in its essence and origin, is a colonialist movement, aggressive in its objectives, racist in its structure, and fascist in its methods and tactics.

2. The conference believes that the so-called Israel is a colonialist base and a tool of colonialism. Colonialism uses it to achieve its goals of economic, political, and cultural penetration and aggression in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The conference also believes that Israel is a tool threatening world peace and stability and an obstacle to the progress and development of this region.

3. The conference condemns the Zionist movement and Israel's occupation of Palestine.

4. The conference holds that the Palestinian Arab people have the right to liberate their homeland, which is a continuation of their legitimate right to self-defense and self-determination.

5. The conference demands the severance of all political relations with Israel, the economic and cultural boycott of Israel, and its expulsion from international organizations. The conference especially urges all revolutionary writers, progressive parties, and progressive organizations to redouble their efforts to resist Zionist infiltration into their countries and to work for the abrogation of agreements signed between Israel and their countries.

6. The conference condemns the conspiracy of the United States, Britain, and West Germany in aiding, protecting, and providing weapons to Israel for the aggression against the Arab people, the deprivation of their freedom, and the obstruction of the unification of their countries.

7. The conference strongly condemns the large-scale immigration to the occupied Palestine. This immigration activity is organized by colonialism and Zionism to consolidate Zionist occupation of Palestine and achieve its aggressive goals.

8. The conference must be vigilant against the so-called technical and economic aid provided by Israel, which is a replica of the aid from American imperialism and neo-colonialism.

9. The conference calls on all patriotic organizations and liberated countries to provide material and financial assistance to the Palestinian struggle against Zionism and colonialism.

10. The conference demands the complete elimination of the colonialist entity Israel, which is completely dependent on world imperialism.

11. The conference strongly condemns Israel's provision of strategic aid to certain puppet governments in Africa, aiming to suppress the liberation movements in those countries, primarily in Congo (Leopoldville).

12. The conference supports the struggle of the Palestine Liberation Organization for the liberation of Palestine.

    关于巴勒斯坦的决议
    我们亚非作家坚信人民应享有自由和独立的权利和享有自决的权利，我们忠于这次会议的革命原则，即各国人民在反对殖民主义和帝国主义的共同斗争中目标一致，命运一致的原则；因此
    1．会议认为，犹太复国主义就其本质和根源来说是一种殖民主义运动，就其目的来说是侵略性的，就其结构来说是种族主义的，就其方式和手法来说是法西斯主义的。
    2．会议认为，所谓的以色列是一个殖民主义的基地，是殖民主义手中驯服的工具。殖民主义利用它来实现其在亚非拉三洲进行经济、政治和文化的殖民主义渗透和侵略的目的。会议同样认为，以色列是威胁世界和平安宁的工具，是妨碍这一地区进步和发展的因素。
    3．会议谴责犹太复国主义运动，谴责以色列对巴勒斯坦的侵占。
    4．会议认为，巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民有解放祖国的权利，这是他们自卫和自决的正当权利的继续。
    5．会议要求同以色列断绝一切政治关系，要求从经济和文化上抵制以色列，并将它从国际组织中赶出去。会议特别要求所有革命作家、进步政党和进步团体加倍努力反对犹太复国主义向他们国家的渗透、争取废除以色列和他们国家所签定的协定。
    6．会议谴责美国、英国和西德为侵略阿拉伯人民、剥夺他们的自由和阻止他们国家的统一而对以色列进行援助、保护和提供杀人武器的阴谋。
    7．会议强烈谴责向被侵占的巴勒斯坦进行大批移民。这种移民活动是殖民主义和犹太复国主义为了巩固犹太复国主义对巴勒斯坦的侵占和实现其侵略目的而组织的。
    8．会议必须警惕以色列提供的所谓技术和经济援助是美帝国主义和新殖民主义援助的翻版。
    9．会议呼吁所有的爱国团体组织和解放了的国家向巴勒斯坦反对犹太复国主义和殖民主义的斗争提供物质上和财政上的援助。
    10．会议要求彻底消灭完全依附于世界帝国主义的殖民主义实体以色列。
    11．会议强烈谴责以色列向某些非洲傀儡政府提供战略援助，这种援助的目的是镇压那些国家、首先是镇压刚果（利）的解放运动。
    12．会议支持巴勒斯坦解放组织为解放巴勒斯坦所进行的斗争。
