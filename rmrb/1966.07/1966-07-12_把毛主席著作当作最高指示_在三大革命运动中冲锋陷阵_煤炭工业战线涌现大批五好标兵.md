The nationwide movement to learn from Daqing and create five-good units, launched by the million coal miners of our country, has already borne rich fruits. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, a proletarianized, revolutionized, and combat-ready army of coal miners is growing, and grassroots work is being continuously strengthened.

In the country, just among the large and medium-sized coal mines, more than 5,000 five-good teams have emerged, with good political and ideological work, good completion of plans, good three-eight work style, good production management, and good living management. There are more than 58,000 five-good workers who are good in political and ideological work, good in completing tasks, good in observing discipline, good in continuous learning, and good in unity and mutual aid. There are more than 700 five-good mining teams, five-good tunneling teams, five-good workshops, and five-good drilling rigs, etc. Recently, the Ministry of Coal Industry held a national conference in Beijing for the representatives of the five-good collectives and five-good workers in the coal industry, summarizing the experience of carrying out the five-good movement. At the meeting, 35 advanced collectives and 29 advanced individuals were selected as the national five-good exemplars in the coal industry.

The five-good exemplars selected at this conference are all advanced collectives and activists who study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice. They use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, regarding Chairman Mao's works as the highest directive, charging forward, overcoming difficulties, and excellently completing various tasks.

The Jiaozuo Coal Mine's 54th Youth Mining Team, the Xinqiu East Open-Pit Mine, the Jiaohe Coal Mine's 302 Mining Team, the Zibo Hongshan Coal Mine's 54th Mining Team, the Shiqian Coal Mine's 501 Mining Team, the Shuangyashan Coal Mine's Red Rocket Tunneling Team, the Ninth Engineering Division's First Tunneling Team, and the First Engineering Division's First Tunneling Team, etc., are all heroic teams on the front line of coal production and construction in our country who dare to think, dare to do, dare to fight, dare to struggle, dare to pioneer, and dare to innovate. They have been fighting year-round in pits hundreds of meters deep, going where it is most arduous, and creating outstanding achievements. They never become arrogant in the face of success, often using the two-line struggle as a weapon, continuously revolutionizing, and continuously advancing.

The Jixi 802 Drilling Rig in the mountains and the 507 Drilling Rig of the Helan Mountain Coal Industry Company are also five-good geological vanguards who endure hardships and toil for the revolution to find treasures. Over the years, the workers operating these drilling rigs have traversed mountains and rivers, endured hardships, and overcome numerous difficulties, revealing a large amount of coal resources for the state and making significant contributions to coal mine construction.

In the coal mine design departments, auxiliary production units, service departments, and among the workers' families, many five-good units have also emerged. Some of them, with a high spirit of revolution, have gone down to the workshops and out to the sites, combining with the workers, and opening up new paths for coal mine design in our country; some have displayed a high spirit of communism, doing everything possible to serve production and the people, becoming reliable logistics personnel in production and construction; some have transformed from consumers to producers, embarking on the road of laborization and collectivization.

The national five-good workers selected this time are all good examples of firm political and ideological beliefs. Among them, Feng Yuping, who sacrificed herself to save state property and then, with indomitable will, overcame various difficulties caused by her physical disability and returned to work, is known as the good daughter of the working class; Yu Kedong, a teacher at the Huainan Xiejiaji No. 2 Mine Workers' Night School, who is disabled but has a red heart and serves the people wholeheartedly; Du Qingrong, the technical innovation pioneer and drill rig operator of the Heilongjiang Coalfield's 110th Geological Team; Zheng Chengfang, a red miner from the Tianfu Coal Mine in Sichuan, who has always been willing to take on heavy responsibilities, is diligent and thrifty, and selfless; Zhang Qingrui, a coal miner from Henggang Coal Mine, who works hard for the revolution, is selfless, and helps others; and so on. They are all models of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice, reading Chairman Mao's books with strong class feelings, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's directives. Therefore, they have become a new generation of coal miners in our country who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

The five-good movement in the national coal industry began in early 1964 after learning from the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army. Practice has proven that vigorously carrying out the five-good movement in enterprises is an important measure to strengthen grassroots construction, implement the four firsts, and cultivate a highly proletarianized, highly revolutionary, and highly combat-ready industrial army. It can not only strengthen the Party's leadership over grassroots work but also maximize the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, laying a good foundation for creating more Daqing-style enterprises.

The practice of the past two years has proven that to carry out this movement well within the enterprise, one must first emphasize politics, insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, and insist on taking class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key. The five-good movement requires all five aspects to be good, but political and ideological excellence is the decisive factor. Only when people's thinking is revolutionized and there is a correct and firm political direction can the other four goods be brought out. Currently, the vast majority of the five-good workers and five-good collectives that have emerged in the national coal mines are "experts" in studying Chairman Mao's works. They have deeply felt from their own experiences: "Chairman Mao's books are the books of the laboring people for revolution, Chairman Mao's words are the most effective words, one sentence is worth ten thousand sentences. Chairman Mao's theories are the greatest theories in the world; to thoroughly overthrow the old world and build a new society, one must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice." Therefore, they have an infinite love for Chairman Mao's works, study them with the greatest perseverance, and achieve the goal of not being hindered by busy work or low culture.

The development of the five-good movement has also further promoted the revolutionization of grassroots Party organizations, Youth League organizations, and trade union organizations, bringing all major grassroots work to a new level. Many of the five-good grassroots units selected this time generally have a relatively strong and revolutionized leadership team. The Party branch secretaries, team leaders (workshop directors), and branch committee members are mostly exemplars and models of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice. They lead by example, strictly demand of themselves, and with their exemplary actions, inspire, influence, and educate the masses, becoming the confidants and good examples of the masses. Around the leadership core, a large number of activists have been united, who are not only the backbone of production but also the backbone of political and ideological work. They often use forms such as mutual heart-to-heart talks and home visits to grasp the dynamic thoughts of the workers at any time and help them solve ideological problems, making political work permeate all aspects. Therefore, in units where the five-good movement has been carried out relatively well, the political atmosphere is always thick, good deeds are numerous, and a new situation of praising good deeds, criticizing bad deeds, pointing out shortcomings and errors, and helping in times of difficulty has emerged everywhere.

The First Engineering Division of the Ministry of Coal Industry's Rock Tunneling Team has significantly increased the rock tunneling speed by using multiple wind drills in a large cross-section tunnel.

### 把毛主席著作当作最高指示　在三大革命运动中冲锋陷阵  煤炭工业战线涌现大批五好标兵

    把毛主席著作当作最高指示　在三大革命运动中冲锋陷阵
    煤炭工业战线涌现大批五好标兵
    新华社十一日讯　我国百万煤矿工人开展的学大庆、创五好的比学赶帮超运动，已经结出了丰硕的果实。在毛泽东思想哺育下，一支无产阶级化、革命化、战斗化的煤矿产业大军正在成长，基层工作也在不断加强。
    全国单是大中型煤矿，就已经涌现出五千多个政治思想好、完成计划好、三八作风好、生产管理好、生活管理好的五好班组，五万八千多名政治思想好、完成任务好、遵守纪律好、经常学习好、团结互助好的五好职工，七百多个五好采煤队、五好掘进队、五好车间和五好钻机等。最近，煤炭工业部在北京召开了全国煤炭工业五好集体和五好职工代表会议，总结了开展五好运动的经验。会上，评选出了三十五个先进集体和二十九名先进人物，作为全国煤炭工业的五好标兵。
    这次会议评选出的五好标兵，都是活学活用毛泽东思想的先进集体和积极分子。他们在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，以毛泽东思想为武器，把毛主席著作当作最高指示，冲锋陷阵，克服困难，出色地完成了各项任务。
    被评选为全国五好集体标兵的焦作煤矿五四青年采煤队，新丘东露天矿，蛟河煤矿三○二采煤队，淄博洪山煤矿五四采煤队，石圪节煤矿五○一采矿队，双鸭山煤矿红火箭掘进队，第九工程处第一掘进队，第一工程处第一掘进队等，都是我国煤矿生产建设战线上敢想、敢干、敢斗、敢拚、敢闯、敢创的英雄队。他们常年战斗在几百米深的井下，哪里最艰苦，就到哪里去，创造了优异的成绩。他们在成绩面前从不骄傲，经常以两分法为武器，不断革命，不断前进。
    战斗在丛山峻岭中的鸡西八○二钻机，贺兰山煤炭工业公司的五○七钻机等，也都是吃大苦、耐大劳，一心一意为革命找宝藏的五好地质尖兵。几年来，开动这些钻机的职工跋山涉水、餐风饮露，战胜了重重困难，为国家查明了大量的煤炭资源，对煤矿建设作出了重大贡献。
    在煤矿设计部门，辅助生产单位，服务部门和职工家属中，也出现了许多五好集体单位。他们中有的以高度的革命精神，下楼出院，深入实际，深入现场，同工人结合，为我国煤矿设计开辟了新道路；有的发扬了高度的共产主义风格，千方百计为生产服务，为群众服务，成了生产建设上的得力后勤兵；有的由消费者变成了生产者，走上了劳动化、集体化的道路。
    这次评选出的全国五好职工，都是政治思想过硬的好榜样，其中有舍身抢救国家财产，以后又以顽强意志战胜了身体残废造成的各种困难，重新走上工作岗位的被誉为工人阶级的好女儿的冯玉萍；有身残心红，全心全意为人民服务的淮南谢家集二矿职工业余学校教师于克东；有技术革新闯将黑龙江煤田一一○地质队八号钻机机长杜青荣；有一贯勇于肩挑重担，克勤克俭，舍己为公的四川天府煤矿红色矿工郑成方；有为革命任劳任怨，一心为公、助人为乐的鹤岗煤矿采煤工张清瑞；等等。他们都是活学活用毛主席著作的模范，带着强烈的阶级感情读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，因而成为我国煤矿工人中用毛泽东思想武装起来的一代新人。
    全国煤炭工业的五好运动，是从一九六四年初学习解放军政治工作经验以后开展起来的。实践证明，在企业中大力开展五好运动，是加强基层建设，落实四个第一，培养出一支非常无产阶级化、非常革命化和非常战斗化的产业大军的重要措施。它既能加强党对基层工作的领导，又能最大限度地调动职工群众的积极性和创造性，为创造更多的大庆式企业奠定良好的基础。
    两年来的实践证明，在企业内要搞好这一运动，首先必须突出政治，坚持用毛泽东思想统帅一切，坚持以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，三大革命运动一起抓。五好运动要求五个方面都要好，但是政治思想好是决定性的因素，因为只有人的思想革命化了，有了正确坚定的政治方向，才能带出其他四好。目前全国煤矿中涌现出来的五好职工和五好集体，绝大部分是学习毛主席著作的“尖子”。他们从自己亲身经历中深刻体会到：“毛主席的书，是劳动人民闹革命的书，毛主席的话，是最灵的话，一句顶一万句。毛主席的学说，是世界上最伟大的学说；要彻底推翻旧世界，建设新社会，非活学活用毛主席著作不可。”因此，他们对毛主席著作无限热爱，学起来有最大的毅力，作到工作忙挤不掉，文化低难不倒。
    五好运动的开展，也进一步促进了基层党组织、团组织和工会组织的革命化，把基层的各项主要工作全面带动了起来。这次评选出来的许多五好基层单位，一般都有一个比较坚强的革命化的领导班子。支部书记、队长（车间主任）和支部委员，绝大部分是活学活用毛主席著作的标兵和模范。他们处处以身作则，严格要求自己，而且以自己的模范行动，带动群众，影响群众，教育群众，成为群众的贴心人和好榜样。在领导核心的周围，还团结了一大批积极分子，他们既是生产中的骨干，也是政治思想工作的骨干，经常通过互相谈心、家庭访问等形式，随时随地抓好职工中的活思想，帮助他们解决思想问题，使政治工作渗透到各个方面。因此，凡是五好运动开展得比较好的单位，政治空气始终是浓浓的，好人好事也是多多的，而且到处出现了好人好事有人夸，坏人坏事有人抓，缺点错误有人提，有了困难有人帮的新气象。（附图片）
