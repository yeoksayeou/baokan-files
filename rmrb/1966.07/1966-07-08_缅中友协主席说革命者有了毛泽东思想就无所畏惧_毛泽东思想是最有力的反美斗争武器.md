Chairman of the Myanmar-China Friendship Association Says Revolutionaries with Mao Zedong Thought Fear Nothing

Mao Zedong Thought is the Most Powerful Weapon Against American Imperialism

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Rangoon on the 7th, the Chairman of the Myanmar-China Friendship Association, Thakin Tin, recently received a New China News Agency reporter in Rangoon and said: "At present, under the guidance of the thought of Chairman Mao Zedong, the strength of the 700 million Chinese people is growing stronger and stronger. The Chinese people, who have grasped Chairman Mao's great revolutionary philosophy, are invincible. No force in the world can defeat them."

Thakin Tin said: "Just as the great revolutionary leadership of Lenin led the Soviet people to break free from the capitalist exploitation of Russia, Chairman Mao's revolutionary leadership has also led the Chinese people to liberation in China."

He said: "Chairman Mao's thoughts on class struggle and proletarian dictatorship in the contemporary world are becoming the most important guiding principles for the contemporary struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, and for carrying the proletarian revolution through to the end."

He said: "Chairman Mao's strategic thought on American imperialism being a 'paper tiger' and the thought of people's war are the most powerful and extremely valuable weapons in the contemporary struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs."

He said: "The modern revisionists led by Khrushchev and the current Soviet leadership oppose this thought. In fact, they know very well that this great thought is the most formidable weapon against imperialism and reactionaries. But they still oppose it! Why? Because they oppose all people's liberation movements and shamelessly collude with American imperialism and its running dogs in various places in broad daylight. Modern revisionists have degenerated into traitors of Marxism-Leninism!"

Thakin Tin said: "We are very pleased that the teachings of Chairman Mao are spreading to various countries and peoples. All the oppressed peoples of the world can become revolutionaries by using Chairman Mao's principles as their guide, and they can fear nothing, be organized, and be thorough in their revolutionary activities. They will definitely be able to defeat the dark forces of imperialism and reactionaries."

He finally expressed: "People all over the world are increasingly recognizing that 'Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought' is the most sacred doctrine in the world for seeking human progress and liberation."

    缅中友协主席说革命者有了毛泽东思想就无所畏惧
    毛泽东思想是最有力的反美斗争武器
    据新华社仰光七日电　缅中友好协会主席信波最近在仰光接见新华社记者时说：“目前，在毛泽东主席思想指引下的七亿中国人民的力量日益强大。掌握了毛主席的伟大革命哲学的中国人民是无敌的，世界上没有任何力量能够打败他们。”
    信波说：“象伟大的革命的列宁的领导使苏联人民摆脱了俄国的资本主义剥削一样，毛主席的革命的领导也使中国人民在中国获得了解放。”
    他说：“毛主席关于当代的阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的思想，正在成为当代反对帝国主义和现代修正主义、争取把无产阶级革命进行到底的斗争的最重要的指导原则。”
    他说：“毛主席关于美帝国主义是‘纸老虎’的战略思想和人民战争的思想，是当代反对美帝国主义及其走狗的最有力的和非常宝贵的武器。”
    他说：“以赫鲁晓夫和目前的苏联领导集团为首的现代修正主义者反对这种思想。事实上，他们很清楚，这种伟大的思想是对付帝国主义和反动派的最厉害的武器。但是，他们还是加以反对！为什么？因为他们反对一切人民解放运动，并且在众目睽睽下无耻地同美帝国主义及其在各地的走狗勾结。现代修正主义者已经堕落成为马克思列宁主义的叛徒！”
    信波说：“我们对于毛主席的学说正在传布到各国和各国人民而感到非常高兴。全世界被压迫的人民用毛主席的原理作为他们的指南，就可以成为革命者，他们在革命活动中就可以无所畏惧、有组织和彻底，他们一定能够打败帝国主义和反动派的黑暗势力。”
    他最后表示：“全世界人民日益认识到，‘马克思列宁主义—毛泽东思想’是世界上谋求人类进步和解放的最神圣的学说。”
