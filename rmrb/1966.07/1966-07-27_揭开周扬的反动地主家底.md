Upon hearing the news that Zhou Yang, the leader of the anti-Party, anti-socialist black line in literature and arts, had been exposed, the poor and lower-middle peasants in our Dianzhuang Brigade were overjoyed, clapping their hands and saying, "The Party and Chairman Mao are great and wise. They have truly stood up for us poor and lower-middle peasants, avenged us, and relieved our grievances."

As the saying goes, "What kind of vine produces what kind of grapes, what class speaks what words." Zhou Yang, who stubbornly clung to the bourgeois literary black line of the 1930s and viciously opposed the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought, if we look at his reactionary background, we can understand the source of his reactionary nature.

Zhou Yang is from our Dianzhuang Brigade. His family was a notorious landlord here, sucking the blood and sweat of the poor. With over five hundred mu of paddy fields, they collected a thousand dan of rent from the peasants every year. At that time, his family had only eight people, but they lived in fifty rooms (now only thirty-seven remain), a complete feudal landlord manor.

Before liberation, my father was a tenant of the Zhou family, and my mother was a female worker. Suffering from the exploitation and oppression of the Zhou family, our family had nothing to eat or wear. My father worked from dawn to dusk, toiling in the fields, exchanging his blood and sweat for grain, which was then carted into their granary. We had nothing to eat, so we had to eat chaff and wild vegetables, and go out to work for food. That year, my father was doing carpentry work for them, and when he was carrying a big tree, he was crushed and spat out blood. From then on, he suffered from hemoptysis and died a few years later. My mother worked as a female worker and a wet nurse for the Zhou family for more than ten years. To feed Zhou Yang's sister, my two-year-old sister died of illness at home, and my three-day-old younger brother was also sent away in pain.

Before liberation, I also worked for the Zhou family for four years. For the first two years, I served Zhou Yang's first "wife" (called the second mistress), and for the next two years, I served Zhou Yang's brother, Zhou Guyi. Working for Zhou Guyi, I toiled from morning to night, so tired that my hands and waist ached, but Zhou Guyi didn't care about my life or death, only giving me one meal a day. Even more detestable was Zhou Yang's "wife." This person was extremely cruel in exploiting the poor, and just thinking about it makes my heart filled with hatred. She herself was idle, playing mahjong all day, and ordered me to do all sorts of menial tasks. She was very particular about "sanitation," and the toilet's chamber pot had to be cleaned and wiped once a day. If she found any dirt on the board, she would scold me. What was even more infuriating was cleaning her chamber pot. Her requirements were extremely vicious. The chamber pot had to be scrubbed with ceramic tiles, scrubbed once and flushed once, scrubbed until there was not a trace of feces or urine, and washed until the chamber pot had no smell. I served her family like a cow and horse, but she gave me a thatched hut to live in and a little leftover food to eat. I was sick, cold, and hungry, and she didn't care about the poor's life or death at all.

On the eve of liberation, Zhou Yang, in order to let his feudal landlord family, which sucked the blood of peasants, escape the peasants' struggle, came up with a plan to have his mother and sister sell the paddy fields one after another, and the whole family moved into the office where Zhou Yang worked. During the land reform, his family was unharmed and escaped the peasants' struggle and punishment. Zhou Yang's brother, Zhou Guyi, was a notorious local bully and a reactionary landlord element. In 1950, Zhou Yang brought him out and arranged for him to work in a provincial office. The former pseudo-police chief transformed into a state cadre. After Zhou Guyi "retired" back to Dianzhuang, he lived on his "retirement" pay, eating well every day, enjoying his "old age," and living as well as he did in the past. The poor and lower-middle peasants saw this and were extremely indignant.

Exposing Zhou Yang's reactionary background, it is not difficult to understand why Zhou Yang is so stubbornly opposed to the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. "A wolf is still a wolf." From the exposure of Zhou Yang's evil deeds, it can be seen that although he has been in the revolutionary ranks for decades, his reactionary landlord class stance and nature have not changed at all.

Chairman Mao said: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never resign themselves to their defeat. They will still struggle to the last. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways every day and every hour, trying to restore their rule in China. This is inevitable, beyond doubt, and we must not relax our vigilance." Chairman Mao's words are a mirror that reveals the true form of Zhou Yang, the head of the black gang. Zhou Yang, who is disguised as a Marxist-Leninist, is a filial son and grandson of the dying feudal landlord class, a wolf in sheep's clothing, who dreams of restoring the "paradise" of landlords and capitalists in China.

Zhou Yang, you are like a mad dog biting the sun, not knowing the height of the sky and the depth of the earth. You should open your eyes and see what era this is! Tell you, now it is not the 1930s, but the great era of Mao Zedong. Did you expect that a former maid, who was once exploited by you, would stand up today and fire fiercely at you, the "master"? Warn you, Zhou Yang: your attempt to restore capitalism is just a pipe dream. If you oppose Mao Zedong Thought, we poor and lower-middle peasants will not allow it! We will resolutely read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will take up our hoes and sickles, and fiercely attack the ghosts and monsters like Zhou Yang, defend the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

    揭开周扬的反动地主家底
    湖南益阳县学习毛主席著作积极分子
    新市渡公社田庄大队妇代会主任  盛和秀
    听到周扬这个反党反社会主义的文艺黑线头子被揪了出来的消息，我们田庄大队的贫下中农个个拍手称快，都说：“党和毛主席伟大英明，真是为我们贫下中农撑了腰，出了气，解了恨。”
    俗话说：什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。周扬这样顽固透顶的坚持三十年代资产阶级文艺黑线，恶毒地反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想，如果我们看看周扬反动的家底，就能知道他的反动本性的由来。
    周扬是我们田庄大队的人，他家是我们这里远近闻名的大地主，吸穷人的血，喝穷人的汗，靠着五百多亩水田，每年从农民手里收回一千担租谷。他家那时只有八口人，住的房子却有五十间（现在还剩下三十七间），完完全全是一座封建的地主庄园。
    解放前，我父亲是周家的佃户，母亲是周家的女工。受周家的剥削压迫，搞得我们一家无吃无穿，父亲起早睡晚，面朝黄土背朝天，用血汗换来的粮食，一担担送进了他家的谷仓。自己是禾镰上壁，就没饭吃，只好吃糠咽菜，外出做工讨米。那年，父亲在他家做木工，扛大树时被压得口吐鲜血，从此就得下吐血病，没几年就活活的病死了。我母亲在周家做女工、当奶妈干了十多年，为了喂饱周扬的妹妹，我两岁多的妹妹在家拖得病死了，刚生下三天的小弟弟也忍痛送给了人家。
    解放前，我也在周家做了四年工。前两年是侍候周扬的第一个“太太”（名叫二奶奶），后两年侍候周扬的哥哥周谷宜。给周谷宜做工，一天从早到晚，累得手痛腰痠，周谷宜却不管你的死活，一天只给我吃一餐饭。更令人可恨的是周扬的“太太”，这家伙磨勒穷人真是恶毒得很，提起来我心里就恨透了她。她自己游手好闲，终日打麻将，整天叫我给干些牛马不干的活。她很讲究“臭卫生”，厕所里的粪缸板子，规定每天要我冲洗揩抹一次，倘若发现板上有泥土，就把我训骂一顿。叫人更气愤的是给她洗马桶，她的规定和要求，恶毒到了极点。马桶要用瓷瓦片刮洗，刮一次冲一次，要刮得桶内看不到一点屎尿的痕渍，要洗得马桶闻不到一点气味。我这样当牛做马地侍候她一家，可她给我住的是茅柴棚，给我吃的是一点残汤剩饭，人病饥寒，穷人的死活她一点也不管。
    解放前夕，周扬为了让他吸食农民血汗的封建地主家庭，逃避农民对他们的斗争，出谋划策，叫他的母亲和姐姐，先后把水田变卖了，全家搬进了周扬工作的机关。土地改革时，他家安然无事，躲过了农民对他们的斗争和惩罚。周扬的哥哥周谷宜是个民愤极大的地头蛇、反动的地主分子。一九五○年周扬却把他接了出去，安插到了省里一个机关工作，伪保长摇身一变成了国家干部。周谷宜“退休”回到田庄后，每月拿着“退休”金，饱食终日，乐享“晚年”，生活之好，不亚当年。贫下中农看了，无不气愤极了。
    揭开周扬反动的家底，就不难理解周扬为什么顽固透顶，对党、对社会主义、对毛泽东思想有这么大的仇恨了。“狼终究是狼”。从揭露周扬的罪恶事实来看，他在革命队伍里混了几十年，他那反动的地主阶级立场和本性，一点也没有改变。
    毛主席说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要放松自己的警惕性。”毛主席的话是照妖镜，把周扬这个黑帮头子放在镜下一照，原形毕露，原来披着马克思列宁主义外衣的周扬，是一个不甘心死亡的封建地主阶级的孝子贤孙，是一个披着画皮的野心狼，妄想在中国重新建立地主资本家的“天堂”。
    周扬，你真是疯狗咬太阳，不晓得天高地厚。你也不睁开眼睛看看，今天是什么时代！告诉你，如今不是三十年代，而是伟大的毛泽东时代。你没有想到吧！一个过去任你们压榨的女佣人，今天居然站出来向你这“东家”猛烈开火吧！警告你，周扬：你要复辟资本主义，这只是白日作梦。你要反对毛泽东思想，我们贫下中农决不容你！我们坚决读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。我们要举起锄头，拿起镰刀，向周扬等一伙牛鬼蛇神猛烈开火，保卫战无不胜的毛泽东思想，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
