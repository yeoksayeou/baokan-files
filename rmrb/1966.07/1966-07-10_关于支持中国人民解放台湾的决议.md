The emergency conference of Asian and African writers held in Beijing from June 27 to July 9, 1966, strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for occupying China's Taiwan Province.

On June 27, 1950, the U.S. imperialists, who are extremely hostile to the Chinese and Asian and African peoples, invaded Korea while simultaneously occupying Taiwan Province by force. Since then, the U.S. imperialists have gradually turned Taiwan Province into a base for threatening the Chinese mainland and invading Asia.

The conference pointed out that the U.S. imperialists, in order to save their failing situation, are adjusting their counter-revolutionary global strategy, shifting their strategic focus from Europe to Asia. While they are sending more troops to Vietnam and further expanding their aggression in Vietnam, they are also frequently violating China's airspace and territorial waters, engaging in military provocations, and, in collusion with their lackeys and accomplices, surrounding and attempting to "contain" China. The Chinese people will not be intimidated by any threats or provocations from the U.S. imperialists.

The conference solemnly reaffirmed: Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Liberating Taiwan is the sacred mission of the Chinese people.

The conference unanimously expressed its resolute support for the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan, affirming that the Chinese people have the right to liberate their territory of Taiwan at any time and by any means, and to hoist the five-star red flag over Taiwan Province.

The conference firmly demands that the U.S. imperialists immediately withdraw all their armed forces from Taiwan Province and the Taiwan Strait region.

U.S. imperialists, get out of Taiwan! Get out of the whole of Asia!

    关于支持中国人民解放台湾的决议
    一九六六年六月二十七日至七月九日在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议，强烈谴责美帝国主义霸占中国领土台湾省。
    一九五○年六月二十七日，极端仇视中国人民和亚非人民的美帝国主义，在发动侵略朝鲜战争的同时，武装霸占了中国的台湾省，从那时以来，美帝国主义一步步地把中国台湾省变成了它威胁中国大陆、侵略亚洲的基地。
    会议指出，美帝国主义为了挽救它失败的困境，正在调整它的反革命全球战略，把战略重点从欧洲转移到亚洲。——它在向越南大举增兵，进一步扩大侵略越南的战争的同时，不断侵犯中国领空领海，进行军事挑衅，并在它的走狗和帮凶的合伙下，包围和妄图“遏制”中国。美帝国主义任何威胁和挑衅吓不倒中国人民。
    会议庄严重申：台湾是中国领土的不可分割的一部分。解放台湾是中国人民的神圣任务。
    会议一致表示，坚决支持中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争，确认中国人民有权在任何时候，采取任何方式解放自己的领土台湾，把五星红旗插到台湾省。
    会议坚决要求美帝国主义立即从中国台湾省和台湾海峡地区撤走它一切的武装力量。
    美帝国主义从中国台湾滚出去！从整个亚洲滚出去！
