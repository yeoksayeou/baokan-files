	Highly Raise the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought
	Open Fire on the Black Line of Literature and Art Led by Zhou Yang
		—Selected Big-Character Posters—
		Editor’s Note: The several big-character posters selected for publication today expose the heinous crimes of the Zhou Yang clique in poisoning people’s minds and corrupting the younger generation. They have used art schools, publishing houses, and other cultural units to spread the poisonous ideas of capitalism and feudalism. Under the guise of “learning from” and “inheriting,” they have actually promoted the restoration of old customs and the worship of foreign things. Using “brand names” as bait, they have pursued high salaries, high royalties, and high bonuses, implementing the “three names” policy (famous writers, famous directors, famous actors) and the “three highs” policy (high salaries, high royalties, high bonuses). With these bourgeois methods, they have been carrying out “peaceful evolution” among the youth, cultivating bourgeois successors. They have also been recruiting and colluding with others, forming a clique of black elements, attempting to restore capitalism.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “The proletariat must transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview. In this regard, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not been truly resolved.” He also said: “The class enemy will definitely seek opportunities to express themselves.” For sixteen years, the Zhou Yang clique has stubbornly opposed the proletarian worldview according to their reactionary bourgeois worldview, poisoning our literary and artistic circles and cadres, attempting to change the color of our country. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, cut off the claws of the Zhou Yang clique, thoroughly uproot this black line, thoroughly settle their accounts, thoroughly criticize their fallacies, and firmly establish proletarian leadership on the cultural and artistic front.

	Eradicating the Poison of Zhou Yang in Art Schools
		—Selected from a Big-Character Poster by the Education Section of the Ministry of Culture—

	Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the true face of Zhou Yang, the revisionist “patriarch” of literature and art, has been exposed to the world.

	Zhou Yang is an old hand at opposing the Party and socialism. To cultivate bourgeois and revisionist successors, his claws have also reached the educational sector, implementing bourgeois dictatorship on the field of art education. He has colluded with the demons and monsters in the art education sector, resisting the Party’s educational and literary policies, and opposing the great Mao Zedong Thought.

	During the period when our national economy faced temporary difficulties, the head of the black clique, Zhou Yang, thought the time for counter-revolutionary restoration had come, stirring up trouble everywhere, and his arrogance knew no bounds. Especially in 1961, he personally took the lead in maliciously distorting, slandering, and attacking the educational policies proposed by the Party and Chairman Mao. With deep hatred, he viciously attacked and opposed Mao Zedong Thought, saying: “In literary theory textbooks, we should not quote Chairman Mao too much,” openly advocating the inclusion of more “classics” from ancient and modern Chinese and foreign sources. Zhou Yang set a bourgeois and revisionist policy for art education that opposed the Party and Chairman Mao’s educational and literary policies.

	First, Chairman Mao teaches us: Education must serve proletarian politics. Zhou Yang, however, went to great lengths to oppose education serving proletarian politics. He saw revolutionary teachers and students who staged modern revolutionary plays to support current political struggles as thorns in his side, accusing such actions of being “irregular” and having a “cultural work team style,” repeatedly rejecting and suppressing them. He also absurdly claimed that “too many political movements in schools would hinder professional studies,” using this to oppose students participating in political activities and serving proletarian politics. Obviously, his goal was to make our proletarian art schools serve bourgeois politics.

	Second, Chairman Mao teaches us: Education must be combined with productive labor, “We should enable those receiving education to develop in ethics, intelligence, and physical education, becoming socially conscious and cultured laborers.” Zhou Yang was extremely hostile to Chairman Mao’s teachings and openly defied them. Through black elements like Lin Mo Han, he vigorously opposed art school students participating in labor, explicitly stating: “Some professional students can be exempted from labor,” even absurdly claiming that “dancers sweating is labor.” Zhou Yang also openly proposed that “art schools should cultivate specialized talents, not laborers,” blatantly opposing Chairman Mao’s educational policies and the revolutionization and laborization of art school teachers and students. The essence of Zhou Yang’s reactionary proposal was to cultivate spiritual aristocrats, creating a social foundation for the restoration of capitalism.

	Third, Chairman Mao said: “We must respect our own history and cannot sever history. However, this respect is to give history a definite scientific position, respecting the dialectical development of history, not praising the past and denigrating the present, not praising any feudal poison.” Zhou Yang, however, vigorously promoted and advocated using the works of 18th and 19th-century foreigners, ancients, and the dead, as well as modern revisionist and 1930s reactionary works as teaching materials, saying: “The ancients are more numerous than the moderns; three to one is the minimum.” He also shouted: “We must absorb a large amount of foreign things.” On the other hand, he was extremely hostile to Mao Zedong Thought—the peak and most active Marxism-Leninism of our time. He slandered Chairman Mao’s works as “political slogans” and “political calls,” opposing art school teachers and students from studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works. Zhou Yang’s stubborn opposition to Chairman Mao’s instructions, hostility to Mao Zedong Thought, and praise of the past while denigrating the present were all to cultivate bourgeois successors, making our next generation slaves of foreigners, ancients, and the dead.

	Under the control of the Zhou Yang clique, the images of foreigners, ancients, the dead, emperors, generals, and talented scholars have flooded art schools. Once students enter the gates of some art schools, it is as if they have entered the “heaven” of 18th and 19th-century foreigners, ancients, and the dead, as if they have entered the world of capitalism and revisionism.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “Anything reactionary, if you do not strike it, it will not fall.” We must follow Chairman Mao’s teachings, study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and use the great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly expose and criticize the heinous crimes committed by the revisionist literary and art clique leader Zhou Yang in art education. We must resolutely overthrow the Zhou Yang clique and thoroughly eliminate the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black line in art schools. We must seize the educational front from the hands of counter-revolutionary revisionists and make art schools truly follow the Party and Chairman Mao’s instructions, becoming a front for cultivating proletarian revolutionary successors.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
　　向以周扬为首的文艺黑线开火
　　——大字报选——
    编者按：今天选登的几篇大字报，揭露了周扬黑帮毒害人们心灵、腐蚀青年一代的滔天罪行。他们通过艺术院校、出版机构等文化单位，散布资本主义、封建主义的思想毒素。他们以“借鉴”“继承”为名，行崇洋复古之实。他们以“名牌”为诱饵，钞票挂帅，推行“三名”主义（名作家、名导演、名演员），“三高”政策（高薪金、高稿酬、高奖金），用这一套资产阶级的办法，在青年中大搞“和平演变”，培养资产阶级接班人。他们还到处招降纳叛，结党营私，结成一伙黑帮，妄图实现资本主义复辟。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”他又说：“阶级敌人是一定要寻找机会表现他们自己的。”十六年来，周扬黑帮正是按照他们那一套反动的资产阶级的世界观，顽固地反对无产阶级的世界观，毒害我们的文艺界和文艺队伍，妄图改变我们国家的颜色。在这场无产阶级文化大革命里，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，斩断周扬黑帮的魔爪，彻底挖掉这条黑线，彻底清算他们的一切罪行，彻底批判他们的一切谬论，在文化艺术阵地上，牢固地建立起无产阶级的领导权。
　　肃清周扬在艺术院校的流毒
　　——选自文化部教育司的大字报
    在毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，周扬这个修正主义文艺“祖师爷”的原形，暴露在光天化日之下了。
    周扬是个反党反社会主义的老手。为了培养资产阶级、修正主义的接班人，他的魔爪也伸到了教育界，在艺术教育这块阵地上实行资产阶级专政。他和艺术教育界中的牛鬼蛇神结党营私，相互勾结，抗拒党的教育方针和文艺方针，反对伟大的毛泽东思想。
    在我国经济遭受暂时困难的时期，黑帮头子周扬认为反革命复辟的时机到了，四处煽风点火，气焰十分嚣张。特别是在一九六一年，他亲自出马，对党和毛主席提出的教育方针进行了恶意的歪曲、诬蔑和攻击。他怀着刻骨的仇恨，恶毒地攻击和反对毛泽东思想，说：“文艺理论教材中，毛主席的话不要引用太多”，公然主张要多引用中外古今的“名著”。周扬为艺术教育规定了一条与党和毛主席的教育方针、文艺方针相对立的资产阶级、修正主义的方针。
    一，毛主席教导我们：教育要为无产阶级的政治服务。周扬却千方百计地反对教育为无产阶级政治服务。他对革命师生为配合当前政治斗争而编排的革命现代剧目，视为眼中钉，肉中刺，指责这种作法“不正规”，是“文工团作风”，一再排斥和打击。他还胡说什么“学校搞政治运动太多，就要妨碍业务学习”，以此来反对学生参加政治活动，反对为无产阶级政治服务。显然，他的目的就是要使我们无产阶级的艺术院校去为资产阶级的政治服务。
    二，毛主席教导我们：教育要与生产劳动相结合，“应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”周扬对毛主席的教导极端仇视，公然违抗。他通过林默涵等黑帮分子，竭力反对艺术院校的学生参加劳动，明文规定：“有些专业的学生可以免除劳动”，甚至还胡说什么“搞舞蹈的跳一身汗就是劳动”。周扬还公然提出“艺术院校应该是培养专门人材，不是培养劳动者”的主张，明目张胆地反对毛主席的教育方针，反对艺术院校师生革命化和劳动化。周扬这个反动主张的实质，就是要培养精神贵族，为资本主义复辟制造社会基础。
    三，毛主席说：“我们必须尊重自己的历史，决不能割断历史。但是这种尊重，是给历史以一定的科学的地位，是尊重历史的辩证法的发展，而不是颂古非今，不是赞扬任何封建的毒素。”而周扬却大力宣扬和鼓吹把十八、十九世纪洋人、古人、死人以及现代修正主义和三十年代的反动作品作为教学内容，他说什么“古比今要多，三比一是起码的”；他还叫嚷“要大量地吸收外国的东西”。另一方面，他十分仇视毛泽东思想——当代马列主义的顶峰、最高最活的马列主义。他诬蔑毛主席的著作是“政治口号”、“政治号召”，反对艺术院校的师生学习和运用毛主席著作。周扬这样顽固地反对毛主席的指示，仇视毛泽东思想，颂古非今，就是为了培养资产阶级的接班人，要我们的下一代作洋人、古人、死人的奴才。
    在周扬这伙黑帮的把持下，洋人、古人、死人、帝王将相和才子佳人的形象，在艺术院校里泛滥成灾。学生一进某些艺术院校的大门，简直象走进了十八、十九世纪洋人、古人、死人的“天国”，简直象走进了资本主义和修正主义的世界。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，活学活用毛主席著作，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，彻底揭露、批判修正主义文艺黑帮头子周扬在艺术教育中所犯下的滔天罪行，坚决打倒周扬等黑帮分子，彻底清除艺术院校中的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑线。我们一定要从反革命修正主义分子手中夺回无产阶级的教育阵地，使艺术院校真正按照党和毛主席的指示，成为培养无产阶级革命接班人的阵地。
