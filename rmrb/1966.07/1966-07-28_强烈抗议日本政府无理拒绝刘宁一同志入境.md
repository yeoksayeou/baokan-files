	China and Committee and seven other organizations issued statements or had their leaders make speeches
	Strongly protesting the Japanese government's unreasonable refusal to allow Comrade Liu Ningyi to enter the country
	All unanimously pointed out that this extremely serious incident once again exposes the Japanese government's reactionary face of bowing to the U.S. imperialists, colluding with the Soviet revisionists, and hostility towards China and the Chinese people; all consequences that harm the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan will be borne by the Japanese government and all reactionaries involved in this conspiracy

	New China News Agency, July 27th: Today, seven people's organizations in China, including the China and Committee, issued statements or had their leaders make speeches, strongly protesting the Japanese government's unreasonable refusal to allow Liu Ningyi, the leader of the Chinese delegation to the 12th World Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, to enter the country.

	The statements and speeches of various people's organizations all strongly pointed out that the Japanese government's unreasonable refusal to allow Comrade Liu Ningyi to enter the country is an extremely serious incident. This once again exposes the Japanese government's reactionary face of bowing to U.S. imperialism, colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership, and hostility towards China and the Chinese people. Our country's various people's organizations solemnly pointed out: the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan is absolutely unbreakable. The Japanese government's hostile actions towards the Chinese people, and all consequences that harm the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan arising therefrom, will be borne by the Japanese government and all reactionaries involved in this conspiracy.

	The Chinese people's organizations that issued statements or had their leaders make speeches are: the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the Chinese-Japanese Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, and the All-China Women's Federation.

	The statement of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace said, the Chinese people have always been active supporters and participants of the Japanese anti-nuclear and hydrogen bomb movement and its successive world conferences. Since the first conference, Comrade Liu Ningyi has led delegations to attend on multiple occasions, together with the broad masses of the Japanese people and progressive friends from various countries around the world, making important contributions to the success of the world conference, opposing U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war, safeguarding peace in Asia and the world, and strengthening the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan. This time, Comrade Liu Ningyi led the Chinese delegation to Japan to participate in the 12th World Conference in accordance with our consistent stance, supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S., opposing the U.S. imperialists' and their accomplices' nuclear blackmail and nuclear war policy, and further developing the friendly cause between the peoples of China and Japan. The Chinese people's stance is upright and above board, and it is supported and approved by the Japanese people and the people of the world. The Japanese government's brazen refusal to allow Comrade Liu Ningyi to enter the country is completely unreasonable, completely contrary to the will and interests of the Japanese people, and completely contrary to the wishes of all revolutionary peoples of the world. The statement warns the Japanese government that such actions will only backfire. The fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, established in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism, is unbreakable by any force.

	The statement of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity said, the Japanese government's unreasonable decision is a sign of the weakness of the Japanese reactionaries. They are afraid of the brave Japanese people, afraid of the great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and afraid of the peoples of various countries who want liberation and revolution. However, they cannot stop the tide of great unity between the peoples of China and Japan against the U.S., nor can they stop the tide of great unity against imperialism by the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. No matter how the Japanese government goes against the current, no matter what tricks and conspiracies it plays, it will not help U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, but will only reap what it has sown.

	The statement of the Chinese-Japanese Friendship Association pointed out that the Japanese government's various attempts to prevent the leader of the Chinese delegation from entering the country are not accidental. This is another serious step taken by the Japanese government in its unyielding pursuit of U.S. imperialism's war policy and policy of aggression, actively participating in the aggression against Vietnam, openly hostile to the Chinese people, and destroying the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people, and it is also intolerable to the Japanese people and the peoples of various countries.

	The statement of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: We warn the Japanese reactionary government that the Chinese workers and people are not to be trifled with, and the fighting friendship between the workers and people of China and Japan is absolutely unbreakable by the Japanese reactionaries. The Japanese reactionary government, following the U.S., colluding with the Soviet revisionist leadership, hostile to China, and acting as a henchman of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, is against the wishes of the vast majority of the Japanese people and will not end well.

	The leaders of the All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation jointly issued a statement pointing out that the fighting friendship between the peoples and youth of China and Japan, established in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, is unbreakable by anyone. The Japanese government's reactionary actions will only further arouse the peoples and youth of China and Japan to unite closely and resolutely fight against all reactionary forces that destroy Sino-Japanese friendship.

	The statement of the All-China Women's Federation said, the Sato government's reckless actions cannot stop the victory of the people of the world in opposing imperialism led by the United States and safeguarding world peace. The statement pointed out that any reactionary will not end well, just as Chairman Mao pointed out: "Those who are dead set on being led by the nose by U.S. imperialism will end up as sacrifices for U.S. imperialism."

    中国和委会等七团体分别发表声明或由负责人发表谈话
    强烈抗议日本政府无理拒绝刘宁一同志入境
    一致愤慨地指出：这一极其严重的事件，又一次暴露日本政府屈从美帝、联合苏修、敌视中国和中国人民的反动面目；一切损害中日两国人民友好关系的后果，都要由日本政府和参与这一阴谋的一切反动派承担
    新华社二十七日讯　中国和委会等七个人民团体今天分别发表声明或由负责人发表谈话，强烈抗议日本政府无理拒绝前往日本参加第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的中国代表团团长刘宁一入境。
    各人民团体的声明和谈话都极为愤慨地指出，日本政府无理拒绝刘宁一同志入境是一个极其严重的事件。这又一次暴露了日本政府屈从美帝国主义，联合苏联修正主义领导集团，敌视中国和中国人民的反动面目。我国各人民团体严正指出：中日两国人民的战斗友谊是绝对破坏不了的。日本政府这一敌视中国人民的行为，由此而引起的一切损害中日两国人民友好关系的后果，都要由日本政府和参与这一阴谋的一切反动派承担。
    发表声明或由负责人发表谈话的中国各人民团体是：中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中国日本友好协会、中华全国总工会、中华全国青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会和中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的声明说，中国人民一贯是日本禁止原氢弹运动及其历届世界大会的积极支持者和参加者。从第一届大会以来，刘宁一同志曾多次率领代表团与会，与日本广大人民一起，与世界各国进步朋友一起，为世界大会的成功，为反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，为保卫亚洲和世界和平，为加强中日两国人民的战斗友谊，做出了重要的贡献。刘宁一同志这次率领中国代表团前往日本参加第十二届世界大会，是按照我们一贯的立场，支持日本人民的反美正义斗争，反对美帝国主义及其帮凶的核讹诈、核战争政策，进一步发展中日两国人民之间的友好事业。中国人民的立场是光明磊落的，是受到日本人民和全世界人民的赞同和支持的。日本政府这次悍然拒绝刘宁一同志入境，是毫无道理的，是完全违反日本人民的意志和利益的，是与全世界一切革命人民的愿望背道而驰的。声明警告日本政府，指出这种行为只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。中日两国人民在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中建立起来的战斗友谊，是任何势力也破坏不了的。
    中国亚非团结委员会的声明说，日本政府的无理决定，是日本反动派虚弱的表现。它害怕英勇的日本人民，害怕以毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民，害怕要解放、要革命的各国人民。但是，它决阻挡不了中日两国人民反美大团结的潮流，阻挡不了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民反帝大团结的潮流。不管日本政府怎样倒行逆施，不管它还玩弄什么阴谋花招，都帮不了美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的忙，而只能自食其恶果。
    中国日本友好协会的声明指出，日本政府千方百计地禁止中国代表团团长入境绝不是偶然的。这是日本政府死心塌地追随美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策、积极参与侵略越南战争、露骨敌视中国人民、破坏中日两国人民的友谊的又一个严重步骤。这是中国人民绝不能容忍的，也是日本人民和各国人民绝不能容忍的。
    中华全国总工会的声明说：我们正告日本反动政府，中国工人和人民是不可侮的，中日两国工人和人民的战斗友谊是日本反动派绝对破坏不了的。日本反动政府追随美帝、联合苏联修正主义领导集团、敌视中国，甘当美帝国主义侵越帮凶，是违背日本绝大多数人民的愿望的，是绝对不会有好下场的。
    中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会负责人联合发表谈话指出，中日两国人民和青年在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中建立起来的战斗友谊，是任何人也破坏不了的。日本政府的这一反动行径，必将更加激起中日两国人民和青年紧密地团结起来，同破坏中日友好的一切反动势力进行坚决的斗争。
    中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会的声明说，佐藤政府这种倒行逆施，丝毫也不能阻挡全世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义以及保卫世界和平事业的胜利前进。声明指出，任何反动派都决不会有好下场，正如毛主席指出的：“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”
