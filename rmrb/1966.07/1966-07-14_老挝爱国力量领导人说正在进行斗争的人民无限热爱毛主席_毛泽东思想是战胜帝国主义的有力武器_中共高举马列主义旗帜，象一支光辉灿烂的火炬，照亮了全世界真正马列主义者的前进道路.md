Laotian Patriotic Forces Leader: People Engaged in Struggle Have Limitless Love for Chairman Mao
	Mao Zedong Thought Is a Powerful Weapon to Defeat Imperialism
	The CPC Holds High the Banner of Marxism-Leninism, Like a Brilliant Torch, Illuminating the Path Forward for All True Marxists-Leninists Around the World

KANGA, July 13 (Xinhua) — Leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao Neutralist Forces, including representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee such as Nouhak Phoumsavanh and Colonel Doun, recently made statements highly praising Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) and its great leader Chairman Mao Zedong for leading the Chinese people to achieve one great victory after another over the past 45 years.

Nouhak Phoumsavanh said, “Over the past 45 years, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the CPC has liberated the Chinese people, successfully carried out socialist revolution and construction, and created a great historical feat for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Especially, it has made Asia’s peoples have a new, strong, and reliable China with 650 million people.” He said, “This is the victory of Marxism-Leninism on the land of China with 650 million people. This is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.”

He praised the CPC for firmly holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, like a brilliant torch illuminating the path forward for all true Marxists-Leninists around the world, making the truth of Marxism-Leninism show unparalleled power and influence in the world.

He also praised the CPC for holding high the banner of proletarian internationalism, supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He said that this proletarian support makes the peoples of the three continents engaged in liberation struggles more trust, respect, and have limitless love for the Chinese people and Chairman Mao Zedong.

Colonel Doun said, “The Chinese people, with Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, have achieved victory step by step and advanced forward on the path of victory. This proves that the people engaged in struggle can only achieve victory with Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon.” He further said, “Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon to defeat imperialism and all reactionaries. To defeat imperialism, I believe that learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought is a necessary task.” He expressed his firm belief that “the world revolutionary struggle supported by China will definitely achieve victory, and the revolutionary peoples will definitely defeat old and new colonialism.”

    诺哈·冯沙万说：“四十五年来，中国共产党在毛泽东主席的英明领导下，解放了中国人民，胜利地进行了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，为中国革命和世界革命创造了伟大的历史，特别是使亚洲各国人民有了一个新的、坚强的、可以信赖和依靠的六亿五千万人民的中国。”他说：“这是马克思列宁主义在具有六亿五千万人口的中国土地上的胜利，这是毛泽东思想的胜利。”
    他赞扬中国共产党坚决高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，象一支光辉灿烂的火炬照亮了世界各国真正马克思列宁主义者的前进道路，使马克思列宁主义的真理在世界上显示出无比的威力和作用。
    他还赞扬中国共产党高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的革命斗争。他说，这种无产阶级的支持，使正在进行解放斗争的三大洲人民更加信赖、尊敬和无限热爱中国人民和毛泽东主席。
    敦上校说：“中国人民以毛泽东思想为武器，使自己的斗争一步步取得胜利，在胜利的道路上向前跃进。这证明正在进行斗争的人民只有以毛泽东思想为武器才能取得胜利。”他又说：“毛泽东思想是战胜帝国主义和一切反动派的有力武器，为了战胜帝国主义，我认为学习和运用毛泽东思想是一项必须的任务。”他表示坚信：“得到中国支持的世界革命斗争一定会取得胜利，革命的人民一定会战胜新老殖民主义。”
