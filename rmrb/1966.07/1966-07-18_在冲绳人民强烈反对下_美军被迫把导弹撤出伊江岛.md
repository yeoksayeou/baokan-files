	Under strong opposition from the Okinawan people, the U.S. military was forced to withdraw missiles from Ie Island.

	New York, July 16th — According to reports from Tokyo: Approximately 50 kilometers north of Naha City, the 8,000 residents of Ie Island in Okinawa have, through arduous struggle, compelled the U.S. armed forces to withdraw "Hawk" missiles from the island on the 15th.

	The U.S. military has occupied 63% of the land on Ie Island, acting as if they are the masters of the island. They brought in two "Hawk" missiles and, despite the opposition of the islanders, attempted to build missile facilities on the island.

	Upon receiving the news that the U.S. authorities planned to establish missile facilities on the island, the residents formed an organization to fight against turning the island into a U.S. missile base. From the 12th to the 15th of July, over a thousand people participated in sit-in protests. On the evening of the 14th, approximately a thousand residents held a protest rally.

	Under the strong opposition of all the island's residents, the U.S. military was forced to withdraw the missiles using large trucks on the 15th. The residents said they would continue to hold sit-in protests until all the attached machinery and tools are completely withdrawn.

　　在冲绳人民强烈反对下
　　美军被迫把导弹撤出伊江岛
    新华社十六日讯　东京消息：那霸市以北约五十公里的冲绳伊江岛的八千居民通过艰苦斗争，迫使美国武装部队于十五日把“隼式”导弹撤出伊江岛。
    美国军队霸占了伊江岛的百分之六十三的土地，俨然以岛上的主人自居，运来了两枚“隼式”导弹，并且不顾岛民的反对，企图在岛上修建导弹设施。
    岛上居民在接到美国当局将在岛上设立导弹设施的消息后，就成立了一个组织，为反对把这个海岛变成美国导弹基地而斗争。从七月十二日到十五日的四天中，有一千多人举行静坐示威。十四日晚上，约有一千个居民举行了抗议集会。
    在岛上全体居民强烈反对下，美军被迫在十五日用大卡车把导弹撤走。居民们说，他们将继续举行静坐示威，直到附设的机器和工具统统撤走为止。
