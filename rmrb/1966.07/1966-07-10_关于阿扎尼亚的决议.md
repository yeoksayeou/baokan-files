Edition: 5

The emergency meeting of Asian and African writers held in Beijing from June 27, 1966, after hearing the report of the Azanian delegation and fully discussing the proposed issues, noted:

The fascist colonial "regime" of Vorster is increasingly brutally oppressing the people of Azania (the land of the blacks), including progressive writers;

It is further noted that the ever-increasing American and British monopoly capital has reached twenty billion pounds, equivalent to the total investment of imperialism in Africa. It is also noted that maintaining Azania as a slave colony to plunder and loot its wealth is of great interest to imperialism. The people of Azania believe that the Vorster fascist colonialist group is merely a small partner of Anglo-American imperialism;

It is urgently noted that the current explosive situation in southern Africa is the result of British colonialists conspiring with Vorster to cunningly plot under the guise of "independence," handing over Basutoland to Vorster's friend, the number one reactionary chief Jonathan, Bechuanaland to Seretse Khama, and Swaziland to King Sobhuza's autocratic rule;

It is believed that this deceitful "independence" foreshadows a crisis, the result of which may mean further large-scale destruction of the Pan-Africanist Congress forces taking refuge in Basutoland, Bechuanaland, and Swaziland. Imperialists are secretly carrying out this evil plot to establish a reactionary puppet unified front in these regions, with the sole aim of suppressing the struggle of the Azanian people;

It fully supports the determination of the Azanian people under the correct leadership of the Pan-Africanist Congress, chaired by Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe—the organization that is the true and sole representative of the Azanian people's liberation movement and voice—to use revolutionary violence to counter reactionary violence, smash the Vorster fascist colonialist regime, thoroughly eliminate the control of Anglo-American monopoly capital over Azania's economy, culture, and other aspects, and establish a truly democratic and socialist Azania;

It calls on all Asian and African writers and peoples to fully support the struggle of the Azanian people and writers, and to widely publicize the just struggle of the Azanian people and writers under the correct leadership of the Pan-Africanist Congress.

    关于阿扎尼亚的决议
    自一九六六年六月二十七日起在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议，在听取了阿扎尼亚代表团的报告和充分讨论了提出的各项问题后：
    注意到维沃尔德法西斯殖民“政权”日益凶恶地压迫阿扎尼亚（意即黑人的土地）人民，包括进步作家；
    进一步注意到，不断增加的美国和英国的垄断资本已高达二十亿英镑，相当于帝国主义在非洲的总投资；并进一步注意到，把阿扎尼亚保持为奴隶殖民地以便掠夺和抢劫其财富，对帝国主义有密切的利害关系。阿扎尼亚人认为，维沃尔德法西斯殖民主义集团只不过是英美帝国主义的小伙伴；
    提请对目前南部非洲爆炸性局势予以迫切的注意。这个局势是英国殖民主义者与维沃尔德共谋，阴险地策划假托“独立”之名，将巴苏陀兰交给维沃尔德的朋友、头号反动酋长乔那坦，把贝专纳交给赛莱兹·卡马和把斯威士兰交给索博扎国王的专制统治而造成的；
    认为这种狡诈的假“独立”预兆着一个危机，其结果可能意味着进一步大量摧残在巴苏陀兰、贝专纳和斯威士兰避难的阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会的力量，帝国主义者正在秘密地推行这个邪恶的阴谋，以便在这些地区成立反动傀儡的统一阵线，其唯一目的是企图镇压阿扎尼亚人民的斗争；
    完全支持以罗伯特·曼加利索·索布克韦为主席的阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会——这个组织是阿扎尼亚人民真正的、唯一有代表性的解放运动与喉舌——正确领导下的阿扎尼亚人民的决心：用革命的暴力来反对反动的暴力，粉碎维沃尔德法西斯殖民主义政权，彻底消除英美垄断资本对阿扎尼亚经济、文化等方面的控制，并建立一个真正民主的和社会主义的阿扎尼亚；
    号召全体亚非作家和人民全力支持阿扎尼亚人民和作家的斗争，并尽可能广泛地宣传阿扎尼亚人民和作家在泛非主义者大会的正确领导下所进行的正义斗争。
