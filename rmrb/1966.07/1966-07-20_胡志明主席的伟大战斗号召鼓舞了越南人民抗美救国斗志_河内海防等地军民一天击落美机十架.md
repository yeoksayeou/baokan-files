The heroic military and civilian population of North Vietnam, inspired by Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great battle call, are fighting with high morale. On the afternoon of the 19th, they achieved a great victory by shooting down ten American aggressor planes, damaging several, and capturing a batch of American pilots in the battle against invading American aggressor planes.

In the afternoon of the 19th, American aggressor planes once again invaded the airspace over the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and bombed residential areas in Haiphong City and the industrial city of Viet Tri in Phu Tho Province. In addition, American planes also invaded the airspace over the capital of the North Vietnam Autonomous Region, Thai Nguyen City, and the provinces of Yen Phu and Ha Tay.

The anti-aircraft units of the people's army, the local militia, and the air force fighters defending Hanoi, Haiphong, and other places, with hatred burning in their hearts, displayed a spirit of decisive battle and decisive victory. On the ground and in the sky, they bravely attacked the enemy, smashing the arrogant attacks of multiple batches of enemy planes.

When the enemy planes just flew into the airspace over Hanoi and had not yet had the chance to wreak havoc, they were immediately shot down by the fierce ground fire of the local military and civilians. The remaining enemy planes were then bravely intercepted by the heroic Vietnamese People's Air Force. With the close cooperation of the military and civilians of Hanoi City and Yen Phu Province, the People's Air Force shot down two enemy planes on the spot.

In Haiphong City, the local military and civilians shot down one enemy plane with fierce artillery fire.

The military and civilians of Viet Tri City and Ha Tay Province each shot down one invading American aggressor plane. The anti-aircraft units of the people's army defending Thai Nguyen City also shot down two enemy planes that day.
