Overseas Chinese in Guangxi, Yunnan, and Fujian recently held meetings to condemn the fascist crimes of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in their mad persecution of overseas Chinese; they firmly demand that the Indonesian government immediately give a clear and positive response to the issue of China sending ships to bring back the injured overseas Chinese who wish to return home, and immediately stop the cruel persecution of overseas Chinese.

At a meeting held by overseas Chinese who have returned to Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Nanning City, Ding Ming, a member of the National Committee of the Overseas Chinese Federation and vice-chairman of the Autonomous Region's Overseas Chinese Federation, expressed strong support for the June 29 note from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Indonesia, and expressed great indignation at the Indonesian government's unreasonable obstruction and harassment of the return of injured overseas Chinese. Chen Ya'nan, vice-chairman of the Nanning City Overseas Chinese Federation, refuted the various lies used by the Indonesian government to obstruct the return of injured overseas Chinese. He said that in the area around Surabaya where he had resided, many overseas Chinese, under the persecution of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, had lost everything and were left with no food or clothing, and were eager to return home. He said that China's government sending ships to bring back injured overseas Chinese is a sovereign right that cannot be stripped away, and the Indonesian government must immediately give a clear and positive response to this. Liao Ji Guang, a worker at the Guangxi Construction Engineering Bureau Mechanical Construction Company, said that his parents and many fellow overseas Chinese longed to return to their motherland, but Indonesian government officials had threatened and harassed them, saying that their property would be confiscated and they would all be killed, and at the same time, used complicated procedures to obstruct their applications to return home. Liao Ji Guang said that despite the Indonesian right-wing government using every vicious means, we overseas Chinese stand firm and hold out, because behind us is a powerful socialist motherland and 700 million people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

At a meeting held by representatives of various circles of overseas Chinese who have returned to Yunnan Province and Kunming City, Wang Zhao Ming, chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Overseas Chinese Federation, pointed out that the Indonesian government deliberately created obstacles to China's legitimate demand to send ships to bring back injured overseas Chinese, which is completely unreasonable behavior and will be condemned by the people of the world. Medical students Ye Min Niang and Wu Duancong at Kunming Medical College exposed at the meeting that while the Indonesian government was obstructing China from sending ships to bring back injured overseas Chinese, it was also carrying out even more vicious persecution of overseas Chinese. Wu Duancong's father was recently unjustly arrested and tortured by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary government, and his family has been reduced to poverty and lost their livelihood, urgently needing to return to the motherland. The overseas Chinese who attended the meeting expressed great indignation and strong protest against the Indonesian government's inhuman persecution of overseas Chinese and its brutal trampling of international relations norms.

At a meeting held by overseas Chinese who have returned to Fujian Province and Fuzhou City, Wang Han Jie, chairman of the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Federation, said that the Indonesian government's racist atrocities have swept across hundreds of towns and cities on the large and small islands of Indonesia, and are becoming increasingly severe. The Chinese government has repeatedly demanded that the Indonesian government immediately stop its persecution of overseas Chinese, but the Indonesian government has consistently ignored this, which cannot but cause our great indignation. He pointed out that the Indonesian government, in its disregard for trust and its cruel racist persecution of overseas Chinese, and its brutal trampling of international relations norms, is rare in the world. The right-wing leader of Indonesia, Nasution, actually said that what is happening in Indonesia now "is not racism," which is utterly shameless. He warned the Indonesian government that it must immediately stop all persecution of overseas Chinese and genuinely guarantee the safety of their lives and property and their legitimate right to return home. Zhou Jingming, who returned from Indonesia in April, recounted the ordeal of him and other overseas Chinese neighbors being cruelly persecuted by Indonesian right-wing thugs in October last year. Two of his neighbors were killed by Indonesian right-wing thugs, and some were imprisoned. When his family was forced to return to the motherland due to the loss of their livelihood by the right-wing thugs, the Indonesian reactionary government again obstructed and harassed them, detaining some of their luggage. His family later returned to the motherland with the assistance of fellow overseas Chinese and relatives. Chen Sheng'en, whose relatives were killed by the Indonesian government, angrily recounted how his father, Chen Zeyuan, was beaten to death by Indonesian right-wing thugs. He said that in the past month and a half, the Indonesian government has continued to rob, beat, arrest, and even massacre innocent overseas Chinese, ordering overseas Chinese in some places to leave their original residences within a deadline, forcing a large number of overseas Chinese to lose everything and become homeless. He said, I want to warn the Indonesian government: you will definitely have to pay for the blood debt you owe.

Overseas Chinese who have returned to Xiamen, Jinjiang, Longxi, and other regions in Fujian Province held a meeting in Xiamen, where speakers unanimously severely warned the Indonesian government to immediately stop its persecution of overseas Chinese and to quickly give a clear and positive response to China's legitimate demand to bring back injured overseas Chinese.

　　广西等地归侨集会谴责印尼当局无理阻挠受害华侨回国
　　印尼政府必须就我接侨问题作出明确肯定的答复
    新华社十四日讯　广西、云南、福建的归国华侨最近分别举行集会，谴责印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂迫害华侨的法西斯罪行；坚决要求印度尼西亚政府立即就我国政府派船前往接回自愿回国的受害华侨问题作出明确、肯定的答复，并且立即停止对华侨的残酷迫害。
    在广西壮族自治区和南宁市归国华侨举行的集会上，全国侨联委员、自治区侨联副主席丁明表示坚决拥护我国外交部六月二十九日给印度尼西亚的照会，并对印度尼西亚政府无理刁难和阻挠受害华侨回国，表示极大的愤慨。南宁市侨联副主席陈亚闹驳斥了印度尼西亚政府阻挠受害华侨回国的种种谎言。他说，在他侨居过的泗水一带，就有许多华侨在印度尼西亚右派反动势力的迫害下，倾家荡产，衣食无着而纷纷要求回国。他说，我国政府要派船接运受害华侨回国，是一个主权国家不容剥夺的护侨权利，印度尼西亚政府必须对此立即作出明确肯定的答复。广西建筑工程局机械施工公司职工廖集广说，他的父母亲和许多侨胞都渴望回到祖国，但印度尼西亚政府官员对他们进行了种种恐吓和刁难，说什么要把他们的财产全部没收，把他们全都杀死，同时以复杂的手续对他们的回国申请进行百般刁难。廖集广说，尽管印度尼西亚右派政府使尽了一切恶毒手段，但我们华侨站得稳、顶得住，因为在我们身后有强大的社会主义祖国，有用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿人民。
    在云南省、昆明市各界归国华侨代表举行的集会上，云南省归国华侨联合会主席王昭明指出，印度尼西亚政府对中国政府派船接运受害华侨回国这一正当要求竟蓄意制造障碍，这完全是蛮不讲理的行为，必将受到世界人民的谴责。昆明医学院学生叶民娘、吴端聪在会上揭露了印度尼西亚政府在阻挠中国派船接运受害华侨的同时，对华侨进行了更加恶毒的迫害。吴端聪的父亲不久前遭到印度尼西亚右派反动政府无理逮捕，并受到拷打和种种迫害，目前他家已经倾家荡产，丧失生计，迫切要求回到祖国。到会的归国华侨对印度尼西亚政府灭绝人性地迫害华侨、粗暴地践踏国际关系准则表示无比的愤慨和强烈的抗议。
    福建省归国华侨联合会主席王汉杰在福建省、福州市归国华侨举行的集会上说，印度尼西亚政府迫害华侨的种族主义暴行，席卷印度尼西亚大小岛屿的数百个城镇，而且愈演愈烈，我国政府多次要求印度尼西亚政府立即停止迫害华侨的罪行，印度尼西亚政府始终置之不理，这不能不引起我们的极大愤慨。他指出，印度尼西亚政府这样不顾信义，残酷地对华侨进行种族主义迫害，粗暴地践踏国际关系准则，是世界上少有的。印度尼西亚右派将领头子纳苏蒂安竟然说什么目前在印度尼西亚发生的“不是种族主义”，真是无耻之至。他警告印度尼西亚政府必须立即停止对华侨的一切迫害，切实保障华侨生命财产的安全和他们自愿回国的正当权利。四月间从印度尼西亚回国的华侨邹敬明控诉了他和其他华侨邻居们去年十月遭到印度尼西亚右派暴徒残酷迫害的经过。他的邻居中有两人被印度尼西亚右派暴徒杀害，有的被关进监牢。他的一家在被右派暴徒迫得丧失生计而不得不返回祖国时，印度尼西亚反动政府又百般刁难和阻挠，扣留了他家的一些行李，他家后来在侨胞和亲友的资助下才回到了祖国。亲人惨遭印度尼西亚政府杀害的陈盛恩，在会上愤怒地控诉了他父亲陈则源被印度尼西亚右派暴徒活活用棍棒打死的悲惨经过。他说，近一个多月来，印度尼西亚政府又连续对无辜华侨进行了抢劫、殴打、逮捕甚至屠杀，勒令一些地方的华侨限期离开原住地，迫使大批华侨倾家荡产，流离失所。他说，我要警告印度尼西亚政府：你们欠下的血债是一定要偿还的。
    福建省厦门、晋江、龙溪等地区的归国华侨在厦门举行了集会，在会上发言的人们都一致严厉警告印度尼西亚政府必须立即停止对华侨的迫害，并且对中国政府接运受害华侨回国的正当要求迅速作出明确肯定的答复。
