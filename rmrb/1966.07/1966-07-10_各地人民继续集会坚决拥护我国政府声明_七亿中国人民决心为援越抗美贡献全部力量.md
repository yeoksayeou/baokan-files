People across the country continue to hold meetings to strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' new war and aggression of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, resolutely supporting the statement issued by our government on July 3. Many people in medium and small cities also held meetings. The participants pointed out that a powerful socialist China is an insurmountable obstacle to the U.S. imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression. The 700 million Chinese people are ready at any time to contribute all their strength to aid the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression.

In Guangzhou, advanced workers and activists studying Chairman Mao's works from various sectors held a meeting in the afternoon of July 6. Representative Xiao Lanying from the advanced collective, the Second Train Crew of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway, expressed at the meeting that the militia members of this crew would train themselves to be skilled in combat, ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time.

Overseas Chinese who have returned to Guangzhou expressed their most resolute support for the government's statement on July 3. Liu Manxiang, who recently returned from Indonesia, said: The U.S. planes have bombed Hanoi and Haiphong in Vietnam, reaching the China-Vietnam border, and even intruded into our airspace, shooting down our training planes. This shows that the target of U.S. imperialism is aimed at our motherland. Now, the government has issued a stern statement. From this statement, I see the strength of our motherland. Only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can our motherland have such great resolve, daring to fight and daring to win.

People in various medium-sized cities in Guangdong Province have been holding meetings to support the Vietnamese people over the past few days. In Zhanjiang City, workers from the advanced enterprise, Zhanjiang Agricultural Machinery Factory, held a condemnation meeting. Provincial advanced worker Huang Zhiqun held up the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and said, "This is our best weapon to defeat imperialism and modern revisionism. Chairman Mao said, 'All reactionaries are paper tigers.' The U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is just a desperate struggle and will definitely not save them from their failure in Vietnam. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, ready at any time to fight alongside the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors."

In Jinan, representatives of advanced workers from the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Plant held a meeting. Wang Zikai, a representative attending the provincial industrial, transportation, finance, and commerce sector's advanced meeting, said, "We resolutely and unconditionally support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against aggression, no matter what risks we have to take, no matter what sacrifices we have to make, we will not waver." Teachers, students, and staff from Shandong Normal University, Shandong Medical College, and Shandong Institute of Technology also strongly protested against the U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes.

He pointed out that the Chinese people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, do not fear any paper tigers.

Over the past few days, the tide of condemning U.S. imperialism has swept through every corner of the counties under the jurisdiction of Xin County.

In Nanchang, many factories, schools, and people's communes held meetings. Zhao Changsheng, a deputy chief engineer of Jiangxi Tractor Factory and a deputy to the National People's Congress, said at a meeting, "We are ready at any time to contribute our greatest strength to aid our Vietnamese brothers." Teachers, students, and staff from Jiangxi University, Jiangxi Normal University, and Jiangxi Institute of Technology have also been holding meetings to support the Vietnamese people over the past few days.

In Chongqing, Huang Rongchang, deputy chief engineer of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership clique for acting as accomplices to U.S. imperialism, colluding with U.S. imperialism, and playing the big trick of "bombing to force peace," betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people. He said, "This shows that while we oppose U.S. imperialism, we must also oppose Soviet modern revisionism. Only by resolutely opposing Soviet modern revisionism can we smoothly carry out the struggle against U.S. imperialism."

People in Xi'an and some important towns in Shaanxi Province continue to hold meetings. Over the past few days, active learners of Chairman Mao's works, advanced workers, and advanced militiamen from various units of the Weibei Coal Industry Company have held meetings. Feng Yuping, a political instructor of the canteen of Taoyuan Coal Mine, an advanced figure in the national industrial and transportation system, angrily condemned the U.S. imperialists' bandit crimes and tricks of trying to "bomb to force peace." In Yan'an, many old Red Army soldiers, old Red Guards, and old guerrillas severely condemned the U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes of invading Vietnam. At meetings held in various universities in Xi'an, many teachers and students exposed the true face of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, which pretends to be anti-imperialist but actually surrenders, pretends to aid but actually betrays.

In Urumqi, workers from the Xinjiang July 1st Cotton Textile Mill, including 12 ethnic groups such as Uyghur, Kazakh, Han, Hui, Xibe, Uzbek, and Mongol, have been holding meetings over the past few days.

I am a militiaman and have made all preparations, ready to support our closest Vietnamese brothers at any time."

In Hohhot, all teachers, students, and staff of Inner Mongolia University held a meeting to support the Vietnamese people on the morning of August 8. In Baotou, Namusulai, the foreman of the blast furnace of Baogang, expressed his determination to thoroughly smash the political conspiracy of "bombing to force peace" plotted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union in collusion, and resolutely support the Vietnamese people in driving all American aggressors out of Vietnamese territory.

The million liberated serfs in Tibet are extremely angry at the U.S. imperialists' new heinous crimes. Qundain, a female member of the Communist Youth League in Laru Township, Lhasa suburbs, said, "We have been liberated from the dark feudal serf system for a short time, and we will never forget the painful life in the past. We will never allow the U.S. imperialists to impose the cannibalistic system on the Vietnamese people. No matter how crazy the U.S. imperialists are or how hard the revisionists work for them, they will never achieve their goals."

In Shenyang, more than 4,000 revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Liaoning University held meetings on the evening of July 6. Vietnamese students studying in this school also participated in the meeting to condemn the U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes.

At a meeting held by advanced figures, labor models, and representatives from the industrial, financial, commercial, and educational fronts in Harbin, Su Guangming, a worker engineer from Harbin Vehicle Factory and a deputy to the National People's Congress, said, "No matter how crazy the U.S. imperialists are, no matter what tricks they play, and no matter how the Soviet modern revisionists collude with the U.S. imperialists, they will inevitably meet the fate of making trouble, failing, making more trouble, failing again, until they perish, as Chairman Mao said."

In Lanzhou, Ni Shijing and Wang Shenglian, advanced figures in the petroleum industry and workers from Lanzhou Refinery, sternly warned the U.S. imperialists: Your days are numbered, your plan to conquer the world is wrong. At a meeting held by employees of the Lanzhou Coal Construction Company's Ship Gate Market Department, cashier Zhang Guirong expressed her belief that, with the full support of the 700 million people of China and the support of people all over the world, the heroic Vietnamese people will surely achieve final victory, driving all American aggressors out of Vietnamese territory without leaving a single one.
