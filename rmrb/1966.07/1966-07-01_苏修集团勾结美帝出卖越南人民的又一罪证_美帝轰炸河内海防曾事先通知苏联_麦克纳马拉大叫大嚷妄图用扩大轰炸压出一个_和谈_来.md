    The Soviet revisionist group's collusion with the U.S. imperialists to betray the Vietnamese people has another piece of evidence. The U.S. imperialists' airplanes brazenly bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, and the U.S. had informed the Soviet Union of this decision in advance. McNamara shouted loudly, attempting to use the expansion of bombing to force a "negotiation."

    New China News Agency, June 30th: Washington news: U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara and State Department spokesman Wright on the 29th desperately tried to defend the heinous crime of U.S. bandit planes brazenly bombing the urban areas of Hanoi and Haiphong. They also revealed that the U.S. had informed the Soviet Union of the decision to expand the bombing in advance.

    McNamara, at a press conference in Washington, admitted that the decision to bomb the urban areas of Hanoi and Haiphong was made personally by U.S. President Johnson. He described this extremely serious act of "escalating" the war as being done in accordance with the so-called "restraint policy." He also tried to cover up the fact, saying that Hanoi and Haiphong were not bombed, but only the storage facilities around these cities were attacked.

    A reporter asked McNamara if the U.S. had informed the Soviet Union before bombing the urban areas of Hanoi and Haiphong. McNamara did not dare to directly answer this question. However, he emphasized, "I really want to make one last point, which involves our emphasis on moving towards the negotiating table." He shouted, "I cannot emphasize enough how much our government values the victory of ending the fighting in the south, and our willingness to participate in unconditional discussions for this purpose." This clearly shows that the U.S. wants to continue playing the counter-revolutionary two-handed strategy, especially attempting to use the expansion of bombing to force a "negotiation," in order to obtain what it cannot get on the battlefield.

    The same day, State Department spokesman Wright also desperately tried to cover up the serious action of the U.S. expanding the bombing, saying that the U.S. had not "escalated the war."

    Wright hinted that the U.S. had informed the Soviet Union of the decision to expand the bombing. He said, the U.S. had informed "many major relevant governments" of the decision to bomb the urban areas of Hanoi and Haiphong, and the Soviet Union was a "major relevant government." He also said that the U.S. was "continuously in contact" with the Soviet Union and other countries regarding "all aspects of the struggle in Vietnam." Associated Press reporter Ryan confirmed in a report on the 29th, "The new developments in the situation appeared after some cautious consultations between the U.S. and the Soviet bloc countries."

    According to reports from U.S. news agencies, some members of Congress in the U.S. are worried about the consequences of Johnson's government expanding the war. Democratic Senator Morse was worried that Johnson's government bombing the urban areas of Hanoi and Haiphong would further "show the world that the greatest threat to world peace is the U.S." He said, "This shocking, lawless new action will disgrace our country and be remembered by future generations." Republican Senator Javits said that expanding the bombing was "dangerous and risky." Republican Senator Aiken attacked Johnson for "making a mistake." Democratic Senator Robert Kennedy also expressed concern about the "war expanding in this way." Sixteen Democratic representatives also issued a statement expressing concern about Johnson's reckless adventurism.

    苏修集团勾结美帝出卖越南人民的又一罪证
    美帝轰炸河内海防曾事先通知苏联
    麦克纳马拉大叫大嚷妄图用扩大轰炸压出一个“和谈”来
    新华社三十日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部长麦克纳马拉和国务院发言人赖特二十九日竭力为美国强盗飞机悍然轰炸河内和海防市区的滔天罪行狡辩，并且表明美国曾经把扩大轰炸的决定事先通知苏联。
    麦克纳马拉在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上承认，轰炸河内和海防市区的决定是由美国总统约翰逊亲自作出的。他把这个极其严重的战争“升级”行动，说成是根据所谓“克制态度”行事。他还竭力掩饰说，并没有轰炸河内和海防，只是袭击了这些城市周围的储存设施。
    有记者问麦克纳马拉，美国在轰炸河内和海防市区前是否曾通知苏联，麦克纳马拉不敢直接回答这个问题。但是他强调说，“我的确想发表最后一点意见，这涉及我们强调要走向和谈桌子。”他叫嚷说，“对于我国政府非常重视胜利地结束在南方的战斗，以及我们愿意为此目的而参加无条件的讨论，我不论向你们怎么强调也不过分”。这就清楚说明，美国要继续玩弄反革命两手策略，特别是妄图用扩大轰炸的办法压出一个“和谈”来，以便取得它在战场上得不到的东西。
    美国国务院发言人赖特同一天在对记者发表谈话时也竭力掩饰美国扩大轰炸的严重行动，说是“美国没有（把战争）升级”。
    赖特暗示，美国曾经把扩大轰炸的决定告诉苏联。他说，美国曾把轰炸河内和海防市区的决定告诉“许多主要有关的政府”，而苏联是一个“主要有关的政府”。他还说，美国正就“越南的斗争的一切方面”同苏联等国“不断进行接触”。美联社记者瑞安二十九日在一篇报道中进一步证实，“局势的新发展是在美国和苏联集团国家之间进行了一些小心谨慎的洽商以后出现的”。
    据美国通讯社报道，美国国内的一些议员对约翰逊政府扩大战争将招致的后果感到焦虑不安。民主党参议员莫尔斯担心约翰逊政府轰炸河内和海防市区将进一步“向全世界表明，对世界和平的最大威胁原来是美国”。他说，轰炸河内和海防市区“这个令人震惊的、无法无天的新行动将使我们的国家丢脸而一直传到子孙后代”。共和党参议员贾维茨说，扩大轰炸是“危险的、冒风险的”。共和党参议员艾肯攻击约翰逊“犯了一个错误”。民主党参议员罗伯特·肯尼迪也对“战争这样扩大感到不安”。十六名民主党众议员还发表了一个声明，对约翰逊的疯狂冒险行径表示忧虑。
