	We are delighted to learn that the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers to discuss support for the patriotic struggle of the people of South Vietnam is being held in Beijing. On behalf of the people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front, I extend our warmest congratulations to the conference.

	We express our sincere gratitude to the progressive writers of Asia and Africa who have continuously inspired our just struggle. We are deeply moved by your various activities that severely condemn the extremely barbaric war crimes of American imperialism in South Vietnam, expose its deceptive peace talks, and further highlight the justice of our patriotic struggle in South Vietnam, which is filled with hardships and sacrifices but is bound to be victorious.

	With an unyielding resolve to fight until we achieve complete victory, and with your sympathy and support, as well as that of the peace-loving and progressive forces around the world, the people of South Vietnam will surely defeat the American aggressors, no matter how much they escalate the war. The people of South Vietnam will surely complete the glorious task of liberating South Vietnam and reunifying the nation, making an active contribution to the revolutionary cause of the people of Asia, Africa, and the world.

	We wish the conference a complete success.

	Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam Nguyen Huu Tho
