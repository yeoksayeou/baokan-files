Our people will continue to fight against the imperialist forces headed by U.S. imperialism and will spare no effort to oppose modern revisionism and dogmatism, to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and to strive for the victory of the proletarian cause.

We are confident that the combat friendship, unity, and cooperative relations between the peoples of the two countries will continue to be strengthened and developed, and we sincerely wish you and the fraternal Chinese people greater achievements in the struggle for national prosperity and the defense of peace in Asia and the world.
