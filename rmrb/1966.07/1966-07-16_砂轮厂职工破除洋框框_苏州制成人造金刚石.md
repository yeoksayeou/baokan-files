Workers at a grinding wheel factory break free from foreign frameworks: Suzhou produces synthetic diamonds

	Workers at the Suzhou Grinding Wheel Factory in Jiangsu Province have used simple equipment to produce synthetic diamonds, a feat previously thought impossible for a small factory.

	Synthetic diamonds are a new product that has only recently been developed internationally. The production of this product has high technical equipment requirements. Its performance is identical to that of natural diamonds and can be used to grind and process super-hard metals and non-metals, as well as to manufacture drilling tools, among other applications.

	Last year, the Suzhou Grinding Wheel Factory proposed the trial production of synthetic diamonds, but some people thought: only a few countries abroad can produce them, and we, a small factory, definitely cannot. In March of this year, after undergoing socialist education and studying Chairman Mao's works, the workers broke free from their superstitions about foreign frameworks and authorities, greatly boosting their revolutionary spirit. They unanimously proposed: if foreigners can do it, we can too. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's instructions and act according to his directives, we will definitely be able to produce synthetic diamonds.

	Following Chairman Mao's teaching that we must be strategically contemptuous of the enemy but tactically respectful, the workers carefully analyzed the specific conditions and difficulties of producing synthetic diamonds and studied countermeasures. The factory established a three-in-one team consisting of workers, technical personnel, and leading cadres. After forty days of hard work, they overcame one technical difficulty after another, making do with local conditions to create a set of simple production equipment. In this small factory, which was previously thought to be incapable of producing synthetic diamonds, they successfully manufactured synthetic diamonds that meet the required quality standards.

	During the trial production process, the factory received support and cooperation from many scientific research institutions and sister factories.

　　砂轮厂职工破除洋框框
    苏州制成人造金刚石
    江苏省苏州砂轮厂用简易设备制成了人们认为小厂不能生产的人造金刚石。
    人造金刚石是国际上近年来才发展起来的新产品。生产这种产品对技术设备的要求很高。它的性能与天然金刚石完全一样，可用来磨削加工超硬质的金属和非金属材料以及制造钻探工具等。
    去年，苏州砂轮厂曾经提出试制人造金刚石，但有些人认为：国外也只有少数国家能够生产，我们这种小厂根本造不出来。今年三月，职工们经过社会主义教育运动和大学毛主席著作，破除了对洋框框、洋“权威”的迷信，大长无产阶级革命志气，一致提出：人造金刚石外国人能搞，我们也一定能搞。只要我们听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，一定能造出人造金刚石。
    职工们遵照毛主席关于在战略上要藐视敌人，在战术上要重视敌人的教导，认真分析了生产人造金刚石的具体条件和困难，研究了对策。厂内成立了由工人、技术人员和领导干部参加的三结合专业队伍，经过四十天奋战，解决了技术设备上一个接一个的困难，因地制宜地搞成了一套简易生产设备，在这个原来被人们认为不能制造人造金刚石的小厂里，成功地制造出质量符合要求的人造金刚石。
    在试制过程中，这个厂得到许多科学研究单位和兄弟工厂的支援和协作。
