The Chinese people will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, together with the people of Asia, Africa, and the world, make the greatest contribution to the anti-imperialist cause.

The leaders of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and other related friendship associations held a meeting this afternoon to warmly congratulate and support the successful convening of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. They expressed that the Chinese people will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and together with the people of Asia, Africa, and the world, further consolidate and expand the international anti-American united front, and contribute the greatest efforts to the thorough victory of the united struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and the world against imperialism.

All attendees unanimously supported the statement issued by our government on July 3, responded to the urgent call of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people, and expressed their determination to do their utmost to support the great struggle of the Vietnamese people to resist America and save the nation, and to drive the American aggressors out of Vietnam.

Chu Tu-nan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, spoke first. He said that this unprecedentedly grand and historically significant gathering of Asian and African writers is a great victory for the Asian and African peoples in smashing the imperialist and its accomplices' plot of division. He said that a worldwide anti-American revolutionary storm will definitely rise in the Asian and African regions and the world. The revolutionary torrent of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism is unstoppable by any force.

Chu Tu-nan strongly condemned the recent outrageous bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by American imperialism and the betrayal of the Vietnamese people by the Soviet revisionist leadership in collusion with the Americans. He said that the Chinese people have long been prepared to pay any price and, together with the people of Asia, Africa, and the world, fully support the struggle of the Vietnamese people.

Chu Tu-nan said that at this Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, many representatives expressed their boundless love and admiration for Chairman Mao in vivid language, which shows that the Asian and African peoples and the people of the world sincerely believe in Mao Zedong Thought. He said that the great Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon of the Chinese and world revolution, and it will definitely shine more and more brilliantly in the great cause of smashing the old world and building a new world.

Sun Xiaoquan, Vice President of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association, pointed out that the recent heinous crime of the American imperialists bombing Hanoi and Haiphong has aroused the extreme indignation of the people of the world, while the Soviet revisionist leadership has further played the shameful role of accomplice to the Americans in this new adventure. The statement of our government reflects the iron will of 700 million Chinese people to aid Vietnam and resist America, embodies the lofty proletarian internationalism of the Chinese people, and we will do everything possible to aid the Vietnamese people and contribute all our efforts to the complete defeat of the American aggressors.

Ding Xilin, Vice President of the China-Africa Friendship Association, pointed out in his speech that in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States, revolutionary Asian and African writers are at the forefront of the battle. In the creation of a new Asian and African culture that is anti-imperialist, revolutionary, and brilliant, Asian and African writers will definitely complete their glorious historical mission. Asian and African writers will further strengthen their fighting cooperation in the common struggle against imperialism.

Wu Heng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, said that this Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers will be recorded in history as a new victory for the united struggle of contemporary Asian and African peoples against imperialism. This conference once again proves that the struggle of the peoples of Asian and African countries against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States is unstoppable and unbreakable by any force. The Chinese people will always stand shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa and fight to the end, no matter what the circumstances.

Hu Yuzhi, Vice President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, emphasized that the successful convening of this Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers is a heavy blow to American imperialism and its lackeys, and it will make significant contributions to the united struggle of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism. He pointed out that the reactionary reverse current of anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-China stirred up by the American imperialists supporting the Indonesian reactionaries is only a temporary phenomenon. The crimes committed by American imperialism around the world will ultimately be settled.

Lu Jun, President of the China-Iraq Friendship Association, said in his speech that at this Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, many representatives expressed their boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and their boundless belief in the great Mao Zedong Thought, which shows that Mao Zedong Thought is not only the greatest wealth of the Chinese people but also the common wealth of the people of the world. As more and more revolutionary people of the world grasp Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed and exploited peoples of the world will definitely flourish more vigorously and achieve more brilliant victories.

Zhang Jie, Vice President of the China-Pakistan Friendship Association, stressed that no matter how high the American imperialists escalate the war or how great the price to pay, the Chinese people will fully support the struggle of the Vietnamese people. He also expressed that the Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Pakistani people to oppose foreign aggression and safeguard national independence, and firmly support the just struggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination.

Zhao Anbo, Secretary-General of the China-Japan Friendship Association, said that the Soviet revisionist leadership's sabotage of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers once again exposed their ugly face of sabotaging the anti-imperialist revolutionary movement of the Asian and African peoples, and exposed them as accomplices of American imperialism and traitors to the revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples. He said that on the Vietnamese issue, the Soviet revisionist leadership is doing its utmost to serve Johnson's "peace talks" plot, attempting to bring the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist America and save the nation into the "Sino-Soviet cooperation" track. Their evil deeds of being willing to be accomplices of American imperialism have been condemned by the people of the world. Zhao Anbo pointed out that the plots of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries to sabotage the united struggle of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism will never succeed, and the anti-imperialist revolutionary storm of the Asian and African peoples is unstoppable by anyone.

Wang Kunlun, Vice President of the China-Cambodia Friendship Association, praised the support of the Cambodian government and people for this Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. He said that the American imperialists, together with their lackeys, have repeatedly carried out military provocations and subversive sabotage activities against Cambodia, and the Cambodian people have resolutely fought back. We fully support the just struggle of the Cambodian government and people.

Cui Yitian, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, pointed out in his speech that a new anti-American revolutionary storm is currently forming in the world. The American imperialists and their lackeys' delusion of enslaving the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world will definitely be smashed in this storm.

Dian Xiuqian, member of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association and secretary of the National Women's Federation, said that the convening of this Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers is a new victory in further strengthening the unity of the 2 billion people and women of Asia and Africa in the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause. Millions of Chinese women will forever stand with the anti-imperialist revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa, and completely, thoroughly, and cleanly eliminate the imperialist and old and new colonialist forces of aggression in the Asian and African regions.

    我对外友协等团体负责人集会热烈支持亚非作家紧急会议
    新华社五日讯　中国人民对外文化友好协会和其他有关对外友好协会的负责人，今天下午举行集会，热烈祝贺和支持亚非作家紧急会议的胜利召开。他们表示，中国人民一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同亚非人民和全世界人民一道，进一步巩固和扩大国际反美统一战线，为亚非人民和全世界人民团结反帝事业的彻底胜利贡献出最大的力量。
    全体与会者一致拥护我国政府七月三日的声明，响应亚非作家紧急会议的支援越南人民斗争的紧急呼吁，表示要竭尽全力支援越南人民伟大的抗美救国斗争，把美国侵略者从越南赶出去。
    中国人民对外文化友好协会会长楚图南首先发言。他说，这次规模空前盛大、具有深远历史意义的亚非作家大集会，是亚非人民粉碎帝国主义及其帮凶分裂阴谋取得伟大胜利的大集会。他说，一个席卷全世界的反美革命大风暴必将在亚非地区和全世界兴起。亚非人民反帝革命斗争的洪流是任何力量也阻挡不了的。
    楚图南强烈谴责美帝国主义最近悍然轰炸河内、海防，苏联修正主义领导集团勾结美帝出卖越南人民的罪行。他说，中国人民早已做好准备，不惜付出一切代价，同亚非和世界人民一道，全力支援越南人民的斗争。
    楚图南说，在这次亚非作家紧急会议上，许多代表以生动的语言表达了对毛主席的无限热爱和无限敬佩，这说明亚非人民和全世界人民无比真诚地信仰毛泽东思想。他说，伟大的毛泽东思想是中国和世界革命的灯塔，它必将在打碎旧世界、建立新世界的伟大事业中放射出越来越灿烂的光辉。
    中国越南友好协会副会长孙晓村指出，美帝国主义最近轰炸河内和海防的滔天罪行，激起了全世界人民的无比愤怒，而苏联修正主义领导集团在美帝这一新的冒险行动中进一步充当了可耻的帮凶，他们的手段是极其卑鄙的。我国政府的声明反映了七亿中国人民援越抗美的钢铁意志，体现了中国人民崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神，我们将尽一切可能援助越南人民，为彻底打败美国侵略者贡献出自己的全部力量。
    中非友好协会副会长丁西林在发言中指出，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争中，革命的亚非作家站在斗争的行列里冲锋陷阵。在创造反帝革命的、人民大众的、民族的、光辉灿烂的亚非新文化的事业中，亚非作家也必将胜利地完成其光荣的历史使命。亚非作家在反帝革命的共同斗争中必将进一步加强战斗的合作。
    对外文化友好协会副会长武衡说，这次亚非作家紧急会议将以当代亚非人民团结反帝事业的一次新胜利而载入史册。这次会议再一次证明，亚非各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，是任何力量也阻挡不了的，是任何人也破坏不了的。中国人民无论在什么情况下，永远同亚非革命人民并肩战斗到底。
    中国印度尼西亚友好协会副会长胡愈之强调指出，这次亚非作家紧急会议的胜利召开，是对美帝国主义及其走狗的一次沉重打击，它必将为亚非人民的团结反帝事业作出重大贡献。他指出，美帝国主义支持印度尼西亚反动派掀起一股反共、反人民、反对新中国的反动逆流，这只是暂时的现象。美帝国主义在世界各地所犯下的罪行，最终将被清算。
    中国伊拉克友好协会会长罗俊在发言中说，在这次亚非作家紧急会议上，许多代表无限热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席，无限信仰伟大的毛泽东思想，这说明毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民的最大财富，也是世界人民的共同财富。随着越来越多的世界革命人民掌握了毛泽东思想，全世界被压迫、被剥削人民的革命斗争必将更加蓬勃地展开，取得更加辉煌的胜利。
    中国巴基斯坦友好协会副会长张杰强调说，不管美帝国主义把战争升到那一级，也不管要付出多大代价，中国人民都全力以赴地坚决支援越南人民的斗争。他还表示，中国人民坚决支持巴基斯坦人民反对外国侵略、保卫民族独立的正义斗争，坚决支持克什米尔人民争取自决权利的正义斗争。
    中日友好协会秘书长赵安博说，苏联修正主义领导集团这次破坏亚非作家紧急会议的分裂行为，再一次暴露了他们破坏亚非人民反帝革命运动的丑恶面目，暴露了他们是美帝国主义的帮凶和亚非人民革命事业的叛徒。他说，在越南问题上，苏联修正主义领导集团极力为约翰逊的“和谈”阴谋效劳，妄图把越南人民的抗美救国斗争纳入“苏美合作”的轨道，他们这种甘愿为美帝帮凶的罪恶行为遭到了全世界人民的谴责。赵安博指出，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派妄想破坏亚非团结反帝事业的阴谋是永远不会得逞的，亚非人民的反帝革命风暴是任何人也阻挡不了的。
    中国柬埔寨友好协会副会长王昆仑，在发言中赞扬了柬埔寨政府和人民对这次亚非作家紧急会议的支持。他说，美帝国主义一再伙同它的仆从对柬埔寨进行军事挑衅和颠覆破坏活动，柬埔寨人民坚决地进行了反击，我们完全支持柬埔寨政府和人民的正义斗争。
    对外文化友好协会副会长崔义田在发言中指出，当前国际上一个新的反美革命风暴正在形成。美帝国主义及其走狗企图奴役亚非人民和世界各国人民的痴心妄想，必将在这场风暴中被砸得粉碎。
    中越友协理事、全国妇联书记处书记田秀涓说，这次亚非作家紧急会议的召开，是亚非二十亿人民和妇女在反帝革命事业中进一步加强团结的新胜利。亿万中国妇女将永远同反帝革命的亚非人民站在一起，把帝国主义和新老殖民主义在亚非地区的侵略势力全部、彻底、干净地消灭掉。
