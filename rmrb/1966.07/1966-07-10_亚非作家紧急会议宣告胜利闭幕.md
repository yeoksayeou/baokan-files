The emergency conference of Asian and African writers has concluded successfully.

The conference, held in Beijing, was a resounding success, with a strong anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist message. It was a significant milestone in the Asian and African writers' movement, marking a new chapter in their struggle for unity and resistance against imperialism.

The closing ceremony was held at the Great Hall of the People. Over 10,000 people from various sectors of Beijing attended to celebrate the event. They joined the writers from Asian and African countries in celebrating the great victory of the Asian and African peoples' united struggle against imperialism. The conference was a historic success, marking a significant moment in the Asian and African writers' movement.

Present at the ceremony were Chen Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Chinese delegation, Lin Feng, Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, and other relevant officials and foreign friends in Beijing.

The conference lasted for thirteen days. Before and during the conference, imperialists and Soviet revisionists attempted to sabotage and disrupt the event. However, representatives from 53 Asian and African countries and regions overcame these obstacles to attend the conference in Beijing. They responded to division with unity and to sabotage with struggle, thoroughly refuting the imperialists' and their accomplices' claim that the "concept of Asian and African unity has perished." Guo Moruo, in his closing speech, emphasized that the conference not only expressed the firm resolve of Asian and African writers and peoples to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation but also demonstrated the unity of Asian and African writers and peoples in opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism. He pointed out that the anti-imperialist unity of the 2 billion people of Asia and Africa has not perished but, through this conference, has shown itself to be more important, more consolidated, and more expansive than ever.

At the closing ceremony, representatives from various countries joined the people of Beijing in a atmosphere of anti-imperialism, revolution, struggle, and unity. Representatives read out a series of resolutions passed by the emergency conference. Some representatives, while reading the resolutions, enthusiastically paid tribute to "the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong!" Others shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong! Ten thousand times, ten thousand times!" The high level of friendship and revolutionary fervor displayed by the representatives from various countries sparked prolonged, thunderous applause from the entire audience.

The Great Hall of the People was decorated with great solemnity. The emblem of the emergency conference of Asian and African writers hung in the center of the stage curtain, flanked by eight red flags. On the red banner hanging opposite the stage, the words "Long live the great unity of the people of the world!" and "Long live the great unity of Asian and African writers!" were written in Chinese, Arabic, English, and French.

In the morning, representatives from various countries, international organizations' observers, and people from various sectors of Beijing entered the Great Hall of the People to the tunes of "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China," "The Ship of State Needs a Helmsman," and "Socialism Is Good."

When Chen Yi, Vice Premier, and others escorted the heads of delegations from various countries, the chief observers of international organizations, and special invitees onto the stage, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly. Young Pioneers ran onto the stage to present flowers to the guests from various countries.

The secretary-general of the emergency conference of Asian and African writers, Manuwila, presided over the closing ceremony and delivered a speech. He said that the revolutionary writers of Asia and Africa had achieved a true and great victory at this conference. This victory was the victory of the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle, the victory of the Asian and African peoples' struggle for national liberation, and the victory of all revolutionary peoples of the world. He said that although the representatives from 53 countries and regions and the observers from five international organizations spoke different languages, when they expressed their determination to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, to support the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asian and African countries, and to condemn the splitters, they had a common language, which was the language of revolutionaries.

Manuwila said that this historic conference was held under the sabotage of those notorious splitters. They had plotted the illegal decisions of the so-called Standing Committee and used the most despicable tricks to sabotage our conference. But they failed. He concluded by saying that the Chinese people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, stood at the forefront of the world revolution, and it was in this historic city, the capital of the Chinese people, that we created history and achieved this great victory among the brave Chinese people.

After Manuwila's speech, he and the representatives read out the conference statement and the 37 resolutions passed at the plenary session that morning regarding support for the Vietnamese people and the peoples of Asian and African countries in their struggle against imperialism led by the United States and for the maintenance of national independence. (The full text of the statement and resolutions is published on pages 5 to 9.)

The ceremony also read a congratulatory telegram from Guinea's President Sekou Toure.

Guo Moruo then delivered the closing speech. He first expressed his heartfelt congratulations on the successful conclusion of the conference. He said that the 2 billion people of Asia and Africa demanded strengthened unity to carry out the just struggle against imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys to the end, generation after generation, bravely advancing. This is the trend of the times. It is unstoppable by any force and unbreakable by any force. He pointed out that the recent American bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong was the product of the dirty political dealings between the United States and the Soviet Union. The black curtain of their collusion in the Vietnamese issue has been exposed once again. One bombs from the air, and the other pulls from the ground, bombing and pulling, all for the evil purpose of "bombing to force peace." This is another great exposure of the face of American imperialist aggression and another great exposure of the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

Guo Moruo said that the historical mission of the peoples of Asia and Africa is to consolidate and expand the international united front against American imperialism and its lackeys. He said that the conference, in the spirit of mutual understanding and accommodation, reached a consensus. This further strengthened the unity of Asian and African writers and peoples, marking the liberation movement of Asian and African writers and peoples as developing more healthily on a broader path.

Guo Moruo said that the conference had decided that the Third Asian and African Writers' Conference would be held in China in 1967. Chinese writers and the Chinese people would definitely make every effort to prepare for the next conference. He welcomed more Asian and African writers to come to China enthusiastically next year.

The closing ceremony ended to the majestic tune of the "Anti-Imperialist March." At this moment, the venue was filled with joy, friendship, and victory. Rhythmic applause echoed throughout the venue. On the stage, Chen Yi, Vice Premier, and representatives and observers from various countries held hands and linked arms, demonstrating the fighting camaraderie between the peoples of Asian and African countries. The representatives also shook hands warmly, embraced each other, and congratulated each other on the success of the conference, wishing the peoples of various countries to achieve greater victories. At this moment, the entire audience sang "The Internationale" loudly. Chen Van Thien, head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China, Kounine Bounsena, President of the Lao Women's Union, Paron Chularat, representative of the Thai Patriotic Front abroad, Galib, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Beijing, and other foreign guests in Beijing were invited to attend the closing ceremony.

The emergency conference of Asian and African writers held a plenary session this morning. The plenary session produced all the results of this emergency conference.

After Chairman Guo Moruo announced the opening of the meeting, Secretary-General Manuwila of the emergency conference of Asian and African writers read the conference statement (draft). The entire audience stood up and passed the conference statement with warm applause.

The conference passed a resolution firmly supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and 37 resolutions firmly supporting the peoples of Asian and African countries in their struggle against imperialism led by the United States and old and new colonialism, and for the maintenance of national independence.

    亚非人民团结反帝的新胜利　亚非作家运动的新里程碑
    亚非作家紧急会议宣告胜利闭幕
    首都各界一万多人到会祝贺，陈毅副总理等出席，会场充满反帝、革命、战斗、团结的气氛  曼努维拉讲话并和代表分别宣读会议公报和决议，郭沫若致闭幕词  代表们热情地向中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席致敬，高呼毛泽东万岁万万岁
    新华社九日讯　亚非作家紧急会议今天宣告胜利闭幕。这次盛况空前的亚非作家大集会，发出了反帝反殖的强烈呼声，是一次声讨世界人民共同敌人美帝国主义的胜利大会，为亚非作家运动树立了一个新的里程碑。
    会议在人民大会堂举行了隆重的闭幕式。首都各界一万多人前来祝贺，他们同亚非各国作家一起，热烈欢呼亚非人民团结反帝事业的伟大胜利，欢呼这个在亚非作家运动中具有重大历史意义的盛会圆满成功。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国代表团团长、亚非作家紧急会议主席郭沫若，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长林枫、刘宁一，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志，以及中国有关方面负责人和在北京的许多外国朋友，出席了闭幕式。
    这次紧急会议历时十三天。在紧急会议前夕和会议期间，帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者曾经进行了种种阻挠和破坏，可是，五十三个亚非国家和地区的代表仍冲破障碍前来北京，他们以团结回答了分裂，以战斗回答了破坏，彻底粉碎了帝国主义及其帮凶宣扬的“亚非团结概念已经灭亡”的谰言。郭沫若在闭幕式上致词时强调说：这次会议既表达了亚非作家和亚非人民坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的巨大决心，也表达了亚非作家和亚非人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的团结精神。他指出，亚非二十亿人民的反帝团结不仅没有灭亡，而且通过这次会议显示了它比任何时候都更加重要，更加巩固，更加扩大了。
    在今天的闭幕式上，各国作家同首都人民济济一堂，会场上充满了反帝、革命、战斗、团结的气氛。各国代表以激昂的声音在会上宣读了紧急会议通过的一系列决议。有的代表在宣读决议时，热情地“向中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志致以热烈的、兄弟般的敬礼！”有的代表高呼：“毛泽东万岁！万万岁！”各国朋友所表现的崇高友谊和革命的激情，在全场激起了长时间的雷鸣般的掌声。
    今天人民大会堂布置得分外庄严隆重。主席台帷幕的正中悬挂着亚非作家紧急会议的会徽，会徽两旁排列着八面红旗。主席台对面挂的红色横幅上，用中文、阿拉伯文、英文和法文写着：“全世界人民大团结万岁！”“亚非作家大团结万岁！”
    上午九时多，各国代表和国际组织的观察员以及首都各界群众，在《没有共产党就没有新中国》、《大海航行靠舵手》和《社会主义好》的歌声中，陆续走进人民大会堂。
    当陈毅副总理等陪同各国代表团团长、各国际组织首席观察员和特邀来宾走上主席台时，全场起立，热烈鼓掌。少先队员跑上主席台向各国来宾献花。
    亚非作家紧急会议秘书长曼努维拉主持闭幕式并在会上讲了话。他说，我们亚非两大洲的革命作家，在这次会议上取得了真正的巨大的胜利。这次胜利，是越南人民英勇斗争的胜利，是亚非人民争取民族解放斗争的胜利，是全世界革命人民的胜利。他说，我们来自五十三个国家和地区的代表和五个国际组织的观察员，尽管有各种不同的语言，但是当我们表示决心支持越南人民抗美救国斗争，支持亚非各国人民民族解放斗争，决心谴责分裂主义者的时候，我们就有了共同的语言，这就是革命者的语言。
    曼努维拉说，我们这个历史性的会议，是在那些臭名昭彰的分裂主义者破坏的情况下开始的，他们一手策划的伪常设局会议作出了非法的决定，采用了最卑鄙的伎俩来破坏我们的会议。但是他们失败了。他最后说，中国人民在毛泽东思想的指引下，站在世界革命的最前列，而我们正是在这个具有历史意义的城市——中国人民的首都北京创造了历史，在勇敢的中国人民中取得了这次巨大的胜利。
    曼努维拉讲话以后，随即由他和各国代表在闭幕式上宣读了于今天早晨在全体会议上通过的亚非作家紧急会议公报，以及关于支持越南人民和亚非各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义，争取和维护民族独立斗争等三十七个决议。（公报和决议全文登在五至九版）
    会上还宣读了几内亚总统塞古·杜尔给这次会议的贺电。
    接着郭沫若致闭幕词。他首先衷心地为会议的圆满成功表示热烈的祝贺。他说，亚非二十亿人民要求加强团结，把反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的正义斗争进行到底，前赴后继，勇往直前，这是时代的主流。这是任何力量所阻挡不住的，也是任何力量所分裂不了的。他指出，美帝国主义最近轰炸河内和海防，是美苏进行肮脏的政治交易的产物。美苏在越南问题上狼狈为奸的黑幕又一次暴露出来了。他们一个在空中炸，一个在地上拉，一炸一拉，都是为了实现“以炸迫和”的罪恶目的。这是美帝国主义侵略面目的又一次大暴露，是苏联修正主义领导集团叛徒面目的又一次大暴露。
    郭沫若说，亚非人民的历史使命就是要巩固和扩大反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线。他说，这次会议本着互谅互让的精神，达成了一致的协议。这就进一步加强了亚非作家和亚非人民的团结，标志着亚非作家和亚非人民的解放运动是在更宽阔的道路上更加健康地向前发展。
    郭沫若说，会议已经作出决议，第三届亚非作家大会将于一九六七年在中国召开。中国作家和中国人民一定要作出最大的努力，把下一届大会的准备工作切实地做好。他表示欢迎明年有更多的亚非作家们踊跃地来到中国。
    闭幕式最后在雄壮的《反帝进行曲》的乐曲声中结束。这时，会场洋溢着欢乐、友好、胜利的气氛。有节奏的掌声响彻全场。主席台上，陈毅副总理以及各国代表和观察员等手拉着手，臂挽着臂，显示了亚非各国人民之间的战斗情谊。代表们还亲切握手，热烈拥抱，互相祝贺这次会议的成功，祝贺各国人民从胜利走向更大的胜利。这时，全场群众高声唱起《全世界无产者联合起来》。越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长陈文成，老挝妇女联合会主席贵宁·奔舍那夫人，泰国爱国阵线驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖，巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处主任加尔布，和在北京的其他国家的外宾，应邀出席了闭幕式。
