The first half of the year saw a significant increase in the production of major products at the Luoyang Tractor Factory, a reduction in costs, and the introduction of more new products than in any previous year. Some products have reached the advanced levels of both domestic and international standards.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Zhengzhou, July 7th: In the first year of China's third Five-Year Plan, the workers of the Luoyang First Tractor Manufacturing Factory launched an unprecedented widespread movement to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, resulting in a remarkable change in their spiritual outlook. The workers, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, denouncing and criticizing the anti-party, anti-socialist clique, while also exerting their maximum revolutionary enthusiasm and intelligence to shoulder the heavy burden of revolution and strive to complete the production tasks assigned by the state. The production situation has been improving day by day.

In the first six months of this year, the factory's total output value has increased significantly compared to the same period last year. Major products such as tractors, tractor parts, and various irrigation equipment have seen a substantial increase in production, with some products doubling in output. The workers, while working in the factory, have the interests of five hundred million farmers at heart. Despite the continuous reduction in the cost per tractor, the cost per unit this year has decreased by more than one thousand yuan compared to the same period last year. The mass technological innovation and technological revolution have been unprecedentedly active. This year, the number of new products successfully developed and put into production has been more than in any previous year, with some products reaching the advanced levels of both domestic and international standards.

The facts once again prove: production relies on people, people rely on ideology, and people's ideology relies on being armed with Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, people become the smartest and bravest; with people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, any difficulty can be overcome, and any miracle can be created.

The Luoyang Tractor Factory is a modern large-scale factory with good equipment and technical conditions. Therefore, in the past, many leaders and workers have long been burdened by the good conditions and dared not revolutionize boldly. Last year, the factory carried out a socialist education movement, and this year, it launched a widespread movement to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. The class consciousness of the workers has been greatly enhanced, and their minds have been liberated. They say: good equipment and good technology are favorable conditions for doing a good job in production; however, conditions are dead, while people are alive, and conditions are created by people. In the production struggle, the decisive factor is people. In the great debate on the relationship between politics and business, the workers listed a large number of facts, criticizing the past erroneous ideas and practices of emphasizing business over politics and seeing things but not people. Through actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, they have changed their spiritual outlook, undertaken more arduous production tasks than last year, and launched a production high tide throughout the factory. They say: with Mao Zedong Thought in our hearts, we dare to take on any difficulty.

Daring to struggle, daring to win, daring to break the bourgeois "old calendar," daring to break the revisionist foreign frameworks, and daring to catch up with and surpass the advanced scientific and technological levels of the world, these are the distinctive features of the production high tide at the Luoyang Tractor Factory this year. The plunger-type oil pump produced by this factory is designed by foreigners, weighing more than thirty kilograms, with an outdated structure, high fuel consumption, and low efficiency, far from meeting the needs of tractor production technology development. Some technical "authorities" then proposed spending tens of millions of yuan to buy foreign patents. This proposal was strongly opposed by the workers. The workers decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, be self-reliant, and strive for strength, creating conditions and forging ahead with their own hands. They used "On Practice" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" as weapons, fearing neither "authorities" nor ghosts, repeatedly conducting seventeen experiments, and in the process of experimentation, repeatedly studied "On Practice" seventeen times. Finally, they successfully developed the Chinese-style hydraulic governor distribution oil pump. This oil pump has a simple structure, low fuel consumption, good performance, and weighs only 3.5 kilograms, reaching the advanced level of the world. The foundry sand used by the Luoyang Tractor Factory was previously transported from Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and Hunan over thousands of miles to Luoyang. Why transport sand from thousands of miles away? The workers indignantly said: "This is the revisionists tormenting us, the 'tightening ring' that the foreign 'authorities' put on our heads." After the socialist education movement, the workers actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, seeking truth from practice, and boldly tried using Kaifeng sand (containing 80% silicon). The experimental results showed that Kaifeng sand is of better quality than sand from other places. In summarizing their experience, the workers said: the revisionist foreign frameworks must be thoroughly broken from head to toe.

The leaders of the Luoyang Tractor Factory increasingly recognize that leadership work must emphasize politics and rely on the masses. The frame of the "Dongfanghong 54" tractor is a piece of junk designed by revisionists, with low strength and short life. This has been a long-standing "difficult problem" that the Luoyang Tractor Factory has not been able to solve since it started production. The workers have long wanted to overthrow this frame, but a few bourgeois technical "authorities" proposed that producing a new frame was uncertain and would cost tens of millions of yuan, requiring a three-month halt in production, etc. Therefore, the reform has been delayed for five years. After the socialist education movement, the factory leadership firmly believed in the masses and relied on the masses, handing over the task of developing a new frame to the workers. The workers read Chairman Mao's books and armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, completing the development of the new frame and putting it into production in just twenty-six days, spending only over two hundred yuan.

### 活学活用毛主席思想　大破洋框框大创新条件  洛阳拖拉机厂生产面貌一新  上半年主要产品大幅度增产，成本下降，新产品比以往任何一年都多，有些产品赶上了国内外先进水平

    活学活用毛主席思想　大破洋框框大创新条件
    洛阳拖拉机厂生产面貌一新
    上半年主要产品大幅度增产，成本下降，新产品比以往任何一年都多，有些产品赶上了国内外先进水平
    据新华社郑州七日电　在我国第三个五年计划的第一年，洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂的广大职工掀起了空前广泛的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，精神面貌发生了显著变化。职工们满怀革命豪情，一面积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，口诛笔伐，痛击反党反社会主义黑帮；一面发挥最大的革命干劲和聪明才智，勇挑革命重担，努力完成国家交给他们的生产任务，生产面貌日新月异。
    今年前六个月，这个厂的总产值比去年同期增长很多，主要产品拖拉机、拖拉机配件及各种排灌设备，都大幅度增产，有的成倍地增长。职工们身在工厂，心怀五亿农民，拖拉机单台成本在连年下降情况下，今年上半年又比去年同期下降一千多元。群众性的技术革新和技术革命空前活跃，今年以来试制成功和投入生产的新产品比以往任何一年都多，有些产品赶上了国内外先进水平。
    事实再一次证明：生产靠人，人靠思想，人的思想靠毛泽东思想武装。有了毛泽东思想，人就变得最聪明、最勇敢；有了毛泽东思想武装起来的人，什么困难都可以克服，什么奇迹都可以创造出来。
    洛阳拖拉机厂是一座现代化的大工厂，设备条件好，技术条件好。因此，过去不少领导干部和职工，长期背着条件好的包袱，不敢大胆革命。去年，这个厂进行了社会主义教育运动，今年又广泛掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，广大职工阶级觉悟大提高，思想大解放，他们说：设备好，技术好，是搞好生产的有利条件；但是，条件是死的，人是活的，条件是靠人来创造的，在生产斗争中，起决定作用的是人。广大职工在政治和业务的关系的大辩论中，列举大量事实，批判了过去轻政治、重业务，见物不见人的错误思想和作法。他们通过活学活用毛主席著作，改变了精神面貌，承担了比去年更加繁重的生产任务，在全厂掀起了生产高潮。他们说：我们心里有了毛泽东思想，就是再大的困难也敢担。
    敢于斗争，敢于胜利，敢于打破资产阶级的“老黄历”，打破修正主义的洋框框，敢于赶超世界先进科学技术水平，这是今年洛阳拖拉机厂生产高潮中的鲜明特色。这个厂生产的柱塞式油泵，是外国设计的，重三十多公斤，结构陈旧，耗油多，效率低，远不能满足拖拉机生产技术发展的需要。有的技术“权威”于是提出，拿几十万块钱去买外国的专利。这一主张遭到工人的坚决反对。工人们决心遵照毛主席的教导，自力更生，奋发图强，用自己的双手创出条件来，闯出道路来。他们以《实践论》、《愚公移山》为武器，不怕“权威”，不怕鬼，反复进行了十七次试验，在试验过程中反复学习了十七遍《实践论》，终于试制成功了中国式液压调速分配式油泵。这种油泵结构简单，耗油少，性能良好，只有三点五公斤重，已达到世界先进水平。洛阳拖拉机厂用的型砂，过去一向是从东北、内蒙古、湖南千里迢迢运到洛阳的。为什么要从千里之外运砂呢？职工们气愤地说：“这是修正主义者整我们，是‘洋权威’给我们戴在头上的‘紧箍咒’。”在社会主义教育运动之后，广大职工活学活用毛主席著作，从实践中找真理，大胆试用开封砂（含硅量百分之八十）。试验的结果表明，开封砂比外地砂质量更好。职工们在总结经验时说：修正主义的洋框框必须从头到脚彻底破。
    洛阳拖拉机厂的领导干部越来越认识到，领导工作必须突出政治，依靠群众。“东方红五十四”拖拉机的车架，是修正主义设计的破烂货，强度低，寿命短。这是洛阳拖拉机厂开工生产以来一直没有解决的“老大难”问题。工人们早就想革掉这种车架的命，可是，少数资产阶级技术“权威”却提出什么生产新车架没有把握，要花几十万元，停产三个月等等，因此一直拖了五年没有进行改革。社会主义教育运动以后，工厂领导坚决相信群众，依靠群众，把试制新车架的工作放手交给工人。工人们读了毛主席的书，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，只用了二十六天时间，花了二百多元，就制成了新车架并投入生产。
