The Chinese People's Liberation Army General Staff Department and General Political Department held a report meeting this afternoon to warmly celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army.

Albanian Charge d'Affaires Melechi Babani was invited to give a long report at the meeting.

Chinese People's Liberation Army Vice Chief of the General Staff Wang Xinting and Deputy Director of the General Political Department Yuan Ziqin attended the meeting. At the meeting, Yuan Ziqin spoke first, representing the entire PLA in extending warm festive greetings to all comrades of the fraternal Albanian People's Army. He enthusiastically praised the brilliant achievements made by the Albanian People's Army in the path of revolutionary army building under the wise leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Melechi Babani, in his report, introduced the glorious fighting history of the Albanian People's Army. He said that our army was able to defeat powerful enemies because it came from the people, was closely linked with the people, fought for the interests of the motherland, was armed with lofty Marxism-Leninism, was under the leadership of the glorious Labor Party and the famous commander Comrade Enver Hoxha, and was a political army. He said that recently, the Albanian Labor Party has made a series of important decisions in the military field, deciding to abolish military ranks and establish a system of political commissars and party committees. These revolutionary and far-sighted decisions have aroused unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm in the troops.

Babani strongly condemned the crimes of American imperialism in expanding the aggression in Vietnam. He said that the recent bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by American bandits shows the nature of American imperialism's open armed aggression against the entire Vietnam. The Khrushchev revisionist clique directly and indirectly supports American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, and their betrayal is like firing a cold arrow at the fraternal Vietnamese people. We must do everything possible to support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against American imperialism. He pointed out that the attitude towards the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people is a touchstone of whether one is revolutionary or counter-revolutionary. Today, there is no third way. Either one supports the revolution and openly aids the Vietnamese people, or one supports counter-revolution and supports American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam.

After enthusiastically praising the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong in all fields, Babani said in his report that after Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, a great leader, a great Marxist-Leninist, and a true theoretical guide, Comrade Mao Zedong, has emerged. This is a great fortune for Marxist-Leninists all over the world.

Babani also enthusiastically praised the great achievements made by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in emphasizing politics and actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. He also highly evaluated the friendship and unity between the peoples and armies of the two countries, China and Albania.

After Babani's report, Yuan Ziqin gave a speech of thanks, expressing gratitude for his introduction of the glorious fighting history and valuable military-building experience of the fraternal Albanian People's Army.

Yuan Ziqin strongly condemned the crimes of American imperialism in bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, and angrily denounced the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique for shamelessly colluding with the United States, continuing to play tricks of false support and true betrayal on the Vietnamese issue, and taking the opportunity to fiercely attack China. He said that on July 3, our government issued a solemn statement, strongly condemning the savage crimes of American imperialism. This statement fully expresses the will of the entire Chinese people. We, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, firmly support it and have made full preparations. American imperialism has no limits in expanding the war in Vietnam, and we have no limits in aiding Vietnam and resisting America. If American imperialism dares to bring the war to the Chinese people, then, no matter how it comes, no matter how many it comes with, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate it.

Babani's report and Yuan Ziqin's speech both received thunderous applause from the audience.

Those who attended the report meeting today also included responsible officials such as Pan Zhenwu, He Liu, Mao Hongxiang, Wang Pingshui, Shang Siguang, Lin Bin, Zhang Guochuan, and Zhang Zhengguang.

Albanian Charge d'Affaires Commercial First Secretary Kasim Shapllo also attended the meeting.

After the meeting, a documentary film "Long Live Revolutionary Friendship" about Comrade Shehu's visit to China was shown.

    解放军总参谋部和总政治部举行报告会
    巴巴尼临时代办热烈赞扬中国人民解放军活学活用毛主席著作取得巨大成果  总政治部副主任袁子钦盛赞阿人民军在革命化建军的道路上取得的光辉成就
    新华社八日讯　中国人民解放军总参谋部、总政治部今天下午举行报告会，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军二十三周年。
    阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使馆临时代办梅莱契·巴巴尼应邀在会上作了长篇报告。
    中国人民解放军副总参谋长王新亭、总政治部副主任袁子钦出席了报告会。在报告会上，袁子钦首先致词，代表中国人民解放军全体指战员向兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民军全体同志，致以热烈的节日祝贺。他热烈赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民军在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志的英明领导下，在革命化建军的道路上取得的光辉成就。
    梅莱契·巴巴尼在报告中介绍了阿尔巴尼亚人民军光荣的战斗历史。他说，我军所以能够战胜强大的敌人，是因为我军来自于人民，与人民紧密联系，是为祖国的利益而战斗，是因为它用崇高的马克思列宁主义武装起来的，是在光荣的劳动党和著名的统帅恩维尔·霍查同志领导下的，它所以能够取胜，是因为它是一支政治军队。他说，最近，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在军事方面作出了一系列重要决定，决定取消军衔，建立政治委员和党委制。这些革命的和具有远见的决定，在部队中激起了前所未有的革命热情。
    巴巴尼在报告中强烈谴责美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的罪行。他说，美国强盗最近对河内和海防的轰炸，说明了美帝国主义对整个越南公开进行武装侵略的性质。赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团直接和间接地支持美帝国主义侵略越南，他们的背叛等于向兄弟的越南人民发出一支冷箭。我们要尽一切可能支持越南人民反美正义斗争。他指出，对越南人民的英勇斗争采取什么态度，这是革命还是反革命的试金石。今天，第三条道路是没有的。或者是拥护革命，公开援助越南人民，或者是拥护反革命，支持美帝侵略越南。
    巴巴尼在热烈赞扬中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在各方面取得的伟大成就以后说，在马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林之后，出现了一位杰出的领袖，伟大的马克思列宁主义者，真正的理论导师毛泽东同志，这对世界各国马克思列宁主义者来说是莫大的幸运。
    巴巴尼在报告中还热烈赞扬中国人民解放军突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作所取得的巨大成果。他还高度评价阿中两国人民和两国军队之间的友谊和团结。
    梅莱契·巴巴尼临时代办报告后，袁子钦致感谢词。感谢他介绍了兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民军的光荣斗争历史和建军的宝贵经验。
    袁子钦强烈谴责美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防的罪行，愤怒指责苏联现代修正主义领导集团，无耻地勾结美国，对越南问题继续玩弄假支持、真出卖的阴谋，并且借机大肆反华。他说，七月三日我国政府发表了严正的声明，最强烈地谴责了美帝国主义的野蛮罪行。这个声明完全表达了全中国人民的意志，我们中国人民解放军坚决拥护，并且已经作好了充分准备。美帝国主义扩大侵越战争没有界限，我们援越抗美也没有界限。如果美帝国主义胆敢把战火扩大到中国人民头上，那么，不管它怎么来，来多少，我们都将坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它消灭掉。
    巴巴尼临时代办的报告和袁子钦的讲话，都博得全场一阵阵热烈的掌声。
    出席今天报告会的，还有各方面负责人潘振武、河流、毛鸿祥、王平水、尚思光、林彬、张国传、张正光等。
    阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使馆商务一等秘书卡锡姆·沙泼洛也出席了报告会。
