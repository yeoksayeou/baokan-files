	The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) "Vanguard" calls for repeated study of "On Practice" and "On Contradiction"
	Study of Mao Zedong's works to solve problems in the struggle

	BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) organ, "Vanguard," published an article in late June calling on communists to study Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" to guide the solution of practical problems in the struggle.

	The article, titled "Improving Our Study of Marxism-Leninism," says, "The people's struggle is constantly intensifying. We first learn in the struggle. If we understand the lessons of the struggle, then we have made a great step forward in Marxism-Leninism.

	"We must study Marxism-Leninism with a purpose, that is, it should be closely linked with the struggle of those engaged in this study to solve problems in the struggle.

	"The most effective way to understand this is to study the works of Mao Zedong. Each communist should study his 'On Practice' and 'On Contradiction' in connection with life and practice, which will mean a great development of communism."

	The "Vanguard" calls for the study of "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" as the basic study in Australia to guide the solution of specific problems.

	The article says, "Because we have studied the Marxist-Leninist thought methods and science summarized by Mao Zedong, we can solve the problems that constantly arise in life. In other words, in the struggle of the working class, we can see clearly ahead, understand progress and retreat, retreat and progress, success and failure, failure and success, and how to handle these problems.

	"Therefore, to temper the Marxist-Leninist work style and method, it is necessary to study and repeatedly study Mao Zedong's 'On Practice' and 'On Contradiction.'

	"Mao Zedong Thought is not complicated. This thought is life itself -- life that is explained and summarized, the movement and direction of life, and how to handle these problems."

	The article says, "Let us all use this method to read and study these two works. This is basic for the work style and method of a true communist.

	"'On Practice' and 'On Contradiction' show that independent thinking is very necessary for each person. Think in the practice of struggle, think again, think repeatedly."

	The article also calls for studying Comrade Lin Biao's "Long Live the Victory of People's War," the Chinese Communist Party's "Suggestions on the General Line of the International Communist Movement," and Chairman Hill's "Review and Prospect" under the guidance of "On Practice" and "On Contradiction."

    澳共（马列主义者）《先锋报》号召反复学习《实践论》《矛盾论》
    学习毛泽东著作解决斗争中的问题
    新华社三日讯  墨尔本消息：六月下旬出版的澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》发表文章，号召共产党人学习毛泽东同志的《实践论》和《矛盾论》来指导解决斗争中的实际问题。
    这篇题为《改进我们的马克思列宁主义的学习》的文章说，“人民的斗争在不断加强。我们首先是在斗争中学习。如果我们懂得了斗争的教训，那么在马克思列宁主义方面就前进了一大步。
    “我们学习马克思列宁主义必须有个目的，这就是说，应当同从事这种学习的人为解决斗争问题而进行的斗争密切联系起来。
    “了解这一点的最有效的方法，就是学习毛泽东的著作。每个共产党人联系生活和实践学习他的《实践论》和《矛盾论》，将意味着共产主义的巨大发展。”
    《先锋报》号召在澳大利亚把《实践论》和《矛盾论》的学习当做基本的学习，来指导解决具体问题。
    文章说，“因为我们钻研了毛泽东所概括的马克思列宁主义的思想方法和科学，就能够解决生活中不断出现的问题。换句话说，在工人阶级的斗争中，我们就能够心明眼亮地向前看，能够理解前进和退却，退却和前进，成功和失败，失败和成功诸如此类的问题，以及如何处理这些问题。
    “因此，为了锻炼马克思列宁主义的工作方法和作风，需要学习和反复地学习毛泽东的《实践论》和《矛盾论》。
    “毛泽东思想并不复杂。这种思想就是生活本身——得到说明的生活，得到概括的生活的运动和方向，以及如何处理这些问题。”
    文章说，“让我们每个人都用这个办法来阅读和学习这两篇著作。对真正的共产党人的工作方法和作风来说，这是基本的。
    “《实践论》和《矛盾论》说明每个人的独立思考是非常需要的。在斗争的实践中思考，再思考，反复地思考。”
    文章还号召在《实践论》和《矛盾论》的指导下学习林彪同志的《人民战争胜利万岁》、中国共产党《关于国际共产主义运动总路线的建议》以及澳共（马列主义者）主席希尔同志的《回顾与展望》。
