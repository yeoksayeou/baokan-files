The broad masses of peasants in Guizhou Province, one of the major tobacco-producing areas in our country, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, fought against nature, and achieved a great victory in the anti-drought transplanting of tobacco seedlings. By June 20, most of the tobacco seedlings had been transplanted. The area with the fastest progress, the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, has even overfulfilled its planting task. This year, fertilizer has been applied sufficiently, and the soil has been tilled finely, creating favorable conditions for high-quality and high-yield tobacco leaves.

    贵州战胜干旱栽下烟苗
    我国主要产烟区之一的贵州省的广大农民，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，发扬愚公移山的革命精神，与天斗，与地斗，取得了抗旱移栽烟苗的巨大胜利。到六月二十日，大部分烟苗已经移栽完毕。进度最快的黔东南苗族侗族自治州还超额完成了栽种任务。今年肥料施得足，土整得细，更为烟叶优质高产创造了条件。
