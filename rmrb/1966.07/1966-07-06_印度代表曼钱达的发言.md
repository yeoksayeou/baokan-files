Indian representative Abushimanyo Manchanda today addressed the plenary session of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. He said on behalf of the Indian delegation, in the name of anti-imperialist, patriotic, and militant Indian writers, that they extend their greetings to the conference. He said, "Imperialists and reactionaries see one representative after another passionately shouting 'Long live Chairman Mao!' They must be terrified."

He said, "The oppressed peoples of the world love China and Chairman Mao, while all reactionaries hate China and her great leader."

He said, "The Indian reactionaries, along with imperialists and Soviet revisionists, all hate revolutionary China and the Indian people. They are closely colluding to try every means to separate these two ancient nations."

Manchanda emphasized, "Our common enemies in the two countries want the 450 million Indian people and the 650 million Chinese people to fight each other. He firmly declared: No, the Indian people and the Chinese people will never fight each other!"

He said, "The Indian people and the Chinese people will definitely defeat the imperialist forces and their agents, the revisionists, in their plots and tricks."

He expressed gratitude for the great patience of the Chinese government in the border issue between China and India, and with a grateful heart accepted the concern shown by the Chinese government towards the Indian people, despite the repeated provocations by the reactionaries.

In his speech, Manchanda also severely condemned the Soviet revisionists and their Indian lackeys, the Danji faction, who, with the support of the Indian reactionaries, plotted and carried out dirty conspiracies and sabotage activities against the Asian and African Writers' Movement. He pointed out that their goal was to serve their imperialist masters.

Manchanda also discussed the Kashmir issue and the so-called "Tashkent Spirit." He said, "Only by resolving the issue democratically according to the wishes of the Kashmiri people can it help improve Indo-Pakistani relations and thwart imperialist interference in the internal affairs of these two countries." He pointed out that the notorious Tashkent Conference, organized by Soviet revisionists and supported by American imperialism, was a peace fraud aimed at uniting Pakistan and India to jointly oppose China. He said, "The Soviet revisionists, in order to serve Johnson's 'peaceful resolution' fraud, tried to sell this 'Tashkent Spirit' to the Vietnamese people."

He angrily condemned the recent U.S. imperialist bombing of the capital Hanoi and Haiphong in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and hailed the victory of the Vietnamese armed forces and the people of Hanoi in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

Manchanda said, "The Soviet revisionists are trying to join forces with U.S. imperialism to dominate the world. They are vigorously peddling Johnson's 'peace talks' fraud and spreading lies about 'building unity in the socialist camp and coordinating global forces to oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression in South Vietnam.' In reality, they are sparing no effort to split revolutionary forces and stabbing the Vietnamese people in the back."

In his speech, Manchanda highly praised Mao Zedong Thought. He praised Chairman Mao as the "genius of world revolution" and the "beloved leader of the world proletariat." He said, "We anti-imperialist Asian and African writers are indeed fortunate to live in the era of Mao Zedong. Let us march forward together, armed with the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought!"

He expressed on behalf of the Indian delegation their gratitude to the Standing Committee for the invitation to participate in this Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. He said the number of representatives from countries and international organizations attending this conference is unprecedented, and its brilliant achievements are a fitting response to the vicious enemies of the Asian and African peoples. He expressed support for the proposal to hold the Third Conference of Asian and African Writers in Beijing.

    印度代表曼钱达的发言
    新华社五日讯　印度代表阿布希曼约·曼钱达今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上发言时，代表印度代表团以反帝的、爱国的、战斗的印度作家的名义向大会致敬。他说，帝国主义和反动派看到这次会上一个代表接着一个代表热情高呼“毛泽东万岁！”他们一定会感到恐慌。他说，全世界被压迫人民爱中国，爱毛主席，而所有的反动派则仇视中国、仇视她的伟大领袖。
    他说，印度反动派同帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者都仇视革命的中国和印度人民，他们紧密地勾结在一起，想尽办法要把我们这两个古国分隔开来。
    曼钱达强调说，我们两国人民的这些死敌，想让四亿五千万印度人同六亿五千万中国人火并。他坚定地表示说：不，我们印度人民和中国人民决不火并！
    他说，我们印度人民和中国人民一定要击败帝国主义势力及其代理人修正主义者的阴谋诡计。
    他表示感激中国政府在中印边界问题上的巨大耐心，并以感激的心情领受中国政府对于印度人民所表现的关注，尽管反动派一再进行挑衅。
    曼钱达在讲话中还严厉谴责了苏联修正主义者和他们在印度的走狗丹吉分子在印度反动派的支持下，针对亚非作家运动策划的肮脏阴谋和破坏活动，指出他们的目的正是为他们的帝国主义主子效劳的。
    曼钱达在发言中还谈到了克什米尔问题和所谓“塔什干精神”。他说，只有按照克什米尔人民的愿望民主地解决问题，才能有助于改善印巴关系，并挫败帝国主义对这两个国家内部事务的干涉。他指出，由苏联修正主义者所组织并得到美帝国主义所赞助的臭名远扬的塔什干会议，是一个和平骗局，其目的是要让巴基斯坦和印度联合起来共同反华。他说，苏联修正主义者为了给约翰逊的“和平解决”骗局效劳，曾力图向越南人民推销这种“塔什干精神”。
    他愤怒地谴责美帝国主义最近轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内和海防的滔天罪行，欢呼越南武装力量和河内人民抗美救国斗争的胜利。
    曼钱达说，苏联修正主义者企图与美帝国主义结成一伙，主宰世界，他们竭力兜售约翰逊的“和平谈判”的骗局，散布“建立社会主义阵营的团结，和协调世界力量来反对美帝国主义对南越的侵略”的谎言。他们实际上是在不遗余力地分裂革命力量，并且在越南人民背上刺上一刀。
    曼钱达在发言中高度赞扬了毛泽东思想。他称赞毛泽东主席是“世界革命的天才”、“世界无产阶级敬爱的领袖”。他说，我们反帝的亚非作家能生活在毛泽东时代的确是幸运。让我们在毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的武器武装下，共同前进！
    他代表印度代表团感谢常设局的邀请能参加这次亚非作家紧急会议。他说参加这次会议的国家和国际组织代表的人数之多是空前的，它的光辉的成就是对亚非人民凶恶敌人的一个适宜的反击。他表示支持第三届亚非作家会议在北京举行的建议。
