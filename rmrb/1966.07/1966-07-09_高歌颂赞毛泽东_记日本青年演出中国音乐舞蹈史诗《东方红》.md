In praise of Mao Zedong
— Japanese Youth Perform the Chinese Musical and Dance Epic "The East Is Red"
A song of deep affection from the Japanese people

The East is red, the sun is rising,
China has given birth to Mao Zedong.
He seeks happiness for the people,
He is the great savior of the people.

Today, this is not only a song from the hearts of the Chinese people praising their beloved great leader, but it has also become a song of praise from the revolutionary people of Japan and from people all over the world for the great helmsman of the world revolution, Chairman Mao Zedong.

On June 25, in a large hall in Tokyo, more than 200 Japanese youth, filled with boundless love for Chairman Mao Zedong and deep affection for the 700 million people of China, performed for over a thousand Tokyo audience members the musical and dance epic "The East Is Red," which had been adapted by Japanese youth to reflect the glorious victories of Mao Zedong Thought in China.

On the blue curtain, a red sun rose. With the music of "The East is red, the sun is rising," the hall became quiet. But the silence was brief, as many audience members could not contain their excitement and began singing along with the music, clapping in rhythm. The singing and applause from the stage and the audience formed a powerful, majestic song of praise, filled with the deep affection of the Japanese people.

Following this, a pair of young men and women walked to the front of the stage and, in clear Chinese, emotionally recited:

On the vast expanse of the sea,
The sun rises in the east,
With rays of light shining brightly,
Singing joyfully,
Singing of the great leader Mao Zedong,
Singing of the glorious Communist Party of China.

During the performance, the youth learn Mao Zedong Thought

These youth are students and teachers of the "Kurashi Chinese Language Study Group" organized by the famous Chinese language scholar Kurashi Musashi. Everyone believes that through the performance of the musical and dance epic "The East Is Red," one can understand the great course of the Chinese revolution under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, and also consider with the audience "what is Japan like today, and what should we do in the future? What specific actions should we take?"

A young teacher who actively advocated for and participated in this performance said, "To understand today's New China, one must understand the history of countless revolutionary heroes who fought bravely to establish New China. To understand the thoughts, feelings, and aspirations of the Chinese people today, the best way is to study Mao Zedong Thought."

The director of this performance is not only a lover of Chinese music and dance but also an active learner of Chairman Mao's works. This young woman's name is Fujinami. When she first heard the musical and dance epic "The East Is Red" on a record, she was captivated. She continuously studied Chairman Mao's works, including Mao Zedong's writings during the Third Civil War, such as "The Present Situation and Our Tasks." She said, "Through participating in this performance of 'The East Is Red,' the image of Chairman Mao in my heart has become even greater." She said she likes the following lyrics from the "The East Is Red" epic that praise Chairman Mao:

"Looking up, I see the guiding light,
In my heart, I think of Mao Zedong,
When lost, I think of you for direction,
In the dark night, you light my path,
In times of difficulty, I think of you for strength,
In times of victory, I think of you for clarity."

Many of the young people who participated in the performance of "The East Is Red" shared their experiences, saying that performing "The East Is Red" was a lively and meaningful learning experience. A young woman said, "During rehearsals, every time I heard my classmates recite 'Everyone with tears of joy, everyone in high spirits... they are listening, listening, listening to Chairman Mao's voice that shakes the world: The People's Republic of China is born!' I was so moved that I wanted to cry. I think the significance of performing 'The East Is Red' is not just that it is a song and dance of New China, but also that through the performance, everyone can feel the joy of the Chinese people celebrating the birth of New China and understand the road of struggle that the Chinese revolution has traveled to achieve victory."

A young person who visited China last year played a Red Army soldier in the "Long March" segment of "The East Is Red." He said, "During the Long March, the Red Army soldiers fought and marched, crossing snow-capped mountains and grasslands, facing such hardships, yet each one was full of confidence. This is because Chairman Mao was with them, and they knew that following Chairman Mao meant victory."

This is a collective effort

The students of the "Kurashi Chinese Language Study Group" include factory workers, company employees, elementary and middle school teachers, and a considerable number of university students. They all come to the study group to learn Chinese at night. Rehearsals for "The East Is Red" could only be conducted after classes ended at 8 p.m. During the nearly two months of rehearsals, many people often stayed up late, working tirelessly. They did not even rest on Sundays.

Their performance also received help from many art troupes and musicians. A young performer from the "Matsuyama Ballet Troupe," who had just returned from studying in China, enthusiastically taught them Chinese dance and took on all the makeup work. An experienced amateur music conductor enthusiastically accepted the task of conducting the orchestra and chorus for "The East Is Red." This was his first time conducting the performance of Chinese songs. He told a Chinese reporter, "Although I don't understand Chinese, from the powerful melodies of Chinese revolutionary songs, I feel the spirit of struggle of the times they represent."

They spread Sino-Japanese friendship

When all the performers lined up in front of a backdrop of Tiananmen Gate in Beijing with a portrait of Chairman Mao, sang the last song "Workers of the World, Unite," and announced the end of the performance, the audience applauded for a long time, congratulating them on their successful performance. To thank the audience for their encouragement, the chorus sang "Let's Unite, Japanese and Chinese Youth" and "Tokyo-Beijing." The entire audience stood up and joined in the singing. At this moment, many audience members and some performers on stage could not help but shed tears.

A young woman studying Chinese said, "Seeing this scene, one can understand how much the Japanese people love Chairman Mao and yearn for New China. The friendship between the peoples of China and Japan is something that no one can destroy." She also said, "Being able to see 'The East Is Red' in Tokyo is a remarkable thing."

The young people who performed "The East Is Red" received many letters from the audience, which greatly encouraged them. One audience member wrote, "You have done a very meaningful thing." Another audience member wrote, "Your performance is a great encouragement to those who truly hope for friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, and a heavy blow to those who try to obstruct the development of friendship between the two peoples."

### 高歌颂赞毛泽东——记日本青年演出中国音乐舞蹈史诗《东方红》

    高歌颂赞毛泽东
    ——记日本青年演出中国音乐舞蹈史诗《东方红》
    倾注日本人民深情的赞歌
    东方红，太阳升，
    中国出了个毛泽东，
    他为人民谋幸福，
    他是人民大救星。
    今天，这不仅是发自中国人民内心深处对自己敬爱的伟大领袖的赞歌，而且成了革命的日本人民和全世界人民对伟大的世界革命的舵手——毛泽东主席的赞歌。
    六月二十五日，在东京的一个大厅里，二百多名日本青年，满怀着对毛泽东主席的无限热爱，满怀着对七亿中国人民的深情厚谊，向上千名的东京观众，表演了经过日本青年改编的反映伟大的毛泽东思想在中国取得辉煌胜利的音乐舞蹈史诗《东方红》。
    蔚蓝色的幕布上，一轮红日升起。在“东方红、太阳升”的乐声中，场内安静下来。但静寂只是短暂的，很多观众按捺不住激动的心情，随着音乐唱了起来，并且有节奏地鼓起掌来。台上台下的歌声、掌声，构成了一支浑厚、雄壮的、倾注了日本人民的深情的伟大赞歌。
    接着，一对男女青年，走到台前，用清晰的中国话，感情充沛地朗诵道：
    碧波万顷的海面上，
    旭日东升，
    光芒万丈，……
    纵情歌唱，
    歌唱伟大的领袖毛泽东，
    歌唱光荣的中国共产党。
    在演出的过程中学习毛泽东思想
    这些青年是日本著名的中国语言学者仓石武四郎主办的“仓石中国语讲习会”的学生和教员。大家认为，通过音乐舞蹈史诗《东方红》的演出，既可以了解在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下的中国革命的伟大历程，又可以同观众一起“考虑一下日本的今天，考虑一下今后应当怎么办？我们应当具体地做些什么？”
    一位积极倡议并参加了这次演出的青年教师说：“要了解今天的新中国，就应当了解无数革命英雄前赴后继为建立新中国而英勇斗争的历史。要了解中国人民今天的思想、感情、愿望，最好的途径就是学习毛泽东思想。”
    担任这次演出的导演，不仅是一个中国音乐舞蹈的爱好者，而且是学习毛主席著作的积极分子。这位女青年的名字叫藤波。当她第一次从唱片中听到音乐舞蹈史诗《东方红》时，就被吸引住了。她不断地学习毛主席的著作，学习了毛主席在第三次国内革命战争时期的著作《目前形势和我们的任务》。她说：“通过参加这次《东方红》的演出，毛主席的形象，在我的心目中，变得更加伟大了。”她说她最喜欢《东方红》史诗中歌颂毛主席的几句歌词：
    “抬头望见指路灯，
    心中想念毛泽东，
    迷路时想你有方向，
    黑夜里想你照路程，……
    困难时想你有力量，
    胜利时想你心里明。”
    许多参加《东方红》演出的青年人谈到自己的体会时都说，演出《东方红》是一次生动而有意义的学习。一位女青年说：“在排练中，每次我听到同学们朗诵到‘人人挂着喜悦的眼泪，个个兴高采烈……他们在倾听、倾听、倾听着毛主席震撼世界的声音：中华人民共和国诞生了！’的时候，都感动得要落泪。我认为演出《东方红》的意义不仅仅在于它是新中国的歌舞，而且在于通过演出，大家能够体会到中国人民欢庆新中国诞生的时候的喜悦心情，了解中国革命取得胜利前所走过的斗争道路。”
    去年访问过中国的一位青年在《东方红》中扮演《长征》中的红军战士。他说：“在长征中，红军战士边战斗、边行军，过雪山草地，那样艰苦，可是个个充满信心。这就是因为毛主席和他们在一起，他们知道跟着毛主席走，就是胜利。”
    这是集体的劳动成果
    “仓石中国语讲习会”的学生，有工厂的工人、有公司的职员、有中小学教师，还有相当多的大学生，他们全是在夜间来讲习会学习中文的。每天排练《东方红》，只能在晚上八点钟上完课以后进行。在近两个月的排练期间，有许多人经常是紧张地忙到半夜。甚至星期天也不休息。
    他们的演出，也得到了许多文艺团体和音乐舞蹈家的帮助。刚从中国学习回国的“松山芭蕾舞团”青年演员田中俊行热心地教他们学习中国舞蹈，还主动担任全部化妆工作。一位很有经验的业余音乐指挥，积极热情地接受了担任《东方红》的乐队和合唱的指挥。这是他第一次指挥演唱中国歌曲。他对中国记者说：“虽然我听不懂中国话，可是从中国革命歌曲的有力的旋律中，我体会到了它所表现的时代的斗争精神。”
    他们传播了中日友谊
    当全体表演者列队在悬挂着毛主席象的北京天安门的背景前，唱完最后一支歌曲《全世界无产者联合起来》，宣布演出结束的时候，观众长时间鼓掌，祝贺他们演出成功。为了感谢观众的鼓励，合唱队又演唱了《中日青年团结起来》和《东京—北京》两支歌曲。全场观众起立加入了合唱。这时，许多观众和台上的一些演员都不禁流下了热泪。
    一个正在学习中文的青年妇女说：“看到这种情景，可以知道日本人民是怎样热爱毛主席，向往新中国。日中两国人民的友谊，是什么人也破坏不了的。”她还说：“在东京能够看到《东方红》是一件了不起的事。”
    演出《东方红》的青年们，收到许多观众的来信，受到很大的鼓励。一位观众写道：“你们做了一件很有意义的事。”还有一位观众写道：“你们的演出，对真心期望日中人民友谊的人是很大的鼓舞，对企图阻挠发展两国人民友谊的人是沉重的打击。”
