	The Liberation Army of South Vietnam annihilates a U.S. armored combat unit
	The Liberation Radio of South Vietnam calls on military and civilians to demand blood debt from the U.S. imperialists

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 1st: The Liberation Communication Agency of South Vietnam reported that the armed forces of the liberation of South Vietnam's Tuyen Duc province, in order to punish the savage crimes of the U.S. aggressors bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, bravely intercepted and annihilated a tank and armored vehicle combat unit of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division on the morning of June 30th on the 13th Highway. According to initial statistics, the liberation armed forces destroyed 40 U.S. tanks and M-113 type amphibious armored vehicles, and completely annihilated the U.S. invading soldiers on the vehicles.

	The report said that this battle took place near the Phu Long military outpost command post north of the Cam Ly Bridge. At the beginning, the liberation army powerfully intercepted the advance of the U.S. armored combat unit and tightly sealed off its rear, quickly surrounding and annihilating it. Under the brave attacks of the liberation armed forces, the communication and command of the U.S. armored combat unit immediately fell into paralysis, and the enemy's aircraft and artillery could not provide support. The liberation army quickly took full control of the battlefield and seized many spoils.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 1st: The Liberation Radio of South Vietnam issued a commentary on June 30th on the U.S. imperialists' brazen dispatch of aircraft to bomb the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong, pointing out that the military and civilians of South Vietnam are determined to demand blood debt from the U.S. aggressors.

	The commentary said that the U.S. imperialists' attack on Hanoi is another unforgivable crime committed against the Vietnamese people.

	The commentary said that the military and civilians of South Vietnam have deeply etched in their hearts the deep hatred for the U.S. aggressors over the years. Today, this hatred has deepened even more due to the U.S. imperialists' blatant provocations. It calls on and encourages the military and civilians of South Vietnam to demand this eternal blood debt from the U.S. aggressors.

	The commentary said that the Vietnamese people have never invaded an inch of U.S. territory, but the U.S. aggressors have arbitrarily interfered in Vietnam's internal affairs, brazenly using expeditionary forces and chemical poisons to kill the people of South Vietnam, bombing the North, and massacring the Vietnamese people. This hatred is deeper than the sea and higher than the mountains. The crimes committed by U.S. imperialism, the Vietnamese people will make them pay tenfold. U.S. imperialism cannot escape the severe punishment of the Vietnamese people. The U.S. aggressors in South Vietnam, whether in the sky or on the ground, whether hiding in fortifications and outposts or lurking in the nests of Saigon and Da Nang, will not be able to escape the heavy blows of the military and civilians of South Vietnam. The hatred and anger of the military and civilians of South Vietnam will burn them to death.

    以更沉重的打击严惩美帝轰炸河内海防的罪行
    南越解放军全歼美军一个装甲战团
    南越解放电台号召军民向美帝讨还血债
    据新华社河内一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方土龙木省解放武装力量为了惩罚美国强盗轰炸河内、海防的野蛮罪行，于六月三十日上午在第十三号公路上，英勇截击并歼灭美国第一步兵师的一个坦克和装甲车战团。据初步统计，解放武装力量共击毁美军坦克和M—113型两栖装甲车四十辆，全部歼灭车上的美国侵略军。
    报道说，这次战斗是在距离敌人的平龙军事小区指挥所北面的芹黎桥附近进行的。一开始，解放军就有力地截住这个美军装甲战团的先头部队，并紧紧封锁住它的尾部，迅速将它包围歼灭。在解放武装力量的英勇打击下，美军装甲战团的通讯联络同指挥部立即陷于瘫痪，敌人的飞机和大炮无法进行支援。解放军很快就完全控制了阵地，并且缴获了许多战利品。
    据新华社河内一日电　越南南方解放电台六月三十日就美帝国主义悍然派遣飞机轰炸河内市和海防市的新的战争“升级”行动发表评论指出，越南南方军民决心要向美国侵略强盗讨还血债。
    评论说，美帝国主义进攻河内，是对越南人民犯下的又一个不可饶恕的大罪行。
    评论说，越南南方军民多年来在心中深深地刻上了对美国强盗的深仇大恨。今天，这种仇恨由于美帝国主义明目张胆的挑衅行为而更加加深了。它召唤和鼓励着南方军民去向美国强盗讨还这笔永世不忘的血债。
    评论说，越南人民从没有侵犯过美国的一寸土地，但是美国强盗却无端干涉越南的内政，悍然使用远征军和化学毒药杀害南方人民，轰炸北方，残杀越南人民。这个仇恨比海还要深，比山还要高。美帝国主义犯下的罪行，越南人民将要他们以十倍的代价来偿还。美帝国主义无法逃脱越南人民对他们的严厉惩罚。美国强盗在越南南方，无论是在天空中，还是在地面上，龟缩在工事、据点里，还是躲藏在西贡和岘港的巢穴中，也别想逃脱南方军民沉重的打击。南方军民的仇恨怒火将把他们烧死。
