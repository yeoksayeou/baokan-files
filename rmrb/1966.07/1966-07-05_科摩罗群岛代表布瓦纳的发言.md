	Comoros Representative Abdou Bakari Bouana today said at the emergency meeting of the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference, "The struggle of the Vietnamese people is also the struggle of the Comoros people. The defeats suffered by the aggressors and their puppets in Vietnam provide a concrete example, showing imperialism and its allies—colonialism and neo-colonialism—that the era of one nation oppressing another has passed."

	He angrily condemned the U.S. government's aggressive crimes in Vietnam. He also exposed the brutal exploitation and rule that French imperialism had imposed on the people of the Comoros Islands for over a hundred years, as well as the anti-imperialist struggle of the Comoros people.

	He said, "As long as our Palestinian brothers are still driven from their homeland and deprived of all rights by imperialism led by the United States, we will never have peace."

	He condemned the cultural aggression of imperialism against Asian and African countries. He believed that progressive writers should take up their pens to guide the masses to the correct path and strike at the cultural poison spread by imperialism. He said, "If we do not carry out a cultural revolution, political and social revolutions will easily be crushed."

   科摩罗群岛代表布瓦纳的发言
    新华社四日讯　科摩罗群岛代表阿布杜·巴卡里·布瓦纳今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，越南人民的斗争，也是科摩罗人民的斗争。侵略者及其傀儡在越南遭受的失败提供了一个具体的例证，它向帝国主义及其同盟——殖民主义和新殖民主义者表明，一个民族压迫另一民族的时代已一去不复返了。
    他愤怒谴责美国政府对越南的侵略罪行。他还揭露了法帝国主义一百多年来对科摩罗群岛人民进行的残酷剥削和统治，以及科摩罗人民的反帝斗争。
    他说，只要我们的巴勒斯坦兄弟还被赶离自己的国土，被以美国为首的帝国主义剥夺了一切权利，我们就永远不会有和平。
    他谴责了帝国主义对亚非国家进行的文化侵略。他认为进步作家应该拿起笔杆来向群众指出正确的道路，打击帝国主义散布的文化毒素。他说，如果不进行文化革命，政治和社会革命就易于被击溃。
