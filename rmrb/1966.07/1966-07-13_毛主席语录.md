	Chairman Mao's Quotations
	Oppressed peoples and oppressed nations must not pin their hopes for liberation on the "wisdom" of imperialism and its running dogs, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle.

		*From the "Statement Opposing the Aggression and Massacre of the People of South Vietnam by the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem Clique"*
