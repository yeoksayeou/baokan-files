I volunteer to enlist in the army to undertake the glorious task of defending our motherland. As a citizen of the People's Republic of China, I have the sacred duty to defend my country. As long as imperialism exists, there will be war, for the nature of imperialism is warlike. We must be fully prepared to prevent the outbreak of war. Once imperialism launches a war, we will march to the battlefield with our chests puffed out, to annihilate the enemy, to eliminate war, to defend the happy life of the people, to safeguard the territory and borders of the motherland, to reclaim the motherland's territory of Taiwan, and to rescue our fellow countrymen in Taiwan from their misery.

I am an only child. What makes me happiest is that my two elderly parents support me in enlisting to take on the heavy responsibility of defending the motherland and the people. I have a burning heart and am determined to go to the front lines to defend the motherland.

I swear that I will definitely go to the front lines to defend the territory and borders of the motherland. This makes me think of growing up in such a land, in the era of Mao Zedong, and I am proud of it. Where did such a life come from? It is the blood of our predecessors that bought it. Therefore, I am determined to enlist and, with my actions, repay the hopes of our old comrades. Although human life is only one, it is not as precious as the motherland. As long as I dedicate myself to the motherland, to the people, and to the truth, even if I sacrifice my life and lose my youth, I will still feel proud and honored, and it will be glorious and happy. Please, the organization, believe in me and definitely approve my enlistment, to go to the most difficult places to temper myself into the strongest person, to become a glorious soldier of the people.

	Farewell, great year of 1963!

	1963 is a year of harvest, a year of victory:
	Socialism is marching towards victory, imperialism is heading towards death;
	Marxism-Leninism continues to advance, revisionism is in its most difficult stage.
	Today, it is still the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, and it will forever be the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind.
	Although it is so, the nature of imperialism will not change. As long as imperialism exists, there is the possibility of war. Therefore, at the time of bidding farewell to 1963 and welcoming 1964, I am determined to serve, to defend our beloved motherland, to stand at the forefront of the motherland, to firmly grasp the weapons in my hands, to strike the invaders at any time, and to defend world peace.

	I swear to the motherland and the people: beloved motherland, I will definitely defend you, and I am willing to dedicate my youth and life to you, to the most magnificent cause in the world!

	Mao Zedong Thought has shown me the way forward.

	I have read Chairman Mao's works, which have deeply educated and enlightened me. My eyes have been opened to see a bright path in front of me, making me understand who our enemies and friends are, the primary question of the revolution; and making me understand class struggle, proletarian revolution, proletarian dictatorship, communism...

	I have studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People" and have repeatedly pondered the meaning of these words. How should one spend one's life? One must create the most reasonable and beautiful society for the masses—the communism. At that time, classes will be eliminated, exploitation will be eliminated, everyone will work, and everyone will live a happy life.

	1964-05-xx

	Since the socialist education, my thoughts have undergone a great transformation. Every time I study Chairman Mao's works, I gain more enlightenment... It makes me vigilant that today's class struggle, both domestically and internationally, is extremely sharp and complex. Imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries are vying for the younger generation, using various bourgeois ideas to corrupt the youth, like sugar-coated bullets, hoping to place their hopes of counter-revolutionary restoration on the degeneration of the young generation. And individualistic thoughts are precisely the loopholes they want to exploit. If one does not pay attention to thorough reform and cleansing, then under certain conditions, one's thoughts will inevitably rot and decay, eventually becoming a captive of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, I deeply feel that studying Chairman Mao's works must thoroughly reform one's worldview.

	1964-07-22

	I reviewed the article "Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle" because last night the deputy squad leader left, handing over the tasks here to me.

	To study this article, one must understand three issues:
	1. The nature of imperialism and reactionaries will not change;
	2. The logic of imperialists and the logic of the people;
	3. Resolutely struggle against imperialism and all reactionaries to the end.

	I will definitely lead my comrades to heighten their vigilance and be ready to annihilate the enemy at any time! Recognize the true nature of the U.S. imperialists and strengthen our fighting will!

	1964-08-24

	"Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution." Revolutionaries must distinguish who our enemies and friends are. If one does not act according to Chairman Mao's words, one will treat enemies as friends and friends as enemies. I will forever remember this sentence.

    千万不要忘记阶级斗争
　　一九六二年六月十七日
    我志愿申请报名应征入伍，去担负起保卫祖国的光荣任务。因为我是中华人民共和国的一个公民，我有保卫祖国的神圣职责。帝国主义还存在，战争就会存在，因为帝国主义的本质是好战的。我们要做好充分的准备，防止战争的爆发。一旦帝国主义发动了战争，我们就挺起胸膛走向战场，去消灭敌人，消灭战争，来保卫人民的幸福生活，捍卫祖国的领土和边疆，夺回祖国的领土台湾，让它重新回到祖国的怀抱，把受苦受难的台湾同胞从水火中救出来。
    我是一个独生子，使我感到最高兴的是二位老人能支持我去应征入伍，去担负起保卫祖国、保卫人民的重大责任，我有颗火热的心，决心到保卫祖国的岗位上去。
    我宣誓，我一定要到保卫祖国的前线，去捍卫祖国的领土和边疆。这使我不能不联想到我生长在这样的国土里，生长在毛泽东时代而自豪。这样的生活从何处来？这是我们的前辈用鲜血换来的，所以我决心去应征入伍，用我的实际行动来报答老前辈对我的希望。虽然人的生命只有一条，但是生命的宝贵比不上祖国更宝贵。只要我一心一意为了祖国，为了人民，为了真理，那怕牺牲了自己的生命，失去了自己的青春，我也感到骄傲和自豪，也是光荣的，也是幸福的。请组织上相信我，一定批准我去，到最艰苦的地方去锻炼自己成为最坚强的人，成为光荣的人民战士。
          （注：这是刘英俊同志的入伍申请书）
              一九六三年十二月三十日
    伟大的六三年，再见吧！
    六三年是丰收年，是胜利年：
    社会主义走向胜利，帝国主义走向死亡；
    马克思主义继续走向发展前程，修正主义走上了最困难阶段。
    今天仍然是东风压倒西风，永远是东风压倒西风。
    虽然是这样，但帝国主义的本性是不会改变的，帝国主义存在一天，就有爆发战争的可能。所以在送六三年迎六四年之时，我决心服役，保卫可爱的祖国，站在祖国最前哨，紧握手中的武器，随时打击侵略者，保卫世界和平。
    向祖国及人民宣誓：可爱的祖国，我坚决保卫你，愿把我的青春和生命献给你，献给世界上最壮丽的事业！
                一九六四年五月×日
    毛泽东思想给我指明了前进的道路。
    我读了毛主席著作，有极深刻的教育与启发。我的眼睛亮了很多，我看到了摆在我面前的一条光明大道，使我了解了谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友这个革命的首要问题；又使我了解了阶级斗争，无产阶级革命，无产阶级专政，共产主义……。
    我学习了《纪念白求恩》和《为人民服务》等文章，反复琢磨着这些话的含意。一个人的一生应怎样的度过？必须要为人民大众创造一个最合理、最美好的社会——共产主义。到那时候，阶级消灭了，剥削消灭了，人人劳动，人人过着幸福生活。
                一九六四年五月×日
    自从社会主义教育以后，自己的思想有了很大的转折。每次学习毛主席著作都得到更大的提高。……使我警惕到，今天国内外的阶级斗争，是极为尖锐复杂的，帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派都在争夺青年一代，他们用形形色色的资产阶级思想来腐蚀青年，就象糖衣炮弹一样，企图把反革命复辟的希望寄托在年青一代的变质上。而个人主义思想正是他们所要利用的一个缺口，如果不注意彻底的改造和清洗，那么在一定的条件下，自己的思想必然会发臭、发霉，以至堕落成为资产阶级的俘虏。因此，我深深的体会到，学习毛主席著作，必须彻底地改造自己的世界观。
            一九六四年七月二十二日
    我重学了《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》这篇文章，因为昨天晚上副班长走了，把这里的任务交给了我。
    学习这篇文章，必须领会三个问题：
    1、帝国主义和反动派的本性不会改变；
    2、帝国主义者的逻辑和人民的逻辑；
    3、坚决同帝国主义和一切反动派斗争到底。
    我一定带领同志们提高警惕，一定要随时准备消灭敌人！认清美帝本质，增强战斗意志！
              一九六四年八月二十四日
      “谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”革命者必须分清谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友。不按着毛主席这段话来作，就会把敌人当朋友，把朋友当敌人，我一定永记这句话。
