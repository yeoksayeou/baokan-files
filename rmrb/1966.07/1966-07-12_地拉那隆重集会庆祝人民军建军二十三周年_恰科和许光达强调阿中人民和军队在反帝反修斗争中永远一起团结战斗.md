Tirana, July 10 - A grand rally of 5,000 people was held in the "Partisan" Stadium in the Albanian capital of Tirana on the evening of the 9th to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army.

The celebration was organized by the Albanian Ministry of National Defense. Attending the rally were: Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Beqir Balluku, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party, First Secretary of the Tirana City Committee Kadri Hazbiu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party, Chief of the General Staff of the People's Army Petrit Dumo, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the People's Council of Tirana Kajo Kelmendi, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Nesti Nasi, among others.

The Chinese military delegation, led by Vice Minister of National Defense Xu Guangda, was also invited to attend the rally.

Hito Cako, Chief of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army, delivered a speech at the rally.

Cako, in his speech, reviewed the glorious history of the Albanian People's Army under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Labor Party. He particularly mentioned that since the publication of the Central Committee's open letter, all the soldiers and officers of the People's Army have, with high revolutionary spirit and party loyalty, completed the tasks assigned by the Party. They have made great achievements in strengthening political and ideological work, enhancing military preparedness and improving military technology, as well as in production.

Cako emphasized that the Albanian People's Army has grown into a powerful revolutionary army. He said that the 23-year history of the Albanian People's Army clearly shows: as long as our army continues to hold high the Party's banner of victory, adheres to and remains loyal to the thoughts of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, strengthens the education of revolutionary traditions of the people and maintains close ties with the people; then, it will never bring harm to the motherland, never betray class interests, and never abandon the sacred duty of supporting the international proletariat.

Cako said that today, all the soldiers and officers of the Albanian People's Army can report to the Party Central Committee and the government that the historic reforms in the army have been successfully completed on schedule. The Party's revolutionary measures have aroused great enthusiasm in the army, mobilizing the entire army to raise political and ideological work, military technology, and all daily work to a higher level. Our army's preparedness has never been as good as it is today, to complete any task assigned by the Party and to defend the borders of the socialist motherland and the fruits of the people's revolution.

Cako expressed that the Albanian People's Army is determined to fight alongside the Albanian people against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet leadership. He concluded by enthusiastically praising the great fighting friendship between the peoples and armies of Albania and China in their common struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism.

Following this, Xu Guangda, the leader of the Chinese military delegation, spoke at the rally.

Xu Guangda, in his speech, highly praised the Albanian People's Army. He said that the Albanian People's Army is a heroic people's army with a glorious fighting history and has been tested in many battles. For many years, American imperialism and its faithful henchman, the Tito clique, have tried every means to strangle revolutionary Albania. The Soviet modern revisionists have exerted tremendous pressure from political, economic, and other aspects, trying to crush Albania. However, the Albanian people and their army, under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Labor Party, with the revolutionary heroism of "preferring to die standing to living on their knees," have overcome countless difficulties, defeated all the conspiracies of domestic and foreign enemies, and achieved great successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Xu Guangda enthusiastically praised the thriving revolutionary new situation in the Albanian People's Army during the nationwide mass revolutionary movement. He pointed out that the heroic Albanian People's Army, adhering to the proletarian line of building the army, will undoubtedly make extremely important contributions to continuously improving its political quality and combat effectiveness, defending the socialist motherland, and safeguarding European and world peace.

Xu Guangda then spoke about the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and Comrade Lin Biao, has achieved great successes in all aspects of work by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Xu Guangda said that emphasizing politics is the core of Comrade Mao Zedong's military thought and line, and is the glorious tradition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

He said that emphasizing politics in our army is to emphasize Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and to regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive for all work in our entire army.

He said that Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most active Marxism-Leninism, and a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism and modern revisionism. Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our Party and our lifeline. For the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the best weapon is not the airplane, not the cannon, not the tank, not the atomic bomb, but Mao Zedong Thought. The greatest combat effectiveness is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. All officers and soldiers in our Chinese People's Liberation Army hold deep respect for Comrade Mao Zedong and strong proletarian feelings for Mao Zedong Thought. Every officer and soldier regards studying Chairman Mao's works as a compulsory course. "Everyone reads Chairman Mao's books, listens to Chairman Mao's words, acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and becomes a good soldier of Chairman Mao," has become the conscious action of the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Xu Guangda, when talking about the current international situation, said that in recent days, American imperialism has brought the war to the capital of the Vietnamese people, which is another escalation of American imperialism's war of aggression and the development of the war of aggression to a new and more serious stage. In this regard, our government reiterates that the 700 million Chinese people, no matter what sacrifices and prices they have to pay, will be ready at any time to take all necessary actions according to the interests and requirements of the Vietnamese people to support the fraternal Vietnamese people. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have already made preparations. The Chinese people, under any circumstances, will, together with the Albanian people and all the people of the world, wholeheartedly support the Vietnamese people to fight to the end until they drive out all American imperialists from Vietnam and achieve final victory.

He said that opposing or not opposing American imperialism is the dividing line between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism. The Soviet leadership clique talks about "aiding Vietnam and opposing America," but in reality, they are helping the American imperialists to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people. They have already degenerated into traitors of Marxism-Leninism and accomplices of American imperialism. While opposing American imperialism, we must also oppose Khrushchev revisionism.

Xu Guangda concluded by saying that we are deeply convinced that no matter what changes occur in the world, and no matter what storms and waves appear on the road ahead, the peoples and armies of China and Albania will forever stand together and fight together.

The speeches by Cako and Xu Guangda were repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause and cheers. The crowd shouted slogans such as "Enver—Labor Party!", "Long live the Albanian Labor Party!", "Long live the People's Army!", "Long live Mao Zedong!", "Long live the Communist Party of China!", "Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!", and "Victory to the Vietnamese people!" and so on.

At the rally, the Chinese military delegation presented a banner to the Albanian People's Army. The banner read: "The great fighting friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Albania will last forever!" After presenting the banner, Xu Guangda and Dumo warmly shook hands and embraced.

Also invited to attend the rally were Wang Jinchuan, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, and Military Attaché Li Yifan. After the rally, Albanian artists performed songs and dances.

Tirana, July 11 - The Albanian Ministry of National Defense held a banquet in Tirana on the evening of the 10th to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army.

Attending the banquet were Minister of National Defense Beqir Balluku, Minister of Internal Affairs Haxhi Lleshi, Chief of the General Staff of the People's Army Petrit Dumo, Minister of Foreign Affairs Nesti Nasi, Chief of the Political Department of the People's Army Hito Cako, as well as other military officers and guests.

The Chinese military delegation led by Vice Minister of National Defense Xu Guangda, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania Wang Jinchuan, and Military Attaché Li Yifan were also invited to attend the banquet.

At the banquet, Chief of the General Staff of the Albanian People's Army Petrit Dumo and Leader of the Chinese military delegation Xu Guangda made toasts.

　　地拉那隆重集会庆祝人民军建军二十三周年
　　恰科和许光达强调阿中人民和军队在反帝反修斗争中永远一起团结战斗
    新华社地拉那十日电阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那五千人九日晚上在“游击队”体育馆隆重集会，庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军二十三周年。
    庆祝大会是由阿尔巴尼亚国防部组织的。出席大会的有：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长巴卢库，党中央政治局委员、地拉那市委员会第一书记穆夫蒂乌，党中央政治局候补委员、人民军总参谋长杜米，地拉那市人民会议执行委员会主席凯莱齐和外交部长纳赛等人。
    正在阿尔巴尼亚访问的、由国防部副部长许光达率领的中国军事代表团应邀参加了大会。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任希托·恰科在会上作了报告。
    恰科在报告中追述了阿尔巴尼亚人民军在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下所走过的光荣道路。他特别谈到了自从劳动党中央公开信发表以来，全体人民军指战员为了完成党对他们提出的任务，以高度的革命精神和党性进行巨大的工作，在加强政治思想工作、加强战备和提高军事技术方面以及部队在大搞生产方面所取得的巨大成就。
    恰科强调指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民军已经成长为一支强大的革命军队。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民军二十三年的生活清楚地证明：我们的军队，只要它不断高举党的胜利的旗帜，掌握并永远忠于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的思想，加强人民革命传统的教育和同人民的血肉联系；那末，就永远不会使祖国遭受损害，永远不会违背阶级的利益，永远不会放弃支持国际无产阶级的神圣职责。
    恰科说，今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民军全体指战员可以向党中央和政府报告，在军队中进行的历史性的改革已经如期胜利完成。党的革命化措施在军队中引起了巨大的热情，使全军动员起来，把政治思想工作、军事技术和一切日常工作提到一个更高的水平。我军的准备从来没有作得象今天这样好，以完成党指定的任何任务，保卫社会主义祖国的边疆和人民革命的胜利果实。
    恰科表示，阿尔巴尼亚人民军决心与阿尔巴尼亚人民一道，同以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义斗争到底。他最后热情地赞扬了阿中两国人民及其军队在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的共同斗争中结成的伟大的战斗友谊。
    接着，中国军事代表团团长许光达在大会上讲话。
    许光达在讲话中高度赞扬了阿尔巴尼亚人民军。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民军是一支有着光辉战斗历程、久经战斗考验的、英雄的人民军队。多少年来，美帝国主义及其忠实走狗铁托集团，千方百计地想要扼杀革命的阿尔巴尼亚。苏联现代修正主义者从政治、经济等各个方面施加巨大的压力，想把阿尔巴尼亚压倒、压垮。但是，阿尔巴尼亚人民及其军队，在以恩·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，以“宁愿站着死，不愿跪着生”的革命英雄气概，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，克服了重重困难，战胜了国内外敌人的一切阴谋，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，取得了巨大的成就。
    许光达热烈赞扬在阿尔巴尼亚全国掀起的轰轰烈烈的群众性革命化运动中，阿尔巴尼亚人民军出现的蓬蓬勃勃的一派革命新气象。他指出，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军坚持无产阶级建军路线，对于不断提高自己的政治素质和战斗威力，保卫社会主义祖国、保卫欧洲和世界和平，必将作出极其重大的贡献。
    许光达接着谈到中国人民解放军，在中国共产党中央委员会、中央军委和林彪同志的领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在各项工作中所取得的伟大成就。
    许光达说，突出政治，是毛泽东同志建军思想和建军路线的核心，是中国人民解放军的光荣传统。
    他说，我军突出政治就是突出毛泽东思想，就是要活学活用毛主席著作，就是要把毛主席的书当作我们全军各项工作的最高指示。
    他说，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的强大思想武器，毛泽东思想是我们党的灵魂，是我们的命根子。对中国人民解放军来说，最好的武器不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，而是毛泽东思想。最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。我们中国人民解放军全军上下，对毛泽东同志怀着无比敬爱，对毛泽东思想怀着强烈的无产阶级感情。每一个干部、战士，都把学习毛主席著作当作必修课。“人人读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”，已成为中国人民解放军广大指战员的自觉行动。
    许光达在谈到目前的国际形势时说，这几天来，美帝国主义把战火烧到越南人民的首都，这是美帝国主义侵略战争的又一次升级，是把侵略战争发展到新的更加严重的阶段。对此，我国政府重申，七亿中国人民，不论付出多大牺牲代价，将随时准备根据越南人民的利益和要求采取一切必要的行动，支援兄弟的越南人民。中国人民和中国人民解放军已经作好了准备。中国人民不论在什么情况下，都将同阿尔巴尼亚人民和全世界人民一道，全力支援越南人民坚决打到底，直到把美帝国主义全部赶出越南取得最后胜利。
    他说，反对不反对美帝国主义，是马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义的分界线。苏共领导集团口头上讲的是“援越反美”，实际上是帮助美帝扑灭越南人民的革命烈火。他们已经堕落成为马列主义的叛徒，成为美帝的帮凶。在反对美帝的同时，必须反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义。
    许光达最后说，我们深信，不论世界上发生什么变化，不管在前进的道路上出现什么惊涛骇浪，我们中阿两国人民和军队都将永远团结在一起，战斗在一起。
    恰科和许光达的讲话不时被热烈的掌声和欢呼声所打断。人们高呼“恩维尔—劳动党！”“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！”“人民军万岁！”“毛泽东万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“中国人民解放军万岁！”“越南人民必胜！”等口号。
    在大会上，中国军事代表团向阿尔巴尼亚人民军赠送了锦旗。锦旗上写着：“中阿两国人民和军队之间的伟大战斗友谊万古长青！”赠旗后，许光达同杜米热烈握手拥抱。
    应邀出席大会的还有中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办王锦川和武官李一凡。会后，阿尔巴尼亚艺术家演出了歌舞节目。
    新华社地拉那十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚国防部十日晚在地拉那举行宴会，庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军二十三周年。
    出席宴会的有国防部长巴卢库，内务部长哈兹比乌，人民军总参谋长杜米，外交部长纳赛，人民军政治部主任恰科，以及人民军军官和其他人士。
    由国防部副部长许光达率领的中国军事代表团、中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办王锦川、武官李一凡也应邀出席了宴会。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军总参谋长杜米和中国军事代表团团长许光达在宴会上祝了酒。
