	In the full session of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, Indonesian representative Aganam Wisbi said today that the history of the liberation struggle of the peoples of the world, especially those of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, has proven that the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought has great international significance. It has enormous power to change the world, society, and people's worldviews. In other words, only when revolutionaries raise the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, which has reached the pinnacle of revolutionary theory, and the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, which is decisive for building a socialist society and for the liberation struggle of all mankind, can the revolution achieve victory.

	Wisbi said that in the struggle currently being waged by the Vietnamese people, the hearts of all the people of the world—including the honest people of the United States—are with the Vietnamese people. He angrily condemned the recent serious crime of the U.S. imperialists bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. He pointed out that this only exposes their desperation and ugly face, further revealing that the "peace talks" propagated by U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism are a big fraud.

	He said, we demand that the U.S. imperialist troops immediately withdraw from Vietnamese territory. We call on Asian and African writers to condemn the savage aggression of U.S. imperialism in clear, resolute, and strong language, and to support the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

	He said, progressive writers in Indonesia condemn the conspiracies of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys and accomplices, the pseudo-revolutionaries, and the modern revisionists. He pointed out that the revisionists are peddling the bankrupt "peace talks" of the Johnson government, with the aim of collaborating with U.S. imperialism to dominate the world and betray the Vietnamese people.

	Wisbi talked about the situation in Indonesia, angrily condemning the bloody crimes of the Nasution-Suharto military regime in suppressing the progressive forces of Indonesia. He said that history will never forgive them, and the people will rise up to resist. The progressive and revolutionary forces of Indonesia, after arduous struggles and sacrifices, will overcome all difficulties and ultimately defeat the fascist military regime and achieve victory in their struggle.

	He exposed the despicable behavior of Soviet revisionists in supporting Nasution-Suharto. He said that after the counter-revolutionary coup of Nasution-Suharto, the Soviet government continued to agree to provide weapons aid to this fascist regime. This aid is to help the reactionary regime of Indonesia slaughter Indonesian patriots.

	Wisbi also condemned the barbaric acts of the Nasution-Suharto fascist dictatorship against the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and the persecution of Chinese residents in Indonesia. He said that these criminal acts are unprecedented in international relations. He pointed out that the evil deeds of the right-wing forces in Indonesia are serving the global strategy of U.S. imperialism to "contain" China.

	He enthusiastically supported the recent statement of the Standing Committee of the Asian and African Writers' Conference, condemning the conspiracy of Soviet revisionists to hold a conference in Baku with the participation of Asian and African writers. He said that this is actually an illegal move to transfer the venue of the Third Conference from Indonesia to Baku in the Soviet Union.

	He said that due to the situation in Indonesia, the fascist military authorities are implementing white terror, making it impossible to hold the Third Asian and African Writers' Conference in Indonesia. Wisbi said that as Indonesian revolutionary writers, as the original hosts of the Third Asian and African Writers' Conference, they propose that the Third Writers' Conference be held in China.

	Wisbi enthusiastically praised the unprecedented great event of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China. He said that the helmsman of this great cultural revolution is Chairman Mao Zedong. This cultural revolution, in which tens of millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, and intellectuals are participating, will surely bring fresh air to the struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

    在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上
    印度尼西亚代表维斯比的发言
    新华社三日讯　印度尼西亚代表阿甘姆·维斯比今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，全世界，特别是亚非拉人民的解放斗争史，证明了光辉的毛泽东思想具有伟大的国际意义。它对改变世界、社会和人们的世界观具有巨大的威力。换句话说，只有当革命者高举达到革命理论顶峰的毛泽东思想旗帜，高举对建设社会主义社会和对全世界人类的解放斗争具有决定意义的毛泽东思想旗帜，革命才能取得胜利。
    维斯比说，在越南人民目前所进行的斗争中，全世界人民——包括正直的美国人民在内——的心是在越南人民一边的。他愤怒谴责美帝国主义最近轰炸河内和海防的严重罪行。他指出，这只能暴露他们的绝望和丑恶面目，只是更进一步揭穿了美帝国主义和现代修正主义所宣扬的“和平谈判”是一个大骗局。
    他说，我们要求美帝国主义军队立即从越南土地上撤出去。我们号召亚非作家，用鲜明、坚决和强烈的语言谴责美帝国主义的野蛮侵略，支持越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。
    他说，印度尼西亚的进步作家谴责美帝国主义者及其走狗和同谋者，假革命派以及现代修正主义者的阴谋。他指出，修正主义者大肆推销约翰逊政府早已破了产的“和平谈判”的货色，其目的就是为了实现同美帝国主义合作主宰世界，出卖越南人民。
    维斯比谈到印度尼西亚的局势时，愤怒地谴责纳苏蒂安—苏哈托军事政权镇压印度尼西亚进步力量的血腥罪行。他说，历史将永远不会饶恕他们，人民必将起来反抗。印度尼西亚的进步力量和革命力量经过艰苦的斗争和牺牲，必将克服一切困难，最后击败法西斯军事政权，取得斗争的胜利。
    他揭露苏联修正主义者支持纳苏蒂安—苏哈托的卑鄙行为。他说，在纳苏蒂安—苏哈托的反革命政变后，苏联政府还继续答应给这个法西斯政权以武器援助。这些援助是帮助印度尼西亚反动政权来屠杀印度尼西亚爱国者的。
    维斯比还谴责纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯独裁政权对中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的野蛮暴行，以及对在印度尼西亚的中国侨民的迫害。他说，这些犯罪行为在国际关系中是史无前例的。他指出，印度尼西亚右派势力的罪恶勾当，是为美帝国主义“遏制”中国的全球战略效劳的。
    他热烈支持亚非作家常设局会议最近发表的声明，谴责苏联修正主义者阴谋在巴库召开一个有亚非作家参加的会议。他说，这实际上等于非法地把第三届会议的地点由印度尼西亚迁到苏联的巴库。
    他说，由于印度尼西亚的局势，法西斯军事当局实行白色恐怖，第三届亚非作家会议不可能在印度尼西亚举行。维斯比说，他们作为印度尼西亚的革命作家，作为原本是第三届亚非作家会议的主人，建议第三届作家会议在中国举行。
    维斯比热情赞扬中国正在进行的波澜壮阔的文化大革命是史无前例的大事。他说，这场伟大的文化革命的舵手就是毛泽东主席。这一场有千百万工农兵和知识分子参加的文化大革命，必将对亚非各国人民的斗争吹来清新的空气。
