	Editor's Note: "The peasants of the Mao Zedong era dare to fight against the heavens and the earth; earthquakes are nothing more than paper tigers, nothing to be afraid of!" This is the bold and heroic statement of the people in the earthquake-stricken area of Xingtai. Why do they possess such fearless revolutionary spirit in the face of such a severe natural disaster? It is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that has given them tremendous encouragement. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, the wisest, and the greatest fighting force.

	Today, our newspaper selects and publishes a portion of the poems and stories from the earthquake-stricken area of Xingtai, where the people praise the Party and Chairman Mao and express their love for Chairman Mao's works. From here, one can see that the great Mao Zedong Thought is changing people's spiritual outlook and the appearance of our great motherland.

	Relying on the Sacred Book to Make Revolution

	Xīn Chāo

	Wang Luojiu, the team leader of the second production team in Meizhuang, is a poor peasant in his fifties. He has a special love for Chairman Mao's books.

	On the morning of March 8, when the earthquake occurred, Wang Luojiu rushed out of the house that was about to collapse, not taking any pots, pans, or bowls, but grabbing a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Team member Ma Lanhua asked him, "Why risk your life to grab just one book?" Luojiu replied, "Chairman Mao's works are sacred books. I will rely on this sacred book to make revolution!"

	Wang Luojiu was a laborer in the old society. He knew in his heart that Chairman Mao's books are the books for the laboring people to make revolution. In the past, relying on Chairman Mao's books, we achieved revolutionary victories; now and in the future, we must rely on Chairman Mao's books to wage class struggle, build socialism, and communism. For the convenience of study, he had his wife sew a large pocket on his jacket. His wife asked, "Why sew such a large pocket? What are you going to put in it?" Luojiu said, "To put the sacred book!" After the large pocket was sewn, Luojiu put the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" into it and said with satisfaction, "'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' by my side, ready to study at any time." Before meetings, he would ask someone to read a passage, and after meetings, he would ask someone to read another passage. During breaks in the fields, he would also take out the book and ask someone to read a passage. Wang Luojiu studied himself and also helped others study. Young people read Chairman Mao's works to him, and he told the young people about the hardships of the old society and class struggle. Under his influence, studying Chairman Mao's works became a trend in the village.

	"Whatever Chairman Mao says, I will do it." Wang Luojiu kept this sentence firmly in his heart. One evening, the higher authorities brought in a batch of relief flour. The accountant said, "Let's call everyone to come and distribute it. Distributing it tomorrow will affect production." Luojiu thought for a moment and said, "Chairman Mao teaches us in 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' to serve the people completely and thoroughly. Zhang Side and Norman Bethune are our examples. Today is an opportunity to learn and apply! Now the community members have worked hard all day, and some are about to rest. Don't let everyone run around. You weigh it out for each household, and I will deliver it door to door." The entire team of over thirty households, Luojiu carried the flour and delivered it door to door. A few days ago, during the wheat harvest, some wheat stems (straw ropes for bundling wheat) were needed, and the team's labor force was tight, with more needed the next day. Luojiu found a few old team members and worked overtime at night, making over five hundred jin of wheat stems. The next day, he got up early to ring the bell, leading the team members to the fields. The team members knew he hadn't slept well the night before and advised him to go back and rest. Luojiu said, "There are only a few wheat days in a year! This year's wheat days are different from previous years. This is the wheat we produced through self-reliance after the earthquake!"

	After the Cultural Revolution began, Luojiu and the community members, through studying Chairman Mao's works, opened their eyes. They wrote over a hundred big-character posters exposing and criticizing the monsters and demons. He also led the young people in the team to go with him to see the big-character posters. He educated the young people as he watched, showing his deep hatred for the class enemies and his boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao.

    靠着宝书干革命
    新超
    梅庄第二生产队队长王洛巨，是个五十多岁的老贫农。他对毛主席的书，特别热爱。
    三月八日清晨，地震发生的时候，王洛巨从快要倒塌的屋子里跑出来，锅碗瓢勺一件没拿，抢着拿出了一本《毛泽东著作选读》。社员马兰花问他，为什么豁着老命只抢一本书？洛巨说，“毛主席著作是宝书，我要靠着这本宝书干革命哩！”
    王洛巨在旧社会是扛长活的，他心里明白：毛主席的书，是咱们劳动人民闹革命的书。过去，靠毛主席的书，取得了革命的胜利；现在和将来，更要靠毛主席的书，搞阶级斗争，建设社会主义和共产主义。为了学习方便，他让老伴给他在褂子上缝一个大口袋，老伴问道：“你缝这么大的口袋，要装啥哩？”洛巨说：“装宝书！”大口袋缝好后，洛巨把《毛泽东著作选读》往口袋里一装，满意地说：“‘毛选’身边带，随时学起来。”开会前，他找人念一段，散会后还要找人念一段。在地头休息时，他也要把书掏出来，请别人念一段。王洛巨自己学，也帮助别人学，青年人给他念毛主席著作，他给青年人讲旧社会的苦，讲阶级斗争。在他的带动下，村里学习毛主席著作成了风气。
    “毛主席怎么说，我就怎么做。”王洛巨把这一句话牢牢记在心里。有一天晚上，上级给运来一部分救灾白面，会计说：“咱把大伙喊来分了吧，明天分要影响生产。”洛巨想了想说：“毛主席在《为人民服务》里教导我们要‘完全’、‘彻底’地为人民服务。张思德、白求恩就是咱的榜样。今天可是个活学活用的机会！现在社员们劳累了一天，有的快要休息了，别让大伙来回跑了。你一户一户称出来，我按户给送去。”全队三十多户人家，洛巨背着白面，挨门挨户地送了去。前几天麦收，需要打一部分麦腰（捆麦子的草绳），队上劳力很紧，第二天又等着用。洛巨就找了几个老社员，晚上加班，打了五百多斤麦腰。第二天，他又起早打钟，领着社员下地了。社员们知道他晚上没睡好，劝他回去休息，洛巨说：“一年能有几个麦天？今年的麦天跟往年又不同，这是咱们地震后生产自救出来的麦子呵！”
    文化大革命运动开始后，洛巨和社员们经过学习毛主席著作，擦亮了眼睛，他们一共写了一百多张揭露和批判牛鬼蛇神的大字报。他还领着队里的年青人跟他一起去看大字报，他一边看一边对青年人进行教育，表现了他对阶级敌人的无比仇恨，对党和毛主席的无限热爱。
