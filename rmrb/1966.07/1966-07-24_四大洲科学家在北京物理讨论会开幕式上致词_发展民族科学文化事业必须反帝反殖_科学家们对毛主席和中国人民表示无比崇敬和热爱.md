In the grand opening ceremony of the 1966 Summer Physics Discussion Conference held today, 28 scientists from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania delivered speeches, warmly congratulating the successful convening of this conference and expressing their heartfelt wishes for its complete success. Many scientists pointed out that scientists and people from the four continents must oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism and must wage a struggle to win and defend national independence in order to build and develop their own scientific and cultural undertakings.

In their speeches, many scientists expressed their deep respect and boundless love for Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese people under Chairman Mao's leadership. Some scientists shouted in Chinese, which they had just learned, "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long live the friendship between the people of Africa and China!" Some scientists praised Mao Zedong Thought as a beacon, whose radiance illuminates the hopes of all oppressed peoples.

Vietnamese scientist Vu Nhu Quynh said in his speech that the fraternal Chinese people, under the glorious banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, have given great assistance to the Vietnamese people, which is a manifestation of the fighting solidarity and lofty proletarian internationalism.

He pointed out that President Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Nation" is a sacred call to the nation, representing the will and feelings of the entire nation, and is the battle cry issued by the supreme commander. Facing the U.S. policy of expanding the war of aggression, the Vietnamese people have only one will: to fight, to fight fiercely, to fight to the final victory. He said that Vietnamese physicists are devoting all their efforts to research and teaching, serving the production and struggle of the motherland.

He pointed out that this conference is a good opportunity to strengthen the unity and cooperation among physicists from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania, and this unity and cooperation is an indispensable condition for the people of various countries to oppose imperialism and colonialism and develop scientific and cultural undertakings.

Uruguayan scientist Grunbaum, in his speech, thanked the Chinese people for providing an opportunity for scientists from various countries to exchange views, thoughts, and opinions on common problems during the conference.

Egyptian scientist Osman, in his speech, talked about the necessity and importance of this conference, saying that many of the countries participating in this conference have suffered from the exploitation of imperialism and old and new colonialism. Our country firmly believes that we must rely on ourselves and cooperate with the friendly people of various countries to overcome the difficulties of the colonial era.

Ugandan scientist Mulani, in his speech, expressed his belief that this conference will definitely achieve great success and will realize the goal of exchanging scientific knowledge and research results among scientists from so many countries. He praised the spirit embodied in this conference and wished it a complete success. He said that the People's Republic of China is a typical example of great progress in all aspects, including science. He firmly believed that the contributions of Chinese physicists to this conference would also be remarkable.

Tunisian scientist Zammali said in his speech that we participated in this conference because we believe that the conference will be beneficial to all participants.

He emphasized that through mutual introduction of scientific research results, mutual understanding and common progress can be promoted. He said that the Tunisian people are eager to use the continuous achievements of science and technology to develop their national economy.

The physicist from Togo said in his speech that none of us is unaware of China's position in the history of the whole world, especially in the struggle for true national independence. The people of the world are watching with great enthusiasm everything that happens in China, especially what it does for the interests of the people of Asia, Latin America, and Africa, the so-called "underdeveloped countries." The Beijing Science Conference is a proof and a great victory, which has advanced the progress of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania in the fields of society, culture, economy, and science. This physics conference is a continuation of the Beijing Science Conference, and it will play an important role in the struggle for the prosperity and gradual development of the so-called "underdeveloped countries." In this regard, the Chinese people and government are a good example for us.

Syrian scientist Azzam said in his speech that this conference is "another step in the struggle of the weak nations to unite and resolutely oppose colonialism. This struggle will not stop until the old and new colonialism dies out in the world. Therefore, the Syrian delegation, on behalf of the Syrian people, seizes this opportunity to announce full and absolute support for all liberation movements in the world, first and foremost the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the Palestinian people, as well as the liberation movements in Latin America."

Sudanese scientist Hegazi said in his speech that two years ago, 367 scientists from 44 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania gathered in Beijing, writing a new page in the history of science. This physics conference also gives us a great historical mission. We not only have to set an example for future conferences but also have to add a corresponding page to the one written by our brothers in 1964. I sincerely hope and fully believe that we will be worthy of this mission.

Sierra Leonean scientist Jalloh said in his speech that the countries of the scientists gathered here have all suffered from some form of colonialism, imperialism, and exploitation, and some form of humiliation and other indignities that followed. For a long time, the tricks and deceit of the colonialists have kept us far away from the fortress of scientific progress. All aspects of our lives have been suppressed and degraded as "backward" and "uncivilized." But I would like to remind you that the achievements of nuclear physicists in the People's Republic of China and other countries have exposed the false notion spread by the capitalist and imperialist world that we cannot engage in creative thinking activities. We are gathered here, countries large and small, but the exchange of ideas will definitely promote the progress and development of science in our various countries. For this, he especially congratulated the People's Republic of China for the convening of this conference.

Jalloh strongly condemned the aggressive crimes of American imperialism in Vietnam. He said that when we consider that the United States, thousands of miles away from Vietnam, is not doing anything else but to perpetuate the capitalist system and carry out the imperialist policy of massacre, we can easily see who our friends are and who our enemies are.

Jalloh ended his speech by shouting in Chinese, which he had just learned, "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long live the friendship between Africa and China!" At this moment, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause.

Pakistani scientist Siddiqui said in his speech, "We are gathered here in the spirit of goodwill and cooperation among the countries, especially among the countries of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania, to promote the development of science through the exchange of scientific and technological ideas and the discussion of common problems. Holding such conferences in developing countries will help to spark a scientific revolution."

Moroccan scientist Wazzani said in his speech that he was convinced that this conference, attended by scientists from the four continents, would overcome all obstacles and difficulties for a common noble cause. We rely on ourselves to develop science and technology, and this fact shows us the way and gives us the means. Our dreams today will become a reality tomorrow.

The Mexican scientist said in his speech that this conference provides us with a good opportunity to personally learn about some of the achievements of the Chinese people, who have a cultural history of several thousand years, and their achievements in recent years. He said that they would do their best to contribute to the success of this conference and promised to bring back to their country all the experiences that could be beneficial to the Mexican people.

Japanese scientist Yoshiki Nakanishi said in his speech that this physics conference will be conducted in the spirit of the 1964 Beijing Science Conference. The 1964 Beijing Science Conference made the Japanese scientists feel most moved because it was held in the spirit of complete mutual respect and mutual assistance. This is something unprecedented in the history of international scientific conferences and is a milestone; such a spirit is very necessary for the success of international scientific conferences.

He said that in order to develop scientific research in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania, it is necessary to eliminate various forms of imperialist aggression and strive to win and defend national independence.

Iraqi scientist Jita expressed his firm belief that this conference would further consolidate and accelerate the cooperation of the peoples of the four continents in the field of science and technology. This mutual cooperation is one of the means of struggle against all kinds of imperialism and all forms of aggression. He said that the long-standing slogan of "scientific monopoly" has obviously become pure nonsense. The facts prove that the physicists and technicians from the four continents participating in this conference can do what others can do, especially after breaking away from the past darkness and chains and becoming the masters of their own countries, they can do it even better. Jita also highly appreciated the democratic spirit demonstrated by the host country's scientists in the way they organized this conference. He said that making every participant feel responsible for the success of this conference, we are indeed deeply impressed by this.

Indonesian scientist Suharyo said in his speech that this physics conference is not only of great significance for the development of this particular science in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania, but will also make a great contribution to the development of physics in the world. It has given a blow to the myth that physics, especially nuclear physics, is monopolized by certain major countries outside Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania. The scientists of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania, with their current scientific activities, have shown to the world that they are also capable of discussing scientific issues at the most advanced stage of development. In this regard, we must pay attention to the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people and scientists, who recently successfully conducted a nuclear explosion test containing thermonuclear materials. This great achievement is due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the brilliant thought of Chairman Mao Zedong for the development of Chinese science. This event will undoubtedly enhance the confidence of progressive scientists in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania that the peoples and scientists of these regions have great talents and can reach the highest level in the field of science, including physics.

He said that the progressive peoples and scientists of the world, especially those in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania, are also happy and proud of China's brilliant achievements. We are proud because the Chinese people and scientists, with their brilliant achievements, have not only enhanced the prestige of the Chinese people and scientists in the hearts of the world's people but also enhanced the prestige of the peoples and scientists of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania. Due to this great achievement, the imperialists and modern revisionists can no longer arbitrarily pursue their policy of "nuclear blackmail" against the world's peoples. Nuclear weapons in the hands of a socialist country like China are a reliable guarantee against the nuclear war planned by the imperialists.

In his speech, he strongly condemned the inhuman atrocities of American imperialism in Vietnam, using chemical poisons and gases and implementing the "burn, destroy, and kill" policy in the dirty war they launched there, and expressed his complete support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people.

In his speech, he exposed and condemned the Nasution-Suharto clique, which, with the assistance and instructions of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, seized power and established a fascist dictatorship against the people and democracy, brutally suppressing the progressive and democratic movements of the people, and carrying out the most vicious racist anti-Chinese terrorist actions.

Guinean scientist Sidi in his speech praised the host country for organizing this conference so perfectly, "This excellent organization work eloquently proves that China attaches importance to cultural issues and the international solidarity of the peoples of various countries who have long suffered from the oppression of evil forces."

He said that the representatives of various countries will express through this conference their will to forever get rid of all spiritual and cultural subordination and their strong desire to eliminate the ignorance that imperialism has long used to oppose the liberation of our peoples. This conference will strengthen the unity and brotherly friendship of all those who are determined to fight against all forms of foreign rule until final victory, using various means. Their unshakable will is to eliminate the spreaders of lies and hatred, the instigators of discord, and those who attempt to destroy our cultural heritage, that is, international imperialism. No matter how imperialism thinks, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will never retreat, never despair, but will join hands to work together to show the world that mastering science is no longer the privilege of a few, and we have all achieved it.

Finally, he warmly praised the People's Republic of China's love for the world revolutionary cause, its brotherly friendship with the peoples suffering from colonial rule, and its immeasurable contributions in the field of creative thought under the leadership of its great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong. He said that China has set up, and will continue to be, an example of the belief that brave, progressive, and hardworking peoples of various countries will surely defeat the evil forces.

Ecuadorian scientist Romero enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought in his speech. He said that Chairman Mao has made revolutionary thought into a doctrine, and this doctrine is spreading steadily and firmly in the world, like a lighthouse, illuminating the hopes of all oppressed peoples.

He said that the Chinese revolution, in just over a decade, has developed the economic and cultural level of the Chinese people to an undeniable height; it enjoys higher prestige than other revolutions in the world and is in a key position in world politics; it has taken on the burden of supporting the heroic Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism; it supports the revolutions of various countries and extends a friendly hand to the peoples of various countries who are oppressed economically.

When talking about this physics conference, he said that the two of us from Ecuador traveled thousands of miles to get here to learn from famous scientists and understand what a people who trust their own teachers and have confidence in themselves can do. He also pointed out that the time for all righteous people to rise up and overthrow the imperialists who are trying to strangle them has come, and they will definitely overthrow the imperialists.

Congolese (Brazzaville) scientist Emmanuel pointed out in his speech that this physics conference should be viewed from the perspective of the anti-imperialist struggle. Imperialists are aware of the role that the development of science and technology plays in a society, so they always try to block our path to success. For a long time, they have claimed that the countries of Asia, Africa, Oceania, and Latin America are incapable of doing various sciences. Once the revolution is victorious, the Chinese leaders pointed out that only by relying on one's own strength can one consolidate the victory. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have made great scientific progress at a high level. These achievements are a serious blow to imperialism.

He also pointed out that the Chinese people have achieved success completely relying on their own firmness and determination, and the Chinese experience can be an example for countries still suffering from neo-colonialism.

The scientist strongly condemned the aggressive crimes of American imperialism in Vietnam and, on behalf of the Congolese people, paid tribute to the Vietnamese people who are fighting against the most ferocious imperialism of our time. He said that the U.S. intervention and aggression in Vietnam are unprecedented, despicable, and barbaric. But the Vietnamese people will win, and American imperialism will surely perish! He said that the Congolese people fully support the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, unconditionally condemn the banditry of the American killers, and demand that the U.S. troops unconditionally withdraw from Vietnamese territory. He called on all oppressed peoples to resolutely support the just cause of the Vietnamese people.

Colombian scientist Gamba Escalante said in his speech that he believed that "the links established today between scientists from various countries of the world will produce more and more results, helping mutual understanding among the peoples of various countries." In his speech, he talked about the need to understand the feelings of the Chinese people well. This feeling inspires them to establish mutual assistance relations with the peoples of the world.

He said, "I will bring back to my country the wish of China to contribute to the new world and the cooperation of a young nation that has made great efforts for liberation and dignity, the joy and will of the people of this country to discover new social paths, and the hard-working enthusiasm of the people of this country to discover new social paths."

Finally, he enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao, saying, "Mao Zedong is a warrior, a poet, a writer, a politician, and a social activist. He has brilliantly expressed the fighting will of the Chinese people, which marks a decisive era in Chinese history."

Chilean scientist Alvial thanked the People's Republic of China for providing a valuable opportunity for Chilean scientists to exchange ideas with Chinese scientists and colleagues from various countries attending the conference in the spirit of free exchange of ideas, which is beneficial to the development of science in various countries. He said that supporting the efforts of the People's Republic of China to cooperate scientifically with various countries is also the first step, firm and responsible, to study the problems of scientific education and scientific development in a new spirit.

Sri Lankan scientist Kannangara said in his speech that China is a country with a glorious history and inspiring spirit. He expressed his admiration for the efforts of the Chinese people in popularizing education and science and wished that China's efforts to lead in scientific thought and invention, as in the past, would be successful. When talking about China undertaking the enormous task of hosting this physics conference, he expressed his deep gratitude and appreciation. He said that such conferences would help the emergence of new ideas.

Cambodian scientist Chhum said in his speech that this conference once again concretely and convincingly proved that the scientists and peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania want to show the world that science and technology are no longer monopolized by imperialist countries. In all countries under imperialist rule, imperialism always keeps the peoples of these countries in a humiliating state of ignorance, using science for their conquest and aggression. Currently, American imperialism and its puppets in Saigon and Bangkok are constantly invading Cambodia's borders, trying to destroy our independence and our policy of peaceful neutrality. It is further fanning the flames of war to invade Laos. It is barbarically occupying Chinese territory Taiwan, threatening the People's Republic of China. It is occupying South Korea, obstructing the Korean people from unifying their country. In Vietnam, American imperialists are waging a barbaric war of aggression against the Vietnamese people.

To create death and poverty, American imperialists have turned the achievements of science and technology into bombs, incendiary bombs, and chemical poisons. But we know that despite their apparent technological superiority, they will never be able to defeat the united Vietnamese people, and they will suffer a shameful defeat in front of the people of the world.

He pointed out that the scientists of the four continents gathered here, in the spirit of equality and democracy, exchanged their experiences. This fact shows that the countries of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania are winning victories in their struggle against the policy of ignorance imposed by imperialism on the scientific front. They draw strength from this struggle to consolidate the independence of their respective countries. The conference held in Beijing has special significance because the People's Republic of China has reached a stage of development today, which is considered to be at the forefront of new independent countries in the fields of science and technology. The People's Republic of China, starting from the ruined economy caused by the bloody plunder of imperialism, overcame countless difficulties in the shortest possible time and reached a high level of technology. Its previous nuclear tests and recent nuclear explosion tests containing thermonuclear materials have forever ended the atomic monopoly of certain major countries. China's achievements are mainly due to the fruitful results of the policy of self-reliance. The experience of our Chinese brothers greatly inspires us and sets an example for us in national construction.

Chhum then introduced the achievements of Cambodia in education, technology, and science under the continuous promotion of the national leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk.

Myanmar scientist U Kaung Min said in his speech that this conference, attended by scientists from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania, will have great value for all participating countries. These scientists will exchange information on the achievements and experiences of scientific research, which will not only contribute to the further development of science but also strengthen the friendly relations among the countries of the four continents.

He also praised the long-standing, brotherly friendship between China and Myanmar. He said that Myanmar scientists, as close friends, are very proud of the great achievements of Chinese scientists.

Australian scientist Roberts said in his speech that we must not entrust the pursuit of truth and the development of technology to the big powers alone. Every region in the world has its own problems, especially those related to its economic and geographical conditions. The development of science is so important that we must not let it slip out of our control. In this regard, losing independence is as harmful as in other aspects.

The Argentinean scientist said in his speech that we cannot separate science from politics, otherwise, we will make serious mistakes. We can only develop our country's science and true national culture by struggling with the people and winning national independence. He said that all scientific developments relying on imperialist "aid" are false and doomed to fail.

He said that we must not make the mistake of regarding science as a benevolent fairy. We have had enough experience of how imperialists use scientists. All honest scientists in the world must understand without exception that we can only strive for the liberation of the people. We clearly know that when science develops in capitalist countries, it is always used to oppress the proletariat and maintain colonial rule.

Algerian scientist Youssef emphasized the importance of this conference in his speech. He said that this is held after the People's Republic of China has achieved great scientific and technological achievements. Participating in this conference allows us to understand the efforts made in the fields of science and technology that form the basis of these victories and to measure the great leap made by the Chinese people, which is an inspiration and an example for the peoples of the four continents.

He said that through this conference, we can exchange experiences on common aspects, exchange views with scientists from various countries, and lay the foundation for effective cooperation among our researchers.

He pointed out that Algeria has not forgotten that the threat of imperialism still hangs over the four continents. Algeria pays tribute to the heroic spirit shown by the peoples of Asia and Africa who are still under imperialist rule, especially to the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting for liberation.

He also hoped that by the end of the conference, the friendly relations and cooperation in the field of science among the countries of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania would be further strengthened.

The representative of the East African Science Academy, Gaisi, said in his speech that he, on behalf of the East African Science Academy, expressed the best wishes for the conference. He said that the science and technology of Asia and Africa have long been backward, but today these countries have awakened and are advancing. This international science conference held in Beijing will help these advancing countries to understand each other and the development of science.

Afghan scientist Ebadi said in his speech that China, this great country, under the guidance and leadership of the great figure of Asia, Chairman Mao Zedong, has made great progress, which deeply impresses us. We sincerely congratulate China and the Chinese people. We know about China's progress through radio broadcasts and newspapers and magazines sent from China. Today we have the opportunity to see this progress with our own eyes, and we are extremely happy.

    四大洲科学家在北京物理讨论会开幕式上致词
    发展民族科学文化事业必须反帝反殖
    科学家们对毛主席和中国人民表示无比崇敬和热爱
    新华社二十三日讯　在今天隆重举行的北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会开幕式上，来自亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲的二十八位科学家先后致词，热烈祝贺这次讨论会的胜利召开和热烈预祝这次会议圆满成功。许多科学家指出，四大洲各国科学家和人民要建立和发展民族的科学文化事业，就必须反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，必须进行争取和维护民族独立的斗争。
    在致词中，不少科学家对毛泽东主席和在毛主席领导下的中国人民表示无比崇敬，无限热爱。有的科学家在会上用刚学会的中国话高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！”“非洲与中国人民之间的友谊万岁！”有的科学家赞颂毛泽东思想是灯塔，以它的光辉照亮了所有被压迫人民的希望。
    越南科学家魏如昆嵩在致词中说，兄弟的中国人民在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光荣旗帜下，给予越南人民以巨大的援助，这是具有战斗团结和崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神的援助。
    他指出，胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》是祖国神圣的号召，代表整个民族的意志和情感，是最高总司令发出的冲锋的号角。面对美国扩大侵略战争的政策，越南人民只有一个意志：打，狠狠地打，打到最后胜利。他说，越南物理学家倾尽全力从事研究和教学工作，为祖国的生产和战斗服务。
    他指出，这次讨论会是加强亚非拉和大洋洲的物理学家之间的团结合作的一个良好机会，而这种团结合作是各国人民反帝反殖、发展科学文化事业的不可缺少的条件。
    乌拉圭科学家格龙波内在致词中感谢中国人民给各国科学家提供机会，使他们很多人带着共同的问题在会议的过程中互相交流观点、思想和意见。
    阿联科学家奥斯曼在致词中谈到这次讨论会的必要性和重要性时说，参加这次讨论会的许多国家都遭受过帝国主义和新老殖民主义的剥削，我们国家深信必须依靠自己，以及同友好的各国人民的合作来克服殖民主义苦难岁月的影响。
    乌干达科学家穆拉尼在致词时表示相信，这次讨论会一定会获得巨大成功，并且会实现使来自如此众多国家的科学家们彼此交流科学知识和研究成果的目的。他赞扬这次讨论会所秉承的精神，并祝它圆满成功。他说，中华人民共和国，是在各方面，包括科学在内，取得巨大进步的典型榜样。他深信中国物理学家们对这次会议的贡献将同样令人注目。
    突尼斯科学家兹迈利在致词中说，我们参加这次会议是由于我们确信会议将对全体与会者是有益的。
    他强调，要通过彼此介绍科学研究的成果，促进互相了解，共同提高。他说，突尼斯人民迫切希望利用技术科学不断取得的成果来发展本国经济。
    多哥物理学家在致词中说，我们之间没有一个人不知道中国在整个世界历史中，特别是在争取真正的民族独立的斗争中所占的地位。全世界人民以很大的热情来注视中国所发生的一切事情，首先是它为亚洲、拉丁美洲和非洲所谓“不发达国家”人民的利益所做的事。北京科学讨论会就是一个证明，又是一个大胜利，它使亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、大洋洲各国在社会、文化、经济和科学发展的道路上前进了一步。而这次物理讨论会是北京科学讨论会的继续，它将对争取那些所谓“不发达国家”的繁荣和逐渐发展起重要作用。在这方面，中国人民和中国政府对我们来说是个好榜样。
    叙利亚科学家阿扎姆在致词中说，这次讨论会，“是各弱小民族同心协力顽强地反对殖民主义的斗争道路上的又一个步骤，这一斗争不到新老殖民主义在全世界死亡决不停止。为此，叙利亚代表团代表叙利亚人民，借此机会宣布全面地、绝对地支持世界上所有的解放运动，首先是越南人民和巴勒斯坦人民的斗争以及拉丁美洲各国的解放运动。”
    苏丹科学家赫加齐在致词中说，两年前，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲四十四个国家的三百六十七位科学家在北京集会，写下了科学史上新的一页。这次物理讨论会，“也赋予我们一个巨大的历史使命，我们不仅要为未来的讨论会树一块样板，而且还必须在我们的弟兄们在一九六四年写下的一页之上，再加上与之相应的一页。我殷切希望并完全相信，我们将无愧于这一使命。”
    塞拉勒窝内科学家贾洛在致词中说，聚集在这里的科学家们的国家全都遭受过某种形式的殖民主义、帝国主义的压迫，某种形式的剥削和其他随之而来的耻辱。长期以来，殖民主义者的诡计和欺骗，把我们同科学进步的堡垒隔得远远的。我们的一切方面都遭到压制并被贬斥为“落后的”和“不文明的”。但我愿意提醒你们，中华人民共和国以及其他许多国家的核物理学家的成就已经揭穿了资本主义和帝国主义世界所散布的、以为我们不能从事创造性思维活动的错误想法。我们在这里聚集一堂，国家有大有小，但相互交流思想肯定会促进我们各国科学的进步和发展。为此，他特别为这次讨论会的召开向中华人民共和国致敬。
    贾洛强烈谴责了美帝国主义对越南的侵略罪行。他说，当我们考虑到美国在离它万里之外的越南，不是为别的，只是为了永远保持资本主义制度和推行帝国主义的屠杀政策的时候，我们就不难看出，谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人。
    贾洛在致词结束时，用刚学会的中国话高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！”“非洲与中国人民之间的友谊万岁！”这时，全场响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    巴基斯坦科学家萨卡尔在致词中说，“我们本着各国，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲各国的善意和合作的精神，在这里聚会，目的在于通过科学和技术思想的交流和共同问题的讨论，来促进科学发展。在正在发展的国家举行这类会议将有助于引起科学革命。”
    摩洛哥科学家瓦扎尼在致词时表示确信，由四大洲科学家参加的这次讨论会，为了共同的崇高事业，必将克服一切阻碍和困难。我们靠自己来发展科学和技术，这一事实向我们指出了道路，使我们有了办法。我们今天的幻想明天定将变成事实。
    墨西哥科学家在致词中说，这次讨论会向我们提供了这样一个好机会，使我们能够亲身了解一些关于具有几千年文化历史的中国人民的一些情况和他们在近几年来所取得的一些成就。他说，我们将尽最大的能力，为这次讨论会的成功作出贡献，并向你们保证，把在会议上交流的一切可能有益于墨西哥人民的经验带回国去。
    日本科学家野上茂吉郎在致词中说，这次物理讨论会，将本着一九六四年北京科学讨论会的基本精神来进行。一九六四年北京科学讨论会，使我们日本科学家最感动的是，它是在彻底的互相尊重、互相帮助的精神下召开的。这是历来的国际科学会议上，未曾见过的、划时代的事情；为了使国际科学会议取得成功，这种精神是非常必要的。
    他说，为了发展亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲的科学研究工作，必须排除帝国主义种种形式的侵略，争取和维护民族独立。
    伊拉克科学家吉塔表示坚信，这次讨论会将会进一步巩固和加速四大洲各国人民在科学技术领域中的合作。这种相互合作正是反对一切种类的帝国主义和反对一切形式的侵略的斗争手段之一。他说，长期流行的“科学垄断”的口号，已显然成为纯粹的无稽之谈。事实证明，参加这次讨论会的四大洲的物理学家和技术人员，能够做到别人所能做到的事，特别是在摆脱了过去的黑暗和锁链、成为自己国家的主人之后，更能这样做。吉塔还高度赞赏东道国的科学家们在组织这次讨论会的方式上所表现出来的民主精神。他说，使每一个参加者都对这次讨论会的成功有责任感，我们对此的确有深刻的印象。
    印度尼西亚科学家苏哈里约在致词时说，这次物理讨论会，不仅是对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲的这门特殊科学的发展有巨大的意义，而且对全世界物理学的发展也会有重大贡献。它对于那种认为物理学，特别是核物理学，已为亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲等地区以外的某些大国所垄断的神话给了当头一棒。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲的科学家以他们目前的科学活动向全世界表明，他们也有能力讨论处于最新发展阶段的科学问题。在这方面我们必须注意到中国人民和科学家的辉煌成就，他们最近成功地进行了包含有热核材料的核爆炸试验。这一巨大的成就要归功于中国共产党的正确领导和毛泽东主席发展中国科学的光辉思想的正确实现。这一事件必将增强亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲进步科学家的这一信心，这些地区的人民和科学家拥有巨大的才能，能够在包括物理学在内的科学领域内达到最高水平。
    他说，全世界、特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲的进步人民和科学家对中国的这一光辉成就也都感到高兴和自豪。我们感到自豪，因为中国人民和科学家以他们这一光辉成就，不仅在世界人民的心目中提高了中国人民和科学家的威望，而且提高了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲的人民和科学家的威望。由于这一巨大成就，帝国主义者和现代修正主义者再也不能一意孤行地奉行他们反对世界人民的“核讹诈”政策了。掌握在中国这样的社会主义国家手中的核武器，是防止帝国主义者所策划的核战争的可靠保证。
    他在致词中强烈谴责美帝国主义在越南所发动的肮脏战争中使用化学毒剂和毒气以及实行“烧光、毁光和杀光”政策的惨无人道的行径，并且表示完全支持越南人民的正义斗争。
    他在致词中揭露和谴责纳苏蒂安—苏哈托集团，在美国中央情报局的协助和指使下，篡夺了政权并且建立了反人民、反民主的法西斯独裁，残暴地镇压人民的进步和民主运动，并且进行最恶毒的种族主义的反华恐怖行动。
    几内亚科学家赛杜在致词中赞扬东道国把这次讨论会组织得十分完美，“这种出色的组织工作雄辩地证明了中国重视文化问题，重视长期以来遭受邪恶势力压迫的各国人民之间的国际团结。”
    他说，各国代表团将通过这次讨论会向全世界表达他们要永远摆脱一切精神上和文化上的从属地位的意志，要清除帝国主义长期用来反对我们各国人民解放的愚昧主义的强烈愿望。这次讨论会将加强一切决心为了反对各种形式的外国统治，直到最后胜利而用各种方法进行斗争的人们的团结和兄弟友谊，他们不可动摇的意志是要消灭谎言和仇恨的散布者、挑拨离间者和企图破坏我们文化遗产的人，即国际帝国主义。不管帝国主义会怎样想，亚非拉各国人民绝没有退却，绝没有自暴自弃，而是决心携手共同努力，向全世界表明：掌握科学已不再是少数人的特权，而我们都已能办到了。
    最后，他热烈赞颂中华人民共和国对世界革命事业的热爱，它同受殖民统治的人民的兄弟友谊，以及在它的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，在创造性思想方面所做出的不可估量的贡献。他说，中国树立了，而且今后仍将是勇敢的、争取进步的、热爱劳动的各国人民必将战胜邪恶势力的信念的范例。
    厄瓜多尔科学家罗梅罗在致词中热情赞颂了毛泽东思想。他说，毛主席使革命的思想成为学说，这个学说正在世界上逐步地、坚定地传播开来，它象一座灯塔，以它的光辉照亮了所有被压迫人民的希望。
    他说，中国革命仅仅在十多年的时间内就使中国人民的经济和文化水平发展到了不容置疑的高度；她在全世界比其他国家的革命享有更高的威望，居于世界政治的关键地位；她担负起了支持英雄的越南人民所进行的反对美帝国主义斗争的重担；她支持各国革命，并向在经济上受到压迫的各国人民伸出友好的双手。
    他在谈到这次物理讨论会时说，我们两个厄瓜多尔人远涉重洋来到这里，是为了向著名的科学家学习和了解一个信赖自己导师和对自己具有信心的人民所能做的一切。他还指出，一切正直的人们起来打倒企图扼杀他们的帝国主义者的时刻已经临近了，他们一定能打倒帝国主义者。
    刚果（布）科学家埃曼纽埃尔在致词中指出，应当从反帝斗争的角度来看待这次物理讨论会。帝国主义者意识到科学和技术的发展在一个社会中所起的作用，因此，总是设法堵塞我们取得成功的道路，很久以来他们就声称亚洲、非洲、大洋洲和拉丁美洲各国是没有能力搞各门科学的。革命一取得胜利，中国领导人就指出，只能依靠自己的力量来巩固胜利。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下取得了高水平的巨大科学进步。这些成绩都是对帝国主义的严重打击。
    他又指出，中国人民完全依靠自己的坚定性和决心取得了成功，中国的经验可以成为还受新殖民主义之害的国家的榜样。
    这位科学家强烈谴责美帝国主义侵略越南的罪行，并代表刚果人民向正在与我们时代最凶恶的帝国主义进行搏斗的越南人民致敬。他说，美国对越南的干涉和侵略是史无前例的，卑鄙和野蛮的。但是，越南人民必胜，美帝国主义必定灭亡！他说，刚果人民完全支持越南人民的英勇斗争，无保留地谴责美国杀人犯的强盗行为，要求美国军队无条件地撤出越南领土。呼吁所有被压迫人民坚决支持越南人民的正义事业。
    哥伦比亚科学家甘巴·埃斯卡利翁在致词中表示相信，“世界各国科学家之间今天建立起来的联系产生越来越多的结果，有助于各国人民之间的互相了解。”他在致词中谈到，必须很好地理解中国人民的感情。这种感情鼓舞他们同世界各国人民建立互助关系。
    他说，“我将把中国要为新世界贡献力量和相互合作的愿望，把为了解放和尊严而付出了巨大努力的一个年轻国家的人民的欢乐和意志，把这个国家的人民发现新的社会道路的埋头苦干的热情带回我的国家。”
    最后，他热情地赞扬了毛主席，他说，“毛泽东是战士、是诗人、是作家、是政治家和社会活动家，他杰出地表达了中国人民的斗争意志，这种斗争意志标志着中国历史上的一个决定性的时代。”
    智利科学家阿尔维亚尔在致词中感谢中华人民共和国给智利科学家提供宝贵的机会，来同中国的科学家以及与会的各国同事在自由交流思想的愿望下进行交谈，以利于各国科学事业的发展。他说，支持中华人民共和国同各国进行科学合作的努力，也就是坚定而负责地迈出了第一步，以便本着新的精神来研究科学教育和科学发展的问题。
    锡兰科学家坎南加拉致词说，中国是一个既具有光荣历史又激励人心的国家。他对中国人民在普及教育和科学方面所作的努力表示钦佩，并祝中国象往昔一样，在科学思想和创造发明方面居于领先地位所作的努力取得成功。他在谈到中国承担了这次物理讨论会的东道主的巨大任务时表示非常感谢和赞赏。他说，这样的讨论会将有助于新思想的出现。
    柬埔寨科学家吉春在致词中说，这次讨论会又一次具体地令人信服地证明，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲的科学家和人民要向全世界表明科学和技术已经不再只由帝国主义国家所垄断了。在一切受帝国主义统治的国家内，帝国主义总是使这些国家的人民处于侮辱性的蒙昧状态，他们利用科学为他们的征服和侵略服务。当前，美帝国主义及其西贡和曼谷的走狗天天侵犯柬埔寨的边境，竭力破坏我们的独立和我们的和平中立政策，它正在进一步点燃侵略老挝的战争火焰，它野蛮地占领中国领土台湾，威胁中华人民共和国，它占领着南朝鲜，阻挠朝鲜人民统一自己的国家。在越南，美帝国主义者正在对越南人民进行着一场野蛮的侵略战争。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    为了制造死亡和贫困，美帝国主义者把科学技术成果变成了炸弹、燃烧弹和化学毒气。但是，我们知道，尽管他们拥有表面上的技术优势，但他们永远不可能战胜同仇敌忾的越南人民，他们必将在全世界人民面前遭到可耻的下场。
    他指出，四大洲的科学家聚集一堂，本着平等和民主的精神，交流他们的经验，这件事说明，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲各国在科学战线上同帝国主义强加的愚昧政策的斗争中正在赢得胜利。他们从这场战斗中吸取力量来巩固各自国家的独立。讨论会在北京举行具有特殊的意义，因为中华人民共和国发展到今天的阶段，已被认为在科学和技术方面，站在新独立国家的前列。中华人民共和国从帝国主义血腥掠夺所造成的残破的经济情况出发，用最短的时间克服了无数困难，达到了高度的技术水平。它以前进行的核试验和最近含有热核材料的核爆炸试验，永远结束了某些大国的原子垄断。中国所以取得这些成就主要是由于中国遵循自力更生为主的方针所取得的丰硕成果。中国兄弟的经验大大地鼓舞了我们，给我们在国家建设方面树立了榜样。
    吉春团长接着介绍了柬埔寨在国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王不断地推动下，在教育、技术和科学方面所取得的成就。
    缅甸科学家吴叫敏在致词中说，由亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲的科学家参加的这次讨论会对所有参加国来说，都会有巨大的价值。这些科学家就科学研究的成就和经验交流情况，不但会对科学的进一步发展作出贡献，而且也会增强四大洲这些国家的友好关系。
    他还赞扬中国缅甸两国之间悠久的、兄弟般的友谊。他说，缅甸科学家，作为亲密的朋友，对中华人民共和国科学家的伟大成就感到十分自豪。
    澳大利亚科学家罗伯茨在致词中说，我们决不能把追求真理和发展技术的工作仅仅委之于大国。世界上每一个地区有它自己的问题，特别是与它的经济和地理条件相联系的问题。科学发展是如此重要，我们决不让它脱离我们的控制。在这一方面丧失独立正象在其他方面一样有害。
    阿根廷科学家在致词中指出，我们不能把科学同政治割裂开来，否则，我们就会犯严重的错误。我们只有同人民群众一起进行斗争，获得民族独立，才有可能使我们国家的科学和真正的民族文化得到发展。他说，一切依靠帝国主义“援助”所取得的科学发展都是虚假的，而且注定是要失败的。
    他说，我们不要犯那种把科学看成是善心的仙女的错误，对于帝国主义是如何利用科学家的，我们领教得够多了。全世界一切正直的科学家都必须毫无例外地懂得：我们只能致力于以谋求人民的解放。我们清楚地知道，当科学发展出现在资本主义国家中时，它总是被用来压迫无产阶级和维护殖民统治。
    阿尔及利亚科学家优素福在致词中强调这次讨论会的重要性。他说，这是在中华人民共和国取得了伟大的科学技术成就之后举行的。参加这次讨论会使我们有机会了解成为这些胜利的基础的在科学和技术方面所作出的努力，并衡量中国人民所实现的大跃进，这对我们四大洲的人民来说是一种鼓舞，也是一个榜样。
    他说，通过这次讨论会我们可以就共同的方面交流彼此的经验，同与会的各国科学家交换意见，并为我们研究人员之间的卓有成效的合作打下基础。
    他指出，阿尔及利亚没有忘记帝国主义的威胁仍旧笼罩着我们四大洲。阿尔及利亚向那些仍处于帝国主义统治下的亚非人民所表现出的英雄气概致敬，尤其向为解放而战的英勇的越南人民致敬。
    他还希望讨论会结束的时候，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲各国之间的友好联系和科学方面的合作关系将得到进一步加强。
    东非科学院代表盖希在致词时代表东非科学院向讨论会表示最良好的祝愿。他说，亚非国家的科学技术长期落后，但是今天这些国家已经觉醒，并且正在向前迈进。这次在北京举行的国际科学讨论会，将有助于这些前进中的国家相互了解和科学事业的发展。
    阿富汗科学家埃巴迪在致词中说，中国，这个大国，在亚洲的伟大人物毛泽东主席的指引和领导下所取得的重大进步给我们以深刻的印象。我们由衷地向中国和中国人民表示庆贺。我们通过无线电广播，通过收到由中国寄来的报纸和杂志，知道了中国的进步，伟大的中国人民和中国的伟大人物。今天我们有机会亲眼看见这个进步，感到无比高兴。
