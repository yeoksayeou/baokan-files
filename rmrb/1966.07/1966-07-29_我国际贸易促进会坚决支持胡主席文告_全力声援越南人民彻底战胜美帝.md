	The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade today sent a telegram to the Vietnam Democratic Republic's Council for the Promotion of Trade, stating that Chinese economic and trade workers, together with the entire nation, are determined to be a strong rear guard for the Vietnamese people. They are ready to take any actions deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam, prepared to make the greatest sacrifices, and fully support the Vietnamese people in thoroughly defeating U.S. imperialism.

	In the telegram, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, on behalf of Chinese economic and trade workers, expresses the most resolute support for Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" and the most resolute endorsement of Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement and Marshal Zhu De's telegram to Chairman Long Chen.

	The telegram points out that any desperate struggles by U.S. imperialism will only end in final defeat in the face of the heroic Vietnamese people who dare to struggle and dare to win.
