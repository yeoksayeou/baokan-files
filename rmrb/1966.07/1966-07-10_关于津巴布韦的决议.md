	Resolution on Zimbabwe

	1. In view of the fact that:
		1. The British imperialists and colonialists continue to occupy Zimbabwe, which is an act of continued exploitation and aggression against the people of Zimbabwe;
		2. Britain, in collusion with other imperialist and colonialist countries, particularly the United States, is directing the settlers in Rhodesia to carry out various forms of colonial and imperialist exploitation against the people of Zimbabwe, including the so-called unilateral declaration of independence;

	2. And firmly believing that:
		The only correct way to liberate Zimbabwe, based on the revolutionary development of Zimbabwe's history, lies in the masses, in continuously arming them with revolutionary ideas, and in their taking up arms to use the revolutionary power of the masses to oppose imperialism, colonialism, and the counter-revolutionary forces of their agents;

	3. This conference:
		1. Fully supports the revolutionary people of Zimbabwe in their struggle to eliminate all forms of colonialism and imperialism; and calls on all revolutionary writers' movements around the world to continue tirelessly to expose British colonial and imperialist exploitation of Zimbabwe and to provide all necessary support to the people of Zimbabwe;
		2. Calls on all revolutionary governments and peoples around the world to fully support the just struggle of the people of Zimbabwe to overthrow colonial and imperialist rule in Zimbabwe;
		3. Calls on the people of Zimbabwe to constantly heighten their revolutionary vigilance, unite as one, and carry forward the revolutionary armed struggle led by the Zimbabwe African National Union, representing the masses, to liberate Zimbabwe;
		4. Fully endorses the program of the Zimbabwe African National Union for liberation.

    关于津巴布韦的决议一、鉴于
    1．英帝国主义者和殖民主义者继续占领津巴布韦是对津巴布韦人民继续进行剥削和侵略的行为；
    2．英国勾结其它帝国主义和殖民主义国家，特别是美国，正指使在罗得西亚的移民对津巴布韦人民群众进行包括所谓单方面宣布独立在内的、各式各样的殖民地剥削和帝国主义剥削；二、并深信
    根据津巴布韦历史上革命发展的情况，能够使津巴布韦获得解放的唯一正确的办法在于群众，在于不断以革命思想武装他们，在于他们拿起武器，以群众的革命力量反对帝国主义、殖民主义及其代理人的反革命力量；三、这次会议
    1．完全支持津巴布韦革命人民为消灭一切形式的殖民主义与帝国主义而进行的斗争；并号召全世界所有的革命作家运动继续不倦地致力于揭露英国对津巴布韦的殖民地剥削和帝国主义剥削，并给予津巴布韦人民一切必要的支持；
    2．号召全世界所有革命的政府和人民全力支持津巴布韦人民为推翻殖民主义和帝国主义在津巴布韦的统治而进行的正义斗争；
