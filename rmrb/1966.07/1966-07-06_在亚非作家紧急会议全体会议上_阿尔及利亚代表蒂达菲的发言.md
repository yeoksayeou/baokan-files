At the full session of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, Algerian representative Nureddine Tidafi said today that the peoples of Asia and Africa have been united in blood in their struggle against imperialism. The Vietnamese people have waged a heroic struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The myth of American strength has been shattered in the face of the 14 million people of South Vietnam. He expressed that the Algerian people fully support the struggle of the Vietnamese people. He condemned U.S. imperialism for establishing more than 2,000 military bases worldwide and for carrying out savage aggression and suppression of national liberation movements in many places in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

He said, Washington wants to turn South Vietnam into its colony at any cost, which makes us all stand up with the fighters of South Vietnam.

He said, the blood of the Vietnamese people and their brave struggle have made it impossible for the American imperialists to rule as they please as in the past.

He pointed out that Chairman Mao Zedong's thought that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" has been proven once again in the armed struggles in Vietnam and other places. North and South Vietnam will inevitably be united.

He said, one should not compromise with imperialism but fight against it; not only fight it but defeat it. One should not be afraid of imperialist provocations; the more it provokes us, the sooner we will achieve liberation.

When talking about the tasks of Asian and African writers, he said, there is no such thing as non-political culture, and writers should be revolutionaries.

He pointed out that a mass and combative literature should be established, and writers should use their pens to fight, uniting the people in armed revolution.

    在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上
    阿尔及利亚代表蒂达菲的发言
    新华社五日讯　阿尔及利亚代表努雷丁·蒂达菲今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，亚洲和非洲的人民在反帝斗争中用鲜血团结在一起。越南人民进行了英勇的抗美救国斗争。美国佬的强大的神话在一千四百万越南南方人民的面前破产了。他表示阿尔及利亚人民全力支持越南人民的斗争。他谴责美帝国主义在全世界建立了两千多个军事基地，在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲许多地方疯狂地进行侵略，镇压各国的民族解放运动。
    他说，华盛顿想要不惜一切代价地把南越变成它的殖民地，这使我们大家和越南南方的战士一样站了起来。
    他说，越南人民的鲜血，勇敢的斗争，已经使美帝国主义者不能再象过去那样为所欲为地进行统治了。
    他指出，毛泽东主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的思想，在越南和其它地方的武装斗争中再一次得到了证明。越南的北方和南方必将统一起来。
    他说，人们不应该同帝国主义妥协，而是要同它斗争；不仅打它，而且要打垮它。不要害怕帝国主义的挑衅，它愈是向我们挑衅，我们就会更早地得到解放。
    谈到亚非作家的任务时，他说，非政治性的文化是没有的，作家就应是革命者。
    他指出，应该建立群众性的战斗文学，作家们应该用笔杆去进行战斗，应该把人民团结在武装革命中。
