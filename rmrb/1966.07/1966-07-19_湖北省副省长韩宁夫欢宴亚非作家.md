He also expressed firm support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and firm support for the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and colonialism.

	Secretary-General Manuvila of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers spoke at the banquet, saying that our conference has achieved the goal of supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression. Manuvila said that among us, there were some who claimed to love us but actually supported the enemy. We have now expelled them. Manuvila condemned those who claimed to be revolutionary, friends of the Vietnamese people, and friends of the Asian and African peoples, but actually stabbed the Asian and African peoples in the back. He said that such people are no longer with us. Manuvila said that writers from our two continents have come to China and seen the great achievements of the Chinese people. These achievements are the result of the Chinese people's efforts under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and they have greatly inspired our conference.

　　湖北省副省长韩宁夫欢宴亚非作家
    据新华社武汉十八日电　湖北省副省长韩宁夫举行宴会，热烈欢迎出席亚非作家紧急会议的外国朋友。
    韩宁夫在宴会上代表湖北省人民向外国朋友表示热烈的欢迎。他说，湖北省人民和全国人民一样，热烈欢呼这次会议所取得的巨大成就。他还表示坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，坚决支持世界人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争。
    亚非作家紧急会议秘书长曼努维拉在宴会上讲话时说，我们的会议达到了亚非作家对越南人民抗美斗争的支持的目的。曼努维拉说，我们当中曾有些人自称是热爱我们的人，实际上是支持敌人的，这次我们把他们清除出去了。曼努维拉谴责有些人自称是革命的，是越南人民的朋友，是亚非人民的朋友，实际上他们在背后刺了亚非人民一刀。他说，这种人现在已经不和我们在一起了。曼努维拉说，我们两大洲的作家来到中国，看到了中国人民获得的巨大成就。这种成就是中国人民在毛泽东思想指导下取得的，这种成就给我们的会议很大的鼓舞。
