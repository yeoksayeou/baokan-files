A wave of studying Chairman Mao's works is sweeping through the progressive youth and students in Japan. They deeply love Chairman Mao and support Mao Zedong Thought. They believe that Mao Zedong Thought is not only applicable to China but also to the entire world.

A first-year university student majoring in literature said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time." This is the evaluation of Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought by revolutionary young students in Japan.

A prominent university in Tokyo has a China Studies Association that focuses on studying the history of the Chinese revolution. It also requires members to study Chairman Mao's works such as "On New Democracy," "On Coalition Government," and "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." The association has established a Mao Zedong Philosophy Study Group for this year's new students, with the first half of the year dedicated to studying Chairman Mao's famous philosophical work "On Practice" and the second half to "On Contradiction." Students generally believe that studying Mao Zedong's works is not only necessary for understanding modern and contemporary Chinese history but also the best way to understand New China and the Chinese revolution.

Japanese progressive youth and students are using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to observe their own nation's destiny and the world.

A third-year student majoring in commerce at a certain university has read through the first to the fourth volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." When talking about his experience of studying Mao Zedong's works, he enthusiastically praised their profound significance. He said, "Every article by Mao Zedong not only permeates the thorough revolutionary and people-serving spirit but also thoroughly permeates the Marxist dialectical and historical materialist worldview." This university student also said that after reading Chairman Mao's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," he was deeply inspired. Chairman Mao used the Marxist class analysis and class struggle perspective to analyze a complex Chinese society clearly, pointing out the direction of the Chinese revolution's class struggle—relying on which class, uniting with which class, and opposing which class—and indicating the path the Chinese revolution should take.

A female literature student said, "I read Chairman Mao's 'On Practice,' 'On Contradiction,' 'Rectify the Party's Style of Work,' 'Oppose Party Sectarianism,' and other works and found them easy to understand. Moreover, what you learn can be applied immediately and effectively." She said that she often encounters difficulties in her extracurricular activities, but whenever she faces difficulties, she uses the philosophical views from 'On Practice' and 'On Contradiction' to analyze these difficulties and overcomes them one by one.

A second-year student majoring in politics and economics said, "The contradiction between imperialism and the peoples of colonial countries remains a major contradiction in the contemporary world. To resolve this contradiction, Mao Zedong Thought is applicable not only to China but also to the entire world." This young person uses Mao Zedong Thought to refute the erroneous argument that oppressed peoples should "coexist peacefully" with imperialism after the advent of nuclear weapons. He said, "Oppressors and the oppressed cannot coexist peacefully. Imperialists will always suppress the peoples of colonial countries, and the idea of maintaining the old order is fundamentally wrong."

    日本广大进步青年学生掀起学习毛主席著作的热潮
　　毛泽东思想是当代马列主义的顶峰  毛泽东是当代最伟大的马列主义者
    新华社东京十一日电　在日本广大进步青年学生中正在形成一个学习毛主席著作的热潮，他们衷心热爱毛主席，拥护毛泽东思想。他们认为，毛泽东思想不仅适用于中国，而且也适用于全世界。
    一位学文学的大学一年级学生说，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，毛泽东是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。这就是日本革命的青年学生对毛泽东主席和毛泽东思想的评价。
    东京一所著名大学的中国问题研究会，把研究中国革命史作为主要课题，同时还指定参加研究会的会员必须学习毛泽东主席的《新民主主义论》、《论联合政府》和《论人民民主专政》等文章。这所大学的中国问题研究会，还专门为今年新入学的学生成立了毛泽东哲学学习小组，规定上半年学习毛主席的著名哲学著作《实践论》，下半年学习《矛盾论》。学生们普遍认为，学习毛泽东著作，不仅是学习中国近代史和现代史所必要的，而且也是了解新中国、了解中国革命的一条最好的途径。
    日本进步青年学生，正在用毛泽东思想作为武器，观察自己民族的命运和观察世界。
    一位在某大学学习商科的三年级学生已经读完了《毛泽东选集》第一卷到第四卷。他在谈到学习毛泽东著作的体会时，热情地称赞了毛泽东著作的深刻意义。他说，毛泽东著作的每一篇文章，不仅贯彻了彻底为革命和为人民服务的思想，而且彻底贯彻了马克思主义的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观。这位大学生还说，当他读完了毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》和《中国革命和中国共产党》等著作之后，深受启发。毛泽东主席用马克思主义的阶级分析和阶级斗争观点把一个复杂的中国社会分析得清清楚楚，指出了中国革命应当依靠什么阶级、联合什么阶级和反对什么阶级的革命斗争方向，指出了中国革命应当走的道路。
    一位学习文学的女大学生说，我读了毛泽东主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《改造我们的学习》、《整顿党的作风》、《反对党八股》等著作，觉得很容易懂，而且学了就能够用，用了就立刻有效。她说，她在搞课余活动时经常遇到困难，但是每当遇到困难时，她就用《实践论》、《矛盾论》的哲学观点去分析这些困难，并且一个一个地克服了这些困难。
    一位在大学学政治和经济的二年级学生说，帝国主义和殖民地人民之间的矛盾仍然是当前世界上的一个主要矛盾，为了解决这个矛盾，毛泽东思想不仅适用于中国，而且也适用于全世界。这位青年运用毛泽东思想驳斥了那种认为核武器出现以后被压迫的人民只有同帝国主义“和平共处”的错误论调。他说，压迫者和被压迫者是不能和平共处的。帝国主义者总是要镇压殖民地人民的，那种企图维持旧秩序的想法是根本错误的。
