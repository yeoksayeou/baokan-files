The Albanian newspaper published on July 15th the draft directive for the fourth five-year plan (1966-1970) for the economic and cultural development of the People's Republic of Albania, which was adopted by the 17th plenary session of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour and will be submitted to the Fifth Party Congress for discussion.

The draft directive points out that under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour, the Albanian people have adhered to the principle of self-reliance, relying on the selfless labor of the people and the material and financial resources of the state, achieving tremendous successes in the third five-year plan.

The draft directive points out that imperialists led by U.S. imperialism, the traitors of Marxism-Leninism, the Khrushchev revisionists, and the Tito clique have spared no effort to sabotage the socialist construction of the People's Republic of Albania and prevent the realization of the third five-year plan. However, these attempts, like in the past, have met with miserable failure.

The draft directive emphasizes that to smash the enemy's plots, a broad revolutionary movement has been launched in Albania, igniting boundless enthusiasm and endless creativity, mobilizing and fully utilizing all the possibilities and advantages of the socialist economy to overcome the obstacles and difficulties caused by the revisionist-imperialist blockade.

The draft directive points out that in the face of such difficult circumstances, the extremely generous multi-faceted, fraternal, and thorough internationalist aid provided by the People's Republic of China has played an important role in helping the Albanian people overcome these obstacles and difficulties and successfully complete the main tasks of the third five-year plan.

The draft directive further points out that considering that the third five-year plan was realized under extremely difficult conditions and the results achieved, the Central Committee of the Party of Labour believes that the tasks proposed by the Fourth Congress of the Party of Labour have been generally and gloriously completed, and the main objectives set for this period have been achieved.

When discussing the main tasks of the fourth five-year plan (1966-1970) for economic and cultural development, the draft directive points out that the Albanian people have greater strength and richer experience in the construction and defense of socialism, and they have firm determination and unparalleled revolutionary enthusiasm, as well as unshakable confidence in their own strength, to accept and complete even greater new tasks in the future.

The draft directive points out that the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour has set the following main tasks for the development of the people's economy and culture during the fourth five-year plan period (1966-1970):

Ensure the further development of the country's productive forces to accelerate the nationwide construction of the material and technological foundations of socialism. The means to achieve this goal are: to continue the socialist industrialization of the country, to increase industrial production by opening up and constructing new projects and utilizing production capacity more rationally, and to concentrate efforts on developing agricultural production, especially grain production. For this, the first step is to achieve high agricultural yields. On the basis of the growth of social products, improve the material and cultural living standards of the people and enhance the defensive power of the motherland.

At the same time, on the correct revolutionary path, make the socialist production relations more perfect, gradually narrow the gaps between urban and rural areas, between the working class and peasants, between industry and agriculture, and between mental and manual labor, deepen the socialist revolution in the fields of ideology and culture, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, strengthen the unity of the people and the party, and wage fierce and irreconcilable class struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, so as to continuously advance the socialist revolution in all aspects.

The draft directive points out that the main indicators for the development of the economy and culture during the fourth five-year plan period are as follows:

1. The total industrial output in 1970 will increase by 45 to 50 percent compared to 1965.
2. The total agricultural output during the fourth five-year plan period will increase by 35 to 40 percent compared to the third five-year plan period.
3. The national income in 1970 will increase by 43 to 48 percent compared to 1965.
4. The total investment during the fourth five-year plan period will increase by 28 to 33 percent compared to the third five-year plan period.
5. The total volume of commodity circulation in 1970 will increase by 25 to 27 percent compared to 1965.
6. The real income of the people in 1970 will increase by 15 to 17 percent compared to 1965.

The draft directive points out that during the fourth five-year plan period, the development of industry will be carried out according to the country's policy of further socialist industrialization, prioritizing the production of means of production, especially the mining, refining, and processing of mineral products, oil, and gas, expanding the power base, developing metallurgy, machinery manufacturing, and the chemical industry. These are important links to enhance the country's economic strength and develop other sectors of the national economy.

The purpose of increasing industrial production is to better meet the needs of the people, socialist construction, and national defense, and to further improve the situation of foreign trade.

The draft directive points out that the great task facing Albanian agriculture is to increasingly better meet the needs of the state, first of all to increase the supply of wheat for making bread, to continuously increase the supply of agricultural and livestock products in the market, the supply of industrial raw materials, to increase and expand exports, and to improve the economic situation of the peasants.

The draft directive points out that during the fourth five-year plan period, cultural and artistic undertakings will be developed and raised to a higher level to educate the working masses with revolutionary spirit and communist moral qualities. Special attention will be paid to the development and improvement of cultural and artistic work in rural areas.

The draft directive finally points out: The fourth five-year plan is an important step forward in the fundamental task of completing the construction of a comprehensive socialist society. The fourth five-year plan opens up more magnificent new prospects for the development of the country's economy and culture, for the defense and strengthening of our socialist motherland.
