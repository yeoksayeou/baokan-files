Title: Resolution on Malaysia

Edition: 7

The conference pays tribute to the Malaysian National Liberation Army. Since June 20, 1948, it has been steadfast in its struggle against British imperialism, which is supported by the United States. It is making a contribution to the common cause of the peoples of Asia and Africa in their struggle against imperialism led by the United States, and especially to the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression.

The conference condemns the puppet regimes of Abdul Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew, and expresses solidarity and support for anti-imperialist writers and other cultural workers in Malaysia. These writers and cultural workers, through their work in the Malaysian National Liberation Army and in other areas of the people's liberation struggle, have been contributing to the development of the movement to smash the neo-colonialist "Malaysia" and to achieve a truly independent Malaysia that includes Singapore as an indivisible part.

The conference strongly condemns the so-called "new villages" established by British imperialism and its puppets in various parts of Malaysia. These are new-style concentration camps set up under various notorious fascist laws, regulations, and decrees, where patriots, including writers and other cultural workers, are subjected to brutal mass arrests, detention without trial, and other forms of fascist persecution.

We call upon all anti-imperialist writers in Asia and Africa:

To expose the British neo-colonialist product "Malaysia" and the fake "independent" state of Singapore, which are actually part of the neo-colonialist plot to perpetuate colonial rule, in line with the American strategy of aggression in Southeast Asia and the Far East, to serve their policy of aggression "east of Suez";

To demand the immediate and complete withdrawal of British, Australian, New Zealand, and other foreign troops from Malaysian territory, and the immediate dismantling of their military bases in Malaysia;

To demand the immediate and unconditional release of all Malaysian patriots, including writers and other cultural workers;

To allow those who have been forced to leave the country or have been expelled to return unconditionally; and

To propagate the struggle of the Malaysian people for national liberation.

The conference is also closely monitoring the new anti-people, anti-democratic, and anti-Chinese activities of American and British imperialists in the region following the U.S.-orchestrated military coup in Indonesia in September 1965. One of these activities is the meeting in Bangkok between the puppet organization of "Malaysia," Abdul Razak, and the fascist regime of Adam Malik in Indonesia. They discussed how the Indonesian fascists and the British puppets in "Malaysia" and Singapore can further collaborate to suppress the anti-imperialist movements in Malaysia, North Borneo, and Indonesia, and to serve the U.S.-British policy of containing the People's Republic of China.

On this occasion, we protest against the unjustified continued detention of four members of the Malaysian National Liberation Front delegation in Jakarta by the fascist regime of Nasution-Suharto in Indonesia. We demand their immediate and unconditional release and guarantee of their personal safety.

### 关于马来亚的决议

    关于马来亚的决议
    会议向马来亚民族解放军致敬。它自从一九四八年六月二十日以来，坚持同得到美国支持的英帝国主义作战，正在对亚非人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的共同事业，特别是对越南人民反对美国侵略的英勇斗争作出贡献。
    会议谴责阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼及李光耀傀儡政权，并向马来亚反帝的作家和其他文化工作者表示声援和支持。这些作家和文化工作者通过在马来亚民族解放军和在人民解放事业的其他领域中的工作，对粉碎新殖民主义的“马来西亚”运动的发展，对实现一个以新加坡为其不可分割部分的真正独立的马来亚，一直在作出贡献。
    会议强烈谴责仍在马来亚各地进行的由英帝国主义及其傀儡根据各种臭名昭彰的法西斯法律、条例及法令而设立的所谓“新村”的新式集中营，对包括作家和其他文化工作者在内的爱国者进行横暴的大逮捕、不加审讯的拘禁和其他方式的法西斯迫害。
    我们号召所有亚非反帝作家：
    揭露英国新殖民主义的产物“马来西亚”和新加坡这个假的“独立”国家，它们实际上是新殖民主义者的阴谋的一部分，这个阴谋的目的在于永远保持他们的殖民统治，配合美国侵略东南亚和远东的战略计划，为他们的“苏伊士以东”的侵略政策效劳；
    要求英国、澳大利亚、新西兰和其它外国军队立即全部撤出马来亚领土，并立即全部撤除他们在马来亚的军事基地；
    要求立即无条件释放所有马来亚爱国人士，包括作家及其它文化工作者在内；
    要求允许被迫离国或被驱逐的人们无条件地返回祖国；并
    宣传马来亚人民争取民族解放的斗争。
    会议同时密切注视着继一九六五年九月美国策划的军事政变血洗印度尼西亚之后，美英帝国主义者在这个地区进行的反人民、反民主和反华的新阴谋活动。这些新活动之一就是“马来西亚”傀儡组织的阿卜杜勒·拉扎克和印度尼西亚法西斯政权的阿达姆·马利克在曼谷举行会谈，讨论印度尼西亚法西斯分子同英国在“马来西亚”和新加坡的傀儡如何进一步勾结来扑灭马来亚、北加里曼丹和印度尼西亚的反帝运动，并为美英“遏制”中华人民共和国的政策服务。
    我们借这个机会抗议印度尼西亚的纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯政权毫无理由地继续拘禁马来亚民族解放同盟驻雅加达代表团的四个团员，要求立即无条件地释放他们，并且保证他们的人身安全。
