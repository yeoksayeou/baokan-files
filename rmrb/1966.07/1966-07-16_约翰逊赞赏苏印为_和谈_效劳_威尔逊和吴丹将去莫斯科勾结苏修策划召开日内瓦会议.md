	Johnson Praises Soviet-Indian Efforts for "Peace Talks"
	Wilson and Thant to Visit Moscow to Conspire with Soviet Revisionists to Plan Geneva Conference

	Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: Washington reports that on the 14th, U.S. President Johnson once again expressed his "welcome" to the reactionary Indian government's collaboration with the Soviet revisionist leadership in serving the U.S. plot of "bombing for peace."

	Johnson and the current Australian Prime Minister Holt, who is active in the U.S., issued a joint statement on the 14th.

	The statement on one hand declared that the U.S. is "determined" to continue its aggression in Vietnam; on the other hand, it expressed "welcome" to the Indian Prime Minister's call for the Soviet government to reconvene a meeting of the Geneva Conference countries.

	Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is currently in Moscow discussing the planning of the Geneva Conference with Soviet leaders. Before her departure on the 7th, she proposed an initiative for the two co-chairs of the Geneva Conference (the UK and the Soviet Union) to immediately convene the Geneva Conference to "peacefully resolve" the Vietnam issue. The next day, the U.S. State Department issued a statement expressing its "welcome" to Gandhi's proposal to convene the (Geneva) conference.

	It was announced that after Gandhi's visit, British Prime Minister Wilson and UN Secretary-General Thant will also visit the Soviet Union in succession. Wilson and Thant have long been faithful agents of the U.S. "peace talks" deception. The British government, while announcing Wilson's visit to the Soviet Union, has already clearly stated that Wilson's visit is part of the conspiracy to convene the Geneva Conference. According to the Associated Press, Thant will also "discuss proposals for resolving the Vietnam issue" with Soviet leaders.

	The Associated Press reported from Moscow on the 11th: Moscow has now become "a stage for a series of new actions leading to peace in Vietnam."

　　约翰逊赞赏苏印为“和谈”效劳
　　威尔逊和吴丹将去莫斯科勾结苏修策划召开日内瓦会议
    新华社十五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊十四日再次表示“欢迎”印度反动派伙同苏联修正主义领导集团为美国的“以炸迫和”的阴谋效劳。
    约翰逊同目前正在美国活动的澳大利亚总理霍尔特十四日发表了一个会谈公报。
    公报一方面扬言美国“决心”坚持进行侵略越南的战争；一方面表示，“欢迎印度总理呼吁苏联政府重新召集日内瓦会议国家开会的倡议”。
    印度总理英迪拉·甘地夫人目前正在莫斯科同苏联领导人就策划召开日内瓦会议问题举行会谈。她在七日动身出国前夕抛出了一个为美国效劳的所谓由日内瓦会议两主席（英苏）立即召开日内瓦会议“和平解决”越南问题的“倡议”。第二天，美国国务院就发表声明，表示“欢迎甘地总理关于召开（日内瓦）会议的主张”。
    据宣布，在甘地夫人结束她的“访问”后，英国首相威尔逊和联合国秘书长吴丹也将相继去苏联。威尔逊和吴丹一直是美国“和谈”骗局的忠实掮客。英国官方在宣布威尔逊访苏消息的同时已经明白表示，威尔逊此行是策划召开日内瓦会议的阴谋活动中的一个组成部分。据美联社报道，吴丹也将同苏联领导人“讨论关于安排越南问题的主张”。
    美联社在十一日从莫斯科发出的一条消息说：莫斯科现在已经成了“一系列要导致越南和平的新行动的舞台。”
