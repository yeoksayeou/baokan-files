Chinese people's organizations and democratic parties have issued statements.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today issued a statement saying that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement on July 22 fully expresses the resolute and enthusiastic support of the 700 million Chinese people for Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" issued on July 17. Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement has boosted the morale of the Chinese people and the revolutionary spirit of the people of the world. Chinese workers resolutely support Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement and are implementing it with concrete actions.

The statement said, the U.S. imperialists are the sworn enemies of the Vietnamese people and the most vicious enemies of the working class and people of the world. The U.S. imperialists have suffered defeats in the Vietnam War and are trying to use the tactic of "escalating" the war and expanding bombing to force a "negotiated settlement." This is a complete deception and a big plot. The statement said, Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out that the U.S. must stop its aggression against Vietnam and withdraw all its troops and those of its accomplices from Vietnam, and then peace will be immediately restored. This is a strong rebuff to the U.S. imperialists' "bombing to force negotiations" plot and a blow to those who conspire with the U.S. imperialists to create a "negotiated settlement" deception.

The statement said, the world can clearly see that this time the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is a result of collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. This once again exposes the true face of the Soviet modern revisionist leadership as the chief accomplice of the U.S. imperialists.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' statement said, the great struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression and for national salvation has supported the Chinese people. It is the internationalist duty of Chinese workers and people to fully support the Vietnamese people. We are determined and prepared for any eventuality. No matter how the U.S. imperialists escalate the war or what sacrifices we have to make, the Chinese working class and people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will firmly support our Vietnamese brothers until final victory.

The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation today issued a joint statement expressing the resolve of 130 million Chinese youth and students to make the greatest sacrifices and fully support the Vietnamese people in completely, thoroughly, and utterly annihilating the U.S. aggressors.

The statement expressed enthusiastic support for Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement and resolute support for Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots."

The statement said, the Vietnamese people and youth are determined to persist in a long-term struggle, which is a powerful response to the U.S. imperialists' attempt to "escalate" the war and a blow to the U.S. imperialists' and their accomplices' "negotiated settlement" deception. In the people's war in Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists can only find their own graves.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership has completely degenerated into the chief accomplice of the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam and is a shameful traitor to the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary interests of the people of the world. To oppose the U.S. imperialists, the revolutionary people and youth of the world must also oppose the Soviet modern revisionists, who are the chief accomplices of the U.S. imperialists.

The statement said, the heroic Vietnamese people and youth are our close comrades-in-arms. The 700 million Chinese people are the most reliable rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and our vast territory is the most reliable and powerful rear base for the Vietnamese people. We are filled with hatred, and we firmly grasp our guns, ready to take any necessary actions together with our Vietnamese brothers and sisters to jointly strike the U.S. aggressors. We will not rest until we have completely, thoroughly, and utterly annihilated the U.S. aggressors!

The All-China Women's Federation today issued a statement saying that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's solemn declaration on July 22 fully expresses the firm will and resolve of the Chinese people and women. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms in his "Letter to All Compatriots" is a powerful response to the U.S. imperialists' war "escalation" and "bombing to force negotiations" plot, expressing the Vietnamese people's iron will and firm stance to carry the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end. Chinese women express their utmost admiration and resolute support.

The statement said, under Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms, unity, and victory, 31 million Vietnamese people are being widely mobilized and closely united to deal a heavier blow to the U.S. imperialists. No matter what plots the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys concoct, they cannot escape their doom. The plot of the Soviet modern revisionist leadership, the chief accomplice of the U.S. imperialists, to betray the Vietnamese people will also meet with complete failure and bankruptcy.

The statement said, the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are invincible. We have confronted the U.S. imperialists before. As Chairman Liu Shaoqi said, "To support the Vietnamese people in achieving complete victory in the anti-U.S. war, the Chinese people are prepared to make the greatest national sacrifices." No matter how the U.S. imperialists escalate the war, our stance of supporting Vietnam and opposing the U.S. will never change. Chinese women will stand with the Vietnamese people and the people of the world to jointly strike the U.S. aggressors until we have completely and utterly driven the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam. We will not rest until we achieve this goal.

The Chinese People's Association for Peace and Friendship with Foreign Countries and the Chinese People's Association for Afro-Asian Solidarity today jointly issued a statement saying that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement fully expresses the firm will of the 700 million Chinese people to support Vietnam and oppose the U.S. and the resolute determination of all the Chinese people. The statement said, the Chinese people have always kept their word. No matter how the U.S. imperialists fight or for how long, the Chinese people will unreservedly fully support our Vietnamese brothers and stand together with the Vietnamese people to achieve final victory.

The Chinese People's Association for Peace and Friendship with Foreign Countries and the Chinese People's Association for Afro-Asian Solidarity also expressed their most resolute and enthusiastic support for Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms and resolute support for the Vietnamese people's ongoing and already victorious struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The statement said, Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms is a powerful response to the U.S. aggressors' war "escalation" crimes and "bombing to force negotiations" plot, and a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionist leadership and the Indian reactionaries who are running errands for the U.S. "negotiated settlement" deception.

The statement said, Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call to arms has boosted the morale of all oppressed nations and peoples and struck down the arrogance of the U.S. imperialists and their followers. It has won the high praise and respect of the Chinese people and all revolutionary people of the world. Final victory will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people, and the U.S. imperialists and all their accomplices and lackeys will not escape the judgment of the revolutionary people.

The Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association today issued a statement saying that we are prepared to support our Vietnamese brothers in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation at any time with concrete actions. We will stand with the people of the nation to be the rear guard of the Vietnamese people and fight to the end with the common enemy of the people of the world, the U.S. imperialists, until we completely defeat them. We will not rest until we achieve this goal.

The statement expressed resolute support for Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement and Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots."

The statement strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for ignoring the opposition and warnings of the people of the world and brazenly bombing Hanoi and Haiphong in an attempt to intimidate the Vietnamese people into surrendering and forcing a "peace negotiation." The statement said, the U.S. aggressors have been severely beaten by the heroic Vietnamese people and are now in a desperate situation. The U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong does not show their "strength" but further exposes their paper tiger nature. The heroic Vietnamese people are not intimidated and cannot be deceived. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's solemn declaration has completely shattered the U.S. imperialists' dream of "bombing to force negotiations" and has also given a powerful rebuke to all those who are running errands for the U.S. imperialists. Final victory will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people who dare to struggle, are not afraid of threats, and are not deceived.

The statement said, in the U.S. government's evil activities of "bombing to force negotiations," the Soviet revisionist leadership has played the most shameful role, acting as the chief accomplice of the U.S. imperialists. This is obvious to all and cannot be denied.

The statement said, we are determined, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, to learn from the Vietnamese people's revolutionary spirit of not fearing difficulties and not fearing sacrifices, and stand with the people of the nation to be the rear guard of the Vietnamese people and fight to the end with the common enemy of the people of the world, the U.S. imperialists, until we completely defeat them. We will not rest until we achieve this goal.

The China Democratic League today issued a statement saying that the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam is aggression against China. The China Democratic League will unite more closely around the Communist Party of China, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and stand with the people of the nation to fully support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation until we completely defeat the U.S. aggressors and achieve final victory.

The statement said, the China Democratic League resolutely supports Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement on July 22 and Chairman Zhu De's telegram to Chairman Truong of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and resolutely supports Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" on July 17 and his order to mobilize part of the reserve forces. The statement said, these documents of great historical significance fully express the common struggle of the people of China and Vietnam to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and their determination and confidence.

The statement strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for gradually "escalating" and expanding their aggression in the Vietnam War while also promoting a "negotiated settlement" deception. The statement pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' attempt to intimidate the Vietnamese people into stopping their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation with "bombing to force negotiations" will never succeed. The statement pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership is trying to make a dirty deal with the U.S. imperialists on the Vietnam issue, betraying the Vietnamese people, and realizing a new Munich plot between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The statement expressed resolute opposition and strong condemnation of the Soviet revisionist leadership's evil actions.

The Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association today issued a statement saying that all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, will stand with the people of the nation, fearing no difficulties, fearing no sacrifices, and willing to pay any price, to resolutely support our Vietnamese brothers in their just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation and fight to the end to completely defeat the U.S. aggressors.

The statement expressed enthusiastic support for Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement and Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots."

The statement strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for brazenly bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, escalating the war to a new and more serious stage. The statement said, history will not develop according to the imperialists' subjective wishes. The U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes have once again exposed them as the most vicious enemies of the people of the world. The heroic Vietnamese people are indomitable. No matter how many troops the U.S. imperialists increase in their aggression against South Vietnam, reaching 300,000, 500,000, or even more, and no matter how savagely they bomb North Vietnam, they cannot intimidate the Vietnamese people. "Negotiated settlement" cannot deceive the Vietnamese people. Now, all 31 million Vietnamese people are responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms, more closely united, firmly grasping their guns, fearing no sacrifices, and resolutely fighting. In any situation, they are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors until there is not a single trace of U.S. aggressors on Vietnamese soil.

The statement pointed out that in the U.S. imperialists' big plot of "bombing to force negotiations," the Soviet revisionist leadership has played the role of the chief accomplice. The statement said, the Soviet revisionist leadership's despicable actions are being increasingly exposed by the revolutionary people of the world. No matter how much they run errands for the U.S. imperialists, they cannot save the U.S. aggressors from their inevitable failure.

The statement said, the fighting friendship and strong unity between the people of China and Vietnam are the most reliable guarantee for defeating the U.S. imperialists. The U.S. imperialists' war threats cannot intimidate the Vietnamese people, nor can they intimidate the Chinese people; their sweet talk cannot deceive the Vietnamese people, nor can it deceive the Chinese people.

    全力支援越南人民抗美救国斗争直到彻底胜利
    不管美帝国主义和他的走狗搞什么阴谋，都逃不脱灭亡的命运。美帝国主义的头号帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团出卖越南人民的阴谋，必将遭到彻底破产和失败
    全国总工会
    新华社二十三日讯　中华全国总工会今天发表声明说，刘少奇主席二十二日的声明表达了七亿中国人民最坚决地、最热烈地支持越南民主共和国主席胡志明七月十七日发表的《告全国同胞书》的钢铁意志。刘少奇主席的声明长了中国人民的志气，长了全世界革命人民的威风。中国工人最坚决地拥护刘少奇主席的声明，并且正在以实际行动坚决拥护和贯彻这个声明。
    声明说，美帝国主义是越南人民不共戴天的敌人，也是全世界工人阶级和人民最凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义在侵越战争中连吃败仗，妄图用战争“升级”扩大轰炸的办法，压出一个“和谈”来，这是一个彻头彻尾的大骗局、大阴谋。声明说，胡志明主席指出，美国必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须把美国军队和它的帮凶军全部撤出越南，这样和平就会立即恢复。这是对美帝国主义“以炸迫和”阴谋的一个迎头痛击，对那些同美帝国主义合谋制造“和谈”骗局的牛鬼蛇神，也是当头一棒。
    声明说，全世界都看得清清楚楚，这次美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防，完全是美苏串通一气搞出来的。这就再一次暴露了苏联现代修正主义领导集团是美帝国主义头号帮凶的面目。
    全国总工会的声明说，越南人民的伟大抗美救国斗争支持了中国人民，全力支援越南人民是中国工人和人民义不容辞的国际主义义务。我们下定了决心，做好了各种准备，不管美帝国主义把战争扩大到什么地方，不管要付出多大代价，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级和全国人民，将坚定不移地支持兄弟的越南人民，随时随地准备采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动，共同打击美国侵略者，直到彻底胜利。

    声明表示热烈拥护刘少奇主席的声明，坚决支持胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》。
    声明说，越南人民和青年、学生决心坚持长期抗战，这是对美帝国主义把侵略战争“升级”的强有力回击，也是对美帝国主义及其帮凶的“和谈”骗局的当头一棒。在越南的人民战争的火海中，美帝国主义所能找到的，只能是自己的坟墓。
    声明指出，苏联修正主义领导集团已经完完全全堕落成美帝国主义侵略越南的头号帮凶，是出卖越南人民和全世界人民革命利益的可耻叛徒。全世界的革命人民和青年要反对美帝国主义，就必须反对充当美帝国主义头号帮凶的苏联现代修正主义。
    声明说，英雄的越南人民和青年学生是我们亲密的战友。七亿中国人民是越南人民最可靠的后盾，我们辽阔的国土，是越南人民最得力最可靠的大后方。我们仇恨满胸膛，我们紧握手中枪，作好准备，随时随地采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动，和英雄的越南兄弟姐妹们一起，共同打击美国侵略者。不把美国侵略强盗彻底、干净、全部消灭，我们决不罢休！
    全国妇联
    新华社二十三日讯  中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天发表声明说，刘少奇主席七月二十二日声明中的庄严宣告完全表达了中国人民和中国妇女的坚强意志和决心。胡志明主席在《告全国同胞书》中气壮山河的战斗号召，是对美帝国主义的战争“升级”和“以炸迫和”阴谋的最强有力的回击，表达了越南人民坚决把抗美救国斗争进行到底的钢铁意志和坚定立场，中国妇女表示无限的钦佩和最坚决的支持。
    声明说，在胡志明主席战斗的、团结的、胜利的号召下，三千一百万越南人民正在广泛地动员起来，紧密地团结起来，给美帝国主义以更加沉重的打击。不管美帝国主义和他的走狗搞什么阴谋，都逃不脱灭亡的命运。美帝国主义的头号帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团出卖越南人民的阴谋，也必将遭到彻底破产和失败。
    声明说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是战无不胜的。我们是同美帝国主义较量过的。正如刘少奇主席说的：“为了支持越南人民夺取抗美战争的彻底胜利，中国人民准备承担最大的民族牺牲。”不管美帝国主义要把战争扩大到那里，我们援越抗美的立场永远不会改变。中国妇女一定要和越南人民一起，和全世界人民一起，共同打击美国侵略者，直到把美国侵略者全部彻底赶出越南，不达目的，决不罢休。
    和委会和亚非团结委员会
    新华社二十三日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国亚非团结委员会今天联合发表声明说，刘少奇主席的声明充分表达了七亿中国人民援越抗美的坚强意志，充分表达了全中国人民的坚定决心。声明说，中国人民从来说了话是算数的。不管美帝国主义怎么打，也不管它打到什么时候，中国人民将无保留地全力支援越南兄弟，同越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，取得最后的胜利。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国亚非团结委员会在声明中还表示最坚决、最热烈地支持越南民主共和国胡志明主席的战斗文告，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民正在进行的、已经取得重大胜利的抗美救国的正义斗争。声明说，胡志明主席的战斗文告是越南人民对美国侵略者战争“升级”罪行和“以炸迫和”阴谋的强有力的回答，也是对为美国“和谈”骗局奔走效劳的苏联修正主义领导集团和印度反动派的一记沉重的耳光。
    声明说，胡志明主席的伟大战斗号召，长了一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民的志气，灭了美帝国主义及其追随者的威风，得到了中国人民、全世界所有革命人民的高度赞扬和崇敬。最后胜利必将属于英雄的越南人民，美帝国主义以及它的一切帮凶和走狗也必将逃不掉革命人民的审判。
    民革中央委员会
    新华社二十三日讯　中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会今天发表声明说，我们准备随时以实际行动支援兄弟的越南人民的抗美救国斗争。我们和全国人民一道，誓为越南人民的后盾，与全世界人民的公敌美帝国主义斗争到底，不彻底打败美帝国主义，决不罢休。
    声明表示最坚决拥护刘少奇主席的声明和胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》。
    声明强烈谴责美帝国主义不顾全世界人民的反对和警告，悍然轰炸河内和海防，妄图胁迫越南人民屈服，逼出一个“和平谈判”。声明说，美国侵略者在英雄的越南人民的严重打击下，已经陷入走投无路的绝境。美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防，并不表明它的“强大”，而是进一步暴露了它外强中干的纸老虎的本质。英雄的越南人民是吓不倒的，也是骗不了的。胡志明主席这个庄严的宣告，彻底粉碎了美帝国主义“以炸迫和”的梦想，也给以所有为美帝国主义效劳的骗子手们一个有力的回击。最后胜利一定属于敢于斗争、不怕威胁、不受欺骗的英雄越南人民。
    声明说，在美国政府“以炸迫和”的罪恶活动中，苏联修正主义领导集团扮演了最无耻的角色，充当了美帝国主义的头号帮凶。这是有目共睹、尽人皆知的，是抵赖不了的。
    声明说，我们决心在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，学习越南人民不怕困难、不怕牺牲的革命精神，和全国人民一道，誓为越南人民的后盾，与全世界人民的公敌美帝国主义斗争到底，不彻底打败美帝国主义，决不罢休。
    民盟
    新华社二十三日讯　中国民主同盟今天发表声明说，美帝国主义对越南的侵略就是对中国的侵略。中国民主同盟一定更加紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗指引下，同全国人民一道，全力以赴地支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争，直到彻底打败美国侵略者，取得最后胜利。
    声明说，中国民主同盟坚决拥护刘少奇主席七月二十二日的声明和朱德委员长致越南民主共和国国会常务委员会长征主席的电报，坚决支持越南民主共和国胡志明主席七月十七日的《告全国同胞书》和关于动员一部分后备兵员的命令。声明说，这些有重大历史意义的文件，充分表达了中越两国人民共同斗争，反对美帝国主义侵略的决心和信心。
    声明严厉谴责美帝国主义在侵越战争中一面逐步
  “升级”，扩大侵略，一面又大搞“和谈”骗局。声明指出，美帝国主义妄想“以炸迫和”来吓唬越南人民停止抗美救国斗争，这是永远办不到的。声明指出，苏联修正主义领导集团妄想在越南问题上同美帝国主义做成肮脏的交易，出卖越南人民，实现美苏合伙的新的慕尼黑大阴谋。声明表示坚决反对并严厉谴责苏联修正主义领导集团的这一罪恶行动。
    民建中央委员会
    新华社二十三日讯　中国民主建国会中央委员会今天发表声明说，中国民主建国会的全体成员在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，同全国人民一道，不怕困难，不怕牺牲，不惜付出任何代价，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，为彻底打败美国侵略者而奋斗到底。
    声明表示最热烈地拥护刘少奇主席的声明和胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》。
    声明强烈谴责美帝国主义悍然轰炸河内、海防，把战争升到一个新的更严重的阶段。声明说，历史决不会按照帝国主义的主观愿望发展。美帝国主义的滔天罪行再一次暴露了它是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。英雄的越南人民是坚强不屈的。无论美帝国主义把侵略越南南方的军队增加到三十万、五十万，甚至更多，对越南北方野蛮地狂轰滥炸，都吓不倒越南人民，“和谈”也骗不了越南人民。现在，全越南三千一百万人民响应胡志明主席的战斗号召，更加团结一致，紧握手中枪，不怕牺牲，坚决战斗，在任何情况下都决心打败美国强盗，直到越南国土上再也没有一个美国侵略者的影子为止。
    声明指出，在美帝国主义“以炸迫和”的大阴谋中，苏联修正主义领导集团充当了头号帮凶的角色。声明说，苏联修正主义领导集团的这种卑鄙行径越来越被世界革命人民所识破，不管它怎样为美帝国主义奔走效劳，也挽救不了美国侵略者必然失败的命运。
    声明说，中越两国人民的战斗友谊和坚强团结，是战胜美帝国主义的最可靠的保证。美帝国主义的战争讹诈吓不倒越南人民，也吓不倒中国人民；它的花言巧语骗不了越南人民，也骗不了中国人民。
