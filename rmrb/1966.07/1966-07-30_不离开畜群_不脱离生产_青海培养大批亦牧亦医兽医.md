Qinghai now has over 5,000 veterinarians from the Tibetan, Hui, and Mongolian ethnic groups who are both herders and doctors. They have been active on the front lines of livestock production for many years, playing a significant role in promoting the development of livestock farming.

After the establishment of people's communes in the Qinghai grasslands, the training of veterinarians who do not leave production began among the herding people of various ethnic groups. Since 1962, local party organizations have strengthened the training of herder veterinarians, rapidly developing and improving this team. These herder veterinarians usually participate in collective labor such as herding, shearing, and breeding and raising young animals alongside community members. When it is necessary to prevent and treat animal diseases, they gather to carry out disease prevention and treatment. Herders praise them, saying: Veterinarians do not leave the herds and do not leave livestock production, discovering and treating animal diseases in a timely manner, which is very beneficial for the development of livestock production.

    不离开畜群  不脱离生产
    青海培养大批亦牧亦医兽医
    青海已有亦牧亦医的藏、回、蒙古等族兽医五千多名。他们长年活跃在牧业生产第一线，对帮助畜牧业的发展起了很大的作用。
    青海草原在成立人民公社以后，就开始在各族劳动牧民中培养不脱离生产的兽医人员。一九六二年以来，各地党组织加强了牧民兽医的培训工作，使这支队伍得到迅速发展和提高。这些牧民兽医平时和社员一样参加放牧、剪毛、接产育幼等集体劳动，需要防治畜病时，就集中起来进行防疫和治病。牧民称赞说：兽医不离开畜群，不脱离牧业生产，发现和医治畜病很及时，对发展牧业生产很有利。
