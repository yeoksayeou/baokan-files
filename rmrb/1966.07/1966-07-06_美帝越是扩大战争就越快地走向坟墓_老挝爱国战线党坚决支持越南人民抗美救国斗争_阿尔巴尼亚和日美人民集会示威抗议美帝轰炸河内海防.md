The more the U.S. imperialists expand the war, the faster they will head to the grave. The Pathet Lao Party resolutely supports the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The people of Albania and Japan hold rallies and demonstrations to protest the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Kengkay on July 5, the Pathet Lao Central Committee issued a statement on July 2, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' dispatch of aircraft to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong. The statement expresses warm support for the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on June 30, and resolves to fully support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

The statement says that President Johnson's order to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong is an extremely dangerous step to escalate the war, seriously threatening the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The statement points out that the U.S.'s actions further prove that all its "peace" talk is a cover for its military plans. The more cunning its "peace" talk, the more reckless and dangerous its military activities.

The statement says: The Pathet Lao Central Committee sternly warns the U.S. imperialists: the more they escalate, the more miserable their defeat; the more they expand the war, the deeper they will dig their own grave.

The statement points out that all the U.S. imperialists' frenzied actions are merely the desperate struggles of a cornered beast. The Vietnamese people's ironclad resolve to decisively defeat the U.S. aggressors has already won victories and will surely achieve greater victories. The U.S. imperialists will suffer even more miserable defeats.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana on July 5, the savage bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by U.S. aggressors has aroused great indignation among the Albanian people. In recent days, they have held rallies to angrily denounce and condemn the U.S. aggressors' criminal actions, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

The workers of Shkodër held a rally on July 4. Engineer Majia said at the rally, "We support the just struggle of our Vietnamese brothers against U.S. imperialists. We believe that the heroic Vietnamese people will surely win."

The workers of the Vlorë Cement Factory passed a resolution after holding a protest rally, strongly protesting against this new and serious act of aggression by U.S. imperialists.

The youth of Durres also held a protest rally. In a telegram to the Vietnamese youth, they pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong once again exposed their warlike nature.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on July 5, the people of various circles in Tokyo are expanding their protests against the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.

In Tokyo, about 10,000 young metal workers held a rally on July 3 and sent a protest telegram to U.S. President Johnson and Japanese Prime Minister Sato. About 2,000 workers in Osaka held a protest rally on July 2. Nine hundred dock workers in Kobe held a one-hour strike on July 1 and sent a protest letter to Johnson and Sato. About 200 representatives of some Japanese mass organizations went to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo on the morning of June 30 to deliver a protest letter to U.S. President Johnson. In the afternoon of June 30, representatives of eleven mass organizations went to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to protest. About 100 workers and other citizens protested in front of and around the embassy, continuously shouting slogans: "U.S. aggressors, get out of Vietnam!"

According to a report from the New China News Agency on July 5, the U.S. public continued to hold marches and demonstrations on July 4 to protest the Johnson administration's heinous crime of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong.

In Philadelphia, about 400 people, despite police suppression, held a demonstration and distributed leaflets on July 4, strongly condemning the U.S. government's escalation of the war in Vietnam. The "Vietnam Veterans and Reservists to End the War" organization held a rally and march in Philadelphia on July 3, protesting the U.S. government's policy of aggression against Vietnam and demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Vietnam. In Phoenix, Arizona, dozens of university students carried a coffin in a protest against the U.S. government sending Americans to die in South Vietnam.
