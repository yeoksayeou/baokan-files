Let Zhou Yang's "Mass Literature and Art" Go to Hell!

Tianjin Station "Gate Six" Old Worker Wei Helin

Chairman Mao taught us in his "Talk" that: "If you are a bourgeois literary and art worker, you will not sing the praises of the proletariat but of the bourgeoisie; if you are a proletarian literary and art worker, you will not sing the praises of the bourgeoisie but of the proletariat and the laboring people: you must be one or the other." Using this mirror to expose the demons, the counter-revolutionary nature of the anti-party, anti-socialist element Zhou Yang is revealed.

Zhou Yang advocates a "mass" brand of literature and art, which is completely black goods! We workers and the bourgeoisie, other exploiters, have always been mortal enemies, with no common feelings, no common language, so how can there be a "mass" literature and art that everyone enjoys!

I am an old worker from "Gate Six." My personal experience has made me deeply understand: without the Party, the three big mountains could not be overthrown, and the laboring people would not be liberated; without the Party, there would be no great victories in the socialist revolution; without the Party, there would be nothing. Just take "Gate Six" as an example. Before liberation, it was simply a living hell. Workers all said bitterly: "If you want to eat, you have to risk your life." The capitalists and their henchmen treated us like slaves, forcing us to carry heavy goods weighing five or six hundred jin. We worked under the stars and returned home under the moon, working more than ten hours a day with heavy physical labor, yet we still couldn't earn enough to buy two jin of mixed flour. The foremen colluded with imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries to carry out bloody persecution of the workers. From 1892 when "Gate Six" was established to 1949 when it was liberated, over 57 years, how many workers starved to death, froze to death, were beaten to death by foremen and secret agents, or were crushed to death or injured by goods, who can count them all! One day in 1941, while I was working in the yard, I was so hungry that I couldn't hold on. I saw some sugar sprinkled on the ground, and I scooped up a handful of dirt and sugar. Immediately, the yard's secret agent saw me and, without a word, sent me to the police station. They poured cold water on me, gave me electric shocks, and tortured me for over a month. I fainted several times and almost died. Later, with the enlightenment and help of underground Party workers, I found the Party. After national liberation, the three big mountains oppressing the laboring people were overthrown. The stevedores, who were once called "stinky big guys" by the bourgeoisie, became the masters of the state. Only then did we truly stand up politically and economically. Zhou Yang and his gang of ghosts and snakes use "mass literature and art" as a cover to pave the way for counter-revolutionary restoration, to let the capitalists ride roughshod over us again. This is a pipe dream! In a class society, the interests of each class are completely different, and there is no such thing as literature and art that serves all classes, that serves the "masses." What "mass literature and art," let it go to hell!

We will never forget that the Party is our great savior, the Party is our guide in building socialism and communism. Father and mother are not as dear as the Party. Our fate is closely tied to the Party. Zhou Yang wants to oppose the Party, oppose socialism, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, which is to oppose the lifeblood of us laboring people. We workers, peasants, and soldiers will fight him to the end, and we will also educate our laboring people's descendants to fight to the end with all ghosts and snakes!

　　让周扬的“全民文艺”见鬼去吧！
　　天津站“六号门”老工人　魏鹤林
    毛主席在《讲话》中教导我们说：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”用这面照妖镜来照反党反社会主义分子周扬的言行，他的反革命原形就露底了。
    周扬提倡什么“全民”牌的文艺，这完全是黑货！我们工人阶级与资产阶级、其他剥削者从来都是死对头，根本没有任何共同的感情，没有任何共同的语言，哪里会有什么“全民”共同享受的文艺！
    我是“六号门”的老工人，亲身的经历使我深刻认识到：没有党，就推不倒三座大山，我们劳动人民就得不到解放；没有党，就没有社会主义革命的巨大胜利；没有党，就没有一切。就拿我们“六号门”来说吧，解放前简直是一座活地狱。工人都沉痛地说：“要吃脚行饭，就得拿命换。”资本家和他们的爪牙把我们当成奴隶，强迫我们扛五六百斤重的大件货物。我们披着星星上工，戴着月亮下工，一天干十几个小时的超重体力劳动，可是还挣不到买二斤“杂合面”的钱。把头们勾结帝国主义和国民党反动派，对工人进行了血腥的迫害。自一八九二年“六号门”建场到一九四九年解放，五十七年来，饿死、冻死、被把头特务打死以及被货物砸死砸伤的工人有多少，谁能够计算出来呵！一九四一年的一天，我在货场干活时，自己饿的实在支持不住，看到地下零零星星的撒着一些糖末，我连土带糖抓了一把，当即被货场的特务看见，不由分说，就把我送到警务段，灌凉水，过电，折腾了一个多月，晕死过好几次，差一点送了命。以后在党的地下工作者的启发和帮助下，我找到了党。全国解放后，压在劳动人民头上的三座大山被推翻了，过去被资产阶级称作“臭扛大个”的装卸工人，成了国家的主人，我们才从政治上、经济上彻底翻了身。
    解放后，党又领导我们大搞技术革新和技术革命，把装卸工人从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来。在企业管理工作中，党充分发扬民主，实行了职工代表大会制度，许多装卸工人当选为职工代表，管理国家企业。这一切，在旧社会都是我们连做梦都不敢想的，在党的领导下却成了现实。周扬这伙牛鬼蛇神用“全民文艺”作幌子，想为反革命复辟鸣锣开道，想让资本家重新骑在我们头上，这是梦想！在阶级社会里，各个阶级的利益是完全不同的，根本不存在为各阶级、为“全民”服务的文艺。什么“全民文艺”，让它见鬼去吧！
    我们永远也忘不了党是解放我们的大救星，党是我们建设社会主义、共产主义的领路人。爹亲娘亲不如党亲，我们的命运和党紧紧连在一起。周扬要反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想，就是反对我们劳动人民的命根子，我们工农兵要和他斗到底，而且还要教育我们劳动人民的后代，同一切牛鬼蛇神拚到底！
