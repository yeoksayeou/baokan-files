The Joint Statement on Cultural Exchange Between the Peoples of China and Japan was signed today in Beijing.

Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and Honorary Chairman of the China-Japan Friendship Association Guo Moruo, and Chairman of the China-Japan Friendship Association Liao Chengzhi, attended the signing ceremony.

Signing on behalf of the Chinese side was Chu Tu-nan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries; signing on behalf of the Japanese side was Nakajima Kenzo, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association.

The full text of the Joint Statement on Cultural Exchange Between the Peoples of China and Japan is as follows:

At a time when the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers is being held in Beijing to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, and when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being carried out throughout China, Nakajima Kenzo, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, visited China in June 1966 at the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. He held cordial and friendly talks with Chu Tu-nan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and with responsible persons of various relevant cultural organizations in China. It was confirmed that the promotion of cultural exchange between the peoples of China and Japan and the consolidation of friendship and unity between the two peoples are in full accord with the common aspirations of the peoples of the two countries.

Both sides confirmed that the cultural exchange carried out in accordance with the Joint Statement on Cultural Exchange Between the Peoples of China and Japan signed in Beijing on December 8, 1965, has been more active than ever before and has achieved more than expected results. This brilliant achievement has been made with the broad and enthusiastic support of the peoples of the two countries and in the face of the increasingly urgent situation of the Asian continent being subjected to the shameless aggression of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices.

Since the signing of the Joint Statement on Cultural Exchange Between the Peoples of China and Japan in 1959, both sides have repeatedly confirmed that cultural exchange in the fields of literature, art, academics, science, journalism, sports, and religion serves the common interests and aspirations of the peoples of the two countries. This cultural exchange cannot be destroyed by any tricks and conspiracies played by forces that are hostile to Sino-Japanese friendship, insist on the plot of "two Chinas," and obstruct the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. It will, with the passage of time, lay an important foundation for the future prosperity of the two countries and the strengthening of mutual unity. In the current urgent situation, both sides once again expressed their firm confidence and, filled with friendship, agreed to cooperate more closely in the future.

    中日两国人民进一步加强友好和团结
    双方签订两国人民文化交流共同声明
    据新华社五日讯　关于中日两国人民之间的文化交流的共同声明，今天在北京签字。
    全国文联主席、中日友好协会名誉会长郭沫若，中日友好协会会长廖承志，出席了签字仪式。
    代表中国方面签字的是，中国人民对外文化友好协会会长楚图南；代表日本方面签字的是，日本中国文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏。
    关于中日两国人民之间的文化交流的共同声明全文如下：
    正当在北京召开亚非作家紧急会议、支持越南人民进行反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争、在中国开展全国范围的文化大革命的时候，日本中国文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏应中国人民对外文化友好协会的邀请，于一九六六年六月访问了中国，并同中国人民对外文化友好协会会长楚图南以及中国各文化界有关团体的负责人进行了亲密友好的会谈，确认日益促进日中两国人民之间的文化交流、巩固两国人民的友好和团结，完全符合两国人民的共同愿望。
    双方确认，根据一九六五年十二月八日在北京签订的“关于中日两国人民间文化交流的共同声明”而进行的文化交流，比以往更加活跃，并且收到了预期以上的效果。这一辉煌成果是在两国人民广泛而热烈的支持下取得的，是在亚洲遭到美帝国主义及其同谋者的无耻侵略形势日趋紧迫的情况下取得的。
    自从一九五九年签订“关于中日两国人民间文化交流的联合声明”以来，双方曾经屡次确认过，在文学、艺术、学术、科学、报道、体育、宗教等各方面进行文化交流，是符合两国人民共同利益的共同愿望。这种文化交流不管敌视中日友好、坚持“两个中国”的阴谋、阻挠中日邦交正常化的势力玩弄什么阴谋诡计，都是破坏不了的，它将随着时间的前进，为争取两国未来的繁荣、加强相互的团结，奠定重要的基础。在形势紧迫的当前时期，双方再次表示了坚定的信心，并且充满友情地约定，今后更加紧密地进行合作。
    中国人民对外文化友好协会会长　楚图南
    日本中国文化交流协会理事长　中岛健藏
