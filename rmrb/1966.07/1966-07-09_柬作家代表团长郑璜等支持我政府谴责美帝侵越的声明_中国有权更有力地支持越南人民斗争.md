	Cambodian Writers' Delegation Head Zheng Huan Supports Our Government's Condemnation of U.S. Aggression in Vietnam
	China Has the Right to Provide More Powerful Support for the Vietnamese People's Struggle

	New China News Agency, July 6th: The head of the Cambodian delegation to the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, Zheng Huan, issued a statement today regarding the U.S. imperialists' savage bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong and the Chinese government's statement on this matter. The full text of the statement is as follows:

		(1) On the Bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong

		We strongly condemn the recent savage, shameless, and provocative bombing of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (Hanoi) and the industrial city of Haiphong by the U.S. imperialists.

		This crime exposes the fraudulence of Johnson's proposed peace talks.

		This desperate act of aggression indeed reveals the plight of a dying aggressor.

		This act of blackmail aims to force the heroic Vietnamese people to surrender to the arrogant U.S. imperialists.

		The U.S. aggressors once again trampled on the sovereignty and independence of the Vietnamese people, shamelessly violating the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Vietnamese question, and destroying the most basic principles of international law.

		The Cambodian writers, united around the chairman of the People's Socialist Community, Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and the entire Cambodian people, have always steadfastly and wholeheartedly supported our Vietnamese brothers who are bravely fighting against the U.S. aggressors.

		We reaffirm our resolute support for the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

		(2) On the Chinese Government's Statement Condemning the U.S. Bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong

		We fully agree with the statement issued by the People's Republic of China on July 3, 1966. The statement of the People's Republic of China supports the Vietnamese people in their struggle against the U.S. imperialist aggressors until the aggressors are decisively and thoroughly eliminated.

		According to this statement, great China has always, consistently, and unreservedly, and to the best of its ability, provided political, moral, material, and other forms of support and aid to Vietnam.

		All countries and peoples of Asia and Africa, who are fighting to establish a new world without imperialism and without old and new colonialism, place their hopes entirely on China.

		According to a report by the New China News Agency in Damascus on July 7th, Nasser Ismail, the acting head of the Omani mission in Damascus, angrily condemned the U.S. aggressors' expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam in a conversation with a New China News Agency reporter.

		When discussing the Chinese government's statement condemning the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, he pointed out that since the U.S. aggressors have expanded their war of aggression against Vietnam, China has the right to take more powerful measures to support the Vietnamese people's anti-aggression war.

    柬作家代表团长郑璜等支持我政府谴责美帝侵越的声明
    中国有权更有力地支持越南人民斗争
    新华社六日讯　出席亚非作家紧急会议的柬埔寨代表团团长郑璜今天就美帝国主义野蛮轰炸河内和海防及中国政府就此发表的声明发表了一项声明。声明全文如下：
    （一）对河内和海防的轰炸
    我们最强烈地谴责美帝国主义者最近对越南民主共和国首都（河内）和工业城市海防进行的野蛮、无耻和挑衅性的轰炸。
    这一罪行暴露了约翰逊所建议的和谈是个大骗局。
    在绝望中犯下的这一罪行的确表明了作垂死挣扎者的窘境。
    这种进行讹诈的罪行力图迫使英雄的越南人民向蛮横的美帝国主义者投降。
    美国侵略者再一次践踏了越南人民的主权和独立，无耻地破坏了一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，破坏了国际法最基本的准则。
    团结在人民社会同盟主席、国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王周围的柬埔寨作家们和全体柬埔寨人民，始终不渝地全力支持为反对美国侵略者而英勇地进行斗争的我们的越南兄弟们。
    我们重申，我们坚决支持越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。
    （二）中国政府谴责美国轰炸河内和海防的声明
    我们完全同意中华人民共和国一九六六年七月三日的声明，中华人民共和国的声明支持为反对美帝国主义侵略者而斗争的越南人民，直到坚决和彻底地消灭美帝国主义侵略者为止。
    根据这项声明，伟大的中国从来一贯地、无保留地、尽一切可能从政治上、道义上、物质上并且从其他方面给予越南以支持和援助。
    正在为争取建立一个没有帝国主义、没有新老殖民主义的新世界而斗争的一切国家和亚非各国人民完全把希望寄托于中国。
    据新华社大马士革七日电　阿曼驻大马士革办事处代办纳赛尔·伊斯梅利七日在向新华社记者发表谈话时，愤怒谴责美国侵略者扩大侵略越南的战争。
    在谈到中国政府谴责美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防的声明时，他指出，既然美国侵略者扩大侵略越南的战争，中国就有权采取更有力的办法支持越南人民的反侵略战争。
