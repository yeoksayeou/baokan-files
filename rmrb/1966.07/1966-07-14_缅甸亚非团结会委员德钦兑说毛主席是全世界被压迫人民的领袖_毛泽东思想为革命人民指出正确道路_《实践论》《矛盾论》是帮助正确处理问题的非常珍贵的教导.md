Burmese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee Member De Zhen Du Says Chairman Mao is the Leader of the Oppressed People of the World
Mao Zedong Thought Points the Way for Revolutionary People
"Practice" and "On Contradiction" Are Precious Guidance for Correctly Handling Issues

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, July 12th – Burmese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee Member De Zhen Du recently received a Xinhua News Agency reporter and said: "Mao Zedong Thought is not only the revolutionary beacon for 700 million Chinese people, but also the revolutionary beacon for the oppressed and exploited people of the world. Chairman Mao is not only the leader of China, but also the leader of the oppressed and exploited people of the world."

	De Zhen Du said: "Mao Zedong Thought deeply roots in the hearts of anti-imperialist people of various countries, in the hearts of workers who are smashing capitalism, and in the hearts of laboring people who are opposing oppression and exploitation. Revolutionary people of the world and the political parties of the working class leading the revolution regard Mao Zedong Thought as their guide in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary thoughts and further promote the revolution."

	He said: "Mao Zedong Thought provides the key to solving problems according to dialectical materialism. Mao Zedong's 'Practice' and 'On Contradiction' are extremely precious guidance for correctly and accurately handling and solving problems."

	He said, at a time when modern revisionists are trying to sabotage the revolutionary forces of the people of various countries and hinder the development of the revolution, Mao Zedong Thought is an effective revolutionary weapon. It cuts off the evil hands of modern revisionists who attempt to blunt the revolutionary edge of the laboring people, making the revolutionary edge even sharper.

	De Zhen Du said: "The attempts of revisionists to obstruct the anti-imperialist struggle and the world people's revolution will never succeed. Because Mao Zedong Thought is raising (people's) revolutionary consciousness, inspiring revolutionary spirit, and pointing out the correct path." He pointed out: "Today, the main task of Marxists-Leninists is to smash the revisionism that distorts the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, creates chaos in the ranks of the working class, and undermines the unity of the international communist movement. We must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought to accomplish this task."

	De Zhen Du said: "Mao Zedong Thought is a very sharp sword to cut off the heads of modern revisionists." He said: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the People's Republic of China stands at the forefront of the struggle against the common enemy of the world's people—the U.S. imperialist's interference, aggression, and intimidation." "The People's Republic of China is the pillar of the world's people's independence and peace." "People who love independence and peace trust the People's Republic of China. Because the People's Republic of China takes a firm stance, the revolutionary movements of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries to seek independence, peace, and prosperity, and to oppose imperialism, have been strengthened. Because the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries clearly know that the People's Republic of China is the most loyal friend of the anti-imperialist people of these countries, they are even more powerful in their revolutionary struggle against imperialism."

　　缅甸亚非团结会委员德钦兑说毛主席是全世界被压迫人民的领袖
　　毛泽东思想为革命人民指出正确道路
　　《实践论》《矛盾论》是帮助正确处理问题的非常珍贵的教导
    据新华社仰光十二日电　缅甸亚非团结委员会委员德钦兑最近接见新华社记者时说：“毛泽东思想不仅是七亿中国人民的革命灯塔，并且也是世界被压迫和被剥削人民的革命灯塔。毛主席不仅是中国的领袖，而且是世界被压迫和被剥削人民的领袖。”
    德钦兑说：“毛泽东思想深深扎根在各国反帝人民的心中，扎根在粉碎资本主义的工人的心中，扎根在反对压迫和剥削的劳动人民的心中。世界革命人民和领导革命的工人阶级政党把毛泽东思想看作是他们在消灭反革命思想和进一步促进革命的斗争中的指南。”
    他说：“毛泽东思想为按照辩证唯物主义解决问题提供了钥匙。毛泽东的《实践论》和《矛盾论》是帮助正确地和确切地处理和解决问题的非常珍贵的教导。”
    他说，在现代修正主义者试图破坏各国的人民革命力量、阻挠革命向前发展的时候，毛泽东思想是有效的革命武器，它斩断那些试图挫折劳动人民的革命锋芒的现代修正主义者的罪恶之手，使革命锋芒更加锐利。
    德钦兑说：“修正主义者阻挠反帝斗争和世界人民革命的企图决不能得逞。因为毛泽东思想正在提高（人们的）革命觉悟，激励革命精神和指出正确的道路。”他指出：“今天，马克思列宁主义者的主要任务是粉碎破坏马克思列宁主义基本原则、在工人阶级队伍中制造混乱和破坏国际共产主义运动团结的修正主义。我们必须用毛泽东思想武装起来完成这项任务。”
    德钦兑说：“毛泽东思想是砍掉现代修正主义脑袋的一支十分锐利的宝剑。”他说：“毛主席领导下的人民中国屹立在反对世界人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义的干涉、侵略和威吓的斗争的最前线。”“人民中国是世界人民独立与和平的支柱。”“爱好独立与和平的人民信赖人民中国。由于人民中国采取坚定不移的立场，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民争取独立、和平与繁荣、反对帝国主义的革命运动加强了。因为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民明确知道，人民中国是这些国家反帝人民最忠实的朋友，所以他们更加有力地展开反对帝国主义的革命斗争。”（附图片）
