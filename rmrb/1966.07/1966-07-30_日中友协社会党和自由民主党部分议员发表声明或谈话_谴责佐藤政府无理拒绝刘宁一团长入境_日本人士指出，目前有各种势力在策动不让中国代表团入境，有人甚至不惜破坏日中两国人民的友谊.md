The Japan-China Friendship Association and some members of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party and the Socialist Party have issued statements or made remarks condemning the Sato government's unreasonable refusal to allow Liu Ningyi, the head of the Chinese delegation, to enter Japan.

Japanese individuals have pointed out that various forces are currently scheming to prevent the Chinese delegation from entering the country. Some people are even willing to sabotage the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China.

New China News Agency, Tokyo, July 29 - The Japan-China Friendship Association and some members of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party and the Socialist Party have issued statements or made remarks, protesting and condemning the Sato government's unreasonable refusal to allow Liu Ningyi, the head of the Chinese delegation, to participate in the 12th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Japan.

The Japan-China Friendship Association issued a statement on July 27 saying: "We, together with the broad masses of the people who yearn for peace in Asia and friendship between Japan and China, protest against the Sato government's unreasonable refusal to allow Liu Ningyi to enter the country and demand the immediate revocation of this decision."

The statement said: "Liu Ningyi is a vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China and a vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace. He is a leader who truly represents the peace movement of the 700 million Chinese people. As the head of the Chinese delegation to the first World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, he has visited Japan several times." The statement said, "Refusing entry to such a person is a deliberate attempt to sabotage Japan-China relations and is an act of provocation in response to the U.S. continuous expansion of the Vietnam War."

The statement pointed out that the Japanese government's reason for refusing Liu Ningyi's entry is absurd. "It is clear that this is a groundless excuse to deceive our people."

Liberal Democratic Party member of the Diet, Kenzo Matsumura, told a Chinese reporter that the Japanese government's decision is absurd. He said, "The more the Sato government does this, the more it will be to its disadvantage."

Liberal Democratic Party member of the Diet, Kijitsu Furui, said that the Japanese government's decision is "unpleasant and awkward." He said, "We hope that Japan-China relations will develop in a good direction and do not want to see such unpleasant situations." Furui said that the Japanese government's decision to refuse Liu Ningyi's entry was first announced by the Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and the Ministry of Justice announced it later. He said, "I feel very sorry and regretful about this, and I even suspect whether someone in the Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs wants to mess things up rather than improve them."

Liberal Democratic Party member of the Diet, Tokuma Utsunomiya, said that the Japanese government's unreasonable decision is "an impolite action towards Chinese politicians and an impolite and unreasonable measure to improve Japan-China relations." He said, "Currently, various forces are scheming to prevent the Chinese delegation from entering the country, and some people are even willing to sabotage the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China." He pointed out, "The issue of not allowing the head of the Chinese delegation to enter the country is an impolite and insulting act towards China."

Socialist Party member of the Diet, Shichiro Suike, said that the Japanese government's refusal to allow Liu Ningyi to enter the country "is not just a matter of participating in or not participating in the World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, but also a major issue concerning Japan-China trade and friendship." He said that he would continue to work for the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China.

According to reports, the Japanese government's unreasonable refusal to allow Liu Ningyi to enter the country was made shortly after U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk visited Japan and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko's extensive activities in Japan. After the Soviet Peace Committee sent a telegram to the Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs on July 25 expressing its intention to send a delegation to participate in the 12th World Conference, the decision was made in a sudden attack manner to notify the Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. The Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs announced this to the press half an hour after receiving the notification. All of this is not accidental.

New China News Agency, Tokyo, July 29 - The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement on the afternoon of July 28, protesting the Sato government's unreasonable refusal to allow Liu Ningyi, the head of the Chinese delegation to the 12th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, to enter the country.

The statement pointed out that the Japanese government's action this time is another arbitrary act following the refusal to allow the delegation from the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, invited by the Socialist Party, to enter the country. The statement expressed that the Japanese Socialist Party strongly condemns the Japanese government's action and will, together with the Japanese people, fight for Liu Ningyi and the delegation from the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, invited by the Socialist Party, to enter the country.

It was also reported that on July 28, Yuichi Yamamoto, head of the International Bureau of the Socialist Party, Shohachi Harada, chairman of the Special Committee for Restoring Japan-China Relations of the Socialist Party, and Shinro Kobayashi, secretary-general of the Socialist Party, met with Toshimitsu Hashimoto, chief cabinet secretary, and demanded that the Sato government revoke the decision to refuse Liu Ningyi's entry. Hashimoto stubbornly stated that "the government's established policy cannot be changed."

    谴责佐藤政府无理拒绝刘宁一团长入境
    日本人士指出，目前有各种势力在策动不让中国代表团入境，有人甚至不惜破坏日中两国人民的友谊
    新华社东京二十九日电　日中友好协会和日本自由民主党、社会党一部分国会议员分别发表声明或谈话，抗议和谴责佐藤政府无理拒绝中国代表团团长刘宁一前来日本参加第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会。
    日中友好协会二十七日发表声明说：“我们与热望亚洲和平与日中友好的广大国民一起，抗议佐藤政府无理拒绝刘宁一入境，要求立即撤销这一决定。”
    声明说：“刘宁一是中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的副委员长、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的副主席，是不愧为代表中国七亿人民的和平运动的领导者。他作为参加第一届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的中国代表团团长访日以来，曾几次作为团长访问过日本。”声明说，“拒绝这样的人入境，是蓄意破坏日中关系，是与美国不断扩大侵略越南战争相呼应的挑衅行为。”
    声明指出，日本政府拒绝刘宁一团长入境的理由是荒谬绝伦的。“很明显，这是欺骗我国国民的无端借口”。
    自由民主党国会议员松村谦三对中国记者说，日本政府的决定是荒诞的。他说，“佐藤政府越是这样做，就越对它不利。”
    自由民主党国会议员古井喜实说，日本政府的这个决定是“令人不愉快和令人为难的”。他说：“我们希望日中关系能朝着好的方向发展，不希望出现象这样令人不愉快的事态”。古井说，日本政府拒绝刘宁一入境的决定是日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会首先公布的，而法务省是随后才公布的。他说，“我对此感到非常遗憾和惋惜，我甚至怀疑，是否日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会有人要把事情搞坏，而不是想把事情搞好”。
    自由民主党国会议员宇都宫德马说，日本政府的无理决定，“是对中国政治家的无礼行动，是对改善日中关系的非礼和无理的措施”。他说，“目前，有各种势力在策动不让中国代表团入境，有人甚至不惜破坏日中两国人民的友谊”。他指出，“不许中国代表团团长入境的问题是对中国的一个不礼貌和侮辱”。
    社会党国会议员穗积七郎说，日本政府拒绝刘宁一团长入境，“这不仅是参加不参加禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的问题，而是涉及到日中贸易、日中友好的大问题”。他表示，要“继续为日中两国人民友好而尽力”。
    据报道，日本政府无理拒绝刘宁一团长入境的决定，是在美国国务卿腊斯克访问日本之后不久，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯来日本大肆活动，苏联和平委员会二十五日致电日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会表示派代表团参加第十二届世界大会以后作出，以突然袭击的方式通知日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会的。而日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会在接到这个通知的半小时后就匆忙向报界公布。所有这一切决不是偶然的。
    新华社东京二十九日电　日本社会党二十八日下午发表声明，抗议佐藤政府无理拒绝出席第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的中国代表团团长刘宁一入境。
    声明指出，日本政府的这次措施，是继拒绝社会党邀请的中国人民外交学会代表团入境之后的又一次蛮横行动。声明表示，日本社会党严厉谴责日本政府的这一行动，并将和日本人民一起为实现刘宁一和社会党邀请的中国人民外交学会代表团入境而斗争。
    又据报道，社会党国际局长山本幸一、社会党恢复日中邦交特别委员会委员长原彪和事务局长小林进二十八日会见了日本内阁官房长官桥本登美三郎，要求佐藤政府撤销拒绝刘宁一团长入境的决定。桥本顽固地表示“不能改变政府的既定方针”。
