Chicago blacks launched a violent struggle. Over five thousand people took to the streets in protest, chanting "Black Power." Armed protesters exchanged gunfire with police.

New China News Agency, July 16th: Chicago news: On the night of the 14th, in the third consecutive night of violent self-defense, nearly a thousand armed police engaged in a fierce battle with over five thousand black protesters. Some armed blacks also exchanged gunfire with the police who were shooting at them.

According to the Associated Press, the struggle had not subsided by the morning of the 16th and showed signs of spreading to the southern black residential areas of the city.

The U.S. news agency reported in shock that this was the largest and most fierce violent struggle by blacks in Chicago in decades. What particularly worried the U.S. ruling class was that the protesting blacks began to chant the slogan of the oppressed, exploited, and discriminated two million black laborers in the U.S.: "Black Power!" This struggle was a massive outburst of the long-standing discontent of the black masses crammed in the slums of Chicago against their extremely impoverished and powerless situation. The spark was the police's forced closure of fire hydrants, preventing black children suffering from the heat from using the water to cool off. Enraged by the police's brutal action, thousands of black protesters (mostly young people) took to the streets in protest on the 12th and 13th nights. They bravely fought back when faced with police brutality.

On the night of the 14th, the number of protesters swelled to over five thousand, and the areas affected by the struggle expanded several times over from the previous two nights, covering an area of nine square miles. Nearly a thousand fully armed police carried out savage suppression, indiscriminately firing at the black crowds. Groups of black youth used bricks, tiles, and homemade Molotov cocktails as weapons to fight back against the police; some armed blacks also engaged in prolonged gun battles with the police. Some people sniped from rooftops and dark windows, wounding several police who were attacking blacks. Meanwhile, more black residents threw broken glass and garbage from the windows on both sides of the street at the police, or shouted encouragement. The usually arrogant police were now cowering under police cars or hiding in sewers, in a state of utter chaos.

An Associated Press report from Chicago on the 16th said that the area had become a "battle zone," with gunshots, shouts, and police car sirens blending into one. The protesting blacks also set fire to some pawn shops and other white-owned stores that had been exploiting them, with flames shooting up into the sky.

A small group of right-wing leaders in the black movement tried to persuade the black crowds to lay down their weapons and stop fighting, but no one paid any attention to them.

The Illinois state authorities, terrified by the blacks' brave struggle, ordered three thousand National Guard soldiers to enter the black areas on the night of the 15th, armed with various long and short guns, including machine guns, and tear gas, to carry out violent suppression. Preliminary statistics show that in the three nights of struggle, three blacks were killed by the military police, dozens were injured, and over three hundred were arrested.

The struggle of Chicago's blacks is the third large-scale violent self-defense struggle by U.S. blacks in the past three years. In August 1964, blacks in New York's Harlem first launched a nearly ten-day struggle of violent self-defense against violent suppression, marking the beginning of violent struggles by U.S. blacks. In August 1965, blacks in Los Angeles' Watts area launched an even more massive and powerful anti-violence struggle, adding a new chapter to the history of U.S. black struggles.

　　芝加哥黑人掀起暴力斗争
　　五千多人上街示威高呼“黑人要权力”
　　带枪的示威群众同武装警察进行对射
    新华社十六日讯　芝加哥消息：美国第二大城市芝加哥市黑人群众五千多人十四日晚间在接连第三夜的暴力自卫斗争中，同近千名武装警察展开了彻夜的英勇搏斗；一些带枪的黑人还同开枪行凶的警察展开了对射。
    据合众国际社报道，这一斗争到十六日清晨为止，仍未平息，并且有向城南黑人聚居区扩展的趋势。
    这家美国通讯社惊魂不定地指出，这是几十年来芝加哥黑人最大、最勇猛的一次暴力斗争；特别使美国统治集团不安的是，示威黑人开始喊出了备受歧视、压迫、剥削的两千万美国黑人劳动群众的呼声：“黑人要权力！”这次斗争是拥塞在芝加哥贫民窟内的黑人群众长期以来对于他们所处的极端贫困、无权的处境强烈不满的一次大爆发，而导火线则是由于警方强制关闭消防龙头，不让贫民窟内为酷热所苦的黑人少年儿童放水淋浴。被警方这一蛮横行动激怒了的上千名黑人群众（绝大多数是青年）在十二日和十三日接连两晚涌上街头示威抗议；他们在遭到警察野蛮镇压时，英勇进行了自卫。
    十四日晚间，参加示威的黑人激增到五千多人，斗争波及地区也比前两晚扩大了好几倍，方圆达九平方英里。近千名全副武装的警察进行残暴镇压，任意向黑人群众开枪。成群的黑人青年用砖头、瓦块和自制燃烧瓶作为自卫的武器，同警察进行英勇的斗争；一些带枪的黑人还同警察展开了长时间的对射；有些人从屋顶，从漆黑的楼窗口进行狙击，打伤了好几名向黑人行凶的警察。同时，更多的黑人居民，也纷纷从街道两旁的楼窗口向警察倾倒玻璃碎片和垃圾助战，或是大声呐喊助威。平常横行霸道的警察，这时有的吓得躲到警车下面，有的钻进阴沟里，狼狈万状。
    合众国际社十六日从芝加哥发出的一则报道说，这个地区已经成了一个“战斗地区”，枪声、呐喊声、警车声交织成一片；示威黑人还放火烧毁了一些平日吮吸他们膏血的白人店铺，特别是当铺，火光冲天。
    一小撮黑人运动的右派头目妄图劝说黑人群众放下武器，停止战斗，但是，根本没人理睬他们。
    被黑人群众的英勇斗争吓得心惊胆战的伊利诺斯州当局，悍然下令三千名国民警卫队士兵在十五日晚间携带包括轻机枪在内的各种长短枪枝和催泪瓦斯开进黑人区进行暴力镇压。据初步统计，在接连三夜的斗争中，有三名黑人被军警杀害，数十人被打伤，三百多人被捕。
    芝加哥黑人的这场斗争，是三年来美国黑人举行的第三次大规模暴力自卫斗争。一九六四年八月，纽约市哈莱姆区黑人首先掀起了一场延续近十日的以暴力自卫反对暴力镇压的斗争，揭开了美国黑人暴力斗争的序幕；一九六五年八月，洛杉矶市瓦茨区的黑人又展开了一场声势和规模更加浩大的抗暴斗争，在美国黑人斗争史上写下了一页新篇章。
