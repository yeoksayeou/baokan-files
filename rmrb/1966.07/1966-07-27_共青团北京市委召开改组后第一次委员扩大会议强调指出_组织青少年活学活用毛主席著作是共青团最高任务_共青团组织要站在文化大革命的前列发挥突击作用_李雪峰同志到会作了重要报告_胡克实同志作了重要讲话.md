The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League held its first expanded meeting after reorganization from July 3 to 11. The meeting unanimously adopted the resolution "Let the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought Forever Fly High in the Youth Work of the Capital." The meeting called on all young people and revolutionary youth in the city to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive for all actions, firmly support the Party's leadership, and loyally execute the Party's policies. The meeting vowed to sweep away all ghosts and monsters and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

This meeting was held under the direct leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. It was a historic meeting in the youth movement of the capital. Li Xuefeng, the First Secretary of the Central-South Bureau of the Communist Party of China and the First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave an important speech. Hu Kesheng, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, also gave an important speech.

The meeting exposed and criticized the crimes of the former Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, which had vigorously promoted the revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. The meeting focused on discussing how the youth organizations in the capital could lead the broad masses of young people to stand at the forefront of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, consciously undergo the tempering of this class struggle, and play a vanguard role for the Communist Youth League. The attendees unanimously agreed that the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital is excellent, with a momentum like a surging tide and the force of thunder, ushering in a new high tide. Revolutionary young people are the pioneers of the Cultural Revolution. They display great revolutionary daring, charge into the fray, and are invincible. In the movement, they weather storms and gain experience, raising their class consciousness and receiving the most profound education and practical tempering. The attendees further realized that the Cultural Revolution is a sharp, complex, and intense class struggle, a struggle against capitalist restoration, against counter-revolutionary coups, and against the seizure of power by the revisionist clique.

The meeting believed that this Cultural Revolution is a great classroom for young people to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and a great furnace for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolution. In a sense, the Cultural Revolution is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over the younger generation. It is also a struggle where the older generation of revolutionaries leads the younger generation to make revolution. In the socialist period, when the class enemy attacks us, they often direct their spears at two aspects: they try every means to seize the leadership in various fields from the proletariat, and they try every means to seize the younger generation from the proletariat. The struggle for the younger generation is an important part of the class struggle in the entire socialist period. The Communist Youth League organization is a powerful assistant to the Party. Whether it guides the youth to follow Chairman Mao or becomes a tool of the bourgeoisie's careerists, leading the youth to follow the revisionists, is a struggle between two lines in youth work in the socialist period. We must draw profound lessons from the degeneration of the former Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League.

The meeting emphasized that from this great test of class struggle in the Cultural Revolution, we have drawn a fundamental experience: to avoid losing direction in political storms, we must truly study Mao Zedong Thought well. Mao Zedong Thought is our political direction and the highest directive for all our actions. As long as we master this most powerful ideological weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, we can distinguish between friends and enemies, stand firm, discern right from wrong, and always stand unshakable.

The meeting believed that the attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, between true revolution and false revolution. A revolutionary must support Mao Zedong Thought, act according to Mao Zedong Thought, and have unlimited love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought. The main leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League promoted a revisionist line in youth work. They vigorously opposed and sabotaged the movement for young people to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. They advocated the slogans of "voluntary participation, free association, self-determined time, and self-selected content," which in reality meant laissez-faire, abolitionism, and were slogans of bourgeois liberalization. This caused some young people and youth league cadres in Beijing to be disarmed ideologically and lose their political direction. Some people, because they could not distinguish between true and false, blindly executed the revisionist line, became politically confused, and became mouthpieces for revisionism. The lesson is clear: the most fundamental reason is that they did not seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works and did not master Mao Zedong Thought, this political telescope and microscope.

Therefore, the meeting emphasized that the highest task and greatest politics of the Communist Youth League is to mobilize, organize, and lead the broad masses of young people to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, master Mao Zedong Thought, and enhance the young people's ability to resist restoration, subversion, and peaceful evolution. They must learn to criticize various bourgeois "authorities," "ancestors," and representative figures. In the great storm of class struggle, they must cultivate and temper successors to the proletarian revolution, thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, and deeply plant the roots of Mao Zedong Thought. The meeting decided that it must make organizing young people to study and apply, and greatly use Chairman Mao's works the first major task after the establishment of the new Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the most fundamental mark of distinguishing itself from the revisionist leadership of the former Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League.

The meeting emphasized that mobilizing the masses and using the methods of mass movement to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great innovation of the Party and Chairman Mao. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings and believe in the Party and the masses at all times. We must combine the leadership of the Party with the revolutionary actions of millions of young people.

In the Cultural Revolution, the youth league organization must resolutely implement democratic centralism and thoroughly follow the mass line. Fear of the masses is not true revolution, and suppressing the revolutionary left is counter-revolutionary behavior. We must understand that without democracy, there can be no correct centralism. Without high democracy, there can be no high centralism. Centralism is not about imposing rules and regulations on the mass movement, but about concentrating the correct opinions of the masses to make the mass movement, under the leadership of the Party, more lively, more magnificent, and more surging.

To better mobilize the young masses, we must give the Party's policies to the masses. The Party's policies are the weapons for the masses to carry out the revolution and are to mobilize the masses to the greatest extent and isolate the enemy to the greatest extent. In the movement, we must firmly rely on the revolutionary left, strive to unite the majority of the masses. We must adopt an attitude of concrete analysis and differentiation towards people and things. Our targets for attack are limited to a handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist, and counter-revolutionary bad elements. For the numerous intellectuals with bourgeois worldviews and cadres who have made general mistakes, we should give appropriate criticism and adopt the policy of unity, education, and reform. We must adhere to the Party's class line and must base ourselves on workers, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants. It is wrong to have no class analysis. First, there must be class analysis, and second, we must not rely solely on class origin. For children of the exploiting classes, we implement the policy of emphasizing performance. Emphasizing performance mainly looks at political performance, that is, whether they have drawn a clear line with the exploiting classes, their attitude towards the Party's leadership, socialism, Mao Zedong Thought, their ideological reform, and the Cultural Revolution. The former Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China seriously distorted the Party's policy of emphasizing performance. They only talked about performance, not class origin, and only looked at professional performance, not political performance. This stripped the policy of emphasizing performance of its class content and revolutionary soul, which was actually a revisionist class line.

The meeting pointed out that the youth league organization should do the following in the Cultural Revolution:

1. Consistently place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all youth league work. Chairman Mao is the supreme commander of the Cultural Revolution, and Mao Zedong Thought is the supreme guiding ideology of the Cultural Revolution. Only by arming the youth with the greatest revolutionary truth of our time—Mao Zedong Thought—can we have the firmest stance, the greatest courage, and the most correct strategies and tactics, and enable the youth to withstand the severe tests of class struggle. Therefore, the Communist Youth League organization must, at every stage and step of the movement, consistently grasp the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. We must adhere to the principle proposed by Comrade Lin Biao: "Study with questions in mind, apply actively, integrate study and use, learn urgently what is needed urgently, and see immediate results." We must study in the struggle and use in the struggle, and focus on the "use."

2. Mobilize the youth, educate them seriously, and raise their revolutionary enthusiasm to the level of the Party's policies, so that they can more powerfully attack the anti-Party, anti-socialist black gangs under the leadership of the Party. Make them more consciously make revolution, dare to revolutionize, and be good at revolutionizing. Through the tempering of struggle, they can further achieve proletarian revolutionization. Educate the youth to stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint, learn to distinguish and handle two types of contradictions, and learn to distinguish between flowers and weeds. They must not only have great revolutionary daring but also learn the strategies of defeating the enemy.

3. In conjunction with the movement, rectify the youth league organization and fully play the fighting role of the youth league organization.

The leaders of the youth league at all levels must enthusiastically support the revolutionary mass movement, go to the revolutionary masses, go to the revolutionary storm, receive education, and undergo tempering.

4. Use Mao Zedong Thought to educate young children. Make young children read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions from a young age, becoming good children of Chairman Mao. Conduct Cultural Revolution education among young children and launch an educational campaign of "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" among young children.

    共青团北京市委召开改组后第一次委员扩大会议强调指出
    组织青少年活学活用毛主席著作是共青团最高任务
    共青团组织要站在文化大革命的前列发挥突击作用
    李雪峰同志到会作了重要报告　胡克实同志作了重要讲话
    新华社二十六日讯  共青团北京市委从七月三日至十一日，召开了改组后的第一次委员扩大会议。会议一致通过了《让毛泽东思想伟大红旗永远飘扬在首都青年工作的阵地上》的决议。会议号召全市共青团员和革命青年，用毛泽东思想武装起来，把毛主席的书当作一切行动的最高指示，坚定地拥护党的领导，忠实地执行党的政策，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    这次会议，是在中共北京市委和共青团中央的直接领导下召开的。这是首都青年运动中一次具有历史意义的会议。中共中央华北局第一书记、中共北京市委第一书记李雪峰同志作了重要报告。团中央书记处书记胡克实同志作了重要讲话。
    会议对前团北京市委竭力推行前中共北京市委修正主义路线的罪行，进行了揭发和批判，着重讨论了首都团组织如何带领广大团员和青年，站到无产阶级文化大革命的前列，自觉地经受这场阶级斗争的锻炼，发挥共青团的突击作用。到会同志一致认为：首都的无产阶级文化大革命的形势好得很，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，掀起了一个新的高潮。广大革命青年是文化大革命的闯将，他们发扬革命的大无畏精神，冲锋陷阵，锐不可当。他们在运动中经风雨，见世面，提高了阶级觉悟，受到了最深刻的教育和最实际的锻炼。到会同志进一步体会到文化大革命是一场尖锐、复杂、激烈的阶级斗争，是一场反对资本主义复辟，反对反革命政变，反对修正主义集团篡夺领导权的斗争。
    会议认为，这场文化大革命，是青年活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂，是培养无产阶级革命接班人的大熔炉。从某种意义上说，文化大革命就是一场无产阶级与资产阶级争夺青年一代的斗争，也是老一辈革命者带领青年一代闹革命。在社会主义时期，阶级敌人向我们进攻，往往把矛头指向两个方面，一是千方百计地同无产阶级争夺各个领域的领导权，一是千方百计地同无产阶级争夺青年一代。争夺青年的斗争，是整个社会主义时期阶级斗争的一个重要的组成部分。共青团组织是当党的有力助手，引导青年跟着毛主席走，还是沦为资产阶级野心家的走卒，让青年跟着修正主义分子走，这是社会主义时期青年工作的两条道路的斗争。我们要从前团市委的蜕化变质，吸取深刻的教训。
    会议强调指出，从文化大革命这场阶级斗争的大考验中，得出一条根本经验：要想在政治风浪中不迷失方向，就要真正学好毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是我们的政治方向，是我们一切行动的最高指示。只要我们掌握了毛泽东思想这一最强大的思想武器，就能够分清敌我，站稳立场，明辨是非，永远立于不败之地。
    会议认为，对毛泽东思想采取什么态度，是革命、反革命，真革命、假革命的分水岭。是革命者，就一定拥护毛泽东思想，按毛泽东思想办事，对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰，无限崇拜。前共青团北京市委的主要负责人，在青年工作中推行了一条修正主义路线，他们竭力反对和破坏青少年活学活用毛主席著作的运动。他们宣扬什么“自愿参加、自由结合、自定时间、自选内容”的口号，实际上是放任自流，取消主义，是资产阶级自由化的口号。这使北京市一些团的干部和青年，在思想上解除了武装，政治上迷失了方向。有些人之所以不辨真假，盲目执行修正主义路线，成了政治上的糊涂虫，当了修正主义的传声筒，教训千条万条，最根本的一条就是没有认真活学活用毛主席著作，没有掌握毛泽东思想这个政治上的望远镜和显微镜。
    为此，会议强调指出，共青团最高的任务、最大的政治，就是要发动、组织和带领广大青少年活学活用毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想，来提高青年反复辟、反颠覆、反和平演变的本领，学会批判形形色色资产阶级“权威”、“祖师爷”、代表人物的本领。在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，培养锻炼无产阶级革命接班人，彻底挖掉修正主义的根子，深深扎下毛泽东思想的根子。会议决定：一定要把组织青年活学活用、大学大用毛主席著作，当作新团市委成立后的头一件大事，当作区别于前团市委修正主义领导的最根本的标志。
    会议强调指出：放手发动群众，用群众运动的方法，进行无产阶级文化大革命，这是党和毛主席的伟大的创举。我们要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，任何时候都要相信党，都要相信群众。把党的领导和千百万青年群众的革命行动结合起来。
    在文化大革命中，团组织要坚决实行民主集中制，彻底走群众路线。害怕群众就不是真正的革命者，打击革命左派，就是反革命行为。我们要懂得，没有民主，就不可能有正确的集中。没有高度的民主，就没有高度的集中。集中不是给群众运动规定清规戒律，而是要集中群众的正确意见，使群众运动在党的领导下更加生动活泼、更加波澜壮阔地发展。
    为了更好地发动青年群众，必须把党的政策交给群众。党的政策是群众进行革命的武器，是为了最大限度地把群众发动起来，最大限度地把敌人孤立起来。在运动中，要坚定地依靠革命左派，争取团结群众的大多数。我们对人对事都要采取具体分析，区别对待的态度。我们打击的对象只限于一小撮反党、反社会主义、反革命的坏人。对于数量众多的抱有资产阶级世界观的知识分子，对于犯有一般性错误的干部，应当给予适当批评，采取团结、教育和改造的方针。我们必须坚持党的阶级路线，必须以工人、贫农下中农为基础，无成份论是不对的。第一是有成份论，第二是不要唯成份论。对于剥削阶级子女，实行重在表现的政策。重在表现，主要是看政治表现，即看他是否和剥削阶级划清了界限，看他对党的领导，对社会主义，对毛泽东思想，对自己的思想改造，对文化大革命采取什么态度。前中共北京市委严重地歪曲了党的重在表现政策，他们只讲表现，不讲成份，只看业务表现，不看政治表现，这就把重在表现政策的阶级内容和革命灵魂抽掉了，实际上是修正主义的阶级路线。
    会议指出，团组织要在文化大革命运动中做好以下几项工作：
    一、自始至终把活学活用毛主席著作放在团的一切工作的首位。毛主席是文化大革命的最高统帅，毛泽东思想是文化大革命的最高指导思想。只有用当代最伟大的革命真理——毛泽东思想武装青年头脑，才能有最坚定的立场，最大的勇敢，最正确的战略战术，才能使青年经受住阶级斗争风浪的严峻考验。因此，共青团组织要在运动的每个阶段、每个步骤上，自始至终紧紧抓住活学活用毛主席著作。要坚持林彪同志提出的“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”的原则，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    二、放手发动青年，认真教育青年，把青年的革命热情，提高到党的政策水平上来，更有力地向反党反社会主义的黑帮开火。使他们在党的领导下，更加自觉地闹革命，敢于革命、善于革命，通过斗争的锻炼，进一步实现无产阶级革命化。要教育青年站稳无产阶级立场，学会区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，学会辨别香花和毒草。不仅要有大无畏的革命胆略，而且要学会克敌制胜的斗争策略。
    三、结合运动，整顿团的组织，充分发挥团组织的战斗作用。
    团的各级领导干部，要满腔热情地支持革命的群众运动，到革命群众中去，到革命风暴中去，接受教育，经受锻炼。
    四、用毛泽东思想教育少年儿童。使少年儿童从小就读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好孩子。在少年儿童中进行文化大革命的教育，在少年儿童中开展一个“毛泽东思想万万岁”的教育活动。
