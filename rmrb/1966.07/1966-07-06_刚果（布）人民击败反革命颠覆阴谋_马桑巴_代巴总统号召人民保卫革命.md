The people of the capital of Congo (Brazzaville) held a rally at "Liberty Square" on July 3 to celebrate the second anniversary of the founding of the ruling party, the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville). The leaders of Congo (Brazzaville) condemned the recent coup plot by counter-revolutionary elements at the rally and called on the people to defend the revolution.

The leaders of Congo (Brazzaville), including President Massamba-Debat, who had just returned from abroad, Prime Minister N'Gouabi, and the leadership of the ruling party's Political Bureau and the government, also attended the rally.

President Massamba-Debat, in his speech at the mass rally, condemned the counter-revolutionary disturbances. He called on the people to remain vigilant. He said, "The important thing is not weapons, not materials, but people."

The coup plot defeated by the people of Congo (Brazzaville) took place a week earlier. On June 27, more than a hundred members of the Kouyou tribe, under the instigation of imperialism, attacked the office of the Political Bureau of the ruling party, the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville). A few counter-revolutionary elements in the army also took the opportunity to cause trouble.

Prime Minister N'Gouabi made two speeches on June 28, one in the afternoon and one in the evening. He demanded that all military personnel restore order, called on the people to double their vigilance, strengthen the unity of the revolutionary ranks, and obey the orders of the party and the government. He also appointed a new commander-in-chief of the National People's Army, Captain Ebadepe, and Chief of Staff, Lieutenant Kimbouala. The leaders of the government and the ruling party gathered at a sports field on the outskirts of the city, from where they mobilized the masses, led, and directed the struggle to defend the revolution.

Due to the support of the militia, the broad masses of the people, and patriotic soldiers, the ruling party and the government controlled the situation, and the capital, Brazzaville, has returned to normal. The prime minister and the cabinet ministers have resumed work in their offices.

    刚果（布）人民击败反革命颠覆阴谋
    马桑巴—代巴总统号召人民保卫革命
    据新华社布拉柴维尔四日电　刚果（布）首都人民三日在“自由广场”举行大会，庆祝执政党刚果（布）全国革命运动成立两周年。刚果（布）领导人在会上谴责反革命分子最近策划的政变阴谋，并且号召人民保卫革命。
    刚刚从国外回国的马桑巴—代巴总统以及总理努马扎莱、执政党政治局和政府的领导人也参加了大会。
    马桑巴—代巴总统在群众大会上讲话时，谴责了反革命骚乱。他号召人民保持警惕。他说，重要的不是武器，不是物资，而是人。
    被刚果（布）人民击败的颠覆阴谋发生在一星期以前。六月二十七日，在帝国主义阴谋策划下，一百多名库尤部族人袭击了执政党刚果（布）全国革命运动政治局办公处，军队中的少数反革命分子也乘机闹事。
    刚果（布）总理努马扎莱在六月二十八日中午和晚上先后发表了两次讲话。他要求所有军队恢复秩序，号召人民加倍警惕，加强革命队伍的团结，服从党和政府的命令。他还任命了新的国家人民军总司令埃巴德佩上尉和参谋长金布瓦拉中尉。政府和执政党的领导人聚集在市郊的一个体育场，从那里动员群众，领导和指挥保卫革命的斗争。
    由于民卫队和广大人民以及爱国军人的支持，执政党和政府控制了局势，首都布拉柴维尔已恢复正常。总理和内阁部长们已恢复在他们的办公室里工作。
