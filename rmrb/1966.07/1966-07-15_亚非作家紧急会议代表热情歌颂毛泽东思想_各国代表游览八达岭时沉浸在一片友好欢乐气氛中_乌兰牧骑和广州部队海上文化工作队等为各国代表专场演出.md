The Great Wall's Badaling was filled with the joyous laughter and friendly chatter of representatives from various countries attending the Asia-Africa Writers' Emergency Conference today.

After getting off the bus at Badaling, the representatives from various countries eagerly climbed up the Great Wall despite the scorching summer sun. At this moment, some foreign friends passionately recited Chairman Mao's poem "Sixiang Mountain": "One is not a true hero until one has been to the Great Wall..." Others repeatedly exclaimed, "It's so magnificent!" "The Great Wall is a historical symbol of the diligence and bravery of the Chinese people!"

Tanzanian representative Muhammad Ali Hamidi climbed to the highest point of Badaling in one breath. Looking at the lush green mountains, he couldn't help but say excitedly, "China has a great people and such magnificent scenery. I long for the Great Wall and love the Chinese people even more. The friendship between the Tanzanian people and the Chinese people is as solid as a bond. Coming to China and the Great Wall, I deeply feel that people united can overcome all enemies; I have also seen the great power of Mao Zedong Thought, which changes people's minds." Hamidi also said deeply, "My life has passed uneventfully for thirty-nine years, but when I turned forty, I came to China and found a pearl, which is Mao Zedong Thought. It helps me distinguish right from wrong, good from bad."

Zimbabwean representative Mombeshora quickly reached the top and excitedly sang "The East Is Red." He said that singing "The East Is Red" gave him more strength and courage to climb the peak. He also told his Chinese friend climbing beside him that he would definitely bring this song praising Chairman Mao to the people of Zimbabwe who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism. Along the way, he enthusiastically shouted, "Long live the friendship between the people of Zimbabwe and China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Here, friends from dozens of countries in Asia and Africa were completely immersed in a friendly and joyful atmosphere.

In the evening, the China Railway Art Troupe and Acrobatics Troupe performed wonderful acrobatic acts for the representatives from various countries. After the performance, the performers held up banners reading "Long live the unity of the Asian and African peoples!" "Long live the unity of Asian and African writers against imperialism!" and sang "The Internationale" to warmly greet the Asian and African friends.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 13th, the Ulanqab Cultural Troupe and the Guangzhou Military District's Maritime Cultural Work Team, who came to Beijing specially from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Guangdong Province, performed a special show for the representatives attending the Asia-Africa Writers' Emergency Conference this evening.

The Ulanqab Cultural Troupe sang self-composed songs to celebrate the success of the Asia-Africa Writers' Emergency Conference. The Maritime Cultural Work Team performed "The Song of Unity and Struggle of Asian and African Writers" and "Fishing Boats on the Gulf of Tonkin," reflecting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, which were warmly received. The performers of the Maritime Cultural Work Team sang loudly, "Asia and Africa, revolutionary comrades, unite and join the fiery battle. Let our pens be bayonets, support the Vietnamese people, defeat the American bandits, and eliminate their running dogs." At this moment, the entire venue erupted in applause. The two performing teams also performed many programs reflecting the herdsmen's and soldiers' love for Chairman Mao. The songs "We Sing of Mao Zedong" and "The Herdsmen's Hearts Are Connected with Mao Zedong Thought" and the short song and dance "Herdsmen Love to Read Chairman Mao's Books" reflected the pure feelings of respect and love for the great leader Mao Zedong among the soldiers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups.

After the performance, the representatives from various countries presented flower baskets to the performers, thanking the performing teams for bringing friendship to the Asian and African peoples from afar.

    据新华社十四日讯　古长城上的八达岭，因为出席亚非作家紧急会议的各国代表来到这里游览，今天处处回响着友谊的欢声笑语。
    各国作家代表在八达岭下车以后，便兴致勃勃地冒着盛夏骄阳，向长城的高处攀登。这时候，有的外国朋友满怀激情地朗诵起毛主席《六盘山》中的诗句：“不到长城非好汉……。”有的还不断赞叹说：“太雄伟了！”“长城是中国人民勤劳、勇敢的历史象征！”
    坦桑尼亚代表穆罕默德·阿里·赫迈迪一股作气地登上八达岭的最高峰，他眺望那郁郁葱葱的群山，禁不住高兴地说：“中国有很好的人民，有如此壮丽的风光。我向往长城，更爱中国人民，坦桑尼亚人民和中国人民的友谊象用纽带系起来一样的巩固。我来到中国，来到长城，深深感到人民团结起来，可以战胜一切敌人；我更看到了毛泽东思想的巨大力量，它改变了人的思想。”赫迈迪还深有感触地说：“我的生命已度过了平淡的三十九年，但是我在四十岁的时候来到中国，找到了珍珠，这就是毛泽东思想，它使我分清了正确与错误，好和坏。”
    津巴布韦代表蒙贝肖拉快登上顶峰时，兴奋地唱起了《东方红》。他说，一唱《东方红》，他就增添了力量，更有勇气攀登顶峰。他还向并肩同他攀登的中国朋友说，他一定要把这首歌颂领袖毛主席的歌曲，带给正在为反对帝国主义和殖民主义而战斗的津巴布韦人民。一路上，他激动地欢呼：“津巴布韦人民和中国人民友好万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    在这里，来自亚洲、非洲几十个国家的朋友完全沉浸在一片友好和欢乐的气氛中。
    晚上，中国铁路文工团杂技团为各国代表们表演了精采的杂技节目。演出结束后，演员们高举写着“亚非人民大团结万岁”、“亚非作家反帝团结万岁”的标语，齐唱《全世界人民团结起来》的歌曲，向亚非朋友们热烈致意。
    据新华社十三日讯　专程从内蒙古自治区和广东省来北京的乌兰牧骑和广州部队海上文化工作队，今晚为出席亚非作家紧急会议的代表作了专场演出。
    乌兰牧骑为祝贺亚非作家紧急会议的成功，演唱了自编的歌曲。海上文化工作队编演了《亚非作家团结战斗之歌》，以及反映越南人民抗美救国斗争的《下龙湾上打渔船》，受到了热烈的欢迎。海上文化工作队演员们纵声高唱：“亚洲非洲，革命的战友，团结起来，投入火热的战斗。把我们的笔尖当作刺刀，支援越南人民，打倒美国强盗，消灭它的帮凶走狗。”这时，全场响起了热烈的掌声。两个演出队还演出了不少反映牧民和解放军战士热爱毛主席的节目。《听我们歌唱毛泽东》、《牧民的心和毛泽东思想紧相连》这两首歌曲，以及小歌舞《牧民爱读毛主席的书》，反映了战士和牧民对各族人民伟大领袖毛主席无限崇敬、无限热爱的纯朴感情。
    演出结束后，各国代表向演员们献了花篮，感谢演出队远道送来的对亚非人民的友情。
