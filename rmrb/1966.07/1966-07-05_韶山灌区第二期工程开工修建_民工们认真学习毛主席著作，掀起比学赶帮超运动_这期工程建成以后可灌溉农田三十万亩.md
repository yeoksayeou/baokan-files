On July 1, the 45th anniversary of the founding of our great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, the Shaoshan Irrigation Project Command Department held a grand opening ceremony in Shitan Town, Xiangtan County, to announce the start of construction on the South Branch Canal of the Shaoshan Irrigation Project.

The South Branch Canal, stretching 132 kilometers, is a crucial component of the Shaoshan Irrigation Project. Once completed, it will irrigate 300,000 mu of farmland along the south bank of the Lian River in Xiangxiang and Xiangtan counties, transforming these fields.

At the opening ceremony, CCP Lake South Province Committee member and Vice Governor of Hunan Province, Shang Zijing, delivered a speech. He emphasized: "The main canal and the North Branch Canal of the Shaoshan Irrigation Project have recently been completed, and now the South Branch Canal is starting construction. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a powerful response to the anti-party, anti-socialist clique. We have the experience of building the main canal and the North Branch Canal, and we will build the South Branch Canal even better. We must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, using Mao Zedong Thought as our guide to build the entire project. This requires pushing the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, transforming our worldview, and achieving both spiritual and material abundance. With the Party's leadership, a revolutionary construction team, and the support of the people of the entire province, the South Branch Canal will definitely be successfully built, and we will win another great victory."

Representatives of the workers, including "Five Good" workers Zheng Dagui and Ye Renfu, and staff representative Jin Xuesheng, also spoke at the meeting. They expressed the wishes of all workers and staff: to seriously read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, without seeking fame or personal gain, fearing no hardship, and dedicating themselves to the revolution and the people, to build the South Branch Canal for the revolution.

The main canal and the North Branch Canal of the Shaoshan Irrigation Project began construction on July 1 last year and were completed in just ten months, with water flowing through on June 2 this year. The South Branch Canal now under construction will pass through an 800-meter-long tunnel and build three crossings totaling 600 meters in length, with approximately 5 million cubic meters of earth and stone to be moved. The project remains challenging. The command department plans to complete the earth and stone work and construction tasks by the end of this year, leaving part of the workforce to finish up, aiming to complete the project before the Spring Festival of 1967, so that it can irrigate the farmland during the spring plowing season.

The workers constructing this phase of the project arrived at the site in mid-June. Many work teams have established study groups for Chairman Mao's works and set up study systems, carrying Chairman Mao's books with them and studying whenever they have time. They have repeatedly studied articles such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." In the construction of the project, the workers have paid attention to high standards and quality from the beginning, launching a movement of learning from each other, catching up, helping, and surpassing.

    韶山灌区第二期工程开工修建
    民工们认真学习毛主席著作，掀起比学赶帮超运动  这期工程建成以后可灌溉农田三十万亩
    新华社长沙三日电七月一日，正当我们伟大的光荣的正确的中国共产党成立四十五周年的时候，湖南省韶山灌区工程指挥部在湘潭县石潭镇隆重举行了第二期工程开工典礼，宣布韶山灌区南干渠正式开工修建。
    南干渠长一百三十二公里，是韶山灌区工程一个重要组成部分。它修建成功，可以灌溉湘乡、湘潭两县涟水南岸一带三十万亩农田，使这些农田改变面貌。
    中共湖南省委委员。湖南省副省长尚子锦在开工典礼上讲了话。他指出：韶山灌区的总干渠、北干渠竣工不久，今天南干渠又开工了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是对反党反社会主义黑帮的一个有力的回击。我们有了修建总干渠、北干渠的丰富经验，要把南干渠修得比北干渠还好。我们要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，以毛泽东思想为统帅，来修建整个工程。这就要把学习毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，改造我们的世界观，达到“修好渠道炼好人，精神物质双丰收”的目的。我们有党的领导，有革命化的施工队伍，有全省人民的支援，南干渠一定能够修好，再打一个大胜仗。
    民工代表、“五好”民工郑达贵、叶仁富，职工代表金学胜也在会上发言。他们表达了全体民工、职工的心愿：认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，不图名，不图利，不怕苦，一心为革命，一心为人民，为革命修好南干渠。
    韶山灌区总干渠和北干渠工程，是去年七月一日举行开工典礼的，以十个月的时间就修成了，在今年六月二日正式通水。现在动工修建的南干渠，要穿过一处八百多米长的隧洞，要架搭三处共达六百多米长的渡槽，土石方共约五百万方，工程仍是比较艰巨的。工程指挥部计划在今年十二月基本完成土石方和工程建筑任务；然后留下部分人力扫尾，力争一九六七年春节前竣工，春耕时灌溉农田。
    修建这期工程的民工，在六月中旬就上了工地。许多民工连队成立了学习毛主席著作辅导小组，建立了学习制度，毛主席的书随身带，有空就学。他们反复学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等文章。在工程建设上，民工们一开始就注意了高标准、高质量，掀起比学赶帮超运动。
