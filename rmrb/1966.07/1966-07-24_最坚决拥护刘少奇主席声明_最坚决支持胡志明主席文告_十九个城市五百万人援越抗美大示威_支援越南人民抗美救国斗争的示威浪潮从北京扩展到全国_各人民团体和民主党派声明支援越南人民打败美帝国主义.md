A wave of protests denouncing U.S. imperialism's escalation of its aggression in Vietnam and supporting the Vietnamese people in their struggle for national liberation to the very end is sweeping from Beijing to the entire country.

Today, more than five million people from nineteen cities took to the streets to hold rallies and demonstrations. Participants expressed their most resolute and fervent support for Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement and Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots." They declared that the Chinese people, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, are fully prepared to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and take necessary actions with the Vietnamese people to jointly strike against the U.S. aggressors.

Cities that held rallies and demonstrations today include Guangzhou, Nanning, Kunming, Shenyang, Harbin, Nanjing, Changchun, Fuzhou, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Urumqi, Changsha, Guiyang, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Lanzhou, Xining, Lhasa, and Haikou in Hainan Island. In some cities, over fifty thousand people participated in the rallies and marches. In Haikou, a city with a population of two hundred thousand, half of the residents took to the streets today. In Lhasa, fifty thousand liberated serfs, militia members, cadre, and PLA soldiers held rallies and demonstrations. In the border areas of Yunnan, people in the Yao Autonomous County of Hekou, Malipo County, and Jinping County also held rallies and demonstrations.

Workers, rural commune members, PLA soldiers, and people from all walks of life in Shanghai, Tianjin, Xi'an, Chengdu, and Wuhan held small-scale rallies to condemn the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism.

The Chinese people have always regarded supporting the just struggles of oppressed nations and peoples around the world against imperialism and its lackeys as a sacred internationalist duty. Supporting the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression is a responsibility that the Chinese people cannot shirk. During the rallies and marches, the masses held high red flags and various banners, shouting slogans such as "The Chinese people are determined to be the rear guard of the Vietnamese people! China is the rear base of Vietnam!" and "Vietnam will win, the U.S. will lose!" with a momentum that shakes the heavens and the earth, expressing their most resolute support for the Vietnamese people.

New China News Agency, July 23rd: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and other people's organizations, as well as the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and other democratic parties, issued statements today expressing their resolute support for Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement and Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots." In their statements, various people's organizations and democratic parties solemnly declared that no matter what the cost, no matter how far U.S. imperialism expands the war, the Chinese people will firmly support the Vietnamese people to the end until they achieve final victory.

The people's organizations that issued statements today are: the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament, and the Chinese People's Association for Afro-Asian Solidarity. Additionally, the China-Vietnam Friendship Association sent a letter to Ambassador Chen Ziping of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam yesterday, expressing resolute support for the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, and the China Democratic National Construction Association also issued statements today. They declared in their statements that they will henceforth unite more closely around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, together with the people of the entire country, to be the rear guard of the Vietnamese people and fight to the end with the common enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism.
