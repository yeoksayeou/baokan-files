    The Hubei "Yi Hong" tea region has achieved a bumper harvest of spring tea. The main tea-producing regions of Yichang and Enshi Prefectures have increased production by more than 20 percent compared to last year.

    This spring, the low-temperature period was longer than last year, which was not conducive to the growth of tea trees. However, due to the tea-growing community's establishment of the idea of growing tea for the revolution, they fully exerted their subjective initiative. They universally carried out soil mounding, pruning, and fertilizing for the tea trees, and the harvesting period was about ten days earlier than last year.

    Currently, the broad masses of cadres and community members in the "Yi Hong" tea region are summarizing the experience of spring tea increase, studying measures to increase summer and autumn tea production, and striving for a bumper harvest of tea throughout the year.

    湖北“宜红”春茶获得丰收
    湖北“宜红”茶区春茶获得丰收。主要产茶区宜昌、恩施两专区今年春茶比去年增产二成以上。
    今年春季低温时间比去年长，对茶树生长不利。但由于茶区社员树立了种茶为革命的思想，充分发挥了主观能动作用，对茶树普遍进行了壅土培蔸、剪枝亮蔸、追施春肥，采摘期还比去年提前十天左右。
    目前，“宜红”茶区的广大干部和社员，正在总结春茶增产经验，研究夏茶、秋茶增产措施，力争全年茶叶大丰收。  （据新华社讯）
