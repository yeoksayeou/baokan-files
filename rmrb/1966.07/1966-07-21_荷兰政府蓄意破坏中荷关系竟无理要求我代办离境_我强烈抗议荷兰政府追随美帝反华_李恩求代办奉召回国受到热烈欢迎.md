The Dutch government has intentionally sabotaged Sino-Dutch relations and irrationally demanded that our envoy leave. We strongly protest the Dutch government's actions in following the U.S. imperialists in their anti-China activities. Li Enqiu, our envoy, returns to the country and is warmly welcomed.

	BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) — On July 19, Assistant Minister of the Western European Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, Xie Li, summoned the Dutch Charge d'Affaires in China, Yang Keren, to lodge a strong protest against the Dutch government's arbitrary and unreasonable announcement on July 19, 1966, that our envoy to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Li Enqiu, was an "unwelcome person" and demanded that he leave within 24 hours. Xie Li pointed out that this was a serious incident in which the Dutch government actively followed the U.S. imperialists in their anti-China activities and intentionally sabotaged Sino-Dutch relations. The Dutch government must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences arising from this action.

	BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) — Today, our envoy to the Netherlands, Li Enqiu, and his wife arrived in Beijing. They were warmly welcomed and comforted at the airport by Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Han Nianlong; Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, Lei Renmin; Vice Chairman of the Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee, Ding Xilin; and representatives from various departments in the capital. Young women presented them with flowers.

	Li Enqiu, the envoy, was recalled to China by the Chinese government after the Dutch government arbitrarily and unreasonably declared him an "unwelcome person."
