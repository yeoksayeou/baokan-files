Editor's Note: The Party branch of Gu Feng Production Brigade mobilized the peasant masses to study Chairman Mao's works, especially Mao's instructions on rural work, to summarize the historical experience since land reform, and conducted a lively and vibrant mass self-education. This approach is very commendable.

The broad masses of peasants have personally experienced the deep suffering of the old society and have also personally experienced the great revolution that has transformed the countryside since land reform. They have a deep affection and intimate understanding of the revolutionary truths spoken by Chairman Mao. They draw conclusions from their own practical experience: "At any time, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words." By listening to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely taking the socialist path, people's consciousness will be raised, and the collective economy will prosper.

The responsibility of party organizations at all levels in the countryside is to guide the broad masses of peasants to use various lively and practical methods to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Master the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to better transform the subjective and objective worlds, and advance along the broad and smooth path of socialism.

Recently, the Party branch of Gu Feng Production Brigade in Cangwu County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, carried out a mass activity to summarize historical experience according to Chairman Mao's teachings since land reform, further enhancing the self-awareness of Party members and the masses in studying Chairman Mao's works.

The activity of summarizing historical experience developed on the basis of studying Chairman Mao's works. The method was: first, organize the brigade cadres and Party members to list the major events that the entire brigade has experienced since the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and compare them with the relevant teachings in Chairman Mao's works to see which events were done correctly by following Chairman Mao's words. From the comparison, they raised their understanding of the great significance of reading Chairman Mao's books and acting according to his instructions. After the brigade-level summary, the production teams followed the brigade's summary approach, using examples from each village and team to conduct similar summaries. In the summary, Party members and the masses were encouraged to share their personal experiences and insights.

This summary was conducted in a lively and vibrant manner. In essence, it was Party members and the masses recounting their journey of uprising, revolution, and collective path under Chairman Mao's leadership. Everyone, young and old, had something to say. When talking about things done correctly, they were full of joy; when talking about mistakes, they had many regrets. Everyone spoke from their own personal experiences and genuine feelings. They used Chairman Mao's teachings as a standard to measure their past and the history of their village and team.

At the brigade Party members' meeting, everyone enthusiastically summarized several major events since the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Gu Feng Production Brigade. These major events are:

First: After the land reform, Chairman Mao called on peasants to organize and cooperate mutually, taking the path of collectivization. The Party members of Gu Feng Production Brigade, following Chairman Mao's words, took the lead in organizing mutual aid teams. At that time, a peasant with a strong capitalist tendency insisted on individual farming and said he would compete with the mutual aid team to make it collapse. When the drought came, the mutual aid team collectively used water wheels to irrigate the fields and quickly overcame the drought. However, he and his wife took turns operating a water wheel, working so hard that they didn't have time to eat. The result? Reduced production, admitted defeat, and requested to join the team.

Second: On the basis of mutual aid teams, following the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the entire brigade established five primary cooperatives. Later, as production developed, the problem of small cooperatives with weak leadership emerged. At this time, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao again instructed everyone to gradually expand and merge cooperatives, and upgrade them. Most of the masses, following Chairman Mao's words, established advanced cooperatives. Indeed, the leadership was strengthened. That year, grain production was abundant, and the cooperative members had more grain than they could eat, and they voluntarily sold surplus grain.

Third: The advanced cooperatives were successful because Chairman Mao boosted the spirit of poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao taught everyone to "establish the dominance of the poor peasants," saying, "The poor will rise," and "the chickens will indeed fly to the sky." Chairman Mao's instruction greatly inspired the poor and lower-middle peasants. At that time, Gao Village and Dangshang engaged in production competitions, with poor and lower-middle peasants taking the lead, going to the county seat to carry fertilizer at four in the morning. In Dangxia, a wealthy peasant sat on a camphor root, fanning himself, and when he saw cooperative members carrying fertilizer passing by, he deliberately shouted about the heat, mocking the advanced cooperative for working hard. However, everyone remained undeterred, and by the end of the year, they increased production by 20%. The entire township, except for two households, all joined the cooperative.

Fourth: Following Chairman Mao's instructions, large-scale water conservancy projects were undertaken. In the annotations of "The Socialist High Tide in China's Countryside," Chairman Mao repeatedly proposed to develop water conservancy, saying: "Developing water conservancy is a major task to ensure agricultural increase. Small-scale water conservancy can be undertaken by every county, district, township, and cooperative. ... On the basis of cooperativization, the masses have great strength. The ordinary problems of floods and droughts that have not been solved for thousands of years may be solved within a few years." Gu Feng Production Brigade spent two years to build the Saiding Reservoir, Malan Reservoir, and Gu Feng Canal, completely eliminating the threat of "drought killing An Village and floods killing Ge Village." Now, the worries of drought and floods have been largely eliminated. At that time, some people did not allow the canal to be opened, saying it would damage the feng shui, and they said they were planning for their descendants. Now, these have all become jokes.

Fifth: Chairman Mao told everyone to be practical and seek truth from facts. In recent years, whatever was done according to these words was done very well. Everyone gained rich experience and decided to listen to Chairman Mao's words even more.

Sixth: Chairman Mao told everyone that there are still classes and class struggles in socialist society. The socialist education movement proved that those who remember Chairman Mao's instruction can adhere to the socialist path; while those who forget class struggle will make mistakes.

Seventh: Chairman Mao said: "If mistakes are made, they should be corrected, and the faster and more thoroughly they are corrected, the better." Some cadres who made mistakes decided to listen to Chairman Mao's words, correct their mistakes, and made rapid progress. The current production team leader of the second team in Gu Feng Production Brigade made mistakes in the past. Later, he decided to study Chairman Mao's works and act according to his instructions. The production team he led became a model for the entire brigade and was praised by the masses.

Eighth: Recently, the cadres and members of Gu Feng Production Brigade have learned from the experiences and lessons of these years and firmly remembered Chairman Mao's instruction: politics is the commander, the soul. They emphasized politics in their work. Furthermore, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "the basic task of political work is to constantly instill socialist ideas in the peasant masses and criticize capitalist tendencies," they launched a "break private, establish public" ideological revolution. The entire brigade's production progress is fast and the quality is high. Now, the brigade is gradually realizing agricultural mechanization with the spirit of self-reliance. The masses say: "We have been waiting for many years, and now we have finally waited for this day!" The production enthusiasm is even higher.

Throughout the brigade, after several such summaries, the masses' feelings run deep. After summarizing the experiences of more than a decade, they condensed it into one sentence: "A thousand branches do not leave the root, a thousand words and a million words are not as clear as this one sentence: At any time, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words." This summary, starting from the masses' life experiences, guided the masses to recognize the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought from their own practical experiences, making everyone more deeply understand that Chairman Mao's instructions are the treasure for uprising and revolution. Therefore, they study more actively, voluntarily establish study systems, and personal self-study gradually forms a trend. The "break private, establish public" ideological revolution is vigorously carried out. The masses' love for the Party and Chairman Mao deepens, and many moving examples appear.

　　毛主席的书是闹翻身干革命的法宝
　　古凤大队总结土改以来的历史经验深刻认识到学习毛主席著作的伟大意义
    编者按：　古凤大队党支部，发动农民群众，对照毛主席著作，特别是毛主席关于农村工作的各项指示，总结土改以来的历史经验，进行了一次生动活泼的群众性的自我教育。他们这种做法，很值得提倡。
    广大农民群众，亲身经历了旧社会深重的苦难，又亲身经历了从土地改革以来农村翻天覆地的大革命，他们对毛主席讲的革命道理，有深厚的感情，有亲切的体会。他们从自己的实践经验中得出结论：“在任何时候都要听毛主席的话。”听毛主席的话，坚决走社会主义道路，人们的觉悟就会提高，集体经济就会兴旺起来。
    农村各级党组织的责任，就是引导广大农民采用各种生动的联系实际的方法，活学活用毛主席著作。掌握毛泽东思想这一锐利武器，以便更好地改造主观世界和客观世界，沿着社会主义的康庄大道，大踏步前进。
    不久前，广西壮族自治区苍梧县古凤大队党支部，开展了群众性的按照毛主席的教导总结土改以来的历史经验的活动，进一步提高了党员、群众学习毛主席著作的自觉性。
    总结历史经验的活动，是在他们学习毛主席著作的基础上发展起来的。做法是：先组织大队骨干和党员把互助合作运动以来全大队经历的重大事情，按照毛主席著作中的有关教导，查一查哪些事情听了毛主席的话，办对了。从对比中来提高对读毛主席的书、照毛主席的指示办事的伟大意义的认识。大队一级总结以后，生产队顺着大队总结的路子，以各村各队的实例，做同样的总结。在总结中，发动党员和群众畅谈自己的亲身经历和体会。
    这次总结进行得十分生动活泼。实际上，这是党员和群众讲述自己在毛主席领导下怎样闹翻身、干革命、走集体化道路的历程。男女老少都有话可说。谈到办对的事，兴高采烈；说到办错的事，感慨很多。大家谈的都是自己的亲身实践，都是发自内心的感受。他们用毛主席的教导作为标尺，衡量自己的过去，衡量本村、本队的历史。
    在大队的党员大会上，大家热烈地总结了古凤大队互助合作运动以来的几件大事。这几件大事是：
    第一件：土地改革后，毛主席号召农民组织起来，互助合作，走集体化道路。古凤大队的党员，听了毛主席的话，带头组织互助组。当时，有个资本主义自发倾向比较严重的农民，坚持单干，还说要跟互助组比赛，把互助组比垮。天旱了，互助组里集体车水灌田，很快战胜了干旱。可是，他两口子轮流踩一架水车，累得饭都顾不上吃。结果呢？减产，认输，要求入组。
    第二件：在互助组的基础上，按照党中央和毛主席的指示，全大队办了五个初级社。以后随着生产的发展，出现了社小、骨干弱的问题。这时，党中央和毛主席又指示大家逐步扩社、并社、升级。多数群众听了毛主席的话，办起了高级社。果然，骨干集中，领导加强了。那一年，粮食获得大丰收，社员分配的谷子吃不完，都自动卖余粮。
    第三件：高级社所以办得好，是因为毛主席长了贫农下中农的志气。毛主席教导大家要“建立贫农优势”，说“穷人要翻身了”，“鸡毛确实要上天了”。毛主席的这个指示，极大地鼓舞了贫农下中农。当时，高村和宕上搞生产竞赛，贫农下中农打先锋，早晨四点钟就去县城担肥。宕下有个富裕农民坐在樟木根上，摇着蒲扇，碰见社员担肥路过，就故意喊热，讥笑高级社做工辛苦。但是大家都不动摇，年底终于增产两成。全乡除两户外都入了社。
    第四件：遵照毛主席的指示，大办水利。毛主席在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》的按语中，一再提出要兴修水利，说：“兴修水利是保证农业增产的大事，小型水利是各县各区各乡和各个合作社都可以办的，……在合作化的基础之上，群众有很大的力量。几千年不能解决的普通的水灾、旱灾问题，可能在几年之内获得解决。”古凤大队花了两年工夫就修起了赛塘水库、马兰水库、古凤水圳，彻底消除了“旱死安垌，浸死蛤垌”的威胁。现在，旱涝两忧大体上解除了。那时，有些人不让开水圳，说是会挖坏了风水，还说他们是为子孙后代打算。现在，这些都成了笑话。
    第五件：毛主席要大家办事实事求是，从实际出发。这几年，凡是照这话办的事，都作得很好。大家得到了丰富的经验，决心更听毛主席的话。
    第六件：毛主席告诉大家，社会主义社会还有阶级和阶级斗争。社会主义教育运动证明，牢记毛主席这个教导的人，就能坚持社会主义道路；而忘记了阶级斗争的人，就会犯错误。
    第七件：毛主席说：“犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”有些犯了错误的干部，决心听毛主席的话，改正错误，进步都很快。古凤大队二队现任的生产队长，过去犯了错误。后来他下决心学习毛主席著作，按照毛主席指示办事，他领导的生产队成了全大队的标兵，受到群众的赞扬。
    第八件：最近古凤大队的干部和社员汲取了这些年的经验教训，牢牢记住毛主席的教导：政治是统帅，是灵魂。他们在工作中突出了政治。并且，按照毛主席所指示的“政治工作的基本任务是向农民群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向”，开展了“破私立公”的思想革命化运动。全大队的生产进度快、质量高。现在，大队正在以自力更生的精神逐步实现农业机械化。群众说：“盼望了多少年，可盼望到这一天了！”生产情绪更高了。
    在全大队，经过多次这样的总结，群众的感受很深。他们把十几年来的经验加以总结之后，归纳成为这样一句话：“千条树丫不离根，千句万句不如这一句明白：在任何时候都要听毛主席的话。”这次总结，是从群众的生活经验出发，引导群众从自己的实践经验去认识毛泽东思想的伟大，使大家更深刻地体会到毛主席的指示是闹翻身、干革命的法宝。因此，他们学习更加主动了，自动地制订了学习制度，个人自学也逐步形成了风气。“破私立公”的思想革命蓬勃开展起来了。群众热爱党、热爱毛主席的感情越来越浓，越来越深，出现了许多动人的事例。
