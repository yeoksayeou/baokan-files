On July 22, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, on behalf of the 700 million people of our country, solemnly declared to the world that we resolutely and enthusiastically support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's July 17 "Letter to All Compatriots." On the same day, a million people in the capital held a mass rally and demonstration. On July 23, 5 million people in 19 cities across our country held rallies and demonstrations. A new wave of support for Vietnam and resistance against the U.S. has swept the country. This once again expresses the iron will and firm resolve of the Chinese people to support their Vietnamese brothers.

The U.S. imperialists' outrageous bombing of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the second-largest city, Haiphong, has escalated the war of aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious stage.

The U.S. imperialists are the most ferocious, most barbaric, and most cunning imperialists in the world, a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. When they suffer continuous defeats in their aggression against Vietnam, they on the one hand frantically escalate the war and engage in war blackmail; on the other hand, they drag out the Geneva Agreement, which they have already torn to shreds, to spread the smoke screen of "peace talks" and throw out bait to lure people in. The U.S. imperialists attempt to use this to deceive world opinion, to tie the hands of the Vietnamese people in their war of resistance against the U.S. and to save the nation, and to tie the hands of the Chinese people and the peoples of other countries in their support for the Vietnamese people.

This is a big deception and a big plot by the U.S. imperialists, and it must be thoroughly exposed.

The U.S. imperialists clutching at this straw will not save their lives. The Geneva Agreement no longer exists. The one who tore the Geneva Agreement to shreds is none other than the U.S. imperialists themselves.

Twelve years ago, when the first Geneva Conference reached an agreement, the U.S. imperialists refused to sign it. They quickly replaced the French colonialists in South Vietnam, creating a puppet government completely controlled by the United States. The restrictions and boundaries set by the Geneva Agreement were actually broken at that time.

Not long after, the U.S. imperialists started an aggressive war in South Vietnam, brutally massacring tens of thousands of Vietnamese people, completely destroying the Geneva Agreement.

Since 1964, the U.S. imperialists have extended the war of aggression from South Vietnam to North Vietnam. This further broke the boundary between South and North Vietnam.

Recently, the U.S. imperialists, disregarding the repeated warnings of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary peoples of the world, brazenly bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This has completely nullified all the restrictions and boundaries set by the Geneva Agreement.

The facts are clear: the Geneva Agreement was torn up by the United States, and the boundaries of the war were broken by the United States. Under these circumstances, the 31 million Vietnamese people have the sacred right to take all measures to wage a war of resistance against the U.S. and to save the nation, and they are no longer bound by any restrictions or boundaries.

The Chinese people have always believed that a negotiating table will not bring independence and freedom to oppressed nations; an international agreement will not guarantee the liberation and happiness of oppressed nations. The U.S. imperialists' expansion of aggression has already reduced the Geneva Agreement to ashes. Under these circumstances, the support and assistance of the Chinese people and the revolutionary peoples of the world to the Vietnamese people, of course, are no longer subject to any restrictions or constraints.

Recently, the Johnson administration has been loudly proclaiming that the United States is prepared to resolve the Vietnam problem on the basis of the "Geneva Agreement." The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, staged a "bomb and negotiate" farce. Indira Gandhi of India, Harold Wilson of Britain, Eisaku Sato of Japan, and Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia have all taken the stage.

What roles have these people played and what functions have they performed in the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary two-pronged policy? The Vietnamese People's Daily said well: "Those who act according to the wishes of the United States have not made any contribution to the resolution of the Vietnam problem; on the contrary, they have made the problem more complicated, and their actions can only serve as the accomplices of the bandits."

We have always condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership clique for pushing nationalism and national selfishness. Their so-called aid to Vietnam is completely false, with ulterior motives, aimed at bringing the Vietnam problem into the track of "Sino-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world." They are the number one accomplices of U.S. imperialism, and traitors who betray the interests of the Vietnamese people.

China is a socialist country armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Proletarian internationalism is the highest guiding principle of our foreign policy. To support the Vietnamese people in thoroughly defeating the U.S. aggressors, we are prepared to make the greatest national sacrifices. The Chinese people have made up their minds and made all preparations to take whatever actions the peoples of China and Vietnam deem necessary, at any time and in any place, to jointly strike at the U.S. aggressors.

China and Vietnam are brotherly neighboring countries that depend on each other. The development of history has determined that the peoples of China and Vietnam must stand together, fight together, and win together. This strong unity based on proletarian internationalism is the most reliable guarantee for defeating the U.S. aggressors, and it is something that no one can destroy.

The Vietnamese people, with their glorious tradition and rich experience of anti-imperialist struggle, are not to be intimidated and are not to be deceived. Whether it is the U.S. imperialists' huge killing machine or their "peace talks" sugar-coated cannonballs, they will not be able to conquer the iron will of the Vietnamese people.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" is a battle cry to the 31 million Vietnamese people. In the face of such a heroic nation that is determined to make any sacrifice and to fight a protracted war until final victory, any desperate struggles of the U.S. imperialists can only hasten their ultimate failure.

The U.S. aggressors must get out of Vietnam, every last one of them! If they do not withdraw from Vietnam, we will annihilate them all!

### 中越人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起

    中越人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起
    七月二十二日，刘少奇主席代表我国七亿人民，向全世界庄严声明，最坚决地最热烈地支持胡志明主席七月十七日的《告全国同胞书》。同一天，首都百万人举行大集会和大示威。七月二十三日，我国又有十九个城市的五百多万人举行集会和游行示威。全国各地掀起了援越抗美的新高潮。这再一次表达了中国人民支援兄弟的越南人民的钢铁意志和坚强决心。
    美帝国主义肆无忌惮地轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内和第二大城市海防的滔天罪行，已经把侵略越南的战争上升到一个新的更加严重的阶段。
    美帝国主义是世界上最凶恶、最野蛮、最阴险的帝国主义，是一只外强中干的纸老虎。当它在侵越战争中连续遭到惨败的时候，它一方面疯狂地进行战争“升级”，搞战争讹诈；一方面又搬出早已被它撕得粉碎的日内瓦协议，来施放“和平谈判”的烟幕，抛出诱鱼上钩的钓饵。美帝国主义妄图借此欺骗世界舆论，束缚越南人民坚持抗美救国战争的手脚，束缚中国人民和各国革命人民支援越南人民的手脚。
    这是美帝国主义的一个大骗局、大阴谋，必须彻底揭穿。
    美帝国主义抓住这一根稻草，是救不了它的命的。日内瓦协议已经不存在了。把日内瓦协议撕得粉碎的，不是别人，正是美帝国主义自己。
    十二年前，当第一次日内瓦会议达成协议的时候，美帝国主义就拒绝签字。它很快就取代法国殖民者在越南南方的地位，制造了一个完全由美国操纵的傀儡政府。日内瓦协议规定的限制和界限，其实在那个时候就已经被打破了。
    不久之后，美帝国主义就在越南南方挑起侵略战争，血腥地屠杀几十万越南人民，完全破坏了日内瓦协议。
    从一九六四年起，美帝国主义又把侵略战火从越南南方烧向越南北方。这就进一步打破了越南南方和北方的界限。
    最近，美帝国主义更不顾越南人民、中国人民和世界革命人民的一再警告，悍然轰炸越南民主共和国首都。这就使日内瓦协议规定的一切限制和界限，统统地取消了。
    事实是这样地清楚，日内瓦协议是美国一手撕光的，战争的界限是美国一手打破的。在这种情况下，三千一百万越南人民采取一切方式，进行抗美救国战争，是他们的神圣权利，绝不再受任何限制和界限的约束了。
    中国人民一向认为，一张谈判桌子，决不会给被压迫民族带来独立和自由的新天地；一纸国际协议，决不能保证被压迫民族取得解放和幸福的新生活。美帝国主义扩大侵略的炮火，已经把日内瓦协议烧成灰烬。在这种情况下，中国人民和世界革命人民对越南人民的支持和援助，当然更加不受任何的限制和约束了。
    最近，约翰逊政府大事宣扬，什么美国准备在“日内瓦协议基础上”解决越南问题。苏联修正主义领导集团，同美帝国主义“联合行动”，串演了一幕“以炸迫和”的丑剧。印度的甘地夫人，英国的威尔逊，日本的佐藤，南斯拉夫的铁托，也都纷纷登场。　　　　
    这些人在美帝国主义的反革命两手政策中扮演了什么样的角色，起了什么样的作用呢？越南《人民报》说得好，凡是“按照美国的意愿去做的人，他们没有对解决越南问题作出任何贡献，恰恰相反，他们使问题变得更加复杂，他们的行动只能起充当强盗的帮凶作用”。
    我们一贯谴责苏联修正主义领导集团推行的民族沙文主义和民族利己主义。他们对越南的所谓援助，完全是假的，是怀着不可告人的目的的，是为了把越南问题纳入“苏美合作主宰世界”的轨道。他们是美帝国主义的头号帮凶，是出卖越南人民利益的可耻叛徒。
    中国是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的社会主义国家。无产阶级国际主义是我国对外政策的最高指导原则。为了支援越南人民彻底打败美国侵略者，我们准备承担最大的民族牺牲。中国人民下定了决心，作好了各种准备，随时随地采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动，共同打击美国侵略者。
    中越两国是唇齿相依的兄弟邻邦。历史的发展，决定了中越两国人民一定要团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。这种建立在无产阶级国际主义基础上的坚强团结，是战胜美国侵略者的最可靠的保证，是任何人也破坏不了的。
    具有反帝斗争光荣传统和丰富经验的越南人民，是吓不倒的，也是骗不了的。无论是美帝国主义的庞大的杀人机器，还是它的
  “和平谈判”的糖衣炮弹，都不可能征服越南人民的钢铁意志。
    胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》，是对三千一百万越南人民的战斗号召。在这样一个不惜任何牺牲、决心长期抗战直到彻底胜利的英雄民族面前，美帝国主义的任何疯狂挣扎，都只能加速它的最后失败。
    美国侵略军必须一个不剩地从越南滚出去！他们不从越南撤出，就把他们统统消灭光！
