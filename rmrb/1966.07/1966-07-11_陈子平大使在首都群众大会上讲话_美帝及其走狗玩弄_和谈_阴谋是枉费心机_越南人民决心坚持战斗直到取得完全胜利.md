Today, we are able to participate in this spirited mass rally jointly organized by various people's organizations in China, and we feel greatly honored and inspired. This rally reflects the firm revolutionary will of 700 million Chinese people and resolutely and indignantly condemns the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, and their aggressive war against the Vietnamese people. On behalf of the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, I express my most sincere greetings and heartfelt thanks to you, and through you, to the fraternal Chinese people. At the same time, I also express my respect and thanks to the foreign friends attending this rally.

Since June 29, the U.S. imperialists have committed new heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people, bombing the outskirts of Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Haiphong, our second-largest city, thus taking an extremely serious step in their escalation of the war of aggression. The U.S. imperialists further bombed the economic centers and densely populated areas in the North, attempting to shake the will of our people through these barbaric and adventurous acts of aggression. However, in the face of the ironclad determination to fight to the end and win of the heroic people of Hanoi and Haiphong and the entire Vietnamese nation, they have suffered a crushing defeat. On June 29 alone, the people of Hanoi and Haiphong shot down seven U.S. aggressor planes; subsequently, they, together with the people throughout the country, continued to smash the attacks of the U.S. air pirates. The people in the South, burning with hatred, have achieved new brilliant victories, striking the enemy with great force and avenging their northern compatriots. Meanwhile, the tide of condemnation against the U.S. imperialists' intensification of the war of aggression against Vietnam and their threat to world peace has surged, sweeping across the five continents. Here, on the soil of fraternal China, the Chinese government issued a powerful statement on July 3, and at the same time, from Beijing to the farthest provinces and cities, the voices of justice resounded, sternly warning the U.S. aggressors. In fact, the U.S. imperialists have already been and are being tried in the court of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world.

Currently, the Johnson administration is desperately trying to cover up its ferocious face and blood-stained hands. This is a manifestation of its further isolation and unprecedented embarrassment. It shamelessly claims that it "does not bomb residential areas" and "does not bomb economic zones"; it says it only bombs "oil depots" and "does its best to avoid killing civilians," and so on. However, these are all the lies and deceits that the Johnson administration has repeatedly uttered since August 5, 1964. The fact is that it continues to bomb our economic zones and densely populated areas, bombing schools, hospitals, nurseries, markets, churches, temples, water conservancy projects, and dikes. It savagely and inhumanely kills civilians and destroys national economic facilities. It is also drawing up bloody plans to further bomb the industrial areas of Hanoi and Haiphong, to destroy dikes and crops during the rainy season. It tramples on the most basic war conventions and has become the enemy of all progressive humanity. It also shamelessly claims that it "has not escalated the war" and that its actions "are nothing new," acting as if nothing has happened. However, it has blatantly expanded the war to the capital of another country, brazenly attacking the heart of an independent, sovereign socialist state, thus taking a new and extremely serious step in intensifying the war of aggression. It is stepping up its aggression and threats against the people of Laos and Cambodia and is attempting to expand the war to the entire Indochina. Who has flagrantly violated all international laws and trampled on the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Indochina issue? It is the U.S. imperialists. Who is the enemy of peace and security for the people of Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world? It is the U.S. imperialists. We once again call on the fraternal Chinese people and the people of the world to strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' extremely heinous actions and plots, to cut off their claws, and to smash their plans to expand the war. As pointed out in the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on June 30: "We sternly warn the U.S. aggressors: Every time you escalate the war in Vietnam, you will be smashed, and every one of your evil deeds will be punished as it deserves." We are confident that in the face of the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people and the strong opposition of the Chinese people, the people of socialist countries, and the people of the world, the U.S. imperialists' treacherous actions and plots will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

Comrades and friends,

The U.S. imperialists' further escalation of the war of aggression against Vietnam proves that they are increasingly weak and have reached a dead end. Everyone knows that since the U.S. imperialists began their aggression against Vietnam, all their strategic plans have suffered one defeat after another. After the failure of their "special war," they recklessly pushed the war into a new strategic phase: sending expeditionary forces to directly invade the South, attempting to seize the initiative and "achieve victory," while using their air force to begin and gradually expand the war of destruction against the North, attempting to shake the will of the people in the North and to extinguish the struggle of our entire people. However, the development of the situation is completely the opposite of the U.S. imperialists' foolish calculations. Under the slogans of "one hand on the plow, one hand on the gun" and "one hand with a hammer, one hand with a gun," the people in the North have striven to fight while producing, fully playing the role of the rear base. Despite the enemy's destruction and natural disasters, the production of the North, which is mainly agricultural, continues to develop, the transportation lines are still operating normally, and the people's lives are still guaranteed. By July 8, a total of 1,182 U.S. aggressor planes had been shot down in the North's airspace. In the South, under the slogan of "finding Americans to kill and puppets to fight," the military and people have achieved victories of strategic significance. In just one year and three months, they have annihilated more than 200,000 enemy troops, especially recently smashing the enemy's "dry season offensive," annihilating 43,000 U.S. troops and mercenaries, and 70,000 puppet troops. On the basis of these major victories, an unstoppable mass movement to oppose the U.S.-puppet clique and overthrow the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique is increasingly widespread in the major cities of the South, fundamentally shaking the puppet regime and causing the puppet army to be on the verge of collapse, making the internal strife within the puppet army and regime more intense, and thus constantly occurring political crises and falling into an irresolvable situation. This is a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists' aggressive plans, making them desperate and trapped in a more hopeless situation. This situation clearly indicates that if the U.S. imperialists cannot win with 270,000 U.S. troops and have suffered a crushing defeat, then even if they send 400,000 to 500,000 U.S. troops, they will still be defeated by the military and people of the South. This situation also proves that no matter what means the United States uses, its policy of aggression in Vietnam will inevitably suffer a thorough failure.

The U.S. imperialists, like a dying beast, the more desperate they are, the more ferocious and crazy they become. The U.S. imperialists' various strategic plans have failed. Recently, they are again attempting to reverse the situation with reckless actions. They are still in a completely passive situation. On the one hand, they are desperately recruiting cannon fodder to send to the South, doing everything possible to convene so-called "ministerial meetings of the Asia-Pacific region," "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meetings," and so on, plotting to surround and attack the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and other countries. At present, they are using this to force their lackeys and allies to send troops to South Vietnam to be cannon fodder. They have used all barbaric means: from using chemical poisons and gases in the South to dispatching B-52 bombers for continuous bombing, from implementing the "burn it all, kill it all, destroy it all" policy in the South to carrying out bloody suppression and massacre of urban mass movements and opposition groups. On the other hand, they have further intensified the war of destruction against the North, bombing economic zones and densely populated areas, and water conservancy and dike projects. They have begun using B-52 bombers for bombing and have started bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. At the same time, the U.S. imperialists, as in the past, are slandering the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and, through various channels, are playing a new "peace offensive" trick. While continuously sending troops and weapons to the South and bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, they, together with their accomplices, are shouting about "seeking peace," "the door is still open," "prepared to negotiate at any time and any place," "as long as there is a room, a table, and someone willing to talk," and so on. This is simply outrageous! The Johnson administration has once again exposed its despicable face of crying wolf and is once again playing its shameful blackmail of force, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to surrender and capitulate.

However, the U.S. imperialists' desperate struggle is in vain. The reality on the battlefield in the South shows that the more U.S. troops are sent, the greater and more crushing the defeat they suffer. The heroic military and people of the South, closely united around their true and only legitimate representative, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, will achieve greater victories. They are victorious in every battle and grow stronger with each battle; the mass movements in the cities will continue to rise, and the enemy's political crisis will become more serious. The people in the North are not afraid of the U.S. imperialists' bombs; instead, their determination to defeat the U.S. imperialists is even greater. The flames of anger of our 31 million compatriots will burn even more fiercely, and in the miraculous people's war, they will burn the U.S. aggressors to death. The Vietnamese people have long seen through the nature of the U.S. imperialists and their tricks and deceptions from their own bloody experiences. For the defense of the North, the liberation of the South, and the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, the Vietnamese people are resolved to fight to the end until there is not a single U.S. aggressor on our soil. The beloved leader of the Vietnamese people, President Ho Chi Minh, said: "Our people are determined to fight, to endure sacrifices, for ten years, twenty years, or even longer, until we achieve complete victory." "We will never surrender to the U.S. imperialists' aggression." This is the crystallization of the unshakable will of the 31 million Vietnamese people.

The Johnson administration is again desperately playing the "peace talks" trick, attempting to cover up its plans to intensify the war of aggression and deceive the American people and world public opinion. It slanders the Vietnamese people for "invading the South," "refusing to negotiate," and being the "main obstacle to peace," and so on. However, its "peace" is actually to realize its ambition of permanently occupying the South and permanently dividing the territory of Vietnam; its "negotiations" are actually to use military actions to force others to negotiate with it and accept its rule, merely to seek what it cannot obtain on the battlefield. It also proposes "negotiations based on the Geneva Agreement." However, the ones who trample on this international agreement are precisely they. The U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong has once again exposed their "peace talks" trick. We want to tell them directly: No matter when or how, they cannot make the Vietnamese people surrender. The Vietnamese people have fought, are fighting, and are determined to continue fighting until the final victory. The only way to solve the Vietnamese problem is the way pointed out by the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The U.S. government must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and all other acts of war, stop the war of aggression against South Vietnam, and must withdraw all U.S. and puppet troops and weapons from South Vietnam, allowing the South Vietnamese people to solve their own internal affairs. Apart from this, there is no other way. As long as the national fundamental rights of the Vietnamese people are not respected and guaranteed, any "peace talks" trick of the U.S. and its lackeys will only be a deception and will inevitably fail.

Comrades and friends,

Vietnam and China are socialist fraternal neighbors who are inseparable. In the past war against French colonialism and in the current socialist construction and the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, the Vietnamese people have always received immense and proletarian internationalist sympathy, support, and aid from the Chinese government and the fraternal Chinese people. The great support and aid from China, as well as China's great assistance in fully and timely transporting aid materials from other fraternal countries to Vietnam, have made important contributions to strengthening our national defense forces and defeating the U.S. aggressors. In the face of the U.S. imperialists' further intensification of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the Chinese government and people, as in the past, have once again expressed their strong condemnation of the U.S. imperialists and their firm support for the Vietnamese people, which is clearly manifested in the statement issued by the Chinese government on July 3: "The Chinese people keep their word, China is prepared, and if the war breaks out, there will be no limits. We want to warn the U.S. imperialists that no matter where you want to expand the war, no matter what price you want to pay, we will firmly support the fraternal Vietnamese people to fight to the end until we drive out all U.S. aggressors from Vietnam and achieve final victory." The powerful statement of the 700 million Chinese people is a great encouragement to our Vietnamese people's sacred cause of resisting U.S. aggression and saving the nation. This statement proves that under the leadership of the respected Chairman Mao Zedong, the fraternal Chinese people have always, in the spirit of precious proletarian internationalism, given us sympathy, support, and aid. The statement of the powerful People's Republic of China, which is vigorously carrying out the Cultural Revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, is a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists' plots to strengthen aggression and expand the war. We sincerely thank the fraternal Chinese government and people for their sympathy and support. We sincerely thank the people of socialist countries and the people of all countries for their sympathy and support. We sincerely thank our friends who are fighting for national independence, peace, and justice and all people for their sympathy and support. We thank them for their enthusiastic support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression at the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers held in Beijing and in other places on various continents. We are confident that, with an iron will and the strong support of the people of socialist countries and the people of the world, Vietnam will certainly fight to the end and will surely achieve a thorough victory.

The U.S. imperialists will suffer a shameful defeat!

The Vietnamese people will achieve a brilliant victory!

Long live the indestructible fighting friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China!

    陈子平大使在首都群众大会上讲话
    美帝及其走狗玩弄“和谈”阴谋是枉费心机  越南人民决心坚持战斗直到取得完全胜利
    今天，我们能够参加由中国各人民团体联合举行的这个斗志昂扬的群众大会，感到十分高兴和振奋。这个大会体现了七亿中国人民坚定的革命意志，坚决和愤怒地谴责美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防，谴责美帝国主义对越南人民进行的侵略战争。我代表越南人民和越南民主共和国政府向你们，并通过你们向兄弟的中国人民致以最亲切的敬意和最衷心的感谢。同时，我还向参加这个大会的其他外国朋友表示敬意和感谢。
    从六月二十九日起，美帝国主义又对越南人民犯下了新的滔天罪行，轰炸了越南民主共和国首都河内和我国第二大城市海防的外围地区，从而在它侵略战争“升级”中又跨出了极其严重的一步。美帝国主义进一步空袭北方的经济中心和人口稠密地区，企图用这种野蛮和冒险的侵略行动，来动摇我国人民的斗志。但是，在英雄的河内、海防军民和越南全国人民坚如钢铁的决战决胜意志面前，它们遭到了迎头痛击。仅在六月二十九日这一天，河内、海防军民就把七架美国强盗飞机打得粉身碎骨；接着他们又同全国军民一起连续粉碎了美国空中强盗的进攻。南方军民怀着满腔仇恨，用新的辉煌战绩，给敌人以强有力的打击，为北方同胞报仇。与此同时，谴责美帝国主义强化侵越战争和威胁世界和平的怒潮，汹涌澎湃，席卷五大洲。在这里，在兄弟的中国的土地上，中国政府七月三日发表了强有力的声明，与此同时，从北京到遥远的省、市，都响彻了正义的呼声，严厉警告美国侵略者。实际上，美帝国主义者已经在、并正在越南人民、中国人民和全世界人民的法庭上受到审判。
    目前约翰逊政府正在竭力掩盖它的凶恶面目和沾满鲜血的双手。这是它进一步孤立和空前狼狈的表现。它胡说什么“从不轰炸居民、从不轰炸经济区”；还说什么只炸“油库”，“尽量避免杀害平民”等等。但是这些完全是强盗的腔调，是约翰逊政府自从一九六四年八月五日以来一再重弹的抵赖和欺骗的陈腔滥调。事实是，它仍然不断空袭我国的经济区和人口稠密区，轰炸学校、医院、托儿所、集市、教堂、寺庙、水利工程和堤坝。它野蛮地、灭绝人性地杀害平民，破坏国民经济设施。它还在制订对河内和海防工业区进一步狂轰滥炸、在雨季炸毁堤坝，破坏庄稼的血腥计划。它践踏最起码的战争公约，并成为全体进步人类的敌人。它还胡说什么“并没有使战争升级”，它的行动“并不是什么新的”，装作没有发生过什么事情的样子。但是，事实上它已明目张胆地把战火扩大到另一个国家的首都，悍然进攻一个独立的、有主权的社会主义国家的心脏，从而在强化侵略战争方面跨出了新的极为严重的一步。它正在加紧对老挝和柬埔寨人民的侵略和威胁，并且妄图把战争扩大到整个印度支那。谁无视一切国际法、践踏一九五四年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议？正是美帝国主义。谁是印度支那、东南亚和世界人民和平和安宁的敌人？正是美帝国主义。我们再一次呼吁兄弟的中国人民和全世界人民强烈谴责美帝国主义的这种罪大恶极的行动和阴谋，斩断它的魔爪，粉碎它扩大战争的计划。正如越南民主共和国外交部六月三十日发表的声明所指出的：“我们严厉警告美国侵略者：你们在越南的每次战争‘升级’必将遭到粉碎，你们的每个罪恶行动必将遭到应有的惩罚”。我们坚信，在越南人民的英勇斗争面前，在中国人民，社会主义各国人民和全世界人民的强烈反对下，美帝国主义阴险的行动和阴谋必将遭到可耻的失败。
    同志们，朋友们，
    美帝国主义在侵略越南的战争中进一步“升级”的行动，证明了美帝国主义日益衰弱并已陷入了穷途末路的境地。大家都知道，自从美帝国主义开始侵略越南到现在，它的一切战略计划接二连三地遭到了惨重的失败。美国在“特种战争”遭到破产以后，就冒险地把战争推向一个新的战略阶段：派遣远征军直接侵略南方，妄图夺取主动权和“取得胜利”，同时用空军开始进行和逐步扩大对北方的破坏性战争，妄图动摇北方人民的斗志，妄图以此扑灭我们全国人民的斗争。但是，局势的发展完全同美帝国主义的这种愚蠢的打算背道而驰。在“一手扶犁、一手拿枪”，“一手拿锤，一手拿枪”的口号下，我国北方人民努力边生产边战斗，充分地发挥了大后方的作用。尽管遭到敌人破坏和自然灾害，但是，以农业为主的北方的生产仍然继续发展，交通运输线路依然在正常活动，人民生活依然得到保障。截至七月八日为止已经有一千一百八十二架美国强盗飞机在北方的领空被击落。在南方，在“找美国佬杀，找伪军打”的口号下，南方的军民已经取得了具有战略意义的胜利，仅在一年三个月的时间内就消灭了二十多万敌军，特别是最近又粉碎了敌人的“旱季攻势”，消灭了美军和仆从军队四万三千多人，伪军七万人。在这些重大胜利的基础上，一个反对美伪集团，推翻阮文绍—阮高其集团的不可扑灭的群众运动正在南方的各大城市中日益广泛地发展起来，从根本上动摇了伪政权，并使伪军濒于土崩瓦解，使伪军和伪政权的内部倾轧更加剧烈，从而不断地发生政治危机并陷入了无法解决的境地。这是对美帝国主义侵略计划的一个十分沉重的打击，使美帝国主义走投无路，陷入困境，到了更加无法挽救的地步。这种情况肯定地说明了如果美帝国主义用二十七万美军不能取胜，遭到了惨败，那么，纵使它派出四十到五十万美军，仍然要被南方军民打败。这种情况还证明了，美国不管用什么办法，它在越南的侵略政策也一定不可避免地要遭到彻底的破产。
    美帝国主义象垂死挣扎的野兽一样，越是走投无路，就越凶悍和疯狂。美帝国主义的各种战略计划已告破产。最近，它又正在企图以冒险行动来挽回败局。它仍然处在完全被动的情况下。一方面，它竭力搜罗炮灰运进南方，千方百计召开所谓“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”、“东南亚条约组织会议”等，策划对中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国……等国家的包围和进攻。目前是借此强迫其仆从和拉拢其盟国派军队到南越去作替死鬼。它使出了一切野蛮的手段：从对南方使用化学毒药和毒气到派遣B52型飞机进行连续不断的轰炸，从对南方采用杀光、烧光、毁光政策到对城市群众运动和反对派实行血腥镇压和屠杀。另方面，他们进一步加强了对北方的破坏性战争，对经济区和人口稠密区，对水利和堤坝工程进行狂轰滥炸。它开始使用了B52型飞机进行轰炸，开始轰炸了河内和海防。同时，美帝国主义这次还同过去一样，大肆诬蔑越南人民和越南民主共和国政府，并通过各方面关系玩弄新的“和平攻势”骗局。美国在向南方连续增兵，运送武器弹药和空袭河内、海防的同时，又和它的同伙叫嚷什么“寻找和平”、“门仍在开着”、“准备在任何地方、任何时候进行谈判”，“只要有一个房间、一张桌子和愿意说话的人”等等……简直是岂有此理！约翰逊政府再一次暴露了它贼喊捉贼的卑鄙面目，又一次玩弄它可耻的武力讹诈手段，妄图迫使越南人民向它屈服投降。
    但是，美帝国主义的这种绝望的挣扎还是枉费心机，南方战场的现实表明了：美帝国主义越增兵，就越遭到更大、更惨重的失败。英雄的南方军民紧密团结在自己真正和唯一合法的代表——越南南方民族解放阵线的周围，将取得更大的胜利。他们屡战屡胜，愈战愈强；城市的群众运动将日益高涨，敌人的政治危机将更加严重。北方人民对美帝国主义的炸弹不但毫无畏惧，相反，他们打败美帝国主义的决心更大。我们三千一百万同胞愤怒火焰将越烧越旺，在神奇的人民战争中将把美国强盗烧死。我们越南人民从自己血的经验教训中，早就看清了美帝国主义的本性，看穿了它的阴谋和欺骗手段。我们越南人民为了保卫北方，解放南方，和平统一祖国，决心战斗到底，直到在自己的国土上看不到一个美国侵略者的影子为止。越南全国人民敬爱的领袖胡志明主席说：“我国人民决心坚持战斗，忍受牺牲，不管十年、二十年或更长的时间，直到取得完全胜利。”“我们决不屈服于美帝国主义的侵略”。这就是三千一百万越南人民的这种坚定不移的意志的结晶。
    约翰逊政府又在竭力玩弄“和谈”骗局，妄图掩盖它扩大侵略战争的计划，欺骗美国人民和世界舆论。它诬蔑越南人民“侵略南方”，“拒绝谈判”，“是和平的主要障碍”等等。可是，它玩弄“和平”，实际是为了实现永远占领南方，长期分割越南国土的野心；它搞“谈判”，实际是用战争行动妄图强迫别人同它谈判和接受它的统治，只不过是想谋取它在战场上得不到的东西。它还提出“在日内瓦协议基础上进行谈判”。但是，践踏这个国际协议的正是它们。美帝国主义对河内、海防的轰炸再一次揭穿了它的“和谈”骗局。我们要直截了当地告诉它们：不论任何时候采用任何方式都不能使越南人民屈服。越南人民已经打、正在打并且决心继续打到最后胜利。解决越南问题的唯一途径，就是越南民主共和国政府四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线五点声明所指出的途径。美国政府必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动，停止对越南南方的侵略战争，必须把美国及其仆从的军队、武器全部撤出越南南方，由越南南方人民自己解决自己的内部事务。除此以外，没有任何其他途径。只要越南人民的民族基本权利得不到尊重和保证，那么美帝及其走狗的任何“和谈”阴谋都只不过是个骗局，一定会遭到破产。
    同志们和朋友们，
    越中两国是唇齿相依的社会主义兄弟邻邦。在过去抗击法国殖民主义的战争中以及在当前社会主义建设事业和抗美救国斗争中，我们越南人民一贯得到中国政府和兄弟的中国人民无比巨大和充满无产阶级国际主义的同情、支持和援助。中国的巨大支持和援助以及中国大力协助我们充分和及时地转运其他兄弟国家援越物资，为增强我国的国防力量，战胜美国侵略者作出了重要的贡献。在美帝进一步强化侵越战争的情况下，中国政府和中国人民同以往一样再次表示了强烈谴责美帝和坚决支持越南人民的态度，这一点在中国政府于七月三日发表的声明中得到了明确的体现：“中国人民说了话是算数的，中国是作了准备的，战争打起来就没有界限了。我们要正告美帝国主义者，不管你们要把战争扩大到什么地方，不管要付出多大的代价，我们都将坚定不移地支持兄弟的越南人民打到底，直到把美国侵略者全部彻底赶出越南，取得最后胜利。”七亿中国人民的这一强有力的声明，是对我们越南人民抗美救国神圣事业的巨大鼓舞。这个声明证明了：在以敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，兄弟的中国人民始终本着可贵的无产阶级国际主义精神给予我们同情、支持和援助。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下蓬勃开展文化大革命的强大的中华人民共和国的这一声明，是对美帝国主义阴谋加强侵略和扩大战争的沉重打击。我们衷心地感谢兄弟的中国政府和人民的同情和支持。我们衷心地感谢社会主义国家人民和世界各国人民的同情和支持。我们衷心地感谢正在为民族独立、和平和正义而战斗的朋友们和所有人们的同情和支持。感谢他们在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议上和在各大洲的其他地方的热情支持越南人民反对美帝侵略而发出的正义呼声。我们坚信，由于有着钢铁般的决心和得到社会主义国家和全世界人民的强有力的支持，越南一定要把反美斗争进行到底，并且必将取得彻底胜利。
    美帝国主义必将遭到可耻的失败！
    越南人民必将取得辉煌的胜利！
    越中两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
