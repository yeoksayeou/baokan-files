On June 16, the United Press International reported: According to communist sources, due to China's demand for payment in kind rather than in dollars or gold for transportation and customs fees, a large amount of Soviet aid to Vietnam has been stranded on the Sino-Soviet border; China has seized some parts of ground-to-air missiles and MiG aircraft as payment, etc. The same day's *Indian Express* and the June 17 *Daily Telegraph* also reported similar news, claiming that Soviet officials had lodged a strong protest against China over this matter, and the Vietnamese side had also made representations to the Chinese side.

Regarding the above rumors, the Vietnam News Agency, authorized on June 19, issued a statement pointing out that this is completely fabricated and is a despicable plot to sow discord.

So, who exactly is the fabricator of these rumors?

Everyone knows that the countries involved in the transit of Soviet aid to Vietnam are only Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union. The Vietnamese side has already refuted the rumors. The Chinese side, of course, would not fabricate rumors about itself. Therefore, where do the rumors come from? Isn't it clear?

The so-called "communist sources" in the United Press International report are clearly the Soviet revisionist leadership.

After Khrushchev's fall, the Soviet revisionist leadership has been playing tricks, turning past non-intervention policies into current intervention policies, using "aid to Vietnam to fight the Americans" as a cover to spread anti-China rumors. As early as February 1965, when the Soviet Union proposed that the Chinese side assist in the transit of Soviet aid to Vietnam, the Soviet revisionist leadership began spreading lies through various channels, both domestically and internationally, that China was obstructing the transit of Soviet aid to Vietnam.

These lies are not only spread within the Soviet Party and among other revisionist-led parties, but are also openly published in Soviet newspapers and spoken by high-level Soviet officials, providing ammunition for anti-China propaganda by the imperialists led by the United States. In December 1965, the Soviet magazine *Abroad* published an article accusing China of demanding that the Soviet Union pay for the transit of aid to Vietnam in dollars. On April 21, 1966, Marshal Malinovsky, a high-ranking Soviet official, publicly accused China of obstructing Soviet aid to Vietnam in a speech in Hungary.

The lies fabricated by the Soviet revisionist leadership and spread by American and Western news agencies are becoming increasingly absurd and bizarre. First, they accused China of obstructing the transport of Soviet aid to Vietnam, then they accused China of demanding dollars and rubles as transit fees, and now they accuse China of demanding payment in kind and seizing Soviet aid to Vietnam as payment. The Soviet revisionist leadership creates the rumors, and American news agencies spread them worldwide. Soviet magazines like *Abroad* then publish them. Look how skillfully and closely they collaborate.

Regarding these lies, the Chinese side has repeatedly refuted them with facts. The facts are: all military aid that the Soviet side is willing to provide and that Vietnam agrees to accept, the Chinese side has agreed to assist in transit without obstruction; when Soviet aid to Vietnam arrives at the Chinese border, the Chinese railways immediately transport it by express military means, without delay, and there has never been any backlog; the Chinese railways provide free transit for all military aid, and we have never collected a single ruble, dollar, or gram of gold from the Soviet government, let alone any real goods like ground-to-air missiles.

The Soviet revisionist leadership is fully aware of all this. They fabricate absurd lies without regard for the facts to deceive world public opinion, deliberately sow discord between the Chinese and Vietnamese parties, countries, and peoples, disrupt the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and serve the interests of American imperialism.

The Soviet revisionist leadership repeatedly fabricates anti-China lies to meet the needs of American imperialism. American imperialism spreads these lies, which is also what the Soviet revisionist leadership needs. This is not an accidental or isolated incident. It reflects the close collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States on the Vietnam issue, their collusion, and the essence of their joint actions. This is, the Soviet Union and the United States jointly oppose China, jointly disrupt the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, and jointly disrupt the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

The more outrageous the lies, the faster they will be exposed. Those who rely on spreading rumors to survive will not last long and will not have a good outcome.

    谁是谣言的制造者？
    本报评论员
    六月十六日，美国合众国际社报道：据共产党人士称，由于中国要求以实物、而不是以美元或黄金做为运费和关税，大批苏联援越物资被搁置在中苏边界；中国强夺了一些地对空导弹和米格机的一些零件作为运费，等等。同日的《印度快报》和十七日的英国《每日电讯报》，都作了类似的报道，并且煞有介事地说，苏联官员已就此向中国提出了强烈的抗议，越南方面也已向中国方面提出了交涉。
    对于上述谣言，越南通讯社受权于六月十九日发表声明，指出这完全是捏造的，是怀着极为卑鄙的挑拨阴谋的。
    那么，究竟谁是谣言的制造者呢？
    人们都知道，同转运苏联援越军事物资有关的当事国只有越南、中国和苏联三家。对于上述谣言，越南方面已予以驳斥。中国方面当然不会自己造自己的谣言。那末，谣言究竟来自哪里，难道还不清楚吗？美国合众国际社报道中的所谓“共产党人士”，明明白白，不是别人，就是苏联修正主义领导集团。
    赫鲁晓夫下台以后，苏联修正主义领导集团就玩弄假援越、真出卖的把戏，变过去的脱身政策为现在的插手政策，以“援越反美”为名，行造谣反华之实。早自一九六五年二月苏联提出要中国方面协助转运苏联援越军事物资过境的那时起，苏联修正主义领导集团就通过各种渠道，在国内外大量散布所谓中国阻挠苏联援越军事物资过境的谎言。
    这种谎言，不仅在苏联党内国内、在其它修正主义集团领导的党内国内广为散布，而且公开见诸苏联报刊，公然出自苏联高级官员之口，为以美国为首的帝国主义提供反华弹药。一九六五年十二月，苏联《在国外》杂志第五十期载文，诬蔑中国要苏联用美元交付援越物资的过境运费。一九六六年四月二十一日，苏联政府的高级官员国防部长马利诺夫斯基在匈牙利的一次讲话中，公开诬蔑中国阻挠苏联对越南的所谓援助。
    苏联修正主义领导集团捏造的、美国和西方通讯社广为传播的这种谎言，越来越荒唐，越来越离奇。先是诬蔑中国阻挠苏联援越军事物资的运输，继而诬蔑中国向苏联索取美元和卢布作为过境运费，现在竟然诬蔑中国要求以实物支付运费，并且强夺了苏联援越军事物资作为运费。苏联修正主义集团制造出谣言，美国通讯社给它向全世界传播，苏联《在国外》之类的杂志再把它刊登出来。请看，它们这两家合作得多么巧妙，多么紧密呵。
    对于这种谎言，中国方面曾不止一次地列举事实，给予了有力的驳斥。事实是：凡属苏联方面愿意提供、越南方面同意接受的军援物资，中国方面一律同意协助转运，从未阻挠；苏联援越军事物资到达中国边境，中国铁路都立即以特快的军运办法予以转运，从未拖延，也根本没有发生过积压的现象；中国铁路对所有军援物资的转运都是免费的，我们从来没有向苏联政府收取过一个卢布、一块美元、半个格兰姆黄金，更不用说什么地对空导弹之类的实物了。
    所有这些，苏联修正主义领导集团本来是一清二楚的。他们所以不顾事实、无休止地捏造荒诞无稽的谎言，是为了欺骗世界舆论，蓄意挑拨中越两党、两国和两国人民的战斗友谊，破坏越南人民的抗美救国斗争，为美帝国主义效劳。
    苏联修正主义领导集团一而再、再而三地制造反华谎言，是适应美帝国主义需要的。美帝国主义广为传播这种谎言，也是苏联修正主义领导集团需要的。这决不是偶然的个别的事件。它反映了苏美在越南问题上密切配合，狼狈为奸，反映了苏美联合行动的灵魂。这就是，苏美联合反华，苏美联合破坏中越两国人民的友谊和团结，苏美联合破坏越南人民的抗美救国斗争。
    谎言造得越离奇，就破产得越快。靠造谣过日子的人，是混不了多久的，是决不会有好结果的。
