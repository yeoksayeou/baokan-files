On July 23, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on the fourth anniversary of the 1962 Geneva Agreement, strongly condemning and denouncing the U.S. for systematically destroying the Geneva Agreement on the Lao issue. It reaffirmed the Lao people's determination to closely cooperate with the peoples of the Indochina countries to fight against and thwart all the evil schemes of U.S. imperialism. This statement is a stern warning and powerful response from the heroic Lao people to the U.S. imperialists' plot to expand the war of aggression in Laos and the entire Indochina.

There are two Geneva Agreements on the Indochina issue. The 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Vietnam issue has long been completely torn up by U.S. imperialism. The 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Lao issue has also been completely destroyed by U.S. imperialism.

The national unity government composed of the three sides in Laos has been destroyed by the artillery fire of the right-wing military coup in Vientiane, orchestrated by U.S. imperialism.

The military ceasefire in Laos has been completely destroyed by the actions of the U.S. and the right-wing forces attacking the liberated areas.

The number of U.S. military personnel entering Laos has reached over five thousand and is still increasing. Laos is becoming another base for its war of aggression.

The U.S. imperialists' brazen destruction of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Lao issue once again tells people that all oppressed nations cannot rely on the "guarantees" of international agreements for their liberation. Only by fighting against U.S. imperialism head-on is the correct path for all peoples to struggle for and maintain independence. The U.S. aggressors will not be defeated without a fight. Over the past four years, the Lao people and the People's Liberation Army, together with the patriotic neutral armed forces, have thwarted all attacks by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, defending the liberated areas that make up two-thirds of the country. The Lao people have shown their strong will and power to unite and fight to the end in their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

The statement of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front clearly points out: "If the U.S. government and its followers blindly continue down the evil path of aggression and war, then the Lao Patriotic Front and all the Lao people, in order to smash the aggressive purposes of U.S. imperialism and to liberate the entire country, will take all appropriate measures to counterattack." The Chinese people fully support the Lao people's just countermeasures and sacred national rights.

In the U.S.'s criminal activities of expanding the war in Laos, the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos has become a shameful accomplice. U.S. bandit planes indiscriminately bomb the liberated areas of Laos, and it remains silent. The U.S. instigates and intensifies the civil war in Laos, and it vigorously shields the aggressors. This commission has completely betrayed the Geneva Agreement and become a tool for U.S. imperialist aggression. What reason is there for such an organization to continue to exist? The Chinese people fully support the just demand proposed by the Voice of the Lao Patriotic Front on July 20 to completely stop the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos.

The Lao people are a people with a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, a people who dare to fight and dare to win. No matter how frantically U.S. imperialism struggles, no matter how much Phoumi Novasouk invites the wolves in, it cannot change the trend of developments in Laos. The just cause of the heroic Lao people to resist the U.S. and save the nation will surely be victorious. U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will surely not escape the punishment of history.

    美国是破坏老挝问题日内瓦协议的罪魁
    本报评论员
    七月二十三日，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会就一九六二年日内瓦协议签订四周年发表声明，强烈控诉和谴责美国有计划地破坏了关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，重申老挝人民决心同印度支那各国人民紧密协力进行斗争，挫败美帝国主义的一切险恶图谋。这个声明，是英勇的老挝人民对美帝国主义在老挝和整个印度支那扩大侵略战火的阴谋的严正警告和有力回答。
    在印度支那问题上，有两个日内瓦协议。一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，早已被美帝国主义彻底撕光了。一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，也已经被美帝国主义完全破坏了。
    老挝三方面组成的民族团结政府，已经被美帝国主义策动的万象右派军事政变的炮火摧毁了。
    老挝的军事停战，已经被美帝国主义伙同右派悍然进攻解放区的行动彻底破坏了。
    美国进入老挝的军人，已达五千多人，并且还在继续增加，老挝正在变成它侵略战争的又一个策源地。
    美帝国主义肆无忌惮地破坏一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的罪行，再一次用事实告诉人们，一切被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在国际协议的“保证”上面。只有同美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争，才是各国人民争取和维护独立的唯一正确道路。美国侵略者是不打不倒的。四年来，老挝人民和人民解放军同爱国的中立武装力量团结起来，粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗的一切进攻，保卫了占全国土地三分之二的解放区。老挝人民在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中，显示了他们团结一致、战斗到底的坚强意志和力量。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的声明明确指出：“如果美国政府及其追随者盲目地在侵略和战争的罪恶道路上走下去，那么老挝爱国战线党和全体老挝人民，为了粉碎美帝国主义的侵略目的，为了解放全部国土，将采取一切适当的措施予以反击。”中国人民完全支持老挝人民这一严正的反击措施和神圣的民族权利。
    在美国扩大老挝战争的罪恶活动中，老挝国际委员会充当了可耻的帮凶。美国强盗飞机狂轰滥炸老挝解放区，它不吭一声。美国挑起并加剧老挝内战，它竭力包庇。这个委员会彻底背弃了日内瓦协议，成了美帝国主义的侵略工具。这样一个机构，还有什么理由继续存在下去呢？中国人民完全支持巴特寮电台七月二十日提出的全部停止老挝国际委员会活动的正当要求。
    老挝人民是有着反帝斗争光荣传统的人民，敢于斗争、敢于胜利的人民。不管美帝国主义怎样疯狂挣扎，不管富马怎样引狼入室，都无法改变老挝局势发展的趋势。英雄的老挝人民反美救国的正义事业一定会胜利。美帝国主义及其走狗也一定逃不脱历史的惩罚。
