Chinese delegation head Guo Moruo delivers a lengthy speech at the Asia-Africa Writers Emergency Conference

The Chinese people's support for Vietnam against U.S. aggression is more unrestrained and unlimited

Representatives from various countries continue to strongly condemn U.S. imperialism's crimes in Vietnam, emphasizing the need to form a broad and genuine anti-U.S. united front. Representatives enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao Zedong as the great helmsman of China and the world.

The conference read a congratulatory message from the Chinese Federation of Literature and Art Circles.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guo Moruo, the head of the Chinese delegation, said today at the plenary session of the Asia-Africa Writers Emergency Conference: "Our seven hundred million people, with one heart and one mind, fully support the statement issued by our government on July 3, and act in accordance with it. We will do everything possible, unrestrained and unlimited, to firmly and unshakably support our Vietnamese brothers until we decisively, thoroughly, and completely annihilate the U.S. aggressors!"

Guo Moruo today, at the ongoing plenary session, delivered a lengthy speech titled "The Historical Mission of Asian and African Writers to Unite and Fight Against Imperialism" (full text on pages 1 and 3). In his speech, he angrily denounced U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, particularly its recent reckless and mad adventure of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong.

He also discussed the current favorable situation of the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples. He said, a great storm against U.S. imperialism is raging in the skies of the world. This storm sweeps across Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the entire world. Hundreds of millions of oppressed people are bravely fighting against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, and the tide of national liberation is fiercely sweeping away the reactionary rule of imperialism.

Representatives from Syria, Comoros, Sudan, Ivory Coast, Rwanda, and other countries (regions), observer Gunawadana from the Asian Economic Discussion Conference, observer Charo from the Asia-Africa Journalists Association, representatives from China, Turkey, Uganda, and other countries, observer Louis Aylor from the Asia-Pacific Regional Peace Liaison Committee, observer Hiroshi Motoda from the Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and observer Naruhiro Narita from the Secretariat of the Asia-Africa Lawyers Conference (speech summaries on page 6) all spoke at today's meeting.

Representatives from various countries (regions) and international organizations' observers continued to strongly condemn U.S. imperialism's savage aggression against Vietnam and its recent mad bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong. They united in their hatred of the enemy, emphasizing that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Vietnamese people, the Asian and African peoples, and the people of the world. The peoples of various countries must form a broad and genuine anti-U.S. united front and fight to the end against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States.

In their speeches, they also severely condemned the Soviet Union's modern revisionist leadership's plot to realize the evil scheme of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to rule the world." The speakers pointed out that in the global anti-U.S. united front, modern revisionists, these fake revolutionaries, must not be included because they are the shameful accomplices of U.S. imperialism.

Guo Moruo's speech was warmly received. During his speech, the audience stood up several times and applauded thunderously. At the end of his speech, the entire audience stood up again and applauded warmly for a long time. Many representatives and international organizations' observers came up to shake his hand and embrace him, expressing their respect to the great Chinese people.

Many representatives, with sincere feelings, used the most beautiful language to praise Chairman Mao. They said, "Chairman Mao Zedong is the great helmsman of China and the world," "Mao Zedong Thought is the sunlight that illuminates the path for us and for all the people of the world who struggle for progress and liberation," "Great Mao Zedong Thought belongs not only to the Chinese people but to all the peoples of the world," "Chairman Mao Zedong is the supreme commander of the world revolution."

Representatives from Sudan, Ivory Coast, Rwanda, Uganda, and other countries all expressed their full support for the suggestion made by the Indonesian representative to hold the third Asia-Africa Writers Conference in Beijing.

At today's meeting, a congratulatory message from the Chinese Federation of Literature and Art Circles to this conference was read.

The executive chairpersons for today's morning session were representatives from Lebanon, Syria, Thailand, Congo (Leopoldville), Guinea, and Ghana. The executive chairpersons for the afternoon session were representatives from India, Turkey, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Madagascar, Mali, and Congo (Brazzaville).

Xinhua News Agency, July 4th: The Chinese Federation of Literature and Art Circles today sent a letter to the Asia-Africa Writers Emergency Conference expressing the warmest congratulations. The message said, Chinese literary and artistic workers will closely unite with Asian and African writers, firmly grasp the revolutionary and fighting pen, throw themselves into the struggle against imperialism led by the United States, support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, serve the revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples, and fight the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle to the end.

The message said, U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the people of the world. Its claws of aggression stretch into the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Every day, it is killing, arson, sabotage, and subversion. The countless crimes it has committed in invading Vietnam are beyond description. This Asia-Africa Writers Emergency Conference's denunciation of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and support for the Vietnamese people's great struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation is another heavy blow to the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism.

The message said, Chinese literary and artistic workers resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The recent reckless and mad bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by U.S. imperialism has caused the Chinese literary and artistic workers to express their utmost indignation and strongest condemnation. The message expressed that Chinese literary and artistic workers resolutely support the statement issued by the Chinese government on July 3rd, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression.

The message said, Soviet revisionists are the accomplices of U.S. imperialism in suppressing the national liberation movements of Asia and Africa, and they are the enemies of the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa. The split conference in Cairo, planned by Soviet writers, fully exposed the counter-revolutionary nature of Soviet revisionists, who are fake anti-imperialists, true surrenderers, fake supporters, true betrayers, fake unifiers, and true splitters. To fight the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle to the end, it is necessary to thoroughly expose and resolutely oppose Soviet revisionism. Chinese literary and artistic workers fully support and endorse the statement issued by the Asia-Africa Writers Permanent Bureau on June 23rd, condemning Soviet revisionists.

The message pointed out that currently, our people are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carrying out an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution. All our revolutionary literary and artistic workers are, together with the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the whole country, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participating in this great revolutionary movement, and unshakably carrying the proletarian cultural revolution in our country to the end.

The message said, Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the Chinese revolution, the lifeline of the Chinese people, and also the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world. It shines brilliantly and is immensely powerful. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, our proletarian cultural revolution will surely achieve thorough and great victory.

The message finally said, the Asia-Africa Writers Emergency Conference is a grand review of the anti-imperialist fighting forces of Asian and African writers. We are firmly convinced that through this conference, the national cultures of the peoples of various Asian and African countries, the fighting, revolutionary, and anti-imperialist, anti-colonial cultures, will further flourish, bloom with brilliant flowers, and bear abundant fruits.
