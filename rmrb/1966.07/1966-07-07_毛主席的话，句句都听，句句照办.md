**Editor's Note:** The following is an account by Zheng Chunlan, a sanitation worker at the East China Sea Fleet Nursery, who shares her heartfelt thoughts on studying Chairman Mao's works. Her words reflect the deep love and loyalty of the working class towards Chairman Mao, serving as an excellent example of how to learn from and apply Chairman Mao's teachings.

Zheng Chunlan has an immense love for Chairman Mao's books. She endured thirty years of misery in the old society. She is grateful to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for bringing her happiness. Although she has little education and is already forty-seven years old, she understands that Chairman Mao's books are written for the poor and are revolutionary. She reads them word by word, copy them line by line, and has resolved to read Chairman Mao's books for life and follow him closely.

Zheng Chunlan is deeply loyal to Chairman Mao's words. She listens to and acts upon every word of Chairman Mao. After reading Chairman Mao's books, she resolutely follows his teachings, ridding herself of selfishness and opening her mind. Her change in thinking leads to changes in everything. She dedicates her heart to the revolution, with boundless energy. In her eyes, there is always work to be done, and she eagerly takes on any task that benefits the revolution. Not only does she learn from good examples, but she also sets a good example for the next generation, passing on the red flag and ensuring that future generations remain red.

Every cadre and soldier should learn from Zheng Chunlan, seriously study Chairman Mao's books, listen to and act upon every word of Chairman Mao, follow him closely, and do so for life.

I, a person who nearly died in the old society, am now able to share my learning experiences. Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, this would not have been possible! If not for liberation, who knows if I would still be alive!

Forty-seven years ago, I was born in a poor peasant family in Lanxi, Zhejiang. My family was so poor that they could not afford to keep me, so at just four months old, my mother sent me to be a child bride. In my husband's family, I started doing chores at the age of six or seven, cooking and working from dawn till dusk. By the time I was twelve or thirteen, my mother-in-law fell ill and died, leaving the family's clothes and shoes in my care. At seventeen, I got married, but the next year, my husband fled to avoid conscription and was gone for several years without a word. My father-in-law became paralyzed and died from lack of medical treatment. My first child went to pick wild vegetables and fell into a river and drowned. I also contracted a plague and nearly died several times but survived. In just a few years, my husband's and my families lost ten people to the old society, leaving me alone and miserable. I had no choice but to leave my hometown and work as a servant for a wealthy boss. For thirty years, I lived in tears, crying every day and hating the unfair world and my miserable fate.

Liberation came! The days of hardship are over, and life is stable. My son is in middle school. I also have a job at the East China Sea Fleet Nursery as a sanitation worker, earning dozens of yuan a month. I have enough to eat and spend, and I have both cotton and woolen clothes. My heart thinks: I must follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao closely and contribute more to the Party!

Reading Chairman Mao's Books, Following Lei Feng's Path

In the spring of 1963, the radio broadcasted Lei Feng's story every day, and the children sang about him every day. Who is Lei Feng? Chairman Mao himself wrote an inscription urging everyone to learn from him! One day, the deputy director called me to the auditorium to listen to a report. The speaker was Lei Feng's platoon leader. After listening, I understood: Lei Feng is a good soldier of Chairman Mao, and his good deeds are countless. He, like me, was also a survivor of the old society's hardships. We may have different ages, but we are all from the same bitter vine.

That night, I couldn't sleep, tossing and turning in bed, always thinking: Lei Feng and I are both people saved from the bitter sea by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Lei Feng never forgets the Party and always works hard for it; Chairman Mao praises him as a good example. I want to contribute more to the Party, so I must become a person like Lei Feng. Compared to Lei Feng, I suffered more in the old society and enjoyed more sweetness in the new society, so why should my contributions to the revolution be less? Lei Feng's good deeds are countless, but who taught him to do them? Lei Feng loves to read Chairman Mao's books, treating them as food, weapons, and a compass. He does whatever Chairman Mao says, so everything he does is praised. I am lacking in Lei Feng's good deeds by thousands and tens of thousands, and the fundamental reason is that I have not read Chairman Mao's books.

Reading Chairman Mao's books has been suggested to me by the leadership many times since 1960. But at that time, I thought: I am old, just a sanitation worker, not a cadre, and I don't need to manage people, so why read? Fortunately, Comrade Lei Feng reminded me: Chairman Mao's books are for the poor and are revolutionary. Reading them can help you revolutionize to the end, while not reading them will make you confused for life. Lei Feng is also not a cadre but a truck driver. After learning from Chairman Mao's works, he did countless good deeds. That's right! I, Zheng Chunlan, want to contribute more to the Party. The first step is to read Chairman Mao's books well.

Picking up Chairman Mao's books, a big stone blocked the way—I am illiterate! In 1959, I attended night school and finished a volume of language textbooks. Later, the night school closed, and the few characters I learned were also forgotten. If I had known I would need to read Chairman Mao's books today, I would have studied harder no matter how difficult it was. Since I can't read, I have to ask the deputy director and comrades to read to me, but this is not a long-term solution. So, I asked young people to teach me, using Chairman Mao's books as textbooks, learning both culture and politics.

At that time, a new comrade, Zhang Liying, joined the sanitation team. She was a graduate of primary school. We agreed on "one red pair" conditions: I would help her familiarize herself with the work, and she would teach me to study. I told Liying: "In the old society, not only did it destroy my family, but it also made three generations of my family illiterate. Not being able to read makes it impossible to read Chairman Mao's books. Please teach me strictly, and if you don't teach well, you will be responsible, and if I don't learn well, I will reflect. For the revolution, let's work together to remove this mountain of illiteracy!" Liying is a enthusiastic girl. She taught me to read "In Memory of Norman Bethune" word by word. After some time, I recognized more characters and remembered more of Chairman Mao's words.

Seeing the children learning to write with grid paper, I did not give up and followed them to copy Chairman Mao's quotations. "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution..." I copied and recognized these characters dozens of times. During the day, work was busy, so I studied and wrote at night. My eyes are not very good. In the old society, I cried so much that they almost went blind. If the characters are written too small, I can't see the strokes clearly, and if the light is too bright, my eyes become blurry. What should I do? Should I stop reading and writing Chairman Mao's books? No! Did Lei Feng have no difficulties reading Chairman Mao's books? He read while driving outside, and when he returned to the unit, he read until eleven o'clock at night. Even when boiling water, he read by the fire. To learn from Lei Feng's example, I must read Chairman Mao's books without fearing eye strain. Fortunately, comrades reminded me to spend a few yuan to buy a pair of old glasses. Every night, I wear them and study clearly.

Chairman Mao calls on me to learn from Lei Feng, and Lei Feng leads me to learn from Chairman Mao's works. Learning from Chairman Mao's works helps me pick up cultural studies, and learning culture helps me better read Chairman Mao's books. I am determined that in the latter half of my life, I will read Chairman Mao's books and follow Lei Feng's path, becoming a new woman with new thoughts and culture.

I Must Understand Class and Class Struggle

Opening Chairman Mao's books, the first article I studied was "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society."

I suffered for half my life in poverty, thinking it was just bad luck, and I did not know the root of my suffering. Sometimes I blamed the unfair world, but I always thought the world was arranged by heaven. It's laughable to think that I even blamed my mother for sending me to be a child bride, causing me to cry for thirty years.

Chairman Mao's books taught me to understand: it's not about bad fate or heaven's arrangement; the root of poverty and bitterness lies in the word "class." It's the landlords, capitalists, and imperialists who collude to exploit us, making it impossible for workers and poor peasants to live. To fill their granaries and fatten their wallets, they collect rent, lend money at high interest, build temples, and set up offices, using iron calculators to exploit the poor. These heartless people drink blood without rinsing their mouths and eat flesh without spitting out bones, yet they chant Buddhist scriptures, saying that poverty and wealth are predetermined by heaven and brought from the womb. I truly hate these class enemies.

In the past, I didn't understand and blamed my mother. How could I blame her? My mother suffered more than I did; she was forced by the landlord to send me to be a child bride. My father-in-law was tortured to death by the landlord; my husband fled to avoid conscription, and my daughter drowned; the scars on my legs... which of these blood debts were not owed by the landlords and Chiang Kai-shek? They caused my entire family to die or flee, leaving only me struggling to survive.

Reading Chairman Mao's books and thinking about my experiences, I finally understood: in the world, people are divided into classes, each with their own thoughts and plans. Whom should we be close to? Whom should we hate? Whom should we be friendly with? Whom should we be harsh with? I also know how to use class analysis to draw the line!

I must hate imperialism, landlords, big bosses, Chiang Kai-shek who fled to Taiwan, and all reactionaries in the world. Just talking about hate is not enough to vent it. How should I fiercely fight against the enemy? The leadership and comrades enlightened me: the parents of these children are fighting against the Americans and Chiang's bandits on the front lines, or fighting against landlords and rich peasants in the countryside. Taking good care of the children and letting their parents fight the enemy without worry is supporting their struggle against the enemy. Oh! My work is indeed important! Also, there are enemies in our thoughts, the old thoughts and habits of selfishness and fatalism in our minds, which are the evil things left by the enemy to prevent us from revolutionizing. I must resolutely drive them out of my mind, letting Chairman Mao's thoughts truly take root.

Towards our own people and comrades, we must emphasize unity. In the nursery, there are so many sisters who have come from all over the country to make the revolution, how can we not be close and friendly?

Without unity among our own people, how can we have the strength to fight the enemy? I followed Chairman Mao's instructions, caring for, loving, and helping each other. The public affairs class's Wong Ailian has a quick temper. When she argues, I feel sad. Chairman Mao said, "Towards comrades, we must be extremely enthusiastic and cannot be indifferent or numb." I must listen to Chairman Mao's words. One evening, I talked to her about my bitter family history, about whom Chairman Mao wants us to hate and love, and we cried together. We must care for each other in thoughts and in life. Ailian's sewing is not good, so I sew a few more shoes at night, helping her children and knitting sweaters for them. In "Care for the People's Livelihood and Pay Attention to Work Methods," Chairman Mao even cares about women learning to plow and give birth. Chairman Mao is teaching us: fate is not determined by heaven but by people. Only by caring for each other and uniting to overthrow the enemy can the poor's fate improve.

Understanding how to care for comrades, I see that there are always things that need my care everywhere. Zhang Liying just joined the work, lacking experience, and couldn't even clean the glass. I helped her do it and taught her how. When she was sick with a high fever, I sent her soup and meals, treating her like my own daughter. Xiaowu's younger brother was going to Xinjiang, so I told him, "No matter how far from home, rely on the Party," and bought him a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to study, telling him to learn from White and Zhang. During the summer vacation, I was given half a month of leave to go home, but the nursery is my home, so I didn't go anywhere, letting other comrades rest for a few more days. Being able to help class sisters do a little is also heartwarming.

Using class perspective to treat people, being friendly to our own people and harsh to the enemy, this is what Chairman Mao taught me.

A Change in Thought Leads to Changes in Everything, Spiritual Power is Boundless

Being a sanitation worker, to do a good job, I must first have a clean mind. In the past, I had many old thoughts. For whom am I a sanitation worker? How can I do a good job? I didn't understand.

Studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" truly helped me get rid of selfishness and open my mind. Dr. Bethune was older than me, crossing mountains and seas to come to China. He, a foreigner, treated China's revolution as his own business, sacrificing himself for China's revolution. He treated the world's revolution as his own business. But what about me, Zheng Chunlan? I treated cleaning the toilets in the same courtyard as an extra job. Thinking about Dr. Bethune and myself, I was truly ashamed. Chairman Mao used Dr. Bethune's example to educate me: all revolutionary work, all work beneficial to the people, are our duties, and we must eagerly take them on. Not only must I do this for life, but I must also educate my descendants to do the same. Doing revolution is not like being a servant in the old society, selling labor for money, nor is it like a partnership, doing a little and expecting a share. Doing revolution is serving the people wholeheartedly, dedicating one's heart and life, and eagerly taking on all work!

Understanding this, I see that there is always work to be done, and I have boundless energy. Cleaning public toilets, I took it on. Hurrying to finish the cleaning work, I rushed to the class to help the children in the small class dress and feed, and help the children in the middle class bathe. Each time, I work for a few dozen minutes, not doing much, but adding a bit of love to the children and being an extra helper for the teachers and aunts, which is also a way to repay Chairman Mao's painstaking education.

Also, in the summer, there are many storms, and in the autumn, there are many typhoons. When the wind and rain come, I can't sit still or sleep peacefully. The sound of wind and rain is like a command, urging me to go to various classes in the nursery to help collect clothes and blankets, help close doors and windows, and not let public property be damaged by the wind and rain.

Revolutionary work, I eagerly take it on, and others also eagerly take it on because we are all reading Chairman Mao's books! A pair of hands can never be idle. A thought arises, and I think of the corner of the courtyard with the wasteland. I picked up the hoe I hadn't used for ten years and started clearing the land, fertilizing, and watering. The children love fresh food, so I planted melons and beans for them; the young people said that garlic is appetizing and disinfecting, so I also planted two rows. For the revolution, I get up early every day to work in the fields, not missing a day in the hottest summer or the coldest winter. In three years, I harvested more than five thousand six hundred pounds of melons, beans, and vegetables. Seeing the children eat the food I planted with my own hands, I truly feel content.

Every day, I get up at four or five in the morning to work in the fields; at six or seven, the small class wakes up to eat, and it's the busiest time; after breakfast, I do the cleaning; then I study Chairman Mao's works for an hour, which is unshakable; in the afternoon, I know which class the children are bathing in and which class needs their blankets sewn, and I go to help; in the evening, I go to the isolation room to take care of the sick children. Speaking of the isolation room, it is far from my dormitory. However, children with measles and chickenpox, fearing infection, are temporarily isolated next to my dormitory. The class can't spare a caregiver, and the leader wants to come for the night shift, but I don't let them. The leader has to manage the entire nursery and can't be bothered with more work, so I take the initiative to bring my bedding and live in the isolation room. Children with infectious diseases have high fevers, cracked lips, nausea from medicine, and some cry and make a fuss because they feel uncomfortable. I feel heartbroken and can't close my eyes all night. Thinking about the children's fathers on the front lines, not fearing hardship or death to protect everyone, if I don't take good care of the children, I will let them down. At this time, I can't sleep anymore, so I hug the sick children, pat and coax them, and walk back and forth in the room. Walking and walking, my eyelids feel heavy, so I quickly think about Dr. Bethune, compare the current situation, Dr. Bethune risked his life to work, and I am just tired and sleepy, what's the big deal? A thought and a comparison, and my spirit comes back. Chairman Mao's books are truly treasures, giving you strength whenever you think of them. When one after another, the sick children's fevers go down, and they say goodbye to me, jumping and laughing back to their classes, my heart truly feels warm.

Eagerly taking on revolutionary work, the more I do, the cleaner my mind becomes, and the more intimate I feel with everyone. The young people call me "Auntie Zheng" one after another, and the children are even sweeter, picking up paper balls on the ground and shouting: "Pick up quickly, quickly, Auntie Zheng is coming to sweep, Auntie Zheng is so hardworking!" Look! Reading Chairman Mao's books makes my thoughts change, my work changes, my attitude towards the children changes. In return, the children's attitude towards me also changes. In a word, everything changes. Truly, one change leads to changes in everything, and the power is boundless.

Thoughts Must Have High Standards, Life Must Have Low Standards

When learning from Lei Feng, a comrade said: "Auntie Zheng, Lei Feng's socks have patches on patches, and your socks are also patched and mended for seven or eight years, not worse than Lei Feng's!" But you can't compare like this. Looking at the surface, both are frugal; digging into the thoughts, they are very different.

In the past, I thought of my salary like this: working for a lifetime, in the old society, I didn't earn a penny. Now that I am liberated, I earn my own salary, so shouldn't I spend it as I like? For the first few years, I bought a lot of things, both thick and thin wool. Later, I stopped buying recklessly, and from my monthly salary, after deducting my son's school fees and living expenses, I saved every penny and stored it in the bank, thinking: "In case of a disaster or illness!" "In case of a change in work!"... Saving money to prevent "in case." Looking at it, such frugality, how can it be compared to Lei Feng? No wonder, Lei Feng read Chairman Mao's books, and I didn't read them at that time.

Chairman Mao said: "China is a big country, but it is still very poor now, and it will take decades to make China rich," "Save every penny for the war and revolutionary cause, for our economic construction." Chairman Mao's meaning of thrift is so broad! A revolutionary's money should be used for the revolution, and every penny should be used where the revolution needs it most. Lei Feng saved money and sent it to his comrade's mother and donated it to the people's commune, which is what Chairman Mao educated.

I want to learn from Lei Feng with action. Going to the bank to save money again, the meaning of saving has completely changed, one is to remember my roots, two is to support the country's socialist construction, and three is to help comrades in need when needed. With these three points, I saved more money and spent less. My only son went to the countryside to work, and he wrote a letter saying his shirt was torn. I told him to patch it a few more times; soon, he wrote another letter asking for a cotton wad. However, at that time, our sanitation team's Yang Guozhen died, leaving her children and grandchildren in difficulty. Guozhen's son was studying in the countryside and also wrote a letter asking for a cotton wad, so I gave him my own, letting the children without a father receive more love from their relatives. I also took eighty yuan from my savings and sent it to Guozhen. She said with tears, "You are truly my sister, thank you!" Thank me for what? If I hadn't read Chairman Mao's books, could I have done this? This should thank Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao taught me to realize: how to spend money is not a small matter. Money is dead, but people are alive. Money has no thoughts, but people spending money have different classes. I am a revolutionary, spending money must be political, and I must not follow the money. I must remove the word "selfishness" and spend money where the revolution needs it most. Later, my son wrote another letter asking for money, saying in the letter: "Mom, our commune is having a pest disaster, I volunteered to invest ten yuan to save the disaster, without consulting your opinion..." Hey! Consult my opinion for what? It's right! I quickly took out twenty yuan of savings and sent it to him to invest, eliminate the pest disaster, and achieve a bumper harvest. Chairman Mao's words, every word must be listened to. Can some be listened to and some not? No! Every word must be listened to and acted upon, that's a good comrade.

Passing on the Red Flag, Let Future Generations Remain Red

In recent years, while studying Chairman Mao's works, I have also heard people talk about opposing revisionism. What is revisionism? After learning and asking, I know: revisionists have some who were not good people from the beginning. They saw that the revolution was victorious, hid their tails, infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, one way in public and another in private, hanging a revolutionary sign while doing things to sabotage the revolution; some came to the revolution with bad roots and didn't want to remove them. After climbing to high positions, obtaining power and enjoying blessings, they forgot the people and the revolution, becoming traitors and wastrels. It is said that the Soviet Union, which has been revolutionary for over forty years, was ruined by this group of bad guys. This group of black hands is now opposing our Communist Party and Chairman Mao, plotting to harm our children and grandchildren, trying to deceive our children into forgetting class suffering and leading them back to the old path, suffering twice. Revisionism is truly rotten to the core!

I also heard: Chairman Mao is worrying about our children and grandchildren! Indeed, in 1964, he called on us to cultivate successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat, letting the revolution remain unchanged in color generation after generation. This call truly resonates with our hearts. I thought: I have experienced both bitterness and sweetness in my life, and comparing them, my heart is clear, I will follow Chairman Mao closely; but the heavy burden of revolution relies on the young and the next generation to carry, and they have not experienced bitterness and sweetness, will they listen to Chairman Mao's words? The old generation must help them solve this problem. My political level is low, and my cultural level is limited, but I must also respond to Chairman Mao's call and do my best.

To oppose revisionism, to teach children not to be influenced by revisionism, where should I start? Thinking and thinking, I thought of Comrade Shi Chuanxiang. Shi Chuanxiang is a good example of our sanitation workers. He not only does not forget labor after becoming a cadre but also educates young people in labor not to forget their roots. He tells young people about the bitterness of the old society, about the evil deeds of the dung boss colluding with the police and lawyers, making young people raise their class consciousness, throw away the old thoughts of fearing to be sanitation workers, and willingly become revolutionary sanitation workers' successors.

Shi Chuanxiang's method is good. Lei Feng also tells children about his family history. I also want to find time to tell the children about the past. I told them about being born and nearly eaten by a dog, being a child bride with pus-filled sores, having no money to buy medicine and rotting, being beaten by the landlord's wife at the age of six or seven, covering myself with rags, and burning myself by the fire. The children cried with red eyes, saying they want to "overthrow the landlords and American bastards, avenge Auntie Zheng!"

The children live in sweetness, not knowing how to cherish a grain of rice or a thread of cloth, so I showed them my socks worn for over ten years and clothes mended with thousands of stitches, and told them the story of Chairman Mao's hard work and simplicity. Chairman Mao, in his report in Yan'an, stood in the sun, wearing coarse cloth pants with a big patch; the old enamel cup he used to drink water was also used during the Long March. Chairman Mao is the great savior of the Chinese people, always closely united with workers and poor peasants. The children are very obedient, wholeheartedly learning from Chairman Mao, knowing how to cherish the fruits of labor of farmer uncles and worker aunts.

In our nursery, a few comrades went to the countryside to participate in the socialist education movement, leaving their children without care. Children without supervision become lazy and pick up some bad thoughts and habits, what should we do? On weekends, I go to see them, supervising the children to sweep the floor and wipe the glass, cultivating the habit of loving labor. I also help them sew and mend while telling them stories. I know their mothers suffered from a young age and joined the Eighth Route Army at the age of ten or eleven, so I tell them to learn from their mothers' good examples and become revolutionaries. For half a year, I go every weekend.

Closely following Chairman Mao, cultivating revolutionary successors, I have two understandings: first, listen to Chairman Mao's words, see good examples and learn from them, set good examples for the younger generation, pass on the red flag, and let future generations remain red. Second, don't be afraid of not being able to do big things, but in one small thing after another, care for and work hard for the children, using my sweat drop by drop to nurture these young socialist sprouts, letting them take root firmly and deeply, so that no matter what tricks revisionism plays, our children will not be deceived.

---

I have been reading Chairman Mao's books for a short time and have read very few. If you ask me to talk about my experience, to be honest, I can't. I only know that a person like me, despite suffering for thirty years in the old society and receiving the great kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao in the new society, if I don't study Chairman Mao's works, I will only be an old fool, living in comfort without knowing it, enjoying the fruits of the revolution's victory, and not being able to do beneficial work for the revolution. Reading Chairman Mao's books, I feel my mind is clear, my eyes are bright, my heart is broad, and my revolutionary spirit is great. I will follow Chairman Mao closely, follow him tightly, follow him to the end, and follow him for life.

Now, Deng Tuo and others, those bad guys from the "Three Family Village" and "Four Family Shop," who in the old society didn't drink enough of the poor people's blood, are still doing ghostly deeds in human skin, opposing the Party Central Committee, opposing Chairman Mao, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, trying to make us slaves again. They are truly crazy dogs eating the sun, not knowing the height of the sky or the depth of the earth. We must expose them all, uproot their old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits that harm people, and resolutely defend the Party Central Committee, defend Chairman Mao, and defend the great socialist motherland!

Long live the Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao!

专栏：

    毛主席的话，句句都听，句句照办
    东海舰队保育院清洁员　郑春兰
    《解放军报》编者按：东海舰队保育院清洁员郑春兰的这篇学习心得，字字说出了心里话，句句充满对毛主席的衷心爱戴，是工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作的又一篇好文章。
    郑春兰对毛主席的书无限热爱。她在旧社会过了三十年泡在泪水里的苦日子。她感激共产党、毛主席给她带来了幸福生活。她识字很少，今年已经四十七岁。但是，她懂得了毛主席的书是给穷人写的书，是闹革命的书，就一个字一个字地认，一遍一遍地抄，下定决心读一辈子毛主席的书，一辈子步步紧跟毛主席。
    郑春兰对毛主席的话无限忠诚。毛主席的话，她句句都听，句句照办。她读了毛主席的书，就坚决照做，大除私心，大开脑筋。思想一变，带动万变。她掏尽红心干革命，浑身有用不完的力气。在她眼里，到处都是应该干的活，只要对革命有利，都当作自己份内的事，都抢着干。她不但自己见好样子就学，而且处处给下一代做好样子，把红旗传下去，让子孙万代红。
    我们每个干部战士，都应当象郑春兰那样，认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，句句都听，句句照办；步步紧跟毛主席，跟得紧，跟到底，跟一辈子。
    我这样一个在旧社会差一点被狗吃掉的人，今天能来讲讲自己的学习心得，没有共产党，没有毛主席，根本办不到！不解放，我这个人谁知道还能不能活着！
    四十七年前，我生在浙江兰溪乡下。贫农家里穷，养不活女儿，我才四个月的时候，妈就把我送给人家当了童养媳。在婆家，我六七岁就跟着干杂活，烧饭，起早搭黑地劳动；十二三岁时，婆婆病死了，全家人身上的衣裳、脚上的鞋，好好赖赖靠我一根针维持。十七岁成亲，第二年丈夫躲壮丁，一去好几年没音讯；老公爹瘫痪在床，没钱医治，活活病死；头生女去挖野菜，掉到河里淹死；我也得了瘟疫，死过去好几次，死不掉，又活了过来。没几年，婆家、娘家十来口人，叫旧社会吃掉八口，剩下我孤苦伶仃，只好离开家乡，给大老板当佣人。前前后后三十年，我是年年月月泡在泪水里过日子，成天只有哭，满心只有恨，恨世道不公，哭自己命苦。
    解放啦！苦日子算是熬出了头，生活安定，儿子上中学。我也有了工作，在东海舰队保育院当清洁员，一个月工资好几十元，吃不愁，花不尽，单的棉的、毛衣毛裤，添置得齐齐全全。我心里想：可要好好跟着共产党、毛主席走，为党多出力气啊！
    读毛主席的书，走雷锋的路
    一九六三年春天，广播里天天说雷锋，孩子们天天唱雷锋。雷锋是个什么人啊？毛主席都题了词，要大家学习他哩！有一天，协理员叫我去大礼堂听报告，作报告的是雷锋那个班的班长。听人家一谈才明白：雷锋是毛主席的好战士，他做的好事，箩筐装不尽，汽车拉不完。他呀，同我一样，在旧社会也是一个死里逃生的受苦人。我们岁数有大小，可都是一根苦藤上结的瓜呀。
    那天晚上，我睡在床上翻来复去闭不上眼，总是在想：我和雷锋，都是共产党、毛主席从苦海里搭救出来的人。雷锋不忘党，事事为党出力气，毛主席都夸他是个好样子；我要多为党出力气，就要做雷锋一样的人。比起雷锋，旧社会的苦，我比他受得多，新社会的甜，我比他尝得多，为什么对革命的贡献就没有他多？雷锋的好事一千条、一万条，是谁教他做的？雷锋最爱读毛主席的书，把毛主席著作当作粮食、武器和方向盘，毛主席怎么说他就怎么做，所以做出来的事件件叫人夸。我差雷锋一千条、一万条，根本的一条就差在没读毛主席的书上。
    读毛主席的书，一九六○年以后，领导上多次向我提过。可我那时想的是：自己岁数大啦，当个清洁员，又不是干部，用不着管人，不读不是也一样工作吗？幸亏雷锋同志提醒了我：毛主席的书是穷人的书，是革命的书，读了就能革命到底，不读就要糊涂一辈子。雷锋也不是干部，是一个汽车司机，学了毛主席著作，就做出数不尽的好事。对！我郑春兰要为党多出力气，头一条先得把毛主席的书读好。
    捧起毛主席的书来，一块大石头把路挡住了——我没有文化呀！一九五九年上夜校，我念完了一册语文课本，后来夜校停了，识的几个字也跟着丢了。早知道今天要读毛主席的书，再苦再难也不能把它丢下。自己不识字，只得请协理员和同志们念给我听，可是这不是长久的办法。我就拜年轻人做老师，拿毛主席的书当教材，又学文化又学政治。
    这时清洁组来了一位新同志张丽英，是高小毕业的学生。我们订了“一对红”条件，我帮她熟悉工作，她教我学习文化。我对丽英说：“旧社会不光害得我家破人亡，还害得我三代人都是‘睁眼瞎子’。不识字，读不了毛主席的书，你好好教我吧，对我要求严格一些，教不好你要负责，学不好我要检讨。为了革命，我们一道搬掉没文化这座山吧！”丽英是个热心的姑娘，一个字一个字地教我念《为人民服务》，日子一长，我认得的字就多了，毛主席的话记住的也多了。
    看见小朋友们拿格子纸学写字，我不服老，跟他们一道抄写毛主席语录。“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。……”抄一遍，认一遍，这几个字，我就抄了几十遍，认了几十遍。白天工作忙，都是晚上学呀写的。我这双眼睛不怎么管用了。在旧社会哭得快瞎了，字写小了笔画看不清，灯光刺久了还泪糊糊的。怎么办？放下毛主席的书不读不写？不能啊！人家雷锋读毛主席的书就没有困难？开车在外边，停下他就读；回到连里，晚上一读就到十一点钟；连烧开水的时候，还要就着灶火读。要学雷锋好样子，读毛主席的书，就不能怕眼睛疼。倒是同志们提醒我，花几元钱配了一副老光镜子，每天晚上戴起来，清清亮亮地好学习。
    毛主席号召我学雷锋，雷锋又领着我学毛主席著作。学习毛主席著作，拣起了文化学习，学文化又帮助我更好地读毛主席的书。我下定决心，这后半辈子，要读毛主席的书，走雷锋的路，做一个有新思想、新文化的新妇女。
    一定要懂得阶级和阶级斗争
    打开毛主席的书，第一篇学的就是《中国社会各阶级的分析》。
    我受了半辈子穷，只当是命苦，也不知道苦根在哪里；有时怨恨世道不公，可总以为世道是老天爷安排定了的。说来都好笑，我还恨过我妈妈，恨妈不该送我去当童养媳，让我三十年苦泪成河。
    毛主席的书教我明白过来了：不是什么八字不好命运苦，没有什么观音菩萨老天爷，穷根苦根就在“阶级”两个字上。都是大地主、大资本家同帝国主义串通一气，剥削我们，才压得我们工人、贫下中农活不下去。他们为了把谷仓填满，把腰包装肥，就收租粮，放高利贷，立祠堂，办衙门，打着铁算盘剥削我们穷人。这帮黑心的家伙，喝了人血不漱嘴，吃了人肉不吐骨头，还一口一声地念佛经，说穷富自有天定命定，是从娘胎里带来的。我真恨死这些阶级敌人了。
    过去不明白，恨过我妈妈。我怎么能恨妈妈呢？妈妈比我更苦，她是让地主逼得活不下去，才送我去当童养媳的。老公爹是地主折磨死的；丈夫躲壮丁，女儿被淹死，我腿上的伤疤……哪一笔血泪债不是地主、蒋介石欠下的？他们害得我全家死的死，逃的逃，只剩下我一个人苦苦地挣扎着活命。
    读了毛主席的书，想想经历过的事，我才明白过来：世界上人千人万，论阶级是一分两边，各有各的心思，各有各的打算。应该对谁亲？对谁恨？对谁和？对谁狠？我也知道用阶级分析的方法来划线啦！
    恨，就要恨帝国主义，恨地主大老板，恨逃到台湾去的蒋介石，恨世上一切反动派。光说恨，不能解恨。我该怎样狠狠地斗敌人呢？领导和同志们又启发我：眼前这些孩子的爹妈，有的在前线斗美帝，斗蒋贼，有的在乡下斗地富反坏。带好孩子，让爹妈们安心，就是支援他们同敌人斗争。噢！我这工作还真要紧哩！还有，思想上也有敌人呐，脑子里自私自利、听天由命的旧思想、旧习惯，不就是敌人留下不让我好好革命的坏东西吗？我要下狠心从脑子里把它们赶走，好让毛主席的思想真正扎根。
    对自己人，对同志，可要讲团结。保育院里这么多姐妹，都是为了闹革命，从五湖四海走到一起来的，怎么能不亲不和呢？
    自己人不团结，哪来力量斗敌人呢？我就照着毛主席的指示去做，和大家互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。公务班的翁阿莲脾气躁，她一吵，我就难过。毛主席说过，对同志要极端的热忱，不能漠不关心，麻木不仁。我要听毛主席的话。一天晚上，我找她谈起血泪家史，谈起毛主席要我们恨谁爱谁，谈到贴心处，两个人抱头大哭一场。思想上要关心，生活上也要关心。阿莲的针线活差些，我就夜里少睡一会儿，给她孩子纳鞋底，帮她孩子织毛线衣。毛主席在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》里边，连我们妇女学犁耙、生小孩的事都关心到了。毛主席这是在教育我们：命不是天定，是由人定；只有穷人互相关心，齐心把敌人打倒，穷人的命才能变好。
    懂得了应当关心同志，就到处都能看到要你关心的事情。张丽英刚参加工作，没经验，玻璃也擦不干净，我就帮她做，教她做；她病了，发高烧，我送汤送饭，把她当成亲女儿。小吴的弟弟要去新疆，我就告诉他，离家千万里，靠在党身边，还买了一本《毛泽东著作选读》送他，叫他好好学习白求恩、张思德。暑假里给我半个月假期，叫我回家，保育院就是我的家，我哪里也没去，替换着让别的同志多休息几天。能帮阶级姐妹做点事，自己心里也觉着舒坦。
    拿阶级眼光看待人，对自己人和，对敌人狠，这是毛主席教会我的。
    思想一变带万变，精神力量大无边
    当个清洁员，要把清洁工作做好，先得思想清洁。我过去有不少旧思想。为谁当清洁员？怎样才算做好了清洁工作？不明白。
    学习《纪念白求恩》，真是大除私心，大开脑筋。白求恩大夫年岁比我还大，翻山过海来到了中国。他一个外国人，把中国革命的事当成自己的事，为了中国革命，牺牲在中国。他把世界革命的事，都当成自己份内的事。可我郑春兰呢？把打扫同院的厕所还当成份外的事。想想白求恩大夫，想想我自己，真是羞死人了。毛主席拿白求恩大夫这个好样子教育了我：凡是革命工作，凡是对人民有利的事，都是份内事，都要抢着干。不光自己要这样干一辈子，还要教育子子孙孙这样干下去。干革命绝不是在旧社会给谁当佣工，论钱卖力；也不是合伙做买卖，干一点非得分红。干革命，是全心全意为人民服务，要掏尽红心干，要豁出性命干，一切工作抢着干！
    想透了这层道理，满眼都是应该干的活，浑身有用不完的力气。打扫公共厕所，我包了。紧赶慢赶搞完清洁工作，就往班上跑，给小班孩子穿衣喂饭，帮中班孩子洗澡。每次干几十分钟，也干不了什么大事，不过给孩子添一分疼爱，让老师阿姨多个帮手，也算是报答毛主席对我的苦心教育啊！还有，夏天暴雨多，秋天台风多，风雨一来，我就坐不安，睡不宁。风雨声就象是命令，催我到院里各班去打个转，帮着收衣被，帮着关门窗，不让公家的东西受风雨糟蹋。
    革命工作，我抢着干，别人也抢着干，大家都在读毛主席的书嘛！一双手总是不能闲着。心一动，想到了院子角那片荒地。我就扛起丢下十来年的锄头，开荒翻地，施肥浇水。孩子们爱吃新鲜，我就给他们种瓜点豆；年轻人说大蒜开胃消毒，我也给种上两畦。为革命搞生产，每天提早起床去下地，三伏数九都不误。三年光景，收了五千六百多斤瓜豆菜蔬。看见孩子们吃上我亲手种的东西，我心里真感到舒坦。
    我每天清早四五点钟下地劳动；六点多，小小班起床吃饭，最忙不过；早饭后，搞清洁；接着学一个钟头毛主席著作，那是雷打不动的；下午，哪个班孩子洗澡，哪个班洗了被子要缝，我都摸得清楚，赶得去；到晚上，便去隔离室招呼招呼小病号。说起隔离室，本来离开我的宿舍老远。不过小朋友害了水痘、麻疹，怕传染，总是临时隔离在我宿舍旁边。班里抽不出保育员，院领导要来值夜班，我不让。领导要管全院的事，不能再让她们多劳神，我就抢先抱着被子住进去。害了传染病的孩子，有的发高烧烧得嘴唇裂缝，有的吃药恶心了乱吐，有的身上难过又哭又吵，我心疼得整夜闭不上眼睛。一想到孩子的爸爸在前方，不怕苦、不怕死保卫大家，带不好孩子，对不住他们。这时候，我也顾不得再睡觉了，抱起病孩子，拍拍哄哄，满屋子来回走动。走着走着，眼皮发粘了，我赶紧想想白求恩大夫，比比眼前的情况，白求恩大夫豁出性命干工作，我累点困点算得了什么？一想一比精神就来了。毛主席的书真是宝，什么时候想到都能给你力量。等到一个个小病号退了烧，喊一声“郑阿姨再见”，活蹦乱跳地回班上去的时候，我心里真是暖烘烘的。
    革命工作抢着干，越干思想越清洁，和大家也越见亲热了。年轻人一口一声“郑阿姨”，小朋友心更甜，地上有了纸团抢着拣，嘴里还嚷着：“快拣快拣，郑阿姨又要来扫了，郑阿姨多辛苦呀！”看！读毛主席的书，使我思想变了，工作变了，对孩子们的态度变了。反过来，孩子们对我的态度也变了。一句话，一切都变了。真是一变带万变，力量大无边。
    思想要讲高标准，生活要讲低标准
    学雷锋的时候，有同志说了：“郑阿姨，雷锋的袜子补钉摞补钉，你的袜子也缝缝补补七八年了，比雷锋也不差呀！”可不能这么比。光看表面，都是节省；挖挖思想，可大不一样。
    早先我是这样看待工资的：劳动一辈子，旧社会拿不到一分钱。现在解放了，自己挣的工资嘛，还不该自己花？爱怎么花就怎么花。头几年，我买了不少东西，毛线粗的细的都买了个齐全。后来不再乱买，一个月工资，除去供儿子念书和伙食费，余下的一角一分都存银行，心想：“万一有个灾病呢！”“万一工作有变动呢！”……存钱好防“万一”。看看，这样的节省，怎么能和雷锋比？也难怪，雷锋读了毛主席的书，我那时还没读嘛。
    毛主席说：“中国是一个大国，但是现在还很穷，要使中国富起来，需要几十年时间”，“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设”。毛主席讲的这个勤俭节约，意思多宽呀！革命人的钱，要用来为革命服务，每一个铜板都要用在革命最需要的地方。雷锋把钱省下来，寄给同志的妈妈，献给人民公社，就是毛主席教育出来的。
    我要拿行动学习雷锋。再去银行存钱，存的意思全都变了，一是为的自己不忘本，二是为的支援国家的社会主义建设，三是为的有需要时可以发扬阶级友爱，帮助同志解决一点困难。有了这三条，我存的钱更多了，花的钱更少了。独养儿子下乡劳动，来信说衬衣破了，我叫他再打几层补钉；不久，他又来信要个棉花胎。可是，就在那几天，我们清洁组的杨国珍死了丈夫，拖儿带女的，手上很困难。国珍的儿子在乡下念书，也写信来要棉花胎，我就把自己的一床给了他，让没了爸爸的孩子多得到一些亲人疼爱。我还从储蓄的钱里取出八十元送给国珍。她泪花花地说：“你真是我的亲姐妹，谢谢你啊！”谢我干什么？不是读了毛主席的书，我能这么办吗？这要谢毛主席啊！
    毛主席教我觉悟到：怎么花钱，不是一件小事情。钱是死的，人是活的，钱没有思想，花钱的人可各有各的阶级。我是个革命人，花钱要讲政治，绝不能人随钱变，要挖掉一个“私”字，把钱花在革命最需要的地方。后来我儿子又写信要钱，信上说：“妈妈，我们公社闹虫灾，我自报投资十元救灾，没有征求你的意见……”嘿！还征求我什么意见？办得对嘛！我赶忙取出二十元存款，寄了去叫他投资，消灭虫灾，夺个丰收。毛主席的话，句句都要听。能不能有的听，有的不听？不能！句句都听，句句照办，才是好同志。
    把红旗传下去，让子孙万代红
    这些年，一边学毛主席著作，一边听人谈论反对修正主义。修正主义是个什么东西？一学一问才知道：修正主义分子有一些原先就不是好人，他们看到革命胜利了，夹起狐狸尾巴，混进革命队伍，阴一套，阳一套，挂起革命招牌，干破坏革命的事；还有一些是带着坏根子来革命的，到了革命队伍，坏根子又不肯除掉，职位爬高了，得了权，享了福，就忘了人民，忘了革命，变成叛徒败家子。听说革命四十多年的苏联，就是被这帮坏家伙给祸害了。这伙黑帮，如今反对我们共产党、毛主席，想打我们子孙后代的坏主意，想骗得我们的孩子忘掉阶级苦，牵着我们的孩子走回头路，受二遍苦。修正主义真是坏得流脓啦！
    我又听说：毛主席在为子孙万代操心呐！果然，一九六四年，他老人家号召要培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，让革命世世代代不变颜色。这个号召真是说到我们心里来了。我心想：我这一辈子，苦和甜都尝过，一比心里就明白，跟毛主席是跟定了；可是革命的重担子要靠年轻人和下一代挑，他们没有苦和甜的对比，会不会听毛主席的话呢？老一辈就要帮他们解决这个问题。我政治水平低，文化水平有限，也要响应毛主席的号召，尽心尽力去做才是。
    要反对修正主义，要教孩子们不沾一点修正主义，该从哪里下手呢？想来想去，想到了时传祥同志。时传祥是我们清洁工的好样子，他不光是当了干部不忘劳动，还在劳动里教育小青年不忘本。他给年轻人讲旧社会的苦，讲粪霸勾结警察老爷、律师老爷杀人喝血的罪恶，讲得年轻人提高了阶级觉悟，扔掉了怕当掏粪工人的旧思想，甘心做个革命清洁工的接班人。
    时传祥的这个办法好。雷锋不是也给小朋友讲家史吗？我也要抽空给孩子们讲讲过去。我把生出来差一点给恶狗吃掉，当童养媳长脓包疮，没钱买药烂得发臭，六七岁挨地主婆毒打，盖破烂被子，烤火烫得皮焦肉烂的事情一说，孩子们哭得眼睛红红的，说要“打倒地主、美国佬大坏蛋，给郑阿姨报仇！”
    孩子们泡在蜜糖里过日子，不知爱惜一米一线，我就把穿了十来年的袜子，和补过千针百线的衣裳给他们看，又讲毛主席艰苦朴素的故事给他们听。毛主席在延安作报告，就站在太阳地里，穿着粗布裤，补个老大的补钉；喝水用的旧搪瓷缸子，还是长征路上用过的。毛主席是中国人民的大救星，总是紧紧和工人、贫下中农心贴心站在一起。孩子们真听话，一心学习毛主席，知道爱惜农民伯伯、工人阿姨的劳动果实了。
    我们院里，有几个同志去农村参加社会主义教育运动了，家里小孩没人照应。孩子没人管教，懒散了，沾上些坏思想、坏习气，可怎么好？遇上星期天，我就去看看，督促孩子动手拖地板、擦玻璃，养成爱劳动的习惯。我还一边帮他们缝缝补补，一边给他们讲故事。我知道他们的妈妈从小受苦，十几岁就投奔了八路军，要他们学妈妈的好样子，做革命人。半年多了，每个星期天都去。
    紧紧跟着毛主席，培养革命接班人，我有两条体会：第一是要听毛主席的话，见了好样子就要学，处处给年青一代做好样子，把红旗传下去，让子孙万代红。第二是不要怕大事做不来，要在一件一件小事上为孩子操心出力气，用自己一点一滴的汗水，勤浇这些社会主义的嫩苗，让他们根子扎正扎深，任凭修正主义出什么鬼点子，也不让我们的孩子上当。
       ×    ×     ×
    我读毛主席的书，时间还很短，书也读得很少。要我讲经验，说老实话，我是讲不来的。我只晓得，象我这样一个人，尽管在旧社会受了三十年苦，尽管在新社会得到党和毛主席天大的恩情，如果不学习毛主席著作，就只会是个老糊涂，身在福中不知福，坐享革命的胜利果实，不能给革命做有益的工作。读了毛主席的书，我觉得我的头脑清醒了，眼睛亮了，心胸宽了，革命干劲也大了。我要步步紧跟毛主席，跟得紧，跟到底，跟一辈子。
    现在，邓拓等等那些“三家村”“四家店”的坏家伙们，在旧社会喝穷人的血没喝够，还在那里披着人皮做鬼事，反对党中央，反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，想叫我们再当牛做马。真是疯狗吃太阳，不晓得天高地厚。我们要把他们统统揪出来，把他们拿来害人的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯连根拔掉，坚决保卫党中央，保卫毛主席，保卫伟大的社会主义祖国！
    共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
