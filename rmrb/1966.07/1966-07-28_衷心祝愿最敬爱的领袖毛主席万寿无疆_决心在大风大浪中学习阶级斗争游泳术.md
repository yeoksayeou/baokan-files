The entire nation, both military and civilian, is spreading the joyous news of Chairman Mao's swimming across the Yangtze River with the most affectionate and excited hearts. They sincerely wish our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, a long life. They are determined to learn the art of swimming in the stormy seas of class struggle.

People everywhere are expressing their resolve to advance along the red path opened by Chairman Mao, fearing no hardships and no sacrifices, and to fight to the end against U.S. imperialism in the struggle to aid Vietnam and resist America. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they are determined to sweep away all monsters and demons.

A Xinhua News Agency report dated July 27th states: The joyous news of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao swimming across the Yangtze River has greatly inspired people across the country. In recent days, the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao a long life!" have echoed through cities and villages across the nation. People have expressed their determination to forever study Chairman Mao's great revolutionary theories and practices, to forever follow Chairman Mao, to forever follow the Party, and to bravely advance in the great storms of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation.

Chairman Mao said: The Yangtze River, everyone says it is very big, but in fact, big is not to be feared. Isn't U.S. imperialism very big? We stood up to it and it was nothing. Therefore, some big things in the world are actually not to be feared. Chairman Mao's teachings have particularly inspired the people of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan, who are on the front lines of aiding Vietnam and resisting America. People have expressed their determination to fear no hardships and no sacrifices, to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, and to fight to the end against U.S. imperialism in the struggle to aid Vietnam and resist America.

In early January 1958, Chairman Mao swam in the Yu River in Nanning, setting a shining example of fearlessness against cold winds and waves for the people here. Under Chairman Mao's great call to swim in rivers, lakes, and seas, and to train in the great storms, the number of people participating in swimming exercises in the Nanning area has increased dramatically, from tens of thousands each year in the past to over 2.3 million last year. After the joyous news of Chairman Mao swimming across the Yangtze River reached Nanning, the broad masses of militia, students, cadres, and residents were inspired and expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to further train their swimming skills, and to be ready to respond to the country's call to contribute to aiding Vietnam and resisting America. Students and teachers from ten ethnic groups—Zhuang, Han, Yao, Miao, Dong, Hui, Mao Nanh, Ge Lao, Yi, and Water—at the Guangxi Nationalities Institute wrote a letter to Chairman Mao expressing their infinite love and admiration. They wrote in the letter, "We wish you to be like the evergreen pine on the mountain, forever youthful; like the sun in the sky, forever shining brightly." They said, "Your feat of swimming across the Yangtze River is a great inspiration to us. We are determined to follow your teachings and grow in the great storms of revolution. We, who are on the front lines of aiding Vietnam and resisting America, are ready to respond to the country's call and fight side by side with the Vietnamese brothers to strike down the American aggressors."

In Kunming, after hearing the news of Chairman Mao swimming across the Yangtze River, many classes and departments of Yunnan University immediately organized swimming activities. They expressed their determination to learn various skills to fight the enemy and to advance with Chairman Mao in the great storms. Wang Chunfu, the director of Alala Brigade in Alala Commune on the outskirts of Kunming, said, "Chairman Mao's fearlessness in swimming in the Yangtze River has greatly inspired us poor and lower-middle peasants. We feel that as long as we have the Party and Chairman Mao's leadership, no storm is to be feared."

In Guangzhou, after hearing the news of Chairman Mao swimming across the Yangtze River, the broad masses of militia in various factories, schools, and people's communes could not help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Yang Xiaomei, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a five-good militia member at Huangpu Shipyard, said, "Seeing Chairman Mao so healthy makes me very happy. I will definitely use Chairman Mao's thoughts to arm my mind, to be in the workshop but with the country in my heart and the world in my eyes, to contribute to supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and to the world revolution."

In Hunan, people are spreading the joyous news of Chairman Mao swimming across the Yangtze River with the most affectionate and excited hearts. In Chairman Mao's hometown of Shaoshan, people were particularly happy to hear the news. Zhou Baochen, a 74-year-old old revolutionary who participated in the Great Revolution, said, "Chairman Mao's health is our greatest happiness." Liu Xue'e, a 20-year-old party branch secretary of Tiepi Brigade in Shaoshan Commune, said, "Chairman Mao's swimming across the Yangtze River not only strengthens our ability to overcome difficulties but also points the direction for our training. We must train not only our bodies but also our firm and correct political direction in the great storms, so as to become the vanguard of the three great revolutionary movements and the successors of the red revolutionary cause." Every evening, the place where Chairman Mao swam in his youth is filled with young people swimming, determined to master swimming skills in the place where Chairman Mao swam. Workers of the Hunan Rubber Factory, a model enterprise in the style of Daqing, immediately organized over 500 workers to swim across the Xiang River after hearing the news, responding to Chairman Mao's call with actual actions. Before diving into the water, they read again the report of Chairman Mao swimming across the Yangtze River and unanimously expressed their determination to swim not only in rivers but also to follow Chairman Mao in the great storms of class struggle forever.

The joyous news of Chairman Mao swimming across the Yangtze River reached Sichuan Province, inspiring heroes of war, labor models in industry and agriculture, five-good athletes, and young students. Luo Shifa, a representative of the National People's Congress and party committee secretary of Xinmin Commune in Xindu County, who has seen Chairman Mao many times, said, "Chairman Mao always teaches us in leading the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, 'To be determined, to fear no sacrifice, to overcome all difficulties, and to strive for victory.' In the past, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, displayed great revolutionary spirit, and overthrew the three big mountains oppressing the Chinese people, establishing New China. After liberation, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, with the spirit of moving mountains, fearing no hardships, fighting against nature, transforming fields, and building basic farmland facilities, thus continuously increasing grain production. In the future, we will read Chairman Mao's books better, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, closely follow Chairman Mao, and build socialist new villages." Wang Suzhen, a representative of the National People's Congress and a five-good parachutist who broke the world record five times, said, "We followed Chairman Mao's teachings of daring to struggle and daring to win, using only half a year to practice jumping 300 times, breaking the record held by foreigners for six years with over 1,000 practices. This proves that as long as we listen to Chairman Mao's words and act with great revolutionary spirit, daring to climb the highest peaks, we can create miracles."

Students of Sichuan University also expressed their determination to follow the red path opened by Chairman Mao, to train in the great storms of rivers, lakes, and seas, and to train in the great storms of class struggle, forging a healthy body and a firm revolutionary will, and becoming good successors of the revolutionary cause.

The joyous news of Chairman Mao swimming across the Yangtze River reached Harbin in Northeast China, inspiring the workers of Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works. This factory's mechanical workshop has a heavy production task in July, originally estimated to complete only 70 to 80 percent of the plan. Now the workers express their determination to complete the plan with the spirit of breaking waves, to temper their will and courage in the face of arduous tasks, and to definitely achieve double victories in the Cultural Revolution and production. Since July 26th, the entire workshop has launched a labor competition. On the first day of the competition, many workers improved tools and operating methods, completing 13 to 20 hours of work in just 8 hours. Wang Shumei, a speed skater of China, jumped up excitedly after hearing the news of Chairman Mao swimming across the Yangtze River. She said, "At a time when international and domestic class struggles are fierce and complex, the news of Chairman Mao swimming across the Yangtze River has further inspired our determination and confidence to fight against all monsters and demons at home and abroad. We must learn the art of swimming in the storms of class struggle."

In Taiyuan, workers of the Shanxi Daily Printing Plant, after seeing the news and photos of Chairman Mao swimming across the Yangtze River, expressed their determination to use Chairman Mao's books as the guiding direction for all actions, to learn Chairman Mao's great revolutionary spirit, and to be the main force in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The news reached the Taihang Mountains area of Changzhi City, and Wang Shangzhi, secretary of the CPC Jin Dongnan Regional Committee, and deputy secretary Tongyun, immediately held a meeting with over 300 young swimming enthusiasts and swam together. The young people expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to train in the great storms, and to become strong successors of the proletariat.

The joyous news of Chairman Mao swimming across the Yangtze River also greatly inspired the broad masses of cadres and commune members in the countryside of Hebei Province. Xie Junxiao, a commune member of Liuzhuang Brigade in Xizhuang Commune of Ding County, said, "A revolutionary can only grow in the great storms. In the future, I will not only study Chairman Mao's great revolutionary theories but also learn Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practices. I will closely follow Chairman Mao and advance bravely in the great storms." Many cadres and commune members held meetings, expressing their determination to display great revolutionary spirit and to sweep away all monsters and demons. They said: With Chairman Mao at the helm, the Chinese revolution will definitely overcome all difficulties and advance from victory to victory.

The joyous news of Chairman Mao swimming across the Yangtze River greatly inspired the soldiers of the Second Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army guarding the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. They sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life and are determined to forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao, forever advancing with Chairman Mao in the great storms.
