Loyal to the Party, Loyal to the People, Loyal to Chairman Mao, Loyal to Mao Zedong Thought

The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army calls for the promotion and study of the activities of Liu Yingjun

	Truly regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive for all actions, and carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works more deeply, more solidly, and more effectively. Cultivate more comrades like Lei Feng, Ou Yanghai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Liu Yingjun who are good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

	Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a notice on July 14th, calling for the widespread promotion and study of the activities of Comrade Liu Yingjun throughout the army. The full text of the notice is as follows:

	Comrade Liu Yingjun, a soldier in the artillery company of a certain unit in the Shenyang Military Region, sacrificed his life on March 15th of this year to protect the lives of the people. This is another hero like Ou Yanghai in our army, and another great communist warrior like Lei Feng and Wang Jie in our era.

	Comrade Liu Yingjun truly did "read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." He loves the Party and Chairman Mao infinitely, and strives to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. He focuses on the "application" aspect. He has a clear class and class struggle perspective, stands firm, and is clear about his likes and dislikes. He maintains a high level of revolutionary vigilance against domestic and foreign class enemies. He strictly demands of himself, is rich in self-criticism, and seriously engages in self-transformation, gradually establishing a proletarian worldview. In revolutionary practice, he trains himself diligently, consciously does a lot of good deeds for the company and the people, and is willing to be an unnamed hero. He insists on the direction of emphasizing politics, resists the influence of purely military views, actively engages in political and ideological work, and strives to contribute to the revolutionary construction of the company. He uses various opportunities and methods to enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the heroic and exemplary figures armed with Mao Zedong Thought in the company and among the people. In carrying out cultural activities within the company, he effectively implements the policy of using literature and art to serve proletarian politics and to consolidate and enhance the combat effectiveness of the troops. He actively participates in the class struggle in the ideological realm and resolutely criticizes the anti-party and anti-socialist crimes of representatives of the bourgeoisie.

	Comrade Liu Yingjun appeared in the new situation where the Central Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao called on the army to emphasize politics, launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive for all work in the army. Comrade Liu Yingjun responded to the call to regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive with his actions. His main characteristics are: striving to study the highest directive, faithfully executing the highest directive, enthusiastically propagating the highest directive, and bravely defending the highest directive. He is a model executor of the highest directive and a model for all comrades in the army to learn from.

	Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being carried out vigorously in our country. The Party Central Committee calls on us: we must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always emphasize politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The Central Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao call on us to vigorously implement the five principles of emphasizing politics. Promoting and studying the activities of Comrade Liu Yingjun throughout the army is of great significance for better implementing the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the Military Commission, and Comrade Lin Biao, for encouraging the cadres and soldiers of the army to more actively participate in the Cultural Revolution, and for promoting the revolutionary construction of the army and strengthening preparedness.

	The General Political Department requires all comrades in the army to learn from the excellent qualities of Comrade Liu Yingjun. The main focus is to learn from his loyalty to the Party, the people, Chairman Mao, and Mao Zedong Thought, and to consciously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect, learning in struggle, and using in struggle, regarding the dissemination and implementation of Mao Zedong Thought as a lifelong career. All comrades in the army should, like Comrade Liu Yingjun, truly regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive for all actions.

	The General Political Department requires all units to organize all cadres and soldiers to seriously study and discuss the model deeds, diary excerpts, and relevant articles in newspapers and magazines of Comrade Liu Yingjun. Unit newspapers should actively promote this. Literary creation and cultural activities should actively cooperate. The promotion and study of the activities of Comrade Liu Yingjun should be closely linked with the current domestic and international class struggle situation, closely linked with the tasks and actual thoughts of the unit, and closely linked with the promotion and study of good deeds in the unit. Through the promotion and study of Comrade Liu Yingjun, carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works more deeply, more solidly, and more effectively, and cultivate more comrades like Lei Feng, Ou Yanghai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Liu Yingjun who are good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

      沈阳部队某部炮连战士刘英俊，于今年三月十五日，为保卫人民群众的生命安全英勇牺牲。这是我军又一个欧阳海式的英雄人物，是我们时代又一个雷锋、王杰式的伟大的共产主义战士。
    刘英俊同志真正做到了“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”。他无限热爱党，无限热爱毛主席，努力活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。他有明确的阶级和阶级斗争观点，立场坚定，爱憎分明，对国内外阶级敌人保持着很高的革命警惕性。他严格要求自己，富于自我批评精神，认真进行思想改造，逐步树立了无产阶级世界观。他在革命实践中刻苦锻炼，自觉地为连队、为人民群众做了大量好事，甘当无名英雄。他坚持突出政治的方向，抵制单纯军事观点的影响，积极地做政治思想工作，努力地为连队革命化建设作出贡献。他利用各种机会，通过各种方式，在连队和人民群众中热情地宣传毛泽东思想，宣扬用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄模范人物。他在开展连队文化活动中，很好地贯彻执行了文艺为无产阶级政治服务，为巩固和提高部队战斗力服务的方针。他积极参加意识形态领域的阶级斗争，坚决批判资产阶级代表人物反党反社会主义的罪恶言行。
    刘英俊同志是在中央军委和林彪同志号召我军突出政治，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，把毛主席的书当作全军各项工作的最高指示这一新形势下，出现的一个先进典型。刘英俊同志用实际行动响应了把毛主席的书当作最高指示的号召。他的主要特点是：努力地学习最高指示，忠实地执行最高指示，热情地宣传最高指示，勇敢地捍卫最高指示。他是最高指示的模范执行者，是我们全军同志学习的榜样。
    当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命正在轰轰烈烈地开展。党中央号召我们：一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。中央军委和林彪同志号召我们大抓突出政治五项原则的落实。在全军开展宣传和学习刘英俊同志的活动，对于更好地贯彻执行党中央、军委和林彪同志的这些指示，推动我军干部战士更加积极地参加文化大革命，促进我军的革命化建设和加强战备，都有很大的意义。
    总政治部要求全军同志学习刘英俊同志的优秀品质。主要的是学习他忠于党，忠于人民，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，把传播毛泽东思想和贯彻毛泽东思想当作毕生的事业。全军同志都应当象刘英俊同志那样，真正把毛主席的书当作一切行动的最高指示。
    总政治部要求各部队组织全体干部战士认真学习和讨论刘英俊同志的模范事迹、日记摘录和报刊上的有关文章。部队报刊要大力宣传。文艺创作和文化活动要大力配合。要把开展宣传和学习刘英俊同志的活动，同当前国内外阶级斗争的形势紧密结合起来，同部队的任务和现实思想紧密结合起来，同宣传和学习本单位的好人好事紧密结合起来。通过宣传和学习刘英俊同志，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动开展得更深入，更扎实，更有成效，培养出更多的象雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊这样的毛主席的好战士。
