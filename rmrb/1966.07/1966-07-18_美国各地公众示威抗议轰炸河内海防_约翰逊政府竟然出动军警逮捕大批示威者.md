New York, July 16 — According to a report in the July 9 issue of the American weekly "National Guardian," after the Johnson administration ordered the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, the American public in many cities held protests to denounce Johnson's aggressive order to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong as a war crime.

In New York, after the announcement of the start of the bombing on June 29, one thousand people protested in front of the U.S. mission to the United Nations on June 30. At the same time, three hundred people set up picket lines at Times Square to protest the bombing.

On July 1, protesters continued to demonstrate in front of the U.S. mission to the United Nations. Forty protesters announced that due to the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, "we can no longer tolerate it, our sense of justice has been insulted." U.S. authorities deployed police to suppress the protests, arresting fourteen protesters and sending them to jail. However, the suppression did not intimidate the American people, and about two hundred people held a protest against the arrests.

In Philadelphia, five hundred people held a full-day protest in front of Independence Hall on July 4. This protest was also suppressed by U.S. authorities, with thirty-seven people arrested and charged with attempting to distribute anti-Vietnam War literature.

In Washington, D.C., the American public held a protest in the Senate corridor on June 30, with twelve people arrested.

In Los Angeles, Boston, and other cities, the American people also held protests.
