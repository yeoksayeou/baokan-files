Liu Yingjun Comrade was an outstanding extracurricular instructor. He regarded the promotion of Mao Zedong Thought as his lifelong mission and considered cultivating red revolutionary successors as his sacred duty.

He started the education of the next generation from class education, inspiring children to love the Party, love Chairman Mao, and love the new society. The first time he met our class, he talked about the hardships of the working people in the old society. He took the children to visit the Martyrs' Memorial Tower, told them revolutionary stories, and told them that today's happy life is hard-won and was paid for with the blood of revolutionary martyrs. We must remember the bitterness of the past, cherish the sweetness of today, listen to Chairman Mao, study hard, and strive to be red revolutionary successors.

Throughout his guidance activities, there was a red thread running through them all: strengthening political and ideological education for children and arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. How to conduct political and ideological education for children? In a letter to me on May 4, 1963, he said: "...It is necessary to clearly understand what they are thinking about. Systematically observe, analyze, and study their ideological trends. Not only should the situation within the school be studied, but also their family conditions, environment, friends, and the content of their games and entertainment..."

On May 19, 1963, he wrote in another letter: "Your work is to cultivate successors for the communist cause. Political and ideological education for students is an important aspect of cultivating students and is the guiding principle of your work. Once the guiding principle is established, everything else will follow. Once the political and ideological aspect is grasped, students will consciously strive towards the cultivation goals; they will actively work, study diligently, and observe discipline. You should often tell them stories about national affairs and heroic models to cultivate in students a strong desire to strive for the motherland, socialism, and communism at any moment. Cultivating children into the new people that the Party and the state hope for is the glorious, noble, and important responsibility of every class teacher and every educator..."

Liu Yingjun Comrade fully practiced what he said in his work as an extracurricular instructor. Whenever he had time, he would come to the school to understand the students' thoughts, talk to the children, conduct home visits, and organize them to study Chairman Mao's works. When he was on duty or hospitalized due to illness and could not come to the school for guidance, he would carry out his work through letters. Before his death, he had written many letters to me and the children. The two letters mentioned earlier were sent within half a month. One was finished at 10:30 PM, and the other at 10:47 PM. From this, one can see how much effort he put into cultivating revolutionary successors with Mao Zedong Thought and how important this work was to him! He often said: "As a son of a poor peasant, I should work more for the Party and contribute more..." He was thus helping and encouraging people to follow the Party's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions with deep class feelings. His actions undoubtedly show that he was a model executor of the highest directives.

Liu Yingjun Comrade dedicated his young life to the people. Though he is gone, he lives on. His heroic image will forever be in our hearts. He is a good example for us to learn from. We will pass on his heroic deeds to the next generation and educate children to learn and apply Chairman Mao's works as he did, to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

### 用毛泽东思想教育孩子——回忆刘英俊同志生前在永安小学的辅导活动

　　用毛泽东思想教育孩子
　　——回忆刘英俊同志生前在永安小学的辅导活动
　　原佳木斯市永安小学教员　孙承菡
    刘英俊同志是一位优秀的校外辅导员。他把宣传毛泽东思想当作自己毕生的战斗任务，把培养红色革命接班人看作是自己的神圣责任。
    他培育下一代能从阶级教育入手，启发孩子们热爱党、热爱毛主席、热爱新社会。他第一次和我们班小朋友见面，就讲了劳动人民在旧社会的苦难生活。他和小朋友一同参谒了烈士纪念塔，给他们讲革命故事，告诉小朋友：今天的幸福生活来之不易，是革命先烈用鲜血换来的，我们要牢记阶级苦，珍惜今日甜，听毛主席的话，好好学习，天天向上，做红色革命接班人。
    他的全部辅导活动，都贯穿着一条红线，就是加强对儿童的政治思想教育，用毛泽东思想武装他们的头脑。怎样向孩子们进行政治思想教育呢？他在一九六三年五月四日给我的信上说：“……必须清楚的了解他们在想些什么？系统的观察、分析、研究他们思想动向。不仅校内的情况要研究，他们的家庭状况、环境与朋友，游戏与娱乐的内容也要研究……。”一九六三年五月十九日，他又在来信中说：“你的工作是在培养共产主义事业的接班人。对学生的政治思想教育是培养学生的一个重要方面，也是你工作中的纲。纲举目张。政治思想一环抓起来了，就会使学生自觉地按培养目标努力；就能使学生积极劳动，刻苦学习，遵守纪律。应当常常讲一些国家大事和英雄模范的故事给他们听，培养学生有一种时刻准备为祖国、为社会主义和共产主义立功的强烈愿望。把孩子培养成为党和国家所希望的共产主义新人，这是每一位班主任，每一个教师的光荣、崇高、重要的责任……。”
    刘英俊同志在担任校外辅导员的工作中，完全实践了他所说的这些话。每当他休息的时候，他都来学校了解学生的思想情况，找小朋友谈心，进行家庭访问，组织他们学习毛主席著作……。当他因公执勤不能来校，因患病住院不能来辅导的时候，他就通过书信来开展工作。他生前曾给我和小朋友们，写过很多信，前面提到的两封，就是在半个月之内寄来的。一封是晚上十点三十分写完的，一封是晚上十点四十七分写完的。从这里可以看出，他为了用毛泽东思想培养革命接班人，花费了多么大的心血；在他的脑海里，这项工作占了多么大的位置！他常说：“作为一个贫农的儿子，我应当多为党工作，多贡献力量……。”他就是这样带着深厚的阶级感情，帮助和鼓舞人们听党的话，按毛主席的指示办事。他的所作所为，不容争辩地说明了他是最高指示的模范执行者。
    刘英俊同志为人民献出了年轻的生命，他虽死犹生。他的英雄形象永远活在我们的心里。他是我们学习的好榜样。我们要把他的英雄事迹传给下一代，教育孩子象他那样活学活用毛主席著作，做毛主席的好战士。
