	Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China

	July 3, 1966

	On June 22nd, Vice Premier Souphanouvong of the Lao National Unity Government, ministers and secretaries of state of the Lao Patriotic Front and the Patriotic Neutralist Forces issued a joint statement on the fourth anniversary of the establishment of the Lao National Unity Government. The statement severely condemns the U.S. imperialists for violating the Geneva Agreement, subverting the Lao National Unity Government, and intensifying aggression against Laos; points out that the Vientiane authorities have become a tool for U.S. imperialism's aggression and interference in Laos; and emphasizes that the United States must stop its aggression and interference in Laos, allowing the Lao people to resolve Laos' internal affairs themselves. The Chinese government and people firmly oppose and strongly condemn the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism against Laos, and firmly support the principled stance articulated by Prince Souphanouvong and the ministers and secretaries of state of the Lao Patriotic Front and the Patriotic Neutralist Forces in the joint statement.

	U.S. imperialism is the culprit behind the violation of the 1962 Geneva Agreement and the aggression and interference in Laos. After the establishment of the Lao National Unity Government in June 1962, U.S. imperialism, in collusion with the Lao right-wing clique, did everything possible to sabotage this government, and on April 19, 1964, through a military coup, overthrew this government. Under the orders of the United States, the right-wing army of Laos has continuously launched military attacks on the liberated areas of the Lao Patriotic Front and the Patriotic Neutralist Forces. Especially in the past two years, U.S. imperialism, in order to support its expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, has intensified its aggression and interference in Laos. U.S. planes have madly bombed and strafed the liberated areas of Laos, directly launching armed aggression against the Lao people.

	At the same time, the right-wing army of Laos has launched large-scale military attacks on the liberated areas of central and southern Laos. Under the orders of the United States, military personnel from Thailand and South Vietnam have gradually infiltrated the central and southern Laos regions, and the U.S. government is actively preparing to send its ground troops into Laos. All of this indicates that U.S. imperialism is plotting to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to Laos and the entire Indochina region.

	Faced with U.S. imperialism's intensified aggression and interference in Laos, the Lao people, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, have waged a courageous and tenacious struggle, achieving one victory after another, and dealing heavy blows to U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The Lao people's struggle for national independence against U.S. aggression, like the Vietnamese people, has set an example for all oppressed nations and peoples in Asia and the world to dare to struggle and dare to win. It shows the world that the truly powerful ones are not the aggressive U.S. imperialists, but the revolutionary people who are united and dare to resist aggression. The Chinese government and people will unswervingly fully support the Lao people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation until they thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors and achieve final victory.

    中华人民共和国外交部声明
    一九六六年七月三日
    六月二十二日，老挝民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党、爱国中立力量的大臣和国务秘书就老挝民族团结政府成立四周年发表联合声明。声明严厉谴责美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协议、颠覆老挝民族团结政府、加紧侵略老挝的罪行；指出万象当局已经成为依附美帝国主义侵略和干涉老挝的工具；强调美国必须停止对老挝的侵略和干涉，让老挝人民自己解决老挝的内部事务。中国政府和中国人民坚决反对和强烈谴责美帝国主义对老挝的侵略罪行，坚决支持苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党、爱国中立力量的大臣和国务秘书在联合声明中所阐明的严正立场。
    美帝国主义是破坏一九六二年日内瓦协议、侵略和干涉老挝的罪魁祸首。一九六二年六月老挝民族团结政府成立后，美帝国主义就勾结老挝右派集团千方百计地破坏这个政府，并且于一九六四年四月十九日通过军事政变推翻了这个政府。在美国的指使下，老挝右派军队不断地对老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量的解放区发动军事进攻。特别是近两年多来，美帝国主义为了配合它扩大侵略越南的战争，更加紧了对老挝的侵略和干涉。美国飞机疯狂地轰炸和扫射老挝解放区，公然对老挝人民发动了直接的武装侵略。
    与此同时，老挝右派军队接连向中、下寮解放区发动大规模的军事进攻。在美国的指使下，泰国和南越的军事人员已经陆续渗入中、下寮地区，美国政府还积极准备派遣它的地面部队进入老挝。所有这一切都说明，美帝国主义正在阴谋把侵略越南的战争扩大到老挝和整个印度支那地区。
    面对美帝国主义加紧扩大对老挝的侵略和干涉，老挝人民在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，进行了英勇顽强的斗争，取得了一个又一个的重大胜利，给予美帝国主义及其走狗以沉重的打击。老挝人民为争取民族独立所进行的抗美救国斗争，同越南人民一样，为亚洲和全世界一切被压迫民族和人民做出了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的榜样。它向全世界表明，真正强大的不是张牙舞爪的美帝国主义，而是团结一致、敢于反抗侵略的革命人民。中国政府和中国人民坚定不移地全力支援老挝人民的抗美救国斗争，直到他们彻底打败美国侵略者，取得最后的胜利。
