Gansu's first cotton textile mill, the Lanzhou Cotton Textile Mill, began production on July 2.

This mill is equipped with 50,000 spinning spindles and more than 2,000 looms, capable of producing 46,500 bales of cotton yarn and over 56 million meters of various cotton fabrics annually. To meet the preferences and needs of local farmers and herdsmen, the mill will focus on producing affordable, durable cotton fabrics to supply the market.

Gansu is one of China's emerging cotton-producing regions. Counties such as Dunhuang, Anxi, Jinta in the Hexi Corridor, and Jingyuan in the central part of the province are major cotton-producing areas. These regions, with their high temperatures and long hours of sunlight, produce cotton that is white in color and has long fibers, making it an excellent raw material for the cotton textile industry. Previously, Gansu's cotton was mainly transported to Shanghai, Xi'an, and other places for textile mills to use. Now, with the establishment of a cotton textile mill in the province, this cotton can be processed locally.

    甘肃第一座棉纺织厂投入生产
    甘肃新建第一座棉纺织厂——兰州棉纺织厂，七月二日投入生产。
    这座棉纺织厂拥有五万个纱锭和二千多台布机，每年可以生产棉纱四万六千五百件，各种棉布五千六百多万米。为了适应当地农牧民的喜爱和需要，这个工厂将以较大力量生产价廉、厚实的棉布，供应市场。
    甘肃是我国新兴的产棉区之一。这个省河西走廊地区的敦煌、安西、金塔和中部的靖远等县，都是集中产棉区。这些地区，由于气温高、日照时间长，所产棉花色泽洁白，纤维长，是棉纺织工业的好原料。过去，甘肃棉花一向外运，供应上海、西安等地的纺织工厂使用。现在，由于本省新建了棉纺织厂，这些棉花就可以就地加工了。
