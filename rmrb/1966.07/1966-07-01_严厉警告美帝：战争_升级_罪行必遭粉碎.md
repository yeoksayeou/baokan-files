Severe Warning to the U.S. Imperialists: The Crimes of War "Escalation" Will Be Shattered

Citizens and Soldiers of Hanoi Hold Meetings to Strongly Denounce the U.S. Bandit Aircraft's Bombing of Hanoi

	New China News Agency Hanoi, June 30th

	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 30th, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' war "escalation" actions of bombing the capital Hanoi and the outskirts of Haiphong. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	On June 29th and 30th, 1966, U.S. aircraft repeatedly attacked the outskirts of the capital Hanoi and Haiphong, bombing residential areas and economic facilities.

	This is a new "escalation" in the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The U.S. imperialists have once again blatantly violated the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Vietnamese question and all international law. The U.S. imperialists' blatant actions of invading the capital Hanoi and Haiphong are a gross trample on the sovereignty and national independence of the Vietnamese people, and a brazen provocation to the socialist camp and all peace-loving countries.

	After suffering heavy defeats in South Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors attempt, with this extremely heinous act, to threaten the spirit of the Vietnamese people and extricate themselves from the military and political quagmire they are in.

	The U.S. bombing of the outskirts of the capital Hanoi and Haiphong once again exposes their aggressive and warlike nature, and exposes the sham of the U.S. government's talk of "peace" and "unconditional discussions."

	The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly protests and denounces to international public opinion the aforementioned extremely heinous acts of aggression by the U.S. government against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sternly warns the U.S. aggressors: Every time you escalate the war in Vietnam, you will be shattered, and every one of your evil acts will be punished accordingly. The war of aggression by U.S. imperialism will surely be thoroughly defeated. The Vietnamese people will definitely win.

	The government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam earnestly appeal to the socialist countries, the governments and peoples of the world who love peace and uphold justice, to continue to strongly support and aid the patriotic struggle of the Vietnamese people, to severely condemn U.S. imperialism, and to take decisive actions to stop the war of aggression by U.S. imperialism.

	The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam earnestly appeals to the people of the world and the American people, for the sake of peace and justice, for the sake of the interests of your own nation, to strengthen your fighting unity with the Vietnamese people, to firmly demand that U.S. imperialism stop its extremely heinous acts of aggression in Vietnam, to demand that U.S. troops withdraw completely, and to demand that the U.S. government respect the national rights of the Vietnamese people.

	New China News Agency Hanoi, June 30th

	Major Ho Van Lau, representative of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army, held a press conference in Hanoi on the evening of the 29th, strongly protesting and severely condemning the U.S. imperialists' extremely serious new war "escalation" crimes of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong.

	After introducing to the reporters the process of the U.S. bandit aircraft attacking Hanoi and Haiphong and indiscriminately bombing residential areas and economic units, Ho Van Lau emphasized that this is an extremely serious new war "escalation" action by the U.S. bandits, and is an increasingly serious crime committed by the U.S. bandits against the people of North Vietnam.

	Ho Van Lau pointed out that the new crimes committed by U.S. imperialism completely expose their so-called sham of not bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. In fact, it is the Johnson administration that decided to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong. The facts further expose their savage aggressive and warlike nature.

	Ho Van Lau said, every time the U.S. imperialist aggressors shout "peace talks," they further intensify the war of aggression. Recently, they have been shouting "peace" again, but the Vietnamese people have long been on guard and have shattered their "escalation" plots.

	Ho Van Lau pointed out that U.S. imperialism has suffered defeats in both North and South Vietnam, and the more they "escalate," the more they will suffer even heavier defeats.

	After Ho Van Lau's speech, an American pilot who was captured by the citizens and soldiers of Hanoi that day was brought to the press conference. This captured American pilot admitted that he was a captain in the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 333rd Tactical Fighter Group of the U.S. Air Force, with the military number FR-69506. On the 29th, he was ordered to take off from the U.S. base in Thailand, Don Muang, to bomb Hanoi. Under the powerful fire of the Vietnamese people and soldiers, his plane was shot down, and he was captured after parachuting.

	New China News Agency Hanoi, June 30th

	The outrageous crime of the U.S. bandits sending aircraft to attack the capital Hanoi has aroused the extreme indignation of the citizens and soldiers of Hanoi.

	From the night of the 29th to the 30th, many factories, offices, and neighborhoods in Hanoi held meetings, strongly denouncing the U.S. aggressor bandits, and celebrating the victory of shooting down six U.S. bandit aircraft in the past two days. The people participating in the meetings repeatedly shouted, "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "U.S. aggressors, get out of Vietnam!" "Firmly eliminate the U.S. bandits and defend the capital Hanoi!"

	Nearly 500 young laborers, youths, and members of the Anti-American Rescue Youth Shock Teams in the Second District of Hanoi held a meeting immediately after the battle ended on the 29th. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution, expressing their determination to further heighten vigilance, strengthen combat training, and be ready to bravely participate in the battle at any time, firmly eliminating the invading U.S. aggressor bandits.

	The residents and workers on various construction sites in the Dong Da District of Hanoi also held meetings, denouncing the U.S. bandit aircraft's outrageous crimes of bombing the urban areas of Hanoi and Haiphong.

	The cadres and workers of the An Phu Power Plant at the meeting unanimously expressed their determination to produce well and fight well, to ensure safe power supply in any situation, and to support the victory of the battle. More than 300 cadres and workers of the Hanoi General Department Store also expressed their determination to do a good job in air defense and to better serve the battle and production of the capital's military and civilians.

	On various battlefronts, the heroic people's army air defense forces and the broad masses of militia self-defense forces also held meetings. They unanimously expressed: "We will fight more fiercely, more ruthlessly, and more accurately, and shoot down more invading enemy planes."

	On the night of the 29th, tens of thousands of citizens of Hanoi, filled with boundless hatred for the U.S. bandits, poured onto the streets to watch the pathetic state of an American pilot who was captured that day. When the truck transporting the American bandit passed by, the people gathered on the streets angrily waved their fists and roared, shaking the city with their cries: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Shatter all the plots of the U.S. bandits!" "Defend the capital!" "Defend the North, liberate the South, and unify the country!"

    严厉警告美帝：战争“升级”罪行必遭粉碎
    何文楼大校在记者招待会上揭露美帝叫嚷和谈的无耻骗局
    河内市军民纷纷集会愤怒声讨美国强盗飞机轰炸河内
    新华社河内三十日电  越南民主共和国外交部三十日就美国飞机轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市和海防市外围地区发表一项声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义的战争“升级”行动。声明全文如下：
    一九六六年六月二十九日和三十日，美国飞机多次袭击首都河内和海防市外围地区，轰炸居民区和经济设施。
    这是美帝国主义在对越南民主共和国进行的侵略战争中的新的“升级”。美帝国主义又一次极其明目张胆地违反一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议和一切国际法。美帝国主义侵犯首都河内和海防市的明目张胆的行动，是对越南人民的主权和民族独立的极其粗暴的践踏，是对社会主义阵营和所有爱好和平国家的蛮横挑衅。
    美国远征军在越南南方遭到惨重失败后，美国侵略者妄图以这种罪大恶极的行动，来威胁越南人民的精神和摆脱它在军事上和政治上所深陷泥潭的处境。
    美国轰炸首都河内和海防市外围地区的行动，再一次暴露了它的侵略和好战面目，揭穿了美国当局的“和平”、“无条件讨论”的论调。
    越南民主共和国政府向国际舆论强烈抗议和控诉美国政府对越南民主共和国的上述罪大恶极的侵略行动。越南民主共和国政府严厉警告美国侵略者：你们在越南的每次战争“升级”必将遭到粉碎，你们的每个罪恶行动必将遭到应有的惩罚。美帝国主义进行的侵略战争必将彻底失败。越南人民一定胜利。
    越南民主共和国政府和越南人民恳切呼吁社会主义各国、世界爱好和平和主持公理的各国政府和人民，继续强有力地支持和援助越南人民的爱国斗争，严厉谴责美帝国主义，并采取坚决行动制止美帝国主义进行的侵略战争。
    越南民主共和国政府殷切呼吁世界人民和美国人民，为了和平和公理，为了本民族的利益，加强同越南人民的战斗团结，坚决要求美帝国主义停止在越南进行的罪大恶极的侵略战争，要求美军全部撤回国去，要求美国政府必须尊重越南人民的民族权利。
    一九六六年六月三十日于河内
    新华社河内三十日电越南人民军总司令部代表何文楼大校二十九日晚在河内举行记者招待会，强烈抗议和严厉谴责美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防的极其严重的新的战争“升级”罪行。
    何文楼向记者们介绍了美国强盗飞机袭击河内和海防滥肆轰炸居民区和经济单位的经过之后强调指出，这是美国强盗的极其严重的新的战争“升级”行动，这是美国强盗对越南北方人民犯下的越来越严重的罪行。
    何文楼指出，美帝国主义犯下的新罪行，完全揭穿了它们宣扬的所谓不轰炸河内和海防的无耻骗人论调。事实上，正是约翰逊当局决定轰炸河内和海防的。事实进一步暴露了它们的野蛮侵略和好战面目。
    何文楼说，美帝国主义侵略者每次叫嚷“和平谈判”，就进一步加强侵略战争。最近它们又叫嚷“和平”，但是越南人民早就有所警惕，并且粉碎了它们的“升级”阴谋。
    何文楼指出，美帝国主义已经在越南南北两方遭到惨败，它们越是“升级”，就越要遭到更加惨重的失败。
    在何文楼讲话以后，当天被河内军民活捉的一名美国飞行员被押到记者招待会上。这个被俘的美国飞行员供认，他是美国空军第三百五十五战术战斗机联队第三百三十三战术战斗机大队的上尉飞行员，军号是FR—69506。二十九日，他奉命从美国在泰国的打卡里基地起飞，前来轰炸河内。在越南军民的强大炮火下，他的飞机被击落，他跳伞后被俘。
    据新华社河内三十日电　美国强盗悍然派遣飞机袭击越南首都河内市区的滔天罪行，激起了河内市军民的极大愤怒。
    从二十九日夜晚到三十日，河内市许多工厂、机关和街区人民纷纷举行集会，愤怒声讨美国侵略强盗，并且庆祝这两天中击落美国强盗飞机六架的胜利。参加集会的人民不断振臂高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“美国侵略者滚出越南去！”“坚决消灭美国强盗，保卫首都河内！”
    河内市二征夫人区的劳动青年团员、青年和抗美救国青年突击队员近五百人，二十九日在战斗刚结束后就举行了集会。集会一致通过了决心书，表示要进一步提高警惕，加强备战训练，随时准备英勇地参加战斗，坚决消灭来犯的美国侵略强盗。
    河内市栋多区的居民们和各工地上的工人们，也纷纷举行集会，声讨美国强盗飞机轰炸河内市和海防市市区的滔天罪行。
    安付发电厂的干部和职工在集会上一致表示，保证要生产好，战斗好，在任何情况下都安全供电，支援战斗的胜利。河内综合百货公司的干部和职工三百多人，也表示要做好防空工作，更好地为首都军民的战斗和生产服务。
    在各个战斗阵地上，英雄的人民军防空部队和广大民兵自卫队，也纷纷举行集会。他们一致表示：要打得更猛、更狠、更准，打落更多来犯的敌机。
    二十九日夜晚，河内市成千上万的市民怀着对美国强盗的无比仇恨涌上街头，观看在当天被活捉的一个美国飞行员的狼狈相。当押运美国飞贼的卡车开过时，聚集在街道上的人民，愤怒地挥舞着拳头，发出震撼城市的怒吼声：“打倒美帝国主义！”“粉碎美国强盗的一切阴谋！”“保卫首都！”“保卫北方，解放南方，统一祖国！”
