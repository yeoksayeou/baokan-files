The "Tashan Hero Regiment" held a military-civilian meeting to share experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works

Chairman Mao's thought on people's war is the key to victory.

The people and the army armed with Chairman Mao's thought on people's war have the highest level of consciousness, the most ardent fighting spirit, and the smartest minds, forming the most solid iron wall. Chairman Mao's thought on people's war not only guided the great victory of the Chinese revolution but is also playing a tremendous role in the world revolutionary movement.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Guangzhou on the 30th, on the eve of the "August 1st" Military Day, the "Tashan Hero Regiment" of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a meeting to share experiences in studying Chairman Mao's thought on people's war. They used a large number of vivid facts to demonstrate the great strategic significance of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war and to praise the brilliant victories of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war. The following is a summary of some of the speeches.

People's war is the magic weapon for our army to defeat the enemy

Regiment Commander Zhang Manyun: At present, American imperialism is conducting aggression everywhere and is crazily expanding its aggression in our neighboring country, Vietnam. Under such circumstances, holding this military-civilian meeting to share experiences in studying Chairman Mao's thought on people's war is of great significance. Chairman Mao's thought on people's war not only guided the great victory of the Chinese revolution but is also playing a tremendous role in the world revolutionary movement.

Our army is a unit with a glorious revolutionary tradition. For decades, from small to large, we have relied on people's war to achieve victory. Especially in the Battle of Tashan, it fully demonstrated the tremendous power of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war. With the support and cooperation of the people of Tashan, we repelled the enemy's frantic attacks by eleven divisions, completely annihilated Chiang Kai-shek's elite "Zhao Zilong Division," and were awarded the title of "Tashan Hero Regiment." Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu also received us. Countless facts have proven that people's war is the most effective magic weapon to defeat American imperialism and its running dogs.

Soldier Lin Zunian: The people and the army armed with Chairman Mao's thought on people's war have the highest level of consciousness, the most ardent fighting spirit, and the smartest minds, forming the most solid iron wall. The fact of annihilating a group of American-Chiang bandit spies near my hometown is the best example.

I live by the sea. One night in 1963, the Taiwan American-Chiang bandits sent a group of armed spies to secretly land at a port in Guangdong and attempted to infiltrate the interior to carry out sabotage activities. As soon as this group of bandit spies crawled onto the beach, they fell into the net of our military and civilians. Several hundred civilians armed with long guns and short knives divided into three groups to cooperate with the troops in the encirclement and annihilation, and all the passages were blocked. Seeing the situation was not good, the Chiang bandit spies immediately turned around and ran towards the beach, attempting to escape. At this moment, they happened to encounter the fisherman Cai Quan and his brother. The cunning spies used both threats and bribes, sometimes threatening Cai Quan and his brother with a pistol to open the boat, and sometimes trying to bribe them with watches and money. But Cai Quan and his brother did not pay any attention to this and used methods such as breaking the oar and running aground to delay time in every possible way, cooperating with the military and civilians to annihilate this group of armed spies.

The decisive factor in war is people, not weapons

Shantou District activist in studying Chairman Mao's works, militia deputy platoon leader Zhang Yancui: Chairman Mao said, "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." This is an absolute truth. The experience of our hometown people using homemade guns and cannons to cooperate with the PLA to annihilate the Chiang bandits in 1949 fully demonstrated the correctness of Chairman Mao's wise judgment. At that time, the Chiang bandits had a company of troops, with more than ten light machine guns, launching a rampant attack on us. The PLA had only two platoons, and their weapons were much inferior to the enemy's. However, the PLA comrades had a high level of class consciousness and deep hatred for the enemy, and they were extremely brave in battle. Our entire village, men, women, old, and young, were all organized to help repair fortifications, transport ammunition, and rescue the wounded, cooperating with the PLA to kill a large number of enemies. In the end, all the bandits were annihilated.

Combat hero Mai Xiande, who had been in the army for only over a year, sustained a serious head injury in a fierce naval battle but continued to fight for three hours, also fully demonstrated the correctness of Chairman Mao's wise judgment that the decisive factor in war is people, not things. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. We must strive to study Chairman Mao's works, carry forward the spirit of bravery and fearlessness, and no matter what kind of "superior" equipment the enemy has, we can defeat and annihilate it!

Passing down the thought of people's war from generation to generation

Platoon Leader Long Chuanbao: Chairman Mao's great thought of believing in the masses and relying on the masses is the source of the victory of people's war. Our platoon has been following Chairman Mao's teaching since its establishment in 1937, nearly thirty years ago. From the War of Resistance Against Japan to the War of Liberation, from Tashan to the South China Sea, we have established a blood-bonded relationship with the masses. Every victory in battle is the result of the full support of the people. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our platoon was then stationed in Jiaodong, Shandong. Poor peasant Yu Laoda gave two sons to the revolution. After his eldest son, Yu Xianxing, annihilated several Japanese devils and died a heroic death in the Huilongshan battle, he resolutely sent his second son to our platoon and encouraged him to fight bravely for the people. When the platoon leader and comrades comforted Old Yu, he encouraged the comrades instead, saying, "It's okay. Revolution means there will inevitably be bloodshed and sacrifice. Sacrifice for the poor to rise up is the most worthwhile."

Although this incident happened more than twenty years ago, every time I think of it and see the countless people sending their excellent sons to the revolutionary army, my heart is always deeply moved. We must rely on the people and pass down Chairman Mao's thought of people's war from generation to generation.

    “塔山英雄团”召开军民讲用会交流学习毛主席著作心得
    毛主席人民战争思想是胜利之本
    用毛主席人民战争思想武装起来的人民群众和部队，觉悟最高，斗志最昂扬，脑子最聪明，是一堵最坚固的铜墙铁壁。毛主席的人民战争思想，不仅指导中国革命取得了伟大胜利，而且在世界革命运动中正在发挥着巨大的威力。
    据新华社广州三十日电　“八一”建军节前夕，中国人民解放军广州部队某部“塔山英雄团”召开了军民学习毛主席人民战争思想的讲用会。他们用大量活生生的事实，论证了毛主席人民战争思想的伟大战略意义，歌颂了毛主席人民战争思想的光辉胜利。这里，摘要介绍部分人的发言。
    人民战争是我军克敌制胜的法宝
    团长张万年：当前美帝国主义到处进行侵略，并在我们的邻邦越南疯狂地扩大侵略战争。在这种形势下，举行这个军民学习毛主席人民战争思想的讲用会，我觉得有重大的意义。毛主席的人民战争思想，不仅指导中国革命取得了伟大的胜利，而且在世界革命运动中正在发挥着巨大的威力。
    我们这支部队是有着光荣革命传统的部队。我们几十年来从小到大，就是依靠人民战争取得胜利的。特别是塔山战斗，更充分显示了毛主席人民战争思想的巨大威力。我们在塔山人民的配合支持下，打退了敌人十一个师的疯狂进攻，全部歼灭了蒋介石精锐部队“赵子龙师”，荣获“塔山英雄团”的称号。毛主席和朱总司令还接见了我们。无数事实证明，人民战争是战胜美帝国主义及其走狗最有效的法宝。
    战士林祖念：用毛主席人民战争思想武装起来的人民群众和部队，觉悟最高，斗志最昂扬，脑子最聪明，是一堵最坚固的铜墙铁壁。我们家乡附近一次歼灭美蒋武装特务的事实，就是最好的例证。
    我家住在海边。一九六三年的一天夜里，台湾美蒋匪帮派遣了一股武装特务，在广东的一个港口偷偷登陆，妄图窜入内地，进行破坏活动。这股匪特一爬上海滩，就陷入我军民组成的天罗地网之中。几百名群众手持长枪、短刀，分成三路配合部队进行围剿，所有的路口都被封住了。蒋匪特务见形势不妙，立即调头往海滩跑，企图逃窜。这时，正好遇上渔民蔡全两兄弟。狡猾的特务软硬兼施，一会儿用手枪威逼蔡全兄弟开船，一会儿又用手表、金钱收买。但蔡全兄弟根本不理他这一套，用断桨、搁浅等办法千方百计拖延时间，配合军民歼灭了这股武装特务。
    决定战争胜败的是人不是武器
    汕头专区学习毛主席著作积极分子、民兵副排长张燕卿：毛主席说：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”这是千真万确的真理。一九四九年，我们家乡群众用土枪土炮配合解放军歼灭蒋匪的战斗经过，就充分显示了毛主席这一英明论断的正确。当时，蒋匪军有一个连的兵力，光轻机枪就有十几挺，向我们发起了猖狂进攻。解放军只有两个排，武器也比敌人差得多，但是，解放军同志都有高度的阶级觉悟，对敌人有刻骨的仇恨，在战斗中无比的英勇。我们全村男女老少也都组织起来帮助修工事，运弹药，救伤员，配合解放军大量杀伤敌人。最后全部歼灭了匪兵。
    战斗英雄麦贤得，到部队才一年多，在激烈的海战中，头负重伤，仍然坚持战斗三个小时，也充分说明了毛主席关于决定战争胜败的是人不是物这一英明论断的正确。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。我们一定要努力学习毛主席著作，发扬勇敢、不怕死的战斗精神，不管敌人有什么样的“优势”装备，我们都能够打败它，消灭它！
    把人民战争思想一代一代地传下去
    连长龙川保：毛主席关于相信群众、依靠群众的伟大思想，是人民战争胜利的源泉。我们连从一九三七年创立起到现在的将近三十年中，一直遵循着毛主席这一教导。从抗日战争到解放战争，从塔山到南海边，同群众建立了血肉相连的关系，每一次战斗的胜利，都是人民群众全力支持的结果。抗日战争期间，我们这个连当时驻在山东胶东，贫农岳老大爷就为革命献出了两个儿子。当他的大儿子岳显兴在回龙山战斗中消灭了几个鬼子壮烈牺牲以后，他又毅然地把第二个儿子送到我们连，勉励他好好为人民杀敌立功。当连长和同志们安慰老大爷的时候，他反而鼓励同志们说：“不要紧，革命嘛，总免不了流血牺牲。为了穷人翻身而牺牲是最值得的。”
    这件事情虽然过去二十多年了，但是每想起这件事和看到千千万万人民群众把自己优秀的儿子送到革命部队，我心里总是万分激动。我们一定要依靠人民群众，把毛主席的人民战争思想一代一代地传下去。
