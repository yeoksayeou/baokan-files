	Vietnamese people warmly welcome the reprint of "On Practice" and "On Contradiction"
	Praise Mao Zedong Thought as the highest and most alive Marxism-Leninism

	HANOI, July 1 (Xinhua) — Chairman Mao's philosophical works "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," reprinted in Vietnamese by the "Truth Publishing House," were released in Hanoi on July 1, the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, and have been warmly welcomed by a wide range of readers.

	According to a responsible person from the "Truth Publishing House," Chairman Mao's two philosophical works, "On Practice" has been printed in Vietnam six times, and "On Contradiction" seven times, totaling more than 60,000 copies. However, this still cannot meet the needs of the broad readership, so the "Truth Publishing House" has reprinted more than 10,000 combined copies this time.

	This person also said that the broad cadres and people of Vietnam deeply respect Chairman Mao and enthusiastically read Chairman Mao's books, striving to learn Mao Zedong Thought.

	Many readers also told our reporter: Chairman Mao's books are rich in content, easy to understand, and are classic works of Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest and most alive Marxism-Leninism of our time.

    越南人民热烈欢迎《实践论》《矛盾论》再版
    赞颂毛泽东思想是最高最活的马列主义
    新华社河内一日电　毛主席的哲学名著《实践论》和《矛盾论》的越文本，最近由越南“真理出版社”再版，于七月一日——中国共产党成立四十五周年纪念日——在河内发行，受到广大读者的热烈欢迎。
    据“真理出版社”的负责人说，毛主席的这两部哲学著作，《实践论》过去在越南已经印行了六版，《矛盾论》印行了七版，共六万多册，但是仍不能满足广大读者的需要，所以，“真理出版社”这次便再印行了一万多册合订本。
    这位负责人还说，越南广大干部和人民非常敬爱毛主席，热情地读毛主席的书，努力学习毛泽东思想。
    许多读者也向本社记者说：毛主席的书内容丰富，读起来好懂，是马克思列宁主义的经典著作。毛泽东思想是当代最高最活的马列主义。
