Chilean workers and revolutionaries are eagerly studying the works of Chairman Mao Zedong, regarding them as their guide to struggle.

Many trade union organizations are eager to purchase Chairman Mao's works; union cadres and members are enthusiastically studying them and using them to guide their struggles. Copper miners, who have been engaged in a tough struggle against U.S. monopoly capital, are diligently studying Chairman Mao's works.

Chairman Mao's works have played a tremendous guiding role for Chilean Marxist-Leninists who oppose revisionism in establishing their own revolutionary organizations. Indian leader Vicente Maricque said that Chairman Mao's works contain the fundamental line for achieving revolutionary victory, liberating the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and eliminating imperialist rule.

Senator Jaime Barros, who has broken away from the revisionist leadership clique controlling the Chilean Communist Party, said that he has gained great benefits from studying Chairman Mao's works, which have helped him in his work.

Luis Bernal, a leader of the powerful dockworkers' union in Valparaiso, expressed admiration for Chairman Mao's works. He said that these works are the continuation and development of Marx and Lenin's thought in our era.

At a recent enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Chilean Revolutionary Communist Party, the full text of Chairman Mao's work "Oppose Liberalism" was read. The nearly forty participants in the enlarged meeting pointed out that Chairman Mao's work exposes the essence of liberalism; to make rapid progress and seize the leadership of the revolution, and to lead the broad masses of the people in waging a revolutionary struggle against imperialism, it is necessary to oppose these shortcomings.
