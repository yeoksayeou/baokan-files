The emergency meeting of Asian and African writers held in Beijing from June 27 to July 9, 1966, heard a report from the delegation of the Rwanda National Union regarding the political situation in Central Africa, particularly in Rwanda.

	The meeting noted that the puppet regime in Rwanda, led by Kayibanda, a puppet of the new colonialism of Belgium and the United States and supported by the reactionary regime of Israel and the bandit gang of Chiang Kai-shek, has since 1961 subjected the people of Rwanda, especially members of the opposition party, the Rwanda National Union, to a reign of terror and bloody dictatorship.

	The delegates present clearly remember the shameful massacre carried out by the Kigali puppet government with the support of Belgian soldiers in 1964, in which over fifty thousand Rwandan patriots were killed, including women, children, and all members of the leadership committee of the opposition party, the Rwanda National Union.

	The meeting strongly condemns the fascist methods used by the current Rwandan regime in its attempt to maintain its unpopular rule.

	The meeting condemns the savage and bloody rule of Kayibanda and unreservedly supports the revolutionary struggle of the true patriots of Rwanda, who for six years have been fighting to liberate their country from reactionary rule and to establish a people's government in Rwanda that meets the reasonable aspirations of the masses.

    关于卢旺达问题的决议
    一九六六年六月二十七日到七月九日在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议听取了卢旺达民族联盟代表团有关中非、特别是有关卢旺达的政治形势的报告。
    ——会议注意到，受到以色列反动政权和帝国主义走狗蒋介石匪帮支持的比利时、美国新殖民主义傀儡卡伊班达所领导的卢旺达傀儡政权从一九六一年以来对卢旺达人民、特别是对反对党卢旺达民族联盟的成员进行了恐怖统治和血腥的独裁。
    ——与会代表清楚地记得一九六四年基卡里傀儡政府在比利时士兵的支持下所进行的无耻的屠杀，在这次屠杀中五万多个卢旺达的爱国者牺牲了，其中有妇女，有儿童，还有反对党卢旺达民族联盟领导委员会的所有成员。
    ——会议强烈谴责卢旺达现政权妄想维持其不得人心的统治所使用的法西斯手段。
    ——会议谴责卡伊班达的野蛮和血腥统治，无保留地支持卢旺达真正的爱国者六年来为了使他们的国家从反动的统治下解放出来，为了在卢旺达建立一个符合群众合理愿望的人民政权所进行的革命斗争。
