Title: A Beautiful Air Battle Over Hanoi

Near the wings of victory, I once again met and talked with the pilots of N's squadron. It was they who had just shot down two American planes.

The squadron leader, N, held a few small, swift airplane models in his hand as he described to me their victorious battle with the American aggressors at the gates of the capital.

Early in the morning, the command center suddenly issued the order to take off. As the soldiers' planes had just left the airfield, they saw a column of black smoke rising from the distant ground. Another village in our motherland was being ravaged by the American aggressors! The squadron leader, N, suddenly remembered that the fires burning from the enemy's bombs were in a place he had once visited! Hatred for the enemy boiled in his chest. Before them, two black dots appeared clearly, followed by many more. The enemy planes were so numerous! They swarmed like flies at different altitudes and in different directions. N's squadron, however, was like an arrow, charging towards them with extraordinary bravery. This battle was intense and tense from the start. N notified his comrades to cover him so that he could attack the enemy planes. The squadron's comrades immediately engaged the enemy planes, creating opportunities for their squadron leader to fight without worry. But cruelty and cowardice are the nature of the American aggressors. At this moment, people saw the enemy planes frantically dropping bombs haphazardly. N did not hesitate and pursued the enemy planes tightly. As soon as the enemy plane was locked in the sight, N clenched his teeth, filling his cannon with all his hatred, and fired fiercely at the enemy's head. His incredibly fierce cannon fire immediately brought down the enemy.

At this time, our comrade H also faced a very complicated situation. When H attacked an enemy plane, two enemy planes were right behind him, trying to catch up. But H remained very calm, trusting in the cover of his comrades. His burst of cannon fire cut off the enemy's path. Immediately, the enemy changed from a fierce, rampaging posture to displaying their specialty—running away as soon as they encountered our planes. But H did not let go. He pursued tightly, not blinking an eye as he fired a long burst of cannon fire. A sense of extreme excitement spread throughout his body. The enemy plane tried desperately to escape, but at this moment it was already uncontrollably wobbling. This American air pirate had lost his balance and could not save himself from his doomed fate. At this time, relying on their numbers, the enemy tried to desperately counterattack us. One of their A4D planes had just crashed into the ground, and another enemy plane appeared next to H. It attempted to strike H unexpectedly. But H saw it clearly. The radio transmitted the voice of squadron leader N: "Attack calmly. I have you covered!" H became even more confident. Look at this "ghost" (note) how cunning it is! In front of H, it was performing its signature trick. H thought to himself, "I have a way to take you down." The enemy plane flew up, and H pursued tightly. The enemy plane dove down, and H did not let go. Suddenly, H saw two bright lights flashing by on either side. Great! This American "ghost" was firing rockets! H had experience with this and skillfully dodged to the side, avoiding the danger. The thrilling moment passed. At this time, he heard the squadron leader's warm voice again: "Don't worry! Aim and fire fiercely! I have you covered." H was so excited and happy! Because in this intense air battle, he heard the commanding voice of the commander full of power time and time again. Therefore, H's silver swallow soared freely with his comrades, defeating the enemy who outnumbered them...

The battle ended quickly. The demons could no longer pollute the sky at the gates of our beloved capital. One after another, the victorious silver swallows flew over the sky, paying tribute to the dear capital, and then gently landed on the runway amidst the cheers of the entire airport, including the mechanics who had contributed to this glorious victory and were eagerly waiting for their return.

    河内地区一场漂亮的空战
    〔越南〕新海
    在胜利的银翼近旁，我又一次与N同志编队的飞行员们会面交谈。是他们，刚刚打下了两架美国飞机。
    编队长N同志手里拿着几只银燕一般小巧的飞机模型，对我描述他们胜利地在首都大门与美国强盗进行一场较量的经过。
    清晨，指挥所突然发出出击的信号。战士们的飞机刚刚离开机场，就看见在远远的地面上冲起了一股黑烟。祖国的又一个乡村正在遭到美国强盗的蹂躏！编队长N同志突然想起，敌人炸弹轰起的这些烈火，是在他曾经到过的地方燃烧着呵！对敌的仇恨，在胸中沸腾。在他们面前，清楚地出现了两个黑点，接着又出现了许多黑点。敌机来得真多呀！简直象苍蝇一样，在不同的高度，不同的方向乱冲乱撞。N同志的编队仍然象一支利箭，以异常勇猛的气势直向它们冲去。这一仗，一开始就十分激烈和紧张。N通知战友掩护自己，以便他对敌机发动攻击。编队的战友们立即缠住敌机，创造机会，让自己的编队长安心地战斗。但是，凶恶和怕死是美国强盗的本性。这时候，人们看到敌人的飞机慌慌张张地把一颗颗炸弹胡乱扔下来。N同志毫不迟疑地紧紧向敌机追去。当敌机一被套进了瞄准光环，N同志立即咬紧牙关，把满腔仇恨注满炮膛，向敌人的头上猛打过去。他那无比猛烈的炮火，立即把这个敌人打下来。
    这时候，在我们的H同志面前也出现了十分复杂的情况。当H同志向一架敌机发动攻击时，两架敌机正在他的后边想要紧紧咬着他。但是H同志却十分镇静，他对战友们的掩护是放心的。他的一串炮弹切断了敌人的航向。立即，敌人就从气势汹汹地狂撕乱咬的架势，一变而耍出它们的特长——一遇我机就“拚命逃跑”。但是H同志却不放过它。他追得紧紧的，眼睛一眨也不眨就发出一长串炮弹。一种极度的兴奋传遍了他的全身。敌机拚命想脱身逃跑，但是这时它已不由自主地歪歪斜斜起来了。这个美国飞贼已经失去了平衡，挽救不了他那灭亡的命运。这时敌人倚仗着它们势众，妄图死命向我们进行反扑。它们的一架A4D飞机刚刚一头往地面栽，另一架敌机又在H同志旁边出现了。它企图给H同志出其不意的一击。但是H同志却看得分明。无线电中传来编队长N同志的声音：“镇静地攻击。有我掩护哩！”H同志更加信心百倍了。你看这只“鬼怪”（注）是多么狡猾呀！在H同志面前，它正搬弄出它拿手的好戏。H同志暗想：“老子可有办法干掉你”。敌机往上窜，H同志紧紧追。敌机往下钻，H同志毫不放松它。突然间，H看到两旁闪过来两道亮光。好哇！这只美国“鬼怪”在放火箭啦！对于这一手，H同志早就有经验，他十分灵巧地闪过一旁，避开了。惊险的一刹那过去了。这时候，他又听到了编队长的亲切的声音：“放心吧！对准它狠狠地打！有我掩护你。”H同志是多么激动、愉快呵！因为在这次激烈的空战中，他一次又一次地听到指挥员充满力量的声音。正因此，H同志的银燕矫健地纵横展翅，与战友们一起，战胜了一倍于他们的敌人……。
    战斗，很快地结束了。魔鬼们已经不能继续污染我们亲爱的首都大门的天空了。一只只胜利的银燕掠空而过，向亲爱的首都致敬礼，然后就在那些曾为这次辉煌胜利作出贡献的机械员和正在热切地等待他们返航的整个机场同志的欢呼声中轻轻地滑下跑道。
