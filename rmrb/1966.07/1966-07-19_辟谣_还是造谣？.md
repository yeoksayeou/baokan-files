Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi on July 10 in Beijing exposed the conspiracy between the United States and the Soviet Union to use "bombing to force peace" against the Vietnamese people, which made the Soviet revisionist leadership furious. On July 14, the Soviet TASS news agency issued an authorized statement supposedly "debunking rumors," denying that the United States had informed the Soviet Union in advance of its decision to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong, and launched a personal attack on Vice Premier Chen Yi. The TASS news agency's unusually violent reaction precisely indicates that Vice Premier Chen Yi's exposure accurately and forcefully hit the nerve of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

The TASS news agency attempted to make people believe that the U.S. government's claim that the Soviet Union was informed in advance of the decision to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong was merely a "fabricated lie," and that China, in order to serve U.S. imperialism, "eagerly endorsed this lie."

However, if one examines the facts, it becomes clear whether the TASS news agency is "debunking rumors" or spreading them.

On June 29, the United States brazenly bombed Hanoi and Haiphong. On the same day, U.S. State Department spokesman R. W. McGeorge Bundy said at a press conference that the United States had informed "many major relevant governments" of its decision to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong, and that the Soviet Union was one of the "major relevant governments." He said that the United States had been in "continuous contact" with "major relevant countries," including the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, regarding "all aspects of the struggle in Vietnam." He also said, "We have made it clear to the Soviet Union, and will continue to make it clear, the limited nature of our purposes in Southeast Asia." The Associated Press reporter, Jack Reynolds, on the same day also revealed that "the new developments in the situation arose after some cautious consultations between the United States and the Soviet bloc countries."

On June 30, Xinhua News Agency reported Bundy's remarks. On July 5, this newspaper published an editorial exposing the conspiracy between the United States and the Soviet Union to use "bombing to force peace." On the same day, Bundy hurriedly came out to deny that he had said the Soviet Union was one of the "major relevant governments" that the United States had informed in advance of its decision to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong.

On July 10, Vice Premier Chen Yi exposed the conspiracy between the United States and the Soviet Union. On July 11, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State George Ball hurriedly came out to declare that the United States had not "communicated" with the Soviet government in advance. On the same day, the Soviet newspaper Pravda published a short article stating that Bundy's remarks on June 29 were "too absurd" and a "fabrication." Three days later, TASS issued a statement on behalf of the Soviet government to "debunk rumors."

From these facts, one discovers a strange phenomenon: the U.S. government, which, according to TASS, deliberately fabricated a "lie" against the Soviet Union, was more active in repeatedly coming out to deny its own "fabricated lie." The Soviet government, which was supposedly "slandered," merely followed the U.S. government, weakly saying something about "fabrication" and "lies." This is indeed a rare phenomenon.

In fact, it is not surprising. Bundy inadvertently leaked the fact of collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was exposed. If the U.S. government did not come out to deny what it said, would not the role of the Soviet Union as an accomplice in the U.S. conspiracy to use "bombing to force peace" be exposed? Would not the performance of this play by the United States and the Soviet Union be over?

The Soviet revisionist leadership this time is in an awkward situation, having done an awkward thing, and it is really difficult for them to stand up and "debunk rumors" with a clear conscience. To firmly deny that the Soviet Union has any involvement in the U.S. conspiracy to use "bombing to force peace"? But on June 30, the Soviet representative to the Geneva Disarmament Conference, Roschin, stated that the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong would not affect the conclusion of a disarmament agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. How can this be explained? Can the Soviet government say this is also a fabrication? After the United States bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, who was highly favored by the Wall Street bosses, immediately visited Moscow with a so-called peace proposal to reconvene the Geneva Conference. The British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, followed her to Moscow. The U.S. tool, U Thant, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, also wanted to visit Moscow. For a time, Moscow was bustling with activity, with a crowd of dignitaries. Moscow became a marketplace and black market for American-style "peace" brokers. How can this be explained? In the face of these many inexplicable facts, the Soviet government has no courage to "debunk rumors."

The gentlemen of the Soviet revisionist leadership, we are pointing out that you are serving the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to use "bombing to force peace," which is a fact beyond doubt, and we have not wronged you in the slightest. Because of the opposition of the Vietnamese people, because of the opposition of the Chinese people and the people of the world, the U.S. conspiracy did not succeed, and this is not your fault. You have made a great effort this time. Although this double act did not go well, your tricks were exposed and you were embarrassed, it seems that you are not giving up, and you will continue to make efforts in the future.

Whether the Chinese people are serving U.S. imperialism, the world will judge, and we do not need to argue with TASS. Putting the hat on the Soviet revisionist leadership's own head and pushing it onto the heads of the Chinese people is not a good fit. TASS's vile slander against the Chinese people only shows that the TASS, which is supposedly "debunking rumors," is actually a rumor-monger.

　　“辟谣”还是造谣？
　　本报评论员
    陈毅副总理兼外交部长七月十日在北京揭露了美苏勾结对越南人民进行“以炸迫和”的阴谋，使苏联修正主义领导集团恼羞成怒。苏联塔斯社在七月十四日受权发表了一个所谓“辟谣”声明，矢口抵赖美国曾经把轰炸河内、海防的决定事先通知苏联，并且对陈毅副总理进行人身攻击。塔斯社这种暴跳如雷、异乎寻常的做法，恰恰说明陈毅副总理的揭露，准确而有力地打中了苏联修正主义领导集团的要害。
    塔斯社企图让人们相信，美国官方说苏联事先知道美国要轰炸河内、海防，不过是“制造”出来的一种“谎言”，而中国为了替美帝国主义“效劳”，“欣然附和了这种谎言”。
    可是，人们只要看看事实经过，就可以知道，塔斯社究竟是在“辟谣”，还是在造谣。
    六月二十九日，美国悍然轰炸河内、海防。同一天，美国国务院发言人赖特在记者招待会上说，美国曾把轰炸河内、海防的决定告诉“许多主要有关的政府”，而苏联是一个“主要有关的政府”。他说，美国就“越南的斗争的一切方面”同包括英国和苏联在内的“主要有关的国家”“不断进行接触”。他还说，“我们曾经向苏联表明，并将继续向它表明我们在东南亚的目的的有限性”。美联社记者瑞安在同一天也透露，“局势的新发展是在美国和苏联集团国家之间进行了一些小心谨慎的协商以后出现的。”
    六月三十日，新华社报道了赖特的谈话。七月五日，本报发表社论，揭露了美苏勾结进行“以炸迫和”的阴谋。就在这一天，赖特急忙出来，否认他说过苏联是美国事先告诉过轰炸河内、海防的决定的“主要有关的政府”之一。
    七月十日，陈毅副总理揭露了美苏勾结的阴谋。七月十一日，美国副国务卿鲍尔又慌忙出来，表白美国事先“没有同苏联政府通过讯息”。同一天，苏联《真理报》发表了一篇短文，说赖特在六月二十九日说过的话是“太荒谬”的“捏造”。过了三天，塔斯社才代表苏联政府出来“辟谣”。
    从这个事实经过中，人们发现了一件奇怪的事情，这就是据塔斯社说是蓄意对苏联“制造”“谎言”的美国政府，却比苏联政府更加积极地一再出来辟它自己“制造”的“谎言”。而被“诬蔑”的苏联政府，却只是跟在美国政府后面，有气无力地说一些什么“捏造”呀“谎言”呀之类的话。这真是少有的怪现象。
    其实，说来也不奇怪。赖特不小心泄露了美苏串通勾结的事实，被揪住了，被揭露了。如果美国官方不出来否认它说过的话，苏联在美国“以炸迫和”的阴谋中担任的帮凶角色，岂不是原形毕露了吗？美苏两国通力合作的这一台戏，岂不是演不下去了吗？
    苏联修正主义领导集团，这一回是尴尬人办了尴尬事，实在难以理直气壮地站出来“辟谣”。坚决否认苏联同美国的“以炸迫和”的阴谋有丝毫干系吗？可是，六月三十日，参加日内瓦裁军会议苏联代表罗申表示，美国对河内、海防的轰炸，并不影响美苏达成裁军协议，这又如何解释呢？苏联政府能说这也是造谣吗？在美国轰炸河内、海防以后，甚得华尔街老板们青睐的印度总理甘地夫人，双手捧着重新召开日内瓦会议的所谓和平建议，马上访问了莫斯科。美国盟国英国的首相威尔逊紧跟在她的后面到莫斯科访问。美国工具联合国的秘书长吴丹也要访问莫斯科。一时间，莫斯科门庭若市，冠盖如云，好一番热闹景象。莫斯科成了美国式的“和平”掮客们的交易所、黑市场。这又如何解释呢？在这一大堆不可告人的事实面前，苏联政府哪有“辟谣”的勇气呢？
    苏联修正主义领导集团的先生们，我们指出你们为美帝国主义“以炸迫和”的阴谋效劳，只是道出了千真万确的事实，一点也没有冤枉你们。由于越南人民的反对，由于中国人民和全世界人民的反对，美国的阴谋没有得逞，这怪不得你们。你们这一次是很努力的。尽管这出双簧没有演好，你们的把戏漏了底出了丑，看来你们并不死心，今后也还是要继续努力的。
    中国人民是不是在替美帝国主义“效劳”，世界自有公论，我们根本用不着同塔斯社辩论。把苏联修正主义领导集团自己头上的帽子，推到中国人民头上，是对不上号的。塔斯社对中国人民的这种卑劣的诬蔑，只能说明，进行所谓“辟谣”的塔斯社，其实正是一个造谣者。
