A freedom fighter from Southwest Africa recently wrote an article titled "Chairman Mao Zedong is the Greatest Marxist of Our Time" and sent it to our news agency. The article passionately expresses his boundless admiration and love for Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The article begins by stating: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist of our time. This is an objective and indisputable fact. Currently, Mao Zedong Thought is spreading across the globe with the force of a tidal wave and the power of thunder. It is the Leninism of an era where socialism is marching towards global victory and the national liberation movement is delivering devastating blows to the old and new colonialist forces."

The article continues: "Mao Zedong Thought is a highly creative, systematic, and scientific development of Marxism-Leninism. It is also a plain and accessible form of Marxism-Leninism. The content of Chairman Mao's works is extremely rich, yet the language is admirably simple, making it easy for the broad masses of the people to understand and apply.

"Chairman Mao not only brilliantly combines the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution but also with the concrete practice of the world revolution. This is why he rightfully stands alongside Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

The article points out, "All oppressed nations and peoples, all revolutionaries, are looking to the People's Republic of China and placing their hopes in it. Today, an unprecedented scale of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—a movement that imperialists and revisionists dare not launch in their own countries—is sweeping across China. Revolutionaries around the world take pride in this."

The article states: "On the world stage, we see all revolutionaries' growing boundless love for Chairman Mao and his works. All patriotic fighters and cadres highly value Chairman Mao's teachings on the people's army, people's war, armed struggle, establishing revolutionary base areas, and the mass line. Revolutionary peoples of various countries have proven through their own experiences the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's judgments about imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers, about political power growing out of the barrel of a gun, and about the principle of self-reliance. They regard Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings as their highest directive for action." The article further states: "It is precisely these teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong that make him the glorious supreme leader of all revolutionaries and make his doctrine the microscope and telescope for all those who dare to oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism and strive for liberation. Recently, many of my colleagues have begun studying Chairman Mao's works. This is a competition to see who can be the best student of Chairman Mao."

The article concludes: "We are all convinced that the broad masses of the people of Southwest Africa, armed with the thoughts of Chairman Mao Zedong, will be able to overcome all difficulties, sweep away all demons and monsters, and achieve national liberation. Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

    西南非洲一自由战士指出毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思主义者
　　毛泽东思想以排山倒海之势传遍全球  世界革命者以毛主席教导为最高指示
    据新华社十七日讯　西南非洲的一位自由战士最近写了一篇题为《毛泽东主席是当代最伟大的马克思主义者》的文章寄给本社，热情地表达了对毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的无限敬仰和热爱。
    文章首先写道：“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思主义者，这是客观的不容争辩的事实。现在，毛泽东思想正在以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力在全世界传播着，它是社会主义走向全世界胜利、民族解放运动正在给予新老殖民主义势力以毁灭性打击的时代的列宁主义。”
    文章接着写道：“毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的高度的、创造性的、系统的和科学的发展，也是深入浅出的马克思列宁主义。毛主席著作的内容是十分丰富的，但是文字是令人钦佩地朴素，便于广大人民群众了解和运用。
      “毛主席天才地不仅把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合，并且同世界革命的具体实践相结合。这一点就使他理所当然地继马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林之后而与他们齐名。
    文章指出，“一切被压迫的国家和人民，一切革命者都注视着中华人民共和国并把希望寄托在它身上。”“今天，一个空前规模的无产阶级文化大革命运动——帝国主义者和修正主义者决不敢在他们的国家里开展这样的运动——正在中国兴起。各国革命者为此感到自豪。”
    文章说：“在世界舞台上，我们看到所有革命者对毛主席和他的著作日益增长的无限热爱。……所有爱国战士和干部都极其重视毛泽东主席关于人民军队、人民战争、武装斗争、建立革命根据地和关于群众路线的教导。各国革命人民通过自己的经验证明毛泽东同志关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎、关于枪杆子里面出政权的论断以及关于自力更生的原理的正确，并且把毛泽东同志的教导作为自己行动的最高指示。”文章还写道：“正是毛泽东同志的这些教导使他成为所有革命者的光荣的最高领袖，使他的学说成为所有敢于反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义以及争取解放的人们的显微镜和望远镜。最近，我的许多同事都已开始学习毛主席的著作。这是一次竞赛，看谁是毛主席的最好的学生。”
    文章最后说：我们全都确信，用毛泽东主席的思想武装起来的西南非洲的广大人民群众，将会并且能够克服一切困难，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，实现民族解放。“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
