Prince Souphanouvong Cables Chairman Ho Chi Minh

Firmly Supports Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Message to the Nation"

Completely Believes that the Vietnamese People's Anti-American Struggle Will Achieve Complete Victory

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Kengkay on the 24th, the Pathet Lao radio station broadcasted that on the 20th, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, Prince Souphanouvong, cabled Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, expressing firm support for Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Message to the Nation" issued on July 17. The telegram pointed out that while the Johnson administration is taking crazy war actions, it is also spreading the deceitful "peace talks" rhetoric, attempting to deceive world public opinion and cover up its aggressive and warlike nature.

The telegram said that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Message to the Nation" expressed the resolute will of the 31 million Vietnamese people to defeat the American aggressors.

The telegram pointed out: "The Vietnamese people are determined to defeat the American aggressors, not only for their own country's independence and unity, but also for the freedom and peace of the whole world."

The telegram said that the Lao people and the Vietnamese people have a common enemy, the American imperialist invaders, and the two countries are closely related neighbors. The Lao people are very happy and admire the great victories achieved by the heroic Vietnamese people in their anti-American national salvation struggle, and regard these victories as their own victories.

The telegram said that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Message to the Nation" is "not only a sacred command to mobilize all the Vietnamese people to fight against the enemy and save the country, but also a great encouragement to our Lao people's anti-American national salvation struggle."

"The Lao people and the Lao patriotic forces, taking the heroic Vietnamese people as an example, will not retreat in the face of the American imperialists' plot to strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Laos, and are determined to foil all their military adventurist plans, and regard this action as a practical support for the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle."

The telegram said: "The Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao people firmly believe that the only correct way to solve the Vietnamese problem is the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and there is no other way."

The Lao people completely believe that no matter how stubborn and adventurous the American imperialists are, they cannot escape a heavy defeat. The heroic Vietnamese people will definitely achieve complete victory.

On the 19th, Prince Souphanouvong also cabled the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, Nguyen Huu Tho. The telegram reiterated that the Lao patriotic military and people will firmly unite with the Vietnamese people to fight against the common enemy, American imperialism, to the end.

On the 19th, Prince Souphanouvong also cabled the Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho, warmly praising the brilliant victories achieved by the South Vietnamese people in their anti-American national salvation struggle. The telegram said: "The Lao people are very admiring and happy about the brilliant victories of the South Vietnamese people. The Lao people are willing to learn from the example of the strong fighting spirit of the South Vietnamese people and the liberation armed forces, determined to defeat all new military adventurist plans of the American imperialists and their lackeys, and regard this action as the most practical support for the South Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle."

    完全相信越南人民抗美斗争一定取得彻底胜利
    据新华社康开二十四日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王二十日打电报给越南民主共和国主席胡志明，表示坚决支持胡志明主席七月十七日发表的《告全国同胞书》。电报指出，约翰逊政府在采取疯狂的战争行动的同时，还大肆散布狡诈的“和平谈判”论调，妄图欺骗世界人民舆论，掩盖它的侵略和好战的本质。
    电报说，胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》表达了三千一百万越南人民决心战胜美国侵略强盗的坚定意志。
    电报指出：“越南人民决心战胜美国侵略强盗，不仅是为了自己祖国的独立和统一，而且还为了全世界的自由与和平。”
    电报说，老挝人民和越南人民有着共同的敌人美帝国主义侵略者，两国是唇齿相依的邻邦。老挝人民对英雄的越南人民在抗美救国事业中取得的巨大胜利感到非常高兴和钦佩，并且把这些胜利看作是自己的胜利。
    电报说，胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》，“不仅是动员越南全体人民奋起杀敌救国的一项神圣的命令，而且也是对我们老挝人民的抗美救国战斗的一个巨大的鼓舞力量。
    “老挝人民和老挝爱国力量以英雄的越南人民为榜样，在美帝国主义加强和扩大侵略老挝战争的阴谋面前绝不退缩，决心挫败它的一切军事冒险计划，并且把这种行动看作是对越南人民的抗美救国战斗的一个切实的支援。”
    电报说：“老挝爱国战线党和老挝全体人民肯定地认为：解决越南问题的唯一正确途径是越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，除此以外，没有其它途径。”
    老挝人民完全相信：不管美帝国主义怎样地顽固和冒险，它也无法摆脱惨重的失败。英雄的越南人民一定取得彻底胜利。
    苏发努冯亲王十九日打电报给越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团主席孙德胜。电报重申，老挝爱国军民坚决同越南人民团结起来，为反对共同的敌人美帝国主义而战斗到底。
    苏发努冯亲王十九日还打电报给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿，热烈赞扬越南南方人民在抗美救国斗争中取得的辉煌胜利。电报说：“老挝人民对越南南方人民的辉煌胜利非常钦佩和高兴。老挝人民愿意学习越南南方人民和解放武装力量坚强战斗的榜样，决心打败美帝国主义及其走狗的一切新的军事冒险计划，并且把这种行动看作是支持越南南方人民抗美救国斗争的最切实的行动。”
