The "Beijing Mass Rally in Support of the Vietnamese People's Struggle Against U.S. Aggression for National Salvation" is now beginning.

Comrades and Friends:

President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a "Letter to the Nation" on July 17, solemnly declaring that the Vietnamese people are united as one, unafraid of all hardships and sacrifices, and determined to thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism. President Ho Chi Minh's words express the voice of the 31 million Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. They boost the morale of all oppressed nations and peoples, and strike a blow to the arrogance of U.S. imperialism.

In recent days, the people of various places in Vietnam have been stirred with indignation, actively responding to President Ho Chi Minh's call to arms. This is a powerful response to the U.S. imperialists' savage bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong and their "bombing for the sake of negotiations." It is also a heavy blow to the chief accomplice of U.S. imperialism—the Soviet revisionist leading clique—which is stepping up its implementation of the U.S. "peace talks" plot.

The workers, peasants, soldiers, and broad masses of the Chinese people share the same hatred and hardships with the Vietnamese people. Today, we are holding this grand rally to express our firm support for President Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Nation" and to pay our highest respects to the fighting Vietnamese people. We reaffirm that the 700 million Chinese people are determined to be the Vietnamese people's rear guard, providing them with full support in their sacred struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation until the Vietnamese people achieve final victory!

The U.S. aggressors must be driven out of Vietnam, every last one of them! If they do not withdraw, we will annihilate them all!

    在首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会上
    李雪峰同志的开会词
    新华社二十二日讯　中共中央书记处书记、中共北京市委第一书记、全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李雪峰同志在首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会上致开会词。开会词全文如下：
    “首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会”现在开始。
    同志们，朋友们：
    越南民主共和国胡志明主席在七月十七日发表了《告全国同胞书》，庄严宣告越南人民团结一致，不怕一切艰苦和牺牲，决心彻底战胜美帝国主义。胡志明主席的话，表达了三千一百万越南人民抗美救国的心声，长了一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民的志气，灭了美帝国主义的威风。
    这几天，越南各地，群情激昂，积极响应胡志明主席的战斗号召。这是对美帝国主义狂轰滥炸河内和海防、“以炸迫和”的有力回答，是对美帝国主义的头号帮凶——苏联修正主义领导集团加紧推行美国“和谈”阴谋的沉重打击。
    中国的工人、农民、解放军官兵和广大群众，和越南人民同仇敌忾，患难与共。我们今天举行盛大的集会，就是为了表示对胡志明主席《告全国同胞书》的坚决支持，为了向战斗中的越南人民致崇高的敬意。我们重申，七亿中国人民誓为越南人民的后盾，全力支援越南人民抗美救国的神圣事业，直到越南人民取得最后胜利！
    美国强盗必须一个不剩地从越南滚出去！它们不撤走，就把它们统统消灭掉！
