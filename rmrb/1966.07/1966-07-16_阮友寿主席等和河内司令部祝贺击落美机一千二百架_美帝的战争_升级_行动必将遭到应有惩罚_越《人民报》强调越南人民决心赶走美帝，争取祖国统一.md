Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho and the Hanoi Command Congratulate the Shooting Down of 1,200 US Aircraft
The US Imperialists' War "Escalation" Will Surely Meet Its Deserved Punishment
The Vietnamese People's Newspaper Emphasizes the Vietnamese People's Determination to Drive Out the US Imperialists and Strive for National Unification

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, July 15th: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front and the Deputy Commander of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, Nguyen Thi Binh, sent a joint telegram on the 15th to the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, warmly congratulating the military and people of North Vietnam on their brilliant victory of shooting down 1,200 US aircraft.

	The telegram pointed out that the US-Saigon puppets have suffered a military defeat and are politically more isolated than ever. The victories achieved by the military and people of North Vietnam resonate with the victories won by the military and people of South Vietnam at the beginning of the rainy season, strongly encouraging the military and people of both North and South to actively launch a competition in the anti-US, national salvation campaign.

	The telegram expressed that the people of South Vietnam and the liberation armed forces, taking the determination of the military and people of North Vietnam to defeat the US aggressors as an example, will fight more fiercely, continuously, and strike everywhere, annihilating and disintegrating more enemies, making the US-Saigon puppets, who suffered a defeat in the dry season, further collapse in the rainy season.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, July 14th: The Command of the Armed Forces of the Capital Hanoi sent a telegram on the afternoon of the 14th to the Anti-Aircraft and Air Force Command, warmly congratulating the Vietnam People's Air Force on the brilliant achievement of shooting down the 1,200th US aggressor aircraft on the 14th.

	The telegram said that the Vietnamese military and people are completely capable of defeating the US imperialists' war of aggression in any situation. Every "escalation" of war by the US in Vietnam will surely be crushed, and all its evil deeds will surely meet their deserved punishment.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, July 15th: The Vietnamese People's Newspaper published an editorial on the 15th stating: As long as there is one invader on Vietnamese soil, the Vietnamese people will continue to fight, driving out the US aggressors with force.

	The article pointed out that US President Johnson's war-mongering speech on July 12th in West Virginia further exposed the most stubborn and shameless faces of the Johnson clique as invaders. The Vietnamese people want to warn the Johnson clique: Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese people. Vietnam is a whole, and the Vietnamese people are a whole. The 31 million Vietnamese people are determined to drive out the US invaders and strive for the independence and unification of their own country. As long as there is one invader on Vietnamese soil, the Vietnamese people will continue to fight to the end.

	The article pointed out that the Vietnamese military and people have already achieved great military victories, and the US aggressors' attempt to prolong the war to intimidate the Vietnamese people is completely futile. The Vietnamese people have already responded to this provocation. The Vietnamese people have been fighting with them for more than ten years and are prepared to fight for another ten, twenty years, or even longer. The patriotic spirit of the Vietnamese nation, the hatred and unity against the US aggressors, and the resolve of the 31 million Vietnamese people to fight to the end are boundless. These factors are the invincible power of the people's war.

　　阮友寿主席等和河内司令部祝贺击落美机一千二百架
　　美帝的战争“升级”行动必将遭到应有惩罚
　　越《人民报》强调越南人民决心赶走美帝，争取祖国统一
    新华社河内十五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿和越南南方解放武装力量指挥部副司令阮氏定，十五日联名打电报给越南祖国战线中央委员会和越南人民军总司令部，热烈祝贺越南北方军民击落美国飞机一千二百架的辉煌胜利。
    电报指出，美伪集团在军事上遭到惨败，在政治上空前孤立。越南北方军民取得的胜利同越南南方军民雨季初期取得的战功互相呼应，强烈地鼓舞着南、北两方军民积极展开抗美救国竞赛。
    电报表示，越南南方人民和解放武装力量以越南北方军民战胜美国侵略强盗的决心为榜样，将打得更猛，连续地打，到处出击，歼灭和瓦解更多的敌人，使得在旱季中遭到惨败的美伪集团，在雨季中进一步崩溃。
    新华社河内十四日电　越南首都河内武装力量司令部十四日下午打电报给防空、空军司令部，热烈祝贺越南人民空军十四日击落第一千二百架美国强盗飞机的辉煌战功。
    贺电说，越南军民完全有可能在任何情况下打败美帝国主义的侵略战争。它在越南的每一次战争“升级”必定被粉碎，它的一切罪恶行动都必将遭到应有的惩罚。
    新华社河内十五日电　越南《人民报》十五日发表一篇评论员文章说：只要在越南土地上还有一个侵略者，越南人民就要继续战斗，用武力把美国强盗赶出越南。
    文章指出，美国总统约翰逊七月十二日在西弗吉尼亚州发表的好战演说，更加揭穿了约翰逊集团的最顽固和最恬不知耻的侵略者的面目。越南人民要正告约翰逊集团：越南是越南人的。越南是一个整体，越南人民是一个整体。越南三千一百万人民坚决要把美国侵略者赶走，争取自己祖国的独立和统一。只要在越南土地上还有一个侵略者，越南人民就要继续战斗到底。
    文章指出，越南军民在军事上已经取得巨大胜利，美国侵略者想以延长战争来恫吓越南人民是完全徒劳的。越南人民早就回答了这一挑衅。越南人民已经同它打了十多年，并将准备再打十年、二十年或更长的时间。越南民族的爱国主义精神，对美国强盗的仇恨和团结力量，三千一百万越南人民的决战决胜意志，是无穷无尽的。这些因素就是人民战争的无敌力量。
