	Wuxi Flavor Factory Breaks "Foreign Authority" and Extracts World's Latest Seasoning

	The workers of Wuxi City Tianxing Flavor Factory, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have smashed "foreign authority," dared to think and act boldly, and successfully extracted glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid from bacterial cell debris in fermentation liquid.

	Glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid are a newly discovered type of seasoning in the world. When used together with the current market's monosodium glutamate, it can increase the freshness of monosodium glutamate by more than forty times. Its by-products also have certain special medicinal value.

	Extracting this product is extremely difficult. It requires the use of a high-speed centrifuge that rotates at 8,000 to 15,000 revolutions per minute to break down and separate the bacterial cell debris, followed by acid washing to extract it. Capitalist countries have hyped this technology as the "chemistry of chemistry" and have vigorously imposed a technological blockade on our country. However, despite this, the workers of Tianxing Flavor Factory, with a fearless revolutionary spirit, have finally extracted the first batch of samples. After being identified by the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry, the product quality is good.

    无锡味精厂大破“洋权威”
    提取出世界最新调味品
    无锡市天星味精厂职工以毛泽东思想为武器大破“洋权威”，敢想敢闯，从发酵液细菌尸体中提取肌甙酸和鸟甙酸获得成功。
    肌甙酸和鸟甙酸是世界上新近发现的一种新型调味品。它与目前市场上的味精一起使用，可以使味精鲜度增加四十倍以上。它的副产品还具有某种特殊的药用价值。
    提取这种产品非常困难，必须使用每分钟八千至一万五千转的高速离心机，把细菌的尸体打碎加以分离酸洗后才能提取。资本主义国家把这一项技术吹嘘为“化学之中的化学技术”，竭力对我国进行技术封锁。但是，尽管如此，天星味精厂的职工们，发扬了大无畏的革命精神，终于提取了第一批样品。经上海生物化学研究所鉴定，产品情况良好。
