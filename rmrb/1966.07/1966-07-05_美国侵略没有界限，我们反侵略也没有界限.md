Since June 29, U.S. imperialism has been conducting large-scale bombings on the capital Hanoi and the second-largest city Haiphong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This is an extremely savage and rampant act of war taken by U.S. imperialism. People of the world must be highly vigilant and resolutely smash the U.S. imperialists' mad war adventures!

On July 3, the Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' heinous and aggressive war actions, and reaffirming the unshakable and resolute stance of the 700 million Chinese people in aiding Vietnam and resisting the U.S. The people of our country resolutely support the statement of our government, and express indignation at the U.S. imperialists' mad aggression against our closest socialist brother and neighbor. We are ready at any time to take all necessary actions to support the Vietnamese people, according to the interests and demands of the Vietnamese people.

The U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam has long since violated the Geneva Accords. From the day the first U.S. bomb was dropped on North Vietnam, it broke the boundary between South and North Vietnam. Now, the U.S. imperialists are bombing the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, pushing the war of aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious stage. Thus, the Geneva Accords have been completely violated, and the war has no boundaries.

The Johnson administration, while dropping bombs on Hanoi and Haiphong and escalating the war in Vietnam, shamelessly repeats the old tune that the people of North Vietnam supporting their compatriots in the South is "aggression," while their bombing of North Vietnam is not "aggression," not a "war action," but merely a "retaliatory attack." They claim that the U.S. has "limited" objectives in Vietnam and is taking a "restrained" military attitude. This is sheer nonsense!

The logic of U.S. imperialism is the logic of a bandit. The U.S. has sent nearly 300,000 troops across the ocean to Vietnam to kill and burn, and this is not called "aggression." But is it not aggression for the Vietnamese people to fight on their own soil to defend their motherland? The U.S. air pirates bomb North Vietnam, from the 17th parallel all the way to the Vietnam-China border, bombing the capital of the Vietnamese people. This is not called a "war action." What, then, is a "war action"? Why can you invade others, but the Vietnamese people cannot support their own flesh and blood? Why can you escalate the war of aggression without limits, but others must be restrained in their anti-aggression war? You can bomb and invade as you please, but others must be limited. There is no such convenient thing in the world! The U.S. aggressors should understand that the era when only imperialists could invade and others could not retaliate has long passed.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "We say 'imperialism is very ferocious,' meaning that its nature is unchangeable. Imperialist elements will never lay down their butcher's knives; they will never become Buddhas until their doom." This is an unshakable truth. Countless facts prove that the U.S. imperialists' aggressive ambitions are boundless. After World War II, U.S. imperialism implemented a global counter-revolutionary strategy, extending its claws to every corner of the world, suppressing the revolutionary movements of the world's people, and doing all sorts of evil. We have long seen through the insatiable aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism.

The U.S. imperialists' war of aggression against Vietnam aims to permanently occupy South Vietnam, using it as a base to invade North Vietnam, invade the entire Indochina, invade China, and invade the whole of Asia. The U.S. aggressors' cries of "limited," "restrained," "retaliatory," etc., are all pretexts, all euphemisms for expanding, escalating, and madly invading. All of this cannot hide the aggressive and warlike nature of U.S. imperialism.

We must warn the U.S. aggressors in clear language: since you have broken the boundaries of war with your aggressive war actions, then the entire Vietnamese people's counterattack against the U.S. aggressors will not be constrained by anything, and all truly supportive countries and peoples of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. war will also not be constrained by anything. The next step of the war will not be up to you. Since you can come from the air and the sea, why can't others come from the land?

The people of the world can see clearly that U.S. imperialism is the aggressor, and the Vietnamese people are the victims. The war being waged in Vietnam is a war of aggression and anti-aggression between, on the one hand, U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, and on the other hand, the entire Vietnamese people and the revolutionary peoples of the world. Whatever methods the Vietnamese people use to defend their motherland, and whatever methods the people of North Vietnam use to support their compatriots in the South, are just and are their sacred rights. Whatever methods all truly anti-U.S. imperialist countries and peoples use to support the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation war are just and are their sacred rights.

Chairman Mao said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power."

The U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong appears ferocious, but in reality, it is a sign of their failure in the Vietnam War, their internal and external difficulties, their desperation, and their exposure of their paper tiger nature. The U.S. aggressors are sinking deeper and deeper into the vast sea of the Vietnamese people's war, and their effective forces are being annihilated more and more. The various "peace talks" tricks played by the Johnson administration have burst like soap bubbles, one after another. They can neither fight nor deceive, and in this situation, the U.S. aggressors are trying to find a way out from the cracks, using air raids to blackmail and force a "peace talks" situation, trying to intimidate the Vietnamese people into stopping their anti-U.S. struggle. This is sheer delusion!

Johnson's recent series of speeches have openly admitted his policy of intimidating others into surrender. On the one hand, he threatens the Vietnamese people, shouting that he will "continue" and raise the level of the Vietnam War to any necessary extent; on the other hand, he spreads the air of "peace talks," saying that he is "ready to send my closest and most trusted associates to a negotiation site within a few hours." The foolish and tragic U.S. imperialists have completely underestimated the Vietnamese people's firm resolve to resist aggression and the powerful force of the Chinese people and the world's revolutionary peoples supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. struggle. The heroic Vietnamese people are absolutely unyielding and unyielding. The U.S. imperialists have waged war in Vietnam for seven long years, using more brutal, inhuman methods than Hitler, but they have not intimidated the Vietnamese people. Do they think they can intimidate the Vietnamese people now?

Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam solemnly declared in December 1965: "Vietnam is one country, and the Vietnamese nation is one entity. As flesh and blood compatriots, the people of the North will wholeheartedly support the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle of their compatriots in the South, just as the people of the South will wholeheartedly contribute to the defense of their own country in the North." He also said: "We will not surrender to the U.S. imperialists' aggression," "Our people are determined to fight, to bear sacrifices, for ten years, twenty years, or even longer, until we achieve complete victory." Chairman Ho Chi Minh's words fully express the unshakable will and determination of the entire Vietnamese people to resist U.S. imperialist aggression.

This time, the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is the product of the dirty political dealings between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, a product of their collusion. The Johnson administration admitted that before the bombing, they had informed "many major concerned governments" of their decision to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong, and the Soviet Union was one of the "major concerned governments." They also admitted that the U.S. had "continuous contact" with the Soviet Union and other countries on "all aspects of the struggle in Vietnam," and that there had been "some cautious consultations" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. After the bombing, on June 30, the Soviet representative Roshchin at the Geneva Disarmament Conference expressed that the U.S. air raids did not affect the possibility of a U.S.-Soviet disarmament agreement. In response to reporters, he shamelessly said: "If we did not think there was such a possibility, we would not be here." This exposed the black curtain of the U.S. and the Soviet Union exchanging information and colluding on the Vietnam issue. One bombs from the air, and the other pulls from the ground, one bombs and one pulls, all for the evil purpose of "bombing for peace."

To cover up their shameful deeds, the Soviet government issued a statement, hypocritically condemning the U.S. bombing. However, in this statement, the Soviet revisionist leadership also exposed their true colors. They maliciously said, "The road to peace in Vietnam is to stop foreign aggression and stop interference in the internal affairs of the Vietnamese people." In Vietnam, apart from U.S. imperialist aggression and interference, what other foreign aggression and interference is there? The Soviet revisionist leadership's rhetoric, apart from covering up for U.S. imperialism, also maliciously slanders and opposes the Chinese people and other peoples who support the Vietnamese people.

The Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with U.S. imperialism, playing the big trick of "bombing for peace," is a continuation of their consistent policy of fake support and real betrayal on the Vietnam issue. They pretend to do a little anti-U.S. action to cover people's eyes and gain political capital, but in reality, they are actively engaged in treacherous activities, serving the U.S. imperialists' war blackmail policy. They promote détente and disarmament in Europe, allowing the U.S. to free up its hands to invade Vietnam and suppress the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. When the U.S. is arbitrarily expanding the Vietnam War, they fiercely slander China for being "war-like." They fabricate lies everywhere, slandering China for obstructing the passage of aid to Vietnam, to destroy the fighting unity between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples and the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation war. They sing in unison with the U.S., enthusiastically carrying out "joint actions," but under the banner of "joint actions," they fiercely attack us, accusing us of not selling out to U.S. imperialism with them. Thus, they both encourage the Johnson administration to expand the war adventure and help the Johnson administration carry out the "peace talks" deception. They are the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism in destroying the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle.

U.S. imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Vietnamese people. When the U.S. butchers' knives are coming at the Vietnamese people, how can one imagine the Vietnamese people negotiating with the executioners? As long as there is one U.S. soldier on Vietnamese soil, there can be no peace in Vietnam. The Soviet revisionist leadership uses all kinds of tricks to make the Vietnamese people accept the "peace talks" of kneeling surrender, which is a great insult to the heroic Vietnamese people.

Why is the Soviet revisionist leadership so eager to serve the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" plot? In short, it is to bring the Vietnam issue into the track of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to rule the world," to sell out Vietnam in exchange for the so-called "peace" granted by the U.S. big boss. This time, the Johnson administration's bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong and its evil plot of "bombing for peace" is another big exposure of the face of U.S. imperialist aggression and the treacherous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

Chairman Mao said: "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their last struggles against revolutionary forces, and some revolutionaries are often deceived by this external strength for a period, failing to see that the enemy is about to be annihilated and they are about to win."

There are some people in the world who love peace, oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and war, and sympathize with the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation struggle. Their attitude is welcome. However, if they overestimate the strength of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices and underestimate the strength of the Vietnamese people and the world's people, if they fear the expansion of the Vietnam War and always hope to promote "peace talks," they will waver in the face of U.S. imperialist war blackmail and fall into the trap of the U.S. "peace talks" deception. This will only be beneficial to U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and will only encourage the Johnson administration's warlike spirit.

At present, the question facing all oppressed nations and peoples in the world is: they must abandon illusions about U.S. imperialism, abandon illusions about the Soviet revisionist leadership, believe in the power of the masses, rely on the power of the masses, and resolutely rise up to fight to achieve their liberation. Apart from this, there is no other choice.

The Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation struggle is the focus of the current international struggle. The attitude towards the Vietnam War is a touchstone for whether one is truly anti-imperialist or fake, truly revolutionary or fake, revolutionary or counter-revolutionary, Marxist-Leninist or revisionist. All truly anti-U.S. imperialist revolutionary forces will use all methods and means to support the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation struggle.

The Chinese people and the Chinese government have always been unconditionally supportive of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation struggle. We have always supported the Vietnamese people in all aspects, politically, morally, materially, and otherwise, and we will continue to strongly support the Vietnamese people until we drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam. Now, the U.S. imperialists have pushed the war of aggression to a new and more serious stage. As a socialist country and a brotherly neighbor of Vietnam, we must, according to the interests and demands of the Vietnamese people, take all necessary actions at any time. The U.S. imperialists have no boundaries in expanding the Vietnam War, and China's support for Vietnam and resistance to the U.S. also has no boundaries.

The Chinese government and Premier Zhou Enlai have repeatedly solemnly declared that the Chinese people keep their word, China is prepared, and if the war breaks out, there will be no boundaries. Whether it is Vietnam, or Asia, Africa, Latin America, or any country in the world suffering from aggression by imperialism led by the U.S., the Chinese government and people will definitely support and aid them. If this just action leads to U.S. aggression against China, we will resolutely strike back, no matter how many U.S. aggressors come, we will definitely, resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate them.

The heroic Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation struggle has already achieved great victories. The Vietnamese people have demonstrated the great power of people's war. In the South, they have fought the nearly 300,000 U.S. aggressors to a standstill, annihilating more than 50,000 U.S. aggressors; in the North, in the fierce battles to annihilate the U.S. air pirates, they have shot down more than 1,000 U.S. planes. Before the Vietnamese people lies a great situation. Whether in Vietnam, or in Asia and the world, U.S. imperialism is in an unprecedentedly isolated and extremely difficult situation. A new and greater anti-U.S. storm is rising. The day of the burial of U.S. imperialism is not far off.

The Vietnamese people will win! U.S. imperialism will be defeated!

The people of the world will win! U.S. imperialism will be defeated!

### 美国侵略没有界限，我们反侵略也没有界限

    美国侵略没有界限，我们反侵略也没有界限
    六月二十九日以来，美帝国主义对越南民主共和国的首都河内和第二大城市海防，连续进行大规模轰炸。这是美帝国主义所采取的一个极其野蛮极其猖獗的战争行动。全世界人民必须百倍警惕，坚决粉碎美帝国主义疯狂的战争冒险！
    七月三日，中华人民共和国政府发表声明，最强烈地谴责美帝国主义这种罪恶滔天的侵略和战争行动，重申七亿中国人民援越抗美的不可动摇的坚定立场。我国人民坚决拥护我国政府的声明，对美帝国主义疯狂侵略我们最亲密的社会主义兄弟邻邦，表示无比的愤慨，随时准备根据越南人民的利益和要求，采取一切必要的行动，支援兄弟的越南人民。
    美帝国主义侵略越南，早就破坏了日内瓦协议。从美帝国主义的第一颗炸弹扔到越南北方的那一天起，它就打破了越南南方和北方的界限。现在，美帝国主义轰炸越南民主共和国首都，就把侵略越南的战争推进到一个新的更加严重的阶段。这样，日内瓦协议就被破坏无遗，战争就更没有界限了。
    约翰逊政府一面向河内、海防扔炸弹，把侵越战争大大升了一级，一面居然重弹滥调，说什么越南北方人民支援自己的南方同胞，是“侵略”，而它轰炸越南北方却不是“侵略”，不是“战争行动”，只不过是“报复攻击”，说什么美国在越南的“目的是有限的”，“在军事上采取克制态度”，等等。这不是活见鬼吗！
    美帝国主义的逻辑，是地地道道的强盗逻辑。美国派了近三十万军队远涉重洋，从万里之外跑到越南南方来杀人放火，这不叫“侵略”，难道越南人民在自己的国土上，为保卫祖国而战，反而叫做“侵略”吗？美国空中强盗对越南北方进行狂轰滥炸，从十七度线一直炸到越中边境，炸到越南人民的首都，这不叫“战争行动”，究竟什么才叫做“战争行动”？为什么你们可以侵略人家，而越南人民反而不能支援自己的骨肉同胞？为什么你们可以把侵略战争无限制地升级，而别人进行反侵略战争，却要受到约束？你们自己想打就打，想炸就炸，想扩大就扩大，对别人想限制就限制，世界上那有这样便宜的事！美国侵略者应该懂得，只许你们帝国主义侵略，不许别人反击的时代，早就一去不复返了。
    毛主席指出：“我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”这是一条颠扑不破的真理。无数事实证明，美帝国主义的侵略野心是无止境的。第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义实行反革命全球战略，把它的魔爪伸向世界各地，镇压世界人民的革命运动，干尽了坏事。对美帝国主义的这种贪得无厌的侵略本性，我们早就看透了。
    美帝国主义侵略越南战争的如意算盘是，永远占领越南南方，把越南南方作为它侵略越南北方、侵略整个印度支那、侵略中国、侵略整个亚洲的基地。美国侵略者叫喊什么“有限”、“克制”、“报复”等等，统统都是幌子，都是扩大侵略、升级侵略、疯狂侵略的代名词。所有这一切，都掩盖不了美帝国主义的侵略和战争本性。
    我们要用十分清楚的语言警告美国侵略者，你们既然用侵略的战争行动，打破了战争的界限，那么，越南全体人民反击美国侵略者，就不受任何约束了，一切真正支持越南人民抗美战争的国家和人民，也就不受任何约束了。战争的下一步打法，就由不得你们了。你们既然能够从空中来，从海上来，难道别人就不能从陆上去吗？
    全世界人民都看得很清楚，美帝国主义是侵略者，越南人民是被侵略者。在越南所进行的这场战争，是以美帝国主义和它的帮凶为一方，以越南全体人民和全世界革命人民为一方的侵略和反侵略的战争。越南人民不管采取什么办法来保卫自己的祖国，越南北方人民不管采取什么办法来支援南方的骨肉同胞，都是正义的，都是他们的神圣权利。世界上一切真正反对美帝国主义的国家和人民，不管采取什么办法来支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，都是正义的，都是他们的神圣权利。
    毛主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”
    美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防，表面上气势汹汹，实际上是它在侵越战争中惨遭失败、内外交困、狗急跳墙的表现，是它在坚强不屈的英雄的越南人民的沉重打击下陷入穷途末路的表现，是它的日子越来越不好过的表现，是它外强中干纸老虎本质的又一次大暴露。美国侵略者在越南人民战争的汪洋大海里愈陷愈深，它的有生力量被歼灭的越来越多。约翰逊政府玩弄的形形色色的“和谈”骗局，象肥皂泡一样一个接一个地破灭。它打又打不赢，骗又骗不了，在这种情况下，美国侵略者企图从夹缝中找出路，用空袭讹诈来逼出一个“和谈”的局面，吓唬越南人民停止抗美斗争。这真是痴心妄想！
    约翰逊连日来的一系列谈话，对于他所推行的这种吓唬别人投降的政策，作了最露骨的供认。他一面恫吓越南人民，叫嚷要“继续干下去”，要把侵越战争升高到任何必要的水平；一面大放“和谈”空气，说什么他已“准备好在几小时内，把我最亲密和最信赖的同事派到一个会谈的地点去”。愚蠢可悲的美帝国主义者，完全低估了越南人民反侵略的坚强决心，完全低估了中国人民和世界革命人民支援越南人民抗美斗争的强大力量。英雄的越南人民，是绝对压不服、吓不倒的。美帝国主义在越南进行了长达七年之久的战争，使用了比希特勒更残暴的灭绝人性的手段，都没有吓唬得了越南人民，难道现在这样干，就能够把越南人民吓唬住吗！
    越南民主共和国胡志明主席在一九六五年十二月就庄严宣告：“越南是一个国家，越南民族是一个整体。作为骨肉的同胞，北方人民一定全心全力支援南方同胞的抗美爱国斗争，正如南方人民全心全力地为保卫自己祖国的北方而作出贡献一样。”他又说：“我们决不屈服于美帝国主义的侵略”，“我国人民决心坚持战斗，忍受牺牲，不管十年、二十年或更长的时间，直到取得完全胜利。”胡志明主席的话，充分表达了全体越南人民抗击美帝国主义侵略的不可动摇的意志和决心。
    这次美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防，是美苏进行肮脏的政治交易的产物，是它们串通一气搞出来的。约翰逊政府供认，轰炸之前，他们曾经把轰炸河内和海防的决定，告诉“许多主要有关的政府”，而苏联是一个“主要有关的政府”。他们还供认，美国就“越南的斗争的一切方面”，同苏联等国“不断进行接触”，在美国和苏联之间“进行了一些小心谨慎的洽商”。轰炸之后，在六月三十日，参加日内瓦裁军会议的苏联代表罗申就表示，美国的空袭，并不影响苏美达成裁军协议的可能性。他在回答记者时还无耻地说：“如果我们并不认为有这种可能性，我们就不会在这里了。”这就揭开了美苏在越南问题上互通情报、狼狈为奸的黑幕。他们一个在空中炸，一个在地上拉，一炸一拉，都是为了实现“以炸迫和”的罪恶目的。
    为了掩饰自己的可耻勾当，苏联政府发表了一个声明，假惺惺地谴责美国的轰炸。但是，就在这个声明中，苏联修正主义领导集团也露了马脚。他们别有用心地说，“通向越南和平的道路，是停止外国侵略和停止对越南人民内部事务的干涉。”在越南，除了美帝国主义的侵略和干涉，还有什么别的外来侵略和干涉呢？苏联修正主义领导集团的这种论调，除了替美帝国主义打掩护之外，还妄图诬蔑和反对支援越南人民的中国人民和其他各国人民。
    苏联修正主义领导集团勾结美帝国主义，玩弄“以炸迫和”的大阴谋，是它在越南问题上一贯玩弄假支持、真出卖的反动政策的继续。他们表面上搞一点反美小动作，来遮掩人们的耳目，捞取政治资本，实际上大干叛卖活动，积极为美帝国主义的战争讹诈政策效劳。他们在欧洲搞缓和，搞裁军，让美国腾出手来侵略越南，镇压亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动。在美国恣意扩大侵略越南战争的时候，他们却拚命地诋毁中国“好战”。他们到处无中生有地诬蔑中国阻挠援越物资过境，来破坏中越两国人民的战斗团结，破坏越南人民的抗美救国战争。他们同美国一唱一和，“联合行动”搞得很起劲，却又打着“联合行动”的旗号来大肆反华，实际上是攻击我们没有同他们一道去向美帝国主义卖身投靠。这样，他们既鼓励了约翰逊政府扩大战争冒险，又帮助了约翰逊政府推行“和谈”骗局。他们是美帝国主义破坏越南人民革命斗争的头号帮凶。
    美帝国主义是越南人民不共戴天的死敌。当美国强盗的屠刀正在向越南人民杀来的时候，怎么能够设想越南人民去同刽子手谈和呢？只要在越南的土地上还有一个美国兵，就不可能实现越南的和平。苏联修正主义领导集团用尽各种手法，要越南人民接受屈膝投降的“和谈”，这是对英勇的越南人民的莫大侮辱。
    苏联修正主义领导集团这样热中于为美帝国主义“和谈”阴谋效劳，究竟怀的什么鬼胎？说穿了，就是要把越南问题纳入“美苏合作主宰世界”的轨道，就是要出卖越南，换取美国大老爷恩赐的所谓“和平”。这次约翰逊政府轰炸河内、海防和它“以炸迫和”的罪恶勾当，是美帝国主义侵略面目的又一次大暴露，是苏联修正主义领导集团叛徒面目的又一次大暴露。
    毛主席说：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的，而有些革命的人们也往往在一个期间内被这种外强中干的现象所迷惑，看不出敌人快要消灭，自己快要胜利的实质。”
    世界上有一些人，他们爱好和平，反对美帝国主义的侵略战争，同情越南人民抗美救国斗争。他们这种态度是值得欢迎的。但是，如果过高地估计了美帝国主义及其帮凶的力量，过低地估计了越南人民和世界人民的力量，如果害怕越南战火扩大，总是希望促成“和谈”，就会在美帝国主义战争讹诈面前动摇，就会堕入美国“和谈”骗局的罗网。这样做的结果，只会有利于美帝国主义对越南的侵略，只会助长约翰逊政府的战争气焰。
    目前摆在全世界一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民面前的问题是：必须丢掉对美帝国主义的幻想，必须丢掉对苏联修正主义领导集团的幻想，相信人民群众的力量，依靠人民群众的力量，坚决起来进行战斗，才能求得自己的解放。除此以外，没有别的选择。
    越南人民的抗美救国斗争，是当前国际斗争的焦点。对待越南战争采取什么态度，是真反帝还是假反帝，是真革命还是假革命，是革命还是反革命，是马克思列宁主义还是修正主义的试金石。一切真正的反对美帝国主义侵略的革命力量，一定会用一切方法和手段来支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争。
    中国人民和中国政府，从来就是无保留地支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争。我们历来是从政治上、道义上、物质上以及其他方面给予越南人民一切支援，我们还要继续大力支援越南人民，直到把美国侵略者全部赶出越南。现在，美帝国主义把侵略战争推进到一个新的更加严重的阶段，我们作为社会主义国家，作为越南唇齿相依的兄弟邻邦，一定要根据越南人民的利益，根据越南人民的要求，随时采取我们认为必要的行动。美帝国主义扩大侵越战争没有界限，中国的援越抗美也没有界限。
    中国政府和周恩来总理多次郑重声明，中国人民说话是算数的，中国是作了准备的，战争打起来就没有界限了。不论是越南，还是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲或世界上任何国家遭到以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略，中国政府和中国人民是一定要给以支持和援助的。如果由于这种正义行动引起美国侵犯中国，我们将毫不犹豫地给以坚决的打击，不管美国侵略者来多少，我们一定要、也一定能够坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它消灭掉。
    英雄的越南人民抗美救国斗争已经取得了伟大胜利。越南人民，发挥了人民战争的巨大威力。在南方，把近三十万美国侵略军打得焦头烂额，消灭了美国侵略者五万多人；在北方，在痛歼美国空中强盗的战斗中，击落了一千多架美国飞机。展现在越南人民面前的，是一片大好形势。美帝国主义不管是在越南，还是在亚洲和整个世界范围内，都处于空前孤立、极端困难的境地。一个新的更大的反美风暴正在兴起。美帝国主义被埋葬的日子为期不远了。
    越南人民必胜！美帝国主义必败！
    全世界人民必胜！美帝国主义必败！
