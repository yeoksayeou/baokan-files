Foreign scientists attending the 1966 summer physics discussion conference in Beijing have, during their visits and tours in the city, enthusiastically praised the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought and expressed boundless admiration for the tremendous achievements of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Before coming to China, the leader of the Congolese (Brazzaville) scientific delegation, Mu Jib, had studied many of Chairman Mao's works. During his tour, he passionately told Chinese friends, "Mao Zedong Thought is great, it is the truth. It belongs not only to the Chinese people but to all oppressed peoples of the world." A member of the delegation, Ta Ti, said, "China has successfully conducted three nuclear explosions relying entirely on its own strength. This is a tremendous event that greatly inspires all oppressed peoples of the world."

Many scientists visited the Chinese Revolutionary Museum. The leader of the Cambodian scientific delegation, Ji Chun, said that the fighting spirit of the 700 million Chinese people nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought has greatly inspired the Cambodian people. The leader of the Ceylonese scientific delegation, Kan Nangala, said, "After visiting this museum, I understand even more why the Chinese people love Chairman Mao so much."

After visiting the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall and seeing the exhibits on the Dazhai-style agricultural model, the foreign scientists were deeply moved by the self-reliant spirit and heroic spirit of the Dazhai people. Cambodian scientist Ji Chun said, "When a country's people are guided by a correct ideology—Mao Zedong Thought—they can achieve great things. In the face of the 700 million Chinese people, there are no insurmountable difficulties. The stronger China becomes, the more the U.S. imperialists will fear." Myanmar scientist Wu Jiao Min said, "Only under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought could Dazhai achieve such great results in such difficult natural conditions."

Scientists from Algeria, Morocco, Algeria, Sudan, and Syria braved the scorching sun to enthusiastically visit and tour the suburban Chinese-Albanian Friendship People's Commune.

Scientists from 14 countries, including Algeria, Myanmar, North Korea, and Sudan, visited the Institute of Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    北京物理讨论会各国科学家在京参观
    盛赞我国社会主义革命和建设成就
    据新华社二十一日讯　出席北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会的各国科学家，连日来在北京的参观访问中盛赞毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，对中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的巨大成就表示无限钦佩。
    刚果（布）科学家代表团团长穆吉布在来中国以前就学习了不少毛主席著作，这次在参观过程中，他满怀激情地对中国朋友说：“毛泽东思想是伟大的，是真理，它不仅属于中国人民，而且是属于全世界被压迫人民的。”这个代表团的团员塔提说：中国完全依靠自己的力量进行了三次核爆炸，这是一件了不起的重大事件，是对全世界被压迫人民的巨大鼓舞。
    许多科学家参观了中国革命博物馆。柬埔寨科学家代表团团长吉春说，在毛泽东思想哺育下的中国七亿人民的斗争精神，给了柬埔寨人民很大的鼓舞。锡兰科学家代表团团长坎南加拉说，看了这个博物馆，我更加明白了中国人民为什么这样地敬爱毛主席。
    各国科学家到全国农业展览馆参观了大寨式农业典型的展出以后，都被“大寨人”的自力更生精神和“敢教日月换新天”的英雄气概所感动。柬埔寨科学家吉春说：当一个国家的人民为一种正确的思想——毛泽东思想所掌握的时候，就能干出了不起的事业。在七亿中国人民面前，没有战胜不了的困难，中国越强大，美帝国主义就越害怕。缅甸科学家吴叫敏说，只有在毛泽东思想的指引下，大寨才能在非常困难的自然条件下取得这样巨大的成绩。
    阿联、摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、苏丹和叙利亚的科学家们冒着火热的太阳，兴致勃勃地参观访问了郊区中国阿尔巴尼亚友好人民公社。
    阿尔及利亚、缅甸、朝鲜、苏丹等十四个国家的科学家到中国科学院物理研究所参观。
