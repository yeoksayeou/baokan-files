We Asian and African writers, after extensive exchange of experiences and profound analysis, have reached the conclusion: Asian and African literature must serve the people's struggle. At a time when the Asian and African peoples are waging unyielding struggles against imperialism and old and new colonialism, and are entering a great era of cultural revival, we believe that Asian and African literature must serve the revolutionary aspirations of the Asian and African peoples, rather than the interests of the decaying bourgeoisie. Therefore, we call for:

Creating and developing a new culture and literature that is anti-imperialist, revolutionary, and of the people and the nation, using forms that the masses love and appreciate to sing the praises of the Asian and African peoples' revolutionary struggles for national independence and to defend it, to enhance the Asian and African peoples' national pride and self-confidence, to strengthen their fighting spirit, and to solidify their belief in victory;

Persisting in opposing American imperialist cultural aggression, covert ideological infiltration, and spiritual subversion, and waging a long-term, unrelenting struggle against all imperialist, old and new colonialist, and other reactionary and decadent cultures and literatures that numb the people's will, taking various active steps to thoroughly eliminate their harmful influences.

To achieve the above historical tasks, Asian and African writers should:

Strengthen their ties with the masses, understand them, learn from them, serve them, actively participate in the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle, share the same breath and fate with the people, and be their faithful spokespeople;

Strengthen and expand the great unity of Asian and African anti-imperialist writers, support each other, learn from each other, and make the greatest contributions to the common cause of defending and maintaining the independence of Asian and African nations.

The conference was particularly excited to note that in recent years, Asian and African writers have actively created works to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation and reunification, expressing the common voice of the 2 billion people of Asia and Africa. They are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with their Vietnamese brothers and sisters until they drive out every last American aggressor from Vietnam and achieve final victory!

The conference was also particularly excited to note that in the revolutionary struggle of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and its accomplices, and in the struggle to build their own countries, Asian and African writers have continuously produced excellent works, promoting the great development of new Asian and African national culture and literature.

In Vietnam, the great struggle against American aggression for national salvation and reunification has produced a large number of excellent poems, novels, reportage, and other forms of literary works.

In other Asian countries, the struggle to eliminate imperialist cultural poisons and develop national new literature is underway. In Korea, new literature is developing alongside socialist construction and the struggle for national reunification; in Indonesia, progressive national culture and literature are growing and developing through trials by fire and blood; in the struggle against American imperialism and Japanese reactionary policies of aggression in Asia, the democratic literature of the Japanese people is widely developing among the masses; in Pakistan, progressive writers' pens express the voices of the Kashmiri people fighting for the right to self-determination.

In China, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is flourishing, and in the field of literature and art, it has already borne abundant fruits.

In Palestine and other Arab countries, the anti-imperialist voices in literature are growing stronger.

In Angola, Zimbabwe, Azania, and other countries in southern Africa, strong anti-imperialist and anti-fascist colonial poetry and prose have had a positive impact.

In Algeria, Guinea, and other African countries, literature reflecting that Africans are an indivisible whole, whether in sub-Saharan Africa or North Africa, has dealt a heavy blow to "Negritude" literature, which attempts to undermine the anti-imperialist unity of the African continent.

The new literature of all Asian and African countries is playing a tremendous role in mobilizing and inspiring the people to oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism, and is increasingly gaining the attention of the world's people.

The new literature of Asia and Africa, in terms of quality and ideological content, far surpasses the entire literature of imperialism, colonialism, and other reactionary forces. It can be said with certainty that these progressive literary works of Asia and Africa will definitely be widely circulated and, as weapons of the anti-imperialist struggle, will fulfill their historical mission.

We firmly believe that the Asian and African peoples, who have reappeared on the world stage today with a revolutionary and advanced master's identity, will definitely create an even more brilliant new culture and literature in human history!

Therefore, it is decided:

1. To carry out more extensive and in-depth literary activities, actively and massively create anti-imperialist revolutionary literary works, strongly support the current anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various Asian and African countries, especially the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation and reunification, and propagate the truth that the Vietnamese people and the peoples of Asia and Africa will surely win, and American imperialism and all old and new colonialism will surely fail;

2. To thoroughly expose the evil activities of American imperialism and its accomplices in spreading ideological poisons among the Asian and African peoples through films, television, books, newspapers, comic books, and the "Peace Corps," and firmly support the struggles of the peoples of various Asian and African countries to oppose imperialist cultural aggression and develop their own national new culture and literature;

3. To strengthen the translation, introduction, and commentary work of excellent literary achievements among various Asian and African countries, learn from each other, promote each other, be vigilant against the infiltration of Western bourgeois culture and literature in various forms, absorb useful things from the literature of brother countries and the progressive elements of national literary heritage, and develop national new literature;

4. To establish an Asian and African literary publishing house with various Asian and African language publishing capabilities, widely publish excellent works by Asian and African writers, support the establishment and development of progressive publishing and distribution industries in various Asian and African countries, and foster the growth of new Asian and African literature;

5. To organize literary symposiums, review the achievements of progressive literary creation in Asia and Africa, explore some major issues facing the development of new Asian and African culture and literature, and hold various types of literary recitation and radio performances to expand the influence of new Asian and African literature;

6. Progressive literary organizations and writers in various Asian and African countries have the responsibility to collect and popularize excellent literary works and recommend them to the Standing Bureau, pool their strengths, and continue to select and publish the "Asian and African Literature Series" and various collections of Asian and African literature;

7. Further strengthen and support the editorial work of the "Call," enrich its content, publish it monthly, promote mutual understanding among the literary circles of various Asian and African countries, and exchange the situation of Asian and African literature development;

8. Strengthen the accumulation of Asian and African literary research materials, welcome writers from various Asian and African countries to donate various literary books and periodicals to the Standing Bureau, further expand the establishment of the "Asian and African Writers' Library" in Colombo, and if possible, establish some such libraries in other Asian and African countries and regions;

9. Advocate and organize friendly exchanges between writers of various Asian and African countries, strengthen the revolutionary unity of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and counter-revolution, enhance the fighting friendship among Asian and African writers, exchange each other's struggle experiences, and promote Asian and African cultural exchanges;

10. Strengthen the creative conditions for Asian and African writers, such as establishing Asian and African writers' sanatoriums.

专栏：

    关于文学为反帝革命斗争服务的决议
    我们亚非作家经过广泛地交流经验和深刻地分析得出结论：亚非文学必须为人民斗争服务。正当亚非人民进行反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的不屈不挠的斗争、进入文化复兴的伟大时代时，我们认为，亚非文学必须为亚非人民的革命愿望服务，而不是相反，为没落的资产阶级的利益服务。因此，我们呼吁：
    创造和发展亚非反帝革命的、人民大众的、民族的新文化、新文艺，用群众喜闻乐见的民族形式歌颂亚非人民争取与维护民族独立的革命斗争，提高亚非人民争取与维护民族独立的革命斗争，提高亚非人民的民族自尊心、自信心，增强他们的战斗意志，坚定他们的必胜信念；
    坚持反对美帝国主义的文化侵略、隐蔽的思想渗透和精神颠覆，与一切帝国主义、新老殖民主义及其它反动腐朽的、麻痹人民意志的文化和文艺进行长期不懈的斗争，采取各种积极的步骤，以求彻底消除它们的有害影响。
    为了实现上述历史任务，亚非作家应当：
    加强与人民大众的联系，熟悉他们，向他们学习，为他们服务，积极参加反帝革命斗争，与人民同呼吸共命运，做他们忠实的代言人；
    加强和扩大亚非作家反帝革命的大团结，互相支援，彼此学习，为争取与维护亚非民族独立的共同事业作出最大的贡献。
    会议极其兴奋地注意到：近几年来，亚非作家积极地在创作支援越南人民抗美救国、统一祖国斗争的作品，表达了亚非二十亿人民的共同心声，他们决心同越南兄弟姊妹并肩作战，直到把美国侵略者全部彻底赶出越南，取得最后胜利！
    会议还极其兴奋地注意到：在亚非人民反对帝国主义及其帮凶的革命斗争中和建设自己国家的斗争中，亚非作家们不断地写出优秀作品，促进了亚非民族新文化、新文艺的巨大发展。
    在越南，伟大的抗美救国、统一祖国的斗争产生了大量优秀的诗歌、小说、报告文学以及其他形式的文学作品。
    在亚洲其他国家，清除帝国主义的文化毒素，发展民族新文艺的斗争正在进行。朝鲜的新文学随着社会主义建设和统一祖国的斗争一起在发展；印度尼西亚的进步的民族文化和文艺，正在血与火的洗礼中成长和发展；在反对美帝国主义和日本反动派侵略亚洲的政策的斗争中，日本人民的民主的文学正在群众中广泛地发展；在巴基斯坦，进步作家的笔表达了克什米尔人民争取自决权的呼声。
    在中国，社会主义文化大革命正在蓬勃开展，在文学艺术方面已结出了丰硕的果实。
    在巴勒斯坦以及其它阿拉伯国家，文学中反帝的声音越来越强。
    在安哥拉、津巴布韦、阿扎尼亚等非洲南部的国家，强烈反帝的和反对法西斯殖民主义的诗歌与散文已经发生了积极作用。
    在阿尔及利亚、几内亚以及其它非洲国家，反映非洲人是一个不可分割的整体的文学，不管是在撒哈拉以南，还是在撒哈拉以北，都给了“黑人性”文学以沉重的打击，因为“黑人性”文学企图破坏非洲大陆的反帝团结。
    所有亚非各国战斗的新文学正在起着动员人民、鼓舞人民、反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的巨大作用，日益受到世界人民的重视。
    亚非的新文学按其质量来说，按其思想内容来说，远远超过了整个帝国主义、殖民主义和其它反动的文学。可以肯定，亚非这些进步文学作品一定能够得到广泛的流传，作为反帝斗争的武器，必将完成它的历史使命。
    我们坚决相信：以革命的、先进的主人翁身份重新出现在今天世界舞台上的亚非人民，必定能创造出人类历史上从所未有的更加光辉灿烂的新文化、新文艺！
    为此，决定：
    一、开展更为广泛、更为深入的文学活动，积极大量地创作反帝革命文学作品，大力声援亚非各国人民当前的反帝革命斗争，特别是越南人民的抗美救国、统一祖国的斗争，宣传越南人民和亚非人民必胜，美帝国主义和一切新老殖民主义必败的真理；
    二、彻底揭露美帝国主义和它的帮凶通过电影、电视、图书、报刊、连环画报与“和平队”等在亚非人民中散布思想毒素的罪恶活动，坚决支持亚非各国人民为反对帝国主义文化侵略、发展本民族的新文化、新文艺而进行的斗争；
    三、加强亚非各国之间优秀文学成果的翻译、介绍和评论工作，互相学习，彼此促进，警惕西方资产阶级文化和文艺以各种表现形式进行渗透！吸取兄弟文学中有用的东西、各国文学遗产中的进步因素，发展本民族的新文学；
    四、创办拥有各种亚非文字出版能力的亚非文学出版社，广泛出版亚非作家的优秀作品，支持亚非各国进步的出版发行事业的建立和发展，扶植亚非新文学的成长；
    五、组织文学座谈会，检阅亚非进步文学创作的成绩，探讨发展亚非新文化、新文艺所面临的一些重大问题。举办各种类型的文学朗诵会、广播演出会，扩大亚非新文艺的影响；
    六、亚非各国进步的文学组织和进步作家，有责任收集、普及优秀的文学作品，并向常设局推荐，群策群力，以便继续选编出版《亚非文学丛书》和亚非文学的各种选集；
    七、进一步加强和支持《号召》的编辑工作，充实其内容，按月出版，促进亚非各国文学界的彼此了解，交流亚非文学发展的情况；
    八、加强亚非文学研究资料的积累工作，欢迎亚非各国作家向常设局赠寄各种文学的书籍和报刊，进一步扩充设立在科伦坡的“亚非作家图书馆”。如有可能，也在其它亚非国家和地区建立一些这样的图书馆；
    九、提倡并组织亚非各国作家之间的友好往来，加强亚非人民反帝的、反对反革命的革命团结，增进亚非作家的战斗友谊，交换彼此的斗争经验，促进亚非的文化交流；
    十、加强亚非作家的创作条件，例如建立亚非作家疗养院。
