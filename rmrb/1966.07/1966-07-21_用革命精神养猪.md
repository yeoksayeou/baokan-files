The higher authorities allocate us 400 jin of bean pulp each month as pig feed. However, we have 21 pigs, and 400 jin of bean pulp can only last a week. The shortfall is made up by regularly sending people out to gather pig grass. Pigs do not particularly like eating pig grass, and moreover, too much grass makes the pigs not gain weight. For a period, the problem of insufficient feed was not well resolved.

After reading Chairman Mao's books, I learned to use the spirit of Dr. Norman Bethune's extreme responsibility towards work to raise pigs. Lacking pig feed, I cleared land next to the pigpen to plant sweet potatoes, dug ditches to grow water hyacinth, and often carried a pole to temporary dining units like the new recruits' company and training teams to collect rice washing water and leftover soup. Additionally, I strengthened the management of feed, and when feeding, I paid attention to meticulous planning. In this way, by both increasing sources and saving, the pig feed became more than enough, and the company rarely needed to send people to gather pig grass. From then on, every day there was enough coarse and fine feed, and the 21 pigs were fed to be fat and healthy. We also saved a lot of fine feed, stored some green feed, and sent some of the water hyacinth I raised to nearby production brigades.

The transformation from insufficient to abundant pig feed was primarily due to a change in my thinking. Previously, I separated pig raising from the revolution, not raising pigs for the revolution, so I was not extremely responsible in my work. When there was a shortage of pig feed, I would ask the leadership for more, unwilling to think of solutions or take action to solve the problem myself. After studying Chairman Mao's works, my ideological awareness was raised, and I understood that all work is for the revolution, and raising pigs is also a part of revolutionary work, which must be approached with a revolutionary spirit. When there was a shortage of feed, I decided to be self-reliant and give full play to my subjective initiative. In this way, the problem of insufficient feed was solved, and spirit turned into material. Through this matter, I cultivated a revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, and a tough and unyielding style, turning material into spirit.

    用革命精神养猪
    饲养员　潘文才
    上级每月分配给我们四百斤豆渣做猪饲料。可是我们喂了二十一头猪，四百斤豆渣只能喂一个星期。不足部分，就靠经常派人出去打猪草来解决。猪不大欢喜吃猪草；而且，草喂多了，猪不长膘。在一段时间里，饲料不足的问题没有很好解决。
    读了毛主席的书，我学习用白求恩同志对待工作极端负责的精神来养猪。缺少猪饲料，我就在猪圈旁开荒种地瓜，挖水沟养浮莲，还经常挑着担子到新兵连、集训队等临时性的伙食单位搜集淘米水、剩菜汤。此外，我加强了对饲料的保管，喂食时注意精打细算。这样，开源节流，猪饲料就喂不完了，连里也就很少派公差打猪草了。从此，每天都保证有足够的精、粗饲料，二十一头猪喂得膘肥体胖，还节约了不少精饲料，储存了一些青饲料，并且把我养的水浮莲，送了不少给附近的生产队。
    猪饲料从不足到富裕这个转变，首先在于我思想的转变。以前，我把喂猪与革命分割开来，不是为革命而养猪，所以，对待工作就不是极端负责。猪饲料不足，就向领导伸手要，自己不愿意动脑筋想办法、动手解决问题。学习了毛主席著作，提高了思想觉悟，明确了一切工作都是为了革命，养猪也是革命工作的一部分，也必须用革命精神来对待。饲料不足，就决心自力更生，发挥自己的主观能动性。这样，饲料不足的问题解决了，精神变成了物质。通过这件事，培养了自己敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命的思想品质和硬骨头作风，物质又变成了精神。
