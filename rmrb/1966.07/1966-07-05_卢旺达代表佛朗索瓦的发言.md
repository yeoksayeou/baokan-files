Rwanda's representative Karuretwawa Francois said at the general meeting of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers today that the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialism is also the struggle of all Asian and African peoples. We have the responsibility to support it with all our might.

In his speech, he expressed support for the statement issued by the Chinese government on July 3, which firmly supports the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation.

He said that the struggle of the Vietnamese people has set an example for all peoples fighting for independence and freedom.

He then spoke about imperialism's aggression against Central Africa. He condemned the imperialist plot to control Rwanda and Burundi, turning them into bases for suppressing the Congolese people's revolution. He said that in Central Africa, there is a great struggle between revolutionaries and imperialists. To achieve victory, there is only one path: to intensify revolutionary armed struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism in these countries as soon as possible.

In his speech, he also angrily condemned the split and sabotage plots carried out by modern revisionists and their lackeys. He said that the Cairo split conference exposed the true face of modern revisionists, who, while preaching revolution for peace, actually sabotage all genuine revolutionary and peaceful movements and organizations. Their alliance with the number one enemy of the peoples of all countries, American imperialism, is becoming clearer every day.

Francois, in his speech today, said with great emotion, "I pay my respects to the great helmsman of China and the world, the undisputed ideological leader of all Marxist-Leninists of this century, and the most outstanding figure among all revolutionaries of our time, Chairman Mao Zedong."

Francois also expressed support for the proposal by the Indonesian representative, endorsing the holding of the Third Conference of Asian and African Writers in Beijing.

    卢旺达代表佛朗索瓦的发言
    新华社四日讯　卢旺达代表卡鲁雷特瓦·佛朗索瓦今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，越南人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，也是我们所有亚非人民的斗争。我们有责任竭尽全力予以支持。
    他在发言中表示支持中国政府在七月三日发表的关于坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的声明。
    他说，越南人民的斗争为争取独立、自由而斗争的各国人民作出了榜样。
    他接着谈到帝国主义对中非的侵略，他谴责帝国主义控制卢旺达和布隆迪，使之成为镇压刚果人民革命的基地的罪恶阴谋。他说，在非洲中部，革命者和帝国主义之间正有一场大搏斗。为了取得胜利，只有一条道路可走，就是尽早在这些国家里加紧进行反对帝国主义和新殖民主义的革命武装斗争。
    他在发言中还愤怒地谴责现代修正主义者及其走狗进行的分裂破坏阴谋。他说，开罗分裂会议的阴谋暴露了现代修正主义者的真面目，他们口头上高唱要以革命求得和平，但实际上是破坏一切真正的革命与和平运动和组织。他们与各国人民的头号敌人美帝国主义的联盟一天比一天暴露得更加清楚。
    佛朗索瓦在今天的发言中还怀着激动的心情说，“我向中国和全世界的伟大舵手，本世纪所有马克思列宁主义者的无可置疑的思想导师，我们时代所有革命者中最卓越的人物毛泽东主席致敬。”
    佛朗索瓦在发言中表示支持印度尼西亚代表的建议，赞成第三届亚非作家会议在北京举行。
