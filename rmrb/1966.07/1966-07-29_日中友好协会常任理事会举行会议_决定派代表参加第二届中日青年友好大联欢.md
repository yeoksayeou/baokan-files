The Standing Committee of the Japan-China Friendship Association held a meeting on the 17th and decided to accept the invitation from three Chinese organizations (the China-Japan Friendship Association, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation) to send representatives to participate in the second China-Japan Youth Friendship Grand Gathering to be held in Beijing this autumn.

The Japan-China Friendship Association formally notified all prefectural and county-level grassroots organizations of the Japan-China Friendship Association nationwide on the 21st of this decision.

The notification states: "In the serious situation following the U.S. imperialist bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, the task of the Japan-China friendship movement to defend Asian peace has become even more important. The call for strengthening friendship and unity between the peoples of Japan and China is growing stronger. Under such circumstances, we must once again affirm the basic nature and tasks of the movement carried out by the Japan-China Friendship Association, and actively develop Japan-China friendly exchanges based on the history and traditions of the Japan-China Friendship Association."

The notification emphasizes: "No matter what changes occur between Japan and China, we must firmly unite the masses of all strata and actively develop the Japan-China friendship movement."

The notification concludes: "Strengthening the unity of youth in Japan and China and deepening mutual understanding is conducive to the development of the Japan-China friendship movement. We sincerely hope for the success of the China-Japan Youth Friendship Grand Gathering."

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Tokyo Metropolitan Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association and the Japan-China Friendship Associations of various prefectures in the Kanto region held the fifth Japan-China Friendship Youth Summer Camp over two days, the 16th and 17th, at Lake Ashi in Hakone, Kanagawa Prefecture. This summer camp was the largest in recent years, with over 1,200 young students from Tokyo and nine prefectures participating. Representatives of Japanese-Chinese youth students were also invited to attend.

The host of the opening ceremony read a message of congratulations from the All-China Youth Federation to the summer camp, inviting Japanese friends to enthusiastically participate in the second China-Japan Youth Friendship Grand Gathering.

At the closing ceremony on the 17th, a unanimous resolution was passed to send a telegram to Chinese youth from the fifth Japan-China Friendship Youth Summer Camp. The telegram stated that Japan-China friendship is an irresistible historical trend that no force can stop, and the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China is an unbreakable will that no force can destroy. We must contribute to the success of the second China-Japan Youth Friendship Grand Gathering.
