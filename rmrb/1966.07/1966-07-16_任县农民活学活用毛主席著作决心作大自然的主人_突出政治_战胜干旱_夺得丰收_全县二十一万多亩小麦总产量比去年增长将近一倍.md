Ren County farmers study and apply Chairman Mao's works to become masters of nature, emphasize politics, overcome drought, and achieve a bumper harvest. The total production of wheat in the county, covering more than 210,000 mu, nearly doubled compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, July 15 — The people of Ren County in Hebei Province, with Mao Zedong Thought as their banner, have striven hard, overcome drought, and achieved a bumper wheat harvest this year. The total production of wheat in the county, covering more than 210,000 mu, nearly doubled compared to 1965. This fact once again proves that when Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a tremendous material force.

The process of Ren County striving for a bumper wheat harvest is a process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. From last autumn's sowing to this summer's harvest, there has not been a single heavy rain. At the time of wheat sowing, the soil was very dry, and out of the more than 210,000 mu of wheat fields in the county, 160,000 mu were dry land. Some people thought: "The land is dry and water is scarce; as long as we plant the land with sufficient water sources, we will have enough wheat to eat in the future." Some said: "The work of drilling wells to combat drought is too hard and tiring; we should increase work points." Some cadres had a sense of difficulty in combating drought and achieving a bumper harvest. The Ren County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in response to these active thoughts, organized cadres and community members to study Chairman Mao's instructions on class and class struggle, as well as his essays "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Qu Yuan and the Struggle Against Feudalism." They also led the masses to recall the history of revolutionary struggles, recount the bitterness of the old society, and held a great discussion on "For whom do we work?" and "For whom do we farm?" They studied Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to thoroughly criticize conservative, "difficult" and inaction thoughts, and to establish a revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win; to promote proletarian thought and eliminate bourgeois thought; and to further establish the idea of working for the revolution and farming for the revolution.

After Mao Zedong Thought took root in the minds of the farmers of Ren County, they decided to become masters of nature, carry forward the revolutionary spirit, and launched a tenacious struggle against drought. The members of Yongfuzhuang Commune dug soil wells, irrigated the land, and sowed seeds in time, ensuring that more than 13,000 mu of wheat were sown on time. The entire county quickly promoted the experience of Yongfuzhuang, launching a campaign to dig soil wells and sow wheat to combat drought. Soon, more than 27,000 soil wells were dug, 6,500 old wells were repaired, 310 canals were dug, and 95 ponds were excavated. Various places also drilled a batch of new wells. In this way, by building small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, Ren County turned more than 160,000 mu of dry land, accounting for more than 34% of the county's cultivated land, into irrigated land in a few months. As a result, not only was this year's wheat harvest secured, but the foundation for sustained high yields was also laid.

Since last winter, the Ren County Committee of the Communist Party of China has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and adopted various effective measures to arm the farmers with Mao Zedong Thought. Party organizations at all levels have taken the promotion of Mao Zedong Thought as the top priority. All cadres going to work in the countryside have taken organizing the masses to study Chairman Mao's works as their primary task, leading by example in learning, applying, and spreading, and guiding the masses in studying Chairman Mao's works. The entire county has formed a movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This movement played a decisive role in achieving victory in the anti-drought struggle and the wheat harvest.

In summarizing the experience of this year's wheat harvest, the broad masses of cadres and community members in Ren County unanimously agreed: "Of all the principles, the first and foremost is to hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought." The broad masses of cadres and community members have an even deeper love and faith in Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, master Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly overcome all ghosts and monsters, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, making greater contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

　　任县农民活学活用毛主席著作决心作大自然的主人
　　突出政治　战胜干旱　夺得丰收
　　全县二十一万多亩小麦总产量比去年增长将近一倍
    新华社保定十五日电　河北省任县人民以毛泽东思想挂帅，艰苦奋斗，战胜干旱，夺得了今年小麦丰收。全县二十一万多亩小麦的总产量，比一九六五年增长将近一倍。这一事实再一次雄辩地说明，毛泽东思想一旦为广大群众所掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量。
    任县争取小麦丰收的过程，是一个活学活用毛主席著作的过程。这个县从去年秋种到今年夏收，没下过一场透雨。在小麦播种时，地里的干土层很厚，全县二十一万多亩小麦田中有十六万多亩是旱地。有些人认为：天旱水缺，只要把水源充足的地种上，将来收的小麦够吃就行了。有的说：抗旱打井活太苦太累，应该增加工分。有的干部对抗旱夺丰收有畏难情绪。中共任县县委针对这些活思想，组织广大干部和社员学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的指示和《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等文章，并引导群众回忆革命斗争史，诉旧社会的苦，开展了“为谁工作”、“为谁种田”的大讨论。他们学习毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，大破因循守旧、“难”字当头和无所作为的思想，大立敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命思想；大兴无产阶级思想，大灭资产阶级思想；进一步树立了为革命工作、为革命种田的思想。
    任县农民的头脑中有了毛泽东思想以后，决心要作大自然的主人，发扬革命精神，向干旱展开了顽强的斗争。永福庄公社的社员们随挖土井，随提水浇地，随播种，使一万三千多亩小麦适时种上。全县立即推广永福庄的经验，掀起了大挖土井、抗旱种麦的活动。很快就挖成土井两万七千多眼，修好旧井六千五百眼，挖渠道三百一十条，挖坑塘九十五个，各地还新打了一批机井。这样兴办小型农田水利，在几个月的时间里，任县就把占全县耕地百分之三十四以上的十六万多亩旱地变成了水浇地。结果，不仅夺得了今年小麦丰收，而且为今后持续高产打下了基础。
    去冬以来，中共任县县委高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，采取各种有效的办法，用毛泽东思想武装农民。各级党组织都把宣传毛泽东思想作为头等大事。凡是到农村工作的干部都把组织群众学习毛主席著作作为首要任务，带头学、带头用、带头传，辅导群众学习毛主席著作。全县形成了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。这个运动对取得抗旱斗争胜利和小麦丰收，起了决定性的作用。
    任县广大干部和社员，在总结今年小麦丰收的经验时，一致认为：千条万条，毛泽东思想挂帅是第一条。广大干部和社员更加热爱和信仰毛泽东思想。他们表示，要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想，彻底斗倒一切牛鬼蛇神，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设做出更大贡献。
