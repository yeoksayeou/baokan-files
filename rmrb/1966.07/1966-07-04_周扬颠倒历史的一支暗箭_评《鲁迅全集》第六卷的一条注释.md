    Zhou Yang's Reversal of History: An Arrow in the Dark
    — An Evaluation of a Note in Volume Six of the Complete Works of Lu Xun

    In the sixth volume of the *Complete Works of Lu Xun*, published in 1958, on page 614, there is a note on Lu Xun's *Reply to Xu Mo-yong and the Issue of the United Front Against Japanese Aggression*. This note was produced by Comrade Zhou Yang, Lin Mo-han, and Shao Yuan-lin. It openly contradicts Comrade Mao Zedong's summary of the literary movement of the 1930s, attacking the great banner of the left-wing literary movement, Lu Xun, and labeling a bourgeois, revisionist literary black line as the Marxist-Leninist literary line. It also labels the bourgeois surrenderist slogan of "National Defense Literature" as a proletarian slogan. Their purpose in producing this note is to openly raise the banner of the "1930s" literary black line, opposing the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong's literary line.

    To uncover the truth, we will reveal the process of producing this note.

    From July to September 1957, at the expanded meeting of the Chinese Writers' Association Party Group, the commander of the "1930s" literary black line, Zhou Yang, seized the opportunity to oppose the rightist element Feng Xue-feng to distort the history of the struggle between the two lines on the literary front. He released a batch of poisonous weeds. Zhou Yang and others brazenly attacked Lu Xun's proposal of "literature for the people during the national revolutionary war," a proletarian slogan, and his important articles such as *Reply to the Trotskyites*, *On the Current Literary Movement*, and *Reply to Xu Mo-yong and the Issue of the United Front Against Japanese Aggression*. But they were afraid to directly point the spearhead at Lu Xun, so they fabricated lies, saying that the slogan "literature for the people during the national revolutionary war" was proposed by "Feng Xue-feng and Hu Feng in collusion." They also said that these articles were written by Feng Xue-feng and were published when Lu Xun was seriously ill and could barely speak. At first glance, it seemed that the spearhead was directed at the rightist element Feng Xue-feng and the counter-revolutionary element Hu Feng, but in reality, it was a vicious attack on Lu Xun and a reversal of the proletarian revolutionary literary line represented by Lu Xun. They threw out the bourgeois "1930s" literary black line represented by Zhou Yang.

    After the meeting ended, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo-han, and Shao Yuan-lin frequently exchanged letters and visited each other, carefully crafting this note on *Reply to Xu Mo-yong and the Issue of the United Front Against Japanese Aggression* according to the tune set at the expanded meeting of the Chinese Writers' Association Party Group.

    On October 19, 1957, Wang Shi-qing, the person in charge of the *Complete Works of Lu Xun* editorial office, sent out the draft of the note on the sixth volume of *Complete Works of Lu Xun* in the name of the People's Literature Publishing House. In the accompanying letter, it was specially stated that the draft of the note on *Reply to Xu Mo-yong and the Issue of the United Front Against Japanese Aggression* was written according to the tune set at the expanded meeting of the Chinese Writers' Association Party Group.

    Zhou Yang and others were not satisfied with this draft. So, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo-han, and Shao Yuan-lin made revisions together.

    Everyone can see from the photo of the revised draft (see the attached image) that they deleted a large section and rewrote another section. The deleted section was likely because of two reasons: first, the attack on Lu Xun was too blatant, and it mentioned Zhou Yang's name, openly placing him in opposition to Lu Xun, which was not beneficial to Zhou Yang; second, it still affirmed that the article was written by Lu Xun, but it was "published after discussing with Feng Xue-feng."

    The rewritten section, in steel pen, is Lin Mo-han's handwriting, and in pencil, it is Zhou Yang's personal handwriting. This section was carefully crafted. Please see: First, it says that Xu Mo-yong's letter was a personal action and had nothing to do with Zhou Yang and others. This trick, though clever, also has its clumsiness. Uninformed readers would not originally think of the relationship between Xu Mo-yong's letter and Zhou Yang, but this note makes it "there is no silver here," instead drawing attention to it.

    Second, it says that Lu Xun's article was written by Feng Xue-feng. Lin Mo-han is a fool, and his lies are not convincing. He made it "Feng Xue-feng drafted." Zhou Yang is more cunning than Lin Mo-han, changing "drafted" to "drafted (Lu Xun) in the final draft." Although the lie is more rounded, the original intention of the lie is to say that Lu Xun's article was Feng Xue-feng's article, so that Zhou Yang can avoid the infamous attack on Lu Xun. This change, however, exposes his true intention of attacking Lu Xun.

    How contradictory the liars of history are!

    On November 15, 1957, Lin Mo-han sent out this note and at the same time wrote a letter to Wang Shi-qing: "The note on Lu Xun's reply to Xu Mo-yong has been discussed with Comrades Zhou Yang and Shao Yuan-lin and has been revised. Please reconsider it."

    The letter was sent out, and after sleeping one night, he felt something was wrong. The next day (November 16), Lin Mo-han hurriedly sent another letter to Wang Shi-qing: "Yesterday, I sent the revised draft of the note on Lu Xun's reply to Xu Mo-yong. I believe you have received it. The second sentence of the section we revised, '... the underground party organization in Shanghai did not know in advance,' is not quite accurate. Please change it to '... the organization of the Communist Party of China in the cultural circles of Shanghai, which was in an underground state at that time, did not know in advance.' Hurriedly."

    This way, however, raises another question. You are sometimes the "underground party organization in Shanghai," and sometimes the "organization of the Communist Party of China in the cultural circles of Shanghai, which was in an underground state." This cannot but raise questions: what kind of organization are you? What kind of "underground state" are you in?

    On December 2, 1957, Lin Mo-han wrote another letter to Wang Shi-qing, ordering the final draft. Now, we will reproduce this note that reverses history:

    "The Communist Party of China issued a declaration on August 1, 1935, proposing to the National Government, all parties, all factions, and all sectors of the people to stop the civil war and unite to resist Japan. By December of that year, it further decided on the policy of establishing a united front against Japanese aggression, which was supported by the people of the whole country and promoted the then anti-Japanese high tide. In the literary circles, propagating and forming a broad anti-Japanese national united front also became the most central issue at that time. At that time, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the revolutionary literary circles voluntarily dissolved the 'Left League' in the spring of 1936 and prepared to establish the 'Association of Writers.' On the issue of literary creation, there was a debate between the slogans of 'National Defense Literature' and 'Literature for the People During the National Revolutionary War.' Lu Xun expressed his attitude and opinions on the policy of the anti-Japanese national united front and the then literary movement in this article and in his *Reply to the Trotskyites* and *On the Current Literary Movement* published in June.

    Xu Mo-yong wrote that letter to Lu Xun completely out of his personal wrongdoing. The organization of the Communist Party of China in the cultural circles of Shanghai, which was in an underground state at that time, did not know in advance. Lu Xun was then ill, and his reply was drafted by Feng Xue-feng. In this article, he adopted a sectarian attitude towards some party member writers who were then leading the work of the 'Left League,' making some accusations that did not conform to the facts. Due to the then environmental factors, Lu Xun could not investigate and verify those facts in the final draft."

    Stripping away the obscure and convoluted language, it means:

    First, the so-called "organization of the Communist Party of China in the cultural circles of Shanghai" refers to the Zhou Yang group. Their literary line and the slogan of "National Defense Literature" they proposed are correct and conform to the Party's policy of the anti-Japanese national united front.

    Second, Lu Xun's attitude and opinions on the policy of the anti-Japanese national united front and the then literary movement, and the slogan of "Literature for the People During the National Revolutionary War" proposed by Lu Xun, are wrong and sectarian.

    Let us see how Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the struggle between the two classes and two lines on the cultural front in the 1930s, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership on the cultural front. How did Lu Xun deal with it? How did the Zhou Yang group reverse history, oppose Mao Zedong's thought, and attack the communist Lu Xun?

    From 1927 to 1937, Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the struggle on the cultural front in the *New Democracy* as follows:

    This period was a time of both revolutionary suppression and revolutionary deepening. There were two kinds of revolutionary suppression: military suppression and cultural suppression. There were also two kinds of revolutionary deepening: rural revolution deepening and cultural revolution deepening. These two kinds of suppression, under the instigation of imperialism, mobilized the counter-revolutionary forces of the whole country and the whole world, lasting for ten years, the most brutal in history, killing tens of thousands of Communist Party members and young students, and destroying hundreds of thousands of workers and peasants. From the perspective of the participants, it seemed that communism and the Communist Party could be "exterminated." But the result was the opposite. Both kinds of suppression were defeated. The result of the military suppression was the northward march of the Red Army to resist Japan; the result of the cultural suppression was the outbreak of the "December 9th" youth revolutionary movement in 1935. And the common result of these two kinds of suppression was the awakening of the people of the whole country. These three are active results. The strangest thing is that the Communist Party was in a position of no resistance in all cultural institutions in the Nationalist-controlled areas, why did the cultural suppression also fail miserably? This is still worth deep reflection. And the communist Lu Xun became a great man of the Chinese cultural revolution in this suppression. ①

    Comrade Mao Zedong's words clearly answered two questions in the history of the struggle on the cultural front:

    First, the summary of the struggle between the enemy and us on the cultural front: the complete failure of the counter-revolutionary cultural suppression; the deepening and development of the cultural revolution.

    Second, the summary of the struggle between the two lines within the revolutionary cultural front: the representative of the correct direction is the fighting left-wing literary movement led by Lu Xun. The communist Lu Xun became a great man of the Chinese cultural revolution in the counter-revolutionary cultural suppression.

    In this historical period, Zhou Yang and others implemented a line of opportunism opposed to Mao Zedong's thought. In the early period, it was the "left" opportunist line of Wang Ming. In the later period, it was the right opportunist line of Wang Ming. They are not true communists but bourgeois democrats. True communists are those attacked by them, Lu Xun. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Lu Xun is the most correct, bravest, most resolute, most loyal, and most enthusiastic national hero on the cultural front, representing the majority of the nation, charging and attacking the enemy. The direction of Lu Xun is the direction of the new culture of the Chinese nation." ② Obviously, the defeat of the counter-revolutionary cultural suppression and the deepening of the cultural revolution in this period are the victory of the direction of the "new culture of the Chinese nation" represented by Lu Xun, not the victory of the opportunist line represented by Zhou Yang. The opportunist line was a complete failure.

    Linked with the struggle between the two lines is the debate between the two slogans of "National Defense Literature" and "Literature for the People During the National Revolutionary War."

    The slogan of "National Defense Literature" was formulated by Zhou Yang according to Wang Ming's right opportunist line. Its characteristic is to cancel class struggle, abandon the leadership of the proletariat, rely on the landlord bourgeoisie, and not the laboring people. This is the "class surrenderism" criticized by Comrade Mao Zedong. This slogan is completely contrary to Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of the anti-Japanese national united front and is a thorough bourgeois slogan.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said in *New Democracy*: "Because the current Chinese revolution cannot be separated from the leadership of the Chinese proletariat, the current new culture of China also cannot be separated from the leadership of the cultural thought of the Chinese proletariat, that is, it cannot be separated from the leadership of communist thought." ③

    The slogan of "National Defense Literature" is precisely to cancel the leadership of the Communist Party of China, cancel the leadership of proletarian cultural thought, and cancel the leadership of communist thought. The implementation of this slogan will inevitably make Zhou Yang's so-called national defense literature become a subordinate of the literature of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie who surrender to imperialism.

    At that time, the play *Sai Jin Hua* by Xia Yan, who was praised by Zhou Yang as having written the "most central theme" and "opened a new field for national defense drama," was a typical example of "National Defense Literature." ④ The great communist Lu Xun made a serious critique of this typical work. Lu Xun wrote: "Writing has already had the 'most central theme': even Sai Jin Hua, who slept with the German commander Waldersee during the Boxer Rebellion, has long been sealed as the Nine Heavenly Guardian Mother." ⑤ Lu Xun is completely correct. Zhou Yang's "most central theme" is precisely the theme of surrender. Zhou Yang's "National Defense Literature" is precisely surrender literature. On this issue, Comrade Mu Xin's article *Critique of the Reactionary Thought in the Play Sai Jin Hua* ⑥ has made a profound analysis and critique.

    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "In the anti-Japanese national revolutionary war, class surrenderism is actually the reserve army of national surrenderism, the most vicious tendency to aid the right-wing camp and cause the war to fail." ⑦ The practice of "National Defense Literature" in the late 1930s completely proves Comrade Mao Zedong's wise judgment.

    Opposing the bourgeois slogan of "National Defense Literature" is the slogan of "Literature for the People During the National Revolutionary War" proposed by Lu Xun. Lu Xun correctly emphasized the leadership responsibility of proletarian cultural thought in the cultural united front. He pointed out, "It is not that revolutionary literature wants to abandon its leadership responsibility, but rather that it makes its responsibility heavier and larger," ⑧ and believed that within the national united front, criticism should also be made of bourgeois literature. In this period, many of Lu Xun's articles and letters were written using the sharp weapon of class analysis of the proletariat, criticizing the errors caused by the slogan of "National Defense Literature" while fighting against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and deeply criticizing the dangerous tendency of advocating class reconciliation under the name of the united front. The greatness of Lu Xun lies in the fact that after becoming a communist, he never forgot class and class struggle.

    Summarizing the history of the left-wing literary movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the 1930s with Mao Zedong's thought, it is:

    One proletarian literary line, represented by Lu Xun.

    One bourgeois literary line, represented by Zhou Yang.

    One proletarian slogan: Literature for the People During the National Revolutionary War.

    One bourgeois slogan: National Defense Literature.

    The note on *Reply to Xu Mo-yong and the Issue of the United Front Against Japanese Aggression* opposes Comrade Mao Zedong's historical summary, labeling the wrong line as the correct line, the correct line as the wrong line, the bourgeois slogan as the proletarian slogan, and the proletarian slogan as the bourgeois slogan.

    It is worth noting that when Zhou Yang and others played this trick of reversing history to deceive people, they used the method of stealing heaven and changing days. On the one hand, they attacked Lu Xun's *Reply to Xu Mo-yong and the Issue of the United Front Against Japanese Aggression* as "sectarianism," and on the other hand, they put on a hypocritical face, saying that this article was drafted by Feng Xue-feng, and Lu Xun was then ill and could not investigate and verify.

    This is nonsense! This is a slander against Lu Xun! Is Lu Xun really so confused because of his illness?! Can he not resist when others impose sectarian views on him?! Zhou Yang and others also underestimated the discernment of the masses! As long as one has read Lu Xun's articles and letters, one can see that although Lu Xun was then ill, his struggle against class surrenderism and national surrenderism was relentless. Lu Xun, from the standpoint of a communist, understood and implemented the Party's policy of the anti-Japanese national united front, and therefore, he could use a sharp eye to see through some opportunists who shouted the slogan of the united front but actually practiced class surrender, and he made a profound exposure and sharp criticism of them. The article *Reply to Xu Mo-yong and the Issue of the United Front Against Japanese Aggression* and Lu Xun's other articles in this period are completely Lu Xun's thoughts. Lu Xun clearly wrote in his diary on August 5, 1936: "Night finished editing the reply to Xu Mo-yong." ⑨ To say that such an important article of Lu Xun is actually Feng Xue-feng's is pure fabrication. This is a very vicious and treacherous method used to overthrow Lu Xun.

    To achieve the purpose of deceiving readers, Zhou Yang and others set up another trap.

    After Lu Xun's *Reply to Xu Mo-yong and the Issue of the United Front Against Japanese Aggression* was published, he mentioned this article he wrote in letters to his friends. These important letters were actually removed from the *Complete Works of Lu Xun* by these cowardly old gentlemen. To expose this trap, we will cite the following letters.

    One letter is dated August 28, 1936. The letter says:

    "Because I did not join the association, the immortals laid out a siege, and Xu Mo-yong, knowing that I was about to die not long ago, bravely attacked me first."

    "In fact, although the letter was written by him alone, it represented a certain group. If you read it carefully, you can see the tone, and it will be clear. Therefore, I think it is more necessary to reply publicly. If it is just a matter between us, unrelated to the big picture, then why bother to chatter in the magazine? The gentleman thinks this matter 'wastes energy,' which is not entirely true. A light shines, making the faces of the demons hiding under the big banner appear, and see the recent Shanghai small newspapers and the like, this effect is already very clear, they will eventually reveal their true faces in front of everyone."

    Another letter is dated September 15, 1936. The letter says:

    "Shanghai is not only bad weather, but also bad literary atmosphere. In my article (referring to *Reply to Xu Mo-yong and the Issue of the United Front Against Japanese Aggression*), the examples given are only a small part. Here, there is a kind of literati, actually the so-called green skin in Tianjin, who specialize in spreading rumors, intimidating, and using tricks to set up nets to attract literary young people who do not know the bottom, to create positions for themselves; as for works, there are none. They are really good at making noise. Like Xu Mo-yong, he is so arrogant that he forgets himself and uses 'practical solution' to threaten me, then for other young people, it can be imagined. They have a group, colluding with each other, controlling the literary circles, making them smoky and poisonous. I plan to expose them when my illness is slightly better, then the future of Chinese literature will be saved. Now they are using 'small newspapers' to harm me, which shows their lack of ability."

    Another letter is dated October 15, 1936, the night before Lu Xun's death. The letter says:

    "I, seeing through the world, originally planned to do less meddling, focusing on translation to make a living, so this year I wrote very few articles, followed by a serious illness, lying in bed for several months, and the small clowns who had hidden away for fear of trouble took advantage of the tide, appearing one after another, taking advantage of my danger, launching a fierce attack, so I leaned on the pillow, giving them a few whips, these guys are despicable, but they are harmful to people's hearts, brother has not seen the literary atmosphere in Shanghai, in the past few years, it has lost the spirit of humanity."

    In these letters, Lu Xun stated that he wrote *Reply to Xu Mo-yong and the Issue of the United Front Against Japanese Aggression* not as a matter between individuals unrelated to the big picture, but as a matter of great right and wrong related to the future of Chinese literature, a sharp struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership in the cultural field. From these letters, it can be seen that Lu Xun, for the sake of the proletariat, for the sake of the people, how much he hated Zhou Yang and these people! Lu Xun, even when he was critically ill, loudly declared: "If my illness is slightly better, I will still expose them!" Undoubtedly, if Lu Xun had lived, he would have fought to the end with the bourgeois surrenderist literary line represented by Zhou Yang.

    These letters of Lu Xun and other important letters criticizing the slogan of "National Defense Literature" and the sectarianism and exclusivism of Zhou Yang and others were originally collected in *Letters of Lu Xun* edited by Comrade Xu Guangping. The new edition of *Complete Works of Lu Xun*, in the *Publisher's Note* of the first volume published in October 1956, still said: "This edition includes all the letters that have been collected so far." However, by October 1958, when the ninth volume of the *Letters* part was published, the *Note* was changed to: "The *Letters* we are printing this time are selected from the 855 letters collected in the 1946 printed edition and the 310 letters that have been continuously collected so far, that is, only the more meaningful ones are selected, and general correspondence is not included, totaling 334 letters." What a "selection of the more meaningful ones"! What a "general correspondence is not included"! Are these letters meaningless? Are they "general correspondence"? Let everyone evaluate it! Also, let Zhou Yang and others answer: Why did you not include these letters? Isn't it because you are afraid of exposing the true faces of your group of "demons" and "clowns"?

    Zhou Yang and others worked so hard to hide the truth and reverse history, aiming to reverse the history of the literary movement in the 1930s to seize the leadership of the literary circles today.

    These people, Zhou Yang and others, were called "leftists" during the democratic revolution but were actually rightists. Since the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party in 1938, Comrade Mao Zedong has criticized them many times. However, Zhou Yang and others, while pretending to accept Comrade Mao Zedong's criticism on the surface, harbored resentment in their hearts. They used two-faced tactics, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, deceiving the Party and the people. After the Chinese revolution entered the socialist stage, their anti-Party and anti-Mao Zedong thought criminal activities not only did not stop but became even more rampant. They opposed Mao Zedong's literary thought and the multiple major struggles on the literary front personally led by Comrade Mao Zedong, openly or secretly, adopting various conspiratorial means to resist and sabotage.

    During the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, they concealed their rightist political face, using the leadership position they had usurped in the literary circles to wave the banner of opposing the rightist element Feng Xue-feng, attempting to strike down Lu Xun with one blow and elevate Zhou Yang, the big rightist, to the throne of the "ancestor" of the literary circles.

    At the same time as releasing the note that reverses history, Zhou Yang also published an article titled *A Great Debate on the Literary Front*. This article, under the guise of summarizing the experience of the anti-rightist struggle in the literary circles, buried many nails inside. The most vicious nail is to overturn the case of the struggle between the two lines on the literary front in the 1930s. He used the criticism of the rightist element Feng Xue-feng as a pretext to slander the Party and Chairman Mao's criticism of the literary black line in the 1930s.

    Immediately, a group of leading figures in the literary circles held a "discussion meeting" to discuss Zhou Yang's article, praising Zhou Yang highly. This is a "discussion meeting" that opposes Comrade Mao Zedong's *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*. On March 26, 1958, the sixth issue of *Literature and Art* published a speech titled *Clearing the Way for the Great Leap Forward in Literature and Art* from the "discussion meeting."

    The speeches of Lin Mo-han, Shao Yuan-lin, Yuan Shu-pai, and others unanimously proposed to take Zhou Yang's article as the "foundation" to re-summarize the struggle between the two lines on the literary front. Lin Mo-han said that this article "not only summarized the experience and results of the heart-stirring anti-rightist struggle in the literary circles last year but also analyzed the historical and class roots of this struggle, providing a basis for clarification and summary of the long-term disputes and debates in the left-wing literary movement in our country."  Shao Yuan-lin said: "Clearing the veins, digging out the roots, finding the laws, it can be said that this article is an initial summary of the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines in the proletarian literary movement in our country for more than thirty years." ②

    Comrade Mao Zedong's *New Democracy* and *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art* have already made the most complete, comprehensive, and systematic historical summary of the struggle between the two lines on the cultural front. After the Chinese revolution entered the socialist stage, Comrade Mao Zedong also published *On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People* and *Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China*, which is the latest summary of the historical experience of the revolutionary thought movement and literary movement in our country and other countries. However, Lin Mo-han and others thought that Comrade Mao Zedong had not yet made a summary for us, or even had not provided a "basis for clarification and summary." They wanted to take Zhou Yang's article as the "foundation" to re-summarize the struggle between the two lines on the literary front, making a summary that opposes Mao Zedong's thought.

    Shao Yuan-lin also wanted people to rewrite modern literary history according to the direction proposed by Zhou Yang. ③ They wanted to seal the bourgeois literary line as orthodox and overthrow the proletarian literary line.

    Yuan Shu-pai and others' speeches directly pointed the spearhead at Comrade Mao Zedong's *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*. They used the excuse of the so-called change of the times to use the "new things" in Zhou Yang's article to "annotate" and "elaborate" Comrade Mao Zedong's *Talks*, "making Marxist literary theory more abundant." ④

    After reading these ghostly words of the "authorities" in the literary circles, Zhou Yang's great conspiracy was exposed to us. They wanted to use "annotation," "elaboration," "making more abundant," and other methods to oppose Mao Zedong's thought and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism. They wanted to use a black line of bourgeois literary thought, modern revisionist literary thought, and the so-called literary thought of the 1930s combined to oppose the proletarian literary line and establish the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie over the proletarian literary line.

    A note in the *Complete Works of Lu Xun*, an article by Zhou Yang, and a discussion meeting praising Zhou Yang are purposeful and planned to attack the Party and Mao Zedong's thought. They put forward a revisionist literary program opposing Mao Zedong's literary line, further elevating Zhou Yang's hegemony in the literary circles.

    After that, Zhou Yang became arrogant and did as he pleased, giving speeches, writing articles, issuing instructions, organizing, spreading poison, and recruiting traitors all over the country. He openly raised a big black flag against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong's thought, more fiercely opposing Comrade Mao Zedong's literary line.

    In politics, Zhou Yang is the "leader" of the anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong thought literary black line. He opposes the class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, opposes the literature serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and advocates the so-called "literature for all the people." This "literature for all the people" is the reactionary literature of capitalism, feudalism, and revisionism. He viciously attacks the so-called "class labelism." He says: "Labelism is to stick a class label on everything, saying this is bourgeois, that is proletarian, as if people are the incarnation of class, only class nature.... Where is there so much class nature!" He says: "The relationship between resonance and class nature is not great, the art of any class is not just for its own class to see, it is for all classes to see, to resonate with all people, as to whether it resonates or not, that is another matter." He says: "Art works are acceptable to any class, works produced by a class cannot only be enjoyed by that class, otherwise that work is a failure. Some works, however, reflect the interests of a class and the interests of all the people." ⑤

    This is a thorough bourgeois, revisionist literary theory. In the 1930s, Zhou Yang proposed "National Defense Literature" and "literature of the whole Chinese nation" that did not distinguish classes. Now, he has picked up the remnants of Khrushchev's "party of the whole people" and "state of the whole people," forming a more comprehensive and systematic anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong thought literary black line in the new situation, and is trying to promote it nationwide. In the more than ten years since the founding of the country, a large number of reactionary fallacies that have flooded the literary circles, such as the "write reality" theory, the anti-"theme determines" theory, the "middle character" theory, etc., all come from Zhou Yang's literary black line. The former Ministry of Culture refused to implement Chairman Mao's literary line, becoming a department of emperors, kings, and generals, concubines and beauties, specializing in spreading the reactionary literature of capitalism, feudalism, and revisionism, becoming a tool for the bourgeoisie to establish dictatorship over the proletariat, which is inseparable from the rule of Zhou Yang's literary black line. Many associations under the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles have become organizations like the Petofi Club of Hungary, which is the result of implementing Zhou Yang's literary black line. A large number of bad works, bad films, bad plays, bad music... that have been released are the result of Zhou Yang's literary black line. All of these are preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

    In terms of organization, Zhou Yang is the "leader" of the anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong thought literary black gang. He stubbornly adheres to the bourgeois sectarian organizational line he has been implementing since the "1930s," using his long-term control of the leadership position in the literary circles to place some of his sectarian followers in many literary organizations at the central and national levels. He has a small circle, which is the group of bourgeois literary "elders" who followed the wrong line with him in the 1930s, and the disciples shaped by his bourgeois, revisionist literary thought. He also harbors and praises a group of feudal remnants, traitors, spies, and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities," forming a literary black gang that opposes the Party, opposes socialism, and opposes Mao Zedong's thought.

    Under the rule of Zhou Yang's literary black line, at the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s, especially when our country encountered natural disasters and the sabotage of the Khrushchev revisionist clique, a great black wind swept through the literary circles nationwide. This is the revival and development of the opportunist literary line of the 1930s. This revival and development, in response to the domestic and foreign reactionaries, has a more pronounced anti-Party, anti-socialist, and counter-revolutionary political character! Its tentacles are wide, and its poison is deep, involving universities, the performing arts, the film industry, the literary circles, the music industry, the news and publishing industry, etc. This is a reactionary political countercurrent that is organized, planned, and coordinated.

    The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao has lifted the lid on the class struggle in the ideological realm and the lid on the rule of the black line in the literary circles, exposing the true colors of Zhou Yang and others. We must carry out this great struggle to defend the Party, defend socialism, and defend Mao Zedong's thought to the end, and completely overthrow the anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong thought literary black line and literary black gang led by Zhou Yang! Under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary thought, we will definitely build a new proletarian, socialist culture!

    周扬颠倒历史的一支暗箭
    ——评《鲁迅全集》第六卷的一条注释
    阮铭　阮若瑛
    一九五八年出版的《鲁迅全集》第六卷第六一四页上，有一条对鲁迅所作《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》的注释。这条注释，是周扬同志和林默涵、邵荃麟一些人制作的。它公然同毛泽东同志对三十年代文艺运动的历史总结唱反调，攻击左翼文艺运动的伟大旗手鲁迅，把一条资产阶级、修正主义的文艺黑线说成是马克思列宁主义的文艺路线，把一个资产阶级投降主义的“国防文学”口号说成是无产阶级的口号。他们制作这条注释的目的，是为了公开打出“三十年代”文艺黑线的旗号，反对党和毛泽东同志的文艺路线。
    为了弄明真相，我们把这一条注释的制作过程公之于众。
    一九五七年七月到九月，在中国作家协会党组扩大会议上，“三十年代”文艺黑线的主帅周扬，借反对右派分子冯雪峰的机会，颠倒文艺战线上两条路线斗争的历史，放出了一批毒草。周扬等人放肆地攻击鲁迅提出的“民族革命战争的大众文学”这一无产阶级口号，攻击鲁迅的《答托洛斯基派的信》、《论现在我们的文学运动》、《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》等重要文章。但他们作贼心虚，不敢直接把矛头指向鲁迅，就造谣说，“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个口号是“冯雪峰、胡风共谋”提出的；这几篇文章是冯雪峰写的，“是在鲁迅病重甚至连话都说不出来的情况下通过发出的”。乍看起来，似乎矛头指向右派分子冯雪峰、反革命分子胡风，实际上是恶毒地攻击鲁迅，大反鲁迅所代表的无产阶级的革命文艺路线，抛出了周扬所代表的资产阶级的“三十年代”文艺黑线。
    会议结束以后，周扬、林默涵、邵荃麟等人，往来不绝，书信不断，费尽心机地按照他们在中国作家协会党组扩大会议上定下的调子，制作了这一条《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》的注释。
    一九五七年十月十九日，《鲁迅全集》编辑室的负责人王士菁，以人民文学出版社的名义，向一些人发出《鲁迅全集》第六卷的注释稿。在附信中特别申明：《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》的注释稿，是遵照中国作家协会党组扩大会议定下的调子写的。
    对这个注释稿，周扬等人还不满意。于是由周扬、林默涵、邵荃麟三人在一起作了修改。
    大家从修改稿的照片（见附图）可以看到，他们删去了一大段，又改写了一段。删去那一段，看来是因为两个原因：一是对鲁迅的攻击太露骨，而且抬出周扬的名字，公开把他放在鲁迅对立面的地位，这样对周扬不利；二是仍肯定文章是鲁迅写的，只是“同冯雪峰商量过以后发表的”。
    改写的一段，钢笔字是林默涵的笔迹，铅笔字是周扬亲笔。这一段妙文，确是煞费苦心制作出来的。请看：第一是说，徐懋庸的信，是个人行动，与周扬等人无关。此计虽妙，但也有笨拙之处。不明真相的读者，原来不会想到徐懋庸的信和周扬的关系，这么一注，倒是“此地无银三百两”，反而引人注目了。
    第二是说，鲁迅的这篇文章，是冯雪峰写的。林默涵是个蠢才，撒谎也撒不象，他搞了个冯雪峰“执笔代写”。周扬比林默涵狡猾，把“代写”改成“拟稿”，还添了（鲁迅）“在定稿时”四个字。虽然谎是撒得圆些，但撒谎的原意，是要把鲁迅这篇文章说成是冯雪峰的文章，使周扬免于攻击鲁迅的恶名。这样一改，却又露出了他攻击鲁迅的真情实意。
    历史的撒谎者，是何等自相矛盾啊！
    一九五七年十一月十五日，林默涵把这条注释送出，同时给王士菁写了一封信：“鲁迅答徐懋庸文的注释，经与周扬、荃麟同志商量，作了一些删改，请再斟酌。”
    信既发出，睡了一夜，感到不妙。第二天（十一月十六日）林默涵又给王士菁“匆匆”发出一信：“昨天寄上鲁迅答徐懋庸文注释修正稿，谅已收到。我们修改的那一段第二句话‘……事前上海的地下党组织并不知道。’不大确切，请改为‘……当时处于地下状态的中国共产党在上海文化界的组织，事前并不知道。’匆匆。”
    这么一来，却又提出了一个问题。你们忽而是“上海的地下党组织”，忽而又变成“处于地下状态的中国共产党在上海文化界的组织”，这不能不引起人们的疑问：你们到底算是什么组织呢？是处于怎样的“地下状态”呢？
    一九五七年十二月二日，林默涵又给王士菁写了一封信，下令定稿。现在把这条颠倒历史的注释照录于下：
    “中国共产党于一九三五年八月一日发表宣言，向国民党政府、全国各党各派和各界人民提出了停止内战、一致抗日的主张，到该年十二月更进一步决定了建立抗日民族统一战线的政策，得到全国人民的拥护，促进了当时的抗日高潮。在文艺界，宣传和结成广泛的抗日民族统一战线，也成为那时最中心的问题；当时在中国共产党领导下的革命文学界，于一九三六年春间即自动解散‘左联’，筹备成立‘文艺家协会’，对于文学创作问题则有关于‘国防文学’和‘民族革命战争的大众文学’两个口号的论争。鲁迅在本文以及他在六月间发表的《答托洛斯基派的信》和《论现在我们的文学运动》中，表示了他对于抗日民族统一战线政策和当时文学运动的态度和意见。
    徐懋庸给鲁迅写那封信，完全是他个人的错误行动，当时处于地下状态的中国共产党在上海文化界的组织事前并不知道。鲁迅当时在病中，他的答复是冯雪峰执笔拟稿的，他在这篇文章中对于当时领导‘左联’工作的一些党员作家采取了宗派主义的态度，做了一些不符合事实的指责。由于当时环境关系，鲁迅在定稿时不可能对那些事实进行调查和对证。”
    剥开那套隐晦曲折的笔法，说得明白一点，它的意思就是：
    第一，所谓“中国共产党在上海文化界的组织”即周扬一伙，他们的文艺路线，他们所提出的“国防文学”口号，是正确的，符合党的抗日民族统一战线政策的。
    第二，鲁迅对于抗日民族统一战线政策和当时文学运动的态度和意见，鲁迅所提出的“民族革命战争的大众文学”的口号，是错误的，宗派主义的。
    让我们看一看，对三十年代文化战线上两个阶级、两条路线的斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级在文化战线上争夺领导权的斗争，毛泽东同志是怎样总结的？鲁迅是怎样对待的？周扬一伙搞的颠倒历史的注释，又是怎样反对毛泽东思想、攻击共产主义者鲁迅的？
    一九二七年至一九三七年文化战线上的斗争，毛泽东同志在《新民主主义论》中是这样总结的：
    这一时期，是一方面反革命的“围剿”，又一方面革命深入的时期。这时有两种反革命的“围剿”：军事“围剿”和文化“围剿”。也有两种革命深入：农村革命深入和文化革命深入。这两种“围剿”，在帝国主义策动之下，曾经动员了全中国和全世界的反革命力量，其时间延长至十年之久，其残酷是举世未有的，杀戮了几十万共产党员和青年学生，摧残了几百万工农人民。从当事者看来，似乎以为共产主义和共产党是一定可以“剿尽杀绝”的了。但结果却相反，两种“围剿”都惨败了。作为军事“围剿”的结果的东西，是红军的北上抗日；作为文化“围剿”的结果的东西，是一九三五年“一二九”青年革命运动的爆发。而作为这两种“围剿”之共同结果的东西，则是全国人民的觉悟。这三者都是积极的结果。其中最奇怪的，是共产党在国民党统治区域内的一切文化机关中处于毫无抵抗力的地位，为什么文化“围剿”也一败涂地了？这还不可以深长思之么？而共产主义者的鲁迅，却正在这一“围剿”中成了中国文化革命的伟人。①
    毛泽东同志的这段话，明确地回答了这一时期文化战线斗争史上的两个问题：
    第一，对文化战线上敌我斗争的总结：反革命文化“围剿”的一败涂地；文化革命的深入和发展。
    第二，对革命文化战线内部两条路线斗争的总结：代表正确方向的，是以鲁迅为首的战斗的左翼文艺运动。共产主义者的鲁迅，在反革命的文化“围剿”中成了中国文化革命的伟人。
    在这个历史时期，周扬等人执行了一条与毛泽东思想相对抗的机会主义路线。在前期，是王明的“左”倾机会主义路线。在后期，是王明的右倾投降主义路线。他们不是真正的共产主义者，而是资产阶级民主主义者。真正的共产主义者，是受到他们攻击的鲁迅。正如毛泽东同志指出的：“鲁迅是在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄。鲁迅的方向，就是中华民族新文化的方向。”②显然，这个时期反革命文化“围剿”的惨败和文化革命的深入，是鲁迅所代表的“中华民族新文化的方向”的胜利，决不是周扬所代表的机会主义路线的胜利。机会主义路线是彻底失败了。
    与两条路线斗争联系着的，有“国防文学”和“民族革命战争的大众文学”这两个口号的争论。
    “国防文学”这个口号，是周扬根据王明的右倾机会主义路线制定的。其特点是取消阶级斗争，放弃无产阶级的领导地位，依靠地主资产阶级，不要劳动人民。这就是毛泽东同志批判过的“阶级对阶级的投降主义”。这个口号是完全违背毛泽东同志的抗日民族统一战线思想的，是彻头彻尾的资产阶级口号。
    毛泽东同志在《新民主主义论》中说：“由于现时中国革命不能离开中国无产阶级的领导，因而现时的中国新文化也不能离开中国无产阶级文化思想的领导，即不能离开共产主义思想的领导。”③  
      “国防文学”这个口号，正是要取消中国共产党的领导，取消无产阶级文化思想的领导，取消共产主义思想的领导。实行这一口号的结果，必然使周扬们的所谓国防文学，成为投降帝国主义的大地主大资产阶级文学的附庸。
    当时被周扬吹捧为写了“最中心的主题”、“给国防剧作开辟了一个新的园地”的夏衍的《赛金花》，就是“国防文学”的一个标本。④伟大的共产主义者鲁迅，对这个标本作了严正的批判。鲁迅写道：“作文已经有了‘最中心之主题’：连义和拳时代和德国统帅瓦德西睡了一些时候的赛金花，也早已封为九天护国娘娘了。”⑤鲁迅是完全正确的。周扬们的“最中心的主题”，正是投降的主题。周扬们的“国防文学”，正是投降文学。关于这个问题，穆欣同志的《评〈赛金花〉剧本的反动思想》一文⑥，已作了深刻的分析和批判。
    毛泽东同志指出：“在抗日民族革命战争中，阶级投降主义实际上是民族投降主义的后备军，是援助右翼营垒而使战争失败的最恶劣的倾向。”⑦三十年代后期的“国防文学”的实践，完全证明了毛泽东同志的这个英明论断。
    与“国防文学”这个资产阶级口号相对立的，是鲁迅提出的“民族革命战争的大众文学”的口号。鲁迅正确地强调了文化统一战线中无产阶级文化思想的领导责任。他指出，“决非革命文学要放弃它的阶级的领导的责任，而是将它的责任更加重，更放大”，⑧并且认为，在民族统一战线内部，对资产阶级文学也应当进行批判。鲁迅在这个时期所写的许多文章和书信，就是运用了无产阶级的阶级分析这一锐利的武器，在与帝国主义和国民党反动派搏斗的同时，批判了“国防文学”这个资产阶级口号所造成的错误，特别是深刻地批判了以统一战线为名，取消阶级斗争、主张阶级调和的危险倾向。鲁迅的伟大，就在于他成为一个共产主义者之后，从来没有忘记阶级和阶级斗争。
    用毛泽东思想来总结三十年代国民党统治区左翼文艺运动的历史，这就是：
    一条无产阶级的文艺路线，是以鲁迅为代表的。
    一条资产阶级的文艺路线，是以周扬为代表的。
    一个无产阶级的口号：民族革命战争的大众文学。
    一个资产阶级的口号：国防文学。
    《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》的注释，同毛泽东同志的历史总结相对抗，把错误路线说成正确路线，把正确路线说成错误路线，把资产阶级口号说成无产阶级口号，把无产阶级口号说成资产阶级口号。
    值得注意的是，周扬们在玩弄这一手颠倒历史的把戏的时候，为了掩人耳目，用了偷天换日的手法。他们一面攻击鲁迅的《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》是“宗派主义”，一面装出伪善的面孔，说这篇文章是冯雪峰执笔拟稿的，鲁迅当时在病中，不可能调查对证云云。
    这是胡说！这是对鲁迅的诬蔑！难道鲁迅真是病得这样糊涂了吗？！别人把“宗派主义”的观点强加于他也无能为力了吗？！周扬们对群众的识别力也估计得太低了！只要读过鲁迅的文章和书信，就可以看到，鲁迅当时虽在病中，但他反对阶级投降主义和民族投降主义的战斗，是毫不放松的。鲁迅是从一个共产主义者的立场来认识和实行党的抗日民族统一战线政策的，因此，能够以锐利的眼光来识破某些高喊统一战线口号而实际上实行阶级投降的机会主义者，并且对他们进行了深刻的揭露和尖锐的批判。《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》一文，和鲁迅这个时期的其他文章一样，完全是鲁迅的思想。鲁迅在一九三六年八月五日的日记中，也明明写着：“夜治答徐懋庸文讫。”⑨把鲁迅的这样一篇重要文章硬说成是冯雪峰的，这纯粹是造谣。这是为了打倒鲁迅而采用的一种极其恶毒、极其阴险的手法。
    周扬等人为了达到欺骗读者的目的，还设下了另外一个骗局。
    鲁迅《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》发表以后，在他给友人的信中，一再提到过他写的这篇文章。这些重要的书信，竟被这班作贼心虚的老爷们从《鲁迅全集》中抽掉了。为了揭穿这个骗局，我们引证以下的几封信。
    一封是一九三六年八月二十八日的信。信中说：
    “……正因为不入协会，群仙就大布围剿阵，徐懋庸也明知我不久之前，病得要死，却雄赳赳首先打上门来也。”
    “其实，写这信的虽是他一个，却代表着某一群，试一细读，看那口气，即可了然。因此我以为更有公开答复之必要。倘只我们彼此个人间事，无关大局，则何必在刊物上喋喋哉。先生虑此事‘徒费精力’，实不尽然，投一光辉，可使伏在大纛荫下的群魔嘴脸毕现，试看近日上海小报之类，此种效验，已极昭然，他们到底将在大家的眼前露出本相。”⑩
    又一封是一九三六年九月十五日的信。信中说：
    “上海不但天气不佳，文气也不象样。我的那篇文章（按：指《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》）中，所举的还不过很少的一点。这里的有一种文学家，其实就是天津之所谓青皮，他们就专用造谣，恫吓，播弄手段张网，以罗致不知底细的文学青年，给自己造地位；作品呢，却并没有。真是唯以嗡嗡营营为能事。如徐懋庸，他横暴到忘其所以，竟用‘实际解决’来恐吓我了，则对于别的青年，可想而知。他们自有一伙，狼狈为奸，把持着文学界，弄得乌烟瘴气。我病倘稍愈，还要给以暴露的，那么，中国文艺的前途庶几有救。现在他们在利用‘小报’给我损害，可见其没出息。”?
    又一封是一九三六年十月十五日夜，即鲁迅逝世前四天写的信。信中说：
    “……我鉴于世故，本拟少管闲事，专事翻译，借以糊口，故本年作文殊不多，继婴大病，稿卧数月，而以前以畏祸隐去之小丑，竟乘风潮，相率出现，乘我危难，大肆攻击，于是倚枕，稍稍报以数鞭，此辈虽猥劣，然实于人心有害，兄殆未见上海文风，近数年来，竟不复尚有人气也。”?  
    鲁迅在这些信中表明，他写《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》，决不是“无关大局”的“彼此个人间事”，而是关系到“中国文艺的前途”的大是大非问题，是无产阶级同资产阶级在文化战线上争夺领导权的尖锐斗争。从这些书信中可以看出，鲁迅为了无产阶级的利益，为了人民大众的利益，对周扬这些人多么深恶痛绝！鲁迅病危时，还响亮地宣告：“我病倘稍愈，还要给以暴露的”！毫无疑问，倘若鲁迅活下去，他一定要同以周扬为代表的这一条资产阶级投降主义的文艺路线斗争到底。
    鲁迅的这几封信以及批评“国防文学”口号和周扬等人的关门主义、宗派主义的其他重要书信，原来收集在许广平同志编的《鲁迅书简》中。新版的《鲁迅全集》，于一九五六年十月出版的第一卷《出版说明》中还说：“本版新收入现在已经搜集到的全部书信。”到了一九五八年十月，第九卷《书信》部分出版时，《说明》中却改成了，“我们这次印行的《书信》，系将一九四六年排印本所收八五五封和到现在为止继续征集到的三一○封，加以挑选，即择取较有意义的，一般来往信件都不编入，计共收三三四封。”好一个“择取较有意义的”！好一个“一般来往信件都不编入”！这些信难道是没有意义的吗？难道是“一般来往信件”吗？请大家来评一评吧！也请周扬们回答：你们为什么不让收入这些信件？难道不是怕暴露了你们这伙“群魔”、“小丑”的真面目吗？
    周扬们如此煞费苦心地掩藏事实真相，进行历史的颠倒，其目的是企图通过颠倒三十年代文艺运动的历史，争夺今天的文艺界的领导权。
    周扬这些人，在民主革命时期号称“左翼”，实际上是右翼。一九三八年党的六届六中全会以来，毛泽东同志对他们进行过多次的批判。但是周扬们对于毛泽东同志的批判，表面上佯作接受，实际上怀恨在心。他们采取两面派的手段，打着红旗反红旗，欺骗党，欺骗人民。我国革命进入社会主义阶段以后，他们的反党反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动，不但没有停止，反而更加猖狂起来。他们对毛泽东文艺思想，对毛泽东同志亲自领导的文艺战线上的多次重大斗争，阳奉阴违，采取各种阴谋手段，进行对抗和破坏。
    一九五七年反右派斗争中，他们把自己的右派政治面目掩盖起来，利用他们窃取的在文艺界的领导地位，打着反对右派分子冯雪峰的幌子，企图一棍子打倒鲁迅，把周扬这个大右派抬到文艺界“祖师爷”的宝座之上。
    与抛出颠倒历史的注释的同时，周扬还发表了一篇《文艺战线上的一场大辩论》的文章。这篇文章，打着总结文艺界反右派斗争经验的幌子，在里面埋下了不少钉子。最恶毒的一颗钉子，就是要翻三十年代文艺战线上两条路线斗争的案。他以批判右派分子冯雪峰为名，借题发挥，指桑骂槐地诬蔑党和毛主席对三十年代文艺黑线的批判。
    紧接着，文艺界的一批头面人物举行“座谈会”，座谈周扬的文章，对周扬大吹大捧。这是一个同毛泽东同志的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》唱反调的“座谈会”。一九五八年三月二十六日，第六期《文艺报》发表了题为《为文学艺术大跃进扫清道路》的“座谈会”发言。
    林默涵、邵荃麟、袁水拍等人的发言，一致提出要以周扬的这篇文章作为“基础”，重新总结文艺战线上两条路线的斗争。林默涵说，这篇文章“不但总结了去年文艺界那场震动心弦的反右派斗争的经过和结果，并且分析了这场斗争的历史的和阶级的根源，对长期以来我国左翼文艺运动中的分歧和争论，也提供了一个澄清和总结的基础。”?邵荃麟说：“理清脉络，挖出根子，找到规律，可以说就是这篇文章对三十多年来我国无产阶级文学运动两条道路斗争的历史经验所得出的一个初步总结。”?
    毛泽东同志的《新民主主义论》和《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，早已对文化战线上的两条路线斗争作出了最完整、最全面、最系统的历史总结。在我国革命进入社会主义阶段以后，毛泽东同志又发表了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》两篇著作，这是我国和各国革命思想运动、文艺运动的历史经验的最新的总结。但是林默涵等人却认为毛泽东同志还没有给我们作出总结，甚至还没有提供“澄清和总结的基础”。他们要以周扬的文章作为重新总结的“基础”，对文艺战线上两条路线的斗争，作出与毛泽东思想相对抗的“总结”。
    邵荃麟还要人们按照周扬提出的方向来改写现代文学史。?他们篡改现代文学史，就是要把资产阶级的文艺路线封为正统，打倒无产阶级的文艺路线。
    袁水拍等人的发言，把矛头直接指向了毛泽东同志的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。他们借口所谓时代的改变，要以周扬文章中的“新的东西”来“注释”和“发挥”毛泽东同志的《讲话》，“使马克思主义文艺理论更加丰富起来”。?
    读完了这些文艺界“权威”的鬼话，周扬们的大阴谋就暴露在我们面前了。他们要用“注释”、“发挥”、“更加丰富起来”等等这些手法，来反对毛泽东思想，为资本主义复辟开辟道路。他们要以一条资产阶级文艺思想、现代修正主义文艺思想和所谓三十年代文艺相结合的反党反社会主义的黑线，来对无产阶级文艺实行专政。
    《鲁迅全集》的一条注释，周扬的一篇文章，吹捧周扬的一个座谈会，这是有目的、有计划的相互配合起来向党向毛泽东思想的猖狂进攻。他们抛出了一个反对毛泽东文艺路线的修正主义文艺纲领，进一步抬高了周扬在文艺界的霸权地位。
    在这以后，周扬得意忘形，为所欲为，在全国各地做报告，写文章，作指示，抓组织，到处放毒，招降纳叛，公开打出一面反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的大黑旗，更疯狂地同毛泽东同志的文艺路线相对抗。
    在政治上，周扬是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的文艺黑线的“首领”。他反对无产阶级对资产阶级的阶级斗争，反对为工农兵服务的文艺，大搞所谓“全民的文艺”。这种“全民”牌的文艺，就是资本主义、封建主义、修正主义的反动文艺。他恶毒地攻击所谓“阶级标签主义”。说什么：“标签主义是把什么都贴上一张阶级标签，说这是资产阶级的，那是无产阶级的，好象人就是阶级的化身，只有阶级性。……哪里有那么多的阶级性！”说什么：“共鸣与阶级性的关系不大，任何一个阶级的艺术绝不只是给本阶级看的，它是给所有的阶级看的，引起所有人的共鸣，至于它引不引得起来，那是另一回事。”说什么：“艺术作品是任何一个阶级都可以接受的，一个阶级产生的作品不能只供本阶级欣赏，否则这个作品是失败的。有的作品，则是既反映阶级利益，又反映全体人民的利益。”等等。
    这是彻头彻尾的资产阶级、修正主义文艺理论。在三十年代，周扬提出了不分阶级的“国防文学”和“全中国民族的文学”。现在，他又拾取了赫鲁晓夫的“全民党”、“全民国家”的唾余，在新的形势下，形成了更全面、更系统的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的文艺黑线，并且力图把它推销到全国。建国后的十几年来，泛滥于文艺界的一大堆反动谬论，如“写真实”论，反“题材决定”论，“中间人物”论，等等，都是来源于周扬的文艺黑线。前文化部拒不执行毛主席的文艺路线，变成了帝王将相、才子佳人部，专门传布资本主义、封建主义、修正主义的反动文艺，成为资产阶级对无产阶级实行专政的工具，是和周扬文艺黑线的统治分不开的。全国文联所属的许多协会变成了修正主义的匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体，是实行周扬的文艺黑线的恶果。大量出笼的坏作品、坏电影、坏戏剧、坏音乐……流毒全国，是在周扬文艺黑线的指导下搞出来的。所有这一切，都是为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。
    在组织上，周扬是反党反社会主义的反毛泽东思想的文艺黑帮的“首领”。他顽固地坚持他在“三十年代”就实行过的那一套资产阶级宗派主义的组织路线，利用自己长期把持的文艺界领导地位，把一些属于他的宗派的人马，安插在中央和全国各地的许多文艺组织中。他有一个小圈圈，就是三十年代同他一起奉行错误路线的资产阶级文艺“元老”，以及用他的资产阶级、修正主义文艺思想塑造出来的门徒。他还收容和吹捧一批封建余孽、汉奸、叛徒、特务、资产阶级反动学术“权威”，组成了文艺界的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮。
    在周扬的文艺黑线统治之下，五十年代末和六十年代初，特别是我国遭遇到自然灾害和赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团捣乱的暂时困难期间，全国的文艺界刮起了一股大黑风。这是三十年代机会主义文艺路线的复活和发展。这个复活和发展，同国内外的反动派相呼应，具有更强烈的反党反社会主义反革命的政治特色！它的触角之广，流毒之深，涉及到大学文科、戏剧界、电影界、文学界、音乐界、新闻出版界等等。这是一个有指挥、有计划、有组织的相互配合着搞起来的反动政治逆流。
    党中央和毛主席发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，揭开了意识形态领域里阶级斗争的盖子，揭开了文艺界黑线统治的盖子，使周扬这些人现了原形。我们一定要把这一场保卫党保卫社会主义保卫毛泽东思想的伟大斗争进行到底，把以周扬为首的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的文艺黑线和文艺黑帮统统打倒！在毛泽东文艺思想的指引下，我们一定能够建设起崭新的无产阶级的、社会主义的文化！
