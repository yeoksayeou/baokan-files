The Chinese Red Cross Society wrote a letter to the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Conference, expressing the warmest congratulations on behalf of the five million members of the Chinese Red Cross Society.

The letter stated, "At a time when the conference is proceeding smoothly, the U.S. imperialists have brazenly launched savage air raids on the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the port city of Haiphong, thereby escalating the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. We express our utmost indignation over this."

The letter pointed out, "The Soviet revisionist leadership is seeking to collaborate with the U.S. to dominate the world. They are pandering to the U.S. and attempting to sell out the fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people. This is something that the revolutionary people of the world will never allow. The members of the Chinese Red Cross Society, together with the people of the entire nation, fully support the statement issued by our government on July 3, and resolutely support the Vietnamese people in their struggle to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors."

The letter said, "The members of the Chinese Red Cross Society are studying and applying Chairman Mao's works extensively, treating Chairman Mao's works as the highest directive for our work. They are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and forging themselves into warriors who are thoroughly proletarian and revolutionary, dedicating all their strength to the socialist construction and socialist revolution of our country."

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on July 7, the entire medical team that had gone to Afro-Asian countries to provide medical services wrote a letter to the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Conference, warmly congratulating the conference on its success. The letter said, "The holding of this conference in Beijing is another heavy blow to imperialism, old and new colonialism, and modern revisionism, and a great encouragement to the fighting peoples of Asia and Africa and the people of the world."

The letter said, "Comrade Mao Zedong has taught us to 'serve the people of China and the world's majority wholeheartedly' and 'to aid the struggle for liberation of the oppressed peoples is our internationalist duty.' Following the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, we have carried forward the spirit of 'saving the wounded and aiding the injured, practicing revolutionary humanitarianism,' and have served the fighting peoples of Asia and Africa. This is our greatest honor."

The letter said, "What moved us most was the deep revolutionary feelings that the peoples of Asia and Africa have for Comrade Mao Zedong. Wherever we went, there were always many friends who enthusiastically expressed their warm greetings to Comrade Mao Zedong. The heroic and tenacious revolutionary spirit of the peoples of Asia and Africa and their love for Comrade Mao Zedong have given us great support and encouragement. We will definitely follow the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong and make our due contributions to the revolutionary cause of the peoples of Asia and Africa."

The letter strongly condemned the new crime of the U.S. imperialists bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, expressing firm support for the solemn statement issued by our government. The letter said, "The Chinese medical team has made all preparations. Once our Vietnamese brothers need us, we will rush to the battlefield in Vietnam at any time to contribute our efforts to the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation."

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on July 7, the Shanghai Football Team, which had visited Afro-Asian countries on friendly visits, sent a telegram to the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Conference, congratulating the successful holding of the conference in Beijing.

The telegram strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' bombing of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the port city of Haiphong, and expressed firm support for the solemn statement issued by our government.

The telegram pointed out, "The U.S. imperialists are the most arrogant aggressors in history and the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world. The Soviet modern revisionists are the accomplices of U.S. imperialism and the betrayers of the revolutionary cause of the peoples of Asia and Africa. The revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa, while opposing U.S. imperialism, must also oppose modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership. The Chinese people share the same breath and destiny with the peoples of Asia and Africa. We will always stand with our revolutionary brothers and sisters in Asia and Africa who are fighting against imperialism. We firmly support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries."

The telegram said, "The U.S. imperialists have forced war on the people, but the peoples of Asia and Africa, relying on armed struggle and the anti-U.S. united front, will definitely defeat U.S. imperialism and win victory in the cause of national liberation. As Chairman Mao pointed out: 'The people of the whole world must have courage, dare to fight, be unafraid of difficulties, and press on wave upon wave. In that case, the whole world will surely belong to the people. All devils will be routed.'"

    我红十字会等热烈祝贺亚非作家紧急会议
    中国人民坚决照毛主席指示支援亚非人民
    据新华社七日讯　中国红十字会写信给亚非作家紧急会议，代表中国红十字会五百万会员向会议致以最热烈的祝贺。
    贺信说，正当会议顺利进行的时候，美帝国主义悍然对越南民主共和国的首都河内和海防进行野蛮轰炸，从而把美帝的侵越战争又升了一级。对此，我们表示极大的愤慨。
    信中指出，苏联修正主义领导集团一心谋求苏美合作主宰世界，迎合美帝，企图出卖越南人民的根本利益，这是世界革命人民坚决不允许的。中国红十字会会员与全国人民一道，完全支持我国政府七月三日的声明，坚决地支持越南人民，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    贺信说，中国红十字会会员正在大学大用毛主席著作，把毛主席的著作当作我们工作的最高指示。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极地投入无产阶级文化大革命，把自己锻炼成为非常无产阶级化、非常革命化的战士，为我国的社会主义建设和社会主义革命贡献一切力量。
    据新华社七日讯　到过亚非国家进行医疗工作的中国医疗队全体队员，写信给亚非作家紧急会议，热烈祝贺这次会议取得成功。贺信说，这次会议在北京召开，是对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和现代修正主义的又一沉重打击，是对战斗中的亚非人民和全世界人民的一个极大鼓舞。
    贺信说，毛泽东同志还教导我们要“全心全意为中国和世界的绝大多数人服务”，“援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”我们按照毛泽东同志的指示，发扬“救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义”的精神，曾为正在战斗中的亚非人民服务，这是我们极大的光荣。
    贺信说，最使我们感动的是，亚非人民对毛泽东同志怀有深厚的革命感情。每到一处，总有许多朋友热情地表示他们对毛泽东同志的亲切问候。亚非人民英勇顽强的革命精神和对毛泽东同志的热爱，给了我们极大的支持和鼓舞。我们一定按照毛泽东同志的指示，为支持亚非人民的革命事业，做出自己应有的贡献。
    贺信强烈谴责美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防的新罪行，表示坚决拥护我国政府的严正声明。贺信说，中国医疗队已经做好一切准备，一旦越南兄弟需要，我们都可随时奔赴越南战场，为越南人民的抗美救国斗争，尽我们的一分力量。
    据新华社七日讯　曾到亚非国家进行过友好访问的上海足球队打电报给亚非作家紧急会议，祝贺这次会议在北京胜利召开。
    电报强烈谴责美帝国主义对越南民主共和国首都河内和海防的轰炸，并表示坚决拥护我国政府的庄严声明。
    贺电指出，美帝国主义是有史以来最狂妄的侵略者，是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。苏联现代修正主义者是美帝国主义的帮凶，是亚非人民革命事业的背叛者。亚非革命人民在反对美帝国主义的同时，不能不反对以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义。中国人民同亚非人民是同呼吸共命运的，我们永远同反帝革命的亚非兄弟们站在一起。我们坚决支持各国人民的反帝革命斗争。
    贺电说，美帝国主义硬把战争强加在人民头上，亚非人民依靠武装斗争和反美统一战线，就一定能够打败美帝国主义，赢得民族解放事业的胜利。正如毛泽东主席指出的：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
