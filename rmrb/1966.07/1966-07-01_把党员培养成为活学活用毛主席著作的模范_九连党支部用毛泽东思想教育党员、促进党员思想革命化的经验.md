Editor's Note: Today marks the 45th anniversary of the founding of our Party. We recommend the experience of the Party branch of the 9th Company of a certain unit in the Shenyang Military Region in using Mao Zedong Thought to educate Party members and promote the revolutionary transformation of Party members' thinking.

The Party branch of the 9th Company has firmly responded to the call of the Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao to "read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." They have long persisted in using Mao Zedong Thought to educate Party members, cultivating Party members into exemplars of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and truly playing the role of a stronghold in the Party branch.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of our Party and the compass for all work. The fundamental task of the Party's grassroots organizations is to arm Party members and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and raise their proletarian consciousness. As the experience of the 9th Company's Party branch says, "The Party branch has a thousand and one tasks, but using Mao Zedong Thought to educate Party members is the first task. Party members must lead in a thousand and one ways, but first and foremost, they must lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works." Only by persistently using Mao Zedong Thought to educate Party members and promote the revolutionary transformation of their thinking can the Party's organizations possess strong combat effectiveness. The 9th Company's Party branch is doing exactly this. Their experience has universal significance and is worth learning from by Party grassroots organizations everywhere.

Since implementing the decisions of the Military Commission's expanded meeting, the Party branch of the 9th Company of a certain unit in the Shenyang Military Region has firmly responded to the call of the Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao to "read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." They have long persisted in using Mao Zedong Thought to educate Party members. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, Party members' consciousness as the vanguard of the proletariat has been continuously raised. They consciously link theory with practice, bring problems to study, and actively apply Chairman Mao's works. They consciously use Chairman Mao's works as weapons to carry out criticism and self-criticism and transform their thinking. They consciously act according to Chairman Mao's teachings to unite and lead the masses and do a good job of ideological work among the masses. Therefore, the Party branch has truly played the core leadership and stronghold role. Since the launch of the "Four Good" campaign, the 9th Company has been rated as "Four Good" every year and has been awarded a collective first-class merit citation.

The exemplary role of Party members must first be reflected in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works

In early 1961, when implementing the decisions of the Military Commission's expanded meeting, the Party branch of the 9th Company required Party members to take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works and bring the study of Chairman Mao's works in the company to a higher level. However, due to the Party branch's insufficient understanding of the profound significance of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and insufficient emphasis on Party members' study, some comrades did not take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They were satisfied with playing a model role in work, believing that completing tasks and talking to the masses when they had problems was enough to be a good Party member. This posed a sharp problem for the Party branch: What kind of exemplary role should Party members play first?

In the 1961 year-end evaluation, the Party branch gained insights from the cases of two Party members. One Party member, who joined the army in 1959 with deep hatred for the old society, joined the Party in 1960 and became a squad leader. He worked hard and excelled in everything he did. However, he was not good at studying Chairman Mao's works. In 1961, when his service term ended, his sister wrote to him to return home to "start a family and establish a career," causing him to waver in his thoughts and his work to decline. Another Party member, Yuan Xile, also came from a poor family, joined the army in 1957, and joined the Party in 1960. He was also an excellent soldier. In 1961, he took the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's books aroused his class consciousness, and the more he read, the more he loved them. At that time, he had already served beyond his term, and his family lacked labor, often writing to him to return home. He said, "Service has a term, but revolution has no term," and he patiently persuaded his family. At that time, the 7th Squad in the company was relatively backward, and he voluntarily requested to go to the 7th Squad. Under his leadership, the squad studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and their ideological appearance was completely transformed. During the "Four Good" evaluation, the Party branch carefully analyzed the situations of these two Party members. The facts clearly told everyone that those who seriously studied Chairman Mao's works would make continuous progress; those who did not study Chairman Mao's works well would not be able to maintain their revolutionary enthusiasm. The Party branch further analyzed the situation of all Party members in the branch and found that some Party members' exemplary roles in work were also good, but when facing intense class struggles at home and abroad, or when facing problems with their families or demobilization, transfers, or promotions, they often had fluctuations in their thoughts. At the critical moment when personal interests conflicted with the Party's interests, they could not stand firm. The Party branch, with this problem in mind, studied a passage from Chairman Mao: "There are many Party members who, while joining the Party organizationally, have not joined the Party ideologically, or even not joined the Party at all. These people, whose minds are not in the Party, still have a lot of filth from the exploiting classes in their heads and do not know what proletarian ideology is, what communism is, and what the Party is." Chairman Mao's teachings made the branch leaders realize that while organizationally recruiting a comrade into the Party is only the beginning of the work. The task of the branch is to make every Party member truly join the Party ideologically, that is, to help them establish a thorough communist worldview. Therefore, it is necessary to educate Party members to persistently study and apply Chairman Mao's works and continuously transform their thinking. From this, they drew a conclusion: The Party branch has a thousand and one tasks, but using Mao Zedong Thought to educate Party members is the first task; Party members must lead in a thousand and one ways, but first and foremost, they must lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Educating Party members to lead in studying, applying, and propagating Mao Zedong Thought

Since then, the Party branch of the 9th Company has always placed the organization of Party members to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the first position, requiring Party members to lead in studying, applying, and propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and become exemplars of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

First, educate Party members to lead in reading Chairman Mao's books, study with class feelings, and study for the revolution.

Party member Xia Shicai's family had endless blood and tears in the old society. During the "Two Remembrances and Three Investigations," Xia Shicai read Chairman Mao's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," and he felt from the bottom of his heart that Chairman Mao's analysis of the peasant problem was like his family history. He deeply loved Chairman Mao's books and the more he read, the more he loved them. The Party branch was inspired by Xia Shicai's experience: They must arouse Party members' class feelings for Chairman Mao's works, so that their study has a solid foundation. Therefore, the branch used Xia Shicai's typical example to educate Party members and mobilized everyone to discuss what attitude to take in reading Chairman Mao's books and how to study and apply them well. Everyone understood that Chairman Mao's books are books for the poor to revolt and are written for the working people, and should be studied with deep class feelings. In this way, they loved Chairman Mao's books even more deeply and studied them more consciously, greatly promoting the activity of studying Chairman Mao's works.

To better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, Branch Secretary Nie Mingqing and Branch Committee Member Yuan Xile specially went to the unit where Mao Zedong Thought study activist Liao Chujiang was located to learn from his experience, bringing back Liao Chujiang's experience of "studying for the revolution." The Party branch first implemented this experience within the Party, calling on Party members to learn from Comrade Liao Chujiang. Party members further realized that Chairman Mao's books are revolutionary books, and Party members are the leaders of the revolution, so they must lead in reading Chairman Mao's books and regard studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as their primary responsibility and fundamental duty.

Over the years, the Party branch of the 9th Company has emphasized "studying with class feelings and studying for the revolution," repeatedly inspiring Party members to love Chairman Mao's works, making Party members' consciousness of reading Chairman Mao's books higher every year. Party members love Chairman Mao's books in their hearts and study them wherever they go. Party member Qi Changdao has a low level of education and could not even read a letter home, but he held onto Chairman Mao's works and especially the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," reading it word by word, sentence by sentence, reading it over and over, marking it over and over, and memorizing it over and over. He didn't know how many times he read it, and the book was marked all over. The teachings of "In Memory of Norman Bethune" were deeply ingrained in his heart. After joining the army, he had done various jobs, such as cooking, feeding pigs, herding sheep, and fishing. Whatever he did, he did it excellently and was rated as a "Five Good" soldier every year. At the beginning of this year, when the old soldiers were demobilized, he volunteered to go to the border. Before leaving, he told the branch, "Chairman Mao's books made me understand the meaning of serving the people. I will definitely study wherever I go."

Second, educate Party members to lead in executing the highest instructions, doing as Chairman Mao says.

Chairman Mao said, "Regarding Marxist theory, one must be able to master it and apply it, and the purpose of mastering it is entirely for application." The Party branch of the 9th Company, in accordance with this teaching, emphasized in organizing Party members to study Chairman Mao's works that they must lead in working hard on the "application." In the initial stage, some Party members mostly applied it to doing a good job in work, but did not apply it vigorously to transforming their worldview, and could not bravely fight against selfish thoughts, indicating that their worldview had not been thoroughly transformed. Therefore, the Party branch repeatedly educated Party members that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is to apply them to transforming the worldview. They focused on the following three points:

First, educate Party members to have a conscious revolutionary spirit, openly express their thoughts without fear of ugliness, and fight against selfish thoughts without fear of pain. Party member Chen Guilin was originally a young actor in the Hebei Provincial Drama Troupe. In 1962, he joined the army with the intention of tempering himself in the army and becoming an actor in the future. The branch repeatedly helped him study Chairman Mao's works, strengthen his ideological transformation, and correct his attitude towards service. His thoughts progressed, and his work performance was excellent, and he joined the Party. However, in 1964, when he participated in the company's performance team and performed in Beijing, receiving praise, he was not happy when he was promoted to squad leader upon his return. He thought that as a squad leader, he would have more work and less time for cultural and entertainment activities, which would limit his talents and affect his future. He reported these thoughts to the Party small group and, with this problem in mind, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on personal interests unconditionally serving the Party's interests. He further examined the thoughts deep in his mind: practicing bayonet thrusts was to make his future performances more realistic; learning from workers and peasants was to understand the emotions of characters; blending in with the masses was to learn dramatic language. In short, it was for his future as an actor, not for wholeheartedly serving the Party's needs. He brought these thoughts out one by one in the small group meeting. Through the help of comrades and his own ideological struggle, he further realized that the Party's future is his future. A Communist Party member should fully play his talents in the position assigned by the Party and should not emphasize his talents and interests to demand that the Party assign him a special position. From then on, he paid more attention to studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and continuously fought against his individualistic thoughts, doing a good job in the squad, and being rated as a "Five Good" soldier every year.

Second, educate Party members to have high standards for ideological revolution, not letting go of any selfish thoughts. Party member Liu Luocheng, in March 1965, when he went home on leave, his mother talked to him about getting married and starting a family. Liu Luocheng had the thought of demobilizing and returning home. As soon as this thought surfaced, he asked himself: I am a Communist Party member, how can I first consider myself when facing problems? Thinking of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the revolution, how can I not first consider the organization's needs and calculate my personal problems? He deeply felt that he was far from the thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. After a struggle in his thoughts, he quickly overcame the thought of demobilizing and returning home and persuaded his mother. At this time, Liu Luocheng thought: When I decided to go home, my resolve was firm, so why did my thoughts waver when I encountered a problem at home? He brought this problem to mind and repeatedly studied a passage from Chairman Mao: "The struggle between socialism and capitalism in our country in the ideological field, as to who will win over whom, will take a fairly long time to decide. ... If one does not have a sufficient understanding of this situation or does not understand it at all, one will commit a very serious error and will neglect the necessary ideological struggle." He thought: The struggle between bourgeois individualism and proletarian collectivism in my mind has not been completely resolved, which is the result of lacking constant self-ideological struggle. If I do not eliminate every bit of selfishness, I cannot completely establish a public spirit. Ideological transformation requires not only resolve but also constant high standards, not letting go of any selfish thoughts. Liu Luocheng drew strength from Chairman Mao's works, and his revolutionary spirit was more solidified. At the beginning of this year, when he was about to demobilize, the superior called on a batch of comrades to go to the border of the motherland to participate in construction. He thought that Communist Party members should regard the world as their home and voluntarily requested to go to the border.

Third, educate Party members to become exemplars of executing the highest instructions, doing as Chairman Mao says. Party member Chen Tingzhi, after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," used the standards of "completely" and "thoroughly" to measure his thoughts and guide his actions. Liu Guoshan, who joined the army later than him, was promoted to deputy squad leader, and he once felt that the leadership looked down on him. However, when he thought of what Chairman Mao said in "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "We should all learn from his spirit of selflessness," he quickly realized his mistake and expressed his determination to act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, to be a noble person, a pure person, a person with morality, a person who has transcended vulgar interests, and a person who benefits the people. He saw that Liu Guoshan's work was not bold enough and took the initiative to talk to him and used his exemplary actions to support Liu Guoshan's work. In 1965, the leadership actively arranged for him to go home on leave three times, and each time he prioritized the company's work, delayed his leave, or let others take his leave. On the afternoon of April 30, 1965, Chen Tingzhi jumped into the reservoir while sick and rescued two children who were about to drown. As soon as he got ashore, he fainted. After being resuscitated, his first words were: "How are the children?" The community saw this scene and was moved to tears, praising him as a good soldier of Chairman Mao. To express gratitude to the PLA, the children's grandmother changed their names to "Xuejun" and "Aijun." The county leadership also highly commended Chen Tingzhi's exemplary deeds and called on the people of the whole county to learn from him. The soldiers in the company also praised him as a good Party member. Comrade Chen Tingzhi said: "This is all because Chairman Mao taught me to do this."

In the process of emphasizing Party members' study of Chairman Mao's works, the Party branch of the 9th Company deeply felt: Study is for application, and application is more important than study. If you study but do not apply, it is as if you have not studied. Whether you apply or not is the dividing line between truly studying Chairman Mao's works and falsely studying Chairman Mao's works. Application is struggle, is revolution. To make Party members play an exemplary role in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the most fundamental thing is to play an exemplary role in "application," to play an exemplary role in transforming the worldview.

Third, educate Party members to actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

The Party branch of the 9th Company, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings that Communist Party members should become models of political work, educated Party members to regard helping the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works as their glorious responsibility and to be models of propagating Mao Zedong Thought, wholeheartedly helping class brothers to master Mao Zedong Thought.

The Party members of the 9th Company help the masses in a thousand and one ways, but the most important thing is to help them study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. In 1964, during a squad attack tactics drill, soldier Zhang Xikun accidentally injured both hands with an explosion. At that time, he had intense inner struggles, feeling that his hands were disabled and he could do nothing. After Zhang Xikun was hospitalized, the Party branch sent Branch Committee Member Wang Keyuan with Chairman Mao's works to visit him, inspiring him to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Moving Mountains with Persistence"; telling him the stories of Xu Xuehui and Huang Changdiao studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to overcome disabilities; educating him that as long as he had a red heart and listened to Chairman Mao's words, even if his hands were injured, he could still continue to serve the people. Zhang Xikun was greatly inspired. In the hospital, he persistently studied Chairman Mao's works, thinking: My fingers are broken, but my thoughts of serving the people cannot be broken. With the will of "Moving Mountains with Persistence," he overcame the pain of his disability and was determined to continue to be a good soldier of the people. After recovering and returning to the company, he, with a heart full of serving the people, trained hard. He couldn't hold a grenade tightly, so he often helped the kitchen carry coal to practice his grip. He said: "I want to use the spirit of 'Moving Mountains with Persistence' to train to remove the big mountain that oppresses the people of the world." His revolutionary will was tempered and became stronger, and he was honorably admitted to the Party. This year, during the construction of the unit, he became a famous advanced wind drill operator in the entire battalion. Zhang Xikun, who used to be able to do things with ten fingers, can now do them with seven fingers; things that he couldn't do with ten fingers, he can now do some of them. Mao Zedong Thought made him a tough soldier.

In propagating Mao Zedong Thought, the Party members of the 9th Company especially pay attention to helping backward comrades. Soldier Wu Shanhai is an urban youth who picked up some bad habits from a young age. After joining the army, he couldn't adapt to the tense life in the army, was not content with his service, often argued with the leadership, and had poor unity with his comrades, making him a backward soldier in the company. Party member Xu Longzhi studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with him repeatedly. In the process of helping, every time he encountered a nail, Xu Longzhi would check his thoughts of serving the people, whether he truly regarded the Party and the people's interests as paramount, and sincerely helped his class brother to progress. One day, Wu Shanhai flipped through Xu Longzhi's notes on studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and saw Xu Longzhi's self-criticism for being a bit impatient in helping him, which deeply moved him. He thought, Comrade Xu Longzhi listens to Chairman Mao's words and sincerely helps me, I am also from a poor family, I should also listen to Chairman Mao's words! He wrote in his diary: "Wu Shanhai, Wu Shanhai, others are so sincere in helping you, are you really heartless?" He then made a self-criticism to Xu Longzhi, saying: "In the future, I will definitely read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." From then on, Wu Shanhai made progress day by day. Later, he joined the League and was rated as a "Five Good" soldier.

Over the years, the Party members of the 9th Company have long persisted in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, leading in studying, applying, and propagating, and their consciousness as the vanguard of the proletariat has been greatly raised, producing batch after batch of active participants in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Since 1961, seven Party members have been named model workers by the leadership at the division level and above, and twenty-nine have grown into cadres, of whom twenty-one have been sent to sister companies. The Party members are praised by everyone as the "reinforcement bars" of the company's construction and the confidants of the masses.

In Party life, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works

The Party branch of the 9th Company uses Mao Zedong Thought to guide all Party activities and, through Party activities, makes Mao Zedong Thought take root in the minds of Party members. They regard the process of Party members participating in Party life as the process of Party members studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Over the years, they have focused on the following four points:

First, grasp a few basic viewpoints, study them repeatedly, apply them repeatedly, and root them repeatedly.

On the one hand, the Party branch requires Party members to lead in studying the common content of the entire company's study; on the other hand, in view of the situation of Party members, it emphasizes studying the special content of Party members, such as Chairman Mao's discussions on the ideals of Party members, the standards of Party members, the exemplary role of Party members, and Party life. Over the years, they have organized Party members to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's five basic viewpoints on being a good Party member: First, the viewpoint on class and class struggle; second, the viewpoint that a Communist Party member must regard revolutionary interests as his first life; third, the viewpoint on criticism and self-criticism; fourth, the viewpoint on uniting and linking with the masses; fifth, the viewpoint on the vanguard and exemplary role of Party members. These viewpoints, they combine with Party life, study repeatedly, apply repeatedly, and gradually take root in the thoughts of Party members. In early 1965, when the company was implementing the instructions to emphasize politics, the Party branch organized Party members to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings that Communist Party members should become models of political work, linking it with the consequences of the company's military impact on politics, raising the understanding of emphasizing politics. They further understood: Chairman Mao requires Party members to become models of political work, which means that Party members must lead in emphasizing politics, lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and lead in revolution. This is the greatest responsibility and the greatest glory of Party members.

The Party branch of the 9th Company realized: The same viewpoint, whether studied with a sense of responsibility as a Party member, the effect is different. Party members reflected: "The branch, in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the stricter the requirements for Party members and the higher the standards, the more Party members feel honored and the more they feel the weight on their shoulders." The Party branch of the 9th Company, in helping Party members study and apply Chairman Mao's works, felt that in addition to general education for Party members, special education for the Party must also be emphasized to make Party members continuously raise their consciousness as the vanguard of the proletariat.

Second, grasp the active thoughts of Party members, making Party members bring problems to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a targeted manner.

Over the years, they have paid attention to the following times to grasp the active thoughts of Party members and organize Party members to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a targeted manner, carrying out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. For example: When class struggles at home and abroad are sharp and complex, in view of the active thoughts of Party members exposed in class struggle issues, they study Chairman Mao's viewpoints on class and class struggle, making Party members stand firm and clear in their stance; when demobilizing and transferring or handling family problems, in view of the active thoughts of Party members in handling the relationship between the Party's interests and personal interests, they study Chairman Mao's discussions on Party members having a great communist goal, firmly establishing a communist worldview; when adjusting the backbone of the company and promoting cadres, in view of the active thoughts of Party members in dealing with the issue of fame and status, they study the viewpoint of regarding revolutionary interests as the first life, establishing the thought of completely and thoroughly serving the people. The Party branch of the 9th Company, through small group meetings and branch committee meetings, mobilized Party members to grasp their own active thoughts and each other's active thoughts. They made sure that everyone's thoughts were open, problems were found mutually, and shortcomings were helped by everyone. They made sure that each Party member brought problems accurately, selected viewpoints accurately, and had good study results.

Third, integrate studying and applying Chairman Mao's works into Party life.

Whether it is giving a Party lesson, making a mobilization, having a Party life, conducting individual talks, praising or criticizing a Party member, the branch uses Chairman Mao's relevant viewpoints as weapons to educate and solve problems. For example, they learn a quotation with a focus on the problem to be solved every time they hold a branch meeting, branch committee meeting, or small group meeting. Party members see how Chairman Mao said it, think about how they did it, and discuss how to do it in the future? Their thoughts are raised, their direction is clear, and the problem is easy to solve. Because the Party branch uses Mao Zedong Thought to guide all Party activities, often giving "drizzles of Mao Zedong Thought," each Party member often receives the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, making Mao Zedong Thought take root little by little in the minds of Party members, and Party members' proletarian consciousness is higher and higher.

Fourth, in a timely manner, conduct "small rectification" for problems with general significance among Party members.

The Party branch of the 9th Company, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings on learning more Marxism through criticism and self-criticism, since 1962, has conducted "small rectification" within the Party in a timely manner for problems with general significance among Party members. The characteristics of this "small rectification" within the Party are to grasp the key problems, in a certain period of time, to thoroughly study a viewpoint, using the methods of criticism and self-criticism, to first destroy and then establish, with establishment in destruction. This "small rectification" has achieved good results in promoting Party members to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carrying out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, and promoting ideological revolution.

    把党员培养成为活学活用毛主席著作的模范
    ——九连党支部用毛泽东思想教育党员、促进党员思想革命化的经验
    某军三级工作组
    编者按：今天是我们党诞生四十五周年纪念日。我们向党的基层组织推荐沈阳部队某部九连党支部的用毛泽东思想教育党员的经验。
    九连党支部，坚决响应军委和林彪同志提出的“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”的号召，长期坚持用毛泽东思想教育党员，把党员培养成为活学活用毛主席著作的模范，真正发挥了党支部的战斗堡垒作用。
    毛泽东思想是我们党的指导思想，是一切工作的指针。党的基层组织的根本任务，就是用毛泽东思想武装党员和群众，提高他们的无产阶级觉悟。正如九连党支部的经验中说的，“党支部工作有千条万条，用毛泽东思想教育党员是第一条，党员千带头万带头，首先是要在活学活用毛主席著作上带好头。”只有坚持用毛泽东思想教育党员，促进党员思想革命化，才能使党的组织具有强大的战斗力。九连党支部正是这样做的。他们的经验具有普遍意义，值得各地党的基层组织学习。
    沈阳部队某部九连党支部，从贯彻军委扩大会议决议以来，坚决响应军委和林彪同志提出的“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”的号召，长期坚持用毛泽东思想教育党员。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，党员的无产阶级先锋队的觉悟不断提高。他们自觉联系实际，带着问题，活学活用毛主席著作；自觉以毛主席著作为武器，开展批评与自我批评，改造思想；自觉按照毛主席的教导，去团结、带领群众，做好群众的思想工作。因此，党支部真正发挥了核心领导和战斗堡垒作用。开展四好运动以来，九连年年被评为四好，还荣立过一次集体一等功。
    党员的模范作用，首先要表现在活学活用毛主席著作上
    一九六一年初，开始贯彻军委扩大会议决议时，九连党支部要求党员在学习毛主席著作中起带头作用，把连队的毛主席著作学习带动起来。但是，由于支部对活学活用毛主席著作的深远意义认识还不够深，对党员的学习抓得不够狠，因此，有些同志并没有很好地带头活学活用，只是满足于工作上起模范作用，认为：完成任务带带头，群众有了问题谈谈话，就是个好党员了。这给党支部提出了一个尖锐的问题：党员究竟应该首先起什么样的模范作用？
    一九六一年年终总评，支部从两个党员的事例中，得到了启示。有一个党员，一九五九年带着对旧社会的深仇大恨来到部队，一九六○年就入了党，当了班长。他工作上以身作则，埋头苦干，干啥啥出色。可是，学习毛主席著作较差，一九六一年服役期满了，姐姐来信要他回去“成家立业”，他思想上就波动起来，工作也下降了。另一个党员叫袁西乐，也是个苦孩子出身，一九五七年入伍，一九六○年入党，也是一个干啥啥出色的好战士。一九六一年，他带头学习毛主席著作。毛主席的书激发了他的阶级觉悟，他越读越爱读。这时，他已经超期服役，家里缺少劳动力，常来信叫他回去。他说：“服役有年限，革命无年限”，主动教育家庭不要忘记阶级苦，耐心说服了家庭。当时，连里的七班比较后进，他主动向领导请求到七班去。这个班在他的带动下，活学活用毛主席著作，思想面貌焕然一新。四好总评时，党支部认真分析了这两个党员的情况。事实清楚地告诉了大家，哪个党员认真学习了毛主席著作，哪个党员就能不断进步；哪个党员不好好学习毛主席著作，哪个党员就不能永葆旺盛的革命热忱。党支部又进一步分析了全支部党员的情况，发现有的党员平时工作上的模范作用也不错，但一遇到国内外阶级斗争激烈的时候，在家庭有了问题或是复员转业、干部提升等时候，往往产生思想波动。在个人利益和党的利益发生矛盾的节骨眼上，过不得硬。党支部带着这个问题，学习了毛主席这样一段话：“有许多党员，在组织上入了党，思想上并没有完全入党，甚至完全没有入党。这种思想上没有入党的人，头脑里还装着许多剥削阶级的脏东西，根本不知道什么是无产阶级思想，什么是共产主义，什么是党。”毛主席的教导使支部领导懂得了，从组织上吸收一个同志入党，还只是工作的开始。支部的任务是要使每个党员真正从思想上入党，也就是帮助他们彻底树立共产主义世界观。因此必须教育党员长期坚持活学活用毛主席著作，不断改造思想。他们由此得出了一个结论：党支部工作有千条万条，用毛泽东思想教育党员是第一条；党员千带头万带头，首先是要在活学活用毛主席著作上带好头。
    教育党员带头学、带头用、带头宣传毛泽东思想
    从这以后，九连党支部始终把组织党员活学活用毛主席著作放在第一位，要求党员带头学、带头用、带头宣传毛泽东思想，成为活学活用毛主席著作的模范。
    第一，教育党员带头读毛主席的书，带着阶级感情学，为革命而学。
    党员夏世才的一家，在旧社会有诉不尽的血泪仇。在两忆三查中，夏世才读了毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》，从心眼里感到，毛主席关于贫农问题的分析，写的就象他的家史一样。他深深爱上了毛主席的书，越读越爱读。党支部从夏世才的身上受到了启示：一定要激发党员对毛主席著作的阶级感情，使他们的学习有一个坚实的基础。于是，支部就用夏世才这个典型事例教育党员，并且发动大家讨论用什么样的态度去读毛主席的书，怎样才能学得好，用得好。大家懂得了毛主席的书是穷人翻身闹革命的书，是给劳动人民写的书，应该怀着深厚的阶级感情去学。这样，对毛主席的书就爱得更深切，读得更自觉，大大推动了学习毛主席著作的活动。
    为了使党员更好地活学活用毛主席著作，支部书记聂明清和支部委员袁西乐，特意到学习毛主席著作积极分子廖初江所在的连队去取经，带回了廖初江“为革命而学”的经验。党支部首先在党内落实这个经验，号召党员人人向廖初江同志学习。党员们进一步认识到，毛主席的书是革命的书，党员是革命的带头人，就要带头读毛主席的书，就要把活学活用毛主席著作当作自己首要的职责、根本的义务。
    几年来，九连党支部抓住“带着阶级感情学，为革命而学”这两条，反复启发党员热爱毛主席著作，使党员读毛主席书的自觉性一年比一年高。党员们对毛主席的书，爱在心上，走到哪里，学到哪里。党员齐长道文化低，连封家信都看不了，可是他抱着毛主席著作不放，特别是《为人民服务》一文，一字一字地认，一句一句地读，读一遍，画一遍，记一遍，不知读了多少遍，把书画得一片红，《为人民服务》的教导，字字装进了他的心里。他入伍后，先后做过饭，喂过猪，放过羊，打过鱼，干哪行，爱哪行，样样干得出色，年年被评为五好。今年初，老战士退伍时，他带头报名去边疆。临走时，他对支部说：“毛主席的书使我懂得了为人民服务的道理，我一定要走到哪里，学到哪里。”
    第二，教育党员带头执行最高指示，毛主席怎么说就怎么做。
    毛主席说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”九连党支部按照这一教导，在组织党员学习毛主席著作中，强调要带头在“用”字上狠下功夫。开始阶段，有些党员多是用在搞好工作上，对改造思想用得不狠，不能勇敢地和私心杂念作斗争，是世界观没有得到彻底改造。因此，党支部反复教育党员，活学活用毛主席著作，就是要用在改造世界观上。他们着重抓了以下三点：
    一、教育党员要有自觉革命精神，亮思想不怕丑，斗私心不怕痛。党员陈桂林，原来是河北省话剧团的青年演员，一九六二年，他抱着到部队锻炼、将来当演员的动机入了伍。支部多次帮助他学习毛主席著作，加强思想改造，端正服役态度，他的思想不断进步，工作表现很好，入了党。但是，一九六四年他参加团里战士演出队，到北京汇报演出受到好评，回连以后提升他当班长时，他却有些不乐意。他想，当了班长，工作多了，搞文娱活动的时间就少了，这样会限制自己的特长，影响自己的前途。他把这些思想向党小组作了汇报，又带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席有关个人利益必须无条件服从党的利益的教导，进一步挖了思想根子，检查了思想深处的东西：苦练刺杀，是为了将来当演员时表演更逼真；学习工农同志，是为了体会人物感情；同群众打成一片，是为了学习戏剧语言。一句话是为了个人将来当演员，而不是全心全意服从党的需要。他又把这些思想一一在小组会上亮了出来，经过同志们的帮助，自己的思想斗争，进一步认识到：党的前途就是自己的前途，一个共产党员，应该在党分配的工作岗位上，充分发挥自己的特长，不应该强调自己的特长和兴趣，去要求党给自己分配特殊岗位。从此，他更加注意活学活用毛主席著作，不断与自己的个人主义思想作斗争，搞好班里的工作，年年都被评为五好战士。
    二、教育党员思想革命要有高标准，不放过一丝私心杂念。党员刘落成，一九六五年三月探家时，母亲和他谈到了结婚成家的问题，刘落成便产生了退伍回家的念头。这个想法刚一露头，他就反问自己：我是个共产党员，遇事怎能先替自己打算呢？想想先烈，为革命牺牲生命都在所不惜，我怎么不首先考虑组织需要就盘算个人问题呢！他深深感到自己离“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想还很远。经过一番思想斗争，很快战胜了想退伍回家的杂念，并说服了母亲。这时，刘落成又想：在动身探家时，决心是很硬的，为什么到家遇上一点问题，思想上就波动呢？他带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席这样一段话：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。……如果对于这种形势认识不足，或者根本不认识，那就要犯绝大的错误，就会忽视必要的思想斗争。”心想：我头脑里资产阶级个人主义和无产阶级集体主义，两种思想谁胜谁负的斗争，也是没有完全解决，这是缺乏经常自我思想斗争的结果。一点一滴的私心不破除，完完全全的公心就树不起来。思想改造光有决心还不行，必须时时坚持高标准，不放过任何私心杂念。刘落成从毛主席著作里吸取了力量，战斗队的思想更巩固了。今年初他将退伍时，上级号召一批同志去祖国边疆参加建设。他想，共产党员应该四海为家，主动要求到边疆去了。
    三、教育党员成为执行最高指示的模范，毛主席怎么说，就怎么做。党员陈廷智，学了《为人民服务》，处处事事用“完全”“彻底”这把尺子，衡量自己的思想，指导自己的行动。入伍比他晚的刘国山提升副班长了，他一度因此感到领导上有些看不起自己。可是，当他想到毛主席在《纪念白求恩》一文里说的：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神”时，很快认识到自己的错误，并且表示坚决要按照毛主席教导的那样，做一个高尚的人，纯粹的人，有道德的人，脱离了低级趣味的人，有益于人民的人。他看到刘国山工作有些不够大胆，就主动去交谈，并且用自己的模范行动，支持刘国山的工作。一九六五年，领导上先后三次主动安排他探家，每次他都以连队工作为重，推迟探家，或把假让给别人。一九六五年四月三十日下午，陈廷智带病跳进水库，抢救了两个将要淹没的儿童。一上岸他就昏倒了。经过急救苏醒过来后，第一句话就问：孩子们怎么样？社员群众看到这般情景，感动得流下了热泪，称赞他是毛主席的好战士。为了感激解放军，小孩的老祖母把两个孩子改名为“学军”、“爱军”。县领导机关也大力表彰陈廷智的模范事迹，号召全县人民向他学习。连里战士也都称赞他是个好党员。陈廷智同志说：“这都是毛主席教导我这样做的。”
    九连党支部在狠抓党员学习毛主席著作“用”字落实的过程中，深深体会到：学是为了用，用是更重要的学。学了不用，等于不学。用和不用，是真学习毛主席著作还是假学习毛主席著作的分水岭。用就是斗争，就是革命。要党员在活学活用毛主席著作上起模范作用，最根本的是要在“用”字上起模范作用，在改造世界观上起模范作用。
    第三，教育党员积极宣传毛泽东思想。
    九连党支部，按照毛主席关于共产党员应成为政治工作的模范的教导，教育党员把帮助群众活学活用毛主席著作，当作自己的光荣责任，当一个毛泽东思想的模范宣传员，满腔热忱地帮助阶级兄弟掌握毛泽东思想。
    九连党员帮助群众，千帮万帮，最重要的是帮助活学活用毛泽东思想。四班战士张喜坤，一九六四年在一次班进攻战术演习中，爆破时不小心炸伤了双手。当时他思想斗争很激烈，感到手残废了，一切都不能干了。张喜坤入院后，党支部就派支部委员王科元带着毛主席著作去探望他，启发他好好学习《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》；给他讲徐学惠、黄崇雕活学活用毛主席著作战胜伤残的故事；教育他只要一颗红心听毛主席的话，即使双手受了伤，还是可以继续为人民服务的。张喜坤受到很大鼓舞。他在医院里顽强地学习毛主席著作，心想：我手指断了，为人民服务的思想不能断。他以“愚公移山”的意志，战胜了伤残的痛苦，决心要继续当好一名人民战士。伤好回到连队，他怀着一颗全心全意为人民服务的心，刻苦锻炼。手榴弹握不紧，他就经常帮助伙房搬煤，练握力。他说：“我要用‘愚公移山’的精神，为搬掉压在世界人民头上的大山而锻炼。”他的革命意志越磨炼越坚强，光荣地入了党。今年部队施工，他还成了全团有名的先进风钻手。张喜坤同志过去十个指头能办到的事情，现在七个指头都办到了；过去十个指头没有办到的事情，现在有的也能办到了。毛泽东思想使他成了一个硬骨头战士。
    九连党员在传播毛泽东思想中，特别重视对后进同志的帮助。战士武善良是个城市青年，从小沾上了一些坏习惯。入伍后，过不惯部队的紧张生活，不安心服役，常和领导顶撞，和同志团结不好，是连里的后进战士。党员徐龙治就和武善良一起反复学习《为人民服务》。在帮助过程中，每碰到一次钉子，徐龙治就检查一次自己为人民服务的思想，是不是真正以党和人民利益为重，真心诚意地帮助阶级兄弟进步。一天，武善良翻阅徐龙治的学习《为人民服务》的心得，看到徐龙治帮助自己有些急躁的检讨，深受感动。他想，徐龙治同志这样听毛主席的话，诚心诚意地帮助我，我也是个苦孩子出身，也应该好好听毛主席的话呀！他在日记上写道：“武善良呀武善良，人家这样诚心诚意帮助你，你莫非是铁心肠。”于是，他向徐龙治作了检讨，说：“今后一定要好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好战士。”从此，武善良就一天天进步起来。后来入了团，评上了五好。
    几年来，九连党员长期坚持活学活用毛主席著作，带头学、带头用、带头宣传，他们无产阶级先锋队的觉悟大大提高，涌现出一批又一批活学活用毛主席著作积极分子。一九六一年以来，有七名党员被师以上领导机关立为标兵，有二十九名成长为干部，其中有二十一名输送给兄弟连队。党员们被大家誉为连队建设的“钢筋”，群众的知心人。
    在党的生活中活学活用毛主席著作
    九连党支部用毛泽东思想指导党的一切活动，通过党的活动，让毛泽东思想在党员头脑里扎根。他们把党员参加党的生活的过程，作为党员活学活用毛主席著作的过程。几年来，着重抓了以下四点：
    第一，抓住几个基本观点，反复学，反复用，反复扎根。
    党支部一方面要求党员带头学好全连学习的共同内容；另一方面，针对党员的情况，又强调学好党员的特殊内容，如毛主席有关党员的理想、党员的标准、党员的模范作用和党的生活等方面的论述。几年来他们组织党员反复学习了毛主席关于作个好党员的五个基本观点：一是关于阶级和阶级斗争的观点；二是关于共产党员必须以革命利益为第一生命的观点；三是关于批评与自我批评的观点；四是关于团结联系群众的观点；五是党员的先锋作用和模范作用的观点。这些观点，他们结合党的生活，反复学，反复用，逐步在党员思想上扎根。一九六五年初，连队在贯彻突出政治的指示的时候，党支部就组织党员反复学习了毛主席关于共产党员应该成为政治工作的模范的教导，联系连队一度军事冲击政治带来的恶果，提高对突出政治的认识。使大家进一步懂得：毛主席要求党员成为政治工作的模范，那就是要求党员带头突出政治，带头活学活用毛主席著作，带头革命，这是党员的最大责任，也是党员的最大光荣。
    九连党支部认识到：同样一个观点，是否带着党员的责任感去学，效果是不同的。党员们反映：“支部在活学活用毛主席著作中，对党员要求得越严格，标准越高，党员越觉得光荣，越感到自己肩上担子重。”九连党支部在帮助党员活学活用毛主席著作中体会到，对党员不仅要有一般教育，还要重视党的特殊教育，才能使党员不断提高无产阶级先锋队的觉悟。
    第二，抓好党员活思想，使党员带着问题，有的放矢地活学活用毛主席著作。
    几年来，他们注意在以下几个时候大抓党员的活思想，有的放矢地组织党员活学活用毛主席著作，开展兴无灭资的思想斗争。比如：在国内外阶级斗争尖锐复杂的时候，针对党员在阶级斗争问题上暴露的活思想，大学毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的观点，使党员立场坚定，爱憎分明；在复员转业前后和处理家庭问题的时候，针对党员处理党的利益和个人利益的关系时出现的活思想，大学关于党员要有共产主义远大目标的论述，牢固地树立共产主义的世界观；在连队调整骨干和提升干部的时候，针对党员在对待名利地位问题上的活思想，大学以革命利益为第一生命的观点，树立完全彻底为人民服务的思想。九连党支部通过小组会和支委会，发动党员自己抓自己的活思想，互相抓活思想。作到思想人人亮，问题互相找，缺点大家帮。使每个党员在活学活用毛主席著作中问题带得准，观点选得准，学习效果好。
    第三，把活学活用毛主席著作，贯穿在党的生活中。
    无论是上一次党课，作一次动员，过一次党的生活，进行一次个别谈话，表扬或批评一个党员，支部都以毛主席的有关观点为武器，进行教育，解决问题。例如，他们每开一次支部大会、支委会、小组会，都针对要解决的问题，有重点地学好一条语录。党员们看看毛主席是怎么讲的，想想自己是怎么做的，议议今后应该怎么办？思想提高了，方向明确了，问题也好解决了。由于党支部用毛泽东思想指导党的一切活动，经常下“毛毛雨”，每个党员经常受到毛泽东思想的哺育，使毛泽东思想一点一滴地在党员头脑里扎根，党员的无产阶级觉悟就越来越高。
    第四，针对党员的带有普遍性的问题，适时进行“小整风”。
    九连党支部按照毛主席关于通过批评和自我批评，可以更多地学到一些马克思主义的教导，从一九六二年以来，针对党员中带有普遍性的问题，适时进行党内“小整风”。这种党内“小整风”的特点是，抓住关键问题，在一定时期内，集中学透一个观点，运用批评与自我批评的方法，先破后立，破中有立。这种“小整风”，对推动党员活学活用毛主席著作，开展兴无灭资斗争，促进思想革命化，收到了很好的效果。　　　　（原载六月三十日《解放军报》）
