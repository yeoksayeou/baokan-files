Nanjing University Arts Students Actively Support the Suggestions of Seven Students from Renmin University
Determined to Be the Vanguard in Smashing the Bourgeois Old Educational System

	The People's Daily reports: Nanjing University Arts Students actively support the letter from seven students of Renmin University to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and are determined to be the vanguard in smashing the bourgeois old educational system.

	After hearing the broadcast, the arts students of Nanjing University's Luyang Branch School were overjoyed and excited. They held discussion meetings, put up big-character posters, and wrote letters to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, actively supporting the daring, bold, and revolutionary spirit of the seven students from Renmin University.

	In a letter from the fourth-year students of the Chinese Department, they wrote: "We participated in the socialist education movement in the countryside two years ago. Since then, we have been discussing whether the arts departments in universities should continue to exist and how they should be run. Over the past few years, we have deeply felt that after entering the arts departments, many people have been buried in the piles of dead people's and foreigners' old papers. A young person full of vitality and daring to think and speak can become an old scholar after a few years of university. In school, although we talk about class struggle, when it comes to specific issues, we forget everything. "A year of actual struggle in the countryside taught us true knowledge and skills that we never learned in the university classroom. We long to live forever among the poor and lower-middle peasants, and we long to fight forever on the front lines of class struggle! We once imagined moving all the arts universities to people's communes and factories, or simply not recruiting high school graduates, but instead selecting qualified individuals from knowledge youth and demobilized soldiers who have undergone a certain amount of labor training, to establish party schools or training classes. However, the old teaching system and old rules and regulations bind our hands and feet." These students expressed their determination to resolutely smash the old educational system, go to the workers and peasants for tempering, and declared to Chairman Mao: "Wherever you point, we will rush there."

	The fourth-year students of the Political Science Department held a discussion meeting, denouncing the harm of the old educational system. They said: "We have studied for four years in the Political Science Department, and all we have learned is a bunch of nonsense. Among the nearly twenty courses, there are courses on feudalism and capitalism, but there are no courses on Chairman Mao's works. The Political Science Department does not study Chairman Mao's works, and without Mao Zedong Thought, how can we have the correct political direction! Locked in the tall buildings of the school, detached from reality, detached from the workers and peasants, and detached from the three great revolutionary movements, how can we truly understand proletarian politics! We firmly want to go to the masses of workers and peasants, to the three great revolutionary movements, to face the wind and rain, to see the world, and to turn the arts universities into schools that actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works.

　　南京大学文科学生积极支持人民大学七同学建议
　　决心做摧毁资产阶级旧学制的先锋
    本报讯　南京大学文科学生，积极支持中国人民大学七位同学给党中央和毛主席的信，决心做摧毁资产阶级旧学制的先锋。
    南京大学溧阳分校文科学生听了广播后，欢欣鼓舞，十分兴奋，纷纷开座谈会，出大字报，写信给党中央和毛主席，积极支持人民大学七位同学敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯的大无畏革命精神。
    中文系四年级同学的信中说：“我们前年参加了农村的社会主义教育运动，从那时起，我们就开始议论大学文科还要不要办，怎样办等一系列的问题。几年来，我们深深感到，不少人考入大学文科以后，就进入了死人洋人的故纸堆中，一个朝气蓬勃、敢想、敢说的青年人，几年大学一读就变成了老夫子。在学校里，虽然口里也讲阶级斗争，可碰到具体问题，什么都忘了。”“农村一年的实际斗争生活，我们学到了在大学课堂里从来没有学到的真知识、真本领。我们多么希望永远生活在贫下中农之间，多么希望永远战斗在阶级斗争的最前线呀！我们曾经设想把全国文科大学都办到人民公社和工厂去，或者干脆不招应届高中毕业生，而每年从经过一定劳动锻炼的知识青年和复员军人中挑选符合条件的人，办党校或轮训班。然而旧的教学制度、旧的框框条条束缚着我们的手脚。”这些同学表示要坚决打碎旧学制，到工农中去锻炼，并且向毛主席表示决心：您指向哪里，我们就向哪里飞奔。
    南京大学政治系四年级学生召开了座谈会，控诉旧的教育制度的毒害。他们说：我们在政治系学了四年，尽学了些乌七八糟的东西。在近二十门课程中，有封建主义、资本主义的各门课程，唯独没有毛主席著作。政治系不读毛主席著作，离开了毛泽东思想，怎么能有正确的政治方向！关在学校的高楼大厦里，脱离实际，脱离工农，脱离三大革命运动，怎么能真正懂得无产阶级的政治！我们坚决要到工农群众中去，到三大革命运动中去，经风雨、见世面，把文科大学变成活学活用毛主席著作的学校。
