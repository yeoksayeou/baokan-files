	Nanning, the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which is on the frontline of supporting Vietnam and resisting U.S. aggression, held an unprecedented large rally and demonstration today with 300,000 people participating. The event firmly supported the Vietnamese people's great struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

	The meeting solemnly declared: The various ethnic groups of Guangxi, together with the people of the entire country, are not afraid of any risks and are willing to pay any price. They are ready at any time to join the Vietnamese people in jointly striking the U.S. aggressors.

	Wei Guoqing, the first secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee and the chairman of the autonomous region, as well as leaders from the region and the city, including Li Renren, Mo Naiqun, Li Yindan, Zhong Feng, Liu Chonggui, Jiao Hongguang, Xiao Han, and Wei Chunshu, attended the meeting.

	Wu Jinnan, a member of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" fully expressed the iron will of the 31 million Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation. Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement reflected the firm determination of the 700 million people of China to support Vietnam and resist U.S. aggression. The people of Guangxi expressed their most resolute support and endorsement.

	Wu Jinnan strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for serving the U.S. imperialists' plot of "bombing to force negotiations." He then pointed out that the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is the southern gateway of the motherland and the frontline of supporting Vietnam and resisting U.S. aggression, serving as the direct rear base for Vietnam. The people of Guangxi, like the people of the entire country, are ready at any time to take actions deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam to jointly strike the U.S. aggressors.

	Consul General Pan Mengju emphasized in his speech that the Vietnamese people resolutely respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call, with the entire military and civilian population united, fearless of sacrifice, and determined to fight to the final victory.

	Pan Mengju said that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement expressed the strongest support from the Chinese people for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. This is a powerful guarantee for the Vietnamese people to defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressors.

	Representatives from various people's organizations in the autonomous region, Zong Lun, and representatives from various democratic parties and non-partisan democrats, Mo Naiqun, also spoke at the meeting. After the meeting, a grand procession marched through the streets. Leaders from the autonomous region and the city, including Wei Guoqing, Wu Jinnan, and Mo Naiqun, led the procession.
