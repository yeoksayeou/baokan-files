On the evening of July 7, it was the last night of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Exhibition in Dar es Salaam. The time was already eleven o'clock at night, and according to the schedule, the exhibition hall should have closed. However, there were still many visitors inside who did not want to leave, and many more continued to enter. In the final moments, a middle-aged African worker came to the exhibition hall and requested a portrait of Chairman Mao from the Chinese staff.

This African worker is a cleaner at a company. During the six days of the Chinese exhibition, he visited approximately ten times. He said, "Chairman Mao is the wisest leader in the contemporary world. No one can compare with Chairman Mao." He had long desired to obtain a portrait of Chairman Mao. He said that he wanted the portrait not for decoration but "because we African people love and respect Chairman Mao." The simple words of this African worker powerfully expressed the boundless admiration of countless Tanzanians and people from other African countries for Chairman Mao.

At the entrance of the exhibition hall, under the bright lights, stood a exquisite giant statue of Chairman Mao. Almost every day, Africans would bow and pay their respects in front of the statue to express their deep respect and admiration for Chairman Mao. Some African youths, upon entering the exhibition hall, would warmly say to the statue, "Chairman Mao, good day!" Every day, Africans would bring their families and friends to take photos in front of the statue, considering it a great honor. An African youth pointed to the statue and said, "Chairman Mao has done many great things for the whole world."

An elderly African worker told the Chinese staff, "Chairman Mao is like the sun. Without the sun, nothing can grow. Your achievements show that you have a wise leader—Chairman Mao!"

Many visitors eagerly inquired about Chairman Mao's health from the Chinese staff. When they learned that Chairman Mao was in good health, they all expressed great joy. Some people told the Chinese staff, "Chairman Mao's good health is not only your happiness but also our happiness, the happiness of all the people of the world." Many visitors wrote in the guestbook, "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life." "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Two friends from Zanzibar said that they had been reading Chairman Mao's works for years. Two freedom fighters from Zimbabwe said: Chairman Mao teaches us that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. The Chinese Revolution and the Russian October Revolution have both proven this. We will also use armed struggle to liberate our country. They excitedly said, "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the proletariat of the whole world will unite and thoroughly eliminate imperialism and colonialism from the world!"

Many visitors shared with the Chinese staff the reasons for their deep admiration for Chairman Mao.

An African friend who had visited China came to the Chinese pavilion. He wore several commemorative badges he had brought back from China. He said, "I have seen with my own eyes the great achievements of the Chinese people. I know that you have achieved such great successes because you read Chairman Mao's books and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts. I am also reading Chairman Mao's books. Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of all the people of the world."

The chief representative of the South West Africa People's Organization here wrote in the guestbook: Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the great Chinese people can create any miracle. A visitor said, "All these achievements are due to Chairman Mao's wise leadership. It is Chairman Mao who has made great efforts to inspire the Chinese people. Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the friendship between Tanzania and China!" A Tanzanian said, "You have a wise leader, Chairman Mao, this is your greatest happiness."

　　坦桑尼亚人民热爱毛主席
    七月七日晚上，是中国工艺美术展览会在达累斯萨拉姆展出的最后一个晚上。时间已是深夜十一点钟，按预定计划该闭馆了。但是展览馆里仍然有着大批参观者，不愿离开，而且，许多人还在继续涌进馆内来。在最后时刻，一位中年非洲工人又来到展览馆，要求中国工作人员送给他一张毛主席象片。
    这位非洲工人在一家公司当清洁工，他在中国展览会展出的六天中参观了约十次之多。他说：“毛主席是当代世界上最英明的领袖。谁都不能同毛主席相比。”他早就渴望得到一张毛主席象片了。他说，他要这张象片不是为了装饰，而是“因为我们非洲人民热爱和尊敬毛主席”。这位非洲工人的朴素的语言有力地表达了无数前来参观的坦桑尼亚人民和其他非洲国家人民无限敬爱毛主席的感情。
    在展览馆入口处，在明亮的灯光下屹立着一座精致的毛主席巨型塑象。几乎每天都有非洲人在塑象面前鞠躬行礼，以表示他们对毛主席的深切敬意和爱戴。有些非洲青年一走进展览馆，就亲热地对着塑象说：“毛主席，您好！”每天都有非洲人带着全家和朋友在塑象前面照相，认为这是他们很大的荣幸。一位非洲青年指着塑象说：“毛主席他老人家为全世界卓越地做了许多大事。”
    一位非洲老工人对中国工作人员说：“毛主席象太阳。没有太阳，万物就不能生长。你们取得的成就表明，因为你们有英明的领袖——毛主席！”
    许多观众极为关心地向中国工作人员探询毛主席的健康。当他们知道毛主席的身体非常好的时候，都表示十分高兴。一些人对中国工作人员说：“毛主席身体健康，这不仅是你们的幸福，也是我们的幸福，是全世界人民的幸福。”许多观众在留言簿上写道：“祝毛主席万寿无疆。”“毛泽东主席万岁！”
    来自桑给巴尔的两位朋友说，他们几年来一直坚持读毛主席的著作。来自津巴布韦的两位自由战士说：毛主席教导我们，枪杆子里面出政权。中国革命和俄国十月革命都证明了这一点。我们也将同样用武装斗争的办法来解放祖国。他们激动地说：“在毛主席的领导下，全世界无产阶级将联合起来，彻底消灭世界上的殖民主义和帝国主义！”
    许许多多的观众向中国工作人员倾谈他们衷心敬爱毛主席的原因。
    一位访问过中国的非洲朋友来到中国馆，他胸前挂着从中国带回来的好几枚纪念章。他说：“我亲眼看到过中国人民的伟大成就。我知道，你们取得这样伟大的成就，是因为你们读毛主席的书，运用毛主席的思想。我也在读毛主席的书。毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是全世界人民的伟大领袖。”
    西南非洲民族联盟驻这里的首席代表博伊斯在留言簿上写道：在毛泽东主席的正确指导下，伟大的中国人民是什么人间奇迹都能创造出来的。一位观众说：“所有这一切成就的取得都是由于毛主席英明的领导。正是毛主席一直作出了巨大的努力以激励中国人民。毛主席万岁！坦桑尼亚和中国之间的友谊万岁！”一位坦桑尼亚人说：“你们有英明的领袖毛主席，这是你们最大的幸福。”
