The golden sun rises in the east, and a propitious rainbow appears in the sky. Chairman Mao's heroic feat of swimming the Yangtze River brings boundless inspiration and strength. The 700 million people of our country will definitely ride the winds and break the waves to march forward to victory.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 29th, "Chairman Mao is the eternal red sun in the hearts of all our ethnic peoples, and Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work. With Mao Zedong Thought, no storm can stop us from advancing!" Workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals of all ethnic groups in our country have expressed their joy and determination with such words upon hearing the news of our beloved great leader Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River.

In the remote regions of our motherland, the people of various ethnic groups in Hohhot, including Mongols, Han, Hui, Manchu, Daur, and Oroqen, enthusiastically cheered "Long live Chairman Mao!" when they heard the news. Workers at the Inner Mongolia Second Textile Mill, who were holding a Cultural Revolution meeting, immediately suspended the meeting, read the newspaper together, and discussed excitedly, with everyone in high spirits and morale boosted. Mongolian worker Tao Yueying, Hui worker Bai Xinshu, and Han worker Wang Guifang were all moved to say that Chairman Mao's feat of swimming the Yangtze River inspires the working class to better temper themselves in the storms of class struggle and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. They said that from the previous stage of class struggle, they deeply felt that only by persistently studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, always remembering class struggle, proletarian dictatorship, emphasizing politics, and holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, can one stay on course and win in the storms of struggle. Worker Song Shenggui (Hui) from the Dyeing and Finishing Workshop said that Chairman Mao's swimming of the Yangtze River this time teaches us to dare to face any risks in struggle and to have the confidence to win. The same goes for fighting against nature and against class enemies.

In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Uygur worker Niyazi Xiedula from the First Machinery Factory said, "Chairman Mao's strong revolutionary willpower has educated us, and we must temper ourselves in the great storms and revolutionary struggles." Xibe welder Jin Jiatu, upon hearing the news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River, was so moved that he shed tears. He said that in the current domestic and international class struggles, no matter how big the storms are, he will forever follow Chairman Mao and stand at the forefront of the struggle. Students and teachers from more than ten ethnic groups at Xinjiang University were in high spirits upon hearing the news. They held discussions in classes, wrote big-character posters, and expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's call to temper their thoughts and willpower in the great storms.

The news reached the northernmost region of Heilongjiang, where the Oroqen people living deep in the forests of the Greater and Lesser Xing'an Mountains cheered for Chairman Mao's longevity with hearts full of love, faith, and admiration. Oroqen cadre Zhu Dianming, who had once seen Chairman Mao, said, "Chairman Mao is the savior of the Oroqen people and of all the people of China and the world. Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. With Chairman Mao, the Oroqen people's hearts will always be bright. We will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution."

In Xining, Qinghai Province, Salar athlete Ma Mingshan from the Qinghai Wrestling Team said that Chairman Mao's swimming of the Yangtze River with such vigor sets a great revolutionary example for the 700 million people of all ethnic groups. He said he would forever follow Chairman Mao and march forward bravely in the storms of class struggle.

When the news reached the Lhasa River Valley, there was a chorus of cheers and songs everywhere. Tibetan serfs sang, "The golden sun rises in the east, and a propitious rainbow appears in the sky. Chairman Mao's swimming of the Yangtze River is a beacon of happiness for all ethnic peoples." Gyangso Qizhen, a former serf and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works from Bangde Village, Dazi County, Bangde Township, excitedly said that Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the Tibetan people. His health is the greatest happiness for all ethnic peoples in the country and revolutionary peoples around the world. She said that since learning Chairman Mao's "Moving Mountains" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," the villagers have gained endless strength and the willpower to overcome any difficulties. United as one, they have chopped mountains and diverted water, carrying out large-scale water conservancy projects, and this year they will achieve their eighth consecutive bumper harvest. She said that in the future, they will better study Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's words, and resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

The news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River greatly inspired the people of Anhui, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and the builders of the Daqing Oil Field.

On September 16, 1958, was an unforgettable day for the people of Anqing. On that day, our most beloved leader Chairman Mao inspected Anqing and swam in the Yangtze River. At that time, those who accompanied Chairman Mao swimming and saw Chairman Mao swimming felt immense happiness seeing Chairman Mao's healthy body and abundant energy. Now, hearing the news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River again in Wuhan, they are even more overjoyed. Xu Chengrong, a young worker from Anqing Paper Mill who accompanied Chairman Mao swimming, excitedly said, "On September 16, 1958, the wind was strong on the river, and the waves were high. Chairman Mao swam for over thirty minutes in the surging waves of the great river with low water temperature. When he got on the boat, he was full of smiles and vigor. Eight years later, Chairman Mao swam in the Yangtze River in Wuhan for one hour and five minutes, covering nearly thirty li. Our great leader Chairman Mao is so healthy, how can I not be overjoyed! Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in our hearts. I will forever follow you and march forward in the great storms."

In hundreds of factories in Shenyang, tens of thousands of workers have been enthusiastically discussing the news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River. National People's Congress representative and one of the initiators of the technical cooperation mass movement in Liaoning Province, technician Wu Dayou from Shenyang High-Voltage Switchgear Factory, recalled the facts of Chairman Mao leading the Chinese people to break through one wave after another in various revolutionary movements and socialist construction, achieving brilliant victories. He excitedly said, "As long as we grasp Mao Zedong Thought and establish the fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, there is no Fire Mountain we cannot cross, no great storm we cannot brave. Our technical cooperation activities are precisely the implementation of Chairman Mao's teachings of daring to struggle and daring to win, developing the spirit of self-reliance. Currently, we are experiencing a Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in this great storm of class struggle, use Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon to sweep away all ghosts and monsters, and smash the anti-party, anti-socialist black line to smithereens." Workers at Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, who are developing new products and scaling scientific and technological heights, heard the news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River and saw Chairman Mao's teaching that some big things in the world are actually not scary. They were all full of confidence. They said, "No matter how big the difficulties are, as long as we have Mao Zedong Thought, we will advance despite the difficulties and definitely produce new products in a short period."

The news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River reached the advanced unit of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, Fangxiang Brigade in Yanzhou County, Jiangsu Province. The men, women, old, and young of the brigade cheered and danced, spreading the news. Many poor and lower-middle peasants listened to someone reading the news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River while looking at the photo of their beloved leader, tears of happiness streaming down their faces. Their hearts were filled with boundless love, faith, and respect for Chairman Mao. They shouted enthusiastically, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" The slogans echoed throughout the village and fields. The young militia of the brigade expressed their determination to learn from Chairman Mao's fearless revolutionary spirit, strong willpower, and perseverance through revolutionary actions.

While cheering for Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River, the members of Fangxiang Brigade further launched a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They said, "Chairman Mao's works are great, every word is a treasure, shining light on the world, the red flag of revolution flies in the wind." "Mao Zedong Thought is the pillar of revolution, the guide, the steering wheel. Studying Chairman Mao's works, we stand tall, see far, and remain unshaken in great storms." Brigade activist and team secretary Lu Guangde said, "Chairman Mao's great revolutionary spirit of conquering nature is the greatest inspiration for us, bringing us boundless confidence and strength. We must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We must dare to be critics of the old world, fight against all ghosts and monsters, fight against old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, fight against nature, and transform society and nature, forever being revolutionaries."

The news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River reached the cities of Qingdao, Yantai, Zibo, Zaozhuang, and Weifang, and the broad masses of people cheered for Chairman Mao's health. Worker Zhang Guangzhe from Yantai Bearing Factory said, "Chairman Mao's swimming of the Yangtze River gives us the courage to overcome all difficulties. With Chairman Mao's guidance, even if the sky falls, we can prop it up, and even if the earth splits, we can stand firm. No storm can stop us from advancing!" Five Good Worker Wang Xuewen from Qingdao Four Square Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory said, "Chairman Mao's decades of revolutionary struggle are the highest examples for our actions. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go into the great rivers and seas to temper ourselves, go into the storms of class struggle to temper ourselves, learn to swim in the rivers, learn the art of class struggle, and definitely steer the revolutionary ship to communism."

Basketball player Wang Zhenyi, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works from the Henan Provincial Sports Training Class, said, "Chairman Mao's swimming in the great storms of the Yangtze River is a symbol of our entire revolutionary cause riding the winds and breaking the waves to march forward to victory. Revolution is about overcoming difficulties in great storms to keep advancing. We must carry on the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn more from Chairman Mao's works in the storms of class struggle, and hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought high and firm."

The news of Chairman Mao riding the winds and breaking the waves to swim the Yangtze River reached the Daqing Oil Field, and cheers echoed throughout the oil field and the vibrant land. Five Good Worker Yao Jianlin, a young driller from the Petroleum Industry Ministry, said, "We will follow Chairman Mao and march forward bravely in the great storms. Our drilling is like swimming; we must dare to drill and dare to pioneer. Our team is drilling China's first ultra-deep well, which has never been done before. Chairman Mao's great revolutionary spirit of swimming the Yangtze River and conquering nature has given us great inspiration. We will face the great storms and walk on, 'no matter how the wind blows or the waves beat, we will stride forward like in a courtyard,' and resolutely drill the ultra-deep well, pioneering a path for China to drill deep wells." Worker Zhang Yuyou from the Fourth Comprehensive Team of the First Oil Production Department of Daqing said, "Chairman Mao teaches us that some big things in the world are actually not scary. This is an absolute truth. The U.S. imperialists are bombing and shelling Vietnam, seemingly very fierce, but they have been beaten to a pulp by the Vietnamese people. Daqing was once a vast wilderness, but because we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, now we not only have developed this great oil field but also created a world-class standard and managed this great oil field."

On July 29, more than 5,000 swimmers in Changsha, Hunan Province, enthusiastically held a summer cross-Yangtze River swimming competition in the Xiangjiang River, where the great leader Chairman Mao once swam, in response to Chairman Mao's great call. This is a group of students carrying the slogan "Following Chairman Mao, we march forward in the great storms!" and breaking the waves forward.

    毛主席畅游长江的喜讯，极大地振奋着安徽、辽宁、江苏、山东、河南等地的人民群众，极大地振奋着大庆油田的建设者。
    一九五八年九月十六日，是安庆市人民终生难忘的日子。这一天，我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席到安庆视察并且畅游了长江。那时，陪同毛主席游泳和看到毛主席游泳的人们，见到毛主席身体那样健康，精力那样充沛，感到无比的幸福。现在，他们听到毛主席在武汉又一次畅游长江的喜讯，更是感到万分高兴。曾陪同毛主席游泳的安庆专区高河纸厂青年工人许成荣激动地说：“一九五八年九月十六日那一天，江面上刮着大风，白浪滔滔，毛主席在波涛滚滚、水温又低的大江中，畅游了三十多分钟，上船时，满面笑容，神采奕奕。时隔八年，毛主席这次又在武汉长江中畅游了一小时零五分钟，游程近三十华里。我们伟大的领袖毛主席身体是这样健康，叫我怎能不万分高兴啊！毛主席，你是我们心中的红太阳，我一定要永远跟着你在大风大浪中前进。”
