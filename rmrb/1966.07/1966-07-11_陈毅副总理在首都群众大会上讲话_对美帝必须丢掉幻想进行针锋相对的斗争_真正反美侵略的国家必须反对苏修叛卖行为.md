Vice Premier Chen Yi Speaks at the Capital's Mass Rally:
We Must Abandon Illusions and Engage in a Head-on Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism; Countries Truly Opposing U.S. Aggression Must Oppose Soviet Revisionist Betrayal

	Starting from June 29, U.S. imperialism has continuously bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the second-largest city in North Vietnam, Haiphong. The war claws of the United States have reached the heart of the Vietnamese people, escalating the aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious stage. This is the most barbaric and wanton war action by U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people. It is the most serious and blatant sabotage of peace in Asia and the world. The mad war adventure of U.S. imperialism has aroused the indignation and strong condemnation of the people of the world. A new wave of anti-U.S. and aid-Vietnam is surging in various parts of the world.

	Today, people from all walks of life in our capital are gathered here to solemnly denounce the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism in escalating the aggression against Vietnam and to express the resolute determination of the 700 million Chinese people to fully support the great struggle of the Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save their country. On behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, I extend the highest respect to the heroic Vietnamese people.

	U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Vietnam with the aim of permanently occupying South Vietnam and using it as a base to invade North Vietnam, the entire Indochina Peninsula, and neighboring countries, as well as China and the entire Asian continent. To realize this arrogant ambition, U.S. imperialism has been waging war in Vietnam for seven years. It has sent nearly 300,000 troops to South Vietnam, bombed North Vietnam for 17 months, and used all kinds of inhumanly brutal methods and various political deceptions and conspiracies.

	However, all these actions have not been able to subdue the heroic Vietnamese people or save U.S. imperialism from its deepening and inextricable predicament in the war of aggression. In particular, in recent times, the so-called "dry season offensive" launched by U.S. imperialism has suffered a crushing defeat, and the conspiracy for peace talks has repeatedly failed. The puppet regime it supports is on the verge of collapse. It is precisely in this situation of internal and external difficulties and no way out that the Johnson administration has taken the adventurous road of further escalating the war of aggression. The bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by U.S. imperialism is a manifestation of its desperation and cornered struggle in the war of aggression, and a desperate struggle in the face of the united and increasingly fierce Vietnamese people.

	In the war of aggression against Vietnam, U.S. imperialism has always used military blackmail to carry out the conspiracy for peace talks and used the conspiracy for peace talks to cover up its actions to escalate the war. The order of the Johnson administration to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong is a continuation of this counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy. It attempts to use the blackmail of air raids on the heart of Vietnam to force a "peace talk" situation. U.S. imperialism thinks that as long as it drops bombs on the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, it can bomb the Vietnamese people into submission and force them to stop their struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save their country. This is sheer delusion! The entire heroic Vietnamese people, from the South to the North, from the sky to the ground, have repeatedly given U.S. imperialism heavy blows. This is a powerful response to the American bandits. The Chinese people, together with the people of the world, enthusiastically cheer the brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in the war to resist U.S. aggression and save their country.

	Where there is aggression, there is resistance. Since U.S. imperialism has crossed the ocean to send troops to South Vietnam to launch a barbaric war of aggression, the 14 million people of South Vietnam will naturally rise up to fight back, and the 17 million people of North Vietnam will naturally support their fellow countrymen in the South. All peace-loving countries and peoples in the world will naturally support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save their country.

	In fact, since the United States began bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, it has broken the boundary between South and North Vietnam. Now, the action of U.S. imperialism bombing Hanoi and Haiphong has further broken the boundary of the war and completely torn up the Geneva Agreement. Under these circumstances, it is only natural and justified for the people of North Vietnam to support the people of South Vietnam in any way and to any extent. Chairman Ho Chi Minh solemnly declared in December 1965: "Vietnam is one country, and the Vietnamese people are one nation. As fellow countrymen, the people of the North will certainly support the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle of the people of the South with all their hearts and souls, just as the people of the South will contribute with all their hearts and souls to defend their homeland in the North." He also said: "We will not surrender to the aggression of U.S. imperialism," "Our people are determined to fight on, to make sacrifices, for ten years, twenty years, or even longer, until we achieve complete victory." The attempt of U.S. imperialism to threaten the Vietnamese people with "increasing the cost" will never be achieved!

	The bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by U.S. imperialism not only gives the people of South and North Vietnam the right to further support each other but also gives the people of the world the right to further support the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save their country. Since U.S. imperialism has broken the boundary of the war of aggression with its own hands, it cannot expect all anti-aggression countries and peoples to be constrained in their actions.

	The action of the United States to escalate the war of aggression against Vietnam once again proves that the nature of U.S. imperialism will not change. No matter what face it puts on, it is the same. Chairman Mao said: "U.S. imperialism is externally strong but internally weak. We must have a clear head, which includes not believing the 'good words' of imperialism and not being afraid of the threats of imperialism." For such a cunning and vicious enemy as U.S. imperialism, we must not harbor any unrealistic illusions but can only engage in a head-on struggle with it. We are firmly convinced that the heroic Vietnamese people, after a long struggle, will surely be able to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors and realize their sublime wish to liberate the South and unify the country.

	Comrades and friends! In the midst of U.S. imperialism's plot of "bombing to force peace talks," the Soviet revisionist leadership group has further played the shameful role of an accomplice. The bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by U.S. imperialism this time is completely a result of collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The U.S. State Department admitted that the United States had previously informed the "major concerned governments," including the Soviet Union, of its decision to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong. Rusk bluntly demanded that the Soviet revisionist leadership "take action to help the United States achieve peace there." After the United States bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, the Soviet leadership group continued to advocate a peaceful solution to the Vietnam problem and repeatedly expressed that the U.S. bombing would not affect the U.S.-Soviet joint arms control agreement. This completely exposed the black curtain of collusion and collusion between the U.S. and Soviet governments on the Vietnam issue and further fully exposed the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership group in its false support and true betrayal of the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save their country.

	The Soviet leadership group has always colluded with U.S. imperialism on the Vietnam issue, serving the conspiracy for peace talks of Johnson, and attempting to bring the Vietnam issue into the track of U.S.-Soviet cooperation. They are promoting d√©tente and arms control in Europe, allowing the United States to free up forces to deal with the Vietnamese people. They are conducting military deployments on the Chinese border, coordinating with U.S. imperialism to encircle China. They are fabricating lies and slanders everywhere, saying that China is obstructing the transit of aid to Vietnam, attempting to undermine the unity of the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples and the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save their country. The matter is clear: the Soviet revisionist leadership group is further intensifying its collusion with U.S. imperialism in "joint actions," sabotaging the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. Therefore, all countries that truly oppose U.S. imperialist aggression must also oppose the betrayal of the Soviet revisionists, and must draw a clear line with their "joint actions" to sell out the revolutionary interests of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of the world.

	Facing the mad escalation of the war of aggression against Vietnam by U.S. imperialism, the more than 30 million heroic Vietnamese people are united in spirit and have launched a nationwide war of resistance against aggression, fully demonstrating the power of people's war and achieving one victory after another. The people of North Vietnam have exposed the myth of the U.S. "air superiority," and the people of South Vietnam have repeatedly given the U.S. aggressors heavy blows. The victories of the Vietnamese people's struggle against aggression have vividly proven that people's war is the most effective weapon against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs; what is truly powerful is not the modern weapons of U.S. imperialism, but the revolutionary people who dare to fight and dare to win.

	Vietnam is a neighbor and brother of China. The Chinese people have always unconditionally supported the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save their country in all aspects. Now that U.S. imperialism has pushed the war of aggression against Vietnam to a new stage, the Chinese people cannot stand idly by and let U.S. imperialism continue its wanton actions.

	The Chinese government has solemnly declared: We will take actions we deem necessary based on the interests of the Vietnamese people and the requirements of the Vietnamese people at any time. No matter how far U.S. imperialism escalates the war, no matter what the cost, we will definitely carry on the struggle to aid Vietnam and resist the U.S. to the end until the Vietnamese people achieve final victory.

	Down with U.S. imperialism!

	Long live the heroic Vietnamese people!
