Vice Premier Chen Yi Speaks at the Capital's Mass Rally:
We Must Abandon Illusions and Engage in a Head-on Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism; Countries Truly Opposing U.S. Aggression Must Oppose Soviet Revisionist Betrayal

	Starting from June 29, U.S. imperialism has continuously bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the second-largest city in North Vietnam, Haiphong. The war claws of the United States have reached the heart of the Vietnamese people, escalating the aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious stage. This is the most barbaric and wanton war action by U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people. It is the most serious and blatant sabotage of peace in Asia and the world. The mad war adventure of U.S. imperialism has aroused the indignation and strong condemnation of the people of the world. A new wave of anti-U.S. and aid-Vietnam is surging in various parts of the world.

	Today, people from all walks of life in our capital are gathered here to solemnly denounce the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism in escalating the aggression against Vietnam and to express the resolute determination of the 700 million Chinese people to fully support the great struggle of the Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save their country. On behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, I extend the highest respect to the heroic Vietnamese people.

	U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Vietnam with the aim of permanently occupying South Vietnam and using it as a base to invade North Vietnam, the entire Indochina Peninsula, and neighboring countries, as well as China and the entire Asian continent. To realize this arrogant ambition, U.S. imperialism has been waging war in Vietnam for seven years. It has sent nearly 300,000 troops to South Vietnam, bombed North Vietnam for 17 months, and used all kinds of inhumanly brutal methods and various political deceptions and conspiracies.

	However, all these actions have not been able to subdue the heroic Vietnamese people or save U.S. imperialism from its deepening and inextricable predicament in the war of aggression. In particular, in recent times, the so-called "dry season offensive" launched by U.S. imperialism has suffered a crushing defeat, and the conspiracy for peace talks has repeatedly failed. The puppet regime it supports is on the verge of collapse. It is precisely in this situation of internal and external difficulties and no way out that the Johnson administration has taken the adventurous road of further escalating the war of aggression. The bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by U.S. imperialism is a manifestation of its desperation and cornered struggle in the war of aggression, and a desperate struggle in the face of the united and increasingly fierce Vietnamese people.

	In the war of aggression against Vietnam, U.S. imperialism has always used military blackmail to carry out the conspiracy for peace talks and used the conspiracy for peace talks to cover up its actions to escalate the war. The order of the Johnson administration to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong is a continuation of this counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy. It attempts to use the blackmail of air raids on the heart of Vietnam to force a "peace talk" situation. U.S. imperialism thinks that as long as it drops bombs on the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, it can bomb the Vietnamese people into submission and force them to stop their struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save their country. This is sheer delusion! The entire heroic Vietnamese people, from the South to the North, from the sky to the ground, have repeatedly given U.S. imperialism heavy blows. This is a powerful response to the American bandits. The Chinese people, together with the people of the world, enthusiastically cheer the brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in the war to resist U.S. aggression and save their country.

	Where there is aggression, there is resistance. Since U.S. imperialism has crossed the ocean to send troops to South Vietnam to launch a barbaric war of aggression, the 14 million people of South Vietnam will naturally rise up to fight back, and the 17 million people of North Vietnam will naturally support their fellow countrymen in the South. All peace-loving countries and peoples in the world will naturally support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save their country.

	In fact, since the United States began bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, it has broken the boundary between South and North Vietnam. Now, the action of U.S. imperialism bombing Hanoi and Haiphong has further broken the boundary of the war and completely torn up the Geneva Agreement. Under these circumstances, it is only natural and justified for the people of North Vietnam to support the people of South Vietnam in any way and to any extent. Chairman Ho Chi Minh solemnly declared in December 1965: "Vietnam is one country, and the Vietnamese people are one nation. As fellow countrymen, the people of the North will certainly support the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle of the people of the South with all their hearts and souls, just as the people of the South will contribute with all their hearts and souls to defend their homeland in the North." He also said: "We will not surrender to the aggression of U.S. imperialism," "Our people are determined to fight on, to make sacrifices, for ten years, twenty years, or even longer, until we achieve complete victory." The attempt of U.S. imperialism to threaten the Vietnamese people with "increasing the cost" will never be achieved!

	The bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by U.S. imperialism not only gives the people of South and North Vietnam the right to further support each other but also gives the people of the world the right to further support the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save their country. Since U.S. imperialism has broken the boundary of the war of aggression with its own hands, it cannot expect all anti-aggression countries and peoples to be constrained in their actions.

	The action of the United States to escalate the war of aggression against Vietnam once again proves that the nature of U.S. imperialism will not change. No matter what face it puts on, it is the same. Chairman Mao said: "U.S. imperialism is externally strong but internally weak. We must have a clear head, which includes not believing the 'good words' of imperialism and not being afraid of the threats of imperialism." For such a cunning and vicious enemy as U.S. imperialism, we must not harbor any unrealistic illusions but can only engage in a head-on struggle with it. We are firmly convinced that the heroic Vietnamese people, after a long struggle, will surely be able to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors and realize their sublime wish to liberate the South and unify the country.

	Comrades and friends! In the midst of U.S. imperialism's plot of "bombing to force peace talks," the Soviet revisionist leadership group has further played the shameful role of an accomplice. The bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by U.S. imperialism this time is completely a result of collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The U.S. State Department admitted that the United States had previously informed the "major concerned governments," including the Soviet Union, of its decision to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong. Rusk bluntly demanded that the Soviet revisionist leadership "take action to help the United States achieve peace there." After the United States bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, the Soviet leadership group continued to advocate a peaceful solution to the Vietnam problem and repeatedly expressed that the U.S. bombing would not affect the U.S.-Soviet joint arms control agreement. This completely exposed the black curtain of collusion and collusion between the U.S. and Soviet governments on the Vietnam issue and further fully exposed the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership group in its false support and true betrayal of the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save their country.

	The Soviet leadership group has always colluded with U.S. imperialism on the Vietnam issue, serving the conspiracy for peace talks of Johnson, and attempting to bring the Vietnam issue into the track of U.S.-Soviet cooperation. They are promoting détente and arms control in Europe, allowing the United States to free up forces to deal with the Vietnamese people. They are conducting military deployments on the Chinese border, coordinating with U.S. imperialism to encircle China. They are fabricating lies and slanders everywhere, saying that China is obstructing the transit of aid to Vietnam, attempting to undermine the unity of the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples and the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save their country. The matter is clear: the Soviet revisionist leadership group is further intensifying its collusion with U.S. imperialism in "joint actions," sabotaging the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. Therefore, all countries that truly oppose U.S. imperialist aggression must also oppose the betrayal of the Soviet revisionists, and must draw a clear line with their "joint actions" to sell out the revolutionary interests of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of the world.

	Facing the mad escalation of the war of aggression against Vietnam by U.S. imperialism, the more than 30 million heroic Vietnamese people are united in spirit and have launched a nationwide war of resistance against aggression, fully demonstrating the power of people's war and achieving one victory after another. The people of North Vietnam have exposed the myth of the U.S. "air superiority," and the people of South Vietnam have repeatedly given the U.S. aggressors heavy blows. The victories of the Vietnamese people's struggle against aggression have vividly proven that people's war is the most effective weapon against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs; what is truly powerful is not the modern weapons of U.S. imperialism, but the revolutionary people who dare to fight and dare to win.

	Vietnam is a neighbor and brother of China. The Chinese people have always unconditionally supported the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save their country in all aspects. Now that U.S. imperialism has pushed the war of aggression against Vietnam to a new stage, the Chinese people cannot stand idly by and let U.S. imperialism continue its wanton actions.

	The Chinese government has solemnly declared: We will take actions we deem necessary based on the interests of the Vietnamese people and the requirements of the Vietnamese people at any time. No matter how far U.S. imperialism escalates the war, no matter what the cost, we will definitely carry on the struggle to aid Vietnam and resist the U.S. to the end until the Vietnamese people achieve final victory.

	Down with U.S. imperialism!

	Long live the heroic Vietnamese people!

### 陈毅副总理在首都群众大会上讲话　对美帝必须丢掉幻想进行针锋相对的斗争　真正反美侵略的国家必须反对苏修叛卖行为

　　陈毅副总理在首都群众大会上讲话
　　对美帝必须丢掉幻想进行针锋相对的斗争  真正反美侵略的国家必须反对苏修叛卖行为
    从六月二十九日开始，美帝国主义连续轰炸越南民主共和国的首都河内市，轰炸越南北方第二个大城市海防。美国的战争魔爪已经伸到越南人民的心脏地区，把侵略越南的战争上升到一个新的更严重的阶段。这是美帝国主义对越南人民最野蛮、最猖狂的战争行动。这是对亚洲和平和世界和平的最严重、最露骨的破坏。美帝国主义这种疯狂的战争冒险，激起了全世界人民无比愤怒和强烈谴责。一个反美援越的新浪潮正在世界各地兴起。
    今天，我们首都各界人民在这里隆重集会，声讨美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的滔天罪行，表达七亿中国人民全力支持越南人民伟大抗美救国斗争的坚强决心。我代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，向英雄的越南人民致以最崇高的敬意。
    美帝国主义发动侵略越南的战争，它的目的是要永远霸占越南南方，把越南南方作为它侵略越南北方、侵略整个印度支那以及周围的国家、侵略中国和整个亚洲的基地。为了实现这个狂妄的野心，美帝国主义在越南进行了长达七年之久的战争。它派进越南南方近三十万的侵略军，对越南北方进行了十七个月的狂轰滥炸，使用了一切灭绝人性的残暴手段和各种各样的政治欺骗阴谋。
    但是，所有这些，都没有能够使英雄的越南人民屈服，都没有能够挽救它在侵略战争中愈陷愈深、不能自拔的困境。特别是最近一个时期，美帝国主义发动的所谓“旱季攻势”遭到惨败，和谈阴谋接连破产，它所扶植的傀儡政权濒于土崩瓦解。正是在这种内外交困、进退维谷的情况下，约翰逊政府走上了进一步扩大侵略战争的冒险道路。美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防，正是它在侵略战争中走投无路、狗急跳墙的表现，正是它在团结一致、愈打愈狠的越南人民面前表现出的一种绝望的挣扎。
    美帝国主义在侵略越南的战争中，一贯以军事讹诈推行和谈阴谋，以和谈阴谋掩盖扩大战争的行动。约翰逊政府下令轰炸河内和海防，就是这种反革命两手策略的继续。它企图用空袭越南心脏的讹诈，来逼出一个“和谈”的局面。美帝国主义以为，只要它把炸弹扔到越南民主共和国的首都，就可以炸倒越南人民，就可以迫使他们停止抗美救国的斗争。这完全是痴心妄想！全体英雄的越南人民，从南方到北方，从天空到地上，不断给美帝国主义以沉重的打击。这就是对美国强盗的有力回答。中国人民同全世界人民一道，热烈地欢呼越南人民在抗美救国战争中所取得的辉煌胜利。
    哪里有侵略，哪里就有反抗。美帝国主义既然远涉重洋，派兵到越南南方发动了一场野蛮的侵略战争，一千四百万越南南方人民当然要起而抗战，一千七百万越南北方人民当然要支援南方的骨肉同胞。全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民，当然要支援越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争。
    事实上，自从美国开始了对越南民主共和国的轰炸以来，它就打破了越南南方和北方的界限。现在，美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防的行动，就进一步打破了战争的界限，彻底地撕毁了日内瓦协议。在这种情况下，越南北方人民不论用什么方式、在多大规模上、支援越南南方人民，都是天经地义、理所当然的。胡志明主席在一九六五年十二月就庄严宣告：“越南是一个国家，越南民族是一个整体。作为骨肉的同胞，北方人民一定全心全力支援南方同胞的抗美爱国斗争，正如南方人民全心全力地为保卫自己祖国的北方而作出贡献一样。”他又说：“我们决不屈服于美帝国主义的侵略”，“我国人民决心坚持战斗，忍受牺牲，不管十年、二十年或更长的时间，直到取得完全胜利。”美帝国主义企图用什么“提高代价”来威胁越南人民，这个目的是绝对达不到的！
    美帝国主义对河内和海防的轰炸，不仅使越南南北两方人民进一步取得了相互支援的权利，同时也使全世界人民进一步取得了支援越南人民抗美救国斗争的权利。美帝国主义既然用自己的手打破了侵略战争的界限，他就不能指望一切反侵略的国家和人民，在行动上再受任何约束。
    美国扩大侵略越南战争的行动，再一次证明，美帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的。不论它装出什么样的面孔，都是一样。毛主席说：“美国帝国主义是外强中干的。我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”对于美帝国主义这样凶恶和狡猾的敌人，决不能抱有任何不切实际的幻想，而只能同它进行针锋相对的斗争。我们坚信，英雄的越南人民，经过长期斗争，一定能够彻底打败美国侵略者，实现解放南方、统一祖国的崇高愿望。
    同志们，朋友们！在美帝国主义玩弄“以炸迫和”的阴谋中，苏联修正主义领导集团进一步扮演了可耻的帮凶角色。美帝国主义这次轰炸河内、海防，完全是美苏串通一气搞出来的。美国国务院承认，美国在事先曾把轰炸河内、海防的决定通知了包括苏联在内的“主要有关政府”。腊斯克并且直截了当地要求苏联修正主义领导“行动起来，帮助美国在那里取得和平”。在美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防之后，苏联领导集团继续鼓吹和平解决越南问题，并且再三表示，美国的轰炸将不影响美、苏共同达成裁军协议。这就完全揭开了美、苏两国政府在越南问题上互相勾结、狼狈为奸的黑幕，更加充分地暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团对越南人民抗美救国斗争的假支持、真出卖的叛徒面目。
    苏联领导集团一贯在越南问题上同美帝国主义勾勾搭搭，为约翰逊的和谈阴谋效劳，妄图把越南问题纳入美苏合作的轨道。他们在欧洲搞缓和，搞裁军，让美国抽出力量对付越南人民。他们在中国边界进行军事部署，配合美帝国主义包围中国。他们到处无中生有，造谣诬蔑，说中国阻挠援越物资过境，企图破坏中越两国人民的团结，破坏越南人民的抗美救国战争。事情很清楚，苏联修正主义领导集团正在变本加厉地同美帝国主义大搞“联合行动”，破坏世界各国人民的革命斗争。因此，一切真正反对美帝国主义侵略的国家，必须同时反对苏联修正主义的叛卖行为，必须同它出卖越南人民和世界人民革命利益的“联合行动”，划清界限。
    面对着美帝国主义疯狂地扩大侵略越南的战争，三千多万英雄的越南人民同心同德，同美帝国主义展开了一场全民性的反侵略战争，极大地发挥了人民战争的威力，取得了一个又一个的胜利。越南北方人民戳穿了美国所谓“空中优势”的神话，越南南方人民一次又一次地给予美国侵略者以沉重的打击。越南人民反侵略斗争的胜利，最生动不过地证明人民战争是对付美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝；真正强大的不是美帝国主义的现代化武器，而是敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命人民。
    越南是中国唇齿相依的邻邦和兄弟。中国人民一贯无保留地从各方面支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争。现在，美帝国主义既然把侵略越南的战争推进到一个新的阶段，中国人民决不能听任美帝国主义继续胡作非为。
    中国政府已经郑重声明：我们将根据越南人民的利益，根据越南人民的要求，随时采取我们认为必要的行动。不管美帝国主义把战争扩大到什么地步，不管要付出多大的代价，我们一定要把援越抗美的斗争进行到底，直到越南人民取得最后的胜利。
    打倒美帝国主义！
    英雄的越南人民万岁！
