The weather has gradually entered the peak of summer. The workers in the high-temperature workshops of various factories in Shanghai are still full of spirit and striving to better complete the production plan. Under these circumstances, many factory cadres, following the teachings of Chairman Mao in his article "Care for the Masses' Livelihood, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," pay even more attention to the masses when their enthusiasm is at its peak. Some cadres go to the high-temperature workshops to work alongside the workers and provide them with refreshing drinks. Others streamline meetings to give workers more time to rest. Some even vacate their own offices for workers to use as rest areas.

The cadres of the Shanghai Iron Pot Factory have vacated four offices with good ventilation conditions to serve as rest rooms for the workers. They have also extended their concern for the workers to their homes. They visited over 130 worker households, understanding the workers' living conditions, and reporting the factory's production situation to their families so that they can better take care of their loved ones in their daily lives. They also assisted female workers with household chores. The cadres of the Shanghai Smelting Plant have donated some electric fans from their offices to the production frontlines and have vacated a meeting room for high-temperature workshop workers to use as a dormitory. They have also strengthened the propaganda and education of anti-heat knowledge to raise workers' awareness of heat prevention.

　  上海工厂广大干部
    主动关心职工夏季生活
    气候已逐渐进入盛夏季节，上海各工厂高温车间的广大职工，依然意气风发，力争更好地完成生产计划。在这种情况下，许多工厂干部根据毛主席在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》一文中的教导，在群众干劲越足的时候，越加关心群众。他们有的到高温车间和工人一起参加劳动，给工人送清凉饮料；有的精简会议，使工人有较多的时间休息；有的腾出自己的办公室，给工人休息。上海铁锅厂的干部把通风条件好的四间办公室腾出来作为工人休息室，并把关心人的工作做到工人家里去。他们访问了一百三十多户职工家庭，了解工人的居住条件，向他们的亲人宣传厂里的生产情况，使他们能在生活上更好地照顾亲人；他们还协助有家务牵连的女职工安排了家务。上海冶炼厂干部把一部分办公室用的电风扇主动支援生产第一线，并且把一个会议室让出来，给高温车间工人当宿舍。他们还加强防暑知识的宣传教育，提高职工对防暑的自觉性。
