The film industry has been a stronghold dominated by the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought literary and artistic black line. During every major class struggle, those anti-party "heroes" in the film industry always jump out, take the lead, and charge ahead. During 1961 and 1962, when the domestic and international class enemies launched another wave of frenzied attacks, Qu Baiyin, the deputy director of the Shanghai Film Bureau, hurriedly took up the orders of the black gang leaders in the literary and artistic circles, donned his armor, and threw out an article titled "A Monologue on the Issue of Film Innovation," paving the way for the counter-revolutionary forces in the literary and artistic circles to attack the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Ding Xuelei pointed out in the article "Qu Baiyin's 'Innovation Monologue' is the Counter-Revolutionary Program of the Film Industry Black Gang" that the counter-revolutionary program of the "Innovation Monologue" is not just Qu Baiyin's "monologue," but also the "choral singing" of the anti-party black gang in the film industry. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with its mighty force, sweeps away all monsters and demons. Less than a month after Comrade Ding Xuelei's article was published, the "patriarch" of the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black line in the literary and artistic circles, Zhou Yang, was already exposed. The counter-revolutionary "innovation" grand chorus of the film industry black gang was performed under Zhou Yang's direction and instructions. Zhou Yang is the chief conductor of this anti-party "choir."

How did Zhou Yang personally strike the tuning drum for the "innovation" grand chorus?

In early 1961, when a wave of anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought evil winds swept both domestically and internationally, Zhou Yang, relying on his counter-revolutionary instincts, sensed the "climate," and enthusiastically came to Shanghai to carry out a series of intense counter-revolutionary activities. On one hand, he cheered for the anti-party black play "Hai Rui's Memorial" starring Zhou Xinfan, exclaiming "Great show!" On the other hand, he extended his black hand into the film industry, rallying troops and gathering a group of bourgeois "authorities" and "experts," as well as so-called "celebrities" and "scholars" from the 1930s, to hold a so-called "Spring Festival Tea Party." Qu Baiyin was one of the honored guests. At that time, this group of monsters and demons in the film industry were eyeing the direction in the midst of the reactionary tide, stirring; but intimidated by the power of Mao Zedong Thought and the dictatorship of the proletariat, they lacked the courage to "charge into battle," and were in a state of spiritual "anguish." The "patriarch" came at the right time. At the tea party, Zhou Yang fanned the flames and boosted morale for his followers. Under the guise of "artistic creation," he fiercely attacked what he called "old sayings," claiming that "art is called creation because it has creativity. If you repeat what others have said, it is not creation." He also issued a counter-revolutionary call with a threatening tone: "Eliminate old sayings!" The "patriarch's" counter-revolutionary speech set the tone for the anti-party, anti-socialist grand chorus of the monsters and demons in the film industry, pointing out the direction for their frenzied attack on Mao Zedong Thought. No wonder Qu Baiyin and his ilk were overjoyed, repeatedly praising: "Well said, well said, it hit the mark!"

Zhou Yang's so-called "eliminate old sayings" was further clarified in another seminar. He gritted his teeth and cursed: "To always talk about Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is also infuriating." What a vicious counter-revolutionary! It turns out that his "eliminate old sayings" was to "eliminate" Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought! His target of attack was the great Mao Zedong Thought. Here, he took on the posture of a "chief conductor," raising the counter-revolutionary black flag of "eliminate old sayings," ordering the monsters and demons to launch so-called "innovation" activities to restore capitalism.

With the "patriarch" having issued the order to "eliminate old sayings," how could the "old man" of the film industry, Xia Yan, fall behind? In October of the same year, Xia Yan quickly wrote an article to spread the "patriarch's" edict, advocating that "works must have novelty, novelty, that is, things that others have not written about, new themes, new characters, new structures, new forms, and even new moods."

"Talking about old sayings that others have said many times is not called creation." He openly issued a counter-revolutionary challenge.

With the propaganda preparation of 1961 and the gathering of a group of followers, by 1962, they thought the conditions were ripe. This year was the 20th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." In their eyes, this was a great opportunity to attack under the cover of a "red flag." After careful planning, they used the pretext of writing articles to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the "Talks" to gather a large number of people from all over the country to Beijing. Qu Baiyin was again a guest. This time, Zhou Yang personally directed and gave instructions, setting the anti-party tone. Under the direct leadership of Chen Huangmo and others, they repeatedly conspired, carefully structured, and took several months to finally have Qu Baiyin write and throw out the "Innovation Monologue." They raised the black flag of "eliminate old sayings," stirred up a "innovation" evil wind, and proposed a counter-revolutionary program that crazily opposed Mao Zedong Thought and the dictatorship of the proletariat, arrogantly shouting to "risk a little failure" for the "innovation" of the 1930s, capitalism, and revisionism, and inciting counter-revolutionary revisionists to "charge into battle."

After the "Innovation Monologue" was written, Xia Yan personally made revisions and wrote a letter to Qu Baiyin to boost morale: "The article is very good, quite novel." Soon, the "Innovation Monologue" was published in "Film Art." Zhou Yang's gang of counter-revolutionary "innovation" grand chorus officially began. "Film Art" also wrote in great detail to hype up this "grand chorus." Qu Baiyin was also proud and held a series of seminars in Shanghai to expand the reactionary influence of the "innovation" chorus. He boasted: "This article cannot be considered as written by just one person. We have already held several seminars in Beijing.... I always feel that my vision in the past was really narrow." How arrogant and foolish these counter-revolutionary revisionists were!

It was like this, with the "patriarch" Zhou Yang as the chief conductor and the "old man" Xia Yan personally in charge, this group of counter-revolutionary black gang in the film industry launched a frenzied attack on the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought.

Let's see how Qu Baiyin's "Innovation Monologue" followed the "patriarch's" baton and tuning drum, making noise and parroting, beating the same rhythm, and singing the same tune.

Qu Baiyin said: "Art must seek novelty. This is why Han Changli repeatedly admonished to eliminate old sayings!" He also said: "Creation must 'eliminate old sayings,' to see what others have not seen and say what others have not said." This is the tune set by the "patriarch" Zhou Yang. Zhou Yang had said at the Shanghai Film Bureau Spring Festival Tea Party: "Han Yu said: 'Eliminate old sayings.' Creation is to talk about what others have not talked about and express what others have not expressed." What "eliminate old sayings"?! It is to "eliminate" Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. What "see what others have not seen and say what others have not said," "talk about what others have not talked about and express what others have not expressed"?! It is to shamelessly propagate bourgeois and revisionist thoughts. Here, they blatantly used their crazy efforts to oppose Mao Zedong Thought.

Qu Baiyin said: "To break the 'three gods,' first break the 'god of themes.'" He also shouted: "Once the theme is highlighted, it will 'strip the image bare,' and will 'exclude all profound and far-reaching works.'" In fact, this is also Zhou Yang's edict. As early as 1959, at a seminar, Zhou Yang had said: "Don't start writing with a theme, don't start thinking about what strategic thought to write about." He also said: "You want to express what military thought, 'intention' is there, that is to forget 'form'." Qu Baiyin was following Zhou Yang's baton, using the pretext of breaking the theme to exclude works that express revolutionary struggles and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. They were not really against "themes." They were against Mao Zedong Thought. They wanted individualism, humanism, and the bourgeois, revisionist thoughts of "liberty, equality, fraternity."

Qu Baiyin said: "To create 'new images.'" He also said: "Heroic figures are not always chest out, belly in, eyes wide open; villains are not always rat-eyed, deer-headed, fangs bared, and teeth gritted;..." These words are also in Zhou Yang's tone. Zhou Yang had said: "Literary and artistic works should express 'new characters,' 'new thoughts,' and now literary and artistic works 'make people simpler: good guys and bad guys, as soon as they appear on stage, they are recognized.'" The "new images" they want to create are like the image of Zhang Lingfu in "Red Sun," who built monuments for the Kuomintang reactionaries, like the image of Zhu Chunhua in "Stage Sisters," who propagated the bourgeois path of individual struggle, and like the image of Wang Lide in "Ball Fan," who degraded workers into "hoodlums." They wanted to use these so-called "new images" to smear the faces of the working people and oppose our socialist literature and art in vigorously creating heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Qu Baiyin shouted: "Now, the 'wings of imagination' of artists have been 'restrained,' 'injured,' and 'broken.'" He attacked the Party for not understanding the "laws of creation," resulting in "less, slower, worse, and more expensive." These words were also bought from Zhou Yang. Zhou Yang had said: "The dogmatism in today's literature and art... has shackled the hands and feet of writers and artists." He also attacked: "The simple and brutal attitude towards literary and artistic work, however, has seriously shackled the creative freedom of writers and artists..." He also attacked: "The leadership of film script creation..." "is forced marriage, with a deadline to have children." They used the excuse of "laws of creation" to desperately demand the "creative freedom" to restore capitalism from the Party, oppose the Party's leadership of the literary and artistic cause, oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, and attempt to realize their long-planned "briefcase company," "one-person leadership in the film crew," and other conspiracies.

In the "Innovation Monologue," Qu Baiyin enthusiastically praised the so-called films of the 1930s as a "time of vigorous innovation," and did not allow "kicking over all the achievements of the past." Zhou Yang had long prepared a big hat, saying: "If 'cutting off history' and 'denying tradition,' it is actually a manifestation of sectarian thought." They praised the literary and artistic line of the 1930s as the "line of the proletariat," wanting to restore their "tradition" in the 1960s, and attempted to use this to "correct" today's socialist literature and art, brazenly using their literary and artistic black line of the 1930s to seize our politics, and drag our film industry back to the old road of capitalism....

Look, the "Innovation Monologue" became the strongest note of Zhou Yang's anti-party grand chorus. Qu Baiyin followed Zhou Yang's baton so closely, playing the shameful role of a trumpeter in attacking the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought!

The counter-revolutionary restoration plot of the film industry black gang not only has theory but also action, is a purposeful, programmatic, planned, and organized counter-revolutionary action. In recent years, under the direction of the "patriarch" Zhou Yang, they not only conspired to throw out the "Innovation Monologue" as a counter-revolutionary political and literary and artistic program, but also according to the "patriarch's" instructions, shot a large number of anti-party, anti-socialist bad films. Such as "North of the Yangtze River," "City That Never Sleeps," "Red Sun," "Ball Fan," "Axioma," "Stage Sisters," etc., were all released during the period when the "Innovation Monologue" was thrown out. These weeds spread a large amount of bourgeois and revisionist poison, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. This account must be thoroughly settled!

Now, it is clear that the "Innovation Monologue" is the counter-revolutionary action program vigorously promoted by the anti-party black gang led by Zhou Yang, a tool to implement the bourgeois, that is, the revisionist literary and artistic line in the film industry, serving the "peaceful evolution" restoration activities. These counter-revolutionary revisionists used the excuse of "innovation" to crazily attack Mao Zedong Thought, attack Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and attempted to replace the proletarian literary and artistic line with the bourgeois literary and artistic line of the 1930s; to replace the Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic program with the revisionist counter-revolutionary literary and artistic program. However, all this is in vain. The small clique led by Zhou Yang wants to oppose Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line, like a mad dog barking at the sun, it does not harm the brilliance of the great Mao Zedong Thought. On the contrary, it exposes their own counter-revolutionary ugly faces, exposing the anti-party, anti-socialist reactionary nature of the "Innovation Monologue." Zhou Yang, the leader of the anti-party black gang in the literary and artistic circles, has long directed this anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought literary and artistic black line from top to bottom, but disguised himself as the "only correct" "authority," waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. Now, the disguise is torn off, the conspiracy is exposed, and it turns out that Zhou Yang is the root of the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black line in the literary and artistic circles. Zhou Yang, this counter-revolutionary revisionist, is a complete two-faced person.

A large number of facts that have been exposed show that since liberation, all the bad things in our literary and artistic circles have almost all come from Zhou Yang, this "patriarch" of revisionist literature and art. In the fierce class struggle on the literary and artistic front, Zhou Yang has become the "big backer" who shelters all monsters and demons. On the literary and artistic battlefield occupied by Zhou Yang and his anti-party clique, monsters and demons are rampant, and bourgeois dictatorship has already been implemented. Now, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals have taken action. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, they actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, verbally and in writing, open fire on the anti-party, anti-socialist black line, and expose the cover of the anti-party black gang that has ruled the literary and artistic circles for sixteen years, pulling out one monster and demon after another. We must pursue victory, thoroughly smash this counter-revolutionary nest, destroy this counter-revolutionary "choir," and thoroughly overthrow the chief conductor of this "choir." We must raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought high and let it fly forever on the film battlefield!

    周扬是反革命黑帮“创新”合唱的总指挥
    解集文
    电影界是被反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想文艺黑线统治的顽固堡垒。每一次大规模的阶级斗争风浪中，电影界那些反党的“英雄好汉”总是要跳出来，充先锋，打头阵。一九六一、六二年间，当国内外阶级敌人又一次发起猖狂进攻的时候，上海市电影局副局长瞿白音，就急急忙忙秉承文艺界黑帮头目的旨意，披挂上阵，抛出了一篇《关于电影创新问题的独白》，为文艺界反革命势力向党、向社会主义、向毛泽东思想进攻鸣锣开道。
    丁学雷同志在《瞿白音的〈创新独白〉是电影界黑帮的反革命纲领》一文中，一针见血地指出：《创新独白》这个反革命纲领，不只是瞿白音一个人的“独白”，而且是电影界反党黑帮的“合唱”。无产阶级文化大革命以雷霆万钧之势，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。丁学雷同志这篇文章发表后不到一个月，文艺界反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑线的“祖师爷”周扬已被揪了出来。电影界黑帮这个反革命的“创新”大合唱，正是在周扬的指挥、授意下演出的。周扬就是这个反党“合唱队”的总指挥。
    “创新”大合唱的定音鼓，是怎样由周扬亲自敲响的呢？
    一九六一年初，在国内外掀起一股反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的妖风时，周扬凭着他的反革命嗅觉，看准了“气候”，兴致勃勃地来到上海，进行了一系列紧张的反革命活动。他一面为周信芳主演的反党黑戏《海瑞上疏》助威，连呼“好戏！”一面又把黑手伸向电影界，呼兵唤将，召集电影界的一批资产阶级“权威”“专家”，和所谓三十年代的“名人”“学士”，举行所谓“春节茶话会”。瞿白音就是座上“贵客”。当时，电影界这批牛鬼蛇神，在那股反动逆流中，正在窥测方向，蠢蠢欲动；但慑于毛泽东思想和无产阶级专政的威力，还缺乏“冲锋陷阵”的勇气，处于精神“苦闷”之中。“祖师爷”来得正是时候。在茶话会上，周扬大肆煽风点火，为他的娄罗们鼓劲打气。他借“艺术创作”之名，疯狂攻击所谓“陈言”，说什么“艺术所以叫创作，就因为有创造性。别人讲过的东西，你再来重复，就不是创作。”并且声势汹汹地发出了反革命号召：“唯陈言之务去”！“祖师爷”这一番反党黑话，为电影界牛鬼蛇神反党反社会主义的大合唱，定下了基调，指明了向毛泽东思想猖狂进攻的方向。怪不得瞿白音之流听得心花怒放，连声称赞：“讲得好，讲得好，讲到我们心里了！”
    周扬在那次茶话会上叫嚷的所谓“去陈言”，在以后另一次座谈会上，做了最明确的注解。他咬牙切齿地骂道：“言必称马列主义，言必称毛泽东思想，也是够叫人恼火的了。”好一副反党狂徒的凶相！原来，他所说的“去陈言”，就是“去”马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想！他攻击的矛头，就是指向伟大的毛泽东思想。他在这里摆出一副“总指挥”的架势，祭起“去陈言”的反革命黑旗，下令要牛鬼蛇神展开所谓“创新”的复辟资本主义的活动。
    “祖师爷”既已发出“去陈言”之令，电影界“老头子”夏衍岂敢落后？！同年十月，夏衍连忙写了一篇文章，传布“祖师爷”的旨意，鼓吹“作品一定要有新意，新意，就是别人不曾写过的东西，新的主题、新的性格、新的结构、新的造型，乃至新的意境等等。”
  “讲别人讲过多少遍的陈言，是不能称为创作的。”公开下了反革命挑战书。
    有了一九六一年的一番舆论准备，又物色了一批娄罗打手，到一九六二年，他们以为条件已经成熟了。这一年，正是毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十周年。在他们看来，这是一个打着“红旗”反红旗的大好时机。他们经过精心策划，借着写“纪念”《讲话》发表二十周年的文章为名，从全国调集了一大批人到北京，瞿白音又是座上客。这一次，由周扬直接指挥，面授机宜，定下了反党的基调。在陈荒煤等人直接主持之下，反复密谋，精心结构，历几个月之久，最后由瞿白音执笔，抛出了《创新独白》。他们高举“去陈言”的黑旗，刮起一股“创新”的妖风，提出了一个疯狂反对毛泽东思想、反对无产阶级专政的反革命纲领，狂妄地叫喊要为“创”三十年代、资本主义、修正主义之“新”而“冒一点失败的危险”，煽动反革命修正主义分子“冲锋陷阵”。
    《创新独白》写好之后，夏衍亲笔加以修改，并写信给瞿白音打气：“文章很好，颇有新意”。不久，《创新独白》就在《电影艺术》上发表。周扬一伙反革命
  “创新”大合唱从此正式开场了。《电影艺术》还连篇累牍地为这个“大合唱”大肆捧场。瞿白音也得意洋洋地在上海连续召开座谈会，为“创新”合唱扩大反动影响。他踌躇满志地说：“这篇文章不能算我一个人写的，我们在北京已开了好几个座谈会。……我总觉得自己在过去，眼光实在太窄了。”这一伙反革命修正主义分子是何等趾高气扬，利令智昏啊！
    就是这样，由“祖师爷”周扬担任总指挥，由“老头子”夏衍亲自掌握，电影界这一伙反革命黑帮向党向社会主义向毛泽东思想发动了一场猖狂的大进攻。
    让我们来看一看，瞿白音的《创新独白》，是如何跟着“祖师爷”的指挥棒和定音鼓，鼓噪学舌，打一个节拍，唱一个调门的。
    瞿白音说：“艺术则必须求新。这就是为什么韩昌黎要谆谆以去陈言为诫吧！”还说：创作要“去陈言”，要“见人之所未见，言人之所未言”。这正是“祖师爷”周扬定的调。周扬在上海电影局春节茶话会上就说过：“韩愈说：‘唯陈言之务去’。创作就是要讲人家没有讲过的，表现人家没有表现过的。”什么“去陈言”？！就是“去”马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。什么“见人之所未见，言人之所未言”，“讲人家没有讲过的，表现人家没有表现过的”？！就是要肆无忌惮地宣扬资产阶级、修正主义思想。他们在这里赤裸裸地使出了反对毛泽东思想的疯狂劲。
    瞿白音说：要破“三神”，首先要破“主题之神”。还叫嚣：主题一突出，就要“把形象剥得精光”，就会
  “排斥一切义深意远的作品”。其实，这也是周扬的旨意。早在一九五九年一次座谈会上，周扬就说过：“不要一写就搞一个主题思想，不要开始写就想到要写一个什么战略思想。”又说：“你要表现什么军事思想，
  ‘意’是有一个，就是忘‘形’”。瞿白音正是跟着周扬的指挥棒，借破主题为名，来排斥作品表现革命斗争、宣扬毛泽东思想的主题。他们并不是真的不要“主题思想”。他们反对的只是毛泽东思想。他们要的是个人主义、人道主义、“自由、平等、博爱”的资产阶级、修正主义思想。
    瞿白音说：要塑造“新的形象”。还说：“英雄人物并非都随时随地挺胸凸肚、怒目圆睁；奸恶之徒也并非都鼠目獐头、呲牙咧嘴；……”这些话，也正是周扬的腔调。周扬说过：文艺作品要表现“新的人物”，“新的思想”，现在的文艺作品“使人民变得比较简单了：好人坏人，一出场马上就给人认出来。”他们要塑造的“新的形象”，就是《红日》里为国民党反动派树碑立传的张灵甫那样的形象，就是《舞台姐妹》里宣扬资产阶级个人奋斗道路的竺春花那样的形象，就是《球迷》里把工人丑化成“阿飞”一样的王立德那样的形象。他们就是要以这些所谓“新的形象”，来在劳动人民脸上抹黑，反对我们社会主义文艺去大力塑造工农兵的英雄形象。
    瞿白音大叫大嚷说：现在，艺术家的“想象的翅膀”被“束缚”了，被“挫伤”了，被“折断”了。攻击党不懂“创作规律”，造成了“少慢差费”。这些话，也是从周扬那里批发来的。周扬就说过：“我们今天的文学艺术上的教条主义……束缚了作家、艺术家的手足。”“对文艺工作的简单化的、粗暴的态度，却严重地束缚了作家、艺术家的创作自由……”还攻击说：“对电影剧本创作的领导，……”“是强迫结婚，限期生孩子”。他们借“创作规律”为借口，拚命向党要复辟资本主义的“创作自由”，反对党对文学艺术事业的领导，反对无产阶级专政，妄图实现他们蓄谋已久的“皮包公司”、“导演在摄制组的一元化领导”等阴谋。
    瞿白音在《创新独白》中，狂热地吹捧所谓三十年代电影，是“蓬勃创新的时代”，不准“一脚踢翻前人一切成就”。周扬则早就准备了一顶大帽子，说：如果“割断历史，否定传统，实际上是宗派主义思想的一种表现。”他们把三十年代文艺路线吹捧为“无产阶级的路线”，要在六十年代恢复他们的“传统”，妄想以此来“改正”今天的社会主义文艺，明目张胆地用他们的三十年代文艺黑线来专我们的政，把我们的电影事业拖回到资本主义老路上去。……
    看，《创新独白》就是这样成为周扬指挥的反党大合唱的最强音。瞿白音就是这样紧紧跟着周扬的指挥棒，扮演了向党向社会主义向毛泽东思想进攻的可耻的吹鼓手！
    电影界反革命黑帮的复辟阴谋，不仅有理论，而且有行动，是有目的、有纲领、有计划、有组织的反革命行动。几年来，他们在“祖师爷”周扬的指挥下，不仅合谋抛出了《创新独白》这个反革命政治纲领和文艺纲领，而且按照“祖师爷”的指示，拍摄了大量反党反社会主义的坏电影。象上海摄制的《北国江南》、《不夜城》、《红日》、《球迷》、《阿诗玛》、《舞台姐妹》等等，都是在抛出《创新独白》这一期间先后出笼的。这些毒草，散布了大量的资产阶级、修正主义的毒素，为资本主义复辟大造舆论。这一笔账，必须彻底清算！
    现在，已经看得很清楚，《创新独白》是以周扬为首的反党黑帮竭力推行的反革命行动纲领，是在电影界贯彻资产阶级的即修正主义文艺路线，为“和平演变”的复辟活动效劳的工具。这些反革命修正主义分子借“创新”为名，疯狂地攻击毛泽东思想，攻击毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，妄图以三十年代资产阶级文艺路线，取代无产阶级文艺路线；以修正主义反革命文艺纲领，偷换马克思列宁主义文艺纲领。然而，这一切都是徒劳的，以周扬为首的一小撮黑帮，要反对毛泽东思想、反对毛泽东文艺路线，如狂犬吠日，无损于伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。相反地，倒暴露了他们自己的反革命丑恶嘴脸，暴露了《创新独白》反党反社会主义的反动本质。周扬这个文艺界反党黑帮的头子，长期来从上到下指挥着这条反党反社会主义的文艺黑线，却又把自己装扮成“唯一正确”的“权威”，扛着“红旗”反红旗。如今，伪装剥去了，阴谋拆穿了，原来周扬是文艺界反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想黑线的根子，周扬这个反革命修正主义分子是个十足的两面派。
    已经揭露出来的大量事实表明，解放以来，我国文艺界的一切坏东西，几乎都来源于周扬这个修正主义文艺的“祖师爷”。在文艺战线上激烈的阶级斗争中，周扬成了包庇一切牛鬼蛇神的“大靠山”。在周扬一伙反党分子霸占的文艺阵地上，牛鬼蛇神张牙舞爪，已经实行了资产阶级专政。现在，广大的工农兵群众和革命知识分子已经行动起来了，他们在毛主席和党中央的领导下，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，口诛笔伐，向反党反社会主义黑线开火，揭开了十六年来统治文艺界的反党黑帮的盖子，把一个个牛鬼蛇神揪出来了。我们要乘胜追击，彻底摧毁这个反革命的老巢，捣烂这个反革命的“合唱队”，彻底打倒这个“合唱队”的总指挥。我们一定要在电影阵地上，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高高升起，永远飘扬！
