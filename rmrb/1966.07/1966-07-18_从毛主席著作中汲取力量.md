Our company's comrades all affectionately call Liu Yingjun "the locomotive."

In October 1964, the troops were sent to the farm to rush-harvest soybeans. After hearing the mobilization speech, Liu Yingjun immediately started repairing his carrying pole and straps. He was afraid his carrying pole couldn't withstand the load, so he bound a wooden plank on top, preparing to work hard.

During the rush-harvest, he packed the soybeans so full that they looked like two small mountains. When he ran, he was faster than anyone else. Some comrades said, "Liu Yingjun is really like a locomotive!" From then on, the name "locomotive" was passed around among the comrades.

One day, after lunch, the comrades were resting in the field. Liu Yingjun took out "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" from his pocket and began to read intently. Seeing him sweating all over, I said, "Rest a bit, then read when you go back!" He replied, "Precisely because I'm tired, it's necessary to draw strength from Chairman Mao's works! Otherwise, I'll have no energy."

Hearing his words, I was deeply moved. It turned out that his enthusiasm came from drawing strength from Chairman Mao's works!

　　从毛主席著作中汲取力量
　　班长　张忠祥
    我们连的同志，都爱管刘英俊同志叫“火车头”。
    一九六四年十月，部队到农场抢收黄豆。刘英俊同志听了动员报告，马上动手修理扁担、夹子。他怕自己的扁担经不住压，又在上面绑了一根板条，做好了苦干的准备。
    抢收当中，他把豆子装得满满的，挑起来象两座小山，跑起来比谁都快。有的同志说：“刘英俊真象个火车头！”从此，“火车头”的名字就被同志们传开了。
    一天，午饭后，同志们正在地头休息。刘英俊从兜里掏出《毛泽东著作选读》，聚精会神地读了起来。我看他累得浑身是汗，就说：“你休息一会，回去再读吧！”他说：“正因为累，才有必要从毛主席著作中汲取力量呢！不然就没劲了。”
    我听了他的话，心里很受感动。原来，他干劲这么足，正是从毛主席著作中汲取的力量啊！
