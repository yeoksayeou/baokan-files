The great era of Chairman Mao is an era of heroes. In the Shenyang Military Region, a hero like Ouyang Hai has emerged, a great communist warrior in the style of Lei Feng and Wang Jie. His name is Liu Yingjun. He sacrificed his life to protect the safety of the people. People enthusiastically praise him as "a good soldier educated by Chairman Mao."

In the summer of 1962, when the Kuomintang bandits were raving mad about invading the mainland, Liu Yingjun, the son of a poor peasant, eagerly enlisted in the army. At that time, someone said, "You are only seventeen years old and an only child. Your conditions are not sufficient." He replied, "But my determination is sufficient. For the sake of the motherland and the people, even if I sacrifice my life, I will feel proud and honored, and happy and fortunate."

Comrade Liu Yingjun harbors the deepest class sentiments for the great leader Chairman Mao. He hung four portraits of Chairman Mao around his dormitory. Whenever he moved to a new place, he would first hang up the portraits of Chairman Mao; whenever he returned from duty, he would first stand in front of the portraits of Chairman Mao and gaze at them with deep emotion. He said, "Chairman Mao is the North Star of the Chinese people and also the North Star of the people of the world."

When Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng," Comrade Liu Yingjun enthusiastically responded. He wrote Chairman Mao's call in his notebook, on the walls, on the handles of his tools, and engraved it in his heart, putting it into action. He was determined to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and become a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

Comrade Liu Yingjun insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works according to the principles proposed by Comrade Lin Biao: "Study with problems in mind, apply actively, integrate study and use, learn urgently what is needed urgently, and see immediate results." Sometimes, after standing guard late at night, he would still read a passage from Chairman Mao's works and write a reflection. He said, "It is Mao Zedong Thought that has shown me the way forward."

Comrade Liu Yingjun repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, clearly establishing a class struggle perspective. During a socialist education campaign, he listened to a report by local cadres and realized that class enemies had placed their hopes for counter-revolutionary restoration on the younger generation, further enhancing his awareness of eliminating bourgeois ideology and transforming his thoughts.

Comrade Liu Yingjun practiced according to Chairman Mao's teachings and also studied Chairman Mao's teachings in practice. During a heavy and arduous labor task, Liu Yingjun seized the rest time to read Chairman Mao's works. When others advised him to rest, he said, "Precisely because I am tired, it is necessary to draw strength from Chairman Mao's works!"

In the spring of 1964, the company ordered the third platoon to repair a dilapidated room into a dormitory. This room had been used as a kitchen, a pigsty, and was dark and filthy. Many comrades said, "It's tough, it's hard to fix." Liu Yingjun also had this thought at first, but after studying Chairman Mao's works, he immediately made a self-criticism to the deputy platoon leader and suggested that the entire platoon study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" to strengthen their resolve to overcome difficulties.

In revolutionary practice, Comrade Liu Yingjun diligently and steadily transformed himself, continuously raising his proletarian consciousness. He often used holidays, rest days, and other free time to help the masses carry water, sweep the floor, carry grain, push carts, lay paths, repair wells, and so on. He did good deeds without leaving his name, reporting, or recording them in his diary.

One day, Liu Yingjun was out when it suddenly rained heavily, and the river swelled. He saw a cart loaded with cucumbers stuck in the river, so he fearlessly jumped in and rescued the old man, helping him unload the cucumbers from the cart and carry them to the shore one by one. The old man thanked him, and he said, "This is what Chairman Mao told me to learn from Lei Feng."

In the company, Liu Yingjun was known as an "eternal busybody," repairing tables and chairs, making mailboxes, organizing tools, and sealing windows. He devoted himself to the collective and to the revolution, actively doing anything beneficial to his comrades and the company. The soldiers said, "His good deeds are countless."

Through studying Chairman Mao's works and practical training, Liu Yingjun gradually established a proletarian worldview. He had in mind the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, always thinking of the oppressed people around the world. When the U.S. imperialists expanded their aggression in Vietnam, he immediately expressed his determination to the Party, ready to rush to the front lines of the anti-American struggle at any time.

Liu Yingjun insisted on the direction of emphasizing politics and resisted the influence of bourgeois military thought. In the summer of 1964, he was studying at the artillery training camp, and he formed a "red pair" with a platoon leader from his company. The platoon leader wanted him to focus on military training on Sundays, but he insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works and doing mass work on Sundays.

When the new soldier Tian An joined the third platoon, Liu Yingjun immediately formed a "red pair" with him and actively helped him read Chairman Mao's books. Tian An said, "I can't read!" Liu Yingjun said, "No problem, I'll read to you!" Liu Yingjun believed that the more people who mastered Mao Zedong Thought, the stronger the revolutionary force would be.

Once, Liu Yingjun was resting in the hospital and heard that the bookstore had received "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong." He thought, "Many comrades in the company want to buy Chairman Mao's works, this is great!" He actively bought twenty-five copies on behalf of his comrades and enthusiastically sent them back to the company, showing his greatest concern for his comrades' politics.

In organizing cultural activities in the company, Liu Yingjun insisted on the direction proposed by Chairman Mao that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve proletarian politics. He repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and proposed that the company's "small programs should have a big direction," emphasizing that everything must be done according to the spirit of Chairman Mao's "Talks."

Liu Yingjun edited programs, created wall newspapers, and drew slides, actively propagating heroes who grew up under the nurturing of great Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as Wang Jie's deeds were published, he hurriedly drew slides. The comrade on duty said with concern, "Go rest, you have a shift tomorrow!" He said, "If I don't finish it tonight, the comrades won't be able to see it tomorrow."

Liu Yingjun often worked tirelessly to carry the slide projector to a production point more than twenty miles away from the company, where only three people were stationed, to show slides. The comrades said, "We received education in Mao Zedong Thought through watching the slides."

Liu Yingjun bravely defended Mao Zedong Thought. In 1964, he wrote an article criticizing Feng Ding's so-called "theory of righteous indignation." By the end of 1964, he had already said that "The Enemy at the Gate" was a bad film that went against Mao Zedong Thought. When the "Liberation Army Daily" published Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article criticizing Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, he immediately actively organized the entire platoon to study it.

Liu Yingjun enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the masses. He regarded propagating Mao Zedong Thought as his lifelong mission. Three days before his sacrifice, he still wrote a letter to a classmate, advising her to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and firmly go to the countryside for tempering. With his help, this classmate persuaded three other classmates to join the agricultural front.

Liu Yingjun was an excellent off-campus counselor. The first time he spoke to the children, he talked about reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being a good child of Chairman Mao. He also took the children to the Revolutionary Martyrs' Monument for revolutionary tradition education, hoping that the children would inherit the legacy of the martyrs and become red successors.

On the morning of March 15 this year, on the outskirts of Jiamusi City, cars and people came and went in a continuous stream. Liu Yingjun was driving a cannon cart along this road for training. The draft horse of the cannon cart was startled by the honking of a car and rushed towards the crowd. Liu Yingjun bravely forced the frightened horse to turn onto a small path on the left side of the road, avoiding an accident.

The frightened horse continued to run wildly on the small path with ice and snow on both sides. At this moment, not far in front of the cannon cart, six children were frightened and stood still. In this critical moment, Liu Yingjun bravely risked his life to make the horse fall, saving the six children, but he was crushed by the cart and horse, sustaining severe injuries. Despite rescue efforts, he died gloriously.

Heroes love the people, and the people love heroes. To commemorate the hero, the people of Jiamusi City planted a pine tree at the place where Comrade Liu Yingjun sacrificed himself, surrounding it with a five-pointed star-shaped flower bed. Old people and children often come to water and tend to it. People passing by always look up at the pine tree with reverence, remembering the hero.

The unit where Comrade Liu Yingjun served before his death actively carried out the campaign to learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun. Cadres and soldiers unanimously expressed their determination to learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun, to study the supreme directives diligently, to execute the supreme directives faithfully, to propagate the supreme directives enthusiastically, to defend the supreme directives bravely, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Great Mao Zedong Thought has fostered great revolutionary heroes. In the campaign to learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun, cadres and soldiers deeply felt that to learn from Liu Yingjun, one must, like him, first and foremost study Chairman Mao's works well; in big and small matters, one must act completely according to the supreme directives. One must follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee, never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, never forget emphasizing politics, and never forget holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought; one must forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

   最高指示的模范执行者——刘英俊
    ①　伟大的毛泽东时代，是英雄辈出的时代。在沈阳部队又出现了一个欧阳海式的英雄，雷锋、王杰式的伟大的共产主义战士。他的名字叫刘英俊。他为了保护人民生命安全，英勇地献出了生命。人们热烈地颂扬他“是毛主席教育出来的好战士”。
    ②　一九六二年夏天，蒋介石匪帮疯狂叫嚣窜犯大陆，贫农的儿子刘英俊积极报名参军。当时，有人说：“你才十七岁，又是独生子，条件不够。”他说：“可是，我的决心够。为了祖国，为了人民，哪怕牺牲了自己的生命，我也感到骄傲和自豪，光荣和幸福。”
    ③　刘英俊同志对伟大的领袖毛主席，怀有最深厚的阶级感情。他把四幅毛主席象悬挂在宿舍四周。每次搬到新地方，他总是先把毛主席象悬挂起来；每次执勤回来，他又先到毛主席象前深情地仰望。他说：“毛主席是中国人民的北斗星，也是世界人民的北斗星。”
    ④　毛主席发出“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召，刘英俊同志热烈响应。他把毛主席的号召记在本子上，写在墙壁上，刻在锄柄上，印在心坎上，落在行动上。他决心象雷锋那样读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
    ⑤　刘英俊同志坚持按照林彪同志提出的“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”的原则，努力学习毛主席著作。有时候，他深更半夜站哨回来，还要读一段毛主席著作，写一篇心得笔记。他说，“是毛泽东思想给我指明了前进的道路。”
    ⑥　刘英俊同志反复学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，明确地树立了阶级斗争观点。在一次社会主义教育中，他听了地方干部的报告，认识到阶级敌人把反革命复辟的希望寄托在年青一代的身上，更加提高了兴无灭资、改造思想的自觉性。
    ⑦　刘英俊同志按照毛主席的教导去实践，又在实践中学习毛主席的教导。在一次繁重艰苦的劳动中，刘英俊同志抓紧休息时间阅读毛主席著作。别人劝他休息，他说：“正因为累，才有必要从毛主席著作中汲取力量呢！”
    ⑧　一九六四年春天，连里要三班把一间破房子修成宿舍。这间房，作过伙房，当过猪圈，又黑又胜，不少同志都说：够呛，难修。刘英俊同志开始也有这个想法，可是他学习了毛主席著作，马上向副班长作了检讨，并建议全班学习《愚公移山》，增强了战胜困难的决心。
    ⑨　在革命实践中，刘英俊同志踏踏实实、点点滴滴地改造自己，不断提高无产阶级觉悟。他经常利用节日、假日等休息时间，去为群众挑水、扫地、背粮、推车、垫路、修井……。他做好事从来都是不留名、不汇报，也不在日记里记载。
    ⑩　有一天，刘英俊同志外出正赶上天下大雨，河涨大水。他看见一辆装满西葫芦的牛车陷在河里，就不顾水深流急，立刻跳下去奋力援救，帮助老大爷把车上的西葫芦卸下来，一趟一趟地运到岸上。老大爷向他道谢，他说：“这是毛主席叫我向雷锋学的。”
    ?在连队里，刘英俊同志是个“老不闲”，修桌椅、做信箱、整工具、堵窗洞……。他一心为集体，一心为革命，只要是对同志、对连队有益的事，就主动去做。战士们说：“他做的好事是无法用数字计算的。”
    ?刘英俊同志通过学习毛主席著作和实践锻炼，逐步树立了无产阶级世界观。他胸怀中国革命和世界革命，时刻想着世界上一切受压迫的人民。当美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的时候，他立刻向党表示决心，随时准备奔赴反美斗争的最前线。
    ?刘英俊同念坚持突出政治的方向，抵制资产阶级军事思想的影响。一九六四年夏天，他在炮兵集训队学习，和同来的本连一位班长结成“一对红”。班长要他星期天突击军事，他一直坚持星期天学习毛主席著作和做群众工作。
    ?新战士段天安一到三班，刘英俊就和他结成“一对红”的对子，积极地帮助他读毛主席的书。段天安说：“我不识字呀！”刘英俊说：“没关系，我念你听！”刘英俊认为，多一个人掌握毛泽东思想，就多一分革命的力量。
    ?有一次，刘英俊同志正在医院休养，听说书店来了《毛泽东著作选读》，他想：连队有很多同志想买毛主席著作，这回可好啦！他主动为同志们代买了二十五本，热情地送回连队，表现了对同志政治上的最大关心。
    ?刘英俊同志在连队开展文娱活动中，坚持毛主席提出的文艺为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的方向。他反复学习毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，提出连队的“小节目要有大方向”，强调一定按照毛主席的《讲话》精神办事。
    ?刘英俊同志编节目、出墙报、画幻灯片，积极地宣传在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的英雄人物。王杰的事迹一发表，他就赶画幻灯片。带哨的同志关心地说：“快休息吧，天亮还有你一班岗呢！”他说：“今晚不赶出来，明天同志们就看不上了。”
    ?刘英俊同志为了让连队每个同志都看到幻灯，常常不辞劳苦地背起幻灯机，到远离连队二十多里、只有三个人的生产点去放映。同志们说：我们通过看幻灯，受到了毛泽东思想的教育。
    ?刘英俊同志勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想。一九六四年他写文章严斥冯定的所谓“正义冲动论”一九六四年底，他就说过《兵临城下》是一部违背毛泽东思想的坏电影。《解放军报》发表了姚文元同志批判吴晗反党反社会主义的罪行的文章，他立即主动地组织全班学习。
    ?刘英俊同志满腔热忱地向群众宣传毛泽东思想。他把宣传毛泽东思想当作了毕生的战斗任务。在他牺牲前三天，还写信给一个同学，劝她按毛主席的教导，坚定地到农村去锻炼。这个同学在他的帮助下，又动员三个同学一齐走上了农业战线。
    ?刘英俊同志是一位优秀的校外辅导员。他第一次给小朋友们讲话，就讲读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好孩子。他还把小朋友们带到革命烈士塔前，进行革命传统教育，希望孩子们继承先烈遗志，做一个红色接班人。
    ?今年三月十五日早晨，在佳木斯市郊公路上，车来人往，川流不息。刘英俊同志赶着炮车，沿着这条公路出去训练。炮车的辕马被汽车喇叭声吓惊了，向人群冲去。刘英俊同志冒着危险，迫使惊马拐上了公路左侧的小道，避免了一场事故。
    ?惊马继续在两旁堆着冰雪的小道上飞跑。这时，在炮车前面不远的地方，有六个小孩子被吓呆了。刘英俊同志在这千钧一发的时刻，冒着极大的危险把马弄倒，六名儿童安然脱险，他却被车马压倒，身负重伤，经抢救无效，光荣牺牲了。
    ?英雄爱人民，人民爱英雄。为了纪念英雄，佳木斯市人民在刘英俊同志英勇献身的地点植上了一株青松，周围建成了五角星形的花坛，老人、孩子常来培土浇水。人们经过这里，都用崇敬的目光，仰望青松，怀念英雄。
    ?刘英俊同志生前所在部队大力开展向刘英俊同志学习的活动。干部战士一致表示，要象刘英俊同志那样，努力地学习最高指示，忠实地执行最高指示，热情地宣传最高指示，勇敢地捍卫最高指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    ?伟大的毛泽东思想，造就伟大的革命英雄。在开展向刘英俊同志学习的活动中，广大干部战士深刻体会到：学习刘英俊，就要象他那样，千好，万好，首先要把毛主席著作学习好；大事，小事，完全要按照最高指示办事。一定要遵照党中央的指示，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗；要永远地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。 （王文里、张世祥、李奎根、陈家栋绘）（本版转载《解放军报》）
