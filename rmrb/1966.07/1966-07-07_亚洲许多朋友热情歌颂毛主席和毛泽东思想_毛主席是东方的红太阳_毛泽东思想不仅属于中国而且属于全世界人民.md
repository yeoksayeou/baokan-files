Many friends in Asia have warmly praised Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They say, "Chairman Mao is the red sun of the East," "Mao Zedong Thought is the truth, a beacon illuminating the world's revolutionary people," "Mao Zedong Thought belongs not only to China but to all the people of the world," "Mao Zedong is a great leader of tremendous historical significance."

The Lao, Japanese, and Ceylonese delegations and individuals who have visited China, as well as friends from Palestine and Kashmir, have expressed their boundless enthusiasm for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They say: "Chairman Mao is like the red sun of the East," "Mao Zedong Thought is the truth, a beacon illuminating the world's revolutionary people," "Mao Zedong Thought belongs not only to China but to all the people of the world," "Mao Zedong is a great leader of tremendous historical significance."

Recently, the head of the Lao Civil Servants Delegation, K. Banmalay, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "Chairman Mao is like the red sun of the East. Seeing Chairman Mao is like seeing the red sun. The Lao people love Chairman Mao more than their own parents. Parents only give us life, but Mao Zedong Thought liberates us from imperialist oppression and slavery, giving us new life. Chairman Mao is our savior."

He said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the truth, a beacon illuminating the world's revolutionary people. Mao Zedong Thought has deeply rooted itself in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, especially in the hearts of the oppressed and exploited people." He said: "Now, all the people of the world, especially the revolutionary people, are looking towards the East, towards China. Because China has Mao Zedong."

K. Banmalay emphasized the great initiative of studying Chairman Mao's works and applying Mao Zedong Thought in China. He said: "In China, from cities to villages, from factories to communes, everyone studies Chairman Mao's works and applies Mao Zedong Thought. When they encounter difficulties, they study Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome them." He said: "The Chinese people, by applying Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved great successes in socialist construction."

He said: "The Lao people, like the Chinese people, love Chairman Mao and study Mao Zedong's works." "In more than twenty years of anti-imperialist struggle, whether in intense battles or in lulls between battles, the Lao people and soldiers have persisted in studying Mao Zedong Thought. The Lao people have been able to shoot down so many American planes and repel enemy attacks because of applying Mao Zedong Thought."

K. Banmalay also enthusiastically shared his thoughts after visiting the Chinese revolutionary base area of Jinggangshan with the reporter. He said: "Jinggangshan sets a brilliant example for the Lao people and points out a clear direction. The more I think about it, the more I love Jinggangshan, because in Jinggangshan I saw the brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao."

K. Banmalay highly praised the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said: "The workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals of China, with Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, are fighting against the anti-party, anti-socialist clique and have achieved great victories." He said: "This Cultural Revolution is correct, aimed at consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist thoughts from spreading in China, and preventing the emergence of revisionism in China, and is aimed at promoting the socialist revolution and socialist construction." He said: "This Cultural Revolution proves the thoroughness of the Chinese revolution."

K. Banmalay said: "This Cultural Revolution is to educate the younger generation of China not to forget class struggle, not to forget the past, especially to educate the Chinese youth to be the successors of the proletariat," "The Chinese Cultural Revolution is a blow to imperialism and modern revisionism."

Recently, a member of the Japanese delegation of active readers of "People's China," Kamiya Teru, said on June 30 in Kofu City, Yamanashi Prefecture, to a Chinese reporter that Mao Zedong Thought belongs not only to China but to all the people of the world. It is a great force to overthrow American imperialism and smash modern revisionism, and is a powerful philosophical weapon for the people of the world.

Kamiya said in discussing China's education situation that through this visit, he understood that China also places politics first in educating youth, using Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate revolutionary successors and people standing at the forefront of the world revolution.

Kamiya enthusiastically said that the Chinese people's study of Chairman Mao's works, mastery of Mao Zedong Thought, and use of Mao Zedong Thought to guide actions gave him great inspiration. He said that especially from the aspect of actively applying Mao Zedong's works, he gained great enlightenment in putting effort into the "use" aspect. He said that all this made him determined to truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

A representative of the Japanese Youth League, Tomioka Jun, who participated in the first Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival, said at a welcoming gathering for the Chinese Youth Delegation visiting Japan in Tokyo: Mao Zedong Chairman and Mao Zedong Thought are not only China's but also ours. He said that those who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought are fearless. He said that he was particularly interested in Chairman Mao's theories and practices of armed struggle, people's war, and opposition to modern revisionism, which are a great force inspiring the anti-American struggle of various countries' people.

A member of the Ceylon Engineering Workers Union delegation, Ceylon Engineering Workers Union leader Perera, wrote in an article in the Sinhala-language "Labor News" on June 24: Mao Zedong Thought is the development of Marxism. Its brilliance adds a new page to Marxism-Leninism.

The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Ahmed Shukeiri, said at a meeting of the Private Representatives Committee of Arab Kings and Heads of State in Cairo on June 29: "Mao Zedong is a great leader of tremendous historical significance."

He also said that we will always march forward hand in hand with the great Mao Zedong because he firmly stands on our side.

Shukeiri refuted the slander against China by Jordan's King Hussein's representative, Sad Goma, at the meeting. He said: "We are not afraid of the slander against our friendship with China and the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. On the contrary, we are proud of our friendship with China and Mao Zedong."

The director of Free Kashmir Radio, Azmi, recently told a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Muzaffarabad, the capital of the Pakistani-controlled area of Kashmir: "The Chinese people, under the leadership of their great leader Mao Zedong, have always stood on the side of the oppressed and trampled people, and this is the greatness of China."

He said that whether in the Vietnamese, Korean, or Kashmir issues, the Chinese people and their leaders have always been fearless of violence, sympathizing with and supporting the enslaved people. He said: "Because of China's consistent performance, we greatly trust China." (With photo)

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：访问过中国的老挝、日本、锡兰代表团和人士以及巴勒斯坦和克什米尔朋友，以无比的热情歌颂毛主席和毛泽东思想。他们说：“毛主席象东方的红太阳”，“毛泽东思想是真理，是照耀世界人民革命的灯塔”，“毛泽东思想不仅属于中国，而且属于世界人民”，“毛泽东是具有巨大历史意义的伟大领袖”。
    老挝公务员代表团团长盖·班马莱通最近对新华社记者说：“毛主席象东方的红太阳。我们见到了毛主席，就好象见到了红太阳。我们老挝人民热爱毛主席胜过爱自己的亲生父母。亲生父母只生了我们的身，毛泽东思想使我们从帝国主义压迫和奴役下解放出来，获得新生。毛主席是我们的救星。”
    他说：“毛泽东思想是真理，是照耀世界人民革命的灯塔。毛泽东思想已深深埋在世界革命人民的心中，特别是埋在被压迫、被剥削人民的心中。”他说：“现在全世界人民特别是革命人民都面向东方，面向中国。因为中国有毛泽东。”
    盖·班马莱通着重地谈到中国人民大学毛主席著作，活学活用毛泽东思想这一伟大创举。他说：“在中国，不论从城市到乡村，还是从工厂到公社，人人学习毛主席著作，运用毛泽东思想。当他们遇到困难的时候，就学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来克服困难。”他说：“中国人民由于运用毛泽东思想，在社会主义建设中取得了巨大成就。”
    他说：“老挝人民象中国人民一样热爱毛主席，学习毛泽东著作。”“在二十多年的反帝斗争中，不论在紧张的战斗中或在战斗的间隙，老挝人民和士兵坚持学习毛泽东思想。老挝人民能打下这么多美国飞机和能粉碎敌人的进攻，是由于运用毛泽东思想的结果。”

    盖·班马莱通对中国目前正在轰轰烈烈展开的文化大革命给予高度评价。他说：“中国的工农兵和革命知识分子，以毛泽东思想为武器，正在向反党反社会主义的黑帮开火，并已取得了巨大胜利。”他说：“这场文化大革命是正确的，是为了巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义思想在中国泛滥，防止在中国产生修正主义，是为了推动社会主义革命和社会主义建设。”他说：“这场文化大革命证明了中国革命的彻底性。”
    盖·班马莱通说：“这次文化大革命是要教育中国青年一代不要忘记阶级斗争，不要忘记过去，特别是教育中国青年做无产阶级的接班人”，“中国文化大革命是给帝国主义和现代修正主义的当头一棒。”
    最近访问中国回国的日本扩大《人民中国》读者积极分子代表团团员神宫寺敬六月三十日在山梨县甲府市向中国记者发表谈话说，毛泽东思想不仅属于中国，而且属于世界人民，它是打倒美帝国主义、粉碎现代修正主义的巨大力量，是世界人民的强有力的哲学理论武器。
    神宫寺在谈到中国的教育情况时说，通过这次访问，他懂得了中国在教育青年方面也是把政治放在第一位的，是用毛泽东思想培养革命的接班人，培养站在世界革命最前列的人。
    神宫寺热情地说，中国人民学习毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想指导行动，给了他极大的鼓舞。他说，特别是从活学活用毛泽东著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫方面得到了很大的启示。他说，这一切都使他下决心要把毛泽东思想真正学到手。
    曾经参加过第一次中日青年大联欢的日本青年团协议会代表富冈淳，在东京欢迎中国青年访日代表团的集会上说：毛泽东主席和毛泽东思想，不仅是中国的，也是我们的。他说，掌握了毛泽东思想的人，是无所畏惧的。他说，他特别对毛主席的武装斗争、全民皆兵、反对现代修正主义的理论和实践有兴趣，这是鼓舞各国人民反美斗争的巨大力量。

    他还说，我们将永远同伟大的毛泽东携手前进，因为他坚决站在我们这一边。
    舒凯里在会上驳斥了约旦国王侯赛因的代表萨德·戈马对中国的诬蔑。他说：“我们不怕对我们同中国和中国伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的友谊的诽谤，相反，我们为我们同中国和毛泽东的友谊而自豪。”
