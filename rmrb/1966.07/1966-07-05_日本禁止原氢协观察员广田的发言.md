	Japanese Council for the Abolition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs observer Koda Shigetoshi today spoke at the plenary session of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' mad invasion of Vietnam. He said that strengthening support for the Vietnamese people has become an extremely urgent task for the people of Asia and Africa and the world who oppose U.S. imperialism and love national independence and peace.

	He spoke about how the Japanese Council for the Abolition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has been fighting against U.S. imperialism and striving for independence and peace for more than ten years. He said that as U.S. imperialism intensifies its invasion of Vietnam, the reactionary forces in Japan that support and assist U.S. imperialism are increasingly strengthening their attacks on us, and the plots of domestic and foreign splitists are becoming more and more blatant. The Japanese Council for the Abolition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, in this storm, continues to hold high the anti-imperialist banner in Japan.

	When talking about the upcoming 12th World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs to be held in Japan, he condemned the domestic and foreign splitists who are attempting to hold a fake conference to engage in splitist activities. He said, "We must resolutely fight against the plots of domestic and foreign splitists."

	Koda Shigetoshi, when talking about the Cairo splitist conference, said that this conference saw the emergence of illegal splitist activities that harm the unity of the people of the world in opposing U.S. imperialism. In this situation, the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers held in Beijing to uphold the correct line is of extremely great significance.

    日本禁止原氢协观察员广田的发言
    新华社四日讯　日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会观察员广田重道今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上发言，强烈谴责美帝国主义对越南人民的疯狂侵略。他说，加强对越南人民的支援，已经成为反对美帝国主义、爱好民族独立与和平的亚非及全世界人民的非常紧急的任务。
    他谈到日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会十多年来一直为反对美帝国主义、争取独立和和平而进行的斗争。他说，随着美帝国主义疯狂地加紧侵略越南，支持和协助美帝国主义的日本反动势力日益加强对我们的进攻，日本国内外分裂主义者的阴谋活动愈来愈露骨。日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会在这个风暴中，仍然把反帝的旗帜高举在日本上空。
    他在谈到即将在日本召开第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会时，谴责日本国内外的分裂主义者企图召开一个冒牌的会议，进行分裂活动。他说，我们要坚决和国内外的分裂主义者的阴谋进行斗争。
    广田重道在谈到开罗分裂会议时说，这次会议出现了危害全世界人民反对美帝国主义团结的、非法的分裂活动。在这种形势下，在北京召开的贯彻正确路线的亚非作家紧急会议，是具有极其重大意义的。
