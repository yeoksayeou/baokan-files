Johnson and his lackeys must understand: they can dispatch 500,000, 1 million, or even more troops to intensify their aggression in South Vietnam. They can use thousands of planes to bomb North Vietnam. However, they cannot shake the iron will and resolve of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist America and save the nation. The war can last 5, 10, 20 years, or even longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be intimidated! Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom. When the day of victory comes, the Vietnamese people will rebuild their homeland more magnificently and splendidly!

New China News Agency, Hanoi, July 17th — On July 17th, Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a "Letter to All Compatriots," severely condemning the barbaric aggression of U.S. imperialism against Vietnam and calling on the Vietnamese people and army to unite as one, fear no hardship or sacrifice, and fight resolutely to complete victory.

The "Letter to All Compatriots" emphasized: "Johnson and his lackeys must understand: they can dispatch 500,000, 1 million, or even more troops to intensify their aggression in South Vietnam. They can use thousands of planes to bomb North Vietnam. However, they cannot shake the iron will and resolve of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist America and save the nation. The more vicious they are, the greater their crimes. The war can last 5, 10, 20 years, or even longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be intimidated! Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom. When the day of victory comes, our people will rebuild their homeland more magnificently and splendidly!"

The "Letter to All Compatriots" reiterated: "The United States must stop its war of aggression against Vietnam, withdraw all its troops and mercenaries from Vietnam, and peace will be immediately restored. Vietnam's position is clear: this is the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. There is no other way!"

The full text of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" is as follows:

	Compatriots and soldiers across the nation!

	The barbaric U.S. imperialists have launched a war of aggression, attempting to annex our country. However, they are suffering a great defeat.

	They have sent nearly 300,000 expeditionary forces into our South. They use their puppets and puppet armies as tools of aggression. They employ chemical poisons, napalm, and other extremely barbaric methods of warfare. They implement a policy of "burning, killing, and destroying everything." They attempt to force our compatriots in the South to surrender through these crimes.

	However, under the resolute and wise leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, our military and people in the South are closely united, fighting bravely, achieving extremely glorious victories, and are determined to fight to complete victory to liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately reunify the country.

	The U.S. bandits brazenly use their air force to attack our North, attempting to escape their defeat in the South and force us to negotiate on their terms.

	However, the North is unshakable. Our military and people are even more actively engaged in production competitions and bravely fighting. So far, we have shot down over 1,200 enemy planes. We are determined to defeat the enemy's war of destruction and wholeheartedly support our compatriots in the South.

	Recently, the U.S. bandits have once again crazily carried out extremely serious "escalation" of the war: they bombed the suburbs of Hanoi and the city of Haiphong. This is a desperate act, like a severely injured beast struggling fiercely before dying.

	Johnson and his lackeys must understand: they can dispatch 500,000, 1 million, or even more troops to intensify their aggression in South Vietnam. They can use thousands of planes to bomb North Vietnam. However, they cannot shake the iron will and resolve of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist America and save the nation. The more vicious they are, the greater their crimes. The war can last 5, 10, 20 years, or even longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be intimidated! Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom. When the day of victory comes, our people will rebuild their homeland more magnificently and splendidly!

	It is well known: every time the U.S. bandits prepare to intensify their criminal war, they play the trick of so-called "peace talks," attempting to deceive world public opinion and shift the blame of not wanting "peace talks" onto Vietnam!

	President Johnson! You must publicly answer the American people and the people of the world: who has violated the Geneva Agreement that guarantees Vietnam's sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity? Is it the Vietnamese army that has invaded the United States and massacred Americans? Is it not the U.S. government that has sent U.S. troops to invade Vietnam and massacre the Vietnamese people?

	The United States must stop its war of aggression against Vietnam, withdraw all its troops and mercenaries from Vietnam, and peace will be immediately restored. Vietnam's position is clear: this is the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. There is no other way!

	The Vietnamese people love peace, true peace, peace based on independence and freedom, not false peace, American-style "peace."

	To defend the independence of the motherland and fulfill our obligations to the peoples fighting against U.S. imperialism, our entire nation and army are united as one, fear no hardship or sacrifice, and will fight resolutely to complete victory. In the past, in much more difficult conditions, we defeated Japanese fascism and French colonialism. Today, domestic and international conditions are more favorable to us, and our people's struggle against American aggression to save the nation will certainly achieve complete victory.

	Dear compatriots and soldiers,

	We are in the right, with the united strength of the people from north to south, with the unyielding fighting tradition, and with the extensive sympathy and support of the socialist brother countries and progressive peoples of the world. We will definitely win!

	In the new situation, we must unite as one, fear no hardship or sacrifice, and resolutely fulfill our glorious historical mission: defeat the American aggressors!

	On this occasion, I, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, express my sincere thanks to the peoples of the socialist countries and the progressive peoples of the world, including the American people, for their wholehearted support and assistance. Currently, facing the new evil plots of U.S. imperialism, I firmly believe that the socialist brother countries and the peoples and governments of the world's peace-loving and just countries will more powerfully support and assist the Vietnamese people in carrying out the struggle against American aggression to save the nation to complete victory.

	The Vietnamese people will win!

	The American aggressors will be defeated!

	Long live a Vietnam that is peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous!

	Compatriots and soldiers across the nation, advance bravely! (Accompanying photo)

　　军民团结一致　不怕艰苦牺牲　彻底战胜美帝
　　胡志明主席发表《告全国同胞书》
　  约翰逊和他的走狗必须懂得：他们可以出动五十万、一百万或者更多的军队来加强对越南南方的侵略战争。他们可以使用成千架飞机来加强对越南北方的轰炸。但是，他们绝不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。战争可以延长五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，河内、海防和其他一些城市、企业可能被摧毁，但是越南人民是不会被吓倒的！没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。在胜利的日子到来的时候，越南人民将重新把自己的祖国建设得更加堂皇，更加壮丽！
    新华社河内十七日电　越南民主共和国主席胡志明十七日发表《告全国同胞书》，严厉谴责美帝国主义野蛮侵略越南的滔天罪行，号召越南人民和军队团结一致，不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。
    《告全国同胞书》强调指出：“约翰逊和他的走狗必须懂得：他们可以出动五十万、一百万或者更多的军队来加强对越南南方的侵略战争。他们可以使用成千架飞机来加强对越南北方的轰炸。但是，他们绝不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。他们越是凶恶，罪恶就越大。战争可以延长五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，河内、海防和其他一些城市、企业可能被摧毁，但是越南人民是不会被吓倒的！没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。在胜利的日子到来的时候，我国人民将重新把自己的祖国建设得更加堂皇，更加壮丽！”
    《告全国同胞书》重申：“美国必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须把美国军队和它的帮凶军全部撤出越南，这样和平就会立即恢复。越南的立场是明确的：这就是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。此外，没有其他办法！”
    胡志明主席发表的《告全国同胞书》全文如下：全国同胞和战士们！
    野蛮的美帝国主义发动了侵略战争，企图并吞我们的国家。但是，它正在遭到大败。
    它大规模地把近三十万远征军开进我国南方。它利用豢养的伪政权和伪军作为侵略的工具。它使用化学毒药、凝固汽油弹等极端野蛮的战争手段。它实行“烧光、杀光、毁光”的政策。它妄图通过这些罪行迫使我国南方同胞屈服。
    但是，在越南南方民族解放阵线的坚决、英明的领导下，我国南方军民紧密团结，英勇战斗，取得了极其辉煌的胜利，并决心战斗到彻底胜利，以解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。
    美国强盗明目张胆地使用空军对我国北方进行袭击，企图摆脱在南方的败局，和迫使我们按照他们的条件进行“谈判”。
    但是，越南北方决不动摇。我们军民更加积极地展开生产竞赛，英勇地进行战斗。迄今为止，我们已经把一千二百多架敌机打得粉身碎骨。我们决心战胜敌人的破坏性战争，同时全心全力地支援骨肉的南方同胞。
    最近，美国强盗竟然又疯狂地进行了极其严重的战争“升级”：他们轰炸了河内郊区和海防市。这是绝望的行动，就象一头受了重伤的野兽，在垂死之前进行凶恶的挣扎。
    约翰逊和他的走狗必须懂得：他们可以出动五十万、一百万或者更多的军队来加强对越南南方的侵略战争。他们可以使用成千架飞机来加强对越南北方的轰炸。但是，他们绝不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。他们越是凶恶，罪恶就越大。战争可以延长五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，河内、海防和其他一些城市、企业可能被摧毁，但是越南人民是不会被吓倒的！没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。在胜利的日子到来的时候，我国人民将重新把自己的祖国建设得更加堂皇，更加壮丽！
    众所周知：美国强盗每逢准备加强罪恶战争时，就玩弄所谓“和平谈判”的骗人把戏，妄图蒙骗世界舆论，并且把不愿“和平谈判”的罪名强加给越南！
    约翰逊总统！你必须公开向美国人民和世界人民回答：是谁破坏了保证越南的主权、独立、统一和领土完整的日内瓦协议？难道是越南军队侵略了美国和屠杀了美国人？难道不是美国政府派遣美国军队来侵略越南和屠杀越南人吗？
    美国必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须把美国军队和它的帮凶军全部撤出越南，这样和平就会立即恢复。越南的立场是明确的：这就是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。此外，没有其他办法！
    越南人民十分热爱和平，热爱真正的和平，在独立、自由基础上的和平，而不是假和平、美国式的“和平”。
    为了保卫祖国的独立，为了履行对正在反对美帝国主义的各个民族所承担的义务，我国全民和全军团结一致，不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。过去，在困难得多的情况下，我们曾经战胜了日本法西斯和法国殖民主义者。今天，国内和国际条件对我们更加有利，我国人民的抗美救国事业必将取得彻底的胜利。
    亲爱的同胞和战士们，
    我们是正义的，有着从北到南的全国人民的团结力量，有着不屈不挠的斗争传统，而且又得到社会主义兄弟国家和全世界进步人民的广泛的同情和支持。我们一定胜利！
    在新的形势下，我们坚决同心协力，不怕一切艰苦和牺牲，坚决完成我们民族光荣的历史使命：战胜美国侵略强盗！
    趁此机会，我谨代表越南人民，对社会主义各国人民和包括美国人民在内的世界进步人民所给予的全心全意的支持和援助表示热烈的感谢。目前，面对美帝国主义的新的罪恶阴谋，我坚信社会主义兄弟国家以及世界爱好和平和主持正义的国家的人民和政府，将更加有力地支持和援助越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到彻底胜利。
    越南人民必胜！
    美国侵略强盗必败！
    和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南万岁！
    全国同胞和战士们，英勇前进！（附图片）
