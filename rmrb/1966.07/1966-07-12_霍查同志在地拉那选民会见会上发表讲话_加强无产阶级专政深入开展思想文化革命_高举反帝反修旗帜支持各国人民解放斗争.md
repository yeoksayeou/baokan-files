Comrade Enver Hoxha, a candidate for the People's Assembly of Albania and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, attended a meeting with voters in Tirana on July 8 and delivered a speech.

Comrade Hoxha first spoke about the achievements of Albania since its liberation, especially in the past five years. He said that our people and our Party have bravely and resolutely withstood and smashed the vicious blockade imposed by the Khrushchevite revisionists, the Tito clique, and their master, American imperialism.

He stressed that the entire Albanian people, young and old, have responded to the Party's call, standing united as one to overcome difficulties, smash the enemy's attacks, defend freedom, socialism, and the motherland, and protect our Party of Labour as we would our own eyes.

Comrade Hoxha went on to say: All the victories achieved by the Albanian people are the result of their national liberation struggle and their struggle to build socialism, the correct Marxist-Leninist leadership of our Party, and the people's power and the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country.

He said that for this reason, all the people of our country are more closely united than ever around the Party and the people's power. Throughout the country, in the mountains and the plains, in the countryside and the cities, a mighty people's revolutionary movement has been launched to develop the economy, strengthen the freedom and independence of the motherland, strengthen the people's power, and raise revolutionary consciousness.

Comrade Hoxha then introduced the draft directives of Albania's Fourth Five-Year Plan. He said that during the new five-year plan period, the main task will be to continue the socialist industrialization of the country. Relying on natural resources, power resources, and labor resources, especially the processing industry, heavy industry, and light industry, will have significant development. In general, we plan to increase the total industrial output by approximately 45 to 50 percent compared to 1965.

Comrade Hoxha said that the new five-year plan opens up a bright prospect for the development of agriculture, which is the most important link in ensuring the fulfillment of the main economic tasks of the five-year plan.

He then pointed out that education and cultural affairs will also continue to develop during the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

Comrade Hoxha spoke in detail about the issue of people's power, emphasizing the need to strengthen people's power and the dictatorship of the proletariat in the future, and to strengthen the role and authority of the people's power organs elected from the People's Assembly to the various levels of committees.

Comrade Hoxha said that Albania is a small country that has built socialism in a capitalist and revisionist-infested Europe, surrounded by imperialists and revisionists who hate our republic and exert pressure on it from all sides.

In this situation, we must always remain vigilant, maintain the proletarian stance, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, develop the country's economy and culture on the solid foundation of socialism, enhance the defensive power of the motherland, and work, live, and think like revolutionaries, always putting the people's, socialist, and revolutionary interests first. We must be prepared in all aspects—economic, political, ideological, and military—to deal with all situations, overcome all obstacles and difficulties, eliminate all enemies, and advance courageously on the road to socialism and communism, raising the sacred banner of Marxism-Leninism and socialism on the Adriatic coast.

Comrade Hoxha then spoke about the international situation, saying: After the continuous great struggle between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism on the international stage, we are naturally proud to see that Marxism-Leninism has defeated the Khrushchevite traitors, and the people have defeated the enemies of the people.

He said that when we conduct our election activities, the international situation is completely favorable to the forces of revolution, socialism, and the freedom of the peoples of all countries, and to the forces of democracy and peace, and is unfavorable to the reactionary forces, to the enemies of the peoples of all countries and socialism—the American imperialists and modern revisionists, and to the anti-people forces around the world.

Comrade Hoxha said that the entire Albanian people, under the leadership of the glorious Party of Labour, have waged a heroic struggle internationally against world imperialism led by American imperialism, against modern revisionism led by Khrushchevite revisionism, and against all reactionaries. Our people and our Party stand shoulder to shoulder with glorious China and the great Communist Party of Mao Zedong in the forefront of the struggle for freedom, democracy, peace, socialism, and communism.

He said that we Albanians are aware of our responsibilities; we are fearless, and nothing can shake our true belief in ultimate victory. It is precisely because we take this correct and courageous stance that the name of socialist Albania and the name of the Party of Labour of Albania are respected and honored by the whole world. Socialist Albania and the Party of Labour of Albania have become a symbol of resistance and revolutionary struggle for all those who fight for the freedom and independence of their own people and for socialism.

Comrade Hoxha said that despite using all means from bombs to military aggression treaties to dollars, the American imperialists are suffering defeats. All these means cannot truly enable them to suppress the resistance of the peoples of all countries.

He said that on its main battlefield in its global strategy, that is, in the various invasions it has carried out against the peoples of all countries, American imperialism has suffered heavy defeats. Its biggest defeat is in the Vietnam War. The heroic and world-renowned Vietnamese people have shown the world that a small nation with a strong people can strike a heavy blow against American imperialism both militarily and politically. The Vietnamese people have torn off the mask of the invaders, smashed the most modern and ferocious weapons, annihilated the elite troops of the invading army, shattered the myth of "American power is very great," and given courage and confidence to the peoples of all countries who are rising up to resist American intervention, inspiring oppressed peoples to struggle and unite to make revolution.

Comrade Hoxha pointed out that the Albanian people, who have always been deeply concerned about the struggle of the fraternal Vietnamese people, have spared no effort and have wholeheartedly supported the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. We have publicly declared in the past and now that we firmly support the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Comrade Hoxha said that in the inhuman deeds of American imperialism and world capitalism, Khrushchev revisionism and Tito revisionism and their followers have acted as the most loyal henchmen and servants. He said that the Khrushchevite revisionists who usurped power in the Soviet Union are turning the Soviet Union into a capitalist country. Through open or secret treaties, they are closely linked with American imperialism in cultural, political, and ideological relations to dominate the world, oppose Marxism-Leninism, socialism, and communism.

He said that at a time when American imperialism is in crisis, Khrushchev and his followers betrayed the Soviet people and the Soviet communists, betrayed the socialist camp and international communism, rushed to help American imperialism, suppressed the revolutionary and national liberation struggles of the peoples of the world, deceived the peoples and communists of all countries with honeyed words, castrated Marxism-Leninism to turn it into the theory of social democracy. Therefore, the Khrushchevite revisionists and their followers have become the agents of American imperialism within the international communist movement. All their activities are to join forces with the American bandits to destroy the bases of socialism everywhere, oppose the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries, use weapons, honeyed words, sabotage, and blackmail to suppress the heroic struggle of the peoples of all countries for national liberation and their resistance. Where there are American troops intervening, there are modern revisionists, who together with the Americans oppose the Congolese people, oppose the heroic Vietnamese; in the Caribbean, in Latin America, in Africa and Asia, it is the same. The Khrushchevite revisionists and American imperialism are the most vicious enemies of the fighting Vietnamese people. These two mortal enemies of the peoples of all countries are trying to strike the Vietnamese people with bombs and surrenderist proposals for "negotiations with the invaders." In the face of the disastrous defeat of the Americans in Vietnam, the Soviet revisionists, like a snake's tail, are trying to make Vietnam surrender, trying to save the Americans from defeat, because the defeat of the Americans in Vietnam is also the defeat of modern revisionism led by Soviet revisionism.

The honeyed words of Soviet revisionism can no longer deceive anyone. Their masks have been torn off, and they have suffered heavy defeats.

Comrade Hoxha pointed out that there is infighting among the modern revisionists, like a pack of wolves, because there can be no unity among them.

When Comrade Hoxha spoke about the fire fight between the Tito clique and the Rankovic clique and the latter being overthrown, he pointed out that the Tito clique, representing the most powerful Croatian-Slovenian bourgeoisie, has purged another bourgeois clique, the Rankovic clique—the Serbian bourgeois clique. He said that this is only the beginning of the downfall of the Tito traitor clique. Their political enmity and fire fight can only intensify, and they will inevitably kill each other. This is their law, the law of the jungle.

He said that the whole world, all countries, and all peoples now clearly see how rotten Tito and his clique are, what kind of terror and violence regime exists in Yugoslavia, what is hidden under the label of "Yugoslavian special socialism," and what it means.

Comrade Hoxha said that the Party of Labour of Albania and the Albanian people have every reason to be proud that they have always raised the great banner of Marxism-Leninism and have fought tooth and nail against the modern revisionist traitors.

Comrade Hoxha went on to say: With great determination, we are advancing on the road to comprehensive socialist construction. On this road, we have many loyal friends and comrades, first and foremost the People's Republic of China. The brotherly friendship and thorough unity between our two parties, our two republics, and our two peoples are a great victory for our people, a major factor in building socialism and defending our motherland, defending the cause of Marxism-Leninism and the world revolutionary cause. Our unity is as strong as steel, it is invincible, and our friendship is eternal, because it is built on the solid foundation of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, because our two parties and our two peoples are fighting the same battle against imperialism and revisionism on all fronts, because they pursue the same goals and are guided by the same Marxist-Leninist thought.

Comrade Hoxha said that in wind and rain, our loyal and powerful ally, the people of China, sincerely defends our cause on the international stage, fighting against imperialism, the enemies of Albania—Khrushchevite modern revisionism and Titoite modern revisionism.

He said that our Party, together with the Communist Party of China, with other Marxist-Leninist parties, and with revolutionary communists around the world, is completely united. Our Party, as always, will provide them with all internationalist support, fully recognizing the existing difficulties, obstacles, and sacrifices that need to be made. It will raise the banner of struggle against imperialism, Khrushchevite and Titoite modern revisionism, and will unreservedly support the revolutionary liberation and anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of all countries.

Comrade Hoxha said: Let us forever raise our Party's revolutionary banner higher, march forward with a marching step, mobilize as we did in the past to complete the tasks of the first year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, and deepen the ideological and cultural revolution in all aspects, making the revolutionary ideas contained in the Party documents penetrate further.

He finally said, Let us make this year, the 25th anniversary of our glorious Party—the leader and organizer of all the victories of our people—and the year our Party holds its Fifth Congress, a year of great revolutionary activities throughout the country. Let us work hard under the slogan of unity of the people, advancing the cause of socialist construction, defending the motherland, strengthening the people's power, the cause of the worker-peasant alliance, and the iron-like unity of the people with the Party.

    霍查同志在地拉那选民会见会上发表讲话
　　加强无产阶级专政深入开展思想文化革命  高举反帝反修旗帜支持各国人民解放斗争
    新华社地拉那十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民议会议员候选人、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查八日在地拉那出席了选民会见会，并发表了讲话。
    霍查同志在讲话中首先谈到了阿尔巴尼亚解放以来，特别是最近五年来所取得的成就。他说，我国人民和我们党勇敢坚决地顶住并且粉碎了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者、铁托分子及其主子美帝国主义者的凶恶封锁。
    他强调指出，阿尔巴尼亚全体人民不分老幼，响应了党的号召，象一个人一样地挺立起来，克服困难，粉碎了敌人的进攻，保卫自由、社会主义和祖国，象保卫眼珠一样地保卫我们劳动党。
    霍查同志接着说：阿尔巴尼亚人民所取得的所有胜利，都是我国人民进行民族解放斗争和为建设而奋斗的结果，是劳动党的马克思列宁主义的正确领导以及人民政权和我国无产阶级专政的结果。
    他说，正因为如此，我国全体人民比以往任何时候都更加紧密地团结在党和人民政权的周围，在全国，无论是在山区和平原，无论是在农村和城市，掀起了波澜壮阔的人民革命运动，以便发展经济，加强祖国的自由和独立，加强人民政权，提高革命觉悟。
    霍查同志接着介绍阿尔巴尼亚第四个五年计划指示草案，他说，在新的五年计划期间，主要的任务将是继续推进国家的社会主义工业化。依靠自然资源、动力资源和劳动资源，特别是加工工业、重工业和轻工业部门将有大的发展。大体上说，我们打算使工业的总产值比一九六五年增长大约百分之四十五到五十。
    霍查同志说，新的五年计划为发展农业开辟了光辉的前景，而农业是保证实现五年计划主要经济任务的最重要的一环。
    他接着指出，在第四个五年计划期间，教育和文化事业也将不断地发展。
    霍查同志详尽地谈了人民政权的问题，着重提出了今后加强人民政权和无产阶级专政的问题，加强选举产生的、从人民议会到各级委员会的人民权力机构的作用和职权的问题。
    霍查同志说，阿尔巴尼亚是一个小国，它是在资本主义的和感染着修正主义的欧洲中建立社会主义的，它受到帝国主义者和修正主义者的包围，他们刻骨地憎恨我们的共和国，并且多方面向它施加压力。
    在这种情况下，我们必须始终保持警惕，坚持无产阶级的立场，加强无产阶级专政，在社会主义的牢固的基础上发展国家的经济和文化，增强祖国的防御力量，始终象革命者那样地工作、生活和思考，把人民的、社会主义的和革命的利益放在第一位。我们必须在经济、政治、思想和军事等各方面作好准备，以应付一切局势，克服一切障碍和困难，消灭一切敌人，在社会主义和共产主义的道路上勇往直前，在亚得里亚海滨高举马克思列宁主义和社会主义的神圣旗帜。
    霍查同志接着在谈到国际形势时说：在国际上马克思列宁主义和修正主义之间不断进行了大搏斗之后，我们理所当然自豪地看到，马克思列宁主义战胜了赫鲁晓夫式的叛徒们，人民战胜了人民的敌人。
    他说，我们进行选举活动的时候，国际局势完全有利于革命、社会主义和各国人民自由的力量，有利于民主和平力量，而不利于反动势力，不利于各国人民和社会主义的敌人——美帝国主义者和现代修正主义者，不利于世界各地的反人民势力。
    霍查同志说，全体阿尔巴尼亚人民，在光荣的劳动党领导下，在国际上对以美帝国主义为首的世界帝国主义，对以赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义为首的现代修正主义和一切反动派进行了英勇的斗争。我国人民和我们党同光荣的中国和毛泽东的伟大的共产党并肩站在为自由、民主、和平、社会主义和共产主义而进行的斗争的最前列。
    他说，我们阿尔巴尼亚人认识到我们承担的责任，我们是无所畏惧的，任何东西都不能动摇我们对最后胜利的真正信念。正因为采取这种正确的和勇敢的立场，社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚的名字和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的名字受到全世界的尊重和尊敬，社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党已经成为所有为本国人民的自由和独立、为社会主义而斗争的人们进行抵抗和革命斗争的象征。
    霍查同志说，美帝国主义者尽管在全世界使用了从炸弹到军事侵略条约直到美元的一切手段，但是他们正在遭受失败，所有这些手段都不能真正使他们有可能压倒各国人民的抵抗。
    他说，在它的全球战略的主要战线上，就是说，美帝国主义对各国人民所进行的各种各样的侵略中，遭受了惨重的失败。它的最大的失败是在越南战争中的失败。英雄的、举世歌颂的越南人民向全世界表明，一个小国的坚强的人民，在军事上和政治上狠狠地打击了美帝国主义。越南人民撕破了侵略者的假面具，打烂了最现代化和最凶恶的武器，消灭了侵略军的精锐部队，粉碎了所谓“美国力量大得很”的神话，给予世界上起来反对美国干涉的各国人民以勇气和信心，激励被压迫人民进行斗争，协力同心闹革命。
    霍查指出，对兄弟的越南人民的斗争事业贴心关怀的阿尔巴尼亚人民，过去和现在都不遗余力地、一心一意地支持越南人民的正义斗争。我们过去和现在都公开宣布我们完全支持越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明的坚定立场。
    霍查同志说，在美帝国主义和世界资本主义所进行的灭绝人性的勾当中，赫鲁晓夫修正主义，铁托修正主义及其追随者充当了最忠实的帮凶和仆从。他说，篡夺了苏联政权的赫鲁晓夫修正主义者正在把苏联变成一个资本主义国家。他们通过公开或秘密的条约以文化的、政治的和意识形态的联系，紧密地同美帝国主义勾结在一起，以便主宰世界，反对马克思列宁主义、社会主义和共产主义。
    他说，正当美帝国主义经历危机的时候，赫鲁晓夫及其追随者背叛苏联人民和苏联共产党人，背叛社会主义阵营和国际共产主义，赶紧去帮美帝国主义的忙，镇压世界各国人民的革命和民族解放斗争，用笼络人心的手法欺骗各国人民和共产党人，阉割马克思列宁主义而使之成为社会民主主义的理论。因此，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其追随者成了美帝国主义在国际共产主义运动内部的代理人。他们的全部活动，就是和美国强盗联合起来，到处破坏社会主义的根据地，反对中华人民共和国及其他社会主义国家，用武器、用笼络人心的伎俩，通过破坏活动和讹诈镇压各国人民争取民族解放的英勇斗争和他们的抵抗。有美国军队干涉的地方，就有现代修正主义者，他们和美国人一起反对刚果人民，反对英雄的越南；在加勒比海、在拉丁美洲、在非洲和亚洲，也是这样。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和美帝国主义，是战斗的越南人民的最凶恶的敌人。各国人民的这两个死敌竭力用炸弹和关于同侵略者进行“和谈”的投降主义建议来打击越南。在美国在越南遭受灾难性失败的情况下，象蛇尾巴似的苏联修正主义者力图使越南屈服投降，力图把美国从失败中解救出来，因为美国人在越南的失败，也就是以苏联修正主义为首的现代修正主义的失败。
    苏联修正主义笼络人心的伎俩已难于再欺骗任何人了。他们的假面具已被撕破了，他们遭到惨重的失败。
    霍查同志指出，现代修正主义者内部好象狼群一样地互相撕咬，因为在他们之间不可能存在团结。
    霍查在谈到南斯拉夫铁托集团同兰科维奇集团发生火并，并且把它赶下台去的时候指出，代表最强大的克罗地亚—斯洛文尼亚资产阶级集团的铁托—卡德尔资产阶级集团清洗了另一个资产阶级集团，兰科维奇集团——塞尔维亚资产阶级集团。他说，这仅仅是铁托叛徒集团灭亡的开端。在他们之间的政治上敌对和火并只能加剧，并且他们必将相互残杀。这就是他们的规律，这就是弱肉强食的规律。
    他说，全世界，所有国家和各国人民现在都已经清楚地看到铁托及其集团多么腐朽，在南斯拉夫存在的是什么样的恐怖和暴力政权，在“南斯拉夫特殊的社会主义”的标签下隐藏着什么货色，它意味着什么。
    霍查同志说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民有理由感到自豪的是，他们一直高举着马克思列宁主义的伟大旗帜，过去和现在都针锋相对地同现代修正主义叛徒们作斗争。
    霍查同志接着说，我们以巨大的决心在全面建设社会主义的道路上前进。在这条道路上，我们有许多忠实的朋友和同志，首先是中华人民共和国。我们两党、两个共和国、两国人民之间的兄弟友谊和彻底团结是我国人民的巨大胜利，是建设社会主义和捍卫我们祖国、捍卫马克思列宁主义事业和世界革命事业的重大因素。我们的团结象钢铁一样，它是不可战胜的，我们的友谊是永恒的，因为它是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的坚固基础之上的，因为我们两党和两国人民在一切战线上对帝国主义和修正主义进行着同一场战斗，因为他们追求的是同样的目的和同样以马克思列宁主义思想为指南。
    霍查同志说，在风里雨里，我们忠实和强大的盟友人民中国，热诚地在国际舞台上保卫我们的事业，同帝国主义、阿尔巴尼亚的敌人——赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义和铁托现代修正主义进行斗争。
    他说，我们劳动党同中国共产党、同其他马克思列宁主义政党，同世界各地的革命的共产党人组织完全团结一致，我们劳动党一如既往将向他们提供一切国际主义的支援，它完全认识到存在着的困难、障碍和需要作出的牺牲，它将高举反对帝国主义、反对赫鲁晓夫和铁托现代修正主义的斗争旗帜，将毫无保留地支持各国人民的革命解放和反帝斗争。
    霍查同志说：让我们永远更高地举起我们党的革命旗帜，以进军的步伐向前迈进，象以往那样动员起来，来完成第四个五年计划的第一年的计划任务，把我们的思想、文化革命在各方面进一步深入下去，使党的文件中所包含的革命思想进一步深入下去。
    他最后说，让我们把我们光荣的劳动党——我国人民的一切胜利的领导者和组织者——二十五周年，和我们党举行第五次代表大会的这一年成为全国各地已经和将要展开伟大革命活动的一年。让我们在人民团结的口号下，努力工作，把社会主义建设、保卫祖国，加强人民政权的事业，工农联盟和人民同党的钢铁般的团结的事业推向前进。（附图片）
