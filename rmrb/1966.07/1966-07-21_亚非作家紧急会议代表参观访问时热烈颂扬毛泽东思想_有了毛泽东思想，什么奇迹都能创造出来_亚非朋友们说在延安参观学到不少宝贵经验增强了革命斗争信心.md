Delegates of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers enthusiastically praise Mao Zedong Thought during their visit. With Mao Zedong Thought, any miracle can be created. Asian and African friends say they have learned many valuable experiences from their visit to Yan'an, which has strengthened their confidence in revolutionary struggle.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 20th: Some foreign friends attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers ended their visit to Yan'an, the holy land of the Chinese revolution, and departed by special plane to Xi'an in the afternoon.

During their visit to Yan'an, Asian and African friends used sincere language to enthusiastically praise the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great Mao Zedong Thought. They said that being able to visit the place where Chairman Mao had long fought was an honor for life, and they received great education and inspiration, learned many valuable experiences, and strengthened their confidence in revolutionary struggle. The Angolan representative, Dakru, said after visiting the Yan'an Revolutionary Memorial Hall that he had a deeper understanding of the great victory achieved by Chairman Mao in leading the Chinese people to armed struggle. He said that Mao Zedong Thought reflects the will of the Chinese people. He also said that Yan'an was the center of Chairman Mao's long-term leadership of the Chinese people in armed revolutionary struggle, and now the revolutionary spirit of Yan'an has spread to all parts of the world. When visiting the places where Chairman Mao had lived, such as Fenghuang Mountain, Zaoyuan, and Wangjiaping, the representatives showed their deep respect for Chairman Mao by touching the chairs and stationery he had used. The corn that Chairman Mao had personally planted in Yangjialing was growing vigorously. The guests came to visit and eagerly added soil and watered the corn. Some representatives even took a handful of soil wrapped in a handkerchief to take back with them. An Indonesian representative, holding the hands of the old Red Army soldiers Dai Yicai and Wei Qingming, said excitedly, "We are also soldiers of Chairman Mao, because Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of world revolution in contemporary times." Many representatives said that Yan'an is not only the holy land of the Chinese revolution but also the holy land of the world's oppressed peoples. Before leaving Yan'an, they left messages praising Chairman Mao as not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, and expressed their determination to forever learn from the revolutionary spirit of Yan'an.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 20th: Some foreign friends attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers held a discussion with National People's Congress representative and acrobat from the Wuhan Acrobatic Troupe, Xia Juhua, on the 19th. They highly evaluated Xia Juhua's growth under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and enthusiastically praised the great Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon for revolutionary people to be invincible. They said that with Mao Zedong Thought, any miracle can be created in the world.

This discussion was held at the invitation of representatives from Malaysia, Nepal, Swaziland, North Kalimantan, Syria, and Madagascar. These foreign friends eagerly wanted to know how Xia Juhua grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and how she actively studies and applies Chairman Mao's works.

During the discussion, Xia Juhua told the foreign friends that she was a child who suffered immense hardship and abuse in the old society. At the age of five, she was sent to an acrobat master as an adopted daughter to learn acrobatics. After liberation, she gained a new life under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Since 1955, she has insisted on actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, determined to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the proletarian politics with her acrobatic art for life. She armed herself with Mao Zedong Thought, overcame various difficulties on the road to progress, and achieved outstanding results, becoming a revolutionary artist of the proletariat. She said that without the nurturing of the Party and Mao Zedong Thought and the help of the masses, she could not have achieved any results.

Xia Juhua's vivid experience of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works deeply moved the friends from various countries. The Malaysian representative, Sharma, said that Xia Juhua's speech was very inspiring. Things that seemed almost impossible to achieve became easy for Xia Juhua to master. This is because she was armed with a certain force, which is Mao Zedong Thought. This proves that ordinary people have immense power as long as they firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought. He said that Xia Juhua not only devoted herself to the Chinese revolution but also to the world revolution, which is a noble thought taught by the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, a correct path not only for millions of Chinese people but also for the Malaysian people, Asian and African people, and people all over the world. This shows the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. To make ourselves fully effective, we must arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought.

The Swaziland representative, D. Ntshumalo, said that Xia Juhua's speech was very convincing and a great education for him. He believed that as long as one studies Chairman Mao's works well and follows the correct line, nothing in the world is impossible. The Nepalese representative, Bhatt, said that after listening to Xia Juhua's account of how she overcame difficulties and actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, he understood why Chairman Mao's works could produce miraculous power and change a person's outlook. The Syrian representative, Zadat Rikaibi, said that from Xia Juhua's experience, we saw the path to liberation for all oppressed peoples, which is the correct path obtained from the savior of the people, Chairman Mao. The Syrian representative, Salamah Obeid, said that from Chairman Mao's teachings and the experience of the Chinese people, we saw the hope and future of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 20th: Some foreign friends attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers arrived in Changsha by special train from Wuhan in the morning.

In the evening, Vice Governor Wang Hanyu of Hunan Province received and hosted a banquet for the guests. Wang Hanyu spoke at the banquet. He praised the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers as a revolutionary, united, and victorious conference of the 2 billion people of Asia and Africa against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States. He thanked the foreign friends for their enthusiastic praise of our country's great leader, Chairman Mao, and the great Mao Zedong Thought at this conference. He also expressed his firm support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to resist America and save their country. The leader of the Tanzanian delegation, Yahya Muhammad Hassan, said, "Changsha is a city with a long history of revolutionary struggle. Chairman Mao and his comrades, such as Chairman Liu Shaoqi, lived and fought here. This revolutionary place is worth the pride of revolutionary people, and we will never forget this city." He continued, "This afternoon, we visited the revolutionary site of Qinghuatan and learned a lot about revolutionary struggle, which inspired us. We believe that the Chinese people will forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and achieve continuous victories in the revolution. We believe that China's victory is our victory, and China's development is our development."

    亚非作家紧急会议代表参观访问时热烈颂扬毛泽东思想
    有了毛泽东思想，什么奇迹都能创造出来
    亚非朋友们说在延安参观学到不少宝贵经验增强了革命斗争信心
    据新华社延安二十日电　出席亚非作家紧急会议的部分外国朋友，今天结束了对中国革命圣地延安的参观访问，于下午乘专机去西安。
    亚非朋友们在延安访问期间，用真挚的语言热烈颂扬中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想。他们说，能在毛主席长期战斗过的地方参观访问，是毕生的荣幸，受到了极大的教育和鼓舞，学到了不少宝贵的经验，增强了革命斗争的信心。安哥拉代表达克鲁斯说，他看了延安革命纪念馆后，对毛主席领导中国人民用武装斗争取得的伟大胜利，有了进一步的理解。他说，毛泽东思想反映了中国人民的意志。他还说，延安是毛主席长期领导中国人民进行武装革命斗争的中心，现在延安的革命精神，已传播到世界各地。在参观毛主席住过的凤凰山、枣园、王家坪时，代表们有的抚摸着毛主席坐过的凳子和用过的文具，对毛主席表现了无限敬仰的心情。毛主席当年在杨家岭亲手种过的地，正长着茁壮的玉米。客人们前来参观时争着给玉米培土，端水浇地。有的代表还抓了一把土包在手帕里准备带回去。印度尼西亚一位代表激动地握着老红军战士戴义才和魏清明的手说，我们也是毛主席的战士，因为毛主席是当代世界革命最伟大的领袖。许多代表说，延安不仅是中国革命的圣地，也是世界被压迫人民的革命圣地。他们在离开延安前，纷纷留言赞扬毛主席不但是中国人民的伟大领袖，同时也是世界革命人民的伟大领袖，并表示要永远学习延安的革命精神。
    据新华社武汉二十日电　正在武汉访问的出席亚非作家紧急会议的部分外国朋友，十九日同全国人大代表、武汉市杂技团演员夏菊花举行座谈。他们对夏菊花在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的经历，给予了高度评价，热烈赞扬伟大的毛泽东思想是革命人民战无不胜的强大武器。他们说，有了毛泽东思想，世界上什么奇迹都能创造得出来。
    这次座谈是应马来亚、尼泊尔、斯威士兰、北加里曼丹、叙利亚、马尔加什等国家和地区的代表邀请举行的。这些外国朋友迫切要求了解夏菊花如何在毛泽东思想哺育下成长，以及活学活用毛主席著作的情况。
    在座谈中，夏菊花告诉外国朋友，她在旧社会是个受尽摧残和虐待的苦孩子。五岁那年就被送给一个杂技班主当养女，学杂技。解放后，她在党和毛主席的领导下获得了新生。从一九五五年以来，她坚持活学活用毛主席著作，决心以自己的杂技艺术，为工农兵、为无产阶级政治服务一辈子。她用毛泽东思想武装自己，不断战胜前进道路上各种困难，取得了卓越的成绩，成为一个无产阶级的革命的文艺战士。她说，如果没有党和毛泽东思想的哺育和群众的帮助，我什么成绩都做不出来。
    夏菊花活学活用毛主席著作的生动事迹，使各国朋友深受感动。马来亚代表沙尔玛说，夏菊花的讲话非常鼓舞人心。那些看来几乎是完全不可能做到的事情，对夏菊花来说，却很容易掌握了。这是因为她用某种力量武装起来了，那就是毛泽东思想。这证明：普通的人民是有无比力量的，只要人民牢固地掌握了毛泽东思想。他说，夏菊花不仅把自己献身于中国革命，而且还献身于世界革命，这是中国共产党和毛主席所教导的，是一种高尚的思想。夏菊花所走的道路，不仅对千千万万中国人民来说是一条正确的道路，也给马来亚人民、亚非人民、全世界人民指出了正确的道路。这就是毛泽东思想有着巨大的威力，要使我们自己充分发挥作用，就必须用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑。
    斯威士兰代表多·恩修马洛说，夏菊花的讲话说服力很强，对我是很大的教育。我相信只要好好读毛主席的著作，同时执行正确的路线，世界上没有什么事情是办不到的。尼泊尔代表巴塔说，听了夏菊花怎样克服困难，怎样活学活用毛主席著作，我才懂得了毛主席的著作为什么能产生奇迹般的力量，为什么能够改变一个人的思想面貌的道理。叙利亚代表扎达特·里卡比说，我们从夏菊花的经历中，看到了一切受压迫人民解放的道路，这就是从人民的救星毛主席那里得到的正确道路。叙利亚代表萨拉马赫·奥贝德说，我们从毛主席的教导和中国人民的经验中，看到了中国人民和世界人民的希望和未来。
    据新华社长沙二十日电　出席亚非作家紧急会议的一部分外国朋友，今天上午乘专车从武汉到达长沙。
    当晚，湖南省副省长王含馥接见并设宴招待客人。王含馥在宴会上致词。他赞扬亚非作家紧急会议是亚非二十亿人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的一次革命的大会，团结的大会，胜利的大会。他感谢外国朋友们在这次会上热烈颂扬我国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想。他还表示坚决支持兄弟的越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争。坦桑尼亚代表团团长叶海雅·穆罕默德·哈桑尼说：“长沙市是一个具有悠久革命斗争历史的城市，毛泽东主席和他的战友刘少奇主席等都在这里生活过，斗争过。这个革命的地方是值得革命人民骄傲的，我们将永远不会忘记这个城市。”他接着说：“今天下午我们参观了革命纪念地清水塘，学到了许多革命斗争的东西，使我们受到了鼓舞。我们相信，中国人民将永远忠于毛泽东思想，使革命不断获得胜利。我们认为，中国的胜利，就是我们的胜利，中国的发展也是我们的发展。”
