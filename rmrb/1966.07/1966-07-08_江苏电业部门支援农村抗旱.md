The workers of the Jiangsu Electric Power Department, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, have established the principle of serving agriculture and the five hundred million peasants. They have broken away from old habits, old styles, and old frameworks, and are sending more electricity to the countryside, helping commune members to use electricity effectively, and supporting the broad masses of commune members in their anti-drought and rush-seeding efforts.

In recent years, the irrigation and drainage industry in Jiangsu has developed significantly. Since the second half of last year, the broad masses of workers, through political discussions and the study of Chairman Mao's works, especially through the further implementation of Chairman Mao's directive on the general policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, have heightened their awareness of serving agriculture.

The workers of the electric power department have investigated the power usage of major factories in cities such as Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou, and have proposed adjusting work shifts and power usage times to free up daytime electricity to support rural anti-drought efforts.

According to the national unified allocation, Shanghai can allocate some electricity to support Jiangsu. However, the previous "regulation" for this high-voltage line could not pass so much current. The workers of the electric power department, with a strong sense of responsibility to support their peasant brothers in the anti-drought efforts, and under the inspiration of the current Cultural Revolution, have broken away from superstition and conducted a specific analysis of this "regulation" set by "foreign authorities." As a result, they modified the "regulation" based on actual conditions, allowing this high-voltage line to transmit more electricity every day.

    江苏电业部门支援农村抗旱
    江苏电业部门职工，遵照毛主席的教导，树立为农业服务、为五亿农民服务的观点，打破“旧习惯”“旧作风”“旧框框”，为农村多送电，帮助社员用好电，支援广大社员抗旱抢种。
    近几年来，江苏电力排灌事业有了大量发展。去年下半年以来，广大职工通过突出政治讨论和大学毛主席著作，特别是通过进一步贯彻毛主席提出的以农业为基础、以工业为主导的发展国民经济总方针和有关指示，提高了为农业服务自觉性。
    电业部门职工对南京、镇江、扬州、常州、无锡、苏州等城市的主要工厂，逐家摸清了用电情况，提出调整开工班次和用电时间，把白天的电让出来支援农村抗旱的意见。
    根据国家统一调配，上海可以调一部分电支援江苏，但是，这一路的高压电线过去的“规定”不能通过这么多电流。电业部门职工，怀着支援农民兄弟抗旱的强烈责任感，在当前文化大革命形势的鼓舞下，破除迷信，对这个由“外国权威”制订的“规定”进行具体分析。结果，他们根据实际情况修改了“规定”，使这条高压线每天能多输送电。
