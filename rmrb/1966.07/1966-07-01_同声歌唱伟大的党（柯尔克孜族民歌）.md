	People of all ethnic groups are like close brothers,
	United and loving, forever together.
	The Party is our great mother,
	Nurturing all the children of the ethnic groups.

	We stood shoulder to shoulder and drove away the darkness,
	Bringing the bright present day.
	Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought,
	We stride forward bravely and vigorously.

	We bask in the warm sunshine,
	Forever following our beloved Party.
	Chests puffed out, spirits high,
	Marching on the revolutionary path.

	We are united like a rock,
	Our revolutionary friendship is as deep as the ocean.
	Mao Zedong Thought nurtures our growth,
	We sing in unison to praise the great Party.

    同声歌唱伟大的党
    （柯尔克孜族民歌）各民族人民如同亲兄弟，团结友爱，永远在一起。党是我们伟大的母亲，把各民族儿女哺育。我们并肩驱走了黑暗，换来了光明的今天。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，迈开大步奋勇向前。我们沐浴着温暖的阳光，永远跟着我们亲爱的党。挺起胸膛，斗志昂扬，行进在革命的大道上。我们团结得象磐石一样，革命的情谊深似海洋。毛泽东思想哺育我们成长，我们同声歌唱伟大的党。
