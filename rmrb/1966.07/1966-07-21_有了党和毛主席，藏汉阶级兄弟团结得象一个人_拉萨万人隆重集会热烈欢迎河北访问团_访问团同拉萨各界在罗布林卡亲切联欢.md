Lhasa, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 10,000 people from various ethnic groups and sectors in Lhasa held a grand rally at the Lhasa Sports Stadium on July 19 to warmly welcome the delegation from Hebei Province, which traveled thousands of miles.

Wang Qimei, Secretary of the CPC Tibet Autonomous Region Committee, Alphai Wangjinmei, Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Zhao Wenjin, a responsible official of the Tibet Military Region, along with other leaders and active learners of Chairman Mao's works from Lhasa, attended the rally.

The Lhasa Sports Stadium was filled with a festive atmosphere and the spirit of national unity. A large banner reading "Warmly Welcome the Hebei Province Delegation" was hung in front of the stage. On both sides, there were banners in Tibetan and Chinese reading "Long Live the Great Leader of the Chinese People of All Nationalities, Chairman Mao," "Long Live the Great Unity of the Chinese People of All Nationalities," and so on. In the morning, workers, peasants, citizens, and soldiers from various ethnic groups, holding colorful flags and bouquets, joyfully gathered from all directions to welcome their dear relatives.

Wang Qimei, on behalf of the CPC Tibet Autonomous Region Committee and the people of the entire Tibet Autonomous Region, expressed the warmest welcome and deepest gratitude to the entire delegation from Hebei Province. He said that the Tibetan people highly appreciate and admire the great victory achieved by the people of the Xingtai Region in Hebei Province in overcoming natural disasters. They regard their victory as their own. This visit by the Hebei Province delegation to our region not only brings a large amount of materials to support our agricultural and pastoral production and construction but, more importantly, brings the friendship of 47 million class brothers from Hebei Province and a great encouragement for our region to carry out socialist revolution, socialist construction, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He called on the Tibetan people and all cadres and workers to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Hebei people in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to learn from their noble communist style, and to apply this revolutionary spirit to their actual work. He said, "Let us raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and strive to build a prosperous and happy socialist new Tibet."

Under the warm applause, Han Zhenkai, the leader of the Hebei Province delegation, spoke. He thanked the CPC Tibet Autonomous Region Committee, the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Committee, and the millions of liberated serfs for their deep class feelings, sending representatives to cross mountains and rivers, traveling thousands of miles, to personally deliver horses to the disaster-stricken areas of Hebei Province, providing great support to the disaster-stricken people. He said that this not only increased our material strength to develop production and rebuild our homes but, more importantly, increased our spiritual strength to develop production and overcome natural disasters. Han Zhenkai also enthusiastically praised the great victories achieved by the broad masses of the Tibetan people in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, in working hard, and in socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Pabala Gelangjie, Vice Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said in his speech: The continuous seven-year bumper harvest and the current good situation in various construction projects in Tibet are inseparable from the strong support of various brotherly nationalities. This time, the Hebei Province delegation, bringing the deep affection of the brotherly people of Hebei Province, came to Tibet for a visit. Such a moving event can only occur in the great era of Mao Zedong, in the socialist family. Our people say well: "With the Party and Chairman Mao, we and the Han brothers are united as one, walking on the bright path of socialism." He said, we have a common lifeline, that is, Mao Zedong Thought.

The representative of the liberated serfs, Ciren, the Party branch secretary of Najin Township, expressed his heartfelt thanks for the noble communist style of the Hebei class brothers who personally delivered a large amount of production materials to them and sent worker comrades to teach them technology. He said that they would definitely learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Hebei class brothers in using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, to achieve the eighth consecutive bumper harvest, and to express their gratitude to the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Hebei class brothers with practical actions.

The responsible officials of the Tibet Military Region, the mayor of Lhasa, and the worker representatives also spoke at the meeting.

Wang Qimei and Alphai Wangjinmei, on behalf of the Party, government, and military of Tibet, presented a banner to the Hebei Province delegation. The banner, written in Tibetan and Chinese, read: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen national unity, and strive together to build a powerful socialist motherland." The meeting also read out the list of gifts presented by the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee to the Tibetan farmers and herdsmen. Some of the materials donated by Hebei Province, such as fine sheep, water pumps, and other production tools, were exhibited on the spot. The attendees enthusiastically visited the exhibition.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 19 -- The Hebei Province delegation, carrying the deep class feelings of 47 million people from Hebei Province, arrived in Tibet for a visit on July 17 and held a get-together with over 10,000 workers, suburban farmers, citizens, students, government officials, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa at the Norbulingka.

When the delegation arrived at Norbulingka, they were warmly welcomed by the people of Lhasa. Wherever the delegation representatives went, they were greeted with applause, drumbeats, and revolutionary songs. The delegation representatives and the people of Lhasa together watched many wonderful songs, dances, and drama performances. Five political and cultural work teams that had just returned from rural and pastoral areas performed over 30 items in Norbulingka.

On the lawn and under the shade of the trees, the delegation representatives sat with the Tibetan people, drinking butter tea, chatting, and exchanging their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The delegation leader Han Zhenkai and deputy leader Feng Shiying said to the members of the agricultural production mutual aid groups and handicraft production mutual aid groups: Today, we are having a get-together with you, heart to heart, talking, this is only possible in the era of Mao Zedong. They encouraged the Tibetan brothers to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, sweep away all ghosts and monsters, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. The member of the agricultural mutual aid group and the chairman of the residents' committee, Duden, on behalf of all the members, said: Thank you for the care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and thank you for the strong support of all brotherly nationalities to Tibet. He said that they would definitely learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Hebei people in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and overcoming natural disasters.

During the friendly conversation, the 97-year-old poor peasant from the Lhasa Balang Residents' Committee, Taqing, tightly held the hands of Song Qindi, the Party branch secretary of Dongshaliang Village in the epicenter of the Xingtai earthquake, and said with tears in his eyes: "You traveled thousands of miles to visit us. You brought the care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the deep affection of the Hebei brothers. Although I am old, I will definitely learn from your spirit of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and overcoming difficulties to build a socialist new Tibet."
