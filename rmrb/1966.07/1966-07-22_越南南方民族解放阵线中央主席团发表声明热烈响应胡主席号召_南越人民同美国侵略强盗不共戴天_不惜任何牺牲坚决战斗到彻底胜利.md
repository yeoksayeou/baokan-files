The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on July 20, enthusiastically responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call on July 17 in his "Letter to the Nation" to the people and soldiers of the entire country, expressing the determination of the entire people and the armed forces of South Vietnam to contribute all their material and spiritual strength, to make any sacrifice, and to pay any price to complete the sacred task of resisting the Americans and saving the country. They are deeply convinced that they will achieve a complete victory. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On July 17, 1966, Chairman Ho Chi Minh called on all compatriots and soldiers to resolutely advance the cause of resisting American imperialist aggression, to defend the North, liberate the South, and ultimately reunify the country. Chairman Ho Chi Minh called on: "To defend the independence of the motherland, to fulfill the obligations to the various nations that are opposing American imperialism, our entire people and army must unite as one, fear no hardships or sacrifices, and resolutely fight to the end for a complete victory."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh also issued a partial mobilization order to vigorously promote the cause of resistance.

The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam enthusiastically responds to the call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the entire nation, which reflects the stance, will, and aspirations of our entire nation. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam warmly welcomes the partial mobilization order from the North and warmly welcomes the new efforts made by the Northern compatriots for the sacred cause of resisting the Americans and saving the country. This is a tremendous encouragement to the Southern compatriots who are on the front lines of the anti-American struggle.

The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam sincerely thanks the Northern compatriots for their full support. The entire people and the armed forces of the South are determined to contribute all their material and spiritual strength to fulfill their obligations to the motherland: to defend the North, liberate the South, and reunify the country. This is a sacred and inviolable obligation, the highest honor. The people of the South will not hesitate to make any sacrifice, no matter what the cost, to complete this task.

American imperialism is sinking deeper into the evil war of aggression against Vietnam. It suffered defeat in the "special war" and sent American troops and their lackeys to openly occupy the South, escalate the war, destroy the North, and even attack the Hanoi and Haiphong areas. In the South, it has occupied many cities and lands of our motherland, using various weapons to massacre our people, implementing a "scorched earth" policy of "burning, killing, and destroying" in both rural and urban areas, regardless of age or gender, even innocent infants are not spared. In the North, it indiscriminately bombs hospitals, schools, factories, and dikes, attempting to force our people to surrender through death and destruction. Throughout the world, it spreads the rhetoric of "peace talks," attempting to deceive all humanity and conceal its blatantly brutal and war-mongering face of aggression.

However, our people will never surrender, nor will we fall for the imperialists' tricks. For many years, the hatred of the Southern people has piled up like a mountain; we have an unyielding grudge against the American aggressors. Even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble, the oath "we will never be the slaves of the aggressors" remains deeply etched in the hearts of the Southern people, and with the passage of time, this oath resonates even more strongly. The Southern people are willing to fight alongside their compatriots throughout the country, even if it takes five, ten, twenty years, or even longer, to carry out the anti-American struggle to a complete victory.

The Southern people, like the people of the entire country, are very fond of peace. For our people, peace means that not a single American aggressor or lackey remains in Vietnam to threaten our people. This is the only way to restore peace. As long as American imperialism remains in our country, the anti-American struggle of the Southern people will not stop for a single day until independence, democracy, and ultimately peace are achieved.

The people and armed forces of the South respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call, determined to learn from the Northern military and people, to launch a campaign for excellence in all fields, and to vigorously advance the cause of national salvation and resistance.

The military and people of the South are determined to destroy and disintegrate more American and puppet troops, and currently, to achieve the greatest victories in all aspects of this rainy season.

The military and people of the South are determined to overcome all difficulties and hardships, to strengthen their forces in all aspects. They enthusiastically enlist in the army, join the labor corps and youth shock troops, and contribute to victory.

The military and people of the South are determined to defend and expand the liberated areas, to defend their hometowns, to increase production, and to smash the "pacification" plans of the American bandits and their lackeys.

The people of various cities in the South are determined to broadly strengthen unity, build powerful forces, vigorously promote the struggle against American imperialism and the puppet regime, strive for national, democratic, and people's rights, smash the enemy's rule in the cities, and be ready at any time to seize the opportunity to achieve greater victories.

Our military and people are defeating American imperialism and its lackeys and are confident of achieving a complete victory. Our resistance cause is developing by leaps and bounds. The domestic and international situation is very favorable to us. Just as we once defeated Japanese fascism and French colonialism, our military and people will also defeat American imperialism.

    越南南方民族解放阵线中央主席团发表声明热烈响应胡主席号召
    南越人民同美国侵略强盗不共戴天
    不惜任何牺牲坚决战斗到彻底胜利
    新华社河内二十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团二十日发表声明，热烈响应胡志明主席七月十七日在《告全国同胞书》中向越南全国人民发出的战斗号召，表示越南南方全体人民和解放武装力量决心献出自己的全部物质和精神力量，不惜任何牺牲，不管要付出多大代价，也要完成抗美救国的神圣任务，并且深信必将取得彻底的胜利。声明全文如下：
    一九六六年七月十七日，胡志明主席号召全国同胞和战士坚决推进反对美帝国主义侵略的抗战事业，以保卫北方，解放南方，进而统一祖国。胡主席号召：“为了保卫祖国的独立、为了履行对正在反对美帝国主义的各个民族所承担的义务，我国全民和全军团结一致，不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利”。
    胡主席还颁布了局部动员令，以大力推动抗战事业。
    越南南方民族解放阵线热烈响应胡志明主席——全民族的领袖的号召，它反映了我们全民族的立场、意志和愿望。越南南方民族解放阵线热烈欢迎北方的局部动员令，热烈欢迎北方同胞对我国全民的神圣抗美救国事业所作出的这种新努力。这是对站在抗美斗争最前线的南方同胞的一个极其巨大的鼓舞。
    越南南方民族解放阵线衷心感谢北方同胞对南方的全力支援。全体南方人民和解放武装力量决心献出自己的全部物质和精神力量来完成对祖国所承担的义务：保卫北方、解放南方、统一祖国。这是神圣不可侵犯的义务，是最高的荣誉。南方人民决不惜任何牺牲，不管要付出多大代价，也要完成这一任务。
    美帝国主义正在侵略越南的罪恶战争中越陷越深。它在“特种战争”中遭到了失败，便派出美军和它的帮凶军明目张胆地侵占南方，加紧战争“升级”，破坏北方，甚至袭击河内和海防地区。在南方，它占领了我们祖国的许多城市和土地，使用各种武器残杀我们人民，采取“烧光、杀光、毁光”的焦土政策，不管是在农村还是在城市，不分男女老幼，甚至无知的婴孩，也遭到杀害。在北方，它对医院、学校、工厂和堤坝进行狂轰滥炸，妄图以死亡和破坏来迫使我们人民屈服。在世界上，它极力散布“和平谈判”的论调，妄图欺骗全人类，掩盖它露骨的极其残暴的侵略和好战面目。
    但是，我国人民决不屈服，也决不上帝国主义者的当，多年来，南方人民的仇恨堆积如山，同美国侵略者不共戴天，我们决不会饶恕美国侵略者。即使海枯石烂，当年“决不愿做侵略者的奴隶”的誓言仍深深地铭刻在南方人民的心里，而且随着岁月的消逝，这个誓言更加铮铮作响。南方人民愿与全国同胞一起，即使要战斗五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，也决心把抗美斗争进行到彻底胜利。
    南方人民和全国人民一样，是十分热爱和平的。对于我国人民来说，和平就是意味着没有任何一名美国侵略军和帮凶军留在越南威胁我国人民。这是恢复和平的唯一途径。只要美帝国主义还赖在我国不走，南方人民的抗美斗争就一天也不停止，直到实现独立、民主、进而实现和平为止。
    南方人民和解放武装力量响应胡志明主席的号召，决心努力向北方军民学习，在各个领域里开展立功竞赛，大力推进救国抗战事业。
    南方军民决心更多地消灭和瓦解美军和伪军的有生力量，而目前是在这个雨季的各方面活动中争取最大的胜利。
    南方军民决心克服一切困难、艰苦，在各方面加强自己的力量。踊跃参军、参加民工和青年突击队，为胜利作出贡献。
    南方军民决心保卫和扩大解放区，保卫家乡，大力增加生产，粉碎美国强盗及其走狗的“绥靖”计划。
    南方各城市人民决心广泛地加强团结，建设强大的力量，大力推动反对美帝国主义和走狗伪政权的斗争，争取民族、民主、民生权利，粉碎敌人在城市的统治，随时准备抓紧时机，争取更大的胜利。
    我们军民正在战胜美帝国主义和它的走狗，而且相信必将取得彻底胜利：我们军民的抗战事业正飞跃地发展着。国内和国际局势对我们非常有利。正如过去曾战胜过日本法西斯和法国殖民者一样，我们军民也必将战胜美帝国主义。
