The Australian "Pioneer" Newspaper Calls for Australian Communists and Laborers to Study Mao Zedong Thought
Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism
The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates and guides our revolutionary practice

	New China News Agency, Melbourne, July 9th: The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) organ, the "Pioneer" newspaper, published an article on the 8th, calling on Australian communists and laborers to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The article emphasized that "Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism," and "is the most powerful weapon of the people."

	The article pointed out that today, Mao Zedong Thought is spreading on an unprecedented scale around the world. The article stressed, "Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism," and "Mao Zedong Thought completely conforms to the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism. It provides the people with weapons, enabling them to find the correct path to integrate Marxism-Leninism with the contemporary world. Marx and Engels said that communists despise concealing their goals. In our contemporary era, Mao Zedong clearly pointed out the specific tasks of ending imperialism, oppression, and war—he proudly declared the goals and tasks of communism. These tasks are related to the victory of Marxism-Leninism thought and the path of revolutionary struggle.

	"Ideology is the key issue. With the correct ideology, and when the masses correctly grasp it, victory is assured. This correct ideology is Mao Zedong Thought."

	The article praised Comrade Mao Zedong for clearly pointing out that Marxism-Leninism is universally applicable.

	The article also praised Comrade Mao Zedong for initiating the movement for the masses to grasp Marxism-Leninism. The article said: In this regard, "no one in history can compare to him. The great power of the Chinese people's state is being used to enable the people to grasp Marxism-Leninism, to grasp Mao Zedong Thought."

	When discussing the attacks on Mao Zedong Thought by the bourgeoisie in Australia and other places, the article pointed out: "Of course, the ruling class will attack Mao Zedong Thought because Mao Zedong Thought is precisely the most powerful weapon of the people."

	The article said: "Let these gentlemen mock away. They have always been afraid of the people, but they are doubly afraid of the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

	"Regarding their mockery of Mao Zedong Thought, we can only feel very happy: they are going mad. They are known enemies of the people. If they mock and 'destroy' Mao Zedong Thought, it will most clearly prove the indestructibility and correctness of Mao Zedong Thought.

	"Moreover, this also proves the truth first elucidated by Mao Zedong—the irreconcilable contradiction between Marxism-Leninism and bourgeois ideology. This is just a manifestation of the class struggle in today's world. The viciousness of the attack on Mao Zedong Thought indicates the sharpness of this struggle.

	"The reactionaries are so panic-stricken before Mao Zedong Thought, we must be very happy about this."

	The article said: "Including Australian revisionists, revisionists have participated in the attack on Mao Zedong Thought." "Mao Zedong Thought—even with the help of the bourgeoisie—has become a household name around the world."

	"The crisis of capitalism itself forces the capitalists to attack Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought, due to being attacked, appears even more powerful.

	"No, gentlemen, we will not retreat because of your attacks. On the contrary, we will strengthen our attacks because we are armed with a weapon more powerful than yours—we are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We ask the Australian workers and the Australian laboring people to note that the four-volume collection of Mao Zedong's selected works and single-volume editions are easily available. Please read these works and study them.

	"All Marxist-Leninists will strengthen the study of Mao Zedong's works, making unremitting, systematic efforts to study Mao Zedong's works every day."

	The article called for repeatedly studying Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" as well as other works, and linking them with the specific tasks of Australian Marxist-Leninists. The article emphasized: "A communist, at every moment, is engaged in revolutionary struggle. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates and guides every practice."

	The article said that the Chinese communists are launching an unprecedented movement to enable the Chinese people to grasp Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The article pointed out: "This completely conforms to Marx's famous proposition: 'Theory, once grasped by the masses, also becomes a material force.' They are achieving unprecedented victories. They are sweeping away all obstacles."

	The article finally said: "In Australia, our task must be to enable Marxism-Leninism and contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—to be grasped by the masses. Every Australian communist must learn and relearn Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle. This is a very serious and responsible task."

	Chairman Mao has made immeasurable contributions to the people of the world. Mao Zedong Thought guides the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America on the path to revolution. The image shows the people of Mauritius and some overseas Chinese buying Chairman Mao's works.

    澳《先锋报》号召澳共产党人和劳动人民学习毛泽东思想
    毛泽东思想是当代马列主义的顶峰
    毛泽东思想的光辉照亮和指导我们的革命实践
    新华社墨尔本九日电澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》八日发表文章，号召澳大利亚共产党人和劳动人民学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。文章强调指出：“毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰”，“是人民的最强有力的武器”。
    文章指出，今天，毛泽东思想正以空前的规模在全世界传播。文章强调说，“毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰”，“毛泽东思想完全符合马克思列宁主义的革命原理，它向人民提供了武器，使他们能找到把马克思列宁主义同当代世界结合起来的正确途径。马克思和恩格斯说，共产党人鄙弃掩盖自己的目的。毛泽东在我们当代明确地指出了结束帝国主义、压迫和战争的具体任务——他自豪地宣告了共产主义的目的和任务。这些任务关系到马克思列宁主义思想的胜利和革命斗争的道路。
      “意识形态是关键问题。有了正确的思想，又正确地为群众所掌握，胜利是肯定的。这种正确的思想就是毛泽东思想。”
    文章赞扬毛泽东同志明确地指出了马克思列宁主义是放之四海而皆准的。
    文章还赞扬毛泽东同志开展了群众掌握马克思列宁主义的运动。文章说：在这方面，“全部历史上任何人都比不上他。中国人民的国家的巨大力量，正在用来使人民掌握马克思列宁主义，掌握毛泽东思想。”
    文章谈到澳大利亚及其他地方的资产阶级老爷们攻击毛泽东思想的时候指出：“当然，统治阶级一定会攻击毛泽东思想，因为毛泽东思想正是人民的最强有力的武器。”
    文章说：“让这些老爷们去嘲讽吧。他们一直是害怕人民的，但是他们双倍害怕用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民。
      “对于他们嘲讽毛泽东思想，我们只会觉得非常高兴：他们发疯了。他们是众所周知的人民的敌人。如果他们嘲讽和‘破坏’毛泽东思想，那就最清楚地证明了毛泽东思想的不可摧毁和正确。
      “此外，这也证明了毛泽东首先阐明的真理——马克思列宁主义和资产阶级思想之间的不可调和的矛盾。这只是今天世界上的阶级斗争的表现。对毛泽东思想的进攻的恶毒，表明了这种斗争的尖锐性。
    “反动派在毛泽东思想面前这样惊惶失措，我们必须为此感到非常高兴。”
    文章说：“包括澳大利亚修正主义者在内的修正主义者，参与了对毛泽东思想的进攻。”“毛泽东思想——甚至由于资产阶级的帮助——在全世界已成为一个家喻户晓的字眼。”
      “资本主义的危机本身使资本家不得不攻击毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想由于受到这种攻击而显得威力更加强大。
      “不，老爷们，我们不会因为你们的攻击而退却。相反，我们将加强我们的进攻，因为我们是用比你们的最强有力的武器还厉害的武器武装起来的——我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的。我们请澳大利亚工人和澳大利亚劳动人民注意，毛泽东选集四卷本和单行本很容易买到。请大家阅读这些著作和学习这些著作。
      “所有马克思列宁主义者将加强毛泽东著作的学习，每天不间断、系统地努力学习毛泽东著作。”
    文章号召反复学习毛泽东同志的《实践论》和《矛盾论》以及其他著作，并且使之同澳大利亚的马克思列宁主义者的具体任务联系起来。文章强调说：“一个共产党员，每时每刻都在从事革命斗争。毛泽东思想的光辉在照亮和指导每一项实践。”
    文章说，中国共产党人正在展开一个史无前例的运动，使中国人民都能掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。文章指出：“这完全符合马克思的著名论断：‘理论一经掌握群众，也会变成物质力量。’他们正在取得史无前例的胜利。他们正在横扫一切障碍。”
    文章最后说：“在澳大利亚，我们的任务必须是使马克思列宁主义和当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想——为群众所掌握。每一个澳大利亚共产党员在斗争中必须学习和再学习毛泽东思想。这是一个最严肃和责任重大的任务。”（附图片）
