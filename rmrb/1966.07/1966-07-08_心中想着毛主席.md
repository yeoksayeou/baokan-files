On the day of the earthquake on March 8, the nine-year-old daughter of poor peasant Ma Zixin from Mao'erzai Brigade, Ma Pingguo, was trapped under the rubble. When she was rescued by her mother, she fainted after saying, "Mom, first find Chairman Mao's portrait..." She had bought this portrait of Chairman Mao specially last year. Although Pingguo was young, she knew that Chairman Mao cared deeply about their growth. Chairman Mao's words to the children, "Study hard and make progress every day," she remembered clearly. She loved labor and the collective, and even if she found a single stalk of wheat, she would take it to the production team. Pingguo often heard her grandmother talk about the tragic experiences of her family during the floods in the old society. In the new society, things were different! In 1963, during the great flood, Chairman Mao cared so much for the people in the disaster areas. Pingguo still remembered that at the time, planes dropped many biscuits and bread... Pingguo's family all loved Chairman Mao.

Two days later, a helicopter took Pingguo to another place for treatment. Before boarding the plane, she asked her mother for the portrait of Chairman Mao. Her mother said, "Good child, leave it at home, I will definitely keep it safe for you." A few days later, her mother, thinking of Pingguo's longing for Chairman Mao, entrusted a driver to take the portrait to the hospital. Pingguo saw the portrait while lying in the hospital bed and happily said, "Chairman Mao, I see you again."

The portrait of Chairman Mao gave Pingguo great strength. She fought against her illness with unwavering willpower.

In the hospital, the nurse prepared a slate for her and taught her to write "Long live Chairman Mao!" and to sing "The East Is Red." She also read Chairman Mao's quotations to her. Pingguo was truly Chairman Mao's good child. When the nurse distributed gifts to her, she always asked, "Does grandmother and auntie have them? If not, I don't want them." Once, when Yang Chunni's grandmother coughed all night, Pingguo called the nurse to her side and softly said, "Auntie, take my glucose to make an egg for grandmother." On April 21, Pingguo started walking again and became the "little nurse" in the ward, helping the grandmothers and aunts in her room with water and other needs, assisting everyone.

The story of Ma Pingguo spread. The Dongfeng Primary School Pioneer Brigade Committee in Shijiazhuang City admitted her as a Pioneer member in the hospital ward. Pingguo proudly wore the red scarf.

The day after Pingguo left the hospital and returned home, she insisted on going to work in the fields. Her brother tried to persuade her, "Your body is not well, and you can't do much, don't go." She replied, "If I don't exercise, I won't learn anything." She went anyway.

Now, she has started school. She donated the books given to her to the village cultural room and gave her pencils to other children, saying, "We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and study hard every day."

    心中想着毛主席
    张名
    三月八日地震那天，毛儿寨大队贫农马自新的九岁的女儿马平国被砸在房下，当她被妈妈救出来的时候，她断断续续地说：“妈，你先把毛主席象找出来……”，说着就昏迷过去了。这张毛主席象，是平国去年特意买来的。平国年纪虽小，她知道毛主席十分关心他们的成长，毛主席对小朋友说的话：“好好学习，天天向上”，她记得清清楚楚。她热爱劳动，热爱集体，那怕拾到一棵麦穗也要送到生产队去。平国经常听到奶奶讲，在旧社会闹大水的时候，她家的悲惨遭遇。在新社会就不一样啦！一九六三年闹大水，毛主席对灾区人民是多么关怀。平国还记得，当时从飞机上扔下很多饼干、面包……。平国一家人都热爱毛主席。
    两天后，一架直升飞机把平国送到外地去治疗。临上飞机时，她跟妈妈要那张毛主席象，妈说：“好孩子，就放在咱家里吧，我一定给你保存好。”过了几天，妈妈想到平国对毛主席的思念，就托一位司机，把这张象带到了医院。平国躺在病床上看到了这张象，她高兴地说：“毛主席，我又见到您了。”
    毛主席的象给了平国巨大的力量。她以坚强的毅力，和病痛作斗争。
    在医院里，护士阿姨给她准备了石板，教她写“毛主席万岁！”教她唱《东方红》，给她读毛主席语录。平国真是毛主席的好孩子，护士把慰问品分给她的时候，她总要问：“奶奶、婶婶们全有吗？没有，俺不要。”有一次，杨春妮大娘夜间咳嗽不止，平国把护士叫到身边轻轻地说：“阿姨，把我的葡萄糖拿去给奶奶冲鸡蛋吃吧。”四月二十一日，平国开始下床走路，她就成了病房里的“小护士”，给同房的奶奶、婶婶们端水端尿，帮助大家办事情。
    马平国的事迹传开了，石家庄市东风小学少先队大队委员会，在病房里接收她为少先队队员。平国光荣地戴上了红领巾。
    平国出了医院，到家的第二天，就要下地干活，哥哥劝她，“你的身体不好，也不会干啥，别去了。”她回答：“不锻炼啥也不会。”结果还是去了。
    现在，她已经入学。她把别人赠送给她的书籍送给村里的文化室，把铅笔等送给小朋友们，她说：“我们要听毛主席的话，好好学习，天天向上。”（附图片）
