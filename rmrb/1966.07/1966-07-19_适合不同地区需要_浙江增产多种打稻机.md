	Zhejiang province's industrial sector is actively serving the cause of agricultural mechanization. Recently, it has produced 15,000 threshing machines for rural areas.

	This batch of threshing machines was jointly produced by machine factories in Shangyu, Zhuji, and other places, in collaboration with relevant handicraft cooperatives.

	To ensure that the produced threshing machines are tailored to local conditions and meet the needs of various regions, many factories followed Chairman Mao's directive, "No investigation, no right to speak," and sent personnel to conduct extensive investigations and research in rural areas. Currently, the province produces various types of threshing machines, including foot-operated, electric-powered, single-person, double-person, gear-driven, chain-driven, iron-shelled, and bamboo-shelled models. These machines cater to the needs of different regions and are highly favored by farmers. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　适合不同地区需要
　　浙江增产多种打稻机
    浙江省工业部门积极为实现农业机械化服务，最近又为农村造出一万五千台打稻机。
    这批打稻机是上虞、诸暨等地的机械厂同有关的手工业厂社共同协作生产的。
    为了使生产的打稻机能做到因地制宜，适合各种不同地区的需要，许多工厂遵照毛主席“没有调查就没有发言权”的教导，派人深入农村，进行了大量的调查研究工作。全省目前生产的打稻机就有脚踏的，电动的，单人的，双人的，齿轮传动的，链条传动的，铁皮的和竹壳的等多种不同的规格，适合各种不同地区的需要，深受农民的欢迎。（据新华社讯）
