You shake, I work!
— The bold words of the people of the Xingtai earthquake disaster area

The earthquake cannot topple those armed with Mao Zedong Thought! You shake, I work! Face the difficulties head-on, fight against nature! What we lost at home, we will make up for in the fields! Farmers in the Mao Zedong era dare to fight against the heavens and the earth; the earthquake is just a paper tiger, nothing to be afraid of! Houses may collapse, but our revolutionary will does not; the earth may shake, but our resolve does not waver. You bring water, I will irrigate the fields! You bring more water, I will install pipes and use it as running water! Chairman Mao's heart is with us, no matter how great the difficulties, we are not afraid! We must, with the spirit of Dazhai, the style of Jiao Yulu, and the perseverance of Mai Xiande, overcome all natural disasters.

    你震你的，我干我的！
    ——邢台地震灾区人民的豪言壮语地震，震不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的人！你震你的，我干我的！迎着困难走，战天斗地球！家里丢掉的，要从地里找回来！毛泽东时代的农民，敢同天斗，敢同地斗；地震也不过是纸老虎，没什么了不起！房倒，我们的革命意志不倒；地动，我们的决心不动。你冒水，我浇地！你再冒水，我就安上管子，当自来水用！毛主席的心贴着俺们，有天大的困难，俺们也不怕！要以大寨的精神，焦裕禄的风格，麦贤得的毅力去战胜一切自然灾害。
