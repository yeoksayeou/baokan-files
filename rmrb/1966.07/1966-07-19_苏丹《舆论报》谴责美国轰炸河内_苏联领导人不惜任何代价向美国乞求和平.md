	Sudan's "Public Opinion" Newspaper Condemns U.S. Bombing of Hanoi; Soviet Leaders Beg for Peace at Any Cost

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Khartoum, on the 14th, Sudan's "Public Opinion" Newspaper published a commentary stating that the recent U.S. bombing of Hanoi shows that despite the U.S. sending 300,000 troops to South Vietnam, it has not been able to subdue the Vietnamese people.

	The commentary criticizes the Soviet leaders for begging for peace with the U.S. at any cost.

	The commentary, when discussing Tito and Indira Gandhi's so-called proposal to convene a Geneva conference, said that this proposal is only welcomed by the U.S.

	Sudanese Constituent Assembly member Salah Mahmoud Ismail told the Khartoum News Agency that the U.S. bombing of Hanoi is an escalation of the war in Vietnam, which poses a threat to world peace. He expressed his belief that the Vietnamese people will definitely win.
