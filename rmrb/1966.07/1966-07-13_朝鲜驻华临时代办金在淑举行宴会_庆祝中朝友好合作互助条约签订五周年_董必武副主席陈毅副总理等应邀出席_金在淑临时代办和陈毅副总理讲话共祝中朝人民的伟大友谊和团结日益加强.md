Kim Jae-suk, the Chargé d'Affaires, and Chen Yi, the Vice Premier, both spoke at the banquet, expressing their shared wish for the great friendship and unity between the peoples of China and North Korea to continue to strengthen.

New China News Agency, July 12th: North Korean Chargé d'Affaires Kim Jae-suk held a banquet at the embassy this evening to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-North Korean Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance Treaty.

Vice Chairman Dong Biwu of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the China-North Korea Friendship Association Lin Feng attended the banquet upon invitation.

Kim Jae-suk, the Chargé d'Affaires, and Chen Yi, the Vice Premier, both spoke at the banquet, expressing their shared wish for the great friendship and unity between the peoples of China and North Korea to continue to strengthen. They also jointly condemned the recent U.S. imperialists' continuous bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, and the expansion of the Vietnam War, expressing their full support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

In his speech, Kim Jae-suk said that the Sino-North Korean Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance Treaty has further developed the friendly relations between the peoples of China and North Korea, which were forged in blood. This treaty serves as a serious warning to the U.S. imperialists who are intensifying their policies of aggression and war.

He condemned the U.S. imperialists for continuing to occupy South Korea and for intensifying the formation of the "Northeast Asia Military Alliance" with the revived Japanese imperialists as its backbone, preparing to crazily expand the war of aggression in Asia. He pointed out that the entire process of the recent anti-communist conference in Seoul, held under the direct manipulation of the U.S. imperialists, proves this. This conference is another blatant provocation against the Asian people and the peace-loving people of the world who are fighting for freedom, national independence, peace, and social progress.

Kim Jae-suk said that the friendship, unity, and cooperative relations between the peoples of China and North Korea will continue to develop.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Sino-North Korean Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance Treaty is the crystallization of the long-term, glorious fighting friendship between our two peoples. This treaty embodies our two peoples' common desire to strengthen unity and fight side by side against the U.S. imperialists' policies of aggression and war, and to realize our common great revolutionary ideals. This treaty not only serves the fundamental interests of the peoples of China and North Korea but also serves the interests of the peoples of Asia and the world.

He praised the heroic North Korean people for standing at the forefront of the anti-U.S. struggle, continuously striking at the U.S. imperialists' plots of aggression and war provocations, and making significant contributions to the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

He condemned the U.S. imperialists for continuing to occupy South Korea, directing the South Korean puppet regime of Park Chung-hee to sign the "Korean-Japanese Treaty" with Japanese reactionaries, and actively deploying armed attacks against North Korea and China. He emphasized that all of this is a threat to the North Korean people and also a threat to the Chinese people. The Chinese people, with deep feelings of blood ties with the North Korean people, firmly support the North Korean people's just struggle to force the U.S. aggressor troops to withdraw from South Korea, oppose the "Korean-Japanese Treaty" and other plots of aggression, and strive for the reunification of their motherland. The final victory will surely belong to the heroic North Korean people.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the friendship and unity between the peoples of China and North Korea are based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and are eternal and unbreakable. The Chinese people cherish this friendship and unity and will continue to strive to strengthen it. We are deeply convinced that in the future struggle against imperialism and in the construction of socialism, this friendship and unity between our two peoples will be further consolidated and developed.

Those who attended the banquet upon invitation also included Zhang Siyi, Yang Yong, Wu Xiuquan, Wang Bingnan, Li Qiang, Yang Lin, and other relevant officials.

    新华社十二日讯　朝鲜驻中国大使馆临时代办金在淑，今晚在大使馆举行宴会，庆祝中朝友好合作互助条约签订五周年。
    中华人民共和国副主席董必武，国务院副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长、中朝友好协会会长林枫，应邀出席了宴会。
    金在淑临时代办和陈毅副总理在宴会上先后讲话，共祝中朝两国人民的伟大友谊和团结日益加强。他们还在讲话中一致谴责美帝国主义最近连续轰炸河内和海防、扩大侵越战争的滔天罪行，并且表示全力支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。
    金在淑临时代办在讲话中说，朝中友好合作互助条约使朝中两国人民用鲜血凝成的友好关系得到了进一步发展。这个条约是对加紧推行侵略政策和战争政策的美帝国主义者的严重警告。
    他谴责美帝国主义继续霸占南朝鲜，并且加紧拼凑以复活起来的日本帝国主义为骨干的“东北亚军事联盟”，准备在亚洲疯狂地扩大侵略战争。他指出，最近在美帝国主义直接操纵下召开的汉城反共会议的整个过程证明了这一点，这个会议是对为自由、民族独立、和平与社会进步而斗争的亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民的又一明目张胆的挑衅。
    金在淑临时代办说，朝中两国人民的友谊团结与合作关系将继续发展。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，中朝友好合作互助条约，是我们两国人民长期的、光辉的战斗友谊的结晶。这个条约体现了我们两国人民为反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，为实现我们共同的伟大革命理想，而加强团结、并肩战斗的共同愿望。这个条约不仅符合中朝两国人民的根本利益，而且也符合亚洲和世界各国人民的利益。
    他赞扬英雄的朝鲜人民站在反美斗争的前线，不断打击美帝国主义的侵略阴谋和战争挑衅，为保卫亚洲和世界和平作出了重大贡献。
    他谴责美帝国主义仍然继续霸占着南朝鲜，指使南朝鲜朴正熙傀儡集团同日本反动派签订“韩日条约”，积极部署对朝鲜和中国的武装进攻。他强调说，所有这一切是对朝鲜人民的威胁，也是对中国人民的威胁。中国人民怀着同朝鲜人民血肉相连的深厚感情，坚决支持朝鲜人民迫使美国侵略军撤出南朝鲜、反对“韩日条约”和其他侵略阴谋、争取重新统一祖国的正义斗争，最后胜利一定属于英雄的朝鲜人民。
    陈毅副总理说，中朝两国人民的友谊和团结是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础之上的，是永恒的、牢不可破的。中国人民无限珍视并将不断努力加强这种友谊和团结。我们深信，今后在反对帝国主义和建设社会主义的斗争中，我们两国人民的这种友谊和团结，将会得到进一步的巩固和发展。
    应邀出席宴会的，还有张奚若、杨勇、伍修权、王炳南、李强、杨琳等有关方面负责人。
