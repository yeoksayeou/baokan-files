	Iranian representative Lamin today at the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers said, Asian and African writers should expose the common purpose of the US-Soviet world strategy and clearly point out that the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism is indivisible.

	Lamin talked about the tortuous course of the Iranian people's struggle over half a century, saying that the Iranian people have accumulated valuable experience on this path and have now reached the conclusion that the violent path is the only way for the Iranian people's liberation. Only the blazing fire of the people's war can burn through the rotten chains that enslave them. Therefore, all anti-imperialist and revolutionary forces in Iran are now working hard for this goal.

	He exposed the evil facts of the collusion between US imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism to maintain the reactionary regime in Iran and suppress the revolutionary movement of the Iranian people. He said, the Iranian people have long seen through the base intentions of Soviet revisionist great-power chauvinism. Soviet revisionism has betrayed the Iranian revolution, betrayed the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the revolution, and betrayed all revolutionary forces in Iran. The Iranian people, who have a deep sense of this crime, will never forgive them.

	He said, the Iranian people and writers do not think that the betrayal of the Soviet leadership is limited to Iran, but believe that this is a global policy linked to the global strategic goals of US imperialism.

	He emphasized that the so-called aid from the Soviet Union to Vietnam cannot be compared with the Soviet Union's economic strength. This is no secret to anyone who thinks independently. It is clear that the purpose of this aid is not to truly support the people's war of the Vietnamese people, but to cover up their pale and colorless revisionist policy exposed to the people of the world.

	He said, Asian and African writers should, while exposing the true face of American imperialist warmongers and their accomplices, the modern revisionists, expose the purpose of the US-Soviet world strategy and mobilize the people to oppose US imperialism and modern revisionism.

	Lamin said, the convening of the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers is another fatal blow to the rotten US imperialism and modern revisionism. He pointed out that the split meeting held in Cairo was a farce staged by Soviet revisionists in collusion with some other splitters. However, the protest of Asian and African revolutionary writers has toppled this farce.

    伊朗代表拉明的发言
    新华社一日讯　伊朗代表拉明今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，亚非作家应当揭露美苏世界战略的共同目的，并且应明确地指出反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义的斗争是不可分割的。
    拉明谈到半个世纪来伊朗人民斗争的曲折历程时说，伊朗人民在这条道路上积累了宝贵的经验，现在已经得出了这样一个结论：暴力途径是伊朗人民解放的唯一道路，只有人民战争的熊熊烈火，才能烧断奴役他们的腐朽的锁链。因此，现在一切伊朗反帝和革命的力量都为此而全力以赴。
    他揭露了美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义合谋维护伊朗的反动政权、镇压伊朗人民的革命运动的罪恶事实。他说，伊朗人民早已识破了苏联修正主义大国主义的卑鄙企图，苏联修正主义以自己的所作所为背叛了伊朗的革命，背叛了为革命而献身的烈士，背叛了伊朗的一切革命力量。对这种罪行有切肤之感的伊朗人民，绝不会饶恕他们。
    他说，伊朗人民和作家并不认为苏联领导集团的背叛行为仅仅限于伊朗，而是认为，这是一个同美帝国主义全球战略目标相联系的世界范围的政策。
    他强调指出，苏联对越南的所谓援助不能和苏联的经济力量相比拟，这对于每个有独立思考的人来说，已不是什么秘密了。很清楚，这个援助的目的，不是真支持越南人民的人民战争，而是为了给他们在全世界人民面前暴露出来的苍白失色的修正主义政策涂脂抹粉。
    他说，亚非作家应当在揭露美国帝国主义战争贩子和他们的帮凶现代修正主义者的真面目和戳穿美苏共同阴谋的同时，揭露美苏世界战略的目的，并动员人民反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义。
    拉明说，亚非作家紧急会议的召开，是对腐朽的美帝国主义和现代修正主义的又一个致命的打击。他指出，在开罗召开的分裂会议，是苏联修正主义者伙同另一些分裂主义者合演的一出丑剧。但是，亚非革命作家的抗议声冲垮了这一丑剧。
