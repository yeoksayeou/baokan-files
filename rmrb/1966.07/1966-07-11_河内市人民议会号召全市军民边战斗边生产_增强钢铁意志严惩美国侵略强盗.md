	Hanoi Municipal People's Congress Calls for Production Amidst Combat to Strengthen Resolve and Punish American Aggressors

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 9th – According to reports from here, the third session of the Hanoi Municipal People's Congress held an emergency meeting on the evening of the 8th. The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution calling on the military and civilians of Hanoi to strengthen their iron will to defeat the American aggressors, carry forward the glorious revolutionary fighting traditions of the nation, and the patriotic enthusiasm of the capital's people. They are determined to overcome all difficulties, make any sacrifice, and together with the people of the entire country, complete the glorious cause of resisting America and saving the nation.

	The resolution commends the troops, militia, self-defense forces, and public security personnel of Hanoi for their fierce counterattacks against the invading enemy in recent battles. It also praises the citizens of Hanoi for their calm and brave execution of the people's air defense regulations, closely coordinating with the armed forces to defend the capital.

	The resolution points out that American imperialism is extremely obstinate. It is plotting vicious and despicable schemes. The battles are continuing. The armed forces and semi-armed forces must always maintain a spirit of bravery, tenacity, and decisive victory, consolidate their ranks, improve their tactical techniques, strike hard and accurately, and severely punish the American aggressors invading Hanoi's airspace.

	The resolution points out that the current task of the capital's military and civilians is to fight while producing. We must establish glorious achievements in the battle against the American aggressors; at the same time, we must also achieve victories on the production and construction front. The Hanoi Municipal People's Congress believes that under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government, the people of Hanoi have sufficient strength to defeat the American aggressors and have sufficient strength to complete the construction and production tasks victoriously under any circumstances. The resolution calls on the people of Hanoi to remember their implacable hatred for the American aggressors and to remain highly vigilant against their evil schemes.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 9th – The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 9th, enthusiastically hailing the glorious victory of the heroic Vietnamese People's Navy in Haiphong from July 1st to 7th, where they shot down five American planes, damaged one, and damaged one American warship. The commentary pointed out that although the American aggressors suffered a crushing defeat, they will still stubbornly use many cunning and barbaric schemes and methods. The sailors of the Vietnamese Navy are now hoisting the banner of decisive victory for the Vietnamese people's army, actively conducting tactical and technical training, determined to fight harder and more beautifully, to thoroughly smash all the crazy attacks of the American aggressors.
