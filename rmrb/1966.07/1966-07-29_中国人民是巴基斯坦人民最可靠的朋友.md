Vice Premier Chen Yi reiterates at the banquet welcoming Minister Farouk that the Chinese people are the most reliable friends of the Pakistani people

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and Indian expansionists do not like Sino-Pakistani friendship and are trying to sabotage Sino-Pakistani friendly cooperation. This proves that our development of Sino-Pakistani friendship is correct, in line with the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries, and conducive to consolidating peace in this region. Minister Farouk said that Pakistan cherishes its friendship with China. This friendship has withstood many severe tests and will continue to grow stronger and more consolidated.

Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Vice Premier Chen Yi said at the banquet held this evening to welcome Pakistan's Minister of Commerce, Wulam Farouk, that the Chinese government and people will, as always, firmly support the Pakistani people in safeguarding national independence and firmly support the just struggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination. Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "Pakistani friends can be assured that when you resolutely resist external aggression and threats, we will definitely support you. The Chinese people will forever be the most reliable friends of the Pakistani people."

At tonight's banquet, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Minister Wulam Farouk both delivered warm and friendly speeches. They toasted to the continuous development and consolidation of the friendship between the peoples of the two countries and the friendly cooperation between the two countries.

Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke first at the banquet. He said that the friendly cooperative relationship between China and Pakistan has been developed in the struggle against imperialism and expansionism. The Sino-Pakistani friendship is in line with the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries and has a deep foundation among the peoples of the two countries. The friendly cooperative relationship between the two countries, which enjoys the broad support of the peoples of the two countries, is solid and has been tested.

He said: "Chairman Mao Zedong once said: Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose. U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism do not like Sino-Pakistani friendship, nor do Indian expansionists. They are trying to sabotage the friendly cooperative relationship between our two countries. This proves that our development of Sino-Pakistani friendship is correct, in line with the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries, and conducive to consolidating peace in this region; the U.S. and the Soviet Union are trying every means to plot an Indo-Pakistani alliance against China, which is not beneficial to China and is also harmful to Pakistan. I can confidently say that this plot will not pass among the peoples of our two countries, nor will it pass among the governments of our two countries. The friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan is indestructible by any force."

Vice Premier Chen Yi praised the efforts of the Pakistani government and people, under the leadership of President Ayub Khan, to safeguard national sovereignty and defend against external aggression. He said that the Pakistani people's just struggle against aggression is also a powerful support for the Chinese people.

Vice Premier Chen Yi expressed his belief that, with the joint efforts of the governments and peoples of the two countries, the friendly cooperative relationship between China and Pakistan will continue to be consolidated and developed.

Minister Wulam Farouk said in his speech that the Pakistani government and people cherish their friendship with the Chinese government and people. This friendship has withstood many severe tests. Based on the common interests of the two countries, this friendship will continue to grow stronger and more consolidated in an extremely friendly and mutually understanding atmosphere.

He said: "If our friendship with China causes some people to be uneasy, if they try to drive a wedge between the two countries, then I fully agree with Your Excellency's belief that they will not succeed." Minister Farouk expressed that Pakistan will never forget the generous help and assistance given by China at the time of its national difficulties. He said: "We are not a big country, but a country with dignity and self-respect. We will never oppose our friends, nor will we help our enemies. Your Excellency said that China is a reliable friend of Pakistan. I can assure Your Excellency that Pakistan has the same feelings towards China. We cannot control the actions of others. However, we can definitely control our own behavior. No matter how hard others try to harm our national honor and dignity, we will firmly follow the path we have chosen."

He said: "Our people are always ready to deal with any possible aggression against our country. We believe that through continuous preparation and hard work, we will have enough strength to crush any thoughts of aggression against us in the bud, and such a day will not be far off."

He said: "Pakistan and China do not threaten any country. The eight hundred million people of the two countries are united and determined to defend themselves. This will not only consolidate the peace of the two countries but also consolidate the peace of this region and, to a certain extent, the peace of the world."

Minister Wulam Farouk finally said that there is great potential for cooperation between Pakistan and China, and we should make this cooperation concrete. I assure you that we will do our best on our side.

The speeches of Vice Premier Chen Yi and Minister Farouk were warmly received by the entire audience.

Those who attended the banquet included Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Hanrong, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Li Qiang, China's Ambassador to Pakistan Zhang Wenjin, and other relevant officials.

Pakistan's Ambassador to China Sultan Muhammad Khan and embassy officials were also invited to attend the banquet.

    中国人民是巴基斯坦人民最可靠的朋友
    陈毅副总理说，美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和印度扩张主义者不喜欢中巴友谊，力图破坏中巴友好合作关系。这就证明了我们发展中巴友好，是做得对的，是符合中巴两国人民的根本利益的，是有利于巩固这个地区的和平的。法鲁克部长说，巴基斯坦珍视同中国的友谊。这种友谊已经经受住了许多严峻的考验，并将日益增强和巩固。
    新华社二十八日讯　陈毅副总理今晚在欢迎巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国商业部长吴拉姆·法鲁克的宴会上重申：中国政府和中国人民将一如既往，坚决支持巴基斯坦人民维护民族独立，坚决支持克什米尔人民争取自决权利的正义斗争。陈毅副总理说：“巴基斯坦朋友们可以相信，当你们坚决抵抗外来的侵略和威胁的时候，我们一定支援你们。中国人民永远是巴基斯坦人民最可靠的朋友。”

    陈毅副总理在宴会上首先讲话。他说，中巴两国友好合作关系是在反对帝国主义和扩张主义的斗争中发展起来的。中巴友谊符合两国人民的根本利益，在两国人民中间有着深厚的基础。得到两国人民广泛支持的中巴两国友好合作关系是巩固的，是经过了考验的。
    他说：“毛泽东主席曾说过：凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义不喜欢中巴友谊，印度扩张主义者也不喜欢中巴友谊，它们力图破坏我们两国之间的友好合作关系。这就证明了我们发展中巴友好，是做得对的，是符合中巴两国人民的根本利益的，是有利于巩固这个地区的和平的；美苏正在千方百计地搞印巴联合反华的阴谋，对中国不利，对巴基斯坦也是有损害的。我可以肯定地说，美苏这个阴谋在我们两国人民中是通不过的，在我们两国政府中也是通不过的。中巴两国人民的友谊是任何力量都破坏不了的。”
    陈毅副总理对巴基斯坦政府和人民在阿尤布·汗总统的领导下，为维护国家主权、防御外来侵略所作的努力，表示赞扬。他说，巴基斯坦人民反对侵略的正义斗争，对中国人民也是有力的支持。
    陈毅副总理表示相信，在中巴两国政府和人民的共同努力下，中巴友好合作关系必将继续获得巩固和发展。
    吴拉姆·法鲁克部长在讲话中说，巴基斯坦政府和人民珍视同中国政府和人民的友谊。这种友谊已经经受住了许多严峻的考验。根据我们两国的共同利益，这种友谊将在极为亲切和相互了解的气氛中继续日益增强和巩固。
    他说：“如果巴中友谊引起某些人不安，如果他们试图在两国之间打进一个楔子，那末，我完全同意阁下的信念，即相信他们是不会得逞的。”法鲁克部长表示，巴基斯坦永远忘不了在它民族遭受危难的时刻中国所给予的慷慨的帮助和援助。他说：“我们不是一个大国，但是一个有尊严和自尊心的国家。我们永远不会反对我们的朋友，也永远不会帮助我们的敌人。阁下说，中国是巴基斯坦的可靠朋友。我可以向阁下保证，巴基斯坦对中国完全抱着同样的感情。别人的行动我们管不了。但是，我们肯定能够掌握自己的行为。不管别人如何竭力地想损害我们的民族荣誉和尊严，我们将坚定不移地走自己选定的道路。”
    他说：“我国人民永远准备好对付可能向我国发动的任何侵略。我们相信，由于不断准备和努力工作，我们将有足够的力量把任何侵略我们的念头在萌芽状态就予以摧毁，这样的一天将不会太远了。”
    他说：“巴基斯坦和中国不威胁任何国家。我们两国的八亿人民团结在一起，决心保卫自己。这不仅将巩固我们两国的和平，而且将巩固我们这一地区的和平，并且在一定程度上，巩固全世界的和平。”
    吴拉姆·法鲁克最后说，巴基斯坦和中国之间的合作有很大的余地，我们应该使这种合作具体化。我向你保证，我们方面将为此尽我们的一切努力。
    陈毅副总理和法鲁克部长的讲话，受到全场热烈的欢迎。
