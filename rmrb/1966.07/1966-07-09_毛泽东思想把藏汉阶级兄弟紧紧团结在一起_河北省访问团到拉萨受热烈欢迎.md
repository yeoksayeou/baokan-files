A delegation from Hebei Province was warmly welcomed in Lhasa.

A delegation from Hebei Province arrived in Lhasa on July 6 and was warmly welcomed by more than 7,000 workers and citizens of Lhasa.

The delegation from Hebei Province, representing the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, the Hebei Provincial People's Government, and the 4 million-plus people of Hebei, came to visit the more than 1 million former serfs of Tibet and to donate production and construction materials. The delegation included representatives from the earthquake-stricken areas of Xingtai. The delegation was led by Han Zhenkai, Deputy Director of the Hebei Provincial Financial and Trade Office, and Feng Shiying, Deputy Commissioner of Xingtai Prefecture.

After the earthquake in Xingtai, Hebei Province, the Tibet Autonomous Region sent a delegation to offer condolences and sent a batch of horses to support the earthquake-stricken people. When the Hebei delegation arrived in Lhasa by plane on July 6, officials, students, citizens, handicraft workers, and suburban farmers from Lhasa, carrying bouquets, waving colorful flags, beating cowhide drums, and playing six-stringed lutes, rushed from the streets and alleys to the main streets of Lhasa to welcome them. Leaders from the Tibet Autonomous Region Party, government, and military, including Guo Xilan, Pabala Gelengjie, and Zhao Wenjin, as well as members of the Tibet delegation that had visited Hebei Province, all came to welcome the representatives of the people of Hebei Province.

When the delegation entered the welcoming crowd, Tongzhu, a poor herdsman from Naqu Prefecture who had visited Hebei Province, and Han Zhenkai, the leader of the delegation, embraced each other tightly. Tongzhu said, "You have come from afar to the highlands, and the Tibetan people see you as if they see the millions of class brothers from Hebei Province." Doji, a member of the Qimugang Production Cooperative in Lhasa, excitedly said, "We, the Tibetan and Han class brothers, can gather together because of the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. It is Mao Zedong Thought that tightly unites us class brothers. We must learn from the revolutionary spirit of our Hebei class brothers in studying Chairman Mao's works, firmly walking the socialist road, and learning their revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, striving for progress, developing production, and building our homeland. We will build a socialist new Tibet."

The Hebei delegation will conduct visits and inspections in various parts of Tibet.

    毛泽东思想把藏汉阶级兄弟紧紧团结在一起
    河北省访问团到拉萨受热烈欢迎
    新华社拉萨七日电　前来西藏访问的河北省访问团六日到达拉萨，受到了拉萨七千多名职工和市民群众的热烈欢迎。
    河北省访问团是代表中共河北省委、河北省人民委员会和河北省四千多万人民，前来看望西藏一百多万翻身农奴并向他们赠送生产建设物资的。访问团成员中包括邢台地震灾区的社员代表。访问团由河北省财贸办公室副主任韩振凯、邢台专署专员冯世英率领。
    河北省邢台地区发生地震后，西藏自治区曾派出慰问团前往慰问，并不远万里送去一批马匹支援地震灾区人民。当河北省访问团六日乘飞机到达拉萨时，拉萨的机关干部、学生、市民、手工业工人和市郊农民们拿着花束，打着彩旗，敲着牛皮鼓，弹着六弦琴，从大街小巷涌向拉萨市区的大街上热烈欢迎他们。西藏自治区党、政府、军队的负责人郭锡兰、帕巴拉·格列朗杰、赵文进，以及曾到河北省进行慰问的西藏慰问团成员，都前来欢迎河北省人民的代表。
    访问团进入欢迎人群时，曾到河北省慰问的那曲专区贫苦牧民顿珠和访问团团长韩振凯紧紧地拥抱在一起。顿珠说：你们不远万里到高原来，西藏人民看到你们，就象看到了河北省千千万万的阶级兄弟。拉萨七一铁木生产合作社的社员多吉兴奋地说：“我们藏汉兄弟能团聚一堂，是因为有党和毛主席的英明领导，是毛泽东思想把我们阶级兄弟紧紧地团结在一起。我们要学习河北省阶级兄弟们学习毛主席著作、坚定走社会主义道路的革命精神，学习他们自力更生、奋发图强、发展生产、建设家园的革命精神，来建设好社会主义的新西藏。”
    河北省访问团将在西藏各地进行参观访问。
