The Government of Congo (Brazzaville) Resolutely Suppresses Counter-Revolutionaries
Former Deputy Chief of Staff Plots to Overthrow the Government and is Sentenced to Death

According to Xinhua News Agency, Brazzaville, July 26th - The People's Court of Congo (Brazzaville) announced on July 25th that Felix Muzabakani, the former Deputy Chief of Staff of the National Army, was sentenced to death for "committing crimes endangering national security."

In August 1964, Muzabakani plotted to overthrow the current government of Congo (Brazzaville) by smuggling weapons from Congo (Kinshasa) back into the country. However, all these weapons were discovered by the government and the people of Congo (Brazzaville). Another conspirator, Hyppolite Pongol (who had fled abroad before the plot was uncovered), was sentenced to death in absentia.

Muzabakani's other accomplices were sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment.

During the trial, the presiding judge of the People's Court asked the public, "Do the Congolese people hope that Yulu (the former reactionary president) will return to power?" The public angrily shouted, "No, no!"

The presiding judge pointed out to the public that punishing these subversive elements "is for the victory of the revolution. It is precisely for the interests of the revolution that we must take these decisions in accordance with the will of the Congolese people."

    刚果（布）政府坚决镇压反革命
    前陆军副参谋长阴谋颠覆政府被判处死刑
    据新华社布拉柴维尔二十六日电　刚果（布）人民法庭二十五日在这里宣布，前国家陆军副参谋长费利克斯·穆扎巴卡尼因“犯有危害国家安全的罪行”而被判处死刑。
    穆扎巴卡尼为了阴谋颠覆刚果（布）现政权，在一九六四年八月，从刚果（金沙萨）偷运武器回国。但是，所有这些武器都被刚果（布）政府和群众发现了。另一名阴谋犯希伯尔·庞戈尔（他在阴谋被破获前已逃往国外）被缺席判处死刑。
    穆扎巴卡尼的其他同谋犯被分别判处徒刑。
    在审判的过程中，人民法庭庭长问公众：“刚果人民希望尤卢（前反动政权的总统）重新回来当政吗？”公众愤怒地大声答道：“不，不！”
    人民法庭庭长向公众指出，惩办这些颠覆分子，“是为了革命的胜利，正是为了革命的利益，我们才不得不采取这些符合刚果人民的意愿的决定”。
