	Choe Ryong-Hwa, representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, spoke at the emergency meeting of the Asian-African Writers' Conference today. He expressed support for the report by the Vietnamese representative at this conference. He also condemned the atrocities committed by American imperialism in Vietnam.

	He said, “To the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting, and to the progressive people of the world, the name ‘Vietnam’ has already become a symbol of struggle, a symbol of unparalleled bravery. ‘The people of Asia, Africa, and the entire world, together with the Vietnamese people, must deliver a fatal blow to American imperialism, striking it so hard that it cannot crawl out of the abyss of death, and right on the Vietnamese soil where it started the war, we must strike it down, rendering it helpless.’”

	Choe Ryong-Hwa said, “The current situation demands that the people of the socialist camp, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all the forces of national liberation and peace-loving people in the world unite firmly under the banner of anti-American and anti-imperialism, and launch a worldwide movement to actively support the Vietnamese people both materially and morally.”

	He said, “Based on the experience of the Korean people in the past Korean War against the armed invasion of American imperialism, they fully understand that, no matter how small, aid and support are extremely precious and encouraging to the people in the midst of struggle. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in its statement issued on March 26, 1965, and the decision passed by the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on May 20, 1965, clearly stated that the Korean people will not stand idly by in the face of the aggressive actions of American imperialists in Vietnam, but will provide all forms of assistance, including weapons, to the Vietnamese people. It was also stated that if the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam makes a request, the Korean people will immediately send volunteers to Vietnam.”

	He said, “Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese people. The Korean people fully support the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. We strongly demand that American imperialists immediately stop their aggressive war in Vietnam and immediately withdraw their aggressive troops and instruments of murder from Vietnamese soil.”

	He pointed out, “If the revolutionary people of these three continents unite more closely and fight, we will certainly be able to smash the policy of aggression and war of imperialism and colonialism led by the United States, achieve national independence and liberation, and completely eliminate them from Asia, Africa, and Latin America.”

	He said, “The people of the three continents should mobilize all their strength and direct the spearhead of their struggle against American imperialism.”

	He said, American imperialism has actually turned South Korea into a forward base for aggression and an important supply station for its war in Vietnam. Under the manipulation of American imperialism, the “Ministerial Conference of Asia and the Pacific Region” was held in Seoul, South Korea, aiming to form a single aggressive bloc with Japanese militarism as the backbone, bringing together all its Asian puppet states and lackeys. This is a provocative act that escalates tensions in these regions and threatens world peace.

	He exposed the crimes of cultural imperialism, saying, “Asian and African writers should first concentrate our efforts to frustrate and stop the U.S. aggression against Vietnam.”

	Choe Ryong-Hwa said, “We must firmly unite all anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist forces in the struggle against imperialism, the world's reactionary force, the main force of aggression and war, and the common enemy of humanity.”

    朝鲜代表崔荣化的发言
    新华社二日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表崔荣化今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上发了言。他表示支持越南代表在这个会议上的报告。他还谴责了美帝国主义在越南的暴行。
    他说，“对亚非拉战斗的人民和世界进步的人民来说，‘越南’这个名字已经成为斗争的榜样，已经成为无比英勇的象征。”“亚洲、非洲和全世界人民，同越南人民一道，必须给予美帝国主义致命的打击，打得它无法从死亡的深渊爬出来，而且就在它挑起战火的越南国土上把它打得落花流水，动弹不得。”
    崔荣化说，“当前的局势要求社会主义阵营各国人民，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民以及全世界民族解放斗争和爱好和平的力量，在反美反帝的旗帜下坚定地团结起来，开展一个世界范围的从物资和道义上积极支持越南人民的运动。”
    他说，“根据朝鲜人民自己在过去反对美帝国主义武装侵略的朝鲜战争中的经验，他们充分体会到，援助和支持，不管多么微薄，对于战斗中的人民来说都是非常可贵和令人鼓舞的。”“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在一九六五年三月二十六日发表的声明中和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议在一九六五年五月二十日通过的决定中，都明确表示，朝鲜人民对于美帝国主义者在越南的侵略行为决不会袖手旁观，而要向越南人民提供包括武器在内的一切形式的援助。并且还表示，一旦越南南方民族解放阵线提出要求，朝鲜人民将随时向越南派出志愿人员。”
    他说，“越南是越南人民的。朝鲜人民完全支持越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。”“我们强烈要求美帝国主义者立刻停止他们在越南的侵略战争，立刻从越南的土地上把他们的侵略军队和杀人凶器撤走。”
    他指出：“如果我们这三个大洲的革命人民更加紧密团结，进行斗争，我们一定能够粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略政策和战争政策，赢得民族独立和解放，并从亚非拉把他们完全消灭掉。”
    他说：“我们三大洲的人民应该全力以赴，把斗争的矛头指向美帝国主义。”
    他说，美帝国主义实际上已把南朝鲜变成了一个进行侵略的前哨站和在越南进行战争的一个重要的兵站。在美帝国主义的操纵下，在南朝鲜的汉城举行了“亚洲及太平洋地区部长会议”，打算拼凑一个以日本军国主义为骨干、把它所有的亚洲仆从国家和傀儡联在一起的单一的侵略性集团。这是加剧这些地区的紧张局势、威胁世界和平的挑衅行动。
    他揭露了帝国主义的文化侵略罪行，他说，“亚非作家首先应该集中我们的力量，为挫败和制止美国对越南的侵略而努力。”
    崔荣化说：“我们必须在反对帝国主义这一世界反动势力的头子、侵略和战争的主要势力以及人类共同敌人的斗争中，坚定地团结一切反帝反殖的力量。”
