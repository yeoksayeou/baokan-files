	Shandong's peanuts are growing well this year. As of now, most of the peanuts are in bloom and pegging.

	Shandong is one of the major peanut-producing provinces in China. This year, the province planted more than 80 million mu of peanuts under drought conditions. Through the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, the broad masses of cadres and people have established the idea of farming for revolution, overcoming the drought, and not only completing the timely planting of peanuts but also increasing the area of high-quality seeds by onefold compared to last year. Various levels of leadership attach great importance to peanut production, establishing peanut production leadership teams and sending 1,470 people to live and work in the peanut-producing communes and brigades, setting up demonstration fields, and timely helping the commune members to summarize and promote advanced experiences in cultivating peanuts. To further strengthen the technical guidance of peanut production, in addition to training a batch of technical personnel in each prefecture and county, relevant departments have also hired more than 200 peasant technical personnel from the main peanut-producing area of Yantai and allocated them to various parts of the province.

　　山东花生普遍生长良好
    新华社济南十四日电　山东省今年播种的八百多万亩花生普遍生长良好，现在大部分花生正在开花插针。
    山东省是我国主要花生产区之一。今年，这个省的花生是在干旱的情况下播种的。广大干部和群众通过活学活用毛主席著作，树立了为革命种田的思想，战胜了干旱，不仅适时地完成了花生播种任务，而且使花生的良种面积比去年增加了一倍。各级领导对花生生产都很重视，普遍建立了花生生产领导班子，并派出一千四百七十多人到花生产区的社队蹲点，建立样板田，及时帮助社员总结和推广培育花生的先进经验。为了进一步加强花生生产的技术指导，除各个专区和县训练了一批技术力量外，有关部门还从花生主要产区烟台地区聘请农民技术员二百多人，分配到全省各地。
