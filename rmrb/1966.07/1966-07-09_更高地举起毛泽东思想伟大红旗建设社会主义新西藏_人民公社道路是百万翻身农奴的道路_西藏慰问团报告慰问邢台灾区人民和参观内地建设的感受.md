Members of the Tibet Delegation, who traveled ten thousand miles to support the earthquake-stricken areas of Hebei Province's Xingtai, recently reported to the Tibetan people their experiences visiting Hebei. They said that the path of the people's commune is the path for Tibet's million emancipated serfs.

The delegation members said that during their visit to Hebei, they saw the great superiority of the people's commune and received a profound socialist education. They were particularly inspired by the achievements of the Jianming Commune's Xipu Brigade. Members of the delegation who were emancipated farmers and herdsmen said that the Tibetan people should learn from Wang Guanzhan and the members of the Xipu Brigade to follow Chairman Mao's words and firmly walk the socialist path, resolutely taking the path of the people's commune.

Recently, the delegation members reported in Lhasa and Naqu to cadres, workers, citizens, handicraftsmen, and farmers about their visit to the disaster-stricken areas of Xingtai and their observations in Hebei and other places.

The delegation members said in their report that the greatest gain from this visit to Hebei was bringing back the Party and Chairman Mao's warm concern for Tibet's million emancipated serfs, the revolutionary spirit of the Hebei people, and their deep affection for the Tibetan people, as well as the advanced experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the interior.

They mentioned that the delegation saw with their own eyes how the people in the Xingtai earthquake-stricken areas, under the warm care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with a spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, developed production and rebuilt their homes. The astonishing achievements of the disaster-stricken people in overcoming natural disasters fully proved the Party and Chairman Mao's wise and correct leadership, proved the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, and showed the immense power of the people's commune.

The members talked about their visit to several dozen industrial enterprises in Tianjin and other places, further recognizing the country's unparalleled prosperity and strength. They saw how the working class, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, played a great role in socialist construction. Langco, who was born a serf, said: I must learn from the revolutionary spirit of the worker comrades and actively participate in Tibet's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The delegation's report greatly inspired and educated the people. They expressed their determination to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Hebei people, to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to read Chairman Mao's books, to listen to Chairman Mao's words, to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and to build a good socialist new Tibet.

    据新华社拉萨八日电  万里送马支援河北省邢台地震灾区的西藏慰问团团员，最近向西藏人民报告他们访问河北的收获时说，人民公社的道路是西藏百万翻身农奴的道路。
    慰问团团员们说，他们在河北参观时看到了人民公社的巨大优越性，受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育。他们特别对建明公社西铺大队的成就感到鼓舞。团员中的翻身农牧民们说，西藏人民要学习王国藩和西铺大队社员们听毛主席的话，坚持走社会主义道路的革命精神，坚决走人民公社的道路。
    慰问团团员们最近在拉萨和那曲等地向机关干部、工人、市民、手工业工人和农民报告他们慰问河北邢台灾区阶级兄弟和在河北等地参观的情况。
    慰问团团员们在报告中说，他们这次到河北慰问，最大的收获是带回了党和毛主席对西藏百万翻身农奴的亲切关怀，带回了河北人民的革命精神和对西藏人民的深情厚谊，带回了内地人民活学活用毛主席著作的先进经验。
    他们谈到，慰问团在邢台地震灾区亲眼看到人民群众在党中央和毛主席的亲切关怀下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神来发展生产，重建家园。灾区人民战胜自然灾害的惊人成就，充分证明了党和毛主席英明、正确的领导，证明了社会主义制度的无比优越，显示了人民公社的威力无比强大。
    团员们在报告中谈到，他们在天津等地参观了几十个工业企业后，更加认识到祖国无比繁荣富强，看到了工人阶级高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在社会主义建设中发挥了伟大的作用。农奴出身的朗措说：我一定要学习工人老大哥的革命精神，积极参加西藏的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    慰问团的报告使人们受到极大的鼓舞和教育。他们表示一定要学习河北人民的革命精神，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，建设好社会主义的新西藏。
