The editorial board of Xinhua News Agency notes: Mao Zedong Thought is our political direction, the highest directive for our actions, and the telescope and microscope for observing and analyzing everything. A recent issue of a philosophy wall newspaper from a reconnaissance platoon of the Nanjing Military Region illustrates that revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought not only can take up arms to smash the old world and seize power, using the gun to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, but also can take up the pen, charge into battle, and vanquish all ghosts and monsters, thoroughly eliminating all the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits used by the exploiting classes to poison the people.

The philosophy wall newspaper from the reconnaissance platoon also shows that revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, most intelligent, most steadfast, and most perceptive. They write excellent articles that are clear, profound, vivid, and powerful. Those bourgeois "authorities" who slander the workers, peasants, and soldiers for studying Chairman Mao's works as "vulgarization," "simplification," and "pragmatism" could never write such good articles or speak such profound philosophy. The era of workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering theory has begun, and the era of bourgeois "authorities" monopolizing theory, culture, and science is gone forever.

Here, we present four articles from the recent issue of the philosophy wall newspaper from the reconnaissance platoon for everyone to read.

**“Sudden” or Inevitable?**

Class Leader Chen Xuezheng (Five-Good Soldier)

In the high tide of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, those who have secretly occupied leading positions within the Party have been exposed one by one. This happened sixteen years after liberation. Is it "sudden" or not? I pondered this question while studying "On New Democracy." Chairman Mao pointed out: "Revolutionary culture, before the revolution, is the ideological preparation for the revolution; during the revolution, it is a necessary and important front in the general revolutionary line." From this teaching of Chairman Mao, I understood: Reactionary culture is also preparing the ideological ground for the counterrevolutionary restoration. For sixteen years, the representatives of the bourgeoisie have never relaxed in this preparation. The class struggle on the cultural front has never stopped, not for a single year, month, or day. It is one struggle after another, each struggle deeper than the last. Sometimes the waves are lower, sometimes higher, sometimes more hidden, sometimes more obvious. All ghosts and monsters, like all reactionaries in the world, will not deviate from the logic of causing trouble, failing, causing more trouble, failing again, until they are destroyed. How they rebel, how we fight back—this is determined by the laws of class struggle. Since this is the case, the enemy without guns uses both soft and hard tactics, infiltrating and setting up bases within us, raising "red flags" to open black dens. What is so "sudden" about this?

Dialectics tells us: The movement of all things is relative stillness and obvious change. The class struggle in the realm of ideology is the same: When the class enemy is feigning obedience while preparing black dens, it is in a state of relative "stillness"; when the black dens open and these ghosts and monsters all come out, it reaches a state of obvious change. In fact, obvious change is the inevitable result of relative stillness. Some "authorities" taking off their shirts to fight is the result of their long-term "sharpening of the knife." It seems still, but it is not still. This is motion within stillness and stillness within motion. As long as we understand and grasp the laws of class struggle, we can use the inevitable to counter the "sudden," see the turmoil from the "calm," and remain composed even if the sky falls.

**Destruction and Construction**

Deputy Class Leader Cai Youming (Rice Cultivation Expert)

The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has seized the ideological and cultural positions occupied by the representatives of the bourgeoisie. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers all applaud: "Destroyed well!" But at this moment, some bourgeois "authorities" come out and shout about "construct first, then destroy" and "both construct and destroy." What is this about? After reading Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy," the problem is clear: "...Reactionary culture serves imperialism and the feudal class and should be overthrown. Without overthrowing these things, no new culture can be established. No destruction, no construction; no blocking, no flow; no stopping, no going. Their struggle is a life-and-death struggle." Here, Chairman Mao teaches us an important philosophical principle: Destruction first, construction within. Isn't this the case? Without destroying reactionary culture, revolutionary new culture cannot be established; without destroying bourgeois and revisionist culture, proletarian and socialist culture cannot be established. For example, our platoon engages in amateur production and rice cultivation. Every year, we must fiercely fight against a weed called barnyard grass to ensure a bumper harvest. Once the barnyard grass grows, the rice yield decreases. It is like this: Barnyard grass sprouts, the land is poor and the seedlings are yellow; pull out the barnyard grass, the land is rich and the seedlings are strong. The relationship between proletarian thought and bourgeois thought is the same as that between rice seedlings and barnyard grass—it is a struggle to the death. Those bourgeois lords who advocate "construct first" and the likes of Deng Tuo who promote "blocking is not as good as guiding" are all of the same ilk. Their so-called "construct first" is to establish the black line of the bourgeoisie against the Party and socialism; their so-called "guiding" is to open the floodgates and let the bourgeois filth flow in, muddying the clear water of the proletariat. Their true purpose is to tie the hands of the revolutionary people, not allowing them to destroy bourgeois thought, and to preserve the capitalist position, obstructing the rooting of Mao Zedong Thought, so that they can continue to lord it over the workers, peasants, and soldiers, waiting for the opportunity to carry out a counterrevolutionary restoration. This is a poisonous plan. The workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought not only will not be deceived but will also, like eradicating barnyard grass, uproot these representatives of the bourgeoisie.

Destruction and construction are opposed and also united. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. To destroy, one must reason, and reasoning is construction. As long as destruction comes first, construction will be within. The old must be destroyed for the new to be constructed, just as barnyard grass must be removed for the rice seedlings to be strong. The more thoroughly bourgeois thought is destroyed, the more firmly proletarian thought is established. Revolution is to destroy the old world and build the new world. We must be the "demolition experts" who blow up the old world and the "thousand-jin clubs" who smash the palace of the bourgeoisie's king, defeating all the ghosts and monsters, both open and hidden, domestic and foreign, making them fall like flowers and leaves, sweeping them all away. Only in this way can we build a brilliant new world of the proletariat!

**Turning It Over Again**

Cooking Staff Member Jie Dengshi (Five-Good Soldier)

Before the Cultural Revolution, the stage, screen, and other cultural positions were occupied by bourgeois "authority" lords, filled with emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, masters, mistresses, young masters, young ladies, foreigners, and corpses, while we, the workers and peasants who create history, did not even have a place to stand. Is this not strange?

It is strange, and it is not strange. These bourgeois "authority" lords, although they eat the people's food and wear the people's clothes, do nothing but anti-Party and anti-people deeds. To prepare public opinion for counterrevolutionary restoration, they must elevate the feudal ruling class to the ninth heaven and push the workers and peasants into the eighteenth layer of hell, completely distorting history. But they misjudged the timetable—now is not the time for them to distort history at will. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we workers and peasants have already stood up politically. Standing up means standing up completely! We must be the masters in politics and economics, and also the masters of the stage, newspapers, and all cultural domains. We not only must be the masters of real life but also the masters of history. Now is the time for us workers and peasants to turn history over again. We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, overturning the history distorted by the exploiting classes and restoring the true face of history. Take our work as cooks, for example: In the old society, we were called "servants" by the lords. Now, cooking work has become a glorious position serving the people. We have read Chairman Mao's books and understand that "one ladle handle, two worldviews." We treat the five-foot stove as the frontline of the struggle to promote revolution and eliminate capitalism, standing by the stove, seeing the whole world, using dialectics to guide our cooking, and creating a five-good canteen. Our platoon leader, Gu Faxiang, wrote an article about making revolution in the kitchen, which was published in the central Party's theoretical journal, "Red Flag." We workers and peasants have always been the main force of the revolution. Today, in this Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we must be the vanguard, leading the charge, and launching a fierce attack on the bourgeois "authority" lords, smashing their monopoly "power" to smithereens!

Turning over and turning over again are opposed. Where there is opposition, there is struggle. We must turn over the history that has been turned over, inevitably facing the fierce counterattack and stubborn resistance of the bourgeoisie and their representatives. This life-and-death struggle is unavoidable. There is only one way: struggle! Without struggle, the authority lords' prestige cannot be broken; without struggle, the positions occupied by the authority lords cannot be seized back; without struggle, the distorted history cannot be turned over again. In the past, they sat on the "authority" throne, baring their fangs and brandishing their claws. Today, we must knock them down and step on them. In short, everything distorted by the bourgeois "authority" lords, we must all "turn over again" today. We, the hundreds of millions of workers and peasants, must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of "turning over again" and, in this struggle of "turning over again," write a new history of revolution!

**Fighting at All Times and Persisting in the Fight**

Soldier Jin Zhongxi (Climbing Expert)

Chairman Mao teaches us that the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the realm of ideology is long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense. The question of who will win between socialism and capitalism will take a hundred to several hundred years to resolve. Following this viewpoint to observe the current situation of the Cultural Revolution, we will not be satisfied with the current victory and will more consciously engage in this political and ideological protracted war.

The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview. This is not subject to the will of people. The class struggle on the cultural front over the sixteen years since liberation proves: The bourgeois nature of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements will not be reflected and will not manifest. Eliminating one black line, there will be a new black line; destroying one "Three-Family Village," there may be a "Four-Family Shop" in the future. Therefore, we must use the class struggle viewpoint taught by Chairman Mao to observe, analyze, and deal with everything, never forgetting class struggle, never forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forgetting to emphasize politics, and never forgetting to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. See a weed and uproot it; see a ghost and monster and overthrow it; participate in the struggle to criticize the bourgeoisie at all times. Do not think that smashing a few anti-Party cliques and exposing a few anti-Party elements means everything is fine and done forever; do not fight for a while and then relax, but persist unremittingly and fight to the end. This is like our reconnaissance soldiers climbing steep cliffs—one cannot relax, one cannot stop, and one must climb more firmly step by step to reach the summit and trample the mountain underfoot. Whoever relaxes their fighting spirit in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat will be as dangerous as letting go halfway up the mountain!

From this, I further understand: In the realm of ideology, like everything in the world, contradictions exist from beginning to end. Old contradictions are resolved, and new contradictions arise. As long as there are classes, class struggle will not end; as long as there are two opposing ideologies, their life-and-death struggle will not end. It is this struggle that promotes the forward development of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Therefore, contradictions are the world, and struggle is life. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching, "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage than to seek fame by learning from the King of Chu." We must fight the bourgeois ideology for a long time, fighting every day, every year, for a lifetime, and the next generation will also fight. We will not stop fighting until the day classes and class struggle are eliminated!

    在阶级斗争中掌握毛主席哲学思想
    ——介绍南京部队某部侦察连在文化大革命中出的一期哲学墙报
    新华社编者按：毛泽东思想是我们的政治方向，是我们行动的最高指示，是我们观察和分析一切事物的思想上政治上的望远镜和显微镜。南京部队某部侦察连最近出的一期哲学墙报说明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，不仅能拿起枪杆子，打破旧世界，夺取政权，用枪杆子保卫无产阶级专政，而且完全能够拿起笔杆子，冲锋陷阵，讨伐一切牛鬼蛇神，彻底破除一切剥削阶级用来毒害人民的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。
    侦察连的哲学墙报还说明：毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士最勇敢，最聪明，立场最坚定，眼光最锐利，文章写得好，鲜明、透彻、生动、有力。那些污蔑工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作是“庸俗化”“简单化”“实用主义”的资产阶级“权威”们，他们是万万写不出这样的好文章，讲不出这样的活哲学。工农兵掌握理论的新时代开始了，资产阶级“权威”们垄断理论、文化、科学的时代一去不复返了。
    这里，我们从侦察连最近出的一期哲学墙报中，选出四篇，介绍给大家。
    “突然”还是必然？
     班长　陈学政（五好战士）
    在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，钻在党内窃据领导职位的资产阶级代表人物一个一个被揪了出来。事情发生在解放十六年以后的今天，是“突然”呢，还是并不突然呢？我带着这个问题请教了《新民主主义论》。毛主席指出：“革命文化，在革命前，是革命的思想准备；在革命中，是革命总战线中的一条必要和重要的战线。”从毛主席的这一教导里，我领悟到：反革命的文化，同样也是为反革命复辟作思想准备的。十六年来，资产阶级的代表人物从没有放松过这种准备；文化战线上的阶级斗争，没有哪一年、哪一月、哪一天停止过，真是一场斗争接着一场斗争，一次斗争比一次更深入。只不过是有时浪头低些，有时浪头高些，有时比较隐蔽，有时比较明显罢了。一切牛鬼蛇神，也和世界上一切反动派一样，是决不会违背捣乱、失败、再捣乱、再失败，直至灭亡这个逻辑的。他们怎么反，我们怎么斗，这是阶级斗争的规律所决定的。既然这样，不拿枪的敌人对我们软硬兼施，打进来，拉出去，钻在我们内部设据点，打起“红旗”开黑店，又有什么“突然”呢？
    辩证法告诉我们：一切事物的运动，无不采取相对静止和显著变动的状态。意识形态方面的阶级斗争也是这样：当着阶级敌人阳奉阴违，筹备黑店的时候，处在相对“静止”的状态；当着黑店开张，这伙牛鬼蛇神一齐出笼的时候，就达到显著变动的状态。实际上，显著的变动正是相对静止的必然结果。某些“权威”赤膊上阵，正是他们长期“磨刀”的结果。好象静止，并不静止，这就是动中有静，静中有动。只要我们认识和掌握了阶级斗争的规律，就能以必然对付“突然”，从“平静”看到动荡，哪怕是天塌下来也能做到“乱云飞渡仍从容”。
    破和立
    副班长　蔡友明（种水稻能手）
    无产阶级文化大革命，夺取了资产阶级代表人物霸占的思想文化阵地。广大工农兵莫不拍手欢呼：破得好！可就在这个时候，某些资产阶级“权威”却出来咋呼什么“先立后破”“有立有破”。这是怎么一回事呢？读了毛主席《新民主主义论》，问题就清清楚楚了：“……反动文化是替帝国主义和封建阶级服务的，是应该被打倒的东西。不把这种东西打倒，什么新文化都是建立不起来的。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，它们之间的斗争是生死斗争。”毛主席在这里教导我们一个十分重要的哲学道理：破字当头，立也就在其中了。事实不正是这样吗：反动文化不破，革命的新文化就建立不起来；资产阶级的、修正主义的文化不破，无产阶级的、社会主义的文化就建立不起来。好比我们连搞业余生产种水稻，每年都得跟一种叫稗草的坏家伙狠斗，才能保丰收；稗草一滋长，水稻就减产。正是：稗草冒尖，地瘦苗黄；拔掉稗草，地肥苗壮。无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的关系，也跟稻苗和稗草的关系一样，是势不两立的，不是你打倒它，就是它打倒你。叫喊“先立后破”的资产阶级老爷，鼓吹“堵塞不如开导”的邓拓之流，都是一路货色。他们所说的“先立”，就是要立资产阶级反党反社会主义的黑线；他们所说的“开导”，就是要我们打开闸门，放出资产阶级的浊流，搞浑无产阶级的清水。他们的真正目的：就是要捆住革命人民的手脚，不准破资产阶级思想，妄想保住资本主义的阵地，阻挠毛泽东思想扎根，让他们照旧对工农兵耀武扬威，以便等待时机，实现反革命复辟。这是一条毒计。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵不但绝不会上当，而且要象清除稗草一样把这伙资产阶级代表人物连根拔掉。
    破和立是对立的，也是统一的。破，就是批判，就是革命。破就要讲道理，讲道理就是立。只要破字当头，必能立在其中。旧的不破，新的不立，正似稗草不去，禾苗不壮。资产阶级思想破得越彻底，无产阶级思想立得越牢靠。革命就是要破坏旧世界，就是要建设新世界。我们就是要当炸毁旧世界的“爆破手”，当砸烂资产阶级阎王殿的“千钧棒”，把一切明的、暗的、“红”的、黑的、国内的、国外的牛鬼蛇神统统打个落花流水，统统扫除干净，只有这样，才能建立起无产阶级灿烂的新世界！
    再颠倒过来
    炊事员　解登示（五好战士）
    在文化大革命以前，舞台、银幕等等文化阵地被资产阶级“权威”老爷们霸占着，满台帝王将相、才子佳人、老爷太太、少爷小姐、洋人死人，而我们创造历史的工农兵却连站脚的地方也没有，这不是十分奇怪的事吗？
    是怪，也不怪。这帮资产阶级“权威”老爷，虽然吃人民的饭，穿人民的衣，干的却尽是反党反人民的勾当。他们为了给反革命复辟作好舆论准备，必定要把封建统治阶级捧上九重天，把工农兵群众打下十八层地狱，必定要把历史完全弄颠倒。但是他们看错了时间表——现在不是他们任意把历史怎么颠倒就怎么颠倒的时代了。我们工农兵群众在党和毛主席的领导下，已经在政治上翻了身。翻身就要翻个彻底！我们要做政治上、经济上的主人，也要做舞台的主人，做报刊的主人，做一切文化领域的主人。我们不仅要做现实生活的主人，还要做历史的主人。现在是我们工农兵起来把历史再颠倒过来的时候了。我们一定要坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，把剥削阶级颠倒了的历史再颠倒过来，恢复历史的真面目。拿我们炊事员的工作来说吧：在旧社会我们被老爷们唤作“伙伕”。现在炊事工作成了为人民服务的光荣岗位。我们读了毛主席的书，认识到“一根锅铲柄，两种世界观”。把五尺锅台当成兴无灭资的前沿阵地，站在锅台边，看到全世界，用辩证法指导我们烧火做饭，创造五好食堂。我们班长顾发祥写出了在炊事房里闹革命的文章，还登上了党中央的理论刊物《红旗》杂志。我们工农兵群众，向来是革命的主力军。今天，在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，我们更要当先锋，打头阵，向资产阶级“权威”老爷们猛烈开火，把他们的垄断“权”，砸个稀巴烂！
    颠倒和再颠倒是对立的。有对立就有斗争。我们要把颠倒了的历史再颠倒过来，必然要遭到资产阶级和他们的代表人物的疯狂反扑和顽强抵抗。这场水火不相容的斗争，你想躲也躲不掉，想避也避不开。只有一条路可走：斗！不斗，“权威”老爷的威风打不掉；不斗，被“权威”老爷占去的地盘夺不回；不斗，被颠倒了的历史就颠倒不过来。过去，他们盘踞在“权威”宝座上，张牙舞爪，今天我们要把他们打翻在地下，再踏上一只脚。总之，一切被资产阶级“权威”老爷弄颠倒了的东西，今天我们都要统统地“再颠倒”过来。我们亿万工农兵群众一定要发扬“再颠倒”的革命精神，在这场“再颠倒”的斗争中，写出革命的新历史来！
    随时斗和坚持斗
    战士　金忠喜（攀登能手）
    毛主席教导我们，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的，社会主义和资本主义谁胜谁负的问题，需要一百年到几百年的时间才能解决。遵照这个观点来观察当前文化大革命的形势，我们就会不满足眼前的胜利，就会更自觉地去打这场政治思想上的持久战。
    无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界，这是不依人们的意志为转移的。解放十六年来文化战线的阶级斗争证明：要反党反社会主义分子的资产阶级本性不反映，不表现出来，是不可能的。搞掉了一条黑线，还会有新的黑线；捣毁了一个“三家村”，将来也可能出现一个“四家店”。因此，我们一定要用毛主席教给我们的阶级斗争观点观察一切，分析一切，对待一切，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，见到毒草就铲除，见到牛鬼蛇神就打倒，随时参加批判资产阶级的斗争。决不要以为粉碎了几个反党集团，揪出了一撮反党分子就万事大吉，一劳永逸了；决不能斗一阵，松一阵，而是要坚持不懈，斗争到底。这正象我们侦察兵攀登悬崖陡壁那样，一气不能松，一脚不能停，一步比一步更坚定地往上攀登，才能到达顶峰，把高山踩在脚底下。谁要是在无产阶级文化大革命中松懈斗志，就会跟攀登途中在半山腰上松手一样危险！
    从这里我进一步体会到：在意识形态方面，也跟世上一切事物的发展过程一样，自始至终存在着矛盾。旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又出现了。有阶级存在，阶级斗争就不会完结，有两种互相对立的思想意识存在，它们之间的殊死搏斗就不会完结。正是这种斗争，推动着无产阶级革命事业向前发展。因此，矛盾就是世界，斗争就是生活，我们一定要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”。跟资产阶级思想长期斗下去，天天斗，年年斗，一辈子都斗，下一代也斗，不斗到阶级和阶级斗争消灭那一天，决不收兵！
