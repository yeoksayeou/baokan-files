The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines in every corner of the world, attracting the hearts of people from various countries. In France, people from New China have deeply felt this through their interactions with French revolutionary people and revolutionary people from other countries residing in France: they love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

Once, a Chinese youth was talking with several French workers about Chairman Mao and naturally said, “Our Chairman Mao…” Unexpectedly, an elderly French woman immediately interrupted him, expressing her disagreement by saying, “Why do you say Chairman Mao is only yours? You should say, our Chairman Mao.”

Such instances are countless. Another Chinese youth had a similar experience. When he said, “Chairman Mao is our great helmsman,” an African friend immediately corrected him by saying, “He is not just your great helmsman, but the great helmsman of the world’s people.”

At a bus stop, you might encounter a French worker you don’t know, who smiles at you. Seeing that you come from New China, he raises his thumb and says, “Long live Chairman Mao!” Once, a Latin American student in Paris saw Chinese people on the underground electric train and followed them off the train, chasing them out of the subway station for a long distance to ask for a Chairman Mao badge.

In Lyon, a French mechanic asked a Chinese person for a Chairman Mao badge. At that time, the Chinese person did not have one on him. So, he asked for the address and went to the Chinese person’s residence the following Sunday to get the badge. Another time, a French worker asked a Chinese student for a Chairman Mao badge. The Chinese student apologized, saying he did not have one on him, but could give him another badge. The French worker said, “No, I want a Chairman Mao badge because I love him.”

At the Paris Expo in May, many French people either verbally or through written messages asked the staff of the Chinese pavilion to convey their respects and greetings to Chairman Mao, wishing Chairman Mao good health and longevity. The Chinese staff told them that Chairman Mao was in good health, and they were very happy, showing satisfied smiles.

French revolutionary people love Chairman Mao because they recognize that Chairman Mao is the contemporary Lenin, the great leader guiding the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed people worldwide. An old worker said, “Today’s China is the hope of the oppressed people of the world. The leaders of the Soviet Union have become revisionists. Those who want revolution are all looking at China.” He also encouraged Chinese youth, saying, “Your generation has not suffered, has not experienced the trials of revolutionary war, but you must listen to Chairman Mao’s words, hold the torch of revolution to the end, and light the way for the people of the world.”

A French friend, Roger, sent a poem praising Chairman Mao, in which he wrote passionately, “Glory belongs to you, the brave supporter of noble causes! The peoples of various countries, bound by the ugly net, tell you of their suffering. May you live long, the renovator of people’s hearts.”

This friend also wrote humbly in the accompanying letter, “I know my verses are of little value. But I only hope that you see in the poem my love for your great country, my boundless respect for your Chairman Mao Zedong… I cannot find a better way to express my admiration… I hope you can understand: just like me, a person can be born in Paris and have a Chinese heart.”

An African student said, “I have great admiration for China. China has produced Mao Zedong, who has united seven hundred million Chinese people to strive for a common goal. This is something that many African countries have not achieved, and it is what we admire and yearn for.”

Foreign friends understand that the revolutionary people of China are educated by the great Mao Zedong Thought, so whenever they see commendable qualities in people from New China, they are even more inspired to love Chairman Mao. Many people praise the diplomatic personnel of New China for treating people equally and being kind to the working people. They say, “People from the country of Mao Zedong are indeed different!” A female cleaner was deeply impressed by the Chinese students’ love for labor. When she learned that it was Chairman Mao who taught the young students to love labor and to combine with workers and peasants, she said emotionally, “Chairman Mao is truly wise!” The youth of New China are full of revolutionary spirit, which also earned the praise of many French students. A French female university student said to a Chinese student, “You young people in New China are truly fortunate, living in the era of Mao Zedong. Whenever you talk about your country, you are full of confidence and pride, showing your love for your country and people.” In France, as in other countries, revolutionary people are diligently studying the works of Chairman Mao, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. In a university in Paris and other places in France, some friends have organized study groups for the works of Chairman Mao. A female university student said, “Our group insists on studying the ‘Selected Works of Mao Zedong.’ Especially for ‘On Contradiction,’ we study it repeatedly, word by word, and this article brings us great strength.” Another university student who is self-studying Chinese said that he studies Chinese because the great Chinese revolution attracts him, and learning Chinese well allows him to directly study the works of Chairman Mao and better understand Mao Zedong’s revolutionary theory.

Some Western newspapers attack Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. At this time, foreign friends stand with the Chinese people, expressing indignation and condemning them. A French young woman said, “Western newspapers constantly mock the Chinese people for learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They ridicule the Chinese for applying Mao Zedong Thought in things like ‘selling watermelons’ and ‘playing table tennis.’ But what do they understand? I think it is a great and profound thing for the ordinary masses to study philosophy and apply it, something that has never happened in human history.”

### 革命人民热爱毛主席热爱毛泽东思想

　　革命人民热爱毛主席热爱毛泽东思想
    毛泽东思想的光辉照射到世界的每个角落，吸引着各国人民的心。在法国的新中国人民，从自己同法国革命人民以及居住在法国的外国革命人民的接触中，都深深感到这一点：他们热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想。
    有一次，一个中国青年在同几个法国劳动者谈起毛主席时，很自然地说：“我们的毛主席……”不料，一位法国老太太立刻打断了他的话，提出异议说：“你为什么把毛主席说成只是你们的呢？你应当说，我们大家的毛主席。”
    这样的事例不胜枚举。另一个中国青年也有过类似的经历。当他说“毛主席是我们伟大的舵手”时，一位黑非洲朋友立刻纠正说：“他不仅是你们的伟大舵手，也是世界人民的伟大舵手。”
    在公共汽车站上，你会碰到一个素不相识的法国工人向你微笑。他看出你来自新中国，就一面竖起大拇指，一面说：“毛主席万岁！”有一次，一个拉丁美洲学生在巴黎地下电气火车上看见了中国人，就跟着他们下了车，追出地下铁道站很远，向他们要一枚毛主席纪念章。
    在里昂，一个法国机械工人向中国人要毛主席纪念章。当时这个中国人身上没有带。于是，他就问好了地址，下个星期日专门到这个中国人的住所去取纪念章。另一次，一个法国工人向中国留学生要一枚毛主席的纪念章。中国留学生向他抱歉地表示身上没有带，但可以先送给他一枚别的纪念章。这个法国工人说：“不，我就要毛主席的纪念章，因为我热爱他。”
    在五月举行的巴黎博览会上，许多法国人口头或者留言要求中国馆的工作人员代他们向毛主席致敬和问候，祝毛主席健康长寿。中国工作人员告诉他们毛主席身体很健康，他们就非常高兴，露出了满意的笑容。
    在法国的革命人民热爱毛主席，因为他们认识到，毛主席是当代的列宁，是领导全世界被压迫人民坚持革命斗争的伟大旗手。一个老工人说：“今天的中国是世界上受压迫人民的希望。苏联领导人已经变成修正主义者了。要革命的人都注视着中国。”他还勉励中国青年说：“你们这一代年青人没有受过苦，没有经历过革命战争的考验，可是你们一定要听毛主席的话，把革命火炬举到底，给世界人民照亮道路。”
    法国朋友罗歇寄来了歌颂毛主席的诗，他在诗中热情洋溢地写道：“光荣属于你，美好事业的勇敢的支持者！被丑恶的罗网束缚住的各国人民，向你诉说折磨他们的苦难。愿你万岁，人们心灵的革新者。”
    这位朋友还在附来的信中谦逊地写道：“我知道我的诗句没有多少价值。但是我只希望你们在诗里看到我对你们伟大国家的热爱，看到我对你们的毛泽东主席的无比尊敬。……我找不到更好的方法来表达我的敬佩心情。……但愿你们能了解：就象我这样，一个人可以生在巴黎而有着一颗中国人的心。”
    一个非洲留学生说：“我对中国充满了敬佩之情。中国出了毛泽东，他把七亿中国人都团结起来，为了共同的目标而奋斗。这正是今天许多非洲国家没有做到的，是我们所羡慕而渴望的。”
    外国朋友们懂得，中国革命人民是伟大的毛泽东思想教导出来的，因此，每当他们在来自新中国的人的身上看到了值得赞扬的品质时，就更加激发了他们对毛主席的热爱。许多人赞扬新中国的外交人员平等待人，对劳动人民和蔼可亲，他们说：来自毛泽东的国家的人，品质毕竟不同！一个女清洁工对中国留学生热爱劳动的品质印象很深。当她知道是毛主席教导青年学生要爱劳动并且要同工农兵结合时，感动地说：“毛主席真英明！”新中国的青年学生充满了革命朝气，这也引起了许多法国学生的称道。一个法国女大学生对中国同学说：“你们新中国青年真幸福，生活在毛泽东的时代。你们一谈起自己的祖国，便满怀信心，充满自豪感，表现了对祖国和人民的热爱。”在法国，也同在其他国家一样，革命人民正在勤奋学习毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。在巴黎某大学和法国另外一些地方，一些朋友组织了毛主席著作学习小组。有一个女大学生说：“我们的小组坚持学习《毛泽东选集》。特别对《矛盾论》，更是反复学习，逐字逐句推敲，这篇文章给我们带来巨大的力量。”另一个正在自学中文的大学生说，他学中文是因为伟大的中国革命吸引着他，学好中文便能直接学习毛主席著作，更好地领会毛主席的革命理论。
    有些西方报刊攻击毛主席和毛泽东思想，这时，外国朋友同中国人民站在一起，表示愤慨，并且加以痛斥。一个法国女青年说：“西方报纸不断对中国人民学习和应用毛泽东思想发出嘲笑。他们讥笑中国人在‘卖西瓜’和‘打乒乓’等事情上应用毛泽东思想。其实他们懂得什么？我认为，广大的普通人民能够大学哲学并且加以运用，这是人类历史上从来没有过的了不起的事情，意义是非常深远的。”
