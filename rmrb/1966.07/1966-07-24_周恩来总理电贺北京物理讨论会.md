The countries of the four continents possess boundless potential for the development of science and culture. As long as we unite, break the control and monopoly of imperialism and old and new colonialism over science and culture, persist in the path of self-reliance, and develop friendly cooperation among us, we will surely be able to advance our science and culture to a new era of revival and prosperity.

New China News Agency, July 23rd: The following is the full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's telegram of congratulations to the 1966 Summer Physics Discussion Conference of the Beijing Science Discussion Conference:

Beijing Science Discussion Conference 1966 Summer Physics Discussion Conference:

On behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and in my personal capacity, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the 1966 Summer Physics Discussion Conference of the Beijing Science Discussion Conference being held in our capital, and express a warm welcome to the scientists from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania attending the conference.

This physics discussion conference is held to continue the spirit of the 1964 Beijing Science Discussion Conference, to exchange academic experiences in the field of physics, to explore the path to the revival and prosperity of physics in the four continents, and to promote friendship and unity among scientists from various countries. I believe that with the joint efforts of scientists from the participating countries, this glorious task will surely be accomplished.

The peoples of the four continents have created brilliant ancient civilizations and have excellent scientific and cultural traditions. However, in modern times, the peoples of the four continents have long suffered from the invasions and oppression of imperialism and old and new colonialism, and our scientific and cultural undertakings have been seriously damaged. To establish and develop national and people's scientific and cultural undertakings, the awakened peoples of the four continents must first oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism and strive to maintain national independence. The countries of the four continents possess boundless potential for the development of science and culture. As long as we unite, break the control and monopoly of imperialism and old and new colonialism over science and culture, persist in the path of self-reliance, and develop friendly cooperation among us, we will surely be able to advance our science and culture to a new era of revival and prosperity.

At present, the world is presenting a very good situation. The revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary forces in the world are engaged in a great struggle. A broadest and most genuine international united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs and accomplices, with the revolutionary peoples of the world as its core, is taking shape. The imperialism led by the United States is already surrounded by the people of the world. Victory belongs to the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, Oceania, and the world.

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are carrying out an unprecedented socialist cultural revolution. The victory of this revolution not only opens up a new path for the development of China's scientific and cultural undertakings but also has a profound impact on the Chinese revolution and the world people's revolution. Our Chinese scientists will participate in this conference under the inspiration of the spirit of the socialist cultural revolution and make their own contributions.

I wish the conference a complete success!

Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai

    周恩来总理电贺北京物理讨论会
    我们四大洲的国家，蕴藏着发展科学文化的无限潜力，只要我们团结起来，打破帝国主义和新老殖民主义对科学文化的控制和垄断，坚持走自力更生的道路，发展我们之间的友好合作，就一定可以把我们的科学文化，推进到一个复兴和繁荣的新时期。
    新华社二十三日讯　国务院总理周恩来给北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会的贺电，全文如下：北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会：
    我代表中国人民、中国政府和以我个人的名义，向正在我国首都举行的北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会表示衷心的祝贺，向出席会议的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲的各国科学家表示热烈的欢迎。
    这次物理讨论会，是为了继续贯彻一九六四年北京科学讨论会的精神，在物理学领域内，交流学术经验，探讨复兴和繁荣我们四大洲物理学的道路，促进各国科学家的友谊和团结。我相信，在与会各国科学家的共同努力下，这个光荣的任务，一定能够胜利完成。
    我们四大洲各国人民，创造了辉煌灿烂的古代文明，有着优秀的科学文化传统。但是，近代以来，我们四大洲各国人民长期遭受帝国主义和新老殖民主义的侵略和压迫，我们各国人民的科学文化事业受到了严重的摧残。为了建立和发展民族的、人民大众的科学文化事业，我们四大洲觉醒了的人民，必须首先反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立。我们四大洲的国家，蕴藏着发展科学文化的无限潜力，只要我们团结起来，打破帝国主义和新老殖民主义对科学文化的控制和垄断，坚持走自力更生的道路，发展我们之间的友好合作，就一定可以把我们的科学文化，推进到一个复兴和繁荣的新时期。
    目前，世界上正呈现着一片大好形势。全世界革命势力和反革命势力之间，正在进行着一场大搏斗。一个以世界革命人民为核心的最广泛最真实的反对美帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶的国际统一战线正在形成。以美国为首的帝国主义，已经陷入全世界人民的重重包围之中。胜利属于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、大洋洲和全世界人民。
    我国人民，在毛泽东主席的领导下，正在进行一场史无前例的社会主义文化大革命。这场革命的胜利，不仅为发展我国科学文化事业开创了一条崭新的道路；而且，对中国革命和世界人民革命具有深远的影响。我们中国科学家，将在社会主义文化大革命精神的鼓舞下，参加这次会议，并作出自己的贡献。
    祝会议取得圆满成功！
    中华人民共和国国务院总理　周恩来
                      一九六六年七月二十二日
