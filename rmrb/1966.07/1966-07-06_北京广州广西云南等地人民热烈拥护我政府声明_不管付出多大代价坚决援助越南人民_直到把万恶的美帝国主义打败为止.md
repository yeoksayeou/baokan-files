People in Beijing, Guangzhou, Guangxi, Yunnan, and other places enthusiastically support the government's statement: No matter the cost, we will resolutely aid the Vietnamese people until the evil U.S. imperialists are defeated.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on July 5, the people of the capital strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' heinous and war-mongering acts of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. They express their resolute support for the government's statement on July 3 and sternly warn the U.S. imperialists: Since you have no limits to your aggression, we have no constraints in our counter-aggression. No matter where you expand the war, no matter the cost, the Chinese people will steadfastly support our Vietnamese brothers until we drive the American aggressors out of Vietnam completely and achieve final victory.

Workers at the Beijing Steel Plant are extremely angry about the U.S. imperialists' extremely savage and rampant war actions. Steelworker Li Mingzhi said, "The U.S. imperialists' calculations are to use Vietnam as a base to invade China and the entire Asia. China and Vietnam are brotherly countries that depend on each other. Our government's stern statement represents the seven hundred million people's will to aid Vietnam and resist America. The limits are broken by the American aggressors themselves. The next step in the war is no longer up to the American aggressors. We steel workers and the entire nation have already made full preparations. We are ready at any time to contribute all our strength to support our Vietnamese brothers."

More than 1,800 workers, militiamen, and family members from the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory and the Changxindian Telecommunications Factory held a meeting last night. Militia brigade commander Wang Feng, speaking on behalf of all the militiamen, expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to further prepare to support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

The broad masses of cadres and community members in the Beijing suburbs are extremely angry about the U.S. imperialists' war crimes of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. They express their resolute support for the government's statement issued on July 3. Labor model, Party branch secretary of Huangtugang Brigade, Huangtugang People's Commune, Yin Weichen, said excitedly: "Vietnam is our neighboring country that we depend on each other, the Vietnamese people are our close comrades and brothers, we will not allow the American bandits to run rampant, we are determined to fully support the Vietnamese brothers' just struggle." Li Mulin, deputy director of Sijiqing People's Commune and national agricultural labor model, said: "Our government's statement expresses the wishes of all poor and lower-middle peasants. We firmly support it. We are determined to defeat the U.S. imperialists together with the Vietnamese people. We will support them as long as the war lasts, until we completely defeat the evil U.S. imperialists."

In the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, 3,000 teachers, students, and staff of Peking University held a rally on the afternoon of July 4. When Vietnamese students from this school entered the venue with large banners written in Vietnamese saying "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "U.S. imperialism, get out of Vietnam!" the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly, chanting slogans such as "Salute to the heroic Vietnamese people!" "Vietnam will win, the U.S. will lose!" for a long time. Xia Jianyi, one of the seven comrades who posted the first big-character poster in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at Peking University, a young teacher, said, Chairman Mao has long said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In fact, they are not so powerful. It is people, not things, that determine the course of history." Regarding the U.S. imperialists, this evil war criminal, we must give them a heavy blow. Wherever their aggressive claws reach, we will break them there. The blood debt they owe the Vietnamese people must be repaid in blood. More than 10,000 students, teachers, and staff of Tsinghua University held a demonstration to support Vietnam and denounce the U.S. in the schoolyard on the evening of July 3. The demonstrators sang the "Internationale" and chanted slogans to support Vietnam and resist the U.S., gathering from all directions in front of the dormitory building of the Vietnamese students and handing over a letter of support to the Vietnamese students. Many student representatives in their speeches expressed their resolute support for the government's stern statement and unconditional support for the Vietnamese brothers' just struggle. Central Institute for Nationalities, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Mining and Technology, Beijing Institute of Petroleum, and other schools have also held activities to oppose the U.S. imperialists' mad bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong in recent days.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Guangzhou on July 5, the people of Guangzhou are extremely angry about the U.S. imperialists' mad bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong. Workers, peasants, and students in the entire city have held meetings in recent days, expressing their complete support for the government's statement and their readiness to support the Vietnamese brothers at any time to defeat the American aggressors thoroughly.

Citizens of Guangzhou Paper Mill and Guangzhou Shipyard held meetings today. At the meeting held in Guangzhou Shipyard, militia members Zhang Buqing and Xu Guoqing pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is a desperate attempt to force the Vietnamese people to surrender, but this is wishful thinking. The Vietnamese people are a heroic people who have been tested in battle. The U.S. imperialists will inevitably suffer heavier blows from the 31 million Vietnamese people from this criminal act of "escalating" the war.

The farmers of Sanheli People's Commune in the suburbs of Guangzhou, with a glorious revolutionary tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, are extremely angry about the U.S. imperialists' new acts of aggression and war. The entire armed militia brigade, who had just returned from a field exercise, immediately held a meeting upon hearing the government's statement. Brigade commander Li Guoxin angrily said at the meeting that Johnson's order to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong is a desperate act. This will not save it from its doomed failure.

Teachers, students, and staff of various colleges and universities in Guangzhou expressed their resolute support for the government's statement. They pointed out that the government's statement expresses the voice of 700 million Chinese people. We have been on high alert. As soon as the motherland calls, as soon as the Vietnamese people need us, we will fight side by side with the Vietnamese people. We will not rest until we drive the U.S. out of Vietnam. Students of Zhongshan Medical College said: Since the U.S. imperialists' aggression has no limits, our counter-aggression has no limits either. We solemnly warn the American aggressors: The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will accompany you to the end.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Nanning on July 5, the various ethnic peoples of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which shares mountains and rivers with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, are closely watching the U.S. imperialists' new mad war actions of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. They expressed that the government's statement on July 3 fully expresses the will of the peoples of all ethnic groups in the country. The Chinese people's words are reliable. Since the U.S. imperialists have no limits to their aggression, we have no limits to our counter-aggression. No matter where the U.S. imperialists expand the war, no matter the cost, the Chinese people will steadfastly support our Vietnamese brothers until we drive the American aggressors out of Vietnam completely.

In recent days, from the capital of the autonomous region, Nanning, to the city of Pingxiang under the Friendship Pass, from the coast of Beibu Gulf to the Dongxing County of various ethnic autonomous counties that share fields with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the peoples of various ethnic groups have held meetings to severely condemn the U.S. imperialists' savage and mad acts of aggression and war crimes. On the morning of July 4, some teachers, students, and staff of Guangxi Nationalities Institute held a meeting. Zhuang student Zhang Qiuman, Yao student Lan Chaoding, and Dong student Liang Shanchang, respectively representing all the students in their classes, expressed at the meeting that the Guangxi youth, who have grown up under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, will hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism and are ready to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression.

The masses and militiamen in the border counties of Dongxing, Ningming, Longzhou, Daxin, Jingxi, and other places in Guangxi have held meetings, written letters, and sent telegrams to newspapers in recent days, expressing their determination not to sit idly by and watch the U.S. imperialists' extremely savage and rampant war actions. In the mountainous area of Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, more than 300 core militiamen and poor and lower-middle peasants who were studying in the Mao Zedong Thought study class immediately held a meeting upon hearing the news. At the meeting held by the teachers and students of Donglan County Agricultural School in the revolutionary base area, the speakers pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is a desperate act, which shows that they have been beaten to the point of having no way out. The higher they escalate the war of aggression, the more miserable they will fall. The broad masses of militiamen guarding the border and coastal defense lines in Guangxi are on high alert. Yu Yingting, a militia brigade commander from Pingxiang City's Haikou Commune who once attended the National Militia Representatives Conference, said, the militiamen under the Friendship Pass and the Vietnamese brothers share the same firewood on the same mountain and drink from the same river. Now, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics, and be ready at any time to crush the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression together with the Vietnamese brothers.

The fishermen in Dongxing and Beihai, who have been killed by American bandits in the public sea of Beibu Gulf, are filled with anger about the U.S. imperialists' new acts of aggression and war. Fisherman Zhai Xiumei from Qisha Commune, Dongxing County of various ethnic autonomous counties, said, the hatred of the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples towards the U.S. imperialists is equally deep. On May 28 this year, the U.S. imperialists' military aircraft cruelly killed my wife who was four months pregnant, killed my three-year-old daughter, and injured me and my son. Now, the U.S. imperialists are expanding the war of aggression in Vietnam. Blood debts must be repaid in blood. The crimes of the U.S. imperialists must be thoroughly settled.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Kunming on July 5, the peoples of various ethnic groups in Yunnan Province are extremely angry about the U.S. imperialists' mad bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, which is extremely savage and rampant. They sternly pointed out that the U.S. imperialists have pushed their war of aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious stage. Since the limits have been broken by the Americans, our aid to Vietnam and resistance to the U.S. will have no constraints or restrictions. The peoples of various ethnic groups in Yunnan Province expressed their resolute support for the government's statement and their readiness to take all necessary actions according to the interests and needs of the Vietnamese people to support our Vietnamese brothers.

Workers, peasants, cadres, and students in Kunming have held meetings in recent days. At a meeting, old worker Wang Youqing from Kunming Machine Tool Factory pointed out that since the U.S. imperialists have completely destroyed the Geneva Agreement and further broken the limits between South and North Vietnam, then our counter-aggression has no limits. Zhao Xuequan, who had visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, said, the Chinese people have deep friendship with our Vietnamese brothers. We are determined to aid the Vietnamese people to drive the U.S. imperialists out of Vietnamese territory, no matter the cost.

Li Baoshou, a Yao student, and Deng Yongchang, a Miao student, who are studying at Yunnan Nationalities Institute, said, the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong has pushed the war of aggression to a new and serious stage, which is a serious provocation to our people and the people of the world. We must be prepared for everything and steadfastly support the Vietnamese people until the end.

Many cadres in Kunming have also written letters to the Yunnan branch of Xinhua News Agency in recent days, expressing their resolute support for the Vietnamese people's just struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

    北京钢厂职工对美帝国主义这一极其野蛮极其猖獗的战争行动表示极大愤怒。炼钢工人李明智说，“美帝国主义的如意算盘，是想把越南作为它侵略中国、侵略整个亚洲的基地。中国和越南是唇齿相依的兄弟国家。我国政府的严正声明，代表了我们七亿人民援越抗美的坚强意志。界限是美国侵略者自己打破的，下一步战争怎样打法，已经由不得美国侵略者了。我们钢铁工人和全国人民一道，早已做好充分准备，我们随时准备为支援兄弟的越南人民贡献自己的全部力量。”
    长辛店机车车辆工厂和长辛店通讯工厂一千八百多名职工、民兵和家属，昨晚举行了集会。民兵师师长王峰在会上代表全体民兵，表示决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，进一步作好支援越南人民抗美救国正义斗争的一切准备工作。

    正处在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中的北京大学师生员工，四日下午有三千多人举行了声援集会。当这个学校的越南留学生抬着用越文写的“打倒美帝国主义！”“美帝国主义从越南滚出去！”等巨幅标语进入会场时，全场起立热烈鼓掌，长时间地高呼“向英雄的越南人民致敬”“越南必胜，美帝必败”等口号。在北京大学无产阶级文化大革命中贴出第一张革命大字报的七同志之一、青年教师夏剑豸说，毛主席早就说过：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”对于美帝国主义这个穷凶极恶的战争祸首，必须狠狠地打。它的侵略魔爪伸到那里，我们就把它折断在那里。它所欠下越南人民的血债，必须用血来还。清华大学的一万多名学生、教师和职工三日晚在校园里举行了支援越南、声讨美帝的示威游行。游行的人群高唱《国际歌》，高呼援越抗美的口号，从四面八方汇集到越南留学生宿舍楼前，把一封声援信交给了越南留学生。许多学生代表在讲话中表示，坚决拥护我国政府的严正声明，无保留地支持越南兄弟的正义斗争。中央民族学院、北京师范大学、北京矿业学院、北京石油学院等学校这几天都为反对美帝国主义疯狂轰炸河内、海防举行了声援活动。

    东兴、北海等地曾经在北部湾公海上捕鱼横遭美国飞贼杀害了亲人的渔民，对美帝国主义新的侵略和战争行动，满腔怒火。东兴各族自治县企沙公社渔民翟杏美说，中越两国人民对美帝国主义的仇恨是一样的深。今年五月二十八日，美帝国主义军用飞机在公海上惨无人道地杀害了我怀孕四个月的妻子，杀死了我三岁的女儿，把我和我的儿子打伤，现在美帝国主义又在越南扩大侵略战争，血债要用血来还，美帝国主义的罪行一定要得到彻底的清算。
