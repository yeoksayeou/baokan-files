Great Mao Zedong Thought Nurtures Great Revolutionary Warriors

Parents of Rescued Children Speak About Comrade Liu Yingjun

Cao Sheng (Worker at Jiamusi Textile Mill):
Liu Yingjun comrade sacrificed himself for the safety of our children. This is truly an extraordinary thing. After his sacrifice, over 2,000 people from the Party, government, military, and civilians in Hejiang region held a grand memorial service in our factory. Everyone said, Chairman Mao is truly great, he has educated such a heroic warrior. If he had not acted decisively, many people would have been sacrificed, but he served the people with such determination! Some said, "Leifeng and Wang Jie are far from us, but this time we have seen it with our own eyes, he is Leifeng! He is Wang Jie!" "His sacrifice, as Chairman Mao said, is truly for the people's interests, heavier than Mount Tai."

After Liu Yingjun comrade's sacrifice, I had my elder child read Chairman Mao's works to the whole family. I think, in learning from Liu Yingjun comrade, we must first learn and apply Chairman Mao's works like he did. Chairman Mao's works are the lifeblood of the laboring people, we must truly master them!

Wang Yanmin (Worker at Jiamusi Textile Mill, Advanced Producer):
Liu Yingjun comrade did many good deeds in our residential area before. I had heard about them. That day, when I heard that he sacrificed himself to save my child, I was so moved I didn't know what to say. Liu Yingjun comrade truly had no personal gain, at the critical moment when the horses were about to rush into the crowd, he forcefully brought the horses down, sacrificing himself to save others. He is truly a good warrior of Chairman Mao; he is a good son of the working class and poor peasants. This is all thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao's leadership and guidance. Only great Mao Zedong Thought can nurture such great warriors!

After Liu Yingjun comrade's sacrifice, my husband and I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" five times. We both have the resolve to be like Liu Yingjun comrade, wholeheartedly dedicated to the revolution. Our child also said, "I will learn from Uncle Liu, fearing neither hardship nor death, studying for the revolution, becoming a revolutionary successor." Before, she rarely helped others with chores, but that day, worker Lang Kunwu from our factory said to me, "Your child has changed so much! She is constantly helping us with chores." I asked her at home, and she said, "Uncle Liu, when he was alive, wasn't he always helping everyone in the North District with chores?" Clearly, Liu Yingjun comrade's character has a great influence on the children.

Now, our country is carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, launching an attack on those anti-Party, anti-socialist ghosts and monsters. Liu Yingjun comrade's heroic deeds themselves are a powerful rebuttal to them. My grandmother is already 82 years old, and she said, "Which dynasty has had such an army!"

Dong Guijin (Worker at Jiamusi Textile Mill):
Liu Yingjun comrade sacrificed his life to save six children, including three from my family. I truly cannot express my gratitude. Thinking back to the old society, I suffered so much, I was a child bride, I was beaten by the police with sabers, back then, where was there a way out for the poor? The Party and Chairman Mao came, and only then did I gain liberation and live a happy life. Today, it is a good warrior educated by Chairman Mao who saved my three children, how can I not be deeply grateful to the Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of my heart! With the Party, we have everything, without the Party, we have nothing.

But those anti-Party, anti-socialist black gangs actually dare to slander our Party and Chairman Mao, this is completely counter-revolutionary nonsense. We say, the Party and Chairman Mao's words are all truths; the Party leads us to do things, all for the people. Liu Yingjun comrade was able to sacrifice himself to save others, precisely because he listened to Chairman Mao's words. His heroic deeds are the result of Mao Zedong Thought. The more they oppose our Party and great Mao Zedong Thought, the more we love the Party, the more we love Mao Zedong Thought. The more they oppose us studying Chairman Mao's works, the more we must resolutely study, thoroughly study, not only ourselves but also educate our next generation to study. We must forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the revolution through to the end!

Wang Xuewen (Cook at Jiamusi Textile Mill):
On the morning of March 15th, I had just finished my night shift and returned home when I heard that Liu Yingjun comrade had sacrificed himself to save my child. At that moment, I was truly overwhelmed with emotion. Why could he do this? It is because he truly internalized Chairman Mao's thoughts.

After his sacrifice, we hung his portrait on the wall. I want to use his heroic deeds to educate the children, making them forever listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, learn from Uncle Liu. I myself must also learn from Liu Yingjun comrade, strive to study Chairman Mao's works, earnestly transform my thoughts, and use practical actions to repay our great Party and great leader Chairman Mao.

### 伟大的毛泽东思想　哺育伟大的革命战士　被救儿童家长谈刘英俊同志

    伟大的毛泽东思想  哺育伟大的革命战士
　　被救儿童家长谈刘英俊同志
    曹　生（佳木斯纺织厂工人）：
    刘英俊同志为了我们孩子的安全，情愿自己牺牲，这真是一件了不起的事情。他牺牲后，合江地区党、政、军、民二千多人，在我们厂子里隆重地举行了追悼大会。大家都说，毛主席真伟大，教育出了这样好的英雄战士。他要一撒手，不知牺牲多少人，可人家为人民服务就有这个坚决性！有的说：“雷锋、王杰离咱们远，这回可是亲眼所见，他就是雷锋！他就是王杰！”“他的牺牲，就象毛主席说的那样，真是为人民利益而死，比泰山还重。”
    刘英俊同志牺牲后，我叫大孩子给全家读毛主席著作。我想，咱们向刘英俊同志学习，首先就得象他那样活学活用毛主席著作。毛主席著作是咱劳动人民的命根子，咱们一定要真正把它学到手！
    王艳茗（佳木斯纺织厂工人，先进生产者）：
    刘英俊同志生前，在我们居民区做了许多好事，我早就听别人说过。那天听到他为救我的孩子牺牲了，把我感动得不知说啥好。刘英俊同志真是一点私心也没有，在军马受惊就要闯进人群的节骨眼上，硬是把马弄倒，舍了自己，救了别人。他不愧是毛主席的好战士；是咱工人阶级和贫下中农的好儿子。这都是党和毛主席领导的好，教导的好。只有伟大的毛泽东思想，才能哺育出这样伟大的战士！
    刘英俊同志牺牲以后，我跟孩子他爸爸又学习了五次《为人民服务》，我们俩都有决心象刘英俊同志那样，一心一意地干革命。我们的孩子也说：“我一定向刘叔叔学习，一不怕苦，二不怕死，为革命念书，做革命的接班人。”以前她很少帮助别人干活，可那天我们厂子工人郎坤武跟我说：“你的孩子怎么变化这么大呢？一个劲地帮助我们家干活。”我回家问她，她说：“刘叔叔活着的时候，不是经常在北区帮助大伙干活吗？”可见，刘英俊同志的思想品质对孩子们的影响有多么大。
    现在，我们国家正在进行社会主义文化大革命，向那些反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神开火。刘英俊同志的英雄事迹本身，就是对他们的最有力的回击。我老奶奶今年已是八十二岁的人了，她说：“哪个朝代能有这样的军队！”
    董桂琴（佳木斯纺织厂工人）：
    刘英俊同志豁出自己的生命救出的六个孩子中，有我家三个。我真是无法形容自己感激的心情。回想起在旧社会，我吃尽了苦头，当过童养媳，挨过警察的马刀，那时候哪有穷人的活路。党和毛主席来了，才使我得到了解放，过上了幸福的生活。今天又是毛主席教育出来的好战士救了我的三个孩子，我怎么能不打心眼里感激党和毛主席呢！有了党，才有我们的一切，没有党，我们什么也没有。
    可是那些反党反社会主义的黑帮，竟敢诬蔑我们的党和毛主席，他们这完全是反革命的胡说八道。我们说，党和毛主席说的话，句句是真理；党领导我们办的事，件件为人民。刘英俊同志所以能舍身救人，就是因为他听了毛主席的话。他的英雄行为，是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。这些人越是反对我们的党和伟大的毛泽东思想，我们越是热爱党，越是热爱毛泽东思想。他们越是反对我们学习毛主席著作，我们越要坚决地学，彻底地学，不但自己学，还要教育我们下一代学。一定要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，将革命进行到底！
    王学文（佳木斯纺织厂炊事员）：
    三月十五日那天上午，我上完夜班刚回到家里，听说刘英俊同志为救我的孩子英勇牺牲了。当时，我真是激动万分。他为啥能够这样做呢？他是把毛主席的思想真正装到脑子里去了。
    他牺牲以后，我们把他的象挂在墙上。我要经常用他的英雄事迹来教育孩子，使他们永远听党和毛主席的话，向刘叔叔学习。我自己也要象刘英俊同志那样，努力学习毛主席著作，认真改造思想，用实际行动来报答我们伟大的党和伟大领袖毛主席。（附图片）
