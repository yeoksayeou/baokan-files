According to Xinhua News Agency, Pingjibao State Farm in Ningxia has established a labor university for the urban youth who have gone down to the countryside. This is the first labor university in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

In recent years, large numbers of urban youth from Beijing, Tianjin, and the local area have responded to the Party's call to go to the foothills of the Helan Mountains in Pingjibao to reclaim wasteland and settle down. To cultivate these young people into new-type workers who have both socialist consciousness and certain professional skills, and to enable them to play a greater role in the three great revolutionary movements, Pingjibao State Farm, with the approval of relevant leading departments, decided to establish this labor university.

There are more than 160 students studying at the school, and the teachers are composed of cadres, old farmers, and technicians from the farm.

After half a year of study and labor practice, the students have made rapid progress in their political thoughts and professional skills. The students generally feel that this school, which combines political learning, technical learning, reading, and labor, is indeed a good school for cultivating revolutionary youth.

　　培养下乡知识青年成为新型劳动者
　　宁夏创办第一所农村劳动大学
    据新华社银川电　宁夏平吉堡国营农场为上山下乡的知识青年创办了一所劳动大学。这是宁夏回族自治区的第一所农村劳动大学。
    近几年来，北京、天津和本区的大批城市知识青年响应党的号召，到贺兰山下平吉堡开垦荒滩，安家落户。为了把这批知识青年培养成为既有社会主义觉悟又有一定专业技术的新型劳动者，使他们在三大革命运动中发挥更大的作用，平吉堡国营农场经有关领导部门的批准，决定创办这所劳动大学。
    在校学习的有一百六十多名学生，教师由农场的干部、老农和技术员兼任。
    经过半年的学习和劳动实践，学生的政治思想和专业技术进步很快。学生们普遍反映，既学政治，又学技术，既读书，又劳动，这样的学校真是培养革命青年的好学校。
