	Explosion at U.S. Explosives Factory
	On the 14th, a massive explosion occurred at the Hercules explosives factory in Carthage, Missouri.

	Before the explosion, someone saw a large fireball emerge from the factory, followed by a massive blast that shook the entire city. A huge column of smoke enveloped the entire factory. Subsequently, at least six more explosions occurred. Workers were injured and killed.

	Britain's Economic Situation Deteriorates Further
	On the 14th, the British Labour government was forced to announce new restrictive measures, attempting to solve the economic difficulties through further domestic contraction. The first new restrictive measure was to raise the bank interest rate from 6% to the crisis level of 7%. Another emergency measure was to further tighten credit by increasing the amount of money that banks must deposit with the Bank of England.

	Thailand's Rice Prices Continue to Rise
	Recently, the Thanom–Praphas group in Thailand, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, has been exporting large quantities of rice to support the U.S. invasion forces and the U.S. puppet regimes in Asia, causing Thai rice prices to soar and the people to face starvation.

	Reports indicate that hundreds of thousands of Thai people are now facing the prospect of going hungry.
