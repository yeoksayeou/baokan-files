Title: Resolution on Basutoland

Date: 1966-07-10
Edition: 6

In view of the fact that British imperialists have decided to grant Basutoland a sham independence under the leadership of a pro-fascist puppet regime that practices racial segregation, thereby accelerating its path to becoming a new colonial state, and have ignored the demands of the majority of Basutoland's people for elections before independence, and have openly transferred Basutoland to Vorster's South Africa as a puppet regime or another Bantustan;

The emergency meeting of Asian and African writers held in Beijing from June 27 to July 9, 1966, condemned the British imperialists for signing an unpopular "independence" agreement with the minority government on June 17, 1966, and supported the Basutoland people's demand for elections before independence and their just struggle for genuine independence of their country.

    关于巴苏陀兰的决议
    鉴于英帝国主义者已经决定在一个亲法西斯傀儡、实行种族隔离的少数执政党领导下赐予巴苏陀兰假独立，以便加速它走上新的殖民地国家的步伐，因而对巴苏陀兰大多数人民提出在独立之前举行大选的要求充耳不闻，并且公开地将巴苏陀兰匆匆移交给维沃尔德南非，作为他们的一个傀儡政权，或者成为他们的另一个班图斯坦；
    从一九六六年六月二十七日到七月九日在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议谴责英帝国主义者在一九六六年六月十七日同少数党政府签订了不得人心的“独立”协定；并支持巴苏陀兰人民关于在独立前举行大选的要求和他们争取自己国家真正独立的正义斗争。
