Editor's Note: With the rapid development of the revolutionary cause, our cadre team must continually be supplemented and expanded. Many outstanding comrades have been promoted to new positions, taking on various leadership roles. For these comrades, it is crucial to strive to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, maintain high standards and strict requirements in ideological transformation, and continue to preserve the spirit of being an ordinary soldier. Comrade Sun Leyi has set a good example in this regard.

Comrade Sun Leyi originally served as a quartermaster. After taking on a new role, he persisted in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, maintained high standards for self-revolution, and continuously transformed his thoughts and improved his work, achieving new successes.

Comrade Sun Leyi found "two rulers" and "two mirrors" in Chairman Mao's works. He often said: To transform one's thoughts better and do one's work better, one must frequently measure oneself with the ruler of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and examine oneself with the mirror of being "extremely" responsible to work and "extremely" enthusiastic towards comrades. He did this in the past and continues to do so now. After taking on a new position, he first set a rule for himself: The position may change, but the spirit of being an ordinary soldier must not. He continued to do manual labor such as cleaning toilets, carrying sacks, and delivering goods, always blending in with the masses and serving the unit even better. He took every small flaw in his thoughts seriously, never relaxing in his ideological struggle. Whether to live upstairs or downstairs, whether to sit in the driver's seat or on the vehicle, these seemingly minor issues, he treated as major battles against bourgeois ideology. Because he took a strict and meticulous approach to transforming his thoughts, applying the "two rulers" and "two mirrors" more broadly, he was able to deepen the roots of Mao Zedong Thought, advance on the path of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and inspire more cadres and soldiers to walk the path of ideological revolution.

In January of this year, the organization assigned me to the logistics department of the regiment to serve as the supply section chief. In this new position, I encountered many problems. I brought these problems to the study of Chairman Mao's works, further transforming my thoughts.

The position changed, the work changed, but the spirit of an ordinary soldier must not change.

Arriving at the new position, the objective conditions changed significantly. Could I remember Chairman Mao's teachings and be a good ordinary soldier? This was a new test for me. The supply section had several old comrades, older and more experienced than me, with richer work experience. In front of them, I was a true novice. I should learn from them well. I also warned myself: The party appointed you as the section chief to lead and work harder for the revolution, not to detach yourself from the masses. Although there was an alarm bell in my mind, sometimes problems still arose unconsciously.

After arriving at the section, the comrades were very polite to me, setting up my bed upstairs, next to the deputy director. The comrades said, there's no space downstairs, living upstairs is convenient for discussing work with the leadership. At that time, I didn't think there was any problem, so I moved in. Our section had two assistants living downstairs. After work, I went to their dormitory to play, and they treated me like a guest. Originally, the comrades were chatting and laughing together, but as soon as I arrived, they became "serious." This made me think. In my life, I began to have some distance from the comrades, and in my emotions, I also began to have some distance. If you say there's no space downstairs, we can still squeeze in; if you say there's no bedding, we can move a board. As for saying it's convenient to discuss work with the leadership upstairs, that's just an excuse. It's because I became the section chief that I unconsciously accepted the "special" treatment from the leadership and comrades. Of course, the comrades did this out of class friendship. The problem is that I was content with this treatment. I realized that there was a crack of elitism in my thoughts, and I could not "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people. I decided to move downstairs, to the masses, and live with the assistants. The comrades, seeing me move downstairs, were very enthusiastic, busily setting up my bed. One assistant insisted on giving me his straw mat, refusing to take it back. When sleeping, another assistant covered me with his coat. The comrades' care touched me deeply. From then on, during the day we worked together, during rest we played together, at night we slept together, talking about everything, this incident educated me greatly. I thought, the working conditions changed, but the spirit of an ordinary soldier must not change.

Once, we took a car to the brigade headquarters, and a comrade insisted on pushing me into the driver's seat. I refused to sit, they refused to let me, causing a commotion and delaying the departure. Finally, I had to sit in. Who knew that once I sat in, I had to sit in every time after that, and I even got used to it. Sit, then sit! Later, I thought about it repeatedly and realized that I had a problem. Chairman Mao taught us to be "selfless and dedicated to others," giving convenience to others and leaving difficulties for ourselves. The problem is not about sitting in the driver's seat or not, but about the lack of selflessness and dedication in my thoughts and actions. Therefore, I should not just see it as a problem of sitting in the driver's seat a few times, but should see it as the emergence of a bourgeois ideology of superiority. For example, were there any elderly or sick comrades on the car who needed care? These I did not truly understand. I thought, I sat in the driver's seat a few times, especially the first time, was the beginning of wrong thoughts. If I were still in the company as the quartermaster, no matter how much they pushed, I would not have sat in. I found that my emotions had changed somewhat, which was not in line with Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: "All our working cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people." This means that the higher the position, the greater the responsibility to the people, and one must be a good servant of the people.

Another incident had a great educational impact on me. One evening, it rained slightly, and I returned from the company to the toilet, seeing that the septic tank was almost full. I thought, if the rain gets heavier, the sewage will overflow, so I should quickly remove the sewage. But after looking around, there were no tools, and it was so dark, finding tools elsewhere might not be possible, so I didn't want to remove it. I even comforted myself, thinking that maybe the rain won't be heavy tonight, and it can be removed tomorrow. Thus, I went back to sleep. The next morning, I saw that a night of heavy rain had caused the sewage to overflow, and I felt very bad. Why did my ideological struggle fail this time? It was just laziness in my thoughts, lacking the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly." Thinking further, why couldn't I do what I used to do? This was not just a problem of laziness. After becoming the section chief, I had the thought of not doing "small things" to avoid "big things," which was actually an excuse for doing less for the people. This showed that old ideas still had a foothold in my mind, and as soon as the conditions changed, they came out to cause trouble. Even if you are alert to them, they will not miss any opportunity to cause trouble. Therefore, you must take it seriously, otherwise you might take a wrong step. Later, another evening, I returned from a trip and saw the septic tank was almost full, so I immediately found tools and removed the sewage. Although rainwater and sweat soaked my clothes, I felt very happy. I thought that this was defending the ideological position of an ordinary soldier and taking a new step towards "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people.

"The two rulers" and "the two mirrors," never relax for a moment.

I found the "two rulers" and "the two mirrors" from studying Chairman Mao's works, which played a significant role in transforming my thoughts. I deeply felt that to transform thoughts, one cannot be separated from Chairman Mao's teachings for a moment; to do a good job, one must always insist on the high standard of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. Work must be done every day, and ideological struggle must be waged every day. In the process of completing every task, ideological struggle runs through the entire process. "The two rulers" and "the two mirrors" cannot be separated for a moment.

Not long after I arrived at the supply section, one evening, an assistant handed me a grain and fodder settlement sheet to review and stamp. I looked at it, and there were dense numbers on several forms, and I hesitated. So many numbers, when can they be calculated? I didn't want to check. I thought, this comrade is an old assistant, probably won't make a mistake. But then I thought, no, I have to stamp it, so I have to be responsible, and to be responsible, I have to calculate it carefully. After checking, I found that one pound of grain was calculated wrong, and I immediately took the form to find the assistant. He explained that it was only one pound wrong, no big deal, don't change it, changing it won't look good, anyway, the brigade will verify it, and they will decide the final number. At this time, I should have criticized his idea of seeking appearance over accuracy, but a private thought suddenly flashed in my mind, thinking that this comrade is an old assistant, and I am newly appointed, don't make him lose face, hurt the harmony among comrades, I didn't say anything and left. On the way back, I thought, sending something known to be wrong to the superiors is wrong. No matter what, it must be corrected. Back in the office, I sat down to change it, but as soon as I picked up the pen, my mind started to wander: Just now, I didn't insist on changing it in front of the assistant, and now I'm changing it behind his back, will he have other thoughts? Look, even in this small matter, my thoughts turned so many times, rolled so many times. Finally, I decided to change it. Once, the section held a meeting, and it was already late. I heard that there were two rat holes in the warehouse storing peanuts, and I wanted to block them. But I couldn't move the sacks alone, and if I asked others, they might say, you're really "new officer, three fires," burning during the day and at night. I had reservations, and my actions hesitated. When I thought about the peanuts being in sacks, maybe the rats wouldn't eat them, the thought of "doing it tomorrow" took over. But when I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and not letting the people's interests be harmed, even if it's just one peanut, it shouldn't be wasted, the thought of "no matter what, do it now" took over. Later, I still moved the peanuts that night. The comrades heard that the peanuts were moved to block the rat holes, and they eagerly participated, with great enthusiasm. Their spirit of cherishing state property moved me deeply.

Chairman Mao taught us that every word and action must be in the interests of the people and be responsible to the people. I felt that no matter what you do, as long as it is for the revolution and for the comrades, you don't need to consider anything else. Fear this, fear that, are all individualism, all selfish thoughts. Doing one job, fighting one ideological battle, if the ideological problem is solved, the job is done well; if the ideological problem is not solved, the job is not done well. Every victory in the struggle raises awareness one step, deepens the roots of Mao Zedong Thought one step, the more thorough the struggle, the deeper the roots of Mao Zedong Thought.

I also felt that no matter what work you do, you must have a strong desire and firm attitude to completely and thoroughly transform your thoughts, in order to consciously transform the subjective world while transforming the objective world. When I went down to the company, I always went to the service center to get some stationery and notebooks for the soldiers to choose from; sometimes I also brought them some scraps of cloth to mend clothes and socks. I thought, doing this could solve some of the soldiers' daily needs, saving them the trouble of running around, and could also strengthen the class feelings between me and the soldiers. But once, after returning from a company, passing by a production squad with only three people, I stopped at the crossroads, looking at the sky, it was getting late, and I thought: Go or not? If I go, the soldiers might not be at home, and if they are at home, they might not buy anything. Finally, I thought, I can't go for the things, but for the people, so I took a detour. The production squad had only one soldier at home guarding the door, although he didn't buy anything, he was very grateful for our concern, repeatedly shaking hands with us. I felt that this trip was not in vain, on the one hand, through our actions, we sent a bit of the party's warmth to the soldiers, on the other hand, we also transformed ourselves, making me further realize: Serving the soldiers is the most concrete way to serve the people, to completely and thoroughly serve the people, one must completely and thoroughly transform one's thoughts, and constantly fight against the thoughts of "good enough" and "passable," always insisting on the high standard of self-revolution.

After going to the supply section, I encountered two more incidents that had a great educational significance for me.

One incident was how to view a relatively old assistant. This assistant, in terms of age, was more than ten years older than me; in terms of military service, I only had half of his; in terms of business, he was much more skilled. In these aspects, I was not as good as him. In front of him, I was just a new soldier. So, when interacting with him, I was always cautious and restrained. At that time, I learned that he had some ideological burdens, and I thought, several years of ideological problems have not been solved, what should I do? Later, through heart-to-heart talks and observation, I gradually discovered that he had many good points, such as being very serious in his work and having a desire to learn. He told me several times: "Section chief, you study Chairman Mao's works better than me, we are looking forward to you coming to help us!" At this time, I realized that my attitude towards him was wrong. Chairman Mao taught us: "All members of the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, love each other, and help each other." But I, knowing that this old comrade had ideological burdens, did not actively help solve them, instead, I wrongly thought that he had many problems and was difficult to deal with. This showed that I had not done well in the new comrade relationship of the two "extremes." So, I took the initiative to have a heart-to-heart talk with this assistant, checking my wrong attitude towards him. Later, the section often organized the study of Chairman Mao's works, first using the small rectification method to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," everyone compared themselves to Zhang Side, found the gap, dug out the root of erroneous thoughts, analyzed its harm, and proposed rectification measures. From then on, this assistant also threw away his ideological burdens, and his work enthusiasm soared. One day, a household in the living area caught fire, and he rushed out first. Halfway there, he was out of breath, his face was yellow, but he still insisted on running until the fire was put out. When he learned that the household that caught fire was a poor peasant, he took the initiative to give some money and coupons to help.

Another incident was how to deal with a warehouse keeper. This comrade, after enlisting, had been working in the warehouse for a long time. When I went to the supply section, some comrades told me that this comrade was very poor, not dedicated to work, not enthusiastic about work, the warehouse was in a mess; he also did not obey the leadership, being stubborn and resistant. I thought, such a soldier could not work in the warehouse, so I suggested in the department to transfer him to the company for training. Later, I used the "two rulers" and "two mirrors" to reflect on myself, and I found that this was not in line with Mao Zedong Thought. Heavy responsibilities are placed in front of you, but you do not take them, instead, you pass them to others, how can you be a good comrade? Class brothers have shortcomings, but you do not help solve them, instead, you let him go, how can you be responsible to the comrades! I thought, what should be changed is not the person, but the comrade's thoughts. The formal work time was short, so I used the noon and evening time to go to the warehouse to have a heart-to-heart talk with this comrade, studying Chairman Mao's works together, recalling bitterness and thinking sweetly. When he was sick, we visited him and sent him meals; on May 1st, we specially sent him some gifts to improve his life; for him alone, we specially held a study and application meeting of Chairman Mao's works, inspiring him to study Chairman Mao's works and work hard on the "use" aspect. Soon, this comrade changed, often working during the day and at night, sometimes working despite being sick, taking on all big and small tasks.

These two incidents made me further realize that for any comrade, whether old or new, cadres or soldiers, advanced or backward, one must not have any selfish thoughts, as long as one insists on using the "two rulers" and "two mirrors" to demand of oneself, there will be no problem that cannot be handled. This is actually a matter of believing or not believing in the great power of Chairman Mao's works, a matter of having deep class feelings for the comrades, a matter of having a high sense of political responsibility for the work.

The process of emphasizing politics is the process of transforming one's thoughts.

In recent years, under the party's education, my understanding of emphasizing politics has improved, and I have some experience in handling the relationship between politics and business. The main experience is: The process of emphasizing politics is the process of transforming one's thoughts.

Every year during the spring planting season, the supply section organizes the families to shell peanuts. Every year, shelling peanuts causes worries. According to the comrades, last year when shelling peanuts, to mobilize the enthusiasm of the families, the quota was intentionally set low, proposing "surplus belongs to oneself." But implementing this method, the families' enthusiasm was not only not high, but there were also many objections. This year, when the section discussed this issue, opinions were divided. Some said, just do it the old way, there's no trick! Some said, let's mix all the peanuts together and stabilize the scale, don't let the families catch us. These methods, I always felt were not right, contrary to emphasizing politics. The superiors repeatedly educated us that emphasizing politics must be implemented in the ideological revolution of people, first of all, to see the spiritual achievements. I thought, if we just focus on the peanuts, isn't it seeing things but not people? So, I discussed with everyone to conduct political mobilization among the families, not setting quotas, letting them shell as much as they want, shelling as much as they can! Everyone heard this, some agreed, wanting to try; some said it wouldn't work, worrying about not completing the task. How to do it? I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the commander, the soul, and political work being the lifeline of all work, and Lin Biao's instructions. These teachings strengthened my confidence. Chairman Mao said: "People's social existence determines people's thoughts. And the correct thoughts representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become the material force to transform society and the world." I thought, as long as the families' awareness is raised, there's no need to worry about not completing the task. So, I discussed with everyone the problem seriously, and finally everyone agreed to try.

After the meeting, we followed the plan to first discuss with the family committee, arranging for the families to first study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," solving the problem of how families serve the people. At that time, the country was propagating the advanced deeds of Jiao Yulu, so we combined this study with learning from Jiao Yulu. On the basis of raising awareness, the families accepted the task of shelling peanuts. This time, shelling peanuts was different from before. The families came to get peanuts, and none of them took a lot at once. I was curious and asked them: "You live far away, why not take more to save the trouble of running around?" The families said: "Taking too much at once, can't shell it all, leaving it at home, children eat, rats pull, causing loss to the state, that's not good. Taking less, running more, what's the problem?" Some families, busy with work during the day, shelled at night; some families, with fingers broken from shelling, went to the clinic to bandage and continued to shell; some families, fearing that rats would eat the peanuts, hung the bags on the beam at night. More than ten thousand catties of peanut seeds were quickly shelled. Compared to last year, not only was it shelled faster, but also four hundred and eighty catties of rice were produced. The problem is not about producing a few hundred catties of peanuts. Peanut seeds can be weighed, but spiritual achievements cannot be weighed. The families all said, this year's shelling peanuts was different from before, before it was shelling for the sake of shelling, bourgeois ideology crept in; this year it was shelling for the sake of serving the people, wholeheartedly for the public, the spirit of thrift and serving the people was established. Through this incident, I had a deeper understanding: Emphasizing politics must be firmly believed and unshakable. At the beginning, I knew that emphasizing politics was right, but I couldn't see things without seeing people, my attitude was not very firm. This shows that my understanding of emphasizing politics is still very poor, with blindness.

Through this incident of shelling peanuts, I had a deeper understanding of emphasizing politics, which is to grasp the ideological revolution of people. In completing every specific task, one must grasp the ideological revolution of people. First of all, one must focus on spiritual achievements, and with spiritual achievements, one need not worry about material achievements. Shelling peanuts is a very specific task, but how to treat it has two paths: emphasizing politics and not emphasizing politics. Emphasizing politics, emphasizing the human factor, can release great material force; on the contrary, not emphasizing politics, pursuing material incentives, will poison people's thoughts.

In April, the unit was to issue summer uniforms, which was a relatively complex task. In previous years, summer uniforms were issued by the managers or quartermasters coming to the regiment to pick them up. This year, we learned from the advanced experience of sister units and decided to deliver them directly to the soldiers' hands. To emphasize politics in the issuance of summer uniforms, we specially studied Chairman Mao's statements on political work and Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing politics. Everyone unanimously agreed that emphasizing politics is the lifeline of our business work and all work, politics must command business, and business must serve politics. Therefore, delivering the clothes to the soldiers' hands was not the sole purpose of the work, but more importantly, delivering Mao Zedong Thought, delivering the party's care and warmth. We set up a small mobile exhibition, divided into five parts: the first part was Chairman Mao's instructions; the second part was the glorious traditions of our army; the third part was class education; the fourth part was the good deeds of thrift and saving in our unit; the fifth part was gratitude to the party and the people for their care of us. There were texts, pictures, and real objects, and the comrades' reactions were very good. The comrades said: "We must not forget Chairman Mao's words, we must not forget the pain after the wound heals!" "We wear new clothes, but we must not forget the old society, we must not forget that there are still two-thirds of the people in the world suffering!" A new comrade said: "I originally felt that this year's issuance of clothes was less, but after visiting, it's not less, it's too much! The party cares for us too much, and we serve the people too little!" Many comrades also expressed: "We are the people's army led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we must not detach ourselves from the masses, we must share weal and woe with the people, carry forward and inherit the glorious tradition of thrift and simplicity of our army, and definitely turn the care and warmth given to us by the party and the people into a great driving force for serving the people."

When issuing the clothes, we packaged the items each comrade should receive and placed a quotation from Chairman Mao on thrift and saving on top of each package. We delivered the packages to the soldiers' bedsides, and the first thing they saw when opening the packages was Chairman Mao's instructions. The comrades looked and looked, some said: "I will paste Chairman Mao's instructions on the wall, put them in my heart, and always look at them, not forgetting."

Through this work of issuing clothes, I had a deeper understanding of emphasizing politics. In all business work, politics must be emphasized at all times, but the most important thing is that one must emphasize politics. We originally issued clothes, and some comrades felt that issuing to individuals was too troublesome, not as good as the old way. Some comrades felt that issuing clothes and doing political work was just for show. I also thought, time was indeed tight, and it was easy to make mistakes, and if a mistake was made, it had to be unpacked and checked from the beginning, which was indeed troublesome. However, with the spirit of being extremely responsible to the comrades, one could not fear hardship and fatigue, truly regard the issuance of clothes as a political work, and consciously emphasize politics. In this way, business work could truly achieve the purpose of serving politics, making business work political and ideological, and doing the work well and lively.

### 要“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务  就要“完全”“彻底”地改造思想

    要“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务  就要“完全”“彻底”地改造思想
    孙乐义
    编者按：随着革命事业的飞速发展，我们的干部队伍必然要不断地补充、生长。大批优秀的同志，被提拔到新的岗位上来，担负各级领导职务。对于这些同志来说，努力用毛泽东思想武装自己，在思想改造上坚持高标准、严要求，继续保持普通一兵的本色，是个十分重要的问题。孙乐义同志在这方面树立了一个很好的榜样。
    孙乐义同志原来担任司务长的工作。他在担负了新的工作职务以后，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，坚持自我革命的高标准，用毛泽东思想不断改造思想、改进工作，不断取得新的成就。
    孙乐义同志从毛主席著作里，找到了“两把尺子”、“两面镜子”。他常常讲：要把思想改造得好一些，把工作做得好一些，就要经常用“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务的尺子量一量，用对工作“极端”负责，对同志“极端”热忱的镜子照一照。他过去是这样做的，现在还是这样做。担任了新的职务以后，他首先给自己订了一条守则：职务变了，普通一兵的本色不能变。他仍然和过去一样掏大粪、扛麻袋、送货上门，处处和群众打成一片，为连队服务得更加出色。他严肃、认真地对待自己思想上的每一个细小的疵点，一时一刻也不放松思想斗争。住楼上还是住楼下？坐在驾驶室里还是坐在车上？这些不大容易引起人们注意的“小事”，他都看做是同资产阶级思想争夺阵地的大事。正因为他对待自己的思想改造“从难从严”，一丝不苟，把“两把尺子”、“两面镜子”在更大的范围内广泛应用，才能把毛泽东思想的根子越扎越深，才能在“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务的大道上不断前进，才能带动更多的干部和战士，走上思想革命化的道路。
    今年一月，组织上调我到团后勤处担任军需股长。在新的工作岗位上，遇到不少问题。我带着这些问题，活学活用毛主席著作，进一步改造思想。
    职务变了，工作变了，普通一兵的思想不能变
    到了新的工作岗位，客观条件起了很大变化。能不能牢记毛主席的教导，当好普通一兵，是对我的一个新的考验。军需股里有好几个老同志，年龄比我大，资历比我长，工作经验比我丰富，在他们面前，我是个地地道道的新兵。我应该好好地向他们学习。我还特别警告自己：党叫你当股长，是让你领头多干活，为革命多出力，你可不能脱离群众。尽管脑子里有这么个警钟敲打着，可是有时还是自觉不自觉地发生了问题。
    我到股里工作以后，同志们对我很客气，把我的床铺搭在楼上，和副处长住在一起。同志们说，楼下没地方了，住在楼上和领导靠得近，研究工作方便。当时我没觉得有什么问题，就住下来了。我们股有两个助理员住在楼下，下班后我到他们的宿舍去玩，他们待我象客人一样。本来同志们在一起有说有笑，可是我一去，就“严肃”起来了。这引起我的考虑。我生活上开始和同志们有了一点距离，感情上也开始有一点距离了。要说楼下没地方，挤一挤还是可以的；要说没铺板，搬一块就行。至于说在楼上和副处长研究工作方便，那不过是借口。就因为自己是股长了，不自觉地接受了领导和同志们的“特殊”照顾。当然，同志们是出自阶级友爱的感情。问题是自己对这种照顾心安理得。我意识到，思想上有了特殊化的裂缝，就不能“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务。我决心搬下楼去，到群众中去，和助理员们住在一起。同志们见我下了楼，热情得很，忙着给我搭铺。一位助理员硬把自己的草褥子让给我，不要还不行。睡觉时，另一位助理员还把他的大衣盖到我身上。同志们的关怀使我十分感动。从此，白天大家工作在一起，休息时大家玩在一起，晚上还睡在一起，无话不谈，这件事对我教育很大。我想，工作条件变了，但普通一兵的本色决不能变。
    有一次，我们坐汽车到师部去，一块去的同志强推硬拉非要我坐到驾驶室里不可，我怎么也不坐，他们怎么也不让，闹得开不了车，没办法，我就只得坐进去。谁知这样开了头，以后就不能不坐了，自己也有点习惯了。坐就坐吧！后来，我反复地想，才察觉自己是有问题的。毛主席教导我们，对待任何事情，都要“毫不利己专门利人”，把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己。问题不在坐不坐驾驶室，而在于思想行动上缺少了毫不利己专门利人的精神。因此，不能只看成坐了几次驾驶室的问题，而应该看到：这是在自己的思想上出现了资产阶级高人一等的思想苗头。比如，同车的同志有没有年龄大的，身体不好的，需要照顾？这些我都不真正了解。我想，我几次都坐进驾驶室，特别是第一次坐进去，是错误思想的开端。要是我还在连里当司务长，大家怎么拉我也决不会坐的。我发现自己在感情上已经有些变化了，这是不符合毛主席的教导的。毛主席说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”。这就是说，职务越高，对人民的责任越大，更要当好人民的勤务员。
    还有件事对我教育很大。有一天晚上下小雨，我从连队回来，到厕所去，看到粪便池子快满了。心里就想，雨再下大了，粪便就会漫出来，应该赶快把粪便挑出来。可是，四处找了找没有工具，天又那么黑，到别的地方去找，也不一定有，就不想挑了。自己还自我安慰地想，也许今晚雨下不大，明天再挑也不迟。就这样回去睡了觉。第二天早晨起来一看，一夜的大雨，把厕所里的粪都冲跑了，我心里觉得很难受，为什么这次思想斗争会失败了呢？无非是思想深处有了个“懒”字，缺乏“完全”“彻底”的精神。再仔细想想，为什么过去可以做到的事，现在就不做了呢？这就不仅是个“懒”的问题。当股长以后，还有过这种想法，不要因为做一些“小事”误了大事，这实际上是为自己少做为人民有利的事找了借口。这说明旧意识在我脑子里还有地盘，条件一变化，就出来捣乱。即使你对它有所警惕，它也决不放过捣乱的机会。因此，一定要认真对待，否则就可能一步不慎，走错了路。后来，又一个晚上，我出发回来，又看到粪池快满了，就毫不犹豫地找来工具把大粪挑走了。虽然雨水汗水湿透了衣服，心里觉得十分愉快。我认为，这样做，是守卫了普通一兵的思想阵地，是向“完全”“彻底”为人民服务迈出了新的一步。
    “两把尺子”，“两面镜子”，时时刻刻不能放松
    我从学习毛主席著作中，找到的“两把尺子”和
  “两面镜子”，对我的思想改造，起了不小的作用。我深刻地体会到：要改造思想，一刻也离不开毛主席的教导；要做好工作，时刻都要坚持“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务的高标准。工作要天天做，思想斗争天天有，在完成每一件工作的过程中，自始至终贯穿着思想斗争。“两把尺子”、“两面镜子”一时一刻也不能离开。
    我刚到军需股不久，有一天晚上，一位助理员送给我一份粮秣决算表，要我审查盖章。我一看，几张表格上，全是密密麻麻的数字，就犹豫起来。这么多数字，什么时候能算完？就不想核对。我想，这个同志是个老助理员了，大概不会有错。又一想，不行。要我盖章，我就要负责，要负责就要好好算算。经过核对以后，我发现算错了一斤粮，当时就拿着表格去找这位助理员。他解释说，只错了一斤，问题不大，不要改了，改了不好看，反正师里还要核实，以他们最后核定的数字为准吧。这时候，我本来应该批评他光图好看、不求准确的想法不对，但是思想上忽然闪出了一个私念，觉得这个同志是个老助理员，自己刚刚到职，别弄得人家下不了台，伤了同志间的和气，我没再说什么就走了。在回来的路上，我想，把明知错了的东西送给上级，这是不对的。无论如何要改正过来。回到办公室，坐下来就要改，刚拿起笔，脑子里又活动起来：刚才当着那位助理员的面没有坚持改，现在又背地里改了，会不会引起他有什么别的想法？你看，就是这么件小事，思想上前后转了多少转，打了多少滚。最后，才下决心改了。一次，股里开过会，已经很晚了，我听说放花生米的仓库里有两个老鼠洞，想去堵一堵。可是，我一个人搬不动麻袋，找别人呢，又怕同志们说，你真是“新官上任三把火”，白天烧，晚上也烧。心里有了顾虑，行动上就犹豫了。当想到花生米都是麻袋装的，也许老鼠吃不了的时候，“明天再搬”的思想就占了上风。但是，想到毛主席教导的“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务，想到不能让人民的利益受到损失，哪怕是一粒花生米也不能白白糟蹋掉，“说什么也要马上搬”的思想就占了上风。后来，还是当夜搬了。同志们听说搬花生米堵老鼠洞，争先恐后，干劲很大。他们那种爱护国家资财的精神，使我很受感动。
    毛主席教导说，我们的每一句话，每个行动，都要符合人民的利益，都要向人民负责。我体会到，不管干什么事情，只要是为革命负责，为同志负责，别的什么也不要去考虑。怕这怕那的，都是个人主义，都是私心杂念。干一件工作，斗一次思想，思想问题解决了，工作完成得就好；思想问题解决不好，工作完成得就不好。每斗胜一次，觉悟就提高一步，毛泽东思想的根子就扎深一分，斗争越彻底，毛泽东思想的根子就扎得越深。
    我还体会到：无论干什么工作，都要有一个完全彻底改造思想的强烈愿望和坚定态度，才能在改造客观世界的同时，自觉地改造主观世界。我下连时，总要到服务社弄点信纸、学习本让战士选购；有时还给他们带些补衣服补袜子的碎布。我想，这样做，一方面可以解决战士们的一些日常需要，节省他们跑路的时间，一方面也能增强自己和战士的阶级感情。可是有一次，从一个连队回来，路过一个只有三个人的生产小分队时，在路口上停了下来，看看天不早了，心里盘算：去还是不去？去了战士不一定在家，在家也不一定买东西。最后想到，不能为物要为人，还是绕着道去了。小分队只有一个战士在家看门，他虽然没有买东西，但是对我们的关心非常感激，一再和我们握手。我感到这一趟没有白跑，一方面通过我们的行动把党的一分温暖送到了战士身上，另一方面，也改造了我自己，使我进一步认识到：为战士服务，就是最具体地为人民服务，要完全彻底地为人民服务，就要完全彻底地改造思想，要经常地和“差不多”
  “过得去”的思想斗，时时刻刻坚持自我革命的高标准。
    到军需股后，还遇到两件事，对我很有教育意义。
    一件事是怎样看待一个比较老的助理员的问题。这个助理员，论年纪，比我大十多岁；论军龄，我只有他的一半；论业务，比我熟练得多。这些我都比不上。在他面前，我只是一个新兵。所以，和他接触时总是顾前顾后，束手束脚。当时我了解到他有一些思想包袱，心想，好几年的思想问题还没解决，这可怎么办呢？后来，经过谈心、观察，我逐渐发现他有很多优点，比如工作很认真，而且有要求学习的愿望。他几次对我说：“股长，你学毛主席著作比我好，我们盼着你来好好帮助帮助我们！”这时，我才发现自己对他的态度是不对的。毛主席教导我们：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”可是我对这样一个老同志，明知他有思想包袱，而不去积极地帮助解决，相反地，还错误地认为他问题很多，不好办。这说明自己在新的同志关系上没有做到两个“极端”。于是，我就主动找这位助理员谈心，检讨我对他的错误态度。后来，股里经常组织学习毛主席著作，首先用小整风的方法学了《为人民服务》，大家对照张思德，找了差距，挖了错误思想的根源，分析了它的危害，提出了改正措施。从此，这位助理员也扔掉了思想包袱，工作情绪更高涨了。有一天，住地一户老百姓失了火，他争先跑出去，半路上气喘不上，脸色干黄，仍坚持着跑，一直到救完火才回来。当他知道失火的是一户贫农时，还主动拿出一些钱和布票去救济。
    再一件事是对待一位仓库保管员的问题。这个同志入伍后长期在仓库做保管工作。我到军需股，有的同志就对我说，这个同志很差劲，不安心工作，工作不积极，仓库搞得乱七八糟；又不服从领导，顶顶抗抗。我想，这样一个战士在仓库工作怎么能行？便在处里提意见，把他调到连队锻炼锻炼。后来，我用“两把尺子”“两面镜子”对照一下，我发现这是不符合毛主席思想的。重担子放在面前，自己不挑，反而推给别人，这怎么能算是好同志？阶级兄弟有了缺点，不去帮助解决，反而让他一走了事，怎么能对得起同志！我想，更换的不应该是人，而是这个同志的思想。正式工作时间少，我就利用中午晚上时间到仓库去，找这个同志谈心，和他一起学习毛主席著作，忆苦思甜。他有病了，我们去看望他，送病号饭；过“五一”节，我们专门给他送去了些礼物，改善生活；为他一个人，我们专门开了一个学习毛主席著作讲用会，启发他学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。不久，这个同志就变了样子，常常白天干了晚上干，有时带病坚持工作，大事小事都揽着干。
    这两件事，使我进一步认识到，对任何同志，不管是老同志、新同志，干部、战士，先进的、后进的，都不能有任何私心杂念，只要坚持用“两把尺子”“两面镜子”去要求自己，就没有难以处理的问题。这实际上是相信不相信毛主席著作的巨大威力的问题，是对同志有没有深厚的阶级感情的问题，是对工作有没有高度政治责任心的问题。
    突出政治的过程就是改造自己思想的过程
    近年来，在党的教育下，我对突出政治的认识有了一些提高，在处理政治与业务的关系上，有了一些体会。主要的体会是：突出政治的过程，就是改造自己思想的过程。
    每年到了春播季节，军需股要组织家属们剥花生种。年年剥，年年犯愁。据同志们说，去年剥花生，为了调动家属们的积极性，定指标的时候有意地定低了点，提出什么“超产归己”。但实行这个办法，家属们的积极性不但不高，还有不少意见。今年股里研究这个问题的时候，众说不一。有的说，还是照老办法干，没什么窍门！有的说，咱把花生都堆到一起拌匀，把秤掌稳，不让家属抓住把柄就行。这些办法，我总觉得不对头，和突出政治相违背。上级反复教育我们，突出政治，要落实到人的思想革命化上，首先要看精神成果。我想，要是光在花生上打圈子，岂不是见物不见人？于是，我便和大家商量，在家属中进行政治动员，不定指标，放手让他们剥，剥多少算多少！大家听了，有的赞成，想试试；有的说不行，担心收不够数。究竟怎么办？我重新反复学习了毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切工作的生命线的教导和林彪副主席的指示。这些教导，坚定了我的信心。毛主席说：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”我想，只要把家属的觉悟提高了，就不怕完不成任务。于是，我就和大家一起认真研究了这个问题，最后大家同意试试看。
    会后，我们按照计划先和家属委员会研究，安排家属首先学习《为人民服务》，解决家属如何为人民服务的问题。当时，全国正在宣传焦裕禄的先进事迹，我们就把这次学习和学焦裕禄结合起来。在提高觉悟的基础上，家属接受了剥花生的任务。这次剥花生一开始，就和往年不一样。家属来领花生，没有一个一次领很多的。我就奇怪，问她们：“你们住得老远，为什么不多装点？省得来回跑腿。”家属们说：“一次多拿了剥不完，放到家里，孩子吃，老鼠拉，给国家造成损失那还行。少拿点，勤跑点，怕什么？”有的家属，白天事多没空剥，就晚上干；有些家属手指头剥破了，到卫生所包块胶布继续干；有的家属怕老鼠吃了花生米，晚上把袋子吊到梁上。一万多斤花生果很快就剥完了。同去年比，不仅剥得快，还多出了四百八十斤米子。问题不在多出了几百斤花生米。花生米可以用秤称出来，但精神上的成果，却是没法称的。家属们都说，今年剥花生和往年不一样，往年是为剥而剥，剥了花生，资产阶级思想钻进来了；今年是为人民服务而剥，一心为公，勤俭节约的为人民服务的思想树立起来了。通过这件事，使我更深刻地认识到：对突出政治一定要坚信不疑，坚定不移。开始我明知道突出政治是对的，不能见物不见人，但态度并不十分坚定。这说明自己对突出政治的认识还是很差的，带有盲目性。
    通过剥花生这件事，我更深刻地懂得了突出政治，就是要抓人的思想革命化。在完成每一项具体任务中，都要抓人的思想革命化。首先要着眼于精神成果，有了精神成果，就不愁没有物质成果。剥花生是一件很具体的事，但怎么对待它，却有突出政治和不突出政治的两条道路。突出政治，强调人的因素，就能发挥巨大的物质力量；反之，不突出政治，搞物质刺激，就会毒害人的思想。
    四月份部队要发单衣了，这是个比较复杂的工作。往年夏服发放，都是管理员或司务长到团里来领，今年我们学习了兄弟单位的先进经验，决定亲自送到战士手里。为了在夏服发放中突出政治，我们专门学习了毛主席关于政治工作的论述和林副主席关于突出政治的指示。大家一致认识到，突出政治是我们的业务工作和一切工作的生命线，政治必须统帅业务，业务必须为政治服务。因此，我们把衣服送到战士手里，并不是全部工作目的，更重要的是送去毛泽东思想，送去党的关怀和温暖。我们就办了一个小型的流动展览，共分五个部分：第一部分是毛主席的指示；第二部分是我军的光荣传统；第三部分是阶级教育；第四部分是我们单位勤俭节约的好人好事；第五部分是感谢党和人民对我们的关怀。有文字，有图片，也有实物，同志们看了反映很好。同志们说：“毛主席的话咱们可不能忘记，可不能好了疮疤忘了痛啊！”
  “我们穿上新衣服，可不能忘了旧社会，可不能忘了世界上还有三分之二受苦受难的人民！”有个新同志说：“我原来觉得今年发衣服少，这么一参观，不是少，是太多了！党对自己太关怀，自己为人民服务太不够了！”许多同志都表示：“我们是共产党和毛主席领导的人民军队，决不能脱离人民群众，我们要和人民同甘共苦，要发扬和继承我军勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的光荣传统，一定把党和人民给我们的关怀和温暖，变成我们为人民服务的巨大推动力。”
    发衣服的时候，我们把同志们该领的东西包到一起，每一包上面放上一张毛主席有关勤俭节约的语录。我们把衣包送到战士的床头，打开衣包首先看到了毛主席的指示。同志们看了又看，有的说：“我要把毛主席的指示贴在墙上，装在心里，时刻看着它，不能忘了。”
    通过发衣服这件工作，使我对突出政治有了更深的体会。在一切业务工作中，都应该突出政治，任何时候都应该突出政治，但最重要的是自己一定要突出政治。我们原来发衣服时，有的同志就感到发到个人太麻烦，不如照老办法好。有的同志感到发衣服搞政治工作，也是搞一点做做样子。我也曾想，时间确实紧，也很容易发错，一发错就要从头解包清查，确实有点麻烦。但是，有了为同志极端负责的精神，就能不怕苦不怕累，真正把发衣服当成一项政治工作，就能自觉地突出政治。这样，业务工作才能真正达到为政治服务的目的，才能把业务工作做得有政治性，有思想性，把工作做好做活。
