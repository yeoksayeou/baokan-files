The General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army's Liaison Delegation strongly protests against the U.S. air raids on residential areas in Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 20th — Major General Hoang Van Thu, head of the Vietnam People's Army's General Staff Liaison Delegation, sent an urgent telegram to the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam on the 20th, strongly protesting the barbaric bombing by U.S. aggressor planes on the 19th of many residential areas in Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The telegram pointed out that the above-mentioned extremely serious war actions by U.S. imperialism are part of the plot by the U.S. aggressors to strengthen and expand the use of their air force to wage a destructive war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It exposes the extremely brutal and warlike face of U.S. imperialism, shattering the false peace rhetoric of the Johnson administration. This is also an extremely arrogant provocation to the progressive people of the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 20th — The head of the Vietnam People's Army's General Staff Liaison Delegation sent an urgent telegram to the chairman of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam on the 19th, strongly protesting the large-scale military "sweeping" operations by U.S. aggressors and their puppet troops in the southern region near the demilitarized zone in Quang Tri Province.

The telegram pointed out that since July 15th, U.S. imperialism has deployed 8,000 U.S. Marines and 3,000 puppet troops, under the cover of a large number of aircraft and warships from the U.S. Seventh Fleet, to launch a large-scale "sweeping" operation in the northern region of Cam Luong County, Quang Tri Province, near the southern part of the demilitarized zone. In the "sweeping" operation, after the U.S. aggressor forces indiscriminately bombed the area with B-52 bombers, they stormed into villages, indiscriminately shooting and killing innocent people, and burning down a large number of houses.

The telegram said that this is an extremely serious action that violates the nature of the demilitarized zone. This action, along with the recent U.S. bombings of the northern region of the demilitarized zone, has created an extremely tense situation in the temporary military demarcation line area.

The telegram firmly demands that the U.S. and the Saigon puppet regime immediately stop the above-mentioned "sweeping" operations, that the U.S. stop its war of aggression against South Vietnam, and that all U.S. troops and their accomplice forces be withdrawn from South Vietnam.

    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团
    抗议美机轰炸河内等城市居民区的罪行
    新华社河内二十日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校，二十日打紧急电报给越南国际委员会，强烈抗议美国强盗飞机十九日野蛮轰炸越南民主共和国的河内、海防和越池等城市的许多居民集中区的罪行。
    电报指出，美帝国主义的上述极其严重的战争行动，是美国侵略者正在加强和扩大使用空军对越南民主共和国进行破坏性战争的阴谋的一部分。它揭穿了美帝国主义的极其残暴的好战面目，粉碎了约翰逊政府假和平的论调。这也是对世界进步人民的一个极端蛮横的挑衅。
    新华社河内二十日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长十九日打紧急电报给越南国际委员会主席，强烈抗议美国侵略者及其走狗军队在靠近非军事区南部地区的广治省进行大规模军事“扫荡”。
    电报指出，从七月十五日以来，美帝国主义出动美国海军陆战队八千人，伪军三千人在美国第七舰队的大批飞机和军舰的掩护下，对靠近非军事区南部地区的广治省甘露县北部地区发动了一次大规模的“扫荡”。在“扫荡”中，美国侵略军在用B—52型飞机滥肆轰炸以后，就冲进村庄，大肆开枪杀害无辜人民，并且烧毁大批房屋。
    电报说，这是具有破坏非军事区性质的极端严重的行动。这一行动与最近期间美国接连轰炸非军事区北部地区的行动，给临时军事分界线地区造成了极其紧张的局势。
    电报坚决要求美国和西贡伪政权立即停止上述“扫荡”，美国停止侵略越南南方的战争，把美军及其帮凶军全部撤出越南南方。
