The Liberation Army of South Vietnam has launched a fierce assault in Quang Tri Province in recent days, engaging in continuous battles with U.S. invaders and inflicting heavy casualties.

According to reports from Western news agencies, 8,000 U.S. Marines and 3,000 South Vietnamese puppet troops recently conducted a large-scale "sweep" in the northern part of Quang Tri Province. The Liberation Army of South Vietnam, together with local residents, bravely confronted the enemy. On the 15th, they surrounded a battalion of U.S. Marines and launched a fierce artillery attack. On the 16th, when another battalion of U.S. Marines came to reinforce, they were also attacked. In these two days, more than ten U.S. helicopters were shot down by the ground artillery of the Liberation Army. The battle intensified on the 18th. The Liberation Army launched a fierce assault on two rear guard units of the U.S. Marine Corps' 4th Regiment, killing the enemy in a four-hour battle that left corpses strewn across the battlefield. That afternoon, a battalion of U.S. Marines moving from one position to another was also attacked by the Liberation Army. In the early hours of the 21st, the Liberation Army used mortars to bombard a command post of a U.S. Marine battalion, causing casualties among the U.S. troops.

According to another report, the Liberation Army also shelled the U.S. military airfield in Quang Ngai in the early hours of the 21st. On the 19th, a reconnaissance platoon of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division was ambushed by the Liberation Army shortly after disembarking from helicopters near Saigon, suffering heavy casualties.
