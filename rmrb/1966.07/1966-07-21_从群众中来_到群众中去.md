Comrade Mao Zedong has said: "In all our party's practical work, correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses." The work of the proletarian cultural revolution is no exception.

In the course of the cultural revolution movement, units where the work is done well are those where the responsible comrades, in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, stand at the forefront of the movement, mobilize the masses, and boldly encourage the masses to put up big-character posters, to engage in great debates, and to lead the masses into the battle to sweep away all monsters and demons.

These good responsible comrades are able to first be students of the masses and then teachers of the masses. They are able to listen more, to look more, to think more, and to listen to the opinions of the masses.

They dare to criticize themselves for the shortcomings and mistakes in their work. They welcome the big-character posters put up by the masses to expose and criticize them, and they have a high degree of communist style.

In this way, they gain the trust of the masses, gain the initiative, the right to speak, and the right to lead in their work, and are able to lead the movement well.

However, there are also some units where the responsible comrades are not like this. They are like the man who loved dragons but was afraid of real ones, talking about the mass line but afraid when the masses rise up. They are afraid of this and that, afraid that the revolutionary fervor of the masses will burn them, afraid that the masses will catch them by their little tails. In fact, comrades who have made ordinary mistakes, if they dare to face up to their shortcomings and mistakes, sincerely and seriously engage in self-criticism, humbly accept the criticisms of the masses, and have the determination and actions to correct their mistakes, the masses will understand them and welcome them.

There are also a few who adopt an official's attitude towards the masses, placing themselves above the masses. They do not listen to the opinions of the masses at all. If the masses put up a few big-character posters about them, they cannot stand it. They even find various excuses to suppress the mass movement and retaliate against the masses. They cannot lead the cultural revolution in this way, and they will not be able to get by, and in the end, they will be abandoned by the masses.

Comrade Mao Zedong has said: "All our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people to serve."

Communist Party members must not adopt a bourgeois attitude towards the masses. The proletarian cultural revolution is precisely to carry out a revolution against those bourgeois lords. If Communist Party members do not humbly learn from the masses and adopt an official attitude towards the masses, where is the spirit of a Communist Party member? This is not the style of the Communist Party, but the style of the Kuomintang.

Comrade Mao Zedong said in Yan'an that we must distinguish between the style of the Communist Party and the style of the Kuomintang. The style of our Communist Party is to be close to the masses, to learn from the masses, to serve the people wholeheartedly, and to engage in self-criticism for our shortcomings and mistakes, just as we wash our faces and sweep the floor every day. The style of the Kuomintang is to be detached from the masses, to ride on the heads of the masses, and to oppress the masses.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: Communist Party members must not retain the style of the Kuomintang, must not retain the dust of bureaucratism and militarism.

Most Communist Party members can distinguish between the style of the Communist Party and the style of the Kuomintang. However, some people can distinguish at times and cannot at other times; or they can distinguish in some matters but cannot in others. For a Communist Party member, it is most dangerous if they cannot distinguish between the style of the Communist Party and the style of the Kuomintang, for then they have stood on the wrong side, on the side opposite to the revolutionary mass movement.

Every revolutionary road is not straight and smooth; it is bound to be tortuous and have ups and downs. The proletarian cultural revolution, such a great revolution that touches people's souls, such an extremely sharp, extremely complex, and extremely profound class struggle, is bound to produce some shortcomings and mistakes and encounter some twists and turns in the course of the movement. The question is how to strive to do the work of leading the movement better, to make the movement develop more healthily, to strive for fewer mistakes and fewer twists and turns.

Can we do better? We can. That is to implement Comrade Mao Zedong's mass line of the party and adhere to the policy of mobilizing the masses.

The rapid development of the proletarian cultural revolution has caught many people off guard. Every Communist Party member should undergo testing in this great revolution and in the fiery struggle of the masses. They should prove with their actions that they are faithful servants of the people and that they truly regard Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings as the highest directive for all their actions.

### 从群众中来　到群众中去

    从群众中来　到群众中去
    毛泽东同志说：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。”无产阶级文化革命的工作，也是同样的。
    在文化革命运动中，凡是工作做得好的单位，就是因为那里的负责人，他们能够按照毛泽东同志的教导，站在运动的最前面，放手发动群众，大胆地鼓励群众贴大字报，进行大鸣大放，大辩论，领导群众投入到横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的战斗中去。
    这些好的负责人，能够先做群众的学生，再做群众的先生。
    他们能够多听，多看，多想，多倾听群众的意见。
    他们对自己工作中的缺点和错误，敢于引火烧身。
    他们对群众贴大字报揭露和批判自己，采取欢迎态度，具有高度的共产主义风格。
    这样，他们就获得了群众的信任，获得了在工作上的主动权、发言权和领导权，就能够把运动领导好。
    但是，也有些单位的负责人，并不是这样。他们象叶公好龙一样，口头上也讲群众路线，等到群众起来了，他们却害怕了。他们怕这怕那，怕群众的革命烈火烧到自己身上来，怕群众抓住自己的一些小辫子。其实，这些犯了一般错误的同志，只要敢于正视自己的缺点和错误，诚恳地认真地进行自我批评，虚心地接受群众的批评，并且在行动上有改正错误的决心和表现，群众是会谅解他们的，也是会欢迎他们的。
    另有少数人，对群众摆出做官当老爷的架式，把自己摆在群众之上。群众的意见，他们根本听不进。群众贴了他们几张大字报，他们就受不了。他们甚至找种种借口压制群众运动，对群众进行打击报复。他们这样做，就不可能领导文化革命，日子就混不下去，结果就会被群众所抛弃。
    毛泽东同志说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”。
    共产党员绝不能够用资产阶级老爷式的态度对待群众。无产阶级文化大革命，就是要对那些资产阶级老爷们进行革命。共产党员如果不虚心向群众学习，对群众摆出一副官架子，这哪里有什么共产党员的气味呢？这根本不是共产党的作风，而是国民党的作风。
    毛泽东同志在延安时就说过，要分清什么是共产党的作风，什么是国民党的作风。我们共产党的作风，就是密切联系群众，向群众学习，全心全意为人民服务，对自己的缺点和错误，要象天天洗脸、天天扫地一样，经常进行自我批评。国民党的作风，就是脱离群众，骑在群众头上，欺压群众。
    毛泽东同志说：共产党员绝不能保存国民党的作风，绝不能保存官僚主义灰尘和军阀主义灰尘。
    对于什么是共产党的作风，什么是国民党的作风，大多数共产党员是分得清的。但是，有些人有时候分得清，有时候又分不清；或者在一些问题上分得清，在另外一些问题上又分不清。对于共产党员来说，竟然分不清共产党作风和国民党作风的界限，那是最危险的，那就站错了队，站到革命群众运动的对立面的位置上去了。
    任何革命的道路都不是笔直的，平坦的，总是有曲折的，有高高低低的。无产阶级文化大革命，这样一场触及人们灵魂的大革命，这样一场极其尖锐、极其复杂、极其深刻的阶级斗争，在运动中产生一些缺点和错误，出现一些曲折，这是难免的现象。问题是要力求把领导运动的工作做得更好些，使运动发展得更健康些，力争少一些错误，少一些曲折。
    能不能够做得更好些呢？完全能够。那就是要贯彻执行毛泽东同志提出的党的群众路线，坚持放手发动群众的方针。
    无产阶级文化大革命发展之迅猛，对不少人说来，是缺乏思想准备的。每个共产党员都应该在这场大革命中，在群众斗争的烈火中经受考验。他们应当用自己的行动，证明自己是人民群众的忠实的勤务员，证明自己是确确实实地把毛泽东同志的教导当作一切行动的最高指示。
