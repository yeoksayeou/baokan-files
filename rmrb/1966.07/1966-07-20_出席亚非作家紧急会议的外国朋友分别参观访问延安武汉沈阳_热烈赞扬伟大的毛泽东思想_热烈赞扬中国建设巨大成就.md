Foreign friends attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers visited Yan'an, Wuhan, and Shenyang, where they enthusiastically praised the great thoughts of Mao Zedong and the tremendous achievements of China's construction.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 19th: A group of foreign friends attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers arrived in Yan'an, the holy land of the Chinese revolution, on July 18th by special plane to visit and tour. The guests were warmly welcomed by the responsible officials of the Yan'an District and Yan'an City, as well as over a thousand people from various circles in Yan'an.

In the evening, Tu Jinzhang, Deputy Commissioner of the Yan'an District, held a welcome banquet for the foreign friends who had come to Yan'an. In his speech at the banquet, he expressed on behalf of the Yan'an people a warm welcome to the friends from various countries. He said, Yan'an is where the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao had long fought. The Yan'an people have deeply felt through long-term revolutionary struggles that Mao Zedong Thought is a brilliant, creative, and comprehensive development of Marxism-Leninism. Following Chairman Mao means victory. The Yan'an people have an infinite love for the great Chairman Mao and an infinite faith in the great Mao Zedong Thought. Whether in the past, present, or future, the Yan'an people will forever be loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought and forever follow the great leader Chairman Mao.

Huang Trung Thong, representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, said at the banquet, In Yan'an, the respected Chairman Mao Zedong wrote many important works of historical significance, which creatively applied and developed Marxism-Leninism. He said, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have strongly supported the Vietnamese people, which is the friendship between the two peoples of Vietnam and China, as Chairman Ho Chi Minh once said, it is a "comrade plus brother" fighting friendship.

Mrs. Grant, representative of Sierra Leone, said, Our Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers has achieved brilliant success. Splitism and their imperialist masters have suffered a fatal blow. She shouted, "Long live the great leader of the heroic Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong!"

During the banquet, some foreign friends sang revolutionary songs and repeatedly toasted to Chairman Mao's health. Some guests also shouted at the banquet, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Down with imperialism! Down with old and new colonialism!" "Down with revisionism!"

The Asian and African foreign friends in Yan'an visited the Yan'an Revolutionary Memorial Hall, the place where Chairman Mao once lived on Phoenix Mountain, and Yangjialing and Zaoyuan.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 19th: Some representatives attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers visited factories in Wuhan, watched performances, and held a symposium with Wuhan's literary and art workers.

The foreign friends visited Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, Wuhan Diesel Engine Plant, and Changjiang Toothbrush Factory in Wuhan. These factories were built by the Chinese people who held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle.

The foreign friends visited the iron-making plant, steel-making plant, and initial rolling mill at Wuhan Steel. When they heard that some plants were completely designed and built by China itself, they were very excited. When leaving the factory, these friends repeatedly shook hands with the workers to express their congratulations. Some foreign friends got off the car again and went to the workers who came to see them off, shouting in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

After visiting the Heavy Machine Tool Plant, Nepalese representative Shidi Chalan Shreshta told reporters that he was most inspired by the deputy director of the plant saying that the plant is exporting machines to other countries. He said, for Asian and African countries, seeing China develop so rapidly is a pleasant thing. China's development is an inspiration to all Asian and African countries, especially to us.

The foreign friends also watched the revolutionary modern opera "Red Guards of Honghu Lake" performed by the Hubei Provincial Experimental Opera Troupe and the acrobatic performance by the Wuhan Acrobatic Troupe, and held a symposium with the two art troupes. Many foreign friends praised Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thoughts in the symposium and enthusiastically praised the achievements made by Chinese literary and art workers in implementing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction. Malaysian representative Sharma said, the creation of the opera "Red Guards of Honghu Lake" and Wang Yuzhen's singing fully demonstrated the correctness of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," vividly embodying the spirit of the "Talks." Such a revolutionary theme is not only very important to the Chinese people but also very important to the Malaysian people (including the people of Singapore), to the Asian and African people, and to the people of the world. Under the guidance of the great revolutionary leader Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, the path chosen by literary and art workers is the correct path to build a new era of culture. Rwandan representative Mungarulire Pierre said, from this opera reflecting revolutionary struggles, from the beginning, I saw the oppressed people fighting revolution guided by Mao Zedong Thought. I think this is a great inspiration for us. We must fight, and we must have ideological guidance. This can only be the guidance of proletarian ideology. With such ideological guidance, we will definitely lead us to victory. The foreign friends also listened with great interest to the famous acrobat Xia Juhua reporting her growth under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought. Xia Juhua's vivid story deeply moved the friends from various countries. As soon as she finished her introduction, the friends from various countries rushed forward to shake hands with her, congratulating her on the outstanding achievements she had made under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

The representatives left Wuhan by train tonight for Changsha.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 19th: The Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, Liao Chengzhi, held a reception to welcome the foreign friends attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers.

    越南民主共和国代表黄忠通在宴会上说，在延安，敬爱的毛泽东主席写了许多具有历史意义的重要著作，这些著作创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义。他说，在以毛主席为首的中国共产党领导下，中国人民已经非常强有力地支持了越南人民，这是越中两国人民之间的友谊，正如胡志明主席曾经说过的，这是“同志加兄弟”的战斗友谊。
