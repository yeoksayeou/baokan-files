Speech by Chen Wencheng, Head of the Delegation, at the Capital's Rally of Various Circles of People Supporting the Vietnamese People's Anti-American National Salvation Struggle

New China News Agency, July 22nd

The following is the full text of the speech by Chen Wencheng, Head of the Delegation of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam, at the Capital's Rally of Various Circles of People Supporting the Vietnamese People's Anti-American National Salvation Struggle:

Honorable Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Honorable Premier Zhou Enlai, Honorable Chairman Zhu De, Honorable Vice Chairman Song Qingling, Honorable Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Honorable General Secretary Deng Xiaoping, Honorable members of the presidium, Honorable Ambassador Chen Ziping, distinguished representatives and friends:

First of all, allow us to convey the warmest and most militant greetings of solidarity from the people of South Vietnam to all the representatives and friends attending this solemn rally today.

At a time when the Vietnamese people are facing an extremely grave situation due to the U.S. imperialists' policy of intensifying their aggression in South and North Vietnam, the "Letter to the Nation" issued by Chairman Ho Chi Minh on July 17, 1966, is of great significance. It is a declaration of national salvation, a call to arms for the 31 million Vietnamese people to advance and annihilate the American aggressors and their lackeys. It is a resolute voice shining with the light of justice, expressing the iron will of the entire Vietnamese people to never be slaves and to fulfill the mission of liberating the South, defending the North, and reunifying the country, as entrusted by their beloved homeland.

Distinguished representatives and friends:

The people of South Vietnam have, in their long revolutionary struggle, repeatedly responded to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's calls with glorious victories. In 1945, the people of South Vietnam, known as the "Steel Wall of the Motherland," stood at the forefront of the resistance against the French colonialists. They responded to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to "sacrifice everything but never be slaves" and rose up to fight fiercely against the French invaders, contributing to the nation's victory at Dien Bien Phu, which shook the heavens and the earth.

Since then, the people of South Vietnam have been steadfast in their national salvation oath, advancing bravely and decisively defeating the American aggressors and their lackeys, achieving a series of brilliant victories that have inspired the entire nation and friends on five continents. They have smashed the U.S. imperialists' neo-colonialist policy of enslavement; defeated their "special war"; foiled the first step of the partial war launched by the U.S. in South Vietnam, the "dry season offensive," leaving them in a desperate situation. In the first half of 1966 alone, when the U.S. imperialists concentrated their forces to the maximum, attempting to achieve the decisive phase of their "dry season offensive" plan, the military and civilian population of South Vietnam engaged in 9,000 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing nearly 112,000 enemy troops, including 47,000 U.S. invaders and mercenaries, equivalent to one-fifth of the total U.S. troops in South Vietnam, inflicting a heavy defeat on the enemy. Alongside military victories, the people of South Vietnam have also launched a powerful political struggle from the countryside to the cities, making the political crisis of the U.S. and its lackeys extremely serious. In early July 1966, after the U.S. aggressors bombed the suburbs of Hanoi and Haiphong, the military and civilian population of South Vietnam, filled with hatred, struck back fiercely at the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, determined to make them pay the blood debt. For example, they repeatedly struck the enemy on the 13th Highway, attacked the enemy's airbase in Can Tho, and recently attacked the U.S. Marine Corps in Quang Tri, among other actions.

The series of victories achieved by the military and civilian population of South Vietnam has powerfully demonstrated that the political and military lines, strategic and tactical guidance of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam are completely correct. We have already and are continuing to achieve victories, and we will certainly defeat the U.S. imperialists' aggression. The victories of the military and civilian population of South Vietnam also prove that people's war is invincible; it can completely defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressors and their lackeys.

Distinguished representatives and friends:

Despite the U.S. imperialists' desperate attempts to salvage the situation, such as accelerating the deployment of more troops and more war equipment into South Vietnam to further expand the war, intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam, committing extremely barbaric crimes that have outraged all decent people in the world; despite the U.S. imperialists' ceaseless cries for "peace talks," "unconditional discussions," and other deceitful lies, and driving their followers like Wilson, Sato, Tito, and others to peddle the U.S. "peace" fraud, attempting to cover up their crimes; despite their brazen bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, trying to exert "pressure" to force the Vietnamese people to the negotiating table and conduct talks according to their absurd conditions; the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys can neither intimidate nor deceive anyone. If the U.S. imperialists truly want to resolve the Vietnamese issue, then they must accept the stance of the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and must demonstrate this with concrete actions. Apart from this, there is no other way. The March 22, 1965, declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has already stated: "The people of South Vietnam and their armed forces are determined that as long as they have not achieved their basic goals, they will never lay down their weapons. Their goals are: independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. The people of South Vietnam are determined to continue to strike back at the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, and they will certainly win the final victory."

The people of South Vietnam enthusiastically respond to Chairman Ho's call. Under the glorious banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, with deep hatred for the American aggressors and traitorous lackeys, they will continue to charge forward with the spirit of a blazing inferno, bravely attacking the enemy and striking back with a hundredfold, a thousandfold force, together with the 17 million compatriots in the North, striving to realize the call of the beloved leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho: "In the new situation, we resolutely unite as one, fearing no hardships and sacrifices, and resolutely fulfill our nation's glorious historical mission: defeat the American aggressors!"

Distinguished representatives and friends:

In our own struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, the people of South Vietnam have already received the most resolute, powerful, and effective sympathy and support from the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party, led by the esteemed Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on August 29, 1963, the Chinese government's statement issued on July 3, 1966, and today's statement by Chairman Liu have clearly shown that the steadfast position of the great 700 million Chinese people is to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation until complete victory is achieved. Today, this large-scale gathering of more than a million Chinese people, filled with a fighting spirit, is one of the many concrete expressions of the solidarity and shared fate in the struggle between the Vietnamese people and the fraternal Chinese people. We, the people of South Vietnam, understand better than anyone the immense and most effective support that the Chinese people have given to our struggle.

Here, allow us to once again express the sincere gratitude of the people of South Vietnam and the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party.

On this occasion, allow us to also express the heartfelt thanks of the people of South Vietnam to the socialist countries and the progressive people of the world, including the American people, who have given valuable support and assistance to the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam for victory.

Distinguished representatives and friends:

The people of South Vietnam are firmly convinced that with the great unity of the entire Vietnamese people, with the tradition of a just and unyielding struggle, with the ever-increasing sympathy and support of the socialist countries and the people of the world who love peace and uphold justice, the people of South Vietnam will ultimately achieve a brilliant victory. No matter how many more troops, whether 500,000 or more, the U.S. imperialists send, and no matter what "new" strategies and tactics they use, or what modern weapons they employ, they cannot save the U.S. imperialists from the fate of suffering a heavy and shameful defeat!

The Vietnamese people will win!
The U.S. imperialists will be defeated!
Long live the indestructible fighting unity between the peoples of Vietnam and China!

    在首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会上
    陈文成团长的讲话
    新华社二十二日讯　越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长陈文成在首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会上的讲话，全文如下：敬爱的刘少奇主席，敬爱的周恩来总理，敬爱的朱德委员长，敬爱的宋庆龄副主席，敬爱的董必武副主席，敬爱的邓小平总书记，敬爱的主席团的各位朋友，敬爱的陈子平大使，各位代表和朋友们：
    首先，请允许我们向出席今天这个庄严大会的各位代表和朋友们转达越南南方人民最热烈的战斗团结的敬意。
    正当越南人民面临着由于美帝国主义强化在越南南方和北方的侵略战争的政策造成极其严重的局势的时候，胡志明主席在一九六六年七月十七日发表的《告全国同胞书》，具有非常重大的意义。这是救国的宣言，是动员三千一百万越南人民冲向前，消灭美国强盗及其走狗的雄壮的战斗号角，是闪耀着正义光辉的坚强的声音，它最集中地表达了全越南人民决不当奴隶，决心完成可爱的祖国所赋予的解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国的使命的钢铁般的意志。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    越南南方人民在长期的革命斗争中，经常以显赫的战功来响应胡志明主席的号召。一九四五年，被誉称为“祖国铜墙”的越南南方人民站在反对法国殖民主义者的抗战的最前列。他们响应胡志明主席的“我们宁愿牺牲一切，决不甘当奴隶”的号召，奋起同法国侵略军展开了激烈的战斗，同全国人民一道，为赢得震撼山河的奠边府胜利作出了贡献。
    从那时候起，越南南方人民一直履行着自己救国的誓言，勇往直前，坚决打败美国侵略强盗及其走狗，并且取得了使全国人民和五大洲朋友莫不深感振奋的无比辉煌的胜利：粉碎了美帝国主义的新殖民主义的奴役政策；打败了它们所推行的“特种战争”；挫败了作为美国在越南南方所发动的局部战争的第一个步骤的“旱季攻势”，使它们深陷于日暮途穷的困境。仅在一九六六年上半年，也就是美帝国主义最大限度地集中兵力，妄图实现它们在“旱季攻势”计划中的决定性阶段，越南南方军民共进行战斗九千次，打死打伤和俘虏敌人近十一万二千名，其中包括美国侵略军和帮凶军四万七千多名，即相当于在越南南方的美军总数的五分之一，使敌人遭到十分惨重的失败。伴随着军事上的胜利，越南南方人民还从农村到城市大力开展政治斗争，使美国及其走狗的政治危机十分严重。一九六六年七月初，即在美国强盗轰炸河内和海防的郊区之后，越南南方军民满怀仇恨，给予美国强盗及其走狗迎头痛击，坚决要它们偿还血债。如在第十三号公路上给予敌人接连不断的打击，袭击芹苴敌军机场，以及最近在广治袭击美国海军陆战队等等。
    越南南方军民所取得的一系列胜利，雄辩地证明了越南南方民族解放阵线所实行的政治路线和军事路线，战略指导和战术指导，都是完全正确的。我们已经和正在取得胜利，并且必将战胜美帝国主义的侵略的政治路线、军事路线及其局部战争的战略战术。越南南方军民所取得的胜利还证明了，人民战争是所向无敌的，它完全可以打败美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    尽管美帝国主义想尽一切办法来挽救败局，即加紧准备增派军队并把更多的战争装备运进越南南方，以便进一步扩大战争，加强轰炸越南北方，犯下了世界上一切善良的人们莫不公愤的非常野蛮的罪行；尽管美帝国主义不间断地叫嚷什么“和谈”，“无条件讨论”等骗人的鬼话，并且驱使它的追随者威尔逊、佐藤、铁托……等等四出奔走，兜售美国的“和平”骗局，借以掩盖它的罪恶；尽管它们悍然轰炸河内和海防，妄图施加“压力”，迫使越南人民到谈判桌上来，按照它们的荒诞条件来进行谈判；美帝国主义及其走狗也绝对吓唬不了和欺骗不了任何人。如果美帝国主义真正想要解决越南问题，那末，它就必须接受越南民主共和国政府四项主张的立场和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，并须以实际行动来表明。除此以外，别无其他道路。越南南方民族解放阵线一九六五年三月二十二日的声明已经指出：“越南南方人民和他们的武装部队下定决心，只要还没有达到自己的基本目标，就永远不会放下自己手中的武器。他们的目标就是：独立、民主、和平和中立，越南南方人民决心继续给予美国侵略者及其仆从以严重打击，他们定将赢得最后胜利”。
    越南南方人民热烈响应胡主席的号召，他们在越南南方民族解放阵线的光荣旗帜下，怀着对美国侵略强盗及卖国走狗的深仇大恨，将继续以烈火冲天的气魄，勇敢地向敌人冲锋陷阵，给予它们以一百倍、一千倍的打击，同可爱的祖国的一千七百万的北方骨肉同胞一起，力争实现越南民族敬爱的领袖胡主席的号召：“在新的形势下，我们坚决同心协力，不怕一切艰苦和牺牲，坚决完成我们民族光荣的历史使命：战胜美国侵略强盗！……”
    各位代表和朋友们：
    在我们自己的反美救国斗争中，越南南方人民已经得到以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党最坚决、最有力和最有效的同情和支持。毛泽东主席在一九六三年八月二十九日的声明、中国政府一九六六年七月三日发表的声明和今天刘主席的声明，已经肯定地表明伟大的七亿中国人民一贯的钢铁般的立场是，坚决支援越南人民抗美救国斗争直到取得完全胜利。今天，这个拥有一百多万中国人民参加的充满战斗气氛的大规模集会，就是越南人民和兄弟的中国人民团结战斗和生死与共的情谊的许多具体表现之一。我们越南南方人民对于中国人民所给予我们的斗争的无比重大和最有效的支援，比谁都要了解得更加清楚。
    在这里，请允许我们再一次表达越南南方人民、越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党的真诚谢意。
    借此机会，也请允许我们对曾经给予越南南方人民必胜的正义斗争以宝贵的支持和帮助的社会主义国家和包括美国人民在内的全世界进步人民，表达越南南方人民的衷心感谢。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    越南南方人民坚信，有着越南全民大团结的力量，有着正义和英勇不屈的斗争传统，有着社会主义国家和全世界爱好和平和主持正义的人民日益巨大的同情和支持，越南南方人民最后必将取得辉煌的胜利。不管美帝国主义再增派五十万或者更多的军队，也不管它们采用什么“新奇”的战略和战术，使用什么现代化武器，也都不能挽救美帝国主义必将遭到惨重和可耻失败的命运！
    越南人民必胜！
    美帝国主义必败！
    越中两国人民牢不可破的战斗团结万岁！
