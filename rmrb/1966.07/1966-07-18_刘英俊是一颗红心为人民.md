Liu Yingjun sacrificed his life to save others and died a glorious death. I was deeply moved and also felt a great sense of loss. Seeing his portrait, an unforgettable incident from a few months ago came back to me.

That day, it was windy and snowing heavily. I had just returned from a meeting at the neighborhood committee. As soon as I entered the house, I noticed that two of my children were missing. My heart raced with worry. My son, Qimin, was not yet four years old, and my daughter, Yanjun, who was nine, had polio and had difficulty walking. If they got lost and fell into a snowdrift, what would happen? Just as I was thinking this, the door creaked open, and Liu Yingjun, covered in snow, entered with my son in his arms and my daughter by his side. He put the children down and enthusiastically said, "Auntie, I saw the two children on the road, shivering and unable to walk. I was afraid of the traffic, so I brought them back to you." I was so touched that I didn't know what to say. I quickly invited him to sit on the kang (bed) to rest. But he said, "I still have to go to study," and rushed out the door before I could stop him.

Back in the house, I looked at my nine-year-old daughter and couldn't help but think back to when I was nine...

It was during the time when the Japanese devils occupied the Northeast. Landlords, traitors, and running dogs were rampant everywhere. We poor people suffered greatly and could hardly survive. I followed my mother, fleeing from place to place. Finally, we rented a dilapidated room in Liaoyang to live in. One day, my mother sent me to the landlord's house to deliver the rent grain. As soon as I stepped into the doorway, the landlord's two guard dogs pounced on me ferociously. I was so young and scared that I screamed and fell to the ground, scattering the grain everywhere. The wolfhounds pounced on me, tearing my clothes and biting my thigh until it bled profusely...

The more I thought about the past hardships, the more I felt that living in the era of Mao Zedong is truly blessed!

Today, Comrade Liu Yingjun has sacrificed his life, but his spirit of a red heart for the people will forever live in the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. I often tell my children about Comrade Liu Yingjun's deeds, educating them to learn from Uncle Liu Yingjun, and to grow up to be like him, "completely" and "thoroughly" for the people, becoming red revolutionary successors.

　　刘英俊是一颗红心为人民
　　王文琴
    刘英俊舍身救人、光荣牺牲以后，我又感动又难受。看到他的遗象，几个月前一件让人难忘的事，又出现在我的眼前。
    那天，大风大雪，我从居民委员会开会回来。一进屋，就发现两个孩子不见了，我心里急得火燎燎的。我的儿子启敏还不满四岁，九岁的女儿艳军得过小儿麻痹症，走路不方便，万一迷失方向，陷到雪窝里可咋办呀！正想着，突然“吱”的一声，门开了，满身雪花的刘英俊一手抱着启敏，一手拉着艳军，走进门来。他放下孩子，非常热情地说：“大婶，我在马路上看见两个孩子冻得走不动了，怕路上车多出事，就给您送来了。”我听了，心里感动得不知说什么才好，连忙叫他到炕上歇歇。可是，他说了声“我还要参加学习呢”，就一溜烟似地跑了，我在后面叫也叫不住。
    回到屋里，我看着九岁的女儿，不由得想起了我九岁那年……
    那还是日本鬼子侵占东北的时候，地主、汉奸、狗腿子们，到处横行霸道。咱们穷人家受苦受难，简直没法子生存。我跟着我妈东奔西逃，好容易在辽阳租了一间破房子住下来。有一天，我妈叫我到地主家送房租粮，刚迈进大门口，地主的两只看家狗，凶狠狠地朝我扑来。我年纪小，一见狗咬来了，吓得“哇”的一声，倒在地上，粮食撒得满地都是。狼狗窜上来，撕烂了我的衣服，把我大腿咬得鲜血直流……。
    越是忆苦思甜，我越感到今天生长在毛泽东时代，真是无比的幸福啊！
    今天，刘英俊同志牺牲了，可是他那一颗红心为人民的精神，却永远活在我们贫下中农的心里。我时常给我孩子讲刘英俊同志生前的事迹，教育他们向刘英俊叔叔学习，长大了象刘英俊那样，“完全”、“彻底”为人民，当个红色的革命接班人。
