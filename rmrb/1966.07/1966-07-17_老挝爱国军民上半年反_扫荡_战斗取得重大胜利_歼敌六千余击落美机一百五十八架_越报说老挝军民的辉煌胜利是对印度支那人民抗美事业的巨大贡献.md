Laotian patriotic military and civilians achieved major victories in the first half of the year in their battles against the "sweeping" operations by the United States and its lackeys.

According to incomplete statistics, in the first six months of this year, Laotian patriotic military and civilians engaged in 460 battles, annihilating 6,241 enemy soldiers. Of these, 4,180 were killed or wounded, 466 were captured, and 1,595 surrendered. Among the annihilated enemy forces, nine companies were completely wiped out, fifteen battalions were severely damaged, and many battalion command posts were destroyed. Additionally, 158 American aggressor aircraft were shot down, and 126 were damaged. A large amount of weapons were also seized.

During these six months, the patriotic military and civilians in the central and southern regions of Laos fought exceptionally well.

The Pathet Lao radio station also reported that on July 8, the patriotic military and civilians in the Mang Chanh area of Sanxay Province, Laos, shot down and damaged one American F-105 jet fighter each.

The New China News Agency reported from Hanoi on July 15 that the Vietnamese newspaper "People's Daily" published a commentary on July 15, warmly congratulating the Laotian patriotic military and civilians on their splendid victory of annihilating more than 6,000 enemy soldiers in the first half of the year. The commentary pointed out that the victory achieved by the brotherly Laotian military and civilians is a positive and significant contribution to the anti-American struggle of the peoples of Indochina. At the same time, it is a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression against Laos. The plots of the United States and its lackeys to defeat the Laotian patriotic armed forces and encroach upon the liberated areas have failed.

The commentary said that the various patriotic armed forces of Laos, after undergoing many arduous battles, have become stronger. Their political and ideological awareness, as well as their tactical and technical levels, have all improved. Under the correct leadership of the Laotian Patriotic Front, the people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation is developing continuously.

The commentary said: The peoples of Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam have displayed the heroic spirit and invincible power of the Indochinese peoples in their victorious struggle against their common enemy, U.S. imperialism. No matter how desperately the U.S. imperialists struggle, they will inevitably suffer a complete defeat. The peoples of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia will certainly achieve complete victory.

According to the New China News Agency's report from Khamkeut, the Pathet Lao radio station broadcasted that recently, 8,911 people in the Mangxian and Samuoyan areas of Luang Prabang Province, Laos, rose up to destroy the "concentration zones" established by the enemy and returned to their homes. The radio station said that the local authorities in the liberated areas of Laos, in accordance with the policy of the Central Committee of the Laotian Patriotic Front, provided these returning people with a large amount of food, daily necessities, and production tools. The people expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Laotian Patriotic Front. Currently, they are actively engaged in production.
