	“Revolution means struggle, struggle means happiness.”
	Zhang Guoliang, a model worker from Jilin Province and Changchun City, an engineer at Changchun Automobile Factory.

	The deeds of Comrade Liu Yingjun tell us that one's life should be a life of revolution. His deeds also tell us: “Revolution means struggle, struggle means happiness.”

	In the current life-and-death class struggle between the restoration of capitalism and the proletariat's counter-restoration, the heroic deeds of Comrade Liu Yingjun are another heavy blow to the anti-party, anti-socialist clique. The bourgeois “authorities” slander our workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works as “vulgarization,” “simplification,” and “pragmatism.” However, Comrade Liu Yingjun's brave sacrifice once again proves that once the workers, peasants, and soldiers grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they can generate tremendous material force; they can create earth-shaking heroic deeds. Do you bourgeois “authorities” have such a heart? Do you have such courage in the face of danger? You do not, and you cannot. Class nature determines that you cannot understand our proletariat's heroic feats.

	Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, it is the steering wheel of our revolution. Wherever Mao Zedong Thought shines, there is light. The army, having grasped Mao Zedong Thought, has become an extremely proletarianized and combat-ready force, producing countless heroes like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ou Yanghai, and Liu Yingjun—Chairman Mao's good soldiers. We automobile workers, having grasped Mao Zedong Thought, dare to break old frameworks and scale new heights. With Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, we have created the Red Flag brand three-row high-level sedan and new type of heavy-duty truck, greatly advancing China's automobile production.

	Countless facts prove that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a tremendous material force. I must strive to be like Comrade Liu Yingjun, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao, always revolutionary, thoroughly revolutionary.

    “革命就要斗争，斗争就是幸福”
    吉林省、长春市五好职工标兵，长春汽车厂工人工程师　张国良
    刘英俊同志的事迹告诉我们，人的一生，应该是革命的一生。他的事迹还告诉我们：“革命就要斗争，斗争就是幸福”。
    在当前这场资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的你死我活的阶级斗争中，刘英俊同志的英雄事迹，是对反党反社会主义黑帮的又一次沉重打击。资产阶级“权威”老爷们诬蔑我们工农兵学习毛主席著作是“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”，而刘英俊同志的英勇献身，再一次证明，工农兵一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就能产生巨大的物质力量；就能创造出惊天动地的英雄事迹。资产阶级“权威”老爷们，你们能有这样的胸怀吗？你们能有这样的临危不惧的勇气吗？你们一点也没有，也不可能有。阶级的本性决定了你们不能理解我们无产阶级的英雄壮举。
    毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，是我们革命的方向盘，毛泽东思想照到哪里哪里亮。解放军掌握了毛泽东思想，成为一支战无不胜、攻无不克的非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的队伍，出现了千千万万个象雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、刘英俊这样的毛主席的好战士。我们汽车工人掌握了毛泽东思想，就敢于打破旧框框，攀登新高峰。以毛泽东思想为指针，我们创造出了红旗牌三排座高级轿车和新型载重汽车，使我国的汽车生产有了很大发展。
    无数事实证明，毛泽东思想一旦被群众掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量。我一定要做到象刘英俊同志那样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，永远革命，彻底革命。
