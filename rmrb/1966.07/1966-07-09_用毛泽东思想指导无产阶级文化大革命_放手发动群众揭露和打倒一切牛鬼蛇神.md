The Hubei Provincial Party Committee issued a call at the activist representatives' meeting in the Wuhan area to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and mobilize the masses to expose and overthrow all monsters and demons.

In this movement, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works from beginning to end; all levels of party organizations must enthusiastically lead and support the mass movement; rely on the leftists, raise the leftists, strengthen the leftists, unite the majority of the masses, and isolate and strike the rightists to the greatest extent; use the methods of big debates, big-character posters, big discussions, and big struggles to thoroughly expose and refute the reactionary words and deeds of anti-party and anti-socialist elements, and smash their counter-revolutionary restoration plots.

Editor's Note: The Hubei Provincial Party Committee held a meeting of activists for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, calling on the entire province to deepen the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The meeting was well-conducted, pointing out the direction, summarizing experiences, explaining policies, and having a significant guiding role in the healthy development of the movement in the future.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to achieve greater victories, we must first distinguish between friends and enemies, unite with true friends, and strike at true enemies. Great Mao Zedong Thought is our most powerful weapon for grasping the direction, distinguishing between friends and enemies, and achieving victory. In the movement, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, mobilize the masses, and firmly rely on the proletarian leftists. We must unite with the vast majority of revolutionary masses and direct the main thrust of the struggle against a handful of anti-party and anti-socialist bourgeois representatives, concentrating our forces to solve the main contradictions.

Only organized and led actions are the most effective revolutionary actions. We revolutionary masses must, under the party's leadership, organize more tightly, unite more closely, heighten class consciousness, heighten class vigilance, and prevent the enemy from exploiting loopholes. We must closely watch the enemy's every move, timely expose their plots, and never allow them to fish in troubled waters and gain advantages.

The party's policies are our magic weapons for defeating the enemy. In the Cultural Revolution, we must consistently implement the party's policies, pay attention to the methods and strategies of struggle.

Arming the broad masses with Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the Cultural Revolution. In the process of the Cultural Revolution, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind, resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and solve all problems in the movement. When the broad masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they will have clear minds and eyes, distinguish between friends and enemies, have a firm stand, and be full of fighting spirit. No matter what tricks the enemy plays, they will not be deceived. No matter what obstacles they encounter in the struggle, they will overcome all difficulties and strive for victory.

New China News Agency, Wuhan, July 8th: The Hubei Provincial Party Committee recently held a meeting of activists for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan area, calling on the entire province's workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and all revolutionaries to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply develop the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, mobilize the masses, and use the methods of big debates, big-character posters, big discussions, and big struggles to thoroughly expose and overthrow all monsters and demons.

Attending this meeting were representatives of teachers, students, and staff from large and medium-sized schools in the Wuhan area, representatives of workers from large and medium-sized enterprises, and representatives from government agencies and organizations, totaling 6,500 people.

The meeting was presided over by Xu Daoji, a member of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee Secretariat. Wang Shucheng, a member of the Secretariat, made a mobilization speech on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee, titled "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Deeply Develop the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Wang Shucheng said in his speech that at present, Hubei Province, like other parts of the country, has been swept by a revolutionary storm that sweeps away all anti-party and anti-socialist monsters and demons, presenting a very good socialist revolutionary situation. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals is soaring. They not only actively participate in national and provincial-level battles but are also widely mobilizing to expose and criticize the monsters and demons in their local areas and units. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses is so high, and the revolutionary initiative is so strong, like a sudden storm, swift and powerful.

Wang Shucheng pointed out that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the leadership of party committees at all levels must have the determination for self-revolution and the determination to completely break with all exploitative class thoughts. They must use Mao Zedong Thought to examine their own thoughts and work, enthusiastically welcome the masses' criticism, and correct mistakes. Only in this way can they stand at the forefront of the movement and lead the masses to fight a victorious battle. The attitude towards the revolutionary mass movement—whether to support or oppose—is an important sign to distinguish between revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries. If someone in the movement is stubborn, suppresses democracy, suppresses criticism, and even retaliates, party committees at all levels must promptly, resolutely, and seriously deal with it and support the revolutionary masses.

Wang Shucheng said that Chairman Mao's works are the highest instructions for all our work. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the revolutionary storm, party committees at all levels, work teams, Communist Party members, Young Communist League members, and revolutionary activists must all regard leading the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as their glorious task.

To lead this great revolution well, Wang Shucheng emphasized the following points:

First, throughout the movement, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. We must study with class feelings and with problems in mind, studying while using. In the struggle, no matter what difficult problems we encounter, we must consult Chairman Mao's works. Using Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze everything, using Mao Zedong Thought to mobilize the masses and transform the old world, we will be invincible.

We must advance in the struggle, and in the struggle, we must study Chairman Mao's works. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must take Mao Zedong Thought as its guide to achieve victory. We must actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in this great revolutionary struggle, closely combining struggle with study. Struggle is the best study, and study is for struggle.

Second, mobilize the masses to thoroughly overthrow all monsters and demons. Party organizations at all levels must personally go to the front lines and actively lead the movement. They must enthusiastically support the revolutionary mass movement, take the lead in exposing and criticizing, and dare to "burn themselves." Whether to mobilize the masses or not is the question of whether to make a revolution or not, whether to make a true revolution or a false revolution.

We must mobilize the masses to use the methods of big debates, big-character posters, big discussions, and big struggles to thoroughly expose problems, expose them deeply and clearly, and not suppress criticism. Communist Party members and Young Communist League members must stand at the forefront of the revolutionary struggle.

This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution struggle is directed against a handful of bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party and a handful of anti-party, anti-socialist, counter-revolutionary bourgeois intellectuals. Therefore, how to assess intellectuals and what policy to adopt is a very important issue. Everyone must seriously study Chairman Mao's speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China in March 1957. It must be read carefully, and the masses must be mobilized to read and discuss it seriously. What are the leftists, middle-of-the-roaders, and rightists among intellectuals? Chairman Mao's words are very clear. Leftists are a minority, middle-of-the-roaders make up the majority, and rightists, who are firmly anti-party and anti-socialist, are an extreme minority. Leftists, including Communist Party members and sympathizers outside the party, are relatively familiar with Marxism and stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint. These people are a minority but are the core force of the movement. In the movement, we must rely on the leftists, raise the leftists, strengthen the leftists, and raise their prestige, promoting them to leadership positions. Middle-of-the-roaders are the most numerous. They have not taken a firm stand and waver left and right when encountering storms. We must start from the desire for unity, solve contradictions through criticism or struggle, and achieve new unity on a new basis. The thrust of the struggle should not be directed at them. For the broad masses of intellectuals who came from the old society, as long as they do not oppose the party or socialism, we must adopt the policy of unity, education, and transformation. For their shortcomings and mistakes, we must solve them through criticism and self-criticism. We must educate and transform these people in the movement. When the revolutionary high tide comes, the leftist forces form, and we correctly implement the policy, the middle-of-the-roaders can lean towards the leftists. In this way, we can form an overwhelming advantage and isolate the rightists to the greatest extent. Rightists are those who oppose the party and socialism; they do not like our proletarian dictatorship state, yearn for the old society, and when they get the chance, they stir up trouble, trying to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old China. Such people are a minority. Although their numbers are small, their strength is greater than their numbers. We must resolutely fight them down and expose them.

Third, representative meetings (such as teacher-student-staff representative meetings, worker representative meetings, etc.) are a good form of organizing leftist forces and uniting the majority of the masses. We must mobilize the masses, fully practice democracy, and elect good representatives. The role of representatives is to be the backbone, bridge, and leading role of activists among the masses. The Provincial Party Committee calls on all representatives to be models in studying Chairman Mao's works, reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being good students, good soldiers, and good propagandists of Chairman Mao.

Fourth, policies and strategies are the lifeblood of the party. We must remember Chairman Mao's instructions: "Policies and strategies are the lifeblood of the party. Leading comrades at all levels must fully pay attention and never be careless." "To be good at turning the party's policies into the actions of the masses, to be good at making every movement and struggle of ours not only understood by leading cadres but also understood and mastered by the broad masses, this is a Marxist-Leninist leadership art. Whether our work makes mistakes or not, the boundary is here."

We must remember Chairman Mao's instructions, mobilize the masses, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end; distinguish between the two types of contradictions, clarify left, middle, and right, and the policies towards them. This is the top priority that party organizations, work teams, and representative meetings should grasp. We must believe in the masses and give them the policies. Chairman Mao's words and the party's policies are the easiest for the broad masses to accept.

We must fight down and expose the anti-party and anti-socialist elements. We must use the method of presenting facts and reasoning to thoroughly expose their reactionary words and deeds and their ugly faces, thoroughly refute their fallacies, make them thoroughly isolated, and truly exposed, so that no one listens to their nonsense. Only then can we truly fight them down.

Fifth, strengthen party leadership. To carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must mobilize the masses and launch mass movements, and at the same time, we must strengthen party leadership. We must understand: "The Communist Party of China is the core of the entire Chinese people. Without such a core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." Similarly, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can only achieve victory under the strong leadership of the party.

Sixth, this year is the first year of our country's third five-year plan. The storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will surely promote the development of all work. We workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals must actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, further raise our awareness, summon up our strength, overcome difficulties, achieve a great harvest in agriculture this year, and strive to complete this year's production and construction plan ahead of schedule.

Seventh, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire province will be carried out universally using the method of combining points with surfaces. The entire movement will ultimately focus on studying Chairman Mao's works, transforming worldviews, and realizing the thought revolution of the people.

Wang Shucheng finally said that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, all the big and small "three families" will be thoroughly destroyed, and all monsters and demons will be thoroughly overthrown. In the great waves of class struggle, the ranks of proletarian intellectuals are growing stronger day by day, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the cultural and ideological fields will disappear forever.

The representatives at the meeting were full of revolutionary enthusiasm and fighting spirit, unanimously supporting the Provincial Party Committee's call to action, and expressing their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further strengthen the forces of the proletarian revolutionary faction, unite more than 95% of the masses, and further develop the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly overthrow all anti-party and anti-socialist monsters and demons, and not retreat until complete victory is achieved.

    湖北省委在武汉地区积极分子代表会上发出号召
    用毛泽东思想指导无产阶级文化大革命  放手发动群众揭露和打倒一切牛鬼蛇神
    在这场运动中，自始至终都要活学活用毛主席著作；各级党组织必须满腔热情地领导和支持群众运动；依靠左派，提高左派，壮大左派，团结大多数群众，最大限度地孤立和打击右派；采取大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，彻底揭露和驳倒反党反社会主义分子的反动言行，粉碎他们的反革命复辟阴谋
    编者按：湖北省委召开无产阶级文化大革命积极分子代表会议，号召全省深入开展无产阶级文化大革命运动。会议开得很好，指明了方向，总结了经验，交代了政策，对今后运动的深入健康的发展有很大的指导作用。
    在这场文化大革命中，要取得更大的成效，获得更大的胜利，首先必须分清敌我，团结真正的朋友，打击真正的敌人。伟大的毛泽东思想就是我们掌握方向，识别敌我，争取胜利的最锐利的武器。在运动中，我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，放手发动群众，坚定地依靠无产阶级左派，团结绝大多数革命群众，把主要斗争锋芒指向一小撮反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物，集中力量解决主要矛盾。
    有组织、有领导的行动，才是最有效的革命行动。我们革命群众一定要在党的领导下，更严密地组织起来，更紧密地团结起来，提高阶级嗅觉，提高阶级警惕，防止敌人钻空子。我们要密切注视阶级敌人的一举一动，及时识破他们的一切阴谋诡计，决不能让他们混水摸鱼，捞到便宜。
    党的政策是我们克敌制胜的法宝。在文化大革命中，我们要始终如一地贯彻执行党的政策，讲究斗争方法和斗争策略。
    用毛泽东思想武装广大群众，是文化大革命取得胜利的根本保证。我们要在文化大革命的过程中，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，坚决按毛主席的指示办事，解决运动中的一切问题。广大群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就能心明眼亮，敌我分明，立场坚定，斗志昂扬。不管敌人耍什么阴谋诡计，都不会上当。不管在斗争中遇到什么障碍，都能排除万难，争取胜利。
    新华社武汉八日电　中共湖北省委不久前召开武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命积极分子代表会，号召全省工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子和一切革命的人们，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入开展无产阶级文化大革命运动，放手发动群众，采取大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，彻底揭发和打倒一切牛鬼蛇神。
    出席这次大会的，有武汉地区大中学校的师生职工代表、大中型企业职工代表和机关团体的代表，共六千五百多人。
    大会由中共湖北省委书记处书记许道琦主持。省委书记处书记王树成代表省委在大会上作了题为《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入开展无产阶级文化大革命运动》的动员报告。
    王树成同志在报告中说，目前，湖北省和全国各地一样，一个横扫一切反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神的革命风暴，已经席卷全省，呈现一片大好的社会主义革命形势。广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子革命热情高涨，不仅积极参加全国性的战斗，全省性的战斗，而且正在广泛地动员起来，揭发批判本地、本单位的一切牛鬼蛇神。群众的革命热情是这样高涨，革命的主动精神是这样强烈，其势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常。
    王树成同志指出，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，各级党委领导必须有自我革命的决心，必须有同一切剥削阶级思想彻底决裂的决心，用毛泽东思想来检查自己的思想和工作，热情地欢迎群众的批评，有错必改。只有这样，才能站在运动前面，领导群众胜利地开展斗争。对待革命的群众运动采取什么态度，是支持还是反对，这是区别革命和反革命的一个重要标志。如果有的人在运动中顽固不化，压制民主，压制批评，甚至打击报复，各级党委一定要及时地、坚决地、严肃地进行处理，给革命的群众撑腰。
    王树成同志说，毛主席的著作，是我们各项工作的最高指示。我们一定要用毛泽东思想来指导无产阶级文化大革命运动的开展。
    在革命风暴中，各级党委，各个工作组，共产党员、共青团员和革命的积极分子，都应当把搞好无产阶级文化大革命作为自己的光荣的任务。
    为了搞好这场大革命，王树成同志强调要做好以下几点：
    第一，运动当中，自始至终都要活学活用毛主席著作。
    要带着阶级感情学，带着问题学，边学边用。在斗争中，不管遇到什么难解决的问题，都要向毛主席著作去请教。用毛泽东思想去观察一切、分析一切，用毛泽东思想去发动群众，改造旧世界，我们将无往而不胜。
    我们要在斗争中前进，就要在斗争中上毛主席著作的课。无产阶级文化大革命运动，必须以毛泽东思想为指南才能取得胜利。我们必须在这场伟大的革命斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，把斗争和学习紧密地结合起来，斗争是最好的学习，学习是为了斗争。
    第二，放手发动群众，彻底打倒一切牛鬼蛇神。
    各级党组织必须亲临前线，积极领导运动。要满腔热情地支持革命的群众运动，要带头揭发批判，要敢于引火烧身。放手发动群众还是不放手发动群众，这是革命还是不革命，真革命还是假革命的问题。
    要发动群众采取大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，把问题充分揭发出来，揭深揭透，不准压制批评。共产党员、共青团员要站在革命斗争的前列。
    这一次无产阶级文化大革命斗争的矛头，是针对着一小撮钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物，是针对着一小撮反党反社会主义反革命的资产阶级知识分子。因此，对知识分子怎样估计，采取什么政策，是个很重要的问题。大家要认真学习毛主席在一九五七年三月《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》。要精读，发动群众读，并展开认真的讨论。什么是知识分子当中的左派、中间派、右派？毛主席讲的十分明确。左派是少数，中间派占大多数，右派即坚决反党反社会主义的是极少数。左派，包括共产党员和党外同情分子，他们比较熟悉马克思主义，站稳了无产阶级立场。这些人是少数，但他们是运动的核心力量。在运动中要依靠左派，提高左派，壮大左派，要提高他们的威信，把他们提拔到领导岗位上来。中间派人数最多，他们没有站稳脚跟，一遇风浪就左右摇摆。对他们要从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争使矛盾得到解决，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结。斗争锋芒不要对着他们。对于从旧社会过来的广大知识分子，只要他们不反党不反社会主义，也要采取团结、教育、改造的方针，对他们的缺点错误，要采取批评与自我批评的方法来解决。要在运动中，教育改造这些人。革命高潮到来，左派力量形成，加上我们正确地执行政策，中间派就可以向左派靠拢。这样，就能形成压倒优势，最大限度地把右派孤立起来。右派就是反党反社会主义的人；就是那种不喜欢我们这个无产阶级专政的国家，留恋旧社会，一遇机会，就兴风作浪，想推翻共产党，恢复旧中国的人。这种人是极少数。他们人数虽少，但他们的能量大于他们的数量。我们要坚决把这种人斗倒、斗臭。　
    第三，代表会（比如师生职工代表会、职工代表会等）是组织左派力量，团结多数群众的一个好形式。要放手发动群众，充分发扬民主，选好代表。代表的作用，就是革命积极分子在群众中的骨干作用，桥梁作用，带头作用。省委号召全体代表都要做学习毛主席著作的模范，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好学生、好战士、好宣传员。
    第四，政策和策略是党的生命。
    我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。我们的工作犯不犯错误，其界限也在这里。”
    我们要牢记毛主席的教导，放手发动群众，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；区别两类矛盾，弄清左、中、右，以及对待他们的方针政策。这就是各级党组织、工作组、代表会应该掌握好的头等大事。要相信群众，要把政策交给他们。毛主席的话，党的政策，是最容易为广大群众所接受的。
    对反党反社会主义分子要斗倒、斗臭。要采取摆事实、讲道理的方法，把他们的反动言行、丑恶面貌彻底揭穿，把他们的谬论彻底驳倒，使他们彻底孤立，确实臭了，再没有人听他那一套了。这才算真正把他们斗倒了。
    第五，加强党的领导。
    开展无产阶级文化大革命，必须放手发动群众，大搞群众运动，同时，也必须加强党的领导。我们必须懂得：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”同样，无产阶级文化大革命，也只有在党的坚强领导之下才能取得胜利。
    第六，今年是我国第三个五年计划的头一年，无产阶级文化大革命的暴风雨，必将推动各项工作的发展。我们工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子，要积极参加无产阶级文化大革命运动，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，进一步提高觉悟，鼓足干劲，克服困难，夺取今年的农业大丰收，力争提前完成今年的生产和建设计划。
    第七，全省的无产阶级文化大革命运动，采取有点有面，点面结合的办法，普遍开展。整个运动，最后要落脚到大学毛主席著作，改造世界观，实现人的思想革命化上来。
    王树成同志最后说，在毛主席和党中央的英明领导下，大大小小的“三家村”都将被彻底摧毁，一切牛鬼蛇神都将被彻底打倒。在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，无产阶级知识分子的队伍正在日益壮大，资产阶级知识分子统治文化、思想领域的现象将要一去不复返了。
    到会的代表们革命激情澎湃、斗志昂扬，一致拥护省委的战斗号召，表示决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步壮大无产阶级革命派的力量，团结百分之九十五以上的群众，把无产阶级文化大革命运动更加深入地开展起来，彻底打倒一切反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神，不获全胜，决不收兵。
