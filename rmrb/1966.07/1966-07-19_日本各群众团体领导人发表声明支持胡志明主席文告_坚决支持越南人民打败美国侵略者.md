Japanese leaders from various sectors issued statements on July 18, expressing full support for the proclamation by Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, praising the Vietnamese people's resolute determination to defeat American imperialist aggression.

The representative of the Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, Hatanaka Masaharu, said, "We have always respected the Vietnamese people who have overcome various difficulties and are waging a truly heroic struggle. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's proclamation has given an even deeper impression to the peoples of the world who are facing off against American imperialism."

The chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, Hirano Yoshitaro, said, "We fully support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's proclamation and will intensify our struggle against American imperialism's aggression in Vietnam."

Hirano said, "The only way to resolve the Vietnam issue is for the United States to accept the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and to withdraw all U.S. troops and their puppet forces."

The secretary-general of the Japan-Vietnam Friendship Association, Nomura Katsusaburo, said, "We fully support the Vietnamese people's resolute determination to defeat the American aggressors." He pointed out that the basis for this determination is their own resolve to fight a protracted war and the support and aid from the international community.

The secretary-general of the Japan Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, Itabe Shozo, issued a statement saying, "We firmly support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's proclamation." The statement said, "We believe that the Vietnamese people's war against the United States is a just war and will undoubtedly achieve final victory."

The deputy chairman of the All-Japan Metal and Machinery Workers' Union, Takano Minoru, issued a statement saying, "Chairman Ho Chi Minh's proclamation is a blow to the head of American imperialism and its lackeys."

He said, "The Japanese people should make greater efforts to strengthen solidarity with the Vietnamese people and the anti-imperialist forces of the world, and drive American imperialism out of the entire Asian continent."
