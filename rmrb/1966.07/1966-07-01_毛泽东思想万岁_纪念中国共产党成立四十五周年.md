Today, amidst the high tide of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the magnificent situation of the world's revolutionary struggles, we commemorate the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.

Our Party is a great, glorious, and correct Party.

Our Party is the Party founded and nurtured by Comrade Mao Zedong, a Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a Party that combines theory with practice, closely ties with the masses, and has a serious spirit of self-criticism, a Party that has undergone the most intense, arduous, prolonged, and complex struggles in revolutionary history.

The 45-year history of our Party is a history of Comrade Mao Zedong combining the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practices of the Chinese and world revolutions. The great victories our Party has achieved over the past 45 years are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought.

Mao Zedong Thought has developed in the practice of our people's democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction; it has developed in the struggle of our Party and Marxist-Leninists of various countries against imperialism and modern revisionism; it has developed in summing up the new experiences of the oppressed peoples and nations in their struggle against imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries; it has developed in summing up the new experiences of the international proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship since the great October Socialist Revolution; it has developed in drawing the serious and painful lessons from the Khrushchev group's usurpation of the Party, the army, and the government, and the restoration of the capitalist road in the Soviet Union.

Like Comrade Mao Zedong, who has experienced such a long, complex, intense, and multifaceted struggle, Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are rare in history. Because Comrade Mao Zedong is good at using the dialectical and historical materialism of Marxism-Leninism to summarize the new experiences of various revolutionary struggles, Mao Zedong Thought is the sole correct guide for each stage of our revolution, a powerful revolutionary ideological weapon for the oppressed peoples and nations to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries.

Mao Zedong Thought is the genius, creative, and comprehensive inheritance and development of Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. It is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist.

Lenin said: "Marxism, in the course of its development, has had to fight at every step." Mao Zedong Thought has developed in the struggle against powerful enemies at home and abroad and in the struggle against various opportunist thoughts within the Party.

Throughout the long period since its founding, our Party has been guided by the red line of Marxism-Leninism represented by Mao Zedong Thought. During the entire period of the democratic revolution, the correct line of the Party, represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, engaged in serious struggles against two right-opportunist lines and three "left"-opportunist lines. The Zunyi Conference in January 1935 established Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership over the entire Party. Through the rectification movement that began in 1942 and the Seventh National Congress of the Party in 1945, Mao Zedong Thought was established as the guiding ideology of the entire Party and the guiding principle for all Party work.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out at the Seventh National Congress of the Party: "Comrade Mao Zedong is a genius creator of Marxism." The emergence and development of Mao Zedong Thought "is the greatest achievement and greatest glory of our Party and the Chinese people in their long struggle. It will benefit our nation for generations to come. It will also make a significant and beneficial contribution to the liberation struggles of the peoples of all countries, especially the liberation struggles of the peoples of the East."

The founding of the People's Republic of China marked the beginning of a new era of socialist revolution and proletarian dictatorship in our country. The socialist revolution is a thorough revolution to eliminate the exploiting classes and private ownership, a revolution far deeper and more extensive than the democratic revolution. In socialist society, after the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production has been completed, class and class contradictions still exist, although the forms of class struggle have changed, class struggle has not ended. In the period of proletarian dictatorship, there is extremely complex and sharp class struggle. The class enemies at home and abroad are extremely hostile to our socialist cause. At home, the overthrown and gradually disappearing exploiting classes are struggling desperately and resisting fiercely. Although they are still alive, their hearts are not dead, and they collude with the newly emerged bourgeois elements, constantly attempting to achieve counter-revolutionary restoration. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are always trying every means to conspire, attack, sabotage, disintegrate, and overthrow our socialist system. This fierce class struggle at home and abroad inevitably reflects within our Party.

In the 16 years since the founding of the country, the Party Central Committee led by Comrade Mao Zedong has engaged in three major struggles against anti-Party revisionist cliques.

The first major struggle was against the anti-Party alliance of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi.

This struggle took place at a critical moment in 1953 when our country's large-scale socialist revolution began. At this time, the Party proposed the general line of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. Gao Gang and Rao Shushi, these bourgeois agents who had infiltrated the Party, these careerists and conspirators, could no longer endure the situation in which domestic class relations were undergoing drastic changes and class struggle was extremely tense. They engaged in extensive conspiratorial activities, attempting to seize the highest power of the Party and the state to achieve bourgeois counter-revolutionary restoration. The Party Central Committee led by Comrade Mao Zedong resolutely fought against these counter-revolutionaries. At the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in 1954 and the Party Representative Conference in 1955, this anti-Party alliance was thoroughly exposed and smashed.

Due to the victory of this struggle, the entire Party united more closely under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and around the Party Central Committee led by Comrade Mao Zedong, ensuring the great victory of the socialist transformation.

The second major struggle was against another small group of right-opportunist, revisionist anti-Party clique.

In 1958, the Party Central Committee led by Comrade Mao Zedong proposed the general line of building socialism with great, daring, pioneering, and experimental spirit. Under the inspiration of this general line, the people of the entire country were full of vigor and enthusiasm, launching a great new high tide of socialist revolution and socialist construction. This was a new leap forward. During this leap forward, the people's communes emerged in the countryside nationwide. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries at home and abroad were extremely terrified and hostile to our Party's general line of building socialism and to our people's great leap forward and the establishment of people's communes under the guidance of the Party's general line. They joined forces to launch a frenzied attack on us. At the Lushan Conference in 1959, a small group of bourgeois careerists and conspirators who had infiltrated the Party, with the support of the Khrushchev revisionist clique, launched a ferocious attack on the Party Central Committee led by Comrade Mao Zedong. They put forward a thoroughly revisionist program, attempting to replace the Party's general line of socialist construction and to drag our country back to the capitalist road.

Our Party, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee, rose up in unison to give this anti-Party clique a resolute rebuff, thoroughly smashing their conspiracy, defending the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee led by Comrade Mao Zedong, defending the unity of the Party, and defending the Party's general line of socialist construction. This was followed by one victory after another on various fronts by the Chinese people. People saw that the seeds sown by the great leap forward of 1958 and 1959 had already borne abundant fruits.

The victory of the struggle against the right-opportunist anti-Party clique in 1959 is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. This victory has great historical significance for our country's advancement on the socialist road.

The third major struggle was against the recently exposed anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought counter-revolutionary clique.

These anti-Party elements are bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and the cultural circles, occupying important positions. Their activities are more concealed and cunning than the previous two smashed anti-Party cliques. They have long been waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. They hang up the false sign of supporting the Party and socialism, but engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist counter-revolutionary activities.

As our country's socialist revolution deepens and the socialist education movement develops, the issue of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has become prominent. This counter-revolutionary clique, standing on the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie, vigorously resists and opposes the line of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, resists and opposes the guiding principles on the class and class struggle issues in socialist society proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong at the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and opposes carrying the socialist revolution through to the end. In the important positions they control in the news, education, literary, academic, publishing, and other cultural circles, they wage class struggle of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, spread a large amount of bourgeois and revisionist poison, and launch a ferocious attack on Mao Zedong Thought, the Party Central Committee led by Comrade Mao Zedong, and the socialist system. They spare no effort to shelter the bourgeois rightists, suppress the revolutionary actions of the proletariat, suppress the revolutionary movements of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and resist and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Their hands reach far, aiming to seize Party power, military power, and state power. Their goal is to usurp the Party, the army, and the government, and to achieve the restoration of capitalism. Once the time is ripe, they will stage a Khrushchev-style counter-revolutionary coup.

They seize the pen to prepare public opinion for their capitalist restoration and counter-revolutionary coup.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly exposing and smashing this counter-revolutionary clique is a new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a major event to ensure the continued development of our country's socialist revolution, to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, to prevent the revisionists from usurping the leadership, to prevent the restoration of capitalism, to prevent counter-revolutionary coups, and to prevent counter-revolutionary subversion. It is a major event related to the fate of the people of the entire country. In a broad sense, it is also a major event related to the fate of the people of the world.

The three major struggles within our Party over the past 16 years are the struggles between Mao Zedong Thought and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, between the Marxist-Leninist line and the revisionist line, and between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism.

Chairman Mao said, "The existence of different ideas and the struggle between them within the Party is inevitable. This is a reflection within the Party of the class contradictions and the contradictions between the old and the new in society. If there are no contradictions and struggles to resolve them within the Party, the Party's life would come to an end." Chairman Mao also pointed out, "Class struggle is an objective existence, independent of the will of man. That is to say, it is inevitable. Man's will cannot avoid it, but can only guide it and achieve victory."

Every time our Party undergoes a major struggle, it clears out a small group of class aliens who have infiltrated the Party. This is a completely normal and lawful phenomenon. After each such struggle, our Party becomes more united, more consolidated, and more powerful in combat. The imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries at home and abroad dream of finding a straw to grasp from this, but it is all in vain.

The three major struggles within our Party over the past 16 years show: the ultimate goal of all the evil activities of the anti-Party cliques is to stage a counter-revolutionary coup, to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. If their evil conspiracies are not exposed, they will definitely harm the people.

If their conspiracies succeed, the proletarian state we have fought and sacrificed for decades will be in vain. The people of our country will once again be oppressed and exploited, living like cattle and horses. Imperialism will return, and Khrushchev revisionism will ride roughshod over us. Our country will once again become a colony and a semi-colony.

We Communist Party members, revolutionary proletarians, and all those who support the socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat must not take such matters lightly and must treat them seriously.

Because our Party is a Party that has undergone decades of revolution under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, a Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a Party that is closely tied with the masses and has rich revolutionary experience, we can completely expose and smash these anti-Party cliques and prevent their conspiracies from succeeding. These anti-Party elements are nothing special. Once their conspiracies are exposed, they immediately fall into the encirclement of the broad masses of the people and reveal their true colors as paper tigers.

Great Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest obstacle to the conspiracies of all anti-Party cliques to stage counter-revolutionary coups. Therefore, they always direct their attacks at Mao Zedong Thought. They, like the imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists, become infuriated, curse, jump up, and have hysterical fits at the mention of Mao Zedong Thought. Whoever supports Mao Zedong Thought and advocates learning Mao Zedong Thought, they oppose and attack, slander and defame, using every means and doing every evil deed. They are particularly afraid of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasping Mao Zedong Thought. They use "simplification," "vulgarization," and "pragmatism" as pretexts to oppose the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They issue bans and stick seals, preventing Mao Zedong Thought from reaching the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, the more they prohibit, seal, and oppose, the more the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers love Chairman Mao's works and study them with great enthusiasm.

The 45-year history of our Party proves that Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our Party, the lifeline of our Party. Anti-Party careerists who conspire to usurp the Party, the army, and the government must definitely denigrate, distort, attack, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought. To ensure that our Party never changes its nature and that our country never changes its color, we must forever take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of our Party and the common ideological foundation for the unity and revolution of the entire Party. It is like this now, it will be like this in a hundred years, it will be like this in a thousand years, and it will forever be like this. The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the measure of who is a true revolutionary, who is a false revolutionary and counter-revolutionary, who is a Marxist-Leninist, and who is a revisionist. Whether now or in the future, whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought is the enemy of the revolution, the enemy of the people, and must be jointly condemned by the entire Party and the entire country.

As early as 21 years ago, Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out to the entire Party: "The important task now is to mobilize the entire Party to study Mao Zedong Thought, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and arm our Party members and revolutionary people with Mao Zedong Thought, making Mao Zedong Thought an actual and irresistible force."

Comrade Zhou Enlai said: "Arming our cadres and laboring people with Mao Zedong Thought is an extremely important condition for carrying the socialist revolution in our country to the end and smoothly advancing the cause of socialist construction in our country. It is also the fundamental method to overcome and prevent bourgeois ideology, revisionism, and dogmatism."

Comrade Lin Biao proposed: "Our country is a great socialist country under the dictatorship of the proletariat with a population of 700 million. It needs a unified ideology, a revolutionary ideology, a correct ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought. We must, through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, instill Chairman Mao's thoughts into the workers and peasants, so as to change the spiritual outlook of the laboring people and transform spiritual power into a great material force."

Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "The greatest advantage of our Party is that it has the guiding ideology represented by Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought has been tested by history. The Chinese revolution was not led to victory by any other ideology, but by Mao Zedong Thought. After the revolution's victory, it was also under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought that our socialist revolution and socialist construction achieved such great successes and continued to advance victoriously."

The People's Liberation Army is a tool of proletarian dictatorship, loyal to the Party and the people, personally founded by Comrade Mao Zedong. The People's Liberation Army responds to the call of the Central Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao to "read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao," launching the movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. This is a great innovation and has achieved immeasurable and tremendous results.

The movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country is flourishing. This is an unprecedented magnificent ideological revolution in human history. This is the unprecedented popularization of Marxism-Leninism. A country with a quarter of the world's population is becoming a great school for studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. With several hundred million people armed with Mao Zedong Thought and millions of successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we can carry the socialist revolution in our country to the end, gradually transition our country from socialism to communism, and make greater contributions to the world revolution.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the broad revolutionary cadres, and the broad revolutionary intellectuals across the country must closely unite around the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, resolutely follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee: never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

    毛泽东思想万岁
    ——纪念中国共产党成立四十五周年
    今天，在我国无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，在世界人民革命斗争波澜壮阔的大好形势下，我们来纪念中国共产党成立四十五周年。
    我们的党，是伟大的、光荣的、正确的党。
    我们的党，是毛泽东同志亲手缔造和培育的党，是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的党，是理论同实际相结合的、和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的、有认真的自我批评精神的无产阶级革命党，是经历了革命历史上最激烈、最艰苦、最长期、最复杂的斗争的无产阶级革命党。
    我们党的四十五年的历史，是毛泽东同志把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命和世界革命的具体实践密切结合起来的历史。我们党四十五年来所取得的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    毛泽东思想是在我国人民民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的实践中，发展起来的；是在我党和各国马克思列宁主义者同帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中，发展起来的；是在总结被压迫人民和被压迫民族反对帝国主义和各国反动派斗争的新经验中，发展起来的；是在总结伟大的十月社会主义革命以来国际无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的新经验中，发展起来的；是在吸取苏联赫鲁晓夫集团篡党、篡军、篡政，而把苏联由社会主义制度引向资本主义复辟道路的严重的、痛苦的教训中，发展起来的。
    象毛泽东同志经历那样长期、那样复杂、那样激烈、那样多方面的斗争的革命领袖，同马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林一样，在历史上是罕见的。正因为毛泽东同志善于随时运用马克思列宁主义的辩证唯物论和历史唯物论，来总结各种革命斗争的新经验，所以，毛泽东思想是我国革命各个阶段上唯一正确的指针，是被压迫人民和被压迫民族反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和反对一切反动派的强大的革命思想武器。
    毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代，天才地、创造性地、全面地继承和发展了的马克思列宁主义，是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。
    列宁说：马克思主义“在其生命的途程中每走一步都得经过战斗”。毛泽东思想是在同国内外各种强大敌人的斗争中发展起来的，也是在同党内各种机会主义思想的斗争中发展起来的。
    我们党从成立以来的长时期中，贯串着以毛泽东思想为指针的一条马克思列宁主义红线。在整个民主革命时期，以毛泽东同志为代表的党的正确路线，曾经先后同两次右倾机会主义路线和三次“左”倾机会主义路线进行了严重的斗争。一九三五年一月的遵义会议，确立了毛泽东同志在全党的领导地位。经过一九四二年开始的全党的整风运动，到一九四五年党的第七次全国代表大会，确定了以毛泽东思想作为我们全党的指导思想，作为党的一切工作的指针。
    刘少奇同志在党的第七次全国代表大会上指出：毛泽东同志“是天才的创造的马克思主义者”。毛泽东思想的产生和发展，“这是我们党和我国人民在长期奋斗中最大的收获与最大的光荣，它将造福于我国民族至遥远的后代。”“并将对各国人民的解放事业，特别是东方各民族的解放事业，作重大的有益的贡献。”
    中华人民共和国的成立，标志着我国进入了社会主义革命和无产阶级专政的新时代。社会主义革命是彻底消灭剥削阶级和私有制的革命，是比民主革命深刻得无可比拟、广泛得无可比拟的革命。在社会主义社会里，在完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造以后，阶级和阶级矛盾仍然存在，虽然阶级斗争的形式发生了变化，但是阶级斗争并没有结束。在无产阶级专政时期，存在着极其复杂、极其尖锐的阶级斗争。国内外的阶级敌人极端仇视我们的社会主义事业。在国内，被打倒的和正在逐步被消灭的剥削阶级拚命挣扎，拚命反抗。他们人还在，心不死，并且同那些新产生的资产阶级分子互相勾结，时刻企图实现反革命复辟。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派总是千方百计地阴谋进攻、破坏、瓦解和颠覆我们的社会主义制度。这种激烈的国内外的阶级斗争，不可避免地要反映到我们党内来。
    建国十六年来，以毛泽东同志为首的党中央马克思列宁主义的领导，同反党修正主义集团，进行了三次大的斗争。
    第一次大的斗争，是同高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的斗争。
    这场斗争，发生在一九五三年我国大规模社会主义革命开始的紧要关头。这时，党提出了社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的总路线。高岗、饶漱石这些混进党内的资产阶级代理人，这些野心家、阴谋家，在国内阶级关系剧烈变化、阶级斗争十分紧张的形势下，再也耐不住了。他们大肆进行阴谋活动，妄图夺取党和国家的最高权力，实现资产阶级的反革命复辟。以毛泽东同志为首的党中央，同这些反革命分子进行了坚决的斗争。在一九五四年党的七届四中全会和一九五五年党的代表会议上，彻底揭露和粉碎了这个反党联盟。
    由于这个斗争的胜利，全党更加紧密地团结在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，团结在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的周围，保证了社会主义改造的伟大胜利。
    第二次大的斗争，是同另一小撮右倾机会主义即修正主义反党集团的斗争。
    一九五八年，以毛泽东同志为首的党中央提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。在这个总路线的鼓舞下，全国人民意气风发，掀起了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大新高潮。这是一个新的大跃进。在这个大跃进的过程中，出现了全国农村的人民公社化。帝国主义、现代修正主义和国内外反动派，对我党的建设社会主义总路线，对我国人民在党的总路线指导下的大跃进和人民公社化，极端恐慌，极端仇视，联合起来对我们进行疯狂的攻击。在一九五九年党的庐山会议上，一小撮混进党内的资产阶级野心家、阴谋家，在赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的支持下，向以毛泽东同志为首的党中央，发动了猖狂的进攻。他们抛出了一个彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领，企图用来代替党的社会主义建设总路线，妄想把我国拉回到资本主义道路上去。
    我们的党，在毛泽东同志和党中央的领导下，一致奋起，给这个反党集团以坚决回击，彻底粉碎了他们的阴谋，保卫了以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的正确领导，保卫了党的团结，保卫了党的社会主义建设总路线。随之而来的，是我国人民在各个战线上取得了一个又一个的胜利。人们看见，一九五八年和一九五九年大跃进所播下的种籽，已经结下丰硕的果实。
    一九五九年反对右倾机会主义反党集团这场斗争的胜利，是毛泽东思想的又一次伟大的胜利。这个胜利，对于我国在社会主义道路上前进，具有重大的历史意义。
    第三次大的斗争，是同最近揭发出来的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命集团的斗争。
    这一些反党分子是混进党里、政府里、军队里和文化界里，窃踞重要职务的资产阶级代表人物，他们的活动，比前两次被粉碎的反党集团更隐蔽、更狡猾。他们长期地打着“红旗”反红旗，披着马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的外衣，反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。他们挂着拥护党拥护社会主义的假招牌，干的是反党反社会主义的反革命勾当。
    随着我国社会主义革命的逐步深入，随着社会主义教育运动的逐步发展，无产阶级文化大革命的问题就突出起来了。这个反革命集团，站在资产阶级的反动立场上，竭力抵制和反对党中央和毛泽东同志提出的社会主义文化大革命的路线，抵制和反对毛泽东同志在党的八届十中全会上提出的社会主义社会阶级和阶级斗争问题的指导方针，反对把社会主义革命进行到底。在他们所控制的新闻界、教育界、文艺界、学术界、出版界以及其他文化界的一些重要阵地上，他们大搞资产阶级对无产阶级的阶级斗争，大量散布资产阶级、修正主义毒素，向毛泽东思想、向以毛泽东同志为首的党中央、向社会主义制度，发动了猖狂的进攻。他们千方百计地包庇资产阶级右派，打击无产阶级革命派，压制广大工农兵群众的革命运动，抗拒和破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他们的手伸得很长，要抓党权、要抓军权、要抓政权。他们的目的，就是要篡党、篡军、篡政，实现资本主义复辟。一旦时机成熟，他们就要演出赫鲁晓夫式的反革命政变。
    他们抓笔杆子，就是要为他们的资本主义复辟和反革命政变作舆论准备。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，彻底揭露和粉碎这个反革命集团，是毛泽东思想的新的伟大的胜利。这是保证我国社会主义革命继续发展的大事，是巩固无产阶级专政的大事，是防止修正主义篡夺领导权、防止资本主义复辟的大事，是防止反革命政变、防止反革命颠覆的大事，是关系全国人民命运的大事。从广义上说，也是关系世界人民命运的大事。
    十六年来我们党内发生的三次大斗争，是毛泽东思想同反毛泽东思想的斗争，是马克思列宁主义路线同修正主义路线的斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。
    毛主席说，“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”毛主席还指出，“阶级斗争是客观存在，不依人的意志为转移的。就是说，不可避免的。人的意志想要避免，也不可能。只能因势利导，夺取胜利。”
    我们党每经历一次大斗争，清除一小撮混进党内的阶级异己分子，这是完全正常的、合乎规律的现象。每经过这样一场斗争，我们的党就更加团结了，更加巩固了，战斗力就更加坚强了。帝国主义、现代修正主义和国内外反动派，梦想从这里面捞取一根稻草，完全是枉费心机。
    十六年来我们党内三次大斗争说明：那些反党集团的一切罪恶活动的目的，都是为了搞反革命政变，为了变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。如果不把他们的罪恶阴谋揭发出来，他们肯定是要对人民下毒手的。
    如果他们的阴谋得逞，我们几十年流血牺牲打出来的无产阶级江山，人民的江山，就会废于一旦。我国人民就要重新受压迫、受剥削，过牛马的生活。帝国主义就会卷土重来，赫鲁晓夫修正主义也会骑到我们头上，我国就会重新沦为殖民地、半殖民地。
    我们共产党员，革命的无产阶级，一切拥护社会主义制度和无产阶级专政的人们，对于这样的事情，决不能等闲视之，一定要严正对待。
    由于我们的党是毛泽东同志领导下几十年革命的党，是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的党，是同人民群众血肉相联的、有丰富革命经验的党，我们完全能够识破和揭露这些反党集团，使他们的阴谋不能够得逞。这些反党分子并没有什么了不起，他们的阴谋一旦被戳穿，就立即陷入广大人民群众的包围之中，就显出了纸老虎的原形。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，是一切反党集团阴谋搞反革命政变的最大障碍。因此，他们总是把攻击的矛头指向毛泽东思想。他们和帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者一样，一提到毛泽东思想就反感，就骂街，就跳起来，就歇斯底里大发作。谁拥护毛泽东思想，提倡学习毛泽东思想，他们就反对谁、攻击谁，造谣、诬蔑，什么手段都使得出来，什么坏事都干得出来。他们特别害怕广大工农兵直接掌握毛泽东思想。他们以“简单化”、
  “庸俗化”、“实用主义”为罪名，来反对广大工农兵活学活用毛主席著作。他们下禁令、贴封条，就是不让毛泽东思想同广大工农兵群众见面。但是，他们越是禁止，越是封锁，越是反对，广大工农兵越是热爱毛主席著作，越是如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。
    我们党四十五年的历史经验证明，毛泽东思想是我们党的灵魂，是我们党的命根子。反党野心家阴谋篡党、篡军、篡政，就一定要贬低、歪曲、攻击和反对毛泽东思想。为了使我们的党永不变质，使我们的国家永不变色，我们就要永远把毛泽东思想作为我们党的指导思想，作为全党团结和革命的共同思想基础。现在是这样，一百年是这样，一千年也是这样，永远是这样。对待毛泽东思想的态度，是衡量谁是真革命，谁是假革命、反革命，谁是马克思列宁主义，谁是修正主义的尺度。不论是现在还是将来，谁要反对毛泽东思想，就是革命的死敌，就是人民的死敌，就要全党共诛之，全国共讨之。
    早在二十一年前，刘少奇同志就向全党指出：“现在的重要任务，就是动员全党来学习毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想来武装我们的党员和革命的人民，使毛泽东思想变为实际的不可抗御的力量。”
    周恩来同志说：“用毛泽东思想把我们的干部和劳动人民武装起来，是把我国社会主义革命进行到底，顺利推进我国社会主义建设事业的极其重要的条件，也是克服和防止资产阶级思想、修正主义和教条主义的根本方法。”
    林彪同志提出：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”
    邓小平同志指出：“我们党的最大的优点，就是有以毛泽东思想为代表的指导思想。毛泽东思想是经过了历史的考验的。中国的革命不是由别的思想引导到胜利的，而是由毛泽东思想引导到胜利的。革命胜利以后，也正是在毛泽东思想的指导下，我们的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，才获得了这样伟大的成就，并且继续胜利地前进着。”
    中国人民解放军是毛泽东同志亲手缔造的忠实于党、忠实于人民的无产阶级专政的工具。人民解放军响应中央军委和林彪同志提出的“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”的号召，开展了活学活用毛主席著作的运动。这是一个伟大的创举，已经收到了不可估量的巨大的成效。
    全国亿万工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作的运动正在蓬勃发展，这是人类历史上空前宏伟的思想革命运动。这是马克思列宁主义的空前普遍化。占世界人口四分之一的大国，正在变成学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的大学校。有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的几亿人民，有了千百万用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命事业的接班人，我们才能够把我国的社会主义革命进行到底，才能够使我国由社会主义逐步地过渡到共产主义，才能够使我国对世界革命作出更大的贡献。
    全国广大工农兵群众，广大革命干部和广大革命知识分子，要紧紧地团结在党中央和毛泽东同志的周围，坚决遵照党中央的指示：念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
