During our approximately 2,000-kilometer journey in South Vietnam, we not only witnessed the patriotism, revolutionary heroism, and internationalism of the South Vietnamese military and people, as well as their glorious victories in the anti-American national salvation struggle, but we also personally felt the deep affection and trust that the South Vietnamese military and people, standing on the frontline of the anti-American struggle, have for Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people.

Whether in the rugged mountains of the Truong Son Range, in the dense forests along the Mekong River, or in the outposts of the guerrilla forces around Da Nang, or on the ferry across the Saigon River, we were deeply moved by the fighting friendship of the South Vietnamese military and people. In the central highlands and the D liberation zone, where the American aggressors were severely defeated, liberation army soldiers emerged from the dense forests, running swiftly, and greeted us like old comrades-in-arms. They enthusiastically shook our hands and embraced us, repeatedly shouting excitedly, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live China!"

In a village on the outskirts of Saigon, amidst the sound of gunfire, an elderly woman in her late seventies, tears streaming down her face, tightly grasped our hands and said, "Dear friends, you have come here. Thank you, Chairman Mao! Thank you, Chinese people. Together with the Chinese people, the people of South Vietnam will surely defeat the American aggressors."

"We Stand Together Forever"

The Truong Son Range, with its overlapping peaks. In the vast forest, various evergreen trees of the subtropical region compete to grow, reaching for the sky, making it impossible to see the treetops. All that can be seen is a dense canopy of branches and broad-leaved epiphytes hanging from the tree trunks. We traveled through this primitive forest for many days, and one evening, we finally arrived at the forward command post of a certain unit of the South Vietnamese liberation forces.

We were warmly welcomed by the South Vietnamese comrades at the forward command post. After they arranged for us to rest in a small hut made of bamboo, it was already midnight. Suddenly, a few people rushed into the room. Leading them was a tall, handsome man wearing a faded black military uniform. As soon as he entered, without saying a word, he embraced us one by one as if we were old comrades-in-arms who had not seen each other for many years. The deputy commander of the forward command post followed him in and introduced him, saying, "This is our old comrade-in-arms, Comrade Quyet. He heard that Chinese comrades had arrived and rushed here through the night, covering thirty miles, just to see you."

Comrade Quyet excitedly said to us, "This is the first time I have seen Chinese comrades, but we are not new friends; we are old comrades-in-arms who have fought side by side."

Through the introductions of the South Vietnamese comrades, we learned that Comrade Quyet had been engaged in revolutionary struggle in the South for more than twenty years and had previously served as a leader in the province of Kontum. After the signing of the Geneva Accords, during the period of white terror and mass slaughter by the American puppet regime, he moved into the mountains, grew his hair long, learned the language and customs of the ethnic minorities, and continued the revolutionary struggle. At that time, he and other comrades wandered in the primitive forests, fighting the enemy year after year. With no salt to eat, they ate grass roots and charcoal; with no food to eat, they ate wild vegetables. For the liberation of the country and the people, he, like thousands and thousands of South Vietnamese comrades, endured countless hardships and fought bravely and unyieldingly.

Comrade Quyet sat cross-legged next to us, excitedly talking about the South Vietnamese people's brave struggle against the enemy in that extremely difficult period. He said in a passionate tone, "During that dark time, we thought of Comrade Ho Chi Minh and the people of the North, and we also thought of Chairman Mao and the Chinese people. Chairman Mao and the Chinese people gave us confidence and courage. The people of the South are not afraid and cannot be crushed. Comrades who persisted in the revolutionary struggle opened up small revolutionary base areas under extremely difficult conditions, led the people to take up crude weapons to fight, and raised the red flag of revolution in the deep mountains and forests."

Comrade Quyet extended his hand, pressing it firmly on ours. We felt a surge of fighting friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, nurtured in the midst of hard struggle, surging in our hearts. Comrade Quyet said, "We thank Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese people for their support in our most difficult times. We will always stand together. Wherever you go in South Vietnam, you will see the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples. The South Vietnamese military and people regard Comrade Mao Zedong as the greatest revolutionary leader and regard the Chinese people as their true comrades-in-arms and brothers."

Just as Comrade Quyet said, during our visit to South Vietnam, we felt the strongest and most sincere fighting friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples everywhere. We also cannot forget that last June, when we visited the province of Binh Dinh, the provincial leader solemnly presented us with a Chinese national flag to take to Beijing to offer to Chairman Mao. This flag was sewn by an elderly woman from the village of Phu My in Binh Dinh sixteen years ago. It was during the time when the Vietnamese people were fiercely fighting against the French colonialists. To celebrate the Chinese National Day, this elderly woman sewed a Chinese five-star red flag and a Vietnamese yellow-star red flag overnight and hung them at a meeting celebrating the victory of the Chinese people. After the signing of the Geneva Accords, during the period of bloody massacres by the American puppet regime, the elderly woman, in a moonless night, folded the two solemn flags and placed them in a ceramic jar, burying them to preserve them. Ten years later, the South Vietnamese liberation army liberated the village of Phu My from the clutches of the American puppet regime. The elderly woman, tears in her eyes, dug up the ceramic jar from the ground and took out the two flags that had been preserved for ten years. Later, the elderly woman found a way to send them to the provincial headquarters and requested that the Vietnamese flag be taken to Hanoi to offer to Comrade Ho Chi Minh and the Chinese flag be taken to Beijing to offer to Chairman Mao. We were deeply moved as we held the Chinese flag with both hands. From the red glow of the flag, we saw the revolutionary heart of the elderly woman and the people of South Vietnam, and from the stitches on the flag, we saw the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam.

"Greetings to Uncle Mao!"

During our visit to South Vietnam, we deeply felt the boundless love and respect of the South Vietnamese military and people for Chairman Mao and saw them studying Chairman Mao's works diligently during the intervals of their intense battles.

We met many cadres, soldiers, and villagers from South Vietnam, and they repeatedly asked about Uncle Mao in their conversations, wishing Uncle Mao good health. On October 1, the Chinese National Day, the cadres and soldiers of the South Vietnamese liberation army quietly gathered around the radio, listening to the live broadcast of the celebration parade in front of Tiananmen Square in Beijing. When Chairman Mao appeared on the Tiananmen rostrum, they joined millions of Chinese people in shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" In the southern liberation zone, we saw many provincial and county leaders studying Chairman Mao's works under dim oil lamps, taking notes. In the camps of the South Vietnamese liberation army, we saw simple printing presses in the South printing Chairman Mao's works on people's war, passing them from one person's hands to another. Many guerrilla fighters could recite fluently Chairman Mao's sixteen-character formula for guerrilla warfare: "The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy halts, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue."

In a certain place, a local leader from South Vietnam introduced her struggle experience to us. She said that in 1961, when the enemy was establishing "strategic hamlets" everywhere, she and her comrades found ways to destroy them. At that time, she attended an important meeting called by her superiors, studied the directives, and discussed how to act. During the meeting, she studied "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and was inspired by the article "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." She said, "I paid special attention to the issue of mobilizing and arming the peasants." Later, she and her comrades led the peasant masses in a coastal province to launch a vigorous campaign to destroy "strategic hamlets," achieving glorious victories. She excitedly told us, "We will use the magic weapon of people's war to completely defeat the enemy." When we visited the suburbs of Da Nang, a comrade who led the urban struggle in Da Nang came to visit us. As soon as he entered the room, he enthusiastically shook our hands and greeted Uncle Mao. He excitedly told us, "Uncle Mao has a heavy burden! He is holding high the great red flag of world revolution, leading everyone forward!"

No matter how high the mountain strongholds or how remote the villages, we felt the love of the South Vietnamese people for Chairman Mao and the Chinese people. We cannot forget the night we spent in a remote village in Quang Nam Province. The sun had set, and the scorching heat gradually subsided. Soon, a crescent moon rose from the slender, graceful palm trees. At that moment, torches danced on the half-mountain slopes, embankments, and ditches, gradually forming a dragon of fire. The village leader told us, "The villagers agreed to hold a meeting here tonight to welcome you."

A few young people brought the only three old doors that had not been burned by the enemy, using stones to build a long table, and using a few rough bamboo sticks to make chairs. Then, the women brought several black lacquered wooden trays, filled with sticky rice balls, zongzi, fresh lychees, and freshly dug sweet potatoes.

All the villagers came, with the eighty-year-old grandmother Nguyen Thi Thao and the old man Nguyen Hai leading the way. Young guerrilla fighters carrying carbines marched in formation. Some women carried infants to the meeting. The lively children also squeezed in and out of the crowd. Soon, the long table was surrounded by people.

The eighty-year-old grandmother Nguyen Thi Thao was the first to be chosen by everyone to speak at the meeting to welcome us. She said, "This is the first time I have seen Chinese brothers, and my heart is indescribably happy. Many old people in our village have never left the county, but we all know that there is an Uncle Ho in the North and an Uncle Mao in Beijing, who always care for and support our struggle."

Then, the village leader spoke. He said, "The people in our village all love Uncle Mao and care for Uncle Mao. The words in Uncle Mao's books touch our hearts and greatly encourage us. We, the people of the South, are brave and strong, and the final victory of the revolution will be ours."

This mountain village had only twenty-eight households and ninety-four people, young and old. The village was surrounded by high mountains, and the villagers lived scattered on the half-mountain slopes and at the foot of the mountains. In 1962, the entire village, unable to bear the brutal rule of the American puppet regime, took up machetes and sticks, with the assistance of the liberation forces, defeated the puppet regime, and liberated their homeland. Since then, the American puppet regime has regarded this small mountain village as a "Viet Cong" base and has launched eighteen bloody "sweeps." The enemy burned down all the houses in the village, stole the cattle, and tried to force the entire village to move into a "strategic hamlet." However, the entire village put up a resolute struggle. They laid landmines, dug pits, built fighting villages, and repelled the enemy's attacks.

After the speeches, we talked as if we were old friends and comrades-in-arms who had not seen each other for a long time. The villagers used simple and sincere language to talk about their love and trust for Chairman Mao and the Chinese people. The nearly sixty-year-old grandmother Nguyen Thi Trieu said, "Please tell Uncle Mao that the people of the South miss him." An old man said, "We heard that Uncle Mao swam across the Yangtze River, and we are very happy about his health. In the future, after we drive away the American devils, we will definitely invite him to come to the South to visit."

The night deepened, and the mountain wind blew through the bamboo groves, rustling. The infants had already fallen asleep in their mothers' arms. We talked passionately, unaware that the east had already brightened. When the villagers said goodbye to us, they all enthusiastically held our hands, asking us to "greet Uncle Mao for them."

"We Offer to the Chinese Comrades a Sincere Revolutionary Red Heart"

During our visit, we climbed mountains and crossed rivers with the South Vietnamese comrades, went to the outskirts of Saigon and Da Nang, heavily guarded by the enemy, went to the frontlines where the battle was raging, and crossed the enemy's blockade lines. Every day, every segment of the journey, we personally felt the great fighting friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples.

During our visit, we received the meticulous care of the South Vietnamese comrades. When we crossed the enemy's blockade lines, we saw their silhouettes with guns; when we rested in the forest at night, we heard their soft footsteps treading on fallen leaves. During air raids, they pulled us into the safest places in the air-raid shelters. When we had just rested, they came to ask about our well-being. These comrades who helped us a lot during our visit, some we had seen, talked to, shaken hands with, and embraced; some we only saw their gun-carrying backs; and many we had not even seen. However, we had already deeply felt this fervent sentiment of class brothers.

Once, we visited the plain areas of Quang Ngai Province, and a guerrilla team from a certain commune was ordered to cover us. They somehow discovered that we were Chinese comrades and requested permission from their superiors to meet and talk with us. However, because we had to quickly cross the enemy's blockade lines to another place, we did not have time to talk with them. They then requested to shake hands with us. Thus, in the middle of the night, these guerrilla fighters and we shook hands tightly, exchanging warm greetings with our eyes.

Once, the South Vietnamese comrades held a grand welcome gathering for us in the forest. People held up portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Ho Chi Minh, held up large banners in Chinese and Vietnamese, and waved the five-star red flag and the red-blue-star flag. They shouted enthusiastically, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live Comrade Ho Chi Minh!" They sang "The East Is Red" and "Liberate the South" loudly. The crowd in the forest was so dense that it seemed to you that the crowd was denser than the trees, as if the 14 million people of the South had gathered in the forest, calling out to the 700 million Chinese people beside them. In the dense crowd, we suddenly saw Nguyen Thi Kim, the wife of Nguyen Van Troi. Her long black hair was tied with a black silk ribbon, and as we looked at the ribbon, the image of Nguyen Van Troi, standing tall and proud, flashed through our minds. We tightly grasped Nguyen Thi Kim's hand, and in our hearts, we silently said: We will learn from Nguyen Van Troi, live like Nguyen Van Troi, and fight like Nguyen Van Troi. We walked together into the venue. In the venue, the giant portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the five-star red flag, and the red-blue-star flag were hung together. A small orchestra played "The East Is Red." After the performance, people eagerly shook our hands and greeted us.

At this gathering, a responsible comrade from the South spoke in a loud voice, expressing the strong friendship of the South Vietnamese people for Chairman Mao and the Chinese people. He said, "The feelings between the peoples of China and Vietnam are not ordinary feelings but great feelings, feelings of class brotherhood, feelings of proletarian internationalism, feelings of sharing the same trenches, sharing joys and sorrows, sharing hardships, and fighting side by side, forged in blood, and bonded in flesh and blood, formed in the struggle against the common enemy led by American imperialism. We have always paid close attention to the glorious achievements of the 700 million Chinese people under the correct and wise leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by the respected Chairman Mao. These achievements have greatly strengthened the world revolutionary cause and strengthened our anti-American national salvation revolutionary cause in the South, which is a great encouragement to us. The people of South Vietnam regard these achievements as their own achievements."

This was indeed a gathering full of revolutionary enthusiasm and fighting friendship. At this gathering, we saw old comrades who had experienced countless battles and also saw little brothers and sisters wearing red scarves. Their enthusiastic applause welcoming us and their deep affectionate gaze made us think of the words of a responsible comrade of the South Vietnamese liberation army to us: "What we offer to the Chinese comrades is a sincere revolutionary red heart."

Throughout the visit, the heroic people of the South educated us every moment. Their indomitable revolutionary spirit educated us, and their internationalist spirit educated us. The people of South Vietnam fear no violence, fear no difficulties, dare to struggle, dare to win, and resolutely fight against American imperialism, setting a brilliant example for all revolutionary peoples in the world. The great victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam in the anti-American national salvation struggle are a great support to the Chinese people and are also a great support to the struggle of all peoples in the world against imperialism and colonialism. The friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples is an unbreakable friendship forged in the struggle against the common enemy. No matter what tricks and schemes American imperialism uses, the Chinese people will resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying out the anti-American national salvation struggle to the end.

### 越南南方人民热爱毛主席和新中国

专栏：越南南方通讯

    越南南方人民热爱毛主席和新中国
    我们在越南南方大约两千公里行程的访问中，不仅亲眼看到了越南南方军民的爱国主义、革命英雄主义和国际主义精神和在抗美救国斗争中的辉煌胜利，而且亲身感受到了站在反美斗争最前线的越南南方军民对毛主席、中国共产党和中国人民衷心的热爱和信赖。
    我们不论在长山山脉的丛山峻岭中，在湄公河畔的密林深处；也不论在岘港外围游击队的哨所里，在西贡河的渡船上，都被越南南方军民这种战斗的友谊深深地激动着。在痛击美国侵略者的中部高原和D解放区，解放军战士们背起枪从密林深处飞快地奔跑出来，象久别重逢的老战友一样，热烈地同我们紧紧握手拥抱，不断兴奋地高呼：“毛主席莫南（万岁）！”“中国莫南！”。在炮火纷飞的西贡市郊的某乡，一个近八十岁的老妈妈热泪盈眶地紧握着我们的手说，“亲人啊，你们到这里来了。谢谢毛主席，谢谢中国人民。我们南方人民同中国人民在一起，一定能够最后打败美国侵略强盗。”
    “我们永远站在一起”
    长山山脉，翠峰重叠。在浩瀚的林海里，亚热带的各种常青树木，竞赛似的一个劲儿往上长，直插云天，简直看不到树梢，只是一片密密麻麻的枝叶和悬在树干上的阔叶寄生草。我们在这原始的密林中穿行了许多天，在一天傍晚，终于来到了越南南方解放武装力量某地的前线指挥部。
    我们在前线指挥部受到了越南南方同志热情的欢迎。等他们安排我们到一间用竹子搭起来的小屋子里休息时，已经是深夜了。这时，忽然有几个人奔进房子里来，走在头里的是一个清秀的高个儿，穿着经过日晒雨淋已褪了色的黑军服。他刚跨进屋，没说一声，就象许多年没有见过的老战友一样，同我们一一热烈拥抱起来。前线指挥部的副司令员同志也跟着走进了屋，给我们介绍说：“这是我的老战友决同志，他听说中国同志到了，就连夜赶了三十里路，特地来看望你们。”
    决同志激动地对我们说，“这是我第一次见到中国同志，但我们不是新认识的朋友，而是早就并肩战斗的老战友。”
    经过南方同志们的介绍，我们才知道这位决同志已在南方坚持革命斗争二十多年，过去担任过昆嵩省的领导工作。在日内瓦协议签字后，美伪集团进行大屠杀的白色恐怖时期，他转移进了深山，蓄长发，学少数民族的语言和生活习惯，继续坚持革命斗争。那时，他和其他同志一起，长年累月出没在原始密林里同敌人进行战斗，没有盐吃，就吃草根炭，没有粮食吃，就吃野菜。为了祖国和人民的解放，他同千千万万南方同志一样，历尽千辛万苦，进行了英勇不屈的斗争。
    决同志盘腿坐在我们的身边，激动地同我们谈到了南方人民在那非常艰难的时期里同敌人进行的英勇斗争。他用激昂的音调对我们说，“在那乌云压顶的时间里，我们想到了胡主席和北方人民，也想到了毛主席和中国人民。毛主席和中国人民增加了我们的信心和勇气。南方人民是吓不倒，压不垮的。坚持革命斗争的同志，在极端困难的条件下，开辟了小块的革命根据地，领导人民拿起简陋的武器进行战斗，在深山密林中高举起革命的红旗。”
    决同志激动地伸过手来，紧紧地压在我们的手上。我们感到了中越人民之间的在艰苦的斗争中成长起来的战斗友谊的一股热流，在我们心海里翻腾。决同志说：“我们感谢毛泽东同志和中国人民在我们最困难的时刻里给予我们的支持。我们永远站在一起。你们在越南南方不管走到哪里，那里都能见到中越人民之间的战斗友谊。南方军民把毛泽东同志看作是最伟大的革命领袖，把中国人民看作是自己的真正战友和亲兄弟。”
    正象决同志所说的一样，我们在越南南方的访问中，到处都感受到了中越人民之间的最强烈的和最真挚的战斗友谊。我们也不能忘记，去年六月间，我们到平定省访问的时候，这个省的负责人庄严地捧着一面中国国旗，请我们带到北京献给毛主席。这面国旗是十六年以前平定省富美乡的一位老妈妈缝制的。那正是越南人民反对法国殖民者的战斗正在激烈进行的时候。为了庆祝中国国庆，这位老妈妈连夜一针一线地缝制了一面中国的五星红旗和一面越南的金星红旗，把它们挂在当地人民举行的庆祝中国人民胜利的集会的会场上。在日内瓦协议签字后，美伪集团疯狂进行血腥屠杀的时候，这位老妈妈为了保存这两面庄严的国旗，在一个没有月光的晚上，把它们折叠好放进一个陶瓷罐里，埋入地下，珍藏起来。十年以后，越南南方解放军把富美乡从美伪集团的魔爪下解放出来了。老妈妈含着眼泪从地下挖出了陶瓷罐，把这两面珍藏了整整十年的国旗取出来。后来，老妈妈设法托人把它送到了省里，并且要求把越南国旗带到河内献给胡主席，把中国国旗带到北京献给毛主席。我们十分激动地用双手捧着这面中国国旗，我们从国旗的红光闪闪中看到了这位老妈妈和越南南方人民的革命红心，也从国旗上的针针线线中看到了中越两国人民的牢不可破的兄弟友谊。
    “向毛伯伯问好！”
    我们在越南南方访问的时候，到处深深地感受到了越南南方军民对毛主席的无限热爱和尊敬，看到了他们在紧张的战斗的间隙中努力学习毛主席著作。
    我们会见过许多越南南方的干部、战士和乡亲们，他们在谈话中都是一次再次地问候毛伯伯，祝毛伯伯身体健康。在十月一日中国国庆的时候，南方解放军的干部和战士静静地靠在收音机周围，倾听北京市人民在天安门前的庆祝游行的实况广播。当毛主席出现在天安门城楼上的时候，他们同千千万万中国人民一起，欢呼“毛主席莫南（万岁）！”在南部解放区，我们看到了许多省和县的负责人在昏暗的小油灯下孜孜不倦地学习毛主席著作，做学习笔记。在南方解放军的营地里，我们看到了南方简陋的印刷厂印刷的毛主席论述人民战争的著作，从一个人的手里传到另一个人的手里。许多游击队员都能熟练地背诵毛主席关于游击战的十六字诀：“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追。”
    在某地，越南南方的一位地方负责人向我们介绍她的斗争经历时说，在一九六一年敌人到处建立“战略村”的时候，她和她的战友们就想方设法来搞掉“战略村”。她当时去参加一个上级召开的重要会议，学习上级的指示，讨论如何行动。在会议期间，她学习了《毛泽东选集》，从《湖南农民运动考察报告》那篇文章中得到了启发。她说：“我特别注意到发动和武装农民的问题”。后来，她和她的战友们在沿海的一个省份，领导着农民群众把捣毁“战略村”的斗争轰轰烈烈地开展起来，取得了辉煌的胜利。她激动地对我们说：“我们要用人民战争的法宝来彻底战胜敌人。”在我们访问岘港市郊区的时候，一位领导岘港市城市斗争的同志赶来看望我们。他刚一走进屋子，就热情地拉着我们的手，问候毛伯伯。他激动地对我们说：“毛伯伯的担子重啊！他老人家举着世界革命的大红旗，带领着大家前进！”
    不论是多么高耸的山寨，也不论是多么偏僻的乡村，我们都感到了越南南方人民对毛主席和中国人民的热爱。我们不能忘记在广南省的一个偏僻的乡村中度过的一个夜晚。太阳西沉了，干燥灼人的炎热开始渐渐退减。不一会，一弯新月，从细长挺秀的槟榔树梢冉冉升起。这时，半山腰上，田埂上，水沟边，一个个火把在跳动，渐渐汇成了一条火龙。这个村的负责人对我们说：“我们村里大伙儿约定，今天晚上在这里举行集会，欢迎你们。”
    几个青年扛来了没有被美伪军烧掉的村里仅有的三块旧门板，用石头搭成了一张长桌子，又用几块粗竹片搭成了椅子。接着，妇女们捧来了好几只黑漆木盘，里面装着糯米团子，粽子，鲜荔枝和刚挖出的嫩白薯。
    全村的人都来了，围格子巾的八十岁的老妈妈阮氏超和老大爷阮亥走在头里。青年游击队员扛着卡宾枪，列队走过来。一些妇女抱着婴儿参加了集会。那些爱热闹的儿童也在人群中挤进挤出。不一会，长桌四周都挤满了人。
    八十岁的老妈妈阮氏超第一个被大家推选出来在集会上致词欢迎我们。她说，“这是我第一次看到中国兄弟，心里说不出的高兴。我们村里许多老人有的没有出过乡界，有的没有出过县界。但是，我们都知道，北方有个胡伯伯，北京有个毛伯伯，他们时时刻刻关心和支持我们的斗争。”
    接着，这个村的负责人讲了话。他说，“我们村里人都热爱毛伯伯，关心毛伯伯。毛伯伯书里的话句句说到我们心里，大大鼓舞着我们。我们南方人是勇敢坚强的，革命的最后胜利一定属于我们。”
    这个山村只有二十八户，男女老幼九十四口人。村子的四周都是高山，村民们散居在半山腰和山脚下。一九六二年，全村人民不堪美伪集团的残酷统治，拿起砍刀、木棍，在解放武装力量的协助下，打垮了伪政权，解放了家乡。从此，美伪集团把这个小小的山村看作是“越共”的根据地，先后发动了十八次血腥的“扫荡”。敌人把全村的房屋烧光，抢走耕牛，企图强逼全村老少迁进“战略村”。但是，全村人民进行了坚决的反抗，他们埋地雷，挖陷阱，建立战斗村，打退了敌人的进攻。
    讲话以后，我们就象久别重逢的亲人和老战友一样谈起来。村民们用朴实而真挚的语言谈到了他们对毛主席和中国人民的热爱和信赖。年近六十岁的阮氏翠老妈妈说，“请你们告诉毛伯伯，我们南方人民都想念他。”一个老大爷说，“我们听说毛伯伯游泳过长江，都为他的身体健康而非常高兴。将来我们赶走美国鬼子以后，一定请他老人家到南方来看看。”
    夜深了，山风吹过竹丛，簌簌作响。婴儿已经在母亲怀里熟睡了。我们热烈地畅谈着，不知不觉东方已经发白了。村民们在同我们告别的时候，都热情地拉住了我们的手，要我们代他们“问毛伯伯好”。
    “我们献给中国同志的是一颗赤诚的革命红心”
    我们在访问中同南方同志一起爬山涉水，一起到过美伪军重兵把守的西贡市郊和岘港市郊，一起到过战火纷飞的前线，一起越过敌人的封锁线。每一天，每一段行程，我们都亲身感受到了中越人民之间伟大的战斗友谊。
    我们在访问中得到了南方同志的无微不至的关怀。我们在穿越敌人封锁线的时候，看到了他们的持枪的侧影，我们在丛林的深夜中休息的时候，听到了他们巡逻时轻轻的脚步踩在落叶上的沙沙的声音。在敌机轰炸的时候，他们把我们拉进了防空洞里最安全的地方。在我们刚歇下脚的时候，他们就赶来问寒问暖。这些在我们访问中给过我们很多帮助的同志，有的我们见过面，谈过话，握过手，拥抱过；有的我们只见过持枪的背影，更多的我们连见也没见过。但是，我们都已深深地感受到了这种阶级兄弟的热烈的感情。
    有一次，我们访问广义省的平原地区，某乡游击队奉命掩护我们。他们不知怎的发现了我们是中国同志，就要求上级和我们见见面，谈谈。但由于我们要迅速穿过敌人的封锁线到另外一个地方去，我们没有时间同他们交谈了。他们又要求和我们握一握手。于是在深夜里这些游击队员们和我们紧紧地握了手，用目光交换了热烈的问候。
    有一次，南方同志在丛林里举行了欢迎我们的盛大集会。人们高举毛主席和胡主席的画象，高举大幅的中越文的标语，手里挥舞着五星红旗和红蓝金星旗。他们纵情欢呼“毛主席莫南！”和“胡主席莫南！”，纵声歌唱《东方红》和《解放南方》。丛林里的人群是那样的密集，甚至使你感到人群比林木还要密，好象南方一千四百万人民都聚集在密林里，向身旁的七亿中国人民高声呼唤。在密密的人群里，我们一下发现了阮文追的妻子潘氏娟。她长长的黑发上结着一束黑绸带，我们望着绸带，心头闪出了阮文追气贯长虹的英雄形象。我们紧握着潘氏娟的手，心里默默地说：我们要向阮文追学习，象阮文追那样生活，象阮文追那样战斗。我们一起走进了会场。在会场上，毛主席和胡主席的巨幅画象，五星红旗和红蓝金星旗高挂在一起。一支小乐队奏起了《东方红》。演奏过后，人们就争着和我们热烈握手、问候。
    在这次集会上，一位南方的负责同志用宏亮的声音，说出了南方人民对毛主席和中国人民强烈的友谊。他说，“中越两国人民之间的感情，并非是一种普通的感情，而是一种伟大的感情，是阶级友爱的感情，是无产阶级国际主义的感情，是在同一个战壕里同甘苦、共患难，用鲜血凝结起来，用骨肉打成一片，反对美帝国主义为首的共同敌人所结成的同志般的感情。我们一向关注着七亿中国人民在以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党的正确和英明领导下，所取得的辉煌成就。这些成就大大地加强了世界革命事业，加强了我们南方人民的抗美救国革命事业，这是给予我们的巨大鼓舞，越南南方人民把这些成就看成是自己的成就。”
    这真是一次充满着革命热情和战斗友谊的集会。这次集会上，我们见到了身经百战的老同志，也见到了带红领巾的小弟弟小妹妹。他们欢迎我们的热烈的掌声，向我们投来的深情的眼光，都不由得使我们想起南方解放军的一位负责同志对我们说过的一句话：“我们献给中国同志的是一颗赤诚的革命红心。”
    在整个访问过程中，英雄的南方人民每时每刻都在教育我们。他们顽强不屈的革命精神教育了我们，他们的国际主义精神教育了我们。越南南方人民不畏强暴，不怕困难，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，坚决同美帝国主义进行斗争，为全世界一切革命人民树立了光辉的榜样。越南南方人民在抗美救国斗争中取得伟大胜利，是对中国人民的巨大支援，也是对全世界人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争的巨大支援。中越人民之间的友谊是在反对共同敌人的战斗中成长的牢不可破的友谊。不管美帝国主义采取什么阴谋诡计，中国人民将坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底。
