Southern Fujian province has begun harvesting early rice. From the harvesting situation, it can be seen that most areas have increased production compared to last year.

This year, the early rice planting area in southern Fujian is relatively large, and the transplanting was done at the right time. During the growth period of early rice, although there was continuous rain and pest infestations, the broad masses of cadres and community members, armed with the invincible thoughts of Chairman Mao, displayed a revolutionary spirit of daring to defy the heavens. They overcame various natural disasters and achieved an increase in early rice production. In the summer harvest, various places have reasonably arranged labor, improved harvesting methods, and paid attention to meticulous harvesting. The Terilin Brigade of Bangshan Commune in Longhai County organized community members to study Chairman Mao's relevant works to solve the contradiction between limited labor and tools and the large harvesting task. Everyone displayed a revolutionary spirit of not fearing hardship or fatigue, and the harvesting progress has accelerated. Currently, this brigade has harvested over 500 mu of early rice, basically achieving meticulous harvesting.

During the summer harvest, leading cadres at various levels have rushed to the front lines to work and study Chairman Mao's works together with the community members. They have solved problems in the summer harvest work according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

　　闽南社员敢与天斗
　　大部地区早稻增产
    福建省南部地区开始收割早稻。从收割的情况看，大部地区比去年增产。
    今年闽南地区的早稻种植面积较大，栽插得也很适时。在早稻生长期间，虽然遇到了连续阴雨，发生了病虫害，但用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的广大干部社员，发扬了敢与天斗的革命精神，终于战胜了各种自然灾害，获得早稻增产。各地在夏收中，合理安排劳力，改进收割方法，注意精打细收。龙海县榜山公社翠林大队，为解决劳力、工具少和收割任务大的矛盾，组织社员学习毛主席的有关著作，大家发扬不怕苦不怕累的革命精神，收割进度较前加快。目前，这个大队已收的五百多亩早稻，基本上做到精打细收。
    在夏收中，各级领导干部纷纷深入第一线和社员一起劳动，一起学习毛主席著作，根据毛主席的教导来解决夏收工作中的问题。
