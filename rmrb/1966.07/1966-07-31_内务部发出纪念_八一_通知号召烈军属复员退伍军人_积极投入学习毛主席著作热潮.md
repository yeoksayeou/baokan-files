The Ministry of Civil Affairs recently issued a notice regarding the commemoration of the 39th anniversary of the founding of the army on August 1, calling for the development of support for the military and preferential treatment for families of soldiers. The notice requires that all families of martyrs, soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, demobilized and retired soldiers must study Chairman Mao's works thoroughly, becoming active advocates for the practical application of Chairman Mao's teachings. They must also make further preparations to strongly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation. They should actively participate in the current proletarian cultural revolution and the socialist education movement in cities and rural areas, receiving profound class education through struggle.

The notice discusses the current situation, pointing out that at present, internationally, American imperialism has escalated its aggression in Vietnam to a new and more serious stage. This requires us to be highly vigilant, make further preparations, and continue to strongly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation until the American aggressors are thoroughly defeated. Domestically, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution is vigorously developing. Through this movement, the broad masses of the Chinese people have further recognized the great significance of studying Chairman Mao's works and are initiating a new wave of studying Chairman Mao's teachings. The notice calls on all families of martyrs, soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers to actively join this study movement. Only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought can we achieve one victory after another in the international and domestic class struggle.

The notice states that local civil affairs departments should, before and after August 1, under the leadership of local Party and government, in conjunction with the current international and domestic situation and traditional customs, carry out support for the military and preferential treatment for families of soldiers. They should mobilize all families of martyrs, soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers to carry forward the revolutionary tradition of self-reliance and hard struggle, actively participate in the current production struggle and scientific experiments, and make greater contributions to socialist construction. At the same time, they should propagate Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war and the great achievements and glorious traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, so that the objects of preferential treatment and the broad masses and grassroots cadres love our Party, state, and the great leader Mao Zedong, the founder of the people's army, even more. They should study the army thoroughly and love the army.

The notice also requires county-level and below civil affairs departments to, according to local actual situations, convene representative meetings or symposiums for families of martyrs, soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers, and widely carry out various propaganda activities. In cities and places where the army is stationed, memorial meetings or military-civilian joint celebrations can also be held.

The notice instructs all levels of civil affairs departments to supervise grassroots organizations to inspect the work of preferential treatment and demobilization resettlement, and inspect the situation of political and ideological education for families of martyrs, soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and retired soldiers. In places with summer harvests, they should inspect the situation of preferential treatment for labor points participating in the summer harvest pre-distribution.
