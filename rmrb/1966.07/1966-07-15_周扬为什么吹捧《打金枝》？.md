After 1960, Zhou Yang advocated for the creation of large-scale historical dramas everywhere, urging writers to use ancient stories to criticize the present, attack the Party Central Committee, and socialism.

Under his influence, Meng Chao produced a poisonous arrow, "Li Huimang," and Tian Han released a poisonous weed, "Xie Yaohuan." Before this, Zhou Yang personally directed the creation of "Hai Rui's Memorial," using the words of an ancient person to curse the Party's leadership. Especially malicious was Zhou Yang's statement at a historical drama symposium: "...assuming that Marxism-Leninism at a certain time and place has only one school and no other branches, this is very wrong.... If we say that Marxism-Leninism is finally completed in China, this is Hegelian thinking." Zhou Yang opposes the great Mao Zedong Thought, how malicious!

This black gang leader, Zhou Yang, not only tries to attack the Party Central Committee and socialism through new historical dramas but also uses traditional plays to maliciously slander the Party's leadership. There is a traditional Shanxi Bangzi opera called "Beating the Golden Branch." The story is about how, during the Tang Dynasty, Guo Ziyi's son, Guo Wei, had a conflict with his wife, Princess Shengping, because she did not bow to Guo Ziyi on his birthday. Shengping went to the palace to cry, and Guo Ziyi, fearing punishment, bound his son and sent him to the emperor. The Tang emperor not only did not punish the Guo family but also promoted Guo Wei, ordering the young couple to reconcile. Zhou Yang and Xia Yan highly praised such an opera that sings the praises of a feudal emperor. In September 1963, Zhou Yang, at the Beijing Opera Work Symposium, recommended "Beating the Golden Branch" and other traditional operas as "model operas" to the nation. Xia Yan also promoted this opera everywhere, saying it should be performed "even in a communist society." Why did they treat this opera as a treasure? Originally, there is an unspoken plot. As early as June 1956, Zhou Yang, at the first national opera repertoire work conference held by the Ministry of Culture, said: "The political philosophy, ethics, and principles of loyalty and filial piety that the Chinese people have accumulated over a long period in feudal society are all feudal things, but we can still learn something from them. For example, 'Beating the Golden Branch,' some say it is bad, but I think it is good. We can learn from it. Guo Wei beat his wife because she did not bow to his father, and Guo Ziyi bound his son and sent him to the emperor to apologize. Guo Ziyi has a philosophy. The emperor handled this matter well, 'as the saying goes, not deaf, not blind, not a family member.' Can we also learn from this politician's demeanor when something happens? This relationship is to blame oneself, not others, to make others feel at ease, and not harbor grudges. The Chinese people value this, I think this is necessary."

What does Zhou Yang's black speech mean? Originally, Zhou Yang has long harbored resentment against Chairman Mao's criticism of their mistakes in the 1930s. Therefore, he used this opera to vent his deep hatred. Zhou Yang said: "Can we learn from this politician's demeanor when something happens?" Listen to Zhou Yang's implied meaning, how arrogant and malicious! He actually uses a feudal emperor to attack our great Party's leadership. He said: "Blame oneself, not others, make others feel at ease, and not harbor grudges," isn't this slandering the Party Central Committee for criticizing them wrongly? This is no different from their cursing the Party's leadership in the poisonous weeds like "Hai Rui Resigns" and "Hai Rui's Memorial" through Hai Rui's mouth! We absolutely do not allow the black gang members to slander our great Party and the Party Central Committee's leadership so maliciously. We must fight them to the end!

### 周扬为什么吹捧《打金枝》？

　　周扬为什么吹捧《打金枝》？
　　文化部艺术局　刘英华
    一九六○年以后，周扬到处鼓吹大编历史剧，鼓动作家借古讽今，影射现实，攻击党中央和社会主义。
    在他的鼓动下，孟超抛出了一支大毒箭《李慧娘》，田汉放出了一株大毒草《谢瑶环》。在此以前，周扬还亲自出马，布置创作《海瑞上疏》，借古人之口，对党的领导破口大骂。特别恶毒的是，周扬还在一次座谈历史剧的会上说：“……以为马列主义到了一定的时候、一定的地方，就只有一家，别无分店，这是很不对的。……我们如果讲马列主义到中国是最后完成的，这是黑格尔思想。”周扬反对伟大的毛泽东思想，多么恶毒！
    周扬这个黑帮头子，不仅通过新编历史剧想方设法攻击党中央和社会主义，还通过传统剧目挖空心思地对党的领导进行污蔑和咒骂。山西梆子有一个传统剧目叫《打金枝》，故事写唐代郭子仪之子郭暧，因其妻升平公主不向郭子仪拜寿，发生冲突，升平进宫哭诉。子仪畏罪，绑子上殿。唐王对郭家父子不仅未加罪责，反而加封郭暧，叫小夫妻和好。对这样一出歌颂封建皇帝的传统戏，周扬、夏衍等人极力推崇。一九六三年九月，周扬在首都戏曲工作座谈会上，把《打金枝》和其它一些传统剧目，作为戏曲的“样板戏”，向全国推荐。夏衍还到处鼓吹这出戏“直到共产主义社会也要演”。他们为什么要把这出戏奉为至宝呢？原来这里边有不可告人的阴谋。早在一九五六年六月，周扬在文化部召开的第一次全国戏曲剧目工作会议上就说过：“中国人民长期在封建社会里积累的政治哲学、伦理哲学、君臣父子之道等，尽管都是封建的东西，但我们还是可以从这里面学到一些东西。比如《打金枝》，有人说不好，但是我认为它很好。我们可以从它里面学到东西，郭暧因为妻子不给自己的父亲拜寿，就不管她是公主而打了她，郭子仪就把儿子捆起来，送到皇帝面前请罪，郭子仪是有一套哲学的。皇帝对这件事处理得很好，‘所谓不痴不聋，不作阿家阿翁’。我们是不是在发生了什么事故时，也可以去学一学这种政治家的风度呢？这种关系，就是责备自己，不责备别人，使别人心安，不心怀芥蒂。中国人很讲这一套，我看这一套东西是需要。”
    周扬的这段黑话，究竟是什么意思呢？原来周扬对毛主席在一九四二年批评他们三十年代的错误一直怀恨在心。因此，他就借这出戏来发泄自己的刻骨仇恨。周扬说：“是不是在发生了什么事故时，也可以去学一学这种政治家的风度呢？”听一听周扬这弦外之音，是何等猖狂，何等恶毒！他竟敢利用一个封建皇帝，肆意攻击我们伟大的党的领导。他说：“责备自己，不责备别人，使别人心安，不心怀芥蒂”，这不是诬蔑党中央对他们批评错了吗？这与他们《海瑞罢官》《海瑞上疏》等大毒草中借海瑞之口咒骂党的领导，又有什么不同呢？我们绝不允许黑帮分子如此恶毒污蔑我们的伟大的党和党中央的领导，我们要同他们坚决斗争到底！
