	Philippine representative Amado Hernandez today at the plenary session of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, enthusiastically praised Comrade Mao Zedong as the "great teacher and leader of the world's people, and the inspirational force and beacon for all emerging nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

	In his speech, he condemned American imperialism's colonial rule over the Philippines. He said, "The revolution of the Filipino people has been ongoing for centuries. We have fought against every invader. Now we are fighting against the new colonialists of American imperialism."

	Hernandez exposed the various crimes committed by American imperialism in the Philippines. He said, "In the Philippines, political detention means being detained by the Americans." He mentioned that he himself had been sentenced to imprisonment for being accused of being an "enemy of American democracy and the American way of life, a friend of Mao Zedong." He said that today, the Johnson administration is pushing and pulling the Philippine government, dragging it into the shameful war of aggression against Vietnam.

	Hernandez said, "The progressive and revolutionary Filipino people have raised a storm of strong protests."

	He said, "The peoples of Asia and Africa have united. We will march forward together and fight together against our common enemy. On the battlefield, we will show no mercy to the enemy."

	He said, "The Filipino people are today supporting the Vietnamese people's life-and-death struggle against American imperialism. The Vietnamese people will definitely win, and they will surely win, this is beyond doubt."

	Hernandez enthusiastically spoke about the long-standing friendship between the Filipino and Chinese peoples. He said, "It is not the vast ocean that separates our two peoples, but the insatiable American imperialism. We express our respect and deep gratitude to the government and people of China led by the great revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. We salute Comrade Mao Zedong! We embrace you!" He concluded with a shout, "Long live our beloved Chairman Mao Zedong, the invincible leader guiding the People's Republic of China to prosperity and happiness!"

    菲律宾代表埃尔南德斯的发言
    新华社一日讯　菲律宾代表阿马多·埃尔南德斯今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上，热烈称颂毛泽东同志是“世界人民的伟大导师和领袖，是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲一切新兴国家的鼓舞力量和灯塔”。
    他在发言中谴责美帝国主义对菲律宾的殖民主义统治。他说，菲律宾人民的革命已经进行了几个世纪。我们曾经同每一个外来的入侵者进行过战斗。现在我们正在与美国帝国主义新殖民主义者战斗。
    埃尔南德斯揭露了美帝国主义在菲律宾所犯下的种种罪行。他说，在菲律宾，政治关押就是被美国关押。他说，他自己就曾经由于被控是“美国民主和美国生活方式的敌人，毛泽东的朋友”而被判处徒刑。他说，今天，约翰逊政府正在对菲律宾政府又推又拉，把它推进可耻的侵略越南的战争中去。
    埃尔南德斯说，进步和革命的菲律宾人民掀起了强烈抗议的风暴。
    他说，亚非人民已经团结起来，我们要一道前进，共同斗争，反对我们共同的敌人。在战斗的舞台上，我们对敌人要毫不留情。
    他说，菲律宾人民今天正在支持越南人民反对美帝国主义的生死斗争。越南人民一定要胜利，一定能胜利，这是肯定无疑的。
    埃尔南德斯热情地谈到菲律宾人民同中国人民历史悠久的友谊。他说，把我们两国人民隔离开来的不是辽阔的海洋，而是贪得无厌的美帝国主义。我们向伟大的革命巨人毛泽东同志领导下的中国政府和人民表示敬意和深切的感谢。我们向毛泽东同志致敬，我们拥抱你！他最后高呼：“领导中华人民共和国走向繁荣和幸福的战无不胜的领袖，我们敬爱的毛泽东主席万岁！”
