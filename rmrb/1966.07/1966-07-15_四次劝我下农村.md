I and Comrade Liu Yingjun are primary school classmates.
This spring festival, Comrade Liu Yingjun returned to Changchun to visit his family, just in time for me to be on vacation at home. I told him, "The organization calls on us to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production labor, but I want to go to the industrial front." Comrade Liu Yingjun heard this and said, "Going to the countryside to participate in agricultural production labor is the Party's call, and we should actively respond. Participating in agricultural labor is relatively arduous, but as a young person, one should carry heavy burdens! Serving the people, how can one negotiate conditions?" Hearing his words, my heart burned especially fiercely. After a fierce struggle in my thoughts, I said, "You can rest assured, once the motherland needs me, I will participate in agricultural production!" He heard me say this and his face showed a smile.

After returning to the unit, he was still not at ease and wrote to encourage me again and again: "Give a red heart to the Party, and do whatever the Party asks!" Not a few days later, it was just three days before his martyrdom, that he wrote me another letter, the fourth time to help me. As soon as I received the letter, I saw a quotation from Chairman Mao on the envelope:
"Socialist institutions have opened up a path to our ideal world, but the realization of the ideal world still depends on our hard work. Some young people think that once they enter a socialist society, everything will be fine, and they can enjoy a ready-made happy life without effort. This is an unrealistic idea."

I opened the letter and saw that he had written inside:
"In the article 'The Direction of the Youth Movement,' Chairman Mao pointed out: 'How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard do we use to distinguish them? There is only one standard, that is, to see if they are willing and actually do combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants. Those who are willing and actually combine with workers and peasants are revolutionary, otherwise they are not revolutionary, or even counter-revolutionary.'"

He said, "This is the standard for revolutionary youth. The road is chosen by oneself, I hope you choose the right path forward."

In this letter, he also said, "In the article 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People,' Chairman Mao also said: 'We hope that the intellectuals of our country will continue to advance, gradually establish a communist worldview in their work and study, gradually learn Marxism-Leninism, and gradually blend in with the workers and peasants, and not stop halfway, let alone retreat, because retreat has no way out.' I hope you will study Chairman Mao's works diligently, arm our minds with Chairman Mao's thoughts. You also mentioned in your letter learning from Comrade Wang Jie, obeying the Party's arrangement, but I hope you can do as you say, combining theory with practice."

Reading these letters full of Mao Zedong Thought, time and time again, I firmly decided to go to the agricultural front. Not only did I volunteer to participate in agricultural production, but like Comrade Liu Yingjun, I also persuaded the families of three classmates to go to the countryside with me. On March 17, with boundless excitement, I reported this news to Comrade Liu Yingjun, but by then he had already sacrificed himself to save others and had parted with us forever...

The hero has sacrificed himself, but the hero listened to Chairman Mao's words, enthusiastically spread Mao Zedong Thought, and used Mao Zedong Thought to educate others. This spirit will forever inspire and encourage me, making it unforgettable. I am determined to learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun, dedicate a red heart to the Party, and with a loyal heart for the people, be red in the countryside, and be dedicated in the countryside, and work hard for a lifetime to build a new socialist countryside!

　　四次劝我下农村
　　田瑞莲
    我和刘英俊同志是小学同学。
    今年春节，刘英俊同志回长春探家，正赶上我休学在家。我告诉他说：“组织上号召我们到农村去参加农业生产劳动，可是我想到工业战线上去。”刘英俊同志听了以后说：“下乡参加农业生产劳动，这是党的号召，咱们应该积极响应。参加农业劳动，是比较艰苦，可是，作为一个青年，就应该挑重担子嘛！为人民服务，怎能讲条件呢！”听了他的话，我心里烧得特别厉害，经过一番激烈的思想斗争，我说：“你放心，一旦祖国需要，我就参加农业生产！”他听我这么一说，脸上露出了笑容。
    回到部队以后，他还不放心，又二次三次写信鼓励我：“把一颗红心交给党，党叫干啥就干啥！”隔不几天，也就是在他牺牲前的第三天，他又给我写来了一封信，第四次帮助我。我一拿到信，就看见了他在信皮上写的一条毛主席语录：
      “社会主义制度的建立给我们开辟了一条到达理想境界的道路，而理想境界的实现还要靠我们的辛勤劳动。有些青年人以为到了社会主义社会就应当什么都好了，就可以不费气力享受现成的幸福生活了，这是一种不实际的想法。”
    我打开信一看，他又在里面写道：
    “毛主席在《青年运动的方向》一文中指出：‘看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。’”
    他说：“这就是革命青年的标准。道路是自己选择的，但愿你选择好自己前进的道路。”
    在这封信上，他还说：“毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》一文中又讲到：‘我们希望我国的知识分子继续前进，在自己的工作和学习的过程中，逐步地树立共产主义的世界观，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，逐步地同工人农民打成一片，而不要中途停顿，更不要向后倒退，倒退是没有出路的。’望你努力学习毛主席著作，用毛主席的思想武装我们的头脑。你来信也讲向王杰同志学习，听从党的分配，但望你能说到做到，理论结合实际。”
    看了他这些充满毛泽东思想的来信，一次又一次地使我坚定了到农业战线上去的决心。我不但自己报名参加了农业生产，还象刘英俊同志那样说服了三名同学的家庭，让她们和我一同去农村。三月十七日，我怀着无限激动的心情，向刘英俊同志报告了这个消息，哪知这时他已经舍己救人，光荣牺牲，和我们永别了……。
    英雄牺牲了，英雄听毛主席的话，热情地传播毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想教育别人的精神却永远鼓舞着我，激励着我，使我永生难忘。我决心向刘英俊同志学习，一颗红心献给党，一片忠心为人民，红在农村，专在农村，为建设社会主义新农村好好地干一辈子！
