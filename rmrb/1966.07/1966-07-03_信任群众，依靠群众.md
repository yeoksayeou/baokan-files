A great mass movement of the proletarian cultural revolution is sweeping the country. Millions of revolutionary masses, in response to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, are waging a sharp struggle with a mighty force against the representatives of the bourgeoisie who are anti-party and anti-socialism. The demons and monsters have fallen into the vast ocean of the masses and have suffered unprecedented severe blows.

To mobilize the masses and use the methods of mass movements to carry out the proletarian cultural revolution is a great innovation.

The fundamental characteristic of this proletarian cultural revolution is that hundreds of millions of people have risen up to criticize the old world.

Chairman Mao tells us: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can only be waged by mobilizing the masses and can only be waged by relying on the masses."

This is a universal truth. Revolutionary war is like this, all undertakings of the proletariat are like this, and the proletarian cultural revolution is certainly like this. Without mass movements, there is no proletarian revolution. Similarly, without mass movements, there is no proletarian cultural revolution.

In the past, our Party, in waging the revolutionary war to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, relied on the broad masses of the people. It was under the leadership of Chairman Mao that the organized masses of the people overthrew the old China ruled by the Kuomintang reactionaries and established the new China of proletarian dictatorship. Today, our Party, in waging the proletarian cultural revolution that touches the soul of man, must also rely on the broad masses of the people. Whether using the gun to criticize the old world or using the pen to criticize the old world, we must rely on the masses of the people.

The proletarian cultural revolution is the revolutionary cause of the masses. Throughout the entire process of the proletarian cultural revolution, we must rely on the masses and mobilize the masses. Only by mobilizing the masses and launching mass movements, posting big-character posters, speaking out, airing views fully, and holding great debates, can we make the proletarian cultural revolution develop extensively and deeply, expose all the demons and monsters, overthrow them, and truly solve the problem of who will win in the ideological realm between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and successfully complete the task of the proletarian cultural revolution.

History has already proven that the broad revolutionary masses are the gravediggers of the reactionary state machine and the reactionary social system. History will also prove that the broad revolutionary masses are the gravediggers of all the ideological systems of the exploiting classes.

Among the broad masses of the people, there is tremendous enthusiasm for the cultural revolution. In recent years, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and especially the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, have achieved great success in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have mastered Mao Zedong Thought. In class struggle, in production struggle, and in scientific experiments, they have used Chairman Mao's works very well. In the current proletarian cultural revolution, they have also used Chairman Mao's works very well. They are the true iron wall defending proletarian dictatorship. They are the main force in destroying the ideological and cultural positions occupied by the representatives of the bourgeoisie. If this is underestimated, it would be a grave mistake.

In the past few months, the surging proletarian cultural revolution has proven:

The broad masses of the people who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought have the strongest ability to identify demons and monsters; they see the clearest and recognize the most;

The broad masses of the people who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought fight the demons and monsters the best; they aim the most accurately and strike the hardest;

The broad masses of the people who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought are the best at struggling and the best at using the method of presenting facts and reasoning to refute the representatives of the bourgeoisie, leaving them with no defense.

In the past few months, the surging proletarian cultural revolution has proven:

The leadership of the Communist Party of China armed with Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

The correct leadership of the Party is to be good at following the mass line and to consistently place the mobilization of the masses as the fundamental principle of the movement. Trusting the masses and relying on the masses is the source of our Party's boundless strength. Trusting the masses, relying on the masses, and mobilizing the masses to launch mass movements is a very important policy for our Party to carry out the proletarian cultural revolution.

Whether or not to trust the masses and rely on the masses, and whether or not to dare to mobilize the masses, is the dividing line between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview, and is also a fundamental difference between a genuine Marxist-Leninist party and all revisionist parties. Our Party is powerful because it trusts the masses, relies on the masses, and dares to mobilize the masses. Only by standing at the forefront of the mass movement and mobilizing the masses can we play a leading role in the proletarian cultural revolution. If it is not like this, but rather fearing the masses and fearing mass movements, then it is impossible to talk about any leadership, which would violate the leadership principles that Chairman Mao often teaches us.

Chairman Mao teaches us that in the proletarian cultural revolution, we must organize and develop the ranks of the leftists of the proletariat, and rely on them to mobilize the masses, unite the masses, and educate the masses.

All over the country, there are steadfast leftists of the proletarian revolution. The vast majority of Communist Party members and Young Communist League members are reliable, and under the correct leadership of the Party, they are the core of the leftists of the proletarian revolution.

The leftists of the proletarian revolution listen to the Party the most, listen to Chairman Mao the most, are the bravest and most resolute in the revolution, are the best at uniting the majority, and can play a model role in the struggle. They are the vanguard of this proletarian cultural revolution.

Our Party must rely on the steadfast leftists in every place and every department. Do not be constrained by the wrong frameworks of rank, seniority, age, etc., and organize the steadfast leftists as the backbone of the movement, boldly and thoroughly allowing them to play a leading role in the proletarian cultural revolution.

Only by relying on the steadfast leftists and mobilizing the masses can we truly implement the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, distinguish between true revolutionaries and false revolutionaries, revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries, and lead the proletarian cultural revolution to develop healthily.

Chairman Mao teaches us that the combination of leadership and the masses is a fundamental principle of the Party's leadership methods. In the proletarian cultural revolution, this principle must also be adhered to.

The mass line is the fundamental line of the Party in all work. The masses of the people are the source of strength for all our revolutionary work. By relying on the masses of the people, we can overcome all difficulties and defeat all enemies, and do all work well. If we separate from the masses of the people, we will become water without a source and a tree without roots, and we will achieve nothing. Chairman Mao said: "Every comrade should understand that as long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creative power of the masses of the people is boundless, and thus trust the people and unite with the people, then we can overcome any difficulty and no enemy can press us down, but will be pressed down by us." In the great proletarian cultural revolution, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, trust the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and unite with the masses of the people to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

    信任群众，依靠群众
    《红旗》杂志一九六六年第九期社论
    一个无产阶级文化革命的伟大的群众运动，正在全国兴起。千百万革命群众，响应党中央和毛主席的号召，以雷霆万钧之力，对反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物，展开了尖锐的斗争。牛鬼蛇神陷入了广大群众的汪洋大海包围之中，他们遭到了空前的严重打击。
    发动广大群众，用群众运动的方法，进行无产阶级文化大革命，这是伟大的创举。
    亿万人民群众起来批判旧世界，是这场无产阶级文化大革命的一个根本特点。
    毛主席告诉我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”
    这是一个普遍的真理。革命战争是这样，无产阶级的一切事业是这样，无产阶级文化大革命当然也是这样。没有群众运动，就没有无产阶级革命。同样，没有群众运动，也就没有无产阶级文化大革命。
    过去，我们党进行推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义统治的革命战争，是依靠广大人民群众的。正是在毛主席领导下，组织起来的广大人民群众，打倒了国民党反动派统治的旧中国，建立了无产阶级专政的新中国。今天，我们党进行触及人的灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命，也必须依靠广大人民群众。无论用枪杆子批判旧世界，还是用笔杆子批判旧世界，都必须依靠人民群众。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是群众的革命事业。在无产阶级文化大革命的整个过程中，都必须依靠群众，放手发动群众。只有动员群众，大搞群众运动，出大字报，大鸣、大放、大辩论，才能使无产阶级文化大革命广阔深入地开展，才能把一切牛鬼蛇神暴露出来，把他们打倒，才能真正解决在意识形态领域中无产阶级和资产阶级之间谁战胜谁的问题，胜利完成无产阶级文化大革命的任务。
    历史已经证明，广大的革命群众是反动国家机器的埋葬者，是反动社会制度的埋葬者。历史也必将证明，广大的革命群众是一切剥削阶级意识形态的埋葬者。
    在广大人民群众中，蕴藏着极大的文化革命的积极性。近几年来，革命干部，革命知识分子，特别是广大的工农兵群众，活学活用毛主席著作，获得了巨大的成绩。他们掌握了毛泽东思想。在阶级斗争中，在生产斗争中，在科学实验中，他们用毛主席著作用得很好。在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，他们用毛主席著作也用得很好。他们是捍卫无产阶级专政的真正的铜墙铁壁。他们是摧毁为资产阶级代表人物盘踞的思想文化阵地的主力军。如果低估了这一点，那就要犯绝大的错误。
    几个月来，波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命运动证明：
    掌握了毛泽东思想的广大人民群众，对于牛鬼蛇神的识别能力最强，他们看得最清，认得最明；
    掌握了毛泽东思想的广大人民群众，对于牛鬼蛇神战斗得最好，他们瞄得最准，打得最狠；
    掌握了毛泽东思想的广大人民群众，最善于进行斗争，最善于用摆事实、讲道理的方法，把资产阶级代表人物驳斥得体无完肤。
    几个月来，波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命运动证明：
    以毛泽东思想武装起来的中国共产党的领导，是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的根本保证。
    党的正确领导，就是要善于走群众路线，就是要自始至终把放手发动群众作为运动的根本。信任群众，依靠群众，是我们党的无限力量的源泉。信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动，是我们党进行无产阶级文化大革命的一个极其重要的方针。
    是否信任群众、依靠群众，敢不敢放手发动群众，这是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的分水岭，也是真正的马克思列宁主义政党同一切修正主义政党的一个根本区别。我们党所以有力量，就在于信任群众，依靠群众，敢于放手发动群众。只有站在群众运动的前头，放手发动群众，才能在无产阶级文化大革命中发挥领导作用。如果不是这样，而是害怕群众，害怕群众运动，那就根本谈不上什么领导，那就违背毛主席经常教导我们的党的领导原则。
    毛主席教导我们，在无产阶级文化大革命中，必须组织、发展无产阶级左派队伍，并且依靠他们发动群众，团结群众，教育群众。
  全国各地，到处有坚定的无产阶级革命左派。绝大多数共产党员、共青团员，是可以信赖的，在党的正确领导下，他们是无产阶级革命左派的核心。
    无产阶级革命左派最听党的话，最听毛主席的话，他们在革命中最勇敢、最坚决，他们最善于团结多数，他们能够在斗争中起模范作用。他们是这场无产阶级文化大革命的先锋。
    我们党必须依靠各个地方、各个部门的坚定的左派。不要受级别、资历、年龄等等错误框框的束缚，把坚定的左派组织起来，作为运动的骨干，大胆放手地让他们在无产阶级文化大革命中发挥带头作用。
    只有依靠坚定的左派，放手发动群众，才能真正贯彻执行毛主席和党中央的指示，才能辨明真革命和假革命、革命和反革命，才能领导无产阶级文化大革命，使运动健康地发展。
    毛主席教导我们，领导与群众相结合是党的领导方法的一个根本原则。在无产阶级文化大革命中，也必须坚持这个原则。
    群众路线是党在一切工作中的根本路线。人民群众是我们一切革命工作的力量源泉。依靠人民群众，我们就能克服一切困难，战胜一切敌人，做好一切工作。离开人民群众，我们就会变成无源之水，无本之木，我们就将一事无成。毛主席说：“应该使每一个同志懂得，只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要遵照毛主席的指示，信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，和人民群众打成一片，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
