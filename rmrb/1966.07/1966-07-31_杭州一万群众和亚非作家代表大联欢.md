Ten thousand masses in Hangzhou held a grand gala with representatives of the Asian and African Writers' Emergency Conference tonight.

At 8 p.m., the lake gala began with the solemn and stirring song "The East is Red." More than one hundred boats, laden with joy and friendship, slowly left the shore and headed towards the lake's center. At this moment, the revolutionary songs "The Ship Sails with the Helmsman," drumbeats, slogans, and laughter intertwined, resonating over West Lake. Each beautifully decorated boat had either a statue of Chairman Mao or a model of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Surrounding the statues and models were golden lights. Some boats had banners reading "Long Live Chairman Mao." The people of Hangzhou expressed their boundless love for Chairman Mao, their unshakable faith in his works, and their unwavering loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought through these decorated boats. Asian and African friends passing by these boats applauded enthusiastically. Some Asian and African friends, moved, sang "The East is Red" in Chinese, while others shouted, "Long Live Chairman Mao!" Mohamed Dahman, a representative from the French Somaliland Coast, jumped up and shouted, "Long Live Chairman Mao! Long Live Chairman Mao!" after disembarking. Mohamed Ali Hemedi, a representative from Tanzania, seeing the statue of Chairman Mao, told his hosts, "Chairman Mao is not only the red sun in your hearts but also in ours. Mao Zedong Thought not only illuminates the path to victory for the Chinese revolution but also for the world revolution." Many boats also displayed large banners reading "Vietnam Will Win, the U.S. Imperialists Will Be Defeated." Electric models and lantern shows depicted the Vietnamese people's brave and tenacious struggle against U.S. imperialism. Other boats carried models of steel flowers, bountiful harvests, and great achievements in industrial and agricultural production. These models embodied the great victories of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Asian and African friends were moved and praised, saying that China's achievements demonstrated the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought.

The boats slowly approached the White Causeway. The welcoming crowd on the causeway beat drums, fired cannons, played music, sang, and danced, welcoming the Asian and African friends ashore for the gala. On the lawn of Solitary Hill, guests and hosts sat together, watching performances by the workers, peasants, and soldiers of Hangzhou, including the collective dance "Sunflowers Turn to the Sun," the street play "Vietnam Will Win, the U.S. Imperialists Will Be Defeated," and farmer singer Fang Yaosheng's solo "Harvest Song." These performances received enthusiastic applause from the Asian and African friends, who repeatedly praised the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and congratulated the workers, peasants, and soldiers on becoming the masters of revolutionary culture.

    杭州一万群众和亚非作家代表大联欢
    据新华社二十九日讯　杭州一万群众今晚和出席亚非作家紧急会议的各国代表在西湖举行大联欢。
    八时，湖上大联欢在庄严而激动人心的《东方红》歌声中开始。满载着欢乐和友谊的一百多条游船徐徐离岸，向湖心进发。这时，《大海航行靠舵手》的革命歌声、锣鼓声、口号声和欢笑声，交织在一起，震荡在西湖上空。一条条装饰精美的彩船上，有的放着毛主席的象，有的放着《毛泽东选集》模型，在毛主席像和模型的周围装饰着金色的灯光，有的船上写着：“毛主席万岁”的标语。杭州人民用这些彩船表达了他们对毛主席无比热爱、对毛主席著作无限信仰、对毛泽东思想无比忠诚的心愿。亚非朋友们从这些彩船边驶过，不断热烈鼓掌。有的亚非朋友激动地用中国话唱《东方红》，有的高呼：“毛主席万岁！”索马里海岸（法属）代表穆罕默德·达汉上岸后激动地跳起来连声高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”坦桑尼亚代表穆罕默德·阿里·赫迈迪看到毛主席象，对陪同的主人说：“毛主席不仅是你们心中的红太阳，也是我们心中的红太阳。毛泽东思想不仅照亮了中国革命胜利的道路，也照亮了世界革命胜利的道路。”许多彩船上还出现了“越南必胜，美帝必败”的大字标语，电动模型、走马灯表演着越南人民英勇顽强打击美帝的情景。还有许多彩船上载着钢花飞溅、五谷丰登、工农业生产大发展，社会主义建设新成就的模型。这些模型体现了在毛泽东思想指引下，总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的伟大胜利，亚非朋友激动地赞扬说，中国取得的这些成就，显示出毛泽东思想的无比威力。
    游船缓缓驶近平湖秋月。白堤上欢迎的人群敲锣打鼓，鸣炮奏乐，载歌载舞，欢迎亚非朋友上岸联欢，在孤山的草坪上，宾主席地而坐，观看了杭州工农兵群众演出的《葵花向太阳》集体舞、《越南必胜、美帝必败》活报剧以及农民歌手方耀生独唱的《丰收山歌》等革命歌舞节目。这些节目博得了亚非朋友热烈的掌声，他们一再赞扬无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成就，祝贺工农兵群众成了革命文化的主人。
