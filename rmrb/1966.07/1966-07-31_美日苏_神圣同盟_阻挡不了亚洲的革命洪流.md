The Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko visited Japan from July 24 to 30, holding a series of "frank and warm" talks with Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and Foreign Minister Mitsuo Ishii. They discussed "friendship, cooperation, peace," and "friendship" between the Soviet Union and Japan. They studied the situation in Vietnam, the "Chinese problem," and other international issues. They signed the Soviet-Japanese Consular Convention, discussed "economic cooperation," and further agreed that in the future, the foreign ministers and ministerial-level officials of the two countries would hold "regular meetings." All this indicates that the collusion between the Soviet revisionist leadership and the Japanese reactionaries has reached a new stage.

The US and Japan have long had a military alliance treaty. Now, the Soviet Union and Japan have also established a so-called "Economic Cooperation Committee," holding annual meetings. The government ministers of the two countries will also hold regular meetings to consult. Thus, the new anti-revolutionary "holy alliance" of the US, Japan, and the Soviet Union in Asia has actually taken shape.

Gromyko followed in the footsteps of Rusk to Japan. Rusk's visit to Tokyo was mainly to plot an aggressive military alliance in Asia with Japan as the core, further strengthening the encirclement of China, and strengthening the suppression of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Vietnam, Korea, and various countries in Asia. Rusk openly praised the collusion between Japanese militarism and the Soviet revisionist leadership, serving the policy of the US imperialists' strategic shift to the East. Gromyko in Tokyo also shouted that the Soviet Union maintaining friendly relations with Japan is of great significance and role for the peace and prosperity of Asia. Rusk and Gromyko, one calling the other, openly put the "Chinese problem" on the agenda during the Soviet-Japanese talks. Their eagerness to unite against China has made them forget to hide their true faces.

Another dirty mission of Gromyko's visit to Japan was to extinguish the anti-American flames of the Vietnamese people. To cover up this shameful betrayal, he played a clumsy two-faced game. Gromyko had to express in public that the "Vietnamese dispute is the result of American aggression," as if the Soviet revisionist leadership was not interested in "negotiations." But everyone saw that after the US imperialists brazenly bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, pushing the "bombing to force negotiations" plot, Moscow immediately became a market for selling American-style "negotiations." Indian Prime Minister, British Prime Minister, and the likes of the United Nations Secretary-General, one leaving, one entering, bustling with activity, surpassing the lively scene of the US, Japan, and Britain plotting the Eastern Munich conspiracy in Tokyo back then. And at this moment, the Sato government of Japan openly supported the US imperialists' crimes of expanding the war in Vietnam, spreading the idea of holding a "peace conference" on the Vietnamese issue in Tokyo, and revealing that Japan and the Soviet Union would cooperate in this regard. Gromyko hurried to Tokyo in such an atmosphere, singing such tunes, what kind of evil deeds are they up to, isn't it clear enough?

Gromyko also discussed "economic cooperation" with the Sato government during this visit. Not long ago, the two sides held the first meeting of the "Soviet-Japanese Economic Cooperation Committee" in Tokyo, and the Soviet side proposed a massive plan to seek help from Japanese monopolies to "develop" Siberia. This time, Gromyko openly requested assistance from Japanese monopolies, hoping that "Soviet-Japanese cooperation will develop more and more." The Soviet revisionist leadership has degenerated to the point of opening the door wide for Japanese monopolies to infiltrate the Soviet Union. This is a great betrayal of Soviet national interests and a great betrayal of the fundamental interests of the Soviet people.

The formation of the "holy alliance" of the US, Japan, and the Soviet Union is based on their deep hatred of socialist China and their mad hostility towards the revolutionary forces in Asia.

US imperialism has always regarded Japanese militarism as its main pillar for implementing its policy of aggression and war in Asia. Especially since the US strategic focus shifted to the East, regarding China as its main enemy, the position of Japanese militarism in the US counter-revolutionary global strategy has become even more important. US imperialism is trying to fully revive Japanese militarism as its main henchman for launching aggressive wars in Asia.

Under the active patronage of US imperialism, after the Sato government came to power, Japanese militarism has become increasingly active. It is accelerating the expansion of its military and preparations for war, signing the "Japan-Korea Treaty," forming an anti-communist alliance in Asia, and drafting one military plan after another aimed at Korea, China, and the peoples of Asia. It is directly involved in the US imperialists' war of aggression in Vietnam and is rapidly expanding outward. Japanese militarism is eager to try, deluding itself with the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

The Soviet revisionist leadership, in close coordination with the US imperialists' strategic shift to the East, not only promotes "détente" in Europe but also actively supports and encourages the full revival and external expansion of Japanese militarism in Asia. Even before Khrushchev's downfall, the Soviet leadership had already, under the line of "US-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," been pursuing a policy of "smiling diplomacy" towards the Japanese ruling class, showing great enthusiasm. The current Soviet leadership's collusion with Japanese reactionaries is even more blatant, loudly praising the Sato government's "love of peace" and "efforts for peace," calling militaristic Japan an "Asian stabilizing force" and a country "leading in Asia." They actively advocate strengthening "cooperation between Japan and the Soviet Union" and taking "joint action on a series of important issues." In the past year or so, the collusion between Japan and the Soviet Union has become increasingly close, with frequent visits between the top figures of both sides, reaching one "cooperation" agreement after another. Kosygin openly declared at the beginning of this year: "Soviet-Japanese relations have entered a new era of friendship and goodwill." It is clear that the Soviet revisionist leadership is trying to realize the evil plan of "US-Japan-Soviet cooperation to dominate Asia," which is a component of the line of "US-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world."

Chairman Mao said: "There is an old Chinese saying, 'Birds of a feather flock together.' Japanese leaders like Kishi Nobusuke and Hayato Ikeda are good friends of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The Japanese people are good friends of the Chinese people." Now, whose good friends are the Soviet revisionist leadership? They are good friends of US imperialism and Japanese militarism, good friends of Johnson and Sato. They have formed a gang with US imperialism, Japanese militarism, the Indian reactionaries, and various lackeys and accomplices of US imperialism, getting along hot and heavy, jointly opposing the Chinese people, Japanese people, Vietnamese people, Korean people, and the revolutionary peoples of Asia and the world. This is the essence of the "joint action" advocated by the Soviet revisionist leadership.

What attitude to take towards the "joint action" proposed by the Soviet revisionist leadership is a severe test for every proletarian party. Now, some people advocate "united action," which is simply a replica of the counter-revolutionary slogan of "joint action." Following this path will inevitably lead to collusion with revolutionary traitors and the Soviet revisionist leadership. When it comes to this, how can one still talk about fighting against US imperialism and the monopoly capitalist groups in one's own country?

The fact that US imperialism, Japanese militarism, and the Soviet revisionist leadership have formed an anti-revolutionary "holy alliance" in Asia shows what? It precisely shows that their situations are all very dire, their days are getting worse, and they can only rely on tightening their collusion and mutual dependence to boost their morale. But what use is this? Today's Asia is no longer the Asia of the past. The 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have become a powerful backbone for the revolutionary peoples of various countries. The heroic Vietnamese people's anti-American war has achieved brilliant victories. The Japanese people are awakening more than ever before. The revolutionary flames are burning fiercely all over Asia. In this great new era, US imperialism, Japanese militarism, and the Soviet revisionist leadership delude themselves that they can use this new counter-revolutionary union to stop the blazing revolutionary flames in Asia, which is absolutely impossible. On the contrary, the peoples of Asia will definitely awaken and unite even more from these living negative examples provided by these negative teachers, strengthen the revolutionary offensive, thoroughly smash this counter-revolutionary "holy alliance," and push the cause of achieving thorough liberation to victory!

    美日苏“神圣同盟”阻挡不了亚洲的革命洪流
    观察家
    苏联外长葛罗米柯，于七月二十四日至三十日访问了日本，同日本首相佐藤荣作和外务大臣椎名悦三郎举行了一系列“坦率而且热情的”会谈。他们大谈苏日之间的“亲善合作”、“和平”和“友谊”。他们研究了越南局势、“中国问题”和其它国际问题。他们签订了日苏领事条约，讨论了“经济合作”，并且进一步商定，今后将由两国外交部长和部长级官员举行“定期会议”。这一切表明，苏联修正主义领导集团和日本反动派之间的勾结，已经发展到了一个新的阶段。
    美日之间，早就有了军事同盟条约。现在，苏日之间也建立了所谓“经济合作委员会”，每年举行一次会议。两国的政府部长还要定期开会协商。这样，美、日、苏在亚洲新的反革命“神圣同盟”，已经事实上形成。
    葛罗米柯是紧跟着腊斯克的脚后跟到日本去的。腊斯克的东京之行，主要是策划以日本为核心的侵略性的亚洲军事同盟，以进一步加强对中国的包围圈，加强镇压越南、朝鲜和亚洲各国人民的革命斗争。腊斯克公然赞许日本军国主义同苏联修正主义领导集团相勾结，为美帝国主义战略重点东移的政策效劳。葛罗米柯在东京也叫嚷苏联同日本“保持友好关系，对亚洲的和平和繁荣，具有巨大的意义和作用”。腊斯克和葛罗米柯此呼彼应，在苏日会谈中，又公然把“中国问题”列入议程。他们联合反华的心情之切，已经使他们顾不得自己真面目的暴露了。
    葛罗米柯访日的另一个肮脏使命，就是要扑灭越南人民的反美烈火。为了掩饰这种无耻的叛卖行为，他玩弄了拙劣的两面手法。葛罗米柯在公开场合不得不表示，“越南争端是美国进行侵略的结果”，似乎苏联修正主义领导集团对“和谈”不感兴趣。但是谁都看到，在美帝国主义悍然轰炸河内、海防，推行“以炸迫和”的阴谋以后，莫斯科立即成了推销美国式“和谈”把戏的集市。印度总理、英国首相、联合国秘书长之流的政治掮客，一个离去，一个进门，车水马龙，较之当年美、日、英在东京搞东方慕尼黑阴谋的热闹景象，有过之无不及。而就在这个时候，日本佐藤政府公然支持美帝国主义在越南扩大战争的罪行，放出空气要在东京召开有关越南问题的“和平会议”，并且透露日苏之间将在这方面进行“合作”。葛罗米柯在这种气氛中匆匆飞往东京，唱出了那么一些调子，他们在搞些什么样的罪恶勾当，难道还不够清楚吗？
    葛罗米柯这次去东京，还同佐藤政府大谈“经济合作”。前不久，苏日双方已经在东京举行了“日苏经济合作委员会”第一次会议，苏联方面提出了乞求日本垄断资本帮助它“开发”西伯利亚的庞大计划。这一次，葛罗米柯又公然要求日本垄断资本给予“援助”，希望“日苏合作得到越来越大的发展”。苏联修正主义领导集团竟然堕落到为日本垄断资本渗入苏联大开方便之门。这是对苏联国家权益的大出卖，是对苏联人民根本利益的大出卖。
    美日苏“神圣同盟”的形成，是基于它们对社会主义中国的刻骨仇恨，基于它们对亚洲革命力量的疯狂敌视。
    美帝国主义一向把日本军国主义当作它在亚洲推行侵略政策和战争政策的主要支柱。特别是由于美国的战略重点东移，把中国当成它的主要敌人，日本军国主义在美国反革命全球战略中的地位，就更加重要。美帝国主义力图全面复活日本军国主义，作为它在亚洲发动侵略战争的主要打手。
    在美帝国主义的积极扶植下，佐藤政府上台以后，日本军国主义势力越来越活跃起来。它加速扩军备战，缔结“日韩条约”，拼凑亚洲反共联盟，拟订了一个又一个的矛头指向朝鲜、中国和亚洲人民的军事计划。它直接参与美帝国主义的侵越战争，加紧向外扩张。日本军国主义正在跃跃欲试，妄图重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦。
    苏联修正主义领导集团，紧密配合美帝国主义战略重点的东移，不仅在欧洲大搞“和缓”，而且在亚洲积极支持和鼓励日本军国主义的全面复活和向外扩张的野心。早在赫鲁晓夫下台以前，苏联领导集团就已经在“美苏合作主宰世界”的投降主义路线的支配下，对日本统治集团推行“微笑外交”，大献殷勤。苏联现领导同日本反动派的勾结就更加露骨，大肆吹捧佐藤政府“爱好和平”，“为和平而努力”，把军国主义的日本称为“亚洲的稳定力量”，“在亚洲居于领导地位”。它们主动积极地鼓吹加强“日本和苏联合作”，在“一系列重要问题上采取联合行动”。在过去一年多时间内，日苏勾结越来越紧密，双方当权人物，来往频繁，达成了一个又一个的“合作”协定。柯西金在今年初公开宣称：“日苏关系已经进入友好亲善的新时代”。很清楚，苏联修正主义领导集团妄想实现“美日苏合作主宰亚洲”的罪恶计划，是“美苏合作主宰世界”这条投降主义路线的一个组成部分。
    毛主席说：“中国有句古话，物以类聚，人以群分。日本的岸信介和池田勇人是美帝国主义和蒋介石集团的好朋友。日本人民同中国人民是好朋友。”现在，苏联修正主义领导集团是谁的好朋友呢？他们是美帝国主义和日本军国主义的好朋友，是约翰逊和佐藤的好朋友。他们同美帝国主义、日本军国主义、印度反动派，以及美帝国主义形形色色的走狗和帮凶，结成同伙，搞得火热，共同反对中国人民、日本人民、越南人民、朝鲜人民以及亚洲和全世界的革命人民。这就是苏联修正主义领导集团的所谓“联合行动”的实质。
    对苏联修正主义领导集团提出的“联合行动”采取什么态度，是每一个无产阶级政党面临的严峻考验。现在，有些人提出什么“统一行动”，完全是“联合行动”这个反革命口号的翻版。沿着这条道路走下去，势必同革命的叛徒，同苏联修正主义领导集团同流合污。到了这种地步，还谈得上什么反对美帝国主义和反对本国垄断资本集团的斗争呢？
    美帝国主义、日本军国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团，在亚洲结成反革命“神圣同盟”这件事，表明了什么呢？正好是表明了它们的处境都非常不妙，日子越来越不好过，只能以加紧互相勾结、互相依靠来为自己壮胆助威。但是，这又有什么用呢？今天的亚洲再也不是过去的亚洲了。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，已经成为各国革命人民的强大后盾。英勇越南人民的抗美战争，取得了辉煌的胜利。日本人民正在空前觉醒。革命烈火在亚洲到处熊熊燃烧。在这样一个伟大的新时代，美帝国主义、日本军国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团，妄想用新的反革命联合，来阻止亚洲革命的燎原烈火，是绝对办不到的。相反，亚洲人民一定会从这些反面教员提供的活生生的反面教材里，进一步觉醒和团结起来，加强革命的攻势，彻底打碎这个反革命的“神圣同盟”，把争取彻底解放的革命事业胜利地推向前进！
