The revolutionary masses engage in a head-to-head struggle with bourgeois technical "authorities" and "experts," vigorously promote revolutionization, significantly accelerate construction speed, save a large amount of investment, and occupy less farmland.

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, Changsha, July 5 — The newly constructed Liyuan Railway in Hunan Province was put into trial operation ahead of schedule on July 1.

This narrow-gauge railway from Liling County to Yonghe in Liyuan County is 105 kilometers long. From the official start of construction in December last year to its basic completion, it took only seven months. Its rapid completion demonstrates the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought.

At 7:30 AM on July 1, a celebration meeting for the trial operation of the entire line was held at the Liyuan Railway Station. Many people arrived at the station early in the morning, beating drums and gongs to celebrate the Party's birthday and the opening of the Liyuan Railway. An 80-year-old old peasant ran 15 kilometers to attend the celebration. He excitedly said, "Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are truly great. With Chairman Mao's wise leadership, we can create any miracle in the world!"

Huang Huoqing, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and Vice Governor of Hunan Province, Vice Governor Xu Ming, and Deputy Secretary of the Xiangtan Prefectural Party Committee Gao Shentang attended the celebration meeting. Huang Huoqing spoke at the meeting, representing the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and the Hunan Provincial People's Committee in extending warm congratulations to all the workers, staff, and people of Liling and Liyuan counties. He said, the rapid completion of the Liyuan Railway is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the General Line, and a powerful response to the anti-Party, anti-socialist elements like the Deng Tuo clique who brazenly oppose Mao Zedong Thought and the General Line. He encouraged all the workers and staff to continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and make the Liyuan Railway a truly revolutionary railway that conforms to Mao Zedong Thought.

After the celebration meeting, two passenger trains departing from the Liyuan Railway Station, carrying railway builders and representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants from nearby communes, set off to Liling and Yonghe amidst the sound of firecrackers and cheers.

The construction process of the Liyuan Railway was a process of honestly following Mao Zedong Thought. From the beginning to the end, from cadres to workers, the focus was on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in all aspects of work, treating Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive for all work, making the entire railway construction site a school for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the construction unit focused on the ideological revolutionization of people, cultivating a construction team with a national vision, international perspective, and proletarian consciousness. Throughout the construction process, there was a sharp struggle between the two classes and two lines. The project committee, relying on the broad masses of workers, poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, engaged in a head-to-head struggle with bourgeois technical "authorities" and "experts." They used Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, breaking old things and establishing new ones, and in the surveying, design, and construction of the lines and bridges, they vigorously promoted revolutionization, saving a large amount of investment. They also occupied 180 fewer acres of farmland and created 300 more acres of farmland. All these farmlands were handed over to the local production teams without compensation, receiving praise from the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants along the line.

The Liyuan Railway is a narrow-gauge railway, and many sections require cutting through mountains to build the road, making the engineering task very arduous. After the railway is completed and put into operation, it can transport more than 60 million tons of goods annually. The freight cost per ton-kilometer is half that of trucks and one-fifth that of wooden sailboats. It not only solves the transportation problem of phosphate ore from the important phosphate mine production base in Hunan Province, Liyuan Phosphate Mine, but also creates extremely favorable conditions for the development of agricultural and sideline production and local industry in the communes along the line, for the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and for the convenience of people's transportation. It will also make a significant contribution to the development of agricultural production.

    有毛主席领导就能创造任何人间奇迹
    醴浏铁路七个月建成提前试通车
    革命群众同资产阶级技术“权威”“专家”进行针锋相对斗争，大搞革命化，大大加快修建速度，节约大量投资并少占用农田
    新华社长沙五日电　湖南省新修建的醴浏铁路已提前在七月一日试通车。
    这条从醴陵县到浏阳县永和的窄轨铁路，全长一百零五公里，从去年十二月正式开工到基本建成，总共只用了七个月的时间。它的迅速建成，显示了毛泽东思想的无比威力。
    “七一”上午七时半，在浏阳火车站举行了庆祝全线试通车大会。许多人一大早就敲锣打鼓来到车站，庆祝党的生日和醴浏铁路通车。一位八十多岁的老贫农跑了十五里路来庆贺，他激动地说：“毛主席、共产党真伟大，有毛主席的英明领导，不管什么人间奇迹我们都能创造出来！”
    中共湖南省委书记处书记、湖南省副省长华国锋，副省长徐明，湘潭地委副书记高臣唐等参加了庆祝大会。华国锋在大会上讲话，代表中共湖南省委、湖南省人委向全线民工、职工和醴陵、浏阳两县人民表示热烈的祝贺。他说，醴浏铁路的迅速建成，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是总路线的伟大胜利，是对邓拓黑帮等一小撮反党反社会主义分子肆意反对毛泽东思想、反对总路线的一个有力回击。他勉励全体民工、职工要继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把醴浏铁路办成一条真正符合毛泽东思想的革命化的人民铁路。
    庆祝大会结束后，由浏阳车站开出的两列客车，满载铁路建设者和附近社队的贫农、下中农代表，在鞭炮声、欢呼声中，开向醴陵和永和。
    醴浏铁路修建的过程，是建设者们老老实实按照毛泽东思想办事的过程。在工程建设中，从干部到民工，自始至终把活学活用毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位，把毛主席的书作为一切工作的最高指示，使整个铁路工地成为一座活学活用毛主席著作的学校。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，修建单位狠抓人的思想革命化，培养了一支胸怀祖国，放眼世界，有无产阶级觉悟的革命化的施工队伍。在修路过程中，贯穿着两个阶级和两条道路的尖锐斗争。工程处党委紧紧依靠广大工人、贫农、下中农和革命的知识分子，同资产阶级技术“权威”、“专家”进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们以毛泽东思想为指针，大破大立，在线路和桥梁的测量、设计、施工等方面，大搞革命化，节约了大量投资，并且少占农田一百八十多亩，还新造了田土三百多亩。这些农田全部无偿地交给了当地生产队，受到沿线广大贫下中农的好评。
    醴浏铁路是一条窄轨铁路，许多地段要劈开一座座大山才能筑路，工程任务相当艰巨。铁路建成通车后，每年可运货六十万吨以上。每吨公里货物的运费，比汽车节省一半，比木帆船节省五分之二。它不仅解决了湖南省磷矿生产重要基地——浏阳磷矿的矿石运输问题，而且对沿线人民公社农副业生产和地方工业的发展，对沟通城乡物资交流，便利人民交通，都创造了极为有利的条件。对发展农业生产，也将作出有力的贡献。
