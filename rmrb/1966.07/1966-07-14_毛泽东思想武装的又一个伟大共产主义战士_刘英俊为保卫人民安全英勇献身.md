Another great communist warrior armed with Mao Zedong Thought has emerged in the country. Liu Yingjun, a soldier from a certain artillery unit in Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province, sacrificed his life to protect the safety of the people. He loved the Party and Chairman Mao deeply, studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, and actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought. He was a model who treated Chairman Mao's books as the highest directives. The people of Jiamusi City said, "This is the Lei Feng and Wang Jie we have seen with our own eyes." The Party Committee of the unit posthumously recognized him as a formal member of the Communist Party of China and called for a campaign to learn from Liu Yingjun.

On March 15, Jiamusi was still covered in ice and snow. In the morning, Liu Yingjun and his fellow soldiers from the Third Platoon of the artillery unit were driving three artillery carriages along the suburban road for training. Near the bus stop, the horse pulling Liu Yingjun's carriage was startled by the sound of a car horn and suddenly ran wild. At that time, it was the peak hour for students going to school and workers going to work, with vehicles and pedestrians bustling about. The horse and carriage were charging towards the crowd, and the situation was extremely dangerous. Liu Yingjun used his shoulder to forcefully push against the neck of the startled horse, making it turn onto a small path on the left side of the road, thus avoiding a potential serious accident. The horse continued to run wildly on the small path covered with ice and snow on both sides, dragging Liu Yingjun along, putting him in a very dangerous situation. The onlookers shouted, "Let go! Let go!" At that moment, there were six children in front of the artillery carriage, frozen in fear. Their lives were in grave danger. Liu Yingjun firmly replied, "I can't let go! I can't let go!" At this critical moment, Liu Yingjun wound the reins around his arm several times and pulled hard, making the horse's front hooves lift off the ground. Immediately, he disregarded the danger, propped himself up on the yoke, and stretched his legs from under the yoke towards the horse's hind legs, kicking with all his might. The horse fell, the carriage overturned, and the six children were saved. Liu Yingjun himself was crushed under the overturned carriage and horse, sustaining severe injuries.

The crowd who witnessed this selfless heroic deed were both respectful and moved, rushing forward. Neighborhood committee member Yang Shumin and others quickly rescued Liu Yingjun and rushed him to the nearby textile factory's clinic for emergency treatment. At this time, many waiting passengers did not board the bus, workers did not go to work, and students did not go to school. They were all moved by Liu Yingjun's heroic deed and followed closely behind, asking, "Who is he? What is his name?" Yang Shumin, tears in her eyes, replied, "He is our brother!" Outside the hospital, several hundred people and soldiers gathered, all eager to donate blood for the hero. They said, "We must save him! Whatever is needed, we will provide, as long as he is saved!"

In the operating room, the rescue of the hero was in full swing. Ambulances loaded with plasma, oxygen, and emergency medicines arrived one after another from various hospitals in the city. Over thirty leaders and doctors from Jiamusi Medical College Affiliated Hospital, Army Hospital, and other institutions also rushed to the scene. The dean of the affiliated hospital had just finished an operation at his own hospital and rushed over without even changing his clothes or boots to direct the rescue efforts. After more than three hours, due to the severity of his injuries, Liu Yingjun's rescue efforts were unsuccessful, and he sacrificed his life gloriously. However, the crowd waiting outside the operating room refused to leave, and the surgeon Ju Yunsheng was still checking Liu Yingjun's pulse, feeling that the hero's pulse was still beating. He excitedly told the people, "Such a hero will not die!"

Liu Yingjun was born in a poor peasant family in the suburbs of Changchun City, Jilin Province. He was 21 years old. In the summer of 1962, when the Kuomintang bandits were threatening to invade the mainland, he joined the People's Liberation Army with a deep hatred for the class enemy and a desire to defend the motherland. He loved the Party and Chairman Mao deeply and loved socialism. After enlisting, he diligently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, establishing a proletarian worldview under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought: "Revolution means struggle, and struggle is happiness; live for revolution, die for revolution." He was a model who treated Chairman Mao's books as the highest directives for all his actions. He actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought, expanding the influence of Mao Zedong Thought. He bravely defended Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely fought against any words or deeds that went against Mao Zedong Thought. He took Lei Feng and Wang Jie as his examples, doing as Chairman Mao said, and serving the people wholeheartedly. He once wrote in a letter, "... No matter how long a person lives, if his death is dedicated to the glorious cause of communism, it is infinitely glorious and meaningful. Lei Feng can do it, and so can I. Believe me, a hundred can do it!" He loved the people and had done many good deeds for the local workers and residents, establishing a deep class affinity with the people, although few knew his true name until after his sacrifice. The people loved this hero from the bottom of their hearts, saying he was "truly serving the people wholeheartedly" and "truly had Mao Zedong Thought in his mind and heart."

Heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought will forever live in the hearts of the people. After Liu Yingjun's sacrifice, many people called or went to the local newspaper office, requesting to widely publicize his glorious deeds. The people of Hejiang District and Jiamusi City held a solemn memorial meeting. The people of Jiamusi requested to bury Liu Yingjun in Jiamusi. They sent representatives to Liu Yingjun's mother, Zhu Xiulan, saying, "Liu Yingjun is your son, but he is also the son of the 300,000 people of Jiamusi. He sacrificed himself for us, and we will forever remember him, learn from him, and let his red heart forever be with the 300,000 people of Jiamusi." Liu Yingjun's mother said, "The child joined the army to defend the motherland, and I sent him off; now the people of Jiamusi need him, so I will leave him with the people of Jiamusi." Before and after the Qingming Festival, nearly 10,000 people in Jiamusi voluntarily went to Liu Yingjun's grave to pay their respects. Batch after batch of Young Pioneers and Communist Youth League members solemnly pledged here: to be like Liu Yingjun, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to be good soldiers and students of Chairman Mao. To commemorate the hero, the people planted a pine tree at the place where Liu Yingjun sacrificed himself. Around the pine tree, they built a five-star-shaped flower bed. The elderly and children often come to water and tend to the soil. People passing by all look at the pine tree with reverence, remembering the hero.

The Party Committee of Liu Yingjun's unit decided to posthumously recognize him as a formal member of the Communist Party of China, according to his wish before his death; to award him the First Class Merit, and to call on cadres and soldiers to launch a campaign to learn from Liu Yingjun. Currently, the broad masses of the people and the stationed troops in Jiamusi City are deeply carrying out the campaign to learn from Liu Yingjun. Everyone says: Liu Yingjun is our good example. Learning from Liu Yingjun means loving Chairman Mao deeply; learning from Liu Yingjun means studying and applying Chairman Mao's works diligently, being good soldiers and students of Chairman Mao.

　　毛泽东思想武装的又一个伟大共产主义战士
　　刘英俊为保卫人民安全英勇献身
    他无限热爱党和毛主席，活学活用毛主席著作，积极宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，是一个把毛主席的书当作最高指示的模范。佳木斯市人民说，这是我们亲眼看见的雷锋、王杰。解放军某部党委追认他为中国共产党正式党员，号召开展学习刘英俊的活动
    新华社十三日讯　在祖国东北黑龙江省佳木斯市，出现了一个为保卫群众生命安全而英勇献身的欧阳海式的英雄人物。他是驻军某部炮连战士，名叫刘英俊。人们热烈颂扬他“是毛主席教育出来的好战士”，“是我们亲眼看见的雷锋，亲眼看见的王杰”。
    三月十五日，佳木斯还是一片冰天雪地。早晨，炮连三班战士刘英俊和战友们赶着三辆炮车，沿着市郊公路出去训练。在公共汽车站附近，刘英俊驾驭的那辆炮车的辕马，被汽车喇叭声震惊，突然调头猛跑。当时正是学生上学、职工上班的时候，公路上车来人往，川流不息。车马向人群冲去，情况十分危急。刘英俊用肩膀猛抗狂奔着的惊马的脖子，迫使惊马拐上公路左侧的小道，避免了一次可能发生的严重事故。惊马继续在两旁积满冰雪的小道上飞跑，刘英俊紧拉缰绳，身子被车马拖带着，处境非常危险。群众见此情景，高声大喊：“快撒手！快撒手！”这时候，在炮车前面不远的地方，有六个孩子被吓呆了。孩子们的生命受到严重威胁。刘英俊坚定地回答：“不能撒！不能撒！”在这千钧一发的时刻，只见刘英俊把缰绳在胳膊上缠了几道，猛力一拉，使战马前蹄腾空而起。紧接着，他不顾危险，手撑辕杆，把双脚从辕杆下面伸向马的后腿，用尽平生的力量踢去。马倒了，车翻了，六名儿童安然脱险。刘英俊同志自己却被压在突然翻倒的车马底下，身负重伤。
    目睹这场舍己为人英雄行为的群众，又崇敬，又感动，一拥而上。居民组长杨淑敏大嫂等人急忙将刘英俊救起，立即把他抬送到附近纺织厂职工医院去抢救。这时，许多候车的乘客不乘车了，上班的工人不上班了，上学的学生不上学了，他们都被刘英俊的英雄行为激动着，关心地紧跟在后面。人们都急切地询问：“他是谁？叫什么名字？”杨淑敏大嫂热泪盈眶地回答：“他是咱的亲兄弟！”医院门前，立刻聚集了几百群众和战士，纷纷要求给英雄输血。他们说：“一定要把他抢救过来！”“要什么，给什么，只要把他救活就行！”
    外科手术室里，开始了抢救英雄的紧张战斗。救护车载着血浆、氧气和急救药品，一辆接一辆地从市区各个医院开来。佳木斯市医学院附属医院、陆军某医院等三十多名负责同志和医生，也都陆续赶到。附属医院院长刚在本院做完手术，连衣服、靴子都来不及换，就赶来主持这场抢救工作。三个多小时过去了，由于伤势过重，抢救无效，刘英俊同志光荣牺牲。然而，守候在手术室外的群众还是不肯离去，外科大夫朱云胜还是按着刘英俊的脉搏，总觉得英雄的脉搏还在跳动着。他激动地对人们说：“这样的英雄是不会死的！”
    刘英俊同志出生在吉林省长春市郊的一个贫农家庭里，今年二十一岁。一九六二年夏天，蒋介石匪帮叫嚣窜犯大陆的时候，他满怀着阶级仇恨和保卫祖国的志愿，参加了中国人民解放军。他无限热爱党和毛主席，热爱社会主义。入伍后，他自觉勤奋地活学活用毛主席著作，在毛泽东思想哺育下，树立了“革命就要斗争，斗争就是幸福”、“生为革命生，死为革命死”的无产阶级世界观。他是一个把毛主席的书当作一切行动最高指示的模范。他积极地宣传毛泽东思想，扩大毛泽东思想的阵地。他勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想，坚决向违背毛泽东思想的言论行为作斗争。他以雷锋、王杰为榜样，毛主席怎样说，他就怎样做，全心全意为人民服务。他曾经在一封信里写道：“……一个人无论是活多长时间，他的死，只要是献给党的壮丽的共产主义事业，那就是无限光荣的，有代价的。雷锋能，我也能，请相信我吧，一百个能！”他热爱人民，为当地的职工、居民做过许多好事，早就和人民群众建立了深厚的阶级感情，不过很少有人知道他的真名实姓，直到他牺牲之后，群众看到他的遗象才知道他叫刘英俊。人民从内心里热爱这位英雄，说他“真正是全心全意为人民服务”，“真正是把毛泽东思想装进了脑子里，刻在了心上”。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄，永远活在人民心中。刘英俊同志牺牲以后，许多人打电话或亲自到当地报社，要求大力宣传他的光辉事迹。合江地区、佳木斯市各界人民召开了隆重的追悼大会。佳木斯人民要求把刘英俊同志的遗体安葬在佳木斯。他们派代表向前来参加追悼会的英雄的妈妈朱秀兰请求说：“刘英俊是您的儿子，也是我们佳木斯三十万人民的儿子，他为我们牺牲了，我们要永远纪念他，向他学习，让他这颗红心永远和我们佳木斯三十万人民连在一起。”刘英俊的妈妈说：“孩子参军保卫祖国，是我送去的；现在佳木斯人民需要他，我就把他留给佳木斯人民吧！”清明节前后，佳木斯市近一万人自动到刘英俊墓前祭扫，一批又一批的红领巾和共青团员在这里庄严宣誓：要象刘英俊那样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。为了纪念英雄，群众在刘英俊牺牲的地点，栽上了一棵青松。青松的周围建造了一个五星形的花坛，老人、孩子常来浇水培土。人们经过这里，都用敬仰的目光观看青松，怀念英雄。
    刘英俊同志所在部队党委作出决定，根据刘英俊同志生前的志愿，追认他为中国共产党正式党员；追记一等功，并号召干部战士开展向刘英俊同志学习的活动。目前，佳木斯市广大群众和驻军部队，正在深入开展学习刘英俊同志的活动。大家说：刘英俊同志是我们的好榜样，学习刘英俊，就要象他那样无限热爱毛主席；学习刘英俊，就要象他那样活学活用毛主席著作，做毛主席的好战士、好学生。（附图片）
