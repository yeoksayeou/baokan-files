Mexican visitors to China have expressed strong support for China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They hailed Chairman Mao as the greatest teacher and guide for the revolutionary people of the world. They said the people of Latin America draw boundless strength from Chairman Mao's works.

According to a Xinhua news agency report from Mexico City, on the eve of the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, Mexican visitors who had been to China spoke to Xinhua reporters with great enthusiasm about Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

They told the reporters enthusiastically: Chairman Mao is the greatest teacher and guide for the revolutionary people of the world today. The brilliant Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly, always guiding the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world to the path of revolutionary struggle, to break free from shackles, oppression, and poverty, and to build a new world.

Carlos Zapata, a prominent figure in the legal field in Mexico and a former member of the House of Representatives, said in an interview with Xinhua reporters, "The greatness and correctness of Mao Zedong Thought have not only been proven by the history of the Chinese revolution's victory, but all the revolutions being waged by the people of the world will prove this. Therefore, Mao Zedong is the great teacher and guide of the Chinese people, and he is also the great teacher and guide of the people of the world. This is the pride of mankind."

He said that the people of Latin America who are engaged in revolutionary struggles have found an inexhaustible source of strength in the works of Mao Zedong.

Zapata then quoted Chairman Mao's statement that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

He said that U.S. imperialism supports extremely reactionary "gorilla" factions in various Latin American countries, helping them to seize power to oppress the people. The reactionary forces seem very powerful, but as soon as the people unite to fight them, imperialism and the reactionaries become frightened and change their puppets one after another. All this shows that U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries cannot withstand a blow from the people.

Zapata emphasized in his remarks that the people are invincible, and the outcome of a war depends on people, not so-called "advanced weapons."

Zapata said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China means that after seizing revolutionary power, it is still necessary to achieve victory in all aspects of ideology. This is a question of whether to carry the socialist revolution to the end, whether to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and at the same time, it is a question of whether to carry out world revolution.

Zapata also expressed to the reporters that he warmly welcomes and supports the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China.

Dr. Estela Chapa, president of the Mexico-China Friendship Association and a prominent women's social activist, told the reporters, "Not only the Chinese people, but all progressive people in the world must study the works of Mao Zedong, because Mao Zedong Thought is the most outstanding and brilliant lighthouse for the people of the world, a lighthouse that points the way forward for the people of all countries."

Chapa said that the peasant problem in Latin America is a very serious issue. Mao Zedong's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" are two works that have profound and extraordinary guiding significance for the peasant movement in Latin America. They help the people of various Latin American countries to solve their problems in theory and practice.

Chapa said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China is necessary and timely. Imperialists, revisionists, and all reactionaries are afraid of this revolution. They curse and slander this revolution precisely because this revolution targets them and will definitely overthrow them.

Ricardo Pozas, a famous anthropologist in Mexico, believes that Chairman Mao Zedong is a shining example for all true communists in the world. He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is revolutionary and truly Marxist-Leninist. Mao Zedong Thought is eternal."

In Mexico, more and more people are studying the works of Chairman Mao. Some teachers and progressive individuals have organized study groups for Chairman Mao's works. They believe that each of Mao Zedong's works is truth and a compass, truly Marxist-Leninist.

Juan Larrios Torrento, a Mexican economist who had just returned from China, told the reporters that he saw the high tide of studying the works of Mao Zedong in China, which deeply moved him. He said that the Chinese people who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought will be an invincible people in any situation. No force can stop the Chinese people from advancing with giant strides.

    墨西哥访华人士热烈支持中国无产阶级文化大革命
    毛泽东是世界革命人民最伟大导师和领路人  拉丁美洲人民从毛主席著作中汲取无穷力量
    据新华社墨西哥城电　访问过中国的墨西哥人士在中国共产党成立四十五周年的前夕向新华社记者发表谈话，以无比的热情赞颂毛主席和毛泽东思想。
    他们向记者热情地表示：毛主席是当代世界革命人民的最伟大的导师和领路人。光辉的毛泽东思想光芒万丈，始终引导着亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界的人民走上革命斗争的道路，摆脱枷锁、压迫和贫困，建立一个新的世界。
    墨西哥法学界著名人士、前众议员卡洛斯·萨帕塔在接见新华社记者时说，“毛泽东思想的伟大和正确不仅已由中国革命胜利的历史所证实，而且全世界人民正在进行的所有革命都将证明这一点。因此，毛泽东是中国人民的伟大导师和领路人，同时不愧为全世界人民的伟大导师和领路人。这是我们人类的骄傲。”他说，正在进行革命斗争的拉丁美洲人民在毛泽东著作中找到了取之不尽的力量。
    萨帕塔接着引述了毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断。
    他说，美帝国主义在拉丁美洲各国支持极端反动的“猩猩派”，帮助他们上台去统治和压迫人民，反动力量貌似十分强大，但是人民一起来同他们斗争，帝国主义和反动派就立即惶恐不安，非常害怕，接二连三地更换傀儡。所有这一切说明，美帝国主义和反动派都经不起人民的一击。
    萨帕塔在谈话中强调指出，人民是不可战胜的，战争的胜负取决于人，而不是所谓“先进武器”。
    萨帕塔说，中国正在进行的社会主义文化大革命意味着，在取得革命政权以后，还必须在意识形态的各方面取得胜利。这是一个是否要把社会主义革命进行到底、是否要巩固无产阶级专政的问题，同时也是一个是否要进行世界革命的问题。
    萨帕塔还向记者表示，他热烈欢迎和支持中国正在进行的文化大革命。
    墨西哥中国友好协会主席、著名妇女社会活动家埃斯特尔·查帕博士对记者说，“不仅中国人民，而且全世界所有进步的人士都必须学习毛泽东著作，因为毛泽东思想是全世界人民最杰出、最光辉的灯塔，是向各国人民指出前进的正确方向的灯塔。”
    查帕说，拉丁美洲的农民问题是一个极为严重的问题，毛泽东的《湖南农民运动考察报告》和《怎样分析农村阶级》两篇著作对拉丁美洲的农民运动具有深刻的、非凡的指导意义，它有助于拉丁美洲各国人民在理论和实践上解决他们的问题。
    查帕说，中国正在进行的社会主义文化大革命是必要的和及时的。帝国主义者、修正主义者和一切反动派都害怕这个革命，他们咒骂和诽谤这个革命，正是因为这个革命把他们当作目标，并且必定打倒他们。
    墨西哥著名人类学教授里卡多·波萨斯认为，毛泽东主席是全世界所有真正共产党人的光辉的榜样。他说，“毛泽东思想是革命的、真正马克思列宁主义的，毛泽东思想是永恒的。”
    在墨西哥有越来越多的人学习毛主席的著作，有些教师和一些进步人士组织了毛主席著作的学习小组。他们认为，毛泽东的每篇著作都是真理和指南针，是真正马克思列宁主义的。
    刚刚访华归来的墨西哥经济学家胡安·拉里奥斯·托伦蒂诺对记者说，他在中国看到了学习毛泽东著作的高潮，这使他深深感动。他说，掌握毛泽东思想的中国人民将是在任何情况下永远不可战胜的人民。没有任何力量能够阻止中国人民以巨人般的步伐前进。
