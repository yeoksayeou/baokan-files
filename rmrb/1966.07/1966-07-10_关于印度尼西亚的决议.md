The emergency conference of Asian and African writers, held in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, from June 27 to July 9, 1966, with the participation of more than 160 fighting writers from 53 countries and regions and five Asian and African international organizations, has closely followed with great concern and deep indignation the recent developments in Indonesia.

Since the fall of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo, the fascist military regime led by Generals Nasution and Suharto in Indonesia has launched the largest-scale white terror, the most barbaric massacre, and nationwide arrests and persecutions against patriotic and progressive masses, especially communists. Under the instigation of the CIA of American imperialism, these worst fascists have already massacred more than 300,000 people, including the best writers and other cultural workers. They have banned all revolutionary mass organizations, including the People's Cultural Institute, the vanguard of Indonesian revolutionary literature and art, and persecuted its members, as well as members of other progressive cultural organizations such as the Indonesian Cultural and Arts Institute and the National Cultural Institute. They have also banned all democratic and progressive parties, first and foremost the Indonesian Communist Party, the vanguard of the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism. They have trampled on the most basic foundations of democratic rights, burned all progressive and revolutionary works, including those by famous writers from Indonesia, Asia, Africa, and the world. No progressive publishing house or bookstore is allowed to operate. They have carried out "purges" not only in all state institutions, legislative bodies, commercial sectors, factories, plantations, schools, universities, and kindergartens but also in libraries and museums.

The Indonesian people, as well as the Asian, African, and world peoples, have never witnessed such savage, brutal, and ruthless atrocities in the past few decades. Only the most cruel acts of terror by medieval tyrants and sadists can be compared to this.

The Indonesian counter-revolutionaries and fascists led by Nasution and Suharto, using the "September 30th Movement" as a pretext, have continued their terror while completely seizing state power and establishing a fascist military regime.

Indonesia, which was once considered a powerful anti-imperialist country with a surging people's movement, a country that gave birth to the historic "Bandung Spirit," and a country that hosted many combative and anti-imperialist Asian and African international conferences and other international conferences, has now become a vast prison for progressives and democrats, soaked in blood and tears.

Indonesia, which was once considered a leading country in the struggle for Asian and African unity and the unity of anti-imperialist forces against the old forces of imperialism and reactionaries, has now become a country that continuously carries out the most vicious racist anti-Chinese and anti-Indonesian movements. China is the bastion of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world in their global struggle against imperialism. The fascist regime led by Nasution and Suharto has completely followed the U.S. global strategy of "containing" China, making China its number one enemy. This regime has betrayed the fundamental interests of the Indonesian people and the people of North Kalimantan and Malaya (including Singapore), not only stopping its opposition to the neo-colonialist product "Malaysia" but has also begun to collude with this neo-colonialist puppet. Meanwhile, the United States, the bastion of world imperialism, the source of invasion, domination, cultural decay, and bankrupt philosophy, the common number one enemy of the Indonesian people and all the people of the world, has become their master. They are completely dependent on this master and obey his every command.

The Indonesian reactionaries, in collusion with American imperialists and modern revisionists, are bringing back the bankrupt and corrupt writers, artists, and all other defenders of the dying philosophy and ideology of imperialism and its lackeys from the grave, organizing them into a so-called "revolutionary cultural front," giving them mass propaganda tools to spread poisonous reactionary ideas such as "art for art's sake" and "art without politics."

The reactionary atrocities, attacks, and crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries are not only directed against the Indonesian people but are essentially attacks on justice and the revolutionary cause of the Asian, African, and world peoples. Therefore, we must respond to this!

We, the fighting Asian and African writers, strongly condemn the savage attacks and massacres carried out by the Indonesian counter-revolutionaries. We Asian and African writers, in the struggle against imperialism and reactionary forces, uphold the principle of fighting and revolutionary unity, and reaffirm our determination to take up our pens and mobilize all the mass propaganda tools at our disposal to condemn the fascist military regime led by Generals Nasution and Suharto, demanding the immediate release of all detained individuals. We also condemn those so-called revolutionaries, the modern revisionists, who verbally support the struggle of Indonesian revolutionaries but in reality and action collude with imperialism and support the reactionary regime in Indonesia.

We fully understand that the current counter-revolutionary tide sweeping Indonesia is only temporary. The fascist atrocities in Indonesia do not indicate the strength of the reactionaries; on the contrary, they only prove their weakness and imminent doom. The evil clouds over the Indonesian archipelago will be swept away by the powerful new revolutionary tide of the Indonesian revolutionary forces. The patriotic revolutionary forces in Indonesia, including writers and artists, are reorganizing to wage a long-term armed struggle to smash the fascist military regime led by Nasution and Suharto.

The struggle of the Indonesian revolutionary forces will undoubtedly continue to grow stronger and turn the evil night into the final victory of dawn.

Let us Asian and African writers mobilize all our available forces to support the just struggle of the Indonesian revolutionaries.

Long live the progressive forces of Indonesia!

Down with the Nasution and Suharto fascist military regime!

### 关于印度尼西亚的决议

    关于印度尼西亚的决议
    一九六六年六月二十七日至七月九日在中华人民共和国首都北京召开的，有五十三个国家和地区以及五个亚非国际组织的一百六十多位战斗的作家参加的亚非作家紧急会议，以极大的关怀和深切的愤慨注视着印度尼西亚最近局势的发展。
    从希特勒、墨索里尼和东条倒台以来，在印度尼西亚由以纳苏蒂安将军和苏哈托将军为首的将领委员会的法西斯军事政权掀起了一个针对爱国进步群众，特别是共产党人的最大规模的白色恐怖，一个最野蛮的大屠杀运动和全国性的搜捕和迫害。在美帝国主义通过中央情报局的教唆下，这些最坏的法西斯分子已屠杀了三十多万人，包括最优秀的作家和其他文化工作者。他们取缔了所有革命的群众组织，包括人民文化协会这个印度尼西亚革命文艺的旗手，迫害它们的成员，以及其他象印度尼西亚文化艺术协会和民族文化协会等进步文化协会的会员，并且取缔了所有民主和进步的党派，首先是印度尼西亚人民反帝反封建斗争的先锋——印度尼西亚共产党。他们践踏了民主权利最起码的基础，烧毁了所有进步和革命的著作，印度尼西亚、亚洲、非洲和世界的著名作家的作品都一样。没有一个进步的出版社和书店被准许营业。他们不仅在所有国家机关、立法机构、商业部门、工厂、种植园、学校、大学和幼儿园进行了“清洗”，而且还在图书馆和博物馆进行了“清洗”。
    印度尼西亚人民、亚非人民和世界人民近几十年来从来没有见过这样野蛮、残暴和不顾一切的暴行，确实只有中世纪的暴君和虐待狂者的最残忍的恐怖行动才能够与之相比。
    以纳苏蒂安和苏哈托为首的印度尼西亚反革命分子和法西斯分子利用“九月三十日”事件作为借口，在继续进行他们的恐怖运动的同时，完全夺取了国家政权并建立了一个法西斯军事政权。
    印度尼西亚一向被认为是一个人民运动高涨的强大的反帝国家，一个诞生了具有历史意义的“万隆精神”的国家，一个召开过许多具有战斗性和反帝性质的亚非国际会议与其他国际会议的国家，现在已经变成了一个浸透了血和泪的进步与民主人士的大监狱。
    印度尼西亚一向被认为是在争取亚非团结和反帝力量团结，反对帝国主义和反动派的旧势力的斗争中，站在最前列的一个国家，现在却成了一个不断进行最恶毒的种族主义的排华和反华运动的国家。中国是亚非拉和世界人民在世界范围进行反帝斗争的堡垒。由纳苏蒂安和苏哈托为首的印度尼西亚法西斯政权已经完全依照美国“遏制”中国的全球战略，把中国当作它的头号敌人。这个政权出卖了印度尼西亚人民和北加里曼丹和马来亚（包括新加坡）人民的根本利益，不仅停止与新殖民主义的产物“马来西亚”相对抗，而且已经开始与这个新殖民主义傀儡勾结。同时，美国这个世界帝国主义的堡垒，侵略、统治、腐朽文化和破产了的哲学的根源，印度尼西亚人民和全世界人民的共同的头号公敌，已成了他们的主子。他们完全依赖这个主子并对他唯命是从。
    印度尼西亚反动派与美帝国主义者和现代修正主义者相勾结，正把破产了的、腐化了的作家、艺术家，和贩卖“普遍人性论”、“世界主义”、“虚无主义”、“实用主义”以及帝国主义及其走狗的垂死的哲学和意识形态的一切其它货色的辩护士从棺材里搬出来，把他们组织成一个所谓“革命的文化战线”，给予他们群众性的宣传工具，去散布“为艺术而艺术”和“不要政治的艺术”等等有毒的反动观念。
    印度尼西亚反动派反人民的暴行、攻击和罪行，不仅是针对印度尼西亚人民，实质上是对正义，对亚非和世界人民革命事业的攻击。因此，不能不对此作出回答！
    我们，战斗的亚非作家们，最强烈地谴责印度尼西亚反革命分子所进行的野蛮攻击和屠杀。我们亚非作家们在反对帝国主义和反动势力的斗争中高举战斗的和革命的团结原则，重申我们决心要拿起我们的笔杆并动员我们所掌握的全部群众性的宣传工具，来谴责以纳苏蒂安和苏哈托将军为首的法西斯军事政权，要求立即释放一切被囚禁的人士。我们还谴责那些所谓革命者，即现代修正主义者，他们口头上支持印度尼西亚革命者的斗争，但在实际上和行动上，他们却勾结帝国主义，支持印度尼西亚的反动政权。
    我们完全了解，现在席卷印度尼西亚的反革命逆流只是暂时性质的。印度尼西亚法西斯暴行并不表明反动派的强大；相反，只证明它们的虚弱和接近灭亡。印度尼西亚群岛上空的邪恶的乌云将被印度尼西亚革命力量强大的新革命高潮扫清。印度尼西亚革命的爱国的力量，包括作家和艺术家在内，正在重新组织起来，进行长期武装斗争来粉碎纳苏蒂安和苏哈托领导的法西斯军事政权。
    印度尼西亚革命力量所进行的斗争肯定将不断增强，并把邪恶的黑夜化为最后胜利的白昼。
    让我们亚非作家们动员我们力所能及的一切力量来支持印度尼西亚革命者的正义斗争。
    印度尼西亚的进步力量万岁！
    打倒纳苏蒂安和苏哈托法西斯军事政权！
