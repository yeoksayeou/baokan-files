Citizens of Beijing, Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet continue to rally, ready to respond to the motherland's call and rush to the frontlines of supporting Vietnam against the United States.

Workers of Daqing and local commune members firmly support Chairman Liu's statement and resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against the United States.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 26th, the people of the capital city and suburbs have continued to hold various activities in recent days, expressing their firm response to Chairman Liu's call, ready to bear the greatest national sacrifices, and support the Vietnamese people in achieving a complete victory in their war against the United States.

Cleaning worker Shi Chuanxiang said at a meeting of veteran workers in the cleaning team: Chairman Liu's statement represents the firm will of our hard-boned Chinese people. We workers have long made up our minds, just waiting for the Party's order.

Workers of the Beijing Crane Machinery Factory expressed their enthusiastic support and firm response to Chairman Liu's statement at reading sessions, pre-shift meetings, and small group meetings, vowing to be a strong backbone for the Vietnamese people. The workers pointed out that the Vietnamese people have supported us with their brave anti-American national liberation struggle, and we must also support the Vietnamese people with all sacrifices, which is our internationalist duty that we cannot shirk.

On the 24th, Wangshan County Jiaodao People's Commune in the suburbs held a rally of ten thousand people. The meeting passed a resolution expressing the determination of all commune members to respond to Chairman Liu's statement. The resolution stated that regardless of wind or rain, the Chinese people will always stand together with the Vietnamese brothers, fight together, and win together. The commune members of the Beijing Suburban Sino-Vietnam Friendship People's Commune, who have deep feelings for the Vietnamese people, have held meetings and written resolutions in recent days, expressing their most enthusiastic support for Chairman Liu's statement and their most resolute support for Chairman Ho Chi Minh's declaration. Many commune members said that once the motherland calls, they will step forward and fight alongside the Vietnamese people to strike the American aggressors.

Chairman Liu's statement has also sparked a great response in the capital's schools, hospitals, and cultural troupes. In Beijing Union Medical College, resolutions responding to Chairman Liu's statement and big-character posters supporting the Vietnamese people covered the walls. Medical staff expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, to be doctors like Norman Bethune, and to contribute everything they have to support Vietnam against the United States.

Chinese table tennis team coaches Wang Chuanyao, Li Rensu, and Zheng Zhongxian, who have visited Vietnam, said that to support the Vietnamese people in achieving a complete victory in their war against the United States, we Chinese sports workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are willing to pay the greatest price and bear the greatest sacrifices.

The performers and staff of the Eastern Song and Dance Troupe, who recently returned from a visit to Vietnam, held an anti-American aid Vietnam meeting on the 23rd. They said: We traveled through thirteen provinces in heroic Vietnam. Whether in artillery positions, factory workshops, mountain cooperative fields, or bamboo groves, we saw the great power of people's war. The Vietnamese people are all eager to go to the front lines and fight the enemy. Such a brave and tenacious people are invincible.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 26th, the broad masses of workers, peasants, PLA soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet have continued to hold rallies in recent days. People at the rallies firmly expressed that the Chinese people have made all preparations to support the Vietnamese people in achieving a complete victory in their war against the United States, and will not hesitate to contribute all their strength. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in various places expressed their enthusiastic support for Chairman Liu's statement and firmly supported Chairman Ho's fighting declaration.

In the coastal defense frontline city of Xiamen, the broad masses of militia and people have held meetings in recent days, expressing their high fighting spirit: We must strive for production, actively train, and be ready to respond to the motherland's call at any time to support the Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation. Yan Jianlin, the militia squad leader of Xiamen Shipyard and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in Fujian Province, said: The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, the least afraid of sacrifice, and the least afraid of imperialism. We have made full preparations and are ready to give the American imperialists a crushing blow at any time. On the evening of the 22nd, five thousand militia members and faculty and staff of Xiamen University also held a rally in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation.

In recent days, factories, people's communes, schools, institutions, and shops in various places in Zhejiang Province have held rallies or sent letters and telegrams of support, expressing their determination to support the Vietnamese people's just struggle for national liberation with practical actions. Employees of seven units, including the Xinhua Bookstore Hangzhou Branch, Hangzhou Foreign Language Bookstore, and Hangzhou Children's Bookstore, expressed their determination to fight alongside their Vietnamese brothers and win together.

In recent days, many units in Hefei City, Anhui Province, have continued to hold rallies. At a rally, Yi Lizhou of the Hefei City Department Store Sanxiao Branch pointed out that the American imperialists' unrestrained "escalation" of the Vietnam War is nothing but digging their own graves. The iron fists of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of the world will smash them to pieces.

In recent days, Shandong Province has seen a new high tide of supporting Vietnam against the United States, from cities to rural areas. Zhang Qifa, a model worker from the Zaozhuang Coal Mine, and Ma Shudu, a national agricultural labor model and party branch secretary of Xueyao Brigade, Taian County, Daling Commune, pointed out at rallies that the Geneva Agreement was torn up by the American imperialists, and the war boundaries were broken by the Americans. We warn the American aggressors not to miscalculate. The American imperialists' crazy "escalation" of aggressive war will surely receive the punishment they deserve.

At a rally of advanced units and activists studying Chairman Mao's works in Hebei Province, Li Xuelin, the militia company commander of Baozhen Automobile Repair Factory, said: Chairman Mao has long told us: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail more, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." The American imperialists cannot save themselves from their doomed fate.

The militia members of Baolige in Balin Right Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, heard Chairman Liu's statement on the radio, and everyone's spirits were boosted, and their fighting spirit was high. They said that we grassland militia members, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have made all preparations. As soon as the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao give the order, we will join the Vietnamese people to jointly strike the American aggressors.

In recent days, the million emancipated serfs of Tibet have expressed their determination to be a strong backbone for the Vietnamese people, unanimously expressing their determination to carry forward the spirit of high proletarian internationalism and fully support the Vietnamese class brothers' just struggle for national liberation. The emancipated serfs of Laru Township on the outskirts of Lhasa gathered in the township cultural room after hearing Chairman Liu's statement, and the atmosphere was heated. Poor farmer Suolang angrily said: "The American imperialists are the ringleaders of all class enemies. They are like wolves that will never change their nature of eating people. But in the face of the seven hundred million people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the American imperialists are just a jumping flea. We million emancipated serfs will resolutely stand with all ethnic groups in the country, ready to fight alongside our Vietnamese brothers to strike the American aggressors."

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 26th, the workers, families, and local commune members of Daqing Oilfield, nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought, solemnly gathered on the 24th and made a solemn vow: to most resolutely and enthusiastically support Chairman Liu's statement, firmly support the Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation, and continue until all American aggressors invading Vietnam are completely, thoroughly, and utterly eliminated. The responsible comrades of Daqing Oilfield, worker representatives, family representatives, and militia representatives were all indignant and spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that the Daqing people listen to the Party the most, listen to Chairman Mao the most. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and take all the most effective measures to support the Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation.
