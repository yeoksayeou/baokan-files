The State Sports Commission recently issued a notice requiring all levels of sports organizations across the country to further implement Chairman Mao's instructions and promote mass swimming activities. The notice states: Chairman Mao's instructions are our guiding principles, which we must study earnestly, propagate enthusiastically, and execute faithfully. We must forever follow Chairman Mao into the stormy seas and be revolutionaries of the proletariat for life.

Our great leader, Chairman Mao, recently braved the winds and waves to swim across the Yangtze River. The news brought joy to the entire nation, and sports comrades were particularly elated and moved. Chairman Mao is so healthy and full of vigor! This is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and for all revolutionary people around the world!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Swimming is a form of struggle against nature, and you should go to the great rivers and seas to train." "Swimming in rivers has currents, which can train one's will and courage!" Chairman Mao instructs: "There are so many rivers in the country; can we all use them for swimming? With a population of 600 million, can we have 300 million people all swim?" During this swim across the Yangtze, Chairman Mao asked: "Can one in three people swim?" and expressed satisfaction that the youth of Wuhan could achieve this. Chairman Mao's words are our guiding principles, which we must study earnestly, propagate enthusiastically, and execute faithfully.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's people's war thoughts and his instructions on sports and swimming, and inspired by the revolutionary situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the support for Vietnam against American aggression, swimming activities this summer have been more vigorous and solid than ever before. All levels of sports commissions must seize the current favorable situation, study and implement Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, and vigorously propagate Chairman Mao's great thoughts and practices. This will become a great driving force for the broader and deeper development of mass swimming activities.

All levels of sports commissions must, in promoting swimming activities, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and do a good job in mobilization and organization. They must fully implement the various requirements of the "Opinions on Swimming Work in 1966" issued jointly by nine units on April 9. They must educate the broad masses of people and youth on proletarian worldview, socialist revolution, and class struggle, and on patriotism, internationalism, and the people's war thoughts. They must cultivate in people a fearless revolutionary spirit to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory. They must train people to have a revolutionary will, courage, and strong bodies to struggle against nature and against class enemies.

All sports workers and athletes must strive to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they must actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and throw themselves into the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. They must forever follow Chairman Mao into the stormy seas and be revolutionaries of the proletariat for life!

    新华社二十八日讯　国家体委最近发出通知，要求全国各级体育组织进一步贯彻毛主席的指示，开展群众性游泳活动。通知指出：毛主席的指示是我们的指导方向，必须认真学习、热情宣传、忠实执行，永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进，作一辈子无产阶级革命派。通知全文如下：
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，最近又一次乘风破浪，畅游长江。喜讯传来，全国振奋，体育战线上的同志们更是欢欣鼓舞，激动万分。毛主席这样健康，精力这样充沛，这是全中国人民的最大幸福！是全世界革命人民的最大幸福！
    毛主席教导我们：“游泳是同大自然作斗争的一种运动，你们应该到大江大海去锻炼。”“在江河游泳，有逆流，可以锻炼意志和勇敢！”毛主席指示：“全国的江河这样多，能不能都利用起来游泳呢？全国六亿人口，能不能有三亿人口都来游泳呢？”在这次畅游长江时，毛主席又问：“三个人当中有一个人会游泳吗？”并对武汉市青少年能作到这点表示满意。毛主席的话，是我们的指导方向，我们必须认真学习，热情宣传，忠实执行。
    在毛主席的人民战争思想和毛主席对体育运动以及游泳工作指示的指导下，在无产阶级文化大革命和援越抗美的革命形势鼓舞下，今年入夏以来，各地游泳活动开展得比往年更有声势，更加蓬蓬勃勃、扎扎实实。各级体委必须抓紧当前的有利形势，认真研究和进一步贯彻毛主席的有关指示，大力宣传毛主席的伟大思想和伟大实践，使之成为鼓舞和推动群众性游泳活动更广泛、更深入开展的巨大动力。
    各级体委一定要在开展游泳活动中，活学活用毛主席著作，认真作好动员工作和组织工作。切实贯彻今年四月九单位联合发出的《关于一九六六年游泳工作的意见》中的各项要求。向广大人民和青少年进行无产阶级世界观、社会主义革命和阶级斗争的教育，进行爱国主义、国际主义和人民战争思想的教育。培养人们排除万难，去争取胜利的大无畏革命精神。锻炼人们经得起大风大浪的革命意志、勇敢精神和坚强体魄，去同大自然搏斗，同阶级敌人搏斗。
    广大体育工作者和运动员一定要努力读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，积极投入到阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中去，永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪中前进，作一辈子无产阶级革命派！
