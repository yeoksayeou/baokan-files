Tanzanian representative Hassan delivered a speech at the emergency meeting of the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference held today. He strongly condemned the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism in Vietnam and the conspiracies of those who pretend to oppose imperialism but are actually fake revolutionaries. He said, "We must resolutely fight against imperialism. If we do not defeat it, it will defeat us. There is no third way."

Hassan said that at present, Vietnam is the center of the world's anti-imperialist struggle. Tanzanian writers and poets regard the struggle of the Vietnamese people as their own struggle. No matter what kind of bombs or conspiracies the American imperialists use, they will ultimately fail, and the Vietnamese people will win.

He also praised the Cultural Revolution being carried out by the Chinese people, saying, "We have seen with our own eyes the importance of the profound and thorough revolutionization of the working people."

He said, "Our literature must become a weapon for the people to fight against imperialism and colonialism. If we do not make it a weapon for the struggle, then imperialism and colonialism will seize this position. Our pens must be the guns with which we wage a long-term struggle against imperialism led by the United States."

    坦桑尼亚代表哈桑尼的发言
    新华社二日讯　坦桑尼亚代表哈桑尼在亚非作家紧急会议今天举行的全体会议上，强烈谴责美帝国主义在越南犯下的滔天罪行以及那些假装反对帝国主义的假革命者的阴谋活动。他说，对帝国主义就要进行坚决的斗争，如果我们不打垮它，它们就要打垮我们，第三条道路是没有的。哈桑尼说，目前，越南是世界反帝斗争的中心。坦桑尼亚作家和诗人把越南人民的斗争看作是自己的斗争。无论美帝国主义者使用什么样的炸弹和阴谋，他们最终必败，越南人民必胜。
    他还赞扬中国人民进行的文化大革命，他说，我们亲眼看到了劳动人民深刻和彻底革命化的重要性。
    他说，我们的文学要成为人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争的武器。如果我们不把它当作斗争的武器，那么帝国主义和殖民主义就会夺取这一阵地。我们的笔杆应当是我们向以美国为首的帝国主义进行长期斗争的枪杆。
