	Beijing industrial labor models, worker amateur literary and artistic creation activists, and Beijing music and dance workers held a rally to enthusiastically support the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers and resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, on the 3rd, Beijing industrial labor models and worker amateur literary and artistic creation activists held a rally in the afternoon to express their most sincere congratulations and enthusiastic support for the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers currently being held in Beijing. They pointed out that this conference, under the banner of opposing U.S. imperialism and opposing new and old colonialism, once again sounded the call for the unity and struggle of the 2 billion Asian and African peoples. This is another heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and a great encouragement to the Asian and African peoples and revolutionary peoples around the world who are fighting.

	The attendees were all very happy to see that in the past few days, many Asian and African writers, with high revolutionary enthusiasm, have enthusiastically praised our great leader Chairman Mao, and have unlimited love and faith in the great Mao Zedong Thought. They believe that this situation fully shows that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has deeply entered the hearts of the Asian and African peoples and people around the world, and Chairman Mao has become the great leader, teacher, and standard-bearer of the Asian and African peoples and people around the world. The Beijing industrial labor models and worker amateur creation activists present unanimously expressed that the Chinese working class must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is being widely and deeply developed in our country to the end, and together with the Asian and African peoples and people around the world, make greater contributions to the world's anti-imperialist revolutionary cause.

	At the meeting, everyone also enthusiastically responded to the call of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, expressing their determination to better support the Vietnamese people's great struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation with practical actions.

	Zhang Baifa, the leader of the Youth Shock Brigade of the Beijing Third Construction Engineering Company and a national industrial labor model, said excitedly at the meeting, "This conference is a conference of unity and struggle against imperialism by the Asian and African peoples. It is a fighting conference and a great demonstration against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionists to sabotage this conference has met with a shameful failure."

	Zhang Baifa said, "The Chinese working class and people, who are advancing under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are now vigorously carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sweeping away all ghosts and monsters. We will also, together with the Asian and African peoples and people around the world, oppose imperialism and new and old colonialism and completely eliminate them from the earth."

	"Mao Zedong Number" locomotive driver, national industrial labor model Cai Lianxing emphasized that the shameful behavior of Soviet revisionists in splitting the Asian and African writers' movement and sabotaging the Asian and African national liberation struggle has once again exposed their ugly faces. We fully support the just action of the Asian and African Writers' Permanent Bureau to expel Soviet revisionists from the Asian and African writers' ranks. He said, "The Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers held in Beijing this time fully conforms to the genuine interests and wishes of the 2 billion Asian and African peoples, and therefore has won the unanimous support and praise of the Asian and African peoples and revolutionary peoples around the world."

	Cai Lianxing said, "Our locomotive has been named after Chairman Mao's glorious name for twenty years this year. In these twenty years, every worker who has worked on the 'Mao Zedong Number' locomotive has felt as if they were working by Chairman Mao's side every day, and there has never been an accident. This is because Mao Zedong Thought has armed our minds. He said, "We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution thoroughly, and resolutely support the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of all countries."

	Chen Fa, a 66-year-old worker engineer from the Longshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory and a national industrial labor model, said, "The successful convening of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers once again shows that the 2 billion Asian and African peoples all demand anti-imperialist revolution. This is an irresistible historical trend that no one can stop, and it is also a vivid manifestation of the great Mao Zedong Thought deeply rooted in the hearts of the Asian and African peoples and people around the world."

	Worker engineer and national industrial labor model Ni Zhifu, Beijing Post Office "Five Good" worker and Beijing activist in studying Chairman Mao's works Luo Guixia, worker Li Xu from the Beijing People's Printing Plant, and others also spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that the successful convening of this conference and the shameful failure of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism once again proved Chairman Mao's wise judgment: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail worse, until they are utterly destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic."

	They also pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most active Marxism-Leninism, and the beacon of the world's revolutionary peoples. With this most powerful ideological weapon, we have nothing to fear.

	At the meeting, Longshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory worker amateur creation activist Guo Ruokai and Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill worker amateur creation activist Fan Yiben expressed their enthusiastic support for the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers with passionate emotions. Guo Ruokai wrote in a poem titled "To Asian and African Writers": "Revolutionary warriors on the anti-imperialist front, Chinese workers, 700 million Chinese people, we vow to be your strong rear guard! We will have Mao Zedong Thought on our heads, a revolutionary heart in our chests, one hand holding tools, and the other holding a pen, sweeping away all ghosts and monsters, eliminating imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary forces, and making the world belong to the people of the world forever."

	According to Xinhua News Agency, on the 3rd, Beijing music and dance workers held a rally to express their enthusiastic congratulations to the ongoing Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. They decided to contribute their greatest efforts to the struggle against U.S.-led imperialism and new and old colonialism and to the development of national cultures in various Asian and African countries, together with the Asian and African writers.

	All attendees expressed their enthusiastic response to the call of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers and their determination to fully support the Vietnamese people's great struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

	At the meeting, Zhong Runliang, who plays the female lead character Honghua in the revolutionary modern ballet "Red Detachment of Women," male actor Sun Xuejing, and orchestra conductor Bian Zushan said that the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionists to sabotage the Asian and African writers' movement has met with a shameful failure, and the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers will achieve even greater glory.

	They also said that the Asian and African writers attending this conference have brought the deep affection of the Asian and African peoples for the Chinese people, their heartfelt admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao, and their boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought. This is a great encouragement and inspiration to us. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most active Marxism-Leninism, and the most powerful weapon to defeat all enemies. We have unlimited faith and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought. It is the highest directive for us to do all our work. We are determined to study Chairman Mao's books for life, always listen to Chairman Mao's words, and vow to be successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, never to be tools for spreading bourgeois culture. We will dedicate our lives to the revolution and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the people of the world for life.

	Meng Dege, a Mongolian dancer from the Eastern Song and Dance Troupe, who recently returned from a visit to Vietnam to perform against U.S. aggression, angrily denounced the heinous crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam at the meeting.

	Shi Xiucun, a solo singer from the Central Song and Dance Troupe who had just returned from Guangdong countryside, and musician Zhang Ying said in their speeches that revolutionary literary and artistic workers must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, deeply integrate with them, learn from them, and strive to reform bourgeois ideology and establish a proletarian worldview. Only in this way can literature and art, as Chairman Mao instructed, become a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and defeating the enemy, as an integral part of the entire revolutionary machine. We Chinese literary and artistic workers are willing to join the Asian and African writers to take up this weapon of literature and art and give a heavy blow to our common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

	They said that now our country is carrying out a magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Every literary and artistic warrior is arming his mind with Mao Zedong Thought and engaging in a life-and-death class struggle with all ghosts and monsters. Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in our hearts, Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We will pass down the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation and, together with the Asian and African peoples, carry out the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and revisionism to the end.

	Aytula, a Uyghur female dancer from the Eastern Song and Dance Troupe, who had performed in several Asian and African countries with the troupe, said, "We will perform our favorite dance numbers for our comrades from the front lines of the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle in Asia and Africa to express our Chinese people's fighting friendship with the Asian and African peoples."

	Qimuge, a Mongolian "Five Good" performer from the Grassland Song and Dance Troupe, and Wunengji, a "Five Good" performer from the Daur ethnic group, who specially came to Beijing to perform for the Asian and African writers attending the Emergency Conference, said, "We will join the Asian and African writers to resolutely oppose U.S.-led imperialism and new and old colonialism."

	They also expressed that in the future, they will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, always be red propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, and support the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples and people around the world with their practical actions, support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and support this Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers with great historical significance.

    北京市第三建筑工程公司青年突击队队长、全国工业劳动模范张百发在发言中兴奋地说，这次会议是亚非人民团结反帝的会，战斗的会，是对美帝国主义及其走狗的大示威。美帝国主义和苏联分裂主义者企图破坏这次会议的阴谋，遭到了可耻的失败。

    蔡连兴说，我们的机车用毛主席的光辉名字命名到今年整整二十年了。这二十年中，我们每一个在“毛泽东号”机车上工作过的工人，都好象每天是在毛主席身边工作一样，没有发生过一次事故，这是因为用毛泽东思想武装了我们大家的头脑。他说，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命搞彻底，坚决支持各国人民的反帝斗争。
    长辛店机车车辆厂六十六岁的工人工程师、全国工业劳动模范陈发强调说，这次亚非作家紧急会议的胜利召开，再一次表明二十亿亚非人民都要求反帝革命，这是任何人阻挡不了的历史潮流，也是伟大的毛泽东思想已经在亚非人民和世界人民中深入人心的生动表现。
    工人工程师、全国工业劳动模范倪志福，北京市邮局“五好”工人、北京市学习毛主席著作积极分子罗桂华，北京市人民印刷厂工人李序等都在会上发言，他们指出，这次会议的胜利召开和美帝国主义、苏联修正主义的可耻失败，再一次证明了毛主席的英明论断：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    他们还指出，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是世界革命人民的灯塔。我们有了这个最强大的思想武器，就什么也不怕。

    在革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》中扮演女主角琼花的钟润良，男演员孙学敬，以及乐队指挥卞祖善等发言时说，美帝国主义和苏联修正主义者企图破坏亚非作家运动的阴谋已经遭到可耻的失败，亚非作家紧急会议将获得更加辉煌的成就。
    他们还说，参加这次会议的亚非作家代表们，带来了亚非人民对中国人民的深情厚谊，带来了亚非人民对我们伟大领袖毛主席的衷心爱戴和对毛泽东思想的无比热爱，这对我们是极大的鼓舞和鞭策。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是战胜一切敌人的最强大武器。我们对毛泽东思想无限信仰，无限崇拜。它是我们从事一切工作的最高指示。我们决心读一辈子毛主席的书，永远听毛主席的话，誓作无产阶级革命事业的接班人，决不作传播资产阶级文化的工具。我们要干一辈子革命，为工农兵和为世界人民服务一辈子。
    不久前从反美斗争最前线的越南访问演出归来的东方歌舞团蒙古族舞蹈女演员莫德格玛，在座谈中愤怒地控诉了美国强盗在越南犯下的滔天罪行。
    刚从广东农村回来的中央歌舞团独唱演员史秀云、音乐工作者张鹰在发言中说，革命的文艺工作者要为工农兵服务，必须深入实际，同工农兵相结合，向他们学习，努力改造资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级世界观。只有这样，才能象毛主席指示的那样，使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器。我们中国文艺工作者愿同亚非作家一道，拿起文艺这个武器，狠狠地打击我们共同的敌人美帝国主义。
    他们说，现在我国正在进行一场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，我们每一个文艺战士正在用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，同一切牛鬼蛇神展开你死我活的激烈的阶级搏斗。毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，我们要把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗世世代代传下去，要同亚非人民一起，把反帝、反殖、反修的斗争进行到底。
    东方歌舞团维吾尔族女演员阿依吐拉曾经随团到过好几个亚非国家访问演出，她说，我们要为来自亚非反帝反殖斗争最前线的战友们演自己最喜爱的舞蹈节目，来表达我们中国人民对亚非人民的战斗友谊。
