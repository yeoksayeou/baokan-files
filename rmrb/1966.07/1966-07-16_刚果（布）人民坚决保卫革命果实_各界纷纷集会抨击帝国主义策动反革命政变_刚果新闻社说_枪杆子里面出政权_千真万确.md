The Congolese people resolutely defend the fruits of the revolution. Various sectors hold meetings to denounce imperialist-backed counter-revolutionary coup.

The Congolese News Agency says, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," which is absolutely true.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Brazzaville, July 13: The Congolese public and opinion strongly condemn the imperialist-backed counter-revolutionary coup on June 27 in Congo (Brazzaville) and express their determination to resolutely defend the fruits of the revolution.

"Defend the revolution," "Do not let the counter-revolution succeed," these have become the central slogans of the Congolese people at present.

In recent days, the various branches of the ruling party, the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville), the youth organization of the National Revolutionary Movement, and other people's organizations have held meetings to angrily denounce imperialist plots and express their resolute support for the government.

On the 12th, the leader of the Congolese Women's Revolutionary Union met with the leaders of the ruling party's Political Bureau and firmly expressed their determination to fight against conspiratorial activities. They demanded that women receive military and political training. They said, "Any military training without political education is like having no direction."

In a commentary, the Congolese News Agency, while reviewing recent events, emphasized: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. This statement is absolutely true. Therefore, the people, in order to maintain their political power, must have a people's army that is connected with the masses and protects the masses."

The ruling party's organ, the *Combat Newspaper*, in its recent issue, stated in a commentary: "The only urgent task is to consolidate the revolutionary political power." The *Independent Weekly* on July 9 emphasized in a commentary that recent plots show that it is impossible to build an independent country relying on the old state machinery left by imperialists and old and new colonialists.

　　刚果（布）人民坚决保卫革命果实
　　各界纷纷集会抨击帝国主义策动反革命政变
　　刚果新闻社说“枪杆子里面出政权”千真万确
    据新华社布拉柴维尔十三日电　刚果（布）公众和舆论强烈谴责帝国主义六月二十七日在刚果（布）策动反革命政变，并且表示要坚决保卫革命果实。
      “保卫革命”、“不准反革命得逞”，这已经成为目前刚果（布）人民的中心口号。
    最近几天，执政党刚果（布）全国革命运动的各支部，全国革命运动青年组织和其它人民团体纷纷举行集会，愤怒谴责帝国主义的阴谋，并且表示坚决支持政府。
    刚果（布）妇女革命联盟领导人十二日会见了执政党政治局领导人，坚决表示了要同阴谋活动作斗争的愿望。她们要求妇女接受军事训练和政治训练。她们说，任何军事训练要是没有政治教育，那就等于没有方向。
    刚果新闻社在一篇社论中回顾最近发生的事件时强调指出：“枪杆子里面出政权。这句话是千真万确的。因此，人民为了保持自己的政权，必须拥有联系群众和保卫群众的人民军队。”
    执政党机关报《战斗报》在最近一期发表社论说：“唯一紧急的任务，就是巩固革命的政权。”《独立周刊》七月九日在社论中强调指出，最近的阴谋表明，人们不可能依靠帝国主义者和新老殖民主义者遗留下来的旧的国家机器来进行独立国家的建设。
