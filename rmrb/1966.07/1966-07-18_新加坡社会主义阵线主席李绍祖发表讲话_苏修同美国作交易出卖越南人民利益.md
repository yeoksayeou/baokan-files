New Singapore Socialist Front Chairman Li Shaozu Speaks: The Soviet Revisionists Are Making Deals with the United States, Selling Out the Interests of the Vietnamese People

BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- According to a report by the Singapore Socialist Front's organ, the "Masses' Daily," on July 8, Singapore Socialist Front Chairman Li Shaozu condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for making backroom deals with the United States, selling out the interests of the Vietnamese people.

Li Shaozu recently, while addressing the Perak Regional Committee of the Malayan Labor Party and the Malayan People's Party, said, "The Soviet revisionist leaders are assisting the U.S. imperialists in invading the peoples of Southeast Asia. Because of the understanding reached between the Soviet Union and U.S. imperialism, the U.S. imperialists are able to transfer the troops currently stationed in Europe to Vietnam." He said, "The Soviet Union, despite saying many nice words, has not truly aided the Vietnamese people."

He said, "The people of Malaya, including Singapore, fully support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against American aggression and for national liberation." He said, "The most effective and best support and solidarity we can give to the Vietnamese people is to intensify and strengthen the struggle against U.S. and British imperialism in Malaya in a fruitful manner."

He supported the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and pointed out that this is the only way to resolve the Vietnam War.

　　新加坡社会主义阵线主席李绍祖发表讲话
　　苏修同美国作交易出卖越南人民利益
    新华社十七日讯　新加坡消息：据新加坡社会主义阵线机关报《大众报》八日报道：新加坡社会主义阵线主席李绍祖谴责苏联修正主义领导集团同美国进行幕后交易，出卖越南人民的利益。
    李绍祖最近在马来亚劳工党和马来亚人民党霹雳地区委员会发表讲话时说，苏联修正主义领导人“在帮助美帝国主义者侵略东南亚人民。由于苏联同美帝国主义者达成了谅解，使得美帝国主义者能够把目前驻在欧洲的军队调往越南。”他说，“苏联尽管说了许多漂亮话，却没有真正帮助越南人民。”
    他说：“包括新加坡在内的马来亚人民，完全支持越南人民反对美国侵略、争取民族解放的正义斗争。”他说，“我们能够给予越南人民的最有效和最好的声援和支持就是，我们要加紧和加强以及卓有成效地在马来亚进行反对美、英帝国主义的斗争。”
    他支持越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，并指出，这是解决越南战争的唯一途径。
