	Vietnamese People's Daily Warmly Congratulates the 45th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China
	China's Brilliant Achievements Prove the Wisdom of Chairman Mao's Leadership

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 1 — Various newspapers in Vietnam published editorials today to warmly congratulate the 45th anniversary of the founding of the great Communist Party of China.

	The editorial of the People's Daily said that the founding of the Communist Party of China opened up a path to victory for the liberation of the Chinese working class and people. Especially since the Zunyi Conference, the Chinese revolution has steadily advanced and achieved brilliant victories.

	The editorial said that the entire history of the Communist Party of China is a history of heroic struggle and enduring numerous severe tests. The editorial detailed the history of the victory of the Chinese revolution and the great achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The editorial said that the brilliant victories and achievements of the Chinese revolution eloquently prove the wisdom of the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese working class and people. At the same time, these victories and achievements also eloquently prove the boundless vitality of Marxism-Leninism, because this is the brilliant result of the close combination of Marxism-Leninism theory with Chinese revolutionary practice.

	The editorial said that the Communist Party of China not only led and organized all the victories of the Chinese revolution but also made extremely important contributions to the world communist and workers' movement, national liberation movement, and the movement for peace and democracy. The editorial said that the victory of the Chinese revolution has shifted the balance of power between the two major camps in the world to the side of the socialist camp and has greatly promoted the development of the forces fighting for peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism on five continents.

	The editorial said that in the struggle of the world's people against the aggressive and war policies of imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism, China is a resolute and courageous fighter. China not only fights to the end to smash all the conspiracies and actions of U.S. imperialism against China but also consistently spares no effort to support the struggles of other peoples against U.S. imperialist aggressors. Especially for the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, China's support is indeed enormous.

	The editorial said that on the international stage, the People's Republic of China holds an extremely important position. Today, without China's participation, major issues in the world cannot be resolved.

	The editorial said that for a long time, the Vietnamese people and the Chinese people have had deep affection. After the birth of the vanguard parties of the working classes of the two countries, thoroughly understanding the spirit of proletarian internationalism, this affection has become even deeper and closer.

	After describing the great assistance of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people to Vietnam, the editorial said that at present, in the sacred cause of resisting America and saving the nation, China has consistently spared no effort to support and help the Vietnamese people, and at the same time, wholeheartedly and according to plan, transports aid materials from the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries to Vietnam.

	The editorial said that the Vietnamese people clearly know the close comradely and brotherly relationship between the two parties and the two peoples of Vietnam and China. No matter how much the sea dries up and the stones crumble, Vietnam's feelings for China will always be deep and close. We regard China's victories as our own victories. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by beloved Chairman Hu, we are united and determined to spare no effort to support the Chinese revolution, support the cause of socialist construction in China, support China's struggle to liberate Taiwan, and support China in smashing all provocations and aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism against China.

	The editorial expressed that the Vietnamese people are determined to advance bravely in the sacred cause of resisting America and saving the nation, which has great international significance, to achieve ever-greater victories and ultimately achieve complete victory.

	The editorial of the People's Army Daily said that the great victory of the Chinese revolution is the victory of the correct line of creatively applying Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese revolutionary practice led by Comrade Mao Zedong. The precious experience of the Chinese revolution has enriched the theoretical treasure house of Marxism-Leninism and made a great contribution to the world revolutionary movement. The editorial said that throughout the revolutionary struggle, the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people to resolutely oppose imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism and actively supported the world revolutionary movement, especially actively supported the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

	The editorial of the Labor Daily said that the Communist Party of China, together with Marxist-Leninist parties around the world, has made great contributions to defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism and defending the revolutionary cause of the international working class. The Vietnamese People's Daily, People's Army Daily, Labor Daily, New Era Daily, and Hanoi Capital Daily have also opened special columns in recent days to publish articles, warmly congratulating the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, and warmly congratulating the great achievements of the Chinese people in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.
