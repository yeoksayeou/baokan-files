    关于刚果（利）的决议
    考虑到五年多来美帝国主义伙同比利时帝国主义践踏刚果人民的主权，并无耻地对刚果共和国进行武装侵略；
    考虑到美帝国主义为了继续它的剥削和安抚人民，在广大群众当中扩大了它的思想宣传活动，企图使他们陷于混乱；
    考虑到刚果人民的武装斗争是对正在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的亚洲和非洲人民的解放事业的积极贡献；
    自一九六六年六月二十七日至七月九日在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议，在听取了关于刚果的报告之后，
    坚决支持刚果人民的武装斗争，承认全国解放委员会是刚果人民和民族的唯一代表；
    谴责蒙博托反动政权和他的所谓民族复兴政府对刚果爱国者进行的卑鄙无耻的屠杀，这个所谓的民族复兴政府的建立只是为了欺骗国际舆论，以便使帝国主义的掠夺和剥削制度长期维持下去；
    谴责镇压人民的在刚果的外国军队和雇佣军以及蒙博托军国主义；
    宣告，刚果人民所进行的斗争是解放刚果的唯一正常的道路。
