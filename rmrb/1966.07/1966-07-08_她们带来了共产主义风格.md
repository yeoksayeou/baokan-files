Lin Ren Su, from Linzhuang, joined the Party shortly before the earthquake. On the day of the earthquake, after being rescued, she immediately went to rescue others. After working all day, she stayed up all night to build a fire, delivering water and medicine to each household. It was not until the next morning that she returned home. When she saw a copy of "Qu Gong Yi Shan" (The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains), her eyes lit up, and her fatigue disappeared instantly. She thought of the cultural room, which still had many of Chairman Mao's works, and immediately rushed there. The walls of the cultural room had not completely collapsed, making it dangerous to enter and retrieve the books. However, she thought that Chairman Mao's books were needed to inspire the community members to fight against natural disasters, so she bravely retrieved over forty single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works.

Chairman Mao's works inspired and guided the community members to fight against natural disasters. This year's wheat harvest was very successful. On the morning of June 10th, Lin Ren Su organized the female militia to go to the fields to pick up wheat stalks. Around noon, someone suddenly said, "Hey, we've almost picked through all the wheat fields in our brigade, but why are there still so many wheat stalks?" This remark alerted everyone. Lin Ren Su said, "Our fields border Sheluokou Village. Could we have picked the wrong ones?" After checking, it turned out that the field indeed belonged to Sheluokou Village. At this point, everyone started to argue, "What should we do now? If they find out, will they say we stole it?" Someone even suggested, "Let's just secretly throw the wheat back into Sheluokou Village's fields."

Lin Ren Su opposed this idea. She said, "We study Chairman Mao's works every day. Now, we should handle this matter according to Chairman Mao's instructions." Finally, it was decided that Lin Ren Su would lead three female militia members to use the lunch break to carry eight bundles of wheat to Sheluokou Village.

Upon arrival, they found the village cadre and Lin Ren Su explained the whole situation in detail. While handing over the wheat, she also solemnly presented two copies of Chairman Mao's works to the chairman of the Poor Peasants' Association. The chairman, moved, shook Lin Ren Su's hand and said, "You are truly Chairman Mao's good militia members. Not only did you return the wheat, but more importantly, you brought us Mao Zedong Thought and the communist style."

That evening, Linzhuang also became lively. The Party branch of Sheluokou Village sent a representative with drums and gongs to thank the Linzhuang community members. The people of Linzhuang lined the streets to welcome them. The representative from Sheluokou Village read a letter of thanks to the Party branch, Poor Peasants' Association, and the broad masses of Linzhuang. They then presented a precious gift—twelve copies of Chairman Mao's works. Everyone said, "We poor and lower-middle peasants cannot be without Chairman Mao's works for even a moment!"

    她们带来了共产主义风格
    印强
    林庄的林仁素是地震前不久入党的。地震那天，她被人救起以后，立刻就去救别人。白天累了一天，夜里又烧了一夜火，把水和药送到各户。直到第二天清晨，才回到家里，当她看到一本《愚公移山》时，眼中闪出了光芒，疲劳立刻消失了。她联想到文化室还有很多毛主席著作，便马上跑到那里去。文化室的墙还没有完全倒，进去取书是很危险的。但是，她想到现在正需要毛主席的书来鼓舞社员们，就冒着危险取出了毛主席著作单行本四十多册。
    毛主席著作，鼓舞和指引社员向自然灾害作斗争。今年的麦收取得了好收成。六月十日上午，林仁素组织女民兵到地里捡麦穗。快到晌午，干着干着突然有人说：“喂！咱队麦地差不多都拾了一遍，怎么麦穗还这么多？”一句话把大家提醒了，林仁素说：“咱和舍落口村的地交界，是不是拾错了？”经过查对，那块地果然是舍落口村的。这时大家争论起来：“这可怎么办？他们知道了，会不会有人说是偷的？”还有人说：“干脆咱把麦子偷偷地扔到舍落口村地里算了”。林仁素反对这样做，她说：“我们天天学毛主席著作，现在，就要按毛主席的指示来处理这件事。”最后确定由林仁素带领三名女民兵，利用中午休息时间，背着八捆麦子，送到舍落口村去。
    到了那里，找到队干部，林仁素把前后经过详细说了一遍，在把麦子交给他们的同时，还郑重地把两本毛主席著作送给了贫协主席。贫协主席感动地握着林仁素的手说：“你们真是毛主席的好民兵，不仅把麦子送来了，更重要的是给我们带来了毛泽东思想，带来了共产主义风格。”
    这天傍晚，林庄也热闹起来了，舍落口村党支部派代表，敲锣打鼓，向林庄社员道谢。林庄群众夹道欢迎。舍落口村代表向林庄党支部、贫协和广大群众宣读了感谢信，接着又赠送了贵重礼物——十二本毛主席著作。大家都说：“咱们贫下中农，一刻也不能离开毛主席的著作啊！”（附图片）
