The Albanian people, advancing vigorously on the road of revolution, today participated in the election of representatives to the People's Assembly with high political enthusiasm.

July 10th was the day of the Albanian People's Assembly election. On this day, the entire country was immersed in a festive atmosphere. Voters blew horns and drums, dressed in festive attire, and with boundless excitement and joy in their hearts, they flocked to the polling stations from early in the morning to cast their votes for the representatives of the highest organ of state power.

In the capital, Tirana, voting began at six in the morning and was almost entirely completed by eleven o'clock, with over 99.99% of the voters participating.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour, Enver Hoxha, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mehmet Shehu, and other party and government leaders such as Balluku, Toska, Muftiu, Alia, and Kolega, voted together with the voters at the 6th polling station in the 209th electoral district in Tirana from six to nine in the morning. At around eight o'clock, when Comrade Hoxha arrived at the polling station accompanied by the First Secretary of the Tirana City Committee, Muftiu, the crowd that had been waiting since early morning immediately erupted in thunderous applause and shouts of "Enver Hoxha" and "Party of Labour" filled the air. After voting, Comrade Hoxha walked out of the polling station and repeatedly waved and greeted the crowd gathered there.

Many polling stations in Tirana completed voting for all voters within an hour, fully demonstrating the political enthusiasm of the Albanian people. An 89-year-old voter, Vadena, arrived at the 22nd polling station in the 211th electoral district in Tirana at half past five in the morning, requesting to be the first to vote. He said: "I am very happy to participate in this election because I see that our country is undergoing tremendous changes and becoming more and more prosperous and powerful under the leadership of the Party of Labour and Comrade Hoxha."

A soldier from a certain unit of the People's Army, Makolli, said: "We soldiers, like the people of the whole country, have launched a great revolutionary upsurge after the publication of the Central Committee's open letter, and this revolutionary upsurge is very clearly manifested in this election campaign."
