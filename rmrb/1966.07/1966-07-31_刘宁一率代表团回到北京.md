By delegation head Liu Ningyi, the Chinese delegation attending the 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Japan returned to Beijing by plane tonight after two days of negotiations with the Japanese Consulate-General in Hong Kong following the serious incident of the Japanese Sato government's outright rejection of the delegation head Liu Ningyi's visit to Japan. In recent days, various people's organizations in China have sent out telegrams filled with indignation to protest; at the same time, people from all walks of life in Japan, from the Japan-China Friendship Association, the left wing of the Socialist Party, famous figures in the cultural sphere to the enlightened members of the Liberal Democratic Party, have all made statements, unanimously condemning the Sato reactionary government's reckless and arrogant measures of hostility towards China.

More than 500 people from various circles in the capital and responsible persons from various people's organizations in China, as well as dozens of Japanese friends in Beijing, stood in the rain at the airport to warmly welcome the return of the Chinese delegation.

Before the delegation's plane arrived, the welcoming crowd was discussing, condemning in angry voices the serious crime of the Japanese Sato government obstructing the Chinese delegation's visit to Japan. Many people recalled the events that had taken place in Tokyo, Japan, over the past month and a half, pointing out that the Sato government's deliberate sabotage of the Chinese delegation's visit to Japan further exposed the conspiracy of Japanese militarism to collude with American imperialism and the Soviet modern revisionist clique. What is particularly regrettable is that behind this conspiracy, there are indeed various accomplices of Soviet revisionism; those who pretend to be sincere but actually use every means to obstruct the entry of delegation head Liu Ningyi into Japan are not few. This exposes another despicable act of deliberately sabotaging the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan following the incident of the Chinese youth representative Qian Dawai's inability to go to Japan.

    刘宁一率代表团回到北京
    首都各界五百多人和在京的日本朋友到机场欢迎
    欢迎的人群愤怒谴责日本佐藤政府及其形形色色的新旧伙伴蓄意破坏中日人民友好关系，阻挠中国代表团去日本的严重罪行
    新华社三十日讯　日本佐藤政府悍然拒绝中国代表团团长刘宁一前往日本的严重事件发生以后，连日以来，我国各人民团体纷纷发出了充满愤怒的抗议电报；同时日本的各界人士，从日中友好协会、社会党左派、文化界知名人士以至自由民主党中的有识之士，都发表谈话，一致声讨了佐藤反动政府敌视中国的不计后果的横蛮措施。
    由团长刘宁一率领的出席在日本举行的第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的中国代表团，在香港同日本总领事馆进行了两天的交涉之后，今晚全体成员乘飞机返回北京。
    首都各界五百多人和我国各人民团体的负责人，以及在北京的数十名日本朋友，冒雨伫立机场，热烈欢迎中国代表团的归来。
    在等待代表团座机到达之前，欢迎的人群都在交谈，以愤怒的声音谴责日本佐藤政府阻挠中国代表团前往日本的严重罪行。不少人追溯近一个半月来在日本东京发生的事件，指出佐藤政府蓄意破坏中国代表团前往日本，更加证实了日本军国主义勾结美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义集团的阴谋。而令人十分遗憾的，就是在这阴谋的背后，竟有苏联修正主义的形形色色的帮凶；那种口头上假惺惺，实际上无所不用其极地阻挠刘宁一团长进入日本的却大有人在。这样就暴露了在中国青年代表钱大卫去日不行的事件之后，蓄意破坏中日两国人民友好关系的又一次卑劣行为。
