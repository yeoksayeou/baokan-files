The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is surging forward. Batch after batch of monsters and demons have been exposed, and one after another, reactionary strongholds have been overthrown. Under the direct support of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Beijing, as well as the broad cadres and revolutionary intellectuals of the Party, have exposed and overthrown the anti-Party, anti-socialist conspiracy clique of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee. The counter-revolutionary, revisionist faces of some main leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee have been fully exposed.

This is a major and good event in the history of the proletarian dictatorship in our country, and it is a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

The leadership of some main leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee is permeated with a black line of anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. The main points of this black line are to oppose the proletarian revolution, oppose the proletarian dictatorship, oppose the correct line of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and implement a counter-revolutionary, revisionist line. This is manifested in the following aspects:

First, resisting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Some main leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee are extremely afraid of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and stubbornly oppose and sabotage the Cultural Revolution. Their counter-revolutionary, revisionist line was exposed in this Cultural Revolution. Under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China launched a criticism of Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," sounding the trumpet for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Shanghai "Wenhui Daily" published Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "Critique of the New Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,'" which infuriated the group of revisionist lords of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee. They brazenly attacked the Shanghai Municipal Committee and openly resisted the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong. They regarded Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article as a flood and a beast, using the propaganda tools in their hands to resist and block it in every possible way. They used all kinds of vile and malicious means to suppress and strike at all proletarian revolutionaries who insisted on Comrade Mao Zedong's correct line, and they shielded those anti-Party, anti-socialist, counter-revolutionary black gangsters. After Comrade Mao Zedong criticized the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, they still carried out organized, planned resistance, attempting to sacrifice the horses and carriages to save the commander. The editorial note of "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" on April 16 is a concentrated expression of their playing this counter-revolutionary two-faced trick. They also carried out a series of secret, underground, and illegal activities, defending their positions and collecting materials on the proletarian revolutionaries to prepare for a counterattack. This series of anti-Party activities prepared the conditions for their own complete collapse. A group of representatives of the bourgeoisie who had hidden in the Party for a long time thus had their counter-revolutionary faces exposed.

Second, opposing the socialist education movement in cities and countryside. The former Beijing Municipal Party Committee opposed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and was consistently opposed to the socialist education movement in cities and countryside and the continuation and development of the socialist revolution over the years. They resisted the policies of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee on the socialist education movement in cities and countryside, opposed the mobilization of the masses to expose the lid of class struggle, protected the capitalist-roaders in power at the grassroots level in cities and countryside, and protected the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. When the socialist education movement in cities and countryside deepened, they were eager to "brake" and carried out a series of rehabilitation activities, supporting the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, striking at the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary activists, and carrying out organized, planned counterattacks and revenge. The line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee is a line against the socialist revolution and a line to restore capitalism.

Third, abandoning the class and class struggle viewpoint and attempting "peaceful evolution." The former Beijing Municipal Party Committee stubbornly resisted Comrade Mao Zedong's guiding principles on class and class struggle in socialist society. In cultural education, industry, agriculture, commerce, and other work, they opposed putting class struggle in command. They opposed highlighting proletarian politics and instead highlighted bourgeois politics. They abandoned the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought views on class and class struggle and inevitably fell into the quagmire of Khrushchev revisionism. What they implemented was actually the revisionist goods of Khrushchev's "whole people's party" and "whole people's state." Their bourgeois nature is very clear. On all fronts, they ruthlessly suppressed and struck at the proletarian revolutionary leftists and revolutionary masses, allowing all monsters and demons to come out. This small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists carried out "peaceful evolution" in some units and departments of the Party and government organs in Beijing, making the leadership of these units and departments usurped by representatives of the bourgeoisie.

Fourth, turning the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship. A small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, under the banner of the proletarian dictatorship, actually attempted to implement bourgeois dictatorship. They suppressed and struck at the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as the broad cadres and revolutionary intellectuals of the Party, acting arbitrarily and not speaking of democracy at all. Their "democracy" is the democracy of a small group of bourgeois representatives who are anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, the democracy of a small group of reactionary "academic authorities" of the bourgeoisie, and the democracy of a small group of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They are a group of bullies and a group of Yama kings.

Fifth, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism and the overthrow of the proletarian regime. A small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee attach great importance to creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism and the overthrow of the proletarian regime. They used "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" as tools to spread anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought revisionist poison. They used the newspapers, magazines, radio, books, lectures, literary works, films, and dramas they could control to spread poison and corrupt and poison the people of the whole country. All of this is to create conditions for the restoration of capitalism.

Sixth, opposing the educational policy proposed by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee and implementing a bourgeois, revisionist educational policy. The schools controlled by some main leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee are not for the service of proletarian politics but for the service of the restoration of the bourgeoisie. They do not cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause but cultivate new bourgeois intellectuals. They cherish the bourgeois elements to the extreme and exclude and strike at the broad revolutionary teachers and students. The Beijing University under their control is a typical reactionary and stubborn stronghold.

Seventh, opposing the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. A small group of people in the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee vigorously opposed the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and cadres in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They were extremely hostile to Mao Zedong Thought and opposed, cursed, and raged as soon as they heard Mao Zedong Thought. They suppressed and struck at the workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres who listened to Chairman Mao's words and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. This small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists did nothing but evil. They were most afraid of exposing their true colors in the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought. They were most afraid that the broad masses would grasp the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to overthrow their reactionary rule.

Eighth, recruiting and absorbing traitors, forming factions and cliques. The main leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, in order to promote their revisionist political line, implemented a feudal gangster and factional organizational line. The main leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee used vile means such as granting official positions and recruiting traitors to buy and lure a group of people, forming a close-knit group and acting as their faithful running dogs.

Ninth, implementing a strict blockade against the Party Central Committee. A small group of anti-Party elements of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee regarded Beijing as an "independent kingdom," where water could not be splashed in, needles could not be inserted, no one could interfere, no one could criticize, and no one could touch the tiger's buttocks. But they wanted to reach out everywhere. They are a group of conspirators and ambitious people.

Tenth, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag. These anti-Party, anti-socialist revisionists were able to hide for a relatively long period mainly because they waved the red flag to oppose the red flag. They hung the sign of Marxism-Leninism but opposed Marxism-Leninism. They hung the sign of Mao Zedong Thought but opposed Mao Zedong Thought. They hung the sign of the proletarian dictatorship but opposed the proletarian dictatorship. They hung the sign of the Communist Party but did anti-Communist deeds. What the main leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee did is exactly like Khrushchev. They are people like Khrushchev.

The Party Central Committee gradually became aware of the revisionist line of some main leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee. However, the thorough exposure of their revisionist nature still required a process and certain soil and climate. Poisonous snakes also need certain climatic conditions to come out of their holes. Once the poisonous snakes come out of their holes, they are immediately caught by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee and immediately overthrown by the broad cadres and masses of the Party.

The exposure of some main leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee as an anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought black gang is a good thing and a normal phenomenon in the life of the Party. Comrade Mao Zedong has long told us that if there are no contradictions and struggles within the Party, the life of the Party will stop. The contradictions within the Party can, under certain conditions, turn from non-antagonistic contradictions into antagonistic contradictions. Our Party's ability to timely expose and smash the reactionary stronghold monopolized by a small group of revisionists, the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, precisely shows that our Party is powerful and strong, and that the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee is extremely wise and great.

Some main leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee are a good negative example. They tell us that to promote the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and seize back the leadership in the cultural field that has been usurped by the bourgeoisie, we must first expose, criticize, and struggle against those bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party, government, army, and various sectors of the cultural field. The struggle against this batch of anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought revisionists is a struggle between restoration and anti-restoration, a struggle to prevent the proletarian dictatorship from turning into a bourgeois dictatorship.

The spirited workers, peasants, and soldiers of Beijing, as well as the broad cadres and revolutionary intellectuals of the Party, have armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon of struggle and criticism. Under the leadership of the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee, they are sweeping away all monsters and demons with the momentum of a thousand thunderstorms.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Beijing, as well as the broad Party members, League members, and revolutionary intellectuals, have long resisted and struggled against the anti-Party, anti-socialist black line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee. They love Chairman Mao limitlessly and support the Party Central Committee. They have done a lot of work according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and made their own contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction. More than 95% of the people and more than 95% of the cadres in Beijing will definitely unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, regard Chairman Mao's words as the highest instructions for all work, and under the leadership of the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee, thoroughly eliminate the influence of the counter-revolutionary, revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee and achieve new victories on all fronts.

    彻底批判前北京市委一些主要负责人的修正主义路线
    《红旗》杂志一九六六年第九期社论
    无产阶级文化大革命迅猛地向前发展。一批一批的牛鬼蛇神被揭露出来，一个一个的反动堡垒被冲垮。在毛主席和党中央的直接支持下，北京市的广大工农兵群众，广大的党的干部和革命知识分子，揭露了、推翻了前北京市委这个反党反社会主义的阴谋集团。前北京市委一些主要负责人的反革命修正主义嘴脸充分地暴露出来了。
    这是我国无产阶级专政历史上的一件大好的重大事件，这是毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    前北京市委一些主要负责人的领导，贯串着一条反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑线。这条黑线的主要点，就是反对无产阶级革命，反对无产阶级专政，反对党中央和毛泽东同志的正确路线，实行反革命的修正主义路线。它表现在以下几个方面：
    第一，抗拒无产阶级文化大革命。前北京市委一些主要负责人非常害怕无产阶级文化大革命，顽固地反对和破坏文化大革命。他们的反革命修正主义路线，正是在这场文化大革命中暴露的。在毛主席和党中央的直接领导下，中共上海市委发动了对吴晗《海瑞罢官》的批判，吹起了无产阶级文化大革命的号角。上海《文汇报》刊登了姚文元同志《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》的文章，这就触怒了前北京市委那帮修正主义老爷们。他们肆无忌惮地攻击上海市委，公然抗拒毛泽东同志的指示。他们把姚文元同志的文章，视作洪水猛兽，运用掌握在他们手里的宣传工具，千方百计地进行抵制和封锁。他们使用种种卑鄙恶毒的手段，压制和打击一切坚持毛泽东同志正确路线的无产阶级革命派，包庇那些反党反社会主义反革命的黑帮分子。在毛泽东同志批判了前北京市委以后，他们还进行有组织、有计划的抵抗，企图牺牲车马，保存主帅。《前线》和《北京日报》四月十六日的编者按语，就是他们玩弄这种反革命的两面手法的一个集中表现。他们还进行了一系列秘密的、地下的、非法的活动，死守阵地，并且收集无产阶级革命派的材料，准备反扑。这一系列的反党活动，为他们自己的彻底垮台准备了条件。一帮在党内隐藏了很久的资产阶级代表人物的反革命面目，就这样地被识破了。
    第二，反对城乡社会主义教育运动。前北京市委反对无产阶级文化大革命，是他们几年来一贯反对城乡社会主义教育运动，反对社会主义革命的继续和发展。他们对抗毛主席和党中央关于城乡社会主义教育运动的方针，反对放手发动群众揭开阶级斗争的盖子，保护城乡基层的那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，保护地、富、反、坏、右。当城乡社会主义教育运动深入发展的时候，他们就迫不及待地要“刹车”，并且大搞翻案活动，为地、富、反、坏、右撑腰，打击贫下中农和革命的积极分子，进行有组织、有计划的反攻倒算。前北京市委的这条路线，就是反对社会主义革命的路线，就是复辟资本主义的路线。
    第三，抛弃阶级和阶级斗争的观点，企图“和平演变”。前北京市委顽固地对抗毛泽东同志关于社会主义社会阶级和阶级斗争的指导方针。他们在文化教育、工业、农业、财贸等各项工作中，都反对以阶级斗争为纲。他们反对突出无产阶级政治，而突出资产阶级政治。他们抛弃了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于阶级和阶级斗争的观点，就不能不陷入赫鲁晓夫修正主义的泥坑。他们实行的，实际上就是赫鲁晓夫“全民党”、“全民国家”那一套修正主义的货色。他们的资产阶级本性是很鲜明的。他们在各条战线上，残酷地压制和打击无产阶级革命左派和革命群众，放手让一切牛鬼蛇神出笼。这一小撮反革命的修正主义分子，在北京市党政机关的一些单位和一些部门，实行“和平演变”，使这些单位和部门的领导权，为资产阶级代表人物所篡夺。
    第四，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。前北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子打着无产阶级专政的旗号，实际上力图实行的是资产阶级独裁。他们对广大的工农兵，广大的党的干部和革命知识分子，实行压制和打击，专横独断，丝毫不讲民主。他们的“民主”，是一小撮反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级代表人物的民主，是一小撮资产阶级反动“学术权威”的民主，是一小撮地、富、反、坏、右的民主。他们是一批恶霸，是一批阎罗王。
    第五，为复辟资本主义、颠覆无产阶级政权作舆论准备。前北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子，非常重视制造复辟资本主义、颠覆无产阶级政权的舆论。他们把《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》当作反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想，散布修正主义毒素的工具。他们利用他们能够掌握的报纸、刊物、广播、书籍、讲坛、文学作品、电影、戏剧等等，大肆放毒，腐蚀和毒害全国人民。所有这一切，都是为复辟资本主义准备条件的。
    第六，反对毛主席和党中央提出的教育方针，实行资产阶级的、修正主义的教育方针。前北京市委一些主要负责人所控制的一些学校不是为无产阶级政治服务，而是为资产阶级复辟服务。他们不是培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人，而是培养新的资产阶级知识分子。他们对资产阶级分子爱护备至，对广大的革命师生进行排斥和打击。在他们控制下的北京大学，就是一个典型的反动的顽固堡垒。
    第七，反对活学活用毛主席著作。前北京市委一小撮人竭力反对广大工农兵群众和干部活学活用毛主席著作。他们十分仇视毛泽东思想，一听到毛泽东思想就反对，就咒骂，就暴跳如雷。他们对听毛主席的话，照毛主席指示办事的工农兵群众和革命干部，进行压制和打击。这一小撮反革命修正主义分子尽做坏事，他们最害怕在毛泽东思想的阳光下，暴露自己的原形。他们最害怕广大群众掌握毛泽东思想这个威力无穷的武器，来推翻他们的反动统治。
    第八，招降纳叛，结党营私。前北京市委那些主要负责人为了推行他们的修正主义的政治路线，实行一套封建帮会的、结党营私的组织路线。前北京市委的主要负责人采用封官许愿、招降纳叛等等卑鄙手段，收买拉拢一帮人，结成死党，充当他们的忠实走狗。
    第九，对党中央实行严密封锁。前北京市委一小撮反党分子，他们把北京市当成一个“独立王国”，水泼不进，针插不进，谁也过问不得，谁也批评不得，老虎屁股摸不得。但他们却要到处伸手。他们是一个阴谋家、野心家的集团。
    第十，打着红旗反红旗。这些反党反社会主义的修正主义分子，所以能够在相当长的时期内隐藏下来，主要是因为他们打着红旗反红旗。他们挂着马克思列宁主义的招牌，反对马克思列宁主义。挂着毛泽东思想的招牌，反对毛泽东思想。挂着无产阶级专政的招牌，反对无产阶级专政。挂着共产党的招牌，干着反共的勾当。前北京市委主要负责人所干的这一套，同赫鲁晓夫维妙维肖。他们就是赫鲁晓夫那样的人物。
    党中央对前北京市委主要负责人的修正主义路线，是逐步有所察觉的。但是，他们修正主义本质的彻底暴露，还需要有一个过程，需要有一定的土壤和气候。毒蛇也要在一定气候条件下才会出洞的。毒蛇一出洞，就立即被毛主席和党中央把它捉住了，就立即被广大的党的干部、广大的群众打倒了。
    前北京市委一些主要负责人这个反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮被揭出来，是一件大好事，是党的生活中的正常现象。毛泽东同志早就告诉我们，党内如果没有矛盾和斗争，党的生命就停止了。党内的矛盾，在一定条件下，可以由非对抗性矛盾变成为对抗性矛盾。我们党能够及时地识破和摧毁由一小撮修正主义分子垄断的前北京市委这个反动堡垒，恰好表明我们党是强大有力的，表明毛主席和党中央的领导是非常英明非常伟大的。
    前北京市委一些主要负责人是一个很好的反面教员。它告诉我们，要推进无产阶级文化大革命，夺回在文化领域里被资产阶级篡夺了的领导权，必须首先揭露、批判、斗争那些混进党里、政府里、军队里和文化领域各界里的资产阶级代表人物。同这一批反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的修正主义分子的斗争，是复辟反复辟的斗争，是防止无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政的斗争。
    意气风发的北京市广大工农兵，广大党的干部和革命知识分子，在无产阶级文化大革命中，用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来，用毛泽东思想作为战斗的批判的武器。他们正在新的北京市委的领导下，以雷霆万钧之势，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。
    北京市的广大工农兵群众，广大的党团员、广大革命知识分子，长期以来，对前北京市委反党反社会主义的黑线，进行了抵制和斗争。他们无限地热爱毛主席，拥护党中央。他们按照党中央和毛主席的指示，做了很多工作，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业做出了自己的贡献。北京市百分之九十五以上的人民群众，百分之九十五以上的干部，一定能够在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来，把毛主席的话当作各项工作的最高指示，在新的北京市委的领导下，彻底肃清前北京市委反革命修正主义路线的影响，在各条战线上取得新的胜利。
