Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and are for their use.
		Mao Zedong

Editor's Note: Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" brilliantly and creatively developed Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory. The republication of this brilliant work has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Every revolutionary fighter in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is eagerly studying this "Talk" again, drawing immense inspiration from it, and obtaining the sharpest weapon to distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are determined to use the "Talk" as the highest directive to thoroughly uproot the revisionist black line that has long dominated the literary and artistic sphere, represented by Zhou Yang, and to create a brilliant new culture for the proletariat. Nothing can be established without destruction, nothing can flow without obstruction, and nothing can stop. Only by resolutely uprooting the revisionist literary black line can Chairman Mao's literary line be further implemented, and only then can the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers truly become the masters of socialist literature and art.

The workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They know the monsters and demons best, see them most clearly, aim at them most accurately, and strike them most fiercely. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, together with revolutionary literary and artistic workers, to use the "Talk" as a compass, a magic mirror, and a battle cry. Under the inspiration of the "Talk," they will fight to expose, overthrow, and defeat all monsters and demons, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Our great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was republished on the 45th anniversary of the Party. This is a major event for the people of the whole country and the world. We enthusiastically hail it!

Now, a magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is underway across the country. All monsters and demons are trembling with fear, and the big and small "three families" that are anti-Party and anti-socialist are being destroyed one by one. The reason why this cultural revolution is so powerful, invincible, and irresistible is mainly because the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have grasped the great Mao Zedong Thought. We have the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and other relevant works by Chairman Mao as our sharpest weapons.

The "Talk" is our compass. It points out the direction for literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the path for literary and artistic workers to combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They go deep into the fiery struggles and combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only then can they break through the extremely stubborn Beijing opera stronghold and create excellent plays like "The Red Lantern," "The White-Haired Girl," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and "The Attack on the White Tiger Regiment"; only then can they break through all old and foreign frameworks and create the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," "The White-Haired Girl," and the sculpture "The Rent Collection Courtyard"; only then can they produce novels like "The Song of Ouyang Hai" and excellent units like the naval cultural work team of the Guangzhou Army. Under the guidance of the "Talk," we can stand firm and withstand the storms of class struggle.

The "Talk" is a magic mirror. With it, we can see who is a true revolutionary and who is a false one, and distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. We can see that "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," "Hai Rui's Rebuke of the Emperor," "The Enemy at the Gate," "Thousands of Miles Against the Wind," and "Recruiting Soldiers" are all poisonous arrows against the Party and socialism. We can see that the "three families" are anti-Party and anti-socialist dens, and that "Night Talks at Yan Mountain" is anti-Party and anti-socialist black talk. We can expose those wolves in sheep's clothing and the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party. No matter how cunning and deceitful these people are, no matter where they hide, once we use the "Talk" as a magic mirror, they will all be exposed and have nowhere to hide.

The "Talk" is a battle cry. It sounds the battle call for us to launch a fierce attack on the black gangs on the cultural front, calling on all revolutionary people to take action and actively participate in this cultural revolution to promote proletarian culture and eliminate bourgeois culture. Under the condemnation of hundreds of millions of people, we have smashed big and small "three families" and exposed anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black gang members. Now, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals have taken action with unprecedented power to march towards every corner occupied by monsters and demons. The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is unstoppable. Anyone who dares to block it will be like an egg hitting a stone, inevitably ending in a smashed head and shattered body.

In this great revolutionary movement, we workers, peasants, and soldiers have taken on the glorious task of being the main force. Where does our wisdom and strength come from? It comes from Chairman Mao's "Talk" and other works, and from the great Mao Zedong Thought. We, the people's soldiers, listen to Chairman Mao the most. We have an infinite love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao's works. We will definitely use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, thoroughly criticize the old world, and create a brand-new world!

专栏：

    我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。
                                      毛泽东
    编者按：毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，天才地创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论。这篇光辉著作的重新发表，受到了广大工农兵群众的热烈欢呼。每一个正在无产阶级文化大革命中冲锋陷阵的战士，如饥似渴地重新学习这篇《讲话》，从中得到了巨大的鼓舞力量，掌握了辨别香花和毒草的最锐利的武器。广大工农兵群众，决心以《讲话》为最高指示，彻底铲除长期统治着文艺界的、以周扬为代表的反党反社会主义的修正主义黑线，创造无产阶级的灿烂的新文化。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。只有坚决铲除修正主义的文艺黑线，毛主席的文艺路线才能进一步得到贯彻，广大工农兵群众才能真正成为社会主义文艺的主人。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众，是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军。他们对牛鬼蛇神认得最清，看得最深，瞄得最准，打得最狠。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同革命文艺工作者一起，以《讲话》为指南针，以《讲话》为照妖镜，在《讲话》的进军号鼓舞下，把一切牛鬼蛇神斗臭、斗垮、斗倒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
　　指南针　照妖镜　进军号
　　中国人民解放军某部战士　卢浩然
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，在党的四十五周年纪念日重新发表，这是全国和全世界革命人民的一件大事。我们为它热烈欢呼！
  现在，全国正进行着一场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，一切牛鬼蛇神都闻风丧胆，反党反社会主义的大小“三家村”正被逐个摧毁。这场文化大革命之所以如此气势磅礴、所向无敌、锐不可当，主要是我们广大工农兵掌握了伟大的毛泽东思想，我们手中有《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和毛主席的其他有关著作这些最锐利的武器。
    《讲话》是指南针。是它给我们指出了文艺为工农兵服务的方向，指出了文艺工作者和工农兵相结合的道路。革命的文艺工作者读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，深入火热的斗争，同工农兵结合，才能攻破十分顽固的京剧堡垒，创作出《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《智取威虎山》、《奇袭白虎团》那样的好戏；才能打破一切旧框框和洋框框，创造出芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》和泥塑《收租院》，才能出现《欧阳海之歌》那样的长篇小说，才能出现广州部队海上文化工作队那样的优秀单位。在《讲话》的指引下，我们才能在这场阶级斗争的大风大浪里站得稳、顶得住。
    《讲话》是照妖镜。有了它，我们就能够看出谁是真革命，谁是假革命，就能辨别什么是香花，什么是毒草。我们就能看出《海瑞罢官》、《海瑞骂皇帝》和《兵临城下》、《逆风千里》、《抓壮丁》等等，统统是反党反社会主义的毒箭，就能看出“三家村”是反党反社会主义的黑店，就能看出《燕山夜话》是反党反社会主义的黑话，就能把那些披着羊皮的狼，把钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物揪出来。不管这些人多么阴险，多么狡猾，不管他们藏在哪个角落，用《讲话》这个照妖镜一照，他们就一个个原形毕露，无处藏身。
    《讲话》是进军号。它给我们吹响了向文化战线上的黑帮猛烈开火的战斗号角，号召广大革命人民行动起来，积极参加这场兴无灭资的文化大革命。在亿万人民的声讨下，捣毁了大大小小的“三家村”，揪出了反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮分子。现在广大工农兵、广大革命干部、广大革命知识分子已经行动起来，以无比的威力向一切牛鬼蛇神盘踞的角落进军。无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，是任何人都阻挡不了的，谁要胆敢阻挡，谁就是鸡蛋碰石头，必然是头破血流、粉身碎骨。
    在这场伟大的革命运动中，我们工农兵担当了主力军的光荣任务。我们的智慧和力量从何而来？就来自毛主席的《讲话》和其他著作，来自伟大的毛泽东思想。我们人民战士，最听毛主席的话。我们对毛主席的著作无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜。我们一定要用毛泽东思想作武器，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，彻底批判旧世界，创造一个崭新的新世界！
