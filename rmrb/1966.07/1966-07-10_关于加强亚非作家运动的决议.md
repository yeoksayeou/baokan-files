Edition: 9

The emergency meeting of Asian-African writers held in Beijing from June 27 to July 9, 1966, supports the solemn statement issued by the Permanent Bureau of Asian-African Writers on June 23, 1966, condemning the split meeting. The emergency meeting believes that all illegal decisions made by the split meeting, including the decision to hold a so-called Asian-African Writers' Conference in Baku, are acts that undermine the unity of Asian-African writers and split the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian-African peoples.

The meeting proposes to the Permanent Bureau:

	To take all necessary steps against any activities aimed at splitting the Asian-African writers' movement;
	To make every possible effort, through various literary activities, such as translating as many books and literary works as possible about the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people into as many languages as possible, to strengthen support for the struggle of the Vietnamese people;
	To consolidate the "Asian-African Writers' Library" already established at the headquarters of the Permanent Bureau in Colombo;
	To improve the publication of the Permanent Bureau's journal "Call" and take steps to ensure its wider circulation in Asian-African countries;
	To take all necessary steps to promote the publication and wide circulation of works by Asian-African writers, to encourage the creation of literary works serving the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian-African peoples;
	To hold training sessions for young Asian-African writers;
	To have countries from the two continents of Asia and Africa exchange Asian-African writers' delegations more frequently than at present, in order to promote cultural exchanges among them, and to take steps to implement the Permanent Bureau's decision to establish an Asian-African Writers' Sanatorium.

    关于加强亚非作家运动的决议
    一九六六年六月二十七日至七月九日在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议支持亚非作家常设局于一九六六年六月二十三日谴责分裂会议的庄严声明。紧急会议认为，分裂会议所作出的一切非法决定，包括关于在巴库举行一个所谓亚非作家会议的决定，都是破坏亚非作家团结和分裂亚非人民反帝斗争团结的行为。
    会议向常设局建议：
    对任何人旨在分裂亚非作家运动而进行的活动采取一切必要的步骤；
    作出一切可能的努力，通过各种文学活动，诸如以尽可能多的语文翻译关于越南人民英勇斗争的书籍和文学作品，来加强对越南人民斗争的支持；
    巩固已设立在常设局总部所在地科伦坡的“亚非作家图书馆”；
    改进亚非作家常设局的刊物《号召》，并采取步骤以保证在亚非国家中更为广泛地发行这个刊物；
    采取一切必要步骤，促进尽可能多地出版和尽可能广泛地发行亚非作家的作品，来鼓励创作为亚非人民反帝斗争服务的文学作品；
    为亚非青年作家举办讲习会；
    亚非两大洲的国家比目前更经常地交换亚非作家代表团，旨在促进他们之间的文化联系，并采取步骤以执行常设局建立一所亚非作家疗养院的决定。
