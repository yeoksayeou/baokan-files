All revolutionary students of Yan'an University, upon listening to the letter from Li Yusheng and six other comrades to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on the radio, sent a telegram to this newspaper, expressing their resolute support for their revolutionary initiative. The telegram said: Your letter is excellent! We enthusiastically endorse and resolutely support your revolutionary actions. Your letter not only expresses the sentiments of liberal arts students but also represents the shared aspirations of students in mathematics, physics, chemistry, forestry, medicine, and other fields. Your indictment of the old educational system is a revolutionary "bombshell" that strikes at the heart of the bourgeoisie. Your initiative is a revolutionary initiative; your resolve is a revolutionary resolve; your actions boost the morale of the proletariat and crush the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. You are the vanguard of the revolution to smash the old educational system and are truly the youth of the great Mao Zedong era.

We, like you, are also victims of the old educational system. The old educational system has long constrained us, eroded our revolutionary will, harmed our bodies, and instilled in us a large amount of bourgeois and revisionist poison. Those bourgeois "authorities" have attempted, through the method of "peaceful evolution," to cultivate us into the obedient children of the bourgeoisie, aiming to change the color of our country and our party, and to restore capitalism in China. We warn these bourgeois "authorities": You are mistaken; your beautiful dreams will never come true.

We are the youth of the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, studying and living in the place where the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao once resided, and receiving the education and influence of the glorious revolutionary traditions of Yan'an. The heroic deeds of revolutionary martyrs constantly inspire us. We must take up the revolutionary banner soaked in blood and carry it forward, forever remaining steadfast revolutionaries. We are determined to stand with you, shoulder to shoulder, and launch a fierce attack on those bourgeois "authorities," smashing all old educational systems, and ensuring that the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought flies high and forever in the educational front of the proletariat!

　　坚决发扬延安的革命传统  坚决扛起先辈的革命红旗
　　延安大学全体革命同学欢呼人大七同学的信写得好
    本报讯　延安大学全体革命学生，在收音机里，听了李豫生等七位同学给党中央和毛主席的信后，打电报给本报，表示坚决支持他们的革命倡议。电报说：你们的信写得好！我们热烈拥护，坚决支持你们的革命行动。你们的信，不但说出了文科同学的心里话，也表达了数、理、化、林、医等各科同学的共同心愿。你们对旧教育制度的控诉，是一颗革命的“炸弹”，打中了资产阶级老爷们的要害。你们的倡议，是革命的倡议；你们的志愿，是革命的志愿；你们的行动，长了无产阶级的志气，灭了资产阶级的威风。你们是打碎旧教育制度的革命先锋，不愧是伟大的毛泽东时代的青年。
    我们和你们一样，也是旧教育制度的受害者。旧教育制度长期以来束缚着我们，消磨了我们的革命意志，残害了我们的身体，给我们灌输了大量的资产阶级、修正主义的毒素，那些资产阶级的“权威”老爷们，通过“和平演变”的手段，妄图把我们培养成为资产阶级的孝子贤孙，妄图使我们的国家、我们的党变颜色，在中国复辟资本主义。警告这些资产阶级的“权威”老爷们：你们想错了，你们的黄粱美梦是不能实现的。
    我们是革命圣地——延安的青年，学习和生活在党中央和毛主席住过的地方，受着光荣的延安革命传统的教育和熏陶。革命先烈们的英雄事迹，时时在鼓舞着我们。我们一定要把鲜血染红的革命大旗接过来，扛到底，要永远做坚定的革命派，决心和你们站在一起，并肩携手，向那些资产阶级“权威”老爷们猛烈开火，砸碎一切旧的教育制度，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在无产阶级的教育阵地上，高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
                          延安大学全体革命同学
                          一九六六年七月十二日
