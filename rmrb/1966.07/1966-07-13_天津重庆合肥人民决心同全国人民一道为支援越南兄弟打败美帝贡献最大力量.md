	According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 12th: More than five thousand people from Tianjin gathered for a grand meeting on the afternoon of the 11th, strongly condemning U.S. imperialism for escalating its aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious stage.

	Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, Yang Zhimin, spoke at the meeting. He said, "This time, U.S. imperialism's bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is the product of a dirty political deal between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, a major conspiracy of 'bombing for negotiations.' The shameful role played by the Soviet revisionist clique and the Indian reactionaries, as well as their dirty dealings, will be smashed in the tide of the anti-U.S. struggle by the Vietnamese people and people around the world."

	Vietnamese student and intern representative Lin Baimei spoke at the meeting. She said, "The so-called 'unconditional negotiations' by U.S. imperialism is purely a deception to mislead the world.

    天津市副市长杨拯民在会上讲话。他说，这次美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防，是美苏进行肮脏的政治交易的产物，是美苏勾结玩弄“以炸迫和”的大阴谋。苏联修正主义集团和印度反动派所扮演的这种可耻的角色，以及他们这种肮脏的勾当，必将在越南人民和全世界人民反美斗争的洪流中被粉碎。
    越南留学生、实习生代表林白牡丹在大会上讲话。她说，美帝国主义的所谓“无条件谈判”，纯粹是蒙蔽世界人民的一个骗局，越南三千一百万人民比谁都更清楚美帝国主义的侵略本性。她表示，越南人民不把美帝国主义完全彻底地从自己的国土上赶出去，决不罢休。
    参加大会的有河北省副省长高树勋、中共天津市委书记处书记张淮三，天津市副市长宋景毅和驻军负责人盛元忠等。在天津的越南朋友应邀出席。

    正在重庆的越南朋友阮德鹃在会上讲话。他说，美帝国主义对越南人民犯下的新的滔天罪行，更加坚定了我们越南人民狠揍美国强盗的决心。江可枯，山可穿，我们三千一百万越南人民战胜美帝国主义的决心永不变。
