The 3.8 million mu of cotton in the Guanzhong cotton-growing area of Shaanxi Province is growing very well. The cotton is currently in the budding stage, about ten days earlier than last year, and many cotton plants have already set two to three bolls before the summer solstice. Currently, community members across the region are strengthening field management to strive for increased cotton production this year.

During this year's cotton sowing period, the Guanzhong region experienced a relatively severe drought, which brought many difficulties to cotton sowing. However, local cadres and community members, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, with the revolutionary spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, actively carried water and sowed seeds. After a struggle, they successfully completed the sowing plan on time. Many regions immediately began management after sowing, ensuring that the vast majority of cotton fields met the requirements of full and robust seedlings.

　　加强管理力争增产
　　关中地区棉花长势好
    陕西关中棉区的三百八十多万亩棉花长势很好，棉花现蕾期比去年提早十多天，有不少棉株已经结下了二至三个伏前桃。目前各地社员正在加强田间管理，力争今年棉花增产。
    今年棉花播种期间，关中地区发生了比较严重的干旱，给棉花播种带来了不少困难。但是，各地干部社员高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，以愚公移山的革命精神，积极挑水点种，经过一场斗争，终于适时完成了播种计划。许多地区在播种后立即进行管理，使绝大部分棉田达到了苗全苗壮的要求。
