Zhou Yang, the leader of the anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought literary black line, has been exposed. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

Zhou Yang's criminal activities are not limited to the literary field. Recently, according to revelations from cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants from his hometown, Zhou Yang, after liberation, also acted as a protector of landlords, pseudo-police chiefs, and rightists, becoming a supporter and participant in their criminal activities.

Zhou Yang comes from a large landlord family in Yiyang County, Hunan Province. Local cadres and masses say: Before liberation, from Xin Shicheng to Yiyang City, dozens of miles of land were all owned by the Zhou family's landlords, and Zhou Yang's family was one of the largest landlords. Zhou Yang, instead of hating such a sinister family, after liberation, repeatedly used his power to cover up his landlord family's escape from struggle and placed landlord relatives in various important positions.

Zhou Yang's elder brother, Zhou Guyi, was a landlord, a member of the Kuomintang Revival Society, a Kuomintang member, a pseudo-police chief, and a pseudo-county political director. Before liberation, he relied on his power to commit evil, collect levies, seize grain, conscript soldiers, and rape women, totaling more than thirty. In the early days of liberation, he also organized the "Seventy-Two Sages" (Zhou Guyi was a key member) with local landlord tyrants to resist the "25% rent reduction" and firmly opposed the people. To cover up this reactionary landlord from the land reform struggle, in July 1950, Zhou Yang used his power to send a telegram to the local Party committee, asking Zhou Guyi to escort his mother and sister (both landlords) to Beijing. These landlords, under Zhou Yang's protection, thus escaped the people's net.

After arriving in Beijing, Zhou Yang again used his power to arrange for Zhou Guyi to study at the North China Revolutionary University. In December of the same year, Zhou Yang's mother found it difficult to adapt to life in Beijing and wanted to return to Changsha. Zhou Yang, following his mother's orders, graduated Zhou Guyi early and escorted his mother back to Changsha. He also personally wrote a letter to the former Hunan Provincial Industrial Bureau to arrange a job for him. This pseudo-police chief thus transformed into the deputy director of the General Affairs Department of the Industrial Bureau. This hooligan often insulted women and was detained by the public security bureau multiple times.

Zhou Yang's mother lived in Changsha with Zhou Guyi. Zhou Guyi earned more than seventy yuan a month. Zhou Yang, fearing they would not live well, also sent them sixty yuan each month. Local poor and lower-middle peasants said: "He was a landlord in the past, and he is still a landlord now."

Zhou Yang's former brother-in-law, Wu Zhicheng, was a bankrupt landlord, and his wife was a current counter-revolutionary. In 1949, Wu Zhicheng fled to Beijing, and Zhou Yang arranged for him to study at the North China Revolutionary University. Later, Wu, as a member of the Southward Work Team, worked in Yueling, Chenxi, and Mayang in Hunan. In 1956, after Wu returned home, Zhou Yang wrote a letter to the Yiyang County Committee, proposing to arrange a job for Wu. The County Committee did not listen to him. Zhou Yang was very concerned about Wu and often provided economic assistance. This landlord and his counter-revolutionary wife thus lived a life of idleness without labor.

Zhou Yang also tried hard to exonerate the rightist Lin Boshen (former director of the Hunan Provincial Sun Yat-sen Library, Zhou Yang's old classmate) of his anti-Party, anti-socialist crimes. In 1957, after Lin was demoted and had his salary reduced, he harbored resentment and attempted to reverse his case. In 1958, Zhou Yang met Lin Boshen in Changsha. Lin complained to Zhou about his "wrongdoings," and Zhou Yang comforted him, saying, "Your motives are not bad, not anti-Party, anti-socialist, but the effect is not good." He also said, "It's because you don't have enough love for the youth," and invited Lin to dinner. Zhou Yang, you ask, is anti-Party, anti-socialist "motives not bad"? Are rightists just "not having enough love for the youth"? Zhou Yang's slander of the Party's anti-rightist struggle fully exposed his ugly face as an anti-Party conspirator.

Zhou Yang often corresponded with Lin Boshen. In the second half of 1962, Lin wrote a letter to Zhou Yang, expressing many "opinions" about propaganda work. Zhou Yang replied, addressing Lin as "old friend." The letter said: "I am very pleased to hear about your recent situation. You said you want to get closer to the Party and strive to become a communist, this desire for progress, I fully support it. ... You said propaganda should be suitable for the audience, this opinion is correct, ..." It turns out that Zhou Yang's "propaganda audience" was determined according to the opinions of rightists. He "supports" such rightists becoming "communists" of that type. And this rightist actually had the audacity to "discuss" Zhou Yang's "propaganda work." The true nature of Zhou Yang and his ilk's propaganda work is now fully revealed!

Chairman Mao said: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." Zhou Yang, with his actions, proved that he is a filial son and grandson of the landlord class, a thorough counter-revolutionary.

    周扬在家乡的罪恶活动
    向群
    周扬这个反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的文艺黑线的“首领”被揪出来了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    周扬的罪恶活动决不止于文艺界，最近据其家乡干部和贫下中农的揭发，周扬解放后还充当了地主分子、伪保长、右派分子的保护人，成为他们罪恶活动的支持者和参加者。
    周扬出身于湖南省益阳县一个大地主的家庭。当地干部和群众说：解放前，从新市渡到益阳市几十里路，都是周家各地主的田，而周扬家又是其中最大的地主之一。周扬对于这样一个罪恶之家，不但不痛恨，解放后，还屡次利用职权，千方百计地包庇其地主家庭逃避斗争，并且把地主亲属安插到各个重要的工作岗位。
    周扬的哥哥周谷宜，是地主分子、国民党复兴社的成员、国民党员、伪保长、伪县政指导员。解放前依仗权势，为非作恶，摊捐款，征积谷，抓壮丁，奸淫妇女达三十余人。解放初期，还伙同当地地主恶霸组织“七十二贤臣”（周谷宜是主要骨干），抵抗“二五减租”，坚决与人民为敌。周扬为了包庇这个反动的地主分子逃避土改斗争，一九五○年七月，竟利用职权，打电报给当地党委，要周谷宜护送他母亲、姐姐（都是地主分子）到北京。这些地主分子，在周扬的保护下，就这样逃出了人民的法网。
    到北京之后，周扬又利用职权，把周谷宜安排在华北革命大学学习。同年十二月，周扬的母亲在北京生活不习惯，要求回长沙。周扬秉承母命，将周谷宜提前毕业，护送其母亲回长沙；还亲自写信给前湖南省工业厅，给他安排工作。这个伪保长就这样摇身一变，成了工业厅的总务股股长。这个流氓成性的家伙，还经常侮辱妇女，受到公安局多次监禁。
    周扬的母亲随周谷宜住在长沙。周谷宜每月工资七十余元。周扬还唯恐他们生活得不好，每月又寄给他们六十元。当地贫下中农说：“他过去是地主，现在还是地主。”
    周扬前妻之弟吴之清是个破产地主，吴的老婆是个现行反革命分子。一九四九年，吴之清跑到北京，周扬把他安插在华北革命大学学习。以后，吴以南下工作队员身份，在湖南沅陵、辰溪、麻阳等地工作。一九五六年吴回家后，周扬又写信给益阳县委会，提出给吴安排工作。县委没有听他的。周扬对吴十分关心，经常给予经济援助。这个地主分子和他的反革命分子老婆，就一直过着不劳而获的生活。
    周扬还极力为反党反社会主义的右派分子林柏森（原湖南省中山图书馆馆长，周扬的老同学）开脱罪状。林在一九五七年受到撤职降薪的处分后，一直怀恨在心，妄图翻案。一九五八年，周扬在长沙接见林柏森，林向周大肆申诉自己的“冤枉”，周扬就安慰他说：“你动机不坏，不是反党反社会主义的，但效果不好。”又说：
  “是你对青年的爱护心不够”，并且请林吃饭。试问周扬，反党反社会主义难道是“动机不坏”吗？右派分子难道只是“对青年的爱护心不够”吗？周扬对党的反右派斗争的污蔑，正好暴露了他的反党野心家的丑恶嘴脸。
    周扬还经常和林柏森通信。一九六二年下半年，林写信给周扬，对宣传工作提了许多“意见”。周扬回信称林为“老友”。信中说：“来信得悉近况，十分欣慰。您说很想靠拢党，争取成为一个共产主义者，这种力求进步的愿望，我是很赞成的。……您说宣传要适合对象，这意见是对的，……”原来周扬的“宣传对象”是按照右派分子的“意见”确定的。他“赞成”这样的右派成为他们那种类型的“共产主义者”。而这个右派分子居然也大言不惭地要“讨论”周扬的“宣传工作”。周扬之流究竟搞的是什么宣传工作，这就真相大白！
    毛主席说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”周扬以自己的行动，证明了他是地主阶级的孝子贤孙，是一个道道地地的反革命派。
