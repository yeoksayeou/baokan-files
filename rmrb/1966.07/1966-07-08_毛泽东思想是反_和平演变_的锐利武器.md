	Mao Zedong Thought is a Sharp Weapon Against "Peaceful Evolution"
	Student Mu Zhenkui, Class 1, Grade 3, Henan Province, Xuchang First High School

	Editor's Note: On July 2, the Communist Youth League of Henan Province held an award ceremony in Xuchang, conferring the title of "Model Youth League Member" on Mu Zhenkui, a student from Xuchang First High School and a member of the Communist Youth League from a poor peasant family. Mu Zhenkui wrote an article titled "Mao Zedong Thought is a Sharp Weapon Against 'Peaceful Evolution.'" The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League added a commentary, which is reproduced in full below:

	Comrade Mu Zhenkui is a model for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We hope that all young members of the Communist Youth League and young people will learn from him.

	Learn from him how to firmly regard Mao Zedong Thought as the highest directive, using Mao Zedong Thought as a political telescope and microscope to carefully distinguish between flowers and weeds, bravely fight against ghosts and monsters, and fight against bourgeois and revisionist thoughts. Actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Learn from him how to resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, under the leadership of the Party, and skillfully follow the Party's policies to unite the vast majority of the masses, including those who have different opinions, and organize the youth in your unit into a strong fighting collective against the bourgeois "peaceful evolution."

	Learn from him how to firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, strictly demand of oneself, constantly transform one's thoughts, be modest and prudent, and engage in self-criticism. Gradually establish a proletarian worldview in the struggle.

	Mu Zhenkui's class, Class 1, Grade 3, of Xuchang First High School, is a model "Four-Good" class. All classes should learn from this class, making the Communist Youth League a school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, firmly planting the roots of Mao Zedong Thought in the minds of young people, uprooting the roots of revisionism, and promoting the proletarianization of young people.

	In our school, the Party and Chairman Mao want to cultivate us into reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, while the bourgeoisie is desperately trying to make us undergo "peaceful evolution" and become successors to the bourgeoisie. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over the next generation is an important part of the class struggle throughout the socialist period. Here, I will recount the experience of our class's Youth League branch and class committee, under the leadership of the school's Party branch and Youth League committee, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight against the revisionist views of our class teacher. This was a struggle between "peaceful evolution" and anti-"peaceful evolution."

	In late August 1964, the new school year began. We started our second year. We heard that the new class teacher was a very "remarkable" person, and his previous class was a "Red Flag Class." We were all very happy. Little did we know that the contradictions began to surface from the first meeting he called with the cadre members. That day, after lunch, he called us a few class cadres to discuss what work should be done in the new school year and how to do it. At that time, we had already started studying Chairman Mao's works, and I proposed, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, that "this year we should first focus on class struggle." To my suggestions, the class teacher seemed not to have heard at all. I only saw him frown and suddenly change the subject, talking about his "cadre policy." He said: "I have very strict requirements for cadres, if cadres do not set an example, I will not be lenient..." After his speech, he did not give anyone a chance to speak and immediately dispersed the meeting! The next day, we few cadre students held a meeting, and everyone reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on never forgetting class struggle. We unanimously agreed that whether or not to engage in class struggle is a fundamental difference between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. From then on, we became vigilant against him.

	Did this class teacher really not engage in class struggle? Not at all. On the surface, he avoided talking about class struggle, but in reality, he always stood on the bourgeois standpoint, desperately engaging in class struggle with the proletariat to seize the youth.

	The first time he met with all the students in our class, he eagerly pushed his revisionist goods, trying to deceive us into taking the path of individual struggle. He told the students: "One's own path must be paved by oneself. Now pave the path well, it will be convenient in the future, otherwise, you will regret it!" He often boasted: "I am a new official with three fires." This is the "first fire" he wanted to set as our class teacher. Is this a flower or a weed? At first, we could not distinguish between them. To find the answer, we all simultaneously turned to Chairman Mao's works. Among the six criteria set by Chairman Mao for distinguishing between flowers and weeds, the most important are two. One of them is "beneficial to consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party, rather than escaping or weakening this leadership." I thought, this class teacher openly incited us to take the bourgeois path of individual struggle. Isn't this inciting us to break away from the Party's leadership? It meets the condition of being a weed! At this time, we immediately held a meeting of the branch committee, and everyone unanimously agreed that he was spreading poison! We reported the situation to the Party branch and the Youth League committee. According to the instructions of the Party branch and the Youth League committee, we organized the class to criticize his reactionary views and organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's important statements on the Party's leadership. Through study and discussion, we loved the Party and Chairman Mao even more. Everyone said: We must listen to the Party and follow Chairman Mao, and we will never take the path of individual struggle. In this way, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we extinguished his "first fire."

	Soon, the mid-term exam was approaching, and he came to tell everyone: "You can study as much as you want, as long as you are not politically reactionary, mastering knowledge can serve the people!" And he introduced a set of "good experiences" of rote learning. Due to the long-term cultivation and education of the Party, especially the Party branch's serious organization of everyone to study Chairman Mao's works after the start of the school year, we began to have a certain ability to distinguish between flowers and weeds. This time, his trick was exposed by most of the students. At that time, I thought, he said "as long as you are not politically reactionary," isn't this saying: "Do we still need revolutionization? Do we still need to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought? Do we still need to insist on anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, aid the liberation struggle of the oppressed people? Do we still need to uproot revisionism and prevent bourgeois restoration? As long as you are not reactionary, it's fine." Isn't this advocating class cooperation? A person who does not listen to the Party, is only professional and not red, and even engages in class cooperation with the enemy, how can they talk about serving the people?

	To thoroughly criticize his fallacy, after the branch committee's research, we organized the class to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" such as "strengthening ideological and political work" and "without a correct political viewpoint, it is like having no soul," and we held discussions. In this way, the "white specialist" road was made stinky, and the political atmosphere was made thick. This class teacher's "second fire" was also burned in vain.

	This class teacher was very cunning. He knew that Mao Zedong Thought was our most powerful weapon to counter him, so he was very hostile to our study of Chairman Mao's works and tried every means to obstruct us from mastering Mao Zedong Thought. At the beginning of the school year, we seriously implemented the spirit of the Ninth National Congress of the Communist Youth League, and the enthusiasm of the students to study Chairman Mao's works was unprecedented. At this time, he hurriedly said: "Chairman Mao's works can be studied when there is time, and when there is no time, it's fine." His obstruction not only did not shake our resolve to study Chairman Mao's works but also made us understand a truth: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." Summarizing the past experience of struggle, we loved Chairman Mao's books even more, and our enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works was even greater.

	To improve everyone's class consciousness and combat capability, we organized everyone to study the important statements in Chairman Mao's works on the importance of studying Marxism-Leninism, such as, "Our vision is not enough, we should use telescopes and microscopes." We organized discussions on "How to become a true Marxist-Leninist?" When reading the newspaper, we tried to find editorials and advanced experiences related to studying Chairman Mao's works. We immediately praised students who studied well in the class. In this way, everyone further realized that to become a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause, one must strive to study Chairman Mao's works. In a short time, a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works was set off in the class. We bought many single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works, set up a small desk for Chairman Mao's works. Everyone took action, copying Chairman Mao's quotations word by word. A few students even brought "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" from home for everyone to study. As long as we could buy Chairman Mao's books, we bought them. In the past, when we went to the countryside to labor, we carried textbooks and playing cards; at this time, when we went to the countryside to labor, almost everyone carried a few books of Chairman Mao's works. Each student ordered a notebook for studying Chairman Mao's works and insisted on taking notes. Whoever did anything against Chairman Mao's teachings was resolutely resisted. At that time, someone recommended "Yanshan Night Talks" to us and said it was a "good book." We took a look (Volume 3), and the first article "Poor in Spirit, Not Poor in Spirit" was completely contrary to Chairman Mao's teaching of "poverty leads to change, to do, to revolution." What nonsense about "respecting the spirit of the poor ghosts in the 'Biography of the Poor' with reverence"! What nonsense about "promoting the positive spirit of being poor in spirit but not poor in spirit"! It made people sick. Everyone said: "This is a bad book, it makes people feel sick." So we didn't look at it anymore (at that time, we had not yet exposed the enemy's political plots). During the Chinese language class, when discussing "how to evaluate 'The Song of Youth,'" everyone immediately used Chairman Mao's article "The Direction of the Youth Movement" as a weapon to firmly criticize the author's fallacy that many young intellectuals had completed their ideological transformation through various tests other than integrating with workers and peasants. Some teachers said: "He is an 'authority'!" The students said: "Who cares about the 'authority'! We do not allow anyone who opposes Mao Zedong Thought."

	At this time, our class teacher, seeing that it was impossible to obstruct us from studying Chairman Mao's works, then used another trick, which was to destroy the unity of our class.

	He knew that to carry out "peaceful evolution" in our class, he must first control the Youth League branch and the class committee. At the beginning of the school year, he always smiled at the cadres, and when talking to the cadres, he "consulted" and "consulted" again, always trying to get a "good" result. However, for principle issues, we would not give in to him, and we were not afraid to quarrel with him. At this time, he knew that he could not control this cadre team, so he plotted to destroy us. He sowed discord among the cadres, creating rifts. He called me to say how bad the class monitor He Xiuqi and others were, and he called He Xiuqi to say bad things about me, and he called the organizational committee member, and he called the propaganda committee member... In this way, he created mutual complaints among the cadres, and some even wanted to write a resignation letter and quit. To solve the problem, we also held a life meeting once, trying to solve it, but because of mutual complaints, the meeting broke up, the contradictions became greater, and we dispersed unhappily.

	This made the class teacher very happy, and he openly incited dissatisfaction with the class cadres among the students. He told the students: "Our class cadres are not good, look at what they are like!" He did not consult us for work but consulted others.

	What should we do? There were three paths in front of us: one was to surrender and collude with the enemy; one was to give up and let him do as he pleased; one was to reorganize the team, unite, and fight to the end. The first path is that of a traitor, the second path is that of a deserter, and only the third path is what the Party needs. Chairman Mao said: "The world belongs to you. The future of China belongs to you." The Party and Chairman Mao have such great expectations and trust in us! We must not disappoint the Party, and we must not disappoint Chairman Mao! How can we surrender to the class enemy! If we really did that, it would be so shameful! We resolutely chose the path of firmly fighting against revisionist thoughts.

	Without unity, we cannot fight. But how can we achieve unity? Chairman Mao said, "Starting from the desire for unity, through criticism or struggle, resolve contradictions, and thus achieve new unity on a new basis." How can we make everyone "start from the desire for unity"? We accepted the lesson of the previous "unhappy dispersal," and after the branch committee's research, we decided not to rush to hold a meeting but suggested that everyone first study the relevant teachings on maintaining the Party's unity, consolidating the Party's unity; serving the people wholeheartedly; criticism and self-criticism, and some chapters in "On the Cultivation of Communist Party Members" and the Ninth National Congress documents. A few weeks later, we held a life meeting together, and everyone made self-criticisms. I first examined myself, and the class monitor He Xiuqi also made self-criticisms. Then, let everyone put their difficulties out, and put their questions out, and absolutely do not blindly criticize others, nor hint at others. Such a meeting was held about three or four times. We exposed the class teacher's plots and tricks, and thus united tightly again to face new battles!

	Not long after, the mid-term exam began. At this time, the class teacher played a new trick, insisting that we set targets before the exam and evaluate scores after the exam. The whole class unanimously opposed it. Yan Zhenhu pointed out sharply: "This is a stimulus for fame and profit." "Those who do not perform well will be dejected, and those who perform well will be arrogant. We will not do it!" But some cadres hesitated a bit, feeling that we should also "consider the teacher's face a bit!" What should we do? We again reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: "The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview." After studying, everyone unanimously agreed that even if we quarrel with him, we must not transform the world according to the bourgeois worldview! Thus, the cadres took the lead in making mutual agreements, not setting targets, and not comparing scores.

	This class teacher saw that sowing discord and other tricks were not only unsuccessful but also backfired. At this time, he was really cornered, and his ugly face was completely exposed. He flew into a rage and said: "I have long been unwilling to be your class teacher, if you want me to be one again, I must be given power!" What "power"? It is the "power" to transform us according to the bourgeois worldview, the "power" to carry out "peaceful evolution" on us! The Party gave him the power to serve the people, but he did not want it, and he had the audacity to want the "power" to carry out "peaceful evolution" on us. Who will give it to him? No one will!

	Thus, this new class teacher's "three fires" only burned two, and after the mid-term exam, his "third fire" did not have time to burn and was "dismissed." Under the strong demand of the students in our class, the school leadership removed his position as class teacher.

	Looking back at this struggle, we deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is our invincible and sharpest weapon to resist "peaceful evolution" and defeat all ghosts and monsters. Mao Zedong Thought is the source of all our strength! During the time we fought against the class teacher, we almost sang every day: "The East is red, the sun rises, China has given birth to Mao Zedong..." and "...listen to the Party's words" these two songs. We felt that with the Party and Chairman Mao supporting us, all ghosts and monsters would be thoroughly eliminated!

	Throughout the socialist period, the struggle against "peaceful evolution" and anti-"peaceful evolution" is long-term, tortuous, and complex, manifesting in various aspects. The above narration is only a small part of the story of "peaceful evolution" and anti-"peaceful evolution" in our class, just one aspect. Our struggle with the class teacher is not just what was mentioned above. Dismissing the class teacher's position, the struggle did not end.

	Chairman Mao said: The successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggle of the masses and grow in the tempering of revolutionary storms and waves. The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a mass struggle, a revolutionary storm and wave. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. In the struggle, we will cultivate and temper ourselves into reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	Long live the Communist Party of China!
	Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!
	Long live our beloved teacher, Chairman Mao!

    毛泽东思想是反“和平演变”的锐利武器
    河南许昌第一高中学生　　慕振奎
    编者按：共青团河南省委七月二日在许昌举行授奖大会，授予许昌第一高中学生、贫农出身的共青团员慕振奎“模范共青团员”的称号。慕振奎写了一篇题为《毛泽东思想是反“和平演变”的锐利武器》的文章。共青团中央加了按语，按语全文如下：
    慕振奎同志，是共青团员活学活用毛主席著作的一个标兵。我们希望广大共青团员和青年，都来向他学习。
    学习他坚定地把毛泽东思想当作最高指示，用毛泽东思想这个政治上的望远镜和显微镜，认真地辨别什么是香花，什么是毒草，勇敢地同牛鬼蛇神作斗争，同资产阶级、修正主义思想作斗争，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命。
    学习他坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，在党的领导下，善于按照党的政策，团结绝大多数群众，包括和自己有不同意见的同志，把自己所在单位的青年群众团结起来，成为反对资产阶级“和平演变”的坚强的战斗集体。
    学习他牢牢记住毛主席的教导，严格要求自己，不断改造思想，谦虚谨慎，进行自我批评，在斗争中逐步确立无产阶级世界观。
    慕振奎所在的河南许昌第一高中三年级一班团支部，是一个“四好”团支部的标兵。所有团支部，都要向这个团支部学习，把共青团办成活学活用毛泽东思想的学校，在青年的头脑中牢牢地扎下毛泽东思想的根子，挖掉修正主义的根子，促进青年无产阶级革命化。
    在我们学校里，党和毛主席要把我们培养成为可靠的无产阶级革命事业接班人，而资产阶级却拚命要使我们“和平演变”，成为资产阶级的接班人。无产阶级和资产阶级争夺下一代的斗争，是整个社会主义时期阶级斗争的一个重要组成部分。这里，我要叙述的是一年前我们班团支部和班委会在学校党支部和团委会的领导下，以毛泽东思想为武器，与我们班主任的修正主义观点作斗争的经过。这是一场“和平演变”与反“和平演变”的斗争。
    一九六四年八月底，开学了。我们开始上二年级。听说新班主任是个很“了不起”的人物，过去他抓的班是“红旗班”，我们都很高兴。哪里想到，从第一次他召开的干部会起，矛盾就暴露出来了。那天饭后，他把我们几个班干部喊去，叫谈谈在新学年里“应该抓哪些工作？”“怎么个抓法？”我们当时已经开始学习毛主席著作，我就按毛主席的教导，提出了“这一学年首先要狠抓阶级斗争”的意见。对于我的这些意见，班主任好象根本没听见，只见他皱了皱眉头，突然转了话题，讲起他的“干部政策”来了。他说：“我对干部要求最严，干部不以身作则，我可不客气……。”他的议论发完了，也不给大家张嘴的机会就下令散会！第二天，我们几个干部同学开了个碰头会，大家重新温习了毛主席关于千万不要忘记阶级斗争的教导。一致认为，搞不搞阶级斗争，这是马克思列宁主义和修正主义的一个根本分歧。从此我们就对他提高了警惕。
    这位班主任是不是就真的不抓阶级斗争了呢？不，全不是这样，表面上避谈阶级斗争，而其实他总是站在资产阶级立场上，拚命地搞同无产阶级进行争夺青年的阶级斗争。
    他第一次和我们全班同学见面，就迫不及待地推销修正主义的黑货，他想骗我们走个人奋斗的绝路。他对同学们说：“自己的路要自己来铺，现在把路铺好，将来自己方便，不然，会后悔的！”他屡次扬言：“我是新官上任三把火。”这就是他来当我们的班主任要放的“第一把火”。这是香花还是毒草呢？开始我们还辨别不清，为了找到答案，我们都不约而同地翻起毛主席著作来。毛主席制定的区别香花和毒草的六条标准之中，最重要的是两条，其中一条就是“有利于巩固共产党的领导，而不是摆脱或者削弱这种领导”。我想，这位班主任公然引诱我们走资产阶级个人奋斗的死路，这不是煽动我们脱离党的领导吗？够上毒草的条件了！这时，我们团支委就马上开了个碰头会，大家一致认为他是在放毒！我们向党支部和团委会汇报了情况，根据党支部和团委会的指示，我们在班上组织同学批判了他的这种反动论点，并且组织大家一起反复学习毛主席有关党的领导的重要论述。通过学习讨论，我们更加热爱党，热爱毛主席。大家都说：我们一定听党的话，跟毛主席走，决不走个人奋斗的死路。就这样，我们在毛泽东思想的指导下，扑灭了他的“第一把火”。
    快段中考试了，他跑来对大家说：“你们读书，尽管读，只要政治上不反动，把知识学到手，就能为人民服务！”并且介绍了一大套死读书的“好经验”。由于党的长期培养和教育，特别由于开学之后党支部认真地组织大家学习毛主席著作，使得我们开始具备了一定的识别香花和毒草的能力，这次他的诡计一露头就被大多数同学看穿了。当时，我想，他说“在政治上只要不反动”，这岂不是说：“还要什么革命化？还学马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想干什么？还坚持什么反帝反修、援助被压迫人民的解放斗争？还搞什么挖掉修正主义根子，防止资产阶级复辟？只要不反动就行了。”这难道不是在宣扬阶级合作？一个不听党的话，只专不红，甚至同敌人搞阶级合作的人，怎么能谈得上为人民服务？
    为了狠狠地批判他这种谬论，经过支委会研究，我们在班上组织大家反复学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中“加强思想政治工作”和“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”等教导，并且展开讨论。这样，“白专道路”被搞得臭臭的，政治空气被搞得浓浓的。这位班主任的“第二把火”也就白烧了。
    这位班主任是很狡猾的，他知道，毛泽东思想是我们反击他的最厉害的武器，所以他就非常仇视我们学习毛主席著作，千方百计阻碍我们掌握毛泽东思想。开学初，我们认真贯彻了共青团“九大”精神，同学们学习毛主席著作的热情空前高涨。正在这个时候，他慌慌张张地跑来说：“毛主席著作有空可以学，没空就算了。”他的阻拦不但没有动摇我们学习毛主席著作的决心，反而使我们更加明白了这样一个真理：就是“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。总结以往的斗争经验，我们更加热爱毛主席的书，学习毛主席著作的劲头更大了。
    为了提高大家的阶级觉悟和作战能力，我们组织大家学习毛主席著作中有关学习马克思列宁主义的重要性的论述，比如，“我们的眼力不够，应该借助于望远镜和显微镜。”组织大家讨论“怎样才能成为真正的马克思列宁主义者？”读报时也尽量找有关学习毛主席著作的社论和先进经验。发现班内学得好的同学，马上表扬。这样，大家进一步认识到，要成为无产阶级革命事业接班人，就必须努力学习毛主席著作。很短的时间里，就在班上掀起了一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。我们买了许多毛主席著作单行本，办起了毛主席著作小书桌。大家动手，一字一句地抄写毛主席语录。有几位同学还从家里拿来了《毛泽东选集》供大家学习。只要能买到的毛主席的书，我们都买了。在过去，下乡劳动拿的是课本、扑克等；这时，下乡劳动，几乎人人都带了几本毛主席著作。每个同学都订了学习毛主席著作笔记本，坚持了记笔记。无论谁做什么事，违背毛主席教导的都被坚决抵制。当时有人向我们推荐《燕山夜话》，并说是本“好书”。我们拿来一本（第三集）一看，第一篇《人穷志不穷》就与毛主席“穷则思变，要干，要革命”的教导格格不入，什么要向《贫士传》中的死魂的骨气“肃然起敬”呀！什么“发扬人穷志不穷的积极精神”呀！看了令人发呕。大家说：“这是本坏书，看了叫人恶心。”就不再看了（当时我们还没有识破敌人的政治阴谋）。语文课上讲到“怎样评价《青春之歌》”时，大家当堂就以毛主席《青年运动的方向》这篇文章为武器，对作者的所谓许多知识青年是“通过了同工农结合以外的各种各样的考验”完成了思想改造的谬论，进行了坚决的批评。有的老师说：“人家是‘权威’人士！”同学们说：“管他什么‘权威’！谁反对毛泽东思想我们都不允许。”
    这时，我们的班主任，见到要阻碍我们学习毛主席著作不可能，于是又使出他的另外一招，就是破坏我们班的团结。
    他知道，要在我们班推行“和平演变”，必须首先控制团支部和班委会。刚开学时，他对干部总是笑脸相待，和干部谈话是“商量”再“商量”，总想讨个“好”。但是，对于原则问题，我们决不向他让步，不怕与他翻脸。这时，他知道我们这个干部班子控制不住，就阴谋搞垮我们。他在干部中挑拨离间，制造隔阂。把我喊去说班长郝秀奇等如何如何不好，把郝秀奇喊去又说我的坏话，把组织委员喊去……，把宣传委员喊去……。这样搞来搞去，弄得干部之间互相埋怨，有的甚至干脆要写申请书不干了。为了解决问题，我们也曾开过一次生活会，试图解决，但是，由于互相埋怨，会议开崩了，矛盾更大，不欢而散。
    这一来班主任可高兴透啦，便在同学中间公开煽动对班干部的不满。他对同学们说：“咱这班干部就不中，你看着啥味！”有工作也不肯找我们商量，而找另外一些人去商量。
    怎么办？摆在我们面前的有三条道路：一条是投降，与敌人同流合污；一条是放弃不干，让他随意搞去；一条是整顿队伍，团结起来，战斗到底。走第一条路是叛徒，走第二条路是逃兵，走第三条路才是党所需要的。毛主席说：“世界是属于你们的。中国的前途是属于你们的。”党和毛主席对我们寄托多么大的期望和信任啊！我们决不能辜负党，决不能辜负毛主席！我们怎么能在阶级敌人面前屈服！如果真是那样，该是多么可耻！我们坚决地选择了与修正主义思想坚决斗争的道路。
    没有团结就不能战斗。但是，怎么才能达到团结的目的呢？毛主席说，要“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争使矛盾得到解决，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结。”怎样才能使每个人都能“从团结的愿望出发”呢？我们接受了上次“不欢而散”的教训，经过支委会研究，决定不再急于开会，而是建议大家先学习有关维护党的团结，巩固党的统一；全心全意为人民服务；批评和自我批评等论述，和《论共产党员的修养》、团“九大”文件中的某些章节。几周之后，我们在一起开生活会，大家都作自我批评。我首先检查了自己，班长郝秀奇也作了自我批评。然后让每个人把自己的难处摆出来，把疑问都说出来，而绝不盲目批评别人，也不影射别人。这样的会大约开了三四次。我们揭穿了班主任的阴谋诡计，从而又紧紧地团结了起来，迎接新的战斗！
    没有多久，段中考试开始了。这时，班主任又施出了新花招，他非叫我们考前订指标，考后搞分数评比不可。全班同学一致反对。阎振虎同学尖锐地指出：“这是名利刺激。”“考得不好了垂头丧气，考得好了趾高气扬。坚决不搞！”但是，也有少数干部有点犹豫，觉得也得“照顾点儿老师的面子呀！”怎么办？我们又重新学习了毛主席的教导。毛主席说：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”学习之后，大家一致认为，哪怕与他翻脸也决不能按照资产阶级世界观改造世界！于是干部带头互相约定，不订指标，不比分数。
    这位班主任眼看挑拨离间等都不仅不成功，反而适得其反。这个时候，他真是图穷匕首现，可恶的嘴脸彻底暴露出来了。他大发雷霆说：“我早就不想当你们的班主任了，要想再叫我当，非得给我权力不可！”
    什么“权力”呢？就是按照资产阶级世界观改造我们的“权力”，就是在我们身上搞“和平演变”的“权力”！党给他为人民服务的权力他不要，却异想天开地要向我们搞“和平演变”的“权力”，谁给呢？没人给！
    于是，这位新班主任的“三把火”才烧了两把，段中考试后，他的“第三把火”没来得及烧，就被“罢了官”。在我们班同学们的强烈要求下，学校领导撤销了他的班主任职务。
    回顾这场斗争，我们深深体会到，毛泽东思想是我们抵制“和平演变”、战胜一切牛鬼蛇神的战无不胜的最锐利的武器。毛泽东思想，是我们一切力量的源泉！在与班主任作斗争的那一段时间里，我们几乎天天高唱：“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”和“……听话要听党的话”这两支歌子。我们觉得，有党和毛主席为我们撑腰，什么牛鬼蛇神都将被彻底消灭！
    在整个社会主义时期，“和平演变”和反“和平演变”的斗争是长期的、曲折的、复杂的，表现于各个方面。上面叙述的，只是在我们班“和平演变”与反“和平演变”斗争的一小段故事，只是一个侧面。我们与班主任的斗争也不只是上面说的那些，罢了班主任的官，斗争也并没有结束。
    毛主席说：无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。当前的无产阶级文化大革命，就是群众斗争，就是革命的大风大浪，我们一定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，在斗争中把自己培养锻炼成长为坚强可靠的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们亲爱的导师毛主席万岁！
