The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 26th, severely protesting the recent escalation of fascist atrocities by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces against overseas Chinese in Aceh.

The note listed numerous extremely serious anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese incidents in Aceh.

On the night of June 26, 1966, right-wing thugs in Lengsau, East Aceh, armed with iron bars, axes, and other weapons, crazily attacked Chinese shops and residences. Many doors and windows were smashed, walls were broken, and store equipment was destroyed. From June 27 to July 3, over several consecutive nights, the thugs created horrifying fascist terror in the Chinese residential areas, harassing them all night. Many thugs covered their faces with cloth, shouting and screaming, breaking into doors, and brutally beating and humiliating the Chinese, sparing no one, including the elderly and women. More than 50 Chinese were beaten and injured, including a 70-year-old Chinese elder, Ye Xizhan, who was severely beaten and could not stand; another Chinese, Dai Shunchuan, was severely injured and thrown into a sewer, and the thugs poured sewage into his mouth.

The note pointed out: After the thugs' rampage, the local authorities in Lengsau hurriedly convened a meeting with the Chinese on July 4. Attendees included the commander of the 11th Military Subdistrict of the 1st Military Region, the head of East Aceh, and the police chief. They shamelessly claimed that the fascist atrocities committed by a small group of hooligans they had instigated were "the people's anger against the Chinese"; they openly threatened the Chinese again, saying, "Leave Lengsau immediately, or your safety will not be guaranteed."

In Kuala Nongsa, right-wing thugs recently colluded with Chiang Kai-shek's gangsters led by Lin Shaolan and Yu Beifu to threaten the Chinese to leave the area by August 1. Every time the thugs went out to harass, they could receive food and money from the gangsters. On the night of July 2, thugs knocked on the doors of the Chinese, dragged them out, and beat them. Some thugs, driven by bestial instincts, forced the Chinese to "run" and "jump" with sharp weapons, forced Chinese women to stand in the rain, and then molested and humiliated them after they were soaked.

On June 23, right-wing thugs in North Aceh's Merun colluded with local Chiang Kai-shek gangsters Zhang Yanheng, Ye Yinglin, and Rao Bingchun to abduct 25 Chinese, including the president of the local Chinese Association and other Chinese. They humiliated them physically, paraded them through the streets, and then took them to the local military command. The military commander shamelessly claimed that the actions of the thugs and the gangsters "represented the will of the people" and further threatened the local Chinese to leave the country by August.

The Chinese in Banda Aceh, Merauke, Dabai, and Perak have also recently suffered similar persecution from right-wing reactionary forces. After the Chinese in the above areas suffered severe mental threats, the local military and political authorities instructed the gangsters to spread lies, deceiving the Chinese into giving up their Chinese nationality and becoming "stateless," claiming that "this way they would not be tortured and would be allowed to stay," attempting to make the Chinese become orphans without a country and be slaughtered by the right-wing reactionary forces. Due to the continuous and relentless persecution over the past three months, thousands of Chinese in Aceh have lost their homes and livelihoods, and hundreds have painfully left the places where they have lived for generations, facing imminent disaster.

The note sternly pointed out, "The Chinese Embassy has sent two notes to the Indonesian government regarding the continuous persecution and expulsion of Chinese in Aceh, demanding immediate measures to stop it. However, you have ignored this or tried to evade responsibility. Even after our note on June 27, the atrocities not only did not stop but became more severe and intensified. This clearly shows that you are the culprits behind this series of fascist atrocities, and all these atrocities are inseparable from your escalating anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese conspiracies. The Embassy expresses great indignation and severely protests to the Indonesian government."

The note said: "The Chinese Embassy reaffirms that your forced expulsion of Chinese in Aceh is a blatant act of racism. You instruct right-wing thugs to act as henchmen and openly use the gangsters as tools to persecute and torture the Chinese in an inhumane manner, which is naked fascism. The Chinese in Aceh have the legal right to reside there and should be protected by the local authorities. They have lived there for generations, always getting along harmoniously with the local people, and have played a beneficial role in the local social and economic life. Your reckless destruction and arbitrary persecution not only grossly trample on the norms of international relations and the relevant treaties between the two countries on the issue of overseas Chinese, but also completely violate the will and fundamental interests of the Indonesian people."

The note said: "Currently, Aceh is under blockade, and you attempt to further persecute the Chinese there behind closed doors without allowing the victims to appeal. This is in vain; you brazenly create racist atrocities but try to cover up the truth and evade the condemnation of world public opinion, which is absolutely impossible. We firmly demand that you immediately stop the savage persecution of Chinese nationwide, immediately stop the unreasonable forced relocation in Aceh, and compensate the Chinese for their losses and ensure their safety. You must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by the rampant anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities in Aceh and throughout the country."

### 我驻印度尼西亚大使馆照会印尼外交部  最严重抗议印尼右派在亚齐地区迫害华侨  指出印尼政府是法西斯暴行的祸首必须承担全部责任

    我驻印度尼西亚大使馆照会印尼外交部
    最严重抗议印尼右派在亚齐地区迫害华侨
    指出印尼政府是法西斯暴行的祸首必须承担全部责任
    新华社三十日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆二十六日照会印度尼西亚外交部，就印度尼西亚右派反动势力最近在亚齐地区继续加剧迫害华侨的法西斯暴行，提出最严重的抗议。
    照会列举了亚齐地区反华、排华的许多极端严重的事件。
    一九六六年六月二十六日午夜，东亚齐县冷沙的右派暴徒，手持铁条、斧头等凶器，疯狂袭击华侨商店和住宅，许多门窗被打碎，板壁被打烂，店内设备被破坏。在六月二十七日到七月三日接连的几个晚上，暴徒们制造骇人听闻的法西斯恐怖，在华侨居住区彻夜骚扰，许多暴徒用布蒙面，狂喊乱叫，撞开门户，横蛮殴打和侮辱华侨，连老弱妇孺也不放过，被殴打受伤的华侨竟达五十多人。其中一位七十高龄的华侨老人叶喜展，被殴打重伤，以致不能站立；华侨戴顺传受重伤倒地，暴徒还不罢休，又把他推进污水沟里，并用污水灌他。
    照会指出：暴徒行凶过后，冷沙的地方当局又于七月四日赶忙召集华侨“训话”，出席的有第一军区第○一一军分区司令、东亚齐县长和警察长等负责官员，他们恬不知耻地把由他们指使的一小撮流氓败类所干出来的这一法西斯暴行，说成是“人民对华侨愤怒的热潮”；公然再一次威胁华侨，要“从速离开冷沙，否则安全不予保障”。
    在瓜拉新邦，右派暴徒近来不断串同以林少兰、余北富为首的蒋匪帮分子，威吓华侨必须在今年八月一日前离开当地。暴徒每出动骚扰一次，都可以从蒋匪帮分子那里领取饮食和钞票。七月二日深夜，暴徒到处敲打华侨门户，把华侨拉出门外，拳打脚踢。有些暴徒竟兽性大发，用利器迫使华侨“跑步”和“跳跃”，强迫华侨妇女集中在大雨中罚站，并在她们被淋得透湿后进行调戏和侮辱。
    六月二十三日，北亚齐美仑的右派暴徒勾结当地蒋匪帮分子张衍兴、叶英粦、饶并春等人，抓走当地华侨总会理事和其他华侨共二十五人，对他们进行人身侮辱，并强押着游街，然后把他们带往当地驻军司令部，而驻军负责人居然厚颜无耻地宣称，暴徒和蒋匪帮分子的行为“代表了人民意愿”，还进一步威胁当地华侨在今年八月前离境。
    班达·亚齐、美拉务、达巴端、勃叻等地的华侨，最近期间也遭到右派反动势力类似的迫害。上述地区的华侨精神上受到严重威胁后，地方军政当局又指使蒋匪帮分子四出活动，欺骗华侨放弃中华人民共和国国籍，改成“无国籍”，说什么“这样便可以不受折磨，允许居留”，妄图使华侨沦为没有祖国的孤儿，并由右派反动势力宰割。由于三个月以来疯狂和接连不断的迫害，目前亚齐地区已经有华侨数千人倾家荡产，丧失生计，数百人忍痛离开了世代居住的地方，濒于绝境。
    照会严正指出，“中国大使馆就亚齐地区接连发生的迫害和驱逐华侨的暴行，曾两次照会印度尼西亚政府，要求立即采取措施予以制止，但你们对此置之不理，或者力图抵赖，就是在我们六月二十七日的照会送出之后，上述暴行不仅未能停止，反而变本加厉，愈演愈烈。这就清楚地表明了：你们是这一系列法西斯暴行的祸首，所有这些暴行都是和你们正在加剧着的反华、排华阴谋活动分不开的。大使馆对此表示难以抑制的愤慨，特向印度尼西亚政府提出最严重的抗议。”
    照会说：“中国大使馆在此重申：你们在亚齐地区强迫华侨离境，是十足的种族主义暴行，你们指使右派暴徒充当打手，并公然利用蒋匪帮作爪牙，对华侨进行非人的迫害和虐待，是赤裸裸的法西斯行径。亚齐地区的华侨有合法居留的不可剥夺的权利，并且理应受到地方当局的保护，他们世世代代居住在那里，和当地人民一贯和睦相处，在当地社会经济生活上起了有益的作用。你们这样胡作妄为，任意摧残，不仅最粗暴地践踏了国际关系准则和两国有关侨民问题的条约，而且完全违背了印度尼西亚人民的意愿和根本利益。”
    照会说：“目前亚齐地区对外已加以封锁，你们企图在那里关起门来进一步迫害华侨，而不让受害的华侨进行申诉，这是枉费心机的；你们肆无忌惮地制造种族主义暴行，却妄想掩盖真相，逃避世界正义舆论的谴责，这是绝对办不到的。我们坚决要求你们立即停止在全国各地对华侨的野蛮迫害，立即停止在亚齐地区的无理迫迁，并且赔偿华侨损失，保障华侨安全。你们必须对亚齐地区以及全国各地疯狂反华、排华所引起的一切后果承担全部责任。”
