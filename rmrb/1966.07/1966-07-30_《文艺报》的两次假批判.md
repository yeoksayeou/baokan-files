Since the founding of the nation, the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary black line led by Zhou Yang has controlled many literary organizations, literary groups, and literary publications. They have actively created public opinion to realize the restoration of capitalism. The Literary Gazette is one of their powerful tools, a company that manufactures and distributes bourgeois and revisionist literary fallacies, and a forward outpost for their attacks on the Party and socialism. Through his trusted followers and disciples in the Literary Gazette, Zhou Yang has turned it into a bastion of the landlord-bourgeoisie. For many years, the Literary Gazette has waved the black flag, closely coordinating with the attacks of domestic and foreign class enemies. They have gathered a large number of demons and monsters, actively inciting them to take action, and fervently promoting a whole set of bourgeois, modern revisionist literary lines. They have committed serious crimes against the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought.

After the great proletarian cultural revolution was launched with great fanfare, the Literary Gazette, controlled by the Zhou Yang gang, changed tactics. They engaged in fake criticism and real protection, fake revolution and real resistance, fighting and retreating, stubbornly resisting the proletarian cultural revolution initiated and led by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

Now, let us expose a great conspiracy and a great deception!

The Dalian Conference: An Organized, Planned Counter-Revolutionary Black Meeting

Everyone still remembers that in the August-September 1964 combined issue of the Literary Gazette, they published "Materials on 'Writing Intermediate Characters'" and the editorial article "Writing Intermediate Characters' is a Bourgeois Literary Proposal." Long articles and large blocks of text, one after the other, caused a sensation.

What kind of criticism was this?

This was a showy, fake criticism.

This was a grand deception.

"Writing Intermediate Characters" was systematically proposed by Shao Qianlin at the Dalian Creative Conference in August 1962. However, this conference was not just about Shao Qianlin and a literary proposal; it was a thorough anti-Party, anti-socialist black meeting, a "Petofi Club"-style gathering.

The Dalian Conference was held under the banner of discussing "creative work," but it was engaged in anti-Party, anti-socialist activities. Zhou Yang was the ringleader of the Dalian Conference, while Shao Qianlin and others were active organizers of the conference.

The Dalian Conference was held just before the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. At that time, as the Party Central Committee pointed out, "Whether in the countryside or in the cities, our economic situation is improving day by day." "Our future is bright." Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of the people and cadres, holding high the three red banners, have overcome numerous difficulties and are advancing heroically and magnificently. All tests have proven that our country is truly a great country, our people are truly a great people, our army is truly a great army, and our Party is truly a great Party. At the same time, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, are raging fiercely. The Party Central Committee's wise judgments have long been proven by the ironclad facts of our country's reality.

However, the anti-Party black gang led by Zhou Yang was blinded by greed and made a wrong assessment of the situation. To achieve their unspoken goals, they described our vibrant socialist reality as a mess of black and ugly at the Dalian Conference. They followed the example of the Khrushchev revisionists, exposing their chests and acting without restraint, united in their efforts to depict our country's vibrant socialist reality as a mess of black and ugly.

They ranted about how the "hard times" of the peasants began in "1953," and how the "first transition period general line" had problems back then. They said that after the unified purchase, "the couplets the peasants stick on their doors get narrower and narrower, and later three doors share one couplet," and they even twisted black and white to say that the peasants' "days are getting harder and harder." They felt that this cursing was not enough and gnashed their teeth to slander that the peasants had "no hope for the future" and felt "disillusioned" with the Party and socialism! Whose words are these? This is completely the language of landlords and rich peasants, the language of counter-revolutionaries!

Not only that, they also directed their attacks at the Communist Party, the socialist system, and the three red banners. They said that the main contradiction in our socialist society is the "contradiction between the state, the collective, and the individual" (according to their explanation, this is the contradiction between the interests of the Party and the masses). They tried to incite the broad masses of the people against the Party. Therefore, they maliciously cursed the Communist Party and fiercely attacked the Party's three red banners. They said that the Party's implementation of the general line was a "nouveau riche mentality"; that the Great Leap Forward was a "twelve-level typhoon" and "taking stimulants"; that the People's Communes were "rushing ahead" and that the "superiority of the collective" was hardly visible. They arrogantly shouted: "Wherever there is contract responsibility to the household, wherever there is individual farming, it can be done!" They openly advocated the restoration of individual farming and the restoration of capitalism.

Look, how arrogant and vicious this counter-revolutionary black gang is, and how complacent they are!

It was on this counter-revolutionary political foundation that they finally gave literature the anti-Party, anti-socialist "political task" of "deepening realism," writing about "intermediate characters," writing about anti-Party "wind-resistant heroes," and vigorously exposing the "darkness" of socialist society. Therefore, they fiercely attacked and mocked revolutionary realism and the combination of revolutionary romanticism, and maliciously cursed our revolutionary heroes. They said: "The positive characters we create are very simple, only highlighting heroic and model deeds, day and night, as if they have a nervous disorder.... as if blowing up a pig, it swells up, and they shave off the flaws, wash it clean, making the pig fat and shiny, but it's not a living pig!" It can be seen how much class hatred these people have for our revolutionary heroes! How much they fear our revolutionary heroes! To achieve the above counter-revolutionary political purposes, they fiercely shouted: "To die for our class!" That is, to die for the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and rightists!

The conference lasted for half a month. This anti-Party black gang used the most vicious words in the world, unrestrainedly venting their hatred for the Party and socialism.

The Commander Appears: Zhou Yang is the Chief Culprit of the Dalian Conference

Why did this anti-Party black gang dare to be so arrogant? This is because they had Zhou Yang, the head of the black gang, to support and encourage them. This black gang leader was afraid that his disciples were not anti-Party enough, so he personally rushed to the venue during the conference and gave a long "report." This comprehensive anti-Party "report" was of extremely high "quality." The viciousness of his words, the arrogance of his demeanor, the ingenuity of his lies, and the intensity of his poison made the seated "experts" in poisoning look inferior.

In this "report," Zhou Yang systematically, blatantly, and from multiple angles peddled his anti-Party political and literary programs.

Just like the right-opportunist elements, he fiercely attacked the three red banners, slandering the Great Leap Forward as "subjective idealism" and the People's Communes as being established "too early." After howling for a while, he then revealed his "three selfs and one contract" black goods, advocating individual farming, vigorously promoting "private plots," and opening "free markets" to thoroughly restore capitalism. This black gang even used the Soviet revisionist line to defend "three selfs and one contract": "The Soviet Union now has more private plots than we do, I think it's not bad, having some private plots and free markets, I don't think it's necessarily bad, don't be so afraid." He also said that "as long as there is contract responsibility to the household, production will rise." He threatened fiercely: "Don't forcefully correct individual farming, if you forcefully correct it, production will decline," but should adopt the Khrushchev revisionist line. He said: "Now it seems that we should adopt the method of competition." Zhou Yang's "competition" is to promote Soviet revisionist bourgeois liberalization. If we follow Zhou Yang's line, then our country will change color, and the landlord-bourgeoisie will once again ride on the heads of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is absolutely unacceptable, and Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary wishful thinking will never be realized.

Even more intolerable is that Zhou Yang, in his report, repeatedly attacked our great leader Chairman Mao. He used the excuse that literary works should reflect the "experience" of the "whole Party" and the "whole Party cadres," maliciously obstructing writers from singing the praises of Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. He said: "Without the Party, spontaneous struggle can also be written." That is, neither sing the praises of Chairman Mao nor the Communist Party. Look how arrogant Zhou Yang is!

Zhou Yang fiercely attacked our vigorous promotion of Mao Zedong Thought and opposed our criticism of modern revisionism. He sneered: "Theory alone is not enough, you also need to produce goods." This tone is exactly the same as Khrushchev's tone when he cursed us!

Zhou Yang vigorously opposed the proletarian orientation of literature. He bluntly said: "Before the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, writing about intellectuals with the sympathy of intellectuals was wrong. Writing about technicians, intellectuals from the perspective of the working class is acceptable. The working class should not be sectarian, should not only write about workers and peasants, the proletarian literature only writes about workers and peasants, this view is a wrong view." Zhou Yang's words were directly aimed at Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." His so-called "only write" and so on, is a slander and excuse for the proletariat, aiming to firmly oppose the literary line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. What he vigorously advocated was writing about the "Sino-Japanese War," the "palace," the "emperor," bourgeois "scientists," "professors," "technicians," "primary and secondary school teachers"..., saying that "these themes can all be written."

Zhou Yang desperately opposed literature serving proletarian politics. He said: "Writers are not necessarily required to write about current events," "don't write about a policy proposed today, and another policy proposed tomorrow," that is, literature should not be subordinate to the revolutionary tasks specified by the Party in a certain period, should not serve proletarian politics. He also shamelessly said that this is the writer's "party spirit." It is clear that the party spirit he talked about is the reactionary party spirit of his bourgeois diehards, the party spirit of his counter-revolutionary dead followers.

At this meeting, Zhou Yang also specially advocated "exposure" literature and "anger" literature. He opposed writers recognizing and reflecting life according to the Party's policies and guidelines, saying that writers "should write based on what they have seen and felt, they may have seen wrongly or felt wrongly, but they should still write like this." That is, to insist on their reactionary views to the end. Therefore, he called on writers to write "angry works." He said that the current "works lack anger, we need to create works with anger. I think the past works were all indignant, now let's express some anger, maybe there will be good works." The "anger" Zhou Yang talked about here is the deep hatred of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries for the Party and socialism. He believed that only by venting such "anger" could good works be written. Therefore, he advocated vigorously exposing the "dark side" of our socialist society, saying that "if written well, it would be more vivid than 'Virgin Land.'" All this shows that Zhou Yang's advocacy of writing "angry" literature is to vent anger at the Party and socialism, to overthrow proletarian dictatorship, and to turn literature into a tool for bourgeois restoration.

It is very clear that the Dalian Conference was such a black meeting against the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought led by Zhou Yang. It was not a "pure literary" meeting, nor was it just a problem of Shao Qianlin. This black gang ridiculed and cursed the Party and socialism, wishing to curse the Communist Party down and destroy socialism, so that they, these demons and monsters, could seize power from the proletariat.

However, "an ant trying to shake a big tree is laughable and self-delusional." Zhou Yang and his gang made a wrong assessment of the situation. These anti-Party, anti-socialist elements are experts in making mistakes. When they cursed the most vigorously, when they were most rampant in restoring capitalism, it was also when their doomsday was approaching.

Covering Up the Truth: The First Fake Criticism Concealed the Facts

In September 1962, just one month after the Dalian Conference ended, Chairman Mao, at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, issued the great call to "never forget class struggle." The entire Party and the people immediately responded to the call, sharpened their eyes, and launched a sharp struggle against the class enemies. Zhou Yang and his gang were in a panic, fearing that their anti-Party faces would be exposed, and quickly tucked in their tails, concealing their anti-Party actions, and covering up the truth of the Dalian anti-Party black meeting. They sealed the conference records and did not let the Party Central Committee and the revolutionary masses know. They adopted the tactic of deceiving the superiors and cheating the inferiors, sealing the secrets of this black meeting tightly. Truly, "the secrets of heaven must not be revealed."

In December 1963 and June 1964, Chairman Mao issued extremely important instructions on the cultural revolution issue. In June 1964, Chairman Mao sharply pointed out at the rectification of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and its affiliated associations: These associations and the publications they control (it is said that there are a few good ones), in the past fifteen years, basically (not everyone) have not implemented the Party's policies, acted like officials, and have not approached the workers, peasants, and soldiers, nor reflected the socialist revolution and construction. In recent years, they have even fallen to the brink of revisionism. If they are not seriously reformed, they will inevitably become organizations like the Hungarian Petofi Club on some day in the future.

Chairman Mao's instructions were like a spring thunder, inspiring the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary literary and art workers, and at the same time, shocking the big and small demons and monsters. The situation for Zhou Yang and his gang was becoming worse and worse. But Zhou Yang was very cunning, he tried every means to resist Chairman Mao's instructions, sabotage the cultural revolution, and try to get away with it. In August 1964, when he heard that local Party organizations wanted to copy back some speeches from the Dalian Conference, he was very angry and quickly called someone to stop the matter. (Until February 1965, five months had passed, and Lin Mofan instructed Yuan Shui to write a letter criticizing the matter, which shows how big the ghosts in the hearts of this black gang are!) Afterwards, Zhou Yang made a fake self-criticism. He hypocritically said that he had made a bureaucratic mistake and had not tightened control over the lower levels. He tried to cover up his anti-Party crimes with a piece of fake self-criticism.

Zhou Yang had ulterior motives, and after doing this, he was still not sure. To save his own life, he did not care about his accomplices, and he grabbed Shao Qianlin as a scapegoat. Thus, under the careful planning of Zhou Yang and others, a farce of deceiving the Party Central Committee, cheating the masses, protecting the bad elements, and protecting themselves—the criticism of "Writing Intermediate Characters"—began.

"The Materials on 'Writing Intermediate Characters'" were manufactured after Zhou Yang and his backers set the scope and specifications. They only allowed discussion of literary issues and did not allow any political issues to be raised. All political speeches against the Party and socialism were kept secret. They only allowed the name of Shao Qianlin to be mentioned and did not allow the names of "other people" to be mentioned; they only allowed the materials of Shao Qianlin to be published and did not allow the materials of "other people" to be published, even if they were reactionary speeches in the field of literature, they were not allowed to be published. It is clear that the so-called "other people" first refers to Zhou Yang, the head of the black gang. They presented such "materials" to deceive the Party and the masses, tying the hands of the critics, and no one could step out of the circle of academic discussion, ultimately achieving the shameful goal of protecting Zhou Yang, the total head of the anti-Party in the literary world.

"The 'Writing Intermediate Characters' is a Bourgeois Literary Proposal" was personally revised and finalized by Zhou Yang and his backers. The article, like the "materials," only criticized Shao Qianlin's "literary proposal" and deliberately avoided political issues. This is a "masterpiece" that is very skillfully paired with the "materials." The purpose is clear, to set the tone with the name of the editorial department, so that all critical articles sing in this tune. In the article, the bourgeois representatives of the Literary Gazette, following the master's instructions, displayed their talent for deception; Zhou Yang was even more brilliant, and all the words in the article that could expose his tracks were removed, even a sentence that was slightly close to political issues was not allowed.

It is now clear that the 1964 criticism of the "Writing Intermediate Characters" theory was a despicable deception created by Zhou Yang and his gang! This criticism sacrificed a black gang henchman, Shao Qianlin, and preserved the black gang leader, Zhou Yang. And the criticism of Shao Qianlin himself was also fake.

Attacking to Defend: Attempting to Escape in the Second Fake Criticism

Two years later, in April 1966, when the great proletarian cultural revolution was flourishing in our country, the Literary Gazette suddenly clamored to restart the "criticism" of Shao Qianlin's "Writing Intermediate Characters" theory. What was this about?

It turned out to be another new deception and conspiracy!

The incident had a cause. On November 10, 1965, the Wenhui Daily published Comrade Yao Wenyuan's "On the New Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,'" opening the curtain on the struggle to smash the "Three Family Village" black shop. When the Liberation Army Daily reprinted it, it added a clear editorial note, pointing out that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a big poisonous weed. But the literary black gang led by Zhou Yang did not move for a long time, not allowing the Literary Gazette and other publications to organize articles criticizing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," and carefully resisting the criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" initiated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In February 1966, they saw that the struggle to criticize "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was deepening day by day, and it was no longer possible to "not interfere." Thus, Zhou Yang and his gang racked their brains and came up with new tricks, adopting the tactic of attacking to defend, including restarting the Literary Gazette's criticism of the "Writing Intermediate Characters" theory, dragging out this "dead tiger" Shao Qianlin to beat him up again. They tried to use this method to shift the target, disrupt the lines of criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," and once again cover up their anti-Party, anti-socialist crimes, cover up their crimes of organizing the "Hai Rui play" to attack the Party, and at the same time, let the bosses, clerks, and big bosses of the "Three Family Village" escape in the chaos.

Thus, in February 1966, Zhou Yang, Lin Mofan, and a group of black gang members again used the Literary Gazette to plan the second fake criticism of "Writing Intermediate Characters."

On February 8, Lin Mofan hurriedly instructed: "The Literary Gazette should formulate 'a battle plan on the literary front,' and hinted: 'Do not just follow the newspapers.' That is, do not follow along to criticize 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,' but should 're-raise the issue of 'Writing Intermediate Characters.' This conspiracy, after they conspired, was first realized in the Literary Gazette's 1966 thought criticism plan. This plan, which was only formulated in February this year, openly declared that it would "propose the main direction of attack on the literary front." It said that the "main direction of attack this year is: taking the 'Writing Intermediate Characters' theory and the 'Deepening Realism' theory as the main targets," and the "essence of 'Writing Intermediate Characters,'" it is said, is the "little people" in the 18th and 19th-century European literature; the so-called "deepening realism" is said to be the "critical realism" of the 18th and 19th centuries. The plan clearly stipulated that this criticism must be "guided to the direction of criticizing critical realism," and must "comprehensively deploy and persistently" carry it out. They blatantly said that they would put the big poisonous weed "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" in the "main direction of attack outside a few main topics," and proposed the next step: "After the criticism of 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,' 'Xie Yaohuan,' and others is further deepened, we will focus on the issue of 'using the past to serve the present' in historical dramas to 'participate in the struggle.'"

It is clear that this counter-revolutionary plan attempted to lead all criticism to the path of "pure academia," openly resisting the proletarian cultural revolution, and trying to save the king and mix in the water to protect Zhou Yang and his gang from getting away with it.

With the "policy" set, Lin Mofan and his gang "comprehensively deployed" and "persistently" carried it out. They came up with a large number of topics for criticizing "little people" and "realism," and produced "re-attack" articles.

This second act of the fake criticism farce, under the title "Which Class's Political Requirements Does the 'Writing Intermediate Characters' Theory Reflect?" debuted in the April issue of the Literary Gazette. They also mentioned the Dalian Conference, but neither published the anti-Party, anti-socialist political materials of this black conference nor allowed the authors of the articles to quote these materials in the articles. They repeatedly deleted the political speeches quoted in the articles and repeatedly modified and smoothed out the politically sharp parts of the articles. The original text originally had such a passage: "A new historical feature of this anti-socialist trend: it often finds spokesmen within the Party, and many of them are the ruling faction within the Party. Their views and proposals often appear in the guise of implementing the Party's policy guidelines, and are spread and promoted through certain organizational lines. Therefore, it is even more confusing and harmful, which is a manifestation of the deepening of class struggle." This passage hit the sore spot of this group of bourgeois black gang, and they united to oppose this passage, and finally, they raised the axe and chopped off this passage. After four revisions, the political speeches were almost deleted, and the political criticism was no longer sharp, and they were satisfied and published it in the Literary Gazette.

Even more vile was that before this article, they added a deceptive "editor's note." In this "editor's note," the whole page was full of "literary proposals," such as Shao Qianlin "wants literary creation" and so on, and his "literary proposals" and so on, and if Shao Qianlin's proposals were followed, our socialist literature would be like this and that, and so on, but not a word was mentioned about Shao Qianlin and "other people" politically opposing the Party and socialism. It was really a labor of love, using all their wit!

These conspirators, schemers, are so treacherous, so cunning, so vicious! They tried to use the above conspiracies and tricks to stage another "grand" "pure academic criticism" like in 1964, covering up the black curtain of the Dalian Conference and diverting people's attention from the criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." They had wild ideas, not only to save the head of the literary black gang, Zhou Yang, but also to rescue the "generals," "commanders," "chariots," and "horses" of the "Three Family Village" from the encirclement of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to perform a great feat, so that they could be promoted in the future.

Zhou Yang and his gang's wishful thinking this time was completely wrong, and their beautiful dream was completely shattered! Just as they were plotting new deceptions and conspiracies, their black hands were caught by the revolutionary masses, their masks were torn off, their black curtains were exposed, and they were surrounded by the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary literary and art workers, and they could no longer escape or slip away, their doomsday had come.

Chairman Mao teaches us that to overthrow a regime, one must first seize the superstructure, first seize the ideology, and make good preparations for public opinion. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this.

Zhou Yang, this representative of the bourgeoisie who has infiltrated the Party, the number one enemy of proletarian literature, wearing the title of "Marxist literary figure," has long been in charge of the leadership of literary work in our country, always seizing the superstructure, seizing ideology, doing evil, deceiving, and doing all kinds of bad things to prepare conditions for the restoration of capitalism. The Dalian Conference and the fake criticism of "Writing Intermediate Characters" are among them. Zhou Yang used his power to recruit and surrender, gathering a large number of demons and monsters, forming their counter-revolutionary class army. They have long controlled literary organizations and literary publications, sunning and opposing the Party's literary policies, and promoting a whole set of bourgeois, revisionist literary lines. The Zhou Yang black gang step by step wants to turn the literary organizations they control into China's "Petofi Club"; turn the literary publications they control into tools for the restoration of capitalism. Zhou Yang's actions and words have completely exposed his revisionist, counter-revolutionary face.

Today, the lid of the black line's rule in the literary world has been lifted, and Zhou Yang, the "ancestor" of the black line, has been exposed. This is a heartwarming thing. "It is appropriate to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage," we must continue to attack and expose the various crimes of the Zhou Yang black gang. We are firmly convinced that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will definitely overthrow the literary black line and the literary black gang led by Zhou Yang! We will definitely carry the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

    《文艺报》的两次假批判
    李基凯　吴松亭　杨匡满　侯聚元
    建国十几年来，以周扬为首的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，把持着不少文艺机关、文艺团体、文艺刊物，积极为实现资本主义复辟制造舆论。《文艺报》就是他们手中的一个得力工具，就是他们散布资产阶级、修正主义文艺谬论的一个制造公司和经销公司，就是他们向党向社会主义进攻的一个前哨阵地。周扬通过他在《文艺报》的亲信和门徒，把《文艺报》变成了一个地主资产阶级的“杂家”阵地。多年以来，《文艺报》摇着黑旗，紧密配合国内外阶级敌人的进攻，纠集了大量牛鬼蛇神，积极鼓动他们出笼，狂热地推行了一整套资产阶级、现代修正主义的文艺路线，犯下了严重的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行。
    无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈地开展以后，周扬黑帮控制的《文艺报》，改变战术，假批判、真包庇，假革命、真抵制，且战且退，负隅顽抗，反对党中央和毛主席发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命。
    现在让我们来戳穿一个大阴谋、大骗局！
    大连会议——一个有组织、有计划的反革命黑会
    人们都还记忆犹新，《文艺报》在一九六四年八、九月合刊上，抛出了《关于“写中间人物”的材料》和编辑部的文章《“写中间人物”是资产阶级的文学主张》。长篇材料，大块文章，一搭一档，喧嚣一时。
    这是一次什么样的批判呢？
    这是一次虚张声势的假批判。
    这是一次瞒天过海的大骗局。
    “写中间人物”，是一九六二年八月邵荃麟在大连创作座谈会上系统地提出来的。但是，这个座谈会远不只是一个邵荃麟和一个文学主张的问题，而是一个彻头彻尾的反党反社会主义的黑会，是一个有组织有计划的“裴多菲俱乐部”式的集会。
    大连会议挂的是讨论“创作”的招牌，干的是反党反社会主义的勾当。周扬是大连会议的魁首，邵荃麟等人则是这次会议的积极组织者。
    大连会议是在党的八届十中全会召开前夕开场的。当时我们国内的形势，正如党中央指出的：“无论在农村或者城市，我们的经济情况正在一天一天地好起来”，“我们的前途是光明的”。广大的人民群众和干部在党的领导下，高举三面红旗，经受了重重考验，克服了种种困难，正在英勇豪迈地胜利前进。一切考验都证明，我们的国家不愧为伟大的国家，我们的人民不愧为伟大的人民，我们的军队不愧为伟大的军队，我们的党不愧为伟大的党。同时，社会上无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，正在十分激烈地进行。党中央的这些英明的论断，早已为我国现实生活中铁一般的事实所证明。
    可是，以周扬为首的这群反党黑帮，却利令智昏，错误地估计了形势。为了达到他们不可告人的目的，在大连会议上，他们象赫鲁晓夫修正主义者一样，袒胸露腹，肆无忌惮、齐心合力地把我国朝气勃勃的社会主义现实，描绘得一团漆黑、乌七八糟。
    他们胡说什么农民的“苦日子”是从“一九五三年开始的”，“第一次过渡时期总路线，那时问题已经出来了”。“统购以后，（农民贴）对子愈贴愈窄，以后三个门贴一副对子”，而且颠倒黑白地说：农民的“日子愈过愈困难”。他们感到这样咒骂还不解恨，还咬牙切齿地污蔑说：农民对未来也“没有个盼头”，对党对社会主义“确实有破灭之感！”这是什么人的话？这完全是地主富农的语言，是反革命的语言！
    不仅如此，他们还把矛头直接指向共产党、社会主义制度和三面红旗。他们说：我国社会主义社会的主要矛盾是“国家、集体、个人三者之间的”矛盾（按照他们的解释，也就是党的利益和人民群众的利益之间的矛盾），企图挑拨广大人民群众和党之间的关系。因此，他们大肆咒骂共产党，疯狂地攻击党的三面红旗。胡说党贯彻总路线“是暴发户心理”；胡说大跃进“是刮十二级台风”、“是吃了兴奋剂”；胡说人民公社是“冒进了”、“集体的优越性就好象看不大见了”。他们狂妄地叫嚣：“哪些包产到户、哪些单干，都可以！”公开主张恢复单干，复辟资本主义。
    请看，这群反革命黑帮是多么嚣张，多么狠毒，又是多么得意忘形！
    就是在这样的反革命的政治基础上，他们最后给文艺规定了反党反社会主义的“政治任务”，这就是通过“现实主义深化”，大写“中间人物”，大写反党的“顶风英雄”，大力揭露社会主义社会的“黑暗”。因此，他们疯狂地攻击和嘲笑革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的创作原则，恶毒地咒骂我们的革命英雄人物。他们说：我们所创造的“正面人物写得非常简单，只扣英雄模范事迹，日夜不分，好象得了神经病，……好象吹猪似的，肿大起来，而且刮毛，把缺点都刮掉，洗得很漂亮，猪又胖又光，但不是活猪！”可以看出，这些家伙对我们的革命英雄人物怀着多么刻骨的阶级仇恨！他们对我们的革命英雄人物又害怕到何等程度！为了达到上述的反革命政治目的，他们气势汹汹地叫嚣：要“冒死为（自己）这个阶级说话！”也就是要冒死为地富反坏右说话！
    会议整整开了半个月。这一伙反党黑帮用尽了人间最狠毒的词句，肆无忌惮地发泄他们对党对社会主义的刻骨仇恨。
    主帅登场——周扬是大连会议的罪魁祸首
    这群反党黑帮为什么胆敢如此猖狂呢？这就是因为有周扬这个黑帮头子给他们撑腰，给他们打气。这个黑帮头子生怕他的门徒反党反得还不够，在会议进行中间，还亲自赶到会场，向到会的人作了一个长篇“报告”。这个集大成的反党“报告”，“质量”极高。其言词之险恶，容色之张狂，造谣之奇妙，毒性之浓烈，使在座的放毒“专家”们，个个相形见绌。
    在这个“报告”中，周扬系统地、露骨地、多方面地兜售了他的反党的政治纲领和文艺纲领。
    跟右倾机会主义分子一模一样，他疯狂地攻击三面红旗，污蔑大跃进是“主观唯心主义”，人民公社“办早了”。狺狺嚎叫了一阵以后，接着他就亮出了“三自一包”的黑货，主张实行单干，大搞“自留地”，大开“自由市场”，彻底复辟资本主义。这个黑帮竟然抬出苏联修正主义的那一套来为“三自一包”辩护：“苏联现在自留地比我们还多，我看没什么，有点自留地、自由市场，我看不一定很坏，不要那么害怕。”而且胡说什么“只要包产到户，生产就上升。”他气势汹汹地威胁说：对单干“不要硬去纠，采取硬去纠，一纠生产下降”，而应当采取赫鲁晓夫修正主义那一套。他说：“现在看来是要采取竞赛的方式。”周扬说的“竞赛”，就是搞苏联修正主义那一套资产阶级自由化。如果依了周扬这一套，那么，我们的国家就要改变颜色，地主资产阶级老爷们就会重新骑到工农兵群众的头上。这是我们绝对不能允许的，周扬的这一套反革命的如意算盘是永远不能实现的。
    更不能令人容忍的是，周扬在报告中，竟多次地攻击我们的伟大领袖毛主席。他借口文学作品要表现“全党”的“经验”、“全党干部”，用心险恶地阻止作家去歌颂毛主席、歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想。他说：“没有党，自发（斗争）也可以写。”就是说，既不要歌颂毛主席，也不要歌颂共产党。看，周扬猖狂到何等地步！
    周扬疯狂地攻击我们大力宣传毛泽东思想，反对我们批判现代修正主义。他讽刺说：“单是理论不行，也还要拿出货色”。这个腔调和赫鲁晓夫咒骂我们时的腔调完全一样！
    周扬竭力反对文艺的工农兵方向。他直截了当地说：“延安文艺座谈会以前，以知识分子的同情写知识分子是错误的。用工人阶级的观点写技术人员、知识分子是可以的。工人阶级不应该宗派，不应只写工农，无产阶级文学只写工农，这种观点是错误的观点。”周扬这段话的矛头是直接指向毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的。他所谓“只写”云云，是对无产阶级的污蔑和借口，目的是坚决反对文艺为工农兵服务的路线。而他竭力提倡的则是写“甲午战争”、写“皇宫”、写“皇帝”、写资产阶级“科学家”、“教授”、“技术员”、“中小学教员”……，说什么“这些题材都可以写”。
    周扬拚命反对文艺为无产阶级政治服务。他说：作家“不是一定要写当前的事”，“不要今天提出个政策，去写，明天提出个政策，又去写”，这就是说文艺不要从属于党在一定时期所规定的革命任务，不要为无产阶级政治服务。他还无耻地说，这就是作家的“党性”。很清楚，他所说的党性，就是他的反动的资产阶级顽固派的党性，是他的反革命死党的党性。
    在这次会上，周扬还特别提倡“暴露”文学、“愤怒”文学。他反对作家按照党的方针政策去认识生活、反映生活，说什么作家“要根据他自己所感受到的、所见到的写，也可能见错了、感错了，但也还要这样。”这就是说，要至死不变地坚持自己的反动观点。因此，他号召作家大写“愤怒的作品”。他说，现在的“作品没有愤怒，要搞个有愤怒的作品。我看过去的作品都是有愤慨的，现在发一点愤怒，也许会有好作品。”周扬这里所说的“愤怒”，就是地主、富农、反革命分子对党对社会主义的刻骨仇恨。他认为只有发泄出这样的“愤怒”，才会写出“好作品”。所以他主张大力揭露我国社会主义社会的“阴暗面”，说什么“写得好，比《被开垦的处女地》还生动。”这一切都说明，周扬提倡大写“愤怒”文学，就是要向党向社会主义发愤怒，就是要颠覆无产阶级专政，就是要把文艺变成资产阶级复辟的工具。
    事情非常清楚，大连会议，就是这样一个以周扬为首的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑会。决不是什么“纯文学”的会议，也决不只是一个邵荃麟的问题。这一伙黑帮，对党对社会主义进行了冷嘲热讽，连笑带骂，巴不得一下子把共产党骂倒，把社会主义搞垮，好让他们这些牛鬼蛇神来专我们无产阶级的政。
    可是，“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”，周扬一伙对形势作了错误的估计。这些反党反社会主义分子，都是犯错误的专家。他们骂得最起劲的时候，他们复辟资本主义最猖獗的时候，也正是他们末日到来的时候。
    瞒天过海——第一次假批判掩盖了事实真相
    一九六二年九月，也就是大连会议收场后的一个月，毛主席在党的八届十中全会上，发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召。全党全民立即响应号召，擦亮眼睛，对阶级敌人展开尖锐的斗争。周扬及其一伙，慌了手脚，怕暴露了反党面目，连忙夹起尾巴，收敛起反党行迹，把大连反党黑会的真相遮掩起来，又将会议记录全部封锁起来，不让党中央和革命群众知道。他们采取了瞒上欺下的手法，把这个黑会的内幕封闭得严严的。真可谓“天机不可泄漏”。
    一九六三年十二月和一九六四年六月，毛主席连续对文化革命问题作了极为重要的指示。一九六四年六月，毛主席在全国文联和所属各协会整风时尖锐指出：这些协会和他们所掌握的刊物的大多数（据说有少数几个好的），十五年来，基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。
    毛主席的指示，有如一声春雷，鼓舞了广大的工农兵、革命干部和革命文艺工作者，同时也震惊了大大小小的牛鬼蛇神。形势对周扬一伙愈来愈不妙了。但周扬狡猾得很，他想方设法地抗拒毛主席的指示，破坏文化大革命，妄图蒙混过关。一九六四年八月，当他听说地方上的党组织要把大连会议上某些人的发言抄录回去时，非常恼火，急急忙忙叫人打电话制止此事。（直到一九六五年二月，事情已经过去五个月了，林默涵又指示袁水拍写信指责这件事，可见这群黑帮心里的鬼有多大！）之后，周扬做了一个假检讨。他假惺惺地说什么：“我犯了官僚主义的错误，对下面没有抓紧。”妄图用一纸假检讨掩盖住他的反党罪行。
    周扬心怀鬼胎，他做了这一套之后还怕不保险。为了救自己的命，也顾不得同伙了，他就抓了一个邵荃麟当作替死鬼。于是，在周扬等人的精心策划下，一出蒙蔽党中央、欺骗群众、包庇坏人、保护自己的丑剧——关于“写中间人物”的批判就这样开场了。
    《关于“写中间人物”的材料》，是由周扬及其后台老板规定范围、制订规格后炮制出来的。他们只准提文学问题，不准涉及一点政治问题，凡是属于反党反社会主义的政治言论，统统秘而不宣。他们只准提邵荃麟的名字，不准提“其他人的名字”；只准公布邵荃麟的材料，不准公布“其他人”的材料，即使是属于文学方面的反动言论，也不准公布。很明显，这里所谓“其他人”，首先就是周扬这个黑帮头子。他们拿出这样的“材料”，就是要欺骗党、欺骗群众，束缚批判者的手脚，谁也别想走出学术讨论的圈子，最后达到保护周扬这个文艺界反党总头目的可耻目的。
    《“写中间人物”是资产阶级的文学主张》是周扬及其后台老板亲笔修改定稿的。文章和“材料”一样，也是只批判邵荃麟的一个“文学主张”，竭力回避政治问题。这是和“材料”搭配得相当巧妙的“杰作”。目的很明显，用编辑部的名义发表，就是要定下调子，让所有的批判文章都按照这个调子来唱。在文章中，《文艺报》的资产阶级代表人物遵照主子意旨，发挥了弄虚作假的“天才”；周扬更胜一筹，文章中凡是有可能露马脚的词句，他都给一一剔去，哪怕是稍稍接近政治问题的一句话也不放过。
    现在十分清楚，一九六四年对“写中间人物”论的批判，是周扬们卑鄙地制造出来的一个大骗局！这次批判，丢掉了一个黑帮爪牙邵荃麟，保存了一个黑帮头子周扬。而对邵荃麟本身的批判，也是假的。
    以攻为守——企图在第二次假批判中溜之大吉
    事隔两年，到一九六六年四月，在我国无产阶级文化大革命蓬勃兴起之时，《文艺报》又突然吵吵嚷嚷地重新发起了对邵荃麟“写中间人物”的“批判”。这又是怎么一回事呢？
    原来，这又是一个新的大骗局，大阴谋！
    事起有因。一九六五年十一月十日，《文汇报》发表了姚文元同志的《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》，揭开了捣毁“三家村”黑店斗争的序幕。《解放军报》转载时，加了旗帜鲜明的编者按，指出《海瑞罢官》是一株大毒草。但以周扬为首的文艺黑帮迟迟按兵不动，不让《文艺报》及其他刊物组织批判《海瑞罢官》的文章，处心积虑地抵制由党中央、毛主席发起的对《海瑞罢官》的批判。一九六六年二月，他们看到批判《海瑞罢官》的斗争一天天深入，再“不管”已经不行了，就要自身难保了。于是，周扬及其一伙又挖空心思，想出了新的花招，采取以攻为守的战术，其中包括要《文艺报》重新发起对“写中间人物”论的批判，把邵荃麟这个“死老虎”拖出来重新打一顿。他们企图用这种手段来转移目标，扰乱批判《海瑞罢官》的阵线，再次掩盖自己的反党反社会主义罪行，掩盖自己组织
  “海瑞戏”向党进攻的罪行，同时也好让“三家村”的掌柜、伙计和大老板在混战中溜之大吉。
    于是，一九六六年二月，周扬、林默涵等一群黑帮又通过《文艺报》，第二次着手策划“写中间人物”假批判。
    二月八日，林默涵急急忙忙指示说：《文艺报》要订出“一个文学战线上的作战计划”，并暗示说：“不能光跟报纸跑”。这就是说，不要跟着一起去批判《海瑞罢官》，而应该“重新提出‘写中间人物’问题”。这个阴谋经过他们密谋之后，首先在《文艺报》一九六六年思想批判计划中实现了。这个直到今年二月份才制订出来的计划，公开宣称“要提出在文学战线上的主攻方向”。说什么今年的“主攻方向是：以‘写中间人物’论和‘现实主义深化’论为主要对象”，而“‘写中间人物’的实质”，据说就是十八、十九世纪欧洲文学中的“小人物”；所谓“现实主义深化”，据说就是十八、十九世纪的“批判现实主义”。计划中明确规定，一定要把这次批判“引导到对于批判现实主义的批判”的方向上去，且要抱住这个“主攻方向”“通盘部署、坚持不懈”地干下去。他们明目张胆地说，要把大毒草《海瑞罢官》放在批判的“主攻方向以外的几个主要题目”上去考虑，并且提出下一个步骤：“对《海瑞罢官》、《谢瑶环》等的批判再深入展开后，想着重在”“历史剧的古为今用”的问题上“参加斗争”。
    很明显，这个反革命计划，企图把所有的批判都引到“纯学术”的道路上去，以此公开反抗无产阶级文化大革命，妄想丢车保帅、混水摸鱼，保护周扬一伙蒙混过关。
    “方针”既定，林默涵一伙就“通盘部署”、“坚持不懈”地干起来了。他们搞了一大堆批判“小人物”和“现实主义”的选题，搞出了“重新发难”的文章。
    这第二出假批判的丑剧，在《文艺报》四月号上，以《“写中间人物”论反映了哪个阶级的政治要求》为题，粉墨登场了。他们也提到大连会议，可是既不公布这个黑会的反党反社会主义的政治材料，又不准文章的作者在文章中引用这些材料。他们一再的删削文章中引用的政治言论，一再的把文章中政治批判尖锐的地方修改、磨平。原文中本来有这样一段话：“这股反社会主义思潮的一个新的历史特点：是它多半都在党内找到了代言人，而且不少是党内的当权派。他们的观点和主张，往往是以贯彻党的方针指示的面貌出现，通过一定的组织路线进行传播和推广的。因此它就更加迷惑人，危害就更大，这是阶级斗争深入的一种表现。”这段话刺到了这群资产阶级黑帮的痛处，他们就联合起来反对这段话，最后就抡起板斧把这段话砍掉了。文章经过四次修改，政治言论删削得差不多了，政治批判也不尖锐了，他们才心满意足地在《文艺报》上发表出来。
    尤其恶毒的是，在这篇文章前面还加了一个欺骗性的“编者按”。这个“编者按”中满纸都是“文学主张”，什么邵荃麟“却要文学创作”如何如何，什么“他的文学主张”如何如何，什么“如果依了邵荃麟同志的主张，我国的社会主义文学”又会如何如何，等等，不一而足，可就是只字不提邵荃麟和“其他人”政治上如何反党反社会主义。真是煞费了苦心，用尽了心思！
    陷入重围——周扬黑帮反革命阴谋大暴露
    这些阴谋家、野心家就是这样阴险，这样狡诈，这样毒辣！他们企图通过以上这些阴谋诡计，再搞一次如同一九六四年那样“声势浩大”的“纯学术批判”，既掩盖了大连会议的黑幕，又把人们的注意力从《海瑞罢官》的批判中吸引过来。他们异想天开，不仅要保住文艺黑帮总头目周扬，还要把“三家村”的
  “将”“帅”“车”“马”们，从工农兵群众的重重包围中解救出来，立一奇功，以便将来“加官晋爵”。
    周扬一伙这次的如意算盘完全打错了，美梦完全破灭了！正当他们策划新的骗局、新的阴谋时，他们的黑手被革命群众抓住了，他们的假面具被戳穿了，他们的黑幕被揭开了，他们陷入了广大工农兵、革命干部和革命文艺工作者的重重围剿之中，再也溜不走、滑不掉，他们的末日到了。
    毛主席教导我们，要推翻一个政权，必须先抓上层建筑，先抓意识形态，作好舆论准备，革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。
    周扬这个钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物、无产阶级文艺的头号敌人，挂着“马克思主义文艺家”的头衔，长期窃踞着我国文艺工作的领导地位，一直在抓上层建筑，抓意识形态，为非作歹，弄虚作假，干尽坏事，来为复辟资本主义准备条件。大连会议和“写中间人物”假批判，就是其中之一。周扬利用职权，招降纳叛，纠集了大量的牛鬼蛇神，组成他们反革命的阶级队伍。他们长期控制着文艺机关和文艺刊物，对毛泽东文艺思想和党的文艺政策阳奉阴违，篡改抵制，推行一整套资产阶级、修正主义的文艺路线。周扬黑帮一步步地要把他们所控制的文艺机关，变成中国的“裴多菲俱乐部”；把他们所控制的文艺刊物，变成复辟资本主义的工具。周扬的所作所为，所言所行，彻底暴露了他的修正主义的反革命面目。
    今天，文艺界黑线统治的盖子已经揭开了，周扬这个黑线“祖师爷”已经揪出来了，这是一件大快人心的事。“宜将剩勇追穷寇”，我们一定要乘胜追击，继续揭发周扬黑帮的种种罪行。我们坚信，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，我们一定能将以周扬为首的文艺黑线和文艺黑帮统统打倒！一定能将伟大的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
