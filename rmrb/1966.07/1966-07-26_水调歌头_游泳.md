Just drank the water of Changsha, now eating the fish of Wuchang. Crossing the ten-thousand-mile Yangtze River, gazing far into the sky of Chu. Unconcerned with the wind and waves, it's like strolling in a courtyard. Today, I have leisure. As Confucius said by the river: "Time passes like this!"

The sails billow, the tortoise and snake are still, great plans are rising. One bridge spans north and south, the river becomes a thoroughfare. Additionally, erect a stone wall on the West River, cutting off the clouds and rain of Wushan, creating a vast lake. The goddess should be fine, it will astonish the world.

    水调歌头  游泳
    才饮长沙水，又食武昌鱼。万里长江横渡，极目楚天舒。不管风吹浪打，胜似闲庭信步，今日得宽余。子在川上曰：逝者如斯夫！　风樯动，龟蛇静，起宏图。一桥飞架南北，天堑变通途。更立西江石壁，截断巫山云雨，高峡出平湖。神女应无恙，当惊世界殊。
