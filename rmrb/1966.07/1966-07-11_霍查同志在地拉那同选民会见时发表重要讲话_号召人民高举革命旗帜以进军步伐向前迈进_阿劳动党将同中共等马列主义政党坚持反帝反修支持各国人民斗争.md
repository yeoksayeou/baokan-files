Comrade Enver Hoxha, the beloved leader of the Albanian people and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, met with voters from the 200th electoral district who nominated him as a candidate for the Albanian People's Assembly on the evening of the 8th at the Cultural Palace in Tirana. He received a warm welcome from the voters. Comrade Hoxha delivered an important speech at the meeting, which was frequently interrupted by thunderous applause.

At 6 p.m. on the 8th, Comrade Hoxha, accompanied by members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Labour Party, the First Secretary of the Tirana Municipal Committee, M. Muftiu, and the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Tirana People's Assembly, A. Kelaizi, arrived at the grand hall of the Cultural Palace. The voters stood up and applauded warmly, shouting slogans such as "Long live the Albanian Party of Labour!" and "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!"

After M. Muftiu delivered the opening remarks, Comrade Hoxha walked onto the stage amidst warm applause and delivered a lengthy speech to the voters.

In his speech, Comrade Hoxha expressed his deep gratitude to the voters of the 200th electoral district for nominating him as a candidate for the People's Assembly and for their trust in him. He then discussed some major issues related to the current socialist revolution and socialist construction in Albania and analyzed the current international situation.

When Comrade Hoxha mentioned that the Albanian people and the Albanian Party of Labour stand shoulder to shoulder with glorious People's China and the great Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong in the forefront of the struggle for freedom, democracy, peace, socialism, and communism, the entire audience stood up and shouted slogans such as "Enver-Mao Zedong" and "Friendship is the guarantee."

Comrade Hoxha stated in his speech that the Albanian Party of Labour will stand united with the Communist Party of China and other Marxist-Leninist parties and revolutionaries, forever holding high the banner of struggle against imperialism, against the modern revisionism of Khrushchev and Tito, and fully supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries for liberation and against imperialism. He called on the Albanian people to forever hold high the revolutionary banner of the Party of Labour, to march forward with the steps of an advancing army, to mobilize, to complete the tasks of the first year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970), to further deepen the ideological and cultural revolution in all aspects, to further deepen the revolutionary ideas contained in the Party's documents, and to advance the cause of building socialism, defending the motherland, strengthening the people's power, the alliance between workers and peasants, and the iron-like unity between the people and the Party.

Comrade Hoxha's speech was repeatedly interrupted by prolonged, warm applause. Shouts of praise for the Albanian Party of Labour and Comrade Enver Hoxha echoed throughout the hall.

After Comrade Hoxha finished his speech, he walked down from the platform to shake hands, embrace, and have cordial conversations with the voters, receiving warm cheers from all the voters.

Representatives of the voters who participated in the meeting also spoke, expressing their heartfelt love and trust for their beloved leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and pledging to unanimously vote for the candidates of the Democratic Front and for Comrade Enver Hoxha in the elections on July 10.

Other party and government leaders from Albania who attended the meeting included B. Balluku, H. Toska, R. Alia, S. Kolega, K. Haxhiu, P. Dum, and the Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly, H. List.
