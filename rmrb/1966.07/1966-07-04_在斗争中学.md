	Learning Through Struggle
	Deputy Squad Leader Zhao Zhenglong

	The struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology will be a long and arduous one, and this heavy responsibility will fall on our shoulders, us young people who lack experience. How do we accomplish this great historical task? Chairman Mao teaches us: "Learn war through war—this is our main method."

	Chairman Mao here assigns us a combat mission: to go to the front lines of class struggle to learn about class struggle, just as revolutionary forerunners learned to fight through one battle after another. This reminds me of my experience learning to resist waves. At first, I only practiced in a still bay, but no matter how much I practiced, I couldn't master it. Later, I heeded the advice of my senior comrades and bravely followed them into the heart of Lake Tai, braving the strong winds and waves several times, before I began to understand the trick. After multiple practices, I gradually grasped the patterns of the waves and learned the skill of resisting them. I realized: to conquer the waves, one must not fear the waves and dare to venture into the strong winds and waves, daring to face them head-on. The stronger the winds and waves, the faster one learns and the deeper the experience. Isn't this the same for the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution? Staying indoors is not enough, standing on the shore is not enough, even if you enter the water, you must not passively endure the waves. You must actively and bravely plunge into the strong winds and waves, go to the most intense battlefields, and only then can you undergo the strictest tests and tempering. Since participating in the Cultural Revolution, our ability to identify and criticize class enemies has greatly improved, which is the best proof.

	Learning to struggle through struggle is actually an embodiment of Chairman Mao's teaching that knowledge comes from practice. Our participation in the Cultural Revolution is like conducting investigations and research in the midst of class struggle, understanding the life-and-death struggle between the two ideologies, so that we can be more vigilant and wiser in fighting against all class enemies.

	In the long and complex class struggle, as long as we have a clear direction and resolve to roll in the waves of struggle, getting dirty and even shedding blood, we will definitely grow rapidly and truly become reliable successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution!

    在斗争中学
    副班长　赵正龙
    无产阶级思想要跟资产阶级思想长年累月地斗下去，这副阶级的重担将要落到我们这些缺少经验的青年人身上。怎样来完成这个伟大的历史任务呢？毛主席教导我们：“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。”
    毛主席在这里向我们提出了一个战斗任务，就是到阶级斗争的第一线去学习阶级斗争，正象革命老前辈通过一次一次的实战锻炼学会打仗一样。这使我想起了自己学习抗浪本领的经过。开头我只是在死水湾里学动作，学来学去学不会。后来我听从了老同志的劝告，大胆跟着他们到太湖中央的大风大浪里去闯了几次，才闯出了点门道。以后又经过多次实践，才逐步摸到风浪的规律，学到抗浪的本领。我体会到：要想战胜风浪，就得不怕风浪，敢到大风大浪里去闯，敢和它面对面地斗。越是大风大浪，学得越快，体验越深。对于当前这场无产阶级文化大革命，不也是这样吗？关在房子里不行，站在岸上不行，就是下了水，不去主动战胜风浪也不行。必须主动地、奋勇地投身到大风大浪里去，到战斗最激烈的地方去，才能经受到最严格的考验和锻炼。从参加文化大革命以来，我们对牛鬼蛇神的识别能力和批判能力大大提高，就是一个最好的说明。
    在斗争中学习斗争，实际上是体现了毛主席教导我们的认识来自实践的观点。我们参加文化大革命，等于是到阶级斗争中去搞调查研究，弄清楚两种意识形态之间的生死搏斗究竟是怎么一回事，以便更警惕更机智地同一切牛鬼蛇神斗。
    在长期的复杂的阶级斗争中，只要我们方向明确，下定决心到斗争的风浪里去滚它几身泥，染它几身血，我们就一定能够飞快成长，真正成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人！
