Hanoi newspapers on the 23rd all published on the first page in prominent positions the full text of the statement issued by Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the People's Republic of China on the 22nd and the telegram sent by Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhu De, on the same day to Chairman Long Zheng of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. They also published editorials, warmly welcoming Chairman Liu's statement and Chairman Zhu's telegram.

The editorial titled "A Strong Dependence, A Great Support" in the Vietnamese newspaper *Nhan Dan* said: "Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement is a strong, fighting support from the seven hundred million brothers of the Chinese people to our people. It is also a stern warning to the American aggressors. This statement, along with the telegram from Chairman Zhu De, the statement of the Chinese government on July 3, 1966, and the recent mass rallies and demonstrations of tens of millions of Chinese people in support of Vietnam, once again demonstrate the enthusiasm and strong support of the Chinese Communist Party, the National People's Congress of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people for our people."

The editorial emphasized that in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation, the Vietnamese people have consistently received strong support and immense help from the Chinese people in various aspects. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the great seven hundred million Chinese people are wholeheartedly supporting the just cause of the Vietnamese people and wholeheartedly aiding the Vietnamese people in defeating the American aggressors. Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement makes the Vietnamese people feel even more deeply the close relationship between the two countries and the determination of the Chinese people to support and aid the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression for national salvation until final victory. China has always been a broad and strong rear base for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation.

The editorial titled "The Most Solemn Declaration, The Most Thorough Support" in the *New Vietnam-China News* on the 23rd said: "Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement, filled with the spirit of proletarian internationalism, is a stern warning to the American imperialists who are plotting to expand their aggression against Vietnam and pursuing a policy of aggression and war in Asia; it is a powerful, thorough, and precious support and encouragement to the thirty-one million Vietnamese people who are resolutely fighting a long-term war to completely defeat the American aggressors; it is a blow to the heads of all the ghosts and snakes and modern revisionists in the international arena who are actively peddling the 'peace talks' plot of American imperialism."

The editorial said that the Chinese government and people have consistently, in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, firmly supported the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American imperialist aggression. Chairman Mao Zedong's great statement of August 29, 1963, called on the working class, revolutionary people, and progressive people of the whole world to stand on the side of the Vietnamese people, to respond to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call, and to support the just struggle of the heroic people of South Vietnam. This statement played a decisive role in promoting the struggle of the people of the world to aid Vietnam and oppose America, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary people of the world, and inspiring the Vietnamese people on the front line of the struggle against American imperialism to seize even greater and more thorough victories with even more confidence.

The editorial said, "The statements issued by the Chinese government over the years to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and the massive demonstrations held by the Chinese people to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression have repeatedly expressed the iron will of the great seven hundred million Chinese people to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation until final victory."

The newspapers in Hanoi also reported prominently on the news of the nearly one million people in Beijing holding a grand rally and demonstration in support of Vietnam and against American aggression on the 22nd.

    河内各报发表社论盛赞中国无产阶级国际主义精神
    刘主席声明是对越南人民强有力的支持
    对国际上为美帝效劳的一切牛鬼蛇神和修正主义者是当头一棒
    新华社河内二十三日电　河内市各报二十三日都在第一版以显著地位全文刊登了中华人民共和国主席刘少奇二十二日发表的声明和人大常委会委员长朱德同日给越南民主共和国国会常务委员会主席长征的电报，并且纷纷发表社论，热烈欢迎刘主席的声明和朱委员长的电报。
    越南《人民报》在一篇题为《坚强的依靠，伟大的支持》的社论中说：“刘少奇主席的声明是七亿兄弟的中国人民对我国人民的战斗的强有力的支持，同时也是对美国侵略者的严厉警告。这项声明，以及朱德委员长的电报、中国政府一九六六年七月三日的声明和数以百万计的中国人民最近举行的支持越南的集会和示威游行，再一次显示了中国共产党、中国全国人民代表大会、中国政府和中国人民对我国人民的热情和强有力的支持。”
    社论强调说，越南人民在抗美救国斗争中，一贯得到兄弟的中国人民从各方面给予的强有力的支持和十分巨大的帮助。伟大的七亿中国人民在以毛主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，全心全力地支持越南人民的正义事业，全心全力地支援越南人民去战胜美国侵略强盗。刘少奇主席的声明，使得越南人民更加深切地体会到越中两国的密切关系和中国人民支持和援助越南人民进行抗美救国斗争直到彻底胜利的决心。中国一贯都是越南人民抗美救国斗争的广大和坚强的后方。
    《新越华报》二十三日在一篇题为《最庄严的声明，最彻底的支援》的社论中说：“刘少奇主席的这一充满无产阶级国际主义精神的声明，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民对加紧策划扩大侵略越南战争阴谋、在亚洲推行侵略政策和战争政策的美帝国主义的最有力、最严重的警告；是对在坚决为彻底打败美国侵略者而进行长期抗战的三千一百万越南人民的极其有力、极其彻底的和极其宝贵的支持和鼓舞；是对积极为美帝国主义兜售‘和谈’阴谋的国际上一切牛鬼蛇神和现代修正主义者的当头一棒。”
    社论说，中国政府和人民一贯本着无产阶级国际主义精神，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民反对美帝国主义的侵略。毛泽东主席一九六三年八月二十九日发表的伟大声明，号召全世界工人阶级、革命人民和进步人士，都站到越南人民一边，响应胡志明主席的号召，支援英勇的越南南方人民的正义斗争。这一声明对于全世界人民援越反美斗争起了决定性的推进作用，大大地长了全世界革命人民的志气，鼓舞了在反对美帝国主义最前线的越南人民更加信心百倍地夺取更伟大、更彻底的胜利。
    社论说，“中国政府历年来为支持越南人民反美斗争发表的声明和全中国人民多次为支援越南人民反美斗争举行的气势磅礴的示威游行，都一再表达了伟大的七亿中国人民坚决支援越南人民抗美救国斗争直到最后完全胜利的钢铁般的意志。”
    河内市各报二十三日还以显著地位，报道了北京市近百万群众二十二日举行声势浩大的援越抗美集会和示威游行的消息。
