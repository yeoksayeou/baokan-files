The facts of the development of the textile industry in our country show that the more Mao Zedong Thought there is in the minds of the broad masses of workers, the more vigorous the revolutionary spirit will be, and the more miracles will be created in production practice.

In the first half of this year, our country's textile industry has created new and higher records in product quantity, quality, variety, and labor productivity. The production of major products such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, woolen fabrics, chemical fibers, and textile machinery has increased significantly; the quality of various textile products has been significantly improved; the variety of colors and styles has increased significantly; textile mills across the country have actively faced the countryside and produced 36 billion yards of durable cotton cloth for 500 million peasants; the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution has flourished, and tens of thousands of large and small innovation projects have been successfully created.

This year, textile workers across the country have launched a more extensive and in-depth movement to learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. Especially after the national textile industry system established Yang Ruzhen, Wu Guixian, and Jie Yue as three red banners for learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, it has greatly promoted the in-depth development of the movement to learn and apply Chairman Mao's works among textile enterprise workers across the country. They firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, and class consciousness has generally been raised, revolutionary spirit is more vibrant, "for the revolution, for the people to spin and weave," has become the common slogan of action for the workers.

Textile mills across the country have organized "three-in-one" teams this year to go to the countryside, live and work among the poor and lower-middle peasants, investigate the needs of the peasants, and produce a batch of new patterned cloth that reflects the spirit of the times according to the needs of the peasants, as well as woolen fabrics, new blue cloth, gray cloth, and blue-gray cloth that peasants like.

Cotton spinning, woolen spinning, and chemical fiber industries have also developed many new colors and styles. At present, the main varieties of chemical fiber blended fabrics in our country are basically complete, whether it is deep color, light color, printed, thick woven, or thin woven, all can be produced in large quantities to supply the domestic and foreign markets.

In the past, textile mills often considered cost, profit, and technology more when solving the quality problems of some products, and considered politics less. This year, through the study of Chairman Mao's works, workers have realized that to improve product quality, the first thing to solve is the question of responsibility to whom. They said that some factories pursue enterprise profits, which is the capitalist management idea at work, and is the reflection of class struggle in the enterprise. In order to be responsible to the broad consumers and provide more cheap and good textile products for the people, textile workers have criticized wrong ideas and practices, and at the same time adopted some new technologies, pre-shrinking the cotton cloth, reducing the shrinkage rate of printed and dyed fabrics and colored woven fabrics from the original 5% to 8% to 2% to 3%.

The great Mao Zedong Thought not only points out the political direction for textile workers but also adds strong revolutionary will and creative wisdom, making them fearless, daring to break superstitions, and boldly becoming the masters of science and technology. Especially in this serious class struggle of the current cultural revolution, textile workers have stood out, smashed the bourgeois "authority," and established proletarian authority, creating many technological innovation achievements. The Qingdao Dyeing Factory's printing and dyeing technology, in the past, was monopolized by some technical "experts" who did not allow workers to intervene, wasting tens of thousands of pounds of waste slurry every year. During the cultural revolution, workers broke the superstition of technical "authority," dared to think and do, relied on collective wisdom, and quickly mastered the slurry configuration technology, reducing the waste slurry by 90% compared to the past. The young workers of our country's chemical fiber industry also broke the foreign framework, successfully researched the new dyeing technology of dyeing before weaving chemical fiber fabrics, changing the old technology of dyeing after spinning used in the printing and dyeing industry, making it easier to dye artificial cotton, artificial wool, and artificial silk that are relatively difficult to dye.

### 活学活用毛主席著作为革命为人民纺纱织布　纺织工业职工创造生产新纪录

　　活学活用毛主席著作为革命为人民纺纱织布
　　纺织工业职工创造生产新纪录
    据新华社十四日讯　我国纺织工业发展的事实表明，广大工人群众头脑中的毛泽东思想越多，革命精神就越旺盛，在生产实践上就越能创造奇迹。
    今年上半年，我国纺织工业在产品产量、质量、品种和劳动生产率等方面，都创造了新的、更高的纪录。棉纱、棉布、呢绒、化学纤维、纺织机械等主要产品的产量，都大幅度增长；各种纺织品质量有了显著提高；花色品种增加了很多；各地纺织厂积极面向农村，为五亿农民生产了三十六亿尺结实耐穿的棉布；技术革新和技术革命群众运动蓬勃发展，创造成功了成千上万个大大小小革新项目。
    今年各地纺织工业职工掀起了更广泛更深入的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。特别是在全国纺织工业系统树立了杨富珍、吴桂贤、解悦三位活学活用毛主席著作的红旗之后，更给各地纺织企业职工深入开展活学活用毛主席著作运动以很大的推动。他们牢牢记住毛主席的教导，阶级觉悟普遍提高，革命精神更加振奋，“为革命，为人民纺纱织布”，已经变成了职工们共同的行动口号。
  各地纺织厂今年协同商业部门组织了三结合队伍上山下乡，到贫下中农中蹲点、劳动、调查农民的需要，根据农民的要求设计、生产了一批反映时代精神面貌的新图案花布，以及农民喜爱的半线和全纱线呢、新蓝布、毛青布、毛蓝布等。
    棉纺织、毛纺织、化学纤维工业也搞了许多新的花色品种。目前我国主要的化学纤维的混纺织物品种已基本齐全，不论是深色、浅色、印花、厚织物、薄织物，都能大量生产，供应国内外市场。
    过去纺织厂解决某些产品的质量问题，往往是从成本、利润、技术上考虑多，从政治上考虑少。今年职工们通过学习毛主席著作，认识到提高产品质量，首先要解决对谁负责的问题。他们说，有些工厂追求企业利润，这是资本主义经营思想在作怪，是阶级斗争在企业里的反映。为了对广大消费者负责，给人民提供更多价廉物美的纺织品，纺织工人批判了错误观点和做法，同时采取了一些新工艺，对棉布进行预缩处理，使印染布、色织布的缩水率由原来百分之五到百分之八，减为百分之二到百分之三。
    伟大的毛泽东思想不仅给纺织工人指明了前进的政治方向，也给他们增添了坚强的革命毅力和创造智慧，使他们变得无所畏惧，敢于破除迷信，勇于做科学技术的主人。特别在当前这场文化大革命的严重阶级斗争中，纺织工人更是挺身而出，大破资产阶级“权威”，大树无产阶级权威，创造成功了许许多多技术革新成果。青岛印染厂采用的印花煮浆工艺，过去一直是由一些技术“专家”垄断煮浆配料技术，不让工人插手，一年要浪费上万斤的废浆。在文化大革命中，工人破除了对技术“权威”的迷信，敢想敢干，依靠集体的智慧，很快就成功地掌握了煮浆配料技术，使废浆比原来减少百分之九十。我国年青的化学纤维工业的工人也打破洋框框，研究成功化学纤维织物先染后织的染色新工艺，改变了印染工业惯用的先纺后染的旧工艺，使比较难上色的人造棉、人造毛和人造丝染色更鲜艳。
