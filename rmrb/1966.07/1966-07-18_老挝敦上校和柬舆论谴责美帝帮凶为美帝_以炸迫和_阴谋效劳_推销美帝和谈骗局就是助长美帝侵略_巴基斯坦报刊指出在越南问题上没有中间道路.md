Laotian Colonel Dong and Cambodian public opinion condemn American imperialist henchmen for serving the U.S. "bomb to force peace" conspiracy. Pushing the U.S. peace talks hoax is to aid U.S. aggression. Pakistani publications point out there is no middle road on the Vietnam issue.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Kengtung, July 16: On July 15, Colonel Dong, commander-in-chief of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces, spoke to Xinhua News Agency correspondent, severely condemning the Indian government's so-called "seven-point proposal" for the U.S. "bomb to force peace" conspiracy.

Colonel Dong pointed out: "The Indian government's so-called seven-point proposal is actually to make the Vietnamese people lay down their arms, allowing American aggressors to occupy South Vietnam long-term, turning it into an American colony and base for aggression. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's so-called seven-point proposal is actually serving American imperialism's occupation of Vietnam. It is part of the U.S. aggression plan and can only aid American imperialism in its unrestrained aggression."

Colonel Dong expressed complete agreement and firm support for the Chinese government's solemn statement issued on July 3. He said, "The Chinese government's stance is just and reasonable."

He pointed out: "As a loyal comrade-in-arms of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people regard supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation as a sacred internationalist duty. No matter what sacrifices are made or what risks are taken, the Chinese people will fully support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. This is a great support and encouragement for the Vietnamese people in their struggle for victory against U.S. aggression for national salvation."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, July 16: Today (July 16), the Cambodian newspaper "Pawisha" published an article titled "No One Believes Imperialism and Its Running Dogs," exposing Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's service to the imperialist "bomb to force peace" conspiracy.

The article pointed out that American imperialism does not abide by existing agreements, and Gandhi still demands the convening of new meetings, which is precisely to obstruct the Vietnamese people's liberation struggle. The article said: "No one will believe Gandhi's propaganda!"

The article emphasized: "The powerful stick of the Vietnamese people has already and is striking them, and will give them even heavier blows, leaving them no room to defend themselves. Thus, American imperialism instigates its puppets, such as its main puppet Gandhi, to go everywhere to lobby, call for, and shout for peace talks, serving as a shield and cover for American imperialism to deceive international public opinion, attempting to make people mistakenly believe that American imperialism loves peace."

According to Xinhua News Agency: On July 13, the Pakistani newspaper "Construction Daily" published an editorial exposing the Yugoslav Tito clique and the Indian ruling clique's service to the American imperialist "peace talks" hoax.

The editorial said that ignoring Vietnam's actual situation and talking about "peace and reconciliation" is actually not distinguishing between the aggressor and the victim.

The editorial said: "In Vietnam, implementing compromise means acknowledging the U.S. occupation of South Vietnam. Therefore, under the current situation, the proposal for reconciliation means supporting the U.S. aggressors."

The East Pakistan "People's Weekly" published an editorial on July 7 saying: "American imperialists bombing Hanoi and Haiphong have already broken all boundaries of the Vietnam War. From now on, how the war is fought and when it will end will no longer be solely up to them." The editorial said: "Not only for the people of China, but also for the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other parts of the world who love peace and freedom, there is only one path before them: either stand with the Vietnamese people or oppose the Vietnamese people. This is a stern test. There is no middle road."

　　老挝敦上校和柬舆论谴责美帝帮凶为美帝“以炸迫和”阴谋效劳
　　推销美帝和谈骗局就是助长美帝侵略
　　巴基斯坦报刊指出在越南问题上没有中间道路
    据新华社康开十六日电　老挝爱国中立力量总指挥敦上校十五日对新华社记者发表谈话，严厉谴责印度政府提出的为美国“以炸迫和”阴谋效劳的所谓“解决越南问题”的七点建议。
    敦上校指出：“印度政府的所谓七点建议实际上就是要越南人民放下武器，让美国侵略者长期占领南越，把它变成美国的殖民地和侵略基地。印度总理甘地夫人的所谓七点建议实际上是为美帝国主义侵占越南效劳的，它是美国整个侵略计划的一部分，只能助长美帝国主义为所欲为地进行侵略。”
    敦上校表示完全同意和坚决支持中国政府七月三日发表的严正声明。他说，中国政府的立场是正义的和合理的。
    他指出：“作为越南人民的忠实战友，中国人民把支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争看成是自己应尽的神圣的国际主义义务；不管要付出多大牺牲、冒多大风险，中国人民将全力支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。这对越南人民争取抗美救国斗争的胜利是一种巨大的支持和鼓舞。”
    据新华社金边十六日电　柬埔寨《帕威夏报》今天（十六日）发表了题为《没有人相信帝国主义及其走狗》的评论，揭露印度总理甘地夫人为帝国主义“以炸迫和”的阴谋效劳。
    评论指出，美帝国主义不遵守已经存在的协议，甘地夫人还要求召开新的会议，这正是为了阻挠越南人民的解放斗争。评论说：“谁也不会相信甘地夫人的这种宣传！”
    评论强调指出：“越南人民的有力的大棒已经而且正在打击他们，并且还将给他们以更加沉重的打击，使他们没有招架的余地。于是美帝国主义唆使自己的傀儡，例如它的主要傀儡甘地夫人到处去游说，发出呼吁和叫嚷和平谈判，充当美帝国主义的挡箭牌和黑幕，以便欺骗国际舆论，企图使人错信美帝国主义是爱和平的。”
    据新华社讯　巴基斯坦《建设报》十三日发表社论，揭露南斯拉夫铁托叛徒集团和印度统治集团为美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局效劳。
    社论说，不顾越南的实际情况而谈论“和平与和解”，实际上是对侵略者和被侵略者不加区别。
    社论说：“在越南实行妥协只能意味着承认美国对南越的占领。因此，在目前情况下，关于和解的建议意味着支持美国侵略者。”
    东巴基斯坦《人民》周刊七月七日发表社论说：“美帝国主义者轰炸河内和海防，已经打破了越南战争的一切界限。从今以后，战争怎样打和什么时候打下去，将不是单单取决于他们了。”社论说：“不仅对人民中国来说，而且对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲以及世界其他地方的爱好和平与自由的人民来说，在他们前面只有一条道路：要么站在越南人民一边，要么反对越南人民。这是一个严峻的考验。中间道路是没有的。”
