On the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the founding of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, and under the new situation of the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, Shenyang City held a grand second "Shenyang Music Week."

The music week was grandly inaugurated on the evening of July 1st. More than 4,000 people participated in this music week, with 75% of them being workers, peasants, and soldiers from various parts of Liaoning Province. Among them, many are model workers, advanced workers, and active learners of Chairman Mao's works. The workers, peasants, and soldiers who participated in the performance were full of revolutionary enthusiasm, loudly singing praises to the glorious, correct, and great Communist Party of China, singing praises to the great leader Chairman Mao, singing praises to the great socialist motherland and the workers, peasants, and soldiers heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and expressing their determination to join revolutionary music workers to make this music week a great demonstration against all bourgeois "authorities" and "experts," and a great counterattack against the anti-party and anti-socialist clique.

The opening ceremony began with a grand chorus of "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Sing the East Is Red." More than 500 workers, peasants, and soldiers amateur singers formed a chorus team, loudly singing "East Is Red," "The Great Ship Sails with the Helmsman," and "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China." Famous labor models or active learners of Chairman Mao's works such as Wang Chonglun, Li Suwen, Zheng Daiyu, Shen Sujuan, and Chu Zhonggui stood at the forefront of the chorus. Their performances were full of revolutionary spirit and fully expressed the people's love for the Party and Chairman Mao.

The chorus team of 100 workers over 40 years old from Shenyang Bright Mechanical Factory sang "The Workers Are Hard-Boned" and other songs with the heroic spirit of the working class, standing tall and singing loudly. This old workers' chorus team was developed in the struggle to use revolutionary songs to compete with the bourgeoisie for the younger generation and in the struggle to oppose decadent music.

The opening ceremony also featured a unique "Steel Pipe Ensemble." The instruments used in this program were made by Anshan Steel workers using seamless steel pipes they produced themselves. Playing "The Workers Are Hard-Boned" and "Socialism Is Good" with it, the tunes were especially powerful and clear. The audience was deeply moved by this performance, which deeply reflected the iron will of Anshan Steel workers. Anshan Steel workers produced the new product "Contend for Honor" seamless steel pipes, breaking the economic blockade imposed by imperialism and modern revisionism on our country, greatly boosting the morale of the working class, ensuring our country's industrial and national defense construction, and supporting the world revolution.

Another moving performance was the chorus "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao" led by Li Suwen, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a model worker in the national finance and trade sector. This chorus continued under the accompaniment of the audience's applause, creating a touching scene of unity between the stage and the audience.

The amateur performance team of a certain unit of the PLA performed "Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Works," describing the touching story of soldiers in a company studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

On that evening, 70% of the programs performed by workers, peasants, and soldiers, with more than 1,300 people participating in the performance. At the end of the evening, under the accompaniment of majestic military music, the stage and the audience together loudly sang "Cultural Revolution Vanguard." The entire venue also raised their arms and shouted: "Never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought." The opening ceremony ended with the enthusiastic slogan "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

The second "Shenyang Music Week" had such a powerful workers, peasants, and soldiers music team on the revolutionary music stage, singing the battle songs of the times. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and the result of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Liaoning Province taking the initiative to occupy the cultural positions of the proletariat. They regard literature and art as weapons to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy. Together with professional music workers, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and relevant articles on the current cultural revolution. They created, performed, wrote big-character posters to expose the crimes of the anti-party clique, and wrote articles to sing the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. They armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, making every song they created and performed, and every article they wrote, a more accurate and powerful bullet aimed at the enemy.

During the music week, Shenyang City will see a broader and deeper wave of mass singing of revolutionary songs. The music week will take factories, units, and fields as the main stages, with many performances and dozens of small-scale performances held on the production frontline, ensuring that all performances are first seen by workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are reviewed and appraised by them.

    第二届“沈阳音乐周”“七一”隆重揭幕
    工农兵登台歌颂共产党歌颂毛主席
    据新华社沈阳三日电　在纪念伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党诞生四十五周年的时候，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，沈阳市举行了规模盛大的第二届“沈阳音乐周”。
    音乐周是在七月一日晚上隆重揭幕的。参加这届音乐周演出的有四千多人，其中来自辽宁各地的工农兵群众占百分之七十五。他们当中，不少人是劳动模范、先进工作者和学习毛主席著作的积极分子。参加演出的工农兵群众满怀革命豪情，高声歌唱光荣、正确、伟大的中国共产党，歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席，歌颂伟大的社会主义祖国和用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵英雄人物，并且表示决心同革命的音乐工作者一起，把这届音乐周作为对一切资产阶级“权威”、“专家”的大示威，向反党反社会主义黑帮的大反击。
    音乐周的开幕式以气势磅礴的大联唱《工农兵齐唱东方红》揭开序幕。由五百多名工农兵业余歌手组成的合唱团，放声高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《没有共产党就没有新中国》。著名的劳动模范或学习毛主席著作积极分子王崇伦、李素文、郑代雨、沈素娟、初忠贵等，站在合唱队伍的最前列。他们的表演充满了革命的豪情，充分表达了全省人民对党和毛主席的敬爱心情。
    沈阳黎明机械厂一百名四十岁以上老工人组成的合唱团，以工人阶级的英雄气概，昂首挺胸，高唱了《工人阶级硬骨头》等歌曲。这个老工人合唱团，是在用革命歌曲同资产阶级争夺青年一代的斗争中，是在向糜糜之音进行针锋相对的斗争中发展起来的。
    开幕式上还演出了新颖别致的“钢管琴齐奏”。这个节目使用的乐器，是鞍钢工人用自己生产的无缝钢管制作的。用它演奏《工人阶级硬骨头》、《社会主义好》，音调格外铿锵有力，清脆响亮。观众们看到这场深刻反映鞍钢工人钢铁般坚强意志的演出，都十分激动。鞍钢工人生产了“争气牌”无缝钢管新产品，打破了帝国主义、现代修正主义对我国的经济封锁，大长工人阶级志气，保证了我国工业和国防建设，支援了世界革命。
    另一场激动人心的演唱，是毛主席著作学习积极分子、全国财贸职工六好标兵李素文领唱的《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》。这个大合唱，一直在观众掌声的伴奏下进行，出现了台上台下心连心的动人情景。
    解放军某部业余演出队演出的《学习毛主席著作讲用会》表演唱，描述一个连队的战士们活学活用毛主席著作的动人故事。
    当天晚会上，工农兵群众演出的节目占百分之七十，参加演出的群众有一千三百多人。晚会结束时，在雄伟的军乐伴奏声中，台上台下齐声高唱《文化革命打先锋》，全场还振臂高呼：念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。开幕式最后在“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的热烈的口号声中结束。
    第二届“沈阳音乐周”能有如此强大的一支工农兵音乐队伍登上革命音乐舞台，高唱时代的战歌，这是毛泽东文艺思想的伟大胜利，是辽宁省广大工农兵群众以主力军的战斗姿态占领无产阶级文化阵地取得的成果。他们把文艺当成团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的武器，他们和专业音乐工作者一起，反复学习了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和当前文化大革命的有关文章。他们一面创作，一面演出，一面写大字报揭发反党黑帮的罪恶，一面写文章歌颂无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。他们用毛泽东思想武装自己，使自己创作和演出的一曲曲歌，写的一篇篇文章，都能成为射向敌人的更准确更有力的子弹。
    在音乐周期间，沈阳市将出现一个更广泛更深入的群众性大唱革命歌曲的高潮。音乐周将把工厂、连队和田间作为主要舞台，将有许多场演出和几十次小型表演活动，在生产第一线进行，作到所有的演出首先让工农兵看，由工农兵审查鉴定。
