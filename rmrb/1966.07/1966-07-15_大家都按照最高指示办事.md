The two boards with Chairman Mao's quotations in our third squad were both meticulously crafted by comrade Liu Yingjun. To ensure that everyone in the squad acts according to the highest directive at all times and in all matters, he changes the quotation every few days. Each change is essentially a grasp of living thoughts.

This year, after the new recruits joined, a few senior comrades in the squad did not show enough care for them. Comrade Liu Yingjun noticed this and discussed with me the idea of writing the following quotation from Chairman Mao on the quotation board:

"All of us, regardless of our origin, have come together for a common revolutionary goal. ... All revolutionaries must care for, love, and help each other."

In the evening, he read this quotation to the entire squad. Comrade Wang Jiagao, who usually spoke loudly to the new recruits and sometimes had a poor attitude, was startled after seeing this quotation. He said, "If it weren't for reading this quotation, I would still think I was doing fine! Comparing myself with Chairman Mao's words, I realized I have not been acting according to the highest directive." Wang Jiagao proactively sought out the new recruits to have a heart-to-heart talk. The entire squad also began to pay more attention to helping each other politically and caring for each other in daily life.

Over the past year, Comrade Liu Yingjun has selected and written over a hundred quotations from Chairman Mao on topics such as class struggle, serving the people, people's war, criticism and self-criticism, hard work and simplicity, and unity. These quotations have timely helped the squad resolve real-life ideological issues and have strongly promoted the ideological transformation of everyone. We deeply feel that Comrade Liu Yingjun is indeed a resolute executor and a model propagandist of the highest directive.

　　大家都按照最高指示办事
　　班长　李洪记
    我们三班的两块毛主席语录板，都是刘英俊同志精心制作的。他为了让同志们时时、事事都按最高指示办事，隔几天就换一条语录，每换一次实际上就是抓了一次活思想。
    今年新战士下班以后，班里有个别老同志对他们关心不够。刘英俊同志发现后，就和我商量，在毛主席语录板上端端正正地写了这样一条语录：
      “我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”
    晚上，他又把这条语录读给全班同志听。战士王家好，平时对新同志说话嗓门大，有时态度不太好。他看到这条语录以后，吃惊地说：“要不是读了这条语录，我还觉得自己不错呢！和毛主席的话一对照，才发现我没有按照最高指示去做。”王家好主动找新同志交了心。全班同志也更加注意从政治上互相帮助、从生活上互相关心了。
    一年来，刘英俊同志先后选写了毛主席有关阶级斗争、为人民服务、人民战争、批评与自我批评、艰苦朴素、团结等语录一百多条，及时地帮助班里解决了现实思想问题，有力地促进了大家的思想革命化。我们深深地觉得，刘英俊同志不愧为最高指示的坚决执行者，也是最高指示的模范宣传员。
