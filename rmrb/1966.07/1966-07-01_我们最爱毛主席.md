	We love Chairman Mao the most,
	The Tianjin Clock Factory Workers' Amateur Choir

	High mountains and steep cliffs never end,
	We love Jingan Mountain the most,
	Chairman Mao raised the red flag on the mountain,
	The dark China saw the light of day.

	The Yangtze River and the Yellow River waves connect,
	We love the Yan River the most,
	Chairman Mao waved his mighty brush by the river,
	And drew a magnificent new China.

	Golden cities and silver cities shine brightly,
	We love Beijing the most,
	Chairman Mao ascended Tiananmen Gate,
	The five lakes and four seas are spring everywhere.

	Thousands of flags, tens of thousands of flags,
	We love the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought the most,
	We will forever follow Chairman Mao,
	Striding towards communism.

    我们最爱毛主席
    天津钟表厂工人业余合唱队高山峻岭望不断，我们最爱井冈山，毛主席在山上举红旗，黑暗的中国亮了天。长江大河波连波，我们最爱延水河，毛主席河边挥巨笔，画出了壮丽的新中国。金城银城放光明，我们最爱北京城，毛主席登上天安门，五湖四海处处春。千杆旗啊万杆旗，我们最爱毛泽东思想红旗，永远跟着毛主席，大步走向共产主义。
