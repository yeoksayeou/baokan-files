Syrian Representative Zadad Riqabi today said at the emergency conference of Asian and African writers that the great thought of Mao Zedong belongs not only to the Chinese people but to all the peoples of the world. The thought of Mao Zedong is the sunlight that illuminates the path for us and for all the peoples of the world who are struggling for progress and liberation.

He said, the victory of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation once again proves a truth expounded by Chairman Mao Zedong, that is, all reactionaries are paper tigers. Imperialism cannot frighten those who are steadfast and unyielding, even if they are attacked by tanks and airplanes. He firmly believes that the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialist aggression will be victorious, and all revolutionaries will smash American imperialism all over the world.

He said, the struggle of the Arab people to eliminate Israel and to enable the Palestinian Arab people to return to their homeland is not only for the peace of the Arab nation but also to eliminate the threat of colonialism and for the peace of Asia and Africa. He mentioned that imperialism is not only still trampling on some Arab countries but is also trying to weaken the already independent Arab countries.

Riqabi said, the peoples of Asia and Africa should concentrate our firepower, strengthen our struggle, and from the two continents of Asia and Africa and all places, permanently eliminate imperialism, no matter how many forms it takes, it cannot frighten us and will not be able to stop the peoples of various countries from advancing towards independence and freedom.

He spoke about the Asian and African countries resisting the poison and the decadent culture spread by Western colonialism that numbs people's souls, saying, the pen and the sword should fight side by side. Asian and African writers should fulfill their mission, raise the consciousness of the people, develop revolutionary national culture, and create a new culture that is linked with the purity of the nation.

    在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上
    叙利亚代表里卡比的发言
    新华社四日讯　叙利亚代表扎达特·里卡比今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，伟大的毛泽东思想不仅属于中国人民，而是属于所有各国人民的。毛泽东思想是为我们、为世界上所有争取进步和解放而斗争的人民照亮道路的阳光。
    他说，越南人民抗美救国斗争的胜利，再一次证实了毛泽东主席阐明过的一个真理，那就是一切所有号称强大的反动派统统不过是纸老虎。帝国主义绝对吓不倒那些坚贞不屈，即使用坦克、飞机向他们冲去也毫不卑躬屈膝的人。他坚信，越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争必胜，一切革命者将在世界各地粉碎美帝国主义。
    他说，阿拉伯人民为清除以色列和使巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民重返家园的斗争，不仅是为了阿拉伯民族的安宁，也是为了消除殖民主义的威胁，为了亚非的和平。他谈到，今天帝国主义不仅仍然蹂躏着一些阿拉伯国家，而且还在竭力削弱已经独立了的阿拉伯国家。
    里卡比说，我们亚非各国人民应该集中我们的火力，加强斗争，从亚非两大洲和一切地方，永远消灭帝国主义，不管帝国主义有多少种形式，都吓不倒我们，也绝不能阻止各国人民向独立与自由迈进。
    他谈到亚非国家抵制西方殖民主义所散布的毒害和麻醉人们心灵的颓废文化时说，笔和剑应该并肩战斗。亚非作家应该完成自己的使命，提高人民的觉悟，发展革命的民族文化，以便创造一个和民族的纯洁性相联系的新文化。
