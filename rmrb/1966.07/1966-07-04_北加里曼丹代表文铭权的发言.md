	North Kalimantan representative Wen Mingquan today at the emergency meeting of the Asian-African Writers' Conference said, the people of North Kalimantan have deeply felt from their own experiences that history is indeed progressing in the direction pointed out by Mao Zedong—the great leader of the world's people. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought will surely illuminate the entire world. He emphasized: "Without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no New China; without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no New North Kalimantan; without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no New World!"

	Wen Mingquan said, the people of North Kalimantan have found the path from the treasure trove of Mao Zedong Thought. They have come to understand: they must take up arms to resolutely fight imperialism to achieve true national liberation; they must mobilize the peasant masses and take root in the countryside, especially mobilize and take root among the extremely poor peasants of various ethnic groups who urgently demand revolution, make up the majority of the population, and are still in a very backward stage of social development; if they do not take root among the poorest peasants of various ethnic groups, they cannot advance according to the great strategic thought of surrounding the cities from the countryside; they must base themselves on the worker-peasant alliance and broadly unite the forces of all classes and ethnic groups that can be united, winning over more than 95% of the people to the side of the revolutionary forces.

	Wen Mingquan also emphasized that the people of North Kalimantan have come to understand: people's war has immense power. They know that the most important point of people's war is to fully utilize the brilliant truth of "man as the decisive factor." They also understand that revolutionary war is a struggle for liberation by the people themselves, and therefore, they must insist on self-reliance. They know that without self-reliance, the people cannot be tempered into heroic people, cannot persist in the long, tortuous, and arduous revolutionary struggle. Only through self-reliance can they withstand any risks and stand unshakable.

	He said, the current great upheaval is pushing the world revolution towards a process of great division and reorganization. The direction of the world's people is clearer, and people are more determined to take up arms to fight. The anti-imperialist world revolutionary united front against U.S. imperialism is purer and more resolute, and on this basis, it has expanded further. This is a process of further deepening the world's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle.

	He denounced the U.S. and British imperialists for imposing the "Malaysia" they conspired to create on the people of North Kalimantan, and condemned the crimes of the Rahman puppet clique in suppressing the people. He said, the awakened people of North Kalimantan have realized that only by taking up arms and resolutely fighting back against imperialism can they achieve true national liberation.

	He expressed full support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. He said, U.S. imperialism is not only a vicious enemy of the Vietnamese people but also a common enemy of the world's people. The more U.S. imperialism escalates its aggression in Vietnam, the more miserable its defeat will be. This so-called strongest imperialism in the world has already become the weakling in the face of the heroic Vietnamese people. The wise judgment that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger has been fully proven here. The people of North Kalimantan firmly support the Vietnamese people's demand for the unconditional immediate withdrawal of U.S. imperialism from Vietnam.

	Wen Mingquan condemned the Soviet revisionists for serving U.S. imperialism. He said, to oppose the imperialist camp led by U.S. imperialism, one must also oppose the revisionist camp led by Soviet revisionism. One cannot harbor illusions that the nature of the Soviet revisionist camp will change. He said, the general line of Soviet revisionism's domestic and foreign policies all stem from the privileged class that has emerged within the Soviet Union, and this privileged class is the new bourgeoisie of the Soviet Union. The Soviet revisionist leadership is the representative of this new bourgeoisie.

	He expressed his firm belief that the imperialist camp led by U.S. imperialism and the revisionist camp led by Soviet revisionism will ultimately fail.

	Wen Mingquan, in his speech, expressed complete support for the proposal made by the Indonesian representative, that China is a suitable venue for the Third Asian-African Writers' Conference.

    北加里曼丹代表文铭权的发言
    新华社三日讯　北加里曼丹代表文铭权今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，北加里曼丹人民从自己的亲身经历中深刻地体会到，历史正是按照毛泽东——世界人民伟大的领袖所指出的方向前进。毛泽东思想的光辉必将照耀全世界。他强调说：“没有毛泽东思想，就没有新中国；没有毛泽东思想，就没有新北加里曼丹；没有毛泽东思想，就没有新世界！”
    文铭权说，北加里曼丹人民从毛泽东思想的宝库中找到了道路。他们已经懂得：必须拿起武器向帝国主义作坚决的斗争，才能取得真正的民族解放；必须放手发动农民群众和扎根于农村之中，特别是放手发动和扎根于十分贫困、迫切要求革命、占人口最多、而且还停留在极为落后的社会发展阶段的各民族农民之中；不在最贫困的各民族农民中扎下根来，就不可能循着农村包围城市这个伟大的战略思想前进；必须以工农联盟为基础、广泛地团结一切可以团结的各阶级、各民族的力量，把百分之九十五以上的人民群众争取到革命力量这一边来。
    文铭权还强调说，北加里曼丹人民还懂得了：人民战争具有无比强大的威力。他们知道人民战争的最重要之点，就是最大限度地发挥“人的因素第一”这个光辉的真理的作用。他们也懂得了，革命战争是人民自身起来争取解放的斗争，因此，必须坚持自力更生。他们知道，不自力更生，人民就不能锻炼成为英雄的人民，就不能坚持长期曲折艰苦的革命斗争。只有自力更生，才能经得起任何风险，而立于不败之地。
    他说，目前大动荡的形势正把世界革命推向大分化、大改组的过程。世界人民方向更明确了，人们更坚定地拿起武器来进行斗争。反对美帝国主义的世界革命统一战线的队伍更纯洁更坚定了，并且在这个基础上更扩大了。这是世界反帝革命斗争进一步深入的过程。
    他控诉美、英帝国主义把他们合谋制造的“马来西亚”强加在北加里曼丹人民的头上，谴责拉赫曼傀儡集团镇压人民的罪行。他说，觉醒了的北加里曼丹人民认识到，只有拿起武器，向帝国主义作坚决的还击，才能取得真正的民族解放。
    他表示全力支持越南人民的正义斗争。他说，美帝国主义不仅是越南人民的凶恶敌人，也是世界人民的公敌。美帝国主义在越南的侵略越是“升级”，它失败得就越惨。这个号称世界上最强大的帝国主义，在英勇的越南人民面前，已经变成了弱者。美帝国主义是纸老虎这个英明的论断，在这里得到了充分的证明。北加里曼丹人民坚决支持越南人民要求美帝国主义无条件立即滚出越南的立场。
    文铭权谴责苏联修正主义者竭力为美帝国主义效劳。他说，要反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营，就必须反对以苏联修正主义为首的修正主义集团。决不能幻想苏联修正主义集团的本性会改变。他说，苏联修正主义内政、外交的总路线都是导源于苏联国内产生的特权阶层，而这个特权阶层，就是苏联的新资产阶级。苏联修正主义领导集团就是这个新资产阶级的代表。
    他表示坚信，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和以苏联修正主义为首的修正主义集团最终必将失败。
    文铭权在发言中表示完全支持印度尼西亚代表提出的建议，即中国是举行第三届亚非作家会议合适地点。
