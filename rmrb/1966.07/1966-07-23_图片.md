The Chinese people vow to be the backbone of the Vietnamese people! China is Vietnam's rear base! A grand rally and parade of a million people in the capital resolutely support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms and Chairman Liu Shaoqi's declaration.

The People's Liberation Army of China enthusiastically supports Chairman Liu Shaoqi's declaration and resolutely declares to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to strengthen war preparedness, and to be ready at any time to fight alongside the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat the evil American aggressors.

Vietnamese students in Beijing joined the capital's people in the parade, demonstrating the fighting friendship and unity between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, and expressing the Vietnamese people's determination to endure hardships and sacrifices and to decisively defeat the American invaders.

Workers from Beijing who participated in the rally and parade expressed their strong resolve to be the backbone of the Vietnamese people.

Members of the Sand River Sino-Vietnamese Friendship People's Commune who participated in the rally shouted: Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam!

The capital's militia who participated in the grand rally resolutely declared: Support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against the Americans to the end!
