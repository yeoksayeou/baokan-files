I read with deep respect the account of Comrade Liu Yingjun's heroic sacrifice in protecting the lives of the people. I am deeply moved. He is a hero like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Ouyang Hai, a model executor of the highest directives, and an excellent example for us to learn from. The appearance of hero Liu Yingjun once again strongly proves that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest, bravest, and most thorough materialists, possessing the greatest fighting spirit; in the era when workers, peasants, and soldiers grasp Mao Zedong Thought, heroes emerge in droves, and miracles are endless.

Liu Yingjun is a young soldier of only twenty-one years old. He was able to grow rapidly from the son of a poor peasant into a great communist warrior. The fundamental reason is that he diligently and earnestly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, firmly believed in the highest directives, loyally executed the highest directives, and voluntarily carried out the transformation of his thoughts to promote revolution and eliminate bourgeois ideology. He studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and in his actual actions, he sincerely and wholeheartedly served the people. He did good deeds without seeking fame, did not report them, and did not record them in his diary. He regarded such actions as "revolutionary practice" and the "touchstone for testing truth," using them to temper and transform himself, establishing a worldview of completely and thoroughly serving the people.

Comparing myself to Comrade Liu Yingjun, I fall far short. Previously, I always thought that having gone through gunfire and shelling, having endured hardships and trials of life and death in the first half of my life, I had firmly decided to follow the Party and resolutely make revolution. What major problems could there be with my worldview? Over the past decade or so since liberation, my thoughts have been quite stable. I often go deep into the company to stay and live with the soldiers, blending in with them, maintaining the character of an ordinary soldier, and my ideological transformation has been passable. Now the Party has entrusted me with the responsibility of leading the battalion. I need to find ways to lead everyone well and complete the tasks assigned by the Party. This is a big deal. As for some minor flaws in my thoughts, they are nothing to worry about; I can gradually change them. Because of this idea, I used Mao Zedong's works more in my work and less in transforming my thoughts. When talking to the soldiers about ideological revolutionization, I often unconsciously exclude myself. After learning about Comrade Liu Yingjun's heroic deeds, I received a profound education. As an old revolutionary soldier, why is my ideological awareness not as high as Comrade Liu Yingjun's? It is because I have not, like Comrade Liu Yingjun, consciously used Mao Zedong Thought to transform my own thoughts. This makes me realize more deeply: a revolutionary soldier, having contributed to the Party in the first half of his life, fearing neither hardship nor death, undoubtedly forms the basis for continuing the revolution. But the revolution in the first half of one's life does not equal the revolution in the second half. In the second half, one must "start anew from the beginning," and more seriously transform oneself, without any sense of superiority, without stopping or resting. Whoever slackens in ideological transformation will fall behind the times and become a captive of bourgeois ideology.

Why do I lack Comrade Liu Yingjun's firm and thorough spirit of self-revolution? Looking at Liu Yingjun's deeds, studying and comparing repeatedly, the fundamental reason is that I have not well studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and class contradictions in socialist society. My mind is weak in class struggle awareness, I have relaxed my vigilance against the enemy who does not carry guns, and I have not seen that the enemy who does not carry guns is attacking and corrupting our thoughts through various channels every day, attempting a "peaceful evolution." Not thoroughly transforming one's thoughts, being indulgent and lenient towards minor flaws, and not taking them seriously, is a manifestation of being corrupted by the enemy. Think about it, how dangerous this is! Liu Yingjun has set an example for me in this regard. He has the best understanding and application of Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle. He clearly recognizes the domestic and foreign class enemies and clearly recognizes the enemy of bourgeois ideology and selfish thoughts within his own mind. He knows that domestic and foreign class enemies cannot conquer us by force, so they collaborate with the enemy within people's minds, making people unknowingly and comfortably degenerate. In such a situation, only by truly using Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly transform oneself can one withstand the test of the great waves of class struggle and become a reliable successor to the cause of the proletarian revolution. Precisely because Comrade Liu Yingjun has a strong sense of class struggle, his urgency and awareness of transforming thoughts are very high and thorough. He can voluntarily take up the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to fight a close and annihilation battle against selfish thoughts, not even sparing a single thought that does not conform to the interests of the people.

The appearance of Liu Yingjun feels like a slap on my back. This slap has awakened me. An old revolutionary soldier should take Liu Yingjun as an example, read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, work for the revolution for a lifetime, and transform thoughts for a lifetime.

    学习刘英俊的彻底革命精神
    全国人民代表大会代表、解放军某部副团长　黄丑和
    我带着崇敬的心情，读了刘英俊同志为保护人民群众生命安全英勇献身的事迹，深深受到感动。他是雷锋、王杰、欧阳海式的英雄，是最高指示的模范执行者，是我们学习的好榜样。英雄刘英俊的出现，又一次强有力地证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人最聪明，最勇敢，是彻底的唯物主义者，是最大的战斗力；工农兵掌握毛泽东思想的时代，英雄辈出，奇迹无穷。
    刘英俊是个年仅二十一岁的青年战士，他能够从一个贫农的儿子迅速成长为一个伟大的共产主义战士，最根本的一条是他刻苦、勤奋地活学活用毛主席著作，坚定地信仰最高指示，忠实地执行最高指示，自觉地进行兴无灭资的思想改造。他学习了“老三篇”，在实际行动中就踏踏实实、诚心诚意地为人民服务。他做了好事不留名，不汇报，不在日记本里记载。他把这种行动看作是“革命的实践”，“检验真理的试金石”，以此来磨练和改造自己，树立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的无产阶级世界观。
    对照刘英俊同志，想想自己，差得很远。以前，我总觉得自己是从枪林弹雨里度过来的，前半辈子经受住了艰难困苦和生死的考验，坚决跟党走，坚决闹革命的心是定了，世界观还有什么大问题？解放十几年来思想也很稳定，经常深入连队蹲点，和战士打成一片，保持着普通一兵的本色，思想改造也算“过得去”了。现在党把团的责任交给了我，想办法把大家带领好，完成党交给的任务，是桩大事。至于思想上一些缺点，小毛病，没什么了不起的，慢慢改吧！因为有了这种想法，学习毛主席著作，用在工作上的多，用在改造思想上的少。和战士们讲思想革命化，往往不自觉地把自己划在圈外。学习了刘英俊同志的英雄事迹，使我受到了一次深刻的教育。自己是革命老战士，为什么思想觉悟却没有刘英俊同志那样高呢？就是因为没有象刘英俊同志那样，用毛泽东思想自觉地改造自己的思想。这使我更加深刻地认识到：一个革命战士，前半辈子对党有贡献，不怕苦，不怕死，无疑是今后继续革命的基础。但前半辈子革命不等于后半辈子革命，后半辈子仍要“而今迈步从头越”，更要认真改造，来不得半点“优越感”，停不得步，歇不得气。谁在思想改造上耍滑，谁就要落在形势后面，成为资产阶级思想的俘虏。
    为什么缺乏刘英俊同志那种坚定彻底的自我革命精神？看着刘英俊的事迹，反复学习，反复对照，最根本的原因，是自己没有很好地学习毛主席关于社会主义社会的阶级和阶级斗争的教导，脑子里阶级斗争观念淡薄，放松了对不拿枪的敌人的警惕，没有看到不拿枪的敌人在通过各种渠道，天天向我们进攻，腐蚀我们的思想，搞“和平演变”。思想改造不彻底，对小缺点迁就姑息，不以为然，就是被敌人腐蚀的表现。想想，这是多危险啊！刘英俊在这方面，为我做出了榜样。他对毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导，学得最好，用得最好。他对国内外阶级敌人认得清，对自己思想里的资产阶级思想、私心杂念这个敌人认得清。他知道，国内外的阶级敌人用武力征服不了我们，就和人们思想上的敌人搞里应外合，使人们不知不觉地、舒舒服服地变质。在这种情况下，只有真正用毛泽东思想彻底改造自己，才能够经得起阶级斗争这个大风大浪的考验，做无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。正因为刘英俊同志的阶级斗争观念强，改造思想的迫切性、自觉性就非常高，非常彻底。能自觉拿起批评与自我批评的武器，同私心杂念打“近战”，打歼灭战，那怕是一丝一毫不符合人民利益的念头，也决不放过。
    刘英俊的出现，我感到是在自己背上击了一掌。这一掌拍醒了我。一个老革命战士，更应该以刘英俊为榜样，读一辈子毛主席的书，干一辈子革命，改造一辈子思想。
