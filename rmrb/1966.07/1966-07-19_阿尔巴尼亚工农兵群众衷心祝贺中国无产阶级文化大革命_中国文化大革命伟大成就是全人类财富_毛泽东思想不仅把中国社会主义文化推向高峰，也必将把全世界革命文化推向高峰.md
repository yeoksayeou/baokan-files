The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Albania highly evaluate and heartily congratulate the great victories achieved in the Chinese socialist cultural revolution. They warmly praise the great Mao Zedong Thought that guides this movement and Mao Zedong himself, who personally leads this movement.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 17th: The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Albania highly evaluate and heartily congratulate the great victories achieved in the Chinese socialist cultural revolution. They warmly praise the great Mao Zedong Thought that guides this movement and Mao Zedong himself, who personally leads this movement.

A female worker at the Stalin Textile Combine, Labor Hero Lito, said: "The cultural revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong is a great contribution to world history. It points out the correct and great path to carry the socialist revolution to the end."

Lito told our reporter: "Mao Zedong's works tell us that after the proletariat seizes political power, class struggle and class contradictions still exist, especially in the ideological realm, where class struggle is extremely sharp and complex. The current struggle against all ghosts and monsters in China is a practical proof of this theory." She said: "The Chinese cultural revolution is unprecedented. This revolution will surely smash all kinds of ghosts and monsters to pieces and will further advance China's socialist revolution and socialist construction."

A worker at the Tirana State Construction Company, Socialist Labor Hero Mazniku, said: "The Chinese socialist cultural revolution not only cultivates a new generation with Marxist-Leninist fighting spirit and healthy thoughts for the present but also for the future. Literature and arts should reflect and sing the praises of heroes like Lei Feng and Wang Jie, who grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. Such heroes not only inspire the Chinese people but also inspire us."

He enthusiastically said: "Mankind sees hope from China. The great achievements of the Chinese socialist cultural revolution, guided by the brilliant theories of Chairman Mao, will become the wealth of all mankind and a powerful weapon to defeat the entire capitalist system."

A 65-year-old old member of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in the Berat District, Plaku, told our reporter: "The Chinese people, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, are united like a rock. Mao Zedong is the 'red sun' of the world's people, and nothing can shake this. Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party not only drive China forward but also drive the whole world forward." He said, "Under the leadership of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals actively participate in the cultural revolution, opposing capitalism, opposing Khrushchev's revisionism, and opposing a handful of ghosts and monsters. They will surely annihilate these enemies. He enthusiastically said: "Mao Zedong is the red sun of Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries. Imperialism and revisionism will surely perish under the rays of the red sun."

An art worker of the Albanian People's Army, an old guerrilla fighter, Perdo, said when talking about the Chinese cultural revolution: "Mao Zedong Thought not only pushes Chinese socialist culture to its peak but will also push the revolutionary culture of the whole world to its peak." After talking about the achievements of the Albanian People's Army's art work under the leadership of the Albanian Party and Comrade Hoxha, he said: "The Chinese cultural revolution is a great inspiration to the art workers of the Albanian People's Army. It will promote the development of the art work of the Albanian People's Army."

    斯大林纺织联合工厂女工、劳动英雄莉托说：“以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党所进行的这场文化大革命是对世界历史的重大贡献。它指明了把社会主义革命进行到底的正确的伟大的道路”。
    莉托对本社记者说：“毛泽东著作告诉我们，无产阶级取得政权以后，阶级和阶级斗争仍然存在，特别在思想领域中阶级斗争是十分尖锐和复杂的。目前在中国进行的反对一切牛鬼蛇神的斗争，正是这一理论的实际证明”。她说：中国文化大革命是史无前例的。这场革命必将把形形色色的牛鬼蛇神碾得粉碎，并把中国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设进一步推向前进。
    地拉那国营建筑公司工人、社会主义劳动英雄马兹尼库说：“中国社会主义文化大革命不仅为现在、而且为未来造就具有马克思列宁主义战斗精神和健康思想的新的一代。文艺应该反映、歌颂雷锋、王铁人等英雄人物在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的英雄事迹。这样的英雄不仅鼓舞中国人民，而且也鼓舞着我们”。
    他热情地说：“人类从中国那里看到了希望，有毛主席光辉的学说作指导的中国社会主义文化大革命的伟大成就，将成为整个人类的财富，成为战胜整个资本主义体系的有力武器”。
    阿尔巴尼亚贝拉特区阿中友好农业社六十五岁的老社员普拉库对本社记者说：以毛泽东同志为首的中国人民团结得象磐石一般。毛泽东是“全世界人民的红太阳”，没有任何力量能够动摇这一点。毛泽东和中国共产党不仅推动中国前进，而且也推动全世界前进。他说，中国工人、农民、革命知识分子在毛泽东和中国共产党领导下，积极参加文化大革命，反对资本主义、反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义，反对一小撮牛鬼蛇神，他们必将把这些敌人消灭。他热情地说：毛泽东是马克思列宁主义者、革命者的红太阳，帝国主义、修正主义在红色太阳的照射下，必然死亡。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军文艺工作干部、老游击队员珀多向本社记者谈到中国文化大革命时说：毛泽东思想不仅把中国的社会主义文化推向高峰，而且必将把全世界的革命文化推向高峰。他在谈到阿尔巴尼亚人民军文艺工作在阿尔巴尼亚党和霍查同志领导下取得的成就之后说：“中国文化大革命对阿尔巴尼亚人民军的文艺工作者是个巨大的鼓舞，它将促进阿尔巴尼亚人民军的文艺工作向前发展”。
