The General Political Department has issued a notice to launch a campaign throughout the military to propagate and study the example of Comrade Liu Yingjun.

The General Political Department pointed out that Comrade Liu Yingjun, through his actual deeds, responded to the call to treat Chairman Mao's works as the highest directive. He is a model executor of the highest directive and a model for all military personnel to learn from.

The notice from the General Political Department also states: "Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being carried out vigorously in our country. The Party Central Committee calls on us: we must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The Central Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao call on us to vigorously implement the five principles of emphasizing politics. Launching a campaign throughout the military to propagate and study the example of Comrade Liu Yingjun is of great significance in better implementing the directives of the Party Central Committee, the Military Commission, and Comrade Lin Biao, in promoting military personnel to actively participate in the Cultural Revolution, and in advancing the revolutionary construction of the military and strengthening preparedness."

Since liberation, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm has been extremely intense in our country. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently being carried out vigorously is a continuation of this struggle, pushing the socialist revolution in our country to a deeper and broader stage. This struggle, in essence, is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership. We must consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, while the bourgeoisie plots to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. This is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle.

Our military is the army of workers and peasants created and led by the Party and Chairman Mao, and it is an important tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must stand in the forefront of the struggle with the broad masses of workers and peasants, actively participate in the struggle, and resolutely counter all challenges from the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, every comrade in the military should become a proletarian revolutionary fighter like Liu Yingjun, armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We should be like him, loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, loyal to Chairman Mao, and loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. We should be like him, listen to Chairman Mao's words, listen to the Party's words, and wholeheartedly serve the people, socialism, and communism. We should be like him, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, treat Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive, dare to think, dare to speak, be courageous and wise, and launch a fierce attack on all ghosts and monsters that are anti-Party and anti-socialism. We should be pioneers of the cultural revolution and defenders of Mao Zedong Thought.

It is through revolutionary struggle and the practical application of Chairman Mao's works that Liu Yingjun grew into a great communist fighter. The most fundamental aspect of learning from Liu Yingjun is to learn from his conscious effort to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, learning in struggle and using in struggle.

Mao Zedong Thought is the truth that guides the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people in their revolutionary struggles. It is a brilliant continuation and development of Marxism-Leninism based on great revolutionary practice. It is developed through long, complex, and intense struggles against domestic and foreign class enemies. The essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is to criticize, to struggle, and to revolutionize. Only by learning and applying in struggle can one truly understand and master Mao Zedong Thought.

The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the greatest and best classroom for us to actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's books are the highest directives for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. By firmly following Chairman Mao's directives, we can maintain the correct political direction in the Cultural Revolution, implement the Party's policies, stand firm in the struggle, distinguish between friends and enemies, thoroughly expose and criticize the bourgeoisie, continuously raise our proletarian consciousness and political thought, and successfully carry out this struggle. We must actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in this struggle, learn with questions in mind, learn in combination with actual practice, learn frequently, and learn repeatedly. Only by arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought can we defeat the enemy. Only by actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle against the enemy can we truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

In the second half of this year, the entire military will continue to vigorously implement the five principles of emphasizing politics. This is a major issue in the struggle between the proletarian military line and the bourgeois military line in military construction. Only by firmly implementing Chairman Mao's military thought and military line, and eliminating the influence of bourgeois military thought, can we ensure that our military advances rapidly on the path of revolutionary construction and fundamentally prepares for the war of resistance against American imperialist aggression.

Implementing the five principles of emphasizing politics is a process of repeated education and struggle. We must actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the process of implementing the five principles of emphasizing politics, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to oppose and overcome tendencies such as pure militarism.

As a young soldier, Liu Yingjun was able to persist in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, adhere to the direction of emphasizing politics, and resolutely struggle against pure militarism. This is extremely precious and particularly worthy of our learning. If every comrade can be like Liu Yingjun, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the implementation of the five principles of emphasizing politics will be guaranteed, which is the best and most fundamental preparedness.

Comrades throughout the military, we must enthusiastically respond to the call of the General Political Department, launch a campaign to learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun, Chairman Mao's good soldier, in the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the implementation of the five principles of emphasizing politics, and in carrying out preparedness and other tasks, study the highest directives, execute the highest directives, propagate the highest directives, and defend the highest directives!

    在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想
    总政治部发出了在全军开展宣传和学习刘英俊同志的活动的通知。
    总政治部指出，刘英俊同志用实际行动响应了把毛主席的书当作最高指示的号召，他是最高指示的模范执行者，是全军同志学习的榜样。
    总政治部的通知中还说：“当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命正在轰轰烈烈地开展。党中央号召我们：一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。中央军委和林彪同志号召我们大抓突出政治五项原则的落实。在全军开展宣传和学习刘英俊同志的活动，对于更好地贯彻执行党中央、军委和林彪同志的这些指示，推动我军干部战士更加积极地参加文化大革命，促进我军的革命化建设和加强战备，都有很大的意义。”
    解放十六年来，在我国，无产阶级和资产阶级在意识形态领域中的阶级斗争，一直是十分激烈的。目前轰轰烈烈开展的无产阶级文化大革命，是这个斗争的继续，它把我国社会主义革命推进到更加深入和广阔的阶段。这个斗争，归根到底，是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺领导权的斗争。我们要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级阴谋变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。这是一场极其尖锐、极其复杂的阶级斗争。
    我军是党和毛主席缔造和领导的工人农民的军队，是无产阶级专政的重要工具。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要同广大工农群众一道，站在斗争的最前列，积极参加斗争，迎头痛击资产阶级在意识形态领域中的一切挑战。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我军的每个同志，都应当成为象刘英俊那样的，用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命战士。我们要象他那样，忠于党，忠于人民，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想。要象他那样，听毛主席的话，听党的话，全心全意为人民，为社会主义和共产主义。要象他那样，活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的书当作最高指示，敢想、敢说，有勇、有谋，向反党反社会主义的一切牛鬼蛇神猛烈开火，做文化革命的闯将，做捍卫毛泽东思想的战斗员。
    在革命斗争的实践中活学活用毛主席著作，这是刘英俊成长为伟大的共产主义战士的根本原因。学习刘英俊，最根本的，是学习他自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，在斗争中学，在斗争中用。
    毛泽东思想，是指导无产阶级和广大劳动人民进行革命斗争的真理，是在伟大的革命实践的基础上天才地继承和发展了的马克思列宁主义，是在同国内外阶级敌人进行长期的、复杂的、激烈的斗争中发展起来的。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的本质，就是要批判，要斗争，要革命。只有在斗争中学，在斗争中用，才能真正领会毛泽东思想，掌握毛泽东思想。
    当前的无产阶级文化大革命，是我们活学活用毛泽东思想的最大最好的课堂。毛主席的书，是无产阶级文化大革命的最高指示。坚决遵循毛主席的指示，我们就能够在文化大革命中坚持正确的政治方向，贯彻执行党的方针政策，就能够在斗争中站稳立场，分清敌我，彻底揭露和批判资产阶级，就能够不断地提高自己的无产阶级觉悟和政治思想水平，胜利地进行这场斗争。我们一定要在这场斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，带着问题学，结合实际学，经常学，反复学。只有用毛泽东思想武装自己，才能战胜敌人。只有在同敌人的斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，才能把毛泽东思想学到手。
    今年下半年，全军要继续大抓突出政治五项原则的落实。这是我军建设中无产阶级军事路线和资产阶级军事路线两条路线斗争的大事。只有坚决贯彻毛主席的建军思想、建军路线，肃清资产阶级军事思想的影响，才能保证我军在革命化建设的道路上飞跃前进，从根本上做好反对美帝国主义侵略战争的准备。
    突出政治五项原则的落实，是一个反复教育、反复斗争的过程。我们必须在突出政治五项原则落实的过程中，活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，反对和克服单纯军事观点等不良倾向。
    刘英俊作为一个年青的战士，能够坚持活学活用毛主席著作，坚持突出政治的方向，坚决同单纯军事观点作斗争，这是十分可贵的，是特别值得我们学习的。如果我们每个同志都能够象刘英俊那样，用毛泽东思想武装起来，突出政治五项原则的落实，就有了可靠的保证，这也就是最好、最根本的战备。
    全军同志们，我们要热烈响应总政治部的号召，掀起向毛主席的好战士刘英俊学习的热潮，在无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中，在突出政治五项原则的落实中，在执行战备和其他各项任务中，学习最高指示，执行最高指示，宣传最高指示，捍卫最高指示！
