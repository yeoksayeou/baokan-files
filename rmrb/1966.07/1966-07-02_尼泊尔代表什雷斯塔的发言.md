	Nepalese representative Siddhi Charan Shrestha said at the general meeting of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers today that in response to the sabotage by imperialism and its agents against anti-imperialist forces, the peoples of Asia and Africa should form a united front to oppose all kinds of enemies of the people.

	He said, the struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America is for a common goal, that is, to achieve the final victory of the people and defeat the enemies of the people—imperialists, colonialists, and neo-colonialists. Only when imperialism is completely eliminated, truth and justice can be realized.

	When talking about the glorious anti-imperialist and anti-colonial tradition of the Nepalese people, he said, Nepal has never yielded to foreign oppression and will never tolerate any foreign interference by imperialists.

	He said, we fully support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against the aggression of American imperialism. We demand that the U.S. armed forces must withdraw from Vietnamese territory, oppose the evil attacks of the Pentagon, and that South and North Vietnam must be reunified. We demand that the U.S. aggressors withdraw from South Vietnam before any negotiations begin. The just cause of the heroic Vietnamese people fighting to the end against American imperialism must be supported in every form.

	He also exposed the cultural aggression of imperialism and colonialism against Asian, African, and Latin American countries.

    尼泊尔代表什雷斯塔的发言
    新华社一日讯　尼泊尔代表西迪·查兰·什雷斯塔今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，针对帝国主义及其代理人对反帝力量的破坏，亚非人民应该形成一个统一战线，来反对形形色色的人民的敌人。
    他说，亚非拉人民的斗争是为了一个共同的目标，那就是争取人民的最后胜利和打败人民的敌人——帝国主义者、殖民主义者和新殖民主义者。只有帝国主义者最后被彻底消灭，真理和正义才能实现。
    在谈到尼泊尔人民反帝反殖的光荣传统时，他说，尼泊尔从来没有屈从于外国的镇压，并且也决不会容忍帝国主义者的任何外来干涉。
    他说，我们完全支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争。我们要求美国武装力量必须从越南的土地上撤走，反对美国五角大楼的罪恶攻击，越南南北必须重新统一起来。我们要求美国侵略者在任何谈判开始以前就从南越撤走。对于英雄的越南人民同美帝国主义者斗争到底的正义事业，必须给予他们以一切形式的支持。
    他还揭露帝国主义、殖民主义对亚非拉国家的文化侵略。
