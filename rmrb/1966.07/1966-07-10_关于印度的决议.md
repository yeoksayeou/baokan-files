The Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, held in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, from June 27 to July 9, 1966, with over 160 anti-imperialist writers from 53 countries and regions and 5 international organizations, after studying the serious political and economic situation in India, resolves as follows:

1.	Firmly support the increasingly powerful and brave struggle of the 450 million Indian people against the Indian National Congress government. This government, in its 18 years of corrupt rule, has consistently pursued the most reactionary policies, enriching the big monopolists, landlords, and foreign capitalists, while bringing disaster to the Indian people, with millions facing famine and miserable conditions.

2.	The big bourgeoisie and landlord government of India not only pledges India's economy, independence, and sovereignty to imperialism but also betrays the historically significant principles of Asian-African solidarity against imperialism and old and new colonialism adopted at the 1955 Bandung Conference. This government is actually closely allied with the most reactionary regimes in Asia, such as the Japanese militarists, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the neocolonialists of "Malaysia," and the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia, serving the global strategy of U.S. imperialism to rule the world.

3.	The government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has gone even further in selling out the national interests of the Indian people. Under the tattered and deceitful cloak of non-alignment, it colludes with the traitorous Dange group of the national working class and socialists, shamelessly becoming a faithful servant and henchman of U.S. imperialism. It suppresses and rules over the Asian and African peoples, executing the U.S. plan to invade the People's Republic of China—the bastion of the world revolutionary movement and a staunch defender of peace.

4.	The conference strongly condemns the treacherous role of the Indian National Congress government. As the chairman of the International Control Commission for India, it has not only failed to fulfill its duty to oppose U.S. aggression but has also shamelessly colluded with U.S. aggression. Together with Canada, it signed the so-called report on the "infiltration" of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam into the South.

5.	The Indian reactionary government has shamelessly peddled Johnson's "unconditional talks" fraud to help its imperialist masters.

6.	The conference strongly condemns the despicable role of the Indian government in the U.S. policy of "containing" China.

7.	The conference strongly condemns the Indian government's submission to U.S. imperialism in establishing the "Indo-American Foundation" to infiltrate Indian social and cultural life, corrupting and degrading the moral standards of the Indian people.

8.	The conference condemns the infamous Tashkent Conference, whose purpose was to use the deceptive smokescreen of "peacefully" resolving the dispute between India and Pakistan to make Pakistan join India in a "defense" against China.

    关于印度的决议
    自一九六六年六月二十七日至七月九日在中华人民共和国首都北京召开的，有来自五十三个国家和地区及五个国际组织的一百六十多名反帝作家参加的亚非作家紧急会议，在研究了印度的严重的政治和经济局势之后，决议如下：
    1、坚决支持四亿五千万印度人民反对印度国大党政府的日益强大的英勇斗争。这个政府在它十八年的腐败统治中，一直执行着最反动的政策，使大垄断资本家、地主和外国资本家发财，而使印度人民群众遭受灾难，其中成百万人正面临着饥荒和悲惨处境。
    2、印度的大资产阶级大地主政府不仅把印度的经济、独立和主权押给了帝国主义，而且背叛了一九五五年万隆会议通过的亚非团结反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的具有历史意义的原则。这个政府事实上同亚洲最反动的政权，例如日本军国主义者、蒋介石匪帮、“马来西亚”新殖民主义者和印度尼西亚的右翼反动势力密切联合，为美帝国主义统治世界的全球战略效劳。
    3、英迪拉·甘地总理的政府在出卖印度人民的民族利益的路上已走得更远。它披着破烂不堪的骗人的不结盟外衣，同全国工人阶级和社会主义的叛徒丹吉集团勾结，恬不知耻地成为美帝国主义的忠实奴仆和爪牙，以镇压和统治亚非人民、执行美国侵略中华人民共和国——世界革命运动的堡垒和和平的坚强捍卫者——的计划。
    4、会议强烈谴责国大党政府所起的奸诈作用。它代表印度作为印度支那国际监督委员会的主席，不仅没有履行其反对美国侵略的职责，而且无耻地同美国的侵略勾结，同加拿大一起在所谓“越南民主共和国对南方的渗透”的报告上签字。
    5、印度反动政府一直无耻地兜售约翰逊的“无条件谈判”骗局，以便帮助其帝国主义主子。
    6、会议强烈谴责印度政府在美国的“遏制”中国的政策中所起的卑鄙作用。
    7、会议强烈谴责印度政府屈从美帝国主义，设立“印美基金会”，以便渗入印度的社会和文化生活，腐蚀和败坏印度人民的道德。
    8、会议谴责臭名昭彰的塔什干会议，那次会议的目的，是要在“和平”解决印度和巴基斯坦纠纷的骗人烟幕之下，使巴基斯坦同印度一起，联合“防御”中国。
