The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (AJMPU) placed political education at the center of all education, using Chairman Mao's works as the core textbooks. They seriously studied Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, making political work the foundation of all work.

In April 1939, Chairman Mao wrote an important inscription for the AJMPU: "The dividing line between intellectuals becoming revolutionary or non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary lies in whether they are willing to and actually join the workers and peasants. The dividing line is just this point." In July of the same year, the Central Military Commission issued a special directive on the reorganization of the AJMPU, stating: All work in the school is aimed at transforming the students' thoughts. Political education is the central link; the number of courses should not be too many, and class education and party education must be greatly strengthened. The AJMPU is not a school of the united front but a cadre school led by the Party. It also pointed out: We must educate young intellectuals to master Marxism-Leninism, have discipline and organization, be determined to go to the grassroots to do practical work, and be determined to serve the workers and peasants. The AJMPU followed the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Central Military Commission, focusing on political and ideological education, strengthening the ideological transformation of young intellectuals, and rapidly cultivating them into revolutionary cadres.

	Chairman Mao's works are the guiding direction for all our work. Chairman Mao's works are the core textbooks of the AJMPU. This is what the students of the AJMPU were reading at that time: Chairman Mao's works such as "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War."

	In 1939, Chairman Mao inscribed for the AJMPU's production movement: "Now study on one hand, produce on the other; in the future, fight on one hand, produce on the other. This is the style of the AJMPU, sufficient to defeat any enemy."

	Following Chairman Mao's instruction to "not only be able to fight, do mass work, but also produce," the faculty and students of the AJMPU actively participated in the vigorous production movement. They planted grains and vegetables, raised pigs, sheep, chickens, and rabbits, spun yarn, and knitted sweaters. They also established specialized institutions to produce oil, transport salt, and mine coal. Thus, they solved the problems of insufficient school funds and materials, improving their lives.

	The picture shows the faculty and students of the AJMPU spinning yarn.

	Chairman Mao said: "Reading is learning, using is also learning, and it is more important learning." He also said: "If you have the correct theory but only talk about it and do not put it into practice, then no matter how good the theory is, it is meaningless." The teaching principle of the AJMPU is to combine theory with practice, focusing on a few but essential points, and keeping it short and concise.

	The picture shows students studying theory while engaging in practical operations.

	The cultural activities of the AJMPU were closely integrated with ideological education and military training, playing an important role in promoting the all-around development of students' moral, intellectual, and physical education.

	The picture shows students of the AJMPU singing anti-Japanese songs.

	The faculty and students of the AJMPU personally dug caves, repaired classrooms, and made teaching aids, solving the problems of insufficient funds, classrooms, and teaching materials.

	The picture shows female students installing doors and windows for caves.

	Self-reliance and thrift in running the school: The faculty and students of the AJMPU worked together to open up wasteland and farm, overcoming material difficulties, strengthening the labor perspective, and cultivating a revolutionary style of hard work and plain living. In 1939, the AJMPU launched a production movement. Chairman Mao inscribed for the AJMPU: "Study on one hand, produce on the other, overcome difficulties, and the enemy will be disheartened." That year alone, the entire school reclaimed over 17,000 mu of land.

    继承和发扬抗大光荣传统
    以毛主席著作为基本教材把政治思想教育摆在首位
    抗大把政治教育作为一切教育的中心，以毛主席著作为基本教材，认真学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，把政治工作作为全盘工作的基础。
    一九三九年四月，毛主席为抗大作了重要题词：“知识分子之成为革命的，或不革命的，或反革命的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行结合工农民众，他们的分界仅仅在这一点。”同年七月，中央军委专门发出《关于整理抗大问题的指示》，指出：学校一切工作都是转变学生的思想。政治教育是中心一环，课目不宜太多，阶级教育、党的教育工作必须大大加强。抗大不是统一战线学校，而是党领导下的干部学校。还指出：要教育知识青年掌握马克思列宁主义，有纪律性、组织性，决心深入下层作实际工作，决心为工农民众服务。抗大遵照毛主席和中央军委的指示，狠抓政治思想教育，加强了对知识青年的思想改造工作，使他们迅速成长为革命干部。

   以毛主席著作为基本教材　毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代，天才地、创造性地、全面地继承和发展了的马克思列宁主义。毛主席的书是我们各项工作的指导方向。毛主席的著作是抗大的基本教材。
    这是抗大学员当时阅读的毛主席的《中国革命与中国共产党》、《中国革命战争的战略问题》等著作。
    一九三九年毛主席为抗大开展生产运动的题词：“现在一面学习，一面生产，将来一面作战，一面生产，这就是抗大的作风，足以战胜任何敌人的”。
    一面学习一面生产抗大的教职人员和学员遵照毛主席“不但会打仗、会做群众工作，又会生产”的指示，积极投入轰轰烈烈的大生产运动。他们种植粮食蔬菜，喂养猪羊鸡兔，捻毛线，织毛衣。并成立专门机构，进行榨油、运盐、挖煤等生产。从而解决学校经费不足、物资不足的困难，改善了生活。
    图为抗大的师生在纺线。
    毛主席说：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”又说：“如果有了正确的理论，只是把它空谈一阵，束之高阁，并不实行，那末，这种理论再好也是没有意义的。”抗大的教学原则是理论与实际相联系，少而精，短而少。
    图为学员们一面学习理论，一面进行实际操作。
    抗大的文化活动与思想教育、军事训练紧密结合，对促进学员的德育、智育、体育的全面发展起了重要的作用。
    图为抗大学员在高唱抗日歌曲。
    抗大师生自己动手挖窑洞、修课堂、制教具，解决了经费不足、校舍不足、教材不足等困难。
    图为女学员在安窑洞门窗。
    自力更生，勤俭办校　抗大教职员和学员们一齐动手开荒种地，既克服了物质困难，又增强了劳动观点，养成了艰苦朴素的革命作风。一九三九年，抗大开展了生产运动。毛主席为抗大题词：“一面学习，一面生产，克服困难，敌人丧胆。”仅这一年，全校就开荒一万七千余亩。
