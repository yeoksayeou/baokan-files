In the midst of the U.S. imperialists' frenzied expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam and their plot to "bomb to force negotiations," British Prime Minister Wilson has actively colluded and run errands, playing a most unseemly role.

As soon as the American bandit planes bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, Wilson issued a statement in the British House of Commons. After hypocritically expressing some "regret," he immediately declared that Britain "remains convinced" that the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam is "correct." He then shamelessly claimed that the responsibility for continuing the fighting "lies with Hanoi," openly threatening the Vietnamese people to accept the U.S. imperialists' "unconditional negotiations." It is clear that on the Vietnam issue, Wilson has always been Johnson's obedient servant.

The Labour Party government's eagerness to serve U.S. imperialism is not limited to issuing a few statements. As soon as the sound of the bombs dropped by American bandits in Hanoi was heard, on July 16, Wilson personally rushed to Moscow to conduct three days of "most intimate" and "unusual detailed" secret talks with Kosygin on the Vietnam issue. Under the guise of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, they were engaged in unscrupulous dealings.

The collusion between the British Labour Party government and the Soviet leaders on the Vietnam issue has a long history. For a long time, the two sides have been in cahoots, responding to each other, actively working for the U.S. policy of aggression against Vietnam. Today, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, in collusion with the Johnson government, is concocting the "bomb to force negotiations" fraud, attempting to gather all kinds of ghosts and snakes to take "joint action." Wilson's visit to the Soviet Union, like Indira Gandhi's visit to the Soviet Union, is part of the grand conspiracy centered in Moscow to betray the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The Labour Party government, on the one hand, vigorously peddles the Johnson government's "negotiation" fraud, and on the other hand, viciously attacks China, which firmly supports the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. On July 7, Wilson brazenly attacked Premier Zhou Enlai's principled stance on the Vietnam issue in the British House of Commons. On July 13, he openly called for British public demonstrations at the Chinese Embassy in London. Wilson, as a head of government, has shamelessly slandered China's leaders and incited anti-China activities. Such despicable behavior is rare in international relations. Wilson's posture as an anti-China vanguard can only further expose his ugly face as a henchman of U.S. imperialism.

In fact, the Labour Party government's role as a henchman of U.S. imperialism is not limited to peddling "negotiation" goods and conducting anti-China activities. British military and police officials have long been stationed in Saigon. Since last year, the British Air Force has been helping the U.S. aggressors transport military supplies in South Vietnam. This year, the Labour Party government has sent medical teams to South Vietnam. It is noteworthy that a batch of British troops is building an air base in Thailand. What is particularly infuriating is that the Labour Party government has also provided Hong Kong to the United States as a base for its aggression against Vietnam. All this shows that the Labour Party government is gradually dragging Britain into the vortex of the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression against Vietnam.

Now, the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression against Vietnam has escalated to a new and more serious stage. The U.S. imperialists have no limits in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, and China's support for Vietnam's struggle against U.S. aggression has no limits. At this critical moment, we must warn British Prime Minister Wilson: You have tied Britain's fate to that of U.S. imperialism, which can only accelerate the collapse of British imperialism and have no other outcome!

    威尔逊的丑恶嘴脸
    本报评论员
    在美帝国主义疯狂扩大侵越战争、大搞“以炸迫和”的阴谋中，英国首相威尔逊积极策应，奔走效劳，扮演了一个极不光采的角色。
    美国强盗飞机一轰炸河内、海防，威尔逊就在英国下院发表了一项声明。他在假惺惺地表示了一番“遗憾”之后，马上宣称英国“仍然确信”美国侵越政策“是对的”，并且胡说什么“使战斗继续下去的责任”“在于河内”，公然威胁越南人民接受美帝国主义的“无条件谈判”。很清楚，在越南问题上，威尔逊从来就是约翰逊的驯服的仆从。
    工党政府为美帝国主义效劳的积极性，绝不仅仅局限于发表个把声明。美国强盗扔在河内的炸弹声一响，七月十六日，威尔逊就亲自赶到莫斯科，同柯西金就越南问题进行了三天“最亲密的”和“不寻常的详细”的密谈，在日内瓦会议两主席的外衣下，干着不可告人的勾当。
    英国工党政府同苏联领导人在越南问题上的勾结，由来已久。长期以来，双方就一搭一档，你呼我应，为美国的侵越政策出力奔走。今天，苏联修正主义领导集团同约翰逊政府串通一气搞“以炸迫和”的骗局，力图把各种牛鬼蛇神纠集在一起采取“联合行动”。威尔逊访苏，同印度总理甘地夫人访苏一样，都是这个以莫斯科为中心的出卖越南人民抗美救国斗争的大阴谋的组成部分。
    英国工党政府一方面卖力地推销约翰逊政府的“和谈”骗局，一方面恶毒攻击坚决支援越南人民抗美救国斗争的中国。七月七日，威尔逊在英国下院放肆地指名攻击我国周恩来总理对于越南问题的严正立场。十三日，他又公然叫嚷要英国公众到我国驻英代办处去示威。威尔逊以一个政府首脑的身份，竟然如此明目张胆地诬蔑中国的领导人和煽动反华活动，这种卑劣行径，在国际关系中是罕见的。威尔逊摆出这样一副反华急先锋的姿态，只能进一步暴露自己充当美帝国主义帮凶的丑恶嘴脸。
    事实上，工党政府充当美帝国主义的帮凶，绝不止于兜售“和谈”黑货和进行反华活动。英国军警官员长期驻在西贡活动。从去年以来，英国空军就在南越帮助美国侵略者运送军用物资。今年，工党政府又派遣医疗队前往南越。值得注意的是，有一批英国军队正在泰国修建空军基地。尤其令人愤慨的是工党政府还把香港提供给美国作为进行侵越战争的活动基地。这一切表明，工党政府正在一步一步地使英国卷进美帝国主义侵越战争的漩涡。
    现在，美帝国主义侵略越南的战争，已经上升到一个新的更严重的阶段，美帝国主义扩大侵越战争没有界限，中国的援越抗美也没有界限。在这个严重的时刻，我们要正告英国首相威尔逊：你把英国的命运同美帝国主义拴在一起，只能加速英帝国主义的崩溃，不可能有别的下场！
