Chairman Mao's Concern in Our Hearts
—Selected Poems from the Earthquake-Stricken Areas of Xingtai

Chairman Mao Cares for Us Everywhere
Community Member, Wang Qiaohua
On March 8th, we were struck by an earthquake. The news reached Tiananmen Gate, and Chairman Mao especially cared for us, sending the Central Condolence Team. Day and night, they rushed to the disaster area, bringing the concern and support of the people from all over the country. First, they asked if the community members were safe, then they asked about our lives and production. The people of the disaster area are spirited, rebuilding our homes through self-reliance. We will never forget the Party's kindness; Chairman Mao's concern is in our hearts!

Chairman Mao's Works Are Like a Beacon
Community Member, Guo Linsen
The waters of the Honghe River are deep, and the Party and the people are united in heart. We are not afraid of the earthquake disaster; Chairman Mao has sent us trusted comrades. The waters of the Honghe River are clear, and Chairman Mao's works are like a beacon. The People's Liberation Army has brought us priceless treasures, guiding us to light in the face of difficulties. The waters of the Honghe River are long, and Chairman Mao's thoughts shine with golden light. If we lose something at home, we find it in the fields. Rebuilding our homes, we do not forget the Party.

Chairman Mao's Good Soldiers

Class brothers suffer the earthquake, the People's Liberation Army hastens through the night, full of enthusiasm to the disaster area, bringing strength and light to the community members. With Chairman Mao's words, you have inspired the disaster-stricken class brothers. You have done countless good deeds, yet you do not wish to leave your names. You are truly Chairman Mao's good soldiers. We will write countless poems to sing your praises.

The People of the Disaster Area Have Firm Wills

The people of the disaster area have firm wills, with Chairman Mao's thoughts leading the way. With red hearts and brave spirits, the direction is clear, overcoming the earthquake and all difficulties. The people of the disaster area have firm wills, heroes who fight against the heavens and the earth. With great efforts, we will engage in production and definitely produce grain and cotton for the land!

Class Feelings Deeper Than the Sea
Community Member, Meng Shucai
The Xingtai region suffered an earthquake, and the people of Tibet are concerned. They sent horses over ten thousand miles without fear of hardship, with class feelings deeper than the sea.
