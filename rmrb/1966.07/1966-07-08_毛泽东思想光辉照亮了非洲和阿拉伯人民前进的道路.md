In Africa and the Arab countries, we have encountered numerous Africans and Arabs who love Chairman Mao. They praise Chairman Mao as the great leader of all progressive peoples in the world, comparing Mao Zedong Thought to the torch of world revolution, and viewing China, led by Mao Zedong, as the hope of all peoples in the world. They yearn to visit the holy land of world revolution—China—to see Chairman Mao. They eagerly seek a copy of Chairman Mao's works in translation, even a Mao Zedong badge, a portrait of Chairman Mao, or a photograph of Chairman Mao.

Revolutionary People Love Mao Zedong Thought

A friend from Mozambique said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the torch of world revolution. Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of all progressive and oppressed peoples in the world."

A revolutionary from Congo (Leopoldville) said: "Chairman Mao is a giant of contemporary humanity. Mao Zedong Thought serves all the peoples of the world. He is the successor of Marxism-Leninism and, based on contemporary conditions and foresight for the future, has developed and enriched the theories of Marxism-Leninism. With Mao Zedong Thought, one can avoid failure and confidently march towards victory."

A friend from South Africa said that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for all oppressed peoples and points the way for them to build a new society after gaining independence, passing the revolution from generation to generation. Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth.

A friend from Palestine said that Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary, and his books are very approachable. Because his brilliant and guiding books are a summary of the Chinese revolution's experience.

A young man from East Africa said: "China, led by Mao Zedong, raises the banner of revolution, opposes modern revisionism, and has become the most revolutionary country. Modern revisionism has joined hands with the United States, and the hopes of the world rest on China."

A freedom fighter from Bechuanaland said: "Reading Chairman Mao's works makes one's spirit soar, as if one has been reborn. Like a true revolutionary, one is reborn."

Mao Zedong Thought is the truth of revolution. It transcends all borders and obstacles, and all revolutionary peoples welcome and love it.

Mao Zedong's Works Are Praised Everywhere

In the jungles of Congo (Leopoldville), the warriors of the patriotic armed forces eagerly read various local language translations of Mao Zedong's works during lulls in battle. The warriors draw strength from these works and arm their minds.

In the western end of the Sahara Desert in Mauritania, a friend took out a copy of Chairman Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" in French from his home. The book was quite worn, obviously having been read many times. He said: "Here, a few books by Mao Zedong are hard to come by!"

Freedom fighters from various countries in Southern Africa have carefully read "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" from cover to cover. They discuss each of Mao Zedong's works.

In the Arab world, Syria systematically published Chairman Mao's works. In Beirut, various language versions and editions of Chairman Mao's small pamphlets are circulating, and recently an Arabic version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has been published. In Cairo, "On New Democracy," "On Contradiction," and other works have long been translated into Arabic and published. In Jordan, although Chairman Mao's works are banned, they are still being secretly circulated.

A leader of a nationalist party in South Africa told us that in South Africa under white colonial rule, Mao Zedong's works are banned. He said: "Imperialism tries to build a wall to block Mao Zedong Thought. But they have failed. Mao Zedong Thought blooms like a flower, spreading its fragrance everywhere."

In many capitals of African and Arab countries, China has held economic exhibitions and book exhibitions. At all these exhibitions, the display of Chairman Mao's works is always the most crowded place. Some people are engrossed in flipping through Chairman Mao's books. Some stand in front of the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, gazing at the great leader's face, and some are praying for Chairman Mao's health. Chinese song and dance troupes and acrobatic troupes have performed in many African and Arab countries, and millions of audiences cheer for them. Although the audience does not understand Chinese, they understand the name "Mao Zedong." Whether it is singing "The East Is Red," "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," or any other song, as soon as they hear the name "Mao Zedong," there is thunderous applause or cheers of "Long live Mao Zedong!"

Chairman Mao's Words Are All Truth

Chairman Mao's words are all truth. This is the conclusion drawn by the peoples of Africa and Arabia from the experiences of the struggles of China, Vietnam, and other peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as from their personal experiences.

"U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of all peoples of the world." They believe that Chairman Mao's words are absolutely true. A warrior from Congo (Leopoldville) said, isn't it U.S. imperialism and its accomplices who killed Lumumba? Isn't it U.S. imperialism that launched a military invasion of Congo (Leopoldville), turning Congo (Leopoldville) into an American colony? Freedom fighters from Southern Africa and Portuguese colonies say, without U.S. imperialism, wouldn't Smith, Vorster, and Salazar have been finished long ago? Palestinian patriots say, wasn't it U.S. imperialism that created Israel? Isn't it U.S. imperialism that arms Israel with large quantities of weapons, preventing the Palestinian people from returning to their homeland?

"Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." Chairman Mao's words give great courage to the warriors of Africa and Arabia fighting for liberation. A revolutionary leader from Congo (Leopoldville) said, the reality in Congo (Leopoldville) proves this. Inspired by Mao Zedong Thought, the Congolese warriors began their struggle with bows and spears against the heavily armed U.S. imperialism and its accomplices.

"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." They find this statement particularly easy to understand. Not only in Congo (Leopoldville), Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, where armed struggles have already been launched, people are applying Mao Zedong's theory of people's war, but also in places where armed struggles have not yet been launched, more and more people are accepting this truth. A friend said: "This idea is very easy for us oppressed peoples to understand. Since the U.S. imperialists are armed to the teeth, the oppressed peoples can only pick up weapons to achieve true liberation."

"Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." A freedom fighter said, "Chairman Mao's words are very important to us. In the current situation in Southern Africa, who should we unite with, and who should we oppose? We must draw a clear line between enemies and friends and establish our own front."

Many freedom fighters can recite Mao Zedong's sixteen-character formula for guerrilla warfare: "The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue."

When more and more revolutionary peoples of Africa and Arabia grasp Mao Zedong Thought, what kind of situation will emerge? Imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries fear this day. But this day will surely come.

### 毛泽东思想光辉照亮了非洲和阿拉伯人民前进的道路

    毛泽东思想光辉照亮了非洲和阿拉伯人民前进的道路
    在非洲和阿拉伯国家，我们遇到过许许多多热爱毛主席的非洲人和阿拉伯人。他们称颂毛主席是全世界一切进步人民的伟大领袖，把毛泽东思想比作是世界革命的火炬，把毛主席领导的中国看成是全世界人民的希望。他们向往着能到世界革命的圣地——中国，见一见毛主席，他们渴望得到一册毛主席著作的译本，甚至一枚毛主席纪念章，一幅毛主席画象，一张毛主席照片。
    革命人民热爱毛泽东思想
    莫三鼻给的一位朋友说：“毛泽东思想是世界革命的火炬。毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是全世界一切进步人民和被压迫人民的伟大领袖。”
    刚果（利）一位革命者说：“毛主席是当代人类的巨人。毛泽东思想是为全世界人民服务的。他是当代马克思列宁主义的继承者，并且根据当代的情况和对未来的预见，发展和丰富了马克思列宁主义的理论。有了毛泽东思想，就可以避免失败，就可以满怀信心地走向胜利。”
    一位南非朋友说，毛泽东思想是一切被压迫人民的指路明灯，而且为他们在取得独立后建立新的社会指出道路，使革命一代一代地传下去。毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理。
    一位巴勒斯坦朋友说，毛主席是最伟大的革命家，他的书读起来很亲切。因为他那光辉的具有指导意义的书，是中国革命经验的总结。
    一个来自东非的青年说：“毛泽东领导的中国，高举革命红旗，反对现代修正主义，成为最革命的国家。现代修正主义已经和美国走在一起，全世界的希望都落到中国身上。”
    一位贝专纳的自由战士说：“读了毛主席的著作，使人精神焕发，犹如获得新生。象真正的革命者那样新生。”
    毛泽东思想是革命的真理，它超越一切疆界和障碍，一切革命的人民都欢迎它，热爱它。
    毛泽东著作到处传颂
    在刚果（利）的丛林里，爱国武装力量的战士们在战斗的间隙，热切地读着毛泽东著作的各种地方语译本。战士们从这些著作里吸取力量，武装自己的思想。
    在撒哈拉大沙漠的西端的毛里塔尼亚，一位朋友从他的家里取出一本毛主席著的《〈共产党人〉发刊词》的法文译本。书已经被翻得很陈旧了，显然书的主人已经不知翻阅过多少遍了。他说：“在这里，几本毛泽东著作，得来可不容易啊！”
    南部非洲各国在国外的自由战士们，许多人从头到尾仔细阅读《毛泽东选集》。他们讨论着一篇篇毛泽东著作。
    在阿拉伯世界，叙利亚系统地出版了毛主席的著作。在贝鲁特，各种语文、各种版本的毛主席著作的小册子在流传，最近还出版了阿拉伯文版的《毛泽东选集》。在开罗，很早以前已经有人把《新民主主义论》、《矛盾论》等著作译成阿拉伯文出版。在约旦，毛主席的著作虽然被禁止，却仍然在秘密地传阅着。
    南非一位民族主义政党领导人告诉我们，在白人殖民者统治的南非，毛泽东著作被列为禁书。他说：“帝国主义企图筑一道墙，堵住毛泽东思想。可是他们失败了。毛泽东思想象盛开的花朵，到处发散着它的芳香。”
    在许多非洲和阿拉伯国家的首都，曾经举办过中国经济展览会、中国书籍展览会。在所有这些展览会上，陈列毛主席著作的地方，总是最拥挤的地方。有人在聚精会神地翻阅毛主席的书。有人站在毛主席巨象面前凝视伟大领袖的面容，有人在为毛主席的健康祝福。中国的歌舞团、杂技团到过许多非洲和阿拉伯国家演出，千千万万的观众为他们演出喝采。尽管观众不懂中国话，可是他们都听得懂“毛泽东”这个名字。不管是唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》，还是别的什么歌子，只要一听到“毛泽东”的名字，立刻就是雷鸣般的掌声，或者是“毛泽东万岁”的欢呼声。
    毛主席的话句句是真理
    毛主席的话句句是真理。这是非洲和阿拉伯人民从中国、越南和其他亚非拉人民斗争的经验中，也是从他们亲身的经验中得出的结论。
    “美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人”。他们认为毛主席的这句话千真万确。刚果（利）的战士说，不正是美帝国主义及其帮凶杀害了卢蒙巴？不正是美帝国主义对刚果（利）进行武装侵略、把刚果（利）变成美国的殖民地？南部非洲、葡属殖民地的自由战士们说，没有美帝国主义，什么史密斯、维沃尔德、萨拉查，不早就完蛋了吗？巴勒斯坦爱国者说，不正是美帝国主义制造了以色列？不正是美帝国主义用大量军火武装以色列，使得巴勒斯坦人民不能重返家园？
    “帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”。毛主席这句话给了争取解放的非洲和阿拉伯的战士们极大的勇气。一位刚果（利）革命领导人说，刚果（利）的现实证明了这一点。受到毛主席思想鼓舞的刚果战士们，在武装到牙齿的美帝国主义及其帮凶面前，用弓箭和长矛开始了他们的斗争。
    “枪杆子里面出政权”。他们对这句话感到特别容易理解。不但在刚果（利）、莫三鼻给、津巴布韦已经开展了武装斗争的地方，人们在运用毛主席关于人民战争的理论，在那些还没有开展武装斗争的地方，也有越来越多的人接受这个真理。一位朋友说：“这一思想是我们被压迫的人民很容易理解的。既然美帝国主义者武装到牙齿，被压迫的人民只有拿起武器才能获得真正的解放。”
    “谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”一位自由战士说，“毛主席这些话对我们非常重要。在南部非洲当前形势下究竟应当团结谁，反对谁？应当划清敌我，建立自己的阵线。”
    毛主席关于游击战争的十六字诀：“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”很多自由战士都能脱口而出。
    当越来越多的非洲和阿拉伯革命人民掌握毛泽东思想的时候，该会出现怎样的形势呢？帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派害怕这一天的到来。但是这一天一定会到来的。
