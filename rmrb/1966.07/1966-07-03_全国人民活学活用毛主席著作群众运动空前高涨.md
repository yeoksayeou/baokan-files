A great initiative of epoch-making significance for the future of the revolution in China and the world

The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is surging to unprecedented heights throughout the country. Learning from the People's Liberation Army to emphasize politics and Mao Zedong Thought, everyone reads Chairman Mao's books, listens to Chairman Mao's words, and acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Mao Zedong Thought is spreading among the 700 million people, and over the years, it has achieved brilliant victories in the three great revolutionary movements and in the current Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: Our correspondent reports: A great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is sweeping across our country with unprecedented grandeur and scale.

"Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions!"—this has become the common action slogan of the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and people in our country.

The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the Chinese people, the widespread dissemination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought among the 700 million people, is a great initiative of tremendous historical significance. It is the fundamental guarantee for the complete victory of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country; it is a long-term plan for preventing the emergence of revisionism and preventing the restoration of capitalism for a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand years; it is also a great event of epoch-making significance for the future of the revolution in our country and the world.

In the past few years, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our country has two very distinct characteristics: one is that the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals have shown a high degree of revolutionary self-awareness in their urgent desire to master Mao Zedong Thought. They study Chairman Mao's works with the strongest class feelings and the most tenacious revolutionary will, showing unlimited love, faith, and reverence for Mao Zedong Thought; the other is that in various departments and among many leading cadres on various fronts and in various places, more and more people have come to realize the great significance of emphasizing politics and Mao Zedong Thought. They realize that whether or not to emphasize Mao Zedong Thought is a matter of paramount importance to the fate of our entire country and the world. Therefore, they take the lead in studying and strengthening the leadership of the mass study movement, placing the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work.

At present, on all fronts in our country, from cities to rural areas, from coastal defenses to border regions, advanced figures like Wang Jinxi, the "Iron Man" of Daqing, Chen Yonggui of Dazhai, and Liao Chujiang, Feng Fusheng, and Huang Zushi of the People's Liberation Army, who study and apply Chairman Mao's works with strong class feelings, are emerging in batches. The great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the country is presenting a scene of waves following waves, each wave surging forward, which is inspiring. The broad masses of workers and peasants have mastered Mao Zedong Thought and have become a great material force. In various places across the country, more and more workers and peasants are establishing a worldview of dedicating themselves to the revolution, doing everything for the revolution, and serving the people wholeheartedly. They have mastered the law of the unity of opposites and the dialectical materialist theory of knowledge, and have achieved one brilliant victory after another in the three great revolutionary movements.

Cai Ziquan, an expert in electric light sources from Shanghai, started working in a factory at the age of fourteen and has been blowing glass for more than a decade. The glass factory at Fudan University, where he works, frequently needs hydrogen lamps and xenon lamps, which our country cannot produce. Imperialists and revisionists take this opportunity to strangle us. Cai Ziquan repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Three Articles," thinking: "The enemy's bullying of our country is bullying the Chinese working class! We must boost our own morale and crush the enemy's arrogance, create for the revolution and the people, and fight with them!" Over the past four years, he and his colleagues in the laboratory, following Chairman Mao's "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and the teachings of "Learning War from War," have learned while working. With the strong support of the party committee and relevant units, they have successively developed more than ten new types of electric light sources, filling a gap in our country's electric light source industry.

Xie Yue, a young fine-spinning worker at the Taiyuan Textile Mill, has followed Chairman Mao's teachings over the years, exploring and mastering the laws of splicing, insisting on using "one divides into two," learning from others' strengths and compensating for one's own weaknesses, not being arrogant in victory and not discouraged in defeat, practicing and advancing continuously. Now she can oversee 1,600 spinning spindles and is known as someone who "rides on the horse of objective laws."

Met Aotao, a fifty-something illiterate poor peasant from Hongjin Brigade, Hongqing Commune, Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, began studying Chairman Mao's works during the socialist education movement last year and has persisted in studying every day. She has firmly remembered "three people and a broom" in her heart, understanding the great principles of how to make a revolution and how to be a person. The three people she remembers are Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the old fool who moved mountains, and the broom is criticism and self-criticism. She says, "We must study the spirit of Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the old fool who moved mountains every day and serve the people for life; we must pick up the broom of criticism and self-criticism every day to sweep away the dirt in our minds." She studies with increasing enthusiasm, not only being able to recite many aphorisms from the "Three Articles" and "Against Liberalism" word for word, but also using these words to examine her actions every day. Now, this fifty-something ordinary peasant woman has become a good community member with great revolutionary aspirations, determined to be a pillar of socialist agriculture in the countryside.

The border defense team of Chagula in the Tibet Military Region, guarding the ice peaks and snow-capped mountains of the Himalayas, has set up camp at an altitude of over 5,000 meters with Chairman Mao's works. Although there is no water, no grass, only ice and snow, and weathered stones, the soldiers' atmosphere of studying Chairman Mao's works is very thick. They say: "Chagula indeed lacks everything. There is no water, no grass, only ice and snow and weathered stones. But we have the strongest ideological weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, so we are not afraid of anything." With the spirit of moving mountains, they carry stones up the mountain to build houses and chop mountains to find water sources, finally taking root on the high mountains. On the high mountains with thin air, the soldiers study Chairman Mao's works every day. When there are not enough books, they squeeze out every spare moment to copy them by hand, copying more than a hundred articles by Chairman Mao in a week. The soldiers say: "If we don't read Chairman Mao's books for a day, it's like there's no sun in the snow mountains. Reading Chairman Mao's books every day, the red sun hangs in our hearts."

Such moving examples are countless! The broad masses of workers, peasants, and people in our country have a high degree of revolutionary self-awareness in their urgent desire to master Mao Zedong Thought, which is an irresistible historical trend that no one can stop. A handful of bourgeois "authorities" waving the three big sticks of "vulgarization," "simplification," and "pragmatism" attempt to block this historical trend and sabotage the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the country. Isn't this like a mantis blocking a chariot or an ant shaking a tree, dreaming in broad daylight!

Many leading departments and revolutionary cadres consciously take the lead in studying and strengthening the leadership of the mass study movement, which is an important factor in the sustained development of the great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the broad masses of workers and peasants. In recent years, under the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to "learn from the People's Liberation Army," various places across the country have first seriously studied the great initiative of the People's Liberation Army to emphasize politics and Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, promote everything, and transform everything. They have vigorously promoted the successful experience of the People's Liberation Army in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and have launched a mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works, achieving significant results. In various provinces (municipalities) and autonomous regions, from grassroots units to leading organs, many cadres like Jiao Ruyu who study and apply Chairman Mao's works have emerged. In the socialist education movements in rural and urban areas in recent years, the large number of work team cadres sent by the central and local authorities, especially the cadres of the People's Liberation Army participating in the socialist education movement, have taken the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the movement, infusing Mao Zedong Thought into the workers and peasants, and have had a good effect and far-reaching influence on changing the spiritual face of the working people and promoting people to strive to transform the objective world.

In Guangdong Province, since last year's provincial committee meeting of active learners of Chairman Mao's works, it has been clearly proposed to place the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. After this meeting, the provincial committee organized a reporting team of active learners of Chairman Mao's works to report in various places more than 200 times, with 430,000 people listening to the reports, which has greatly promoted the study of Chairman Mao's works throughout the province. Subsequently, the provincial committee also summarized and promoted the experiences of several counties, communes, and brigades that did well in learning, and trained 800,000 grassroots cadres and instructors of Chairman Mao's works in batches, with another 80 to 100 million people currently being trained. This has further promoted the enthusiasm of farmers studying Chairman Mao's works throughout the province. The typical experiences of leading cadres in Dongguan and Suixi counties taking the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and strengthening the leadership of the county's study movement are being promoted throughout Guangdong Province. Recently, various communes, production brigades, and production teams in Suixi County have held a meeting to share experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, with 270,000 grassroots cadres and community members participating in the study and 26,000 people speaking on stage. Now, in many rural areas of this province, 70-80% of adults regularly participate in the study of Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses of peasants regard Chairman Mao's words as the highest instructions, take Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the old fool who moved mountains as examples, consciously transform their worldviews, and their spiritual faces and the production faces of the countryside are undergoing daily and monthly changes.

The experience of Guangdong once again proves that Mao Zedong Thought is the most effective weapon for educating peasants. Using Mao Zedong Thought to educate peasants, helping them transform their old worldviews and establish communist worldviews, will definitely establish a highly proletarianized and combat-ready agricultural army in our country.

In Shanxi Province, according to reports from April this year, 180,000 study groups of Chairman Mao's works have been organized in rural areas across the province, with nearly 3 million peasants and grassroots cadres participating in the study. The leading cadres of Meng County have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, carried out the thought reform of county-level leading organs and cadres, launched a mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works across the county, promoted the advanced experience of Dazhai Brigade, and achieved great successes in promoting the thought reform of grassroots cadres and peasants across the county and changing the rural landscape. The experience of this county has also been widely promoted across Shanxi Province. Since the second half of last year, more than 1,100 active learners who participated in the provincial-level study meetings of active learners of Chairman Mao's works across various systems, more than 4,000 active learners who participated in the prefecture-level meetings, and 20,000 active learners who participated in the county-level meetings. These active learners are not only propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought but also organizers of the study movement of Chairman Mao's works; they are not only pioneers in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works but also heroes and models in various industries and fronts. The many precious experiences they have created and accumulated in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, combining theory with practice, are being widely spread and bearing fruit among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and people across the province.

In Shanghai, a city with more than a million workers, the working class has always been at the forefront of the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works. They study Chairman Mao's works with revolutionary feelings, revolutionary will, and revolutionary methods, making themselves conscious revolutionary fighters of the proletariat, and have created one outstanding achievement after another in the three great revolutionary movements. Shanghai workers say: "Mao Zedong Thought is the basis for being a person, the soul of life, the source of strength, the guide to action, the weapon of struggle, and the fundamental of revolution." The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently issued a decision to strengthen the leadership of the mass study movement, seriously reviewed and summarized the situation and experience of various units in carrying out the mass study movement, and held an experience exchange meeting on studying Chairman Mao's works with more than 2,500 active learners and leading cadres from various units participating. Currently, the study movement of Chairman Mao's works is being carried out more vigorously and deeply among the workers and the broad masses of Shanghai.

These situations fully demonstrate that in the current mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the Chinese people, a new situation of "Mao Zedong Thought leading, cadres leading at all levels" has begun to appear in various places and fronts across the country.

When we review the situation of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in our country over the past few years, we must also emphasize that in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is being carried out extensively and deeply, this great mass study movement has appeared in a new upsurge. The broad masses of workers and peasants have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the Cultural Revolution, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, swept away all ghosts and monsters, and shown unparalleled revolutionary momentum and fearless fighting spirit. Chen Yonggui, the party secretary of Dazhai Brigade, and the poor and lower-middle peasants of this brigade said well: "The enemy opposes our study of Chairman Mao's works, which shows that we have studied correctly. Not only should we study for this generation, but our descendants should also study, passing it down from generation to generation, never stopping." "We must definitely protect Mao Zedong Thought and never lose the cause of the revolution." "After reading Chairman Mao's books, we can overthrow the old world, create a new world, and also defend the new world."

Now, the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought has deeply taken root among the 700 million people in our country and will be passed down for thousands of generations, constantly flourishing. People can fully expect that after this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the Chinese people will surge from one high tide to another, from one high tide to another.

    关系我国和全世界革命前途的具有划时代意义的伟大创举
    全国人民活学活用毛主席著作群众运动空前高涨
    学习解放军突出政治、突出毛泽东思想，人人读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事毛泽东思想在七亿人民中普及，几年来在三大革命运动中、在当前文化大革命中连连取得辉煌胜利
    新华社二日讯　本社记者报道：一个活学活用毛主席著作的伟大群众运动，正以人类历史上空前宏伟的巨大规模，在我国人民中广泛深入地蓬勃发展。
    “读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事！”——这已经成为我国广大工农兵和人民群众共同的行动口号。
    我国人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，战无不胜的毛泽东思想在我国七亿人民中的普及，这是具有重大历史意义的伟大创举。它是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得彻底胜利的根本保证；是防止产生修正主义和防止资本主义复辟的百年大计，千年大计，万年大计；也是关系到我国和全世界革命前途的具有划时代意义的伟大事件。
    这几年来我国人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，有着两个极其鲜明的特点：一个是广大工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子表现了迫切要求掌握毛泽东思想的高度革命自觉，他们怀着最强烈的阶级感情和以最顽强的革命毅力学习毛主席著作，对毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰和无限崇拜；一个是在各条战线、各个地方的许多领导部门和领导干部中，已经有越来越多的人认识到突出政治、突出毛泽东思想的重大意义，认识到是否突出毛泽东思想是关系到我们整个国家和世界命运的头等大事，因此他们带头学习并且加强对群众学习运动的领导，把大学毛主席著作放到了一切工作的首位。
    目前，在我国各条战线上，从城市到农村，从海防到边疆，象大庆铁人王进喜，大寨陈永贵，解放军的廖初江、丰福生、黄祖示等这些怀着强烈的阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作的先进人物，正在成批地涌现。全国人民活学活用毛主席著作的伟大群众运动，呈现出来了一片前浪带后浪、后浪推前浪的令人鼓舞的生动景象。广大工农兵群众掌握了毛泽东思想，已经变成伟大的物质力量。全国各地，越来越多的工农兵群众树立了一心为革命，一切为革命，全心全意为人民服务的世界观，掌握了“一分为二”的对立统一规律和辩证唯物主义的认识论，在三大革命运动中创造了一个又一个光辉的胜利。
    上海工人出身的电光源专家蔡祖泉，从十四岁进工厂当学徒，吹了十几年玻璃。他所在的复旦大学玻璃工厂，经常需要氢灯、氙灯，我国不会造，帝国主义和修正主义就借机卡我们的脖子。蔡祖泉反复学习了毛主席的“老三篇”，他想：“敌人欺侮我们的国家就是欺侮中国工人阶级！我们一定要长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风，为革命为人民而自己创造，同他们斗！”四年来，他和实验室的同志们一起，遵循毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》和“从战争学习战争”的教导，边干边学，在上级党委和有关单位大力帮助下，先后制成了十多种新型电光源，为我国电光源事业填补了空白。
    太原纺织厂青年细纱工解悦，几年来遵照毛主席的教导，摸索和掌握接头规律，坚持运用“一分为二”，学别人之长，补自己之短，胜不骄，败不馁，不断实践，不断前进，现在已能看一千六百个纱锭，被称为“骑在客观规律马上”的人。
    江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队贫农老大娘顾阿桃，已经五十多岁了，一字不识。她从去年在社会主义教育运动中开始学习毛主席著作，一直坚持天天听，天天学，在她心里牢牢地记下了“三个人和一把扫帚”，懂得了如何闹革命和如何做人的大道理。她牢记住的三个人就是张思德、白求恩和老愚公，一把扫帚就是批评与自我批评。她说，咱们要天天学习张思德、白求恩和愚公移山的精神，一辈子为人民服务；要天天拿起批评与自我批评这把扫帚，扫掉自己思想上的脏东西。她越学劲头越大，不仅能够把“老三篇”和《反对自由主义》里的许多警句一字不差地背下来，并且天天用这些话来检查自己的行动。现在，这位五十多岁的普通贫农家庭妇女，已经变成胸怀革命大志的好社员，决心当好农村社会主义的顶梁柱。
    守卫在喜马拉雅山冰峰雪岭中的西藏军区查果拉边防队，带着毛主席著作，在海拔五千多米的地区安下了营盘。这里风寒雪深，空气稀薄，但是战士们学习毛主席著作的空气却十分浓厚。他们说：“查果拉确实什么都缺，这里没有水，没有草，只有冰天雪地和风化了的石砾。但是，我们有了毛泽东思想这个最强大的思想武器，就什么也不怕。”他们用愚公移山的精神背石上山修营房，劈山挖石找水源，终于在高山上扎下了根。在空气稀薄的高山上，战士们天天学习毛主席著作。书不够用，他们挤出一切空隙时间用手抄，一个星期中抄下了一百多篇毛主席的文章。战士们说：“一天不读毛主席的书，就好象雪山中没了太阳。天天读毛主席的书，红红的太阳就挂在我们的心窝上。”
    这样动人的事例何止万千！我国广大工农兵和人民群众迫切要求掌握毛泽东思想的高度革命自觉，是任何人也阻挠不了的历史潮流。一小撮资产阶级“权威”老爷们挥舞“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”三根大棒，妄图阻挡这个历史潮流，破坏全国人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，岂不是螳臂当车，蚍蜉撼树，白日做梦！
    许多领导部门和革命干部自觉地带头学习并加强对群众学习运动的领导，这是广大工农兵活学活用毛主席著作这个伟大群众运动得以持续发展的一个重要因素。近几年来，全国各地在党中央和毛主席“学习解放军”的号召下，首先认真学习解放军突出政治、突出毛泽东思想的伟大创举，以毛泽东思想来统帅一切、推动一切和改造一切，大张旗鼓地推广解放军活学活用毛主席著作的成功经验，大搞学习毛主席著作的群众运动，已经取得了重大成果。全国各省（市）、自治区，从基层单位到领导机关，出现了许多焦裕禄式的活学活用毛主席著作的好干部。在近几年来农村和城市的社会主义教育运动中，中央和各地派出的大批工作队干部，特别是人民解放军参加社会主义教育运动的干部，在运动中带头活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想灌输到工农群众中去，对改变劳动人民的精神面貌和推动人们去努力改造客观世界，都发生了很好的作用和深远的影响。
    在广东省，自从去年省委召开了全省学习毛主席著作积极分子会议，便明确提出把学习毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位。这次会议以后，省委结合城乡社会主义教育运动，组织学习毛主席著作积极分子报告团到各地报告二百多场，有四十三万人听了报告，对全省学习毛主席著作运动起了很大的推动作用。接着，省委又总结和推广了一批学习好的县、公社和大队的经验，分期分批地集训了农村基层干部和学习毛主席著作辅导员八十万人，正在集训的还有八十万到一百万人，这就进一步推动了全省农民学习毛主席著作的热潮。东莞、遂溪两县领导干部带头活学活用毛主席著作并加强全县学习运动领导的典型经验，正在广东全省加以推广。遂溪县各公社、生产大队和生产队，最近普遍召开了一次活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会，参加学习的基层干部和社员共达二十七万多人，上台讲的共二万六千多人。现在，这个省的许多农村，经常参加毛主席著作学习的农民已达到成年人的百分之七八十，广大农民把毛主席的话当作最高指示，以张思德、白求恩、老愚公的形象为榜样，自觉地改造世界观，他们的精神面貌和农村的生产面貌正在发生日新月异的变化。
    广东的经验再一次证明，毛泽东思想是教育农民的最有效的武器。用毛泽东思想教育农民，帮助他们改造旧的世界观，树立共产主义的世界观，就一定可以在我国建立起一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的农业大军。
    在山西省，据今年四月的报道，全省农村中已经组织起毛主席著作学习小组十八万个，参加学习的农民群众和基层干部将近三百万人。盂县领导干部活学活用毛主席著作，大搞县级领导机关和县级干部的思想革命化，在全县范围内大搞学习毛主席著作的群众运动，推广大寨大队的先进经验，在促进全县农村基层干部、广大农民的思想革命化和改变农村面貌方面，都取得了巨大成就。这个县的经验，也在山西全省得到了普遍推广。去年下半年以来，全省参加省一级各系统学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议的积极分子有一千一百多人，参加专区一级会议的积极分子有四千多人，参加县一级会议的积极分子有两万人。这些积极分子既是毛泽东思想的宣传者，又是毛主席著作学习运动的组织者；既是活学活用毛主席著作的带头人，又是各行各业、各条战线上的英雄模范。他们创造和积累的活学活用毛主席著作、理论和实践相结合的许多宝贵经验，正在全省广大工农兵和人民群众中广泛流传，开花结果。
    在有着一百多万工人的上海市，工人阶级在学习毛主席著作的群众运动中一直走在最前面。他们用革命的感情、革命的毅力和革命的方法活学活用毛主席著作，使自己成为自觉的无产阶级革命战士，在三大革命运动中创造了一个又一个优异的成绩。上海工人说：“毛泽东思想是做人的依据，生命的灵魂，力量的源泉，行动的指南，战斗的武器，革命的根本。”中共上海市委为加强对群众学习运动的领导，最近专门发布了决定，认真检查总结了各单位开展群众学习运动的情况和经验，并且召开了有两千五百多名学习积极分子和各单位领导干部参加的学习毛主席著作经验交流会。目前，毛主席著作学习运动正在上海全市工人和广大群众中更加蓬勃、更加深入地开展下去。
    这些情况充分说明，在当前我国人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动中，一个“毛泽东思想领先，干部层层带头”的新局面，已开始在我国各地和各条战线上出现。
    当我们回顾这几年来我国工农兵、革命知识分子和革命干部活学活用毛主席著作运动的形势时，还不能不着重地提到，在当前正在广泛深入开展的无产阶级文化大革命中，这个伟大的群众学习运动更出现了新的高潮。广大工农兵群众在文化大革命中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，表现了无比磅礴的革命气概和大无畏的战斗精神。大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵和这个大队的贫下中农说得好：“敌人反对我们学习毛主席著作，正说明我们学对了。不仅我们这一辈子要学，我们的儿孙也要学，要代代相传，一脉不断。”“一定要保住毛泽东思想，革命事业永不丢。”“读了毛主席的书，我们能推翻旧世界，创造新世界，也能保卫新世界。”
    现在，伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想已经在我国七亿人民中深深地扎下了根，而且将千秋万代地传下去，不断发扬光大。人们完全可以预料，经过这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，我国人民活学活用毛主席著作的伟大群众运动，必将一浪高过一浪，由一个高潮涌向又一个高潮。
