	The Northeast and Inner Mongolia forest regions have seen comprehensive development in production and construction. In the first half of the year, wood production and wood processing both exceeded the plan by more than five percent. Hundreds of forestry villages have organized workers' families to participate in production and have established over three hundred half-work, half-study schools.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Harbin on the 18th, the broad masses of workers in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia forest regions are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. While denouncing the anti-party and anti-socialist black gang with pen and tongue, they have unleashed their greatest revolutionary enthusiasm to overfulfill the year's first-half plans for wood production, wood processing, and reforestation.

	At the start of this year, all forestry enterprises in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia forest regions have emphasized politics, placing the organization of workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. Through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the proletarian consciousness of the broad masses of workers has greatly increased, and their revolutionary enthusiasm has further soared. According to statistics from relevant departments, in the first half of this year, wood production and wood processing in the forest regions have both exceeded the plan by more than five percent; the area of agricultural sowing and land reclamation has increased by more than seventy percent compared to last year; the construction of forestry villages has also seen significant development compared to last year. This has led to a new situation of comprehensive development and leapfrog progress in the forest regions.

	In the spring production work, the leading cadres at all levels in the forest regions have taken Jiao Yulu as an example, carrying Chairman Mao's works and luggage to the mountains. They have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works together with the broad masses of workers and carried out production according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Practice has proven that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. Once the broad masses of workers grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they will have clear minds and firm resolve, able to overcome all difficulties and achieve new victories. In the spring production high tide, the broad masses of workers, with a revolutionary spirit of changing heaven and earth, have created large-scale artificial high-yield forests, built forestry villages with a "dry construction" spirit, and reclaimed wasteland and sown grain crops with spades and hoes.

	In forestry production and construction, the broad masses of forestry workers, relying on Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon, have broken through foreign frameworks, taken Daqing as an example, and adhered to the principles of combining afforestation with logging, agriculture with forestry, urban with rural, and industry with agriculture. They have comprehensively strengthened the socialist construction of the forest regions. Currently, in the forest regions, hundreds of forestry new villages have organized tens of thousands of family members to participate in wood processing and agricultural sideline production, and have established 383 half-work, half-study schools. The entire forest region presents a prosperous scene.

　　东北内蒙古林区生产建设全面发展
　　上半年木材生产和木材加工都超过百分之五以上完成计划；数百营林新村组织职工家属参加了生产，并办起三百多所半工半读学校
    据新华社哈尔滨十八日电　东北、内蒙古林区广大职工群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一面口诛笔伐反党反社会主义黑帮；一面发挥最大的革命干劲，超额完成了今年上半年的木材生产、木材加工和更新造林的计划。
    今年一开始，东北、内蒙古林区各林业企业就突出政治，把组织职工活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。通过活学活用毛主席著作，广大职工群众的无产阶级觉悟大大提高，革命的积极性进一步高涨。据有关部门统计，今年上半年，林区的木材生产和木材加工都分别超过百分之五以上完成了计划；农业播种和开荒面积比去年增加百分之七十多；营林村的建设也比去年有很大发展，从而使林区的生产出现了全面发展、全面跃进的新形势。
    林区各级领导干部在春季生产工作中，以焦裕禄为榜样，带着毛主席著作，扛着行李上山。他们同广大职工一起活学活用毛主席著作，根据毛主席的教导来进行生产。实践证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。毛泽东思想一经广大职工群众掌握，就会使他们心明眼亮骨头硬，就能够无坚不摧，无攻不克，排除万难，夺取新的胜利。在春季生产高潮中，广大职工群众，以改天换地的革命精神，大面积营造人工丰产林，用“干打垒”的精神建设营林村，用一锹一镐的办法开垦荒地，播种粮食作物。
    在林业生产建设中，广大林业职工群众依靠毛泽东思想这个强大武器，大破洋框框，以大庆为榜样，本着采育结合、农林结合、城乡结合、工农结合的原则，全面加强林区的社会主义建设。目前，林区数百个营林新村已组织数以万计的家属参加了木材加工和农副业等方面的生产，还开办了三百八十三所半工半读学校，整个林区出现了一片欣欣向荣的景象。
