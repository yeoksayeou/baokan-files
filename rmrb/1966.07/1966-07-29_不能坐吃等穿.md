	One Cannot Just Eat and Wait for Clothes
	Young Female Commune Member  Zhang Baoe

	In the past, I always thought that since our family only has me and my husband, as long as he works, we can have enough to eat! “Marry a man, marry a man, clothes to wear and food to eat,” that’s only natural. After studying Chairman Mao’s books, I realized that my way of thinking was wrong. Comrade Norman Bethune was a highly skilled doctor. Didn’t he have enough to eat in his own country? He came to China to join the revolution, climbing mountains and crossing rivers, unafraid of hardship and fatigue. Was it just for food and clothes? No! He was fighting for the revolutionary cause of the proletariat worldwide, for the happiness of all humanity. But what about me? I thought that as long as I had enough to eat, I didn’t need to work. But this bowl of rice was given to me by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Now, three-fifths of the laboring people in the world are still not liberated. How can I stop working? Once my thoughts improved, I had more energy to work. One time, I returned from my parents’ home, very tired from the journey, but when I saw that there was a shortage of people to irrigate the wheat, I didn’t even go home but followed everyone to irrigate the wheat.

    不能坐吃等穿
    青年女社员  张宝娥
    过去我总觉得家里只有我和丈夫两口人，光他干活就挣上吃啦！“嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭”，是应该的。学了毛主席的书，我知道自己的想法错了。人家白求恩同志是个医术很高的大夫，难道在本国没有饭吃吗？到中国来搞革命，爬山越岭，不怕苦，不怕累，难道就是为了吃饭、穿衣吗？不是！人家是为了全世界无产阶级革命事业，是为了全人类的幸福。可我呢？自己有饭吃就不想干了。自己这碗饭还不是共产党、毛主席给的。现在世界上还有三分之二的劳动人民没有解放，我怎么可以不干了呢！思想提高了，干活就有劲了。有一次我从娘家回来，走得很累，但看到浇麦子缺人，连家没进，就跟着大家去浇麦子了。
