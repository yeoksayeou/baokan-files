The heroic military and civilian population of Gucy County in South Vietnam have, since the beginning of this year, shattered three major American military "sweeps." They have annihilated nearly 4,700 American "elite" troops and destroyed or damaged 119 enemy aircraft.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 9th, our correspondent compiled the following: The heroic military and civilian population of Gucy County in South Vietnam's Gia Dinh Province have, since the beginning of this year, shattered three major American military "sweeps" launched against this county. They have defeated the American imperialists' so-called "elite" troops, leaving them battered and defeated, annihilating nearly 4,700 American troops, shooting down or damaging 119 enemy aircraft, and destroying or damaging 109 tanks, armored vehicles, and military trucks.

The liberated area of Gucy County is located about 30 kilometers northwest of Saigon, like a sharp knife thrust into the heart of the enemy, making the American puppet regime anxious and uneasy.

Since last year, the American puppet regime has designated Gucy's liberated area as one of the "key pacification zones," continuously conducting "sweeps," bombing, shelling, and spreading chemical poisons, attempting to reduce Gucy County to rubble. However, the heroic military and civilian population of Gucy County are fearless in the face of the brutal enemy. They have mobilized the entire population, fully prepared for battle, with the Liberation Army as the backbone, and everyone participating in the fight against the enemy. Using simple weapons and flexible tactics, they have continuously struck the enemy, fully demonstrating the invincible power of people's war, turning Gucy County into an impregnable iron wall. They have shattered the enemy's "sweeps" one after another, annihilating a large number of enemy forces.

The first major "sweep" launched by American imperialism against Gucy County this year began on January 8 and ended on February 24. During the anti-"sweep" battles, the military and civilian population of Gucy County annihilated over 3,300 American invaders, shot down or damaged nearly 90 enemy aircraft, and destroyed or damaged 80 tanks, armored vehicles, and military trucks.

On January 8, the American invaders mobilized over 10,000 American troops and Australian mercenaries, 600 military vehicles, and 200 aircraft of various types to launch a frenzied "sweep" against six communes, including Phu My Hiep, in the northern part of Gucy County, which has a population of only 15,000. The American bandits carried out the inhuman "burn it all, destroy it all, kill it all" policy everywhere, attempting to turn the liberated area of Gucy into a wasteland. The heroic military and civilian population of Gucy County had long seen through the enemy's schemes. They laid a trap, surrounding and annihilating the enemy who came to their doorstep. The Liberation Army and guerrilla forces fought continuously, day and night, attacking the enemy. The military and civilian population of An Phu Commune conducted over 40 battles in seven days, annihilating nearly 300 American bandits, shooting down 7 enemy aircraft, and damaging 12.

After suffering a defeat, the enemy retreated to the northern bank of the river, about two kilometers northeast of Gucy County, attempting to establish a stronghold, control the first and eighth highways, and use them as a springboard to invade the liberated area of Gucy. They also aimed to connect the American strongholds from Tu Du Province to Thua Thien Province, forming a frontline defense in the north of Saigon. However, as soon as the American invaders retreated to this area, the military and civilian population of Gucy County immediately surrounded them, striking fear into their hearts and making them disheveled. From January 24 to February 24, the guerrilla forces and local troops of Gucy County annihilated 1,717 American invaders.

Undeterred, the American invaders launched their second "sweep" on March 29, mobilizing the 2nd Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division and the 7th Regiment of the 5th Division of the puppet army, along with aircraft and armored vehicles, against the southern communes of Dong Phu and others in Gucy County. On April 1, they launched another "sweep" against the northern communes of Phu My Hiep and An Phu. As soon as the American invaders entered this area, they fell into the fires of people's war, suffering heavy losses. The guerrilla forces of each commune tightly pursued the enemy, striking them continuously. After the American troops were exhausted, the Liberation Army and guerrilla forces closely coordinated, launching a sudden attack on the American camp. After a two-hour fierce battle, they annihilated two American companies.

On May 16, the American bandits launched their third major "sweep" against Gucy County. On one hand, they advanced in two columns under the cover of armored vehicles and tanks, and on the other hand, they air-dropped a large number of infantry into the central area of the "sweep" using helicopters, attempting to annihilate the Liberation Army through an internal and external pincer attack.

Although the enemy was cunning, they were no match for the brave and intelligent military and civilian population of Gucy. The guerrilla forces of each commune attacked the enemy everywhere, laid landmines, destroyed roads, and intercepted enemy vehicles. At the same time, the military and civilian population of Gucy County also attacked the enemy's command posts and camps, splitting the enemy and attacking them from the front and rear, making the American invaders restless day and night, with nowhere to turn. By May 27, they had completely shattered this "sweep."

Relying on the great revolutionary spirit and the invincible power of people's war, the military and civilian population of Gucy defeated the entire American "elite" troops equipped with modern weapons. The victory of Gucy's military and civilian population once again proved this unshakable truth: The true iron wall is the thousands and millions of people armed with revolutionary ideas and genuinely supporting the revolution. This iron wall is indestructible by any force.

    英雄的古芝——人民的铜墙铁壁
    南越古芝县军民今年以来粉碎美军三次大规模“扫荡”  歼美国“王牌军”近四千七百名，毁伤敌机一百一十九架
    据新华社河内九日电  本社记者综合报道：英雄的越南南方嘉定省古芝县军民，今年以来粉碎了美国侵略军对这个县发动的三次大规模“扫荡”，把美帝国主义的所谓“王牌军”打得头破血流，一败涂地，共歼灭美军近四千七百名，击落击伤敌机一百十九架，击毁击伤坦克、装甲车、军用车一百零九辆。
    古芝县解放区位于西贡西北三十余公里，象一把锋利的尖刀插在敌人的心脏上，使美伪集团惊慌不安。
    美伪集团从去年起就把古芝解放区作为“重点绥靖区”之一，不断进行“扫荡”、轰炸、炮击、撒放化学毒药，妄图把古芝县夷为平地。但是英雄的古芝县军民在残暴的敌人面前毫不畏惧，全民动员，充分作好了战斗准备，他们以解放军为骨干，全民参加杀敌，依靠战斗村，运用简陋的武器和机智灵活的战术，连续打击敌人，高度发挥了人民战争的无敌威力，把古芝县变成了坚不可摧的铜墙铁壁。他们粉碎了敌人一次又一次的“扫荡”，歼灭了敌军大量有生力量。
    美帝国主义今年对古芝县发动的第一次大“扫荡”从一月八日开始，到二月二十四日结束。古芝县军民在反“扫荡”战斗中，歼灭美国侵略军三千三百多名，击落击伤敌机近九十架，击毁击伤坦克、装甲车、军用车八十辆。
    一月八日，美国侵略者出动了上万名美军和澳大利亚帮凶军、六百辆军车和二百架各种类型的飞机，向古芝县北部只有一万五千人口的富美兴等六个乡发动疯狂的“扫荡”。美国强盗到处灭绝人性地实行“烧光、毁光、杀光”的残暴政策，妄图把古芝解放区变成一片焦土。英雄的古芝县军民早已看透了敌人的阴谋，他们布下了天罗地网，围歼送上门来的敌军。解放军和游击队连续作战，日夜袭击敌人。安富乡军民在七天中连续进行了四十多次战斗，歼灭美国强盗近三百名，击落敌机七架，击伤十二架。
    敌人吃了败仗后，于一月二十四日撤到古芝县城东北两公里的北河地区，企图建立据点，控制第一和第八号公路，作为进犯古芝解放区的跳板，并且把从土龙木省到堤岸省的美军据点连接起来，在西贡北面形成一条前沿防线。但是，当美国侵略军刚撤到这个地区，古芝县军民就立即把他们围困起来，打得他们胆战心惊，狼狈不堪。在一月二十四日到二月二十四日，古芝游击队和地方部队歼灭了一千七百一十七名美国侵略军。
    美国侵略军仍不死心，在三月二十九日又出动美国第二十五步兵师第二旅和伪军第五师第七团，在飞机、装甲车的掩护下，向古芝县南部的东富和等乡发动第二次“扫荡”。四月一日，又到古芝县北部的富美兴、安富等乡“扫荡”。美国侵略军一进入这个地区，就陷入人民战争的火海中，被烧得焦头烂额。各乡游击队紧紧咬住敌人不放，予以连续打击。在美军被拖得疲劳不堪之后，解放军和游击队紧密配合，向美军营地发起突然进攻，经过两小时激战，全歼美军两个连。
    五月十六日，美国强盗发动了对古芝县的第三次大“扫荡”。他们一方面在装甲车和坦克掩护下，分两路展开“钳形攻势”，一方面用直升飞机向“扫荡”地区的中心区空投大量步兵，妄图通过内外夹攻的办法来消灭解放武装力量。
    敌军虽然狡猾，但根本不是英勇机智的古芝军民的对手。各乡的游击队到处袭击敌人、埋地雷、破坏公路，截击敌人军车。同时，古芝县军民还袭击敌军的指挥所和营地，分割敌人，前后堵击，打得美国侵略军日夜不安，走投无路。到五月二十七日，他们又彻底粉碎了这次“扫荡”。
    古芝县军民依靠大无畏的革命精神和人民战争的无敌威力，打败了全部现代化装备的美国“王牌军”。古芝军民的胜利，再一次证明了这样一个颠扑不破的真理：真正的铜墙铁壁是千百万用革命思想武装起来、真心实意拥护革命的人民群众。这个铜墙铁壁是什么力量也打不破的。（附图片）
