The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference sent a cable to the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front. China resolutely supports the Vietnamese people in defeating American imperialism. It condemns the collusion between the Soviet revisionists and India and Britain, which aims to force the Vietnamese people to surrender and accept "peace talks."

New China News Agency, July 22nd: The full text of the cable of support from the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front is as follows:

To the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front:

With immense excitement, we have read the "Letter to All Compatriots" by President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, President Ho Chi Minh's order to mobilize part of the reserve forces, the decision of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to mobilize part of the reserve forces, the communiqué of the Supreme National Defense Council of Vietnam, and the resolution of the special expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front. These documents express the firm resolve of the Vietnamese people to defeat the evil American aggressors, and we express our most resolute support. After President Ho Chi Minh issued the call to battle, the military and civilians in North Vietnam are boiling with enthusiasm and high morale, with hundreds of thousands of young people eagerly enlisting in the army, ready to rush to the front lines to strike the American invaders; the military and civilians in South Vietnam are intensifying their struggle, determined to deal a heavier blow to the American aggressors. We are deeply convinced that the entire Vietnamese people, united around the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, will surely unite in hatred against the enemy and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors!

The solemn declaration made by Chairman Liu Shaoqi of our country at the rally of nearly a million people from all walks of life in the capital in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation fully expresses the unshakable resolve of the 700 million Chinese people to aid Vietnam and resist America. We firmly support Chairman Liu Shaoqi's declaration.

American imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Vietnamese people and the number one enemy of all the people of the world. For many years, the American aggressor troops have invaded South Vietnam, massacring tens of thousands of Vietnamese people. In the past two years, they have expanded the war to North Vietnam. Now, nearly 300,000 American aggressor troops are daily slaughtering people in South Vietnam, and American aggressor planes are daily bombing North Vietnam. Recently, American imperialism has brazenly bombed the Vietnamese people's capital, Hanoi, and the second largest city, Haiphong, escalating the aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious stage. This does not show their strength but is precisely the desperate, cornered performance of a paper tiger. As our country's leader Chairman Mao Zedong has pointed out, "To disrupt, to fail, to disrupt again, to fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The American imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is a vain attempt to force a "peace talk" hoax. President Ho Chi Minh has solemnly declared, "The American imperialists can send 500,000, 1 million, or even more troops to strengthen their aggression against South Vietnam. They can use thousands of planes to strengthen their bombing of North Vietnam. But they will never be able to shake the iron will and resolve of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist American aggression and save the nation." "The Vietnamese people will not be intimidated! Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom." In the face of such a heroic nation, the only thing the American aggressors can find is their own grave!

In the American imperialists' grand scheme of "bombing to force peace talks," the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has played the role of the number one accomplice. In recent days, Moscow has become the center of the "peace talk" conspiracy and the black market for betraying the Vietnamese people. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, in collusion with the Prime Minister of India and the Prime Minister of Britain, has been shouting for the "reconvening of the Geneva Conference," attempting to force the Vietnamese people to accept a humiliating surrender in "peace talks." This is a prelude to a new Eastern Munich of American-Soviet cooperation, a thoroughly evil act.

China and Vietnam are socialist brother countries that are interdependent and share weal and woe. In the struggle against imperialism, our two peoples have always supported each other and fought side by side. The great struggle of the Vietnamese people for national salvation is not only for the independence and freedom of the Vietnamese people but also a great support to our people and all the people of the world. It is the duty of internationalism for the Chinese people to fully support the Vietnamese people. The development of history has determined that our two peoples must unite, fight together, and win together. Our 700 million people are the backbone of the Vietnamese people, and our vast territory is the rear base of the Vietnamese people. We are not afraid of any risks and will not hesitate to pay any price. We will resolutely stand with our Vietnamese brothers and with all revolutionary peoples of the world, firmly supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people until we thoroughly defeat the American aggressors!

The heroic Vietnamese people will surely win, and the evil American imperialism will surely be defeated!

    我政协全国委员会致电越南祖国战线中央委员会
    中国坚决支援越南人民打败美帝
    谴责苏修勾结印英企图迫使越南人民屈辱投降接受“和谈”的阴谋
    新华社二十二日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会给越南祖国战线中央委员会的支持电，全文如下：越南祖国战线中央委员会：
    我们以无比激动的心情阅读了越南民主共和国胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》、胡志明主席颁布的关于动员一部分后备兵员的命令、越南民主共和国国会常务委员会关于动员一部分后备兵员的决定、越南最高国防会议公报和越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团特别扩大会议的决议。这些文件，表达了越南人民决心打败万恶的美国强盗的坚强意志，我们表示最坚决的支持。胡志明主席发出战斗号召以后，越南北方军民热血沸腾，斗志昂扬，数百万青年踊跃报名参军，随时准备奔赴前线，打击美国侵略者；越南南方军民加紧战斗，决心给美国强盗更沉重的打击。我们深信，团结在越南劳动党和胡志明主席周围的全越南人民，一定能够同仇敌忾，彻底打败美国强盗！
    我国刘少奇主席在首都各界近百万人支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会上发表的庄严的声明，充分地表达了七亿中国人民援越抗美不可动摇的决心。我们坚决拥护刘少奇主席的声明。
    美帝国主义是越南人民不共戴天的死敌，是全世界人民的头号敌人。多少年来，美国侵略军闯进越南南方，屠杀了数十万越南人民。近两年来，又把战争扩大到越南北方。现在，美国近三十万侵略军，正在越南南方天天疯狂杀人，美国强盗飞机正在越南北方天天疯狂轰炸。最近，美帝国主义又悍然轰炸越南人民的首都河内和第二大城市海防市，把侵略越南的战争升到了一个新的更加严重的阶段。这并不表示它强大，而正是它走投无路、狗急跳墙的纸老虎表现。正如我国人民领袖毛泽东主席指出的，“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防是妄想逼出一个“和谈”的骗局。胡志明主席已经庄严宣告，美帝国主义“可以出动五十万、一百万或者更多的军队来加强对越南南方的侵略战争。他们可以使用成千架飞机来加强对越南北方的轰炸。但是，他们绝不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。”“越南人民是不会被吓倒的！没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。”在这样一个英雄民族的面前，美国侵略者所能找到的，只能是自己的坟墓！
    在美帝国主义“以炸迫和”的大阴谋中，苏联修正主义领导集团充当了头号帮凶的角色。这些天来，莫斯科成了进行“和谈”阴谋的中心，出卖越南人民的黑市。苏联修正主义领导集团和印度总理、英国首相相互勾结，叫嚷要“重新召开日内瓦会议”，企图迫使越南人民接受屈辱投降的“和谈”。这是美苏合作的新的东方慕尼黑的预兆，是一个彻头彻尾的罪恶行动。
    中国和越南是唇齿相依、患难与共的社会主义兄弟国家，我们两国人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中从来都是相互支持的，并肩战斗的。越南人民伟大的抗美救国的正义斗争，不但是为了越南人民的独立、自由，并且对我国人民和全世界人民也是重大的支持。中国人民全力支援越南人民是义不容辞的国际主义义务。历史的发展决定了我们两国人民要团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。我们七亿人民是越南人民的后盾，我们辽阔的国土是越南人民的后方。我们不怕冒任何风险，不惜付出任何代价，坚决同兄弟的越南人民站在一起，同全世界的革命人民站在一起，坚决支援越南人民的正义斗争，直到彻底打败美国侵略者！
    英雄的越南人民必胜，万恶的美帝国主义必败！
