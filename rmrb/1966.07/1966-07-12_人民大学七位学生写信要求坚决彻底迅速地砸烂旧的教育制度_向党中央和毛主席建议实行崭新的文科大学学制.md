Seven students from Renmin University have written a letter to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, demanding the complete, thorough, and swift smashing of the old educational system. They propose implementing a completely new system for liberal arts universities.

Editor's Note: The letter from Li Yusheng and six other students of Renmin University to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is filled with boundless love for the Party, Chairman Mao, and socialism. It is filled with the daring spirit of revolution to think boldly, speak boldly, and act boldly. This letter is a red volunteer pledge from these revolutionary youths raised under the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, determined to join the fiery struggle of the three great revolutionary movements and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers forever. It is a challenge to break with the old educational ideas and old educational system, daring to thoroughly defeat the authority of the bourgeoisie. We enthusiastically support their revolutionary initiative to dare to practice and dare to combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and we enthusiastically support their active request to graduate early.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Youth is the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force. They are the most eager to learn and have the least conservative ideas, especially in the socialist era."

From these revolutionary youths, we see the rapid growth of the younger generation nurtured by the great thought of Mao Zedong, seeing them take up the revolutionary banner stained with the blood of revolutionary martyrs and march forward vigorously on the broad road of socialism. The future and hope of our great motherland lie in them.

Dear Party Central Committee, Dear Chairman Mao:

After hearing the letter from the students of Class 4, Grade 3 of Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School and Class 5, Grade 3 of Beijing No. 4 Middle School, and the editorial of People's Daily, we could not contain our excitement, and tears welled up in our eyes. These little generals spoke out what we have been holding in our hearts for years, expressing the wishes of revolutionary youths. It boosted our morale and crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

We are students of Renmin University, and we are also victims of the old educational system.

For years, every directive you gave on educational work has touched our hearts, but those "authoritative" gentlemen have always used various rules and regulations to resist these directives. They do not implement Chairman Mao's directives from above, nor do they listen to the voices of the masses from below. Their sinister purpose is to attempt to make the cause of our revolutionary forebears have no successors, to attempt to make our proletariat die out, and to try to turn us into tools for the restoration of capitalism! Today, we declare to these bourgeois "authoritative" gentlemen: your beautiful dreams will never come true! You do not listen to Chairman Mao's words; we do! You do not implement Chairman Mao's directives; we do!

Dear Party Central Committee, Dear Chairman Mao, we are revolutionary youths born in the revolutionary fire, raised under the Party's nurturing, and advancing under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought. Some say we are always filled with gunpowder. Yes! In this Cultural Revolution, we will, according to your directives, join the workers, peasants, and soldiers to resolutely, thoroughly, and swiftly smash all old educational systems and open fire on the bourgeois "authoritative" gentlemen!

We believe that the current system of education is too long and has many crimes, and it must be shortened!

The crimes are as follows:

1. This system fundamentally violates Chairman Mao's theory of knowledge, treating book knowledge as the ultimate treasure, looking down on practice, and being detached from the workers and peasants and the three great revolutionary movements. The result is either revisionism or dogmatism.

2. It expands the three great differences and serves the bourgeoisie in passing down their legacy. Those bourgeois "authoritative" gentlemen fear that students will spend too little time in school, fear that they will read too few books, fear that they will be influenced too little by the bourgeoisie, and fear that they will not become filial sons and virtuous grandsons of the bourgeoisie!

3. The current system of education is six years of primary school, six years of middle school, and generally five years of university. From the age of eight to university graduation, one is already twenty-five or twenty-six years old, and the most precious time of one's life is spent in school. Seventeen years of hard study and hardship truly waste youth and mislead young people.

4. Teachers and students in schools spend their days buried in books, reading dead books, and not caring about politics, unaware that there is another world outside the school.

5. The current students in school live in high-rise buildings, eat rice and wheat flour, read ancient and foreign "classics," are filled with ideas of fame and fortune, think about personal success and family, and walk the path of being experts without political awareness. If this continues, how can the children of workers and poor peasants not forget their roots?

6. They emphasize so-called systematic knowledge, actually promoting dogmatism, metaphysics, and trivial philosophy.

7. The content of study is extensive and repetitive, the more one studies, the more confused one becomes. Teachers engage in meaningless research, and students are stuffed with knowledge like ducks. They spend days, months, and years buried in piles of old papers, resulting in young people being confused and weak.

8. The state urgently needs talent, but students cannot leave the school gates. Due to the long duration of education, the turnover rate of schools is extremely low, which cannot quickly meet the needs of the state; it also cannot allow a large number of workers, children of poor peasants, and demobilized soldiers to enroll.

9. It wastes teachers and manpower. If the duration of education could be shortened by half, then one teacher could teach twice as many students.

10. Due to long-term detachment from practice and class struggle, many students in school have formed a bourgeois worldview, which is difficult to change. As a result, the university students trained with so much money from the state are not welcome. Such students are far inferior to those with only primary and junior high school education but who have been tempered through production struggles or practical work; they are even more inferior to those who have only read a few books, or even no books at all, but have been tempered through long-term revolutionary struggles and practical work, such as revolutionary veterans; they are even more inferior to advanced figures like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ou Yanghai, Mai Xiande, Chen Yonggui, Wang Tiexin, and Li Suwen. It is clear that true revolutionaries are not cultivated in schools, and true heroes cannot be produced in schools.

Therefore, we propose:

1. Once the Cultural Revolution is over, all students who have studied for more than two years in liberal arts universities should graduate early and be assigned to the three great revolutionary movements to combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time and unconditionally.

2. Liberal arts universities must use Chairman Mao's works as textbooks and class struggle as the main course.

3. In the future, the duration of liberal arts universities should be changed to one, two, or three years according to Chairman Mao's directives and the needs of the state, and each year should allocate a certain amount of time to participate in industrial and agricultural production, learn military affairs, and participate in social class struggles.

4. Teaching methods should be based on self-study and discussion, with teachers providing appropriate guidance, promoting democratic teaching, following the mass line, and resolutely abolishing the method of stuffing students with knowledge like ducks.

5. In the future, universities should enroll youths who have been tempered in the three great revolutionary movements, have progressive political thoughts, and have a certain level of education, not necessarily requiring a high school diploma, so that outstanding individuals from a large number of workers, poor peasants, and demobilized soldiers can enroll.

Dear Party Central Committee, Dear Chairman Mao, the Party and the state have nurtured us, and the people have fed us with rice and wheat flour. Our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, has placed unlimited hopes in our generation. How can we still hesitate and wait? Since the revolutionary little generals dare to smash the old admission system, we should have the courage to break free from the constraints of the old system of education and take revolutionary action to graduate early!

Dear Party Central Committee, Dear Chairman Mao, it is you who teach us that on the revolutionary road, "many things, always urgent," we should have the heroic spirit of "a million years too long, only strive for the moment." We are so eager for you to approve our request! Once the Cultural Revolution is over, we will step out of the school gates, go to practical work to temper ourselves, go to the fiery struggle to temper and transform ourselves, go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers to make up for our education, and let them issue us a "certificate of ideological graduation." We will give up our university positions to those truly outstanding revolutionary youths who have been tempered through the three great revolutionary movements and let them study further.

We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the surging waves of the Cultural Revolution will thoroughly bury the old educational system! A completely new educational system of communism will be born in socialist China! The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will fly high in the educational battlefield of the proletariat! Forever fly high!

Finally, once again, please rest assured, Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will be as revolutionary as our revolutionary forebears, charging into the battlefield of proletarian education, fighting for the defense of Mao Zedong Thought all our lives, and ensuring that China will never change color!

The future world belongs to us!

Wishing our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, eternal life!

　　人民大学七位学生写信要求坚决彻底迅速地砸烂旧的教育制度
　　向党中央和毛主席建议实行崭新的文科大学学制
    以毛主席著作为教材，以阶级斗争为主课；缩短学制，让学生提前到三大革命运动中去锻炼改造，长期地、无条件地与工农兵相结合；招收广大工人、贫下中农和复员军人中的优秀分子入学。
    编者按：中国人民大学李豫生等七位同学给党中央和毛主席的信，充满了对党对毛主席对社会主义的无限热爱，充满了敢想，敢说，敢闯的大无畏的革命精神。这封信，是这些在毛泽东思想红旗下成长的革命青年，决心投入到火热的三大革命的群众运动中去，永远为工农兵服务的红色志愿书，是他们决心同旧的教育思想、旧的教育制度决裂，敢于彻底打垮资产阶级“权威”的挑战书。我们热烈支持他们这种勇于到实践中去锻炼，敢于同工农兵相结合的革命倡议，热烈支持他们的积极要求提前毕业的革命志愿。
    毛主席教导我们：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。他们最肯学习，最少保守思想，在社会主义时代尤其是这样。”
    从这些革命青年身上，我们看到了在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，青年一代的迅速成长，看到了他们接过革命先烈用鲜血染红的革命大旗，在社会主义的康庄大道上奋勇前进。我们伟大祖国的前途和希望，正是寄托在他们身上。敬爱的党中央、敬爱的毛主席：
    当我们听完北京市女一中高三（四）班和北京四中高三（五）班同学写给您的信和人民日报的社论后，无论如何也抑制不住心头的激动，热泪夺眶而出。这些革命小将们说出了我们几年来憋在心里想说的话，说出了我们革命青年的心愿，它长了我们无产阶级的志气，灭了资产阶级的威风。
    我们是中国人民大学的学生，也是旧教育制度的受害者。
    多少年来，您每次对教育工作的指示都讲到了我们的心眼里，可那些“权威”老爷们，却总是千方百计地用各种条条框框对抗这些指示。他们上不执行毛主席的指示，下不听取群众的呼声，他们阴险的目的就是妄想让我们革命先辈开创的事业后继无人，妄想让我们无产阶级断子绝孙，企图使我们青年变成资本主义复辟的工具！今天，我们要正告这些资产阶级“权威”老爷们：你们的黄粱美梦永远也不会实现！你们不听毛主席的话，我们听！你们不执行毛主席的指示，我们执行！
    敬爱的党中央，敬爱的毛主席，我们是在革命的炮火中诞生，在党的哺育下成长，在毛泽东思想阳光照耀下前进的革命青年。有人说我们整天充满了火药味。对！在这场文化大革命中，我们就是要按照您的指示，和工农兵群众一起，坚决、彻底、迅速地砸烂一切旧的教育制度，向资产阶级“权威”老爷们猛烈开火！
    我们认为，现行的学制年限太长，罪状累累，必须缩短！
    其罪状如下：
    一、这种学制根本违反了毛主席的认识论，把书本知识奉为至宝，轻视实践，脱离工农，脱离三大革命运动，其结果不出修正主义，就出教条主义。
    二、扩大三大差别，为资产阶级传子续孙。那些资产阶级“权威”老爷们，唯恐青年们在校时间太短，唯恐读的本本太少，唯恐受资产阶级影响不深，唯恐他们成不了资产阶级的孝子贤孙！
    三、现行学制小学六年、中学六年、大学一般五年，从八岁上学到大学毕业，已二十五、六岁了，在学校的时间占去了人的生命中最宝贵的时间。十七年寒窗苦熬苦度，真是误人青春，误人子弟。
    四、学校的师生每日钻书堆，读死书，不问政治，不知校外别有天地。
    五、现在在校的学生是：住的高楼大厦，吃的大米白面，读古洋“名著”，灌的名利思想，想的个人成名成家，走的白专道路。长此下去，工人和贫下中农的子弟怎么会不忘本呢？
    六、拚命强调所谓系统知识，实际上是在宣传教条主义、形而上学和烦琐哲学。
    七、学习内容庞杂重复，越学越糊涂。教师在那里进行无聊的考证，填鸭式的灌注，学生则整天、整月、整年埋在故纸堆里，其后果是弄得青年们晕头转向，体弱多病。
    八、国家急需人材，学生迟迟不能走出校门。由于学制太长，学校的周转率极低，既不能尽快满足国家的需要；又不能使广大工人、贫下中农子弟、复员军人入学。
    九、浪费师资，浪费人力。如果能够把学制缩短一半，那么一个教师，就可以多教出一倍学生。
    十、由于长期脱离实践，脱离阶级斗争，不少学生在学校形成了一套资产阶级的人生观，改也不好改，结果国家花费那么多钱培养出来的大学生是不受欢迎的。这样的学生远不如那些只有小学、初中文化水平，但经过生产斗争或实际工作锻炼过的基层干部；更不如那些只读过几天书，甚至一天书也没有读过，却经过长期革命斗争和实际工作锻炼出来的革命老前辈；更不如雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、麦贤得、陈永贵、王铁人、李素文等先进人物。可见，真正的革命者不是学校里培养的，真正的英雄不能在学校里产生。
    因此，我们建议：
    一、这次文化大革命一结束，凡文科大学读过两年以上的学生，一律提前毕业，分配到三大革命运动中去，长期地、无条件地与工农兵相结合。
    二、文科大学必须以毛主席著作为教材，以阶级斗争为主课。
    三、今后文科大学学制应根据毛主席的指示和国家的需要，改为一年、二年、三年，而且每年要拿出一定的时间参加工农业生产劳动，学军事和参加社会的阶级斗争。
    四、教学方法应以自学、讨论为主，教师适当辅导，发扬民主教学，走群众路线，坚决废除灌注式、填鸭式的教学方法。
    五、今后大学应招收在三大革命运动中经过锻炼、政治思想进步、具有一定文化水平的青年，不一定非高中毕业不可，使那些广大工人、贫下中农和复员军人中的优秀分子能够入学。
    敬爱的党中央，敬爱的毛主席，党和国家培养我们，人民用大米白面养活我们，最敬爱的领袖毛主席把无限的希望寄托在我们这一代身上，我们怎么能还犹豫等待呢？既然革命的小将们敢于砸烂旧的升学制度，我们就应有勇气冲破旧的学制的束缚，采取提前毕业的革命行动！
    敬爱的党中央，敬爱的毛主席，是您教导我们，在革命的道路上“多少事，从来急”，应该有“一万年太久，只争朝夕”的英雄气概。我们多么渴望您能批准我们的请求啊！等这次文化大革命一结束就走出学校门，到实际工作中去摔打，到火热的斗争中去锻炼改造，到工农兵群众中去补课，请他们发给“思想毕业证书”。把大学的位置让给那些经过三大革命锻炼的、真正优秀的革命青年，入学深造。
    我们坚信，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，无产阶级文化大革命汹涌澎湃的浪潮，必将把旧的教育制度彻底埋葬！一个共产主义的、完全崭新的教育制度即将在社会主义中国诞生！毛泽东思想伟大红旗，将在无产阶级的教育阵地上高高飘扬！永远飘扬！
    最后，再一次请党中央、毛主席放心，我们会象革命前辈一样坚决革命，为占领无产阶级教育阵地冲锋陷阵，为保卫毛泽东思想奋斗终生，使中国永不变色！
    未来的世界是属于我们的！
          祝
    我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
