Shanghai, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, held a massive rally and demonstration today with 800,000 people. They represented the 10 million people of Shanghai, expressing their most resolute and fervent support for Chairman Liu Shaoqi's solemn declaration and Chairman Ho Chi Minh's battle call. They declared their determination to fear no risks and spare no great sacrifices, resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people until they completely drive out the American aggressors from Vietnam.

Leaders from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's East China Bureau, as well as the Party, government, and military leaders of Shanghai, attended today's meeting. Among them were Han Zheyi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's East China Bureau, Ma Shui, Wang Yiping, Liang Guobin, and Yang Xiguang, Wang Shaoyong, Deputy Mayors of Shanghai Song Jiven, Li Gancheng, Shi Ying, Zhang Chengzong, Jin Zhonghua, Zhao Zukang, Vice Chairmen of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Chen Wangdao, Wang Zhizhong, and leaders of the military units stationed in Shanghai, Yu Guangmao, Rao Shoukun, Qu Daowen, as well as leaders of various people's organizations and democratic parties in Shanghai.

Vietnamese students and trainees in Shanghai, as well as friends from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, were invited to participate in the rally and demonstration.

Liang Guobin, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that American imperialism is the most savage and vicious enemy of all the people in the world. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique acts as the number one accomplice of American imperialism, playing a shameful role. However, in the face of the fearless and heroic Vietnamese people, all the tricks and conspiracies of American imperialism and its running dogs will surely be thoroughly foiled, and the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America will surely be thoroughly victorious.

Liang Guobin said: The people of Shanghai are closely watching the developments in Vietnam and have already made all preparations. As long as the Vietnamese people need us, and as long as the motherland calls, we will contribute our greatest efforts to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people.

Next, a representative of the Vietnamese students and trainees in Shanghai, Duan Funi, spoke at the meeting. Duan Funi said, Chairman Ho's "Letter to the People of the Whole Country" has further aroused the patriotic spirit of the 31 million people of our country. We, the Vietnamese people, vow: We will win the eternal life of our motherland with our lives.

Duan Funi said passionately, Chairman Liu's declaration is a heavy blow to American imperialism and a very precious support and great encouragement to the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people have always supported our country in defeating the American aggressors, making the greatest efforts. On behalf of all the students and trainees in Shanghai, I express my deepest and most sincere gratitude to the great Chinese people, the great Chinese Communist Party, and the beloved Chairman Mao.

Zhang Qi, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and Chen Wangdao, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, spoke on behalf of various people's organizations and democratic parties, the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-party democrats at the meeting, expressing their determination to support the Vietnamese people.

After the meeting, 800,000 people held a grand demonstration. The entire city of Shanghai was filled with a strong atmosphere of supporting Vietnam and resisting America, brimming with the internationalist fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam.
