Mexican prominent figures praise Mao Zedong Thought
The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will surely be planted all over the world
The world's people will achieve a bright future with Mao Zedong Thought

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Mexico City, Mexican famous painter Leonel Padilla said on the 20th of this month to a Xinhua reporter about his feelings on studying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth.

Padilla enthusiastically pointed out that the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America must hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, because Mao Zedong Thought is the compass for all revolutionary peoples in the world. The Chinese people, by grasping this compass, have already achieved revolutionary victory. Similarly, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, by grasping this compass, will surely achieve revolutionary victory. He emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the revolutionary peoples of the world and increasingly inspiring their revolutionary will. The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will surely be planted all over the world.

Padilla pointed out that Chairman Mao Zedong has comprehensively and systematically developed Marxism-Leninism. He has developed theories related to the strategy, tactics, politics, and economy of revolution, as well as theories related to the culture and arts of revolution, to the highest level, making them even more rich in practical guiding significance.

Padilla also pointed out that while the Soviet revisionist leadership is castrating Marxism-Leninism, betraying the revolution, and kneeling down to U.S. imperialism, "we must hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and plant it all over the world."

Mexican famous social activist Dr. Fanny Sanchez Morelos, who has visited China, said that Mao Zedong Thought is producing an increasingly immeasurable influence all over the world, and it is a factor determining the development of the world revolution. She said that the Chinese people have created today's China by relying on Mao Zedong Thought. The peoples of all countries, with Mao Zedong Thought, will achieve a bright future.

    墨西哥著名人士歌颂毛泽东思想
    毛泽东思想红旗必定插遍全球
    世界人民有了毛泽东思想就会取得一个光明的未来
    据新华社墨西哥城电　墨西哥著名画家莱昂内尔·帕迪利亚二十日在这里对新华社记者谈到他学习《毛泽东选集》的感想时说，毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理。
    帕迪利亚热情洋溢地指出，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，因为毛泽东思想是世界上所有革命人民的指南针。中国人民由于掌握了这个指南针，已经获得革命的胜利。同样，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民掌握了这个指南针，肯定也会取得革命的胜利。他强调指出，毛泽东思想已越来越深入世界革命人民的心里，越来越鼓舞他们的革命意志。毛泽东思想的红旗肯定会插遍世界各地。
    帕迪利亚指出，毛泽东主席全面而又系统地发展了马克思列宁主义，他把有关革命的战略、战术、政治和经济的理论直到有关革命的文化和艺术的理论都发展到了登峰造极的地步，使它们进一步具有十分丰富的实际指导意义。
    帕迪利亚还指出，正当苏联修正主义领导集团在阉割马克思列宁主义、背叛革命并向美帝国主义屈膝投降的时候，“我们必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，把它插遍世界各地”。
    曾经访问过中国的墨西哥著名社会活动家凡妮·桑切斯·莫拉博士说，毛泽东思想在全世界正在产生越来越不可估量的影响，它是决定世界革命发展的一个因素。她说，中国人民依靠毛泽东思想缔造了今天的中国，世界各国人民有了毛泽东思想，将会取得一个光明的未来。
