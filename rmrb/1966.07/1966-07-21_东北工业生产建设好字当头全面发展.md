A new wave of studying Chairman Mao's works is promoting a new wave of production and construction. The Northeast's industrial production and construction, with "good" as the keyword, is achieving all-round development. In the first half of the year, the total industrial output value has completed more than half of the annual plan, and the production of major products has either completed or exceeded the national plan for the first half of the year. Key construction projects have been completed better than in previous years.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Shenyang on the 20th, the broad masses of workers on the industrial and transportation fronts in the Northeast have, in the surging waves of the Cultural Revolution, better studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, promoting the revolutionization of thought, and have achieved one victory after another in the struggle for production. The broad masses of workers have insisted on putting "good" first, seeking more, faster, and more economical results, driving the all-round leap in industrial production and construction in the region. In the first half of the year, the total industrial output value in the region has completed more than half of the annual plan, showing a significant increase compared to the same period last year. The production of major products has either completed or exceeded the national plan for the first half of the year. The production of steel, pig iron, steel products, electricity, timber, metal-cutting machine tools, and other products has increased significantly compared to the same period last year. The production of tractors and nitrogen fertilizer equipment has increased by more than 60%, and the production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has increased by more than 20%. The quality of the vast majority of products has been stabilized and improved, the variety of products has increased significantly, and costs have continued to decrease. The volume of railway freight has also increased significantly. The key construction projects have been completed better than in previous years. In particular, the mining industry, which is the foundation of the foundation industries, has completed its production and construction tasks for the first half of the year quite outstandingly, providing a reliable material foundation for the sustained development of the new wave of production and construction. The total coal production in the region has exceeded the national plan by more than 100 million tons, and the tunneling and stripping plans have also been exceeded.

The great situation on the industrial and transportation fronts in the Northeast is the result of the broad masses of workers emphasizing politics and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. It is a great victory of running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought.

This year, the industrial and transportation fronts in the Northeast have carried out a mass campaign to emphasize politics. In this great debate, many enterprises have thoroughly criticized and established three major issues: criticizing the neglect of politics and the purely technical view of production, establishing the idea of politics leading technology and business, and politics leading everything; criticizing the reliance on material incentives and purely relying on regulations and systems of capitalist thought, establishing the idea of politics in command and the primacy of human factors; criticizing the superstition of "experts" and "authorities" and the idea of running enterprises coldly and quietly relying on a few people, establishing the idea of believing in the masses and relying on the masses to run enterprises. Through this great debate, enterprise cadres and the masses of workers have rectified the relationship between politics leading production, politics leading technology, and politics leading business, strengthened their class and class struggle consciousness, and have become more determined to run socialist enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company, after two months of debate on emphasizing politics, has further clarified the great significance of emphasizing politics, has vigorously promoted the "four firsts" and the "three-eighths" spirit, promoted the revolutionization of people's thoughts and enterprises, and has powerfully promoted the development of the production and construction upsurge. In the first half of the year, Anshan's production of steel, pig iron, steel products, and other major products has increased significantly compared to the same period last year. In the first half of the year, the number of new varieties of steel products successfully developed has exceeded the total for the whole of last year.

Since this year, the broad masses of workers in the entire Northeast region have had an unprecedentedly high awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works. A new wave of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, where everyone reads Chairman Mao's books, listens to Chairman Mao's words, and acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions, is surging forward. The number of workers participating in the study of Chairman Mao's works has never been as extensive as it is now; the number of people who actively study and apply, especially those who focus on the "use" aspect, has never been as high as it is now. More and more workers, based on the serious study of Chairman Mao's quotations and the "Three Constantly Read Articles," are actively studying Chairman Mao's "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and other philosophical works, using Mao Zedong's philosophical thoughts to solve practical problems in production struggles and technological revolutions. In the past, some enterprise leaders thought that studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" was a matter for the general masses of workers. Now they have changed their views and have begun to seriously study the "Three Constantly Read Articles," consciously using the spirit of White and Zhang, comparing and examining themselves, eliminating selfishness and impurities, and seriously transforming their worldviews.

Since this year, the broad masses of workers in the Northeast region have taken the new industrial area of Jinzhou, modeled after Daqing, and the "Iron Man" of Daqing as examples, carrying forward the hard-boned spirit of the working class, daring to think, daring to do, daring to pioneer, and daring to innovate, vigorously developing new products and new technologies, and achieving new victories. Many enterprises in Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, and other cities have insisted on the policy of self-reliance, using local methods to start up, carrying forward the spirit of "poor sticks," working hard and cleverly, and have successfully developed more than 2,000 new products in just the first half of the year, with nearly 500 already in production or in small-scale production. Some of these products, such as stepless speed motors and electronic frequency accumulators, have a very high level.

At present, the broad masses of workers on the industrial and transportation fronts in the Northeast are continuing to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, denouncing and attacking the anti-party and anti-socialist black gangs with both words and writing, sweeping away all ghosts and demons; at the same time, with a heart full of anger towards the class enemy, they are treating the workshop as a battlefield and the machine as a weapon, determined to produce more and better products, ensuring victory on both the fronts of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and production and construction.

    学习毛主席著作新高潮促进生产建设新高潮
    东北工业生产建设好字当头全面发展
    上半年工业总产值完成全年计划一半以上，主要产品产量完成或超额完成了上半年国家计划，重点基本建设项目完成得比历年都好。
    据新华社沈阳二十日电  东北工业交通战线广大职工，在汹涌澎湃的文化大革命中更好地活学活用毛主席著作，促进思想革命化，在生产斗争中夺取了一个又一个新胜利。
    广大职工坚持好字当头，好中求多、求快、求省，推动了全区工业生产建设的全面跃进。上半年全区工业总产值完成了全年计划的一半以上，与去年同期相比，有较大幅度的增长。主要产品产量也完成或超额完成了上半年的国家计划。钢、生铁、钢材、电力、木材、金属切削机床等产品都比去年同期增长很多。拖拉机、氮肥设备增长百分之六十以上，化肥、农药增长百分之二十以上。绝大部分产品的质量稳定提高，产品品种大幅度增长，成本继续降低。铁路货运量也相应地有很大增长。基本建设的重点项目，完成得比历年都好。特别是作为基础工业基础的矿山工业，上半年生产建设任务完成得比较出色，为生产建设新高潮的持续发展提供了可靠的物质基础。全区原煤产量超额一百多万吨完成了国家计划，掘进、剥离计划也都超额完成了。
    东北工业交通战线出现的大好形势，是广大职工突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作的结果，是照毛泽东思想办企业的伟大胜利。
    东北工交战线职工今年开展了群众性的突出政治大辩论。在这场大辩论中，许多企业大破大立，集中地解决了三个问题：破忽视政治和单纯生产技术观点，立政治统帅技术业务，政治统帅一切的思想；破依靠物质刺激，单纯依靠规章制度的资本主义思想，立政治挂帅，人的因素第一的思想；破迷信“专家”、“权威”和靠少数人冷冷清清办企业的思想，立相信群众依靠群众办企业的思想。通过这次大辩论，企业干部和职工群众摆正了政治统帅生产、政治统帅技术、政治统帅业务的关系，增强了阶级和阶级斗争的观念，更加坚定地按照毛泽东思想来办好社会主义企业。鞍山钢铁公司，经过两个月的突出政治大辩论，广大职工进一步明确了突出政治的重大意义，大抓了四个第一，大树三八作风，促进了人的思想革命化和企业革命化，有力地推动了生产建设高潮的发展。上半年鞍钢的钢、生铁、钢材等几个主要产品产量都比去年同期有很大增长，半年来试制成功的新品种钢材比去年全年还多。
    今年以来，东北全区广大职工学习毛主席著作的自觉性空前高涨。一个人人读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事的活学活用毛主席著作新高潮正在蓬勃发展。参加学习毛主席著作的职工群众，从来没有象现在这样广泛；活学活用，特别是在“用”字上狠下功夫的人从来没有象现在这样多。越来越多的职工群众，在认真学习毛主席语录和“老三篇”的基础上，积极学习毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》等哲学著作，用毛主席的哲学思想来解决生产斗争、技术革命中的实际问题。过去有些企业领导干部认为学习“老三篇”是一般职工群众的事。现在他们改变了看法，开始认真学习“老三篇”，自觉地用白求恩、张思德的精神，对照检查自己，消除私心杂念，认真改造自己的世界观。
    东北地区的广大职工今年以来还以大庆式的新兴工业地区——锦州市为样板，以大庆“铁人”为标兵，发扬工人阶级的硬骨头精神，敢想敢干，敢闯敢创，大力发展新产品、新技术，取得了新的战果。沈阳、哈尔滨、长春等市的许多企业，坚持自力更生的方针，土法上马，发扬“穷棒子”精神，苦干、巧干，仅上半年就接连试制成功了新产品两千多种，已投产或小批投产的近五百种，其中有些产品如无级变速电机、电子频率积算器等都有很高的水平。
    目前，东北工业交通战线的广大职工正在继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一面口诛笔伐，向反党反社会主义的黑帮开火，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神；一面怀着对阶级敌人的满腔怒火，把车间当战场，把机器当刀枪，决心生产出更多更好的产品，保证在无产阶级文化大革命和生产建设两条战线上都打漂亮仗。
