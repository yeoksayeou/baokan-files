	In the plenary session of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, Mali representative Gologo said today that Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon of contemporary revolution, illuminating the broad revolutionary path for the peoples of the world.

	Gologo said in his speech at the meeting that the Mali delegation expresses its respect and admiration for the great revolutionary people of the People's Republic of China and its deserved leader. He praised China as the vanguard of the world's anti-imperialist struggle, a great nation that is worthy of the international proletariat. We are happy to say that the relations between the People's Republic of China and Mali are based on sincere friendship, selfless and active unity, and mutual trust.

	Gologo emphasized that the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people is also our struggle, and the severe trials they endure are also trials for us. The people of Mali are very clear that supporting the Vietnamese people is supporting ourselves, and supporting all the peoples of Asia and Africa.

	He said, for all the people of Mali, in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Korea, Indonesia, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea, the Canary Islands, the Congo, Ghana, and Latin America, those brothers who have fallen under the imperialist gunfire are freedom fighters defending our cause. They did not die in vain, because we will achieve liberation tomorrow. Imperialism is bound to lose in this struggle, and we will surely achieve the final victory.

	In discussing the revolutionary role of contemporary Asian and African writers, Gologo said that Asian and African writers must be warriors who wield both the gun and the pen, and must resolutely oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism.

	He said, the Mali delegation opposes and condemns the Cairo split meeting, and appeals to the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers to make the resolutions and suggestions produced by this conference further solidify the Asian and African writers' front.

    在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上  马里代表戈洛戈的发言
    新华社一日讯　马里代表戈洛戈今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，毛泽东思想是当代革命的灯塔，它照亮了世界人民广阔的革命道路。
    戈洛戈在会上发言时说，马里代表团向中华人民共和国伟大的革命人民的当之无愧的领导人表示敬意和钦佩。他赞扬中国是世界反帝斗争的前哨，是无愧于国际无产阶级的伟大国家。我们在这里高兴地说，中华人民共和国和马里的关系是建立在诚挚的友谊、无私积极的团结和互相信任的基础之上的。
    戈洛戈强调说，越南人民的英勇斗争，也就是我们的斗争，他们所经受的严峻考验，也是对我们的考验。马里人民很清楚，支持了越南人民也就等于支持了自己，等于支持了所有的亚非人民。
    他说，对所有的马里人民来说，在越南、老挝、柬埔寨、朝鲜、印度尼西亚、安哥拉、莫三鼻给、几内亚、加那利群岛、刚果、加纳和拉丁美洲，那些倒在帝国主义枪林弹雨下的兄弟，都是保卫我们事业的自由战士。他们不是白白地牺牲了，因为我们明天就将获得解放。帝国主义在这一战斗中是输定了，我们必将获得最后的胜利。
    在谈到当代亚非作家的革命作用时，戈洛戈说，亚非作家必须成为同时运用他的枪杆子和笔杆子的战士，必须坚决反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义。
    他说，马里代表团反对和谴责开罗分裂会议，并向亚非作家紧急会议呼吁，使这次会议产生的决议和建议能进一步彻底地巩固亚非作家的阵线。
