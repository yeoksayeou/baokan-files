In the midst of the Sato government in Japan becoming increasingly blatant as a henchman for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and anti-China activities, the Soviet revisionist leadership sent its Foreign Minister Gromyko as an official guest of the Japanese government to visit Japan.

Gromyko arrived in Tokyo on the evening of the 24th aboard a Soviet special aircraft. His statement at Haneda Airport revealed that the Soviet revisionist leadership is eagerly tightening its collusion with the Japanese Sato government to jointly serve the U.S. imperialist "bombing for peace" conspiracy. Gromyko said in his statement that the purpose of his visit to Japan is "to exchange views with Japanese politicians on issues of common concern." In his statement, he did not condemn U.S. imperialism's bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's Hanoi and Haiphong, nor did he support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. Instead, he vaguely said that "the current international situation cannot be said to be normal," and "in some regions, it is dangerous." He emphasized that he would discuss these "important international issues" with Japanese politicians during their talks. The *Tokyo Shinbun* reported that Gromyko's statement "suggested that the Soviet side would take an active attitude in discussing the Vietnam issue with the Japanese government."

Gromyko also lavishly praised Japan, under the rule of U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, as a "beautiful country," and expressed "satisfaction" with the development of Japan-Soviet collusion over the past few years as an extension of U.S.-Soviet collusion. He also stressed that "if both sides are willing, there is still room for further improvement in Japan-Soviet relations."

This is the first time a Soviet foreign minister has visited Japan in the history of Japan-Soviet diplomacy. As soon as Gromyko stepped off the plane, he proactively went forward to shake hands warmly with Japanese Foreign Minister Shigenobu Shidehara. After reading his statement, he again, in a fawning manner, requested to shake hands with Shidehara "like old friends," fully exposing the Soviet leadership's deliberate collusion with Japanese reactionaries.

    葛罗米柯到日本干什么？
    苏日加紧勾结为美帝“和谈”阴谋效劳
    据新华社东京二十五日电　在日本佐藤政府日益露骨地成为美帝侵略越南和反华的干将的时候，苏联修正主义领导集团派出它的外交部长葛罗米柯作为日本政府“正式客人”到日本进行“访问”。
    葛罗米柯在二十四日晚乘苏联专机到达东京。他在羽田机场发表的声明表明，苏联修正主义领导集团正在极力加紧同日本佐藤政府进行勾结，共同来为美帝国主义的“以炸迫和”阴谋效劳。葛罗米柯在声明中说，他访问日本的目的“是同日本政治家就当前共同关心的问题交换意见”。他在声明中不谴责美帝国主义轰炸越南民主共和国的河内和海防的扩大侵越战争的罪行，不支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，而是不分是非地说什么“当前的国际形势，不能说是正常的”，
  “在有的地区是危险的”。他强调他要就这种“重要的国际问题，同日本的政治家在会谈中加以磋商”。《东京新闻》的报道指出，葛罗米柯的这个声明“暗示了苏联方面将以积极的态度与日本政府商谈有关越南问题”。
    葛罗米柯在声明中还大肆颂扬在美日反动派统治下的日本是一个“美好的国家”，并且对过去几年来作为美苏勾结的延长的日苏勾结的发展，表示“满意”。他还强调说，“如果
  （日苏）双方愿意的话，日苏关系还有进一步改善的可能”。
    苏联外交部长访问日本，这在日苏外交史上是第一次。葛罗米柯一下飞机，就主动地走上前去同日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎亲热地握手。他在宣读了他的声明之后，又“象老朋友一样”再次献媚地要求同椎名握手，充分暴露出苏联领导集团蓄意勾结日本反动派的丑态。
