Ten thousand people from various circles in the capital held a grand rally in the Great Hall of the People this morning to denounce in anger the heinous crimes of the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong and their escalation of the war of aggression against Vietnam. The meeting once again solemnly declared to the world: No matter how far the U.S. imperialists escalate the war, and no matter what risks and sacrifices they are willing to take, the 700 million Chinese people will definitely carry out the struggle to aid Vietnam and resist the U.S. to the end, until the Vietnamese people achieve final victory.

Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Tao Zhu, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Yang Mingxuan, Peng Dehuai, Lin Feng, Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gao Zongmin and Xu Deheng, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Fu Zuoyi, President of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association Yang Xiuqing, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Zhang Zongxun, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Bingnan attended the meeting.

Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier Chen Yi delivered a speech at the meeting (full text on page two). He pointed out that since the U.S. imperialists have broken the boundaries of their aggressive war and pushed the war in Vietnam to a new stage, they cannot expect all anti-aggression countries and peoples to be constrained in their actions. The Chinese people will not allow the U.S. imperialists to continue their wanton acts.

Ambassador Chen Ziping of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China Chen Wencheng, Secretary-General of the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers Manuvila, and representatives of the Chinese democratic parties, non-partisan democrats, and people's organizations also spoke at the meeting.

Guests invited to the meeting included the Head of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic delegation to the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers, Chuong Truong, and the Head of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam delegation, Tran Dinh Dung, Deputy Head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China Nguyen Minh Phuong, and other Vietnamese comrades in Beijing.

Friends from Asia, Africa, Latin America, Oceania, Europe, and the United States who are in Beijing also attended the meeting. Among them were: General Secretary of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association Qia Huaduo, Japanese individuals Saji Kazuyoshi, Saionji Kuniichi, and Nakajima Kenzo, Indonesian individual Willy Halim, Lao individual Mrs. Koun Neng Bunseang, Head of the Malayan National Liberation League delegation to China Sharmah, Representative of the Patriotic Front of Thailand abroad Paron Chularat, Head of the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Beijing Galub, New Zealander Rewi Alley, Americans Strong, Coverland, and Aitken, representatives from member countries of the Afro-Asian Writers Permanent Bureau Cameroon, China, Ghana, Indonesia, India, Japan, Sudan, and Ceylon, and representatives from various countries and regions attending the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers.

The solemn Great Hall of the People was filled today with a strong atmosphere of solidarity and struggle between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples. Large banners hung in the meeting hall read: "People of the world, unite! Resolutely smash the U.S. imperialists' mad war of adventure!" and "The Vietnamese people will win, the U.S. imperialists will lose!"

The meeting was presided over by Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity Guo Moruo. After Guo Moruo delivered the opening speech (full text on page two), Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke first at the meeting.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech that the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong further broke the boundaries of the war and completely tore up the Geneva Agreement. Under these circumstances, it is entirely justified and reasonable for the people of North Vietnam to support the people of South Vietnam in any way and on any scale. He said that the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong not only gave the people of North and South Vietnam the right to support each other, but also gave the people of the world the right to support the Vietnamese people's struggle for national salvation against the U.S.

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' action of expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam once again proved that the U.S. imperialists' nature of aggression will not change. For such a cunning and treacherous enemy, one cannot harbor any unrealistic illusions but must engage in a tit-for-tat struggle with it.

Vice Premier Chen Yi condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for playing a shameful role as accomplices in the U.S. imperialists' plot of "bombing to force peace." He said that the Soviet leadership has always colluded with the U.S. imperialists on the Vietnamese issue, serving Johnson's peace plot, and attempting to bring the Vietnamese issue into the track of U.S.-Soviet cooperation. They are now intensifying their joint actions with the U.S. imperialists, sabotaging the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. Therefore, all countries that truly oppose U.S. imperialist aggression must also oppose the treacherous actions of Soviet revisionism and draw a clear line with their "joint actions" that betray the interests of the Vietnamese people and the world's revolutionary peoples.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Chinese people have always unreservedly supported the Vietnamese people's struggle for national salvation against the U.S. in every way. Now that the U.S. imperialists have pushed the war of aggression against Vietnam to a new stage, the Chinese people will not allow the U.S. imperialists to continue their wanton acts.

Ambassador Chen Ziping of Vietnam strongly condemned the new heinous crimes committed by the U.S. imperialists against the Vietnamese people. He said that the U.S. imperialists attempted to shake the will of the Vietnamese people through savage and adventurous acts of aggression, but they were met with a fierce counterattack in the face of the iron will of the heroic people of Hanoi, Haiphong, and the entire Vietnamese nation.

Chen Ziping pointed out that the U.S. imperialists attempted to use force to blackmail the Vietnamese people into surrender, but this desperate struggle is in vain. He said that the Vietnamese people are determined to fight to the end until there is not a single U.S. aggressor left on their soil.

He exposed the Johnson administration's efforts to play the "peace talks" trick, attempting to cover up its plan to escalate the war of aggression and deceive the American people and world public opinion. He pointed out that the U.S. imperialists, no matter when and how they act, cannot make the Vietnamese people surrender. The Vietnamese people are determined to continue fighting to the end and achieve final victory.

Chen Ziping said that the only way to solve the Vietnamese issue is through the path indicated by the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The U.S. government must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and all other acts of war, stop the war of aggression against South Vietnam, withdraw all U.S. and puppet troops and weapons from South Vietnam, and let the people of South Vietnam resolve their internal affairs themselves. There is no other way.

Ambassador Chen Ziping said that the statement issued by the Chinese government on July 3 is a great encouragement to the 700 million Chinese people for the Vietnamese people's struggle for national salvation against the U.S. and a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists' plot to strengthen aggression and escalate the war.

Head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China Chen Wencheng said in his speech (full text on page three) that the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong not only did not threaten the Vietnamese people but also reflected the desperate military and political situation of the U.S. and its lackeys in South Vietnam.

He said that the glorious victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam are of immense significance, proving that the people's war in South Vietnam is invincible and can completely defeat the so-called strongest and most modernized U.S. expeditionary forces in South Vietnam.

Chen Wencheng condemned the U.S. authorities for playing the so-called "peace," "unconditional talks," and other shameless plots while escalating the war in Vietnam. He emphasized that all plots and threats of intimidation will not make the Vietnamese nation surrender. The people of South Vietnam are determined to fight to the end, defeat the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, and achieve their sacred wish: independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and the reunification of the motherland.

Chen Wencheng pointed out that the Chinese people have given the Vietnamese people the most resolute, strongest, and most effective support. This great support, along with the support of other brotherly countries, has greatly enhanced the fighting potential of the people of South Vietnam and brought them great encouragement.

We, the people of South Vietnam, firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the only true representative of the people of South Vietnam—the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, with the united support of all our brothers and sisters in the North, the support of the Chinese people, and the sympathy and support of the people of the world, the people of South Vietnam, who are united and determined to fight, will definitely achieve final victory.

Secretary-General of the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers Manuvila introduced the situation of the Emergency Conference of Afro-Asian Writers expressing resolute support for the Vietnamese people's struggle for national salvation against the U.S. He said that the Afro-Asian writers will use their actual actions to tell the world who are the true friends of the Vietnamese people and who are the accomplices and conspirators of the U.S. imperialists who invade Vietnam.

Manuvila, when talking about the lie that China obstructs Soviet aid to Vietnam, said that the facts prove that the Soviet Union is the creator of this lie, thus also proving that the Soviet revisionists pretend to support the Vietnamese people but actually sabotage the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people.

He said that the sabotage plots of the Soviet revisionists will never succeed and will not save the fate of the U.S. imperialists' failure on Vietnamese soil.

Manuvila said that the Afro-Asian writers will never collude with those traitors of the people. They will use their pens to mercilessly expose and condemn the evil activities of the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices, the Soviet revisionist leadership. He said that the struggle of the Vietnamese people is a just cause, and they will definitely achieve final victory.

Following that, representatives of the Chinese democratic parties, non-partisan democrats, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity Zhang Jie, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Ma Chungu, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation Kang Keqing, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation Wang Zhaohua, and Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation Wu Shaozu, successively delivered speeches at the meeting. In their speeches, they angrily condemned the U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes of escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam and condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for acting as shameful accomplices in the U.S. imperialists' plot of "bombing to force peace." They unanimously expressed their support for the Chinese government's statement of July 3 and resolutely supported the Vietnamese brothers in driving the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam.

Yang Mingxuan said in his speech that the recent U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is a sign of their internal and external difficulties and desperation. The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists collude, attempting to "bomb to force peace," imposing a peace talks trick on the Vietnamese people, making the U.S. aggressors permanently occupy South Vietnam, and using South Vietnam as a base to invade North Vietnam, the entire Indochina, China, and the entire Asia. We must warn the U.S. imperialists that their acts of aggressive war will definitely suffer a shameful defeat.

Yang Mingxuan said that the Soviet revisionist leadership's active collusion with the U.S. imperialists this time, playing the big trick of "bombing to force peace," further exposed their traitorous faces, placing themselves in a position of hostility with the Vietnamese people, the Asian people, and all anti-imperialist, peace-loving people in the world. Therefore, while we engage in a tit-for-tat struggle with the U.S. imperialists, we must resolutely oppose the Soviet revisionist leadership.

Yang Mingxuan said that at present, the Chinese people are carrying out a magnificent proletarian cultural revolution under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, which is a top priority for the revolution of China and the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon for the Chinese people to defeat all domestic and foreign reactionaries. The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. We must unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, participate in the cultural revolution with the entire nation, strengthen self-reform, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and contribute all our strength to the revolution of China, the world, and especially to the current struggle to aid Vietnam and resist the U.S.

Zhang Jie said in his speech that Chairman Mao Zedong once pointed out: "U.S. imperialism is strong externally but weak internally. We must have a clear mind, which includes not believing the 'good words' of imperialism and not being afraid of imperialism's threats." The Chinese people, following Chairman Mao's wise teachings, have engaged in a tit-for-tat struggle with the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, finally achieving great revolutionary victories. He said that the U.S. imperialists' war blackmail and "peace talks" plots will not reverse their defeat in Vietnam but will only further ignite the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. fury and hasten their own doom.

Zhang Jie said that the Chinese people are willing to join the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all truly anti-imperialist revolutionary peoples in the world, to do their best and take all effective measures to support the Vietnamese people's struggle for national salvation against the U.S. and to fight to the end to defeat the U.S. imperialists.

Ma Chungu said in his speech that all Chinese workers, like the people of the entire nation, are resolutely supporting and implementing the Chinese government's statement of July 3 with practical actions. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry out the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution to the end, accelerate the pace of socialist revolution and construction in our country, and resolutely support our Vietnamese brothers to fight to the end, until we drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam completely and achieve final victory.

Ma Chungu said that China and Vietnam are the closest brotherly neighbors. We cannot stand by and watch the U.S. aggressors massacre our Vietnamese brothers. The Chinese working class and people armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought will steadfastly support our Vietnamese brothers, take all necessary actions based on the interests and requirements of the Vietnamese people, and together with our Vietnamese brothers, resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate the U.S. imperialists.

Kang Keqing said in her speech that the Vietnamese people have created a great situation. They have fully realized from their own experience that the U.S. imperialists, who appear strong, are merely paper tigers. No matter whether they use the methods of bombing or playing the "peace" deception trick, the Vietnamese people and women will only give them a fierce response: fight them to the end until they are completely annihilated. The fate of the U.S. imperialists has already been decided. They will definitely meet with failure, further failure, and eventually perish.

Kang Keqing said that the Chinese people and women, following the teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong: "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," we dare to shoulder heavy responsibilities and dare to take any risks. We will definitely, together with the Vietnamese people and the people of the world, resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate the U.S. imperialists.

Wang Zhaohua said in his speech that Chinese youth, under the guidance of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, have always regarded the Vietnamese people and youth's struggle for national salvation against the U.S. as a great support for us and regarded supporting the Vietnamese people and youth's struggle for national salvation against the U.S. as our internationalist duty. We have made all preparations, fearing neither hardship nor death. Once our country issues a call and once the Vietnamese people and youth make a request, we will immediately take up arms and fight shoulder to shoulder with the heroic Vietnamese brothers and sisters until we annihilate all the U.S. bandits without exception.

Wang Zhaohua said that the Chinese people and youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most thorough and steadfast revolutionaries and the most combat-ready. Chinese youth will, together with the people of the entire nation, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end. Chinese youth will forever be the closest brothers and most reliable comrades-in-arms of the Vietnamese youth.

Wu Shaozu said in his speech that the Soviet revisionist leadership is a traitor to the revolutionary peoples of the world and the number one accomplice of the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam. We cannot harbor any illusions about the Soviet revisionist leadership. To oppose the U.S. imperialists, we must resolutely oppose Soviet modern revisionism. He emphasized that Chinese students must strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought and apply Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought is our best weapon to aid Vietnam and resist the U.S.

The speeches at the meeting stirred up wave after wave of enthusiastic applause. After the speeches, the entire audience of ten thousand stood up and raised their arms, shouting: "Resolutely support the Vietnamese people's just struggle for national salvation against the U.S.!" "Salute to the heroic Vietnamese people!" "U.S. imperialists, get out of South Vietnam! Get out of Asia! Get out of Africa! Get out of Latin America! Get out of all the places you have occupied!"

Today's meeting was jointly organized by the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament and the China-Vietnam Friendship Association, among other thirteen people's organizations. Responsible persons from the Chinese people's organizations, democratic parties, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, as well as other relevant individuals, Zhang Sirou, Chu Tunan, Zhang Zhiren, Wang Shaohua, Ji Fang, Chen Qiyou, Hu Jiewen, Hu Ziyang, Xu Mengshan, Wang Kunlun, Shu Sheyu, Hu Chi, Zhou Peiyuan, and Awang Jiacuo, also attended the meeting.

    新华社十日讯　首都各界一万人，今天上午在人民大会堂隆重集会，愤怒声讨美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防和扩大侵越战争的滔天罪行。大会再一次庄严地向全世界宣告：不管美帝国主义把战争扩大到什么地步，也不管要冒多大的风险和付出多大的代价，七亿中国人民一定要把援越抗美斗争进行到底，直到越南人民取得最后胜利。
    国务院总理周恩来，副总理陈毅、陶铸，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若、杨明轩、程潜、林枫、刘宁一，政协全国委员会副主席高崇民、许德珩，国防委员会副主席傅作义，中越友协会长杨秀峰，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志，中国人民解放军副总参谋长张宗逊，外交部副部长王炳南等，出席了大会。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅在大会上发表了讲话（全文见第二版），他指出，美帝国主义既然打破了侵略战争的界限和把侵越战争推进到了一个新的阶段，它就不能指望一切反侵略的国家和人民在行动上再受任何约束，中国人民决不能听任美帝国主义继续胡作非为。
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使陈子平，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长陈文成，亚非作家紧急会议秘书长曼努维拉，以及我国民主党派、无党派民主人士和人民团体的代表，也在大会上讲了话。

    在北京的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、大洋洲、欧洲和美国的朋友出席了大会。他们当中有：亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多，日本人士砂间一良、西园寺公一、中岛健藏，印度尼西亚人士威利·哈利安查，老挝人士贵宁·奔舍那夫人，马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团团长沙尔玛，泰国爱国阵线驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖，巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处主任加尔布，新西兰人士艾黎，美国人士斯特朗、柯弗兰、爱德乐，亚非作家常设局成员国喀麦隆、中国、加纳、印度尼西亚、印度、日本、苏丹、锡兰的代表，以及出席亚非作家紧急会议的各国和地区的代表。
    庄严的人民大会堂里，今天充满了中越两国人民团结战斗的强烈气氛。大会会场上，悬挂着醒目的巨幅标语：“全世界人民团结起来，坚决粉碎美帝国主义疯狂的战争冒险！”“越南人民必胜，美帝国主义必败！”
    大会由人大常委会副委员长、中国和委会主席郭沫若主持。郭沫若致开会词（全文见第二版）以后，陈毅副总理首先在大会上讲话。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防的行动，进一步打破了战争的界限，彻底地撕毁了日内瓦协议。在这种情况下，越南北方人民不论用什么方式、在多大规模上支援越南南方人民，都是天经地义、理所当然的。他说，美帝国主义对河内和海防的轰炸不仅使越南南北两方人民进一步取得了相互支援的权利，同时也使全世界人民进一步取得了支援越南人民抗美救国斗争的权利。
    陈毅副总理指出，美国扩大侵略越南战争的行动再一次证明，美帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的。对于美帝国主义这样凶恶和狡猾的敌人，决不能抱有任何不切实际的幻想，而只能同它进行针锋相对的斗争。
    陈毅副总理谴责苏联修正主义领导集团在美帝国主义玩弄“以炸迫和”的阴谋中扮演了可耻的帮凶角色。他说，苏联领导集团一贯在越南问题上同美帝国主义勾勾搭搭，为约翰逊的和谈阴谋效劳，妄图把越南问题纳入美苏合作的轨道。他们正在变本加厉地同美帝国主义大搞“联合行动”，破坏世界各国人民的革命斗争。因此，一切真正反对美帝国主义侵略的国家，必须同时反对苏联修正主义的叛卖行为，必须同它出卖越南人民和世界人民革命利益的“联合行动”划清界限。
    陈毅副总理说，中国人民一贯无保留地从各方面支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争。现在，美帝国主义既然把侵略越南的战争推进到一个新的阶段，中国人民决不能听任美帝国主义继续胡作非为。
    越南驻中国大使陈子平在讲话（全文见第三版）中强烈谴责美帝国主义对越南人民犯下的新的滔天罪行。他说，美帝国主义企图用野蛮和冒险的侵略行动来动摇我国人民的斗志，但是在英雄的河内、海防军民和越南全国人民坚如钢铁的决战决胜的意志面前，它们遭到了迎头痛击。
    陈子平指出，美帝国主义企图使用武力讹诈的手段迫使越南人民屈服投降，这种绝望挣扎是枉费心机的。他说，越南人民决心战斗到底，直到在自己的国土上看不到一个美国侵略者的影子为止。
    他揭露约翰逊政府竭力玩弄“和谈”骗局，妄图掩盖它扩大侵略战争的计划，欺骗美国人民和世界舆论。他指出，美帝国主义不论任何时候采用任何方式都不能使越南人民屈服，越南人民决心继续打到最后胜利。
    陈子平说，解决越南问题的唯一途径，就是越南民主共和国政府四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线五点声明所指出的途径。美国政府必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动，停止对越南南方的侵略战争，必须把美国及其仆从的军队、武器全部撤出越南南方，由越南南方人民自己解决自己的内部事务。除此以外，没有任何其他途径。
    陈子平大使说，中国政府七月三日发表的声明是七亿中国人民对越南人民抗美救国事业的巨大鼓舞，是对美帝国主义阴谋加强侵略和扩大战争的沉重打击。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长陈文成在讲话（全文见第三版）中指出，美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防的罪行，不仅丝毫也威胁不了越南人民，相反地更加反映了美国及其走狗在越南南方面临着军事和政治上的山穷水尽的困境。
    他说，越南南方军民所取得的辉煌胜利具有无比重大的意义，它雄辩地表明越南南方人民战争是所向无敌的，完全能够打败在越南南方的号称资本主义世界最强大和最现代化的美国远征侵略军。
    陈文成谴责美国当局在扩大越南战争的同时正玩弄所谓“和平”、“无条件讨论”等无耻阴谋。他强调指出，一切阴谋诡计和一切威胁恫吓手段决不能使越南民族屈服，越南南方军民坚决战斗到底，打败美帝国主义及其走狗，一定实现自己的神圣愿望：独立、民主、和平、中立，进而统一祖国。
    陈文成指出，中国人民给予了越南人民最坚决、最强有力、最有效的支持，正是这种巨大的支持和其他兄弟国家人民的支持，大大地增强了越南南方人民战斗的潜力，并给越南南方人民带来了巨大的鼓舞。
    我们越南南方人民坚信，在越南南方人民唯一真正的代表——越南南方民族解放阵线的英明领导下，有全体北方骨肉同胞同心协力的支援，有中国人民以及世界各国人民的同情和支持，具有团结一致的坚决斗争精神的越南南方人民必将取得最后胜利。
    亚非作家紧急会议秘书长曼努维拉在讲话中，介绍了亚非作家紧急会议表示坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的情况。他说，亚非作家将用他们的实际行动告诉全世界人民，谁是越南人民真正的朋友，谁是侵略越南的美帝国主义的帮凶和同谋者。
    曼努维拉谈到所谓中国阻挠苏联援越物资过境的谎言时说，事实证明苏联是这个谎言的制造者，从而也证明苏联修正主义假支持越南人民，而在真破坏越南人民的英勇斗争。
    他说，苏联修正主义者的破坏阴谋永远不会得逞，也挽救不了美帝国主义在越南土地上失败的命运。
    曼努维拉说，亚非作家绝不与那些人民的叛徒同流合污。他们将用笔无情地揭露和谴责美帝国主义及其帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团的罪恶活动。他说，越南人民的斗争是正义的事业，他们必将取得最后的胜利。
    接着，我国各民主党派、无党派民主人士和全国工商联的代表杨明轩，中国亚非团结委员会副主席张杰，中华全国总工会副主席马纯古，全国妇联副主席康克清，全国青联副主席王照华，全国学联主席伍绍祖，相继在大会上发表讲话。他们在讲话中愤怒谴责美帝国主义扩大侵越战争的滔天罪行，谴责苏联修正主义领导集团在“以炸迫和”的阴谋中充当了美帝国主义的可耻帮凶。他们一致表示拥护我国政府七月三日的声明，坚决支援越南兄弟把美国侵略者从越南赶出去。
    杨明轩在讲话中说，美帝国主义最近轰炸河内、海防，是它内外交困走投无路，狗急跳墙的表现。美帝国主义与苏联修正主义同谋，妄图“以炸迫和”，把和谈骗局强加给越南人民，使美国侵略军永远占领越南南方，把越南南方作为它侵略越南北方、侵略整个印度支那、侵略中国、侵略整个亚洲的基地。我们要正告美帝国主义，你们这种侵略战争的行动，一定要遭到可耻的失败。
    杨明轩说，苏联修正主义领导集团这次积极配合美帝国主义，玩弄“以炸迫和”的大阴谋，这就更加暴露了它的叛徒嘴脸，把它自己置于同越南人民、亚洲人民和世界一切反帝、爱好和平人民敌对的地位。因此，我们在同美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争的同时，必须坚决反对苏联修正主义领导集团。
    杨明轩说，当前我国人民正在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下开展着一个波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命，这是关系我国革命和全世界革命前途的头等大事。毛泽东思想是中国人民战胜国内外一切反动派最锐利的武器。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是战无不胜的。我们一定要更加紧密地团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，和全国人民一道，在伟大的毛泽东思想红旗指引下，积极参加文化大革命，加强自我改造，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，为中国革命、世界革命，特别是在当前的援越抗美斗争中贡献一切力量。
    张杰在讲话中说，毛泽东主席曾经指出：“美国帝国主义是外强中干的。我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”中国人民遵循毛主席的英明教导，同美帝国主义及其走狗进行了针锋相对的斗争，终于取得了革命的伟大胜利。他说，美帝国主义的战争讹诈和“和谈”阴谋，都绝不能挽回它在越南的败局，只能更加激起越南人民的抗美怒火，加速它自己的覆灭。
    张杰说，中国人民愿同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民一道，同全世界一切真正反帝革命的人民一道，尽自己的一切可能，采取一切有效办法，为支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，为彻底打败美帝国主义而奋斗。
    马纯古在讲话中说，全中国工人和全国人民一样，正在以实际行动坚决拥护和贯彻我国政府七月三日的声明，我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗把已经轰轰烈烈开展起来的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，加速我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的步伐，全力以赴地坚决支持兄弟的越南人民打到底，直到把美国侵略者全部彻底赶出越南取得最后胜利。
    马纯古说，中国和越南是最亲密的兄弟邻邦，我们绝不能眼看着美国侵略者屠杀越南兄弟不管。用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级和人民将坚定不移地支持兄弟的越南人民，根据越南人民的利益和要求，随时采取一切我们认为必要的行动，同越南兄弟一起，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地歼灭美帝国主义。
    康克清在讲话中说，越南人民已经打出了一个大好形势，他们从自己的切身体会中，充分地认识到，美帝国主义这个貌似强大的敌人，不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎。不管它是采取打和炸的办法，还是耍“和平”欺骗的鬼花招，越南人民和妇女给它的回答只能是，狠狠地打，跟它打到底，直到把它完全彻底消灭。美帝国主义的下场早已经注定了，它必然是捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡。
    康克清说，中国人民和中国妇女遵照毛泽东主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我们敢于肩负重担，敢于冒任何风险。我们一定要和越南人民一起，和全世界人民一起，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭美帝国主义。
    王照华在讲话中说，中国青年在中国共产党和毛主席的教导下，一向把越南人民和青年的抗美救国斗争看作是对我们的巨大支持，把支援越南人民和青年的抗美救国斗争看作是自己应尽的国际主义义务。我们已经作好了一切准备，一不怕苦，二不怕死，一旦祖国发出号召，一旦越南人民和青年提出要求，我们就马上拿起武器，和英雄的越南兄弟姐妹们并肩战斗，不把美国强盗全部消灭，决不罢休。
    王照华说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和青年是最彻底、最坚定的革命者，是最有战斗力的。中国青年将同全国人民一道，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。中国青年将永远是越南青年最亲密的兄弟和最可靠的战友。
    伍绍祖在讲话中说，苏联修正主义领导集团是世界革命人民的无耻叛徒，是美帝国主义侵略越南的头号帮凶。我们对苏联修正主义领导集团不能存在任何幻想，要反对美帝国主义，就必须坚决反对苏联现代修正主义。他强调说，中国学生一定要努力学好毛泽东思想，活学活用毛主席著作。毛泽东思想是我们援越抗美的最好武器。
    大会上的所有讲话，在会场上激起了一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。讲话以后，全场万人起立，振臂高呼：“坚决支持越南人民抗美救国正义斗争！”“向英雄的越南人民致敬！”“美帝国主义从越南南方滚出去！从亚洲滚出去！从非洲滚出去！从拉丁美洲滚出去！从它侵占的一切地方滚出去！”
