Shanghai and Tianjin people strongly condemn the new crimes of U.S. imperialism. Our government's statement expresses the determination of 700 million Chinese people to aid Vietnam and resist U.S. aggression.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 6: The insane war actions of U.S. imperialism in bombing Hanoi and Haiphong in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have aroused the extreme anger of the people of Shanghai. In recent days, many factories, people's communes, and schools have held meetings to express their firm support for our government's statement of July 3 and to sternly warn U.S. imperialism: You have no limits in expanding the war of aggression in Vietnam, and we have no limits in aiding Vietnam and resisting U.S. aggression. No matter where you expand the war, no matter what the cost, we will unshakably support our Vietnamese brothers to the end, until the final victory.

Many workers held meetings in front of steel furnaces, by machine tools, and on docks. At a meeting in the second converter workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, veteran worker Sheng Chenghou said, "Our government's solemn statement represents the iron will of 700 million people to aid Vietnam and resist U.S. aggression. Vietnam is our neighboring country with whom we share a common fate. We cannot stand by and watch the American bandits carry out their insane and barbaric aggression against our Vietnamese brothers. We Shanghai steel workers firmly stand on the side of the Vietnamese people and are ready at any time to contribute our greatest strength to support our Vietnamese brothers."

At a meeting in Shanghai's Fifth Loading and Unloading Area, dock worker Cheng Guangming, who witnessed American warships fleeing the Huangpu River on the eve of liberation, said, "The American bandits look fierce, but they are actually paper tigers. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have used iron fists to defeat the Kuomintang bandits and driven out the American bandits. Today, this paper tiger is again rampaging on Vietnamese soil. We must smash it!"

In recent days, the broad masses of cadres and members of people's communes in the suburbs of Shanghai have closely followed the situation in Vietnam. While strongly condemning the new crimes of aggression by U.S. imperialism, they express great indignation towards the collusion of the Soviet revisionist leadership with U.S. imperialism in playing the big trick of "bombing for peace." Secretary of the Party Committee of Pengpu People's Commune, Sun Junping, said, "The Soviet revisionist leadership is the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. They are bombing from the air and pulling from the ground, both bombing and pulling to achieve the evil purpose of 'bombing for peace.' We must fight against them head-on!"

The broad masses of teachers and students at Fudan University, East China Normal University, and Tongji University are also extremely angry about the war crimes of U.S. imperialism in bombing Hanoi and Haiphong.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 6: The people of Tianjin strongly condemn the insane aggression and war crimes of U.S. imperialism in bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. They firmly declare that the Chinese people have made all preparations and will take all necessary actions at any time according to the interests and demands of the Vietnamese people to support our Vietnamese brothers in driving out the American aggressors from Vietnamese soil without leaving a single one.

Workers, traffic personnel, and militia on the industrial, transportation, and commercial fronts in Tianjin held meetings. Many workers, filled with indignation, severely denounced the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism. Zhang Shiming, a young worker at the Tianjin Wire Rope Factory, a model enterprise in the style of Daqing, said, "Our government's statement expresses our determination, boosts our morale, boosts the morale of the Vietnamese people, and boosts the morale of revolutionary people all over the world. What is infuriating is that the Soviet revisionist leadership colludes with U.S. imperialism to play the big trick of 'bombing for peace.' We must thoroughly expose the 'peace talks' trick of the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the Vietnam issue and firmly support the Vietnamese people in carrying out their just struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation to the end."

The broad masses of people's communes in the suburbs of Tianjin are deeply enraged by the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in Vietnam. Secretary of the Party Committee of Beizhaikou Commune, Wang Fengchun, said, "Our government and Premier Zhou Enlai have repeatedly solemnly declared that the Chinese people keep their word, China is prepared, and there will be no limits if the war breaks out."

Some colleges and universities in Tianjin also held meetings. Students in Class A, Year 2, Department of Electrochemistry, School of Chemical Engineering, Tianjin University, said, "The U.S. imperialism's bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong fully exposes its shameful trick of 'bombing for peace' and exposes the weak essence of its paper tiger. Under the strong support of the Chinese people and revolutionary people all over the world, the heroic Vietnamese people will surely achieve the final victory in their struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 6: The people of various circles in Shenyang strongly condemn the heinous war actions of U.S. imperialism in brazenly bombing the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Advanced figures on the industrial, commercial, and educational fronts in Shenyang held meetings. Wang Feng'en, a famous labor model and engineer from Shenyang Transformer Factory, said, "U.S. imperialism's brazen bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong has pushed the war of aggression to a new and serious stage, fully exposing its desperate situation of failure in the war of aggression and internal and external difficulties. Our government's solemn statement represents the firm will of 700 million Chinese people to aid Vietnam and resist U.S. aggression. Blood debts must be repaid with blood. Shenyang workers and people all over the country are ready to give our Vietnamese brothers the most resolute support without reservation at any time. Wang Fengying, a famous labor model and stamping worker from Northeast Machinery Manufacturing Plant, said, "U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam is an attempt to use Vietnam as a springboard to further invade China and Asia. We warn the U.S. aggressors: The Chinese people keep their word. As long as the U.S. aggressors do not roll out of Vietnam, we will never stop supporting the Vietnamese people. Li Suwen, a model in the national commercial system for studying Chairman Mao's works and deputy political instructor of Shenyang Peace Foodstuffs Store, said in indignation, "U.S. imperialism wants to bomb out a 'peace talk,' which is absolutely impossible. The Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialism are in cahoots, playing various tricks of 'peace talks' behind the scenes, which cannot deceive the Vietnamese people, nor can they deceive the Chinese people and revolutionary people all over the world."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 6: The insane war actions of U.S. imperialism in bombing Hanoi and Haiphong have aroused the extreme anger of the people of Chengdu. They express their firm support for our government's statement of July 3 and are ready to take all necessary actions at any time according to the interests and demands of the Vietnamese people to support our Vietnamese brothers until they drive out U.S. imperialism completely and thoroughly from Vietnam and achieve the final victory.

Fang Guangrong, an advanced worker in the Southwest Region and a model worker in Chengdu, said, "We will support the Vietnamese people with the greatest resolve according to their interests and demands, no matter the cost. He also angrily denounced the Soviet revisionist leadership and U.S. imperialism for wearing the same pants and playing the big trick of 'bombing for peace,' betraying the Vietnamese people.

The farmers in the suburbs of Chengdu firmly declare that they will spare no effort to support our Vietnamese brothers.

Students at Sichuan Medical College said, "The youth of the Mao Zedong era will spare no effort and fear no sacrifice to oppose the aggression of U.S. imperialism." Students from more than 20 ethnic groups, including Tibetans, Yi, and Qiang, at Southwest Nationalities Institute held meetings. Li Guoguo, a representative of the National People's Congress and a Yi student, said, "We must be prepared in all aspects and do everything possible to support our Vietnamese brothers."

    许多工人在炼钢炉前、在机床旁、码头上举行了集会。上海第一钢铁厂第二转炉车间老工人盛承厚在一次集会上说，我国政府的严正声明代表了我们七亿人民援越抗美的钢铁意志。越南是我们唇齿相依的邻邦，我们决不能坐视美国强盗对越南兄弟进行疯狂的、野蛮的侵略。我们上海钢铁工人坚决站在越南人民一边，随时准备着为支援兄弟的越南人民贡献最大的力量。
    在上海第五装卸区举行的集会上，解放前夕曾目睹美国军舰从黄浦江狼狈逃走的码头工人程光明说，美国强盗看样子很凶，其实是纸糊的老虎。中国人民在共产党和毛主席的领导下，用铁拳打垮了蒋匪军，赶走了美国强盗。今天，这只纸老虎又在越南土地上张牙舞爪，我们一定要把它打烂！
    这些天来，上海郊区人民公社的广大干部和社员，密切注视着越南的局势。人们在愤怒谴责美帝国主义新的侵略罪行的同时，对苏联修正主义领导集团勾结美帝国主义玩弄“以炸迫和”的大阴谋表示极大的愤慨。彭浦人民公社党委书记孙君平说：“苏联修正主义领导集团是美帝国主义的头号帮凶。他们是一个在空中炸，一个在地上拉，一炸一拉都是为了实现‘以炸迫和’的罪恶目的。我们就是要同它作针锋相对的斗争！”
    复旦大学、华东师范大学、交通大学等学校的广大师生，对美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防的战争罪行也极为愤怒。
    据新华社天津六日电  天津人民强烈谴责美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防的疯狂的侵略和战争罪行。他们坚定地表示，中国人民已经做好一切准备，将随时根据越南人民的利益和要求，采取一切必要的行动，支援兄弟的越南人民把美国侵略者从越南的土地上一个不留地赶出去。
