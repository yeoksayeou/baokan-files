For over a decade, Zhou Yang has been implementing a counter-revolutionary, anti-socialist revisionist line in the field of opera. He has consistently distorted and attacked Chairman Mao's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," suppressing revolutionary modern plays and opposing the transformation of feudal and capitalist old forms into socialist new ones. At every critical moment of opera reform, he has used the pretext of "diversification" and "meeting the needs of various audiences" to vigorously defend feudal and capitalist elements, turning opera into a tool against the Party and socialism.

In 1952, the Ministry of Culture held the first national opera performance, featuring modern-themed plays such as "Little Son-in-Law," "Rohan Money," "Female Teacher," and "New Deeds in New Ways." These were the initial achievements of opera serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers after the founding of the nation and should have been vigorously promoted. However, Zhou Yang criticized these modern plays in his summary of the performance, claiming they were not "realistic" and violated the "highest principles of art." He further stipulated: "For those themes that are currently not suitable for depicting modern life but are only suitable for depicting history and folklore, we should not force them to immediately depict modern life, lest it damage their inherent advantages and characteristics." With this rope, he tied the hands of opera workers, preventing them from creating revolutionary modern plays, openly opposing Chairman Mao's literary thoughts. Chairman Mao said in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "We do not reject the use of artistic forms from past eras, but these old forms, once in our hands, are transformed by us, infused with new content, and thus become revolutionary and serve the people." Everyone knows that the Beijing opera "Red Lantern," beloved by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, was created by breaking away from the original Beijing opera form and developing and innovating it into a revolutionary modern play. It was precisely due to Zhou Yang's suppression that the national opera community did not produce any good revolutionary modern plays for a long time. On the contrary, some opera genres that were good at depicting modern life, such as Shanghai opera, Pingju, and Quju, all performed a lot of romantic dramas.

In 1958, under the inspiration of the Great Leap Forward, a wave of performing revolutionary modern plays swept the nation. At this time, Zhou Yang dared not openly oppose it, so he played a trick by proposing at the Modern Opera Symposium held by the Ministry of Culture in July of that year the policy of "promoting opera to reflect modern life on the one hand, and respecting tradition on the other; encouraging the creation of new plays on the one hand, and continuing to sort out and adapt old plays on the other," known as the "two-pronged approach." This was to fight for the position of feudal traditional opera themes, once again suppressing the wave of performing revolutionary modern plays.

In April 1960, the opera community, based on the anti-rightist and enthusiastic spirit of 1959, launched another leap forward, performing revolutionary modern plays. At that time, the Ministry of Culture, under the pressure of the situation, held a small-scale modern opera performance. Originally, this performance should have been a strong advocacy for revolutionary modern plays, but Zhou Yang and his gang once again developed the "two-pronged approach" proposed in 1958 into the policy of "three in one" for modern plays, newly adapted historical plays, and traditional plays. Their purpose was to use new historical plays and traditional plays to once again squeeze out revolutionary modern plays. Zhou Yang and his gang's so-called "three in one" was actually a mix of feudal and capitalist goods. Therefore, after this performance, modern plays became fewer and fewer. By the end of 1962, according to statistics of the performances of 26 key opera troupes nationwide, modern plays accounted for only one-thousandth of all performances, almost all squeezed out.

It is particularly worth noting that in September 1962, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued the great call to "never forget class struggle," and Chairman Mao also criticized a series of directional errors in cultural work. However, Zhou Yang adopted a resistant attitude towards Chairman Mao's criticisms. In September 1963, at the Beijing Opera Work Symposium held by the Propaganda Department, he said: "We cannot just perform modern plays and not perform historical and traditional plays." At the same time, the Ministry of Culture promoted 60 traditional plays nationwide, including "Stubborn Official," "Reunion After Separation," and "Striking the Golden Branch," which praised emperors, generals, and romantic heroes, as so-called "model plays," with 42 of them being bad plays.

Zhou Yang's hostility towards revolutionary modern plays is aimed at opposing opera from depicting the struggles of socialist revolution and socialist construction; opposing the heroes of the socialist era of workers, peasants, and soldiers from becoming the masters of the stage.

Zhou Yang's opposition to revolutionary modern plays also naturally makes him regard traditional plays of the feudal era as treasures. In this regard, he vigorously advocates the policy of comprehensive inheritance.

Regarding the issue of how to deal with ancient cultural heritage, Chairman Mao taught us in "On New Democracy": "...cleaning up the development process of ancient culture, removing its feudal dross, and absorbing its democratic essence is a necessary condition for developing national new culture and enhancing national self-confidence; but we must not indiscriminately accept everything. We must distinguish between the rotten things of the ancient feudal ruling class and the excellent people's culture of ancient times, which is more or less democratic and revolutionary."

In this regard, Zhou Yang is vigorously opposed to Chairman Mao's instructions.

From the first national opera performance in 1952 to the first national opera script work conference held by the Ministry of Culture in 1956, Zhou Yang, in his two speeches, proposed a revisionist fallacy of so-called "popularity" in the specific policy of opera script work, which is contrary to Mao Zedong Thought. This so-called "popularity" can be summarized into three points: First, the exploiting class also has so-called "good people." He said: "There can be commonalities between the ruling class and the people." He believes that "feudal morality also has popularity." He absurdly claims that "feudal political philosophy, ethics, the way of rulers, subjects, fathers, and sons, etc., have commonalities with today." Isn't this blatantly whitewashing the exploiting class? Under the influence of his fallacy, a large number of emperors and generals firmly remain on the opera stage. Second, he advocates bourgeois love above all else. He said: "The Butterfly Lovers and The Legend of the White Snake... can almost be said to have love conquering death." Under the guidance of this revisionist thought, all kinds of romantic heroes flooded the stage. Third, he promotes feudal superstition. He advocates that "those who do not submit to the fate of ghosts and gods, such as Li Huimang and Qiu Guying, these ghosts on the stage, should be affirmed and promoted." This fallacy became the protective charm for a large number of ghost plays on the stage later.

From this, it can be seen that Zhou Yang's advocacy of "popularity" is to make a large number of emperors, generals, romantic heroes, and demons and ghosts long occupy the opera stage, replacing socialist new operas, spreading poison to the people, and preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

　　不准周扬压制革命现代戏
　　——选自文化部艺术局的大字报
    十几年来，周扬在戏曲工作上，执行了一条反党反社会主义的修正主义黑线。他百般歪曲和攻击毛主席提出的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，一贯压制革命的现代戏，反对戏曲推封建主义、资本主义之陈，出社会主义之新。每当戏曲革命的关键时刻，他都在所谓“多样化”和适应观众“各方面的需要”的幌子下，竭力维护封建主义、资本主义的东西，把戏曲变成反党反社会主义的工具。
    一九五二年，文化部举行第一届全国戏曲会演，演出了《小女婿》《罗汉钱》《女教师》《新事新办》等现代题材剧目。这是建国初期戏曲艺术为工农兵服务的初步成果，理应大加扶植。但是，周扬在会演的总结中，却攻击这些现代戏不“真实”，违反了“艺术的最高原则”。他并且进一步规定：“凡目前尚不适合于表现现代生活，而只适合于表现历史和民间传说的题材的，就不要强求它立刻表现现代生活，以致损害它固有的优点和特色。”他用这样一条绳索，捆住戏曲工作者大搞革命现代戏的手脚，公开同毛主席的文艺思想唱反调。毛主席在《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中说：“对于过去时代的文艺形式，我们也并不拒绝利用，但这些旧形式到了我们手里，给了改造，加进了新内容，也就变成革命的为人民服务的东西了。”大家知道，为广大工农兵观众所热爱的京剧《红灯记》，不就是打破了原来的京剧形式，而又加以发展和创造，才成为革命的现代戏的吗？正是由于周扬的压制，全国戏曲界在很长的时间内没有产生好的革命现代戏。相反，一些善于表现现代生活的剧种，例如沪剧、评剧、曲剧等等，都大演起才子佳人戏了。
    一九五八年，在大跃进的形势鼓舞下，全国兴起了大演革命现代戏的热潮。这时，周扬不敢公开反对，于是耍了一个花招，在当年七月文化部召开的现代戏曲座谈会上，提出“一方面提倡戏曲反映现代生活，一方面重视传统；一方面鼓励创造新剧目，一方面继续整理、改编旧有剧目”的“双管齐下”方针，为封建的传统戏曲剧目争地位，再一次把大演革命现代戏的热潮压了下去。
    一九六○年四月，当时戏曲界在一九五九年反右倾、鼓干劲的基础上，又来了一个跃进，大演革命现代戏。当时的文化部为形势所迫，举行了小型现代戏曲会演。本来这次会演应该是大力提倡革命现代戏的，但是，周扬等一伙又把一九五八年提出的“双管齐下”方针加以发展，变成了现代戏、新编历史戏和传统戏的“三者并举”的方针。其目的就是用新编历史剧和传统剧目，再一次把革命现代戏挤掉。周扬等一伙所谓的“三者并举”，实际是封建主义和资本主义的货色并举。所以这次会演后，现代戏越来越少。到一九六二年底，据全国二十六个重点戏曲剧团上演剧目的统计，现代戏只占全部上演剧目的千分之三，几乎都被挤光了。
    特别应该指出的是一九六二年九月党的八届十中全会上，党中央和毛主席提出“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，毛主席又对文化工作中的方向性错误，提出了一系列的批评。但是，周扬对毛主席的这些批评，一直采取抗拒的态度。一九六三年九月，他在中宣部召开的首都戏曲工作座谈会上说：“不能光演现代戏，不演历史剧和传统剧。”与此同时，文化部抛出六十出传统剧目的所谓“样板戏”推行全国，其中包括《强项令》《团圆之后》《打金枝》等这样一些歌颂帝王将相、才子佳人的坏戏四十二出。
    周扬之所以如此仇视革命现代戏，目的是反对戏曲去表现社会主义革命和社会主义建设的斗争生活；反对社会主义时代的工农兵英雄形象成为舞台的主人。
    周扬反对革命现代戏，也就必然对封建时代的传统戏视为至宝。在这方面，他竭力主张全盘继承的方针。
    如何对待古代文化遗产问题，毛主席在《新民主主义论》中曾经教导我们：“……清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件；但是决不能无批判地兼收并蓄。必须将古代封建统治阶级的一切腐朽的东西和古代优秀的人民文化即多少带有民主性和革命性的东西区别开来。”
    在这个问题上，周扬是竭力反对毛主席的指示的。
    从一九五二年第一届全国戏曲会演，到一九五六年文化部第一届戏曲剧目工作会议，周扬在他的两次讲话中，在戏曲剧目工作的具体方针上，公然提出一个违背毛泽东思想的所谓“人民性”的修正主义的谬论。所谓“人民性”，概括起来有三：一是剥削阶级也有所谓的“好人”。他说：“统治阶级与人民之间可以有相通的东西。”他认为“封建道德也有人民性。”胡说什么“封建的政治哲学，伦理哲学，君臣父子之道，等等，与今天有共同点。”这不是赤裸裸地给剥削阶级涂脂抹粉吗？在他的谬论影响下，大批的帝王将相，牢固地保留在戏曲舞台上。二是鼓吹资产阶级的爱情至上。他说：“《梁山伯与祝英台》和《白蛇传》……简直可以说，他们的爱战胜了死”。在这个修正主义思想指导下，使得形形色色的才子佳人充塞了舞台。三是宣扬封建迷信。他主张所谓“不肯屈服于命运的鬼神，如李慧娘、敫桂英等这些舞台上的鬼魂，都是应该肯定提倡的。”这个谬论，成了后来舞台上大批鬼戏的护身符。
    由此可见，周扬所鼓吹的“人民性”，就是为了使大量的帝王将相、才子佳人、妖魔鬼怪，长期地占领戏曲舞台，以代替社会主义的新戏曲，向人民群众散布毒素，为复辟资本主义作舆论准备。
