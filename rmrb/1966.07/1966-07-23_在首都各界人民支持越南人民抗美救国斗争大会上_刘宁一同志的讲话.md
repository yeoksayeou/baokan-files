In the grand rally of one million people from various circles in the capital in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, Comrade Liu Ningyi, representing various people's organizations, various democratic parties, and non-partisan democrats, solemnly declared: Comrades and friends,

At this grand rally in the capital, where one million people from various circles have gathered to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, I, on behalf of various people's organizations, various democratic parties, and non-partisan democrats, solemnly declare: The statement by Chairman Liu Shaoqi read at today's meeting, and the telegram from Chairman Zhu De to President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, fully express the resolute will of 700 million Chinese people to aid Vietnam and resist the U.S. We fully support and resolutely endorse them! President Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the order issued by President Ho Chi Minh, based on the decision of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, to mobilize part of the reserve forces, demonstrate the firm resolve of the Vietnamese people to carry the struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation to the end. We express our boundless admiration and most resolute support!

Recently, while the U.S. imperialists have been sending large numbers of troops to South Vietnam, they have also attempted to use the barbaric act of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong to coerce the Vietnamese people into submission and force a "peace negotiation." This is nothing but a pipe dream. On July 17, President Ho Chi Minh solemnly declared: "The U.S. imperialists can send 500,000, 1 million, or even more troops to intensify their aggression in South Vietnam. They can use thousands of planes to intensify their bombing of North Vietnam. But they will never be able to shake the iron will and resolve of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation." "The Vietnamese people will not be intimidated! There is nothing more precious than independence and freedom." This is the solemn vow made on behalf of 31 million Vietnamese people, expressing the sublime spirit of the entire heroic Vietnamese nation to fight to the end and achieve victory. We heartily cheer for the iron will and resolve of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

Chairman Mao pointed out that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The U.S. imperialists have recently increased their troops in South Vietnam to nearly 300,000 and intensified their indiscriminate bombing. However, the U.S. imperialists have suffered repeated defeats. The U.S. aggressors are sinking deeper and deeper into the sea of war waged by the Vietnamese people, and their combat effectiveness is being increasingly destroyed. In South Vietnam, over 60,000 U.S. aggressors have been annihilated in the past year and a half, with over 40,000 of them annihilated in the first half of this year alone. In North Vietnam, over 1,200 U.S. aggressor planes have been shot down. Facts have proven that the larger the scale of the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression against Vietnam, the more miserable their defeat will be. Chairman Mao told us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again... until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." We firmly believe that in the sea of people's war, the U.S. imperialists will surely be defeated, and the Vietnamese people will surely be victorious!

In the U.S. government's criminal activities of "bombing for peace," the Soviet revisionist leadership group has played the role of the number one accomplice. After the U.S. bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, the U.S. State Department spokesman publicly stated that the U.S. had informed the "major relevant governments," including the Soviet Union, of the decision to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong in advance. Rusk also publicly demanded that the Soviet leadership group "take action and help us (the U.S.) achieve some kind of peace over there." As expected, the Soviet leadership group "took action," turning Moscow into a black market for U.S.-style peace fraud. The Soviet revisionist leadership group also went so far as to declare that the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong does not affect U.S.-Soviet cooperation and the achievement of disarmament agreements. The Soviet revisionist leadership group has always been obsessed with bringing the Vietnamese issue into the track of U.S.-Soviet cooperation and has consistently served the U.S. imperialists. This makes them nothing but the target of the international united front against U.S. imperialism. The facts tell us that to oppose imperialism, we must also oppose revisionism. In the fiery struggle against U.S. imperialism, we must not engage in any joint actions with the accomplices of U.S. imperialism.

China and Vietnam are neighboring countries that are as close as lips and teeth, and are the closest brothers. Our 700 million people are the most reliable comrades and supporters of the Vietnamese people. Our vast territory is the most effective rear base for the Vietnamese people. No matter how much the U.S. imperialists, reactionaries of various countries, and the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership slander and provoke the relationship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, attempting to sabotage the combat friendship between China and Vietnam and the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, history has determined that the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples must unite, fight together, and achieve victory together.

The Chinese people will resolutely follow the statement of the Chinese government on July 3 and the statement of Chairman Liu Shaoqi today, resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people in carrying the struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation to the end. The U.S. imperialists have broken the boundaries of war, so our aid to Vietnam and resistance against the U.S. will also have no boundaries. We will, according to the interests and requirements of the Vietnamese people, take whatever actions we deem necessary at any time and place. We are a people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, invincible, and we follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "Be determined, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." No matter how far the U.S. imperialists want to expand the war, no matter how great the risks, no matter how great the sacrifices, we will resolutely stand with our Vietnamese brothers, supporting the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation in every way, until we thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors and achieve final victory.

U.S. imperialists, get out of Vietnam!

Long live the indestructible combat friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples!

    在首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会上
    刘宁一同志的讲话
    新华社二十二日讯　我国各人民团体、各民主党派代表刘宁一同志在首都各界人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会上的讲话，全文如下：同志们、朋友们：
    在首都各界一百万人庄严举行的这个支持越南人民抗美救国斗争大会上，我代表各人民团体、各民主党派和无党派民主人士郑重表示：今天在大会上宣读的刘少奇主席的声明，朱德委员长致越南民主共和国国会常务委员会长征主席的电报，充分表达了七亿中国人民援越抗美的坚强意志，我们完全拥护和坚决拥护！越南民主共和国胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》，胡志明主席根据越南国会常务委员会的决定而颁布的关于动员一部分后备兵员的命令，表明了越南人民决心把抗美救国斗争进行到底的坚定立场，我们表示无限的钦佩和最坚决的支持！
    最近，美帝国主义在大量增派侵略军到越南南方的同时，妄图用轰炸河内、海防的野蛮行动，胁迫越南人民屈服，逼出一个“和平谈判”。这完全是白日做梦。七月十七日，胡志明主席庄严宣告：美帝国主义“可以出动五十万、一百万或者更多的军队来加强对越南南方的侵略战争。他们可以使用成千架飞机来加强对越南北方的轰炸。但是，他们绝不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。”“越南人民是不会被吓倒的！没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。”这是代表三千一百万越南人民发出的气壮山河的誓言，表达了整个英雄的越南民族决战决胜的崇高精神。我们对越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心，表示热烈欢呼。
    毛主席指出，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。美帝国主义最近把侵略越南南方的美国军队增加到近三十万人，并加紧狂轰滥炸。但是美帝国主义还是屡战屡败。美国侵略者在越南人民战争的汪洋大海里越陷越深，它的有生力量被歼灭的越来越多。在越南南方，美国侵略军一年半来被歼灭六万多名，其中四万多名是今年上半年被歼灭的。在越南北方，被击落的美国强盗飞机已达一千二百多架。事实证明，美帝国主义侵略越南的战争，规模越大，它的失败就越惨。毛主席告诉我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”我们坚信，在人民战争的火海中，美帝国主义必败，越南人民必胜！
    在美国政府“以炸迫和”的罪恶活动中，苏联修正主义领导集团担当了头号帮凶的角色。美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防之后，美国国务院发言人公开宣称，美国在事先曾把轰炸河内、海防的决定通知包括苏联在内的“主要有关政府”。腊斯克也公开要求苏联领导集团“行动起来，动手帮忙我们（美国）在那边取得某种和平”。果然，苏联领导集团就“行动起来”，让莫斯科成为美国式和平骗局的黑市场。苏联修正主义领导集团还丧心病狂地宣称，美国轰炸河内、海防，并不影响美苏合作、达成裁军协议。苏联修正主义领导集团念念不忘把越南问题纳入美苏合作的轨道，一贯为美帝国主义效劳。这就使得他们只能成为国际反美统一战线斗争的对象。事实告诉我们，反帝必须反修，在反对美帝国主义火热的斗争中，决不能同美帝国主义的帮凶搞什么联合行动。
    中国和越南是唇齿相依的邻邦，是最亲密的兄弟。我们七亿人民，是越南人民最可靠的战友和后盾。我们辽阔的国土，是越南人民最有效的大后方。不管美帝国主义、各国反动派和苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义怎样中伤和挑拨中越两国人民的关系，妄图破坏中越的战斗友谊和越南人民的抗美救国斗争，但是，历史的发展决定了，中越两国人民要团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    我国人民坚决遵循七月三日中国政府的声明和今天刘少奇主席的声明，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底。美帝国主义已经打破了战争的界限，我们援越抗美也就没有界限了。我们将根据越南人民的利益和要求，随时随地采取我们认为必要的行动。我们是毛泽东思想武装起来的不可战胜的人民，我们遵照毛主席的教导，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”不管美帝国主义要把战争扩大到什么地方，不管要冒多么大的风险，不管要付出多么大的代价，我们都坚决同兄弟的越南人民站在一起，从一切方面支援越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，直到彻底打败美国侵略者，取得最后胜利。
    美帝国主义从越南滚出去！
    中越两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
