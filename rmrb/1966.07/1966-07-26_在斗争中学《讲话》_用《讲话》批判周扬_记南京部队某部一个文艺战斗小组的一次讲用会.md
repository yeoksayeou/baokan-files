The study meeting began. The leader of the combat group, Deputy Political Instructor Xu Kai Fu, said: "The magazine 'Red Flag' republished Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art,' sounding the charge to launch a general assault on the stronghold of the revisionist literary black line. Chairman Mao's 'Talks' is the invincible great banner of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With a red book in hand and a red flag in heart, we must hold high the revolutionary banner, engage in continuous battles, and launch fierce attacks on the stronghold of the black line. This study meeting is to learn and apply on the front line. Who will fire the first shot?"

As soon as the leader of the combat group finished speaking, the model soldier Cheng Jiyang said: "Learning Chairman Mao's 'Talks' from 24 years ago on the front line is like Chairman Mao personally giving us a lecture on the front line today. Chairman Mao has given me this powerful weapon, 'Talks.' I dare to fire the first shot at the stronghold of the black line!" His topic was:

Guns, Pens, and Stamps

Guns and pens both serve politics and serve the stamp. Seizing the stamp relies on these "two weapons," and holding the stamp also relies on these "two weapons." Chairman Mao's discourse on the two armies and two fronts of literature and art tells us to firmly hold the revolutionary gun, grasp the revolutionary pen, and defend the stamp of the proletariat. The stamp of the proletariat is our lifeline. With it, we have everything; without it, we lose everything. We revolutionary soldiers carry steel guns and pen guns, fighting on both the military and cultural fronts. Our guns are tools of proletarian dictatorship, and our pens are also tools of proletarian dictatorship. Our first lesson upon enlisting was 'In Memory of Norman Bethune,' which addresses the question of whose gun to carry and whose pen to wield. In the squad, I train with my comrades for revolution; in the performance troupe, we sing revolutionary songs, perform revolutionary plays, tell revolutionary stories, and promote revolutionary books, serving as red propagandists. Once, during a night march in the rain, we walked over 120 miles. Everyone was cold and tired. We led the singing of 'The Red Army Is Not Afraid of Long Marches,' and our voices drowned out the rain. Everyone's morale soared as we rushed forward. Our guns and pens both follow the Party's and Chairman Mao's commands. We follow Chairman Mao's words, resolving the fundamental question of for whom we serve and how we serve. Thus, we can not only vanquish all enemies on the battlefield of real guns and bullets but also sweep away all ghosts and demons in the ideological class struggle.

Zhou Yang, the "patriarch" hiding in the stronghold of the black line, has always opposed the red line of Mao Zedong's literary thought. Chairman Mao told us to flourish socialist literature and art, serve proletarian politics, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and consolidate and develop proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system. Zhou Yang, however, promoted revisionist literature, serving bourgeois politics, serving landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and preparing spiritual conditions for the restoration of capitalism. They wielded black pens, writing "revolutionary" accounts on the screen and stage. They attempted to change society first by changing people, and to change people first by changing their thoughts, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism and the overthrow of proletarian dictatorship. They dreamed of achieving this without guns or cannons, merely by changing the flags on the city walls. Their black pens are the claws of "seizing the stamp," the soft knives that kill without bloodshed. They held pens in their hands, eyes on our guns, and hearts on seizing our stamps. We must never think this is a matter of scholars, literature, or literary struggle. Pens are spiritual and ideological. If the direction of the pen changes, the gun will turn, the stamp will change color, and heads will roll. The "scholarly discussions" of the anti-party clique are aimed at "heads rolling, blood spattered." They wield black pens, write black plays, compose black songs, edit black books, and dream black dreams, hoping for the blood-spattered heads of millions of revolutionary people in a counter-revolutionary restoration!

Zhou Yang also put on the airs of a "patriarch," donning the cloak of a "Marxist-Leninist literary theorist," trying to intimidate us, making us "soldiers" afraid to deal with their "scholars." This is a foolish dream! They shout "Raise high the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary thought," but hold the black banner of bourgeois and revisionist literature. We have seen enough of the two-faced tactics of counter-revolutionaries. The Zhou Yang clique cannot intimidate or deceive us! We not only want to be voluntary soldiers of communism but also red scholars of the proletariat. We want to deal with Zhou Yang and his anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought "black scholars." Because we understand that the red pen of the proletariat and the black pen of the bourgeoisie cannot "coexist peacefully." Either you surrender your "weapons," or I surrender mine. The day of "peaceful coexistence" is the day of "peaceful evolution." Contending for the pen is contending for the gun, contending for the stamp. This is a life-and-death struggle. We must firmly hold the "two weapons" and defend the stamp of the proletariat to the death!

Cheng Jiyang had just finished speaking when everyone started discussing. Under the influence of the revisionist literary black line, fallacies abound, and weeds grow rampant. Where is the root of this black line? The model soldier Li Qing, who had long written articles criticizing 'The Dismissal of Hai Rui,' said: With Chairman Mao's 'Talks' as a mirror, no matter how deep the root is buried, we can dig it out. His topic was:

From the Attic to the Revolutionary Base

Who allowed foreigners, the dead, and "literature of the 1930s" to dominate the stage? Who drove the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers off the stage and into the cold palace? Who reversed praise and exposure? Why did ghosts and demons once strut arrogantly? What about the "theory of the middle character," the anti-"theme determines content" theory, 'Early Spring in February,' 'A Thousand Miles Against the Wind,' and all the fallacies and weeds! All this comes from the root of the revisionist literary black line, the "patriarch" Zhou Yang. What grows from the root grows the vine, and what grows from the vine bears the fruit. With Zhou Yang as the big poisonous root, black vines of anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought sprout; with these black vines, black fruits of anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought grow.

Zhou Yang's black vines began to spread from the 1930s to the 1960s, growing blacker. They seized the leadership of the literary and art departments, not only trying to bring the attic of the 1930s, where they peddled bourgeois goods, to the revolutionary base of the 1940s, Yan'an, but also trying to establish their new attic in the 1960s, in the world revolutionary base, the hearts of the world's revolutionary people—New China. They dreamed of setting up a Chinese version of the "Petofi Club" on the cultural battlefield of the proletariat, preparing public opinion for usurping the Party, the army, and the government. Now the truth is clear: the one who distorted historical facts is Zhou Yang; the one who reversed praise and exposure, light and darkness, is Zhou Yang; the one who tried to reverse historical eras and the direction of social development is still Zhou Yang!

We warn the Zhou Yang clique: your conspiracies will never succeed! What "literature of the 1930s," what "patriarch," "old man," "literary authority," are all the dregs of history. Only the Mao Zedong era is the best, only Mao Zedong's literary thought is the most revolutionary literary thought, and only the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the highest authority! In the past, we did not follow their "national defense literature" slogan that abolishes the leadership of proletarian literature; today, we will absolutely not follow their "popular literature" slogan that fights for the artistic and political stages for ghosts and demons. We remember Chairman Mao's teachings and will absolutely not follow them, absolutely not let their new 'Miss Saigon' spread freely. "Following them is actually following the big landlords and big bourgeoisie," it is following counter-revolutionaries. To defend Mao Zedong Thought, to defend the world revolutionary base, to defend the Yan'an in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, we must thoroughly uproot Zhou Yang, this big poisonous root, cut off his black vines, smash his black fruits filled with "time bombs," and completely destroy the "attic" style "Petofi Club" where the "patriarch" of the revisionist literary black line nests! We must, on the cultural battlefield of the proletariat, with the greatest breadth and depth, firmly plant the roots of socialism, communism, and Mao Zedong Thought. Let feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism have no "foothold," no "soil" to grow, completely uproot and eradicate them!

"Human nature" is an old trick of revisionist literature. Deputy Squad Leader Wu Runsheng comes from a poor peasant family. His uncle is a capitalist. After studying Chairman Mao's 'Talks,' he felt he had a lot to say. His topic was:

Human Nature and Class Nature

In the world, where is there such a thing as classless "human nature," it's absurd! Like my uncle, he is a capitalist, and we are poor peasants. In the old society, he indulged in pleasures every day, eating fish and meat, while we drank wild vegetable soup all year round. Once, he hypocritically said he wanted to "help" us, calling my brother and sister to work in his factory. Mom knew he was a wolf in sheep's clothing, but the family had nothing to eat, so she had to agree. As soon as my brother and sister entered his factory, they became "indentured servants," far from being "helped," they were pushed into the fire pit. By the time of liberation, they were only skin and bones. My uncle's "human nature" really harmed our family! Chairman Mao said: "In class society, there is only class-natured human nature, and no classless human nature." Chairman Mao truly spoke for us poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants, thousands of families, one class; thousands of hearts, millions of hearts, close to the Communist Party, close to Chairman Mao. We and my uncle, one family, one surname, two classes, sworn enemies, can never get along!

The recently exposed "patriarch" of bourgeois literature, Zhou Yang, is of the same ilk as landlords and capitalists! He raised the black flag of "popular literature," shouting that literature is "for all classes to see, resonating with all people." What a "all classes," what a "all people"! This is not a new "invention," but a theory that Chairman Mao had already exposed in 'Talks' as "human nature," a broken piece of junk from the trash can. Zhou Yang closely followed Khrushchev's ass, trying to change the face of "human nature," slap on new labels, play tricks, and deceive people. We workers, peasants, and soldiers, armed with 'Talks' as a mirror, can see through his black heart at a glance!

The Zhou Yang clique desperately promotes "popular literature," dressing themselves up as impartial, wearing a mask of justice, as if they have no "class nature" at all. This is a big deception. The "class nature" of the Zhou Yang clique is very clear! The Zhou Yang clique has their own calculations. They want to use "popular literature" as a cover, using the sugar-coated bullets of "human nature" to make us forget class struggle and proletarian dictatorship while watching books, plays, and movies. In laughter and joy, we are hit by their sugar-coated bullets, uninjured, unharmed, unknowingly undergoing peaceful evolution, becoming their reactionary clique's "captives." This is daydreaming! We revolutionary soldiers read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions all our lives. Class analysis is our sharpest weapon. Whoever dares to be the enemy of the people will absolutely not escape the punishment of the revolutionary people!

The discussion meeting reached this point, and everyone started interjecting. Some comrades pointed out: The current struggle in the ideological realm is a fierce battle between two worldviews. Squad Leader Zhang Zongrong picked up the topic and said: The Zhou Yang clique dresses themselves up as "noble" spiritual aristocrats, but their souls are the dirtiest. Then he spoke about:

Clean and Dirty

Chairman Mao strongly emphasizes the transformation of the worldview of literary and art workers. He said: "We intellectuals who are literary and art workers must change our thoughts and feelings, undergo a transformation. Without this change, without this transformation, nothing can be done well, everything will be out of place." However, Zhou Yang said that a "talented" writer can "advance towards an advanced worldview" through his own creative path. He even cursed: "Attributing everything to worldview is vulgarizing worldview." Chairman Mao pointed out: Transforming the worldview must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, go to the fiery struggle. The Zhou Yang clique, however, put up a shield: This problem was solved by us in the 1930s, and the drama troupes at that time had already been "revolutionized." Look, to what extent the Zhou Yang clique opposes Mao Zedong Thought on the issue of transforming the worldview! We must warn these "patriarchs" and "old men": Although you dress yourselves up as so "noble" and so "clean," we workers, peasants, and soldiers, with 'Talks' as a mirror, can see through your dirty souls!

Why does Zhou Yang sing the opposite tune to Chairman Mao's instructions on transforming the worldview? In short, they want to pull people's souls towards the capitalist path. Worldview is a person's "master switch," this "master switch" is either controlled by the proletariat or by the bourgeoisie. The Zhou Yang clique is so eager to blur the boundaries between two completely opposing worldviews, deny the guiding and directing role of worldview on people's practice, precisely to drag people towards their revisionist literary black line, to surrender to the bourgeoisie in the 1930s, and to restore capitalism today. They dream of using their bourgeois worldview to transform the Party, the people, and the world. They write plays, articles, seize people's minds, and think of a capitalist world. Can we let them do this? Absolutely not!

In the fierce battle between two worldviews today, we revolutionaries must always stand unshakable, read Chairman Mao's books, and work hard on the "use" of them, focusing on the fundamental issue of transforming the worldview. Before enlisting, I was a teacher. After enlisting, I have been participating in production labor in the military farm. In labor tempering, I repeatedly studied a passage from Chairman Mao: "The cleanest are still the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are still cleaner than the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoisie intellectuals." I deeply felt that "moving the standpoint over," "moving to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers, moving to the side of the proletariat," is the most important thing for us young intellectuals. It was in this great school of learning Mao Zedong Thought, the military farm, that I gradually tanned my skin and reddened my heart. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must take Chairman Mao's 'Talks' as the highest instruction for fighting the enemy and also as the highest instruction for transforming the worldview. Learn in struggle, use in struggle, transform in struggle. The Zhou Yang clique is most afraid of us doing this. They dress themselves up as spiritual aristocrats high above the "lower class," cursing us for vigorously grasping the transformation of the worldview as "vulgarizing." We warn the Zhou Yang clique: We workers, peasants, and soldiers, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have established a proletarian worldview, which is the cleanest and most noble. You are driven by fame and wealth, vigorously promoting the "three names" of "famous writers, famous actors, famous directors" and the "three highs" of "high salary, high manuscript fee, high bonus"; you are spiritually corrupt, spreading bourgeois ideology and lifestyle everywhere, you are the most vulgar and dirty. We will smash your bourgeois worldview, along with your old world, to pieces!

The discussion meeting was very lively. Finally, the leader of the combat group, Xu Kai Fu, gave a concluding speech: Chairman Mao's 'Talks' is our banner for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—

Mirror and Battle Cry

Chairman Mao's 'Talks' is like a sun with infinite rays, illuminating the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

'Talks' most completely, most comprehensively, and most systematically summarizes the struggle between the two lines on the cultural front, systematically criticizing the bourgeois literary line of the 1930s represented by Zhou Yang. After national liberation, the Zhou Yang clique became more cunning, more treacherous, and more frantic. They waved the red flag to oppose the red flag, appearing on stage to perform black plays. Sometimes they were the vengeful ghost Li Hui Niang, sometimes they dressed up as the "beautiful woman" Xie Yaohuan who advocated "covering" the proletarian dictatorship, and sometimes they transformed into the "clean official" Hai Rui who summoned the rightist opportunists. How to see through the demons and ghosts in various disguises? Chairman Mao's 'Talks' is the mirror that makes us see through the wolfish ambitions of demons and ghosts—opposing the Party, opposing socialism, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and paving the way for the restoration of capitalism. 'Talks' not only makes demons reveal their true forms but also makes demons have nowhere to hide.

'Talks' is also the battle cry. Twenty-four years ago, it sounded the charge to launch a general assault on Wang Ming's right-opportunist line in politics, organization, and culture; twenty-four years later, today, it sounds the charge to launch a general assault on the stronghold of the revisionist literary black line. The battle cry is the command. We must fight fiercely, fight deeply, and thoroughly destroy the stronghold of the black line.

We take up 'Talks,' this sharpest weapon, to sweep away all demons and ghosts, to thoroughly eliminate all old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and to establish new thoughts, new culture, new customs, and new habits. In the end, it is to thoroughly destroy the old world and build a new communist world. The faster we destroy, the faster we establish. This great revolution is like splitting bamboo, crushing withered grass, extraordinarily swift, accelerating the complete collapse of the old world and also accelerating the pace of socialism and the progress of communism.

This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great school for learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought. In this school, Chairman Mao teaches us to master the most important skill of class struggle. Our combat group, with boundless love for Chairman Mao's 'Talks,' learns and fights simultaneously, and we don't know how many times we have learned it. We will learn it a thousand times, ten thousand times, truly understand it, master it, and apply it. As long as we act according to Chairman Mao's 'Talks,' we will definitely create a brand-new proletarian new culture, definitely push the thought revolution to a higher stage, and definitely fight for a brilliant communist new world!

    在斗争中学《讲话》  用《讲话》批判周扬
    ——记南京部队某部一个文艺战斗小组的一次讲用会
    讲用会开始了。战斗小组长、副指导员徐开福说：“《红旗》杂志重新发表毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，吹响了向修正主义文艺黑线老巢总攻的进军号。毛主席的《讲话》是无产阶级文化大革命无往不胜的伟大旗帜。一本红书捧胸前，一杆红旗心中飘。我们要高举革命大旗，进行连续战斗，向黑线老巢猛烈开火。这个讲用会，就是火线上学，火线上用。谁开头炮？”
    战斗小组长话音刚落，五好战士程继尧就说：“火线上学习毛主席二十四年前的《讲话》，就象毛主席今天亲临火线给我们讲话一样。毛主席把《讲话》这个威力无穷的武器交给了我，我敢向黑线老巢开头炮！”他讲的题目是——
    枪杆子笔杆子和印把子
    枪杆子和笔杆子都是为政治服务、为印把子服务的。夺取印把子要靠这“两杆子”，握紧印把子也要靠这“两杆子”。毛主席关于文武两支军队、两个战线的论述，就是告诉我们要握紧革命的枪杆子，抓牢革命的笔杆子，保卫无产阶级的印把子。无产阶级的印把子是我们的命根子。有了它，就有了一切；失去它，就失去一切。我们革命战士拿钢枪，也拿笔枪，是文武两条战线的战斗员。我们的枪杆子是无产阶级专政的工具，我们的笔杆子也是无产阶级专政的工具。我们入伍第一课，学的就是《为人民服务》，就是解决枪杆子为谁拿、笔杆子为谁摇的问题。在班里我和同志们一起为革命练兵；在演唱组里，我们唱革命歌，演革命戏，讲革命故事，宣传革命书籍，当红色宣传员。有一次雨夜行军，走了一百二十多里，大家又冷又累。我们带头唱起《红军不怕远征难》，歌声压过雨声，大家斗志昂扬地向前飞奔。我们的枪杆和笔杆都听党的指挥，听毛主席的指挥。我们听毛主席的话，把为谁服务和怎样服务这个根本问题真正解决了，就不但能在真枪实弹的战场上，压倒一切敌人，而且能在意识形态领域的阶级斗争中，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。
    周扬这个藏在黑线老巢里的“祖师爷”，一贯和毛泽东文艺思想的红线相对抗。毛主席告诉我们，要繁荣社会主义文艺，为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务，为巩固和发展无产阶级专政和社会主义制度服务。周扬却大搞修正主义文艺，为资产阶级政治服务，为地富反坏右服务，为复辟资本主义准备精神条件。他们摇着黑笔杆，在银幕上、舞台上大写“变天账”。他们想用变天先变人，变人先变思想的办法，为复辟资本主义、推翻无产阶级专政做舆论准备；他们妄想不用枪、不用炮，就来个城头上面换旗号。他们的黑笔杆是“夺印”的魔爪，是杀人不见血的软刀子。他们手里摇着笔杆子，眼睛瞪着我们的枪杆子，心里想夺我们的印把子。我们千万不能认为这是文人、文事、文斗。笔杆子是精神的东西，意识形态的东西。笔杆子变了向，枪杆子就会转向，印把子就会变色，人头就要落地。反党黑帮的“书生议论”，是为了“头颅掷处血斑斑”。他们拿黑笔、写黑戏、谱黑歌、编黑书、做黑梦，盼望的正是千百万革命人民人头落地的血迹斑斑的反革命复辟！
    周扬还摆出一副“祖师爷”的架子，披着“马列主义文艺理论家”的外衣，想吓唬我们，叫我们这些“兵”不敢去管他们那些“秀才”，这是痴心梦想！他们嘴里喊的是
  “高举毛泽东文艺思想红旗”，手里拿的却是资产阶级、修正主义文艺黑旗。反革命的两面手法我们见得多了，周扬之流吓不倒也骗不了我们！我们不但要当共产主义的义务兵，而且要当无产阶级的红秀才，我们就是要管管周扬这些反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的“黑秀才”。因为我们懂得，无产阶级的红笔和资产阶级的黑笔决不能“和平共处”，不是你缴我的“械”，就是我缴你的“械”。“和平共处”之日，就是“和平演变”之时。争笔杆子就是争枪杆子，就是争印把子。这是你死我活的斗争。我们一定要握紧“两杆子”，誓死保卫无产阶级的印把子！
    程继尧刚讲完，大家就议论道：在修正主义文艺黑线影响下，谬论百出，毒草丛生。这条黑线的毒根在哪里？很早就写文章批判《海瑞罢官》的五好战士李庆说：有了毛主席的《讲话》这面照妖镜，毒根埋得再深，我们也能把它挖出来。他讲的是——
    从亭子间到革命根据地
    是谁让洋人、死人和“三十年代”文艺在文艺舞台上满台飞？是谁把工农兵形象赶到台下，打入冷宫？是谁把歌颂和暴露大大颠倒？为什么牛鬼蛇神一度神气活现？什么“写中间人物”论啦，反“题材决定”论啦，什么《早春二月》啦，《逆风千里》啦，真是谬论百出，毒草丛生！这一切，都来自一个总毒根——修正主义文艺黑线的“祖师爷”周扬。什么根长什么藤，什么藤结什么瓜。有了周扬这个大毒根，就长出反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑“藤”；有了这根黑“藤”，就结出反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑“瓜”。
    周扬的黑藤，是从他所鼓吹的“三十年代”文艺开始长起来的。毛主席在《讲话》以及其他著作中，早已对三十年代文艺作了历史性的总结，指出三十年代存在两种对立的文学：以鲁迅为代表的“民族革命战争的大众文学”，即无产阶级文学，和以周扬为代表的“国防文学”，即资产阶级文学。毛主席在《讲话》中指出：“从亭子间到革命根据地，不但是经历了两种地区，而且是经历了两个历史时代”；“过去的时代，已经一去不复返了”。可是周扬从上海亭子间到延安，不但不认真改造思想，反而继续顽强地保持他那一套主张，要按照他们的面貌来改造党，改造世界。正如毛主席尖锐地指出的：“你们那一套是不行的，无产阶级是不能迁就你们的，依了你们，实际上就是依了大地主大资产阶级，就有亡党亡国的危险。”放眼看看今天的斗争，回头读读毛主席的教导，就象是今天写的一样，每个字都象沉重的铁锤，狠狠地打在牛鬼蛇神的心窝上！
    周扬的黑藤，从三十年代一直蔓延到六十年代，越长越黑。他们窃取文艺部门的领导权，不但想把三十年代贩卖资产阶级黑货的“亭子间”，搬到四十年代的中国革命根据地延安来，而且想在六十年代的世界革命根据地、世界革命人民心中的延安——新中国，建立他们的新“亭子间”。他们妄想在无产阶级的文化阵地上，用他们的“亭子间”开设中国式的“裴多菲俱乐部”，为篡党篡军篡政做舆论准备。现在已经真相大白，颠倒革命史实的，是周扬；颠倒歌颂和暴露、光明和黑暗的，是周扬；妄想颠倒历史时代、颠倒社会发展方向的，还是周扬！
    正告周扬之流：你们的阴谋是绝对不会得逞的！什么三十年代文艺，什么“祖师爷”、“老头子”、“文艺权威”，统统是历史的渣滓。只有毛泽东时代最好，只有毛泽东文艺思想是最革命的文艺思想，只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵是最高的权威！过去，我们没有依你们那个取消无产阶级文艺领导权的“国防文学”口号；今天，我们也绝对不会依你们那个为牛鬼蛇神争艺术舞台和政治舞台的“全民文艺”口号。我们牢记毛主席的教导，绝对不能依你们，绝对不能让你们的新《赛金花》自由泛滥。“依了你们，实际上就是依了大地主大资产阶级”，就是依了反革命。为了保卫毛泽东思想，为了保卫世界革命根据地，为了保卫世界革命人民心中的延安，我们一定要彻底挖出周扬这个大毒根，斩断他的黑藤，砸烂他装着“定时炸弹”的黑瓜，把修正主义文艺黑线“祖师爷”盘踞的“裴多菲俱乐部”式的“亭子间”彻底捣毁！我们要在无产阶级的文化阵地上，以最大的广度和深度，扎牢社会主义、共产主义和毛泽东思想的根子。让封建主义、资本主义、修正主义没有“落脚”之地，没有生长的“土壤”，统统断根、绝根！
    “人性论”是修正主义文艺的老骗术。副班长吴润生家里是贫农，他大伯是个资本家。学习了毛主席的《讲话》，他觉得有满肚子的话要说。他谈的就是——
    人性和阶级性
    世界上哪有什么超阶级的“人性”，真是活见鬼！象我大伯，他是资本家，我们是贫农。他在旧社会整天花天酒地，吃鱼吃肉，我们一年到头喝的是野菜汤。有一回，他假惺惺地说要“拉扯”我们一把，叫我哥哥和姐姐到他厂里去做工。妈知道他是黄鼠狼给鸡拜年，没安好心，可家里实在没吃的，只得答应了。哥哥和姐姐一进了他的厂，就成了“卖身工”，哪里是什么“拉扯”我们一把，硬是把他们推进了火坑。挨到解放，只剩下一身皮包骨。我大伯这分“人性”，真把我家害苦了！毛主席说：“在阶级社会里就是只有带着阶级性的人性，而没有什么超阶级的人性”。毛主席真是说出了我们贫下中农的心里话。我们贫下中农，千家万户，一个阶级；千颗心万颗心，贴着共产党，贴着毛主席。我们跟大伯，一家一姓，两个阶级，冤家对头，根本凑不到一块去！
    最近被揪出来的资产阶级文艺的“祖师爷”周扬，跟地主、资本家完全是一路货！他打起“全民文艺”这面黑旗，大叫大嚷文艺是
  “给所有的阶级看的，引起所有人的共鸣”。好一个“所有的阶级”，好一个“所有的人”！这根本不是新“发明”，是毛主席在《讲话》中早就批臭了的“人性论”，是从垃圾箱里拣来的破烂货。周扬紧紧跟在赫鲁晓夫的屁股后面，想把“人性论”改头换面，贴上新标签，变套鬼把戏，拿来招摇撞骗。我们工农兵掌握了《讲话》这面照妖镜，一眼就能看穿他的黑心肠！
    周扬黑帮拚命鼓吹“全民文艺”，把自己装扮成不偏不倚，一副公正面孔，似乎他一点“阶级性”也没有，这是一个大骗局。周扬之流的“阶级性”鲜明得很！周扬一伙有他的如意算盘。他们想以“全民的文艺”作为幌子，用“人性论”的糖衣炮弹，让我们在看书、看戏、看电影的时候忘掉阶级斗争，忘掉无产阶级专政，在说说笑笑当中，被他们的糖衣炮弹打中，不挂花，不带彩，不知不觉地和平演变过去，成为他们反动黑帮的“俘虏”。这真是白日做梦！我们革命战士一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。阶级分析是我们手中最最锐利的武器，谁敢死心塌地与人民为敌，谁就绝对逃脱不了革命人民对他的惩罚！
    讲用会开到这里，大家互相插话。有的同志指出：当前这场意识形态领域里的阶级斗争，是两种世界观大决胜负的激烈搏斗。班长张宗荣接过话题说：周扬黑帮把自己打扮成“高尚”的精神贵族，其实他们的灵魂最肮脏。接着他讲起了——
    干净和不干净
    毛主席十分强调文艺工作者的世界观改造。他说：“我们知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”但是，周扬却说什么一个“有才能”的作家，可以“通过自己的创作道路”“走向先进的世界观”。他甚至还叫骂道：“把一切都归之世界观，就把世界观庸俗化了。”毛主席指出：改造世界观一定要到工农兵中去，到火热的斗争中去。周扬一伙却推出了一张挡箭牌：这个问题我们在三十年代就已经解决了，那时候的戏剧团体已经“革命化”了。看，在改造世界观这个问题上，周扬一伙反对毛泽东思想猖狂到什么地步！我们要正告这些“祖师爷”“老头子”，你们虽然把自己打扮得那么“高尚”、那么“干净”，我们工农兵手里有了《讲话》这面照妖镜，就能看穿你们的肮脏灵魂！
    周扬为什么同毛主席关于改造世界观的指示大唱反调呢？说穿了，他们就是要把人们的灵魂往资本主义道上拉。世界观，是一个人的“总开关”，这个“总开关”不是由无产阶级来掌握，就是由资产阶级来掌握。周扬一伙所以这样竭力模糊两种完全敌对的世界观的界限，否认世界观对人们实践的支配作用和指导作用，就是要把人们拖向他们那一条修正主义文艺黑线，在三十年前，跟他们去投降资产阶级；在今天，跟他们去复辟资本主义。他们妄图用他们的资产阶级世界观来改造党，改造人民，改造世界。他们写的是戏，是文章，抓的是人们的头脑，想的是资本主义天下。能让他们这样搞下去吗？绝对不能！
    在两种世界观激烈搏斗的今天，我们革命者要永远立于不败之地，就要读毛主席的书，在“用”字上狠下功夫，下在改造世界观这个根本问题上。我入伍前当教师，入伍后一直在部队农场参加生产劳动。我在劳动锻炼中反复学习了毛主席的一段话：“最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。”深深体会到“把立足点移过来”，“移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来”，对我们知识青年来说，是头等重要的事情。我就是在部队农场这个学习毛泽东思想的大学校里，逐渐晒黑了皮肤，炼红了心的。在当前这场无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要把毛主席的《讲话》当作对敌斗争的最高指示，也当作改造世界观的最高指示。在斗争中学，在斗争中用，在斗争中改造。周扬一伙最怕我们这样做。他们把自己扮成高踞于“下等人”之上的精神贵族，骂我们狠抓世界观改造是“庸俗化”。正告周扬之流：我们工农兵按照毛主席的教导，树立了无产阶级世界观，是最干净、最高尚的。你们名利熏心，竭力鼓吹“名作家、名演员、名导演”的“三名主义”和“高薪金、高稿酬、高奖金”的“三高政策”；你们灵魂糜烂，到处散布资产阶级思想意识和生活方式，你们才是最最庸俗最最肮脏不过的。我们要把你们死死抱住的那个资产阶级世界观连同你们的旧世界统统炸个粉碎！
    讲用会开得很热烈。最后，战斗小组长徐开福总结发言说：毛主席的《讲话》是我们进行无产阶级文化大革命的——
    照妖镜和进军号
    毛主席的《讲话》象光芒万丈的太阳，照亮了无产阶级文化大革命的道路。
    《讲话》最完整、最全面、最系统地总结了文化战线上两条道路的斗争，对以周扬为代表的三十年代资产阶级文艺路线作了系统的批判。全国解放后，周扬黑帮变得更加狡猾、更加阴险、更加疯狂。他们打着“红旗”反红旗，粉墨登场唱黑戏。他们一会儿是咬牙切齿的厉鬼李慧娘，一会儿又装扮成鼓吹“覆”无产阶级的专政之“舟”的“美女”谢瑶环，一会儿又变成为右倾机会主义分子招魂的“清官”海瑞。怎样识破披着各式各样画皮的妖魔鬼怪？毛主席的《讲话》就是照妖镜，使我们透过牛鬼蛇神的各种画皮，看清它们的狼子野心——反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。《讲话》不但能够照得妖魔现出原形，而且能够照得妖魔无处逃藏。
    《讲话》又是进军号。二十四年前，它吹响了在政治上、组织上、文化上向王明的右倾机会主义路线总攻的进军号；二十四年后的今天，它又吹响了向修正主义文艺黑线老巢总攻的进军号。号声就是命令。我们要猛打猛冲，打纵深战斗，彻底摧毁黑线老巢。
    我们拿起《讲话》这个最最锐利的武器，扫除一切牛鬼蛇神，就是要彻底破除一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，树立新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯。归根结底就是要彻底捣毁旧世界，建立共产主义新世界。不破不立，破得越快，立得越快。这场大革命，势如破竹，摧枯拉朽，迅猛异常，加速了旧世界的彻底崩溃，同时也就加快了社会主义步伐，加速了共产主义的进程。
    这场无产阶级文化大革命，就是一所活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大学校。在这所学校里，毛主席教我们学会阶级斗争这个最重要的本领。我们战斗小组怀着对毛主席《讲话》的无限热爱，边学边战斗，不知已经学了多少遍。我们还要学它一千遍、一万遍，真正学懂它，学通它，学到手。只要我们按照毛主席的《讲话》办事，就一定能够创造出崭新的无产阶级新文化，一定能够把思想革命化推向一个更高的阶段，一定能够斗出一个光辉灿烂的共产主义新世界！
