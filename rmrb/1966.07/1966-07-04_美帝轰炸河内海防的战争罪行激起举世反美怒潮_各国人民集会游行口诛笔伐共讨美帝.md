The war crimes of the U.S. imperialists bombing Hanoi and Haiphong have sparked widespread indignation and strong protests from people around the world. In recent days, public figures in various countries have held rallies, marches, and issued statements, supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. struggle and condemning the Johnson administration's "escalation" of the war.

In North Korea, workers from many factories and enterprises have held meetings in recent days to strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' serious crime of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong.

At a meeting held on June 2 at the Yongseong Machinery Factory, the deputy chairman of the factory's trade union, Ji Byeong-cheol, said that the barbaric crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in Vietnam show that it is a bloodthirsty wolf and the culprit of aggression and war. He said that the Korean people will forever stand shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people until they achieve final victory.

At a meeting held on June 1 at the Pyongyang Textile Factory, the factory director, Kang Jae-won, said that no matter what means U.S. imperialism uses, it will never make the Vietnamese people submit, and it will surely suffer a shameful defeat.

Workers from the Pyongyang Thermal Power Plant, Pyongyang Construction Machinery Factory, and Heungnam Port also held meetings to condemn U.S. imperialism on June 1 and 2.

On June 30, more than ten thousand people in the Romanian capital held a large-scale demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy, strongly protesting the U.S. imperialists' heinous crime of savagely bombing Hanoi and Haiphong on June 29.

The angry crowd chanted slogans such as "Down with the U.S. aggressors!" and "U.S. aggressors, get out of Vietnam!" They lit torches and burned a symbol of the U.S. aggressors. Because the U.S. Embassy refused to open its doors, some demonstrators climbed over the wall and entered the embassy to hand over a protest letter.

When the U.S. Embassy staff peeked out from the windows, the demonstrators threw stones, eggs, and dirt at the U.S. Embassy building, the U.S. flag, and the U.S. emblem from outside the iron gate.

The demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy lasted for more than an hour.

Before coming to the U.S. Embassy, the demonstrators held a rally to protest the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong. More than ten thousand workers, students, and government officials who participated in the rally were filled with indignation and repeatedly chanted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" and "Vietnam will win, the U.S. will lose!"

About 2,500 workers in Tokyo, Japan, held a rally on the evening of June 1 to strongly protest the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.

The rally unanimously passed two protest letters to U.S. President Johnson and Japanese Prime Minister Sato. The rally also sent a telegram supporting the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

At the same time, the rally passed a declaration demanding that the U.S. immediately stop its military actions in Vietnam and withdraw its troops from Vietnam.

The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization issued a statement in Cairo on July 1, condemning the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, calling it "a new dangerous step in the U.S. imperialists' gradual escalation of the war in Vietnam."

The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization called on the people of Asia and Africa and all peace-loving and freedom-loving people around the world to condemn the barbaric crimes of U.S. imperialism; to demand that U.S. imperialism unconditionally stop its aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and end its war of aggression in South Vietnam; to withdraw all its troops and its puppet troops from South Vietnam, and to let the Vietnamese people solve their internal problems.

The Arab Labor International Federation also issued a statement condemning the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong and condemning its policy of aggression in Vietnam. The Arab Labor International Federation supports the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and calls on revolutionary people around the world to support them.

On June 30, fourteen Chilean congressmen issued a statement saying that the U.S. savage bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is a blatant violation of international law. The statement demands that the U.S. immediately stop such warlike actions and withdraw its troops from South Vietnam.

On June 29, about 150 people in Ottawa, Canada, held a protest rally. The meeting called on the broad masses of Ottawa to actively participate in the protest demonstration to be held in front of the U.S. Ambassador's residence on July 4.

In the early hours of June 30, many young people in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Consulate to protest the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong. That evening, many young people in the center of Amsterdam held another demonstration against the U.S. war in Vietnam. The police arrested 85 young people.
