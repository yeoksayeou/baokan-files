Chinese physicists Wang Rong today morning, on behalf of the Beijing Basic Particle Theory Group, delivered a report at the plenary session of the Beijing Physics Symposium. The report once again demonstrated with irrefutable facts that Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible weapon in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. As long as one can master and apply this weapon well in scientific experimentation, one can fully unleash subjective initiative and transform spiritual power into immense material force.

The report, titled "Research on Basic Particle Theory Under the Radiance of Mao Zedong Thought," explained that Chinese physicists participating in the research work of the Beijing Basic Particle Theory Group, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, dared to practice and were good at practicing. They delved deep into the heart of contradictions and creatively proposed the "layeron model" theory, which reflects the internal structure of basic particles, pushing the theoretical research on the internal structure of basic particles forward by a significant step.

The discovery that atoms can be divided was a major breakthrough at the beginning of the 20th century. Whether the basic particles that make up atoms have their own internal structure and can be further divided has become a top priority and extremely difficult topic in contemporary physics research. Breaking through this topic will greatly advance humanity's understanding of the objective material world and its laws of motion. As the general crisis of the capitalist world deepens and Western bourgeois culture declines, empiricism and mathematical idealism have spread widely in basic particle theory research. Some Western bourgeois physics "authorities" either do not acknowledge that the internal structure of over a hundred basic particles has deeper layers, or they dare not touch the essential issue of the internal structure of basic particles.

Chinese physicists participating in the research work of the Beijing Basic Particle Theory Group actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, set high aspirations, and are determined to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level, boosting the morale of the Chinese people. In their long march into the internal domain of basic particles, they strive to be honorable vanguards. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings on liberating the mind and breaking superstitions, using Chairman Mao's brilliant philosophical thought that "everything in the world can be divided into two" as the highest guideline. They conducted a thorough investigation and research on the history of modern physics, systematically analyzed and criticized the serious obstacles that bourgeois idealism and metaphysics have caused to the development of natural sciences, thereby breaking free from the old framework of worshipping Western "authorities" and critically absorbing the research results of predecessors. Over the past year, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they have conducted extensive research and finally proposed the "layeron model" theory regarding the internal structure of basic particles, pointing out that basic particles are composed of more fundamental entities within them, namely layerons and anti-layerons. At the same time, they also proposed a new theoretical calculation method for handling this "layeron model." The term "layeron" was proposed by Chinese physicists in response to the erroneous view of Western scholars that basic particles cannot be further divided. "Layer" indicates that the structure of matter has an infinite number of layers, meaning that layerons are not the ultimate elements. According to the structural theory of the "layeron model" and its set of theoretical calculation methods, many phenomena in the domain of basic particles that old theories cannot explain and cannot uniformly describe can be explained and uniformly described, which is of great value for further in-depth research on the internal structure of basic particles.

The report also mentioned that 80% of the Chinese scientists participating in the Beijing Basic Particle Theory Group are young. Many of them actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, establishing a worldview of conducting scientific research for the revolution. In scientific experiments, they dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to venture, and dare to revolutionize, and thus quickly made contributions to the research work.

The report by Chinese physicists attracted the attention of scientists from four continents. Some of them expressed warm congratulations on the significant achievements made by Chinese physicists under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, while others highly praised the rapid growth of Chinese young scientists. Some also raised questions from an academic perspective and further discussed with Chinese physicists in a very harmonious atmosphere.

At today's morning plenary session, Japanese scientist Kobayashi Shuzō also delivered a report titled "New Developments in Basic Particle Theory - The Sakata Model." Kobayashi Shuzō summarized the contributions made by Japanese physicists in the field of basic particle theory over the past ten years since Sakata Shōichi proposed the Sakata model in 1955. His report was also welcomed by the attendees.

This afternoon, scientists from various countries continued to hold academic meetings in groups, presenting papers or engaging in academic discussions.

At the academic meeting of the Basic Particle Group, scientists from various countries had a heated discussion on the academic report delivered by Chinese physicists this morning and the three papers related to the "layeron model" presented yesterday. During the discussion, Japanese young physicists Ōba Ichirō and Imachi Masahiro each made thematic speeches, introducing some of their work in basic particle research.

At the academic meeting of the Nuclear Physics Group, Japanese scientist Ikeda Kiyomi presented a paper explaining some phenomena in nuclear decay. Japanese young scientist Hiroshige introduced the work done by Japanese young scientists in the research of meson theory of nuclear forces. Chinese scientist Wu Shixu, on behalf of the Theoretical Physics Teaching and Research Room of Jilin University, presented a paper introducing their research on the calculation methods for nuclear many-body problems.

At the academic meeting of the Solid-State Physics Group, two Argentine scientists presented papers titled "Intermolecular Forces of Heavy Rare Gases" and "Optical Properties of Mixed Alkali Halide Crystals." Chinese scientist Xie Xide, on behalf of the Semiconductor Teaching and Research Group of the Physics Department and the Computational Mathematics Specialty of the Mathematics Department of Fudan University, presented a paper titled "Calculation of Semiconductor Electron Energy Bands." Their research work, if further results are obtained, may provide a certain theoretical basis for finding new semiconductor materials. Egyptian scientist Osman presented a paper co-authored with another Egyptian scientist titled "Improved Variable Internal Standard Spectral Analysis Method," proposing a simple method for analyzing petroleum ash.

At the academic meeting of the Physics Education Group, an Argentine scientist presented a paper titled "Methods of Popularizing Basic Science Education." Scientists from various countries discussed his paper.

New China News Agency, July 26th - The delegation of Cambodian scientists attending the Beijing Physics Symposium, led by Kim Chun, held a reception tonight to welcome the Chinese delegation of scientists.

During the reception, scientists from both countries exchanged greetings and toasted to the further development of unity and cooperation between scientists from the two countries and the friendship between the two peoples.

The delegation of Chinese scientists, led by Zhou Peiyuan, with deputy leaders Cai Zuxian, Qian Sanqiang, Zhu Hongyuan, and other members, were invited to attend the reception.

Kim Chun, the leader of the Cambodian delegation, said in his speech that the Cambodian delegation of scientists has noticed that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are advancing from one victory to another in various fields. He said, "When the U.S. imperialists tremble in the face of your achievements, we feel proud in your presence." He wished for the further development of friendly relations between scientists and peoples of Cambodia and China.

Zhou Peiyuan spoke at the reception. He said, "This physics symposium is a conference where the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania have stood up and taken science and culture into their own hands. The era when imperialism, old and new colonialism, and revisionism monopolized science and culture has passed." He said, "The Cambodian delegation of scientists not only brought the results of scientific research but also brought the fighting spirit of the Cambodian people against U.S. imperialism. Chinese scientists and the Chinese people will learn from the fighting spirit of the Cambodian people." He also expressed that Chinese scientists and people will stand together with Cambodian scientists and people to oppose their common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

The Cambodian Ambassador to China, Zhang Gang, also attended the reception and delivered an enthusiastic speech. He said, "China is Cambodia's number one friend, and the friendly cooperative relationship between the peoples and scientists of the two countries will definitely develop further."

Diplomatic officials from the Cambodian Embassy to China also attended the reception.

    我科学工作者关于基本粒子理论的学术报告引起普遍重视
    毛泽东思想光辉照亮科学实验的道路
    北京物理讨论会继续进行学术交流活动
    柬埔寨科学家代表团招待我国科学家代表团
    据新华社二十六日讯　中国物理学工作者汪容今天上午代表北京基本粒子理论组在北京物理讨论会全体会议上所作的一篇学术报告，再一次以雄辩的事实向人们指明：毛泽东思想是在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中战无不胜的强大武器。人们在科学实验中只要能够很好地掌握和运用这个武器，就一定能够充分发挥主观能动性，把精神力量转化成为巨大的物质力量。
    这篇题为《在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下研究基本粒子理论》的报告说明，参加北京基本粒子理论组研究工作的中国物理学工作者们，以毛泽东思想为武器，勇于实践，善于实践，深入虎穴，揭示矛盾，终于创造性地提出了反映基本粒子内部结构的“层子模型”理论，把基本粒子内部结构的理论研究向前推进了一大步。
    原子可分是本世纪初的重大发现，构成原子的基本粒子是否还有其内部结构，是否还可以再分，这已成为当代物理学研究的一个头等重要而又十分困难的课题。这个课题的突破，将使人们在认识客观物质世界及其运动规律的道路上大大前进一步。随着资本主义世界总危机的日益加深和西方资产阶级文化的日趋没落，实证主义和数学唯心主义思潮在基本粒子理论研究中广泛蔓延，一些西方资产阶级物理学“权威”或者不承认一百多种基本粒子内部还存在着更深入的阶层，或者不敢接触基本粒子内部结构这个本质问题。
    参加北京基本粒子理论组研究工作的中国物理学工作者们，活学活用毛主席著作，树立雄心壮志，决心赶超世界先进水平，长中国人民的志气，在向基本粒子内部领域的长征进军中当一名光荣的尖兵。他们遵循毛主席关于解放思想、破除迷信的教导，以毛主席的世界上一切事物都可以“一分为二”的光辉哲学思想作为最高指针，对近代物理学史作了周密的调查研究，系统地分析批判了资产阶级的唯心主义和形而上学观点对自然科学发展所造成的严重障碍，从而打破了迷信西方“权威”的旧框框，也批判地吸收了前人的研究成果。一年多来，在毛泽东思想的指引下，他们进行了大量的研究工作之后，终于提出了有关基本粒子内部结构的“层子模型”理论，指出基本粒子是由其内部更基本的东西即层子和反层子组成。同时，他们还提出了处理这种“层子模型”的新的理论计算方法。“层子”这个名词，是我国物理学工作者针对西方学者认为基本粒子不可再分的错误思想而提出的。“层”表示物质结构具有无限个层次，这意味着层子不是物质的始元。按照“层子模型”结构理论及其一套理论计算方法，可以解释和统一地描述旧有理论所无法解释和不能统一描述的基本粒子领域的很多现象，这对于今后进一步深入研究基本粒子内部结构是很有价值的。
    这篇报告还谈到，参加北京基本粒子理论组的中国科学工作者，百分之八十是青年。他们当中的许多人活学活用毛主席著作，树立为革命而进行科学研究的世界观，在科学实验中敢想，敢说，敢做，敢闯，敢革命，因此很快在研究工作中做出了贡献。
    中国物理学工作者的这篇报告，受到与会四大洲各国科学家的普遍重视。他们当中有的人对中国物理学工作者在毛泽东思想指引下所取得的重大成就表示热烈祝贺，有的高度赞扬中国青年科学工作者的迅速成长。还有的人从学术方面提出问题，同中国物理学工作者在十分融洽的气氛中进行进一步的探讨。
    在今天上午的全体会议上，日本科学家小川修三也作了一篇学术报告，题为《基本粒子理论的新发展——坂田模型”。小川修三在报告中比较全面地总结了日本物理学家坂田昌一一九五五年提出坂田模型以后的十年来，日本科学工作者在基本粒子理论方面作出的贡献。他的报告也受到了到会者的欢迎。
    今天下午，各国科学家继续分组举行学术会议，宣读论文或者进行学术讨论。
    在基本粒子组学术会议上，各国科学家就中国物理学工作者今天上午所作的学术报告和昨天宣读的三篇有关“层子模型”的论文，进行了热烈的讨论。在讨论中，日本青年物理学家大场一郎和井町昌弘分别作了专题性的发言，介绍了他们在基本粒子研究方面的一些情况。
    在原子核物理组学术会议上，日本科学家池田清美宣读的论文，对原子核衰变方面的一些现象作了解释。日本青年科学工作者广重升的论文，介绍了日本青年科学工作者在核力的介子理论研究方面所做的工作。中国科学工作者吴式枢代表吉林大学理论物理教研室宣读的论文，介绍了他们对核多体问题的计算方法所作的研究。
    在固体物理组学术会议上，阿根廷的两位科学家，分别宣读了题为《重稀有气体分子间力》和《混合碱卤化合物晶体的光学性质》的两篇论文。中国科学工作者谢希德代表复旦大学物理系半导体教研组和数学系计算数学专业，宣读了题为《半导体电子能带计算》的论文。他们的研究工作如获得进一步的结果，有可能为寻找新的半导体材料提供一定的理论根据。阿联科学家奥斯曼在会上宣读了他和阿联另外一位科学家合作写的一篇题为《改进可变内标光谱分析方法》的论文，提出了一种分析石油灰份的简便方法。
    在物理教学组学术会议上，阿根廷科学家宣读了题为《基础科学的普及教育方法》的论文。各国科学家就他的论文进行了讨论。
    新华社二十六日讯　参加北京物理讨论会的柬埔寨科学家代表团团长吉春今晚举行招待会，招待中国科学家代表团。
    席间，两国科学家相叙，共祝中柬两国科学家的团结合作和两国人民的友谊日益发展。
    中国科学家代表团团长周培源、副团长蔡祖泉，代表团团员钱三强、朱洪元等应邀出席招待会。
    吉春团长在招待会上讲话说，柬埔寨科学家代表团注意到中国人民在各个领域中掌握毛泽东思想从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。他说，当美帝国主义在你们的成就面前发抖的时候，我们在你们的面前感到自豪。他祝柬埔寨、中国两国科学家和两国人民之间的友好关系进一步发展。
    周培源在招待会上讲了话。他说，这次物理讨论会，是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲人民站起来把科学文化掌握在自己手里的会议。现在，帝国主义、新老殖民主义、修正主义垄断科学文化的时代一去不复返了。他说，柬埔寨科学家代表团不但带来了科学研究的成果，也带来柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义的斗争精神，中国科学家和中国人民将学习柬埔寨人民这种斗争精神。他还表示中国科学家和人民将同柬埔寨科学家和人民一起反对共同的敌人美帝国主义。
    柬埔寨驻中国大使张岗也出席了招待会，并发表了热情的讲话，他说，中国是柬埔寨的第一号朋友，柬中两国人民和科学家之间的友好合作关系一定会得到更大的发展。
    柬埔寨驻中国大使馆的外交官员也出席了招待会。
