	Xi'an, July 24 -- A rally and parade involving 500,000 people from various sectors of Xi'an was held today. The participants solemnly declared that the people of Xi'an, like the people of the entire nation, are ready to make any sacrifice and pay any price to resolutely support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression for national salvation until they achieve final victory.

	Hu Xiqiu and Wang Fu, members of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Northwest Bureau, Yan Kelun, a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China's Shaanxi Provincial Committee, Liu Bangxian, Vice Governor of Shaanxi Province, Peng Tianqi, Second Secretary of the Communist Party of China's Xi'an Municipal Committee, and other party and government leaders, military leaders, as well as leaders from the provincial and municipal people's political consultative conferences, various people's organizations, and various democratic parties, participated in the rally and parade. Deng Zhongshi, an employee of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's embassy in China, and all Vietnamese students and interns in the Xi'an area, as well as foreign friends visiting Xi'an, were invited to attend the meeting.

	Xu Bu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China's Xi'an Municipal Committee and Mayor of Xi'an, spoke at the meeting. He expressed the firm support of the people of Xi'an from all sectors for Chairman Liu Shaoqi's solemn declaration and Chairman Hu's "Letter to All Compatriots." Xu Bu said: Chairman Mao pointed out, "When we say 'imperialism is very ferocious,' it means that its nature is unchangeable. Imperialists will never lay down their butcher's knives, and they will never become Buddhas until their demise." The U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is a desperate struggle in the face of being beaten black and blue and having nowhere to turn by the Vietnamese people. We, together with the people of the entire nation, are prepared to make the greatest national sacrifices to support the Vietnamese people in their victory over U.S. imperialism.

	Nguyen Thanh Vu, a representative of Vietnamese students and interns, was invited to speak at the meeting. Nguyen Thanh Vu said, "We Vietnamese people all deeply understand that the only way to deal with U.S. imperialism is to fight, to fight until it suffers a crushing defeat and is completely and thoroughly driven out of Vietnam."

	Wang Boyuan, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, spoke on behalf of various people's organizations and democratic parties.

	After the meeting, a grand parade was held.
