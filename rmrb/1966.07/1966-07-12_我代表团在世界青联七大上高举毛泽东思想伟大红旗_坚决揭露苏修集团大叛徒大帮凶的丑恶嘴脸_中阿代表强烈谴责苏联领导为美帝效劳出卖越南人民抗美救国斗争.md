Our delegation at the Seventh World Youth and Students Festival held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We resolutely exposed the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist group of big traitors and big henchmen. Chinese and Albanian representatives strongly condemned the Soviet leadership for serving the U.S. empire and betraying the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, the head of the Chinese youth delegation participating in the Seventh Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: At this congress, the Chinese youth delegation held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary banner of opposing U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. Together with other representatives who insist on anti-imperialism and revolution, we engaged in a head-to-head struggle with the Soviet youth organization leaders who promote a line of capitulationism and splitism within the World Federation of Democratic Youth, achieving significant victories.

This congress was held from June 6th to 17th in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria.

The head of the Chinese youth delegation said that due to the resolute and powerful struggle of China, Albania, and other youth organizations that insist on anti-imperialism and revolution, the ugly face of the Soviet modern revisionist group as a great traitor and big henchman of the world's revolutionary people was fully exposed. The fraud of the "united action" advocated by the Soviet delegation was also thoroughly exposed.

Most of the representatives attending the conference expressed indignation at the Soviet youth organization leaders manipulating the conference to further promote the line of capitulation and splitism of the Soviet leadership, frenziedly anti-China, and implementing extremely barbaric fascist methods.

The head of the Chinese delegation said that as soon as the conference began, the Chinese delegation proposed that the establishment and development of a world youth anti-U.S. united front be made a topic of the conference. However, the conference manipulators did not dare to discuss this issue and immediately started the voting machine to reject the reasonable proposal of the Chinese delegation. After the conference entered the general discussion, the struggle between the two lines became even more intense. On the morning of the 9th, the head of the Chinese delegation, Li Wenyao, spoke, citing a large number of irrefutable facts to point out: U.S. imperialism is currently shifting the focus of its counter-revolutionary global strategy from Europe to Asia and, together with Japanese militarism, the Indian reactionaries, and others, is building a "wall to contain China" around China. The Soviet modern revisionists, in close cooperation with U.S. imperialism, have degenerated into henchmen of U.S. imperialism. Throughout the activities of modern revisionism, there is a black line: the general line of Sino-U.S. cooperation to dominate the world. Their so-called "united action" on the Vietnam issue is to cooperate with U.S. imperialism to bring the Vietnam issue into the track of Sino-U.S. cooperation, sabotaging the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. struggle.

When Li Wenyao spoke, the Soviet delegation was like sitting on pins and needles, enraged and angry, staging an unprecedented anti-China farce in the history of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The Soviet representatives and their lackeys used vile tactics such as stomping feet, howling, banging tables, and cutting off microphones to repeatedly interrupt the speech of the Chinese delegation, making the entire venue chaotic and smoky. The Soviet delegation finally resorted to fascist barbarism, instructing the conference chairman to forcibly deprive the Chinese delegation of their right to speak and announce a recess, attempting to silence the voice of the 130 million Chinese youth representatives.

After the resumption, the Chinese delegation issued a statement strongly protesting the anti-China farce carefully planned by the Soviet delegation and sternly pointing out to the Soviet delegation: You do not dare to listen to our speech, which only shows your extreme weakness. The Albanian delegation also strongly protested the deprivation of the Chinese delegation's right to speak. Representatives from Guyana, the Dominican "June 14th" Revolutionary Movement, and others expressed regret over the anti-China farce staged by the conference manipulators. Many representatives below the conference expressed, "The conference is too barbaric, completely undemocratic," "Your speech is very powerful and good, speaking the truth," "They fear the truth, but the truth is indestructible."

During the general discussion at the conference, the head of the Albanian delegation, Akim Merro, severely criticized the Soviet modern revisionists for acting as henchmen and running dogs of U.S. imperialism and betraying the proletarian revolution. Merro said, "Life itself has taught our youth to recognize the enemy, even when they wear various masks."

The Indonesian representative, Udoyo, refuted the fallacies of "peaceful coexistence" and "peaceful transition" based on the facts of the reactionary coup d'Ã©tat launched by the right-wing military clique in Indonesia, pointing out that spreading these fallacies means helping imperialism. Udoyo emphasized, "At a time when the progressive forces of Indonesia are facing serious difficulties, some fake revolutionaries slander the progressive people of Indonesia, especially the communists, saying that the difficulties they are facing now are due to their insistence on the so-called Beijing dogmatism line and their refusal to implement the fake revolutionary line of modern revisionism. We resolutely reject this slander."

The head of the Soviet delegation, Pavlov, tried to play tricks with fake anti-imperialism, fake aid to Vietnam, and fake unity, while maliciously insinuating and attacking China as "splitism" and "hegemony."

The Chinese representative immediately made a situational speech, pointing out that Pavlov, over the years, has used activities organized or supported by the World Federation of Democratic Youth to frenziedly attack China and support the Soviet authorities in brutally suppressing Vietnamese, Chinese, and other Asian, African, and Latin American students who held anti-U.S. demonstrations. The facts show that the so-called "united action" advocated by the Soviet representative is to unite with U.S. imperialism to oppose the revolution of China and other countries. Under the stern reproach of the Chinese representative, the Soviet representative was caught off guard and dared not respond.

The head of the Chinese delegation pointed out that when the conference entered the small group discussion stage, there was also a sharp struggle between the two lines in each small group. At the special small group meeting on the Vietnam issue, the Chinese representative pointed out that to more effectively support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, it is necessary to thoroughly expose the conspiracy of "peace talks" plotted by U.S. imperialism and its henchmen and thoroughly expose the behavior of Soviet revisionism's fake support and true betrayal and their fraud of the so-called "united action." The Albanian representative supported the opinion of China. The Albanian representative also pointed out, "Either stand on the side of the Vietnamese people or stand on the side of U.S. imperialism, one of the two must be chosen." "The Soviet revisionists claim to be friends of Vietnam but stand with the enemy of the Vietnamese people, U.S. imperialism, actually engaging in Sino-U.S. cooperation."

The head of the Chinese delegation pointed out that in the final stage of the conference when various resolutions were passed, the struggle between the two lines reached its climax. During the discussion on the resolution on the Vietnam issue, the Chinese representative proposed two specific amendments: "1. The conference exposes the henchmen of U.S. imperialism who conspire with the U.S. to plot the 'peace talks' conspiracy, attempting to bring the Vietnam issue into their track of cooperation with the United States. 2. The conference condemns the U.S. imperialists' arrogant plan to expand the war in Vietnam to the entire Indochina and China, and points out that anyone who uses the issue of aid to Vietnam to oppose China is helping U.S. imperialism expand the war in Vietnam." The Soviet delegation manipulated the conference, unreasonably rejected the amendments proposed by the Chinese delegation without discussion. The Chinese delegation immediately issued an oral statement, giving a severe condemnation. The Chinese delegation voted in favor of the resolution on the Vietnam issue with reservations and voted in favor of other resolutions supporting the national independence movement with reservations because they did not clearly condemn the henchmen and running dogs of U.S. imperialism.

During the discussion on the draft action program of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, many representatives proposed a series of criticisms and amendments. The conference manipulators started the voting machine, forcibly passing a procedural motion to stop the discussion and immediately vote on the entire document, which sparked a wave of protests in the venue. Twenty-two delegations voted against this procedural motion, and fourteen delegations issued statements, strongly condemning this undemocratic method. When voting on the action program, the representatives of China, Albania, Guyana, the Dominican "June 14th" Revolutionary Movement, Vietnam, South Vietnam, Japan, the Netherlands, Indonesia, and North Korea voted against, abstained, or did not participate in the vote.

The general resolution was passed under the manipulators' usual tactic of sudden attack. The Chinese and Albanian delegations exposed the errors of the general resolution and voted against it. Nine delegations, including Guyana, Venezuela, Vietnam, South Vietnam, Japan, North Korea, and the Netherlands, abstained, and Indonesia did not participate in the vote.

The manipulators also forcibly passed a so-called "resolution on France's nuclear tests in the South Pacific." This resolution did not condemn the main threat of nuclear warâU.S. imperialism but, under the pretext of opposing French nuclear tests, attacked all countries that did not sign the partial nuclear test ban treaty among the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union. This resolution was exposed and opposed by the representatives of China, Albania, Vietnam, North Korea, and Puerto Rico.

The head of the Chinese youth delegation finally pointed out that the Soviet leadership is in a state of internal and external difficulties, and their weak nature was once again exposed at this conference. The Chinese delegation issued a statement at the closing of the conference, pointing out: "In recent years, the Chinese youth organization, together with revolutionary organizations from various countries that insist on anti-imperialism, has, in order to maintain the correct direction of the international youth movement, engaged in an unremitting struggle against the line of capitulationism and splitism promoted by the Soviet youth organization leaders within the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The facts have proven that what we have done is completely necessary and in line with the fundamental interests of the world's anti-imperialist revolutionary youth. The Chinese youth will always adhere to this principle and, together with the revolutionary youth of various countries who oppose imperialism, carry on the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs and henchmen to the end."
