Our delegation at the Seventh World Youth and Students Festival held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We resolutely exposed the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist group of big traitors and big henchmen. Chinese and Albanian representatives strongly condemned the Soviet leadership for serving the U.S. empire and betraying the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, the head of the Chinese youth delegation participating in the Seventh Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: At this congress, the Chinese youth delegation held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary banner of opposing U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. Together with other representatives who insist on anti-imperialism and revolution, we engaged in a head-to-head struggle with the Soviet youth organization leaders who promote a line of capitulationism and splitism within the World Federation of Democratic Youth, achieving significant victories.

This congress was held from June 6th to 17th in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria.

The head of the Chinese youth delegation said that due to the resolute and powerful struggle of China, Albania, and other youth organizations that insist on anti-imperialism and revolution, the ugly face of the Soviet modern revisionist group as a great traitor and big henchman of the world's revolutionary people was fully exposed. The fraud of the "united action" advocated by the Soviet delegation was also thoroughly exposed.

Most of the representatives attending the conference expressed indignation at the Soviet youth organization leaders manipulating the conference to further promote the line of capitulation and splitism of the Soviet leadership, frenziedly anti-China, and implementing extremely barbaric fascist methods.

The head of the Chinese delegation said that as soon as the conference began, the Chinese delegation proposed that the establishment and development of a world youth anti-U.S. united front be made a topic of the conference. However, the conference manipulators did not dare to discuss this issue and immediately started the voting machine to reject the reasonable proposal of the Chinese delegation. After the conference entered the general discussion, the struggle between the two lines became even more intense. On the morning of the 9th, the head of the Chinese delegation, Li Wenyao, spoke, citing a large number of irrefutable facts to point out: U.S. imperialism is currently shifting the focus of its counter-revolutionary global strategy from Europe to Asia and, together with Japanese militarism, the Indian reactionaries, and others, is building a "wall to contain China" around China. The Soviet modern revisionists, in close cooperation with U.S. imperialism, have degenerated into henchmen of U.S. imperialism. Throughout the activities of modern revisionism, there is a black line: the general line of Sino-U.S. cooperation to dominate the world. Their so-called "united action" on the Vietnam issue is to cooperate with U.S. imperialism to bring the Vietnam issue into the track of Sino-U.S. cooperation, sabotaging the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. struggle.

When Li Wenyao spoke, the Soviet delegation was like sitting on pins and needles, enraged and angry, staging an unprecedented anti-China farce in the history of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The Soviet representatives and their lackeys used vile tactics such as stomping feet, howling, banging tables, and cutting off microphones to repeatedly interrupt the speech of the Chinese delegation, making the entire venue chaotic and smoky. The Soviet delegation finally resorted to fascist barbarism, instructing the conference chairman to forcibly deprive the Chinese delegation of their right to speak and announce a recess, attempting to silence the voice of the 130 million Chinese youth representatives.

After the resumption, the Chinese delegation issued a statement strongly protesting the anti-China farce carefully planned by the Soviet delegation and sternly pointing out to the Soviet delegation: You do not dare to listen to our speech, which only shows your extreme weakness. The Albanian delegation also strongly protested the deprivation of the Chinese delegation's right to speak. Representatives from Guyana, the Dominican "June 14th" Revolutionary Movement, and others expressed regret over the anti-China farce staged by the conference manipulators. Many representatives below the conference expressed, "The conference is too barbaric, completely undemocratic," "Your speech is very powerful and good, speaking the truth," "They fear the truth, but the truth is indestructible."

During the general discussion at the conference, the head of the Albanian delegation, Akim Merro, severely criticized the Soviet modern revisionists for acting as henchmen and running dogs of U.S. imperialism and betraying the proletarian revolution. Merro said, "Life itself has taught our youth to recognize the enemy, even when they wear various masks."

The Indonesian representative, Udoyo, refuted the fallacies of "peaceful coexistence" and "peaceful transition" based on the facts of the reactionary coup d'état launched by the right-wing military clique in Indonesia, pointing out that spreading these fallacies means helping imperialism. Udoyo emphasized, "At a time when the progressive forces of Indonesia are facing serious difficulties, some fake revolutionaries slander the progressive people of Indonesia, especially the communists, saying that the difficulties they are facing now are due to their insistence on the so-called Beijing dogmatism line and their refusal to implement the fake revolutionary line of modern revisionism. We resolutely reject this slander."

The head of the Soviet delegation, Pavlov, tried to play tricks with fake anti-imperialism, fake aid to Vietnam, and fake unity, while maliciously insinuating and attacking China as "splitism" and "hegemony."

The Chinese representative immediately made a situational speech, pointing out that Pavlov, over the years, has used activities organized or supported by the World Federation of Democratic Youth to frenziedly attack China and support the Soviet authorities in brutally suppressing Vietnamese, Chinese, and other Asian, African, and Latin American students who held anti-U.S. demonstrations. The facts show that the so-called "united action" advocated by the Soviet representative is to unite with U.S. imperialism to oppose the revolution of China and other countries. Under the stern reproach of the Chinese representative, the Soviet representative was caught off guard and dared not respond.

The head of the Chinese delegation pointed out that when the conference entered the small group discussion stage, there was also a sharp struggle between the two lines in each small group. At the special small group meeting on the Vietnam issue, the Chinese representative pointed out that to more effectively support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, it is necessary to thoroughly expose the conspiracy of "peace talks" plotted by U.S. imperialism and its henchmen and thoroughly expose the behavior of Soviet revisionism's fake support and true betrayal and their fraud of the so-called "united action." The Albanian representative supported the opinion of China. The Albanian representative also pointed out, "Either stand on the side of the Vietnamese people or stand on the side of U.S. imperialism, one of the two must be chosen." "The Soviet revisionists claim to be friends of Vietnam but stand with the enemy of the Vietnamese people, U.S. imperialism, actually engaging in Sino-U.S. cooperation."

The head of the Chinese delegation pointed out that in the final stage of the conference when various resolutions were passed, the struggle between the two lines reached its climax. During the discussion on the resolution on the Vietnam issue, the Chinese representative proposed two specific amendments: "1. The conference exposes the henchmen of U.S. imperialism who conspire with the U.S. to plot the 'peace talks' conspiracy, attempting to bring the Vietnam issue into their track of cooperation with the United States. 2. The conference condemns the U.S. imperialists' arrogant plan to expand the war in Vietnam to the entire Indochina and China, and points out that anyone who uses the issue of aid to Vietnam to oppose China is helping U.S. imperialism expand the war in Vietnam." The Soviet delegation manipulated the conference, unreasonably rejected the amendments proposed by the Chinese delegation without discussion. The Chinese delegation immediately issued an oral statement, giving a severe condemnation. The Chinese delegation voted in favor of the resolution on the Vietnam issue with reservations and voted in favor of other resolutions supporting the national independence movement with reservations because they did not clearly condemn the henchmen and running dogs of U.S. imperialism.

During the discussion on the draft action program of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, many representatives proposed a series of criticisms and amendments. The conference manipulators started the voting machine, forcibly passing a procedural motion to stop the discussion and immediately vote on the entire document, which sparked a wave of protests in the venue. Twenty-two delegations voted against this procedural motion, and fourteen delegations issued statements, strongly condemning this undemocratic method. When voting on the action program, the representatives of China, Albania, Guyana, the Dominican "June 14th" Revolutionary Movement, Vietnam, South Vietnam, Japan, the Netherlands, Indonesia, and North Korea voted against, abstained, or did not participate in the vote.

The general resolution was passed under the manipulators' usual tactic of sudden attack. The Chinese and Albanian delegations exposed the errors of the general resolution and voted against it. Nine delegations, including Guyana, Venezuela, Vietnam, South Vietnam, Japan, North Korea, and the Netherlands, abstained, and Indonesia did not participate in the vote.

The manipulators also forcibly passed a so-called "resolution on France's nuclear tests in the South Pacific." This resolution did not condemn the main threat of nuclear war—U.S. imperialism but, under the pretext of opposing French nuclear tests, attacked all countries that did not sign the partial nuclear test ban treaty among the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union. This resolution was exposed and opposed by the representatives of China, Albania, Vietnam, North Korea, and Puerto Rico.

The head of the Chinese youth delegation finally pointed out that the Soviet leadership is in a state of internal and external difficulties, and their weak nature was once again exposed at this conference. The Chinese delegation issued a statement at the closing of the conference, pointing out: "In recent years, the Chinese youth organization, together with revolutionary organizations from various countries that insist on anti-imperialism, has, in order to maintain the correct direction of the international youth movement, engaged in an unremitting struggle against the line of capitulationism and splitism promoted by the Soviet youth organization leaders within the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The facts have proven that what we have done is completely necessary and in line with the fundamental interests of the world's anti-imperialist revolutionary youth. The Chinese youth will always adhere to this principle and, together with the revolutionary youth of various countries who oppose imperialism, carry on the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs and henchmen to the end."

　　我代表团在世界青联七大上高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
　　坚决揭露苏修集团大叛徒大帮凶的丑恶嘴脸
　　中阿代表强烈谴责苏联领导为美帝效劳出卖越南人民抗美救国斗争
    据新华社十一日讯　参加世界民主青年联盟第七次代表大会的中国青年代表团负责人，向新华社记者发表谈话指出：在这次大会上，中国青年代表团高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举反对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的革命旗帜，与其他坚持反帝、坚持革命的代表一起，同在世界青联中推行投降主义、分裂主义路线的苏联青年组织领导人进行了针锋相对的斗争，取得了重大胜利。
      这次代表大会从六月六日到十七日在保加利亚首都索非亚举行。
    中国青年代表团负责人说，由于中国、阿尔巴尼亚和其他坚持反帝、坚持革命的青年组织的坚决有力的斗争，苏联现代修正主义集团作为世界革命人民的大叛徒、美帝国主义大帮凶的丑恶嘴脸被充分揭露，苏联代表团竭力鼓吹的“联合行动”的骗局也被彻底戳穿。
      参加会议的多数代表对苏联青年组织领导人操纵大会进一步推行苏联领导集团的投降、分裂路线，疯狂地反华，并实行极其野蛮的法西斯作法，表示愤慨。
      中国代表团负责人说，会议一开始，中国代表团就建议把建立和发展世界青年反美统一战线问题作为大会的一个议题。但是，会议操纵者根本不敢就这个问题进行讨论就开动表决机器，否决了中国代表团的合理建议。大会进入一般性讨论后，两条路线的斗争更加激烈。九日上午，中国代表团团长李文耀发言，引用大量的无可辩驳的事实指出：美帝国主义当前把反革命全球战略的重心从欧洲转移到亚洲，并伙同日本军国主义、印度反动派等，在中国周围建立一道“遏制中国的墙”。而苏联现代修正主义与美帝国主义密切配合，已堕落成为美帝国主义的帮凶。在现代修正主义全部活动中贯穿着一条黑线，即苏美合作主宰世界的总路线。他们在越南问题上所说的“联合行动”就是同美帝国主义联合把越南问题纳入苏美合作的轨道，破坏越南人民的反美斗争。
    李文耀发言时，苏联代表团如坐针毡，恼羞成怒，导演了一场世界民主青年联盟历史上空前的反华大丑剧。苏联代表以及他们的娄罗们，采用跺脚、嗥叫、拍桌子、切断麦克风等恶劣行径，多次打断中国代表团的发言，使整个会场乌烟瘴气，乱成一团。苏联代表团最后还采取法西斯野蛮手段，指使大会执行主席，强行剥夺了中国代表团的发言权，并且宣布休会，企图堵住一亿三千万中国青年的代表的声音。
    复会后，中国代表团发表声明，对苏联代表团精心策划的这场反华丑剧提出强烈抗议，并向苏联代表团严正指出：你们没有胆量听取我们的发言，这只能说明你们极端虚弱。阿尔巴尼亚代表团对剥夺中国代表团发言权的作法也表示了强烈的抗议。圭亚那、多米尼加“六月十四日”革命运动组织等代表对会议操纵者导演的反华丑剧表示遗憾。会下许多代表纷纷向中
  国代表团表示，“会议太野蛮，完全是反民主的”，“你们发言很有力、很好，讲了真理”，“他们害怕真理，但真理总是真理，是损害不了的。”
    在大会一般讨论中，阿尔巴尼亚代表团团长阿基姆·梅罗在发言中严厉指责了苏联现代修正主义充当美帝国主义的帮凶和走狗，叛变了无产阶级革命。梅罗说：“生活本身使我国青年学会了很好地认识敌人，即使他们带着各种面具。”
    印度尼西亚代表乌多约在发言中根据印度尼西亚右派军人集团发动反动政变的事实，有力地批驳了“和平共处”、“和平过渡”的谬论，指出散布这些谬论意味着帮帝国主义的忙。乌多约着重指出：“正当印度尼西亚的进步力量面临严重困难的时候，某些假革命者诬蔑印度尼西亚进步人士、特别是共产党员，说他们现在遇到的困难是由于他们坚持所谓北京教条主义路线和由于他们拒绝实行假革命的现代修正主义路线。我们断然拒绝这种诬蔑。”
    苏联代表团团长巴甫洛夫在发言中，竭力玩弄假反帝、假援越、假团结的手法，同时恶毒影射攻击中国是“分裂主义”、“霸权主义”。
    中国代表立即作情况发言，指出巴甫洛夫几年来利用世界民主青年联盟举办或支持的一些活动疯狂反华，支持苏联当局血腥镇压举行反美示威的越南、中国和其它亚非拉国家留学生。事实正好说明：苏联代表叫嚷的所谓“联合行动”，就是要联合美帝国主义，反对中国和其它国家的革命。在中国代表的严正斥责之下，苏联代表窘态毕露，根本不敢作答。
    中国代表团负责人指出，在大会结束一般讨论进入小组会阶段时，各小组会同样存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争。在越南问题特别小组会上，中国代表指出，要更有效地支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，就必须彻底揭露美帝国主义及其帮凶策划的
  “和谈”阴谋，彻底揭露苏联修正主义的假支持、真出卖的行为和他们叫嚷的所谓“联合行动”的骗局。阿尔巴尼亚代表支持中国的意见。阿尔巴尼亚代表还指出：“或者是站在越南人民一边，或者是站在美帝国主义一边，二者必居其一。”“苏联修正主义者自称是越南的朋友，却又同越南人民的敌人美帝国主义站在一起，实际上是搞苏美合作。”
    中国代表团负责人指出，在会议最后阶段通过各项决议时，两条路线的斗争达到了高潮。在讨论越南问题决议时，中国代表提出两条具体修正案：“一、大会揭露美帝国主义的帮凶配合美帝策划‘和谈’阴谋，妄图把越南问题纳入他们同美国合作的轨道。二、大会谴责美帝国主义妄图把侵越战争扩大到整个印度支那和中国的狂妄计划，并指出凡是利用援越问题反对中国都是帮助美帝国主义扩大侵越战争。”苏联代表团操纵会议，不经过讨论就无理否决了中国代表团提出的修正案。中国代表团当即发表口头声明，给以严厉的谴责。中国代表团对越南问题决议投了有保留的赞成票，对其他支持民族独立运动的分决议，由于其中没有明确谴责美帝国主义的帮凶和走狗，也投了有保留的赞成票。
    在讨论世界民主青年联盟行动纲领草案时，许多代表提出了一系列批评和修正案。会议操纵者开动表决机器，强行通过了制止讨论、要立刻对整个文件进行表决的程序动议，在会场上激起了一片抗议声。有二十二个代表团对这个程序动议投了反对票，十四个代表团发表了声明，强烈谴责这种反民主的手法。在表决行动纲领时，中国、阿尔巴尼亚、圭亚那、多米尼加“六月十四日”革命运动组织的代表投了反对票，越南、越南南方、日本、荷兰的代表投了弃权票，印度尼西亚、朝鲜的代表不参加投票。
    大会总决议是在会议操纵者施展了他们惯用的突然袭击的手法下通过的。中国和阿尔巴尼亚代表团揭露了总决议的错误，对它投了反对票。圭亚那、委内瑞拉、越南、越南南方、日本、朝鲜、荷兰等九个代表团弃权，印度尼西亚不参加投票。
    会议操纵者还强行通过了一个所谓“关于法国在南太平洋的核试验”的决议。这个决议根本不谴责核战争的主要威胁——美帝国主义，却借反对法国核试验之名，攻击所有不在美、英、苏三国部分禁止核试验条约上签字的国家，并要求实现旨在巩固苏、美两大国的核垄断的所谓“防止核扩散”。这个决议遭到了中国、阿尔巴尼亚、越南、朝鲜、波多黎各代表的揭露和反对。
    中国青年代表团负责人最后指出，苏联领导集团正处在内外交困之中，他们的虚弱本质在这次大会上又一次明显地暴露出来。中国代表团在会议闭幕时发表声明指出：“中国青年组织几年来同各国坚持反帝的革命组织一起，为了维护国际青年运动的正确方向，同苏联青年组织领导人在世界民主青年联盟执行的投降、分裂主义路线进行了坚持不懈的斗争。事实证明，我们这样做完全是必要的，是符合世界反帝革命青年的根本利益的。中国青年将永远坚持这个原则立场，同各国反对帝国主义的革命的青年一起，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶的斗争进行到底。”
