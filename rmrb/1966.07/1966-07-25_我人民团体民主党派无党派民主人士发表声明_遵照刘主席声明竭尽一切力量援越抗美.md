	Chinese People's Organizations, Democratic Parties, and Non-Partisan Democrats Issue Statement
	Fully Support Chairman Liu's Statement to Spare No Effort in Aiding Vietnam and Resisting America

	Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee Non-Partisan Democrats

	Xinhua News Agency, July 24th — The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee Non-Partisan Democrats issued a statement today saying that the great declaration by Comrade Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, "Message to the Nation," is a powerful blow to the U.S. imperialists' plot of "bombing for the sake of negotiations"; it is a stern rebuke to the Soviet revisionist leadership, which is the number one accomplice in the U.S. imperialists' "negotiation" fraud, as well as to the Indian Prime Minister, the British Prime Minister, and other conspirators. The statement said, we firmly believe that the heroic Vietnamese people, with their glorious anti-imperialist tradition, will surely defeat the U.S. aggressors and drive the U.S. bandits out of Vietnam, not leaving a single one behind.

	The statement said, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the 700 million Chinese people, issued a solemn declaration to the world on July 22nd. We will definitely follow Chairman Liu Shaoqi's declaration, resolutely stand with the people of the entire country, and spare no effort to support and aid the Vietnamese people until they achieve final victory.

	The statement said, U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger that appears strong. The U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is a sign of their desperate struggle. The statement said, regardless of whether the U.S. imperialists adopt maddened war "escalation" or play the "negotiation" trick, the heroic Vietnamese people will not be frightened or deceived. The U.S. imperialists will inevitably meet their doomed failure.

	The statement said, the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression is not only for defending the independence and freedom of the Vietnamese people but also a significant support for the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Justice is on the side of the Vietnamese people, and all revolutionary peoples of the world stand with the Vietnamese people.

	China Democratic League

	Xinhua News Agency, July 24th — The Central Committee of the China Democratic League issued a statement today saying that Comrade Liu Shaoqi's solemn declaration to the world expresses the wishes of all 700 million Chinese people. The statement said, all members of the China Democratic League enthusiastically and resolutely support Comrade Liu Shaoqi's declaration and Comrade Zhu De's telegram to Comrade Long Cheng.

	The statement said, Comrade Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, "Message to the Nation" and the order to mobilize part of the reserve forces are solemn vows representing the 31 million Vietnamese people, expressing the Vietnamese people's determination to carry the anti-American national salvation struggle to the end, and expressing the Vietnamese people's unshakable confidence in decisive victory. The U.S. aggressors will only meet with complete failure and complete ruin in front of such a great and heroic people.

	The statement said, under the wise leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, all members of the China Democratic League will definitely stand with the people of the entire country, unite as one, and contribute all our strength to aid Vietnam and resist America.

	China Democratic National Construction Association

	Xinhua News Agency, July 24th — The China Democratic National Construction Association issued a statement today saying that the China Democratic National Construction Association will definitely, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, stand with all the people of China, follow the declarations issued by the Chinese government on July 3rd and by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on July 22nd, respond to all calls by our government, and most resolutely support the heroic Vietnamese people in carrying their just struggle of national salvation against U.S. aggression to the end and achieving final victory.

	The China Democratic National Construction Association expressed in the statement its most resolute support for Comrade Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, "Message to the Nation." The statement said, the Vietnamese people have great determination and fight well. They are steadfast warriors standing at the forefront of the world's anti-imperialist struggle. They bravely defended their country's independence and powerfully maintained world peace, making a tremendous contribution to the anti-imperialist struggle and revolutionary cause of all peoples of the world. The statement said, the China Democratic National Construction Association expresses the highest respect for the Vietnamese people's iron will in national salvation against U.S. aggression.

	The China Democratic National Construction Association exposed in the statement the U.S. imperialists' plot of "bombing for the sake of negotiations" and severely condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership and those ghosts and snakes who conspired with the U.S. imperialists to create the "negotiation" fraud, serving the U.S. imperialists.

	China Zhi Gong Party

	Xinhua News Agency, July 24th — The Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party announced today that all members of the China Zhi Gong Party must unite more closely around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, under the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely stand with the people of the entire country, stand on the side of the Vietnamese people, and fully support the Vietnamese people's struggle of national salvation against U.S. aggression until they achieve final victory.

	The Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party issued a statement today saying that Comrade Liu Shaoqi, in his declaration representing the 700 million Chinese people, solemnly reaffirmed: U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam is aggression against China. The 700 million Chinese people are the steadfast rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. The China Zhi Gong Party most resolutely supports Comrade Liu Shaoqi's declaration.

	The statement, when discussing the four declarations recently issued by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, including Comrade Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, "Message to the Nation," pointed out that these four declarations express the just voice of the 31 million Vietnamese people and reflect the Vietnamese people's firm determination to fight to the end. The China Zhi Gong Party expresses limitless admiration and most resolute support for this.

	The statement pointed out that facts have fully proven that the U.S. imperialists are more cruel and barbaric than Hitler. The statement also severely condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for playing the role of the number one accomplice of the U.S. imperialists in the Johnson administration's plot of "bombing for the sake of negotiations," attempting to realize the wild ambition of "Sino-American cooperation to rule the world." The statement pointed out that this fact further exposed the Soviet revisionist leadership's traitorous face of false aid and true betrayal to the Vietnamese people's struggle of national salvation against U.S. aggression.

	The statement finally expressed its firm belief that the Vietnamese people's just cause of resolutely fighting against U.S. imperialist aggression for the independence, freedom, and unity of the nation and people will surely achieve final victory.

	All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce

	Xinhua News Agency, July 24th — The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a statement today saying that all industrialists and businesspeople of the entire country must, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, stand with the people of the entire country and spare no effort to support the Vietnamese people's just struggle of national salvation against U.S. aggression.

	The statement expressed its resolute support for Comrade Liu Shaoqi's declaration and Comrade Zhu De's telegram to Comrade Long Cheng, and resolute support for Comrade Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, "Message to the Nation" and the order to mobilize part of the reserve forces.

	The statement severely condemned the U.S. imperialists for, in order to get out of the situation of being on the verge of collapse on the battlefield in South Vietnam, brazenly bombing the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the second-largest city, Haiphong, in an attempt to realize their evil plot of "bombing for the sake of negotiations." Any war "escalation" by the U.S. imperialists will absolutely not frighten the Vietnamese people, and any "negotiation" trick will also not deceive the Vietnamese people, but will only further ignite the Vietnamese people's will to struggle for national salvation against U.S. aggression. Chairman Mao said: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are ruined—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." The U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam will also not deviate from this logic.

	The statement also severely condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for playing the role of the number one accomplice in the U.S. imperialists' evil activities of "bombing for the sake of negotiations." The statement said, Comrade Ho Chi Minh's "Message to the Nation" sternly called for exposing the U.S. imperialists' "negotiation" fraud and is also a stern rebuke to those who conspired with the U.S. imperialists to create the "negotiation" fraud. The Soviet revisionist leadership's various tricks will absolutely not save the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression from its doomed complete failure, but will only further expose its traitorous face of betraying the Vietnamese people.

	The statement expressed: The Chinese people have made up their minds and are well-prepared to take all actions deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam at any time and place, jointly striking the U.S. aggressors until the Vietnamese people achieve final victory.

	All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese

	Xinhua News Agency, July 24th — The All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese issued a statement today saying that all returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and students of returned overseas Chinese, together with the people of the entire country, have made up their minds and are well-prepared to take all actions deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam at any time and place, jointly striking the U.S. aggressors.

	The statement expressed its most resolute support for Comrade Liu Shaoqi's declaration and most resolute support for Comrade Ho Chi Minh's "Message to the Nation."

	The statement pointed out that the U.S. imperialists recently, in their war "escalation" actions of aggression against Vietnam, attempted to use the barbaric means of "bombing for the sake of negotiations" to intimidate the heroic Vietnamese people, but due to the powerful response of Chairman Hu's battle call, it failed. The shameful face of the Soviet modern revisionist leadership playing the role of the number one accomplice of the U.S. imperialists was once again exposed to the people of the world.

	The statement said, the 700 million Chinese people swear to be the steadfast rear guard of their brotherly Vietnamese people, stand together with the Vietnamese people on the basis of proletarian internationalism, fight together, and achieve victory together, until the U.S. aggressors are thoroughly defeated.

    新华社二十四日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会无党派民主人士今天发表声明说，越南民主共和国胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》这个伟大的文告，是对美帝国主义“以炸迫和”阴谋的最有力的打击；是对充当美帝国主义“和谈”骗局头号帮凶的苏联修正主义领导集团以及印度总理、英国首相等合谋者的有力的当头棒喝。声明说，我们深信，有光荣反帝斗争传统的英雄越南人民，一定能够彻底打败美国侵略者，一定能够把美国强盗一个不剩地赶出越南。
    声明说，我国刘少奇主席七月二十二日代表七亿中国人民，向全世界发出了庄严的声明。我们一定遵照刘少奇主席的声明，坚决同全国人民一道，竭尽全力，支持和援助越南人民打到底，直到取得最后胜利。
    声明说，美帝国主义是一只貌似强大的纸老虎。美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防是它垂死挣扎的表现。声明说，不管美帝国主义采取疯狂的战争“升级”也好，或者是玩弄“和谈”阴谋也好，英雄的越南人民是吓不倒的，也是骗不了的。美帝国主义终究无法逃脱它必然失败的命运。
    声明说，越南人民反对美国侵略的正义斗争，不仅是为了捍卫越南人民的独立和自由，而且是对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反帝革命斗争的重大支持。正义是属于越南人民的，全世界革命人民都站在越南人民一边。

    声明说，中国民主促进会的全体会员，在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，决心同全国人民一道，同仇敌忾，万众一心，为援越抗美贡献自己的全部力量。
    农工民主党
    新华社二十四日讯　中国农工民主党今天发表声明说，中国农工民主党决心在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，同全中国人民一道，遵循中国政府七月三日和刘少奇主席七月二十二日发表的声明，响应我国政府的一切号召，最坚决地支持英雄的越南人民把抗美救国的正义斗争进行到底，取得最后胜利。
    中国农工民主党在声明中表示最坚决地支持越南民主共和国胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》。声明说，越南人民决心大，打得好。他们是屹立在全世界反帝斗争前哨的坚强战士。他们勇敢地保卫了祖国的独立，也有力地维护了世界的和平，为全世界人民的反帝斗争和革命事业作出了巨大的贡献。声明说，中国农工民主党对英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志，表示最崇高的敬意。
    中国农工民主党在声明中还揭露了美帝国主义“以炸迫和”的阴谋，并且严厉谴责苏联修正主义领导集团以及那些同美帝国主义合谋制造“和谈”骗局的牛鬼蛇神为美帝国主义效劳的罪行。
    致公党
    新华社二十四日讯　中国致公党中央委员会今天宣布，中国致公党的全体成员一定要更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，在伟大的毛泽东思想红旗指引下，坚决地同全国人民一道，站在越南人民这一边，全力支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，直到取得最后胜利。
    中国致公党中央委员会今天发表的声明说，刘少奇主席在代表中国七亿人民发表的声明中庄严重申：美帝国主义对越南的侵略，就是对中国的侵略，中国七亿人民，是越南人民的坚强后盾，中国辽阔的国土，是越南人民的可靠后方。中国致公党最坚决地拥护刘少奇主席的声明。
    声明在谈到越南民主共和国胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》等越南民主共和国最近发表的四个文告时指出，这四个文告表达了三千一百万越南人民的正义呼声，反映了越南人民抗战到底的坚强决心，中国致公党表示无限的钦佩和最坚决的支持。
    声明指出，事实充分证明，美帝国主义者比当年希特勒更残酷，更野蛮。声明还严厉谴责苏联修正主义领导集团在约翰逊政府“以炸迫和”的阴谋中公然充当美帝国主义头号帮凶的角色，妄图实现“苏美合作主宰世界”的野心。声明指出，这一事实更加暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团对越南人民抗美救国斗争假援助真出卖的叛徒嘴脸。

    声明严厉谴责美帝国主义为了摆脱在越南南方战场上覆灭的局面，竟悍然轰炸越南民主共和国的首都河内和第二大城市海防，妄图实现它的“以炸迫和”的罪恶阴谋。美帝的任何战争“升级”，绝对吓不倒越南人民，任何“和谈”阴谋，也欺骗不了越南人民，只能更加激发越南人民抗美救国的斗志。毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美帝国主义侵略越南也决不会违背这个逻辑的。
    声明还严厉谴责了苏联修正主义领导集团担当了美帝国主义“以炸迫和”罪恶活动的头号帮凶。声明说，胡志明主席《告全国同胞书》的庄严号召，揭穿了美帝的“和谈”骗局，也是对那些同美帝合谋制造“和谈”骗局的帮凶的当头一棒。苏联修正主义领导集团的一切阴谋活动，绝对挽救不了美帝侵略战争注定要彻底失败的命运，只不过更加暴露它出卖越南人民的叛徒面目。
    声明表示：中国人民下定了决心，做好了各种准备，随时随地采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动，共同打击美国侵略者，直到越南人民取得最后胜利。

    声明指出，美帝国主义最近在侵略越南的战争“升级”行动中，妄想用“以炸迫和”的野蛮手段来吓唬英雄的越南人民，由于遭到胡主席战斗号召的有力回答而破产。苏联现代修正主义领导集团充当美帝国主义头号帮凶的可耻面目，又一次暴露在全世界人民面前。
    声明说，中国七亿人民誓作兄弟的越南人民的坚强后盾，在无产阶级国际主义的基础上，同越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，直到彻底打败美国侵略者为止。
