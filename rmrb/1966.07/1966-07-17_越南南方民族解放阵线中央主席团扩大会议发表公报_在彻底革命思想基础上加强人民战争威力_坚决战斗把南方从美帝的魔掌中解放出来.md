The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam held an enlarged meeting from July 7 to 9. The statement issued by the meeting pointed out that the heroic people and liberation army of South Vietnam have the strength to defeat and will definitely defeat the American imperialists' limited war, just as they have already defeated their "special war." The meeting called on all military and civilian personnel to unite as one, firmly grasp their weapons, and resolutely fight to defeat the American imperialists' war of aggression in any situation.

The meeting was presided over by Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho. The meeting heard reports by Nguyen Huu Tho on the situation and tasks; by Nguyen Thi Dinh, Deputy Commander of the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces, on armed struggle and the building of the liberation armed forces; and by other leaders of the National Liberation Front on various aspects of work. The meeting analyzed the situation since the American imperialists began large-scale direct aggression against South Vietnam and proposed major tasks for the current struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

The statement said that the meeting unanimously agreed that, facing the failure of its "special war" strategy, the American imperialists, since the middle of 1965, have intensified the large-scale dispatch of American troops and mercenaries into South Vietnam, gradually transforming the "special war" into a limited war, while strengthening the war of destruction against North Vietnam with their air force. What is particularly serious is that they have recently, on the one hand, brazenly bombed the capital Hanoi and Haiphong, and on the other hand, played the "peace" trick to cover up their intensified aggression.

The statement said that the American aggressors are trying to save the crisis of the puppet army and, in the dry season, launch a strategic counteroffensive plan to regain the initiative on the battlefield that they have already lost. The American aggressors are also trying to stabilize the puppet regime, consolidate the cities and some rural areas that they can still control, "pacify" the rural areas that have already been liberated, gather the people to build "strategic hamlets," and attack and destroy the liberated mountain bases and rural areas.

The statement said that to achieve the above purposes, the American imperialists and their lackeys have used extremely brutal means of war: throwing most of the American and puppet troops into the battlefield, with the American troops acting as the vanguard and playing important roles, continuously launching long-term and large-scale "sweeping" operations, using the advantages of their air force and firepower, employing all the most modern weapons and technologies that the United States can use, using poison gas, chemical poisons, napalm, and other weapons on a large scale, and massacring large numbers of ordinary civilians and destroying villages.

The statement emphasized that, however, the American imperialists and their lackeys have not achieved their goals. The failures suffered by the American-puppet clique in the military, political, and economic fields are becoming increasingly heavy. In the limited war, especially in the dry season when they have been fighting against a very stubborn and brutal enemy, the people and liberation army of the South have achieved extremely great victories.

The statement said that in the military field, the people and military of the South have achieved extremely great victories in the five months of the dry season: they have annihilated a part of the important combat forces of the American-puppet troops, killed nearly 43,000 American troops, annihilated and disintegrated more than 70,000 puppet troops, destroyed and shot down 1,440 enemy aircraft, and destroyed 1,310 military vehicles. The liberation army has been able to annihilate entire battalions of American-puppet troops, and sometimes even entire regiments of American infantry and entire regiments of puppet troops. Guerrilla warfare continues to flourish and spread widely. The various liberation armed forces have not only not been annihilated but have been tempered and become stronger, and are developing rapidly. The American aggressors and their lackeys' plan to "regain the initiative" in the dry season has completely failed. The puppet army is increasingly collapsing, and the puppet regime is increasingly corrupt.

The statement said that the people of the South, with an iron will, have united as one and have foiled the enemy's attempt to control the cities and "pacify" the rural areas. The people of the South have not only defended but have further consolidated and expanded the revolutionary base areas. The enemy's narrow rear has become even smaller and more chaotic. The struggle of the people in various cities against the American imperialists and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique has developed on a large scale and has taken the form of fierce mass violence.

The statement said that, in summary, through the test of battle, especially the test of the dry season, the people and liberation army of the South have initially defeated the American imperialists' strategy of limited war. The liberation armed forces have maintained and developed the initiative on the battlefield, and the strategic situation of the South's revolution in the political and military fields is more consolidated than ever before. The entire situation in the South is changing and will change to be more favorable to the people of the South.

The statement said that from the fierce battles against the extremely brutal aggression of American imperialism, especially through the practice of this dry season, the meeting drew the following conclusions:

First, the political line and military line, strategic guidance, and tactical guidance that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has implemented in the past period are completely correct, and this is the most important factor ensuring the final victory of the South's liberation revolution.

Second, the heroic people and liberation army of South Vietnam can and will definitely defeat the limited war waged by American imperialism, just as they have defeated its "special war." No matter how many troops the American imperialists increase, they can only expand the scale of the war and suffer even greater defeats. The failure of the American policy of aggression and the complete collapse of the puppet army and puppet regime in South Vietnam are inevitable.

Third, the power of the people's war is invincible. The people and liberation army of South Vietnam, with a great determination based on thorough revolutionary ideology, with a high hatred of the aggressors and a spirit of sacrificing everything rather than being slaves, can highly develop the superiority of the people's war and their own advantages and deepen the enemy's weaknesses and shortcomings, overcome the difficulties encountered in the revolutionary process, and give the enemy one unexpected blow after another, thereby achieving greater and greater victories until they achieve complete victory.

The statement said that the meeting spent a considerable amount of time analyzing the possible tricks the enemy might play in the future and the possible developments of the situation, and decided on the tasks and various work proposals for the future. The meeting believes that although the American imperialists have suffered heavy defeats in the "special war" and initial defeats in the limited war, they are still very stubborn and unwilling to give up their ambitions of aggression, continuing to strengthen and expand the war, continuing to send more American troops and their lackeys to South Vietnam, and escalating the war of destruction against the North, while continuing to play the "peace talks" trick. However, no matter how stubborn they are, no matter what brutal, cunning tricks and means they use, they will inevitably suffer heavy defeats. The military and civilian personnel of the South and the National Liberation Front have enough strength to smash all the tricks and means of the American bandits and their lackeys and achieve final victory.

The meeting pointed out that the firm and unshakable goal of the struggle of the people and the National Liberation Front of the South is: to resolutely fight to liberate the South from the yoke of American imperialism and its lackeys. The meeting expressed that as long as the American imperialists do not stop the war of aggression against Vietnam and do not withdraw the troops and weapons of the United States and its lackeys, the united military and civilian personnel of the South will firmly grasp their weapons and resolutely fight to defeat the war of aggression waged by American imperialism and strive for final victory.

The meeting pointed out that the current task of the National Liberation Front is: to develop the great victories that have already been achieved, to further strengthen unity, to mobilize the entire army and people to be determined to defeat the war of aggression of American imperialism in any situation, to vigorously promote armed struggle, political struggle, and the work of disintegrating the enemy's army, to annihilate more of the enemy's combat forces, to defend and expand the liberated areas, to strengthen external work, to vigorously seek international sympathy and support, and to lead the cause of resisting American aggression and saving the nation of the people of South Vietnam to complete victory.

The statement said that the meeting, on the basis of pointing out the overall tasks, also proposed a series of major proposals and specific measures to further strengthen unity, consolidate and expand the united front of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation; to strengthen armed struggle and build a powerful armed force, to widely carry out people's guerrilla warfare in various places, to annihilate more of the combat forces of the American-puppet clique; to strengthen political struggle in cities and rural areas, to foil the enemy's vicious political tricks, to strengthen propaganda work among the puppet army, American army, and mercenary soldiers; to shrink the enemy's rear, to consolidate and expand the base areas and the rural areas that have already been liberated, to smash the enemy's "pacification" plan; to increase production, practice strict economy, care for and protect the people's lives and property, gradually improve material and cultural life, develop cultural education and health undertakings, and mobilize manpower, material resources, and financial resources to serve the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

    越南南方民族解放阵线中央主席团扩大会议发表公报
　　在彻底革命思想基础上加强人民战争威力  坚决战斗把南方从美帝的魔掌中解放出来
    新华社河内十六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团从七月七日到九日举行了扩大会议。会议发表的公报指出，英雄的越南南方人民和解放军完全有力量打败并且一定能打败美帝国主义的局部战争，正象过去已经打败了它的“特种战争”一样。会议号召全体军民团结一致，紧握手中枪，坚决战斗，在任何情况下都要打败美帝国主义的侵略战争。
    这次会议是在阮友寿主席主持下举行的。会议听取了阮友寿作的关于形势和任务的报告；越南南方解放武装力量副司令员阮氏定作的关于武装斗争和建设解放武装力量的报告；南方民族解放阵线其他领导人作的各方面的工作报告。会议分析了自从美帝国主义大规模派遣军队直接侵略越南南方以来的形势，提出了当前抗美救国斗争的重大任务。
    公报说，会议一致认为，美帝国主义在面临“特种战争”战略破产的情况下，为了挽救败局，自一九六五年年中以来加紧大规模派遣美军和雇佣军进入越南南方，把“特种战争”逐步转变为局部战争，同时加强以空军对越南北方进行破坏性战争。尤其严重的是，它最近一方面悍然轰炸首都河内和海防，另一方面又玩弄“和平”骗局，以掩饰它加强侵略战争的行动。
    公报说，美国侵略者企图挽救伪军的危机，并且在旱季展开一个战略反攻计划，夺回在战场上已经失去的主动权。美国侵略者还企图稳定伪政权，巩固它还能控制的各个城市和一些农村地区，“绥靖”已解放了的农村地区，把人民集中起来建立“战略村”，进攻和破坏已解放了的山区根据地和农村地区的经济。
    公报说，为了实现上述目的，美帝国主义及其走狗使用了极其残暴的战争手段：把大部分美、伪军投到战场上，以美军担任突击队和重要角色，连续地展开长期和大规模的“扫荡”，利用空军和火力的优势，动用了美国所能用的所有最现代化的武器和技术，大规模地使用毒气、化学毒剂、凝固汽油弹等等，大批屠杀普通居民和摧毁村庄。
    公报强调指出，但是，美帝国主义及其走狗的这些目的都没有达到。美伪集团在军事、政治和经济等方面所遭到的失败越来越沉重。在局部战争中，特别是在旱季同一个极其顽固和残暴的敌人较量后，南方人民和解放军已经取得了非常巨大的胜利。
    公报说，在军事方面，南方军民在旱季五个月中已经取得了非常巨大的胜利：消灭美伪军的一部分重要有生力量，歼灭近四万三千名美军，歼灭和瓦解七万多伪军，击毁击落敌机一千四百四十架，击毁军车一千三百一十辆。解放军已经能够一举歼灭美伪军整个营，有时甚至歼灭美国步兵的整个战团和伪军的整个团。游击战争继续蓬勃和广泛地发展。各解放武装力量不仅没有被消灭，而是锻炼得更加坚强，并且快速地发展。美国侵略军及其走狗要在旱季中“夺回主动权”的计划已经完全破产。伪军日益崩溃，伪政权日益腐败。
    公报说，南方人民本着钢铁般的决心，团结一致，已经挫败了敌人妄图控制城市和“绥靖”农村的阴谋。南方人民不仅保卫了，而且进一步巩固和扩大了革命根据地。敌人的狭小的后方更加缩小，更加陷于严重混乱。各城市人民展开的反对美帝国主义及其阮文绍—阮高其走狗集团的斗争，已经得到大规模的发展，并且采取了群众暴力斗争的激烈形式。
    公报说，总而言之，通过战斗考验，尤其是旱季的考验，南方人民和解放军已经初步击败了美帝国主义的局部战争战略。解放武装力量保持并发展了在战场上的主动权，南方革命在政治和军事方面的战略形势比过去更加巩固了。整个南方局面已经和正在转变为对南方人民更加有利。
    公报说，从进行抗击美帝国主义极其残暴的侵略战争的激烈战斗中，尤其是通过这次旱季的考验的实践，会议得出了下列几点结论：
    一、越南南方民族解放阵线在过去期间所实行的政治路线和军事路线，战略指导和战术指导，都是完全正确的，这是保证南方解放革命取得最后胜利的最重要的因素。
    二、英雄的越南南方人民和解放军完全能够打败并且必将打败美帝国主义所进行的局部战争，正如过去打败它所进行的特种战争一样。不管美帝国主义增加多少军队，也只能扩大战争的规模使其遭到更大的失败而已。美国的侵略政策的破产，南越伪军、伪政权的完全崩溃是注定了的。
    三、人民战争的威力是无敌的。越南南方人民和解放军抱着建立在彻底革命思想基础上的巨大决心，本着高度仇恨侵略者、宁可牺牲一切而决不甘当奴隶的精神，因此能够高度发挥人民战争的优越性和自己的优势并加深敌人的劣势和弱点，克服在革命进程中所碰到的艰难，给予敌人一个又一个出其不意的打击，进而争取日益巨大的胜利，直至获得完全的胜利。
    公报说，会议以相当长的时间对敌人今后可能施展的阴谋、对形势发展的可能性进行了分析，并决定了今后的任务和各项工作主张。会议认为，美帝国主义虽然在特种战争中遭到惨重失败和在局部战争中遭到初步失败，但仍然十分顽固，仍然不肯放弃侵略野心，仍然继续加强和扩大战争，继续向南越增派美军及其仆从军，把对北方进行的破坏性战争“升级”，另一方面仍在继续玩弄“和谈”骗局。然而，不管它多么顽固，不管它采取什么残暴、奸诈的阴谋和手段，它必定会遭到惨重的失败。南方军民和南方民族解放阵线完全有足够的力量粉碎美国强盗及其走狗的一切阴谋和手段，夺取最后胜利。
    会议指出，南方人民和民族解放阵线坚定不移的斗争目标是：坚决战斗，把南方从美帝国主义及其走狗的统治枷锁中解放出来。会议表示，只要美帝国主义不停止侵越战争、不撤出美国及其仆从国的军队和武器，团结一致的南方军民要紧握枪杆，坚决战斗，一定要打败美帝国主义所进行的侵略战争，争取最后胜利。
    会议指出民族解放阵线的当前任务是：发展已经获得的巨大胜利，进一步加强团结，动员全军全民决心在任何情况下击败美帝国主义的侵略战争，大力促进武装斗争、政治斗争和瓦解敌军工作，消灭更多的敌人有生力量，保卫和扩大解放区，加强对外工作，大力争取国际的同情和支援，将越南南方人民的抗美救国事业引向完全胜利。
    公报说，会议在指出总的任务的基础上，还提出了一系列重大主张和具体措施，以便进一步加强团结，巩固和扩大抗美救国统一战线；加强武装斗争和建设强大的武装力量，在各地广泛开展人民游击战争，消灭美伪集团的更多有生力量；加强城市和农村的政治斗争，挫败敌人的恶毒政治阴谋，加强对伪军、美军和帮凶军士兵的宣传工作；缩小敌人的后方，巩固和扩大根据地和已解放了的农村，粉碎敌人的“绥靖”计划；增加生产，厉行节约，关心和保护人民的生命财产，逐步改善物质和文化生活，发展文化教育和卫生事业，动员人力、物力和财力来为抗美救国斗争服务。
