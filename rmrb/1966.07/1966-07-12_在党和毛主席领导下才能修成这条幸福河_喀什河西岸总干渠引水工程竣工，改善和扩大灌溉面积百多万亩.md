The largest water conservancy project in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Region of Xinjiang—the Kashgar River West Bank Main Canal Irrigation Project—has recently been completed and water has been released. The completion of this project will improve the irrigation of over 900,000 mu of land and expand the irrigation area by 160,000 mu, playing a crucial role in promoting the construction of stable, high-yield farmland and further developing agricultural production in the Ili Region.

On the day of the water release ceremony, over ten thousand farmers and herdsmen of various ethnic groups, holding high red flags and portraits of Chairman Mao and Chairman Liu, enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" Many elderly poor peasants excitedly said, "Only under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao could we build this river of happiness!"

The completion of this project is a new victory for the people of Ili, who have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized politics, and implemented the Party's policy of relying on 500 million peasants to build water conservancy projects.

The Kashgar River is one of the three main tributaries of the Ili River. The soil in the irrigation area is fertile, making it an ideal place for agricultural development. However, due to the incomplete original canal system and the lack of fixed water diversion facilities, a large amount of manpower and resources had to be spent each year to build dams and block water in the river, making irrigation uncertain and significantly impacting agricultural production. To fundamentally change this situation, in October 1965, the Party organizations at various levels in the Ili Region led the masses to start building the Kashgar River West Bank Main Canal Irrigation Project. The task was enormous. However, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of various ethnic groups displayed revolutionary spirit and completed the task quickly, efficiently, and economically. The amount of earth and stonework completed exceeded the original plan; the construction period was shorter than planned, achieving the goal of starting and benefiting from the project in the same year; the quality of the main project was good, and several canal extension projects were completed beyond the plan, expanding the beneficiary area; both investment and labor input were significantly reduced compared to the original plan.

During the construction period, the construction site was like a large school. The majority of the workers (local commune members) and cadres extensively studied Chairman Mao's essays such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." The construction site command also invited many poor and lower-middle peasants who had suffered in the Kashgar River during the old society to share the "river history" with the workers and cadres, exposing the crimes of the landlords and rich farmers who monopolized the river water and exploited the poor peasants. The workers further enhanced their class consciousness and understood that "river management is revolution." The construction site was filled with a revolutionary spirit. The West Bank Main Canal was re-excavated on the old riverbed of gravel in the Gobi Desert. Near the canal head, there is a 300-meter section that required cutting through a 28-meter-high hill, making the task arduous and the construction difficult. However, the workers were not deterred by the challenges. They repeatedly studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and, with their indomitable revolutionary will, successfully built the canal.

The construction of the Kashgar River West Bank Main Canal has been closely followed and strongly supported by the Party and the state from beginning to end. The local People's Liberation Army also provided significant support in terms of technology, materials, and manpower.

　　在党和毛主席领导下才能修成这条幸福河
　　喀什河西岸总干渠引水工程竣工，改善和扩大灌溉面积百多万亩
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆伊犁哈萨克自治州最大的水利工程——喀什河西岸总干渠引水工程，已于最近竣工放水。这项工程的建成，可以改善灌溉面积九十多万亩，扩大灌溉面积十六万亩，对促进伊犁地区稳产高产农田的建设和农业生产的进一步发展，将起重要作用。
    放水的当天，参加放水典礼的一万多名各族农牧民，高举着红旗，高举着毛主席、刘主席的画象，纵情欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”许多老贫农激动地说：“只有在党和毛主席的领导下，我们才能修出这条幸福河呵！”
    这项工程的建成，是伊犁各族人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，贯彻执行党的依靠五亿农民办水利方针的新胜利。
    喀什河是伊犁河三大支流之一。灌区土壤肥沃，是发展农业生产的好地方。但是，由于原来渠系不够完善，没有固定的引水设施，每年都要花费大批人力、物力，在河里压坝堵水，灌溉得不到保证，农业生产的发展受到很大影响。为了彻底改变这种状况，一九六五年十月，伊犁地区各级党组织领导广大人民开始兴建喀什河西岸总干渠引水工程。工程任务相当艰巨。但是，在毛泽东思想的指引下，各族人民发扬革命精神，多快好省地完成了这一任务。完成的土石方超过原来的计划；工期比计划缩短，做到了当年施工当年受益；主干工程质量好，而且超计划做了几条渠道的扩大延伸工程，扩大了受益面积；投资和投工数都比原计划节约很多。
    施工时期，工地就象一所巨大的学校，广大民工（附近人民公社社员）和干部普遍学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》等文章。工地指挥部还聘请了不少旧社会在喀什河受过苦的贫下中农，给民工和干部大讲喀什河的“河史”，控诉旧社会地主、财主霸占河水，压榨贫苦农民的罪恶。广大民工进一步提高了阶级觉悟，认识到“治河就是革命”的道理。工地上到处充满了意气风发的革命精神。西岸总干渠是在戈壁卵石的旧河床上重新开挖的，靠近渠首有一段三百米长的地段，需要劈开一个二十八米高的山头，任务艰巨，施工困难。但是，民工们并没有被困难吓倒，他们反复学习了《愚公移山》，终于用顽强的革命意志修好了渠道。
    喀什河西岸总干渠的兴修，自始至终都受到党和国家的亲切关怀和大力支持，驻地人民解放军也从技术、物质、人力等方面给了很大的支援。
