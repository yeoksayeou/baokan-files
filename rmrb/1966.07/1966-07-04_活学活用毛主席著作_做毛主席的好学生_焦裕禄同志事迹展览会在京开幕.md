	Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Works Actively  Be a Good Student of Chairman Mao
	Exhibition of Comrade Jiao Yulu's Deeds Opens in Beijing

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 3rd, the exhibition of the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Chairman Mao, opened on the 2nd at the National Art Museum of China in the capital. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers warmly welcomed this exhibition held during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, praising it as a classroom of Mao Zedong Thought and a new battleground for attacking anti-party, anti-socialist elements.

	This exhibition, organized by the Chinese Revolutionary Museum, has a large plaster statue of our great leader, Chairman Mao, at the entrance. Upon entering the exhibition hall, under the golden statue of Chairman Mao, there is a statue of Comrade Jiao Yulu studying Chairman Mao's works with great concentration. Behind him are three lines of prominent large characters: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions." The exhibition features 218 items, including artworks, photographs, models, and documents from the Lan Khao County Committee, as well as Chairman Mao's works that Comrade Jiao Yulu studied during his lifetime, tools he used for labor and office work, and many handwritten materials. These items record Comrade Jiao Yulu's brilliant deeds of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, shining with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The exhibition is divided into four parts. The first part reflects how, after Chairman Mao issued the great call to "never forget class struggle" at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, Comrade Jiao Yulu, carrying the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and the spirit of the Eighth Plenum's resolutions, came to Lan Khao County with great confidence, where class struggle was sharp and complex and natural disasters were severe. The second part introduces from various angles how Comrade Jiao Yulu, following Chairman Mao's teachings, emphasized politics, took class struggle as the key link, and led the people of Lan Khao in their struggle against disasters. The third part, titled "Devoted to the Revolution with Loyalty, Dedicated to the People with Selflessness," introduces the indomitable will and communist spirit of Comrade Jiao Yulu, who was seriously ill. The final part is about how, after Comrade Jiao Yulu's death, the people of Lan Khao held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strove to realize the great revolutionary ideal of "The people of Lan Khao have great aspirations, daring to change the heavens and the earth." Each part of the exhibition uses many quotations from Chairman Mao, and visitors strongly feel that Comrade Jiao Yulu's growth and the rapid changes in Lan Khao are the results of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	The exhibits that show Comrade Jiao Yulu's emphasis on politics and his resolute struggle against class enemies deeply educate the audience on class struggle. Facing the sharp and complex class struggle at home and abroad at that time, Comrade Jiao Yulu, upon arriving in Lan Khao, proposed at the county committee: "Internationally, we must resist the anti-China chorus of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries; domestically, we must resist the capitalist black wind." He also clearly stated: "To do all work well, we must emphasize class education, class struggle, and implement the class line." He faithfully carried out Chairman Mao's instructions on class and class struggle, issuing a battle cry to the cadres and masses of the entire county: "In this struggle, we must confront it head-on and cannot avoid it. To carry out proletarian dictatorship, we cannot allow the ghosts and snakes to launch a rampage. We must launch a counterattack and sweep away the ghosts and snakes!" Many visitors, upon seeing these exhibits, could not help but link them to the current situation of the Cultural Revolution, expressing their determination to take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, to forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and strive to master and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to thoroughly expose, overthrow, and smash the anti-party, anti-socialist ghosts and snakes!

	Since the pre-exhibition began on June 20th, there have been large crowds of workers, peasants, and soldiers visiting the exhibition every day. Five cadres and community members from the Si Ji Qing People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing, including Li Mo Lin, the commune director, and Yang Qing Shan, the chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association, used their personal experiences of studying Chairman Mao's works to praise the great power of Mao Zedong Thought shown in the exhibits. After denouncing the counter-revolutionary crimes of the former Beijing Municipal Committee for opposing Mao Zedong Thought, Li Mo Lin excitedly expressed: "Chairman Mao's books are a great treasure trove. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants. The more the enemy hates it, the more we love it; the more the enemy opposes it, the more we must study it. We will love it for life, study it for life, and act according to Chairman Mao's words for life." Oil workers from Daqing Oilfield and soldiers from various places who came to visit the exhibition angrily denounced the criminal actions of the anti-party, anti-socialist elements for attacking Mao Zedong Thought, determining to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, just like Comrade Jiao Yulu, to forever be loyal to the Party, to the most beloved leader Chairman Mao, and to the great Mao Zedong Thought, to sweep away all ghosts and snakes, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    活学活用毛主席著作  做毛主席的好学生
    焦裕禄同志事迹展览会在京开幕
    据新华社三日讯　毛主席的好学生——焦裕禄同志事迹展览会，二日在首都中国美术馆开幕。广大工农兵群众热烈欢迎在无产阶级文化大革命中举办的这个展览会，赞扬它是毛泽东思想的课堂，是向反党反社会主义的黑帮分子开火的新阵地。
    由中国革命博物馆举办的这个展览会，入口处矗立着我国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席的大型石膏塑象。走进展览大厅，在毛主席的金色头象下，是焦裕禄同志聚精会神地学习毛主席著作的塑象，他的背后衬托着三行醒目的大字：读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。展览会上陈列的二百一十八件展品中，除美术作品、照片、模型和兰考县委的文件外，还有焦裕禄同志生前学习过的毛主席著作、使用过的劳动和办公用具及亲笔书写的许多文字材料。这些展品，记载着焦裕禄同志活学活用毛主席著作的光辉事迹，闪烁着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。
    展览共分四个部分。第一部分反映的，是毛主席在党的八届十中全会上发出“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召以后，焦裕禄同志带着《毛泽东选集》和八届十中全会决议的精神，满怀信心地来到了阶级斗争尖锐复杂和自然灾害十分严重的兰考县。第二部分，从多方面介绍了焦裕禄同志遵循毛主席的教导，突出政治，以阶级斗争为纲，领导兰考人民进行抗灾斗争的英雄事迹。在题为“对革命赤胆忠心，为人民鞠躬尽瘁”的第三部分，介绍了身患重病的焦裕禄同志毫不利己、专门利人的顽强毅力和共产主义精神。最后一部分是兰考人民在焦裕禄同志逝世以后，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，努力实现“兰考人民多奇志，敢教日月换新天”的远大革命理想。展览会各部分都选用了许多毛主席语录，人们参观时，强烈感受到焦裕禄同志的成长和兰考面貌的迅速改变，是活学活用毛主席著作的结果，是威力无穷的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    表现焦裕禄同志处处突出政治、狠抓阶级斗争的展品，使观众们受到了深刻的阶级教育。面对着当时国内外尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，焦裕禄同志一到兰考，就在县委提出：在国际上要顶住帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反华大合唱，在国内要顶住资本主义黑风的进攻。他还明确提出：“抓阶级教育、阶级斗争和贯彻阶级路线，这是做好各项工作的根本所在。”他忠实地执行了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的指示，向全县干部群众发出战斗号召：“对这场斗争应针锋相对，不能回避斗争。要进行无产阶级专政，就不能让牛鬼蛇神猖狂进攻。我们要进行反击，扫荡牛鬼蛇神！”许多观众在看这些展品的时候，都不禁和当前文化大革命的形势联系起来，纷纷表示：一定要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，努力掌握和运用毛泽东思想，把反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神彻底地揭露出来，斗倒，斗臭，斗垮！
    这个展览会从六月二十日开始预展以来，每天都有大批工农兵群众前往参观。北京郊区四季青人民公社社长李墨林、生产队贫协主席杨青山等五个干部、社员，用自己学习毛主席著作的亲身感受，欢呼展品显示的毛泽东思想的巨大威力。李墨林在控诉了前北京市委反对毛泽东思想的反革命罪行以后，激动地表示：毛主席的书是个大宝库。毛泽东思想是我们贫下中农的命根子，敌人越恨，我们越爱，敌人越反对，我们越是要学，我们要爱一辈子，学一辈子，照着毛主席的话干一辈子。来自大庆油田的石油工人和来自各地的人民解放军指战员，在参观以后，愤怒斥责反党反社会主义的黑帮分子攻击毛泽东思想的罪恶言行，决心象焦裕禄同志那样活学活用毛主席著作，永远忠于党，永远忠于最敬爱的领袖毛主席，永远忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
