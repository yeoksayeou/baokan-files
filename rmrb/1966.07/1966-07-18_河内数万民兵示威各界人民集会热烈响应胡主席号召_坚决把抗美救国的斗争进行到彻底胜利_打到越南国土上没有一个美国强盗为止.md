The U.S. imperialists and reactionaries of various countries are all paper tigers. The Chinese people's struggle has proven this. The Vietnamese people's struggle is proving this.

Tens of thousands of militiamen and people from all walks of life in Hanoi respond warmly to Chairman Hu's call to decisively carry out the struggle against the U.S. and save the nation to complete victory, drive out all U.S. aggressors from Vietnamese soil

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, Hanoi, July 17 – Our correspondent reports: On July 17, tens of thousands of militiamen and youth participating in the "Three Preparations" movement in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, carrying the banner "Determined to Defeat the U.S. Aggressors," fully armed, marched in a grand anti-U.S. armed demonstration. They inspected their own strength, strengthened their combat mobilization, and resolutely responded to and enthusiastically supported Chairman Hu's great battle call.

	At the demonstration and inspection meeting, they unanimously passed a letter of determination to Chairman Hu and the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, expressing their determination to implement Chairman Hu's call and turn every street and every house in Hanoi into a strong battle fortress. Whether the U.S. aggressors come from the sky or from the ground, they will make them come to no avail and drown them in the vast sea of the Vietnamese people's war.

	They also expressed their determination to consciously act, enthusiastically respond to Chairman Hu's mobilization order, be prepared, and stand by at any time to join the front lines and annihilate the U.S. aggressors.

	After the demonstration and inspection meeting, tens of thousands of militiamen and youth marched in armed demonstrations in several columns. They held high portraits of Chairman Hu, Chairman Hu's "Letter to All Compatriots," and large banners, marching forward along various roads to the tune of the military band playing the battle song "Liberate the South." The masses standing on both sides of the road also raised their arms and shouted with the demonstrators: "Firmly implement Chairman Hu's teachings, determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors!" "The entire army and people of the nation unite, fear no hardships or sacrifices, fight to the end!" "Vietnam will win, the U.S. will lose!" "Long live Chairman Hu!" The powerful slogans showed the indomitable and invincible power of the heroic Vietnamese people.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, Hanoi, July 17 – Our correspondent reports: On July 17, people from all walks of life in the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, held meetings to enthusiastically respond to Chairman Hu's battle call. The entire city's military and people solemnly vowed: to firmly implement Chairman Hu's call, fear no hardships, spare no sacrifices, and be determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors, carrying out the great struggle to resist the U.S. and save the nation to complete victory.

	Early in the morning of July 17, when the Hanoi radio station began broadcasting the recorded speech of Chairman Hu's "Letter to All Compatriots," the entire city was in an uproar. People from all walks of life flocked to the streets and places with loudspeakers, excitedly listening to the battle call of their beloved leader. Immediately, various departments, troops, factories, schools, shops, and suburban agricultural cooperatives held meetings, expressing their determination to firmly respond to Chairman Hu's battle call. The masses raised their arms and shouted slogans: "Firmly implement Chairman Hu's teachings, fear no hardships, fear no sacrifices, determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors!" "Firmly drive the U.S. aggressors out of South Vietnam!" "Vietnam will win, the U.S. will lose!"

	At the meeting of the Hanoi Capital Garrison Command, Political Department Director Vuong Cong Ban, on behalf of all officers and soldiers, said that Chairman Hu's great call embodies the iron will and determination of the 31 million Vietnamese people to completely defeat the U.S. aggressors. We guarantee to Chairman Hu: we will fear no hardships, spare no sacrifices, and firmly complete the glorious task of defending the motherland. The meeting passed a letter of determination and a telegram to the liberated armed forces and people in the West Saigon and Hue regions of South Vietnam. They expressed in the telegram that they would take the unyielding spirit of the West Saigon and Hue military and people as an example, fight tenaciously, and give the invading U.S. aggressors a heavy blow.

	More than a thousand representatives of men and women from all walks of life in Hanoi also held a grand meeting. Vu Huu Duan, Secretary of the Hanoi City Committee of the Vietnam Labor Youth League, said at the meeting that Chairman Hu's call embodies the will, wishes, and strength of the Vietnamese people and youth. The Vietnamese nation is a heroic nation, preferring to die standing rather than live kneeling; preferring to sacrifice everything rather than endure humiliation and become slaves of the U.S. aggressors. He said that in dealing with the U.S. aggressors, the Vietnamese people can only have one answer, that is: fight, fight fiercely, fight resolutely, if this generation cannot finish fighting, the next generation will continue, until there is not a single U.S. aggressor on their beloved soil.

	The meeting, on behalf of more than 200,000 young people in Hanoi, passed a letter of determination to Chairman Hu and the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party. They solemnly vowed to the motherland in the letter of determination: they have already made preparations and are ready to respond to the motherland's call at any time. No matter what the situation, no matter how fierce the war, the youth of the capital of Vietnam will always stand firmly and forever be the iron vanguard fighters.

	Today, at the mass meetings in Hanoi, the heroic Vietnamese military and people sang the national anthem of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the song "Liberate the South" with great passion. The powerful songs and battle slogans echoed through the sky of the heroic capital. (With pictures)
