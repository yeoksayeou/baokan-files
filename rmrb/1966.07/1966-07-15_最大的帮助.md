	The Greatest Help
	Soldier Duān Tiān'ān

	I arrived at the unit and was assigned to the same platoon as Comrade Liu Yingjun. On the second day, he came to talk to me and took out a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," enthusiastically saying, "Let's study together, okay?" I said, "I can't read." He said, "Not being able to read is no problem. I'll read to you, and later I'll slowly teach you to read." With that, he pulled me to sit beside him and read an essay, "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." He said, "Not being able to read is a difficulty, but as long as we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man, we can overcome any difficulty."

	After that, we often studied Chairman Mao's works together. He specially gave me two notebooks, on which he wrote "Serve the People" and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" in large characters, encouraging me to study hard. My hands, which were used to holding a hoe, felt like they were holding a thousand-pound weight when I picked up a pen, and I couldn't write a single character properly, sweating all over. He then held my hand and taught me stroke by stroke.

	One day, I saw others writing their thoughts on studying Chairman Mao's works, and I also wanted to write, but I could barely write a few large characters. Not having any education is truly difficult! At this time, Comrade Liu Yingjun came to study with me again, this time "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." He seriously said to me, "Your thinking is wrong! If you don't study Chairman Mao's works, you will go downhill, lose your way, and there is a danger of changing color!" He also said, "The revolution is everyone's business, with your share and mine. If one person does not study Chairman Mao's works, it reduces one part of the revolutionary force, and this is no longer just one person's matter!" His words deeply educated and moved me. From then on, I began to study hard. He was truly happy from the bottom of his heart to see me actively studying Chairman Mao's works.

	He not only enthusiastically helped me but also enthusiastically helped other comrades. He truly regarded helping others study Chairman Mao's works as his greatest revolutionary responsibility. (Attached photo)

	Comrade Liu Yingjun has an infinite love for Mao Zedong Thought. During marches, he carried the quotation board of Chairman Mao on his back, studying and propagating wherever he went. This quotation board was personally made by Comrade Liu Yingjun, and the characters "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on it are in his own handwriting.

　　最大的帮助
　　战士　段天安
    我刚到部队就和刘英俊同志在一个班。下班第二天，他就找我谈心，并且拿出一本《毛泽东著作选读》，热情地跟我说：“咱俩一起学习好吗？”我说：“我不识字呀。”他说：“不识字没关系，我念你听，以后再慢慢教你识字。”说着，就拉我并肩坐下，念了一篇《愚公移山》。他说：“不识字是个困难，但只要咱们能按毛主席教导办，有愚公移山的精神，天大的困难也能战胜。”
    打那以后，我们经常在一起学习毛主席著作。他还特意送给我两本笔记本，上面写着“为人民服务”“将革命进行到底”十二个大字，勉励我好好学习。我这使惯了锄头的手，拿起笔来象有千斤重，弄得满头大汗也写不好一个字，他就把着我的手，一笔一画地教。
    有一天，我看人家写学习毛主席著作的心得，我也想写，可是斗大的字也写不出几个，没有文化真困难！这时，刘英俊同志又找我一起学习《愚公移山》。他严肃地对我说：“你的想法不对呀！不学习毛主席著作就要走下坡路，就要迷失方向，就有变颜色的危险！”他还说：“革命是大家的事，有你一份，也有我一份。一个人不学习毛主席著作，就少一份革命的力量，这就不是一个人的事啦！”他的话使我深受教育和感动。从此，我就努力学习起来。他对我积极学习毛主席著作，真是打心眼里高兴。
    他不仅这样热心地帮助我，也热心地帮助其他同志。他真是把帮助别人学习毛主席著作，当作是自己最大的革命责任。（附图片）
    刘英俊同志无限热爱毛泽东思想，行军时，他把毛主席语录板背在身上，走到那里，学到那里、宣传到那里。这块语录板，是刘英俊同志亲自制作的，语录板上的“毛主席语录”五个字是他的手迹。
