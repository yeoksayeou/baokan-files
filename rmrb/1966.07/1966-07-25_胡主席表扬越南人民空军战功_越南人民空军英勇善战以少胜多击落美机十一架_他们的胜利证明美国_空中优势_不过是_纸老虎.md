Chairman Hu praises the combat achievements of the Vietnam People's Air Force. The Vietnam People's Air Force, brave and skilled, has achieved a great victory by striking down 11 American planes with fewer forces. Their victory proves that the American "air superiority" is nothing but a "paper tiger."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 22nd: On July 20th, Chairman Ho Chi Minh wrote a letter to all officers and soldiers of the Vietnam People's Air Force, expressing his warm praise on behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for their brilliant victories in recent battles against American aggressor planes.

Chairman Hu said in the letter that in recent battles, the pilot comrades fought bravely and wisely, achieving many feats and shooting down multiple American aggressor planes. The officers and staff of the Vietnamese Air Force have a high sense of responsibility and the spirit of doing everything to defeat the enemy.

Chairman Hu called on the officers and soldiers of the Vietnam People's Air Force to always be vigilant and maintain their fighting spirit; to continuously strive to improve their tactics, technology, ideological, and political levels; to have the spirit of collective merit; and to cooperate well with the people and other units of the people's armed forces to achieve more and greater victories, making due contributions to defeating the American aggressors.

The General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army wrote a letter on July 21st to the people and armed forces of North Vietnam, commending their major victories of shooting down 22 American aggressor planes and capturing a batch of American air pirates on July 19th and 20th.

The letter warmly praised the people of Hanoi, Haiphong, North Thai, Ninh Binh, Ha Tay, Phu Tho, Bac Ninh, Quang Ninh, Vinh Phuc, Lang Son, and Nghe An for their wholehearted assistance to the troops, together with the people's armed forces, defeating the American aggressors.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 22nd: Our reporter reports: The young Vietnam People's Air Force bravely defends the country's airspace, fighting fiercely against American air pirates. According to statistics, since June 29th, when American aggressor planes brazenly bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, to July 21st, this heroic Vietnam People's Air Force has shot down 11 American aggressor planes, achieving great victories.

The American imperialists have repeatedly boasted about their "air superiority," looking down on the young Vietnam People's Air Force. However, the brave and victorious airmen of Vietnam see the American "air superiority" as a "paper tiger." They told reporters: "What decides the outcome of the war is people, not weapons. The American Air Force is nothing special; we can definitely defeat it!" On June 29th, when dozens of batches of American aggressor planes crazily attacked Hanoi, the heroic Vietnam People's Air Force faced the ferocious enemy, achieving victory with fewer forces, immediately shooting down two modern American jet fighters. Then, they almost flew every day to meet the challenge, fighting stronger every day, winning every battle. On July 13th and 14th, they consecutively shot down four American planes in the skies of Ha Tay and Hung Yen provinces.

On July 17th, Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great battle call further inspired these brave and tenacious air force soldiers, who expressed their determination with outstanding battle actions. In the air battles on July 19th and 21st, they immediately struck down three American aggressor planes with fierce artillery fire.

Now, this heroic people's air force, which has been warmly praised by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, is even more spirited and full of fighting spirit. In their letter of determination to Chairman Hu, they promised: "We will definitely implement Chairman Hu's teachings, carry forward the victories we have achieved, fight more bravely and tenaciously, defend the country's airspace, and give a heavier blow to all American air pirates who dare to invade, thoroughly smashing their 'air superiority'!"

    胡主席表扬越南人民空军战功
    越南人民空军英勇善战以少胜多击落美机十一架
    他们的胜利证明美国“空中优势”不过是“纸老虎”
    据新华社河内二十二日电　胡志明主席二十日写信给越南人民空军全体干部和战士，代表越南劳动党中央和越南民主共和国政府热烈表扬他们最近在同美国强盗飞机的战斗中取得的辉煌胜利。
    胡主席在信中说，在最近的战斗中，飞行员同志们英勇和机智地战斗，立了许多战功，击落美国强盗飞机多架。越南空军的干部和工作人员都有着高度的责任感和一切为了战胜敌人的精神。
    胡主席号召越南人民空军干部和战士必须时刻提高警惕和战斗意志；必须不断努力，提高战术、技术、思想和政治水平；要有集体立功精神；必须同人民和人民武装力量的其他单位很好配合，争取更多更大的成绩，为战胜美国侵略强盗作出应有的贡献。
    越南人民军总司令部二十一日写信给越南北方人民、武装力量各部队，表彰他们在十九日和二十日两天击落美国强盗飞机二十二架、活捉一批美国飞贼的重大胜利。
    信中热烈表扬河内、海防、北太、永福、河西、富寿、和平、广宁、宣光、谅山和义安等地人民，全心全力地协助部队，同人民武装力量一起战胜美国侵略强盗。
    新华社河内二十二日电　本社记者报道：年轻的越南人民空军，英勇地捍卫着祖国的领空，在同美国空中强盗展开的激烈空战中，勇敢善战，连战皆捷。据统计，仅从今年六月二十九日美国强盗飞机悍然轰炸河内和海防以来，到七月二十一日为止，这支英雄的越南人民空军已经击落美国强盗飞机十一架，取得了巨大的胜利。
    美帝国主义一再吹嘘它的“空中优势”，看不起年轻的越南人民空军。但是，敢于斗争，敢于胜利的越南人民空军勇士们，却把美帝国主义的“空中优势”看成是“纸老虎”。他们向记者说：“决定战争胜负的是人，而不是武器。美国空军也没有什么了不起，我们完全可以打败它！”六月二十九日当美国强盗飞机多批数十架次疯狂袭击河内市的时候，英雄的越南人民空军面对着凶恶的敌人，以少胜多，当场击落了现代化的美国喷气式战斗机两架。接着，他们几乎天天起飞迎战，越战越强，每打必胜。在七月十三日和十四日，又在河西省和兴安省上空，连续击落美机四架。
    七月十七日，胡志明主席发出的伟大战斗号召，更加鼓舞了这些英勇顽强的空军战士们，他们以出色的战斗行动来向自己的领袖表达决心。在十九日和二十一日两次空战中，当即以猛烈的炮火，迎头把三架美国强盗飞机打得粉身碎骨。
    现在这支受到胡志明主席热烈表彰的英雄的人民空军，更加意气风发，斗志昂扬。他们在给胡主席的决心书中保证说：“我们一定坚决实现胡主席的教导，发扬已经取得的胜利，更加英勇顽强地战斗，保卫祖国领空，给一切胆敢侵犯的美国空中强盗以更加沉重的打击，彻底粉碎它的‘空中优势’！”
