Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first and foremost for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for them and used by them." Zhou Yang, however, goes against Mao Zedong Thought. He blathers on about how "the situation today is different from twenty years ago," that the service objects are "much broader than in Yan'an," and that "all the people are the objects of our literary and artistic service and work." Under the guidance of this revisionist "culture for all the people" ideology, he directs his spearhead at the publishing institutions for rural popular readings, employing three vicious tricks: chopping, deceiving, and altering.

Chopping: He successively chopped off the Popular Readings Publishing House, the Science Popularization Publishing House, and many local popular periodicals. When the Popular Readings Publishing House was dissolved, it had six editorial departments, two magazines, one printing workshop, and over 250 staff members. After merging with the People's Publishing House, under the pretext of "better to lack than to have too much" and "strengthening and improving," they merged and reduced, breaking it down into pieces, and crossed out the task of publishing popular readings. Through external investigations, demotions, and streamlining, they forced out the staff, leaving less than one-tenth.

Deceiving: He deceived the central authorities, outwardly waving the banner of restoring "popular readings," while secretly carrying out the scheme to strangle rural readings.

In May 1961, a central leader criticized the dissolution of the Popular Readings Publishing House. Zhou Yang panicked, on one hand lying and feigning ignorance, saying "the Propaganda Department didn't know," shifting the blame; on the other hand, deceiving the central authorities, setting up a grand deception to evade responsibility. Outwardly, he first hung up a sign to restore the Popular Readings Editorial Department, then announced the establishment of the Rural Readings Publishing House; secretly, he did not set policies, did not assign staff, did not allocate paper, did not provide housing, did not solve problems, and let this publishing house self-destruct.

To "organize ancient texts" and translate "foreign" books, Zhou Yang personally recruited talents, over five years assigning over 200 editorial and translation personnel to five publishing houses. However, he showed no interest in strengthening the rural readings publishing team, over five years only gathering 70 staff members. Why was Zhou Yang so cold-hearted and ruthless towards such a publishing house facing the countryside? The truth is, this is Zhou Yang's malicious act of hating the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and opposing Chairman Mao's literary line.

Altering: He changed the policy of rural readings publishing work, installing his loyal henchmen to seize power and rule, turning the Rural Readings Publishing House into a name-only entity, actually serving their capitalist restoration.

Zhou Yang opposed the popular readings publishing work serving proletarian politics, opposed coordinating with the current central tasks, and advocated bourgeois "knowledge." He vigorously promoted famous, foreign, and ancient works.

Zhou Yang has always opposed emphasizing politics and coordinating with the current struggle. He repeatedly gnashed his teeth saying, "Talking about politics at every turn, it's not politics anymore." "Adding politics to everything is not cherishing politics, lacking politics." He directly implemented this anti-party theory into publishing work. Many manuscripts that coordinated with politics and connected with reality were blocked by them. *Class Struggle Knowledge* was chopped off, *Q&A on the Class Struggle in the Countryside* was strangled, and political readings promoting the "Three-Eights Spirit" were also blocked. A few that were reluctantly published were also slandered and cursed by them, such as "rear-end reports," "untenable," "scissors and glue," "low-level publishing method," "similar and haphazard publishing" ... They devalued these popular readings serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers to be worthless.

What Zhou Yang vigorously advocated was bourgeois "knowledge." He blathered on, "In recent years, there has been too much emphasis on ideological reform, and not enough emphasis on knowledge." He even thought that if peasants had culture, the class struggle in the countryside would be extinguished. Therefore, he proposed that "the most central task of publishing work is to publish the *Knowledge Series*." Under his planning, six publishing houses prepared 1,575 topics for the *Knowledge Series*, as they said, "ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign," "flying in the sky, walking on the ground," emperors and generals, talented scholars and beautiful women, famous gardens, flowers, birds, insects, and fish, everything was included, except for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and Mao Zedong Thought.

This anti-party gang of Zhou Yang has been exposed, this is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must cut off his claws reaching into the popular readings publishing work, thoroughly purge all his evil influences, and firmly carry out Chairman Mao's literary line, face the countryside, and serve the broad masses of peasants.

　　周扬扼杀通俗读物的恶毒伎俩
　　——选自农村读物出版社的大字报
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”周扬却同毛泽东思想唱反调。他胡说什么“今天的情况同二十年前不同”，服务对象“比延安时广得多”，“全体人民都是我们文艺服务的对象和工作对象。”在这个修正主义的“全民文化”的思想指导下，他把矛头指向为几亿农民服务的农村读物出版机构，施出了砍、骗、变三套恶毒伎俩。
    砍：就是先后砍掉了通俗读物出版社、科学普及出版社和不少的地方通俗报刊。通俗读物出版社撤销时有六个编辑室，两个杂志，一个印刷车间，二百五十多名干部。合并到人民出版社后不久，就在“宁缺勿滥”“加强提高”的幌子下，合并裁减，化整为零，把出版通俗读物的任务一笔勾销。又通过外调、下放、精简，把干部挤走，留下来的不到十分之一。
    骗：就是欺骗中央，表面打着恢复“通俗读物”的幌子，暗里干着扼杀农村读物的勾当。
    一九六一年五月，中央领导同志对撤销通俗读物出版社这件事提出批评。周扬慌了，一面撒谎装糊涂，说“中宣部不知道”，把责任推掉；一方面蒙蔽中央，设下一个逃避罪责的大骗局。明着一套：先挂牌恢复通俗读物编辑部，后宣布成立农村读物出版社；暗里一套：不定方针，不调干部，不拨纸张，不给房子，不解决问题，任凭这个出版社自行消灭。
    为了“整理古籍”，翻译“洋”书，周扬亲自出马网罗人材，近五年给五家出版社调进二百多个编译人员。可是他对充实农村读物出版队伍却毫无兴趣，五年才拼凑了七十名干部。为什么周扬对面向农村的这样一个出版社如此冷酷无情，百般扼杀呢？说穿了，这正是周扬仇视工农兵，反对毛主席文艺路线的罪恶表现。
    变：就是改变农村读物出版工作的方针，安插他的忠实爪牙来夺权专政，把农村读物出版社办成一个有名无实，实际上是为他们实现资本主义复辟服务的出版社。
    周扬反对通俗读物出版工作为无产阶级政治服务，反对配合当前中心任务，提倡资产阶级的“知识性”，大搞名、洋、古。
    周扬一贯反对突出政治和配合当前斗争。他多次咬牙切齿地说：“开口政治，闭口政治，就不成其为政治了。”“把所有的东西都加上政治，就是不爱惜政治，缺少政治。”他把这套反党理论直接贯彻到出版工作中来。很多配合政治、联系实际的书稿，一到他们那儿就通不过。《阶级斗争知识》被砍掉了，《农村两条道路斗争问答》被扼杀了，讲“三八作风”的政治读物也被卡住了。勉强出版了几本，也遭到了他们的诬蔑和咒骂，什么“报屁股”呀，“站不住”呀，“剪刀和浆糊”，“低级出书法”呀，“大同小异，出得滥”呀……，把这些为工农兵服务的通俗读物贬得一钱不值。
    周扬拚命提倡的又是什么呢？是资产阶级的“知识性”。他胡说：“近几年讲思想改造多了，强调知识不够。”甚至认为农民有了文化，农村的阶级斗争就熄灭了。因此，他提出“出版工作最中心的任务就是出版《知识丛书》。”在他的策划下，六家出版社为《知识丛书》拟定了一千五百七十五个选题，按照他们说的，“古今中外”，“天上飞的，地上走的”，帝王将相，才子佳人，园林名胜，花鸟虫鱼，应有尽有，独独没有工农兵，没有毛泽东思想。
    周扬这个反党黑帮被揪出来了，这是无产阶级文化大革命的一个大胜利。我们要斩断他伸向通俗读物出版工作中的魔爪，彻底肃清他所散布的一切恶劣影响，我们要坚定不移地执行毛主席的文艺路线，面向农村，为广大农民服务。
