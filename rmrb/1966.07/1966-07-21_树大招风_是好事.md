After I was commended as an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, my comrades raised their expectations for me and their criticisms increased. For example, once, a few comrades were eating raw radishes in the vegetable cellar, and I also ate one. At the class meeting, my comrades seriously criticized me. There were also some discussions among my comrades. I felt very troubled, thinking: as the saying goes, "a tall tree attracts wind," which is indeed true. Being an active learner is not easy! I was afraid that the "wind" would blow me over, afraid that the "tree" would fall and hit hard. I developed a mediocre attitude, not seeking achievements but just avoiding mistakes. In my work, I was content with just getting by.

Is "a tall tree attracting wind" a good thing or a bad thing? With the help of my comrades, I studied Chairman Mao's works and realized that eating one radish, which seems like a trivial matter, actually represents a lack of public spirit and opens the green light to "selfishness." It was a defeat in my thoughts. My comrades' criticisms helped me recognize the enemy, stand firm, and undergo a thought revolution. This high standard and strict requirement "wind" is precisely what drives me to reform my thoughts and avoid mistakes. My comrades' criticisms and discussions, though harsh to hear, indicate that I still have many shortcomings. In the past, I was blindly proud of my progress and overestimated myself. After careful self-examination, I found that I had arrogant thoughts, looked down on the platoon leader, and was not respectful enough to my comrades. In some issues, I ignored the "public" and emphasized the "self." The "wind" can awaken one's mind and help find weak points. If my comrades only praised me, it would sound pleasant but be very harmful.

By seeing through the surface phenomena of things and understanding their essence, I overcame the one-sidedness in my understanding and realized that "a tall tree attracting wind" is a great thing. It is my comrades' concern for my politics and their responsibility for my ideological progress. The "wind" my comrades blow on me is what helps me grow. From then on, I was no longer afraid of "a tall tree attracting wind." For a period, the "wind" my comrades blew on me lessened, so I encouraged everyone to blow "wind" at the class meeting and borrowed "wind" during heart-to-heart talks. I believe that the more "wind" I attract, the faster this tree will grow, and the more thorough my ideological revolution will be.

### “树大招风”是好事

    “树大招风”是好事
    南京部队某部炊事班长　郭兴中
    我被评为学习毛主席著作积极分子以后，同志们对我要求高了，对我的批评也多了。比如：有一次，几个同志在菜窖边吃生萝卜，我也吃了一个。班务会上，同志们很严肃地批评了我。同志们中间对我也有些议论。我感到很苦恼，心想：俗话说，“树大招风”，一点不假，积极分子真不好当呵！我怕被招来的“风”刮倒，怕“树”大了倒下来跌得重，就产生了中游思想，不求有功，但求无过。工作上四平八稳，满足于“过得去”就行了。
    “树大招风”，究竟是好事还是坏事呢？在同志们的帮助下，我学习了毛主席著作，认识到我吃一个萝卜，看起来是不值几分钱的小事情，实际上是公私不分，对“私”字开放了绿灯，思想上打了一次败仗。同志们对我的批评，是帮助我认清敌情，站稳立场，进行思想革命。这种高标准、严要求的“风”，正是促使我进行思想改造、不犯错误的“风”。同志们对我的批评和议论，听起来刺耳，但这正说明自己还存在着不少缺点。过去对自己的一点进步陷入盲目性，估计过高。仔细检查以后，我才发现自己存在着骄傲情绪，瞧不起排长，对同志们不够尊重。在一些问题上，撇开了“公”字，突出了“私”字。“风”能够吹醒人的头脑，帮助人找到薄弱环节。如果同志们对我光说奉承话，听起来很舒服，危害却很大。
    透过事物的表面现象，看清了事物的本质，我就克服了认识上的片面性，认识到“树大招风”是一件大好事，是同志们对我政治上的关心，是对我思想上的进步负责。同志们对我吹的都是促使我成长的“风”。从此，我就不怕“树大招风”了。有一阶段，同志们对我吹的“风”少了一些，我就在班务会上鼓励大家吹“风”，在谈心活动中借“风”。我相信，“风”招得多了，我这棵树就成长得越快，思想革命化就越彻底。
