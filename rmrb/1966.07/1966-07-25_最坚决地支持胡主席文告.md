	Most resolutely supporting Chairman Hu's proclamation, we cross rivers and mountains. Our voices, fly quickly to the battling Vietnam, to tell our dear Vietnamese brothers, the Chinese people are determined to support Vietnam to the fullest! Support! Support! Support! Most resolutely supporting Chairman Hu's proclamation, we gather at Tiananmen Square and raise our arms to shout! Endorse! Endorse! Endorse! Most resolutely endorsing Chairman Liu's statement, this is the common wish of 700 million Chinese people! The voices of the two chairmen are like two thunderclaps, shaking the five continents and echoing through the skies! We see— the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices are terrified! We see—their "peace talks" plot has been thoroughly smashed and exposed! The Chinese and Vietnamese peoples are the closest brothers, interdependent and united in flesh and blood; we 700 million people are the backbone of the Vietnamese people, we will always stand by your side! We have already made all preparations, determined to fight side by side with the Vietnamese people! Crossing rivers and mountains, our voices, fly quickly to the battling Vietnam, to tell our dear Vietnamese brothers— as soon as you call, we will immediately be by your side, to fight shoulder to shoulder with you to complete victory, we are ready to sacrifice everything, fearing no risks!

    最坚决地支持胡主席文告穿过江河，跨过高山，我们的心声啊，快快飞到战斗的越南，告诉亲爱的越南兄弟，中国人民誓尽全力支援越南！支持！支持！支持！最坚决地支持胡主席的文告，我们汇集在天安门广场振臂呼喊！拥护！拥护！拥护！最坚决地拥护刘主席的声明，这是七亿中国人民的共同心愿！两国主席的声音是两声巨雷，五洲震荡，响彻云天！我们看见——美帝及其合伙者被吓得心惊肉跳！我们看见——他们的“和谈”阴谋已被彻底粉碎、戳穿！中越人民是最亲密的兄弟，唇齿相依，血肉相连；我们七亿人民是越南人民的后盾，我们永远站在你们一边！我们早已做好一切准备，誓与越南人民并肩作战！穿过江河，跨过高山，我们的心声啊，快快飞到战斗的越南，告诉亲爱的越南兄弟——只要你们一声召唤，我们马上就到你们身边，为了跟你们并肩战斗到彻底胜利，我们不惜一切牺牲，不怕任何风险！
