Vietnamese audience members, after visiting the "Chinese Photo Exhibition" held in Hanoi, wrote many enthusiastic comments. They praised Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party for their brilliant leadership in China's socialist revolution and construction, and for their tremendous contributions to supporting the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary struggles of the world's people. They sincerely wished for Chairman Mao's longevity and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

This exhibition was organized by the Vietnam-China Friendship Association to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party and concluded on the 10th. Despite the evacuation of the population in Hanoi, over 42,000 people from various sectors of Vietnamese society still visited the exhibition with great enthusiasm, braving the heat and the tense atmosphere of battle. A foundry worker from Ha Dong Province, Chen Mei, wrote a passionate poem in the visitor's book:

	"Vast and magnificent China,
	I am overjoyed to see you.
	The red flag of the East,
	Mao Zedong Thought shines over the land,
	I am fortunate to see you in the photos.
	China, you give me confidence in victory,
	You are soaring, a thousand miles a day!"

A technician from the Vietnamese Railway Transport Department, Nguyen Thi Vinh, said after his visit that he had a strong impression: "Mao Zedong Thought has become the compass for the actions of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. Therefore, progress is being made in all aspects, including politics, economy, culture, and science and technology." He wrote in his comments, "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

Many visitors enthusiastically praised the Chinese people for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing politics, and upholding the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. A coal miner from Quang Ninh Province, Chen Yunhe, pointed out in his comments: "The greatness and strength of China fully demonstrate the brilliant leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with Chairman Mao, the beloved leader of the Chinese people, at its helm. The radiant Mao Zedong Thought has nurtured outstanding figures like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, and Mai Xiande, who are symbols of a great and heroic nation advancing on the socialist path."

The broad audience was deeply moved by the Chinese people's high-spirited internationalism in raising the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary cause of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world. A cadre from the Hanoi Commercial Bureau, Nguyen Bat Dat, wrote in his impressions: "The great support and aid filled with proletarian internationalism that China has given to our motherland deeply moves and endlessly gratifies us. In the history of struggling for national liberation and against imperialism, the contributions of the Chinese people should be recorded in gold. Long live Vietnam-China friendship! Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!" He sincerely wished the Chinese people, under the brilliant leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to achieve even greater successes in socialist construction and in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism.

A cadre from the South who was working in North Vietnam, Nguyen Vu Lai, wrote a vivid comment after his visit, illustrating with his personal experience that the aid from the Chinese people to the Vietnamese people was comprehensive and selfless. He enthusiastically praised, "The Chinese people are a steadfast rear guard for the Vietnamese people in their struggle against the American aggressors, and are the most enthusiastic and steadfast comrades-in-arms of the Vietnamese people." Worker Vu Thuong Truong also wrote: "The Vietnamese people have already received and are continuing to receive the wholehearted support and aid from the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people in their struggle against American aggression for national salvation. Chinese comrades often say that no matter how much the U.S. imperialists expand the war, no matter what risks and sacrifices they have to bear, the Chinese people are determined to support the Vietnamese people until they achieve complete victory. All this deeply moves and greatly gratifies me."

Many visitors expressed their boundless admiration for Chairman Mao in simple and sincere language in their comments and expressed the Vietnamese people's resolve to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors. Worker Trinh Ngoc Du wrote in his comments: "The greatness and brilliance of Chairman Mao are already manifest in the actual actions of supporting our Vietnamese people. We believe that with the boundless enthusiasm of the People's Republic of China, our national liberation cause will surely achieve victory!"

The exhibition's organizers told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that this exhibition has powerfully inspired the Vietnamese military and people, who are in the midst of battle, to strike even harder blows against the American aggressors.

    据新华社河内十五日电　越南广大观众参观了在河内举办的“中国图片展览”后，写下了许多热情的留言，赞颂毛主席和中国共产党英明领导着中国人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中取得的伟大成就，在支援越南人民和世界人民的革命斗争事业中作出的巨大贡献。他们衷心敬祝伟大的毛主席万寿无疆，高呼“毛主席万岁！”“毛泽东思想万岁！”
    这个展览是越中友好协会为庆祝中国共产党成立四十五周年举办的，已经在十日闭幕。在展出的短短十天里，虽然河内市人口进行疏散，但是，仍有四万二千多越南各界人民，怀着极大的热情，冒着酷暑，在紧张的战斗气氛中，踊跃观看了展览。一位来自河东省的翻砂工人陈梅览在观众留言簿上写下激情的诗篇：
      “辽阔和雄伟的中国啊，
    我万分高兴地看到您。
    东方革命的红旗，

    您呀，正在展翅飞翔，一日千里！”
    越南铁路运输部门的一位技师阮世永说，他参观后一个突出的感觉是：“毛泽东思想已经成为中国共产党和中国人民一切行动的指南针。因此，在政治、经济、文化、科学技术等各方面都日益进步。”他在留言中高呼“毛泽东思想万岁！”
    许多观众热情洋溢地颂扬中国人民活学活用毛泽东思想，坚持突出政治，发扬自力更生的革命精神。广宁省煤矿工人陈云河在留言中指出：“中国的伟大和强盛，充分体现了以中国人民敬爱的天才的领袖毛主席为首的中国共产党的英明领导。光芒四射的毛泽东思想哺育出来的雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄和麦贤得等优秀儿女，是正在沿着社会主义大道前进的一个伟大和英雄的民族的象征。”
    广大观众为中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全心全力地支援越南人民和世界人民的革命事业的崇高无产阶级国际主义精神所感动。河内市商业局干部阮必达在观后感中写道：“中国对我们祖国的充满无产阶级国际主义精神的巨大支持和援助，使我们深受感动和无限感激。在争取民族解放和反对帝国主义的斗争历史上，中国人民的贡献要用金字来记载。越中友谊万古常青！中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！”他“真诚地敬祝中国人民在中国共产党的英明领导下，在社会主义建设和反对帝国主义、现代修正主义的斗争中，取得更多更加巨大的成就。”
    在越南北方工作的一位南方集结干部阮友来在参观后，用他自己亲身经历的事实写了一篇生动的留言，说明中国人民对越南人民的援助是全面和无私的。他热烈赞扬“中国人民是越南人民抗击美国侵略者的坚强后盾”，“是越南人民独一无二的最热情和最坚定的战友。”工人吴寿忠也写道：“越南人民在抗美救国斗争中已经和正在得到中国共产党、中国政府和人民的全心全力的支持和援助。中国同志们还经常说，不管美帝国主义把战争扩大到什么程度，不管要冒多大风险和要付出多大代价，中国人民也决心支援越南人民，直到取得完全胜利。这些都使我非常感动和深深感激。”
    许多观众在留言中用生动而朴实的语言，表达自己对毛主席的无限敬爱，并表示越南人民决心彻底打败美国侵略强盗的坚强意志。工人郑玉游在留言中写道：“毛主席的伟大，毛主席的英明，在支援我们越南人民的实际行动中已经体现出来。我们相信，在伟大的中华人民共和国的无限热情的支援下，我们的民族解放事业一定取得胜利！”
    展览馆的负责人告诉新华社记者说，这次展出，有力地鼓舞着正在战斗中的越南军民更加沉重地打击美国侵略强盗。
