Pathet Lao Radio Denounces Indian and Canadian Representatives as Accomplices in U.S. Aggression
Demands Complete Halt to Activities of the International Control Commission in Laos

KANGPHANG, July 21 (Xinhua) — Pathet Lao Radio broadcasted a commentary on July 20, exposing the crimes of the Indian and Canadian representatives in the International Control Commission in Laos, who have been serving U.S. imperialism's aggression against Laos. The commentary demands a complete halt to the activities of the International Control Commission in Laos.

The commentary stated that the Indian and Canadian representatives in the International Control Commission have repeatedly abused the name of the commission, colluding with the United States to violate the Geneva Agreement on Laos. They have systematically intensified their policy of aggression against Laos. They have distorted the facts in Laos, covered up U.S. aggression, infringed upon Laos' sovereignty, and disrupted the principle of unity among the three political forces in Laos. They have also undermined the working principles within the International Control Commission. The despicable actions of the Indian and Canadian representatives have not only prevented the International Control Commission from properly fulfilling its duties and responsibilities but have also turned the commission into a tool for serving U.S. interference and aggression in Laos.

The commentary said that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front had, on July 23, 1965, issued a statement emphasizing that "it is time to consider halting the activities of the International Control Commission in Laos." However, over the past year, the Indian and Canadian representatives have stubbornly continued to use the name of the International Control Commission to engage in activities that contradict the Geneva Agreement, infringing upon Laos' sovereignty and independence.

The commentary pointed out that as the United States increasingly strengthens and expands its aggression, intensifying its aerial bombing and strafing of liberated areas, and even using B-52 strategic bombers to brutally massacre our compatriots, not only our people but also progressive public opinion around the world have angrily condemned it. However, the Indian and Canadian representatives not only dare not utter a word of protest but also try to act as accomplices to the United States. The activities of the International Control Commission, as stipulated by the Geneva Agreement, have already expired. The Indian and Canadian representatives deliberately ignore the Lao Patriotic Front's suggestion to consider halting the activities of the International Control Commission, and their actions of aiding the aggressors and seriously violating the Geneva Agreement have made the International Control Commission lose its reason for existence in Laos.

The commentary said that we hope that countries that truly respect and correctly implement the Geneva Agreement on Laos, especially the sincere participants of the Geneva Conference on Laos and countries that genuinely hope for the early stabilization of the situation in Laos, will take necessary measures together with the Lao people and the Lao Patriotic Front. Based on the spirit and provisions of Article 19 of the Geneva Protocol, they should completely halt the activities of the International Control Commission in Laos.

### 巴特寮电台谴责印加代表充当美帝侵略帮凶  要求全部停止老挝国际委员会活动

    巴特寮电台谴责印加代表充当美帝侵略帮凶
    要求全部停止老挝国际委员会活动
    新华社康开二十一日电　巴特寮电台二十日广播一篇评论，揭露老挝国际委员会中的印度和加拿大代表为美帝国主义侵略老挝战争效劳的罪行，要求全部停止老挝国际委员会的活动。
    评论说，国际委员会中的印度和加拿大代表接连滥用国际委员会的名义，伙同美国违反关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，有系统地加紧推行对老挝的侵略政策。他们歪曲老挝的真相，包庇美国的侵略行动；侵犯老挝的主权和破坏老挝三种政治力量一致的原则；破坏国际委员会内部的工作原则。印度和加拿大代表的卑鄙行动，不仅使国际委员会不能正确履行它的职权和任务，而且把国际委员会变成了为美国对老挝的干涉和侵略政策效劳的工具。
    评论说，老挝爱国战线党中央在一九六五年七月二十三日曾发表声明强调指出，“到了应该考虑停止老挝国际委员会的活动的时候了”。但是，一年来印度和加拿大代表仍然顽固地披着国际委员会的外衣，继续干着同日内瓦协议背道而驰、侵犯老挝主权和独立的勾当。
    评论指出，在美国日益加强和扩大侵略战争，加强用空军日益疯狂轰炸、扫射解放区，甚至用B—52型战略轰炸机极其野蛮地大批杀害我国同胞的情况下，不仅我国人民，连全世界进步舆论都愤怒地谴责它。然而，印度和加拿大代表不仅不敢提出半句抗议，反而还设法当美国的帮凶。由日内瓦协议所规定的国际委员会的活动时间已经期满，印度和加拿大代表蓄意对老挝爱国战线党关于考虑停止国际委员会的活动的建议置之不理，尤其是印度和加拿大代表帮助侵略者、严重破坏日内瓦协议的行动，使国际委员会失去了在老挝存在的理由。
    评论说，我们希望真正尊重和正确履行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的国家，首先是关于老挝问题日内瓦会议的有诚意的与会国和真正希望老挝局势早日得到稳定的国家，同老挝人民和老挝爱国战线党一起，采取必要的措施，根据日内瓦议定书第十九条的精神和条款，全部停止老挝国际委员会的活动。
