After Comrade Liu Yingjun's glorious sacrifice, the party branch asked me to take over the lantern slide work he had been responsible for and continue it. When I took over the tools he used, such as pens, paper, and colors, I couldn't help but recall the days I spent with him.

Comrade Liu Yingjun had a clear purpose in making lantern slides. He often said, "We must keep up with the situation. If we fall behind, we cannot play the fighting role of lantern slides." He had the "situation" in his heart and was particularly sensitive to materials that could be used to make lantern slides. Every day when the newspaper came, he was always the first to pick it up from the company office to read. If he found a topic that could be drawn, he would immediately copy it down. Whenever the newspaper published statements by Chairman Mao supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, new developments in the international anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles, new victories in the Vietnamese people's anti-American struggle, new models appearing throughout the country and the army, etc., he would seize every opportunity to rush to make lantern slides. Sometimes, when the political instructor gave him the task of making a set of lantern slides, he had already finished them and immediately brought them out for the company leaders to review. The lantern slides he made about the deeds of Comrades Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Jiao Yulu were almost all finished before the company started the learning activities.

Throughout his lantern slide work, Comrade Liu Yingjun consistently followed a red line: promoting Mao Zedong Thought. He paid great attention to the propaganda of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The lantern slide "Lei Feng" he made prominently propagated Lei Feng's deeds of diligently studying Chairman Mao's works. The lantern slide "The Story of Liu Xiangjun and Hou Youxin's 'Red Pair'" he drew also propagated their deeds of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Before making each set of lantern slides, he would carefully study the relevant works of Chairman Mao to arm his mind first. Even in situations where the task was heavy and time was tight, this was no exception. He said, "Educators must first be educated, propagandists must first be propagandized. Only when we understand Mao Zedong Thought can we propagate Mao Zedong Thought well." In the latter half of 1965, when the army carried out socialist education, he first studied with me the relevant discussions by Chairman Mao on class and class struggle, raised our ideological understanding and class consciousness, and finally incorporated the several quotations we studied into the lantern slide commentary. Sometimes, when we used ready-made lantern materials, he would also carefully select a few quotations from Chairman Mao and include them in the commentary. At the same time, he would also quote a passage from Chairman Mao at the beginning and end. He often told me, "Let comrades hear Chairman Mao's words at any time and place." Many comrades said, "We have received education in Mao Zedong Thought through watching lantern slides."

Comrade Liu Yingjun showed a high sense of political responsibility in making lantern slides and overcame one difficulty after another. At the beginning, the company did not have lantern equipment, so he and a few cultural cadres used some discarded materials, hammering and smashing them day after day, and spent several months of spare time making a lantern projector. When the local area did not sell a condenser lens, he wrote letters everywhere, asking relatives and friends to help purchase it. Making lantern slides required hard paper frames, so he and the cadres searched everywhere for hard paper and pasted it together. To make the lantern slides well, he learned from the projectionist of the regiment many times. To let everyone receive education in a timely manner, he often got up early and stayed up late to rush, forgetting to sleep and eat. Last year, after Wang Jie's deeds were published in the newspaper, he took the newspaper and said to me, "This is another Lei Feng of our era, a good soldier of Chairman Mao. We should learn from Comrade Wang Jie, and also let all the comrades in the company learn from him through lantern slides." At that time, it was already midnight, but Liu Yingjun was still leaning over a small table drawing lantern slides to propagate Wang Jie. The deputy squad leader of the second squad, Wang Chunming, who was on duty, carelessly said to him, "Go to rest quickly, you have a shift tomorrow!" Liu Yingjun said, "This set of lantern slides will be shown tomorrow night, if I don't rush it out tonight, the comrades won't be able to see it tomorrow." In this way, from March 1965 to March 1966, he made a total of 23 sets of lantern slides.

Last year, our company was dispersed in six or seven places to perform duties. To let every comrade in the company see the lantern slides and receive education, he often did not hesitate to carry the lantern projector and go from one point to another for mobile projection. There was a production team with only three people, more than twenty miles away from the company, and he also went there specially for projection. He said, "We are propagating Mao Zedong Thought. The more people who see it, the more people who will receive education in Mao Zedong Thought." (Attached photo)

Comrade Liu Yingjun often carried this lantern projector to project lantern slides for comrades at outposts dozens of miles away from the company and nearby factories and schools. This is Liu Yingjun's comrade introducing to comrades the deeds of Liu Yingjun using lantern slides to propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Liu Yingjun made more than 400 lantern slides during his lifetime. This is the small wooden box he made for lantern slides and some of the lantern slides.

　　一颗红心宣传毛泽东思想  一支红笔描绘时代的英雄
　　——忆刘英俊同志怎样开展幻灯工作
　　战士　魏吉华
    刘英俊同志光荣牺牲以后，党支部让我把他生前担负的幻灯工作接过来，继续开展下去。当我接过他使用的笔、纸、颜色等工具时，不由得回忆起和他相处的那些日子来。
    刘英俊同志搞幻灯，有明确的目的。他经常说：“咱们一定要紧跟形势，跟不上形势，就不能发挥幻灯的战斗作用了。”他心里装着“形势”，对可以绘制幻灯片的素材特别敏感。每天报纸一来，他总是第一个到连部取来阅读，发现能画的题材，就及时抄下来。凡是报纸上刊登毛主席支持世界各国人民革命斗争的声明，国际上反帝反修斗争的新发展，越南人民反美斗争的新胜利，全国全军出现的新典型，等等，他都能抓紧一切空隙赶制幻灯片。有时，指导员向他布置编画一部幻灯片时，他早已画好，马上拿出来请连首长审查。他绘制的王杰、麦贤得、焦裕禄等同志的事迹幻灯片，几乎都是在连队开展学习活动以前就画好的。
    刘英俊同志在开展幻灯工作中，始终贯穿着一条红线，就是宣传毛泽东思想。他非常重视活学活用毛主席著作的宣传。他绘制的幻灯片《雷锋》，突出地宣传雷锋同志刻苦学习毛主席著作的事迹。他画的幻灯片《刘祥君和侯有新“一对红”的故事》，也是宣传他俩活学活用毛主席著作的事迹。他绘制每一部幻灯片之前，都要认真地学习毛主席的有关著作，先武装自己的头脑。即使是在任务重、时间紧的情况下也不例外。他说：“教育者要先受教育，宣传员要先受宣传。只有我们领会好毛泽东思想，才能宣传好毛泽东思想。”一九六五年下半年，部队进行社会主义教育，他首先和我一起学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的有关论述，提高思想认识和阶级觉悟，最后，把我们学习的几条语录一一编入了幻灯解说词里。有的时候，我们选用现成的幻灯材料，他也要精选几条毛主席语录，编在解说词里。同时，在开头和结尾的地方，也都引用一段毛主席的话。他常对我说：要让同志们随时随地听到毛主席的话。许多同志都说：我们通过看幻灯，受到了毛泽东思想的教育。
    刘英俊同志搞幻灯，表现了高度的政治责任心，克服了一个又一个困难。开始，连队没有幻灯设备，他就和几个文娱骨干用一些废旧器材，今天敲敲，明天砸砸，前后花了几个月的课余时间，制成了一架幻灯机。驻地买不到聚光镜，他四处写信，请亲友帮助购买。做幻灯片需要硬纸框，他和骨干们到处搜集硬纸把它剪贴起来。为了把幻灯片画好，他多次向团里放映员学习。为了让大家及时受到教育，他经常早起晚睡地赶，废寝忘食地画。去年，王杰的事迹在报纸上发表后，他拿着报纸对我说：“这是我们时代的又一个雷锋，是毛主席的好战士，咱们要向王杰同志学习，也要通过幻灯，让全连同志都向他学习。”当时，已是深夜十二点了，刘英俊还趴在小桌上画宣传王杰的幻灯片。带哨的二班副班长王春明关心地对他说：“快休息吧，天亮还有你一班岗呢！”刘英俊却说：“明天晚上就要放这部幻灯片，今晚不赶出来，明天同志们就看不上了。”就这样，从一九六五年三月，到一九六六年三月，他先后绘制了二十三部幻灯片。
    去年，我们连分散在六七处执行勤务，他为了让连队每个同志看到幻灯，受到教育，经常不辞劳苦地背着幻灯机，一个点一个点地巡回放映。有个生产组只有三个人，远离连队二十多里，他也专门前去放映。他说：“我们是宣传毛泽东思想的，多一个人看，就多一个人受毛泽东思想的教育。”（附图片）
    刘英俊同志经常背着这台幻灯机，为远离连队几十里的执勤点上的同志和附近的工厂、学校放映幻灯。这是刘英俊的战友向同志们介绍刘英俊利用幻灯宣传毛泽东思想的事迹。
