Chairman Mao's self-reliance thought, which summarizes the rich experiences of the Chinese revolution and revolutions in various countries, is a great strategic thought. This thought is increasingly resonating with people worldwide and has become a powerful weapon for revolutionary peoples in their struggles for revolution and the defense of independence. The peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America universally praise Chairman Mao's strategic thought of self-reliance for its important guiding significance in their revolutionary struggles. Based on their personal experiences in revolutionary struggles, they increasingly deeply feel that the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries must first and foremost rely on the strength of the masses of their own country.

	The legal secretary of the Congolese (Brazzaville) Trade Union Federation, Floran Maranda, recently said that Chairman Mao Zedong's thought of self-reliance should be the guiding ideology for all countries struggling for national liberation and economic independence.

	The representative of the Revolutionary Committee of Mozambique in Cairo, Sitole, said: "The Chinese people have achieved great successes by applying Mao Zedong Thought and the principle of self-reliance in practice."

	The people of South Vietnam and Laos, who have achieved victory after victory in their anti-American struggles, have mainly relied on the strength of their own people and waged a people's war, defeating American imperialism and making it bleed.

	The statement of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam says: "The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has always mainly relied on its own strength and capabilities."

	Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, emphasized in an article in April this year that the anti-American national salvation struggle of the Lao people is a continuation of the 20-year national liberation struggle and a long-term and arduous struggle of the entire people, a struggle that is based on the principle of relying on their own strength and is bound to be victorious.

	The nationalist parties of the unliberated countries in Africa stated in a joint memorandum submitted to the Second Conference of African Heads of State that for each unliberated country in Africa, "for the sake of Africa, we should always consider this harsh and universal fact: the liberation of a country is first and foremost the cause of the people of that country, the result of their own efforts and sacrifices."

	The leaders of the patriotic armed forces of the Congo (Leopoldville) pointed out at a meeting held at the end of last year that the soldiers and people of the Congolese (Leopoldville) patriotic armed forces, based on their own struggle practice, have come to realize that the revolution is their own affair and that the struggle must first rely on their own strength.

	The Chairman of the South West Africa People's Organization, C. J. Kijazi, said: "I believe that only through our own struggle can we achieve independence, and there is no other solution."

	In the Dominican Republic, the organ of the "June 14th Revolutionary Movement," the "June 14th Daily," published an article saying: "We of the June 14th Movement completely believe in and rely on the fighting ability of the masses of the people," "The strength of the United States cannot decide everything; what decides everything is the masses of the people."

    非洲未独立国家各民族主义政党在向第二次非洲国家首脑会议提出的联合备忘录中说，对于每一个非洲未独立国家来说，“为了非洲的利益，我们应该经常考虑这一严酷和普遍的事实：一个国家的解放，首先是这个国家人民的事业，是他们自己的努力和牺牲的结果。”
