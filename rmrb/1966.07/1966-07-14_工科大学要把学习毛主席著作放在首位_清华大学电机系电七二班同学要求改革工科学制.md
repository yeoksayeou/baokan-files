The seven students from Renmin University of China have expressed our desire to resolutely, thoroughly, and swiftly smash the old education system. We fully agree with their views. Additionally, based on the characteristics of engineering universities, we would like to add a few opinions.

Dear Central Committee of the Party, Dear Chairman Mao: We believe that the ten crimes listed by the seven students from Renmin University of China also exist in engineering universities. It takes six years to graduate from our university, plus six years of primary school and six years of middle school, a total of eighteen years. Eighteen years of hard study have wasted our best youth for the Party. We have already studied for five years at the university, but what skills have we actually learned? We are called fifth-year students in the Department of Electrical Engineering, but we cannot even repair a broken electric motor. Under the guise of pursuing the forefront and focusing on theory, our studies have become severely detached from reality. We can no longer tolerate this evil education system and its continued poisoning of us. We must resolutely overthrow it and completely break with the old educational thoughts and old educational systems. Therefore, we propose:

1. All engineering universities should fully implement a half-work, half-study education system. The curriculum should be changed to two, three, or four years based on Chairman Mao's instructions and the needs of the state, and a certain amount of time should be allocated each year to participate in class struggles and military training in society.

2. Engineering universities must also prioritize class struggle as the main course and place the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront. All subjects should be guided by Mao Zedong Thought.

3. Once the Cultural Revolution is over, we should be allowed to graduate early and be assigned to the three great revolutionary movements, to permanently and unconditionally combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, especially to immediately participate in the front lines of class struggle and the socialist education movement in urban and rural areas.

4. In the future, the teaching of engineering universities should focus on production practice, learning from practice, and learning from workers, with teachers providing appropriate guidance.

5. Current teachers must go through the three great revolutionary movements to temper themselves and thoroughly reform their thinking. In the future, teachers in engineering universities should also be producers and workers.

6. Completely abolish the current graduate student system. In the future, outstanding individuals should be selected from the three great revolutionary movements for further study.

7. In the future, engineering universities should select students who have been tempered in the three great revolutionary movements, have progressive political thoughts, and have a certain level of cultural education. It is not necessary to have a high school diploma, ensuring that outstanding individuals from the broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and demobilized soldiers can enroll.

Dear Central Committee of the Party, Dear Chairman Mao: We must always remember your teachings and go to the masses' movements and the revolutionary storms to temper and grow ourselves, forging ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. The cause of the proletarian revolution requires our generation to carry it forward. We must pass on and carry forward Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely revolutionize, and always revolutionize. We must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dedicating everything we have to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!

Long live our most beloved leader and teacher, Chairman Mao!

Respectfully submitted by all students of Class 72 in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University.

　　工科大学要把学习毛主席著作放在首位
　　清华大学电机系电七二班同学要求改革工科学制
    中国人民大学七位同学给您的信，说出了我们要求坚决、彻底、迅速地砸烂旧教育制度的心愿。我们完全赞成他们的观点。另外，根据我们工科大学的特点，补充几点意见。
    敬爱的党中央，敬爱的毛主席：我们认为中国人民大学七位同学列举文科大学的十条罪状，在工科大学同样存在。我们清华大学要念六年才能毕业，加上六年小学、六年中学，长达十八年。十八年寒窗，耽误了我们为党工作的大好青春。我们已经读了五年大学，但是到底学到了些什么本领呢？美其名曰电机系五年级学生，可是我们现在连一台电动机坏了也不会修理。在攻尖端、搞理论的幌子下，使我们的学习严重地脱离实际。我们再也不能容忍这种罪恶的学制及教育制度来继续毒害我们了，要坚决打倒它，彻底与旧的教育思想、旧的教育制度决裂。因此我们建议：
    一、所有的工科大学，完全实行半工半读的教育制度。学制应该根据毛主席的指示和国家的需要改为二年、三年、四年，并且每年拿出一定的时间参加社会上的阶级斗争和军事训练等。
    二、工科大学也必须以阶级斗争为主课，把学习毛主席著作放在首位，各门功课都要以毛主席思想为指导。
    三、这次文化大革命一结束，尽可能让我们提前毕业，分配到三大革命运动中去，长期地、无条件地与工农兵相结合，尤其要求立即参加到阶级斗争的第一线，参加城乡的社会主义教育运动。
    四、今后工科大学的教学应以生产实践为主，向实践学习，向工人学习，教师适当辅导。
    五、现在的教师必须到三大革命运动中去锻炼，彻底地改造思想。今后工科大学的教师应该同时是生产者、是工人。
    六、彻底废除现行的研究生制度。今后要在三大革命运动中选拔优秀人物继续深造。
    七、今后工科大学应选拔在三大革命运动中经过锻炼，政治思想进步，具有一定文化水平的青年入学，不一定非高中毕业不可，保证广大工人、贫下中农和复员军人中的优秀分子能够入学。
    敬爱的党中央，敬爱的毛主席：我们要永远牢牢地记住您的教导，到群众运动中去，到革命的大风大浪中去锻炼成长，把自己造就成无产阶级革命事业的接班人。无产阶级的革命事业要我们这一代继往开来，我们一定要把毛泽东思想接过来，传下去，坚决革命，永远革命。我们要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为中国革命和世界革命贡献我们的一切！
    祝我们最最敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席万寿无疆！
                  清华大学电机系电七二班全体同学敬上
