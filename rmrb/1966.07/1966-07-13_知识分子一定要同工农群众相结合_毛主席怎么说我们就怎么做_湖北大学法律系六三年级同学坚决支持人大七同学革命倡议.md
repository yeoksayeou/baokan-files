Intellectuals Must Unite with Workers and Peasants
We Will Do as Chairman Mao Says
Students of the Class of 1963, Law Department, Hubei University Fully Support the Revolutionary Initiative of Peking University Class of 1967

To the Dearest Party Central Committee and Dearest Chairman Mao:

The letter from seven students of Peking University to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao expresses the heartfelt sentiments of revolutionary youth nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. We fully support this revolutionary initiative and resolutely respond to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao to venture into the three great revolutionary movements and temper ourselves in the fiery class struggle.

The old educational system is a breeding ground for revisionism. For a long time, bourgeois "authorities" have used it to stubbornly resist Mao Zedong Thought, blocking the broad masses of youth from tempering themselves in the three great revolutionary movements, and preventing intellectuals from uniting with the workers and peasants. People educated in this way cannot carry on the Chinese revolution, let alone shoulder the responsibility of world revolution.

Chairman Mao has long taught us that intellectuals must unite with the workers and peasants, and that intellectuals must become revolutionary and labor-oriented. However, for more than a decade since liberation, the educational system has not been thoroughly reformed and has not truly followed Chairman Mao's instructions. Now, we must thoroughly break all the rules and regulations that shackle our thoughts and revolutionize them, paving the way to cultivate strong revolutionary successors.

Dear Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: We are all children of workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres. We will resolutely act according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Whatever you say, we will do. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the Chinese revolution through to the end, and carry the world revolution through to the end!

Long live the dearest revolutionary leader, Chairman Mao, for ten thousand years!

    知识分子一定要同工农群众相结合
    毛主席怎么说我们就怎么做
　　湖北大学法律系六三年级同学坚决支持人大七同学革命倡议最敬爱的党中央最敬爱的毛主席：
    中国人民大学七位同学给党中央和毛主席的信，说出了在毛泽东思想哺育下的革命青年的心里话，我们坚决支持这一革命的倡议，坚决响应党和毛主席的号召，到三大革命运动中去闯，到火热的阶级斗争中去锻炼。
    旧的教育制度是培育修正主义的温床。长期以来，资产阶级“权威”利用它顽固地同毛泽东思想相对抗，阻止广大青年到三大革命运动中去锻炼，阻止知识分子与工农群众相结合。这样培养出来的人，接不了中国革命的班，更不能担当世界革命的重任。
    毛主席早就教导我们，知识分子要与工农群众相结合，知识分子要革命化劳动化。但是，解放十多年来，教育制度并没有彻底改革，没有真正按毛主席的指示办事。现在，我们要彻底打破束缚我们思想革命化的一切清规戒律，为培养坚强的革命接班人闯出一条路来。
    敬爱的党中央和毛主席：我们都是工人、农民、革命干部的子弟，我们坚决按照党中央和毛主席的指示办事。您怎么说，我们就怎么做。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把中国革命进行到底！把世界革命进行到底！
    祝最敬爱的革命导师毛主席万寿无疆！
            湖北大学法律系六三年级全体同学
                          一九六六年七月十二日
