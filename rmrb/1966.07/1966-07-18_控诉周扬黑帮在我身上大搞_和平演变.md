I want to accuse and expose the black gang in the literary and artistic circles, headed by Zhou Yang, and their henchmen, of how they turned me from a twelve-year-old Young Pioneer into a bourgeois successor.

At the age of twelve, I was sent by the Cultural Bureau of Xiamen to study at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music Middle School. Under the Party's education, I had some revolutionary aspirations and quickly joined the Communist Youth League. Because of my good skills, I was noticed by the black gang. They openly opposed Chairman Mao's five conditions for cultivating proletarian successors, using the bait of pursuing big, foreign, and classical works and overseas competitions to lure me onto the path of individual struggle and personal fame, aiming to cultivate bourgeois successors.

When I entered the middle school, the anti-party black gang member He Luting often told me, "Study hard, improve your artistic cultivation, and you will have achievements in the future." In 1962, when I returned to China after winning an award, the black gang member Lin Mo Han personally told me, "Just focus on your professional studies." He also boasted about how he studied hard in his youth, watching three American movies a day, and so on.

Over the years, how did they poison me?

They invited a large number of foreign experts who advocated bourgeois humanism, humanitarianism, class reconciliation, and who were obsessed with money and lived a bourgeois life to "cultivate" me. They specially provided me with a piano room and a piano, and under the pretext of caring for performers, they did not give me the opportunity to go to the countryside to interact with workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time. They kept me in an "ivory tower," creating a virtual isolation, so that I had no thoughts or feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Starting from the age of fourteen, I had to practice the piano for eight to ten hours a day, spending the whole day in the piano room, immersed in big, foreign, and classical works, researching and experiencing the emotions of the bourgeois nobility and young masters and misses of the 18th and 19th centuries. Of course, it is very difficult for a young person living in a new society to understand these things. Therefore, they required me to read a large number of Western classical novels, appreciate foreign records, and appreciate nature. I often felt distressed because I could not express these feelings. During the day, it was big, foreign, and classical, and at night, I dreamt of big, foreign, and classical, making me feel like an idiot, my head numb.

At first, I felt very bitter, but when I thought about how they would send me abroad to compete if I practiced well, with fame and wealth, I was willing again. At that time, my mind was full of bourgeois and revisionist politics and national affairs!

At the age of eighteen, I graduated from middle school, and the black gang eagerly sent me abroad for further study, letting me be further influenced by bourgeois and revisionist ideologies.

The Zhou Yang gang, in order to poison me, heavily promoted material incentives, which is to say, money is the key. During my middle school years, apart from the meal allowance, I only had six yuan of pocket money per month. However, after returning to China in 1962 with an award, under Zhou Yang's instructions, Xia Yan wanted me to stay at the Minzu Hotel (I did not want to go), and later gave me five yuan per day for living expenses, asking me to eat at high-end restaurants. When performing in Shanghai and Guangzhou, they asked me to stay at the highest-level hotels and also asked me to go for a rest cure. They gave me royalties of over a thousand yuan twice. A student, from six yuan a month to five yuan a day, to over a thousand yuan in income, the mind must change, and bourgeois and revisionist thoughts must grow.

In terms of artistic ideology, I was even more deeply poisoned. Zhou Yang, under the pretext of "learning all good foreign arts," asked me to perform foreign repertoires, blatantly opposing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line.

Over the years, the repertoires I learned, performed, and competed with were ninety-nine percent big, foreign, and classical, propagating bourgeois ideas of death, dreams, and love. The few Chinese works, such as "The Mermaid," were also revisionist variants.

In 1964, the cultural revolution was pressing, but Zhou Yang, the "patriarch," played various tricks, asking me to defend the big, foreign, and classical front.

Lin Mo Han and his gang said, "You must first do well in big, foreign, and classical, and then criticize," "Doing big, foreign, and classical is translation work, do more of it."

In 1964 and 1965, I participated in the socialist education movement in rural areas. Through living, working, and eating with the poor and lower-middle peasants, my class consciousness was raised, and I had some desire to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, creating small pieces like "New Rural Songs." The black gang was furious, saying that I was not doing my job properly, and they harassed me in every way.

In early 1964, during the music and dance conference, He Luting called me to the Minzu Hotel and asked me what I had been doing recently. I said, "Exploring the three transformations of the piano and creating works." He criticized me, saying, "Don't mess around with people doing great leaps forward and revolutionary works, these are grand unisons, simplifications! You just practice your piano (referring to big, foreign, and classical)!"

Lin Mo Han, after listening to my performance, said, "Don't always play those tense pieces, play more lyrical pieces."

Zhou Yang, you, the head of the black gang, are playing the conductor's baton behind the scenes, letting your henchmen and running dogs extend their black hands across the country. You instructed your followers, Lin Mo Han, Xia Yan, He Luting, and others to implement "peaceful evolution" on me. Today is the day to settle accounts with you, and I accuse you of your anti-party crimes.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm is still a long, tortuous, and sometimes very intense struggle. The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview."

The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for the next generation is an important part of the class struggle throughout the socialist era.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Everything should be based on the interests of the people," requiring us to temper and grow in the midst of great storms and waves.

But you, based on the interests of your anti-party clique, do not care about the lives of billions of Chinese people, squandering the people's money to cultivate your successors, letting me become a tool for your capitalist restoration. For more than a decade, you have been constantly struggling with our Party for the younger generation.

Today, Chairman Mao has saved me from the quagmire of revisionism, and Chairman Mao's thoughts have enlightened my heart, making me aware. I have seen through the black hearts of you, the anti-party elements.

I will firmly grasp the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought and, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, expose and overthrow Zhou Yang, the head of the literary and artistic black gang. We must thoroughly smash your "hell" and resolutely and thoroughly clean up the poison you have spread across the country, in our troupe, and in me!

　　控诉周扬黑帮在我身上大搞“和平演变”
　　中央乐团　殷承宗
    我要控诉和揭发文艺界黑帮头子周扬及他们的爪牙，怎样把我从一个十二岁的少先队员“培养”成一个资产阶级的接班人。
    十二岁那年，我被厦门文化局送到上海音乐学院附中学习。在党的教育下，我有了一定的革命要求，很快就加入了共青团。由于我的业务好，被黑帮们看中了。他们公然反对毛主席提出的培养无产阶级接班人的五项条件，以搞大、洋、古和出国比赛做诱饵，把我引上个人奋斗、成名成家的邪路，以达到他们培养资产阶级接班人的目的。
    在我进附中时，反党黑帮分子贺绿汀就多次跟我说：“要好好学习，提高艺术修养，将来才会有成就。”一九六二年我得奖回国，黑帮分子林默涵亲自对我说：“你把业务学习好就行了。”他还宣扬他在青年时代如何好学习，一天看三个美国电影，等等。
    几年来，他们是怎样毒害我的呢？
    请来大批宣扬资产阶级人性论、人道主义、阶级调和论和满脑子钞票挂帅，过着资产阶级生活的外国专家“培养”我。他们专门给我一间琴房、一架钢琴，并借照顾演奏家的手为名，长期不给我下乡与工农兵接触的机会。把我关在“象牙之塔”里，形成一个变相的隔离，使我根本没有工农兵的思想感情。
    从十四岁开始，我就不得不经常每天练琴八至十小时，整天泡在琴房里，泡在大、洋、古里，去钻研、体会十八、十九世纪资产阶级贵族、少爷小姐的感情。当然对一个生活在新社会的青少年来讲，是很难体会这些东西的。因此，他们就要求我大量地去阅读西欧古典小说，欣赏洋唱片，欣赏大自然。我经常为着表现不出这种感情而苦恼。白天是大、洋、古，夜里做梦还是大、洋、古，把我搞得象个傻子，脑袋都麻木了。
    开始觉得很苦，但一想到练好了他们要派我出国比赛，有名有利，就又心甘情愿了。在那时，我脑子里哪有无产阶级政治和国家大事呀！
    十八岁，我在中学毕业了，黑帮们迫不及待地把我送到国外去“深造”，让我进一步受资产阶级、修正主义的熏染。
    周扬黑帮为了毒害我，大搞物质刺激，说穿了，也就是钞票挂帅。中学时代，除开伙食费外，我每月只有零用金六元。可是一九六二年得奖回国后，在周扬的指示下，夏衍要我住民族饭店
  （我不愿去），后来又发给我每天五元的生活费，要我去吃高级饭馆。到上海、广州演出，都叫我住最高级的饭店，还要我去疗养。两次给我上千元的唱片税。一个学生，从一个月六元到一天五元、到上千元的收入，头脑一定要起变化，资产阶级、修正主义思想一定要滋长。
    在艺术思想上，我受毒更深。周扬借什么“一切外国艺术，只要是好的都要学到手”为名，要我大演外国曲目，明目张胆地反对毛主席文艺路线。
    几年来，我学习、演出、比赛的曲目，百分之九十九是大、洋、古的，是宣扬资产阶级的什么死、梦、爱情的。仅有的一点中国作品，象《鱼美人》等，也都是修正主义的变种。
    一九六四年，文化革命形势逼人，可是周扬这个“祖师爷”，耍出各种花招，要我坚守大、洋、古阵地。
    林默涵等一伙说：“大、洋、古你们要首先搞好，以后再批判”，“搞大、洋、古是翻译工作，要多搞”。
    一九六四和一九六五年，我参加了农村社会主义教育运动，通过与贫下中农“三同”，提高了阶级觉悟，有了一点为工农兵服务的要求，创作了《农村新歌》等小品。黑帮们就暴跳如雷，说我不务正业，百般刁难。
    一九六四年初，在音乐舞蹈会议期间，贺绿汀把我叫到民族饭店，问我最近在干什么。我说：“探讨钢琴三化问题，搞创作。”他却大加指责说：“你别和人乱搞什么大跃进、革命化的作品，这都是大齐奏，简单化！你还是练你的琴（指大、洋、古）吧！”
    林默涵听了我的演奏后说：“你别总弹那些紧张的，要多弹些抒情的东西。”
    周扬，你这个黑帮头子在后台大耍指挥棒，让你的爪牙、走狗的黑手伸向全国各地。你指使着你的追随者林默涵、夏衍、贺绿汀等在我身上大搞“和平演变”。今天是和你清算的时候了，我要控诉你们的反党罪行。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”
    无产阶级和资产阶级争夺下一代的斗争，是整个社会主义时代阶级斗争的一个重要组成部分。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切从人民的利益出发”，要求我们到大风大浪里去锻炼成长。
    可是，你们却从你们反党集团的利益出发，不管亿万中国人民的死活，拿人民的钱大肆挥霍，来培养你们的接班人，让我充当你们搞资本主义复辟的工具。十几年来，你们无时无刻不与我们党争夺青年一代。
    今天，毛主席把我从修正主义泥坑里救了出来，毛主席的思想照亮了我的心，使我觉悟了过来，我看透了你们这帮反党分子的黑心。
    我要紧紧握住毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器，和广大工农兵群众一起，把周扬这个文艺黑帮头子，揪出来斗臭、斗倒。一定要把你们那个“阎王殿”彻底砸烂，把你们在全国各个角落、在我们乐团、在我身上放的毒，坚决彻底清除干净！
