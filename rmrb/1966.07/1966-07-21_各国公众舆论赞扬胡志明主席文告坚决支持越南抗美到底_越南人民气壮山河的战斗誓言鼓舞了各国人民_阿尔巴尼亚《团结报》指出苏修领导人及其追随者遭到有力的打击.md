After the publication of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots," it has had a wide impact around the world. Public opinion in various countries has expressed support for the just position taken by Chairman Ho Chi Minh and firmly supports the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialist aggression.

The editorial department of Albania's "Unity" newspaper published an article on the 19th stating that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots," Chairman Ho Chi Minh's order to mobilize a portion of the reserve forces, and the decisions of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as the preparations made by the Vietnamese people to respond to these important measures, demonstrate the great determination of the entire Vietnamese people to defend their country, defeat the invaders, and fight to the final victory. This is a great example for all revolutionary peoples and a great encouragement and lesson for all peoples still under foreign rule.

The article points out that the firm and heroic stance of the Vietnamese people has dealt a powerful blow to the Soviet revisionist leaders and all their followers. These traitors, wearing false masks, attempt to deceive the Vietnamese people and make them accept American slavery. Just as they surrendered to American imperialism during the Caribbean crisis, now they want the Vietnamese people to surrender to American blackmail. However, the Vietnamese people, with their long and rich experience in the struggle for freedom, have not been intimidated by the invaders. The Vietnamese people are determined to sacrifice everything rather than kneel and beg for life like the Soviet revisionist traitors.

The article states that the Albanian people, who have always supported the heroic Vietnamese people, wholeheartedly cheer for the measures and decisions taken by Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and once again express their full support for the heroic Vietnamese people.

On the 19th, the Pathet Lao radio station in Laos broadcasted a commentary stating that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call will surely promote the national anti-American and patriotic movement in Vietnam.

The commentary expressed, "The people of Laos, Vietnam's neighboring country, have had a common enemy with the Vietnamese people in the past—French colonialists—and now also have a common enemy with the Vietnamese people—American imperialism. The Lao people will always stand on the side of the Vietnamese people, always supporting and helping each other."

On the 18th, the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted a commentary stating that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" is "the resolute vow of the 31 million heroic Vietnamese people to defeat American imperialist invaders." The commentary said, "The Thai people unreservedly support the fighting resolve of the heroic Vietnamese brothers."

The commentary exposed that while American imperialism is escalating its aggression against Vietnam by bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, its accomplices, the Soviet revisionist leadership, British Prime Minister Wilson, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru, are all acting in concert to serve American imperialism's "peace talks" deception. The commentary pointed out, "Moscow has become the active center for promoting the 'peace talks' deception and selling out the national interests of Vietnam to American imperialism."

The commentary said, "American imperialism is the common vicious enemy of the people of Vietnam and Thailand. The victory of the Vietnamese people in resisting American invaders is our victory. Therefore, we must closely unite with our Vietnamese brothers to defeat the American invaders and their lackeys. We must, together with all the just people of the world, wholeheartedly support the struggle of the Vietnamese people until we drive American imperialism out of Vietnam."

On the 17th, the Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement saying: The United States, through bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, has pushed its aggression in Vietnam to a new stage. At this time, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement calling for a resolute struggle to the end, which is entirely justified.

The statement pointed out that the "peace talks" advocated by the United States are a means of deceiving world public opinion. Only on the basis of the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam can there be a possibility of peace in Vietnam. The United States must immediately withdraw its troops from South Vietnam.

On the 19th, the Algerian News Agency published a commentary stating that as long as American troops do not withdraw from Vietnamese territory, it is impossible to consider reconvening the Geneva Conference to resolve the Vietnamese issue, especially since the United States invaded the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and bombed Hanoi and Haiphong.

The commentary emphasized that all actions of the United States in Vietnam are in violation of the Geneva Agreement. The American imperialists have trampled on the Geneva Agreement and violated international law. The commentary pointed out that the Vietnamese people are determined to make every sacrifice to win victory.

    各国公众舆论赞扬胡志明主席文告坚决支持越南抗美到底
    越南人民气壮山河的战斗誓言鼓舞了各国人民
    阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》指出苏修领导人及其追随者遭到有力的打击
    据新华社讯　胡志明主席《告全国同胞书》发表以后，在全世界引起广泛的影响。各国公众舆论纷纷表示支持胡志明主席所表明的正义立场，并坚决支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的英勇斗争。
    阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十九日发表编辑部文章说，胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》、胡志明主席关于动员一部分后备兵员的命令，和越南民主共和国国会的决定以及越南人民为响应这些重要措施而进行的准备，表现了全体越南人民保卫祖国、打败侵略者和把斗争进行到最后胜利的伟大决心。这是所有革命人民的一个伟大的榜样，也是对一切仍然处在外国统治下的人民的一个巨大的鼓舞和教导。
    文章指出，越南人民的坚定和英勇的立场有力地打了苏联修正主义领导人和所有追随者一个耳光。这些叛徒戴着假面具，企图欺骗越南人民，要越南人民接受美国的奴役。同他们在加勒比海危机期间投降美帝国主义一样，现在他们又要越南人民在美国的讹诈面前投降。但是有着争取自由斗争的长期丰富经验的越南人民，并没有被侵略者吓倒。越南人民决心宁愿牺牲，也决不象苏联修正主义叛徒一样屈膝求生。
    文章说，一贯支持英雄的越南人民的阿尔巴尼亚人民衷心欢呼胡志明主席和越南民主共和国国会采取的措施和决定，并再次表示完全支持英雄的越南人民。
    老挝巴特寮电台十九日发表评论说，胡志明主席的这一号召必将促进越南全国的抗美救国运动。
    评论表示，“越南人民的邻邦老挝人民，过去同越南人民有着共同的敌人法国殖民者，现在也同越南人民有着共同的敌人美帝国主义。老挝人民永远站在越南人民一边，永远互相支持，互相帮助。”
    “泰国人民之声”电台十八日发表评论说，胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》是“决心战胜美帝国主义侵略者的英雄的三千一百万越南人民气壮山河的誓言”，“泰国人民毫无保留地支持英雄的越南人民兄弟的战斗决心”。
    评论揭露说，正当美帝国主义加紧把侵略越南的战争“升级”、轰炸河内海防的时候，它的帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团、英国首相威尔逊和印度总理甘地夫人纷纷出动，串通一气，为美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局效劳。评论指出，“莫斯科已成为推行‘和谈’骗局、把越南民族利益出卖给美帝国主义的活动中心”。
    评论说：“美帝国主义是越南和泰国两国人民共同的凶恶敌人。越南人民抗击美国侵略者的胜利就是我们的胜利。因此，我们要和越南兄弟紧密团结，打败美国侵略者及其走狗。我们要和全世界各国正义的人们一道，全心全意地支持越南人民的斗争，直到把美帝国主义赶出越南为止。”
    日本社会党十七日发表声明说：美国通过轰炸河内、海防，把它在越南进行的侵略战争推向了新的阶段。在这时候，越南民主共和国发表声明，呼吁坚决抗战到底，这是理所当然的。
    声明指出，美国鼓吹的“和谈”是欺骗世界舆论的手段。只有在越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明的基础上，才有可能实现越南的和平。美国必须立刻从越南南方撤走它的军队。
    阿尔及利亚新闻社十九日发表评论说，美军一天不撤出越南领土，就不能考虑重新召开日内瓦会议来解决越南问题，特别是自从美国侵略越南民主共和国和轰炸河内、海防以来更应该如此。
    评论强调指出：美国在越南的一切行动都是违背日内瓦协议的。美帝国主义者践踏了日内瓦协议，破坏了国际法。评论指出，越南人民决心作出一切牺牲以赢得胜利。
