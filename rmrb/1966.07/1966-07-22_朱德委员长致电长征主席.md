Chairman Zhu De Cables Long Cheng

The Chinese people firmly support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against the Americans to the end

The U.S. imperialists' policy of expanding the war of aggression and playing the "peace talks" trick has been met with heavy blows from the Vietnamese people

The heroic Vietnamese people are not intimidated and cannot be deceived. The U.S. aggressors cannot escape their inevitable defeat

New China News Agency, July 22 -- Chairman Zhu De sent a telegram to Chairman Long Cheng of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	To Comrade Long Cheng, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi:

	The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the 700 million Chinese people, firmly supports Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots," Chairman Ho Chi Minh's order to mobilize part of the reserve forces, the decision of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to mobilize part of the reserve forces, and the communiqué of the Supreme National Defense Council of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. These four documents express the just demands of the 31 million Vietnamese people and reflect the Vietnamese people's resolute determination to fight to the end. The Chinese people express their boundless admiration and highest respect for the iron will of the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle against the Americans to save their country.

	The U.S. imperialists' war of aggression against Vietnam has proven that U.S. imperialism is more barbaric and more fragile than Hitler fascism. It is already surrounded by the people of the world. The Vietnamese people have already beaten it to the point of desperation, pushing it to the brink of ruin. The U.S. imperialists' continuous increase of troops in Vietnam and their relentless bombing of the capital city of Hanoi and the port city of Haiphong, pushing the war of aggression to a new and more serious stage, are signs of their desperate struggle.

	The U.S. imperialists' policy of expanding the war of aggression and playing the "peace talks" trick has already been met with heavy blows from the Vietnamese people. The heroic Vietnamese people are not intimidated and cannot be deceived. The U.S. aggressors cannot escape their inevitable defeat.

	Vietnam and China are brothers and neighbors who depend on each other. The Chinese people have always, unconditionally, and from all aspects supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against the Americans to save their country. The Chinese government has solemnly declared that we will, according to the interests of the Vietnamese people and the requirements of the Vietnamese people, take whatever actions we deem necessary at any time and in any place. No matter where the U.S. aggressors want to expand the war, no matter what the cost, we will firmly and unshakably support and aid the Vietnamese people in their struggle to the end, until the Vietnamese people achieve final victory.

	Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, Zhu De

	Beijing, July 22, 1966

    朱德委员长致电长征主席
    中国人民坚定不移地支援越南人民抗美到底
    美帝扩大侵略战争和玩弄“和谈”骗局的反革命两手政策，已遭到越南人民的沉重打击
    英雄的越南人民是吓不倒的，也是骗不了的。美国侵略者无法逃避它必然失败的命运
    新华社二十二日讯　朱德委员长今天打电报给越南民主共和国国会常务委员会主席长征，电报全文如下：河　内越南民主共和国国会常务委员会主席长征同志：
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会以七亿中国人民的名义，坚决支持胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》、胡志明主席关于动员一部分后备兵员的命令、越南民主共和国国会常务委员会关于动员一部分后备兵员的决定和越南民主共和国最高国防会议的公报。这四个文件，表达了三千一百万越南人民的正义呼声，反映了越南人民抗战到底的坚强决心。中国人民对于英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志，表示无限的钦佩和崇高的敬意。
    美国侵略越南的战争证明，美帝国主义比当年希特勒法西斯更加野蛮，也更加脆弱。它已经处在全世界人民的重重包围之中。越南人民已经把它打得焦头烂额，使它陷于绝境。美帝国主义在越南不断增兵，悍然连续轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市和海防市，把侵略战争推到一个新的更严重的阶段，正是它垂死挣扎的表现。
    美帝国主义扩大侵略战争和玩弄“和谈”骗局的反革命两手政策，已经遭到越南人民的沉重打击。英雄的越南人民是吓不倒的，也是骗不了的。美国侵略者无法逃避它必然失败的命运。
    越南和中国是唇齿相依的兄弟邻邦。中国人民一贯地、无保留地从各个方面支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争。中国政府已经郑重声明，我们将根据越南人民的利益，根据越南人民的要求，随时随地采取我们认为必要的行动。不管美国侵略者要把战争扩大到什么地方，不管要付出多大的代价，我们都将坚定不移地支持和援助越南人民打到底，直到越南人民取得最后胜利。
    	                 中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会
                         常务委员会委员长   朱德
                         一九六六年七月二十二日于北京
