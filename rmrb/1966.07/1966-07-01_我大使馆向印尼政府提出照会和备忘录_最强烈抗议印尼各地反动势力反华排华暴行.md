The Chinese Embassy to Indonesia submitted a note verbale to the Indonesian government on June 27, strongly protesting the anti-Chinese and discriminatory violence in the Aceh region of North Sumatra and demanding immediate measures to stop the persecution and expulsion of Chinese residents, compensate for the losses, and ensure their safety.

The note verbale pointed out: "The reactionary forces in Aceh are escalating their racist violence against Chinese people. They have been arbitrarily summoning, arresting, kidnapping, and even beating leaders of Chinese organizations, harassing, destroying, and looting Chinese shops and residences, creating fascist terror, and forcibly expelling Chinese residents. These despicable actions have sparked a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment, seriously threatening the lives of Chinese residents who have been lawfully residing and maintaining friendly relations with the local people, and subjecting them to unbearable mental torment. These series of atrocities were carried out under the direct orders of the First Military District Commander, with the collaboration of local military and government officials and reactionary thugs."

The note verbale listed several serious incidents of anti-Chinese and discriminatory violence in various cities in Aceh.

The note verbale pointed out that in early May, the Commander of the First Military District of Indonesia, Suharto, arrived in Lhokseumawe and ordered local officials to intensify anti-Chinese and discriminatory actions. On May 7, the board members of the Lhokseumawe Chinese Association and teachers from the Chinese school were taken to the military police station for illegal and unreasonable interrogation. Before releasing them, local officials formally demanded that all Chinese residents leave Lhokseumawe by July of this year.

In late May, thugs in Lhokseumawe set up an illegal court, summoning Chinese residents for various threats, telling them: "If you do not leave by the end of June, be careful (they will tie you up, chop you into pieces, and ship you to China in a wooden box)!"

On June 7, thugs kidnapped Zhang Zancheng, the 60-year-old chairman of the Lhokseumawe Chinese Association, binding his hands and pushing him into a car. Zhang jumped out of the car several times in anger, but was bound again and forcibly taken away. He was tortured by the thugs for several days before being released.

On May 8, the First Military District Commander announced in Kuala Nongsa that Chinese residents must leave Aceh by August 17. In Kuala Nongsa and Yogyakarta, incidents occurred where board members of the Chinese Association were detained, and thugs searched and looted Chinese shops and residences.

This year, Chinese residents in the northern districts of Aceh, such as Simeulue, Meranti, and Lhokseumawe, who suffered savage racial persecution in April, are in increasingly dangerous situations and have been ordered to leave by August 17.

The note verbale pointed out: On May 5, Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio publicly stated in the parliament: "The Indonesian government has not expelled Chinese residents." Now, the Commander of the First Military District of Indonesia not only calls for the expulsion of Chinese residents within his jurisdiction but also forces them to leave within a specified time. This exposes an attempt by the Indonesian government to cover up the truth.

The Chinese Embassy to Indonesia submitted a memorandum to the Indonesian government on June 27, strongly protesting the two incidents in which Indonesian thugs brutally killed Chinese residents in Jember, East Java, in May. The memorandum demands that the Indonesian government immediately arrest and punish the perpetrators and their instigators, compensate the families of the victims, and take effective measures to protect the lives and property of Chinese residents, ensuring that such incidents do not happen again.

The memorandum pointed out that on May 20, Li Zhenlin, a Chinese resident in Jember, was staying in a drying room attached to the Asia Rubber Factory on the outskirts of the city. Three thugs armed with iron rods beat Li Zhenlin to death on the spot. Li Zhenlin left behind a pregnant wife and seven young children, whose lives are now in dire straits. On May 27, Zheng Dongjun, another Chinese resident, was riding his bicycle home when he was suddenly attacked by four thugs and killed on the spot. They had always engaged in legitimate occupations, were law-abiding, kind to others, and maintained friendly relations with the local people.

The memorandum pointed out: "The above two incidents in Jember are not isolated or accidental. Since last October, right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia have organized thugs to brutally persecute innocent Chinese residents, arbitrarily detaining them, setting up illegal courts, beating and humiliating them, and even cruelly killing them. So far, hundreds of Chinese residents have been killed. The embassy has repeatedly protested and negotiated with the Indonesian Foreign Ministry on this issue, but the Indonesian government has yet to respond or explain."

The memorandum stated: "Protecting the lives and property of foreign residents is an internationally recognized principle of diplomatic relations. Moreover, according to the relevant treaties and agreements signed by the two governments regarding the issue of residents, the Indonesian government has the inescapable responsibility to protect the legitimate rights of Chinese residents. However, the facts show that the Indonesian government not only fails to fulfill these obligations but also colludes with, shields, and encourages right-wing thugs to persecute Chinese residents. To cater to the needs of imperialism, it has spared no effort to stir up a racist anti-Chinese wave; this is the real background behind the brutal killings of Chinese residents Li Zhenlin and Zheng Dongjun in Jember."

"The above two incidents occurred more than a month ago, but the relevant authorities have allowed the murderers to roam freely, neither solving the case nor arresting the culprits, and have given no explanation or arrangement for the families of the victims. They have truly reached a shocking level of disregard for the lives of Chinese residents."

    我大使馆向印尼政府提出照会和备忘录
    最强烈抗议印尼各地反动势力反华排华暴行
    新华社三十日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆二十七日照会印度尼西亚政府，就北苏门答腊亚齐地区的反华排华暴行提出最强烈抗议，并且要求立即采取措施，停止在亚齐地区和印度尼西亚全国各地迫害和驱逐华侨的行径，赔偿华侨损失，保障华侨安全。
    照会指出：“亚齐各地反动势力反华、排华的种族主义暴行，仍在愈演愈烈。他们通过无理传讯、逮捕、绑架甚至殴打华侨团体负责人，骚扰、破坏、抢劫华侨商店和住宅，制造法西斯恐怖，以及驱逐华侨限期离境等卑劣作法，已经掀起了一股反华排华狂潮，使得一向合法居留并同当地人民友好相处的华侨，生活上受到严重威胁，精神遭到种种难以忍受的折磨。这一系列的暴行，是在第一军区司令的直接指使下，由各地军政当局伙同反动暴徒一手干出来的。”
    照会列举了亚齐地区一些城市内反华、排华的许多严重事实。
    照会指出，五月初，印度尼西亚第一军区司令儒阿尔萨来到冷沙，勒令当地官员加紧策划反华、排华，五月七日，冷沙中华总会理事和中华学校教师被押到宪兵部拘留和非法、无理地审讯。当地官员在释放他们以前正式提出，要全体华侨今年七月份以前离开冷沙。
    五月下旬，冷沙暴徒私设刑庭，非法传讯华侨，进行种种恫吓，威胁他们说：如果到六月底不离境，“当心（把你们）捆绑手脚，剁成肉块，装入木箱运往中国！”
    六月七日，暴徒绑架六十高龄的冷沙中华总会主席张赞成老先生，捆绑他的双手，推上汽车，张老先生一再愤怒地跳下车，又被暴徒捆了双脚，强迫载走，被暴徒折磨了几天才放出。
    五月八日，第一军区司令又在瓜拉新邦宣布限华侨八月十七日前离开亚齐。在瓜拉新邦和怡里，都发生了中华总会理事被拘押和暴徒搜查、抢劫华侨商店、住宅的事件。
    今年四月份遭受种族主义野蛮迫害的北亚齐县的司马委、美伦、鹿树昆等地的华侨，处境越来越险恶，并先后被通知于今年八月十七日以前离境。
    照会指出：印度尼西亚外交部长马利克五月五日曾在国会公开宣称：印度尼西亚政府没有驱逐华侨。现在印度尼西亚第一军区司令不仅叫嚷要驱逐其辖区内的华侨，而且强迫华侨限期离境。这戳穿了印度尼西亚政府力图掩饰的一个阴谋。
    新华社三十日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆二十七日向印度尼西亚政府提交一项备忘录，就今年五月在东爪哇惹班连续发生两起印度尼西亚暴徒惨杀华侨的事件提出最严重的抗议。备忘录要求印度尼西亚政府立即逮捕和惩办凶手及其主使者，抚恤被害者家属，同时切实采取措施，保护华侨生命财产的安全，保证不再发生类似事件。
    备忘录指出，五月二十日居住在惹班的华侨李振麟在亚细亚碾胶厂附设于郊外的烘胶房寄宿时，有三名暴徒携带铁器，将李振麟当场击死。李振麟留下正在怀孕的妻子和年幼儿女七人，生活濒于绝境。华侨郑东君五月二十七日乘自行车返家途中，突遭四名暴徒袭击，当场毙命。他们一向从事正当职业，为人安分守己，待人和善，同当地人民保持着友好关系。
    备忘录指出：“上述两起在惹班发生的惨案，绝不是孤立和偶然的事件。去年十月以来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力到处组织暴徒对无辜的华侨进行野蛮迫害，对他们任意拘留，私设刑庭，殴打侮辱，以至残酷杀害。到目前为止，遭到杀害的华侨已达数百人。（中国）大使馆曾就此多次向印度尼西亚外交部提出严正抗议和交涉，但印度尼西亚政府迄今未作出任何答复和交代。”
    备忘录说：“保护外国侨民生命财产的安全，是公认的国际关系准则，何况根据两国政府就侨民问题所签订的有关条约和协议，印度尼西亚政府负有保护华侨正当权益的不可推卸的责任。而大量的事实表明：印度尼西亚政府不仅不履行这些义务，反而听任、包庇和纵容右派暴徒对华侨的疯狂迫害，并且为了投合帝国主义的需要，不遗余力地掀起种族主义的排华浪潮；而这就是上述惹班华侨李振麟和郑东君惨遭杀害的真实背景。
    “上述两起惨案接连发生，时间已过去一个多月，有关当局听任杀人凶手逍遥自在，既不破案，又不缉凶，对死者家属也无任何交代和安置。他们玩忽华侨人命，真是达到令人发指的地步。”
