The Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers has successively received congratulatory telegrams from organizations in various countries and international bodies. The telegrams warmly congratulate the conference for its active contributions in supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, and in mobilizing the Asian and African peoples to unite in the struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and Soviet revisionism led by the United States.

The Albanian Writers' Union's telegram states, "We, Albanian writers, fully support your conference. This is a resolute conference against American imperialism and splitters, a struggle of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and Soviet revisionism."

The Malaya People's Asian-African Solidarity Committee's message to the conference says, "Asian and African writers have a responsibility to the anti-imperialist Asian and African peoples, especially to the Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting against American imperialist aggression at present. Unified support for Vietnam is closely linked with the anti-imperialist national liberation struggles of the Asian and African countries. Apart from providing material aid as much as possible, the peoples of the Asian and African countries must wage the struggle against imperialism led by American imperialism in their own countries to give the greatest support to the Vietnamese people."

The message states, "The praise and support for the heroic spirit and achievements of the Vietnamese people expressed by those who do not take concrete actions in the struggle against the imperialist enemy are merely empty words. In reality, they are covering up the betrayal of the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the world's people against imperialism led by the United States. Especially in this regard, Asian and African writers will denounce the modern revisionists led by the current Soviet leadership, who make grand statements attempting to make the world's people believe that they support the struggle of the Vietnamese people. However, all their actions are aimed at 'controlling' the situation in Vietnam to save the failure of American imperialists in Vietnam."

Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman Ahmad Shukeiri, in his telegram, expresses unconditional support for the conference's resolutions on behalf of the Palestinian people. He says in the telegram, "We support the firm stance of the Vietnamese liberation movement against American imperialism. We look forward to the Vietnamese people achieving victory in their heroic struggle to liberate their country from American aggression." Shukeiri also expresses gratitude in the telegram to the great Chinese people and government for their aid to the Palestinian people who are engaged in the sacred struggle to liberate their homeland from Israeli aggression.

The secretary-general of the Pakistan Writers' Union sent a telegram saying, "We assure you that in our common struggle against imperialism—we have recently been invaded by one of the imperialist agents—we are completely in agreement with you."

The telegram from the External Affairs Committee of the South West Africa People's Organization states: "The Vietnamese people are winning one battle after another, and the Johnson fascist government is sinking day by day in the vast sea of people's war, already surrounded by the people of the world."

The telegram condemns the accomplices of American imperialism, their lackeys, who are shamelessly plotting to sabotage this conference, obstruct the conference's achievements. Their so-called "extraordinary" conference is not only an illegal act but also a subversive plot to sabotage Asian-African solidarity and serve American imperialism.

The Central Committee of the Thai Patriotic Front and the Thai Asian-African Solidarity Committee, in their telegram, express full support for the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers on behalf of the patriotic people of Thailand. The telegram states, "At this moment when American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam is becoming increasingly frenzied, the holding of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers 'has even greater significance for the struggle of the Vietnamese people, for the struggle of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by American imperialism.' The telegram expresses the belief that 'Asian and African writers, united as one, can resist, break through, and defeat the cultural aggression of American imperialism and old and new colonialism, and can develop and promote the revolutionary excellent culture of the two continents' people."

The telegram points out: The Soviet modern revisionists, in collusion with certain people, held a split conference of Asian and African writers in Cairo, and at the same time, made illegal decisions, "which is a shameless act, opposing the struggle of the Vietnamese people, opposing the struggle of the Asian and African peoples. Such behavior can only be beneficial to imperialism and old and new colonialism led by American imperialism, and not beneficial to the peoples who are struggling against their aggression. We, on behalf of the patriotic people of Thailand, strongly condemn and resolutely oppose the aforementioned Cairo split conference."

The telegram from Kashmiri writers states, "For the past sixteen years, Kashmir State, which has been subjected to unbridled aggression and forcibly occupied by India, congratulates the Asian and African Writers' Conference held in Beijing. We fervently hope that our Asian and African brothers will give full support to the struggle of the people of Jammu and Kashmir to liberate themselves from the shackles of India and to struggle for freedom and a just life based on their inherent rights."

The Executive Committee Secretariat of the Asian and African Lawyers' Conference, in its telegram, expresses full support for the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. The telegram states, "We will fight together with Asian and African writers and the Asian and African peoples against our common enemy, imperialism and its lackeys. This conference will make significant contributions to strengthening the united anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples, inspiring the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, and mobilizing the Asian and African peoples and the peoples of the world to support the heroic Vietnamese people more broadly and powerfully."

    一些国家的团体和国际组织热烈祝贺亚非作家紧急会议
    亚非人民团结起来在反帝反修斗争中作出贡献
    苏修召开分裂会议是破坏亚非团结为美帝效劳的颠覆阴谋
    新华社八日讯　亚非作家紧急会议陆续收到一些国家的团体以及国际组织的贺电。来电热烈祝贺大会在支援越南人民抗美救国斗争，在动员亚非人民团结起来反对以美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义和苏联现代修正主义的斗争中作出积极贡献。
    阿尔巴尼亚作家协会的贺电说，“我们阿尔巴尼亚作家完全支持你们的会议。这是一个坚决反对美帝国主义及分裂者的会议，是亚非人民反对帝国主义和苏联修正主义的一场斗争。”
    马来亚人民亚非团结委员会致大会的贺词说，“亚非作家对反帝的亚非人民，特别是对目前在为反对美帝国主义侵略而进行英勇斗争的越南人民负有责任。对越南的一致援助是与亚非各国的反帝民族解放斗争紧密相连的。除尽可能在物质上给予援助外，亚非国家的人民在他们自己的国家中开展反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的斗争才能给越南人民以最大的支持。”
    贺词说，“那些在反对帝国主义敌人的斗争中不采取具体行动的人所说的赞扬和支持越南人民的英雄气概和成就的辞句只不过是空话，实际上是对越南人民和世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争的背叛打掩护。特别是在这一点上，亚非作家将谴责以苏联现领导为首的现代修正主义者，他们大放厥词，企图使世界人民认为他们是支持越南人民的斗争的。但是他们的每一行动都是为了实现对越南形势的‘控制’以挽救美帝国主义者在越南的失败。”
    巴勒斯坦解放组织主席艾哈迈德·舒凯里在贺电中以巴勒斯坦人民的名义，表示无保留地支持会议的决议。他在贺电中说，“我们支持越南解放运动的反对美帝国主义的坚定立场。我们期待着越南人民在进行把祖国从美国侵略下解放出来的英勇斗争中取得胜利。”舒凯里在贺电中还表示感谢伟大的中国人民和政府对正在进行从以色列的侵犯下解放家园的神圣运动的巴勒斯坦人民的援助。
    巴基斯坦作家协会秘书长发来的贺电说，“我们向你们保证，在我们反对帝国主义的共同斗争中——最近我们还受到帝国主义的代理人之一的侵略——，我们同你们是完全一致的。”
    西南非民族联盟对外委员会的贺电说：“越南人民正在赢得一个接着一个的战斗，约翰逊法西斯政府正一天一天的沉没在人民战争的汪洋大海中，它已受到全世界人民的包围。”
    贺电谴责美帝国主义的同谋者、他们的走卒，正在肆无忌惮地进行阴谋活动，企图破坏这次会议，阻止会议取得成就。他们策划的所谓“非常”会议，不仅是一种非法行动，而且是一个破坏亚非团结并为美帝国主义效劳的颠覆阴谋。
    泰国爱国阵线中央委员会和泰国亚非团结委员会在贺电中以泰国爱国人民的名义，对亚非作家紧急会议表示完全的支持。电报说，当此美帝国主义对越南的侵略越来越疯狂的时刻，亚非作家紧急会议的举行，“对于越南人民的斗争，对于亚非人民反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，具有更加重大的意义。”贺电表示深信，“亚非作家团结一致，就能够抗御、击破和战胜美帝国主义和新老殖民主义的文化侵略，能够发展和发扬两大洲人民的革命的优秀文化。”
    电报指出：苏联现代修正主义者和某些人相勾结，在开罗召开了亚非作家分裂会议，同时，悍然做出非法的决定，“乃是无耻的行为，是反对越南人民的斗争，反对亚非人民的斗争的。这种行为只能是有利于以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，而不利于反对它们的侵略的人民。我们以泰国爱国人民的名义，强烈谴责和坚决反对上述的开罗分裂会议。”
    克什米尔作家的贺电说，“在过去十六年中一直遭受印度肆无忌惮的侵略和被印度强行霸占的克什米尔邦的作家，向在北京召开的亚非作家会议表示祝贺。我们热烈希望我们的亚非兄弟将对查谟和克什米尔人民为争取从印度的枷锁下解放出来，并根据他们固有的权利为争取自由、正当的生活而进行的斗争给予完全的支持。”
    亚非法律工作者会议执行委员会常设书记处在贺电中对亚非作家紧急会议表示完全支持。贺电说，“我们将同亚非作家、亚非人民一道为反对共同的敌人帝国主义及其帮凶而共同斗争。这次大会将对加强亚非人民团结反帝革命事业，鼓舞越南人民的抗美救国斗争，动员亚非人民和世界人民更广泛、更强有力地支持英勇的越南人民作出重大贡献。”
