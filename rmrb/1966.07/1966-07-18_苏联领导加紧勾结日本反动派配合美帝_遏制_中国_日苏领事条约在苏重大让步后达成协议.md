	Soviet Leadership Hurries to Collude with Japanese Reactionaries to Assist U.S. Imperialism in "Containing" China
	Day-Soviet Consular Treaty Reached After Major Soviet Concessions

	New China News Agency Tokyo, July 16 — According to Japanese newspapers, the negotiations for the Day-Soviet consular treaty reached an agreement on all items of the treaty in Moscow on July 14 after the Soviet Union made major concessions.

	This treaty will be formally signed by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shina in Tokyo on July 29.

	Since the negotiations began in Moscow last summer, the Sato government of Japan has put forward harsh conditions on the issue of consular jurisdiction and the issue of Soviet guarantees for the safety of Japanese fishing boats' crew members in waters controlled by the Soviet Union. Because the Soviet leadership is eager to collude with the Sato government of Japan and intends to use the signing of this treaty as a "gift" for Gromyko's visit to Japan, it has repeatedly made concessions and hastily reached an agreement before Gromyko's departure for Japan.

	Regarding the issue of signing a consular treaty between Day and the Soviet Union, it was already proposed in the 1956 Day-Soviet Joint Declaration. Soon after the new Soviet leadership came to power, it actively proposed to Japan to negotiate this treaty. Now, it has repeatedly compromised and made concessions to reach an agreement with Japan, which shows that the new Soviet leadership is eager to further collude with Japanese reactionaries in order to assist U.S. imperialism in implementing its counter-revolutionary strategy of "containing" China.

　　苏联领导加紧勾结日本反动派配合美帝“遏制”中国
　　日苏领事条约在苏重大让步后达成协议
    新华社东京十六日电据日本报纸透露，日苏领事条约谈判，在苏联作出重大让步后，十四日在莫斯科就条约全部内容达成协议。
    这个条约将在二十九日由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯、日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎在东京正式签字。
    自从去年夏天在莫斯科开始谈判以来，日本佐藤政府就领事管辖权问题、苏联保障日本在苏联控制的岛屿外捕鱼船船员的安全问题，提出了苛刻的条件。由于苏联领导集团急迫地与日本佐藤政府勾结，并打算把缔结这一条约作为葛罗米柯访问日本的“礼物”带给日本佐藤政府，因此在葛罗米柯动身访问日本之前，一再让步，匆匆达成了协议。
    关于日苏签订领事条约的问题，早在一九五六年日苏联合宣言中就已经提出。苏联新领导集团上台后不久就主动向日本提议就这一条约进行谈判，现在又一再妥协让步同日本达成协议，这表明苏联新领导迫不及待地进一步勾结日本反动派，以便配合美帝国主义推行“遏制”中国的反革命战略。
