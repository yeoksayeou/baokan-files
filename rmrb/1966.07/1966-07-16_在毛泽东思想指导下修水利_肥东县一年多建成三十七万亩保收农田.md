Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of Feidong County in Anhui Province have undertaken extensive irrigation projects. Over the course of more than a year, they have constructed 370,000 mu of guaranteed-yield farmland. Prior to this, the county had already developed 180,000 mu of guaranteed-yield farmland through irrigation projects.

Last year, the region experienced a severe drought from July to August, a phenomenon unprecedented in history. Despite this, the county's grain production increased by 14% compared to the previous year, thanks to the construction of guaranteed-yield farmland. This year, the county's summer crops have also yielded a good harvest.

Feidong County is located in the Jianghuai hilly region between the Yangtze River and the Huai River. Out of its 1.5 million mu of arable land, 1.2 million mu are distributed across hills and are prone to drought. Historically, Feidong has been one of Anhui's most drought-prone areas.

In the past, some leaders in Feidong County harbored a sense of difficulty and believed that undertaking irrigation projects in a drought-prone region would be challenging. However, last spring, they resolutely followed Chairman Mao's directive to "resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They bravely led the people in the battle against water scarcity.

Now, the county's irrigation landscape has undergone significant changes. Over 500 kilometers of main canals, branch canals, and small canals crisscross the region like a spider's web. Fifty-five million mu of hillside farmland, which was previously susceptible to drought, has now been fully irrigated and transformed into guaranteed-yield farmland.

In previous years, Feidong County had a small area of rice fields. This year, the entire county has planted 50 million mu of rice, with the rice crops thriving. More than half of these rice fields are irrigated using new canals. The community members, seeing the harvest improve year by year, joyfully say: "This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought."

### 在毛泽东思想指导下修水利　肥东县一年多建成三十七万亩保收农田

　　在毛泽东思想指导下修水利
　　肥东县一年多建成三十七万亩保收农田
    据新华社合肥电　安徽省肥东县人民在毛泽东思想指导下兴修水利，一年多时间内建设了三十七万亩保收农田。在这以前，全县由于兴修水利，已有保收农田十八万亩。
    去年，这里七八个月没下透雨，是历史上从未见过的大旱年。由于建设的保收农田比较多，全县的粮食产量还比上年增长了百分之十四。今年，这个县的夏收作物又获得了好收成。
    肥东县位于长江和淮河之间的江淮丘陵地区，一百五十万亩耕地中有一百二十万亩分布在岗岭上。是安徽省历史上有名的易旱地区之一。
    过去，肥东县的部分领导干部，存在有畏难情绪，认为在干旱地区进行水利建设困难很多。去年春天，他们坚决按照毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的指示办事，勇敢地领导人民进行治水斗争。
    现在，这个县的水利面貌大大改观。总长五百多公里的干渠、支渠、斗渠，纵横交错，密如蛛网。岗岭上容易受旱的耕地，已有五十五万亩得到了充分灌溉，成为旱涝保收农田。
    往年肥东县水稻面积很小，今年全县已栽水稻五十万亩，水稻长势喜人，其中一大半是用新灌溉渠的水灌溉的。社员们看到收成一年好似一年，高兴地说：这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
