Albanian Newspaper Denounces Soviet, British, Indian, and South Vietnamese Promotion of New US Imperialist Peace Trick
The Conspiracy of Soviet Revisionists to Betray the Vietnamese People is Doomed to Fail

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Tirana on the 13th, the editorial board of the Albanian newspaper "Unity" published an article on the 13th stating that a new shameless conspiracy against the Vietnamese people is currently being plotted. The instigators and organizers of this conspiracy are the imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leaders.

	The article states that the purpose of this conspiracy is to intimidate the Vietnamese people, attempting to persuade the Vietnamese people to abandon their heroic struggle and accept the so-called "peace talks," thereby legalizing the U.S. imperialists' occupation of South Vietnam and turning South Vietnam into a base for U.S. aggression against the peoples of Asian countries, particularly the People's Republic of China.

	The article states that the savage aerial bombardment of Hanoi and Haiphong by American air pirates marks the beginning of this conspiracy. Subsequently, figures like Johnson, Rusk, and McNamara have hysterically threatened to continue expanding the aggression. On the other hand, the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist leaders and their followers have also disguised themselves, seemingly outraged by the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong. However, everyone knows their true intentions; they were aware of this beforehand, and their statements of support for the Vietnamese people are hypocritical.

	The article states that after the Soviet revisionists issued their insidious statements, the U.S. imperialists' agents Wilson, Indira Gandhi, and Tito and others have emerged. They eagerly play the role of "mediators," attempting to end the so-called "conflict." However, despite being adorned with flowery rhetoric, these proposals are essentially no different from Johnson's so-called "peace talks." This clumsy farce cannot deceive the Vietnamese people, nor can it deceive the genuine friends and supporters of the Vietnamese people, or international public opinion.

	The anti-American wave sweeping the world clearly shows that the conspiracies and tricks of the imperialists and revisionists will inevitably suffer a shameful failure. The threats and bluster of imperialism, as well as the despicable conspiracies of modern revisionists, can only further strengthen the Vietnamese people's confidence in victory.

　　阿尔巴尼亚报纸谴责苏英印南推销美帝和谈新骗局
　　苏修出卖越南人民的阴谋必败
    据新华社地拉那十三日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十三日发表编辑部文章说，目前，又一个反对越南人民的无耻阴谋正在策划中，帝国主义者和苏联修正主义领导人是这一阴谋的主使者和组织者。
    文章说，这一阴谋的目的是吓唬越南人民，企图说服越南人民放弃英勇的 斗争，接受所谓“和谈”，使美帝国主义者占领南越合法化，使南越成为美国反对亚洲各国人民、首先是反对中华人民共和国的侵略基地。
    文章说，美国空中强盗野蛮轰炸河内和海防，是这一阴谋的开始，此后，约翰逊、腊斯克和麦克纳马拉之流又歇斯底里地叫嚣要继续扩大侵略。另一方面，苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导人及其追随者也乔妆打扮，似乎他们对美国轰炸河内和海防很愤怒，但是观点大家都很清楚，他们事先是知道这件事的，他们支持越南人民的声明是虚伪的。
    文章说，在苏联修正主义发表别有用心的声明以后，美帝国主义的代理人威尔逊、英迪拉·甘地夫人和铁托之流纷纷出笼。他们起劲地扮演“调停者”的角色，企图结束所谓的“冲突”。但是这类建议尽管用花言巧语加以粉饰，但是在实质上同约翰逊的所谓“和谈”根本没有什么两样。这种拙劣的丑剧骗不了越南人民，也骗不了越南人民真诚的朋友和支持者以及国际公众舆论。
    席卷全世界的反美浪潮清楚地表明，帝国主义者和修正主义者的阴谋诡计必将遭到可耻的破产。帝国主义的威胁和叫嚣以及现代修正主义者的卑鄙阴谋只能进一步加强越南人民必胜的信心。
