Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's Press Department Memorandum Exposes the Heinous Crimes of U.S. Bombing of the North
Firmly Take All Necessary Actions to Defeat the U.S.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 23rd: On July 22nd, the Press Department of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a memorandum on the U.S.'s new escalation of the war against Vietnam. The memorandum exposes the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism from the resumption of its savage bombing of Vietnam on January 31st to July 15th.

The memorandum sternly warns the U.S. aggressors that all their war escalation actions will be defeated, and all their evil deeds will be punished. Those who help the U.S. expand its aggression against Vietnam will also be punished. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will resolutely take all necessary actions to smash any new evil plots of the U.S. government, defend the independence and sovereignty of the motherland, and contribute to the maintenance of world peace.

The memorandum states that on January 31st, 1966, U.S. aircraft blatantly resumed bombing Vietnam, marking the beginning of a new series of evil steps to gradually escalate the war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Since then, the air raids have intensified. On June 24th, 1966, the Associated Press admitted that the number of U.S. air raids was between 200% and 300% of the number before the "bombing halt," with 9,000 to 11,000 sorties per month.

The number of bombs dropped by U.S. aircraft has also increased significantly. U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara admitted that in March 1966 alone, 50,000 tons of bombs were dropped on both North and South Vietnam, which is nearly three times the average monthly bombing during the Korean War. He also said that the U.S. plans to drop 63,800 tons of bombs on Vietnam in 1966, "which is 91% of the bombing during the 37 months of the Korean War."

The memorandum states that the range of U.S. air strikes has also expanded. In late June 1966, a new phase of the U.S. aggression against Vietnam began, with U.S. aircraft conducting multiple raids on Hanoi and Haiphong, indiscriminately bombing residential areas and economic facilities.

The memorandum points out that the U.S. ruling clique has been propagating that they only target "military objectives." The fact is that U.S. aircraft continue to deliberately bomb large and small cities, residential areas, schools, hospitals, dams, dikes, state farms, forests, and factories, destroying public utilities and massacring civilians.

Since February 1966, U.S. aircraft have savagely attacked Haiphong, Nam Dinh, Thanh Hoa, Vinh, Hanoi, and twelve provincial capitals and more than twenty county towns in North Vietnam.

The water conservancy projects in twelve provinces of North Vietnam, including dams, sluices, irrigation canals, and reservoirs, have been constant targets of U.S. air raids. Since February 1966, there have been more than 700 large and small air raids on water conservancy projects, of which 65 targeted the dike system.

The memorandum points out that the U.S. ruling clique's so-called "precise" strikes on "oil depots" and "selected targets" are precisely deliberate air raids on residential areas and public utilities. No amount of deceitful talk can help the U.S. aggressors cover up their heinous crimes in the eyes of public opinion and history.

The U.S. war mongers are shouting about escalating the war in North Vietnam, continuing air raids on Hanoi, and bombing and blockading Haiphong.

The memorandum concludes by saying that the U.S. government must stop its aggression, acknowledge the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, unconditionally and completely stop all air raids and other war actions against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, withdraw all U.S. and its puppet troops and weapons from South Vietnam, and let the Vietnamese people solve their own affairs. As long as U.S. imperialism continues its aggression against Vietnam, the Vietnamese people will resolutely fight to the final victory, even if it takes ten years, twenty years, or even longer.

    越南外交部新闻司备忘录揭露美帝轰炸北方的滔天罪行
    坚决采取一切必要行动打败美帝
    据新华社河内二十三日电　越南民主共和国外交部新闻司二十二日发表关于美国对越南北方新的战争“升级”的罪恶步骤的备忘录，揭露美帝国主义从今年一月三十一日恢复对越南北方的疯狂轰炸到七月十五日期间所犯下的滔天罪行。
    备忘录严厉警告美国侵略者说，他们的一切战争“升级”行动必将遭到挫败，他们的一切罪恶行动必将遭到应有的惩罚。帮助美国扩大对越南的侵略的美国走狗也将遭到惩罚。越南民主共和国政府将坚决地采取一切必要的行动来粉碎美国政府的任何新的罪恶阴谋，保卫祖国的独立和主权，为维护世界和平作出贡献。
    备忘录说，一九六六年一月三十一日，美国飞机明目张胆地恢复对越南北方的轰炸，从而开始了逐步扩大对越南民主共和国的战争的新的罪恶步骤。
    从那时起，空袭日益加剧。一九六六年六月二十四日，美联社承认，美国空袭的次数为“暂停轰炸”之前的百分之二百到三百之间，每月出动九千到一万一千架次。
    美国飞机所投炸弹数量也大大增加。美国国防部长麦克纳马拉承认，单在一九六六年三月份，对越南南方和北方就投了五万吨炸弹，这几乎是侵朝战争期间每月平均投弹量的三倍。他还说，美国计划一九六六年对越南投炸弹六十三万八千吨，“这等于朝鲜战争三十七个月中投弹量的百分之九十一”。
    备忘录说，美国空军的空袭范围也日益扩大。一九六六年六月下旬，开始了美国侵越战争的一个新阶段，美国飞机多批袭击了河内和海防，狂轰滥炸居民区和经济设施。
    备忘录指出，美国统治集团大肆宣扬说什么他们只袭击“军事目标”。事实是，美国飞机继续对大小城市、居民区、学校、医院、水坝、堤堰、国营农场、林场和工厂等蓄意进行狂轰滥炸，破坏公用事业和屠杀平民。
    自从一九六六年二月以来，美国飞机野蛮地袭击了越南北方的海防、南定、太原、荣市、河内，以及十二个省城和二十几个县城。
    越南北方十二个省份的水坝、水闸、灌溉渠和水库等许多水利工程一直是美国空袭的目标。一九六六年二月份以来，对水利工程进行了大大小小七百多次空袭，其中有六十五次空袭的目标是堤堰系统。
    备忘录指出，美国统治集团所谓对“汽油库”和“有选择的目标”进行“精确”袭击，恰恰就是对居民区和公用事业蓄意进行空袭。任何骗人的胡说都不能帮助美国侵略者在舆论和历史面前掩盖他们的滔天罪行。
    美国的战争狂人正在叫嚣在越南北方加紧战争“升级”，继续对河内进行空袭，对海防进行轰炸和封锁。
    备忘录最后说，美国政府必须停止侵略，承认越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线五点声明中所阐明的立场，无条件地完全停止对越南民主共和国的空袭和其他一切战争行动，从越南南方撤走美国及其仆从的全部军队和武器，让越南人民自己来解决他们的事务。只要美帝国主义者还在继续对越南进行侵略战争，越南人民将坚决战斗到最后胜利，即使他们必须战斗十年、二十年或者更长的时间。
