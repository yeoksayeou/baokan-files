Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." After 1958, when the Party Central Committee and the State Council officially announced the policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," the Central Academy of Drama, like other colleges and universities across the country, launched a magnificent educational revolution. The broad masses of teachers and students actively participated in industrial and agricultural production, joined the army, and went to the three great revolutionary movements for tempering.

However, the Gang of Four led by Zhou Yang was extremely dissatisfied with this revolutionary action, deeming it "disrupted the teaching order" and "lowered the teaching quality." To protect the old order of the bourgeoisie and to carry out capitalist restoration in art education, Zhou Yang and his gang of black elements wielded their sticks and rods, vehemently opposing the inheritance and promotion of the revolutionary traditions of our Party and army's art troupes.

On the "May Fourth" Youth Festival in 1960, various art academies held a gathering and performed small-scale singing programs in Zhongshan Park. The Central Academy of Drama also participated. However, after watching the performance, Zhou Yang sternly questioned, "Why did the Central Academy of Drama stage these small singing and dancing programs? I have repeatedly told you not to run the school in the manner of the art troupes, but you just wouldn't listen. You are the highest drama academy in the country. Your task is to impart complete and systematic knowledge of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign arts to your students, to cultivate elite drama artists for performing troupes, and to nurture high-level drama talents. How many famous actors have you cultivated? Whether your academy has achievements depends on whether you can cultivate elite talents, not on whether you cultivate members of the art troupes. Otherwise, what is the point of running various higher art academies?"

Subsequently, Zhou Yang repeatedly emphasized in various occasions his opposition to inheriting and promoting the revolutionary traditions of our Party and army's art troupes in art academies and theaters. The loyal followers of Zhou Yang took his nonsense as "imperial edicts" and immediately implemented them in the Central Academy of Drama and its affiliated experimental drama theater. They cursed the revolutionary teachers and students for "serving politics too much"; they claimed that artistic practice was too much and systematic knowledge was too little; they slandered us for not valuing the training of basic skills, complaining that we had cultivated too few "elite talents"; they said that the educational revolution of 1958 had "committed a directional error." They piled up a series of charges, all aimed at attacking the Party and Chairman Mao's educational policy.

Was it serving politics too much? Chairman Mao teaches us: "The struggle of revolutionary ideas and artistic struggle must be subordinate to political struggle, because only through politics can the needs of the class and the masses be concentratedly expressed." According to this directive, we should integrate serving politics into all aspects of teaching and throughout the entire teaching process. The broad masses of teachers and students, in order to combine with class struggle and production struggle, staged some street performances and small-scale singing programs, collectively created some modern revolutionary plays, and performed for workers, peasants, and soldiers. Is this not what we should do? In this regard, we have not done too much, but too little!

Was artistic practice too much? In the past, we always went from books to books, from classrooms to classrooms, with very little stage art practice. After the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, there was a bit more artistic practice, especially the beginning of performances for workers, peasants, and soldiers, which was a good thing. But just as it started, Zhou Yang and his gang shouted loudly, saying that artistic practice was too much. This was to make us continue to walk the old bourgeois road of "closed-door improvement."

What kind of systematic theoretical knowledge did the Gang of Four advocate learning? They never advocated learning Chairman Mao's works or Marxist class struggle knowledge. They advocated learning the "famous," "foreign," and "ancient" of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign arts, treating the art of the 19th-century European bourgeoisie as classics, claiming it to be "unattainable standards," and wanting us to kneel before the "authority" of bourgeois art.

The Gang of Four cursed us for not cultivating "elite talents," fully exposing their reactionary nature. Chairman Mao pointed out that we should cultivate the youth "to become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." However, Zhou Yang advocated "cultivating high-level drama artists," wanting to produce "elite talents." His so-called "elite talents" do not consider politics at all, but only need to be able to perform emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. The many "elite talents" he praised are all extreme individualists, thorough and thorough bourgeois drama artists. Zhou Yang's opposition to the revolutionary traditions of the art troupes is actually an opposition to running schools and theaters with Mao Zedong Thought. He attempted to lead us down the capitalist and revisionist path.

In the magnificent proletarian cultural revolution, we must definitely seize back all the drama education positions controlled by the Gang of Four and definitely uproot the revisionist roots of the Gang of Four!

### 所谓培养“尖端人材”的反动实质——选自中央戏剧学院的大字报

　　所谓培养“尖端人材”的反动实质
　　——选自中央戏剧学院的大字报
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”一九五八年，党中央和国务院正式公布了“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动结合”的方针以后，中央戏剧学院和全国高等学校一样，掀起了轰轰烈烈的教育革命。广大师生积极参加工农业生产劳动，到连队当兵，到三大革命运动中去锻炼。
    可是，周扬黑帮对这种革命行动极为不满，认为“打乱了教学秩序”，“降低了教学质量”。为了保护资产阶级的旧秩序，在艺术教育中搞资本主义复辟，周扬和他的一伙黑帮挥棍舞棒，竭力反对继承和发扬我党我军文工团、队的革命传统。
    一九六○年“五四”青年节时，各兄弟艺术院校在中山公园联欢并演出了小型演唱节目。中央戏剧学院也参加演出。不料周扬看了以后，竟然声色俱厉地质问：“中央戏剧学院为什么要搞这些小歌舞演唱节目？我几次告诉你们，不要用文工团办法办学，你们就是不听。你们是全国最高的戏剧学府，你们的任务是要给学生传授完整的、系统的古今中外的知识，是给演出团体培养尖子，是培养高级的戏剧艺术人材，话剧界的小生小旦名演员靠你们培养。你们培养出了几个名角？你们学院有没有成绩，就看你们能不能培养几个尖端人材，不是要你们培养文工团员，否则办各种高等艺术院校干什么？”
    接着周扬在各种场合三令五申，反对在艺术院校和剧院里继承和发扬我党我军文工团、队的革命传统。周扬的忠实走卒们把他的胡言乱语当作“圣旨”，立即在中央戏剧学院和附属实验话剧院贯彻。他们咒骂革命师生们“为政治服务太多了”；他们胡说艺术实践太多了，系统知识传授得太少了；他们诬蔑我们不重视基本功锻炼，埋怨我们培养的“尖端人材”太少了；他们说一九五八年教育革命“犯了方向性错误”。加了一连串罪名，目的就是攻击党和毛主席的教育方针。
    是为政治服务太多了吗？毛主席教导我们：“革命的思想斗争和艺术斗争，必须服从于政治的斗争，因为只有经过政治，阶级和群众的需要才能集中地表现出来。”按照这一指示的精神，我们应该把为政治服务贯穿在教学的各个方面，贯穿在教学的始终。广大师生为了结合阶级斗争和生产斗争，排演了一些街头活报剧和小型演唱节目，集体创作了一些革命现代戏，给工农兵送戏上门。这些难道不应该吗？我们在这方面不是做得太多了，而是做得太少了！
    是艺术实践太多了吗？我们以往一向是从书本到书本，从课堂到课堂，很少有舞台艺术实践。一九五七年反右派斗争之后，艺术实践多了一些，特别是开始注意为工农兵演出，这是一件好事。但刚刚开始，周扬及其一伙却大叫大嚷，说什么艺术实践多了。这就是要我们继续走“关门提高”的资产阶级老路。
    周扬黑帮提倡要学习什么样的系统的理论知识呢？他们从来不提倡学习毛主席著作，不提倡学习马克思主义阶级斗争的知识。他们提倡的是学习古今中外的“名”“洋”“古”，把十九世纪欧洲资产阶级的艺术奉为经典，说成是
  “不可企及的典范”，要我们拜倒在资产阶级艺术“权威”的脚下。
    周扬一伙咒骂我们没有培养出“尖子”，也充分暴露了他的反动面目。毛主席指出，我们要把青年培养“成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。而周扬却提倡“培养高级的戏剧艺术人材”，要出“尖子”。他所谓的“尖子”，根本不从政治方面考虑，而只要能演好帝王将相、才子佳人就行。他所吹捧的许多“尖子”，都是一些极端个人主义者，彻头彻尾的资产阶级戏剧艺术接班人。周扬反对文工团的革命传统，实际上就是反对用毛泽东思想办学校，办剧院。他企图把我们引向资本主义、修正主义邪道。
    在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要把周扬黑帮所控制的戏剧教育阵地全部夺回来，一定要把周扬黑帮的修正主义根子连根挖掉！
