	Soldiers Listen Most to Chairman Mao's Words
	In the army, Huang Zushi
	The sunflower faces the red sun,
	Soldiers listen most to Chairman Mao's words.
	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao,
	Whatever you say, we do.
	You say the Party's general line is good,
	We won't leave it for a single step.
	You say we must not forget class struggle,
	We will trample the ghosts and snakes underfoot.
	You say people's war is powerful,
	Six hundred million people take up arms.
	You say the U.S. imperialists are paper tigers,
	We will resolutely expose them!
	You say the working people are one family,
	We will plant the red flag of revolution all over the world.
	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao,
	Your words have the greatest power.
	Soldiers believe in your words,
	Fear neither heaven nor earth.
	We will not be shaken by storms and waves,
	For generations, we will plant the red flag.

    战士最听毛主席的话
    解放军某部　黄祖示葵花向着红太阳，战士最听毛主席的话。毛主席，毛主席，您叫干啥咱就干啥。您说党的总路线好，咱就一步不离它。您说阶级斗争不能忘，咱就把牛鬼蛇神踩脚下。您说人民战争威力大，六亿人民把枪拿。您说美帝是纸老虎，咱就坚决戳穿它！您说劳动人民是一家，咱就把革命红旗插遍天下。毛主席，毛主席，您的话威力最大。战士信仰您的话，天不怕来地不怕。狂风恶浪不动摇，万代都把红旗插。
