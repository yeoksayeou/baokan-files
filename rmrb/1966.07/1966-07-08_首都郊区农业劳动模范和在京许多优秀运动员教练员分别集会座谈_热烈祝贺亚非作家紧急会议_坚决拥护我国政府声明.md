Capital suburban people's commune agricultural labor models held a meeting this afternoon to express their warmest congratulations and support for the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference currently being held in Beijing.

The labor models present unanimously supported the statement issued by our government on July 3 and responded to the emergency appeal of the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people. They also expressed that they are ready, and as soon as the motherland gives the order, they will take all necessary actions to support the Vietnamese people.

An Yushan, the chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association of Sujiatuo People's Commune in Haidian District, said in his speech, "The Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference being held in Beijing makes us poor and lower-middle peasants very happy. This conference is well-organized, and we warmly congratulate its successful conclusion. He condemned the U.S. imperialists' mad bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong. He said, "Such barbaric acts of aggression further expose the wolfish nature of U.S. imperialism. We poor and lower-middle peasants will never allow U.S. imperialism to expand its aggression, and we will definitely eliminate these pests."

Zheng Shuyu, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Jiaodao People's Commune in Fangshan County, and Chen Fengqin, chairwoman of the Women's Federation of Chongguzhuang People's Commune in Fangshan County, said in their speeches, "The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are fearless of death and hardship and are willing to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression and for national salvation together with the Asian-African peoples and all truly anti-imperialist revolutionary peoples in the world. We are fully prepared and ready to take all necessary actions at any time to support the Vietnamese people. They pointed out: "As Chairman Mao said, 'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic.'"

According to Xinhua News Agency, some of our outstanding athletes and coaches in Beijing recently expressed their heartfelt congratulations and strong support for the convening of the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference, pointing out that this conference has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism and modern revisionism.

Recently, the "Sports Daily" invited some outstanding athletes and coaches to hold a discussion meeting. Ping-pong player Zhuang Zedong said at the meeting, "The Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference marks a new stage in the unity and anti-imperialist movement of Asian-African writers, and it is a great victory for the anti-imperialist cause of the Asian-African peoples."

Everyone in their speeches strongly condemned the recent U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, expressing full support for the emergency appeal issued by the conference to firmly support the struggle of the Vietnamese people, and firmly supporting the statement issued by our government on July 3.

Basketball coach Qian Chenghai, swimmer Fu Daijin, and track and field athlete Liu Dehui exposed and condemned the criminal activities of the Soviet revisionist leadership in betraying the fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people.

Volleyball coach Sun Zhi'an and ping-pong player Liu Yajin said, "Under the personal leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people are carrying out an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must fight and overthrow all ghosts and monsters, and resolutely carry the socialist revolution in our country to the end, making a contribution to the world revolution."

The speakers also emphasized that the high evaluation of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought by the representatives of various countries at this conference is a great encouragement to the Chinese people. Go player Chen Zude said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon of the world's revolutionary peoples, and Chairman Mao is the great leader and banner of the world revolution. The Asian-African peoples mastering Mao Zedong Thought will make imperialism perish even faster." All the athletes and coaches present expressed that they will definitely study and master Mao Zedong Thought better, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end.
