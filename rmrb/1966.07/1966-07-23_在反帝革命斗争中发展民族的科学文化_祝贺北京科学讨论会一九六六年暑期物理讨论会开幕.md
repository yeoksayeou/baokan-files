The 1966 Summer Physics Discussion of the Beijing Science Conference opens today. We warmly welcome the scientists from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania who are attending this conference.

We are confident that this summer physics discussion will continue to carry forward the spirit of mutual learning and common progress from the Beijing Science Conference two years ago. It will discuss scientific research achievements, exchange experiences, and further promote the development of national scientific and cultural undertakings in the four continents. It will also strengthen the unity and cooperation among scientists from various countries, thereby making new contributions to the cause of the peoples of various countries in opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, in struggling for and safeguarding national independence, and in defending world peace.

In the present world, all science and technology serve the politics of a certain class. Comrade Mao Zedong has pointed out: "The United States indeed has science and technology, but unfortunately, they are in the hands of the capitalists, not in the hands of the people. Their use is to exploit and oppress internally and to invade and kill externally."

Currently, U.S. imperialism is using its science and technology to carry out frenzied invasions and massacres in Vietnam and many other regions of the world. Meanwhile, the Soviet revisionist leadership, which has become a henchman of U.S. imperialism, is using its science and technology as a tool to realize its dream of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," thereby opposing the revolutionary cause of the peoples of various countries. All scientists with a sense of justice and love for peace cannot but be indignant at this crime of using science and technology to kill people and oppose revolution.

The broad masses of laboring people in the vast regions of the four continents have created brilliant science and culture. However, the invasions of imperialism and colonialism have caused many countries to lose their independence, and their national science and culture have been severely destroyed. Currently, in the favorable situation where the revolutionary peoples of the world are deeply developing their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, with the continuous victories of the national liberation movements in various countries, the national science and culture in these regions are experiencing a period of revival and prosperity. The current major historical task for the peoples and scientific workers of the four continents is to thoroughly eliminate the influence of imperialist science and culture in these regions and to establish a revolutionary, people's, and national science and culture that opposes imperialism.

Over the past seventeen years, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our country's socialist scientific undertakings have achieved tremendous successes. Our country's development of socialist science is guided by Mao Zedong Thought, with class struggle as the key, politics leading business, adhering to the general line of socialism, adhering to the principle of self-reliance, adhering to the combination of intellectuals with workers and peasants, experts with the masses, scientific experiments with production practice, vigorously implementing the mass line, continuously promoting scientific and technological revolutions, making them serve socialist construction, proletarian politics, and the world revolution.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "In the realms of production struggle and scientific experiment, humanity is always developing, and nature is always developing, never stopping at one level. Therefore, humanity must always summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress." Our scientific workers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, regard Chairman Mao's words as the highest directive, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and throw themselves into the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, making tremendous efforts to develop our country's socialist scientific undertakings. Learning from the advanced experiences of various countries in science and technology is an important task for our scientific workers. This summer physics discussion provides our scientific workers with a good opportunity to learn from scientists from various countries.

A magnificent and unprecedented high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is surging in our country. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are criticizing the old ideas and culture used by imperialism and all exploiting classes to poison the laboring people, and are establishing new ideas and culture of socialism and communism. Under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, this cultural revolution will surely achieve thorough victory, greatly promoting the advancement of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and greatly promoting the development of our country's socialist scientific and cultural undertakings.

Now, scientists from the four continents are gathering in Beijing. The Chinese people warmly wish this conference a complete success. The Chinese people and Chinese scientific workers are willing to unite with the peoples and scientific workers of the four continents under the banner of the anti-imperialist revolution, to contribute our strength to opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, to supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, and to developing the national scientific and cultural undertakings of the four continents.

    在反帝革命斗争中发展民族的科学文化
    ——祝贺北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会开幕
    北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会今日开幕。我们热烈欢迎前来参加这次会议的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和大洋洲的科学家们。
    我们深信，这次暑期物理讨论会一定会继续发扬两年前北京科学讨论会上互相学习、共同提高的精神，讨论科学研究成果，交流经验，进一步促进四大洲各国的民族科学文化事业的发展，进一步增强各国科学家的团结合作，从而对各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立，保卫世界和平的事业作出新的贡献。
    在现在的世界上，一切科学技术都是为一定阶级的政治服务的。毛泽东同志曾经指出：“美国确实有科学，有技术，可惜抓在资本家手里，不抓在人民手里，其用处就是对内剥削和压迫，对外侵略和杀人。”
    目前，美帝国主义正利用它的科学技术，在越南和世界其他许多地区进行疯狂的侵略和屠杀。而堕落为美帝国主义帮凶的苏联修正主义领导集团，也正在把它的科学技术，作为实现其“美苏合作主宰世界”美梦的工具，以反对各国人民的革命事业。一切有正义感的、爱好和平的科学家，都不能不因这种把科学技术用于屠杀人民、反对革命的罪行而愤慨万分。
    四大洲广大地区的劳动人民，曾经创造过光辉灿烂的科学和文化。然而，帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略，使这里的许多国家丧失了独立，民族科学文化横遭摧残。目前，在世界革命人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争深入发展的大好形势下，随着各国民族解放运动的不断胜利，这些地区的民族科学文化，正在经历着一个复兴和繁荣的时期。当前四大洲各国人民和科学工作者的一个重大历史任务，就是要彻底肃清帝国主义科学文化对这些地区的影响，建立起反帝革命的、人民大众的、民族的科学文化。
    十七年来，在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我国社会主义科学事业取得了巨大的成就。我国发展社会主义科学事业，是以毛泽东思想为指针，以阶级斗争为纲，政治统帅业务，坚持社会主义总路线，坚持自力更生的方针，坚持知识分子同工农结合，专家同群众结合，科学实验同生产实践结合，大力贯彻群众路线，不断推进科学革命和技术革命，使之为社会主义建设服务，为无产阶级政治服务，为世界革命服务。
    毛泽东同志指出：“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”我国科学工作者，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把毛主席的话当作最高指示，活学活用毛主席著作，投身到阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中去，为发展我国社会主义科学事业作出了巨大的努力。虚心学习各国科学技术上的先进经验，是我国科学工作者的一个重要任务。这次的暑期物理讨论会，就为我国科学工作者提供了一个向各国科学家学习的良好机会。
    一个轰轰烈烈的、史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的高潮正在我国兴起。广大的工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，正在批判帝国主义和一切剥削阶级用来毒害劳动人民的旧思想、旧文化，树立社会主义和共产主义的新思想、新文化。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，这场文化大革命必将取得彻底的胜利，大大推动我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的前进，大大促进我国社会主义科学文化事业的发展。
    现在，四大洲的科学家们正在北京相聚一堂。中国人民热烈预祝这次会议圆满成功。中国人民和中国科学工作者，愿意同四大洲各国人民和科学工作者团结在反帝革命的大旗下，为反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，为支援各国人民革命斗争，为发展四大洲各国的民族科学文化事业而贡献自己的力量。
