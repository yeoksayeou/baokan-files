Ambassador Chen Ziping Condemns U.S. Imperialism's Duplicity and Praises Vietnam-China Solidarity

New China News Agency, July 19th: Today, at a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists, the Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, Chen Ziping, said that in the face of U.S. imperialism's new escalation of the war, the Vietnamese people are united and actively responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call in his "Letter to the Nation," fearing neither hardship nor sacrifice, determined to defeat the American aggressors and push the anti-American, national salvation struggle to final victory.

Ambassador Chen Ziping introduced the current situation of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation and answered questions from Chinese and foreign journalists. He said that on July 17th, Chairman Ho Chi Minh issued his "Letter to the Nation," and on the same day, the Supreme Defense Council of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announced decisions and orders to mobilize a portion of the reserves. All of this shows that the Vietnamese people are determined to resist the U.S. government's plot and actions to intensify the war of aggression. The Johnson administration insists on continuing its aggression in South Vietnam and using its air force to attack the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and it will inevitably face even more resolute resistance from the 31 million Vietnamese people.

Ambassador Chen Ziping condemned U.S. imperialism's desperate attempts to intensify the war of aggression in Vietnam. He said, the more U.S. imperialism intensifies its war of aggression, the more it will suffer heavier and more shameful defeats.

Ambassador Chen Ziping said that the United States must stop its war of aggression in Vietnam, and all U.S. troops and their mercenaries must withdraw from Vietnam. The four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam point to the only correct path to resolve the Vietnamese question and restore true peace in Vietnam. The Ambassador said that some people, such as Sato, Wilson, and Tito, strongly support the U.S. position, trying to cover up the face of U.S. aggression and help the United States permanently occupy South Vietnam, but they will certainly suffer shameful failure. Others are proposing "political solutions" to muddy the Vietnamese question, reversing the roles of the aggressor and the victim or equating the two, and they do not start from recognizing Vietnam's independence, unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. This will not help in correctly resolving the Vietnamese question. They will face opposition from the Vietnamese people and the people of the world.

Ambassador Chen Ziping strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's use of massacre and bombing to force the Vietnamese people to "negotiate" on U.S. terms and achieve U.S. "peace." He said that the U.S. "peace" is nothing more than increasing troops in South Vietnam, bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, permanently occupying South Vietnam, and long-term division of Vietnam. The Vietnamese people not only reject this kind of "negotiation" and "peace" but also expose and foil it.

Ambassador Chen Ziping said that the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation has already and is continuing to receive support from people all over the world. He warmly praised the inseparable, unbreakable fighting friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China, and expressed heartfelt thanks to the Chinese government and people for their consistent and powerful support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

　　陈子平大使向中外记者谴责美帝玩弄两手阴谋
　　越南人民万众一心坚决打败美国强盗
　　赞扬越中人民唇齿相依牢不可破的战斗友谊
    新华社十九日讯　越南民主共和国驻中国大使陈子平今天在他举行的中外记者招待会上说，面对美帝国主义的新的战争“升级”，越南人民万众一心，积极响应胡志明主席在《告全国同胞书》中发出的号召，不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，决心打败美国侵略强盗，把抗美救国的事业推向最后胜利。
    陈子平大使介绍了当前越南人民抗美救国斗争的形势，并回答了中外记者们的问题。他说，今年七月十七日，胡志明主席发表了《告全国同胞书》，同日公布了越南民主共和国最高国防会议公报和越南民主共和国国会常务委员会关于动员一部分后备兵员的决定，以及胡志明主席颁布的关于动员一部分后备兵员的命令。这一切表明：越南人民决心抵抗美国加强侵略战争的阴谋和行动。约翰逊政府执意要继续侵略越南南方并用空军进攻越南民主共和国，它必将遭到三千一百万越南人民的更加坚决的抵抗。
    陈子平大使谴责美帝国主义正在绝望地强化侵略越南的战争。他说，美帝国主义越是强化侵略战争，就将遭到更惨重、更可耻的失败。
    陈子平大使说，美国必须停止侵略越南的战争，美国军队及其帮凶军必须全部撤出越南。越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，指出了解决越南问题和恢复越南真正和平的唯一正确的途径。大使说，有一些人如佐藤、威尔逊、铁托，大力附和美国的论调，竭力掩盖美国的侵略面目，帮助美国永远霸占越南南方，但是他们一定会遭到可耻的失败。另一些人正在提出“政治解决办法”，使越南问题模糊不清，颠倒被侵略者和侵略者或在以上两者之间划上等号，他们不从承认越南的独立、统一、主权和领土完整出发，这是无助于正确地解决越南问题的。他们将遭到越南人民和世界人民的反对。
    陈子平大使强烈谴责美帝国主义用屠杀和炸弹迫使越南人民按照美国的条件来“谈判”，实现美国的“和平”。他说，美国的这种“和平”只不过是增兵越南南方，轰炸越南民主共和国，永远霸占越南南方，长期分割越南。对于这种“谈判”与“和平”，越南人民不仅要拒绝，而且要大加揭露并使之破产。
    陈子平大使说，越南人民的抗美救国的正义斗争，已经和正在得到全世界人民的支持。他热烈赞扬越中两国人民唇齿相依的、牢不可破的战斗友谊，并对中国政府和人民给越南人民抗美救国斗争一贯的、有力的支持，表示衷心的感谢。
