South Vietnamese Liberation Forces Raid Batu Airfield
Destroy and Damage 50 Enemy Aircraft, Kill Over 150 U.S. Soldiers

New China News Agency, Hanoi, July 18 – According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, on the night of July 7, the South Vietnamese Liberation Forces launched a fierce attack on the Batu military airfield in the province of Soc Trang, used by the puppet forces. Preliminary reports indicate that after a 12-minute battle, the Liberation Forces destroyed and damaged a total of 50 aircraft of various types, killed and wounded more than 150 U.S. aggressor troops, and severely damaged a power plant.

Following this raid, all activities at the airfield were paralyzed for three days.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi on July 16, the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam reported that, according to incomplete statistics, in the first half of this year, approximately 2,500 mass political struggles against the U.S.-puppet clique erupted in various towns in the southern western region of South Vietnam, involving over 250,000 participants.

In the provinces of Long An, Soc Trang, and Kien Giang, tens of thousands of farmers marched into the provincial capitals to hold demonstrations. They surrounded the officials of the U.S. aggressors and the puppet provincial governments, protesting against the enemy's spraying of chemical poisons, "sweeping" operations, massacres of the people, and destruction of production. These large-scale and intense struggles have powerfully promoted the struggles of the urban population.

    新华社河内十八日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方解放武装力量，七月七日夜间向芹苴省巴图美伪军用机场发起猛烈袭击。据初步消息，经过十二分钟的战斗，解放武装力量共击毁、击伤各种类型飞机五十架，打死打伤美国侵略军一百五十多名，一座发电厂遭到严重破坏。
    这次袭击以后，这个机场的全部活动瘫痪了三天之久。
    据新华社河内十六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，据不完全统计，今年上半年，在越南南方南部西区的各个城镇里先后爆发了约二千五百次反对美伪集团的群众性的政治斗争，参加的人数达二十五万多人次。
    在永隆、芹苴、金瓯等省，数以万计的农民浩浩荡荡地涌进省会举行了示威游行。他们包围了美国侵略者和伪省政权的官员，反对敌人撒放化学毒药、进行“扫荡”、残杀人民和破坏生产。这些大规模的激烈的斗争有力地促进了城市人民的斗争。
