The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Jilin, and Shanghai provinces and cities have been holding meetings for several days, expressing their readiness to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. Once the Vietnamese people deem it necessary, they will immediately rush to the front lines to join their Vietnamese brothers in fighting against the American aggressors.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have expressed their most enthusiastic and resolute support for Chairman Liu's statement and Chairman Hu's battle proclamation.

On the afternoon of July 27, more than ten thousand people in Yanan, the revolutionary holy land, braved the rain to hold a meeting and parade. Old Red Army soldiers, old Red Guards, old guerrillas, workers, commune members, militiamen, and cadres who participated in the meeting all expressed that the people of Yanan, under the long-term direct guidance of Chairman Mao, have already made up their minds and prepared everything. They are ready to take any action deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam and join the Vietnamese people in fighting against the American aggressors.

Xu Jinshan, deputy secretary of the Yanan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke on behalf of the people of Yanan. He said: Yanan is where Chairman Mao fought. The people of Yanan, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, have a glorious revolutionary tradition of defeating imperialism and all reactionaries. We, the people of Yanan, will definitely carry forward the revolutionary tradition, unite with the people of the whole country, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism, and vow to be a strong rear guard for the Vietnamese people. Gao Guowen, vice-chairman of the Yanan District Federation of Trade Unions, spoke on behalf of the people's organizations in Yanan District and Yanan County. He said that the militiamen of Zaoyuan, where Chairman Mao once lived, are militiamen personally trained by Chairman Mao with a glorious revolutionary fighting tradition. Now, we militiamen of Zaoyuan, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have honed our skills to fight the enemy. We are ready to respond to the call of the motherland and rush to the front lines of the anti-American struggle according to the needs of the Vietnamese people, fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people, and bury the American aggressors in the vast sea of people's war.

In recent days, the masses in cities and rural areas across Jiangxi Province have been sending telegrams, writing letters, and articles to newspapers and radio stations, expressing their determination to unite with the people of the whole country, respond to the call of the motherland at any time, and regardless of the risks and sacrifices, join the Vietnamese people in defeating the American aggressors.

In recent days, dozens of counties (cities) such as Nanchang, Yichun, Pingxiang, Gao'an, and Tongdu have held meetings to severely condemn the heinous crimes of American imperialism and firmly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national liberation. Many workers and family members of industrial and mining enterprises, such as the Horngfeng Textile Machinery Factory, a national model unit like Daqing, the Pingxiang Branch of the East China Coal Company, and the Pingxiang Steel Plant, expressed at the meetings that they will forever stand with the Vietnamese people and firmly support the Vietnamese people to the end. Old worker Yuan Pin'gao of Anshan Coal Mine said: We old workers of Anshan Coal Mine were personally educated by Chairman Mao and Chairman Liu. We have fought against class enemies for a long time. We old workers of Anshan Coal Mine have long hated the American aggressors. We must carry forward the spirit of making revolution in the past, unite with the people of the whole country, and fully support the Vietnamese people to completely annihilate American imperialism. Zhu Weifu, a model militiaman from Rujin County, said: The militiamen of the red capital, rich in glorious revolutionary traditions, listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and love to read Chairman Mao's books the most, and are the most combat-effective. We have already made all preparations for aiding Vietnam and resisting America.

The Shanghai working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has been actively carrying out various activities to aid Vietnam and resist America in recent days. Whether in large or small factories, whether in workshops or offices, red determination letters are posted everywhere. Sailors and workers on Chinese ships sailing in the Bohai Sea and the East China Sea, as well as those docked in foreign ports, have also sent telegrams back to Shanghai, expressing their readiness to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and join their Vietnamese brothers in fighting against the American aggressors. Many workers who participated in the city-wide rally and demonstration to aid Vietnam and resist America said: We will not rest until we drive American imperialism out of Vietnam and defeat it. Yangshupu Power Plant, one of Shanghai's Daqing-style advanced units, five-good worker Gu Yuanzhu, said excitedly at the meeting, "Today, the American aggressors have bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, and owe an even greater blood debt. We Chinese workers have seen through the nature of American imperialism. Invading brother Vietnam is invading China. We firmly support the Vietnamese people to the end."

The entire staff of a geological team of the Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau and all members of a people's militia regiment sent a telegram expressing that once the motherland issues a call, all demobilized, transferred, and retired soldiers will immediately return to the front lines. All workers and militiamen will also, according to the needs of the motherland, unite with the Vietnamese people, fight with them, and win with them, and strive to completely defeat the American aggressors.

In recent days, the broad masses of people in cities and rural areas across Jilin Province have been holding meetings and demonstrations. Tian Renyong, deputy governor of Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, said at the meeting, "The people of all ethnic groups in our autonomous prefecture most enthusiastically and resolutely respond to Chairman Liu's call, follow Chairman Mao's wise teachings, and make our own contributions to supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national liberation, and defeating American imperialism."
