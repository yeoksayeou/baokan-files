	In the golden city of Beijing,
	In that golden city of Beijing, the golden sun rises,
	That is not the sun from the sky,
	It is the radiance of Chairman Mao's thoughts.

	In that golden city of Beijing,
	The bright lake water shimmers with gold,
	That is not the lake water shimmering with gold,
	It is the brilliance of Chairman Mao's works shining brightly.

	In that golden city of Beijing,
	The majestic bugle call echoes through the heavens,
	That is not the bugle call echoing through the heavens,
	It is the voice of Chairman Mao spreading far and wide.

    在金色的北京城
    （藏族民歌）在那金色的北京城呵，升起了金色的太阳，那不是天上的太阳，是毛主席的思想放红光。在那金色的北京城呵，明亮的湖水闪金光，那不是湖水闪金光，是毛主席的著作光芒万丈。在那金色的北京城呵，雄壮的号角震天响，那不是号角震天响，是毛主席的声音传四方。
