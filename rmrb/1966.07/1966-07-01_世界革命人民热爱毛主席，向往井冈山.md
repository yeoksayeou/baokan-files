	Mao Zedong
	The flags below the mountain are in sight, the drums and horns on the mountain peak resonate. The enemy army surrounds us with countless layers, but we stand firm and unyielding.	Early on, we had already built a strong defense, and now our resolve is even stronger. The cannon fire on Huangyan Ridge roars, announcing the enemy's night retreat.
	Longing for Jinggangshan is to admire Chairman Mao
	The first revolutionary base area established by Chairman Mao, Jinggangshan, is a revolutionary holy land yearned for by the revolutionary people of the world. In recent years, thousands of revolutionary friends from nearly a hundred countries on five continents have come to Jinggangshan to visit and tour. They regard the Jinggangshan base area established by Chairman Mao as the "great revolutionary base area of the world." They consider the thoughts of Chairman Mao in establishing the Jinggangshan base area as the "common wealth of the world's proletariat." A revolutionary fighter from Latin America said: "When we talk about the world revolution, we think of Comrade Mao Zedong; when we talk about Comrade Mao Zedong, we think of the Chinese revolution; when we talk about the Chinese revolution, we think of Jinggangshan." "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest revolutionary leader and the most outstanding revolutionary teacher of our time. After we have a detailed understanding of the struggle in Jinggangshan, we feel even more his glory, correctness, and greatness."

	Many foreign revolutionary friends, because of their deep revolutionary feelings for Chairman Mao and Jinggangshan, feel particularly close to everything in Jinggangshan. During their visits, some people peel a bit of mud from the earth walls of Chairman Mao's former residence, some pick a few small stones by the stone where Chairman Mao sat, and some pick a few green leaves from the tree where Chairman Mao rested while carrying grain, cherishing them as souvenirs. A friend from Zanzibar, while visiting Ciping, knelt by the clear stream and drank deeply. He said to his companions: "Drink, comrades! This is the water Chairman Mao drank, drinking it will make your heart clear and your eyes bright." A friend from Colombia had longed for Jinggangshan for a long time. As soon as he arrived on Jinggangshan, he became particularly excited. As soon as the car reached the sentry post at Tongmu Ridge, he took a deep breath and said to the Chinese comrades in the car: "The air in Jinggangshan is particularly fresh and sweet, it is the air purified by the revolutionary storm of Comrade Mao Zedong!" At that time, it was mid-summer, the sun was blazing, and it was very hot. But this friend insisted on not wearing a straw hat. He said: "I need the sun, I need the sun of Mao Zedong Thought, the sun of China. This sun rises from Jinggangshan, I particularly like the sun of Jinggangshan!"

	Last July, a delegation from a Latin American country, under the scorching sun, visited Chairman Mao's former residence in Daping. The house where Chairman Mao once lived in Daping was burned down by the enemy more than thirty years ago, leaving only a mud wall. In 1960, the people of Jinggangshan rebuilt the house and embedded the old wall in the new wall. The old insurgent leader of Daping, Zhou Wenkai, specially introduced the old wall. The delegation leader stroked the uneven wall surface and asked: "This wall is made of mud, can it withstand decades of wind and rain?" Zhou Wenkai replied emotionally: "It can. For decades, whenever there was a stormy night, we would cover the top of the wall with cypress bark to prevent the rain from falling on the wall. In the difficult days before liberation, even if our own houses leaked like sieves, we would use the last piece of cypress bark to protect this wall. Because when we see the wall, we think of Comrade Mao living in this house, we miss Comrade Mao..." The leader, moved, gently peeled off a bit of the wall soil, wrapped it up, and carefully stored it, then tightly held Zhou Wenkai's hand and said: "I understand, comrade, this wall is not made of mud, it is built with your love for the great leader. We also love Chairman Mao as much as you do. Without him, you would not have been liberated; without him, our revolution would not have been victorious. We love Chairman Mao as strongly as you do!"

	Read Chairman Mao's books, walk the path of Jinggangshan
	The reason why foreign revolutionary friends love Chairman Mao and Jinggangshan so much is that they need Chairman Mao, this greatest revolutionary teacher, they need the great Mao Zedong Thought, they need a revolutionary base area like Jinggangshan. A friend from an Asian country wrote a poem after visiting Jinggangshan, which said: "Jinggangshan, do you know, the great Mao Zedong Thought has taken deep roots in all of China, its sun-like radiance is illuminating the rivers and mountains of the whole world!"

	A friend from Japan said when talking about Mao Zedong Thought: "Now it is not enough to say that Mao Zedong Thought is the model of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and Chinese revolutionary practice. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the most alive and highest Marxism-Leninism, the universal truth guiding the world revolution." Many foreign friends believe that the experience and theory created by Chairman Mao in Jinggangshan are applicable to the people's revolutionary struggles in many countries.

	Foreign friends said that they came to Jinggangshan to learn Mao Zedong Thought and to learn the revolutionary spirit of Jinggangshan. Therefore, during their visits, they always eagerly read Chairman Mao's books, especially the books written by Chairman Mao in Jinggangshan. Some of them brought "The Struggle in Jinggangshan," "Why Can the Red Political Power in China Exist?," "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," and other works of Chairman Mao, listening to introductions while comparing and studying them carefully. A member of the Lao People's Union delegation, tired from the journey, as soon as he got off the car, went to the bookstand in the hotel to find Chairman Mao's works. When he found the French version of "Why Can the Red Political Power in China Exist?" written by Chairman Mao in Jinggangshan, he was overjoyed and immediately took it to his room to read. Many foreign friends often discussed and studied Chairman Mao's works after visiting all day. A friend from Southeast Asia said: "The time I spent in Jinggangshan is the golden age of my life. In forty years, I have not learned as much Marxism-Leninism as I did in one month in China." A friend from Congo (Brazzaville) visited Ninggang during the day, traveling over a hundred miles through the mountains, visiting four or five sites, and was very tired. But he still read Chairman Mao's works related to Jinggangshan until late at night, past two o'clock. The next day, everyone advised him to rest more, but he said: "I came to learn Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's books and the spirit of Jinggangshan have given me boundless strength, I don't feel tired at all." A revolutionary friend from Zanzibar, while visiting the former residence of Chairman Mao in Daping, asked why a stone in front of the door was surrounded by a red wooden railing. The Chinese comrade told him that Chairman Mao used to sit on this stone every morning to read or think about revolutionary affairs. The friend, moved, circled the stone several times. Then, holding Chairman Mao's works, he sat on the stone and said to the accompanying Chinese comrade: "Please take a photo of me. Let me sit forever on the place where Chairman Mao sat, be inspired by the spirit of Jinggangshan, and be enlightened by Mao Zedong Thought. Forever read Chairman Mao's books, walk the path of Jinggangshan."

	The path of Jinggangshan is the necessary path for the victory of the world revolution
	A friend from Brazil, after visiting Jinggangshan, excitedly told the Chinese comrades who saw him off: "To find a path to liberate Brazil, I have been looking for decades. Today, I found it in China, it is the path of Jinggangshan!"

	The path of Jinggangshan is the path of encircling the cities from the countryside personally opened by Chairman Mao, the path of armed struggle, the path of relying on the peasants to build rural base areas. A friend from the Dominican Republic said: "Without the Jinggangshan of the past, there would be no victory of the Chinese revolution, without the victory of the Chinese revolution, there would be no victory of the Dominican revolution, there would be no victory of the world revolution. The path of Jinggangshan is the necessary path for revolutionary victory."

	To walk the path of Jinggangshan, armed struggle must be carried out. Because the struggle in Jinggangshan is a military struggle, it is a people's war. This is an important conclusion drawn by many foreign friends after visiting Jinggangshan. The leader of the Lao People's Union delegation said: "Chairman Mao's theory of armed struggle is very correct. Without armed struggle, there is nothing for the people, the struggle in Jinggangshan has proven this truth. Our struggle in Laos has also proven this truth. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: The enemy is not defeated unless it is fought. We must definitely defeat American imperialism." A friend from South Vietnam paid special attention to Chairman Mao's people's war thought. He asked the old district cadres, old Red Guards, and old insurgent teams of the old Soviet area in Jinggangshan in detail about the situation of Chairman Mao's arming the masses in the past, how the insurgent teams, Red Guards, and various mass organizations carried out activities, and how they cooperated with the Red Army in combat. He said: "We are currently fighting a revolutionary war, we are in great need of Comrade Mao Zedong's people's war thought. The victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation is the victory of Mao Zedong's people's war thought." A friend from Vietnam said that the Chinese revolution "developed from muskets to atomic bombs, this is the great revolutionary history of 700 million Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, this is a shining example for all oppressed nations."

	To walk the path of Jinggangshan and carry out armed struggle, revolutionary base areas must be established. Many revolutionary fighters who have participated in armed struggle have shared their experiences. A friend from Venezuela said: "Armed struggle must have a strong and solid rural revolutionary base area as a support to achieve revolutionary victory. Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of base areas is a summary of the experience of the Chinese revolution. When Comrade Mao Zedong went to Jinggangshan, the military strength was small, but in the critical moment of the revolution, he saved the Chinese revolution, and finally achieved great victory in a country with a population of 700 million. Why? Under the brilliant and wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, revolutionary base areas were established, which is an important reason, the fundamental reason. We in Venezuela also have similar lessons. We will do as Comrade Mao Zedong did, go to the mountains, to the countryside to establish revolutionary base areas, accumulate and expand revolutionary forces, use the countryside to surround the cities, and finally seize the cities to achieve our revolutionary victory!"

	Some foreign revolutionary friends, when evaluating the great significance of the struggle in Jinggangshan, said: "The establishment of the Jinggangshan base area is a great contribution of the Chinese people to the international proletariat. May all revolutionary people of the world draw lessons from it in the struggle against imperialism and world reactionaries," "The experience here is very beneficial to us, we will definitely combine the experience and methods here with our own country's specific situation and use them in our struggle."

	The path of Jinggangshan is also the path of mobilizing the peasant masses deeply, relying on the peasant masses to carry out the land revolution, and mobilizing tens of millions of peasants to liberate themselves. Otherwise, there will be no victory in armed struggle, and there will be no consolidation and development of base areas. This is another important enlightenment obtained by many foreign revolutionary friends after visiting Jinggangshan. A friend from Latin America said: "Comrade Mao Zedong's words are absolutely correct: The Chinese revolutionary war is actually a peasant revolutionary war. The struggle in Jinggangshan made me realize this more deeply. We used to pay attention to the workers' movement, but paid less attention to the peasant problem, which is a great loss. The peasants account for a large proportion of the population in my country, and it is impossible to achieve victory without mobilizing the peasants." Some foreign friends who have done peasant work also gained new inspiration from Chairman Mao's struggle to mobilize the peasant masses in Jinggangshan. A foreign friend said: "I have done peasant work in the past and have considered the peasant problem, but after visiting Jinggangshan, I feel that our understanding of the peasants is still not enough. We have not studied the peasant problem as deeply as Comrade Mao Zedong, nor have we understood it as thoroughly. Among our comrades, there are still many who think that winning over the peasants is a simple matter, it can be done with a call. We must, based on Comrade Mao Zedong's experience in Jinggangshan, re-study the peasant problem, especially how to deeply mobilize the masses in terms of ideology, to lay a solid foundation for the base area." A guerrilla fighter from Congo (Kinshasa) said: "Comrade Mao Zedong's land revolution theory is completely correct. We in Africa have vast and fertile land, but not an inch is in the hands of poor peasants. We have taken back the land, and we will definitely get the support of the peasants and achieve victory." Another friend from Black Africa said: "Chairman Mao's theory on the peasant problem is very great. Revolution must rely on the peasants, the peasants are the most reliable allies of the working class. These revolutionary experiences must be learned and applied by today's revolutionaries." An old revolutionary fighter from Latin America had a deeper understanding, saying: "The revolutionary period needs Comrade Mao Zedong's self-reliance thought, and building socialism also needs self-reliance. Now some socialist countries have fallen into the quagmire of revisionism because they want to rely on others to live. This is a heavy lesson that goes against Mao Zedong Thought."

	The star of fire in Jinggangshan will surely spread all over the world
	Friends from all five continents of the world, through their visits and tours in Jinggangshan, have a deeper love, faith, and admiration for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They sincerely praise Chairman Mao as "the red sun in our hearts," "the greatest revolutionary teacher," "Mao Zedong Thought is the highest peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism," "Every word of Comrade Mao Zedong is a guide and textbook for the revolutionary people of the world." Once, the female militia of Jinggangshan, who performed a shooting demonstration for a foreign guest, said: "We have Chairman Mao, so we are not afraid of imperialism." The guest smiled and said: "Chairman Mao is not only yours, but also ours. His resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit, his people's war thought, also point out the path to victory for us."

	In the grand hall of the Jinggangshan Revolutionary Museum, there hangs the eight golden characters "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" by Chairman Mao. This makes all visiting foreign friends feel particularly close and greatly inspired. An old guerrilla fighter from Laos said: "Seeing the eight characters 'A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire' in Jinggangshan, it makes one full of strength and confidence. I seem to see the flash of the first spark lit by Chairman Mao, and see it burn into a lighthouse shining in all directions, illuminating the revolutionary path of the people of the world." A friend from Rwanda, who came to Jinggangshan in spring, was covered with rhododendron petals during his visit to Huangyan Ridge. A comrade wanted to brush them off for him, but he said: "Let them stay on my body! This is the spark of Jinggangshan, 'A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire,' I will take the fire of Jinggangshan to burn across the entire Africa!" American black leader Robert F. Williams said: "The spirit of Jinggangshan is precisely the spark that ignites the prairie fire, from Jinggangshan came the thunder that shook the world." A friend from New Zealand said: "The spark of Jinggangshan is still burning, riding the east wind of Jinggangshan, it is burning in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and it will surely spread all over the world!" An Albanian comrade excitedly said: "May the unliberated capitalist countries of the world all have a Jinggangshan!"

	There is no difficult task in the world, as long as one is willing to climb. The revolutionary people of the world who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought are striving to climb to the peak of revolutionary victory! The revolutionary flames of Jinggangshan will surely spread all over the world, and a brand-new world will be born in the flames.

### 世界革命人民热爱毛主席，向往井冈山

专栏：

    西江月  井冈山　一九二八年秋
    毛泽东
    山下旌旗在望，山头鼓角相闻。敌军围困万千重，我自岿然不动。　早已森严壁垒，更加众志成城。黄洋界上炮声隆，报道敌军宵遁。
    向往井冈山，就是敬仰毛主席
    毛主席亲手创建的第一个革命根据地井冈山，是世界革命人民衷心向往的革命圣地。近几年来，已有五大洲近百个国家的成千名革命朋友来到井冈山参观访问。他们把毛主席创建的井冈山根据地，当作“世界革命的伟大革命根据地”。他们把毛主席在井冈山创建根据地的思想，看成是“世界无产阶级的共同财富”。一位拉丁美洲的革命战士说：“当我们谈到世界革命的时候，就想到毛泽东同志；当我们谈到毛泽东同志的时候，就想到中国革命；当我们谈到中国革命的时候，就想到井冈山。”“毛泽东同志，是当代世界最伟大的革命领袖，最杰出的革命导师。当我们详细地了解井冈山斗争之后，更感到他的光荣、正确和伟大。”
    许多外国革命朋友，由于对毛主席，对井冈山有深厚的革命感情，因此对井冈山的一切都感到特别亲切。在参观时，有的人从毛主席旧居的土墙上剥一点泥土，有的在毛主席坐过的石头边拾几粒小石子，有的在毛主席背粮休息过的路边树上采几片绿叶，珍贵地留作纪念。桑给巴尔的一位朋友在茨坪参观时，伏在小河边畅饮清澈的流水。他对同伴们说：“喝吧，同志们！这是毛主席喝过的水，喝了会心明眼亮。”一位哥伦比亚的朋友，向往井冈山已经很久了，他一到井冈山上就显得特别兴奋。汽车刚上桐木岭哨口，他就大口地、深深地呼吸，并且对同车的中国同志说：“井冈山的空气特别新鲜，特别甜润，这是毛泽东同志用革命的暴风雨洗涤过的空气！”那时正是盛夏，太阳当头照，十分炎热。可是这位朋友说什么也不肯戴上草帽。他说：“我需要太阳，需要毛泽东思想的太阳，中国的太阳。这个太阳正是从井冈山升起的，我特别喜欢井冈山的太阳！”
    去年七月，一个拉丁美洲国家的代表团，在火热的阳光下，参观了毛主席在大井的旧居。毛主席在大井住过的这栋房子，在三十多年前就被敌人烧毁了，只剩下一堵土墙。一九六○年，井冈山的人民把这栋房子重新盖起来，并且把那堵土墙嵌在新墙之中。大井老暴动队长邹文楷，特别介绍了那堵旧墙。代表团团长抚着凹凸不平的墙面问道：“这墙是泥土筑的，能经得住几十年风雨的冲刷吗？”邹文楷深情地回答说：“经住了。几十年来，每逢暴风雨的夜晚，我们就用杉皮把墙头盖好，不让大雨落在墙上。在解放前的艰苦岁月里，我们那怕自己房屋漏得象筛子一样，也要用最后一块杉皮保护这块墙。因为我们见到墙，就想到毛委员在这栋房里住过，就想念毛委员……”。团长激动地轻轻地剥了一点墙土，把它包好，珍贵地收藏起来，然后紧握邹文楷的手说：“我懂了，同志，这堵墙不是泥土筑的，这是你们用对伟大领袖的热爱筑的。我们也和你们一样热爱毛主席，没有他，你们得不到解放；没有他，我们的革命就不能胜利。我们爱毛主席和你们爱得一样强烈！”
    读毛主席的书，走井冈山的路
    外国革命朋友所以这样热爱毛主席，热爱井冈山，是因为他们需要毛主席这位最伟大的革命导师，需要伟大的毛泽东思想，需要井冈山这样最伟大的革命根据地。亚洲国家的一位朋友参观井冈山后激动地写了一首诗，诗中写道：“井冈山，你可知道，伟大的毛泽东思想，在全中国扎下了深根，它的红日般的光辉，正在照耀着全世界的河山！”
    日本的一位朋友在谈到毛泽东思想时说道：“现在仅仅说毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义和中国革命实践相结合的典范，这是不够的。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的最高峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是指导世界革命的普遍真理。”许多外国朋友认为，毛主席在井冈山的斗争经验和他所创造的理论，对很多国家的人民革命斗争都是适用的。
    外国朋友们说，他们来到井冈山，是来学习毛泽东思想，是来学习井冈山的革命精神的。因此，他们在参观过程中，总是如饥似渴地读毛主席的书，特别是读毛主席在井冈山写的书。他们有的带着《井冈山的斗争》、《中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？》、《星星之火，可以燎原》等毛主席著作，一边听介绍，一边聚精会神地对照学习。老挝工会代表团的一位团员，风尘仆仆，一下汽车，就到宾馆书台上找毛主席著作。当他发现毛主席在井冈山写的《中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？》的法文本时，如获至宝，立即拿到房间里阅读。许多外国朋友往往白天参观了一天，晚上还要讨论研究，继续学习毛主席著作。东南亚国家的一位朋友说：“我在井冈山的时刻，是我一生的黄金时代。我四十年来学的，没有在中国一个月学的马克思列宁主义多。”刚果（布）的一位朋友，白天到宁冈参观，往返翻山一百余里，一路看了四、五个参观点，本来是十分疲乏了。可是，他晚上还要读毛主席写的有关井冈山的著作，一直读到深夜两点多。第二天，大家劝他多休息一会，他说：“我是来学习毛泽东思想的，毛主席的书，井冈山的精神，给了我无穷的力量，我一点也不觉得累。”桑给巴尔的一位革命朋友，在参观大井毛主席的旧居时，问起门前的一块石头为什么要用红木栏杆围起来。中国同志告诉他，当年毛主席每天早晨都坐在这块石头上看书或考虑革命大事。这位朋友激动地环绕着这块石头转了几个圈。然后，手捧毛主席著作，坐在石头上对陪同的中国同志说：“请你给我拍张照片吧，让我永远永远坐在毛主席坐过的地方，受到井冈山精神的鼓舞，受到毛泽东思想的启发。永远读毛主席的书，走井冈山的路。”
    井冈山的路，是世界革命胜利必经之路
    一位巴西的朋友，在参观井冈山之后，兴奋地对送行的中国同志说：“为了寻找一条巴西解放的道路，我找了几十年。今天，我在中国找到了，这就是井冈山的道路！”
    井冈山的道路，就是毛主席亲手开创的农村包围城市的道路，就是武装斗争的道路，就是依靠农民，建立农村根据地的道路。一位多米尼加的朋友说：“没有当年的井冈山，就没有中国革命的胜利，没有中国革命的胜利，就没有多米尼加革命的胜利，就没有世界革命的胜利。井冈山的道路，是革命胜利的必经之路。”
    要走井冈山的道路，就必须进行武装斗争。因为井冈山的斗争，就是军事斗争，就是人民战争。这是许多外国朋友参观井冈山后的一个重要结论。老挝工会代表团团长说：“毛主席关于武装斗争的理论是十分正确的。没有武装斗争，就没有人民的一切，井冈山的斗争证明了这个真理。我们老挝的斗争，同样证明了这个真理。正如毛泽东同志所说：敌人是不打不倒的。我们一定要把美帝国主义打倒。”越南南方的一位朋友对毛主席的人民战争思想特别关注。他向井冈山的老苏区干部、老赤卫队员、老暴动队员，详细地了解毛主席当年武装群众的情况，了解暴动队、赤卫队和各种群众组织如何开展活动，如何配合红军作战。他说：“我们正在进行革命战争，我们非常需要毛泽东同志的人民战争思想。越南人民抗美救国斗争的胜利，就是毛泽东人民战争思想的胜利。”一位越南朋友说，中国革命“从土枪发展到原子弹，这是七亿中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下的伟大革命历史，这是一切被压迫民族的光辉榜样。”
    要走井冈山的道路，搞武装斗争，还必须建立革命根据地。许多参加过武装斗争的革命战士，用自己切身的经历说出了他们的体会。委内瑞拉的一位朋友说：“武装斗争，必须要有强大巩固的农村革命根据地为依托，才能取得革命的胜利。毛泽东同志关于根据地的理论，是中国革命的经验总结。毛泽东同志上井冈山的时候，兵力很少，却在革命危急的关头挽救了中国革命，最后在一个七亿人口的国家里取得了伟大的胜利。原因在那里呢？在毛泽东同志天才的、英明的领导下，建立了革命的根据地，是一个重要的原因，根本的原因。我们委内瑞拉也有类似的教训。我们将象毛泽东同志所做的那样，到山区，到农村去建立革命根据地，积蓄和扩大革命力量，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市，来取得我们革命的胜利！”
    有的外国革命朋友在评价井冈山斗争的伟大意义时这样说：“井冈山根据地的建立，是中国人民对国际无产阶级的一个重大贡献。愿全世界革命人民在反对帝国主义和世界反动派的斗争中，从中汲取教益”，“这里的经验对我们非常有益，我们决心将这里的经验、办法，结合自己国家的具体情况，用到我们的斗争中去。”
    井冈山的道路，也是深入发动农民群众，紧紧依靠农民群众进行土地革命，把千万农民动员起来自己解放自己的道路。否则，就不会有武装斗争的胜利，不会有根据地的巩固和发展。这是许多外国革命朋友，在参观井冈山后得到的又一条重要启示。拉丁美洲的一位朋友说：“毛泽东同志的话对极了：中国革命战争，实际上是农民革命战争。井冈山的斗争，使我更深刻地认识了这一点。我们过去注意工人运动，而对农民问题注意不够，这是一个很大的损失。我国人口中农民占了很大的比例，不把农民发动起来，是不可能取得胜利的。”一些搞过农民运动的外国朋友，也从毛主席在井冈山发动农民群众的斗争中，得到新的启发。一位外国朋友说：“我过去做过农民工作，对农民问题有过考虑，但是参观井冈山后，我觉得我们对农民的了解还是很不够的。没有象毛泽东同志那样，对农民问题作那么深入的研究，有那么透彻的了解。我们的同志当中，还有许多人认为争取农民是一件简单的事，可以一呼而起。我们必须根据毛泽东同志在井冈山的经验，重新研究农民问题，特别是如何从思想上深入发动群众，以打下根据地的扎实基础。”刚果（利）的一位游击战士说：“毛泽东同志的土地革命理论完全正确。我们非洲有广阔富饶的土地，但是一寸也不在贫苦农民手里。我们夺回了土地，就得到了农民的支持，也必将取得胜利。”另一位来自黑非洲的朋友说：“毛主席关于农民问题的理论，是非常伟大的。革命必须依靠农民，农民是工人阶级最可靠的同盟军。这些革命经验，今天的革命者必须学会运用。”一位拉丁美洲的老革命战士体会更加深刻，他说：“革命时期需要毛泽东同志的自力更生思想，建设社会主义，也还要自力更生。现在有些社会主义国家，就是由于要依赖别人过活而堕入修正主义的泥坑。这是违背毛泽东思想的沉重教训。”
    井冈山的星星之火必将燃遍全世界
    来自世界五大洲的各国朋友，通过在井冈山的参观、访问，对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，更加热爱，更加信仰，更加崇拜。他们由衷地称颂毛主席是“我们心中的红太阳”，“最伟大的革命导师”，“毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的最高峰”，“毛泽东同志的每一句话对世界革命人民来说是向导，是教科书”。有一次，为客人举行射击表演的井冈山女民兵对一位外国朋友说：“我们有了毛主席，所以不怕帝国主义”。这位客人笑着说：“毛主席不光是你们的，也是我们的。他的坚定、彻底的革命精神，他的人民战争思想，也为我们指出了胜利的道路”。
    井冈山革命博物馆的大厅里，挂着毛主席的“星星之火，可以燎原”八个金字。这使所有来访的外国朋友，感到特别亲切，得到了巨大的鼓舞。一位老挝的游击战士说：“在井冈山看见‘星星之火，可以燎原’这八个字，叫人浑身充满力量和信心。我好象看见毛主席点着第一颗火星的闪光，看见它燃成一座光芒四射的灯塔，照耀着全世界人民革命的道路。”卢旺达一位朋友，在春天来到井冈山，在参观黄洋界时，沾了一身杜鹃花瓣，一个同志要替他拂去，他说：“让它沾在我的身上吧！这是井冈山的火星，‘星星之火，可以燎原’，我要带着井冈山的火，去烧遍整个非洲！”美国黑人领袖罗伯特·威廉说：“井冈山精神正是引起燎原的星星之火，从井冈山发出了震撼世界的风雷。”一位新西兰的朋友说：“井冈山的星星之火还在燃烧，趁着井冈山的东风，在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲燃烧，它必将燃遍全世界！”阿尔巴尼亚的一位同志兴奋地说：“愿未解放的资本主义世界各国，都有一座井冈山！”
    世上无难事，只要肯攀登。掌握了毛泽东思想的世界革命人民，正在向革命胜利的顶峰奋力攀登！井冈山的革命烈火必将燃遍全世界，一个崭新的世界必将在烈火中诞生。
