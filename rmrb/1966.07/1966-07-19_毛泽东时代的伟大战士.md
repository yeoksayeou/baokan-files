In our great era, the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the land, and a new generation of communists is rapidly growing. The Shenyang troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have produced another Lei Feng-like good soldier of Chairman Mao, a hero like Ouyang Hai and Wang Jie—Comrade Liu Yingjun. This is the glory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the glory of the entire Party and the people of the whole country, and the glory of our era.

Comrade Liu Yingjun's life was one of studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought; it was a life of completely, thoroughly, and wholeheartedly serving the people; it was a life of consciously revolving, continuously revolving, and thoroughly revolving; it was a glorious, great, and fighting life of a proletarian revolutionary warrior. Comrade Liu Yingjun loved Chairman Mao immensely and diligently studied Chairman Mao's works. He was a model executor of Chairman Mao's instructions, a red propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought, and a fearless warrior defending Mao Zedong Thought. He resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's military thoughts and lines, firmly emphasizing politics. He earnestly carried out Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thoughts and lines, actively promoting the fighting and mass nature of the company's cultural activities. He was selfless, dedicated to others, and did countless good deeds for the Party and the people. He possessed a high spirit of self-criticism and self-revolution, consciously using Mao Zedong Thought to transform his worldview. To protect the lives of the people, he fearlessly faced danger, sacrificed himself to save others, and bravely gave his precious life, most vividly demonstrating his great revolutionary spirit and noble moral character. He died for the people, and his death is heavier than Mount Tai. He has set a brilliant example for our broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals. His heroic image will forever stand like the white mountains and black waters, evergreen like the pines and cypresses. He will forever live in our hearts, forever inspiring us to march forward to victory.

“When looking at heroes, today is the best.” Comrade Liu Yingjun is only twenty-one years old this year. He is so young, his thoughts are so pure, his character is so noble, and his revolutionary deeds are so great, fully embodying the essence of a proletarian revolutionary warrior, which is something that no heroes of any previous generation can compare to. Born into a poor peasant family and growing up in the new society, he has deep class feelings, which are important conditions for him to grow into a great communist warrior. However, the most important and fundamental reason for his rapid progress, from an ordinary youth to a highly politically conscious proletarian revolutionary warrior, is the result of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. This is also the necessary path for all contemporary heroes. The emergence of Liu Yingjun once again proves this truth: those armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the greatest political foresight, the greatest fighting spirit, the greatest spirit of self-sacrifice, the firmest, bravest, most upright, and wisest. They can overcome any difficulty, defeat any enemy, and create any miracle.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a new-type people's army personally created by Chairman Mao, a heroic force that is highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready, and a great school for studying Mao Zedong Thought. In this school, a large number of heroic and model figures have been cultivated, and Comrade Liu Yingjun is one of the outstanding representatives. Now, the people of the entire country are learning from the PLA. We must all, like the PLA, enthusiastically respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, emphasize politics, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and turn every industry into a great school for studying Mao Zedong Thought. We must cultivate tens of millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and a new generation of communists like Liu Yingjun. This is the hope of the Chinese revolution and the hope of the world revolution.

The appearance of Comrade Liu Yingjun's brilliant deeds will undoubtedly have a great and far-reaching impact on people's spiritual outlook and revolutionary cause. All comrades should learn from him, and the Party, government, military, and people of the Northeast region should learn even better. The younger generation should learn from him, and we old comrades should also learn from him. In our era, regardless of one's position or seniority, as long as one holds the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought high and studies and applies Chairman Mao's works well, he is our learning example. Currently, the class struggle at home and abroad is extremely sharp and complex. Internationally, “the seas are roaring with waves, and the continents are shaking with thunder”; domestically, a great proletarian cultural revolution that touches people's souls is deeply developing. We should extensively and deeply carry out the activity of learning from Comrade Liu Yingjun, further implement emphasizing politics, better launch a new high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, further promote the thought revolutionization of the people, better promote the great proletarian cultural revolution and the three great revolutionary movements, and make new contributions in the struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

Let us march forward with high spirits under the great banner of Mao Zedong!

    毛泽东时代的伟大战士
　　宋任穷
    在我们伟大的时代里，毛泽东思想的光芒普照大地，共产主义一代新人迅速成长。中国人民解放军沈阳部队，又出现了一个雷锋式的毛主席好战士，欧阳海、王杰式的英雄刘英俊同志，这是中国人民解放军的光荣，是全党和全国人民的光荣，是我们时代的光荣。
    刘英俊同志的一生，是学习、贯彻、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想的一生；是完全彻底、全心全意为人民服务的一生；是自觉革命、不断革命、彻底革命的一生；是一个无产阶级革命战士光荣、伟大、战斗的一生。刘英俊同志无比地热爱毛主席，勤奋地学习毛主席著作。他是一个把毛主席的书当作最高指示的模范执行者，是毛泽东思想的红色宣传员，是捍卫毛泽东思想的无畏战士。他坚决贯彻毛主席建军思想、建军路线，坚定不移地突出政治。他认真执行毛主席文艺思想、文艺路线，积极开展连队战斗性、群众性的文娱活动。他毫不利己，专门利人，为党、为人民做了数不尽的好事。他具有高度的自我批评和自我革命的精神，自觉地用毛泽东思想改造世界观。他为了保卫人民群众的生命安全，临危不惧，舍身救人，英勇地献出了自己的宝贵生命，最集中地表现了他的伟大革命精神和高尚道德品质。他为人民而死，死得比泰山还重。他为我们广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，树立了一个光辉的榜样。他的英雄形象，象白山黑水一样，永世长存；象苍松翠柏一样，万古长青。他将永远活在我们的心里，永远鼓舞我们胜利前进。
      “数风流人物，还看今朝”。刘英俊同志今年仅仅二十一岁，他那样年轻，思想那样纯洁，品质那样高尚，革命行为那样伟大，集中表现了无产阶级革命战士的本色，这是历代任何所谓英雄人物根本无法比拟的。他出生于贫农家庭，在新社会长大，具有浓厚的阶级感情，这是他成长为一个伟大共产主义战士的重要条件。但是，他能够进步得那样快，从一个普通青年飞跃成为一个具有高度政治觉悟的无产阶级革命战士，最重要、最根本的原因，是毛泽东思想哺育的结果，这也是当代一切英雄人物成长的必由之路。刘英俊的出现，再次证明了这样一个真理：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最有政治远见，最有斗争勇气，最有自我牺牲精神，最坚定，最勇敢，最正直，最聪明，什么样的困难都能克服，什么样的敌人都可以战胜，什么样的人间奇迹都可以创造出来。
    中国人民解放军，是毛主席亲手缔造的新型人民军队，是一支久经考验的、非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的英雄队伍，是一所学习毛泽东思想的大学校。在这所学校里，已经培养出了大批的英雄模范人物，刘英俊同志是其中的又一个杰出代表。现在，全国人民都在大学解放军。我们都要象解放军那样，热烈响应林彪同志的号召，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，把各行各业都办成学习毛泽东思想的大学校，培养出千千万万无产阶级革命事业接班人，培养出刘英俊式的、共产主义的一代新人。这是中国革命的希望所在，世界革命的希望所在。
    刘英俊同志光辉事迹的出现，必将对人们精神面貌和革命事业，发生巨大的深远的影响。我们所有同志，都应当向他学习，东北地区的党政军民，应当学得更好。青年一代应当向他学习，我们老同志也应当向他学习。在我们的时代里，不论职位高低，资历长短，只要他毛泽东思想红旗举得高，毛主席著作学得好，用得好，他就是我们学习的榜样。当前，国内外阶级斗争是十分尖锐复杂的。国际上“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激”；在国内，一场触及人们灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命，正在深入发展。我们应当广泛深入地开展向刘英俊同志学习的活动，进一步落实突出政治，更好地掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，进一步促进人们的思想革命化，更好地推动无产阶级文化大革命和三大革命运动，使我们的党、我们的国家和我们的军队，在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争中，作出新的贡献。
    让我们在毛泽东的伟大旗帜下，昂首阔步前进！
