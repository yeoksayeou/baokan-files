Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman on July 3 condemned the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and expressed firm support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S.

He said, "This aggressive bombing is the greatest insult to the dignity of the people. The air raids on peaceful people should be condemned by the whole world."

He called on all progressive countries in the world to take a firm stand against this act of aggression. He said, "To keep silent about the aggressive acts will only encourage the aggressors to interfere with many other countries that do not want to submit to U.S. policies and desire to build their own lives. He pointed out that the people will not kneel before the aggressors. The U.S. aggression has been condemned by the people of the world, including the American people. No force can make the people give up their struggle to create a new life."

    他说，这种侵略性的轰炸是对人民尊严的最大侮辱。空袭和平人民的行径应该遭到全世界的谴责。
    他要求全世界进步国家对这种侵略行径采取坚决的态度。他说，对侵略行径保持沉默，将会助长侵略者干涉许多不肯屈从美国的政策而渴望建设他们自己的生活的其他国家。他指出，人民不会在侵略者面前屈膝。美国的侵略已经遭到包括美国人民在内的世界人民的谴责。任何力量也不能使人民放弃他们为创造新生活而进行的斗争。
