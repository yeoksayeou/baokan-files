On the night of the 13th, the fifth strong typhoon made landfall at the Pearl River Estuary and moved towards the Zhaoqing region, gradually weakening. The average wind speed in the areas the typhoon's center passed through was ten levels, with gusts reaching eleven to twelve levels, and it brought more than one hundred millimeters of heavy rain. In the Pearl River Delta, over forty thousand people from the Foshan region mobilized to bravely fight against the typhoon and heavy rain, significantly reducing the damage caused by the disaster. This victory in fighting against the typhoon attack fully demonstrates that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fearless.

On the delta, the broad masses of cadres and people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have this time waged a resolute struggle against the typhoon. Zhuhai, Zhongshan, and Panyu counties, upon receiving the typhoon news, sent leading cadres of various levels of party committees to key areas to organize and lead the people in defense. The organs, schools, and factories of Zhongshan County dispatched more than four thousand five hundred people to the front lines of the anti-typhoon struggle, supporting farmers in anti-typhoon harvesting. Many places' cadres, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings on caring for the people's lives, braved the wind and rain to check every house for dangerous buildings, and promptly relocated people living in dangerous buildings to safe areas. All the dikes and embankments over one thousand acres in the region are safe and sound.

Currently, the typhoon has passed, and various places are urgently rescuing crops and conducting post-disaster relief work, creating favorable conditions for late-season production.

　　台风暴雨只等闲
　　佛山专区四十万人英勇战胜灾害
    据新华社广州十八日电　十三日晚间，第五号强台风在珠江口登陆，掠过珠江三角洲向肇庆专区方向前进，风力逐渐减弱。台风中心经过地区平均风力十级，阵风十一至十二级，并带来一百毫米以上的暴雨。珠江三角洲上的佛山专区各县出动了四十多万人，奋力抗击台风暴雨，大大减轻了灾害带来的损失。这次抗击台风袭击的胜利充分说明，毛泽东思想武装起来的人是无所畏惧的。
    三角洲上，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大干部群众，这次和台风展开了坚决斗争。珠海、中山、番禺等县在获悉台风消息后，各级党委领导干部亲自赶往重点地区，组织领导群众进行防御。中山县的机关、学校、工厂出动了四千五百多人，分赴抗风斗争最前线，支援农民抗风抢割。许多地方的干部牢记毛主席关心群众生活的教导，冒着风雨逐家逐户检查危房，及时把住在危房中的群众转移到安全地区。全区千亩以上的堤围都安全无恙。
    目前台风已过，各地正大力抢救作物和进行善后工作，为晚造生产创造有利的条件。
