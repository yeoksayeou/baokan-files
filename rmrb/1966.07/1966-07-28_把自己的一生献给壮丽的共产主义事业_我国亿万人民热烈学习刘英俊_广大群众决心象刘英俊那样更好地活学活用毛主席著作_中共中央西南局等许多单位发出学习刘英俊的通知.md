People's good son and Chairman Mao's good soldier, Comrade Liu Yingjun, whose brilliant deeds have moved, inspired, and educated hundreds of millions of people across the country. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are passionately pondering this question: Why do people live? How can one, like Liu Yingjun, fulfill the historical mission of the Chinese and world revolution?

The heroic deeds of Liu Yingjun began to be publicized on the 13th. In just a few short days, a movement to learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun swept across the nation. This learning movement, which began with the People's Liberation Army, an army that Chairman Mao personally created and which is extremely proletarian and combat-ready, quickly spread to every city and village, to the highlands of Tibet and the Kunlun Mountains. The momentum was fierce, the scale was vast, and the impact was profound, something rarely seen before. In these few days, many party organizations issued notices to learn from Liu Yingjun. Many factories, schools, and people's communes held report meetings, symposiums, and oath-taking rallies. Many urban streets were plastered with banners and posters to learn from heroes. Many units organized exhibitions of Liu Yingjun's life and deeds. The heroic achievements of the great communist warrior Liu Yingjun quickly became known to every household and deeply touched people's hearts. Broad masses of young people are learning, elderly people are learning, housewives are learning, and people from all walks of life are learning. Many old cadres in the Shenyang units of the People's Liberation Army, who have been in the revolution for 20 to 30 years, were so moved after learning about Liu Yingjun's deeds that they couldn't sleep at night. In the dead of night, they put on their old glasses, tears in their eyes, and wrote one after another learning notes. They said: It's great! It's timely! In the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, in the tumultuous Cultural Revolution, and in the face of the U.S. imperialists' escalation of the war in Vietnam, having such a brilliant example gives us a living model and boundless strength.

Why can a 21-year-old youth create so many miracles? Why does he have such a sublime spiritual realm? People unanimously say while learning from Liu Yingjun's deeds: All things grow with the sun, and revolutionary warriors grow with Mao Zedong Thought. Liu Yingjun became a hero of the Mao Zedong era because he truly did what Chairman Mao's book said, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming a good soldier of Chairman Mao. Liu Yingjun took Chairman Mao's book as the guiding direction for all his actions, striving to learn Mao Zedong Thought, faithfully implementing Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought. His thoughts and actions have become the wish and learning example of hundreds of millions of people.

The broad revolutionary masses, who are charging ahead in the Cultural Revolution, have learned from Liu Yingjun's deeds and have even more ardent fighting spirit. Everyone is determined to be like Liu Yingjun and become the vanguard of the cultural revolution. A group of Nanjing University students, who, with the spirit of "daring to pull the emperor off his horse" as taught by Chairman Mao, resolutely fought against the black gang member Kuang Yaming, said excitedly at the meeting: Liu Yingjun's firm stance and clear hatred in class struggle, his revolutionary spirit of bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought, have given us encouragement and strength. We will definitely follow in his footsteps and advance.

In recent days, they have studied Chairman Mao's works even more diligently in the struggle, criticized all ghosts and snakes even more bravely, and pushed the Cultural Revolution to a deeper and broader stage. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, after learning from Liu Yingjun's deeds of bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought, have an even stronger fighting will. Not only do they continue to deeply criticize the representatives of the bourgeoisie in their own units, but they also hold meetings to angrily criticize the black gang leaders in the literary and artistic circles such as Zhou Yang and their revisionist fallacies. In Jiamusi City, where Liu Yingjun bravely sacrificed himself, the revolutionary masses' activities of publicly denouncing all ghosts and snakes have reached a climax. A textile worker, Wang Jinhua, who only finished primary school, while speeding up production, wrote six articles that were published in newspapers and journals to counter the arrogant attacks of anti-party and anti-socialist elements. Some housewives in Jixi Commune, inspired by Liu Yingjun, also picked up their pens to fiercely attack the anti-party black gang. Recently, they wrote more than 30 critical articles, which were published on the blackboard newspapers and wall newspapers of the neighborhood committees.

The workers and commune members who are working hard on the production and construction front to strive for dual victories in revolution and construction have been learning Liu Yingjun's deeds over these days, their hearts extremely unsettled. They unanimously say: Liu Yingjun is worth learning from in every way, but of all the lessons, learning from him to study and apply Chairman Mao's works is the first. In many industrial and mining enterprises, workers take Liu Yingjun as a mirror, constantly examining and revising their plans to study Chairman Mao's works, determined to push the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new height. A worker from the Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory, Xiong Xiuqiong, the younger sister of the martyr Xiong Xiuhua, compared herself with Liu Yingjun's deeds and seriously summarized her experience of studying Chairman Mao's works. She said: "I will be like Liu Yingjun, taking Chairman Mao's book as the guiding direction for all my actions, reading Chairman Mao's book for a lifetime, doing revolution for a lifetime, and becoming a self-aware proletarian revolutionary warrior." In the vast countryside, a new high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works has risen. After learning from Liu Yingjun's deeds, many people carry Chairman Mao's book and Chairman Mao's quotation board to the fields, studying during rest times. Many cultural rooms and clubs have become strongholds for spreading Mao Zedong Thought, with people coming and going to read Chairman Mao's book. In Liu Yingjun's hometown, the New Morning Farm in Changchun City, the commune members do everything according to Chairman Mao's instructions, actively break private interests and establish public interests, and turn their hearts towards the collective. Even the youth who are not content to stay in the countryside have made up their minds to work on the agricultural front for a lifetime. Poor peasant commune member Guo Shuxian, in order to use Chairman Mao's book to educate her descendants, studies Chairman Mao's works even more enthusiastically. She herself is illiterate, so she has her son read; she doesn't understand, so she has her son explain; she doesn't know how to take notes, so she has her son write down her thoughts. On the border, people of all ethnic groups also take Liu Yingjun as an example and study Chairman Mao's works even more diligently. A Tibetan peasant from Nangjin Village on the eastern outskirts of Lhasa City, Pengcuo, who was born a slave, said: Learning from Liu Yingjun means learning Chairman Mao's book well. Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun shining on the snow mountains, illuminating the hearts of millions of emancipated peasants. With Mao Zedong Thought, we have boundless strength, can overcome all difficulties, create miracles on earth, and achieve revolutionary and productive bumper harvests year after year.

In the People's Liberation Army, Liu Yingjun's proletarian worldview of "living for the people and dying for the people" has moved the hearts of the broad masses of officers and soldiers. Liu Yingjun wrote in his diary that the class enemy "hopes to pin their hopes for a counter-revolutionary restoration on the degeneration of the younger generation. Individualist thoughts are precisely the loophole they want to exploit." This sentence has become a motto for the officers and soldiers. The officers and soldiers of a certain communication company discussed this sentence and said: The residual bourgeois thoughts and selfish desires in our minds are precisely the targets and impact points of "sugar-coated bullets." The officers and soldiers compare the struggle against bourgeois thoughts in their minds to a small battlefield and the struggle against class enemies to a large battlefield. They say: Revolutionary warriors can only ensure the annihilation of all enemies on the large battlefield if they win on the small battlefield. A certain medical orderly, Li Bingyan, after learning from Liu Yingjun, fiercely struggles against the bourgeois thoughts in his mind. He said: "Thought reform, if the old roots are not thoroughly uprooted and new shoots are not planted, is not possible. Grafting apricots on a plum tree will always bear fruits with a plum flavor. If the bourgeois worldview is not thoroughly broken, the proletarian worldview cannot be established." In many leading cadres, they also take Liu Yingjun as an example, consciously break private interests and establish public interests, reform their thoughts, and are determined to work, study, and reform until old age, forever preserving revolutionary youth.

Activities to enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, like Liu Yingjun, are rapidly unfolding across the country. Workers, peasants, and soldiers are eager to become propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and students are actively spreading Mao Zedong Thought, and commercial workers are using their counters as venues to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Broad revolutionary literary and art workers are even more full of vigor these days. Inspired by Liu Yingjun's revolutionary spirit, they have written and rehearsed a large number of literary and art programs that sing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary heroes, determined to plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on all cultural fronts.

A broad mass movement to learn from Liu Yingjun is deepening, inspiring people to better study Chairman Mao's works, more consciously transform their worldviews, achieve ideological transformation, and do all revolutionary work well.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the West South Bureau, the Beijing Municipal Committee, and the leading organs of some units of the People's Liberation Army recently issued notices calling for a widespread and in-depth campaign to learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun.

The notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the West South Bureau, requires all regions, departments, and units to, through the campaign to learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun, push the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. It requires all revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, in the three great revolutionary movements, especially in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to fiercely attack all anti-party and anti-socialist ghosts and snakes, to resolutely fight against all distortions, slanders, and oppositions to Mao Zedong Thought, to thoroughly eliminate the old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, to establish new thoughts, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat, to gradually achieve the ideological transformation of cadres and the masses, to make the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the entire region achieve even greater victories, and to make due contributions to supporting Vietnam and resisting America, and to supporting the world revolution.

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China requires the masses in its notice to, like Comrade Liu Yingjun, establish clear class and class struggle viewpoints, firm proletarian stances, and become thorough proletarian revolutionaries. In the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to display great revolutionary spirit, to charge ahead, to resolutely fight against those black gang members who are anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, to sweep away all ghosts and snakes, to thoroughly eliminate the poisoning of the revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

During this period, the following also issued notices to carry out the campaign to learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun: the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Autonomous Region Committees of the Communist Party of China in Xinjiang Uygur, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet. The leading organs of the Guangzhou and Jinan units of the People's Liberation Army, the Political Departments of the Xinjiang and Tibet Military Regions, and the Political Departments of the Hebei, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi Provincial Military Regions also issued notices respectively.

In the past few days, the following have also issued notices to their subordinate units to learn from and publicize Comrade Liu Yingjun: the Political Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Foreign Affairs, the Political Department of the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, and the Political Departments of the Ministries of Metallurgy, Commerce, Public Security, First Machinery, Coal, Textile, Building Materials, Chemical, Health, Foreign Trade, Grain, and Materials Management, and the Political Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    把自己的一生献给壮丽的共产主义事业
    我国亿万人民热烈学习刘英俊
    广大群众决心象刘英俊那样更好地活学活用毛主席著作
    中共中央西南局等许多单位发出学习刘英俊的通知
    新华社二十七日讯　人民的好儿子、毛主席的好战士刘英俊同志的光辉事迹感动、激励和教育着全国亿万人民。广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，满怀激情地思考着这样一个问题：人为什么活着？怎样才能象刘英俊那样完成中国革命和世界革命的历史使命？
    刘英俊的英雄事迹是从十三日开始宣传的。短短的十几天，一个向刘英俊同志学习的活动迅速地席卷全国。这个学习活动从毛主席亲手缔造的非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的人民解放军开始，迅速遍及各个城市、乡村，遍及西藏高原、喀喇昆仑山区，来势之猛，规模之大，感人之深，是过去所少有的。在这十几天里，许多地方党组织发出了学习刘英俊的通知，许多工厂、学校、人民公社举行了报告会、座谈会、誓师大会，许多城镇街头张贴了学英雄的标语和宣传画，许多单位举办了英雄生平事迹展览。伟大的共产主义战士刘英俊的英雄业绩，一时家喻户晓，深入人心。广大青少年在学，老年人在学，家庭妇女在学，各行各业的人都在学。人民解放军沈阳部队许多参加革命二三十年的老干部学了刘英俊事迹以后，感动得彻夜难眠。他们在深夜里戴起老花眼镜，含着泪花，写下一篇又一篇学习心得笔记。他们说：太好了！太及时了！在活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动中，在轰轰烈烈的文化大革命中，在美帝国主义加紧扩大越南战争的形势下，有了这样光辉的形象，就有了活样板，就有了无穷的力量。
    一个二十一岁的青年为什么能创造这么多奇迹？有这么崇高的精神境界？人们在学习刘英俊事迹时异口同声地说：万物生长靠太阳，革命战士成长靠毛泽东思想。刘英俊所以能成为毛泽东时代的英雄，就是因为他真正做到了读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。刘英俊把毛主席的书当作一切行动的指导方向，努力学习毛泽东思想，忠实贯彻毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想的思想和行为，已经成了亿万人民的心愿和学习榜样。
    正在文化大革命中冲锋陷阵的广大革命群众，学习了刘英俊事迹，斗志更加昂扬，人人决心象刘英俊那样，做文化革命的尖兵。曾经以毛主席的教导“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏精神，向黑帮分子匡亚明坚决斗争的一批南京大学学生，激动地在会上说：刘英俊在阶级斗争中立场坚定、爱憎分明，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想的革命精神给了我们鼓舞，给了我们力量，我们一定踏着他的脚印前进。　
    最近几天，他们更加努力地在斗争中学习毛主席著作，更加勇敢地批判一切牛鬼蛇神，把文化大革命推向了一个更深入、更广泛的阶段。广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，学了刘英俊英勇不屈捍卫毛泽东思想的事迹，战斗意志更加坚强，不仅继续深入批判本单位的资产阶级代表人物，而且纷纷集会，愤怒批判文艺界黑帮头子周扬等修正主义谬论。在刘英俊英勇献身的佳木斯市，革命群众口诛笔伐一切牛鬼蛇神的活动进入了高潮，只念过小学的纺织工人王进华，一面加紧生产，一面写了六篇文章刊登在报刊上，回击反党反社会主义分子的猖狂进攻。佳西公社的一些家庭妇女在刘英俊的激励下，也拿起笔杆向反党黑帮猛烈开火。最近，她们写了三十多篇批判文章，刊登在街道居民委员会的黑板报和墙报上。
    正在生产建设战线上为争取革命、建设双胜利而加紧工作的工人和公社社员，这些天，心情极不平静地一遍又一遍学习刘英俊的事迹，他们异口同声说：刘英俊处处值得我们学习，但千条万条，学习他活学活用毛主席著作是第一条。在许多工矿企业里，工人们把刘英俊当镜子，不断检查自己，修订自己学习毛主席著作的计划，决心把活学活用毛主席著作运动推向一个新的高潮。广州化学试剂厂工人、向秀丽烈士的妹妹向秀琼，对照着刘英俊事迹，认真地总结了自己学习毛主席著作的经验，她说：“我要象刘英俊那样把毛主席的书当作一切行动的指导方向，象他那样读一辈子毛主席的书，干一辈子革命，做一个自觉的无产阶级革命战士。”在广大农村，一个学习毛主席著作新高潮兴起了。许多人学了刘英俊事迹后，揣着毛主席的书，扛着毛主席语录板下田，休息时就学，许多文化室、俱乐部成了传播毛泽东思想的阵地，人们络绎不绝地来读毛主席的书。在刘英俊家乡长春市新晨农场，社员们处处照毛主席指示办事，积极破私立公，心向集体，不安心在农村的青年也下定决心在农业战线上干一辈子。贫农社员郭淑琴为了用毛主席的书教育后代，学习毛主席著作更积极了，自己不识字，叫儿子念；听不懂，叫儿子讲；不会记笔记，就叫儿子代写心得体会。在边疆，各族人民也都以刘英俊为榜样，更加勤奋地活学活用毛主席著作。拉萨市东郊纳金乡奴隶出身的藏族农民彭措说：学习刘英俊就要学好毛主席的书。毛泽东思想是照在雪山上的红太阳，照亮了百万翻身农奴的心，我们有了毛泽东思想，就有了无比的力量，就能战胜一切困难，创造人间奇迹，取得革命、生产年年丰收。
    在人民解放军中，刘英俊的“生为人民生、死为人民死”的无产阶级世界观，激动着广大指战员的心。刘英俊在日记上说，阶级敌人“企图把反革命复辟的希望寄托在年青一代的变质上。而个人主义思想正是他要利用的一个缺口。”这句话成了指战员们的格言。某部通信连的干部战士在讨论这句话时说：我们头脑中残存的资产阶级思想和私心杂念，正是“糖衣炮弹”的靶子和弹着点。指战员们把头脑中兴无灭资的斗争比作小战场，把同阶级敌人斗争比作大战场。他们说：革命战士只有在小战场上打了胜仗，才能保证在大战场上消灭任何敌人。某部卫生员李炳彦学习刘英俊以后，狠斗头脑里的资产阶级思想，他说：“思想改造，不彻底挖出旧根，栽上新苗是不行的。嫁接在李树上的杏，结出来的果总带有李味，不彻底破资产阶级世界观，就不能树立无产阶级世界观。”在许多领导干部中，也都以刘英俊为榜样，自觉地破私立公，改造思想，决心干到老，学到老，改造到老，永葆革命青春。
    象刘英俊那样热情宣传毛泽东思想的活动，也在全国各地迅速展开。工农兵群众争着当毛泽东思想宣传员，革命干部、革命知识分子和学生们积极传播毛泽东思想，商业工作者也以柜台作场地，向顾客宣传毛泽东思想。广大革命文艺工作者这几天更是意气风发，他们在刘英俊的革命精神鼓舞下，编写和排练了大批歌颂毛泽东思想、歌颂革命英雄的文艺节目，决心把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插向一切文化阵地。
    一个广大群众性的向刘英俊学习的活动在深入发展，它正在激励着人们更好地学习毛主席著作，更自觉地改造世界观，实现思想革命化，做好一切革命工作。
    据新华社讯　中共中央西南局、中共北京市委等单位和人民解放军一些部队领导机关最近分别发出通知，号召广泛深入地开展向刘英俊同志学习的活动。
