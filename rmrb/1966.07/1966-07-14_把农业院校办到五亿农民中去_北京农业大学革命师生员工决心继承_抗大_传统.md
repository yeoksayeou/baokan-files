Dear Party Central Committee, Respected Chairman Mao:

The letter from the seven revolutionary pioneers of Renmin University has deeply moved us. They have expressed our revolutionary faculty, students, and staff's boundless loyalty and love for the Party Central Committee and our most beloved leader Chairman Mao; they have expressed our profound hatred for the evil old educational system.

For a long time, the shackles of the old educational system have tightly bound us, making us severely detached from politics, from workers and peasants, and from reality. In schools ruled by bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities," we have been fed bourgeois and revisionist poison for years, severely corrupting the younger generation. This completely contradicts the Party's educational policies and Chairman Mao's instructions on all-around development of morality, intelligence, and physique.

Dear Party Central Committee, Respected Chairman Mao! You have shown us the correct path of half-work, half-study, and going to the countryside and returning to the countryside. We resolutely follow your words and instructions. However, these bourgeois "gentlemen" have used every possible means and found various "reasons" to strongly oppose this, making us extremely indignant. We must learn from the daring, outspoken, and revolutionary spirit of the seven students of Renmin University to thoroughly smash the old educational system! Dear Party Central Committee, Respected Chairman Mao!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which you personally initiated and led, is sweeping away the rotten old educational system with the force of a thunderbolt. The era of bourgeois "authorities" and "scholars" ruling our schools is gone forever. We must carry this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, establish a brand-new proletarian educational system in the agricultural university, inherit the traditions of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, carry forward the spirit of Yan'an, and make the agricultural university a true revolutionary melting pot to cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

To this end, we strongly demand:

1. Agricultural colleges must use Chairman Mao's works as textbooks, make class struggle the main course, and send all faculty and students to the three great revolutionary struggles to temper and transform themselves, achieving the revolutionization and laborization of intellectuals.

2. Upon the conclusion of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, immediately implement half-work, half-study and going to the countryside and returning to the countryside in all agricultural colleges. Resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions that agricultural colleges should be established in rural areas, go to the five hundred million peasants, go to the countryside, go to the mountains, go to the pastoral areas, go to the most difficult places! Live with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, learn from them, summarize and learn from their experiences in production struggles, and blaze a new trail in agricultural education.

3. The school should first open its doors to workers and peasants, selecting outstanding individuals from workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and demobilized soldiers to enroll.

4. Resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions to focus on study while also engaging in other activities; resolutely shorten the school term for agricultural colleges to two or three years; resolutely eliminate all specialized courses and subjects that are detached from production and reality.

5. Thoroughly reform the teaching staff, abolish the bourgeois academic titles of professor, associate professor, lecturer, and assistant lecturer, and abolish the bourgeois system of recruiting and training graduate students.

Dear Party Central Committee, Respected Chairman Mao!

It is you who have nurtured us, and it is you who have shown us the way forward. We, the revolutionary faculty, students, and staff of the entire school, will not disappoint your expectations, will forever be loyal to you, and will pass on and carry forward the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought! We are determined to forever follow the Party, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, be good soldiers and students of Chairman Mao, be the vanguard of the educational revolution, walk the revolutionary path of integrating with workers and peasants, and shoulder the great mission bestowed by the times!

Long live our most, most respected great revolutionary leader Chairman Mao!

All revolutionary faculty, students, and staff of Beijing Agricultural University

    把农业院校办到五亿农民中去
    北京农业大学革命师生员工决心继承“抗大”传统亲爱的党中央，敬爱的毛主席：
    中国人民大学七位革命闯将给您的信，使我们万分感动。他们表达了我们革命师生员工对党中央和最敬爱的领袖毛主席的无限忠诚和热爱；表达了我们对万恶的旧教育制度的无比憎恨。
    长期以来，旧教育制度的枷锁紧紧地束缚着我们，使我们严重地脱离政治，脱离工农，脱离实际。在资产阶级“学者”、“权威”统治下的学校，长年累月向我们灌输的都是资产阶级和修正主义的毒素，严重地摧残着年青一代。这就完全违背了党的教育方针，违背了毛主席关于德、智、体全面发展的指示。
    亲爱的党中央，敬爱的毛主席！您给我们指出了半农半读、社来社去的正确方向，我们坚决听您的话，照您的指示去做。但是这班资产阶级“老爷”们却千方百计、找出种种
  “理由”极力反对，使我们气愤万分。我们一定要学习中国人民大学七位同学敢想、敢说、敢闯的大无畏革命精神，彻底砸碎旧的教育制度！亲爱的党中央，敬爱的毛主席！
    由您直接发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，正以雷霆万钧之势，冲击腐朽的旧教育制度。资产阶级“权威”、“学者”统治我们学校的时代一去不复返了。我们一定要把目前这场无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，在农业大学建立起崭新的无产阶级教育制度，继承“抗大”传统，发扬南泥湾精神，使农业大学成为真正的革命大熔炉，培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    为此，我们强烈要求：
    一、农业院校一定要以毛主席著作为教材，以阶级斗争为主课，让全体师生到三大革命斗争中去锻炼改造，实现知识分子革命化、劳动化。
    二、这次无产阶级文化大革命一结束，立即在农业院校全部实行半农半读和社来社去。坚决贯彻毛主席农业院校应办到农村去的指示，到五亿农民中去，到农村去，到山区去，到牧区去，到最艰苦的地方去！和广大贫下中农生活在一起，拜他们为师，在生产斗争中总结、学习群众经验，在农业教育上闯出一条中国自己的道路。
    三、学校首先向工农开门，选拔工人、贫下中农和复员军人中的优秀分子入学。
    四、坚决贯彻毛主席以学为主、兼搞别样的指示；坚决要求将农业院校的学制缩短为二、三年；坚决砍掉一切脱离生产、脱离实际的专业和课程。
    五、彻底改造教师队伍，废除教授、副教授、讲师、助教等资产阶级的学衔等级制度，废除资产阶级的研究生招收和培养制度。亲爱的党中央，敬爱的毛主席！
    是您抚育了我们，是您给我们指明了前进的方向。我们全校革命的师生员工决不辜负您的希望，永远忠实于您，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗接过来，传下去！我们决心永远跟着党走，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士、好学生，做教育革命的尖兵，走与工农相结合的革命道路，担负起时代赋予我们的伟大重任！
    祝我们最最敬爱的伟大革命导师毛主席万寿无疆！
    北京农业大学
      全体革命师生员工
