The People's Good Son

The people's good son Liu Yingjun has given his young life for the people. His heroic deeds have moved us, inspired us, educated us, and prompted us to reflect on everything.

Although Liu Yingjun has sacrificed himself, like the great communist warrior Lei Feng and other heroes, his spirit of serving the people will forever live in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people and in the cause of communism for generations to come.

Why do people live? For thousands of years, different classes have had different answers.

For the feudal class, the purpose of life is to buy land, seek official positions, enrich the family, and pass on wealth to descendants.

For the bourgeoisie, money is everything, and the individual comes first. They have stripped away the feudal class's pretenses of propriety, morality, and shame, turning human relationships into naked financial transactions.

All exploiting classes build their lives and happiness on the blood, tears, and bones of the laboring people.

The proletarian revolution is a revolution to eliminate all systems of exploitation and all exploiting classes. It is a thorough revolution to eradicate all the old ideas, cultures, customs, and habits that poison the people and are based on the system of exploitation. In our view as proletarians and Communist Party members, the greatest meaning of life is to dedicate one's entire life to the cause of the proletarian revolution, to invest one's limited life in the boundless and brilliant cause of communism. Our proletarian revolutionary worldview is something that all exploiting classes and all individualists cannot understand. Our lofty spiritual realm is unparalleled by any heroes in history.

Comrade Mao Zedong often teaches us to learn from Comrade White (Norman Bethune)'s spirit of selflessness and dedication to others. He said: "A person's ability may be great or small, but as long as they have this spirit, they are a noble person, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person who has risen above petty interests, and a person who benefits the people."

This spirit is to serve the people wholeheartedly.

This spirit is to dedicate oneself to the needs of the communist cause, to work tirelessly and selflessly for a lifetime, to seek neither fame nor wealth, to be content with being a small screw, and to be an ordinary soldier in the people's revolutionary cause.

This spirit is to endure hardship and face death for the people and the revolution. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, to die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai.

Whoever has this spirit can withstand all the trials of class struggle and revolutionary war, and endure all kinds of hardships.

In the midst of gunfire and bullets in the people's revolutionary war, one can become Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Sima Yimaiti, Luo Guangxian, or Mai Xiande.

In the face of the enemy's guillotine and tiger bench, one can become Liu Huilan or Jiang Jie.

In moments of urgent danger, one can become Xiang Xiuli, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, or Liu Yingjun.

In the face of intense work and fatal illnesses, one can become Jiao Yulu.

In everyday, ordinary work, one can become Lei Feng and figures like Lei Feng.

The revolutionary spirit of these heroes comes from the great people and from the great thought of Mao Zedong.

Comrade Mao Zedong often teaches us that every Communist Party member, regardless of seniority or position, must consider themselves a son of the people and sincerely serve as a servant of the people. The late comrade Liu Yingjun was such a good son of the people and a good servant of the people.

The great thought of Mao Zedong has nurtured the broad masses of revolutionary fighters in various revolutionary periods in our country, and is nurturing and will continue to nurture our young generation. Comrade Mao Zedong often exhorts the older generation of revolutionaries to carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions, to maintain close ties with the masses, and to preserve proletarian integrity. He calls on the youth to brave the storms and hardships, to temper themselves in battle, and to become successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. The socialist education movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, are cultivating a new generation of communist spirit. A magnificent scene of "six billion people all becoming sages" has already appeared on the land of our country.

People can see that the great thought of Mao Zedong is being widely popularized in China, penetrating deeply into the souls of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is another earth-shaking event. Our billion laboring people armed with the thought of Mao Zedong—this is the invincible power of our great motherland. The ideological transformation of the broad masses of our country—this is the powerful driving force for our great communist cause to forge ahead against the waves.

Now is the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is advancing to victory worldwide. Today's and tomorrow's Liu Yingjuns, these good sons of the people, will surely and definitely fulfill their historical mission.

Long live Comrade Liu Yingjun, the people's good son!

    人民的好儿子
    人民的好儿子刘英俊，为人民付出了他年轻的生命。他的英雄事迹，感动着我们，激励着我们，教育着我们，推动着我们去思考一切。
    刘英俊虽然牺牲了，但是，跟伟大的共产主义战士雷锋等英雄人物一样，他为人民服务的崇高精神，永远活在亿万人们心里，永远活在千秋万代的共产主义事业中。
    人为什么活着？几千年来，各个阶级有不同的答案。
    买田置地，升官发财，光宗耀祖，封妻荫子，是封建阶级的人生哲学。
    资产阶级是金钱万能，个人第一。它把封建阶级的礼义廉耻的伪装撕得一干二净，把人和人之间的关系统统变成赤裸裸的金钱关系。
    一切剥削阶级，都把自己的生活和幸福建筑在劳动人民的血泪和尸骨之上。
    无产阶级革命，是消灭一切剥削制度、消灭一切剥削阶级的革命，是彻底破除建筑在剥削制度基础之上的一切毒害人民的旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯的革命。在我们无产阶级和共产党员看来，人活着的最大意义，就在于把自己的一生最大限度地贡献给无产阶级革命事业，把自己有限的生命，投入到无限光辉灿烂的共产主义事业中去。我们这种无产阶级的革命世界观，是一切剥削阶级、一切个人利己主义者根本无法理解的。我们这种崇高的精神境界，是历史上一切英雄豪杰无法比拟的。
    毛泽东同志经常教育我们，要学习白求恩同志毫不利己、专门利人的精神。他说：“一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”
    这种精神，就是全心全意为人民服务。
    这种精神，就是为了共产主义事业的需要，一辈子埋头工作，任劳任怨，不求名，不为利，安于当螺丝钉，安于做人民革命事业的普通一兵。
    这种精神，就是为人民，为革命，不怕苦，也不怕死。正如毛泽东同志所说的，为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重。
    谁有了这样的精神，谁就能够经受一切严峻的阶级斗争和革命战争的考验，经受各种艰难困苦的考验。
    在人民革命战争的枪林弹雨中，就可以成为董存瑞、黄继光、司马义买买提、罗光燮、麦贤得。
    在敌人的铡刀、老虎凳前面，就可以成为刘胡兰、江竹筠。
    在紧急的危险关头，就可以成为向秀丽、欧阳海、王杰、刘英俊。
    在紧张的工作和致命的疾病面前，就可以成为焦裕禄。
    在日常的平凡工作中，就可以成为雷锋和雷锋式的人物。
    英雄们的这种革命精神，来源于伟大的人民，来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。
    毛泽东同志经常教育我们，任何一个共产党员，不论资格大小，职位高低，都必须把自己看成是人民的儿子，老老实实地，诚诚恳恳地，当人民的勤务员。不久以前牺牲了的刘英俊同志，就是这样的一个人民的好儿子，人民的好勤务员。
    毛泽东思想哺育了我国各个革命时期的广大的革命战士，哺育了和正在哺育着我们年青的一代。毛泽东同志经常勉励老一辈的革命者，要发扬革命的光荣传统，密切联系群众，保持无产阶级晚节。他号召青年们要经风雨，见世面，在战斗中，锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的社会主义教育运动和无产阶级文化大革命，正在培养共产主义的一代新风。一个“六亿神州尽舜尧”的宏伟景象，已经出现在我国大地上。
    人们可以看到，伟大的毛泽东思想正在中国最广泛地普及开来，深入到广大工农兵群众的灵魂深处。这是又一件翻天覆地的大事。我国亿万劳动人民用毛泽东思想武装起来，这就是我们伟大祖国不可战胜的力量。我国广大群众的思想革命化，这就成为我们伟大共产主义事业破浪前进的强大动力。
    现在是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义在全世界走向胜利的时代，今天和明天的刘英俊们，这些人民的好儿子，一定要、也一定能够完成自己的历史使命。
    人民的好儿子刘英俊同志万岁！
