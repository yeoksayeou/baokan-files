    Thai representative Kura Jibali today said at the plenary session of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, "Once revolutionary people combine Mao Zedong Thought with their own country's revolutionary struggle, the revolutionary force will continuously grow and be invincible, ultimately achieving final victory."

    He first expressed complete support for the suggestion made by the Indonesian representative to hold the Third Asian and African Writers Conference in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, under the banner of revolutionary, proletarian internationalism.

    He strongly protested against the recent barbaric act of American bandits bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. He said, this is obviously a desperate and evil activity. The Asian and African Writers Movement will further unite and strengthen our forces, and more effectively strike at American imperialism and all the ghosts and snakes that collaborate with American imperialism.

    Kura Jibali enthusiastically praised the great Mao Zedong Thought in his speech. He said, the reason why socialist China and the Communist Party of China have become a great revolutionary force in the world is mainly because 700 million Chinese people are actively learning and applying the great Mao Zedong Thought—the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. He said, the Cultural Revolution currently underway in China has clearly shown that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it can become an immense and irresistible force. The glorious achievements of the Chinese people in the struggle for socialist revolution and socialist construction are all due to relying on Mao Zedong Thought. This is not only true for the Chinese people, but also for all oppressed peoples and nations around the world, including the Thai people who are currently fighting against American imperialism and its lackeys.

    When talking about China's Cultural Revolution, Kura Jibali said, this Cultural Revolution not only has great significance for China's socialist revolution but also for the socialist revolution of the entire socialist camp, for the national liberation and revolutionary movements of the peoples of Asia and Africa, for the class struggle of the peoples of the world, and for the struggle against modern revisionism.

    Kura Jibali condemned the aggressive crimes of American imperialism against Vietnam. He said, the brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation have greatly shaken the military and political foundations of the United States, exposing American imperialism as a paper tiger in front of the world. This struggle is a great contribution to the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries.

    Kura Jibali said, we Asian and African writers must thoroughly expose the bloodthirsty "peace talks" plot of American imperialism and firmly expose those political brokers, especially those Soviet revisionists who "act in concert" with American imperialism. He said, the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa have already clearly seen that the Soviet revisionists have exposed themselves as servants of American imperialism, betraying the interests and revolutionary achievements of the Vietnamese people. This is absolutely unacceptable to the revolutionary forces of Asia, Africa, and the world. We must smash all the political tricks of the Washington foxes and all the political tricks of the modern revisionists.

    He strongly opposed and condemned the split conference held in Cairo by the Soviet revisionists and fully supported the decision of the Asian and African Writers Permanent Bureau to declare that Soviet writers have permanently lost all rights and positions in the Asian and African Writers Permanent Bureau due to their own split activities. He pointed out that the conference held by the Soviet revisionists is purely in the interests of American imperialism, and therefore, it is a betrayal of the mission of Asian and African writers, a betrayal of the heroic Vietnamese people, and a betrayal of the peoples of Asia and Africa who are fighting to the death with American imperialism; it is an extremely despicable and shameful act that should be strongly condemned by Asian and African writers and peoples.

    Kura Jibali also condemned the aggression of American imperialism against Thailand. He said, currently, the consecutive victories of the patriotic armed forces of Thailand have made the Thai people clearly see that the people have power, and the patriotic armed struggle of the Thai people, which is rapidly developing, is a conscious and revolutionary political action of the Thai people. The patriotic forces of the Thai people will inevitably grow and strengthen. Now, the armed struggle of the Thai people has just begun, but the revolutionary people of Thailand have already made up their minds to carry out the armed struggle for national independence and people's freedom to the end.

    He finally expressed that the Thai people fully support, without any conditions, the political and armed struggles of the peoples of Asian, African, and Latin American countries against imperialism led by the United States. Patriotic and revolutionary Thai writers will closely unite with Asian and African friends to fight against imperialism led by the United States, oppose the cultural and literary arts invasion of the United States, and support the struggle against the counter-revolutionary and anti-people's interests of modern revisionist culture and literary arts.

    泰国代表古腊·柿巴立的发言
    新华社三日讯　泰国代表古腊·柿巴立今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，“当革命人民一旦把毛泽东思想和本国的革命斗争实际相结合，革命的力量就会不断地壮大和无往而不胜，直至取得最后胜利。”
    他在发言时首先表示完全支持印度尼西亚代表提出的，在高举革命的、无产阶级国际主义旗帜的中华人民共和国首都北京召开第三届亚非作家大会的建议。
    他在会上强烈抗议美国强盗最近轰炸河内和海防的野蛮罪行。他说，这显然是一种狗急跳墙的罪恶活动，亚非作家运动将更进一步团结和进一步加强我们的力量，更加狠狠地有效地打击美帝国主义以及同美帝国主义合伙的一切牛鬼蛇神。
    古腊·柿巴立在发言中热烈地赞扬了伟大的毛泽东思想。他说，现在社会主义的中国和中国共产党之所以成为世界伟大的革命力量，最主要的就是因为七亿中国人民活学活用伟大的毛泽东思想——当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。他说，这次中国进行的文化大革命已经清楚地表明，当毛泽东思想一旦被广大群众所掌握，便可以变成排山倒海的无比巨大的力量。中国人民在社会主义革命斗争和社会主义建设中所获得的辉煌成就，都是由于依靠毛泽东思想。这不仅对中国人民是如此，对于包括目前正在和美帝国主义及其走狗进行斗争的泰国人民在内的全世界被压迫民族和人民来说，也是如此和必将是如此。
    古腊·柿巴立在谈到中国的文化大革命时说，这场文化大革命，不仅对于中国的社会主义革命具有重大意义，而且对于整个社会主义阵营的社会主义革命，对于全世界人民特别是对亚非人民的民族解放运动和革命运动，对于全世界的阶级斗争，对于同现代修正主义的斗争，也具有重大意义。
    古腊·柿巴立谴责了美帝国主义对越南的侵略罪行。他说，越南人民的抗美救国斗争的光辉胜利，大大动摇了美国的军事和政治基础，使美帝国主义在全世界面前显现出纸老虎的原形。这一斗争是对各国人民的革命斗争的一种巨大的贡献。
    古腊·柿巴立说，我们亚非作家必须彻底揭露美帝国主义喝人血的“和谈”阴谋，并且坚决揭露那些政治掮客，特别是那些同美帝国主义“共同行动”的苏联修正主义者。他说，革命的亚非人民已经清楚地看到：苏联修正主义者已经自我暴露了他们是为美帝国主义服务的，他们出卖越南人民的利益和革命的成果，这是亚非和世界革命力量所绝对不能允许的。必须粉碎华盛顿狐狸般的各种政治骗局，必须粉碎现代修正主义者的各种政治骗局。
    他对苏联修正主义者在开罗召开分裂会议表示坚决反对和强烈的谴责，对亚非作家常设局宣布苏联作家由于他们自己从事分裂活动而永远丧失了在亚非作家常设局中的一切权利和地位，表示完全的支持。他指出，苏联召开分裂会议是纯粹为美帝国主义的利益服务的，因此，这是一种背叛亚非作家的使命、背叛英雄的越南人民、背叛正在和美帝国主义作你死我活的搏斗的亚非人民的行为；是一种应该受到亚非作家和人民强烈谴责的极端卑鄙无耻的行为。
    古腊·柿巴立还谴责了美帝国主义对泰国的侵略。他说，目前，泰国爱国武装力量接连取得的胜利，使泰国人民清楚地看到，人民是有力量的，正在迅速发展中的泰国人民的爱国武装斗争是泰国人民自觉地、革命地政治觉悟的行动。泰国人民的爱国力量必然日益成长和壮大。现在，泰国人民的武装斗争刚刚开始，但是泰国的革命人民已经下定决心，要把为了民族独立和人民自由的武装斗争进行到底。
    他最后表示，泰国人民对于亚非拉各国人民同美国为首的帝国主义进行着的包括政治的和武装的斗争，表示毫无条件的、完全的支持。爱国的、革命的泰国作家，将同亚非朋友紧密团结，对以美国为首的帝国主义进行斗争，反对美国的文化和文学艺术侵略，支持反对现代修正主义的反革命的和违背人民利益的文化和文学艺术的斗争。
