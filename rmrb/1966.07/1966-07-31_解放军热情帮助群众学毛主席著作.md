The PLA carries forward the glorious tradition of being both a fighting force and a work force, using Chairman Mao's works as the guiding direction for all tasks. While striving to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, they enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the people, helping the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. They have become an active propaganda team for spreading Mao Zedong Thought.

The PLA's activities to help the masses study and apply Chairman Mao's works were launched on the basis of significant achievements in their own active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and in strengthening revolutionary construction. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers, filled with boundless love, faith, and admiration for the Party and Chairman Mao, voluntarily regard the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental task of the army's mass work and their most glorious responsibility. Whether they are on missions outside or on the march, they spread Mao Zedong Thought wherever they go. They say, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao's works are the guiding direction for all our tasks. The more people master Mao Zedong Thought, the more revolutionary strength we have." "The army has a thousand and ten thousand tasks for the masses, helping the masses study Chairman Mao's works is the first task."

Recently, a certain chemical defense company of the Beijing Military Region conducted a long-distance field training exercise, passing through 32 counties and over 300 villages. Along the way, they placed the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work. They said, "Food can be forgotten, clothes can be forgotten, but the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought cannot be forgotten." During the march, they went to every village and introduced the experience of studying Chairman Mao's works to the villagers, helping them study Chairman Mao's works. The medical personnel propagated Mao Zedong Thought every time they treated a patient and attached a quotation from Chairman Mao to every packet of medicine they gave out, ensuring that "every village is seeded with red, every day is propaganda, marching thousands of miles, the line is unbroken." A certain company of the Guangzhou Military Region moved four times in four years. Wherever they moved, they helped the local people study Chairman Mao's works. They successively helped local factories, production teams, and schools establish 25 study groups, guidance stations, night schools, and cultural rooms, making 11 units advanced collectives in studying Chairman Mao's works. They also trained 95 study cadres for the local commune. The Shenyang, Nanjing, Jinan, and Kunming Military Regions, as well as some units of the Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet Military Districts, brought Chairman Mao's works to the fields and farmlands while helping the masses with labor. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a certain unit of the Lanzhou Military Region formed a soldier propaganda team, fearing neither high mountains nor long roads, walking dozens of miles every day to propagate the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to every household of poor and lower-middle peasants. The masses said, "Chairman Mao is our guide, and the PLA sent by Chairman Mao is our confidant."

In helping the masses study Chairman Mao's works, various units, based on their own experiences and the characteristics of rural areas, particularly emphasized using Chairman Mao's theories on class and class struggle to arm the minds of the community members. This enabled them to see clearly, stand firmly, and withstand the storms of class struggle. The "Red Vanguard Company" guarding the country's "Southern Gate" studied Chairman Mao's relevant theories on class and class struggle with the community members, greatly raising their awareness. Everyone regarded the border as the frontline of class struggle, actively participated in border defense, and turned the border into an iron wall, foiling the enemy's repeated sabotage activities. In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the officers and soldiers of a certain unit studied Chairman Mao's works with the local community members and repeatedly propagated the significance of the Cultural Revolution to them, propagating Chairman Mao's views on class and class struggle. This helped the community members understand the new situation and characteristics of class struggle, holding denunciation meetings and wall newspapers to criticize anti-Party and anti-socialist elements.

Chairman Mao taught us that changing one's worldview is a fundamental change. In helping the masses study Mao Zedong Thought, various units placed breaking private interests and establishing public interests, firmly grasping the transformation of worldviews, and promoting the thought revolution of the people at the forefront. They said: study must be focused on the key points, help must be given to the heart. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Air Force studied Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and other articles with the local party branch, discussing the topic "For whom do we till the land," guiding the community members to compare themselves with Zhang Zedong and Norman Bethune's selfless spirit. After studying, the community members' outlook on life underwent significant changes. Some said, "We cannot just look at what is under our noses when we till the land. We must learn from Norman Bethune's internationalist spirit, stand in the fields but look at the world, and connect tilling the land with the world revolution."

In helping the masses study, various units also paid attention to arming the masses with Chairman Mao's spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, helping them overcome natural disasters and change their backward appearance. The artillery battalion of a certain unit was stationed in an area with more dry fields and fewer paddy fields, both fearing drought and waterlogging. Some community members thought it was a poor place and that production could not be improved. The battalion sent three cadres to assist the brigade party branch in helping the community members study Chairman Mao's works, widely propagating the Dazhai experience, making the community members realize that to develop production, they must first have Dazhai's revolutionary spirit, daring to fight against heaven and earth, and create wealth for the country with their own hands. Thus, male and female community members, regardless of cold winds and scorching sun, persisted in treating mountains and water, fighting hard for a year, greatly changing the production situation, and significantly increasing grain production. Last year, when a certain regiment of the Fujian Frontline Forces moved to a new station, the local area was severely affected by drought, and some cadres and community members of the production team had a sense of difficulty. The regiment party committee immediately sent a group of political work cadres and active members of studying Chairman Mao's works to the masses, helping them study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," propagating Chairman Mao's teaching of "making a firm decision, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory" to the masses, inspiring the masses to learn from Dazhai people's spirit of fighting against heaven and earth to transform nature, and overcome disasters. With the help of the army, the masses' enthusiasm for disaster relief was quickly aroused. They dug wells and opened canals, saving the crops, overcoming the drought, and achieving a good harvest for the season. Seeing the bountiful fruits, the community members excitedly said: The PLA brought us the timely rain of Mao Zedong Thought, helping us overcome one difficulty after another and achieve victory.

    发扬人民军队既是战斗队又是工作队的光荣传统
    解放军热情帮助群众学毛主席著作
    用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述武装群众头脑，使他们在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，看得清、站得稳、顶得住；帮助群众破私立公，狠抓世界观的改造，促进人的思想革命化；教育群众敢于斗争，敢于胜利，战胜自然灾害，改变落后面貌。
    据新华社三十日讯　中国人民解放军发扬人民军队既是战斗队又是工作队的光荣传统，把毛主席的书作为各项工作的指导方向，在努力学习和运用毛泽东思想的同时，满腔热情地向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想，帮助群众活学活用毛主席著作，成为传播毛泽东思想的一支最活跃的宣传队。
    解放军帮助人民群众活学活用毛主席著作的活动，是在部队本身活学活用毛主席著作，加强革命化建设取得重大成就的基础上广泛展开的。广大指战员满怀对党和毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的感情，自觉地把宣传毛泽东思想列为部队群众工作的根本任务，作为自己最光荣的责任，不论外出执行任务，还是野营路上，走到哪里就把毛泽东思想传播到哪里。他们说：“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，毛主席的书是我们各项工作的指导方向，多一个群众掌握毛泽东思想，就多一分革命力量”，“军队做群众工作有千件万件，帮助群众学习毛主席著作是头一件。”不久前，北京部队某部防化连举行了一次长途野营训练，途经三十二个县，三百多个村庄，一路都把宣传毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位。他们说：“吃能忘、穿能忘，宣传毛泽东思想不能忘。”行军途中，他们走到哪村，就向哪村的群众介绍学习毛主席著作的经验，帮助哪村群众学习毛主席著作。卫生员给群众看一次病就宣传一次毛泽东思想，送一包药就附上一条毛主席语录，做到“村村撒红种，天天搞宣传，行军数千里，里里不断线”。广州部队某连四年移防四次，移驻到哪里就帮助哪里的群众学习毛主席著作，先后帮助驻地工厂、生产队、学校建立起二十五个学习毛主席著作小组、辅导站、夜校和文化室，使十一个单位成了学习毛主席著作先进集体，还为驻地公社培养了九十五名学习骨干。沈阳、南京、济南、昆明部队和新疆、内蒙古、西藏军区的一些部队，在帮助群众劳动中，还把毛主席著作带到田间、地头，帮助群众学习。兰州部队某部在无产阶级文化大革命中，组成战士宣传队，不怕山高路远，每天跋涉几十里，逐户向贫下中农社员宣传无产阶级文化大革命的重大意义。群众说：“毛主席是我们的领路人，毛主席派来的解放军是我们的知心人。”
    各部队在帮助群众学习毛主席著作中，根据自己的经验，针对农村的特点，特别重视用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述去武装社员的头脑，使他们在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，看得清、站得稳、顶得住。守卫祖国“南大门”的某部“红色前哨连”，和社员一起学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，大大提高了群众的觉悟，大家把边防看成阶级斗争的最前哨，积极参加边防斗争，使边防真正成为一道铜墙铁壁，粉碎了敌人一次又一次的阴谋破坏活动。某部指战员在无产阶级文化大革命初期，同驻地社员一起学习毛主席著作，反复向社员宣传文化大革命的意义，宣传毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的观点，使社员认清了当前阶级斗争的新形势、新特点，纷纷举行声讨会、出墙报，批判反党反社会主义黑帮。
    毛主席教导我们，世界观的转变是一个根本的转变。各部队在帮助群众学习毛泽东思想的过程中，都把破私立公，狠抓世界观改造，促进人民群众思想革命化摆在首位。他们说：学要学到点子上，帮要帮到心坎上。空军部队某部指战员同当地党支部研究，帮助社员学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章，并以“为谁种田”为题进行讨论，引导社员用张思德、白求恩毫不利己、专门利人的精神对照自己。经过学习，社员思想面貌起了很大变化。有的说：“我们种田不能只看眼皮底下，要学习白求恩同志的国际主义精神，身在田间，放眼世界，把种田和世界革命联系起来。”
    各部队在帮助群众学习中，还注意用毛主席敢于斗争，敢于胜利的精神武装群众，帮助群众战胜自然灾害，改变落后面貌。某部加农炮营驻地旱地多，水田少，既怕旱又怕涝，有些社员认为是个穷地方，生产没法上去。营里就派出三名干部协助大队党支部帮助群众学习毛主席著作，广泛宣传大寨经验，使社员认识到要发展生产，首先要有大寨人的革命精神，敢与天斗、与地斗，用自己的双手为国家创造财富。于是，男女社员不顾寒风烈日，坚持治山治水，苦战一年，大大改变了生产面貌，粮食大幅度增产。福建前线部队某团去年移防到新驻地时，当地旱灾严重，生产队有些干部、社员产生了畏难情绪。团党委马上派出一批政治工作干部和学习毛主席著作积极分子，深入群众，帮助他们学习《愚公移山》，向群众宣传毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，鼓舞群众学习大寨人斗天斗地改造自然的精神，去战胜灾害。在部队帮助下，很快调动了群众的抗灾的积极性，他们挖井开渠，把庄稼抢救过来，战胜了干旱，夺得了当季好收成。社员看了丰硕的果实，激动地说：解放军给我们送来了毛泽东思想的“及时雨”，使我们克服了一个又一个困难，夺得了胜利。
