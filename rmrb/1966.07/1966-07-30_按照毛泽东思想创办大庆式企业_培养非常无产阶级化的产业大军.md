More than a thousand enterprise leaders study the experience of ideological revolutionization in Daqing

To establish Daqing-style enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought and foster a highly proletarian industrial army.

Socialist enterprises are not only strongholds of socialist construction but more importantly, strongholds of socialist revolution. To emphasize politics and run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, it is necessary to take class struggle as the key link, grasp the three great revolutionary movements, and thoroughly eliminate the purely business-oriented viewpoint.

New China News Agency, July 29th - The first session of the Daqing Experience Study Class, jointly organized by the State Economic Commission, the Industrial and Transportation Political Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, has recently concluded. During the two-month study period, the students focused on studying the issue of emphasizing politics and running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought. They systematically criticized the purely business-oriented viewpoint, clarified the great strategic significance of emphasizing politics and running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, strengthened their awareness of class struggle, further invigorated their revolutionary spirit, and enhanced their confidence and determination to establish Daqing-style enterprises.

This session of the study class was held in Daqing. Participants included 1,200 leaders from 103 enterprises. Through visits, on-site study, listening to introductions on Daqing's experience, conducting debates on emphasizing politics, participating in the Cultural Revolution, and summarizing studies, they deeply realized that: emphasizing politics is to emphasize Mao Zedong Thought, to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything; emphasizing politics must be implemented in the ideological revolutionization of individuals; to emphasize politics and run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, it is necessary to firmly establish the viewpoint of class struggle, take class struggle as the key link, grasp the three great revolutionary movements, and thoroughly eliminate the purely business-oriented viewpoint.

After systematically criticizing the purely business-oriented viewpoint, the students further clarified that socialist enterprises are not only strongholds of socialist construction but more importantly, strongholds of socialist revolution; the task of enterprises is not only to produce products but more importantly, to foster a highly proletarian, revolutionary, combat-ready, and modernized industrial army, turning enterprises into grand schools of Mao Zedong Thought; running enterprises cannot rely on coercive orders or material incentives, but must rely on strengthening political and ideological work, arming people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought, raising people's class consciousness, fully unleashing their initiative and creativity, and transforming them into a great material force; it is necessary to rely on the broad masses of workers to run enterprises, thoroughly overthrow the "experts" and "authorities" that oppress the masses, and thoroughly eliminate the "foreign frameworks" and "old frameworks" that shackle the masses' initiative; it is necessary to ensure the Party's absolute leadership over enterprises, with enterprise leaders prioritizing political leadership, seriously implementing democratic centralism, further clarifying the situation of class struggle at home and abroad, especially within enterprises, recognizing that the main contradiction within enterprises is the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between two classes and two roads, and strengthening the awareness of class struggle.

Through the study, the students were tempered in this revolutionary furnace of Daqing, raised their awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works, and their spiritual outlook underwent significant changes. Many comrades said: Through this study, our revolutionary spirit has been invigorated, our proletarian soul has been awakened, and our party spirit has been strengthened. Especially during the Cultural Revolution, everyone received profound education, touched their souls, realized that bourgeois individualism is the root of all evil, and resolved to thoroughly eliminate the "self" and "private" characters, to study Chairman Mao's works for life, to transform their thoughts for life, and to always follow Chairman Mao's words, becoming thorough revolutionaries.

The purely business-oriented viewpoint not only opposes Mao Zedong Thought on a series of fundamental and principled issues in running enterprises but also stubbornly manifests itself in the process of learning from Daqing. What to learn from Daqing? How to learn? There are two kinds of thoughts and methods in struggle.

The reason this session of the study class achieved such remarkable results is fundamentally that it insisted on emphasizing politics and running the class according to Mao Zedong Thought. They insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline, using the two-line struggle as a weapon, using Daqing as a model, and on the basis of self-awareness of revolution, insisting on the principle of combining theory with practice, through on-site practice, conducting debates, raising sensory knowledge to rational knowledge, continuously summarizing, and continuously improving. They honestly followed the rules of epistemology indicated by Chairman Mao, studying Daqing's experience of running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought.

Learning from Daqing mainly involves learning Daqing's experience of emphasizing politics and running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought. This is a matter of the direction and path of enterprises, a major issue related to preventing and opposing revisionism and avoiding the restoration of capitalism, thoroughly carrying out the socialist revolution, and gradually transitioning to communism. Without grasping this fundamental issue, the spirit of Daqing's experience cannot be truly learned, and it is impossible to truly establish Daqing-style enterprises.

The students unanimously agreed that on-site practice played an important role in learning Daqing's experience. The things learned on-site are true, deeply felt, and firmly remembered, laying a good foundation for the debate on emphasizing politics.

In the debate on emphasizing politics, the "one study, three comparisons" method (studying Chairman Mao's works, comparing the situation of class struggle, comparing Daqing's experience, and comparing the situation of enterprises and oneself) was widely used. Through "one study, three comparisons," the principle of combining theory with practice was better implemented, self-education among the masses was carried out, and the study was promoted to a deeper level.

The process of learning from Daqing is also a process of self-transformation. Solving the problem of the direction and path of running enterprises is not only a revolution in ideological awareness but ultimately a transformation of worldview. Only by daring to put oneself in it, exposing one's views, opening one's mind, revealing contradictions, and using Chairman Mao's thoughts to solve contradictions, can one promote the proletarian and eliminate the bourgeois, raising awareness.

This session of the study class was in the midst of the high tide of the nationwide Cultural Revolution. The students actively participated in this struggle, condemning, criticizing, and exposing anti-party and anti-socialist ghosts and demons. In the struggle, their hatred for class enemies was aroused, their understanding of class and class struggle was enhanced, and the study was further promoted and deepened.

At the end of the study, many students excitedly expressed that they would definitely spread Daqing's experience throughout the country, learn from Daqing, and create Daqing-style enterprises in the struggle of the Cultural Revolution.

    千多名企业领导干部在大庆蹲点学习思想革命化经验
    按照毛泽东思想创办大庆式企业
    培养非常无产阶级化的产业大军
    社会主义企业不仅是社会主义建设的阵地，更重要的是社会主义革命的阵地；突出政治，用毛泽东思想办企业，必须以阶级斗争为纲，三大革命运动一起抓，彻底破除单纯业务观点。
    新华社二十九日讯　国家经委、中共中央工业交通政治部和中华全国总工会联合举办的大庆经验学习班第一期，已在最近结束。在两个月的学习期间，学员们集中学习了突出政治、按照毛泽东思想办企业的问题，比较系统地批判了单纯业务观点，明确了突出政治、按照毛泽东思想办企业的伟大战略意义，增强了阶级斗争观念，进一步振奋了革命精神，增强了创办大庆式企业的信心和决心。
    这期学习班是在大庆举办的。参加学习的有一百零三个企业的一千二百个领导干部。他们通过参观、蹲点、听大庆经验介绍、开展突出政治大辩论、参加文化大革命、学习总结等活动，深刻认识到：突出政治，就是突出毛泽东思想，就是用毛泽东思想统帅一切；突出政治必须落实到人的思想革命化；要突出政治，用毛泽东思想办企业，必须牢固地树立阶级斗争观点，以阶级斗争为纲，三大革命运动一起抓，彻底破除单纯业务观点。
    在系统地批判单纯业务观点后，学员们进一步明确了社会主义企业不仅是社会主义建设的阵地，更重要的是社会主义革命的阵地；企业的任务不仅要出产品，更重要的是要培养一支非常无产阶级化、革命化、战斗化、现代化的产业大军，把企业办成毛泽东思想的大学校；办企业一不能靠强迫命令，二不能靠物质刺激，只能靠加强政治思想工作，以毛泽东思想武装人的头脑，提高人的阶级觉悟，充分发挥积极性和创造性，变成巨大的物质力量；必须依靠广大职工群众办企业，对压在群众头上的“专家”、“权威”要彻底打倒，对束缚群众积极性的“洋框框”、“旧框框”，必须彻底破除；必须保证党对企业的绝对领导，企业领导要把政治领导放在首位，必须认真贯彻民主集中制，进一步认清了国内外特别是企业内部阶级斗争的形势，明确了企业中的主要矛盾是无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义和资本主义两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，增强了阶级斗争观念。
    通过学习，学员们在大庆这座革命熔炉中受到了锻炼，提高了学习毛主席著作的自觉性，精神面貌有了很大变化。许多同志说：通过这次学习，振奋了革命精神，唤回了无产阶级灵魂，增强了党性。特别是在无产阶级文化大革命中，大家受到了深刻的教育，触动了灵魂，认识到资产阶级个人主义是万恶之源，决心彻底革掉“我”字和“私”字，决心学一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想，永远听毛主席的话，作一个彻底的革命派。
    单纯业务观点，不仅在办企业的一系列根本性原则性问题上与毛泽东思想针锋相对，在学大庆的过程中也顽强地表现出来。学大庆学什么？怎么学？都存在着两种思想、两种方法的斗争。
    这期学习班所以取得这样显著的成绩，最根本的是坚持突出政治，按照毛泽东思想办学。他们坚持以毛泽东思想为指针，以两分法为武器，以大庆为样板，在自觉革命的基础上，坚持理论联系实际的原则，通过蹲点实践，开展辩论，把感性认识上升到理性认识，不断总结，不断提高。他们老老实实地遵循毛主席所指示的认识论的规律，学习大庆用毛泽东思想办企业的经验。
    学大庆主要是学习大庆突出政治，按毛泽东思想办企业的经验，这是企业的方向道路问题，是关系到防修反修和避免资本主义复辟，彻底进行社会主义革命并逐步过渡到共产主义的大问题。不抓住这个根本问题，大庆经验的精神实质就学不到手，也就不可能真正创办大庆式企业。
    学员们一致认为：蹲点实践对学好大庆经验起了重要的作用，蹲点学到的东西看得真，感受深，记得牢，为突出政治大辩论打下良好基础。
    在突出政治大辩论中，广泛运用了“一学三摆”（学毛主席著作，摆阶级斗争形势，摆大庆经验，摆企业和自己的情况）方法。通过“一学三摆”，更好地贯彻了理论联系实际的原则，开展了群众性的自我教育，推动了学习的深入发展。
    学习大庆的过程，也是自我改造的过程。解决办企业的方向道路问题，不仅是思想认识上的革命，归根到底是世界观的改造。只有敢于把自己摆进去，把观点亮出来，敞开思想，揭露矛盾，用毛主席思想来解决矛盾，才能兴无灭资，提高觉悟。
    这期学习班正处在全国无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，学员们积极地投入了这场斗争，对反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神进行了声讨、批判和揭发。在斗争中激发了对阶级敌人的仇恨，提高了对阶级和阶级斗争的认识，更有力地推动和促进了学习的深入发展。
    在学习结束的时候，许多学员都激动地表示，一定要把大庆的经验传播到全国各地去，在无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中，学大庆，创造大庆式企业。
