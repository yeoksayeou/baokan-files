People of Wuhan, Xi'an, and other places resolutely support the statement of our government. The Chinese people vow to be the steadfast backbone of the Vietnamese people.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 6th: Workers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company held a meeting on the 6th. They sternly warned the U.S. imperialists: The Chinese people's support for Vietnam's resistance against the U.S. is unrestricted and unlimited. There are no boundaries in war. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people dare to defy all reactionaries and are ready at any time to make the U.S. imperialist paper tiger bleed.

	Flame-smelting technician, born a worker, Bao Xiuliang, pointed out at the meeting that Chinese workers most resolutely support the statement of our government. The Chinese people have always stood at the forefront of opposing U.S. imperialist aggression. Chairman Mao's thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers makes us fearless in our struggle against U.S. imperialism. We are prepared to give the U.S. imperialists the heaviest blows at any time.

	Over a thousand activists studying Chairman Mao's works in Huangtan Commune, Xunyang County, held a rally to support the Vietnamese people. Former volunteer soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and brigade commander of Chaoyuan Brigade, Xiong Muhuan, said at the meeting, "The Chinese people have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon, and we do not put the U.S. imperialists in our eyes at all. Our millions of peasant brothers are ready at any time to fight side by side with the Vietnamese people and beat the U.S. imperialists to a pulp."

	Faculty, staff, and students of Wuhan University have been holding meetings in recent days, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes of aggression against Vietnam and vowing to be the steadfast backbone of the Vietnamese people.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 7th: The people of Xi'an strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' crazy and barbaric acts of aggression and war by bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. Old Red Army soldier and staff chief of the Xi'an High-Voltage Ceramic Factory Militia Regiment, Guo Fengguang, pointed out that Chairman Mao said, "To create disorder, fail, create disorder again, fail again, until they perish, this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause." The U.S. imperialists bombing Hanoi and Haiphong is them following this logic towards their doom. He said, "The Chinese working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, holds high the banner of proletarian internationalism, resolutely supports the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and national salvation, and resolutely supports the liberation struggle of the revolutionary people of the world. We are determined to contribute all our strength together with the Vietnamese people and all revolutionary people of the world to bury the U.S. imperialists, the common enemy of all people of the world."

	Xi'an workers have been holding meetings in recent days to denounce the U.S. imperialists' new crimes of aggression and war. They unanimously support the statement of our government. Farmers in various communes in the suburbs of Xi'an have also held many denunciation meetings. Party branch secretary of the vanguard brigade of Maqi Village People's Commune, Wang Zhilong, angrily said at the meeting, "We warn the U.S. aggressors, your unrestrained aggression in Vietnam will definitely make you bleed. Wherever your claws of aggression reach, we will make your corpses lie there!"

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th: The people of Nanjing resolutely support the statement of our government on July 3rd and strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. They pointed out that we have the great Mao Zedong Thought, and we have seven hundred million people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. This is the strongest force to counter the U.S. imperialists' aggression. If the U.S. imperialists dare to make new adventures in Vietnam, the seven hundred million Chinese people dare to bury them thoroughly.

	Some factories in Nanjing have been holding meetings in recent days. At the meeting held in the Nanjing Radio Factory, volunteers who had fought against the U.S. imperialists on the Korean battlefield, such as He Xin, Li Zhongting, and Fang Guangrui, pointed out that the U.S. imperialists look ferocious but are actually a paper tiger. Now our country is even stronger, and the anti-U.S. tide of the world's people is even higher. We have the power to drive the U.S. imperialists out of Vietnam.

	Some demobilized soldiers, militia cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives, and activists studying Chairman Mao's works in the Yuhuatai People's Commune of Nanjing held a meeting. Activist studying Chairman Mao's works and representative of the Nanjing Poor People's Association, Yao Guangrong, said, "Chairman Mao teaches us that the U.S. imperialists are paper tigers and will definitely be defeated. We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words and fight against the U.S. imperialists to the end, until we defeat them."

	Faculty and students of Jiangsu Labor University, Nanjing University, Nanjing Normal College, East China Institute of Water Conservancy, and Nanjing Forestry College have been holding meetings in recent days.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 6th: The people of Hefei strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong.

	An activist studying Chairman Mao's works in Anhui Province and textile worker, Huang Guilan, said, "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have never put the U.S. imperialists in our eyes. We Chinese workers listen to Chairman Mao the most. Chairman Mao teaches us that as long as imperialism exists in the world, war exists. We have no illusions about the U.S. imperialists and can only fight them, fight them hard."

	Young members of the Honghua Village People's Commune in the suburbs of Hefei, militia members Liu Shoucai, and female militia member Zheng Qin pointed out, "Chairman Mao tells us that the U.S. imperialists are paper tigers. No matter how ferocious the U.S. imperialists are, they cannot scare us Chinese people. We are ready at any time to drive the U.S. imperialists out of the places they have invaded together with the Vietnamese people and all revolutionary people of the world."
