	Asia-Pacific Peace Liaison Committee observer Louis A. E. (Aylward) said at the emergency meeting of the Asian-African Writers' Conference today that Asian and African writers should unite to overthrow imperialism and all forms of colonialism, and must resolutely participate in the struggle against revisionism, which has become an integral part of the structure of our common enemy.

	Louis A. E. (Aylward) said in his speech that Beijing is the base of the revolutionary people of the world, and it is the Beijing of Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong's thought is a great encouragement to all liberation struggles.

	He said, as Chairman Mao wisely pointed out, in the face of the organized power of the people, imperialism and all reactionaries are nothing but paper tigers. The Vietnamese people will surely win.

	He said that he saw everywhere in Chinese villages and towns that the Chinese people regard the cause of the Vietnamese people as their own cause. Every Chinese person firmly believes that they must fully support the Vietnamese people.

	He condemned the Soviet revisionists for colluding with American imperialism and engaging in a series of backroom deals with American imperialism.

	He said that any small country, whether socialist or non-socialist, cannot guarantee that its basic interests will not be sold out in their dirty game of power politics. The "aid" of revisionism is just like the "aid" of imperialism, which can also turn into a "kiss of death."

    亚太和联观察员艾黎的发言
    新华社四日讯　亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会观察员路易·艾黎今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上强调说，亚非作家们应该团结起来打倒帝国主义和一切形式的殖民主义，同时必须坚决参加反对修正主义的战斗，修正主义已成为我们共同敌人结构中不可分割的一部分。
    路易·艾黎在发言中说，北京是世界革命人民的根据地，是毛泽东的北京。毛泽东的思想是对一切解放斗争的巨大鼓舞。
    他说，正如毛主席英明地说过的，在组织起来的人民力量面前，帝国主义和一切反动派不过是纸老虎。获得胜利的将是越南人民。
    他说，我在中国村庄和城镇到处都看到中国人民把越南人民的事业看作是中国人民自己的事业。每个中国人都坚信必须全力支持越南人民。
    他谴责苏联修正主义者勾结美帝国主义，同美帝国主义进行一系列幕后交易。
    他说，任何小国，不论是社会主义还是非社会主义国家，都不能保证自己的基本利益不会在他们玩弄强权政治的肮脏把戏中被出卖，修正主义的“援助”正象帝国主义的“援助”一样，也是能变成“死神之吻”的。
