Edition: 1

The great Communist warrior Liu Yingjun, who was formerly a member of the company led by Comrade Li Changwan, has been passionately reporting the brilliant deeds of Comrade Liu Yingjun to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in the capital since July 23. He has already given eight reports. Each report is an extremely vivid and profound political lesson. Everyone unanimously says: We must take Liu Yingjun as our example, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Li Changwan's report, with specific and vivid facts, introduced Liu Yingjun's noble qualities and heroic deeds. Liu Yingjun's life once again powerfully proved that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the reddest hearts, the brightest eyes, the most steadfast proletarian stance, and can withstand the sternest tests. Liu Yingjun is indeed a great Communist warrior nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The following is an excerpt from one of Li Changwan's reports.

Our closest comrade-in-arms, Liu Yingjun, sacrificed his life on March 15, 1966, to protect the lives of the people.

Chairman Mao said more than twenty years ago:

"We must train a large number of people. These people are the vanguard of the revolution. These people have political foresight. These people are full of the spirit of struggle and sacrifice. These people are open-hearted, loyal, active, and upright. These people do not seek personal gain but dedicate themselves entirely to the liberation of the nation and society. These people are not afraid of difficulties and are always firm and brave in the face of them. These people are not arrogant but are down-to-earth and practical. China needs a large group of such vanguard fighters. The tasks of the Chinese revolution can then be smoothly accomplished."

After studying Chairman Mao's words, we deeply feel that Liu Yingjun is exactly the kind of person Chairman Mao hoped for, exactly the great Communist warrior nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Liu Yingjun's brilliant deeds are extremely rich and outstanding. Here, I will only report a few main aspects to you:

**Unlimited Love for Chairman Mao**

Liu Yingjun, like millions of other young people from worker and poor peasant families in our country, loves our Party, loves Chairman Mao, loves the socialist system, and loves the great Mao Zedong Thought.

He was born into a poor peasant family and often heard his parents talk about the hardships of the old society and the sweetness of the new society, educating him not to forget the past.

Once, his mother took him to see the old brick kiln where the family used to live before liberation.

Liu Yingjun asked, "Mom, why are we coming here?"

His mother said, "Yingjun, this was our home in the old society!"

Liu Yingjun was surprised, "How can people live in a place where you can't even stand upright?"

His mother said sadly, "Son, I gave birth to you in this place. Think about the past, look at the present, if the Party and Chairman Mao hadn't saved us from the fire, who knows where our lives would have gone..."

Liu Yingjun was deeply moved. He hated the old society from the bottom of his heart, loved the new society, and loved our great leader Chairman Mao even more.

In June 1962, when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, with the support of American imperialism, attempted to invade the mainland, Liu Yingjun repeatedly applied to join the People's Liberation Army of China. At that time, he was just seventeen years old.

In the army, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, Liu Yingjun studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, feeling more and more deeply the wisdom and greatness of Chairman Mao. He said, "When I was young, I loved to sing 'There is a North Star in the sky, and there is Mao Zedong on the earth.' But it was only in these past few years that I truly understood this song." He pointed to the bright North Star in the sky and sang passionately, "Chairman Mao is the 'North Star' of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao is also the 'North Star' of the people of the world." He hung four portraits of Chairman Mao on the four walls of his dormitory and gazed at them with deep affection every day. When the unit went out on duty, before setting out, his first task was to take down the portrait of Chairman Mao and wrap it carefully. Upon arriving at the new station, he first cleaned the dust off the walls and hung the portrait of Chairman Mao up neatly.

Before the Spring Festival this year, Liu Yingjun took leave to visit his family. Before leaving, he specially told the platoon leader Li Hongji, "Platoon leader, if our platoon moves, someone must be responsible for Chairman Mao's portrait. When we arrive at the new station, hang up Chairman Mao's portrait first, so that comrades can see Chairman Mao every day." The platoon leader asked if there was anything else. He said, "Nothing else, this is my only concern!"

From this, we see how deeply Liu Yingjun loved our beloved leader Chairman Mao! This feeling is the common feeling of the broad masses of laboring people in our country, and it is also what those anti-Party, anti-socialist bourgeoisie cannot understand, and what makes them tremble with fear!

**Consciously and Thoroughly Transforming One's Worldview**

When Liu Yingjun joined the army, it was during the time when our army, under the leadership of the Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao, was holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launching the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works for nearly two years. As soon as Liu Yingjun arrived at the unit, he enthusiastically supported and responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to "read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "learn from Comrade Lei Feng," Liu Yingjun more clearly realized that to make progress, to revolutionize, and to serve the people, one must learn Mao Zedong Thought like Lei Feng. He studied diligently, worked hard, and learned as if he were starving and thirsty. Sometimes, after standing guard at night, he would still seize the time to study a few sentences from Chairman Mao's quotations. Once, during a unit's rush to harvest soybeans, he carried the most and ran the fastest, sweating all over. During a rest, he took out Chairman Mao's works and started studying. Others saw him exhausted and advised him to rest. He said, "Because I am tired, I need to draw strength from Chairman Mao's works; otherwise, I will lose my energy!"

He studied Chairman Mao's works and deeply felt that Chairman Mao's books are "books of class struggle, books of making revolution." He said, "Mao Zedong Thought has shown me the way forward." He enthusiastically wrote a poem to praise:

Chairman Mao's works are like the sun,
Every word and sentence shines with gold,
Illuminating the hearts of soldiers,
Guiding work and study.

Comrade Lin Biao proposed that studying Chairman Mao's works should be done with problems in mind, actively applying what is learned, combining learning with use, learning urgently what is needed immediately, and seeing results right away. Liu Yingjun firmly did this. He set rules for himself: for every article he reads, he must ask himself four questions: one, what did Chairman Mao say; two, what do I think; three, what do I do; four, what should I do in the future. He said this and did it. His brilliant life was a life of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, a life of serving the people wholeheartedly according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

Those bourgeois "authorities" tried to block the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers from studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and to sever the flesh-and-blood connection between the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and Mao Zedong Thought. This is utterly impossible. Liu Yingjun's firm belief in Mao Zedong Thought and his love for the principle of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works are a powerful rebuttal to those anti-Party, anti-socialist gangs!

Liu Yingjun had several distinctive features in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

He particularly emphasized studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, establishing a clear view of class and class struggle. In his diary, he once wrote: "I have read Chairman Mao's works and been deeply educated and enlightened.... It has made me understand the revolutionary question of who our enemies and friends are; it has also made me understand class struggle, proletarian revolution, proletarian dictatorship, communism...." In a study discussion meeting, he clearly stated that he would always remember the Party's teachings, not forget class struggle, not forget proletarian dictatorship, not forget relying on poor and lower-middle peasants, not forget the Party's policies, and not forget the Party's work.

Starting from the needs of domestic and international class struggle and the needs of the revolutionary cause, he grasped the transformation of his worldview and self-criticism in his studies, constantly waging a struggle within himself to eliminate bourgeois ideas.

He demanded a lot from himself, fighting particularly hard against selfishness. As soon as he found any shortcomings, he would frankly admit them, actively inspect them, and correct them resolutely. What is even more precious is that after doing good deeds, he still followed Chairman Mao's teachings, setting high standards and strict requirements. There is a story:

One winter night in 1963, at around one in the morning, the medic Bear Zhiyi returned from sentry duty and saw that the lights in the third platoon were still on. He thought, Liu Yingjun had just finished his sentry duty at twelve, so maybe he hadn't gone to sleep yet? He gently pushed open the door and walked in. He saw Liu Yingjun leaning over the table, studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Bear Zhiyi said, "An hour has passed, why haven't you gone to sleep yet?" Liu Yingjun smiled and said, "I can't! If I don't study Chairman Mao's works, I will lose my direction, not knowing for whom I am a soldier, what kind of soldier I am, for whom I work, and how to do my work well." It turned out that a window in our unit's stable was broken. Liu Yingjun discovered it but didn't block it up in time. Until this sentry duty, he saw the wind and snow blowing in and quickly found a board to nail it up. Bear Zhiyi said, "It's good that you nailed it up." Liu Yingjun said, "You can't say that. Didn't Chairman Mao say, 'Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness and devotion to duty...' And me? I only thought of blocking this hole now. Isn't this a lack of such a spirit of extreme responsibility?"

Chairman Mao taught us that studying revolutionary theory is for the needs of revolutionary practice, "you want to know the theory and methods of revolution, you must participate in the revolution"; "to change the phenomenon of completely separating theory from practice, learning from work, and thus to make one's class stance, the Party's stance, and Party nature more firm." Liu Yingjun was exactly like this. He studied Chairman Mao's works, dared to practice, insisted on learning for the revolution and using what he learned for the revolution, learning in revolutionary struggles, and using what he learned in revolutionary struggles. He combined theory with practice completely, combined the transformation of the subjective world with the transformation of the objective world completely.

"Fish rely on water, melons rely on vines, the growth of revolutionary soldiers relies entirely on the great Mao Zedong Thought." Liu Yingjun, precisely because he armed his mind with Mao Zedong Thought, had already become, at the age of twenty-one when he sacrificed his life, what Chairman Mao said, a noble person, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person who has shed low-level tastes, a person beneficial to the people. From many of his diary entries, we can see that he had reached a very high level in transforming his worldview. He said:

"A true communist is a person who has broken free from the shackles of the small 'I,' whose mind is filled only with the interests of the revolution and the collective. As long as something is beneficial to the revolution and the collective, they will actively do it, without considering fame and position, and without worrying about what others will say about them. They are the most noble people in humanity, just like Norman Bethune.... I will definitely take Norman Bethune as my example.... and forever be a vanguard of the revolution."

"To make a revolution, one must struggle; fearing struggle means not daring to make a revolution. For us proletarian revolutionaries, we have dedicated everything to the cause of communist revolution, apart from participating in revolutionary struggles, what greater happiness is there?"

"Born for the revolution, die for the revolution, everything for the revolution, the revolution is above everything."

He also said, "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai, and to live for the people's interests is also heavier than Mount Tai." We can use these two sentences to evaluate his life, and it is completely appropriate.

He had a heart for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Every time Chairman Mao issued statements supporting the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries, he responded enthusiastically and clearly stated his position.

In his diary, he repeatedly expressed his firm determination to support the world revolution at any time. He said, "I will definitely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly stand on the front line of the anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist struggle, and be a vanguard of patriotism and internationalism."

Now, American imperialism has escalated its aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious stage. Chairman Liu Shaoqi issued a statement, solemnly declaring: The 700 million people of China are the firm rear guard of the Vietnamese people. The vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. To support the Vietnamese people in achieving a thorough victory in the anti-American war, the Chinese people are prepared to make the greatest national sacrifices. We must learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun's internationalist spirit, be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, and fight side by side with the Vietnamese people to strike down the American aggressors.

**Sincerely Serving the People**

Chairman Mao taught us: "It is not difficult for a person to do a good deed, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life, not to do bad deeds, to be beneficial to the broad masses all one's life, to be beneficial to the youth all one's life, to be beneficial to the revolution all one's life, to struggle hard for decades as if it were one day. This is the most difficult thing!"

Liu Yingjun firmly followed Chairman Mao's instructions. He combined his great aspiration to serve the people with concrete, down-to-earth deeds that benefit the collective and the people, constantly raising his class consciousness in the concrete practice of serving the people.

He had two most distinctive features in doing good deeds:

First, he had a clear class standpoint.

He had the deepest class feelings for poor and lower-middle peasants. Every time he went out on maneuvers, he would first conduct a social survey upon arriving at a new station, knowing exactly who was a poor peasant, who was a family of martyrs or military dependents. Then, he would go to help them with their work. He did the same when he helped the people in the area near the camp. Once, the unit went out to work in the fields, and he saw an old poor peasant couple, both in their sixties, living alone and having some difficulties. He was not afraid of dirt or hard work and almost every day went to help them carry water and sweep the yard. He said, "You may not see their home as clean, but their hearts are the cleanest. We are the sons of poor peasants, and when poor peasants have difficulties, we should care for them." As winter approached, he got up early and worked late to dig a vegetable cellar for the old couple. When the unit left, the old grandmother, tears in her eyes, said to the company leader, "This child is so kind to us poor peasants!"

His second distinctive feature in doing good deeds was that he was sincere and down-to-earth, without the slightest intention of showing off.

He often helped the people in the Jiamusi City Jixi District Thirty-Seven Committee area, helping one family buy grain and another carry water. The longer the time, the more good deeds he did, the more the people liked him. But it was only after his sacrifice that everyone knew his name was Liu Yingjun. Military dependent Grandpa Liu held Liu Yingjun's portrait in both hands, tears welling up in his eyes, saying, "Child! You hid your true name from Grandpa all your life!" Another old grandmother said, "He has memorized all of Chairman Mao's works, he truly serves the people with all his heart!"

A few days before the Spring Festival last year, the Jiamusi City Jixi Commercial Store was very busy. Liu Yingjun and more than a dozen other comrades came here to help with the sales. Liu Yingjun was assigned to the outdoor stall of the furniture section. At that time, it was very cold, with light snow and northwest wind. Liu Yingjun stood there all day, enthusiastically serving the customers. A farmer came to buy a quilt, and Liu Yingjun enthusiastically helped him choose the most satisfactory one and tied it up for him. Liu Yingjun saw that his hands were frozen, so he tied a rope for him, saying, "This way, you can carry it on your back, which is convenient and won't freeze your hands." The farmer gratefully said, "You think of everything, thank you."

After Liu Yingjun's sacrifice, the comrades in the unit and the masses universally recalled the numerous good deeds he had done in his life. Everyone said that his two hands were never idle. In the dormitory, there were the quotation boards and bookshelves he made, the doors, windows, and tables he repaired; on the playground, there were the basketball hoops he repaired, the basketball nets he wove, and the drainage ditches he dug; in the clubhouse, there were the blackboards he repaired, the study gardens he arranged, and the slogans he wrote; in the kitchen, there were the stoves and other kitchen utensils he repaired... His good deeds were innumerable. In the hospital, he helped the seriously ill carry water and deliver meals, assisted the hospital staff in sweeping the floors and cleaning the toilets, and was a "laboring convalescent." On the journey, he helped the elderly and children, busied himself with this and that, never rested, and was a "volunteer train attendant."

He did so many good deeds but never left his name, never told the leaders and comrades, and never recorded them in his diary. These good deeds were mostly done in his spare time, that is, in the so-called "one-third of life" time proposed by the counter-revolutionary Deng Tuo in his "Yanshan Black Talk." He was always for the revolution, always for the people. His deeds fully demonstrated the lofty qualities of a proletarian revolutionary soldier who does not seek fame or personal gain but sincerely serves the people.

**Firmly and Unswervingly Promoting Politics**

Chairman Mao taught us: Politics is the commander, the soul. Political work is the lifeline of our army. Liu Yingjun firmly carried out this instruction.

In 1964, when some people were influenced by the single-minded military viewpoint and showed a tendency to neglect politics, Liu Yingjun unshakably put studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the first place and resisted the impact of military matters on politics.

At that time, he was transferred to the artillery training team for training. Most of the comrades participating in the training were platoon leaders and deputy platoon leaders of artillery companies, and their military skills were quite proficient. Liu Yingjun had just become a gunner from a driver and had many difficulties in his studies. However, he believed that "the leadership sent me here to take over the class of Mao Zedong Thought, to take over the class of proletarian revolutionary cause." Therefore, he insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works every day.

One afternoon, Liu Yingjun was making a "one-help-one, one-red-pair" activity plan with a platoon leader who came with him. The two had a dispute.

The other side thought: Liu Yingjun's military foundation was weak, and he should use Sunday to review military subjects.

Liu Yingjun thought: Sunday should be used to study Chairman Mao's works and do good deeds more.

The other side said, "The training subjects are tightly scheduled, and you can't keep up. You should use Sunday to make up for the lessons!"

Liu Yingjun said, "To make up for lessons, we should first make up for the lessons in our minds. Studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the most important lesson. As long as we put studying Chairman Mao's works in the first place, we have Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, and military skills can be learned well!"

Liu Yingjun insisted on doing this, showing a high level of awareness in promoting politics. By the end of the training, his ideological awareness had reached a new height, and his military skills had also achieved good results.

Liu Yingjun paid great attention to the political and ideological construction of the company and often proposed suggestions to the leadership and voluntarily did a lot of political and ideological work.

In the winter of 1963, Liu Yingjun was a soldier in the third platoon. He often suggested to the platoon leader to organize everyone to study Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind. For a period, the platoon's study of Chairman Mao's works was not closely linked to reality, so Liu Yingjun suggested to the platoon leader Jin Wanmin, "Platoon leader, I have a suggestion for you. I think our platoon's study of Chairman Mao's works has problems in its methods. You should pay attention to the comrades' ideological state, organize study according to the active thoughts in the platoon. First, read the articles, then discuss and raise personal ideological issues, and finally check the learning effect in practice. The platoon should set an example and promote everyone to learn better and use better."

In 1965, Liu Yingjun went to the medical team for recuperation. He kept the platoon's study of Chairman Mao's works in mind and never forgot about it. When the platoon leader was too busy with training to visit him, and called to ask about his condition, he first asked with concern, "Platoon leader, how has our platoon's study of Chairman Mao's works been recently?" He also told the platoon leader, "I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works well and ensure I don't fall behind!"

Liu Yingjun, in carrying out the company's cultural activities, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," firmly implemented Chairman Mao's policy of serving proletarian politics with literature and art, and was called the vanguard of the company's cultural revolution. He proposed to the company leader, "Our company's performance team, although it only performs small programs, small programs should have a big direction!" He drew a large number of slides, closely matching the company's political and ideological education. When new soldiers joined, he drew "Chairman Mao's Good Soldier - Lei Feng"; during class education, he drew "Bitterness Family History"; during situation education, he drew "Letter from the South," "Ouan Van Chuyen," and "Record of American Crimes." Since March last year alone, he has edited and revised more than ten cultural programs, drawn twenty-three sets of slides, and published more than sixty issues of blackboard newspapers, enthusiastically praising the Party and Chairman Mao's wise leadership, praising the great victories of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and praising the heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

The *Liberation Army Daily* said in an editorial calling on the entire army to learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun, "A comrade, regardless of the position he holds, as long as he can truly take Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions for all work, as the highest standard for distinguishing right from wrong, he can stand high, see far, and in any situation, promote proletarian politics, and in any time, not lose his direction." From Liu Yingjun's model deeds, we have a deeper understanding that if every cadre and soldier can, like him, insist on the direction of promoting politics, then promoting politics will definitely have the broadest mass base and the most reliable guarantee.

**Making the Spread of Mao Zedong Thought a Lifetime Mission**

Chairman Mao taught, "We should strive to propagate socialism and communism among the working class." Comrade Liu Yingjun responded to this call with practical actions. He used various opportunities, through various channels, and in various ways, actively and enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought, inspiring and encouraging his comrades in the company, his relatives and friends in his hometown, teachers and students in his school, to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

In carrying out the company's cultural activities, Liu Yingjun, through editing programs, writing slogans, creating poems, publishing blackboard newspapers, leading revolutionary songs, and reading revolutionary books, enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought. Every time he drew a set of slides or created a program, he would first study Chairman Mao's relevant statements, even in tasks that were heavy and time was tight. He would add Chairman Mao's words at the beginning and end of the slides he drew. He said, we should let comrades "hear Chairman Mao's words at any time and place."

Liu Yingjun, with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, organized and helped his comrades in the company to study Chairman Mao's works. He often said, "Revolution is everyone's business, you have a share, and I have a share. If one person doesn't study Chairman Mao's works, it means one less revolutionary force, and this is no longer just one person's business!"

In 1965, Han Shaoying was assigned from the new recruits to the artillery company as a soldier. That evening, Liu Yingjun immediately paired up with him in the "one-help-one, one-red-pair" activity. He told Han Shaoying, "We are both revolutionary soldiers, the most important thing to be a good soldier is to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions." Saying this, he studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with him. Han Shaoying stayed in the company for nine days, and he patiently helped him for nine days. There was also a soldier named Duan Tian'an who couldn't read when he joined the army. Liu Yingjun helped him study Chairman Mao's works and taught him to recognize characters. Duan Tian'an, under his help, loved Chairman Mao's books even more and slowly could also study some articles by himself.

To let everyone act according to Mao Zedong Thought, Liu Yingjun also carefully made two quotation boards of Chairman Mao's words and hung them on the walls of the third platoon. He changed the quotations every few days. In one year, Liu Yingjun selected and wrote more than a hundred quotations from Chairman Mao on class struggle, serving the people, people's war, criticism and self-criticism, frugality, unity, and other topics, timely helping the platoon solve real ideological problems and strongly promoting everyone's ideological revolutionization.

Liu Yingjun regarded letter writing as an important channel for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. He often wrote quotations from Chairman Mao on the envelopes, so that the recipients would see Chairman Mao's teachings first. He wrote to comrades, friends, and classmates many times, introducing his experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. He heard that his cousin was participating in the socialist education movement in the countryside and immediately mailed her a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," also writing on the quotation book, "Keep your eyes on the golden book and follow the Party," urging her to "study Chairman Mao's works more, arm your mind with Mao Zedong Thought, and guide your thoughts and actions."

Liu Yingjun had a classmate named Tian Ruilian who dropped out of school due to illness. During the Spring Festival in 1966, Liu Yingjun took leave to visit his family and saw her. In their conversation, she mentioned wanting to stay in the city for work. Liu Yingjun said, "The industrial front needs people, and the agricultural front needs people even more. In my opinion, it's better to go to where the motherland needs you the most! Agricultural labor is relatively hard, and we young people should carry heavy burdens." Tian Ruilian thought for a moment and said, "You can rest assured, I will follow the motherland's needs."

After Liu Yingjun returned to the unit, he was still not at ease and wrote to Tian Ruilian twice more, encouraging her to devote herself to agriculture, "give your red heart to the Party, do whatever the Party asks you to do."

On March 12, just three days before Liu Yingjun's heroic sacrifice, he wrote to Tian Ruilian again, urging her to take root in the countryside. In the letter, he quoted Chairman Mao's teachings on the proletarianization of intellectuals, encouraging Tian Ruilian to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, follow the Party's arrangements, and devote herself to building socialist new villages.

Tian Ruilian, after reading this letter full of Mao Zedong Thought, made up her mind to go to the agricultural front. She also, like Comrade Liu Yingjun, enthusiastically helped three other classmates, persuaded their families, and went with her to the countryside to participate in agricultural production labor.

Liu Yingjun paid great attention to the growth of young children, using Mao Zedong Thought to educate children to advance in the direction of red successors. Before his sacrifice, he was an off-campus counselor for Yong'an Primary School in Jiamusi City. The first time he spoke to the children, he talked about reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being a good child of Chairman Mao. He saw some children drawing "Bao Gong," and he said, "Red youth should draw red heroes." He saw some children reading the comic book "Chasing Fish," and he said, "Red youth should read red books." He also specially bought more than ten comic books about revolutionary heroes and gave them to the children. He thought that the education of children should also emphasize politics and Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, he suggested to the teachers of the class he was counseling to strengthen the revolutionary ideological education of the children. He said, "Political and ideological education of students is an important aspect of cultivating students," "it is the key to the work." He also propagated to the school teachers the principles of Comrade Lin Biao on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, hoping they would strive to study Chairman Mao's works.

When he was on duty for public affairs or hospitalized and could not go to the school to counsel, he would use letters to carry out his work. Before his sacrifice, he had written many letters to the school teachers and children. There were two letters, one written at 10:30 PM and the other at 10:47 PM.

Liu Yingjun propagated Mao Zedong Thought and did not miss any opportunity. Last June, Liu Yingjun played ball at the Jiamusi Textile Factory Children's School and met a student. This student later became a salesperson. He initially did not understand the importance of this job, feeling "lowly," and did not dare to lift his head when he saw his classmates. Liu Yingjun knew this and enthusiastically helped him study Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm his mind, making this young man raise his class consciousness and improve his service quality.

The more Liu Yingjun experienced, the more he realized that revolution could not be separated from Mao Zedong Thought, and the more urgently he hoped that others could also master Mao Zedong Thought. He truly regarded propagating Mao Zedong Thought as his lifelong combat mission! We must take him as our example and spread the great Mao Zedong Thought throughout China and the world!

**Bravely Defending Mao Zedong Thought**

Comrade Liu Yingjun, in the class struggle, studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide his practice in the class struggle. He was firm in his stance and had a keen sense of smell. He was not only alert to the armed invasions of imperialism but also to the "peaceful evolution" plots of domestic and foreign class enemies. To those anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought fallacies, he maintained the alertness of a proletarian revolutionary soldier and, once exposed, fought actively, resisted firmly, and bravely defended the great Mao Zedong Thought.

He had a book titled "Materials on the Counter-Revolutionary Hu Feng Gang." He often took it out to read and also suggested that the deputy platoon leader read it. The preface to this book and the editorial of the *People's Daily* pointed out that we must not only be good at distinguishing good people from bad people in normal situations but also be good at distinguishing certain people in special situations. "We must also deeply understand that as long as the members of our revolutionary ranks are politically complacent and lose vigilance against counter-revolutionaries, it will provide these counter-revolutionaries with conditions to carry out activities." He paid special attention to these words and drew lines on them.

In December 1964, he saw the bourgeois "authority" Feng Ding's slander of Mao Zedong Thought in the "theory of righteous indignation" in the book *Communist Worldview*, and he was very angry. He immediately wrote an article, severely refuting Feng Ding's reactionary fallacies.

This article refuted Feng Ding's revisionist fallacies thoroughly, exposing his true colors, once again proving that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the highest consciousness, the keenest sense of smell, and the strongest fighting spirit. They can see through all kinds of ghosts and monsters, and as long as they oppose Mao Zedong Thought, they dare to fight with them!

In the winter of 1964, when some ghosts and monsters were loudly praising the film *The Enemy at the Gate*, saying that it "stirred up people's fighting spirit" and "inspired people's revolutionary enthusiasm," Liu Yingjun saw through its reactionary nature at a glance. He criticized this bad film among the masses. In 1965, he also pointed out sharply in a conversation with the company leader, "That film does not conform to Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, nor does it conform to Chairman Mao's military thought, the direction is wrong!" After watching the novel *Struggle*, he also wrote an article, seriously pointing out that it was a bad novel against Mao Zedong Thought.

He never forgot class struggle in his life, and just before his sacrifice, he still organized his comrades in the platoon to study Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article criticizing Wu Han's anti-Party, anti-socialist crimes: *"On the New Historical Drama 'The Dismissal of Hai Rui.'"* We all unanimously felt that Liu Yingjun truly deserved to be called a brave defender of Mao Zedong Thought.

After Comrade Liu Yingjun's heroic sacrifice, our entire company enthusiastically launched the activity of learning from Comrade Liu Yingjun. Everyone studied the "Three Articles" that Liu Yingjun studied the most in his life, read the most precious diary left by Liu Yingjun, recalled Liu Yingjun's brilliant deeds, and carried out self-revolution. Every cadre and soldier made a firm resolution to learn from Liu Yingjun's loyalty to the Party, the people, Chairman Mao, and Mao Zedong Thought.

    向伟大的共产主义战士刘英俊同志学习
    ——刘英俊生前所在连指导员李昌万在首都青年学习刘英俊同志大会上的报告
    伟大的共产主义战士刘英俊生前所在连指导员李昌万，从二十三日开始，向首都广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子热情报告刘英俊同志的光辉事迹，先后已经报告八场。每场报告都是一堂极其生动深刻的政治课，人们异口同声地说：我们一定以刘英俊为榜样，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的高潮，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    李昌万的报告以具体生动的事实，介绍了刘英俊同志的高贵品质和英雄行为。刘英俊的生平又一次有力证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，心最红、眼最亮，无产阶级立场最坚定，最能经得起严峻的考验。刘英俊同志不愧为伟大的毛泽东思想所造就出来的伟大的共产主义战士。
    这里发表的，是李昌万同志一次报告的摘要。
    我们最亲密的战友刘英俊同志，为了保卫人民群众的生命安全，于一九六六年三月十五日英勇地牺牲了。
    毛主席在二十多年前就说过：
    “要造就一大批人，这些人是革命的先锋队。这些人具有政治的远见。这些人充满着斗争精神与牺牲精神。这些人是胸怀坦白的，忠诚的，积极的，与正直的。这些人不谋私利，唯一的为着民族与社会的解放。这些人不怕困难，在困难面前总是坚定的，勇敢向前的。这些人不是狂妄分子，也不是风头主义者，而是脚踏实地富于实际精神的人们。中国要有一大群这样的先锋分子，中国革命的任务就能够顺利的解决。”
    我们学习了毛主席的这条语录，深深感到，刘英俊正是毛主席所希望的这样的人，正是伟大的毛泽东思想所造就出来的伟大的共产主义战士。
    刘英俊同志的光辉事迹是非常丰富、非常突出的。这里，我只是把其中几个主要方面向同志们汇报一下：
    无限热爱毛主席
    刘英俊，同我国千千万万个出身于工人和贫下中农家庭的青年一样，无比地热爱我们党，热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义制度，热爱伟大的毛泽东思想。
    他出生在一个贫农家庭里，从小就经常听父母亲向他讲旧社会的苦，讲新社会的甜，教育他不要忘记过去。
    一次，他母亲领他到解放前全家住过的破砖窑那地方去看。
    刘英俊问：“妈，到这个地方来干啥？”
    他母亲说：“英俊啊！在旧社会，这可是咱们的家啊！”
    刘英俊很奇怪：“这个地方连腰都直不起来，怎能住人呢？”
    他母亲非常沉痛地说：“孩子，妈就是在这个地方生的你呀！想想过去，看看现在，要不是党和毛主席把咱们从火海里救出来，咱们的命都不知道哪里去了……”
    刘英俊听了以后，非常激动。他打心眼里痛恨旧社会，热爱新社会，更加热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席了。
    一九六二年六月，当蒋介石匪帮在美帝国主义的支持下，妄想窜犯大陆的时候，刘英俊三番五次地申请，参加了中国人民解放军。这时，他刚满十七岁。
    在部队这个毛泽东思想的大学校里，刘英俊活学活用毛主席著作，越来越深刻地感到毛主席的英明和伟大。他说：“我小时候就爱唱‘天上有个北斗星，地上有个毛泽东’这个歌。不过真正懂得这句话，还是在这几年。”他指着天上明亮的北斗星热情地歌颂：“毛主席是中国人民的‘北斗星’，毛主席也是世界人民的‘北斗星’。”他把四张毛主席象挂在宿舍的四面墙壁上，每天，都要深情仰望。部队外出执勤，出发前，他的第一件事，是把毛主席象取下来，用纸包好。到达新的驻地，他首先把墙上的灰尘打扫净，把毛主席的象端端正正地挂起来。
    今年春节前，刘英俊请假探家。临走的时候，他专门对班长李洪记同志说：“班长啊！咱们班要是挪动地方，毛主席象一定要有专人负责。到了新的驻地，先把毛主席象挂起来，好让同志们天天看到毛主席。”班长问他还有什么事情？他说：
    “没有别的，我就这一件心事！”
    从这里，我们看到，刘英俊对我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，是怀着多么深厚的无产阶级感情啊！这种感情，是我国广大劳动人民共同的感情，也是那些反党反社会主义的资产阶级老爷们所不能理解的，是最使他们胆战心惊的！
    自觉地彻底改造世界观
    刘英俊同志入伍的时候，正是我军在军委和林彪同志的英明领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起活学活用毛主席著作群众运动将近两年的时候。刘英俊一到部队，就对林彪同志提出的“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”的号召，表示积极拥护，热烈响应。毛主席发出“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召之后，刘英俊更明确地认识到，要进步，要革命，要为人民服务，就必须象雷锋那样，把毛泽东思想真正学到手。他勤奋地学，刻苦地学，如饥似渴地学，有时深夜站哨回来，还要抓紧时间学习一两段毛主席语录。一次，部队抢收黄豆，他在劳动中，挑得最多，跑得最快，累得浑身象水洗了似的。休息的时候，他拿出毛主席著作就学了起来。别人看他累得够呛，劝他休息一下。他说：“正因为累，才有必要从毛主席著作中汲取力量呢！不然，就没劲了！”
    他学习毛主席著作以后，深深体会到毛主席的书，“就是进行阶级斗争的书，就是闹革命的书”。他说：“毛泽东思想给我指明了前进的道路。”他热情地写诗歌颂：
    毛主席著作象太阳，
    字字句句闪金光，
    照得战士心里亮，
    工作学习有方向。
    林彪同志提出，学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影。刘英俊坚决这样做。他给自己规定：每读一篇文章，都要提出这样四个问题：一、毛主席是怎样讲的；二、我是怎样想的；三、我是怎样做的；四、今后应当怎样去做。他是这么说的，也是这么做的。他的光辉的一生，就是活学活用毛主席著作的一生，就是按照毛主席的教导，全心全意为人民服务的一生。
    那些资产阶级“权威”们，他们妄想阻挡广大工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作，妄想割断广大工农兵群众同毛泽东思想的血肉联系，这是根本办不到的。刘英俊这样坚定地信仰毛泽东思想，这样热爱活学活用的原则，这就是对那些反党反社会主义黑帮的最有力的回击！
    刘英俊活学活用毛主席著作，有几个明显的特点。
    他特别重视学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，树立了明确的阶级和阶级斗争的观点。他在日记中说过：“我读了毛主席著作，有极深刻的教育与启发。……使我了解了谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友这个革命的首要问题；又使我了解了阶级斗争，无产阶级革命，无产阶级专政，共产主义……。”在一次学习讨论会上，他明确地表示，要永远牢记党的教导，不要忘记阶级斗争，不要忘记无产阶级专政，不要忘记依靠贫下中农，不要忘记党的政策，不要忘记党的工作。
    他从国内外阶级斗争的需要出发，从革命事业的需要出发，在学习中，狠抓世界观的改造，狠抓自我批评，不断地进行自己思想上的兴无灭资的斗争。
    他对自己要求十分严格，对私心斗得特别狠，只要有了缺点，一经发现，就坦率承认，主动检查，坚决纠正。更可贵的是他做了好事之后，仍能按照毛主席的教导，高标准，严要求。有这样一个故事：
    一九六三年冬的一天，深夜一点多钟，卫生员熊志毅带哨回来，见到三班的灯还亮着。心想，刘英俊是十二点下的哨，可能是他还没睡吧？就轻轻地推开门走了进去。只见他伏在桌子上正在学习《纪念白求恩》。熊志毅说：“一个小时都过去了，你怎么还不睡呀？”刘英俊笑容满面地说：“不行呀！不学习毛主席著作就会迷失方向，不知道为谁当兵，当个什么样的兵，为谁工作，怎样做好工作。”原来，我们连的马房，有个窗子破了。刘英俊发现后没有及时给堵上。直到这次下哨时，他看见风雪直往里灌，才找块板子给钉上。熊志毅说：“钉上了不就很好吗？”刘英俊却说：“不能这样说，毛主席不是说了嘛，‘白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任……。’而我呢？现在才想起堵这个洞，这不正是缺乏这种极端负责的精神吗！”
    毛主席教导我们，学习革命理论是为了革命实践的需要，“你要知道革命的理论和方法，你就得参加革命”；“要改造那些把理论与实践、学习与工作完全脱节的现象，这样来更加坚定自己的阶级立场、党的立场与党性”。刘英俊同志正是这样。他学习毛主席著作，勇于实践，坚持为革命而学，为革命而用，在革命斗争中学，在革命斗争中用。他把理论和实践完全结合起来，把改造主观世界和改造客观世界完全结合起来。
    “鱼靠水，瓜靠秧，革命战士的成长，全靠伟大的毛泽东思想。”刘英俊同志，正是因为用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，所以在他牺牲的时候，尽管只有二十一岁，却已经成为毛主席所说的，一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。从他日记的许多话中，我们可以看到，他在世界观的改造上已经达到了很高的境界。他说：
    “真正的共产主义者是摆脱了小‘我’的束缚的人，他们的心目之中只有革命的利益，集体的利益，只要是对革命对集体有利的事，他们就积极的干，从不计较名誉和地位，也毫不考虑别人会怎样议论自己。他们是人类中最高尚的人，白求恩就是这样的人。……我一定以白求恩为榜样，……永远作革命的先锋。”
    “要革命就要斗争，害怕斗争就必然不敢革命。对于我们无产阶级革命者来说，我们的一切都献给了共产主义的革命事业，除了参加革命斗争以外，还有什么比这更大的幸福呢？”
    “生为革命生，死为革命死，一切为了革命，革命高于一切。”
    他还说：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重，为人民利益而活着的人，也比那泰山还重。”我们用这两句话来评价他的一生，是完全恰当的。
    他胸怀中国革命和世界革命。每当毛主席发表关于支持各国人民反帝革命斗争的声明，他都积极响应，明确地表示自己的态度。
    他在日记中多次表示随时准备支援世界革命的坚定决心。他说：“我一定按毛主席的指示执行，坚决站在反帝、反修斗争的最前线，作一个爱国主义和国际主义的先锋。”
    现在，美帝国主义把侵略越南的战争上升到了一个新的更严重的阶段。刘少奇主席发表声明，庄严地宣告：中国七亿人民，是越南人民的坚强后盾。中国辽阔的国土，是越南人民的可靠后方。为了支持越南人民夺取抗美战争的彻底胜利，中国人民准备承担最大的民族牺牲。我们要学习刘英俊同志的国际主义精神，随时准备响应祖国的召唤，和越南人民并肩战斗，共同打击美国侵略者。
    真心实意为人民
    毛主席教导我们：“一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事，一贯的有益于广大群众，一贯的有益于青年，一贯的有益于革命，艰苦奋斗几十年如一日，这才是最难最难的呵！”
    刘英俊同志坚决按照毛主席这一指示办事。他把为人民服务的宏大志愿和踏踏实实、一点一滴地做有益于集体、有利于人民的事情完全结合起来，在为人民服务的具体实践中，不断提高了自己的阶级觉悟。
    他做好事，有两个最鲜明的特点：
    一是具有明确的阶级观点。
    他对贫下中农怀有最深厚的阶级感情。每次外出野营，他到一个新的驻地，都要先做社会调查，把谁家是贫下中农，谁家是烈属、军属都了解得一清二楚。然后，才去帮助他们干活。他在营区附近群众当中做好事，也是这样。一次，连队外出生产，他看到一家老贫农只有老两口子，都六十来岁了，生活上有些困难。他不嫌脏，不嫌累，几乎每天都去帮助挑水，扫院子。他说：“你别看他家里不干净，可他的心最干净。咱们是贫农的儿子，贫农有困难，咱们就应该关心。”快到冬天了，他又起早贪黑给老两口子挖了一个菜窑。连队离开那里的时候，老大娘含着眼泪对连长说：“这孩子对咱贫下中农可真亲啊！”
    他做好事的第二个特点，是真心实意，扎扎实实，丝毫没有一点显示自己的意思。
  他经常在佳木斯市佳西区三十七委一带为群众做好事，帮助这家买粮，帮助那家挑水。时间越久，他做的好事越多，群众也越喜欢他。可是直到他牺牲了，大家才知道他叫刘英俊。军属刘大爷双手捧着刘英俊同志的遗象，热泪盈眶地说：“孩子！你的真名瞒了大爷一辈子啊！”还有一位老大娘说：“他学的毛主席著作全装到脑子里去了，他为人民服务，真是铁心啦！”
    去年春节前的几天，佳木斯市佳西商店非常繁忙。刘英俊和其他十几名同志一起来到这里帮助售货。刘英俊被分配到家具组的露天摊床上卖货。那时天很冷，下着小雪，刮着西北风。刘英俊同志整天站在那里热心为顾客服务。有一位农民来买炕席，刘英俊同志热心帮助他挑了一领最称心的，还给他捆了起来。刘英俊看他拿着冻手，又给他拴了一条绳子，说：“这样，你可以背着走，既方便，又不冻手。”农民感激地说：“你想得太周到啦，谢谢你。”
    刘英俊同志牺牲以后，部队同志和群众普遍回忆了他生前做的大量好事。大家说，他两只手从来不闲着。在宿舍里，有他制做的毛主席语录板、书架，修理的门窗和桌椅；在操场上，有他修理的篮球架，编织的篮球网，挖的排水沟；在俱乐部里，有他修的黑板，布置的学习园地，写的标语；在炊事房里，有他修理的锅灶和其它炊事用具……他做的好事是无法用数字来形容的。他在医院里休养，帮助重病号打水、端饭，协助医院工作人员扫地、刷厕所，是“劳动休养员”。他在旅途中，扶老携幼，忙这忙那，从不休息，是“义务列车员”。
    他做了这么多好事，从来都不留名，不向领导和同志讲，不在日记里记载。这些好事，大都是在业余时间，也就是反革命分子邓拓在他的“燕山黑话”里提出的所谓“生命的三分之一”的时间里做的。他无时不是为革命，无时不是为人民。他的所作所为，充分表现了一个无产阶级革命战士不为名、不为利、真心实意为人民的崇高品质。
    突出政治坚定不移
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。政治工作是我军的生命线。刘英俊同志坚决执行这个指示。
    一九六四年，正当有些人受到单纯军事观点影响，产生了忽视政治的倾向时，刘英俊同志毫不动摇地把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，抵制了军事对政治的冲击。
    当时，他被调到炮兵集训队学习。参加集训的绝大多数同志，都是炮连的正、副班长，军事技术比较熟练，刘英俊由驭手刚当炮手不久，学习当中有不少的困难。可是，他认为“上级叫我来集训，是为了接毛泽东思想的班，接无产阶级革命事业的班”。所以他天天坚持活学活用毛主席著作。
    一天下午，刘英俊在和同他一起来的一名班长制订“一帮一、一对红”活动计划时，两个人发生了争论。
    对方认为：刘英俊军事基础较差，星期天应该抓紧时间复习军事课目。
    刘英俊认为：星期天，应该多学习毛主席著作和做好事。
    对方说：“集训课目排得很紧，你又跟不上趟，还是利用星期天来补课吧！”
    刘英俊说：“补课，首先要补思想上的课。活学活用毛主席著作是最重要的课。只要我们把学习毛主席著作放在首位，脑子里有了毛泽东思想，军事技术是完全可以学好的！”
    刘英俊坚持这样做下去，表现了对突出政治的很高的自觉性。到集训结束时，他的思想觉悟有了新的提高，军事技术也取得了很好的成绩。
    刘英俊十分关心连队的政治思想建设，经常向领导上提出建议，并且自动做了许多政治思想工作。
    一九六三年冬天，刘英俊在三班当战士，他经常向班长建议，要组织大家带着问题活学活用毛主席著作。有个时期，班里学习毛主席著作联系实际不够，刘英俊就向班长金万民说：“班长：我向你提条意见。我看咱们班学习毛主席著作，方法上有问题。你得注意同志们的思想状况，针对班里的活思想组织学习。首先读文章，再联系个人的思想实际讨论提高，最后在实践中检查学习效果。班里要树榜样，促使大家学得更好，用得更好。”
    一九六五年，刘英俊同志到卫生队休养。他把班里的毛主席著作学习挂在心上，念念不忘。当班长因为训练忙，没有工夫去看他，打电话问他病情时，他却首先关切地问：“班长，咱们班最近学习毛主席著作都很好吧？”他还向班长说：“我一定好好学习毛主席著作，保证不掉队！”
    刘英俊在开展连队文化活动中，反复学习了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，坚决贯彻执行了毛主席关于文艺为无产阶级政治服务的方针，被同志们称为连队文化革命战线上的尖兵。他向连长提出：“咱们连队演唱组虽然净编小节目，演小节目，可小节目要有大方向啊！”他画了大量幻灯片，紧密地配合了连队政治思想教育。新战士入伍时，他画了《毛主席的好战士——雷锋》；阶级教育时，他画了《苦难的家史》；形势教育时，他画了《南方来信》、《阮文追》、《美帝罪行录》。仅从去年三月以来，他就编写和改编了十多个文艺节目，画了二十三部幻灯片，出了六十多期黑板报，热情地歌颂党和毛主席的英明领导，歌颂社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，歌颂毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物。
    《解放军报》在号召全军向刘英俊同志学习的社论里说过：“一个同志，不管他担任什么职务，只要他能够象刘英俊同志那样，真正把毛主席的书当作一切工作的最高指示，当作辨别一切是非的最高标准，他就能站得高，看得远，在任何情况下都突出无产阶级政治，在任何时候都不迷失方向。”从刘英俊的模范事迹当中，我们更加深刻地体会到，如果我们每个干部、战士，都能象他那样坚持突出政治的方向，那么，突出政治，就一定会有最广泛的群众基础，也就有了最可靠的保证。
    把传播毛泽东思想当作毕生事业
    毛主席教导说：“我们应当努力在工人阶级中宣传社会主义和共产主义”。刘英俊同志用实际行动响应了这个号召。他利用多种机会，通过多种渠道，采取多种方式，积极热情地宣传毛泽东思想，启发、鼓励连队的同志，家乡的亲友，学校的教师和学生，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
    刘英俊在开展连队文化活动中，通过编节目，写标语，创作诗歌，出黑板报，领唱革命歌，朗读革命书等，热情地宣传毛泽东思想。他每画一部幻灯片、搞一个节目，都要首先学习毛主席的有关论述，即使在任务重时间紧的情况下，也不例外。他画的幻灯片，在开头和结尾的地方，都引上了毛主席的话。他说，我们要让同志们“随时随地听到毛主席的话”。
    刘英俊以最大的革命热情，组织和帮助连队同志学习毛主席著作。他常说：“革命是大家的事，有你一分，也有我一分。一个人不学习毛主席著作，就少一分革命的力量，这就不是一个人的事啦！”
    一九六五年，韩少英从新兵连分配到炮连当战士。当天晚上，刘英俊便和他结成了“一帮一、一对红”。他对韩少英说：“咱们都是革命战士，当好一名战士最重要的是读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。”说着，就和他一起学习了《为人民服务》这篇文章。韩少英在连队九天，他耐心帮助了九天。还有个战士叫段天安，来部队的时候不识字，刘英俊一面帮他学习毛主席著作，一面教他认字。段天安在他帮助下，更热爱毛主席的书，慢慢地也能自学一些文章了。
    刘英俊为了让大家都能按照毛泽东思想办事，还精心地制做了两块毛主席语录板，挂在三班的墙壁上。他隔几天就换一条语录。一年来，刘英俊同志先后选写了毛主席有关阶级斗争、为人民服务、人民战争、批评与自我批评、艰苦朴素、团结等语录一百多条，及时地帮助班里解决了现实思想问题，有力地促进了大家的思想革命化。
    刘英俊同志把书信往来，看作是宣传毛泽东思想的重要渠道。他写信时，常常在信封上写一条毛主席语录，使收信人第一眼就看到毛主席的教导。他多次写信给同志、朋友和同学，介绍活学活用毛主席著作的体会。他听说表妹到农村参加社会主义教育运动，立即邮寄给她一本《毛主席语录》，还在语录本上写上“眼观金书跟党走”，要她“多学毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，指导自己的思想和行动。”
    刘英俊有个同学叫田瑞莲，因病退学在家。一九六六年春节期间，刘英俊请假探家看到了她。谈话中，她提到想留在城市工作。刘英俊说：“工业战线需要人，农业战线更需要人，依我看，还是到祖国最需要的地方去吧！农业劳动是比较艰苦，我们青年人应该挑重担子。”田瑞莲想了想，说：“你放心吧，我服从祖国需要就是了。”
    刘英俊回到部队以后，还放心不下，又一连两次写信，鼓励田瑞莲立志务农，“把一颗红心交给党，党叫干啥就干啥。”
    三月十二日，也就是刘英俊同志英勇牺牲的前三天，他再次写信，劝田瑞莲在农村扎根。信上他引用了毛主席关于知识分子工农化的教导，勉励田瑞莲读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，听从党的分配，立志建设社会主义新农村。
    田瑞莲看了这封充满毛泽东思想的来信，下定决心到农业战线上去。她还象刘英俊同志那样，热情地帮助另外三名同学，说服家庭，同她一起到农村去参加农业生产劳动。
    刘英俊同志非常关心少年儿童的成长，用毛泽东思想教育孩子们朝着红色接班人的方向前进。他生前是佳木斯市永安小学的校外辅导员，第一次给小朋友们讲话，就讲读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好孩子。他看见有的小朋友画“包公”，就说：“红色少年应该画红色英雄。”他看见有的小朋友在看小人书《追鱼》，就说：“红色少年应该看红色书籍。”他还特地买了十多本宣传革命英雄人物的连环画，送给小朋友们。他觉得，对小朋友们的教育，同样要突出政治，突出毛泽东思想。因此，他建议他辅导的班级的老师，对孩子加强革命思想的教育。他说：“对学生的政治思想教育是培养学生的一个重要方面”，“是工作的纲”。他还向学校老师宣传林彪同志关于活学活用毛主席著作的原则，希望他们努力学习毛主席著作。
    当他因公执勤或因病住院不能到学校来辅导的时候，他就通过书信来开展工作。他生前曾给学校老师和小朋友们，写过很多信。有两封信，一封是晚上十点三十分写完的，一封是晚上十点四十七分写完的。
    刘英俊宣传毛泽东思想，不放过任何时机。去年六月，刘英俊在佳木斯纺织厂子弟中学打球，认识了一名学生。这位学生后来当了营业员。他开始对这项工作认识不足，觉得“低气”，见了同学连头都不敢抬。刘英俊同志知道后，就热情地帮他学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装他的头脑，使这个青年提高了阶级觉悟，提高了服务质量。
    刘英俊同志越是从自己的体验中，认识到干革命离不开毛泽东思想，越是迫切地希望别人都能掌握毛泽东思想。他真是把传播毛泽东思想当作了自己毕生的战斗任务！我们一定要以他为榜样，把伟大的毛泽东思想传遍全中国，传遍全世界！
    勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想
    刘英俊同志在阶级斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，又用毛泽东思想指导自己在阶级斗争中的实践。他立场坚定，嗅觉灵敏。不仅对于帝国主义的武装进犯，而且对于国内外阶级敌人的“和平演变”的阴谋，始终保持着高度的警惕。对于那些反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的谬论，他更保持了无产阶级革命战士应有的警觉，一经识破，就积极战斗，坚决反击，勇敢地捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想。
    他有一本《关于胡风反革命集团的材料》。他经常把它拿出来看，并且建议副班长也来阅读。这本材料的序言和《人民日报》社论中指出，我们不仅要善于辨别在正常情况下从事活动的好人和坏人，还要善于辨别在特殊情况下从事活动的某些人们。“我们还必须深刻认识，只要我们革命队伍的成员在政治上麻痹大意，对反革命丧失警惕，那就会提供这些反革命分子以进行活动的条件。”他对这些话特别重视，在上面画上了道道。
    一九六四年十二月，他看了资产阶级“权威”冯定在《共产主义人生观》一书中散布污蔑毛泽东思想的“正义冲动论”，心中非常的愤怒。他立刻写了一篇文章，严厉地驳斥冯定的反动谬论。
    这篇文章，把冯定的修正主义谬论，驳得体无完肤，揭得原形毕露，再一次证明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，觉悟最高、嗅觉最灵、斗志最旺，什么牛鬼蛇神都能看得清，什么“权威”“学者”，只要他们反对毛泽东思想，都敢于和他们拚，敢于和他们斗！
    一九六四年冬，正当社会上有些牛鬼蛇神大肆吹捧《兵临城下》，说什么它“激发了人们的斗志”、“鼓舞了人们的革命的热情”的时候，刘英俊一眼就看穿了它的反动本质。他就在群众当中批判这部坏影片。一九六五年，他又在同连长的谈话中，尖锐地指出：“那个电影既不符合毛主席的文艺路线，又不符合毛主席的军事思想，方向不对头！”在看了小说《苦斗》之后，他也写文章，严肃地指出这是一部反毛泽东思想的坏小说。
    他一生念念不忘阶级斗争，就在他牺牲前不久，还自动组织班里同志，学习了姚文元同志批判吴晗反党反社会主义罪行的文章：《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》。我们大家一致感到，刘英俊真称得上是一个勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想的战斗员。
    刘英俊同志英勇牺牲以后，我们全连热烈地开展了向刘英俊同志学习的活动。大家学习了刘英俊生前学得最多的“老三篇”，阅读了刘英俊给我们留下的最珍贵的日记，回忆了刘英俊的光辉事迹，进行了自我革命。每个干部战士都下定决心，学习刘英俊忠于党、忠于人民、忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的崇高品质。千好万好，首先要把毛主席著作学习好，大事小事，一切都按毛泽东思想办事。人人努力，做一个真正突出政治的无产阶级革命战士。
    全连同志积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，决心以刘英俊为榜样，把阶级觉悟提得高高的，把眼睛擦得亮亮的，把嗅觉搞得灵灵的，在党的领导下，同全国人民一道，彻底打垮资产阶级的猖狂进攻，勇敢地捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想。
    我们一定要永远牢记党的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗；读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！把我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业引向一个又一个新的伟大的胜利！
