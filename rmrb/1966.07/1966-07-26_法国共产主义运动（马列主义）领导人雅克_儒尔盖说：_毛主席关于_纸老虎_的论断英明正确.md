French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist) Secretariat Secretary Jacques Jurquet, in his political report delivered at the end of June at the first congress of this organization, enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought.

He pointed out that the great victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation has confirmed Chairman Mao's theory of people's war and his brilliant judgment that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers."

The political report, published in the July-August combined issue of the central organ of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist), *La Nouvelle Critique*, states in the section "The Criminal Aggression of U.S. Imperialism Against Vietnam":

"The Vietnamese people will be victorious because they are waging a people's revolutionary war. Ultimately, as Comrade Mao Zedong has taught us, and as the Vietnamese comrades led by the respected Comrade Ho Chi Minh have already successfully demonstrated, the decisive factor is man, man will ultimately triumph over seemingly powerful material forces. It is in this sense that we must understand Mao Zedong's famous judgment: 'Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.'"

"From this viewpoint, the aggressive war that U.S. imperialism is currently waging in Vietnam will inevitably become a decisive example of the great leap forward in the world revolution."

In discussing the section "We must concretely analyze the situation of the various classes in French society," Jurquet emphasized the need to draw lessons from Chairman Mao's writings on class struggle and class analysis to concretely analyze the situation of the various classes in French society, in order to formulate the correct line, policy, and strategy for class struggle.

He said: "In our country, under the conditions of the era when the various monopoly (capital) groups are increasingly tightening their rule, it is an indispensable prerequisite for us to determine our strategic line on the basis of the correct line of class struggle, that we concretely analyze the situation of the various classes in French society." He pointed out, "We must draw lessons from the methods adopted by Comrade Mao Zedong in 'Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society' and 'Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan.'"

In discussing the section "Our internal problems: eliminating our mistakes and shortcomings," Jurquet praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently being carried out in China and the Chinese Communist Party's policy of combining intellectuals with workers and peasants.

    法国共产主义运动（马列主义）领导人雅克·儒尔盖说：
    毛主席关于“纸老虎”的论断英明正确
    据新华社巴黎二十二日电　法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）书记处书记雅克·儒尔盖六月底在这个组织的第一次代表大会上所作的政治报告中热烈赞颂毛泽东思想。
    他指出，越南人民抗美救国斗争的伟大胜利证实了毛主席关于人民战争的学说，以及“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断。
    登载在法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）中央机关报《新人道报》七、八月份合刊上的这个政治报告在“美帝国主义对越南的罪恶侵略”这一部分中写道：“越南人民必胜，因为他们在进行一场人民革命战争，因为归根结蒂，正如毛泽东同志所教导的那样，正如以尊敬的胡志明同志为首的越南同志已经胜利地证实的那样，决定性的因素是人，人终将战胜表面上强大的物质力量。正是在这个意义上，我们必须理解毛泽东这一著名论断：‘帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎’。
    “从这个观点来看，美帝国主义目前在越南进行的这场侵略战争，今后必然是世界革命大飞跃的决定性实例。”
    雅克·儒尔盖在谈到“必须具体分析法国社会各阶级的情况”这一部分时强调要从毛主席著作中关于阶级斗争和阶级分析的论述中汲取教益，来具体分析法国社会各阶级的状况，以便制订正确的阶级斗争的路线、方针和策略。
    他说：“根据我国的条件，在阶级斗争的正确方针的基础上确定我们的策略路线的必不可少的前提是，在各垄断（资本）集团日益加紧独霸的统治的时代，我们要具体分析法国社会各阶级的情况。”他指出，“我们必须从毛泽东同志在《中国社会各阶级的分析》和《湖南农民运动考察报告》里所采取的方法中汲取教益。”
    雅克·儒尔盖在谈到“我们内部的问题：消除我们的错误和缺点”这一部分时赞扬中国目前正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命运动，和中国共产党关于知识分子同工农相结合的政策。
