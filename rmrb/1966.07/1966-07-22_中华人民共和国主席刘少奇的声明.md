Statement by Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the People's Republic of China

I represent the 700 million people of China in solemnly declaring to the world that the Chinese people and the Chinese government resolutely and enthusiastically support the statement made by Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on July 17 to the people of the entire nation.

In this magnificent document, Chairman Ho Chi Minh once again declares the Vietnamese people's determination to wage a protracted struggle. Strike down, strike to the end, until the American aggressors are completely and thoroughly driven out of Vietnam, and final victory is achieved—this is the Vietnamese people's powerful response to the American imperialists' escalation of their war of aggression to a new and more serious stage.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh has exposed the American "peace talks" deception. The United States must stop its war of aggression against Vietnam and withdraw all its troops and the troops of its accomplices from Vietnam. Only then will peace be immediately restored. This is a direct blow to the American imperialists' "bombing for peace" conspiracy. It is also a warning to those who conspire with American imperialism to create the "peace talks" deception.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh's statement is a call to battle, a call to unity, and a call to victory. The 31 million people of Vietnam, north and south, men, women, and children, are being widely mobilized and will certainly deal the American imperialists even heavier blows. All actions taken and to be taken by the Vietnamese people are their sacred right. All countries and peoples in the world who are anti-imperialist and revolutionary stand on the side of the Vietnamese people. All actions taken to support and aid the Vietnamese people are just.

China is a socialist country armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Proletarian internationalism is the highest guiding principle of our foreign policy. We have always condemned nationalism that betrays the interests of the revolutionary peoples of the world. Supporting the just struggle of all oppressed nations and peoples against imperialism and its lackeys is our international duty. Supporting our Vietnamese comrades in their struggle against American imperialist aggression is a duty and obligation for the Chinese people.

We warn the American aggressors: do not miscalculate, do not misjudge your opponent. To support the Vietnamese people in achieving a complete victory in their war of resistance against America, the Chinese people are prepared to make the greatest national sacrifices.

Since you have torn up the 1954 Geneva Accords, the Chinese government and people, in supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation, are no longer bound by the Geneva Accords.

Since you have, through your acts of aggression, completely shattered the boundary between North and South Vietnam, the Chinese government and people's support and aid to the Vietnamese people are, of course, even less bound by any restrictions or limitations.

If you think you can escalate your war of aggression without suffering the appropriate punishment, then you will regret it.

The Chinese government reaffirms that American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam is aggression against China. The 700 million people of China are the staunch backers of the Vietnamese people. The vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people have made up their minds and are fully prepared to take whatever actions deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam, to jointly strike at the American aggressors at any time and in any place.

The peoples of China and Vietnam are socialist brother countries that are inseparable. The fighting friendship and solid unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam are the most reliable guarantee for defeating the American aggressors.

The Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation is just, and a just cause is bound to win. The American war of aggression is unjust, and an unjust war is bound to fail.

Long live the victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation against American aggression!

    新华社二十二日讯　中华人民共和国主席刘少奇的声明
                          （一九六六年七月二十二日）
    我代表七亿中国人民，向全世界庄严声明，中国人民和中国政府最坚决地、最热烈地支持越南民主共和国主席胡志明七月十七日发表的《告全国同胞书》。
    胡志明主席在这个气壮山河的文件中，再一次宣告了越南人民坚持长期抗战的决心。打下去，打到底，直到把美国侵略者全部彻底赶出越南，取得最后胜利，这就是越南人民对美帝国主义把侵略战争上升到一个新的更严重的阶段的有力回答。
    胡志明主席揭露了美国的“和谈”骗局。美国必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须把美国军队和它的帮凶军全部撤出越南，这样，和平就会立即恢复。这是对美帝国主义“以炸迫和”阴谋的一个迎头痛击。对于那些同美帝国主义合谋制造“和谈”骗局的牛鬼蛇神，也是当头一棒。
    胡志明主席的文告，是战斗的号召，团结的号召，胜利的号召。全越南三千一百万人民，不分南方北方，不分男女老幼，正在广泛地动员起来，必将给美帝国主义更加沉重的打击。越南人民已经采取的和将要采取的一切战斗行动，都是自己的神圣权利。全世界一切反帝革命的国家和人民，都站在越南人民这一边。他们所采取的一切支持和援助越南人民的行动，都是正义的。
    中国是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的社会主义国家。无产阶级国际主义是我国对外政策的最高指导原则。我们一贯谴责背叛世界革命人民利益的民族沙文主义和民族利己主义。支持全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的正义斗争，是我国人民的国际义务。支持兄弟的越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略，中国人民更是责无旁贷，义不容辞。
    我们要正告美国侵略者，你们不要打错了算盘，看错了对象。为了支持越南人民夺取抗美战争的彻底胜利，中国人民准备承担最大的民族牺牲。
    你们既然把一九五四年日内瓦协议撕得粉碎，中国政府和中国人民在支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争上，当然不再受日内瓦协议的约束。
    你们既然已经用侵略战争的行动，彻底打破了越南南方和北方的界限，中国政府和中国人民对越南人民的支持和援助，当然就更加不受任何约束和限制。
    如果你们以为自己可以肆无忌惮地把侵略战争“升级”，而不会遭到应有的惩罚，那么，你们将要后悔莫及。
    中国政府重申，美帝国主义对越南的侵略，就是对中国的侵略。中国七亿人民，是越南人民的坚强后盾。中国辽阔的国土，是越南人民的可靠后方。中国人民下定了决心，做好了各种准备，随时随地采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动，共同打击美国侵略者。
    中越两国是唇齿相依的社会主义兄弟国家。中越两国人民的战斗友谊和坚强团结，是战胜美国侵略者的最可靠的保证。
    越南人民抗美救国的斗争是正义的，正义的事业是必胜的。美国的侵略战争是不义的，不义的战争是必败的。
    越南人民抗美救国战争胜利万岁！
