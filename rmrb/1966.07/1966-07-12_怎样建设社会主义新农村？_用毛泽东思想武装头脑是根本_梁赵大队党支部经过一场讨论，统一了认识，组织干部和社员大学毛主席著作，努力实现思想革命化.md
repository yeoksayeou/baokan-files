How to Build a Socialist New Countryside?
Arming the Mind with Mao Zedong Thought is Fundamental

The Party Branch of Liangzhao Production Brigade held an expanded meeting recently to discuss an important issue: "In building a socialist new countryside, what should be the main focus and how should it be built?"

The entire cadre and community members of Liangzhao Production Brigade, through nearly a year of socialist education and class struggle, have significantly improved their socialist consciousness by studying Chairman Mao's works. Everyone has set high aspirations and resolved to completely change the backward appearance of Liangzhao and build it into a socialist new countryside. However, there was confusion about what exactly should be built and how. To address this, the brigade's Party Branch held a special meeting to discuss and formulate a plan for building the new countryside.

During the discussion, everyone shared their opinions and plans, leading to debates. Some said: Building a socialist new countryside ultimately comes down to producing more grain, increasing income, and improving living standards. The Party Branch of Liangzhao Production Brigade should focus on mechanizing farming, water conservancy, and electrification, and developing diversified operations. These are fundamental measures for increasing production and income and building a socialist new countryside. If we accelerate these efforts and achieve mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification, along with diversified operations, the socialist new countryside will meet the standards. However, the majority disagreed with this view. They said: Building a socialist new countryside first and foremost requires ideological construction. Studying Chairman Mao's works and arming the mind with Mao Zedong Thought is fundamental. Without transforming people's thinking and raising socialist awareness, even if production and construction achievements are great and grain production is high, it will lead to a wealthy life but a poor mind, causing a capitalist restoration. With Mao Zedong Thought and people's ideological transformation, there will be no worries about mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification, nor about increasing grain production and income. Therefore, they believed that the approach of focusing on material things without considering people and ideology is very dangerous. It is crucial to seriously study Chairman Mao's works and focus on people's ideological transformation to build a solid foundation for the socialist new countryside.

After initial discussions, these two opposing views were clarified. The Party Branch recognized the importance of this issue, which relates to the direction of rural production and construction, the revolutionization of peasants, and preventing capitalist restoration in rural areas. Therefore, it was decided to further discuss this issue.

During the discussion, some still believed that peasants engaging in production is engaging in revolution. They insisted that "with grain, everything is settled." However, the majority disagreed, saying: Developing agricultural production must be led by Mao Zedong Thought. Without studying Chairman Mao's books and ideological transformation, relying solely on technical measures and material conditions, even if production is pushed forward, it will be like a rabbit's tail—it won't grow long and may revert or even take a capitalist path. Through in-depth discussion, everyone agreed: Building a socialist new countryside requires striving for mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification, but more importantly, it requires transforming ideology and achieving ideological revolutionization, prioritizing ideological construction. Among some peasants, there are still remnants of selfish and individualistic thoughts from the old society, making it easy to develop capitalist tendencies. Therefore, the rural Party Branch must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, continuously do political work, and instill socialist ideology in the community members, criticizing capitalist tendencies. It is not allowed to be misled by immediate interests and busy production and construction tasks, reversing the priorities by emphasizing production and construction while neglecting political work and ideological revolutionization.

How to achieve ideological revolutionization? The cadres and community members of this brigade said: The fundamental way is to study Chairman Mao's works and arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought. They regarded Chairman Mao's works as their lifeline and Mao Zedong Thought as the eternal red sun in their hearts. They resolved to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to wage class struggle between the two roads and two ideologies, fighting both class enemies like landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and the "self" and "private" in their own thoughts, eliminating capitalist tendencies and establishing a completely and thoroughly revolutionary ideology.

After this discussion, the Party Branch of Liangzhao Brigade, based on the ideological situation of cadres and community members, studied and implemented specific measures to organize the community to study Chairman Mao's works and achieve ideological revolutionization. The leading cadres took the lead, actively studying, and creating a fervor for actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the brigade.

　　怎样建设社会主义新农村？
　　用毛泽东思想武装头脑是根本
    梁赵大队党支部经过一场讨论，统一了认识，组织干部和社员大学毛主席著作，努力实现思想革命化
    新华社太原九日电山西省平遥县达蒲公社梁赵生产大队党支部最近召开支部扩大会议，讨论了这样一个重要问题：“建设社会主义新农村，主要应该建设什么，怎样建设？”
    梁赵生产大队的全体干部和社员，在近一年的社会主义教育运动中，经过阶级斗争的锻炼，大学毛主席著作，社会主义思想觉悟有了很大提高，人人树雄心立壮志，决心要把梁赵的落后面貌彻底改变过来，建设成为社会主义的新农村。但是，究竟应该建设什么和怎样建设，大家不明白。为了解决这个问题，大队党支部便专门开会讨论，让大家出谋献策，制定新农村的建设规划。
    在讨论的时候，大家谈了自己的看法和打算，发生了争论。一部分人说：建设社会主义新农村，归根到底，无非是多打粮食，增加收入，让大家过好日子。梁赵大队党支部应当狠抓耕作机械化、农田水利化和电气化，发展多种经营。这些都是增产增收、建设社会主义新农村的根本措施。只要快马加鞭，实现机械化、水利化和电气化，又发展了多种经营，社会主义新农村就够标准了。但是，多数人不同意这个主张。他们说：建设社会主义的新农村，首先是思想建设，学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，才是根本。人的思想不改造，没有社会主义觉悟，即使生产建设成绩再大，打的粮食再多，结果会富了生活，穷了思想，使资本主义复辟。有了毛泽东思想，有了人的思想革命化，便不愁机械化、水利化和电气化，不愁粮食增产和收入增加。因此他们认为，那种见物不见人、不见思想的打算和做法是很危险的，应该认真学毛主席著作，把主要力量放在人的思想革命化上面才是保险的。这样，社会主义的新农村就可以建立在牢不可破的基础上。
    经过初步讨论，这两种截然不同的想法和打算摆明以后，党支部认识到，这个问题十分重要，它关系到农村生产建设走什么道路、农民如何革命化，以及如何在农村防止资本主义复辟的大事。因此决定对这个问题进一步展开讨论。
    在讨论中，有一部分人说：农民闹生产就是闹革命。他们仍然认为“有了粮食就有了一切”。大多数人不同意这种说法，他们说：发展农业生产，必须毛泽东思想挂帅。不读毛主席的书，思想没有革命化，光凭一些技术措施和物质条件，生产即使抓上去，也是“兔子尾巴——长不了”，会走回头路，甚至走上资本主义邪路。经过深入讨论，大家一致认识到：建设社会主义的新农村，需要努力实现机械化、水利化和电气化，但是更重要的是要改造思想，实现思想革命化，首先搞好思想建设。在有些农民当中，现在还有着旧社会遗留下来的自私自利的思想，很容易产生资本主义的自发倾向。因此，农村党支部必须遵照毛主席的教导，经常做好政治工作，向社员群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义的自发倾向。决不能被眼前利益和生产建设任务忙等现象所迷惑，本末倒置地强调生产建设而忽视政治工作，忽视思想革命化。
    怎样实现人的思想革命化呢？这个大队的干部和社员都说：根本的办法是读毛主席的书，用毛泽东思想武装起来。他们把毛主席著作当作命根子，把毛泽东思想当作心中永远不落的红太阳。他们决心活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想作武器，开展两条道路、两种思想的阶级斗争，一面与地、富、反、坏等阶级敌人斗，一面与自己思想上的“我”字、“私”字斗，兴无灭资，树立完全、彻底为革命的思想。
    经过这次讨论，梁赵大队党支部针对干部和社员的思想情况，研究落实了组织群众大学毛主席著作、实现思想革命化的具体措施。领导干部以身作则，积极带头学，在全大队形成了活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。
