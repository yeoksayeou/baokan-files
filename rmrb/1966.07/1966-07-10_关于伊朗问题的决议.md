Edition: 7

    Considering that the toiling and oppressed people of Iran—one of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America under colonial rule—have risen up against the puppet regime of the Shah and its master, imperialism, especially American imperialism,
    Noting that the Iranian regime is using every means—threats, intimidation, imprisonment, torture, and the death penalty—to suppress workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, and to ban all democratic organizations,
    Considering that the policy of this regime is to follow American and British imperialism, to supply oil to the puppet regime in Saigon without charge, to send nurses, to refuse to recognize the People's Republic of China, to conclude a bilateral treaty with the United States and join the Central Treaty Organization, and recently, in collaboration with the reactionary regime of Saudi Arabia, to become the initiator of another imperialist pact, the so-called Islamic Pact, and furthermore,
    Considering the fact that the Iranian regime is a regime that bows to American imperialists, despite its claims of reform and the maintenance of national independence, despite the fact that the separatists have close ties with the Iranian reactionary regime and conduct propaganda in its favor;
    We, the representatives of Asian and African countries attending the emergency conference in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism, held in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, from June 27 to July 9, 1966,
    Condemn the reactionary regime of Iran, the lackey of American imperialism; we believe that the military treaties concluded by the Iranian government with imperialism are against the interests of the Iranian people and the peoples of other countries in the Middle East; we condemn the Islamic Pact, which is a tool for imperialists to consolidate their reactionary positions in the Middle East and to do as they please; we believe that this pact is against the interests of the Iranian and Arab peoples.
    Support the revolutionary struggle of the Iranian people against colonialism, and firmly believe that the toiling people of Iran, who have been under colonial rule, with their valuable experience of many years of struggle against imperialism and domestic reactionaries, will quickly overthrow the reactionary regime and achieve victory in their struggle.

    关于伊朗问题的决议
    考虑到劳苦和被压迫的伊朗人民——亚洲、非洲及拉丁美洲在殖民统治下的人民中的一员——已经起来反对国王傀儡政权及其主子，帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，
    注意到伊朗政权正在使用一切手段——威胁、恐吓、监禁、酷刑和死刑——镇压工人、农民和革命知识分子，并取缔所有民主组织，
    考虑到这个政权的总政策是追随美英帝国主义，向西贡傀儡政权无偿供应石油，派遣护士，拒绝承认中华人民共和国，同美国缔结双边条约并参加中央条约组织，而且最近伙同沙特阿拉伯反动政权，成为另一个帝国主义条约，即所谓伊斯兰条约的倡议者，并且，
    考虑到这一事实，即伊朗政权是一个俯首屈从于美帝国主义者的政权，尽管它宣称改革和维护民族独立，尽管分裂主义者同伊朗反动政权有着密切关系并进行有利于这个政权的宣传；
    我们出席这次于一九六六年六月二十七日至七月九日在中华人民共和国首都北京举行的支援越南人民反对美帝国主义斗争的紧急会议的亚非国家的作家代表，
    谴责美帝国主义的走卒——伊朗的反动政权；我们认为伊朗政府与帝国主义订立的军事条约是违反伊朗人民和中东其他各国人民的利益的；我们谴责伊斯兰条约，这个条约是帝国主义者巩固他们在中东的反动阵地的工具，并且使帝国主义者能够为所欲为；我们认为这个条约违反伊朗和阿拉伯国家人民的利益。
    支持伊朗人民反对殖民主义的革命斗争，并且深信，受着殖民统治的伊朗劳苦人民，具有多年来同帝国主义和国内反动派斗争的宝贵经验，必将迅速地摧毁反动政权，取得斗争的胜利。
