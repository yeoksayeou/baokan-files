Fujian, Guangxi, and Jiangxi provinces have reported bumper early rice harvests. According to Xinhua News Agency, the double-cropping early rice in Fujian Province has been basically harvested, and the yield in the harvested areas is generally better than last year. The masses of commune members say: This year's good harvest of early rice is the result of studying Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

Since this spring's plowing, Fujian Province's rural areas have further launched a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The masses of cadres and commune members have further established the idea of "cultivating for the revolution," taking the people of Dazhai as an example, carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance, vigorously developing water conservancy, transforming low-yield fields, expanding the planting of green manure crops, and increasing the planting area of early rice compared to last year, laying the foundation for a significant increase in production. This year, the province has promoted more than five million mu of dwarf varieties of double-cropping early rice, more than double the area last year, achieving good results in increasing production. Some bourgeois "authorities" said: "The mountains are high and the water is cold in the mountainous areas, and it is not suitable to grow double-cropping rice." They also designated areas above 600 meters in altitude as "no-go zones" for double-cropping rice. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: Natural conditions can be transformed, and double-cropping rice definitely yields more than single-cropping rice. This year, many places have planted double-cropping rice in mountainous areas at altitudes of 800 to 900 meters, and the results are very good.

Leaders at all levels have taken Chairman Mao's works to the front lines, laboring and studying with the commune members, leading the commune members to reasonably arrange labor force and reform tools. Local government agencies, military units, factories, enterprises, and urban residents have also provided strong support for the summer harvest. Therefore, the summer harvest in the province has not only progressed quickly but has also generally achieved precise and meticulous harvesting.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the various ethnic minorities in Guangxi have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieved a good harvest of early rice. Now, early rice in various parts of Guangxi is successively ripening, and the southern regions of Yulin, Qinzhou, and parts of Nanning, Wuzhou, and Baise have successively entered the busy season of harvesting. Other regions have also started harvesting in succession.

To win the summer harvest and summer planting battle, the masses of commune members and cadres in various places have further launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, fearing no difficulties and dangers, and actively participating in the anti-flood and rescue harvesting battle, ensuring a good harvest of early rice, timely planting of late rice, and striving for a bumper harvest throughout the year.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jiangxi Province is successively harvesting early rice from south to north. The masses of cadres and people in the province have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively participated in the summer harvest and summer planting battle, determined to achieve double victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and agricultural production.

This year, the early and mid-season rice in this province are large, numerous, long, dense, and full. From the south of Jiangxi to the north, everywhere presents a scene of bumper harvests. Various places in the province, according to Chairman Mao's instruction of "not fighting a battle without preparation and not fighting a battle without confidence," have done sufficient preparations for rushing harvest and planting, determined to overcome difficulties and strive for victory.

    为革命而种田  以大寨作榜样
    福建广西江西喜报早稻丰收
    据新华社福州二十七日电　福建省双季早稻，已经基本收割完毕，已收地区的收成普遍比去年好。广大社员说：今年早稻获得好收成，是读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事的结果。
    今年春耕以来，福建省农村进一步掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。广大干部社员进一步树立了“为革命种田”的思想，以大寨人为榜样，发扬自力更生精神，大力兴修水利，改造低产田，扩种绿肥作物，早稻的种植面积也比去年大，为大幅度增产打下了基础。今年全省双季早稻推广了五百多万亩矮秆品种，比去年扩大一倍多，获得良好的增产效果。有的资产阶级“权威”说：“山区山高水冷，不宜种双季稻。”并且把海拔六百米以上的地区划为双季稻“禁区”。广大贫下中农说：自然条件可以改造，双季稻肯定比单季稻增产。今年许多地方已把双季稻种到海拔八九百米的山区，结果长得很好。
    各级领导干部纷纷带着毛主席著作到第一线，同社员一起劳动，一起学习，领导社员合理安排劳动力，改革工具。各地机关、部队、工厂、企业和城镇居民，也大力支援夏收。因此，全省夏收不仅进度快，而且普遍做到精打细收。
    据新华社南宁二十六日电　广西各族农民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，夺得了早稻的较好收成。现在，广西各地早稻相继黄熟，南部的玉林、钦州专区和南宁、梧州、百色专区的部分县已先后进入收割大忙，其他地区也陆续开始收割。
    为打好夏收夏种这一仗，各地广大社员和干部进一步掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，以毛泽东思想为武器，不怕困难，不畏艰险，积极投入抗洪抢收战斗，保证收好早稻，插好晚稻，争取全年丰收。
    据新华社南昌二十六日电　江西省由南到北陆续开镰收割早稻。全省广大干部和群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极投入夏收夏种战斗，决心夺取无产阶级文化大革命和农业生产的双胜利。
    今年，这个省的早、中稻长得兜大、穗多、穗长、粒密。从赣南到赣北，到处呈现出一派丰收景象。全省各地根据毛主席“不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗”的指示，进行了充分的抢收抢种的准备工作，下定决心，战胜困难，争取胜利。
