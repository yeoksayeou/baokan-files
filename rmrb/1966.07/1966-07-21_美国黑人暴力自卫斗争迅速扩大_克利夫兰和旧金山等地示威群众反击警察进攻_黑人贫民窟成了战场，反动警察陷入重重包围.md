	American blacks, fearing no violence, bravely engaged in violent self-defense struggles on the 18th and 19th in Cleveland, Ohio. Hundreds of blacks in Cleveland, shouting the slogan "Black Power," retaliated against the 400 fully armed police who came to suppress them with bricks, stones, and homemade Molotov cocktails. When the police opened fire on the black crowd, some armed blacks immediately retaliated. They fired back from dark windows and rooftops at the police who came to suppress them, turning a four-square-mile black slum into a battlefield. Hundreds of fully armed police were surrounded by the black crowd.

	On the 19th, Ohio Governor Rhodes ruthlessly ordered the deployment of more than 1,500 National Guardsmen to strengthen the suppression of blacks and declared Cleveland in a state of emergency. Just four days after the U.S. ruling authorities sent the National Guard to suppress blacks in Chicago, they again sent the National Guard to suppress blacks in Cleveland. This situation shows that the fighting spirit of American blacks is growing stronger.

	Cleveland is an industrial center in the northern United States, with about one-third of its one million residents being black. They are mostly crowded into the slums in the eastern part of the city, suffering from racial discrimination. Three weeks ago, blacks here had already launched a violent self-defense struggle.

	On the 19th, Harlem and Brooklyn in New York City also saw black violent self-defense struggles of varying scales against oppression.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 19th, after the powerful storm of violent self-defense struggles by blacks in Chicago had just passed, news of black anti-oppression struggles of varying scales broke out in a series of major American cities.

	On the evening of the 18th, in the northern industrial center of Cleveland, hundreds of black demonstrators (mostly youth) fought with the police who came to suppress them. This was the second armed anti-oppression struggle in this city in nearly a month. Black youth bravely confronted the fully armed police with bricks, stones, and homemade Molotov cocktails. The police opened fire on the crowd, and armed blacks immediately retaliated. A black female youth was killed by the police, but several police were also injured. On the same evening, in the southern city of Jacksonville (Florida), blacks also launched a violent self-defense struggle. About 300 black youth participating in an anti-discrimination, anti-persecution demonstration were provoked by white supremacists and violently suppressed by the police. Black demonstrators bravely fought back with bricks, stones, and homemade Molotov cocktails. The police's gunfire was met with black retaliation.

	Previously, on the night of the 17th, in South Bend, Indiana, about 120 kilometers south of Chicago, more than a hundred blacks fought with the police for nearly four hours. Demonstrating blacks retaliated against the police's attacks with fists, bricks, and stones, and repeatedly regrouped to continue marching and demonstrating towards the city center. On the evening of the 16th, in the black district of San Francisco, blacks also engaged in violent resistance against oppression. The authorities sent a large number of police, who openly fired at the blacks. The blacks bravely retaliated with homemade Molotov cocktails. In the struggle, one black person was shot in the abdomen, and seven blacks were arrested.

    美国黑人暴力自卫斗争迅速扩大
    克利夫兰和旧金山等地示威群众反击警察进攻
    黑人贫民窟成了战场，反动警察陷入重重包围
    据新华社二十日讯　华盛顿消息：美国俄亥俄州克利夫兰市的黑人不畏强暴，在十八日和十九日连续两天，展开英勇的暴力自卫斗争。
    克利夫兰市的数百名黑人在斗争中高呼“黑人要权力”的口号，用砖头、瓦块和自制燃烧瓶等，回击了前来镇压他们的四百名全副武装警察。当警察向黑人群众开枪行凶时，一些带枪的黑人立即予以回击，他们从黑暗的窗口，从屋顶上向前来镇压的警察射出复仇的子弹，使得四平方英里的黑人贫民窟成了一个战场，数百名全副武装的警察陷于黑人群众的重重包围之中。
    十九日，俄亥俄州州长罗兹悍然下令调一千五百多名国民警卫队加强对黑人的镇压，并宣布克利夫兰市处于紧急状态。在美国统治当局刚刚出动国民警卫队镇压芝加哥的黑人以后仅仅四天，又出动国民警卫队来镇压克利夫兰市的黑人。这种情况说明了美国黑人的斗争精神越来越旺。
    克利夫兰市是美国北部的工业中心，在一百万市民中约有三分之一是黑人，他们大多被迫挤在城市东部的贫民窟里，饱受种族歧视。在三个星期前，这里的黑人曾爆发过一次暴力自卫斗争。
    十九日，纽约市的哈莱姆区和布鲁克林区也爆发了规模不等的黑人反压迫的暴力自卫斗争。
    据新华社十九日讯　美国芝加哥市黑人掀起的暴力自卫斗争的强大风暴刚刚过去，从一系列美国大城市里又传来了爆发规模不等的黑人抗暴斗争的消息。
    十八日晚上，在北部工业中心克利夫兰，数百名黑人示威者（主要是青年）同前来镇压的警察进行了搏斗。这是近一个月来这个城市中爆发的第二次黑人武装抗暴斗争。黑人青年用砖头、瓦块和自制燃烧瓶奋勇迎击全副武装的警察。警察向群众开枪，带枪黑人立即给予还击。一名黑人女青年被警察杀害，但是警察也有多名被打伤。同一天晚上，在南部城市杰克逊维尔（佛罗里达州）也爆发了黑人的暴力自卫斗争。大约三百名举行反歧视、反迫害示威游行的黑人青年遭到了白人种族主义分子的挑衅和警察的暴力镇压。黑人示威者奋起用砖头、石块和自制燃烧瓶作武器迎战警察。警察开枪行凶遭到了黑人的还击。
    在这以前，十七日深夜，在芝加哥南一百二十公里的印第安纳州南本德市，百余名黑人也与警察展开了近四小时的搏斗。示威的黑人用拳头、砖头和石块反击警察的攻击，并且一再重新集合起来，坚持向市中心游行示威。十六日晚上，在旧金山黑人区也发生了黑人用暴力反抗压迫的斗争，当局出动了大批警察，并公然向黑人开枪射击，黑人英勇地用自制燃烧瓶作武器进行回击。在斗争中一名黑人的腹部被枪击伤，七名黑人被捕。
