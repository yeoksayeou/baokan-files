	Mountains and seas cannot block
	(Simplified Yi Folk Song)

	No matter how long the road is, it is cut off by a great river;
	No matter how long the mountain range is, it is cut off by the great sea;
	The great thought of Mao Zedong,
	Mountains cannot block, seas cannot hinder.
	Every word shines brightly,
	Spreading across the five lakes and four seas, and over ten thousand rivers and a thousand mountains,
	Illuminating the hearts of all ethnic groups!

    高山大海隔不断
    （彝族民歌）道路再长，再长，遇到大河就断了；山脉再长，再长，遇到大海就断了；伟大的毛泽东思想啊，高山隔不断，大海不能挡。句句话儿光闪闪，传遍五湖四海、万水千山，把各族人民的心照亮！
