	Asian and African public opinion has warmly praised Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement. China unreservedly supports the Vietnamese people. The U.S. imperialists have miscalculated and will inevitably dig their own graves.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Phnom Penh on the 25th, the Cambodian "Telegraph" published an editorial on the 25th stating that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's important statement and the massive rally of nearly a million people in Beijing show that the People's Republic of China has a clear stance and a correct attitude towards the U.S. aggression against Vietnam.

	The editorial mentioned that in his statement, Chairman Liu Shaoqi warned the U.S. aggressors, "Do not miscalculate, do not misjudge your opponent." The editorial said: "U.S. imperialism, based on its erroneous analysis of the situation, has mistakenly estimated, judged, and evaluated its opponent." "U.S. imperialism will be greatly disappointed."

	The editorial pointed out that when Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Vice Premier Tao Zhu condemned the U.S. aggressors for having torn up the Geneva Agreement, it stated: "China's adoption of this firm stance is logical and beyond reproach. The entire international community knows that since the other party has deliberately violated and trampled on the agreement, what is there left to adhere to? This agreement has become worthless."

	The editorial said, "The People's Republic of China has always fulfilled its obligations. It has always been conscientious and firm in doing so."

	The editorial also said, "The People's Republic of China has taken all measures to counter U.S. aggression in this region," "because the People's Republic of China keeps its word. Its attitude is steadfast and responsible."

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Rawalpindi on the 25th, the Pakistani "Fight" newspaper published an editorial on the 25th stating that in his statement, Chairman Liu Shaoqi reiterated that U.S. aggression against Vietnam is aggression against China. This is a response to U.S. provocations.

	The editorial pointed out: "U.S. aggression against Vietnam seriously threatens world peace."

	The editorial said, the U.S. ruling class is very afraid of China's growing strength and rising prestige, and it attempts to "contain" China's rapidly growing power.

	The editorial said, all peace-loving countries in the world believe that the U.S. is the aggressor in the Vietnam War.

	The "Construction" newspaper published an article on the same day stating that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement will have a profound impact.

	The article pointed out that China is absolutely not afraid of U.S. threats, and the Chinese government is fully prepared. The inevitable outcome of the Vietnam War is the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam and the complete failure of U.S. aggression.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Dar es Salaam on the 23rd, David Sibeko, the chief representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa), said on the 23rd that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement on the 22nd supporting Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to All Compatriots" is a "genuine Marxist-Leninist revolutionary statement under the correct and wise guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong."

	He said, "We remind the progressive people of the world that the People's Republic of China, through Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement, takes the lead in fulfilling the international obligations of all genuine revolutionary forces, unreservedly and resolutely supporting the heroic Vietnamese people."

	Sibeko said that at the massive rally of a million people in Beijing supporting the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle, Chairman Liu Shaoqi's statement was read, clearly proclaiming that China's vast territory is a reliable rear base for the Vietnamese people. Sibeko emphasized, "This is the best expression of the Chinese people and the Vietnamese people uniting as one in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and jointly striking at U.S. imperialism."

	He added, the stance taken by the People's Republic of China in supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle should be supported by all progressive forces.

    中国无保留地支持越南人民
    美帝打错算盘必然自掘坟墓
    据新华社金边二十五日电　《柬埔寨电讯报》二十五日发表社论说，刘少奇主席的重要声明和北京市近百万人民的盛大集会，说明了人民中国对美国侵略越南的战争所持的明确的立场和采取的正确的态度。
    社论谈到刘少奇主席在声明中正告美国侵略者“不要打错了算盘，看错了对象。”这个警告时说：“美帝国主义从对形势的错误分析出发，错误地估计、判断和评价了他的对手”；“美帝国主义必将大失所望”。
    社论在谈到刘少奇主席和陶铸副总理谴责美国侵略者已经把日内瓦协议撕得粉碎的话时指出：中国“采取这种坚定的立场是合乎逻辑的，是无可非议的。整个国际舆论都知道，既然另一方有计划地破坏和践踏了协议，还有什么可遵守的呢？这个协议已经毫无价值了。”
    社论说：“中华人民共和国一贯履行自己所承担的义务。她始终是问心无愧和坚定地这样做的。”
    社论还说，“人民中国已经采取了一切措施，以对付美国在世界这一地区的侵略”，“因为中华人民共和国说话是算数的。她的态度是坚持不渝的和负责任的。”
    新华社拉瓦尔品第二十五日电　巴基斯坦《战斗报》二十五日发表社论说，刘少奇主席在声明中重申，美国对越南的侵略，就是对中国的侵略，这是对美国的挑衅作出的答复。
    社论指出：“美国对越南的侵略，严重地威胁着世界和平。”
    社论说，美国统治集团非常害怕中国日益强大的力量和日益上升的威望，它企图“遏制”中国迅速增长的力量。
    社论说，世界上一切爱好和平的国家都认为：美国是越南战争中的侵略者。
    《建设报》在同一天发表一篇文章说，刘少奇主席的声明将产生深远的影响。
    文章指出，中国绝对不怕美国的威胁，中国政府有了充分的准备。越南战争的必然的结局是，美国军队撤出越南和美国的侵略遭到彻底的失败。
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆二十三日电　阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会首席代表戴维·西贝科二十三日在这里对新华社记者说，刘少奇主席二十二日发表的支持胡志明主席《告全国同胞书》的声明，是“在毛泽东主席正确而英明的思想指导下的真正的马克思列宁主义的革命的表态”。
    他说：“我们提醒全世界进步人民注意，中华人民共和国通过刘少奇主席的声明，带头履行一切真正革命力量的国际义务，无保留地坚决支持英雄的越南人民。”
    西贝科说，在北京举行的支持越南人民英勇斗争的百万人盛大集会上，宣读了刘少奇主席的声明，这个声明清楚地宣告，中国辽阔的国土，是越南人民的可靠后方。西贝科强调指出：“这是中国人民和越南人民在反对美帝国主义和共同打击美帝国主义的斗争中同心同德的最好表示。”
    他接着说，中华人民共和国采取的支持越南人民斗争的立场应该受到一切进步力量的支持。
