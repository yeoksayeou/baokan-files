The "study-use meetings" for Chairman Mao's works in various production brigades of Shangzhuang Commune, Xushui County, Hebei Province, have been promoted from a few pilot points to the entire commune. After the movement to study Chairman Mao's works gained momentum, the masses eagerly demanded to exchange experiences and insights. At this time, we took Gaozhuang Brigade as a pilot and held a "study-use meeting" for Chairman Mao's works, which was warmly welcomed by the masses. We organized the secretaries of the party branches in various brigades to visit the site, and the "study-use meetings" quickly spread throughout the commune.

The methods for holding "study-use meetings" are determined based on the demands and needs of the commune members and the problems that need to be solved. Large-scale comprehensive "study-use meetings" can be held for the entire brigade, or "study-use meetings" can be held for production teams; "study-use meetings" can also be held for specific groups (such as youth, women, and militia).

From the current situation, the advantages of "study-use meetings" are numerous. Firstly, they emphasize the "use" aspect. During the "study-use meetings," speakers share their study insights, discuss their changes in thinking, and talk about the process of learning and applying. Secondly, they are exchange meetings for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, which can inspire and guide each other, promoting mutual progress. Those who study and apply well are encouraged, while those who study and apply less are also improved. Each "study-use meeting" has a significant promoting effect on the ideological transformation of the farmers. Thirdly, it is a good place to cultivate and train cadres, enabling the cadre force to grow and strengthen rapidly. Fourthly, and most importantly, the "study-use meetings" are battlefields for promoting the proletarian and eliminating the bourgeoisie. Through the "study-use meetings," Mao Zedong Thought can occupy the ideological front, promote righteousness, suppress evil, and create a strong political atmosphere among the masses.

What is the purpose of the "study-use meetings," and where do they ultimately lead? This is a crucial issue for improving the quality of "study-use meetings" and making them better. Our experience is that we must take the transformation of the farmers' worldview, the promotion of the proletarian and the elimination of the bourgeoisie, and the advancement of the farmers' ideological transformation as the starting point and the ultimate goal of the "study-use meetings." Therefore, the line of class struggle and the struggle to promote the proletarian and eliminate the bourgeoisie should run through the entire process of the "study-use meetings."

To achieve this, the main methods are:

1. Regardless of the type of "study-use meeting," it is important to closely combine it with the current struggle tasks. What to do, what to study, and what to apply should be determined by the "study-use meeting." This approach has the advantage of easily mobilizing the enthusiasm of cadres and commune members to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, achieving immediate results, and making the "study-use meetings" rich and varied. However, holding "study-use meetings" for Chairman Mao's works should not be merely seen as a means to complete a certain task but should be regarded as the highest directive for all work, promoting ideological transformation and fundamentally raising the class consciousness of the masses. For example, during the election of cadres, some commune members had debates on whether to elect revolutionaries or compromisers, which was actually a reflection of class struggle in the election issue. During the discussion of candidates for brigade leader in Xiaoxinzhuang Brigade, the majority advocated for selecting Lu Luo, saying he was from a poor peasant background, an old party member, and always insisted on the socialist direction, was selfless, and had the ability to get things done, although he had some shortcomings in his work style. Those with serious capitalist thoughts opposed him, saying Lu Luo was too strict, had a harsh attitude, and was too harsh in criticizing people, and could not be the brigade leader, advocating for a compromiser. The party branch seized this opportunity to organize commune members to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's statements on the issue of political power and the five conditions for revolutionary successors, allowing commune members to widely discuss: why to elect revolutionaries and not compromisers; who elects revolutionaries and who elects compromisers, and why? Through extensive discussions, commune members realized that different classes have different standpoints, which is a reflection of class struggle in the election issue. Based on this heightened awareness, the brigade held a "study-use meeting," where activists spoke frankly: electing or not electing revolutionaries is a major issue of whether to insist on the socialist direction. Some people advocated for compromisers, which was an attempt to promote individual freedom, undermine the collective, and take the capitalist road. This raised the election issue to the level of class struggle, achieving a revolution in thought. Many commune members said, "It seems that compromising in the election of cadres is not acceptable!"

2. Focus on the active thoughts in class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and hold "study-use meetings" with clear targets. The method is: through mobilizing the masses to discuss the current struggle tasks, through dissecting typical cases, and through discussions with instructors and activists, to grasp active thoughts. Once active thoughts are grasped, organize instructors to lead the masses to study relevant parts of Chairman Mao's quotations with clear targets and purposes, widely discuss, distinguish right from wrong, discover, and cultivate speakers for the "study-use meetings." For example, class enemies use family relationships to blur class lines, and some commune members with low class consciousness do not understand whether class affinity or family affinity is closer. Gaozhuang Brigade seized this issue, using the vivid example of poor and lower-middle peasants donating blood for Yan Dezai, to give commune members a class education. Poor peasant Yan Dezai had a stomach perforation and needed an operation urgently requiring blood donation. Poor and lower-middle peasant commune members rushed to the hospital upon hearing the news, competing to donate blood. Many poor and lower-middle peasants also donated eggs to those who donated blood, finally saving Yan Dezai. The Gaozhuang Club made this vivid deed into a slide and showed it at the "study-use meeting." Yan Dezai excitedly said at the meeting: "Father and mother are not as close as classmates. If it weren't for my class brothers saving me, I would have been buried long ago. In the future, I will definitely follow the party's instructions, wholeheartedly for the collective, and work hard for a lifetime!" For example, in the later stage of the socialist education movement, some people thought that class struggle had ended, and if it existed, it would be a few years later, leading to complacency. Xiaosizhuang Brigade seized this active thought and, through the "study-use meeting," educated the farmers on the sharpness and complexity of class struggle. Commune members at the "study-use meeting" passionately spoke about how they uncovered the class enemies' tricks, exposing the class enemies' sabotage behaviors, and raising the masses' awareness of class struggle. They said, "Originally, after the socialist education movement, the class enemies did not give up, and we must never forget class struggle."

3. Through the contrast of two types of thoughts, eliminate bourgeois thoughts and establish proletarian thoughts. For example, Shangzhuang Brigade, in a "study-use meeting," focused on how to correctly handle the relationship between local and overall interests, presenting two different cases: the ninth team, adjacent to the brigade's small farmland with two mu of land, originally planted with sorghum. The brigade's farmland cultivated high-quality sorghum seeds, fearing cross-pollination. The ninth team's commune members said, "Cultivating high-quality varieties is related to the affairs of all thirteen teams in the brigade, and we should preserve the brigade's high-quality varieties, which is putting small benefits under big benefits." They did not wait for the brigade to assign work and completely changed to planting potatoes. In contrast, a commune member in the twelfth team seized the wood that the brigade needed and bought it to the local small wood mill. The brigade party branch used these two positive and negative examples as living teaching materials, first organizing the instructors and learning cadres of each team to discuss and analyze based on Chairman Mao's relevant quotations. Then the cadres returned to their teams and guided the masses in the same way, holding small "study-use meetings." Based on this, the brigade held a "study-use meeting." The meeting had two quotation boards, selecting three sentences: "We should advocate considering the overall situation." "We must oppose the tendency of localism that only cares about oneself and not others." "Completely selfless and dedicated to others." What to eliminate and what to establish was clear, leaving a deep impression on people.

4. To make the "study-use meetings" truly have combativeness and thoughtfulness, it is necessary to open up thoughts, talk about struggles, talk about the process of ideological changes, put thoughts forward, and clarify viewpoints. The more there are vivid facts and ideological struggle processes, the more it can show the great role of Mao Zedong Thought in ideological struggles, the deeper the education; otherwise, it is less effective. Once, at a "study-use meeting," many people talked about how they donated blood to save the life of poor peasant Yan Dezai. Cai Fenglin's speech was particularly moving. He not only talked about the process of donating blood but also vividly talked about his process of using Mao Zedong Thought to struggle with the "I" character. He said, "Although I volunteered to donate blood, when it was time to donate, my thoughts struggled, and fear overwhelmed my revolutionary courage. At this critical moment, I thought of Chairman Mao's words: 'Completely selfless and dedicated to others.' I also thought of Dr. Norman Bethune, a foreigner, who came to China to help the Chinese people's liberation, and for the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, sacrificed his own life. How could I put the 'I' character first when saving my class brother? Isn't this against Chairman Mao's teachings? So, I resolutely donated blood." His speech left a deep impression on people. People saw the great glory of Mao Zedong Thought and the great role of Mao Zedong Thought in promoting ideological transformation from this event.

To hold good "study-use meetings," it is necessary to seriously implement the mass line and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. In fact, whether the "study-use meetings" are good or not does not depend on the "study-use meetings" themselves, but on the daily study and application of Chairman Mao's works by the masses. Only by studying and applying well in daily life can the "study-use meetings" have lively content. The "study-use meetings" are actually a review of the achievements of daily study and application of Chairman Mao's works, a summary and exchange of study and application experiences. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize daily study and application.

To promote the daily study and application and push the study movement to develop continuously, we have also realized that it is necessary to establish guiding organizations. Each brigade in our commune establishes a core guiding group, based on the current tasks, analyzes the ideological trends of commune members, determines the content of the "study-use meetings," and helps instructors prepare lessons. When preparing lessons, it is necessary to let everyone understand why to study and apply this content, what is the key point to study and apply, what problems to solve, and what goals to achieve. Instructors, before the "study-use meetings," deliver books to the door and conduct in-depth guidance in small groups. The process of holding "study-use meetings" is actually the process of guiding, discussing, and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Practice has proven that the "study-use meetings" are a good form for the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Our initial understanding is not yet mature. How to further improve the quality of the "study-use meetings" and how to persist in them are issues that still need to be continuously accumulated with experience. In the future, we will continuously explore experiences in the process of doing, learning, and summarizing, making the "study-use meetings" continuously develop, progress, and improve.

    “学用会”——农民活学活用毛主席著作的好形式
    中共徐水县商庄公社委员会
    河北省徐水县商庄公社各个大队的毛主席著作“学用会”，是由点到面逐步推广起来的。当大学毛主席著作的运动兴起之后，群众纷纷要求交流心得、交流经验。这时我们以高庄大队为试点举办了毛主席著作“学用会”，受到群众热烈欢迎。我们组织各大队党支部书记去现场参观，“学用会”很快在全公社推广开来。
    “学用会”的开法，是根据社员的要求和需要解决的问题来决定的。可以开全大队的大型综合“学用会”，可以开生产队“学用会”；也可以按系统（如青年、妇女、民兵）开“学用会”。
    从这一段的情况来看，“学用会”的好处很多。首先，它突出了“用”字。在“学用会”上，发言的人大谈学习心得，谈思想变化，谈学和用的过程。第二，它是学用毛泽东思想的经验交流会，能互相启发、互相辅导、互相推动。学用好的受到鼓舞，学用差些的也得到提高。每次“学用会”，对农民的思想革命化，都有明显的促进作用。第三，是培养锻炼骨干分子的好场所，通过“学用会”能使骨干力量迅速成长壮大起来。第四，更重要的是：“学用会”是兴无灭资的战场，通过“学用会”能使毛泽东思想占领思想阵地，树正气，压邪气，在群众中造成浓厚的政治空气。
    “学用会”的目的是什么，落脚到那里？这是提高“学用会”质量，使“学用会”越开越好的重要问题。我们的经验是：必须以改造农民的世界观，兴无灭资，促进农民的思想革命化，作为“学用会”的出发点和落脚点。因此，阶级斗争这条纲，兴无灭资的斗争，应该贯穿于“学用会”的始终。
    为了达到这一点，主要的作法是：
    一、不论是那种“学用会”，都要注意紧紧结合当前的斗争任务，做什么，学什么，用什么，“学用会”就集中交流什么。这样做的好处是：容易调动干部和社员学用毛主席著作的积极性，容易收到立竿见影之效，“学用会”也容易开得丰富多彩。但是，举办毛主席著作“学用会”，不能仅仅当作完成某项任务的手段，而应该是把毛主席的书当作各项工作的最高指示，来促进人的思想革命化，从根本上提高群众的阶级觉悟。譬如，不少地方在选举干部时，社员中对待选举问题存在着选革命派、还是选和事佬的斗争，这实际上是阶级斗争在选举问题上的反映。小辛庄大队在酝酿大队长候选人的时候，大多数人主张选卢洛同，说他是贫农出身，老党员，始终坚持社会主义方向，大公无私，有办事能力，虽然在工作作风上有一些缺点，但他是坚持社会主义革命的。资本主义思想严重的人就反对，说卢洛同“卡”的死，态度生硬，“挖苦人太狠”，不能当大队长，主张选一位和事佬。党支部抓住这件事，组织社员反复学习毛主席有关政权问题的论述和革命接班人五项条件，让社员们广泛议论：为什么要选举革命派，不选举和事佬；什么人选革命派，什么人选和事佬，为什么？经过广泛讨论，社员们认识到不同阶级有不同的立场，这是阶级斗争在选举问题上的反映。这样，在提高认识的基础上，大队召开了“学用会”，积极分子们一针见血地说：选不选革命派，是坚持不坚持社会主义方向的大问题。有的人主张选和事佬，就是企图搞小自由，挖集体墙脚，是想走资本主义道路。这就把选举的问题提到了阶级斗争的高度，从思想上来了个革命。不少社员说：“看来在选举干部上和稀泥可不行呀！”
    二、抓住阶级斗争和两条道路斗争中的活思想，有针对性地召开“学用会”。办法是：通过发动群众讨论当前斗争任务，通过解剖典型事例，通过和辅导员积极分子座谈，抓活思想。活思想一经抓住，就组织辅导员有目的、有针对性地领导群众学习毛主席语录的有关部分，广泛展开讨论，明辨是非，发现和培养“学用会”上的发言人。譬如，阶级敌人利用家族关系来模糊阶级界线，有的社员阶级觉悟不高，弄不清阶级亲还是家族亲。高庄大队就针对这个问题，抓住了贫农下中农为阎德子输血的生动事例，向社员进行了一课阶级教育。贫农社员阎德子得了胃穿孔，动手术急需输血。高庄贫农下中农社员闻讯赶到医院，争先输血，许多贫农下中农又为输血的人献鸡蛋，终于把阎德子救活了。高庄俱乐部把这一件生动事迹画成幻灯片，在“学用会”上放映。阎德子在会上激动地说：“爹亲娘亲没有阶级亲。要不是阶级兄弟救我，我早就入土了。今后我坚决听党的话，一心为集体，好好干一辈子！”又如社会主义教育运动后期，有些人认为阶级斗争没有了，就是有的话，也是几年以后的事了，思想上产生了麻痹情绪。小寺各庄大队，就抓住这个活思想，通过“学用会”向农民进行阶级斗争的尖锐性、复杂性的教育。社员们在“学用会”上激昂地讲出了自己怎样识破阶级敌人的过程，揭发了阶级敌人的破坏行为，使广大群众对阶级斗争的认识提高了一步。他们说：“原来经过社会主义教育运动，阶级敌人并没有死心，我们永远不要忘记阶级斗争。”
    三、通过两种思想典型的对比，破资产阶级思想，立无产阶级思想。例如，商庄大队在一次“学用会”上，抓住如何正确对待局部和全局的关系，摆出了两种不同的事例：九队在挨着大队小农场的二亩地里，原来种了高粱。大队农场培育的高粱优良种子，怕串花。九队社员们说：“培育优良品种是关系着全大队十三个小队的事，应该保全农场的优良品种，这是小利服从大利。”他们没等大队给出工，就全部改种了山药。与此相反，十二队的一个社员，把大队要用的木材，抢购到本队小木厂里。大队党支部以这样正、反两个例子为活教材，先组织各队的辅导员和学习骨干，对照毛主席有关语录，大家讲，大家议，进行分析。接着骨干回到队里，用同样办法辅导群众，开小型“学用会”。在这个基础上大队召开了“学用会”。会上挂了两块语录牌，选了三句话：“要提倡顾全大局。”“必须反对只顾自己不顾别人的本位主义的倾向。”“毫不利己专门利人。”破什么，立什么，旗帜鲜明，给人留下深刻的印象。
    四、要使“学用会”真正具有战斗性和思想性，必须敞思想，谈斗争，谈思想变化的过程，把思想摆进去，把观点亮出来。凡是有生动事实又有思想斗争过程的，能够看出毛泽东思想在思想斗争中起着怎么样的巨大作用的，教育人就深；反之，就差。有一次“学用会”上，许多人都谈如何为贫农社员阎德子输血，抢救阎德子生命的生动事迹。蔡凤林谈的特别感人，他不光谈了输血的过程，更生动地谈了他如何用毛泽东思想和“我”字斗的思想变化过程。他说：“我虽然是自报奋勇去输血的，但真要输血了，思想却起了斗争，畏惧心情压住了革命勇气。就在这一关键时刻，我想起了毛主席的话：‘毫不利己专门利人’。又想到白求恩大夫是个外国人，为了帮助中国人民解放，不远万里来到中国，还为了中国人民的革命事业，牺牲了自己的生命，我怎么能在抢救阶级弟兄的时候‘我’字当头？这不是违反毛主席的教导吗？于是我毅然决然地去输了血。”他的发言给了人们深刻的印象。人们从这件事情里看到了毛泽东思想的伟大光辉，看到了毛泽东思想对于促进人的思想革命化的伟大作用。
    开好“学用会”必须认真贯彻群众路线，充分发动群众的积极性。实际上“学用会”开得好不好，并不在“学用会”本身，关键在于平日群众学用毛主席著作的好坏。只有平日学用好，“学用会”才有生动活泼的内容。“学用会”实际上是平日学用毛主席著作成绩的检阅，是学用经验的总结、交流。所以，必须强调平日的学用。
    要搞好平日的学用，推动学习运动不断发展，我们还体会到，必须建立辅导组织。我们公社每个大队建立核心辅导小组，根据当前任务，分析社员思想动向，确定“学用会”的内容，帮助辅导员进行备课。备课时，要让大家弄清为什么学用这个内容，重点学用那一点，解决什么问题，达到什么目的。辅导员在“学用会”前，送书上门和深入小组进行辅导。举办“学用会”的过程，实际上是辅导、讨论、学用毛主席著作的过程。
    实践证明：“学用会”是群众活学活用毛主席著作的一种好形式。我们这些初步体会，还不成熟。如何进一步提高“学用会”的质量，如何做到持之以恒，都还需要继续积累经验。今后，要在边做、边学、边总结中，逐步摸索经验，使“学用会”不断有所发展，有所前进，有所提高。
