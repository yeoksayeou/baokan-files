	Malaysia's representative Sharma spoke at the emergency meeting of the Asian-African Writers' Conference today, saying: "The oppressed nations and peoples of the world hail Mao Zedong Thought as their spiritual atomic bomb." "With it, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America can shatter imperialism led by the United States and the old and new colonialism, as well as modern revisionism led by the Soviet leadership."

	In his lengthy speech, Sharma passionately praised the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. He said: "Mao Zedong Thought embodies the living revolutionary principles of the contemporary world. It is the pinnacle of living Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese people, through concrete actions, have raised the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and shocked the world."

	He said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for the working class and the people of the world, providing them with the theory of people's war and teaching them the great truth that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. Under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, the Malaysian people are strengthening their struggle against the enemy—British and American imperialists and their local puppets, especially in armed struggle."

	Sharma said: "Mao Zedong Thought also teaches oppressed nations and peoples to destroy the old exploitative economy and build a new socialist economy, which requires adopting the great principle of self-reliance rather than relying on external aid."

	He said: "Chairman Mao's profound exposition that the entire transition period from socialism to communism is marked by class struggle and class conflict, which may last for decades or even centuries, is a creative contribution to the world proletarian revolution. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought and their own great revolutionary tradition, the Chinese people have grasped this theory, entered the battle, and opened up a new front in the people's war, which is the cultural front. This is a major event in the lives of all revolutionaries."

	He said, "In the course of this revolution, the Chinese people are radiating new light, which not only advances the socialist cause of the Chinese people but also has an immeasurable impact on the present and future of the world. Imperialists, reactionaries, and modern revisionists are trembling with fear, but the working class and the people of the world are cheering."

	Sharma also emphasized the great influence of the Chinese revolution. He said: "The capital of the People's Republic of China is the revolutionary center and guiding light for all the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as other oppressed peoples, who oppose imperialism led by the United States and all reactionaries, and who oppose modern revisionism led by the Soviet leadership under various banners." He said: "Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the leader of the Chinese revolution and the great revolutionary leader of all peoples, the Chinese people have made and continue to make great contributions to the revolutionary struggles of oppressed nations and peoples."

	Sharma expressed his firm support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. He said that every new victory of the Vietnamese people "provides all revolutionary peoples with new and rich lessons on the powerful might of people's war and how to wage people's war to strike at the most ferocious enemy in the world."

	Sharma said that the Malaysian people, led by the Malaysian working class, with the Malaysian Communist Party as its core, the Malaysian National Liberation Army as its revolutionary army, and the Malaysian National Liberation League as its united front organization, have been waging an unyielding struggle for liberation. The Malaysian people's struggle takes armed struggle as its main form.

	He strongly condemned the collusion between the imperialists led by the United States and the Soviet modern revisionists in Malaysia (including Singapore), North Borneo, Indonesia, and other Southeast Asian countries, conspiring to suppress national liberation movements and attempting to extinguish the flames of revolution in these regions.

	He said, "We Asian-African writers not only have to fight against imperialism led by the United States and all reactionaries, but we must also thoroughly oppose and expose the betrayal of the interests of the world's peoples by modern revisionism centered in Moscow. The imperialists and all reactionaries, with the Soviet leadership at their helm, are more deceptive, more vicious, and more dangerous accomplices, monsters, and demons. They put on a fake anti-imperialist facade but especially energetically give real support to imperialism."

	Sharma cited facts to expose the true face of Soviet revisionist traitors: Soviet revisionists dare not declare the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the sole organization and representative of the armed forces and people of South Vietnam. They peddle the "peace talks" scam of American imperialism everywhere, attempting to sell out the Vietnamese people and bring the Vietnam issue onto the track of Sino-Soviet cooperation. They capitulate to American imperialism's nuclear blackmail, allowing the United States to become the nuclear hegemon. They concocted the so-called "Tashkent spirit." They assured American imperialism of the end of the "Berlin crisis," allowing American imperialism to transfer troops to Vietnam, betraying the interests of the German people, and serving American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. They have betrayed the Palestinian Arab people, the Cuban people, the Indonesian people, the Japanese people, and all revolutionary peoples of the world.

	Sharma also strongly exposed and condemned the crimes of Soviet revisionism in colluding with American and British imperialism to sabotage the Malaysian people's liberation movement. They praised Britain's conquest of Singapore as being "rescued from the hands of robbers by a more civilized and wealthy gentleman," turning this "desolate island" into a new colonial product of British neocolonialism, "Malaysia." Soviet revisionists even earlier sided with British neocolonialism, exposing their hostility towards the Malaysian people's revolutionary goals and national liberation movement.

	He said, "There is no doubt that we must simultaneously oppose modern revisionists centered in Moscow if we are to effectively oppose imperialism led by the United States and all reactionaries."

    马来亚代表沙尔玛的发言
    新华社一日讯　马来亚代表沙尔玛今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上发言时说：“全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民欢呼毛泽东思想是他们的精神原子弹”。“亚非拉人民有了它，就可以粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义以及苏联领导集团为首的现代修正主义。”
    沙尔玛在他的长篇发言中，满怀激情地热烈地赞颂了毛泽东思想的伟大力量。他说：毛泽东思想“体现了当代世界的活的革命原则。它是活的马克思列宁主义的顶峰。中国人民以具体行动高举毛泽东思想而震惊了世界”。
    他说：“毛泽东思想是全世界工人阶级和人民的灯塔，给了他们以人民战争的理论，教给他们枪杆子里面出政权的伟大真理。马来亚人民在毛泽东思想鼓舞下，正在各方面特别在武装斗争方面，加强反对敌人——英美帝国主义者及其在当地傀儡的斗争。”
    沙尔玛说：“毛泽东思想同时也教导被压迫民族和被压迫人民，要破坏旧的剥削经济，建立新的社会主义经济，这就需要采取自力更生这一伟大原则，而不能依赖外援。”
    他说：“毛泽东主席关于从社会主义到共产主义的整个过渡时期都存在着阶级和阶级斗争，这一过渡可能需要数十年以上乃至数百年的英明的阐述，是对世界无产阶级革命的创造性的贡献。以毛泽东思想和以自己的伟大的革命传统武装起来的中国人民，掌握了这一理论，投入了战斗，在人民战争中开辟了一条新的战线，这就是文化战线上的革命。这是所有革命者生活中的一件大事。”
    他说，“在进行这场革命的过程中，中国人民正放射出新的光芒，它不仅推进着中国人民的社会主义事业，而且对世界的现在和未来发挥着不可估量的影响。帝国主义、反动派和现代修正主义正在吓得发抖，但是工人阶级和全世界人民都为之欢呼”。
    沙尔玛还强调地谈到了中国革命的伟大影响。他说：“中华人民共和国的首都是所有反对以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派，所有反对以苏联领导集团为首的各种招牌的现代修正主义的亚非拉以及其他被压迫人民的革命中心和指路明灯。”他说：“中国人民在他们的革命领袖、也是所有各国人民的伟大革命领袖毛泽东思想的指引下，已经并且继续对被压迫民族和被压迫人民的革命斗争作出了伟大的贡献。”
    沙尔玛表示坚决支持越南人民的正义斗争。他说，越南人民的每一个新胜利，“都向所有革命人民提供了关于人民战争的强大威力和怎样开展人民战争来打击世界最凶恶敌人的新的丰富的教益。”
    沙尔玛说，马来亚人民，以马来亚工人阶级为领导、以马来亚共产党为核心、以马来亚民族解放军作为其革命的军队和以马来亚民族解放同盟作为其统一战线组织，进行了不屈不挠的解放斗争。马来亚人民的斗争以武装斗争为主要形式。
    他强烈谴责以美国为首的帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者互相勾结，在马来亚（包括新加坡）、北加里曼丹、印度尼西亚和其他东南亚国家，合谋镇压民族解放运动，企图扑灭这些地区的革命斗争的火焰。
    他说，我们亚非作家不仅要向以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派作斗争，而且要彻底反对和揭露以莫斯科为中心的现代修正主义对世界人民利益的背叛。以苏联领导集团为首的帝国主义和一切反动派的帮凶、怪物和牛鬼蛇神，是更有欺骗性、更恶毒、更危险的。他们作出假反帝的姿态，而特别卖力地给帝国主义以真的支持。
    沙尔玛列举事实揭露苏联修正主义叛徒的面貌：苏联修正主义者不敢宣布越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方解放武装力量和人民的唯一组织和代表；他们到处贩卖美帝国主义的“和平谈判”骗局，企图出卖越南人民，把越南问题纳入美苏合作轨道；他们在美帝国主义核讹诈面前投降，允许美国成为核霸王；他们炮制所谓“塔什干精神”；他们向美帝国主义保证结束“柏林危机”，使美帝国主义把军队调至越南，背叛德国人民的利益，而为美帝国主义侵越效劳；他们背叛了巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民、古巴人民、印度尼西亚人民、日本人民以及世界一切革命的人民。
    沙尔玛还强烈地揭露和谴责苏联修正主义勾结美英帝国主义，破坏马来亚人民解放运动的罪行。他们把英国对新加坡的征服，吹捧成“由一个更文明的有钱的绅士”，把“这个荒岛”“从强盗手中拯救出来。”苏联修正主义者甚至在更早的时候就袒护英国新殖民主义的产物“马来西亚”，暴露他们对马来亚人民革命目标和民族解放运动的敌视。
    他说，不容置疑，我们不同时反对以莫斯科为中心的现代修正主义者，就不能有效地反对以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派。
