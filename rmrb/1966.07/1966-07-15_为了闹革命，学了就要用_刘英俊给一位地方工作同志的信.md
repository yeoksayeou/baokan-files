Dear Comrade XX,

...

How can we truly master Chairman Mao's thoughts? First, we must have a clear purpose. Our study is not for mere formality, nor is it to memorize chapters and phrases to show off. Instead, it is to make revolution, to build the country, to transform our thoughts and to transform nature. In short, it is to put what we learn into practice. Therefore, we must learn what we need to use, and learning and doing must go hand in hand. This means we should "study with problems in mind, apply what we learn actively, and integrate study with practice." If what we learn does not match what we do, or what we say does not match what we do, then learning is useless. If there are many problems and we can't learn everything at once, what should we do? We should follow the spirit of "learning what is urgently needed first." Whatever is urgently needed, we should learn that first. This way, we can apply what we learn and see immediate results.

In our studies, we must not be greedy for quantity or speed, rushing through the material. We should focus on quality, learning deeply. We should study every day and apply what we learn every day, persistently. Only in this way can we accumulate knowledge gradually, improve step by step, and make continuous progress. As long as we study with the aim of solving practical problems in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments, we will find studying more and more interesting, and we will love studying more and more. This way, we can gradually master Chairman Mao's thoughts.

We, the younger generation, must inherit the glorious tradition of the revolutionary forerunners. We must have the resolve and confidence to remove all the "mountains" big and small on our path forward. We should, as Chairman Mao hopes, be full of confidence and determination for the great cause of communism.

...

Yours sincerely,
Liu Yingjun

　　为了闹革命，学了就要用
　　——刘英俊给一位地方工作同志的信××同志：
　　……。
    怎样才能把毛主席思想学到手呢？首先要明确一个目的，我们学习不是为了走形式，更不是为了记一些章节词句，显示自己，而是为了闹革命、搞建设，是为了改造思想和改造大自然。总的来讲，就是为了用。因此，就要用啥学啥，学和做绝不能分家，也就是要“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合”。如果学的和做的、说的和做的不统一，那样学了也等于没学。如果问题很多，一时学不了咋办呢？就要本着“急用先学”的精神，急用什么就先学什么，这样学了就能用上，得到“立竿见影”的好效果。……在学习中，不能贪多图快，走马观花，要少而精，学而懂。要天天学，天天用，持之以恒。这样才能日积月累，逐步提高，不断进步。只要我们本着为了解决阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验当中的实际问题去学习，就会越学越有味道，越学越爱学，就能一步一步地把毛主席的思想学到手。
    我们青年一代必须要继承革命前辈的光荣传统，一定要有决心和信心把自己在前进道路上的大小“山”搬掉。要象毛主席所希望的那样，对共产主义伟大的事业充满胜利的信心和决心。
        ……。
              此致敬礼
