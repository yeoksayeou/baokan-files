The U.S. imperialists' savage bombing of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the second-largest city, Haiphong, is yet another of their heinous crimes. The heroic Vietnamese people, the revolutionary people of all countries, and all justice-loving people in the world will never forgive this crime of the U.S. imperialists.

The U.S. aggressors' air raids on Hanoi and Haiphong merely show that they are in a state of desperation and are making a futile struggle in the face of the unyielding struggle of the strong Vietnamese people. This does not show the strength of the U.S. aggressors, but rather their weakness and helplessness.

This bombing is a serious step in the U.S. imperialists' "gradual escalation" of the war of aggression against Vietnam. The U.S. imperialists have been bombing North Vietnam for more than a year, but they have not been able to reverse their defeat on the battlefields of South Vietnam. The more they escalate their bombing of North Vietnam, the more desperate their situation in South Vietnam becomes. Every time the U.S. aggressors escalate the war in Vietnam, they move one step closer to the grave.

A few days ago, the war criminal Johnson openly boasted that the United States "must continue to raise the cost of aggression at its source" to achieve a "decent peace." This means that the U.S. imperialists are trying to use bombs to create a situation for "negotiations," forcing the Vietnamese people to surrender. However, the heroic Vietnamese people are not intimidated. No matter how vicious and despicable the methods the U.S. imperialists use, they cannot shake the firm resolve of the 31 million Vietnamese people to liberate the South, defend the North, and unify the country. On June 30, the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a solemn statement: The U.S. aggressors' every "escalation" of the war in Vietnam will be crushed, and every criminal act will be punished accordingly.

After the U.S. imperialists bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, the Associated Press openly revealed: "This new development in the situation appeared after some cautious consultations between the United States and the Soviet bloc countries." Recently, the Soviet leadership has been hinting everywhere that the United States has "sincerity" in peacefully resolving the Vietnam issue and actively promoting "negotiations." This makes it clear that the U.S. imperialists' plot of "bombing for talks" is closely coordinated with the Soviet leadership. The true face of the Soviet leadership as a henchman of U.S. imperialism has once again been exposed to the people of the world.

The Chinese people have long been prepared. No matter how high the U.S. imperialists escalate the war, no matter how wide they spread the flames of war, we are determined to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end. The Chinese people will not retreat in the face of the U.S. imperialists' war threats. We are prepared to bear any risks and pay any price to make our contribution, together with the heroic Vietnamese people, to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors.

    在英雄的越南人民斗争面前，美帝国主义的空袭讹诈绝不能得逞
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义穷凶极恶地对越南民主共和国首都河内和第二大城市海防的轰炸，是它犯下的又一个滔天罪行。英雄的越南人民，各国革命人民，以及全世界一切主持正义的人们，都绝不能饶恕美帝国主义的这种罪行。
    美国强盗空袭河内、海防，只是表现它在坚强不屈的越南人民的英勇斗争面前，已经陷于一种无可奈何的、垂死挣扎的境地。这并不能表示美国强盗的什么强大，而只是表示它的软弱无力。
    这一轰炸，是美帝国主义在侵越战争中“逐步升级”的一个严重步骤。美帝国主义对越南北方轰炸一年多，丝毫也没有能够挽救它在南越战场上的败局，它越是扩大对越南北方的轰炸，它在越南南方的处境就越是狼狈。美国侵略者在侵越战争中每升一级，它就更接近坟墓一步。
    约翰逊这个战争罪犯几天以前就公开叫嚷，美国“必须继续在侵略的发源地提高侵略的代价”，以“取得体面的和平”。这就是说，美帝国主义妄想用炸弹来炸出一个“和谈”的局面，迫使越南人民屈膝投降。但是，英雄的越南人民是吓不倒的，美帝国主义不管用什么样凶恶和卑鄙的手段，都不可能动摇三千一百万越南人民解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的坚强意志。越南民主共和国外交部六月三十日严正声明：美国侵略者在越南的每次战争“升级”必将遭到粉碎，它的每个罪恶行动必将遭到应有的惩罚。
    在美帝国主义轰炸河内和海防之后，美联社毫不掩饰地透露：这种“局势的新发展是在美国和苏联集团国家之间进行了一些小心谨慎的洽商以后出现的”。最近，苏共领导到处暗示美国有和平解决越南问题的“诚意”，积极策动“和谈”。这就很清楚，美帝国主义“以炸逼和”的阴谋，是得到苏共领导的密切配合的。苏共领导充当美帝国主义帮凶的真面目，又一次暴露在世界人民面前。
    中国人民是早就做好了准备的。不论美帝国主义把战争升到哪一级，把战火扩大到多大范围，我们都决心把支持越南人民抗美救国的斗争进行到底。中国人民决不会在美帝国主义的战争威胁面前退缩。我们准备承担任何风险，付出一切代价，同英雄的越南人民一起，为彻底打败美国侵略者做出自己的贡献。
