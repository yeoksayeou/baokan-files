The heroic armed forces of South Vietnam have once again annihilated two companies of the U.S. Army. The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has bombarded the headquarters of the U.S. Infantry Division and the two airfields of Thua Thien and Soc Trang. The military and people of Binh Dinh, Quang Nam, and other provinces have annihilated six companies of the puppet army and more than a hundred U.S. soldiers.

	Hanoi, July 28 (New China News Agency) According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, on July 19, the liberation armed forces of Gia Dinh Province ambushed and annihilated two entire companies of invading U.S. troops near Go Vap in three separate engagements.

	On the evening of July 18, the liberation armed forces of Gia Dinh Province attacked the puppet security forces stationed in the Chau Duc area north of Go Vap, killing 30 enemy soldiers. The next day at noon, the U.S. 25th Infantry Division air-dropped a unit to a location about 16 kilometers northwest of Go Vap Town in an attempt to rescue the puppet forces. However, this U.S. unit was immediately surrounded and almost entirely annihilated by the liberation armed forces upon reaching the Sa Dec area.

	Subsequently, the invading U.S. forces air-dropped another unit to the vicinity of Cu Chi near Sa Dec. This U.S. unit was also surrounded and suffered heavy casualties, with more than 60 soldiers killed or wounded.

	Undeterred by their failures, the enemy continued to air-drop U.S. troops to the area northeast of Sa Dec. This unit was also subjected to fierce gunfire from the liberation forces upon landing, resulting in almost total annihilation, with the remaining soldiers fleeing in disarray.

	According to preliminary reports, in these three ambush battles, the liberation armed forces of Gia Dinh Province annihilated two companies of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division, shot down one helicopter, and seized a large quantity of weapons and military supplies.

	According to Western news agencies, this bombardment followed another one on the evening of the 26th. The bombardment lasted for 25 minutes, with many shells landing in the U.S. military base, causing casualties and losses to the U.S. forces.

	It is also reported that on the 28th, the liberation forces captured a village guarded by puppet troops about 29 kilometers from Saigon. On the morning of the 27th, a large U.S. fuel depot near the port of Da Nang caught fire, with flames reaching 60 to 100 feet high.

	According to Western news agencies, the intense artillery fire from the liberation forces caused "windows in the entire city of Saigon to shake from the explosions." The bombardment began in the evening and lasted for two hours.

	That night, the liberation forces also bombarded the Soc Trang Airfield, located about 160 kilometers southwest of Saigon.

	Hanoi, July 27 (New China News Agency) According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the military and people of Binh Dinh, Quang Nam, and Thua Thien provinces in South Vietnam have annihilated six companies of the puppet army and more than a hundred U.S. soldiers in recent battles.
