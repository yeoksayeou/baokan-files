He said, "Every American aggressor killed by the bullets of Vietnamese revolutionaries is an enemy that we have long wanted to eliminate."

	He said, the Jordanian people are resolutely fighting against imperialism, especially American imperialism and old and new colonialism, to achieve their own liberation, to realize the unity of the Arab world, to build a democratic socialist society, and to eliminate the state of the Zionist group.

	He enthusiastically praised the great significance of the victory of the Chinese revolution in world history. He said, "The liberation of 700 million people, they have dedicated all their strength to the cause of liberating the oppressed peoples of the world. In the process of opposing colonialism and its domestic reactionary lackeys, and in the process of building socialism, China has set an example of being wise, steadfast, and willing to sacrifice. I have learned a lot from Mao Zedong Thought. He pointed out that the peoples of Asia and Africa should learn from the great China in terms of revolution and construction, learn from the victorious China, and learn from the heroic and selfless Chinese people. Learn from their experiences in revolution and construction.
