The China Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity and the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament held a meeting on the morning of the 5th to warmly congratulate the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers held in Beijing. They believe that this conference is an unprecedented grand gathering of Asian and African peoples uniting to resist imperialism, expressing the resolute will of the 2 billion Asian and African peoples to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. It will promote the struggle of the Asian and African peoples and all peoples of the world against imperialism and old and new colonialism to develop more vigorously.

The meeting was presided over by Wang Chuanbin, Vice Chairman of the China Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity. Representatives from trade unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, and various sectors including science and economics attended the meeting.

Participants at the meeting pointed out that the Emergency Appeal adopted at this Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers fully expresses the unshakable belief that "Vietnam will win, the U.S. imperialists will be defeated." All attendees unanimously support the statement issued by our government on July 3. They said that they are willing to take all measures, together with the Asian and African peoples and all countries and peoples in the world that truly oppose U.S. imperialism, to support the Vietnamese people's just war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The meeting also discussed how, in recent days, many Asian and African writers have enthusiastically praised our great leader Chairman Mao, highly evaluating the great significance and profound influence of Mao Zedong Thought in promoting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. Writers have expressed their boundless love and faith in the great Mao Zedong Thought, believing that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon for guiding the Asian and African peoples to oppose imperialism, old and new colonialism, and achieve thorough liberation. It is the beacon of the world revolution. This situation shows that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has closely united the hearts of the Asian and African peoples and all peoples of the world who want revolution. Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader and standard-bearer of the Asian and African peoples and all revolutionary peoples of the world. Everyone said that this situation is a great encouragement to the Chinese people. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, together with the Asian and African peoples and all revolutionary peoples of the world, carry the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism to the end until final victory.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 6th, a responsible person from the All-China Youth Federation spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter today about supporting the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, warmly hailing the great victory displayed by the conference, showing the unprecedented strength and unity of the Asian and African peoples' anti-imperialist forces.

The responsible person from the Youth Federation said that we are excited to see that this conference was held at a time when the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples and youth of the world are further deepening and developing. U.S. imperialism has already fallen into a situation where it is being beaten everywhere and is extremely isolated, and its paper tiger nature has been fully exposed. The savage bombing of the capital Hanoi and the second-largest city, Haiphong, by U.S. imperialism will not save it from its doomed fate. The helpers of U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist clique, who are implementing the line of U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world, are also heading towards complete bankruptcy.

The responsible person pointed out that the voices of unity and anti-imperialist struggle raised at this conference, the expressions of boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao, and the enthusiastic praise for Mao Zedong Thought are a great encouragement to the hundreds of millions of Chinese youth. We Chinese youth have deeply felt from our growth process: Mao Zedong Thought is the great banner guiding us from victory to victory in all our revolutionary work, the highest directive for all our work, and the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. The generation of Chinese youth nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought has boundless love, trust, and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought. Chinese youth, together with the people of the entire country, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participating in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and are determined to repel the ferocious attacks of the class enemy in this great revolutionary struggle, uproot the roots of revisionism, and resolutely temper ourselves into steadfast successors of the proletarian revolution.

The speech concluded by saying, let the peoples and youth of Asia and Africa, and the peoples and youth of all countries in the world, form the broadest and most genuine united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs and accomplices, closely combine the pen and the gun, and fight together to the end for the complete victory of the world anti-imperialist revolutionary cause!

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 6th, a responsible person from the All-China Students' Federation spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter today, warmly supporting the successful convening of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers.

The responsible person said: This conference fully expressed the firm stance of the peoples of Asian and African countries in resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. Chinese students, together with the peoples and students of Asian and African countries, strongly condemn the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism's savage bombing of the capital Hanoi and the second-largest city, Haiphong, of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and fully support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. At the same time, we firmly condemn the criminal activities of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, who are actively serving the "peace talks" plot of Johnson, betraying and sabotaging the great struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The responsible person said that many representatives attending the conference enthusiastically praised our great leader Chairman Mao and contemporary Marxism-Leninism's pinnacle—Mao Zedong Thought. Their speeches full of revolutionary enthusiasm fully reflected the boundless love of the peoples of Asian and African countries for Chairman Mao and their boundless yearning for Mao Zedong Thought. This makes us feel even more deeply: how fortunate are the Chinese youth growing up in the great era of Mao Zedong. Chinese students, together with the people of the entire country, will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively participate in the unprecedented, magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We, the students of the entire country, must, in this great class struggle, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, make Mao Zedong Thought deeply rooted in our minds, pass on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation, and forever be revolutionary, never degenerate.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 6th, the All-China Women's Federation wrote a letter to the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, expressing warm congratulations on behalf of more than 300 million Chinese women.

The letter expressed that all Chinese women firmly support the Emergency Appeal issued by the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers to the peoples of the world, resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people in defeating U.S. imperialism, and enthusiastically endorsing the statement issued by our government on July 3.

The congratulatory letter said that at present, our country is carrying out an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chinese women, together with the people of the entire country, are determined to thoroughly eliminate all the poisons of the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits created by the exploiting classes over thousands of years in this great struggle, and establish new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat.

The congratulatory letter said that at this conference, many representatives enthusiastically conveyed the deep affection of the Asian and African peoples for the Chinese people, their heartfelt admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao, and their boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought. This is a great support and encouragement to us. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of the Chinese people and women and the red sun in our hearts. We are determined to forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, regard Chairman Mao's words as the highest directive for all our work, forever follow Chairman Mao's teachings, and, together with the Asian and African peoples and all peoples of the world, form the broadest and most genuine anti-U.S. united front. We will contribute our greatest strength to opposing U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, supporting the just struggles of all oppressed nations and peoples, and for the complete victory of the world anti-imperialist revolutionary cause.

    谈话最后说，让亚非各国人民和青年、全世界各国人民和青年，结成最广泛、最真实的反对美帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶的统一战线，把笔杆子和枪杆子紧密结合起来，为世界反帝革命事业的彻底胜利而共同斗争到底！

    负责人说，参加会议的许多代表热情地歌颂我们伟大的领袖毛主席，歌颂当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想。他们的洋溢着革命热情的讲话充分反映出亚非各国人民对毛主席的无限热爱，对毛泽东思想的无限向往。这使我们更加深深地感到：生长在伟大的毛泽东时代的中国青年学生是多么幸福。中国学生将同全国人民一道，更高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加到轰轰烈烈的、史无前例的社会主义文化大革命中去。我们全国学生一定要在这场阶级斗争的大风大浪中活学活用毛泽东思想，使毛泽东思想更加牢固地在我们的头脑中扎下根，把战无不胜的毛泽东思想一代一代地传下去，永远革命，永不变质。
    据新华社六日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会，写信给亚非作家紧急会议，代表中国三亿多妇女向大会表示热烈祝贺。
    信中表示，全中国妇女坚决支持亚非作家紧急会议向全世界人民发出的坚决支援越南人民战胜美帝的紧急呼吁，热烈拥护我国政府七月三日发表的声明。

    贺信说，在这次会议上许多代表满怀热情地转达了亚非人民对中国人民的深情厚谊，对我们伟大领袖毛主席的衷心爱戴和对毛泽东思想的无比热爱，这对我们是极大的支持和鼓舞。伟大的毛泽东思想是中国人民和妇女的命根子，是我们心里的红太阳。我们决心永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把毛主席的话作为一切工作的最高指示，永远遵循毛主席的教导，同亚非人民和全世界人民结成最广泛、最真实的反美统一战线，为反对美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，支持一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民的正义斗争，贡献出自己最大的力量。
