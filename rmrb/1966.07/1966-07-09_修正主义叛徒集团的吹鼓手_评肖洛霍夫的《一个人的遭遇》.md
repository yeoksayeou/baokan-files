The editor of the *Liberation Army Daily* notes: Sholokhov is the pioneer of Soviet revisionist literature. In his early novel *And Quiet Flows the Don*, he went all out to glorify a blood-stained counter-revolutionary, Grigory. American publications therefore called him the "spiritual representative" of the "Don Cossacks who fought against the Red Army." After Khrushchev usurped the leadership of the Soviet Party and state, Sholokhov immediately threw himself into Khrushchev's arms, viciously attacking the man he had once called his "father," Stalin. He wholeheartedly served Khrushchev's revisionist political line, writing "The Fate of a Man," which propagates pacifism and capitulationism, and curses just wars. This poisonous weed, once hatched, was immediately hailed as a literary model by modern revisionists. Khrushchev personally praised it to the skies, even visiting Sholokhov's hometown to pay his respects, calling him the "chronicler of our great age" and taking him to the United States for a visit. Sholokhov, grateful for Khrushchev's recognition, vowed to "stand with him forever." He tirelessly promoted the philosophy of survival, actively advocating for cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, begging the American imperialists, "Let's come together! We have nothing to argue or fight about."

Recently, Sholokhov was sent by the new Soviet leadership to visit Japan. In Japan, he shamelessly said, "I like everything about Japan"; he even had the audacity to suggest that "Japanese young writers should marry the daughters of the rich" to ensure their "economic conditions."

Sholokhov also received recognition from Western capitalist countries. In October 1965, the Swedish Academy, which usually awards the Nobel Prize for Literature only to anti-communist writers, gave Sholokhov the prize. Eight years earlier, the Swedish Academy decided to award the so-called "anti-communist Nobel Prize" to the notorious reactionary novel "Doctor Zhivago" by Pasternak. Now, Sholokhov has taken the same "anti-communist prize" with both hands, fully exposing his traitorous face to the world.

Poisonous weeds must be uprooted, whether they are from China or abroad. Today, we publish an article criticizing Sholokhov's "The Fate of a Man," and in the future, we will continue to criticize this traitor's other reactionary works.

I. The Standard for Evaluating War Literature

War and peace are issues that concern people all over the world.

War and peace are themes that many writers have depicted.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "In dealing with literature and art, each class in a class society has different political standards and different artistic standards."

In dealing with literature that depicts war, the proletarian revolutionary faction and the bourgeois reactionary faction have diametrically opposed attitudes; Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and revisionism are diametrically opposed.

The Attitude of the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction

Lenin said: "The proletariat, both now and in the future, must always and unremittingly oppose war, but it has never forgotten that only the complete elimination of class divisions in society can eliminate war."

Chairman Mao said: "War—this monster of mutual slaughter among humans, the development of human society will ultimately eliminate it, and it will be eliminated in the not-too-distant future. But the method of eliminating it is only one: to use war against war, to use revolutionary war against counter-revolutionary war, to use national revolutionary war against national counter-revolutionary war, to use class revolutionary war against class counter-revolutionary war.... We study the laws of revolutionary war, starting from our desire to eliminate all wars, this is the line that distinguishes us communists from all exploiting classes."

Proletarian revolutionary writers, guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, from the perspective of class and class struggle, mercilessly expose the crimes of warmongers, oppose unjust wars; at the same time, they enthusiastically sing the praises of just wars, sing the praises of national liberation wars, sing the praises of proletarian revolutionary wars; especially enthusiastically sing the praises of the deepest power of revolutionary war—the people, sing the praises of revolutionary heroism that dares to fight and sacrifice blood. In depicting the hardships of war, they do not exaggerate suffering; in describing the brutality of war, they do not exaggerate terror. Instead, they enthusiastically sing the praises of the victory that revolutionary war brings to the people, sing the praises of the historical leap driven by revolutionary war.

Such literature is truly proletarian revolutionary literature.

The Attitude of the Revisionist Traitor Faction

In contrast to the proletarian revolutionary faction, revisionists, starting from the interests of the privileged class, indiscriminately oppose all wars. They believe: "There is no war that is not a misfortune" (traitor Kautsky's words). They treat revolutionary people with devilish threats on one hand and priestly deception on the other; on one hand, they shout that war will destroy "our Noah's Ark—the Earth" (Khrushchev's words); on the other hand, they whitewash American imperialism, sealing the warmongers as "angels of peace." In the face of the war crisis created by American imperialism, their "prescription" is: kowtow and surrender!

Revisionist traitor literature completely serves the political transactions of revisionism and imperialism. They slander the nature of revolutionary war; they distort the truth of revolutionary war. On the one hand, they exaggerate the terror and suffering of war; on the other hand, they promote bourgeois "pacifism." They slander and defame the deepest power of war—the people; they build monuments and write biographies for traitors. They openly forbid people's revolution and kneel to the enemy.

Such literature is a traitor's literature through and through.

We will use this standard to see how the Soviet writer Sholokhov, through his short novel "The Fate of a Man," answers the questions of the times. What kind of medicine is in this gourd? Let's see who Sholokhov really is.

II. Praising Egoism, Promoting the Philosophy of Survival

Evaluating a work, looking at what kind of person the protagonist is, and looking at the author's attitude towards the protagonist, is a hallmark.

"The Fate of a Man" focuses on a character named Sokolov.

In the Soviet literary circle, some people have praised Sokolov to the skies. What "noble spiritual world," what "many heroic deeds," what "Russian character," it's as if God has descended, the savior has risen!

Our view is completely the opposite.

Promoting Private Desire and Private Interest, Denying Revolutionary Ideals

Why does Sokolov live?

Answer: Alcohol, women, private property.

Sokolov is an alcoholic.

Sokolov said: "As soon as I get my pay, I go drinking with friends." He is drunk and staggering across the street, "making people watching from the side shudder."

Sokolov cannot live without women.

Sokolov praises his wife Irina: "There is no one more beautiful and satisfying than her." Without Irina, he loses his soul.

Sokolov is infatuated with private property.

He yearns for: "two rooms," "a pantry and a hallway," "two goats," a family with "clothes to wear, shoes to wear," and "porridge to eat" ... and nothing else. This is a lie! Today he yearns for "two rooms," tomorrow he will yearn for a big building; today he yearns for "two goats," tomorrow he will yearn for a pasture. Such an extreme egoist, with no revolutionary ideals and no concern for others, his desires are never satisfied.

Private desire and private interest, the highest goal. This is what Sholokhov vigorously promotes as the so-called "noble spiritual world," this is the true meaning of Sokolov's worldview.

We believe: Only by gaining the great ideal of communism and establishing a proletarian worldview can a revolutionary produce revolutionary actions and persist in them. We believe: People live to serve the laboring people of the world, to promote and complete the revolutionary cause of the world proletariat, not for personal desires and interests. Only such a person is a noble person. Only such a person can withstand any test of the environment. Only such a person can fight bravely in a just war. Only such a person can drive the wheel of human history forward, playing the role of a gear and a screw.

Beautifying Traitor Scum, Promoting Surrender

How does Sokolov live?

Answer: Fear of death, survival first; willing to be a dog, sell out to the enemy.

The fire of the Patriotic War tested who is steel and who is dross. Sokolov is a coward.

When he found himself surrounded by the enemy, he did not try to break out and advance, but "his legs went weak, and his body fell down like a bundle of cut grass."

Under the gun of the Nazi fascist bandits, this lightly wounded man, instead of rushing up to fight to the death with the enemy, let out a silent moan: "Oh, my end has come!"

The Nazi thugs liked his boots, so he obediently took them off, even offering his foot wrappings, kneeling to live.

The Nazi camp commander gave an order, and he obediently went to the office to report.

The Nazi camp commander gave him a cup of alcohol, and he immediately said, "Thank you for your hospitality," and "picked up the glass and gulped it down in two swallows."

Even more despicable, this drunkard, using the excuse of not eating anything with the first and second cups of alcohol, begged the Nazi camp commander to give him three large cups in a row.

Mr. Sholokhov, you trample on the dignity of the Russian nation, step on it again and again, and yet you say you are singing its praises. Don't you feel ashamed? Isn't this face, willing to sell his soul for alcohol and meat, just like a dog wagging its tail to the master?

Sokolov is a dog of the Nazis.

This dog treats the Nazis' insults as "joy" ...

This dog obeys orders to work for the Nazis, driving a car for the Nazi lieutenant ...

This dog is very satisfied with the life of driving for the Nazis, eating the "piece" of meat thrown to him by the Nazi lieutenant when he is in a good mood ...

Sokolov has betrayed the honor of the soldier, betrayed his country. Sokolov is not a hero at all, but a traitor who sells out to the enemy.

Sholokhov enthusiastically praises such a person.

× × ×

Sholokhov went to great lengths to create this traitor and seal him as a hero, for what?

It's very clear, he wants people to follow Sokolov's example. He tries to make people not oppose imperialism, not resist the war of aggression; he tries to make people, for "alcohol, women, private property," kneel to the executioner: what use is integrity, the head is the most important.

Sholokhov breaks the proletarian worldview and establishes the bourgeois worldview; breaks revolutionary heroism and establishes the philosophy of survival.

In the face of the war threat of American imperialism, he poisons and anesthetizes all revolutionary people and the next generation, wanting them and their descendants to be able to "endure everything" like Sokolov.

Who benefits and who suffers from this, isn't it as clear as water?

The proletarian revolutionary faction resolutely condemns this despicable act.

The proletarian revolutionary faction believes:

A true warrior, in the face of the enemy's aggression, is fearless and opposes it.

A true warrior considers being a prisoner of war shameful. He must dare to face the enemy's gun, fight bravely.

A true warrior would rather eat grass than beg a grain of food from the enemy.

A true warrior would rather die standing than live kneeling.

Victory belongs to the revolutionary people who dare to fight and are good at fighting.

III. Denying Just War, Forbidding People's Revolution

All reactionary ideologues habitually use the trick of calling a deer a horse, mixing fish eyes with pearls, deliberately distorting the truth of things to prove their absurd points. All reactionary literature is the same.

"The Fate of a Man," set against the backdrop of the great Soviet Patriotic War, is the fiery era of fighting against fascist bandits. How does Sholokhov depict such a great just war, such a fiery era?

Beautifying Fascist Bandits, Defaming Soviet Soldiers and Civilians

Lenin said: "Imperialism is war."

Chairman Mao said: "War—from the beginning of private property and class, it is a form of the highest struggle to resolve the contradictions between classes and classes, nations and nations, states and states, political groups and political groups, at a certain stage of development."

The class nature and reactionary policies of Hitler's fascist bandits determine that they must provoke war, determine that they must impose war on the people, and bring the war to Soviet territory.

Hitler's fascist bandits are insatiable plunderers, bloodthirsty executioners.

"The Fate of a Man" does not reveal this essence at all, but lets Sokolov say: "Oh, life, life, why do you torture me so? Why do you punish me? Whether it's night or day, there is no answer..."

A few words completely erase the class nature of war, wiping out the crimes of Hitler's fascist bandits in making war, as if it were just some inexplicable, eternal fate.

At the end of the novel, Sholokhov himself appears to say: "Two people who have lost their loved ones, two people who have been thrown into a foreign land by an unprecedentedly fierce war storm..." "The fierce war storm" exactly what does it mean, is it the fascist war of aggression? Or is it the Soviet people's war of resistance? This is completely an excuse for the murderer Hitler, a malicious defamation of the heroic Soviet soldiers and civilians.

In the novel, the image of the Soviet Red Army is mainly a group of deserters and a group of prisoners captured by the fascists.

Only a group of retreating soldiers "running on the fields on both sides of the road" is seen.

Only a group of prisoners, working for the German devils, are never seen resisting.

Only a group of prisoners, using thread to cut "the piece of bread given to Sokolov by the German devils," even "counting every crumb."

From these Red Army soldiers, there is not a trace of the brilliance of Marxism-Leninism, not a trace of brave and tenacious character. The only party member (political instructor) is like a pitiful creature, begging the traitor not to "betray" him.

This is a malicious defamation of the Soviet Red Army.

The novel does not touch on the people's support for the war at all, and not even a trace of the common people can be found in the occupied area. Occasionally mentioning the laboring women in the rear, it is completely in a very frivolous tone, saying they are "unlucky," they will "drop their hands" as soon as they receive a "complaint" letter from the front, "and will have no heart to work anymore."

The heroic Soviet people will not tolerate this malicious defamation.

In the great Patriotic War, the heroic Soviet soldiers and civilians have made immortal contributions to the revolution. As Chairman Mao said in "In Commemoration of the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of the October Revolution": "... The Red Army soldiers have accomplished heroic deeds related to the fate of all mankind. They are the children of the October Revolution. The banner of the October Revolution is invincible."

The Chinese people and the people of the world will forever condemn the crimes of the fascist bandits, making them infamous forever; forever praise the heroic people in the Soviet Patriotic War under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, wishing them to be remembered for a thousand generations!

Praising the Misery of War, Intimidating Revolutionary People

The great Soviet Patriotic War, in "The Fate of a Man," is a miserable beginning, a miserable end.

When the soldiers set off for the front, there is no sound of battle, nor is there a high-flying battle flag. What is seen is the parents and wives sending them off, pulling at their clothes and weeping loudly. Women have "swollen lips," and every word they speak is choked with sobs: "This life... we... will... never... see again!" Men have "hearts torn to pieces," and even after many years, when they think of it, it is as if "something" is pressing down on them, making them "unable to breathe."

The war is over. There is no victory cheer, nor is there any grand ambition for the revolutionary future. There is only: "unlucky days," "rotting boats," "blocked traffic," "fallen fences." On the day of victory, Sokolov's son's coffin appears, burying "the last joy and hope."

In Sholokhov's pen, victory is death.

Look, in this short novel, three orphans appear.

Through the design of the "three orphans," Sholokhov draws a ridiculous conclusion about the great October Revolution and the Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, that is: the result of revolutionary war can only be the destruction of families, the appearance of a world of orphans.

Who doesn't know that it is the great October Revolution that produced the Soviet Socialist Republic; it is the great October Revolution that spread Marxism-Leninism to the world.

Who doesn't know that it is the great Patriotic War that saved the Soviet people from danger, defeated the invincible fascist bandits. It is the great Patriotic War that made a great historical contribution to the future and destiny of the world people.

Mr. Sholokhov: Your depiction is completely contrary to historical truth. You maliciously beat the great October Revolution and the Patriotic War to death with one stick, why?

You use the exaggeration of war misery to intimidate the people, trying to induce people to walk your revisionist road of surrender.

The proletarian revolutionary faction believes: When American imperialism sends troops, or uses lackeys, to carry out bloody massacres against oppressed nations and oppressed peoples, national liberation wars are inevitable.

When the bourgeois reactionaries use force to suppress their own people, and carry out inhuman counter-revolutionary dictatorship against the proletariat, domestic revolutionary wars are inevitable.

Marx said: "It is either struggle or death; it is either a bloody struggle or destruction. The question is posed in this way."

Indeed, due to the aggression and oppression of imperialism, war will inevitably break some pots and pans, and cause some sacrifices. But for the liberation of all progressive humanity, for the elimination of all harmful insects, it is completely necessary and worthwhile.

Chairman Mao said: "The banner of human justice war is a banner to save humanity," "it is a bridge to turn the history of the world to a new era."

The victory of the Soviet Patriotic War, the victory of the Chinese revolutionary war, completely proves this scientific proposition. Today, the revolutionary struggles in the vast regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are also proving this scientific proposition.

All the war intimidations of imperialism and modern revisionism cannot stop the tide of the world's revolutionary people fighting for liberation.

IV. "Three-in-One" Are All Traitors

"The Fate of a Man" is not some new thing.

A Japanese bourgeois critic said: "The path that the soldier Sokolov walked, his fate, is nothing new... This is a familiar theme, a familiar story. While watching 'The Fate of a Man,' I gradually felt bored..."

Since this is the case, why did Khrushchev immediately hail it as a treasure, making a movie, giving a "big award," and elevating Sholokhov to a "Central Committee member of the CPSU," even running to his house to celebrate his birthday?

There is a secret here.

Birds of a feather flock together, and so do those with similar stench.

Uncovering this secret is not difficult, just follow the line of Sokolov—Sholokhov—Khrushchev, and you will understand.

First, look at Sokolov and Sholokhov.

Sokolov curses all wars for the sake of survival.

Sholokhov has repeatedly shouted, "Intellectuals should first say 'no' to war, and say it before those who say 'yes.'"

Sokolov, for the sake of survival, eats the bones thrown by the Nazis like a dog.

Sholokhov, in 1965, wagged his tail and accepted the "Nobel Prize for Literature" from the Western monopoly bourgeoisie.

Look, Sholokhov and Sokolov in his pen, their spiritual worlds are so harmonious, so consistent!

Next, look at Sholokhov and Khrushchev.

They both, in the Stalin era, called Stalin their "father."

They both, after Stalin's death, one played intrigues, usurped the party and the country, and delivered a report attacking Stalin at the 20th Congress of the CPSU; the other immediately wielded his pen, writing the first piece of "thaw" literature—"The Fate of a Man."

They both visited the United States. One advocated cooperation among world leaders, and the other advocated world writers' conferences, master and servant, singing in harmony, fitting together perfectly.

Sholokhov praised his "Chairman of the Council of Ministers," proposing a revisionist program as "an indestructible monument."

Khrushchev praised his "writer" for writing "The Fate of a Man," calling it an "excellent short novel."

Sholokhov praised Khrushchev because Khrushchev proposed the program of building "communism with beef and potatoes," proposed the counter-revolutionary line of "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful transition," and "peaceful competition," which perfectly suited his highest purpose in life.

Khrushchev loved Sholokhov because Sholokhov created a typical figure like Sokolov, providing spiritual ammunition for him to promote the revisionist program, and doing ideological preparation for him to complete a set of revisionist programs at the 22nd Congress.

The matter is clear: Khrushchev—Sholokhov—Sokolov, are originally "three-in-one." Although their ages and positions are different, their souls are the same, all are traitors to the revolution.

A futile attempt to block the chariot with an arm

Khrushchev said: "We (the United States and the Soviet Union) are both the strongest countries in the world. If we unite for peace, then there will be no war." He also said: "If some madman wants to start a war, we just need to scare him with a finger, and he will quiet down."

The criminal purpose of the Khrushchev revisionist clique is to unite with the world's number one enemy, American imperialism, to collude and scheme, trying to rule the world. They only allow American imperialism to invade and kill everywhere, but do not allow people to take up arms and defend themselves.

The Khrushchev revisionist line is a line that adapts to the "global strategy" of American imperialism.

Sholokhov and the Sokolov he created, tightly serve the Khrushchev revisionist line, serve American imperialism.

Thus, the spokesmen of the Western monopoly bourgeoisie praised Khrushchev as the "best prime minister"; praised Sokolov as a great artistic type; awarded Sholokhov the "Nobel Prize."

The Western monopoly bourgeoisie is very clear: fortresses are easiest to be broken from within. Sholokhov, as a writer with the label of the Central Committee of the CPSU, starts the white flag rebellion from within the people, in the field of ideology, uses literary forms to carry out counter-revolutionary, anti-people activities. Such traitor literature can indeed play a special role that no imperialist literature can play.

This is the fundamental reason why a "familiar theme," a novel that makes people "feel bored," suddenly appears in the pen of a traitor, and its value can increase a hundredfold. This is the secret of why it is particularly valued and praised by the modern revisionist clique and the Western monopoly bourgeoisie.

The mask is torn off, the true face is revealed. Sholokhov is a blowhard for the revisionist clique, serving American imperialism!

"The Fate of a Man" is a specimen of revisionist traitor literature.

The wheels of time roll forward unceasingly. Khrushchev has long been expelled from the political stage and has been spat on by the people. Although Sholokhov is still under the banner of the Soviet revisionist clique, fangs and claws, opposing the revolution, his soul is filthy, and the stench is overwhelming, historical retribution is inevitable!

Down with the revisionist philosophy of survival!

Long live the victory of people's war!

    修正主义叛徒集团的吹鼓手——评肖洛霍夫的《一个人的遭遇》
    广军
    《解放军报》编者按：肖洛霍夫是苏联修正主义文学鼻祖。在他早年写作的长篇小说《静静的顿河》中，就极力歌颂一个血债累累的反革命分子葛利高里。美国的报刊因此称他为“那些攻打过红军的顿河哥萨克人”的精神上的“代表”。赫鲁晓夫篡夺了苏联党和国家的领导权以后，肖洛霍夫立刻投进赫鲁晓夫的怀抱，恶毒地攻击他曾经称呼为“生身父亲”的斯大林。他死心塌地地为赫鲁晓夫修正主义政治路线服务，写出了宣扬和平主义和投降主义、诅咒正义战争的《一个人的遭遇》。这株大毒草一出笼，就被现代修正主义者奉为文学的标本。赫鲁晓夫亲自为之大吹大擂，特意到肖洛霍夫的家乡登门拜访，封他为“我们这个伟大时代的编年史家”，把他带往美国去访问。肖洛霍夫对于赫鲁晓夫的赏识感激涕零，发誓说“将永远和他站在一起”。他拚命宣扬活命哲学，积极鼓吹苏美实行文化合作，向美帝国主义乞求说：“让我们互相往来吧！我们没有什么可争论和斗争的。”
    不久前，肖洛霍夫又被苏共新领导派往日本访问。在日本，他无耻地说，“对日本的一切都喜欢”；居然厚着脸皮建议“日本的青年作家同富翁的女儿结婚”，以保证写作的“经济条件”。
    肖洛霍夫也受到了西方资本主义国家的赏识。一九六五年十月，瑞典科学院把一向只授给反共作家的诺贝尔文学奖金，赏给了肖洛霍夫。八年以前，瑞典科学院决定把这笔被称为“反对共产主义的诺贝尔奖金”，授给臭名昭著的反动小说《日瓦戈医生》的作者帕斯捷尔纳克。现在肖洛霍夫双手接过了这笔同样的“反共的奖金”，这就把他自己的叛徒面目，完全暴露在世界人民面前了。
    是毒草就要坚决铲除，不管是中国的还是外国的。今天我们发表了批判肖洛霍夫《一个人的遭遇》的文章，以后还将继续批判这个叛徒的其它反动的作品。
    一、评价描写战争文学的标准
    战争与和平，全世界人民都在关注着这一问题。
    战争与和平，许多作家都在描写着这一主题。
    毛主席指出：对待文学艺术，“各个阶级社会中的各个阶级都有不同的政治标准和不同的艺术标准”。
    对待描写战争的文学，无产阶级革命派和资产阶级反动派，两者的态度针锋相对；马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想和修正主义，两种思想水火不容。
    无产阶级革命派的态度
    列宁说：“无产阶级无论现在或将来都要始终不懈地反对战争，但它一分钟也没有忘记，只有完全消灭社会划分为阶级的现象，才可能消灭战争。”
    毛主席说：“战争——这个人类互相残杀的怪物，人类社会的发展终久要把它消灭的，而且就在不远的将来会要把它消灭的。但是消灭它的方法只有一个，就是用战争反对战争，用革命战争反对反革命战争，用民族革命战争反对民族反革命战争，用阶级革命战争反对阶级反革命战争。……我们研究革命战争的规律，出发于我们要求消灭一切战争的志愿，这是区别我们共产党人和一切剥削阶级的界线。”
    无产阶级革命派作家，以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指南，从阶级和阶级斗争的观点出发，无情地揭露战争狂人的罪恶，反对非正义的战争；同时，又满腔热情地歌颂正义的战争，歌颂民族解放战争，歌颂无产阶级革命战争；特别满腔热情地歌颂革命战争最深厚的伟力——人民群众，歌颂革命战争中敢打敢拚、不惜牺牲流血的革命英雄主义。在表现战争的艰苦性时，不渲染苦难；在描写战争的残酷性时，不渲染恐怖。而是满腔热情地歌颂革命战争给人民带来的胜利果实，歌颂由于革命战争所带动的历史的飞跃。
    这样的文学，才是真正的无产阶级革命文学。
    修正主义叛徒的态度
    同无产阶级革命派相反，修正主义者从维护特权集团的私利出发，不加区别地反对一切战争。他们认为：“没有一次战争不是一种不幸”（叛徒考茨基语）。他们对待革命人民，一面是魔鬼般的恫吓，一面是牧师似的欺骗；一面狂喊着战争会毁灭“自己的诺亚方舟——地球”（赫鲁晓夫语）；一面为美帝国主义涂脂抹粉，把战争狂人封为“和平的天使”。在美帝国主义制造的战争危机面前，他们开出的“药方”是：卑躬屈膝，变节投降！
    修正主义的叛徒文学，完全为修正主义和帝国主义的政治交易效劳。他们对革命战争的性质，肆意诽谤；对革命战争的真相，横加歪曲。一方面渲染战争的恐怖和苦难；一方面鼓吹资产阶级“和平主义”。对战争最深厚的伟力——人民群众，他们极力污蔑丑化；对叛徒，他们为其立碑写传。公开不准人民革命，向敌人屈膝投降。
    这样的文学，是不折不扣的叛徒文学。
    我们就用这个标准，来看看苏联作家肖洛霍夫，是怎样通过他的短篇小说《一个人的遭遇》，回答时代的提问呢。《一个人的遭遇》这个葫芦里究竟卖的是什么药，来看看肖洛霍夫，究竟是个什么人。
    二、歌颂利己主义，宣扬活命哲学
    衡量一篇作品，看主人公是何等样人，看作者对主人公是什么态度，是一个标帜。
    小说《一个人的遭遇》，重点描写的就是名叫索科洛夫的“这一个”。
    对于索科洛夫“这一个”，苏联文艺界里的一些人，把他捧上了天。什么崇高的“精神世界”呀，众多的“英雄行为”呀，是“俄罗斯的性格”呀，简直如同上帝下凡，救世主复活！
    我们的看法却完全相反。
    提倡私欲私利，否定革命理想
    索科洛夫为什么而活着？
    答：酒，女人，私财。
    索科洛夫是个酒徒。
    索科洛夫说：“一领到工资，我就和朋友去喝酒”。他烂醉如泥，踉跄过街，“叫人在旁边看着都心惊胆战”。
    索科洛夫离了女人不能活。
    索科洛夫夸他的老婆伊林娜：“天下没有比她更漂亮更称心的人了”。离了伊林娜，他就失了魂。
    索科洛夫，迷恋私财。
    他一心向往的是：“两个房间”，“贮藏室和走廊”，“两只山羊”，一家人“有衣服穿，有鞋子穿”，有“牛奶糊”吃……此外就“什么也不需要了”。这是骗人！今天向往“两个房间”，明天必向往一座大楼，今天向往“两只山羊”，明天必向往一片牧场。似这种毫无革命理想、毫无他人的极端利己主义者，他的私欲是永难满足的。
    私欲私利，最高目的。这就是肖洛霍夫极力倡导的所谓“崇高的精神世界”，这就是索科洛夫人生观的真意。
    我们认为：革命者只有获得了共产主义的伟大理想，树立了无产阶级的世界观，才能产生革命的行动，并坚持不渝。我们认为：人活着是为了替天下劳动人民服务，为了推进和完成世界无产阶级的革命事业，决不是为了个人的私欲私利。只有这样的人，才是一个高尚的人。只有这样的人，才能经受住任何环境的考验。只有这样的人，才能在正义战争中英勇战斗。只有这样的人，才能为推动人类历史的车轮，起到一个齿轮和螺丝钉的作用。
    美化叛徒败类，鼓吹卖身投敌
    索科洛夫是怎样生活的呢？
    答：贪生怕死，保命第一；甘当走狗，卖身投敌。
    卫国战争的烈火，考验出谁是钢铁，谁是渣滓。索科洛夫，是个怕死鬼。
    当他发现落在敌人包围圈里时，不是设法突围，赶队向前，而是“两腿发软，身子就象一束割下的草那样倒下来”。
    在德国法西斯强盗的枪口下，这位仅仅是胳膊脱臼的轻伤号，不是扑上去和敌人拚个你死我活，而是发出无声的哀鸣：“嗐，我的末日到啦！”
    法西斯匪徒看中了他的靴子，他就恭顺地把靴子脱下来，甚至献上包脚布，屈膝求生。
    法西斯集中营营长一声令下，他就俯首贴耳，去到办公室立正报到。
    法西斯营长赏他一杯酒，他马上说，“谢谢您的招待”，“拿起玻璃杯，咕嘟咕嘟两口就喝了下去”。
    尤其卑鄙的是，这个酒鬼，竟然以喝第一杯、第二杯酒不吃东西为名，乞求法西斯营长，接连赏了他三大杯。
    肖洛霍夫先生，你把俄罗斯民族的尊严，踏在脚下，踩了又踩，还硬说你是在歌颂它，你不觉得脸红吗？难道你不觉得这一副为了酒肉，不惜出卖灵魂的嘴脸，就是向着主子摇尾乞怜的狗吗？
    索科洛夫，就是法西斯的一条狗。
    这条狗，把法西斯的辱骂，当做“快乐”……
    这条狗，唯命是从地替法西斯干活，去给法西斯少校开汽车……
    这条狗，非常满意给法西斯开车的生活，吃着法西斯少校“情绪好”时抛给他的“一块”肉……
    索科洛夫，出卖了战士的荣誉，出卖了他的祖国。索科洛夫，决不是什么英雄，而是卖身投敌的叛徒。
    肖洛霍夫竭力赞美的，就是这样的一个人。

    肖洛霍夫费尽心机，塑造这个叛徒，并封为英雄好汉，是为着什么呢？
    明白得很，他是要人们向索科洛夫看齐。企图叫人们不要反对帝国主义，不要反抗侵略战争；企图叫人们为了“酒、女人、私财”，去向刽子手叩头：气节顶啥用，脑袋最要紧。
    肖洛霍夫破的是无产阶级世界观，立的是资产阶级世界观；破的是革命英雄主义，立的是活命哲学。
    在美帝国主义的战争威胁面前，他对一切革命的人民和下一代，放毒瓦斯，打麻醉剂，要让他们和他们的儿孙，也象索科洛夫那样：“能够忍受一切”。
    这到底对谁有利，对谁不利，岂不是一碗清水看到底了吗？
    无产阶级革命派，坚决谴责这种卑劣的勾当。
    无产阶级革命派认为：
    真正的战士，对待敌人的侵略，一是不怕，二是反对。
    真正的战士，认为当俘虏是可耻的。要敢于面对敌人的枪口，奋勇搏斗。
    真正的战士，宁愿食青草过活，也决不向仇敌乞讨一粒粮食。
    真正的战士，宁愿站着死，决不跪着生。
    胜利属于敢于斗争、善于斗争的革命人民。
    三、否定正义战争，不准人民革命
    一切反动思想的传道士，惯用指鹿为马、鱼目混珠的伎俩，专门歪曲事物的真相，以便为他们的荒谬论点做证。一切反动的文学，也是这样。
    《一个人的遭遇》，背景是伟大的苏联卫国战争，是那个如火如荼的反法西斯强盗的火红的时代。对于这样一个伟大的正义战争，对于这样一个火红的时代，肖洛霍夫又是怎样描写的呢？
    美化法西斯强盗，丑化苏联军民
    列宁说：“帝国主义就是战争”。
    毛主席说：“战争——从有私有财产和有阶级以来就开始了的、用以解决阶级和阶级、民族和民族、国家和国家、政治集团和政治集团之间、在一定发展阶段上的矛盾的一种最高的斗争形式。”
    希特勒法西斯强盗的阶级本质和反动政策，决定他要挑起战争，决定他要把战争强加在人民的头上，把战火烧到了苏联领土。
    希特勒法西斯强盗，是贪得无厌的掠夺者，是嗜血成性的刽子手。
    《一个人的遭遇》，完全不揭示这一本质，却让索科洛夫说道：“唉，生活，生活，你究竟为什么要那样折磨我？为什么要那样惩罚我？不论黑夜，不论白天，都得不到解答……”
    几句话，完全抹煞了战争的阶级性，把希特勒法西斯制造战争的罪恶，一笔勾销，似乎只是一种莫名其妙的、永远不能解答的命运在作祟。
    在小说的尾部，肖洛霍夫更亲自出面说：“两个失去亲人的人，两个被空前强烈的战争风暴抛到异乡的砂子……”。“强烈战争的风暴”究竟是什么意思，是法西斯的侵略战争呢？还是苏联人民的卫国战争？这完全是为杀人的罪魁祸首希特勒开脱，对英雄的苏联军民进行恶毒诽谤。
    小说中苏联红军的形象，主要是一群败兵和一群被法西斯抓去的俘虏。
    只见一群溃退的战士，“在大路两边的原野上跑着”。
    只见一群俘虏，为德寇干活，从不见反抗。
    只见一群俘虏，用麻线切开“德寇赏赐给索科洛夫的一块面包”，“连一块面包屑”都要“计算”。
    从这些红军战士身上，看不见丝毫马克思列宁主义的光辉，看不见丝毫英勇顽强的气质。仅有的一个党员（指导员），却象个可怜虫，苦苦哀求叛徒不要“出卖”他。
    这是对苏联红军的恶毒诽谤。
    小说根本没触及人民对战争的支援，甚至在沦陷区，连老百姓的影子也找不到一个。偶尔提到后方的劳动妇女，完全是用一种极其轻薄的口吻，说她们是“倒霉的”，她们只要接到一封“诉苦”的前方来信，“就会垂下双手，再也没心思干活了”。
    英雄的苏联人民，决不会忍受这恶毒的诽谤。
    卫国战争中伟大的苏联军民，为革命立下了不朽的功劳。正如毛主席在《祝十月革命二十五周年》一文中说的：“……红军战士做出了有关全人类命运的英雄事业。他们是十月革命的儿女。十月革命的旗帜是不可战胜的”。
    中国人民、全世界人民，永远谴责法西斯强盗的罪恶，让他们遗臭万年；永远颂扬在列宁、斯大林旗帜下的苏联卫国战争中的英雄人民，愿他们流芳千载！
    颂扬战争苦难，恫吓革命人民
    苏联伟大的卫国战争，在《一个人的遭遇》中，是凄凄惨惨的开始，凄凄惨惨的结束。
    当战士们开赴前线时，既不闻战斗的号角，更不见高扬的战旗。见到的却是送行的爹娘妻子，牵衣顿足，哭声震天。女人是“嘴唇哭肿了”，每说一字，呜咽一下：“今世……再也……看……看不到了”！男人是“心被撕成了碎片”，直到多年以后，一想起来就象“有样东西”压得他“喘不过气来”。
    战争结束了。既没有胜利的欢呼，也没有对革命未来的壮志。有的是：“倒霉的日子”，“腐烂的小船”，“阻塞的交通”，“倒下的篱笆”。在胜利日的那天，出现了索科洛夫的儿子的棺材，埋葬了“最后的欢乐和希望”。
    在肖洛霍夫的笔下，胜利就是死亡。
    看，就在这短短的一篇小说中，竟然出现了三个孤儿。
    肖洛霍夫通过“三个孤儿”的设计，对苏联伟大的十月革命和卫国战争，做出荒谬绝伦的结论，那就是：革命战争的结果，只能是家破人亡，出现孤儿的世界。
    谁不知道，是伟大的十月革命，产生了苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟；是伟大的十月革命，给全世界人民播送了马克思列宁主义。
    谁不知道，是伟大的卫国战争，挽救了苏联人民的危亡，击败了不可一世的法西斯强盗。是伟大的卫国战争，为世界人民的前途和命运，作出了具有伟大历史意义的贡献。
    肖洛霍夫先生：你的描写是完全违背历史真实的。你刻毒地把伟大的十月革命和卫国战争一棍子打死，到底为什么？
    你是以夸大的战争苦难，来恫吓人民，妄想诱使人们走你们的修正主义的卖身投敌的黑路。
    无产阶级革命派认为：当美帝国主义派出军队，或者利用走狗，对被压迫民族和被压迫人民实行血腥屠杀的时候，民族解放战争是不可避免的。
    当资产阶级反动派，用武力来镇压本国的人民，对无产阶级实行惨绝人寰的反革命专政的时候，国内革命战争是不可避免的。
    马克思说：“不是战斗，就是死亡；不是血战，就是毁灭。问题的提法必然如此。”
    诚然，由于帝国主义的侵略和镇压，战争必然要打破一些坛坛罐罐，要造成一些牺牲。但是为了整个进步人类的解放，为了消灭一切害人虫，是完全应该，也完全值得的。
    毛主席说：“人类正义战争的旗帜是拯救人类的旗帜”，“是把全世界历史转到新时代的桥梁”。
    苏联卫国战争的胜利，中国革命战争的胜利，完全证实了这一科学的论断。今天亚、非、拉美广大地区的革命斗争，也正在证实着这一科学的论断。
    一切一切帝国主义、现代修正主义的战争恫吓，决阻挡不住全世界革命人民争取解放的洪流。
    四、“三夫”一体全是叛徒
    《一个人的遭遇》，并不是什么新鲜货色。
    日本一位资产阶级评论家说：“士兵索科洛夫所走过的道路，他的命运，也不是什么新的东西……这是司空见惯的主题，司空见惯的故事。在看着《一个人的遭遇》的时候，我渐渐感到倦怠了……”
    既然如此，为什么它一出笼，赫鲁晓夫就把它捧为至宝，又是拍电影，又是发“大奖”，又把肖洛霍夫跃升为“苏共中央委员”，还跑到他家里去祝寿呢？
    这里面有个秘密。
    物以类聚臭味相投
    揭开这个秘密并不难，只要沿着索科洛夫——肖洛霍夫——赫鲁晓夫这条线，看一看就了然了。
    先看索科洛夫和肖洛霍夫。
    索科洛夫为了活命，咒骂一切战争。
    肖洛霍夫不止一次地叫嚷，“知识分子应该首先对战争说：‘不要’，而且要比那些‘要’的人说在前头。”
    索科洛夫为了活命，象狗一样啃着法西斯扔给的骨头。
    肖洛霍夫一九六五年摇着尾巴接受了西方垄断资产阶级的“诺贝尔文学奖金”。
    请看，肖洛霍夫和他笔下的索科洛夫，精神世界是多么和谐，多么一致！
    再看，肖洛霍夫和赫鲁晓夫。
    他们俩，同是在斯大林时代，称斯大林为“生身父亲”的人物。
    他们俩，在斯大林逝世之后，一个是玩弄阴谋，篡党、篡国，在苏共二十大发表了攻击斯大林的报告；一个是连忙挥舞秃笔，写出了“解冻”文学的第一篇——《一个人的遭遇》。
    他们俩，同行访问美国。一个主张世界首脑合作于前，一个提倡世界作家会谈于后，一主一仆，一唱一和，丝丝入扣。
    肖洛霍夫吹捧他的“部长会议主席”，提出的修正主义纲领是“一座不可摧毁的纪念碑”。
    赫鲁晓夫褒奖他的“作家”写出的《一个人的遭遇》，是“卓越的短篇小说”。
    肖洛霍夫吹捧赫鲁晓夫，是因为赫鲁晓夫提出了建设“牛肉加土豆”的“共产主义”纲领，提出了“和平共处”“和平过渡”“和平竞赛”的反革命路线，正好迎合了他的人生最高目的。
    赫鲁晓夫爱肖洛霍夫，是因为肖洛霍夫塑造了索科洛夫这样一个典型，为他推行修正主义纲领，提供了精神炮弹，为他在二十二大完成一整套修正主义纲领，做了舆论准备。
    事情再清楚不过了，赫鲁晓夫——肖洛霍夫——索科洛夫，原是“三夫”一体。虽然他们的年龄、职务各不相同，而灵魂完全一样，都是革命的叛徒。
    螳臂挡车枉费心机
    赫鲁晓夫说：“我们（美苏两国）都是世界上最强大的国家，如果我们为和平而联合起来，那么就不会有战争。”又说：“如果有某个疯子想挑起战争，我们只要用手指吓唬他一下，就足以使他安静下来。”
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的罪恶目的，就是要同世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义“联合起来”，狼狈为奸，妄图称王称霸，主宰世界。只许美帝国主义到处侵略，到处杀人，不许人民拿起武器，还手自卫。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线，是适应美帝国主义“全球战略”的路线。
    肖洛霍夫和由他塑造的索科洛夫，又紧紧为赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线服务，为美帝国主义效劳。
    于是，西方垄断资产阶级的代言人，夸奖赫鲁晓夫是“最好的总理”；赞扬索科洛夫是伟大的艺术典型；赏以肖洛霍夫“诺贝尔奖金”。
    西方垄断资产阶级很清楚：堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的。肖洛霍夫作为一个挂着苏共中央委员招牌的作家，从人民内部打起白旗造反，在意识形态的领域里，用文学的形式，来进行反革命、反人民的勾当。这样的叛徒文学，确实能起到任何帝国主义文学所不能起到的特殊作用。
    这就是一个“司空见惯”的主题，一篇使人“感到倦怠”的小说，突然出现在叛徒笔下，就能身价百倍的根本原因。这就是它受到现代修正主义集团、西方垄断资产阶级特别重视和颂扬的秘密所在。
    画皮剥去，原形毕露。肖洛霍夫是为修正主义集团效劳、为美帝国主义效劳的吹鼓手！
    《一个人的遭遇》，是一个修正主义叛徒文学的标本。
    时代的车轮不停地向前转动。赫鲁晓夫早已滚出了政治舞台，受到了人民的唾弃。肖洛霍夫虽然还在苏联修正主义集团的麾下，张牙舞爪，反对革命，但灵魂龌龊，臭气冲天，历史惩罚，决难逃脱！
    打倒修正主义活命哲学！
    人民战争胜利万岁！
