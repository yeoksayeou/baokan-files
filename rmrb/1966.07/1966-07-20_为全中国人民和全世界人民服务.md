I am a youth and a soldier of the people. I think of the oppressed people in the places that have not yet been liberated. If one only sees the beauty of one's own youth and does not see the youth and happiness of others, then one should give oneself a warning.

When the Party needs me, I am willing to give everything. Please, Party, trust me and test my promise!

The most beautiful wish is to connect one's ideals and aspirations with the destiny of the motherland and to combine them with the happiness of the people. In this way, a person can continuously advance!

Strive to forge oneself into a communist warrior and fight for the cause of communism!

		May 1964

Chairman Mao said that one should learn from the revolutionary forebears who were willing to sacrifice their heads and shed blood for the revolution.

Those who contribute everything for the revolution are true human beings. Whether I can become such a person remains to be tested in practice. I truly feel that "practice is the touchstone of truth." I will be tested by practice.

Look! In the future, I will definitely strive to do more meaningful things for the revolutionary cause. I will dedicate my life to the revolutionary struggle. Only in this way can I say at the moment of my death: "I have not wasted my youth."

I am determined to defend my motherland and dedicate my life to my mother—my motherland and the people. I will continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward on the revolutionary path forever! Become a true warrior of the proletarian revolution.

		May 27, 1964

Chairman Mao said: "We are internationalists, we are also patriots, our slogan is to fight to defend the motherland against the aggressors." I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, resolutely stand at the forefront of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, and be a vanguard of patriotism and internationalism.

		June 15, 1964

Today, I read "Abandon Illusions, Prepare for Struggle" because I saw in the newspaper "Letters from the South," titled "We Will March Forward with the Revolution," written by a girl named "Red" from South Vietnam who had suffered various tortures from the American-Brutus clique. This girl named Little Red, why is she so strong? Why does the American-Brutus clique torture this girl and the innocent people of South Vietnam? It truly makes me feel hatred, hatred towards the common enemy of all the people of the world, and I wish I could eliminate American imperialism in an instant and save the suffering fathers, brothers, and sisters.

I think of the people in the places that have not yet been liberated, and I do not know what kind of suffering they are enduring. In the future, I will definitely abandon any illusions and dedicate my youth to the cause of human liberation. A thousand words cannot express the boiling of my blood!

		August 12, 1964

American imperialists provoke the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, intending to use Vietnam as a springboard to invade China. How can we sit idly by? Chairman Mao calls on us to be internationalists and patriots. I must be ready for battle at all times, ready to respond to the motherland's call, "aid Vietnam, resist America," and fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people to give American imperialism a heavy blow!

		December 2, 1964

Today, I heard the news that our great leader Chairman Mao made a statement: supporting the just struggle of the people of the Congo (Leopoldville). This is such an important matter! I really want to go to the Congo (Leopoldville), support the Congolese brothers, and together with the Congolese brothers eliminate the aggressors and drive American imperialism out of the Congo (Leopoldville). Such feelings are possessed by every soldier. As long as the motherland gives the order, we will march out.

		July 28, 1965

I don't know how many times I have read the article "On the Army's Self-Sufficiency in Production, and the Importance of the Two Great Movements of Rectification and Production." Every time I produce, I read it. Today, I read it a few more times, and it made me understand even more why we need to be self-sufficient in production, why we did it in the past, and why we still do it now. I feel that every soldier comes from the people and should not forget the past hardships. Our motherland is not yet so rich and strong; it needs us to work hard, not only to improve our lives but also to reduce the burden on the people and save more money for the state. I will definitely do well in production and also help other comrades understand the importance of self-sufficiency in production and strive to complete all the tasks given by the motherland.

		August 9, 1965

Sometimes I also think of my family. My family wrote about returning home, but after the help of the leaders and comrades, I gave up this idea. American imperialists are crazily bombing the beautiful mountains and rivers of Vietnam. How many fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters are lying in pools of blood? There are still two-thirds of the people in the world who have not been liberated. How can I go home? I cannot go home! Carry the revolution to the end and be ready to aid Vietnam and resist America with actual actions!

We young people should always remember that the needs of the motherland are our ideals and wishes. As long as the Party says it is needed, we will bravely rush to the front line. The collective is our mother, and we are the children of the collective. Without the collective, there is no us. We will dedicate our blood to the collective and let the insignificant individual shine with light and heat in the great collective.

		November 9, 1965

On the evening of the 6th, I watched a film with deep educational significance, "The Young Generation." With boundless excitement, I finished watching this film. I am proud to have Xiao Yijie and Lin Lan, who follow the Party's words and combine their destiny with the destiny of the people of the motherland, and the Party's needs are their wishes and ideals (of the youth). I like Xiao Yijie and Lin Lan very much. He gave me a good political lesson.

We are the young generation, the successors of the revolution. Although we have not personally experienced the 25,000-li Long March, climbing snow-capped mountains, crossing grasslands, eating belts, and drinking snow water, the fine tradition of fearing no hardships and being willing to live a hard life has taken root and sprouted in our new generation. This is a family treasure that will forever arouse our vigorous revolutionary will. We must take it over and pass it down. We are all new people nurtured by the Party and Chairman Mao. We are all successors of the revolutionary cause. We all have the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress. With such a spirit, the poor and backward mountains will definitely be moved away quickly, and the prosperous and flourishing socialist motherland will definitely stand forever in the East.

		December 6, 1965

Today, I read an article: "Devoted to the Revolution," about a class leader of the Engineering Corps of the Jinan Military Region who sacrificed himself for the lives of twelve comrades. Wang Jie's sacrifice is heavier than Mount Tai. From his diary, I received greater education. To do the revolution well, one must learn from Comrade Wang Jie:

1. Guide one's actions with revolutionary theory;
2. Learn from revolutionary heroes as examples;
3. Treat work with a revolutionary spirit;
4. Treat comrades with a revolutionary attitude;
5. Handle personal issues with revolutionary principles.

I must demand these five points of myself. Doing the revolution is not a matter of one or two days but a lifelong endeavor. Revolution is happiness, and personal happiness is included within it. I will definitely learn from Wang Jie and Lei Feng, study Chairman Mao's works thoroughly, improve my thoughts, take up the guns of Lei Feng and Wang Jie, carry the revolution to the end, continue their diaries, and fight for the cause of communism for life.

　　为全中国人民和全世界人民服务
    一九六四年一月一日
    我是一个青年，又是一个人民战士。我想起了没有解放的地方一切受压迫的人们。只看到自己的青春美好，不看到别人的青春和幸福，那就应该给自己敲一下警钟。
    当党需要我的时候，我愿献出我的一切，请党相信我，考验我的诺言吧！
    最美好的愿望，就是把自己的理想、愿望和祖国的命运紧连在一起，和人民的幸福相结合。这样，一个人就能不断地前进！
    努力把自己锻炼成为共产主义战士，为实现共产主义事业而奋斗！
              一九六四年五月×日
    毛主席说过，应当学习革命前辈那种为革命不惜抛头颅洒鲜血的革命精神。
    为革命贡献自己一切的人，才算是一个真正的人。我能否成为这样的人，还有待于实践。我确实深深体会到，“实践是检验真理的试金石”，我将受实践的考验。
    看吧！我今后一定努力为革命事业多做一些有意义的事情，我将在革命斗争中贡献自己的一生。只有这样在自己临死的时候才不愧说：“我没有白白度过自己的青春。”
    我有决心好好的保卫祖国，将我的一生，献给我的母亲——祖国和人民。我将继续高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，踏着革命的道路永远前进！做一个真正的无产阶级革命战士。
              一九六四年五月二十七日
    毛主席说：“我们是国际主义者，我们又是爱国主义者，我们的口号是为保卫祖国反对侵略者而战。”我一定按毛主席的指示执行，坚决站在反帝、反修斗争的最前线，作一个爱国主义和国际主义的先锋。
              一九六四年六月十五日
    今天我为什么看《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》，因为从报上看到了《南方来信》，标题为《我们一定跟着革命前进》，是一个越南南方受过美吴集团种种肉刑后的姑娘“红”写给她亲爱的心姐的。这个叫小红的姑娘，为什么这样坚强，美吴集团又为什么这样残害这个姑娘，残害无辜的越南南方同胞？真使我心情痛恨，痛恨全世界人民的公敌，恨不得一下子把美帝国主义消灭掉，把受苦的父老兄弟姐妹救出来。
    我联想到没有解放的地方人民，不知道受到什么样的残害。我今后一定丢掉自己的任何幻想，把青春投入到为人类的解放事业当中。千言万语也难写完我的热血的沸腾！
              一九六四年八月十二日
    美帝国主义者对越南民主共和国进行挑衅，想把越南作为侵略中国的跳板，我们怎能坐视不管呢？毛主席号召我们作国际主义者、爱国主义者，我要时刻做好战斗准备，随时听从祖国的召唤，“援越抗美”，和越南人民并肩战斗，给美帝国主义狠狠的回击！
              一九六四年十二月二日
    今天听到了一个消息，那就是我们伟大的领袖毛主席提出了声明：支持刚果（利）人民的正义斗争，这是多么重要的事呀！我真想到刚果（利）去，支援刚果（利）兄弟，和刚果（利）兄弟一起消灭侵略者，把美帝国主义赶出刚果（利）。这样的心情是每个战士所具备的，只要祖国一声号令，我们就出征。
              一九六五年七月二十八日
    《论军队生产自给，兼论整风和生产两大运动的重要性》这篇文章我不知看过多少遍，每次生产都看。今天我又看了几遍，更使我明白了我们为什么要生产自给，过去这样作，现在为什么还这样作。我感到我们每一个军人都是来自人民，不要忘记过去的苦处。我们的祖国并没有那么太富强，正需要我们去作，不但改善我们的生活，也减轻人民的负担，给国家节约更多的资金。我一定在生产上自己好，也要帮助其他同志认识到生产自给的重要性，努力去完成祖国所交给的一切任务。
                一九六五年八月九日
    有时也想到家，家里来信谈到回家的事，但经过领导和同志们的帮助，我打消了这个想法。美帝国主义疯狂地轰炸越南壮丽的山河，多少个爸爸、妈妈、兄弟、姐妹，无辜的倒在血泊里，世界上还有三分之二的人民没有解放，我怎么能回家呢？我不能回家！将革命进行到底，以实际行动，时刻准备援越抗美！
    我们青年人应该永远地记住，祖国的需要就是我们的理想和志愿。只要党说声需要，就勇敢地奔向最前线。集体是我们的母亲，我们是集体的儿女，没有集体，也没有我们。我们要把鲜血贡献给集体，让微不足道的个人在伟大的集体里放射出光和热。
                                （给亲友的信）
              一九六五年十一月九日
    在六号的晚上，我看了一部教育意义极深的影片《年青的一代》。我怀着无限激动的心情，看完了这部影片。我为有萧继业、林岚这样听党的话，把自己的命运和祖国人民的命运紧相结合在一起，党的需要就是自己志愿和理想（的青年）而感到骄傲。我非常喜爱萧继业、林岚这两个人物，他给我上了一堂很好的政治课。
    我们是年轻的一代，是革命的后代。我们虽不曾亲身经历过二万五千里长征，爬雪山，过草地，吃皮带，喝雪水的艰苦生活，但这种不怕任何困难，乐于过艰苦生活的优良传统，却在我们新的一代中生根、发芽，这是永远激起我们旺盛革命意志的传家宝。我们必须要接过来，传下去。我们都是党和毛主席哺育起来的一代新人。我们都是革命事业的接班人。我们都有奋发图强、自力更生的革命斗志。我们有这样的斗志，“一穷二白”的大山是一定能尽快地搬掉的，繁荣昌盛的社会主义祖国一定永远站立在世界的东方。
                                （给老师的信）
              一九六五年十二月六日
    今天，我看了这样一篇文章：《一心为革命》，是济南部队装甲兵某部工兵一连班长，为了十二个同志生命而牺牲。王杰的牺牲，比泰山还重。从他的日记中，我得到了更大的教育，要想干好革命，必须向王杰同志学习：
    一、以革命的理论指导自己的行动；
    二、以革命英雄作自己的学习榜样；
    三、以革命的精神对待工作；
    四、以革命的态度对待同志；
    五、以革命的原则处理个人问题。
    我必须以这五点来要求自己。干革命不是一天两天之事，而是永久的事。革命才是幸福，个人的幸福也包含在内。我一定向王杰、雷锋学习，……大学毛主席著作，把自己的思想改造得更好；接过雷锋和王杰的枪，把革命进行到底；接过他们的日记，把他们没写完的日记写下去，为共产主义事业奋斗终身。
                                      （新华社）
