The South Vietnamese puppet regime of Nguyen Cao Ky, with strong backing from its American masters, recently defeated its political rivals, the Nguyen Van Thieu faction. On the 9th, it announced the sentencing of Nguyen Van Thieu and others to short-term imprisonment.

According to reports from Western news agencies, a so-called Special Discipline Committee set up by the Nguyen Cao Ky faction secretly tried some of its political opponents in Saigon on the 9th. Subsequently, it announced that Nguyen Van Thieu, who had previously served as the commander of the fake First Army, along with Nguyen Van Thuan, Nguyen Van Tho, and Nguyen Van Cao, as well as the commander of the fake First Division, Pham Van Dung, were sentenced to 60 days in prison. It was decided that they would be forced to retire after serving their sentences. Nguyen Van Thieu and the others were recently arrested by the Nguyen Cao Ky faction.
