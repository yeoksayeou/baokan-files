We rural cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants fully support the decision by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to reform the college entrance examination system. This decision boosts the morale of the proletariat and suppresses the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. It is another great joy for us poor and lower-middle peasants, another great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and another triumph for the great thought of Mao Zedong.

We poor and lower-middle peasants must denounce the old bourgeois educational system, including the examination system. It is a system of heinous crimes. This old system is one where bourgeois politics and scores are paramount. For a long time, a small clique of anti-Party, anti-socialist bourgeois representatives in the educational field have stubbornly adhered to their reactionary bourgeois stance, resisted the Party and Chairman Mao's educational policies, and used the old examination system to engage in a head-on struggle with the proletariat. They have ruled over the children of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, excluding a large number of excellent workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary soldiers, and children of revolutionary martyrs from the gates of schools, and opened wide the doors for the bourgeoisie to cultivate their successors.

The facts of discrimination and exclusion suffered by the children of poor and lower-middle peasants in Dapu Town, Hengdong County are but one piece of evidence of this reactionary bourgeois educational system. In the seventeen years since liberation, ten people from our town have been admitted to universities. All ten of these university students are children of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and not a single one is a child of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, or revolutionary cadres. Is it that the children of workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres are inherently "stupid," while the children of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are inherently "intelligent"? No, absolutely not. The fundamental issue is that those anti-Party, anti-socialist bourgeois representatives are playing tricks on us and ruling over us. For example, Lei Huaying, the daughter of the dockworker Lei Huansheng in our town, and Zhu Fengying, the daughter of a landlord, were in the same class at Hengdong No. 1 Middle School. Lei Huaying, whether at school or at home, always listened to the Party and Chairman Mao, loved to read Chairman Mao's books, and had good moral character. She joined the Communist Party of China honorably while in high school. Her academic performance and physical health were both excellent, but she was not admitted to a university after graduating from high school in 1964. On the contrary, Zhu Fengying, who came from a landlord family, had poor moral character, weak labor attitudes, and academic performance worse than Lei Huaying's, but she was admitted to a university. An excellent worker's daughter was excluded from the school gates, while a landlord's daughter with poor performance entered the university. Look, isn't this clear evidence that those bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the educational field are playing tricks on us and ruling over us?

A big landlord in our town has eight children, six of whom are university students, one is a high school student, and one is a junior high school student. Now they have all infiltrated into important organs and universities in Beijing, Wuhan, and other places. The money they send back to this landlord and his wife every month alone amounts to more than 150 yuan, fattening the landlord like a pig, who does not work at all and does not accept reform. We poor and lower-middle peasants are all extremely indignant about this! Isn't this ironclad evidence of the heinous anti-Party, anti-socialist crimes committed by those bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the educational field?

These heinous anti-Party, anti-socialist bourgeois representatives in the educational field have them both above and below. They are connected, eating the food of the working people, wearing the clothes of the working people, and under the banner of "serving the people," they are engaged in anti-people, counter-revolutionary activities. They elevate those filial sons and daughters of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to the heavens, caring for them meticulously and attentively. They regard us workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and children of revolutionary cadres as "thorns in the eye," excluding and striking them, and finding fault in every way. My family was very poor in the past, and for generations, we were all illiterate. In 1958, I sent my daughter Qiu'e to Dapu Primary School with great confidence, determined to achieve a complete cultural liberation. Because our family had many people and few laborers, she would sometimes be late returning from school to participate in labor, or take a few days off during busy farming seasons. The school principal and teachers used this as an excuse to label her as "lazy and having poor grades," demanding that she drop out and not continue her studies. At that time, I was very angry, thinking: The evil Kuomintang reactionaries made me illiterate, and I suffered half my life without culture. Today, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants have the opportunity to study, but now we are still being restricted and cannot go to school. Are we going to become illiterate again? The more I thought about it, the more painful and angry I became. I ran to the school to negotiate with the principal and teachers, and they reluctantly allowed my daughter to complete one semester of school. In 1964, I sent my second daughter Qiuying to school. Because of the severe drought in 1963, I could not pay the tuition on time, and the school did not issue books for four months. My daughter could only listen to classes and copy from other people's books. For this matter, I went to the school myself to find the teacher, but the result was just one sentence: "No books, no school!" This dragged on for four months. Later, the town Party committee discovered this situation and resolved it. But by the time the books were issued, the entire semester had already passed by two-thirds. In this way, how could the academic performance of our poor and lower-middle peasant students be good? The neighborhood leader Xu Qinglian (whose husband is a worker) was a deeply resentful person in the old society. Her son Deng Donglin usually performed well and had good grades, but last summer when he took the high school entrance exam, the school used the excuse of "poor grades" and did not admit him. Another child from a bad family background and poor character, because his parents treated the teacher to a meal, was admitted. Later, Xu Qinglian's husband wrote a letter to the school expressing his opinion, and the principal, after seeing the letter, threw it on the table and threatened, "He goes to complain, I'm not afraid no matter where he goes!" Obviously, this educational system is not about opening the doors to workers, peasants, and soldiers, but about ruling over them. It is not about serving the politics of the proletariat, but about serving the politics of the bourgeoisie.

The bourgeois representatives in the educational field are so deeply hostile to the cultural liberation of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres. The fundamental reason is that they want to monopolize the leadership of the educational field and the school campuses for a long time, and want to turn schools into schools of revisionism and capitalism, cultivate successors for the bourgeoisie, and make spiritual and "talent" preparations for their counter-revolutionary restoration. Therefore, the reform of the educational system is a serious class struggle concerning the defense of Mao Zedong Thought, the defense of the proletarian helm, and the defense of the socialist homeland. Now, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have made the wise decision to reform the educational system, speaking the words in our poor and lower-middle peasants' hearts. We poor and lower-middle peasants must resolutely stand at the forefront of this struggle, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, striving to completely eradicate the heinous bourgeois educational system and establish a new educational system of the proletariat. In implementing the recruitment method of combining recommendations and selections, we rural cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants pledge to the Party: We will definitely abolish the bourgeois recruitment method, act as good "examiners" for college admissions, and seriously and conscientiously assist the Party and the government in doing a good job of recommending and selecting new students.

We, the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, must resolutely do the following: We will not enter schools that are not of the proletariat, we will not read books that are not compiled by the proletariat, and we will not listen to words that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. We must follow the direction indicated by the Party to the end. We must cultivate and temper our own children of poor and lower-middle peasants into strong proletarian revolutionary successors, pass on the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation, and defend our socialist motherland so that it will never change color for ten thousand years!

　　10∶0说明了什么？
　　湖南省贫下中农代表大会代表
　　学习毛主席著作积极分子　　　邓云柏
    我们农村干部和贫下中农，对党中央、国务院决定改革高等学校招生考试办法，一千个、一万个拥护。这个决定，长了无产阶级的志气，灭了资产阶级的威风。这是我们贫下中农的又一件大喜事，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一个大胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的又一个新胜利。
    我们贫下中农要控诉旧的资产阶级教育制度，包括招生考试制度。它是一种罪恶滔天的制度。这个旧的制度，实行的是资产阶级政治挂帅，分数挂帅。长期以来，钻在教育界的一小撮反党反社会主义资产阶级代表人物，顽固地坚持资产阶级的反动立场，抗拒党和毛主席的教育方针，利用旧的招生考试制度，来同无产阶级进行针锋相对的斗争。他们对工人、贫下中农子女实行专政，把大量的优秀的工人、贫下中农、革命干部、革命军人和革命烈士的子女，排斥在学校的大门之外，为资产阶级造就他们的接班人大开方便之门。
    我们衡东县大浦镇贫下中农子弟，遭到歧视和排斥的事实，就是这种反动的资产阶级教育制度的罪证之一。解放十七年来，我们镇里有十个人考取了大学。这十个大学生，全部是地、富、反、坏、右的子女，没有一个是我们工人、贫下中农和革命干部的子弟。难道是我们工人、农民和革命干部的子女生成就“愚蠢”，地、富、反、坏、右的子女生成就“聪明”吗？不是，完全不是。根本问题是那些反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物在搞我们的鬼，专我们的政。例如，我们镇上码头工人雷皇声的女儿雷华英，和地主的女儿朱凤英，在衡东一中读高中时，同一个班。雷华英不论在学校，在家里，都最听党和毛主席的话，最爱读毛主席的书，思想品德很好。在读高中时就光荣地加入了中国共产党。她的学习成绩和身体都很好，可是她在一九六四年高中毕业后，考大学没有被录取。相反，出身地主家庭的朱凤英，思想品德不好，劳动观点不强，学习成绩也比雷华英差，却考上了大学。优秀的工人女儿被排除在校门外，表现不好的地主女儿却进了大学。请看，这不明明是那些钻进教育界的资产阶级代表人物在搞我们的鬼，专我们的政又是什么？
    我们镇上的一个大地主，他的八个子女就有六个是大学生，一个是高中生，一个是初中生。现在他们都钻进了北京、武汉等地，在重要机关和大学里工作，他们每月光给这个地主和地主婆寄回的钱，就达一百五十元之多，把地主喂得象肥猪一样，根本不劳动，根本不接受改造。对此，我们贫下中农无不万分气愤！钻在教育界的资产阶级代表人物，这难道不是你们进行反党反社会主义的滔天罪行的铁证吗？
    这些万恶滔天的反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物，在教育界，上面有，下面也有。他们一脉相通，吃劳动人民的饭，穿劳动人民的衣，打着“为人民服务”的招牌，干的是反人民反革命的勾当。他们把那些地、富、反、坏、右的孝子贤孙捧上了天，关怀备至，体贴入微。他们把我们工人、贫下中农、革命干部的子女看成“眼中钉”，排斥打击，百般非难。我家里过去很穷，祖祖辈辈都是光眼瞎子。一九五八年，我信心百倍地送女儿秋娥去大浦小学读书，决心争取在文化上彻底翻身。因为家里人多劳力少，她放学回家要参加劳动，有时迟到一点，农忙时请点假，学校的校长、老师就以此为借口，给她加上“吊儿郎当、成绩不好”的罪名，要她退学，不让再读下去。我当时很气愤，心想：万恶的国民党反动派害得我一字不识，吃了半辈子没文化的苦。今天在党和毛主席的领导下，我们贫下中农有了读书的机会，现在还要受卡，不能上学。难道还要让我们再变光眼瞎子吗？我越想越痛心，越想越气不过，跑到学校找校长、老师交涉，他们才勉强让我女儿读完一学期书。一九六四年我送第二个女儿秋英上学，因为一九六三年遭受了大旱灾，我一时交不齐学费，学校就四个月没发给书，我女儿只得听听课，借人家的书本抄一抄。为这事我自己赶到学校找老师，结果是一句话：“不行，冒（没）书就莫读了！”这样一拖再拖，一直拖了四个月。后来镇党委发现了这个情况，才给解决。但到发书时，全学期已过去了三分之二。这样，我们贫下中农学生的成绩哪里好得起来？居民组长许清连（爱人是工人）在旧社会是一个苦大仇深的人，她的儿子邓冬林平时表现不错，成绩也不错，去年夏天考高小时，学校借口“成绩不好”，没有录取。而另一个家庭成份不好、品质也很差的孩子，因家长请老师吃了饭，结果被录取了。后来，许清连的爱人写信给学校提意见，校长看了信，就把信往桌子上一放，威胁说：“他去告状，告到哪里去我都不怕！”很显然，这种教育制度不是向工农兵开门，而是向工农兵专政，不是为无产阶级的政治服务，而是为资产阶级的政治服务。
    教育界的资产阶级代表人物，对我们工人、贫下中农、革命干部的文化翻身，所以这样深恶痛绝，根本原因就是他们妄想长期霸占教育界的领导权，霸占学校的阵地，妄想把学校办成修正主义、资本主义的学校，培养资产阶级接班人，为他们搞反革命复辟作精神准备和
  “人材”准备。因此，教育制度的改革是一场关系到保卫毛泽东思想，保卫无产阶级印把子，保卫社会主义江山的严肃的阶级斗争。现在，党中央和毛主席作出了改革教育制度的英明决定，说出了我们贫下中农的心里话，我们贫下中农要坚决地站在这场斗争的最前列，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把这场文化大革命进行到底，为彻底铲除罪恶滔天的资产阶级教育制度，建立起无产阶级自己的新的教育制度而奋斗。在实行推荐和选拔相结合的招生办法中，我们农村干部和贫下中农向党保证：一定破除资产阶级的招生办法，当好高等学校招生的“监考官”，严肃认真地协助党和政府做好新生的推荐和选拔工作。
    我们贫农、下中农的子女坚决做到：不是无产阶级的学校不进，不是无产阶级自己编的书不读，不符合毛泽东思想的话不听。一定要朝着党所指引的方向走到底。一定要将我们贫下中农自己的儿女，培养锻炼成坚强的无产阶级革命接班人，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗接过来，一代一代地传下去，保卫我们的社会主义祖国千年万代永远不变颜色！
