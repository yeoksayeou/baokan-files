The great Communist fighter Liu Yingjun is a model in studying the works of Chairman Mao—our highest directive for all work—and is also a model in using the highest directive to transform his worldview.

Chairman Mao has said: “The transformation of one’s worldview is a fundamental transformation.”

What should we use to transform our worldview? Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Liu Yingjun has said, “Studying the works of Chairman Mao is not for the sake of formality, nor is it to memorize some chapters and phrases to show off. It is to make revolution and build the country, to transform one’s thinking and transform nature.” Comrade Liu Yingjun studies the works of Chairman Mao by focusing on the “use” of them. Where should they be used? First and foremost, they should be used to transform one’s worldview.

How do we use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our worldview? Liu Yingjun often asks himself four questions: “First, what does Chairman Mao say? Second, what do I think? Third, what do I do? Fourth, what should I do in the future?”

“What does Chairman Mao say?” This means “reading Chairman Mao’s books and listening to Chairman Mao’s words,” striving to learn and master Mao Zedong Thought.

“What do I think? What do I do?” This means using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to examine and check one’s thoughts and actions. Are my thoughts in line with what Chairman Mao says? Do my actions conform to what Chairman Mao says?

Liu Yingjun studies the works of Chairman Mao and constantly reflects on and examines himself. One cold night, he studied “In Memory of Norman Bethune” again. He thought: “I have known about the broken window in the stable for a long time. Why didn’t I think of fixing it before?” He found the problem in his own actions from Chairman Mao’s works: “I still lack the spirit of extreme responsibility for the revolution like Comrade Norman Bethune.”

The works of Chairman Mao are the highest directives for all our work, and they are also the highest directives for transforming our worldview. “What should I do in the future?” This means firmly executing the highest directives, “acting according to Chairman Mao’s directives.”

Believing in the highest directives and executing them without deviation, making one’s thoughts and actions completely in line with the highest directives—this is the most precious spirit of Comrade Liu Yingjun.

It is precisely because Liu Yingjun has this spirit that he can establish a proletarian worldview, growing from an ordinary youth into a great Communist fighter.

If one’s worldview is not transformed, even if one is temporarily swept into the revolutionary tide, one will eventually be washed out by the surging revolutionary tide.

Learn from the good fighter of Chairman Mao, Comrade Liu Yingjun: Study the highest directives like he does, and use the highest directives to transform our worldview!

    象他那样改造世界观
    戈松
    伟大的共产主义战士刘英俊，是学习毛主席著作——我们一切工作最高指示的模范，也是用最高指示来改造自己世界观的模范。
    毛主席说过：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。
    用什么来改造我们的世界观？用毛泽东思想。
    刘英俊同志说，学习毛主席著作，“不是为了走形式，更不是为了记一些章节词句，显示自己，而是为了闹革命、搞建设，是为了改造思想和改造大自然。”刘英俊同志学习毛主席著作，是在“用”字上狠下功夫的。“用”在什么地方？首先是“用”在改造自己的世界观上。
    怎样用毛泽东思想改造我们的世界观？刘英俊经常用四个问题来反问自己：“一、毛主席是怎样讲的？二、我是怎样想的？三、我是怎样做的？四、今后应当怎样去做？”
    “毛主席是怎样讲的？”这就是“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话”，努力学习和掌握毛泽东思想。
    “我是怎样想的？我是怎样做的？”这就是以毛泽东思想为武器，对照、检查自己的所“想”和所“做”。自己所“想”的，是不是跟毛主席所讲的一样？自己所“做”的，符合不符合毛主席所讲的？
    刘英俊学习毛主席著作，时时不忘对照和检查自己。一个寒夜，他又一次学习《纪念白求恩》。他想：马房里的破窗洞自己早就发现了，“为什么过去没有想到去堵”？他从毛主席的著作中找到了自己做得不够的地方：“还缺乏象白求恩同志那样对革命极端负责的精神。”
    毛主席的著作，是我们一切工作的最高指示，也是我们改造自己世界观的最高指示。“今后应当怎样去做”？就是坚决执行最高指示，“照毛主席的指示办事”。
    坚信最高指示，不折不扣地执行最高指示，使自己所想所做的完全符合最高指示，这是刘英俊同志最可贵的精神。
    正是因为刘英俊有了这一条，他才能够树立无产阶级的世界观，从一个普通青年成长为一个伟大的共产主义战士。
    一个人的世界观如果不改造好，即使一时被革命浪潮卷了进来，也终究会被奔腾不息的革命浪潮冲出去。
    向毛主席的好战士刘英俊同志学习：象他那样努力学习最高指示，象他那样用最高指示来改造我们的世界观！
