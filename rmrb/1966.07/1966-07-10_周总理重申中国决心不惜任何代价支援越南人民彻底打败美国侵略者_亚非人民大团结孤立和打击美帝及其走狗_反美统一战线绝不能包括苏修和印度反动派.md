Premier Zhou solemnly reaffirmed tonight: The Chinese people and the Chinese government are determined to take any risks and pay any price to support the Vietnamese people until they achieve final victory.

Premier Zhou strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious stage, and for pressuring the Vietnamese people to seek peace. Premier Zhou pointed out that the struggle against U.S. imperialism is a life-and-death struggle. All revolutionary peoples of the world must abandon any illusions, believe in the power of the people, rely on the power of the people, unite as one, and persist in the struggle to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors.

Premier Zhou made these remarks at a banquet tonight celebrating the successful conclusion of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers.

Premier Zhou mentioned that during the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, U.S. imperialism escalated the war of aggression against Vietnam to a new and more serious stage. He said: "The United States is now insisting on fighting to the end in South Vietnam, obviously with the aim of pressuring the Vietnamese people to seek peace, otherwise it will destroy Vietnam. However, the heroic Vietnamese people will never yield to U.S. war threats, and all countries and peoples that truly support the Vietnamese people in their anti-U.S. struggle will also not waver in the face of U.S. war threats. The U.S. aims will never be achieved."

He said: "At this critical moment when U.S. imperialism is expanding its aggression against Vietnam, all countries and peoples that truly support the Vietnamese people in their anti-U.S. struggle must respond to the U.S. challenge with one voice: use all forces, in political, military, economic, and moral aspects, to unreservedly support the Vietnamese people in driving the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam. The Chinese people and the Chinese government have been doing this since the first day of U.S. aggression against Vietnam. We are determined to take any risks and pay any price to support the Vietnamese people until they achieve final victory."

Premier Zhou emphasized: "This is a life-and-death struggle. Either we defeat U.S. imperialism, or we submit to U.S. imperialism. There is no middle ground. All revolutionary peoples of the world must abandon any illusions, believe in the power of the people, rely on the power of the people, unite as one, and persist in the struggle to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors."

Premier Zhou said: "It is precisely at this critical moment that the Indian government proposed to reconvene the Geneva Conference. This proposal is completely aimed at confusing the vision of the peoples of the world and dispersing the fighting spirit of the Vietnamese people. It is clear that this is serving the United States.

"China is a participant of the 1954 Geneva Conference. It must be pointed out that the Geneva Agreement has long been completely torn up by the United States. To talk about the Geneva Agreement, the United States must unconditionally, immediately, completely, and cleanly withdraw all its armed forces from Vietnam. If the U.S. troops do not withdraw, there is no question of reconvening the Geneva Conference.

"Again, it is precisely at this critical moment that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique shamelessly declared: U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong does not affect U.S.-Soviet cooperation and the conclusion of disarmament agreements, while the United States is expanding military operations in Vietnam. This is the most open and blatant betrayal of the Vietnamese people."

Premier Zhou said: "Everyone can see that in the face of U.S. imperialism's expansion of aggression against Vietnam, the Indian reactionaries and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique are playing such a shameful role. To the greatest extent possible, to isolate and strike at U.S. imperialism, the peoples of Asia and Africa and the peoples of the world must continuously expand and strengthen the united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. This united front should be based on the great unity of all revolutionary peoples of the world, including all countries and peoples suffering from U.S. imperialism's aggression, interference, control, and bullying, but it must not include the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and the Indian reactionaries. On the contrary, they can only be the targets of the struggle of the international anti-U.S. united front."

    周总理重申中国决心不惜任何代价支援越南人民彻底打败美国侵略者
    亚非人民大团结孤立和打击美帝及其走狗  反美统一战线绝不能包括苏修和印度反动派
    新华社九日讯　周恩来总理今晚庄严地重申：中国人民和中国政府决心不怕冒任何风险，不惜付出任何代价，支援兄弟的越南人民，直到取得最后胜利。
    周恩来总理强烈谴责美帝国主义把侵略越南的战争上升到一个新的更加严重的阶段，压迫越南人民求和。周总理指出，同美帝国主义的斗争是一场你死我活的斗争。全世界一切革命的人民，必须丢掉任何幻想，相信人民的力量，依靠人民的力量，团结一致，坚持斗争，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    周恩来总理是在今晚庆祝亚非作家紧急会议胜利闭幕的宴会上讲这些话的。
    周恩来总理讲到，在亚非作家紧急会议进行期间，美帝国主义把侵略越南的战争上升到一个新的更加严重的阶段。他说：“美国现在口口声声要在越南南方打到底，其目的显然是，要压迫越南人民求和，否则就要摧毁越南。但是，英雄的越南人民决不会在美国的战争讹诈面前屈服，一切真正支持越南人民进行抗美战争的国家和人民，也决不会在美国的战争讹诈面前动摇。美国的目的，永远不会得逞。”
    他说：“在美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的关键时刻，一切真正支持越南人民进行抗美战争的国家和人民，对美帝国主义的挑战只能有一个回答，那就是，用一切力量，在政治、军事、经济、道义各个方面，无保留地支持越南人民把美国强盗从越南赶出去。中国人民和中国政府从美国侵略越南的第一天起，就是这样做的。我们决心不怕冒任何风险，不惜付出任何代价，支援兄弟的越南人民，直到取得最后胜利。”
    周总理强调说：“这是一场你死我活的斗争。要末就是战胜美帝国主义，要末就是屈伏于美帝国主义。中间的道路是没有的。全世界一切革命的人民，必须丢掉任何幻想，相信人民的力量，依靠人民的力量，团结一致，坚持斗争，彻底打败美国侵略者。”
    周总理说：“正是在这关键的时刻，印度政府提出了重新召开日内瓦会议的建议。这个建议，完全是为了模糊世界人民的视线，涣散越南人民的斗志。一看就知道，这是为美国效劳。
      “中国是一九五四年日内瓦会议的参加国。必须指出，日内瓦协议早就被美国彻底撕光了。要谈日内瓦协议，美国就必须无条件地立即、全部、彻底、干净地从越南撤走它的武装力量。美国兵不撤走，就根本谈不上重新召开日内瓦会议。
      “又正是在这关键的时刻，苏联修正主义领导集团竟然丧心病狂地宣称：美国轰炸河内、海防，并不影响美苏合作、达成裁军协议，而美国在越南正是扩军扩战。这是对越南人民最公开露骨的出卖。”
    周总理说：“大家可以看到，在美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争中，印度反动派和苏联修正主义领导集团扮演的是怎样一种可耻的角色。为了最大限度地孤立和打击美帝国主义，亚非人民和全世界人民有必要从各方面不断扩大和加强反对美帝国主义及其走狗的统一战线。这个统一战线，应当以全世界革命人民的大团结为基础，包括一切受到美帝国主义侵略、干涉、控制和欺负的国家和人民，但是绝不能包括苏联修正主义领导集团和印度反动派。相反，他们只能是国际反美统一战线斗争的对象。”
