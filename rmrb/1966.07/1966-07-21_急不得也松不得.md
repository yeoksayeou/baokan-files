Title: Neither Rush Nor Relax

	Studying and applying Chairman Mao's works requires a focus on the "use" aspect. The masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works have a distinct feature: they learn a bit, use a bit, learn and then use, with immediate results. Their speeches at discussion meetings and articles on wall newspapers are concise, lively, and use Mao Zedong Thought to deeply explain and solve practical problems, without any trace of empty rhetoric.

	We recommend this style of short articles that discuss one issue at a time to our readers and hope that workers, peasants, and soldiers will write more of such articles. — Editor

	Neither Rush Nor Relax

	Zhang Mingyi, Squad Leader of a Cannon Squad in a Unit of the Nanjing Military Region

	There is a new soldier in our squad who is somewhat afraid of hard work and fatigue. Comrades have helped him many times, but there has been no significant improvement. I was very anxious. After studying "On Contradiction," I realized that the transformation of contradictions has a process; the transformation of backward soldiers also has a process. Expecting someone to "eat a big meal in one bite" is unrealistic. Understanding this truth, I became less impatient. However, I developed another bias: waiting for him to improve without actively shortening his process of improvement. For example, when cleaning the cannon, he was afraid of getting his clothes dirty, holding up his right sleeve with his left hand and using three fingers to wipe with a cloth. I wanted to talk to him, but then I thought he was already cleaning, which was an improvement from before, so I swallowed my words. When shoveling manure, he wore a large mask, gripping the handle of the shovel with both hands, leaning to one side, and taking a long time to shovel a single load. Seeing this, after work, I wanted to talk to him, but thinking of the word "process," I hesitated again.

	But who would have thought that my approach to the "process" would not work for him? Instead, he was moving further away. His fear of dirt and hard work became more severe, and eventually, he even refused to be a cannon loader, requesting to change to a lighter job. This really shocked me. Why is it that not acknowledging the process is not good, and acknowledging the process is also not good? With this question in mind, I studied "On Contradiction" again and realized that the development and change of things all have a process, but this process is not rigid and unchangeable. Acknowledging the process is not the goal; acknowledging the process is to shorten the process, do a good job of transforming contradictions, and promote the development of things. If one thinks that there will inevitably be a process and relaxes the work of heating up, then the process will be prolonged, even turning in the opposite direction. Conversely, acknowledging the process and actively working, providing appropriate heat, can promote the transformation of things. Previously, from the extreme of not acknowledging the process, I fell into the opposite extreme of passively acknowledging the process. On this issue, I overcame one-sidedness and then fell into another one-sidedness.

	After overcoming my one-sided understanding, I corrected my attitude towards the new soldier. I paired up with him for study and mutual help, addressing his immediate thoughts, often studying Chairman Mao's works together, discussing heroic and model stories, reading revolutionary literary works, and doing heating-up work to create conditions for his transformation. His mind became filled with Mao Zedong Thought and heroic images, and he began to realize: revolution cannot be afraid of hardship, being afraid of hardship means not being able to revolutionize, revolutionary forerunners endured the hardships of crossing snow mountains and grasslands, shedding blood and sacrificing their lives, so that we today do not suffer from class oppression and exploitation. The bitterness we endure today is for the early liberation of the three-quarters of the world's laboring people from suffering. Enduring hardship for the revolution brings joy in hardship, and joy in hardship. After his consciousness was raised, his actions also changed greatly. Previously, he did not want to shovel manure, but now he is not afraid of manure splashing on his clothes. Previously, he did not want to be a cannon loader, finding it tiring to carry shells, but now he enthusiastically trains, enduring the fatigue of carrying shells until his waist and back ache.

专栏：

    活学活用毛主席著作，要在“用”字上狠下功夫。广大工农兵学习毛主席著作，有一个鲜明的特点，就是学一点，用一点，学了就用，立竿见影。他们在讲用会上的发言，在墙报上写的文章，短小精悍，生动活泼，运用毛泽东思想深刻地说明和解决一个实际问题，没有一点八股气味。
    我们向读者推荐这种“一事一议”的短文章，也希望工农兵同志多写这种文章。　——编者
    急不得也松不得
    南京部队某部炮班长　张明义
    我们班里有一位新战士，工作有些怕苦怕累。同志们多次帮助，没有明显进步。我心里很着急。学习了《矛盾论》，我认识到矛盾转化要有一个过程；后进战士的转变，也要有一个过程，要求人家“一口吃成一个胖子”，是不切实际的。懂得了这个道理，我就不急躁了。但是又产生了另一种偏向，就是等待他进步，不去努力缩短他进步的过程。比如，擦炮的时候，他怕弄脏了衣裳，左手提着右袖口，用三只指头捏着布擦。我想去对他做思想工作，可一想他已经动手擦了，比以前袖手旁观已前进了一步，话到嘴边又咽了回去。舀粪的时候，他戴着大口罩，两手攥着勺柄梢，趔着个身子，老半天才舀一下子。看到这情景，收工后我想去找他谈谈，但一想到“过程”两字，也就欲言又止了。
    可谁知，我这样对待“过程”，他却“过”不来了。甚至有些越“过”越远了。怕脏怕苦的思想越来越严重，后来竟发展到不愿意当炮手装填炮弹，要求改行干个轻快活儿。这下子对我震动很大。为啥不承认过程不行，承认了过程也不行呢？带着这个问题，我又学习了《矛盾论》，认识到事物发展变化都要有一个过程，但这个过程不是僵死的，不是不可改变的。承认过程并不是目的，承认过程正是为了缩短过程，做好矛盾的转化工作，促进事物的发展。如果认为反正要有一个过程，就放松了加温工作，那么，过程就会越拉越长，甚至向相反的方向转化。反之，承认了过程，努力进行工作，给予适当的温度，就能够促进事物的转化。我以前，从不承认过程的极端，走到消极地承认过程的另一个极端，在这个问题上克服了一个片面性，又犯了另一个片面性。
    我克服了认识上的片面性，就改正了对那位新战士的态度。我跟他结成帮学对子，针对他的活思想，经常和他一起学习毛主席著作，讲英雄模范事迹，读革命的文艺书籍，做加温工作，给他的转变创造条件。他脑子里毛泽东思想多了起来，英雄形象多了起来，开始认识到：革命就不能怕苦，怕苦就不能革命，革命前辈吃了爬雪山，过草地，抛头颅，洒热血的苦，才有我们今天不受阶级压迫、剥削的甜。我们今天吃点苦，正是为了世界上三分之二劳苦人民早日不吃苦。为了革命吃苦，苦中有乐，乐在苦中。他的觉悟提高以后，行动也大大变了样。以前他不愿意掏大粪，现在不怕粪便溅脏衣服了。以前不愿当炮手，嫌扛炮弹累，现在自觉练兵情绪高，扛炮弹累得腰痠背痛也坚持到底。
