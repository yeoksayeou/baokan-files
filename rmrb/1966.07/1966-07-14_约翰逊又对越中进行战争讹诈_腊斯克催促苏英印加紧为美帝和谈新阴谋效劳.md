According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 13th, Washington: On the 12th, U.S. President Johnson, while discussing the U.S. invasion of Vietnam, once again made blatant war threats against the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples. He did not hide the ambition of the U.S. invaders to escalate the war in Vietnam, shouting that the U.S. must "continue to fight on" in Vietnam.

Johnson said in a speech to the American alumni association, "We are fighting a war of wills. This war may last a long time. But we must continue to fight on," until the other side "agrees to (American terms) a peaceful settlement."

Johnson also shouted that "the U.S. as a Pacific power must fulfill our obligations in Asia," and that the argument for the U.S. to withdraw from Asia, especially from South Vietnam, "is not valid." He said that Asia is an "important stage," and the U.S. must "hold on to" South Vietnam to form a "new Asia." This means that the U.S. wants to long-term occupy South Vietnam as a base for its aggression and expansion in Southeast Asia.

Johnson's words were fierce, but in reality, he was very weak. In his speech, he revealed that the increasingly disastrous war in Vietnam has become the top problem for the U.S. ruling class. He admitted, "In a world undergoing revolutionary changes, there is no more difficult task." He wants the American people to pay more money and sacrifice more lives for the war of the U.S. monopolies in Vietnam, and to "shoulder the burden—perhaps for a long time—of a disturbing, costly war." On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk also admitted in a press conference on the Vietnam war that he could not explain how much effort and sacrifice the Vietnam war would require of the U.S., and how much it would cost.

Rusk urged the Soviet revisionist clique to make "some positive and serious efforts" to push for peace on the Vietnam issue, especially to take joint action with the British and Indian reactionaries to serve the U.S. "bombing for peace" plot. He said that British Prime Minister Wilson and Indian Prime Minister Gandhi would discuss this issue with the Soviet government in Moscow. As the two co-chairs of the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union and Britain "have many opportunities to do something, take some steps, and seize the opportunity to start working on this issue." The U.S. "hopes that the two co-chairs will find a way to do this."

　　约翰逊又对越中进行战争讹诈
　　腊斯克催促苏英印加紧为美帝和谈新阴谋效劳
    据新华社十三日讯华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊十二日在谈到美国侵越战争时，再次对越南人民和中国人民进行露骨的战争讹诈。他毫不掩饰美国侵略者扩大侵越战争的野心，叫嚷美国必须在越南“继续打下去”。
    约翰逊在美国同学会发表演说时说，“我们正在打一场拚决心的战争。这场战争可能打一个长时期。但是我们必须继续打下去”，直到对方“同意（按美国的条件）和平解决”。
    约翰逊还叫嚷“美国作为一个太平洋的大国要履行我们在亚洲的义务”，要美国退出亚洲、特别是退出南越的论据“是不能成立的”。他说，亚洲是一个“重要舞台”，美国要在“保住”南越后来形成一个“新亚洲”。这就是说，美国要长期霸占南越作为它在东南亚进行侵略和扩张的基地。
    约翰逊口头上气势汹汹，骨子里却是虚弱得很。他在演说中表明，越败越惨的侵越战争已经成为美国统治集团的头号难题。他承认，“在一个发生革命性变化的世界上，再没有比这更困难的任务了。”他要美国人民为美国垄断集团侵略越南的战争更多地出钱卖命，要他们“肩负起——也许要肩负一个长时期——进行一场困扰人的、代价浩大的战争的重担”。美国国务卿腊斯克同一天在记者招待会上谈到侵越战争时也承认，他无法说明，侵越战争将要求美国“作出多大的努力”和“作出多大的牺牲”，“要求付出多大的代价”。
    腊斯克要苏联修正主义集团为越南问题“推向和平作出一些积极的、认真的努力”，特别是要它同英国和印度反动派采取联合行动为美国“以炸迫和”的阴谋效劳。他说，英国首相威尔逊和印度总理甘地夫人将在莫斯科同苏联政府讨论这个问题。作为日内瓦会议两主席的苏联和英国“在这方面有许多机会可以作出一些事情，采取一些步骤，抓住机会开始在这个问题上进行工作”。美国“希望两主席会找到这样做的办法”。
