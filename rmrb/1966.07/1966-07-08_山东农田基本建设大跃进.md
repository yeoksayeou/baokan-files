	Shandong Province's extensive cadres and commune members have taken up the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously promoting agricultural land construction centered on drought resistance and also addressing flood control and waterlogging. This has led to a new leap forward in agricultural land construction. Since last winter and this spring, the entire province has dug a large number of brick wells and machine wells, built a number of small reservoirs and dams, and expanded the irrigated area by nearly eight million mu, equivalent to the total increase in irrigated area over the past six years. At the same time, the drainage area has been expanded by more than 580 million mu. These projects have played a significant role in the long-term drought resistance struggle. This year, the entire province has irrigated over 240 million mu of wheat, the largest area ever recorded; of the 600 million mu of spring crops sown, a considerable portion has been irrigated using newly built water conservancy facilities.

	The remarkable achievements in Shandong Province's agricultural land water conservancy construction are fundamentally due to the extensive cadres and masses raising high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizing politics. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee emphasized that the fundamental guarantee for completing this task is to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study Chairman Mao's works extensively, and arm the extensive cadres and masses with Mao Zedong Thought. Thus, cadres and commune members participating in water conservancy construction use the intervals before and after work and rest time on the construction site to study Chairman Mao's "Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle" and the "Three Articles" in connection with problems encountered during construction. The broad masses study and apply what they learn, combining learning with application, significantly raising their consciousness, establishing a long-term drought resistance mindset, and recognizing that drought is the enemy and drought resistance is revolution.

    山东农田基本建设大跃进
    山东省广大干部和社员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力开展以抗旱为中心兼顾防洪除涝的农田基本建设活动，使农田基本建设出现了新的跃进形势。去冬今春以来，全省又新打了大批砖井和机井，修建了一批小水库塘坝，灌溉面积扩大了近八百万亩，等于过去六年新增灌溉面积的总和。同时，扩大排涝面积五百八十多万亩。这些工程在持续时间很长的抗旱斗争中，已经发挥了巨大的作用。今年全省抗旱浇麦两千四百多万亩，是历史上浇麦面积最大的一年；已播的六千万亩春田中，也有相当一部分是靠新建水利设施引水浇灌的。
    山东省农田水利基本建设取得显著成绩的根本原因，是广大干部和群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治的结果。山东省委着重指出，实现这一任务的根本保证是：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大学毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想武装广大干部和群众。这样，参加兴修水利的干部和社员，就利用出工前后的间隙，利用工地休息时间，联系施工中遇到的问题，反复学习毛主席的《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》和“老三篇”等文章。广大群众边学边用、学了就用、学用结合，大大提高了觉悟，树立了长期抗旱思想，认识到干旱就是敌人，抗旱就是革命。
