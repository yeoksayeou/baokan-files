Zhou Yang's Criminal Activities Are Completely Bankrupt
Cultural Bureau of the Museum of Chinese Revolution Yu Jian

At the end of 1958, the Party Central Committee decided to establish the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, with a focus on promoting the great role of Mao Zedong Thought in the history of the Chinese revolution. During the construction of the museum from 1959 to 1961, Zhou Yang seized this opportunity to oppose Mao Zedong Thought in every possible way.

Zhou Yang's schemes to oppose Mao Zedong Thought were numerous and can be summarized into four categories: "erase," "pick up," "cut," and "squeeze."

First is "erase." Erase the great role of Mao Zedong Thought in the history of the Chinese revolution.

In 1959, during the leadership of the exhibition on the history of the Chinese revolution, Zhou Yang adopted an attitude of "erasing in one stroke" towards the great role of Mao Zedong Thought in the history of the Chinese revolution, never mentioning the issue of highlighting the great role of Mao Zedong Thought from beginning to end. Instead, he absurdly proposed: "All those who have played a role in history should not be erased. For example, Chen Duxiu should be represented."

On the eve of the 10th anniversary of National Day, a responsible comrade from the Party Central Committee reviewed the exhibition on the history of the Chinese revolution and pointed out incisively: The exhibition lacks the red line of Mao Zedong Thought. It is precisely because of this fundamental error in the exhibition that it could not be opened as originally planned on October 1st to welcome National Day.

Second is "pick up." Pick up the trash of Khrushchev's opposition to so-called "personality cult" to oppose Mao Zedong Thought.

On October 29, 1959, before the exhibition revision work had even begun, Zhou Yang eagerly gave a report lasting over two hours to all the staff of the museum. He said: "Now we need to highlight the correct line, not the personal image of Chairman Mao, not hanging more portraits of Chairman Mao, but to highlight Chairman Mao's line." Zhou Yang used the pretext of opposing "personality worship" to oppose Mao Zedong Thought. Isn't this the same tune as Khrushchev using the pretext of opposing "personality cult" to oppose Stalin, oppose Marxism-Leninism, and oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat?

Third is "cut." Cut the red line of Mao Zedong Thought with a big knife.

In 1961, after the exhibition was revised to highlight the red line of Mao Zedong Thought, Zhou Yang repeatedly complained: "There are too many red lines," "The red line is too thick," "There are too many things of Chairman Mao, it's not valuable anymore, everywhere is Chairman Mao, it's like Chairman Mao is writing labels for the museum."

On April 30, 1961, Zhou Yang said again: "Emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, the direction of emphasizing the present and belittling the past is correct, but the commander cannot be used as a soldier, everywhere is the commander, it's not rare anymore." "The red line is a line, not a red patch everywhere, if it's red everywhere, this line is too thick."

Zhou Yang feared that it was not safe to "cut" generally, so he specifically "cut" at key points. He wanted to "remove" the statue of Chairman Mao at the beginning of the exhibition on the history of the New Democratic Revolution; he wanted to "shrink" the calligraphy of the Zunyi Conference; he said about the document of the "Ten-Point Program for National Salvation": "Since there are calligraphy characters, the document is not needed." Look! Zhou Yang's hatred of Mao Zedong Thought had reached such a crazy level!

Fourth is "squeeze." Expand the exhibition area of the Old Democratic Revolution history to "squeeze" out Mao Zedong Thought.

On April 30, 1961, Zhou Yang said: "By 1949, the New Democratic Revolution had been going on for 28 years, and the Old Democratic Revolution had been going on for 81 years, but the exhibition area only accounts for one-sixth." Since it was very close to the July 1st opening at that time, it was not possible to revise, so Zhou Yang arranged this scheme to be implemented after the opening.

A month later, on June 11, 1961, Zhou Yang said again: "I feel that the exhibition area of the Old Democratic Revolution is a bit small. The entire democratic revolution of China includes both the Old Democratic Revolution and the New Democratic Revolution, the former for 81 years, the latter for 28 years. ... But now the exhibition area is 1 to 8, which is too small." He demanded that "the exhibition of the history of the Old Democratic Revolution should occupy one floor in the future." Zhou Yang repeatedly called for the expansion of the exhibition area of the history of the Old Democratic Revolution, aiming to squeeze out the exhibition area of the history of the New Democratic Revolution, to achieve his evil goal of "squeezing" out Mao Zedong Thought.

Due to the wise instructions and warm care of the Party Central Committee, and the boundless love, faith, and admiration of the broad revolutionary cadres for Mao Zedong Thought and Comrade Mao Zedong, the exhibition was repeatedly revised and finally highlighted the red line of Mao Zedong Thought. After being reviewed and approved by the Party Central Committee, it officially opened on July 1, 1961, the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Party. Zhou Yang's criminal activities of opposing Mao Zedong Thought were bankrupt.

Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest directive for all our work, it is our lifeline, it is the beacon of the world's revolutionary people. The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line between who is a true revolutionary and who is a fake revolutionary, a counter-revolutionary, who is Marxism-Leninism and who is revisionism.

Zhou Yang's mad and vicious opposition to Mao Zedong Thought makes him our sworn enemy. We must thoroughly criticize and settle accounts with Zhou Yang's heinous crimes of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought!

　　周扬的罪恶活动彻底破产
　　文化部图博文物局　于坚
    一九五八年底，党中央决定建立中国革命博物馆，突出地宣传毛泽东思想在中国革命历史中的伟大作用。在一九五九年到一九六一年的建馆过程中，周扬抓住这个机会，千方百计反对毛泽东思想。
    周扬反对毛泽东思想的阴谋活动很多，归纳起来有“抹”、“拾”、“砍”、“挤”四种。
    一是“抹”。抹煞毛泽东思想在中国革命史中的伟大作用。
    一九五九年，周扬在领导中国革命史陈列工作过程中，对毛泽东思想在中国革命史中的伟大作用，采取了“一笔抹煞”的态度，自始至终根本不提突出毛泽东思想的伟大作用问题。相反，却荒谬绝伦地提出：“凡是在历史上起过作用的，都不要抹煞。”“如陈独秀要表现”。
    国庆十周年前夕，党中央负责同志审查中国革命史陈列后，一针见血地指出：陈列中缺少毛泽东思想这一条红线。正是由于陈列中存在这样一个根本性的错误，因此没有能够按原定计划在十月一日开馆迎接国庆。
    二是“拾”。拾起赫鲁晓夫反对所谓“个人崇拜”的破烂，反对毛泽东思想。
    一九五九年十月二十九日，修改陈列工作还没开始，周扬就迫不及待地向博物馆全体工作人员作了一个长达两个多小时的报告。他说：“现在要把正确路线突出来，不是突出毛主席个人，不是多挂几个毛主席的象，而是突出毛主席的路线。”周扬以反对“个人迷信”为借口，反对毛泽东思想。这同赫鲁晓夫借口反对“个人崇拜”来反对斯大林、反对马列主义、反对无产阶级专政，不是一个腔调，一样的黑货吗？
    三是“砍”。大刀阔斧地“砍”毛泽东思想的红线。
    一九六一年，陈列修改后，突出了毛泽东思想红线，周扬看到后，一再叫嚷：“红线太多啦”，“红线太粗啦”，“毛主席的东西摆的太多，就不贵重了，到处都是，好象毛主席在给博物馆写标签。”
  一九六一年四月三十日周扬又说：“强调毛泽东思想挂帅，厚今薄古的方向是对的，但帅不能当兵用，到处都是帅就不稀奇了。”“红线是一条线，不是到处一片红，到处都是红，这条线就太粗了。”
    周扬怕笼统地“砍”不保险，又针对关键地方，具体地“砍”。新民主主义革命史开头陈列的毛主席雕象，他要“撤掉”；“遵义会议”的语录字，他要“缩小”；“抗日救国十大纲领”的文件，他说：“有了语录字，文件就不要了。”看！周扬对毛泽东思想的仇视到了如此疯狂的程度！
    四是“挤”。扩大旧民主主义革命史的陈列面积，“挤”掉毛泽东思想。
    一九六一年四月三十日，周扬说：“到一九四九年，新民主主义革命搞了二十八年，旧民主主义革命搞了八十一年，陈列面积却只占六分之一。”由于当时离“七·一”开馆很近，无法修改，周扬又把这一阴谋布置在开馆以后实现。
    一个多月以后，即一九六一年六月十一日，周扬又说：“我感觉旧民主主义革命的陈列面积少了些。整个中国民主革命是包括旧民主主义和新民主主义革命，前者八十一年，后者二十八年。……可是现在陈列面积却是一比八，太少。”他要求“旧民主主义革命史陈列将来占一层楼。”周扬一再叫嚣扩大旧民主主义革命史陈列面积，就是要排挤新民主主义革命史陈列面积，以达到他“挤”掉毛泽东思想的罪恶目的。
    由于党中央的英明指示和亲切关怀，由于广大革命干部对毛泽东思想和毛泽东同志的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜，陈列经过反复修改，终于突出了毛泽东思想红线。经过党中央的审查、批准，一九六一年七月一日党的四十周年诞辰这一天，正式开馆了。周扬反对毛泽东思想的罪恶活动破产了。
    毛主席是我们心中的红太阳。毛泽东思想是我们各项工作的最高指示，是我们的命根子，是世界人民革命的灯塔。对待毛泽东思想的态度，是衡量谁是真革命，谁是假革命、反革命，谁是马克思列宁主义，谁是修正主义的分水岭。
    周扬疯狂地、恶毒地反对毛泽东思想，是我们不共戴天的敌人。我们对周扬反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，必须加以彻底的批判，彻底的清算！
