Johnson, when ordering the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, roared that the United States would see the war of aggression against Vietnam through to the end and "stick it out." He truly put on a ferocious and menacing appearance.

However, there is another face of Johnson, the one portrayed in American newspaper reports about the Johnson in the White House. This Johnson has the Vietnam problem "hanging heavily around his neck," facing "severe" criticism at home, and is in a "dilemma." Before ordering the bombing, he engaged in "rare" and "extremely cautious" planning, sitting and standing uneasily, "highly anxious," like an animal trapped in a cage. Even after ordering the bombing, he did not dare to sleep until three in the morning. This is a Johnson who is guilty and anxious.

Johnson's two faces reveal a truth: American imperialism is a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. Chairman Mao said, "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no power to be reckoned with." Johnson's order to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong is a manifestation of the U.S. aggressors' desperation in the Vietnam War, a sign of a cornered dog lashing out. The more arrogant American imperialism becomes, the more it shows that it is at its wits' end. The further it goes in expanding the war, the closer it gets to complete failure.

### 约翰逊的两副样子

　　约翰逊的两副样子
    约翰逊在下令轰炸河内和海防的时候，气势汹汹地叫嚷美国要把侵略越南的战争“贯彻到底”，“坚持下去”。真是一副张牙舞爪的样子。
    但是，还有另外一副样子的约翰逊，那就是美国报刊报道的在白宫中的约翰逊。这个约翰逊，越南问题“紧紧地挂在他的脖子上”，在国内遭到“严厉”的指责，面对着“进退两难的处境”。他在下令轰炸以前，进行了“罕见的”“小心翼翼的筹划”，坐立不安，“十分担心”，“象关在笼子中的动物”。在下令轰炸以后，一直到晚上三点钟，他还不敢睡觉。这是一个作贼心虚的约翰逊。
    约翰逊的两副样子，说明了一个真理，这就是美帝国主义是一只外强中干的纸老虎。毛主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”约翰逊下令轰炸河内和海防，正是美国侵略者在侵越战争中走投无路，狗急跳墙的表现。美帝国主义越是猖狂，越是表明它穷途末路。它在扩大战争上走得越远，它离彻底失败也就越近了。
