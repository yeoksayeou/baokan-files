People's War: The Key to Defeating American Imperialism!

The Vietnam People's Daily reports that despite the massive deployment of troops and resources, the U.S. cannot avoid defeat.

Editor's Note: The Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism is a vivid lesson for revolutionary peoples around the world. It vividly demonstrates that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger with a strong exterior but a weak core, and that people's war is the most effective weapon against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

Chairman Mao has pointed out: "Just as everything in the world has two aspects (the law of unity of opposites), imperialism and all reactionaries also have two aspects. They are both real tigers and paper tigers." U.S. imperialism is a giant beast, armed to the teeth, devouring people everywhere, a real tiger. But when the oppressed and exploited peoples break the illusion of its "strength" and dare to rise up and fight it, and know how to fight it, U.S. imperialism becomes a paper tiger.

In the current war of aggression in Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is increasingly revealing its true nature as a paper tiger. This report from the Vietnam People's Daily once again forcefully exposes the hollow nature of U.S. imperialism. Revolutionary peoples around the world can see from this that what the Vietnamese people can do, the peoples of other countries can also do, and U.S. imperialism can be completely defeated.

New China News Agency, July 25th: The Vietnam News Agency broadcasted on the 23rd a long report from the Vietnam People's Daily based on facts and figures published by the U.S. and other Western countries. The report powerfully illustrates that despite the massive deployment of troops and resources in the war of aggression against Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors have been defeated by the heroic Vietnamese people who are using the weapon of people's war.

The report states, "The U.S. aggressors have mobilized powerful military and economic forces in an attempt to conquer Vietnam, but they have been and will continue to be defeated by the Vietnamese people, because the Vietnamese people are united and fighting, have the support of the world, adhere to the correct line, and possess the invincible weapon: revolutionary people's war."

In the first part, the report details the troops, weapons, and the massive increase in financial expenditures used by the U.S. aggressors in the war of aggression against Vietnam. The report states that currently, there are 285,000 U.S. troops and 30,000 troops from U.S. puppet regimes in South Vietnam. If we include the 70,000 U.S. troops indirectly participating in the war from the U.S. Seventh Fleet, 15,000 U.S. troops in Thailand, 30,000 U.S. troops in Okinawa, and 8,000 U.S. troops in Guam, the total number of these troops reaches 408,000, which is 40% of the total number of U.S. troops stationed abroad.

The number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam alone accounts for one-third of the total number of U.S. troops stationed abroad. This number is greater than the total number of U.S. ground troops in Europe (240,000) and is approximately 70% of the highest number of U.S. troops fighting on land during the Korean War (400,000).

The report states that the various types of aircraft used by the U.S. in the Vietnam War total 3,500, including 1,700 helicopters. These aircraft are 1.5 times the number of aircraft used by the U.S. in the Korean War (2,230), and the number of fighter jets is one-fourth of the total number of fighter jets owned by the U.S.

The U.S. has deployed 70% of the Seventh Fleet's forces in the war of aggression against Vietnam. This fleet includes 145 warships and 2,700 aircraft. In addition, 11 of the U.S.'s 15 aircraft carriers have been deployed in the Vietnam War.

The report states that, with the exception of nuclear weapons, almost all of the U.S.'s latest weapons have been used in Vietnam. In addition to the latest supersonic jet fighters and B-52 strategic bombers, the U.S. has also transported 2,000 of the latest tanks and armored vehicles, 2,000 cannons of various calibers, and used various chemical poisons and gases to South Vietnam.

The report cites materials published by U.S. News & World Report on June 20, stating that in 1966, the U.S.'s monthly war expenses in Vietnam increased to $2 billion. Thus, the U.S.'s war expenses in 1965 accounted for 27% of the U.S. military budget, and in 1966, it will account for 40%. The war expenses over these two years will be nearly double the expenses of the three-year war in Korea.

In the second part, the report uses specific facts and figures to illustrate the failure of the heavily armed U.S. aggressors. The report states that the "special war" launched by the U.S. in South Vietnam has completely failed. From 1961 to June 1965, a total of 478,700 enemy troops, including 6,074 U.S. troops, were annihilated. During this period, the armed forces and people of South Vietnam completely annihilated 29 enemy battalions; shot down and damaged 1,912 aircraft; defeated the U.S.'s new tactics such as "Flying Eagle" and "armored vehicles"; and destroyed more than 6,000 "strategic villages," causing the enemy's entire "strategic village" system to collapse.

The report states that the "limited war" launched by U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam has also initially failed.

In July 1965, U.S. imperialism began sending large numbers of U.S. troops to South Vietnam.

From July 1965 to June 1966, a total of 299,500 enemy troops, including 63,195 U.S. troops, were annihilated. During this period, the military and people of South Vietnam completely annihilated 61 enemy battalions, including 27 U.S. battalions; shot down and damaged 2,470 aircraft; and destroyed 2,686 military vehicles, including 867 tanks and armored vehicles.

During this period, almost all U.S. combat units suffered heavy losses. For example, the U.S. First Cavalry Division (Airmobile) had three battalions completely annihilated, the U.S. Marine Corps First and Third Divisions had three battalions completely annihilated; the U.S. 25th Infantry Division had one battalion completely annihilated; the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade had one battalion completely annihilated.

The report states that the destructive air war launched by the U.S. in North Vietnam has also basically failed. From August 5, 1964, to July 20, 1966, the military and people of North Vietnam shot down 1,233 U.S. aircraft (including more than 30 types), damaged many, and captured a large number of U.S. air pirates, shattering the myth of U.S. air "superiority."

The report in the third and fourth parts also cites facts revealed by U.S. and other Western countries' newspapers to illustrate the truth about the U.S.'s shortage of troops and weapons, transportation and supply difficulties, economic difficulties, increased taxes, currency inflation, and sharp decline in gold reserves in the war of aggression against Vietnam. It also cites the words of U.S. officials to illustrate the U.S.'s desperate situation and inevitable failure in the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    人民战争，这是战胜美帝国主义的法宝！
    越南《人民报》报道指出美帝投入大量兵力物力也挽救不了失败命运
    编者按：越南人民的抗美战争，对于全世界革命人民，是最生动的活教材。它雄辩地证明了美帝国主义是外强中干的纸老虎，证明了人民战争是对付美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝。
    毛主席曾经指出：“同世界上一切事物无不具有两重性（即对立统一规律）一样，帝国主义和一切反动派也有两重性，它们是真老虎又是纸老虎。”美帝国主义是个庞然大物，它武装到了牙齿，到处要吃人，是只真老虎。但是，当被侵略和被压迫的人民，破除了对它的“强大”的迷信，敢于起来同它进行斗争，并且善于同它斗争，美帝国主义就成了纸老虎。
    美帝国主义在目前侵越战争中，越来越暴露出了它的纸老虎的原形。越南《人民报》的这篇报道，又一次有力地揭穿了美帝国主义外强中干的本质。全世界革命人民从这里可以看到，越南人民能做到的，各国人民也能做到，美帝国主义是完全可以打败的。
    新华社二十五日讯　越南通讯社二十三日广播了越南《人民报》根据美国和其它西方国家公布的事实和数字编写的长篇报道，雄辩地说明美国侵略者虽然在侵越战争中投入大量的兵力和物力，但是仍然被使用人民战争法宝的英雄的越南人民打得惨败。
    报道说，“美国侵略者调动了强大的军事和财经力量妄图征服越南，但是他们过去和现在都已被越南人民打败，将来也一定被越南人民打败，因为越南人民是团结和战斗的，得到全世界的支持，贯彻正确的路线，并且有着战无不胜的武器：革命的人民战争。”
    这篇报道在第一部分详细谈到了美国侵略者在侵略越南战争中使用的兵力、武器和大量增加的财政开支等情况。报道说，目前在越南南方有二十八万五千名美军和三万名美国的仆从军队。如果包括间接参战的属于美国第七舰队的七万名美军，在泰国的一万五千名美军，在冲绳的三万名美军，在关岛的八千名美军，这些部队的总人数达到四十万零八千人，相等于美国驻外部队总数的百分之四十。
    仅在越南南方的美军人数就占美国驻外部队总数的三分之一。这个数字大于美国驻欧洲的地面部队总人数（二十四万人），约相等于在朝鲜战争中在陆地上作战的美军最多人数（四十万人）的百分之七十。
    报道说，美国在越南战争中使用的各种类型的飞机共达三千五百架，其中包括一千七百架直升飞机。这些飞机相当于美国在朝鲜战争时使用的两千二百三十架飞机的一点五倍，而其中战斗机相当于美国拥有的战斗机总数的四分之一。
    美国在侵略越南战争中部署了第七舰队的百分之七十的兵力，这支舰队包括有一百四十五艘军舰和二千七百架飞机。此外，美国的十五艘航空母舰中已有十一艘投入了越南战争。
    报道说，除了原子武器以外，美国所有最新式的武器几乎都在越南用上了。除了最新式的超音速喷气战斗机和Ｂ—52战略轰炸机以外，美国还向越南南方运入了两千辆最新式的坦克和装甲车、两千门各种口径的大炮，使用了各种化学毒药和毒气。
    报道援引《美国新闻与世界报道》六月二十日公布的材料说，在一九六六年，美国每个月的（侵越）战争费用增加到二十亿美元。这样，美国一九六五年的战争费用已占美国军事预算的百分之二十七，而在一九六六年将占百分之四十。这两年里美国的战争费用要比三年的侵朝战争的费用几乎多一倍。
    越南通讯社的这则报道在第二部分用具体事实和数字说明了武装到牙齿的美国侵略者的失败情况。报道说，美国在越南南方发动的“特种”战争已经彻底破产。从一九六一年到一九六五年六月，美伪军共被歼灭四十七万八千七百人，其中有美军六千零七十四人。在这期间，越南南方解放武装力量和人民共全歼敌军二十九个营；击落击伤飞机一千九百十二架；打败了美国的“飞鹰”“装甲车”等新战术；捣毁了六千多个“战略村”，使得敌人的整个“战略村”系统破产。
    报道说，美帝国主义在越南南方发动的“局部战争”也宣告初步失败。
    一九六五年七月，美帝国主义开始派遣大批美军到越南南方。
    在从一九六五年七月到一九六六年六月期间，美伪军共被歼灭二十九万九千五百人，其中包括美军六万三千一百九十五人，在这期间，越南南方军民共全歼敌人六十一个营，其中包括二十七个美军营；击落和击伤敌机两千四百七十架；击毁军车两千六百八十六辆，其中有坦克和装甲车八百六十七辆。
    在这期间，几乎所有的美国战斗部队都遭到惨重损失。例如美国第一骑兵师（空中机动师）被全歼三个营，美国海军陆战队第一和第三师被全歼三个营；美国第二十五步兵师被全歼一个营；美国第一百七十三空降旅被全歼一个营。
    报道说，美国在越南北方进行的破坏性空战，也基本上失败了。从一九六四年八月五日到一九六六年七月二十日，越南北方军民共击落美国飞机一千二百三十三架（包括三十多种类型），击伤多架，并且俘虏了大批美国空中强盗，粉碎了美国空中“优势”的神话。
    这则报道在第三部分和第四部分还引用美国和其它西方国家报刊透露的事实说明了美国在侵越战争中兵源和武器缺乏、运输和供应困难、经济困难、税收增加、通货膨胀、黄金储备锐减等真相，并且引用美国官方人士的话说明了美国在侵越战争中走投无路的窘境和必然失败的前途。（附图片）
