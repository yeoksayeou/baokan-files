Edition: 3

Liu Yingjun, a soldier in the same company, and local residents recall his life story. Numerous vivid episodes demonstrate that Liu Yingjun was a revolutionary soldier of the proletariat who regarded Chairman Mao's works as the supreme directive for all actions. They say that Liu Yingjun truly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works well, and can be considered an exemplary executor of the supreme directive, a soldier of Chairman Mao like Lei Feng and Wang Jie.

Liu Yingjun had an infinite love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and an infinite faith in Mao Zedong Thought. He had four portraits of Chairman Mao hanging around his dormitory. Whenever he went on a field exercise or moved, his first task was to take down the portraits of Chairman Mao and protect them; upon arriving at a new location, his first task was to hang up the portraits of Chairman Mao. This spring festival, before leaving the company to visit his family, he specially instructed the platoon leader, saying: "If our platoon moves, the portraits of Chairman Mao must be entrusted to someone. Upon arriving at the new location, hang up the portraits of Chairman Mao first, so that comrades can see Chairman Mao every day."

Liu Yingjun had deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's works. He said: "Forgetting Chairman Mao's words is like forgetting past hardships and your responsibilities." He studied Chairman Mao's works with the greatest diligence and perseverance, repeatedly studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "Against Liberalism," and reading through "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Besides insisting on "daily reading," he seized every opportunity to study, sometimes standing guard late at night and still reading a passage from Chairman Mao's works and writing some notes under the lamp.

Liu Yingjun was determined to walk the path of heroic growth. From his diary, it can be seen that almost all heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought, whether Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Liu Huilan, or Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, he took them all as his learning examples. When Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng," he wrote this sentence in his notebook, wrote it on the wall, carved it on the hoe handle, and imprinted it in his heart, putting it into action. He expressed in his diary that he would definitely "take up Lei Feng and Wang Jie's guns, carry the revolution to the end; take up their diaries, finish writing the diaries they left unfinished, and strive for the cause of communism for life."

Liu Yingjun never forgot that he was the son of a poor peasant. After enlisting, he underwent class education, especially the socialist education in early 1964, deeply studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, clearly establishing the viewpoint of class struggle. He wrote in his study notes: "Today's domestic and international class struggles are extremely sharp and complex. Imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries are all vying for the younger generation, using various forms of bourgeois ideology to corrupt the youth... attempting to place their hopes of counter-revolutionary restoration on the degeneration of the younger generation." In actual actions, he strove to follow Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and class analysis, viewing everything and handling everything.

Liu Yingjun truly worked hard on transforming his worldview through studying Chairman Mao's works. He possessed a thorough spirit of self-revolution, consciously using the weapon of self-criticism to resolutely fight against individualistic thoughts and other non-proletarian consciousness. Once he discovered his own shortcomings, he would frankly admit them, actively examine himself, and resolutely correct them. His diary is filled with self-criticism, serving as a record of a battle using Mao Zedong Thought to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. The comrades in the company all remember an incident: one cold night, Liu Yingjun returned from guard duty and voluntarily used a piece of wood to nail up a broken window in the stable; then, he studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune." The guard on duty, Xiong Zhiyi, asked him why he wasn't sleeping yet, and he said: "This broken window has been noticed for a long time, why didn't I think to fix it before. I need to find the reason." The reason he found was, "I still lack the spirit of being extremely responsible for revolutionary work like Comrade Norman Bethune."

In revolutionary practice, Liu Yingjun steadily and bit by bit transformed himself, raising his class consciousness. He often used holidays and days off to enthusiastically and sincerely do good deeds for the people, carrying water, sweeping the floor, carrying grain, pushing carts, laying paths, repairing wells, and doing anything beneficial to the people with all his might. In the company, he was also a "busybody," repairing tables and chairs, making mailboxes, organizing tools, and silently doing anything beneficial to the company's construction. Comrades said: "Liu Yingjun's good deeds are impossible to count with numbers." He did so many good deeds, never leaving his name, never reporting, and never recording them in his diary, not having the slightest intention of showing off, but consciously treating them as revolutionary practice. He wrote in his diary: "Only those who contribute everything for the revolution are truly people. Can I become such a person? This remains to be tested by practice. I truly feel that 'practice is the touchstone of truth,' and I will be tested by practice."

Liu Yingjun was like this, through studying Chairman Mao's works and practicing, gradually establishing a proletarian worldview. He said: "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai, and to live for the people's interests is also heavier than Mount Tai." "To make a revolution, one must fight; to fear struggle is to inevitably not dare to make a revolution. For us proletarian revolutionaries, we have devoted everything to the revolutionary cause of communism, apart from participating in revolutionary struggle, what greater happiness is there?" He had a broad vision for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Every time Chairman Mao issued statements supporting the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of various countries, he enthusiastically responded and clearly expressed his determination to support the world revolution. Once, he went shopping and saw in the newspaper that Chairman Mao had issued a statement supporting the Congolese (Leopoldville) people's struggle against American aggression. He immediately bought a newspaper and rushed back to the company to organize the entire platoon to study. That night, he wrote a long poem titled "Chairman Mao's Statement Shines the World" with great excitement, expressing that as soon as the country gives the order, he would immediately march out and, together with the Congolese (Leopoldville) brothers, annihilate the aggressors. When American imperialism expanded its aggression in the Vietnam War, he immediately wrote an application to participate in the struggle to aid Vietnam and resist America.

Liu Yingjun insisted on prioritizing politics and actively participating in the class struggle in the ideological realm. He resolutely resisted the influence of purely military viewpoints, whether demanding of himself or helping others, always placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works first. In 1964, he was transferred to the artillery training team to learn technology. At that time, when military matters overshadowed political matters, he insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works every day. During the "One Red" activity with a platoon leader from the same company, the platoon leader insisted that he use Sundays to intensively study military matters, but he still insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works and doing mass work on Sundays. He was very concerned about the company's political and ideological construction, actively doing a lot of political and ideological work. For phenomena that did not conform to the Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao's directives on prioritizing politics, he would carefully record them and, whenever there was an opportunity, report to the leadership until they were completely corrected.

Liu Yingjun was a vanguard on the company's cultural revolution front. He repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and suggested organizing cultural and entertainment cadres to study. He said that small programs should have a grand direction and insist on Chairman Mao's guidance that literature and art serve proletarian politics. Over the past year, he wrote and revised more than ten cultural and entertainment programs, drew twenty-three sets of slides, and produced more than sixty blackboard newspapers, enthusiastically praising the Party and Chairman Mao, and praising heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought. These activities strongly supported the company's class education and situation education, playing a role in consolidating and enhancing the company's combat effectiveness.

In the class struggle in the ideological realm, Liu Yingjun's position was firm, and his sense of smell was keen. He actively participated in the struggle and bravely defended Mao Zedong Thought. He had a book titled "Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique," which stated in the preface and in the People's Daily editorial that we must not only be good at distinguishing between good and bad people in normal situations but also be good at distinguishing between certain people in special situations. "We must also deeply understand that as long as members of our revolutionary ranks are politically complacent and lose vigilance against counter-revolutionaries, it will provide conditions for these counter-revolutionary elements to carry out activities." Liu Yingjun often took out this book to study it carefully. In 1964, he wrote an article angrily refuting Feng Ding's so-called "justice impulse theory." As early as the end of 1964, after watching the movie "The Enemy at the Gate," he told his comrades that this was a bad movie that violated Chairman Mao's military thoughts and artistic line and should be criticized. When the People's Liberation Army Daily published Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On the New Historical Drama 'The Dismissal of Hai Rui'" criticizing Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, he immediately organized the entire platoon to study.

Liu Yingjun enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought. He propagated in the company, to the masses, to school teachers and children, and to relatives and friends. As an outside instructor, the first time he spoke to the children, he talked about reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and being a good child of Chairman Mao. He saw some children drawing "Bao Gong" and told them: "Red youths should draw red heroes." He saw some children reading the comic book "Chasing Fish" and told them: "Red youths should read red books." In letters to classmates, teachers, and relatives, he hoped they would study Chairman Mao's works well, talked about his own experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works and transforming his thoughts, and propagated Comrade Lin Biao's directive to "study with problems, actively study and apply, combine study and use, study urgently when needed, and see immediate results." He often used Chairman Mao's words in his letters to help the other party solve problems and often wrote a quotation from Chairman Mao on the envelope so that the other party would see Chairman Mao's words first. He propagated Mao Zedong Thought with a fighting spirit, and many letters were written at midnight using the time before or after going on duty. On March 12, just three days before his glorious sacrifice, he wrote two letters. One was the fourth time urging a classmate to go to the countryside, quoting three passages from Chairman Mao in the letter, one of which was what Chairman Mao said in "The Orientation of the Youth Movement": "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard do we use? What do we use to distinguish them? There is only one standard, that is, whether they are willing and whether they actually combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants." The other letter was written to a comrade participating in the socialist education movement in the countryside, saying: "...I hope you can pass the Party's test, prioritize the Party's interests, study Chairman Mao's works more, guide your thoughts and actions, and arm your mind." It can be said that Liu Yingjun regarded propagating Mao Zedong Thought as his lifelong battle mission.

The Party Committee of Liu Yingjun's unit pointed out in its decision that the emergence of this heroic figure was the result of implementing the resolutions of the Military Commission's expanded meeting, hoisting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works; it was the result of prioritizing politics, insisting on the Four Firsts, and creating excellent companies and excellent soldiers. Liu Yingjun was a great communist soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought, like Lei Feng and Wang Jie. Carrying out the activities of propagating and learning from Comrade Liu Yingjun is an important measure to continue implementing Comrade Lin Biao's five principles of prioritizing politics and implementing the spirit of the whole army's political work conference.

Just as the unit where Liu Yingjun was located was carrying out the activities of learning from Comrade Liu Yingjun, a great upsurge of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat swept across the country. Liu Yingjun's former comrades-in-arms all resolutely expressed that they would, like Liu Yingjun, love the Party and Chairman Mao, arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the struggle, open fire on the bourgeois black gangs that are anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, insist on the dictatorship of the proletariat, insist on the socialist system, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and sweep away all ghosts and monsters.

    最高指示的模范执行者——刘英俊
　　连队战友和当地群众回忆刘英俊同志的生平
    刘英俊同志所在连队的干部战士和当地群众回忆了他的生平，大量的生动事迹说明，刘英俊是一个把毛主席的书当作一切行动最高指示的无产阶级革命战士。他们说，刘英俊同志学习毛主席著作确实学得好，用得好，称得上是最高指示的模范执行者，是雷锋、王杰式的毛主席的好战士。
　　无限热爱党，无限热爱毛主席
    刘英俊同志无限地热爱党和毛主席，无限地信仰毛泽东思想。他有四幅毛主席象，悬挂在宿舍的四周。每次野营或搬家时，他的第一件事就是把毛主席象取下来，保护好；到了新驻地，他的第一件事就是把毛主席象悬挂起来。今年春节，他探家离连以前，专门找班长交代说：“咱们班要是挪动地方，毛主席象一定要有专人负责。到了新的驻地，先把毛主席象挂起来，好让同志们天天看到毛主席。”
    刘英俊同志对毛主席著作怀有深厚的阶级感情，他说：“忘掉了毛主席的话，就等于忘掉了过去的苦处和你的责任。”他学习毛主席著作最刻苦，最勤奋，反复学习了“老三篇”和《反对自由主义》，并通读了《毛泽东选集》。除了坚持“天天读”以外，他还抓紧一切时间学习，有时深更半夜站哨回来，还在灯下读一段毛主席著作，写一段心得笔记。
    刘英俊同志决心走英雄成长的道路。从他的日记中看到，几乎所有用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄，无论是董存瑞、黄继光、刘胡兰，还是雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄，他都作为自己学习的榜样。毛主席发出“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召，他把这句话记在本子上，写在墙壁上，刻在锄柄上，印在心坎上，落在行动上，始终是象雷锋那样，活学活用毛主席著作。他在日记中表示，一定要“接过雷锋和王杰的枪，把革命进行到底；接过他们的日记，把他们没写完的日记写下去，为共产主义事业奋斗终身。”
　  活学活用毛主席著作，在改造世界观上狠下功夫
    刘英俊同志始终没有忘记自己是贫农的儿子。入伍后，他经过阶级教育，特别是经过一九六四年初的社会主义教育，深入地学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，明确地树立了阶级斗争观点。他在学习心得中写道：“今天国内外的阶级斗争，是极为尖锐复杂的，帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派都在争夺青年一代，他们用形形色色的资产阶级思想来腐蚀青年……企图把反革命复辟的希望寄托在年青一代的变质上。”在实际行动中，他努力按照毛主席关于阶级斗争和阶级分析的教导，看待一切事物，处理一切问题。
    刘英俊同志学习毛主席著作，真正在改造世界观上狠下了功夫。他具有彻底的自我革命精神，能自觉地运用自我批评的武器，向个人主义思想和其他非无产阶级意识坚决斗争。他一发现自己的缺点，就坦率承认，主动检查，坚决纠正。他的日记充满了自我批评，是一部以毛泽东思想为武器，兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想的战斗记录。连队的同志都记得这样一件事：一个寒夜，刘英俊下哨回来，主动用一块木板把马房的一个破窗洞钉好了；接着，他又学习《纪念白求恩》。带哨的熊志毅问他为什么还不睡，他说：“这个破窗洞早就发现了，为什么过去没有想到去堵。我要找找原因。”他找出的原因是，“还缺乏象白求恩同志那样对革命工作极端负责的精神”。
    刘英俊同志在革命实践中，踏踏实实、一点一滴地改造自己，提高阶级觉悟。他经常利用节日、假日，热情洋溢、诚心诚意地为人民群众做好事，挑水、扫地、背粮、推车、垫路、修井，凡是对群众有益的事他都不遗余力地做。在连队里，他也是个“老不闲”，修桌椅、做信箱、整工具，凡是有益连队建设的活他都不声不响地干。战友们说：“刘英俊做的好事，是无法用数字来计算的。”他做这么多好事，从来不留名，不汇报，也不在日记里记载，丝毫没有一点显示自己的意思，而是自觉地当作革命的实践。他在日记中写道：“为革命贡献自己一切的人，才算是一个真正的人。我能否成为这样的人，还有待于实践。我确实深深体会到，‘实践是检验真理的试金石’，我将受实践的考验。”
    刘英俊同志就是这样，通过学习毛主席著作和实践的锻炼，逐步树立无产阶级世界观。他说：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重，为人民利益而活着的人，也比那泰山还重。”“要革命就要斗争，害怕斗争就必然不敢革命。对于我们无产阶级革命者来说，我们的一切都献给了共产主义的革命事业，除了参加革命斗争以外，还有什么比这更大的幸福呢？”他胸怀中国革命和世界革命，每当毛主席发表关于支持各国人民反帝革命斗争的声明，他都热烈响应，明确地表示自己支援世界革命的决心。有一次，他上街买东西，看到报纸上发表了毛主席关于支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明，他马上买了一份报纸，赶回连队，组织全班同志学习。当天晚上，他以《毛主席声明照全球》为题，激动地写了一首长诗，表示只要祖国一声令下，就立即出征，和刚果（利）兄弟一起消灭侵略者。当美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的时候，他立即写了申请书，要求参加援越抗美斗争。
    坚持突出政治，积极参加意识形态领域的阶级斗争
    刘英俊同志坚持突出政治的方向。他坚决抵制单纯军事观点的影响，无论是要求自己还是帮助别人，都把活学活用毛主席著作放在第一位。一九六四年，他调到炮兵集训队学习技术，在当时军事冲击政治的情况下，他始终坚持天天学习毛主席著作。在和本连同来的一个班长搞“一对红”活动时，班长一定要他利用星期天突击学军事，他仍然坚持在星期天学习毛主席著作和做群众工作。他非常关心连队的政治思想建设，主动做了许多政治思想工作。对于不符合军委和林彪同志关于突出政治指示的一些现象，他都认真地记下来，一有机会就向领导提出意见，直到完全纠正为止。
    刘英俊同志是连队文化革命战线上的尖兵。他反复学习毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，还建议组织文娱骨干进行学习。他说，小节目要有大方向，要坚持毛主席教导的文艺为无产阶级政治服务。去年以来，他编写和改编了十多个文娱节目，画了二十三部幻灯片，出了六十多期黑板报，热情地歌颂党和毛主席，歌颂毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物。这些活动，有力地配合了连队阶级教育和形势教育，起到了巩固和提高部队战斗力的作用。
    在意识形态领域的阶级斗争中，刘英俊同志立场坚定，嗅觉锐敏，积极地参加斗争，勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想。他有一本《关于胡风反革命集团的材料》，这本材料的序言和《人民日报》社论中指出，我们不仅要善于辨别在正常情况下从事活动的坏人和好人；还要善于辨别在特殊情况下从事活动的某些人们。“我们还必须深刻认识，只要我们革命队伍的成员在政治上麻痹大意，对反革命丧失警惕，那就会提供这些反革命分子以进行活动的条件。”刘英俊同志经常把这本材料拿出来认真学习。一九六四年，他写过一篇文章，愤怒地驳斥了冯定的所谓“正义冲动论”。早在一九六四年底，他看了电影《兵临城下》以后，就向同志们说，这是一部违反毛主席军事思想和文艺路线的坏电影，应该批判。当《解放军报》发表了姚文元同志批判吴晗反党反社会主义罪行的文章《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》时，他立即组织全班同志学习。
    刘英俊同志热情地宣传毛泽东思想。他在连队宣传，还向群众宣传，向学校的老师和孩子们宣传，向亲友们宣传。他当校外辅导员，第一次给小朋友讲话，就讲读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好孩子。他看见有的小朋友画“包公”，就告诉他说：“红色少年应该画红色英雄。”他看见有的小朋友看小人书《追鱼》，就告诉他说：“红色少年应该看红色书籍。”他在给同学、老师、亲友的信中，希望他们很好地学习毛主席著作，跟他们谈自己学习毛主席著作、进行思想改造的心得，向他们宣传林彪同志“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”的指示。他在信中常常用毛主席的话，来帮助对方解决问题，还常常在信封上写一条毛主席语录，让对方第一眼就看到毛主席的话。他以战斗精神宣传毛泽东思想，不少信都是在半夜里利用上岗前或下岗后的机会写出来的。三月十二日，也就是他光荣牺牲的前三天，他就写了两封信。一封是第四次劝一位同学下农村，信中引用了毛主席的三段话，有一段是毛主席在《青年运动的方向》中所说的：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”另一封信写给一位参加农村社会主义教育运动的同志，信上说：“……望你能经得起党对你的考验，要以党的利益为重，多学习毛主席著作，来指导自己的思想与行动，武装自己的头脑。”可以说，刘英俊同志把宣传毛泽东思想当作了毕生的战斗任务。
    刘英俊同志所在部队党委在决定中指出，刘英俊这个英雄人物的出现，是贯彻军委扩大会议决议，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作的结果；是突出政治，坚持四个第一，创造四好连队和五好战士的结果。刘英俊同志是毛泽东思想武装起来的雷锋、王杰式的伟大的共产主义战士。开展宣传和学习刘英俊同志的活动，是继续贯彻林彪同志关于突出政治五项原则和贯彻全军政治工作会议精神的一个重要措施。
    正当刘英俊同志所在部队开展向刘英俊同志学习活动的时候，全国轰轰烈烈地掀起了无产阶级文化大革命的高潮。刘英俊同志生前战友都坚决表示，要象刘英俊那样，热爱党和毛主席，用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来，积极参加斗争，向反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级黑帮开火，坚持无产阶级专政，坚持社会主义制度，捍卫毛泽东思想，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。　　　　　　　　（本版转载《解放军报》）（附图片）
