	Cameroon Representative Feze Marcel today at the emergency conference of Asian and African writers emphasized that to oppose the main enemy, American imperialism, we must unite all forces that can be united and form an anti-American united front. However, unity must be principled and we must not trade principles. Fake revolutionaries have destroyed the common foundation of unity. We cannot engage in joint actions with fake revolutionaries.

	Feze said, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Asian and African writers should combine the pen with the gun. The fundamental point to ensure the victory of the anti-imperialist struggle is the gun. Merely using the pen cannot defeat imperialism and its running dogs.

	Feze denounced that the Soviet leaders have betrayed the interests of the Soviet people and the people of the world, and have engaged in joint actions with the imperialists. Therefore, to better oppose imperialism led by the United States, we must oppose the fake revolutionaries. He said, indulging accomplices is a very serious legal error.

	Feze said, where there is imperialism and its running dogs' aggression and oppression, there is the people's resistance and struggle. Chairman Mao Zedong said, "Imperialism has prepared the conditions for its own doom. The awakening of the masses of the people in the colonies and semi-colonies and the people in the imperialist countries themselves is such a condition. Imperialism drives the masses of the people of the whole world to the great struggle to eliminate imperialism in this historical era." This scientific analysis correctly reflects the dialectical law of historical development. Imperialism led by the American bandits and all reactionaries are doomed to failure, and the evil system of capitalist exploitation is doomed to perish completely.

	Feze said, the brilliant victory of the Vietnamese people's anti-American struggle further proves the correctness of Chairman Mao Zedong's theory of people's war. American imperialism seems strong, but a united and determined people can defeat it. What decides the outcome of a war is people with revolutionary consciousness, not any modern weapons.

	Feze emphasized the need to establish an international anti-American united front as called for by Chairman Mao Zedong. He said, only by uniting and uniting with all forces that can be united in the world revolution can the oppressed peoples of the world defeat imperialism.

	He stressed that the unity of the people of the world must be principled. We must not trade principles. We must wage a principled struggle against opportunists, for without struggle, we cannot make smooth progress.

	Feze said, fake revolutionaries have destroyed the common foundation of unity. When these fake revolutionaries openly advocate "peaceful coexistence" and "peaceful competition" with imperialism, plot "peace talks" on the Vietnamese issue, and sabotage the unity of Asian and African writers, how can we engage in counter-revolutionary joint actions with these clown-like so-called revolutionaries?

	He said, these so-called revolutionaries are engaged in sabotage activities against the revolutionary movement in Cameroon. The Soviet leaders and their French revisionist accomplices have gathered a number of counter-revolutionaries, causing serious splits among the revolutionaries in Cameroon. In such a situation, how can we engage in joint actions with them? This is absolutely impossible because there is a fundamental line of demarcation between revolutionaries and traitors.

	He said, Asian and African writers should unite with workers and peasants. The working masses are the creators of the history of all nations. Only when tens of millions of workers and peasants have political consciousness and are organized can there be a powerful force to destroy the old system and build a new society. Without the main force of workers and peasants, it is impossible for the revolutionary writers of Asian and African countries to wage a struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism and achieve victory.

	He said, Asian and African revolutionary writers should join the people of all countries in the struggle to bury the root of war—the imperialist system. To oppose imperialism, we must expose all kinds of reformism and opportunism that serve imperialism, and wage an uncompromising struggle against the accomplices of imperialism.

	He finally said, we Asian and African writers must raise the banner of anti-imperialist revolution higher and resolutely oppose the "three evils" of imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionism.

    喀麦隆代表费则的发言
    新华社三十日讯　喀麦隆代表费则·马赛尔今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上强调说，要反对主要敌人美帝国主义，就必须团结一切可以团结的力量，结成反美统一战线。但是，团结应当是有原则的，决不能拿原则来作交易。假革命者破坏了团结的共同基础。我们不能同假革命者搞联合行动。
    费则说，“枪杆子里面出政权”。亚非作家应该把笔杆和枪杆结合起来运用。为了保证反帝斗争的胜利，根本的一点是靠枪杆子。仅仅用笔杆子是不能战胜帝国主义及其走狗的。
    费则谴责说，苏联领导人背叛了苏联人民和世界人民的利益，同帝国主义者搞联合行动，为此，要更好地反对以美国为首的帝国主义，就必须反对假革命派。他说，对帮凶者放纵，就是在法律上犯了十分严重的错误。
    费则说，那里有帝国主义及其走狗的侵略和压迫，那里就有人民的反抗和斗争。毛泽东主席说，“帝国主义给自己准备了灭亡的条件。殖民地半殖民地的人民大众和帝国主义自己国家内的人民大众的觉悟，就是这样的条件。帝国主义驱使全世界的人民大众走上消灭帝国主义的伟大斗争的历史时代。”这种科学的分析正确地反映了世界历史发展的历史辩证法。以美国强盗为首的帝国主义和一切反动派都注定是要失败的，万恶的资本剥削的制度注定是要彻底灭亡的。
    费则说，越南人民反美斗争的光辉胜利更加证明了毛泽东主席关于人民战争理论的正确。美帝国主义貌似强大，而团结坚定的人民是可以把它打败的。决定战争胜负的是具有革命觉悟的人，而不是任何现代化的武器。
    费则强调要按照毛泽东主席所号召的建立一个国际反美统一战线。他说，只有团结起来，并且同世界革命中一切可以团结的力量团结起来，世界被压迫人民才能战胜帝国主义。
    他强调说，全世界人民的团结应当有原则。我们决不能拿原则来作交易。必须同机会主义者进行原则的斗争，没有斗争就不可能顺利前进。
    费则说，假革命派破坏了团结的共同基础。当这些假革命派公开推行同帝国主义搞“和平共处”、“和平竞赛”，在越南问题上策划“和平谈判”的阴谋，并且破坏亚非作家团结的时候，我们怎么能同这些跳梁小丑式的所谓革命者搞反革命的联合行动呢？
    他说，这些所谓革命者正在进行破坏活动反对喀麦隆的革命运动。苏联领导人及其法国修正主义同伙曾经纠集了一些反革命分子，在喀麦隆革命者中间制造了严重的分裂。在这样的情况下我们能同他们搞联合行动吗？这是绝对办不到的，因为在革命者和叛徒之间，存在着全面的路线的分歧。
    他说，亚非作家应该和工人、农民结合起来。工农群众是各民族历史的创造者。只有当千百万工人和农民有了政治觉悟，并组织起来的时候，才能有一支强大的力量去破坏旧制度，建设一个新社会。如果没有工人和农民这个主要力量，仅仅依靠亚非国家的革命作家是不可能进行反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争并取得胜利的。
    他说，亚非革命作家应该同各国人民一道，为埋葬战争的根源——帝国主义制度的崇高斗争而努力。要反对帝国主义，就必须揭露一切为帝国主义效劳的形形色色的改良主义和机会主义，要同帝国主义的帮凶进行无情的斗争。
    他最后说，我们亚非作家要更高地举起反帝革命的旗帜，坚决地反对帝国主义、反动派和现代修正主义这“三害”。
