The struggle of American blacks against discrimination, oppression, and exploitation is increasingly breaking free from the constraints of "non-violence" imposed by right-wing leaders and is heading towards using revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on July 16, our correspondent reports: The struggle of American blacks against discrimination, oppression, and exploitation is increasingly breaking free from the constraints of "non-violence" imposed by right-wing leaders and is heading towards using revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence.

The intense anti-violence struggle by blacks in Chicago over the past few days is a new high point in the black protesters' fearless fights against armed police and racist elements across the country over the past few months. The number of such armed anti-violence struggles by blacks in recent times has far exceeded previous years.

The violent self-defense struggle by blacks in Caddo, Georgia, which broke out in late June, lasted for nearly two weeks. At the end of June in the northern industrial city of Cleveland, hundreds of black protesters used stones, bricks, and Molotov cocktails to confront the police who came to suppress them, and the struggle lasted for four nights; the authorities even deployed helicopters to participate in the suppression activities. In early July, in Omaha, Nebraska, black masses fought with the police for three days and nights.

Prior to this, in June, blacks in Mississippi, where racial discrimination is rampant, held a "Freedom March." During the march, blacks for the first time raised the slogan "Black Power." This slogan quickly gained the support of a wide range of blacks in the South and North. During the three-week, 260-mile march, the demonstrators were under the surveillance and encirclement of armed military police every day. Initially, there were only seven people who started the march, but by the time they reached the destination of Jackson, the number had increased to several thousand; and the number of black masses who attended the anti-racial oppression rally held that day in front of the state legislature reached 50,000. Throughout the march, the demonstrators remained spirited. They declared the bankruptcy of "non-violence" through their actions. When racist elements opened fire to provoke, some of the demonstrators immediately fired back.

The struggle of American blacks is a life-and-death class struggle. In the struggle, blacks are increasingly adopting revolutionary violence, which makes the American reactionary ruling class extremely uneasy.

The high morale of the black masses is also reflected in the recent personnel changes and policy shifts in some important black organizations in the United States. The "Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee," which actively organized blacks in the South to participate in the struggle, changed its leadership in May this year to a more militant one that openly advocates armed self-defense. This organization also openly opposes the government's policy of invading Vietnam. Another black organization, the "Congress of Racial Equality," formally passed a resolution at its annual meeting in early July, announcing the abandonment of the "non-violence" it had consistently followed for more than 20 years and openly advocating that blacks have the right to self-defense and counterattack when faced with violent persecution. The new leadership, which took office in March this year, emphasized that "the philosophy of non-violence is on the verge of collapse."

In addition, it is reported that the strength of some black armed self-defense organizations in the United States is rapidly growing. For example, the "Deacons for Defense and Justice" organization, which was newly established last year, has already established dozens of branches in five southern states. Another organization is the "Revolutionary Action Movement" based in Philadelphia, whose activities have expanded to northern industrial centers such as New York, Chicago, and Detroit.

The history of the struggle of American blacks has proven that the ruling class's violent suppression will only accelerate the awakening of the broad black masses, making more people realize that the only way out is to resolutely "fight violence with violence." The flames of armed anti-violence struggles by black masses will eventually spread across the entire United States.

　　美国黑人斗争正在冲破“非暴力主义”的束缚
　　走上以革命暴力对付反革命暴力的道路
    据新华社十六日讯　本社记者报道：美国黑人反歧视、反压迫、反剥削的斗争，正日益冲破右翼领导人“非暴力主义”的束缚，开始走上以革命的暴力对付反革命暴力的道路。
    芝加哥黑人在最近几天里进行的如火如荼的抗暴斗争，是近几个月来在美国各地不断爆发的黑人示威者不畏强暴，同武装军警和种族主义分子英勇搏斗的新高潮。最近发生的这种黑人武装抗暴斗争次数之多，大大超过往年。
    六月下旬在佐治亚州考德尔爆发的黑人暴力自卫斗争前后持续达两周之久。六月末在北部工业城市克利夫兰，数百名黑人示威者用石块、砖头和燃烧瓶迎击前来镇压的警察，斗争坚持了四个晚上；当局甚至出动直升飞机参加镇压活动。七月初，在内布拉斯加州的奥马哈市，黑人群众同警察奋战了三昼夜。
    在这以前，六月间在种族歧视最猖獗的密西西比州黑人举行“争取自由进军”。在进军中，黑人们第一次提出了“黑人要权力”的口号。这个口号在美国南北各地迅即得到广大黑人的响应。在历时三周、行程两百六十多英里的进军途中，示威群众每天都处在武装军警的监视和包围下。最初出发时不过七个人，但是在到达终点杰克逊时增加到了数千人；而出席当天在州议会前举行的反对种族压迫大会的黑人群众达到五万人。在整个进军过程中，示威群众始终斗志昂扬。他们用行动宣告了“非暴力主义”的破产。当种族主义分子开枪寻衅时，部分示威群众立即举枪进行还击。
    美国黑人的斗争是一场你死我活的阶级斗争。在斗争中，黑人越来越多地采用革命暴力的手段，这使美国反动统治集团严重不安。
    黑人群众的高昂斗志在美国一些重要黑人团体最近的人事变动和方针改变上也反映了出来。积极组织南部黑人参加斗争的“大学生非暴力协调委员会”在今年五月间换上了更富有战斗精神、公开强调武装自卫的新领导。这个团体还公开反对政府的侵越政策。另一个黑人团体“种族平等大会”在七月初举行的年会上，正式通过决议，宣布摒弃它二十多年来所一贯遵循的“非暴力主义”，公开主张黑人在受到暴力迫害时有权自卫和进行反击。今年三月才上台的新领导强调说，“非暴力哲学正在完蛋”。
    另外，据报道，美国一些黑人武装自卫组织的力量也在迅速壮大。例如，去年新成立的“进行防御和主持正义执事组织”已经在南部五个州建立起五、六十处分支机构。另一个是总部设在费城的“革命行动运动”组织，它的活动已经扩展到纽约、芝加哥、底特律等北部工业中心。
    美国黑人斗争的历史证明，统治集团的暴力镇压只会更加速广大黑人群众的新觉醒，使更多的人认识到只有起来坚决“以暴力反对暴力”才是唯一的出路。黑人群众武装抗暴斗争的燎原烈火终将烧遍全美国。（附图片）
