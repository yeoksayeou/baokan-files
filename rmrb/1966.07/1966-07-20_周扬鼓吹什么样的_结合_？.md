On October 26, 1965, Zhou Yang gave a summary report to the performers of the musical dance epic "The East Is Red," in which he fiercely attacked Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and art, and shamelessly peddled revisionist goods.

At the beginning of the report, this member of the Black Gang had the audacity to boast that he was a "keen supporter" of "The East Is Red," claiming credit for himself. Then he spread revisionist fallacies, saying, "Combining the past and present, the East and the West, is new; without combination, there is nothing new, and innovation is scarce. Different things combined are new." Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." Our proletarian literature and art are irreconcilable with capitalist and feudal literature and art. Zhou Yang, however, vigorously advocates capitalist and feudal things, striving to preserve old things and prevent their demise. Under the guise of "combination," he actually uses capitalist and revisionist literature and art to dissolve proletarian literature and art, paving the way for capitalist restoration.

Zhou Yang also maliciously said, "It's boring if everyone performs 'The East Is Red.'" What does this mean? This Black Gang member is clearly against us creating works that praise the great Party and praise Mao Zedong Thought. You are afraid that people will grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought, just as an owl fears the sunlight. Let me tell you frankly, the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have clear eyes and minds. They know what to love and what to hate, what to praise and what to oppose, and they will not be deceived by you!

　　周扬鼓吹什么样的“结合”？
　　北京芭蕾舞蹈学校学生　胡秀丽
    一九六五年十月二十六日，周扬给音乐舞蹈史诗《东方红》的演员做总结报告时，大肆攻击毛泽东文艺思想，大肆贩卖修正主义的黑货。
    报告一开始，这个黑帮分子就恬不知耻地吹嘘，说自己是《东方红》的“热心的支持者”，为自己丑表功。接着他又散布修正主义谬论，说什么：“古今中外结合起来，就是新的，不结合就没有新的，创新就少，不同的东西结合起来就是新的。”毛主席早就指出：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。我们无产阶级的文艺，同资本主义、封建主义的文艺是势不两立的。周扬却大肆鼓吹资本主义、封建主义的东西，竭力保持旧事物使它免于死亡。他打着“结合”的幌子，实际是用资本主义、修正主义的文艺来溶化无产阶级的文艺，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。
    周扬还恶毒地说：“都演《东方红》就没意思了。”这是什么话！你这黑帮分明是反对我们创作歌颂伟大的党、歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想的作品。你害怕人们掌握伟大的毛泽东思想，就象夜猫子害怕阳光一样。老实告诉你，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众心明眼亮，他们知道爱什么、恨什么，歌颂什么、反对什么，绝不会上你们的当！
