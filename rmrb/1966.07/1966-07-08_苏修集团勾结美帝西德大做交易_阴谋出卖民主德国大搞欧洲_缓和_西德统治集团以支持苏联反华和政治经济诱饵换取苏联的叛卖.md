The Soviet revisionist leadership group, in collusion with U.S. imperialism in Western Europe, is pushing for détente and reducing U.S. troops in Europe to strengthen its aggression in Vietnam. In this context, the West German militarist revenge group has been active for half a year, eagerly courting the U.S. and the Soviet Union, engaging in political deals with the Soviet Union, and attempting to realize its dream of annexing the German Democratic Republic.

To carry out this conspiracy, the West German ruling group has been working tirelessly for half a year, shifting from its previous stance of "reunifying Germany by force" to waving the olive branch of "peaceful reunification," launching one "peace offensive" after another. They are not hiding their intention to ask the Soviet revisionist leadership group to further betray and hand over the German Democratic Republic to the West German militarist group under the pretext of "Moscow's security interests being satisfied."

In mid-June, during a visit to the United States, the chairman of the Christian Democratic Union parliamentary group in West Germany, Rainer Barzel, delivered a speech that pushed West Germany's "peace offensive" to a new height. In his speech, he proposed a so-called "new suggestion" for "peaceful reunification" of Germany. The content of this suggestion can be summarized as follows: if the Soviet Union agrees to West Germany's annexation of the German Democratic Republic to achieve the so-called "reunification of Germany," West Germany can agree to: (1) allow the Soviet Union to station troops in the "reunified" Germany within the framework of the European security system; (2) significantly increase trade with the Soviet Union; (3) allow the Communist Party of Germany to possibly exist in Germany. Barzel's suggestion exposed the West German ruling group's attempt to use political and economic incentives to exchange for the Soviet Union's betrayal of the German Democratic Republic.

Barzel, in his speech, asked the Soviet Union to consider what is more important: the German Democratic Republic or the stationing of Soviet troops in Germany? He said that the Soviet Union's belief that it must maintain the existence of the German Democratic Republic for its military, economic, and other interests is based on a "wrong premise" and that the Soviet Union's interests can be better guaranteed by other means.

After Barzel's suggestion was put forward, the West German government of Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, while claiming on one hand that it was a "personal suggestion" and that he had not "discussed" it with the West German government leaders beforehand, also said that the suggestion had its "positive aspects," and that the West German government was willing to make "sacrifices" and "concessions" to achieve "reunification." At a meeting of the executive committee of the Christian Democratic Union parliamentary group on June 20, attended by Erhard, a motion of confidence in Barzel was even passed. Other prominent figures in the West German ruling party, such as Franz Josef Strauss, praised Barzel's suggestion as "worthy of praise."

At the same time as Barzel proposed this "new suggestion" in the United States, Erhard and the President of the West German Bundestag, Eugen Gerstenmaier, also extended olive branches to the Soviet Union within West Germany, even expressing a willingness to support the Soviet Union's anti-China stance in exchange for the Soviet Union's betrayal of the German Democratic Republic. Erhard emphasized at a meeting on June 11 that the solution to the German question could not be achieved through talks with the German Democratic Republic, "but only through talks with Moscow," and that "Moscow is the place where we must negotiate the German question." Gerstenmaier went further on June 12, shouting and courting the Soviet Union, saying that as long as the Soviet Union opposed China's so-called "war policy," the Soviet Union could "always count on Germany (West Germany's) support." During this period, Erhard also repeatedly expressed his willingness to visit Moscow and repeatedly expressed his hope that Alexei Kosygin would visit Bonn.

Barzel's suggestion is a continuation and development of the "peace offensive" launched by the West German militarist group this year on the issue of "German reunification." Before this, the West German government had already sent memorandums to the governments of many countries, including the Soviet Union, in March and April, issuing a "white paper" discussing its suggestions and plans for "peaceful reunification" of Germany. These memorandums and "white papers," using "renunciation of the use of force," "international cooperation," and "comprehensive and supervised disarmament on a global scale" as bait, asked the Soviet Union to "seek the reunification of Germany by peaceful means" and to "fairly resolve the German question." They also said that West Germany's diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union should be a means of reaching an understanding on all issues related to reunification.

The West German militarist group's plan to annex the German Democratic Republic not only received the support of U.S. imperialism, which intends to seek détente with the Soviet Union in Western Europe to free up its hands to strengthen aggression in other regions, but also received a response from the Soviet revisionist group.

On May 3, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, in response to West Germany's recent "peace offensive," shouted that the United States would "continue to try to improve relations between the German people and the people in Eastern Europe and peacefully resolve the division of Germany on the principle of self-determination." Secretary of State Dean Rusk, in a speech on May 27, said, "If we can find a lasting solution to this problem in Central Europe, it will not only open the door to stability and security in that region, but also to some very profound possibilities for disarmament." After Barzel put forward his "new suggestion," he also boasted that the reaction to his speech in the United States was "very good" and that "public opinion was unusually interested in it."

On May 17, the Soviet government, in its reply to the West German government's "peace" memorandum, on the one hand, vaguely criticized West Germany, hypocritically saying that the German question should be resolved by the two Germanys, but on the other hand, said that the Soviet Union "advocates the normalization and improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, advocates overcoming the mistrust that has been created in the past." The Bonn government understood the intention of the Soviet reply, believing that the Soviet response was "more realistic than expected" and that the Soviet memorandum contained "interesting starting points." West German Chancellor Erhard said at a press conference on June 10 that the Soviet reply provided the possibility of talks, and that West Germany would continue to take the initiative to improve East-West relations. After Barzel's suggestion was put forward, on June 18, the new Soviet ambassador to West Germany, Mikhail Zharapkin, expressed the hope that relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany would continue to strengthen, and that "friendly relations" between the Soviet Union and West Germany were "a step towards European security and world peace."

The above indicates that the Soviet revisionist group, U.S. imperialism, and the West German militarist group are brewing a major conspiracy to sell out the German Democratic Republic. People of all countries in the world should pay serious attention to this.

    苏修集团勾结美帝西德大做交易  阴谋出卖民主德国大搞欧洲“缓和”
    西德统治集团以支持苏联反华和政治经济诱饵换取苏联的叛卖
    新华社七日讯　本社记者报道：在苏联修正主义领导集团勾结美帝国主义在西欧大搞缓和、美国不断从西欧撤军加强侵越战争的情况下，西德军国主义复仇集团半年来展开了频繁的活动，竭力联美拉苏，同苏联搞政治交易，企图实现它吞并德意志民主共和国的迷梦。
    西德统治集团为了推行这一阴谋，半年来煞费苦心，一改过去“武力重新统一德国”的老调，大摇“和平统一”的橄榄枝，展开一个又一个的“和平攻势”，毫不掩饰地要苏联修正主义领导集团在“莫斯科的安全的利益得到满足”的前提下，进一步实行大叛卖，拱手把德意志民主共和国让给西德军国主义集团。
    西德基督教民主联盟议会党团主席巴泽尔六月中旬访问美国时发表的一篇讲话，把西德的“和平攻势”推到了一个新的高峰。他在讲话中提出了所谓“和平统一”德国的“新建议”。这个建议的内容归纳起来是：如果苏联同意西德吞并德意志民主共和国以实现所谓“德国重新统一”，西德就可以同意：（一）“在欧洲安全体系的范围内”苏联可以在“重新统一”的德国驻留军队；（二）大大增加同苏联的贸易额；（三）允许德国共产党有可能在德国存在。巴泽尔的这个建议，集中地暴露了西德统治集团企图用政治和经济上的甜头，换取苏联出卖德意志民主共和国。
    巴泽尔在讲话中要苏联考虑，究竟是什么更重要？是德意志民主共和国呢，还是在德国驻扎苏军？他说，苏联认为，为了它的军事、经济等方面的利益，必须保持德意志民主共和国的存在，这种想法是“基于错误的前提”，“苏联的利益可以用其他办法得到更好的保证”。
    巴泽尔的这项建议提出后，西德艾哈德政府虽然一方面佯称这是他“个人的建议”，事前未与西德政府领导人“讨论”，但是，又说这个建议“有它积极的一面”，西德政府愿意作出“牺牲”和“让步”来换取“重新统一”。在有艾哈德出席的基督教民主联盟议会党团执行委员会六月二十日举行的一次会议上，还一度通过了对巴泽尔的信任案。西德执政党集团中其他一些头面人物，如施特劳斯等，更把巴泽尔的建议吹嘘成是“应该受到赞扬的”。
    在巴泽尔在美国提出这个“新建议”的同时，艾哈德和西德联邦议会议长格斯登美尔等，在西德国内也向苏联大摇橄榄枝，甚至表示要以支持苏联反华，来换取苏联出卖德意志民主共和国。艾哈德在六月十一日的一次集会上强调，德国问题的解决不能通过同德意志民主共和国举行会谈，“而只有同莫斯科会谈才有可能”，“莫斯科才是我们必须谈判德国问题的地方”。格斯登美尔六月十二日更进一步叫嚷和拉拢苏联说，只要苏联反对中国的所谓“战争政策”，苏联“在任何时候都可以指望得到德国（西德）的支持”。在此期间，艾哈德还多次表示愿意访问莫斯科，并且再三表示希望柯西金访问波恩。
    巴泽尔的建议是西德军国主义集团今年以来就德国“统一问题”展开的“和平攻势”的继续和发展。在这以前，西德政府已先后在三月和四月照会包括苏联在内的许多国家的政府，发表了“白皮书”，大谈它的“和平统一”德国的建议和计划。这些照会和“白皮书”以“放弃使用武力”、“国际合作”、“世界范围的全面而有监督的裁军”等为诱饵，要苏联“用和平手段谋求德国的重新统一”，“公正地解决德国问题”，并且说，西德“同苏联的外交关系，应该是一种就一切与重新统一有关的问题取得谅解的手段”。
    西德军国主义集团吞并德意志民主共和国的计划，不仅受到一意想在西欧同苏联搞缓和，以腾出手来加强在其他地区的侵略活动的美帝国主义的支持，而且也得到苏联修正主义集团的响应。
    五月三日，美国总统约翰逊配合西德最近的“和平攻势”，叫嚷美国要“继续设法增进德国人民和在他们东部的欧洲人之间的关系，并且在自决原则下和平解决德国分裂的问题”。国务卿腊斯克在五月二十七日的一次讲话中表示，“要是我们能为中欧的这个问题找到一个长久的解决办法，那么，不仅能为那个地区的实现稳定和安全开辟道路，而且还能为实现裁军方面的一些很深远的可能性打开门户”。巴泽尔在他的“新建议”提出后，也洋洋自得地说，他在美国发表的讲话反应“非常好”，“舆论对它异乎寻常地感兴趣”。
    苏联政府五月十七日在答复西德政府的“和平”照会中，一方面空洞地指责西德，假惺惺地说什么德国问题要由两个德国来解决，但是又说苏联“主张正常化和改善苏联同德意志联邦共和国的关系，主张跨过过去造成的不信任。”波恩政府对苏联复照的用意是心领神会的，认为苏联的答复比预料的“更实事求是”，苏联的照会包含有“有趣的起点”。西德总理艾哈德在六月十日的记者招待会上说，苏联的复照提供了会谈的可能性，西德将继续为改善东西方关系采取主动。在巴泽尔的建议提出后，六月十八日苏联新任驻西德大使查拉普金表示，希望苏联同西德的关系继续加强，苏联和西德的“友好关系”是“走向欧洲安全和世界和平的一个步骤”。
    上述种种表明，苏联修正主义集团，美帝国主义和西德军国主义集团，正在酝酿合伙搞一个出卖德意志民主共和国的大阴谋。全世界各国人民对此应该给予严重的注意。
