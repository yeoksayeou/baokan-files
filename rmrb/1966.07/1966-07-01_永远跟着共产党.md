	Forever Follow the Communist Party

	The Dai ethnic community member, Kang Langjing, says:
	Look, the ground is covered with blooming flowers; look, the fields are filled with green seedlings. Flowers and seedlings cannot do without sunlight, and we, the people of all ethnic groups, cannot do without the Communist Party. The Party's calls are like sunlight shining everywhere. Under the brilliant sunlight, we are building a new socialist frontier. With the sun, flowers can bloom; with the sun, seedlings can grow. With Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, our lives shine like gems. With the great Mao Zedong Thought, the people of the world can be liberated! Mist can cover the valley, but it cannot block the sun's rays. Imperialism and revisionism speak lies, but they cannot obscure the truth of revolution. The people of the world are awakening and will sweep away all harmful elements! We hail the great Chairman Mao, we hail the great Communist Party; we will always follow Chairman Mao's words, and we will always uphold the revolutionary direction.

    永远跟着共产党
    傣族社员　康朗景看吧，满地的鲜花，看吧，满田的绿秧。鲜花和绿秧离不开阳光，我们各族人民离不开共产党。党的号召象阳光普照，我们在灿烂的阳光下，建设社会主义的新边疆。有了太阳花朵才能开放，有了太阳禾苗才能生长；有了毛主席和共产党，我们的日子才象宝石一样闪光；有了伟大的毛泽东思想啊，世界人民才能得解放！迷雾能盖住山谷，但它遮不住太阳的光芒；帝国主义修正主义满嘴谎言，但它不能把革命的真理遮挡；全世界人民觉醒起来，要把一切害人虫统统扫光！我们欢呼伟大的毛主席，我们欢呼伟大的共产党；我们永远听毛主席的话，永远坚持革命的方向。
