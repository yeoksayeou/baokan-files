    Ghanaian Representative Aima said at the general meeting of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers held today, "Imperialism is unwilling to admit defeat. It will not repent and will not reform. The only way to deal with it is to destroy it."

    Aima said, "This is a critical period in the history of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We must fight for the right to live freely on our own soil, otherwise we will forever be subjected to the oppression and suppression of imperialism. This is a struggle for life and death."

    Aima said, "The Ghanaian delegation strongly opposes the U.S. aggression against Vietnam and other countries, and unconditionally supports all revolutionary struggles against imperialism and old and new colonialism."

    He said, "As Asian and African writers, we have a dual mission in the revolution: to fight with our pens and to fight with our guns. We should expose in our literary works the atrocities committed by imperialism against the oppressed peoples of the world, awaken the consciousness of the oppressed peoples, make them realize the need to fight against imperialism, defeat them, defend national independence, resist the cultural aggression of imperialism and old and new colonialism, and develop our own national culture. We should, through revolutionary works, organize and support and assist the revolutionary peoples of various countries to realize their aspirations."

    Aima finally expressed support for the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers condemning the split conference held in Cairo and supporting the Bureau's decision to declare the splitters illegal.

    加纳代表艾尔马的发言
    新华社三十日讯　加纳代表艾尔马在今天举行的亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，帝国主义是不甘心失败的，它不会悔悟，也不会悔改，对待它只有把它消灭。
    艾尔马说，现在是亚非拉人民历史上关键的时期，我们必须为争取在自己的领土上自由生活的权利而进行斗争，不然就永远屈服于帝国主义的压迫和镇压。这是一场生死的斗争。
    艾尔马说，加纳代表团对美国侵略越南和其他国家表示强烈反对，同时对于反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的一切革命斗争给予无条件支持。
    他说，作为亚非作家来说，我们在革命中担负双重任务：用我们的笔来战斗；用我们的枪来战斗。我们应该在自己的文学作品中揭露帝国主义对全世界被压迫人民干出的暴行，唤起被压迫人民的觉悟，使他们认识到要同帝国主义进行斗争，击败他们，保卫民族独立，反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的文化侵略，发展自己民族文化。我们应该通过革命的作品，组织并支持和支援各国革命人民，使他们实现自己的愿望。
    艾尔马最后表示支持亚非作家常设局谴责开罗召开的分裂会议，支持常设局宣布分裂者为非法的决定。
