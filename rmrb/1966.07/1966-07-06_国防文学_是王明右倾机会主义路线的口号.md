Currently, our country is undergoing an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the leadership of the Party, a large number of proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic workers are actively participating in this great struggle in the ideological realm.

On April 18 of this year, the editorial titled "Hoist the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Actively Participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution" published in the *Liberation Army Daily* pointed out: "In the past decade or so since the founding of the nation, the literary and artistic circles have harbored a black line that is opposed to Mao Zedong Thought and is anti-Party and anti-socialist. This black line is the combination of bourgeois literary thought, modern revisionist literary thought, and so-called literature of the 1930s." To resolutely eliminate this anti-Party and anti-socialist black line and thoroughly cleanse its influence is the primary task of literary and artistic workers in our country at present.

From where did this black line in the literary and artistic circles originate? When did it begin, and who were its representatives? This requires us to start from the so-called "literature of the 1930s," which has been widely praised by some people in recent years.

(I) A Commentary Published to Distort Chinese Revolutionary Literary History and Publicly Hoist a Black Flag of Revisionism in Literature

In the summer of 1936, a debate over two slogans occurred in the left-wing literary movement centered in Shanghai under the Kuomintang's rule. This was the debate between Zhou Yang's "National Defense Literature" slogan and Lu Xun's "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" slogan. This was a major event in the literary front of the 1930s, a reflection of the class struggle in society within the left-wing literary movement, and also a manifestation of the struggle between the correct line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong and the right opportunist line represented by Wang Ming in literary work.

Regarding the two slogans of the 1930s, people, starting from different positions, will inevitably make diametrically opposed judgments. A commentary in the sixth volume of *The Complete Works of Lu Xun*, published by the People's Literature Publishing House in April 1958, made a judgment that completely contradicted historical facts:

This article was first published in the August 1936 issue of the first volume of the fifth issue of *The Writer* monthly.

On August 1, 1935, the Communist Party of China issued a declaration to the Kuomintang government, all parties, and all sectors of the people, proposing to stop the civil war and unite to resist Japan. By December of that year, it further decided on the policy of establishing an anti-Japanese national united front, which was supported by the people nationwide and promoted the anti-Japanese upsurge at that time. In the literary circles, propagating and forming a broad anti-Japanese national united front also became the most central issue at that time; at that time, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the revolutionary literary circles in China, in the spring of 1936, voluntarily dissolved the "Left League" and prepared to establish the "Literary and Artistic Workers' Association." Regarding literary creation, there was a debate over the two slogans of "National Defense Literature" and "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses." In this article and in his June article "Reply to the Trotskyites" and "On Our Literary Movement Today," Lu Xun expressed his attitude and opinions towards the anti-Japanese national united front policy and the literary movement at that time.

Xu Mo-yong wrote that letter to Lu Xun, which was entirely his personal mistake. The Communist Party of China, which was then underground in Shanghai's cultural circles, did not know about it in advance. Lu Xun was then ill, and his reply was drafted by Feng Xue-feng. In this article, he took a sectarian attitude towards some Party member writers who led the "Left League" work at that time and made some accusations that did not conform to the facts. Due to the environmental factors at that time, Lu Xun could not investigate and verify those facts when finalizing the draft.

Now it is known that this commentary was entirely drafted according to Zhou Yang's intentions and was personally revised by him along with Lin Mo-han and Shao Yuan-lin. This commentary, because it came from the hands of such an "authority" as Zhou Yang, had a great influence and was deeply poisonous. Zhou Yang, with his usurped leading position in the literary circles, his evaluation of the two slogans also set a unified tone for China's literary criticism and literary history workers, setting the tone for the advocates of the so-called literature of the 1930s. What is particularly serious is that through this commentary and a series of conspiratorial activities, a black flag of bourgeois opposition to the Party, opposition to socialism, and opposition to Mao Zedong Thought was publicly hoisted in China's literary circles, which is the literary line represented by Zhou Yang.

Due to the influence of this black line of the so-called literature of the 1930s, the modern literary histories and related materials published after the liberation have generally not given a correct evaluation of the two slogans of the 1930s.

After the "tuning" of the commentary in the sixth volume of *The Complete Works of Lu Xun* in 1958, the related books published afterwards all discussed or commented on the two slogans according to the tone of this commentary, completely reversing history. These books say that the "National Defense Literature" slogan is correct, is "Marxist," and is "proposed by the Party"; the "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" slogan is wrong, is "revisionist," and is proposed by some people with ulterior motives (Hu Feng, Feng Xue-feng, etc.) to "split" the literary circles at that time and deceive Lu Xun.

The *Reference Materials for the History of Modern Chinese Literature* compiled by the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China, published in June 1958, states: "In the spring of 1936, before and after the voluntary dissolution of the 'Left League,' based on the call of the Communist Party of China at that time to establish an anti-Japanese national united front, the slogan of 'National Defense Literature' was proposed as the central slogan of the literary united front." "Later, there was a debate over the two slogans of 'National Defense Literature' and 'Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses.' This debate was caused by the conspiracy and provocation of Feng Xue-feng and Hu Feng and others, leading to the split of the revolutionary literary movement."

The book *Revolutionary Literature of the Left League Period*, compiled by the Chinese Department of Nanjing University, published in March 1960, reversed history to an absurd extent. This book says that "National Defense Literature" is "completely in line with the Party's policy of the anti-Japanese national united front, is the actual application of the Party's policy of the anti-Japanese national united front on the literary front." At the same time, it claims that the "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" slogan represents the revisionist line.

The commentary made by Zhou Yang, as well as the modern Chinese literary histories written under the influence of this commentary, completely reversed right and wrong, turning the correct line into the wrong line, the wrong line into the correct line, Marxism into revisionism, and revisionism into Marxism.

The political conspiracy hidden behind this commentary must be thoroughly exposed, and the historical truth that has been distorted and reversed must be restored to its original form.

(II) "National Defense Literature" is a Bourgeois Slogan, a Product of Wang Ming's Right Opportunist Line

The debate over the two slogans of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" and "National Defense Literature" took place at a critical moment in the fate of the Chinese nation, focusing on the issue of establishing an anti-Japanese national united front in the literary circles. In 1931, Japanese imperialism occupied Northeast China, and subsequently, especially after 1935, it further deepened its invasion of China, intensifying its aggression against China. The invasion of Japanese imperialism made the contradictions between Japanese imperialism and the Chinese nation extremely sharp, causing new changes in domestic class relations. Comrade Mao Zedong, based on an analysis of the new situation, formulated the line of both uniting with and struggling against the anti-Japanese national united front.

From June to August 1936, Zhou Yang successively published three articles in *Literary Circles* and *Brightness* magazines: "On National Defense Literature," "Literature of the Present Stage," and "On the Slogan of National Defense Literature with Mr. Mao Dun." In these articles, he expounded his views on the literary united front. He emphasized that "National Defense Literature" is "literature of the entire nation," completely not mentioning the leadership of the proletariat. He said: "The National Defense Literature movement is to call on writers of all classes and factions to stand on the national united front and jointly strive to create artworks related to the national revolution. The theme of national defense should become the most central theme of the works of all writers except traitors."

The actual content of Zhou Yang's proposal of "National Defense Literature" is based on Wang Ming's right opportunist line. In 1935, Wang Ming published "On the Revolutionary Movement in Colonies and Semi-colonies and the Strategy of the Communist Party." This article, from the standpoint of right opportunism, interpreted the anti-imperialist united front, completely denying the leadership of the proletariat, emphasizing the common interests of the entire nation, advocating class fusion, and advocating class capitulationism. Zhou Yang's advocacy is precisely this set of ideas.

Under the pretext of establishing an anti-Japanese national united front, Zhou Yang completely eliminated class struggle. He advocated building a united front, which meant accommodating landlord bureaucrats, compradors, and the bourgeoisie, abandoning proletarian principles; exaggerating the influence and role of bourgeois writers, advocating the abolition of the leading role of proletarian revolutionary literature; believing that the literary united front can be established naturally, and within the united front, only the left can be opposed, not the right. He also distorted the relationship between worldview and creation, denying the guiding role of worldview on creation.

This is a thoroughgoing line of capitulationism, a genuine revisionist literary program.

In response to the class capitulationist errors of the "National Defense Literature" slogan, Lu Xun raised the banner of proletarian revolutionary literature and clearly proposed the slogan of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses." In his article "On Our Literary Movement Today" written on June 10, 1936, he gave a detailed and clear explanation of the meaning of this slogan:

"The Left-Wing Writers' League" has led and fought for five or six years, and it is the movement of proletarian revolutionary literature. This literature and movement have been developing; now it has developed more concretely and more actually into the literature of the national revolutionary war for the masses. The literature of the national revolutionary war for the masses is a development of proletarian revolutionary literature, is the true and broader content of proletarian revolutionary literature at this time. Such literature already exists and will soon, on this basis, be further nurtured by actual fighting life and bloom into splendid flowers. Therefore, the proposal of the new slogan does not mean the cessation of the revolutionary literary movement, or that "this path is blocked." So, it is not a cessation of the long-standing struggle against fascism and all reactionaries, but rather a deepening, expansion, actualization, and more detailed and subtle struggle, concretizing the struggle to the anti-Japanese and anti-traitor struggle, and merging all struggles into the total current of the anti-Japanese and anti-traitor struggle. It is not that revolutionary literature wants to abandon its leadership responsibility, but rather that its responsibility is made heavier and greater, to the point of making the entire nation, regardless of class and party, unite against the outside. This national stance is truly a class stance. Trotsky's Chinese descendants seem to be so confused that they do not even understand this point. But some of my comrades-in-arms are also dreaming the opposite, and I think they are extremely confused.

Lu Xun's slogan is a proletarian slogan, and the line he represents is the proletarian literary line.

When Zhou Yang heard that Lu Xun proposed the slogan of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses," he immediately came out to attack. He believed that Lu Xun's slogan was "obstructing the literary united front," and did not even allow it to exist as an auxiliary slogan to "National Defense Literature." He said: "Outside the slogan of 'National Defense Literature,' it is not allowed for other slogans of the same nature to exist as auxiliary slogans, as long as those slogans do not obstruct the movement of the literary united front. 'Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses' was precisely proposed under the opposite circumstances." He shouted, "There is no need to propose another slogan outside the slogan of 'National Defense Literature,' to be outside the movement of the literary united front." He also labeled Lu Xun with the hat of "sectarianism": "Mr. Lu Xun said that 'Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses' is a development of proletarian revolutionary literature, ... that it cannot become the slogan of the literary united front in the present stage, is self-evident, and the grand words of the 'left' sectarianists should also be suppressed." After that, some of Zhou Yang's followers, such as Xu Mo-yong and Zhang Geng, quickly wrote many articles to "besiege" Lu Xun. A person named Hu Luo declared: "Those who oppose, obstruct, or misinterpret National Defense Literature are our enemies." Another follower of Zhou Yang even attacked Lu Xun's proposal of the slogan "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" as "evil." He said: "Such actions, if coming from the general masses who do not understand the big picture and do not know the people who fight in groups, naturally cannot be answered with curses, saying they are 'shameless'; if coming from those who have always been progressive, then it is better to say it is a kind of evil." And in all the curses of the "National Defense Literature" advocates, the most vicious was the infamous letter written by Xu Mo-yong to Lu Xun on August 1, the same year.

Look, how much hatred Zhou Yang and these people have for the great communist Lu Xun, for the proletarian slogan of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses"! They put themselves in the position of Lu Xun's enemies and launched vicious attacks and slanders against him.

Zhou Yang's crazy "besieging" of Lu Xun ended in a tragic failure, only exposing their revisionist faces. The slogan of "National Defense Literature" proposed by Zhou Yang is the slogan of Wang Ming's right opportunist line. It abandons the proletarian stance, eliminates proletarian leadership, is a thoroughgoing class capitulation, and is a public betrayal of proletarian interests. While Lu Xun, in the struggle, raised the banner of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses," insisted on the correct direction, and was indeed the greatest and bravest flag bearer of China's new cultural movement.

When Zhou Yang and others attacked the slogan of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses," they almost unanimously attacked Lu Xun for not understanding the changed political situation, not understanding the Party's policy of the anti-Japanese national united front in this new situation, and even slandered Lu Xun for "sabotaging the united front." Zhou Yang said: "Those who are suspicious of National Defense Literature are mostly those who do not agree with the national nature of National Defense Literature. They do not see the rapid changes in the relationships between various social strata in times of national crisis, and they do not understand that small-bourgeois intellectuals are reliable allies in the national revolution." "The central error of the opponents of National Defense Literature is that they do not understand the importance of the national revolutionary united front."

In fact, the one who most understood the significance of the Party's anti-Japanese national united front was Lu Xun, and the one who least understood it was Zhou Yang and his small group of enthusiastic followers. The "central error" of the "National Defense Literature" advocates was that they stood on the standpoint of Wang Ming's right opportunist line, distorting the Party's active revolutionary policy in the new situation into a line of class capitulationism. Zhou Yang's articles published at that time, everywhere showed his servile flattery of the bourgeoisie, fearing that Lu Xun's insistence on a clear proletarian stance would scare away bourgeois writers. Zhou Yang said in "On National Defense Literature," if we emphasize "literature of the laboring masses," it is "as if we are narrowing the current base and scope of literature for national salvation, pulling revolutionary literature away from its allies, and making it fall into an absolutely isolated position." He strongly ridiculed those who insisted on the proletarian stance, "If one insists on one's 'purity,' fearing to be contaminated by the 'multi-element chaotic scene,' that is truly 'self-annihilation'!"

The fundamental issue of the united front is the issue of leadership. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Because the current Chinese revolution cannot be separated from the leadership of the Chinese proletariat, the current new culture of China also cannot be separated from the leadership of Chinese proletarian cultural thought, that is, it cannot be separated from the leadership of communist thought." He also specifically pointed out that in the united front, "we must sharply raise the question of who leads whom, and we must resolutely oppose capitulationism." Zhou Yang and others, in executing Wang Ming's right opportunist line, proposed the slogan of "National Defense Literature," precisely abandoning the leading position of the proletariat and eliminating the leadership of communist thought. The three articles Zhou Yang wrote at that time discussing "National Defense Literature" only talked about the united front and the "national" nature of "National Defense Literature," not mentioning the leading role of the proletariat at all. In the articles advocating "National Defense Literature" at that time, some openly proposed: "The 'main body' of the united front is not specific, and the 'leadership' is not monopolized by anyone. The fighters of various factions should share the responsibility of leadership under the common goal." They believed: "The united front, we should regard it as a union under a common belief and common goal, ... there is no such problem: who united whom." "In the literary field, the situation is exactly the same. The question is whether all literary people unite on the anti-Japanese and national salvation front to fight, not which faction or faction unites others." A follower of Zhou Yang even said: "In fact, the current demands of the left-wing writers and the masses are completely consistent, except for anti-Japanese and national salvation, the left-wing writers have no other special demands." All these are not thoroughgoing Wang Ming right opportunist lines, what are they?

Following this line of capitulationism, Zhou Yang and others published a series of absurd theories. Xu Mo-yong said that in the united front, "Proletarians (i.e., proletarians) should not wear obvious badges, not work only with special qualifications to demand leadership, to the point of scaring away comrades of other classes." Which people would be scared away? An article gave an example: "We can say that in this united front, there are also those who do not support the slogan of the national revolutionary war, such as those who strongly advocate anti-enemy and national salvation, the pro-American or pro-British factions, but they do not oppose national defense." Even someone shouted that "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" should be changed to "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Whole Nation." Obviously, these advocates of "National Defense Literature" regarded the pro-American and pro-British factions as "strongly advocating anti-enemy and national salvation," as their "comrades" in "National Defense Literature."

Zhou Yang's accusations against Lu Xun are groundless. The articles Lu Xun wrote during this period show that, unlike Zhou Yang, who adhered to Wang Ming's right opportunist line, he recognized and implemented the Party's united front policy from the standpoint of the proletariat and sincerely supported Comrade Mao Zedong's correct line. In these articles, he once mentioned Comrade Mao Zedong with boundless reverence and expressed an extremely sincere class sentiment towards the Party. He said: "Those who are truly working hard, with their feet firmly on the ground, and fighting for the survival of the Chinese people today, I regard them as comrades, and I am proud of it." Different class writers can unite under the banner of anti-Japanese to resist Japan, but ideologies cannot coexist peacefully. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Communist Party members can build a united front with certain idealists and even religious believers in political action against imperialism and feudalism, but they cannot agree with their idealism or religious doctrines." Lu Xun analyzed the problem in this way at that time: "I think the unity of writers in the anti-Japanese issue is unconditional," "but in literary issues, we can still criticize each other." He said: "I think we should say: writers unite under the banner of 'anti-Japanese,' or under the banner of 'national defense'; we cannot say: writers unite under the slogan of 'National Defense Literature'." This shows that Lu Xun was sober about the inevitable class struggle in the ideological realm.

Zhou Yang, however, insisted that "National Defense Literature" is not only a sign of the relationship between writers but must also be a slogan for creation. He said: "... assuming 'National Defense Literature' is only a banner between writers; it cannot be a slogan for creation, I cannot agree with that. I think the slogan of 'National Defense Literature' should be the indicator of creative activity, it should call on all writers to write works of national defense. If a literary slogan has no relationship with artistic creation, then it will become a meaningless thing." He also advocated: "We can lower the standard of National Defense Literature creation a bit, the important thing is to mobilize everyone to write. ... Regardless of the shortcomings in their consciousness and skills, they should be evaluated highly for the meaning of the theme." Since even the shortcomings in consciousness can be ignored, how can we talk about the proletarian stance? How can we talk about the leadership of communist thought? How can we talk about class struggle in the ideological realm?

To defend his line of capitulationism, Zhou Yang deliberately distorted the relationship between worldview and creation, denying the decisive role of ideological content on artistic works. He said: "If in front of us is a talented author who is also loyal to reality, then, regardless of the class to which he belongs, the faith he holds, and the degree to which he understands the true meaning of the national revolution, he will definitely be able to reflect some important aspects of this revolution in his works. We do not at all belittle the guiding role of the progressive worldview, but the educational significance of reality itself is also not to be ignored." Here, he advocated that proletarian revolutionary writers abandon ideological purity and merge with various anti-communist thoughts.

All revisionists, when talking about the relationship between worldview and creation, always try to blur the boundaries between proletarian thought and bourgeois thought, blur the boundaries between two opposing classes and two worldviews, deny the controlling and guiding role of the writer's stance and worldview on creation. Zhou Yang's advocacy of this fallacy is precisely to oppose proletarian writers from establishing a Marxist-Leninist worldview, to eliminate the guiding role of communist thought, attempting to make our literature deviate from the proletarian cause and become a tool serving the bourgeoisie.

Zhou Yang, who has always adhered to the Wang Ming opportunist line, has long executed a sectarian and exclusionary organizational line in the left-wing literary movement. Their sectarian and exclusionary errors are mainly manifested in using their so-called "National Defense Literature" slogan to unify, excluding proletarian revolutionary writers. Zhou Yang and others' explanations of the "National Defense Literature" slogan, their attacks and slanders against the proletarian slogan of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses," especially their "besieging" of the communist Lu Xun, all showed serious sectarian and exclusionary tendencies. Zhou Yang said that now it is either "National Defense Literature" or "Traitor Literature." He prepared a big hat of "Traitor Literature" to deal with his opponents.

"Thieves shouting 'catch thieves,'" they actually shouted that Lu Xun was "sectarianism" and "exclusionism." This is a shameless slander. In fact, thirty years ago, Lu Xun's struggle against the "National Defense Literature" advocates was absolutely not sectarianism, but insisting on proletarian principles, which was an extremely clear manifestation of proletarian party spirit. The place where Lu Xun was attacked by them was precisely where a proletarian revolutionary should possess high moral qualities. On the contrary, Zhou Yang and these people were unadulterated sectarians. They were "open-doorism" towards the bourgeoisie, following them. On the one hand, they handed over the leadership to the bourgeoisie, and on the other hand, they attacked the great communist Lu Xun with words and pens. They specialized in besieging revolutionaries who implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's correct line.

Against Zhou Yang's deeply rooted sectarianism and exclusionism errors, Lu Xun launched a sharp criticism, especially in his famous "Reply to Xu Mo-yong and on the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front," he stood on the correct position, clearly and deeply criticized and dissected Zhou Yang and Xu Mo-yong's sectarian theory and temperament, pointing out that Zhou Yang's articles published at that time were "basically sectarian," and the Literary and Artistic Workers' Association they controlled still had a "very strong sectarian and guild-like situation," with a tendency of "writer aristocracy."

Zhou Yang's bourgeois literary line in the 1930s, his revisionism and capitulationism in politics, and his sectarianism and exclusionism in organization were all products of Wang Ming's right opportunist line.

(III) From Class Capitulationism to National Capitulationism, "National Defense Literature" Completely Bankrupt

The class capitulationism advocated by Zhou Yang and others around the slogan of "National Defense Literature" is diametrically opposed to Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of the anti-Japanese national united front. The slogan of "National Defense Literature," which betrays proletarian interests, has caused extremely serious consequences in literary practice. At that time, there appeared a large number of pro-capitulationist "National Defense Dramas" and "National Defense Films" written by Xia Yan, Tian Han, and others, as well as many novels with the "whole nation" label. Its poison permeated various fields of literature and art, and even in the "National Defense Songs" that were popular at that time and later, one could see the evil consequences of class capitulationism. In the second part of *The Exile Trilogy*, *Leaving Home*, there is a lyric written like this: "A million glories, in an instant turned to ashes, endless laughter, in a moment turned to desolation! What about yours and mine, what about the poor and the rich? The enemy comes, cannons and guns destroy, in the end, everyone is the same."

The most able to illustrate the bourgeois nature of the "National Defense Literature" slogan is Xia Yan's *Sai Jin Hua*. Xia Yan elevated Sai Jin Hua, a traitor prostitute, to a national hero, losing both class and national stance. This reactionary play was once criticized by Lu Xun and Comrade Ai Siqi, while Zhou Yang and others sealed it as a representative work of "National Defense Drama," praising it as "opening up a new field for national defense drama." Zhou Yang wrote in *Literature of the Present Stage*:

The main themes of history are mostly still in an unexplored state. Since the Opium War, the Chinese nation has had many victorious and failed heroic events, and many national heroes who have never been described by anyone. These rich past themes give the theme of National Defense Literature a historical breadth. National revolution not only has its present and future, but also has its past. We should draw lessons beneficial to the national revolution from the re-evaluation of the past. *Sai Jin Hua* author Xia Yan's continued efforts in this aspect have opened up a new field for national defense drama.

Class capitulationism inevitably degenerates into national capitulationism. Zhou Yang's evaluation of *Sai Jin Hua* is an example.

People will ask: Why did people like Zhou Yang, who had long been known as "left-wing," degenerate into captives of the bourgeoisie, shouting the bourgeois slogan of "National Defense Literature," and raising a black flag against the Party and the people?

In fact, there is nothing strange about this. Everything in society has its own laws of origin and development, and its own historical and class roots. As Lu Xun said: "Before and after the formation of the 'Left League,' some so-called revolutionary writers were actually the scattered descendants of broken households." At that time, in the ranks of left-wing writers, the vast majority entered the revolutionary literary movement with small-bourgeois and bourgeois views, and their worldview was not Marxist, and their standpoint had not shifted to the side of the proletariat. They were bourgeois democrats, and some people did not even pass the test of democratic revolution.

In the 1930s, Zhou Yang and his group around him were firmly executing Wang Ming's opportunist line in politics. In the early period, it was Wang Ming's "left" opportunist line. In the later period, it was Wang Ming's right opportunist line. The slogan of "National Defense Literature" was precisely the reflection of Wang Ming's right opportunist line in the left-wing literary movement. It was an opportunist line in politics, sectarianism in organization, and in literary thought, it was the thought of Russian bourgeois literary critics Belinsky, Dobrolyubov, Chernyshevsky, and the Stanislavsky system in drama. Zhou Yang had long been a believer in nineteenth-century Russian bourgeois democracy, and in the 1930s, he boasted of being a "faithful follower of Chernyshevsky." The systematic bourgeois and revisionist literary thought he represented was precisely the manifestation of revisionist political views and philosophical thought in the field of literature and art.

In the late 1930s, the Chinese revolution underwent a major transformation from domestic revolutionary war to anti-Japanese war. Establishing an anti-Japanese national united front was in line with the changing objective situation of domestic and international class contradictions at that time, and it was the correct Marxist-Leninist policy to promote the Chinese people's revolutionary movement led by the proletariat. Zhou Yang and others, from the standpoint of right opportunism, thought that establishing a united front with the bourgeoisie meant no longer distinguishing between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, not insisting on the independent stance of the proletariat, but rather accommodating and following the bourgeoisie everywhere, turning the proletariat and the Communist Party into the tail of the bourgeoisie and their parties. As Comrade Mao Zedong criticized:

Lowering the Party's stance, blurring the Party's image, sacrificing the interests of workers and peasants to meet the demands of bourgeois reformism, will inevitably lead the revolution to failure.

In this debate, the great communist Lu Xun firmly stood on the side of the correct line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, exposing and criticizing Zhou Yang and some opportunists who practiced class capitulation. He pointed out incisively: "Using pen and tongue to tell everyone about the suffering of becoming a slave of a different race is indeed correct, but one must be very careful not to make everyone draw the conclusion: 'Then, it is better to be a slave of our own people.'" The several articles he published during this period, such as "On Our Literary Movement Today" and "Reply to Xu Mo-yong and on the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front," have important historical significance and have had a great impact on the revolutionary literary movement at that time and later.

Comrade Mao Zedong gave a very high evaluation of the great communist Lu Xun and his outstanding contributions to the revolutionary literary movement: "Lu Xun is the commander of China's cultural revolution. He is not only a great writer but also a great thinker and a great revolutionary. Lu Xun's bones are the hardest, he has not the slightest servility and flattery, which is the most precious character of the people of colonies and semi-colonies. Lu Xun is the one who, on the cultural front, represents the majority of the nation, correctly, bravely, resolutely, loyally, and enthusiastically charges against the enemy in the most correct, bravest, most resolute, most loyal, and most enthusiastic way. The direction of Lu Xun is the direction of the new culture of the Chinese nation."

The debate over the two slogans of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" and "National Defense Literature" was precisely the struggle between two classes and two lines in the 1930s, that is, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat on the literary front for leadership. History has made a conclusion: in the left-wing literary movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the 1930s, Lu Xun represented a proletarian literary line, insisting on Comrade Mao Zedong's correct line, while Zhou Yang represented a bourgeois literary line, insisting on Wang Ming's right opportunist line; "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses" was a proletarian slogan, and "National Defense Literature" was a bourgeois slogan; Lu Xun's banner was the banner of victory, and Zhou Yang's "National Defense Literature" suffered a complete bankruptcy.

(IV) From "National Defense Literature" to "Culture for the Whole Nation" is a Revisionist Black Line

In the rectification movement of 1942, Chairman Mao led the whole Party to resolutely fight against the bourgeois trend of thought that had once prevailed in our Party, and after thoroughly criticizing Wang Ming's political line, military line, and organizational line in theory, he then thoroughly criticized Wang Ming's cultural line in theory. Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" are the most complete, most comprehensive, and most systematic historical summaries of the struggle between the two lines on the cultural front, the inheritance and development of Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory, and the first time in the history of proletarian revolution to propose the most complete, most thorough, and most correct proletarian revolutionary literary line.

People know that many criticisms in "On New Democracy" are aimed at Zhou Yang and others. The criticisms in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" are mainly aimed at Zhou Yang and the bourgeois literary line he represented in the 1930s.

Later facts proved that Zhou Yang and his group, regarding Chairman Mao's criticism of them, were insincere. They were not sincere in their hearts, and on the surface, they made some disguises, but in fact, they were not willing to admit their mistakes, did not want to abandon the black line of the 1930s, and on the contrary, they secretly carried out a series of conspiratorial activities. They deliberately belittled Lu Xun, elevated themselves, distorted history, reversed right and wrong, and claimed to be the representatives of the correct proletarian line. Until today, in Zhou Yang and his followers, the ghost of Wang Ming's opportunist line is not dispersed, and they openly or secretly oppose Mao Zedong Thought, oppose Chairman Mao's literary policy, and oppose the Party's literary line, playing a counter-role to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

As early as January 1940, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that in the new cultural movement since the May Fourth Movement, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, "a completely new cultural vanguard has emerged in China," and "Lu Xun is the greatest and bravest flag bearer of this new cultural army." "The communist Lu Xun," in the "besieging" of the enemy, "has become a great man in the cultural revolution of China." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The direction of Lu Xun is the direction of the new culture of the Chinese nation." Comrade Mao Zedong's high evaluation of Lu Xun undoubtedly affirms the slogan of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses."

However, in eighteen years, in 1958, when the sixth volume of *The Complete Works of Lu Xun* was published, they still wanted to insert their anti-Party private goods into the commentary. The one who inserted this commentary that reversed right and wrong into *The Complete Works of Lu Xun* was Zhou Yang, the initiator of "National Defense Literature," who was also the Zhou Qi-ying criticized by Lu Xun in the letter "Reply to Xu Mo-yong and on the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front."

Thirty years ago, Zhou Yang and these people attacked Lu Xun as a "'left' sectarianist," and now, Zhou Yang and others, with the same tone, again labeled Lu Xun with the hat of "sectarianism." The purpose of these despicable activities is to oppose Comrade Mao Zedong's historical summary of the struggle between the two lines on the literary front, to resist Comrade Mao Zedong's correct criticism of the errors they made in the 1930s, and to attack the communist Lu Xun, attack the proletarian literary line represented by Lu Xun.

Zhou Yang, whenever he had the opportunity, tried to belittle Lu Xun. The commentary in *The Complete Works of Lu Xun* was only a public example. A few years ago, when the wind of individual farming and the wind of rehabilitating counter-revolutionaries blew, that is, when the ghosts and monsters in society took advantage of China's temporary difficulties to come out, Zhou Yang once again directed the attack at the communist Lu Xun. On March 17, 1961, when Zhou Yang talked with the *Lu Xun Biography* film production team, he said: "Lu Xun is not a political activist." "He did not enter the revolutionary vortex." "Emphasize his activities as a writer, literary activities. Revolutionary activities as his internal, spiritual response. Direct connections should be written less. Writing his connection with revolutionary activities too directly, first violates history, second, Lu Xun would be passive and difficult." It can be seen that Zhou Yang has always been opposed to Comrade Mao Zedong's evaluation of Lu Xun.

As early as May 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the fundamental issue of "for whom" in literature had not been solved in the 1930s. "In the past, some of the disputes, disagreements, oppositions, and lack of unity among comrades were not on this fundamental principle issue, but on some relatively minor or even non-principled issues. As for this principle issue, the disputing parties had no disagreement, and they were almost unanimous, all having a certain degree of contempt for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and a tendency to detach from the masses." At that time, with Lu Xun as the representative, some left-wing literary and artistic workers, although they also proposed the slogan of literature serving workers and peasants and workers and peasants themselves creating literature, did not systematically solve the fundamental issue of literature combining with workers and peasants. Among the left-wing literary and artistic workers at that time, the vast majority were still bourgeois democrats, "they stood on the small-bourgeois standpoint, they created their works as the self-expression of the small bourgeoisie, we saw this kind of thing in quite a few literary and artistic works. They often sympathized with the shortcomings of intellectuals of small-bourgeois origin, even advocated them."

However, twenty years later, on November 3, 1962, Zhou Yang said at the *History of Modern Chinese Literature* discussion meeting: "The Left League indeed opened up a new stage for new literature." "New literature began with the limitation of intellectuals, and later gradually expanded to workers and peasants." Before this, in 1957, some core members of Zhou Yang's anti-Party clique, such as Xia Yan, Tian Han, Yang Han-sheng, etc., all unanimously said that as early as the 1930s, they had already "correctly led the literary movement of China," had already established the direction of literary work for workers, peasants, and soldiers, had already solved the problem of literary and artistic workers combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the theatrical troupes at that time had already achieved "revolutionization."

To fundamentally solve the problem of literature serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and literary and artistic workers combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, it is necessary to reform the worldview of literary and artistic workers. Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly pointed out the importance of literary and artistic workers studying Marxism-Leninism and reforming their worldview. He said: "A self-proclaimed Marxist revolutionary writer, especially a Party member writer, must have Marxist-Leninist knowledge." "Observe the world, observe society, observe literature and art with the viewpoint of dialectical materialism and historical materialism."

However, Zhou Yang deliberately opposed Mao Zedong Thought, consistently distorted the relationship between worldview and creation, denied the guiding role of worldview on creation, and belittled the importance of the ideological reform of literary and artistic workers. The fallacies he advocated in the 1930s continued to spread after liberation. In an article Zhou Yang published in 1956, he said: "A talented and loyal-to-reality writer and artist can possibly walk towards an advanced worldview through his own creative path and life practice." On July 28, 1961, at the Beijing Literary and Artistic Work Discussion Meeting, he said: "If the problem of the writer's political stance and worldview is not thoroughly solved, good works cannot be written, ... this puts all problems as worldview problems." On October 10, 1962, at the *Literary Theory* discussion meeting, he said: "If everything is attributed to worldview, worldview will be vulgarized." Zhou Yang also used "imaginary thinking" as a weapon, advocating the "special theory of writers," saying it is the "special law of art." He attempted to use this fallacy to oppose the Party's leadership, oppose Marxist-Leninist scientific epistemology, and oppose the reform of the worldview of bourgeois literary and artistic workers with Mao Zedong Thought.

As early as the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party in 1938, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The Eight-legged Essay must be abolished, the empty and abstract slogans must be sung less, dogmatism must be rested, and in their place, there must be fresh and lively, Chinese style and Chinese spirit that the Chinese people like to hear and see." At the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art held in 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong again pointed out: "From the attic room to the revolutionary base area, it is not only the experience of two regions but also the experience of two historical periods." "The past period has already passed and will not return." These criticisms are directly related to the errors of Zhou Yang and others.

However, Zhou Yang and Tian Han, Xia Yan, Yang Han-sheng (these four people are the "four fellows" criticized by Lu Xun in "Reply to Xu Mo-yong and on the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front") and other representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party do not want to admit this fact. They stubbornly struggle, cling to the "past period" and do not let go. Like all the representatives of the overthrown exploiting classes in history, they are not willing to voluntarily retire from the historical stage. From 1959 to 1962, when a counter-revolutionary current against the Party and socialism surged in society, ghosts and monsters came out one after another, they took the opportunity to blow a black wind of praising the "1930s." They advocated inheriting the so-called "fighting spirit of the 1930s" to replace the revolutionary creation of socialist literature and art today. Tian Han and Yang Han-sheng even arrogantly claimed that they would use their so-called "experience of the 1930s" to "correct our current work."

On September 16, 1957, Zhou Yang said at the expanded meeting of the Party group of the Writers' Association: "The history of the left-wing literary movement is a history that has always been permeated with the struggle between two lines. One is the proletarian line. This line has experienced its immature stage, committed serious errors such as dogmatism and sectarianism, and it was not until the publication of the speech 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' in 1942 that it laid a solid theoretical foundation. The other is the revisionist line, that is, the bourgeois line. This line also waves the banner of Marxism on the surface, but in fact, it opposes Marxism." On February 28, 1958, when Zhou Yang published this speech in the *People's Daily* with the title "A Great Debate on the Literary Front," he changed this passage to:

The struggle between the proletarian line and the bourgeois line in China's literature is long-standing. This is the struggle between the two lines in literature. The proletarian literary line has experienced its immature stage, committed errors such as dogmatism, sectarianism, and other kinds, and it was not until after the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's speech "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in 1942 that it laid a solid theoretical foundation and was completely proven correct in practice.

It is self-evident that in Zhou Yang's view, the representative of this proletarian literary line is himself.

This is a shameful trick. Zhou Yang deliberately reversed right and wrong, attempting to confuse Mao Zedong Thought, which affirms Lu Xun's achievements, with Zhou Yang's fallacies, which completely deny Lu Xun, to confuse Comrade Mao Zedong's correct line with Wang Ming's opportunist line.

Indeed, from the 1930s to the present, the literary circles have long been plagued by an extremely sharp struggle between the two lines. However, the one who "also waves the banner of Marxism on the surface but in fact opposes Marxism" is not someone else, but Zhou Yang. The line he represents is a black line, fundamentally opposed to Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong's speech "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is precisely a pointed criticism of the revisionist literary line represented by Zhou Yang. Zhou Yang attempted to take advantage of this, disguising himself as the representative of the proletarian literary line, openly attacking Lu Xun as representing the revisionist line, the bourgeois line, which is in vain.

In 1962, when it was the twentieth anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," that is, four years after the commentary related to "National Defense Literature" in *The Complete Works of Lu Xun* was published, Zhou Yang once again came out to rehabilitate the slogan of "National Defense Literature." At the *History of Modern Chinese Literature* discussion meeting he convened on November 3 of that year, he said:

Both slogans should be affirmed, both are correct, both have advantages and disadvantages. The slogan of "National Defense Literature" was proposed early and was easy to be accepted by everyone, but it could not express the proletarian stance; the later slogan had "revolution" and "masses," which was good, but some people supported anti-Japanese, saw revolution and masses, and were afraid, in the situation at that time, they should complement and supplement each other. Hu Feng played a role of provocation, and Feng Xue-feng was more responsible. He opposed the slogan of "National Defense Literature" at that time in the name of Lu Xun and the Party Central Committee. Hu Feng and Feng Xue-feng played a role of splitting. At that time, both sides were mixed with sectarian sentiments.

Originally, whether it was during the debate over the two slogans in 1936 or during the fabrication of the commentary on "Reply to Xu Mo-yong and on the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front" in 1958, Zhou Yang was completely denying the slogan of "Literature of the National Revolutionary War for the Masses." Now suddenly changing his tune, saying that "both slogans should be affirmed, both are correct," there is a conspiracy behind it. This is a tactic adopted under pressure of the situation, a cover-up of a thief's guilty conscience, an insincere remark.

Since liberation, Zhou Yang has been like a chameleon, changing his evaluation of "National Defense Literature" with the changing class struggle situation in society, but his black line of revisionist literature has been consistent.

In recent years, Zhou Yang has loudly advocated the so-called "culture for the whole nation" and literature serving the "entire people." In 1959, at the cadres' discussion meeting of the Second Literary and Artistic Performance of the PLA, he said: "What is socialist culture? It is the culture of the whole nation." In the same year, when lecturing at Peking University, he said again, "Our literature and art are for the whole nation." On July 28, 1961, at the Beijing Literary and Artistic Work Discussion Meeting, he said: "All the people of the nation are the service objects. This is different from the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art and is broader than that time." On June 23, 1961, at the National Feature Film Creation Conference, he said: "Some works reflect the interests of the class, and also reflect the interests of the entire people." "Artworks are acceptable to any class, a work produced by a class cannot only be enjoyed by that class, otherwise the work is a failure." In 1962, Zhou Yang, under the pretext of commemorating "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," opposed "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and under the red flag of Mao Zedong's literary thought, opposed Mao Zedong's literary thought. In some of his speeches and written articles, he openly proposed a revisionist literary line of serving the "entire people." Zhou Yang emphasized that "the situation today is different from twenty years ago," and he even said that "our people have successfully completed the 'socialist revolution.'" Therefore, "all the people in the people's democratic united front, with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main body, should be the objects of our literary service and work objects." Zhou Yang's meaning is that Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is outdated, and now literature should serve the whole nation. This is the resurrection of the "National Defense Literature" of the 1930s, a variant of it under today's conditions, and a concentrated manifestation of opposition to Mao Zedong's literary thought.

It is clear that Zhou Yang's advocacy of "culture for the whole nation" is a continuation of his advocacy of "literature of the whole nation" thirty years ago, a product of the same revisionist black line.

Now the truth is clear: the "ancestor" of the literary black line of the 1930s is none other than Zhou Yang.

Xia Yan and Xia Yan once self-proclaimed themselves as the "old man" of the theatrical and film circles of the 1930s, and they were very enthusiastic in advocating the "literature of the 1930s," but the ones who stood behind them and waved the baton were Zhou Yang.

The representative of the revisionist black line, who carried it from the 1930s to the 1960s, was Zhou Yang.

Since liberation, all the bad things in China's literary circles have almost come from Zhou Yang, this "ancestor" of revisionist literature. In the fierce class struggle on the literary front, Zhou Yang has become a big red umbrella that shelters all ghosts and monsters.

Zhou Yang and these representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party have long usurped the leading position in China's literary work, practicing bourgeois dictatorship over proletarian revolutionary literature, preparing conditions for the restoration of capitalism in China.

We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly eliminate the superstition of the so-called literature of the 1930s, thoroughly uproot the black line on the literary front that has been carried down from "National Defense Literature," thoroughly eliminate the influence of Zhou Yang's revisionist black line in literary work, and unswervingly carry out this great proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

### “国防文学”是王明右倾机会主义路线的口号

    “国防文学”是王明右倾机会主义路线的口号
    穆欣
    目前，我国正在掀起一场空前未有的无产阶级文化大革命，广大无产阶级的革命的文艺工作者，正在党的领导下积极参加这场意识形态领域的伟大斗争。
    今年四月十八日，《解放军报》发表的题为《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗积极参加社会主义文化大革命》的社论指出：“建国后的十几年来，文艺界存在着一条与毛泽东思想相对立的反党反社会主义的黑线。这条黑线就是资产阶级的文艺思想、现代修正主义的文艺思想和所谓三十年代文艺的结合。”坚决搞掉这条反党反社会主义的黑线，彻底清除这条黑线的影响，是我国文艺工作者当前的首要任务。
    文艺界的这条黑线是从哪里来的呢？什么时候开始，它的代表人物是谁呢？这需要从最近几年被一些人大肆吹嘘的所谓“三十年代文艺”讲起。
    （一）为了篡改中国革命文学历史、公开竖起一面修正主义文艺黑旗而发表的一条“注释”
    一九三六年夏天，以上海为中心的国民党统治区左翼文艺运动发生过两个口号的争论，这就是周扬同志提出的“国防文学”口号，和鲁迅提出的“民族革命战争的大众文学”口号的争论。这是三十年代文艺战线的重大事件，是当时社会上的阶级斗争在左翼文艺运动内部的反映，也是党内以毛泽东同志为代表的正确路线和以王明为代表的右倾机会主义路线两条路线之间的斗争在文艺工作上的表现。
    对于三十年代这两个口号，人们从不同的立场出发，必然作出迥然不同的论断。一九五八年四月人民文学出版社出版的《鲁迅全集》第六卷，《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》这篇文章的注释，就作了一个完全违背历史事实的论断：
    本篇最初发表于一九三六年八月《作家》月刊第一卷第五期。
    中国共产党于一九三五年八月一日发表宣言，向国民党政府、全国各党各派和各界人民提出了停止内战、一致抗日的主张，到该年十二月更进一步决定了建立抗日民族统一战线的政策，得到全国人民的拥护，促进了当时的抗日高潮。在文艺界，宣传和结成广泛的抗日民族统一战线，也成为那时最中心的问题；当时在中国共产党领导下的革命文学界，于一九三六年春间即自动解散“左联”，筹备成立“文艺家协会”，对于文学创作问题则有关于“国防文学”和“民族革命战争的大众文学”两个口号的论争。鲁迅在本文以及他在六月间发表的《答托洛斯基派的信》和《论现在我们的文学运动》中，表示了他对于抗日民族统一战线政策和当时文学运动的态度和意见。
    徐懋庸给鲁迅写那封信，完全是他个人的错误行动，当时处于地下状态的中国共产党在上海文化界的组织事前并不知道。鲁迅当时在病中，他的答复是冯雪峰执笔拟稿的，他在这篇文章中对于当时领导“左联”工作的一些党员作家采取了宗派主义的态度，做了一些不符合事实的指责。由于当时环境关系，鲁迅在定稿时不可能对那些事实进行调查和对证。
    现在已经知道，这条注释完全是按照周扬的意图拟制的，并且经过他和林默涵、邵荃麟等人一道亲自动手修改。这条注释，因为出自周扬这样的“权威”之手，它的影响甚大，流毒极深。周扬以其在文艺界所窃踞的领导地位，他对两个口号的评价，也就给我国的文学评论和文学史工作者规定了一个统一的口径，为所谓三十年代文艺的鼓吹者定下了基调。特别严重的是，通过这条注释和一系列的阴谋活动，在我国文艺界公开竖起一面反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级黑旗，就是周扬所代表的修正主义的文艺路线。
    由于受到以周扬为代表的“三十年代文艺”这条黑线的影响，解放以来出版的现代文学史和有关史料，对于三十年代这两个口号大都没有作出正确的评价。
    在一九五八年《鲁迅全集》这条注释“定调”以后出版的有关书籍，对于这两个口号的论述或注释，都是按照这条注释的口径下来的，完全颠倒了历史。这些书，说“国防文学”这个口号是正确的，是“马克思主义的”，是“党提出的”；“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个口号是错误的，是“修正主义的”，是一些别有用心的人（胡风、冯雪峰之流），为了“分裂”当时的文艺界，蒙蔽了鲁迅提出来的。
    一九五八年六月出版的中国人民大学新闻系编写的《中国现代文学史参考资料》编注中说：“一九三六年春左联自动解散的前后，根据当时中国共产党关于建立抗日民族统一战线的号召，提出了‘国防文学’作为文艺界统一战线的中心口号。”“后来则有关于‘国防文学’和‘民族革命战争的大众文学’两个口号的论争。这场论争是由冯雪峰和胡风等人的阴谋和挑拨所造成的，引起了革命文艺运动的分裂。”
    一九六○年三月出版的南京大学中文系编写的《左联时期无产阶级革命文学》一书，颠倒历史达到了荒谬绝伦的程度。这本书说，“国防文学”“完全符合党的抗日民族统一战线政策，是党的抗日民族统一战线政策在文艺战线上的实际运用”。同时硬说“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个口号是代表修正主义路线的。
    周扬制造的这条注释，以及在这条注释影响下写的一些中国现代文学史，完全颠倒了黑白，把正确路线说成是错误路线，把错误路线说成是正确路线，把马克思主义说成是修正主义，把修正主义说成是马克思主义。
    对于隐藏在这条注释后面的政治阴谋，必须彻底揭穿，对于被篡改、被颠倒了的历史真实，必须按照它的本来面目颠倒过来。
    （二）“国防文学”是一个资产阶级的口号，是王明右倾机会主义路线的产物
    “民族革命战争的大众文学”和“国防文学”两个口号的争论，是在中华民族生死存亡的关头，围绕着文艺界建立抗日民族统一战线问题展开的。一九三一年，日本帝国主义侵占中国的东北，随后，特别是在一九三五年以后，又步步深入，加紧扩大对中国的侵略。日本帝国主义的入侵，使日本帝国主义同中华民族之间的矛盾极度地尖锐化，使国内的阶级关系有了新的变动。毛泽东同志根据对新形势的分析，制定了又联合又斗争的抗日民族统一战线的路线。
    一九三六年六月到八月间，周扬接连在《文学界》杂志和《光明》杂志上发表《关于国防文学》、《现阶段的文学》、《与茅盾先生论国防文学的口号》等三篇文章，阐述他的文学统一战线的主张。他在这些文章中，打出了所谓“国防文学”的旗号。他强调“国防文学”是“全民族的文学”，根本不提无产阶级的领导权。他说：“国防文学运动就是要号召各种阶层，各种派别的作家都站在民族的统一战线上，为制作与民族革命有关的艺术作品而共同努力。国防的主题应当成为汉奸以外的一切作家的作品之最中心的主题。”①
    周扬提出“国防文学”的实际内容，就是以王明的右倾机会主义路线作为根据的。王明在一九三五年发表了《论殖民地和半殖民地的革命运动与共产党的策略》。这篇文章从右倾机会主义立场解释反帝统一战线，根本否认无产阶级的领导权，强调全民的共同利益，主张阶级溶合，主张阶级投降主义。周扬宣扬的，也正是这一套。
    周扬借口建立抗日民族统一战线，完全取消阶级斗争。他宣传要建立统一战线，就要迎合地主官僚买办和资产阶级，放弃无产阶级的原则；夸大资产阶级作家的影响和作用，主张取消无产阶级革命文学的领导作用；认为文艺统一战线可以自然而然地建立，在统一战线内部只能反左，不能反右。他还歪曲世界观与创作的关系，否认世界观对创作的指导作用。
    这是一条彻头彻尾的投降主义的路线，这是一个货真价实的修正主义的文艺纲领。
    针对“国防文学”这个口号的阶级投降主义错误，鲁迅高举无产阶级革命文学的旗帜，明确地提出“民族革命战争的大众文学”的口号。他在一九三六年六月十日写的《论现在我们的文学运动》中，对这个口号的含义作了详细、明确的说明：
    “左翼作家联盟”五六年来领导和战斗过来的，是无产阶级革命文学的运动。这文学和运动，一直发展着；到现在更具体底地，更实际斗争底地发展到民族革命战争的大众文学。民族革命战争的大众文学，是无产阶级革命文学的一发展，是无产革命文学在现在时候的真实的更广大的内容。这种文学，现在已经存在着，并且即将在这基础之上，再受着实际战斗生活的培养，开起烂缦的花来罢。因此，新的口号的提出，不能看作革命文学运动的停止，或者说“此路不通”了。所以，决非停止了历来的反对法西主义，反对一切反动者的血的斗争，而是将这斗争更深入，更扩大，更实际，更细微曲折，将斗争具体化到抗日反汉奸的斗争，将一切斗争汇合到抗日反汉奸斗争这总流里去。决非革命文学要放弃它的阶级的领导的责任，而是将它的责任更加重，更放大，重到和大到要使全民族，不分阶级和党派，一致去对外。这个民族的立场，才真是阶级的立场。托洛斯基的中国的徒孙们，似乎胡涂到连这一点都不懂的。但有些我的战友，竟也有在作相反的“美梦”者，我想，也是极胡涂的昏虫。
    鲁迅提出的口号，是无产阶级的口号，他所代表的路线，是无产阶级的文艺路线。
    周扬听到鲁迅提出“民族革命战争的大众文学”的口号，立即亲自出来攻击。他认为鲁迅提出的这个口号，是“妨碍文学上统一战线的”，连作为“国防文学”的辅助口号，都不允许存在。他说：“在‘国防文学’的口号之外，不是不能容许别的同类性质的口号的辅助的存在，只要那口号不妨碍文学上统一战线的运动。‘民族革命战争的大众文学’就恰恰是在相反的情形之下提出来的”。他叫嚷“不必在‘国防文学’的口号之外另提别的口号，自外于文学上的统一战线的运动。”他还给鲁迅扣上“宗派主义”的帽子：“鲁迅先生说‘民族革命战争的大众文学’是无产革命文学在现在的一个发展，……那它不能成为现阶段文学上统一战线的口号，是自明的了，‘左’的宗派主义者的大言壮语也应该可以迹敛了。”在这以后，周扬的一些追随者，如徐懋庸、张庚等人，紧跟着写了许多文章来“围剿”鲁迅。一个叫胡洛的人宣称：“凡反对，阻碍或曲解国防文学的都是我们的敌人”。②周扬的另一个追随者竟然攻击鲁迅提出“民族革命战争的大众文学”的口号是“罪恶”。他说：“这种行动，如果出之于一般不了解大势的群众，不懂得集团的战斗的人们，那自然不能只用骂声去回答，说他们是‘无耻’；如果出之于素来以前进自居的人们，那就毋宁说是一种罪恶”。③而在所有“国防文学”论者的咒骂中，最恶毒的则是同年八月一日徐懋庸写给鲁迅的那封臭名远扬的信。
    请看，周扬这些人对于伟大的共产主义者鲁迅，对于“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个无产阶级的口号，是多么仇恨！他们把自己放在鲁迅的敌人的位置上，对鲁迅进行恶毒的攻击和诬蔑。
    周扬这些人对鲁迅的疯狂“围剿”，以悲惨的失败而告终，徒然暴露自己修正主义的嘴脸。周扬提出的
  “国防文学”这个口号，是王明右倾机会主义的口号。它放弃无产阶级立场，取消无产阶级领导，是彻底的阶级投降，是对无产阶级利益的公开背叛。而鲁迅在斗争中高举“民族革命战争的大众文学”的旗帜，坚持正确的方向，他不愧是中国新文化运动的“最伟大和最英勇的旗手”。
    周扬等人攻击“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个口号的时候，几乎众口一辞地攻击鲁迅“不理解”已经变化了的政治形势，“不理解”党在这种新形势下面所采取的抗日民族统一战线政策，甚至诬陷鲁迅“破坏统一战线”。周扬说：“对于国防文学抱着怀疑的人大都是不同意于国防文学的这个全民族的性质。他们看不见在民族危难中各社会层的相互之间的关系的急遽的转换，也不了解小资产阶级知识分子是民族革命中可靠的同盟者。”“国防文学的反对论者的错误的中心就是不了解民族革命统一战线的重要意义。”
    其实，最了解党的抗日民族统一战线意义的是鲁迅，最不了解的则是周扬和他的一小撮狂热的追随者。“国防文学”论者的“错误的中心”，就是他们站在王明右倾机会主义的立场上，把党在新形势下提出的积极的革命政策曲解为阶级投降主义的路线。周扬当时所发表的文章，处处表现出对资产阶级卑躬屈膝的迎合，唯恐鲁迅坚持鲜明的无产阶级立场吓跑了资产阶级作家。周扬在《关于国防文学》中说，如果强调“勤劳大众的文学”，“无异于缩小目前救亡文学的基础和范围，把革命文学从它的友军拉开，使它陷于绝对孤立的地位。”他极力讥讽坚持无产阶级立场的人，“如果固守着自己的‘纯洁’，怕沾染了‘多元的混乱场面’，那才真是‘自己取消’！”
    统一战线的根本问题是领导权问题。毛泽东同志教导我们：“由于现时中国革命不能离开中国无产阶级的领导，因而现时的中国新文化也不能离开中国无产阶级文化思想的领导，即不能离开共产主义思想的领导。”④他还特别指出，在统一战线中，“必须尖锐地提出谁领导谁的问题，必须坚决地反对投降主义。”⑤周扬等人执行王明右倾机会主义路线，提出的“国防文学”口号，正是放弃无产阶级的领导地位，取消共产主义思想的领导。周扬当时写的三篇论述“国防文学”的文章，只讲统一战线和“国防文学”的“全民族”的性质，丝毫不提无产阶级的领导作用。当时鼓吹“国防文学”的文章里面，有的公然提出：“统一战线的‘主体’并不是特定的，‘领导权’并不是谁所专有的。各派的斗士，应该在共同的目标下，共同负起领导的责任来。”⑥他们认为：“统一战线，我们应当看做是在一种共同的信念，共同的目标之下的联合，……这里没有这样的问题：谁统一了谁。”“在文学方面，情形也完全一样。问题是一切文学者是不是都到抗日救亡的战线上联合起来斗争，而不是由那一派那一派去统一人家。”⑦一个周扬的追随者甚至讲：“在事实上说，目前左翼作家与民众的要求是完全一致的，除了抗日救亡以外，左翼作家也并无其他的特殊要求”。⑧所有这些，不是彻头彻尾的王明右倾机会主义路线，是什么呢？
    沿着这条投降主义的路线往下滑，周扬等人发表了一系列的奇谈怪论。徐懋庸说，在统一战线中“普洛（按：即无产阶级）不应该挂起明显的徽章，不以工作，只以特殊的资格去要求领导权，以至吓跑别的阶层的战友。”会吓跑哪些人呢？有篇文章举例：“我们很可以说在这个统一战线之中亦有不赞成民族革命战争这个口号的，例如竭力主张抗敌救国的亲美派或亲英派，但他们并不反对国防”。⑨甚至有人叫嚣，应当把“民族革命战争的大众文学”“改为‘民族革命战争的全民文学’”。⑩很明显，这些“国防文学”的鼓吹者，把亲美派、亲英派也看作是“竭力主张抗敌救国的”，也是他们的“国防文学”的“战友”。
    周扬对于鲁迅的指责，是毫无根据的。鲁迅这个时期写的一些文章表明，同奉行王明右倾机会主义路线的周扬相反，他是从无产阶级的立场来认识和实行党的统一战线政策的，他衷心地拥护毛泽东同志的正确路线。他在这些文章里面，曾以无限崇敬的心情提到毛泽东同志，对党流露出异常真挚的阶级感情。他说：“那切切实实，足踏在地上，为着现在中国人的生存而流血奋斗者，我得引为同志，是自以为光荣的。”?
    不同阶级的作家，可以在抗日的旗帜下联合抗日，但是意识形态却是不能和平共处的。正如毛泽东同志指出的：“共产党员可以和某些唯心论者甚至宗教徒建立在政治行动上的反帝反封建的统一战线，但是决不能赞同他们的唯心论或宗教教义。”?鲁迅当时正是这样分析问题的：“我以为文艺家在抗日问题上的联合是无条件的”，“但在文学问题上我们仍可以互相批判。”他说：“我以为应当说：作家在‘抗日’的旗帜，或者在‘国防’的旗帜之下联合起来；不能说：作家在‘国防文学’的口号下联合起来”。?这表明鲁迅对于意识形态领域不可避免的阶级斗争是清醒的。
    周扬却坚持说：“国防文学”不但是作家关系的标志，还必须作为创作的口号。他说：“……以为‘国防文学’只是作家间的标帜；而不能作为创作的口号，这我就不能同意了。我以为‘国防文学’的口号应当是创作活动的指标，它要号召一切作家都来写国防的作品。一个文学的口号如果和艺术的创作活动不生关系，那它就要成为毫无意义的东西。”他还主张：“不妨把国防文学创作的标准放低一些，重要的是动员大家都去写。……不管他们意识上和技巧上的缺点，应当以那主题的意义而得到较高的评价。”既然连意识上的“缺点”都可以不管，还谈得上什么无产阶级的立场呢？还谈得上什么共产主义思想的领导呢？还谈得上什么意识形态领域的阶级斗争呢？
    为了替自己的投降主义路线辩护，周扬故意歪曲世界观与创作的关系，否定思想内容对于艺术作品的决定作用。他说：“假使在我们面前的，是一个有才能的作者又忠于现实的话，那末，不管他所属的阶层，所抱的信仰，以及他对于民族革命之真义的理解的程度，他一定能够在他的作品里面反映出这个革命的某些重要的方面来。我们丝毫不看轻进步的世界观的烛照的作用，但现实本身的教育的意义，却也是不能忽视的。”他在这里鼓吹无产阶级革命作家抛弃意识形态上的纯洁，去同形形色色的反共思想“溶合”。
    一切修正主义者在谈到世界观和创作关系的时候，总是竭力模糊无产阶级思想同资产阶级思想的界限，模糊相对立的两个阶级、两种世界观的界限，否认作家的立场、世界观对创作的支配和指导作用。周扬宣扬这种谬论的目的，就是要反对无产阶级作家建立马克思列宁主义的世界观，取消共产主义思想的指导作用，企图使我们的文学脱离无产阶级事业，变成为资产阶级服务的工具。
    一贯奉行王明机会主义路线的周扬，长期在左翼文艺运动中执行了一条宗派主义、关门主义的组织路线。他们的宗派主义、关门主义错误，主要表现在用他们的所谓“国防文学”的口号去统一，排斥无产阶级的革命作家。周扬等人关于“国防文学”口号的解释，对于“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个无产阶级口号的攻击和诬蔑，特别是他们对于共产主义者鲁迅的“围剿”，都表现了严重的宗派主义、关门主义倾向。周扬说道，现在不是“国防文学”就是“汉奸文学”。他准备了一顶“汉奸文学”的大帽子来对付自己的反对者。
    “贼喊捉贼”，他们居然口口声声攻击鲁迅是“关门主义”“宗派主义”。这是无耻的诬蔑。实际上，三十年前鲁迅对“国防文学”论者的斗争，绝对不是什么宗派主义，而是坚持无产阶级的原则，这是无产阶级党性的极其鲜明的表现。鲁迅遭到他们攻击的地方，恰好是一个无产阶级革命家身上应当具备的高尚的品德。相反的，周扬这些人倒是不折不扣的宗派主义。他们对于资产阶级，倒是“开门主义”，跟在他们屁股后面跑。他们一方面，对资产阶级，把领导权拱手相让，另一方面，对伟大的共产主义者鲁迅，却口诛笔伐。他们专以围攻执行毛泽东同志正确路线的革命家为能事。
    对于周扬这种根深蒂固的关门主义和宗派主义错误，鲁迅进行了尖锐的批判，特别是他那篇著名的《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》，站在正确的立场上，明确地深刻地指责了和解剖了周扬、徐懋庸们的宗派主义的理论与气质，指出周扬当时发表的文章
  “是基本上宗派主义的”，他们把持的文艺家协会“还非常浓厚的含有宗派主义和行帮情形”，有“‘作家阀’的倾向”。
    周扬在三十年代所执行的资产阶级文艺路线，他在政治上的修正主义、投降主义，组织上的宗派主义、关门主义，都是王明右倾机会主义路线的产物。
    （三）从阶级投降主义到民族投降主义，“国防文学”彻底破产
    周扬等人围绕“国防文学”这个口号所宣扬的阶级投降主义，是同毛泽东同志的抗日民族统一战线思想背道而驰的。“国防文学”这个背叛无产阶级利益的口号，在文艺实践中造成了极其严重的后果。当时曾出现了夏衍、田汉等人写的大批宣扬投降主义的“国防戏剧”、“国防电影”，以及许多“全民”牌号的小说。它的毒素渗透到文学艺术的各个领域，就在当时和后来流行的“国防歌曲”中，也能看到这种阶级投降主义的恶果。在《流亡三部曲》第二部《离家》里，有段歌词就是这样写的：“百万荣华，一刹化为灰烬，无限欢笑，转眼变成凄凉！说什么你的我的，分什么穷的富的？敌人杀来，炮毁枪伤，到头来都是一样。”
    最能够说明“国防文学”口号的资产阶级本质的，是夏衍所写的《赛金花》。夏衍把赛金花这个汉奸妓女捧成民族英雄，既丧失阶级立场，又丧失民族立场。这个反动剧本，当时曾经遭到鲁迅和艾思奇同志的抨击，而周扬等人却把它封为“国防戏剧”的代表作，吹捧是“给国防剧作开辟了一个新的园地”。周扬在《现阶段的文学》中写道：
    历史的主题大部分都还在未经掘发的状况里。鸦片战争以来，中国民族有多少胜利的和失败的英雄事件，有多少从不曾被人描写的民族英雄。这些丰富的过去的题材使国防文学的主题有了一种历史的阔度。民族革命不但有它的现在，将来，同时也有它的过去，我们要从过去的再评价里引出于民族革命有益的教训。《赛金花》作者夏衍在这一方面的继续的努力给国防剧作开辟了一个新的园地。
    阶级投降主义，必然要堕落为民族投降主义。周扬对《赛金花》的评价，就是一个例证。
    人们会问：为什么象周扬这样一些素以“左翼”相标榜的作家，却堕落成为资产阶级的俘虏，喊出“国防文学”这个资产阶级口号，打起一面反党反人民的黑旗呢？
    其实，这也没有什么奇怪。社会上的任何事物都有自己产生和发展的规律，都有自己的历史的阶级的根源。正象鲁迅讲的：“在左联结成的前后，有些所谓革命作家，其实是破落户的漂零子弟。”在当时左翼作家的队伍里面，绝大多数人是带着小资产阶级、资产阶级观点进入革命文艺运动的，他们的世界观还不是马克思主义的，立足点还没有转到无产阶级这边来。他们是资产阶级民主主义者，有些人连民主革命这一关就没有过去。
    三十年代周扬和他周围的一伙，在政治上是坚决执行王明机会主义路线的。在前期，是王明的“左”倾机会主义路线。在后期，是王明的右倾机会主义路线。“国防文学”这个口号，正是王明的右倾机会主义路线在左翼文艺运动中的反映。它在政治上是机会主义路线，组织上是宗派主义，文艺思想上是俄国资产阶级文艺评论家别林斯基、杜勃罗留波夫、车尔尼雪夫斯基的思想，以及戏剧方面的斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系。周扬一直是十九世纪俄国资产阶级民主主义的信徒，他在三十年代就标榜自己是“车尔尼雪夫斯基的忠实信奉者”。他所代表的一套系统的资产阶级、修正主义的文艺思想，正是修正主义的政治观点和哲学思想在文学艺术领域的表现。
    三十年代后期，中国革命遇到从国内革命战争转入抗日战争这样一个重大的转变。建立抗日民族统一战线是适应于当时国内外阶级矛盾变化的客观形势，为了推进以无产阶级为领导的中国人民革命运动的正确的马克思列宁主义政策。周扬等人从右倾机会主义的立场出发，以为同资产阶级建立统一战线，就是不要再区分资产阶级和无产阶级，不要坚持无产阶级的独立立场，就是要处处迁就和顺应资产阶级，把无产阶级和共产党变成资产阶级及其政党的尾巴。正象毛泽东同志所批评的：
    降低党的立场，模糊党的面目，牺牲工农利益去适合资产阶级改良主义的要求，将必然引导革命趋于失败。?
    在这场争论中，伟大的共产主义者鲁迅，坚定地站在以毛泽东同志为代表的正确路线方面，揭露和批评周扬等一些实行阶级投降的机会主义者。他一针见血地指出：“用笔和舌，将沦为异族的奴隶之苦告诉大家，自然是不错的，但要十分小心，不可使大家得着这样的结论：‘那么，到底还不如我们似的做自己人的奴隶好’。”?他在这个时期发表的《论现在我们的文学运动》、《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》等几篇文章，具有重要的历史意义，实际上成为这场争论的结论，对于当时和以后的革命文艺运动产生了巨大的影响。
    毛泽东同志对于伟大的共产主义者鲁迅，对于他在革命文艺运动中的杰出贡献，给予极高的评价：“鲁迅是中国文化革命的主将，他不但是伟大的文学家，而且是伟大的思想家和伟大的革命家。鲁迅的骨头是最硬的，他没有丝毫的奴颜和媚骨，这是殖民地半殖民地人民最可宝贵的性格。鲁迅是在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄。鲁迅的方向，就是中华民族新文化的方向。”?
    “民族革命战争的大众文学”和“国防文学”两个口号的争论，正是三十年代两个阶级、两条路线的斗争，也就是资产阶级同无产阶级在文艺战线上争夺领导权的斗争。历史已经作出结论：在三十年代国民党统治区域的左翼文艺运动中，鲁迅所代表的是一条无产阶级的文艺路线，坚持毛泽东同志的正确路线，周扬所代表的是一条资产阶级的文艺路线，坚持王明的右倾机会主义路线；“民族革命战争的大众文学”是一个无产阶级的口号，“国防文学”是一个资产阶级的口号；鲁迅的旗帜是胜利的旗帜，周扬的“国防文学”遭到了彻底破产。
    （四）从“国防文学”到“全民的文化”是一条修正主义的黑线
    一九四二年的整风运动中，毛主席领导全党对于王明路线这个曾在我们党内泛滥过的资产阶级的思潮进行了坚决的斗争，在理论上彻底地批判了王明的政治路线、军事路线和组织路线之后，接着又从理论上彻底地批判了王明的文化路线。毛主席的《新民主主义论》和《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，就是对文化战线上的两条路线斗争的最完整、最全面、最系统的历史总结，是马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论的继承和发展，在无产阶级革命历史上第一次提出了最完整、最彻底、最正确的无产阶级的革命文艺路线。
    人们知道，《新民主主义论》里的许多批评，都是针对周扬等人的。《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》里的批评，更是主要针对周扬和他所代表的三十年代资产阶级文艺路线的。
    后来的事实证明，周扬及其一伙，对于毛泽东同志对他们的批评，阳奉阴违。他们心里不服，在表面上做了一些伪装，实际上不仅不肯承认错误，不愿抛弃三十年代这条黑线，相反地，他们背着党中央，进行了一系列的阴谋活动。他们极力贬低鲁迅，抬高自己，歪曲历史，颠倒是非，把自己说成是无产阶级正确路线的代表者。直到今天，在周扬和他的那些追随者中间，王明机会主义路线的阴魂不散，他们或明或暗地反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的文艺方针，反对党的文艺路线，同党中央、毛主席唱对台戏。
    早在一九四○年一月，毛泽东同志讲到，在“五四”以来的新文化运动中，在中国共产党领导下，“中国产生了完全崭新的文化生力军”，“而鲁迅，就是这个文化新军的最伟大和最英勇的旗手。”“共产主义者的鲁迅”，在敌人的“围剿”中“成了中国文化革命的伟人。”毛泽东同志说：“鲁迅的方向，就是中华民族新文化的方向。”毛泽东同志对于鲁迅的崇高评价，毫无疑问是肯定“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个口号的。
    可是，在十八年以后，到了一九五八年，《鲁迅全集》第六卷出版的时候，他们还要在注释中塞进他们反党的私货。把这条颠倒是非的注释塞进《鲁迅全集》的，正是“国防文学”的倡导人周扬，也就是鲁迅在《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》这封信里痛斥的那个周起应。
    三十年前，周扬这些人攻击鲁迅是“‘左’的宗派主义者”，现在，周扬等人用同一的腔调，又给鲁迅扣上“宗派主义”的帽子。他们这些卑劣的活动的目的，就是反对毛泽东同志对文艺战线上两条路线斗争的历史总结，就是要抵制毛泽东同志对于他们在三十年代所犯错误的正确批评，就是攻击共产主义者鲁迅，攻击鲁迅代表的无产阶级文艺路线。
    周扬一有机会，就极力贬低鲁迅。《鲁迅全集》的注释，只不过是一个公开的例证。前几年，刮起单干风、翻案风的时候，也就是社会上牛鬼蛇神乘着我国遭受暂时困难纷纷出笼的时候，周扬再一次把攻击矛头指向共产主义者鲁迅。一九六一年三月十七日，周扬和《鲁迅传》电影摄制组谈话的时候曾说：“鲁迅究竟不是政治活动家。”“他没有投入革命漩涡的中心。”“还是着重写他作家的活动、文学的活动。革命活动作为他内在的、精神上的呼应。直接的联系少写一些。把他和革命活动的联系写得太直接了，第一违背历史，第二鲁迅就被动、难了。”可见周扬对毛泽东同志关于鲁迅的评价一直是对抗的。
    早在一九四二年五月，毛泽东同志指出，文艺“为什么人”这个根本的问题，在三十年代并没有解决。“过去有些同志间的争论、分歧、对立和不团结，并不是在这个根本的原则的问题上，而是在一些比较次要的甚至是无原则的问题上。而对于这个原则问题，争论的双方倒是没有什么分歧，倒是几乎一致的，都有某种程度的轻视工农兵、脱离群众的倾向。”?那个时候，以鲁迅为代表的一些左翼文艺工作者，虽然也提出了文艺要为工农服务和工农自己创作文艺的口号，但是并没有系统地解决文艺同工农相结合这个根本问题。在当时的左翼文艺工作者中间，绝大多数还是资产阶级民主主义者，“他们是站在小资产阶级立场，他们是把自己的作品当作小资产阶级的自我表现来创作的，我们在相当多的文学艺术作品中看见这种东西。他们在许多时候，对于小资产阶级出身的知识分子寄予满腔的同情，连他们的缺点也给以同情甚至鼓吹。”?
    可是，二十年以后，一九六二年十一月三日，周扬却在《中国现代文学史》讨论会上说：“左联的确为新文学开辟了一个新阶段。”“新文学开始的时候，局限于知识分子，后来逐渐扩大到工农。”在这以前，一九五七年，周扬这个反党集团的一些核心人物，如象夏衍、田汉、阳翰笙等都异口同声地说，早在三十年代，他们就已经“正确地领导了中国的文艺运动”，就已经确立了文艺工作的工农兵方向，就已经解决了文艺工作者同工农兵相结合的问题，那个时候的戏剧团体就已经实现了“革命化”。
    要想从根本上解决文艺为工农兵服务、文艺工作者与工农兵相结合的问题，必须改造文艺工作者的世界观。毛泽东同志多次指出文艺工作者学习马克思列宁主义和改造世界观的重要性。他说：“一个自命为马克思主义的革命作家，尤其是党员作家，必须有马克思列宁主义的知识。”“用辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的观点去观察世界，观察社会，观察文学艺术”。?
    可是，周扬故意与毛泽东思想相对抗，一贯地歪曲世界观与创作的关系，否认世界观对创作的指导作用，抹煞文艺工作者思想改造的重要性。他在三十年代极力宣扬的这些谬论，解放以后还在继续散播。周扬一九五六年发表的一篇文章中说：“有才能的、忠实于现实的作家、艺术家有可能通过自己的创作道路和生活实践走向先进的世界观”。?一九六一年七月二十八日，他在北京文艺工作座谈会上说：“认为作家的政治立场世界观的问题不彻底解决，就一定写不出好作品，……这就把一切问题都当作世界观问题了。”一九六二年十月十日，他在《文学概论》讨论会上说：“把一切都归之世界观，就把世界观庸俗化了。”周扬还拿“形象思维”作武器，宣扬“作家特殊论”，把它说成是“艺术的特殊规律”。企图利用这种谬论反对党的领导，反对马克思列宁主义的科学认识论，反对用毛泽东思想改造资产阶级文艺家的世界观。
    早在一九三八年党的六届六中全会上，毛泽东同志就曾指出：“洋八股必须废止，空洞抽象的调头必须少唱，教条主义必须休息，而代之以新鲜活泼的、为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的中国作风和中国气派。”在一九四二年举行的延安文艺座谈会上，毛泽东同志又曾指出：“从亭子间到革命根据地，不但是经历了两种地区，而且是经历了两个历史时代。”“过去的时代，已经一去不复返了。”?这些批评都是和周扬等人的错误直接关联的。
    可是，周扬和田汉、夏衍、阳翰笙（按：这四个人，就是当年鲁迅在《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》中所痛斥的“四条汉子”）这些钻到党内来的资产阶级代表人物，不愿承认这种事实，他们顽强的挣扎，死抱住“过去的时代”不放。他们如同历史上所有被推翻的那些剥削阶级代表人物一样，绝不甘心自动退出历史舞台。一九五九年到一九六二年，当着社会上一股反党反社会主义的逆流泛滥起来，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼的时候，他们乘机刮起一阵吹捧“三十年代”的黑风。他们鼓吹要继承所谓“三十年代的战斗作风”，用以代替当今社会主义文学艺术的革命创造。田汉、阳翰笙等人甚至狂妄地宣称，要以他们所谓“三十年代”的经验“来改正我们当前的工作。”
    一九五七年九月十六日，周扬在作家协会党组扩大会议上说道：“左翼文学运动的历史就是一部始终贯穿着两条路线斗争的历史。一条是无产阶级的路线。这条路线曾经经历过它的幼稚阶段，犯过教条主义、宗派主义等等严重的错误，到一九四二年《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表，才奠定了坚固的理论基础。另一条是修正主义路线，也就是资产阶级路线。这条路线表面上也打着马克思主义的招牌，但实际上是反对马克思主义的。”一九五八年二月二十八日，周扬将这个讲话加上《文艺战线上的一场大辩论》这个题目在《人民日报》发表的时候，把这段话改成：
    我国文艺上的无产阶级路线和资产阶级路线的斗争是由来已久的。这是文艺上两条路线的斗争。无产阶级的文艺路线曾经经历了它的幼稚的阶段，犯过教条主义、宗派主义及其它各种错误，到一九四二年毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表后，才奠定了坚固的理论基础，并且在实践中完全证明了这条路线的正确。
    不言而喻，在周扬看来，这条无产阶级文艺路线的代表者就是他自己。
    这是一个可耻的骗局。周扬故意颠倒黑白，妄图把肯定鲁迅功绩的毛泽东思想和全面否定鲁迅的周扬的谬论混淆起来，把毛泽东同志的正确路线同王明的机会主义路线混淆起来。
    不错，从三十年代到现在，文艺界确实是长期存在着极其尖锐的两条路线的斗争。可是，一直在“表面上也打着马克思主义的招牌，但实际上是反马克思主义的”，不是别人，正是周扬。他所代表的那一条路线，是一条黑线，是同毛泽东思想根本对立的。毛泽东同志的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，正是针锋相对地批判了周扬所代表的那一条王明机会主义的文艺路线。周扬妄想从这里钻空子，把自己装扮成无产阶级文艺路线的代表，明目张胆地攻击鲁迅代表的是修正主义路线、资产阶级路线，这完全是枉费心机。
    一九六二年，《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十周年的时候，就是《鲁迅全集》有关“国防文学”的注释出版四年以后，周扬又一次站出来给“国防文学”这个口号翻案。他在这年十一月三日召开的《中国现代文学史》讨论会上说：
    应该肯定两个口号都可以用，都对，都有优点缺点。“国防文学”口号提得早，容易为大家接受，但缺点不能表现无产阶级立场；后一个口号，有“革命”、有“大众”，很好，但有些人赞成抗日，见到革命、大众就害怕，在当时情况下，应当相互配合、补充。胡风起了挑拨作用，冯雪峰责任更大。他当时以鲁迅和党中央名义反对“国防文学”的口号。胡风、冯雪峰起了分裂作用。当时双方面都夹杂了宗派情绪。
    本来，不论是在一九三六年两个口号论争进行的时候，或是一九五八年他们编造《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》的注释的时候，周扬都是彻底否定“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个口号的。这时突然改变腔调，说什么“应该肯定两个口号都可以用，都对”，里头是有阴谋的。这是迫于形势采取的一种手法，是作贼心虚的掩饰之词，是言不由衷的。
    解放以来，周扬象变色龙一样，对于“国防文学”的评价，随着社会上阶级斗争形势的变化而变化，但他那条修正主义文艺的黑线却是一贯到底的。
    最近几年，周扬大声喧嚷所谓“全民的文化”和为“全体人民”服务的文艺。一九五九年，他在解放军第二届文艺会演大会干部座谈会上说：“什么叫社会主义文化呢？就是全民的文化。”同年他在北京大学讲课的时候，又说“我们的文艺是全民的”。一九六一年七月二十八日，他在北京文艺工作座谈会上说：“全国人民都是服务对象。这一点和延安文艺座谈会不同，比那时广泛了。”一九六一年六月二十三日，他在全国故事片创作会议上讲：“有的作品则是既反映阶级利益，又反映全体人民的利益。”“艺术作品是任何一个阶级都可以接受的，一个阶级产生的作品不能只供本阶级欣赏，否则这个作品是失败的。”在一九六二年，周扬打着纪念《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的幌子反对《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，打着毛泽东文艺思想的红旗反对毛泽东文艺思想。他在一些谈话和所写论文中，公然提出一条所谓为“全体人民”服务的修正主义文艺路线。周扬强调“今天的情况同二十年前不同”，他竟然说“我国人民已经胜利地完成了”“社会主义革命”。因此，“人民民主统一战线内的以工农兵为主体的全体人民都应当是我们的文艺服务的对象和工作的对象”。周扬的意思就是说，毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》已经过时了，现在的文艺要为全民服务。这是三十年代“国防文学”的借尸还魂，是它在今天条件下的变种，是反对毛泽东文艺思想的一个集中表现。
    很明显，周扬所喧嚷的“全民的文化”，同他三十年前鼓吹的“全民族的文学”，是一脉相承的，是同一条修正主义黑线的产物。
    现在，真相已经大白：三十年代文艺黑线的“祖师爷”，不是别人，正是周扬。
    田汉和夏衍曾分别自封为三十年代戏剧界和电影界的“老头子”，他们在鼓吹“三十年代文艺”的问题上都是很卖力气的吹鼓手，但是站在他们背后挥舞指挥棒的却是周扬。
    代表修正主义的黑线，把它从三十年代贯穿到六十年代的，正是周扬。
    解放以来，我国文艺界的一切坏东西，几乎都来源于周扬这个修正主义文艺的“祖师爷”。在文艺战线上激烈的阶级斗争中，周扬成了包庇一切牛鬼蛇神的“大红伞”。
    周扬这些钻进党内来的资产阶级代表人物，长期篡踞我国文艺工作的领导地位，对无产阶级的革命文艺实行资产阶级专政，为在我国复辟资本主义准备条件。
    我们必须高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，彻底破除对所谓三十年代文艺的迷信，彻底铲掉从“国防文学”贯穿下来的文艺战线上的黑线，彻底清除周扬的修正主义黑线在文艺工作中的影响，坚定不移地把这场无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
