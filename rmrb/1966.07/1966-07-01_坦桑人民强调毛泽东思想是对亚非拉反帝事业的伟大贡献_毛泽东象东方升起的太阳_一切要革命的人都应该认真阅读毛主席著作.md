    The Tanzanian people highly cherish Chairman Mao's works. They believe that Mao Zedong Thought is a great contribution to the struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism. A Tanzanian government official said, "Today, all the people are looking towards Beijing, towards Chairman Mao."

    A Tanzanian national leader recently said to the Chinese Ambassador when he presented him with four volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" (English version): "Chairman Mao's works are the most precious gift to the African people."

    Now, more and more Tanzanian friends are eager to obtain Chairman Mao's works. A Tanzanian who recently visited China told a Chinese friend here that one of the most important results of his visit to China was bringing back four volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." A Tanzanian government official pointed out: "All those who want revolution should seriously study Chairman Mao's works."

    Tanzanian friends highly appreciate Chairman Mao's scientific judgments. A Tanzanian national leader talked to a Chinese friend about Chairman Mao's statement, "Strategically, we must despise all enemies; tactically, we must take all enemies seriously." He said he fully agreed with this point, which can be applied to Tanzania's struggle against colonialism and imperialist subversion and aggression.

    A Tanzanian government minister said that about twenty years ago, Chairman Mao correctly pointed out that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." Today, this statement still has important practical significance.

    Some Tanzanian people also use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the international situation. A Tanzanian journalist told a reporter: "Chairman Mao's thought is spreading all over the African continent. Its power is far greater than a prairie fire." He pointed out that Chairman Mao's thought can be applied to any problem at any time and under any conditions.

    The Tanzanian people love Chairman Mao deeply and have profound feelings for him. Not long ago, when a Chinese youth delegation visited Tanzania, a Tanzanian youth leader told the Chinese guests: "Mao Zedong is like the rising sun in the East. When we see him, it means we see the rising sun in the East." After watching Chinese youth artists perform revolutionary songs and dances, the Tanzanian people shouted: "We support you. Thank you, China, thank you, Mao Zedong!" An African youth who lost his right arm waved his left arm excitedly towards the Chinese youth delegation and shouted passionately: "Revolution will win! Long live Mao Zedong!"

    A Tanzanian minister told a Chinese friend that after reading most of the articles in Volume Four of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," he was most impressed by Chairman Mao's firm belief in the people. He said that no other leader could have such deep feelings for the people and such firm belief in them as Chairman Mao. Some Tanzanian dignitaries and delegations expressed a strong desire to meet Chairman Mao during their visits to China. A Tanzanian female leader said that she felt very fortunate to have seen Chairman Mao. A Tanzanian government official said: "Today, all the people are looking towards Beijing, towards Chairman Mao."

    Two years ago, during the exhibition of Chinese economic construction in the capital, tens of thousands of Tanzanian people watched Chinese films. Whenever Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, the audience burst into thunderous applause. They excitedly shouted: "Mao Zedong—Mao Zedong!" In the crowded exhibition hall, every day a large number of people stood in front of a giant picture of Chairman Mao talking to peasants in the rice fields. One day, a reporter saw a Tanzanian peasant standing in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, gazing at it for a long time, then he touched the picture of Chairman Mao's hand with his hand and happily said: "Chairman Mao is very healthy."

    The Tanzanian people highly praise the great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought. Recently, Tanzanian Minister of Rural Development and National Culture Mgonja praised Chairman Mao as the great leader of the Chinese revolution. He said: "Today, China is the true hope of all oppressed peoples in the world. The hope of newly liberated countries lies in the great country of China."

    Recently, the editor of the Tanzanian magazine "Africa Alert," Karom Jumale, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "Without the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, it is impossible to find the secret and source of the great achievements of the 650 million Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China."

    坦桑人民强调毛泽东思想是对亚非拉反帝事业的伟大贡献
    毛泽东象东方升起的太阳
    一切要革命的人都应该认真阅读毛主席著作
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆二十九日电　坦桑尼亚人民十分热爱毛主席著作，他们认为，毛泽东思想是对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争事业的伟大贡献。一位坦桑尼亚政府官员说，“今天，所有的人民都眼望着北京，眼望着毛主席。”
    一位坦桑尼亚国家领导人最近在中国大使向他赠送四卷《毛泽东选集》（英文版）时说：“毛主席的著作是给非洲人民的最宝贵的礼物。”
    现在，越来越多的坦桑尼亚朋友渴望得到毛主席的著作。一位最近访问过中国的坦桑尼亚人在这里对中国朋友说，他访问中国的最重要成果之一，就是带回了四卷《毛泽东选集》。一位坦桑尼亚政府官员指出：“一切要革命的人都应该认真阅读毛主席的著作。”
    坦桑尼亚朋友非常赞赏毛主席的科学论断。一位坦桑尼亚国家领导人对中国朋友谈到毛主席的“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”这一论断时说，他非常赞同这一论点，这一论点可以用于坦桑尼亚反对殖民主义和帝国主义颠覆和侵略的斗争。
    坦桑尼亚政府的一位部长说，约在二十年以前，毛主席就正确地指出了“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”。今天，这一论断仍有着重要的现实意义。
    一些坦桑尼亚人士还运用毛泽东思想分析国际形势。一位坦桑尼亚新闻工作者对记者说：“毛主席的思想正在整个非洲大陆传播。它的威力远远地超过了燎原之火。”他指出，毛主席思想在任何时间和任何条件下适用于任何问题。
    坦桑尼亚人民非常热爱毛主席，对他怀有深厚的感情。不久前，当中国青年代表团访问坦桑尼亚时，一位坦桑尼亚青年领袖对中国客人说：“毛泽东象东方升起的太阳。当我们看到他，这就是说我们看到了东方升起的太阳。”坦桑尼亚人民在看了中国青年艺术家们表演的中国革命歌舞之后高呼：“我们支持你们。感谢中国，感谢毛泽东！”一位失去右臂的非洲青年向中国青年代表团激动地挥动他的左臂，热情地高呼：“革命必胜！毛泽东万岁！”
    一位坦桑尼亚部长对中国朋友说，他读了《毛泽东选集》第四卷的大部分文章后，印象最深的是毛主席坚决相信人民。他说，没有任何别的领袖能象毛主席那样对人民有那么深厚的感情和那么坚决相信人民。一些坦桑尼亚贵宾和代表团在访问中国期间十分殷切地要求见到毛主席。一位坦桑尼亚妇女领袖说，她生平感到十分幸福的是看到了毛主席。一位坦桑尼亚政府官员说：“今天，所有的人民都眼望着北京，望着毛主席。”
    两年前，在这里举办中国经济建设展览会期间，坦桑尼亚首都数以万计的人民看了中国电影。每当毛主席在银幕上出现时，观众中就爆发出雷鸣般的掌声。他们激动地高呼：“毛泽东—毛泽东！”在拥挤的展览馆大厅内，每天有大批人站在大厅中央展示毛主席在稻田里同农民交谈的巨幅图片面前。有一天，记者看到一位坦桑尼亚农民站在毛主席象前面，久久地凝视着毛主席，然后他用手摸摸画片上的毛主席的手，高兴地说：“毛主席很健康。”
    坦桑尼亚人民高度赞扬中国人民在毛主席思想指导下所取得的巨大胜利。最近，坦桑尼亚乡村发展和国民文化部长姆贡贾称赞毛主席是中国革命的伟大领袖，他说：“中国今天是全世界一切受压迫人民的真正希望。新解放国家的希望在于伟大的国家中国。”
    坦桑尼亚杂志《非洲警惕》主编卡荣朱迈勒最近对新华社记者说：“没有毛泽东思想的光辉，要发现在中国共产党领导下的六亿五千万中国人民的巨大成就的奥秘和源泉是不可能的。”（附图片）
