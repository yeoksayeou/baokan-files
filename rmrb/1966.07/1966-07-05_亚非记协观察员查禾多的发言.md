	The observer Qia Heduo of the Asian-African Journalists Association said at the plenary meeting of the Emergency Conference of Asian-African Writers today that the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as progressive groups around the world, are increasingly recognizing the importance of establishing a broad and genuine united front against U.S. imperialism and old and new colonialism. He said that this united front should be as broad as possible, including all forces that are genuinely and resolutely anti-imperialist, but should not and cannot include the accomplices and defenders of imperialism, that is, the fake revolutionaries.

	Qia Heduo pointed out that the Emergency Conference of Asian-African Writers is of historical significance and will greatly strengthen the progressive anti-imperialist front.

	He said that this conference is being held in the capital of the great Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are now not only vigorously and victoriously building socialism at home but also showing the most principled attitude towards the issue of imperialism.

	Qia Heduo strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' bombing of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and the city of Haiphong. He said that this world demon of U.S. imperialism, in its undeclared war, has exposed its most vicious acts of aggression to the world. U.S. imperialism has escalated its pirate aggression against Vietnam to a new stage.

	He said that the political awareness of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as progressive groups around the world, is increasingly high, and they can distinguish between enemies and friends.

	He said that the people of the world no longer believe in the hypocritical lies of U.S. imperialism, nor do they believe in the sweet talk of the fake revolutionaries of the Soviet Union. The fake revolutionaries of the Soviet Union claim to genuinely support the people's anti-imperialist struggle, but in reality, they collude and closely cooperate with the enemy of the world's people, U.S. imperialism.

	Qia Heduo said that we support the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. He demanded that the U.S. and its puppet troops immediately withdraw from South Vietnam and immediately and unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	He pointed out that any attempt, under any pretext or in any form, to "aid the Vietnamese people" but whose real purpose is to legalize U.S. aggression, is not only a blatant betrayal of the Vietnamese people but also a blatant betrayal of the people of the world who are fighting for complete national independence.

	Qia Heduo condemned the U.S. imperialists' support for the reactionary forces in Indonesia, establishing a fascist military dictatorship led by Nasution and Suharto, and massacring tens of thousands of innocent Indonesian people. He pointed out that the setbacks suffered by the Indonesian people are temporary, and the traitorous government of Indonesia has fallen into a deep abyss of difficulties.

	He said that Asian-African journalists and Asian-African writers are jointly fighting for the liberation of the peoples of all countries and for the struggle to free themselves from imperialism and colonialism. Our two organizations will become increasingly strong. We will further mobilize the progressive people of the world to fight against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and accomplices, and we will persist in exposing their vicious faces.

    亚非记协观察员查禾多的发言
    新华社四日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会观察员查禾多今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，亚非拉人民和世界的进步团体，越来越懂得建立一个广泛的真正的反对美帝国主义和新老殖民主义的统一战线的重要性。他说，这个统一战线应当尽量广泛，包括所有真诚地和坚决地反帝的力量，但不应该而且也不能包括帝国主义的帮凶和辩护士，即假革命者。
    查禾多指出，亚非作家紧急会议具有历史意义，它将大大加强进步的反帝阵线。
    他说，这次会议是在伟大的中国人民的首都召开的。中国人民在共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，现在不仅是轰轰烈烈地、胜利地在国内建设社会主义，而且在对待帝国主义的问题上表现了最有原则的态度。
    查禾多强烈谴责美帝国主义轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内和海防市。他说，美帝国主义这个世界恶魔竟在它的不宣而战的战争中，向全世界暴露了它最恶毒的侵略罪行。美帝国主义已把对越南的强盗侵略“升级”到一个新的阶段。
    他说，亚非拉人民和世界的进步团体，政治觉悟已越来越高，能够分清敌友。
    他说，全世界亿万人民再也不相信美帝国主义一套虚伪的鬼话，同样也不相信苏联假革命者的甜言蜜语。苏联假革命者说他们是真正支持人民的反帝斗争，而实际上他们却同世界人民的敌人美帝国主义互相勾结，密切合作。
    查禾多说，我们支持越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。他要求美国及其仆从的军队立即从越南南方撤走，并立即无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸。
    他指出，不论在什么幌子掩盖下或以任何方式“援助越南人民”而实质上其目的却在于使美国侵略合法化的任何企图，不仅是对越南人民的公然背叛，而且是对为取得完全的民族独立而斗争的世界人民的公然背叛。
    查禾多谴责美帝国主义支持印度尼西亚反动势力，建立了一个纳苏蒂安和苏哈托为首的法西斯军事独裁政权，屠杀成千成万的印度尼西亚无辜人民。他指出，印度尼西亚人民所遭受的挫折是暂时的，印度尼西亚卖国政权已经掉进了困难的深渊。
    他说，亚非新闻工作者和亚非作家是在共同为各国人民获得解放，摆脱帝国主义和殖民主义而斗争。我们两个组织将越来越坚强，我们将进一步动员全世界的进步人民同美帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶进行斗争，我们坚持揭露他们恶毒的面目。
