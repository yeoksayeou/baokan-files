The Temporary People's Consultative Assembly, manipulated by Indonesian rightists, concluded after half a month of sessions on June 6. This farce, directed by the rightist military clique with bayonets, passed more than twenty reactionary "decrees" and "resolutions." This nominal highest authority of Indonesia legalized the military coup and seizure of power by the rightist military clique, and solidified their reactionary domestic and foreign policies into legal forms, providing a "legal basis" for further reactionary policies.

According to reports from the Jakarta radio and Western news agencies, the conference passed 23 decrees, two resolutions, and one letter. These include demands for the government to rejoin the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, and other international organizations under U.S. control; an order to immediately stop opposition to "Malaysia"; the abolition of the "Jakarta-Beijing axis" in foreign affairs; the dissolution of the Indonesian Communist Party, declaring it illegal, and prohibiting the spread of communist and Marxist-Leninist doctrines; the current cabinet will be replaced by a "new cabinet" controlled by Suharto on August 17; the dissolution of all government agencies deemed inconsistent with the 1945 Constitution within three months; the scheduling of a "general election" in July 1968; the abolition of Sukarno's title of "President for Life"; the appointment of Suharto as Acting President when Sukarno is unable to perform his duties; the establishment of a special committee to review Sukarno's doctrines, decrees, laws, and decisions; and so on.

On the first day of the conference, the leader of the rightist military clique, Nasution, was elected as the "Chairman of the Temporary People's Consultative Assembly." The conference also approved Sukarno's "March 11 Order," elevating it to a "resolution of the Temporary People's Consultative Assembly." According to Agence France-Presse, on June 27, Suharto told reporters about this "resolution," openly stating that the Temporary People's Consultative Assembly's approval of the "March 11 Order" gave him a "legal basis" for all actions he might take. He bluntly said that from then on, he had "greater freedom of action."

The conference, originally scheduled to begin on June 1, was postponed twice due to "security considerations" and finally started on June 20. Reports from Western news agencies and Indonesian news agencies and radio stations indicate that this was a pure fascist farce. Before and during the conference, the rightist military clique applied tremendous pressure inside and outside the venue. Before the conference, Nasution, Suharto, and the armed forces, parties, and organizations they controlled issued statements and declarations one after another, vowing to "completely eliminate" all individuals and groups that "disrupted" the conference, and loudly advocating that the "March 11 Order" be made a formal resolution of the Temporary People's Consultative Assembly; they promoted the idea that this "Temporary People's Consultative Assembly" was fully functioning as a People's Consultative Assembly, to give a "legal" cover to the "resolutions" they forced through.

At the same time, the rightist military clique frequently mobilized heavy troops to Jakarta and other places where there were signs of opposition to their actions. Before the conference, the rightist military clique had mobilized its "four branches of the military, as well as civil defense and student militia," to strictly control Jakarta. Throughout the conference, the entire venue was filled with a murderous atmosphere, guarded by fully armed troops, tanks, and armored vehicles. The number of troops transferred to Jakarta from other places increased day by day. The Associated Press reported on June 5 that on that day, "about 80,000 troops were deployed to the outskirts of the capital." They also held "shows of force" military exercises in the major cities of Central Java, such as Semarang, Yogyakarta, and Surakarta. Meanwhile, Nasution openly incited the thugs he raised, the "KAMI" ("Indonesian University Student Action Front") and "KAPPI" ("Indonesian Youth Student Action Front"), to organize so-called "Temporary People's Consultative Assembly representatives on the streets," continuously holding rallies and demonstrations in Jakarta and around the venue to "fight outside the Temporary People's Consultative Assembly" for the rightist military clique.

Reports from Western news agencies and Japanese newspapers pointed out that this Temporary People's Consultative Assembly was a conference where Indonesian rightist forces completely eliminated Sukarno's power and legalized their reactionary domestic and foreign policies. The United Press International's report on June 5 said that this conference actually changed "every major aspect" of Indonesia's policy before the military coup by the rightist military clique, "completing the process of making Sukarno a puppet president in name and reality." The Asahi Shimbun's editorial on June 7 said that this conference "almost completely legalized the actions of the military since the 'September 30th Movement,'" and Sukarno's administrative powers, legislative powers, and powers to issue decrees "were almost all stripped away." It pointed out that despite this, the rightist military clique faced "severe economic crises," and the emotions opposing them were "quite strong," and the problems that the "polycentric politics" centered on Suharto had to solve were indeed numerous and serious.

    印尼右派操纵的临时人民协商会议收场
    通过一系列反动法令使右派法西斯统治“合法化”  悍然宣布共产党非法并且停止对抗“马来西亚”
    新华社九日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派将领集团夺取政权以后，第一次召开的临时人民协商会议（第四次会议），历时半月，在六日收场。这出由右派将领集团用刺刀导演的法西斯丑剧，通过了为数多达二十多个的反动“法令”和“决定”。这个印度尼西亚名义上的最高权力机构把右派将领集团发动军事政变、夺取政权的非法行动“合法化”，并把它政变以来所推行的一系列反动的内外政策，用法律形式固定了下来，还为它进一步推行反动政策，提供了“法律基础”。
    据雅加达电台和西方通讯社报道，会议通过的二十三个法令、两项决定和一个信件，包括要求政府重新参加美国控制的联合国、国际货币基金组织和其它世界机构；下令立即停止对“马来西亚”的对抗；废除在外交方面的“雅加达—北京轴心”；解散印度尼西亚共产党，宣布它非法，并禁止传播共产主义和马克思列宁主义学说；现内阁将在八月十七日由实际上是苏哈托把持的“新内阁”接替；在三个月内解散被认为与一九四五年宪法规定不符合的一切政府机构；规定一九六八年七月举行“大选”；取消苏加诺“终身总统”的头衔；在苏加诺不能执行他的职务时，由苏哈托担任代总统；任命特别委员会对苏加诺的教义、法令、法律和决定进行审查；等等。
    在会议第一天，右派将领集团头目纳苏蒂安就被推戴为“临时人民协商会议主席”。会议还批准苏加诺交出权力的“三月十一日命令书”。把这个“命令书”“提高为临时人民协商会议的决定”。据法新社报道，六月二十七日，苏哈托对记者发表谈话谈到这一“决定”时，公然说，临时人民协商会议批准“三月十一日命令书”，就使得他可能采取的一切行动都有了“法律根据”。他毫不掩饰地说，从此他“有更大的行动自由”。
    这次会议原定六月一日开始举行，由于“安全方面的考虑”，两度延期，直到六月二十日举行。西方通讯社和印度尼西亚通讯社和电台的报道表明，这是一幕地地道道的法西斯丑剧。在会议举行前和会议举行期间，右派将领集团在会场内外疯狂地施加压力。会议举行前，纳苏蒂安、苏哈托和他们控制的武装部队各兵种、党派、团体，一个接着一个地发表谈话和声明，叫嚷决心“彻底剿灭”一切“破坏”这个会议的个人和集团，大肆叫嚣会议应把“三月十一日命令书”作为临时人民协商会议的正式决定；鼓吹这次“临时人民协商会议起着完全的人民协商会议的职能”，为他们强行在这个会议上通过的“决定”披上“合法”外衣。
    同时，右派将领集团频繁调集重兵到雅加达和其他出现反对右派将领集团行动的地方。在会议前，右派将领集团曾动员了它手下的“四个兵种的部队以及民防和学生民兵部队”严密控制雅加达。在整个会议举行期间，全场内外一片杀气腾腾，始终由全副武装的军队和坦克、装甲车守卫。从外地调到雅加达的军队一天比一天增多，美联社五日报道，在四日这天，“大约有八万军队调到首都周围的据点”。他们还在三宝垄、日惹、梭罗等中爪哇各大城市举行了“显示力量”的军事演习。与此同时，纳苏蒂安还公开煽动它豢养的“卡米”（“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”）、“卡比”（“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”）暴徒，组织所谓“街上的临时人民协商会议代表团”，不断在雅加达市和会场周围举行集会和示威游行，为右派将领集团“在临时人民协商会议的外面进行斗争”。
    西方通讯社和日本报刊的报道都指出，这次临时人民协商会议是印度尼西亚右派势力彻底清除苏加诺的权力并使它推行的内外反动政策合法化的一次会议。合众国际社五日的报道说，这次会议实际上完全改变了印度尼西亚在右派将领军事政变以前的政策的“每一个主要内容”，“完成了三月十一日开始的使苏加诺名副其实地成为傀儡总统的过程”。《朝日新闻》七日的社论说，这个会议“几乎全面地把‘九月三十日事件’以后的军方的行动加以合法化”，苏加诺所拥有的行政权、制定法律、政令等权限“几乎都被剥夺”。它指出，尽管这样，右派将领集团所面临的“经济危机”，反对它的情绪的“相当强烈”，“以苏哈托为中心的‘多头政治’所必须解决的问题实在多而且严重”。
