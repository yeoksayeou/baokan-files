The Indonesian right-wing military group, after intense arguments and bargaining, announced the formation of a new cabinet on the 25th. This was announced by Sukarno, who is under the control of the right-wing military group.

According to a broadcast by the Jakarta radio station, the new cabinet does not have a prime minister but is composed of a cabinet chairmanship council made up of the main ministers of five departments. The head of the Indonesian right-wing military group and the main minister of the Defense and Security Department, Suharto, serves as the chairman of the chairmanship council. The other four main ministers of the departments are: Political Department: Adam Malik, People's Welfare Department: Idham Chalid, Economic and Financial Department: Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX, Industry and Development Department: Sanusi Hardjadinata. Among the 24 ministers in the new cabinet, 12 are military personnel from the right-wing military group.

The U.S. news agency reported that this new cabinet was formed by Suharto, who serves as the chairman of the chairmanship council, "which in effect strips Sukarno of direct leadership over the cabinet," making Suharto "clearly in control of the government."

Agence France-Presse reported: "In recent years, the prime minister's position held by President Sukarno has been eliminated in the new cabinet." "In fact, all of President Sukarno's close friends and confidants have been expelled from the cabinet. They include the former deputy prime minister Leimena and another deposed deputy prime minister, the leader of the Nationalist Party, Ruslan Abdulgani."

Since March of this year, the Indonesian right-wing military group has been taking a series of steps to complete their plan to seize state power. At that time, they arrested 15 cabinet ministers, including the first deputy prime minister and foreign minister Subandrio and the third deputy prime minister Harun Tjokroaminoto, establishing a cabinet chairmanship council controlled by Suharto and five other deputy prime ministers, seizing power, but still retaining the empty title of prime minister for Sukarno. The formation of this reactionary cabinet, which they control, will make it even more convenient for them to implement their reactionary domestic and foreign policies.

    印尼右派将领集团拼凑成新反动内阁
    美通讯社说苏哈托“剥夺了苏加诺对内阁的直接领导权”
    据新华社二十七日讯  雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派将领集团在经过激烈争吵和讨价还价后二十五日再次宣布组成新内阁。这是由在右派将领集团挟持下的苏加诺宣布的。
    据雅加达电台广播，新内阁不设总理，由五个部组的主要部长组成内阁主席团，印度尼西亚右派将领集团的头目、国防和安全部组主要部长苏哈托担任主席团主席。其他四个部组的主要部长是：政治部组：阿达姆·马利克、人民福利部组：伊达姆·哈利德、经济和财政部组：苏丹·哈孟库·布沃诺、工业和发展部组：萨努西·哈查迪纳塔。在新内阁的二十四名部长中，有十二名部长是右派将领集团的军人。
    美国通讯社的报道指出，这个新内阁是苏哈托一手组成的，苏哈托担任内阁主席团主席，“这就在实际上剥夺了苏加诺对内阁的直接领导权”，使苏哈托“明显地控制了政府”。
    法新社的报道说：“最近几年来苏加诺总统占有的总理职位在新内阁中被搞掉了。”“实际上，苏加诺总统所有的亲密朋友和亲信都从内阁中被排挤出去。他们包括上届政府的副总理莱梅纳和另一个被黜的副总理、民族党领导人鲁斯兰·阿卜杜加尼”。
    印度尼西亚右派将领集团今年三月以来加紧采取一系列步骤来完成它们夺取国家政权的计划。当时，它逮捕了包括第一副总理兼外交部长苏班德里约、第三副总理哈鲁尔·萨勒在内的十五名内阁部长，建立了由苏哈托等六名副总理控制的内阁主席团，掌握了政权，但给苏加诺仍然保留着总理的空头名义。这次组成由它一手控制的反动内阁，将更加便于它放手地推行反动的对内对外政策。
