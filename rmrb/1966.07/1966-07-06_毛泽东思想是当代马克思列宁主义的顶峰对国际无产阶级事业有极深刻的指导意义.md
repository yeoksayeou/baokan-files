The Hanoi-based *New Vietnam-China News* published an editorial on July 1st to mark the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. The editorial stated that the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, over the course of its 45 years, has led the Chinese people in a heroic struggle and achieved great victories. It is a period during which Marxism-Leninism has been widely disseminated and achieved great triumphs in China. It is also a period during which the invincible weapon of the world's revolutionary people—the thought of Mao Zedong—has been formed, developed, and played an extremely significant theoretical and practical role globally.

The editorial said: The brilliant and great victories achieved by the Communist Party of China in leading the Chinese revolution are inseparable from the correct leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. The experience of the Chinese people achieving revolutionary victories under the leadership of the Communist Party of China can be summed up in one fundamental point: Mao Zedong Thought must be the guiding principle. Over the past 45 years, Mao Zedong Thought has been like a red thread running through the entire history of the Communist Party of China. Wherever and whenever Mao Zedong Thought has been the guiding principle, the revolution has rapidly developed and moved towards victory. Wherever and whenever Mao Zedong Thought has been violated, the revolution has committed rightist and "leftist" opportunist errors, leading to setbacks and failures.

The editorial said, Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. It is the creative and comprehensive inheritance and development of Marxism-Leninism by Chairman Mao Zedong based on the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, summarizing the positive and negative experiences of the Chinese revolution and international revolution.

The editorial said, Chairman Mao Zedong's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, in the face of the current trend of revisionism in the international communist movement, is a mirror that exposes all demons and ghosts. Chairman Mao Zedong, based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, summarized the practical experiences of the dictatorship of the proletariat and class struggle in China, studied the positive and negative experiences of the world revolution, especially the Soviet Union, and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat and scientific socialism. He systematically proposed the theory of class, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society. Through repeated practices in the Chinese and world revolutions, it has been fully proven that Chairman Mao Zedong's theory on this issue is completely correct.

The editorial said, the formation and development of Mao Zedong Thought have undergone repeated tests of domestic and international class struggles, reflecting the objective laws of this struggle, and are unshakable truths. Mao Zedong Thought is precisely adapted to this great historical era and is the highest and most vibrant Marxism-Leninism. It has great and profound theoretical and practical significance for the international proletarian revolutionary cause.

The editorial, when discussing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China, said, this is a struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, a struggle between restoration and anti-restoration, a struggle between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and revisionism. To understand the great historical significance of this earth-shaking revolution that touches the depths of every person's soul, we can only analyze it using the perspective of class, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society as advocated by Mao Zedong Thought.

The editorial said, Chairman Mao Zedong, summarizing domestic and international experiences, led the entire Chinese people to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution using the theory of class struggle. Therefore, this revolution will undoubtedly have an immeasurable and far-reaching impact on the development of the world revolution and the future of human development.

The editorial said: "The Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, with high principles and flexibility, have waged an uncompromising and head-on struggle against modern revisionism, defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism." The editorial said: "Khrushchev's ouster is a great failure and bankruptcy of modern revisionism, a great victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought."

The editorial described the conspiracy of modern revisionism colluding with American imperialism to encircle and isolate China, saying, revolutionary China cannot be isolated. The friends of China are everywhere. The people of the world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, all regard China as the Yan'an of the world revolution and place their hopes in the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong. A handful of jumping jacks, the more they try to isolate China, the more isolated they themselves become. In the end, they will only lift the stone to drop it on their own feet and reap the consequences.

The editorial said, modern revisionism, imperialism, and reactionaries in various countries are racking their brains and using every means to try to "contain" the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. However, truth is irresistible, and Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought cannot be "contained." The revolutionary enemies are terrified of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. While the revolutionary people regard it as their soul and life. Now, all revolutionaries in the world are reading Chairman Mao's books and learning Mao Zedong Thought. They seek the path to revolutionary success in Chairman Mao's works and regard Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon for victory. They deeply feel that to make a revolution, one cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought.

The editorial said: "Mao Zedong Thought, once grasped by the broad masses of the people, spiritual force can be transformed into boundless material force. New China is becoming more and more prosperous, the imperialist 'blockade' has failed, and the revisionist plot to strangle China has been foiled. The Chinese people have won, Mao Zedong Thought has won, and it will continue to win!"

The New China News Agency reported from Hanoi on July 5th that people from various regions in North Vietnam have been holding various activities to enthusiastically celebrate the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.

From June 29th to July 2nd, factories such as the "August 8th" Textile Factory, Hai Chau Food Processing and Candy Factory, Hanoi Soap Factory, Kim Star Rubber Factory, Thanh Long Cigarette Factory, and Dong Sang Hot Water Bottle and Light Bulb Factory in Hanoi, as well as various schools and Vietnam-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperatives, held celebrations.

At the celebration held jointly by over a thousand workers from the "August 8th" Textile Factory and the Hai Chau Food Processing and Candy Factory, Comrade Le Tai Bau, a member of the Hanoi City Committee of the Labor Party and the Party Secretary of the "August 8th" Textile Factory, enthusiastically praised the great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong in the people's democratic revolution and in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. He said, the Communist Party of China has always been loyal to the communist ideal, consistently holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, consistently holding high the banner of opposing imperialism led by the United States, and consistently supporting the national liberation movement and the struggle for socialism and world peace without any conditions.

At other celebrations, the leaders of various units unanimously pointed out in their speeches that the brilliant victories of the Chinese revolution are the victories of the correct line led by the great leader of the Chinese people and the respected friend of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. It is the victory of the Communist Party of China holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism. It is the victory of the Chinese people learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, insisting on putting politics in command, and carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. At these meetings, workers and agricultural cooperative members repeatedly raised slogans such as "Long live the Communist Party of China!", "Long live Chairman Mao!", and "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam!"

The Vietnam-China Friendship Association held an exhibition titled "Chinese Picture Exhibition" in Hanoi on July 1st to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. The exhibition, divided into three parts: "Rich and Majestic China," "Building the Motherland," and "Vietnam-China Friendship Forever," introduced the great achievements of the Chinese people in industry, agriculture, national defense, and culture under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China.

At the opening ceremony of the exhibition, Comrade Nguyen Van Hung, Secretary-General of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, gave a speech summarizing the great achievements of the great China and the fraternal Chinese people in socialist construction under the wise and creative leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the respected leader of the Communist Party of China. He expressed his belief that under any circumstances, the peoples of Vietnam and China will always be brothers, comrades, and close comrades-in-arms, fighting side by side for the interests of the peoples of the two countries, for peace, national independence, democracy, and the socialist cause.

In recent days, workers, agricultural cooperative members, and people's army units in cities such as Haiphong and Nam Dinh, as well as other places in North Vietnam, have also held meetings or reports.

    越南《新越华报》就中国共产党成立四十五周年发表社论
    毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰对国际无产阶级事业有极深刻的指导意义
    越南北方人民热烈庆祝中国共产党的生日
    新华社河内一日电  河内《新越华报》一日就中国共产党成立四十五周年发表社论指出，伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党成立的四十五年，是中国共产党领导全中国人民进行英勇斗争和取得伟大胜利的四十五年，是马克思列宁主义在中国广泛传播和取得伟大胜利的四十五年，是全世界革命人民战无不胜的强大武器——毛泽东思想的形成、发展和在全世界范围起了极其伟大的理论和实践意义的四十五年。
    社论说：中国共产党领导中国人民革命取得的光辉、伟大的胜利，是和毛泽东主席的正确的领导分不开的。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下取得革命胜利的经验，千条万条，毛泽东思想挂帅是最根本的一条。四十五年来，毛泽东思想就象一根红线一样，从始到终贯穿着中国共产党的历史。凡是毛泽东思想挂帅的地区和时期，革命就迅速发展，走向胜利。凡是违背毛泽东思想的地区和时期，革命就犯右的和“左”的机会主义的错误，使革命遭到挫折和失败。
    社论说，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是毛泽东主席根据马克思列宁主义基本原理，总结了中国的革命实践和国际革命的正面和反面经验，天才地、创造性地、全面地继承和发展了的马克思列宁主义。
    社论说，毛泽东主席关于无产阶级专政的学说，对于当前国际共产主义运动出现修正主义思潮的情况下，是一面光芒四射的照妖镜，一切牛鬼蛇神都照得现出原形来。毛泽东主席根据马克思列宁主义原理，总结了中国无产阶级专政和阶级斗争的实践经验，研究世界革命的、主要是苏联的正面和反面经验，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政和科学社会主义的学说，系统地提出了关于社会主义社会的阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的理论。通过中国革命和世界革命的反复实践，完全证明了毛泽东主席关于这一问题的学说，是完全正确的。
    社论说，毛泽东思想的形成和发展，正是经历了国内国际阶级斗争的反复的考验，反映了这一斗争的客观规律，是颠扑不破的真理。毛泽东思想正是适应我们的这一伟大的历史时代而产生的，它是最高最活的马克思列宁主义。它对于国际无产阶级革命事业具有极大的、极深刻的理论意义和实践意义。
    社论在谈到目前中国进行的无产阶级文化大革命时说，这是一场革命和反革命的斗争，是复辟和反复辟的斗争，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同修正主义的斗争。对于这场惊天动地、触及每个人的灵魂深处的大革命，我们只能运用毛泽东思想的社会主义社会的阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争观点分析，才能理解它的伟大的历史意义。
    社论说，毛泽东主席总结了国内和国际的经验，运用阶级斗争的学说领导全中国人民进行无产阶级文化大革命。因此，这场革命对于世界革命的发展、对于人类发展的未来都必将有着不可估量的深远的影响。
    社论说：“中国共产党和毛泽东同志，以高度的原则性和灵活性，同现代修正主义进行了毫不妥协的、针锋相对的斗争，捍卫了马克思列宁主义的纯洁性。”社论说：“赫鲁晓夫的被撵下台，是现代修正主义的大失败、大破产，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的大胜利。”
    社论叙述了现代修正主义同美帝国主义勾结，妄图包围中国、孤立中国的阴谋后说，革命的中国是孤立不了的，中国的朋友遍天下，全世界人民，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民都把中国看作是世界革命的延安，都把希望寄托给中国共产党和毛泽东主席。一小撮跳梁小丑，愈是要孤立中国，就愈是显得它们自己更加孤立。到头来，只能搬起石头砸自己的脚，自食恶果。
    社论说，现代修正主义、帝国主义和各国反动派，挖空心思，想尽办法要“遏制”毛泽东思想的传播。但是，真理是不可抗拒的，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想是“遏制”不了的。革命的敌人对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想害怕得要死。而革命人民却把它看作是灵魂、是生命。现在世界上一切革命者都在读毛主席的书，学习毛泽东思想，他们要在毛泽东主席的著作中找寻革命成功的道路，把毛泽东思想作为争取胜利的武器。他们切身体会到要革命就离不开毛泽东思想。
    社论说：“毛泽东思想掌握了广大人民群众，精神力量就能转化为无穷无尽的物质力量。新中国越来越繁荣昌盛，帝国主义的‘封锁’失败了，修正主义要卡死中国的阴谋破产了。中国人民胜利了，毛泽东思想胜利了，并且还将继续取得胜利！”

    在其他单位的庆祝会上，各单位负责人在讲话中一致指出，中国革命的光辉胜利，是以中国人民的伟大领袖、越南人民敬爱的朋友毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的正确路线的胜利，是中国共产党高举马克思列宁主义旗帜的胜利，是中国人民活学活用毛泽东思想、坚持突出政治、发扬自力更生的革命精神的胜利。在这些集会上，工人们和农业社社员们不断振臂高呼“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“越中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”等口号。
