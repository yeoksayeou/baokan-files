    Comrade Liu Yingjun sacrificed his precious life without hesitation for the safety of six children. This is the result of being nurtured by the great thought of Chairman Mao. Only the soldiers of the people's army created by Chairman Mao can do this. I am determined to learn from Comrade An Yemin and Liu Yingjun to be a vanguard of the proletarian cultural revolution.

    Comrade Liu Yingjun stood firm in the ideological struggle and had a keen sense of smell. As early as 1964, he wrote an article criticizing Feng Ding's "justice impulse theory," truly a vanguard on the cultural revolution front. We must not forget the martyr's will: "We must also deeply understand that as long as our revolutionary ranks are politically complacent and lose vigilance against counter-revolutionaries, we will provide these counter-revolutionaries with the conditions to carry out activities." For a long time, I had insufficient understanding of the class struggle in the ideological realm and insufficient understanding of Chairman Mao's important instruction: "After the armed enemies are eliminated, the unarmed enemies still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us." Therefore, I was highly vigilant and strictly guarded against those enemies who raised white flags, but I was blind to the class struggle in the ideological realm, thinking that a few stinking intellectuals with a broken pen writing a few articles and scripts were of no consequence and could not harm our proletarian iron fortress. The facts revealed in this proletarian cultural revolution have shocked me. It turns out that many anti-party elements have already occupied the socialist cultural front, attempting to restore capitalism. With these questions in mind, I reviewed Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China," and gained a deeper understanding of this great revolution that touches people's souls. This is a life-and-death political struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, a top priority for China's future. I am determined to take Comrade Liu Yingjun as an example, actively participate in this struggle, sweep away all monsters and demons, and forever be loyal to the Party, loyal to socialism, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao, to be a vanguard of the cultural revolution.

    安业民烈士生前班长，二等战斗功臣
    法库县调兵山公社后峪大队贫协主席  刘忠元
    刘英俊同志为了六名儿童的生命安全，毫不犹豫地献出了自己的宝贵生命，这是伟大毛泽东思想哺育的结果，只有毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队的战士才能做得到。我决心象学习安业民那样学习刘英俊，作无产阶级文化大革命的尖兵。
    刘英俊同志在意识形态领域的阶级斗争中，立场坚定，嗅觉锐敏，早在一九六四年他就写出了批判冯定的“正义冲动论”的文章，不愧为文化革命战线上的尖兵。我们一定不要忘记烈士的遗嘱：“我们还必须深刻认识，只要我们革命队伍的成员在政治上麻痹大意，对反革命丧失警惕，那就会提供这些反革命分子以进行活动的条件。”在很长一段时间里我对思想领域的阶级斗争认识不足，对毛主席说的：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争”这个重要的教导认识不足。因此，仅对那些打着白旗的敌人警惕很高，看管很严，但对意识形态领域中的阶级斗争，却视而不见。认为几个臭文人，拿支破笔，写几篇文章，编几个剧本，无关大局，奈何不了我们无产阶级的铁打江山。这次无产阶级文化大革命中揭发出来的一些事实，使我大吃一惊。原来不少反党分子已经占领了社会主义文化阵地，妄图复辟资本主义。我带着这些问题，重温了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》，对这场触及人们灵魂的大革命，有了进一步的认识，这是一场资产阶级和无产阶级你死我活的政治斗争，是关系到中国前途的头等大事。我决心以刘英俊同志为榜样，积极地投入到这场斗争中去，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，永远忠实于党，忠实于社会主义，忠实于毛泽东思想，忠实于毛主席，做文化大革命中的尖兵。
