The Supreme National Defense Council of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement.

	Mobilize All National Forces, Strengthen People's Armed Forces, Sacrifice Everything to Defeat American Aggressors

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 17th - The full text of the statement issued by the Supreme National Defense Council of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was published here today.

	In early July 1966, the Supreme National Defense Council of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, under the chairmanship of Comrade Ho Chi Minh, held a meeting.

	The Supreme National Defense Council listened to reports on the combat and production situation of our military and people, analyzed the enemy's plots, and made major decisions to vigorously promote the patriotic war of resistance against American imperialist aggression.

	1. To salvage its heavy defeats in its war of aggression against our South, since early February 1965, American imperialism has used its air force to wage a destructive war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, an independent and sovereign state. It has blatantly violated the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Vietnamese Question and various principles of international law. The military and people of the North, responding to the call of the Party, the government, and Comrade Ho Chi Minh, have turned hatred into strength, actively produced, fought bravely, and resolutely defended and built the socialist North, wholeheartedly supporting the patriotic resistance of our southern compatriots. In the past seventeen months, the military and people of the North have shown great courage and achieved extremely significant victories: they have shot down nearly 1,200 American aircraft, captured many American air pirates, rapidly strengthened our national defense forces, maintained public order, ensured transportation, developed production, and the people's lives remain stable. Through the battles against the American air force, our military and people have become stronger, more clearly recognized the enemy's weaknesses, more clearly recognized the invincible power of people's war, and more firmly believed in our inevitable victory.

	The Supreme National Defense Council warmly commends the significant victories achieved by the military and people of our North in the past period.

	In the South, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front, the heroic military and people of the South have fought with unparalleled bravery, repeatedly defeating American imperialism and its lackeys. The southern compatriots and liberation armed forces have highly developed the spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, closely combined armed struggle with political struggle, highly exerted the superiority of people's war, creatively applied the strategic and tactical principles of people's war, unprecedentedly developed people's war, defeated the American imperialists' "dry season offensive," and initially frustrated their local war. Despite the fact that American imperialism has sent more than thirty thousand American expeditionary forces and its mercenaries into the South, and despite the fact that it has used modern weapons, equipment, and the most brutal means of war, American imperialism and its lackeys have suffered extremely heavy defeats, and are increasingly falling into a passive and desperate situation, increasingly sinking into a quagmire in South Vietnam. The glorious victories of the southern compatriots have played an extremely important role in our people's cause of liberating the South and defending the North.

	The Supreme National Defense Council warmly welcomes the unparalleled fighting spirit and the great victories achieved by the southern compatriots.

	2. The more American imperialism sends troops to the South, the more it suffers defeats; the more it escalates the war in the North, the more it falls into a desperate struggle. The ferocious and extremely stubborn American imperialism, like a wounded beast, is increasingly following the path of escalating and expanding its war of aggression. It is continuing to send more American expeditionary forces and its mercenaries to the South, continuing to intensify its air war against the North, and at the same time, constantly spreading its deceptive "peace talks" rhetoric.

	On June 29th and 30th, American imperialism brazenly sent aircraft to bomb the suburbs of the capital Hanoi and the city of Haiphong, which is a very serious new escalation of the war. Every day, American aggressor aircraft bomb and strafe our northern cities, villages, factories, dikes, sluices, hospitals, schools, nurseries, temples, and churches. The enemy's crimes have received the punishment they deserve from our military and people.

	The bombing of the suburbs of Hanoi and Haiphong does not indicate the enemy's strength at all; on the contrary, it only shows that the enemy is making a desperate struggle, exposing its failure, passivity, and helplessness.

	American imperialism wants to intimidate our people. However, its crimes only make the anger of our people burn more fiercely, further deepening our nation's hatred for the American aggressors and their lackeys, and further strengthening our people's determination to fight to the final victory.

	The brutal actions of American imperialism have made it more isolated than ever and have aroused strong indignation from the governments and people of socialist countries and the governments and people of countries that love peace and uphold justice around the world.

	We sternly warn American imperialism: The Vietnamese nation is a heroic nation with a tradition of unyielding struggle against foreign aggression, a nation that "prefers to sacrifice everything rather than allow the country to be conquered, rather than be slaves." The crimes of American imperialism have already and are now receiving the punishment they deserve. Our entire military and people will not hesitate to make any sacrifice, will exert every effort, with an iron will, resolutely fight, and are determined to defeat the American aggressors.

	3. American imperialism, on the road to failure, is frantically escalating its war of aggression against our country. Although its plots are extremely vicious, our people's just war of resistance against American aggression has already achieved many victories and will inevitably achieve greater and greater victories.

	The Supreme National Defense Council has comprehensively studied the situation and made some important decisions to mobilize the strength of the entire people, strengthen the people's armed forces, strengthen national defense, and smash all the plots and actions of American imperialism.

	The Supreme National Defense Council calls on the entire people and the people's armed forces to carry forward the tradition of national bravery and unyielding spirit, carry forward the spirit of patriotism, and resolutely promote the cause of resistance against American aggression to the final victory.

	The cadres and soldiers of the people's armed forces must further carry forward the spirit of decisive battle and decisive victory, hit hard and accurately, shoot down more American aircraft, sink more American warships, and annihilate and capture more American aggressors.

	The cadres and soldiers of the public security forces must maintain public order in various places even better.

	The cadres and workers of the transportation sector must strive to launch competitions and ensure that transportation is unobstructed under any circumstances.

	Workers, peasants, intellectuals, and young brothers and sisters must raise their enthusiasm for production and work, successfully fulfill the state plan, actively assist the troops and fight the enemy together with the troops, and actively serve the cause of resistance against American aggression and socialist construction.

	For the sake of fraternal love, to fulfill the glorious mission of the rear to the front, all the military and people of the North must wholeheartedly support the patriotic resistance of our southern compatriots.

	This resistance against American aggression is the greatest cause in the history of our nation's struggle against foreign aggression and liberation.

	Our people have never been as closely united and as strong as they are today.

	Our people have never received as much sympathy and support from the people of the world as they do today.

	Our entire military and people are not afraid of any hardships and sacrifices and are determined to realize our sacred wish: to defeat the American aggressors, defend the North, liberate the South, and ultimately reunify the country.

	American imperialism will be defeated!

	Our people will be victorious!

　　越南民主共和国最高国防会议发表公报
　　动员全民力量　加强人民武装  不惜任何牺牲　战胜美国强盗
    新华社河内十七日电这里十七日公布了越南民主共和国最高国防会议发表的公报，公报全文如下：
    一九六六年七月初，越南民主共和国最高国防会议在胡主席的主持下召开了会议。
    最高国防会议听取了关于我国军民的战斗和生产情况的报告，分析了敌人的阴谋，作出了为大力促进抗击美帝国主义侵略的爱国战争的重大决定。
    一、美帝国主义为了挽救它在侵略我国南方的战争中所遭到的惨重失败，从一九六五年二月初以来，使用空军对越南民主共和国——一个独立和拥有主权的国家进行了破坏性的战争。它已经明目张胆地违反了一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议和国际法的各项准则。北方军民响应党、政府和胡主席的号召，把仇恨化为力量，积极生产，英勇战斗，坚决保卫和建设社会主义的北方，全心全力支援南方同胞的爱国抗战。在过去的十七个月中，北方军民表现勇敢，并取得了极其重大的胜利：击落美国飞机近一千二百架，活捉许多美国飞贼，我国的国防力量迅速壮大，维持了治安秩序，保证了交通运输，发展了生产，人民的生活仍然稳定。通过抗击美国空军的战斗，我国军民越打越强，更加认清了敌人的弱点，更加认清了人民战争的无敌力量，更加坚信自己的必然胜利。
    最高国防会议热烈表彰我国北方军民在过去期间所取得的重大胜利。
    在南方，在民族解放阵线的领导下，英雄的南方军民进行了无比英勇的战斗，接连战胜了美帝国主义及其走狗。南方同胞和解放武装力量高度发扬爱国主义和革命英雄主义的精神，把武装斗争和政治斗争紧密结合起来，高度地发挥人民战争的优越性，创造性地运用了人民战争的战略和战术原则，空前未有地发展了人民战争，战胜了美帝国主义的“旱季攻势”，初步挫败了它的局部战争。尽管美帝国主义把三十多万美国远征军和它的帮凶军开进南方，尽管它使用了现代化的武器、装备和最残暴的战争手段，但是美帝国主义及其走狗却遭到了极其惨重的失败，在军事上和政治上日益陷入被动的窘境，在越南南方日益陷入无法自拔的泥潭。南方同胞的辉煌胜利，对我国人民解放南方和保卫北方的事业起了极其重大的作用。
    最高国防会议热烈欢迎南方同胞无比英勇的战斗精神和所取得的巨大胜利。
    二、美帝国主义越向南方增派军队，越遭到失败；越对北方进行战争“升级”，越摔得痛。
    穷凶极恶和极端顽固的美帝国主义如同一头遭到沉重打击后的野兽一样，日益沿着加强和扩大侵略战争的冒险道路走下去。它正在继续向南方增派美国远征军及其帮凶军，正在继续加紧用空军对北方进行破坏性战争，同时不断散布它的“和平谈判”的欺骗论调。
    六月二十九日和三十日，美帝国主义悍然派遣飞机轰炸首都河内郊区和海防市，这是一个极其严重的新的战争“升级”。每天，美国强盗飞机对我们北方的各个城市、村庄、工厂、堤坝、水闸、医院、学校、托儿所、寺庙、教堂进行轰炸和扫射。敌人的这些罪行，遭到了我们军民给予的应有的惩罚。
    轰炸河内郊区和海防市这一事件，丝毫不能表明敌人的强大，恰恰相反，只能说明敌人在作绝望的挣扎，暴露出它的失败、被动和束手无策的窘态。
    美帝国主义妄想吓倒我国人民。但是，它的罪恶只能使我国人民的怒火烧得更旺，进一步加深了我们民族对美国强盗及其走狗的不共戴天的仇恨，更加增强了我国人民战斗到最后胜利的决心。
    美帝国主义的残暴行动，更加使它遭到空前的孤立，并激起了社会主义国家的政府和人民、世界上爱好和平和主持公理的国家的政府和人民的强烈愤慨。
    我们严厉警告美帝国主义：越南民族是一个具有抵御外侮的、“宁愿牺牲一切而决不容许祖国被征服、决不当奴隶”的不屈不挠斗争传统的英雄民族。美帝国主义的罪行已经并且正在遭到应有的惩罚。我们全国军民不惜任何牺牲，尽一切努力，以钢铁般的意志，坚决战斗，决心战胜美国侵略强盗。
    三、美帝国主义在走向失败的道路上，正在疯狂地加强对我国的侵略战争。尽管它的阴谋非常恶毒，但我国人民的抗美救国正义战争已经取得许多胜利，并且必将日益取得越来越巨大的胜利。
    最高国防会议全面地研究了形势，并作出了一些重要的决定，以动员全民的力量，加强人民武装力量，加强人民国防，粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋和行动。
    最高国防会议号召全民和人民武装力量发扬民族的英勇不屈的传统，发扬爱国精神，坚决促进抗美救国事业直到最后胜利。
    人民武装力量的干部和战士，必须进一步发扬决战决胜的精神，狠狠地打、准准地打，击落更多的美国飞机、击沉更多的美国舰艇，消灭和活捉更多的美国侵略强盗。
    人民公安干部和战士，必须把各地方的治安秩序维持得更好。
    交通运输部门的干部和工作人员，必须努力展开竞赛，保证交通运输在任何情况下都畅通无阻。
    工人、农民、脑力劳动者和青年兄弟姐妹们，必须提高生产和工作热情，胜利地实现国家计划，积极协助部队并且同部队一起打击敌人，积极为抗美救国事业和社会主义建设事业服务。
    为了骨肉情义，为了负起大后方对大前方的光荣任务，北方全体军民必须全心全力支援南方同胞的爱国抗战事业。
    这场抗美救国战斗，是我们民族抵抗外国侵略的解放斗争历史中的最伟大的事业。
    我国人民从来没有象今天这样的紧密团结和这样强大。
    我国人民从来没有象今天这样得到世界人民的广泛的同情和支持。
    我们全国军民决不怕任何艰苦、牺牲，决心实现我们的神圣愿望：战胜美国侵略强盗，保卫北方，解放南方，进而统一祖国。
    美帝国主义必败！
    我国人民必胜！
