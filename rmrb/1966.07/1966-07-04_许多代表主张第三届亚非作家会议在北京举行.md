The Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Conference continues to strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' frenzied aggression against Vietnam.

Many representatives advocate for the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing.

Representatives enthusiastically praise Mao Zedong Thought: Great Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism! History is progressing in the direction indicated by Mao Zedong, the great leader of the world's people!

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated July 3rd, the Afro-Asian writers gathered in Beijing today continued to strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes of frenzied aggression against Vietnam. They pointed out that the more the U.S. imperialists "escalate" the war of aggression against Vietnam, the faster and more miserably they will fail. The U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong is a sign of desperation, a sign of its increasing weakness. The people of Asia and Africa must fully support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. Some representatives shouted at the meeting: "We want the Vietnamese people, not the Americans!"

The representatives from various countries and regions attending the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Conference continued to hold full-day plenary sessions today. The representatives pointed out at the meeting that in dealing with imperialism and its lackeys, only relentless struggle is the way; without completely eliminating the world's number one enemy, U.S. imperialism, there can be no world peace and human progress.

Many representatives, in their speeches, enthusiastically praised the great Mao Zedong Thought. They said, only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought can the oppressed people thoroughly defeat imperialism led by U.S. imperialism. "Without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no new world!"

At today's meeting, one after another representative took the stage, speaking in different languages, voicing the common aspirations of the people of Asia and Africa: "Great Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism." "Revolutionaries can only achieve victory by holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, which is of decisive significance to the struggle for the liberation of all humanity." "History is progressing in the direction indicated by Mao Zedong, the great leader of the world's people." "Mao Zedong Thought will surely illuminate the whole world!"

Representatives from Indonesia, Palestine, North Kalimantan, Sierra Leone, Portuguese Guinea, Thailand, and Yemen made speeches full of anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist fighting spirit at today's plenary session. (Summaries of speeches by representatives of various countries are on page six today.)

At the morning session, Indonesian representative Agam Wisby suggested that the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference be held in Beijing. He severely condemned the despicable behavior of Soviet modern revisionists in splitting the Afro-Asian writers' movement. He said that due to the current political situation in Indonesia, it is impossible to hold the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference as originally planned in Indonesia. Revolutionary Indonesian writers, as the original hosts of the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference, suggest that the most suitable place to hold this conference is in the People's Republic of China. At this point, the entire audience stood up, and thunderous applause erupted.

Representatives from North Kalimantan, Thailand, and Yemen also expressed their full agreement with the suggestion of the Indonesian delegation at today's meeting.

Newly arrived representatives from the fighting Congo (Leopoldville) addressed the conference, expressing their heartfelt congratulations on the success of the conference and their full support for the struggle of the Vietnamese people, strongly condemning the crimes of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

Representatives from Laos, Malaya, Nepal, Azania (South Africa), Basutoland, and Bechuanaland served as the executive chairpersons for the morning session. The executive chairpersons for the afternoon session were representatives from North Kalimantan, the Philippines, Palestine, Cameroon, the Canary Islands, and the Comoros Islands.

    据新华社三日讯　在北京聚会的亚非作家们，今天继续强烈谴责美帝国主义疯狂侵略越南的滔天罪行。他们指出，美帝国主义侵略越南的战争越是“升级”，它失败得就越快、越惨。美帝轰炸河内和海防，是狗急跳墙，是它更加虚弱的表现，亚非人民一定要全力支持越南人民的正义斗争。有的代表在会上高呼：“要越南人民，不要美国佬！”
    出席亚非作家紧急会议的各国和地区的代表，今天继续全天举行全体会议。代表们在会上指出，对付帝国主义及其走狗，只有进行无情的斗争；不彻底消灭全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义，就不可能有世界和平和人类进步。
    许多代表在发言时还热烈地赞颂了伟大的毛泽东思想。他们说，被压迫人民只有掌握了毛泽东思想，才能彻底打败以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义。“没有毛泽东思想，就没有新世界！”
    在今天的会议上，一个又一个代表走上讲台，用不同的语言发出了亚非各国人民共同的声音：“伟大的毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰”。“革命者只有高举对全世界人类的解放斗争具有决定意义的毛泽东思想的旗帜，才有可能取得革命的胜利”。“历史正按照毛泽东——世界人民伟大的领袖所指出的方向前进。”“毛泽东思想必将普照全世界！”
    印度尼西亚、巴勒斯坦、北加里曼丹、塞拉勒窝内、“葡属”几内亚、泰国和也门等国（地区）代表在今天的全体会议上，作了充满反帝反殖战斗精神的发言。（各国代表发言摘要均见今日第六版）
    在上午的会议上，印度尼西亚代表阿甘姆·维斯比在发言时建议第三届亚非作家会议在北京举行。他严厉谴责了苏联现代修正主义者分裂亚非作家运动的丑恶行为。他说，由于印度尼西亚目前的政治形势，要按原计划在印度尼西亚召开第三届亚非作家会议是不可能的。革命的印度尼西亚作家，作为原本是第三届亚非作家会议的主人，我们建议举行这个会议的最合适地点是在中华人民共和国。这时，全场起立，掌声雷动。
    北加里曼丹代表文铭权、泰国代表古腊·柿巴立和也门代表萨利赫·达汉在今天会上发言时都表示完全同意印度尼西亚代表团的建议。
    新到会的来自战斗的刚果（利）的代表向大会致了贺词，表示衷心祝贺会议取得成功，并表示全力支持越南人民的斗争，强烈谴责美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的罪行。
    老挝、马来亚、尼泊尔、阿扎尼亚（南非）、巴苏陀兰、贝专纳等国（地区）代表担任今天上午会议的执行主席。担任下午会议执行主席的是北加里曼丹、菲律宾、巴勒斯坦、喀麦隆、加那利群岛、科摩罗群岛等国（地区）代表。
