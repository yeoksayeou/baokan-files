The Japanese government on July 26 brazenly announced that it would refuse entry to Liu Ningyi, the head of the Chinese delegation to the 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. This is another violent act by the Sato government aimed at disrupting Sino-Japanese relations. The Chinese people are extremely indignant about this and strongly protest against the Sato government!

Liu Ningyi is the chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, a leader of the Chinese state, and also one of the founders of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. He participated in the first World Conference in 1955. He also attended the 6th Conference in 1960, the 10th Conference in 1964, and the 11th Conference in 1965. Liu Ningyi and the members of the Chinese delegation have visited Japan multiple times, contributing actively to the cause of banning atomic and hydrogen bombs and strengthening the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan. Why did the Sato government suddenly use a ridiculous pretext to prevent Liu Ningyi and the Chinese delegation from entering Japan this time?

The reason is simple. On July 7, Raske, the spokesman for American imperialism, held talks with Sato. Then, on July 24, Gromyko, the spokesman for the Soviet revisionist leadership, also appeared in Tokyo. According to reports, the secret talks between the Soviet Union and Japan are still ongoing. It is clear that this is a grand performance of the joint anti-China efforts by American imperialism, Japanese militarism, and the Soviet revisionist leadership. The Sato government's arrogant refusal to allow Liu Ningyi to enter is by no means a coincidence.

American imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership, and Japanese militarism are most afraid of the combat unity of the peoples of China and Japan, who have American imperialism as their common enemy. They are also afraid of the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs upholding its glorious tradition of raising the banner of struggle against American imperialism and splitism. They are afraid of the powerful movement in Japan calling for friendship with the Chinese people. They are trying to disrupt the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, disrupt the glorious tradition of the World Conference, and disrupt the Sino-Japanese friendship movement. This serves the interests of the American and Japanese reactionaries and meets the needs of the Soviet revisionist leadership. Therefore, when the Sato government announced its refusal to allow Liu Ningyi to enter, it said that it had considered the consequences this decision would have for Sino-Japanese relations.

However, the broad masses of the Japanese people will never agree with the Sato government's open hostility towards China. Even some enlightened individuals within the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan will not agree with the Sato government's reckless and unreasonable measures. Now, there are some people with ulterior motives who are participating in the conspiracy to obstruct Liu Ningyi's visit to Japan, undermining the Sino-Japanese friendship movement from within, and acting as a flank for American imperialism to "contain" China. We cannot help but feel deeply regretful about this phenomenon, which is a source of pain for friends and joy for enemies.

The peoples of China and Japan, now and in the future, will stand shoulder to shoulder in the common struggle against American imperialism. The combat friendship and great unity between the peoples of China and Japan cannot be destroyed by any reactionary forces. American imperialism cannot destroy it, the Sato government cannot destroy it, and the Soviet revisionist leadership and its various new and old followers cannot destroy it either. Whoever tries to obstruct the wheel of history and disrupt the unity of the peoples of China and Japan will ultimately reap what they sow and be smashed to pieces!

    中日两国人民的战斗友谊是破坏不了的
    本报评论员
    日本政府于七月二十六日悍然宣布，拒绝前往日本参加第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的中国代表团团长刘宁一入境。这是佐藤政府蓄意破坏中日关系的又一个粗暴行动。中国人民对此表示极大的愤慨，并对佐藤政府提出强烈的抗议！
    刘宁一同志是中华全国总工会的主席，是中国国家领导人之一，同时又是众所周知的禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的创始人之一。一九五五年第一届世界大会就有刘宁一同志参加。一九六○年第六届世界大会、一九六四年第十届世界大会、一九六五年第十一届世界大会，刘宁一同志也都参加了。刘宁一团长和中国代表团的成员都是不止一次地访问过日本，对禁止原子弹氢弹的事业和加强中日两国人民友好，都作出了积极的贡献。为什么这一次佐藤政府竟以荒谬绝伦的借口，阻止刘宁一同志为首的中国代表团前往日本呢？
    原因很简单。今年七月七日，美帝国主义强盗的代言人腊斯克同佐藤举行了会谈。接着，七月二十四日，苏联修正主义领导集团的代言人葛罗米柯，也出现在东京。据报道，迄今为止，苏日密谈尚在继续中。很明显，这是美帝国主义、日本军国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团联合反华的大会演。佐藤政府这一次蛮横地拒绝刘宁一团长入境，完全不是偶然的。
    美帝国主义、苏联修正主义领导集团和日本军国主义，它们最害怕的，是以美帝国主义为共同敌人的中日两国人民的战斗团结，是禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会坚持它的光荣传统——高举反对美帝国主义和反对分裂主义的战斗旗帜，是日本人民要求同中国人民友好的一浪高过一浪的强大运动。它们力图破坏中日两国人民的战斗友谊，破坏世界大会的光荣传统，破坏中日友好运动。这样做，既符合美日反动派的利益，也适应苏联修正主义领导集团的需要。因此，佐藤政府在宣布拒绝刘宁一团长入境的时候竟然说，它已考虑到了这一决定将给中日关系带来的后果。
    但是，日本的广大人民，是决不会同意佐藤政府这一公开敌视中国的行动的。甚至日本自由民主党内的有识之士，也不会同意佐藤政府的这一不计后果的无理措施。现在竟然有些挂羊头卖狗肉的居心叵测的人们，参与了阻挠刘宁一同志访日的阴谋，从内部来破坏日中友好运动，替美帝国主义充当“遏制中国”的一个侧翼。对于这样一个为亲者痛、仇者快的现象，我们不能不感到十分遗憾。
    中日两国人民，现在和将来，在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中，都是而且必将是肩并肩地紧密团结在一起的。中日两国人民之间的战斗友谊和伟大团结，是任何反动势力也破坏不了的。美帝国主义破坏不了，佐藤政府破坏不了，苏联修正主义领导集团及其形形色色的新旧追随者，也是破坏不了的。谁想阻挡历史车轮，破坏中日两国人民的团结，到头来必将自食其果，被碰得头破血流！
