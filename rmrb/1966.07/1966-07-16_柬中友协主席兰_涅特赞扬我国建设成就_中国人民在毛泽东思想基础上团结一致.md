Chairman of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association Lan Neth Praises China's Construction Achievements
The Chinese People United Under the Guidance of Mao Zedong Thought

According to Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, July 14th - Recently, in a report, the Chairman of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association, Lan Neth, praised the unity of the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

He said: The unity of the Chinese people is indisputable. Seven hundred million Chinese people all take Mao Zedong Thought as the foundation for their unity. Lan Neth made these remarks at a symposium held by the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association on July 10th, reporting on the impressions of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation's visit to China in April and May this year. Members of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation, Dethina and Hou Rong, also gave reports.

Lan Neth pointed out that Chinese arts are continuously advancing, and they are always reforming; recently, they have carried out large-scale reforms. The Chinese people, based on Mao Zedong Thought, have thoroughly reformed Peking Opera. For a long time, Peking Opera has been considered an unassailable fortress.

In his speech, Lan Neth praised China's economic construction. He said, "We have seen that since 1949, since liberation, since breaking free from imperialist rule, in less than twenty years, if we compare the People's Republic of China with European countries, China's progress is very rapid. The economy of the People's Republic of China is no longer backward. 'As long as one pays a little attention to its efforts, it is certain that in the near future, it will advance very rapidly, certainly catching up with and surpassing the progress of Western countries.'"

He also said, "China's development in the field of nuclear weapons shows that China is already very advanced. He also said: Because the Soviet Union stopped supplying China with oil, it caused difficulties in China's oil supply. Therefore, China, based on Mao Zedong Thought, the spirit of self-reliance, explored for oil on its own, and finally found oil. Now, they have sufficient oil. In the future, they will discover even more oil."

When talking about the friendship between Cambodia and China, Lan Neth said, "The friendship between Cambodia and China is a friendship with a long history and is eternal. Recently, this friendship has become even closer. He emphasized: 'Since 1953, under the wise leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Head of State and President of the Sangkum, and the Honorary Chairman of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China, the friendship between our two countries, which has already existed, has been further developed.' He said: 'The friendship between our two countries is eternal, just like the flowing waters of the Yangtze River and the Mekong River that never cease.'"

Hou Rong reported on the impressions of visiting Chinese factories and people's communes.

He said: People's communes are extremely important in rural areas. The commune members said that during difficult times, the people's communes played a very important role in overcoming difficulties and withstood all tests. Now, no matter who goes to visit, everyone acknowledges this. Everywhere they went, there was an ample supply of pork, chickens, and vegetables.

　　柬中友协主席兰·涅特赞扬我国建设成就
　　中国人民在毛泽东思想基础上团结一致
    据新华社金边十四日电　柬埔寨中国友好协会主席兰·涅特最近在一次报告中，赞扬中国人民在毛泽东思想的基础上建立的团结一致。
    他说：中国的团结一致是无可置疑的。七亿中国人民都以毛泽东思想作为他们团结一致的基础。兰·涅特是在柬埔寨中国友好协会七月十日举行的座谈会上，就他率领的柬埔寨中国友好协会代表团在今年四月和五月访问中国的观感作报告的。柬中友协代表团的成员狄弟娜和胡荣也作了报告。
    兰·涅特指出，中国的艺术在不断向前发展，他们一直在进行改革；最近进行了大规模的改革。中国人民根据毛泽东思想，对京剧进行了彻底的改革。长期以来，京剧被认为是碰不得的难以攻克的堡垒。
    兰·涅特在讲话中赞扬了中国的经济建设。他说，我们看到，中国自从一九四九年解放以来，自从摆脱了帝国主义统治以来，还不到二十年，如果把中华人民共和国同欧洲国家相比，中国进步的速度是非常快的。中华人民共和国的经济已经不再是落后的。“只要稍稍注意一下它所作出的努力，在不久的将来，它肯定将非常迅速地前进，肯定将赶上和超过西方国家的进展。”
    他还说，中国在核武器方面的发展表明中国已经是非常先进的。他又说：因为苏联停止供应中国的汽油，曾经造成了中国汽油供应上的困难。因此，中国根据毛泽东思想，自力更生的思想，自己努力勘探石油，他们终于找到了石油。现在，他们已经有了充足的石油。今后，他们还将发现更多的石油。
    兰·涅特在谈到柬中两国的友谊时说，柬中两国的友谊是有悠久历史的永恒的友谊。最近，这种友谊发展得更加紧密了。他强调指出：“自从一九五三年完全独立以来，在国家元首、人民社会同盟主席和柬中友协名誉主席诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王英明领导下的柬埔寨王国，在毛泽东主席领导下的中华人民共和国，进一步发展了我们两国之间已经存在的友谊。”他说：“我们两国的友谊是永恒的友谊，就象长江和湄公河的流水常流不息。”
    胡荣报告了参观中国工厂和人民公社的观感。
    他说：人民公社在农村是极为重要的，社员们说，在困难时期，人民公社起了克服困难的极为重要的作用，并且经受住了一切考验。现在，不管谁去参观，谁都承认这一点。所到之处，猪肉、鸡和蔬菜都供应充足。
