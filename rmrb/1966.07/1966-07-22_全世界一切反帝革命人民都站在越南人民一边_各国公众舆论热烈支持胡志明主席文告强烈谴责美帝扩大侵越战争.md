The people of the world who oppose imperialism and revolution are all on the side of the Vietnamese people. Public opinion in various countries strongly supports Chairman Ho Chi Minh's statement, resolutely condemning the U.S. imperialists' expansion of the war in Vietnam.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, public opinion in various countries strongly supports Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Nation," firmly supports the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and strongly condemns the U.S. imperialists' heinous crime of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong.

The editorial of the Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published on the 20th said that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Nation," Chairman Ho Chi Minh's order to mobilize part of the reserve forces, and other measures taken to further strengthen national defense, express the Vietnamese people's unshakable determination to carry out their just struggle to the end, until they defeat the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys.

The editorial condemns the U.S. imperialists, through their friends and lackeys—from Wilson, Brezhnev, and Kosygin to Tito and Indira Gandhi—engaging in various activities to realize their "peace talks" deception, aiming to obtain what they cannot get on the battlefield. The editorial points out that reconvening the Geneva Conference is just a new conspiracy of U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world. However, no cunning tricks and fake anti-imperialist slogans can cover up the U.S.-Soviet cooperation, nor can they cover up the betrayal of the Vietnamese people by Soviet revisionists.

On the 19th, more than two thousand people in Ceylon held a mass rally in Colombo. Samugathasan, a member of the Ceylon Communist Party Central Committee Political Bureau and the Secretariat, condemned U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam in his speech. He also pointed out that while the Soviet revisionists express fake support for the Vietnamese people, in reality, they not only have not provided effective aid commensurate with their national strength, but also have contributed to Johnson's "peace" deception.

He finally said that the Vietnamese people's resistance against U.S. imperialist war may last for several years. However, the Vietnamese people will ultimately win this war.

Alrajiawana, the chairman of the Ceylon-China Friendship Association, expressed support for Chairman Ho Chi Minh's recent "Letter to the Nation" in his speech. He pointed out that the struggle in Vietnam proves the correctness of Chairman Mao Zedong's thesis that in war, people are more important than weapons. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism cannot win in Vietnam.

Recently, Sithon Kumdan, deputy chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, spoke to the Pathet Lao radio station reporter, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' heinous crime of bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, and reiterating the Lao people's firm determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with their Vietnamese brothers and fight to the end against U.S. imperialism. Kumdan said that this action by U.S. imperialism will not make the Vietnamese people yield, but will only deepen the Vietnamese people's hatred for it and launch more resolute counterattacks. The more frantically U.S. imperialism expands the war, the closer it comes to death.

On the 20th, various industrial unions affiliated with the General Council of Japanese Trade Unions held meetings in various parts of the country to express their resolute support for Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Letter to the Nation." On the evening of the 19th, about 6,500 people in Nagoya held meetings in two places to protest against the U.S. expansion of aggression in Vietnam. Participants also held a demonstration march. One of the marching teams had demonstrators leading with a coffin symbolizing Johnson, shouting, "Yankees, go home!" in front of the U.S. Consulate.

On July 19, women in West Bengal, India, held an anti-U.S. demonstration outside the U.S. Information Service Library in Calcutta. The demonstrators condemned the crimes of the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam and demanded that the U.S. immediately stop bombing North Vietnam and withdraw all U.S. troops from South Vietnam.

The leaders of the youth organization of the Congo (Brazzaville) expressed their support for the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. Recently, Adouki, the chairman of the Congo General Union of Students, pointed out in his annual report at the second congress of this union: "The Vietnamese people show every day that a truly freedom-loving nation is invincible, no matter how small it is." Recently, Beiri Madan, vice-chairman of the executive committee of the youth organization of the National Revolutionary Movement, condemned U.S. imperialism at a meeting in the capital as "the chief culprit of aggression in the world."

On the 18th, General Jara, a famous figure in Mexico, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter in an angry tone that every person with a sense of justice should stand up and condemn the crime of the Johnson administration bombing Hanoi and Haiphong.

Mexican economist Agilar Alonzo, in condemning the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, said that no force can stop the Vietnamese people from advancing bravely, and no force can stop the Vietnamese people's struggle for liberation from achieving final victory.

On the 20th, the Africa-Asia-Latin America Solidarity Association of Guyana issued a statement expressing support and respect for the heroic Vietnamese people and demanding that the U.S. and its henchmen withdraw from Vietnam.

On the evening of the 17th, 5,000 workers, students, and housewives in London held a rally in Trafalgar Square to protest against U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

Many people spoke at the rally, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam and expressing support for the American people who resolutely oppose the U.S. war in Vietnam.

On the 21st, many people in New Zealand held a demonstration march in Auckland to oppose the U.S. war in Vietnam. The demonstrators held up signs saying "U.S. out of Vietnam" and "New Zealand out of Vietnam," marched through the city center, and submitted a statement to the U.S. Consulate and the Auckland City Government, strongly protesting the U.S. violation of the Geneva Agreement.

    全世界一切反帝革命人民都站在越南人民一边
    各国公众舆论热烈支持胡志明主席文告强烈谴责美帝扩大侵越战争
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国公众舆论热烈支持胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，强烈谴责美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防的滔天罪行。
    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十日发表的社论说，胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》、胡志明主席关于动员一部分后备兵员的命令，以及为进一步增强国防能力而采取的其它措施，表达了越南人民要把自己的正义斗争进行到底，直到打败美国侵略者及其仆从为止的毫不动摇的决心。
    社论谴责美帝国主义者通过他们的朋友和仆从——从威尔逊、勃列日涅夫、柯西金到铁托、甘地夫人进行各种活动，企图实现他们的“和谈”骗局，以得到他们在战场上得不到的东西。社论指出，重新召开日内瓦会议只不过是美苏合作主宰世界的新阴谋而已。但是，任何狡猾的伎俩和假反帝的口号都掩盖不住苏美合作，都掩盖不住苏联修正主义者对越南人民的背叛。
    锡兰两千多人十九日在科伦坡举行群众大会，锡共中央政治局委员、书记处书记桑穆加塔桑在讲话中谴责美帝国主义侵略越南。他还指出，苏联修正主义者在对越南人民表示假支持的同时，事实上不仅没有提供同他们的国力相称的有效援助，而且还为约翰逊的“和平”骗局出力。
    他最后说，越南人民目前抵抗美帝国主义的战争可能要持续好几年。但是越南人民在这场战争中最终会胜利。
    锡中友好协会主席阿拉季亚瓦纳在讲话中表示支持胡志明主席最近发表的《告全国同胞书》。他指出，越南的斗争证明了毛泽东主席关于在战争中人比武器更重要的论断的正确性。他指出，美帝国主义在越南决不能获胜。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会副主席西吞·库马丹最近向巴特寮电台记者发表谈话，强烈谴责美帝国主义轰炸河内、海防的滔天罪行，重申老挝人民坚决同兄弟的越南人民并肩一起，同美帝国主义战斗到底的决心。库马丹说，美帝国主义的这一行动绝不能使越南人民屈服，相反地，只能进一步加深越南人民对它的仇恨和进行更坚决的反击。美帝国主义越是疯狂地扩大战争，它也就越接近死亡。
    日本工会总评议会所属的各工业工会二十日在全国各地分别举行集会，表示坚决支持胡志明主席的《告全国同胞书》。十九日晚上，在名古屋市约有六千五百人分别在两个地方举行集会，抗议美国扩大对越南的侵略。参加集会的人还举行了示威游行。其中有一支游行队伍的示威者，由抬着象征着约翰逊的棺材的一群人领先，在美国领事馆前高呼：“美国佬，滚回去！”
    印度西孟加拉邦的妇女七月十九日在加尔各答的美新处图书馆外面举行了一次反美示威。示威者谴责美国侵略者在越南的罪行，并且要求美国立即停止对越南北方的轰炸、从越南南方撤出全部美军。
    刚果（布）青年学生组织领导人表示支持越南人民抗美救国的英勇斗争。刚果学生总联合会主席阿杜基最近在这个联合会的第二次代表大会上作年度报告时指出：“越南人民每天都在表明，一个真正渴望自由的民族是不可战胜的，不管它是多么小。”全国革命运动青年组织执行委员会副主席贝里·马丹最近在首都举行的一次集会上谴责美帝国主义“是在世界上进行侵略的罪魁祸首”。
    墨西哥著名人士哈拉将军十八日对新华社记者发表谈话，愤怒指出，每个有正义感的人都应该起来，愤怒谴责美国约翰逊政府轰炸河内和海防的罪行。
    墨西哥经济学家阿吉拉尔·阿隆索在谴责美国侵略越南的罪行时说，没有任何力量能够阻止越南人民英勇前进，也没有任何力量能够阻止越南人民的解放斗争取得最后胜利。
    圭亚那非洲—亚洲—美洲协会二十日发表声明，对英雄的越南人民表示支持和敬意，并且要求美国和它的帮凶部队撤离越南。
    英国工人、学生和家庭妇女共五千名十七日晚上在伦敦特拉法加广场举行集会，抗议美国侵略越南。
    许多人在会上讲话，要求美军撤出越南，并表示支持坚决反对美国侵越战争的美国人民。
    新西兰许多群众二十一日在奥克兰举行示威游行，反对美国侵越战争。示威者高举“美国从越南滚出去”和“新西兰从越南滚出去”等标语牌，通过市中心，前往美国领事馆和奥克兰市政府递交一项声明，强烈抗议美国破坏日内瓦协议。
