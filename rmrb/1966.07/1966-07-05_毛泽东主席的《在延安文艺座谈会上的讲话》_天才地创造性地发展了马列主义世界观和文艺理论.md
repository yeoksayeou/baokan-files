Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" geniusly and creatively develops the Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai are jubilant and inspired as they study and discuss Mao Zedong's "Talks." They unanimously agree that the republication of the "Talks" is a major event in China's current political life, marking the entry of the Cultural Revolution into a new stage. They are determined to use the "Talks" as a weapon to thoroughly defeat the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black gang led by Zhou Yang, and to sweep away all ghosts and monsters.

The New China News Agency, Shanghai, July 4th:

The magazine "Red Flag" has republished Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," a landmark document. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai are jubilant and inspired, and are enthusiastically studying and discussing it again. They unanimously believe that the republication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," this guiding document, is a major event in China's current political life, marking the entry of the Cultural Revolution into a new stage. Chairman Mao's "Talks" are a compass, a mirror, and a battle cry. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant work, using the "Talks" as a weapon to thoroughly defeat Zhou Yang and his anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought gang of representatives of the bourgeoisie within the party, and to thoroughly uproot the black line of revisionist literature that opposes Mao Zedong's literary line, and to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

Study the "Talks" well, open fire on Zhou Yang's anti-party, anti-socialist black gang

A young worker from the Yangshupu Power Plant, Zhou Huijin, said: In the current high tide of the Cultural Revolution, the republication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," this landmark work, is a great encouragement to the revolutionary people and a heavy blow to the representatives of the bourgeoisie within the party and the bourgeois "authorities" who have long dominated China's literary and artistic circles. Chairman Mao's brilliant work is the first complete, thorough, and correct Marxist-Leninist literary line in the history of the proletarian revolution. To support the "Talks" or to oppose the "Talks" is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution. We must study Chairman Mao's "Talks" well, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, open fire on Zhou Yang's anti-party, anti-socialist black gang, and sweep away all ghosts and monsters.

A soldier from the Shanghai Garrison, "The Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," Song Hanming, said: Twenty-four years ago, Chairman Mao's "Talks" gave Zhou Yang and his gang a heavy blow, but they remained obstinate and stubbornly continued the black line of revisionism from the 1930s to the 1960s. This shows that their reactionary stance is unchangeable. The republication of Chairman Mao's "Talks" points out the main direction of the current struggle. This is to thoroughly expose and criticize Zhou Yang's revisionist literary line. Zhou Yang is the head of the black literary line of the 1930s that has long opposed Mao Zedong's literary line, and is the number one enemy of proletarian literature. Today, the republication of the "Talks" is a dagger given to us by Chairman Mao to peel off the mask of Zhou Yang, the "ancestor." With the "Talks," we have a sharp weapon to launch a general attack on the old lair of revisionist literature. The "Talks" have made us see the vital points of the class enemy, and we must fight to the death, charge forward, and thoroughly destroy the old lair of the reactionary literary line.

We will never allow Zhou Yang to distort Mao Zedong's literary line

A fine spinner from the No. 9 Cotton Mill of Shenxin, Zhao Zhenzhi, said: Chairman Mao pointed out in the "Talks": "Our literature and art are for the people, first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao's instructions on the fundamental direction of proletarian literature and art have expressed our hearts. We like those modern and revolutionary plays that perform and praise the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Such literature and art truly play the role of "uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy" as Chairman Mao said. We do not want to watch those plays that perform foreigners, ancient people, and talk about love, brother, and sister. These plays completely violate Chairman Mao's literary line. Chairman Mao said: "If you are a bourgeois literary artist, you will not praise the proletariat but praise the bourgeoisie; if you are a proletarian literary artist, you will not praise the bourgeoisie but praise the proletariat and the laboring people: one of the two must be chosen." Those represented by Zhou Yang are enthusiastic about ancient, ghost, and foreign plays, enthusiastic about praising emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, advocating the writing of "intermediate characters," they do not want modern revolutionary plays, they do not want to write about workers, peasants, and soldiers, they are bourgeois literary artists, we workers, peasants, and soldiers do not need them.

A worker-turned-cadre from the Yangshupu Power Plant, Wang Renbo, said: We workers love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao the most, and we will forever praise the Party and Chairman Mao. This is the eternal great theme of proletarian literature. The anti-party, anti-socialist black gang led by Zhou Yang, under the pretext of "opposing uniformity," shout about fighting "formulaic and conceptual tendencies," trying to exclude or even cancel the eternal great theme of praising the Party and Chairman Mao. This plot will never succeed. The Party is the core force leading our revolutionary cause, and Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, the great banner of the world's revolutionary people. Whoever opposes praising the Party and Chairman Mao is against the revolution. Chairman Mao said: "... your way is no good, the proletariat cannot yield to you, if we yield to you, it is actually yielding to the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and there is the danger of the party and the country perishing." Chairman Mao's words fully represent the will of the proletariat. Warning Zhou Yang and his gang: we workers, peasants, and soldiers will never yield to you, we will forever praise the great Party, praise the great leader Chairman Mao, praise the great invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Now it is like this, in a hundred years it will be like this, in a thousand years it will also be like this, forever it will be like this.

A young worker from the Yangshupu Power Plant, Zhou Huijin, said: Chairman Mao said: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line. Art for art's sake, classless art, and art that is parallel or independent of politics, actually do not exist." The bourgeois literary "authorities" represented by Zhou Yang talk nonsense about "socialist culture" being "national culture," advocating that "all the people are the objects of service," this is all deceitful nonsense. In fact, in a class society, "national culture" does not exist. In the past, landlords and bourgeoisie have never loved us, never praised us; now the representatives of the bourgeoisie in the literary and artistic circles, the bourgeois "authorities," have always praised landlords and bourgeoisie, never praised us, instead, in their works, they either defame and slander us workers, peasants, and soldiers, or spread the poison of the bourgeois and feudal classes, trying to anesthetize and poison us. What kind of tree blooms what kind of flower, what class speaks what words. Zhou Yang advocates "national culture," this is a barefaced opposition to Chairman Mao's literary line of "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers," we will not agree!

Workers, peasants, and soldiers must become the masters of socialist literature and art

A worker from the Shanghai Shipyard, Ju Yousong, said: Chairman Mao said: "To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the army with guns in their hands. But having only such an army is not enough, we must also have a cultural army, which is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." Chairman Mao's words are absolutely true. Now we have a solid proletarian dictatorship and a powerful army, but for a long time, the bourgeois "authorities" have still occupied our proletarian cultural positions, turning literature and art into tools for restoring capitalism. Therefore, we workers, peasants, and soldiers must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, take up the pen ourselves and step onto the literary and artistic stage to fight against them head-on. This is a big issue related to whether the Cultural Revolution can achieve a thorough victory and whether socialism can be built and transitioned to communism. We workers, peasants, and soldiers must become the masters of culture, and we workers, peasants, and soldiers can definitely become the masters of culture. Chairman Mao said in the "Talks" that people's lives are the inexhaustible and boundless source of all literature and art. We are the practitioners of the three great revolutionary movements, and we workers, peasants, and soldiers have the most favorable conditions to create literary and artistic works that reflect workers, peasants, and soldiers. I took off my illiteracy hat in 1958 and started writing poems in 1959. I am a fireworker, specializing in heating and flattening steel plates for shipbuilding, our work is very hard and important, but those bourgeois "poets" never put us in their eyes, never wrote poems praising us fireworkers. I decided to write myself. Thus, in 1959, I wrote my first poem in my life: "Fearless of heaven, fearless of earth, we fireworkers are full of vigor, wielding big hammers to shake the sky, sweat nourishes the ship to grow big." My fellow workers were very happy, saying: "Great! We are full of energy after reading it!" In the past few years, I have already written nearly 300 poems. The bourgeois literary "ancestors" and "elders" represented by Zhou Yang hate us workers stepping onto the literary and artistic stage to the core, they on the one hand praise the bourgeois literary "authorities" and "writers," on the other hand try every means to strike us, or try every means to "transform" us. Some say my poems are copied. Some threaten me, saying: "Your few folk songs are nothing, the poetry collection of a certain great 'poet' can crush you to death." Some "advise" me to learn ancient and foreign poetry, some even directly "pull" me "out" of the factory to "expand my horizons," "experience life," and want me to write "beautiful lyrical poems," nonsense about "working in the factory every day is too monotonous, the tune is old, and good poems cannot be written." In a word, these bourgeois "authorities" want me to roll into their mud pit. I will definitely use Chairman Mao's "Talks" as a weapon, despise all bourgeois literary "authorities," seize their power, occupy all cultural positions, and charge forward to establish proletarian literature.

A soldier from the Shanghai Garrison, "The Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," Song Hanming, said: In the more than ten years since liberation, the representatives of the bourgeoisie in the literary and artistic circles, the bourgeois "authorities" led by Zhou Yang, have made the literary and artistic circles chaotic. Practice has proven that these people are all stubborn and incurable, and are the mortal enemies of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We workers, peasants, and soldiers have never had any illusions about these bourgeois "ancestors" and "elders," and have no hope that they will "create" for us workers, peasants, and soldiers, "serve" us workers, peasants, and soldiers, or "praise" us. The revolution requires us workers, peasants, and soldiers to take up the pen ourselves and stride onto the literary and artistic stage. We are heroes on the battlefield and must also be the main force on the literary and artistic stage.

A part-time storyteller from Xiaozheng Commune, Qingpu County, Lü Yanhua, said: Chairman Mao pointed out in the "Talks": "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." Therefore, the "pen" has the problem of "who holds it," "for whom it is held," and "what it is held for." Modern revisionism in the Soviet Union is the vanguard of the demons and monsters who hold the "pen." Now Zhou Yang, Deng Tuo, and the like are also using the "pen" to oppose the party, oppose socialism, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought. We must make the "pen" listen to the party's command, listen to Chairman Mao's command. To make the "pen" listen to the party and Chairman Mao, the most important thing is for us workers, peasants, and soldiers to firmly hold the "pen," because we workers, peasants, and soldiers listen to the party the most, listen to Chairman Mao the most. In recent years, under the party's education and cultivation, I have striven to take Chairman Mao's "Talks" as the highest instruction for carrying out the activity of telling revolutionary stories, and actively participated in labor. I have told nearly 100 revolutionary stories. In recent years, I have armed myself with Chairman Mao's thought, broken superstitions, and created and compiled revolutionary stories such as "Mother and Daughter," "The Battle of Baozhai Bay," "The Daughter of the Squad Leader," "A Key," and "Three Boats" to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and praise poor and lower-middle peasants, which have been welcomed by poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao pointed out in the "Talks": "All revolutionary literary and artistic workers must connect with the masses, represent the masses, and regard themselves as faithful spokesmen of the masses. Only then will their work have meaning." This is the criterion for us workers, peasants, and soldiers to engage in literary creation. I will definitely act according to Chairman Mao's instruction and make the greatest contribution to occupying and consolidating the socialist cultural positions in rural areas.

Carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end

Lü Yanhua said: After studying Chairman Mao's "Talks" again, looking back at the class struggle in the cultural field in recent years, it is even clearer that this is essentially a struggle for power. In the countryside, we tell revolutionary stories, and the remnants of feudalism and capitalism in the countryside also use some old artists to occupy teahouses and bookstages to spread poison. They do this to carry out spiritual sabotage and prepare public opinion for counter-revolutionary restoration in the countryside. In response to the rampant activities of the class enemy, we use Chairman Mao's "Talks" as a weapon to fight against these demons and monsters head-on. One day, I passed by the teahouse and saw an old artist inside telling the story of "Tang Bohu Dian Qiu Xiang," this bad story that praises the landlord class's debauchery with women, singing the opposite of socialist ideology. I thought: I must use revolutionary stories to suppress him. I stepped into the teahouse, stood on the long bench, and started telling the revolutionary story "The Red Lantern." Many listeners said: "Li Nanniang, Li Yuhe, and Li Tieying are indeed heroes; Tang Bohu thinks about women all day, only landlord bandits do such shameful things, don't listen to his in the future." In this way, we fought against the remnants of capitalism and feudalism in the countryside in a sharp struggle. They sing black, I sing red; they praise the landlord, I praise the poor and lower-middle peasants. I rely on Mao Zedong Thought, I rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, so the struggle wins victory after victory. Teahouses, fields, and evening gatherings have all been taken over by us and become important positions for propagating Mao Zedong Thought and telling revolutionary stories, greatly boosting the morale of the poor and lower-middle peasants and crushing the arrogance of the class enemy. The party teaches us: storytellers are propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, telling stories is doing revolution. We must use revolutionary stories to occupy the ideological and cultural positions in the countryside.

A worker-turned-cadre from the No. 9 Cotton Mill of Shenxin, Wu Nianxiu, said: Chairman Mao said in the "Talks": "Literature and art are subordinate to politics, but they in turn exert a great influence on politics." Linking this to the current Cultural Revolution, rereading Chairman Mao's instruction, I feel even more enlightened. The cultural position, if the proletariat does not occupy, the bourgeoisie will definitely occupy. A person influenced by revolutionary literature and art can become more revolutionary; a person influenced by bourgeois literature and art will become non-revolutionary or even counter-revolutionary. Our factory has young workers and children of workers who have been poisoned unknowingly by watching bad books, bad plays, and bad movies and have changed their nature. Zhou Yang and his gang of representatives of the bourgeoisie say that works can have "no political content," advocating so-called "harmless" works of "entertainment," saying that literature and art are "spiritual enjoyment." This is completely to make us give up the cultural position and allow bourgeois ideology to spread freely. We will not agree. In this Cultural Revolution, we must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly seize all cultural positions, and eliminate the influence of all reactionary thoughts of the bourgeoisie and others.

A worker-turned-cadre from the Yangshupu Power Plant, Wang Renbo, said: After studying Chairman Mao's "Talks" again, I love Chairman Mao, the Party, and Mao Zedong Thought even more. We broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers can only distinguish right from wrong and sweep away all demons and monsters after mastering Mao Zedong Thought. To uproot a tree, you must uproot its roots; to catch a thief, you must catch the ringleader. No matter how great Zhou Yang's gang's "authority" is, how old their credentials are, or how high their positions are, as long as they oppose the great Mao Zedong Thought, we workers, peasants, and soldiers will fight to the death with them, shedding our heads and blood, and will not rest until we thoroughly defeat them!

    毛泽东主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》  天才地创造性地发展了马列主义世界观和文艺理论
    上海广大工农兵欢欣鼓舞学习和座谈《讲话》，一致认为重新发表《讲话》是当前我国政治生活中的一件大事，标志着无产阶级文化大革命进入新阶段，决心以《讲话》为武器，彻底打倒周扬一伙反党反社会主义黑帮，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神
    新华社上海四日电　《红旗》杂志重新发表毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这部划时代的重要文献，上海广大工农兵群众欢欣鼓舞，纷纷重新学习和座谈。他们一致认为：重新发表毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这一纲领性文献，是当前我国政治生活中的一件大事，标志着无产阶级文化大革命又进入了一个新的阶段。毛主席这个《讲话》是指南针，是照妖镜，是进军号。我们一定要活学活用毛主席的这一光辉著作，以毛主席的《讲话》为武器，彻底打倒周扬一伙反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的党内资产阶级代表人物和资产阶级“权威”，彻底铲除他们这条同毛泽东文艺路线相对立的修正主义文艺黑线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    学好《讲话》，向周扬一伙反党反社会主义黑帮开火
    上海杨树浦发电厂青年工人周惠金说：在当前无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，重新发表毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这篇划时代的著作，这是对革命人民的极大鼓舞，是对长期以来盘踞在我国文艺界的党内资产阶级代表人物和资产阶级“权威”的沉重打击。毛主席的这篇光辉的著作，是无产阶级革命历史上第一次提出的最完整、最彻底、最正确的马克思列宁主义文艺路线。拥护这个《讲话》，还是反对这个《讲话》，是革命和反革命的分水岭。我们要学好毛主席的这篇《讲话》，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向周扬一伙反党反社会主义黑帮开火，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。
    上海警备区某部、“南京路上好八连”战士宋捍中说：二十四年前，毛主席的《讲话》给周扬这帮人当头一棒，但是他们仍然执迷不悟，顽固地把修正主义的黑线从三十年代贯到六十年代。这证明他们的反动立场是不可改变的。重新发表毛主席的《讲话》，指出了当前斗争的主攻方向。这就是必须彻底揭露、彻底批判周扬的修正主义文艺路线。周扬就是几十年来与毛泽东文艺路线相对立的三十年代文艺黑线的头子，是无产阶级文艺的头号敌人。今天重新发表《讲话》，这是毛主席交给我们的一把剥开周扬这个“祖师爷”画皮的匕首，有了《讲话》就有了向修正主义文艺老巢发动总攻的锐利武器。《讲话》使我们看清了阶级敌人的要害，我们一定要刺刀见红，猛打猛冲，彻底摧毁反动文艺黑线的老巢。
    决不允许周扬篡改毛主席的文艺路线
    申新第九棉纺织厂细纱车间挡车工赵珍娣说：毛主席在《讲话》中指出：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”毛主席对无产阶级文学艺术根本方向的这些指示，正说出了我们的心里话。我们就是喜欢那些演工农兵、歌颂工农兵的现代戏、革命戏。这样的文艺才真正起到了毛主席所说的“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的作用。我们就是不要看那些演洋人，演古人，谈情说爱，整天哥哥妹妹的戏，这些戏根本违背了毛主席的文艺路线。毛主席说：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”以周扬为代表的那些人，热心古戏、鬼戏、洋戏，热心歌颂帝王将相、才子佳人，提倡写“中间人物”，他们就是不要现代革命戏，就是不肯写工农兵，他们就是资产阶级文艺家，我们工农兵不需要他们。
    杨树浦发电厂工人出身的干部王仁波说：我们工人最热爱共产党、最热爱毛主席，我们要永远歌颂党、歌颂毛主席，这是无产阶级文艺永恒的伟大主题。周扬这伙反党反社会主义的黑帮分子，以“反对千篇一律”为幌子，叫嚷要向“公式化、概念化倾向作斗争”，妄想排斥以至取消歌颂党、歌颂毛主席这个永恒的伟大主题。这个阴谋是绝对不能得逞的。党是领导我们革命事业的核心力量，毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，是世界革命人民的伟大旗手。谁反对歌颂党和毛主席，就是反对革命。毛主席说：“……你们那一套是不行的，无产阶级是不能迁就你们的，依了你们，实际上就是依了大地主大资产阶级，就有亡党亡国的危险。”毛主席的这些话，完全代表了我们无产阶级的意志。警告周扬一伙：我们工农兵决不会依你们，我们要永远歌颂伟大的党，歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席，歌颂伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。现在是这样，一百年是这样，一千年也是这样，永远是这样。
    杨树浦发电厂的青年工人周惠金说：毛主席说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。”以周扬为代表的资产阶级文艺“权威”胡说什么社会主义的文化是“全民文化”，鼓吹“全国人民都是服务的对象”，这完全是骗人的大鬼话。事实上，在阶级社会里“全民的文化”根本不存在。过去地主、资产阶级从来没有爱过我们，从来没有歌颂过我们；现在文艺界的资产阶级代表人物，资产阶级“权威”，也一直是吹捧地主、资产阶级，从来没有歌颂我们，相反，在他们作品里不是丑化诬蔑我们工农兵，就是散布资产阶级封建阶级的毒素，妄想麻醉和毒害我们。啥树开啥花，啥阶级说啥话。周扬鼓吹“全民文化”，这是明目张胆地反对毛主席的“为工农兵服务”的文艺路线，我们决不答应！
    工农兵一定要成为社会主义文艺的主人
    上海沪东造船厂工人居有松说：毛主席说：“我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”毛主席的话真是千真万确。现在我们有巩固的无产阶级政权，有强大的军队，但是长期以来，资产阶级“权威”还是霸占着我们无产阶级的文化阵地，他们把文化艺术变成了复辟资本主义的工具。因此，我们工农兵一定要响应毛主席的伟大号召，自己拿起笔杆登上文艺舞台，和他们展开针锋相对的斗争。这是关系到无产阶级文化大革命能不能取得彻底胜利、能不能建成社会主义并过渡到共产主义的大问题。我们工农兵必须做文化的主人，我们工农兵也一定能做文化的主人。毛主席在《讲话》中早就说过，人民生活是一切文学艺术的取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一源泉。我们是三大革命运动的实践者，我们工农兵自己来创作反映工农兵的文艺作品，条件比任何人都有利。我在一九五八年摘掉文盲帽子，一九五九年就开始写诗。我是个火工，专门管把造船用的钢板烘平，我们工作很艰苦很重要，但是那些资产阶级“诗人”根本不把我们放在眼里，从来不写歌颂我们火工的诗。我就下决心自己写。这样，一九五九年就写下了我生平的第一首诗：“天不怕，地不怕，我们火工干劲大，挥舞大锤震天动，汗水喂得船长大。”工人同志们看了真高兴，都说：好极了，我们看了浑身是劲！几年来我已经写了近三百首诗。以周扬为代表的这些资产阶级文艺“祖师爷”、“老头子”对我们工人登上文艺舞台恨之入骨，他们一面大肆吹捧资产阶级的文艺“权威”、“作家”，一面想尽办法来打击我们，或者用尽办法“演变”我们。他们有的说我的诗是抄来的。有的恐吓我说：“你几首民歌算得什么，某某大‘诗人’的诗集多得可以把你压死。”有的“劝导”我要学古典和外国的诗，有的甚至干脆“拉”我“走出”厂外“扩大眼界”，“体验生活”，要我写“优美的抒情诗”，胡说什么“一天到晚在工厂，太枯燥，调子老了，写不出好诗。”一句话，这些资产阶级“权威”是想要我滚到他们的泥坑里去。我一定要以毛主席《讲话》为武器，蔑视一切资产阶级文艺“权威”，夺他们的权，占领一切文化阵地，为创立无产阶级文艺冲锋陷阵。
    上海警备区某部、“南京路上好八连”战士宋捍中说：解放后十多年来，以周扬为首领的文艺界资产阶级代表人物、资产阶级“权威”，把文艺界搞得乌烟瘴气。实践证明，这些人都是些顽固不化，不可救药的人，是工农兵的死对头。我们工农兵，对这些资产阶级“老头子”、“祖师爷”从来不抱任何幻想，丝毫不指望他们为我们工农兵“创作”，为我们工农兵“服务”，丝毫不指望他们来“歌颂”我们。革命要求我们工农兵自己拿起笔杆，大踏步登上文艺舞台。我们在战场上是杀敌英雄，也要做文艺舞台上的主力军。
    青浦县小蒸公社业余故事员吕燕华说：毛主席在《讲话》中指出：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”所以“笔杆子”有个“谁来摇”，“为谁摇”和“摇什么”的大问题。苏联出了现代修正主义，就是那“摇笔杆子”的牛鬼蛇神打的先锋；周扬、邓拓之流现在也是借“摇笔杆子”来反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想。我们一定要叫“笔杆子”听党的指挥，听毛主席的指挥。要“笔杆子”听党和毛主席的指挥，最重要的就是我们工农兵自己要抓牢笔杆子，因为我们工农兵最听党的话，最听毛主席的话。这几年来，我在党的教育培养下，努力把毛主席的《讲话》当做开展讲革命故事活动的最高指示，同时积极参加劳动，我讲了近百个革命故事。这几年，我用毛主席的思想武装头脑，破除迷信，自己创作编写了宣传毛泽东思想，歌颂贫下中农的《母女会》、《豹子湾战斗》、《队长的女儿》、《一把钥匙》以及《三只船》等革命故事，受到了贫下中农的欢迎。毛主席在《讲话》中指出：“一切革命的文学家艺术家只有联系群众，表现群众，把自己当作群众的忠实的代言人，他们的工作才有意义。”这是我们工农兵从事文艺创作的准则。我一定按照毛主席的这个指示办事，为占领和巩固农村社会主义文化阵地作出最大的贡献。
    把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    吕燕华说：重新学习了毛主席的《讲话》，再回顾这几年农村文化领域的阶级斗争，就更清楚地认识到这实质上是一场夺权斗争。我们在农村大讲革命故事，农村的封建主义、资本主义残余势力，也利用一些旧艺人，霸占了茶馆、书场来放毒。他们这样做就是搞精神颠覆，为在农村搞反革命复辟作舆论准备。针对阶级敌人的猖狂活动，我们用毛主席的《讲话》作武器，同这些牛鬼蛇神展开了针锋相对的斗争。有一天，我走过茶馆门口，看到一个旧艺人正在里面大讲《唐伯虎点秋香》，这个宣扬地主阶级玩弄女性的坏故事，同社会主义思想大唱反调。我就想：一定要用革命故事去压倒他。我一脚跨进茶馆，往长凳上一站，向大家讲起革命故事《红灯记》来。许多听众都说：“人家李奶奶、李玉和、铁梅真是英雄；唐伯虎一天到晚想女人，只有地主坏蛋才干这种丑事，以后不要听他的。”就这样，我们在农村和资本主义、封建主义残余势力展开了尖锐的斗争。他们唱黑的，我说红的；他们捧地主老爷，我赞贫下中农。我靠的是毛泽东思想，靠的是贫下中农，所以斗争节节取得胜利。茶馆、田头、纳凉晚会都被我们夺了过来，成了宣传毛泽东思想、讲革命故事的重要阵地，大大长了贫下中农的志气，灭了阶级敌人的威风。党教导我们：故事员是毛泽东思想的宣传员，讲故事是干革命。我们就是要用革命故事去占领农村思想文化阵地。
    申新第九棉纺织厂工人出身的干部吴年秀说：毛主席在《讲话》中说：“文艺是从属于政治的，但又反转来给予伟大的影响于政治。”联系当前的文化大革命，重读毛主席的这一教导，更感到心明眼亮。文化这个阵地无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就一定去占领。一个人受革命文艺影响，可以变得更加革命；一个人受资产阶级文艺影响，就会变成不革命以至反革命。我们厂就有青年工人、工人子弟，看了坏书、坏戏、坏电影，不知不觉地中毒变了质。周扬等一伙资产阶级代表人物说什么作品可以“没有政治内容”，鼓吹所谓“无益无害”的“娱乐性”作品，说什么文艺是“愉悦精神”的。这完全是要我们放弃文化阵地，听任资产阶级思想自由泛滥。我们决不答应。在这次文化大革命中，我们一定要按毛主席的指示办事，坚决夺回一切文化阵地，肃清资产阶级等一切反动思想的影响。
    杨树浦发电厂工人出身的干部王仁波说：重新学习了毛主席的《讲话》，我更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱党，更加热爱毛泽东思想。我们广大工农兵，革命群众只有掌握了毛泽东思想，才能明辨是非，才能横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。拔树要拔根，擒贼先擒王，不管周扬这帮家伙“权威”多大、资格多老、地位多高，只要他反对伟大的毛泽东思想，我们工农兵就是抛头颅，洒热血，也要和他们斗争到底，不把他们彻底打垮，誓不罢休！
