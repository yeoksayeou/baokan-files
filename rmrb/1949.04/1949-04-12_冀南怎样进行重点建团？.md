How to Focus on Building the Communist Youth League in Southern Hebei?
    Xinhua News Agency Jinnan Branch

    From January to March, the Second Special District established eleven CYL branches in rural areas and schools in counties such as Xiajin and Qinghe, developing 180 CYL members. The Fourth Special District established ten CYL branches in factories, rural areas, and schools in counties such as Nangong, Guangzong, and Julu, with 248 CYL members. Since the establishment of the CYL in Linzhang in February, the entire county has established five CYL branches and thirteen CYL groups, with 58 male and female CYL members.

    The establishment of these CYL branches was carried out under the personal leadership of the Youth League Committee at all levels or the responsible comrades of each unit, in conjunction with production, study, and other work. The Nangong Municipal State-owned Huachang Weaving Factory has 71 employees, including 36 young people. The general branch first organized a preparatory committee, convened branch meetings and workers' meetings, and conducted individual interviews to widely publicize the significance of building the CYL from within the Party to outside, and repeatedly explained the benefits of building the CYL for young people, dispelling individual concerns about being called up for military service, or the mistaken view that it was just to get them to work more. Young workers actively produced in order to strive to become CYL members, and studied even more actively. Under the influence of more than half of the young workers, the labor enthusiasm of all workers also increased. For example, first-class workers who previously wove six zhang of cloth per day now weave seven zhang, and the quality of other groups has also improved. During study time, they automatically went to the classroom without waiting for the whistle. After nearly two months of preparation, many activists emerged and voluntarily requested to join the CYL. The preparatory committee approved 18 CYL members in accordance with the provisions of the CYL Charter and then established a CYL branch. Nangong Middle School has a total of 346 young students, and developed 89 CYL members through study competitions. In Liulimiao Village, Nangong Second District, the bad habits of young people such as catching pigeons, gambling, and fighting were corrected by guiding young people in production, and 15 CYL members were developed. The above, combined with the current local work, and building the CYL after sufficient and organized preparation, became a lively and solid youth organization and played a positive role in various tasks, winning the support and praise of the masses inside and outside the CYL.

    Some places divorced themselves from the central work and built the CYL in isolation, or did not prepare adequately, resulting in forced recruitment, making the organization formalistic and declining. For example, the CYL building in Julu Normal School lacked leadership and was not closely integrated with learning, and it set its own CYL charter. As a result, 32 CYL members were developed, but the general mood was not high. The Cao Kou Village branch in Qinghe abandoned leadership and simply handed over the CYL building to Party members, resulting in many deviations.

    Experience has proven that building the CYL must be under the direct leadership of the Party Committee at all levels, combined with the current local work, widely publicized, and prepared adequately; at the same time, it must follow the procedures for joining the CYL as stipulated in the CYL Charter, correctly grasp the conditions for joining the CYL, adopt the method of individual absorption and gradual development, and rely on the Party's young Party members as the backbone of the CYL building, in order to do a good job in the CYL building.

　　冀南怎样进行重点建团？
    新华社冀南分社
    自一月至三月份，二专区在夏津、清河等县的农村和学校建立了十一个团支部，发展了团员一百八十人。四专区在南宫、广宗、钜鹿等县的工厂、农村、学校建立了十个团支部，团员二百四十八人。临漳自二月份建团以来，全县建立了五个团支部，十三个团小组，男女团员五十八人。
    这些团支部的建立，是在各级青委或各单位负责同志亲自领导下结合生产、学习等工作进行的。南宫市公营华昌职工厂，共有职工七十一人，其中青年三十六名。首由总支组织筹委会，召开支部大会、工人会、进行个别谈话等方式，由党内到党外广泛宣传建团的意义，并反复解释建团对青年的好处，打破了个别人怕叫参军的顾虑，或认为反正是为了多叫干活的错误观点。青年工人都为争取能做个团员而积极生产，并更加积极学习，在半数以上青年工人影响下，全体工人的劳动热忱也提高。如甲等工人已往每人每天织布六丈，现增至七丈，其它各组质量也均有提高。在学习时不等吹哨子就自动去课堂。经过近两个月的酝酿，涌现了不少的积极分子，自动要求入团。筹委会按照团章规定批准十八名团员后即建立团支部。南宫中学共有青年学生三百四十六人，从学习竞赛中，发展团员八十九人。南宫二区琉璃庙村通过引导青年生产纠正青年捉鸽子、赌博、打击等恶习，发展团员十五名等等。以上结合当前当地工作，经过有领导的充分酝酿建团，成为活泼巩固的青年组织并且发挥了青年在各种工作中的积极作用，博得团内外群众的拥护和赞助。
    有的地方离开中心工作孤立建团，或未酝酿成熟，形成拉夫，使组织流为形式而消沉。如钜鹿简师建团缺乏领导，也未与学习密切结合，自定团章，结果发展团员三十二名，普遍情绪不高。清河草口村支部放弃领导，把建团只是交给党员去作，出了不少偏差等等。
    经验证明：建团必须在各级党委的直接领导下，结合当前当地工作，普遍进行宣传，酝酿成熟；同时必须依照团章规定之入团手续，正确掌握入团条件，采取个别吸收，逐渐发展的方法，依靠党的青年党员作为建团骨干，方可把建团工作作好。
