　　Eight Hundred Workers Flee Taiyuan
　　People's Government Resettles Them Separately
　　[Taiyuan News] A large number of workers in Taiyuan, unable to bear the frenzied persecution and oppression of the Yan bandit gang in its death throes, have fled the city one after another, seeking the People's Liberation Army. In order to solve the difficulties of the fleeing workers, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government and the North China Federation of Trade Unions established a "Taiyuan Municipal Production Self-Salvation Committee" in Yuci City on the 12th of last month, under which a worker reception center was set up. From its establishment to the 27th of last month, the reception center handled and registered a total of 836 workers and 477 family members of workers (including most of the factories and units in Taiyuan). The methods of handling included sending them home, enrolling them in training classes, and organizing production for self-salvation. The escaped workers were quite satisfied. Yang Shuqiao, a worker from the repair shop, said: "Escaping from the tiger's mouth, we have seen the clear sky." Zhou Changtai and other workers from factory X said: "Having come to the liberated area, the comrades treat us like relatives. They even give us travel expenses to go home. After entering Taiyuan, we must work hard to boost production." (Yuan Bu, Qing Shu, Zhu Leng)

　　八百职工逃出太原
  　人民政府分别安置
    【太原讯】太原市大批工人群众，不堪阎匪在垂死挣扎中的疯狂迫害与压榨，纷纷逃出城外，寻找人民解放军。我太原市人民政府与华北职工总会为了解决逃出职工的困难，特于上月十二日在榆次市成立了一个“太原市生产自救委员会”，下设职工招待所。招待所自成立至上月二十七日半月中，处理及登记职工共八百三十六名，厂工家属四百七十七名（包括了太原市大部工厂单位）。处理办法有遣送回家，入训练班及组织生产自救等。逃出的职工都相当满意，修造厂工人杨树桥说：“逃出虎口来，见了晴天了。”×厂工人周长太等说：“来到解放区，同志们相待跟亲人一样，回家还给路费，进了太原后，一定要好好加油生产。”（元布、青书、朱冷）
