　　Our Own Troops Have Arrived!
　　Nanjing Workers, Students, and Citizens Warmly Welcome Our Army into the City
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 25th (Delayed Dispatch): At dawn on the 24th, in a light river mist, this reporter accompanied a unit of the People's Liberation Army across the Yangtze River from Pukou, entering Nanjing, which yesterday was still the base of the counter-revolutionaries but today is a people's city. As soon as we landed on the south bank, workers from the Jiangnan Automobile Company, in vehicles plastered with slogans like "Our Own Troops Have Arrived!" and "Welcome the PLA to Liberate Nanjing!" drove up from the crowds to the riverbank to welcome us. Some waved to us and said, "Comrades, you've worked hard!" As the PLA troops galloped towards the city, the sound of firecrackers was continuous. Groups of poorly dressed urban poor and coolies, liberated from the oppression of the ruling class, watched their own PLA come towards them, their eyes narrowed with joy, standing on the streets and in the alleys to welcome them. The crowd grew larger and larger, pressing in from both sides of the street towards the middle, squeezing the PLA's three advancing columns into one. Their affectionate expressions were like those of children seeing their long-separated mother, instinctively wanting to embrace her. On the streets, roads, and at Municipal Middle School, Drama School, and Zhongda (Central University), students excitedly shouted along the streets: "Welcome the PLA into the city!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Down with Chiang Kai-shek!" The slogans resounded endlessly, shaking the streets. Slogans and cartoons demanding that the PLA fight to Guangzhou and Taiwan, capture Chiang Kai-shek and other war criminals, punish the murderers of students in the Nanjing Massacre, and completely eliminate the reactionary forces were plastered all over the streets and alleys.

　　我们自己的队伍来了！
  　南京工人学生市民热烈欢迎我军入城
    【新华社南京二十五日电】（迟到）二十四日拂晓，江雾微蒙，记者随人民解放军某部由浦口渡江，进入昨天还是反革命的大本营，今天已是人民城市的南京。刚登上南岸，江南汽车公司的工人们，便乘着贴了“我们自己的队伍来了！”“欢迎解放军解放南京！”等标语的汽车，一列列从人丛里开到江边欢迎。有的向我们招手说：“同志们，辛苦了！”当解放军人马奔腾地向城区前进的时候，鞭炮的声音连续不绝，成群的穿着破旧衣服的城市贫民和苦力，从统治阶级的压迫下解放出来，看着自己的解放军迎面过来，两眼喜成了一条缝，站在街头巷尾夹道欢迎。人群越来越多，由街道的两旁紧紧向街的中间靠拢，将解放军三路前进的行列挤得缩成了一路。他们那种亲热的表情，就象孩子见了久别的母亲，本能地要搂抱一下。在街头上、马路上、市立中学、剧专、中大的学生们，沿街兴奋地呼着：“欢迎解放军进城！”“毛主席万岁！”“打倒蒋介石！”的口号。口号声经久不绝，震撼着街道。要求解放军打到广州、台湾，捉拿蒋介石为首的战争罪犯，惩办南京惨案屠杀学生的凶手，彻底消灭反动势力的标语、漫画，在大街小巷贴满着。
