Fighting the Flood
　　--A Record of Female River Management Engineer Qian Zhengying
    Liu Baiyu

    Qian Zhengying is the first female engineer to participate in the fight against the raging floods of the Huai River, the Grand Canal, and the Yellow River, and to achieve brilliant results. But she told me: "As a female engineer, it was just a dream in the old society."

    Her father returned from the United States after studying hydraulic engineering. He loved his daughter and placed his ideals in her. In the summer of 1936, when he was in charge of the Han River levee project, he suddenly summoned his daughter to his side. She will always remember—it was such a gloomy summer because the engineering director who preceded her father was shot by the Kuomintang government due to the river's breach, using an engineer's blood to cover up the Kuomintang government's own corruption, waste of engineering sins. ...Was this the way out for Chinese engineering!?

    Later, although she continued to study hydraulic engineering in Shanghai, and although the phantoms of Soviet female engineers often appeared in her mind, the deepening darkness intensified her thinking. She knew that the evil old society would not allow a woman to develop properly. She thought heavily: "If scientists climb trees to pick fruit, but the base of the tree is full of privileged people, what is the point!" From then on, she ended her dreams in the old society, and she firmly decided: "Now let me destroy the old society first!" Qian Zhengying became a member of the Chinese Communist Party in 1941. At that time, she enthusiastically devoted herself to secret work. She waited for the day when she could shed her blood on the land in an uprising, so that huge projects could be erected on this land in the future!

    In 1942, because she had attracted the attention of the enemy in Shanghai, she was ordered by the Party to retreat from Shanghai to the Huaibei guerrilla area. At that time, the Party leadership in Huaibei was facing a serious river management problem. The Party discovered Qian Zhengying and transferred her to the post of building the Huai River levee. As an engineer, Qian Zhengying did not stand idly by but worked with everyone to measure earthwork, calculate earthwork, and determine wages. From the Huai River project, Qian Zhengying understood: "Engineering is a struggle with nature, but engineering itself has class character." The Huai River project was under the leadership of the Communist Party, which made everything different. The enthusiasm of the masses was mobilized, and countless red flags of competition fluttered on the levee day and night. This was an inexhaustible force. Organizing and helping this force could overcome everything. After the completion of the Huai River project, the Party transferred Qian Zhengying to "rectification," where she learned correct thinking methods. This decided that later, she would go deep into the masses in the Huaibei area to investigate and research, and complete a large project of "Baoying Lake Survey." However, Qian Zhengying still encountered several failures in her practical work. It was from these failures that she learned and accumulated experience, and she continued to devote herself to greater people's engineering undertakings.

    In 1946, the Central China Bureau resolutely built a levee along the banks of the Grand Canal, which ran for more than two hundred miles across the Liberated Area. At that time, it was after the seven consecutive victories in northern Jiangsu, and the war had developed to the Grand Canal—gunfire was often heard nearby, planes were bombing every day, and the southern front of Central China was in fierce fighting...Whether the levee broke or not was related to the success or failure of the overall situation in Central China. This time, Qian Zhengying was appointed deputy director of the southern section of the engineering office. The autumn flood finally came, and the water rose sharply—the water level of Gaoyou Lake rose to one zhang, seven chi, and four cun (this was a terrible phenomenon second only to the disaster of the tenth year of the Republic of China). On the morning of September 17th, a storm suddenly arose on the hundred-li lake surface along Gaoyou Lake, and huge waves rushed towards the levee like an avalanche. It wanted to smash this levee and roar and run wild towards the sea. At this time, nearly 10,000 people along the river rushed to the levee. They used sacks to fill stones, fight against dangers, drive piles, and hang trees, rushing to repair wherever there was a collapse. Qian Zhengying and everyone else, soaked in the water, fought for two days and nights, and this great thriller gradually calmed down. In early October, after fierce fighting, the Central China troops made a strategic shift to the north, and Qian Zhengying bid farewell to the Grand Canal, crossing the Longhai Railway to Shandong on January 13, 1947.

    Qian Zhengying also accepted the tempering of the flames of war. She completed a project on the front line to ensure the transportation of vehicles during the rainy season. For the sake of victory, in the cold early morning of February, braving the ice in the water, she and the laborers jumped into the water to build a bridge, but in the end, the heavy rain prevented her from finding a pinch of dry soil to pave the road, and the situation on the front line was very urgent, and the road became a mud pond. What should be done? She jumped into the mud, raised her arms, and shouted, leading everyone to push truck after truck to the front, to the front, so that our troops could attack the enemy. She persisted in this difficult position for a year until the Chen Su troops went south across the Yellow River to support the Liu Deng troops in advancing into the Central Plains. Only then did she remain in the Bohai area.

    In the Bohai area, Qian Zhengying encountered the most difficult-to-manage Yellow River in Chinese history. The tragic impression of the Yellow River flood has remained in the minds of the working people of northern China for many years. Qian Zhengying began her battle with the Yellow River here. But who knew that the most serious ice jam in decades would break out in early 1948—the weather upstream warmed and the ice melted, and countless ice blocks rushed down, but the weather downstream was cold and had not yet thawed, and the ice accumulated on the river like huge mountains, blocking the water flow. As a result, the Yellow River became terribly violent and flooded horizontally. At that time, the people along the river were disappointed with the Yellow River. On New Year's Eve, there was a sound of gongs warning on the Yellow River embankment. The people took off their cotton clothes and hugged their cotton quilts to rush to block the cracks in the embankment. Finally, a large amount of explosives was used to blast a path from the Yellow River ice jam, subduing the terrible Yellow River ice jam.

    Immediately following was the spring repair of the Yellow River. The old Yellow River project had been destroyed by the Japanese and damaged by Chiang Kai-shek, and it was in disrepair. At this time, under the leadership of the Party in the Bohai area, a Yellow River Management Headquarters was formed, with Wang Zhuoru, Jiang Yankun, and Qian Zhengying serving as the chief and deputy commanders to build this vast project. But an extremely difficult problem was the lack of materials. The banks of the Yellow River were a barren desert. In the past, stones were transported from Jinan, but at that time, Jinan was controlled by the enemy, who not only did not provide stones but also opened fire and attacked the engineering personnel on this bank. Without materials, how could this Yellow River project be repaired? But Qian Zhengying told me with a smile:

    "As long as you stand with the masses, you will have infinite strength."

    Facts proved this to be true. Many miracles in the Liberated Areas appeared in this way, and the new China also appeared in this way. After the Party's call, the people of Bohai launched an enthusiastic movement to donate bricks and stones. They said, "Smash the monuments to control the Yellow River and protect our homes." People came in an endless stream, rushing to the Yellow River. There were veterans who had come from 500 li away, and countless women and children carried the stone steps and foundation stones of their homes to the Yellow River. In this way, day and night, it was truly "a tall building rises from the ground, and brothers work together to turn soil into gold." The people mobilized their great potential strength. After a month, the originally empty Yellow River embankment was filled with mountain-like bricks and stones. The Yellow River project began. On the embankment, the joyful songs of the laborers sounded before dawn. People carrying and pushing soil were constantly flowing. Whether in the wind and rain or under the scorching sun, day after day, with the labor of the people, the Yellow River embankment became stronger. This was a vast project, with more than one million man-days of earthwork and 320,000 large vehicles transporting materials. From April to June, the Yellow River embankment, which had been destroyed by the enemy, became a solid defense barrier for the people. In this vast Yellow River project, Qian Zhengying had become—an organizer and leader. As she had already realized: "It's not just the brain and hands of an engineer, but the brains and hands of many masses" was proven once again. The Yellow River, which had been flowing freely for thousands of miles, finally entered the sea. Sure enough, when the autumn flood came, it surged like thousands of horses galloping. The huge disaster of Lijin Gaojia breach in the tenth year of the Republic of China had a flow rate of 8,000 cubic meters per second at that time, but this time it was more than 7,000 cubic meters per second. The Yellow River roared, the Yellow River surged. The most dangerous point of the Yellow River was in Mawan. The violence of nature came here terribly to tear everything apart. At that time, it was really extremely tense. The eyes of thousands of people were focused on the raging waves. Under the leadership of the Yellow River Management Headquarters, countless liberated and enlightened masses desperately rushed to repair the dangerous works as if they were saving their own lives. Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary faction, which was even more evil than the raging floods, sent planes to repeatedly strafe the Yellow River embankment. --Some people bled, but people still rushed to Mawan like tireless steel! Block it! A great battle between man and nature unfolded. This battle lasted for a long nine days and nights. The raging Yellow River did not defeat Mawan, but the dangerous works of Mawan defeated the Yellow River.

    Qian Zhengying, after experiencing countless struggles, finally became an engineer of the people. She is now the deputy director of the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau. When I visited her, she sincerely told me: "The truly great engineers are the people and the Chinese Communist Party." This sentence is very profound. She did not want to talk about her personal affairs. She referred to her comrades-in-arms in the struggle, including Zhou Baoju, an old engineer over 50 years old, female surveyors Xie Guohua and Feng Jiabi, and more importantly, the millions of laborers who went from the Huai River, the Grand Canal to the Yellow River. She attributed the achievements to their efforts. But I know that Qian Zhengying's dream has been realized in the new society. We are precisely the ones who want to turn dreams into reality. Therefore, her path is not only a victory for the liberation of Chinese women, but also a brilliant victory for the new China.

　　与洪水搏斗
  　记治河女工程师钱正英
    刘白羽
    钱正英，是第一个参予对淮河、运河、黄河狂暴洪水作战，而获得光辉成绩的女工程师。可是她告诉我：“作为一个女工程师，在旧社会里只是梦想。”
    她的父亲是从美国学水利工程回来的，他爱女儿，他把理想寄托给女儿，一九三六年夏天，他担任汉水堤防工程，他忽然把女儿召到自己身边。她永远记得——那是一个多么愁郁的夏天，因为父亲前任的工程主任，由于江洪决堤，就被国民党政府枪杀，拿一个工程师的血来掩盖国民党政府自身贪污腐化，荒废工程的罪恶。……难道这就是中国工程的出路吗！？
    后来，虽然她在上海继续学水利工程，虽然脑际里还常常浮现苏联女工程师们的幻影，但是黑暗重重加深了她的思索，她知道万恶的旧社会，是不容一个女人正当发展的。她沉重的想着：“如果说科学家是爬到树上采果子，但树下站的全是特权阶级人物，这又有什么意义呢！”从此她结束了她在旧社会的梦想，她坚强决定：“现在先让我来把旧社会破坏了吧！”钱正英于一九四一年成为中国共产党党员，那时她热烈献身于秘密工作，她等待着有这样一天，在暴动中，把自己的鲜血洒在土地上，让将来再在这块土地上矗立起巨大工程吧！
    一九四二年，由于她在上海已引起敌人的注意，奉党的命令，从上海撤退到淮北游击区。当时，在淮北党的领导面前，正发生了一个严重的治河问题，党发现了钱正英，把她调到修筑淮河大堤的岗位上来。钱正英作为一个工程师，不是袖手旁观，而是和大家一齐动手量土方，计算土方，来确定工资。从淮河工程中，钱正英理解到：“工程是与自然斗争，但工程本身是有阶级性的。”淮河工程是在共产党领导下，这就一切不同了，群众积极性发动了，无数面竞赛的红旗，整日夜飘在大堤上，这就是无穷无尽的力量，组织，帮助这力量就能战胜一切。淮河工程告竣后，党调钱正英去“整风”，学习了正确的思想方法，这决定以后，她在淮北一带深入群众，调查研究，完成了一个“宝应湖调查”的大工程。可是钱正英在实际工作中还是遇到了若干次失败，正是从失败中学习，累积经验，她继续献身于更巨大的人民工程事业。
    一九四六年，华中分局坚决修筑横贯解放区的二百余里的运河两岸大堤。当时处在苏北七战七捷之后，战事已发展到运河上来，——远近时常听到枪响，飞机天天在轰炸，而华中南线正在激战，……大堤决否？关系着华中全局的成败。这次，钱正英被任命为南段工程处副处长。秋汛终于来了，水陡涨，——高邮湖水位涨到了一丈七尺四寸（这是仅次于民国二十年巨灾的可怕现象）。九月十七日早晨，沿高邮湖一百里湖面上突然起了暴风，巨浪象山崩一样朝大堤猛扑了来，它要砸碎这条堤，向大海咆哮狂奔。这时沿河群众近一万人奔上大堤，他们拿麻袋装石头堵险打，桩，挂树，那里崩塌向那里抢修。钱正英和大家一齐，浑身浸在水里，整整斗争了两日夜，这一场大惊险才渐渐归于平静。十月初，华中部队在激战后向北方作战略转移，钱正英也就告别了运河，于一九四七年一月十三日跨过陇海路到了山东。
    钱正英又接受了战争火焰的锻炼，她在前线完成一段保证雨季汽车运输的工程。为了胜利，在二月春寒的清早，冒水里的冰凌，她和民工们跳进水里去搭桥，可是最后滂沱的大雨让她找不到一撮干土来铺路了，而前线情况十分紧急，路又变成泥塘，这怎么办呢？她就奋身跳到泥浆里，扬臂高呼，领导着大家用双手把一辆一辆卡车推向前方，推向前方，让我们部队好向敌人进击。她在这样艰难岗位上坚持了一年，直到陈粟大军出黄河以南支援刘邓大军挺进中原，她才留下在渤海区。
    钱正英在渤海区，遇到了中国历史上最难治理的黄河，黄河水灾的悲惨印象，多少年永留于北部中国劳动人民的脑子里。钱正英在这里开始了与黄河的搏斗。可是谁知几十年最严重的一次凌汛，就在四八年初爆发了——上游天暖冰溶，无数冰块冲激下来，可是下游天寒还未解冻，冰便在河身上淤积如巨山，堵塞水流，于是黄河可怕的狂暴起来，便横着泛滥了。那时沿河人民失望黄河，除夕夜里，黄河堤上一片敲锣报警的声音，老百姓把棉衣脱下来棉被抱出来抢塞大堤裂洞。最后，终于用巨量炸药从黄河淤冰上冲开一条路，降服了可怕的黄河凌汛。
    紧接着黄河春修，黄河旧日工程，经日本人摧毁，蒋介石破坏，已经圯废不堪了。这时，在渤海区党的领导下，组成治黄总指挥部，由王卓如、江衍坤、钱正英担任正副指挥，来兴筑这浩大的工程。可是一个绝顶难题是没有材料，黄河岸上一片荒沙，过去用石头是由济南运来，可是当时济南控制在敌人手里，不但不给石头，还开枪，袭击这岸的工程人员，没有材料，这黄河工程又怎样修呢？可是钱正英笑着告诉我：
    “只要和群众站在一起，就有了无穷的力量。”
    事实证明如此，解放区很多奇迹是这样出现的，新中国也是这样出现的。经过党的号召，渤海人民展开了热烈的献砖献石运动，他们说：“砸碑治河保家乡。”人们络绎不绝，奔向黄河，有从五百里外赶来的远征军，有无数妇女儿童把家里台阶石、墙基石都背往黄河，这样日夜不息，真正是“万丈高楼平地起，兄弟同心土变金”，人民发动了他们的伟大潜在的力量，经过一个月，原来空荡荡的黄河大堤上竖立起如山的砖石。黄河工程开始了，大堤上，黎明之前就响起劳动者愉快的歌声，抬土推土的人川流不息，无论在风雨里，在骄阳下，日复一日，随着人们的劳作，黄河堤身也就坚固起来了，这是一场浩大的工程，作土方就有一百多万人工，运材料就有三十二万辆大车，经过四月到六月，被敌人毁坏了的黄河大堤变成坚固的保卫人民的防垒了，在这浩大的黄河工程中，钱正英已成为——一个组织者，领导者了，正如她早已体会到的：“不只是工程师一个人的脑和手，而靠很多群众的脑和手”又一次得到了证明，黄河千里一泄，从此入海，果然秋汛一来就腾如万马奔腾，民国十年利津高家决口巨灾，当时流量每秒八千立方公尺，可是这一回为每秒七千余立方公尺，黄河咆哮了，黄河汹涌澎湃了。黄河险要的险要在麻湾，大自然暴力向这里可怕的扑来要撕毁一切，当时真是紧张万分，千万人的眼睛都注视着狂涛骇浪，在治黄总指挥部领导之下，被解放了的，有了觉悟的无数群众象抢救自己生命一样，拼命抢修险工。比狂暴洪水还要万恶的蒋介石反动派出动飞机在黄河堤上反复扫射。——有的人流血了，可是人们还是不停息的钢铁一样奔向麻湾，抢啊！堵啊！人与大自然展开伟大搏斗，这搏斗经历了漫长的九昼夜，狂暴的黄河没战胜麻湾，而是麻湾的险工战胜了黄河。
    钱正英经历无数斗争，终于成了一个人民的工程师了，她现在是山东省河务局副局长。当我访问她时，她诚恳的告诉我：“真正伟大的工程师是人民，是中国共产党。”这句话是十分深刻的，她不愿说她个人的事情，她推说她斗争中的战友，那里面有五十余岁老工程师周保菊，有女测量员谢国华，冯家璧，更多的是从淮河、运河到黄河的千百万劳动者，她推说他们的劳绩。但是我知道，钱正英的梦想在新社会里实现了，我们正是要把梦想变成现实的，因此她的道路，不仅仅是中国妇女解放的胜利，同时也就是新中国光辉灿烂的胜利。
