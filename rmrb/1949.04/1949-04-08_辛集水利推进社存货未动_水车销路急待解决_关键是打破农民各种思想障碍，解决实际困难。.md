　　Xinji Water Conservancy Promotion Cooperative's Stock Remains Unsold
  　Waterwheel Sales Urgently Need Resolution
    The Key is to Break Down Various Ideological Obstacles of the Peasants and Solve Practical Difficulties.
    [This Newspaper Reported] How to sell the prepared waterwheels to farmers is one of the urgent problems to be solved by the Jizhong Water Conservancy Promotion Cooperative. The Xinji branch of the Jizhong Water Conservancy Promotion Cooperative is responsible for promoting waterwheels and well-drilling equipment to eleven districts and nine counties and cities including Shulu. Preparations began last winter: ordering waterwheels from various factories and purchasing a large number of well-drilling equipment from distant places. There are currently 25 complete waterwheels in stock, as well as large cast iron and wrought iron waterwheel rims, enough to assemble 461 waterwheels; well-drilling equipment includes more than 4,300 catties of tree fiber, more than 4,100 catties of cement, more than 570 bamboo tubes and strips, more than 4,000 catties of various iron wires, and many other items such as iron cones, iron pipes, and cone handles. However, by the end of March this year, except for the sale of one set of well-drilling equipment, not a single waterwheel had been sold. The Shulu County Production Promotion Cooperative had prepared 60 waterwheels, but sold only 7; of 12 well cones, only one was sold; of 100 catties of tree fiber, only 30 catties were sold; and 280 catties of iron wire remained untouched. At the Xinji City Spring Festival Temple Fair, various agricultural tools were traded to varying degrees, but not a single waterwheel was sold. This is a noteworthy problem. Today, after the end of land reform, farmers are eager to develop water conservancy. According to Cui Yusan, director of the Shulu County Production Promotion Cooperative: this year, after promoting cotton planting, the county needs to add 200 new waterwheels, repair 1,000 old waterwheels, and dig 1,000 wells. Preliminary research shows that the reasons for the difficulty in selling waterwheels are: First, the harvest was not good last year, and the masses lack sufficient capital and necessary assistance. For example, three households including Zhang Huiyou in Yaotou Village, Shulu, wanted to buy a waterwheel last summer and had already discussed it together, but they didn't buy it because of the poor autumn harvest. Second, there are concerns about the burden of irrigated land: farmers who are allocated irrigated land generally have higher yields, but the burden per mu of irrigated and dry land differs by seven or eight *shi dou* , which has not yet changed, so they feel that growing irrigated land is not as good as growing dry land. Third, "disunity" has the greatest impact on production. In Liushuangying Village, Shulu, six households including Feng Gengzi pushed each other last year because some wells were broken, and no one came forward, leaving the jointly purchased waterwheel idle for a year. The education committee member in Yaotou Village wanted to sell some grain and buy a waterwheel, but the well did not belong to one family, and it was inconvenient to use, so he did not buy it. Fourth, some farmers still want to rely on loans. There are also individual small vendors who have just been allocated land, are not accustomed to using waterwheels, and think that "growing dry land is easier." But there are also cases like this: the cadres of Hezhuang Village, Shulu, are particularly responsible. From last winter to the present, they have repaired 31 waterwheels and bought 10 new ones.
    It is very clear that, apart from those who have genuine difficulties, the main problem is organization and propaganda. Director Cui of the Shulu County Promotion Cooperative said: "The main task of the promotion cooperatives in each district for the past two months has been to urge and clear up old loans, and recently the main focus has been on investigating the number of cotton plantings. The issue of waterwheels and wells has only been called for at production meetings, and no specific measures have been devised; and who to sell to has not been decided." According to Liu Jinpo of the branch office, this year rural cooperatives have not been universally organized, and farmers are relatively poor. In addition to the general office sending a team to Jin County to help organize, the main reliance is on the county production promotion cooperatives to promote sales. These methods are: (1) selling to county cooperatives at below market prices. (2) Entrusting county promotion cooperatives to sell on commission, with a certain remuneration. (3) Paying two-thirds of the price in cash, and the other one-third offset by goods, to be repaid after the autumn harvest. (4) Entrusting well-digging workers to sell equipment on commission. (5) Entrusting better village cooperatives to sell on commission. Of the above methods, Yuanwuqiang County originally planned to buy six or seven waterwheels, but later stopped for fear of not being able to sell them. Several workers have already sold on commission, but the others have not been implemented. All of these methods can be adopted. After having a plan, the main reliance is on the county and district leaders to do meticulous organizational work. It is necessary to find ways from many aspects to deliver the waterwheels to the hands of the farmers in order to achieve the goal of increasing agricultural production.

　　辛集水利推进社存货未动
  　水车销路急待解决
    关键是打破农民各种思想障碍，解决实际困难。
    【本报讯】如何把已准备好的水车出售给农民，是目前冀中水利推进社急待解决的问题之一。冀中水利推进社辛集分销处负责向十一分区束鹿等九县市推销水车及打井器材。自去冬便开始了准备工作：从各工厂订购水车，从远地采买了大批打井器材。现存有全套水车二十五辆，生熟铁水车大轮，可配四百六十一辆；打井器材有树棕四千三百余斤，洋灰四千一百余斤，竹筒竹片五百七十余根，各种铁丝四千余斤，其他如铁椎、铁管、椎把等甚多。但至今年三月底为止，除卖出一部打井器材外，水车还未推销一辆。束鹿县生产推进社，已准备好六十辆水车，卖出不过七辆，十二根井椎卖出一根，一百斤树棕卖出三十斤，二百八十斤铁丝原封未动。辛集市春节庙会上，各种农具多少都有交易，惟水车没有卖出一辆。这是值得注意的问题。在结束土改后的今天，农民是迫切要求发展水利的。据束鹿县生产推进社主任崔余三谈：今年提倡植棉后，全县须添新水车二百辆，修理旧水车一千辆，打井一千眼。经初步研究，水车销售困难的原因是：一、去年收成不好，群众资本不足，缺乏必要帮助。如束鹿摇头村张惠有等三户，去夏便想买水车，已商量到一起，因秋收不好，便没买成。二、对水地负担有顾虑：农民分到水地，大部产量较高，水旱地负担每亩相差七、八市斗，至今尚未改变，觉得种水地并不如种旱地。三、因“人心不齐”，影响生产的最多。束鹿刘双营村冯更子等六户，去年因井坏了一些，互相推脱，无人出头，把合买的水车闲了一年。摇头村教育委员，想卖点粮食，买一辆水车，但水井不属一家，使用不方便，结果没买。四、有些农民还想依赖贷款。还有个别小商贩，刚分到地，没有使用水车习惯，以为“种旱地省事”。但也有这种情况：束鹿河庄村干部特别负责，去冬至今，已修理水车三十一辆，买新的十辆。
    很清楚的可以看出除了确有困难者外，主要是组织宣传问题。束鹿县推进社崔主任说：“各区推进社，两个月来主要作的是催收清理旧贷工作，最近主要是调查种棉数目字。水车水井问题，只在生产大会上号召了一下，究竟如何作，还没有想出具体办法；究竟卖给谁，还没有想出“目标”呢。据分销处柳金坡谈：今年农村还没有普遍组织起合作社，农民又比较困难，除总社已派一组到晋县帮助组织外，主要依靠各县生产推进社推销：这些办法是：（一）低于市价出卖给县社。（二）委托县推进社代销，给一定报酬。（三）交现款三分之二，其他三分之一折成实物，秋后偿还。（四）委托打井工人代销器材。（五）委托较好村社代销。以上办法，原武强县打算买六、七辆，后又怕卖不出去而中止。已有几个工人代销，其他均未实现。这些办法都可采用。有了办法后，主要依靠县区领导上作细密的组织工作。要从多方面想办法，把水车交给农民手中，才能达到农业增产目的。
