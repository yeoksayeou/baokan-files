　　Peiping Municipal Middle and Primary School Teachers' Union Protests Unreasonable Measures by the French Government

[Reported by this newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the Peiping Municipal Middle and Primary School Teachers' Union issued a letter of protest against the French reactionary government's restrictions on the entry of representatives to the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. It first rebuked the French reactionary government's unreasonable and despicable behavior as "once again revealing to the world who are the true destroyers of peace and who are preparing for a new war of aggression." It then confidently stated: "The Chinese people and the people of the world, united, will surely achieve victory in the struggle to defend world peace and oppose all the malicious conspiracies of war instigators and peace destroyers!"
