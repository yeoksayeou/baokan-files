    Democratic Personage Liu Yazi
    Cables Congratulations on the Liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan
    [From Our Newspaper] Democratic personage Liu Yazi sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, congratulating them on the liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan. The telegram reads: "To Chairman Mao, Commander-in-chief Zhu, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: Victory reports are flying in, and the military might is unstoppable. The desolate former capital of Jianye saw no die-hard enemies, and the isolated Bingzhou was swept clean of the remaining bandits. One hundred years of sacrifice and bloodshed have finally blossomed, and three thousand years of suffering people have stood up to build the nation. May the great spirit of the Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, bear witness to this. I dare to express my loyalty and humbly request your attention. Liu Yazi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, kowtows."

    电贺南京太原解放
    【本报讯】民主人士柳亚子氏电毛主席、朱总司令贺南京太原解放。电称：毛主席、朱总司令即中共中央及中国人民解放军全体指战员同鉴：捷报星传，军威竹破。栖皇建业，竟无断脰之顽凶，寥落并门，更扫负＠之残寇。一百年牺牲血泊，结果开花，三千载苦难人民，翻身建国。庶几国父孙先生大天之灵，实昭鉴之，敢效葵悃，伏希电察。中国国民党革命委员会中央监察委员会常务委员会主席柳亚子叩。
