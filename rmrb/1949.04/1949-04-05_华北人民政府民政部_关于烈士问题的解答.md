Civil Affairs Department of the North China People's Government
Answers Regarding the Issue of Martyrs

I. Who Can Obtain the Title of Martyr?

　　Question: (1) If a local cadre carries a gun to the countryside for work and accidentally shoots himself, resulting in death, does this count as a martyr? (Asked by Wang Shou Xian of the Pingyou County Propaganda Department)

　　(2) During the support for the Taiyuan Campaign last year, Ding Shun, a stretcher-bearer from Beiying Village, Lingshou County, Chahar Province, died of illness on the way. Also, can the district cadre Liu Guoxiang be considered a martyr if he dies of illness while working? (Asked by Si Hongzhi of the Lingshou Second District Office)

　　(3) If a soldier goes home on leave and is unexpectedly surrounded and shot by the enemy, should he be called a martyr? (Asked by Wang Shou Xian)

　　Answer: Dying from an accidental gunshot wound or dying of illness on the way to support the front cannot be considered acts meriting the title of martyr, and their family members cannot be considered dependents of a martyr. Even general sacrifices in the line of duty or death from overwork and illness only entitle them to certain compensations and preferential treatment (see the North China Region's Regulations on Commendation and Compensation for Casualties of Revolutionary Workers). Unless there are special merits during one's lifetime and approved by the North China People's Government, one cannot be called a martyr.

　　Generally speaking, if a front-line soldier goes home on leave and is surrounded and shot by the enemy, it is neither considered participation in combat nor an act in the line of duty, so he cannot be called a martyr. If he has not left the military, he can be compensated as a soldier who died of illness. If he demonstrates special heroic behavior or is captured and remains unyielding, dying a heroic death, he must be approved by a government above the county level to be called a martyr. The handling of the matter must be notified to the original unit for future reference.

　　Martyr is a glorious title. Not only are their deeds in life worthy of learning by future generations, but also their death is heroic and can serve as a model for future generations. Therefore, only those who sacrifice themselves on the battlefield, in court, in prison, or in mass movements, fighting bravely and unyieldingly for the revolutionary cause, can be considered martyrs (however, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who sacrifice themselves in the line of duty can also be called martyrs).

II. What Kind of Proof is Required for a Martyr's Sacrifice?

　　Question: Soldiers at the front keep casually writing letters to military family members reporting that so-and-so has sacrificed, causing ideological anxiety among military family members, who constantly go to the government to demand the transportation of the martyr's body. How should this problem be solved? (Civil Affairs Section of the Xiyang County Government)

　　Answer: A soldier's sacrifice must be confirmed by a "Certificate of Sacrifice of Revolutionary Soldiers" filled out by the political organ of the regiment or higher level of the unit. Otherwise, it is easy to report errors due to discrepancies in what individual personnel of the unit see and hear. There have been many examples of this in the past, such as seeing someone fall on the battlefield, but it does not mean they sacrificed. Therefore, one should explain this carefully to the family members of the military personnel. If their children have indeed sacrificed for the revolution, the certificate will be issued sooner or later (this certificate will indicate the cause, time, location, and burial site of the sacrifice). Do not believe the letters from individual personnel. Comrades working in the unit who know that someone has sacrificed should report it to the political department above the regiment level as soon as possible and ask them to investigate and promptly send a letter to the county government to inform the family members.

III. What is the Scope of Martyr's Family Members? What Treatment Should They Receive?

　　Question: (1) What is a martyr's family member? How should they be treated?

　　(2) In Dacenggou Village, Jianping Fourth District, there is a martyr's family member named Liu Yintao. His mother remarried to the Li family in this village after the Anti-Japanese War, and Yintao joined the army before the land reform and later sacrificed himself. His mother established a separate household for the land and property he left behind. In the past, when the mother and son were together, a portion of land was cultivated on behalf of his mother. Does his mother still deserve this arrangement this year? (Asked by Wang Huaying of Jianping Fourth District)

　　Answer: Martyr's family members are the parents (some parents who have separated can also be considered martyr's family members), wife (or husband), children, and siblings under the age of sixteen who live in the same household as the martyr, and other relatives who raised the martyr and now depend on the martyr for livelihood. In addition to issuing various "Certificates of Honor," the following compensations are given to these family members:

　　(1) Revolutionary soldiers who sacrifice in combat, sacrifice in the line of duty, or are killed by the enemy: A. Squad leader and soldier level: 600 jin of millet. B. Company, platoon, and company-level: 800 jin of millet. C. Regiment-level and above: 1,000 jin of millet.

　　(2) Revolutionary soldiers who die from overwork and illness: A. Squad leader and soldier level: 450 jin of millet. B. Company, platoon, and company-level: 600 jin of millet. C. Regiment-level and above: 750 jin of millet.

　　(3) Revolutionary workers who sacrifice in combat, fight against the enemy, or are killed by the enemy: A. Guards, public security personnel, and miscellaneous personnel: 600 jin of millet. B. County section chiefs, district chiefs, and cadres below the district chief level: 800 jin of millet. C. County chief level and cadres above the county chief level: 1,000 jin of millet.

　　(4) Revolutionary workers who die of illness from overwork: A. Guards, public security personnel, miscellaneous personnel: 450 jin of millet. B. County section chiefs, district chiefs, and cadres below the district chief level: 600 jin of millet. C. County chief level and cadres above the county chief level: 750 jin of millet.

　　(5) Civilian laborers who sacrifice in combat: 400 jin of millet.

　　This compensation is issued by the original county government and received by the direct relatives. However, there should be an order of priority as to who can enjoy it first. First, only the wife (or husband) living at home receives it, then the children living at home, then the parents, then the siblings under the age of sixteen, then the other relatives who raised the martyr and now need to rely on the martyr for livelihood, and finally the direct relatives who are working. If there are none of the above relatives, it will not be issued.

　　Whatever preferential treatment the martyr enjoyed before his sacrifice should continue to be enjoyed after his sacrifice. As for the issue of cultivating on behalf of the mother of Liu Yintao in the second question above, even though they are now two separate households, his mother is still a martyr's family member and should still be given the arrangement of cultivated on her behalf. Moreover, martyr's family members should be given priority care, that is, military martyrs should have priority over military families, worker martyrs should have priority over worker families, and militia and civilian labor martyrs should have priority over militia and civilian labor families.

IV. What Should be Done if Martyr's Family Members Have Difficulty Relocating the Remains?

　　Question: (1) Some martyr's family members are not in financial difficulty and can solve the travel expenses for relocating the remains themselves. But some martyr's family members are living in poverty and lack travel expenses. How should this be solved?

　　(2) The martyr's coffin has rotted, or he was buried without a coffin. How should the request to replace the coffin when relocating the remains be resolved?

　　Answer: (1) Relocation of remains should be suspended in war zones and during busy farming seasons. It is now the spring plowing season, and martyr's family members should be persuaded to postpone relocation. The graves of martyrs buried temporarily in various places should also be properly protected.

　　Martyr's family members who relocate remains should have a certificate from the political department of the military above the regiment level and the government above the county level, stating where the body is located, before they can request the allocation of personnel for relocation during the slack farming season. The travel expenses of those who relocate the remains should be borne by themselves in principle. If the family situation is indeed difficult, with proof from the district and village, the county government of origin should provide a discretionary subsidy for travel expenses, not exceeding one month round trip at most, with a daily subsidy of one jin of millet. If the journey is indeed long, relocation should be postponed until the railway is restored. All railways that are open to traffic should be free of charge in principle, but if there are special difficulties, a notice should be given to suspend transportation in advance.

　　(2) A coffin burial fee is given to all martyrs who sacrifice to ensure proper burial. The regulations for coffin burial fees are as follows: Revolutionary soldiers or revolutionary workers who sacrifice receive 500 to 600 jin of millet in the plains area and 400 to 500 jin of millet in the mountainous area, reimbursed according to actual expenses. Civilian militia and laborers who sacrifice receive 400 jin of millet. However, if the martyr's coffin has rotted over the years, or if a coffin was not used, and the martyr's family member has difficulty replacing the coffin, they can report to the county government of the burial site for approval, and a subsidy can be given again within the scope of 300 jin of millet.

V. What Attitude Should County and District Cadres Adopt Towards Martyr's Family Members?

　　Question: A martyr's family member from Xiliangzhuang, Gaoyi County, has a notification from the political department of the division and went to the county government to request the relocation of the remains. But the person in charge of the county government said: "This letter is for you, it doesn't tell us, go by yourself!" He then went to look for the troops between Beiping and Zhangjiakou (how could he find them), and had no choice but to go to Qian'an. Fortunately, he found the burial site and requested the county government to mobilize people to relocate the remains (the martyr sacrificed in the Yejishe battle during the liberation). The person in charge of the county said: "This letter (referring to the proof letter from the troops) tells you that he sacrificed, but it doesn't tell you to relocate the remains, and your county doesn't have a letter either, you should still get a letter of introduction!" The martyr's family member had no choice but to return. Not reconciled, he went to look for the troops again, found us near ××, and then opened a letter of introduction. The martyr's family member set off on the sixth day of the first lunar month and has spent more than three million yuan (border currency) in half a month. The old man almost fell ill outside. He was very frustrated, but not discouraged, and did not complain. He just said: "I'll save some food and go again after the autumn harvest!" We suggest that the government should be actively, proactively, and flexibly solve this problem. This is a matter of mass customs. We should actively help. (Organization Department of the ×× Corps Political Department)

　　Answer: This issue deserves serious attention from the staff of various counties and districts. The handling of the matter by the two county governments is incorrect. Gaoyi County, in particular, should bear greater responsibility. Although the martyr's notification from the political department of the division is for the family members, it is also a certificate. The county government should take the initiative to exchange it for a Certificate of Honor and should not say: "This letter is for you, it doesn't tell us." All county governments have already received the notification that the relocation of remains in the Tianjin area has been temporarily suspended. Instead of using this reason to persuade the martyr's family members, they just said: "Go by yourself!" This is even more wrong. If the comrades of the county government agree to the martyr's family members going to relocate the remains, they should actively help. If they do not agree, they should try to dissuade them and not let them fend for themselves. However, if an individual martyr's family member goes to the county government of the burial site without being introduced by the county of origin, although this is not in accordance with the procedures, they should be criticized. But since he has the martyr's notification, he should still be given help and should not say: "You should still get a letter of introduction!" In short, we should be very enthusiastic towards martyr's family members, seriously consider their difficulties, and help as much as possible. At the same time, we also hope that martyr's family members will listen to the well-intentioned advice of county and district cadres. It is okay to want to return the remains, but it is not good to completely disregard production, the difficulty of transportation, and run around on your own without going through certain procedures, without getting results.

　　华北人民政府民政部
  　关于烈士问题的解答
  　一、谁可取得烈士称号？
    问：（一）地方干部，因工作带枪下乡，不慎走火致命，算不算烈士？（平由县委宣传部王守先问）
    （二）察哈尔省灵寿县北营村担架队员丁顺，于去年支援太原战役时，途中病故；又区干部刘国祥在工作中病死，算不算烈士？（灵寿二区公所司鸿志问）
    （三）战士请假回家，不意被敌包围枪杀，是否称为烈士？（王守先问）
    答：带枪走火打死与支前时途中病故不得称为烈士，其家属亦不得称为烈属。即使是一般因公牺牲或积劳病故，也只能取得一定的抚恤与优待（见华北区革命工作人员伤亡褒恤条例）。除生前有特殊功绩，经华北人民政府批准者外，不得称为烈士。
    前方战士请假回家被敌包围枪杀，一般说，因既非参战，又非因公，不能称为烈士，如本人未脱离军籍，可依病故军人抚恤。如其有特殊英勇表现或被俘不屈慷慨就义，需经县以上政府批准，始可称为烈士。并须将处理情形通知原部队备查。
    烈士是一光荣称号，不但其生前事迹足资后人学习，而且他的死，是英烈的，足为后人楷模，故凡在战场上、法庭上、监狱中、或群众运动中，忠心为革命事业英勇斗争威武不屈而牺牲者，方为烈士（但人民解放军指战员因公牺牲者亦可称为烈士）。
    二、烈士牺牲须有何种证明？
    问：我县不断有前方战士随便与军属写信，报告某某牺牲，造成军属思想不安，每日不断到政府要求搬运烈士尸体，对此问题应如何解决？（昔阳县政府民政科）
    答：军人牺牲必须有部队团以上政治机关填具之“革命军人牺牲证明书”方可证实，不然很易因部队个别人员所见所闻的差错而报告错误。这在过去有很多的例子，如在战场上明眼看到某人倒下，但并非牺牲。因此应向军属好好解释，其子弟如实系为革命牺牲，迟早定会有证明书（此种证明书上注有牺牲原因、时间、地点及埋葬地点），不要相信个别人员的信函。而在部队工作的同志，如知某人牺牲，应速向团以上政治部报告，请其经过调查，迅函县府转告其家属。
    三、烈士家属范围如何？对烈属如何待遇？
    问：（一）何谓烈属？对其如何待遇？
    （二）建屏四区大岑沟村有一烈属刘银桃，其母亲在抗战后带他改嫁本村李家，土改前银桃参军，以后牺牲，其母将其遗留房地财产另立一户。过去母子在一起时，给其母代耕土地一部。今年其母仍要求代耕，是否应享受？（建屏四区王华英问）
    答：烈属是与烈士本人同居一家过活的父母（有的父母虽已分居亦得以烈属论）、妻（或夫）、子女、及十六岁以下的弟妹，和抚养烈士长大而今又必须依靠烈士生活的其他亲属。对以上家属的待遇，除发给各种“光荣纪念证”外，并给以如下抚恤：
    （一）革命军人因作战牺牲，或因公牺牲，或被敌杀害者：Ａ班长战士级：小米六百市斤。Ｂ营连排级：小米八百市斤。Ｃ团级以上：小米一千市斤。
    （二）革命军人在工作中积劳成疾而致死亡者：Ａ班长战士级：小米四百五十市斤。Ｂ营连排级：小米六百市斤。Ｃ团级以上：小米七百五十市斤。
    （三）革命工作人员因参战或对敌斗争或被敌杀害者：Ａ警卫队员、公安队员及勤杂人员，小米六百市斤。Ｂ县科长、区长级，及区长级以下之干部：小米八百市斤。Ｃ县长级及县长级以上之干部小米一千市斤。
    （四）革命工作人员因公积劳病故者：Ａ警卫人员、公安队员、勤杂人员：小米四百五十市斤。Ｂ县科长、区长级以下之干部：小米六百市斤。Ｃ县长级以上之干部：小米七百五十市斤。
    （五）民工因参战牺牲者：小米四百市斤。
    此项抚恤费，由原级县政府发给，由其直系亲属承领。但直系亲属中谁可优先享受，应有顺序。首先仅在家居住之妻（或夫）承领，其次才是在家居住之子女，其次才是父母，其次才是十六岁以下的弟妹，其次才是抚养烈士长大而现在又需依靠烈士生活的其他亲属，最后才是参加工作的直系亲属。如无任何上述亲属，即不予发给。
    烈士本人在未牺牲前享受何种优待，牺牲后仍得继续享受。如上述第二问刘银桃母亲享受代耕问题，现虽分立两户，但其母仍为烈属，仍应给予代耕。而且，对烈属应该优先照顾，即军烈应优先于军属，工烈应优先于工属，民兵民工烈属应优先于民兵民工家属。
    四、烈属起棂有困难怎么办？
    问：（一）有些烈属家境尚不困难，起棂路费不自己解决。但有些烈属生活困苦，缺乏路费，应如何解决？
    （二）烈士棺木已经腐烂，或未经棺木埋葬，起棂时要求更换棺木如何解决？
    答：（一）在战争地区及农忙时期，应停止运棂。现在正值春耕，应劝阻烈属起运。各地有寄埋之烈士坟墓，亦应妥为保护。
    烈属运棂，应有军队团以上之政治部门及县以上政府之证明文件，说明其尸体确在何处者，始可于农闲时请求拨差搬运。其起运人之路费，以自筹为原则。家庭情况确实困难者，经区村证明，由原籍县府酌情补助路费，最高往返不超过一月，每日补助小米一斤。其有路程确远者，应俟铁路恢复后，再行起运。各通车铁路原则上应予免费，但有特殊困难时，应先行通知停运。
    （二）烈士牺牲时皆给以棺葬费，妥为安葬。棺葬费规定计：革命军人或革命工作人员牺牲者，在平原地区小米五百市斤至六百市斤，山地四百市斤至五百市斤。在此数内实报实销。民兵民工牺牲者小米四百市斤。但烈士棺木年久腐烂，或未用棺木者，烈属重置棺木又很困难，可报请安葬地之县政府批准，在三百市斤小米范围内重行补助。
    五、县区干部对烈属应采什么态度？
    问：今有高邑县西良庄一烈属，持有师政治部的通知书，到县政府要求搬棂。但县政府负责人说：“这信是给你们，没有告我们，你自己去吧！”他随后赴北平、张家口之间去找部队（他那能找到），只好到迁安，还不错，找到了埋头，请求县政府给动员人搬棂（烈士于解放野鸡蛇战斗中牺牲）。县负责人说：“这个信（指部队的证明信）是告诉你牺牲了，并未让你搬棂，同时你们县也没有信，你还是拿一介绍信来吧！”烈属无奈，只得回来，不甘心又去找部队，至××附近找到了我们，才开了一介绍信，烈属自阴历正月初六动身，至今已个半月了，共花费三百余万元（边币），老先生几乎病倒在外，他很恼丧，但不灰心，不埋怨。他只说：“秋后打点粮食再去吧！”我们意见应建议政府，请他们应积极、主动、灵活解决这个问题。这是一群众风俗问题。我们应该积极帮助。（××兵团政治部组织部）
    答：这个问题值得各县区工作人员严重注意，该两县政府的处理是不对的。特别高邑县要负更大的责任，师政治部的烈士通知书，虽是给家属的，但也就是证明书，县政府应该主动为之换光荣纪念证，不应该说：“这信是给你们的，没有告我们。”各县府都早得到通知，平津地区暂停运棂，不用这个道理去劝说烈属，只说：“你自己去吧！”更是不对的。县政府的同志，如果同意烈属去运，就要积极帮助，如不同意，就要多方劝阻，不要任其自流。但如有个别烈属未经其原籍县介绍，就去找了埋葬地的县政府，这虽于手续不合，应予批评。但他既有烈士通知书，仍应给以帮助，不可说：“你还是拿一介绍信来吧！”总之，我们对于烈属，应该十分热情，认真考虑他的因难。尽可能的帮助，同时也希望烈属，听从县区干部的善意劝告，想要运回棂柩是可以的，但完全不照顾生产，不照顾交通运输的困难，不经一定手继自己来往跑一阵，得不到结果，也是不好的。
