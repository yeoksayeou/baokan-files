　　The Pingjin Railway Bureau
    Convened a Symposium of Employee Representatives
  　Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Comrade Li Lisan Attended and Spoke
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to widely solicit opinions from employees, inspect work since liberation, and study production, welfare and other issues, the Pingjin Railway Bureau and the Preparatory Committee of the Railway Trade Union jointly held a symposium of railway employee representatives from the Pingjin area at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (the 20th) in the auditorium of the former Pinghan Railway Bureau. A total of 130 employee representatives from various factories and stations in Beijing Railway Bureau and Qianmen, Xizhimen, Changxindian, Fengtai, Tianjin, Nankou, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, Guye, Tanggu, Qinhuangdao, Pingdiquan and other places attended. When the worker representatives heard that Commander-in-Chief Zhu would personally attend the meeting to provide guidance, the audience burst into enthusiastic applause. After Director Guo Hongtao explained the significance of the meeting, Comrade Li Lisan spoke. He first explained that the current railway bureau is fundamentally different from the railway bureau of the past. The Pingjin Railway has a history of 58 years, but it has never held a meeting like today's. Afterwards, Comrade Lisan hoped that the workers would jointly manage and supervise the people's railway cause with the position of masters. At this time, Commander-in-Chief Zhu arrived at the venue, and all the representatives immediately stood up and applauded and cheered: "Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" "Wish Commander-in-Chief Zhu good health!" The applause lasted for a long time. After Comrade Li Lisan finished his speech, Commander-in-Chief Zhu began to speak amid thunderous applause, explaining in detail the current victorious situation in military, political, and economic aspects and the tasks of railway employees. After listening to the report, the representatives were extremely excited and discussed one after another: "This is really being the master!" "Commander-in-Chief Zhu cares about us workers so much, we should tell him about the production situation after liberation, and also tell him that we must work even better in the future."
    The conference will continue today, and representatives from various regions will continue to put forward opinions and conduct discussions. (Attached picture)
