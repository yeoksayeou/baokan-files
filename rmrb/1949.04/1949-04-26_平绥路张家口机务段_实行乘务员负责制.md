　　Ping-Sui Railway Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot
  　Implements Crew Responsibility System
    [Chahar News] The Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot on the Ping-Sui Railway has begun implementing the crew responsibility system. After the Pingjin Railway Bureau decided to implement the crew responsibility system on March 15th, the depot's employees began preparations. After several mobilization briefings, the workers realized that changing from a rotating shift system to a crew responsibility system was an important measure by the Communist Party and the People's Government to trust and rely on workers to build railway transportation. This enhanced the workers' sense of ownership. In the crew responsibility system, the original plan was for the crew to be responsible for minor repairs and boiler cleaning, but currently the drivers and stokers have not yet learned the above tasks. Therefore, three "package instructors" are assigned to guide the use, inspection, and repair of the locomotives in shifts. At the same time, the locomotive inspection and repair departments are also divided into two groups to help the drivers and stokers learn inspection and repair within three months. Once they are familiar with it, all locomotives, except those requiring factory repairs, will be the full responsibility of the crew. Now, nine people per locomotive have formed a group, with one driver as the group leader to lead the work of the entire group. The depot began testing with seven locomotives running passenger trains on the 6th of this month, with very good results. Since the 15th, all twenty-three locomotives have been officially implemented. During the trial period, each locomotive under the crew responsibility system was polished brightly. In the past, when a locomotive returned to the depot, the crew would go home, and no one would take care of the locomotive. Now, when a locomotive returns, even the other two shifts that are not on duty rush over, and all nine people are busy wiping the locomotive, cleaning the boiler... Old driver Li Qingshun, who hadn't wiped a locomotive in twenty years, is now covered in oil stains like a young lad. (He Jianping)

　　平绥路张家口机务段
  　实行乘务员负责制
    【察哈尔讯】平绥铁路张家口机务段，开始实行乘务负责制。平津路局于三月十五日决定实行乘务负责制后，该段职工即开始酝酿准备。经过几次动员说明，工友们认识了改轮乘制为乘务负责制是共产党、人民政府相信并依靠工人建设铁路交通的重要措施，因而提高了工人主人翁的自觉。在乘务负责中，原规定机车的小修与洗炉等工作亦由乘务员负责，但目前司机、司炉尚未学会以上工作，仍设三个“包指导”分班指导机车使用、检查和修理。同时机车检查、修理等部门也分为两组，分别帮助司机、司炉在三个月内学会检查及修理，俟其熟悉后除入厂修理之机车外，即可全由乘务员负责。现每台机车的九人已组成一个小组，各组设司机长一人，领导全组工作。该段已于本月六日起由跑票车的七台机车先期试验，结果很好，自十五日起二十三台机车已全部正式实行。在试验期中，每台实行了乘务负责制的机车都擦得油亮，过去机车一回车房，乘务员就回家，机车无人管，现在机车一回来，连未值乘的另外两班也赶来，九个人个个忙着擦车、清炉……。二十年来不擦车的老司机李庆顺，也和年青小伙子一样满手油污地擦起来。    （何建平）
