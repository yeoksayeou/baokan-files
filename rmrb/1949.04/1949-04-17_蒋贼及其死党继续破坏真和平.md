Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, April 14th: Public enemy number one, Chiang Kai-shek, and his cronies continue to carry out various conspiracies to sabotage true peace. In the past two weeks, Chen Cheng, Zhu Shaoliang, Song Ziwen, Zheng Yanfen (Secretary-General of the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters), Wang Shijie, Lei Zhen, Zhang Qun, Fang Zhi and others have successively gone to Xikou to ask for instructions from Chiang Kai-shek. After Song Ziwen sought instructions from Chiang Kai-shek and returned to Hong Kong, he went to Taiwan on the 9th of this month to confer with Chen Cheng and others. The American news agency, Associated Press, revealed that Song Ziwen's trip to Taiwan was to discuss with Chen Cheng "the status of Nationalist China in Taiwan" before undertaking some ambiguous mission for the Kuomintang government to Europe, and is drafting a plan to raise funds for Chen Cheng to resist the People's Liberation Army. Zheng Yanfen returned to Guangzhou on the 3rd of this month from Xikou. Zheng claimed that he went to Xikou to ask Chiang for instructions on matters related to the convening of the Kuomintang "Fifth Plenary Session." On the 6th, die-hard leaders such as Chen Lifu, Pan Gongzhan, Gu Zhenggang, and Zhang Daofan flew from Taiwan and Shanghai to Guangzhou. On the 7th, the Kuomintang Central News Agency issued a message from Guangzhou saying: "Distinguished guests are gathering here, suggesting that there will be major developments in the political situation." A certain Kuomintang Central Committee member even clamored that the Kuomintang "will reconsider the issue of peace and war." Tao Xisheng even made a statement on the 11th, dreaming of using the so-called early outbreak of the Third World War to save his life, saying: "If the CCP forces the government to surrender or crosses the river militarily, then China's national survival, the people's free way of life, and the security of the Far East will all be threatened and destroyed, and the Third World War will inevitably arrive earlier." All of these indicate Chiang Kai-shek and his cronies' conspiracy to make a comeback.

　　蒋贼及其死党继续破坏真和平
    【新华社北平十四日电】第一号人民公敌蒋介石及其死党继续进行各种破坏真和平的阴谋活动，在最近两周中先后到溪口向蒋贼请示的有陈诚、朱绍良、宋子文、郑彦＠（国民党中央党部秘书长）、王世杰、雷震、张群、方治等人，宋子文请示过蒋贼回到香港后，又于本月九日到台湾与陈诚等人会商。美国通讯社美联社透露宋子文到台是为了在衔国民党政府某种暧昧的使命赴欧洲之前与陈诚商讨“国民党中国在台湾的地位问题”，并正拟订一项为陈诚筹集经费抵抗人民解放军的计划，郑彦＠是本月三日由溪口回到广州的，郑声称他到溪口是向蒋请示国民党“五中全会召开有关事宜”。六日，陈立夫、潘公展、谷正纲，张道藩等死硬派首领即自台湾和上海飞往广州。七日，国民党中央社即从广州发出消息说：“此间冠盖云集，暗示政局将有重大发展。”某国民党中委并扬言国民党“将重新考虑和战问题”。陶希望更于十一日发表谈话，梦想以所谓提早发生的第三次世界大战来救命，说：“如果中共迫政府投降或以军事渡江，则中国之国家生存，人民之自由生活方式及远东之安全皆受其威胁及破坏，第三次世界大战必将提早到来。”所有这些都表明蒋介石及其死党准备卷土重来的阴谋。
