Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 10th - Tokyo Dispatch: Representatives from over fifty important Japanese labor unions held a meeting on the morning of the 7th, deciding to launch a "Down with the Yoshida Cabinet" movement by holding extensive mass rallies and demonstrations in various cities and villages across Japan this May Day.

	Meanwhile, the Japan Federation of Industrial Labor Unions sent a telegram on the 6th to the Soviet and American governments, the Far Eastern Commission, the Allied Council for Japan, and World Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Saillant, requesting that measures be taken to allow representatives of Japanese trade unions to attend the All-Soviet Trade Union Congress to be held in Moscow on April 19th, as MacArthur Headquarters has consistently ignored their application.

	Furthermore, fifteen representatives of Japanese democratic groups invited to attend the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Paris have also not yet received a response of permission from MacArthur Headquarters. These groups have decided to hold a similar congress in Tokyo on the same day as the Paris Peace Congress (April 20th).

　　“打倒吉田内阁！”
  　日工人将在“五一”示威
    【新华社北平十日电】东京消息：日本五十余重要工会的代表于七日晨举行会议，决定于今年五一节在日本各城市与乡村举行广泛的群众大会与示威游行，展开“打倒吉田内阁”的运动。
    同时，日本产业劳动组合联合会于六日致电苏、美政府及远东委员会、盟国对日管制委员会及世界工联主席赛扬，要求采取措施，使麦克阿瑟总部允许日本职工会代表出席四月十九日在莫斯科举行的全苏职工大会，因为麦氏总部对他们的申请，一直置之不理。
    又，应邀出席巴黎世界拥护和平大会的日本民主团体代表十五人，迄今亦未得到麦克阿瑟总部的许可答复。这些团体已决定在巴黎和平大会举行大会的同一日（四月二十日），在东京举行同样的大会。
