Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 19th: In order to welcome the first "May Day" Labor Day after liberation, workers in state-owned enterprises in Beiping have launched a production competition movement. The three major state-owned coal mines in the Beiping suburbs of Mentougou, Chengzi, and Xishan completed their plan of mining 94,000 tons of coal in January-March. In April they launched a major production competition to welcome "May Day." Since the launch of the competition in Mentougou Coal Mine, output has greatly increased. In early April, the number of underground coal miners in the mine decreased by 1,391 compared with before liberation, but the output increased by 783 tons compared with before liberation. The average efficiency of coal miners was 1.16 tons, breaking the mine's 30-year coal mining record. Xishan Coal Mine plans to produce 10,000 tons of coal in April, and all mine workers are currently working hard in production. The workers of Chengzi Coal Mine decided to strive for more output under the condition of saving materials. The production competition movement of the Beiping Branch of Jibei Electric Power Company to repair the lines outside the city, which started on April 1, had completed two-thirds by the 18th. All repair work will be completed before the 24th. The workers are in high spirits during the repair, leaving early and returning late every day, and reducing rest time at noon, so that they can work an average of more than two hours a day. The "May Day" 100-car dispatch movement initiated by the workers of the Beiping Tram Company Repair Factory has been completed ahead of schedule. The number of trams running on each line has now increased to 80. There are still 25 good cars in the factory, which can be dispatched at any time. Among them, there are four new-style trams, which have been newly painted and named "Beiping Liberation," "Production," "Labor," and "People," respectively, and are scheduled to be dispatched on "May Day." In the process of rushing to repair the vehicles, the workers of each shift automatically processed and helped each other, so no shift exceeded the planned target. The workers of the steam turbine department of the maintenance section of the Shijingshan Power Plant also warmly responded to the call to use production competition to welcome "May Day" and automatically worked overtime when repairing the No. 3 generator. The parts of the generator were old and had exceeded the maximum repair period. This overhaul began in early March and was scheduled to be completed by the end of this month, but due to the lack of tools and the smaller number of people participating in the repair work than planned, and some parts were too old, it was found that they needed to be replaced after the repair. Therefore, only eight-tenths of the scheduled project for the month was completed by the end of March. Since April, in order to strive to complete the project on schedule and welcome "May Day," the workers have automatically worked overtime for one hour every day at noon to rush the repair. After half a month of intensive assault, it is no longer a problem to complete the project before the end of the month. The workers of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Pingjin Railway Bureau are using their spare time to rush to build a streamlined new locomotive to welcome "May Day," and plan to complete it before the end of April.
(This newspaper reported) All the staff of Beiping Telecommunications Bureau and North China Highway Administration established a preparatory committee recently, in order to greet "May Day" and "May Fourth".

　　北平市各公营企业职工
    加班生产迎接“五一”
  　门头沟采煤效率打破纪录
    【新华社北平十九日电】为了迎接解放后的第一个“五一”劳动节，北平市公营企业职工纷纷展开生产竞赛运动。平郊门头沟、城子、西山三大公营煤矿在完成了一至三月共采煤九万四千吨的计划后。又在四月份展开生产大竞赛来迎接“五一”。门头沟煤矿发动竞赛以来，产量大大提高。四月上旬该矿井下采煤工较解放前减少一千三百九十一人，产量却较解放前增加了七百八十三吨。平均采煤工效率为一点一六吨，打破了该矿三十年来的采煤纪录。西山煤矿计划在四月份产煤一万吨，现全矿职工正紧张生产中。城子煤矿职工则决定要在节省材料的条件下争取更多的产量。冀北电力公司北平分公司于四月一日开始的抢修城外线路的生产竞赛运动，至十八日已经完成了三分之二。全部抢修工作将于二十四日前完成。工人们在抢修中情绪极高，每天都是早出晚归，中午也减少休息时间，这样每天平均要多做两小时以上的工作。北平电车公司修造厂工人发起的迎接“五一”出车百辆运动，已经提前完成计划。现每天行驶于各线的电车已增至八十辆。厂内尚存好车二十五辆，随时均可出动。其中有新式电车四辆，已经油饰一新，并分别命名为“北平解放号”，“生产号”，“劳动号”，“人民号”，定“五一”节开出行驶。在赶修车辆过程中，各班工人均自动加工，互相帮助，因此没有一班不超过预定计划。石景山发电厂维护股汽机部工人，在修复三号发电机时，也热烈响应用生产竞赛迎接“五一”的号召，自动加班工作。该发电机机件陈旧，且已超过了最大的应修年限，这次大修于三月初开始，预定本月底完工，但由于工具缺乏，参加修理工作的人又较计划为少，而且若干机件太旧，修好后发现还需重换，因此三月底只完成该月预定工程的十分之八。自四月份起，为了争取如期完成，迎接“五一”，职工们便每日中午自动加班一小时赶修。在持续半个月的紧张突击之后，在月底前完工已不成问题。平津铁路局丰台机务段职工正以工余时间突击一台迎接“五一”的流线型新式机车，计划在四月底以前完成。
    【本报讯】北平市电讯局、华北公路总局全体职工，为迎接“五一”及“五四”，于日前成立筹备委员会。
