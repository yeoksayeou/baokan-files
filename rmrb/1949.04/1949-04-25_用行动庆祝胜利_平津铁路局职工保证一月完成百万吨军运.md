　　Celebrating Victory with Action
    Employees of the Pingjin Railway Bureau Pledge to Complete One Million Tons of Military Transportation in One Month
    [Our Dispatch] The news of the liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan immediately caused jubilation in various agencies such as the Pingjin Railway Bureau and the Postal Bureau. Applause, singing, and slogans rang out. When the news reached the Pingjin Railway Bureau, which was holding the inaugural meeting of the Youth League Committee, applause thundered instantly. The slogan "Long Live the Chinese People" boomed. The League Committee immediately issued a call to celebrate the liberation of Nanjing with practical actions, deciding to guarantee the completion of a plan for one million tons of military transport in one month. Employees also proposed working an extra hour each month. In addition to responding to the challenge from Shijingshan, they also challenged other business sectors. They guaranteed that the Youth League would take a leading role in the challenge competition. Each sub-bureau immediately convened a symposium to study specific work plans. Comrades of the transfer group of the third branch of the Beijing Postal Administration also held a group discussion after receiving the news of the liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan. Postal worker Comrade Zhou Yuanxiang proposed celebrating the victory of the liberation of Nanjing with practical actions. He said: In the past, it took half an hour to transport mail each time a train entered the station, but now it has been shortened to fifteen minutes, and it will not exceed ten minutes at most to transport it to the Administration. In terms of saving gasoline, cars were used to deliver mail regardless of the amount in the past, but now parcels under 30 bags are not delivered by car, but are pushed by hand trucks. Some comrades also suggested: When delivering letters to the train, we must also strive for every second. As long as the train does not leave in three or two minutes, we must run to deliver the mail. It is especially important to deliver newspapers quickly. In the past, mailboxes at the station were sent away fifteen minutes before the train departed, but now it will be shortened to within ten minutes so that more letters can be sent.

　　用行动庆祝胜利
    平津铁路局职工保证一月完成百万吨军运
    【本报讯】南京、太原解放的消息传来，平津铁路局、邮政局等各个机关中立即引起一片欢腾。掌声、歌声与口号声四起。当消息传达到平津铁路局时，该局正举行青年团团委会成立大会，立时掌声雷动。“中国人民万岁”的口号声轰响起来。团委会立即发出以实际行动庆祝南京解放的号召，决定在一个月里保证完成百万顿军事运输的计划。职工同志们并提出每月加工一小时。除了响应石景山的挑战以外，并向其他各企业部门挑战。保证青年团要在挑战竞赛中起带头的作用。各分局立即召开座谈会，研究具体的工作计划。北平邮政管理局第三支局转运组的同志，在接到南京和太原解放的消息后，也同样进行小组座谈。邮工周远祥同志提出要以实际行动来庆祝南京解放的胜利。他说：过去每次车进站时，搬运邮件花半小时，现在缩短到十五分钟最多不超过十十分钟最多不超过十十分就运到管理局。在节省汽油方面，过去不管邮件多少都用汽车送，现在在三十袋以下的邮包就不用汽车送了自己用小手车推。还有的同志提出：在向车上送信时，也要争取一分一秒的时间，只要三两发钟不开车，有邮包也得跑步送上车去。尤其送新闻纸更要迅速。车站上的信箱过去在开车前十五分钟就送走了，现在要缩到十分钟以内，便能多送去些信件。
