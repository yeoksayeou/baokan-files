　　Liulihe Cement Plant Officially Begins Operation
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 17th】 The Liulihe Cement Plant, the second largest in North China, officially began operations on the 16th. At the opening ceremony held at 6:00 AM on the 16th, the military representative of the plant called on everyone to work hard with the attitude of being masters of their own affairs and to complete the task of producing 10,000 tons of cement in three months. Subsequently, the workers spoke one after another in response to the military representative's call. The Liulihe Cement Plant was established during the Japanese occupation. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was taken over by the Kuomintang government and reorganized into the Liulihe Plant of the North China Cement Company. It was shut down for half a year and did not resume operations until April of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946). After being taken over by the Beiping Municipal Materials Takeover Committee on December 15th of last year, it immediately began repair work. Due to the timely strengthening of employee education, which raised the class consciousness of all 300-plus employees of the plant, the plant was able to rely on the workers' new work attitude and production enthusiasm to complete all preparatory work and officially begin operations as scheduled.

　　琉璃河水泥厂正式开工
    【新华社北平十七日电】位居华北第二的琉璃河水泥厂已于十六日正式开工。在十六日晨六时举行的开工典礼大会上，该厂军事代表号召大家用主人翁的态度努力生产，完成三个月生产洋灰一万吨的任务。接着工人们纷纷发言响应军事代表的号召。琉璃河水泥厂系日寇占领时期所开设，抗战胜利后由国民党政府接收，改组为华北水泥公司琉璃河厂。其间停工半年，延至民国三十五年四月始行开工。去年十二月十五日由北平市物资接管委员会接管后，即积极从事修理工作。由于及时加强职工教育，提高了全厂三百余职工的阶级觉悟，该厂得以依靠工人新的劳动态度和生产热情完成了一切准备工作，如期正式开工。
