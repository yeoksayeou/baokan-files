Comrade Bo Yibo, in his speech at the North China New Democratic Youth League Congress, first briefly explained the current situation in North China and that the focus of future work should shift from rural areas to cities. He immediately pointed out that all young people should actively participate in the transformation and construction of cities. He proposed that the most important task for cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, and Baoding is to restore and develop production, turning consumer cities into productive cities, and that the issue of production should be considered on the very first day of entering the city. This includes first restoring public and private enterprises, then organizing production in government organs, developing handicraft factories, and machine factories, and allowing the employment of labor; however, government organs should not engage in commercial production. Secondly, to enable all people in the city to participate in production, we must carry out a "greening campaign" in the city and suburbs, planting vegetables and promoting horticulture. If production cannot be organized, the people's regime cannot be consolidated, and all work in the city should revolve around production.

In the city, another important task is to mobilize and organize all working people, industrial workers, handicraft workers, shop assistants, coolies, staff members of government and Party organs, teachers, and even students, to organize their own trade unions according to their respective industries and form their own general trade unions. If this is achieved, most people in the city can be included. This is the foundation and backbone of the people's regime. If all workers, working people, and revolutionary intellectuals in the city cannot be organized, the people's regime will suffer from osteomalacia. Some people, after entering the city, do not first mobilize and organize workers, all working people, and revolutionary intellectuals, but instead rely on so-called "upper-class elements," which is dangerous. In addition, solving the land problem in the suburbs is also very important. The city is a cultural center and should run schools well under possible and necessary conditions. Comrade Bo Yibo then explained the principles of New Democracy's economic construction in detail, and then put forward the tasks of the North China Youth League in the future.

The general task is to develop production and support the front. Production is the overriding central task, and the Youth League's task is the same. It should obey this general task and stand with all young people in their own jobs to promote production. Young people in rural areas should play a leading role in production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and transportation undertakings; young people in cities should play a leading role in factories, railways, and mines, and strive for more model workers and labor heroes.

Secondly, young people should universally carry out political and class education among workers, revolutionary intellectuals, and peasants. For example, in newly liberated cities, a political education movement should be launched: who built the houses, who wove the cloth, who built the railways...? Everything is created by workers and peasants, that is, by labor, but in the old society, the fruits created by labor could not be enjoyed by themselves, but were taken away by parasites who lived a life of ease and comfort without labor, which is unreasonable. Therefore, the old society must be transformed. Finally, he pointed out that young people should produce and learn simultaneously. They should study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, that is, they should combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution.

### 薄一波同志号召华北青年　一面生产一面学习

　　薄一波同志号召华北青年　一面生产一面学习
    【本报讯】薄一波同志在华北新青团代表大会上的讲话，首先简单地说明了目前华北所处的情况及今后工作重心，应该由乡村转入城市之后，立即指出所有青年应该积极参加改造和建设城市的工作。他提出目前城市象北平、天津、唐山、张家口、保定等城市，头等重要任务就是恢复和发展生产，把消费的城市变为生产的城市，进城的头一天就应该注意这一个生产问题。这中间首先是恢复公营企业和私营企业，其次组织机关生产，发展手工业工厂，机器工厂，允许雇庸劳动；但机关不应进行商业生产。复次，要使城市所有人民均能参加生产，我们要在市内和郊区进行一个“绿化运动”，种植蔬菜，提倡园艺。如果组织不起生产来，人民政权就不可能巩固，城市中的一切工作都应该围绕着生产去进行。
    在城市中间，再一件重要的工作，就是发动和组织一切劳动人民、产业工人、手工业工人、店员、苦力、政府和党机关中的工作人员、教职员、甚至学生，均应按各行各业组织自己的工会，并组成自己的总工会，如果做到这一步，大体上城市中的大部份人就都可以包括进去了。这就是人民政权的基础和骨干。不能把城市中的一切工人，劳动人民和革命知识分子组织起来，人民政权就会害软骨病。有些人进城后不是首先去发动和组织工人，一切劳动人民和革命知识分子，而是去依靠所谓“上层分子”，这是危险的。此外解决郊区的土地问题也是很重要的。城市是文化中心，应在可能与必需的条件下，把学校教育办好。一波同志接着详尽地解释了新民主主义经济建设的方针后，提出今后华北青年团的任务。
    总的任务是发展生产，支援前线，生产是压倒一切的中心任务，青年团的任务也是一样，应该服从这个总任务，应该跟所有青年站在自己的工作岗位上促进生产。农村的青年要在生产合作社、互助组、运输事业中；城市的青年应在工厂、铁路、矿山中均应起带头作用，争取更多的模范工作者和劳动英雄。
    其次，青年应该在工人中，在革命知识分子中，在农民中，普遍地进行政治教育和阶级教育，比如，在新解放的城市中，应发动一个政治教育运动，房子是谁盖的，布是谁织的，铁路是谁建筑的……所有一切，都是工人和农民，就是说劳动所创造的，但是在旧社会里，劳动所创造的成果，自己不能享用，反被寄生虫夺去了，他们过着不劳而优裕的生活，这是不合理的，因之旧社会必须改造。最后他指出青年们应该是一面生产，一面学习。要学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，就是说要做到把马列主义的普遍真理与中国革命的实践相结合。
