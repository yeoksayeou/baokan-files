Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: Prague dispatch: The Prague Peace Congress concluded on the evening of the 25th, simultaneously with the Paris Congress, after holding its final meeting. Before closing, the delegates unanimously adopted the full text of the World Peace Congress Declaration. When Chairman Ďuriš announced that the declaration had been adopted, the entire venue erupted in thunderous cheers. Following this, Simonov spoke, representing the Chinese and Soviet delegations, proposing that gratitude be expressed to the Czechoslovak National Assembly and government for their warm reception of the delegates. This proposal was unanimously adopted by the delegates.

Ďuriš, in his speech at the close of the meeting, urged all delegates and peace fighters worldwide to mobilize all their strength to implement the declaration of the World Peace Congress and guarantee a lasting and democratic peace.

Two hundred and seventy-six delegates participated in the Prague Peace Congress, representing people's organizations from sixteen countries and the World Student Federation.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: Paris dispatch: The Paris Peace Congress, after six days of meetings, listening to the speeches of representatives from seventy-two countries representing six hundred million organized people defending world peace, deciding to establish a permanent committee of the World Peace Congress, and passing a declaration to all people of the world, concluded its work on the evening of April 25th.

At the meeting on the 25th, the Italian People's Delegation, composed of representatives from women's, trade union, youth, and other democratic groups, paid tribute to the congress and presented to the presidium a copy of a letter to U.S. President Truman, signed by prominent leaders of the Italian Democratic Women's Movement, and a "Peace Register" with hundreds of thousands of signatures protesting the North Atlantic Treaty. At the evening meeting, the French delegation and the Trieste Women's Delegation paid tribute to the congress. The French delegation presented to the presidium many packages containing millions of signatures of French men and women on the "Fighters for Peace and Freedom Society's" letter to Truman, signatures defending peace in the "Peace Register," and resolutions from working people opposing warmongers and supporting peace. The letter to Truman protested the U.S.'s war preparation policy and U.S. imperialism's infringement on French independence. The Trieste delegation presented the congress with a red flag embroidered with the gold lettering: "The families of Trieste dedicate this to the World Peace Congress."

The famous Spanish painter Pablo Picasso read a proposal to the congress committee, advocating the establishment of an annual peace prize to reward outstanding works in art, literature, and film that contribute to strengthening peace, which was unanimously adopted.

Louis Aragon, chairman of the drafting committee for the World Peace Congress Declaration, read the draft declaration to all people of the world. Before reading it, Aragon said: Our declaration is a plan that defines the basic guidelines for constructing the future edifice of peace. It proves that people with different beliefs agree on fundamental principles. We have seen the huge response the World Peace Congress has generated worldwide. At this congress, we represent more than one-third of all humanity, and through this declaration, we appeal to the people of all countries to strive for the participation of the rest of humanity in defending peace. All participants passed the congress declaration with prolonged, stormy applause and shouts of approval.

The congress passed a resolution to establish a permanent committee of the World Peace Congress and approved the composition of the permanent committee.

Chairman Fajon announced materials regarding the composition of the congress. He said that two thousand and five delegates participated in the congress, representing seventy-two countries.

Fajon, the French representative and chairman of this meeting, delivered the closing remarks, saying: The extraordinary unity during the congress proves that, despite the different beliefs of the delegates, complete agreement can still be reached. The resolutions adopted by the congress have world-historical significance. Yesterday, you saw the real France at Buffalo Stadium. The characteristic of those who want war is cowardice; those with courage and determination, those who declare their support for and desire to participate in the World Peace Congress, will win peace in any case. We will convey the opinions of the congress to all people. I declare the World Peace Congress closed, and I say to you: Goodbye! The congress sang the Marseillaise, and the entire hall resounded with cheers again.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th: Prague dispatch: After the Prague Peace Congress closed on the evening of the 25th, Prague workers immediately held a mass rally of 15,000 people at the Prague Industrial Hall, which was attended by representatives of the Peace Congress. Chinese representatives spoke at the meeting, pointing out that the great victory of the Chinese people will strengthen world peace. This speech aroused enthusiastic cheers from the masses. Speeches by representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, Bulgaria, and other countries also aroused cheers. D'Astier, one of the members of the Presidium of the Paris Peace Congress, spoke last, pointing out that the peace congresses in Paris and Prague both demonstrated the will for peace of hundreds of millions of people.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th: TASS Paris dispatch: The resolution of the World Peace Congress on establishing an annual peace prize stated: To encourage the efforts of cultural workers in defending peace, the World Peace Congress decided to establish an international peace prize to award the best films, literary works, and artistic works that contribute to strengthening peace among the people of all countries.

The Peace Congress will establish three international peace prizes, each prize amounting to five million francs. The World Peace Congress calls on all groups and organizations participating in the congress to conduct fundraising to raise funds for the international peace prize.
