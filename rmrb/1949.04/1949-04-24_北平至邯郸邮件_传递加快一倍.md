　　Mail Delivery from Beiping to Handan
  　Speeds Up by One Fold
    [Our Dispatch] The delivery time for mail between Beiping and Handan has been accelerated by one fold. Previously, mail from Beiping to Shijiazhuang took four days, and to Handan, seven days. Recently, as transportation has gradually recovered, the Beiping Postal Administration consulted with the Highway Bureau and, starting April 18th, allocated six dedicated automobiles for round trips, along with two reserve vehicles, to accelerate mail delivery on this route by one fold. Mail from Beiping to Shijiazhuang now takes only two days, and to Handan, only three days.

　　北平至邯郸邮件
  　传递加快一倍
    【本报讯】北平至邯郸邮件传递时间，已加快一倍。过去北平至石家庄邮件需走四天，至邯郸需七天，近因交通逐渐恢复，北平邮政管理局即与公路局商讨，从四月十八日起专拨六辆汽车对开，两辆备补车，使该线邮件传递时间加快一倍。北平至石家庄邮件只需两天，至邯郸只需三天。
