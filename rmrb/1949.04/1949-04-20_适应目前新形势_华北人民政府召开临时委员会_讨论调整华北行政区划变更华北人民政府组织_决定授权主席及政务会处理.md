　　Adapting to the Current New Situation
  　North China People's Government Holds Provisional Committee Meeting
    Discussing Adjustment of North China's Administrative Divisions and Changes to the Organization of the North China People's Government
  　Decides to Authorize the Chairman and Government Affairs Council to Handle Matters
    [Report from this newspaper] The North China People's Government held a provisional meeting of the Government Committee on the 16th of this month to discuss the changes to the current administrative divisions of North China and the work of the government. The government committee members present were Dong Biwu, Bo Yibo, Lan Gongwu, Yang Xiufeng, Nie Rongzhen, Xie Juezai, Chen Jinkun, Yu Li, Xing Zhaotang, Wang Fuchu, Xu Zheng, Fan Wenlan, Cheng Fangwu, Zhang Su, and others, totaling nineteen people (eight were excused). Those attending as observers included heads of various departments of the North China People's Government and heads of various administrative offices: Pan Fusheng, Han Zheyuan (Ji-Lu-Yu), Lü Hong'an (Taihang), Luo Yuchuan (Jizhong), Niu Peicong (Taiyue), Li Gengtao (Jidong), Fan Ruoyi (Jinan), and Chairman of Suiyuan-Mongolia Yan Xiufeng, totaling more than thirty people. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Dong Biwu reported on the current situation and the work that the North China People's Government urgently needs to prepare for. Chairman Dong first pointed out that the national revolutionary situation is developing victoriously and rapidly, and victory on a national scale is in sight. Based on this situation, Chairman Dong proposed that the North China People's Government now needs to consider two issues: one is the current administrative divisions of North China, considering adjustments based on the original provincial divisions; the second is the possible changes to the organizational structure of the North China People's Government. The second part of Chairman Dong's speech concerned current government work. First, how to implement Chairman Mao's call for "increasing production by an inch." The government has formulated an economic construction plan, requiring all localities to do their utmost to "increase production by an inch" according to local conditions, and to cultivate more special crops for industrial production. To this end, it is necessary to investigate soil properties, fertilizers, seeds, transportation, and other conditions to make specific plans. Second, people's representative conferences at all levels should be organized according to the needs of the people. The methods should be simple and easy to implement, so that the people feel they have the power to do things. Various regions can first try it out in a few areas. Third, the issue of surviving the famine: Due to floods and droughts last year, some areas are experiencing spring famine this year due to the gap between the exhaustion of the old harvest and the ripening of the new. We have survived famines in history that were even more serious than this. As long as our leadership pays attention, organizes and leads production well, and makes good use of past experience in surviving famines, we will be able to overcome this spring famine. Fourth, the issue of public security: Currently, there are many scattered soldiers in various parts of North China, as well as some disbanded Kuomintang troops and landlords and rich peasants returning to their hometowns. We must start by organizing production to provide them with a way to make a living, otherwise disturbances to public security will occur. At the same time, we should strengthen the organization of the militia to ensure local public security. Fifth, in order to strengthen the relationship between higher and lower levels, it is necessary to establish and improve future meeting, inspection, and reporting systems, especially the reporting system must be adhered to. Next, Committee Member Nie Rongzhen spoke, saying that there may still be small groups of scattered soldiers and political bandits hiding in areas near the battlefield. Some areas are experiencing spring famine, and there are also a considerable number of opium smokers in Yanbei. If these problems are not resolved, they will affect our production and construction. Therefore, the public security problems arising from the economy should be resolved through production and disaster relief; the public security problems arising from politics should be resolutely eliminated. Opium smokers can be forced to quit and sent to drug rehabilitation centers. Ban secret societies and gambling. Scattered soldiers should be concentrated and organized into regiments, with good disabled soldiers managing them. Organized efforts should be made to manage rivers and build water conservancy projects to gradually reform them. During the discussion, Committee Member Lan Gongwu proposed that there is an area south of Tianjin where scattered soldiers, beggars, and others from various places can be concentrated for cultivation. The government can allocate some money to solve the problems of agricultural tools, livestock, seeds, and so on. Committee Member Song Shaowen proposed a temporary motion, saying that due to the development of the situation, national victory is in sight, and major changes in the situation may occur at any time in the future. In order to handle urgent tasks, it is proposed to authorize the Chairman and Government Affairs Council of this government to handle urgent matters concerning the adjustment of North China's administrative divisions and changes to the organizational powers of various departments of this government. Committee Members Xie Juezai and Xing Zhaotang were the first to express their agreement. Committee Member Xing Zhaotang also proposed that under the new situation this year, we should vigorously prevent floods. This year's river management project requires "the combination of technology and politics" and "the combination of technology and the masses." At this point in the meeting, Committee Members Song Shaowen, Cheng Fangwu, and Yu Li were immediately nominated to review the proposal on adjusting administrative divisions and changing the organization of the North China People's Government, and to draft a draft resolution. After lunch, the meeting was temporarily adjourned, and the committee members exchanged views extensively on the issue of changing administrative divisions and government work. The meeting continued at 2:00 p.m. Committee Member Yang Xiufeng put forward important opinions on the issues of banning opium, banning gambling, and dealing with scattered soldiers, vagrants, and beggars, saying that the government is concentrating its efforts on solving this problem and that it can be done as long as they are given good economic support. He requested that relief loans be increased within the limits of financial resources, with a fixed repayment period. Committee Member Chen Jinkun also expressed his agreement on the issue of reorganizing North China's administrative divisions and changing the organization of various departments of the government. After the committee members spoke successively, Chairman Dong answered the opinions of the committee members and instructed the government departments to consult with the heads of the administrative offices, provinces, and cities separately after the meeting for implementation. Finally, regarding the issue of authorizing the Chairman and Government Affairs Council to handle changes to North China's current administrative divisions and government organizational structure, the resolution drafted by Committee Members Song, Yu, and Cheng (see separate article) was submitted for discussion and unanimously passed by all committee members. In order to implement the spirit of this meeting, the provisional committee nominated five committee members, Bo Yibo, Xing Zhaotang, Lan Gongwu, Xie Juezai, and Song Shaowen, to review issues related to changes in the government structure, with Bo Yibo as the convener. Another five committee members, Yang Xiufeng, Yu Li, Rong Zihe, Zhang Su, and Chao Zhefu, were nominated to be responsible for reviewing issues related to changes in North China's current administrative divisions, with Yang Xiufeng as the convener. At this point, the meeting officially closed.

    【本报讯】华北人民政府于本月十六日召开政府委员会临时会议，讨论关于华北现行行政区划的变更及政府工作等问题。出席政府委员董必武、薄一波、蓝公武、杨秀峰、聂荣臻、谢觉哉、陈瑾琨、于力、邢肇棠、王复初、徐正、范文澜、成仿吾、张苏等十九人（请假者八人）。列席者有华北人民政府各部门负责人，及各行署主任：潘复生、韩哲一（冀鲁豫），吕鸿安（太行），罗玉川（冀中），牛佩琮（太岳），李耕涛（冀东），范若一（冀南）及绥蒙主席阎秀峰等三十余人。会议开始，首由董必武主席报告目前形势及关系到华北人民政府急应准备的工作，董主席首先指出：全国革命形势正在胜利地迅速发展，全国范围的胜利在望。基于这一形势，董主席提出华北人民政府现在就需要考虑两个问题：一个是目前华北行政区划，考虑在原有的省的区划基础上加以调整的问题；二是华北人民政府组织机构可能变更的问题。董主席讲话的第二部份，是目前政府工作问题。首先是如何执行毛主席生产长一寸的号召，政府已订出了一个经济建设的计划，要求各地根据当地情况做到尽可能长一寸，多种特种作物，供工业生产之用。为此必须考察土地性能、肥料、种子、运输等条件，具体计划。第二、关于各级人民代表会议应根据人民的需要来组织，办法要简单，易行，使人民感到有权力能办事，各地区可先找几个地区试办。第三、渡荒问题：因去年水旱为灾，今年有几个地区因青黄不接，发生春荒，必须从生产救灾中来渡过。历史上比这严重的灾荒我们都渡过了，只要我们领导上注意，好好组织领导生产，好好利用过去度荒的经验，这次春荒必能渡过。第四、治安问题：目前华北各地很多流散军人，还有一部份遣散的国民党部队，及还乡的地主富农，必须从组织生产着手，使他们生活有出路，否则就会发生扰乱治安的现象。同时应加强民兵的组织，确保地方治安。第五、为密切上下级之间的关系，必须建立与健全今后会议、巡视及报告制度，尤其报告制度必须坚持。接着聂荣臻委员发言，他说：在战场附近还可能有小股流散军人及政治土匪，有计划的隐蔽下来。有些地区春荒，雁北的烟民也有相当大的数量，这些问题如不解决，就会影响我们的生产建设。因此，从经济上产生的治安问题，应从生产救灾中来解决；从政治上产生的治安问题，应坚决加以消灭。对烟民可以实行强迫禁戒，送到戒烟所去。禁止会门及赌博，流散军人应将其集中起来组织成团，找好的残废军人去管理，有组织的去进行治河、修水利，以逐渐改造。在讨论中，蓝委员公武提出：现在天津以南有一块地区，可以集中各地流散军人、乞丐等去耕种，政府可以拿出一部分钱来，解决农具、牲口、种子等问题。宋劭文委员提出临时动议，他说：由于形势的发展，全国胜利在望，今后形势的重大变化随时都可能发生，为了处理紧急任务，提议授权本府主席及政务会议，处理关于调整华北行政区划及变更本府各部门组织职权等紧要事宜。谢觉哉委员及邢肇棠委员首先表示同意。邢肇棠委员并提出：今年在新形势下，应大力防汛，今年的治河工程，要求“技术与政治结合”、“技术与群众结合”。会议至此，当即推定宋劭文、成仿吾、于力三委员审查关于调整行政区划及变更华北人民政府组织的提议，并起草决议草案。午饭后，暂告休会，各委员就变更行政区划及政府工作问题，广泛交换意见。午后二时继续开会，杨秀峰委员对禁烟、禁赌、处理散兵游勇、乞丐等问题，提出重要意见，他说：政府正集中力量解决这一问题，只要经济上给他们很好的支援，就能办到。他要求在财政力量可能范围内，增加救济粮贷，规定期限归还。陈瑾琨委员亦对整顿华北行政区划及变更本府各部门组织问题表示同意。在各委员相继发言之后，董主席即分别解答各委员意见，并责成政府各部门在会后与各行署、省、市负责人，分别会商执行。最后关于授权政府主席及政务会议处理变更华北现行行政区划及政府组织机构问题，根据宋、于、成三委员起草的决议（见另文）交付讨论，全体委员一致表决通过。为贯彻此次会议精神，临时委员会又推举薄一波、邢肇棠、蓝公武、谢觉哉、宋劭文等五委员核议有关变更政府机构问题，以薄一波为召集人。另推举杨秀峰、于力、戎子和、张苏、晁哲甫五委员负责核议有关变更华北现行行政区划事宜，以杨秀峰为召集人。至此会议即正式闭幕。
