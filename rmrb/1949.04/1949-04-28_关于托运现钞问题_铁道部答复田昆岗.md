    Regarding the issue of transporting cash
    The Ministry of Railways' reply to Tian Kun'gang
    Comrade Tian Kun'gang: Regarding the dispute that occurred on March 2nd at Tianjin East Station when you were transporting cash, the results of the investigation are as follows:
    After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, the Ministry of Railways had just been established, and all passenger and freight transportation regulations had not been stipulated in detail in a timely manner. In addition to several provisions in principle, the remaining rules still followed the old ones. Therefore, the transportation of cash was based on the regulations of the pseudo-Pingjin Railway Bureau, which limited passengers carrying large amounts of cash on passenger trains to 20 kilograms per item. Furthermore, before the liberation of Tianjin, the pseudo-Financial Administration Bureau and the Investigation Division of the pseudo-Tianjin Garrison Command restricted the outflow of cash and notified Tianjin East Station to request passengers carrying large amounts of cash to provide supporting documents from the competent authorities, for the purpose of inspection by military and police authorities. The employee handling the matter accepted the regulations of the pseudo-era without analysis, and the duty station master, Bao Deyong, unaware of the truth, used the Railway Department's order as a pretext to give you a written reply, all of which were mistakes. However, after this case occurred, the handling employee, station master, etc., have understood that supporting documents are no longer required for carrying large amounts of currency, and it can be accepted for transport. In addition to providing appropriate education to the relevant personnel responsible for the improper handling, we extend our apologies. We also hope that you will provide more feedback in the future.

### 关于托运现钞问题　铁道部答复田昆岗

　　关于托运现钞问题
  　铁道部答复田昆岗
    田昆岗同志：你在天津东站三月二日托运现钞发生纠葛事件，经调查结果，答复如下：
    平津解放后，铁道部甫告成立，所有一切客货运输规则没能及时详细规定。除在原则上规定几项以外，其他仍援用旧有规则。因此托运现钞是根据伪平津区铁路局规定，旅客携带大量现钞乘坐客车，限以二十公斤一件。并按天津解放前，伪金融管理局及伪天津警备司令部稽查处限制现钞外流，曾通知天津东站对于携运大量现钞之旅客，须向其索取主管机关证明文件，留备军警机关检查。该办事员工未加分析的接受了伪时代规章，值班站长鲍德永不明真象，率以铁道处命令为词，给你书面答复，均属错误。但于此案发生后，该经办员工站长等已经了解现在对于携运大量钞币已不再索要证明文件，即可承运。除对该办理失当之有关人员予以适当的教育外，谨致歉意。并希今后多多提供意见。
