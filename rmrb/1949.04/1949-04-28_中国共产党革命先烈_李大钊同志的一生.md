　　Revolutionary Martyr of the Chinese Communist Party
    Comrade Li Dazhao's Life
    Today (April 28th) is the twenty-first anniversary of the martyrdom of Comrade Li Dazhao, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party. Twenty-one years ago today, Comrade Dazhao was strangled to death in Beiping by the Fengtian warlord Zhang Zuolin. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people inherited his great legacy and continued the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Now, the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government has collapsed, and the New Democratic Revolution is about to triumph throughout the country. To commemorate Comrade Dazhao and to learn from his revolutionary life under these circumstances is of great educational significance to us.
    Comrade Dazhao was born in the fourteenth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1888). He studied at the Beiyang School of Law and Politics and Waseda University in Japan. He returned to China from Japan in 1911 and served as the chief editor of the Beijing Chenzhong (Morning Bell) Daily. From 1914, when Yuan Shikai colluded with Japanese寇(imperialists) in a conspiracy to restore the monarchy, Comrade Dazhao participated in the ranks of the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism with practical actions. He used newspapers and public speeches to establish the banner of opposing Yuan's稱帝(claiming the title of Emperor) and openly opposing the traitorous Twenty-One Demands. Comrade Dazhao was the direct leader and organizer of the "May Fourth" Movement, which broke out in Beijing in 1919. At that time, he served as the librarian of Peking University and taught courses such as sociology, economics, and historical materialism. He usually paid attention to conducting ideological education of national revolution among students. Peking University became the backbone of the "May Fourth" Movement, which was inseparable from the education he usually carried out.
    Since studying in Japan, Comrade Dazhao had been committed to studying Marxism-Leninism. The economics he taught at Peking University was based on Marx's economic theory. In 1920, he organized socialist research groups and communist groups in various schools in Beiping. When the Chinese Communist Party was founded in July 1921, he became the founder and leader of the party in the North.
    On March 18, 1926, the struggle of students in Beiping against the Japanese imperialists' collusion with Zhang Zuolin in attacking Tianjin was personally participated in and directed by Comrade Dazhao. The bloody massacre carried out by the reactionary Duan Qirui government at Tiananmen did not subdue the people's will to oppose imperialism and feudalism. Treading on the bloodstains of the "March 18th" incident, Comrade Dazhao continued to stay in Beiping and persist in the struggle. In April 1927, when the movement to slaughter Communists directed by Chiang Kai-shek was being launched across the country, Comrade Dazhao was arrested on the 6th. More than 20 people, including Tan Zuyou, Lu Yougong, and Li Kun, were also arrested. On April 28th, Comrade Dazhao was strangled to death by the reactionary Zhang Zuolin government. Comrade Dazhao calmly delivered his last speech on the inevitable victory of communism before his execution. The great spirit of a Communist Party member demonstrated by Comrade Dazhao at the time of his martyrdom left an indelible impression on the people.
    On April 23, 1933, friends of Comrade Dazhao during his lifetime initiated a public funeral for Comrade Dazhao. Thousands of students, workers, and citizens participated in the funeral procession. Everyone painfully remembered the deceased. Many people shed tears while indignantly shouting slogans such as "Down with Japanese imperialism!" and "Down with the reactionary Kuomintang government!" The funeral procession was dispersed, but it automatically reassembled. The elegy presented to him by the young people read: "Struggling for the revolution, sacrificing for the revolution, death is without regret; living under oppression, groaning under oppression, how can the living endure!" This is the deep emotion expressed by the people for Comrade Dazhao, because Comrade Dazhao's life and death were closely linked to the people's urgent demands for anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism.

### 中国共产党革命先烈  李大钊同志的一生

　　中国共产党革命先烈
    李大钊同志的一生
    今天（四月二十八日）为中国共产党的创始人之一——李大钊同志殉难的二十一周年。二十一年前的今天，大钊同志被奉系军阀张作霖在北平绞杀了。中国共产党和中国人民继承他的伟大遗志，继续反帝反封建反官僚资本的斗争；现在，南京国民党反动政府已经溃灭，新民主主义革命就要在全国胜利了。在这种情况下来纪念大钊同志，来学习他革命的一生，对我们是有极大教育意义的。
    大钊同志生于清光绪十四年（一八八八年）曾先后就举于北洋法政专门学校及日本早稻田大学，一九一一年自日本回国，任北京晨钟报主任编辑。从一九一四年袁世凯勾结日寇阴谋恢复帝制时起，大钊同志即以实际行动参加了中国人民反帝反封建斗争的行列，利用报纸及公开讲演，树立反袁称帝的旗帜，公开反对卖国的二十一条。一九一九年在北京爆发的“五四”运动，大钊同志是直接领导者与组织者。当时他担任北京大学的图书馆长，并教授社会学、经济学及唯物史观等课程。平时在学生中注意进行民族革命的思想教育。北大成为“五四”运动的骨干，和他平时所进行的教育是分不开的。
    大钊同志从在日本留学时起，即曾致力于马克思列宁主义的学习，他在北大所讲授的经济学，即是以马克思的经济学说为基础的。一九二○年，他在北平各学校组织了社会主义研究组，共产主义小组。一九二一年七月中国共产党创建，他成为北方党的创始者和领导者。
    一九二六年三月十八日，北平学生所进行的反对日寇勾结张作霖进攻天津的斗争，是由大钊同志亲自参加与亲自指挥的。反动的段祺瑞执政府在天安门所进行的血腥参杀，并没有压服了人民反帝反封建的意志。踏着“三一八”的血迹，大钊同志继续留平坚持斗争。一九二七年四月，在蒋介石所指挥的屠杀共产党的运动在全国各地普遍开刀的时候，大钊同志于六日被捕。同时被捕的尚有谭祖尧、路友工、李昆等二十余人。四月二十八日，大钊同志被反动的张作霖政府所绞杀。大钊同志临刑时，曾从容发表共产主义必然胜利的最后一次演说。大钊同志殉难时所表现的这种共产党员的伟大气魄，留给人民以不能磨灭的印象。
    一九三三年四月二十三日，大钊同志之生前友好发起，为大钊同志举行公葬，成千成万的学生、工人、市民都参加了公葬的行列。大家沉痛地忆念死者，许多人一面流泪，一面激愤地高呼打倒日本帝国主义，打倒国民党反动政府的口号。送葬的队伍被打散了，又自动集合起来。青年们送给他的挽联上写着：“为革命而奋斗，为革命而牺牲，死固无恨；在压迫下生活，在压迫下呻吟，生者何堪！”这就是人民对大钊同志所表现的海样深的情感。因为大钊同志的生和死，都是和人民的迫切的反帝反封建要求密切结合着的。
