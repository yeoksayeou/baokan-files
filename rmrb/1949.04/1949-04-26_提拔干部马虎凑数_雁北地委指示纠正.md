　　Sloppy and Careless Promotion of Cadres to Fill Quotas
　　Yanbei Prefectural Committee Directs Correction
[Chahar News] Yanbei Sub-district's counties have adopted methods such as running training classes and individual selection, and in the past six months, a total of 933 new cadres have been promoted (including 103 female cadres), which has timely supplemented the shortage of cadres. However, in the promotion of cadres, there is a tendency in various places to be not cautious enough and to reluctantly fill quotas. Therefore, among the newly promoted cadres, there are a few who are of poor quality or incompetent, which not only affects the work, but also reduces the government's prestige among the masses. In the ninth district, a former Baojia chief who had been trying to avoid being struggled against by the masses was promoted to work in the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and was allowed to take a gun to withdraw funds. After traveling for many days, he spent all the funds he had withdrawn and used up the twenty rounds of ammunition he was carrying, and was later dismissed and sent home. The eleventh district of Hunyuan did not carefully cultivate and promote individuals, but instead assigned quotas to the villages. As a result, the villages sent anyone they could find to the district, just to make up the numbers. For example, Qiaomaichuan Village sent a former puppet soldier who had been released after being captured. Some cadres in Yanggao did not treat some oppressed child brides as a social problem, and instead of actively improving their family relationships and relieving their suffering, they simply thought that promoting them to be cadres would solve the problem, regardless of whether they were qualified. Five young girls aged sixteen or seventeen were promoted one after another, but in the end, they couldn't do anything (the prefectural committee and the prefectural women's federation have now notified Yanggao to mobilize them to return home, to solve their family problems well and relieve their suffering). In some areas of Datong, there has been a tendency to engage in emotional favoritism, and to promote anyone who is willing to come out, regardless of whether they are qualified, just to make up the numbers. In addition, not enough attention has been paid to the transformation and training of intellectuals. The prefectural committee pointed out that the above-mentioned tendencies are due to the leadership's lack of a serious and conscientious attitude towards the promotion of cadres, and the failure to pay attention to training in peacetime, so they are sloppy and careless in filling vacancies in times of urgent need. In the future, all counties must pay close attention to and correct this, and must especially strengthen the training and education of new cadres.

　　提拔干部马虎凑数
  　雁北地委指示纠正
    【察哈尔讯】雁北分区各县，采取开办训练班和个别选拔等方式，半年来，共提拔新干部九百三十三名（内妇女干部一百零三名），及时补充了干部的缺额。但各地在提拔干部中，有不够慎重，勉强充数的偏向。所以，在新提拔的干部中有少数品质不好或不称职的，不但影响了工作，还降低了政府在群众中的威信。九区将一个为躲避群众斗争的伪保甲长，提拔到工商局工作，让他带上枪去取款，走了多天，把所取的款也花完了，带的二十发子弹也打完了，后来才把他解职回家。浑源十一区不是慎重地去个别培养提拔，而是给村里布置数目。因之，村里就不管是什么人，都往区里送，硬凑数。如荞麦川村送了一个被俘释放回家的伪军。阳高某些干部对一些受压迫的童养媳，没把它当成社会问题看，不是积极地改善她们的家庭关系，解除她们的痛苦，简单地认为提拔当了干部就解决问题了，也不管够不够条件。先后提拔了五个十六七岁的小女孩子，结果啥也作不了（现地委与专区妇联已通知阳高动员她们回家，很好解决家庭问题，解除她们的痛苦）。大同某些地区发生了感情拉拢，和只要愿意出来也不管够不够条件，就可以提拔的凑数偏向。另外，对知识分子的改造培养注意不够。地委指出：以上这些偏向，是由于领导上对提拔干部缺乏严肃认真的态度，平时不注意培养，急用时就马虎凑数补缺。今后各县必须严加注意和纠正，并要特别加强新干部的培养教育。
