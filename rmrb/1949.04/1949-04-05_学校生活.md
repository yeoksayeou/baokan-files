    The Student Union Executive Committee Calls for the Establishment of Literacy Classes for Out-of-School Children
    ▲ The Executive Committee of the Beiping Student Union decided at a meeting on the 3rd: (1) Call on all schools in the city to establish literacy classes for out-of-school children as much as possible. Because only one-third of the total number of children in Beiping are in school, major middle school students have an obligation to assist in the education of the other two-thirds of impoverished children. This work should be carried out on the principle of not hindering on-campus study. In addition to fundraising by each school, the Municipal Education Bureau is requested to provide subsidies. (2) Protest against the Nanjing reactionary government's massacre of students and issue a declaration. On the same day, the Executive Committee conducted a detailed review and criticism of past work and staff. Everyone believes that the central task of the student movement, "study," has not been fully grasped. In the future, the central task of the Student Union and student unions of various schools should be to lead students throughout the city to launch a study craze centered on regular courses. (Student Union Secretariat)
    ▲ On the 4th, students of Chaoyang College divided all students on campus into 32 groups, each with three to five students. Every eight groups were formed into a team to conduct door-to-door propaganda among the residents of fifteen Bao in the Neisan district of Dafengsha, with a comparison of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the People's Government in various aspects as the main content, and to promote the clean-up campaign. (Chaoyang Correspondent Group)
    ▲ This semester, Yanjing University has more than 100 new transfer students. In addition to greeting them and helping them register for courses, the Student Self-Government Association led the new students to visit the entire Yanjing University on April 2nd, and requested the school to open the water tower. On the 3rd, there was also a welcome spring outing. About 200 new and old students took a train to the Great Wall. After returning to school in the afternoon, "Polish Guerrilla" was shown, free of charge to the new students.
    ▲ The organization of the Yanjing University Student Self-Government Association used to be based on the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers. Now the Legislative Committee has formed a constitution revision committee to formulate a new constitution for the Student Union based on the principle of democratic centralism. (Yanjing University Correspondent Group)
    ▲ Since the official start of learning at North China University on the 28th, after listening to Comrade Li Xin's lectures and the slow talks of old alumni from the Nangong Corps, most comrades have established a correct attitude towards learning. Some groups proposed "seize the time and don't waste every minute." (Wang Daying)
    ▲ The Student Union of the Municipal No. 2 Girls' Middle School has established a literacy class to help out-of-school impoverished children. The books and writing materials are all provided by the Student Union. Once the education service staff are hired, the class can begin.
    The second relief fund from the Student Union was distributed yesterday, with 640 yuan per person. The registration for poverty this time is stricter than the last time because this money is donated by the people.

　　学联执委号召举办　失学儿童识字班
    ▲北平学联执委会三日开会决议：（一）号召全市各校尽可能举办失学儿童识字班。因北平市就学儿童只有儿童总数的三分之一，另外三分之二贫苦儿童的教育，各大中学同学有协助的义务。此项工作愿在不妨碍校内学习的原则下进行。经费除由各校筹募外，请市教育局补助。（二）抗议南京反动政府屠杀学生，发表宣言。又同日执委会对过去工作与工作人员作了一个详尽的检讨和批评。大家认为对学运的中心任务“学习”未能充分掌握，今后学联及各校学生会的中心工作应该是领导全市同学展开以正课为中心的学习热潮。（学联秘书处）
    ▲朝阳学院同学于四日分全体在校同学为三十二小组，每组三人至五人，每八小组编成一队，在大风沙对内三区十五保市民以国民党反动派与人民政府的各方面对比为主要内容，作逐家访问式的宣传，推广清洁运动。（朝阳通讯组）
    ▲燕大本学期有一百多位编级生新同学，自治会除了招待他们、帮助他们注册选课外，并在四月二日带领新同学参观整个燕京，请学校开放了水塔。三日，又有迎新春游，二百左右新旧同学，集体乘火车到八达岭去旅行。下午回校后，映演“波兰游击队”，免费招待新同学。
    ▲燕大学生自治会的组织，以往是立法举行政分立的。现在立委会已组成了修改会章委员会，根据民主集中制原则，制定学生会新会章。（燕大通讯组）
    ▲华北大学自二十八日开始正式学习听了李新同志的讲课和南工团老校友的慢谈后，大多数同志已建立起正确的学习态度。有些组提出“抓紧时间，不浪费每一分钟”。（王大英）
    ▲市立女二中学生会为救济失学贫苦儿童，特成立识字班，书籍笔墨皆由学生会供给，待教育服务员聘妥后，即可开班。
    学联第二次救济金已于昨日发下，每人六百四十元，此次贫寒登记较上次更严，因为这些钱都是由人民捐出来的。
