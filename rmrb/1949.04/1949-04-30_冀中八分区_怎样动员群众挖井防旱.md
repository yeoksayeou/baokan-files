Jizhong Eighth District

How to Mobilize the Masses to Dig Wells for Drought Resistance

Reporter Chao Qi

The sowing season has arrived. The Jizhong Eighth District has still not received any rain. To complete this year's agricultural production increase plan, mobilizing the masses to find ways to prevent drought and dig wells for planting has become the most important aspect of current rural work. However, because most areas have lacked the habit of digging wells in the past, village cadres and the masses generally have a mentality of relying on the heavens. They mostly hold a negative attitude toward digging wells, emphasizing that the soil is unsuitable; or saying that digging wells is laborious and of little use, etc. The counties in the Jizhong Eighth District have solved these ideological problems through the following mobilization methods.

One: With the branch as the core, Party members unite and lead the masses.

Sanlizhuang in Jiahe First District is a village without a tradition of well-digging. When district cadres mentioned digging wells, the village cadres all said that digging an earthen well would take a lot of work and might not even be possible. In the discussion, they repeatedly explained that the basic task of Party members in the future is to lead the masses in production, so what should be done if planting is impossible due to drought? This gradually led to the understanding that only digging wells for planting could solve the problem, and they also recognized the benefits of digging wells. Their thinking was straightened out. For example, Party member and cadre Guo Shaoxian took the lead in organizing four people and dug an earthen well in two days. He then promoted the idea, saying: "Digging an earthen well doesn't take much effort. Four people can dig one in two days." Under his promotion and leadership, another twelve people were organized into three groups and dug three earthen wells, which led the whole village to focus on digging wells.

Two: Conduct in-depth investigations to dispel concerns.

(1) Use active members of the masses to educate the masses. After propaganda and education, it is necessary to grasp the active backbone elements among the masses to lead the backward. In Renlao Village, Jiahe, when the district cadres proposed digging wells, some people said: "It's all alkaline water, which cannot be used for irrigation." At that time, some of the masses explained, "The water is different in every third of an acre," "Even if alkaline water is drawn, the land is so dry that planting won't damage the land." The district cadres immediately supported this correct view. This broke the masses' stubborn idea that the water was bad and could not be used for irrigation, and thus they were unwilling to dig wells.

(2) Use the existing experience of the masses to educate the masses. Zhang Molong, an experienced old farmer from Duanzhuang Village in Jiahe, was used to promote to the masses, explaining: "I have been digging wells every year. This work is not difficult. When it is dry, I irrigate. Isn't my crop always better than others'?" This made the masses understand that digging an earthen well is not difficult, and the benefits are great. The whole village mobilized, and now 25 wells have been dug.

(3) Use concrete facts to educate the masses. In Yindian Village, Jiahe, the example of Cheng Jingzhang, who grew early-maturing crops and survived the spring famine, was used to educate everyone. At that time, he planted a few ridges of cowpeas, more than a dozen ditches of melons, and planted two fen of quick-maturing corn. In the spring, he only used one bag of millet and two bags of chaff, mixed with the planted melons and vegetables, to cover the grain needs, and his whole family survived the spring famine. He himself said: "I couldn't do without planting melons, vegetables, and quick-maturing corn that year. I will plant more this year." The masses then understood, and voluntarily dug wells and have now completed twelve.

(4) Use the painful lessons of the masses suffering from relying on the heavens to educate the masses. When a meeting was convened in Renlaoya Village, Jiahe, the masses were asked: "How is life?" "There is not enough food. Where did the disaster come from?" "Why did we starve and suffer in past famine years?" etc. The example of the western (Anguo area) regions using water for irrigation, where harvests could be reaped even without rain, was introduced. This connected the masses with their current vested interests, broke the masses' idea of relying on the heavens for food, and increased their confidence in digging wells. Eight wells have now been dug.

(5) Solve the difficulties of the masses in a timely manner and strengthen leadership in organizing well-digging. When mobilizing well-digging in Renhe Chentun Village (a total of 170 households), the masses had concerns that "one person cannot dig a well, and there is no money to entertain someone hired to help." The leadership seized this opportunity to organize the masses into partnerships for mutual assistance. The village has now organized 34 households, and 13 earthen wells have been dug in four days. In some villages in Renhe, Jiaoxiang, and Hejian, the masses believed that earthen wells would not hold in sandy soil. Later, after joint research with village cadres, it was discovered that digging "old ox trough-style" (rectangular, narrow at the bottom) wells were less prone to collapse. This solved the difficulty of thinking that wells could not be dug in sandy soil, and everyone began to dig.

(6) Seize the practical needs of women to mobilize their men to dig wells. Generally, women are very willing to have clothes to wear, thread to use, and cotton to use easily. Seizing their practical needs, they put forward the slogan of "Living without cloth to make clothes will not work," "Planting cotton will have clothes to wear and will not suffer," and educated many women to persuade their men to dig wells to overcome the famine.

As of April 20, incomplete statistics from 672 villages in the twelve counties of the Jizhong Eighth District show that 59 brick wells have been dug, 182 brick wells have been repaired, 5,691 earthen wells have been dug, and 1,939 earthen wells are under construction. However, there are still a considerable number of people who are watching. It is necessary to implement the mobilization and leadership of the masses so that the crash well-digging planting campaign becomes a conscious mass movement to ensure that the planting task is completed on time.

　　冀中八分区
  　怎样动员群众挖井防旱
    记者  超祺
    播种季节已到。冀中八分区仍未下雨。要完成今年农业增产计划、动员群众设法防旱挖井点种，成为目前农村工作最主要的一个环节。但因过去各地大都缺乏挖井习惯，村干部和群众普遍地存在着靠天思想。对挖井多抱消极态度，强调土质不宜；或说挖井费劲大，作用小等。冀中八分区各县通过下述动员方法解决了这些思想问题。
    一　以支部为核心，党员团结带动群众。
    交河一区三里庄是个没打井习惯的村庄，区干部一提起挖井，村干部们都说挖个土井得用好大工程，也不准行。在讨论中便反复解释，说明今后党员的基本任务就是领导群众生产，现在天旱种不上怎么办？这样慢慢的诱导到只有挖井点种才能解决问题，同时也认识到挖井的好处。搞通了思想。如党员干部郭绍先就首先组织了四个人，两天打成一个土井　他就宣传说：“打个土井并不费什么劲。四个人两天即能打成”。在他宣传带动下，又组织了十二个人，分成三组打了三个土井，这样就带动了全村群众起来突出挖井。
    二　深入调查，打破顾虑
    （一）以积极群众教育群众，经过宣传教育后，就必须抓住群众中的积极骨干分子，带动落后的。交河任老村，区干部一提出打井，有的群众就说：“净硷水，不能浇地。”当时有的群众解释说：“一亩三泉，水不一样”，“即使打出个硷水，地这样干，点种上也坏不了地”，区干部马上支持这正确的见解。这样打破了群众固执于水不好不能浇地而不愿挖井的思想。
    （二）以群众已有的经验去教育群众。交河段庄村利用了打井有经验的老农张墨龙向群众宣传解释说：“我年年打井，这个活并不难，天旱了就浇，我的庄稼那年比别人的不强啊？”这样使群众了解挖个土井并不难，而且好处很大，全村群众便动员起来，现在已打成了二十五眼。
    （三）以具体事实去教育群众。交河尹店村，用了程景章种早熟作物而渡过了春荒的实例，教育大家，那时他种了几畦豆角，十几沟瓜，点种了二分快棒子，一春只用了一口袋谷子，两口袋糠，掺上种的瓜菜就接下了粮食，全家渡过了春荒。他自己说：“我那年也离不了种瓜菜和快棒子，今年我还多种。”这样群众想通了，就自愿打井现已完成了十二个。
    （四）以群众靠天受害的痛苦教训教育群众。交河任老鸦村召集群众开会时问：“生活如何？”“粮食不够吃，是那来的害”。“过去灾荒年为啥挨饿受罪”等。并介绍了西部（安国一带）地区用水浇地，不下雨同样能收成。这样联系了群众目前的切身利益，打破了群众靠天吃饭的思想，提高了打井的信心。现已打成了八眼。
    （五）及时解决群众困难，加强领导组织打井。任何陈屯村（共一七○户）在动员挖井时，群众中就有“一人不能打井，雇人又没钱招待”的顾虑。领导上抓住这一机会组织群众合伙互助。现该村已组织了三十四户，四天内打成土井十三眼。任河交香与河间的一部份村庄，群众认为沙地打土井落不住。后与村干部等共同研究出挖“老牛槽式”（长方形，下面窄）的井不易塌。这样解决了认为沙土不能挖井的困难，就都开始打起来。
    （六）抓住妇女切身要求，发动其男人打井。一般妇女很愿穿衣使线用棉方便。抓住她们这个切身要求，提出“过日子没有布做衣裳不行”，“种棉有衣穿不遭难”的口号，教育了不少妇女劝男人挖井渡荒。
    截至四月二十日止，冀中八分区十二个县六百七十二个村不完全的统计，共打好砖井五九眼，修好砖井一八二眼，打好土井五六九一眼，正在打的土井一九三九眼。但在观望的群众为数也还不少。必须贯彻动员与领导群众，使突击挖井点种成为自觉的群众运动，才能保证按时完成播种的任务。
