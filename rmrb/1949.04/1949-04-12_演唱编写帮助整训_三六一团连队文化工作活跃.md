【Dongye Branch News】 The 361st Regiment of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army, in coordination with political consolidation and training, has widely launched mass cultural and recreational activities in the companies. A large number of grievance poems, clapper talk, short articles, cartoons, etc. have appeared on the company bulletin boards. The comrades of the editorial team are working day and night, and the soldiers with higher cultural levels in each platoon have also been invited to participate in the editorial work. Reading groups are also organized to explain the content of each issue of the bulletin board to the crowded readers in turn. The bulletin board in front of the Fourth Company is often too crowded, so First Platoon Leader Liu Weigan mobilized everyone in the platoon to publish a small bulletin board. New songs such as "Fight to the End" and "Victorious Advance" quickly became popular. Lectures and discussions are often held in the club. Short plays written and performed by the soldiers themselves have also played a great role in learning. The short play "Who Supports Whom" performed by the Ninth Company made Huang Tingyue, a soldier of the Fourth Company who couldn't find the root of his suffering, suddenly realize that his past suffering and poverty were all due to the exploitation of landlords. He also adapted his past suffering into the opera "Huang Tingyue's Detailed Account," which he performed himself, giving all the soldiers in the regiment a profound education. The Seventh Company collectively created short plays such as "Beat the Yellow Wolf" and "Fight to the End" in coordination with current affairs education, which also achieved good results. In one month, the regiment held a total of seven performances, two singing and speech contests, and convened a meeting to review the work of the club, in order to study how to further improve cultural and recreational work.

  　三六一团连队文化工作活跃
    【东野分社讯】人民解放军第四野战军某部三六一团配合政治整训，在连队中广泛展开群众性的文化娱乐活动。各连墙报上出现了大量的诉苦诗、快板、短文、漫画等，编辑组的同志日夜忙不开，各排文化较高的战士，也被请去参加编辑工作。并组织读报组，给拥挤不堪的读者轮流讲解每期墙报的内容。四连墙报前经常挤不开，一排长刘维干便在排内发动大家出版小型墙报。“打到底”、“胜利前进”等新歌曲，很快就流行开来。俱乐部里经常有着讲演和讨论会。战士们自编自演的短剧，在学习中也起了很大作用。九连演出的短剧“谁养活谁”，使找不到苦根的四连战士黄廷月恍然大悟，了解到过去吃苦受穷，都是地主剥削的缘故。他并把自己过去的苦难编成“黄廷月算细帐”歌剧，亲身演出，给全团战士以深刻的教育。七连配合时事教育集体创作了“打黄狼”、“打到底”等短剧，同样收到很好的效果。在一个月中，该团共计举行了七次演出，两次歌咏、演讲竞赛，并召开了一次评论俱乐部工作会议，以研究进一步提高文娱工作。
