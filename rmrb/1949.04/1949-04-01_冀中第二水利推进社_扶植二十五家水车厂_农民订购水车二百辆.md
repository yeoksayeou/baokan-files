　　Jizhong Second Water Conservancy Promotion Society
     Supports 25 Waterwheel Factories
     Farmers Order 200 Waterwheels
    [Jizhong News] The Jizhong Second Water Conservancy Promotion Society is actively promoting water conservancy construction. Last winter, the society began supporting 25 waterwheel manufacturing factories of various sizes in Anguo, Dingxian, and Shenze counties. As of the fifteenth day of the first month of the lunar calendar this spring, it had lent out 2,146,280 yuan (People's Currency) to support farmers in ordering 110 large waterwheels, 102 small waterwheels, 1,215 iron buckets, and 540 wooden buckets. With the support of the Promotion Society, the 25 waterwheel factories have overcome the slack season and developed their business. To promote the increase and improvement of the quality and quantity of waterwheels, on the fifth day of the first month of this year, the head of the Promotion Society's business section went to Shenze and Dingxian counties to help 15 waterwheel factories prepare production plans. The 15 factories plan to manufacture 815 large and small waterwheels in ten months, an increase of 57 percent over last year's output. At the same time, the Promotion Society sent nine cadres to Boye, Lixian, Suning, and the banks of the Tang River and Sha River, south of Ding'an Road, to go deep into the waterwheel factories to inspect output and quality, and to help research improvements. In addition, a meeting of well-digging teams was held. After the meeting, well-digging teams in various places have taken on work and started construction.
