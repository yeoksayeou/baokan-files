　　△ Workers at the Changxindian Locomotive Depot who were overhauling boilers used to arrive late and leave early under Kuomintang rule, just loafing around. Once, when repairing locomotive No. PF1436, replacing sixty screw stays and two arch bricks, it took Hou Guangshan and four others more than a month. After liberation, they recently repaired locomotive No. PF1433, replacing thirty screw stays and two arch bricks, and also worked on the smoke chamber and firebox, but it only took them eight days, and they saved a lot of materials.

　　△ On the afternoon of the 6th of this month, Li Guifang, an operations worker at the Shijingshan Power Plant, saw a bird's nest on the 77KV transmission line tower. The tower was fifty meters high, but he feared the bird's nest would cause a power outage, so he climbed up and removed it. Because he sees the entire job as his own responsibility.

　　△ Late at night on the 7th, Shu Zhanrong, an operations worker at the Shijingshan Power Plant, was still going from the radio station to inspect the new plant. When he walked to the bottom of a pulverized coal building, he discovered that a screw on the power knife switch of the coal conveyor was burning red like a small light, which could be dangerous. He immediately notified the duty engineer at the radio station and the boiler foreman, who immediately stopped the coal conveyor and connected another circuit for it to use power. Workers patrol everywhere late at night, looking for problems, a situation that never existed in the past.

　　今昔工人大不同
    △长辛店机务段装修锅炉的工友，在过去国民党统治时期，每天上工迟到早退，溜达溜达。有一次修理一个ＰＦ１４３６号的机车，换了螺掌六十根，拱砖管两根，由侯广山等五人负责修理，费时一个多月。解放后，最近他们又修理一个ＰＦ１４３３号机车，换了三十根螺掌，拱砖两根，还经过烟室，火室等工程，却只用了八天的时间，而且节省了许多材料。
    △本月六日下午石景山发电厂的运行工人李贵芳见７７Ｋ∧输电线铁塔上搭有一雀巢。该铁塔高五十米，但他怕因雀巢而有停电危险，随自动爬上去把鸟巢拉掉。因为他把整个工作都看成自己的事。
    △七号深夜了，石景山发电厂运行工人舒占荣还在由电台向新厂去观看。走到某粉炉楼下时，发现运煤器用电刀闸上一螺丝烧红如小灯，可能发生危险，他马上用电话通知电台值班工程师与锅炉领班，即刻停止运煤器，再接一便路，以便运煤器用电。工人在深夜到处巡视，找寻毛病，这情形也是过去没有的。
