Shijingshan Power Plant Repair Division Workers

Complete Four-Tenths of Half-Year Plan in Two Months

[This newspaper's dispatch] The Shijingshan Power Plant Repair Division of the North Hebei Electric Power Company ensures power generation and increased production with intensive work. In less than two months since March 1st, they have completed 40% of the half-year production plan. This production plan was made to prepare parts and add equipment in advance to consolidate power generation, and does not include temporary repair work. These temporary repair and fitting works average more than 250 kinds per month (each kind ranging from one to hundreds of pieces); however, all 60 employees, having become aware and improved their work efficiency after studying since liberation, still exceed the original production plan in addition to dealing with temporary tasks that arrive at any time. For example, the sprinkler pump work in the plan was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of April, but it was completed in mid-April, half a month ahead of schedule. The impellers for the No. 14 and 15 boiler fans in the plan were to be completed by mid-June, but were completed by the workers on March 18th after making time for a concentrated effort. In the past, the foundry department only opened the furnace once every two weeks, melting 1.5 tons of iron each time, but now they have to open the furnace every five or six days, and melt more than three tons of iron each time... Now the employees of the repair department are carrying out a production competition movement under the five major principles of unity, learning, practicality, speed, and saving. In the forging department, Yan Degui and Zhang Kuibin produced 100 round-headed screws in one day during the competition. Zhang Kuibin's palms were swollen from the work, but he said it didn't matter. Lathe workers Deng Wenhua and Li Shuguang initiated a personal competition on the 20th. Zheng Wenhua won by finishing the threads of 250 screws in two and a half days. Zheng Wenhua was originally a famous "loafer" (dawdler) in the repair division. In the past, he could only turn two ball bearings a day, and would also damage the lathe. After studying and reflecting after liberation, he changed his attitude towards labor. After this personal competition is over, they will hold a meeting to review the reasons for their success and failure so that both of them can gain experience and improve work efficiency.

　　石景山发电厂修理股职工
  　两月完成半年计划十分之四
    【本报讯】冀北电力公司石景山发电厂修理股全体职工以紧张的工作保证发电与增加生产。三月一日以来不到两个月，已完成半年生产计划的百分之四十。该项生产计划，是为巩固发电预先准备机件、增添设备而做的，并不包括临时修理工作。这些临时修配工作，平均每月仅种类就有二百五十多种（每种一件到数百件不等）；但全体职工六十人因在解放后经过学习，有了觉悟，提高了工作效率，除应付随时到来的临时工作外，仍超出原来的生产计划。如计划中的喷水器水泵工作，原计划四月底完成，但四月中即已完工、提前了半个月。计划中的十四、十五号锅炉吸风机叶子是要到六月中完成的、可是经过工友们抽空突击、三月十八日就做完了。铸工部过去要两星期才开一次炉，每回化铁一吨半，现在五六天就要开一次炉，而且每回要化三吨多铁……。现在修理部的职工们正在团结、学习、确实、迅速、节省五大原则下开展生产竞赛运动。锻工部阎德贵、张魁斌两人在竞赛中，一天打出了圆帽螺丝一百个。张魁斌打得手心都发肿了还说没关系。镟工邓文华、李树广两人二十日发起了个人竞赛，郑文华在两天半内把二百五十个螺丝的螺纹全部镟好获胜。郑文华原来是修理股有名的“泡将”（磨洋工），过去他每天只能镟两个滚珠，还要弄坏镟床，解放后经过学习与检讨，转变了劳动态度。待这次个人竞赛结束后，他俩将要开一个会检讨两人的成败原因，以便两人都能获得经验，提高工作效率。　　　　　　（炽）
