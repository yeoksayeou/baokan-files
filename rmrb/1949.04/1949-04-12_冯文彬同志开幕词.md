Comrades, honored guests, and fellow representatives:

    The First National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has victoriously opened today in the ancient capital of Beiping. This is a major event of great historical significance in the history of the Chinese youth movement. For nearly a century, especially since the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese youth have established their own revolutionary organization for the first time in 1920: the predecessor of the Communist Youth League – the Socialist Youth League, which went through the Communist Youth League of the Great Revolution and the Land Revolution era, the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard during the "December 9th" Movement and the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War, the Youth National Salvation United Association, Youth National Salvation Corps, the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard during the Anti-Japanese War, and the Democratic Youth League and the New Democratic Youth Alliance in the Kuomintang-controlled areas during the later period of the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, as well as the Democratic Youth League and other organizations in the liberated areas. In the great New Democratic revolutionary movement, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they have carried out heroic struggles and played a role in promoting the revolution forward. In the struggle, the Chinese youth’s political awareness has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and their revolutionary enthusiasm has grown. The vast number of progressive youth activists universally demanded the establishment of their own organization. In response to the demands of the broad masses of young people, and in order to further unite and educate the vast number of young people and to give greater play to the role of young people in the struggle and construction of the New Democratic revolutionary cause, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided in October 1946 to begin the pilot establishment of the Youth League.

    Since its trial establishment in 1946, the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has gradually developed into a powerful force of nearly 200,000 members nationwide. This is the result of the education and cultivation of Chinese youth by the Chinese Communist Party. Today, the Chinese revolution is about to achieve a nationwide victory. The tasks facing the Chinese youth are not only to continue to work hard to win the final victory of the revolution nationwide, but also to participate in the construction of a new democratic China. The convocation of the First National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League is of extremely great significance for further developing the youth movement and educating and uniting the entire generation of young people in the new China in the future.

    Among the representatives of this conference, there are representatives from liberated areas such as the Northwest, Northeast, North China, East China, and the Central Plains, as well as representatives from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, including Taiwan and other overseas regions. There are representatives from factories, rural areas, government offices, schools, and the People's Liberation Army all over the country. There are youth representatives from all aspects of workers, peasants, students, revolutionary staff, and teachers, as well as representatives of the Hui and Mongolian nationalities and overseas Chinese youth. There are labor heroes, model workers, and representatives of combat heroes who have made great contributions on the battlefield. In particular, there are also representatives of youth work from various periods of the Chinese youth movement, such as the Great Revolution period, the Land Revolutionary War period, the Anti-Japanese War period, and the People's Liberation War period. This conference is a gathering of youth workers from all over the country, and it is also a summary of the experiences of the Chinese youth movement over the past 30 years. It is an unprecedented victorious gathering in the history of the youth movement. The reason why we have such a victorious and great gathering today is the result of the struggle and sacrifice of the broad masses of the Chinese people and countless revolutionary youths. We will always remember them, inherit and carry forward their spirit, and express our deep condolences to them. We clearly recognize that this is particularly due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people's leader – Chairman Mao, and the great victory of the People's Liberation Army. We pay the most sublime respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.

    At this conference, we will summarize the experiences and lessons of the Chinese youth movement, determine the current guiding principles and tasks of the Chinese youth movement, adopt the charter of the New Democratic Youth League, formulate the work program of the League, and elect the unified leadership organization of the entire League – the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will inherit the glorious traditions of the past youth movement, actively participate in the construction work of all aspects of the New Democracy, and promote the completion of the New Democratic revolutionary cause. We believe that the conference will surely victoriously complete this task.

    Finally, on behalf of the conference, I would like to thank the international friends from afar who have come to attend the conference – the Korean youth delegation.

    中国新民主主义青年团，从一九四六年开始试建以来，已逐渐发展成为全国规模的近二十万团员的一支强大的队伍。这是中国青年在中国共产党的教育和培养下的成果。今天，中国革命即将取得全国胜利，摆在中国青年面前的任务是：不仅要继续努力，争取革命在全国底胜利，还要参加新民主主义新中国的建设，新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会的召开，对于今后进一步开展青年运动，教育团结新中国青年的整个一代，是有极重大的意义的。

    这次大会，我们将要总结中国青年运动的经验教训，确定中国青年运动当前的方针与任务，要通过新民主主义青年团的团章，制订团的工作纲领，选举出团的全团统一的领导机构——中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会。在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们将继承以往青年运动的光荣传统，积极参加新民主主义各方面的建设工作，推动新民主主义革命事业的完成，我们相信大会一定会胜利的完成这一任务的。
    最后，我代表大会，向远道来出席大会的国际朋友——朝鲜青年代表团致谢。
