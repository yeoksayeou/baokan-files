Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, April 28th:
He, entrusted by the millions of people of Jiangnan, embraced reeds in the darkness and crossed the Yangtze River, pleading for the People's Liberation Army to advance quickly!

One night before the Central Route People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, a PLA scout guarding the riverbank discovered a dark object floating on the misty river surface, gradually approaching the shore. The scout ran forward and saw it was a bundle of reeds, and someone was clinging tightly to it. The scout used his strength to pull the person out of the water. He was naked, wearing only a pair of shorts, shivering from the cold. As soon as he was ashore, he said intermittently, "Are you a comrade of the People's Liberation Army?" When the scout replied that he was indeed from the People's Liberation Army, this person immediately grabbed his hand, took a deep breath and said, "Found you!"

He took out a small finger-thick bottle from his mouth, removed the wax tightly sealing the opening, and took out a tightly rolled piece of paper. The paper was densely filled with words and drawings; only a magnifying glass could make it clear that it was a letter from the people of Jiangnan requesting the People's Liberation Army to quickly cross the Yangtze River, and a map of the south bank of the Yangtze River. This warrior who floated from the river was a Jiangnan people's guerrilla fighter. He was entrusted by the millions of people of Jiangnan to carry the letter and map across the river to find the People's Liberation Army. When he arrived at the riverbank, the Kuomintang bandit army had set up layers of sentry posts on the south bank, so he sneaked to the riverbank under the cover of darkness. But the river surface had already been blockaded. Where could he find boats on the vast river? The entrustment of the millions of people of Jiangnan made him forget about life and death. He put the small bottle in his mouth, picked up a bundle of reeds, and plunged into the great river. The wind was strong and the waves were high in the heart of the river, and the reeds kept spinning in the rolling torrents. The waves often submerged him, and the cold river water froze him stiff. But the fervent hopes of the people of Jiangnan supported him. He floated from six o'clock in the evening until three o'clock in the morning, fighting the gale and waves for a full nine hours. Finally, he reached the north bank and completed his mission.

The heroic deeds of this brave guerrilla fighter moved every officer and soldier of the People's Liberation Army. They tightly surrounded him, lit a fire to warm him, took off their clothes to put on him, and listened excitedly to his stories of the people of Jiangnan's expectations and the arduous struggle of the Jiangnan guerrillas. The arrival of this guerrilla fighter completely connected the hearts of the People's Liberation Army gathered on the north bank of the Yangtze River with the people on the south bank.

　　江南人民的使者
    白艾
    他受着江南千百万人民的嘱托，黑夜抱着芦苇飘过长江，请求解放军快些打过去！
    中路解放军渡江前的一个夜里，警戒江岸的一个解放军侦察员，发现薄雾溟蒙的江面漂着一个黑色的东西，渐渐靠近岸来。侦察员跑向前去一看，原来是一捆芦苇，上面却紧紧地爬着一个人。侦察员用力把这人从水里拉起来。他光着身子，只穿一条短裤，冻的只是发抖。他一上岸，就断断续续地说：“你是解放军同志吗？”当侦察员回答他正是解放军时，这人立即抓住他的手，深深地吐了口气说：“可找到了！”
    他从嘴里掏出一只手指粗的小瓶，揭去密密封着口的腊，取出一个搓得紧紧的小卷纸来。纸上密密细细地写满了字和画着图；只有用扩大镜才能看清楚，这是一封江南人民请求解放军迅速打过长江去的信，和一幅长江南岸的地图。这个从江上漂来的勇士是一个江南人民游击队员，他受着江南千万人民的托付，携带着信和地图过江来找解放军。当他到达江边时，国民党匪军在南岸布满了层层岗哨，他便乘着天黑溜到了江边。但江面早已封锁了，茫茫的江上那里去找船只？江南千百万人民的托付使他忘了生死，他把小瓶含到嘴里，抱起一捆芦苇，耸身跳下了大江。江心风紧浪大，芦苇在滚滚的急流里不住打转，浪花时时淹没了他，寒冷的江水把他冻得发僵。但是江南人民的热望支持着他。他从天黑六点钟一直漂到午夜三点钟，整整和狂风恶浪搏斗了九个钟头，终于他到达了北岸，完成了使命。
    这位勇敢的游击队员的英雄业迹，把解放军的每一个指战员都感动了。他们紧紧地围着他，给他生火取暖，把自己身上的衣服脱下来替他穿上，兴奋地听着他讲述江南人民的盼望和江南游击队艰苦斗争的故事。这位游击队员的到来，使云集长江北岸的解放军和南岸人民的心完全连在一起。
