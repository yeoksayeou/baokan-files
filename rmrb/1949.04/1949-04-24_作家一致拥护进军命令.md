　　Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De’s advance order of April 21st completely conforms to the demands and interests of the people. The Nanjing government's refusal to sign the domestic peace agreement indicates that the Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, effectively control the Nanjing government. Without overthrowing this reactionary group, there can be no peace or democracy in China. Today's news reports the successful crossing of the Yangtze River by the People's Liberation Army, meaning the people of southern China will finally see the light of day. Imagining the joyous and excited emotions of the elders and brothers in the South, words cannot express it.

　　Zhou Jianren
    Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order of the 21st to the entire army, to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the enemy, will surely bring joy and excitement to all the Chinese people. Since betraying the revolution, the Kuomintang reactionaries, led by the bandit Chiang, have committed countless crimes and slaughtered countless people! The number of youths they cruelly murdered is no less than several hundred thousand! I still remember that after Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, he slaughtered a large number of workers on Baoshan Road in Shanghai. Slogans such as "Implement the Premier's policy of agriculture and industry" were printed on the telephone poles, but below the poles, the road was filled with the blood of workers; those who were injured but not dead were nailed into white coffins and transported away to cover up the traces. Chiang Kai-shek is a great enemy of mankind, and this is just one of his countless crimes. After he and his cronies became slaves of American imperialism, they even allowed American imperialists to station troops in some places, sold the national sovereignty that should belong to the people, and plundered the people's property to the tune of hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars, and so on, doing countless things that harmed the interests of the nation and the people. However, the deeply sinful bandit Chiang Kai-shek and his die-hard followers have never shown any remorse. This time, they even ordered the Nanjing Kuomintang government to reject the eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the peace agreement for negotiations, attempting to resist the people to the end. However, the unparalleled strength of the People's Liberation Army has been proven by repeated great victories; the last four articles of the order are precisely the long-held wishes of the people. Therefore, this just war of liberation will surely be wholeheartedly supported and warmly welcomed by the people of the whole country. The liberation of the whole country is not far away. Every Chinese person will surely be willing to redouble their efforts and bravely advance, disregarding their own hardships and sacrifices, in order to quickly achieve complete victory.

　　Hu Feng
    A peaceful resolution is for the sake of minimizing harm to the lives and well-being of the people, minimizing damage to the nation's wealth and vitality, and for the sake of relieving the suffering of the vast majority of the people, except for a very small number of reactionary ringleaders, as quickly as possible, so that their strength can be liberated and effectively stand on the front lines of creating a bright future for the nation. If this purpose is violated, and the reactionaries still vainly attempt to preserve their strength, then the so-called peace becomes a crime against history.
    If the enemy—the enemy of the people, the enemy of the nation—does not lay down the butcher knife, then scatter him, crush him, eliminate him!
    This is the final war. Under this solemn order, the people in the liberated areas will surely dance and advance in their respective posts, and the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas will surely rise up and respond in various ways.

　　Ye Shengtao　Song Yunbin
    The Nanjing Kuomintang government's rejection of the generous and reasonable domestic peace agreement is a determination to be an enemy of the people. We can only rely on the great strength of the People's Liberation Army to quickly eliminate all enemies of the people, so that all of China can be liberated as soon as possible.

　　Shi Dongshan
    The content of this domestic peace agreement can be said to be the crystallization of the excellent traditions of Chinese national culture and Marxist-Leninist theory. It is not only correct, but also expresses benevolence and generosity. All Chinese people should approve of it, but the Nanjing government is unwilling to sign this agreement. This clearly shows that the Nanjing government cannot get rid of the manipulation of Chiang Kai-shek behind the scenes, and is still using the suffering of the people as capital to play its tricks, thus becoming a historical sinner of the Chinese nation. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army's combat crossing of the Yangtze River to completely eliminate their fascist rule and liberate the people of southern China from their predicament is a completely correct and necessary action.

　　Zang Kejia
    The Nanjing reactionary government repeatedly calls for "peace," but when the extremely generous peace conditions were specified, they were rejected. Chiang Kai-shek and the Nanjing reactionary regime simply want to use peace as a smokescreen to preserve their remaining forces, so as to take the opportunity to rise again. Like a wounded beast, if you don't stick a knife into its heart, it will still struggle to counterattack.
    Any deceptive trick cannot deceive the eyes of the people, and the people have enough strength to eliminate this reactionary remnant. Seeing Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order to the People's Liberation Army, it is like hearing the sound of a majestic drum, making people excited and inspired, and generating a feeling of courageous engagement with the enemy.
    For the ever-victorious million-strong army, the Yangtze River is no longer a natural barrier. The will of the people can break through all obstacles and move forward! The compatriots in southern China who are in dire straits are waiting to respond and welcome their own troops; behind the People's Liberation Army stand hundreds of millions of people. The news of victory will soon come from the south bank of the Yangtze River, and the collapse of the reactionary regime is not far off. In this final annihilation battle, we must fully support the front lines and strive for the early arrival of complete victory!

　　He Jiahuai
    This time when I came to Beiping, I passed through several liberated areas. Among the armed comrades I met in various liberated areas, there was a universal mood, an eager, impatient mood, and an urgent desire to cross the Yangtze River; everyone said: "We are ready for everything and can cross the river at any time, just waiting for Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order."
    Similarly, among the cadres at all levels I saw along the way—especially the young cadres—there was also this universal mood. They were only afraid that Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu would not issue the order sooner, so they could not cross the river sooner. They all said in unison: "Our preparatory work can guarantee that the army can cross the river at any time and anywhere."
    The enthusiasm of the people in the liberated areas (whether in the new, old, or semi-old areas) to support the front lines is especially surprising and moving; the mountains of grain, the endless stream of transportation, and the vigorous movement to join the army are indeed unprecedented phenomena in history, with many moving stories. Among these people who have turned themselves over, there is only one wish, which is to send the People's Liberation Army across the Yangtze River as soon as possible. What they are looking forward to day and night is the order from Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.
    With such morale and such popular support, of course, it is invincible and unbeatable. Only war criminals like Chiang Kai-shek, who are mad with ambition, would vainly attempt to use the natural barrier of the Yangtze River to prevent the progress of the liberation movement and to preserve the anti-revolutionary bulwark.
    During the negotiations, everyone waited with the greatest tolerance for the final awakening of the Nanjing government, waiting for them to completely sever ties with the US imperialism and the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek, and sincerely surrender to the people. This kind of waiting and tolerance, in the eyes of people with high combat emotions, is rather a special kind of pain. But now, due to the Nanjing government's stubbornness and unwillingness to repent, due to their rejection of true peace, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's advance order has finally been issued, the waiting and tolerance have finally ended, and the great advance has finally begun. This sacred order, which realizes the will of the people of the whole country and has the unanimous support of all sectors, I deeply believe that longing for an early crossing of the Yangtze River, longing for the elimination of the reactionary remnants, longing for the capture of the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek and his confidant lackeys. In the thoroughly liberated commanders, fighters, cadres at all levels, and the broad masses of people of China, will cause immense excitement and gratitude, jubilation and inspiration, greatly enhance combat enthusiasm and combat spirit, making the crossing of the Yangtze River by millions of troops a matter of time, making the great victory in the national scope also a matter of time—I firmly believe that I will soon be able to participate in the epoch-making victory celebration in this ancient capital!

　　作家一致拥护进军命令
　　茅盾
    毛主席朱总司令四月二十一日的进军命令是完全符合人民的要求和利益的。南京政府拒绝签订国内和平协定，表示蒋介石为首的国民党反动集团事实上是控制了南京政府。这一个反动集团不打倒，中国就没有和平与民主可言。今日报载，解放大军渡江胜利成功，江南人民从此得见天日，遥想江南父老兄弟欢欣鼓舞的情绪，实非语言可以表达。
　　周建人
    毛主席朱总司令二十一日命令全军，坚决彻底干净全部歼灭敌人。全中国人民听了必定非常欢欣、兴奋。以蒋贼为头的国民党反动派自从背叛革命以来，不知作了多少罪恶，屠杀了多少人民！被他们虐杀的青年，不下数十万人！我还记得，蒋匪背叛革命后，便在上海宝山路上屠杀大批工人，电杆上印着“实行总理农工政策”的标语，电杆下面马路上却流满了工人的血；受伤不死的也被订在白皮棺材中运去以灭迹。蒋介石是人类的大仇敌，这不过是无数罪行中的一件。到他及其党羽做了美帝国主义的奴才以后，竟允许美帝国主义者在若干地方驻兵，盗卖应为人民所有的国家主权，劫掠人民财物达美金一二百万万等等，更不知做了多少危害民族利益及人民利益的事情。然而这罪恶深重的匪首蒋介石及其死党始终丝毫没有悔罪的心，此次竟又命令南京国民党政府拒绝和谈的八条二十四款和平协定，企图反抗人民到底。但人民解放军的力量之无比强大，已有累次的伟大胜利可作证明；命令中后面的四条，又正是人民心中蓄积已久的愿望。故这一正义的解放战争的进军，必为全国人民衷心拥护，与热烈欢迎。全国的解放已经不远，每个中国人民必然愿意加倍的奋勇前进，自己的吃苦与牺牲都所不计，以求迅速获得全面胜利。
　　胡风
    和平解决，是为了人民的身家生命少受损害，民族的财富元气少受破坏，是为了极少数的反动派头子以外的、广大的人民尽快地解除痛苦，使他们的力量解放出来，有效地站到创造民族的光明前途的岗位上面。如果违反了这个目的，在这以外，反动派还妄想保存他们的力量，那所谓和平，就成了对于历史的犯罪。
    敌人——人民的敌人、民族的敌人如果不放下屠刀，那就打散他，冲垮他，消灭他！
    这是最后的战争，在这个庄严的命令下面，解放区的人民一定各各在自己的岗位上欢舞，前进，国统区的人民一定在各种的方式下面，奋起、响应。
　　叶圣陶　宋云彬
    南京国民党政府拒绝宽大的、合理的国内和平协定，是决心与人民为敌。我们惟有依靠人民解放军的伟大力量，迅速消灭一切人民的敌人，使全中国早日得到解放。
　　史东山
    这次国内和平协定的条款内容可以说得是中华民族文化的优良传统和马列主义理论的结晶品，它不但正确，也表现了仁厚宽大，凡是中国人民应该没有不赞成的，但南京政府不愿意签这个协定。那显然是南京政府还不能摆脱它幕后人蒋介石的操纵，还在拿人民的痛苦作本钱来打它的鬼主意，从此做定了中国民族千古的罪人。因此，人民解放军战斗渡江以彻底消灭他们的法西斯统治，将江南人民在倒悬的情况中解放出来，这一行动是完全正确的、必要的。
　　臧克家
    南京反动政府口口声声要“和平”，到了极为宽大的和平条件具体了的时候，竟被他们拒绝了。蒋介石和南京反动政权，无非想借和平做烟幕，好保存残余势力，以便乘机再起。象一头受伤的野兽一样，不把刀子插到它的心脏里去，它还是想挣扎着向人反扑的。
    任何欺诈的把戏瞒不过人民的眼睛，人民有足够的力量消灭这反动的残余。看到毛主席朱总司令给各路解放军下的命令，就象听到了堂堂的鼓声，令人兴奋鼓舞，发生一种慷慨赴敌的感觉。
    对于战无不胜的百万雄师，长江已不成其为天堑了。人民的意志可以突破一切障碍而前进！江南倒悬的同胞在等待着响应，迎接自己的队伍；解放军背后站着亿万以上的人民。胜利的消息不久会从长江南岸传过来，反动政权的倾倒，已经为期不远了。在这最后的歼灭战中，我们要全力支援前线，争取全面胜利的早日到来！
　　何家槐
    这次我到北平来，经过了好几个解放区。在各解放区所遇到的武装同志中，有着一种普遍的情绪，一种跃跃欲试，急不及待的情绪，一种迫切地要求过江的情绪；大家都说：“我们什么都已准备妥当了，随时都可以过江，只等待毛主席和朱总司令的命令。”
    同样地，在我沿途所见到的各级干部—尤其是青年干部中，也普遍地存在着这一种情绪，他们只怕毛主席和朱总司令不早点颁布命令，不能够早日过江。他们都众口同声的说：“我们的准备工作，已可能保证大军随时过江，随地过江。”
    各解放区老百姓（不论是新区老区或半老区）的支前热情，尤其使人惊异，使人感动；那堆积如山的粮食，那络绎不绝的运输，那如火如荼的参军运动，的确是历史上空前的现象，其中不少可歌可泣的故事。在这些翻了身的人民中，也只有一个唯一的愿望，就是把解放军早点送过江去，他们所日日夜夜盼望的，也就是毛主席和朱总司令的命令。
    以这样的士气，以这样的民气，当然是无坚不摧，无战不胜的。只有象蒋介石那样丧心病狂的战犯，才会妄想以长江的天险来阻止解放运动的进展，来保全反革命的壁垒。
    在谈判期间，大家都曾以最大的容忍，等待着南京政府的最后觉悟，等待着他们能和美帝以及匪首蒋介石完全割断关系，而真诚地投降于人民。这种等待和容忍，在战斗情绪正高的人们看来，毋宁是一种特别的痛苦。可是，现在，由于南京政府的怙恶不悛，执迷不悟，由于他们拒绝真正的和平，毛主席和朱总司令的进军命令终于发布了，等待和容忍终于结束了，伟大的进军也终于开始了。这一道实现了全国人民意志，得到各阶层一致拥护的神圣命令，我深信在渴望着早日渡江，渴望着消灭反动的残余势力，渴望着活捉匪首蒋介石及其心腹走狗。在彻底解放全中国的指战员、各级干部、和广大的人民中，将引起巨大无比的兴奋和感激，欢腾和鼓舞，大大的提高了战斗热情和战斗精神，使百万大军过江变成旦夕间的事情，使全国范围内的伟大胜利，也变成旦夕间的事情——我深信不久就可以在这文化古都，参加划时代的祝捷大会！
