　　Letters to the Editor
    To the Editor:
    The North Ping [Beiping] dispatch entitled "Shijiazhuang Public Winery Illegally Purchases Grain and Sells Wine, Case Referred to North China People's Government for Handling" published on page one of the March 17th People's Daily is a misunderstanding of the previous instructions from the Central Hebei District to our department. We checked and found that our department had previously telegraphed to various locations stating that public-owned stores and organizations under the North China Bureau are not permitted to set up purchasing stands in neighboring districts; those that have already set up stands must withdraw within a specified period. Furthermore, a dispatch has been written and sent to your newspaper for publication. The so-called neighboring districts refer to neighboring districts outside of the North China region (referring to neighboring districts such as East China and Northeast China). Shijiazhuang and Baoding are both within the scope of the North China region and cannot be interpreted as neighboring districts. In addition to notifying Central Hebei to make corrections, please make further corrections.
    　　　　Industrial and Commercial Department of the North China People's Government
    Additionally: In General Lin Biao's speech on page one of the 31st, "If the enemy is willing to surrender, we will accept," should read, "If the enemy is willing to accept Chairman Mao's eight peace terms, we will agree."

    编辑同志：
    三月十七日人民日报第一版登载“石家庄公营酿酒厂竟违法购粮销酒，已请华北人民政府处理”为题的北平通讯，系冀中对本部前所指示之误解，查本部前曾电告各地，华北局之公营商店机关生产，不许在友邻区设掷采购，已设摊者，限期撤回。且已写成通讯送贵报公布。所谓友邻区系指华北区以外的友邻区而言（指如华东、东北等友邻区）。石家庄与保定均在华北区范围以内，不能作友邻区解释。除通知冀中纠正外，请加更正。

    又：三十一日本报一版林彪将军讲话中“如果敌人愿意投降，我们接受”。应为“如果敌人愿意接受毛主席八项和平条件，我们答应”。
