　　Taiyuan Workers See Their Own Troops
　　Guo Xi

　　At 1:30 PM on the 20th, the People's Liberation Army occupied the "Northwest Steel Plant" in Gucheng Village, eight miles north of Taiyuan City. Here, the Taiyuan workers who had been brutally ruled by the Yan Faction for more than ten years met their own class troops for the first time. When the rapidly advancing People's Liberation Army attacked the factory from the north, east, and west, the Yan Faction troops, entrenched in this second line of defense, one of the six major strongholds of the so-called "Iron Capital," fled south in panic; however, the workers of the factory ran towards the PLA, in the opposite direction. The workers' eyes sparkled with tears of mingled sorrow and joy. A young worker grabbed the reporter's hand and said, "As soon as we heard the cannons to the north at twelve o'clock last night, we were happy, knowing that the hard days were finally over!" Another worker excitedly said, "As soon as I saw the troops coming up, I knew it must be you, because I saw the leather hats you were wearing." Then, several workers led us to search for the remaining bandits in various places. Some workers used wooden boards to carry the wounded soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to the factory's medical station, while worker Wu Qingliang and others had already taken tools to repair the power lines that had been broken by the artillery fire. They said, "Except for a few broken high-voltage lines, all the machines are in good condition, and we can continue working tonight." Many soldiers and the workers squatting around them also began to talk, forgetting their fatigue. The workers in the transportation section brought a pot of boiling water and poured it for the soldiers to drink. They watched the soldiers take out hard, dry biscuits from their pockets and gnaw on them, saying, "You are really too tired!" The soldiers replied without hesitation, "It's nothing to suffer a little for the liberation of our class brothers." Worker Xing Lizhi whispered to a soldier: "Wait, I still have some rice stored at my place, I'll cook some porridge for you," The soldier grabbed his hand and said, "Don't! Don't! Leave that rice for yourself, you are having a hard time." Xing Lizhi replied with a smile, "We won't be in trouble anymore!" But the soldiers didn't let him go after all.

　　太原工人看见了自己的队伍
    郭锡
    二十日下午一时半，人民解放军占领了太原城北八里古城村的“西北炼钢厂”，在这里被阎匪残暴统治了十多年的太原工人们，第一次会见了他们自己的阶级队伍。当神速进展着的人民解放军从北、东、西三面攻击该厂时，据守在这座号称所谓“铁都”的第二道防线六大据点之一的阎匪军，竟仓惶弃碉南窜了；但是和他们走着相反的方向，该厂工人们，却迎着解放军跑来了。工人们眼内闪烁着一种悲喜交加的泪光，一个年青的工人抓住记者的手说：“昨天晚十二点一听见北边炮响，我们就高兴啦，知道苦日子可熬出来了”另一个工人兴奋地说：“刚才一见队伍上来，我就说准是你们来了，因为我看见你们戴的皮帽子了。”接着几个工人就领着我们分头到各处去搜索残匪。另一些工人用木板把解放军的伤员抬送到工厂的医疗所去，而工人吴庆良等则已经拿上工具去修理被炮打断的电线去了，他们说：“除去断了几条高压线外，全部机器全好好的，晚上就能继续工作。”许多战士和蹲在他们周围的工人们也谈起来，都忘记了疲倦。运输段的工人们提来一壶开水倒给战士们喝，他们看着战士们从口袋里倒出干硬的饼子一口口啃着，都说：“你们真太辛苦了！”战士们则毫不介意的回答：“为了解放阶级弟兄，苦点没什么。”工人邢立志低声嘱咐战士：“你们等着，我那里还存着点大米，给你们熬点粥喝，”这个战士一手把他拉住说：“可别！可别！那点米你留下吃吧，你们的日子挺苦的。”邢立志笑着回答：“咱们以后可就不苦了呢！”但是战士们到底没让他去。
