　　Yangquan Publicly-Operated Baoxingheng Store
  　Examining Departmentalism
  　Avoiding Encouraging Private Merchant Speculation
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Yangquan Publicly-Operated Baoxingheng Coal and Iron Main Store recently convened a meeting of cadres at the section chief level and above to examine the departmentalism prevalent in various departments, and criticized the bureaucratic work style of the leadership. In business operations, there was a failure to consider the overall situation, focusing solely on the profits of their own departments, giving private merchants opportunities for speculation. Last December, when cloth prices in Yangquan rose, the publicly-operated Anyang store proposed exchanging 20,000 bolts of cloth for millet to stabilize prices, but Baoxingheng, for the sake of its own department, held onto 50,000 bolts of cloth (some of which was intended for the supply and marketing cooperative) and refused to exchange them. At the same time, the main store and branch stores, and the branch stores themselves, each managed their own affairs, with each concerned about their own profits. For example, the Xinglong branch store sent spikes to the main store, but the price was not right at the time. It was only when the price of rice rose that it became profitable. Secondly, in controlling the price of iron goods, last November, they simply followed the blind price increases of private merchants, leading to large fluctuations in iron goods prices. At that time, the Zhengtai Coal and Iron Company instructed them to stop lending, but this was not seriously implemented, and they did not contact the local Party and government organs, with the result that both producers and consumers were affected. In addition, there was no concrete understanding of sales conditions. Sometimes, the goods that sold well were not sufficiently controlled, while large quantities of slow-moving goods were stockpiled and could not be sold, causing the entire business to fluctuate. At the examination meeting, bureaucratic work styles were also examined. For example, the leadership of the main store had not planned and convened a single meeting of branch store managers in a year. After reading the reports of the branch stores, they rarely offered opinions or timely replies, and failed to play a better leadership role. It has now been decided to overcome these biases, continue to deepen the examination, strengthen the study of policies and theories, clearly establish an overall concept, and begin by strictly implementing the system of asking for instructions and reporting.

　　阳泉公营宝兴亨号
  　检查本位主义
  　避免助长私商投机
    【石家庄讯】阳泉公营宝兴亨煤铁总店于日前召开股长以上干部会议，检查各部门的本位主义思想，并批评了领导上的官僚主义作风。在经营业务上不照顾全面，单从自己部门营利出发，给予私商以投机钻空机会。去年腊月阳泉布价上涨，公营安阳商店提出以小米交换二万匹布平抑物价，宝兴亨为了自己部门打算，存着五万匹布（其中一部为供给供销社），不肯拿出交换。同时总店与分店，分店与分店之间都各管各的，你赚你的钱，我赚我的钱，如分店兴隆号给总店发道钉，当时不合价，等米价上涨时才合价。其次在掌握铁货价格上，去年十一月，只是跟上私商盲目的涨价，形成铁货大波动。那时正太煤铁公司指示停放，但没有认真执行，又没有和当地党政机关联系，结果使生产与消费者都受到影响。另外对销路情况没有具体了解，有时顺销货掌握不够，背销货大批积存，推销不出，使整个业务陷于波动。在检查会议上，并检查了官僚主义的作风，如在总店领导上，一年中从未有计划的召开过一次各分店经理会议，看了各分店的报告后，很少提出意见，及时答复，没有更好发挥领导作用。今后决定要克服这些偏向，继续深入检查，加强政策理论的学习，明确树立整体观念，并且首先从严格执行请示报告制度入手。
