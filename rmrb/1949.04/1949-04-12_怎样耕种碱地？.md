How to Cultivate Alkaline Land?
Wei Fengtu

I. Origins and Types of Alkaline Land

Alkaline land originates from several sources. Firstly, rivers containing saline water occasionally flow over the ground, causing salt to seep into the soil. Secondly, the soil itself may contain salt, but a lack of rainfall prevents it from dissolving and being washed away. Thirdly, the soil's original rocks and other minerals continuously weather and decompose into salts. Therefore, areas prone to flooding and near rivers are likely to become alkaline. It is common for people who extract saltpeter to find a never-ending supply. If there is a period of drought with no rain, the land often becomes white, even forming a hard crust on the surface.

The nature of alkali contained in alkaline land can be divided into two types: black and white. Black alkaline land mainly contains a type of soda, which can erode and decompose residual plant roots in the soil, turning the soil yellowish-black. This type of soil often has columnar crystalline alkali underneath. White alkaline land mainly contains salt, which is what is commonly referred to as saline soil and not alkaline soil. Most of the alkaline land in central Hebei belongs to the white alkaline soil type.

II. How Does Alkaline Land Harm Crops?

(1) To Seeds: Seeds need an adequate amount of moisture to germinate. However, the moisture in alkaline land contains alkalinity or salinity, which not only makes it difficult for seeds to absorb, but also draws moisture from the seeds into the soil. Seeds lacking moisture cannot germinate. (2) To Roots: The moisture in roots is less concentrated than the alkaline or saline moisture in alkaline land. Therefore, the roots' moisture is often absorbed into the soil, causing them to wither and die. At the same time, alkalinity has an erosive effect, injuring fine roots and stem bark. Consequently, plants in alkaline land cannot grow and slowly die.

III. How to Improve Alkaline Land

The basic key to improving alkaline land is to reduce the amount of dissolved alkali and salt in the soil. Given the current conditions, it is difficult to find effective ways to treat highly alkaline land. For weakly and moderately alkaline land, the following methods are generally available:

First, plant alkali-resistant plants, such as millet, sorghum, glutinous sorghum, sweet sorghum, broomcorn millet, barnyard grass, early rice, alfalfa, foxtail millet, Artemisia sacrorum Ledeb, sesame, hemp, cotton, sugar beets, Siberian wild pear, mulberry, etc. In severely alkaline land, broomcorn and ash trees can be planted. The alkali resistance of these plants varies, and seedlings have low alkali resistance. It is best to cultivate seedlings in good soil and transplant them to alkaline land.

Second, deep plowing can turn the salt concentrated on the surface layer to the bottom, reducing the salt content in the range where plant roots are distributed, allowing them to grow. After they grow, on the one hand, their resistance is strong, and on the other hand, the plants' branches and leaves cover the ground, which can reduce the evaporation of underground moisture, thereby reducing the chance of salt in the lower layer condensing on the surface.

Third, prevent the evaporation of underground moisture. Planting alkali-resistant small-leaved plants in alkaline land can use their dense branches and leaves to cover the ground and reduce the evaporation of underground moisture.

Fourth, remove soluble salts from alkaline soil: (1) Scrape off the surface alkaline soil, which can be used for leaching salt, alkali, and saltpeter. However, this method is not effective for land with excessively thick alkaline soil layers. (2) Plant alkali-resistant plants, such as Salicornia europaea and Suaeda salsa, which can absorb some alkali during their growth. (3) Flushing with sweet water can wash away some of the alkalinity, and some can seep down with the water. Therefore, it is advisable to dig artesian wells in weakly and moderately alkaline land, and utilizing floodwater for siltation in areas near rivers is a good method.

IV. Farmers' Experiences in Cultivating Alkaline Land

First, for large, uneven land, small ridges can be built separately to allow water to be stored when it rains. Use rainwater to dissolve and infiltrate the alkali salts. A small ditch can be left along the edge of the ridge, allowing excessive rainwater to flow into the ditch.

Second, reduce the area of the land. In areas with little rainfall and small area, the land can be leveled into one high and one low area. Abandon the high ground and only plant the low-lying area. After it rains, the water from the high ground will also concentrate in the low-lying area, increasing the amount of water, which can push the alkali down. This will not only allow seedlings to emerge, but also grow well.

Third, for land where seedlings are difficult to emerge, do not plow in the autumn. The purpose is to allow the alkali to condense on the surface. In the following spring, scrape off the topsoil and then carry out spring plowing and sowing. Some do not plow in the autumn, but wait for rain. Immediately plow and sow after heavy rain - rapid plowing and rapid sowing. This way, the seedlings will emerge before the alkali can turn up.

Fourth, soil replacement method: First put some good soil or sandy soil in the pit, then sow or plant seedlings. Even if the alkalinity comes up later, the plants have already grown. Spreading sandy soil in alkaline land also has a considerable effect.

Fifth, point watering method: Pour more water into the pits where seeds are sown or seedlings are planted to ensure that plants have enough water to absorb, and to dissolve and infiltrate some of the alkalinity in the soil, allowing the roots of the plants to develop temporarily without being injured.

Sixth, use more acidic fertilizers: Sheep manure (mixed with sandy soil), mule and horse manure, pen manure, wheat bran, vinegar bran, wine bran, etc., can all be used on alkaline land, because these things contain acidity, which can neutralize the alkalinity in the soil and reduce the alkalinity of the land.

　　怎样耕种碱地？
    魏凤图
  　　　　　一　碱地来源和种类
    一方面因常有盐质的河水从地面上经过以后，把盐质渗到土中；另方面土里原有些盐分，但因雨水少没有机会溶化在水里冲走；再就是土里原有的岩石等矿物质，不断风化分解成为盐类，故常发水及近河的地方，就好有碱性。常见淋盐淋硝的人老刮老有，如果有一个时期干燥无雨，就往往遍地皆白，甚至使地皮成一层硬壳。
    碱地所含碱的性质可分黑白两种，黑碱地主要含有一种食碱质，能把土中残存的植物细根等侵蚀腐烂，使土变成黄黑色，这种土下面常有些柱形的结晶碱。白碱地主要含有盐质，这就是常说的盐土，并不是碱土。冀中碱地大多属于白碱土之类。
    　　　　二　碱地对庄稼有什么害处
    （一）对种籽：种籽发芽时须有适量的水分，但碱地水分因有碱性或盐性，不但不易为种籽吸取，反把种籽原有的水分吸到土里去，种籽缺乏水分即不能发芽。（二）对根子：根子里原有的水分，不如碱地的碱性或盐性水分的浓度大，因此根的水分常被吸收到土中而枯死。同时碱性还有一种侵蚀性，使细根及茎皮受伤。因此，碱地植物不能生长慢慢死去。
    　　　　三　怎样改良碱地
    改良碱地的基本关键，在于如何减除土里所含的溶解性的碱和盐，按目前条件，对碱地尚难找出有效办法，对弱碱及中等碱性的土地，一般有以下几个办法：
    第一、种耐碱性的植物，如谷、高粱、黏高粱、甜秫秸、黍子、粕子、旱稻、苜蓿、禾子、香蒿、芝麻、大麻、棉花、甜萝＠、杜梨、桑等；在较重碱地里可栽种扫帚、白腊杆子树等。以上这些植物的抗碱力大小有所不同，幼苗抗碱力小，在好土养苗向碱地移栽最好。
    第二、深耕；能把凝在地表层的盐质翻在下面，使植物根子分布的范围里减少了盐分，就能生长。长大之后，一方面本身抵抗力强大，另方面植物的枝叶把地面遮掩可以减少地下水分之蒸发，下层的盐质也就减少了向表层凝结的机会。
    第三、防止地下水分之蒸发。在碱地种抗碱性的小叶植物，可借它稠密的枝叶把地遮住，减少地下水分蒸发。
    第四、除去碱土溶解性的盐质：（一）刮去浮面碱土，可用之淋盐淋碱淋硝。但碱土层过厚的地不易收效。（二）种耐碱性的植物，如盐蓬碱蓬等，在生长期间能吸收一部碱分。（三）用甜水冲浇，可把碱性冲走一部，同时还有一部可随水之渗透渗下去。因此弱碱与中碱地可提倡打洋井，在近河地区利用洪水放淤是好办法。
    　　　　四　农民种碱地的经验
    第一、大块不平的土地，可分别叠上小埝，使下了雨能存水，利用雨水，把碱盐溶化渗透下去。可在埝边沿留一小沟，雨水过大时还可把碱性水流入沟中。
    第二、缩小地的面积。在雨水少面积小的情况下，可把地整成一高一低，把高地放弃不种，专种洼地，下雨后使高处的水也集中在洼地来，这样水就大些，能把碱追下去，不但能拿苗，还能长得好。
    第三、不好拿苗的地，可以不秋耕，目的是使碱质能凝结在表面，到次年春天把表土刮去，再行春耕播种。有的不秋耕，专等下雨，大雨后立时耕立时耩，暴耕暴耩，这样等不到碱翻上来苗就出来了。
    第四、换土法：在坑里先放上一些好土或砂土，再下种或栽苗，即便以后碱性又翻上来，植物已经长大。碱地里撒布砂土，也有相当效果。
    第五、点水法：在点种或栽种的坑里多浇一些水，使植物有充分的水分吸收，更可把土中碱性溶解一部渗透下去，使植物的根暂时不受伤得到发展。
    第六、多使酸性肥料：凡羊粪尿（拌砂土），骡马粪、圈肥、麦糠、醋糠，酒糠等，都可以上碱地，因为这些东西都含有酸性，能和土中碱性中和，减削地的碱性。
