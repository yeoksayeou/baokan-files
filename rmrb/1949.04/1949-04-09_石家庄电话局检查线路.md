　　Shijiazhuang Telephone Bureau
  　Inspects Lines
    [Shijiazhuang News] The employees of the Shijiazhuang Telephone Bureau conducted a comprehensive inspection of telephone lines throughout the city, completing 955 machines in twenty-one days, nine days ahead of the original schedule. Most users reflected, "When the Kuomintang was here, if the telephone was broken, it would take three or four requests to get someone to come. Now, before the telephone is even broken, you are coming to inspect and repair it. This is truly something that has never happened before."

    【石家庄讯】石家庄电话局职工，进行全市电话线路大检查，二十一天完成了九百五十五个机器，较原计划提前了九天完成。大多数用户反映：“国民党在时电话坏了，叫三四次都请不来。现在电话还没有坏，你们倒找着来给检修，这真是从来没有过的事。”
