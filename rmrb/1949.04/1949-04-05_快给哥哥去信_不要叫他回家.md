Quickly Write a Letter to My Brother – Don't Tell Him to Come Home
    Wu Wancai
    My name is Wu Wancai, fifteen years old, from Baifu Village, Changshun County, Hebei. Before, my family had no house, no land, and no money, and there was no way to make a living. From the age of twelve, I herded pigs for others for two years. Then I went to Beijing to be an apprentice at a sieve shop. My mother helped neighbors with odd jobs at home, unable to save any money, and had to say nice things to the employers. If they didn't want her, there would be no food to eat. My mother would go outside the village and cry. I couldn't help but shed tears too. The suffering of my childhood is unspeakable. Now, the Eighth Route Army has liberated our village. I returned home from Beiping. The village cadres in my village really did many good things. They said my family was dirt poor, and they allocated land to me. I got a portion of a house, and more than a portion of movable property. This can be considered a good life. I went to primary school again. My mother had work to do and food to eat. On March 28th this year, my brother sent a letter; he was a soldier in the Kuomintang army. He joined our ranks after being liberated by the People's Liberation Army. But he wrote a letter asking my mother to send him plain clothes; I think he must be thinking of deserting and going home, which is not right, and it's important to not do that. Quickly write a letter to my brother, don't tell him to come home. Advise him to do well, being a People's Liberation Army soldier is glorious, and it is helping the people to stand up. All the working people will say it's good. I am farming at home, and the village cadres are very helpful. Our family is already living a very good life!

　　快给哥哥去信　不要叫他回家
    吴万才
    我叫吴万才，十五岁，河北昌顺县白浮村人。以前家中无房无地又无钱，生活没一点办法。从十二岁给人家放猪，放了二年。又去北京筛子铺当学徒。我母亲在家给邻居帮忙作活，不能剩钱，还得与作活主人说好听的话。人家要不用就没有饭吃。我母亲就去村外哭了一场。我也是不由的就流下眼泪。我那小时候的苦是说不尽的。到了现在，八路军解放了我们村庄。我从北平回到家里。我村村干部真办了许多好事。说我家是赤贫，分给我土地，房子得了一部分，浮财得了多一部分。这可算好过了。我又去小学校念书。我母亲有了活做，有了饭吃。今年三月二十八日，我哥哥来了一封信；他是在国民党军队里当兵，被解放军解放后参加了咱的队伍。他却来信叫我母亲给他送便衣；我想他必定是想开小差回家，那是不对的，千万不要那样办才好。快给我哥哥去信，不要叫他回家。劝他好好的干，当个解放军是光荣的，是帮助人民翻身。劳苦人民全会说好。我在家种地，村干部很帮助。咱家已过着很好的日子了！
