    Li Chengniang felt it was "damned bad luck" when she saw the two of them enter.

    Xiao'e sensed something was wrong and quickly changed the subject. She asked her husband, "Why did the meeting end so quickly today?"

    Her husband said, "This meeting was just to meet with a few cadres. The official meeting is tonight."

    After only a few simple words, everyone sat down, and no one had anything more to say. Jin Gui's expression was very unhappy.

    Jin Gui was usually very generous and didn't care what her mother-in-law said, but this time it was different: Xiao'e's husband was her brother-in-law, but also her superior. She thought that her mother-in-law was discrediting her in front of Xiao'e, and how could Xiao'e not tell her own husband? Moreover, if it was really her own mistake, it would be understandable, but she really hadn't done anything wrong, only her mother-in-law's views were incorrect, and she felt that she didn't deserve this injustice.

    Xiao'e's husband saw that the relationship between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was so bad, and couldn't determine which side was right. He usually trusted Jin Gui very much, praising her everywhere and telling the women in each village to learn from her. Now that he heard her mother-in-law was very dissatisfied with her, he suspected that he didn't understand the situation and might have trusted Jin Gui too much. Therefore, he wanted to investigate and research again. Seeing that everyone was silent, he wanted to deliberately tease Jin Gui. He smiled and asked Xiao'e, "What were you secretly talking about Jin Gui that made her pout?"

    Before Jin Gui could speak, Li Chengniang preemptively said, "Let her hear if she hears, I didn't wrong her! Ask her if she's picked up a needle or spun an inch of thread all winter?"

    Once the mother-in-law spoke, Jin Gui's face became much more amiable. Jin Gui was only afraid of not having the opportunity to defend herself, causing misunderstandings from her superiors. Now that it had been brought up again, she could explain it clearly face to face, so she felt very calm. She said, "Mother! What you said is all right, but it's a pity you can't do the math." She turned to Xiao'e's husband and said, "Brother-in-law, you calculate for me: Spinning a pound of cotton wastes two days and earns five sheng of rice; selling a load of coal or doing a day of other heavy work only wastes one day and also earns five sheng of rice. Tell me, is it better to spin thread or sell coal?"

    Xiao'e's husband smiled. He didn't need to answer Jin Gui and said to Xiao'e, "You also calculate it! Although they are both manual labor, Jin Gui's one day of labor is equivalent to your two days of labor! What I often say, 'Women must participate in major labor,' is about this calculation."

    Li Chengniang felt that she had lost, so she quickly changed to another reasonable matter. She said, "How can a woman not even make her own clothes and shoes and go to the market to buy them to wear?" She was sure that she could overwhelm her this time, and her voice was even louder.

    Jin Gui calmly said to her again, "I have also calculated this: It takes two days to sew a set of clothes yourself. Tailor shops use machines to sew and only charge five sheng of rice, which is better than what we sew. It takes seven days to make a pair of shoes yourself, and you have to use your own materials. Buying a ready-made pair at a shoe shop only costs one dou and a half of rice, which is better than what we make. I sell nine loads of coal in nine days, and five times nine earns four dou and five sheng, and sewing a set of clothes and buying a pair of shoes only costs two dou of rice in total. Why should I make them myself?"

    Before Jin Gui could finish, Li Chengniang became anxious again. She felt that she had lost twice and had to regain some face—even if she was wrong, she had to insist on being right—her voice became louder. She shouted, "What you do is right! All right! Nothing is unreasonable!" She shouted to her son-in-law, "You district cadres, you always advise everyone to save! I have lived my whole life and never heard of what 'saving' is, but I can't even eat a pound of oil a year, but this thrifty daughter-in-law eats a pound a month. You all know how to calculate, you are all cadres! Please calculate this account for me!"

    The louder she shouted, the more her son-in-law couldn't help but laugh. After she finished shouting, her son-in-law was already laughing so hard that he couldn't close his mouth. The son-in-law said, "Old lady! Don't worry! I can calculate this account for you: Two people eat a pound of oil a month, and one person doesn't even use three qian a day, which can't be considered too much. 'Saving' means not wasting. Things that must be used, not using them can't be considered wasting..."

    Li Chengniang said, "You cadres always protect each other! What must be used? I have lived this long eating chaff and vegetables!"

    Jin Gui said, "Mother! I'm just a little younger! Didn't I also grow up eating chaff? It's not just us who eat a little better these past few years. Ask around in the village, doesn't every family eat ten or twenty jin of oil a year?"

    Xiao'e's husband also helped Jin Gui and said, "Old lady! The world has changed now, it's changed to where we don't have to eat chaff! The revolution is to let us not eat chaff. If we wanted to eat chaff, who would revolt? This world is only just changing for the better. In the future, when machines are used to cultivate the land, the harvested grain will be two or three times what it is now, not to mention eating a pound of oil a month, we will have to eat meat every day!" His words seemed to have calmed Li Chengniang down. If he didn't say anything more, perhaps nothing would have happened, but unfortunately, he continued with a few more sentences, which led to a major incident. He continued, "Old lady! In my opinion, you should just eat and dress well, and live a few years of quiet life! You don't have to manage the affairs of the family!"

    "Is this the principle that you district cadres say? I won't care when I die, but if I'm not dead, I can't let others control me!" Li Chengniang got very angry and didn't bother to be polite with her son-in-law. She said that Jin Gui not doing work and being wasteful were not very important issues, the most important thing was that she hated Jin Gui for taking over as the head of the family, causing her to lose her leadership. The more she spoke, the angrier she became: "This is my home! She is the daughter-in-law I married, did I come first or did she come first?"

    Xiao'e's husband said, "Old lady! It's not that you shouldn't manage, it's that you are old and you don't understand the new things now! You can't manage!"

    "Can't manage? It's only been a year since she married in! I lived this long without a daughter-in-law before! If she has the ability, let her live separately! I don't want to benefit from her! She doesn't consult me about anything, she doesn't even discuss buying a donkey with me! Let her kill me first!"

    Jin Gui had never guessed that her mother-in-law was so hostile to her. When she heard her mother-in-law say this, she really got a little angry. She said, "Mother! You don't have to divide the family with me! If you want to manage, you can manage. I'll just have a clean break!" Saying that, she ran back to her room. Xiao'e thought she was going back to her room to commit suicide and quickly followed her. But when Xiao'e had just run to her door, she grabbed a small cloth bag, turned around and ran back to her mother-in-law's room, and said to her mother-in-law, "Mother! Let me hand over the accounts to you!"

    Xiao'e saw that things had already become a mess and quickly grabbed Jin Gui, saying, "Jin Gui! Don't make trouble! Mother is confused, you..."

    Xiao'e's husband was very calm: he neither advised Jin Gui nor advised his mother-in-law, but said to Xiao'e, "You don't have to be a peacemaker! I think it's good to have Jin Gui hand over the household affairs to the old lady! The old lady manages the household affairs, and Jin Gui can be more clean and can do more work!" He turned to Jin Gui and winked and said, "Jin Gui, don't be angry! Seriously, do you think it's right?"

    Jin Gui saw that her brother-in-law was helping her and immediately became amiable again, following her brother-in-law's words and saying, "Who's angry?" She said to her mother-in-law, "Mother! I'm not angry with you! I didn't know you wanted to manage this! If you had said so earlier, I would have handed it over to you a long time ago!" Saying that, she opened her small bag and took out an account book and several stacks of banknotes.

    Li Chengniang saw that her daughter-in-law had taken out an account book and thought that she was deliberately making things difficult for her, a person who couldn't read, so she said again, "I can't read, don't use that to trick me!"

    Jin Gui still said seriously, "How many words do I know? How dare I trick people? I'm not asking Mother to read! It's just that I can't remember if I don't look at the accounts!"

    Xiao'e's husband also climbed onto the bed and said, "Let me help you with the handover! Let's count the banknotes first!" He counted a stack and placed it in front of his mother-in-law, placing a stack and reporting the number—"These are 2,000 yuan of Jinnan currency, five bills totaling 10,000!" "These are two 2,000 yuan bills, one 1,000 yuan bill, and ten 500 yuan bills, also 10,000!"... He hadn't finished counting 30,000 yet, and his mother-in-law had already become confused, but she was too embarrassed to say that she couldn't take over, so she just interjected, "What's the use of making them all different colors, it's not as easy to count as the copper coins from before?" Her son-in-law didn't care what she said and continued to count, totaling 55,000 yuan of Jinnan currency.

    After counting the banknotes, Jin Gui continued to hand over the matters in the account book. She flipped through the account book and said, "In the cooperative's accounts, we owe them 61,000. They have received two dou of big sesame seeds from us, 16,000 per dou, two dou is 32,000. We should also get two or three million yuan in dividends, and you can settle the accounts with him after the dividends are distributed! In the mutual aid group, last winter, the sheep stepped on manure and owed them six sheng of sheep labor and food rice. We also have three old work tickets, one large one is one work unit, and two small ones are four-tenths of a work unit, totaling one point zero four units. This is the rice that we should get. Last autumn, the wages were low, one work unit was two and a half sheng. The group will hold a meeting the day after tomorrow to end last year's work accounts, and you have to clear it with them at that time..."

    The mother-in-law didn't understand a single item and already felt very annoyed. She said, "Why are there so many troublesome things? Who can remember all of that?"

    Xiao'e also felt worried for her mother. Seeing that her mother had spoken, she also advised her, "Mother! You should still let Jin Gui manage it. Why bother stirring up those troubles yourself? It's much more troublesome than the things in your black box!" Li Chengniang felt that there were not only more items than in the box, but also that they couldn't be wrapped or rolled, and it was really not easy to understand them in bundles. At this moment, she was willing to let Jin Gui manage it, but she didn't seem willing to immediately say anything embarrassing.

    Jin Gui continued to hand over the accounts. She said, "Don't worry, Mother! There are only five or six items left—a few items are with the village office, and a few items are with the market. In the differential service account, we have spent a total of ten man-days and eight donkey-days without settling the accounts. We have also managed the meals for several passing soldiers, and we haven't exchanged the rice tickets they gave us. These two, each is eleven liang. These five, each is..."

    "Too troublesome! I don't care! Whatever you do is what you do! I'll just eat a peaceful meal and be done with it!" Li Chengniang admitted defeat in a fit of pique and pushed the pile of banknotes beside her legs forward.

    Xiao'e's husband laughed loudly. He said, "Didn't I say that you should 'live a few years of quiet life'?" He said to Jin Gui, "Good, good! You continue to manage it!" He said to Xiao'e, "I often tell you to learn from Jin Gui, and that's to learn about this whole situation! Always talking about liberating women, if you women really want to be liberated, you have to do more things, manage more things, and understand more things! After we go back, I should also hand over the accounts to you like Jin Gui!" (End of full text)

    Xiao'e's husband said to Xiao'e: "I often tell you to learn from Jin Gui, that is to learn about this whole situation."

  　（三）
    李成娘一见他们两个人进来，觉着“真他娘的不凑巧”。
    小娥觉得不对，赶紧把话头引到另一边。她问自己的丈夫说：“今天的会怎么散得这样快？”
    他丈夫说：“这会只是和几个干部接一下头，到晚上才正式开会。”
    只说了这么几句简单话大家坐下了，谁也再没有什么话说，金桂的脸色就很不平和。
    金桂平常很大方，婆婆说两句满不在乎，可是这一次有些不同：小娥的丈夫是她的姐夫，可也是她的上级。她想婆婆在小娥面前败坏自己，小娥如何能不跟她自己的丈夫说？况且真要是自己的错误也还可说，自己确实没错，只是婆婆的见解不对，她觉得犯不着受这冤枉。
    小娥的丈夫见她们婆媳的关系这样坏，也断不定究竟那一方面对。他平常很信任金桂，到处表扬她，叫各村的妇女向她学习，现在听见她婆婆对她十分不满意，反疑惑自己不了解情况，对金桂保不定有点信任太过，因此，就想再来调查研究一番。他见大家都不说话，就想趁空子故意撩一撩金桂。他笑着问小娥：“你们背地里谈论人家金桂什么事，惹得人家鼓嘟着嘴！”
    金桂还没有开口，李成娘就抢先说：“听见叫她听见吧，我又没有屈说了她！你问她一冬天拈过一下针没有？纺过一寸线没有？”
    婆婆开了口，金桂脸上却又和气得多了。金桂只怕没有机会辩白，引起上级的误会，如今既然又提起来了，正好当面辩白清楚，因此反觉得很心平。她说：“娘！你说对都对，可惜是你不会算帐。”又回头向小娥的丈夫说：“姐夫你给我算着：纺一斤棉花误两天，赚五升米；卖一趟煤或做一天别的重活，只误一天，也赚五升米，你说还是纺线呀还是卖煤？”
    小娥的丈夫笑了。他用不着回答金桂就向小娥说：“你也算算吧！虽然都是手工劳动，可是金桂劳动一天抵住你劳动两天！我常说的‘妇女要参加主要劳动’就是要算这个帐。”
    李成娘觉得自己输了，就赶紧另换一件占理的事。她又说：“哪有这女人家连自己的衣裳鞋子都不做，到集上去买着穿？”她满以为这一下可要说倒她，声音放得更大了些。
    金桂不慌不忙又向她说：“这个我也是算过帐的：自己缝一身衣服得两天，裁缝铺用机器缝，只要五升米的工钱，比咱缝的还好。自己做一对鞋得七天，还得用自己的材料，到鞋铺买对现成的才用斗半米，比咱做的还好。我九天卖九趟煤，五九赚四斗五，缝一身衣服买一对鞋，一共才花二斗米，我为什么要自己做？”
    等不得金桂说完，李成娘就又发急了。她觉得两次都输了，总得再争口气——嗓子再放大一点，没理也得强占几分。她大喊起来：“你做的对！都对！没有一件没理的！”又向女婿喊：“你们这些区干部，成天劝大家节约节约！我活了一辈子，没有听说过什么是‘节约’，可是我一年也吃不了一斤油，我这节约媳妇来了是一月吃一斤。你们都会算帐，都是干部！就请你们给我算算这笔帐！”
    她越喊得响亮，女婿越忍不住笑，等她喊完了，女婿已笑得合不上口。女婿说：“老人家！你不要急！我可以替你算算这笔帐：两个人一月一斤油，一个人一天还该不着三钱，不能算多。‘节约’是不浪费的意思。非用不行的东西，用不了不能算是浪费……”
    李成娘说：“你们这些当干部的是官官相为！什么非用不行？我一辈子吃糠咽菜也活了这么大！”
    金桂说：“娘！我不过年轻点吧！还不是吃糠长大的？这几年也不是光咱吃得好一点，你到村里打听一下，不论哪家一年还不吃一二十斤油？”
    小娥的丈夫又帮着金桂说：“老人家！如今的世道变了，变得不用吃糠了！革命就是图叫咱们不吃糠，要是图吃糠谁还革命呢？这个世道还是才往好处变，将来用机器种起地来，打下的粮食能抵住如今两三倍，不说一月吃一斤油，一天还得吃顿肉哩！”他这番话似乎已经把李成娘的气给平下去了，要是不再说什么也许就没有事了，可是不幸又接着说了几句，就又引起了大事。他接着说：“老人家！依我说你只用好吃上些好穿上些，过几年清净日子算了！家里的事你不用管它！”
    “你们区干部就说是这种理？我死了就不管了，不死就不能由别人摆布我！”李成娘动了大气，也顾不上再和女婿讲客气。她说金桂不做活，浪费还都不是很重要的问题，最要紧的是恨金桂不该替她作了当家人，弄得她失掉了领导权。她又是越说越带气：“这是我的家！她是我娶来的媳妇，先有我来先有她来？”
    小娥的丈夫说：“老人家！不是说不该你管，是说你上年纪了，如今的新事情你有些摸不着！管不了！”
    “管不了？娶过媳妇才一年啊！从前没有媳妇我也活了这么大！她有本事叫她另过日子去！我不图沾她的光！大小事不跟我通一通风，买个驴都不跟我商量！叫她先把我灭了吧！”
    金桂向来还猜不到婆婆跟自己这样过不去，这会听婆婆这么一说，也真正动了点小脾气。她说：“娘！你也不用跟我分家了！你想管你就管，我落上一个清净算了！”说着就跑回自己房里去，小娥当她是回房去寻死，赶紧跟在她后面。可是当小娥才跑到她门口，她却挟了个小布包返出来又跑到婆婆的房子里，向婆婆说：“娘！让我交代你！”
    小娥看见已经呕成气了，赶紧拉住金桂说：“金桂！不要闹！娘是老糊涂了，你……”
    小娥的丈夫倒很沉得住气：他也不劝金桂也不劝丈母，倒向小娥说：“你不用和稀泥！我看就叫金桂把家务交代给老人家也好！老人家管住家务，金桂清净一点倒还能多做一点活！”又回头向金桂挤了挤眼说：“金桂你不要动气！说正经的，你说对不对？”
    金桂见姐夫是帮自己，马上就又转得和和气气地顺着姐夫的话说：“谁动气来？”又向婆婆说：“娘！我不是跟你生气！我不知道你想管这个！你早说来我早就交代你了！”说着就打开小包，取出一本帐和几叠票子来。
    李成娘见媳妇拿出帐本，还以为是故意难为她这不识字的人，就又说：“我不识字，不用拿那个来捉弄我！”
    金桂仍然正正经经说：“我才认得几个字？还敢捉弄人？我不是叫娘识字！我是自己不看帐记不得！”
    小娥的丈夫也爬到床边说：“让我帮你办交代！先点票子吧！”他点一叠向丈母娘跟前放一叠，放一叠报个数目——“这是两千元的冀南票，五张共是一万！”“这是两张两千的，一张一千的，十张五百的，也是一万！”……他还没有点够三万，丈母娘早就弄不清楚了，可是也不好意思说接管不了，只插了一句话说“弄成这各色各样的有什么好处，哪如从前那铜元好数？”女婿没有管她说什么，仍然点下去，点完了一共合冀南票五万五。
    点过了票，金桂就接着交代帐上的事。她翻着帐本说：“合作社的来往帐上，咱欠人家六万一。他收过咱二斗大麻子，一万六一斗，二斗是三万二。咱还该分两三万块钱红，等分了红以后你好跟他清算吧！互助组里去年冬天羊踩粪，欠人家六升羊工火食米。咱还存三张旧工票，一张大的是一个工，两张小的是四分工，共是一个零四分，这个是该咱得米，去年秋后的工资低，一个工是二升半。大后天组里就要开会结束去年的工帐，到那时候要跟人家找清………”
    婆婆连一宗也没有听进去，已经觉得很讨厌。她说：“怎么有这么多的穷事情？麻麻烦烦谁记得住？”
    小娥听着也替娘发愁，见娘说了话，也跟着劝娘说：“娘！你就还叫金桂管吧，自己搅那些麻烦作甚哩？这比你黑箱子里那东西麻烦得多哩！”李成娘觉着不止比箱子里的东西样数多，并且是包也没法包，卷也没法卷，实在不容易一捆一捆弄清楚，他这会倒是愿意还叫金桂管，可也似乎还不愿意马上说丢脸话。
    金桂仍然交代下去，她说：“不怕娘！只剩五六宗了——有几宗是和村公所的，有几宗是和集上的，差务帐上咱一共支过十个人工八个驴工，没有算帐。咱还管过好几回过路军人的饭，人家给咱的米票咱还没有兑。这两张，每张是十一两。这五张，每张是…………。”
    “实在麻烦！我不管了！你弄成什么算什么！我吃上个清净饭算拉到！”李成娘赌气认了输，把腿边的一堆票子往前一推。
    小娥的丈夫哈哈大笑起来。他说：“我原来不是说叫你‘过几年清净日子算子’吗？”又向金桂说：“好好好！你还管起来吧！”又向小娥说：“我常叫你们跟金桂学习，就是叫学习这一大摊子！成天说解放妇女解放妇女，你们妇女想真得到解放，就得多做些事，多管点事，多懂点事！咱们回去以后，我倒应该照金桂这样交代交代你！”（全文完）
