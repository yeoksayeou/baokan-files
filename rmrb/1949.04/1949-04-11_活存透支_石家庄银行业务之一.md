　　Overdraft on Current Deposits
　　——One of the Banking Businesses in Shijiazhuang
　　Xin Ru
　　　　　(I)
　　Last year, the total amount of various deposits and loans of the Shijiazhuang Branch of the People's Bank of China was more than 39,287,700 yuan in the new currency, of which overdrafts on current deposits accounted for more than 90%. Because this business is suitable for the flexible use of funds by both the customer and the bank, and is also an effective method for the bank to attract deposits, it has become one of the bank's main businesses.
　　　　(II)
　　The main state-owned enterprises in the city include railways, Daxing Cotton Mill, Zhengtai Coal and Iron Company, and trade companies. The overdraft period for these units is generally one to three months, and at most no more than four months, mainly determined based on the following situations: (1) Seasonal purchase of raw materials and supplies. (2) Reserve of necessary raw materials and supplies. (3) Turnover before products or materials are sold. (4) Special tasks or emergency needs. Cooperation dealings are mainly handled through the Cooperative General Society. In addition to calculating interest according to private industrial standards, the overdraft period and limit are the same as for state-owned enterprises.
　　Private industries also follow the seasonal production rules, and the overdraft period is generally determined based on the time required from purchasing raw materials, processing to finished products, and exchanging back to currency (the entire process). The overdraft limit generally does not exceed the amount of capital. The overdraft period for private businesses mainly depends on their transportation and sales process, and the limit in principle does not exceed two-thirds of the capital.
　　In addition, the bank once promoted mortgage overdrafts for materials such as cotton, grain, cloth, and salt to private merchants, but since credit overdrafts were already allowed, why would merchants bother with mortgages? As a result, it didn't work. Only four or five mortgage overdrafts were made last year, generally mortgaged at 60% of the value of the goods, and the other conditions were the same as for private merchants.
　　The above principles are to adopt a policy of strong support for state-owned enterprises and cooperative societies, and there is a certain distinction between state-owned and private, industry and commerce, which is completely correct. However, the specific implementation must also consider the nature of the business, giving priority in order and amount. The conditions for private industry and commerce must also be handled differently depending on the extent to which they benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. It seems that it is still possible to consider whether the limits in the past regulations are appropriate. In addition, from the bank's own management perspective, within the prescribed principles, the overdraft period should be shortened as much as possible and the limit lowered. Because large numbers are difficult to control, and a long period results in slow turnover, which is equivalent to fixed-term loans. In order to prevent improper use and appropriate use of funds, the branch specifically stated in the overdraft contract: "If it is deemed necessary to recover the principal and interest early or stop the overdraft, the overdraft account and the guarantor have the obligation to repay immediately."
　　There is always a gap between the general overdraft limit and the actual overdraft amount within a certain period of time. The proper use of funds lies in mastering and estimating these differences. Finding out the customer's rules for using funds, whether it is small withdrawals or whole withdrawals? At the same time, find the overlaps in the accounts from the time and numbers, especially for a few large accounts that have a decisive effect, and must always understand their activities, pay attention to their deposit and withdrawal rules and the transfer relationship with their related accounts.
　　If the overdraft expires and cannot be repaid, it is generally only allowed to be extended for another period, but most of those who request an extension have credit problems, and there are very few who really need it for turnover. Therefore, in reality, there are still cases where it is extended for several periods but the loan cannot be repaid.
　　In short, the use of funds is to implement policies, but it must be used appropriately, which is precisely the characteristic of overdraft on current deposits.
　　　　(III)
　　Overdraft on current deposits is an important business of the bank, but it can only exert its effectiveness when it is closely linked to correct policies. In the second half of last year, the deposit balance of state-owned enterprises in Shijiazhuang accounted for 94.3% of the total deposit balance, private industry and commerce accounted for 3.8%, and cooperatives accounted for 1.5%. In terms of loans, the loan balance of state-owned enterprises accounted for 75.2%, private industry and commerce accounted for 15.8%, and cooperatives accounted for 9%.
　　It can be seen from this ratio that the overdraft amount of state-owned enterprises is less than the deposit amount, while the situation of private industry and commerce is just the opposite. According to the bank's statistics, a few large enterprises often deposit very large numbers, but there is no overdraft or only one or two overdrafts throughout the year. The real overdraft numbers of state-owned enterprises are all accounted for by several agency production units. Private merchants establish dealings with the bank to use the bank's funds. Looking only at the accumulated deposit numbers, private industry and commerce, especially commerce, have larger deposit numbers than state-owned enterprises, but that is the number accumulated by deposits made in the shortest time, which shows that it turns over quickly and flexibly. Conversely, state-owned enterprises often have a large amount of idle funds in the bank, and have not fully exerted the power of management, which is a phenomenon that deserves attention. In the past, under the ideas of capital preservation and blind development of production in the branch, many of these idle funds exceeded the prescribed overdraft limits, and were even lent out without selecting targets. Here is a typical example: The capital of Lisheng Grocery Store in Nanxiaojie is only equivalent to 1,000 yuan in the new currency, but the overdraft limit set by the branch for it often reaches 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and up to 40,000 yuan at the highest. In July last year, when the store transported goods back from Linqing, it caught up with rising prices, and earned 30,000 yuan in one trip. The shopkeeper said: "It is the first time in decades of doing business that I have earned such a large profit."
　　After the branch was ordered to cooperate in stabilizing the market and stopped lending in November last year, it cleared up the erroneous thinking in the loans. Recently, it will improve the overdraft business in accordance with the new policy.

　　活存透支
    ——石家庄银行业务之一
    辛茹
  　　　　　（一）
    中国人民银行石家庄分行去年各种存放款总额合新币三千九百二十八万七千七百多元，其中活存透支占百分之九十以上，因为这门业务适合于主顾双方对资金的灵活运用，也是银行吸收存款有效方法，所以就成为银行主要业务之一。
    　　　　（二）
    本市主要公营企业有铁路、大兴纱厂、正太煤铁公司、贸易公司等，这些单位活存透支时间一般是一个月到三个月，最多不超过四个月，大致根据以下几种情况来决定：（一）季节性的购买原料、物资。（二）储备必要的原料、物资。（三）产品或物资出售以前的周转。（四）特殊任务或紧急需要。合作方面的往来主要通过合作总社办理，除按私人工业标准计算利息，透支时期和限度都和公营企业一样。
    私人工业也是按生产季节性的规律，一般是根据购买原料、加工到成品换回货币（整个过程）需要的时间来决定透支时间，透支限度一般不超过资本额。私人商业透支时间主要看它运销的过程，限度原则上不超过资本的三分之二。
    另该行曾经向私商宣传举办棉、粮、布、盐等物资抵押透支，但既允许信用透支商人又何苦做抵押呢？结果没有行通，去年抵押透支只做了四、五笔，一般按货值六成抵押，其余条件都和私商一样。
    以上几项原则对公营企业及合作社往来是采取大力扶植的方针，对公营与私营，工业与商业，都有了一定的区别，这是完全正确的。但具体的执行还必须看经营性质分别先后和多少，私营工商业的条件亦须看它对国计民生有益的程度来分别处理，过去规定中的限度，是否适当，似还可以考虑。另从银行本身经营管理来看，在规定的原则之内，应尽量使透支的时间缩短，限额压低。因为数字大了掌握困难，时间长了周转慢，无异于定期贷款，为了防止不正当的用途及适当的运用资金，分行在透支契约上特别注明：“若认为有提早收回本息或停止透支之必要时，透支户与保人有立即清还之义务。”
    一般的透支额度与实透数之间，在一定时间都是有距离的，运用资金恰当就在善于掌握与估计这些差度。找出客户用款的规律，是零支还是整取？同时从时间和数字上找出户头的交错，特别对少数有决定作用的大户头，必须随时了解他们的活动，注意他们存取规律及与他们有关户头的拨帐关系。
    透支期满不能还款一般只允许再转一期，但做转期要求的多是信用发生问题，真正因周转需要的很少，因此实际上连着转好几期还不了款也还是有的。
    总之，运用资金是为了贯彻政策，但必须运用恰当，这正是活存透支的特点。
    　　　　（三）
    活存透支是银行重要的业务，但只有和正确的政策紧紧结合才能发挥他的效能。石家庄去年下半年公营企业的存款余额占总存余额百分之九十四点三，私营工商业占百分之三点八，合作社占百分之一点五。放款方面，公营企业放款余额占百分之七十五点二，私营工商业占百分之十五点八，合作社占百分之九。
    从这个比例中可以看出公营企业的透支数不及存款数多，而私营工商业情形刚刚相反，据该行统计，少数大企业经常存入数字很大，而全年竟无一次透支或只有一两次透支，公营企业真正透支数字都是为几个机关生产单位占着，私商与银行订立往来是想用银行的款，光看存款积累数，私营工商业特别是商业比公营企业存款数字还大，但那是用最短时间存入的数字堆积起来的，这说明他周转得快，灵活。相反的公营企业却经常有大批闲散资金存在银行里，没有充分发挥经营的力量，这一现象值得注意。过去在分行保本主义和盲目发展生产的思想下，这批闲散资金很多都是超过了规定的透支限度，甚至不选择对象的贷出去了的，这里举一个典型的例子：南小街力生杂货庄资金仅合新币千元，分行与他定的透支额度经常达两三万元，最高到四万元，去年七月，该号到临清运货回来，赶上物价上涨，一趟生意就赚了三万元，该号掌柜的说：“做几十年生意第一次赚这样大的利。”
    去年十一月分行奉命配合稳定市场停止出款后，清算了贷款中的错误思想，最近将根据新的方针改进活存透支业务。
