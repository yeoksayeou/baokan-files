　　Rectifying Traffic to Prevent Accidents
  　Ping City Public Security Bureau Proposes Specific Measures
    [This newspaper report] The recent car accident incidents have drawn the attention of the Ping City Public Security Bureau. Earlier this month, the bureau invited the automobile workers' union, the drivers' union, the 41st Army Garrison Department, the motor vehicle company, and other relevant departments to study the causes of car accidents and discuss solutions. The bureau has now put forward its opinions on traffic rectification, which the reporter has learned are as follows: 1. Formulate traffic management rules and call on pedestrians and the general public to pay attention to compliance; 2. Expand publicity and educate the general public, especially drivers, on traffic knowledge; 3. Order traffic police to be proactive and responsible, and dedicated to their duties; and require pedestrians and drivers to obey the directions of traffic police. (Chen Ji)
