　　Today's Tangshan
　　By our correspondents Lin Li and Lu Hao
　　The famous national industrial and mining hub – Tangshan, truly deserves to be called a city of workers!
　　Before liberation, the workers of Tangshan carried out heroic work in protecting the mines and factories, ensuring that all machinery remained intact and resuming operations completely within a day or two.
　　To compete for the red banner of "Production Model" for May Day, the Tangshan Machine Factory, employing over four thousand eight hundred workers, is caught up in an unprecedented production surge. According to the original plan of the director of the factory's carriage workshop, in addition to repairing thirty passenger and freight cars each in April, they also planned to assemble half of a fire-damaged passenger car. After consulting with the workers, they added another car to the plan for renovation, and in fact, they will be able to complete two cars. Not only that, but the passenger car repair team and the freight car repair team volunteered to dismantle two more cars. The undercarriage team also said: "We will also dismantle one car, and let's see who uses less labor." Repairing a fire-damaged passenger car is not simple. In the past, it required 1,500 man-hours, and coupled with a shortage of calcium carbide, only four cars were dismantled and assembled throughout the year. How much power do the workers actually have? We asked many people, but no one could answer, and there was no way to answer. The two clocks in the main building and the passenger car workshop are signs for starting and ending work. Now the workshop wants to hang a clock and the Pan-Nan workshop wants to hang a rail, otherwise, the symphony of pneumatic hammers, iron hammers, and various machines is so loud that even eating and leaving work cannot be heard. The workers of the steelmaking plant, who have already broken through previous production records, mobilized workers to work overtime on Sunday a few days ago so that a batch of steel could be shipped on time. But the workers said: "In order to welcome May Day, we don't need to work overtime, we will finish it today." So, everyone came to help. Li Guiyou, who was in charge of the warehouse, would run back to the warehouse if someone came to pick up goods, and run back to help with cutting steel if no one came. Yang Wenming, who was watching the electric roller, would run back to check the machine, and then run back to help. Everyone worked desperately, sweating profusely, and as a result, they only worked one more hour a day and completed two days' work. Their February output was 196 tons, and even though the furnace was broken for eight days in March, they maintained 198 tons. The output for twenty-three days in April reached 250 tons, exceeding the steelmaking plant's historical peak of 227 tons. In the Sino-private joint venture, Huaxin Textile Factory, in the days leading up to May Day, it was already a lot to spin eighteen hanks of cotton roving, but now Su Xiuzhen, who has the highest record, spins as many as 22.1 hanks. Their eyes are always watching other people's hank counters, and sometimes when the cotton roving is not supplied in time, they snatch it. Sometimes the bobbins in the coarse yarn room are not used up, so they pour the cotton roving on the ground to grab the bobbins, creating a tense and fiery atmosphere of competition.
　　The Tangshan People's Government is also making great efforts to help private industry recover. The nationally famous Qixin Cement Company, before liberation, had cement piled up like mountains, on the verge of collapse, and workers were unable to receive wages for two months. After liberation, the state trading agencies successively loaned it 9,000 bags of flour and took responsibility for selling all of its products. In March, it had recovered to an average monthly output of 11,000 tons last year. The factory originally had a partial contracting system, where the factory contracted out six or seven carts per work unit, and paid the workers thirteen or fourteen carts per work unit. Recently, this unreasonable system was abolished, and the workers jumped for joy. Gao Yuankui, who is fifty years old, has worked on Stone Mountain for thirty-one years and still owed a lot of money last year. Now he says: "If things continue like this for three to five years, my life will get better." Beitai, the factory's limestone production area, used to produce just over 500 carts a day, but now it produces more than 650 carts a day. The Kailuan miners, who had suffered greatly, were helped by the state trading agencies to drive out the profiteers who colluded with the mine to sell coal tickets and noodle tickets, and recently they are preparing to abolish the dark and heavy contracting system. The People's Government is also providing great support for the mine's resumption of production, and recently loaned the mine 300 million yuan in People's Currency as working capital, and is responsible for purchasing 1.7 million kiln props from the Northeast on behalf of the mine to solve the material difficulties. The state railway is actively transporting coal for the mine to increase transportation volume, and the export coal tax has been specially reduced by half from 30 percent. Today, the mine's coal production is also gradually recovering. In contrast, the Kuomintang once severely destroyed Tangshan's industry. The Japanese had established a Tangshan Ironworks with twenty smelting furnaces, with a maximum daily output of 400 tons and employing over a thousand workers, a large-scale operation. However, the corrupt and incompetent Kuomintang officials allowed the stored iron to rust, sold it to pot makers, used the factory buildings as shelters, the machines were scattered, and the smelting furnaces were almost completely destroyed, becoming a scene of collapsed walls and rubble.
　　Tangshan, an industrial and mining hub, is now also beginning to work hard to manufacture agricultural machinery. The Tangshan Iron Factory was originally a dilapidated Kuomintang arsenal. When we took over, the workers had not received wages for three months, the factory had sold the electric rollers, dismantled the planer to make a platform frame, and even a set square could not be found. Now the People's Government has loaned 80,000 jin of millet, and the workers are reorganizing the machines day and night, striving to rush out 150 iron-wheeled water carts for the farmers of Ninghe County before May Day. The machines that used to specialize in repairing firearms are now machining parts for cutting grass machines.
　　Today, the workers of Tangshan, facing May, are using their labor enthusiasm to support the People's Liberation Army in annihilating the enemy in the south of the Yangtze River and are working hard for the construction of the new country!

　　今日唐山
    本报记者  林里  陆灏
    著名全国的工矿重镇——唐山，不愧是个工人的城市！
    唐山工人在解放以前，曾进行了英勇的护矿护厂工作，使所有机器完整无损，并在一两天内全部复工。
    为了争夺五一“生产模范”的那面鲜红的大旗，拥有四千八百余工人的唐山机厂，正卷入从未有过的生产热潮中。按该厂车架所主任原来的计划，四月份除了装修客、货车各三十辆外，还打算按装半辆火灾客车。和工人商量以后，计划上又增加再装修一辆，而事实上则能完成两辆。这还不算，修客车组和修货车组又自报奋勇再拆卸两辆。车底组也说：“我们也拆一辆，还要看谁用工少。”修复一辆火灾客车，很不简单，过去，人工就要用一千五百个，加上缺乏电石，去年全年只拆装了四辆。工人的力量究竟有多大？我们问过很多人，没有一个人可以回答，也无法回答。大楼上和客车所两个钟，是上下工的记号，现在要本所挂颗钟，跑盘南还吊根铁轨，否则现在风锤、铁锤和各种机器交响的声音，连吃饭、下工也听不见。已突破以往任何时候产量的制钢厂工人，前几天为了一批钢能按时运走，动员工人们在星期天加班完成。但工人们说：“为了迎接五一，不要加班，今天我们就要赶出来。”于是，大家全来帮忙，看库房的李贵有，有人来领货，他就跑回去，没有人领货，他就跑来协助剪钢。看电滚子的杨文明，一会儿跑回去看看机器，一会儿又跑回来帮忙，大家拼命的干，汗流满面，结果一天只多做了一个钟头，就完成了两天的工作。他们二月份的产量是一百九十六吨，三月份坏了八天炉，还保持了一百九十八吨，而四月份二十三天的产量，就达到二百五十吨，超过了制钢厂历史上二百二十七吨的最高产量。公私合营的华新纺织厂，在迎接五一的日子里，棉条间本来纺十八个亨司就不多，现在纪录最高的苏秀珍，竟纺到二十二、一亨司。她们的眼睛，都留心别人的亨司表，有时棉条供给不上，就抢起来，粗纱间的筒子有时还没有用完，她们就把棉条倒在地上抢筒子，紧张烘火，一片竞赛声。
    唐山人民政府也在用大力帮助私营工业恢复。全国有名的启新洋灰公司，在解放前，洋灰堆积如山，饱胀欲死，工人两个月拿不到工资。解放后，经国家贸易机关先后贷给其白面九千袋，并负责包销其全部产品，三月份已恢复到去年月出一万一千吨的平均产量。该厂本有部份包工制，他们从厂方由六、七车算一工包出，给工人每工以十三、十四车计算。最近废除了此种不合理的制度，工人们欢喜得跳脚。五十岁的高元奎在石头山上干了三十一年，去年还欠了一身债，现在他说：“象这样再过三、五年，我的日子就好起来了。”该厂灰石出产地北大，过去每天不过出五百多车，现在则日出六百五十余车。曾经遭受痛苦的开滦矿工，国家贸易机关帮助他们驱逐了与矿方勾结的贩卖煤票面票的奸商，最近并准备废除黑暗重重的包工制。人民政府对于该矿之恢复生产，也予极大的支持，最近又以人民券三亿贷给矿方以周转资金，并负责代矿方向东北购买窑柱一百七十万根，以解决材料的困难。国家铁路正积极为矿方运煤提高运输量，并将出口煤税特许从百分之三十减低一半，今日该矿煤的产量也在逐渐恢复。与此相反，国民党曾经严重的摧毁过唐山的工业，日本人曾经办过一个唐山制铁所，有化铁炉二十个，日产最高可达四百吨，有工人千余名，规模庞大。但腐败无能的国民党接收大员，却让存着的铁长了铁锈，卖给铸锅的，让厂房当了收容所，机器四分五散，化铁炉也被破坏殆尽，变得如今墙倒壁坍，一片瓦砾。
    工矿重镇的唐山，现在也开始为制造农业机械而努力，唐山铁工厂原是国民党一个破烂不堪的修械所，我们接管的时候，工人们已经三个月领不到工钱，厂里卖掉了电滚子，把刨床拆成做平台架子，甚至连一根三角尺也找不见，现在人民政府贷给了八万斤小米，工人们重整机器，正在日以继夜，争取在五一节前，为宁河县的农民赶制一百五十辆铁盘水车，过去专门修理枪械的机器，如今则在旋刨铡草机上的零件。
    今日唐山的工人，面向着五月，正以自己的劳动热情，在支援解放军江南杀敌，在为新国家的建设而努力！
