　　Three Words and Two Phrases

　　Overcoming Formalism in Leading Mutual Aid Production
　　Some shortcomings in mutual aid in the semi-old district of Xingtai reflect that our cadres leading mutual aid production are confined to a set of old experiences in the past, pursuing formalistic practices such as "advanced forms" and "large-scale mutual aid", and neglecting that mutual aid production is collective production on the basis of the individual economy. It must be voluntary, equivalent, and democratic in order to truly exert the enthusiasm of farmers. It is necessary to go through in-depth and arduous work and typical demonstrations to change the practice of forced-command organization so that farmers can feel the benefits of being organized and voluntarily unite. At the same time, farmers themselves also require mutual aid and labor exchange, but they are unwilling to have strict organizational forms and complicated grading and scoring. Therefore, the so-called "advanced" and "large-scale" formalism that existed in leading mutual aid production in some old areas in the past was already a practice that did not meet the requirements of the vast number of farmers. Applying it to new and semi-old areas will inevitably not work. Therefore, in leading mutual aid production, whether in old, semi-old, or new areas, it is necessary to overcome the old set of formalism and allow the masses to freely join and withdraw from groups and organize flexibly. Only by organizing in this way can it be conducive to improving production efficiency and helping farmers develop their production and become rich.
　　
    Guarantee Military Grain
　　The Guancheng County of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Province inspected the storage conditions of public grain warehouses and found empty storage, borrowing, and unauthorized use. This bad phenomenon should also attract the attention of all regions. Whether or not the storage of public grain is responsible is the key to ensuring the supply of military grain. Guancheng has formulated various measures such as timely inspection, recovery of arrears, punishment of private use, and strict systems to prevent public grain from suffering undue losses. Grain depots in various regions should also clearly stipulate methods and systems and resolutely implement them to avoid affecting military needs!

　　三言两语
  　克服领导互助生产的形式主义
    邢台半老区互助中的某些缺点，反映出我们的领导生产互助的干部，拘泥于过去的一套陈旧经验，追求“高级形式”、“大型互助”等形式主义的作法，忽略了互助生产，乃是个体经济基础上的集体生产，必须自愿、等价、民主，才能真正发挥农民劳作积极性。一定要经过深入的艰苦工作，典型示范，改变强迫命令编组的作法，才能让农民感受组织起来的好处而自愿结合。同时，农民自身虽也要求互助变工，但不愿有严格的组织形式，复杂的分等、记分。所以，在过去老区某些地方领导互助生产时的所谓“高级”、“大型”等的形式主义一套，原已是不合乎广大农民要求的作法，以之搬到新区、半老区，则必然会行不通。因此，领导互助生产，不论在老区、半老区、新区等各种地区，必须克服形式主义的老一套，让群众可以自由入组退组，灵活组织，如此组织起来，才能有利于提高生产效率，有利于农民生产发家。
    保证军粮
    冀鲁豫观城县检查公粮仓库保管状况，发现空存借支，私自动用，这种不良现象，也应引起各地注意。公粮保管的负责与否，是能否保证军粮供应的关键。观城已订出及时检查，追缴欠粮，处分私用，严格制度等各项办法，使公粮不致蒙受不应有的损失，各地粮库亦应明确规定办法与制度，坚决执行，以免影响军需！
