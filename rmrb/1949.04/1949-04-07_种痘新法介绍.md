　　Introduction to the New Method of Vaccination
　　Anti-epidemic Department of the Health Department of the North China Military Region

　　Since the beginning of spring, smallpox has been prevalent in various regions. In order to prevent its spread, health authorities in various places are promoting universal vaccination.

　　The Anti-epidemic Department of our North China Military Region Health Department has issued a batch of cowpox vaccines for use in various regions (distributed by the Military Pharmaceutical Office). However, the vaccination methods in various regions mostly rely on old experiences, and the procedures are inconsistent, resulting in a large waste of cowpox vaccine. Especially now that the liberated areas are constantly expanding, there is a great need for vaccines in various places, and the foreign products on the market are of varying quality (reports have already reported sellers of expired vaccines). This has created a situation of supply falling short of demand. If we rationally use the existing vaccines and adopt new methods, we will not only save a lot in terms of economy (this is secondary), but most importantly, we will expand the scope of preventing smallpox transmission and protect more people from smallpox, which is something that every health worker should pay attention to.

　　The new method of using cowpox vaccine is introduced as follows:

　　1. Take the vaccine tube and thoroughly wipe its outside (especially the pointed ends) with an alcohol cotton ball (cotton ball soaked in 70% alcohol).

　　2. Take a wine glass (or glass plate or porcelain bowl), also disinfect with alcohol, and break off both ends of the vaccine tube as much as possible, allowing the vaccine to flow naturally into the wine glass.

　　3. Disinfect the skin of the person to be vaccinated with alcohol (preferably on the outer side of the upper arm). The disinfection area should be about one square inch.

　　4. Take a large sewing needle and thoroughly wipe it with an alcohol cotton ball. It is best to burn it on an alcohol lamp and wait for it to cool before using the needle tip to dip into the vaccine in the cup (to use less vaccine, scrape the needle a few times on the edge of the container holding the vaccine, so that only a small amount of vaccine remains on the needle tip).

　　5. After the alcohol on the skin of the person to be vaccinated has dried, use the needle tip dipped in vaccine to draw two straight lines on the skin (crossing or parallel). They should not be too long, about two or three minutes (or press the needle flat about twenty times). Be careful to just break the skin, but not show any bleeding marks.

　　6. Put on clothes after the skin at the vaccination site is dry.

　　The new vaccination method is simple, painless, saves vaccination time, and especially saves a lot of vaccine, and the vaccination results are very good.

　　New method vaccination must be carried out collectively. Otherwise, the vaccine will still be wasted.

　　The vaccine produced by the Anti-epidemic Department of the Health Department of the North China Military Region is sufficient for one person to be vaccinated with one dose, and multiple doses are not necessary. Each dose can vaccinate more than 100 people, and at least 40 people. It is a great waste if each dose is used for three or five people or more than ten people, which affects the universal prevention of smallpox.

　　The old method of using a vaccination knife, blowing the vaccine with the mouth, and vaccinating several doses to one person at the same time should no longer be used.

### 种痘新法介绍

　　种痘新法介绍
    华北军区卫生部防疫处
    入春以来，各地天花流行，为了预防蔓延，各卫生机关，均在推行普遍种痘。
    我华北军区卫生部防疫处，已发出一批牛痘苗供各地使用（统由军药处分发）；但各地种痘法，多凭旧日经验，手续不一，使牛痘苗的浪费很大。特别现在解放区不断扩大，各方需要痘苗很多，而市面的外来品，真假不一（报上已报导有卖过期痘苗者），如此造成了供不应求的情况。我们如果将现有痘苗合理使用，采行新法，将不但在经济方面可节省很多（这是次要的），最主要的是扩大了防止天花传染的范围，使更多的人免受天花侵袭，这是每一卫生工作同志应引起注意的。
    兹介绍使用牛痘苗新法如下：
    一、取痘苗管将其外面（特别是两端尖头）用酒精棉球（棉球用百分之七十的酒精浸过）充分拭擦。
    二、取一酒杯（或玻璃板磁碗均可），亦用酒精消毒，将痘苗管尽量折去两端，使痘浆自然流入酒杯内。
    三、受接种人之皮肤，用酒精消毒（最好在上臂外侧），消毒范围，约一方寸左右即可。
    四、取一大缝衣针，用酒精棉球充分拭擦。最好再在酒精灯上烧一下，等冷后用针尖蘸取杯内痘浆（为使少蘸痘浆，将针于盛痘浆家具边上，刮几下，使针尖上留有少量的痘浆即可）。
    五、待受接种人之皮肤上酒精干后，用蘸有痘浆之针尖，于皮肤上划两直线（交又与平行均可），不宜太长，约二三分左右（或用针平压二十次左右亦可）。注意皮肤刚刺破，但不显出血痕为度。
    六、待接种处皮肤干后再穿上衣服。
    新法种痘手续简单，毫无苦痛，又可节省种痘时间，特别可节省大量痘浆，发痘很好。
    新法种痘，必须集体进行。不然，仍要浪费痘苗。
    华北军区卫生部防疫处出品的痘苗，一人种一颗已足，不必多种。每支可种百人以上，最低亦可种四十人。如每支种三五人或十余人，这是很大的浪费，影响对天花的普遍预防。
    旧法种痘时用种痘刀，又用口吹痘浆，并一人同时种痘数颗之方法，不宜再用。
