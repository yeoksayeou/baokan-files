　　Beiping East Railway Station

  　Pickpocketing Greatly Reduced
    [Ping City News] Beiping East Railway Station, with more than 20,000 passengers daily, has gradually established revolutionary order, and the pickpockets commonly seen in the past have gradually decreased. The pickpockets at the East Railway Station mainly come from two gangs, one from Beiping and one from Tianjin. The Tianjin gang mostly committed thefts in Beiping, while the Beiping gang mostly committed thefts in Tianjin. Whenever the station was in chaos, they would mingle with the passengers getting on and off the trains, or disguise themselves as merchants or students, mixing in the trains to steal passengers' luggage, clothing, and money. During the Kuomintang era, some military officers also colluded with them, selling them an army unit number, which allowed them to wear a "soldier's" uniform to protect themselves.

    After the liberation of Beiping, the railway authorities adopted a policy of education and reform towards them, telling them that they should live by their own labor and not steal. They gradually awakened and began to resolutely turn over a new leaf. Pickpocket Li Yitang said with emotion: "I really hate myself, why did I do this! I will definitely work hard when I go back, and I will also advise our colleagues not to do this anymore." After many people returned, they actively helped the railway authorities to investigate and reform their colleagues. According to investigations, none of the pickpockets who filled out confessions and were released have relapsed to this day. Therefore, theft cases at the East Station have gradually decreased. In the past month, an average of seven or eight thieves were arrested every day, but in April, this number has been reduced to two or three. The railway police responsible for maintaining order told reporters that to further solve the problem of thieves, it is necessary to make them participate in productive labor! Such as street sweeping, participating in brick kilns and factory work, etc.

　　北平东车站
  　小偷大见减少
    【平市讯】每天有两万多乘客的北平东车站，逐步建立起革命秩序，过去所常见的小偷，现已渐渐减少了。东车站的小偷，主要为北平和天津两帮，天津帮多在北平行窃，北平帮多在天津行窃。每当车站秩序混乱时，他们混入上下车的旅客行列里，或者化装商人、学生的模样，混在列车里，偷窃旅客的行李衣物和钞票。在国民党时代，有些军官也和他们勾结，卖给他们一个部队番号，就能穿上一件“丘八”衣服，保护自己。
    北平解放后，铁路当局对他们采用了教育改造的方针，告诉他们应当靠劳动生活，不应偷窃。他们逐渐觉悟，开始下决心改邪归正。小偷李义堂感动地说：“我真恨我自己，为什么干这行！我回去一定好好劳动，还要劝告我们的同行，再不要干这一套。”好多人回去后，真的积极帮助铁路当局清查与改造他们的同行。据调查，凡是填写了悔过书被释放的小偷，到今天为止，确实没有重犯的。因此东站的窃案已日渐减少。在上一个月，每天平均要捕获七、八个窃犯，四月份已减到二、三名。负责维持秩序的铁路警察向记者说，为进一步解决窃犯问题，还需要使他们参加生产劳动！如扫街、参加砖窑和工厂工作等。
