Not Studying is a Killer!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Bai Hua
　　You ask me why I must study culture diligently? It's a long story! Not to mention the distant past, just take the lesson we learned during the battle to take back Gui Sui when we were operating independently. The regiment commander personally told me: "Your company is responsible for the most important direction for reconnaissance and security. You must be careful this time! If you fail to complete the mission, you will be fully responsible!"
　　I thought to myself: Hmm! I may not be good at other things, but fighting is my forte; plus the instructor is good at both politics and culture, so what's there to fear?!
　　"Right! I'll take full responsibility for everything!" I confidently agreed and returned to my post.
　　The night was quiet, without a sound... Time passed like flowing water: nine o'clock, ten o'clock, eleven o'clock... It seemed like there wouldn't be any enemy activity tonight, so I went to sleep peacefully.
　　"Report!" The loud voice of Zhang Shengui, the regiment headquarters' messenger, woke me up. I reluctantly opened my sleepy eyes, took the "order" from his hand, and called for the instructor. No response; I looked around and realized he had gone out to check the sentries. Under the flickering light of the bean oil lamp, I recognized that it was indeed an "order," because I had seen those two words too many times.
　　I guessed: it's either an enemy situation report or an alert to prepare for departure at dawn. But I immediately remembered: the last time we were stationed, the regiment headquarters sent a notice giving us two light machine guns and ninety hand grenades, but I thought it was just a report and hastily wrote a "received" and then ran to the regiment headquarters. The chief of staff was walking back and forth in the yard and, noticing me, immediately asked sternly why we hadn't picked up the weapons. I felt like he was talking nonsense, and after a scolding, I could only swallow my anger – bitterness in my heart.
　　The lesson of illiteracy flashed into my mind again. My head felt hot, which reminded me of past frustrations. I put on my cotton coat and went to take a stroll in the yard…
　　"Company Commander Wang! Please stamp this! I still have to deliver it to the Third Battalion," the messenger said, urging me impatiently after waiting for half an hour.
　　"Uh!" I slowly replied, my heart as anxious as ants on a hot pot. Of course, I couldn't refuse to stamp it, but if I stamped it casually, I wouldn't know what it said. If I asked someone else to read it, I was afraid of revealing secrets... The messenger stood beside me very respectfully, forcing me to sweat in the cold wind. My false pride was whipping me. How could I, a company commander, not be able to read an order?…
　　Finally, in anger and shame, I had to pretend to be calm, stamped the document, and sent the messenger away.
　　The desk clock ticked crisply and evenly, and around two o'clock, the instructor returned. I vaguely mentioned the "order" and quickly changed the subject to discussing how to tell each squad on sentry duty to be especially careful tonight, to saddle the horses, and for everyone to put on their clothes, ready to defend against enemy attacks at any time.
　　The stars were sparse, the sky was gray, it was dawn, and we were finally relieved. The comrades then went to bed one by one…
　　"Bang! Rumble!..." Gunshots rang out at the guard post in front. Two liaison sentries ran over, panting, and shouted, "The enemy is attacking from the west gully!..." Then, the third platoon's deputy also ran over. I asked him, "How many enemies are there?" He couldn't say for sure either.
　　I paused, and immediately ordered him, "Quickly take your platoon to resist!" But before the unit could leave the village, firing broke out in the east. I knew things were definitely going to be bad today. I discussed it with the instructor for a few words, and then, with my pistol in hand, ran straight to the east.
　　Da da da!... Ugh! The enemy's machine guns were closing in from the south. "Get on the roofs! Resist resolutely!" I waved my arm and was the first to climb onto the roof, took the machine gun from a soldier, aimed at the most crazed part of the enemy, and ka! ka... fired back four or five bursts.
　　"Comrades! Follow me! We..." The instructor, leading the Second Platoon, jumped off the several-zhang-high courtyard wall, wanting to seize the high ground of the mulberry forest in front. He had just shouted "First Platoon!" when a bullet flew over! He instantly fell on the roadside covered with green grass, seriously wounded…
　　"Fight resolutely! Avenge the instructor!" The soldiers shouted angrily, resisting stubbornly. To confuse the enemy's shooting, I also told the first platoon leader to lead his troops from the base of the wall to the high ground, running from roof to roof like the wind. Steel-like fighting spirit, angry roars, overwhelmed the enemy's arrogant aura...
　　Two soldiers and the third squad leader were wounded again, but the enemy's firepower in the east was indeed confused. I picked up my machine gun, ready to sweep again, when suddenly a bullet hit my right arm, and I fainted in a daze.
　　"Comrades! Charge! Charge!" When I woke up, all I could hear were the sounds of fighting. Watching as the enemy's ranks were thrown into disarray, wailing, and falling down in groups, the enemy collapsed…
　　More than half a month later, my injury improved, and the doctor agreed to let me go out for a walk. I strolled towards the regimental headquarters.
　　"Report!"
　　"Come in!" the regiment commander replied, but his tone was a little different than usual.
　　I hesitated and went in. The regiment commander offered me a stool and asked about my injuries in a friendly manner. But the chief of staff remained silent, making the atmosphere feel quite serious.
　　"Wang Yaoqin! We ordered your company to move overnight. You stamped it with your big red seal, so why didn't you execute it? You didn't send out proper reconnaissance, and you didn't execute the regimental headquarters' order. What is the reason?" The regiment commander put away his smile, his piercing eyes fixed on me.
　　At this moment, I suddenly realized and understood what the order that night had said. I stammered, unable to answer:
　　That night, the… the instructor was… wasn't there, and the clerk… had left… I… I didn't… didn't dare to ask anyone else to read it…
　　"Ha!…" the chief of staff let out a long sigh, turning his head to the side.
　　I haven't paid attention to studying, I have let down the Party, let down the people! Thoughts of regret were searing my mind, and suddenly, my whole body began to feel hot…
　　"Do you know how much loss you caused the revolution with this? More than a dozen comrades were wounded or killed!…"
　　"I… didn't study well, I have let down the revolution, let down the comrades!"
　　"Then, you must learn from these lessons in the future!" The regiment commander's expression became more gentle.
　　The chief of staff continued, "To be honest with you! If it weren't for your good counter-encirclement this time, if it weren't for your consistently resolute and brave fighting, and if this hadn't been an 'unintentional mistake,' you would have faced severe punishment!"
　　"Yes! Yes…" I listened, sweat dripping from my nose. Only now did I truly understand that not studying would lead to bloodshed!
　　"Comrade, go back! Remember, remember this lesson!" After the regiment commander repeatedly instructed me, I walked out in shame. I could no longer suppress my emotions, and I burst into tears. Originally, revolutionary soldiers shed blood, not tears, but I was too heartbroken. I had committed such a crime against the Party and the people, but the Party still forgave me. I can't forget the pain once the wound heals! I must be determined to study and improve my cultural level.

### 不学习害死人呵！

　　不学习害死人呵！
    柏桦
    你问我为什么要努力学习文化？提起来话长哩！远的不说，就以这次打归绥时我们单独活动的教训吧，团长亲自叮咛我：“你们连担任侦察警戒的那个方向最重要，你这次可要小心！要完不成任务，你就要负完全责任！”
    我当时一想：唔！我别的不会，打仗可是老本行；加上指导员政治文化都有一套，那还怕什么？！
    “对！一切有我负全责！”我挺有把握的答应了一声，就回驻地了。
    夜，静悄悄地，没有声音……时间，九点、十点、十一点、……流水似的过去，看样子今晚大概不会有什么敌情，我就安然的睡了。
    “报告！”团部通讯员张生贵的响亮的声音惊醒我，我强睁开迷糊的睡眼，接过他手里的“命令”，唤了一声指导员，没哼，周围一瞧，才知他出去查哨了。在摇幌的豆油灯光下，我认清确实是道“命令”，因为这两个字我看的次数太多了。
    我猜想着：不是什么敌情通报，就是注意警戒，准备拂晓出发。但我马上又想起：前次在驻防时，团部来通知，发给我们两挺轻机枪，九十枚手榴弹，可是我以为是会报，草草的画了一个“知”字，随即就跑到团部去了。参谋长在院子里走来走去，猛的一眼发现我就很严肃的问起我们为啥不领武器。我一听“牛头不对马嘴”，一顿子批评，只好哑吧吃黄莲——苦在心里。
    不识字的教训，又闪上我的脑子。脑子一热，更引起了往日的烦闷，我披上棉袄，到院里去遛＠……
    “王连长！请你盖个章吧！我还要到三营去传呢。”通讯员等了半个钟头有点不耐烦的催促着。
    “嗯！”我慢慢的应了一声，心里焦急得象热锅上的蚂蚁。不盖章当然不行，马马虎虎盖上吧，那可又不知道里边说的是怎么一回事情。叫别人去看看吧，又怕暴露秘密……通讯员十分恭敬的站在我的旁边，逼得我在冷风中直是冒热汗。虚伪的自尊心鞭打着我，我这连长怎么连命令也看不来？……
    最后在气忿、羞涩中，只好故作镇静地盖了一个章，算是打发着通讯员走了。
    桌上的马蹄表，清脆而均匀的响着，约莫下两点的光景，指导员回来了。我很含混的把刚才来“命令”的事情提了一下，就匆匆地把话题转到商量着：叫各班带哨的今晚要特别注意，马备上鞍子，人都要将衣服穿好，随时防备着敌人的袭击。
    星星稀落，天色灰白，是拂晓的时分，我们才算放下心，同志们也就一个一个爬上炕头睡着了。……
    “乒乓！轰隆隆！……”前边一排守卫的岔口上枪声在响了。两个联络哨跑得气喘喘的只喊了一声：“敌人从西边山沟里扑来了！………”接着，三排副也跑来了，我问他：“有多少敌人？”他也说不大清楚。
    我顿了顿，马上就吩咐他：“赶快将你们那个排带去抵抗！”那知队伍还未来得及出村口，东面也打响了。我知道，今天的事情一定糟了，与指导员商量了几句，提着驳壳枪就直往东边跑去。
    哒哒哒！……唔！南面敌人的机枪又围上来了“上房吧！坚决抵抗！”我挥着臂膀，第一个就爬到屋脊上，顺手接过战士的机枪，照准敌人最疯狂的地方，咯！咯……的就还给了他们四五索。
    “同志们！随我来！我们……”指导员带着第二排，从数丈高的院墙上跳了下去，想占住那前边桑树林的制高地。刚喊了一句“一排”！子弹飞来！他霎时倒在绿草丛丛的路边，负了重伤。……
    “坚决打呀！为指导员报仇！”战士们激愤地呐喊着，顽强的抵抗着，为了迷乱敌人的射击，我又叫一排长带领着队伍，从墙跟爬向高地，从这屋脊飞也似的跑向那个屋脊去。钢铁般的斗志，忿怒的吼声，压倒了敌人嚣张的气焰………
    两个战士与三班长又负伤了，但东边敌人的火力果然被迷乱了。我端起机枪正准备再扫一下，突的一颗子弹，打进我的右臂，我恍惚地昏过去。
    “同志们！冲呀！冲呀！”当我惊醒的时候，满耳尽是撕杀的喊声。眼看着敌人队伍大乱，哀叫着，成群的倒了下去，敌人溃散了……
    半个多月以后，我伤势好转起来，医生也答应让我出去散步。我信步向团部走去。
    “报告！”
    “进来！”团长答话，但口气和往日有点不同。
    我迟疑的进去了，团长递了一张凳子，稍稍的问了我一下伤势，还很亲切。但参谋长沉默着，使我感到这种空气相当严肃。
    “王尧琴！下命令叫你们连夜转移，你红朗朗的章子盖上，为什么就不执行呢？自己不好好派出侦察，又不执行团部命令；究竟是什么理由？”团长收起笑容，炯炯的眼睛盯着我。
    这时，我才恍然大悟，明白了那天夜里的命令说的什么，我口吃着，吞吞吐吐的答不上话来：
    那晚指……指导员不……不在，文书又……又出发了……我不……不敢叫别人看……
    “呵！……”参谋长侧着脸出了一口长气。
    我平日没有注意学习，对不起党，对不起人民！悔悟的念头，热辣辣地刺着我的脑子，顿时，周身都发起热来……。
    “你知道你这一下子对革命造成多大的损失吗？十几位同志伤的伤，亡的亡！……”
    “我……不好学习，我对不起革命，对不起同志们！”
    “那么，以后要好好接受这些教训！”团长的脸色已显得温和些了。
    参谋长接着说：“老实告诉你！如果不是你们这次反包围反的好，如果不是你作战一贯坚决、勇敢，这次又是‘无意之错’的话，那就非要受严重的处罚不行！”
    “是！是……”我听着、听着，汗珠直往鼻梁上冒，这一下才真的懂得了不学习要流血呵！
    “同志，回去吧！记住，记着这次教训！”团长再三叮嘱后，我惭愧地走了出来，我再压抑不住自己的感情，我狠狠地痛哭了一阵。本来革命军人是流血不流泪的，可是我太伤心了，我给党给人民造下了这样的罪恶，但，党还原谅了我，我不能好了疮疤忘了痛呵！一定要下决心学习，提高自己的文化水平。
