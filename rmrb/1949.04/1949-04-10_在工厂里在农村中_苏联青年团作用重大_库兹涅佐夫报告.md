　　In Factories and Rural Areas
  　The Soviet Komsomol Plays a Significant Role
  　Kuznetsov's Report
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 9th: The Soviet Komsomol is playing a huge role in both factories and rural areas. Kuznetsov, Chairman of the Central Committee of Soviet Trade Unions, pointed out in his report to the Komsomol Congress that young people account for more than one-third of the 90 million trade union members in the Soviet Union. In recent years, the Komsomol, together with the trade unions, has made great achievements in raising the political and cultural level of young workers. In the near future, every enterprise will have its own club or "Red Corner" (referring to places in Soviet factories where workers carry out amateur activities). The welfare of young workers is also valued. This summer, 2.5 million children of workers and staff will be able to spend their holidays in the trade union's summer camps. Kuznetsov said that the trade unions and the Komsomol have also stipulated the task of continuously developing sports throughout the country. In 1949, huge sums of money have been allocated to build, restore and equip sports fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and so on.
    At the same time, the Pravda newspaper said in an editorial: The Komsomol organization is also a great force in the countryside. In every collective farm, state farm, machine and tractor station in 54 states, border regions and republics, there are Komsomol organizations, with a total of 2.2 million members. Komsomol members in rural areas strive to improve their agricultural knowledge, actively participate in economic and political activities, initiate socialist competitions, and ensure strict compliance with the rules and regulations of collective farms. Komsomol members inspire young people and everyone in the countryside with their exemplary behavior. At the same time, Komsomol members are also often disseminators of culture in the countryside.

　　在工厂里在农村中
  　苏联青年团作用重大
  　库兹涅佐夫报告
    【新华社北平九日电】苏联共产主义青年团在工厂和农村中都起着巨大的作用。苏联职工会中委会主席库兹涅佐夫向共青团代表大会作报告时指出：在苏联九千万职工会会员当中，青年占三分之一以上。最近几年来，共青团和职工会一起，在提高青年工人政治文化水平方面，得到很大成就。在最近的将来，每一个企业都要有自己的俱乐部或“红角”（按即苏联工厂中工人们进行业余活动的地方）。青年工人的福利也受到重视。今年夏天将有二百五十万职工儿女可以到职工会的夏令营中过假期。库兹涅佐夫说：职工会和共青团又规定了在全国不断发展体育的任务。在一九四九年中已划出巨款来建筑、恢复和装备运动场、游泳池和体育馆等等。
    同时，真理报在一篇社论里说：共青团的组织在农村中也是巨大的力量。在五十四个州，边疆区和共和国的每一个集体农场、国营农场、机器和拖拉机站，都有团的组织，共有二百二十万团员。农村中的团员都努力提高农业知识、积极参加经济的和政治的活动，发起社会主义竞赛，并且保证严格地遵守集体农场的规则和章程。团员们用他们的模范行为，鼓舞着农村里的青年和每一个人。同时，团员们也经常是农村里文化的传播者。
