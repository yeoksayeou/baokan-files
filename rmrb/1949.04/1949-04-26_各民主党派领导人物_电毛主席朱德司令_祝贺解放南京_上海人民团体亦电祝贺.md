Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th: Leading figures of various democratic parties yesterday sent a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu congratulating the liberation of Nanjing. The telegram stated: “Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Field Armies of the People's Liberation Army: The People's Democratic Revolutionary War led by the Communist Party of China, with Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's profound strategy and decisive command, and the People's Liberation Army's commanders and fighters bravely rescuing the people and advancing without resistance, has won the hearts of the people and terrified the reactionaries. Yet the chief culprit, Chiang Kai-shek, still dares to be instigated by American imperialism, vainly attempting to prolong his dying breath through peace conspiracies. Chairman Mao, recognizing his treacherous intentions, still sympathized with the suffering of the people; offering leniency and allowing cooperation; the Eight Articles Agreement was fair and reasonable. Unexpectedly, Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary clique showed no remorse, their rebellious actions becoming more apparent, refusing to sign, and bringing more disaster to their compatriots. On the 21st of this month, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu ordered the field armies to advance and eliminate the reactionaries, a move that was met with joyful acclaim. With the force of a raging torrent, what is the Yangtze River? In less than three days, the pseudo-capital was captured. Judging from history, this is an unparalleled achievement. From now on, reaching Qiongyai in the south, the people will come to embrace us. Enemy troops who revolt will surely be welcomed by disarming soldiers. The establishment of a New China is imminent, and the realization of true peace is not far off. We extend our congratulations and wish you good health."

    【新华社北平二十五日电】各民主党派领导人物昨日致电毛主席朱总司令及人民解放军祝贺解放南京。电称：毛主席、朱总司令，人民解放军第一、二、三、四野战军全体指挥员战斗员：中国共产党领导之人民民主革命战争，由毛主席朱总司令老谋深算，指挥若定。人民解放军全体指挥员战斗员鼓勇救民，所向无前。人心悉归，反动夺魄。乃罪首蒋介石犹敢复受美帝国主义嗾使，冀以和平阴谋，妄图苟延残喘。毛主席既识诡怀，犹恤民苦；许以宽大，容之合作；八条协定，公允称情。不意蒋介石暨其反动集团，无心悔过，逆迹益彰，拒绝签字，重祸同胞。本月二十一日毛主席朱总司令命令各路野战军进灭反动，群情欣舞。投鞭断流，何有天堑？未及三朝，伪都即破。征诸自古，无比丰功。自此南届琼崖，人民将来奔于怀抱。敌军反正，将士定解甲以欢迎。新中国之建立在即，真和平之实现匪遥。敬致贺忱，并祝康健。
