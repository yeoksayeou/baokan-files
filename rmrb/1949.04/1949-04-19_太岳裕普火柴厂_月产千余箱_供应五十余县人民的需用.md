　　Taiyue Yu Pu Match Factory
  　Monthly Production Exceeds One Thousand Boxes
  　Supplying the Needs of People in Over Fifty Counties
    [Taiyue Electric] The Taiyue Yu Jin Match Factory, through two years of active construction, has gradually improved in both quantity and quality, selling its products in over fifty counties. The factory started production in December 1947. At that time, due to limitations in materials, technology, and other aspects, the products and packaging were not very good. The matches were prone to "exploding" (making a loud noise when struck, not easily igniting), and even though only ten boxes were produced per day, they were difficult to sell. Later, after research by all the factory staff, the "exploding" problem was overcome and the packaging was improved. By May 1948, the factory gradually occupied the market. In particular, the phosphorus sulfide and "Qisi Feng" matches were very popular among the people of Southern Shanxi. After May of last year, demand exceeded supply, and orders came from all over. Over the past year, due to improved technology, supplementary tools, and gradual improvements in materials, production has greatly increased: In February, March, and April of last year, the average monthly production was over 160 boxes, May produced 363 boxes, June 522 boxes, and by December, it produced 688 boxes. This January, it produced 1,018 boxes. Currently, the matches are supplied to over fifty counties with a population of five million, requiring an estimated 1,400 boxes of matches per month. The factory's highest output in January was 1,018 boxes, still short by 382 boxes. The factory must strive to increase production this year to meet the demand.

　　太岳裕普火柴厂
  　月产千余箱
  　供应五十余县人民的需用
    【太岳电】太岳裕晋火柴厂，经两年来的积极建设，在数量质量上均逐渐提高，行销五十余县。该厂于一九四七年十二月开工，当时因材料、技术等各方面的限制，出品与包装均不甚好，火柴多易“放炮”（划时奇响，不易着），每天虽只出十箱，也卖不了。后经全厂职工研究，克服了“放炮”毛病，改善了包装，到一九四八年五月，才逐渐占领了市场。尤以硫化磷与“气死风”火柴最受晋南人民欢迎。去年五月以后，就已形成供不应求，各地纷纷来信订购。一年来由于技术提高，工具补充与材料逐渐改进，因而产量大增：去年二、三、四月，每月平均产一百六十多箱，五月产三百六十三箱，六月五百二十二箱，到十二月即产六百八十八箱，今年一月产一千零十八箱。现火柴供应五十余县，人口五百万，计每月需火柴一千四百箱，该厂一月份最高出到一千零十八箱，尚不足三百八十二箱。该厂今年仍要努力提高产量，始能供应。
