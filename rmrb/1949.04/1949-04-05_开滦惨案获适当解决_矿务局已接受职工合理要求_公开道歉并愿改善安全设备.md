　　The Kailuan Colliery Tragedy Appropriately Resolved

　　Mining Bureau Accepts Workers' Reasonable Demands, Publicly Apologizes, and is Willing to Improve Safety Equipment

　　[Reported by this newspaper] Due to the Kailuan Tangshan Mine's management only focusing on making money and disregarding the lives of workers, resulting in a series of tragedies, the Tangshan Mine Workers' Temporary Representative Conference submitted a letter of protest to the Mining Bureau on March 29, putting forward four reasonable demands. However, the mine authorities ignored these demands and remained indifferent until 10:00 AM on March 30. The Presidium of the Workers' Representative Conference believed that the mine's delaying tactics, which disregarded the workers' organizations and the safety of workers, could not be tolerated. They immediately issued an emergency notice, convening an emergency meeting of the Workers' Temporary Representative Conference at the Intermediate Staff Club at 3:00 PM. Comrade Zhao Qian, from the Presidium, reported on the protest process and the mine's delaying attitude. After discussion, the conference passed a resolution to give the mine authorities fifteen minutes to express their attitude; otherwise, they would file a lawsuit with the People's Court, accusing the mine authorities of violating mine safety regulations and neglecting workers' lives. The Presidium immediately sent representatives to notify the mine authorities. Within about ten minutes, they received two letters. One letter, written by all the engineers, explained that the mine authorities were shifting responsibility onto them, causing them to have doubts and misunderstandings about the Workers' Representative Conference. In the spirit of worker solidarity, the entire Workers' Representative Conference decided to send three representatives to invite all the engineers to attend the conference, using the facts of the conference to dispel their doubts. The other letter was the mine's response to the four conditions, the content of which was vague and unclear. The entire Workers' Representative Conference recognized that this response was clearly a delaying tactic by the mine authorities and immediately decided to call on the mine authorities to send representatives to state their attitude on the spot.

　　Under the strong force of worker solidarity, the mine authorities had to send Director Wei Zhun to answer in person. After Wei entered, worker representatives raised questions one after another. At this time, all the engineers entered the venue, and the worker representatives welcomed them with thunderous applause, shouting, "Workers unite!" Finally, the worker representatives put forward three conditions: (1) The Workers' Temporary Representative Conference will organize a mine safety investigation committee to conduct a detailed and thorough investigation and registration of all safety facilities above and below ground in all mines, and put forward improvement suggestions. The mine authorities should guarantee the implementation of these suggestions. (2) Guarantee that in the future, any matters for which the mine authorities should be responsible will not be arbitrarily shirked or used to sow discord among workers. (3) The mine authorities should publish a statement in the newspaper regarding the causes and responsibilities of today's incident, publicly admitting their mistakes and apologizing, and submit the draft to the Workers' Preparatory Committee for review within 24 hours. The mine authorities must distribute that issue of the newspaper to each worker representative and injured worker. Under the united power of all worker representatives and engineers, Wei Zhun accepted all three conditions.

　　Subsequently, Comrade Liu Ruqing, representing the Military Control Commission, addressed all worker representatives, explaining that the truth of the workers had won. These conditions still need to be put into practice, and everyone should urge the mine authorities to implement them, strengthen worker solidarity, and the Military Control Commission will resolutely support them. The Tangshan City Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee also expressed its firm support for the workers.

　　On March 31, Wei Zhun, Director of the Tangshan Mining Bureau of Kailuan, published an apology to the workers in the newspaper, stating that he would now urgently seek to ensure the safety of equipment, recognize the Workers' Safety Committee, and accept its recommendations.

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The person in charge of the Tangshan Military Control Commission issued the following statement regarding the Tangshan mine tragedy: "Recently, the unfortunate incidents of workers being injured by fumes have occurred continuously in the Kailuan Tangshan Coal Mine, which is caused by the irresponsible attitude of the Kailuan Mining Bureau towards safety equipment. The Military Control Commission is extremely concerned about the injured workers. In addition to sending personnel to express condolences, it has also instructed the military representatives stationed at the Tangshan Mine to warn the mine authorities to pay attention to the safety of workers' lives and prevent such incidents from happening again in the future. At the same time, the mine authorities have responded to the workers' demands and are willing to implement conditions such as improving safety equipment and providing compensation for injuries and deaths."

　　开滦惨案获适当解决
    矿务局已接受职工合理要求　公开道歉并愿改善安全设备
    【本报讯】开滦唐山矿因资方只图赚钱，不顾工人死活，因此连出惨案后，唐山矿职工临时代表会在三月二十九日向矿务局递交抗议书，提出四项合理要求。可是直到三月三十日上午十时矿方还置之不理，不表示任何态度。职工代表大会的主席团认为矿方这种小看职工团体、漠视职工安全的拖延态度，是决不能容忍的，马上发出紧急通告，下午三时在中级员司俱乐部召开职工临时代表会紧急会议，由主席团赵谦同志报告抗议经过，和矿方的拖延态度，经过讨论，大会通过限矿方在十五分钟里表明态度，否则，即向人民法院起诉，控告矿方违犯矿厂安全规章，玩忽职工生命的不法行为。主席团即派代表通知矿方，随于十分钟左右，收到两封信。一封是全体工程师所写，说明由于矿方把责任推在他们身上，使他们对职工代表会，产生了怀疑和误解。全体职工代表本着职工团结的精神，通过派三个代表，邀请全体工程师来参加大会，用大会的事实来解除他们的怀疑。另一封是矿方答复四个条件的信件，内容含混不清。全体职工代表认清这种答复明明是矿方推延，当即通过叫矿方马上派代表来当场表明态度。
    在职工团结的坚强力量下，矿方不得不由主管魏肫当面作答：魏入场后，职工代表纷纷提出质问。这时全体工程师入场，职工代表以雷动的掌声欢迎他们，并高呼：“职工团结起来！”最后职工代表提出三项条件：（一）职工临时代表会组织矿厂安全调查委员会，对所有矿厂井上井下一切安全设施进行详细周密的调查登记，并提出改善意见，矿方对这意见应该保证执行。（二）保证今后凡是有关矿方应负责任的事，不得随便推卸，离间职工团结。（三）今日事件的因果责任，矿方应该登报声明，公开认错道歉，并限在二十四小时内将稿件送到职工筹委会审核。该期报纸矿方须分发给全体职工代表和受伤工友每人一份。以上三个条件在全体职工代表和工程师的团结力量之下，魏肫都已接受。
    随后由刘儒卿同志代表军管会向全体职工代表讲话，说明职工的真理得到了胜利。这些条件尚待实践，大家应该督促矿方执行，加强职工团结，军管会决以全力支援，唐山市职工总会筹委会也表示坚决支持职工。
    三月三十一日唐山矿务局矿区主管魏肫登报向工友道歉，表示今后当亟谋设备安全，承认职工安全委员会，并接受其建议。
    【本报讯】唐市军管会负责人对唐山矿惨案发表谈话如下：“近来开滦唐山煤矿，连续发生薰伤职工人员的不幸事件，是开滦矿务局对安全设备不负责任的态度所造成。本会对受伤职工极为关怀，除已派员进行慰问外，并已训令驻唐山矿军事代表，警告矿方注意职工生命安全，今后应切实防止此类事件发生，同时矿方已经答复职工要求，愿改善安全设备，抚恤伤亡等条件的执行。”
