[Report from Central Hebei] The Anxin County Party Committee convened a meeting of key cadres in charge of canals on March 16th. According to inspections, the following achievements have been made in water conservancy work: (1) Two old trunk canals have been repaired, totaling 23 li in length; one new canal has been opened, with a length of 4.5 li; six old branch canals have been repaired, totaling 42 li in length; in addition, many small branch canals have been opened, capable of irrigating 18,000 mu of land. Seven bridges have also been constructed across the canals. (2) Forty-three canal opening committees have been established and improved, and 25 villages are in the process of establishing them, laying the foundation for grassroots canal management organizations. (3) Initial experience has been gained in managing canals and directing water flow. After the ditches are dug, water should be released first to test the water volume and the elevation of the terrain, and then repairs should be made. Secondly, when using water, high-lying land should be irrigated first, followed by low-lying land, and the order of irrigation should be determined according to the water volume. However, there are still some shortcomings in the work that urgently need to be improved: (1) Specific methods for using water still need to be studied in detail, and efforts should be gradually made to ensure the supply of water for irrigation. (2) A systematic organization for canal management and water release should be established on the basis of existing organizations to overcome certain chaotic phenomena. In addition, a special canal management organization should be established to solve problems such as the burden of opening canals.

　　Editor's note: Anxin County has both rivers running vertically and horizontally, and Baiyangdian, a living reservoir with the most valuable water storage for irrigating farmland. Based on this favorable natural condition, the Anxin County Party Committee proposed that opening and repairing new canals on the basis of existing canals is a central issue in increasing production. On the 27th day of the twelfth lunar month of last year, Anxin convened a water conservancy meeting to carry out this work.

　　安新修渠七十里
  　渠道管理须加强
    【冀中讯】安新县委于三月十六日召开掌握渠道的主要干部会议，据检查，目前水利工作已作出如下成绩：（一）修整旧渠干两道，长二十三里；新开渠一道，长四里半，修理旧支渠六道，长四十二里；还开出很多小的支渠，可浇地一万八千亩。并建设过路桥七座。（二）建立与健全了四十三个开渠委员会，正在建立者有二十五个村，打下了渠道管理基层组织基础。（三）初步得到了管理渠道与领导放水的经验。沟挖好后，要先放水试测水量及地势高低，然后再修理。其次，使水时，先浇高地后浇洼地，按照水量情况规定浇地顺序。但工作中仍存在一些缺点，急待改进：（一）使水办法尚需具体研究，应逐渐作到保证浇地水量的供给。（二）应在现有组织基础上建立渠道管理及放水的系统组织，以克服某些混乱现象。并建立渠道专管组织，解决开渠负担等问题。
    按：安新县既有河流纵横贯串，又有灌溉农田最有价值的活储水库白洋淀。根据此种有利的自然条件，安新县委提出：在旧有渠道基础上开修新渠，是提高生产的中心问题。去年阴历十二月二十七日，安新即召开了水利会议，进行这一工作。
