　　North China Iron and Steel Company Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
  　First Furnace of Metallurgical Coke Produced
    [Reported by This Newspaper] The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant of North China Iron and Steel Company successfully produced its first furnace of metallurgical coke at 3:30 PM on April 21st, ahead of schedule. This is the glorious result of the diligent efforts of the plant's workers over the past few months. Going forward, all departments of the coking plant, including the coal washing plant, byproduct plant, light oil plant, and tar plant, can fully commence production, allowing the iron and steel plant to enter a new stage in its recovery of production. On the day of coke production, the 21st, the workers held a grand celebration on the platform in front of the coke oven. Comrade Xu Daben, Deputy Minister of the Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government, personally attended and presided over the coke production ribbon-cutting ceremony. Worker representatives reported on the process and achievements of coke production on the spot, and the workers also performed their own songs and plays, celebrating that this coke oven, built with the blood and sweat of the Chinese people by Japanese imperialists and plundered by Kuomintang bureaucrat-compradors for three years, would henceforth serve the construction of a new democratic China's heavy industry. When the first furnace of red-hot coke was pushed out of the coking chamber, the workers applauded enthusiastically and shouted, "Work hard to produce and support the front line!"
    This coke production was from the second group of the No. 1 Solvay waste heat coke oven (a total of one hundred ovens, divided into four groups, twenty-five in each group), which was moved from Japan by Japanese imperialists in February 1942. After the Kuomintang bandits took over, production was intermittent due to a lack of raw materials. The coke produced was not used for ironmaking, but mostly sold for profit. Near liberation, the furnace was shut down due to the interruption of raw material supply. After liberation, active recovery began on January 25th. Workers studied together and worked hard to overcome material difficulties. Without special bricks, ordinary fire bricks were used for modification, and the furnace was completed four days ahead of schedule on February 21st. During the furnace heating period, the workers were very careful, so no minor problems occurred during the dangerous period from 160 degrees Celsius to 360 degrees Celsius. After the dangerous period, the temperature rose rapidly. In the last few days, the workers guarded the furnace, which was over 1000 degrees, day and night to prevent the temperature from dropping. On the day of coal loading, the 20th, engineers, staff, and workers each worked an average of sixteen hours, which advanced the furnace heating by ten days (taking only fifty days), which is more than thirty days ahead of the Kuomintang era. The labor used for furnace heating was also only 3,221 workdays, which is one-third less than the Kuomintang era. More material resources were saved. In the Kuomintang era, more than 840 tons of coal were burned, but this time only 400 tons were burned, saving more than 50 percent. These glorious achievements are the specific manifestation of the workers' united and master-of-their-own-house spirit after liberation, after learning and realizing that they are now working for themselves and for the people.　　　　　　(Chi)

　　华北钢铁公司石景山钢铁厂
  　第一炉冶金焦炭出炉
    【本报讯】华北钢铁公司石景山钢铁厂于四月二十一日下午三时半提前推出第一炉冶金焦炭，这是该厂职工数月来辛勤努力的光辉结果。今后炼焦厂所属洗煤场、副产场、轻油场、焦油场各部门即可全部开工生产，使钢铁厂在恢复生产过程中步入一新阶段。廿一日出焦那天，职工们在炼焦炉前的平台上举行了隆重的庆祝会，华北人民政府企业部副部长徐达本同志亲自出席主持出焦剪采典礼。职工代表们当场报告了出焦的经过与成绩，工友们还演出了自己的歌和剧，庆祝这一座日本帝国主义者剥削中国人民血汗所建造，而又经国民党官僚买办三年掠夺的炼焦炉从此为建设新民主主义的中国重工业而服务。当第一炉火红的焦炭推出焦化室时，职工们一齐热烈鼓掌，并高呼“努力生产，支援前线”。
    这次出焦的是第一号索尔维废热式炼焦炉的第二组（共一百只，分四组，每组二十五只），是日本帝国主义在一九四二年二月由其本土迁来。国民党匪帮接收后因为没有原料，时开时停。炼了焦炭也不是作炼铁用的，大半是卖了钱中饱了。快解放时因原料来源断绝而停炉，解放后，在一月二十五日就开始积极恢复，职工们互相研究，努力克服材料困难，没有特型砖，就用普通火砖改造，终于提前四天在二月二十一日完成。在温炉期间，职工们十分小心，所以在摄氏一六○度升到三六○度的危险期没有出过一点小毛病。过了危险期，温度即迅速上升。在最后几天里，职工们日夜看守在千度以上的炉旁，防止温度下降。二十日装煤的那天，工程师职员和工友们每人平均工作了十六小时，这样使温炉提早十天完成（只花了五十天），与国民党时代相比，则要提前三十多天。温炉所用的人力也只用了三二二一工，比国民党时代节省了三分之一。物力节省更多，国民党时代要烧煤八百四十多吨，这回只烧了四百吨，节省了百分之五十多。这些光辉的成绩都是职工们在解放后经过学习认识到现在已是为自己，为人民干活，团结一致，当家作主的具体表现。　　　　　　（炽）
