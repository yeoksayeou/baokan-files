Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, 22nd: The mighty People's Liberation Army continued to cross the Yangtze River in full force from west of Guichi to Madang at 5:00 PM on the 21st. By the morning of the 22nd, nine entire divisions had crossed the Yangtze River and reached the south bank, occupying positions near Wushazha, west of Guichi, and near Huangshiji, north of Dongliu. Another army of the People's Liberation Army occupied Bapao Island in the middle of the river, west of Madang. Currently, the hundreds of miles of the Yangtze River surface between Wuhu and Madang are teeming with tens of thousands of boats shuttling back and forth between the north and south banks. Various units of the People's Liberation Army are continuing to cross the Yangtze River in large numbers. The People's Liberation Army, which has arrived on the south bank, has only encountered very weak resistance so far. They are continuing to expand their positions on the south bank and are fiercely advancing deep inland.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, 22nd: The People's Liberation Army on the opposite bank of Nanjing recently launched a fierce attack on the Pukou area. Jiangpu County, southwest of Pukou, was captured on the morning of the 21st.

Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 22nd: The Nationalist Navy vessels, on which Chiang Kai-shek's diehards dreamed of relying to defend the Yangtze River, have been sunk and damaged by the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army by eighteen vessels. The names of six vessels have been identified: gunboats "Andong," "Chuguan," "Yongji," "Yongxiang," "Yinghao," and destroyer "Yingkou."

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 21st: The People's Liberation Army, which is about to cross the Yangtze River, has controlled the north bank of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and captured many small islands in the river, gaining favorable springboards for crossing the river. In the four days from the 8th to the 11th, the People's Liberation Army captured the county towns of Guangji and Huangmei in Hubei Province, Yongjia Town on the outskirts of Yuxikou, opposite Wuhu, Anhui Province, Erba, Zhonglu Matou, Wujimiao, Qiaomatou southwest of Wuwei, Dahekou southwest of Yizheng, Jiangsu Province, Sanwenhe, Shijiaqiao, Balipu, Chenjiaxiang, Zhujiaba on the north bank of Zhenjiang, and Sanjiangying northwest of Yangzhou, among other strongholds. In total, more than four entire battalions and four entire companies of the enemy were annihilated, and more than 1,400 enemy soldiers were captured. Currently, only ten independent bridgehead strongholds remain for the Kuomintang bandit army on the north bank of the Yangtze River from Yuxikou to the estuary: Guaiba south of Yuxikou and Xiliangshan north of it, Jinhekou east of Hexian, Pukou, Huazikou southeast of Luhe, Shierxu, Guazhou, Liuxu south of Yangzhou, and Baxu south of Jingjiang. The islands in the river occupied by the People's Liberation Army include Tiebanzhou, Tongbanzhou, and @banzhou northeast of Anqing, Taiyangzhou south of Wuwei, Xinzhou and Laozhou northeast of Zhenjiang, and Yongan Island east of Yangzhou. During the capture of islands such as Tiebanzhou, the People's Liberation Army's assault boats crossed the 700-meter-long river surface in just seven minutes and occupied the enemy's forward fortifications. After the People's Liberation Army captured Xinzhou and Laozhou, on the 13th, the enemy's 54th Army concentrated two regiments and one security regiment, with the support of eight bandit vessels and six aircraft, to launch a large-scale counterattack. They were severely beaten by the People's Liberation Army, and the entire enemy security regiment was annihilated, killing and capturing more than a thousand enemy soldiers, with the remaining enemy retreating in defeat. The Kuomintang bandit army's naval vessels patrolling the Yangtze River are now extremely difficult to operate under the powerful artillery blockade of the People's Liberation Army along the north bank of the Yangtze River. In the vicinity of Anqing alone, five enemy vessels were damaged or sunk by the People's Liberation Army between the 29th of last month and the 2nd of this month.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 21st: The People's Liberation Army liberated Yunmeng County, west of the Pinghan Railway on the outskirts of Hankou, on the 8th, and the defending enemy fled south.
