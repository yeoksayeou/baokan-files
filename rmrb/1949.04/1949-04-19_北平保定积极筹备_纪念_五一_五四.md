Various organs have established sub-committees. The preparatory sub-committee of the district party committee plans to launch a campaign to improve work efficiency before the arrival of "May 1st". Some sub-committees of state-owned factories have proposed, in addition to carrying out production competitions, to universally carry out recollection movements to improve awareness. In the production movement in private factories, the focus is on adjusting wages, strengthening worker learning, and improving class consciousness. Among cadres in various organs, adhering to the work system, strengthening organizational discipline, and improving work efficiency are emphasized. School students should study hard. Efforts should be made to achieve results in this movement, so that work and study can be improved a step further.

    【冀中电】冀中区和保定市联合纪念“五一”、“五四”总筹备委员会已正式成立。四月九日，冀中总工会、青联会，假保市民众教育馆召集冀中和本市各机关团体、学校、国营工厂、部队等廿六个单位，三十七名代表开会商讨纪念“五一”、“五四”的筹备工作。各机关纷纷成立分会。区党委机关筹备分会计划在“五一”节到来以前，要开展提高工作效率运动。各公营工厂分会，有的提出除了开展生产竞赛外，要普遍的开展回忆运动，借以提高觉悟。在私营工厂生产运动中，着重调整工资，加强工人学习，提高阶级觉悟。在各机关干部中坚持工作制度，加强组织纪律性，提高工作效率。学校学生要努力学习。并要在这一运动中做出成绩，使工作学习提高一步。
