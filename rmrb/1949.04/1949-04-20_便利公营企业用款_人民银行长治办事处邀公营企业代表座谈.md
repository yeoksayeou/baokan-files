　　Facilitating the Use of Funds for Public Enterprises
　　The People's Bank of China's Changzhi Office Invites Representatives of Public Enterprises to a Symposium

　　[Taihang News] After strengthening its study, the People's Bank of China's Changzhi Office further realized that in the past there were many errors that did not conform to the Party's policies, such as being willing to issue commercial loans but unwilling to issue industrial loans; the understanding that the bank's main service target was state-owned enterprises was not clear, and there were still some bureaucratic styles. For this reason, it specially invited responsible comrades from 13 units including the city's state-owned factories and the Daxing Freight Station to hold a symposium. At the meeting, the bank first made a self-criticism, saying: "In the past year, we have taken the one-sided path of relying on poor peasants and blindly developing industry and commerce, and there has been a bureaucratic style of 'sitting at home and waiting for customers to come to our door.' The concept of serving state-owned enterprises is not clear..." Representatives from various public enterprises first made self-criticisms and put forward opinions to the bank. A representative from Xinhua Bookstore said: "The bank closes too early at 4:00 PM." A representative from Yongxing Purchasing Station said: "Once we sent a batch of small change, and it took several days to count it, and it was short more than 3,000 yuan (RMB), and we could not reimburse it. The relationship between us is not very close. In the future, we will keep the money at home and will not deposit it in the bank again. At the same time, we have to find a guarantor when we use the money. Are we not as good as private businesses? Our loans are often three or four million, and we don’t know when the interest rate goes up. We should be notified in the future." A representative from the Third Administrative Office Distillery Management Office said: "It takes a lot of time to make a payment. We request that it is best to transfer funds from various places." Other units put forward similar opinions. The bank stated that it would definitely provide convenience for everyone to deposit and withdraw money in the future, and proactively proposed that it would be willing to act as an agent for the collection and payment of funds for various public enterprises in the future, which was welcomed by everyone. After the meeting, it specifically discussed methods such as collection and payment on behalf, delivery on behalf, and transfer and remittance with six factories including Daxing Freight Station, Water Company, and Electric Light Company, and determined that the bank's main service target in the future would be state-owned enterprises. Finally, the meeting adjourned in a sincere and harmonious atmosphere.

　　便利公营企业用款
  　人民银行长治办事处邀公营企业代表座谈
    【太行讯】人民银行长治办事处加强学习后，进一步认识到过去有很多不符合党的政策的错误，如愿放商贷不愿放工贷；对银行主要服务对象是国营企业的认识不明确，以及尚存有某些官僚主义作风等。为此，特邀请该市国营各工厂、大兴货栈等十三个单位的负责同志举行座谈。会上该行首先自我批评说：“一年来我们曾走过片面的贫雇路线和盲目发展工商业的左右偏向，并存在着‘开门家中坐，单等顾客来’的官僚主义作风，对为国营企业服务的观念不明确…”各公营企业代表均首先作了自我检讨，并对银行提出意见。新华书店代表说：“银行下午四点钟下班太早。”永兴采购站代表说：“有一次我们送来了一部零款，放了几天才点出来，并短了三千多元（人民币），我们也无法报销。彼此关系很不密切，以后我们有款就放在家里，不愿再存银行了。同时，我们用款还得找保，难道我们还不如私人商号？我们贷款常是三、四百万，利息涨了我们也不知道，今后应先通知。”三专署酒坊管理处代表说：“交一次款耽误时间很大，我们要求最好能从各地拨转。”其他各单位都提出大同小异的意见，该行表示今后一定给予大家存取方便，并主动提出今后愿给各公营企业代理款项收付，大家均表欢迎。会后即与大兴货栈、自来水公司、电灯公司等六厂具体商洽了代收代付、代取代送、转拨汇兑等办法，并确定银行今后主要服务对象是国营企业。最后，在诚恳和谐的气氛中散会。
