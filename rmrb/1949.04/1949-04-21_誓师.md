　　Swearing-in Ceremony

　　Central Plains Dispatch from Our Newspaper

　　It was during the first joyful March for the people of Luohe when our corps held a swearing-in ceremony for crossing the Yangtze River and advancing south. At 3:00 PM on the 8th, thousands of people crowded into the square west of the village. Amidst the excited and joyful applause, Commander Liu said decisively, "Now we are going to cross the river, and we will create even greater glory in this last and greatest war in Chinese history!" Thus, under the call of the Party, everyone in the unit became tense in thought and action.

　　Old soldiers were vying to say, "I want to hang two medals. I got one in the Huaihai Campaign, and I want to earn another in the Yangtze River Crossing Operation." But another said, "I want to win an award at the national general liberation heroes' conference." They also carefully counted their scars: those left in the War of Resistance Against Japan, those pierced by the bullets of the Chiang bandits and American imperialists. They shouted, "Don't forget these old hatreds, and don't let a single enemy escape, leaving future troubles for the people!" Cadres spent the whole day studying the route to the south and the work after reaching the south. They worked day and night. Many people discussed work even while eating; some had already squeezed out time to take apart quilts, reduce luggage, wash clothes, pack shoes, and make dry rations...

　　The people of the Central Plains were also boiling with enthusiasm for crossing the Yangtze River. Once, I saw a little girl walk onto the stage, and she said: "My name is Meng Xiuzhi, a student at Yancheng Middle School. I wanted to join the army a long time ago, but I didn't tell anyone. One day, I heard my older brother and sister discussing: 'I'll join the army, you stay! Our father is over sixty and has worked his whole life. You stay home and take care of him!' The sister said: 'It's better for you to stay.' They went to find their father, and the father said: 'Good children, you all go. Fighting old Chiang is the best thing possible; I can take care of myself.' After a while, he saw me, and he said: 'Xiuzhi, don't you dare say something big? Go with your older brother and sister?' I glared at him, and I said: 'I've been thinking about it for a long time, I just didn't tell you yet!'" The little girl concluded: "I have no worries at all, I am determined to cross the Yangtze River!" The three siblings joined the army in this way. Another story is about the principal of Luoyang No. 1 Middle School and his son, Cheng Dai, both vying to join the army. In the end, the son ran ahead and joined first. Although elementary school teacher Yan Fang was from Hebei, he settled his wife in the school and also joined the army. Once, in front of four hundred people, he bit his finger and wrote a blood letter, saying excitedly, "I will never return until the whole country is victorious; my family is suffering, but it can be improved slowly. Now there are tens of millions of families in the country who are living a life worse than that of oxen and horses in my family!"

　　The people and troops of the Central Plains are welcoming the Yangtze River crossing operation in this way. At the swearing-in ceremony, everyone raised their hands, raised their guns, and raised their flags, in front of the smiling portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, forcefully making the following oath:

　　By this time, night had already come, and the stars shone on this forest of arms. These thousands of steel arms are the arms that will write a new era for the people of Jiangnan in history.

　　誓师
    苏策
    本报中原通讯
    正是漯河人民过着第一个欢快的三月的时候，我们某兵团召开渡江南进的誓师大会了。八日下午三点钟，几千人就拥挤在寨西边的广场上，在兴奋欢快的掌声中，刘司令员斩钉截铁的说：“现在我们要过江，我们要在这中国历史上最后最大的战争中，创造更大的光荣！”就这样，在党的号召下，部队每个人都从思想上、行动上紧张起来。
    老战士们在争着说：“我要挂两个牌牌，这回淮海战役挂了一个，要在渡江作战中，再争取一个。”但另一个说：“我还要多得一个全国总解放后，英雄大会上的奖章。”他们还经心地数着自己的创伤：那些是在抗日战争中留下的，那些是蒋匪美国子弹打穿的，他们嚷着：“不要忘了这些前仇，更不要放跑一个敌人，给人民留下后祸！”干部们要用整天的时间去研究到江南的路上，和打到江南以后的工作。他们日夜不睡的工作着。有许多人在吃饭时也谈论着工作；有些人已经挤出时间来，从事拆棉被、减行装、洗衣服、收拾鞋子、作干粮………
    中原的人民也为打过长江而沸腾了，有一次我看见一个小姑娘走上台子，她讲：我叫孟秀芝，郾城中学的学生，我是老早就想参军了，可是，我没有对别人说。有一天，我听见哥哥和姐姐在议论着：“我去参军去，你留下吧！咱爹六十多了，做了一辈子工，你在家招呼他吧！”姐姐说：“还是你留下好”他们去找父亲了，父亲说：“好孩子，你们都去吧，打老蒋是再好没有的事，我可以自己招呼自己。”一会他看见我了，他说：“秀芝，你就不敢说句大话吗？和你哥哥姐姐一块去？”我瞪了他一眼，我说：“我早就想了，还没告你哩！”小姑娘最后说：“我一点顾虑没有，坚决打过长江去！”兄妹三人就这样参军了。另一个故事，是洛阳一中的校长和他儿子程岱，两个争着军来参军，最后，儿子抢先跑了来。小学教员晏方虽是河北人，可是他把妻子安置在学校里，也参军了。有一次，他在四百人面前，把指头咬破，写下血书，激动的说：“在全国没有胜利时，我决不回来；我的家庭是苦的，但可以慢慢改善，现在全国还有几千万个家庭，在过着还不如在家庭的牛马生活！”
    中原的人民和部队就是这样的迎接着过江行动。在誓师大会上大家举着手、举着枪、举着旗帜，在微笑的毛主席与朱总司令的像前，用力的宣着这样的誓言：
    这时，夜已经来了，繁星照耀着这手臂的森林，这几千条钢铁的手臂，就是即将在历史上写下江南人民新时代的手臂。
