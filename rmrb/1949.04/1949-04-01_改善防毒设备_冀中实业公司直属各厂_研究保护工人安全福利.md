　　Jizhong Industrial Company's Directly Subordinate Factories Study Protecting Worker Safety and Welfare
    [Jizhong Electric] Over the past year, Jizhong Industrial Company's directly subordinate factories have achieved preliminary results in developing worker welfare initiatives. The Worker Welfare Committee has collected over 80,000 yuan in insurance funds and cultural fees, and has organized six condolence payments, disbursing 2,000 jin of millet. Botou Yonghua Match Company has established an outdoor workers' kitchen, eliminating the phenomenon of workers getting sick from eating cold food. Baoding Power Plant and Iron Factory have established employee cooperatives to provide workers and their families with consumer goods; they also operate an electrically powered flour mill, earning 1,000 yuan per day. Employees can buy flour for one yuan per jin below the market price. In order to support the development of worker welfare specialties, the Chemical Factory transferred the battery factory it operated to the workers for 200,000 yuan accumulated from their wages. At the end of the year, the account showed a profit of six times the original capital. In addition, six factories have established worker spare-time schools, with 607 participants. Four factories, including the Match and Chemical Factories, have established worker clubs. However, there are still serious shortcomings in the worker welfare work of each factory: (1) Worker cooperatives are not universally organized, and those that have been organized still have a purely profit-making perspective. The Match Factory's worker consumer cooperative has turned to commerce in order to achieve profit-making goals. Wanjv Leather Factory used worker welfare funds to hoard wheat. The Julong Iron Factory cooperative, because it does not allocate daily necessities according to the number of worker family members, had its goods snatched up when prices fluctuated, and some people even resold items bought from the cooperative. (2) Insurance equipment is still poor. The Chemical Factory has had one death as a result and another worker scalded. The Match Factory's pharmacy and packaging divisions, the Chemical Factory's tri-acid division, and the Leather Factory's leather shaft division all involve a large amount of toxins in the manufacturing process, but the factories have not paid sufficient attention to and improved anti-poison equipment. (3) The Match Factory still retains the habits of old capitalists, and packaging female workers with ten years of service do not receive wages for holidays, and the so-called "theft will result in dismissal" clause is emphasized. Based on the above review, the Industrial Company's Worker Welfare Committee has stipulated "Trial Implementation Measures for Labor Insurance," which specifies specific measures for handling work-related injuries, disabilities, deaths, and maternity for female workers. Each factory will also set up sickbay rest rooms and outdoor worker rest rooms. Employee medical expenses can be contributed to public or private hospitals to facilitate employees to treat diseases at any time. Where possible, factories can set up or jointly establish health clinics or dispensaries. It will also seize the organization of worker cooperatives. According to the needs of each factory, strengthen insurance equipment and anti-poison equipment.

   　冀中实业公司直属各厂  研究保护工人安全福利
    【冀中电】冀中实业公司直属各厂，一年来，在兴办工人福利事业方面，已初具成绩。工人福利事业委员会集中了保险金和文化费八万余元，举办了六宗抚恤，开支小米二千斤。泊头永华火柴公司建立了外工厨房，消除了因吃冷饭生病的现象。保定发电厂和铁工厂成立了职工合作社，专供给工人及其家属消费品；并经营着电力带动的磨面作坊，每天能赚一千元，职工买面时，每斤低于市价一元。化学厂为扶植工人福利专业的发展，把本厂经营的电池厂，由工人积蓄工资二十万元，转让给工人经营，年终结帐时，赚了原资本的六倍。此外，尚有六个工厂建立职工业余学校，有六百零七人参加了学习。火柴、化学等四个工厂建立了工人俱乐部。但各厂工人福利事业工作尚有严重缺点：（一）工人合作社组织的不普遍，已经组织起来的还有单纯赚钱观点。火柴厂的工人消费社，为达赚钱目的，已转营商业。万聚皮厂把工人福利款用来囤积小麦。聚隆铁厂合作社，因为不按工人家属数目配给日用品，所以物价波动时，物品被争购一空，还有的把买自合作社的物品拿去转卖。（二）保险设备仍差。化学厂曾因此死亡一人，后又烫伤一人。火柴厂的药房股、装盒股，化学厂的三酸股，皮厂的皮轴股，成品的制造过程中，都含有很大毒素，但各厂对防毒设备都还未十分重视和改进。（三）火柴厂还残存着旧资本家的习惯，对十来年工龄的包装女工，例假不发工资，并强调所谓“偷盗者开除”的条例。实业公司工人福利委员会，根据以上检讨，已规定“劳动保险试行办法”，其中规定了处理因工受伤、残废、死亡以及女工生育等具体办法。各工厂并设病号休养室，厂内设外工休息室。职工医药费可投入公营或私营医院，以备职工随时治疗疾病。在可能的条件下，工厂可自设或联合设立卫生所或诊疗所。并抓紧组织工人合作社。根据各厂需要，加强保险设备与防毒设备。
