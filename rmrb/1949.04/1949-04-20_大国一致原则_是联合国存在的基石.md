　　The Principle of Great Power Unity
  　Is the Cornerstone of the United Nations' Existence
    Soviet delegation head Gromyko delivered a lengthy speech at the General Assembly, defending the United Nations Charter. Gromyko pointed out that the principle of unanimity among the permanent members of the Security Council constitutes the cornerstone of the United Nations' existence. Gromyko traced the principle of great power unity in the Security Council, which was adopted at the Yalta Conference based on President Roosevelt's proposal and included in the United Nations Charter at the San Francisco Conference as Article 27 of the Charter. However, those who opposed this principle launched an offensive against the veto power from the very beginning of the United Nations' establishment. Gromyko pointed out that the noise about the "veto" right is not accidental; it is a manifestation of a certain plan by the ruling groups of some major powers, who want to turn the United Nations into their docile tool. However, their plans have not succeeded due to the Soviet Union's position supporting the consolidation of the United Nations. Those who oppose the principle of great power unity insist that the Soviet Union has abused the "veto" power in the Security Council, which is groundless. This accusation is an attempt to deceive public opinion, so that the public does not understand who should be responsible for the Security Council's failure to properly resolve many important issues. Gromyko analyzed the Security Council's discussions on Greece, Indonesia, Palestine, the establishment of international control of atomic energy, and universal disarmament. He cited various facts to prove that the obstacles to the smooth resolution of these issues were not due to the "veto" power, but to the policy of certain major powers turning the United Nations into a docile tool and undermining the organization. Gromyko then emphasized that the principle of great power unity is a dam that blocks all attempts by the American ruling group to turn the Security Council, and the entire United Nations, into their docile tool.
    He further pointed out that the Soviet Union's defense of the principle of great power unity is not only in the interests of the Soviet Union, but also in the interests of the people of other countries who do not want war. Such a war would only benefit arms dealers and the large monopoly capital that makes a fortune from the war.
    Under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations General Assembly passed a motion "recommending that the Security Council members increase the number of resolutions not subject to veto," while the Soviet Union's proposal was rejected by the General Assembly.

### 大国一致原则　是联合国存在的基石

　　大国一致原则
  　是联合国存在的基石
    苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯在大会上发表长篇演说，为联合国宪章辩护。葛罗米柯指出：安理会中常任理事国一致的原则，构成了联合国存在的基石。葛罗米柯追溯安理会中大国一致的原则，虽然是雅尔塔会议根据罗斯福总统的建议通过，并在旧金山会议上列入联合国宪章，作为宪章第二十七条，可是，那些反对这一原则的人，从联合国成立之日起，就发动了反对否决权的攻势。葛罗米柯指出，关于“否决”权问题的吵闹，并不是偶然的，它是某些大国的统治集团一定计划的表现，他们想把联合国变成他们的驯服工具，但是，由于苏联支持巩固联合国的立场，他们的计划未能成功。反对大国一致原则的人，硬说苏联在安理会上滥用“否决”权，这是毫无根据的。这种指责乃是企图欺蒙舆论，使舆论弄不清楚安理会之未能恰当地解决许许多多的重要问题，究竟是谁应该负责。葛罗米柯分析了安理会关于希腊、印尼、巴勒斯坦、建立原子能国际管制、普遍裁军等问题的讨论。他引证各种事实，证明阻碍这些问题之顺利解决的，不是因为有“否决”权，而是某些大国把联合国变成驯服工具和破坏这个组织的政策。葛罗米柯继而强调指出，大国一致的原则是一条堤坝，它阻挡美国统治集团把安理会、把整个联合国变成他们驯服工具的一切企图。
    他又指出，苏联保卫大国一致的原则，不仅符合苏联的利益，而且也符合其他不想战争的各国人民的利益。这种战争只有利于军火商人，只有利于从战争中间发大财的大独占资本。
    在美国的操纵之下，联合国大会通过了一项议案，“建议安理会理事国增加不受否决权限制的决议数件”，而苏联的建议案则被大会否决。
