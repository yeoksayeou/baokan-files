[Jinan Electric] By March 25th, Southern Hebei had planted a total of over 2.2 million trees along riversides, village edges, barren sandy areas, and roadsides, exceeding the Administrative Office's original plan by 50%. The First Administrative Region of Yuan Dynasty has already planted 836,237 trees. In the Third Administrative Region, six counties including Linzhang, Jize, Cheng'an, and Ci'xian, have planted a total of 467,759 trees, creating thirteen windbreaks of various sizes. The Fourth Administrative Region, including nine counties such as Guangzong and Ningnan, has planted 81,873 trees. During the movement, mass-based exchanges of techniques and labor were actively promoted. Villages in Yuan Dynasty widely hired craftsmen to guide transplanting and grafting, while in the Third Region, labor was exchanged with grafting craftsmen. In Xiqin Village, technical craftsmen taught eighteen elementary school students how to graft apricot, peach, and plum trees, who then took turns helping others. When planting, Xiajin adopted a scientific method to ensure survival: digging pits, soaking them with water, then adding a layer of dry soil before planting the trees. Handan advocated watering each tree three times to ensure a survival rate of nine out of ten. In addition, various localities have adopted mass-agreed-upon regulations for protecting forests and trees to strictly prevent damage. The reasons for achieving these results are: first, as a result of land reform, farmers have land and are making long-term plans under the guidance of the Party's policy of getting rich through labor. Second, the active leadership and assistance in solving difficulties by governments at all levels and rural Party members and cadres have powerfully promoted the development of the movement. The Linqing Farm directly under the Administrative Office sold 52,000 large poplar saplings to various counties, and counties such as Linzhang promptly established forest protection committees to dispel farmers' concerns that no one would manage the saplings and they would be harmed.

　　冀南植树二百万株
  　群众技术劳力换工移种接木
    【冀南电】冀南植树造林，至三月二十五日止，全区河边、村边及荒沙地带、公路两旁共植二百二十余万株，超过行署原计划百分之五十。一专区元朝已植树八十三万六千二百三十七株。三专区临漳、鸡泽、成磁等六县，共植四十六万七千七百五十九株，造成大小防风林十三个。四专区广宗、宁南等九县已植八万一千八百七十三株。在运动中曾开展了群众性的技术与劳力换工互助。元朝各村纷纷聘请匠工指导移种接木，三区以劳力与接树匠工换工。西勤庄请技术匠教会十八名小学生接杏、桃、李树后，即轮流帮助别人。在插栽时，夏津采用了保活的科学办法，即挖好坑，用水浸后，放层干土再栽树。邯郸提倡每树浇三遍水，保证十株九活。此外各地均通过群众公订护林木规约，严防破坏。获得以上成绩的原因：首先是由于土地改革后，农民有了土地，在党的劳动致富的政策思想指导下作出长远打算的结果。其次各级政府与农村党员、干部的积极领导与帮助解决困难，有力地推动了运动的开展。行署直属临清农场，将五万二千株大白杨树苗分售各县，临漳等县及时成立护林委员会，解除农民怕树苗被祸害没人管的顾虑。
