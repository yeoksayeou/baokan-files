　　Announcement of Decision by the North China People's Government on Unified Management of Public Housing and Property
    [Report from this newspaper] Regarding the handling of public housing and property in North China, the North China People's Government recently issued a circular, the original text of which is as follows: "The Jinnan Administrative Office sent a letter to the Judicial Department of this government, stating that after the Third Special District Office moved to Handan, the city's housing was very limited. The new offices of the Special District are still in the countryside, which is very inconvenient for leadership. It is requested that the North China Housing Bureau allocate 80 to 90 rooms of public property for residence in order to save construction expenses and facilitate work, etc. It is found that after the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, the entire North China region has been basically completely liberated. All levels of Party, government, and civilian organizations and groups must move to cities for office work in order to carry out urban construction, closely connect the city and the countryside, and facilitate leadership. Housing must be appropriately adjusted and resolved. The former official offices in the city, as well as the barracks, warehouses, and real estate built during the period of enemy and puppet rule, should also be properly repaired and protected in a timely manner. To this end, the following decisions are made regarding all public housing and property in North China: 1. All public housing and property in North China, except for those approved by this government as real estate for organs or those priced as factory, store, mine, kiln, land, and forest investments, all public housing and property that have not been approved by this government or priced but are occupied shall be uniformly managed and adjusted by the administrative office, provincial government, and directly-administered municipal government. If direct management by the administrative office, province, or city is inconvenient, the lower-level government may be designated to manage it. 2. In order to manage public housing and property, the administrative office, province, or city may, depending on the complexity of the work, set up a public property management office, section, or public property administrator in a certain place to be responsible for handling daily affairs such as public property repair, leasing, adjustment, and distribution. 3. If public housing and property in North China need to be sold or demolished, it must be reported to this government for approval. Without the approval of this government, it shall not be sold or demolished. The administrative office or province and city have the power to represent this government in handling the daily leasing, repair, adjustment, and residence. 4. Except for the barracks and other public real estate that have been approved by this government to be exempt from rent, other organs, groups, schools, and public and private personnel occupying public real estate must pay rent according to the rental price stipulated by the administrative office, province, or city. Those who do not pay rent or deliberately damage the real estate, the administrative office, province, or city may stop their residence and occupation, and may order compensation. 5. All public real estate rental income shall be used exclusively as a fund for repairing and renovating real estate and shall not be used for other purposes. If there is more rental income, it will be used to develop urban construction, which shall be reported by the administrative office, province, or city to this government for approval. 6. After the North China public real estate is handed over to the administrative office, province, or city for management, if this government needs it, it may temporarily notify the administrative office, province, or city to return it, and the administrative office, province, or city shall not refuse to return it under any pretext. 7. The administrative office shall formulate management measures for provincial, county, and village public real estate, which are not within the scope of this regulation. 8. Special scenic spots and historical sites shall be managed separately by the cultural relics preservation committee organized by the cultural authorities, which are also not within the scope of this regulation. It is hoped that each administrative office, province, and city will relay the above to its subordinates for compliance. The housing problem of the Third Special District Office of Jinnan shall also be adjusted and handled by the administrative office according to the above principles."

　　华北人民政府公布决定
  　公房公产统一管理
    【本报讯】关于华北公房公产的处理，华北人民政府顷发出通令，原文如下：顷据冀南行政公署致函本府司法部，以该区第三专署移住邯郸后，因市房很少，专署自新所尚在乡村，领导诸多不便，请由华北房屋内拨给公产八九十间住居，以节省修建开支，便利工作等情：查平津解放后，我华北全区已基本上全部解放，各级党政民机关团体，为进行城市建设，密切城市与乡村连系，便于领导起见，均须移住城市办公，房屋必须加以适当调剂解决；而过去城市之官署，以及敌伪统治时期所修建之兵营仓库房产，亦应及时加以适当修缮和保护，为此特对所有华北公房公产，作如下决定：一、凡华北公房公产，除经本府批准作为机关之房产，或经作价成为企业投资之厂店矿窑房地森林外，其未经本府批准或未作价而占用之公房公产，悉由行署省府直辖市府统一掌握管理调剂；如行署省市直接管理不便时，并得指定下级政府管理之。二、行署省市为管理公房公产，得视工作繁简，设置某地公产管理处、科、或公产管理员，负责处理公产修缮租赁调剂分配等日常事务。三、凡华北公房公产，如须出卖或拆毁时，均须呈报本府核准办理，未经本府核准者，一概不得出卖或拆毁；其平时租赁修整调剂居住，行署或省市有代表本府全权处理之权。四、除部队营房及其他经本府批准免出租金之公房产外，其他机关团体学校，及公私人员占用之公房产，均须按行署省市规定之租赁价交纳租金，不出租金或故意损毁房产者，行署省市得停止其居住占用，并得责令赔偿。五、一切公房产租赁收入，专作为修补整理房产之基金，不得挪作他用；如租赁收入较多，再用以发展城市建筑，由行署省市呈报本府核准办理之。六、华北公房产交行署省市管理后，本府如有需要时，得临时通知行署省市交还，行署省市不得借故不交。七、省县村公房产统由行署规定管理办法，不属于本范围内。八、特殊名胜古迹，另由文化机关组织文化古物保管委员会管理之，亦不在本范围内。以上希各该行署省市转令所属遵照办理；冀南三专署自新所之房屋问题，亦依上列原则由行署调剂处理之。
