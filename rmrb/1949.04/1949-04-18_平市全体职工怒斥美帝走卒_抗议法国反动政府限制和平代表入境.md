　　Beiping's Entire Workforce Denounces American Imperialist Lackeys
　　Protests Against French Reactionary Government Restricting Entry of Peace Representatives
　　[Reported by This Newspaper] Upon hearing the news that the French reactionary government had brazenly decided to restrict the entry of delegations attending the World Congress of Supporters of Peace into France, workers in enterprises and factories throughout Beiping City expressed extreme indignation and unanimously lodged protests. The Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Pingjin Railway Trade Union Federation, and 46 other trade union organizations, representing the city's workforce, jointly issued a letter of protest, excerpts of which are as follows:

To the Chinese Delegation to the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, forwarded to the Preparatory Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace: Under the conspiracy of American imperialism, aimed at instigating a new world war of aggression and endangering human peace and security, and driven by its vassal states, including the reactionary governments of England, France, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, and Italy, after signing the North Atlantic Treaty on April 4th, peace-loving people from all countries around the world, for the sake of human peace and security, unwilling to let this pack of wolves, these executioners of humanity, drag mankind into the whirlpool of war, have successively expressed their attitudes, issued protests, and exposed their conspiracies, and elected their representatives to attend the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Paris. However, as this congress is about to convene, and as representatives from various countries are about to arrive in Paris, American imperialism and its lackeys, fearing that this congress will express the wishes of over 600 million peace-loving people around the world, the French reactionary government, under the direction of its master, American imperialism, has unreasonably restricted the entry of peace representatives, attempting to weaken the powerful reaction that the Peace Congress has created worldwide. This is despicable, shameless, and foolish. The peace forces of the world are strong and unparalleled, and no conspiracy or means can stop the development of the peace movement.

We warn the warmongers that the anti-people's aggressive bloc is bound to fail, and the peace-loving people of the world are sure to defeat them. The liberation of all mankind and lasting peace will surely be realized.

Finally, we, the entire workforce of Beiping City, are determined to unite closely with the peace-loving people of the world, resolutely support the Peace Congress, and lodge a serious protest to the French reactionary government.

　　平市全体职工怒斥美帝走卒
  　抗议法国反动政府限制和平代表入境
    【本报讯】当法国反动政府悍然决定限制出席世界拥护和平大会的代表团入境的消息传至北平后，北平各企业工厂职工都表现了极度的愤慨，一致提出了抗议。北平市职工总会筹备委员会、平津铁路职工总会筹备委员会等四十八个单位职工会，代表全市职工特发表抗议书，摘要如下：
    中国出席世界拥护和平代表团转世界拥护和平大会筹委会：在美帝国主义以挑动新的世界侵略战争为目的的危害人类和平安全的阴谋下，驱使着他的附庸国英、法、挪、丹、冰、荷、比、卢、葡、意等国的反动政府在四月四日签定北大西洋公约后，全世界各国爱好和平的人们，为了人类的和平与安全，不愿让这群豺狼这群毁灭人类的刽子手们把人类卷入战争的旋涡，都先后表明了他们的态度，发表抗议与揭穿他们的阴谋，并选出了他们的代表，到巴黎去出席全世界拥护和平代表大会。但是在这个大会将要召开，且世界各国代表将到巴黎的时候，美帝国主义和它的走卒们，惧怕这个大会将表示出各国六万万余爱好和平的人们的愿望，法国反动政府在它的主子美帝国主义的指使下，竟无理的限制和平代表入境，想以此来削弱和平大会在全世界所造成强有力的反应，这是卑鄙无耻而且是愚蠢的，全世界的和平力量，是坚强无比的，任何阴谋手段都阻不住和平运动的发展。
    我们警告战争贩子们，反人民的侵略集团一定要失败的，爱好和平的世界人民力量是必然可以战胜他们。全人类的解放与永久和平是一定要实现的。
    最后，我们全北平市的全体职工，决与全世界爱好和平的人民，紧密的团结在一起，坚决的拥护和平大会，并向法国反动政府，提出严重的抗议。
