Small Suggestion

　　Residents Should Repair Seepage Ditches and Pits
    In order to maintain public health, the Peiping Municipal Government established a Cleanliness Campaign Committee and launched a cleanliness campaign. This matter was also held several times in the old society, but it only achieved temporary results, and soon became dirty and unbearable again. In order to prevent this from repeating the mistakes of the past, I would like to offer the following suggestions regarding hygiene for your reference:
    (1) In addition to the covered drains repaired on the main streets of Peiping, there are mostly no seepage facilities. All the sewage and urine from the households are poured onto the streets. Recently, the district government has prohibited this, and the households have changed to dumping it secretly at night. If each household near the covered drain could be ordered to build a seepage ditch in the courtyard leading to the covered drain on the street, and those farther away could dig seepage pits in the courtyard according to the number of people, then this problem would be solved.
    (2) Children's feces: Because most of the sanitary facilities in households are old-fashioned cesspools, people avoid the danger by letting their children defecate on the streets near walls and corners of houses. If one family does this, every family does this, and if there are sick children, this is a breeding ground for infection. In the future, children should be strictly prohibited from defecating on the streets, and parents will be held responsible for violations.

### 住户应修渗水沟坑

　　住户应修渗水沟坑
    北平市政府为维护公共卫生，成立了清洁运动委员会，发起了清洁运动。此事在旧社会时亦曾数次举办，但只能收一时功效，不久便又肮脏不堪。为使此次不蹈以前覆辙，现将愚见所及有关卫生二事提出以供参考：
    （一）北平除各冲要街道修有暗沟外，多无渗水设备，各住户秽水便尿全部倾倒街上。近来区政府禁止，各住户又改为夜间偷倒。若能饬各靠近暗沟住户在院内修筑渗水沟通往街上暗沟，其离稍远者在院内按人口多寡挖渗水坑，则此问题即解决了。
    （二）小孩粪便：因各住户卫生设备多旧式粪坑，人们为避免发生危险，多让孩子在街上墙根屋角大便。一家如此，家家如此，若有病孩，这就是传染的渊薮。今后应严禁小孩在街上大便，违者家长负责。
