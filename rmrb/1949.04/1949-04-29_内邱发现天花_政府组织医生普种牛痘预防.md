    【Taihang News】Since mid-March, smallpox has been found to be prevalent in the areas of Dong, Xi＠ming, Gaowang, and Xingxiu in Neiqiu, resulting in the deaths of four children. An adult woman has gone completely blind due to contracting smallpox. To prevent the spread of smallpox, the government convened an emergency meeting of doctors, organized doctors to vaccinate in the affected areas first, and then sent cadres to various districts to organize doctors for mass vaccination with cowpox. Vaccination efforts have been combined with health and epidemic prevention publicity. Most districts and villages in the county have now completed vaccination. The masses have expressed great satisfaction with the democratic government's concern for the people's interests.
