　　Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 17th -- Chiang Kai-shek's hardcore followers, persisting in evil, continue to direct Kuomintang planes to bomb and strafe the East China Liberated Areas. According to incomplete statistics from March in Jiaodong, Northern Jiangsu, and Jianghuai areas, a total of 158 Kuomintang planes came to attack, bombing 23 times and strafing more than 80 times, killing 94 peaceful residents, injuring 185, destroying 139 civilian houses, and 37 civilian boats. From April 1st to 11th, that is, during the period when the Kuomintang government's negotiation delegation arrived in Beiping to hold peace talks with the CCP, Kuomintang planes continued to bomb and strafe Jingjiang, Yangzhou, Liuweigang, Wuwei and other places in the Suwan Liberated Area, killing 9 peaceful people, injuring 17, and destroying more than 10 houses and 3 civilian boats. These bloody debts prove that it is entirely necessary for the Chinese people to demand the punishment of war criminals who persist in evil.

  　沪杭学生活动遭禁止
    【新华社蚌埠十七日电】国民党飞机在怙恶不悛的蒋介石死党指挥下，不断轰炸、扫射华东解放区。据胶东、苏北、江淮等地三月份的不完全统计，来袭国民党飞机共一五八架，轰炸二十三次，扫射八十余次，炸死和平居民九十四人，伤一百八十五人，毁民房一百三十九间，民船三十七只。从四月一日至十一日，亦即在国民党政府和谈代表团抵平与中共举行和平谈判期间，国民党飞机仍继续向苏皖解放区之靖江、杨州、六圩港、无为等地轰炸扫射，炸死和平人民九人，伤十七人，毁房十余间，民船三只。这些斑斑血债，证明了中国人民要求惩办怙恶不悛的战犯是完全必要的。
